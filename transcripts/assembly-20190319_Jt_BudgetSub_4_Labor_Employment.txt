I'D LIKE TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO THE JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- WITH THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FOUR AND LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE -- AND I'LL BE. RUNNING THE SHOW RIGHT NOW -- SAMBAR COOPER COULDN'T MAKE IT THIS AFTERNOON -- HOWEVER I DO WANT TO THANK HIM -- FOR JOINING -- WITH OUR COMMITTEE -- IN IN SETTING THIS HEARING UP AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE. OF OF THIS ISSUE. TODAY ABLE HEAR AN OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO EXPAND. THE PROGRAM AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO WELCOME AT THE DIRECTOR HANGING HERE WITH US TODAY. WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM A PANEL STAKEHOLDERS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN ISSUES CONSIDERING EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT I'M HONORED TO CAN BE IN THIS HEARING ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE A CRITICAL ISSUE. FOR CALIFORNIA'S WORKING FAMILIES. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE FUTURE WORK IN OUR COMMITTEE AND THE ISSUE OF HOW WE CREATE POLICIES THAT SUPPORT WORKING MOTHERS AND FATHERS -- WE KNOW IS RELEVANT AS EVER WERE HEARTENED BY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO EXPAND. PARENTAL LEAVE TO SIX MONTHS. I HOPE TO LEARN MORE TODAY ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IS DEFINITELY A WORK IN PROGRESS. WITH SIGNIFICANT DETAILS TO BE HAMMERED OUT AS WELL. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- WE CAN AND MUST DO MORE TO GET WORKERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BOND WITH AND RAISE THEIR CHILDREN WE KNOW. THAT THAT THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING DEPENDS ON THAT AS WELL. WELL CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THE ISSUE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE NEEDED WE NEED TO DO BETTER. WE NEED TO BETTER ADDRESS THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF OUR EVOLVING WORKFORCE. WE MUST ASK OURSELVES IS ARE CURRENTLY SISTER SYSTEM MEETING THE NEEDS OF PART TIME WORKERS IMMIGRANT WORKERS SINGLE PARENTS WERE LOW INCOME WORKERS. I WOULD SAY OF THAT IT'S NOT AND I BELIEVE THE RESEARCH SUPPORTS THAT CONCLUSION. I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN HEARING OF RECOMMENDATIONS TODAY -- ON HOW TO MAKE FAMILY LEAVE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE A NOT JUST FOR THE STATE TO HAVE A CERTAINLY A FOR ALL WORKERS AS WELL. AND I CERTAINLY INVITE ANY OF OF MY COLLEAGUES TO THE LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENT. ALL RIGHT -- AND I THINK IT'S IN A RIVER WICKS AND SHOOT A FOR BEING HERE I KNOW WILL HAVE AFTERNOON. AND SO -- WHY DON'T WE BEGIN -- WITH THE DIRECTOR OF OUR EMPLOYMENT OF EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT. THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT -- PATRICK HEADING. THANK YOU IS THAT WHEN THE COLOR AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY. PEOPLE -- FOR FOR COMMUNITY HERE MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT FAMILY THAT'S GOING TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE DID A GREAT JOB OF A SUDDEN THAT OUT IN THE COMMITTEE -- DOCUMENTS BUT VERY QUICKLY CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM ALLOWS -- OVER EIGHTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE UP TO SIX WEEKS OF BENEFITS. IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. A TO BOND WITH THE CHILD. OR TO CARE -- THERE'S A THIRD CATEGORY THAT WAS ADDED -- LAST YEAR BY -- GOVERNOR BROWN THAT ALLOWS FOR SOME THE CALLED EXIGENCY. WHICH IS TO ALLOW FOR FAMILY TO PREPARE FOR OUR MILITARY FAMILIES AS THEY ARE ABOUT TO GO OVERSEAS AND THAT COMES INTO PLAY. JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR. AS WE GET OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS EXCEPT -- FOR READY FOR THAT NEW PART OF THE BENEFIT -- PAID HIM LEAVE IS A PART OF THE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS THE SAME TYPE OF WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR INJURIES -- THAT HAPPENED TO FOLKS OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE AND SUPPLEMENTS SORT OF THE OTHER SIDE OF WORKERS COMP IS WHAT I OFTENTIMES TELL PEOPLE -- BUT GETTING BACK TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- BONTA CLAIMS THAT THE THE PEOPLE THAT COMBINED ARE THE BIOLOGICAL OR FOSTER OR ADOPTIVE PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AS WELL STEP PARENT. OR SOMETHING ALSO CALLED -- LOCAL PARENTIS WHICH ALLOWS THE COURT SYSTEM -- TO SET UP THINGS -- THE LIKE OF BOARDING SCHOOLS THERE TO BE ABLE TO BOND WITH THE CHILD MAKE SURE THAT THE CHILD IS MOST COMFORTABLE -- SO FAR AS TO YOU CAN CARE FOR THE CARE SIDE. CHILDREN PARENTS PARENT LAWS GRANDPARENTS SPOUSE REGISTERED DOMESTIC -- PARTNERS AND I THINK THAT. THE CARE SIDE OF THINGS WHEN YOU LOOK AT PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- WELL THE UTILIZATION RATE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CARE -- IS RELATIVELY LOW -- FRANKLY AS COMPARED -- TO FOR BONDING BUT IT IS IN AREAS I'M REMINDED OF SAME A FRIEND FROM THE A. R. P. HERE -- THAT BONDING AS OUR SOCIETY CONTINUES TO A TO TAKE CARE OF OUR GREATEST GENERATION. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL THERE FOR THEM -- IT GIVE THE CARE -- THAT THEY NEED AND THAT WHAT I'D ALSO SAY THIS IS CHILDREN WHO OFTENTIMES FIND THEMSELVES MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY THOUGHT THAT WOULD GET THEMSELVES INTO. ALSO TO CARE -- FOR YOUR CHILDREN AS THEY GO THROUGH A LIFE AND NEED SOME OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY CARE. PAID FAMILY LEAVE AS I MENTIONED IS THE THAT'S THE SORT OF THE BROTHER OR SISTER -- TO STI THEIR FUNDED THROUGH THE SAME -- TAXING PROGRAM WHICH IS THAT I I DID WANT TO MAKE SURE I MENTION THIS -- THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS MENTIONS IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY -- A FORMULA -- THAT I GET A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOVES UP AND DOWN -- EVERY YEAR -- AND THIS THE FUND GOES I'M SURE EL IT WAS AWFUL SO -- MENTION IT -- FLUCTUATES I CAN GO ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE POINT 5% OF EMPLOYEES WAGES OFTENTIMES WHAT YOU'LL SEE IT MARKED DOWN ON YOUR PAYSTUB IS. C. S. TI CALIFORNIA -- STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE. I KERN RAISE ABOUT 1% -- THE TAXABLE WAGE BASE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND WITH -- A MAXIMUM BENEFIT OF ABOUT. TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK -- YOU HAVE TO PAY INTO THIS FOR THE PREVIOUS -- QUARTERS COMING UP A LEADING UP TO THE PROGRAM -- AND MUST BE OR ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR WORK. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CARE YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE PERSON RECEIVING THE CARE. AS WELL AS A TREATING PHYSICIAN THAT WERE GIVING THAT CARE -- AND THEN FOR TO COME TO BONTA JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE PROOF OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN -- THE CHILD AND THE PERSON TAKING CARE OF THEM. BUT WHICH REPLACED RATES THIS IS A NEW -- I THINK IT WAS THE GOMEZ BILL OF A FEW YEARS BACK -- THAT ALLOWED -- THE WAGE REPLACEMENT TO GO UP BASED ON WAGES AND AND START AT LEAST 60% OF WAGES. PLACES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND I BELIEVE LOS ANGELES IS CONSIDERING -- AND I BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WOMAN -- CONSULTS IS ALSO TAKING THAT LEGISLATION TO BRING THAT ALL WITH 2100%. OF WAGES -- BUT CURRENTLY THOSE OF THE WEIGHT REPLACEMENT RATES -- THAT WE HAVE NOW. WE HAVE THE EDT DEBIT CARD -- WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS BOTH A BIT OF A AS WELL AS HE SAID TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE GET THOSE PAYMENTS. IT'S VERY EASY TO TRANSFER THOSE MONIES OVERTOOK DIRECT DEPOSIT TYPE SITUATION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE DEVIL CARD -- TYPE SITUATION -- SOME FOLKS HAVE BROUGHT UP CONCERNS ABOUT THAT FEES OFTENTIMES CHARGE THERE -- WE TOOK -- SOME ACTION TO MAKE SURE SYSTEM TO IN THE CONTRACT IN ARE BORN OF THE STATE -- BUT THAT BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT FROM MY PROPOSAL JUST TO GIVE YOU A REAL BRIEF OVERVIEW OF IT I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS HERE -- ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE THE THANK YOU A DIRECTOR HANDING AND JUST. JUST IN TERMS OF POWER SET THIS UP THE FIRST PANEL IS GOING TO BE AN OVERVIEW OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET AND THEN THE NEXT PANEL WILL DISCUSS ISSUES CONSIDERING EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE SIR TO CONTINUE WITH THIS FIRST PANEL WE HAVE DANIELLE BRAND OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL GRANTED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS DIRECTOR HAVING SAY THEY STATED CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM CURRENTLY ALLOWS WORKERS TO TAKE UP TO SIX WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE ANNUALLY. TO CARE FOR SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER OR A BOMB WITH A NEWBORN OR NEWLY ADOPTED CHILD WITH THE CURRENT REACH WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE OF UP 270% OF SALARY BASED ON INCOME LEVEL. THE PROGRAM WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF THE STATE'S DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM SUPPORTS CHILD DEVELOPMENT IN THE CRITICAL FIRST FEW WEEKS OF LIFE. PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH SHOWS THE PROVIDING UP TO SIX MONTHS OF PAID PARENTAL LEAVE TO BOND WITH THE NEW CHILD LEADS TO POSITIVE HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR THE CHILDREN. GREATER ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR PARENTS AND LESS STRAIN. ON FINDING AN AFFORDABLE AND FORDING AND THINK CARE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO EXPANDING THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT ALL NEWBORNS AND KNEW THE ADOPTED BABIES CAN BE CARED FOR BY A PARENT OR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS. IN THE SHORT TERM THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO ADJUST THE RESERVE REQUIREMENT. FOR THE FUND THAT SUPPORTS THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. THIS CHANGE WILL ENABLE THE STATE TO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR WHILE MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE RESERVE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONVENE A TASK FORCE TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO PHASE IN AND EXPAND THE PAM PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO ALLOW CHILDREN. TO BE CARED FOR BY A PARENT OR CLOSE IF FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS. THE TASK FORCE WILL CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS COST FUNDING SOURCE IMPLEMENTS TO IMPOSE SORRY IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE AND OTHER RECENT LESS THAT LEGISLATION SUCH AS A. B. NINE AWAIT FOR MEMBER GOMEZ. AND OPTIONS TO INCREASE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AMONG ELIGIBLE WORKERS AMONG OTHER THINGS. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONSIDER OTHER CHANGES INCLUDING ALIGNMENT OF EXISTING WORKER PROTECTIONS AND NON RETALIATION PROTECTIONS TO INCREASE THE ABILITY OF ALL WORKERS TO EXCESS THESE IMPORTANT BENEFITS. FINALLY I JUST NOT THIS PROPOSAL STILL BEING DEVELOPED AND I'M BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS I CAN ANSWER AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU THE MOBILE EQUIPPING THEM TO THE PANEL THE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ANYONE ON THE PANEL. YES AND THEN -- UP NEXT WE HAVE CHAS ALAMO AND SAID. CHRISTIAN KIRSTEIN WITH THE IS A CHRISTINE. CHRISTINE BUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAS ALAMO WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THAT THE TWO COMMITTEES FOR INVITING US TODAY ON FOR OUR TESTIMONY WE PLAN TO COVER A COUPLE. SORT OF MAJOR POINTS THAT WE INCLUDED IN IN A HAND OUT THAT WE'VE RECENTLY RELEASED THAT CONSIDERS OPTIONS -- THAT THE STATE WE THINK SHOULD CONSIDER -- IN EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE THAT YOU HAVE THAT HANDOUT AVAILABLE -- ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANTED TO LOOK OUT IN A IN THIS HANDOUT WAS TO COMPARE. CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM TO LEAVE PROGRAMS IN OTHER STATES AND TO LEAVE PROGRAMS OTHER COUNTRIES -- SO BEGINNING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE -- AS YOU KNOW THE U. S. IS THE ONLY HIGH INCOME COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT DOES NOT HAVE A NATIONAL PAID FAMILY LEAVE POLICY -- SO OBVIOUSLY WITH THAT IN MIND WE THINK OF COMPARING CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES TO THOSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES -- THE TWO BIG DISTINCTIONS THAT WE WOULD DRAW IN THE INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE -- OUR FIRST THAT. BY AND LARGE OTHER COUNTRIES TEND TO OFFER LONGER LEAF DURATIONS AND CALIFORNIA DOES AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MATERNITY LEAVE. BECAUSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT'S MORE OFTEN THE CASE THAT MATERNITY LEAVES OUR OFFER FOR A LONG DURATION FOR A LONGER DURATION I SHOULD SAY RELATIVE TO PATERNITY LEAVE FOR IN CALIFORNIA THERE PEOPLE DURATION SO. IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THAN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE SECOND DISTINCTION THAT I WOULD POINT OUT -- RELATIVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES IS THAT. OTHER COUNTRIES TEND TO STRUCTURE THEIR PROGRAMMES DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO -- THIS MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A NUMBER OF WAYS ONE EXAMPLE JUST -- FOR ILLUSTRATION IS CANADA IN CANADA NEW PARENTS SO THINKING OF BONDING CLAIMS SPECIFICALLY. NEW PARENTS CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO OPTIONS THEY CAN CHOOSE TO TAKE A SHORTER DURATION LEAVE BUT RECEIVE A HIGHER WAGE REPLACEMENT. OR THEY CAN CHOOSE A LONGER LEAVE PERIOD AS A LOWER WAGE REPLACEMENTS OF BASED ON THE FAMILIES ON CIRCUMSTANCES -- TURNING TO OUR COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES ON PAGE EIGHT OF OUR HAND OUT. WE INCLUDE A FIGURE THAT SORT OF POSITIONS CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES. AND AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO IMPLEMENT PAID FAMILY LEAVE SENSE THAN. FIVE ADDITIONAL STATES MOST STATES HAVE SIMILARLY STRUCTURED PLANS STATE THEY LARGELY RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER -- DESPITE THAT. A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE WOULD POINT OUT -- THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN CALIFORNIA. THE STATE'S WAIT REPLACEMENT RATE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS 60% FOR MOST WORKERS IS TOWARD THE LOWER END AMONG OTHER STATES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE WEEKLY MAXIMUM. BENEFITS OF THE CAP WHICH IS THE WEEKLY MAXIMUM -- A BENEFICIARY CAN RECEIVE WHILE ON LEAVE IS MUCH HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA THAN IT IS IN ANY OTHER STATE. SO. WITH THESE COMPARISONS IN MIND. THE DECISION THAT THE LEGISLATURE FACES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS REALLY IS FIRST AND FOREMOST WHETHER TO EXPAND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AND SECONDLY IF. SO HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT. AND SO IN THINKING ABOUT THE LATTER HOW ONE WOULD GO ABOUT EXPANDING LEAVE WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT HOPES TO ACCOMPLISH BY EXPANDING LEAVE. AND THEN TO CONSIDER AND PUT INTO PRACTICE THE BEST POLICY OPTIONS RIGHT TO SAY THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLICY OPTIONS THAT COULD ADDRESS WHAT YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH -- FOR INSTANCE ARE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR AND IDENTIFYING EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AS THE PRIMARY USE OF MOTIVATING FACTOR. AND FOR THAT IN ORDER. TO ADDRESS THAT GOAL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CONCEPTUALLY TO EXPAND THE DURATION OF LEAVE. AND ALSO TO MAKE LEAVE MORE FLEXIBLE. NOW ON THE OTHER HAND THE LEGISLATURE PRIMARY MOTIVATION OR GOAL MAY BE DIFFERENT -- FOR INSTANCE IF LEGISLATORS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO USE PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO. THE TAKE UP RATE FOR THE STATE'S CURRENT PROGRAM. EXPANDING THE DURATION OF LEAVE MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLICY WE THANK. ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE COULD. SERVE CONSIDER OPTIONS TO INCREASE OUTREACH SO THAT AWARENESS IS IMPROVE THE PROGRAM OR POTENTIALLY CHANGES TO THE WEIGHT REPLACEMENT RATES THINGS THAT ARE MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE THINK COULD DRIVE -- HIGHER TAKE UP RATE THAN THAN WE AND AND WE ALSO WANTED TO LOOK. AT OPTIONS FOR FUNDING PAYING FOR AN EXPANDED -- POLICY. AND AT THIS PRELIMINARY STAGE MINDFUL THAT WE'RE STILL VERY EARLY ON IN THE GOVERNOR'S IS PROPOSING TO FORM A TASK FORCE TO CONSIDER THESE OPTIONS. OUR OFFICE DIDN'T SCORE A SPECIFIC. OPTION OR A SCENARIO -- WITHIN SCORE THE GOVERNOR'S CONCEPTUAL PLAN FOR ISN'T FOR INSTANCE WE TOOK A BIT. OF A BROADER LANDS APPROACH AND WE ASKED OURSELVES. FOR THINKING ABOUT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE SO YOU HAVE THIS. THE PAYROLL TAX RATE THAT CAN MOVE UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF BENEFITS THAT ARE GOING OUT IT'S CAPPED AT ONE POINT 5% WE SET OURSELVES. HOW MUCH COULD BENEFITS INCREASE? WITHIN CURRENT LAW WITHOUT MAKING CHANGES TO LAW AND ALSO STAYING UNDER THE ONE POINT 5% CAP. AND WE THINK. THAT. PAYROLL TAXES COULD INCREASE WITHIN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. TO SUPPORT AT LEAST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. NOT LIKELY MORE THAN TWO BILLION NOW -- EACH YEAR AND AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS. AND WE THINK THIS IS SORT OF A USEFUL BENCHMARK THIS ONE TO TWO BILLION MARK -- KNOWING THAT CURRENT PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS EACH YEAR ARE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IT JUST PROVIDES OUT ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AS TO WHAT THE SERVER. POTENTIAL OF THE EXISTING FINING WE NEED TO MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES -- THAT SAID. AND EXPANSION THAT GOES BEYOND THAT AMOUNT. WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFIED ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE OR CHANGE STATE LAW TO A SERV. MAKE CHANGES TO THE THE EXISTING -- ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS -- WITH THAT I'LL TURN NOW TO MY COLLEAGUE SET TO FINISH OUR PRESENTATION. SEC KIRSTINE LA -- THE LAST FEW PAGES OF OUR HANDOUT DESCRIBES SOME OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOCUSING. PRIMARILY ON THE EFFECTS OF LENGTHENING LEAVE BENEFITS -- WE DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT LENGTHENING WE'VE BENEFITS IS NECESSARILY PREFERABLE TO OTHER OPTIONS SUCH AS MY COLLEAGUE REFERRED TO LIKE RIP. INCREASING THE REPLACEMENT RATE -- THAT SERVE WHICH OPTION IS WORTH PURSUING SIR DEPENDS ON THE LEGISLATURE'S GOALS AND HOW THOSE LINK UP TO THE DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU -- THE MAIN REASON WE FOCUS ON ONE THING BENEFITS IS SIMPLY THAT THAT'S THE OPTION THAT'S BEEN STUDIED THE MOST EXTENSIVELY IN THE LITERATURE -- I'LL HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE SETS OF FOR FACT OF LEAVE BENEFITS ON PARENTS EMPLOYMENT WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SHORT TERM EFFECTS AND LONG TERM EFFECTS. SO THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS WELL PARENTS ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TO ARE UNCERTAIN WITH SOME EVIDENCE POINTING TOWARD SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN PARENTS EMPLOYMENT. AND OTHER EVIDENCE POINTING TOWARDS MINIMAL AFFECTS. ONE OR TERM THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFECTS OF ON PARENTS EMPLOYMENT BEYOND. THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF THEIR KIDS LIVES WOULD LIKELY BE PRETTY SMALL. TURNING TO THE EFFECT ON KIDS WE FIND IT SIMILARLY USEFUL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM AFFECTS. ALL LONGER LEAVE BENEFITS LIKE WE WOULD IMPROVE INFANTS HEALTH. AT THE SAME TIME THE LONGER TERM EFFECTS ON THE KIDS HEALTH EDUCATION AND LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES ARE. UNCERTAIN WITH SOME EVIDENCE POINTING TO SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS AND SOME EVIDENCE POINTING TO MINIMAL EFFECTS SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR TESTIMONY AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY. THANK YOU ALL OF ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS -- WORKS THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING TODAY I'M. THE MOTHER OF A TWO YEAR OLD A BIG SUPPORTER OF PAID LEAVE I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THAT THAT EARLY TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY REALLY IS -- ESPECIALLY YOUR BRAND NEW PARENTS -- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD IS -- JUST CONCERN AROUND -- THIS THE FACT THAT I THINK ARE LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE NOT -- PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO SEE BUT ALSO I WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. GIGA CONNIE WORKERS -- AND THE CHALLENGES THERE MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS IS GOOD ECONOMY WORKERS MANY OF WHOM I THINK -- MISCLASSIFIED AND WE HAVE CHALLENGES AROUND SAME KIND OF PROTECTIONS -- THAT OTHER WORKERS HAVE AND THAT FOR PAID LEAVE THEIR UNDER A SEPARATE PROGRAM IS THAT RIGHT IS THAT THE DISABILITY INSURANCE SELECTIVE COVERAGE. YEAH DEC MY UNDERSTANDING IS WITH THAT PROGRAM MOST. YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT CONTRACT WORKERS -- COULD GET COUNTY WORKERS DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT EXISTS -- I SAW A STUDY THAT SAID IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF THE TURN FORTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS CLASSIFIEDS IS ONLY THIRTY TWO DECIDED. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THIRTY TWO WORKERS -- SO. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. YES AGREEING ON THAT -- YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT THERE'S IT'S IT'S CUMBERSOME THERE'S MANY STEPS -- AND AGAIN MANY THESE WORKERS I THINK OUR MISCLASSIFIED AND NOW WE HAVE OTHER PENDING LEGISLATION TO HELP RECTIFY THAT ISSUE -- BUT IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU ALL ARE ADDRESSING IT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE TYPES OF PROTECTIONS BECAUSE THESE ARE TEND TO BE LOWER WAGE WORKERS -- TEND TO BE WOMEN OF COLOR TEND TO BE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE. BUT THE SOMEONE WHICH I WOULD SAY THAT -- WE HAVE DONE SOME WORK BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. FRANKLY -- IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THE PROGRAM STARTED -- THE LIGHTS IN THE STATE WERE STARTING TO FLICKER ON THE ECONOMICS WERE DOWN -- IN THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME AND THEN SUBSEQUENT GOVERNOR. DIDN'T PUT. ANY MONEY TOWARDS OUTRAGE. SO WE STARTED A PROGRAM WITH VERY LITTLE FUNDS -- IT'S PRIMARILY A MANUAL PROCESS EVEN TO THE STATE BECAUSE OF THAT THAT LENDS ITSELF TO SOME OTHER PROBLEMS. BUT WITHOUT BUT DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT GREAT IDEAS -- BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS A COUPLE YEARS BACK WE RECEIVED ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH SOME WORK OF SOME OF THE ADVOCATES -- HERE LATER ON TODAY TO START TO DO SOME OF THAT WORK A SOMEBODY WHO I KNOW WHO HAS DONE MEDIA BUYS AND KNOWS THAT WORLD. SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T GET YOU VERY FAR -- SO WE'VE DONE SOME WORK -- WE'VE DONE A LOT OUT REACH TO OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS I THINK THAT'S WOULD BE WHAT I WOULD CALL THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE WORK THAT WE DID -- WE STARTED TO DO SOME VERY TARGETED THAT'S OF THINGS -- BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS -- THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE QUICKLY TO THOSE LOW WAGE WORKERS WE HAVE DONE SOME WE HAVE SEEN INCREASES. NOT ONLY IN THE TARGETED AREAS OF LOS ANGELES THE HAS A LOW UPTAKE RATE I THINK THAT REFLECTS WHAT YOU SAW THE LA OWES REPORT -- AS WELL AS A MINORITY -- LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATIONS -- BUT THEN ALSO -- FRANKLY FATHERS -- IN TRYING TO GET THE UP TOOK A FATHER'S BEEN MORE INVOLVED IN THE FAMILY. AWAY FROM WHAT -- THIS IN ANTIQUATED VIEW OF THE FATHER'S ROLE IN THE FILM. LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AND OTHERS ON THIS PANEL AS A FATHER OF A THREE YEAR OLD -- THIS IS A TOPIC THAT IT'S VERY CLOSE TO HOME I DO HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION AROUND OUTREACH -- YOU MENTIONED THE CHALLENGES WITHIN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO COMMUNITIES I'LL TELL YOU THIS CONCEPT OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS REALLY NOT A DISCUSSION OF THE API COMMUNITY. EXCEPT FOR WITHIN WELL EDUCATED NOT SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF MORE RECENT API IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE TALKING ABOUT -- WHAT SORT OF EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE API COMMUNITY I CAN A MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE'VE DONE I DIDN'T MEAN TO CALL THOSE TO TWO PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES IN AS MUCH AS? THOSE WERE LARGER TARGETS BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS -- AND STUDIES THAT WE DID LEADING UP TO DOING THE OUTRAGE AND SPENDING THE ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO DO -- BUT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY SOMEONE TO TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE DON'T FOR THE API COMMUNITY LOVE TO LEARN AT THIS POINT OUR POPULATION IS IT AND AND I THINK RELATED TO THAT WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL ABOUT REACH. TO BE SPENDING THIS YEAR HAS HAPPENED CITED YET. THERE ARE NO AMEND I WOULD LOVE FOR DEAL LEFT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT WHAT I WOLD TELL YOU -- IS THAT THERE ARE NO -- FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR OUR EACH OTHER THAN -- GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM AND I WOULD SUGGEST AND HOPE THAT THAT IS A PORTION OF THE BUDGET AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- I WANT TO SHIFT FROM A TO THE LA -- DISK WE FOUND YOUR ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING OTHER COUNTRIES TO BE INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT -- AMERICA'S WAY BEHIND WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING IN THIS AREA AND YOU SAY TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STUDIES IN THIS AREA. HAVE A ANY STUDIES WERE COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED AROUND THE INVESTMENT AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND HOW THAT IMPACTS. LONGER TERM EXPENDITURES WHEN IT COMES TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM OUR EMPLOYMENT SYSTEM OR SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM. I THINK WE ALL AND TO REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE DOLLARS THAT WE INVEST TODAY AT THE EARLY AGE WITH PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND CHILD CARE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION -- HAS ENORMOUS DIVIDENDS LONGER TERM BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AND GIVEN HOW MUCH WOOD SPERRY THERE IS I WAS ONE IF YOU COULD SHARE THAT. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO -- IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM FISCAL IMPASSE LONG TERM OUTCOMES ON THE KIDS AT LEAST SORT OF THAT -- SORT OF IN THE IN THE MAIN WAY THAT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT THERE MAY BE OTHER CHANNELS TO BUT I THINK THAT SORT OF ONE THAT THAT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK ABOUT FIRST. FIRST AND I THINK SORT OF WHAT WE IT BRIEFLY MENTION IN THE HANDOUT IS SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE ANSWER BASED ON THE RESEARCH AS AS WE'VE VIEW IT -- THE LAW OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE EFFECTS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SO CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT THAT -- THAT THERE COULD BE A LARGE -- LONG TERM BENEFITS THEN POTENTIALLY THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF A SAVINGS OR OTHER BENEFITS REALIZE BUT BUT TO US THE EVIDENCE IS AND ALL THAT CLEAR THAT THAT DOES AFFECT OUR LARGE OR OR WHETHER THEY COULD POTENTIALLY BE. MINIMAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME OF HIS OFFICE. SO I I WANT -- TO OBVIOUSLY LOW INCOME WOMEN FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS DON'T HAVE REALIZE THIS BENEFIT THE SAME NUMBERS AS OUR COHORTS ANOTHER. CLASSES I GUESS -- HAS THERE BEEN ANY -- I I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONJECTURE ON OUT REACH AS WELL AS INCOME REPLACEMENT -- AS WELL ASSINGLE PARENTS VERSUS A TWO TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD WHICH MIGHT HAVE LEAD TO THE FLEXIBILITY OF BEING ABLE -- TO TAKE TIME OFF WITH A SMALLER BUT HAS THERE BEEN ANY STUDIES TO ACTUALLY ASK THESE WOMEN WHO ARE NOT EDITED OR MAN BUT I'M I'M. PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH SINGLE MOMS -- IN LOW WAGE JOBS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS FOR THE REASONING WHY. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY. I DON'T KNOW ANY PARTICULAR ROUTE THE TOP OF THE HEAD I THINK I'LL DO THE CAPTION LATES IT. KIND OF WELL IS THAT THERE IS A WIDE BREADTH OF STUDY. ON THE SUBJECT I I CAN'T PREDICT POINT TO A PARTICULAR ONE I THINK THAT THE POINT THAT YOU'RE KIND OF GETTING AT IS. THIS IS A TAX ON WORKERS AND SO YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT 1% AS AN AWFUL LOT PARTICULAR AT THE LOWER WAGE SCALE RIGHT -- PLACES LIKE THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE -- SUPPLEMENTED THE REST OF THE WAY TO FROM EMPLOYER TAXES THAT CAN KHALEEL ALSO MENTION. OTHER COUNTRIES AND SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. AND WHILE CALIFORNIA -- MAY SEEM LIKE IT'S BEHIND IN SOME AREAS -- THEY OFTENTIMES WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS A BLENDED. TAX STRUCTURE WHEN IT COMES THIS IN RIGHT NOW -- SYSTEM IT IS SOLELY FUNDED BY WORKERS. AT SOLELY FUNDED BY THE FIRST HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A WORKER MAKES CREDIT SO WHILE -- THE THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME THAT IS PAID IF YOU'RE MAKING SAY -- TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND BECOMES FAR LESS THAN THE PERSON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME THAT THEY'RE MAKING AN EVEN A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND THEM HALF HALF THE AMOUNT OF THEIR INCOME. THE CLEAR DEFINITION OF A REGRESSIVE. TAX CHANGE. AT THAT LEVEL THAT HAD THE BENEFIT IS CAPPED AT ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO YOU DO HAVE A CAP OF THE BENEFIT THAT YOU CAN RECEIVE FROM. AT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- WHICH YES WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE IN A YEAR -- MY CONCERN AND I'VE BEEN VERY HONEST I RESERVE A BILL ON IT IS IS THAT -- LOW INCOME FOLKS BEEN PAIN THAT'S NOT UTILIZING AND PARTICULARLY CONCERNED -- AS WE RECOGNIZE AS A BODY THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE ON ON WHAT IS IN A MINIMUM WAGE -- AND YET NOT REALIZING THAT THAT THEM WOMEN TAKING PARTICULARLY SINGLE WOMEN TAKING TIME OFF TO IT TO A CHILD AT 770% OF MINIMUM WAGE. IS PROBABLY NO MORE DURABLE THAN NOT RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE IN FIRST PLACE -- SO I I JUST A ALTHOUGH OUT REACH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT SOMETHING THAT I THINK HAS TO BE AND ALSO IN THE HANDS OF HUMAN RESOURCES AT INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES NEED TO PROVIDE SOME -- GOOD GUIDANCE TO WORKERS BUT THAT PERCENTAGE I THINK I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED OF OF WHAT'S REALISTIC AND I KNOW THAT OTHER STATES HAVE GONE FURTHER -- GETTING I THINK AS FAR AS 90% OF INCOME. I WILL TELL YOU -- INTO SOME OTHER STATES REACH VERY HIGH AND I THINK NEW YORK IS LOOKING AT MY MEMORY SERVES ME CLOSE TO A 100% -- BUT AGAIN IT'S A BLENDED TAX STRUCTURE -- I WILL TELL YOU I AND I KNOW IT'S A SMALL STEP FORWARD BUT FRANKLY FOR A PROGRAM THAT. IS ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD -- AND WITH THE SUPPORT THAT IS RECEIVED OVER THE YEARS -- THE THAT IT HAS DONE A MISSION -- I AM VERY PROUD THAT THIS GOVERNOR HAS TAKEN A LOT OF STEPPED IN FACT FRANKLY FOR THE FIRST TIME -- IN MY HISTORY WITH THIS PROGRAM AND I WAS THERE WHEN GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNED IT -- TOOK A FEW YEARS OFF THERE IN THE MIDDLE AND AND BACK UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME -- VERY PROUD THAT WE'VE TAKEN STEPS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME JUST LAST COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE MET WITH HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AND THEY'RE TAKING A VERY ACTIVE ROLE IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HIT THOSE FIRST TIME MOTHERS THAT. THAT TO ME THAT'S THAT WHO THAT NUCLEAR PLACE IF WE CAN GET TO THOSE MOTHERS WE CAN GET TO THOSE FAMILIES WHEN THEY FIRST COME TO THE DOOR TO LET THEM KNOW. THESE ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM THIS IS NOT A A GOVERNMENT HANDOUT IT'S NOT EVEN A A TAX PAID TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT EVENTUALLY TRICKLES BACK DOWN TO THEM THIS IS A DIRECT FEE THAT THEY PAY FOR THIS PROGRAM -- AND WE HAVE TO DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS NO SITE I SHARE YOUR PASSION FOR THAT SOMEONE. IF YOU FINISH YOUR SNACK A SUMMER JONES SAWYER. YES I'M FINISHED WITH MY SON AND WHEN SHE WANTS TO GO AHEAD. JUST SO YOU KNOW AT SOMETHING STUCK IN MY THROAT THE NURSE RECOMMENDED I OF SO. SO SO MY DAUGHTER JUST JUST RECENTLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO HAD MY GRANDSON. AND I REMEMBER SITTING TALKING. TO MY SON IN LAW. ABOUT ANYWHERE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR MY DAUGHTER WORKS REALLY UST AS A TEACHER. AND AT MY DAUGHTER AND I WORK FOR THE CITY OF LA FOR QUITE SOME TIME HIGH DAUGHTER AND I STARTED COMPARING HOW MUCH TIME I HAD OFFER PATERNITY LEAVE AND THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MEN AND PATERNITY LEAVE AND WE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT. YOU KNOW I COULD TAKE THIS DAYS OFF AND I CAME BACK WHEN I ALMOST WHEN I WANTED TO IT WHICH IS. KIND OF SEAMLESS WHEN WE TALK TO MY SON IN LAW. AS A MALE. TRYING TO BOND WITH HIS WITH HIS SON -- THEY TOLD MAYBE IT TO WAIT A WEEK SO IF YOU KNOW THE EARLY DATE THE EARLY TIME IS THEN AND THEY EXPECTED HIM. TO DELAY HIS BINDING BECAUSE THAT'S A MALE THING. TO DO AND IT HAD PROBABLY AT THE MANAGERS THAT GO BACK TO THE STONE AGES. BACK TO THE FIFTIES WHEN. WHEN -- MENDED TAKE OFF OR EVEN BOND WAS DENIED BECOMING CONCERNED BECAUSE SEEM LIKE THEY FROWNED UPON. HIM WANTING TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH HIS FAMILY -- AND I BEEN READING THROUGH THIS ICE SAW A LOT OF THINGS MENTIONING WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN I DIDN'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF THAT ABOUT. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE -- PATERNITY LEAVE THIS IS FAIR AND EQUAL EQUAL OUT. WHETHER YOUR PUBLIC SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR EVEN ACROSS DIFFERENT LINES WE HAVE A COLLEAGUE THAT'S OUT RIGHT NOW THAT HOPEFULLY WE RETURNING. AND NEXT MONTH. AND NO ONE'S EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT HAVING HIM COME BACK EARLY ARE OR HE NEEDS TO DO THIS OR HE NEEDS TO DO THAT BECAUSE I'M IN AND I'M IN AN ENVIRONMENT. THAT PRAISES AND SUPPORTS UP PATERNITY LEAVE -- SIDE I DON'T KNOW IF WE'D EVEN LOOKED AT WAYS WE CAN MAKE ENSURE THAT PUCK TOURNEY THE LEAF. IS SOMETHING THAT IS. THAT WILL HELP LAND BOND WITH THEIR WITH THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN AND THAT THEY HAVE KIND OF THE SAME. RIGHTS AND BENEFITS OR IF THERE. THERE'S SOME PREJUDICE TOWARDS THEM DO DOING THAT IF THERE'S ANY SAFETY VALVES AND THAT OR WE JUST AT THE WHIM FROM. COMPANY TO COMPANY A COMPANY A COMPANY OR THIS AGENCY DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER AGENCY -- LIKE I SAID MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE WE'RE TALKING AS IF. I HAD THE SAME BENEFITS AS HER AND WOULD IS AGO WHEN WHEN I HAD HER AND SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S IT'S A IS IT JUST. ME TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN I HAD HER IT JUST IT JUST AMAZING TO ME HOW -- IT'S AMAZINGLY DIFFERENT. I AGREE THAT MISTER JONES SAWYER FACT I I'VE BEEN PROUD THAT WE'VE TAKEN SOME OF THE MONEY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER TO DO OUTRAGE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THE LARGEST INCREASE -- IN -- FATHERS. STARTING TO TAKE LEAVE AND I WILL TELL YOU I I BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY MORE OF THAT STIGMA. A CULTURAL IN SOCIETY THAT IS VERY HARD FOR GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ATTITUDES ABOUT. BUT IT IS A WORTHWHILE PRACTICE -- HOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME -- COMMERCIALS THAT WE DID PARTICULARLY AROUND THAT THAT I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE. TO YES YES -- JUST SO YOU CAN GET A SENSE THAT BUT BUT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT IT'S A LOT MORE AROUND CULTURE -- WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS I'D LOVE -- TO SAY THAT -- MUCH LIKE A LOT OF THE UNION WORKPLACES I WORKED IN VALUE -- THE SIMILAR TYPE BENEFITS FOR BOTH OF MALE AND FEMALE WORKERS BUT OFTENTIMES THAT'S NOT THAT THINK THAT LA -- SPOKEN THEIR REPORT -- TO SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE THE LAW -- THIS STILL LEAVES ITSELF OPEN -- FOR DESIRE FOR CHANGE. INTERPRETATION. YES SIR. THANK YOU. I HAD A QUESTION OUTRAGE LOSING ALL MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL SO I I APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT ONE THING YOU MENTIONED -- OF THE DIRECTOR IS WORKING WITH THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WHEN -- THE MOTHERS GIVING BIRTH THE MAYBE CAN EXTEND THAT EVEN FURTHER TALK OF THE DOCTORS ON THE PRENATAL CHECKUPS ALL THAT SO WELL IN ADVANCE. I WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE -- OUR PARTNERS IN THE CMA OUT OF IT I I WOULD ALSO SAY -- THE SEE AND A OKAY WELL -- WE'VE DONE SOME OUTRAGE FOR THEM I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH BOTH THAT -- THEY OFTENTIMES FIND THEMSELVES AS PROTECTION PRACTITIONERS. OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM BUT I I AGREE WE WE CAN STILL DO MORE. AGAIN WE'VE DONE A LOT WITH THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE WERE STILL TRICKLING SOME OF THOSE -- DOLLARS AND LESSONS LEARNED. OUT -- BUT AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE EXPENDED ALL THE FUNDS WE HAVE REPORT THAT'S UP ON OUR WEBSITE IF ANYBODY. WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WHAT THE NUMBERS WE RECEIVE FROM THAT WE HAVE SEEN UPTICK. THE OVERALL UTILIZATION AS WELL AS AS I SAID TO MISTER JONES SAWYER IN PARTICULAR. FOR A PATERNAL. FATHERS USING THE SYSTEM BUT I I COMPLETELY FOR THEIR VERY DIFFERENT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REALLY HAVE KAISER -- THE SOCCER -- AND A FEW OTHER -- HEALTH CARE FACILITIES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH DIFFERENT STORY BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE DIFFERENCE OF PEOPLE GIVING CARE DOWN THE WHAT THE STEP WILL BE A TEAM EFFORT I I THINK -- WITH ALL INVOLVES APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN ONE QUESTION ALEJO'S OFFICE REGARDING BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PASSING IN THE HOLD THE THE THE CONCEPTUAL PROPOSALS OF THE SHARABLE ON TRANSFERABLE -- LEAVE OF A TEAM THE PARTNER'S WHAT HAVE YOU -- OR EVEN SINGLE PARENTS TOOK DOESN'T CLOSE RELATIVES OF THE AYE IN CONCEPT A GREAT HOW THAT ACTUALLY WORK TECHNICALLY. THOUGH IN TERMS OF THE THE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM OR IS THAT SOMETHING WE HAD THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SOME IN A BETTER POSITION TO SPEAK TO THIS BUT IN IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH. THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE PART OF FINANCE AND WITH OTHERS ONE OF THE KEY CONCERNS THAT THAT CAME OUT VERY EARLY ON WAS THAT THESE MORE. I'LL CALL THEM UNIQUE POLICY OPTIONS TRANSFER ABILITY FLEXIBILITY. WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TIME FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BUILD NEW TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO DO THESE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR HAS AS IN A WAY RE FRAMED. HOW WE THINK ABOUT PAID FAMILY LEAVE HE'S FRAMED IT AS -- SIX MONTHS OF LEAVE. FOR THE CHILD. BUT HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS OPERATED A PROGRAM AND HENCE TECHNOLOGY AROUND OPERATING A PROGRAM THAT IS SIX WEEKS OF LEAVE. FOR AN EMPLOYEE -- AND THAT FOR INSTANCE. IT'S NOT CLEAR WE WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY. SUS LINKING UP A PARTICULAR MOTHER AND A PARTICULAR FATHER OF THE SAME CHILD WHO WILL TAKE LEAVE AT THE SAME TIME WE WE DON'T TRACK THE THAT INFORMATION ON THING SOME OF THESE MORE UNIQUE. OPTIONS THE ONLY THING I WOULD FLAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY CHANGES WERE RE THINKING ABOUT THE PROGRAM I THINK THE FALLS. REALLY CLOSELY IN LINE WITH. WHAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE JUST THINK ABOUT THESE OPTIONS THERE ARE TRADE OFFS MAYBE IT TAKES LONGER BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURES TO INTEREST IN DOING AND? IT'S OBVIOUSLY A APPOINT START THE CONVERSATION AND I THINK YOU PUT IT VERY WELL AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S REFRAMING OF THIS AROUND THE CHILD AND WHETHER IT'S A PARENT. OR A CLOSE RELATIVE ALIGNED OPTION FOR THAT CHILD DURING A LONGER DURATION OF TIME TO HAVE THAT SUPPORT AND THE LOVE -- IS IS REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT -- I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR -- KIND OF A HAVING ALL OF US LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY I DON'T NOTICE ANY THOUGHTS OF MINISTRATION THAT. BUT WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE WHAT GOVERNOR DO SOME HAS NEXT. I GRANTED I THOUGHT. WELL OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WITH LOTS. THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH. UP NEXT WE WILL HAVE -- THE PANEL. ON THE ISSUES CONSIDER IN EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE'VE ALREADY KIND OF TOUCHED ON THEM. A LITTLE BIT -- AND WILL HAVE -- COMING UP. DOCTOR CURTIS CHAN. THE SAM DEPARTMENT. OF PUBLIC HEALTH [inaudible] JENNA GEHRY. THE CALIFORNIA WORKING FAMILY COALITION AND LEGAL AID. THAT CALIFORNIA WORK AND FAMILY COALITION. I LEGAL IN A WORK. AND AMID STAGGER WITH COFFEE LIMóN FEDERATION I THINK I KIND OF GOT ALL RIGHT. OKAY ALL RIGHT -- DOCTOR CHEN. SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND INTERESTS OF THIS REPEAT. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE HI MY NAME IS CURTIS CHEN FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS TAKING CARE OF FAMILIES PRIMARILY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE BAY AREA. I ALSO SERVED AS DEPUTY HEALTH OFFICER FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALSO MEDICAL DIRECTOR MATERNAL CHILD ADOLESCENT HEALTH -- IN ALL THESE HATS I WHERE I BELONG TO SEVERAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND SEVERAL STATE Y. CHILDREN'S ORGANIZATIONS. AND MY TWENTY YEARS I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS COME TOGETHER FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. SO THEY'VE ALL COME TOGETHER FOR THIS CONCEPT IN CENTRAL COMMON AGENDA CALLED EQUAL RIGHTS FOR PARENTAL LEAVE. BECAUSE OF THIS IMPACT ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND THE OVERALL HEALTH OF FAMILIES OVER THE LIFE COURSE. SO AT THE LEGISLATIVE. ANALYST'S HAVE EXPLAINED THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES AND THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY ESTABLISHED. HEALTH BENEFITS OF ANY SINGLE PUBLIC POLICY SO ALTHOUGH THERE'S RELATIVE TO SOME MEDICAL LITERATURE RELATIVE TO FOR EXAMPLE CANCER THERAPEUTICS. THERE'S SME LACK OF CLARITY ON THE ACTUAL IMPACT A RELATIVE TO OTHER SOCIAL ECONOMIC POLICIES THE HIT THE HEALTH IMPACT OF THIS IS EXTREMELY STRONG. THIS IS WHY SO MANY HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THIS. SO IN ADDITION TO THE ANALYSIS FROM THE FROM THE LEGISLATURE FROM ALEJO. I JUST PUT IT INTO FIVE OVERALL OVER ARCHING FRAMEWORKS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES. IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZING FOR THE LAST DECADE. SO THERE'S FIVE OF THEM SO ONE OF THEM IS THAT A P. PRIME TO LEAVE REDUCES TOXIC STRESS. PARTICULARLY FOR LOW WAGE FAMILIES -- AND THIS IS EVIDENT IN -- THAT SHOWS WHEN WE PASSED THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE POLICY THERE WAS THE ACTUAL DROP. IN INCIDENTS OF HEAD TRAUMA DUE TO ABUSE. THIS IS AN EVIDENCE THIS IS EVIDENCE OF ACTUALLY REDUCING TOP EXPRESS AN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ACES ON CHILDREN. THERE'S NO OTHER PUBLIC POLICY THE HAS THAT TYPE OF REACH NUMBER TWO MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH. THIS. PAY PARENTAL LEAVE ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE SYMPTOMS OF POST PARTUM DEPRESSION I HAVE AND ALSO PRENATAL DEPRESSION AS WELL. AND WE SEE THAT THERE SEVERAL FOLDS INCREASED IN POST PARTUM DEPRESSION MOST LOW WAGE EARNERS PURSES HIGH WAGE EARNERS. THE FIFTY THIRD ISSUE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. THE FIRST TWELVE WEEKS THE FIRST SIX MONTHS THEN EVEN EXTENDING TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. FOR EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THIS LEADS TO A LIFE COURSE OF LEARNING IN KINDERGARTEN READINESS. THE FOURTH ISSUE IS LIFE COURSE THEORY. SO THERE'S THREE COMPONENTS OF LIFE COURSE THEORY IN WHICH PAID PARENTAL LEAVE. PARTICULARLY -- STRENGTHENS THE FIRST ASPECT IS REACH. THERE'S NO OTHER POLICY IN WHICH EVERY HUMAN BORN IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE REACHED EVERY BABY IN EVERY SET OF PARENTS. THE SECOND IS THERE IS A CRITICAL WINDOW OF VULNERABILITY. OBVIOUSLY FOR A NEWBORN INFANTS UP TO SIX TO NINE MONTHS BUT ALSO THIS IS THE PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE PHYSIOLOGICALLY FOR THE WOMAN AND ALSO THIS IS THE GREATEST -- VULNERABILITY IN POST PARTUM DEPRESSION AND MENTAL HEALTH -- ISSUES. AND THE THIRD ASPECT IS THAT FROM A LIFE COURSE PERSPECTIVE. SCIENCE HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE INTERVIEW INTERVENING AT THIS EARLY STAGE FOR BOTH BABIES AND MOTHERS AND FATHERS. IS GOING TO LEAD TO A TRAJECTORY THAT LASTS AN ENTIRE LIFETIME PARTICULARLY IF THIS IS A POLICY THAT AFFECTS EVERYBODY AND EVERY COMMUNITY. THE FIFTH AND FINAL -- HEALTH PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THIS ADDRESSES RACIAL INEQUITIES AND RACISM. SO CURRENTLY IN THE UNITED STATES THE UTILIZATION OF PARENTAL LEAVE POLICY IS AN EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED BY WAGE LEVEL. AND REYES WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF WAGE REPLACEMENT IN UNITED STATES. WHEREAS WE RECOGNIZE OUR MANY LONG STANDING HISTORICAL AND STRUCTURAL REASONS FOR THESE INEQUITIES. IT'S REALLY A QUESTION FOR ALL OF US AS A STATE IS HOW DO WE NOW INSURER. IN EQUAL STARTING LINE FOR ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA SO -- IN THE AGREEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS -- ABOUT THE OVERALL HEALTH IMPACT -- MEDICAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS IN THAT'S WIDENING IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN UPTAKE OF A PARENTAL LEAVE. FOR EXAMPLE THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS WHO SEE. PRETTY MUCH NEARLY A 100% OF ALL WOMEN IN PRENATAL CARE. EMPHASIZE A POLICY STATEMENT. TO EMPHASIZE 1100% PAID PARENTAL LEAVE IS. THE POLICY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE. AND THE POLICY STATEMENT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACT OF PARENTAL LEAVE. ON THE MANY WOMEN ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WORK FOR SMALLER COMPANIES HISPANICS LOWER WAGE EARNERS AND THOSE WITH LESS THAN A COLLEGE EDUCATION. THEY'VE RECOGNIZE HAVING LESS ACCESS TO PAID LEAVE. THERE ARE SOME ISSUES IN WHICH THOSE. COMMUNITIES A MIGHT MAKE POSSIBLY A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE FOR THEM TO HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BABY. AT SIX TEN TWELVE WEEKS OLD TO BE WITH HER. MOTHER OR THEIR FATHER THIS IS THE MOST BASIC OF HUMAN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. FURTHERMORE THE MERIT ECONOMY A PEDIATRICS WHICH WHICH ARE SUGGESTED PORTRAITS OF OUTREACH NOT IN PREMIER KERR BUT ALSO IN PEDIATRIC CARE. FURTHER EMPHASIZE THE ISSUE OF EQUITY AND PAID LEAVE SO THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. SAID THE MOST PARENTS CANNOT OF OTHER CHILDREN. IT'S THE CHILDREN WHO SUFFER THE MOST. ALL PARENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BOND WITH AND CARE FOR THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN. DURING THE FIRST CRITICAL MONTHS OF LIFE. SO I APPRECIATE THE DILEMMAS THAT THE STATE HAS IN FRONT OF A AS IN FRONT OF US THERE'S A LOT AND FOR THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF A NUMBER OF WEEKS PERCENTAGE OF WHAT WAIT REPLACEMENT -- PATERNITY LEAVE FORCES MATERNITY LEAVE AND THE OUTREACH ISSUE THOSE FOUR ISSUES I WOULD JUST PUT ON THE LANDS OF RACIAL EQUITY AND SOCIAL EQUITY. SO THE FIRST THE FIRST ONE IS THE DURATION. SO WE APPRECIATE THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF TWELVE WEEKS WHICH IS THREE MONTHS PLUS IF -- THE BABY HAS A A SECOND PARENT THAT WOULD ADD UP TO SIX MONTHS. IT WE SHOULD STILL BE CLEAR THAT THE HEALTH COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT SIX MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS. IS THE RIGHT TIME SO THAT IS WHAT'S -- THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STILL ASKING FOR SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS SO I WE REALIZE THAT IT'S WE IN THE HEALTH PROFESSION TO FINANCE THAT. BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S MOST BENEFICIAL TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SO FROM A PEDIATRICS PERSPECTIVE IT FOR THINKING ABOUT MY THREE KIDS SIX MONTHS IS THE TIME FOR EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING. THE TIME THE WINDOW FOR POST PARTUM DEPRESSION THE RISK PERIOD FOR SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME OCCURS UNTIL NINE MONTHS SO THOSE ARE THE PARTICULAR REASONS HE SCRATCHED OUT TO THE WHL -- EXPECTS US TO HAVE SPREAD TO LEAVE UNTIL TWENTY SIX WEEKS SO -- THAT'S WHY THERE'S A THE WINDOW THE TIME FRAME IS SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS -- THE SECOND ISSUE IS WAIT REPLACEMENT IS ACTUALLY A SOCIAL CLASS EQUITY ISSUE. AND THERE'S MANY FACTORS I WOULD SAY SIX TO TEN FANTASTIC PROFESSORS IN CALIFORNIA CORE NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL LEADERS IN THE HEALTH IMPACT OF P. PARENTAL LEAVE. ONE OF THEM IS AT STANFORD MY A RASS US LATER. AND SHE A HIGHLIGHTED IN A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN ARTICLE IN THE JOURNAL HEALTH ECONOMICS THAT FMO LA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MINOR IMPROVEMENTS AND BIRTH WEIGHT. MP MATURITY WEIGHT AS WELL AS A DECREASE IT INTO MORTALITY MEASURE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. THE ONLY AMONG COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE MOTHERS. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THE UNITED STATES WHEN WE EIGHT RESOURCES ONLY FOR A PARTICULAR PRIVILEGED POPULATION. SO THE THIRD AND FINAL THE THIRD AN ALMOST FINAL ISSUE IS THE DISTRIBUTION DOUBLE OF LEAVE. BY GENDER WHEN I'M REVIEWING THESE ARTICLES OF THE INTERESTING ASPECT AS I I APPRECIATE THE LA ILLS -- ANALYSIS IS A WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN NORWAY SWEDEN GERMANY AT EACH INTERVAL INCREASE IN. PATERNITY LEAVE OR AND SENATORS AND PATERNITY LEAVE. THERE'S A IMPORTANT ASPECTS ON FAMILY DYNAMICS FATHER'S RESPONSIBILITY -- TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD IT TO BE ENGAGE WITH A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AT THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS BETWEEN. THE TWO PARTNERS SO IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THERE TO BE ADEQUATE INCENTIVES FOR THE HIGHER WAGE EARNERS IN SOME CASES THEY MAY BE THE FATHERS. TO BE ALSO BE TAKING LEAVE AS WELL. AND THE FOURTH AND FINAL COMMENT I HAVE IS REGARDING OUT REACH PUBLIC HEALTH HOSPITAL'S PEDIATRICIANS -- OBGYN ENDS HAVE ALL STOOD FIRM AND ARE ALL ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PARTICIPATING THERE ARE MANY CREATIVE WAYS IN WHICH OUT WHICH CAN BE DONE THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING CLOSELY WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS -- WE THINK THAT OUTREACH IS IMPORTANT METHOD TO ENSURE THAT ALL FAMILIES UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES. THE AVAILABILITY OF A PARENTAL LEAVE AND OVERALL PROCESS OF ACTUALLY. APPLYING AND RECEIVING THOSE BENEFITS. SO -- IS SO IN SUMMARY I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME YOUR INTERESTS -- THIS IS THAT -- FINAL FRONTIER THIS IS THE FINAL FRONTIER WHICH WERE WAY BEHIND. IN TERMS OF SOCIAL POLICIES ALL INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND THIS UNFORTUNATELY HAS THE BIGGEST IMPACT FROM A LIFE COURSE PERSPECTIVE ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SO WE LOOK AT IT WE IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THIS UPCOMING YEAR TO ENSURE THERE'S A POLICY. THAT CARES FOR ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR CAN. I JUST HAD ONE QUICK QUESTION I KNOW WE'VE GOT OTHER PRESENTERS BUT I'D ASK A QUESTION TO THE LA -- BEFORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU COULD PROJECT ANYTHING ABOUT -- THE IMPACTS ON HEALTH CARE COSTS OF INVESTING NOW. AS WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE AGAIN WE ALL INTUITIVELY BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL SAVE. LOTS OF DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE AND YOU SPECIFIC HEALTH BENEFITS THAT COME OUT THAT WE KNOW IF YOU COMPARE COHORT OF FOLKS. WHO HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE VERSUS FAMILIES THAT DON'T WHAT THE LONGER TERM HEALTH IMPACTS ARE? IS THERE ENOUGH IN THE LITERATURE TO THINK TO ANALYZE WHAT THE INVESTMENTS. LEADS TO AS FAR AS LONGER TERM HEALTH SAVINGS YEAH I I AGREE WITH THE ANSWERS THAT ON THERE'S HUNDREDS OF STUDIES -- AND THERE'S HUNDREDS OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT BY I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND A SINGLE DOCUMENT I THINK. THAT'S A GOOD I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH THERE TO TH. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS THE LEADERS DURING THIS YEAR OF A WORK GROUP TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH SOME ESTIMATE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WITH. A GEHRY. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME SO I'M GONNA GARY AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL AID AT WORK -- AND I MEAN THEIR WORK AND FAMILY PROGRAM AND SO SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE WORK AND FAMILY PROGRAM HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE RIGHTS OFLOW INCOME WORKERS PARTICULARLY. PREGNANT AND YOU PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS MAKING SURE THEY HAVE JOB PROTECT THE TIME OFF ARE GETTING PAID AND HAVE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS -- IN ADDITION TO REPRESENTING CLIENTS IN LITIGATION WE ALSO DO A LOT OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND WE MAN A WORKING FAMILY HELP LINE THAT'S AVAILABLE STATEWIDE. SO EACH YEAR WE HEAR FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND WORKERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH FAMILY RELATED ISSUES AT WORK -- THE STORIES OF OUR CALLERS AND OUR CLIENTS HAVE REALLY GIVEN US INSIGHT INTO THE CURRENT GAPS IN THE LAW. AND INSPIRED US TO PUSH FOR CHANGES -- WE ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA WHERE SHIN. AND SO WITH OUR PARTNERS WE REALLY FOCUS ON HOW OUR LOW INCOME WORKERS BEING LEFT BEHIND IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. SO TODAY I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT THREE SPECIFIC BARRIERS THAT WE SEE COME UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE KEPT IN MIND WE'RE CONSIDERING AN EXPANSION OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THAT WOULD INCREASE THAN EQUITIES WE SEE IN THE PROGRAM. SO THE FIRST ONE SEVEN CALIFORNIA ARE JOB PROTECTION IN INCOME REPLACEMENT LAWS ARE NOT WELL LINE. WHICH MEANS MANY PEOPLE ARE DENIED ACCESS THE FAMILY LEAVE OR HAVE TO CUT THEIR LEAVE SHORT. SEVEN AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY THE CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM VIRTUALLY COVERS ALL PRIVATE EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE AND ALLOWS AN ACCESS SIX WEEKS. OF INCOME REPLACEMENT WHILE THEY'RE CARING FOR A NEW CHILD OR CARING FOR A SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER. THE PROBLEM IS THE ENTIRELY EMPLOYEE FUNDED PROGRAM ONLY PROVIDES MONETARY BENEFITS IT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SORT OF JOB PROTECTION. THIS MEANS YOU CAN BE FIRED LEGALLY FOR ACCESSING BENEFITS YOU PAY. FOR THAT'S BECAUSE OUR JOB PROTECTION LAWS THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT -- A LOT THE WHICH ALLOWS WORKERS TO TAKE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OF JOB PROTECTED BUT UNPAID TIME OFF FOR THEIR OWN SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION. TO CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER THE SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION OR TO BOND WITH A NEW CHILD ONLY APPLIES TO EMPLOYEES WHO WORK AT COMPANIES WITH FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES WITHIN A SEVENTY FIVE MILE RADIUS. HAD TO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A YEAR AND YOU HAD TO WORK A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO YOUR LEAVE. NOTHING SAYS SENATOR JACKSON -- SB ANY EIGHTEEN DID EXPAND THIS JOB PROTECTION FOR NEW PARENTS DOWN TO A TWENTY EMPLOYEE THRESHOLDS. HOWEVER THIS STILL LEAVES WORKERS WHO WORK FOR SMALLER COMPANIES BELOW TWENTY OR WHO WORK PART TIME OR WHO HAVEN'T BEEN THERE YEAR. VERY VULNERABLE WHEN A NEW TRIAL COMES INTO THEIR LIFE OR FAMILY MEMBER GETS STALE THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO TAKE ANY TIME OFF OF WORK. UNFORTUNATELY LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LESS LIKELY TO BE COVERED BY THESE JOB PROTECTIONS. AND WE'VE HEARD FROM COUNTLESS COLOR IS TO HEAR ABOUT PAID FAMILY LEAVE WHICH IN ITSELF IS A GREAT THING THAT THEY'VE HEARD OF IT. AND THEY GO TO TELL THEIR EMPLOYER THEY WANT TO TAKE THESE BENEFITS AND THEY'RE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO. A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SURVEY FOUND THAT ALMOST TWO OUT OF FIVE EMPLOYEES WERE WHO ARE ELDERLY USED VIA FILE. CHOSE NOT TO APPLY FOR BECAUSE THEY FEARED LOSING THEIR JOB OR NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. SO ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH HE IS THE DURATION A EVER ARE JOB PROTECTION ARE PAID ON MATCH UP IS THE DURATION OF LEAVE LIKE I SAID OUR JOB PROTECTION LAWS. ALLOW FOR TWELVE WEEKS OF TIME OFF WATER PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM OFF ONLY AFTER SIX WEEKS OF BENEFITS. NOW FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAID LEAVE THIS MEANS THEY HAVE TO CUT THEIR LEAVE SHORT BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD IT -- IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND CHILDCARE FOR A SIX WEEK HERE OLD. AND THEREFORE -- LOW WAGE WORKERS PARTICULARLY A I PARTICULARLY WOMEN WE SEE OUR FAIR MARKET THE JOB MARKET -- YOU REVERSE LEE LIMóN THEIR FUTURE EARNING CAPACITY AND CAREER PATH. LASTLY IF THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY MEMBERS WITHIN OUR JOB PROTECTION LAWS AND OUR WAITER PLACEMENT PROGRAM OR DIFFERENT SO THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE LAW NOW COVERS YOUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR CIVILIANS GRANDPARENTS GRANDCHILDREN PARENTS. PARENTS ALLIES -- IN ADDITION TO PARENTS SPOUSES REGISTERED DOMESTIC PARTNERS AND CHILDREN OF ALL AGES -- WHICH IS GREAT AND WE LOVE THAT EXPANSIVE DEFINITION BUT UNFORTUNATELY TO GET JOB PROTECTION YOU ONLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE JOB PROTECTED LEAVE IF IT'S YOUR PARENT. AIR SPELLS OR YOUR MINOR CHILD -- AND SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO FALLS ILL AGAIN CAN GET THESE BENEFITS BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB TO GO. TO TERRON THAT'S EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC. AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES DO NOT LOOK THE SAME AS THEY DID DECADES AGO. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A RECORD SIXTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE OR 20% OF THE US POPULATION LIVED WITH MULTIPLE GENERATIONS UNDER ONE ROOF AND CALIFORNIA HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES IN THE US. ANOTHER MAJOR BEARISH OUR CLIENTS ACCESSING THE PAID FAMILY PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN TOUCHED UPON IS THE CURRENT WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE. SO IF YOU'RE MAKING MINIMUM WAGE AND PARTIAL INCOME WON'T ALLOW YOU TO PAY THE RENT OR EXPENSES ESPECIALLY WITH A NEW BABY IS JOINING THE HOUSEHOLD. ALTHOUGH AB NINE OH EIGHT THE BILL THAT RAISE THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE TO SIXTY OR 70% WAS A GREAT FIRST THAT. IT'S SIMPLY JUST NOT ENOUGH FOR MANY WORKERS SO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THANKS TO CENTER WIENER IS LEADERSHIP THE SAN FRANCISCO PASSED THE FIRST OF ITS KIND PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ORDINANCE. THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES EMPLOYERS AND SAN FRANCISCO TO TOP UP THE STATE BENEFITS TO WORKERS IN SAN FRANCISCO GET A 100% DURING THOSE SIX WEEKS -- FORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN A GREAT SOME REALLY PROMISING RESULTS THAT SHOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU GET TO FULL PAY. SO EARLY ADMINISTRATIVE DATA INDICATES A 6% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN TAKING MONEY LEAVE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR THE ORGANS WHEN THE FACT FIRST OF THE FIRST. HALF OF THE YEAR AND THE YEAR PRIOR AND THIS IS A COMPARED TO VIRTUALLY NO CHANGE IN THE REST OF THE STATE. AND THEN MORE INTERESTINGLY THERE WAS A 28% INCREASE IN MEN TAKING BONNIE LEAVE AND SAN FRANCISCO AS COMPARED TO A THREE POINT 9% INCREASE OVER ALL -- IN ANOTHER INTERESTING. FINDING FROM THE STUDY IS THAT SUPPORT OF OUR VERY SUPPORT OF OTHER PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ORDINANCE WITH ONLY 6% OPPOSE. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF EMPLOYERS REPORTED THAT THEIR SUPPORT OF THE ORDINANCE BUT EITHER IMPROVE OR NOT CHANGE IF IT WERE FUNDED THROUGH A PAYROLL TAX. SOMETHING WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN EXPLORING WAYS TO FUND AN EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM AND HOW WE PAY FOR IT. SO THE FINAL BARRIER WHICH I THINK WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IS SIMPLY THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND THERE'S WIDESPREAD CONFUSION BECAUSE AS I JUST EXPLAINED. OUR PAYS THE PAPER VERSION AND THE JOB REDUCTION THEY DON'T LINE UP AND THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE. SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN IN EFFECT FOR OVER A DECADE. WE NOW FOR MY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIELD POLL THAT ONLY THIRTY PER 6% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHERE WHERE THE PROGRAM. WHICH IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE FROM 43% HOME WHERE THE PROGRAM IN TWENTY ELEVEN IT'S ACTUALLY WHERE NESS HAD WENT DOWN -- IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO CALIFORNIA WORKING FAMILY COALITION AND SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR EDT FROM DOCTOR OUTRAGE ON PFL. WHICH WE HIRED -- EDT TALK A BIT ABOUT WHICH WAS GREAT CAN ONLY PROVIDE INFORMATION ON INCOME REPLACEMENT IS A DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THAT ENFORCES ARE JOB PROTECTION LAWS AND THEREFORE CAN ONLY TALK ABOUT JOB PROTECTION. AND THERE'S SIMPLY NO COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH FOR SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY EDUCATE ON THE FULL. SCOPE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO TAKE RENTAL LEAVE [inaudible] AND IN ADDITION PEOPLE LACK ACCESS BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS ND NEED ASSISTANCE IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. TO THE BIGGEST BEARS WE SEE IS THE PAPER APPLICATION WHICH MOST LOW INCOME WORKERS USE IS NOT EVEN IN SPANISH IT IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH. AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A HUGE BARRIER. SO JUST SIMPLY PUT OUR FAMILY MEDICALLY LAST NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE OF ALL THE NEED TO WORKING FAMILIES WHEN A NEW TRIAL COMES IN THE HOME OR FAMILY MEMBER IS ILL. ACCESS LEAVE AS BOTH PAID AND JOB PROTECTED IS TRULY ESSENTIAL. WHAT CALIFORNIA'S LED THE WAY AND FAMILY'S SUPPORT OF WORKPLACE POLICIES THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD DO? I'M SURE THAT WORKERS CAN TAKE LEAVE WITHOUT RISKING THEIR JOBS EDUCATE WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. EXPAND FAMILY LEAVE RIGHT TO TRULY MEET THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES THANK YOU. HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THANK YOU LESTER WORKS I GET JUST A QUICK COMMENT A QUESTION FOR MS CAREY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS -- YOU ALSO TOUCH ON SOMETHING -- I THINK IS WORTH PUTTING A FINER POINT TO THAT NO WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE CHILD AT TO THE YOU KNOW -- IT PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND WE ALSO DON'T HAVE AT AND EXACERBATES THE GENDER PAY GAP. SAID AS BIGGER SOCIETAL ISSUES FOR US SO I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE CONTEXT AT HOME PORT THESE PROGRAMS ARE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY -- BUT ONCE SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR YOU THE THE WORKERS THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM -- ACCESS -- TO PAID LEAVE DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATE HOW MANY WORKERS USING THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA. EITHER JOB PROTECTION OF THE PAID LEAVE. THE FORTUNE -- WILL VIRTUALLY ALL EMPLOYEES PAY INTO IT IT'S ALL PRIVATE EMPLOYEES -- BUT I YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I THINK THE LAST IT IS LIKE I SAW IS THAT LOW INCOME WORKERS MADE UP IT BUT ONLY 24% OF THE CLAIMANTS RECEIVING THE BENEFITS OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- AND THEN MISDIAGNOSIS. CLOSE TO A QUICK FOLLOW AT TIMES BECAUSE YOU CUT YOURSELF -- BUT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OF COURSE NOT ALL. OF PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS ARE INVOLVED IN OUR PAID LEAVE PROGRAM IN SOUTH OF ACT ALL THAT I JUST PRESENTED ON TEACHERS SO. WHEN A HIGHLIGHT THAT SOMEHOW WE'VE -- EXCLUDED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND AND THAT HAS A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT I THINK IT'S YEAH ABSOLUTELY. YEAH. THANK YOU HAVE A STRIKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH STAGGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION -- WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME IN HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IT'S ONE THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEARTS WE WERE PROUD TO SPONSOR THE BILL THAT CREATED THE PROGRAM BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO AND IT'S REALLY BECOME ONE WHERE WE WHERE OF THE PROGRAM IN THE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. THE BENEFITS ARE SO CLEAR AND OBVIOUS THAT IT'S IT'S KIND OF HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE WE HAD THAT THAT. IT USED TO REALLY BE JUST KIND OF THE NORM THAT PARENTS. DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO TIME TO BOND WITH THEIR KIDS OR TIME. TO CARE FOR A SICK LOVE ONE AND THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN SUCH STRONG ADVANTAGE OF IT THAT. IT REALLY IS JUST PART OF OUR CULTURE DIRECTOR HAVING TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN CHANGING CULTURE WELL THAT'S TRUE. WE DO THINK THAT THIS REALLY STANDS OUT AS A SHINING EXAMPLE PUBLIC POLICY THAT HAS DONE THAT THAT HAS CHANGED THE CULTURE AND HAS PLAYED A VERY DECISIVE ROLE IN. NOT ONLY CHANGING INDIVIDUAL WORKERS LIVES BUT ALSO CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE AS A STATE LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF BONDING WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND TAKING CARE OF LOVED ONES AND SO. WE'RE WERE HUGE SUPPORTERS OF THE PROGRAM AND VERY MUCH WANT TO PROTECT IT AND EXPAND -- IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT SIX WEEKS IS OFTEN NOT ENOUGH THE THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR AND THOSE OF US WITH CHILDREN KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS YOU KNOW IT'S SIX WEEKS TO IMAGINE JUST WALKING AWAY AND PUTTING IN A DAY CARE AT THAT IS AT THAT AMOUNT OF TIME IS. A VERY VERY HARD THING TO WRAP YOUR HEAD SO -- IS SOMETHING THAT WE VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IN TERMS OF EXPANDING AND THE THE LENGTH OF BENEFITS THE THE WAGE REPLACEMENT WHATEVER WE DECIDE MAKES THE MOST SENSE BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SUPPORT. AND WE HOPE THAT THIS RENEWED FOCUS ON THE PROGRAM GIVES US A CHANCE TO RESTORE WHAT WE THINK IS A LONG OVERDUE CONVERSATION ABOUT FINANCING. WHERE -- IT WAS MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS PANEL THAT WE ARE REALLY KIND OF AN OUT LIAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAY THAT WE FINANCE OUR PROGRAM IN THAT WORKERS PAY 41100% OF IT -- OF THE SEVEN STATES WELL SIX STATES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THAT DO HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. IT'S JUST CALIFORNIAN RHODE ISLAND THAT ASK FOR WORKERS TO PAY FOR THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. AND I TRIED TO GO THROUGH THE THE IOWA WEBSITE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT LOOKS LIKE IN OTHER COUNTRIES -- AND IT'S A IT'S KIND OF HARD TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S ON THERE BUT IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO FIND A COUNTRY THAT. DOES THE SAME THING THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES EITHER HAVE EMPLOYERS PAY FOR ALL OR SOME OF THE PROGRAM. AND SO WE REALLY DO KIND OF STAND OUT AND THE FRUSTRATING THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY THE BILL THAT CREATED IT HAD SIX WEEKS FOR WORKERS. AND IN SIX WEEKS FUNDED BY A SIX WEEKS FUNDED BY WORKERS IN SIX WEEKS FUNDED BY EMPLOYERS SO. IT WAS A SHARED COST BETWEEN THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE BENEFITS EVERYONE DIRECTLY BENEFIT WORKERS IN TERMS OF TIME WITH THEIR LOVED ONES IT ALSO BENEFITS NOT JUST EMPLOYERS BUT SOCIETY AT LARGE IN TERMS OF ALL ALL THE BENEFITS THAT THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AND SO. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY SEE. AS A PROGRAM THAT SHOULD BE A SHARED INVESTMENT BY BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS IN THAT WE SHOULD ALL PRIORITIZE AND WERE WE TO SET A PRECEDENT NOW WITH A WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT SOME SORT OF MAJOR EXPANSION. TO JUST GO BACK TO WORKERS AND TALK ABOUT. RAISING THE THE EXISTING TAXES ON WORKERS WE THINK WOULD BE. FRANKLY PRETTY UNFAIR AND UNWISE FOR A FEW DIFFERENT REASONS ONE ISSUE IS THAT RIGHT NOW THE D. I. FUND IS -- TO OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AS A RESULT OF WHAT ARE CALLED WORKERS COMPENSATION LEANS. SO RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE WORKER YOU GET HURT ON THE JOB I AND YOU GO TO YOUR EMPLOYER IF THE EMPLOYER BELIEVES THAT THE INJURY ISN'T WORK RELATED. MOST OF THE TIME THOSE WORKERS ARE FORCED TO GO INTO THE D. I. FUND TO GET BY THEY DON'T GET THE TEMPORARY DISABILITY BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO ONE OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. AND SO THEN THE CLAIM GOES THROUGH THE SYSTEM IS FOUND THAT IT WAS WORK RELATED. THE IDEA IS THAT THE STATE THEN GOES BACK AND GETS THAT MONEY FROM EMPLOYERS INPUTS THAT BACK INTO THE AYE FUND.UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN AND SO NOW THERE'S AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT THAT SHOULD BE IN THERE. DESPITE THE FACT THAT WORKERS COMP FIFTEEN AND ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THAT THE CLIENTS GOING TO CONTINUE SO WE'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE. WORKERS COMP COSTS ARE GOING DOWN IN PART BECAUSE EMPLOYERS AREN'T PAYING THE CLAIMS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED. TO AND WORKERS ARE HAVING TO ESSENTIALLY MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS AND SO. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM WHERE -- WHEN THE WHEN THE RECESSION STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THE STATE HAD TO START BORROWING MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? THE THE LOANS GENERATE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF INTEREST HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR THAT AT THE TIME THE GENERAL FUND DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE GENERAL FUND WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE. AND SO THE MONEY WAS ESSENTIALLY LOAN FROM THE D. I. FUNDS TO THE U. I TRUST FUND TO COVER THAT COST. AND THE THE LOANS WERE NOT ENTIRELY PAID BACK SO BY MY MATH AT LEAST IT'S STILL OWED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE SECOND LOAN. AND THE THE DEEPER PROBLEM THERE'S THERE'S A REAL STRUCTURAL INSOLVENCY BUILT INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM SO IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE THE U. I TRUST FUND ENDED THE YEAR. IN IN THE POSITIVE BALANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN BANKRUPT FOR A DECADE. AND THE SECOND ANOTHER RECESSION STARTS IT'S A PRETTY SAFE BET THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO FIND SOME OTHER SOURCE TO COVER THE INTEREST ON THE FEDERAL LOANS AND THAT MAYBE THE P. I. FUND SO. HERE WE'VE GOT A SITUATION UNDER FUNDED STRUCTURALLY AS A MATTER OF COURSE BY EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS HAVE TO FUND THE DIFFERENCE OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET SO. IT'S IT IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR US TO LOOK AT THESE TWO PROGRAMS AND REALIZE THAT BECAUSE WE'VE SET ASIDE THIS MONEY. TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH IT'S A THEN KIND OF USED. TO BAIL OUT EMPLOYERS THAT DON'T PAY LEGITIMATE WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND DEAL WITH THE STRUCTURAL INSOLVENCY THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM. SO IT'S WE BELIEVE UNFAIR TO SOME DEGREE TO LOOK AT THAT FUNDING LOOK AT US AS THE PLACE TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE IN FUNDING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR AN EXPANSION. AND THIS IS ALL IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WORKER WAGES HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN STAGNANT SINCE THE MID SEVENTIES. THAT UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE NINETIETH WAGE PERCENTILE OR ABOVE YOU REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN A REYES AND FORTY OR FORTY FIVE YEARS ON AVERAGE AND SO. GOING TO THOSE WORKERS TO THAN FROM THE INCREASE IN BENEFITS IS JUST ONE MORE BURDEN THAT MOST OF US REALLY JUST CAN'T AFFORD -- AND ALSO GETTING INTO THE ISSUE OF SOLVENCY CONCERNS THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT LOWERING THE SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUND TO HELP -- THE FUND A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THE EXPANSION MIGHT COST AGAIN GIVEN THAT THE D. I. FUND IS ALREADY OWED TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY TWELVE LOAN. IT'S A LITTLE SCARY TO START THINKING ABOUT WEAKENING THAT SOLVENCY BECAUSE IT WE ESSENTIALLY JUST KIND OF PRETENDED THAT MONEY WAS THERE AS WE WERE LOANING THE MONEY OUT. AND THEY GOT THEIR SESSION DIDN'T GET MUCH WORSE BUT HAD THAT HAPPENED. NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S THE FUN TIMES SINCE IT WAS. AND SO THOSE SONGS HE REQUIREMENTS THERE IN LAW -- WERE KIND OF CREATED THROUGH A PAINFUL PROCESS OF TRIAL AND ERROR IT WASN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT THAT WAS CREATED IT WAS US REALIZING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE FUND TO COVER THESE BENEFITS AND SO WE NEEDED TO KEEP MORE IN THERE. AND SO WERE EXTREMELY CONCERNED WITH ANYTHING THAT WOULD WEAKEN THE SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS -- AS WAS MENTIONED THERE IS ALSO CONCERN WITH THE FACT THAT SO MANY WORKERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S CLEARLY IN THE LOG SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T PROTECT THEM IF THEY DO HAVE FEWER THAN TWENTY CO WORKERS. AND THEY TRY TO TAKE THE LEAVE AND AS WAS MENTIONED EMPLOYER COMPLETELY FIRE THEM. THE SAD REALITY IS THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE PROTECTED EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY CO WORKERS THAT. THIS IS A LAW THAT STUFF TO ENFORCE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF WORKERS OUT THERE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTED BUT THEY'RE WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IF THEY TAKE THIS LEAVE THEY MAY NOT GET CALLED BACK THE THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE FIRED FOR SOME OTHER. REASON AND IT'S AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THING TO PROVE THAT AND SO IT'S GOOD THAT THE LAW IS THERE BUT IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM THERE ARE MANY THAT ON THAT WOULD BE PROTECTED BY THAT. AND ONE OTHER LAST ISSUE TO RAISE IS THAT IF WE WERE TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT JUST RAISE THE WAGE REPLACEMENT BENEFITS. THAT MANY EMPLOYERS OUT THERE COORDINATE BENEFITS SO THE PROGRAM GIVES YOU YOUR 6270% OF YOUR WAGES AND THEN THE EMPLOYER WILL PAY FOR THE ADDITIONAL AND SO WERE WE TO FUND THE X. EMPLOYERS DO THAT THEN GET THE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND BASICALLY TURN AROUND AND GIVE IT TO THEIR EMPLOYERS SO IN A SENSE IT'S RAISING TAXES ON WORKERS TO THEN. JUST TURN AROUND AND HANDED OVER THE EMPLOYER AND SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT MAY CREATE SOME. HEARTBURN AMONG THOSE WORKERS THAT WOULD THEN SEE THAT PROCESS HAPPEN -- BUT THOSE ARE JUST A GENERALLY OUR MAIN PERSPECTIVES ON THE SYSTEM AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE AGAIN. THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WE VERY VERY MUCH DO SUPPORT AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE EXPANDED WE LOOK VERY MUCH FORWARD TO BEING INVOLVED IN THE TASK FORCE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE EXPANSION HAPPENS. IN IMAGE MADE MENTION OF THEM AND AND MISS KERRY MADE MENTION OF THE KIND OF FEAR THAT WORKERS HAVE. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF OF OF TAKING ANY FAMILY LEAVE -- BUT SHOULD BE XIN OF RETALIATION AND MORE PRESUMING THAT YOU AGREE THAT YOUR TELEVISION IS A PROBLEM. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THERE ANYTHING THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO? TO ENSURE THAT WICKS WORKERS TAKE FAMILY LEAVE WITHOUT FEAR OF ANY. ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION. IS ANYTHING MORE THAT WE CAN DO DO YOU THINK. WELL IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM WITHOUT IT'S A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD PROBLEM WITHOUT A STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION WHERE IT REALLY JUST COMES DOWN TO ENFORCEMENT AND TYPICALLY. THESE THINGS TAKE A VERY VERY LONG TIME THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT'S A PRETTY. PRETTY SIMPLE ONE TO DEAL WITH -- ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT STEP A STRONG UNION AND IF THEY DO HAVE ACCESS TO A SPECIALLY -- JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS IN THEIR CONTRACT THEN ONE THING THEY CAN DO IS STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHTS AND EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE THEM AND YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE ADDITIONAL LAYER OF ENFORCEMENT THERE WHERE. THE UNION CAN FILE A GRIEVANCE UNDER THAT MAKE SURE WELL ARGUE THAT JUST BECAUSE WASN'T NET AND MAKE SURE THAT THE WORD GETS THEIR JOB BACK TYPICALLY. MUCH MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN THEY DO ON OUR STATE ENFORCEMENT SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GO ABOUT IT SOME OF IT PROBABLY INVOLVES JUST A SIMPLE SOLUTION LIKE GREATER FUNDING TO ENFORCE EXISTING LAW -- IN ADDITION ENCOURAGING MORE WORKERS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO JOIN UNIONS BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET INTO THE WEEDS OF IN THIS TASK FORCE AND FIGURE OUT. HOW WE CAN DO BETTER TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR ABOUT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM A LOT OF WORKERS OUT THERE? IN IN MISCARRY TO THAT POINT I MEAN DITION TO CLARIFYING SIMPLIFYING THE RULES MAKE THEM CONSISTENT. TO THE POINT OF I THE REDUCE THE FEAR RETALIATION ARE ACTUALLY PRODUCING ACTUAL RETALIATION. OF MOBILE WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO YEAH -- I MEAN SO A LOT THAT I SEE ARE TWO THINGS ONE IS THE NOTICE BOTH TO EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES ALL THE SURVEYS I'VE SEEN IS EMPLOYEES ALWAYS REPORT THAT THE NUMBER ONE PLACE TO HEAR FROM ABOUT THE RIGHT IS FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS. EMPLOYER SIMPLY AREN'T EDUCATED ON WHAT THESE ARE AND IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS DOING THE WRONG THING OF COURSE I SEE THAT HAVE ANY EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW THE RIGHT THING BUT I'M. WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO PAID READILY VERNON'S WE DID A LOT AND WE HAD WHEN FIVE HUNDRED AND IN A WHERE WE ACTUALLY GOT ALL THESE LAWS AND PROVIDE REAL GUIDANCE AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN -- THE ENFORCEMENT GOAL MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY IN THE CITY BECAUSE OF THAT -- AND THEN WHICH I FOUND ITS ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING WHICH ENFORCES THE JOB PROTECTION AND THE ANTI RETALIATION PROVISIONS -- IF YOU FILE WHAT THEY CALL PRE COMPLAINING COREY HERE WAITING AT LEAST THREE MONTHS FOR AN INTAKE INTERVIEW TO FILE A COMPLAINT AND THEN IT'S A YEAR FROM THE FILING OF THAT COMPLAINTS. THAT YOU ANY DETERMINATION IS USUALLY REACHED -- NOW THAT I THINK IS A FUNDING PROBLEM AND STAFFING AND HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO DO IN TAKES BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM. AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF THE MEAT FIRST TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR I HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS -- IS BECAUSE ALSO. SO MY QUESTION IS DO WITH INCOME REPLACEMENT OF FIGURE -- SO I HEAR YOU AND AND SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT -- SIMPLY REPLACING INCOME AT THE BENEFIT OF AN EMPLOYER THAT NO LONGER HAS TO REPLACE THAT INCOME FOR HIGHER WAGE WORKERS BUT IS THERE A WAY -- TO INCOME REPLACEMENT BY -- BY SALARY E. R.. SO THAT WE COULD DO A 100% REPLACEMENT MAYBE FOR MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS AND AND CHAIR IT DOWN AS PEOPLE MAKE MORE SO IT'S MORE OF A LIVING WAGE REPLACEMENT. SURE I I CAN THINK OF ANY REASON WHY WE COULDN'T DO THAT OF ESPECIALLY ANSWERING THAT WE DID A VERSION OF THAT AND AB NINE AWAY SO IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT ALSO MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO TRY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHICH EMPLOYERS. COORDINATE BENEFITS AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN VERY THOROUGHLY STUDIED -- BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE MORE DATA ON WHOSE MOST AFFECTED BY THAT THAN ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS WITH THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER INCOME WORKERS THAT. THE INTENDED BENEFIT FROM THAT KIND OF EMPLOYER POLICY BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT'S THE CASE ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT EMPLOYER PROFILE LOOKS LIKE THE ONES THAT TYPICALLY DO OFFER COORDINATED BENEFITS WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL THING IN ADDITION. TO OTHER MEASURES LIKE A DISCUSSION AND I AGREE I MEAN I'VE NEVER HAD SO MUCH SUPPORT FROM LARGE EMPLOYERS FOR OF WORKER PROTECTION AS INCOME FOR EACH PLACEMENT WHICH SUGGESTS TO ME THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS GOING ON BUT I AM THAT. I AM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO IF THIS IS THE THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IT IS SUBSIDIZING LARGE EMPLOYERS WHO SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THEMSELVES -- IT IS I ATE MY OBSESSION WITH ENSURING THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT PAYING MORE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TIME OFF THERE ARE THERE ARE YOU PAID FOR IT. FOR A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS TO BE TAKING THAT TIME OFF SO -- THEIR THEIR POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS BESIDES NOT ADDRESSING THAT THE PERCENT OF THE INCOME REPLACEMENT PERCENTAGE THAT WE COULD PROBABLY FIND YOU AGREE TO THAT. ABSOLUTELY. A SIMILAR REVERSE SERGEANTS WHERE. AND AND OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT MISSING GEHRY IN TERMS OF THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY AND SOMETIMES WE HEAR IS DISRUPTIVE FOR DIFFICULT TO ACCOMMODATE. OF THESE KINDS OF THESE BUT I I BUT STUDIES SHOW THE OPPOSITE THAT COST WAY MORE UP TO FIVE TIMES MORE TO HIRE A NEW. EMPLOYEE THAN TO ACTUALLY COMPLY WITH THE LEAVE AND ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT OR IS THAT CONSISTENT. TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE ON THIS YES THE CONSISTENT WITH ALL THIS THEIR ABC SEEN SENSE FMLA WENT INTO A FACT YOU KNOW WHICH IS A FEDERAL LAW PROVIDING FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS UNPROTECTED. JOB PREDICTED UNPAID LEAVE SORRY -- AND ALSO THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING REPORTED THAT IT'S HAD EITHER POSITIVE OR NO EFFECT ON EMPLOYERS -- PROVIDING THIS LEAVE AMAZING AT IMMEDIATE GUT REACTION THAT THIS CAN'T BE DONE BUT WE SEE IT HAPPENING ALL THE TIME AND YOU KNOW IN SAN FRANCISCO WE ALSO AS PART OF MY WORK I HELPED LEAD THE HEALTHY MOTHERS WORKPLACE COALITION. WHICH AWARDS EMPLOYERS -- AWARDS EVERY YEAR FOR VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTING FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE POLICIES AND WE HAVE A GOLD AWARD WINNERS AND MANY THAT ARE SMALL EMPLOYERS. THAT ARE PROVIDING UP TO SIX MONTHS OF LEAVE AND THEY'RE GETTING IT DONE -- WE KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE WE WE SUPPORTED AND YOU KNOW ALSO IN CALIFORNIA WHICH I THINK MANY PEOPLE FORGET AS WE WE DO HAVE PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE LAW WHICH ACTUALLY APPLIES TO ALL EMPLOYERS WITH AT LEAST FIVE EMPLOYEES. AND PROVIDE THAT AS LONG AS EMPLOYERS FIVE EMPLOYEES YOU MUST PROVIDE UP TO FOUR MONTHS OF JOB PROTECTED BUT ON PAID TIME OFF. WHILE YOU'RE CONSIDERED DISABLED BY PREGNANCY CHILDBIRTH OR RELATED CONDITION THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE SEVENTIES AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A THRIVING ECONOMY SELF. I THINK IT'S PLAYED HELP THAT THIS KIND. IT IS A BENEFIT ACTUALLY TO EMPLOYERS THANK YOU THE DOCTOR CHAN'S -- YOU'D MENTION ONE THING ABOUT. THE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. THE PAY THE BONTA PERCENT AND AND TO THAT POINT MEAN WHETHER SIXTY OR SEVENTY WEATHER'S. HUNDRED THAT I SIXTY OR 70% YOU STILL HAVE THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE. THAT LEADS TO OTHER. KIND OF ISSUES TRAUMA OR JUST CHALLENGES -- WHY PEOPLE DON'T TAKE LEAVE IT ALL SO THE DIFFERENCE IS 63% AND NOT TAKING LEAVE IT ALL WHICH IS WHERE THEY KEEP UNDER PERCENT -- AND AND AND YOU MENTIONED THE POST PARTUM DEPRESSION. AND WE HAD OF UNFORTUNATE CASE RELATIVELY RECENTLY IN SAN JOSE WHERE A MOTHER KILLED HER. THERE ARE TWO YOUNG BOYS INNER SELF AND BUT WAS LINKED TO POST PARTUM DEPRESSION AND SHE WAS SHE WORKED EN EL SALON AND WAS THE PRIMARY BREADWINNER. AND I CAN OF ALWAYS. THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT ACTING WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING CARE OF THE YOUNG PARENTS YOUNG MOTHERS. TAKING CARE OF THESE CHILDREN AND I JUST YOU KNOW WHAT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT IT JUST KIND OF JOG MY MEMORY OF IT -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S ANECDOTAL BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT MAY NOT BE THE END RESULT YOU KNOW THE THE TRAGEDY IN THAT CASE BUT IT DOES CAUSE TRAUMA. A IN SOME CASES WITH YOUNG MOTHERS AND CAUSES TRAUMA BUT THE CHILDREN OF THEY'RE NOT WITH THEIR PARENTS -- WE SO MEAN AGAIN WE SEE AN EXTREME EXTREME CASES OF THAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER. AS WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SEPARATE A CHILD -- FORCING A PERIOD TIME BUT I IMAGINE THAT ON A SMALLER LESS -- SEVERE SCALE BUT THAT SEPARATION AT A VERY YOUNG AGE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME LONG PERIODS OF THE DAY. I IMAGINE WOULD HAVE SOME LONG LASTING IMPACTS IN TERMS THE CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT. YEAH I'VE I'D REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR SENTIMENTS AND THAT'S WHY I HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS ARE SO SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL -- THIS IS THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN WORKING CONDITIONS. INCOME AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE MOST CRITICAL PERIOD OF LIFE THERE'S NO OTHER POLICY THAT'S LIKE THIS AND THERE'S NO INEQUITY THE UNITED STATES. THAT AS DISPARATE AS WHAT I SEE IN MY PEDIATRIC CLINIC RIGHT NOW WE HAVE HIGH WAGE EARNERS WHO ARE ABLE TO TAKE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS TO PAY PARENTAL LEAVE. AND THERE'S SOME LOW WAGE. WORKERS WHO FEEL PRESSURE TO GO BACK TO WORK IMMEDIATELY AND DO NEED TO GO BACK TO YOU IMMEDIATELY WHEN I LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SIXTY BABY WHO NEEDS TO GO. TO INFORMAL DAYCARE A SIX WEEK. A SIXTY BABY SIX WITH BABY IS SIX MONTHS EQUITY STARTS AND THIS IS WHY SO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE READY. TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT RIGHT NOW FOR A PARENTAL LEAVE SO THANK YOU FOR ELEMENTS THOUGHT THAT WAY I I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PASS ON THIS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZING. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS -- SO WE HAVE SOME TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE -- TO COME ON UP AND I WANT TO THANK OUR PANELISTS HERE -- BOTH THE PANELS. OF FRESH GETTING US AND AND OFFERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS AND IF UP PALACE IF YOU CAN -- OFFER COMMENTS FOR A MINUTE OR LESS I I'D APPRECIATE THAT. AND YEAH.

THANK YOU. HI ALEX TO CAPRI ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROPOSAL AND BECAUSE PAVE AT PARENTAL LEAVE IS NOT A LUXURY IT'S AMERICA -- MAJOR BIOLOGICAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BENEFIT FOR EACH CHILD AND RESEARCH MAKES IT CLEAR THE FIRST MONTHS AND YEARS ARE CRITICAL TO MY SUCCESS. AND OVER 80% OF A CHILD'S BRAIN DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS AND FREQUENT NURTURING PARENT CHILD INTERACTIONS ARE KEY TO STRONG BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND THE FIRST THREE MONTHS -- SO WORKING PARENTS MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEND THE FIRST MONTHS OF EACH CHILD'S LIFE ESTABLISHING A FOUNDATION FOR EACH CHILD SUCCESS -- AND NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE WELL BEING OF THEIR NEW CHILD AND THEIR FAMILIES FINANCIAL SECURITY AND IS THE FIRST BY SUPPLIED THE GOVERNOR'S -- LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS A BUDGET PROGRESSES THANK YOU THANK YOU.

THAT WE STILL HAVE THAT PART OF HOW WE REALLY MAKE THIS WORK FOR EVERYBODY SO WE'RE NOT JUST MOVING FORWARD FOR ONE SECTION. AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS LEFT BEHIND SO THAT REALLY IS SHOP PROTECTION IT'S NOT IT'S WAITED PLACEMENT BUT IT'S ALSO JOB PROTECTION.
