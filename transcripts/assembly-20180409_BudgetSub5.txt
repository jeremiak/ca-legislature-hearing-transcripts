AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WEBER MEMBERS. AYE MARCHING HOSHINO WITH THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL COUNCIL I HAVE WITH ME. THE HONORABLE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE LA SUPERIOR COURT A DAN BUCKLEY. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME INTRODUCE YOU THANK YOU. AND WE CAME HERE THIS. AVENUE WHERE YOU BEGAN I'M NOT ESTABLISH QUORUM. AND THEY WILL LET YOU CONTINUE WITH WOMEN GET WE GOT TO DO IT OKAY ABSOLUTELY. US SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL PLEASE A WEBER HERE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY CARE MELENDEZ. STONE. THANK YOU NOT COMMITTING TO HELP ME PROVIDE THIS PRETTY. RESPECTIVE I THINK THE FIRST THING I WILL BE BRIEF. OWING TO THE THE THE CHALLENGES OF THE OF THE OF THE. CLOCK. DOCTOR WEBER BUTLER IN THE OVER ARCHING THEME I THINK A PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO PROVIDE IS AT THE BUDGET AS IT IS PROPOSED. REALLY REFLECTS WHAT WE FEEL IS A CONSENSUS PRIORITY AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE CHIEF JUSTICE HERSELF AS WELL AS USUAL COUNSEL. A AS WELL AS OUR TRIAL COURTS IN NAMELY IT IS THAT THIS BUDGET REALLY REFLECTS OUR TOP PRIORITY UNITS A CONSENSUS PRIORITY. OF WHICH IS THAT IT PROVIDES NEW FUNDING FOR THE BASE OPERATIONS FROM A TRIAL COURTS AND NOT JUST NEW FUNDING BUT EXPAND. AND OR CREATE NEW TYPES OF SELF HELP SERVICES WHICH WILL ADDRESS WHAT IS REALLY THE FASTEST GROWING PUBLIC NEED. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN OUR COURTS IN CALIFORNIA THE SECOND COMPONENT A IS APPROXIMATELY FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. TO FURTHER THE EFFORT TO EQUALIZE FUNDING AMONG OUR INDIVIDUAL TRIAL COURTS AND WE ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT THAT PROPOSAL WOULD BENEFIT ABOUT THIRTY FOUR. OF OUR MOST SEVERELY UNDER UNDER FUNDED THE COURTS. BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK MEMBERS BECAME AWARE OF THAT WE WERE IN THE FIFTH AND FINAL AND MOST DIFFICULT YEAR OF A FIVE YEAR PROJECT. AT THE COURT SYSTEM INITIATED WHICH WAS TO SHIFT MONEY FROM SOME COURTS TO OTHER COURTS THAT WERE SO SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED AND LAST YEAR WAS A DIFFICULT YEAR IN FACT IT'S THE CURRENT YEAR FOR US IS A DIFFICULT YEAR BECAUSE WE DID SO ABSENT NEW FUNDING. AND SO THIS IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT THIS YEAR TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ADVANCE THE EQUALIZATION OF FUNDING BUT TO DO SO WITH NEW RESOURCES BUT WHICH WE THINK WILL BE INCREDIBLY ADVANTAGES TO ALL COURTS IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN LASTLY. THE THIRD COMPONENT LA IS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. THAT WAY LAW AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOUGH IT'S NOT QUITE A COMPLETE OVERLAP IT WOULDN'T BE A TOTAL ARE COMPLETE SOLAR OR LUNAR ECLIPSE. BUT THERE IS NOT A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRIORITIES OF OUR CHIEF JUSTICES THAT YOU JUST OR AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS WELL AS OUR IS A TRIAL COURT'S. AND SO WITH THAT I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW OUR VIEW OUR SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSAL. A AND WE HOPE AS YOU WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH YOUR DELIBERATIONS YOU WILL SEE THAT IT WILL HELP. OUR COURTS HELP WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LAW. CENTER THE TOTAL LEVEL OF FUN I WOULD LIKE TO BY THE RELATIVE TO ITS GENERAL FUND SPENDING PRIORITIES. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT TO WHATEVER ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS PROVIDED BE PROVIDED BASED ON LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SUCH AS THAT THAT ARE SPECIFIED TOUCHES PROGRAMS OR SERVICES OR A COLA ADJUSTMENT WHAT WOULD BE IT. RATHER THAN ALLOWING JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AT THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR HOW SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE AUGMENTATION WOULD BE SPENT BECAUSE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WOULD HAVE COMPLETE FLEXIBILITY AND USING THOSE FUNDS. SO THE FUNDS COULD BE ALLOCATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL TRIAL COURTS ON WALL FROM AS HAS BEEN DONE PREVIOUSLY. OR IT COULD BE USED TO TO FIND FUTURES COMMISSIONS RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MENTIONED. HOWEVER IT WITHOUT COSTS AND BENEFITS FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY AND TO WHAT EXTENT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO WEIGH IN ON SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. IN REGARDS TO THE EQUALIZATION FUNDING. EQUALIZATION CAN OCCUR IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE CAN SPECIFY HOW THEY WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. FINALLY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS CURRENT WORKLOAD BASED METHODOLOGY ACCURATELY ESTIMATES TRIAL COURTNEY. AND SO WE DO RECOMMEND. CONVENING A WORKING GROUP TO EVALUATE THE METHODOLOGY AND OFFER POTENTIAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGE BY NOVEMBER FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AN ACCURATE FORMULA WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE THE TOTAL LEVEL A FUNDING TO PROVIDE TO THE TRIAL COURT'S ANNUALLY. AS WELL AS HOW TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT TRIAL COURTS AND MEET LEGISLATIVELY DESIRED SERVICE LEVELS. OKAY LIAM. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. COULD YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND. WOULD BASICALLY JUST ASKED TO GIVE A SURE. QUIZZES XIN OF JUNE FAVOR ARE OPPOSED TO THE RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION CONTAIN THANK YOU DOCTOR.

THE BACKLOGS THAT MANY COURTS FACED IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO ADDRESS THOSE THROUGH ADDING ADDITIONAL JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE COURT CLERKS AND OTHERS. WHO CAN HELP GET THROUGH THOSE BACKLOGS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE? GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAUREN CLIMB AND WITH THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT NEARLY ONE HUNDRED LEGAL AID NON PROFITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME ACCESSING THE COURTS WHETHER IT'S LACK OF COURT REPORTERS CLOSED HOURS AND PROVIDING RESOURCES TO THE COURTS ALLOWS THEM TO OPEN.

BLITZER. OKAY MUNJAL. REAL SIMPLE JUST KIND OF A CLARIFYING QUESTION. WE'RE TALK ABOUT THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FLEXIBILITY AS PROPOSED. WHO SPECIFICALLY WOULD DETERMINE HOW THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE DISPERSED? WELL AS IT STANDS NOW AS WITH ALL ALLOCATIONS IN THE BRANCH THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS AS IS INFORMED THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES AND THE TRIAL COURT LEADERSHIP. ACTUALLY HAS A LARGE SET OF COMMITTEES THAT WILL WORK UP RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN SUGGEST TO IT NOT UNLIKE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS HERE AND THEN MAKE AN ALLOCATION SO. I IF I'M EXPLAINING IT WELL ENOUGH IT WILL BE THE COUNCIL BUT THAT DECISION IS SO WELL INFORMED BY A LOT OF PARTICIPATION ON THE LOWER COMMITTEES IN TRIAL COURT MEMBERSHIP. THAT IT'S ALMOST AS IF THERE IS A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE HOW MANY PEOPLE ON THIS GALGIANI THERE ARE TWENTY ONE VOTING MEMBERS. ALONG WITH AN EIGHTY GIVE THE TIME EIGHT TO NINE ADVISORY MEMBERS. I AND THEN THERE ARE SOME LOWER COMMITTEES OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT A KEY COMMITTEES WHAT WE CALL OUR TRIAL COURT BUDGET ADVISORY COMMITTEE WELL QUALIFIED TO BEAR ON THE COUNCIL. I IT'S COMPRISES A CONSTITUTIONALLY CREATED BODY AND SO IT IS CHAIRED BY IS IT MADE OF WHAT IS THAT'S OUR AS IT GVES YOU AS IF I HAD THE SENATE CHIEF JUSTICE IS THE CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL IT HAS SOME SUPREME COURT A SUPREME COURT MEMBER. AND THEN ALSO HAS SOME ASSOCIATE COURTS OF APPEAL JUSTICES HAVE CELL AND TRIAL COURT. JUDGES THAT ARE PART OF IT IT HAS TWO MEMBERS FROM THE LEGISLATURE ONE FROM THE ASSEMBLY. AND ONE FROM THE SENATE AND THEN FOR MEMBERS FROM THE STATE BAR. OKAY THANK YOU IT'S VERY HELPFUL. OKAY MISSPELL. THANK YOU THIS IS A I THINK A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT. OUR ROLE AND TALK ABOUT THAT THAT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND. I AM ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT OF ENSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING EXTRA MONEY DOWN AND SPECIAL TO THE TRIAL COURT'SBUT IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH. THE FUTURES COMMISSION AND THINGS THAT ARE PRIORITIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TWO OF WHICH I WOULD JUST LIKE TO PUT ON THIS COMMITTEES RIGHT ARE MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT I WOULD. ASK US TO CONSIDER THEM. AND ONE OF WHICH IS TESTING A A ONE COURT PILOT FOR COMBINING. DODD JUVENILE COURTS TOGETHER IN A LARGER SENSE THERE'S SOME SMALL COUNTIES THAT HAVE COME BY JUVENILE COURTS BUT. IF WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT LARGER COUNTIES SANTA CLARA ACTUALLY HAS BEEN WORKING ALONG. THIS LINE BUT. THIS WOULD THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN LOOKED AT BY THE BY THE LEGISLATURE THE JUDICIAL. JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PUBLIC SAFETY AND HUMAN SERVICES HAD A JOINT HEARING TO LOOK A COMBINING THESE TWO. AREAS WE TEND TO DO SO MUCH. DECISIONS REALLY IN TWO VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT. DUAL SYSTEM AND THAT DEPENDENCY SYSTEM AND NICK IF WORKING WITH THE COURTS IN THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION COMMANDED FUTURES COMMISSION. WE GOT HOW WE DO A BETTER SYSTEM FOR KIDS AT RISK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD BE THAT MUCH I DON'T HOW MUCH OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT. AND THEN THE OTHERS ALSO FEATURES COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION THAT COMES OUT OF A PROJECT IT'S BEEN BEEN WORKING IN IN FRESNO WHERE THERE ARE. CHILD CUSTODY DECISIONS THAT DON'T INVOLVE ABUSE. AND THEY PROVIDED REAL MEDIATION THAT IS MEDIATION WITHOUT MAKING A RECOMMENDATION THAT THEN SUCH INTERFERES WITH THE PARTIES ABILITY TO TO COME TO A REAL AGREEMENT. AGAIN RECOMMENDED BY THE FUTURES COMMISSION I THINK THAT'S ON THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND IF WE CAN PRIORITIZE AT LEAST THOSE TWO. AREAS WE WOULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB PROTECTING KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY I WANT TO THANK YOU OFFER THAT ONE OF THE CONCERNS I THINK WE HAVE AS A COMMITTEE AND. AND I'VE HAD A. NUMBER OF PERSONS TO CALL IN EXPRESS A CONCERN NOT NOT ABOUT THE AMOUNTS THAT WE PUT OUT THERE YOU KNOW UP AND SEVEN FIVE MILLION IS OBVIOUSLY. WARRANTED AND PROBABLY EVEN MORE IN TERMS OF WHAT WHERE HOW FAR WE NEED TO GO TO COURT. BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES AS WE KEEP ASKING WHAT ARE THE REAL PRIORITIES THAT ARE GOING TO DRIVE THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. YOU KNOW A WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF ISSUES HERE AND AND AT THIS AT OUR LEVEL WITH REGARDS TO. THE pNOT. WE DON'T KNOW IF IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF TIME ALONG IT TAKES A PERSON TO GET THE COURT. OF THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT APPEAR BECAUSE WE HEAR THAT A LOT FOR MY MEMBERS. OF SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE THINGS AS MRS STONE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE CAR SUPPORT RESTRUCTURING ORGANIZATION. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND SO YOU KNOW WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT AS WE. WE LISTEN AND WE HEAR THAT. THAT THERE THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN THE AND THE COURTS THEMSELVES ARE ALL WALKING AND TALKING PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME DIRECTION. BUT YET I HEAR LITTLE DISSIDENTS WHEN I HEAR THEM SAY BUT WE WANT TO CONTROL WHAT WE DO WITH THE MONEY. UP BECAUSE IT TO IT IF THAT'S THE CASE AND WE COULD PROBABLY A FIGURE OUT THE. THE FORMULA AND ALLOCATED DIRECTLY TO THE COURTS AND BYPASS THE COUNCIL COMPLETELY AND END UP GIVING IT TO THE COURTS THEMSELVES. AND NOT DEAL WITH THE COUNCIL IF IF IF EVERYBODY'S WALKING AND TALKING IN THE SAME DIRECTION MAYBE THEY ARE MAYBE THEY ARE. BUT IF THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE COURTS IN THE DUST SO THEN THE DISCRETION BECOMES THEIR DISCRETION. BUT I THINK WE'VE LEARNED FROM. PLEASE I'VE LEARNED FROM LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR SCHOOLS. THAT WITHOUT CLEAR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND AND EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL LOOK LIKE. YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT YOU WANT IN THE END AND SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE BETTER SIR. OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA HOW SO I THINK WE'VE ASKED A COUPLE TIMES WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES OF OF THE OF THE OF THE OF THE OF COURTS. WITH REGARDS TO. TO GIVE SOME AT LEAST SOME FRAMEWORK IN GUIDELINE AS TO HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN. A IF IT'S A MATTER OF BOOK FORMULA WITH REGARDS TO ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES CAN WE ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT. COUNTIES OF QUARTZ I GUESS HAVING. AT LEAST WHAT THEY CONSIDER A FAIR ALLOCATION BASED ON THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE IN THE COURTS OF A HAT. SO I DON'T HAVE A. A SENSE OF THAT. AT THIS TIME AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE JUST GIVE THE FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE. MILLION IN ONE DIRECTION WHAT WE GIVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WITH A LIST OF PRIORITIES FROM THIS FROM THIS BODY. OF OR WHETHER WE DECIDE THAT. THIS IF WE'RE GONNA DO DISCRETION AND EVERYBODY BELIEVES THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE DISCRETION WHETHER THAT WE ACTUALLY ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES TO THE VARIOUS COURTS. OF THE FIFTY COURTS AND ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THE DISCRETION AS TO HOW THEY WOULD MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD TO JUSTICE AND SERVICE FOR THE PEOPLE. OF CALIFORNIA SO THOSE OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT'S RUNNING THROUGH MY MIND THAT I'VE KEEP LOOKING FOR AND HOPING TO FIND. AND I SUMA FIND IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. A SEMI HELP ME FIND IN TERMS OF THE PRIORITIES THAT ARE SET BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US AT THIS LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE BEGINNING TO CHIP AWAY AT THE PROBLEMS AND CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT A WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COURTS AND YOU KNOW NOT THAT THEY'VE CREATED A PROBLEM WE CREATED THEM WITH THE LACK OF RESOURCES WE UNDERSTAND THAT. AND. AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT LISA MOVING IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE WANT TO GO. SO THAT TO THEIR SOME FAIRNESS ACROSS THE BOARD NOT ONLY MONTH WITH THE JUDGES EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE STAFFING IS AND HOW. AND AND GIVE ME TO SOME THE BACKLOG THAT I HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE TERM STAFF THERE'S A LOT OF BACKLOGS WHICH MEANS ME A LOT OF FOLKS PROCESSING STUFF. A EARLY ON IN AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO. SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF PRIORITIES IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ITEM AND YOU KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BASED ON THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE'VE HAD COMING TO US. AS LEGISLATORS. YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD YES DOCTOR WEBER IF I COULD AT LEAST LEAVE YOU. AND YOUR MEMBERS WITH THIS IMPRESSION THE LIST OF THINGS THAT YOU JUST CITED. ARE THE SAME THINGS THAT WE HEAR THE SAME THING THAT EVERY PRESIDING JUDGE IN THE SYSTEM HERE'S AND SO AGAIN I THINK THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF OVERLAP ON HOW. OF THESE PRIORITIES WHO CAN GET TEASED OUT AND AIRED OUT I DO THINK WE CAN WORK WITH YOU TO. ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR AN ARTICLE IN THAT BLANK SO THAT THIS BODY HAS. YOU KNOW OF A REASONABLE STRONG LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE APPROPRIATION THAT IT MAKES WILL BE ALLOCATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR COLLECTIVE PRIORITIES. GOING FORWARD IT WILL ADDRESS MANY OF THINGS THAT YOU JUST ARTICULATE FOUNDER LESS AND I BELIEVE THAT WILL HAPPEN I MEAN I I'VE TALKED WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND AND. WE SHARE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS FOR FAMILY COURT AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND WE ALLOCATE RESOURCES IN THE PAST BASED ON THE CONVERSATION IS THERE. SO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T AND OURSELVES YOU'RE THINKING WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS WIN IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN WE HAVE FOLKS STILL WAITING TO GET JUSTICE AND. AND WE THOUGHT WELL WE SHOULD HAVE PUT MORE OVER HERE VERSUS THERE BUT I THINK THERE ARE SIMILARITIES WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE TALKING THE SAME LANGUAGE. OKAY DOT DOT ORG ON ME YEAH WERE GIVEN THE PRIORITIES I AGREE WITH MR SHINO. ON AS A PRESIDING JUDGE WAS NOT MY HEAD WITH ALL THOSE PRIORITIES AND I'M HERE WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WILL BE A FAIR ALLOCATION NOT ONLY TO MY CORPORATE ALL OTHER FIFTY SEVEN COURTS. ALL THE PRESIDING JUDGES ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS AND AND BELIEVE THE RIGHT PRIORITIES WE MET IN THE RIGHT ALLOCATION WILL BE DONE DON'T GOOD SOUNDS GREAT THANK YOU ALL BE HELD OPEN. WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO ISSUE TO THE PILOT PROJECT WELL ONLINE ADJUDICATION OF TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WEBER AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS LOT KOPITAR* ON THE BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND I HAVE HERE WITH ME IS THE DIRECTOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES AYE SHELLEY CURRAN WHO WILL WALK YOU THROUGH THE ISSUE NUMBER TWO REGARDING THE PILOT PROJECT FOR. ONLINE ADJUDICATION OF TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS VERY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AS LUCK ASSEMBLYMAN SHELLEY CURRAN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. OF THE BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND. ALLOCATION. AND SEVEN POSITIONS FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND SEVEN POSITIONS I'M GOING TO DESIGN DEPLOY AND MAINTAIN SOFTWARE TO ADJUDICATE A TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS ON LINE AND DESIGNATED PILOT COURTS. IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR. THIRD CHIEF JUSTICE RECEIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE FUTURES COMMISSION. WOULD SET FORTH LEGAL AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES FOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE. OF THE PUBLIC GOING FORWARD ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE CHIEF FAST UMP TO MOVE FORWARD ON QUICKLY WAS. RELATES TO CIVIL ADJUDICATION OF TRAFFIC MATTERS. AN ONLINE ADJUDICATION OF THESE MATTERS ALSO. A WORK GROUP IS MEETING REGULARLY AND TO DEVELOP A FULL PROPOSAL. WE WILL BE HAVING AYE A MEETING AT THE END OF THIS MONTH ACTUALLY WOBBLE WE WHERE WE WILL BE RECEIVING. A PUBLIC COMMENT. AND PUBLIC INPUT ON TO THAT PROPOSAL. UP THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS REALLY A FIRST UP ANNA IN MOVING TOWARDS A FUTURES COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ON BY SPECIFICALLY ALLOWING FOR THE ONLINE ADJUDICATION OF TRAFFIC MATTERS. AND BY FACILITATING TRIALS BY WRITTEN DECLARATION WITHOUT THE FULL DEPOSIT OF BAIL THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW. AMID ALSO WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL THE NOBLE. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL ALSO FACILITATES I'M A PRICE OF JUSTICE AWARD THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RECEIVED ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTEEN. FROM THE YOU'D US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT IT WILL ALLOW US TO REDUCE SOME MANDATORY FINES AND FEES THAT ARE UNDER IT IT VETERAN EXISTING LAW. ON IT'LL PROVIDE FOR THE ELECTRONIC VERIFICATIONS OF A PERSON'S RECEIPT OF PUBLIC BENEFITS WITH THE CONSUMER'S CONSENT. AND IT WILL AUTOMATE THE ABILITY TO PAY. SO WE WERE ONE OF FIVE OF FIVE STATE COURT SYSTEMS THAT THAT RECEIVE THAT THAT OUR AWARD NATIONALLY. AND FIVE PILOT FIVE COURTS HAVE STEPPED UP ANNA AND AGREED TO SERVE AS PILOTS. IN THIS IN THIS OP PROJECT TULARE JUST US IN FRANCISCO VENTURA AND SANTA CLARA. OTHER COUNCIL HAS SELECTED A BITTER THROUGH COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS TO DEVELOP A TOOL. TO FOR THE ONLINE EDUCATION UP PARDON ME FOR THE ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION AND. IS WE ARE IN THE PROCESS NOW OF DEVELOPING THAT WILL WITH THEM. WORKING WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. TO CREATE A LINK FOR A CONSUMER TO OPT INTO TO CONFIRM RECEIPT OF. PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND THERE WERE ALSO PROVIDING INPUT ON INFORMATION FROM DEFENDANTS ON WHO ARE NOT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE RECIPIENTS. OF THE THE PILOTS AND THE VENDOR HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TO DATE A COURTS ARE FINALIZING THE DATA THAT WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE INDIGENTS. AND THE DATA USED BY THE SYSTEM TO TO GENERATE A REDUCTION RECOMMENDATION THAT WILL GO BEFORE THE JUDGE. FOR EXAM THEY'RE THEY'RE ALSO MAKING DETERMINATIONS RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE AND FOR EXAMPLE. OUR PILOTS NOW HAVE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THEY WILL REDUCE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE RECIPIENTS BETWEEN FIFTY AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF A OF A TRAFFIC FINER FEE. THE FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSAL ITSELF WILL ALLOW US TO BRING ON THREE ADDITIONAL PILOTS IT'LL PROVIDE FOR THE SEVEN JUDICIAL COUNCIL STAFF THAT THAT WE. EXPECT WILL TAKE OVER THE. THE TOOL ONCE A TOOL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. AND IT WILL ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT CHAT BUT A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY FOR CONSUMERS AS THEY ARE ADJUDICATING THESE MATTERS ONLINE. AND IT WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT EVALUATION WILL WILL INCLUDE. WHAT DETERMINATIONS WERE MADE WHAT THE IMPACT WAS? DEMOGRAPHICS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THE TOOL SELECTION HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHO IS USING THE TOOL. I'M AND WHAT THE IMPACT IS GENERALLY ON CONSUMERS. IN A NUTSHELL THE PRICE OF THE WAY THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS IS THE PRICE OF JUSTICE GRANT COM. I THE PROOF PROOF OF CONCEPT. THIS BCP IS THE PRODUCTION PILOT HOME WITH ONGOING SUPPORT. IT WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT GAP ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT PROBLEMS THERE MIGHT BE SO WE CAN RESOLVE THEM BEFORE I AM. THE PROJECT GOES STATEWIDE BECAUSE WE IT IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THAT THE PROJECT WILL GO STATEWIDE. ANY COMMENTS FROM. FINANCE. YES WE BELIEVE THIS PROTEST PILOT PROGRAM WILL HELP EXPLORATORIUM OPTION WHICH WILL BE CONVENIENT NOT ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS UTILIZING THE COURT SYSTEM BUT ALSO FOR THE COURTS THEMSELVES. IN THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY TYPE OF CASE. IN ADDITION IT BUILDS AND EXPANDS UPON MANY OF THE EFFORTS WHICH MAKES MISS CURRENT TOUCHED UPON THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AUTHORITY UNDERTAKEN. FOR EXPLORING BETTER MEANS OF DETERMINING AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO PAY TO PAY THEIR FINES AND FEES. AND WE DO KNOW THAT COMMITTEE STAFF THE OHIO AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE SHARED A LOT OF THOUGHTFUL INPUT FROM THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS ITEM. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PUBLIC WORKS OKAY. ANY COMMENTS LA JOH. AS NOTED THE BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES A THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ARE OFTEN AUGMENTATION TWO MILLION OF THAT IS ONE TIME AND ONE POINT FOUR IS ONGOING. WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING THE REQUEST BUT FOR THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ONLY PROVIDING THAT ON A FOUR YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE FIND THAT IT IS PREMATURE TO PROVIDE ONGOING RESOURCES BEFORE A PILOT IS COMPLETE AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS WHETHER IT SHOULD BE CONTINUED. ON INTO THE FUTURE. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE OR MODIFY THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN AT LEAST TWO WAYS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE. RECEIVES THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THE PILOT. THE FIRST AS MENTIONS ON APPROXIMATELY EIGHT COURTS ARE ESTIMATED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PILOT. WE RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT EACH OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES INCLUDE IN THE PILOT BE TESTED AT A MINIMUM OF THREE QUARTS. RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE PILOT COURTS TO CHOOSE WHICH ACTIVITIES THEY WANT TO TEST BECAUSE THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT EACH OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE TESTED IN A COURT AND THEY'RE TESTED AT COURTS WITH DIFFERENT SYSTEMS PROPHECIES AND COURT USERS. SECOND WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL BE REQUIRED TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSED PILOT AND PROVIDE A REPORT BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WELL THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE CURRENTLY DOES REQUIRE A REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PILOT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR AN EVALUATION AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT ANY TYPE OF SPECIFIC TYPE OF INFORMATION. AND SO WITHOUT IN OF VALUATION THAT COMPLETELY CLEARLY COMPARES THE PILOT SYSTEM TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM IT WILL LIKELY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO FULLY ASSESS THE PILOT AND DETERMINE WHAT COMPONENTS IF ANY. SHOULD BE CONTINUED EXPANDED OR MODIFIED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE IN ONE IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL. JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE IN FAVOR OF IT. MADAM CHAIR HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MAGGIE SCHALLER AND I'M WITH THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AS A PART OF OUR ADVOCACY WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HIGH COST TRAFFIC TICKETS ON LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AS YOU MAY KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST TRAFFIC FINES AND FEES IN THE COUNTRY AND MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS CANNOT FORD AFFORD AN UNEXPECTED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR EXPENSE. WHICH IS THE COST OF ONE RED LIGHT TICKET IN CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS. ATTENTION TO THIS AND COMMITMENT TO SOLVING THE DILEMMA HOWEVER IT'S FIVE COUNTY PILOT PROPOSAL IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO FIX THE PROBLEM. FIRST IT WOULD ONLY COVER. FIVE AND POSSIBLY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE FIVE COUNTIES. THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN WORKING TO REDUCE TRAFFIC FINES AND FEES FOR SIX YEARS AND CALIFORNIA'S PREVIOUSLY DONE A STATEWIDE AMNESTY PROGRAM. TO RETURN WITH WITH A FIVE COUNTY PIE THAT WOULD BE A STEP BACKWARD I'M SECOND THE PILOT PROVIDES NO STANDARDS FOR FINES AND FEES REDUCTIONS IT'S THE LEGISLATURE'S JOB TO SET FAIR FINES AND FEES IN THIS PILOT WOULD GIVE. TOTAL DISCRETION TO THE COURTS TO SET THE FINES WITH NO GUIDELINES TO CREATE. A EQUITY AND FINES AND FEES ACROSS COUNTIES WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO REDUCE EXISTING AND FUTURE TRAFFIC THAT BY EIGHTY PERCENT FOR ALL LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WITH THINK WITH MONTHLY PAYMENT PLANS WITH PAYMENTS NO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF A PERSON'S INCOME. AND REQUIRING COURTS TO RICK TO REINSTATE SUSPENDED LICENSE ONCE A PERSON MAKES A COURT APPEARANCE. FINALLY WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE OFTEN A LIFE CHANGING ONE FOR MANY MOST IN NEED. AND CREATING A STATEWIDE STANDARD WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THIS MATTER. THANK YOU I ASSUME THAT'S IT IN FAVOR STATEMENT OR NOT. OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRWOMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BERNIE STONECIPHER AND WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER NUMBER FOR FORUMS ON THIS ISSUE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE HAD AN AMNESTY PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHOSE LICENSES WERE SUSPENDED FOR AN ABILITY TO PAY TICKETS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE WHO JUST COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN TICKETS. SO WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE. EDUCATIONS IN TRAFFIC COURT MORE CONVENIENT BY MOVING THEM ONLINE BUT WE'RE CONCERNS THAT HAVING JUST A PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE EXISTING LANGUAGE WOULD STOP PROGRESS OVERTHE NEXT THREE YEARS FLASHY RESIGN AND TO LICENSE SUSPENSIONS FOR FAILURES TO PAY BUT THERE ARE STILL. MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THESE TICKETS AND IN PARTICULAR MY ORGANIZATION IS CONCERNED WITH PEOPLE COMING HOME FROM JAIL OR PRISON. WHO RD SUFFER FROM HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT INTENT THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER CLINIC? SEVENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME TO THAT CLINIC ARE UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE WHO HAD ONLY MET YES. SO WE WOULD WANT TO SEE IDEALLY THIS LANGUAGE INCLUDES STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR EIGHTY PERCENT REDUCTION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INDIGENT CD DON'T HAVE THIS VARIATION ACROSS COURTS IN BETWEEN. JUDGES IN A SINGLE COUNTY. AND IF ONLY IN THE PILOT PROGRAM WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL THE PARTICIPATING PILOTS INCLUDE THE SPECIFIC REDUCTIONS FOR. EIGHTY PERCENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AN AGENT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WEBER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS WAY TO ASK YOU ON THE MANAGING ATTORNEY LEGAL SERVICES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. LIKE TO REITERATE IN A FIRM WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRESENTS FOR CHILDREN LEADERS. ARE IN THE LEGAL COMMITTEE JUST SUBMITTED A WHILE GENERALLY WE ARE IN FAVOR OF MAKING COURT THROUGH AN ONLINE EDUCATION PROCESS OR OTHERWISE MORE CONVENIENT FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS. I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR ANY TRAFFIC COURT RELATED LEGISLATION INCLUDING THIS ONLINE A PROPOSAL TO CLARIFY THE DRIVER'S LICENSE HOLD FOR FAILURE TO APPEAR. BE LIFTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER A PERSON MAKE AN APPEARANCE IN COURT BY. ANY NUMBER OF MEANS AND CLARIFY WHAT DOES MEANS OF APPEARANCE ARE. SO OUR OFFICES. BOTH HEARD REPORTS AND SEEN FIRST HAND THAT SOME COURTS INCLUDING SACRAMENTO COUNTY SISKIYOU COUNTY. HAVE REYES BARRIERS TO INDIVIDUALS CLEARING A FAILURE TO APPEAR HOLD ON A DRIVERS LICENSE JUST APPEARING IS NOT ENOUGH FOR EXAMPLE. ONE SOME UP ABSOLUTE HAVE A MINUTE. OKAY. SO. WHAT WE WOULD? WHY PRO WOULD REQUEST IS AS PART OF THE PILOT PROGRAM OR ANY RELATED LEGISLATION THAT AN APPEARANCE BY ANY MEANS WHETHER IT'S A ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION SUBMITTED ONLINE? WHETHER IT'S A WRITTEN DECLARATION COUNTIES IN APPEARANCE AND THAT DRIVERS LICENSE WILL BE LIFTED AT THAT BE CLARIFIED AND THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY ANGER ON LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND I AND MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES. AND WANNA HIGHLIGHT THAT WE DON'T NEED TO PILOT THE IDEA THAT REDUCTIONS IN FEES AND FINES HELP GET LOW INCOME DRIVERS BACK ON THEIR FEET WE SAW THAT ANNA SEES. IT PERCENT REDUCTION GOT TO INNER THOUSAND PEOPLE BACK ON THE ROAD ASTHMA IN THE PILOT PROJECT DOES NOT ENSURE THAT ABILITY TO PAY WILL BE INCLUDED FOR EVERY COURT PILOT IN NET. AND WHILE IT MIGHT CREATE A STANDARDIZED PROCESS IT DOESN'T CREATE A STANDARDIZED INCOME FOR LOW INCOME DEFENDANTS IN THE COURTS THAT ARE PILING IT OR THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LOW INCOME DRIVERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND NEED RELIEF FROM THE HIGH COST OF TICKETS NOW AND THOSE REDUCTIONS SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL. THROUGHOUT THE STATE THANK THANK YOU. HELLO I JEAN AND OLIVER SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE. WE APPRECIATE THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS EFFORT TO DESIGN A PILOT PROGRAM THAT IMPROVES ACCESS AND FAIRNESS OF THE COUNTY A TRAFFIC COURT BY OFFERING ONLINE I'D TRAFFIC CASE OPTIONS INCLUDING ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION. THE RECOGNITION THAT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ONE THE OBJECTIVES OF FISCAL STABILITY FOR THE BRANCH INTO. FEES AND FINES AT SERVICE DETRIMENT AND FAIRLY PUNISHING LAWBREAKERS WITHOUT PUSHING PEOPLE INTO POVERTY OR WORSE JAIL IS A COURAGEOUS ONE. NEVERTHELESS WE BELIEVE ONE THAT THE PILOT DOES NOT ESTABLISH AN ABILITY TO PAY STANDARD. WHICH IS AIMED. WITH THE AID IS NOT A STANDARD IT'S IT'S. BE AT JUST THE PILOT PROGRAM TO IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN THREE YEARS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IMPACT AND BY THEN MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE WILL BE DRIVEN INTO POVERTY WITHOUT THE SYSTEM. THE LACK OF A STANDARD SPECIFICALLY CONCERNING TO US NOT ONLY A STANDARD OF HOW TO CALCULATE IT BUT ALSO HOW TO ENSURE ACCESS TO IT. AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY SOMEONE UP SUMMING UP. SO. A YEAR AGO WILL BE COMMISSIONED A REPORT BY LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHT THAT WAS REFERENCE BEFORE THE NINE COUNTIES IN THE BAY AREA THAT. SHOULD HAVE HAD AN ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION I HAD NONE IN THEIR WEBSITE ONLINE OR IN PERSON. SO IF WE HAD DON'T HAVE A STANDARD BOTH FOR ACCESS IS WAYS TO CALCULATE IT I'M THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE PEOPLE COLOR WILL BE. MOST ARE IMPACTED BY THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON WENT BOTTOM ALL REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION WE SUPPORT EQUITABLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE HOWEVER THIS PROPOSAL HAS CERTAIN CONCERNS VERTICALLY WITH OUR. COMMUNITY THAT SPEAKS A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AND THEN ALSO HOW TO ADDRESS ANY RECOMMENDATION THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD FOR THEM TO ACCESS A PILOT SUCH AS THIS BUT I ALSO ECHO OUR CONCERNS WITH THE. OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OUR COMMITMENT TO CLEAN GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED ARE FROM ACCESS TO THE INTERNET CRITICALLY IN RURAL AREAS SO IS THERE STILL CONCERNS TO BE. HAD HERE AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD THANK YOU. I MADAM CHAIR MICRO WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY A WE WE STAND. IN CAN IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE AND CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE OUTLINE OF THE ISSUES I AM I I WOULD JUST NOTE TO THE COMMITTEE. ON THIS IS A SIX YEAR OLD ISSUE WE'VE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS OF THE ADMINISTRATION GOVERNOR IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN GREAT THE COURTS HAVE WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH US FOR MANY YEARS. ALL LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO PASS A BILL AB FIVE WITH THREE BY SIMPLY MEMBER LACKEY THE CREATED SIMILAR STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR PARKING TICKETS WE DO NOT THINK IT'S A BIG STEP TO DO THE SAME TO HAVE ACROSS THE BOARD YOU OCCASIONS. OF THESE TICKETS FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND GIVING THOSE DISCOUNTS. I WANT TO KNOW WE DO SUPPORT ONLINE EDUCATION WE DO THINK IT'S THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON THESE MATTERS AND LOOK FOR TO KEEP DOING SO. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TO HAVE GOOD AFTERNOON KEVIN AS THEIR QUARTERS CALIFORNIA FOR RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WITH SUPPORT OF THE POP OF THE PROPOSAL. AN ONLINE A COMMON THROUGH PREVIOUS COMMENTS OF THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAUREN CLIMB WITH THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE THE COMMENTS OF MY LEGAL AID COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY AND SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS IN THE DAIS. REMEMBER COUNTLESS ROOM BOOKLET JUST SOME CLARIFICATION I. I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ó WANTED TO MAKE SURE PROGRAM WORKS FULLY. BEFORE FUNDING ACROSS THE STRAIT BUT. IT SEEMS LIKE WE DO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF DATA ALREADY. WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE THE BENEFIT FOR EXTENDING THIS? THIS ANALYSIS. I'M SORRY SOMEONE THOUGH RIGHT WITH THE ANALYSIS. YES I DO THE PROPOSED. PILOT PROGRAM. WELL WHAT WHAT THE PARENT WILL ALLOW US TO DO IS IS IT WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR THE ONLINE ADJUDICATION OF TRAFFIC MATTERS. AND SO. AND THEN IT WILL WILL ADDRESS BOTH TRIAL BY WRITTEN DECLARATION AND TRIAL DE NOVO AND SO WHAT WE WHAT WE ANTICIPATE DOING AND THEN ADDRESS SOME OF THE ABILITY TO PAY CONCERNS AT THAT HAVE BEEN. THE TOPIC OF OF MANY OF THE COMMENTS AND SO WHAT WHAT THIS WHAT WHAT WE ANTICIPATE DOING IS. GATHERING DATA. FROM THE TOOL ACTUALLY WE ARE WORKING WITH THE VENDOR TO DESIGN THE TOOL SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO EXTRACT DATA. AND THEN WE WILL PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. TO WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION TO THE U. S. DOJ AS PART OF THE GRANT THAT WE RECEIVED AND THEN ALSO TO LEGISLATURE. OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. NO COMMENTS. OKAY I THINK VIA AUDIENCES HAS RAISED SOME VERY IMPORTANT COMMENTS AND CONCERNS AND SO. I THINK THERE'S SOME INFORMATION HERE WITH REGARDS TO MAKING SURE THAT. LEAST THESE. THE SOFTWARE AND AND THE OF THAT. WILL BASICALLY HAVE THOSE OTHER ELEMENTS IN IT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO CAN AND CANNOT PAY I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN CONCERN. MUCH OF EVERYONE BEEN NOT OPPOSED TO ONLINE IN AND HAVING ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY BUT THE QUESTION IS CAN ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS AND MAKE THE DETERMINATION THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT. US SO THAT WE DON'T FURTHER SEND PEOPLE INTO. AND DEBT AND DIFFICULTY OH BY HAVING SOMEONE THAT'S KIND OF VERY SO GENERIC THAT AGO DID IT MEET MEETS THE NEEDS OF. SUPPOSED EVERYONE AND NO ONE AT THE SAME TIME SO I. WILL LOOK AT THAT AND SO I I THINK IT IS POINTED OUT ALSO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE. THAT WE DO COME BACK AND ASSESS WHAT THE NOT WE WANT TO CONTINUE BECAUSE WE DO OFTEN PILOT THINGS. THE RIVER PILOT IS THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A TRIAL AARON TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEN MAKE A DECISION WHETHER NOT YOU WANT TO CONTINUE. MANY TIMES WITH WE USE THE TERM PILOT WHEN WE JUST WAS ABLE TO REALLY SAY WILL START THIS LIFELONG ACTIVITY SO. I'M I'M HOPING THAT. THAT WILL TAKETHAT INTO CONSIDERATION SERIOUSLY THAT IS A PILOT SO WE CAN MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF IT. OF BEFORE WE FIND OURSELVES OVERWHELMED WITH IT AND THEN ONCE AGAIN LOOKING FOR ANOTHER PILOT THINK IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD NOT AYE ISSUE NUMBER THAT ITEM TO WILL BE HELD OPEN. WE'RE GOING TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS A SELF HELP CENTER. TOM. THANK YOU OKAY. OF GOOD AFTERNOON I'M BUNNY HOP FAN I'M A MANAGING ATTORNEY WITH A JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA AND WORK ON SELF HELP PROGRAMS. AND THIS IS. A REQUEST FOR EXPANSION OF SELF HELP CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALREADY HAVE A CENTERS IN EVERY COUNTY AND WITH ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ARE OVER ABLE TO SERVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR IT'S JUST. AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF SERVICE THAT'S PROVIDED. GENERALLY THAT PROGRAMS ARE IN FAMILY LAW WHICH AREA OF HUGE NEED. BUT WE KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE A NEW EVERY DAY THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CANNOT BE SERVED IN THE SELF HELP CENTERS JUST WITH. CURRENT FUNDING AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN AREAS LIKE CLAMOR TENANT. CONSERVATORSHIP GUARDIANSHIP. AND CONSUMER PROBLEMS MANY MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO GO TO COURT WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF AN ATTORNEY SELF HELP CENTERS PEOPLE HELP PEOPLE FILL OUT FORMS EXPLAINED THE PROCESS. HELP THEM ENFORCE THEIR ORDERS ONCE. THE JUDGE MAKES AN ORDER OR HELP THEM COMPLY DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION. AND JUST MAKES THE ENTIRE SYSTEM MOVE MORE SMOOTHLY BUT MOST CRITICALLY IT GIVES PEOPLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THEY COURTS HAVE INDICATED A NEED FOR AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ARE SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. BUT THE SO THAT SIDE NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION WILL BE A HUGE HELP OF. A IN IN ADDRESSING THOSE NEEDS AND. WE ANTICIPATE OF EXPANDING ALSO IN AND NOW. BY USING MORE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN ASSISTANCE BUT THE REALITY IS A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE JUST NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO. AND THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO EXPLAIN THE PROCESS AND TO HOLD THEIR HAND AND HONESTLY ISSUES ARE AWFULLY COMPLICATED AND. OFTEN HARD TO DEAL WITH WITH COMPUTER PROGRAMS SO THOSE ARE GROUP THAT'S A GREAT SUPPLEMENT IS ABLE TO SERVE A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT. THE COURTS REALLY NEED THAT IN PERSON STAFFING TO PROVIDE THIS ASSISTANCE OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. YES REBEKAH KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WANT TO REITERATE THE NEED FOR THIS PROPOSAL. AND A WHITE JUSTIFIES AND ONGOING INVESTMENT AS WE HEARD FROM MR SHINO EARLIER ON THIS IS SELF HELP IS THE FASTEST GROWING PUBLIC NEED FACING THE COURT SYSTEM. WITH NINETY PERCENT OF WHAT AGAINST A FAMILY LAW M. ARRIVING TO COURT WITHOUT REPRESENTATION NINETY PERCENT OF TENANTS AND EVICTION CASES. AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF CIVIL CASES AT LEAST ONE PARTY DOES NOT HAVE REPRESENTATION. WE'VE ALSO HEARD IN LARGE OR URBAN COURTS FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME IS AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR PARTS ONLY SEVEN MINUTES OF INITIAL TRIAGE TIME FROM THE SELF HELP CENTER. THIS ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT WILL HELP THE COURTS TO SERVE OVER ONE MILLION ADDITIONAL SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS STATEWIDE. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE INCLUDED THAT THE FULL AMOUNT. BOTH THE CONTINUING INVESTMENT AND THIS NEW NINETEEN POINT ONE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROCUREMENT OF THIRTY POINT THREE MILLION. THE NEW BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WILL ASSURE THAT THIS MONEY IS ALL SPENT FOR. SOME ASSISTANCE IN THE SELF HELP CENTERS IN THE COURTS AND IF IT IS NOT IT WILL REVERT TO THE GENERAL FUND. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM ILLEGAL. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. OF THE SELF HELP SERVICES BY NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. A LIMITED SCOPE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE DOES SUGGEST THAT THESE SERVICES CAN PROVIDE STATE BENEFIT WHILE INCREASING ACCESS TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. A RIGOROUS ANALYSIS WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHAT THE TOTAL LEVEL OF NEED IS WHERE FUNDING SHOULD BE TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE BOTH STATE AND PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND WHETHER FUNDING ALLOCATIONS NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED ELSEWHERE TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY SAVINGS. UNTIL THE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE WE DO THINK IT IS REASONABLE TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THAT ANALYSIS WOULD BE COMPLETE. AS THE COURTS REPORT TURNING AWAY INDIVIDUALS WERE SEEKING ASSISTANCE. THE EXACT AMOUNT TO PROVIDE WOULD DEPEND ON THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES FOR GENERAL FUND SPENDING SELF HELP SERVICES ARE OTHER PART PROGRAMS. TO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE OF ME WANTS TO TARGET FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SERVICE IS PROVIDED IN CERTAIN ISSUE AREAS ACROSS ALL TRIAL COURTS. OR THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS FUNDED A STATEWIDE LEVEL ON PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED STATEWIDE TO ASSIST MORE INDIVIDUALS. I'M IN REGARDS TO THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL AS IT DOES INCREASE THE ACCOUNTABLE USE OF THESE DOLLARS. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. ANY QUESTIONS HERE FOR MEMBERS STONE. JUST HEARD LIKE THE WAY IN AND SAY THAT I THINK THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PRIORITY THOUGH THAT WE SHOULD THE FUNDING I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED THE ONGOING NEED. AND IT IS IN THE MONEY. WILLING TO TO PUT INTO THIS YEAR WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE BY SOME THE COMMUNITIES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO NEED IT THE MOST AND WE ARE MOVING MORE AND MORE UNFORTUNATELY TO SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS AND THE SELF HELP CENTERS ARE A SIGNIFICANT. PART OF THEIR ABILITY TO GET ACCESS TO JUSTICE. OKAY ANYONE. YET A COMMON YES I'M SO IN A COUPLE WITH A LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE INSTANCE SUPPORT OF THE INCREASE FUNDING FOR SELF HELP CENTERS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY FUN I THINK MOST OF THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED AND I'VE. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING MOST OF US IN FAVOR OF SELF HELP CENTERS. WITH SOME. OBVIOUSLY LIMITATIONS BUT THERE BUT CLEARLY THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE TO IT WILL MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. OKAY THANK YOU THAT TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR. OF SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS SERVICES SUPPORT WEB PORTAL. WE'LL BE HAVING STAFF COMING UP AND THEY'RE GIVING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. HAVE TO DEMAND CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK LATE AND I AM THE SUPERVISOR OF THE JC IT WEBSERVICES TEAM. AND I'M GONNA PROVIDERS THE HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF THIS. SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS SRL E. SERVICES PORTAL. THE GOVERNOR'S UPDATED APRIL BUDGET PROPOSED THREE POINT TWO MILLION AND FOUR POSITIONS FOR SELF WRITTEN THAT AT SUPPER PRISON LITIGANTS ON PORTAL. TO BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF LITIGANTS WHO ARE SEEKING TO RESEARCH IN FILE NON CRIMINAL CASES WITHOUT THE EXPENSE OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION. AND. IT IS VERY GERMANE TO OUR SOCIETY TODAY WHEN MOST EVERY GOVERNMENT AGENCY ON THE PLANET IS TRYING TO TRANSFORM BUSINESSES THAT TO BECOME A DIGITAL SERVICE. SO THINK OF THIS AS A DIGITAL SERVICE CHANGING PARADIGM. WE ARE. BASICALLY TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO EXPECTATIONS ARE NO LESS STATE CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH AMAZON ONLINE DMV ONLINE AIRLINES AND THEIR BANKS. AND. WE HOPE TO MAKE THAT THE SAME WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO ONE OF THE GOALS IN THE CURRENT JUDICIAL BRANCH STERN. PLAN OF FOR TECHNOLOGY IS TO CREATE DIGITAL COURT. AND YOU'LL HEAR THAT TERM WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF OUR OUR DOCUMENTATION ON OUR STRATEGIC PLAN. AND BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS DELIVER MORE SERVICES ONLINE AND STOP PREVENT PEOPLE FROM MAKING UNNECESSARY TRIPS TO THE COURTS. THE REQUESTED FUNDING AUGMENTATION WILL ENABLE US TO DESIGN BUILD AND DELIVER A STATEWIDE E. SERVICES PORTAL. SERVE THE GROWING NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE IN FILE LEGAL ISSUES OUT WITHOUT THE COST OF AN ATTORNEY. THE. THE THE INFANT THE ENVISIONED PROGRAM IS AN END TO END CUSTOMER JOURNEY FOR FOR LITIGANTS. BILL GUIDE WE WILL GUIDE PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROCESS BEGINNING WITH AN EDUCATIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL COMPONENT WE WILL SUPPLEMENT THAT WITH DOCUMENT ASSEMBLY ALLOWING THEM TO FILL DOCUMENTS OUT. WITH FORM BUILDERS AND EVENTUALLY TO EFILE AND YOU SUBMIT THEIR THEIR THEIR CASE FILES ONLINE. THE PORTAL WILL BE ADA ACCESSIBLE IT WILL BE MOBILE FRIENDLY AND IT WILL BE MULTI LINGUAL. TODAY CALIFORNIANS MUST GET IN THEIR CARS. DRIVE TO THE COURTHOUSE LOOK FOR A PARKING SPOT WAIT MINE. OFTEN DEFINE THAT THEY'VE COME TO COURT WITHOUT THE RIGHT FORM OR THEY'VE GOT THE RIGHT FORM IS FILLED OUT INCORRECTLY. THAT E. SERVICES PORTAL WILL AIM TO CHANGE THAT PARADIGM AND DELIVER. I'M REALLY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND. ACCESS TO PEOPLE WHO REALLY AND A LIFE CRISIS ONE VIABLE SITUATIONS ARM TO BASICALLY FILL OUT AND FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES CORRECTLY. SO THE REQUESTED AUGMENTATION REALLY IS IT'S AS ON FOUR PILLARS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE ENTERPRISE WEB CONTENT MANAGEMENT PLATFORM. AND THIS WILL ENABLE US TO DELIVER THE SERVICES THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY BUILT TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. I'M ARE SECONDLY WE WILL INVEST AND A LAYER OF INTERACTIVE EDUCATIONAL ON INSTRUCTIONAL INFORMATION. I GUIDED INTERVIEWS. VIDEO TUTORIALS GLOSSARIES ONLINE GLOSSARIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE. ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION THEY NEED. WE HEARD SOMEONE ADMITS IN CHAT BOX WE ALSO ANDERSON CHAT BOX TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW FOLKS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ONLINE TO GET ANSWERS TO GET LINKS TO OTHER RESOURCES. THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN ANSWER THIRTY NINE MILLION PHONE CALLS OR EVEN WANT TO ONE EMAILS SO WE'RE GOING TO LEVERAGE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO DO A BETTER JOB OF ANTICIPATING. USER QUESTIONS AND NEEDS. AND FINALLY WE WILL. TOGETHER TECHNOLOGISTS AND DEVELOPERS AND WE WILL DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION THAT GOES FROM THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS TO LEARN HOW TO DO SOMETHING ALL THE WAY TO FILING A CASE. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT WHICH WE'RE GONNA START DOING IT INCREMENTALLY BIT BY BIT. THANK YOU. YOU COME AS FINANCE. HE HAS JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THIS ITEM REALLY COMPLIMENTS THE LAST ITEM THAT WE DISCUSSED THE NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN SELF HELP CENTERS. WITH THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THAT NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION INVESTMENT IN SELF HELP CENTERS ACTUALLY GOES TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE WITHIN THOSE SELF HELP CENTERS IN EACH TRIAL COURT. AND THIS INVESTMENT WOULD CREATE. AS WE JUST HEARD THE PORTAL FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE INFORMATION ONLINE. AND WE SEE THOSE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALSO. THIS PORTAL WILL ALLOW SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO ADDRESS MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD ISSUES THROUGH THE ONLINE SYSTEM IN NOT INTO AND ENVIRONMENT AND. ALSO WILL FREE UP RESOURCES THAT THE SELF HELP CENTERS FOR THOSE THAT ACTUALLY NEED IN PERSON ASSISTANCE AND CURRENT. INCOME AS WELL. WE HAVE NOT COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME AND ARE RECOMMENDING HOLDING IT OPEN SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR INFORMATION AND. ONLINE HOW THE FUNDING NUMBERS WERE CALCULATED AND HOW IT ALIGNS TO THE TENTATIVE ON IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WE WOULD NOTE HOWEVER THAT IT IS NOT QUITE CLEAR TO US WHY THIS PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY SEPARATES FROM THE LAST ONE THAT YOU CONSIDERED. YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS IN THIS MANNER THROUGH A WEB PORTAL. ON IS A PRIORITY IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHY A PORTION OF THE FUNNY COULD NOT BE DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TO THIS PURPOSE. OKAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS FROM ALL. MEMBERS IT WAS A STOP TO US JUST SPECIFICALLY TO THAT EFFECT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE. THE ACCOUNTING SEPARATE ON THIS BECAUSE OF WERE WORKING TO DEVELOP A WEB PORTAL I THINK THAT SHOULD BE. SEPARATE FROM THE THE MONEY THAT'S GOING INTO SELF HELP THAT ONE DOES HELP THE OTHER AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THEM IN THE SAME CONVERSATION I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOCATE THE NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS WHAT THE ONGOING MONEY THAT. WHAT WAS THERE PLUS WHAT'S BEEN ADDED AND DECIDE WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THAT ON A WEB PORTAL THAT COULD EAT UP THE MONEY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USE? FOR THAT. THE PROGRAMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO I WOULD JUST. GRACE OCCASSION ABOUT DIPPING INTO THESE FUNDS AND KEEP THEM SEPARATE. OKAY ANY OTHER ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WHEN I ASKED ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES TO CHAIR THE MEETING I GOTTA GO DO A PRESENTATION. YOU LIKE AUTHORITY OKAY. WITH THAT IT. YEAH. NUMBER FIVE. THE COUPLE TO DISMISS SPACECRAFT. SO WE'RE HOLDING THIS ITEM. THANK YOU. BUT THE OTHER THAT I AM FIVE THEIR SUMMER COURSE THAT I'VE MADE BUT THERE'S ALSO AN ITEM SIX PSYCHO PRESENT FROM HERE IF YOU DON'T WANNA. OKAY DISMAY SANTA THEM ANYWHERE YOU WANT ALRIGHT. US GO FROM HERE SO IF YOU'RE HERE FOR ITEM SIX AS WELL JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE. SO IN IN LINES. I'M BACK AGAIN ASKING SOME OF THE SAME THINGS ASK FOR LAST YEAR I DO APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE. REALLY FOCUSING ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS AS. WE HAVE PRESENTED. THAT PART OF MY A ASK IS LOOKING AT THE SELF HELP FUNDING WHICH WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT. HOW THE TWO ASPECTS OF IT AGAIN FROM ASKING THAT WE REQUIRE COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW COURT? IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT FAMILY LAW ARE PRIMARILY SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS AND WITHOUT HAVING A RECORD IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. TO APPEAL OR REALLY TO EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE DECISIONS WORK AND I THINK IT'S PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE RECORD IN FAMILY LAW COURT AND I WOULD LIKE. THIS COMMITTEE TO RECOMMEND THAT WE FUND FULLY FUNDS AT LEAST IN FAMILY LAW COURT THAT. THAT WE HAVE. COURT REPORTERS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THE OTHER ONE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IS THAT WE INCREASE THE EQUAL ACCESS FUNDING. LAST YEAR WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING A TEN MILLION DOLLAR. OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD EQUAL ACCESS TO TO JUSTICE FUNDING. A MATTHEW FOR THAT. THAT THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS BE NOW MADE PERMANENT SO THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN GOING GUARANTEE OF AT LEAST TEN MILLION DOLLARS. PLUS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STARTING TO TO SIGNIFICANTLY BACK OFF ON ITS COMMITMENT. TO LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY PRIMARILY OUR. LOW INCOME. LITIGANTS COMING OUT OF AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO AUGMENT WITH SELF HELP CENTERS AND OTHERS. ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THOSE ATTORNEYS OUT THERE WHO ARE NECESSARY WHETHER IT'S IMMIGRATION CONTACTS OR ANY OTHER CONTACTS THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY FUNDED. LEGAL ACCESS TO SERVICES. THROUGH FOR THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S THE DIVISIONAL BUDGET ASK MAKE THE TEN MILLION PERMANENT AND THAT I'M ASKING FOR AND THAT WE INCREASE. THAT OF THE ABOUT THE BY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR SO THAT WE CAN GET. ADDRESS A LOT OF THE BACKLOG OF ACCESS TO. TO LEGAL SERVICES. AND YOU HAVE ANY. WITNESSES OR IT'S JUST ME ISSUE. OF. FEATHER ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ITEM NUMBER. FIVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE BUDGET PRIORITIES. MORE THAN A COUPLE OF PEOPLE. ONE. HI AGAIN SELENA COPELAND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDED MATERIALS AND PAPER COPIES HERE BUT ALSO SOME ELECTRONIC COPY TO JENNIFER AS WELL. THERE'S A COPY FOR ALL MEMBERS AND FOR STAFF. AND SO I WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE REFERENCE WAS REALLY AND THE NEED FOR INCREASED STABLE FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID HEARING CALIFORNIA. I'M OUR ORGANIZATIONS RIGHT NOW SERVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CLIENTS PER YEAR WITH THREE SERVICES ALL THE WAY UP TO REPRESENTATION NICK AT. AND AT AT SETTLEMENTS AT TRIAL AND APPELLATE HEARINGS BUT THAT'S REALLY JUST ONE PIECE OF THE ICEBERG AS WE SERVE MANY MORE THROUGH SELF HELP SERVICES THROUGH EDUCATIONAL NO YOU'RE RIGHT PRESENTATIONS AND OTHER KEY PRESENTATIONS. BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR FREE LEGAL AID BASED ON THEIR INCOME LEVEL BUT ONLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS TO SERVE THEM. TOOK QUITE A CASELOAD AND AND IF YOU THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A LEGAL PROBLEM EACH YEAR YOU'D BUTTE AND FORCEFULLY BE WRONG. OF A RECENT NATIONAL STUDY SHOWED THAT ABOUT SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE AT LEAST ONE CIVIL LEGAL A PROBLEM EVERY A CIVIL LEGAL PROBLEM EVERY SINGLE YEAR MANY OF THEM MAY HAVE MORE THAN ONE PROBLEM. AND I'M IT'S USUALLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON ISSUES OF THEIR HOUSING OF VETERANS BENEFITS ISSUES ISSUES OF ACCESSING SERVICES HEALTH ACCESS. AND SO LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO STEP IN AND HELP THEM BUT ONLY IF WE HAVE THE FUNDING TO ACTUALLY HAVE ATTORNEYS OF THE OFFICES TO SUPPORT THEM. AND. EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD THOSE LEGAL PROBLEMS ACTUALLY WERE UNABLE TO GET AN ADEQUATE OR ANY LEGAL HELP AT ALL. SO AND WE DO SUPPORT THE INCREASE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ONE MINUTE.

GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMAN JONES SAWYER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M WHITE COURTNEY. A VET YIGAL CLOSER. SURE. THE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES EIGHT PROJECTS OF FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. LIMON FUNDING FOR THE. CONTINUATION OF DESIGN IS PROPOSED FOR THRILLS PROJECTS AND FUNDING FOR CONSTRUCTION IS PROPOSED FOR FIVE OF THE PROJECTS. THE YELLOW THREE PROJECTS PROPOSED FOR ADDITIONAL DESIGN FUNDS. ARSENAL BUT CINEMA COUNTY COURTHOUSE LOCATED IN SANTA ROSA. FOR ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION. BECAUSE. STANISLAUS COUNTY COURTHOUSE LOCATED IN MODESTO FOR FIFTEEN POINT THREE MILLION. AND THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY. COURTHOUSE LOCATED IN MENIFEE CALIFORNIA FOR FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION. THERE ARE FIVE PROJECTS AS I MENTIONED PROPOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION FUNDING. USING LEASE FOR LEASE REVENUE BONDS BOTH PROJECTS. OR THE IMPERIAL COUNTY COURTHOUSE LOCATED IN EL CENTRO CALIFORNIA FOR FORTY ONE POINT NINE MILLION. SISKIYOU COUNTY COURTHOUSE LOCATED Y. RICO.

WHERE WHERE ARE AT WERE NOT OPPOSED TO THE? ELLIOTT'S RECOMMENDATION TO REASSESS THE PROGRAM BEFORE ANY FUTURE PROJECTS ARE RECOMMENDED BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT WILL TAKE TIME AND MONEY. ANDWE STILL BELIEVE THAT THE TEN THAT ARE PROPOSAL BEFORE WOULD STILL BE THE TEN THAT WERE PROPOSED BECAUSE THE CRITERIA THAT. PUT THEM ON THE IMMEDIATE CRITICAL NEEDS LESS TEN YEARS AGO ARE STILL THERE AND IF ANYTHING THE. A BILL THAT'S OF CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE. A WORLD WHERE THE DECLINING REVENUE SITUATION ON THE SPECIAL FUNDS WHICH SAYS SUPPORT THE LEASE REVENUE PAYMENTS ON THE CURRENT. BONTA HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLD AND IT'S FOR THAT REASON THAT WE RECOMMEND AT THE GENERAL FUND BE THE SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE OF THE SEVEN ABOUT PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I WOULD THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO REDIRECT THE FUNDS FROM. A SPECIAL FUNDS TO THE GENERAL FUND AZEGLIO HAS RECOMMENDED BECAUSE EVEN WITH DECLINING REVENUES THOSE. FUNDS ARE SCHEDULED TO BE. SOLVENT FOR THE NEAR TERM FUTURE AND WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR MONITOR THOSE FUNDS ON AN ACTIVE BASIS. BEFORE ANY FUTURE PROJECTS WE. REQUESTED IN THAT WHAT IF ANY FUTURE PROJECTS WERE REQUESTED IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD DIE IF I WITH THOSE AT THAT TIME WITH WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES AND OTHER STATE PRIORITIES. THANK LA A.

SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE FIRST PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. AND SO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FACILITIES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL WAS AUTHORIZED SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN THE ASSESSMENT SELECTION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THESE PROJECTS. THERE WERE TWO ACCOUNTS THAT WERE CREATED TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS ON THEIR BOTH FUNDED BY INCREASED BUT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINE IF YOU REVENUES. AND THE TWO ACCOUNTS OF THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND AS CFCF CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. AND A MEDIA CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNT CREATED AND. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OF PARTICULAR NOTE RELATED TO ECONOMIC JUDICIAL COUNCIL WAS ACTUALLY PROHIBITED FROM AUTHORIZING ANY. EXPENDITURES THAT THE FUNDS COULD NOT SUPPORT. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT. THERE IS A LACK OF REVENUE AND BOTH OF THE ACCOUNTS AND THIS IS REALLY FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST AS SHOWN BEFORE YOU ON IN THE TABLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN A TOTAL OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION HAS BEEN RE DIRECTED TO EITHER THE GENERAL FUND OR TO TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS AND THIS GENERALLY COINCIDED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THE FISCAL DOWNTURN. TO DATE CURRENTLY FIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION CONTINUES TO BE TRANSFERRED TO TRIAL COURT OPERATION. ADDITIONALLY THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT'S DEPOSITED INTO THESE ACCOUNTS HAVE STEADILY DECLINED OVER THE PAST DECADE. SO THIS LACK OF REVENUE THEN LEADS TO TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS IF YOU TURN TO PAGES AND FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT. THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS AN INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE THE PLANNED PROJECTS. AS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FOURTEEN PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED FROM FC FCF HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. HOWEVER OUT OF THE FORTY ONE PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED FROM AETNA ONLY TWELVE HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. TEAM ARE ON HOLD AND ELEVEN ARE INDEFINITELY DELAYED. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT THE SECOND MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT OBLIGATIONS. THE FOR EXAMPLE THE S. CFCF IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE ONGOING EXPENDITURES A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN EIGHTY SIX MILLION IN PROJECTED REVENUE LOSS. SO BOTH OF THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN FUNDING THESE ONGOING EXPENDITURES BY DRAWING DOWN THERE FUND BALANCES AND BOTH FUNDS ARE LESS EXPECTED TO BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ABSENT ANY CHANGES AND REVENUES ARE EXPENDITURES. TURN TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR HAND OUT I THINK THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF A GOOD JOB KIND OF SUMMARIZING THE PROPOSAL IT IS ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LEASE REVENUE BONDS BACKED BY THE GENERAL FUND. INSTEAD OF AETNA IF YOU LOOK AT THE TABLE BEFORE YOU ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THIS WILL MEAN ANNUAL THAT SERVICE OF A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR HAND OUT. WE GENERALLY FIND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS A REASONABLE AS EFFECTIVELY IN USED TO FINANCE PROJECTS. HOWEVER WHILE THAT PROJECTS THAT ARE SELECTED ARE THE CLOSEST TO CONSTRUCTION IT IS UNCLEAR TO US WHETHER THEY REPRESENT THOSE THAT OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. IN THIS IS BECAUSE THEY WERE SELECTED AND IT'S FAST ABOUT A DECADE AGO AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE SELECTED DIFFERENT PROJECTS IF THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO ADDRESS KEY PROBLEMS FACING THE SYSTEM. ONE THE CONTINUED DECLINE AND FINING FEE REVENUE. THE FACT THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT SECONDS THE FACT THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT REVENUE TO MEET EXISTING OBLIGATIONS WHICH CAN MEAN THAT THE GENERAL FUND MAY NEED TO PROVIDE NINETY TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS. THAT WOULD BE ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND FINALLY THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR PLAN FOR HOW FUTURE PROJECTS WILL BE FUNDED WILL BE FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR. FROM THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS WHEN THERE'S AVAILABLE FUNDING. SO TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS ANA ONGOING BASIS WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND OVERHAULING THE. AND OUR RECOMMENDATION HAS FOUR COMPONENTS. WE RECOMMEND SHIFTING THE FUNDING FOR TROPPER PROJECTS CURRENT AND FUTURE ONES TO THE GENERAL FUND. THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD BASED ON LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES RATHER THAN HOW MUCH FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE IN IN THESE ACCOUNTS. I WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS CLEARLY AWARE OF THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND OBLIGATION THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MOVE THAT PROJECT FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY WE THEN RECOMMEND SHIFTING THE REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED INTO THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS TO MOVED OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT THEY'RE STILL AVAILABLE TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DEBT SERVICE THAT WAS SHIFTED. THIRD WE RECOMMEND SHIFTING THE NON CONSTRUCTION RELATED EXPENSES OVER AND APPROPRIATING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO MAINTAIN THOSE SERVICE LEVELS. AND FINALLY FOR ANY FUTURE PROJECTS WE RECOMMEND THAT THEY MOVE FORWARD BASED ON LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND AND HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHAT THOSE PROJECTS WOULD BE WE DO RECOMMEND A REASSESSMENT OF THE PROJECT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE OF YOUR HAND OUT IF THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT INTERESTED AND OVERHAULING THE SYSTEM. WE DO RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND FIVE WAYS TO AT LEAST MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENT. SO THE FIRST IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE TWO ACCOUNTS TO ENSURE THAT NO PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD UNLESS THEY'RE SUFFICIENT TOTAL REVENUE TO SUPPORT THEM. AS THIS COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE GENERAL FUND BACKFILL THAT'S NEEDED IN THE FUTURE. SECONDS WE RECOMMEND TERMINATING THE ANNUAL FIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER FROM THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS TO TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS AND INSTEAD PROVIDE THE ROUTE THOSE RESOURCES FROM THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD. THIRD WE RECOMMEND TRANSFERRING A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNT. BUT REQUIRE THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL ADDRESS ANY EXISTING OBLIGATIONS BEFORE ANY NEW PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WOULD BE UNCLEAR HOW MANY NEW PROJECTS WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. FOURTH WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO SUBMIT A LONG TERM FUND CONDITION STATEMENT WITH ANY FUTURE FUNDING REQUEST TO DEMONSTRATE. THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO MEET EXISTING OBLIGATIONS IN ADDITION TO ANY NEW ONES. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE RECOMMEND. THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO REASSESS THE PROJECT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE OF HIGHEST PRIORITY ARE ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M ELIZABETH ESPINOSA ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE. FOR IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE RENEWED INVESTMENT AND QUIRK CONSTRUCTION. THE REASONS OBVIOUSLY ARE. CERTAINLY THE IMPORTANT ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR COURT USERS BUT ALSO IT'S IN RECOGNITION. OF THE VERY MANY WAYS IN WHICH COURT AND COUNTY FUNCTIONS STILL INTERACT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE ARE LOTS OF COUNTIES FUNCTIONS THAT ARE DEPENDENT. OR INTERTWINED WITH THE COURT FUNCTION AND FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT SAFE NEW AND MODERN COURTHOUSES AND IN PARTICULAR APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT THIS YEAR THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS HOME. YOU DON'T GET MUCH BETTER. YET THANK YOU OPEN ARM. ACTUALLY I AM VERY INTERESTED IN AND AND THIS AND YOU'RE KIND OF IN MY WHEELHOUSE RIGHT ABOUT NOW. I MISSED A FORMER DIRECTOR RELEASED A FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND VERY FAMILIAR FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE DEUKMEJIAN LAW BEACH COURTHOUSE. AND THE COST OF BUILDING THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY. WE'RE SPENDING NOW NOT ONLY NOW BUT. CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE GOING UP. AND IF FOR. SIGH WE WERE GOING TO TRADE WAR WHICH CERTAIN COUNTRIES IT COULD GO UP EVEN MORE. SO I SEE WE HAVE PROJECT EVER INDEFINITELY DELAYED. I I WROTE WILL ASSUME THAT MEANS THAT'S WHEN WE GET AROUND TOO LONG OR WHATEVER WE FIGURE OUT WE GOT MONEY. AND. I'M I'M KIND OF LEANING TOWARD. NOT ONLY OVERHAULING BUT REEVALUATING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AND IN TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO. IT WE CAN'T DO ON WITH THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE. AND THEN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO GO FORWARD. AND SO I AM I. I'M GOING TO GET MORE INFORMATION. ON. LIKE YOU MENTIONED THAT WOULD BE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY GOING INTO CERTAIN FUNDS. I HAVE A FEELING THAT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS HAD INITIAL. ESTIMATE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TWO THOUSAND TEN. AND I WOULD IMAGINE WE'VE BLOWN THAT BUDGET. WHAT WAY OVER THAT THEM IN MOST OF THAT FOR? CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND ANOTHER THING SO. GOING FORWARD EVEN IF YOU WANT A PLAN THAT WE NEED TO. TO REALLY LOOK AT THE. THE RISING COSTS OF OF MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND SO I'M. IF IF SOMEONE COULD COME IN MY OFFICE I WOULD LOVE TO. GO OVER THESE FORTY TWO PROJECTS. I'M ASSUMING SIXTEEN ARE HOLDERS SIXTEEN THAT WE HOPE. ONE DAY YOU WILL BE ABLE. TO DO. AND WE ARE A CANCELED THREE. SO I. THESE COURTHOUSES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT GET THIS DONE. SO I THINK WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND LEGISLATURE WORKING TOGETHER. THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH PLAN THE OTHER THING OUT JUST LIVE WITH THAT AND IN THE CITY. I BUILT SEVERAL POLICE STATION FIRE STATIONS. ON LIBRARIES. AND WHEN WE. DECIDED NOT. TO HAVE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT BE THE PROJECT MANAGER ONLY DECIDED NOT. TO HAVE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BECOME THE PROJECT MANAGER OR LIBRARIAN. AND KIND OF LOOKED AT OUR COSTS AND AND CON A CENTRALIZED EVERYTHING BUT MORE IMPORTANT HAVE STANDARDS FOR OFFICE SIDES. WE SAVED ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. ULTIMATELY WERE ABLE TO COME IN ON TIME. AND UNDER BUDGET. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THE THOUGHT PROCESS THAT WENT INTO EACH OF THESE BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING. EACH ONE HE'S BEEN TREATED YOU MEET. AND YOUR OWN WAY ON HOW THE HOW THE BILL THIS AND. AND I THINK THAT MAY BE PART OF THE THE PROBLEM OF BUILDING WHEN YOU. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGINEERS. WHO ARE OBJECTIVE LOOKING AT THESE PROJECTS AND MAKING DECISIONS? NAM. CAN BE. CAN BE LOW PROBLEMATIC I REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THIS WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE TWENTY TWELVE. AND THEN I WAS TOLD THAT THE JUDGE WAS IN CHARGE OF LOOKING AT IT AND COMING UP WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN WORK WHERE PROJECT MANAGER. BUT THE LEAD TO STILL. WITH LOT OF JUDGES HOA. I DON'T. BELABORED ANYMORE BUT I WOULD. LOW AND I KNOW WE'RE HOLE HEDONISM HOLE. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO. WE GIVE SOME ADVICE SOME INPUT ON THIS. AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND OBVIOUSLY OF THE ALLELES POSITION IS VERY INTERESTING AND AND WE. MAY NEED TO LOOK AT IT MORE CAREFULLY IN TERMS OF. BLENDING THE RESOURCES TOGETHER AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND HOW IT'S FINANCED. I WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE. THE ONE THAT ARE RECOMMENDED THE TEN COURT HOUSES THAT ARE RECOMMENDED WHERE THESE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY IN TERMS OF NEED IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW SPACE AND YOU KNOW OR SOMETHING FALLING APART WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. OF THAT. I AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY ARE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT BUT I WOULD ADD IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS OF EACH ONE OF THE COURTS I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THIS IS. IF THESE ARE HYPER HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR CONSTRUCTION. YOU KNOW I'D I'D I'M INTERESTED IN THAT I HATE TO MESS WITH THE LIST WITH I KNOW HOW THAT IS YOU KNOW THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK COMES IN AND THOSE LIST THAT THE WINDOWS. MAKES A NEW LIST AND THEN GET BUILT ANOTHER PERSON COME LONG PUT ANOTHER LIST TOGETHER SO. I I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND MAYBE YOU ALREADY HAVE DECIDED THAT THESE ARE. THE HIGHEST PRIORITY VERSUS THOSE THAT WERE ALREADY IN LINE THAT WE MADE UP OUR MINDS DO YOU KNOW I MEAN. SWEET A WILD GUESS SINCE THINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE I KNOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GIVE NEW COURTHOUSE ENABLE JUST GOT A NEW ONE. AND I KNOW IMPORTANT AND HOW IT GOOD IT FEELS OF EVEN THE WE DON'T KNOW WHY WE GOT IT SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING HAPPEN AND THEREFORE WE. END UP GETTING IT BASED ON SOME. PROBLEM THAT EXISTED IN THE OLD COURTHOUSE I I DON'T WANT TO GO UP ANY SKELETONS BUT. BUT I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHETHER NOT THESE TWO AND HOW THEY RANK WITH OTHERS OF OTHERS SO. IF WE'VE GOT THESE OTHER FOLKS KIND OF THE SIXTEEN HANG OUT HERE HOW DO THEY FIT PLAN AND THIS IS REALLY ADDRESSING. YOU KNOW THE NEED THAT WE THAT WE HAVE TO. BASICALLY PROVIDE JUSTICE FAIR IN AND CONDITIONS WORKING CONDITIONS THAT A DECENT CONDITIONS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT. I DON'T KNOW. IS THERE ANY ASSESSMENT DONE OF THESE TEN PROJECTS BUT PROGRAM ACCORDING UNJUST THERE WAS OKAY AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSESSMENT THAT WAS DONE STILL VALID TODAY THE REST FOUR CRITERIA. THAT ALL THE PROJECTS WERE PRIORITIZE WITH THE CRITERIA INCLUDES IMPROVING SECURITY OF. SEPARATING THE IN CUSTODY DEFENDANTS FROM THE PUBLIC AND FROM THE COURT STAFF. OF REDUCING OVERCROWDING COMMITS A ANALYSIS OF THE ACTUAL SPACE IN ACCORDANCE COMPARED TO OUR DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR EACH ELEMENT THAT A COURTHOUSE IS MADE UP OF. CORRECTING THE PHYSICAL HAZARDS IN THE BUILDINGS WHICH INCLUDES FIRE. LIFE SAFETY ACCESSIBILITY SEISMIC IN AN OVERALL GENERAL CONDITION OF THE BUILDING ITSELF PROOF MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT. THEN FINALLY IMPROVING THE ACCESS TO COURTS SERVICES WHICH IS AN ASSESSMENT. OF OF THE ACTUAL WORKLOAD ACTUAL JUDGESHIPS IN THAT PARTICULAR COURT. HONG AGAINST A FORECAST OF WHAT THAT WORKLOAD AND FORECAST WHAT THE JUDGESHIPS MIGHT BE FOR THAT COURT. SO THOSE CRITERIA WERE WERE EACH OR THE FIVE POINT SYSTEM DEVELOPED WITH EACH OF THOSE FOUR RIGHT TO ARM. ELEMENTS BEING EQUALLY TREATED. THE HIGHER YOUR SCORE WAS THE HIGHER YOU WERE ON THE LIST FOR REPLACEMENT. ALL THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE IN THE BUDGET TODAY AS PROPOSED OR EITHER LISTED AS A MEDIA OR CRITICAL. AND AND WE DID REASSESS THAT. QUICKLY HERE JUST AS THE BUDGET WAS BEING PROPOSED AND DETERMINE IT'S STILL THE SAME. ADDITIONALLY. FIVE OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE COMPLETELY DESIGN. ALL THE A WE HAVE ALL THE APPROVALS TO CONSTRUCT CLOSE SOME OF THOSE WERE ACTUALLY IN THE BUDGET TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE. FUNDING CONDITION OF THE EGGMAN A REQUIRED US TO STOP THEM. OKAY COUPLE THESE WHAT ARE TO BE DONE OR NEARLY COMPLETELY HAD WE NOT HAD THE FUND. ISSUE WITH THE ACCOUNT WHICH WANT OF A BETTER READY TO GO. OF ALL THE PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET FOR CONSTRUCTION. OKAY WHICH EARLIER PROJECTS THE END OF THE. IMPERIAL COUNTY EL CENTRO SISKIYOU COUNTY WHAT RICO. SHASTA COUNTY REDDING. TUOHY COUNTY SONORA. AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY INTO INDIA THOSE PROJECTS ARE ALL FULLY DESIGNED WE'VE APPROVALS FROM UP I WOULD ALSO NOTE. SO WE SPENT ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON THE EAST TEN PROJECTS TO DATE FROM PRIOR LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS TO ACQUIRE LAND. PERFORMS THE DESIGNS. REVIEW THE BUDGETS ALL THESE PROJECTS WENT BEFORE RADIO. OF OF SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COURT FACILITIES ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND ALL THEIR BUDGETS FOR REDUCED AND THAT ACTUALLY OPENED REDUCED OF. POINT TEN AND TWENTY PERCENT DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS INCREDIBLY HAD A FUND WILL FUND ISSUE AND WE DID NOT WANT TO INCUR MORE LONG BEACH TYPE PROJECTS. OKAY SO YOU SAYING THEY'RE BASICALLY FIVE OF THEM THAT ARE THAT WE HAVE. THERE REALLY HAVE PLANS AND EVERYTHING APPROVAL. AND LANDESMAN PURCHASE THE OTHER FIVE HAVE THEY PURCHASED LAND AND EXPENDITURES JOBS AND MADE ON THOSE AS WELL OTHER BEEN LAND ACQUIRED AND DESIGNED DEVELOPED FOR ALL OF THE OTHER PROJECTS ARE IN THE BUDGET AS WELL OKAY. OKAY. ALL TOTAL FOR THOSE PROJECTS WHICH IS MEANT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OF WITH REGARD TO THE COMBINING OF THE FUNDS THAT CAN THE FUNDS I WOULD THE FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE ON. ON THAT A PETITION HAS DIPPER OFFENSIVE JUST REITERATE WHAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. WOULD THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO COMBINE THE FUNDS BECAUSE EVEN WITH DECLINING REVENUES THEY'RE STILL SCHEDULED TO BE SOLVENT FOR THE NEAR TERM FUTURE. OKAY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU THIS ITEM ASSAILED OPEN AND WILL OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO DISCUSS IT. BUT I THINK THAT INFORMATION GAME WAS VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SOME WOMEN JONES SAWYER BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU TO GO THROUGH THE ACTUAL DETAILS OF. EACH PROJECT ON THE FOR LOVE THE FORTY ONE BUT IN THAT AND IN THE FUTURE PROJECT AS I'M SURE ALICE ONE MAKE SURE WE CAN GET ALL DONE GOODELL. REGRET LEAD TO GREAT. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR. THIS INFORMATION CONCERNING CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ITEM ISSUE NUMBER SIX WILL BE HELD OPEN ALSO. AND IF THE CQ DISINFORMATION WILL MAKE SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT. HAVING NOTHING
