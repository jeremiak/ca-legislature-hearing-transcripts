THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUES AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROGRAM. THIS C. A. C. HOUSE A DIVERSE SET OF PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS. SERVING VETERANS UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SCHOOL CHILDREN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND MORE. THE IMPACT OF OF DECEASED SEE IS FELT IN EVERY LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT. ACROSS THE STATE. THE DEMAND FOR THE GRAND IS NOT BEING MET EACH YEAR. AND THE DEMAND IS GROWING. ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF% THE GRANT APPLICATION ONE UNFUNDED AND I LAST YEAR. AND THERE WAS A ABOUT SURETY TO PARTAKE INCREASE IN APPLICATION FROWN TO PRIOR YEAR. THE CDC SUPPORTS COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE. AND AND THE HOUSE BEING A SOURCE OF BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT. IN THE BUDGET PROCESS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO LAG BEHIND OTHER STATE WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTING IN ART. RECENT BUDGET IMPROVEMENT HAVE TAKEN THOSE FROM THE BACK OF TUPAC TO THE MIDDLE OFF TO PACK. BUT WE SHOULD ASPIRED TO DO BETTER. S. OF. OF THE CREATIVITY OF CREATIVE ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES. AND THIS IS WHY I'M SEEKING AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS PING PONG GOING. FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IN I URGE TO YOU YOUR AYE VOTE WILL HAVE A PEOPLE TESTIFY. YOU TAKING. THE A SUPPORTIVE BY TESTIMONY. YES ARE PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN COOPER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HEARING US WE'RE GRATEFUL. MY NAME IS DAN BROWN CRAWFORD I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. CAO MORE GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR THIS ADDITION TO OUR BUDGET. WE PLAN TO USE THE ADDITION TO FUND SOME OF THE. MENTIONED UNMET NEEDS IN THIS GREAT STATE. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR REQUESTS GO UNFUNDED THIS YEAR AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT PERCENTAGE TO GROW NEXT YEAR. YEAH I'M FOR EXAMPLE JUMPSTART'S. A PROGRAM THAT AND. ITS OPERATING WITHIN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAM. HAD A THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS ALL BY ITSELF. THIS YEAR ADAM. RE ENTRY THROUGH THE ARTS THIRTY TWO PERCENT INCREASE. ARTS EDUCATION WE HAVE A TWENTY PERCENT INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS WHICH IS VERY MEANINGFUL FOR US AND WE'D LIKE TO MEET THAT NEED. WE ALSO PLAN TO EVALUATE OUR EXISTING. GRANTS PROGRAMS THROUGH HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH. SO THAT WE RECEIVE RESULTS THAT ARE BOTH CREDIBLE AND INDEPENDENT. EVALUATION. OF FOR OUR ORGANIZATION. HOPE SAYS TO SEE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WHAT WE DO AS A LARGE GROUP BUT ALSO WE WOULD WE WOULD LIKE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SMALLER NETWORKS THAT WE HAVE IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. OF THE STATE. M. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NONPROFITS RELY TO ASSESS THE DIVERSITY AND EQUITY OF OUR WORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEIR CAPACITY BUILDING MEASURE THE IMPACT OF AUDIENCE IN COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND ASSESS LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR ARTS ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU YOU A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND YOU'VE EVALUATED ONE OF YOU THAT BY WITH ALL THE PROGRAMS ARE WE HAVE EVALUATED OTHER PROGRAMS AND ALL BUT I MIGHT DEPUTIES. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE SOCIETY ON A KEYBOARD AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AND YES WE DO HAVE HISTORY OF EVALUATING OUR GRANTS PROGRAMS. WE HAVE THE JUMPSTART PROGRAMS THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED THAT'S THE PROGRAM THAT'S PROVIDES ART SERVICES. FOR YOUTH THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WE WERE WE WERE FORTUNATE TO RECEIVE AN AUGMENTED ACT RAPPER. GRANT PROGRAM LAST YEAR AND NOW WE'VE EXPANDED ITS FOR THE DIVISION OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SO WE WANT TO EVALUATE THAT PROGRAM. AND WE ALSO HAVE A RE ENTRY GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE EVALUATING ELIGIBLE PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN EXIST IN EXISTENCE ALONG. OTHER JUMPSTART'S PROGRAM HAS BEEN AROUND A BELIEVE FOR THREE THREE YEARS THIS IS THE PERSON WHO FIRST EVALUATION AS TO EXACTLY OKAY THAT THAT WAS THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT RAY AND I REENTRY GRANT PROGRAM IS BEEN AROUND FOR TWO YEARS AND WE'RE EVALUATING THAT NOW. OKAY. THANK YOU. FINANCE. MISTER CHAIR WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT THE ARTS COUNCILS GRANT PROGRAMS CAN ACHIEVE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES UP WE BELIEVE THE POST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT FOR THE COUNCIL. WE'RE CONCERNED THEIR GREATER INFLEXIBLE ENDING MIGHT STRAIN THE OUR COUNCIL'S EXISTING PERSONAL RESOURCES I'M A GREATER EMPHASIS ON IN MEANS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE PROCESS AN INCREASE IN APPROVALS BEING REPROCESSED. AN INCREASE IN THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GRANTEES AND ARE ALSO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER VALUATIONS OF THE PROGRAM SO THEREFORE WE BELIEVE THAT THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT THIS TIME. LL. HOW ENCOURAGED HIM AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WE THINK THAT THE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL IS LARGELY MODEL MATTER OF POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE? THAT WE WOULD KNOW HOWEVER THERE IS RELATIVELY LIVE LIMITED EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN TO THE ARTS COUNCIL. AND SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE DO YOU HAVE. IT ISN'T ALWAYS AS ROBUST AS WE WOULD LIKE IT IS. SORT OF. AS CREDIBLE AND INDEPENDENT AND SO WE THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME ADDITIONAL EVALUATION. BUT JUST A GOOD A WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THE IT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER I'M ASKING YOUR ATTEMPTS OF COUNSEL FOR SOME MORE DETAILS ON HOW. HOW IN FACT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FUNDING IS CREDIBLE THANK YOU MISTER CHIU? I WANT TO JUST OUTSIDE. PORT THE CHAIR OF THE ARTS ENTERTAINED COMMITTEE AND HIS SUGGESTION THAT WE INCREASE OF FUNDING I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW IMPORTANT. THE ARTS ARE TO OUR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR EDUCATION WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMY WHEN IT COMES TO TOURISM. EVEN WITH THE ADVANCES WERE SEEN WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND AND ARTS PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE WITH INDIVIDUALS WERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND THEN OBVIOUSLY ARTS FOR ARTS SAKE. THIS IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE ASSET FOR OUR STATE A IT WASN'T LONG AGO THAT WE AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE DEAD LAST IN PER CAPITA FUNDING FOR THE ARTS. THINK NOW MOST RECENT ITHACA SO WHERE THIRTY FIFTH AND TRYING TO CLIMB UP BUT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE LEADING THAT AND SO I WOULD. SUPPORT AND I DO HOPE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT NUMBER HIGHER I HAVE TO ADMIT. ON HEARING THE PROBLEM FINANCES PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CARRY THIS OUT. THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION BUT IT STRIKES ME ARE WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T NEED THAT MANY RESOURCES TO DISPERSE ANOTHER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING IF THAT'S A WE GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO. I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A WAY TO DO THIS. CERTAINLY WITH AN ALMOST NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SPECKLED BUDGET DUST TO GET US TO A BETTER PLACE SO. I JUST WANTED EXPRESS THAT. WITH CARRIER. SO I'M I'M THIS IS GOING TO BE A AN ITEM THAT'S GOING TO BE HELD OPEN AYE AYE ONE AT SECOND WHAT. MY COLLEAGUE SAID HOWEVER MY EXPERIENCE IN MANY GRANT PROGRAMS IS THAT THOSE THAT KNOW HOW TO GET THE MONEY ARBOR EXIT SUCCESSFUL AND THOSE THAT DON'T. AREN'T VERY SUCCESSFUL AND SO RURAL COMMUNITIES TEND NOT TO GET VERY MUCH AND WHEN THEIR STATE LIMITED STATE RESOURCES SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW. JUST IN TERMS OF YOUR GRANT PROGRAM. YOU KNOW HOW HOW HAVE YOU ENSURED THAT THERE'S A. BROAD BASE OF OF. OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES IT MAY NOT A AND I I'VE HAD A SERIES OF OF BUT CAN NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS AND IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF ON THE OUTS FOR SOME KIND OF ARTS PROGRAM. AND WHEN I LOOK AT IN IN THAT COUNTY OF MONTEREY THAT ARTS MONEY THAT GOES OUT THE MAJORITY OF IT GOES TO THE MONTEREY PENINSULA. AS OPPOSED TO THE SALINAS VALLEY AND SO I'M VERY INTERESTED IN IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE END UP ON DISTRIBUTING FUNDS AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE. SO I AM FIRST OF ALL I I COME TO THIS AGENCY WEARING THE RURAL ADVOCACY HAT. AND THEM I AM VERY PLEASED TO WEAR IT IT'S ALSO THE NEA SEE. CAO FOCUS TO HELP US REACH RURAL COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S VITAL WHEN I SAY THAT WE SHOULD. HAVE A PRESENCE IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IF I FEEL THAT VERY STRONGLY I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EMPHASIZE IT MORE THAN SAY. THEIR OF CENTER FOLKS OUT IN OUR STATE THAT ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPOSSESSED FROM. LARGE URBAN AREAS FROM THE COAST AND THEY DESERVE OUR ATTENTION JUST AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE. IN THE. AND ADD THAT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IN OUR RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE GOING TO BEEF UP OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. PROVIDE SOME WORKSHOPS AND OTHER ACCESS POINTS TO OUR GRANTS PROGRAMS BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE BEEN USING A CERTAIN WAYS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE FAR REACHING. YOU KNOW THAT WE REACH ALL OF THE AREAS OF THE STATE THEY NEED THE SUPPORT. THE EAGLES INFORMATIONAL HOW THE LAST GRANTS WERE DISPERSED IF THEY WANT TO RURAL COMMUNITIES AT ALL THEY DID. AND. I THINK THEY DID GO TO RURAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE WE HAVE AN EDUCATION PROCESS WHAT WHAT FIRST OF ALL WE TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THEN WE HAVE AN ADJUDICATION PROCESS WHERE WE A PANELIST SITTING. ON IT ON THE OTHER. ON THE PANEL SETS REDUNDANT BUT. TO ACTUALLY. AND WE'D WE CHOOSE PANELISTS THAT ARE FROM ALL OVER THE STATE RURAL AND URBAN AS WELL AS IT BEING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD FOR WHATEVER GRANT AWARD. AND PROGRAM THERE ADJUDICATING. AND THAT THAT WAY WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EYES ON. THAT HAS A DUAL FOLD PURPOSE AND WHEN WE HAVE PANELISTS COME IN FROM RURAL AREAS THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE PROCESS THEY GO BACK TO THEIR REGIONS. AND THEN THAT THEN THEY CAN TALK MORE AND EDUCATE MORE PEOPLE ON HOW TO APPLY SO IT. IT'S CYCLICAL. WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE TO A LIST OF ALL OF I. ROLE PANTIES IF THAT WOULD HELP. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND WITH THE SAME PROBLEM THE FOR THE BIGGER CITIES TO GET EATEN. AS LARGER STATIONS KYLE BRING A LOT OF HELP THEY'LL BE HELPFUL TO THINK WE WILL DO THAT. A GOING UP. MISTER CHOI. OKAY IN CONCEPT I WOULD ALSO A SUPPORT THAT UP BUT IF YOU WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE. LOOKING AT THE PAST OF THREE YEARS SO FAR EXPENDITURES SO. LIMON A FEW ITEMS SO I SEE KEEP ARTS A IN SCHOOL REFUND THAT THAT IS SO. LOWEST OF FUNDING AND THEN I THINK OF TIPPING OFF SCHOOL WHIMS IN SPORTS IS A VERY VERY. IMPORTANT. AND DAY IN MY. THE DISTRICT AREA. WHERE I'M MORE COMFORTABLE UNDERSTANDING DOES THE OR THE PROGRAM SO OFF PROGRAM SO IN THE CITY OF IRVINE? IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT OUT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDING. DISTRUST OR SUPPORTED ARTS PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTED A FROM THE YEAR. PROFIT UP FOUNDATION FUND RAISING RECORD FUND OF FOUNDATION FUND RAISING EFFORTS UP I ONE DAY FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS SO WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. IN NOW MORE FUNDING FOR THIS TO SCHOOL. POSSIBLE WHIMS RIGHT. CAN I AM SO THE KEY PARTS IN SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE VOLUNTARY TAX A CHECK OFF OF FUND SO THAT IS THE YOU KNOW TAX FUN AND THAT WE HAVE AND WE. LAST YEAR WE HAD SOME CHALLENGES WITH OUR. THE TURBO TAX. MESSAGING SO WAS A LITTLE BIT OF DEPTH THAT'S BEEN CORRECTED SO WE WILL BE CONTINUING TO. TO GO OUT AND GET REVENUES FROM THAT FUND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT FUNDING THAT WE CONTINUE OUR ROBUST MARKETING OF THAT BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER. YOU KNOW A COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE TO DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING DAYS BUT OUR ARTS EDUCATION. ARE GRANT PORTFOLIO HAS ONLY BEEN EXPANDED WE'VE EXPANDED IT FROM ARTS IN SCHOOL TO ART AFTER SCHOOL AND BEFORE SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND IN ADDITION THIS LAST YEAR. WE HAVE AN ARTS EXPOSURE PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROGRAM TO OFFER I'M LOW INCOME ITS STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOLS OPPORTUNITIES TO GO TO ART EXHIBITS AND ARTS PRESENTATIONS. SO OUR ACTUAL ARTS GRANTS PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXPANDED AND WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF UNMET NEED THERE THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF INCREASED APPLICATIONS AND. YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE OF OUR FUNDING RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING STILL OF A LARGE PERCENTAGE THAT GO UNFUNDED. BEARD LARGEST EXPENDITURE CUT THE WARRIORS SO. WHAT ARE OBVIOUSLY GENERAL FUND ABOUT THAT THE OTHER ONE IS? THE. NO REIMBURSEMENT THE ARE EIGHT OVER EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO IS THIS A GRANT APPLICATION ON LOCAL BASIS RIGHT SO OUR REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM COMES THROUGH GENERAL FUND FROM THE SKY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF. CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION SO IT'S GENERAL FUND THAT GOES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND COMES TO US THEIR INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT REIMBURSEMENT SO IT'S IT'S A VCR GENERAL FUNDS THAT COME TO THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. FOR US TO RUN OUR ARTS IN CORRECTIONS IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR GRANTS PROGRAM FEELS ARE ALL CAO. CONTRACTED PROGRAMMING THAT IS DOING THE WORK OF CDC ARE IN THE INSTITUTIONS IN THE EYE AND THE ADULT. AND INSTITUTIONS. WITHIN CDC ARE SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAT'S OUR REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS NOT RELATED TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WHICH IS THE FIVE MINUTE MILLION DOLLAR ARGUMENT TO OUR GRANTS PROGRAM THAT'S. THE DIFFERENT CEREMONY. I WONDER. IF UP ASSEMBLYMAN TRUE. THE AREAS A HOLIDAY AND MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL IT CAN. ADDITIONAL FUNDING THE HOSTESS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED. I I I THINK DELEON A WILL CAN JUST CONTINUE REACHING OUT TO YOU KNOW SERVING THE RULER AREAS. ON THE VETERANS SENATE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY AS WELL AS TO SCHOOL CHILDREN AND CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES SO BUT BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I OF ALL WE WILL. PUBLIC BE IT GET ALL WILL GET INVOLVED WITH THE PLANNING AFTER WE KNOW DATA MONIES COMMENT I MEAN WHAT RIGHT NOW I I GUESS MY QUESTION LAST A WITH A TEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS A JUSTIFIED THAT BECAUSE OF. THE. OF FROM THE EXPERIENCE WHAT THROUGH APPLICATIONS AT THAT DOWN THE NUMBER WAS TO DEFINE GO OR ONCE IT GOT TEN MILLION ORGANIZED TO ADD TO MORE OR WHAT WAS IT JULY OF MENTAL NOTE YOU KNOW I LIKE TO SEE MORE ON THE OF. THE SHIP THE VETERAN SERVICES. AN HOUR AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. SCHOOL CHILDREN AND CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. AND JR MAINLY IN GENERAL PUBLIC'S A CAN CAN YOU ELABORATE THAT WHAT THE QUESTION ORDERED FACILITIES SOMEHOW THIS ARTS PROGRAM WOULD WORK FOR THEM OWNER WILL HELP A LOT OF TO. THE PEOPLE THAT GO INTO. THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES TO A TO EDUCATE THEM AND TAKE. TO HELP THEM ILL DEVELOP SOME SKILL AND APPRECIATION OF ART AND AND. OUR THE TYPE PROBABLY HELP IN THIS DO. REPORT AS WELL SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO START MY BURIED ON THEIR. BLOG EXACTLY WOULD DO IN THE CLERK CORRECTIONAL FACILITY I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON ABOUT THAT I. ARE IT'S A POWERFUL PROGRAM IN ARTS IN CORRECTIONS IT DOESN'T. SIMPLY TEACH APPRECIATE FOR SHIZHEN FOR THE ARTS IT DOWN IT TEACHES. I WAS ONCE A PRISONERS BUT THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE I'M IN AGREEMENT TO INMATES. IT HOW TO DEVELOP EMPATHY. HOW TO EXPRESS EMOTION AND HOW IT HOW TO INTERACT ON A TEAM BUT IT HOW? IT GIVES THEM A. INTERPERSONAL SKILLS THAT ARE NOT BEING DEVELOPED WHILE THEY'RE IN. THE YARD THICK AND ACTUALLY CHANGES THE NATURE OF WHAT GOES ON IN THE YARD IN IT BECOMES CLOSER TO. A COMMUNITY THAT THEY WILL REENTER INTO ONCE AGAIN OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON. SO THEY'RE TRANSFERABLE SKILLS THAT ARE TAUGHT THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS SO THIS WAY I'M GOING TO PUT PUBLIC COMMENT IN WHICH THERE BECOMES OUT OF IN THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CHRIS ATCHISON SHELTER ABOUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ARTS ADVOCATES JUST OBVIOUSLY ONE THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR INCLUDING THIS MAY REVISE BUT ALSO AN ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP THAT'S BEEN SHOWN BY THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OF THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU.

THE NEXT MOVE ON TO OUR LAST ITEM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING LOCAL ASSISTANCE GOOD MORNING AGAIN TOOK SOME IT'S DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION REQUEST TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION REQUEST IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FIRST COUNTY CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS FOR PROPERTY TAX LOSSES. RESULTING FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES AND RESULTANT MONTHS FLIGHTS THIS WOULD MAKE A TOTAL PREPARATION THIRTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION. THE FINAL PROPERTY TAX LOSS ESTIMATES INDICATE TWENTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR THE SEVEN COUNTIES NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND ELEVEN MILLION FOR THE FIVE COUNTIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH C. SACK IN THE COUNTY OTHER CONTROLLERS TO CLICK THE LOSS ESTIMATES. WE NOTE THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO AUTHORIZE THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OF PROPERTY TAX LOSSES. IF THE AMOUNT APPROPRIATED IS INSUFFICIENT TO BACKFILL ACTUAL LOSSES AT THIS TIME I'D BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. I DO HAVE A QUESTION ACTUALLY IS RESOURCES ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY THE FIRES. PLEASE PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW ALLOCATIONS WERE DETERMINED. WE WERE WE WERE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY OTHER CONTROLLERS WHO WORK WITH THEIR OWN COUNTY ASSESSOR'S. AND THEY'D LOOK AT THE THE ACTUAL PARCELS THAT WERE DAMAGED BY THE FIRE OR THE MUDSLIDES AND THE ASSESSORS. PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO COME OUT OUR CONTROLLERS AND THEY'VE. I RELAYED THE INFORMATION TO US SO IT'S ACTUAL COUNTY WORK. THAT DATA GAVE US THAT THE ACTUAL ESTIMATES THANK YOU ELLIOTT. ONE THING THAT WE WOULD HAVE ASSEMBLY HIGHLIGHT IS THAT. AND THAT WE INCLUDED IN THE BROADER AYE RESPONSE THE WILDFIRES EARLIER IN THE BUDGET SEASON. IS THAT AT THE MOMENT THE STATE. IS IN A FINANCIAL POSITION TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY BACK FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOSSES. I AS A RESULT OF THESE WILDFIRES HOWEVER IN THE FUTURE THE STATE MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THE SAME SORT OF THING. AND LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THERE ARE CRITERIA BY WHICH TO DO TODAY THEIR CRITERIA BY WHICH TO DETERMINE WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD RECEIVE. FROM A BACK FILL IN WHAT PROPORTION OVER WHAT I'M TIME PERIOD. AS AN EXAMPLE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE MY MORE EASILY RECOVER IN TERMS OF REBUILDING THE PROPERTY IS WHERE AS OTHERS THERE MIGHT USE A SIGNIFICANT LAG. PARTICULARLY IN FUTURE. DISASTERS AND WE WERE JUST HIGHLIGHT THIS ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR CHOI. YEAH READING HERE. THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET. IS SO FOR WHAT OVER TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO FULL ON IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE OF FIVE RELATED POP TO TEXAN LOSSES OF BECAUSE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ROSI'S Y. ON NO ONE AT THAT TIME. THAT'S A VERY STRANGE RIGHT AFTER THE FIRE I DUTY INDIA TOUR OF THAT THAT DAMAGED AREAS. THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY I COULD TELL HOW MANY HOMES WERE DAMAGED. NEW Y. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS ARE NOT THE MORE DAMAGES WHAT DONE AND THEN JUST WERE. ASSESSED. AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF DAMAGES ARE INSTALLING CALIFORNIA ONE NOT PROCESSED. VERY STRANGE. WHEN WE DEVELOPED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WAS BACK IN DECEMBER. AND A LOT OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ASSESSORS HAD HAD GONE HADN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY GO OUT AND ACTUALLY ASSESS THE DAMAGE AT THAT TIME WHO HAS TO PULL OUT THE ARE UNCLEAR. THE UP WAS JEFF HEY OUT LOGICALLY AND TEN OR SO ARE. DE AFFECTED AREA THAT IN THAT AREA I SAW ANAHEIM FILES ONLY T.. A FIRE DEPARTMENT IDEA TO OUR MAJOR AUTHORITIES WAS HALF A AMEND THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROPERTY DAMAGE YOU SAID THEY SELF AT THAT TIME. IT TAKES AWHILE WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY HAVE TO GO ON WITH GOD EXTEND IT TOOK AWHILE FOR THE THE ASSESSORS TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED THE DAMAGE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PARCEL. IT'S NOT ON AND ON IT OVERALL AREA BASES THEY NEED TO. TO ASSESS. THAT THE PROPERTY TAX LOSSES FOR EACH EACH INDIVIDUAL ITEM EVEN TOOK THE PICTURES HE SAYS OF VERY CLEAR WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE IS ALMOST TO THE DOES THE BOND ONCE WAS APPLAUDED OFFICE RIGHT. WELL WE WE REACH OUT TO THE COUNTIES IN AND THEY HADN'T COMPILE THAT INFORMATION FORCE AT THE TIME OF OF THE CREATION OF OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE ADDED THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT THIS TIME. SO WHY SO THIS IS. ASSESSED APPEAR THAT. AND NUMBER ABA DAMAGES ASSESSED A HOW ARE YOU KNOW AUGMENT DATA. AB THAT'S THE INCLUDING A PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IF THERE'S ANY. ANY DIFFERENCE UP FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN WE BACK FIELD THE PROPERTY TAX LOSSES FOR RELATING CALAVERAS COUNTY. I IT TOOK THEM TOOK THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S AWHILE TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. AND THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF OF FAT PROPERTY TAX LOSSES FOR THOSE TWO COUNTIES. AND DATA. WE'RE GIVING OURSELVES AN EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF TIME AYE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WAS ESTIMATED IN THE ACTUAL. WILL BE ABLE TO. COMPLETELY BACKFILL PROVIDE YOU KNOW SO. ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPERTY TAX LOSSES ARE COMPLETELY REPAID AND THE COUNTIES ARE MADE WHOLE. SO EXACTLY DON'T A LOT MORE MUSCLE TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SOMEHOW WOULD THIS BE FUNDS BE YOU STE. AT THAT THE FUNDING GOES TO REDUCE THAT. THINK THE COUNTY'S MOSTLY RELY ON PROPERTY TAXES. A FURTHER FOR THE REVENUE SOURCES AND THIS WILL DON'T BE SO QUICK TO COUNTY IT WILL GO TO THE COUNTIES. CITIES AND THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ALL THREE OF THEM ARE BEING BACK FILLED FOR THEIR LOSSES. OKAY SO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. PORTION WOULD BE ADDED LATER ON ALL THE STATE'S OTHER CALPERS FROM CALIFORNIA PORTION IS ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IS ADDED IN OUR HOME.
