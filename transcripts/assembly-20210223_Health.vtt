00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:29.827
ARRANGEMENT WITH THEM. NEXT

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:32.597
SLIDE. A LITTLE BIT OF

00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:34.365
BACKGROUND BUT HE C. H. P. WE

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:36.200
ACTUALLY WERE ESTABLISHED AS A

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:37.468
CALIFORNIA TELL HEALTH POLICY

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:39.036
ORGANIZATION IN TWO THOUSAND

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:39.737
AND NINE AS A PROGRAM

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:40.738
UNDERNEATH THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:43.040
INSTITUTE. BUT WE APPLIED FOR A

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:44.742
GRANT THROUGH HER SINCE TWO

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:45.276
THOUSAND TWELVE BECOME THE

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:46.410
FEDERALLY DESIGNATED NATIONAL

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:47.845
TELEHEALTH POLICY RESEARCH

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:48.913
CENTER WE'VE BEEN SERVING IN

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.882
THAT CAPACITY EVER SENSE. WE

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:51.883
WORK WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:53.518
FUNDERS AND PARTNERS ON THE

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:54.619
STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL ON

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:56.954
TELEHEALTH PROJECTS. AND PAPERS

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:58.689
AND RESEARCH WE ALSO ACT AS THE

00:35:58.756 --> 00:35:59.657
MINISTRY FOR THE NATIONAL

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:01.292
CONSORTIUM TELEHEALTH RESOURCE

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.760
CENTER. AND WE ARE COMING HERE

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:03.794
FOR THE CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:05.930
POLICY COALITION WHICH IS A

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.365
COALITION OF OVER ONE HUNDRED

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:08.766
STATEWIDE GROUPS THAT ARE

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:11.402
INTERESTED IN TELEHEALTH POLICY

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.337
FOR THE STATE. NEXT SLIDE. AND

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:16.707
NEXT SLIDE. SO I WANTED TO

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:18.242
BEGIN WITH WHAT EXACTLY IS

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.044
TELEHEALTH AS THE DEFINITION

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:21.646
DOES VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.281
JURISDICTION AND SOMETIMES A

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:24.215
TERM TELEHEALTH AND

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:25.816
TELEMEDICINE ARE USED

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.919
INTERCHANGEABLY BASICALLY THE

00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:30.221
BASICS OF TELEHEALTH IS THAT IT

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:32.690
IS THE USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY TO

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:34.025
PROVIDE SERVICES WHEN THE

00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:34.825
PARTIES ARE IN DIFFERENT

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:36.561
LOCATIONS THAT'S ITS MOST BASIC

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:38.963
DEFINITION THAT'S OUT THERE

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.431
EACH JURISDICTION DOES HAVE A

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:42.333
DIFFERENT DEFINITION FOR IT-

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.267
BUT THOSE ELEMENTS ARE

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:45.069
BASICALLY THE SAME CALIFORNIA

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:47.038
HAS A FAIRLY BROAD DEFINITION

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:48.406
FOR TELEHEALTH AND THAT WAS

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:50.708
INTENTIONAL WHEN THE DEFINITION

00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:51.208
WAS CHANGED BACK IN TWO

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:52.977
THOUSAND AND ELEVEN- THE BROAD

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.378
DEFINITION THAT EXIST FOR

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:55.513
TELEHEALTH IN CURRENT.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.982
CALIFORNIA LAW IS TO ENSURE

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:00.151
THAT IT IS ABLE TO DEVELOP AND

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:02.053
GROW WITH HOW TECHNOLOGY

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:03.421
INVOLVES AS WE ALL KNOW

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:05.389
TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES AT A PRETTY

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.925
RAPID RATE SO THE UP OPPONENTS

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:09.860
FOR TEL HELP BACK IN TWO

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:10.361
THOUSAND ELEVEN AND THE

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:12.163
LEGISLATURE THAT WANTED TO MAKE

00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:14.031
SURE THAT THE LAW THAT WAS

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:15.266
EXISTENCE DEFINITION FOR

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:17.134
TELEHEALTH WAS ABLE TO EXPAND

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:20.237
AND GROW WITH THOSE CHANGES

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:20.871
THAT TAKE PLACE FOR TECHNOLOGY.

00:37:20.938 --> 00:37:24.275
NEXT SLIDE. SO THERE ARE

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:25.576
ESSENTIALLY WHEN WE WERE

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:27.645
THINKING OF PRE HELD THAT FOR

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:29.747
MODALITIES TO TELL HEALTH AND I

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:30.781
WOULD BE USING THESE TERMS

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:32.950
THROUGHOUT THE- TESTIMONY AND I

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.585
THINK PROBABLY THE OTHER PEOPLE

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:35.720
WHO WOULD TESTIFY WILL BE USING

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.521
AS WELL SO IT'S GOOD TO JUST

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:39.090
SORT OF SET THIS TO MAKE SURE

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.124
EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:41.726
TERMS YOU'RE THINKING MISTER

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.227
LIVE VIDEO WHICH IS BASICALLY

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.495
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW TO REAL

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:47.264
TIME INTERACTION. BETWEEN THE

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:48.265
TWO PARTIES WERE IN DIFFERENT

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:50.935
LOCATIONS STOURPORT THAT'S THE

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.269
CAPTURE OF INFORMATION AND

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:53.704
SENDING IT TRANSMITTING IT TO

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:55.640
THE SECOND PARTY IT DOES NOT

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:56.941
TAKE PLACE IN REAL TIME SO AN

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.676
EXAMPLE IS IF SOMEBODY HAS A

00:37:58.743 --> 00:37:59.977
SKIN CONDITION THEY'RE SEEING A

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.479
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER THE

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:03.180
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER IS NOT

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.815
QUITE CERTAIN WHAT EXACTLY THAT

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:06.183
IS THEY TAKE A PICTURE OF IT

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.752
AND THEY SEND IT TO A

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:09.487
DERMATOLOGIST WHO WILL EVALUATE

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.022
IT AND LOOK AT IT LATER AND

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:13.724
SEND THEIR OWN DIAGNOSIS OR

00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:14.892
FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS LATER ON.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.193
BERMEL PATIENT MARK TREES

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.928
CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF A

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.063
PATIENT'S CONDITION FOR A

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.264
PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT CAN

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:21.866
TAKE PLACE IN REAL TIME WE'RE

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:24.135
NOT IN REAL TIME SO A REAL TIME

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:26.137
EXAMPLE IS THINK OF AN ICU UNIT

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:27.805
THE INTENSE OF THIS MAY NOT BE

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.373
ON LOCATION AT THAT MOMENT WITH

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.775
THE PATIENT BUT THE MARGIN THE

00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:31.909
PATIENT FOR A DIFFERENT

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:32.777
LOCATION AND TRANSMITTING

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:34.478
INSTRUCTIONS TO HEALTHCARE

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:35.646
PERSONNEL WHO ARE PHYSICALLY

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:37.548
WITH THE PATIENT THAT'S TAKING

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:39.383
PLACE IN REAL TIME. AND NON

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.719
REAL TIME EXAMPLE IS A PATIENT

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.354
WHO HAS HYPERTENSION AND THAT

00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:44.455
IS BEING MONITORED BY THEIR

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:45.489
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THE

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:47.358
PATIENT IS TAKING READINGS

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:48.426
LET'S SAY DAILY READINGS AT

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:49.994
HOME AND TRANSMITTING THEM TO

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.162
THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WHO

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:52.830
AGAIN IS NOT LOOKING AT HIM AS

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:53.764
THEY'RE COMING IN BUT MAYBE

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.466
LOOKING AT IT THE END OF THE

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:56.500
WEEK AT THE END THE DAY AT A

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:58.836
LATER TIME. AND IT IS REALLY

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:02.139
JUST THE USAGE OF SOME SORT OF

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:04.542
DEVICE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SOME

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.243
OF THE SERVICES THAT USE ONE OF

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.612
THE OTHER MODALITY SO A LAPTOP

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:10.748
OR SMARTPHONE OR IPAD IS

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:11.649
USUALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:15.619
FAMILIAR WITH THIS USUALLY.

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:16.220
TAKING PLACE OVER APPS. THERE

00:39:16.287 --> 00:39:18.723
ANOTHER. THAT IS. THAT INCLUDES

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:22.226
TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGY BUT IT IS

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.561
NOT CONSIDER TELEHEALTH AT

00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:25.162
LEAST IN MEDICARE'S AYE IN

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:27.131
CMS'S SIDE. AND THAT'S CALL

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:28.499
COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY BASED

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.800
SERVICES AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.836
BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AT BECAUSE

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:34.438
WHEN COVERED HIT. THE CHIU SORT

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:36.941
OF GOT VERY MUDDLED TOGETHER-

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:38.342
BUT IT IS A TERM THAT'S BEEN

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:39.677
COINED BY MEDICARE BUT IT'S

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:42.313
SLOWLY BEEN SEEPING INTO POLICY

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.081
BOTH ON THE STATE LEVEL. AND

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:47.017
AMONG COMMERCIAL PAYERS AS WELL

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:50.221
SO NEXT SLIDE. SO MEDICARE

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:53.090
POLICY- IT IS ACTUALLY BEFORE

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:55.259
COBIT NINETEEN IT WAS ONE OF

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.460
THE MOST RESTRICTIVE TELL

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:58.696
HEALTH POLICIES IN THE NATION-

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:00.164
IT COMPARED TO A LOT OF STATES

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:02.166
IN THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS-

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.734
WHAT COMMERCIALS REPAIRS DOING.

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.636
MEDICARE I WAS VERY LIMITED IN

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:07.138
WHAT THEY ALLOW TELEHEALTH

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:08.639
SHOULD BE UTILIZED FOR IN PART

00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:09.774
OF THAT A BIG PART OF THAT IS

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.075
BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE TELL

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.910
HAVE LIMITATIONS. ARE IN

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:15.412
FEDERAL STATUTES SO CMS CAN

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:17.481
ONLY DO SO MUCH IN ORDER TO

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:18.549
ALLOW THE UTILIZATION OF

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:20.251
TELEHEALTH WITHOUT CONGRESS

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:22.186
ACTING. SO WITH THOSE

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.721
LIMITATIONS ON THERE A COUPLE

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:25.523
YEARS AGO BACK AROUND

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:27.691
200-015-2000 SIXTEEN REALIZING

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:29.627
THAT THE OTHER MODALITIES THAT

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.796
COULD BE UTILIZED BUT- THEY

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:33.664
WERE UNABLE TO ALLOW FOR THEM

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.399
TO MEET THE MEDICARE PROGRAM

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:36.133
UNLESS THERE WAS A STATUTORY

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.337
CHANGE. CMS CREATED A BUCKET

00:40:40.404 --> 00:40:42.773
FOR ANOTHER CHANNEL OF SERVICES

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.008
THAT THEY CALL COMMUNICATIONS

00:40:44.074 --> 00:40:46.010
TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES. NOW

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.812
THESE SERVICES WE USE ALL THE

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:48.746
MODALITIES OF TELEHEALTH THAT I

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.681
JUST COVERED INCLUDING AUDIO

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:53.784
ONLY FOUND TO DELIVER SERVICES.

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.452
BUT THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:57.388
UNDER MEDICARE'S EYES AS

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.589
TELEHEALTH THERE THIS OTHER

00:40:58.656 --> 00:41:00.191
CATEGORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:01.659
TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:02.660
UTILIZE TELEHEALTH

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:04.728
TECHNOLOGIES. BUT THEY ARE NOT

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:05.996
CONSIDER TELEHEALTH AND HOW

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:07.598
MEDICARE HOW CMS ADMINISTERS

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.834
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. WHAT THAT

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.068
MEANS THEN IS THERE THEY'RE

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.370
ABLE TO COVER THE SERVICES THAT

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:14.138
ARE DELIVERED THROUGH

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:15.506
TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES BUT

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:16.574
BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONSIDER

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.677
TELEHEALTH. THEY ARE RESTRICTED

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:20.811
BY WHAT'S IN FEDERAL LAW SO

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.879
THEY CAN SET UP THEIR OWN

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.214
POLICIES OF WHO CAN RECEIVE THE

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.949
SERVICE THIS IS. HOW THE

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:27.384
SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AND WHAT

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:31.689
PROVIDERS PROVIDE THE SERVICES.

00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:33.691
NEXT SLIDE. A LOT OF THE POLICY

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:35.659
AROUND TELEHEALTH IS AROUND

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:36.894
REIMBURSEMENT A LOT OF THE

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:39.296
EXISTING SPECIFIC POLICY- OUT

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:40.965
THERE AND THAT'S TRUE FOR BOTH

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.366
ON THE FEDERAL STATE LEVEL NOT

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:43.634
ALL POLICY THERE ARE OTHER

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:44.668
THINGS THAT IMPACT TELL HELP

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:46.403
OBVIOUSLY SUGGEST PRESCRIBING

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.138
LAWS LICENSING LAWS. BUT A LOT

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:49.907
OF THE ESTABLISHED PARTIALLY IS

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.208
AROUND REIMBURSEMENT LIKE GETS

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:53.043
PAID YOU KNOW WHO'S COVERED

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.645
WHAT TYPE OF PROVIDED PROVIDE

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.580
SERVICES. AND REIMBURSEMENT

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:58.716
POLICY ITSELF IS. BECAUSE

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.284
BASICALLY FOUR BASIC ELEMENTS

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.552
AND HOW IT'S MADEUP YOU HAVE

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.153
THE SERVICE THE LOCATION AMONG

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.622
THE ALLEY IN THE PROVIDER SO

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:07.892
FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT SEE A

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.026
MEDICAID. POLICY THAT SAYS. THE

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:10.294
MEDICAID PROGRAM WILL COVER OF

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.729
MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.530
SERVICES WHEN THE PATIENT IS

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:15.165
LOCATED IN A CLINIC OR A

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.834
DOCTOR'S OFFICE WHEN IT'S

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.402
DELIVERED VIA LIVE VIDEO AND

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:19.603
IT'S BEING DELIVERED BY A

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.438
PSYCHIATRIST. SO THOSE ARE YOUR

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:22.573
SORT OF BASIC ELEMENTS ABOUT

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.508
REIMBURSEMENT POLICY AND WHERE

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:26.443
YOU SAW A LOT OF THE POLICY

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.112
CHANGES THAT WERE MADE ITS

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:29.813
RESPONSE TO COVER THAT. NEXT

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:35.085
SLIDE. SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE AS

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:37.288
YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A HUNDRED

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:38.289
THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL OVER VIEW

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:40.624
OF WHATPOLICY CHANGES TOOK

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:42.059
PLACE DURING COVERT NINETEEN

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:43.560
AND THE ISSUE AREA IN WHICH

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.462
BOTH MEDICARE LOOKED AT AND

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:46.630
MEDICAID PROGRAMS LOOK AT

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:48.499
NATIONALLY. REALLY VERY VERY

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:50.100
SIMILAR TYPE OF MODALITY THE

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:51.869
TYPE LOCATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:53.771
LOCATED ON THE SERVICE TO PLACE

00:42:53.837 --> 00:42:54.438
THE TYPE OF PROVIDERS WHO

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:57.207
ALLOWED TO. UTILIZE IT. OTHER

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:59.310
POLICIES THAT IMPACT HOW

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.744
TELEHEALTH IS BEING USED

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:01.912
AGAINST SOME OF THE PRESCRIBING

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:03.013
POLICIES WHICH IS UNDERNEATH

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.015
THE A AND ALSO PRIVACY AND

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.284
SECURITY- PROTECTION SUCH AS

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:08.752
HELPED BY A PRIVACY AND

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.321
SECURITY LAWS. SO THERE ARE

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:11.855
CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE ENACTED

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.490
IN ALL THESE AREAS BUT THE

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.192
MAJORITY OF THE CHANGES RELATED

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.193
FOCUSING ON THOSE

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.129
REIMBURSEMENT. ISSUES THAT'S

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:22.733
LIFE. SO CALIFORNIA POLICIES SO

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.735
IN COMPARISON TO MEDICARE

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.971
BEFORE COVERED NINETEEN. MEDI

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:28.572
CAL IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:29.640
OFFENSE MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:31.375
AND HOW THEY HANDLE TELEHEALTH

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.177
SO MEDICARE HAD VERY STRICT

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:34.611
RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE THE

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:35.846
PATIENT WAS LOCATED THEIR

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:36.981
GEOGRAPHICAL INSIGHT

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.983
LIMITATIONS MEDIKAL. DID NOT

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:40.017
HAVE ANY GEOGRAPHICAL

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:41.352
LIMITATIONS AND FOR THE MOST

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:44.054
pLOCATIONS UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:44.888
ABOUT COMMITTEE HEALTH CLINICS

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:47.424
LIKE A FEW AGENCIES. OR RURAL

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:48.959
HEALTH CLINICS. THERE WERE

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.995
LIMITATIONS ON THERE BECAUSE OF

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.730
HOW THEY'RE STRUCTURED AND SOME

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:53.964
OF THE POLICIES THAT APPLY TO

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:55.766
THEM. THE MODALITY THAT WAS

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.368
BEING IS A MEDICARE YOU'RE

00:43:57.434 --> 00:43:58.569
ESSENTIALLY LIMITED TO LIVE

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.237
VIDEO THERE'S THIS SLIGHT

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.439
EXCEPTION FOR THOSE IN HAWAII

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:02.940
AND ALASKA WHERE THEY'RE

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.875
ALLOWED TO STORE FOR. FOR MEDIC

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:07.478
HOW THEY ALLOW THE PROVIDER TO

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:09.346
DECIDE WHICH ANALOGY YEARS.

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:10.280
THEY COULD USE EITHER LIVE

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.416
VIDEO STORE FOR AND IF IT WAS A

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:14.184
SERVICE THAT WAS PROVIDED BY A

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.652
COVERED BY MEDICARE OUT

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.154
TYPICALLY IF YOU WHEN YOU

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:18.522
DELIVER THE SERVICE AND PERCENT

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:20.491
AND THERE WAS NO OTHER. FACTOR

00:44:20.557 --> 00:44:21.825
THAT WOULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM

00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:23.761
USING TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS AN IN

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.295
PERSON ALAMAT TO THE SERVICE

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.830
THEN THE PROVIDED COULD SELECT

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.565
WHICH MODALITY USE FROM LIVE

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:30.834
VIDEO OR STAR FOR. SERVICES

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.403
AGAIN AND THERE IS REALLY NOT

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:33.270
LIKE A LIMITATION ON THAT AS

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.138
LONG AS IT WAS COVERED IN A

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:35.773
REQUIRE LIKE A PERSON ELEMENT

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.908
OR HAD SOME OTHER TYPE OF.

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:38.375
RESTRICTION TO USING

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.811
TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN PROVIDERS

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:42.112
AND PROVIDERS WAS A PRETTY

00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.847
BROAD LESS- THEY ALSO DID

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:45.783
INCLUDE FQHCS IN OUR SEASONING

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:47.051
IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AS A

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:49.253
PROVIDER. OF TELEHEALTH THOUGH

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.254
THERE THEY DID HAVE SOME

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.156
LIMITATIONS SO WHEN COMPARED TO

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:54.024
MEDICARE MEDIC HOW IT WAS

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.325
ACTUALLY PRETTY BROAD IT WAS

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:56.393
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.995
PROGRESSIVE POLICIES OUT THERE

00:44:58.062 --> 00:44:59.363
WHEN YOU COMPARED TO OTHER

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.864
STATES. NOW THIS WAS ALL PRE

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:02.466
COVERED NINETEEN AND ACTUALLY

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.468
SET CALIFORNIA UP IN A PRETTY

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:10.707
GOOD POSITION WHEN THE PANDEMIC.

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:11.775
CARE ACT. NEXT SLIDE. AND THIS

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:13.277
IS JUST OF A ABYSS FORTY AS YOU

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:14.878
SEE KNOW MEDIC. VERY LIMITED IN

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.280
WHAT THEY DO MEDICARE WAS MUCH

00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:18.382
MORE EXPANSIVE. I'M THAT JUST

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.149
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA THE

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.485
MEDICARE POLICIES ARE REALLY

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.153
ABOUT TWO DECADES AGO THEY THE

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.488
LAST TIME THERE WAS A MAJOR

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.824
UPDATE AND FEDERAL STATUTE TO

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:27.858
THE MEDICARE POLICIES FOR

00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:29.326
TELEHEALTH. WAS BACK IN THE

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.861
YEAR TWO THOUSAND THERE BEEN

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:32.429
LIKE SMALL UPDATES OVER THE

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:34.398
YEARS BUT THE LAST MAJOR CHANGE

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:36.066
WAS IN TWO THOUSAND. COMPARED

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:37.534
TO MEDICARE OUT WHICH ACTUALLY

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:38.669
UPDATED THEIR TELEHEALTH

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:41.205
POLICIES IN THE SUMMER OF TWO

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.106
THOUSAND NINETEEN SO JUST A FEW

00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:43.607
MONTHS BEFORE CALVET HECK.

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:47.177
THAT'S LIFE. SO THIS IS JUST AN

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:48.445
OVERVIEW OF WHAT THEY DID

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:50.147
AGAIN- WENT OVER ON THE OTHER

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:52.049
SIDE A COUPLE OTHER THINGS TO

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:53.417
KEEP IN MIND ON WHAT GOES ON

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:54.718
WITH CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.687
POLICY IS THAT THERE ARE. OTHER

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:58.122
REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS A MEANS TO

00:45:58.188 --> 00:45:59.556
BE AN ORAL OR WRITTEN CONSENT

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:01.992
THAT IS STATUTORY. ALSO BEFORE

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:03.861
THE PANDEMIC HIT- THIS IS

00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:05.295
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL GORE CURRY'S

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:06.897
BILL AB SEVEN FOUR FOUR JUST

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:08.398
PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:10.100
THAT IMPACTED COMMERCIAL PAIRS.

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:11.368
WHICH REQUIRE COMMERCIAL PAYERS

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.269
TO COVER TELEHEALTH DELIVERY

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:13.570
SERVICES THE SAME WAY THEY

00:46:13.637 --> 00:46:15.072
WOULD HAVE BEEN PERCENT AND PAY

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.373
THE SAME AMOUNT. THOUGH THAT

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.041
WOULD NOT KICK IN UNTIL JANUARY

00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:19.576
FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:21.044
IT IS IN EFFECT NOW BUT THAT

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.579
WAS NOT WHAT WE HAD GOING INTO

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:24.581
THE PANDEMIC. AND THE LICENSURE

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:26.483
CALIFORNIA IS NOT VERY

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.551
DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:28.919
STATES AND THAT. YOU ARE

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.220
REQUIRED TO GET A CALIFORNIA

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.221
LICENSE IN ORDER PROVIDE

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:32.322
CALIFORNIA SERVICE START

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:34.491
SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:37.694
OUR CALVET PEOPLE LOCATING

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.263
CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:40.164
WERE THE CHANGES MADE IN

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.266
RESPONSE TO KOBE AS I SAID.

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:43.233
HELPER WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.968
GOOD POSITION GOING INTO CALVET

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:46.670
WHETHER TELEHEALTH POLICY BUT

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:47.771
THEY DID NEED TO MAKE SOME

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.139
CHANGES IN THE FIRST BIG ONE

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:51.175
WAS AROUND MODALITY. I SAID

00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:52.709
THAT THEY WERE. IN THE NEED THE

00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:53.443
MEDICARE PROGRAM THEY'RE

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.112
ALLOWED TO USE STORE FOR AND

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:57.748
LIVE VIDEO- BUT THE BIG THING

00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:59.683
ARE MERGED OF PUFFIN NINETEEN

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.251
WAS THE REALIZATION THAT. WHILE

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:03.220
TELEHEALTH COULD. BE AN

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:05.088
EFFECTIVE TOOL A VERY VITAL

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:07.291
TOOL DURING THE PANDEMIC NOT

00:47:07.357 --> 00:47:08.592
EVERYBODY HAD ACCESS TO IT FOR

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.194
A VARIETY OF REASONS PERHAPS

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.228
THEY DIDN'T HAVE BROADBAND

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:12.863
ACCESS TO DIDN'T HAVE EQUIPMENT

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.298
OR MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.465
DIGITAL LITERACY IN ORDER TO

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:17.568
USE. OF THE TELEHEALTH A

00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:19.002
PLATFORM IN WHICH YOU KNOW THEY

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.636
WERE TRYING TO REACH THE

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:21.572
SERVICES. SO BY ONE OF FEDERAL

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:23.073
AND STATE LEVEL AUDIO ONLY

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.509
PHONE WAS ALLOWED AS- OPTION IN

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:26.910
ORDER TO RECEIVE SERVICES AND

00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:28.078
THAT WAS AN ADJUSTMENT THAT

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:29.546
MEDICAL HAVE TO MAKE AS WELL.

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:33.217
BASICALLY LIKE EVERYBODY. ELSE

00:47:33.283 --> 00:47:35.619
DID. NOT CITE. SERVICE IS NOT

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.087
REALLY A LOT THE CALIFORNIA HOW

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:38.255
DID YOU RESPOND TO COVERED

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:39.890
EXCEPT TO EXPAND THEM ALLOW-

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.425
SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS. THAT

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:43.560
WERE ON FQHCS AN ARCH USED TO

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:45.062
PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES SO.

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:47.598
THAT WAS ONE CHANGE THAT HAD TO

00:47:47.664 --> 00:47:51.368
BE DONE NEXT SLIDE. AND THEN

00:47:51.435 --> 00:47:53.637
FOR LOCATION AGAIN REALLY NOT

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:55.272
MUCH OF AN ISSUE FOR MEDIC HELP

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.974
GENERAL EXCEPT WHEN YOU ARE

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.242
TALKING ABOUT THAT WORK ON THAT

00:47:58.308 --> 00:47:59.509
HEALTH CENTERS RURAL HEALTH

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:01.245
CLINICS THEY HAD TO HAVE SOME

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:02.212
OF THEIR LIMITATIONS BE LEFT

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.715
THAT. PRE COVER NINETEEN THEY

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:07.384
WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:08.952
SERVICES WHEN THE PATIENT WAS.

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:09.820
IN THE HOME UNLESS THEY WERE

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.822
HOMELESS HOMEBOUND OR MIGRATORY

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:12.923
WORKERS SO THEY WERE VERY

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.057
LIMITED IN WHAT SERVICES THEY

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:15.892
COMPRISE OUTSIDE OF LIKE THEIR

00:48:15.959 --> 00:48:17.861
CLINIC WALLS. THAT LIMITATION

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:20.697
WAS LIFTED IN RESPONSE TO HELP

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:22.299
THE- NEXT SLIDE. IN THE

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:24.368
PROVIDERS AGAIN NOT REALLY MUCH

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:26.336
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO SO.

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:27.804
SO CALIFORNIANEXT FLIGHT

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.206
CALIFORNIA WAS ACTUALLY IN A

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:30.841
FAIRLY GOOD POSITION AS FAR AS

00:48:30.907 --> 00:48:32.743
OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM CONCERNS.

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:33.977
FOR COMMERCIAL PLANS AGAIN THEY

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:36.413
HAD AB SEVEN FOR A PASS BUT IT

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.948
HAD NOT BLIND TO THE FACT THAT

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:40.550
SO THERE WAS JUST. YEAR IN

00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:42.386
ORDER TO LIKE PUT THAT HAVE

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:44.888
THAT GO INTO A FACT. FAIRLY

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:46.923
BEFORE LIKE JANUARY FIRST

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.658
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT WAS

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:48.992
PUSH THE HAD THE TIME I WAS

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.360
PUSH THE HAD A LITTLE BIT. EVEN

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:51.261
THOUGH A LOT OF COMMERCIAL

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:52.996
PAYERS YOU KNOW TO THEIR CREDIT

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.698
DID GO FORWARD WITH A LOT OF

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.300
TOUGH- TELL HEALTH POLICIES

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:58.068
THEMSELVES AND LIKE WAIVERS IN

00:48:58.135 --> 00:48:59.303
ORDER TO ALLOW THEIR-

00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:01.171
BENEFICIARIES TO ALSO UTILIZE

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:04.708
TELEHEALTH TO. NEXT SLIDE.

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.843
OTHER THAT CROPPED UP DURING

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.578
PUBLIC NINETEEN A LOT OF THESE

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:09.846
ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SURPRISING

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:11.481
BROADBAND ISSUE PEOPLE NOT

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.817
HAVING CONNECTIVITY- LICENSURE

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:16.486
ISSUE PRIVACY AND SECURITY-

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.388
THOSE ARE. ALL ISSUES THAT WERE

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.489
BROUGHT UP IN QUESTIONS AND

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:20.590
THEY'VE ALL BEEN ISSUES THAT

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:21.725
REALLY LINGERED AROUND WITH

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:22.726
TELEHEALTH FOR AWHILE SO IF

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:23.960
YOU'VE BEEN IN TELEHEALTH THERE

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:24.961
IF THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:27.197
NEW. TO THINK THAT DID ARISE

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:28.799
DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT I

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:29.833
THINK MAY HAVE CAUGHT A FEW

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.501
PEOPLE OFF GUARD WACHTLER

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.236
OUTDATED FORMS. MECHANISMS YOU

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:34.671
CERTAINLY HAD A LOT OF NEW

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:35.706
PEOPLE USING TELEHEALTH WHO

00:49:35.772 --> 00:49:37.274
HADN'T USED IT BEFORE SO

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.376
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS- I'M NOW

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:41.812
ALLOWED TO BILL FOR TELEHEALTH.

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:43.113
BUT THE FORM THAT I TYPICALLY

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.015
USED TO GET REIMBURSEMENT. DOES

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:46.350
NOT HAVE WILL TAKE THOSE

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.685
SECTIONS IN WHICH I'M SUPPOSED

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:49.453
TO REPORT THAT I'M USING

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.088
TELEHEALTH WHAT DO I DO. SO

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:52.723
THOSE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:54.257
NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:55.158
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:56.360
ENCOUNTERED AS A RESOURCE

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:57.327
CENTER LIKE QUESTION WE WERE

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:58.295
GETTING QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE

00:49:58.362 --> 00:50:00.564
SAYING LIKE. I'M A- I'M A LONG

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:01.898
TERM CARE FACILITY I MATHIS

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:03.900
ORIGINATING SITE I DON'T KNOW

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.235
WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT THAT

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:06.403
I'M ACTING AS THAT WHAT DO I

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.804
PUT THAT CODE ON THERE SO.

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.606
OUTDATED FORMS THE MECHANISMS.

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:11.408
DIDN'T CREATE SOME PROBLEMS FOR

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:12.709
SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HADN'T

00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:14.311
HAD TO USE TELEHEALTH BEFORE SO

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:15.112
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE IN

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.013
PLACE. AND THE EDUCATION OF

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.715
PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS SO

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.217
PROVIDERS THOUGH A LITTLE LESS

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:22.219
OF THE FOR PATIENTS. THIS WAS A

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:24.121
BRAND NEW THING FOR A LOT OF

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:25.622
PATIENTS SO THIS WAS SOMETHING

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:27.324
THAT THEY- ARE NOT USED TO

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:29.126
RECEIVING SERVICES. THROUGH A

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.227
MECHANISM THAT THEY WERE

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.828
UNFAMILIAR LISTED THERE NEEDS

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:32.596
TO BE THAT OUTREACH AND

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:34.231
EDUCATION TO PATIENTS AND A LOT

00:50:34.297 --> 00:50:35.132
OF TIMES ELECTED TO THE

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.234
PROVIDERS. WHO A LOT OF THEM

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.568
WERE BRAND NEW- TRYING TO START

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:39.970
UP TELEHEALTH PROGRAM SO THEY

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:41.405
WERE JUST TRYING TO LEARN HOW

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.373
TO. DO THIS PROPERLY THEMSELVES

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.474
BUT THEY'RE ALSO TRYING TO

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.876
EDUCATE THEIR PATIENTS TO SO

00:50:45.942 --> 00:50:47.144
THAT WAS A BIT OF A STRUGGLE

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.612
THAT. I THINK SOME PEOPLE

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:54.551
ENCOUNTERED. AS WELL. THAT'S

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:55.786
LIFE. NOW I DO KNOW THAT THEIR

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:56.920
ARE- PROPOSED. CHANGES HAVE

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:58.588
BEEN BY THEM. AND ALSO DH CS

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:00.157
IT'S COME OUT FOREIGNERS THE H.

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:01.324
YES WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.559
LATER I. I'M NOT GOING TO

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:04.761
REALLY GET DEEPLY INTO IT. BUT

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.163
WE HAVE EXAMINED SOME OF THE

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:07.798
PROPOSED CHANGES AND THERE ARE

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:08.932
A COUPLE THINGS THAT I DO WANT

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:10.734
TO HIGHLIGHT THIS. I UNDERSTAND

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:12.068
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO

00:51:12.135 --> 00:51:13.103
READ BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.038
CHANGES THAT IMPACT. THE

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.673
POLICIES THAT WE HAD BEFORE

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.942
COVERED NINETEENTH ONE OF THE

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:20.544
BIG ONES IS REALLY BASICALLY

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.646
MOVING. THE STORY FORWARD

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.915
MODALITY OUT OF WHERE IT WAS

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:26.483
WHERE IT WAS AN OPTION FOR.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.386
BOTH PROVIDERS TO USE WHETHER

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:30.787
THE USE LIVE VIDEO STORE FOR IT

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:32.456
AND ALSO ALLOWING ATHLETES CC

00:51:32.522 --> 00:51:35.091
IS PART SOME STORE FOR SOME OF

00:51:35.158 --> 00:51:36.460
THEIR SERVICES. AND PUTTING IT

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.695
INTO ANOTHER. AGAIN LIKE A

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:40.363
BUCKET SIMILAR TO HOW MEDICARE

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.165
TREATS TELEHEALTH SOME OF THE

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:43.300
TELL HOPE ABOUT THESE. PUTTING

00:51:43.366 --> 00:51:45.135
IT INTO THE OTHER BUCKET OR

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:48.004
THIS OTHER CHANNEL OF SERVICES

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:50.173
OR MODALITIES. IN WHICH- NOT

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.142
ONLY WOULD STORE FOR BE LOCATED

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:53.844
BUT ALSO A REMOTE PATIENT

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.078
MARCHING THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.247
TO BE ADDED. SOMATIC HOW AUDIO

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:58.515
ONLY ANOTHER VIRTUAL

00:51:58.582 --> 00:51:59.983
TECHNOLOGIES OF USING LIKE

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.184
THESE OTHER MODALITIES THAT

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:02.853
HAVING IT SEPARATED OUT FROM

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.588
LIVE VIDEO. LIVE VIDEO WOULD

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:05.889
STILL SAY THAT ESSENTIALY THE

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.591
SAME WILL BE OPEN TO LIKE YOU

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:08.792
KNOW DIFFERENT PROVIDERS THAT

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:09.993
WOULD BE OPEN TO LIKE DIFFERENT

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.929
LOCATIONS. BUT SOME SHIP OF

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:14.097
MODALITIES INTO THIS OTHER.

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.832
AREA WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.701
THEIR OWN POLICIES ARE- THE

00:52:17.767 --> 00:52:19.703
SCHEDULES BASICALLY THEIR OWN

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:21.171
DIFFERENT WAY OF TREATING THOSE

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.240
MODALITIES. AGAIN IT SOUNDS

00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:25.175
VERY. SIMILAR AT LEAST IN ON

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:27.010
PAPER LOOKING AT IT AND FROM

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:28.612
WHAT I'VE READ SHE LEFT HOW

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:29.946
MEDICARE'S SORT OF STRUCTURE

00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:31.681
THINGS BUT- WHERE MEDICARE DID

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:34.050
THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE. LIMITED

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:35.852
BY WHAT'S IN FEDERAL STATUTE

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:36.987
THIS SEEMS TO BE LIKE A

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:38.989
CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO DO THIS- AS

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:45.529
FAR AS THE PROPOSAL'S ARM. MAY

00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:46.596
SO NEXT SLIDE. HOWEVER YOU KNOW

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:47.531
NOT ALL CHANGES FELT LIKE IT

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:48.765
WAS TAKING A STEP BACK. ARE

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.066
CHANGING SOME OF LIKE WHAT

00:52:50.133 --> 00:52:51.635
EXISTED BEFORE COVER NINETEEN

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:53.637
THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT.

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:54.804
WERE BEING KEPT AROUND LIKE

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:56.106
WITH THAT. THE TEMPERATURE

00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:57.440
CHANGES FOR SOME PROGRAMS WOULD

00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:58.708
HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO USE

00:52:58.775 --> 00:53:01.211
TELEHEALTH. THE LOCATION

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:03.246
OUTSIDE OF THE CLINIC WALLS FOR

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:04.781
FQHC SISTERS THAT THE HOME BE

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.883
ALLOWED TO BE AN ELIGIBLE PLACE

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:07.617
WHERE PATIENTS BE LOCATE

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:09.653
ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN SO THAT

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:10.520
WOULD BE STICKING AROUND AS

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:12.722
WELL TO- BUT THERE THERE WERE

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:14.357
SOME SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS FROM

00:53:14.424 --> 00:53:15.926
WHAT WE HAD BEFORE COVERED

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:17.928
NINETEEN TWO. IF THESE PROPOSED

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:21.264
CHANGES WERE TO GO INTO EFFECT

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:22.666
AS THEY ARE NOW SO NEXT SLIDE.

00:53:22.732 --> 00:53:24.034
AND THIS IS JUST SORT OF A

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.369
GRAPHIC OF IT IS THAT THERE ARE

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:27.571
SOME CHANGES THAT BEING ARE

00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:28.905
BEING KEPT OVER FROM A PRE

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.473
COVER THERE AFTER. SOME OF THE

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.474
COVER CHANGES THAT WOULD BE

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:33.076
KEPT AROUND IF THE PROPOSALS GO

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.511
FAST AND THEN SOME NEW THINGS

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:36.580
THAT THE PROPOSALS ARE ARE.

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:39.115
OFFERING SUCH AS ADDING REMOTE

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:42.319
PATIENT MONITORING. NEXT SLIDE.

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:43.486
AND I JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:44.421
REAL AT SOME OF THE OTHER

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:46.056
STATES ARE DOING AND FAR AS FAR

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:47.090
AS LIKE WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:48.892
THEIR TELEHEALTH POLICIES. SO

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:50.327
WE'RE SEEING EXPANSION FROM

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:51.428
WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE SO

00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:53.897
MASSACHUSETTS. BEFORE COVER

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:54.831
NINETEEN BASICALLY HAD VERY

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.166
LITTLE MEDICAID TELEHEALTH

00:53:56.232 --> 00:53:57.734
POLICY SO THEY ARE THEY DID

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.502
DEFINITELY EXPANDED. SOME OF

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:00.470
THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY ARE

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:01.905
DOING THAT LIKE CALIFORNIA AND

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.239
I THINK ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:04.808
WELL THERE'S- OTHER MEDICAID

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:06.743
PROGRAMS ARE STRUGGLING. TO

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:07.877
DECIDE WHAT TO DO OF AUDIO ONLY

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:10.080
PHONE. SO THEY ARE ARE LOOKING

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:11.715
AT THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE NEW

00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:13.183
JERSEY HAS INTRODUCED THE BILL

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:14.818
AT LEAST THAT REQUIRES MEDICAID

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.553
PARITY FOR TELEHEALTH INCLUDING

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.021
PHONE. WHEN IT'S COMBINED WITH

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:19.789
ASYNCHRONOUS SO THERE ARE SORT

00:54:19.856 --> 00:54:21.324
OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO HOW

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.559
YOU'RE DOING SOME OTHER STATE

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:25.061
MEDICAID PROGRAMS HAVE- ALLOW

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.229
FOR AUDIO ONLY PHONE FOR

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:28.832
CERTAIN SERVICES- OR YOU KNOW

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.634
MAYBE THERE IS A TIME OF IT IN

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.535
FOR LIKE. A COUPLE YEARS-

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:33.870
WATCHING STATE COMMERCIAL

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.372
HEALTH PLANS AS WELL AS

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.007
MEDICARE MANAGED. CARE PLANS

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:38.308
WOULD REQUIRE REVERSE FOR AUDIO

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:39.843
ONLY FOUND TO BE THE SAME AS

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:40.844
TELEMEDICINE THESE ARE

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:41.911
INTRODUCED BILLS THEY WERE JUST

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.013
INTRODUCED IN THE CURRENT

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.581
SESSION SO. WE DON'T KNOW IF

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:46.750
THEY WILL SURVIVE THE PROCESS

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:47.617
BUT THOSE ARE A COUPLE THINGS

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:49.519
THAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING.

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.054
AND I THINK THAT'S IT I THINK

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:55.625

OF INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.174
INDICATES THAT THERE'S IS NOT

QUALITY. I WANT TO POINT OUT IT

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.887
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:33.122
A TREATMENT IS NOT EFFECTIVE

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:36.726

THAT UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.869
WILL REMAIN HIGHER THAN PRE

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.926
TRACK IF. THERE WAS AN INCREASE

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.495
IN EFFICIENCIES IN APPOINTMENT

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:03.699
SETTING FOR PROVIDERS- WHAT I

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.033
MEAN BY THAT CAN MORE PEOPLE

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.936
ACTUALLY GET INTO A PROVIDER.

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:09.538
WITH TELEHEALTH BECAUSE- YOU

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.406
KNOW THAT MAY NOT BE THE DELAYS

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:13.141
THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED WITH IN

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:15.744
PERSON VISITS- DOESN'T SHORTEN

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:18.180
THE TIME. THAT PEOPLE CAN GET

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.249
IN FOR AN APPOINTMENT I MEAN I

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:22.985
RECALL OF SEVERAL TIMES TRYING

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.319
TO GET INTO A PROVIDER AND WAS

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:26.321
TOLD IT WOULD BE WEEKS MAYBE

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:27.556
EVEN MONTHS BEFORE I COULD GET

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.791
IN. HAS THERE BEEN ANY INCREASE

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:34.496
TO ACCESS. IN THAT REGARD. SURE

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:35.697
THANK YOU KNOW THAT'S A THAT'S

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:36.899
A GREAT QUESTION I THINK SOME

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:38.100
OTHER FOLKS WILL PROBABLY BE

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.701
ABLE TO SPEAK TO IT BETTER-

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:41.436
BECAUSE THEY ARE- YOU KNOW

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:42.504
WE'RE LOOKING MORE AT THE

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.106
IMPACTS OF COVERAGE. BUT

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.874
ANECDOTALLY- CERTAINLY I THINK

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:46.975
YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY MUCH ON TO

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.111
SOMETHING WHEN IT COMES TO-

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.512
THROUGHPUT AND THE CHALLENGES

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.347
OF HAVING SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND

01:15:52.414 --> 01:15:55.384
CLINIC ENVIRONMENTS. CLEANING

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.752
AND SOME OF THE OTHER-

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.387
CHALLENGES OF HAVING PROVIDERS

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:01.189
AND STAFF ON SITE AND IT-

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:02.291
CLINIC BASE LOCATIONS ARE

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.159
CLINICAL LOCATIONS. SO I THINK

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:06.261
THAT'S VERY MUCH TRUE- FROM A

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:08.430
PANDEMIC- STANDPOINT- AND

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.032
THEY'RE PROBABLY OTHER ADDITION

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:11.700
SEES PARTICULARLY WITH NO SHOW

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:14.336
RATES AND- AND SO FORTH. AND

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:15.270
THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.673
ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION- PEOPLE

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:18.840
HAVING TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.776
WORK TO ACCESS CARE AND SO

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.511
FORTH SO. YOU'RE A LOT OF AYE

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:25.480
AYE THIN COMPONENTS YOU'RE

THANK YOU ANY. OKAY HI I HAVE A

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:35.090

AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:38.193
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.696
INFORMATION- THE BACKGROUND

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.397
BRIEF IDENTIFIES THAT

01:16:42.464 --> 01:16:44.866
TELEHEALTH IS USES THE HIGHEST

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.268
AMONG BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:47.836
PROVIDERS WHICH ISN'T ANY

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:50.806
SURPRISE TO ME- THE OTHER-

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.140
PROVIDERS LISTED IN YOUR PRE

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:53.942
FOR RADIOLOGISTS PATHOLOGISTS

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:56.511
ER DOCTORS. BUT NOT PRIMARY

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:58.613
CARE SO DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.817
THOUGHTS ON THIS. WELL I THINK

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:04.419
IT IT YOU KNOW IMPART- HE IS AN

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:06.321
ADOPTION STANDPOINT AND A

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.457
MINDSET AS AND SO I PROVIDERS

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:10.292
GET USED TO SORT OF SOME OF

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:12.327
THE- PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:14.629
OF- YOU KNOW COMPONENTS OF THE

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.765
IN PERSON PHYSICAL EXAM. I

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.533
THINK THAT IS CHANGING OVER

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.036
TIME- AND I THINK SOME OF OUR

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:22.637
OTHER EXPERTS MAY WELL BE ABLE

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:25.841
TO GIVE- AN EXPERT ANSWER ON

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.142
THAT EVEN BETTER BUT I THINK

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:29.411
SOME OF THAT IS THE- THE SORT

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.980
OF- TRADITIONS OF A PRIMARY

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:35.417
CARE VISIT- AND I THINK. THOSE

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:38.987
IN LARGER- LARGER SYSTEMS- ARE

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:40.956
ADAPTED- AND MOVED TO

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:42.824
TELEHEALTH MORE MORE AS THE

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:45.193
PAST YEAR- EXISTED I THINK

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.129
OTHER PROVIDERS WERE ABLE TO

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:49.197
TRANSITION MORE QUICKLY- AND

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:50.899
THERE WERE SOME LOWER

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:54.036
THRESHOLDS TO MAKE THAT LEAP.

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:56.104
OKAY GREAT. SO IN TERMS OF THE

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:58.040
COST OF TELUGU HEALTH AM I

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.542
CORRECT THAT- BUT IN YOUR

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.310
BACKGROUND THAT THE COST

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:03.111
EFFECTIVE THIS PORTION OF YOUR

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.113
BACK ON A BRIEF. DID NOT TAKE

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.516
INTO ACCOUNT THE PAYMENT PARITY

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:09.851
REQUIREMENT FOR TELE HEALTH AND

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:11.586
TELE OF. TELEPHONE VISITS AND

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:15.223
MEDICARE. RIGHT SO WHERE WERE

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.392
WE WERE BASING THIS OFF OF THE

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:18.827
BROADLY AVAILABLE LITERATURE I

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:21.063
THINK- YOU KNOW THE PROOF WILL

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.230
BE IN THE PUTTING IN TERMS OF

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:23.298
DOING SOME RETROSPECTIVE

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.167
STUDIES AFTER IN CALIFORNIA IN

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:27.035
THE NEXT YEAR TOO. AND I THINK-

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.603
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:30.338
THAT KEY QUESTIONS SO RIGHT NOW

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:31.973
THE DATA JUST TO SIMPLY DOESN'T

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.142
EXISTS AND SO OKA GREAT

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.644

IN THAT IN MY- ORAL- COMMENTS

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.736
HERE IS TO PROVIDE SOUND POLICY

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:09.204
FRAMEWORK HOW DO WE THINK

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.273
THROUGH WHAT POST PANDEMIC IN

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:12.607
INTENT REGULATIONS FOR

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:14.376
TELEMEDICINE TO LOOK LIKE- NEXT

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:19.648
LIKE. THE FIRST THING IS WHILE-

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:20.715
BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT I

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.350
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:22.851
THERE'S SOME URGENCY IN

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:24.786
FIGURING THIS OUT. I THINK IT'S

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.821
WELL RECOGNIZED THAT

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:27.856
TELEMEDICINE USE HAS

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:29.558
DRAMATICALLY INCREASED DURING

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:30.959
THE PANDEMIC WHAT I THINK IS A

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:33.361
UNDER RECOGNIZED. IS THAT SINCE

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.096
THAT PEAK IT HAS FALLEN QUITE

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:37.299
SIGNIFICANTLY- IN THIS IS A

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.967
WORK WHERE WE'VE BEEN ANALYZING

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.335
WHAT NUMBER THE NUMBER OF

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:42.437
TELEHEALTH VISITS ACROSS FIFTY

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:42.971
THOUSAND PROVIDERS IN THE

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.172
UNITED STATES AS A PERCENTAGE

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.340
THEIR BASELINE VISITS AND WE

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:47.576
SEE AS- ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:48.343
THERE WAS A HUGE SURGE INTIMATE

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:50.111
APRIL. BUT SINCE THAT POINT

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:52.914
WE'VE SEEN IT DECLINED BY MORE

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.849
THAN 50% OUR REASONS FOR THAT.

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:56.685
BUT INCLUDING IN PERTH I

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:58.353
CLINICS REOPENED THROUGHOUT THE

01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.955
NATION WELL ONE OF THE MAJOR

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:01.790
ONES AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:04.125
HERE IS THAT CLINICIANS- ARE

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.228
UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT POST

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.295
PANDEMIC PAYMENT POLICIES GONNA

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.831
LOOK LIKE. AND IF YOU'RE A BUSY

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:11.032
CLINICIAN WHO JUST GONE THROUGH

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.834
A VERY ROUGH TIME FINANCIALLY

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:13.868
WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THAT

01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:15.670
INVESTMENT WHEN YOU KNOW THAT

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:17.973
CALM SUMMER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.441
ONE. YOU NO LONGER WILL BE

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.710
REIMBURSED AND SO THOSE

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:22.310
INVESTMENTS WILL BE FOR NOT.

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:26.948
NEXT SLIDE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:29.150
THAT I VIEW LIKE SO MUCH IN

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.952
POLICY MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:32.687
BALANCING ACT THAT WE FACE IN

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:34.689
EXPANSIONS OF TELEMEDICINE HOW

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.224
DO WE IMPROVE THE ACCESS AND

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:37.259
THE QUALITY OF THE CARE THAT

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:38.860
PATIENTS RECEIVE BUT THERE'S

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:41.162
ALSO THIS RISK OF SPENDING AND

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.497
AS I SAID IN SOME OF THE

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:43.665
WRITTEN MATERIALS AND I

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.033
CIRCULATED TELEMEDICINE'S

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.067
ABILITY TO MAKE THEIR

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:48.370
CONVENIENCE AND MORE ACCESSIBLE

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:49.571
THE KEY TO ITS ENORMOUS

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.106
POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.907
OF MANY PATIENTS MAY ALSO BE

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:56.077
ITS ACHILLES HEEL IN TERMS OF.

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:56.611
INCREASED UTILIZATION AND

01:21:56.678 --> 01:22:00.382
SPENDING. NEXT SLIDE. IN TERMS

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:02.217
OF A FRAMEWORK I THINK THERE'S

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:04.219
A TO BE A HIGH LEVEL POINTS

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:04.986
THAT I WANT TO START WITH THE

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:07.155
FIRST IS I DON'T THINK WE

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.223
SHOULD HAVE A SINGLE

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.692
TELEMEDICINE POLICY IF WE WENT

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.561
TO A YOU KNOW A CLINICIAN A

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:15.930
HEALTH PLAN POLICY MAKERS A

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:17.832
WHAT'S YOUR DRUG POLICY. YOU

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.000
CAN LOOK A LITTLE FUNNY WHAT DO

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:20.435
YOU MEAN THE DRUG POLICY WHICH

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:22.437
DRUG. WHICH PATIENT WHICH

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:24.272
CLINICAL SCENARIO AND I THINK

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:25.874
THAT'S THE SAME LANDS BY WHICH

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:26.708
WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.310
TELEMEDICINE THAT THERE IS NO

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:30.245
SINGLE POLICY ACROSS ALL OF

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:33.281
THOSE- PATIENT POPULATIONS AND

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.283
CLINICAL CONDITIONS. AND THE

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:37.185
SECOND QUESTION IS THAT OKAY

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:39.354
WHICH AGENTS OR CONDITIONS YOU

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:40.622
RECOVER AND REALLY THINK THAT

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:41.556
SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE LENS

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.525
OF VALUE. AND VALUE IN THIS

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:44.993
SENSE MEANS HEALTH OUTCOMES

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.028
ACHIEVED HER DOLLARS SPEND ARE

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:48.997
WE GETTING. A BETTER BANG FOR

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:51.299
OUR BUCK IN TERMS OF IMPROVING

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:52.634
THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS.

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:53.635
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT DOES

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:56.304
VALUE MEAN IN THIS CONTEXT OF

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:56.905
TELEMEDICINE IF YOU GO TO THE

01:22:56.971 --> 01:23:01.643
NEXT SLIDE. WHAT ARE HIGH VALUE

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.845
APPLICATIONS OF TELEMEDICINE.

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:04.746
AND WITH POORLY CONTROLLED

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.715
DEPRESSION WHO DOESN'T HAVE

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.483
ACCESS TO THE PROVIDER NOW GETS

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.552
CARE VIA TELEMEDICINE FOR SAY A

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:13.021
PSYCHIATRIST AND IN THE TACTIC

PERSON WITH POORLY CONTROLLED

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:17.992
DEPRESSION DIABETES WHO NW

AND THEIR DIABETES CARE IS

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:26.101
IMPROVED. HOW ABOUT LOW VALUE

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.536

THAT WERE TODAY OR YOU KNOW

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:43.685
IT'S REALLY I THINK

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:44.953
EVERYTHING'S OKAY BUT WHY DON'T

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.788

DOCTOR TO MAKE SURE THAT I.

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:54.362
IT'S REALLY JUST A COLD. NONE

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:56.197
OF THESE ARE MALICIOUS. ON

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.665
EITHER THE PROVIDER OR THE

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.901
PATIENT'S SIDE. BUT THE REASON

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.269
I HIGHLIGHT THOSE OF THOSE RING

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.837
SAMPLES. OF WHERE WE'RE

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:04.839
INCREASING UTILIZATION OF CARE.

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:06.374
OR SPENDING. AND WE'RE NOT

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:07.976
HAVING ANY SUBSTANTIVE BENEFITS

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:10.178
IN TERMS OF HEALTH. AND SO

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.846
REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.314
TELEMEDICINE PAYMENT POLICY AND

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:14.449
REGULATIONS IS HOW DO WE

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:17.719
ENCOURAGE THIS HIGHER VALUES.

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:23.591
pNEXT LIKE. SO AGAIN GOING BACK

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:24.826
TO THE IDEA OF WHEN YOU WHEN WE

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.261
THINK ABOUT VALUE WE NEED TO BE

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.062
THINKING ABOUT WHICH HE SENSE

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:29.631
WHICH CONDITIONS YES IS A

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:31.266
PATIENT WHO LIVES IN A HIGH

01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:32.667
INCOME I DON'T KNOW BEVERLY

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.536
HILLS AND HAS ACCESS TO

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:36.604
PROVIDERS THE ADDITIONAL VISITS

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.006
THEY HERE SHE MIGHT RECEIVE MAY

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:39.774
NOT ADD SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:40.909
WHILE A PATIENT IN A RURAL

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:44.078
COMMUNITY- OR- LOWER INCOME

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:45.780
PATIENTS THOSE ADDITIONAL

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.115
VISITS MIGHT BE HIGHER VALUE

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:48.716
BECAUSE OF THE- RESOURCES THEY

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.718
ALREADY HAVE. WHICH CONDITION

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.520
IS THIS A CONDITION THAT IS

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.823
UNDER- WHERE WE ARE WORRIED

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.558
ABOUT UNDER USE IN PARTICULAR

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.159
CHRONIC ILLNESSES OR WE TALKING

01:24:58.226 --> 01:24:59.694
ABOUT CONDITIONS SUCH AS COLDS

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:03.431
RASHES AND OTHERS WHERE THERE

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:04.199
IS A CONCERN ABOUT OVER USE. IS

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:05.400
THE CARE ADDED THERE VERSUS

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.001
SUBSTITUTION I HEAR A LOT OF

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:09.170
CONVERSATION ABOUT TELEMEDICINE

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:12.574
CAN REDUCE SPENDING BY. AT

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.274
PREVENTING AN EMERGENCY

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:14.943
DEPARTMENT VISIT. OR IS THE

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:16.478
CARE ADDITIVE AND THESE ARE

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.780
GONNA REALLY DO. IMPACT WHAT

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:20.748
THE VALUE WORSE COST

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:21.282
IMPLICATIONS ARE OF

01:25:21.349 --> 01:25:23.451
TELEMEDICINE. AND THEN LASTLY

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:26.154
ON SOMETHING I'LL COME BACK TO

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:26.988
A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS PAIRED.

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:28.923
IF YOU PAY IF A TELEMEDICINE

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:31.359
VISIT. IS PAID FOR LESS THAN AN

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:32.961
IN PERSON VISIT AND IT WOULD

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:34.929
IMPROVE THE HEALTH SHOULD THE

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.731
SAME AMOUNT AND THAT IS GOING

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:37.665
TO BE A HIGHER VALUE

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:40.468
APPLICATION WELL- AND IF YOU

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:41.803
PAY THE SAME AMOUNT THE VALUE

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.204
MIGHT BE DECREASED AND THAT'S

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:45.306
SOMETHING. THAT REALLY PLAY

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:47.308
THIS IMPORTANT ROLE WE THINK

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:51.613
ABOUT VALUE. NEXT LIKE. SO

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:53.381
THOSE I HOPE THAT FRAMEWORK

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:54.649
PROVIDES SOME CONTEXT AND

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.450
THINKING ABOUT ALL THE

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:57.519
STRATEGIES THAT WE SEE ACROSS

01:25:57.585 --> 01:25:59.153
BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.022
MEDICARE POLICY IN DIFFERENT

01:26:01.089 --> 01:26:02.957
STATES AS WELL AS PRIVATE

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.792
INSURERS IN WHICH HOW THEY HAVE

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:06.427
APPLIED TELEMEDICINE POLICY

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.396
REALLY IT'S ABOUT MAYBE NOT

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:09.998
ALWAYS SAID EXPLICITLY BUT IT'S

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:11.299
ABOUT HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE HIGH

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:13.501
VALUE AT CARE IN DISCOURAGING

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:14.936
LOW VALUE CARE ALTERNATIVE

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.437
PAYMENT MODELS WERE ALREADY

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.439
ADDRESSED- THOSE ARE IMPORTANT

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:20.508
IDEA WHICH IS THAT IF WE PAY

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:23.111
PROVIDERS. AND A RISK CONTRACT

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:25.246
AND THEY HAVE TO FACE THE RISK

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:27.749
OF OVER USE THEY'RE GOING TO

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:29.350
EMPHASIZE HIGH VALUE CARE AS

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:30.285
YOU SEE IN SOME OF THE

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:31.920
ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:34.155
CONTRACTS THAT MEDICARE HAS

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:37.859
THEY HAVE GREATER ITS

01:26:37.926 --> 01:26:38.359
AVAILABILITY AND USE OF

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:38.893
TELEMEDICINE. IN TERMS OF

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.195
BENEFIT DESIGN IN EITHER WE SEE

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.196
A LOT NUMBER OF PRIVATE

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:43.998
INSURERS WHO HAVE REINSTATED

01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:46.267
OUT OF POCKET COSTS IN THE LAST

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.335
MONTH OR TWO FOR TELEMEDICINE

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.437
VISITS. OR MEDICARE PREVIOUSLY

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:51.239
WHICH REQUIRED A PERSON TO GO

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:53.474
TO A LOCAL CLINIC. TO HAVE

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:54.909
THEIR TELEMEDICINE VISIT BY

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.945
INCREASING THOSE TIME COSTS ARE

01:26:57.011 --> 01:26:58.780
OUT OF POCKET COSTS THE THOUGHT

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.214
IS THAT YOU'RE ENCOURAGING HIGH

01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:02.450
VALUE IN DISCOURAGING LOW VALUE

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:06.220
CARE. WE SEE MANY- PAYERS LIMIT

01:27:06.287 --> 01:27:07.789
COVERAGE TO TURN PATIENTS FOR

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:09.657
EXAMPLE RURAL PATIENTS AND

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:11.092
PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE PRIMARY

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.027
CARE OR CONDITIONS WHERE THE ON

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.629
THE MEDICARE SIDE THERE'S

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:17.332
EXPANSIONS OF CARE ONLY. FOR

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:19.701
STROKE CARE A SUBSTANCE USE

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:20.802
DISORDERS AND NOW MOST RECENTLY

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.737
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH THE IDEA

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.272
THAT THESE ARE PLACES WHERE

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:26.507
THERE'S UNDER USE OF CARE AND

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:27.742
WE'RE GOING TO THE AIRPORT

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:30.311
CHIEF HIGHER VALUE APPLICATIONS

01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:31.512
OF TELEMEDICINE. I'VE ALREADY

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:33.014
MENTIONED THE PAYMENT RATE FOR

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.616
TELEMEDICINE AND THE IDEA IS

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:37.085
THAT WHEN WE- PAID LESS FOR

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:38.786
TELEMEDICINE WE MIGHT DETER

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.521
SOME OF THAT LOWER VALUE CARE.

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:41.823
AND LASTLY THERE HAVE BEEN A

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:43.558
LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT MANY OF

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:44.759
THE PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.127
EMERGED THAT PROVIDE ONLY

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:48.229
TELEMEDICINE. AND SOME CONCERNS

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:49.964
THAT THEY MIGHT BE PROVIDING

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.933
LOWER VALUE CARE THAT'S NOT

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.401
REALLY IMPROVING THE HEALTH SO

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:54.902
YOU'LL SEE SOME REGULATIONS

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.771
WILL REQUIRE AN IN PERSON VISIT

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:58.339
BEFORE A TELEMEDICINE VISIT

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:59.507
JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:01.609
THAT'S WHAT THE CONGRESS. HAS

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:03.945
IMPLEMENTED FOR MEDICARE FOR

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:04.545
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH VISITS. NEXT

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:09.550
TIME. I'D BE REMISS WITHOUT

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:11.252
ADDRESSING A REALLY CRITICAL

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:13.187
ISSUE WHICH IS THE ISSUES OF

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:14.622
DISPARITIES OF CARE AND HOW

01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:16.324
THAT APPLIES TELEMEDICINE IN A

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:17.692
PIECE THAT WE PUBLISHED LAST

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.661
YEAR- IN THE SUMMER WE LOOKED

01:28:19.727 --> 01:28:21.229
ACROSS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:22.997
IT AT IN THE U. S. THAT'S HOW

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:25.133
WHAT FRACTION OF THOSE MEDICARE

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:27.702
BENEFICIARIES HAD ACCESS TO A

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:30.171
COMPUTER. OR SMARTPHONE THAT

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:32.640
WOULD FACILITATE THE USE OF A

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:35.176
VIDEO MESSAGE. WE FOUND NOT

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.478
SURPRISINGLY THAT THOSE- WITH

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:38.913
LESS THAN A 100% OF THE FEDERAL

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.782
POVERTY LINE AROUND HALF OF

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:43.484
THEM DID NOT HAVE. A LACK AT

01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:45.753
THAT DIGITAL ACCESS. AND AS

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:46.854
INCOME WILL INCREASE THE

01:28:46.921 --> 01:28:49.290
DIGITAL AVAILABILITY ADDITIONAL

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:51.492
ACCESS INCREASED. WE THOUGHT

01:28:51.559 --> 01:28:53.061
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BY RACE

01:28:53.127 --> 01:28:54.762
AND ETHNICITY AND WE ALSO SAW

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:56.264
THAT RURAL PATIENTS NOT

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.566
SURPRISED BENEFICIARIES NOT

01:28:58.633 --> 01:28:59.167
SURPRISINGLY HAD LESS DIGITAL

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:01.402
ACCESS. AND SO THIS IS MADE

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:02.904
SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS THAT WERE

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:05.907
ALREADY IT NEEDED TO- TODAY

01:29:05.973 --> 01:29:08.409
WHICH IS THAT- THAT THE

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:10.311
EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH BECAUSE

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:11.713
SO MANY OF OUR DISADVANTAGED

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:13.081
POPULATIONS WILL NOT HAVE

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:16.217
THESE- TO BE ABLE TO DO A VIDEO

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:18.886
VISIT. THEREFORE THIS WILL

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:20.121
INCREASE DISPARITIES OF CARE

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.889
AND THEN AS DRIVENAS MANY OF

01:29:21.956 --> 01:29:23.357
YOU ARE AWARE THE EXPANSION OF

01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:27.562
TELEPHONE VISITS- AS ANOTHER

01:29:27.628 --> 01:29:28.129
WAY OF PROVIDING CARE DURING

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:31.132
AND THEN. NOW THE FUTURE OF ONE

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.400
VISITS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:34.469
BECAUSE AGAIN. THERE'S CERTAIN

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.771
PATIENT POPULATIONS THAT WON'T

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:38.272
HAVE ACCESS TO IT. BUT THEN

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:39.540
THERE'S ALSO WHILE TELEPHONE

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:41.109
VISITS ARE RIGHT LIKE THE JUST

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.477
FINE FOR MANY CLINICAL

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:44.112
ENCOUNTERS THERE HAS BEEN A

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:45.913
CONCERN THAT IN SOME CLINICAL

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.182
ENCOUNTERS A TELEPHONE VISIT IS

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:49.584
NOT SUFFICIENT AND WE NEED THE

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:52.053
VIDEO COMPONENT AND IS THERE A

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.788
CONCERN THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:55.623
PATIENTS WITH GAPS- WILL

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:58.993
INABILITY TO HAVE A VIDEO OF

01:29:59.060 --> 01:29:59.494
INCIDENTS OF SUBSTANTIAL

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.197
CONCERN. NOW NEXT LINE. HOW

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:04.565
THIS ALL PLAYS OUT IS GOING TO

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:05.466
BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:07.135
VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO TRY

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:08.302
JUST LAST WEEK WE PUBLISHED A

01:30:08.369 --> 01:30:09.837
PIECE IN A JOURNAL WHERE WE

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.906
LOOKED ACROSS WHAT PERCENTAGE

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:13.007
OF ALL THIS IT'S WE'RE

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.442
DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:16.611
THE UNITED STATES RECEIVING

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.613
WERE VIA TELEMEDICINE. WE FOUND

01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:22.416
CONSISTENT WITH THE CONCERNS-ABOUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THAT

01:30:22.483 --> 01:30:23.885
URBAN PATIENTS WERE MUCH MORE

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:27.054
LIKELY TO HAVE A- HIGHER

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.756
FRACTION OF THEIR VISITS

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.558
PROVIDE TELEMEDICINE. HOWEVER

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:34.762
INTERESTINGLY WHEN WE LOOK AT-

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:38.132
HE PATIENTS BROKEN DOWN BY. THE

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:39.801
THEIR COUNTY AND WHAT FRACTION

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:41.836
OF THE COUNTY WAS WHITE WE

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.471
FOUND THAT AS THE POPULATION

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:45.339
BECAME MORE WHITE THE USE OF

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:47.608
TELEMEDICINE REDUCE. AND SO TO

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:48.676
BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:50.678
TRACK. HOW THIS PLAYS OUT

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:53.014
DURING THE PANDEMIC- AS WE MOVE

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.385
FORWARD. NEXT SLIDE. SHOULD THE

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:58.820
WRAP UP I WANTED TO PROVIDE MY

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:00.488
OWN RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.790
THINKING ABOUT A POLICY AND

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:06.194
REGULATIONS I THINK THAT- AS

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.029
MANY OF US ARE MOVING FOR MANY

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:09.263
ACROSS DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:10.464
BUT WHENEVER WE HAVE

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:11.933
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS FOR

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:15.002
CLINICIANS- THAT'S GOING TO

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:17.138
ENCOURAGE HIGHER VALUE USES A

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:19.874
TELEMEDICINE. I DO NOT BELIEVE

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:20.975
THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:23.044
PRODUCTS BANSHA TELEMEDICINE

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.846
ACROSS ALL CONDITIONS BUT I

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:26.314
WOULD ADVOCATE FOR MORE LIMITED

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.782
EXPANSION TO CERTAIN HIGH VALUE

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.817
CONDITIONS SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:31.319
HEALTH SUCH AS SUBSTANCE USE

01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:33.120
DISORDERS. AND CHRONIC

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:35.156
ILLNESSES AND ALSO HIGHER RISK

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:36.457
COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:37.291
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:39.427
RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:40.761
THOSE WHO GET CARE FROM SAFETY

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:42.964
NET PROVIDERS. I THINK THE

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:44.165
SAFETY NET PROVIDERS ARE THE

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:46.267
KEY AND THOSE FOR REGULATIONS

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.702
THAT WERE ALREADY ELIMINATED I

01:31:47.768 --> 01:31:48.970
WOULD MAKE THOSE PERMANENT IN

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:51.405
TERMS OF FOR FEDERALLY

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:51.973
QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:53.407
RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. I AM

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:54.709
AGAINST THE PAINT THAT PAYMENT

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:57.044
PARITY. AND WE CAN DISCUSS THIS

01:31:57.111 --> 01:31:58.980
MORE IN DETAIL LATER BUT I FEEL

01:31:59.046 --> 01:31:59.814
THAT WE SHOULD PAY FOR

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:01.716
TELEMEDICINE VISITS BOTH VIDEO

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:03.618
AND AUDIO AT LOWER RATES THAN

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:05.586
IN PERSON VISITS. I AM VERY

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.655
CONCERNED ABOUT CREATING A TWO

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:08.489
TIERED SYSTEM IN THE UNITED

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.725
STATES- AT EIGHTY AND IN

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:13.261
CALIFORNIA. WHERE FOR PATIENTS

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:15.696
GET TELEPHONE CALLS. AND RICH

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:18.299
PEOPLE GET VIDEO CALLS. THOUGH

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.001
I'M VERY COGNISANT THAT ARE

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:22.036
DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS WON'T

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:23.838
HAVE ACCESS TO VIDEO BUSINESS

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:25.840
RIGHT NOW AND SO WHAT I'M

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:27.275
ADVOCATING FOR IS A LIMITED

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:29.110
EXPANSION FOR TELEPHONE CALLS

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:30.978
IS SUPERIOR TO FACILITATE BOTH

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.680
ON THE POLICY SIDE CLINICIAN

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:35.149
SIDE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO VIDEO

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.218
ISITS ALL PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:39.120
TO THAT. AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:40.688
THE ONE NICE THING HERE IS THE

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:42.356
WIND IS AT OUR BACKS THAT THE

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.525
ABILITY FOR MORE MORE PATIENTS

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:45.860
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE VIDEO

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:49.430
VISITS IS INCREASING AS ARE YOU

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:49.997
KNOW SMARTPHONES BECOME MORE

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:54.001
UBIQUITOUS. SO HEY NEXT SLIDE-

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.102
SOME OF THE POINTS THAT I'VE

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:57.138
MADE HERE I'M SORRY NO NEXT

01:32:57.204 --> 01:33:00.942
LIVE. ARE IN MY WRITTEN

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:01.542
COMMENTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:03.077
YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY

MUCH REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:06.247
THAT- QUESTIONS FROM MY

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:10.384
COLLEAGUES. I GUESS ON THE

01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:11.886
CHATTY ONE TODAY SO I ALWAYS

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:13.754
HAVE CLASS DOESN'T MATTER

01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:14.956
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE TOPIC

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:17.158
SO- YOU WERE PART OF A WORK

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:18.526
GROUP THAT LOOKED AT WHAT

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:19.994
TELEHEALTH POLICY SHOULD BE IN

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:22.964
VERMONT. SO WHERE DID THEY LAND

01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:24.198
ON COVERAGE OF TELEPHONE

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.800
TELEPHONE VISITS AND PAIN AT

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:28.235
PARITY. AND SAY MEDICAID AND

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:32.306
PRIVATE COVERAGE. YES I WAS I

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:36.177
TESTIFIED JUST AS I DID HERE-

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.345
TALKING I WENT AND SO I

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:38.980
ACTUALLY DO NOT REMEMBER IN

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:40.414
OTHERS- MAKE FONG AND OTHERS

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:43.684
MIGHT REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW-

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:45.519
WHERE THEY CAME DOWN TO ON THAT

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:47.388
MY MEMORY AND I COULD BE WRONG

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:48.823
ON THIS WAS THAT IT WAS NOT

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:51.959
COVERED AT WITH PARITY FOR

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:52.593
TELEPHONE VISITS BUT I COULD BE

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:55.663
WRONG. OKAY I'LL BE HONEST I'M

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:56.864
A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT PAYING

01:33:56.931 --> 01:33:58.199
A PARITY WILL GIVE PROVIDERS AN

01:33:58.265 --> 01:34:00.201
INCENTIVE TO NOT HAVE PATIENTS

01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:01.502
COME INTO THE OFFICE OR TO SET

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:03.137
ASIDE. PART OF THE CURRENT

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:04.705
OFFICE HOURS FOR TELEPHONE AND

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:08.709
TELEHEALTH BILLS. RECALLS SO. I

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:10.444
RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:11.912
TELEPHONE CALLS AND VIDEO

01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:12.546
VISITS WILL WORK FOR A LOT OF

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:14.715
PATIENCE. MORE IT WON'T WORK

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:17.251
FOR INFANTS. OR SOME ELDERLY

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.020
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEARING LOSS

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:22.823
OR- PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA- AM I

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:24.692
WRONG TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:26.894
THAT- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS NO

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:28.162
I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY MANY

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:31.632
PLACES AND I BELIEVE- MISTER

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:33.034
CORBETT HAS CITED SOME OF OUR

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:36.871
WORK WHERE WE LOOKED AT- THE

01:34:36.937 --> 01:34:38.506
USE OF VIDEO CALLS FOR

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:40.908
TREATMENT OF INFANTS FOR-

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.343
APPEARED FACTIONS AND WE FOUND

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:43.177
THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:45.513
PROVIDED BY- VIDEO BUSINESS WAS

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.515
INFERIOR. WITH A GREATER USE OF

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:49.016
BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS FOR

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.818
CHILDREN ARE INFANTSIN THAT

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.520
CIRCUMSTANCE. THAT'S JUST A

01:34:52.586 --> 01:34:56.624
SAMPLE OF- WHERE TELEMEDICINE

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:58.059
CAN PROVIDE INFERIOR CARE I DO

01:34:58.125 --> 01:35:00.661
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT'S JUST

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:01.662
ONE CLINICAL AREA THERE MANY

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:02.863
CLINICAL AREAS WHERE AS

01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:04.532
DOCUMENTS RECORDED HIGHLIGHTED

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:06.801
WHERE A TELEMEDICINE PROVIDES

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:08.636
EQUAL QUALITY OF CARE BUT SO

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:12.840
BUT A LONG WINDED WAY OF SAYING

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:13.441
I THINK YOUR CONCERN. IS WELL

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:14.008
FOUNDED. WELL AND I THINK I

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:15.643
THINK IN GENERAL SO- I

01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:17.178
REPRESENT A VERY RURAL DISTRICT

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:19.413
AND ACCESS TO SOME SPECIALTY

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:22.083
CARE IS PRETTY LIMITED SO. SO

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.018
THAT HIGH VALUE CARE THAT MIGHT

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:25.786
BE TO BE ABLE TO BE DELIVERED

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:28.022
THAT MIGHT SAVE A PATIENT- FOR

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:29.957
FIVE HOURS ONE WAY TRIP. COULD

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:33.494
BE A HUGE BENEFIT TO EVERYONE-

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.696
AND SO I REALLY CLEARLY SEE THE

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.698
VALUE HERE BUT I BUT I DO HAVE

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:38.766
THESE SORT OF LINGERING

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:40.101
QUESTIONS IN THE BACK IN THE

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:41.702
BACK OF MY MIND ABOUT SOME

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:45.072
OTHER OTHER THINGS- INTO TO THE

01:35:45.139 --> 01:35:47.141
CONCERNS. EXPRESSED ABOUT HOW

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.809
TELEHEALTH IS A CONCERN ABOUT

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:50.144
OVER UTILIZATION YOU TALKED

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:52.947
ABOUT THAT IN YOUR IN YOUR LOW

01:35:53.013 --> 01:35:54.815
VALUE THE BILL VALUE VISITS-

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:56.383
POTENTIALLY FRAUD AND I DON'T

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:57.952
LIKE TO BRING A PRODUCT LIKE TO

01:35:58.018 --> 01:35:59.186
THINK THAT THAT'S NOT. A

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:01.422
POSSIBILITY BUT- IT'S SOMETHING

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:03.224
I THINK WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER.

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:05.126
SO FOR EXAMPLE WILL TELEPHONE

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:06.594
CALLS THAT OCCUR AS PART OF

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:09.263
ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE NOW

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.932
BECOME BILLABLE VISITS- DO WE

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:15.169
HAVE EVIDENCE TO DATE ON EITHER

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:16.837
OF THOSE TWO TOPICS- OKAY YES I

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:17.771
THINK THERE'S A REALLY

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:20.674
IMPORTANT. POINTS THERE- I

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:21.675
THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:23.477
COGNIZANT ALSO ON THE PHONE

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:26.213
CALL SIDE. OF A POTENTIAL

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.682
PATIENT BACKLASH AGAIN THIS IS

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:30.985
ANECDOTAL AND I DO RECOGNIZE

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:33.020
THAT. BUT PREVIOUSLY YOU WOULD

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:34.822
CALL MYSELF OR ANOTHER

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:36.524
PHYSICIAN AND SAY YOU KNOW CAN

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:37.725
YOU GIVE ME SOME ADVICE AND I

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:39.360
WOULD GIVE PEOPLE ADVICE. ON

01:36:39.426 --> 01:36:40.461
THE TELEPHONE AND I WAS JUST

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:41.495
TIRED OF PART OF WHAT YOU

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:44.198
PROVIDE AS A CLINICIAN. AND NOW

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:46.634
A PATIENT DOES THE SAME AND A

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.169
FIVE MINUTE PHONE CALL CENTERS

01:36:48.235 --> 01:36:51.405
INTO A VISIT AN AUDIO ONLY.

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.307
TELEMEDICINE VISIT. AND THE

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:54.608
PERSON RECEIVES A BILL IN THE

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:55.943
MAIL FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:57.711
DOLLARS AND IF THEY HAVE A HIGH

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:58.345
DEDUCTIBLE PLAN THAT'S OUT OF

01:36:58.412 --> 01:36:59.813
THEIR OWN POCKET. IS YOU DO

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.015
HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:02.416
PATIENTS MAY NOT SEE THE VALUE

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:03.317
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:04.785
BE THE GUIDING FORCE BUT I DO

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:06.453
WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.023
IS THIS ASPECT OF- TELEPHONE

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:10.624
CARE THAT WE NEED TO BE. AT

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:12.693
LEAST COGNIZANT OF. REGARDING

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.094
THE FRAUD ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED

01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:16.063
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONCERN.

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:17.665
AND IT VARIES I THINK BY.

01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:19.600
POLICYMAKER HOW MUCH OF THAT IS

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:21.101
AN ISSUE. THE OFFICE OF THE

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:23.103
INSPECTOR GENERAL AND MEDICARE-

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:24.171
PUT PUT OUT A PIECE I THINK

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:25.973
IT'S JUST THE LAST COUPLE DAYS

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.909
CALLING THAT. FRAUD IS A MAJOR

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:30.578
ISSUE THEY CALLED OPEN SEASON.

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:34.114
I'VE HEARD FOLKS IN- ON THE

01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:35.583
MEDICARE SIDE IN PARTICULAR AND

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:37.251
MET TAX CONCERNED THAT

01:37:37.318 --> 01:37:39.353
TELEMEDICINE WILL FACILITATE

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:41.355
FRAUD AND YOU KNOW IT'S- FRAUD

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.424
ON STEROIDS. OKAY THAT'S VERY

01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:44.425
THESE ARE SOME BOMBASTIC

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:45.759
LANGUAGE THAT FOLKS ARE USING

01:37:45.826 --> 01:37:47.561
BUT I DO THINK IT EXPERT THAT

01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:49.363
REFLECTS A- I THINK

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:51.332
INAPPROPRIATE CONCERN. THAT

01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:52.833
TELEMEDICINE COULD FACILITATE

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:58.505
FRAUD AND IS SOMETHING. THAT

01:37:58.572 --> 01:37:59.073
REALLY NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY

01:37:59.139 --> 01:37:59.673
MONITORED. WITH YOU THANK YOU

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:01.308
FOR MUCH- AND- AT THAT THAT'S

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:03.677
PRETTY QUESTION BY- ASSEMBLY

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:05.045
MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY SO I HAVE A

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:07.014
COUPLE QUESTIONS- WE RING UP

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:10.517
FRAUD. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A OF. THE

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:11.385
RINGS A LOT OF BILLS FOR ALL OF

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:14.488
US. I'M IS A PROFESSIONAL THE

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:15.990
MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL YOU HAVE

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:18.525
ETHICS AND- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:19.493
WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AND

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.695
GETTING YOUR- DEGREE I THINK

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:24.498
pNEED TO FOLLOW BY ONE OF IS

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:25.065
MAKING SURE YOU DON'T HAVE

01:38:25.132 --> 01:38:27.001
FRAUD SO. I JUST WAS

01:38:27.067 --> 01:38:29.069
QUESTIONING THAT. BUT I'M IN

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:30.170
YOUR STUDIES HAVE YOU DONE

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:34.141
ANYTHING REGARDING- SKILLED-

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:36.443
NURSING FACILITIES OR- HOME

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:39.446
HEALTH CARE OR- I SEE WHERE

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:40.648
THIS COULD WORK WELL IN FROM

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.182
OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:45.152
GETTING PEOPLE. TO SEE A DOCTOR

01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:46.620
THROUGH A VIDEO CONFERENCE AND

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:49.690
HAVE YOU HAD ANY- INFORMATION

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.392
ALONG THAT LINE I'M TRYING TO

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:53.093
BE REALLY BROUGHT ON HOW WE CAN

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.229
GET SOME. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:59.600
TO- ARE SENIOR CITIZENS. YEAH

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.869
AT. IDEA A GREAT AREA IN THE

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:03.103
AREA OF SKILLED NURSING

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.238
FACILITIES JUST FOR THOSE

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:06.373
UNFAMILIAR IT IS A REALLY

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.175
CRITICAL ISSUE OF ACCESS TO

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:09.543
CARE THERE ARE CLINICIANS WHO

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:11.312
COMBINE WEEKLY OR COUPLE EVERY

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:12.913
COUPLE TIMES A WEEK. BUT IN

01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:14.682
TERMS OF IN PARTICULAR SOME OF

01:39:14.748 --> 01:39:17.685
OUR MOST. OUR SICKEST MEMBERS

01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:20.454
OF OUR SOCIETY WHO. RESIDED IN

01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:22.823
LONG TERM- SKILLED NURSING

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.725
FACILITIES NURSING HOMES THEY

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:27.061
OFTEN LACK THE ACCESS TO

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:29.163
SPECIALTY CARE THEY NEED. AND

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:30.564
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FROM A

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:32.566
LOGISTICS FINANCING AND

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:35.069
FINANCIAL. SYSTEM TO GET THEM

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:36.103
FROM THE SKILLED NURSING

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:39.540
FACILITY TO- A SPECIALTY A

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:40.974
GERIATRICIAN FOR EXAMPLE OR A

01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:42.509
PSYCHIATRIST IN DEPRESSION IS

01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:45.079
AN ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.747
TELEMEDICINE THAT IS A PATIENT

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:48.515
POPULATION WHERE I. AM

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:50.784
CONCERNED- GREATLY ABOUT UNDER

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:53.120
USE A SPECIALTY CARE AND WOULD

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:55.089
BE A POPULATION THAT I WOULD BE

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:56.623
AT LEAST ADVOCATING FOR

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:59.693
BROADER. GREATER EXPANSION OF

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.527
TELEMEDICINE FOR THAT

01:40:00.594 --> 01:40:04.598
POPULATION. IN TERMS OF

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:05.132
SPECIFIC STUDIES. THERE A

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:06.233
COUPLE THAT I MIGHT HIGHLIGHT

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.634
THE FIRST IS THERE HAVE BEEN

01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:08.635
SOME STUDIES INCLUDING A

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:11.004
RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL IN

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:12.439
NURSING HOMES OR SKILLED

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:14.041
NURSING FACILITIES WHERE THEY

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:15.409
HAVE PROVIDED AFTER HOURS

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:17.378
TELEMEDICINE COVERAGE. AND

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:18.512
THERE IS A REALLY HIGH VALUE

01:40:18.579 --> 01:40:20.147
APPLICATIONS BECAUSE MANY

01:40:20.214 --> 01:40:21.782
PATIENTS IT'S ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.451
NIGHT ON A FRIDAY THE NURSES AT

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:25.819
THE NURSING HOME CAN'T GET A

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:27.554
CLINICIAN ON THE PHONE AND

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:28.455
THEY'LL SAY OKAY I'LL JUST

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:30.524
TRANSFER THE PATIENT TO. THE

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:32.860
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THAT'S

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:33.727
OBVIOUSLY VERY DISRUPTIVE FOR

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:36.096
THE PATIENT. AS WELL AS ALSO

01:40:36.163 --> 01:40:36.964
QUITE COSTLY TO OUR HEALTHCARE

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:39.133
SYSTEM. AND THAT AFTER HOURS

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:41.101
COVERAGE OF TELEMEDICINE WAS

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:43.404
EFFECTIVE IN BOTH- IMPROVING

01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:45.339
THE HEALTH AS WELL AS REDUCING

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:46.840
UTILIZATION IS A REALLY GREAT

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.442
EXAMPLE OF HOW TELEMEDICINE CAN

01:40:48.509 --> 01:40:50.577
BE USED THEIR- AND THE LAST

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:51.512
POINT I'LL MAKE IS SOME

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:53.180
UNPUBLISHED WORK WE'VE LOOKED

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:55.182
AT THE USE OF TELEMEDICINE. IN

01:40:55.249 --> 01:40:57.217
NURSING HOMES AND CONSISTENT

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:58.185
WITH WHAT WE SHOWED YOU

01:40:58.252 --> 01:40:59.920
PREVIOUSLY MISSED IN OUT

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:00.921
PATIENT PRACTICES THERE'S BEEN

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:03.123
pA VERY DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:05.192
USE OF. TELEMEDICINE IN NURSING

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:08.028
HOMES- AT LEAST WHAT WE SEE IN

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:09.897
THE MEDICARE POPULATION. SO WE

01:41:09.963 --> 01:41:11.498
HAVE SEEN AND HAD DISCUSSIONS

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:13.400
HERE IN CALIFORNIA REGARDING OF

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:14.768
SKILLED NURSING OR NURSING

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:17.771
HOMES OREGON HEALTH HOME CARE.

01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:19.106
AND THE INTEREST IS DEFINITELY

01:41:19.173 --> 01:41:20.140
THERE OF COURSE IS ALWAYS THE

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:21.575
COSTS OF THAT RIGHT IS GETTING

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:25.179
THEM THE- ACCESS TO A LAPTOP OR

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:28.215
WHATEVER THE CASE MIGHT BE. OR

01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:29.850
AND LACKOF INTERNET

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.318
CONNECTIVITY SO THAT'S

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:32.319
SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE COULD

01:41:32.386 --> 01:41:33.654
REALLY UTILIZE AND YOU KNOW I

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:35.122
THINK ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.989
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN REST

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:38.225
HOMES OR- ARE NURSING HOMES IN

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:39.493
HIRING SOMEBODY DIDN'T COMBINED

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:40.694
SEEM ON A REGULAR TIME

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:41.662
EVERYBODY GOT A LITTLE

01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:43.497
FRIGHTENED TO GO SEE SOME SO. I

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.699
THINK DURING THIS TIME IF ANY

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:46.266
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:48.001
TIME THE TELEMEDICINE WAS-

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:49.803

PANDEMIC LANDSCAPE SHOULD LOOK

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:34.534
LIKE I'LL BE DISCUSSING WHAT

RAPIDLY ACCEPTED MODELS OF

01:44:52.252 --> 01:44:54.187
TELEMEDICINE GIVE RISE TO A

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:55.856
VARIETY OF ACCESS BARRIERS FOR

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:57.591
OUR DISADVANTAGED PATIENTS AND

01:44:57.658 --> 01:44:59.226

AUDIO ONLY ABBAS AT CEMEX SLIDE.

01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:27.421
SO TELL HEALTH- THAT IS STILL

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:28.922
HEALTHCARE THAT IS EQUITABLE IS

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:31.358
ACCESSIBLE. BOTH IN PERSON AND

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:33.326
VIRTUALLY FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:34.695
REGARDLESS OF LINGUISTIC

LITERACY OR SOCIOECONOMIC

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:39.399
STATUS IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:41.201
THE UNDERLYING LANDSCAPE WITHIN

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:42.135
WHICH OUR PATIENTS ARE

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:43.970
SITUATED. AND THE STRUCTURAL

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:45.072
BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE AS A

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:47.374
RESULT- SO FAR AND

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:49.276
UNSURPRISINGLY EXISTING

01:45:49.342 --> 01:45:51.278
LITERATURE IS DEMONSTRATING THE

01:45:51.344 --> 01:45:53.847
USUAL PATTERNS OF ACCESS

01:45:53.914 --> 01:45:56.550
AFFLUENT YOUNG AND NON HISPANIC

01:45:56.616 --> 01:45:57.684
WHITE POPULATIONS AND

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:59.386
TELEHEALTH IN RELIEVING BEHIND.

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:00.520
WILL NOBLE AND ALREADY

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:02.255
UNDERSERVED PATIENTS IN THIS IS

01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:03.724
A SYSTEM LEVEL FINANCED.

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:04.925
DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:06.860
ACCESS OR QUALITY OF CARE FOR

01:46:06.927 --> 01:46:07.594
MINORITIES HAVE BEEN

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:09.162
EXTENSIVELY DOCUMENTED IN THE

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:11.098
LITERATURE- PRIOR TO THE

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:12.432
SKYROCKETING AND INCORPORATION

01:46:12.499 --> 01:46:14.000
OF TELEHEALTH. YOU KNOW ON

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:15.669
AVERAGE OF LATINOS AND AFRICAN

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:17.738
AMERICANS HAVE WORSE ACCESS TO

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:19.606
EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE THAN DO

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:20.741
NON HISPANIC WHITES BUT

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:21.875
WORSENING THESE EXISTING

01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:23.777
DISPARITIES IF WE SET UP OR

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:25.312
CONTINUE TELEHEALTH ECOSYSTEM

01:46:25.378 --> 01:46:26.747
SUCH THAT ONLY ADVANTAGE.

01:46:26.813 --> 01:46:29.149
POPULATIONS CAN USE THEM. SO

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.417
THE VERY FIRST OF COURSE IS

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:31.685
TECHNOLOGY AND THIS MEANS NOT

01:46:31.752 --> 01:46:33.820
ONLY THE PHYSICAL DEVICES- HAVE

01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:35.155
BEEN ALLUDED TO BUT ALSO THE

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:36.123
SOFTWARE THAT WE REQUIRE

01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:37.958

HISPANIC ADULTS REMAIN

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:43.663
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY THAN

BIG SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION.

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:10.791
ON BEYOND HAVING A PHYSICAL

THE PREREQUISITE EXPERIENCE AND

01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:17.264
SKILLS THAT TO USE THAT

01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:18.698
REQUIRED SOFTWARE WHICH WE

01:47:18.765 --> 01:47:21.268
OFTEN CALL. DIGITAL LITERACY-

01:47:21.334 --> 01:47:22.602

I. THERE'S I'VE EVERY ENOUGH MY-

01:47:30.877 --> 01:47:31.411
THOSE FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS NOT

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:37.851
LIKELY TO USE PORTALS. BUT

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:39.152
THERE IS DATA DEMONSTRATING

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:39.920
THAT THESE WONDERFUL

ONE OF LACK OF INTEREST IT'S

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:46.693
JUST THAT WE'RE NOT DOING IT

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.361
RIGHT. ANOTHER BIG ISSUE IS

PROFICIENT. AND AFTER ENGLISH

01:48:03.443 --> 01:48:04.578

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:26.066
MOST HOSPITALS REQUIRE

01:48:26.132 --> 01:48:27.901
NAVIGATION IN ENGLISH. FURTHER

01:48:27.968 --> 01:48:29.436
MAGNIFYING THIS ISSUE IS THE

01:48:29.502 --> 01:48:31.004
VERY LIMITED SUPPLY OF LANGUAGE

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:32.672
CAPABLE PROVIDERS AND IN FACT

01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:34.407
OUR PREPARATION RESEARCH SHOWS

01:48:34.474 --> 01:48:35.342
THAT SPANISH SPEAKING

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:36.676
PHYSICIANS ARE THE MOST UNDER

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:38.411
REPRESENTED. IN THE PHYSICIAN

01:48:38.478 --> 01:48:41.514
WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA NEXT

01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:44.451
LINE. SO NOT ONLY AND NOT ONLY

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:45.652
HAVE PTIENTS BEEN AFFECTED BY

01:48:45.719 --> 01:48:47.153
PATIENT LEVEL STRUCTURAL

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:48.788
BARRIERS BUT ALSO BY- THE

01:48:48.855 --> 01:48:50.090
BARRIERS THAT THEIR PROVIDERS

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:51.291
ARE FACING AND THESE ULTIMATELY

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:52.592
AFFECT PATIENTS AND HAVE

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:54.294
AFFECTED DISADVANTAGED PATIENTS

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.196
DISPROPORTIONATELY. SO NOT

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:57.430
HAVING THE NEEDED HARDWARE

01:48:57.497 --> 01:48:59.332
OFTEN AS SIMPLE AS SAFETY NET

01:48:59.399 --> 01:49:00.767
CLINICS NOT HAVING WEBCAMS TO

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:02.202
CONDUCT THEIR VIRTUAL VISITS.

01:49:02.269 --> 01:49:04.037
AND THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION

01:49:04.104 --> 01:49:05.338
TO BUILD UP ADEQUATE EQUIPMENT

01:49:05.405 --> 01:49:06.773
INFRASTRUCTURE. SYSTEM

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.675
INFRASTRUCTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:49:08.742 --> 01:49:10.577
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:12.579
CAPACITY LIMITATIONS LIKE THAT

01:49:12.646 --> 01:49:14.180
ARE COUNTY FACILITY OUR SYSTEM

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:15.515
DOES NOT SUPPORT LAUNCHING A

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:16.650
VIDEO VISIT FROM THE CHARTER

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:18.385
AND TO THIS DAY WE ARE STILL

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:19.853
WORKING ON PROBABLY SETTING UP

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.054
VIDEO VISITS FOR PRIMARY CARE

01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:22.889
PATIENTS ARE PATIENTS. DO NOT

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:24.991
HAVE THE OPTION TO ACCESS VIDEO

01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:27.160
VISITS. EXISTING CLINIC

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:29.796
CAPACITY SO THIS IS- NOT HAVING

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:31.498
TECH SUPPORT IN MEALS THAT CAN

01:49:31.564 --> 01:49:32.599
TROUBLESHOOT DURING ISSUES

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:34.000
LAUNCHING VIRTUAL VISITS WE ARE

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:35.468
ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUES.

01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:37.037
THAT COME UP WITH TECHNOLOGY-

01:49:37.103 --> 01:49:39.739
AND MORE SO OF COURSE IN IN

01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:41.141
POPULATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:49:41.207 --> 01:49:45.445
EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE-

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:46.880
TROUBLESHOOTING. FIRST THE

01:49:46.947 --> 01:49:48.081
CONSULATE BARRIERS IN AB A

01:49:48.148 --> 01:49:49.883
STAFF TO. THESE VITAL TASKS-

01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:51.051
AND THEN LASTLY PROVIDER

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:54.387
REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES- WHICH I

01:49:54.454 --> 01:49:55.388
KNOW YOU'RE AWARE OF IS

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:56.856
CONTRIBUTING TO DISPARITIES IN

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:59.426
ACCESS NAMELY- LACK OF

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:00.894
CONSISTENCY ACROSS BEARS AND

01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:02.329
ESPECIALLY HIGHLIGHTED AT THE

01:50:02.395 --> 01:50:03.797
ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC LACK OF

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.265
PAYMENT PARITY WHICH WE'LL DIVE

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:07.367
INTO- FURTHER IN A BIT BUT-

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:08.635
THESE ISSUES REALLY HIGHLIGHT

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:17.544
SOME AREAS WE. PATIENTS FOR

01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:19.846
EXAMPLE BY LIMITING PAYMENT FOR

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:20.880
TELEPHONE VISITS BEFORE

01:50:20.947 --> 01:50:22.882
ADDRESSING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:24.451
TECHNOLOGY FOR PATIENTS IN

01:50:24.517 --> 01:50:25.919
ALREADY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:28.188
ARE ENSURING. EQUITABLE

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:32.726
ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS. MAX LINE.

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.527
SO THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN I

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:36.062
SEE HOW TELEHEALTH TOOLS COULD

01:50:36.129 --> 01:50:37.831
SERVE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:39.032
IMPROVE CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT

01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:41.301
AND IF DONE RIGHT AND THEY GET

01:50:41.368 --> 01:50:43.703
IF DONE RIGHT- IMPROVE HEALTH

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:44.771
DISPARITIES FOR UNDERSERVED

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:47.273
POPULATIONS BY MEETING THOSE

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:49.843
WHO NEED ACCESSIBLE CARE MOST

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:52.512
WHERE THEY ARE- THE GOVERNOR

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:53.646
RECENTLY NOTED IN THE CONTEXT

01:50:53.713 --> 01:50:55.248
OF VACCINATION OF FARMWORKERS

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:56.282
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD BE IS

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:57.450
ABOUT MEETING THEM WHERE THEY

01:50:57.517 --> 01:50:58.985
ARE. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN

01:50:59.052 --> 01:51:00.220
PRACTICE AS WELL AS IN THE

01:51:00.286 --> 01:51:01.821
LITERATURE IS THAT THE

01:51:01.888 --> 01:51:03.490
CONVENIENCE OF TELEHEALTH CAN

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:04.924
IN FACT LEAD TO REDUCE NO SHOW

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.059
RATES BUT THIS IS BECAUSE

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:07.060
PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:08.194
THE CARE THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:09.729
NEED AND AS A PRIMARY CARE

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:11.431
DOCTOR SO I'LL BE THE FIRST TO

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:12.899
ADMIT IF I GET A NO SHOW IN

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:14.100
THIS LIGHT IS A QUICKLY FILLED

01:51:14.167 --> 01:51:15.902
WITH ANOTHER PATIENT. I CAN

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.470
BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF OF THE

01:51:17.537 --> 01:51:18.705
EXTRA TEN MINUTES THAT I GET

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:20.473
BACK LET'S BE HONEST THAT'S

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:21.574
JUST TIME THAT I GET TO SPEND

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:23.476
ON MY IN BOX OF LABS AND EMAILS

01:51:23.543 --> 01:51:24.911
FROM PATIENTS BUT YOU KNOW

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:27.147
THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT'S BEST

01:51:27.213 --> 01:51:29.282
FOR PATIENTS DELAYED CARE LEADS

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:30.984
TO HIGHER COSTS LATER. IN THE

01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:32.786
FORM OF SPECIALS APPOINTMENTS

01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:34.521
ADMISSIONS HOME FOR THE

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:36.356
UNNECESSARY COMPLICATIONS OF

01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:37.857
CONDITIONS THAT'LL CONTINUE TO

01:51:37.924 --> 01:51:39.826
WORSEN OVER TIME THROUGH WHICH

01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:41.828
A PATIENT DELAYS CARE THIS IS

01:51:41.895 --> 01:51:43.563
NOT A THEORETICAL RISK THIS IS

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.532
WHAT WE SEE DAY IN AND DAY OUT

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:47.300
IN CLINICAL CARE- I'LL

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:49.235
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS YOU CAN

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:51.004
ASK ANYONE OF MY TRAINEES ABOUT

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:52.472
THIS DELAY IN CARE LEADS TO

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:54.441
GREATER PATHOLOGY. MORBIDITY

01:51:54.507 --> 01:51:55.642
AND YEARS OF PAYING HEALTHCARE

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:57.410
COSTS IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT

01:51:57.477 --> 01:51:59.045
BETTER PATHOLOGY IS SEEN IN THE

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:00.547
SYSTEMS OF CARE IN WHICH

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:02.148
PATIENTS ARE FORCED TO- BY

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:03.817
STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO DELAY

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:05.585
CARE AND THAT'S SOMETHING EVEN

01:52:05.652 --> 01:52:07.220
MY MEDICAL STUDENTS- KNOWING

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:09.756
REFLECT ON SO REDUCING LIMITING

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:11.524
HOW REDUCING SPENDING BY

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:13.126
LIMITING ACCESS MAYBE WORTH

01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:14.694
CONSIDERING FOR WELL THE

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:16.596
POPULATIONS WITHOUT EXISTING%

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:17.497
STRUCTURAL AND SYSTEMIC

01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:19.199
BARRIERS TO KERR BUT CERTAINLY.

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:20.834
NOT IN THESE POPULATIONS AND

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.402
WILL MOST CERTAINLY NOT LEAD TO

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:23.736
REDUCE COSTS IN THE LONG TERM

01:52:23.803 --> 01:52:24.971
AND THAT'S A DISTINCT

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:26.005
DISTINCTION THAT I LIKE TO

01:52:26.072 --> 01:52:27.273
POINT OUT THESE PATIENTS DON'T

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:34.314
NEED ANY ADDITIONAL. BARRIERS

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:35.782
TO CARE. I KNOW VALUE-

01:52:35.849 --> 01:52:36.382
IMPORTANT A HIGHER IS THE WAY

01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:37.884
IN WE SEE. SURPASSING THE

01:52:37.951 --> 01:52:38.985
AFFECTED OF WHAT A TRADITION.

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:40.820
IN PERSON VISIT MY HAVE I'M

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:41.955
SUCH AS BUYING. IN A RECENT

01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:43.456
PAPER THAT WE PUBLISHED LIKE

01:52:43.523 --> 01:52:45.191
THE PHYSICIAN BEING ABLE TO DO

01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:47.360
A HOME VISIT THE ARBITRAL THERE

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:49.529
OR AND- ALLOWING MORE TIME FOR

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:51.164
COUNSELING AND EDUCATION THAT

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:53.433
YOU MIGHT FIND IN. AN IN PERSON

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.601
VISIT AND THIS CAN BE

01:52:54.667 --> 01:52:56.603
ESPECIALLY VALUABLE IN THE CARE

01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:57.403
OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC

01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:00.106
DISEASE- AND IS HIGHLIGHTED IN

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:02.308
THE- SUPPORT BRIEF- IN THE

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.710
DETAILS OF THE BRIEF AND

01:53:03.776 --> 01:53:04.611
STUDIES I FOUND THAT

01:53:04.677 --> 01:53:05.678
TELEMEDICINE VISITS EITHER

01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:07.046
DECREASE OR DO NOT. INCREASE

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:09.015
FOLLOW UP VISITS. AN INCREASE

01:53:09.082 --> 01:53:14.087
TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND SO THAT.

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:14.654
DECREASES COSTS IN THE LONG

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:17.223
TERM. NEXT SIDE. I'M SO WE'LL

01:53:17.290 --> 01:53:18.591
LOOK AT FIRST THAT KIND OF THE

01:53:18.658 --> 01:53:21.094
LONG TERM- AS LANDSCAPE AND

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:21.895
THEN WE'LL DISCUSS SOME

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:23.229
ADDITIONAL THINGS WE CAN DO IN

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:26.799
THE INTERIM TO GET THEIR- SIDE.

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:28.835
SO A SOLUTION THAT'S GONNA SET

01:53:28.902 --> 01:53:29.769
US UP TO ACHIEVE GOOD

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:30.837
INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES WHILE

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:32.472
USING HEALTHCARE RESOURCES

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:34.374
WISELY- IS INTEGRATED

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.309
TELEHEALTH AS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S

01:53:36.376 --> 01:53:37.410
KIND OF HIS I'M FOR YEARS

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:38.878
RATHER THAN DIRECT TO CONSUMER

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:40.914
MATHIS. IN THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:42.649
WE CAN PROVIDE EFFECTIVE

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:44.484
EQUITABLE CARE TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:45.618
OF THOSE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT

01:53:45.685 --> 01:53:47.086
LIE AND TELEHEALTH WILL STILL

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:49.322
CONTROLLING COSTS. THIS TYPE OF

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:51.257
SETUP ALLOWS FOR IN PERSON CARE

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:53.193
TO BE SUBSTITUTED- BY SOME

01:53:53.259 --> 01:53:54.894
VIRTUAL VISITS AND WHEN

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:56.462
APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY PHONE

01:53:56.529 --> 01:53:58.498
WITH ITS WHICH ALONGSIDE REMOTE

01:53:58.565 --> 01:54:00.600
PATIENT MONITORING MONITORING

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:01.634
ALSO WHEN CLINICALLY

01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:03.503
APPROPRIATE. TOGETHER BRINGS

01:54:03.570 --> 01:54:05.438
TELEHOUSE PROMISE IN PROVIDING

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:07.240
BETTER MORE EFFECTIVE AND

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:08.975
EFFICIENT CARE TO FRUITION SO

01:54:09.042 --> 01:54:10.176
I'M TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

01:54:10.243 --> 01:54:11.377
LET'S SAY WE HAVE A PATIENT

01:54:11.444 --> 01:54:13.213
MISTER STEVE BARELY VERY POORLY

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:14.981
CONTROLLED DIABETES- WE CARE

01:54:15.048 --> 01:54:15.715
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT SENDING

01:54:15.782 --> 01:54:17.684
ABOUT FOR THE LONG TERM-

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:19.152
COMPLICATIONS THAT LEAD TO

01:54:19.219 --> 01:54:21.521
FOOT. AMPUTATIONS AS AN EXAMPLE

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:22.755
SO THIS IS A PATIENT THAT RIGHT

01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:24.424
NOW YOU'D ALREADY BE SEEING ON

01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:25.692
A MONTHLY BASIS BECAUSE OF THAT

01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:27.227
POORLY CONTROLLED A WHIMSY.

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:28.261
YOUR PATIENT IS HERE FOR THEIR

01:54:28.328 --> 01:54:29.796
VISIT THERE TO FURTHER BUT EXAM

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:32.031
REFORM THAT. IN SYSTEM THAT

01:54:32.098 --> 01:54:33.800
ALLOWS THEM TO ACCEPT ACCESS

01:54:33.866 --> 01:54:34.901
TELEHEALTH YOU SET HIM UP FOR A

01:54:34.968 --> 01:54:36.836
VIDEO VISIT THE NEXT TIME. THE

01:54:36.903 --> 01:54:38.271
PATIENT SEND YOU THE BLOOD

01:54:38.338 --> 01:54:39.639
GLUCOSE LOG FOR YOUR REVIEW

TELEPHONE PIECES THERE- WE TAKE

02:02:59.872 --> 02:03:01.574

TYING THIS TO AN EARLIER

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:35.441
QUESTION ABOUT HOW MUCH

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:37.309

MENTIONED AS THERE WAS A SLOW

02:03:43.649 --> 02:03:46.051
ADOPTION- IN PRIMARY CARE TO

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:48.654

DEFINITELY MORE RESEARCH THAT

02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:53.092
IS GOING TO BE- FORTHCOMING AND

02:03:53.159 --> 02:03:54.059

BOARD OF FAMILY MEDICINE-

02:04:00.499 --> 02:04:04.036
PRODUCED. A SUPPLEMENT THAT HAS

02:04:04.103 --> 02:04:08.507
A NUMBER OF STUDIES AND- AND SO

02:04:08.574 --> 02:04:10.643
THERE IS. MORE DATA THAT IS

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:13.679

YOU THAT IN THESE VULNERABLE

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:21.954
POPULATIONS- THAT IS THE

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:24.423
UNFORTUNATE- REALITY THAT OUR

02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:27.726
PATIENTS- I FACED NOT ONLY. YOU

02:04:27.793 --> 02:04:30.596
KNOW ONE ON THERE- SIDE BUT

02:04:30.663 --> 02:04:32.298
ALSO ON THE PROVIDER SIDE AND

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:34.800
SO AT THE VERY LEAST AS I WAS

02:04:34.867 --> 02:04:36.869
SAYING IN THEM IN THE DURING

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:38.204
THE TIME THAT WE ARE BUILDING

02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:40.840
OUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE- THIS

02:04:40.906 --> 02:04:43.275
THE- TELEPHONE THE ONLY-

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:44.844
ENCOUNTERS ARE GOING TO BE

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:48.214
NECESSARY IT- IT IS. I CAN'T

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:52.484
EVEN IMAGINE. HOW YOU CANNOT.

02:04:52.551 --> 02:04:54.987
REMOVE THOSE- REMOVE PAYMENT

02:04:55.054 --> 02:04:57.923
FOR THOSE AND EXPECT FOR-

02:04:57.990 --> 02:05:00.693
PATIENTS TO- NOT FURTHER FALL

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:02.761
THROUGH THE CRACKS. NO AND I

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:04.396
APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:05.865
NIGHT AND I ABSOLUTELY

02:05:05.931 --> 02:05:08.234
UNDERSTAND THAT SO. I'M CURIOUS

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:12.638
FROM FOR. IN THE COMMERCIAL

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:14.673
COVERAGE- WHY WHY SHOULD STATE

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:18.677
LOG DICTATE A MINIMUM PAYMENT

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:20.446
AMOUNT FOR TELEPHONE VISITS WE

02:05:20.512 --> 02:05:22.514
DON'T NORMALLY SET PAYMENT

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:25.918
AMOUNTS IN STATUTE SO- THAT IN

02:05:25.985 --> 02:05:26.752
THAT IT PROVIDES A PAYMENT

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:29.054
FLOOR. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS

02:05:29.121 --> 02:05:33.959
ON THE- YOU KNOW IT'S- THE IDEA

02:05:34.026 --> 02:05:36.729
IS THAT YOU ARE PREVENTING THE

02:05:36.795 --> 02:05:41.433
POSSIBILITY- THAT. THESE VISITS

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:43.969
ARE GOING TO BE- ONE THAT

02:05:44.036 --> 02:05:47.606
THEY'RE GOING TO BE- AS THE

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:50.743
COST SHIFTING OVER TO- THE

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:56.248
PATIENT- AND THAT. IF THERE IS

02:05:56.315 --> 02:05:59.118
NOT THAT PROTECTION OF THESE-

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:02.321
VIRTUAL VISITS WHICH IN FACT-

02:06:02.388 --> 02:06:06.158
HAVE ADVOCATE CAN PROVIDE THAT

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:08.894
EQUAL CARE- THEN YOU ARE

02:06:08.961 --> 02:06:11.130
MINIMIZING THAT ABILITY FOR

02:06:11.196 --> 02:06:12.831
PATIENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS

02:06:12.898 --> 02:06:14.800
THEM- AND READ THAT REALLY IS

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:17.536
THE KEY AND- YOU KNOW. THAT

02:06:17.603 --> 02:06:19.805
STANDARDIZATION IS IMPORTANT SO

02:06:19.872 --> 02:06:22.708
THAT WE ARE NOT CREATING A

02:06:22.775 --> 02:06:25.844
MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF CARE FOR

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:28.514
OUR PATIENTS. SO YOU WOULD

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:31.517
ADVOCATE FOR A PAYMENT- AMOUNT

02:06:31.583 --> 02:06:35.454
IN STATUTE. NUMBER OF PAYMENT

02:06:35.521 --> 02:06:37.589
AMOUNT IN STATUTE MORE SO THE

02:06:37.656 --> 02:06:40.192
STANDARDIZATION OF THE EQUAL

02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:43.462
PARITY TO WHATEVER- ALREADY

02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:47.232
KIND OF CONTRACTED- VISIT-

02:06:47.299 --> 02:06:50.302
PAYMENT IS- FOR AN EQUAL VISIT

02:06:50.369 --> 02:06:52.137
SO RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:54.673
TRANSITIONED OVER TO TIME BASED

02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:59.511
BILLING AND IF THE CARE THAT IS

02:06:59.578 --> 02:07:04.683
PROVIDED- IS EQUAL AND- IS

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:07.519
SIMILAR IN TIME THEN YOU THAT

02:07:07.586 --> 02:07:10.389
IS THAT THAT KIND OF- MINIMUM

02:07:10.456 --> 02:07:13.926
REQUIREMENT WOULD BE THAT THAT.

02:07:13.993 --> 02:07:14.360
WOULD BE THE MINIMUM

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:20.933
REIMBURSEMENT. THANK YOU- SO-

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.768
IF I'M A PATIENT AND JUST HAD

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:25.571
SURGERY OR GOT LAB RESULTS AND

02:07:25.637 --> 02:07:26.672
I CALL MY DOCTOR WITH THE

02:07:26.739 --> 02:07:29.408
QUESTION AND- DOCTOR CALLS BACK

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:32.411
TO CHECK ON ME WOULD YOU WOULD

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:34.079
YOU CONSIDER THAT SHOULD BE A

02:07:34.146 --> 02:07:37.082
BILLABLE ENCOUNTER. YOU KNOW

02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:38.484
THERE ARE CERTAIN SCENARIOS

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:41.353
JUST- HAS OF TOMATO WAS-

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:44.423
MENTIONING THAT ARE PART OF-

02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:46.658
ENCOUNTERS THAT WE ARE ALREADY.

02:07:46.725 --> 02:07:52.031
HAVING SO FOR EXAMPLE- WE- HAVE

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:53.732
A PATIENT A COMPLICATION JUST

02:07:53.799 --> 02:07:57.036
AS YOU SAID WE HAVE TO- AND

02:07:57.102 --> 02:07:59.605
SPEAK TO THE SPECIALIST WE HAVE

02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:01.340
TO CALL THEM BACK WITH LAB

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:03.942
RESULTS ALL OF THAT. IS BEING

02:08:04.009 --> 02:08:06.278
INCORPORATED INTO THE TIME THAT

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:08.514
IS SPENT ON THAT- GIVEN

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:10.349
ENCOUNTER SO IT'S NOT A

02:08:10.416 --> 02:08:11.784
SEPARATE BILLABLE ENCOUNTER

02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:12.851
IT'S THAT IT'S BEING

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:16.088
INCORPORATED- AND ACCOUNTED FOR

02:08:16.155 --> 02:08:19.291
IN THE LARGER AND COUNTER. SO

02:08:19.358 --> 02:08:20.993
WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH

02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:23.195
OUR SORT OF CAPITATED OR WHOLE

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:25.964
PERSON CARE MODEL BUT NOT

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:27.466
NECESSARILY IN WHAT I WAS

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:29.301
GETTING AT IS A IS A IN SOMEONE

02:08:29.368 --> 02:08:32.071
IN A FEE FOR SERVICE ATMOSPHERE

02:08:32.137 --> 02:08:34.406
WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT A

02:08:34.473 --> 02:08:38.310
BILLABLE ENCOUNTER. AND SO KIND

02:08:38.377 --> 02:08:40.446
OF THE PART OF THE COMPLEXITY

02:08:40.512 --> 02:08:43.015
WAY THINKING ABOUT- VALUE BASED

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:45.084
PAYMENT IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:47.119
NOT QUITE THERE YET- IF

02:08:47.186 --> 02:08:48.787
DESIGNED WELL- THESE

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:50.722
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS ARE

02:08:50.789 --> 02:08:52.658
CAPABLE OF DRIVING COST SAVINGS

02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:53.892
AND VALUE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:56.562
LONG TERM- BUT YOU KNOW RIGHT

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:58.530
NOW THAT LANDSCAPING CLUES MANY

02:08:58.597 --> 02:09:00.099
UNDER PERFORMING MODELS WHICH

02:09:00.165 --> 02:09:01.400
HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE THAT

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:03.602
DESIRED PRACTICE-

02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:06.672
TRANSFORMATION. AND YOU KNOW IT

02:09:06.738 --> 02:09:07.573
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

02:09:07.639 --> 02:09:08.841
SHOULD ABANDON VALUE BASED

02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:10.609
PAYMENT JUST THAT WE ARE NOT

02:09:10.676 --> 02:09:14.279
YET THERE AND- SO THIS IS- WHY

02:09:14.346 --> 02:09:15.848
IN THE INTERIM WE NEED TO THINK

02:09:15.914 --> 02:09:19.418
ABOUT HOW CAN WE- MEET PATIENTS

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:21.820
WHERE THEIR ACT- ALLOW THEM TO

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:23.489
BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR

02:09:23.555 --> 02:09:27.292
PROVIDERS IN. THE IN THE

02:09:27.359 --> 02:09:29.128
MODALITIES THAT THEY HAVE

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:32.731
AVAILABLE TO THEM- WHILE WE ARE

02:09:32.798 --> 02:09:35.134
IN THE LONG TERM THINKING ABOUT

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:38.270
HOW WE CAN- APPLY A VALUE

02:09:38.337 --> 02:09:43.775
BASED. PAYMENT SYSTEM. SO THEY

02:09:43.842 --> 02:09:45.277
ARE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER-

02:09:45.344 --> 02:09:49.615
DOCTOR MAROTTA- SAID THAT HE

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:51.416
THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE.

02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:52.918
TELEPHONE SHOULD BE TELEPHONE

02:09:52.985 --> 02:09:55.053
SERVICES SHOULD SHOULD HAVE

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:56.755
SORT OF KIND OF A SUNSET

02:09:56.822 --> 02:09:58.790
NECESSARILY- AND MAYBE A RE

02:09:58.857 --> 02:10:00.859
EVALUATION AFTER A COUPLE OF

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:03.095
YEARS- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:07.232
THAT. I THINK THAT THAT'S A

02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:09.034
REASONABLE APPROACH BUT AGAIN I

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:10.302
THINK YOU ALWAYSHAVE TO

02:10:10.369 --> 02:10:11.303
CONSIDER AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:12.571
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SEGMENT

02:10:12.638 --> 02:10:14.840
OF THE POPULATION- THAT

02:10:14.907 --> 02:10:17.476
ULTIMATELY WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS

02:10:17.543 --> 02:10:20.779
TO- THE THOSE VIRTUAL VISITS

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:22.147
THAT WE WOULD LOVE FOR ALL OF

02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:23.315
OUR PATIENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO

02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:24.650
YOU. AND I THINK THAT'S

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:25.217
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:27.653
CONSIDER AND THAT- NEEDS TO BE

02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:30.455
ACCOUNTED FOR- INCLUDING FOR

02:10:30.522 --> 02:10:34.359
THE LONG TERM- AND SO- YOU KNOW

02:10:34.426 --> 02:10:38.497
IT WE IT WOULD BE- YOU KNOW

02:10:38.564 --> 02:10:41.133
NAIVE. TO SAY THAT EVENTUALLY

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.102
WE WILL GET TO THAT POINT- WE

02:10:44.169 --> 02:10:45.637
MAY BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:47.472
POINT BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE- TIME

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:49.641
AND SO- TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:52.377
THAT- SUNSET DATE YOU KNOW WITH

02:10:52.444 --> 02:10:54.079
SOMETHING LIKE TWO YEARS. YOU

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:56.315
KNOW I THINK IT'S- GONNA BE

02:10:56.381 --> 02:10:57.916
HARD PRESSED TO BE ABLE TO KNOW

02:10:57.983 --> 02:10:59.618
WHEREWE'RE GOING TO BE YEAH IN

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:02.354
THOSE. TWO YEARS- YOU KNOW AS

02:11:02.421 --> 02:11:04.356
WE KNOW THESE CHANGES ARE AT

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:05.490
THE INFRASTRUCTURE LEVEL

02:11:05.557 --> 02:11:09.394
CHANGES- TAKE A LOT OF TIME-

02:11:09.461 --> 02:11:11.797
AND SO. YOU KNOW THINGS THAT W

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:16.134
CAN DO ON HAD HE- PATIENT SIDE

02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:18.870
TO MINIMIZE- FOR EXAMPLE AT THE

02:11:18.937 --> 02:11:21.039
OVER UTILIZATION AND THAT- THE

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:23.642
CONCERNS HAVE- HAD BEEN BROUGHT

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:24.843
UP ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE PHONE

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:28.180
VISITS SO- THINKING ABOUT-

02:11:28.247 --> 02:11:30.215
HAVING AND THE- AMBULATORY

02:11:30.282 --> 02:11:33.986
TRIAGE. ALGORITHMS WHERE YOU

02:11:34.052 --> 02:11:36.588
CAN- YOU KNOW DESIGNATE WHAT

02:11:36.655 --> 02:11:39.491
TYPE OF VISITS CAN GO INTO-

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:40.959
VIRTUAL VISITS PHONE VISITS

02:11:41.026 --> 02:11:43.228
WHAT PATIENTS NEED TO BE SEEN

02:11:43.295 --> 02:11:45.631
AND PERSON AND SO- YOU KNOW I

02:11:45.697 --> 02:11:47.966
THINK IT'S- THINKING ABOUT THE

02:11:48.033 --> 02:11:50.736
SYSTEM MORE BROADLY- AND-

02:11:50.802 --> 02:11:52.371
ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACT THAT

02:11:52.437 --> 02:11:54.506
AGAIN SOME PATIENTS- YOU KNOW

02:11:54.573 --> 02:11:58.277
VIRTUAL. VISITS WILL NEVER BE

02:11:58.343 --> 02:11:58.910
AN OPTION. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK

02:11:58.977 --> 02:12:00.779
YOU MUCH AND I YOU KNOW I

02:12:00.846 --> 02:12:02.748
COMPLETELY RECOGNIZE THAT I'D

02:12:02.814 --> 02:12:03.582
AT THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO

02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:04.850
DO IS TAKE AWAY THE ONLY

02:12:04.916 --> 02:12:06.685
MODALITY SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO

02:12:06.752 --> 02:12:10.656
BE ABLE TO. TO HAVE A VISIT-

02:12:10.722 --> 02:12:13.225
AND I RECOGNIZE THE- THE HUGE

02:12:13.292 --> 02:12:14.393
INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES WE

02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:15.794
HAVE WITH TRYING TO GET TO A

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:17.396
POINT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY.

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:18.530
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:19.998
AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY TO BE

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:22.267
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF A

02:12:22.334 --> 02:12:25.837
VIDEO VISIT OR OR SOME OTHER-

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:28.006
TYPE OF MODALITY THERE. AND

02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:29.141
EVEN ONCE YOU GET TO THAT POINT

02:12:29.207 --> 02:12:29.841
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE

02:12:29.908 --> 02:12:31.109
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:32.344
TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO DO

02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:34.746
THAT OR IN THE CASE OF OLDER

02:12:34.813 --> 02:12:37.115
PATIENTS. WHO MAY NOT.

02:12:37.182 --> 02:12:38.216
UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE

02:12:38.283 --> 02:12:40.152
TECHNOLOGY OR HAVE DEMENTIA OR

02:12:40.218 --> 02:12:42.454
OTHER OTHER HEARING ISSUES AND

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:46.291
THINGS LIKE THAT SO- SO. THAT'S

02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:48.360
THERE'S A LOT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:50.929
A LOT A LOT TO CONSIDER HERE-

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:56.268
AND- I JUST IN MY OWN MIND HI I

02:12:56.335 --> 02:12:57.169
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME.

02:12:57.235 --> 02:12:58.770
CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS

02:12:58.837 --> 02:13:00.339
PARITY BETWEEN THE TELEPHONE

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:03.408
VISIT AND ITALO TELE TELE- A

02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:05.544
VIDEO CONFERENCING VISIT. THOSE

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:07.579
IN MY OWN MIND DON'T DON'T.

02:13:07.646 --> 02:13:09.681
THEY'RE NOT EQUITABLE AND SO

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:11.016
THAT'S WHY I'M STRUGGLING A

02:13:11.083 --> 02:13:11.950
LITTLE BIT WITH THE PAYMENT

02:13:12.017 --> 02:13:13.685
ISSUE HERE BECAUSE I IT'S IT

02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:16.321
IS. IT IS A VERY THEY ARE VERY

02:13:16.388 --> 02:13:19.524
DIFFERENT AND EVEN- MR CORBETT-

02:13:19.591 --> 02:13:21.660
IN HIS CHART TALKED ABOUT YOU

02:13:21.727 --> 02:13:22.961
KNOW THE VALUE OF THE SOME OF

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:24.963
THIS IS SOMEONE IS A LITTLE BIT

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:26.898
INCONCLUSIVE AND- BECAUSE THERE

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:28.333
ISN'T A LOT OF EVIDENCE OUT

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:29.868
THERE SO. BUT I WOULD BE CLEAR

02:13:29.935 --> 02:13:30.736
I DON'T I'M NOT TRYING TO CUT

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:33.138
AND WANT TO CUT PEOPLE OFF BUT

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:34.439
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE.

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:36.041
BUT I DO HAVE THIS YEAR YOU

02:13:36.108 --> 02:13:37.776
KNOW IT'S HARD FOR ME IN MY OWN

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:40.645
MIND TO JUSTIFY IT AS PARITY-

02:13:40.712 --> 02:13:42.214
PARITY MEANS. THAT THEY'RE

02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:46.351
EQUAL. IN ANY CASE. ABSOLUTELY

02:13:46.418 --> 02:13:50.589
AND I AM- IT IS A VERY REAL

02:13:50.655 --> 02:13:53.024
CONCERN SO FOR EXAMPLE THE-

02:13:53.091 --> 02:13:54.493
EXAMPLE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP

02:13:54.559 --> 02:13:58.063
ABOUT- TO PEDIATRIC VISIT AND

02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:00.298
DOING FOR AT AN EXAM FOR

02:14:00.365 --> 02:14:01.500
ORTEGA'S MEDIA YOU CAN EXAMINE

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:04.369
IT. BABIES YEARS VIA VIDEO IT'S

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:06.505
JUST NOT POSSIBLE SO YOU KNOW

02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:08.106
PATIENT NEEDS TO BE SEEN AND

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:09.808
PERCENT SO OF COURSE THERE IS

02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:12.177
NOT GOING TO BE PARITY BETWEEN

02:14:12.244 --> 02:14:15.180
ALLEN AND ACUTE CARE VISIT FOR-

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:18.483
RULE OUT OF TIGHTEST MEDIA- AND

02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:21.319
IT OVER VIDEO OR PHONE-

02:14:21.386 --> 02:14:24.189
BIRTHDAYS IN PERSON. HOWEVER

02:14:24.256 --> 02:14:25.824
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CONTEXT

02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:26.792
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.393
IN TERMS OF CHRONIC CARE

02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:30.061
MANAGEMENT AND EXAMINE THE

02:14:30.128 --> 02:14:31.830
EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE. THAT

02:14:31.897 --> 02:14:35.367
DIABETES IS- PATIENTS RIGHT SO-

02:14:35.434 --> 02:14:38.236
WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DO AND

02:14:38.303 --> 02:14:41.072
PROVIDE THE SAME EXACT CARE THE

02:14:41.139 --> 02:14:43.875
SAME LEVEL OF CARE THAT THE-

02:14:43.942 --> 02:14:45.744
AT. THE SAME LEVEL EXPERTISE

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:48.246
THE SAME LEVEL OF TIME VIA A

02:14:48.313 --> 02:14:51.550
VIRTUAL VISIT AS WE WOULD. THE

02:14:51.616 --> 02:14:55.287
PHONE VISIT AND- YOU KNOW

02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:57.255
PHYSICIANS- ARE GOING TO BE

02:14:57.322 --> 02:15:01.259
ABLE TO APPLY THOSE TYPES OF-

02:15:01.326 --> 02:15:03.328

LITTLE BIT- PATIENTS. WE MAY

02:15:06.598 --> 02:15:08.400
NOT BE ABLE TO APPLY THAT FROM

02:15:08.467 --> 02:15:09.401
THE BEGINNING AND THAT'S WHY I

02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:10.969
THINK WE NEED TO INCORPORATE

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:12.771
THINGS LIKE ALGORITHMS THAT

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:16.274

WOULDN'T NEED TO HAVE A

02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:17.408
DISCUSSION OVER OVER THE

STATE LAW BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE

02:35:29.053 --> 02:35:31.188
ALSO NEED TO TWEAK IN FEDERAL

02:35:31.255 --> 02:35:33.590
LAW. TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN-

02:35:33.657 --> 02:35:35.059
YOU KNOW WE COULD CLINICS COULD

02:35:41.699 --> 02:35:43.200
OF THIS COULD OCCUR IF WE HAD

AN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

02:35:45.235 --> 02:35:47.571

02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:49.640
ASSOCIATION IS OPPOSED. TO

02:35:49.707 --> 02:35:50.941
MAKING THAT TWEAK SO HERE WE

02:35:51.008 --> 02:35:52.876

02:35:59.349 --> 02:36:00.317
DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSING I THINK

02:36:00.384 --> 02:36:01.885
WE NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

02:36:01.952 --> 02:36:03.620
AS TO WHY IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

02:36:03.687 --> 02:36:05.456
ISN'T HAPPENING. WE HAD A

02:36:05.522 --> 02:36:07.024
CHANGE STATE LAW TO AUTHORIZE

02:36:07.091 --> 02:36:07.991
AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT

02:36:08.058 --> 02:36:10.694
METHODOLOGY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN

02:36:10.761 --> 02:36:12.162
IT NEEDS A SMALL TWEAK TO GET

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:13.997
CMS APPROVAL. BUT IT NEVER

02:36:14.064 --> 02:36:16.100
SEEMS THE RIGHT YEAR. TO

02:36:16.166 --> 02:36:17.901
APPROACH AND REVISIT THE EIGHT

02:36:17.968 --> 02:36:20.237
PM DISCUSSION. INSTEAD WE KEEP

02:36:20.304 --> 02:36:21.638
BUILDING OFF OF WHAT I THINK IS

02:36:21.705 --> 02:36:24.374
A FLAWED PAYMENT MODEL- THE PPS

02:36:24.441 --> 02:36:27.377

02:36:27.444 --> 02:36:29.780

02:36:37.087 --> 02:36:38.122
MORE THAN A MONTH THE PAINT IN

02:36:38.188 --> 02:36:39.356

02:36:39.423 --> 02:36:40.891
MAKES TO PLANS FOR ADULTS AND

02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:42.359
KIDS I DON'T THINK A PAYMENT

02:36:42.426 --> 02:36:45.295
RANGE THAT WIDE MAKES SENSE.

02:36:45.362 --> 02:36:46.964
NOW WE'RE BEING ASKED TO EXTEND

02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:48.398
THAT FLOOD PAYMENT MODEL TO

THE GOVERNMENT SET COMMERCIAL

IS A LEVEL OF HYPOCRISY THERE

02:37:49.092 --> 02:37:50.994
THAT BOTHERS ME PARTICULARLY

02:37:51.061 --> 02:37:52.396
WHEN AMERICANS SPEND FAR MORE

02:37:52.462 --> 02:37:53.964
ON HEALTHCARE THAN ANYONE ELSE

02:37:54.031 --> 02:37:56.066
IN THE WORLD. AND ANY EFFORTS

CONTINUOUS IT COULD BE

03:03:22.057 --> 03:03:23.992
EPISODIC. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS

03:03:24.059 --> 03:03:25.527
YOU LOOK AT NEW SERVICES SOME

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT I HAVE TWO

03:03:42.845 --> 03:03:44.947
COMMENTS. FIRST WE DON'T HAVE

03:03:45.013 --> 03:03:46.248
GOOD DATA ON OUTCOMES IN

03:03:46.315 --> 03:03:47.549
HEALTHCARE GENERALLY. BECAUSE

03:03:47.616 --> 03:03:48.684
WE DON'T MEASURE AND REPORT

03:03:48.751 --> 03:03:49.718
THINGS LIKE RATES OF BREAST

03:03:49.785 --> 03:03:51.653
CANCER MORTALITY HYPERTENSIVE

03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:52.621
STROKE OR DIABETIC FOOT

03:03:52.688 --> 03:03:54.056
AMPUTATIONS. THOSE CLINICAL

03:03:54.123 --> 03:03:55.424
OUTCOMES WOULD LET US KNOW HOW

03:03:55.491 --> 03:03:55.958
WE'RE DOING BUT WE DON'T

03:03:56.024 --> 03:03:57.259
MEASURE AND REPORT THEM.

03:03:57.326 --> 03:03:58.560
INSTEAD WE MEASURE THINGS LIKE

03:03:58.627 --> 03:03:59.695
RATE OF MAMMOGRAPHY WHICH

03:03:59.762 --> 03:04:00.863
DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT

03:04:00.929 --> 03:04:02.331
THE ACCURACY OF THE STUDY OR

03:04:02.398 --> 03:04:03.932
THE RADIOLOGIST INTERPRETATION.

03:04:03.999 --> 03:04:04.767
THE RATE OF UNNECESSARY

03:04:04.833 --> 03:04:06.802
BIOPSIES ARE MISSED CANCERS ALL

03:04:06.869 --> 03:04:08.437

03:04:08.504 --> 03:04:09.538
CANCER MORTALITY IN AGGREGATED

03:04:09.605 --> 03:04:11.874
FORM. THE FLAG OF OUTCOME DATA

03:04:11.940 --> 03:04:13.308
LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO KNOW HOW
