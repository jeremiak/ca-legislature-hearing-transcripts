THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE. NO MOVING ON TO THE HEARING ITSELF TO ALLOW AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. I'LL KEEP MY OPENING REMARKS BRIEF. TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR AND TO AUDIT REPORTS. AS THE ART CONVEYED THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WAS UNPREPARED. THE PANDEMIC COST HISTORIC LEVELS OF CLAIMS BUT NOW ALMOST A YEAR LATER THE DEPARTMENT IS STILL UNPREPARED. UNPREPARED FOR PHONE CALLS UNPREPARED FOR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS UNPREPARED FOR THE RE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS UNPREPARED TO PREVENT FRAUD AND UNPREPARED TO HANDLE THOSE WHO MAY BE VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT. IT'S NO SECRET THAT ARE CONSTITUENCIES AND OUR CITIZENS ARE SUFFERING. THERE ARE UNABLE TO ADDRESS THIS EDT PROBLEM OF THEIR E. D. D. PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES IN A TIMELY MANNER. UNABLE TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AND UNABLE TO NAVIGATE THE DEPARTMENT SYSTEM AND EVER CHANGING GUIDELINES. GENERALLY OUR LOCAL STAFFS IN OUR LOCAL DISTRICT OFFICES- HAVE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF STORIES OF THE CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS THAT EXIST. WHAT WE HEAR FREQUENTLY IS IT'S EITHER GET BENEFITS OUT% FAST OR PREVENT FRAUD WE HEAR THAT FROM THE EDT WHY IS IT ONE OR THE OTHER WHY CAN'T WE HAVE BOTH OUR CONSTITUENTS DESERVE MEMBER BETTER EXCUSE ME- SENATOR LAYERED IS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE JOINT. AUDIT COMMITTEE AND I UNDERSTAND HE'S ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE SO AT THIS POINT I'LL ASK SENATOR LAYER LAYER IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ED BOTH MISTER CHAIRS- I REALLY APPRECIATED TO AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE FACT THAT I'M SHARING A HEARING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SO I WILL LEAVE A WHEN THIS IS DONE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE JOINT HEARING OF THE- JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON INSURANCE I WAS BRIEFED BY THE STATE AUDITOR ON BOTH PIECES OF THE SORT. OF THE AUDIT THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US ON THE PERFORMANCE OF CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IS SIMPLY THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE IT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS A PRIMARY LIFELINE GOVERNMENT CAN WROTE TO PEOPLE WHEN LIFE COMES DOWN HARD ON THEM IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EATING AND STARVING. AS I WAS SWORN INTO THIS OFFICE IN DECEMBER I WAS KEENLY AWARE OF THE MANY MANY CONCERNS I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE ON THE CENTRAL COAST AND FROM MEDIA REPORTS THAT ALL WAS NOT RIGHT WITH THIS CRUCIAL LIFELINE. PROGRAM THEN I BEGIN TO HEAR THE RULES. OF FROM MARKETS TO. AS THEY IN THE DISK OFF. R. Y. WOMAN WITH THE PH IS LIVING HER CAR BECAUSE PAYMENTS BEEN. CLOSER ABOUT BE REAP. AND SHE'S LOCKED OUT OF A POST OFFICE BOX. ANOTHER IS DESK FOR A TWO YEARS WORTH OF PAYMENTS SO SHE CAN KEEP A ROOF OVER HER. AND HER TODDLER'S HEAD. WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT OUR PHONE MIGHT GET CUT OFF. WHICH MEANS SHE CAN'T CHECK TO SEE IF THE DOZENS OF EMAILS AND CALLS SHE'S MADE TO D. D. D. HAVE BEEN RETURNED. THERE'S ANOTHER CONSTITUENT WHO IS OWED NEARLY TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN ANOTHER WHO IS TRYING TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BACK TO THE E. D. D. AND A MONTH LATER HIS CHECK TO THEM HASN'T CLEARED. THESE ANECDOTES JUST SCRATCHED THE SURFACE I'M SURE THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. HAS SIMILAR STORIES. THE NUMBER OF UNPAID CLAIMS. UNFAIRLY DENIED CLAIMS FROZEN ACCOUNTS AND FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTS IS STUNNING. WHAT WENT WRONG AND HOW DO WE FIX IT. I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE EIGHTY DETECTS THE HARD EVERY RECOMMENDATION WITHIN THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. MAKE NO MISTAKE YOU ARE THE PEOPLE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST HOMELESSNESS AND HUNGER THAT'S A SACRED DUTY YOU MUST NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF. AS A LEGISLATOR I KNOW LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I WILL BE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZING THIS REPORT FOR LEGISLATIVE FIXES. THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO CONSIDER PARTICULARLY AROUND THE RAMPANT FRAUD IN THE FAILURES IN THE SYSTEM. THAT IT IS COST. AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE THIS ABOUT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. THE ORDER DID AN AUDIT TEN YEARS AGO ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES. THE ORDER WAS BASED IN THE ACTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE LAST. BUT WAS COMPLETED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS SPANNED THE ADMINISTRATIONS OF THREE GOVERNORS. OF BOTH PARTIES BUT IT IS UP TO US NOW TO MAKE SURE THESE PROBLEMS ARE DRESSED- SO I HOPE THAT EDT EXECUTIVE TEAM THEIR STAFF IN THE STATE ADMINISTRATION. ALL REDOUBLE. THEIR FOCUS ON JUST TRYING TO CLEAN UP THIS CRISIS. THEY CAN PUT IN PLACE TO STRUCTURE CULTURE DDD. OF THAT CAN DO THAT AND DO IT FOR BETTER- INTO THE FUTURE BECAUSE FRANKLY THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. SO I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO GO OUT OF ORDER APOLOGIZE. FOR HAVING TO LEAVE HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- NOW WILL TURN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUDY SALAS IS THE CHAIR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE- I WANT TO POINT OUT TO ALL THE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR COMMENTS. AND QUESTIONS FOLLOWING EACH OF THE PANELS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND OF COURSE THE FIRST PANEL WILL BE THE STATE AUDITOR HERSELF IN HER STAFF SO THEY'LL BE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE HEARING. MISTER SALAS GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY AND THANKS AND ROULERS- FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING WE APPRECIATE- THE VICE CHAIRMAN HERE AS WELL- FOR TODAY'S JOINT HEARING WITH THE- WITH THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE AND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS TWO IMPORTANT A LOT OF REPORTS RELEASED JUST LAST WEEK- YOU AND I. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY ALONG WITH THIRTY EIGHT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTED THE STATE AUDITOR CONDUCT AUDIT WORK BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. OUT OF CONCERN FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY OBTAINING THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. WE HAD CONCERNS AT THAT TIME YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS AFTER THE PANDEMIC. AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURN BEGAN. ABOUT EDIE'S ABILITY TO PROPERLY DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY ISSUE PAYMENTS AND PROVIDE BASIC CUSTOMER SERVICE. AT THE TIME THE EXTENT OF THE FRAUD ASSOCIATED WITH UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WAS JUST STARTING TO COME TO LIGHT. WE ALL WANT DVD TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND HOPE TO HEAR REASONS TODAY TO BELIEVE THAT EDS TURNED A CORNER. AND CALIFORNIANS ARE RECEIVING THE BENEFITS AND SERVICES THEY DESERVE AND THE PUBLIC FUNDS ARE BEING PROTECTED. NOW REPORTS. RELEASED LAST WEEK CERTAINLY IDENTIFIED MANY SERIOUS ISSUES AND GIVE US GREAT CONCERN. THE STATE AUDITOR IDENTIFIED MANY DEFICIENCIES RELATED TO ED'S ADMINISTRATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. LARGE REPORTS CONCLUSIONS WERE DISTURBING. THE EXTENT OF THESE DEFICIENCIES COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MINIMIZE HAD THERE BEEN SOME ADVANCE PLANNING AND BETTER PREPARATION. THE REPORT FOUND THAT EDIE WAS WHOLLY UNPREPARED FOR AN ECONOMIC RECESSION WHICH LEFT SO MANY CALIFORNIANS WAITING WEEKS. OR MONTHS FOR THEIR BENEFITS WHILE DESPERATELY TRYING TO CALL PHONE SYSTEM MORE LESS THAN 1% OF CALLS WERE BEING ANSWERED. WELL I RECOGNIZE THE SURGEON UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS WAS UNPRECEDENTED AS DEPARTMENT THAT OVERSEES CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM EDT SHOULD BE WELL AWARE THAT RECESSIONS ARE CYCLICAL. OCCURRING REGULARLY AND THAT PLANNING TO INCREASE STAFFING HANDLE INCREASED WORKLOADS AND SERVICE CALIFORNIANS SEEKING THEIR BENEFITS DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. IS A NECESSITY IN FACT. SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES WERE HIGHLIGHTED BY THE AUDITOR AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT RECESSION. EDT WAS ALSO CLEARLY. TO GUARD AGAINST FRAUD WHICH RESULTED IN AT LEAST TEN POINT FOUR BILLION AND FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS GOING TO CLAIMANTS WITH UNCONFIRMED IDENTITIES INCLUDING% INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT RECENTLY. THE RELEASE FIGURES FOR MEDIA IDENTIFIED AN ADDITIONAL NINETEEN POINT FIVE BILLION AND POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT. I BELIEVE CALIFORNIANS ARE FRUSTRATED THEY'RE INFURIATED THEY'RE FED UP THEY WANT A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR THEM AND I'M HOPING TODAY'S HEARING WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE CLARITY BUT A ROAD MAP FOR HOW THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED AND FIXED MOVING FORWARD AND WITH THAT. I'D APPRECIATE THAT'S MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MISTER SALAS. AND- YOU MENTIONED A ROAD MAP AND- THIS IS A PERFECT- SEGUE TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE GOVERNMENT THAT HAS LAID OUT A ROADMAP FOR US. AND FOR EDT- THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. AND OUR NEXT PRESENTATION IS FROM. ELAINE HOWELL THE STATE AUDITOR AND ONE OF HER STAFF MEMBERS BOB HARRIS. MISAO ARE YOU READY. YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER DALY BEAUTIFUL GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIR SALAS AND DALY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING US TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT REPORTS THAT WE ISSUED LAST WEEK ON THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- BOB HARRIS IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ONCE WE GET TO THE Q. ONE DAY I'M GOING TO STEP THROUGH IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL STEP THROUGH THE KEY FINDINGS THAT WE HAVE IN EACH OF THE TWO REPORTS. AND FOCUSED- PRIMARILY ON THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS- I KNOW MY OFFICE MADE IT SOME DOCUMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOING TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THESE DOCUMENTS I'M JUST GOING TO GO OVER THE FIRST PAGE THERE'S THREE DOCUMENTS. THE FIRST. ONE- EIGHT MORE REFERRING TO. IT TIES TO THE FIRST THREE THAT WE IS LAST TUESDAY. AND REALLY FOCUSED ON PROCESS- THE ABILITY TO. CLAIMS THE BILL TO. OUR CALLS COMING IN AN IN PRAISE COMING IN FROM CLAIMANTS ARE THROUGH THEIR CALL CENTER. AND- EDIE'S. PROB AND BEING ABLE TO DO THOSE THINGS AND REASONS WHY AND AS MISTER SALAS INDICATED AND CERTAINLY SENATOR ARE LAYERED INDICATED IN MY OFFICE ISSUED A REPORT BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN LOOKING AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS IT'S CALL CENTER PERFORMANCE AND WE IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES BACK IN AND TWENTY TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN WE ISSUED A REPORT AND AGAIN- THAT WAS. YOU KNOW SUBSEQUENT TO THE RECESSION AND R. ETT HAD YOU KNOW- HEADS AS SURGEON. CLAIMS DURING THE RECESSION- AND HAD STRUGGLED TO DEAL WITH THAT CERTAINLY THE PANDEMIC IS MAGNIFIED EVEN MORE AS FAR AS THE SIZE OF THE SERBS THAT CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED- THIS LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY AND CONTINUES TO. SUFFER FROM HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. BUT AS AS MISTER SALAS INDICATED ONE OF FIRST KEY ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT IS THAT EDT WAS NOT PREPARED ARE THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT INSTITUTED SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BASED ON SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN ALSO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD PUT. EDT AND THAT CATEGORY CONSIDERED HIGH RISK WHICH MEANS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS FOR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD PROCESS. AND GET PAYMENTS OUT WITHIN TWO TO THREE WEEKS THEY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE EXPECTATIONS BACK IN THOSE DAYS- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS EXPECTING EDT TO IMPROVE WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS EDT- AND CLEARLY THEY THEY CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE AND THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE THAT HAVE. TO CERTAINLY WERE EXACERBATED THIS OP PANDEMIC UNFORTUNATELY- SO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATINS WE HAVE AND I'LL GET TO THAT LATER BUT WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT EDT NEEDS TO HAVE A RECESSION PLAN A PLAN FOR- YOU KNOW ONCE WE GET PAST THIS PANDEMIC THIS STATE AND COUNTRY WAIT WE DEAL. WITH RECESSIONS EVERY FIVE TO SIX YEARS YOU'VE GOT A PLAN FOR THOSE SIX. ENNEDI WHY NOT FOR THAT SO THAT WAS THE FIRST KEY ISSUE AREAS THE FIRST REPORT. WE ALSO FOCUSED THE CALL. AND I MEMBERS HAVE HAVE OVER WE CAN IN REPORT THAT. NOT ONLY DID THE CALLS- STRONG QUITE A IT AGAIN DEMIGODS. OR PERFORMANCE FROM THE PAST- BACK INTO A WE DID THAT THE CALLS WAS. ONLY ABLE TO HIM PROBABLY 1560% OF THE CALLERS THAT WERE COMING AND WE'RE ABLE TO REACH AN AGENT. ARE WE WERE SUGGESTING THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME AUTOMATION THERE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVEMENT THEY NEEDED TO TRACK WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING. ALSO THAT PERHAPS THEY COULD PUT SOME FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS UP ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY COULD HAVE PRE RECORDED MESSAGES AVAILABLE TO CLAIMANTS CALLING IN. A TO HOPEFULLY ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT CLIENTS HAVE WITHOUT THAT PERSON HAVING TO REACH AN AGENT. WE FOUND THE SAME SITUATION- WHEN WE CONDUCTED THIS AUDIT ON THIS LAST YEAR- THE CALL CENTER PERFORMANCE WAS DISMAL IT WAS DOWN TO ONE PERCENT. EVEN AFTER THE GOVERNOR. BUT THE STRIKE AND THEY HIRED ADDITIONAL STAFF THE ONE TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF STAFF WORKING IN THE CALL CENTER. THEIR PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REALLY SERVE CALIFORNIANS WELL. PART OF THE PROBLEM- SIMILAR TO ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN TRAINING TOOK A LONG TIME A LOT OF THESE. AGENTS THAT WERE HIRED TO ASSIST WITH THE CALL CENTER THEY WERE THINKING THEY WOULD NEED NINE TO THIRTEEN MONTHS THEY TRIED TO STREAMLINE IT DOWN TO NINE MONTHS THAT'S STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL GET TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST CLAIMANTS WHO ARE ARE ARE TRYING TO GET A CLAIM FILED TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHY THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEIR BENEFITS YET. SO SECOND ISSUE AREAS CALL SO. EDT REALLY HAS CA. TO THEY ARE NOT MEASURING- YOU KNOW FIRST KALRA. THAT'S A INDUSTRY BEST. ARE WE REACH. THE CLAIMANTS. WENT THEY ARE ABLE TO REACH AN AGENT AND HOPEFULLY GET THEIR THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND THEIR ISSUE RESOLVED SO THAT THEIR CLAIM CAN GET PROCESS AND THEY CAN GET THEIR FUNDS. ON THEIR BENEFITS TO THEM. SO THOSE WERE THE FIRST TO KEY ISSUES- ARE STRUGGLING TO PROCESS CLAIMS CONTINUING TO STRUGGLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS. A LOT OF BDD SYSTEM- WAS A MANUAL PROCESS. NEARLY 50% OF THEIR CLAIMS WERE ENDING UP IN A MANUAL. PROCESS WHERE THEY'RE HAVING TO VERIFY IDENTITY DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY ETCETERA- WITH THE USE OF ID ME WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY. TWENTY THAT AUTOMATION I'VE GOT A LOT BETTER AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. BUT WHAT THEY ALSO DID IS SUSPENDED CERTAIN- REQUIREMENTS- THAT ARE TYPICAL UNDER THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. PART OF THAT. IS BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL. DEMI PLEINEMENT ASSISTANCE. WHICH WAS FORCED EMPLOYED INDIVIDUAL END OF WHO WORK. NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ON A- ON THE DON'T HAVE GOOD. WAGES SO SOME OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS EDT WAS ABLE TO SUSPEND- DECIDED TO SPEND AND NOT ALLOW THEM TO PROCESS CLAIMS MORE QUICKLY. BUT THEY STILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO RESOLVE CERTAIN ISSUES- THE THIRD ISSUE THAT WE HAVE OUR LAST ISSUE I'M SORRY FOR THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN THE REPORT WORK RELATED TO SOME DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE TO SPEED UP CLAIMS AND IT'S THE BALANCE BETWEEN AS A CHAIRMAN- MISTER DALY SAID. IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN TRYING TO PREVENT AS MUCH FRAUD AS POSSIBLE. ANNOUNCING THAT WITH GETTING PAYMENTS OUT TO CLAIMANTS ONE FIVE EDT DECIDE TO- THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE A- TO SPEND. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IDENTITY VERIFICATION- SO THE FIRST ISSUE WAS RELATED TO ELIGIBILITY WHERE THEY SUSPENDED THE ELIGIBILITY AND NOW THEY'VE DETERMINED THAT. BASED ON- US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR LEADING EDT NOW WE'RE DIRECTING EDT IN DECEMBER YOU CAN'T SUSPEND ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO GO BACK NOW AND REASSESS ALL OF THOSE CLAIMS THAT YOU SUSPEND IT AND THERE'S OVER TWELVE MILLION DETERMINATION ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION ISSUES HI TO ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMANTS ARE THAT EDT WILL NOW IN ADDITION TO ITS REGULAR WORKLOAD HAVE TO GO BACK AND DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS AND IN SOME CASES THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE TO PAY. OUR BENEFITS BACK WITH STATE CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE TO TRY TO RECRUIT BENEFITS SIMILAR SITUATION UNDER TRADITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AN UNEMPLOYED INDIVIDUAL HAS TO CERTIFY. EVERY TWO WEEKS. CHANYU THEY REMAIN ELLA THERE THEY'RE A AND ABLE TO ABLE AND AVAIL TO WERE. THERE SO MANY NO SIR. EVERY TWO WEEKS- THAT WAS ALSO. NOW FOR ABOUT EIGHT WEEK WINDOW EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC. MARCH TWO EARLY MAY AGAIN THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BECAME AWARE AND SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU NEED TO REINSTATE THE REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT THOSE CERTIFICATIONS. JUSTIN THAT EIGHT WEEK PERIOD- ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CLAIMANTS OUR AFFECTED SO THAT'S ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD NOW THAT EDT IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND I KNOW THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT. REQUIRING THESE INDIVIDUALS- TO NOW SUBMIT THAT CERTIFICATION ON THAT BY WEEKLY CERTIFICATION- THAT THEY'VE BEEN SEEKING WORK AND THEY'RE ABLE AND AVAILABLE FOR WORK SO THEY MADE TO WISH TO DECISIONS THERE. I'M TRYING TO GET PAYMENT OUT TO CLIENTS BUT YOU ALSO HAVE AN ISSUE NOW WHERE YOU'VE GENERATED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD THAT EDT NOW BECAUSE YOU STOL SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU CAN'T SUSPEND THOSE TO. THE ELIGIBILITY AND THE- THAT THE CERTIFICATIONS ARE YOU NOW HAVE TO GO BACK AND MKE SURE THAT THE ALL OF THOSE FOLKS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE BENEFITS THAT THEY RECEIVE. SO THOSE WERE THE FOUR KEY AREAS. IN THE FIRST REPORT. I'M SO THAT IS ATTACHMENT A- THE JUST THE FIRST PAGE- AND NOW I'M GONNA GO ON TO. ATTACHMENT BE R. DOCUMENT BE WHICH IS REPORT THAT WE IS ON. OF WEEK. AND THAT ONE- FOCUSED ON FRIDAY. TO AND JUST. I THAT AGAIN IS MAY THAT UNFORTUNATELY OPEN UP STATE FORTIFY. PAYMENTS POTENTIALLY FOR. CERTAINLY PAYMENTS- AND WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR ISSUES IN THAT REPORT I WANTED TO GO THROUGH. THE FIRST IS THAT EDT BEINGS TO REACT OR TO BE PREPARED AGAIN. TO PREVENT AND DETECT FRAUD. IN THE MENU I PROGRAM PARTICULARLY WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY COMING INTO CALIFORNIA TO BENEFIT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE WERE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. WARRANTY ALL STATES NOT JUST STATE CALIFORNIA BUT ALL STATES IN APRIL AND MAY THAT FRAUD IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE YOU'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. ALL OF YOUR TOOLS THAT YOU USE TRADITIONALLY AND EVEN BE MORE DILIGENT ABOUT TRYING TO PREVENT FRAUD. IN THE IN THE SYSTEM- BECAUSE THEY'RE AT THE POTENTIAL IS EXTREMELY HIGH. UNFORTUNATELY EDT DIDN'T ESTABLISH OR TO START WORKING ON A COUPLE OF THINGS UNTIL MONTHS INTO THE PANDEMIC. THE FIRST ONE WE IDENTIFIED WAS ABOUT FOUR MONTHS IN WHEN THEY STARTED. STOPPING PAIN AMOUNTS. SPECIAL STATEMENT THE SPECIALIST. AND THEN ABOUT SIX INTO THE US TO OR SEVEN INTO PANDA- AROUND. IS WHEN THEY SEE- RAISING IT OR TRY TO CLAMP DOWN ON. PLANES THAT WHEN OUT TO. ARAB SO AS YOU SEEN IN THE NEW NOT MANY OF YOU KIND. HOW HAVE. YOU EVER. TWENTY THIRTY ON AND MAILBOX ADDRESS PEOPLE DON'T HERE NONE OF THE IN IN MY HOW. AND FOR BENEFITS SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IT TOOK EIGHTY MONTHS INTO THE PAN. TO TRY TO PUT MORE. OR THAT. SAID AND SUSPEND PAYMENTS TO THE- SUSPECTS AB. WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE WORK WE ARE FOR UP AND SELECTED OF THE- ADDRESSES THAT NEEDED THE HAD I. THAT WORSE IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE PAYMENTS HAD ACTUALLY STOPPED AND UNFORTUNATELY WE FOUND THIS AS FAR IN. AS A EARLY DECEMBER THAT- AT LEAST TWO OR THREE THE ADDRESSES THAT WE LOOKED AT I'M CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS AND ABOUT THIRTY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS HAVE BEEN PAID OUT TO ONE PARTICULAR ADDRSS THAT WAS SUSPICIOUS. SO AGAIN EIGHTY WAS VERY SLOW TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE CONTROLS THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED. SOME OF THESE- FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT. TO INDIVIDUALS WHO EITHER STOLE THE IDENTITY OF CALIFORNIANS- OR WERE JUST ABLE TO DEFRAUD. THE SYSTEM ON AROUND. CHU HI. SAID THE WE ADDRESS IN THE AUTUMN. THE YOU I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH ONE IS THE- COMMUNITY COORDINATION WITH BANK OF AMERICA. IN FREEZING ACCOUNTS- THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN B. OF A AND ET D. ETT DIRECTED BE OF VALUE TO FREEZE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCOUNTS- THE ISSUE WE HAVE WITH THAT IS THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN FOR. FOLLOWING THROUGH AND ANALYZING EACH OF THOSE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCOUNTS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS WHERE WE NEED TO GET THAT ACCOUNT UNFROZEN SO THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN ACCESS HIS OR HER BENEFITS- EDT TO- TO THE POINT AND WHEN WE ISSUED. AUDIT REPORT DIDN'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST TO BE ABLE TO TRACK HOW MANY ACCOUNTS WERE FROZEN BECAUSE EDT MADE SOME DECISIONS TO STOP PAYMENT ON CERTAIN ACCOUNTS- BE IF THEY HAD CERTAIN ACCOUNTS THAT WERE FROZEN AGAIN THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH. SO EDT WAS NOT ABLE TO GIVE US A COMPREHENSIVE LISTING UP HERE ALL THE ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN FROZEN HERE'S THE STATUS OF OUR REVIEW OF THOSE ACCOUNTS HERE'S OUR COMMUNICATION WOULD BE A VERY DIRECTING THEM TO UNFREEZE CERTAIN ACCOUNTS. SO THAT LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS CAN GET TO THOSE BENEFITS SO THERE THERE'S QUITE A BIT AND NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH RESPECT TO. COORDINATION COMMUNICATION WITH BFA ON TO MAKE SURE THAT LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR BENEFITS. THE SECOND CITY. IS THE MATCHING WITH. DATA RELATED IN CARS AND- THERE ARE UP THIRTY FIVE SO. THAT DO THIS TYPE OF MATCHING. CERTAINLY WERE THAT THEY USE. ARE DATED. HAD NOT BEEN DOING THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING HAVE DONE SOME OF THE- USING A- TO LOOK AT OUTLOOK. NINE CARS. DAY BUT WHEN WE CONDUCTED THIS. EDT HAVE NOT BEEN THAT PROCESS- UNTIL THEY IN INTO A CONTRACT LATE IN TWENTY. I WAS IN A- OF TWENTY YEAR ALL I'M SURE WHERE WHEN THE DA'S CAME OUT. WITH SOME INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD OBTAINED FROM THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR WHERE LABOR HAD ACCESS OR- OBTAIN DATA FROM E. AND DONE SOME OF THE CROSS MATCHING AND IDENTIFY. THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS THAT WERE TIED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCARCERATED- CALIFORNIA EDT HAS NOW. ESTIMATED AS WE EXPLAIN IN THE REPORT ABOUT EIGHT TEN. DOLLARS HAS BEEN PAID OUT ON CLAIMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS INCARCERATED EITHER AT THE STATE LEVEL OR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NOW ET DE NOW DOES HAVE A CONTRACT. IN PLACE WITH THE VENDOR TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS- SOME OF THAT INFORMATION BE ABLE TO DO THE CROSSMATCH I KNOW THEY NOW HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH CDCR- TO BE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED IN STATE FACILITIES- BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS TO THAT. AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE WITH WITH THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE. AND THEN THE LAST AREA-VERY QUICKLY IS EDT JUST ITS OVERALL- EFFORTS TO PREVENT DETECT FRAUD EDT IS A LARGE ORGANIZATION IT'S A HUGE STATE AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA- HAS MAJOR PROGRAMS YOU AYE PROGRAM IS SIGNIFICANT D. I. IS A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMMING CALIFORNIA. WITH RESPECT TO THE U. I. PROGRAM WE WANTED TO LOOK TO SEE. HOW DO THEY- EXERCISE THEIR FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION EFFORTS- AND IS VERY DISJOINTED THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT UNITS WITHIN EDT THAT HAVE DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO FRIDAY. SUMMER INTENSIFYING POTENTIAL FRAUD THEN THEY HAVE TO COMMUNICATE TO ANOTHER UNIT WITHIN DDD TO MAKE SURE STOP PAYMENT ON THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM IS STOP IT'S NOT. THERE ISN'T AND OVER ARCHING GROUP OR UNIT WITH ANY TV THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE ALL THAT COORDINATION COMMUNICATION HAPPENS SO WE HAD A GRAPHIC IN THE REPORT AND IT BUT IT'S- IT'S VERY COMPLEX I WANNA SAY CONFUSED. BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SPAGHETTI THING BECAUSE ALL THESE DIFFERENT UNITS HAVE DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES IN WE'VE GOT ERRORS GOING BACK AND FORTH AND IT'S JUST. IT'S NOT VERY WELL COORDINATED VERY DISJOINTED SO EDT NEEDS TO COME UP WITH- AN OVERALL STRUCTURE FOR. WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE ALL. THAT FRAUD PREVENTION TO ACTION COMMUNICATE IS A- AND APPROPRIATE INEFFICIENT. THE OTHER IN. NOUS OF THE TOOLS THAT THEY USE SO IF THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TOOLS. WHAT BEST PRACTICES TELL YOU IS. LET'S ASSESS THOSE TOOLS AND DETERMINE HOW MUCH PRIDE ARE WE ABLE TO PREVENT OR IDENTIFY- AND THEN YOU KNOW STOP PAYMENT ON THOSE PARTICULAR CLAIMS LET'S CONTINUE TO USE THOSE TOOLS AND INVEST IN THOSE. IF THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS THAT AREN'T AS EFFECTIVE BUT THEY'RE IMPACTING LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. ARE BY NO FREEZING THEIR ACCOUNTS ARE STOPPING PAYMENTS TO THEM. THE WE NEED TO DO THAT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. IT MAKES SENSE TO CONTINUE TO USE THAT TOOL SO THEY KNEW YOU NEED TO DO THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS UP THE TOOLS. ON TO DETERMINE WHICH ONES ARE MOST EFFECTIVE. SO THAT'S THE TWO REPORTS A VERY HIGH LEVEL WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO GET INTO MORE DETAIL THE PACKETS WE PROVIDED TO YOU. PROVIDE MORE DETAIL BEHIND THOSE KEY ISSUES WITH OTHER GRAPHICS TO ILLUSTRATE EACH OF THE ISSUES. THE NEXT THING I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES IS THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE NOT ONLY TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE HAVE A VARIETY RECOMMENDATIONS WE MAY T. D. THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH THOSE- WHAT WE HAVE. SUGGESTED THE LEGISLATURE DO IS REQUIRE EDT TO DEVELOP A RECESSION PLAN. WHAT TOGETHER LESSONS LEARNED LEARN FROM WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH A PANDEMIC LEARN FROM WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH DURING THE LAST RECESSION IN 200-072-0008 TWO THOUSAND NINE. BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE THAT THAT CONSIDERS WE HAVE A SURGEON CLAIMS HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT DO WE NEED TO MODIFY ANYTHING IN OUR PROCESSES. WE NEED TO PULL BACK FROM OTHER AREAS WITH ANY DVD WE NEED TO HIRE TEMPORARY STAFF YOU NEED TO HAVE KIND OF A CONTINGENCY. PLANNING OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE. HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO REACT WHEN YOU START SEEING A SURGEON CLAIMS YOU SEE IT WORK WE'RE ENTERING INTO A RECESSION. OUR UNEMPLOYMENT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GOING TO GO UP WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE PEOPLE REACHING OUT TO US WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO. HELP THOSE FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WAS A KEY ISSUE AND WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IT ONCE THE LEGISLATURE HOPEFULLY GETS THAT IN STATUTE EDT COMPLETES THAT FIRST RECESSION PLAN WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF THE OF. THE ENACTMENT. DATE OF THAT PARTICULAR STATUTE. THAT'S THE APPROACH AND THEN ADAM. EVERY THREE YEARS AFTER. THEY'VE COMPLETED A RECESSION PLAN LET'S REFRESH THAT PLAN MAKE SURE. THAT WE HAVE CONSIDERED EVERYTHING WE NEED TO CONSIDER WITH RICK AGAIN REGARD STAFFING PROCESSING CLAIMS ETCETERA. THREE YEARS MAKES SENSE BECAUSE AT BASED ON RESEARCH WE SAW. RECESSIONS OCCUR BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX YEAR CYCLE SO EDT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY LOOK AT THEIR PLAN AT LEAST TWICE. YOU KNOW IN BETWEEN. TYPICAL CYCLE FOR RECESSIONS- WE'RE ALSO ASKING EDT REPORT ON ITS WEBSITE THE SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY'S CLAIMANTS MAYBE NOW NOTIFIED BY ADD THAT THEY WERE OVERPAID AND THEY HAVE TO RECOUP MONEY BACK. OR THOSE THAT CLAIM AND HAS TO PAY MONEY BACK TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT EACH REPORT ON ITS WEBSITE EVERY SIX MONTHS. THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS AT THE EVENT THAT A FIGHT THAT HAVE BEEN OVERPAID HOW MUCH THAT THE NOTICES HAVE BEEN PUT OUT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO RECOUP FROM INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS AN OPTION FOR EDT IF A CLAIMANT YOU KNOW SUBMITS- A HARDSHIP- APPEAL BASICALLY SAYING I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THESE THESE FUNDS BACK EDT DOES HAVE I THINK A TWO YEAR WINDOW. TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION THEY CAN. THEY CAN- WAVE THAT REPAYMENT BUT AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER MANUAL PROCESS THAT EDT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEIR WORKLOAD IN THE EVENT THEY THEY NOTIFY PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN OVERPAID AND THOSE FOLKS. YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY FILE A HARDSHIP APPEAL THAT I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THESE FUNDS BACK CAN YOU JUST WAIT WAIT THE OVERPAYMENT- SIMILAR TO THE RECESSION. WHICH I EDT NEEDS TO ALLEGE SO REQUIRE IMMEDIATE PUT TOGETHER. GROUP OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS- I BEGAN TO IDENTIFY LESSONS LEARNED. THAT WILL FEED INTO THEIR ABILITY PUT TOGETHER THIS RECESSION PLAN- GET A REPORT DONE BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- CERTAINLY- THERE'S A LOT THAT THEY STILL NEED TO DO THIS YEAR WE'VE GOT A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EDT. TO ADDRESS SOME OTHER CLAIMS PROCESSING ISSUES- THERE FRAUD ISSUES THEIR CALL CENTER ISSUES AND WE HAVE SPECIFIC TIME LINES. IN EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TDD SO I DON'T WANT MEMBERS TO THANK FOR WE'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TO. OFFER YOU NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE PRBLEMS. ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION- IS RELATED TO CROSS MATCHING- INCARCERATION DATA AGAINST A CLAIMANT INFORMATION CLAIMS DATA INFORMATION. AND WE'RE SUGGESTING THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO DO THAT ALSO REQUIRE. YOU KNOW STATE ENTITIES LIKE CDC ARE AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO COOPERATE AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO EDT THAT PDP NEEDS TO DO THAT CROSS MATCHING. THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT TO BE IN STATUTE IS WHEN EDT OUR WORK TRY TO WORK IT WORK IT OUT WITH CDCR THIS LAST YEAR- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD TO GIVE SEIZE YOUR PERMISSION TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO EDT. WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE IT CLEAR IN STATUTE THAT THIS CROSS MATCHING IS EXPECTED AND CDCR IS EXPECTED TO SHARE THAT. THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION WITH EDT SO THEY CAN DO THAT CROSS MATCHING- AND THEN THE LAST TWO ISSUES ARE RELATED TO FRAUD. LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRING EDT IT IT'S AND IT'S ANNUAL REPORT IT SUBMITS AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE- ABOUT FRAUD IN AND HOW MUCH IS DETECTED AT CETERA. BUT WE WANT EDT TO. EXPLAIN AND INCLUDING THAT ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TOOLS THAT THEY USE THE ANALYSIS OF THOSE TOOLS WHICH ONES ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHICH ONES ARE THEY GOING TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN WHICH ONES ARE THEY GOING TO. YOU KNOW NO LONGER USE BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE OF AN IMPEDIMENT DOWN THEN AFTER DETERRENT WITH RESPECT TO FRAUD- HOW TO MEDITATE IN. GETTING THEIR PAY. SO THE OTHER THING THAT WE WANT EDT TO DO AND AGAIN THIS IS IN THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ANNUALLY ON THE CROSS MATCHING- HOW SUCCESSFUL HAS THAT CROSS MATCHING BAND- HOW MANY CLAIS THAT THEY IDENTIFIED HOPEFULLY. AND IN MOST CASES WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THOSE WOULD BE BLOCKED PAYMENTS PAYMENTS THAT NEVER GOT OUT THE DOOR I TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IN INCARCERATED AND OBVIOUSLY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS. I'M SO THOSE ARE THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE- AS FAR AS THE PRIDE AND THE EFFECTIVENESS. ASSESSING THOSE TOOLS WHAT WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO DO IS REQUIRE EDT BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THEN EVERY TWO YEARS THEREAFTER- ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE TOOLS AND REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE NOW WE SAID JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHAT WE ALSO HAVE INCLUDED IN THAT RECOMMENDATION EDS. THEY HAVE TO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE AN UPDATE BY JULY OF THIS YEAR. SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL JANUARY TO BE ABLE TO INQUIRE FOR MEDIA OKAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REPORT TO US IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ON HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING AS FAR AS DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION TOOLS- WHERE YOU ADD ON THAT ARE YOU GOING TO MEET THAT. JANUARY ON DEADLINE. THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO EDT NOT GONNA GET INTO SPACE DETAILS UNLESS MEMBERS ARE ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE- RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO CLAIMS PROCESSING- MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS I SAID A FEW MINUTES AGO. INCLUDE TIMELINES WE HAVE SOME THINGS WE WANT NEED TO DO IMMEDIATELY WORKING WITH BFA. DO YOU GET A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF- FROZEN ACCOUNTS START TRACKING THOSE ACCOUNTS START MONITORING THE PROGRESS OF ASSESSING THE VALIDITY OF THOSE ACCOUNTS AND RELEASING THOSE FUNDS TO LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING EDT GET DONE BY MARCH OF THIS YEAR. OTHERS BY JUNE OF THIS YEAR- AND THE INTENSE THERE WAS TO GIVE YOU THE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT STILL HAD IT. WITHIN THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR- SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND MY OFFICE CONTINUE TO. CAN CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED IN OVERSIGHT. HOPEFULLY TO ENSURE THAT HE DOES IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WE'VE MADE WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS PROCESSING THE CALL CENTER AND CERTAINLY THERE AT THEIR FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION EFFORTS. WITH THAT- GERMAN SALICIN AND- DALY WE'RE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I HAVE BOB HARRIS AVAILABLE ALSO YOU'LL SEE HEATHER KENDRICK'S NAME ON THE SCREEN- SHE WAS- STAFF COUNSEL WORKING ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT SO IF THERE'S ANY ISSUES. ARE RELATED TO YOU ANYTHING FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE SHE- SHE ALSO WILL BE A CALL ON HER TO ASSIST AS WELL. SO. WITH THAT MEMBERS I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU MISS FOR. YOUR OUTSTANDING SUMMARY OF THE OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT ARE. THAT WE'RE ALL FACING HERE- THEN FOR YOUR EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATIONS- THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE WITH US IN- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE WE HAVE A OUTSTANDING ATTENDANCE- THIS MORNING OF ALL GIVE A CHAIR SALAS FIRST TRACKING ANY QUESTIONS HE'D LIKE TO ASK MISSILE AND THEN WILL. OPEN IT UP TO THE FLOOR HERE FOR MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS GO AHEAD MISTER CHAIR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER DALY LANDAU I THINK WE HAVE IN THE QUEUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND SENATOR BACKER AFTERWARDS- JUST. THREE QUICK QUESTIONS- MATTER MONITOR THANK YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK THAT YOU GUYS OF THAT I KNOW WE'VE BEEN COMMUNICATING OVER THE MONTHS ON THIS BUT JUST- REALLY QUICKLY- WHAT. BASED OFF THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE DONE WHAT WAS EDIE'S REASON FOR NOT HAVING A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IN PLACE. ESPECIALLY AS YOU OUTLINED. SOME OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN. IDENTIFIED FOR OVER A DECADE BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN- CAN YOU GIVE US. WHY YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN FOR FROZEN THE COUNCIL OR THE PRISONER FRAUD. OR THE CALL CENTER ISSUES. THAT WHAT WAS OUR STATED REASON. I'M GONNA ASK BOB HERE IS TO HELP IN A SECOND MY UNDERSTANDING IS AND WE DISCUSSED THIS IN THE REPORT BRIEFLY IS EDT WHY IS WORKING ON A RECESSION PLAN- BUT THEY HAD WAITED QUITE A LONG TIME I MEAN THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS I SAID. ACTUALLY HAD EDT AND THEN AT RISK CATEGORY BACK IN TWENTY TEN BECAUSE OF THEIR POOR PERFORMANCE AND PROCESSING CLAIMS- AND THEN OF COURSE OUR AUDIT CAME OUT IN MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN. EIGHTY WAS REALLY STARTING TO WORK ON A RECESSION PLAN I HAVEN'T COMPLETED IT IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY AND THE PANDEMIC HIT NAY BASICALLY PUT IT ON THE SHELF. ON WITH RESPECT TO BE OF A- THAT AGAIN I WILL REFER TO ADD HAVE BOB HARRIS ASSIST BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY HEAR SPECIFICS FROM EDT AS AS YOU ARE AWARE WE MENTION IN THE REPORT. THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES- AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AT A HEARING LAST FALL- THE FORMER DIRECTOR WAS SUGGESTING THAT HE BE OF A WAS DOING A LOT OF THIS. AT ITS OWN DISCRETION THAT WAS NOT NECESSARILY TRUE- BUT WE CERTAINLY ARE CONCERNED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A PLAN. ON HOW THEY WERE GOING TO ADDRESS FROZEN ACCOUNTS PARTICULARLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS ARE AND TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THEIR ABILITY TO RELEASETHOSE ACCOUNTS ON FREEZE THOSE ACCOUNTS AND RELEASE THOSE PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO. DESPERATELY NEEDED THEM- BUT I'M GONNA ASK. BOB IF HE HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO OFFER. SO BAD SURE SALAS CHAIR DEAL MEMBER THANK YOU NAME'S BOB HARRIS. WITH STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE- I GO OF COURSE EVERYTHING THE STATE AUDITOR JUST SAID SHE'S ENTIRELY CORRECT I WOULD OFFER A COUPLE OF OTHER THOUGHTS ONE WHEN IT COMES TO THE GENERAL. LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE RECESSION PLAN. EDV AND SHARED WITH US THAT BETWEEN THE END OF THE GREAT RECESSION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SEVERAL. DIFFERENT INITIATIVES TO TRY AND IMPROVE. ITS PROCESSING OF CLAIMS- INTRODUCING YOU AYE ONLINE IS IT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT. BUT I WELL THAT'S ALL. NECESSARILY NOT NECESSARILY UNTRUE THEY PAY DID MAKE CERTAIN CHANGES TO THEIR PROCESSES THAT IS STILL SHORT OF A COMPREHENSIVE RECESSION PLAN. THAT WOULD FOR EXAMPLE. BUT SPEAK TO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SCALE UP YOUR OPERATION WHEN YOU ARE IN MORE DEMAND THAN YOU ARE. IN A YOU KNOW A GOOD ECONOMIC YEAR SO. IT'S NOT TO SAY THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE REPORT THEY WERE WELL SHORT OF THE TYPE OF PREPAREDNESS AND PLANNING. THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO HAVE DONE GIVEN THAT THEY KNOW. RECESSIONS HAPPEN ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO. SCALE UP THEIR OPERATION BUT SERVE MORE CALIFORNIANS DURING THE RECESSIONARY TIME THAN THEY DO DURING A NON RECESSIONARY TIME. FINALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BANK OF AMERICA I WOULD OFFER AS A ANOTHER EXPLANATION. THE STATE AUDITOR REFERRED EARLIER TO. THE ED'S DISJOINTED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING FRAUD PREVENTING AND DETECTING FRAUD WE SIGN NO CLEAR. OR CONSISTENT POINT OF CONTACT FOR WOULD BE COMMUNICATING WITH BANK OF AMERICA WHICH I THINK ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO. A LACK OF PREPAREDNESS AND PLANNING TO ADDRESS FROZEN. BANK ACCOUNTS IN A TIMELY FASHION. GOT IT THANK YOU PRESHEAF THAT I MEAN THAT. JUST SOUNDS TO ME THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO DO THAT QUESTION I KNOW THAT THEY'RE LISTENING AND WE HAVE THEM ON A LATER PANEL- LET ME JUST ASK AT. THE ADDITIONAL QUESTION DID HE DID HE GIVE A REASON FOR SUSPENDING THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS WHICH LED TO A LOT OF THE FRAUD. YES SO. EDT AT THE DIRECTION OF AGENCY SECRETARY SUSPENDED THOSE ELIGIBILITY. DETERMINATIONS IN AN EFFORT TO EXPEDITE PAYMENT CALIFORNIANS- SO EIGHT ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION WOULD SLOW DOWN PAYMENT. FIVE BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE MORE STAFF TIME TO REVIEW THE POTENTIAL ELIGIBILITY CONCERNS- IT'LL REQUIRE BACK AND FORTH THE CLAIMANT CONSENSUALLY- TO. MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM SO. THAT IS CERTAINLY A MORE TIME CONSUMING. TASK THAN JUST ISSUING THE PAYMENT WITHOUT MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. THE INTENTION WAS TO PAY PEOPLE. THEIR BENEFITS MORE QUICKLY. BUT AS YOU NOTED. THAT DID LEAVE THE EDT MORE VULNERABLE TO FRAUD- BECAUSE THEY WERE PAYING PEOPLE WITHOUT KNOWING. FOR CERTAIN THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. GOT IT SO IN YOUR FINDINGS YOU FOUND THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT THEY SUSPENDED THESE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THEY WOULD BE OPENING THEMSELVES UP. BUT DECIDED TO ACCEPT THAT RISK. THERE'S NO CLEAR MENTION OF THE INCREASED FRAUD RISK IN THE AGENCY SECRETARY'S DIRECTIVE THAT I CAN RECALL ANYWAY- IT WAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON. WE NEED TO SPEND THESE DETERMINATIONS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE PAYMENTS IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION. GOT IT AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION AND THEN I'LL DEFERRED BY COLLEAGUES MAYBE COME BACK FOR ADDITIONAL ONES BUT WANTED TO TOUCH UPON THE CALL CENTERS BECAUSE I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HERE- ALLOCATED RESOURCES NEEDED DE HIRED AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED- STAFF MEMBERS BUT- LOOKING AT THE AUTO REPORT. YOU SEE. ONLY A MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF CALLS ANSWERED- DID EDT GIVE A REASON WHY THAT WAS OR WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU SAW. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ACTUALLY HELP THE EFFICACY RATES AT THE CALL CENTERS FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. WELL AGAIN I WOULD POINT TO THE LACK OF PREPAREDNESS AND LET ME UNPACK A LITTLE BIT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT AS THE STATE AUDITOR INDICATED EARLIER IN HER PRESENTATION. NGUYEN EDT ONBOARDED ITS NEW STAFF THE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR IT THERE- MOST HELPFUL TEAR IF YOU OTHER EPR AGENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST WITH THE WIDEST RANGE OF- CALLER PROBLEMS. THAT TRAINING PROGRAM WAS THE SLIMMED DOWN VERSION WAS NINE MONTHS LONG. SO IF IT TAKES YOU YOU KNOW FROM THE POINT OF HIGHER TO NINE MONTHS LATER TO BE YOU KNOW FULLY TRAINED AND ONBOARDED INTO BEING ABLE TO ASSIST CALLERS WITH. PRETTY MUCH ANY OF THEIR ISSUES THAT MEANS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST THEM. IN A MORE EXPECT EXPEDITIOUS FASHION EARLIER ON IN THE PANDEMICS OF THAT'S THAT'S ONE PROBLEM AND THEN THE SECOND PROBLEM WAS ET DE. DID ON BOARD OF. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO. ANSWER THE PHONES THAT HAD NOT THE BACK THAT POSITION THAT CLASSIFICATION- THAT TYPE OF CALL CENTER AGENT HADN'T EXISTED PRE PANDEMIC THEY CALL THAT WE CALL IT IN OUR- AUDIT REPORT THEIR TIER ONE AGENTS. EDT PROVIDED THEM RELATIVELY QUICK TRAINING TO GET THEM ON THE PHONES. MORE QUICKLY THAN THEIR EPR AGENTS. BUT THAT TRAINING WAS FAIRLY LIMITED IT WAS TO RESOLVE MINOR ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES WITH SOMEONE'S ONLINE ACCOUNT AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE NOT NECESSARILY TO HELP SOMEONE WITH THEIR CLAIMS SO IT TOOK EIGHTY ADDITIONAL TIME. TO PROVIDE THOSE TIER ONE AGENTS ADDITIONAL TRAINING THAT COULD ALLOW THEM TO ASSIST CLAIMANTS WITH. LIKELY WHAT MOST OF THEM WERE CALLING ABOUT WHICH ISN'T A PROBLEM WITH THEIR YOU Y. CLAIM. GOT IT I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S STRIKE TEAM INITIALLY SAID ABOUT 1% OF THE CALLS LESS THAN 1% OF THE CALLS WERE ACTUALLY- ANSWERED. AND REALLY ANSWERS EVEN BEING DELIVERED OR CONSTITUENTS- EVEN AFTER THIS INFUSION. HOW MUCH DID THE NEEDLE MOVES. RIGHT SO IT WAS NO LESS THAN 1% CALL RATE IS FROM EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC. IT'S FROM THE- MARCH TO APRIL TIME FRAME AND THAT IS REALLY THE HEIGHT OF THE CLAIM ACTIVITY. IN THE CALL ACTIVITY INTO THE CALL CENTER. AS YOU GET INTO THE LATER STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC AND THEN PACKAGE HEY THIS IS ON ON PAGE THREE. AFTER THOSE ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING THE GRAPHIC AS YOU GET INTO THE LATER LATER STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC- IS THAT. THERE IS AN UPWARD TECH WHICH WE RELATE TO IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CALLS ANSWERED. WE RELATE THAT TO PEOPLE FINALLY YOU KNOW BECOMING AVAILABLE TO HELP PEOPLE ON THE PHONE- IN THE PRIMARY CONSTRAINT ON ATVS. NUMBER OF CALLS ANSWERED IS THEIR STAFFING SOMEONE CAN ONLY ANSWER SO MANY CALLS PER DAY. AND HE HAS OR DOESN'T HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE SO THEY'LL STAFF AS MANY AS THEY HAVE. YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE HELPFUL THE CLAIMANTS. AND THEN THAT IS THE PRIMARY CONSTRAINT ON THE NUMBER OF CALLS THAT CAN ANSWER. SO THEIR CALL PERCENTAGE RATES DO GO UP THERE MARGINAL. THE PERCENTAGE OF CALLS ANSWERED. IS ALSO AFFECTED BY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CALLING AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE TOWARDS THE LATER STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC. THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER UNIQUE CALLERS CALLING THE CALL CENTER AS WELL. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT- I'M GONNA PAUSE THERE AND ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES US QUESTIONS I KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER IN THE ROOM- THAT HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WITHOUT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRS- JUST ASK A QUESTION OBVIOUSLY- LOT OF FRIED YOU THERE'S A SERIOUS SERIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. THERE BEEN PEOPLE CAUGHT UP. IN THE IN THE FRAUD OR TRYING TO CORRECT THE FRAUD PART OF THIS SO THEY GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. FOR WOMEN IN MENDOCINO COUNTY- I WAS A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO WAS TOLD YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HER BENEFITS BECAUSE SHE'S IN JAIL. SHE'S NOT IN JAIL SHE'S NEVER BEEN IN JAIL SHE'S GOT NOTHING MORE THAN A SPEEDING TICKET. WE CAN'T RESOLVE THAT SO SHE CAN HAVE TO GET SOME SORT OF AFFIDAVIT FROM THE FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO PROVE SHE'S NOT IN JAIL. AND SHE CAN'T GET THROUGH. ON A YOU KNOW SHE'S GONNA SHE'S BEEN TOLD SHE CAN GET AN APPEAL BUT- IT'S GONNA TAKE AWHILE. I'VE GOT ANOTHER GENTLEMAN. WHO FOR. MONTHS TRYING TO GET BENEFITS GOT BENEFITS AND THEY WERE SUSPENDED- YOU CAN'T IT TOOK HIM ANOTHER SIX WEEKS TO FIND OUT THAT HE COULD. FILE AN APPEAL. HIS APPEAL IS UNTIL MAY. IN THE MEANTIME IS SLEEPING IN A CAR. IN A STATE PARK PARKING LOT. SO WHILE WE HAVE HE HAVE HE WAS GETTING BENEFITS SO WHILE WE HAVE DONE THEY WERE MAKING EFFORTS TO CUT DOWN ON THE FRAUD WE'RE CATCHING NINE REAL PEOPLE UP IN THIS THAT ARE NOT FRAUDULENT CLAIMS SO IS THERE MY QUESTION IS DID EDT OPERATES FOR A PLAN TO EXPEDITE FIXING SOME OF THOSE. THOSE THINGS BECAUSE LIKE WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT GETTING WE WERE PRETTY GOOD TO GET MONEY TO PEOPLE IN WHO WERE INCARCERATED. BY SOMEONE WHO SAID THAT YOU WERE HERE WE GOT SOMEONE WHO'S NOT INCARCERATED BEING TOLD HE'S INCARCERATED THANK HAS TO WAIT FOR MONTHS TO GET A CLAIMS ADJUDICATOR SO IS. MY POINT IS. WHAT IS EDIE'S PLAN TO HELP. FIX THE OTHER THE POWER FOR THE PENDULUM SWUNG THE OTHER WAY THE AFFECTING OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES. CHECK WITH RESPECT FAMILY MEMBER TO THE ED'S PLANS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP PERHAPS THAT THEIR- BENEFITS STOPPED WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BANNED CERTAINLY WE NOTE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT EIGHTY DURING IN FACT THAT BANK OF AMERICA IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT- I WOULD DEFER TO EDT IN TERMS OF. HOW EXACTLY SOMEONE SHOULD. SHOULD GO ABOUT TRYING TO GET THE SYSTEMS WE DID NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE APPEALS PROCESS THAT YOU REFERRED TO. BUT THIS IS THE TYPE OF- THE IMPACT THAT HAPPENS IF YOU'RE NOT REGULARLY ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR FRAUD PREVENTION TOOLS. A REGULAR ASSESSMENT GOING BACK YEARS AND YEARS NOW. WOULD HAVE ALLOWED EIGHTY D. TO DETERMINE THAT IT. MORE FREQUENTLY THAN IT SHOULD SWEEPS UP LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS IN ITS FRAUD PREVENTION EFFORTS IF IT HAD BEEN DOING THAT ANALYSIS- BLEEDING INTO THE PANDEMIC. THEN HOPEFULLY AND IDEALLY IT WOULD HAVE FINE TUNE THOSE FRAUD PREVENTION TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES SO THAT- AS FEW AS POSSIBLE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS WERE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THEM AND THEN ALSO. HOPEFULLY PLANNING AHEAD FOR HOW TO EXPEDITIOUSLY HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUGHT UP- BUT I WOULD I WOULD DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR PRECISELY HOW PEOPLE SHOULD. ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL SITUATION. ALL RIGHT SIR WE'VE HEARD FROM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD- WILL I SEE A LOT OF MIKE'S UP WILL GO TO SENATOR BAKER NEXT HE PUTS MIKE UP FIRST GO AHEAD SIR. GREAT THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING ON THIS- PRETTY WITH NO TECHNOLOGY SOME IS RUN A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THIS IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE. IT REALLY STARTS WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT PROCEDURE MISSILES ASKING ABOUT. THE PHONES AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE HEARD. TWENTY TWO EVEN TODAY FOR CALLING HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF TIMES. A HUNDRED EMAILS AND NOT GETTING A RESPONSE. AS I WANT TO COME BACK THAT THE MINUTE I WOULDN'T START THOUGH WITH- REPORTED EIGHT HUNDRED TEN MILLION. WAS WENT TO INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. THE OTHER NINE POINT SIX BILLION IS BEING REPORTED AS FRAUD. BUT IN REALITY YOU SAY THAT THESE ARE PAYMENTS WENT UNCONFIRMED INDIVIDUALS SO OTHER THAN NINE POINT SIX BILLION. HOW MUCH DO YOU BELIEVE WAS ACTUALLY FRAUDULENT. SO THAT THAT WILL. THAT'S AN ASSESSMENT THAT ATV WILL NEED TO DO IN THE COMING MONTHS- THE REASON WE'RE CALLING THAT. TENSELY FRAUDULENT IS BECAUSE EDT ITSELF CONSIDERS AN UNCONFIRMED IDENTITY TO BE AN INDICATOR OF POTENTIAL FRAUD- CERTAINLY WE INDICATE THE REPORT. THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHERE SOMEONE WILL. THE UNABLE TO CONFIRM THEIR IDENTITY WITH THE TV OR CHOOSE NOT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH CONFIRMING THEIR IDENTITY AND THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY- FRAUD BUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IS NOT KNOWN TO US BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IN TIME IS NOT KNOWN EDT THAT AS THE WORK IN FRONT OF THEM COMING. WE SAID THEY STOPPED ONE POINT SIX MILLION PAYMENTS TO UNCONFIRMED INDIVIDUALS HOW COME THE OTHER FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD THOUSAND YOU IDENTIFY WENT THROUGH. RIGHT SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS LIKELY AND I'LL STEP THROUGH A COUPLE OF THEM ONE IS THAT AT. AS A STATE AUDITOR INDICATED EARLIER- ET DE HAD A LARGELY MANUAL PROCESS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC FOR- APPLYING STOP PAYMENTS TO POTENTIALLY. FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. WE TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT THAT'S THE FIRST STEP THE EDT TRUCK IN IN JULY. TO CHANGE ITS BROAD APPROACH- WHICH IS YOU KNOW FIVE POINT SIX MILLION CLAIMS INTO PANDEMIC THAT AUTOMATED THAT STOP PAYMENT PROCESS SO THAT IT WAS NO LONGER- STAFF WHO HAD TO MANUALLY REVIEW SOMETIMES OVER A THOUSAND- SUSPICIOUS CLAIMS PER DAY. AND APPLY THAT STOP PAYMENT MANUALLY SOCERTAINLY BETWEEN THE TIME EDT DETECTED. CERTAIN CLAIMS MAYBE- SUSPICIOUS OR POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT TO THE TIME THOSE STAFF WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO APPLY. THE STOP PAYMENT TO THE CLAIM PAYMENTS COULD GO OUT THAT'S ONE EXPLANATION. ANOTHER EXCELLENT. I IN PARTICULAR A STARK ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT TEN POINT FOUR BILLION- THAT WE ESTIMATE WAS POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT A BILLION OF THOSE DOLLARS. WERE PAID OUT BECAUSE OF A DELIBERATE DECISION BY EDT MANAGEMENT TO STOP USING A FRAUD SAFEGUARDS. WE TALK ABOUT THAT IN OUR WATER REPORT WHERE WE DESCRIBE THAT EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH. EDT MANAGEMENT WAS TRYING TO STREAMLINE THEIR PROCESS SEES TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE STUFF CLOGGING UP THEIR SYSTEM AND STOPPING PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY MISUNDERSTOOD. THAT THE VALUE OF A PARTICULAR FRAUD SAFEGUARD THEY THOUGHT THAT IF THEY STOPPED APPLYING. THIS STOP PAYMENT ALERT- TWO CLAIMS WHERE THEY HAD UNCONFIRMED IDENTITIES IF THEY STOPPED APPLYING THAT STOP HIM OR THAT SOMETHING ELSE IN THERE IT SYSTEM ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS WILL BACK THEM UP AND STILL- STOP PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT TO THOSE CLAIMS UNTIL THEY RESOLVED. THE IDENTITY OF THE CLIMATE. UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT WHEN THEY WAVE THAT STOP PAYMENT ALERT WHEN THEY STOPPED REPLYING TO THOSE CLAIMS. THEY PAID A BILLION OF THE TEN POINT FOUR BILLION. TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE IDENTITIES THEY COULD EVENTUALLY NOT VALIDATE. IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE THAN THAT WE TALK IN THE REPORT ABOUT HOW THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THAT WENT OUT THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS EDT THAT BROKE FAVORABLY FOR THEM FOR THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WENT TO CLAIMANTS WHOSE IDENTITIES WERE EVENTUALLY CONFIRMED- WHICH GIVES COMFORT THAT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS. BUT THE BULK OF IT ONE BILLION WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE DECISION TO STOP JUST STOP APPLYING. A KEY FRAUD PROTECTION THAT MEASURE. THAT'S RIGHT BUT THE OTHER EIGHT BILLION COULD HAVE GONE TO LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS IS THAT CORRECT. AND THAT'S WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW AT THIS POINT YOU ARE CORRECT YES AND THAT IS% WHAT YOU NEED YOU WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE. AS IT BEGINS TO ASSESS WHETHER IT OVERPAID CLAIMS OKAY THAT'S RIGHT WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW BILLION IS. UNMATCHABLE TWO BILLION IS JUST THAT YOU KNOW UNEXPLAINABLE BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE CLEAR IT'S BEEN REPORTED AS ALL AFFRONT WHEN YOU'RE REALLY YOU'RE SAYING THE OTHER EIGHT BILLION COULD HAVE GONE TO LEGITIMATE FOLKS. YOU JUST IT JUST MAY WANT TO UNCONFIRMED ADDRESSES CORRECT. I THINK WE SHOULD BE CLEAR WHEN YOU. RIGHT IT WENT TO CLAIMS FOR WHICH I EDT CANNOT CONFIRM THE IDENTITY OF THE CLIMATE AND YES WE DESCRIBE IT NOT A REPORT AS POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS. OR JUST A WRAP UP BACK ON THE CUSTOMER SERVICE A POINT- AND I MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS AND LIVE EVENTS INDUSTRY- THEIR PAYMENTS WERE FROZEN THEY'VE CALLED THEY'RE STILL NOT GETTING. THROUGH WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION YOU SEEN HERE THAT WE'RE NOT USING BEST PRACTICES FOR MANAGING THE CALL CENTER AND APPRECIATE WHAT THE ORDER SAID ABOUT DOING A SORT OF START STOP CONTINUE WHAT TOOLS THEY CAN USE IN THE FUTURE TO PREVENT THIS- BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE CAN BE DONE RIGHT NOW OTHER THAN MORE BODIES. TO HELP THE CALL CENTRE ISSUE. SURE SO CERTAINLY THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIND MORE PEOPLE ANSWERING THE CALL CENTER TO ALLOW THEM TO ANSWER MORE CALLS SO AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THAT. THE PRIMARY CONSTRAINT IS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ANSWERING THE PHONES. AD THEIR MAXIMUM CAPACITY FOR HOW MANY CALLS THEY CAN ANSWER EVERY DAY SO THAT THAT IS THE MOST IMMEDIATE BANG EDT CAN I CAN DO BUT- AS WE MENTIONED IN THE AUTO REPORT. AT IT'S ALSO IMPOTANT THAT WHOEVER'S ANSWERING THAT PHONE IS. TRULY AND GENUINELY ASSISTING THE PERSON WITH THEIR ISSUE THE REASON WHY THEY'RE CONTACTING EDT SO THAT YOU'D BE AND- I'M NOT HAVE THAT PERSON HAVE TO CALL BACK AGAIN A SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH TIME. WHICH PUTS A STRAIN ON THE CALL CENTER SYSTEM. SO AGAIN YOU'RE CORRECT THAT IN THE MOST IMMEDIATE TERM THEY CAN ENSURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO STAFF THAT CALL CENTER APPROPRIATELY WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. BUT IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY- UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING. SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE STREAMLINED QUICK HIT TRAINING TO THEIR STAFF. FOR HOW TO ASSIST PEOPLE WITH THAT. AND THEN MEASURE WHETHER THEY'RE ACTUALLY RESOLVING ISSUES WITH ON THE FIRST PHONE CALL. THANK YOU JUST- THIS IS THE LINE HOW- IN ADDITION TO THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE CALL CENTER- ONE OF THE THINGS WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT YEARS AGO WAS THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE FOLKS YOU KNOW ASK FOR A CALL BACK SO I CAN'T GET THROUGH BUT I CAN LEAVE MY INFORMATION AND ASKED FOR A CALL BACK THE OTHER THING IS HAVING PRE RECORDED MESSAGES. PRE RECORDED INFORMATION THAT A CALL OR CAN LISTEN TO AND HOPEFULLY THAT RESOLVES THEIR PARTICULAR- QUESTION- SO WE ARE SUGGESTING IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ET THEY IMMEDIATELY DEVELOP THOSE PRE RECORDED MESSAGES THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO THAT WITH OUR PHONE SYSTEM THEY LOST THAT FUNCTIONALITY WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED THIS VIRTUAL- CONTACT US SO THAT THEIR COLLARS COULD BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC- COLORS COULD BE AT HOME WORKING REMOTELY- THE VIRTUAL I THINK IT'S CONSERVE CALLED VIRTUAL. CONTACT SO- SOME OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PHONE SYSTEM WAS LOST THEY NEED TO REINSTATE SOME OF THAT LIKE THE PRE RECORDED MESSAGES THE ABILITY TO OPT FOR A CLAIM% AND TO LEAVE A MESSAGE SAYING I NEED A CALL BACK FROM SOMEONE- SO THAT THAT READ REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CALLING MULTIPLE TIMES OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING BLOCKED THEY'RE NOT EVEN GETTING THROUGH TO THE SYSTEM WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY. TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CALLS CONTINUALLY COMING INTO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE AS WE STATED IN A REPORT ON THIS WAS TRUE NOT TEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE PEOPLE CALLING CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH TO AN INDIVIDUAL THEIR BLOCK STATE THEY CAN'T THEY DON'T EVEN TALK TO ANYONE THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH THE SYSTEM SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THEY COULD DO IMMEDIATELY IN ADDITION TO WHAT- MR HARRIS SAID AS FAR AS- ADDING ADDITIONAL STAFF. BECAUSE SOME OF THE STAFF AS HE MENTIONED- THESE TIER ONE INDIVIDUALS ARE ONLY RECEIVED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TRAINING AND IN MANY CASES. THOSE INDIVIDUALS COULDN'T HELP THE PER CHEN WHO WHO. WERE ABLE TO GET TO AND TALK TO THEM THE CLAIMANT TALK TO THEM. AND IT WAS A CLOSE 230% OF THOSE CALLS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION AND HAD TO REFER THAT. TO IT. AND ALL THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD CALLED IN I'M GONNA HAVE TO REFER THIS TO SOMEONE WHO IS MORE EXPERIENCED AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU WHICH AGAIN. IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR CLAIMANTS WHO FINALLY GOT THROUGH. PERHAPS AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS NOW GETS TO SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP THEM AND CERTAINLY THAT PERSON AT EDT IS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO ASSIST PEOPLE. SO WE DO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE THINK EDT NEEDS TO IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY- AND THEN A COUPLE OF OTHER. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO IMPLEMENT BY MARCH OF THIS YEAR AND WE THINK THAT WILL HELP. IN RESOLVING SOME OF THE ISSUESTHEY'VE HAD WITH THE CALL CENTER PERFORMANCE. ALL RIGHTS A- LOT OF MIKE'S UP- WILL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TIM GRAYSON NEXT AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE MEMBERS. IF YOUR QUESTION PERTAINS. SOME QUESTIONS WILL BE BEST ANSWERED BY EDT. REPRESENTATIVES THEMSELVES IF YOUR QUESTION PERTAIS TO MISSILES AUDIT- BY ALL MEANS ASK THOSE QUESTIONS NOW BUT- IT JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND BECAUSE THERE WILL BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES SO AFTER EDT PRESENTS THEIR- DOES THEIR PRESENTATION GO AHEAD MR GRAYSON THANK YOU CHAIR DALY AND SURE SALAS AND ALSO- THANK YOU TO THE STATE ORDERED FOR A THOROUGH AND COMPREHENSIVE REPORT JUST A FEW QUESTIONS HERE- THE FRAUD WHAT WAS FRAUD MORE PREVALENT WITH ONE PARTICULAR PAYMENT METHOD OVER ANOTHER FOR INSTANCE A CARD VERSUS A PRINTED CHECK- I DON'T KNOW IF- YOU INCLUDED THAT IN YOUR AUDIT. AND THEN ALSO- I GUESS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT IMPACT WOULD- THERE BE TWO BOEING DIRECT DEPOSIT AND HOW THAT WOULD ADDRESS FRAUD THE SECOND MAIN QUESTION OF. THE SIDE THE FIRST TO. BY UNITS IN YOUR PRESENTATION- AT THE VERY BEGINNING REFERENCED TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REPORT. AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU MADE- WERE A IN YOUR AUTO AT THIS TIME WAS THEIR CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS MADE. WHETHER THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AND THE REASON WHY I ASK THAT. WELL IT IS BECAUSE IN THIS REPORT THIS TIME WAS IT AS EASY AS IN SOME CASES JUST COPYING AND PASTING YOUR RECOMMENDATION ALL OVER AGAIN. AND HOW ARE WE ABLE TO INSURE THAT WE DON'T JUST RELIVE THE CYCLE FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND YOUR EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU'VE MADE IN YOUR REPORT GOAL I'M IMPLEMENTED AND WE FACE THIS AAIN DOWN THE ROAD SO HOW BEST CAN WE ENSURE THAT YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT IT TO GO IN ORDER OF YOUR QUESTIONS ONE NO WE DIDN'T LOOK SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT DATA EDT GAVE US- IDENTIFY. METHOD OF PAYMENT IN TERMS OF WHAT I. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POTENTIAL FRAUD- HOW THEY GOT PAID OUT SO TO HAVE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION FOR YOU ON THAT AND I THINK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT DIRECT DEPOSIT. I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE PRACTICE SOME OTHER STATES ENGAGE IN WHERE THEY ALLOW FOR PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THEIR BENEFIT PAYMENTS THROUGH DIRECT DEPOSIT I'M CERTAINLY AWARE THAT AT LEAST THERE'S BEEN ONE BILL INTRODUCED THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF SUCH AN OPTION- BUT WE MAKE NO DIRECT. AUDIT FINDING ABOUT- THAT THE PROS OR CONS OF MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN WE HAVE NO DATA ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY GOT PAID OUT. WITH RESPECT TO THE CALL CENTER RECOMMENDATIONS THERE SIMILAR TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE IN THE PREVIOUS REPORT. AND SILVA COPIED AND PASTED NECESSARILY BUT THEY ARE IN THE IN THE SPIRIT OF. THE SAME RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE FROM PAST AUDIT REPORTS AND REALLY THAT COMMON THREAD I EDT NEEDS TO BE. ADHERING TO THE BEST PRACTICES. THAT ARE COMMONLY ACCEPTED FOR HOW TO RUN A CALL CENTER OPERATION. SO THAT IT IS THE MOST HELPFUL TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO USE THAT- WE HAD ASSESSED THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE ONES FROM THE PRIOR AUDIT REPORT BUT WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE ARE BACK IN THIS TIME. THAT HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH CONTINUALLY IMPLEMENTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THEY MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING IN THE PAST. THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT IT WE SAID THIS IS GOOD. THE SATISFIES OUR RECOMMENDATION. WHAT WE DIDN'T SEE WAS THE FOLLOW THROUGH WE DIDN'T SEE THEM CONTINUING TO ADOPT. AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON THOSE BEST PRACTICES AND THAT'S WHERE- IF THEY ARE LEFT THEMSELVES UP IN SOME PRETTY KEY DEFICIENCIES. WITH RESPECT OVERSIGHT CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW UP WITH EDT ABOUT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS- I THINK OUR FIRST RESPONSE IS DUE BACK FROM EDT- NINETY DAYS FROM. FROM LAST WEEK SO JUST ABOUT NINETY DAYS FROM TODAY. ABOUT HOW ARE THEY DOING WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDATION. AND WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE AFTER WE'VE DONE OUR QUICK ASSESSMENT OF THEIR PROGRESS- TO YOU AND THE OTHER MEMBERS AS TO WHAT YOU EAT WHAT PROGRESS EDB IS OR IS NOT. MAKING TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS. AND JUST ONE TO ADD TO THAT- IS THAT- WE MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO PUT BE PUT INTO STATUTE. LIKE THE CROSS MATCHING REQUIREMENTS THE REQUIREMENT TO PUT TOGETHER RECESSION PLAN AS AS BOB INDICATED THEY THEY HAD MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CALL CENTER AND SOME OF THEIR CLAIMS PROCESSING WHEN WE REVIEWED THEIR RESPONSES TO US- AFTER WE ISSUED THE MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN REPORT BUT WE DID A FOLLOW UP AUDIT IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWELVE WHICH WAS BEYOND. BEYOND ONE YEAR. WHICH TYPICALLY IS THE CYCLE IN. SIXTY DAYS SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR IS A TYPICAL CYCLE FOR AND IT'S-T. TO REPLY TO US RESPOND TO US AS TO WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHEN WE HIT THE ONE YEAR MARK THINGS ARE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD- THEY WERE STILL. IMPLEMENTING SOME NEW CHANGES TO THEIR THEIR CALL CENTER THEY WERE ALSO IMPLEMENTING SOME OTHER AUTOMATION- EFFORTS SO WE DECIDED TO GO BACK IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWELVE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE FOUND THAT AS MR HARRIS INDICATED SOME OF THOSE THINGS HAVE SLIPPED BACK SO THERE WASN'T CONSISTENT CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT- AND FOLLOW THROUGH AND. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT EDT HAD. A SENSE REAP TO US DURING. THE FIRST FIRST YEAR AFTER THAT MARCH TWENTY ELEVEN REPORT SO I THINK THE DISTINCTION NOW WILL BE. MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRING SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE LIKE WOULD LIKE YOU NEEDED TO DO TO BE PUT IN STATUTE OUR INCLUDING AS I SAID THE RECESSION PLAN ACROSS MATCHING. ASSESSING THEIR FRAUD TOOLS REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE PUTTING THINGS ON THEIR WEBSITE- SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE ABILITY TO SEE- EDIE'S PROGRESS. IN CERTAIN AREAS AND THEN A DISTINCTION THAT WE MAKE IN OUR REPORTS NOW THAT WE WE'VE EVOLVED AS AN AGENCY- OUR THEIR SYSTEMS HAVE SOME SOME FOLKS WE HIRED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS- AS FAR AS PUTTING SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES. IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PAST WE WOULD MAKE. A CONGLOMERATE OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON A WHOLE LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS THE DEPARTMENT NEEDED TO DO BUT WHAT WE DIDN'T DO IS PRIORITIZE THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO IMMEDIATELY THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE EXPECT TO BE DONE BY MARCH. BY NAY BY JULY- AND WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE NOW. IN THE AUDIT REPORT LAID OUT FREE DD IN THE DOCUMENT THAT WE PROVIDED FOR THIS HEARING. BOB HAS THE FIRST PAGES THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THE NEXT TWO PAGES ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TDD AND WHAT WE DID IS WE PULLED US OUT OF THE AUDIT REPORTS SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO WILL NET D. WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TOOL THAT SAYS. HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE THE AUDITOR EXPECTS EDT TO DO IMMEDIATELY RELATE TO CLAIMS PROCESSING RELATED TO CALL CENTER RELATED TO FRAUD. AND HERE IT'S HERE THE OTHER MILESTONES HERE'S WHAT WE EXPECT THEM TO BE COMPLETE BY MARCH BY MADE BY JULY ETCETERA. SO IT'S A IT'S A GOOD ROAD MAP ON TO USE A MEMBERS TERM. FOR YOU AS MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE YOUR OVERSIGHT MY OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. TO MONITOR EDIE'S PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS AND HOPEFULLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA SAYS T. D. AND DECIDING WHAT ARE THEIR PRIORITIES WHEN THEY NEED TO DO IN THE IN IN THE SHORT TERM AND WHERE THE. TYPES OF THINGS THEY NEED TO DO IN THE LONG TERM. ALL RIGHT- LET'S THERE ARE. STILL A LOT OF MIKE SURPLUS CODY WERE SOMEBODY WOMAN A- KAMLAGER. KAMATA DOVE THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIR SALAS AND SHARE DALY FOR CONVENING THIS AND THANK YOU AUDITOR I JUST FOR THE RECORD WANNA SAY THAT SOME. I THINK A WEEK OR SO AGO- THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE HAD A- MEETING WITH C. D. C. R. N. T. D. ON THE FRONT COMING OUT OF THE PRISONS. AND THEIR REPORT STATED THAT IN FACT MANY OF THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WERE VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT SO I JUST WANT TO SORT OF PUT THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE I KNOW WE TEND TO MISS CHARACTERIZE THOSE FOLKS. THE REPORT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU'VE OFFERED FOCUS A LOT ON INDIVIDUALS I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ALSO SPEAK TO. ORGANIZATIONS SPECIFICALLY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALSO SEEM TO BE CAUGHT UP IN SOME OF THIS SO SPECIFICALLY- MANY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TEND TO SELF ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THEY PAY OUT THE CLAIMS. AND- THAT THEY- BELIEVED TO BE OBVIOUSLY LEGITIMATE- BUT THEN IN THIS INSTANCE MANY OF THEM ENDED UP BEING FRAUDULENT. AND SO IT'S NOT ONLY IS PUTTING A NUMBER OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE BOYS AND GLUBB BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AND SOME OTHERS IN FINANCIAL PERIL. BUT THEY'RE ALSO BEGINNING TO SEE A LOT OF THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS GO UP BECAUSE OF THOSE CLAIMS SO HAS YOUR OFFICE LOOK AT THIS POPULATION AND ARE THERE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE FOUR EDT REGARDING HOW TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. THAT MANY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW FACING AS A RESULT OF THE FRAUD. WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THEY THE AUDIT- THE EMERGENCY ON IT THAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE ASKED US TO DO IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT'S PERFORMANCE IN ASSISTING CALIFORNIANS IN ACCESSING. BENEFITS AND CERTAINLY- THEIR ABILITY TO PREVENT FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT SO WE DIDN'T LOOK AT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND- YOUR COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS IS ISN'T REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. ARE THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WE DON'T GET INTO THE DETAILS IN THE AUDIT REPORT ON THAT WERE VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT- WHO ARE INCARCERATED- SO THAT IS THAT IS AN IMPORTANT TO. A POINT THAT YOU MADE AS I SAID WE ARE OUR FOCUS REALLY WAS EDT NEEDING TO HAVE THAT CAPABILITY TO CROSS MATCH AGAINST INDIVIDUALS AND IN THE EVENT THEY DETERMINE THAT- AN INDIVIDUAL INCARCERATED HAS IS A VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL. AND THAT'S ANOTHER WORKLOAD ISSUE FOR EAT EAT EAT WHEN WE LOOKED- ACT HOW WELL EDT WAS DOING IN. REVIEWING COMPLAINTS THAT WERE COMING IN FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THEIR IDENTITY WAS STOLEN AND THEY WERE WAY BEHIND TYPICALLY THEY GET ABOUT SIX THOUSAND COMPLAINTS WE LOOKED AT TWENTY NINETEEN THEY GOT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND COMPLAINTS OF IDENTITY THEFT- AND HAD BEEN WORKING THROUGH THOSE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WHEN WE LOOKED ON DURING THE COURSE OF THE OUT AND THEY WERE OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND COMPLAINTS AND THEY HAD NOT REVIEWED VERY MANY OF THOSE AT THAT POINT IN TIME SO THERE ARE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE PARTICULARLY TIED TO YOU. ALTHOUGH THEY MATERIALS GOING OUT TO THE SUSPICIOUS ADDRESSES OR GOING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NO ONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD HAS FILED. FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE- AND THEY'RE SCARED THEY'RE AFRAID THEY MAY HAVE THEIR IDENTITY STOLEN- AND THEY'RE- SUBMITTING INFORMATION ET TO TRY TO GET THAT CLARIFIED WE ALSO POINT OUT AND REPORT THEIR MAYBE ON SOME INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T EVEN AWARE THAT THEIR IDENTITY HAS BEEN STOLEN THEY MAY GET SOME. INFORMATION FROM EDT SAYING HERE'S THE INCOME YOU RECEIVED UNEMPLOYMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU NEED TO REPORT THAT- TO OBVIOUSLY TO THE IRS- AND INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO BE SHOCKED BY THAT AND BE REACHING OUT TO EIGHTY SO I THINK THAT. IDENTITY THEFT AFFECTS A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA AND I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOUR POINT WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN THOSE CROSS MATCHES ARE LIKELY INDIVIDUALS WHOSE IDENTITY WAS USED- TO FOR SOMEONE TO FRAUDULENTLY GET PAYMENTS. BUT AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THIS IS EDT NEEDS TO DO THAT CROSSMATCH. AND HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO YOU KNOW. INVESTING THOSE PRETTY SHOULD. TO DETERMINE. WHICH ONES ARE FRAUDULENT- AND WHICH ONES THEY CAN. THEY CAN- YOU KNOW. MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTING. OUR RESULTING IDENTITY THEFT SITUATIONS FOR KALIFORNIA IS WHETHER OR NOT. ALL RIGHT TO MISTER GIBSON. YOU'RE UP TO BAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. GERMAN AND ALSO- CHAIRMAN DALY AND ALSO- FOLLIS- GREAT TO SEE HIM IS HOW WHEN I WAS A LECTURE SHE DID A HECK OF A JOB- WITH HER WORK AS A STATE AUDITOR SO I HAVE A QUESTION CLARIFYING QUESTION THIS IS REGARDING A WHAT I THOUGHT I HEARD WAS IT EDT THE ONE WHO DIRECTED BANK OF AMERICA TO PLACE THE WHOLE OR THE FREEZE ON THESE BANK ACCOUNTS OR WAS IT BANK OF AMERICA PUT THAT IN THE FREEZE ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE WAS SUSPICIOUS ACCOUNTS. THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION. THANK I'LL LET BOBBY ANSWERED BECAUSE IT'S LIKE I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION- MISTER GIBSON. THEIR WORK OR SOME SITUATIONS WHERE. THEY WAS COMMUNICATING TO EDT WE THINK THESE ARE SUSPICIOUS ACCOUNTS EDT NEED TO REVIEW THEM AND THEN DIRECT. BE A BAY TO FREEZE UP ACCOUNTS AND THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH. BOB CAN CAN DO A BETTER JOB THAN I EXPLAINING SOME OF THE DETAILS FOR YOU. SURE SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT. IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT ALL BANK ACCOUNTS THAT ARE. FROZEN OR HAD BEEN FROZEN THEN IT'S TRUE THAT SOME OF THOSE WERE FROZEN. BY BANK OF AMERICA ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE. AND OTHERS WERE FROZEN BY BANK OF AMERICA BUT AT EDT IS DIRECTION I THINK IS THE MOST SIMPLE WAY TO BREAK DOWN. THE TWO POSSIBILITIES THE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND THAT WE FOCUS ON. THAT BANK OF AMERICA FROZEN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS DONE AT EDIE'S DIRECTION. WE'RE TALKING THE REPORT ABOUT THE LONGER TIMELINE THAT LED UP TO THAT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WAS BANK OF AMERICA PROTEGER EDT WITH A LIST OF ACCOUNTS THAT THEY BELIEVE MIGHT BE. A FRAUDULENT THEY HAD PEAK FOR BANK OF AMERICA AS POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT ASKED EDT TO REVIEW THOSE. EDT COMPLETED THAT RUBIO AND THEN INSTRUCTED. BY BANK OF AMERICA TO FREEZE SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THOSE SO THERE WERE SOME THAT EDT DIDN'T ASK THANK AMERICA FREEZE. AND THEN ADDED ADDITIONAL ONES TO THEIR COMMUNICATIONS WITH BANK OF AMERICA THAT BANK OF AMERICA HAD NOT BROUGHT TO EAT IS ATTENTION THAT ALSO FREEZE FEES AND THEN IN TOTAL THAT AMOUNTED TO THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND. WE FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE IT WAS THE LARGEST AND MOST SUBSTANTIVE SET UP. BY FREEZING THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT CERTAINLY THERE BEEN OTHER SMALLER INSTANCES OF- FEWER NUMBERS OF ACCOUNTS FROZEN BY BANK OF AMERICA DEPENDENTLY OR IN COLLABORATION WITH EDT SO WITH THAT BEING SAID- IN MY TO UNDERSTAND THE BANK OF AMERICA- WHO FROZE AS WELL AS THE- DIRECTION BY ATV. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE INTEREST. WHO GETS THE ANSWERS. IS THAT INTEREST RETURNED BACK TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES THE PEOPLE OF THAT CALIFORNIA OR IS THAT INTERESTS. YOU KNOW JUST GONE. BECAUSE OF THE COUNSELING FROZEN. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER ASSEMBLY MEMBER OKAY MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE- TO STATE AUDITOR HAVE IN FACT THE EDT DEPARTMENT- IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT YOU RECOMMENDED HAVE THEY ALREADY IMPLEMENTED- TO DATE. TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANY OF THEM YET ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT BE AGREED WITH ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THEY INDICATED THAT THEY WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THEM- BUT BASS DAVE NOT MADE ANY SUBSTANTIVE PROGRESS TO HAVE FULLY IMPLEMENTED ANY OF THEM THAT'S DISHEARTENING TO ME BECAUSE OF WITH THE WITH ALL THIS **** IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH THE TV. TO PUT A BLANK. YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE YOU KNOW JOHNNY ON THE SPOT TAKING ALL THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION. TO SECURE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PRODUCT IS NOT GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND PEOPLE ARE NOT TO BE DISENFRANCHISED. AS A RESULT OF THEIR BLUNDER LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A STORY ABOUT A MAN NAMED MAY AND THEN A MAN NAMED. MISTER JOHN HE IS SLEEPING IN HIS CAR. HE HAS NO JOB PEOPLE ARE GOING BY GIVING HIM MONEY JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND YOU CAN'T GET RECALLS BECAUSE THE RETURN CALLS BACK HE'S NOT GETTING ANY RESPONSE OR ANY HELP. FROM THE ENTITY THAT SHOULD BE SUPPORTING HIM. AND I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY. ARE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT BEING HERE TO BASED ON THE STATE AUDITOR. ASKING REQUESTING THESE THESE- THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED THERE'S NO EXCUSE WE'RE IN A CRISIS AND I'M NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS YOU. BUT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM STATE AUDITOR WHO'S DONE A I'M SURE FOR A FORENSIC JOB CAME UP WITH HIS RECOMMENDATIONS AT A VERY PRUDENT MANNER. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD IN FACT BE IMPLEMENTED AT ONCE. WITHOUT HESITATION. FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PISSED OFF AND SO ARE WE- AND THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THEM NOT TO IMPLEMENT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THAT CALIFORNIA WHO IS MOST VULNERABLE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND IS USABLE IN BY MARCH. AGAIN IT'S NOT DIRECTED TOWARD YOU I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE NOT IMPLEMENT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S ALL. IN MISTER GIBSON ELEVEN OPPORTUNITY TO. DIRECT THAT- WELL PLACED QUESTION TO EDT. JUST THE DOWN THE ROAD A BIT LATER THIS MORNING- LET'S GO TO MISS PETRIE-NORRIS AND THEN MISTER COOPER. MISTER COOPER HONEST TEAM MEMBER OF THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE SO BY THE WAY THANK YOU ALL THIS IS A GREAT ATTENDANCE AND WE REALLY APPRECIATED. ALL AHEAD MISS PETRI NOTNG HERE TEAR DALY AND THANK YOU TO OUR SALAS AS IS OUR COLLEAGUE INDICATED THIS IS ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES IN THE RUN CRISES FACING STATE OF CALIFORNIANS SO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. I'M SO THANK YOU TO THE STATE AUDITOR FOR THIS- VERY THOROUGH IF SOMEONE WERE FINE I REPORT ON THE AT. THE NEAR OF FAILINGS AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT A COUPLE OF THAT SPECIFIC FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS SO- AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION AND- JUST THE HORROR ON BEHALF OF MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ON BEHALF OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE HAVE. LEGITIMATE CONSTITUENTS WITH LEGITIMATE CLAIMS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO. PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLES PAY THEIR RENT AND MAKE ENDS MEET YET. WE HEAR REPORTS OF FRAUD THAT EDT HAS SAID COULD ACTUALLY TOP NOT JUST TEN BILLION DOLLARS BUT YOU UP TO TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS- AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED THROUGH THE KIND OF KAFKA ESQUE. PROCESS OF IDENTITY VERIFICATION AT THE E. D. D. WITH HUNDREDS OF CONSTITUENTS I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. WHAT WAS IT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMS WERE PAID WHEN THEY COULDN'T VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF CLAIMANTS. TOTALING. SEVEN TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS DOLLARS. DO YOU SEE DID YOU EVER. THE POSSIBILITY THAT AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED I'M JUST I GUESS MY PERSPECTIVE WE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW SO MANY LEGITIMATE FOLKS. ARE STILL WAITING FOR BENEFITS AND IT SEEMS A REAL REAL EASY FOR FRAUDSTERS TO GET PAID. RIGHT SO WE MAKE NO RECOMMENDATION FOR IT AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION YOU SUGGESTED I WOULD POINT AGAIN TO THE VERY SLOW. WAY THE EDT REACTED TO THE INCREASED PROGRESS AT THE BEGINNING A PANDEMIC AND WE'RE NOT. POINT DIRECTLY TO- ACTIONS LIKE THE WAVE TO SAFEGUARD. THAT LET ONE BILLION OF THAT TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BE PAID OUT. N. ET DE DID NOT HAVE A CONFIRMED IDENTITY SO TO BE CLEAR THOSE PAYMENTS WERE MADE. AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN E. D. WAS NOT SURE. THE ONE BILLION REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT PAID TO THOSE. WHO DAY EVENTUALLY COULD NOT CONFIRM THE IDENTITY OF STUFF YES IT'S TROUBLING TO SEE THAT BUT WE THINK WE'VE INDICATED SOME PRETTY- MAJOR REASONS WHY BAD AMOUNT OF. BENEFIT PAYMENTS WAS ALLOWED TO BE MADE TO POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. PARENTS HAVE SIR JUST LAST HAVE OF COMMONSENSE DECISIONS BEING TAKEN RATHER TAN ANYTHING NEFARIOUS IN YOUR VIEW. WELL I THINK WITH RESPECT TO THAT THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR FIGURE AND FINDING THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT WE ATTRIBUTE THAT TO EDT NOT HAVING PREPARED IN ADVANCE TO UNDERSTAND ITS I. T. SYSTEM AGAIN IT WAS A MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT. I'VE INTENTIONAL SAFEGUARD WOULD STOP PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT AND THAT WAS JUST WRONG GOT IT STOP THIS PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT. I DON'T THINK THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SIR MISTER COOPER EUROPE. THANK YOU MICHELLE ONE THING BOTH THE CHAIRS OF THE VERY QUICK. AND FOR- MISS HOW HER STAFF YOU GOT ALWAYS DO A GREAT JOB. OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT IT WAS A DECADE AGO- ET THE GORE THE FEDERAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND IF IGNORE THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS- YOU'RE THE OVERSIGHT GIVES RECOMMENDATIONS BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT WORKING IT HASN'T WORKED. THIS IS NOT JUST WHAT ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURE IT'S MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS THAT GOES ON AND ON AND ON. THERE'S ALWAYS CONTINUE SO- OBVIOUSLY THE- CITY HAS OVERSIGHT BUT- HOW WE REALLY DEAL WITH THIS AND DRILL DOWN TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. YOU'RE RECOGNITION THAT BEEN IGNORED. THE LEGISLATURE IS BEING ORDERED TO APPOINT A WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN OCTOBER. WE HAVE THE- BEVERLY HILLS MAYOR THE POLICE SYSTEM POLICE CHIEF TALK ABOUT THEIR ISSUES THE MOST THOSE FOLKS- DOING EASY CARDS WERE FROM OUT OF STATE. SO HOW WE ONCE AND FOR ALL. PUT THIS TO BED JUST WITH PEOPLE AGENCIES THAT CAN. NO THE LEGISLATURE. IN GOVERNING. IT REALLY HAMMERED HOME. WELL THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION MR COOPER- I THINK ABSOLUTELY SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE TO A LEGISLATURE TO PUT SOMEOF THIS SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IN STATUTE- THE ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- FOUR EIGHTY TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE NOT JUST ON FRAUD BUT ON THE CROSS MATCHING- THERE IS ALSO AN ANNUAL REPORT YEAH EDT HAVE TO REPORT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HOW WELL IT'S DOING AS FAR AS GETTING THOSE INITIAL CLAIMS PAID WITHIN A FOURTEEN DAY OR TWENTY ONE DAY WINDOW- AND THAT'S SOMETHING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT EDT REPORTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT AS PART OF FEDERAL COMPLIANCE WORK THAT WE DO. BUT AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF STATES THAT STRUGGLE TO DO THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR EDT BUT I DO THINK SOME OF THE RECESSION PLANNING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THE STRIKE TEAM IDENTIFIED AS FAR AS WORKLOAD- ANALYSES AND AN EDT MAKING BETTER DECISIONS AS TO WHERE THEY CAN ASSIGN THEIR STAFF WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY THAT'S WHY WE TRIED TO PRIORITIZE THE RECOMMENDATIONS. YEAH BUT WE ALSO TRIED TO POINT OUT THAT NOT ONLY DOES EDT HAVE TO DEAL WITH PROCESSING CLAIMS AS THEY CONTINUE TO COME IN BUT THEY'VE PUT THEMSELVES IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION NOW BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIFFERENT THEIR CERTIFICATIONS AND US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR CAME DOWN AND SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT- SO THEY HAD TO RE ESTABLISH THOSE REQUIREMENTS BUT NOW THEY HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL BACKLOG. OF MILLIONS OF ISSUES AND MILLIONS OF CLAIMANTS THAT THEY NOW HAVE TO ADDRESS AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY HAVE AS I TALKED ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO THE- IDENTITY THEFT PROBLEM WHERE THEY HAD OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND COMPLAINTS R. AS A VICE IT WAS NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE SO EDT REALLY NEEDS TO COME UP WITH. AND THAT'S PART OF THE RECESSION LAND PART OF WHAT SHOULD DO A- AS- WATER ALL OF OUR WORK. IS YOU ARE ASSESSMENT AND LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT HOW ARE WE GOING TO ASSIGN STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THIS. IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE- OUR- CONCERN AS MISTER GIBSON AND MANY IF YOU I'M SURE ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS- THERE'S MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING- THAT NEED HELP- SO. I THINK THAT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE WILL ASSIST WITH THAT BUT I REALLY THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT IS JUST MONITORING WHAT DO YOU NEED EDT IS DOING. TO ASSESS BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT IN SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU NEEDING. YOU GOT IT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TWELVE MILLION ISSUES TIED TO TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. CLAIMANTS BOMB WHERE YOU PASS JUST THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. DO A RISK ASSESSMENT OF THOSE YOU KNOW BASED ON PAST HISTORY. WHICH OF THOSE TYPICALLY RESULT ARE ARE A FRAUDULENT CLAIM BEING SUBMITTED. SO DO THAT RISK ASSESSMENT SO THAT YOU'RE USING YOUR RESOURCES. TO THE BEST POSSIBLE YOU KNOW THE HIGHEST MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES SAME THING WITH THE CALL CENTER. WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED THE VIRTUAL CALL ABILITY TO HAVE THEIR THEIR CALL CENTER FOLKS BE ABLE TO WORK REMOTELY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THEY LOST SOME OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT THEY HAVE IN THE PHONE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BENEFIT FOLKS IMMEDIATE AND THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY WITH OUR PHONE SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT THOSE TOOLS. GET THOSE TOOLS IMPLEMENTED SO I THINK EATING NEEDS TO COME UP WITH- AND PERHAPS A DIRECTOR OF TALK ABOUT IT TODAY AND- AS FAR AS WHAT THEY'RE WORKING ON. FROM A STAFFING PERSPECTIVE A WORKLOAD PERSPECTIVE AND BEING ABLE TO DO THAT RISK ASSESSMENT PRIORITIZE. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW AND WHAT RESOURCES DO WE HAVE AVAILABLE. TO ADDRESS THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES BUT THEN ALSO JUST CONTINUING TO MONITOR AS AS BOB INDICATED. THIS ORDER IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN OUR TRADITIONAL AUDITS THAT WOULD PUT OUT NORMALLY IT'S A SIXTY DAY SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR. RESPONSE TIME FRAME WE DID DECIDED UNDER THE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY UNDER J. LACK BUT I ALSO IDENTIFIED THIS SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA IS A HIGH RISK SITUATION SO. WE PARK WE ARE COMBINED. A COUPLE OF AUDIT TEAMS UNDER MR HARRIS'S LEADERSHIP. WHERE WE WERE DOING WORK UNDER THE EMERGENCY REQUESTS FROM J. LACK AND THEN OUR HIGH RISK OF TORY THAT ALLOWED US TO DO THIS. MORE IN DEPTH COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND AUDIT. AND WHAT THAT MEANS WITH RESPECT TO EDT REPORTING TO US IT'S A IT'S A NINETY DAY WINDOW SO EVERY NINETY DAYS WE WILL BE GETTING. REAP REPORTS BACK FROM EATING. THE OTHER THING WE CAN DO IS WE CAN ASK FOR A- MORE FREE. THAN THAT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING YOU HAVE THIS DONE IN FEBRUARY YOU NEED TO HAVE THIS DONE IN MARCH SO WHEN WE HEAR BACK FROM MEETING WE CAN PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT WE TRULY NEED TO GET THIS DONE BY FEBRUARY THEY GOT IT DONE OR THEY DIDN'T GET IT DONE AND THIS IS WHY THEY DIDN'T GET IT DONE SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE. IS KEPT APPRISED OF. YOU KNOW EDIE'S PROGRESS NOT ONLY FROM E. D. THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH I TRUST THEY WILL CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE. BUT USING US AS YOUR INDEPENDENT SOURCE TO SAY EDT IS ASSERTING THEY'VE DONE THESE THINGS WE VERIFIED YEAH THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OR THEY'RE SUGGESTING THEY CAN'T AND THIS IS WHY. AND WE THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE EXPLANATION- SO. JUST TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE. ALL RIGHT SIR MR KILEY YOUR MIKE SIR PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISS HOW FOR THESE- REPORTS YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THAT THE HAND WRINGING IN THE VENTING- IN THIS LEGISLATURE ABOUT- THE EDT IS THAT THERE WERE SOME EXHAUSTION IS ACTOR WHO'S JUST SUDDENLY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE- AND BOARDED OUR WELL LAID PLANS WHEN IN FACT THIS IS AN ARM OF THE STATE- THAT'S IMPLEMENTING POLICIES- PASSWORD LEGISLATURE. ANDTHAT STAFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW- SO WHEN I SEE IN THE REPORT THEY DIDN'T DO THIS THEY DIDN'T AS THEY DON'T DO THIS OVER THE COURSE OF HOWEVER MANY YEARS- YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED WHY IS THAT I WANT TO ASK THAT IN A MORE SPECIFIC WAY. BECAUSE IF THE AGENCY IS CONSISTENTLY NOT BEEN FOLLOWING BEST PRACTICES IN THE WAY THAT A WELL RUN A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WOULD I ONLY SEE TWO POSSIBILITIES ONE IS THAT THE FOLKS IN MANAGEMENT ROLES- ARE NOT CAPABLE THEY'RE NOT COMPETENT THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE OR THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT MAYBE THERE ARE CAPABLE PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE LEGAL- BARRIERS SYSTEMIC BARRIERS- THAT PREVENT THEM FROM MANAGING THE ORGANIZATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH BEST PRACTICES SO BASED UPON YOUR STUDY OF THIS AGENCY- WHICH IS IT IS IT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE POOR PEOPLE POOR LEDERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AT THE AGENCY OR IS THERE SOMETHING THAT'S GETTING IN THEIR WAY. OF MANAGING THE AGENCY WHILE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY STATUTORY LIMITATIONS OR ANYTHING THAT PRECLUDES EDT FROM BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE NOW TEN YEARS AGO WHICH THEY WERE STARTING TO DO. BUT THEN THEY THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH. SO I THINK THAT LEADS US TO YOUR FIRST NOW- OPTION. IS MANAGEMENT AND I THINK. YOU KNOW MANAGEMENT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT AT THIS STATE AGENCY MY STUDENTS MY AGENCY ANY STATE AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW THAT IT'S THERE IT'S THE CLICHE TERM BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT STONE FROM THE TOP. MAKING SURE THAT- YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP IS LAYING OUT EXPECTATIONS. FOR EMPLOYEES IN THAT PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION- I THINK EDT LIKE A LOT OF LARGE AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S SUCH A HUGE BUREAUCRACY IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET THAT TONE FROM THE TOP. YOU KNOW PUSH DOWN THROUGH ALL OF THE SECTORS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION I THINK. EDT IS NOT ALONE IN THIS. NOW I'VE BEEN THE AUDITOR FOR A LONG TIME THERE ARE A LOT OF STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE JUST YOU KNOW ENTRENCHED IN THEIR TRADITIONAL PROCESSES. THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE DONE IT THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED TO CHANGE. I MEAN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT EIGHTY THE EMPEROR THIS YEAR. AUTOMATE USING ID ME THERE WAS A HUGE CHANGE AS FAR AS GOING FROM A MANUAL PROCESS TO VERIFY SOMEBODY'S IDENTITY WHERE. CLOSE 250% OF PEOPLE SUBMITTING A CLAIM. THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT MANUAL PROCESS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ID ME DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN PLACE THEY PUT ID BE IN PLACE IN OCTOBER. AND THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ABLE TO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY GET THAT CLAIM EXCEPT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PROCESS BEGIN. SO I THINK. THERE THERE CERTAINLY IS A NEED AT THE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS BUT ALSO TO BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW. MAKE IT CLEAR TO FOLKS AT THE LINE LEVEL WHO ARE DOING THE WORK ON A DAILY BASIS THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT TO DO WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT ARE THE ISSUES YOU'RE YOU'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST- DO WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ON SOME OF THE ISSUE RELATED TO TRAINING- AS BOB SAID YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT- EDT TEN YEARS AGO IT TOOK ON THIRTEEN FOURTEEN MONTHS TO TRAIN SOMEONE NOW THEY'RE SAYING WE STREAMLINED IT DOWN TO NINE. WELL I THINK THEY NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE THAN THAT. DO WE IS THERE A WAY WE CAN STREAMLINE THAT EVEN MORE OR DO AN ANALYSIS OF WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING. HAVE THREE RECORDED INFORMATION ON THEIR ON THEIR WEBSITE OR ON THEIR IN THEIR CALL SYSTEM HAVE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON THEIR WEBSITE- THEY RECEIVED A LOT OF INFORMATION ONLINE THAT THEY JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO RESPOND TO BECAUSE IT WELL WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THAT PERSON AGAIN. SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP- FROM THE DIRECTOR AND OTHERS. AND I KNOW THERE'S A- BRAND NEW TEAM OVER THERE. AND THEY ARE COMMITTED I WANT TO LET THE MEMBERS NOW I'VE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE DIRECTOR I'VE HAD CONVERSATION WITH THE AGENCY SECRETARY- AND SOME OF-THE OTHER. STAFF WERE HIRED INTO MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AT EDT AND I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THEY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE CRISIS THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN. BUT I THINK THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN AGENCY. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF EMBEDDED IN OLD BUREAUCRACY ALL PROCESSES AND WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE CREATIVE. AND APPROVING AS FAR AS USING AUTOMATION I'M DOING THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING A BETTER JOB AS FAR AS- STAFFING. WHAT ISSUES ARE WE ADDRESSING FIRST ARE WE GOING ABOUT PROVIDING STAFF. TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT- WE CERTAINLY IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT AND EDS IS WELL AWARE OF. SO IF OFTEN A POINT ABOUT HOW IT'S SORT OF THIS ENTRENCHED- YOU KNOW BUREAUCRACY THAT SET IN ITS WAYS SO YEAH LET'S SAY THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO BRING IN- TWENTY FIVE THIRTY LIKE TO PICK YOUR NUMBERS AND I. THE BEST MANAGERS IN THE PRIVATE. MOST CAPABLE WHO COMPLETE REPLACE. THE OPERATION ON OF MANAGEMENT. WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO YOU THINK GET THE TO RIGHT THE SHIP WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO DO IT OR WOULD THERE BE THINGS THAT STILL STOOD IN THEIR WAY. I'M I'M NOT AWARE OF THINGS THAT WOULD STAND IN THEIR WAY BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS EDT HUGE AGENCY- AND I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT CHEAP BUT IT BUT IT IS A HUGE AGENCY. AND THEN IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED BUT WITH ALL THAT SAID. THERE CLEARLY WERE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST RECESSION TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WHERE YOU KNOW THEY THEY WERE REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN YOU KNOW AFTER A YEAR GOES BY THEY KIND OF. BACK AWAY AND GET CAUGHT UP IN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND I THINK. SOME OF THE EXAMPLES WE HAVE IN THE AUDIT REPORT LIKE WHEN BOB SAID THAT YOU KNOW THEY THE AGENCY SECRETARY DIRECTED THEM TO. HELP BASICALLY SHUT OFF A SAFEGUARD WELL EDT SHOULD HAVE DONE ASSESSMENT SAID OKAY BUT IF WE DO THAT. HERE'S THE COST BENEFIT WE'RE GONNA GET PAYMENTS OUT MUCH MORE QUICKLY. BUT HERE'S THE RISK OF FRAUD. DO WE REALLY WANT TO DO THAT AND THERE COULD HAVE BEEN THE CONVERSATION. WELL YEAH LET'S DO THAT BUT LET'S MAKE SURE THESE OTHER FRAUD MANY. FRAUD TOOLS ARE GOING TO PREVENT PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT. AND IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN AND- TALKING WITH THE AUDIT TEAM ACTUALLY. SPEAKING WITH THE AGENCY SECTOR RECENTLY THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS WEREN'T HAPPENING- SO I THINK IF YOU BRING IN ARE THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BROUGHT IN SOME NEW FOLKS- THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE OVERNIGHT I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THEY CAN DO IMMEDIATELY- I THINK THEY- SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WE'LL DO OUR JOB AND HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE STEADFAST WITH THAT- AND I THINK THAT'S- THE BEST I CAN GIVE YOU AT THIS POINT MR KILEY. AGAIN I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION ALSO FOR THE DEPARTMENT- AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ANSWER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS MY FINAL COMMENT YOU KNOW- WE SEE THIS ISSUE AS YOU NOTED ACROSS DIFFERENT AGENCIES IS NOT JUST THE MEDIA THIS IS CERTAINLY BECOME THE POSTER CHILD FOR. AFTER GOVERNMENT FAILURE- AND SO IF THE PROBLEM REALLY IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE. IN MANAGEMENT ROLES THEN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW RAISES THE QUESTION. OF HOW DO WE IMPROVE THAT PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN ATTRACT THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST INTO THESE POSITIONS- OF SUCH POWER. AT THAT HAVE SO MUCH INFLUENCE OVER THE LIVES. OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS HERE WHICH ARE GREAT IS A GOOD RECOMMENDATION YOU PROVIDED BUT- EVEN SOME OF THE ONES TO THE LEGISLATURE IN SOME SENSE A BLUR THE LINE BETWEEN POLICY AND MANAGEMENT. AND I THINK THAT PERHAPS WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF WE LOOK AT THE OVER ARCHING POLICIES. THAT ARE DETERMINING. WHO WINDS UP LEADING THESE STAY AGENCIES AN WE FIX THE- SO THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. WHO HAVE GOOD MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE WILL BRING THE BEST PRACTICES OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE GOVERNMENT. THEN YOU KNOW WE WOULDN'T NEED TO KEEP HAVING AUDITS LIKE THIS WITH THE HORRIFYING FINDINGS THAT THEY MAKE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR KILEY- I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR STATE AUDITOR AND THEN WE'LL GO TO OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH INCLUDES AN EARLY BUT TO I'M SORRY I'M SO I DIDN'T SEE YOUR YOUR MY COAT SENATOR LEYVA GO AHEAD CHECK GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MADAM AUDITOR I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU YOURS TO SUCH A THOROUGH REPORT IN YOUR- YOUR IDEAS TO MOVE FORWARD ARE ALWAYS JUST COMPLETELY DIRECT AND VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND. MY QUESTION KIND OF GOES BACK TO THE LAST RECESSION WHEN YOU SAID THAT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AROSE THEN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY- EBV WAS ACTUALLY TRANSITIONING TO A BETTER- SYSTEM BUT THEY HAD TO STOP BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC SO THEY WERE FORCED TO USE THE ANTIQUATED SYSTEM I WAS JUST CURIOUS IF YOU KNEW IF THAT WAS TRUE. AND IF THERE BE ANY WAY THEY COULD GO BACK TO WORKING TO GET TO THAT. MORE STREAMLINED SYSTEM. OKAY IF. THANK YOU SIR IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT WHICH IS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THERE. SO EDT PUT THAT PROJECT ON PAUSE AT AFTER THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDED THAT THEY DO SO. AND REALLY OUR- RECOMMENDATIONS EDT FOR HOW TO MOVE FORWARD FROM HERE. I THINK WHERE YOU'RE QUESTIONS WAS HEADING IN THE STRIKING RECOMMENDATION THEY'RE VERY THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR IT'S JUST BREAKING CREDIT- EATING TO. TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT IS A LARGE IT PROJECT WASN'T SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS STILL. AND THEY NEED TO SEE WHAT CAN NAY. REMOVE FROM THAT LARGER PROJECT AND GET DONE IN A COMPONENT BASIS IN THE MORE SHORT TERM THAT WOULD BE PROVIDE THE MOST IMMEDIATE BENEFIT TO. CLAIMANTS AND TO EDIE'S ON STAFF SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THEY DO THAT ANALYSIS SO THAT THEY KNOW. HERE ARE THE PARTS OF THIS LARGER SCALE IT PROJECT THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE DONE FOR YEARS STILL. THERE WE CAN IMPLEMENT NOW THAT WOULD HAVE THE MOST DIRECT BENEFIT FROM THE MOST IMMEDIATE TERM TO CALIFORNIA. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AGAIN I APOLOGIZE SENATOR I DID SEE YOUR MIKE. AND I SEE A MIKE IN THE BACK THERE WITH THE MEMBER COOLEY GO AHEAD SIR. COLLEAGUES I JUST WANT TO JUMP AND I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS HEARING ELAINE VERY EXCELLENT JOB AS USUAL- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS THIS RAISES UP THE ISSUE OF OVERSIGHT AND AGGRESSIVE OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO RIDE THE WAVE OF OVERSIGHT IS A BODY INTO THE FUTURE. IN THE PAST WERE THE LEADING BODY OF OVERSIGHT IN THIS CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. TO THE MOST AUGUST SENATORS IN THE ROOM WITH ME- I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE WE FOCUS ON THE TVAND THE SPECIFIC THIS. I WANT TO URGE ALL TO TAKE A LOOK AT GOVERNMENT CODE. THIRTEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND THE FOLLOWING. THAT IS ACTUALLY THE STATE LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. AND THIS IS A BODY OF LAW THAT HAS ACTUALLY SEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE LAST. TEN YEARS. AND GOING BACK TO TWENTY ELEVEN WAS. A STRAIGHTENER THE STATUTE IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AUDITS AND FINANCIAL AUDITS. TO ADDRESS FRAUD. AND OF THE END OF THE PRIOR GOVERNOR THERE WAS MOVEMENT TO MODIFY THAT. I THINK YOU'RE FOR SOME FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENTAL ACCOUNTING. THAT WE WILL FIND IF WE GO BACK TO THE STATUTE AS EXISTED BACK. WHEN WE WERE SWORN IN REFER NOW THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWELVE. AND I THINK THIS OF. IT IS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE EVEN THE EDT IS IMPORTANT AS YOU DO THESE OPERATIONS ARE. LIKE HOW DO YOU RAISE THE BAR ACROSS ALL STATE AGENCY FOR A HIGH LEVEL OF ACTIVITY AND HOW TO WE IS LEGISLATURE FORTY SENATORS TO FORWARD. AND I WANT TO AGAIN CALL ATTENTION TO THAT ACT GOVERNMENT CODE THIRTEEN FOUR HUNDRED- OF THE LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY ACT I THINK IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THIS. AND I SPECIFICALLY WOULD. SAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE OF THE LAW AS IT EXISTED UPON THE- SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN OF SB. SIX ONE SEVEN- WHICH WAS A BI PARTISAN MOVEMENT THE SPEAKER AT THE TIME THE PRO TEM OF THE TIME FOR BALL THE DRAFTING OF THAT- I THINK WE'LL WANT TO LOOK AT THAT I NEED TO GET ON A RULES CONNECTED MATTER FOR POLTERGEIST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR COOLEY. I HAVE ONE QUESTION OF THE STATE AUDITOR BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR PANEL WITH. LABOR AND BUSINESS REPRESENTED- THERE'S A MENTION OF A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER PROVIDED DVD. MENTION IN THE CAN YOU AT LEAST GIVE US. A HINT OF WHAT TOPIC THAT INVOLVES THIS CONFIDENTIAL LETTER- THERE'S A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT. TIED TO- IDENTITY. I CAN'T GET INTO A LOT OF SPECIFICS THAT'S WHY WE SHARED THE INFORMATION WITH THE NEEDY IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER- JUST SO YOU KNOW MISTER DALY I DID SHARE THAT SAME LETTER WITH LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP. AS WELL AS THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE A COPY OF THAT LETTER EDT OF COURSE IN A AT AN AGENCY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE KNOWS THAT I SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE- BUT BEYOND THAT. MR DALY AYE I WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE DISCUSSING IN DETAIL ANYTHING IN THAT LETTER- BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT WE IDENTIFIED SOME THINGS THAT IF WE HAD PUT IT IN A PUBLIC DOCUMENT WOULD EXPOSE THE STATE TO POTENTIALLY- MORE FRAUDULENT SITUATION SO- INFORMATION IN THERE THAT IS IMPORTANT. FOR EDT TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY BUT I DID SHARE IT WITH. THEM LEADERSHIP- YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AS WELL AS THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- AND THEN WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S LABELLED CONFIDENTIAL ON THE OTHER HAND WE DON'T WANT TO BE. A BLIND SIDED- HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS- BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE DD- IT'S- THE WORD TRUST IS NOT TO NOT TO. PARAMOUNT MISTER SALAS TELLS ME HE HAS BEEN IN THE LOOP ON THIS- AS THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE SO THAT DATA IS VERY APPROPRIATE. AND- APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER MICELLE I THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH YOU'RE PROTESTING DALY. YEAH AND I DID COMMUNICATE WITH MISTER SALAS THAT THERE WAS THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS TYPE OF COMMUNICATION AND CLEARLY WE YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE WE WANT THE INTEGRATION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES BUT WE FELT NOW I WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE FEEL LIKE I'M A PARTNER WITH- THE LEGISLATURE SO- WE LIMITED I TALKED TO MY CHIEF COUNSEL AND NOW WE FELT THAT SHARING IT WITH LEADERSHIP WAS REALLY IMPORTANT- THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE- AND CERTAINLY- AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. IT'S THE DISCRETION OF THE THOSE INDIVIDUALS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT WE CAN'T THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WE SHARE THE LETTER WITH IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP CLEARLY VERY IMPORTANT AND THE COMMITTEE THAT I REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE- SO BUT- IMPORTANT. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO DEAL WITH. IMMEDIATELY. AGAIN THANK YOU N- YOUR HANDLING OF SENSITIVE ISSUES- AS USUAL IS A HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL AND I CERTAINLY RESPECT TO THE WAY YOU HANDLED THIS ENTIRE ABOVE AUDITS AND ANY OF THE CONFIDENTIAL ASPECTS THAT WERE ASPECTS YOU'VE CHOSEN TO MAKE CONFIDENTIAL I TOTALLY RESPECT AND UNDERSTAND YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. SO WITH THAT LET ME IT IT'S GONE TO THE THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU GOOD GOOD- OUR NEXT PANEL INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND- I HOPE THAT THE THOSE- TWO INDIVIDUALS ARE TEED UP AND READY TO GO MISTER EDUARDO MARTINEZ. THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FED- IS THE FIRST PARTICIPANT ON THAT NEXT PANEL ARE YOU WITH US MISTER MARTINEZ. YEAH YES SIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES BEAUTIFUL YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES FOR ALLOWING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY- MY NAME'S EDUARDO MARTINEZ SOME LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WE REPRESENT OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLION WORKERS IN OVER TWELVE HUNDRED AFFILIATED UNIONS. BUT GIVEN OUR CHARGE TO ADVOCATE FOR ALL WORKERS ORGANIZED AND NOT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY IN CONVERSATION ABOUT WAYS TO STRENGTHEN CRITICAL SOCIAL INSURANCE PROGRAM. TO BE CLEAR WE COME TO THIS CONVERSATION NOT SIMPLY TO FOCUS ON AN OVER BURDENED AND UNDER RESOURCE DEPARTMENT. WERE HOPING THIS NEWFOUND FOCUS ON UNEMLOYMENT INSURANCE CAN BE THE CATALYST FOR A LARGER SYSTEMIC CHANGE TO BETTER SERVE CALIFORNIA WORKERS. THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORTS LAID BARE WHAT MANY OF US ALREADY KNEW. WEAKNESS IN CLAIMS PROCESSING WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT AND INADEQUATE STAFFING AT CALL CENTERS. CONTRIBUTED TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS GOING WITHOUT BASIC EIGHT. ACCORDING TO LATEST JOB NUMBERS DESPITE RECENT POSITIVE JOB GROWTH NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS REMAIN OUT OF WORK COMPARED TO THIS TIME A YEAR AGO. AND UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT A POSSIBLE FRAUD PREVENTION SYSTEMS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE AUDITOR'S SECOND REPORT MANY LEGITIMATE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN FROZEN OR MADE INACCESSIBLE ONE BIT POTENTIALLY BILLIONS OF PROJECT PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD FOCUS ON ADDRESSING EDT WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. TO ENSURE THE DEPARTMENT IS PREPARED TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF FUTURE RECESSIONS. ALTHOUGH THIS RECESSION WAS MUCH MORE SAID IN AN UNPRECEDENTED SCOPE. AS THE AUDITOR FOUND TO REPORT THE ONSET OF THIS PANDEMIC WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME HE DDS FAILED ME TO SOUTH COAST CALL CENTER BENCHMARKS. THIS IS LIKELY TO PERSIST UNLESS MORE STRUCTURAL FORMS ARE MADE HOW EDS FUND. WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD IN THE EMPLOYMENT REYES LOW INDUCED NEEDED TO COMMUNITY RECEIVES LESS FUNDING FOR STAFFING RESULTIN IT BEING UNPREPARED WHEN A RECESSION. HITS AND WORKERS NEED ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM. WELL TYPICAL RESEARCH CAL OUT FIRST ADDRESS. TO MEET IN INCREASING CLAIMS. OBVIOUSLY COVER NINETEEN AND THEY BE COVERED NINETEEN INDUCED RECESSION PROVIDED NO SUCH LEAD TIME. BEYOND THE NEED TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS- WE BELIEVE THE EDT CAN MAKE BETTER USE OF ITS EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS TO HELP ADVOCATE APPLICANTS NAVIGATE AND ACCESS THE SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PARTNERS WITH EDT TO PROVIDE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TO WORKERS ORGANIZE AND NOT. WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM WORK. THROUGH THE USE OF VIRTUAL WEBINARS AND ACCESS TO EDT STAFF WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR STAFF HAS BEEN ABLE TO DIRECTLY ASSIST OVER THREE THOUSAND WORKERS YOUR ACCESS YOU AYE BENEFITS OR OTHER TOP RESOURCE. AND I COULD JUST TAKE A QUICK MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF THE STAFF DOING THIS CRITICAL WORK UP PARTICULARLY AGREE LEGISLATIVE STAFF. I'M SURE YOUR STAFF TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW DIFFICULT THIS WORK IS A GIVEN THE VOLUME OF CONTACTS AND THE FREQUENT INABILITY. FOR STAFF OUTSIDE OF THE TV. EDT TO RESOLVE CASES. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO MODERNIZE OUR YOU I SYSTEM WE WOULD ASK THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE TO CREATE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEES TO OVERSEE THE NEW SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION. I WAS OTHER STATES HAVE MODERNIZE THEIR SYSTEMS THESE COMMITTEES HAVE HELPED IDENTIFY ISSUES REACHING HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES. AND FINALLY AS YOU CONSIDER POLICY CHANGES WE WOULD STRONGLY URGE MEMBERS TO CONSULT WITH THE PDP WORKFORCE AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THESE DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS WILL BE KEEN IDENTIFYING EFFICIENCIES AND IMPLEMENTED NEEDED SOLUTION. NOW OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES. HOWEVER FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW THESE PROBLEMS COULD BE RESOLVED AND YET THE U. I. SYSTEM WOULD STILL BE PLAGUED BY TWO EVEN MORE SERIOUS CONDITIONS. GROSS BENEFIT INADEQUACY AND PERSISTENT AND COSTLY PERIOD OF YOU I FIND INSULTS. JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND CALIFORNIA'S YOU I SYSTEM HAS BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHERE THIS- SYSTEMS FUNDING OUR SYSTEM WAS CHANGED UNDER WHICH IN GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES THE U. I FIND ACCUMULATED RESEARCH TO SEE IT THROUGH TO- SESSION. TO ADD UP TO A PAY AS YOU GO SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE OUR SPACE YOU I FIND HAS NEEDED TO BORROW FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO BE SURE THESE LOANS ARE PAID BACK OVER THE YEARS BY EMPLOYERS FOR GOING THEIR NORMAL FEDERAL TAX CREDITS BUT THE INTEREST ON THESE LOANS AMOUNTING TO OVER ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FROM THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION ALONE. COME FROM CAL TACK. BE A THE GENERAL FUND. THE ADOPTION OF THIS PAGE YOU GO TO THE SYSTEM AND THE FAILURE OF ANY FUNDING FIXES TO BE ENACTED HAS LED US TO THE POINT WHERE THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. THANK CALIFORNIA'S YOU I FIND DEAD LAST AMONG ALL STATES. MEANWHILE CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST WAGE REPLACEMENT RATES IN THE COUNTRY AVERAGING ABOUT 26% OF THE WORKERS CURRENT. TWENTY SEVEN STATES INCLUDING OUR NEIGHBORS IN NEVADA OREGON AND WASHINGTON PAY HIGHER MAXIMUM WEEKLY BENEFIT. TWENTY EIGHT STATES PAY HIGHER MINIMUM WEEKLY BENEFITS. TWENTY NINE STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA VIRGIN ISLANDS PUERTO RICO PAY HIGHER AVERAGE WEEKLY BENEFITS. UNLIKE CALIFORNIA THIRTEEN STATES PROVIDE PROVIDE DEPENDENT ALLOWANCE. ALMOST HALF THE STATE'S INDEX THEIR BENEFITS TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. HOWEVER WE DO NOT. JUST OPPOSE OUR STATE YOU AYE SYSTEM TO THAT OF ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS ND WE CAN SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE. JUST LAST WEEK DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC WASHINGTON STATE PASSED LEGISLATION THAT NOT ONLY REDUCES TAXES ON EMPLOYERS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY INCREASES- INCREASES THE MINIMUM BENEFIT AWARDS AND EXPAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EMPLOYERS CAN ACCESS YOUR BENEFITS. WELL WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE FOCUS TODAY ON THE MEDIA ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE STATE AUDITS WE HOPE THE LEGISLATURE WILL LOOK AT THE SYSTEM HOLISTICALLY. THE REALITY IS OUR STATE YOUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN FALLING SHORT FOR WORKERS FOR DECADES AND MUCH MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO STRENGTHEN THIS CRITICAL SOCIAL INSURANCE PROGRAM I CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER JACK. THANK YOU MISTER MARTINEZ. AND- LET'S GO NOW TO IN IN MISTER MARTINEZ IF YOU COULD- IT'LL LINGER A BIT AND CAISTOR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. BUT NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MR ROBERT MOULTRIE OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS A POLICY ADVOCATE THERE. PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR- GOOD MORNING EVERYONE HERE THANK YOU WE CALL THIS NUMBER FOR A LONG OVER HEARING ON WILL- AND NEED ALL OF THE- LET ME NEXT QUARTER OUR NOT. WITH WHAT ONLY ONE TO THEM IF WE OUR DO THAT IT'S THE KIND OF WORKERS EXPLAINED NEXT- SO WHAT SURPRISED. SOMEONE WHO KNEW- MARC LEVINE ABOUT FIVE FUNDING RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE FALL- AND I WRITE ON THE BRICK WALL AND PEOPLE LAUGH WORKING. FOR SO THE FIRST THAT IN BONTA ARE- YES NOTED- YOU ARE ALREADY SPONSORED BY YOUR IN QUESTION ON WHAT OKAY HOW MUCH OF PROJECT THE NEW LAW- THE STATE'S LAW ON THE FEDERAL. E. RATE MONIQUE LIMON HOUSEHOLD. ON SUNDAY. THERE WE PULL SO CAN ONLY HE SAID THAT HE SOMEWHERE AROUND ON WATER OR WILL BE WHAT MORE CENTER. ALL THE STATE LAW- THIS CLEARLY. IT MAY BE YOUR MIKE- THE TECHNICIANS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY CHAMBER. SAY WE HAVE THE VOLUME TURNED UP TO THE MAXIMUM. IF YOU COULD MAYBE GET CLOSER TO YOUR MIND OR ADJUSTED SOMEHOW- YES LET ME TRY TO SPEAK MORE AND MORE ALLOW GOOD THAT'S IT'S ALREADY BETTER THANK YOU OKAY APOLOGIES I- I GET EXCITED. SO THESE SMALL DOWN AND TRY TO MAKE- SO SPEAKING ABOUT ARE THE SOURCE OF THE PROJECT WE'RE KIND OF WE'RE THE PRODUCT MAKING MODEL BOB I HAVE FOUND CALIFORNIANS. OR UP FROM THE FEDERAL BENEFITS HI IF YOU'RE AROUND FIVE PERCENT. EIGHTY MIGHT FIVE FORTY FIVE THEIR PASSCODES LAST MONDAY MEMBERS AND ALTHOUGH WHAT. IS A MEDICARE- THE QUESTION 85% 5% WHAT NUMBER. BROADLY SPEAKING ON HAPPY JUST TEN BILLION WHILE ESTIMATE WHICH I FOR TO THE MORE MINUTES NOT HAVE ONE SEVEN. NOT AND THEN WE ARE REPORT NUMBER IS LIKELY LAW. RECENT ALSO NOTES THAT THE UMBER A LOT OF I DIDN'T MEET MUCH THE- SEVENTY. OF PREVENT WITH THE THEIR ALL BROUGHT. THAT MEANS THAT ARE NUMBER. SOME BETWEEN. AND. IT'S STILL A LITTLE MUDDLED- SO. TRY TO ADJUST IT ONE MORE TIME. YEAH YOU JUST ONE MOMENT. AND IF NOT I MAY CALL IN. WHAT WAS. CALLING. YOU SEE YOU MAY CALL IN OR YOU WILL CALL. IS CALLING IN NOW OKAY. A CONSIDERING ALL THE LOGISTICS- THESE HEARINGS ACTUALLY GO QUITE WELL. I KNOW OUR STAFF DOES ITS- DOES THEIR BEST. HOW ABOUT NOW OKAY. YES IT'S BETTER. OKAY I'M FOR ALL THE TROUBLE EVERYONE'S- WE WILL NOW TRY TO MOVE QUICKLY AND CLEARLY- GIVEN THAT I'M ALREADY A LITTLE OVER TIME- SO BANKING OF COURSE THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUDITOR FOR YOUR WORK I'M I'D LIKE TO START OUT WITH- KIND OF FOCUSING ON A P. THAT WASN'T COVERED- AT IN OUR COMMON PREVIOUSLY WHICH RELATE TO WHAT THE FRAUD MEANS TO THE HEALTH OF THE FUN AND KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS PAY FOR THE HEALTH OF THE FUNDS AND SO THAT YOU CAN WILL START WITH- AND I'LL BE READING THAT THE MAP HERE ON THE DATA FROM THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AS WELL AS DATA RELEASED BY EDT LAST MONDAY IN THEIR PRESS RELEASE THAT IS A MORE UP TO DATE NUMBER- SO PUTTING IT NUMBERS TOGETHER- THE AUDITOR AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ABOUT 5% OF THE KNOWN FRAUD- IS. THE TRIVIA OF. THE DAY YOU Y. CON- AND HAD TAKEN THEIR- THE FOR- BIGNOT THERE'S LESS MORE BROAD IT NOT YET BEEN FULLY IDENTIFY- JIM FACT. IF YOU NEED TO A TELLER COMMON EARLIER IF IT. WILL WE WOULD CALL. FRAUD WHERE IT'D BEEN DEATH BROUGHT BUT OF COURSE IT HAD ALL BEEN TRACKED DOWN YET- ET FLAG LAST MONTH THAT A- 70% OF THEIR BENEFIT- DISTRIBUTED WHICH- MAY ALSO BE A PROBLEM. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FRAUD WOULD BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND THIRTY BILLION DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT ADDITIONAL 17% OF BENEFITS- I TUNING THAT 5% OF THOSE ARE ATTRIBUTABLE THANK YOU I FIND THAT MEAN FOR LOOKING AT- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND ONE POINT FIVE. BILLION IN FRAUD APPLICABLE TO THE STATE YOU Y. FUND. WHICH THAT EMPLOYERS WILL BE- PAYING BACK OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS- DEPENDING ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET OUT. SO THAT'LL BE THAT'LL BE THE EXTENT THE MATH SO. APOLOGIES FOR LEADING UP WITH THAT BUT THAT NEEDED TO THE NEXT QUESTION. WHAT HAPPENED IN TERMS OF RECOVERING THAT- I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT HERE- A NOTE FROM THE AUTHORS- JANUARY TWENTY SIXTH REPORT. WHICH WAS THAT THIS PRODUCT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO RECOVER FROM. THANK YOU NEED TO RECOVER FROM THE CLAIM- TRUE FRAUDSTERS RIGHT UTILIZED OTHER IDENTITY WILL BE DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN. AND EVEN IF THE PROJECT CAN BE TRACKED DOWN THEY LIKELY WILL BE HOLDING THE FUNDS- YOU KNOW OF COURSE WE APPRECIATED THE PROPERTY TOIL EFFORTS TO KIND OF PURSUE THEM. BUT AT THE AUDITOR'S REPORT NO THE SCALE OF THE AFTER. THE FALL- ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER THAN THE PRODUCT WE'RE TALKING BOUT- I BELIEVE PREDICATED. FILED A SEARCH ABOUT THIRTY MILLION. IN BROAD SO AT TO BE RECOUP THAT THIRTY MILLION VERSUS. YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO A BILLION OR MORE- SO GIVEN THAT THOSE RECOVERY EFFORTS ARE VERY LIMITED RIGHT THE NEXT QUESTION HAD BECOME. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT- THE AUDITOR'S REPORT DEALS WITH THIS WLL AND BLACK THIS YOU THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WITH WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. OBVIOUSLY CAN HAVE TAX IMPLICATIONS IF YOU'RE RECEIVING BENEFITS BE RADICALLY. BUT NOT ACTUALLY RECEIVED THEM YOU MAKE IT TAX FROM OR YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO CLAIM THE FUTURE. AND OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THOSE CASES ARE ON ACCEPTED- AND THE POINT THAT I'M HERE IF. THE THING APPLY TO HELP EMPLOYERS IT'S- WHICH IS TAKEN FROM THE FUND. WILL HAVE ONGOING TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS AS WELL FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. AND OBVIOUSLY AT JEFF AS INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS. WHO THAT GUARANTEES WERE STOLEN HAD NO CONTROL AND SHOULD BEAR NO PUNISHMENT FOR THAT. I'M CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS ALSO HAVE NO CONTROL AND WE WOULD DAY SHOULD. BEAR NO PUNISHMENT. BROUGHT I. LOOKING FOR I LIKE TO A HIGHER AND THE AUTHOR FOR NUMBER DIRECTLY FOR TO THAT RIGHT- RECOGNITION RECOMMENDATIONS BY AND IN THE JANUARY TENTY EIGHT REPORT. THAT WAS IT CENTER TRACKING- TOOLS TO REVIEW BROUGHT AND PURSUING ONGOING AND NOW WHICH TOOLS ARE AFFECTED- AND REPORT OUT THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS CAN BE AWARE OF THAT AND EXERCISE OVERSIGHT WE SUPPORT ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS- AND BELIEVE THEY'RE NECESSARY- YOU KNOW LOOKING BACKWARD HOW DO WE WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE THAT RECOVERY RATE SOME PLAYERS ARE LEFT OUT OF HERE RIGHT- ONE POINT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE MONEY RIGHT MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- YOU KNOW MONEY TO REPLENISH THE FUND WOULD HELP. TO MAKE THIS FRAUD NOT HIT THE COMMUNITY AT MUCH AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE BETTER LEGISLATION ADDRESSING HIM- BUT ONE ELEMENT OF POTENTIALLY IMPROVING RECOVERY- THE AUDIT REPORT NOTE THAT THERE IS A LIMITED TIME LINE FOR E. D. TO- TO SEEK TO RECOVER- FRAUDULENT PAYMENT- AND GO TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION THANK YOU THE FRAUDULENT CLAIM IS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN CORRECT. YOU KNOW WE WOULD REQUEST THE DATE IN THE CAN BE DONE TO EIGHT THOSE RECOVERY EFFORTS- SHOULD BE DONE AND IT MAY TAKE THE FORM OF EXTENDING THE TIMELINE FOR EDT TO PROP THAT REDEVELOPMENT YOU IDENTIFY THAT AND YOU RECOVER THAT ANY EFFORTS THAT AFFECTS WOULD BE HELPFUL FONG FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FREE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE GOING TO END UP IN A BATTLE HERE- WITH. THE RESPONSIBILITY- FELL OFF UP THERE APOLOGY THE TECH. ISSUE AND HOPEFUL- THEY WITH AUDIBLE WILL BACK OUT OF PHONE. TO YOU MISTER MO. AND- YEAH AFTER YOU FIX- AFTER THE FIXING YOUR PHONE CALL IT WAS MUCH MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND.

OF COMING AND STATE AGENCIES AND HELP FIX PROBLEMS- PREVIEW CHU TESTIFYING LAST WEEK AS WELL- AND BUDGET SUB FOR. AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID THIS WEEK. IN TODAY'S HEARING NOT ONLY. BEING ACCEPTING OF THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT TRYING TO REFORM. THE EDT AND MAKING SURE THAT CLAIMANTS GET PAID. WITH THAT BEING SAID IN AND YOUR FOLLOW UP TO THE SENATORS QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF. LOOKING TO ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE IN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THESE REFORMS ARE A NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS THAT HAVE INTRODUCED MYSELF INCLUDED AMONG THEM- PROPOSALS TO ACTUALLY HELP OR FOR ME TO DO SO THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. MAKE SURE THAT THE FRUSTRATION THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE FEELING. THROUGHOUT THE STATE I GET ADDRESSED AND GET ADDRESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE AUDITOR AND THE FIRST PANEL WHERE SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT. HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR OVER A DECADE- SO WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO ASK- THE SIGNS IN YOUR TEAM. ABOUT THE WORKLOAD AND WHETHER YOU DD IS PREPARED. TO MOVE FORWARD YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CALL CENTER AND HIRING AND I BELIEVE YOU SAID NINETY THREE MORE STAFF THIS MONTH- BUT- WHEN I LOOKED AT THE AUDIENCE YOU KNOW WE FOUND THAT THE EDT IS. FACING AN IMPENDING WORKLOAD- STEMMING FROM TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION ELIGIBILITY ISSUES- THIS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCE OF UPWARDS OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMANTS- WHEN THE OTHER LOOKED AT IT SHE SAID- IT HER REPORTED INDICATED THAT WOULD. NECESSITATE NEARLY THREE MILLION HOURS TO SORT THROUGH THESE ELIGIBILITY ISSUES SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE DUTIES PLAN AND TIMEFRAME FOR TACKLING. THIS IMPENDING WORKLOAD. WELL WE ARE HIRING I HUNDRED ADDITIONAL STAFF THIS MONTH. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME WHEN I CAME INTO THE DEPARTMENT IS THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT REQUIRES THE- MANUAL INTERACTION. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT- ALSO ARE SOMETHING THAT MISTER MARTINEZ MENTIONED- IN HIS TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW THE- NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN EDT STRUCTURALISTS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS THAT YOU CANNOT- YOU COULD NOT EXPECT INNOVATION AND MODERNIZATION YOUR STAFF COMES AND GOES BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS. PEOPLE ARE. THEY'RE LEARNING THE JOB THEY'RE DOING THE JOB THEY DON'T HAVE THE BANDWIDTH TO ENGAGE IN MODERNIZATION. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. UP IN THE- SO FAR. IT'S TOP OF MIND. IN GENERAL PROVIDES. GRANTED EXPERIENCE OF LOOKING AT THESE TYPES OF THINGS BEFORE. WE WILL BE DOING. KIND OF SERVICE AND THEN THAT JUST BEGS THE QUESTION OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR OVER A DECADE OF WHY DON'T WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IN PLACE. NOW IDT. THAT'S A TERRIFIC QUESTION AND I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE ON WHY THINGS DIDN'T. GET DONE NAKATANI. ET OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS BECAUSE I WASN'T. BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU AND THOSE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHOEVER MY WORKING HARSH NEGATIVE. SIX GOT IT SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT. TRYING TO MODERNIZE AND REFORM THE SYSTEM. HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE MOVING TO ANAUTOMATIC THE SYSTEM OF AUTOMATION VERSES OF MANUAL INPUT WHAT YOU'RE INDICATING TO US IS WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG FOR A LOT OF THESE CLAIMANTS IN THE FRUSTRATIONS WERE HERE FOR CALIFORNIANS. FOR IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH- PAPER PROCESSES AND MORE POPULATION OF STAFF. AND LEARN ABOUT THEIR HISTORY EDT DURING TWENTY TWENTY. I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE MODERNIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CALGARY COUNTY AND MY BEST PROJECT IN MY WORK WITH XEROX I KNOW THE TYPE OF APPROACHES THAT HAVE TO BE MEET. THE NEEDS OF. LOOK AT THE REVISION OF BUSINESS PROCESSES. HE ARE. SOLICITATION OF RAMBLE OF VENDORS WHO COULD DO LARGE SCALE WHAT THEY CALL THE CHIEFS AND- I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT EDT HAS CONSIDERED BEFORE I THINK THAT THE THEY WERE ON THE VERGE OF LOOKING AT SOME SORT OF A CARD HE HE FOR THE PANDEMIC CAN'T AND THEN EVERYTHING TURNED TO GETTING POSTCARDS RIGHT. OUR I BELIEVE THROUGH THE PROGRESS IN DOING SUCH A CHANGE AND THE PITFALLS OF DOING SUCH A CHANGE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S NOT AN EASY LET I PROMISE YOU AND THERE WILL BE MISTAKES. BUT SUCH A THING GETS UNDERWAY. WE CAN BE DONE. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PLAN YOU HAVE MOVING FORWARD YOU KNOW GIVEN YOUR HISTORY AND I APPRECIATE- YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THIS DEPARTMENT BUT- WHAT'S THE PLAN MOVING FORWARD TO HELP ADDRESS. A LOT OF THESE ISSUES I THINK THE LEGISLATURE I THINK CALIFORNIANS WILL JUST FILL A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE KNOWING. THAT THERE'S A PLAN IN PLACE AS OPPOSED TO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. YOU KNOW JUST TALKING ABOUT EVEN THE CALL CENTERS AND YOU TALK ABOUT HIRING MORE INDIVIDUALS. YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU DOING BEST PRACTICES- BECAUSE THE AUDITOR IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES THERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU KNOW Q. NA JUST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS IS THERE A CHAT THAT PEOPLE COULD CHAT WITH PEOPLE ONLINE TO RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES. BECAUSE WE LOOK AT THE ON RECORD IN. AND THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN GENETICALLY TO TV THAT. OPERAND THE M. INDIVIDUALS AND SEEING THE NEEDLE BARELY MOVING- DOESN'T INSTILL A LOT OF CONFIDENCE AND SO. HAVING A PLAN WILL HELP INSTILL THAT CONFIDENCE IF YOU COULD JUST EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A- A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN WHICH IS PART OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH YOU SAID YOU WOULD IMPLEMENT- THAT WOULD HELP US TREMENDOUSLY. YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE STRIKING REPORT THAT WAS. NEUSTIFT SEPTEMBER. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GOING FORWARD- SOLUTIONS AND TIME LINES AND THAT. THE AUDIT REPORT HAS PROVIDED A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS AND TIMER I AM GOING TO USE THAT AS A BILL CREDIT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- NINETEEN. REVISI RESTRUCTURING WHAT IT IS WE DO SO THERE IS A PLAN. THIS IS NOT A LOT OF STICKING AROUND- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO HAPPEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. WITH THIS BOOK. WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT YOU SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE ALREADY IN THE AREA FRAUD. WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY FINISH THEIR- WACKSTAR. MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MIND- ENDED SECATEURS TEAMS VIEW IS CUSTOMER SERVICE WE HAVE GOT TO HANDLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I INITIATED A CRITICAL ISSUES FOR. OUR CALL CENTER. SO I'M NOT BIG ON A LOT OF PLANTS I'M GETTING ACTION. AND AS I SAID WE HAVE THE BLUEPRINTS NOW WITHIN A- DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO ACCELERATE TEXAS. I APPRECIATE THAT MOVING-FORWARD- SO CAN YOU JUST TELL US FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THEN. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS TO GET THEIR BENEFITS AND HOW ARE YOU GOING ABOUT TO. DECREASE THAT TIME LINE SO IT GETS TO PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. HOW I'M VERY HIGH ON TRANSPARENCY BUT I THINK TRANSPARENCY IS USELESS WITHOUT ACCURACY SO I'M GOING TO ASK ONE OF MY CHIEF DEPUTIES TO STEP IN AND- PATTERSON THAT THAT QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL. THANK YOU. CAROL WILLIAMS HELLO- THANK YOU. FOR RECEIVING US TODAY AND ALLOW THIS TO RESPOND TO THE ON EDGE THE REASON WHY IT HAS TAKEN SO LONG TO PAY CLAIMS IS- COMPLETELY MANUAL PROCESS. PRIOR TO ME COMING IN OCTOBER FIRST WHEN A CLAIMANT WHEN. WHENEVER INDICATIONS ON A CLAIM THAT A CLAIM NEED TO BE REVIEWED IT WAS A COMPLETELY MANUAL PROCESS AND THAT LED TO WHAT EVERYONE'S FAMILIAR WITH WAS THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION BACKLOG CLAIMS AT THE POINT OF- SEPTEMBER NINETEENTH. AND THOSECLAIMS WHEN ALL THE WAY BACK TO APRIL TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S WHY IT THROUGH THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAT WAS THE PRIORITY FOR THE ORGANIZATION TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE CLAIMS GIVE FOLKS PAID OR GIVE THEM THEIR STATUS IT WAS AN UNPAID STATUS. THE AUTOMATION IS REALLY THE BIG LEFT IN THE BIG OPPORTUNITY HERE EDT FOR ALL OF OUR PROCESSES- AND I APPRECIATE THE POINT MADE EARLIER TODAY BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND GET READY TO RESUME- PLANNING IN OUR PROCESS FOR BUSINESS. FOR OUR- OUR MODERNIZATION OF OUR SYSTEMS WE CAN'T WAIT THREE YEARS CLAIMANTS CAN'T WAIT YOU CAN'T WAIT THE PUBLIC CAN'T WAIT WE NEED TO TAKE IT IN SMALL CHUNKS TO PROVIDE THE AUTOMATION TO BEAT FASTER FASTER THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN. SO THE AUTOMATION. OF CLAIM FILINGS A SIGNIFICANT. PRIOR TO ME COMING IN ALL CLAIMS. THERE'S A SIXTY PER AUTOMATION. ON 40% FELL OUT FOR MANUAL MANUAL PROCESS AND TODAY WE'RE AT 8990% MAN ALSO. CLAIM FILINGS- WHEN THEY'RE CLEAN OUR ARMED STREAM WE FAST. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WORK AS WE ARE AS BEEN MENTIONED TODAY WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK FROM THE PAST THAT WE NOW NEED TO ADDRESS AND JUST TO ADDRESS THE DETERMINATIONS THAT WERE SUSPENDED PRIOR. LAST SPRING WE HAVE A TASK FORCE RIGHT NOW THAT IS LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MOVE THROUGH IT AS SWIFTLY AS WE CAN BUT STE WE HAVE TO FREE UP STAFF. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE AUTOMATION SO STAFF CAN DO THE HARD MANUAL WORK THAT TRULY IS REQUIRED IN THAT TRULY HAS BEEN WAITING FOR APPEAR TO TIME AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND STOP THERE BUT THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT AND THE AUTOMATION SO ON AVERAGE NOW WITH THE REFORMS THAT YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTED WHAT'S THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME FOR APPOINTMENTS. THIRTY WILL GUIDELINES WE ARE IN A FOURTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. DAY WINDOW TO MAKE THE FIRST PAYMENT. AND AS OF MIND OR STATS AS OF THE END OF DECEMBER I BELIEVE WE WERE AT SIXTY PER. AREA AS OF TWELVE THIRTY ONE WE WERE MAKING FIRST PAYMENTS AT A RATE OF. 76% OF THE TIME AND THAT WAS AT THE TWENTY ONE DAY MARK AND THAT IS UP FROM JUST THIRTY ONE WE WERE MAKING THE FIRST PAYMENT ON TIME SO WE NEED TO GET EIGHTY SEVEN AND HIGHER. THAT IS THE FEDERAL MANDATE THAT IS THE MARK BUT IT IS ENCOURAGING TO SEE THAT WE'RE LEAST GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OKAY. GOT IT REMAIN PRECIADO BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY- LIKE CHAIRMAN DALY SAID WE ARE HEARING FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE UPSET AND I. I'M HOPING THERE- MAYBE IN THAT OTHER. 12% THAT NEEDS TO GET THEIR ISSUES ADDRESSED UP. BUT WITH THAT I WANTED TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION ON ON THE FRIDAY MAY. AND CAN YOU TELL US AT THIS POINT HOW MUCH OF THAT FRAUD BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN REPORTS ANYWHERE FROM A MINIMUM OF TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS- TO ANYWHERE NEARLY UP TO THIRTY ONE BILLION I THINK I THOUGHT I SAW ONE NUMBER. BUT HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE U. Y. PROGRAM AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PO I PRO P. YOU A PROGRAM. SO WHAT STATE DOLLARS AND WHAT'S FEDERAL DOLLARS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT NEEDS THE VARIOUS WITH EDT- OF THE- ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION OR SO THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN IN FRAUD TO THE TEN PERCENT- 95% OF THAT IS IF YOU A AND THE REMAINING FIVE PERCENT. AS I THINK- MR MOULTRIE- POINTED OUT IS THE U. Y. SYSTEM. M. I'M SORRY HELP ME WITH THE MATH WHAT DOESN'T WORK OUT TO- IT'S ABOUT ITS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OR SO FOR THE U. I. AND THEN THE REST IS UP TO YOU WAY. ELEVEN BILLION MINUS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. YEAH TO ISIS. CORRECT. GOT IT AND SO I JUST WANT TO GO BACK AND- DIRECTOR SCIENCE TOUCHED UPON THIS EARLY BUT THE DECISION TO SUSPEND THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS UP LED TO SOME OF THIS FRAUD CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE THEIR AND WHAT'S BEING DONE TO SAFEGUARD- THOSE TAXPAYER DOLLARS FROM FRONT CONTINUING TO. EXIST IN THE SYSTEM. LET ME TRY TO ADDRESS THAT AND THEN- HELLO YES YOU CAN DISCUSS MORE OF IT. SO AS I SAID I WASN'T THERE FOR SOME OF THE DECISIONS WERE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE PROCESS OF. WHEN THE PROCESSING THESE CLAIMS. ARE THROUGH OUR TECHNOLOGY OUR SYSTEM BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN. AND FOR THOSE OF THE MEMBERS FEEL ARE WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT'S A VERY BAD SIGN AND IF YOU PUSH THE SYSTEM WHAT'S BEGINNING TO SLOW DOWN IN THE BALLING THAT WE HAD THEN THE SYSTEM OF THE CRASH. I THINK THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS IN THE DECISION WAS MADE AT THE TIME. THAT'S IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY I WOULD JUST THAT YOU KNOW- FROM FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE. I MEAN I CAN'T FIND ONE THAT WAS NOT A GOOD FAITH ATTEMPT. TO PAY PEOPLE WHO WERE DESPERATE FOR HELP- YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT THAT'S- IS SORT OF THE UNDERLYING- COMMENT THAT I WOULD MAKE ON ON SOME OF THE DECISIONS NOT HAVING BEEN HERE BUT I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THAT. WAS A BIG PIECE OF IT REMEMBER. YEAH AND I UNDERSTAND THE SUDDEN URGE AN UP TICK IN. TRYING TO ADDRESSED CLAIMANTS BUT YOU KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING TO IS THAT EDT REMOVE SOME OF THOSE SAFEGUARDS WHICH WAS OUTLINED IN THE AUTUMN. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE SAFEGUARDS WERE REMOVED THERE WAS ONLY FOR EXPEDIENCY BUT AT WHAT COST AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COSTS THAT BEING A MINIMUM OF TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF FRAUD. AND THEN I BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- COMMUNICATED WITH. YOUR DEPARTMENT- ASKING TO RE IMPLEMENT THOSE SAFEGUARDS SO CAN YOU HELP JUST EXPLAIN THAT INTERACTION AND HOW THAT WAS FIXED. ALL RIGHT LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE SAFEGUARDS ARE NOW. EDT MISTER CRITICAL SKATEPARKS AND WE HAVE MORE SAFEGUARDS EVEN IN THE INDIAN WHILE SUGGESTED TO US. NANCY DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THEIR- I MEAN JUST AS AS YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED IN PART OF YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT- THE SAFEGUARDS THAT WE HAVE NOW WITH I. D. NY AT THOMSON REUTERS AND STOPPING CRIED AT THE AT THE FRONT DOOR- THAT. THAT'S ALL I WOULD ADD BASICALLY I MEAN WE ARE WHERE WE HAVE A TASK FORCE WITH YOU KNOW ALL WE ASKED AND THE DA'S- IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE FRAUD- WE YOU KNOW THERE'S ARREST THAT'S BEEN MADE AS AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED- YOU KNOW I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE STOPPED FRAUD. AT THE FRONT DOOR AND GOING FORWARD- THAT THAT IS THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING IN. IS STOPPING FRAUD BEFORE. PAYMENTS GET MADE. WHAT GOT A DEADLY SAY LET ME JUST ADD SOMETHING TO THAT- I KNOW THAT THE AUDITORS TALKED ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE NEEDING TWO THOUSAND TEN. SECTOR WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED COMPLETELY. R. YES WE HAVE A LARGE BACK PACK. GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND- CHECK ON THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CERTIFICATIONS. BUT I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THIS EXECUTIVE TEAM IS COMMITTED. COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE. NO ONE WAS ASKING WAS TYPES OF QUESTIONS. AND TEN YEARS FROM NOW. I APPRECIATE THAT OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WISH THESE REFORMS WERE IMPLEMENTED PREVIOUSLY FROM THE LAST DOWNTURN AND- THAT FIRST REPORT THAT TO TWENTY TEN TWENTY ELEVEN THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO NOW- DO APPRECIATE THAT BUT- I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA EAGERLY. WAIT YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE ARE REPORTED REALLY YOUR I HOPE WE CAN JOIN TOGETHER IN CALTRANS PARTNERS IN THE LEGISLATION- THAT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED SO FAR IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THESE REFORMS THAT YOU SEEM TO WANT TO EMBRACE AND HOPING YOU DO AND THAT'S GENUINE- BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IT. THERE'S STILL. STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND JUST THE OVERALL WHAT IS THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS- NOT ONLY THE DEFICIENCIES BUT- HOW ARE WE MOVING TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL RECEIVING THE BENEFITS THAT THEY NEED I THINK THAT. YOU CONTINUE TO HEAR A LOT OF MEMBERS KIND OF COME BACK TO THOSE TWO POINTS AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO CLEAR INDICATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT. OUR GETTING THERE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE AUDITOR WAS IDENTIFYING IS A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN- IN PLACE. IN THE ECONOMY THAT WE EXPECT AN UPTICK OVER INTO THE- FOR ME DRESS THAT SO I HAVE SAID THAT WE ARE USING BOTH THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMEND. AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR. AS A CORPORATE OR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FOR ONE ISSUE IF YOU JUST RAISED AT THE END THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE. YOU KNOW. THAT YES A CRITICAL. ELEMENT OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT. SHOULD BE ANTICIPATING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SCALE UP ON ON THE TURN OF A DIME IT'S JUST- IMPOSSIBLE. YES WE HEAR WHAT THE AUDITORS. HERE WHAT A RENTER'S HAS SAID WE WILL BE PER NEXT TIME. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT- I HAVE A THIS QUESTIONS WHEN I KNOW I A NUMBER OF MIKE'S MY COLLEAGUES UP AND TO FOR TO THEIR QUESTIONS AND COME TO MY THANK YOU MISTER OKAY MISTER SAW- MISTER BERMAN HAS BEEN WAITING FOR- ON THE WEBEX. AND THEN LET ME SHARE THAT- NEXT AFTER MR BERMAN WILL BE MISSED **** HORRIBLE OFF THEN MR PATTERSON. AND THEN WE'LL TRY TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE ELSE AS SOON AS WE CAN BUT- MR BERMAN EUROPE. THANK YOU CHAIR DALY- AND THANK YOU ORDER HOWL AND THAT YOUR TEAM FOR YOUR GREAT WORK AND THANK YOU DIRECTOR FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY AS EGREGIOUS IS THE FINDINGS OF THESE AUDITS ARE THEY DID NOT COME AS A SURPRISE NOT TO ME NOT MY STAFF AND NOT THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING TO INTERACT WITH EDT SINCE THIS PANDEMIC BEGAN. BECAUSE FOR ELEVEN MONTHS NOW WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF EDIE'S. THERE ARE TOO MANY CAN GOAL EDT HAS FAITH DURING CRISIS. PREVENTING FRAUD VERSUS PAYING LEGITIMATE CLAIM EFFICIENTLY. THE LAST ELEVEN MONTHS HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT TRADEOFF BETWEEN THESE TWO PURPOSES. EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC THERE WAS A DECISION MADE TO ALLOW CLAIMANTS TO RECEIVE THEIR CLAIMS WITHOUT CERTIFYING ARE PROVIDING ID VERIFICATION. THIS COMPLIMENTS OUT FASTER BUT A LETTER SKYROCKETING FRAUD. THEN AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO LIMIT FRIDAY. LEAVING PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS AND HUNGER CUT OFF FROM THEIR BENEFITS WITHOUT ANY WARNING. THE PENDULUM KEEPS SWINGING WILDLY CREATING CONSTANT CHAOS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH NO HOPE OF REACHING A STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM. YOUR JOB DVDS JOB IS TO PAY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS THE MONEY THEY PUT INTO THE SYSTEM AND TO NOT PAY OUT FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. FOR NEARLY ELEVEN MONTHS EVD HAS BEEN FAILING AT BOTH JOBS. A LOT HAS BEEN COVERED TODAY- I DON'T TO FOCUS ON THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMS THAT YOU NEED BE SUSPENDED IN BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND THE NEW YEAR WITHOUT ANY NOTICE TO CONSTITUENTS LET ALONE TO US LEGISLATORS AND OUR STAFFS. YOU NEED THE SENT CRYPTIC AND CONFUSING NOTICES TO ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIA. TELLING THEM THAT THEIR CLAIMS WERE FROZEN DUE TO SUSPICION OF FRAUD. AND PROVIDED NO CLEAR PLAN FOR WHEN THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVE THEIR IDENTITY AND START RECEIVING PAYMENTS AGAIN. NOT ONLY WAS THIS A CRUEL BLOW AT A TIME WHEN THERE WERE EVEN FEWER PEOPLE TO HELP THEM IN BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR. BUT CONFUSING LANGUAGE IN THE NOTICE CREATED UNNECESSARY FEAR AND ANXIETY BECAUSE CONSTITUENTS MY CONSTITUENTS TOM THEY THEMSELVES WERE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE GOVERNMENT. WITH SOME WONDERING IF THEY NEEDED TO HIRE LAWYERS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. TWO WEEKS AFTER THEIR CLAIM WAS FROZEN THEY WERE GIVEN TEN DAYS TO VERIFY THROUGH ID DOT ME. I THIRD PARTY VENDOR. BEFORE THEIR CLAIM IT WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED. I DID ON THE WAS IT IS THAT. OUR CONSTITUENTS DID THEIR BEST TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND WERE CONFRONTED WITH OBSCENE WAIT TIMES THAT NEVER BY. MYSELF TOLD ME ABOUT ONCE WHO HAD A FORTY ONE HOUR A WEEK. WHAT MY STAFF INQUIRED ABOUT WAIT TIMES THEY WERE TOLD BY EDT THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS NEEDED TO GET THROUGH THE I'D BE DOWN THE PROCESS BEFORE EDT COULD DO ANYTHING. AND THAT THERE WAS NO WAY FOR MY STAFF TO INTERVENE OR ASSIST MY CONSTITUENTS. DURING THE ID GOT ME PROCESS. I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW MUCH SUFFERING AND PAIN THAT DECISION TO FREEZE THOSE CLAIMS WITHOUT ANY PLANNED COST. A LOT BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF HUNDREDS OF MY CONSTITUENTS. ROGER WHO IS PUT THROUGH THIS NIGHT. RAJU'S CLAIM WAS ON THE SAN THIRTY. FOR TWO WEEKS ALL EDT CAN TELL US WHAT HE NEEDED TO WAIT A WAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE ID DAMILOLA. HE SPENT FOUR TO FOUR HOURS A DAY TRYING TO VERIFY HIS IDENTITY WELL I. D. DOT THE SHOW TO EIGHTH CONSTANT HOUR WEEK TIME THAT NEVER WENT. I'M BI WEEKLY CALL MICE TO SECONDS TO WHO GOT THROUGH I D. DOT SIX TO HAVE THE CLAIMS UP BY THE END OF JUNE. WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN. EDT ALSO REVIEW. THAT THEY WERE. ON THAT THEY WERE. ON THE PROBE. NEED TO POST BACK ONLINE AFTER. HAVE BEEN VERY. TWO EDT SUSPENDED POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMS IN BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEARS WITHOUT ANY HEADS UP TO THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS THAT HAVE BEEN SERVING AS THE DE FACTO EDT CALL CENTER FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS FOR MONTHS. BECAUSE THE REAL CALL CENTER DOESN'T WORK AND YOU HAD NO PLAN FOR HOW TO GET THOSE CLAIMS BACK ON TRACK QUICKLY- APPROVE. THAT PLAN. ROGERS CASE LANGUISHED IN THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS A HARDSHIP. ROGER AND HIS SON ARE LIVING OUT OF THEIR CAR HE RAN OUT OF GAS HE RISKED HAVING HIS PHONE PLAN CANCEL WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HIM OFF FOR MY OFFICE THE ONLY LIFELINE TO GETTING HIS BENEFITS BACK UP- AND MY STAFF HAVE SOUGHT HELPLESS. TO RESOLVE ROGERS CASE AND SO MANY OTHER CASES TO TRY TO HELP MY CONSTITUENTS SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY DID HE SUSPEND ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMS IN BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEARS BEFORE FINALIZING THE PLAN TO GET THOSE PLANS BACK ON. WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS EVEN CLOSE TO A RESPONSIBLE DECISION TO MAKE. LET ME LET ME ADDRESS THE FIRST PART OF HER. DOES CRIMES STOP AS OF MARK. THAT DISK THROUGH THE- THANKS WRITERS FRAUD BERMAN. THE FIRST EXAMPLES ARE THE HOW MOST PEOPLE WOULD IDENTIFY YEARS YEAH OBVIOUSLY- I YOU KNOW I HEAR THE STORY ARE ARE YA. ALL RIGHT I WILL APPRECIATE THE OUT. THE THAT PEOPLE ARE TO MORE I GOT CALLS MURDER ALL THE TIME- SO- WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS WE HAVE A REALLY COULD TO WORK WITH A. TO LET PEOPLE KNOW CLEARLY. IN EVIDENCE. WHEN WE'RE THIS TYPE OF INACTION. AS FAR AS CONCERNED THIS WILL NEVER AGAIN. IT IS A OF THE- SO YOU KNOW. I SAID EARLIER I NOT A BIG PERSON DOING A LOT OF PLAN I BELIEVE IN A- WELL PEOPLE HAVE. YOU GOT IT FROM STRIKE TEAM WHO GOT IT FROM OUR IT'S NOW IMPORTANT FOR WOULD G. TO PROVIDE LEAD TO MAKE SURE THAT LISTINGS HAVE. THAT OFTEN ARE CLEAR THAT ARE PARTNERS WITH A LETTER IS. FOR MACINNES. OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS- WHO ARE THEY ARE NOT IN A POSITION. TO BE WITHOUT MONEY. NO THIS IS NOT LIKE A WELL PAID TECH WORKER WHO LIVES IN A NICE HOME AND- HAS SAVINGS BECAUSE THEIR PAID TO WELL. ARE BARELY PAID. YEAH SO I WANT YOU TO I JUST ON THAT PART THE LAWN THIS. ON THAT. I THIS IN THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO IS NOT LOST ON. I APPRECIATE AND- YOU ARE ARE STRUGGLING SO MUCH- AND HAVE BEEN FOR LONG AND THE NURSE. STRUGGLE SO MUCH- BECAUSE THEY POUR THEIR AND- INTO THIS WORK AND YOU KNOW I HAD CALL WITH MOST IS ON FOR NIGHT BECAUSE THEY GOT EMAIL FOR AND- WHO SAID IT KNOW ALL. YOU KNOW NOTHING TO ME I'M I'M KICKED OUT ON THE STREET BECAUSE I WAS ON A SOME- FOR MY PART IN AND KNOW I TO GIVE MY BEST AND NOW I'M OUT- AND THEN THAT HAS ON OUR TEAMS- ALL OF THE STATE NAY THEN- I'M I PRE THAT YOU'RE IN. THAT ALSO- YOU KNOW REALLY WE KIND OF THINGS. THE DECISION THAT WE AND THE IMPACT THEY WILL HAVE AND TRIED AT AND- THE. THE YOU KNOW CHILD THE IN THE IN AND STRESS THAT THAT THOSE DECISION WILL CAUSE BEFORE- AND GET AHEAD OF THAT AS MUCH AS- SO LET YOU THE FIRST THING THAT I CENTRAL WHY EXECUTIVE STAFF. WHEN I CAME IN. THERE TWO THINGS THAT ARE TO ME. QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK TOO MUCH TIME BUT HOW IS IT APPROPRIATE THAT. IN IN THIS IS GOING BACK TO THIS ISSUE. THAT CONSTITUENTS WERE GIVEN TEN DAYS TO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY VS THE SYSTEM THAT THAT WAS NOT. PREPARED FOR THE VOLUMES. THAT HAVE BEEN ARTIFICIALLY YOUR TREAT CREATED BY BY FREEZING ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FINANCE BUT BUT HE- DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO PROVIDE CONSTITUENTS WITH ANY TIMELINE. FOR WHEN HE WILL COMPLETE THEIR PART OF THE JOB- SERGEANTS TO JOINTS. HAD TEN DAYS TO GET THIS IDEA TO ME PROCESS. BUT HE NEVER PUT ANY DEADLINES ON ON YOURSELVES. WELL LET ME FIRST ADDRESS. THE TEN DAY ISSUE- THAT DOES WAS A- TO THIRTY DAYS. BECAUSE AS SOON AS IT BECAME MORE. AS SOON AS WE SAW THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH ID MISAKA PEOPLE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE. SO WE EXPECT TO BE. ABLE DID HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO GET BACK TO US- REGARDING THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION I'M GONNA ASK OUR CHIEF DEPUTY OF OPERATIONS. OR IF SHE HAS SOMETHING SHE WANTS TO ADD TO THIS ABSOLUTELY CARE WAS COMING HERE THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION AGAIN. YEAH WHY IS TAKES CARE WHY WHY ISN'T D. D. PUTTING COMMON ON THEMSELVES YEAH- TO FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE CERTAINLY NEED TO IMPROVE WITH OUR COMMUNICATION TO YOU AND CERTAINLY WITH THE CLIENTS IN THIS PARTICULAR NUCLEUS OF- OF THE SITUATION- IT WAS DONE IT WAS DONE TO ADDRESS FRAUD IT WAS DATED JUNE DRIVEN DECISION AS THE DIRECTOR HAS EXPRESSED. WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAD COMPLIMENTS COMPREHENSIVE DATA ANALYSIS ON SUSPECTED FRAUD IN HAND. A. AS YOU KNOW WITH ANY DATA. ONE TIME AND WE CERTAINLY ARE NOW UNDERTAKING UNDERTAKING A WHOLE FRAUD EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DATA IS ANALYZED THAT THESE DECISIONS ARE TIGHTER THAN THEY WERE THE FIRST TIME IN THIS THE GROUP THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY REFERRING TO WITH ALL. THAT WAS WIDER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT THAT'S WHERE WE NEED EXPERTISE AND EXPERT ANALYSIS TO COME IN HERE AND LOOK AT THOSE FILTERS AND WE'RE EXPECTING THAT ASSISTANCE TO JOIN US WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK WEEK AND A HALF. SO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION. BUT THE NET WAS TOO WIDE- THE DATA DID NOT SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD. I DID ME WOULD BE IMPACTED THE WAY IT WAS IN THAT CLAIMANTS WOULD BE IMPACTED THE WAY IT WAS. WHICH IS WHY THE DIRECTOR JUST SAID AS SOON AS WE HAVE THOSE INDICATIONS OF FOLKS WERE WAITING ON LONG. WAITING IN A LINE ITEM IN EXORBITANT MANY TIMES WE ACTUALLY SPEND THAT TIME FRAME TO THE THINK IT'S- FEBRUARY THE FIFTEENTH WHICH IS AN EXTRA THIRTY DAYS. BUT THE REASON WHY THERE IS A TIME FRAME BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T IT IS ABOUT PRIDE. FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT RESPOND THAT NEVER ATTEMPT. TO GO THROUGH IT ME THAT NEVER ATTEMPT TO REALLY VALIDATE THEIR IDENTITY. THIS IS THE GROUP THAT YOU KNOW HOW THERE'S THE STRONGEST INDICATIONS OF FRAUD. AND CERTAINLY WE WILL CONTINUE IN THE PROMISED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE FILTERS. SO THAT WE ARE ONLY- IDENTIFYING THOSE THAT HAVE THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST LEVEL OF. RISK OF FRAUD BUT THAT IS WHY BECAUSE THERE IS AN. END TO THIS AFTER. PROBABLY PROBABLY. TIME IS. SO AND I AND I AM THE NEED TO PUT A LOT BUT THEN SHE MEDIA AFFORDABLE ON A MINUTE OF YOU KNOW ONE HE'S GOT YOU KNOW I HAVE. IS A PROCESS. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S CITY THESE THAT ACTUALLY CONCRETE DOUBLE FOR ONE YEAR AND- THAT IT DOES PART OF THE WORLD IN THE BOOK OF THE- OF A WORKING THROUGH I THINK IT'S- FAIR I THINK WE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR DEADLINES SO LET US TAKE THAT BACK AND GO BACK AND DO A BETTER JOB. COMING FORWARD WITH WHAT CLAIMS CAN EXPECT WHEN THEY ARE IN ANY OF THESE WORKLOADS- ARE WORKING SITUATIONS WITH US. WE'RE SAYING IT'S TEN TO THIRTEEN DAYS AFTER YOU CLEAR ID ME. SO I'M GONNA. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GERALD OTHER FOR MY COLLEAGUES. ALL RIGHT MR BERMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION- NEXT IS. ASSEMBLY WOMAN TASHA BOERNER HORVATH THEN MR JIM PATTERSON THEN WENDY CARILLO THEN SENATOR BAKER SO- YOU ALL KNOW YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THE TIME YOU'RE GOING TO TALK THANK YOU THANK YOU- I WANT TO THANK OUR ORDER AND- BOTH COMMITTEES FOR CONVENING THIS MEETING TODAY AND FOR THE HARD WORK OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE- I WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE EDT. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS AUDIT IS THE BLUEPRINT THIS AUDIT IS RECOGNIZING THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE DEPARTMENT HAD IN SERVING CALIFORNIANS SO I DON'T ACCEPT THAT THIS IS THE BLUEPRINT. THIS IS CORRECTING WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED BEFORE AND A BLUEPRINT IS PLANNING THE PATH TO IMPROVEMENT SO WHEN I HEAR THAT I GET VERY VERY CONCERNED AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FIRST CALL RESOLUTION BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY CONSTITUENTS WITH MY CONSTITUENTS. THEY'RE CALLING AT AND CALLING EIGHTY I'M CALLING AT ONLY TO FINALLY GET A HOLD OF SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T FIX THEIR PROBLEM AND THEN THE EDV PERSON SAYS GO TALKED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TASHA BOERNER HORVATH. WE WANT WE WANT TO BE A PER BUT WE CAN'T BE A PRO OF WHEN YOU'RE PEOPLE ARE SENDING BACK TO US BECAUSE THEY CANNOT RESOLVE. THEIR FIRST CONTACT PROBLEMS. SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AROUND THAT- BUT I REALLY LIKE TO GET SOME CONCRETE ANSWERS- I'VE THREE QUESTIONS ONE PLEASE CAN YOU IDENTIFY THE REASONS. WHY EDT EMPLOYEES CANNOT RESOLVE OUR CONSTITUENTS ISSUES ON FIRST CONTACT. IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE MANUAL ENTRY OF NOT BECAUSE ANY OF THOSE THINGS WHY ARE THEY NOT RESOLVING THAT AND WHY ARE THEY SENDING THEM BACK. TO LEGISLATIVE OFFICES. WHEN THE FIRST ADDRESSING TO BUCKLE COOPER BECAUSE I THINK I WAS NOT CLEARING UP. SO I DID MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING WILL CHECK FOR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. IS STANDARD- PRACTICE IS FOR YOU TO GET LESSONS LEARNED. ABSOLUTE TIGHTER BY BLUE CROSS THE PROBLEM. WITH THE IMAGINED BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM NOT THE GENERAL GOSSIP ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEMS WHAT WHAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS MISSION I REFER TO THOSE AT THE STRIKE GENE AND THE- AUDITORS. BECAUSE WE NEED TO. PUT INTO THOSE ROOT CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM YOU FOR OF. LOOP BRIDGE IS DESIGNED. THE BLUE CREEK. THIS IS THE BLOOPER FOR GETTING INTO A IS GOING WRONG. AND WHAT NEEDS TO. THE CORRECT NOW. THE FOR THE- WILL BE THE THIS PRICE. AND THE TECHNOLOGY SITUATION WAS WORKING MORE CLOSELY SO I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT MAKING IT CLEAR. WONDER OUR CARAMEL HAVE **** ANSWER THE REST OF. THE QUESTION. WELL I'M JUST GOING TO. CAROL WILLIAMS JUST SAID STEPS SHOULD NEVER REFER BACK TO YOU ANY OF YOU. ANY OF YOUR- OWN AND WE DID RECEIVE THAT OUR COMMUNICATION I BELIEVE EARLY LAST WEEK AND WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY INTERESTED WITH ALL CONTACT CENTER STAFF IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEXCUSABLE- SO. IF I COULD JUST HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT- THE MAGNETIZATION OF THE OF THE CONTACT CENTER THAT ARE DIRECTOR SPOKEN ABOUT ONE OF THE KEY FOUNDATIONS OF A WELL RUN EFFICIENT. MODERN CONTACT CENTRE IT'S CALLED MONITORED THAT IS THE BASIC AND SO WHAT WE ARE ON THIS QUEST TO MODERNIZE THE CONTACT CENTER. BASIC TOOLS ARE MISSING AS WELL AS OUR SEARCH FOR IT THE ADVANCED TOOLS BASIC TOOLS CALL MONITORING WERE ALL CALLS ARE MONITORED AS A AS A COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING TOOL BACK WITH THE EMPLOYEE BUT ALSO SERVES AS A- ACCOUNTABILITY TOOL. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT HAVE WE DO LIVE MONITORING. ONLY GOES SO FAR SO WE ARE AS MUCH AS WE'RE INTERESTED IN HIRING GREAT FOLKS AND WE DO HAVE FANTASTIC EMPLOYEES KEEPING THEM WELL TRAINED AND MINIMIZING OR JUST PROVIDING THE TRAINING THAT'S NEEDED SO THAT THEY CAN BE OF BENEFIT. TO OUR CLIENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE'RE ALSO PART OF THAT GOOD SHE TRAINING IS- IT IS PART OF CALL GOOD CALL MONITOR AND GOOD COMMUNICATION WITH OUR STAFF- BACK TO TRAINING JUST A LITTLE BIT IT HAS BEEN- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE TO IMPROVE THE TRAINING IS OUR ADVANCED TRAINING AND THAT'S FOR- THE HIGHEST LEVEL CLASSIFICATION IS NOW THIRTEEN WEEKS. IT IS A CONTINUED IT IS A JOURNEY BECAUSE THIS IS VERY ADVANCED BUT- THE STRIKE TEAM HAD EARLIER RECOMMENDED TO STOP TRAINING AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE NEED OUR FANS SUPPOSED TO BE IT- RESOLVING CLAIMS. AND NOW THAT. WE ARE MOVING THROUGH THAT. THE TRAINING AND THE HIRING IS A MORE OF A CONTINUOUS BASIS SO THAT WHILE WE'RE HIRING NINE HUNDRED FOLKS THIS MONTH APRIL IT WILL BE MORE CONTINUOUS AND IT'S NOT JUST WHAT WE HAVE VACANCY. IT IS ANTICIPATION OF VACANCIES AND ANTICIPATION OF THE MOMENT TRICIA RIGHT THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS VERY HIGH THAT WILL KEEP US- AT A HIGH. LEVEL TO RESPOND TO CLIENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILLIAM OF READ MY MIND ABOUT THE SECOND QUESTION BECAUSE I WAS ON. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE EXPECTATIONS YOU'RE STUDYING WITH US. AND OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND THE DISCONNECT WITH THE AUDITOR IS CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A VIEW OF A MOUNTING BACKLOG. RIGHT AND THEN YOU NEED IT YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. WHAT I DON'T SEE IN THIS. IS HOW YOU INTEND THE PLAN IN THE NEXT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS. TO PREPARE FOR ANY MORE SURGES IN ET DECLINES YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING IN THE LAST YEAR HAS STAYED CONSTANT. IS FLUCTUATED AND SEEMS LIKE YOU SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR THAT SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW TO TRAIN PEOPLE ON FIRST CALL RESOLUTION TO THE MORE FIRST CALLED THE RESULT ON THE FIRST CONTACT. THE LESS BACKLOG YOU HAVE IN YOUR DO YOU HAVE A HUGE BACKLOG. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON TRAINING- TO A TRAINING TO INCREASE FIRST CALL RESOLUTION RIGHT NOW TODAY TOMORROW YOU KNOW NEXT WEEK. AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND IF YOU CAN PLEASE IDENTIFY. WHAT EDT SURGES YOU EXPECT IN THE NEXT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING TODAY TO PREPARE THEM SO WE'RE NOT SITTING HERE IN SIX MONTHS AND HAVE TO REPEAT. THIS WHICH WE'VE ALL GONE THROUGH FOR THE LAST YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAROL WILLIAMS. WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS. WELL LET ME BACK UP ONE OF THE BIGGEST EFFICIENCIES THAT EDT HAS REALIZED WHICH HAS FREED UP STAFF FROM MANUAL WORK WAS I CAN BE IN OCTOBER WE CANNOT PROCESS CLAIMS EFFICIENTLY IF FOR HAVING TO TRY TO MANUALLY ADJUST INTOTOUCH INTO PROCESS CLAIMS AS WE HAVE BEEN- IN PAST TIMES I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY TESTIMONY EARLIER WAS CORRECT. PRIOR TO ID ME WE WERE AT A 60% AUTOMATION 40% MANUAL AND THAT 40% WAS HUGE I DID ME YOU'RE NOW MANUALLY PROCESSING CLAIMS AT A RATE OF 90% 89290% BUT THAT LEAVES US 10% TO TOUCH. THE MORE AUTOMATION THAT WE CAN BRING IN IN AND THE KRUGMAN'S IT FREES UP STAFF TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH CLIENTS ON THEIR MOST- OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CALLS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE- WE'RE PRO ACTIVELY NOW COMMUNICATING WITH CLAIMANTS TO REDUCE THE COST THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO CALL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WERE TEXTING. WOULD HONOR- WE ARE CALLING TO MAKE AN OUTBOUND CALLS QUITE HONESTLY TO CLAIM IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S. PART OF THE CLAIM PROCESS. WOMEN HAVE TO COME BACK TO EATING AND RESTART IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE EVERY TWO WEEK. YOU FILE YOUR CLAIM ONCE BUT YOU HAVE TO RETURN TO FIX THAT YOU CAN STILL UNEMPLOYED AND YOU- QUALIFY FOR BENEFITS. WELL OF OUR CLIENTS. EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND RIGHT NOW HAVE NOT RETURNED. IF THEY'RE NOT RETURNING BECAUSE THEY ARE BENDING THEIR THEIR CLAIMS THAT'S FOR THE BEST REASON THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYED RE EMPLOY. BUT I FEAR IS THAT THERE'S STILL COMMUNICATION GAP AND THERE'S A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND THE NEED TO RETURN AND RECERTIFY AND THEIR CLAIM A LITTLE THE SIT THERE SO THE OUTBOUND COMMUNICATION CHANNELS OVER CREATING THE CHAOS AND TAX THAT I MENTIONED WE ARE LITERALLY DOING TO MAKE SURE FOLKS UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE PROCESS WE HAVE INFORMATION ON THEIR YOU WILD ONLINE ACCOUNT. AS WELL AS- THANK YOU TO BE GOTTEN INTO VIDEOS MAKE IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AND IS LESS COMPLICATED BECAUSE- THE PROCESS WE HAVE PRESENTED IN A VERY COMPLICATED WAY OVER TIME- I'M TRYING TO DEMYSTIFY. THE CLAIM FILING EXPERIENCE SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO CALL. IN WHEN WE DO WE ARE ABSOLUTELY AVAILABLE SO THE CONTINUED HIRING. THE MODERNIZE TRAINING. NOW THIRTEEN WEEKS NOT SIX MONTHS. BE CREATING CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION PUSHING IT TO CLAIMANTS WE ARE SEEING- DID RESULT IN MATH BUT QUITE HONESTLY WHEN WE BRING ON NEW PROGRAMS AS WE HAVE NOW WITH THE NEWS. YOU KNOW TEARS UP ACT- THIS IS WHEN WE HAVE TO BE MOST AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THESE ARE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE- THEY'RE UNSURE OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY AND BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE PEAKS WE CONTINUE TO REALLY STOP OR IN THE PART OF SERVICE. BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING FOR AND THE DIRECTOR SPOKE ABOUT OUR COMMAND CENTER. THAT'S WHAT THE REASONS WHY IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING FOR EDT IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF SERVICE IT WAS DECENTRALIZED IT IS NOW BEING CENTRALIZED SO ALL THE COMPONENTS THE EFFICIENCIES THAN. MODERN TOOLS AND QUITE HONESTLY THE RIVER VIEW OF WHY CLAIMANTS ARE CALLING AND THEIR FEEDBACK AND TO ENSURE WE UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD WE'RE DOING WITH FIRST CALL RESOLUTION. IS NOW WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AND WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO POINT OUT TO YOU AND HOPEFULLY MORE THAN THAT WOULD. BE ABLE TO DO BETTER. THANK YOU. IF I IF I CAN ADD ON TO THAT AS WELL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN THAT MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE HAVE TWO GOALS AT AT- AT EDS TO. YOU KNOW PAY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS AND TO PREVENT FRAUD AND YOU KNOW THEY OFTEN DO- YOU KNOW INTERSECT BUT I THINK NOW THAT WE HAVE. I KNOW NOW THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW A DVD THAT SEES YOU KNOW 35% OR SO OF- ATTENDED APPLICANTS LIKE THEY STOP THEM AT BASS STOP THEM. YOU KNOW AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THOMSON REUTERS- AS OUR FRONT DOOR DOOR CHECK. ON FRIDAY THAT WE CAN THEN REALLOCATE THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE WERE SPENDING A HUGE CHUNK OF YOU KNOW ONE AND TWO. ON FRAUD. ON THAT WE CAN NOW WE ALLOCATE THOSE PEOPLE TO PAYMENT LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS AND THAT'S ANOTHER- I THINK IT'S A THING THAT HAPPENS THAT YOU KNOW. WE SEE INTERNALLY AT EDT BUT- I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE A HUGE. DIFFERENCE TO BE HONEST HELLO. THANK YOU. GOOD- THANK YOU MISTER FORMER IRVINE MR PATTERSON IS NEXT THEN MISSED CAREER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE AREA THAT I'D LIKE TO- EXPLORE HERE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH WHAT AMOUNTS TO THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE. TO THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THOSE WHO DID EVERYTHING THAT EDT ASK THEM TO DO. AND THEY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT. IN EMBARRASSING AND IN- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I THINK ARE THE DIRECT RESULT. OF WHAT THE AUDITOR HAS FOUND. MY OFFICE. HAS PROCESS BEEN IS PROCESSING RIGHT NOW. THREE THOUSAND CONSTITUENT CASES. ALL ABOUT E. D. D. OUR CALL VOLUMES ARE NOT GOING DOWN THERE GOING BACK A- THE CALLS THAT WE ARE GETTING. TO OUR OFFICE R. AS DESPERATE AS THEY HAVE BEEN- AND SO I JOIN WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE. IN SAYING THERE ARE FACES THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE. PEOPLE THAT I HAVE KNOWN IN FRESNO MY LIFETIME. I WAS THE MAYOR THERE FOR EIGHT YEARS I HAVE RADIO STATIONS IN THE AREA I NOW REPRESENT THEM IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEIR MESSAGE TO YOU. PLEASE HEAR OUR CRY. THE BUREAUCRATIC IMPEDIMENTS HERE HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY LAID OUT IN THE WATER. BUT I WANT YOU TO HEAR THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T IN THIS ROOM. BUT WHO I KNOW AND WHO MY OFFICE HAS DEALT WITH. I WANT TO FIRST ASK A QUESTION ABOUT- THE DEBIT CARDS. THOSE DEBIT CARDS WERE THE LIFELINE. THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY UNILATERALLY FROZEN. THE RESULT OF THAT HAS MEANT. THAT I HAVE RECEIVED PHONE CALLS FROM FRIENDS OF MINE IN THE DISTRICT. WHO WERE STANDING THAT THE CASH REGISTER. AT THE GROCERY STORE. AND HAD THEIR CAR DENIED. SO THEY NOT ONLY HAD TO WALK OUT OF THERE WITH NO. FOOD THEY WERE PUBLICLY EMBARRASSED. OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO THE FAILURES OF. EDT. AND I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT WELL I GUESS I HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IS. THIS IS SORT OF A THIS IS SORT OF A KICKBACK SCHEME. WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS. WHO HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH US SAYING. THAT THE FEES CHARGED ON THEIR DEBIT CARD. THEY ARE PAYING FOR. SO I WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS A FEE SHARING CONTRACT. THAT FEE SHARING CONTRACT. SPLITS IN SOME DEGREE THESE DAYS BETWEEN BANK OF AMERICA N. EDT. A CENTURY PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF GETTING THEIR OWN UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FROM PEOPLE WHO CAN BARELY BUY GROCERIES. FIRST OF ALL I WANNA KNOW THE JUSTIFICATION. FOR THIS PLEA THAT THAT THE SPLIT. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGES AND- HOW MUCH IS THE PERCENTAGE OF THE OF THE CHARGE. AND WHAT IS THE SPLIT BETWEEN EDIE DM BANK OF AMERICA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NATIVE AREAS WITH EDT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET BACK TO ON THAT I DO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE ARTICULATED I AM AWARE OF THAT HOWEVER I AM NOT AWARE OF THE EXACT SPLIT- I. WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE CONTRACT. I'M GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW IS THAT THIS IS A TYPICAL TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT. MADE BY BENEFIT PROGRAMS- JOHN. ACTUALLY CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THE STATE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY HEY. BANK OF AMERICA THIS IS HOW THEY GET PAID CORRECT IT'S A ZERO DOLLAR CONTRACT CORRECT. IS IT NOT A FACT THAT THE- EXTRACTION OF THAT. PERCENTAGE FIFTY COMES OUT OF THE PROCEEDS THAT WOULD BE GOING TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. I I'M NOT 1100% SURE ON HOW THE CONTRACT IS STRUCTURED I APOLOGIZE AND WE CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK TO YOU. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- I JOIN- OTHER MEMBERS. WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION FOR A LONG TIME. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M JOINING WITH THE MEDIA THAT HAS BEEN ASKING THIS REPEATEDLY OF YOUR OPERATION ONLY TO BE TOLD. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. THIS IS PUBLIC RECORDS PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW AND BE ABLE TO EXPRESS IT TO US. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS IS MY EX IS ALSO SIR IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A COPY OF THE CONTRACT. SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO HIDE IT FROM YOU BUT WE DO WANT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION. I CANNOT SPECULATE ON WHY. THE INFORMATION IS NOT SHARED WITH YOU PREVIOUSLY BUT YOU WILL GET NOW. YEAH I WANT TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS BUT IT'S THE IT'S THE BOTTOM LINE HERE. WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE BARELY HANGING ON OR HAVING THEIR DEBIT CARDS. ARE FROZEN AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT. THEY END UP HAVING TO PAY FEES FOR THE PRIVILEGE. I MEAN THIS THIS HAS TO BE ON WILD AND IT HAS TO BE. EXPLAINED OTHER COLLATERAL DAMAGES YEAH. YEAH LET DOWN THE GUARD RAILS. IT NOT ONLY OPEN THE TV APP FOR FRAUD. BUT IT ALSO OPEN IT UP FOR IDENTITY THEFT. AND I RECEIVED COUNTLESS CALLS FROM PEOPLE IN THE DISTRICT ARE SCARED TO DEATH. THAT THEIR OWN EMPLOYMENT. WAS TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE. AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE. A TEN NINETY NINE G. I THEY'RE GOING TO YOU'RE GOING TO BE FLOODED. WITH CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE GOING TO BE SEEING WHAT THEIR TAXES ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AND YET THEY EITHER DIDN'T FILE OR THEY HAD. THEIR ON EMPLOYMENT TAKEN BY FRAUDSTERS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A- PHONE. NUMBER STOOD UP FOR PEOPLE TO CALL. AND I TRY TO GET THIS RESOLVED. I HAVE NOW A GROWING LONG LIST OF MEMBERS IN MY COMMUNITY WHO CANNOT. GET THROUGH THAT PHONE NUMBER. SO HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER PHONE NUMBER IN A CURRENTLY A CALL CENTER- THAT IS FAILING OFF A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS. LOOK EDT. YOU'VE GOT TO CORRECT THIS. AND THE ONLY WAY IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ZERO OUT. THESE THESE THESE TAX FORM SHOWING. AN TO ASK PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH. A LONG CONVOLUTED PROCESS OF EXPLAINING THAT THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR BENEFITS. AND YET THEY'RE BEING TAXED FOR IT. NOW THE ONUS YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE ONUS ON THEM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S A HARDSHIP. SO WE KNOW THE FROM APRIL THROUGH OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. EDT RESPONDED TO LESS THAN 2% OF THE FRAUD REPORTS ONLINE. HERE'S WHAT THE AUDITOR HAS SAID. YOU NEED TO PUT UP ON THE WEBSITE FOR CUSTOMERS. AN EMAIL. SO THAT THEY CAN QUICKLY GET A RESOLUTION AND THE AUDITOR SAYS THEY WOULD LIKE THAT RESOLUTION ON THE WEBSITE POSTED CLEARLY TO SEE BY MID FEBRUARY. WHEN WILL THIS HAPPEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NANCY VARIOUS- I BELIEVE THAT IT IS UP ON THE WEBSITE NOW IT IS OUR ASK ET DE IT'S A DROP DOWN MENU AND THEN EMAIL AUTOMATICALLY GOES THERE'S A DROP DOWN FOR THE TEN NINETY NINE- QUESTION I BELIEVE THAT WAS PUT UP- I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT IT WAS RECENTLY LAST WEEK OR SO. OR SO. IS THAT A VERY CLEAR ICON WITH RESPECT TO TEN NINETY NINE IN OTHER WORDS THE AUDITOR HAS SAID. IT HAS TO BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR FACE AND IT HAS TO BE A CLEAR ONE CLICK. TO TELLING ME THEY GOT TO GO THROUGH A DROP DOWN TO GET THEIR- IT IS BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ON THE TEN NINETY NINE PAGE WE HAVE- A PAGE OF INFORMATION ON THE TEN NINETY NINES AND IT IS PART OF. ON THAT PAGE. SO IF SOMEONE IS LOOKING FOR TEN NINETY NINE INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE PART OF THAT PAGE. PRECISELY WHAT. WILL YOU BE DOING. WITH PEOPLE WHO CONTACT YOU TELLING YOU THE STORY THAT I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT CONSTITUENTS. HOW ARE YOU PLANNING TO ON WIND OF THE PROBLEM. THAT YOU CREATED. BY TAKING DOWN THE GUARD RAILS AND BY PROVIDING. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF MAIL GOING OUT ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WITH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND NAMES AND ADDRESSES AND- YOU CREATED THIS. YOU'VE GOT ON WIDER FOR THESE PEOPLE HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DO THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH CAROL WILLIAMS. WE'RE IN WINDING THAT- FIRST AND FOREMOST LET ME START WITH WITH WHAT'S MOST PRESSING OR ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT'S PRESSING. OF THIS WEEK OR LATE LAST WEEK WE'VE BEEN PUSHING OUT INFORMATION IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE- AND IT'S TAX INFORMATION IT IS FROM THE IRS BECAUSE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A NATIONAL NATIONWIDE PROBLEM. THESE TEN NINETY NINE JEEZ. THAT- THEY'RE NOT EALIZING CLAIMS ARE FILED IN IN THEIR OWN. IT USING THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER I'M OUT IN JUST A SECOND I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW WE ARE UNWINDING THAT WE WORK WITH THEM. BUT FROM A TAX PERSPECTIVE THE IRISES MESSAGE THEY'RE PUSHING IT OUT WE'RE PUSHING OUT OUT OUT AS WELL IS DUE TO THIS NATIONWIDE CRISIS- TAXPAYERS ARE BEING REQUESTED. AND ENCOURAGED TO FILE AS APPROPRIATE MEETING. WHAT LOBBY MIGHT HAVE A TEN NINETY NINE INCOME IN THEIR POSSESSION BUT THEY WERE NOT RECEIVING THOSE FUNDS IRISES DIRECTION IS DON'T REPORT IT. THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST BECAUSE YOUR STATE AGENCY WILL CATCH UP AND GIVE YOU THAT CORRECTED TEN NINETY NINE THAT WAS ZERO OUT- THOSE RECEIPTS SO. HOW DO. YOU HOW DO YOU INTEND TO CATCH UP. YOUR IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE SUGGESTING. DON'T REPORT IT SOONER OR LATER I'M LOOK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET REAL SCARED ABOUT NOT REPORTING TEN NINETY NINES. UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU WHAT ARE THE BILL'S GOING TO SAY IS THAT THE DON'T REPORTING. NO NO NO NO I'M GIVING YOU THE TOP LINE FOR THE JUST FOR THE TAX SITUATION WHEN THEY CONTACT US AND THE FASTEST WAY WILL BE THROUGH. THE ONLINE BECAUSE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THE- ASK EDT THE TIME I DO MY LINK- DID FRAUD. THERE WILL BE A PRE FILLED WORK SEE AND THAT SHE WILL BE ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT ALIGN AGENT WOULD ASK IT'S INFORMATION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DETERMINE. THE TRUE CLAIM IT FROM THE FRAUDSTER AND SEPARATE THEIR TRUE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SOME THAT CLAIM AND THE LAST STEP IS TO. ZERO OUT OF TEN NINETY NINE G. AND SEND THAT TO THE TRUE INDIVIDUAL THE VICTIM SO THAT'S THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE OF THE PROCESS. OR DID TO US. YOU WERE UNABLE TO DEFER BETWEEN FOR AND REAL CLAIMANTS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN FRAUDSTERS AND REAL CLAIMANTS BY A BY A CLAIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL. THAT I DIDN'T GET THIS. AND THERE'S AND SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO THEM HOW THEIR ADDRESS HOW LONG DO THEY LIVE THERE CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL THINGS THAT THE FRAUDSTER WOULD NOT BE IN POSSESSION OF. THEM CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF AN HAVE ACTIVITY YOU HAVE SEEN IN THAT PORTAL. IT'S BUSY IT IS TAX TIME AND WE ARE SENDING OUT UPWARDS OF SEVEN MILLION TEN NINETY NINE BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU THOUGH. WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO THE PROPERLY THROUGH THE IRISH GUIDELINES WITHHOLD SENDING TEN NINETY NINES THAT WE ABSOLUTELY- CLEAR INDICATIONS OF FRAUD SO YES IT'S NOT PERFECT. FOLKS ARE RECEIVING THEM STILL THAT DID NOT- FILE FOR BENEFITS POTENTIALLY AND WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM ONE ON ONE TWO. TO CLEAR THEM OF THAT REPORTING. AGAIN I HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE CLAIM THAT YOU CAN DO ALL OF THESE THINGS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS ARE DOING. UNDERSTOOD I DIED UNDERSTOOD. START WITH THE- THAT'S WHY I STARTED WITH THE TOP LINE THAT IF THEY DID NOT RECEIVE A TIME IN MIND THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THEIR TAXES BUT I'M I'M WONDERING ONE FILER THE CLAWBACK. HOW MANY PEOPLE AND HOW MUCH IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU KNOW THIS UNIQUE WITH THEIR PROCESS TO DETERMINE AYE YOU APPLICANTS. CLEAR ELIGIBILITY. WE THINK THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE TWO POINT FOUR MILLION I THINK THE AUDITOR HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT. THE ORTEZ IS GOING TO BE THREE MILLION HOURS. TO CLEAR THIS UP. DOES THE EDT REALLY IN TEN. TO MAKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DID NOTHING WRONG AND FOLLOW THE RULES EVEN WHEN YOU LOWER THE RULES SEND THEM BACK AND CHECK. SEND THEM BACK MONEY. HELLO THIS IS KIND OF MILITARY FOR THE QUESTION- SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO APPROACH THESE OVER BANKS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS- BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THEY'RE- GONNA BE LOOKING AT. THERE ARE NONE OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BENEFITS FROM US WHO MAY HAVE AN ECONOMIC HARDSHIP- YEAH THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE- SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN INCARCERATED IN COLLECTED BENEFITS THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT GONNA MEET AND HARDSHIP REQUIREMENTS WILL BE DOING. EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO RECOUP THOSE FUNDS- AMONGST THE MANY MECHANISMS WE HAVE TO DO SO. AS IT RELATES TO. ONE ESSENTIAL WORKER WHO MAY HAVE COLLECTED BENEFITS ON A WEEK IN WHICH THEY WORK AND THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION ON THEIR PART ABOUT. WHAT TO REPORT AND WE WILL WORK WITH THEM TO COMPLY HARDSHIP PROVISIONS ALLOWED. WITHIN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO. ACTUALLY WAVE THAT OUT OVER. ALL RIGHT YOU SAW THE AD OF THE AUDITORS. GRAPHICS ON THIS. WHERE THERE WAS A TYPICAL INDIVIDUAL. LEGITIMATELY ELIGIBLE FOR. THEIR BENEFITS. WHEN YOU LOWERED THE REQUIREMENTS OF REPORTING. THAT INDIVIDUAL. WORKED UP SOME PART TIME. AND IN FACT. NOTIFY DDD. AND THE RESULT WAS BETTER AT WAS THAT EDT NOW DETERMINED THAT THEY WERE AT FAULT. AND THAT THEY NOW HAVE TO. CLAIM A HARDSHIP WHY DO PEOPLE. TO GET ALL THE RULES FOLLOWED ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THEN WERE DEEMED SOMEHOW OVERPAID WHEN YOU. PUT THE RULES BACKUP OF WHATEVER. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO CLAIM A HARDSHIP BEG FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS WHEN IT WAS EDT THAT DID IT TO THEM WHY CAN'T YOU FIGURE THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF AND DEAL WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WELL LET ME SAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU HAVE AN APPRECIATION FOR THE DIFFICULT TO WORK ON. WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I WELCOME. SKINNER SO CONSTRUCTING THESE THINGS OUT. MARK KEVIN WOULD YOU FOR. RESPOND TO THIS QUESTION. YEAH I THINK IT DOESN'T PERTAIN TO TRYING TO GET SOME OF THESE FUNDS BACK FOR FOLKS WHO YOU KNOW MAY HAVE BEEN. RIGHT OR BENEFIT STERLING AUTO CERTIFICATION WE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ADDITIONAL. BURDEN OF ON WORKING THROUGH POTENTIAL HARDSHIP WAIVER REQUEST. HOWEVER AS YOU MENTIONED BY- CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE THERE IS A- WE DON'T WANT EMPLOYERS TO BE CHARGED FOR FUNDS NECESSARILY IN THE BAY- THE WORD GIVEN TO BENEFIT. CORPORATE TO INDIVIDUAL THROUGH PROVIDED BENEFITS- WINDOWS INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY. BACK AS I MENTIONED BEFORE YOU KNOW FOR THESE FOLKS WHO ARE IN CASES WHERE THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY DEFRAUDING THE DEPARTMENT WHERE YOU NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO RECOUP THOSE FUNDS- WITHOUT DOING A SORT OF BLANKET WAIVER OF THE- OF ALL THE OVER PAYMENT DOLLARS. YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THEM ANA ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO GATHER SOME FACTS SO. OR INTENT IS TO BE A BIT MORE SURGICAL APPROACH TO COLLECTING THOSE FUNDS BACK- ALSO PROVIDE AN AVENUE FOR PEOPLE. WHO ARE HAVING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. AND WHILE IT'S- OBVIOUSLY. AN IDEAL THE THERE WOULD BE AN- A INTERACTION THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE PART. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT FURTHER PUTTING PEOPLE AND ECONOMIC DISTRESS- IF TAKING THOSE FUNDS BACK WOULD DO STUFF. WELL AGAIN I. APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO- ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE YOU'RE DODGING AROUND MY BASIC POINT. THAT BASIC POINT IS YOU WERE THE FOLKS THAT PULLED DOWN THE GUARDRAILS. DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. THOSE INDIIDUALS REPORTED TO YOU THAT THEY WORKED A LITTLE WHILE. RIGHT AND THEN THERE CAUGHT UP. IN A CLUB IT WAS YOUR LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND YOUR UNILATERAL REDUCTION OF THE GUARDRAILS. THAT OPENED THAT PERSON WHO FOLLOWED ALL YOUR RULES AND REPORTED TO BE NOW IN A POSITION TO BE CLAWED BACK. DOZEN TDS HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT ACTIVITY OF COURSE OF COURSE- EDT HAS SOME RESPONSIBIITY SO LET ME RESPOND TO THAT SO THAT WE DON'T GO ARE YOU FAR IN THIS. YOU HEARD A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT HOW. CAN YOU BRING THEM UP YOURSELF ABOUT HOW EASY HE- ACTS THE GUARDRAILS. THIS HARDSHIP- THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW SHOULD PEOPLE BE TO STOP BECAUSE THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED ONCE EACH QUARTER UP AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THEY SHOULD BE ARE YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR THAT HOWEVER WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THIS WEBI OF THE GUARD RAILS. ALL OVER AGAIN. FIND AT THE WE HAVE LET PEOPLE IN WITH ALL THE PAYMENTS. OKAY AND PAY THEM BACK I SHOULD NEVER HAVE CLEANED UP NOW IF YOU'RE ASKING THIS IS GARCIA OR MISTER THOMPSON WHO DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE COLOR OR THE DIRECTIONS ARE WE GOING TO CHASE AFTER THEM TO GET THEIR MONEY NO WE'RE NOT WE HAVE A PROCESS FOR THAT AND WE'LL KNOW MORE WHISKEY THE PROCESS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WALL INSISTED ON AND WE WANT YOU TO KNOW WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY SO WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THESE PEOPLE GET WHAT THEY NEED. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T RELEASED THE GUARDRAILS AGAIN. WELL AGAIN I'M GOING TO CLOSE THIS IS- I'VE BEEN A VERY FRUSTRATING- PERIOD OF TIME FOR PEOPLE IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. AS I SAID WE PROCESS THREE THOUSAND. IN OUR DISTRICT ALONE. AND YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARING. FROM US AND YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM OTHER MEMBERS AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM THE PUBLIC THE PROBLEMS ARE STILL THERE THE INNOCENT ONES WHO PLAY BY THE RULES ARE STILL GETTING HURT WE'RE STILL SEEING FRAUD WE'RE STILL SEEING DELAYS WE'RE STILL SEEING DEBIT CARDS. FROZEN THAT'S STATUS QUO HAS TO END IT HAS TO END NOW. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR PATTERSON- MISS CARILLO IS NEXT AND SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR BAKER AND THEN ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANDY VOEPEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- INTO THE BOTH CHAIRS WERE FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING AND HELLO TO TWO FIVE HELLO TO THOSE OF YOU AGAIN- FROM EDT THE DIRECTOR AND THE STAFF OR FOR AGAIN DOING THIS HEARING AND- IT SEEMS LIKE SEVERAL OF THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING ASKED HERE WERE ALSO ASKED AND BUDGET UP FOR. A JUST A ABOUT A WEEK OR SO AGO TIME KIND OF. BLENDON ALTOGETHER BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING A CMMENT THAT MISS SIGNS MADE EARLIER TODAY- REGARDING LEADERSHIP AT EIGHTY. SO I'M I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW MANY. DEPUTY DIRECTORS OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. HAS THE DEPARTMENT HAD IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. GREAT QUESTION OF CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. ALL I THINK WE HAVE LOST THREE. TWENTY TWENTY WELL ABOUT THAT. THAT'S CURRENT THANK YOU. WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FOR OF YOU WANT TO DO DIRECTORS OVER THE LAST. THE CURRENT VACANCY. SO THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR DEPUTY DIRECTORS OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. I WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR IS THAT ACCURATE- I'M SORRY I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASKING SOLELY ABOUT THE U. Y. MANAGERS SO- I THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE DIRECTORS OF THE E. D. MY WRONG NO I WAS ASKING ABOUT YOU I DIRECTORS. SPECIFIC OKAY ARE. NOT YES BOB WHO IS THE CURRENT DIRECTOR OF YOU I. IS VACANT HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN BAY WE HAVE. A WEEK. WEEK TWO WEEKS A WEEK TWO WEEKS AND WE HAVE A THREE NEED. HI FOLKS WHO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DOWN THERE. THERE ARE STILL TAKING LEADERSHIP RIGHT NOW. HOW LONG WAS THE PERSON ACTING AS THE U. R. DIRECTOR IN THE POSITION. NO THE DIRECTOR THAT JUST LEFT WAS- IN THE POSITION FOR THREE MONTHS. OKAY AND THEN WE HAVE NOW THERE THE OTHERS ARE IN- ACTING ROLE. TO FILL THAT SPOT I AM I'M ASKING BECAUSE IT'S INCREDIBLY INCONSISTENT TO ME RIGHT TO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND I CAN SEE HOW. HOW IS THE DEPARTMENT OF NOT HAVING CONSISTENT LEADERSHIP. IS AN INCREDIBLE CHALLENGE AS ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC IT WAS ALREADY A CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT BUT EVEN MORE SO NOW. AND NOW WITH THE SECRETARY OF LABOR ALSO LEAVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND JOINING THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN UNDERSECRETARY'S POSITION WHO HAS NOT BEEN FILLED IN OVER A YEAR WHO IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE. AND TAKING ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT WE ARE AND. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. I AM THE PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. AND I AM THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. I APPRECIATE THAT DIRECTOR SIGNS AND YOU COMING IN AND TAKING OWNERSHIP OF THE POSITION BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- AND REALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT THE INCONSISTENCY IN LEADERSHIP- ADNAN D. D. HAS LED US. TO THIS INCREDIBLE PROBLEMS AFFECTING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE AGENCY- AND INABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND THEN ABILITY TO CREATING SYSTEMS AND AN ABILITY TO HEED THE ADVICE GIVEN IN TERMS OF- THE YEARS OF NEGLECT WITHIN A TECHNOLOGY AND A DEPARTMENT THAT. FAILS TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS. IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM IT IS A PROFIT IN A CONSISTENT ISSUE WITH LACK OF MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP- ALL THE ALL THE WAY ACROSS. CAN YOU TELL US- WHEN THE NEW EDT- SYSTEM WILL BE UP. NOT IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. THE PROCESS OF STANDING UP THE NEW SYSTEM IS HIGHLY. OF INTENSIVE REQUIRES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU ARE AND THEN I. T. B. TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR CURRENT RESPONSIBILITIES. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BUSINESS PROCESSES. AND TO REVIEW THE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO GET THE JOB BEFORE IT'S DONE. THESE ARE THE ISSUE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE SOMETHING THAT. WE WILL LOOK AT MORE CLOSELY WHEN WE START UP THE BSM SYSTEM AGAIN YES I'M PROJECT AGAIN. A LOCAL REQUIRE- AND ANYONE WHO DEALS WITH TECHNOLOGY- HAS APPRECIATION FOR THIS. YOU REALLY HAVE TO PULL PEOPLE OUT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HAVE THEM OUTSIDE THE BUSINESS PROCESSES AND WHAT BUSINESS PROCESSES COULD BE IMPROVED AND WHAT DIRECTION IN ADDITION TO THE I. T. PEOPLE COLLUDING WITH THE VENDOR TO DEVELOP IN THE SYSTEM. IS THERE AN ADDITIONAL SYSTEM THAT'S BEING CREATED THAT'S SPECIFIC TO P. YOU ARE SORRY POS. NO ALL DIRECTOR SIGNED BY I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO POINT THIS OUT TO YOU BUT- LABOR SECRETARY JULIE SUE WAS IN A TOWN HALL JUST RECENTLY WITH SENATOR HENRY STERN WHERE ACTUALLY I'M I'M READING AND FOLLOWING HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT WHERE HE SAID SPECIFICALLY UPDATE P. UA UNEMPLOYMENT OF MONEY TIMELINE FOLLOWING YESTERDAY'S TOWN HALL LABOR SECRETARY JULIE SU SAYS NEW EDT SYSTEM WILL DELIVER P. WAY PAYMENT IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS UPON APPLICATION THE NEW PLATFORM WILL BE UP IN TWO WEEKS BENEFITS WILL DATE BACK TO THE FIRST WEEK OF FEBRUARY. R. O. OKAY THAT'S VERY EASILY EXPLAINABLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE UPDATE USING MODULES THAT ADDRESS A PARTICULAR- ISSUE LIKE THE P. WHERE'S YOUR PRODUCT. SO I PUT IN MY MIND THE SYSTEM IS A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF BASIC PLATFORM SO MY MISTAKE I WAS ARE MISINTERPRETED WHAT YOU SAID. THAT LAST WEEK WE HAVE WE ARE REGULARLY ADDING MODULES TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND THOSE ARE UPDATES. OKAY I THINK PART OF THE- THE SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP TO INFORMATION. AND THESE HEARINGS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE SO WHEN LEGISLATORS ARE ASKING ARE FRUSTRATED ABOUT SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS NOT WORKING AND- BEING REFERRED BACK TO OFFICES OF THE LEGISLATURE ACROSS THE STATE WE DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEMS WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE SO WHAT WE WANNA DO IS. BE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE CHANGES THE CHANGES THAT YOU ARE IMPLEMENTING BECAUSE ON ONE POINT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME. YET THERE ARE CHANGES TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW. TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. AS A PART OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY PROCESS IS ACTUALLY LETTING US KNOW WHAT ARE THE CHANGES. THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN SILO WITH ONE MEMBER OF EITHER HOUSE WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE A TOWN HALL. WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS. SO IN IN THE HEARING THAT WE HAD LAST WEEK THAT I CHAIRED A BUDGET SUB FLOOR. WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT ANY NEW INFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE. AND I WOULD LIKE IT'S NOT UNHEARD. I GOT IS NOT A REASONABLE REQUEST WELL I WOULD LIKE A CONFIRMATION FROM YOU AS TO WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CAN EXPECT. DIRECT COMMUNICATION FROM YOUR OFFICE TO EACH OF OUR OFFICE SO THAT WE'RE NOT FINDING INFORMATION VIA TWITTER. I UNDERSTAND SAY AND- WE ARE ALREADY. THROUGH THE MICHIGAN SO WE'RE HAVING TO BUY WEEKLY MEETINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING. I THINK WE PROBABLY GET TO WEEKLY MEETINGS KEVIN. BERMAN THOSE WITH. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS WE MY UNDERSTANDING A LOT OF INFORMATION IS GOING TO YOUR STAFF. AND IF THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. PLEASE LET US KNOW AND WE'LL CHANGE THAT- BUT OUR WATER BAR INFORMATION DOESN'T GO OUT TO THE LEGISLATURE- SO. THAT'S NOT WORKING WILL IMPROVE IT. WELL I YOU KNOW I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION YOU'RE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY YOUR CONSTITUENTS WITH A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS- AND- OF. THE EXPECTED NUMBER HE WEIGHS MORE INTERESTING THE ACTUALLY ARE CONVEYED THAT TO. WIDELY BRIEFINGS AND IN WRITING SO- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BREAKDOWN IS BUT WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. OKAY IF I MAY UM I THINK THERE BE A LITTLE CONFUSED GOING ON ANOTHER SEPARATE PERFORMED ON. HAULS MARCH APRIL AND MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY. I THINK THIS WILL BE COMING FROM POSTPONED. APRIL TWENTY TWENTY IN WHICH- WE WERE ANNOUNCING. THE LAUNCH OF THE- PROGRAM. IT WOULD BE ON. ET DEC I'LL SO IT- SO THIS I DON'T THINK THIS IS A NEW. OUR HOST THAT WE'RE REFERRING SO JUST WONDERING. MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLEAR I MEAN HAVE OF COURSE IT IS OUR INTENTION TO SHARE- UPDATES OR RELEASES OF THE LEGISLATURE IN. A PLAN TO DO SO. I JUST ONE. I'M SURE THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF A BREAK OUT I KNOW IT'S VERY INTERESTING- NEVER SECRETARY STUDENT. WE CONVEY THIS INFORMATION. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT WENT WRONG THERE. AND WHAT IS WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATION IN TERMS OF WHEN WILL SOMEONE BE HIRED TO TAKE ON THE NEW POSITION OF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF YOU I. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF RECRUITING RIGHT NOW. SO AS A- CAROL INDICATED SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE. OUR THREE PEOPLE WHO ARE ROTATING THE RESPONSIBILITY AS WE SPEAK. AND MY APOLOGIESTHAT THE TWEET IS- FROM APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND SO THERE IS THERE ARE WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS STILL THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL RECEIVE UPDATED INFORMATION IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY YOU'RE CHANGING SYSTEMS ENOUGH DURING THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE NEW IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM THAT ARE CURRENTLY. IN THE PROCESS THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT FOR US TO KNOW INCLUDING LANGUAGE COMPETENCY- IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW FOR INFORMATION THAT FOLKS ARE ABLE TO GET ONLINE SO CALL CENTER INFORMATION RESOURCES TO THE CALL CENTER- LANGUAGE BARRIERS AT CETERA. HELLO WORLD AND GIVEN AND GIVEN THE CHANGING OF THE CONSTANT CHANGING OF LEADERSHIP- DIRECTOR SIGNS I'M I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE COMMITMENT YOU'VE EXPRESSED IT SEVERAL TIMES- IN SEVERAL HEARINGS STEALING YOUR STUFF- AND SO I KNOW THAT WE ARE IN A PLACE OF HAVING TO MOVE FORWARD AND FIND SOLUTIONS. FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE WILL THE STATE IS IN A INTERESTING POSITION AND THAT IT HAS NOT REPLACED THE UNDERSECRETARY OF LABOR IT WILL SOON BE ON THE SEARCH FOR A NEW SECRETARY OF LABOR. YOU ARE NEW TO YOUR POSITION THERE CURRENTLY IS NO ONE- IN THE POSITION OF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND SO IT'S IT LEAVES US ALL IN A- KIND OF AN IN THE DARKNESS. AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE SENATOR SUPPORT YET THESE POSITIONS. ARE VACANT. AND SO HOW CAN WE OUR JOBS. WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE AND PLACES OR PEOPLE WILL SOON BE. MOVING ON. TO ACTUALLY FIX THIS PROBLEM TO THE QUESTION ON MY COLLEAGUES WERE WERE ASKING EARLIER ABOUT THE CONTRACT BETWEEN EDT AND BANK OF AMERICA. THAT CONTRACT IS SADLY NOT AVAILABLE ONLINE BUT HOW AYE BUT WHAT I SAID IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO SAY. THAT CONTRACT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. IT IS NOT A SECRET DOCUMENT. IT IS NOT TO BE HIDDEN AWAY IT IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT. AND SO I MOVED CAN WE HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM YOU TO MAKE THAT DOCUMENT AVAILABLE ONLINE. R.

I WAS CALLING PEOPLE RATHER THAN THAT CALLING THIS WAS PROVIDING SELF SERVICE OPTIONS EVERY YOU BACKGROUND IN TECHNO- YOU. ALL OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE GETTING ALL THESE CALLS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE CANNOT COULD NOT. TAKE CARE OF THIS ONE OF THE- YEAH EXACTLY SO EXACT SO THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THOUSAND PEOPLE X. RAY. THREE TO FOUR MILLION CALLS. GOING TO WORK IT CAN'T MAKE A CALL SO THAT. WHAT YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO LOOK OTHER OPTIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE SERVE.

FULL SCOPE OF THE CLAIM WE'RE HAVING TO MAKE OUTBOUND CALLS TO CLIENTS REGARDING THEIR ACCOUNT WHEN WE SEE THAT IT'S THAT IT'S IN A STOCK OR A STATUS THAT HAS NOT BEEN PENDING STATUS WITH A NEXT ACTION. IS ON THE CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM IT HAS TO TAKE ACTION TO MOVE BACK WHAT WE'RE WE'RE MAKING THOSE PHONE CALLS TO ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET THE- BIG BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE SEEKING. M. ALSO DURING THAT CONVERSATION WERE ABLE TO EXTRACT IF THEY'RE IF. THEY WANT TO ABANDON THEIR CLAIM AND THEN YOU KNOW IT CAN TAKE IT OFF THE FILE BUT THOSE ARE THE NEXT ACTIONS UPSET WAS A LOT FOR YOU NEED TO DO BUT WE- DOUBT THIS APPROACH TO BENEFIT CLAIMANTS TO BE MORE PROACTIVE WITH THEM ONCE THEY DON'T HAVE. TO CALL INTO WE CAN GIVE THEM EDUCATION THAT'S MORE WITHOUT REACHING EDUCATION. FOR THEM REGARDING THE STATUS OF THE CALL. OKAY GOT THANK YOU. THANK CENTER TO REMOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOPE JUST LOCAL POLICE. MISTER CORRECTOR. I WOULD LIKE TO- SIMPLY SAY. THAT I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES SAY PROSTRATIONS MINE. CONSTITUENTS HAVE SUFFERED THE SAME ON DISASTER NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT FOR A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THIS CRISIS WILL PASS THEY ALWAYS DO. BUT IN THE FUTURE WILL HAVE. MORE AND DIFFERENT CRISES WHETHER IT'S A BIOLOGICAL- EVENT FOR A RECESSION OR DEPRESSION. AND YOU WILL HAVE SURGEONS OF CLAIMS. SO I SUGGEST YOU MAY WANT TO EXPLORE A RESOURCE THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF- I SPENT THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AT A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF YOU MAY WANT TO EXPLORE USING INSURANCE COMPANIES AS A BACK UP THE MILITARY HAS RESERVES I CAN CALL UP DURING EMERGENCIES OR WAR THEY CAN CALL UP THE RESERVES. NATIONAL GUARD YOU MAY WANT TO HAVE A READY RESERVE. IF THIS TYPE OF EVENT HAPPENS AGAIN CONCERNS COMPANIES HAVE. THEY HANDLED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CLAIMS A YEAR ACROSS ALL THE LINES AND THERE'S A SAYING IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT CLAIMS IS CLAIMS. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT LINES AS THERE WOULD BE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EDIE DECLINES BUT THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE CUTTING EDGE I. T. THEY CAN TURN ON A DIME. MASSIVE CALL CENTERS WITH HIGHLY TRAINED VERY DEDICATED PEOPLE. SO YOU MAY WANT TO DO IN THE FUTURE A PILOT PROGRAM WITH SONIC AREA. CROSSED THREE IN HAVE A POTENTIAL RESERVE TO HELP YOU OUT THE NEXT TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS ON IN I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WOULD BE VERY OPEN TO IT NOT JUST TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK. BUT TO DO A COMMUNITY SERVICE HELP YOU OUT. AND IT ALSO HELPS THE HELP THE ROMAN PLEASE BECAUSE DURING TIMES LIKE THIS THEY HAVE LAYOFFS AS WELL SO THAT'S MY COMMENT- HOPEFULLY YOU MIGHT WANT TO PURSUE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGESTION. THANK YOU MR VOEPEL. AND WE ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS- LET ME GO AHEAD AND JUST ASK FOR CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I KNOW THIS WAS DRESSED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. AND THIS WAS- IN REGARDS TO. THOSE CLAIMANTS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE DONE EVERYTHING. I WANT TO SAY THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING ASKED OF THEM BY EDT. BUT NOW WE'RE HEARING CONCERNING CASES WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT BE PENALIZED ARE ASKED TO GIVE SOME OF THE- MONEY BACK TO EDT THAT THEY WERE. THAT THERE I GUESS HE DID HE WOULD CLAIM THEY WEREN'T ENTITLED TO COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO US- THE PLAN IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH THOSE SITUATIONS PLEASE. THERE ARE. HI CAROL WILLIAMS. SO WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A TASK FORCE AND NOTE THAT WE GET YOU TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO YET BUT I DO APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN- THE MAGNITUDE AS YOU UNDERSTAND THE OF THIS DELAYED WORK IN THIS TASK FORCE IS LOOKING AT STREAMLINING TO DETERMINATION PROCESS WITH CONSIDERATION FOR EQUITY AND GOOD CONSCIENCE ALONG FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED UNDER BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL ALSO LET ME EXPLAIN THAT JUST ANOTHER LEVEL THE CONTINUED ASSISTANCE FOR THE UNEMPLOYMENT UNEMPLOYED WORKERS AFTER TWENTY TWENTY IT DOESN'T ALLOW STATES TO WAIVE OVER PAYMENTS NOT ONLY FOR POOL BUT FOR THE ELDERLY WOULD LOST WAGES SYSTEMS PROGRAM. THE LANGUAGE IN THE ACT ALLOWS- UNDER TWO CATEGORIES. FOR BOTH PROGRAMS ONE. IF PAYMENT WAS MADE FULL OF THE- INTO IF THE REPAYMENT WOULD BE THEY CALLED CONTRARY TO EQUITY AND GOOD CONSCIENCE WHICH IS THE FINANCIAL ABILITY OF A PERSON AND MORE ANXIOUS FOR ADDITIONAL LABOR GUIDELINES AS WELL AS ALL THE STATE'S ON THE WHOLE EQUITY AND GOOD CONSCIENCE BUT WE'RE STANDING AT THE READY TO UNDERSTAND THESE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS THAT WILL HELP US TO. PROVIDE THESE WAIVERS- NOT NECESSARILY A BLANKET APPROACH BUT IF WE COULD WE WOULD- BUT CERTAINLY AS IT APPLIES TO CLAIM IT SO THIS IS HOW WE'RE LOOKING TO UNDERSTAND THE PROVISIONS AND APPLY IT TO THE THIS GROUP OF- BASICALLY. THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DELAYED FROM LAST SPRING HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. NOAH DOES I JUST WANNA. THE JUST THE FOLLOWING QUESTION WOULD BE. WHEN YOU NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS. ADDITIONALLY WILL THEY BE INFORMED- THIS WAIVER PROCESS. IF AN OVERPAYMENT- IS SENT THESE ARE ALL RIGHT SO IT ABSOLUTELY WOULD BE INCLUDED- IN THAT NOTIFICATION WE'RE HOPING TO MAYBE UNDERSTAND THE COLD WAR EVEN BEFORE THEN BUT EVEN GOING TO LET THE TASK FORCE TAKE A LOOK AT THE COHORTS BIG. GROUPS OF THEM AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO ON TO SCALE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO CLAIMS BUT WE DO REACH OUT TO THE THEM THESE OVERPAYMENTS ARE ISSUE THEY'LL HAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION ON AND THEY NEED TO THEN CIRCLE BACK WITH US AND SELF CERTIFY YOU KNOW ELIGIBILITY FOR WAIVER. THAT MAKES SENSE KEVIN ANYTHING ELSE BUT GET BETTER. IT'S KERN. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND I THINK- AS YOU WERE DOING YOUR UPDATES WITH THE LEGISLATORS WITH YOUR- UPDATED MEETINGS THAT MAYBE YOU INCLUDED THAT IN THERE BECAUSE I AM SURE OUR OFFICES WILL BE. FLOODED WITH CALLS ONCE THAT STARTS- BECOMING MORE PROMINENT I JUST HEARD THE DIGITAL. VERY SIMILAR QUESTION BUT ARE WE ALSO DOING JUST THE SAME TYPE OF PROCESS WE CAN EXPECT FOR THE TAX FORM THE TEN NINETY NINE G. WHEN THOSE GO OUT TO INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE OF REFUGEES- FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS OF A FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. THEY'RE MISTAKENLY ON THE- MISTAKENLY RECEIVING- ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT THEY NEVER RECEIVED. WE HAVE THE SAME PROCESS YES. THE CRIMINAL WE WILL EDUCATE PEOPLE WHEN WE NOTIFY THEM WHEN THEY CONTACT US. PLEASE EXPLAIN. KEVIN I THINK- IT WOULD BEHOOVE EDT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TURN AROUND TIME- ON THOSE WOULD BE FAIRLY QUICKLY AS PEOPLE SEE A FORM. HOW WOULD THEY BE TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND YOU KNOW AS THE SOONER YOU CAN GET THAT ADDRESS THE SOONER YOU RELIEVE A LOT OF ANXIETY FOR CALIFORNIANS.
