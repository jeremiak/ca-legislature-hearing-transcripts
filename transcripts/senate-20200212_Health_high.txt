ON HEALTH- ON THE RISE AND EIGHTEEN HEALTH IMPACTS REDUCING USE I WELCOME EVERYONE HERE- VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE- TESTIMONY AROUND- WHAT'S GOING ON IN SHAPING ANDSO I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT. INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO. PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- IS YOU KNOW THE NATION HAS EXPERIENCED AN ALARMING HEALTH OUTBREAK RELATING TO VAPING PRODUCTS I WHICH IS CALLED THE OF ALI OUTBREAK E. A. B. A. R. T. V. A. L. I. OUTBREAK. AND WELL PERHAPS BEING OVERSHADOWED BY CORONA VIRUS AND- THE FLUTE AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR SHOULD RECOGNIZE YOUR BEEN ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SIXTY CONFIRMED DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES- WITH MORE THAT'S BEING INVESTIGATED POLLUTION TO THIS OUTBREAK AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD TWO HUNDRED FIVE HOSPITALIZATIONS WITH THIRTY COUNTIES REPORTING CASES AND FOUR. CONFIRMED DEATHS THE CDC NOW REPORTS THAT THERE'S BEEN US THAT THERE IS A STRONG LINK BETWEEN THE VALLEY OUTBREAK AND BLACK MARKET CANNABIS BEEPING PRODUCTS CONTAIN. VITAMIN D. ACETATE AS AN ADDITIVE- BUT BOTH THE CCM TO THE PAR PUBLIC HEALTH CONTINUE TO CAUTION ABOUT THE USE OF ANY VAPING PRODUCTS PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUTH YOUNG ADULTS PREGNANT WOMEN ADULTS WHO'VE NEVER USE FADING PRODUCTS. AND WILL CERTAINLY THE BLACK MARKET- CANNABIS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN REYES A HOST OF OTHER ISSUES THIS HEARING WILL FOCUS MAINLY ON TOBACCO BASED DATING PRODUCTS. NOW THE RECENT NAY USED TO BE SERVE CONDUCT BY THE SEA. AND FDA THAT THE AMONG USE CONTINUES TO RISE. AND REPORTS IN TWENTY NINETEEN MORE THAN FIVE MILLION USE USE THE CIGARETTES UP FROM NEARLY THREE POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THINK ABOUT THAT THREE POINT SIX TO FIVE MILLION IN THE YEAR. TWENTY SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTER VAPING UP FROM EIGHT PERCENT. TEN POINT UP FROM FOUR POINT 3% AND TWENTY SIXTEEN CELEBRATE DRAMATIC RISE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE MARKETING OF FLAVOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN ATTRACTING USE TO VAPING AND THOSE NUMBERS CONCERTS FIRM THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD IN RAISING THE MINIMUM AGE TO PURCHASE TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO TWENTY ONE AND THE FDA ALSO ISSUED A TEMPORARY BAN ON MOST FLEETING. FLAVORED BAKING PRODUCTS UNTIL MANUFACTURES CAN SHOW THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE. AND CERTAINLY THE RISING YOU TO USE AN ACCESS OF ANY CONCERN FOR MANY YEARS. AND THE NUMBERS THAT I. QUOTED PROVIDE PROOF THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TAKE BOLD STEPS BEYOND JUST WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE. I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WAS CERTAINLY- UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED THAT VAPING AS X. GOKUL SAFER ALTERNATIVES THEN. PERHAPS COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES THAT WE DO SEE THIS RISE IN USE WHO MANY WAYS IS THE FIRST INTRODUCTION TO NICOTINE. AND NICOTINE WHETHER IT'S AN OF A PRODUCT OR IN A COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE IS AN ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE ONE THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE INTRODUCING ARE USED TO WE KNOW THAT STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT- IF YOU GET. DISPOSED TO NICOTINE- THROUGH VAPING YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO THEN MOVE ON TO COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- UNFORTUNATELY- WELL. THE AP HAS BEEN TOUTED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES AND MAYBE- BUT NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW. NO VAPING PRODUCTS HAS BEEN. FORMALLY SUBMITTED TO THE FDA FOR USE AS A SMOKING CESSATION- DEVICE SO- I THINK THAT'S IT THE FACT THAT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET- I THINK THOSE RAISE SOME ISSUES ABOUT. ANY SORT OF CLAIMS THAT THIS IS A THIS IS AN ALTERNATIVE OR WAIT SORTS SMOKE CESSATION WELL CERTAINLY WE DO WANT TO PROMOTE- WAYS TO GET PEOPLE OFF TO BACK BOTH TOGETHER AND PARTICULARLY NEXT. SO I'M LOOKING THE CONVERSATION TODAY AM. PLEASED TO WELCOME CENTER HELLO. WELL NOW NOW THIS CAN SOMEONE COME INTEREST IN. THIS ISSUE SO TO JOIN US TODAY THANK YOU THREE SIR HELL. AND SO WITH THAT LIKE TO ASK FOR ASK ALSO CENTER LEAVE IT IS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OR DO YOU HAD. IT FOR DO YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME. REMARKS YEAH OKAY. HILL THANK YOU CHAIR IN IN IN THANK YOU FOR HOLDING HEARING IN. YOU FOR LEADERSHIP YOUR- LEADERS ON THIS SUBJECT I IT'S INCREDIBLE AND- FRANKLY WE WERE WINNING THE WAR. YEAH WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL ADULTS SMOKING HAD. IS DROPPED. AND YOUTH SMOKING HAS CONTINUOUSLY GOING DOWN WITH THE STAKE ACTED ALL IN FORTUNATE EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE. BUT AS YOU MENTIONED WITH OVER FIVE MILLION KIDS NOW USING E. CIGARETTES. YOUTH TOBACCO CONSUMPTION HAS- ASSUME UNPRECEDENTED SURGE- IT AND IT'S TROUBLING IS TROUBLING TO ME AND I THINK TO MOST OF US BUT IT'S NOT SURPRISING. BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ALSO IS IT THE VAPING INDUSTRY IS COPIED THE BIG TOBACCO PLAYBOOK. LAUREN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WITH PERVASIVE MARKETING FALSE PROMISES AND REALLY THIS KID FRIENDLY FLAVORS SO. THEY SAY E. CIGARETTES ARE SAFE AND SMOKE AS A GOOD SMOKING ALTERNATIVE BUT AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED- NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN APPROVED AS A SMOKING CESSATION PRODUCT. OR SOMETHING THAT CAN HAVE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DEBUNKED IN EVERY DAY MORE EVIDENCE EMERGES TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE SO. THERE'S AN URGENT NEED. FOR THIS LEGISLATOR TO LEGISLATURE TO TAKE STRONG AND MEANING MEANINGFUL ACTION TO DISRUPT THIS EPIDEMIC THAT WERE SEEN SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. AM EAGER AND REALLY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS CRISIS SO THAT WE CAN FIGHT IT HEAD ON SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN. Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT SO LET'S GO AND HEAD AND BRING UP FOR- FIRST SPEAKER- PLEASE INVITE. BY DR MICHAEL ON- FROM THE- IS PROFESSOR RESIDENTS OF MEDICINE HEALTH POLICY OVER AT AND MANAGEMENT AT UCLA- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND LOOKING FOR DURING YOUR PRESENTATION WELCOME. SENATE AND I'LL GET SOMEONE ELSE'S. THANK YOU SENATORS UP FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MICHAEL ôNG AND THE PRACTICING PHYSICIAN AND PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH AT UCLA I ALSO IN THE CHAIR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BACK ON EDUCATION RESEARCH OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE- ALSO KNOWN AS T. ROCK AND SO WHILE IM NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF T. ROCK TODAY I'M HAPPY TO REITERATE MANY OF THE- POINTS THAT- T. ROCK HAS ALREADY ENDORSED THAT RELATE TO BE PAYING- AND JOB OTHER FLAVORED PRODUCTS. I THINK THAT IT'S CRITICAL TO- THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS ARE YOU THREE USING AND SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE TO SCHOOL TOBACCO SURVEY- OVER 85% OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO USE THE TOBACCO PRODUCT IN THE PAST THIRTY DAYS USED A FLAVOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND SOME OF MEMBERS ARE SPECIFICALLY SEEN WITH FLAVORED ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES. FOR THE MOST PART YOU THEY'RE NOT USING TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES ANYMORE THEY'RE USING ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES OR COMMON KNOWN AS THE CIGARETTE VAPING DEVICES AND SO IF THE FROM THAT SURVEY ALONE AROUND 11% OF- TWELVE SO IF THAT TWELVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT- 11% ARE USING ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES AND IT'S REALLY ONLY 2% PREVALENCE FOR TRADITIONAL CIGARETTE. SO I'M FROM ROCKSTAND. WE DO RIGHT PROHIBITING FLAVOR TOBACCO. IN THAT'S WITHOUT EXAM. FORCED FLAVORS RETAIL LOCATIONS WERE PRODUCT TYPE- INSULT AS A YOU HEARD ALREADY FAVOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE PARTICULARLY APPEALING FOR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS TO BEGIN USING TOBACCO. AND DUE TO THE CURRENT LACK OF REGULATION AS YOU ALREADY MENTIONED- VERY FEW THE FLAVORING CHEMICALS IN ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES HAVE UNDERGONE ADEQUATE TOXICITY OR SEATING TESTING FOR. OUR SAFETY TESTING FOR ACUTE OR CHRONIC INHALATION. A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY THE RECENT E. CIGARETTE AND VAPING ASSOCIATED LONG INJURY CASES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SHE WROTE PREGNANT PROHIBITING ALL FLAVORS INCLUDING MEANT AND MENTAL. MENTAL MASKS THE HARSH TASTE OF TOBACCO AND MAKES THE SMOKE EASIER TO INHALE AND IT'S AND THAT'S HOUSING AFFECT MAKE IT EASIER AND MORE APPEALING TO USERS PARTICULARLY USED TO START USING TOBACCO. SPECIFIC POPULATIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN THE TARGETS OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY MARKETING TO INCREASE THEIR USE OF MENTHOL CIGARETTES AND OTHER PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LGBT Q. COMMUNITIES. MEANT ALONG WITH WRITTEN MANGO HAVE BEEN THE TOP FLAVORS FOR YOUNG JEWEL USERS IT I LAST YEAR WITH NEARLY A THIRD OF- EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD JEWEL USERS USING MEANT THE LAST TIME THE FATE. KID ROCK ALSO RECOMMENDS PROHIBITING THE SALE OF FAVOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN ALL STORES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN- OVER 30% OF INSPECTED TALKED ABOUT THE STORES AND SMOKE SHOPS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH SHOULD BE LIMITED TO ADULTS ONLY SOLD TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO UT CHORUS WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT- SALES TO. THOSE UNDER TWENTY ONE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO RESTRICT THESE PRODUCTS- IN TERMS OF THEIR AVAILABILITY. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACT COMPREHENSIVELY IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL ACTION WEEK WHICH EXEMPTED CERTAIN FAVORITE PRODUCTS AT ADDICTED YOUTH THAT ARE SO- THAT- YOU THIRD NOW SWITCHING TOWARD SUCH AS DISPOSABLE E. CIGARETTES AND TANK BASED SYSTEMS. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION WHILE THEY DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THESE PRODUCTS THEY HAVE YET TO START EVALUATING ANY THESE PRODUCTS ON SAFETY- THAT SHOULD HAPPEN LATER THIS YEAR. BUT POTENTIALLY THEY MAY LOSE THEIR OVERSIGHT OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS IS. LISTED IN THE CURRENT- BUDGET- THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SOME CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES OF ALSO EXEMPTED TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICALLY DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOOKAH PRODUCTS. FROM FLAVOR REGULATION AND SO I JUST TO CLARIFY THE HARMS FROM HOOKAH PRODUCTS. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS DETERMINED THAT- ONE HOUR OF HOOKAH SMOKING IS EQUIVALENT TO SMOKING OVER A HUNDRED CIGARETTES. CALIFORNIA HAD BEEN MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS IN REDUCING HIGH SCHOOL AGE YOUTH TOBACCO USE. BRING IT DOWN FROM TWENTY TWO POINT 1% IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETY TWO THOUSAND AND TEN DOWN TO TWELVE POINT TWO IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE HAVE MADE A TON OF PROGRESS- THAT BEING SAID IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT RATE WAS AT TWELVE POINT 7% WE'VE REALLY TAKEN A STEP BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF WORKING ON YOUTH TOBACCO USE RATES AND SO. IT IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ACTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM IN CENTER HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF A GLITCH IN THE- DO IS IT. OR ARE THE FLAVORS WHAT IS THE ATTRACTIVE NATURE OF THE E. CIGARETTE TO THEM OR IS IT THE- THIS SECTION IS OF SOME OF THOSE PRODUCTS THE DISPENSING DEVICES. I THINK THAT IT IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH AND I THINK THAT THAT IS WHAT FUELED THE RISE OF PRODUCTS LIKE JEWEL WHICH WERE- LOOKS JUST LIKE A STANDARD USB DEVICE THAT- MOST A SCHOOL- TEACHERS- AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN SCHOOLS. HAD NO IDEA WHAT THESE WERE A SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO I DO THINK THAT- THE KINDS OF DEVICES ARE ONE THING BUT IT IT'S THE FLAVORS AT ALSO REALLY ATTRACT INDIVIDUALS TO IT BECAUSE IF IT REALLY TASTED LIKE TOBACCO I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD REALLY BE USING THOSE PRODUCTS AND THAT'S I THINK THE MAIN REASON WHY YOU SEE. MOST YOUTH USING FLAVORED ALEX RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT- DISPLAY FOR LIKE TOBACCO. IN IF I COULD FOLLOW UP WITH ANOTHER QUESTION FUTURE THE- THE- HE WOULD TALK ABOUT WE ASSUME THAT NICOTINE IS. A PROBLEM IN THE ADDICTION IS A PROBLEM WE KNOW WHAT THE EFFECTS KßT LONG TERM CAN BE WITH TOBACCO SMOKING BUT- WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF. NICOTINE ADDICTION TO A YOUNG PERSON WHEN THEY'RE NOT SMOKING A CIGARETTE AND ADDICTED TO THE NICOTINE COMING FROM OF A PIN DEVICE. SO ARMY WE OF OFTEN- HAD A LOT OF DEBATES- YOU SINCE- THE- RISE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AS TO THE RELATIVE SAFETY OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SO- FOR EXAMPLE MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICES ESTIMATE. QUITE AWHILE AGO THAT SAID THAT- THESE PRODUCTS ARE 95% SAFER THAN. TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES. I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO REALLY SAY THAT WAS BASED ON A LOT OF CONJECTURE ON DEVICES THAT WERE PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR GENERATIONS AGO- IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THESE. PRODUCTS NOW- IN PARTICULARLY SOMETHING LIKE THE JEWEL WHICH- HAVE VERY CONCENTRATED FORMS OF NICOTINE LIKE NICOTINE SALTS- ONE OF THE- COUPONS IS EQUAL TO. THE SAME AMOUNT OF NICOTINE THAT YOU WOULD GET IN A PACK OF CIGARETTES A TWENTY CIGARETTES. AND I SEE KIDS OR HEAR ABOUT KIDS BETTER USING COMPUTER FOR JEWEL PODS. NOW AS THE INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN- WE ICE I WORK WITH A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN HEAVY SMOKERS BEFORE. USUALLY THERE AT ONE OR TWO PACKS A DAY THAT'S CONSIDERED HEAVY SMOKING AND SO THE AMOUNT OF NICOTINE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING NOW IS TREMENDOUS- NICOTINE ITSELF- HAS AN LD FIFTY NUMBER WHICH MEANS THAT IT. IS A LEGAL- KIND OF COMPOUND WHEN GIVEN AT HIGH LEVELS AND SO. ON PARTICULARLY WHEN THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS WERE FIRST MADE AVAILABLE WHEN THE FOR FREE FORM- WITH LITTLE REGULATION BE WE WOULD HEAR ABOUT POISON CONTROL CENTER CALLS GOING UP WITH THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS SO. I THINK THAT WITH NICOTINE ITSELF COME WHEN IT'S INHALED. IN A WHILE EVEN WHILE THESE PRODUCTS MAY NOT NECESSARILY. BE BURNING MATERIALS THAT WOULD HAVE CARCINOGENIC COMPOUNDS AS MUCH AS WE WOULD SEE FROM OTHER TYPE OF PRODUCTS. NICOTINE AFFECTS MANY DIFFERENT. ORGANS IN THE SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT IT HAS A LOT OF CARDIO VASCULAR EX. IT'S ALSO GOING TO THE FACTS ARE THE DEVELOPING BRAIN AS WELL SO THINK THAT. THEY'RE NOT. GOING TO CONSIDER IT WOULD. THAT BE THREE USE THIS FOR. SENATE THINK STRUCTURE. DR ON THANK YOU FOR BE HERE WITH. TODAY SO WE HEAR FOR. JEWEL AND THESE OTHER. THAT THIS IS A SUS. TO THE SOMEONE STOPS. AND GO TO VAPE. IN ORDER TO HELP THEM STOP SMOKING. I PERSONALLY I'M NOT A DOCTOR- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT RINGS TRUE WITH ME WHAT RINGS TRUE WITH ME IS THAT TOBACCO. USAGE WAS GOING DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY IS LOOKING FOR. A NEW WAY TO MAKE MONEY. AND THE FLAVORS ARE MARKETING DEVICE TO GET MORE CHILDREN HOPPED. SO THAT'S MY COMMENTARY MY QUESTION IS. DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY VALUE IN VAPING. TO BE USED AS A CESSATION DEVICE. I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT VAPING DEVICES COULD BE USED FOR CESSATION COMEDY HIT AT- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE KINDS OF PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE- THAT OUR FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVED FOR A TOBACCO CESSATION. WE DO USE NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND THERE IS A PRODUCT- HAT IS A NICOTINE INHALER THAT- AS DEVELOPED MANY YEARS AGO ON THAT IT'S NOT THAT DISSIMILAR TO A BEEPING DEVICE- THAT BEING SAID- IN TERMS OF ITS USE FOR CESSATION. HOW IT'S USED- IS GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL IN TERMS OF- HOW SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SET SUCCESSFULLY QUIT- AS SOMEBODY WHO DID SOME OF THE EARLY RESEARCH IN TERMS OF MAKING THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS OVER THE COUNTER WE ALL THOUGHT AT THAT POINT IN TIME THAT. MAKING NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY OVER THE COUNTER WOULD LEAD TO A LOT OF CESSATION AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN- EVEN THOUGH WE MAY LOTS OF PRODUCTIONS THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE. AND SO I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF TO HAVING TRUE CESSATON HAPPEN FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED A COORDINATED EFFORT IT CAN'T JUST BE FROM SOMEBODY BUYING IT FROM A BAIT SHOP- IMMEDIATE WE DO HERE MANY STORIES- FROM INDIVIDUALS WHOSE. SAY THAT THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO TRANSITION OFFICE CIGARETTES AND JUST BEEPING ONLY- YOU OFTEN DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT RELAPSE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE ONES ARE GOING TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT- AND SO I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF USING THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS. WELL THERE ARE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS ON THAT ARE NOT THE UNITED. THAT SHE NOT DEMONSTRATE INDIVIDUAL FOR A TO STOP USING TRADITIONAL CIGARETTE. ON THAT PARTICULAR STUDY THAT WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED IN NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE MOST PEOPLE CONTINUE TO STAY ON USING NICOTINE ITSELF SO THERE I'M NOT TRULY QUITTING ALL NICOTINE PRODUCTS. BUT THEY'RE CONTINUING TO USE THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS WHICH IN CALIFORNIA WE DEEM AS TOBACCO PRODUCTS. THE TREATING WANTED. FOR A IT'S THE ADDICTION IT IS THE NEW. IN OKAY SO THEY'RE JUST YOU KNOW CHANGING. PRODUCT FOR ANOTHER. I'M IN THAT THINGS WE DO A LOT OF. DO WILL. AS WELL- IN THE ADULT COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT THE OTHER CONCERN THAT WE DO HAVE IS FOR YOU TO ARE STARTING OFF USING NICOTINE PRODUCTS. LIKE VAPING PRODUCTS THAT THEY WILL EVENTUALLY TRANSITION TO OTHER TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT WILL HAVE MORE HARM SUCH AS TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES IN THE RIBBON. SEVERAL STUDIES. ON THAT BEEN DONE HERE IN THE US THAT HAVE LOOKED AT INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF THEIR TRANSITION FOLLOWING THEM OVER TIME AND SEEN THAT. THERE TRANSITION RATES ARE THREE TO FIVE TIMES HIGHER IN TERMS OF STARTING A TRADITIONAL CIGARETTE INITIATION AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TAPING. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS SO WITH AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- EIGHT. YEAH% I GUESS I WILL AND HE DID TOUCH ON MANY OF THE QUESTIONS- QUESTIONS I HAD ABOUT. NICOTINE ITSELF BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT- VAPING PRODUCT IS A NICOTINE PRODUCTS SO. ONE CAN ARGUE WHETHER IT'S BETTER OR WORSE THAN. COMBUSTION BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY. FINALLY GET OFF THE NICOTINE AND SOUNDS LIKE. YOU'RE TELLING ME THE ANSWER IS NO DATE FOR BY ME TO MAYBE. DEREK TOTAL EXAMPLES BUT- IN GENERAL WE'RE NOT SEEN THAT BASICALLY TO SWITCHING ONE PRODUCT FOR ANOTHER CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT I THINK THAT WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO MULTIPLE SUBSTANCES INCLUDING NICOTINE THEY WILL INVARIABLY TELL YOU THAT IT IS NOT THE CALL CAME. IT IS NOT THE HEROIN. IT IS THE NICOTINE THAT IS THE HARDEST THING FOR THEM TO QUIT. SO ME JUST- PERHAPS SPECULATE A LITTLE BIT HERE AND TELL ME WHETHER YOU GOT STRAIGHT SO WHAT SO THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT WHAT THE VAPING. WE HAVE USE. WHO MAY NOT HAVE SMOKE BEFORE WHO ATTRACTED TO A PRODUCTS PERHAPS THEN AND MADE EASIER TO BE INTRODUCED BECAUSE OF FLAVORS. BUT NOW THAT DAVIS TRIED IT AND I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS NICOTINE SOMETIMES IT DOES AS FAR HIGHER THAN THEY WOULD BE EXPOSED TO IN COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES. SO THEY WILL PROBABLY SIXTEEN GIVEN ITS ADDICTIVE QUALITIES WOULD YOU SAY IF WE SEE ELIMINATED TAPING THEY WOULD SIMPLY STOP RD WOULD THEN SEEK OUT ALTERNATIVE NICOTINE PRODUCTS LIKE COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES ARE EVEN BY THE WAY EVEN UNFLAVORED- VAPING PRODUCTS IF THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET FLAVORED VAPING PRODUCTS NOW THAT THERE ARE THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO NICOTINE AND BRAINS I THINK THAT THE- WE ARE SEEING THAT ALREADY- SO IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF THE CARTRIDGE BASED PRODUCTS ON THE REUSABLE WE DO- HERE ABOUT INDIVIDUALS FOR NOW SEEK OTHER TYPES OF. BECAUSE THEY ARE THE AN UNFORTUNATEBE I'M PARTICULARLY IN THE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE IN TERMS OF BEST WAYS TO GET PEOPLE TO QUIT THESE PRODUCTS A YOU SEE WHEN WE COME UP WITH- APPROACHES FOR CESSATION WE USUALLY WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE BEFORE WE THE EYES THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE A KILLER PRO I'M WHICHMEANS MY CONTROL TRYING TO RESEARCH WHICH IS DONE BY OTHER AT. MISSION ADULTS AT. LA MY COLLEAGUES WHO WERE THE OTHER KERRIER. THEY GET CALL ALL THE TIME THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP A AND WE DON'T HAVE A GRAY APPROACH INTO OF DOING THAT SO I. IT IS TRUE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL PROBABLY BE SEEKING OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE INTERIM I THINK THAT IT'LL BE REALLY CRITICAL FOR US TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS- ON WOMEN'S SELF OFFER THIS ADDICTION. AND AGAIN PART OF IT IS A RECOGNITION THAT THE ERROR ADDICTED TO MUCH HIGHER LEVELS THAN WE TRADITIONALLY I'VE EVER SEEN- FOR OTHER TYPES OF ADULTS. OKAY AND WOULD YOU. NUMBER I KNOW I'M FUTURE XIN AND YOU'RE NOT BUT PERHAPS YOU KNOW- IN TERMS OF- EXPOSURE AT THE AGES THAT THEY'RE BEING EXPOSED TO SO WE SEE PEOPLE STARTING BE PAYING NOT ONLY LATE. TEENS EARLY EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT ALASKA SOMETIMES EVEN BEFORE- IS IT IS FROM YOUR- POINT OF VIEW- ARTICLE OR POTENTIALLY. TO ATTACK THE NICOTINE. TO BE AS OF THE- RING SPUR A AGE. WHEN IN DEVELOPING TO STILL ON A SIGNIFICANT ON GOING ON THAT IS LIKELY THE CASE AND IT'S NOT SO CLEAR WHAT SORT OF AFFECTS WE WILL SEE- AND UNFORTUNATELY- MUCH LET THE DAM. THAT SUPPORT OTHER TYPES OF DOCTORS THAT WERE RIGHT. ON RIGHT IN TOP BEING A FIRST AS LIKE CIGARETTES ARE FILTERED. WERE GONNA THE DAMAGED GET NOW TERMS OF WHAT PROTECT WE HAVE IS IN THE BILLS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH. OF THE RITUAL. TO SO. THIS MAY UP DURING THE FARMS PUBLIC HEALTH UP ACTIVITY AND MANY WHAT WE'RE TO AT THIS POINT THEN THEN I SAY WE NEVER GIVE UP ON ANYBODY BUT ESSENTIALLY YOU. WHEN WE TALK THE ROLE THE RIVER RAP RISE IN USE FADING. BY ELIMINATING FLAVORS AS A POLICY DECISION WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS AND FOURTEEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH- AND ALSO MENTIONS INCLUDING- YOU KNOW THE COST TO OUR SOCIETY OF THE- TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS TO ALREADY STARTED VAPING. AB BECAUSE THEY WILL THEY'RE GOING TO WHETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE CIGARETTES ARE CONTINUE VAPING OR SOMETHING ARE EVEN BLACK MARKET- WHICH WILL RECEIVE THE DEATH THE LAW THAT THAT'S- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SAVE OUR NEXT GENERATION FROM BEING EXPOSED. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE'RE IT'S NOT THAT CERTAINLY WELL WE ELIMINATE THE FLAVORS AND PEOPLE STOP HATING AND ALL BE GOOD AGAIN IT'S ACTUALLY WE'VE CREATED. THE ARE WE CAN SAY THE VAPING INDUSTRY HAS CREATED A WHOLE GENERATION- VERY RAPIDLY. OF USE AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO WERE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP. AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO STOP THE BLEEDING NOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THE SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS WHO ALSO STRUGGLED% THE SAME ADDICTION PROBLEM CORRECT THAT WOULD BE CORRECT I THINK ONE OF THE- TREMENDOUS- SUCCESS STORY THINKING- IT'D NEW WORLDWIDE HAS BEEN WHAT WE'VE DONE INTO THE CONTROL HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY A SCENE LUNG CANCER RATES DECLINING IN AGAIN THOSE ARE THINGS THAT. DECADE TO DEVELOPING INDIVIDUALS AND SO- WE'VE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE LEAD THE WORLD IN TERMS OF- YOU DOING ABOUT THE CONTROL- BUT- IN TERMS OF VAPING AND WHILE I THINK THAT WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB IN TERMS OF TRYING TO TAKE DOWN. HAS GONE ON WITH BE PAYING IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AN EARLY RECOGNITION PARTICULAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THAT BEEPING WAS A SERIES TO EVEN BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN THINK THAT. TWO ONE TRY TO BUY THE THAT WE ARE SEEING AS YOU. FROM THE RECENT SERVE FROM MONITOR THE FUTURE THAT TO ABOUT HOW OVER QUARTER OF. A HIGH. YOU RV AT THE POINT AND WE THAT IS. THE NUMBERS THAT WE JUST DON'T SEE. A IN THE NEXT ANYMORE TRANSIT ABOUT PRODUCTS. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL THE FACT HE SAID WE ALREADY HAVE A QUARTER OF OUR USE- NOW EXPOSED TO A HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT THAT EVEN POSITIONS RIGHT NOW STRUGGLING TO HELP THOSE PATIENTS WE ENOUGH OF IT IS A FRIGHTENING THOUGHT AND THE IDEA THAT THAT WE WOULD ALLOW THIS CONTINUE CERTAINLY IS PART THE REASON WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING AND I KNOW OUR PUBLIC ALSO IS GOING TO WORK OUT LOOKING FORTY HEARING FROM THEM I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MUCH THANK YOU THANKS. OKAY NEXT UP WE HAVE. OUR DIRECTOR OF THE STATE OR POLICY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA. APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DOCTOR SONYA ANGEL WELCOME. I THINK THIS IS YOUR FIRST HEARING FOR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE TO ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. ALRIGHT I WOULD THE FOR I WAS TAUGHT TO PUSH THAT BUTTON SO FAR SO GOOD RIGHT- IT IS ABSOLUTELY A PLEASURE TO BE HERE- CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS MENTIONED I DOCTOR SONYA ANGEL AND THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. AND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT YOUTH VAPING IN OUR STATE AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF A VOLLEY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS- E. CIGARETTE VAPING ASSOCIATED LONG INJURY. THEN I'LL PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR YOU ON GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S INITIATIVE TO ADDRESS YOUTH VAPING IN CALIFORNIA ONE IN TEN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORT USING E. CIGARETTES OR VAPING. THAT'S BASED ON TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA AND REPRESENTS A YEARS EARLIER RISING FROM EIGHT POINT SIX TO TEN POINT NINE PERCENT. IN YOUNG ADULTS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE OVER ONE IN SEVEN REPORT E. CIGARETTE USE AND ITS USE IS INCREASING FASTEST AMONG THIS DEMOGRAPHIC FIFTEEN POINT 5% REPORTED USING E. CIGARETTES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A 53% INCREASE FROM TEN POINT ONE PERCENT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. DESPITE RAPID UPTAKE IN YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS ONLY THREE POINT 5% OF ADULTS AGE THIRTY OR OLDER REPORTED EASE CIGARETTE USE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AS THATTHAT A CHERUB PAN MENTION THIS IS LARGELY AN EPIDEMIC OF THE YOUNG. FLAVORED TOBACCO PART OF PRODUCTS ARE PARTICULARLY FAVORED AMONGST YOUTH ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA STUDENT TOBACCO SURVEY. EIGHTY SIX POINT 4% OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO USE THE CIGARETTES REPORT USING A FLAVORED PRODUCT. COMPARED WITH THE COUNTRY AT LARGE EASE CIGARETTE USE A MONTH CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER HOWEVER I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT 10% OF CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH REPORTING USING E. CIGARETTES IS ALARMING AND UNACCEPTABLE. WHEN SPEAKING OF YOUNG ADULTS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE CALIFORNIA'S DOING WORSE THE NATIONAL STATISTICS NATIONALLY SEVEN POINT 6% REPORTED USING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN COMPARED pWITH OUR RATE OF FIFTEEN POINT EPIDEMIC AMONG TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING BECAUSE NICOTINE IS HIGHLY A DEATH ADDICTIVE AND IT AFFECTS THE DEVELOPING BRAIN A PROCESS WHICH CONTINUES THROUGH YOUNG ADULTHOOD. MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE THAT NICOTINE IS A NEUROTOXIN OR A BRAIN POISON RESEARCH SHOWS THAT NICOTINE CAN AFFECT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. AND CAN WORSEN ANXIETY INCREASE LEARNING DIFFICULTIES MOOD SWINGS AND IMPULSIVITY NICOTINE'S EFFECT ON THE DEVELOPING BRAIN CAN BE PERMANENT. INFORMATION ON THE MORE GENERAL ADVERSE HEALTH AFFECTS OF THE CIGARETTES AND VAPING NICOTINE PRODUCTS CONTINUES TO EMERGE. ONE RECENT STUDY SHOWED LONG TERM HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH VAPING NICOTINE THAT INCLUDED INCREASED RISK OF LUNG RELATED ILLNESSES SUCH AS CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE CHRONIC BRONCHITIS EMPHYSEMA AND ASTHMA BY A THIRD COMPARED WITH THOSE WHO NEVER SMOKED DEBATE. E. CIGARETTE USE IS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK FOR HEART DISEASE GUM DISEASE AND TOOTH DECAY. NOW TURNING TO A VOLLEY VITAMIN E. ACETATE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST LIKELY CULPRIT OR CHEMICAL OF CONCERN FOR THIS SPECIFIC OUTBREAK BY THE CDC AND FDA. IT WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE UNREGULATED MARKET PLACE AS A DILUENT IN THC VAPING PRODUCTS THAT SAID WE CANNOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER CHEMICALS. INCLUDING BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE AFFECTED REPORT HAVING ONLY USED NON THC VAPING PRODUCTS. FIRST LET ME SHARE A BIT ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE OUTBREAK ITSELF IT WAS FIRST REPORTED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN CASES AND SIXTY DEATHS NATIONWIDE. IN CALIFORNIA AS OF FEBRUARY ELEVENTH THIS YEAR. THIRTY ONE CALIFORNIA CAUGHT A COUNTIES HAVE REPORTED CASES TOTALING TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT CASES WITH FOUR DEATHS IN OUR STATE. THE MEDIAN AGE OF THOSE AFFECTED IN CALIFORNIA IS TWENTY FIVE WITH AN AGE RANGE FROM FOURTEEN TO SEVENTY YEARS. THAT WERE HOSPITALIZED AND OF THOSE OF 45% REQUIRED INTENSIVE CARE. AND 28% REQUIRED MECHANICAL VENTILATION. A VAST MAJORITY OF PATIENTS 83% REPORTED RECENTLY VAPING THC PRODUCTS MOST OF WHICH WERE REPORTED TO BE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FROM NON REGULATED SOURCES. THE DEPARTMENT'S PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY WHICH IS LOCATED IN RICHMOND HAS BEEN TESTING LIQUID FROM VAPING PRODUCTS- THAT HAVE BEEN VOLUNTARILY RECOVERED FROM PATIENTS WITH A VOLLEY. FORTY NINE OF THE EIGHTY SEVEN PRODUCTS TESTED IN THESE REPRESENT TWENTY FOUR PATIENTS CONTAINED T. H. C. FORTY ONE OF THESE CONTAINS VITAMIN E. OR VITAMIN THE ACETATE. THE PEAK OF THE OUTBREAK WAS IN CALIFORNIA WAS BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER AS OF FEBRUARY THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CASES HAS SLOWED IT TO THREE TO FIVE CASES PER WEEK. WHEN NEWS BROKE UP INITIALLY BROKE OF THIS NEWLY DESCRIBED CLUSTER OF CASES ARE DEPARTMENT WAS QUICK TO RESPOND WE ACTIVATE OUR DEPARTMENT'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AND LAUNCH THESYSTEM OF THAT THOUGHT A QUICK COLLECTING INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL NEW CASES. ON AUGUST NINTH AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH AND OCTOBER FIRST WE RELEASED INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ALERTING THEM TO THE VAPING RELATED LONG INJURY OUTBREAK. THE ADVISORIES ALSO FOCUSED ON THE IDENTIFICATION REPORTING AND TREATMENT OF THE VOLLEY. WE ALSO STARTED COMMUNICATING WITH THE PUBLIC EARLY IN THE OUT BREAK THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED AN INFORMATIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTH AND ESTABLISHED AN EVIL THE WEBSITE. FOCUSED ON SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS OF THE VALLEY AND ENCOURAGING EVERYONE TO REFRAIN FROM VAPING NO MATTER THE SUBSTANCE OR SOURCE UNTIL THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION COULD BE COMPLETED. IN THE NATION WIDE EFFORT TO DETERMINE TE CAUSE MANY STATES ARE PROVIDED RECOVERED VAPING PRODUCTS TO THE FDA. OUT FOR TESTING OF RESIDUAL LIQUID WE'VE ALSO SHARED PRODUCTS AND PATIENT DE IDENTIFIED CASE DATA WITH THE FDA TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL INSPECTING CATION. THE DEPARTMENT THE VOLLEY TEAM IS COORDINATED WITH THE CDC AN ESSENTIAL PARTNER IN DETERMINING THE CAUSE SINCE CALIFORNIA'S CASES WERE FIRST IDENTIFIED EACH WEEK THE DEPARTMENT SHARES UPDATED CASE COUNTS AND PATIENT INFORMATION WITH THE CDC. THE DEPARTMENT AND IN PARTICULAR THE LAB THE RICHMOND LABORATORY SCIENCE TEAM ALSO SERVES A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON NATIONAL VAPING TASK FORCES- ONE OF WHICH IS WITH THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL EPIDEMIOLOGISTS. THE CITY WILL BE WINDING DOWN ITS NATIONALLY LED OUTBREAK INVESTIGATION BY THE END OF FEBRUARY IN OUR DEPARTMENT IS MOVING TOWARD STANDARDIZING. SURVEILLANCE OF THIS NEWLY DESCRIBES CONDITION ON GOING WE BELIEVE IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE REMAIN VIGILANT. IN CASE OF FUTURE OUTBREAKS. THE CONVERGENCE OF AN EPIDEMIC OF DATING NICOTINE IN TEAMS AND THE OF ALI OUTBREAK RECEIVED A SWIFT RESPONSE FROM GOVERNOR NEW SOME AS YOU'RE AWARE HE ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON SEPTEMBER SIXTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN. PURSUANT TO THIS ORDER ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED AND RELEASED A RAPID RESPONSE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN. CALLED OUTBREAK. NOW NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED THE OUTBREAK ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN SOUGHT TO REACH YOUNG ADULTS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINE AND PARENTS OF MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS TEENS. THE OB THE OBJECTIVE OF THE YOUNG ADULT CAMPAIGN WAS TO DISSUADE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM VAPING AND TO DECREASE THE INCIDENCE OF LONG ILLNESS OUTBREAK. ASSOCIATED BY VAPING. FOR PARENTS OBJECT WAS TO RAISE THEIR AWARENESS ABOUT THE HEALTH HARMS OF VAPING AND FOR THEM TO INITIATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR CHILDREN. THE PARENT TARGETED MEDIA CAMPAIGN AIRED IN SEVEN LANGUAGES INCLUDING SPANISH MANDARIN CANTONESE KOREAN. VIETNAMESE AND TO GARLIC. LUMINARY VALUATION OF MEDIA RESULTS HAS SHOWN THAT WAS EFFECTIVE AT DRIVING VIEWERS TO THEIR WEBSITES. ANOTHER KEY APPROACH TO ADDRESSING USE VAPING IS BY INCREASING THE PRICE OF THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE YOUTH ARE EXQUISITELY SENSITIVE TO PRICE. GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PROPOSES A NEW NICOTINE CONTENT BASED EASE CIGARETTE TAX TO BEGIN ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS TAX WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT TAX AND IT WOULD BE AT A RATE OF TWO DOLLARS PER FORTY MILLIGRAMS OF NICOTINE IN THE PRODUCT. IN ADDITION TO THE TAX COVER NEWSOME IS INDICATE GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS- INDICATED SUPPORT FOR A STATEWIDE BAN OF- THE SALE OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE KEY STEPS TO COMBAT THE RISE IN YOUTH VAPING I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON IS IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VIEW OUR DEPARTMENT AS A RESOURCE AS YOU CONSIDER POLICY. IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR ANGEL A QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A CENTER HELP IT THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU DOCTOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED OF THE TALK TO CERTAINLY ABOUT FLAVORS AND THE EPIDEMIC THAT WE'RE FACING BUT- IT WHAT ROLE DO YOU SEE FLAVORED PRODUCTS. CLEAN IN THE EPIDEMIC AND MORE BROADLY IN TERMS OF THE YOUTH PART OF THAT EPIDEMIC AND FLAVORED TOBACCO YEAH WE KNOW THAT YOUTH UP ARE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED TO FLAVOR PRODUCTS THEY SELF REPORT VERY HIGH USAGE OF THESE PRODUCTS OVER UNFLAVORED AND THEY MAKE THEM EASIER FOR IT USED TO USE WE THINK THAT THEY ARE. A KEY AND VERY IMPORTANT ATTRACTED THIS BEEN USED TO ENGAGE YOUTH IN INVADING WHEN IN FACT- THESE PRODUCTS TO NAME EVEN BE AVAILABLE TO THEM SO WE THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT STEP TO REMOVE A FOR ACCESS TO AND TO SUPPORT THE REMOVAL OF THE- LABOR PRODUCTS. HE'S THE QUESTIONS. MAY HAVE A COUPLE MYSELF BUT I DO ENJOY FIRST OF ALL I WANT A- APPRECIATE IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU TALKED ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE BRAIN- IN NICOTINE BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WE TALK ABOUT TOBACCO WE TALK ABOUT LUNGS AND CERTAINLY WE ONLY TALK ABOUT LUNG CANCER PREVENTION AND- WE TALK ABOUT IT WE THE BALI IS A LONG LONG CONDITION RIGHT- AND SO OFTEN TIMES THE FOCUSED ON THE LONG BUT I APPRECIATE AS A- PHYSICIAN MYSELF. THE REAL CHALLENGE ACTUALLY THE BRAIN. IT'S NICOTINE GETTING TO THE BRAIN THAT THEN COMPELS THE PERSON TO THEN SEEK OUT WHETHER COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE OR SOME OTHER TOBACCO ALTERNATIVES- THAT AND INJURES THE LONG AND OTHER ORGANS. SO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT BECAUSE I THINK TOO OFTEN WE TALK ABOUT TOBACCO WE TALK OF WE DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN ITSELF. AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THE BRAIN. SO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF CASES OF THE OF ALL THE HAVE DROPPED YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS IT MINISTRATION HAS ALREADY DONE- TO TRY TO- WARNED- USE AND PARENTS ABOUT THE- THE HAZARDS OF VAPING BUT CAN YOU BABY. TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- GREAT CASES ARE DOWN- PROBLEM SOLVED THE WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS I MEAN WHAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THE CASES DOWN OF ALL THE I MEAN IS IT- THE BLACK MARKETS DRIED UP- IS IT'S JUST PEOPLE OR DOUBTS MORE SCARED TO. NOT VOTING IT CAN. IS THERE IS THERE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH IS TO. CERTAINLY VERY HAPPY THAT'S HAPPENING. BUT CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO. MISTER DATA ABOUT WHAT WHY THE NUMBER OF CASES IS DOWN LIKE WHAT WE DOING RIGHT. YES WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT- ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT ABSOLUTELY TO YOUR POINT- IT COULD BE DUE TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE SO INDIVIDUALS MAY BE RESPONDING. BEING ARE AT AT ADVICE THAT THEY STOP EATING INTO VAPING AND PARTICULARLY THOSE PRODUCTS THAT THEY GET FROM THE INFORMAL MARKET IS CERTAINLY IT BEEN DEMO. THAT BY YEAH. WE BELIEVE ME THE CALL HAS BEEN THE IN THE INFORMAL AND- MARKET AND THEREFORE BY PEOPLE NOT USING THOSE AND ALSO POTENTIALLY THAT MOVING OUT OF THE MARKET- MAKES IT MORE LESS LIKELY THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE EXPOSED TO IT- BUT- AS I MENTIONED WE REMAIN VIGILANT IT'S NOT CLEAR. THAT THIS IS- GONE FOR EVER AND THEREFORE ARE CONTINUING SURVEILLANCE AND INVESTMENT IN SURVEILLANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS IS GOING TO BE IS GOING TO BE KEY GOING FORWARD. OKAY AND THEN. CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO SO WE ONLY KNOW THAT- FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS INCLUDING- VAPING FLAVORS ARE POPULAR WITH USE- SOMETIMES SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT WELL YOU KNOW THE OLD LIKE THEM TO AND- BUT. TERM TO SMOKING SUS. SINCE THAT'S ONE OF OTHER CLAIM. DO YOU TRAVESTY TO THE NASA. OUR LACK OF FLAVOR. AT SOMEONE TO WAS TO. THE FOR NOW SEEKING TO. QUIT TODAY TO HOW PHONE ROLL THIS LEAVING PLAY AND THE CHOICES THEY MAKE IN THAT CASE. SO IT A COUPLE OF THE POINTS YOU MAKE FIRST OF ALL. IN THE DOTS OVER THIRTY I'D MENTION THAT IS JUST OER 3% THAT ACTUALLY RIGHT USE THESE PRODUCTS SO LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. THAT THE REALLY WHO IS USING THESE PRODUCTS ARE USE- THEIR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS THAT IS THAT IS WHERE THE PREPONDERANCE OF USED IS. WHEN IT COMES TO THINKING. USING YOUTH THEY WEREN'T USING IT BEFORE THEY'RE NOT USING IT TO SORT OF WEAN OFF OF ANY PRODUCTS SO THERE'S NO ARGUMENT THAT CAN BE MADE FOR USE IN THAT SENSE- IN ADULTS WE HAVE AS MENTIONED EARLIER A NUMBER. OF DEMONSTRATED EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES TO SMOKING CESSATION-NICOTINE REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS THAT EXIST. THEREFORE FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR THOSE ADULTS THAT VERY SMALL PERCENT OF ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF THIRTY WHO ACTUALLY USING THESE PRODUCTS FOR SMOKING CESSATION THERE ARE ALL OTHER ALTERNATIVES. OF THEIR CERTAINLY ON THE MARKET PLACE FOR THEM. SO TO JUSTIFY KEEPING FLAVORED PRODUCTS SPECIFICALLY. ON THE MARKET FOR THAT VERY SMALL- PERCENT OF ADULTS IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT THAT THAT EVIDENCE SPACES BEEN CREATED THAT IT'S NECESSARY FOR THEM TO STOP SMOKING. BUT WHAT IS VERY CLEAR WITH BUT IN SUPPORT ABSOLUTELY IS THOSE THAT. THOSE PARKS ARE BEING USED BY AND LARGE BY OUR YOUTH AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE'RE ALL HERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT WELL I WANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- APPRECIATE- USE THE THAT THE ANSWERS YOU GAVE THE SAID THREE ONLY 3% LOAN ADULTS SO WITH SETS THREE POINT THIRTY RIGHT COMPARED TO THE PERCENTAGE IN OUR YOUTH OUR YOUTH WHICH IS ABOUT ONE INTENDS A LITTLE OVER 10% AND IN OUR YOUNG ADULTS- FIFTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. SAYS LIFE HAVING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO'S REALLY WHOSE WHOSE LIVES ARE AT STAKE FROM FROM THIS EPIDEMIC LOT OF PEOPLE BEING EXPOSED TO NICOTINE THAT'S CORRECT BURNED USE THANK YOU SIR REMEDY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. RIGHT CASE ONLY BE UP FOR NEXT BECAUSE I KNOW LOW GUY ARE WORK VERY HARD TO AND THEIR POLICIES TREES ACCESS TO VAPING PRODUCTS WE HAVE- DANIEL PRETTY CORD A DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND CONTRA COSTA HEALTH SERVICES AND- DOCTOR TRYSTS FOR NINETEEN TEN FERNANDO OKAY HEALTH OFFICER CONTRA COSTA I SHOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- DOCTOR GOING FROM THE SITTING COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WAS UNABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY AND I THINK HAD TO DEAL WITH THE VIRUS ISSUE OR SOMETHING SO- BUT- AND- I KNOW. THAT TO YOU WILL OF THE WILL WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER ME QUESTION AND LOW FOR TO. A WELCOME AND THANKS MUCH FOR BEING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A PAY AND CAN MEMBERS I'M CORE THE DRUG OF PUBLIC FOR CON COSTA HOW SERVICES AND AS YOU KNOW IN JOINT. BY CHRIS FARRAKHAN OR ARE OFFICE AND ALSO LIKE DIRECT. TO TOBACCO STAFF TO MY AND MY LOPEZ WHO REALLY HELPED US GET READY FOR OUR PRESENTATION TODAY SO THANK THE TWO OF YOU. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TO THE COMMITTEE AND OFFER SOME INSIGHTS AS TO HOW WE ARE USING LOCAL POLICY. TO ADDRESS THE EPIDEMIC OF YOUTH USE OF TOBACCO RELATED PRODUCTS SPECIFICALLY VAPING PRODUCTS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN CONTRA COSTA WORST WITNESS THE START OF AN ALARMING INCREASE IN THE PREVALENCE OF YOUTH VAPING AS THE SLIDE ILLUSTRATES. THE SLIGHTEST ILLUSTRATE SYSTEM THREE OF OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS. YOU NOTICE THAT MARTINEZ HIGH SCHOOL JUMPED FROM 8% OF ELEVENTH GRADERS WHO SAID THEY HAD Vì IN THE PAST THIRTY DAYS 230% IN THE TWO YEARS BETWEEN THE SURVEY PERIODS ADDITIONALLY IN THIS IS NOT ON THE SLIDE. IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SURVEY ACALANES HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS IN LAFAYETTE. WAS NOTED AS HAVING THE HIGHEST RATE OF YOUTH BEEPING IN THE ENTIRE BAY AREA 25% AT THE TIME. IN RESPONSE TO THIS URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. THE CONTRA COSTA ADOPTED AN ORDINANCE TO BAN THE SALE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN PROXIMITY TO YOUTH SENSITIVE AREAS THIS INCLUDED FLAVORED E. CIGARETTES IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. SUBSEQUENTLY WITH THE EMERGENCE OF THE ACUTE VAPING ASSOCIATED ILLNESS THE VALLEY. AND REFLECTING ON THE DATA WE'VE PRESENTED THE CONTRA COSTA BOARD OF SUPERVISORS EXTENDED THEIR BAN ON FLAVOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO THE ENTIRE UNINCORPORATED COUNTY. IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN JUST VERY RECENTLY. AND ADDITIONALLY WE BANNED THE SALE OF ALL THE PING PRODUCTS IN THE UNINCORPORATED COUNTY. THIS SPECIFIC ACTION WAS TAKEN IN RECOGNITION THAT NONE OF THESE PRODUCTS HAVE YET MET THE REQUIRED FDA PREMARKET REVIEW AN AUTHORIZATION PROCESS THAT WENT INTO EFFECT IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN BEFORE THE U. S. HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE. ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS DR NORMAN SHARPLESS THE INTERN DIRECTOR OF THE U. S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION STATED. NO ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEM PRODUCT IN THE UNITED STATES IS ON THE MARKET LEGALLY. ALL E. CIGARETTES CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET ARE ILLEGAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ASSESSED BY THE FDA. HENCE THE IMMEDIATE GOAL OF THE CONTRA COSTA ORDINANCE WAS TO CREATE CONDITIONS IN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE PROTECTIVE TO YOUTH IS WE'VE NOTED IS A YOUTH EPIDEMIC. IF THE EXPOSURE TO FINE PARTICULATE MATTER WHICH IS A BIG DEAL. AND TOBACCO CONSTITUENTS IS NOT ENOUGH. WE'VE MENTIONED TODAY THAT THESE PRODUCTS CONTAIN ONE OF THE MOST ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES EVER PUT IT THE CONSUMER PRODUCT NICOTINE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE STANDS TO DRAMATICALLY REVERSE DECADES LONG TREND. IN TOBACCO PREVENTION WE SEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL HELP CURB THE SURGE IN YOUTH USE WHICH IN TURN WILL YIELD LONG TERM HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AND PREVENT COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF CASES OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS CANCER AND DEATH NOT TURN IT OVER TO DR FARZANA. SO IN TOTAL CONTRA COSTA COUNTY HAS NINETEEN DIFFERENT CITIES AS WELL AS THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH TO TRY TO ALIGN OUR- TOBACCO PREVENTION POLICIES AND REGULATION AND THAT AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS MAP- THERE ARE FIVE JURISDICTIONS WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN IN GREEN INCLUDING THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS. THAT HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED A BAN ON FLAVOR TOBACCO- IN THOSE FIVE- JURISDICTIONS TWO OF THEM HAVE ALSO- ADOPTED LIMIT AND- ON THE SALE OF NON FDA APPROVED BEEPING PRODUCTS SO ARE ARE UNINCORPORATED COUNTY AS WELL AS RICHMOND WHICH IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST CITIES- AND AGAIN NONE OF THE- VAPING PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. ES DE PENSION HAVE ON WE ARE LEGAL IN THE NOT BEEN REVIEWED BY THE FDA FOR EITHER THEIR SAFETY OR THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND THESE ARE DRUG DELIVERY DEVICES IN THE FTA. IN A REALLY I SHOULD BE AND HAS SO FAR NOT EXERCISED ITS AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THESE AND KEEP THESE OFF OF THE MARKET. SO THE GOAL OF OUR ACCOUNT ORDINANCE ON HAS TO BAN THESE FLAVOR TOBACCO AND BEEPING PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO REDUCE. REDUCE THE USE ACCESS AND EXPOSURE TO THESE A TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND PREVENT A NEW GENERATION OF USE BECOMING ADDICTED. TO NICOTINE AND WE KNOW FROM STUDIES WITH CIGARETTES THAT YOU KNOW IT CAN TAKE JUST A HUNDRED- CIGARETTES SMOKED ANY USES ALREADY ADDICTED AND WE KNOW WITH PRODUCTS LIKE TOOL. FIVE OF THOSE LITTLE CARTRIDGES HAVE AS MUCH NICOTINE IS NOT A HUNDRED CIGARETTES- IF YOU LOOK AT THEM THIS NEXT MAP THE LITTLE DOTS IN RED. ARE THE TOBACCO RETAILERS THAT- ARE- AFFECTED BY ORDINANCE AND AS YOU CAN SEE MANY OF THESE ARE RIGHT ON THE BORDERLINE BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ADOPTED FLAVOR RESTRICTIONS. AND THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY TOBACCO PREVENTION PROP POLICIES. TO USE CAN STILL ACCESS WEEPING PRODUCTS AND FLAVORED TOBACCO WHEN THEY GO SOMETIMES DOWN THE STREET SOMETIMES JUST ACROSS THE STREET OR NEXT DOOR FROM ONE JURISDICTION. THAT REGULATES THESE PRODUCTS AND ANOTHER NEIGHBORING CITY THAT DOES NOT AND THAT'S WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE STATEWIDE ACTION TO CREATE A UNIFORM. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND ELEVEN LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR RETAILERS- AND WHILE FEDERAL ACTION IS CERTAINLY WELL THE CURRENT FEDERAL LOOPHOLE ON RECHARGEABLE DEVICES IN REFILLABLE AND DISPOSABLE DEVICES IS A REALLY BIG CONCERN IN THERE ARE ANECDOTES THAT YOUTH ALREADY SWITCHING- TO THESE. DEVICES THAT AREN'T GOING TO BE COVERED BY CURRENT FEDERAL REGULATIONS- SO IT'S REALLY STATE. STATE ACTION IS SO IMPORTANT. THANK YOU SIR MUCH QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE RETAILERS DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY VIOLATIONS CITY RETAILER CAN GET BEFORE THEY LOSE THEIR PERMIT. THERE'S BEEN A QUESTION FOR RYAN BUT I BELIEVE IT'S THREE. IS THAT RIGHT SO WE HAVE A SORT OF A- SUCCESSION OF PHONE OKAY OF PENALTY IN AT THE THIRD ONE WE CAN ACTUALLY REMOVE THEIR- LOCAL. TOBACCO ILL THAT'S WHAT HAVE A LOCAL TOBACCO LICENSING- INITIATIVE IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND DO WE FIND THE THAT RETAILERS ARE VIOLATING THE- VIOLATING THIS AND THAT THEY ARE HAVING THEIR PERMITS PULLED THAT'S FAIRLY REALLY WE'VE FAIRLY RARE THAT THAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTY I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A SINGLE INCIDENT WE WERE WHERE WE- ACTUALLY HAD TO PULL LICENSE. IS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT VIOLATING THE LAW OR BECAUSE THERE'S NOT SOMEONE THERE TO POLICE THEM WELL IT AYE AYE WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE OR LESS COMPLIANT WE DO HAVE A FAIRLY- AGGRESSIVE COMPLIANCE- YOU SHOULD HAVE IN COOPERATION WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIR HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IT USUALLY REQUIRES A STING OPERATION IN ORDER TO CATCH THEM AT THAT AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE EASIEST. TO PUT TOGETHER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE TO THE CHALLENGE AND ON THAT- IT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IN IN CONTRA COSTA WHICH IS REALLY GREAT THAT THE- FIVE. HAVE FLAVORED BANDS AND TO HAVE- VAPING PRETTY MUCH PROHIBITIONS OUT OF THE NINETEEN CITIES TO WHICH TO ATTRIBUTE THE- ROAD BLOCKS IF ANY THAT ARE. PREVENTING THOSE OTHER JURISDICTIONS. PREVENT LEAN FORWARD WITH SOME BANNERS AND WHEN AND HOW CAN WE HELP THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND- IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AND MY OVER TWENTY YEARS AS A- PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR THAT. CITIES LIKE TO SEE THEIR COUNTY GO FIRST- IN JUST HAVING RECENTLY PASSED THE COUNTY. BàN ON. DATING PRADA IN I THINK IT WAS NO FOR. THE LAST YEAR WERE FOR OFFERED. NEW WITH THIS THE REASON. OUR TEAM GOING LITERALLY TO SEE. MAKING MEETING WITH MAYOR AND OTHER LIKE OFFICIAL. THE INTRODUCED WHAT WE'VE DONE WE'RE STARTING TO GET- A LOT OF CALLS FROM CITIES OUT OF INTEREST SO. SORTS ARE OPEN IN A YEAR. FROM NOW WE WOLD HAVE. THE MORNING OF OUR CITIES ARE DOT IMILAR POLICIES. HOPEFULLY WE HELP YOU WITH THAT THE ON THAT BE WONDER I THINK IS. FAR MEANT THAT WOULD BE THE RELIEF IDEAL HAVE STAY. PAUL ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR GREAT WORK AT THE- GRASSROOTS ON THE TO HELP IN SUBTLE AND WITH THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR. OTHER QUESTIONS. HEY WHY WITH YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR FOR AND I HAVE A FEW HERE NOW THE CITY OF A BECAUSE THAT MATTER SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW. A CAL WIDE MAY ARE THE CITY ARE SO EACH CITY SEISMIC ON THE CITY WE THE ON IN COURT. BAND RIGHT THEN I BELIEVE THIS OF RICH. HAS ALSO A COME CITY BAN. ALL RIGHT SO IT'S STILL KIND OF. AND THAT'S ON THE PRODUCTS. OKAY WELL THIS WHO HAVE BANNED FLAVORED TOBACCO AS WELL OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO- GIVEN YOUR CURRENT EXPERIENCE AS SOME OF IT'S FAIRLY RECENT- SO. AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A THIS. WHAT DO YOU SEE IS. HAPPENING TO- THE PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY YOU WERE DATING BEFORE ARE WE SEEING A AND AGAIN RECOGNIZING THAT. THERE WILL BE A SWISS CHEESE SO MAYBE THE EASIEST THING FOR PEOPLE SIMPLY MOVE YOU KNOW GO BY FROM A JURISDICTION THAT HASN'T THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH RIGHT. AS OF TWO IS A CHALLENGE BUT- FOR EXAMPLE DO YOU SEE A RISE AND BLACK MARKETS. ACTIVITY WERE ARE IS THERE I'M AND JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF CIEL- WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCES WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE BAND SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE. INVADING BEFORE- THE DISEASE THE VIEWS WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT NICOTINE SO ADDICTED RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO SO OBVIOUSLY WHAT IMPACT YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO. SMOKE ARE KEEPING THEY JUST DON'T START RIGHT I MEAN THAT THAT THAT IS GOAL NUMBER ONE MUCH OKAY AND THAT HOPEFULLY IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL SEE HAPPEN THAT MAKES IT BASICALLY THEY WON'T SEEK IT OUT. SINCE DESERVE IT ALL THE HAVE THE GOING TO GRAD SOMETHING. AND ANY OF PEOPLE WHO BASED. AND ON THE- AND WHAT DO THEY UP DOING THE- LETTER PERCENT OF USING THE FIFTEEN FOR. STAY THAT WE FOR SENATE WHAT DID HE AND DOING ALSO YOU SO WITH YOU HAVE A INFORMATION ON THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO SHARE. HER I REALIZE IS SOME OF THIS IS FAIRLY RE. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. I JUST TOLD A LITTLE BIT AND RYAN. FEEL FREE TO COME UP AND JOIN A YOU WISH TO THEY COME THAT WHEN HE SPEAKS TO BE JUST AND- SOME THAT'S GRAY I DO THINK THAT INITIALLY THAT ARE OUR GOAL WAS. CREATE FRANK TO MAKE IT HARDER AND HARDER GET THESE PRODUCTS IN OUR COUNTY THAT THAT WAS NUMBER ONE GOAL IT'S PROBABLY LITTLE EARLY TO TELL IF THE BEEPING NUMBERS ARE DOWN. WILL AND START SEE THAT THE NEXT SURVEY PER IT'S FOR BURKE THAT BE VERY LIST OF THE STUFF FOR OF ACTUALLY BORNE FRUIT I CAN'T. THE BLACK MARKET ISSUE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING BY THAT. WE ACTUALLY. INSIDE MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEW POLICIES NOW- OUR- ORDINANCE WE DID GET ADOPTED IN NOVEMBER AND IT WASN'T EFFECTIVE THIRTY DAYS LATER WHICH WAS IN DECEMBER. AND THEN WE GAVE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS OF- TO FOR OUR RETAILERS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE SO- UP UNTIL FIVE APRIL FIRST IS WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REALLY. KIND OF UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OF IMPACT THAT'S GONNA AFFECT OUR UNINCORPORATED AREAS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT TOBACCO RETAILERS WHEN THEY NEED TO ADJUST AS WELL WE'VE GIVEN THEM THAT- YOU KNOW THAT. GRACE PERIOD ALLOWING THEM TO SELL OFF THEIR- THE REST OF THE PRODUCTS AND NOT ALLOWING THEM TO BUY ANYMORE- BEYOND WIND DECEMBER ORDINANCE PASSED. BUT ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF- FDA APPROVED TOBACCO CESSATION- DEVICES THAT ARE APPROVED FOR USE CERTAINLY SOME PHYSICIANS MAY USES OFF LABEL FOR USE BOTH NICOTINE. REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND MEDICATIONS LIKE ANTICS AND APPROPRIATE ON- BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS REALLY PREVENTING YOU FROM GETTING ADDICTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE A THING- PLACES LIKE THE CALIFORNIA SMOKERS HELP LINE IS DEVELOPING. IN OF PEEPING FOCUSED- STRATEGIES TO HELP PEOPLE GET OFF OF NICOTINE BUT AGAIN THE- GATE KEEPING YOU FROM GETTING ADDICTED IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THE MAIN GOAL. HI AND THEN I GUESS OTHER QUESTION IS THE THIS IS REALLY YOUR EXPERIENCE WELL CERTAINLY- SO I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BAKING LEGISLATION WE DO HAVE RETAILERS COME UP AND SAY WELL. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO KILL MY BUSINESS NOW I THINK THERE'S AN ARGUMENT ABOUT. DO YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT SELLING THINGS THAT ARE HARMFUL TO PEOPLE BUT WE WERE BUT LET'S JUST MOVE THAT TO THE SIDE BRIEFLY HAVE YOU SEEN ANY RETAILERS- GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE BANDS THAT YOU'VE PUT IN PLACE WE'VE NOT AND I'M ASKING LEGAL AND TURN THIS OVER TO RYAN TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS ILLUSTRATIVE ONE RYAN SHARED WITH ME THAT ONCE WE WENT TO THE ENTIRE UNINCORPORATED COUNTY IN BAND- FLAVORS AND EVEN PRODUCTS RETAILER SAID. THANK YOU BECAUSE NOW YOU'VE CREATED A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR US. YEAH THAT WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR OUR RETAILERS WANTED PARITY- THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ORDINANCE ONLY ALLOWED- THOSE WITHIN WITH UP OUTSIDE OF THE ONE THOUSAND FEET BOUNDARY TO SELL AT THE FLAVOR TO- TOBACCO SO WHEN WE HAD THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE AND CORPORATE AREA IT ALLOWED TO TOBACCO RETAILERS WE HAVE. YOUR BILL. KNOWN TO THE- OF TOBACCO. NOW SO FAR HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW AT A BUSINESS I THINK A FEW PEOPLE HAVE JUST DECIDED WHEN. THEIR RENEWAL OVER THEIR TOBACCO LICENSE- EXPIRED IN DIDN'T WANNA- RENEW IT- BUT AT THAT AT THE TIME WHAT WE ARE GEARING TOWARDS IS REALLY- HEALTHY NEW. HEALTHY RETAIL RATE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IN OUR EDUCATION WITH OUR RETAILERS WE ALLOW THEM TO REALLY UNDERSTAND TO BE ABLE TO. DO MORE HEALTHY RETAIL TO BE A LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT I JUST YES I CERTAINLY. WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT YOUTH- AND KEEPING THEM FROM GETTING ADDICTED I REALLY JUST WANT TO A SHOUT OUT TO SOME OF THE STUDENTS THAT KERRY HIGH SCHOOL IN POMONA. THEY ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN SOMETHING CALLED THE SAMPSON CHALLENGE WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO WIN MONEY SO THAT THE DEVICE THAT THEY HAVE CREATED. TO DETECT VAPING ON THEIR CAMPUS WILL ACTUALLY BE THE BILL TO PUT IT INTO PRODUCTION SO WE EVEN HAVE YOUTH THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT OTHER YOUTH I JUST MET WITH THEM ON SATURDAY VERY IMPRESSIVE GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SO. WE ALL WORK TOGETHER WE CAN WIN TOGETHER. CENTER HER TADA. I JUST WANT TO GO AHEAD AND COMMENT IN AND FOLLOW THAT. AT SO IN MY HOME TOWN OUR CURRENT SINGER OUR HIGH SCHOOL IS IMPLEMENTED EIGHT EIGHT NEW PROGRAM WHERE THEY HAVE THE BABY- DETECTION- MONITORS. AND THE PROVIDE REAL TIME- AT THAT INFORMATION- TO THE ADMINISTRATORS I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING SO. THEY'RE GOING AHEAD AND BEGINNING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION- PROCESS BUT THE SAID REAL TIME ALERTS FOR QUICK RESPONSE THEY ALSO AT THE IT ALSO IDENTIFIES AGGRESSIVE BULLYING AND- BEHAVIOR- I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS. SOMETHING VERY FASCINATING THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON IF I'M SURE. THERE'S PROBABLY SOME INFORMATION ALREADY OUT THERE BUT- ALONG WITH THAT THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT INTERVENTION- NOT JUST PUNISHMENT BUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO. CONTINUE TO. PUT A PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT WILL HELP THEM MOVE AWAY FROM IT. JUST COMMENT ON THAT- WE HAVE SEEN IN THERE AS A COALITION BETWEEN THE REGIONAL BIT BAY AREA- TOBACCO PREVENTION PROGRAMS A LOT OF THE COUNTIES COME TOGETHER AND WE TALK ABOUT THE VAPING DEVICES AND WE HAVE- KIND OF DISCUSS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE OF THOSE DEVICES. A LOT OF TIMES THEY DO DETECT THAT THERE ARE THERE IS BEEPING HAPPENING WENT ON A SATURDAY AND NOBODY'S THERE SO- THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF A- FALSE- DETECTION SOMETIMES AND SO I THINK- WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CALIFORNIA DEPARTURES THIS WE HAVE A GREAT WITH THE- WELL. REALLY UNDERSTANDING STIFF I WORK WHICH DO NOT IS REALLY HELPFUL AS WELL SO JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON THAT. CERTAINLY HEARING FROM SCHOOL MINUTE. WHAT A BIG PROBLEM THE IS IT'S OVER. THAT THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN THERE IF THERE'S HAVING SPENT A LOT OF RESOURCES TO TRY TO ADDRESS. THIS ISSUE RATHER THAN FOCUS ON TEACHING THEIR STUDENTS. THIRTY DOLLARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- THIS PANEL VERY ENLIGHTENING I HAVE A QUESTION I ASKED- SENATOR HILL I KNOW HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT THE BIG BILL AND- HE'S ADDRESSED ONLINE SALES BUT IS THERE ANY DATA POINT- IN YOUR COUNTY ON ONLINE SALES AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE COMPARED TO THE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS JUST CURIOUS AS TO. WHAT THAT. YEAH YEAH OF COURSE- SO WHEN. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY- JAPAN THOUGH SOME OF THE DATA THAT DâN ALREADY HAD SHARED. WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY WE NOTICED THAT- WHEN ELEVENTH GRADERS IN THE ALL THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WE ASKED IT THEY NOTED THAT. ABOUT 74277% SAID IT WAS VERY EASY OR FAIRLY EASY. TO OBTAIN KEEPING PRODUCTS NOW. KIND OF. DISCUSSING WHERE THOSE PRODUCTS WERE OBTAINED KINDA LOOKING AT THE NATIONAL DATA AS WELL AS THE STATE DATA- FROM THE- CALIFORNIA STUDENT TOBACCO- SURVEY WE SAW THAT ONLY ABOUT LESS THAN NINE PERCENT- WORD GETTING THEIR PRODUCTS FROM- ONLINE. SO WHERE ARE THEY GETTING THESE PRODUCTS ABOUT 3031% SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE BUYING THEM. FOR THEMSELVES AT THE STORE. AND THEN- THEY ALSO GET IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE WHICH IS EITHER THEIR FRIEND OR SOMEONE THEY KNOW. ABOUT THE 6% SAID THEY WERE BECAUSE THEY WERE GETTING THAT FROM THERE UP FROM SOMEONE. BILL CONLEY SALE WHEN THEY MAKE THAT ARGUMENT IS IT'S TO SO FAR WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT'S NOT WHERE STUDENTS ARE GETTING IT FROM. IT'S REALLY THE LOCAL STORE FRONTS. BERRYHILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON ON A SENATOR GONZALEZ- COMMENTS ON THE ON LINE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY OF CONCERN TO SO MANY OF US THAT. IN THE LAST YEAR THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SUPPORTED WHICH TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST ALL ONLINE PURCHASES OF. E. CIGARETTE OR TOBACCO PRODUCTS NOW HAVE THE SAME HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS AS ALCOHOL DOES WORK HAS TO BE DELIVERED TO SOMEONE TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE SIGN FOR THAT PRODUCT AS WELL SO. I THINK WE'VE TRIED TO LOOK AT THAT ISSUE TO CLEAN IT UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE BY UNDERSTANDING BEFORE WAS THAT THEY WERE IN MANY CASES THROWING IT ON THE DOORSTEP AND PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO PICK IT UP FROM THAT. AS WELL AND IN AN INTERESTING ASIDE AND TALKING ABOUT THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE DETECTION AND- OF THE PAPER. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WHO IS A SPONSOR OF THE LEGISLATION I HAVE THIS YEAR ON FLAVOR TOBACCO- AND- IF AT U. CIGARETTE BAND. SHE INDICATED IN COMMON WITH HER SONS GO TO HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THAT. WHEN THERE IS- OF RECESS OR A- YOU BREAKING CLASSES THEY ALL FLED TO THE- RESTROOM AND- BABY AND IT SETS OFF THE ALARM TO SMOKE ALARMS BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICAL. COMBUSTION OUR WORKS WITHIN THOSE. AND HAVE TO CLEAR THE SCHOOL IN FIRE HAS TO COME IN AND- AND- IT AND GO THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCEDURE OF MAKING SURE THAT IT'S SAFE BEFORE THE- THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS CAN COME BACK INTO SCHOOL SO IT'S VERY DISRUPTIVE AS WELL AS A PROBLEM SO THERE'S DETECTION DEVICES. COULD BE HELPFUL TO SOMEONE TO. GET BEFORE IT CAN GET OUT OF HAND SO. THANK YOU FOR THIS DISCUSSION TODAY WAS REALLY WONDERFUL THANK YOU PICTURE. AN EX UP FOR THE RECORD AND SURE IF YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF THE RECORD THIS. OF HIS YOUR NAME YOUR POSITION AND- I APOLOGIZE MANY WAS RIGHT SCHUMACHER ON THE TOBACCO PREVENTION- MANAGER AT CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. OKAY THANK YOU JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY FORMALLY ON THE AGENDA- I'D SO LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION- I CAN ACT. I CAN ASK THIS OF- DIRECTOR ANGEL BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SHE IS A- DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR AND- HAS TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- BUT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS COUNTY HEALTH LEADERS- SO WHEN. MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE POLICY PART AROUND WILL BE A PASSING LAWS OR SO FORTH- BUT NOW. IS WE SAID THE OUR FIRST GOAL IS TO PREVENT. YOUTH FROM STARTING IN THE FIRST PLACE RIGHT AND WE HOPE THE POLICIES WILL DO THAT TO THIS WEEK'S WORK ON THOSE POLICIES. SHE THE GOVERNOR'S. LEADERSHIP AND THE PROPOSALS THAT COME OUT HIS SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING- FLAVORS OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO. THE PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING- THROUGH A- ATTACKS ON NICOTINE- BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT- SAID WE HAVE PEOPLE RAVEN EXPOSED. TO VAPING AND EIGHTEEN- WHETHER THROUGH VAPING WHICH IS WERE SENIOR USE ARE POSSIBLE CIGARETTES- YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOUR OF LIMITING YOUR POLICY WE HAVE TO- WHAT. OTHER THINGS SHOULD THE STATE BE FUNDING TO ASIDE FROM DOING OUR POLITICIAN A STATEWIDE POLICY CHANGES IN ORDER TO BE SURE WE- MITIGATE THE IMPACTS THAT EVERY HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF BEING IN TOBACCO SO FOR TO WE EVER EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE THERE. THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF EDUCATION OR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF- YELLS SUBSTANCE VEGAS NICOTINE TREATMENTS AT CETERA SO CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO WATER MAYBE SOME OTHER THINGS THE STATE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BEYOND JUST POLICY CHANGE IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS THAT- WEEK. SHOULD BE SUPPORTING- AND THAT- COUNTIES WOULD BE LIKE YOURS WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT BEYOND THE POLICY CHANGES YOU'RE SAYING OKAY WHAT WELL WE MADE THE POLICY CHANGE BUT NOW WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES RESULT IN BECAUSE OF THAT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND- MENTAL TICKET AT LEAST AN INITIAL STEP BUT THAT BEFORE CHRIS AND RYAN COMMENT BUT I THINK AS WE ALL KNOW THE SINGLE% MOST IMPORTANT TOOL WE ALL HAVE. SITS ON THE DíAS- IT'S PUBLIC POLICY RIGHT WE KNOW THAT THAT MAKES A PROFOUND DIFFERENCE IN SHAPING THE LIVED ENVIRONMENT AND REALLY WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO OUR YOUTH AND GIVEN THE COMMENTS TODAY THAT THIS REALLY IS A YOUTH EPIDEMIC I WOULD- REFLECT THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE- AROUND THE U. CESSATION BECAUSE WE HAVE. ADDICTED A NEW GENERATION OF YOUNG INDIVIDUALS POTENTIALLY WILL HAVE A LIFETIME OF NAKED IN ADDITION MADE LEADS OTHER FORMS OF ADDICTION THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING. REPLY ON THE THAT YOU THE WE HAD FAR LOW JURISDICTIONS THEY COME BY TO HE YOU SOME USED WAS AROUND OR SO PERCENT. AND WE WERE ALL KIND OF OR ON THE THAT UP DECADE THAT FOR REALLY IT CEMEX AND NOW THE IS TURNED AROUND A NEED ISN'T SHORT YEARS. THAT WOULD COMMENTS. I WOULD. CONTINUE UNDER. OF SERVICE SECOND CAN REALLY PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;N&lt;/c&gt;</u> YOUTH EDUCATE YOU AND A CITY YOU IN QUICKLY I MEAN THIS. SMOKERS HELP LINE IS START TO THE- TOOLS THAT ARE DIRECTLY- FOCUSED ON VAPING USERS- THERE'S OTHER- PRODUCTS LIKE THIS TEXT TO CRITICS OF VAPING- THAT- WORKS WITH- USERS. TO TAX TO HELP GIVE THEM- ASSISTANCE IN INCLUDING SO. SO BILLS YOU KNOW IN MARKETING TO OUR ADVERTISING PROMOTING- CESSATION TO USE WAR CONTAINING THE WARN THEM OF THE DANGERS- ENCOURAGING THEM TO QUIT. AND THEN PUT A PROVIDING SOME TOOLS AND ASSISTANCE TO QUITTING. ON TOP OF THOSE TWO SUGGESTIONS- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A YOUTH EPIDEMIC. AND WE CANNOT KEEP DOING THE SAME THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE FOR ADULTS. AND YOUTH ARE ONLINE IN THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO WHAT I WOULD BE ASKING THEN IS FOR A FULL FOR MORE FUNDING ARE BEEFING UP THE FUNDING. ON REALLY BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIOR IS THE PERCEPTIONS AND ATTITUDES OF VAPING PRODUCTS WITH THE YOUTH AND ON THE YOUNG ADULTS. I MEAN SAYIN THE SAME MESSAGE OVER AND OVER IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO ATTRACT THE USED TO BE UNDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH. THIS IS AFFECTING THEM BEING ABLE TO REALLY AT THIS DISCUSS THAT. THE PLATFORM THAT THEY'RE ALL IN IN A PLACE AND A AND- DIRECT WAY OF ADDRESSING THAT THROUGH MEANS THAT THEY UNDERSTAND IS THE BEST WAY TO REALLY GET THEM. TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS IS AFFECTING THEM. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. NO WELL I WANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO I RECOGNIZE THAT- YEAH AND THAT- THE GOVERNOR DID. YOU KNOW- AND THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT TALK ABOUT AN AD CAMPAIGN THAT THEY DID OUTBREAK AND THE RESULTS OF THAT BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE HEARING S THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STAY IN THOSE EFFORTS- SO. WE CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON POLICY CHANGE HERE APPRECIATE CENTER HILLS LEADERSHIP. AND THAT- AND OTHERS- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO THINK IN ADDITION TO POLICY CHANGE WE ALSO NEED TO SURE WE SUPPORT OUR- STATE AND COUNTY HEALTH OFFICES TO BE ABLE TO BE FREE OF THE PROGRAMS- TO BOTH. OF PREVENT OUR PEOPLE FROM INITIATING TOBACCO AND ALSO HELPED PEOPLE WHO UNFORTUNATELY EVERY BEEN CAUGHT. IN NICOTINE EXPOSURE AN ADDICTION TO HELP THEM SO THAT THEY CAN HELP THEM IN THEIR LIVES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. OKAY WE WILL NOW- OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- SO AS THE IF YOU CAN- ITS USE YOUR SELF WITH YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION IF YOU HAVE ONE AND- ASKED IF YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENT TO A MINUTE OUR LESSON OF COURSE WE ALWAYS HAPPY TO TAKE WRITTEN. THAT TESTIMONY AND MATERIAL YOU CAN HAVE THOSE TO THE SERGEANTS SO WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN CENTER. UP THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME'S DOCTOR SILVER FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT THE DATA SHOWS THAT THESE ARE TWO INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED EPIDEMICS. OF CANNABIS AND- TOBACCO VAPING. VAPING C. T. H. C. IS NOW FOURTEEN POINT 3% OF TWELFTH GRADERS THREE POINT 5% DAILY. OUR APPROACH HAS FAILED TO REGULATE THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MIMIC JUL. IN THE CANNABIS MARKET INCLUDING VASTLY INCREASED POTENCY. FLAVORED PRODUCTS PRODUCTS LIKE PACKS MANGO THAT SOUND LIKE THEY'RE FLAVORED- AS WELL AS THE ISSUE OF HARMFUL ADDITIVES. WE NEED TO DEVELOP BOTH THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE IN THROUGH THE STATE. A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT IS COHERENT ACROSS TOBACCO. AND CANNABIS WE CAN'T SOLVE THIS BY ADDRESSING. JUST ONE AND WE HOPE TO COUNT ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE TO ALSO PROVIDE ITS LEADERSHIP THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY KELLY BEAM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE- SUPPORT CURRENT. USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS- ACROSS DIFFERENT MODES OF- APPROACH SO INCLUDING THE NEW TOBACCO TAX. ARE THE VAPING TAX AND THE STATEWIDE FLAVOR BAND AND THEN ALSO I'M EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND ENFORCEMENT- WE- YOU KNOW WE'RE HOPE. HOPING THE NEW TAX BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON LEVELS OF NICOTINE IN THE PRODUCT AND NOT JUST PER POD. THAT ITWILL HELP TO REGULATE THE AMOUNT OF NICOTINE INDUSTRY IS ABLE TO LOAD THEM WITH AND MAYBE THEY WILL BE USE AS A CESSATION DEVICE IF THEY ARE.
