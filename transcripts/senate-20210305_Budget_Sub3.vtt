00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:31.283
PANDEMIC WE NEED TO BE SURE

00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:33.685
THAT WE- SUBSTANTIALLY.

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:35.320
STRENGTH AND IT'S- NOT JUST FOR

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:37.089

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:48.500
THEY HAD READ SIX HUNDRED

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:49.801
SOMETHING PAGES LAST NIGHT OR

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.803
SOMETHING SO- BUT BUT WE'LL SEE

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.638
WHAT HAPPENS THERE I ALSO MAKE

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:55.574
NOTE THAT- YOU KNOW WE IS A

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.376

WHICH IS AT ACTUALLY BEEN VERY

00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:09.988
SUCCESSFUL IN FACT THE LAST TWO

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:11.857
YEARS WE'VE REDUCED PREMIUM

00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:13.158
INCREASES OCCURRED CALIFORNIA

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.559
OF INCREASED BY LESS THAN ONE

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:18.063
PERCENT- SO- SO CERTAINLY- I

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.032
THINK- HOPEFULLY AGAIN- THERE

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:22.667
MAY BE ELEMENTS IN THE FEDERAL

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:25.570

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:26.938
STAKEHOLDER REQUESTS IN TERMS

00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:28.507
OF- MODIFICATION TERMS OF WHAT

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:29.508
THE STATE WOULD STILL NEED TO

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:30.876
DO TO DO THAT BUT SOMEHOW I

00:23:30.942 --> 00:23:31.843
KEEP AN EYE ON THAT BECAUSE

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:32.577
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN

00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:34.479
DOING. THE ONE THAT DROPPED

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:36.615
THAT OFF- I WOULD ALSO MAKE

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:44.122
NOTE. THAT- THE SENATE HAS. IT

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:46.491
HAS. PETER LEE- PAST- AND

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:47.926
PROPOSE IN OUR BY- COVER FOR

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:49.561
AND I. SENIOR SO- YOU KNOW KNOW

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:50.295
THAT'S HOPEFULLY WE WILL CAN.

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:52.297
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:55.400
THEN- FINALLY- SO MAKE NOTE

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:58.036
THAT- IS WE TRY TO ADDRESS THE

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.771
ISSUES OF STRUCTURAL RACISM AND

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:03.441
RACISTS- AND- EQUITY THAT- IF

00:24:03.508 --> 00:24:04.843
THE BUDGET IS A- STATE OF OUR

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.045
PRIORITIES- IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.547
SIMPLY DECLARE RACISM PUBLIC

00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:09.781
HEALTH CRISIS WE NEED TO PUT

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:11.183
RESOURCES BEHIND ADDRESSING.

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:13.051
THIS STRUCTURAL RACISM SO I

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:14.452
HOPE WE CAN. LOOK AT THAT

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:42.151
HEARING A LOT ABOUT- THE

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:43.619
VACCINE AND PEOPLE ARE USING

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:45.420
THE LANGUAGE VACCINE. AND I

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.256
FEEL COMPELLED TO SAY THAT THIS

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.191
IS NOT A TRUE VACCINE IT IS

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.659
MRNA TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.628
EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:55.097
ONLY. TRADITIONAL VACCINES

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.031
CONTAIN CHOPPED UP PIECES OF

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.900
THE VIRUS SO THAT THE RECIPIENT

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.034
CAN GET IMMUNITY WITHOUT

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:01.303
GETTING THE DISEASE. THE MRNA

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.372
CODE VACCINE CONTAINS GENETIC

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:04.673
SOFTWARE THAT CAUSES THE

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.510
THE NTIGEN ON THEIR OWN WHICH

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:09.611
THEY HOPE BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:11.413
YET. WELL THEN CAUSE AN IMMUNE

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.148
RESPONSE IT'S A COOL IDEA BUT

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:14.249
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS OR

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:17.653
NOT. BOTH ARE UNPROVEN AND HAVE

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:18.854
NOT COMPLETED CLINICAL TRIALS.

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:19.688
BECAUSE WHO NEEDS CLINICAL

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:21.323
TRIALS WHEN YOU HAVE THE WHOLE

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.425

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:25.527
THE FIZER AND MADERA ARE BOTH

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:27.196
MRNA TREATMENTS THEY ARE NOT

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:28.497
