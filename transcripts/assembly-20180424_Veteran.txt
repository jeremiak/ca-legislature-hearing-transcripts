CLOSE IRATE IT UP WE ARE GOING TO GO GET AHEAD AND GET STARTED BECAUSE I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL IS HERE SO WE'RE GOING TO BE STARTING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ARE FIRST. BILL PRISONER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE TO COME UP AND PRESENT. A. B. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE PLEASE. HERE. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO AS YOU ARE AWARE. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE CREATED A VETERANS DESIGNATIONS ON DRIVER'S LICENSES AND STATE ID CARDS. AND SINCE THEN HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. EYES HAD A AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE ACTUALLY THAT APPLY FOR THAT DESIGNATION FIND THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR VETERANS BENEFITS THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT. AND THAT IS LED TO OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND I IN RECEIPTS TO THOSE VETERANS SO I JUST KIND OF A A TOOL. PURPOSE TO THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WAY. UNFORTUNATELY THE PARTICIPATION RATE IN THAT PROGRAM IS STILL VERY LOW LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE APPLIED FOR THIS DESIGNATION AND PART OF THE REASON IS THAT THERE'S A FEE ATTACHED TO. THE DESIGNATION IT'S ONLY FIVE DOLLARS BUT IT IS AN IMPEDIMENT. SO LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA AUTHORED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EXEMPT LOW INCOME ON HOMELESS VETERANS FROM HAVING TO PAY THAT FEE AND THIS BILL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE. BUILDS ON THAT SUCCESS BY EXEMPTING SENIOR CITIZENS WHO ARE ALSO VETERANS FROM HAVING TO PAY THE FEE SO THE HOPE IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO. A HIGHER PARTICIPATION RATE AND AT THE SAME TIME HELP THESE VETERANS GET THE DESIGNATION AND THE BENEFITS THAT THEY ARE VERY ENTITLED TO. VERY GOOD AND OTHER SPEAKERS IN SPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SET THREE WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD HELP WITH. ATTRACTING VETERANS TO GET TO CBS OFFICES. AND FIND BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. OUR CLIENTS THAT CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS FACTIONS COUNCIL IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU I THINK ANY OTHER SPEAKERS AND SPARK. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR DAHLE I'M GONE HARPER WITH AMERICAN LEGION DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA. WE WERE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS LIVING IN THIS GREAT STATE. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND HOPE YOU'LL. DO I VOTE ON IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COLONEL LORNA GREECE REPRESENTING MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COUNCIL WITH CHAPTERS WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. ACTION AND LORRAINE PLASS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ALSO. GOOD AFTERNOON EMPTYING GOTHAM I'M THE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL OF VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. AS YOU KNOW WE ARE ONLY AND. SUBCOMMITTEE BUT OF PERHAPS HAVE SOME FINAL WORDS. APARTMENT YOU HAVE ANY FINAL. BUT WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME COMES APPRECIATED AYE VOTE THIS IS A VERY SMALL WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU TO. ALL THE FOLKS WHO GAVE SUCH A LARGE SACRIFICE TO OUR COUNTRY AND I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE TO WAIVE THE FEE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I COMPLETELY AGREE AND THEN AND THAT THE RECOMMENDATION IS GOING TO BE DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS AS SOON AS WE GET A QUORUM THANK YOU MANAGER ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR JUST LET ME CHOI MIN I THINK IT'S A. OF REALLY FABULOUS IDEA THAT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS BILL AND A. VERY WORTHWHILE AND ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM I'LL BE HAPPY TO MAKE THE MOTION A TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. VENTURA ARE ALRIGHT. WELL I AS YOU ARE NOT EXCUSE YET. MISTER FRAZIER. EGGMAN INSURANCE ROUGHLY THEY PRESENCE. UP MISTER OBERNOLTE AS THE CHAIR TRANSPORTATION YOU AND I HAVE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ADDITION. OF THE REMAINDER OF THE VETERAN POPULATION DO. THIS SAME FAVOR. WHAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. I I IT IS UNITED CAST I AM IN FULL AGREEMENT THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO EXEMPT EVERYONE FROM HAVING TO PAY THIS FEE. THE INDICATION THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THAT WOULD ARE REDUCE OUR CHANCES OF GETTING A PASSED. I AND SO I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT HALF A LOAF BUT WE'VE DONE THE MATH AND OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF. THE VETERANS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS DESIGNATION ARE ALSO SIXTY TWO AN OVER SO THIS IS LITERALLY HALF A LOAF THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO ACCEPT IT FOR OVER. HALF OF THEM AND I WOULD LOVE TO REVISIT THIS. MAYBE NEXT YEAR WITH YOU AND. AND AND MAYBE TRYING TO WAY WITH THE FEE ALTOGETHER WELL AND COULD YOU KNOW I'VE LEARNED THAT MY COMMITTEE BASED ON THE. WILLINGNESS TO DO SO NOW YOU'RE SAYING NO. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M NOT I MIGHT PULL BACK INTO MY COMMITTEE AND HOLD. A BASED ON THAT THAT PROMISE THAT YOU HAD MADE ME. SO YOU KNOW AGAIN HERE I'VE ANOTHER WHACK AT THE APPLE LATE THIS IS WHAT I WANT. GOING FORWARD. YOU'VE MADE THE DECISION TO CHANGE YOUR MIND BECAUSE OF. THE ABILITY. THAT IT POSSIBLY WE GET OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS BASED ON THAT YOU MADE A COMMITMENT TO ME. AS THE CHAIR. AND SO. I'M GONNA VOTE NO TODAY. AND I URGE OTHER MEMBERS TO VOTE NO TODAY BASED ON THE CHAIRMAN ALLOWING A BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE. HUNTER PROMISE FROM A MEMBER AND THEN NOT HOLDING UP. HIS END OF THE BARGAIN. TO TRY TO SAVE HIS BILL. THAT BEING SAID. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT. I WILL GIVE YOU A YES VOTE TODAY NOT PULL BACK INTO MY COMMITTEE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE. MISS UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION TO BREAK A PROMISE THAT I MADE YOU. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO. TO COMMIT TO TAKING AMENDMENT TO EXTENDED TO ALL VETERANS. WITH THAT SAID ARE ALL EXPECT TO SEE IT IN APPROPRIATIONS THE AMENDMENTS MADE. AND THEN RESERVE JUDGMENT ON THE FLOOR AS I HAVE. NOW WITH THAT I WILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR I'M DOING THAT BECAUSE. I WOULD NEVER WANT TO GO BACK A COMMITMENT THAT I MADE THAT MATTERS A LOT MORE TO ME THAN A YES OR A NO VOTE. UNDERSTAND AND THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING OF OUR AGREEMENT. ALL RIGHT. WE STILL DO NOT OH YES. STIR VOEPEL NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT WAS. BUT I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO TELL EVERYONE HERE THAT THIS IS A VERY GOOD BILL. AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS. MANY OF US VETERANS RECEIVE DISCOUNTS ONE WE SHOW OUR VETERANS DRIVER'S LICENSE WITH VETERANS ON IT THAT'S OUR ID. YOU GET TEN PERCENT OFF AT LOWE'S YOU GET. PERCENTS OFF AT HOME DEPOT. VETERANS AT THE AIRPORT GET TEN PERCENT OFF OF WHAT THEY PURCHASE AT MOST PLACES SO WE'RE TALKING OF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TEN PERCENT FIFTEEN PERCENT DISCOUNTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. VOLUNTARILY GIVEN TO VETERANS IF. YOU PRODUCE. YOU'RE. VETERAN. DRIVERS LICENSE SO THIS IS ACTUALLY. VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY TO HOMELESS VETERANS LOW INCOME VETERANS VETERANS ON DISABILITY. IF YOU'RE A HUNDRED PERCENT DISABLED VETERAN YOU ONLY GET TWENTY TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SOME CHANGE A MONTH THAT'S BARELY ENOUGH TO LIVE ON. SO THESE DISCOUNTS AND THIS ID IS WORTH IT LITERALLY WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD. AND IT CAN ACTUALLY HELP PUT AN EXTERMINATOR FOOD ON THE TABLE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I AM SO GLAD HE TOOK THE AMENDMENT. SIR. EVERY VETERAN SHOULD GET IT IN YOUR EXACTLY SPOT ON. WELL MISTER VOEPEL AND AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I AM THE AUTHOR OF AB NINE THIRTY FIVE WHO IT. WHO ORIGINATED THE? AFTER MANY MANY YEARS. OF TRYING TO GET THE DESIGNATION A DRIVER'S LICENSE WITH P. COMEDY. WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DMV. AND IT WAS DRASTICALLY REDUCED FROM TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO FIVE DOLLARS. NOW FOR GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME KIND OF A DEAL IT SHOULD BE FOR ALL VETERANS GOING CLOSE BUT YOU DON'T JUST HAVE TO HAVE YOUR. VETERANS DESIGNATION TO GET THE DISCOUNT YOU CAN UTILIZE YOUR DD TWO FOURTEEN ALSO FOR IDENTIFICATION TO GET THOSE DISCOUNTS BUT. AGAIN AS A A PROUD MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE IN WANTING TO SUPPORT. OUR VETERANS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHEN I WAS PART OF THE DEAL WAS FIVE DOLLARS. NOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE ZERO IT HAS TO BE EQUITABLE FOR ALL VETERANS. TO. IT'S QUIRK SILVA YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FIRST SAYS. WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD. INTEGRAL. IRWIN. HERE VOEPEL. CHáVEZ. DALY. FRAZIER AYE. GLORIA THIS OLD. ATTENDANCE MATHIS HERE HERE. MURATSUCHI. QUIRK SILVA. SALAS HA HA THAT IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAD A ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. UP WILL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER IT FOR ORIGINATING THE BILL AS I WAS A ME TOO ON THE BILL ADDING ANOTHER AMENDMENT TO WIN THE US. TO ADD HOMELESS VETS AND SO I THINK WE ALL ARE THINKING ALIKE HERE. BUT ONE THING THAT I HAVE BROUGHT UP I HAD ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEES THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER AGREED WITH IS THAT. AS WE MAKE LEGISLATION AND WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE IT THROUGH AND GET SIGNED. WE DON'T ALWAYS. VERIFY IF IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED SO. I THINK YEAH THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT I DID ASK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF EGGMAN AND THE CHAIR OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON HOW THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE BUT I ALSO HAD ANOTHER. HOMELESS BILL FOR A FEE WAIVER JUST FOR AN ID AND MANY OF THE DMV'S OUT WHEN IT WAS AND ACTUALLY SEE ANNABEL THERE BECAUSE SHE. WAS A WILL. ON OUR TEAM AT THAT POINT WE FOUND THAT THEY WERE NOT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING IT AND TELL WE HAD TO MAKE QUITE A FUSS AND SO THIS. AGAIN. HOPING THAT IT GETS ALL THE WAY TO THE GOVERNOR AND SIGN BUT EVEN WITH THE TWO. OF BILLS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. I THINK IT'S PART OF OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DIEM THESE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN SIGNED BUT THANK YOU. PACKETS OUT DID YOU OF THE COMMENTS FRAZIER NO JUST. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE. UNBELIEVABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR VETERANS TO COME IN IT TO THEIR CV ESOS ALSO IF THE FIVE DOLLARS WAS A RESTRICTION. THIS WILL GIVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO COME IN AND SEE IF THEY QUALIFY FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. THROUGH THE FEDERAL OF GI BILL AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE AFFORDED TO THEM SO. EXPANDING THIS IN IF THERE WERE RESTRICTIONS AND WE HEARD SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FIVE DOLLARS WAS WHO WAS IMPLEMENTED. THIS WILL BE HAVE EVERYBODY THAT SAME EQUAL FOOTING TO GO OUT AND GET ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND I APPRECIATE. ALRIGHT SO I'M JUST TO BE CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE NOT TAKING AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT DO YOU HAVE MADE. YOUR COMMITMENT WITH MISTER FRAZIER MOVING FORWARD THERE IS A WE ARE VOTING RIGHT NOW ON THE BILL WITHOUT. ANY AMENDMENTS AND THE MOTION IS. A PERSON IN MOTION AND THE SECOND.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN WILL DIRECTLY REINVEST REVENUE GENERATED FROM STAFF HOUSING RENT AT THE YACHT BILL VETERANS HOME. INTO MAINTAINING THE HOME. NOT BILL VETERANS HOME IS MORE THAN A CENTURY OLD. SO IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE FACILITIES USED BY VETERANS AND STAFF. RICART REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES. LAST YEAR STAFF HOUSING GENERATE MORE THAN A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE STATE TO I CAN I JUST ASK ALL THE MEMBERS TO LOWER THEIR VOICE IS A LITTLE BECAUSE I CAN HARDLY HEAR THE SPEAKER. THE CIVIC EYELASHES STEP HOUSING GENERATED MORE THAN A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE STATE GENERAL FUND. ALTHOUGH THIS MONEY IS REQUIRED TO GO BACK TO THE VETERANS IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THE BUDGET ARGUMENTATION IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM STAFF HOUSING UP BEYOND THAT YOU DON'T BILL IS DIRECTLY RETURNED TO THE CAMPUS TO HELP CHIP AWAY AT THE BACKLOG. OF MAINTENANCE ISSUES AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN IS NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THIS BACKLOG. BUT IT WILL RESULT IN IMPROVEMENTS AT YON FILL TO BENEFIT THE FORMER SERVICE MEMBERS AND STAFF THERE. FOR THIS REASONS AS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. OUR RIGHTS SPEAKERS INSPIRED. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE NAPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE HOME THEY'RE NOT BILL IS A HUGE PART OF THE COMMUNITY. AND WHAT THE BILL SETS FORWARD JUST REINVEST IN THE HOUSING THERE THERE'S A HOUSING SHORTAGE ALREADY IN NAPA THE FIRES EXACERBATED IT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AYE AND NAPA TO TO PRESERVE THAT THE THE. HOME THERE AND TO CONTINUE INVESTING AND THE VETERANS THAT LIVE THERE AND MAKE NAPA COUNTY THEIR HOME HAS CREATE ABOUT THE QUEUE.

GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN DAWN HARPER WITH AMERICAN LEGION WHATEVER MONIES RAISED AN EYEBROW SHOULD STAY YOUNG BILL SO HUNDRED THOUSAND LEGIONNAIRES AGREE WITH THIS I HOPE YOU'LL BE WITH US WITH US AS WELL THANK YOU. LARA GREECE REPRESENTING MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF CHAPTERS AND WE SUPPORT THE BILL. LORRAINE PLASS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS STATE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR WE SUPPORT THIS. VERY GOOD AND THE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL MISTER FRAZIER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FANTASTIC BILL THANK YOU FOR THE STUNT STARTING PROCESS WAS THE BACKLOG. OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON OH YELP HELP. OUT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THEM AMOUNT LET'S JUST PUT THE SO WHAT REALLY CAME TO MIND IS WHEN WE WERE THERE VISITING. AND THERE'S A A NOTE ON THE WATER FAUCET THE SAYS LET THE WATER RUN FIVE MINUTES BEFORE DRINKING. THE OTHER WAS AN EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLD GENTLEMAN WHO DIDN'T HAVE HEAT IN HIS APARTMENT. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNCALLED FOR THERE'S SO MUCH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT WHY THIS MONEY HAS ME RETURNED. A WE NEED TO DO. INVESTIGATE WHAT THE HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH THAT HUNTER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS COOLEY START WITH SOME BASIC MAINTENANCE SUMMERS UPON US THEY NEED TO BE WITH HIM AND NEW AIR CONDITIONING UNITS. RUNNING WATER I MEAN IT IT CAN GO ON AND ON IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY WHICH WE TREASURE IT IN OF NAPA COUNTY. AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH US. NO ABSOLUTELY AND AGAIN I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND. IS A LIST OF ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE REPAIRED. TO BE ABLE TO RESPECT OUR VETERANS AND YOU DON'T FEEL AND THEIR CARE. AND THAT WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE AS AS THE LEGISLATURE TO TO SUPPORT. THE NEED THROUGH THE BUDGET OR ONE OF THEIR OTHER WHATEVER PROCESS WE CAN. CAN COME TO. SO THAT'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAVEZ. YES. I GREW TO PLACE DEFTLY KNEES LA TO HELP CLOSELY IF YOU LOOK AT THE. EVER STRUCTURE THERE'S A STUDY DONE. EIGHT YEARS AGO. ON THE NEED JUSTIN CLIMBING IN SEWERS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THE. PLACE NEEDS WORK AND MANY OF SELL THESE AS FAR AS THE ROOMS THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN A ROOM. DOESN'T MEET NEARLY TO STANDARD WE HAVE A SAY IN LAS ANGELES OF THE DEFTLY NO DOUBT ABOUT IT NEEDS. MIKE MY BIG CONCERN IS ALWAYS. THAT THE. GIVEN THE FULL AUTHORITY TO JANVIER IS THERE IS THERE ANY OVERSIGHT OR THE ABILITY OF THE SECRETARY TO. BALLOT SAID ON THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE THAT WASN'T THERE WAS A INVESTIGATION AND AUDIT. ON THE ADMINISTRATORS OF YACHT BILL BEFORE. BECAUSE OF. AND ELIOT MAGISTRATE IS THERE. ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE THERE FOR MEDICAL CARE. THEY'RE NOT REALLY THERE FOR. INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE. AND. AND ORIGINALLY ONE YACHT DOES ESTABLISHING EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WAS SEEN AS THIS COMMAND ELEMENT. BUT WE STATUS ARE GONE FORWARD. WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR YOM WILL GET THE SAME AS ADMINISTRATOR AND BEEN TERM TAKES CARE OF A COUPLE HUNDRED VETERANS. AND SO CLEARLY THAT THE PAY STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT. I MEAN THE REQUIREMENT OVERSIGHT DIFFERENT BUT THE PAY STRUCTURES SAME AND THE SKILL LEVELS COMING IN AT A YACHT BILL COULD BE THE ONE TO SAME SKILL LEVEL INVENTOR. WHICH IS A NEW FACILITY SO. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT DEBT REALLY WOULD PUT SOME RESPONSIBILITY ON THE SECRETARY. SO HOW DID HOUSES SECRETARY. DISALLOWED THE SECRETARY AND HIS STAFF TO. AND SURE THAT WE SPEND THE MONEY WISELY. I DO KNOW THAT THEY JUST RECENTLY HIRED A GENTLEMAN THIS CAN BE WORKING ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AT THE SITE I'M I THINK THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS NUMEROUS COMMITTEE MEETINGS UP AT THE. AT THE SITE. TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S OUR NEXT STEP SHOULD BE. AND THERE'S BEEN A MASTER PLAN THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE. THERE'S BEEN SOME FUNDING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH A NEW. FACILITY. WE HAVE. RESIDENTS THAT LIVE THERE THAT% SHOULD BE CITY LIVING IN SINGLE BEDROOMS NOT HAVING TO SHARE WITH OTHERS. SO THERE'S A LOT TO GO ON OF ITS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THEIR. I'M WORKING ALSO WITH CONGRESSMAN THOMPSON ON THIS AND SENATOR DODD. AS WELL AS A A LOCAL SUPERVISORS AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PLACE STAYS NAPA COUNTY. THAT OUR RESIDENTS GET THE BEST OF CARE. AND. IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO ME IS THAT. WE'VE HAD A TOUGH TIME UP THERE RECENTLY AND I THINK WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO GET THIS PLACE BACK ON HIS FEET. IT IS A GEM FOR A NAPA COUNTY IN AS WELL AS FOR THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE THERE. THE STAFF NEEDS A STATE SAFE PLACE TO WORK AND RIGHT NOW I QUESTION IF THEY'RE REALLY SAFE AS WELL. AND I SCREWED IT ALL THAT BUT I'M READING YOUR BILL THIS IS ALL REVENUE GENERATED FROM PLOY HOUSING ON THE CAMPUS. OF THE VETERAN HOME OF YOUNG MALES SHALL BE DEPOSITED. IN A FUND. MAINTAINED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR THE HOME. AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE A CONCERN BECAUSE. WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT BEFORE AND I HAVE KIDS. YEAH AND I HAVE A CONCERN OVER THAT. SO THAT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID UNDER THE SENATE VERY WELL I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE OVERSIGHT ISSUE. AND I WOULD I AGREE WITH HIM LET'S WORK ON SOMETHING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ADD THAT TO THE BILL. SURE WE'RE REALLY RIGHT ON THE MONEY WHERE IS THAT GOING TO HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE GETS DISPERSED. AND SEE HOW IT GOES BUT I AM I AGREE WITH YOU. EXECUTIVE MAYBE AMEND THAT ONE COMPONENT BRING IN THE SECRETARY TO GIVE THEM. AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT AS I SAID SAID THE MINISTRY OF THE HOMES A WONDERFUL PERSON BUT TO THEIR FOR MEDICAL REASONS. NOT FOR ENGINEERING AND YOU KNOW WAYS MANAGER AND AND. AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT. AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO BE YOU WANT THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THE VETERAN SO. I JUST THINK THAT ONE LINE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED NOW TO BE VERY SUPPORTIVE IF THAT WAS JUST. WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH HIM ON THAT ABSOLUTELY. I AGREE. WHAT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER? COMES FROM THE PANEL. I'M SORRY TO BE SO LONG WINDED TODAY BUT DO AFTER TOURING THE FACILITY IN AGAIN YOU MENTIONED HOW PEOPLE ARE DOUBLED UP HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN BETTER DORM ROOMS IN UC'S AND I HAVE FOR THE FOR VETERANS. YOU KNOW IT AND AGAIN IT ALMOST WORKED IS REMINISCENT OF SOME OF THE OLD JAILS. HOW WE WE STACK THEM LIKE CORD WOOD I THINK THAT WITH EIGHT THEY DESERVE BETTER? AND. SO I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CONCENTRATION ALSO HOW WE CAN. CHANGE THAT THAT CULTURE OF US STACKING PEOPLE UP IN AND GIVING THEM THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. ONE IDEA TO CHANGE A CULTURE I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TODAY IN IDENTIFIES THAT THERE'S A NEW GROUP OF. OFFICE. SOLDIERS COMING IN ARE. COMING VETERANS ARE COMING BACK. AND THERE A LOT MORE WOMEN. AND THERE'S A LOT MORE DIFFERENT. NEEDS THAT THEY NEED PTSD I'M IS A LOT DIFFERENT NOT THAT IT WASN'T BEFORE BUT WE IT'S NOT AGING COMMUNITY. AND THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN REALIZE WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR NEW VETERANS. AND MAKE SURE THEY GET THE ATTENTION THAT THEY DESERVE AS WELL. RIGHT DO WE HAVE MOTION. SECOND. SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER IN THE SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOLACE AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. IRWIN. I'VE IRWIN AYE VOEPEL. VOEPEL AYE CHAVEZ.
