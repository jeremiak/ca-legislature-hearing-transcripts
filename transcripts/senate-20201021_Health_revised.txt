SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN JEOPARDY WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO WELCOME AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. IN THE DECADE AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER UNDER. IN THE STATE BY OVER HALF. ESTABLISH CALIPHATES. COVERED CALIFORNIA WHICH PROVIDES AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND ALLOWED MANY CALIFORNIANS TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. PROVIDE VALUABLE PROTECTIONS TO PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS INCLUDING ELIMINATING LIFETIME LIMITS THE COVERAGE ALLOWING CHILDREN TO STAY ON THE PARENTS HEALTH PLAN. AND SLOW THE RATE OF GROWTH OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS PARTICULARLY IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. I THINK IT'S- APPROPRIATE TO SAY A BIT ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE THE ACA SINCE IT'S BEEN OVER TEN YEARS SINCE WE IMPLEMENTED IT. BACK THEN WE HAD INSURANCE PREMIUMS PARTICULARLY FOR INDIVIDUALS SKYROCKETING. AS MANY INDIVIDUALS THAT PIECE OF THE CONDITIONS EITHER COULD NOT PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE OR ONLY AT EXORBITANT RATES. WE SAW PEOPLE WHO HAD PAID FOR INSURANCE FOR YEARS AND THEN WHEN THEY FINALLY FELL ILL. WE'RE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR INSURANCE YOU ALSO HAD PEOPLE WHO HAD CONDITIONS IN WHICH- BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF THE TREATMENT. INSURANCE BECAUSE A LIFETIME COVERAGE ESSENTIALLY ENDED WHILE THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE THEIR TREATMENT. AND YOU HAD FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN WERE GOING OFF TO COLLEGE AND YET BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT IN THE WORK FORCE. WE'RE UNABLE TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT STAY ON THEIR PARENTS PLAN. SO THIS AND MANY OTHER REASONS WERE WHAT DROVE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA. NOW AS AFTER THE DEBATE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA. I THINK MANY PEOPLE OVER TIME RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IN FACT IN MANY STATES. WHO DIDN'T INITIALLY ADOPTED THE MEDICAID EXPANSIONS IN THE ACA. EVEN DESPITE THE RESISTANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S HE PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY PASSED INITIATIVES IN THOSE STATES TO IMPLEMENT. EXPANSIONS OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AND OTHER TYPES OF CHANGES AS WELL. HOWEVER MORE RECENTLY THERE'S A REPUBLICAN LAWSUIT SUPPORT BY PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT THREATENS TO OVERTURN THE ACA. AND ELIMINATE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR ALL THE GAINS THAT WERE DESCRIBED. CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHERS HAVE APPEALED TO THE US SUPREME COURT WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO HEAR THE CASE ON NOVEMBER TENTH. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF TRUMP SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF THE REPUBLICAN LAWSUIT DURING THE WORST PANDEMIC IN THE CENTURY. THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH WILL HEAR FROM EXPERTS AS- AND WHAT AN ADVERSE RULING BY THE SUPREME COURT MEANS FOR CALIFORNIA. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL. SO OUR FIRST SPEAKER IN THE FIRST PANEL. OF SPEAKERS IN OUR FIRST PANEL ART DEBRA READY COACH. AND MELANIE FONTES RAINER WHO IS SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. OF LET'S FIRST BEGIN WITH- DEBRA CULTURES IN INVENTING CONSULT AND AN EX. ON THE PORTABLE CARE ACT. THE WRECKAGE. THANK YOU SENATOR- I HOPE YOU CAN SEE THE SLIDES. YOU HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I'M A RETIRED INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT AND FORMER LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS AND I JUST APPRECIATE THAT THIS HEARING IS HAPPENING HELLO KIM HM MINE HE. IT'S NOT LETTING ME. WORK THE SCIENCE. I MEAN IT. IT WORKED I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. IS THERE ANYBODY THAT CAN HELP BECAUSE I'M I'M JUST UNABLE TO PAGE DOWN AS IT WAS WORKING JUST FINE THIS MORNING. THE AREA OKAY OKAY IT LOOKS LIKE THAT OKAY THANK YOU YEAH SORRY SO I JUST WANTED TO START BY SAYING THAT- THE STRAINS OF THE ACA- AS YOU SAID SENATOR IS THAT IT'S REALLY COMPREHENSIVE SO IT'S NOT JUST. A COUPLE OF COVERAGE PROGRAMS IT'S THAT PLUS- YOU KNOW SUPPORT FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME INDIVIDUALS TO PURCHASE COVERAGE. INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS THAT GO ACROSS MARKETS INDIVIDUAL SMALL GROUP AND LARGE GROUP ALSO AFFORDABILITY ACCESSIBILITY TRANSPARENCY EASE OF USE FOR CONSUMERS. PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION PROMOTING PREVENTION WELLNESS AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SO IT'S SO MUCH THAT IS AT STAKE. THE FEDERAL ACA. STRUCTURE INCLUDES THE COVERAGE- ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE CONSUMER INSURANCE PROTECTIONS AND ALSO HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT QUALITY AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND IT MADE VERY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO MEDICARE INCLUDING PAYMENT REFORMS AND CLOSING. THE GAP IN THE MEDICARE PART D. PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM ALL THESE AT POTENTIAL RISK THE COVERAGE FRAMEWORK ITSELF IS- REVOLVES AROUND MEDICAID EXPANSION AS YOU SAID MEDIC CAL IN CALIFORNIA MARKET REFORMS EXCHANGES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES BOTH FOR INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS THIS CHART REALLY SHOWS THE EXTENT OF THE PROOF THE INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS AND ALSO SHOWS THAT IT DOES APPLY- TO ALL MARKETS NOT MANY OF THEM DO APPLY- NOTABLY COVERAGE FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES WITH NO COST SHARING AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER THOUGH THE ANNUAL AND LIFETIME LIMITS. BEING PROHIBITED AND SO BEFORE THE ACA WE HAD IT ON AND RATE OF UNINSURED AROUND 20% FOR DECADES- I THINK WE HAD A MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT ONLY SERVES CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND WAS PARTICULARLY COMPLEX IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT. WE HAVE THIS VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET THAT WAS YOU EUPHEMISTICALLY DUBBED THE WILD WILD WEST WITH VERY FEW ROLES AND MINIMAL STATE OVERSIGHT. CALIFORNIANS COULD EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION JOB LUCK JOB LOCK AND DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR HEALTH CARE IF THEY CHANGE JOBS OR EXPERIENCE OTHER LIFE CHANGES CALIFORNIA WENT ALL IN AND WE NOT ONLY EMBRACED ALL ASPECTS OF THE ACA BUT WE ALSO PRESERVED AND BUILT ON OUR OWN TREATS- PREVIOUS CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AND EXPANDED COVERAGE. WE HAD THEM CAL. WITH THE WENT ON TO. ON THAT WITH M. STATE FUNDED COMPREHENSIVE MEDICARE UP TO LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND SENIORS WE'LL HEAR ABOUT COVER CALIFORNIA FROM MR LEE- WE ALSO INVESTED HEAVILY AND WROTE OUT REGION WRONG THEN AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO GET SIGNED UP. AND THEN WE WENT BEYOND THE ACA WITH THINGS LIKE STANDARDIZED BENEFITS THAT HELP INDIVIDUALS. SEARCH AFFECTIVELY AND COMPARED THEIR- POTENTIAL COVERAGE OFTEN OPTIONS. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT A PRE ACA INDIVIDUAL MARKET I THINK OF IT AS- THE POTENTIAL FOR. CALIFORNIANS TO GET STYMIED ALONG THE WAY EITHER AS THEY WERE APPLYING FOR COVERAGE AND BEING DENIED BECAUSE OF THEIR HEALTH STATUS AND THIS IS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WE THINK OF CANCER DIABETES HEART DISEASE- BUT PREGNANCY WAS A PRE EXISTING CONDITION AND ALSO- INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD PAST ILLNESSES EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE RESOLVED THAT COULD BE A CAUSE FOR THEM GETTING TONIGHT AND OF COURSE WE THINK. AS WE ARE LOOKING AT IT THAT CO THAT EVENTUALLY WILL BE A HIGH A PRE EXISTING CONDITION- THEY CAN ALSO BE STYMIED AS THEY SOUGHT COVERAGE YOU MIGHT BE GET COVERAGE BUT THEN THE RATES COULD SKYROCKET. IF THEY HAD ANY KIND OF- HEALTH ISSUE AND THEN ONCE THEY SECURED COVERAGE THE BENEFITS MIGHT BE LIMITED FOR EXAMPLE EXCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH OR ADDICTION TREATMENT OR EXCLUDING THOSE VERY SPECIFIC THING THEY NEEDED BECAUSE- IT WAS A REFLECTION OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED EARLIER. SO SALUTING THEIR FOOT ANYTHING. TO DO WITH THEIR FOOT AS AN EXAMPLE THE POSTINGS END OF THE MARKET ADDRESSED ALL THREE OF THESE AREAS. THE REQUIRING EVERYONE TO GET COVERAGE- ELIMINATING THE ABILITY OF HEALTH PLANS TO RATE UP BASED ON HEALTH STATUS AND ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE ANNUAL AND LIFETIME DOLLAR LIMITS. SO AGAIN THIS IS JUST ME SAYING AND IT'S SORT OF BECOME KIND OF A ONE LINER COVER PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS BUT IT'S NOT A ONE LINER IS A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT STARTS WHEN YOU APPLY AND GOES ALL THE WAY UNTIL YOU RECEIVE BENEFITS. HEALTH STATUS IS NO LONGER A FACTOR. SO AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER WE SUCCESSFULLY DROPPED OUR UNINSURED RATE IN HALF. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT. THE OVERALL RESULT IS THAT THE ACA MORE CALIFORNIANS CAN STAY COVERED WHEN THEY CHANGE JOBS HAVE A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES OR OTHERWISE LOSE COVERAGE AND MANY. CAN GET FINANCIAL HELP IF THEY QUALIFY JUST A NOTE- ON THE STE THE IMPACTS ON EQUITY THAT- WE CAN SEE FROM THE ACA SO ALL. RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS- FOUND IMPROVED HEALTH INSURANCE RATES WITH THE LATINO IS EXPERIENCING THE LARGEST REDUCTION AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AS WELL AS THE SENATE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGION SAW SIGNIFICANT DECLINES THAT WE HAVE TO MENTION MUST MENTION THAT DESPITE THESE IMPROVEMENTS. THERE ARE STILL SOME VERY SERIOUS HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE RATE OF AN INSURANCE. AMONG NON WHITE POP. COMPARED TO WHITE POPULATIONS SO ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT'S AT STAKE IS WHAT WE CAN SEE IS THAT THE ACA MADE VERY DRAMATIC CHANGES IN VIRTUALLY ALL AREAS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COVERAGE. THE UC BERKELEY LABORCENTER ESTIMATES THAT CALIFORNIA COULD END ONLY ANNUALLY LOSE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION AND THEY JUST CAME OUT WITH. INTENSELY TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND JOBS IF THE ACA WAS REPEALED ARE STRUCK DOWN. AND SO REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY CALIFORNIA STANDS TO LOSE MATCH OF THE HISTORIC GAINS IT MADE IN THINKING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW REALLY IN LESS THAN A DECADE REALLY QUITE ASTONISHING GIVING OUR HISTORY PRIOR TO THE ACA. IMPROVING ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR ME. OKAY THANK YOU I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL THEN MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND SPEAKER- AND THEN WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO NEXT- WE HAVE ON THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE ACA MELANIE FOSTER RAINER- WITH A SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WELCOME HI THANK YOU DR HANNAH NUMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US HAVING ME HERE TODAY. AND MY NAME IS MELANIE FONTANA RAINER I'M A SPECIAL ASSISTANT HERE ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. ETCETERA AND JUST A QUICK UPDATE ON SORT OF WHERE WE ARE THE LEGAL LEGAL MATTERS BEHIND THIS CASE- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SEVERAL OTHER AND STATES RED STATES TEXAS. INTO INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS FILED A LAWSUIT DECLARE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND INVALID- THEY ASSERTED THAT WITH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN PASSAGE OF THE REPUBLICAN TAX LAW- ALSO KNOWN AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. OF WHICH STYLE DOWN THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY TO ZERO DOLLARS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS NO LONGER CONSTITUTIONAL AND AS A RESULT SINCE THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE LAW ARE TIED TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THAT ALL THE OTHER PROVISIONS INCLUDING THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS MUST FALL- THE ARGUMENT RELIES- SOLELY ON THE SUPREME COURT'S TWENTY TWELVE DECISION IN THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS VERSUS A BILIOUS R. AND F. ID. IN THAT DECISION A FIVE JUSTICE MAJORITY OF THE SUPREME COURT HELD THE ACA'S INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHICH REQUIRED PEOPLE TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE OR MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE IRS. BEFORE REACHING THAT CONCLUSION THE COURT REASONED THAT IF THE MANDATE WERE READ AS A COMMANDS. IT WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT THE COURT FOR THE REASON THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A TAX. THAT IS NEARLY TAX OF THOSE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN CONGRESS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THAT TAX ZERO DOLLARS BUT LACKS THE ACTUAL TAX AND LANGUAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE- ON THE BOOKS. WHICH PROVIDES THE INDIVIDUALS SHALL MAINTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND REPUBLICAN LED STATES EMBRACE THIS IDEA THAT. THE AC WAS INVALID- AN ACTION THAT WAS SO OUT OF THE ORDINARY ATTORNEYS AT U. S. DOJ RESIGNED AND TOOK THEIR. NAMES OFF OF THE LEGAL BRIEFS. CALIFORNIA'S LEAD COLOR OF TO ONE STAY THAT. VERY EARLY IN THIS CASE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A PARTY DEFENDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND HEALTH CARE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES INTERVENE IN THE CASE FOR THE SAME REASON. THE DISTRICT COURT ACCEPTED THE PLAINTIFFS ARGUMENTS. AND THE COURT OF APPEAL ACCEPTED THE ARGUMENT THAT THE MANDATE IS NOW UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT DID NOT DECIDE AS TO WHETHER THE REST OF THE ACA SHOULD FALL IN WAS INVALID. OUR COALITION ASKED THE SUPREME COURT TO HEAR THE CASE IN JANUARY. AND THE COURT GRANTED OUR REQUEST. ON AND I'M A MEMBER TENTH CALIFORNIA SOLICITOR GENERAL MICHAEL MUNGAN WILL BE ARGUING THE CASE ON OUR BEHALF. CALIFORNIA HAS PRESENTED THREE ARGUMENTS WHY I BELIEVE WE SHOULD WHEN THIS CASE FIRST WE ARGUE THAT NO PLAINTIFF IN THIS CASE HAS STANDING TO FILE THIS LAWSUIT. STANDING AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IS THE BASIC IDEA THAT A PERSON CAN CHALLENGE A LOT IN COURTS. AND MUST SHOW THAT THE LAW CAUSES HIM OR HER SOME INJURY. HERE THAT YOU INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS HAVE NO. HARM BECAUSE THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE- SO A PENALTY OF ZERO DOLLARS NO HARM THERE'S NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE. FURTHER ON THE STATES THAT HAVE SUED. ARE NOW NOT BURDEN AND ALSO NOT HARMS BY ZERO DOLLAR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE- SECOND WE ARGUE THAT WHAT IS LEFT OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE REMAINS CONSTANT CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO DIAL UP AND DIAL DOWN. ON TAXES AND THEY DO THAT OFTEN AND SO IN THE SAME WAY THAT THEY DIAL DOWN THE MEDICAL DEVICE TAX AT ONE POINT. THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DIAL DOWN THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY TAX- AND THAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL NOT AS WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW- AND LAST EVEN IF THE COURT DECIDES NOW THAT THE TOOTHLESS INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ZERO DOLLAR PENALTY IS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT IT SEVERABLE FROM THE REST OF THE ECA. THIS LEGAL DOCTRINE ASKED WHETHER IF ONE PROVISIONAL LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE LAW MUST ALSO BE HELD BALLOT. THIS BOILS DOWN TO A QUESTION OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT. WHETHER IF CONGRESS HAD KNOWN THAT ONE PROVISION OF THE LOT IT DOC DID WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IT WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO KEEP THE REST OF THE LAW OR SCRAP IT ENTIRELY. HERE WE ARGUE THAT THE INTENT OF THE CONGRESS- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. BY GETTING RID OF THE ONLY NEGATIVE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES FOR HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE. CONGRESS VERY INTENSELY KNEW WHAT IT WAS DOING AND LEFT THE REST OF THE LAW ON THE BOOKS- AND THERE ARE MANY STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE- WHERE IT'S VERY CLEAR THIS ISN'T. EXPANSION THIS ISN'T THE PRE EXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS ASSISTANCE- SUBSIDIES ECCENTRIC SATCHER- AT THE SAME TIME CONGRESS PRESERVED EVERY OTHER FEATURE OF THE ACA CAPTAIN IN TAX- AND- WE ARGUE THAT CONGRESS IS INTACT ACTIONS IN THIS CASE ARE CONCLUSIVE PROOF. THAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN ITS PRESENT FORM IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. CONGRESS WANTED THE REST OF THE ACA TO REMAIN IN PLACE. AND THISCASE IS LEGALLY. DANGEROUS AND IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE TAKING WITH PROTECTIONS REPEAT OF PRAISE CONDITIONS MATTER X. COVER SUCH. WERE FOR. COVERAGE FOR ADULTS UP TO AGE TWENTY SIX PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTMENTS THAT HELP THE BUILDING LACKED CAPACITY. AN EPIDEMIOLOGY EFFORTS AND MORE DURING A PANDEMIC EVER PURCHASED NOW IS WRONG- WE'VE SEEN THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN BY THIS PRESIDENT WHO AND WHOSE OWN WORDS WANTS TO EXPLODE THE ECA. AND WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO FIGHT HIS SABOTAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT- WE WILL CONTINUE TO. DO THAT I'M A MEMBER TENANTS- BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK THAT HEALTH ARE SHOULD JUST BE FOR THOSE WHO ARE HEALTHY OR RICH. AND BECAUSE A MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE WHAT YOUR HEALTH CARE CONDITION IS HOW MUCH MONEY MAKER WHO LOVES. HEALTH CARE EMPOWERS US AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF US- THE CONTRAST HERE COULD NOT BE STARKER WE ARE SUPPORTED BY A BIPARTISAN COALITION OF ECONOMISTS. LEGAL SCHOLARS ATTORNEYS GENERAL MAJOR MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ADVOCATES UNIONS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS GROUPS L. G. B. T. Q. I. A. AND CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS AND OTHERS. HEALTH CARE IS ON THE LINE AND WE WILL CONTINUE EVERYTHING. WE CAN TO PROTECT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR I MUCH. SO NOW WILL TAKE ITS QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS FOR THEIR MEMBERS PARTISAN REMOTELY USAID RAISE YOUR HAND FEATURES I KNOW THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK I DO SEE CENTER MONEY HAVING MICROPHONE UP CEREMONY. ONE THANK YOU MR CHIU AND- I DO WANT TO THANK. THE CHIU THE COMMITTEE FOR ORGANIZING THIS TIMELY AND IMPORTANT HEARING. AND MY QUESTION TO. EITHER OF THE PANEL MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR- ADDITIONS TO THIS HEARING TODAY AND ESPECIALLY THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO FOR THEIR PURSUIT. OF. BEING HEARD IN THIS COURT. TO CHALLENGE THOSE WHO SEEK TO INVALIDATE THE ACA. IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE THERE'S BEEN MUCH FOCUS ON. THE ISSUE A PRE EXISTING CONDITION. AND I THINK. BOTH OF YOU HELPED OUTLINE A LITTLE FURTHE FROM WHAT WHAT COULD BE LOST OR WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A PRE EXISTING CONDITION COVERT NINETEEN PREGNANCY AT SETRA. ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE ACA THAT I THINK DOESN'T GET ENOUGH. FOCUS AND I WOULD LIKE YOUR FURTHER COMMENTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ACA IN REMOVING LIFETIME CAPS. ON INSURANCE COMPANIES OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE INSURANCE SOMEBODY SUFFERING FROM A SERIOUS ILLNESS OR DISEASE OR SERIOUS. ACCIDENT INJURIES WOULD EITHER OF CARE TO COMMENT TO LITTLE FURTHER. THE IMPORTANCE OF HOW THE ACA HAS REMOVED A LIFETIME CAPS IN WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE NOT JUST FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE BUT IN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE IF THE LIFETIME CAP REMOVAL WERE TO BE REVERSED. THANK YOU. OKAY THE CENTER I'M BE HAPPY TO TAKE A STAB AND MAYBE MELANIE ALSO HONORED. YOU RAISE A REALLY IMPORTANT- QUESTION- AND I THINK GENERALLY I WAS TRYING AND- TO REINFORCE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU SEE IS THAT ONE PROVISIONS AROUND PRE EXISTING CONDITION IS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORKS THAT MAKE SURE PEOPLE WHO. EITHER HAVE HEALTH ISSUES OR NEED HEALTH SERVICES ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST RIGHT SO THE ANNUAL AND LIFETIME LIMITS ESSENTIALLY SAID. YOU ARE COVERED. BUT YOU MAY ONLY USE- THIS MANY DOLLARS WORTH OF SERVICES IN A YEAR. AND MOREOVER IT COULD BE A LIMIT OF A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FOR PEOPLE WITH THE MOST SERIOUS CONDITIONS WHETHER IT'S CANCER. OR WELL CANCERS THE BIG WHEN I SUPPOSE BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF CONDITIONS ARE YOU CAN EVEN HAVE A MAJOR ACCIDENT- AND HAVE THESE HIGH MEDICAL BILLS LONG TERM NEED FOR ONGOING CARE. AND SO AS I WAS SAYING I THINK AT EVERY TURN IN THE PRE ACA MARKET INDIVIDUALS COULD EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THEM WHAT SERVICES THEY NEED OR WHERE THEY'VE BEEN AND SO I THINK IT IT'S DEFINITELY A MAJOR ISSUE. AND AS I SAID IT'S NOT JUST AN ISSUE FOR PEOPLE BUYING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE IT IS LAYS ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE. AND SO A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY THINGS LIKE THE PROHIBITION ON PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND THE ANNUAL AND LIFETIME LIMITS- THEN MIGHT HAVE BEFORE- I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. YES THANK YOU THAT IS HELPFUL IN MAY BE ON THE LEGAL FRONT FROM MISS RAINER WOULD HAVE A COMMENT ON THE SEVERABILITY ISSUE. THE SUPREME COURT COULD. THE HELP WALK US THROUGH THIS THAT COULD INVALIDATE SOME. MANDATE WHICH THEY ALREADY DID THE PENALTY MANDATE BUT RULED THAT THE REST OF IT. IT MAINTAINS AND IN THESE FOR. PROTECTIONS THAT ARE STILL PART OF EXISTING LAW. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT SENATOR TO YOUR QUESTION AND VERY INSIGHTFUL POINT- THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THE SUPREME COURT COULD DO HERE- AND YOU KNOW I. DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON THAT I DO THINK THEY ARE OF CAN INSTEAD THROUGH ONE LIKE YOU SAID THEY THEY COULD DECIDE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL LEAVE IT AT THAT- THEY COULD ALSO DECIDE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THEN NOT SEVERABLE FROM THE REST OF THE LAW AND TAKE DOWN THE REST OF THE LOT- ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE RELYING ON IN THE SEVERABILITY ARGUMENT BASED ON THE NFIB DECISION- ARE SOME LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. AND THOSE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS- WE'RE DYING TO SHOW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND SOME OF THE OTHER PROVISIONS INCLUDING GUARANTEED ISSUE IN SOME OF THE PRE EXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS AND SO I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME WHO THINK IF DECIDE TO MANDATE AND- THEY MAKE. TO SEVER OFF THOSE pBECAUSE THEY'RE TIED TOGETHER AND USE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS- THAT BEING SAID THERE WOULD STILL BE A GREAT AMOUNT OF HARM AND IMPACTED TEAM STATES AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR A DECISION LIKE THAT AND SO IN NO WAY IS IT A MORE MODERATE pYOU KNOW MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THAT AND WOULD BE- HARMS AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT- TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS SURVIVED AT THE SUPREME COURT. AND YOU KNOW WE THINK WE HAVE A STRONG CASE ANYTHING WERE BACKED BY A BUNCH OF BIPARTISAN- COALITION STATES GROUPS AND SO WE'RE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT. THE COURT WILL SEE IT THAT WAY TOO. THANK YOU MUCH YOU MISTER CHAIR PRESHEAF THE UPPER. THANK YOU SIR MINING AND I'D A MOVE ON TO THAT BEFORE I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE YOUR LONG SERVICE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND YOUR LEADERSHIP AND HEALTH CARE- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'LL BE AT ANY ADDITIONAL HEARINGS BEFORE- YOU YOUR TERM ACTUALLY FORMALLY ENDS BUT- I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND JUST ONLY BE MISSED OUT HERE STATE SENATE. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR SPENT ON HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE THANK YOU THANK YOU- NEXT UP I DO HAVE CENTER LEYVA FOLLOWED BY SENATOR RUBIO SIR LEYVA. TWENTY THIRD LEYVA. OKAY I THINK I'M GOOD CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU EXCELLENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MY QUESTION IS FOR MELANIE I THINK YOU LAID OUT A GREAT CASE AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT MOST OF THEIR ADULT LIFE FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE AND WOOD BEFORE I WAS IN MY ROLE AS SENATOR- BECAME A NAVIGATOR FOR THE- ACA OR THE COVER CALIFORNIA AND WAS ABLE TO SIGN UP FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO DID NOT PREVIOUSLY HAVE HEALTH CARE TO THE ACA WAS ENACTED. IF I IF I WROTE THIS DOWN BECAUSE THE THREE THINGS THAT YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE REALLY MAKE OUR CASES THAT THE PLAINTIFFS- DO NOT HAVE ANY STANDING IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN HARMED- WHAT IS LEFT OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS CONSTITUTIONAL AND CONGRESS CAN DIAL IT UP OR DOWN IF THIS PROVISION IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE REST OF THE LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL WELL THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME- AND WITHOUT MAKING THE OTHER SIDE'S CASE WHAT WOULD THEY ARGUE- THAT WOULD INVALIDATE THE- AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. YES SIR SIR AND THANK YOU SON OF THE LATE GAS. FOR YOUR SERVICE AND- BEING NAVIGATOR THAT'S REALLY WONDERFUL AND- YEAH I THINK THE OTHER SIDE IS COMPLETELY RELYING ON A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE- THAT THEY'VE YOU KNOW CONSISTENTLY HAVE. PUT OUT IN THEIR PAPERS AND FILIGS- BASED OFF OF THE NFIB DECISION- THAT THAT MANDY WAS NO LONGER CONSTITUTIONAL AND SO EVERYTHING ELSE NOT SEPARABLE AND WHAT THEY'RE USING AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT ARE THESE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. FROM THE ACA ITSELF THERE'S ACTUALLY- A COUPLE OF FINDINGS IN THE LAW AS IT WAS PASSED THAT WERE DONE FOR COMMERCE CLAUSE AND OTHER SORT OF CONSIDERATIONS. AND THOSE FINDINGS TIED TO GATHER EVERYTHING AND SO THAT THAT IS THE BASIS OF THEIR ARGUMENT THAT- YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK TO WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL OR SUSAN COLLINS SAID ON THE UNITED STATES SENATE FLOOR TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. DAIS TWENTY SEVENTEEN CONGRESS MEN YOU SHOULD LOOK TO THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TEN A CONGRESS THAT HAD NO INSIGHT INTO OR PURVIEW INTO WHAT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CONGRESS WAS. DOING AND YOU KNOW SEPARABILITY DOCTRINE AS A AS A FLUID DOCTOR OF LAW BUT I THINK YOU KNOW GIVEN THE BODY OF STATEMENTS AND ALSO THE CASE FIVE. I THINK WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT. THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE THAT A CONGRESS SEVEN YEARS AGO SHOULDN'T BE IN THE CITING FACTOR FOR WHETHER OR NOT THE- BACKBONE OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM EXIST. THEY YOU VERY MUCH AND PLEASE KEEP UP THE FIGHT WE APPRECIATE YOU. THANK YOU SIR LABOR CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I ALSO WANT TO THINK OTHER PRESENTERS SITES A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION BUT UP FOR ME PERSONALLY WHEN I HEAR THINGS OUT LIKE THE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS SUCH AS PREGNANCY AND NOW WE KNOW THE PUBLIC NINETEEN HAS COST A LOT MORE YOU KNOW CAN CONCERNED I JUST WANT TO ASK AND ANSWER TO PUT IN A SITUATION WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER BUT- WE DO KNOW THAT AFTER NINE ELEVEN. IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS TO SEE THAT THE AFTER EFFECTS OF WHAT THE FIRST RESPONDERS HAD DEALT WITH ANYTHING AS THE TRAGEDY WAS UNFOLDING AND A LOT OF THEM PERISHED YEARS LATER- ARE WE IS THERE DATA ON CLUB IN NINETEEN IN THE AFTER EFFECTS CURRENTLY THAT WE HAVE AND IS IT USING BEING USED AS PART OF THE ARGUMENT. IN PARTICULAR I KNOW PER A PERSONAL FRIEND WHO'S DEALING WITH READING ISSUES AND LONG ISSUES I MEAN IS THERE DATA THAT WE ARE USING ACTUAL RESEARCH. TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT EVIDENCE. DESPITE SIR SENATOR CAN UPON SORRY I HAPPY TO START A TALK TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT SUIT AND CENTER IN OUR IN OUR BIGGEST FREAKS WHICH WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND WE HAD MANY MANY GROUPS PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS- ECONOMISTS TALK ABOUT SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT THAT SORT OF WE DON'T KNOW THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS OF THIS- AND TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THAT AND HEALTH IMPACTS SO WE'RE HAPPY TO SEND THOSE OVER THE ONLY THING I WOULD FLAG IS MY MOM HAD CODED THIS SUMMER SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL SHE WAS ON A BREATHING MACHINE. SHE WAS VERY VERY SICK- AND LIKE YOU'RE SAYING YOUR FRIEND IT'S NOT JUST CODED SHE HAS JOINT PAIN NOW SHE HAS BEEN MUSEUM ISSUES SHE GETS VERY TIRED SHE HAS FOGGY BRAIN AND SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE TRUE IMPACT OF THAT WOULD SO YOU KNOW PUTTING THE PRE EXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS ON THE LINE AT THIS POINT IT IS SORT OF NONSENSICAL AND I THINK SOMETHING THAT WILL HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN CERTAINLY. AS WE DON'T AS WE KNOW MORE MORE MORE WE JUST DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW. YEAH OKAY. SENATOR THIS IS- DEBRA. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE DO KNOW A FEW THINGS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SET THAT CONTEXT WE KNOW THAT THE DECISION BEFORE THE ACA THE DECISION ON WHAT WOULD BE A PRE EXISTING CONDITION HOW FAR BACK IT WOULD GO WHAT WOULD COUNT WITH THE RATIONALE ALL OF THOSE DECISIONS WERE MADE BY THE HEALTH PLANS WITH ZERO GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT. AND THERE WAS NO LIMIT ON WHAT THEY COULD SAY AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF EXAMPLES ONE EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MY MIND IS THAT YOU COULD BE DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE YOU WERE A BAD WEATHER BEYOND NORMAL POTTY TRAINING YEARS AND YOU COULD BE NOW S. FORTY YEAR OLD PERSON AND YOU COULD BE DENIED COVERAGE BASED ON THAT. BASED ON ALLERGIES BASED ON LOTS OF THINGS THAT WERE NOT EITHER EVEN PRESENT IN YOUR CURRENT HEALTH STATUS OR THAT WERE NOT WHAT WE THINK OF AS REALLY SERIOUS CONDITIONS SO AND IT'S CERTAINLY LIKELY MORE THAN LIKELY REALLY THAT THE HEALTH PLANS WOULD JUST SAY BECAUSE IT WAS A PRE EXISTING CONDITION AND THEY DON'T REALLY NEED TO MAKE A CASE TO ANYONE- THAT THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE FOR THAT AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHY IT'S SUCH A- FRIGHTENING PROSPECT BECAUSE WE GO BACK TO A TIME. AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN AGREE WITH EACH OTHER YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH PLAN THEY WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT CRITERIA. AND STANDARDS FOR THAT. THANK YOU SIR RUBIO- I DID ALSO HAVE A QUESTION PARTICULARLY FOR. DIFFICULT SIR FALLING APART CENTER RUBIO SAID CAN CAN YOU- PER DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE FOR THE NUMBER OF PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS PRIOR TO THE ACA WHO HAD A PRE EXISTING CONDITION SO WE TALK ABOUT PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE EITHER DENIED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OR- HAVE TO PAY MUCH HIGHER RATES FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF PRE EXISTING CONDITION HOW MANY. PEOPLE OR WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE HAD A PRE EXISTING CONDITION I WANTED HIM TO INSURANCE. PRIOR TO THE EIGHT MONTHS YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION CENTER I. A QUESTION I SHOULD HAVE DEFINITELY LOOKED UP BEFORE THE HEARING BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT- IN THE TIME PERIOD. BEFORE THE ACA WE CAN EXPECT THAT 2230% OF PEOPLE WITH BUDGET BE DENIED HEALTH INSURANCE. AT A MINIMUM THOSE WHERE THE LOW ESTIMATES. AND REMEMBER THERE WAS LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD THE WORLD AND DIDN'T EVEN APPLY- WHEN THEY HAD HEALTH CONDITIONS AND WE HAD A VERY. INSUFFICIENT PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN AND DENY COVERAGE THEY THEY HAD TO DENY ALL FROM TWO DIFFERENT COMPANIES THEY COULD BE IN OUR HIGH RISK POOL AT THE TIME AND- IT WAS A QUITE. A QUITE A DIVERSE ARRAY OF REASONS BUT SO I THINK. PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE IS THE NUMBER 2230% OF AMERICANS HAVE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT. AND I THINK THOSE ESTIMATES ARE ALWAYS LOW BECAUSE I DO THINK PEOPLE GO TO THESE BROADER HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT MIGHT BE A PREVIOUS LIKE HEART DISEASE LIKE CANCER LIKE AIDS HIV. THOSE KINDS OF OBVIOUS LAW- EXPENSIVE CONDITIONS BUT I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW BROAD THE CRITERIA THE HEALTH PLANS FOR USING AT THE TIME. AND THAT JUST WOULD ADD EVEN TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE. THANK YOU AFTER THAT- WHAT THE MIRACLE OF- THE INTERNET I WAS ABLE TO LOOK UP A QUICKLY. YEAH DEPARTMENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID SERVICES SAID I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO SEE SOME VARIABILITY IN TERMS OF HOW THE MEASURE THAT- NINETEEN TO FIFTY PERCENT. ONE IN TWO AMERICANS. AT AT EIGHT PREVIOUS IN CONDITION WHEN IT CAME TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. SO I THINK WE NED TO THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OVERTURNING THE ACA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD AFFECT HALF OF ALL AMERICANS- IN TERMS OF DURABILITY GET HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE&lt;/c&gt; RATES AND FAIR RATES SO. I APPRECIATE THAT. SO I WOULD DO IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY SEE NO HANDS UP. SO I JUST WANT THAT AGAIN THANK BOTH DEBRA COACH AND MELANIE. RAYNER FUND IS RAINER SO MUCH FOR YOUR EXCELLENT PRESENTATIONS AND THAT TELLING US GIVING US THIS OVERVIEW AND ALSO THE LEGAL STATUS AND SOME OF THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS- CERTAINLY I THINK WERE- HERE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS. THE SUPREME COURT UNFORTUNATELY. RULES IN A WAY- AT AND THIS IS A- COURT CASE THAT IS BEEN BROUGHT FORTH. BY A- FORTUNATELY- SOME REPUBLICAN- ATTORNEY GENERAL THEY BELIEVED AND SUPPORTED STRONGLY BY SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS DEPARTMENT JUSTICE TO STRIP AWAY COVERAGE FROM- POTENTIALLY HALF OF ALL AMERICANS- SO. LET'S NOW FOCUS MORE ON CALIFORNIA IMPACTS SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PEACE PANEL AND- FOR THIS PANEL WE HAVE. PETER LEAVES I GIVE DIRECTOR OF COVERED CALIFORNIA WILL LATE BORN- IS DIRECTOR OF THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WITH JC COOPER'S ARE STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR.

DR PAM THEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON PETERLEE AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COVERED CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE BASED MARKETPLACE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY IS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE AND- THEN I'M GOING TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY. SO MORE THAN TEN YEARS AFTER ITS PASSAGE MANY OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE POLICY AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ARE NOW GENERATING PROGRESS. YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ALREADY ABOUT THE POLICIES PROTECTING CONSUMERS WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. BUT ANOTHER POLICIES THAT REQUIRE INSURERS TO MEET MINIMUM COVERAGE STANDARDS AND PLAY BY A NEW SET OF RULES DESIGNED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. FREE PREVENTIVE SERVICES ARE NOW THE LAW WITH THE OF EMPLOYER COVERAGE WE'RE IN A MARKET PLACE OR MEDICAL. NO ANNUAL LIFETIME CAP ON MEDICAL EXPENSES. MAKING COVERAGE AFFORDABLE FOR MILLIONS BY EXPANDING MEDICAID AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL HELP THROUGH MARKETPLACES LIKE COVERED CALIFORNIA. THESE KEY PILLARS OF THE LAW HAD BECOME ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED BY AMERICANS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. THEY INSURE MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO MEANINGFUL COVERAGE THEY GIVE THEM CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HEALTH AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS. OF THE NATION ESPECIALLY THE TIME ABOUT ECONOMIC AND HEALTH CARE CRISIS WE SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING TO. BUT UNDER CUT OR INVALIDATE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO BUILD ON IT. SO CALIFORNIA HAS EMBRACED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND COVERED CALIFORNIA HAS USED ALL THE TOOLS OF THE LAW AS WELL AS ADDITIONS ENACTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S TO BUILD A STRONG AND SUSTAINABLE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. THAT NOT ONLY PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO MANY CALIFORNIANS BUT WE'VE ALSO HELP KEEP HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS DOWN. BENEFITING THOSE WHO DO NOT GET SUBSIDIES. TAKEN TOGETHER CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR CONSUMERS. YOU'LL HEAR A MOMENT FROM WILL I BORN AND J. C. COOPER ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BENEFITTED FROM EXPANDED MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY. THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN PREMIUM INCREASES OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS BETTER THAN HALF OF THOSE OF FEDERALLY FACILITATED MARKETPLACE STATES. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. LEVERAGING AND BUILDING ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER AND WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE RESPONDED. ACTIVELY TO THE DIRECT BENEFIT OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS INSURED TODAY BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE AND MORE PEOPLE THAN WE EVER INJURED BEFORE. WE'RE NOW HEADING INTO OPEN ENROLLMENT. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH A ALL TIME HIGH OF OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION RENEWING ENROLLEES. AT ALL TIME LOW OF A ZERO POINT 5% PREMIUM INCREASE FOR NEXT YEAR. REVERSING THE GAINS WE HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC. FOR MILLIONS A RELIABLE LAW FOR THE FINANCIAL HELP IN CRITICAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT EMIT HEALTH COVERAGE ACCESSIBLE FOR SO MANY. ABOUT A CRITICAL POINT IS AT THE CORE PROVISIONS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR WALDRON TIGHTLY TOGETHER. MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE SOME SECTIONS WITHOUT CAUSING GRAVE HARM TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. IT ACTUALLY HEARD RECENTLY A LOT OF FEDERAL PROPOSALS TO POTENTIALLY PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. BUT NOT ADDRESS OTHER PROVISIONAL LAW. NOT SAYING YOU HAVE A POLICY THAT CAN PRESERVE PREEXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS OF THE ACA WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE OTHER ELEMENTS IS LIKE SAYING WE WILL KEEP A PLANE IN THE AIR BY PROTECTING ITS WINGS. BUT NOT MAKING SURE THE PLAN AS AN ENGINE A RUNNER OR LANDING GEAR. ONE AIRPLANE-NEEDS WINGS TO FLY IT ALSO NEEDS OTHER CORE ELEMENTS TO GET PASSENGERS SAFELY TO WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET. TO SAY YOU CAN SEPARATE OUT PRE EXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS FROM THE OTHER CORE ELEMENTS OF THE ACA SUCH AS SUBSIDIES AND THE CHANGES TO OTHER INSURANCE ROLES IS BOTH ECONOMIC AND HEALTH CARE FALLACY. ADDITIONALLY THE COMMITTEE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIANS IN THE FORM OF THE FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES TO MAKE COVERAGE. MORE AFFORDABLE THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA. NINE OUT OF TEN OF OUR ENROLLEES GET THOSE SUBSIDIES. THIS FEDERALLY FUNDED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT. OF MAKING COVERAGE REAL FOR CONSUMERS. THE PROMISE OF THE ACTIONS THAT OUR STATE HAS TAKEN TO EMBRACE THE BILL ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WILL NOT BE REALIZED IF CONSUMERS ARE PRICED OUT OF COVERAGE. WHEN IT COMES THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COVER CALIFORNIA'S STRONG WERE STABLE WE'RE WELL POSITIONED. TO CONTINUE OUR ROLE OF THE ROLLING CALIFORNIANS IN AFFORDABLE AND QUALITY COVERAGE. OPEN ENROLLMENT RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER WERE POISED TO LAUNCH A BIG STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN. THE WILL HELP CUT THROUGH THE NOISE AND REASSURE CONSUMERS THAT WERE HERE NATURAL. BUT WHAT WE RIGHTLY DISCUSSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME THE CALIFORNIA VERSUS TEXAS AND I WANT TO DO A HUGE CALL OUT OF APPRECIATION TO ATTORNEY GENERAL BECERRA. WHO'S LED THE NATION IN DEFENDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE NEED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT WE MAY BE AT A POINT WHERE BUILDING ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FEDERALLY COULD ONCE AGAIN BE FRONT AND CENTER. AS STRONG AS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS WE NEED-TO CONTINUE TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN THE LAW. AND ADDRESS REAL AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT ARE THERE TODAY WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE NEED TO BETTER ADDRESS RACIAL AND ECONOMIC RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE FRAGILITY AND OFTEN ADEQUACY OF CURRENT EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. THAT SHOULD BE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AGAIN THANK YOU DR PANDA MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. DURING TODAY'S HEARINGS PUBLIC BORDER RESPONDED ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AFTER THE TESTIMONY FROM THE OTHER ABLE WITNESSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH PETERLEE- LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO- WILL LIGHT BORN DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN G. C. COOPER OR STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES A SENIOR TAG TEAMING IT. GOOD ACTUALLY. WE HAVE TRANSITIONED OVER- UNFORTUNATELY I DR- DIRECTOR LIKE PORN IS NOT ABLE TO SB TODAY HE APOLOGIZES FOR HIS ABSENCE AND SO I WILL. PROVIDE THE TESTIMONY THIS MORNING AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF. A MEDIC CAL AND SO I AM DC COOPER THE CALIFORNIA STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR. I HATE TO SAY THE ACA LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COVERAGE EXPANSION IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT- IT HAS EXPANDED. OUR COVERAGE ACROSS MEDIC CAL IN THE BROADER HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN ECONOMY AND CALIFORNIA. IT HAS BEEN A CATALYST FOR PAYMENT AND DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORMS THAT NOT ONLY TRANSFORMED WHO HAS COVERAGE. BUT HOW IT'S PAID FOR. MANY SPEAKERS BEFORE ME HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE PROFOUND IMPACT THE ACS HAD ON CALIFORNIANS AS A WHOLE. I WILL FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE IMPACT A TWO MINUTE CAL. ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR CARE THROUGH MEDICAID. MAKING DH CS THE ARGEST HEALTHCARE PURCHASER IN CALIFORNIA. MEDICAID EXPANSION HAS HELPED ON MANY LOW INCOME WORKERS AN ESSENTIAL WORK PLACES ARE INDUSTRIES WERE OFTEN NOT AFTER JOB COVERAGE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN INVALUABLE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND OUR RESPONSE TO COPE IN IN CALIFORNIA. ESEA HAS PROVIDED MORE FINANCIAL SECURITY AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE MEDICAID EXPANSION HAS MADE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO AFFORD. NEEDED HEALTHCARE WHICH REDUCES MEDICAL DEBT. PROBLEMS WITH PAYING BILLS AND ADDICTIONS ABOUT THE VICTIMS FELL 20% IN EXPANSION STATES COMPARED TO NON EXPANSION STATES AFTER EXPANSION TOOK EFFECT. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF NON HEALTH IMPACT. OF THE ECA AND HOW IT HAS HELPED IN BENEFITTED MANY CALIFORNIANS IN PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION. TO SAY THAT THE ACA IS HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON MEDIC HOW. IS PROFOUND IMPACT IT IMPACTS ELIGIBILITY FUNDING. BENEFITS A VARIETY OF THE I'VE BEEN A YOUR PROTECTION. SOON I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT A VARIETY OF DIRECT IMPACT ON CAL I WILL INCLUDE KIND OF. AN ELEGY NUMBER TO PROVIDE CLIENTS TO THE IMPACT OF SOMETHING LIKE THE ACA. BEING ELIMINATED OR REPEALED. AS MANY YEAR WHERE THE ACA ESTABLISHED NEW OPTIONAL. GROUP THAT HAS CURRENTLY ASK FUNDED WITH 90% OF FEDERAL FUNDING. THIS REPRESENTS AN EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION FEDERAL FUNDS IN OUR CURRENT CALIFORNIA BUDGET. IT ALSO INCLUDES COVERAGE FOR OVER THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE ACA ALSO SIMPLIFIED ELIGIBILITY RULES WHICH ELIMINATED CONSIDERATION ASSETS AND RESOURCES. FOR MOST NON ELDERLY POPULATIONS I WHICH INCREASED ENROLLMENT AMONG EXISTING MEDICAL POPULATIONS SUCH AS CHILDREN FROM FOUR POINT NINE MILLION IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO FIVE POINT TWO MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY. FURTHERMORE IT ALLOWED YOUNG ADULTS TO REMAIN ON THEIR PARENTS HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS UNTIL TWENTY SIX WHICH ALLOWED FORMER FOSTER YOUTH TO RETAIN MEDI CAL COVERAGE AND TELL TWENTY SIX. WE CURRENTLY COVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH UNDER THESE PROVISIONS. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR HOSPITAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY WHICH STREAMLINES ENROLLMENT FOR THOSE WITH IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND HELP REDUCES UNCOMPENSATED HEALTH CARE COSTS. WE CURRENTLY COVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS UNDER HOSPITAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY EVERY MONTH AND MEDICAL. THE IMPACT THE AC IS HAD ON OUR SAFETY NET IS SIZABLE. THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE HOW REDUCE COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTY NEEDS AND SAFETY NET FOR DOCTOR WRITERS I REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND SHIFTING COSTS FROM THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE POPULATION TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU TO THE ACA UNCOMPENSATED CARE COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS DECLINE FROM APPROXIMATELY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION. IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. A TWO BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY. ALSO HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS BROUGHT FORTH BY THE ACA IN MEDICAL. IN ADDITION TO ENHANCING FUNDING FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES WHICH ARE CLEARLY NEEDED FOR OUR CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THAT ACCOUNT. BUT TO COMPLY WITH THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS STANDARD IN THE ACA MEDICAL ALSO ADDED NEW BENEFITS FOR ALL POPULATIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MILD TO MODERATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AS WELL AS THINGS LIKE CARDIAC AND PULMONARY REHABILITATION. WITH AN OPTIONAL EXPANSION COVERAGE MANY ADULTS ARE ALSO RECEIVING INCREASED ACCESS TO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. IF THE ACA'S REPEALED THIS COULD MEAN INCREASED DEMAND FOR SERVICES PROVIDED FOR NON MEDICAL PROGRAMS AND COUNTIES MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. FULLY ABSORB THE INCREASED DEMANDS. ECA ALSO PROVIDED STATES WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR I JUST ASKED NEARLY FIRST CHOICE OR WHAT'S KNOWN AS CISCO. CIPRO RECIPIENTS MAKE UP POPULATION WHICH COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON MEDIC HOUSE MOST VULNERABLE. WE ALSO CONVERTED OUR PRIOR FAMILY HEALTH PLANNING DEMONSTRATION- WHICH ALLOWS SPORTS FANS THE ELIGIBILITY TO THE STATE PLAN THIS IS KNOWN AS F. PACKED PROGRAM THE ACA GIVE HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT ARE REBATES. FOR COVERED DRUGS AND MADE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM- INTEGRITY. WE ALSO IT ALSO CONTAINED A NUMBER OF DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS- THAT ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO ROLL OUT THINGS LIKE OUR HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM OR THE COUNTY CONNECT DEMONSTRATION. AS YOU CAN SEE THE ACA HAS ENABLED CALIFORNIA TO LEVERAGE MEDIC HOW AS A TOOL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS- WELL TAKING A POPULATION HEALTH. PERSON CENTERED APPROACH PROVIDING SERVICES AND IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AS DEBRA MENTIONED EARLIER- IS ALSO HELPED REDUCED HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES. WHICH IS SO CRITICAL AT THE TIME AS A TIME RIGHT NOW. TRACKING DOWN THE ACA WOULD BE DISASTROUS FOR A STATE BY CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE NATION. IN UNDOING THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS IT WOULD HARM COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDERS WHO ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF COPING. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE COMMITTEE ON. THANK YOU DAISY COOPER- WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL- LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO BEN JOHNSON AS THE PRINCIPAL FISCAL POLICY ANALYST FOR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HI YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THAT CALIFORNIA FISCAL IMPACT IF THE ACA WERE AND OVERTURNED IN ITS ENTIRETY- AND WE FIRST JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATUS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED OF THE ACA. IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT COULD GO IN ITS RULING INCLUDING OVERTURNING THE LAW COMPLETELY UPHOLDING THE LAW ON ITS ENTIRETY. OR OVERTURNING SELECT PROVISIONS AND THE OLD AND ULTIMATELY THE FISCAL IMPACTS IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION WILL DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WHICH OF THESE DIRECTIONS THE SUPREME COURT CHOOSES TO GO. WE DO HAVE A HAND OUT- THAT WAS SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT WILL FORM THE BASIS FAR REMARKS AND THE PUBLIC CAN ACCESS THIS HANDOUT BE OUR WEBSITE. THE PREVIOUS TESTIFIES PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE ACA DID AND IT'S UNCERTAIN LEGAL STATUS SO OFTEN GETS ON THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE ACA BEING OVERTURNED. STARTING ON PAGE TWO OF OUR HAND OUT WE ESTIMATE THAT THE ACA DIRECTLY PROVIDES TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE STATE RESIDENTS. I KNOW THAT THIS THIS THERE IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN PREVIOUS ESTIMATES BUT THAT'S REALLY ONLY DUE TO A FISCAL YEAR DIFFERENCE. AS WE HAVE PROVIDED ESTIMATES FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WELL SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING IS ESTIMATED- IN PART DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OVERTURNING THE ENTIRE ACA WITHOUT REPLACEMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF THIS TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE STATE. WHICH WOULD HAVE MAJOR NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FIRST IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT THE STATE'S NEW ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY WITH PARTICULAR IMPACT ON PROVIDERS THAT FORM THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET. AND SECOND IT WOULD PLACE AT RISK HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHOSE HEALTH COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANTLY AS A CONSEQUENCE. NEXT UP TURN TO SOME OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF OVERTURNING THE ACA. AS YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND OUT UNDER THE ACA MEDICOS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY BOTH IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT AND FUNDING. FROM TWENTY TWELVE THIRTEEN A YEAR BEFORE THE ACA GENERALLY TOOK AFFECT TO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ENROLLMENT IN MEDI CAL BROUGH FROM NINETEEN OR SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE TO THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD TOTAL ANNUAL FUNDING FOR MEDICAL DOUBLED FROM FIFTY MILLION FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WITH FEDERAL FUNDS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 75% OF THIS GROWTH IN TOTAL FUNDING. AND WHILE SUCH GROWTH CANNOT EXCLUSIVELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACA IS WITHOUT QUESTION THAT THE ACA PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THIS GROWTH OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. PRESS THE LARGEST CHANGE THE ACA BROUGHT FOR MEDIC CAL IS WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME KNOWN AS THE ACA OPTIONAL EXPANSION WHICH EXPANDED MEDICAID COVERAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO CHILDLESS ADULTS. IN CONTRAST TO TRADITIONALLY ELIGIBLE ENROLLEES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS 90% OF THE COST OF COVERAGE FOR THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION. CALIFORNIA ADOPTED THIS EXPANSION AT ITS FIRST OPPORTUNITY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TODAY AT THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION MEDICAL MEMBERS ARE COVERED THROUGH THE EXPANSION. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE STATE RECEIVED AT LEAST SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THE EXPANSION IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. THIS EXPANSION AS WELL AS OTHER CHANGES TO MEDICARE RULES FACILITATED BY THE ACA HAS IMPROVED ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR A NUMBER OF OLDER A POPULAR. POPULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE CHANGES TO ELIGIBILITY RULES HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO A REDUCTION IN THE STATE'S UNINSURED POPULATION. TODAY AN INCREASING SHARE OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS HAVE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE ALL FOLLOWING THEIR RELEASE FROM INSTITUTION IMPROVING THEIR ACCESS TO CARE AND FINALLY AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED- SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WE ESTIMATE AROUND 45% MORE ADULTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. ARE RECEIVING TREATMENT THROUGH MEDICARE L. A. COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ONE ADDITIONAL ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WISH BY THE ACA THAT I WOULD BRIEFLY MENTION IS THAT FOR PERSONAL CARE SERVICES. THROUGH THE STATE'S IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM THE STATE AVAILS ITSELF O THIS FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITY WHICH PROVIDES AROUND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING ANNUALLY RESULTING IN EQUIVALENT STAY SAVINGS. SO TO SUMMARIZE THE FISCAL IMPACT IF THE ACA WERE OVERTURNED ENTIRELY STATE COULD LOSE MORE THAN SEVENTEENPOINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MEDICAID I'LL AND MILLIONS OF CURRENT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES COULD LOSE THEIR COVERAGE. NEXT I'LL TURN TO THE ACA AND COVER CALIFORNIA WHICH STARTS ON PAGE SEVEN OF OUR HAND OUT. AS NOTED BY OUR FEATHER TESTIFIES CALIFORNIA CREATED ITS OWN HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE CARL CALLED COVERED CALIFORNIA WHERE RELATIVELY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THAT HELP PAY FOR THE COST OF COVERAGE. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION RIGHT MILLION STATE RESIDENTS RECEIVE SUCH SUBSIDIES TOTALING MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. OVERTURNING THE ACA WOULD RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF THESE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES AND THIS WOULD BE HIGHLY DISRUPTIVE FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA AND COVERED CALIFORNIA THE RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVE COVERAGE THROUGH THE EXCHANGE. POLICY HOLDERS WOULD LIKELY BEAR MUCH MORE OF THE COST OF THEIR PREMIUMS IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES AND FACING SUCH COST INCREASES MANY POLICY HOLDERSWOULD LIKELY CHOOSE TO DROP THEIR COVERAGE. MAYBE BECOMING UNINSURED. LESLIE I'LL BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE ACA'S ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUND WHICH STARTS ON PAGE NINE OF OUR HAND OUT. THIS ONGOING FEDERAL FUNDING STREAM IS USED TO EXPAND AND SUSTAIN PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND REFLECTS ONE OF THE MORE FLEXIBLE. HEALTH FUNDING STREAMS IN TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AGENCIES RECEIVED ABOUT FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF THE ANNUAL. WHICH HAS BEEN USED TO SUPPORT IMMUNIZATIONS EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND LABORATORY CAPACITY CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND TO BUY TOBACCO USE PREVENTION AND CESSATION OVERTURNING THE ACA ENTIRELY WOULD RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF THIS FUND. AND COULD REDUCE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES JUST MENTIONED. THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH BEN JOHNSON ALL RIGHT- NOW AGAIN TURN IT TO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. MEMBERS CENTER MONEY. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO ALSO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS PANEL. IN TO FOLLOW UP ON MY QUESTION TO THE LAST PANEL. SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE CITED THE IMPORTANCE OF. TEXTING THE PROHIBITION ON PUTTING A LIMIT ON ANNUAL OR LIFETIME. COVERAGE BY INSURANCE COMPANIES. COULD ANY OF YOU EXPAND UPON ANY EXAMPLES OF THE EITHER LACK OF ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE FOR THE ECONOMIC- CATASTROPHE THAT CAN BEFALL AN INDIVIDUAL OR A FAMILY WHO EXCEEDS THE LIMIT OF THEIR COVERAGE HAS EXISTED BEFORE. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT- AGAIN I'M JUST LOOKING FOR ANY FURTHER INFORMATION ANY OF YOU MIGHT PROVIDE FOR THOSE WATCHING OR LISTENING WHO MAY HAVE SOME SENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING BANS ON PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS BUT AGAIN THE LIFETIME CAPS THE ANNUAL CAP ON COVERAGE WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES. OF HOW THAT IMPACTS THE PATIENT COMMUNITY CALIFORNIANS. IF WE LOSE THAT PROTECTION. BUT CENTER MONITOR WE HAVE AS A CRACK ABOUT IT THAT'S OKAY FOR THE OTHER PANELS. AND PERSONA NOTES CENTER MONEY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THE U. MANY YEARS REALLY BEEN A CHAMPION HEALTHCARE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT IS. THE COUPLE I THINK ABOUT THE PROTECTION THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THE- ONE IS AT THE EXTREMES BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THERE WAS IN MANY HEALTH POLICIES FOR EMPLOYER AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. CAPS ON LIFETIME BENEFITS OR ANNUAL CAPS. NOW IT DOESN'T AFFECT A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT IF YOU'RE A- PARENT WHO HAS A PREEMIE. A CHILD WHO NEEDS TO BE IN INTENSIVE CARE IT CAN LITERALLY BE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- IF YOU HAVE. CANCER YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS YOU CAN BLOW THROUGH THE CAP AND IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. BUT THE OTHER PART THAT'S ONE OF FLAG IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. THOSE WHICH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BUT- YEAH WE HEARD A MOMENT AGO FROM. DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL RANIERE ABOUT HER MOTHER- NEED HIM IN THE HOSPITAL FOR CALLED IT AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT SEEMED LIKE SHE GOT WELL AND GOT OUT OF THERE. D. A. C. A. WORLD. WHEN SHE GOT OUT OF THERE. FOR ABOUT. 20% OF CALIFORNIANS. SHE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THERE. WITH A SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL. AND THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA'S LOWER INCOME. DOESN'T HAVE A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK LET ALONE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK. AND WHY NOT A PROBLEM. IT'S A PROBLEM TWO FOUR. ONE THAT PERSON IS WALKING AROUND. WITH THE POTENTIAL LITERALLY LOSING THEIR HOMES THEIR LIVELIHOOD BECAUSE OF THE DEBT TO A HOSPITAL THAT UNCOMPENSATED DEBT. BUT MORE THAN THAT. IT MEANS PEOPLE ARE SCARED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL ARE SCARED TO GET TREATMENT AREN'T GETTING CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME JUST THINKING. OH MY GOD. IF I MAY BE STUCK WITH A SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL. A LITTLE WAIT LONGER. ONE OF THE REASON WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE NATION AND ANOTHER'S. PERSON SPOKE WAS COOPER DID. AROUND HEALTHEQUITY. WE'VE SEEN ACROSS AMERICA. THE LIKELIHOOD OF DYING FROM COLD IT IS FAR HIGHER FOR LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS A BIG PART OF THAT IS THEY'RE GETTING CARE SLOWER THEY ARE GETTING TESTED AS QUICKLY THIS IS IT REALLY LIKE TO COVERAGE THAT'S REAL COVERAGE. THANK YOU MISTER LEE ANN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN BUILDING. THE COVERED CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE STRONGEST IF NOT THE STRONGEST PROGRAM OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DON'T KNOW IF OTHERS HAVE COMMENTS FROM THE PANEL BUT I DEFER BACK TO YOU RIGHT THANK YOU- CENTER RUBIO AND THEN FOR ANY OF THE REMOTE PARTICIPANTS PLEASE USE THE RAZOR HAND FEATURE IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I KNOW THEY WERE ALL VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS WILL TURN OUT WELL. AND WE WON'T HAVE T DEAL WITH THIS BUT IN THE EVENT THAT THE SUPREME COURT DOES STRIKE DOWN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT- WHAT ARE THEY DEPARTMENTS DOING IN TERMS OF GETTING AHEAD AT THIS ARE PREPARING TO. DO OUTREACH TO SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY SECOND LANGUAGE- COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OUT MASS CONFUSION AND ANXIETY AND I THINK THIS GENERALLY. YOU KNOW EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT IS THERE SOMETHING IN PLACE TO GET AHEAD OF THIS HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS. TWENTY GETS HERE. CAN ANYBODY ANSWER THEM. FOR SO I CAN START AND THEN OTHERS CAN DEFINITELY CHIME IN SO- AGAIN G. C. COOPER HERE- ON YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF ASPECTS IN REGARDS TO A CONTINGENCY PLANNING I THINK THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CMS- IN REGARDS TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM BUT THIS WOULD MEAN A LOT OF THAT IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON WHAT IS DECIDED ON THE BUT I AS WE OUTLINED IN THE IMPACTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION ADULTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY BEING COVERED BY THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION. AS WELL AS OTHERS WHO HAVE BENEFITTED FROM ON THE. SIMPLIFIED ELIGIBILITY RULES AND MET HOW THE IMPACT WOULD BE SICK TO CAL ON WITH EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION FEDERAL FUNDS CURRENTLY IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET- WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SERIOUS DECISIONS IN CALIFORNIA AROUND COVERAGE- CLEARLY IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR NOT ONLY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM BUT FOR THE STATE AS A WHOLE I'M ENSURING PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVING THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHTS- IT THAT SOMEONE SHOULD AUDIT ALL INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO- THERE WOULD BE HARD BUDGET DECISIONS IN FRONT OF US BUT A LOT OF THAT'S REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON. THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE SO IT'S HARD TO DO YOU MUCH CONTINGENCY PLANNING BECAUSE OF THERE BEING SO MANY THINGS THAT STILL NEED TO BE DECIDED I WOULD ALSO IMAGINE WITH ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE BUT WOULD BE HAPPY FOR OTHERS TO WEIGH IN THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A TRANSITION OR GOT A GLIDE PATH ON THEIR FEDERAL PROTECTIONS A BENEFICIARY PER PROTECTIONS IN REGARDS TO HOW YOU WOULD TRANSITION OUT OF COVERAGE LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HOWEVER STE A LOT OF THINGS TO BE DECIDED- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF ADVOCATES AND OTHERS. MANY OF WHICH WERE GONNA SPEAK LATER ON ON THIS COMMITTEE OUR TO THIS COMMITTEE AND WE WOULD. WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS THE LAW. IN EVER. BUT TO COME UP WITH THE- PLAN OF HOW WE WOULD ADDRESS. ANYTHING IN REGARDS YOU ARE WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE- THE DECISION- BUT TO SAVE THE IMPACT WOULD NOT BE- YOU KNOW. BROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THAT THE BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED. ON THE UNDER THE ACA AND THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED IN MEDICARE. OPEN TO ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE OTHER COLLEAGUES. YEAH ADULT OCCUPANT I DON'T KNOW TO RAISE MY HAND CAN I RESPOND AS WELL YES PLEASE. READ THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS IT ALL IN THE HOPE IS THAT TALKING ABOUT CONTINGENCY PLANS LIKE TALKING ABOUT ADDING A FEW LIKE WHICH THE TITANIC AND NOT AVOIDING AN ICEBERG- WE ARE NOT SPENDING TIME ON KONDISI PLANS IS ARE WE REALLY FRANK ABOUT THAT WE'RE SPENDING TIME GETTING PEOPLE ENROLLED IN COVERAGE. IS TODAY WERE IN OPEN ENROLLMENT WE ARE MEDIKAL WILL BE ENROLLING HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE COMING MONTHS AND THE NUMBER ONE THING CALIFORNIA NO IS THEY CAN BE CONFIDENT THEY WILL HAVE COVERAGE IS GOING TO WORK FOR THEM. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE A FUTURE WITHOUT THE ACA IS A CATASTROPHIC FUTURE AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATORS HERE IN WASHINGTON NEED TO ADDRESS THAT REALITY- I THINK PART OF THE POINT OF THIS HEARING IS TO MAKE SURE NOT ONLY CALIFORNIANS BUT A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT- UNDERSTAND HOW CATASTROPHIC IT SHOULD BE. AND THE AGAIN THE ALTERNATIVES ARE SO GRIM THAT IN A COULD SEE PLANS TO OUR MINDS REALLY ARE WHAT WE CAN OR SHOULD FOCUS OUR TIME ON ITS ON THE JOB OF TODAY WHICH IS GETTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE TODAY TO GET COVERAGE THEY NEED SO THEY GET TESTED FOR CULVERT SO THEY GET THE CARE THEY NEED AND THAT'S WHAT OUR FOCUS AND- AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO A- FUTURE WHEN WE'RE NO LONGER TALKING ABOUT. EITHER SUPREME COURT CASES REPEAL AND REPLACE BUT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING SUBSIDIES ADDRESSING WHAT CALIFORNIANS DID FOR MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS THAT IN THE ACA GOT NO HELP UNTIL THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR SOME. PUT IN PLACE NEW SUBSIDIES FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS THE SERVER THE SIGNAL FOR WHAT WASHINGTON SHOULD BE DOING SO WE'D RATHER PUT OUR EFFORTS INTO SHOWING A BRIGHTER FUTURE THAN SHOWING HOW. TO GET OUT A LIFEBOAT TO THE TITANIC. THANK YOU. AND JOHN DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT CAN WE PUT FOR SOMETHING OF THAT MAGNITUDE GIVEN HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING WE GET HER THROUGH THE ACA. YEAH I CAN BRIEFLY TOUCHED ADAM FROM A PHYSICAL PERSPECTIVE PLANNING FOR THAT EVENTUALITY WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- IS AN INCREDIBLY LARGE SUM OF MONEY ARE START STATE GENERAL FUND BUDGET THIS YEAR WAS. BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND SO IT RESET IT WOULD REPRESENT A SIZEABLE INCREASE. IN THE NECESSARY STATE RESOURCES TO EXTEND THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR COVERAGE- THAT CURRENTLY GOES TO CALIFORNIA IN THE STATE SO THAT WOULD BE. YOU KNOW NEED TO BE VERY SERIOUS AND PERHAPS DIFFICULT THAT DECISIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE IN THE STATE OF HOW TO. RESPOND TO THIS LOSS OF FUNDING AND HOW TO ENSURE A CONTINUEDPROTECTIONS AND COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU I DON'T SEE ANY CANS UP FOR REMOTE TESTIMONY SO I'M GONNA ASK A FEW QUESTIONS THAN US OF FIRST OF ALL STARTING WITH A PETER LEVY WHEN THE POINTS THAT YOU MADE IN YOUR TESTIMONY WAS IS THAT THE PREMIUMS ONLY WENT UP ABOUT POINT 5% WHICH IS LESS THAN INFLATION- CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO WHAT THE ACA DID FOR PREMIUMSVERTICALLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET BECAUSE IF I RECALL AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND THE PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP LIKE 10% 11% 9% EVERY YEAR. SO SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COVERED CALIFORNIA. HOW PREMIUM INCREASES BEEN AFFECTED. BECAUSE OF THE ACA HE'S BIG THAT. ABSOLUTELY DR BENNETT AND THANKS FOR THE QUESTION LEADING UP REMIND YOU BEFORE THE ACA PREMIUMS WERE BASED ON HEALTH PLANS EXCLUDING SICK PEOPLE. BY SAYING WE DON'T WANT YOU IF YO HAD A PREVIOUS CONDITION NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO HAVING BENEFIT DESIGNS AND NO ONE UNDERSTOOD SO THEY WERE A BARRIER FOR PEOPLE GETTING CARE SO PROVIDING AS LITTLE CARE AS POSSIBLE THOSE ARE COVERED AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BILL THE PREMIUM AND THEN HUGE AMOUNTS FOR OVERHEAD THAT OUR CONTROLLED BY SOMETHING CALLED MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS. WHICH STATE HEALTH PLANS MUST NOW SPEND. THE VAST MAJORITY PREMIUMS ON HEALTH CARE. SO WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THE ACA IN CALIFORNIA- THE REASON WE'VE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB OF KEEPING PREMIUM INCREASE OF RELATIVELY LOW IS. WE'VE GOT HEALTHY PEOPLE IN. WE MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERYONE MORE PEOPLE GETTING IN MEANS A HEALTHIER RISK MIX. AND I WANT TO LOOK AT THE LAST THREE YEARS TO MAKE IT CLEAR ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOCAL ACTION AND FEDERAL ACTION. THREE YEARS AGO TWENTY NINETEEN. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE. A FEDERAL PENALTY. BUT IN THAT YEAR PREMIUMS IN CALIFORNIA WENT UP ABOUT NINE PERCENT. BECAUSE HEALTH PLANS SAID. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO. ABANDON COVERAGE% BECAUSE THAT EXTRA KNOWLEDGE OF THE PENALTY WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP MEANT. CALIFORNIA THE AND I REALLY NEED TO PRAISE THIS LEGISLATURE THIS GOVERNOR DID TWO BIG THINGS IN INDIVIDUAL MARKETS. ADDED SUBSIDIES STATE SUBSIDIES SUPPLEMENT THE FEDERAL WHICH MEANS MORE PEOPLE TO SIGN UP BUT ALSO SAID WE'RE GONNA STATE PENALTY. WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR OR PREMIUMS WENT UP POINT 8% THIS YEAR THEY'RE GOING UP POINT FIVE. THAT MEANS OVER THE THREE YEARS SINCE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN IN OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA. THE AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE HAS BEEN LESS THAN 3% AND THE REASON IS. HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS ARE DRIVEN BY WHO'S INSURED AND UNDER THE ACA HAVING POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE INJURED TO GET CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT THAT'S A WORKING MARKET PLACE THAT'S A MODEL THAT WORKS NOT HAVING SHE PREMIUMS BECAUSE YOU'RE DENYING PEOPLE ACCESS TO CARE AND HAVING INSURANCE COMPANIES GAMING THE SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY NOT BE THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT I THINK THAT'S A REALLY THE MODEL WHAT THE AC IS WORKING PRETTY WELL IN CALIFORNIA. EVEN THOUGH SUBSIDIES ACTUALLY SHOULD BE RICHER FOR LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIA PEOPLE STILL NEED HELP BUT WE GOT A SYSTEM THAT'S WORKING WELL YOU LOOK OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA TEXAS ALMOST ONE OUT OF FIVE TEXANS WITHOUT INSURANCE ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T EXPANDED MEDICAID AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET PREMIUMS HAVE SKYROCKETED SO HIGH THERE ARE NOT UNSUBSIDIZED PEOPLE LEFT EXCEPT FOR SICK PEOPLE CALIFORNIA HAS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNSUBSIDIZED CALIFORNIANS WE CAN STILL AFFORD INSURANCE BECAUSE OUR EFFORTS BRING ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE POOL TO KEEP PRICES DOWN FOR EVERYBODY. NO THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT- BECAUSE I OFTENTIMES PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW FAST PREMIUMS ARE GROWING BUT THE FACT AND COVER CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. EACH YEAR IT'S GONE UP BY LESS THAN A PERCENT WHICH IS I BELIEVE LESS THAN INFLATION. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT I THINK WHEN- SCHWARZENEGGER'S GOVERNOR LOOKING HEALTH REFORM HERE CALIFORNIA PRE ACA THOSE ESTIMATED THAT FOR EVERY PERSON WHO ACTUALLY HAD INSURANCE- THERE WAS PART WE TRY TO SUBSIDIZE THE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER. PERSON FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE DON'T STOP GETTING SICK THEIR PROBLEMS DON'T GO AWAY. SO THEY WILL EVENTUALLY SHOW FOR CARE AND THAT CARE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. WILL THEN BE SENSUALLY PASSED ON TO EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS INSURANCE AND WHO IS ABLE TO FINANCE IT. AND SO IT CREATED A LOT OF- DYSFUNCTIONAL THIS. FINANCING WHICH I THINK YOU SEE A HELP ADDRESS. I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I DO WANT TO TEST YOU PURELY IS- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT AND PEOPLE SAY WELL LOOK THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AND- I THINK- YOU KNOW BEN JOHNSON TALKED ABOUT. CAME TO THE STATE AND WE'RE PROVIDING CITY SUBSIDIES. WHERE DOES THAT MONEY GO- THE I MEAN THERE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE RIGHT DOESN'T CREATE JOBS. FOR A COUPLE THINGS NOTED IS- PUT IN AMERICA IN CALIFORNIA WILL REMIND YOU THAT. ABOUT HALF OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE TO THEIR EMPLOYER. NOW ABOUT A THIRD THROUGH MEDICARE L. AND THE BALANCE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA THE SOURCES. IF YOU HAVE EMPLOYER COVERAGE. YOU'RE GETTING A FEDERAL TAX SUBSIDY TO GET THAT COVERAGE. IF YOU COULD NOT ACCOUNT YOU GET A FEDERAL STATE SUBSIDY TO COVER. THE INDIVIDUAL MARK WAS THE ONE MARKET WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. THE ACA SAID NO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE EVERYONE A LEG UP. THE OTHER THING THE ACA SAID IS. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SOME HEALTH PLANS LITERALLY WE'RE SPENDING HALF OF THE PREMIUM DOLLARS ON HEALTHCARE. AND THE OTHER HALF ON MARKETING ON PROFIT ON YOU KNOW COP TO EXECUTIVES. NOW OTHERS ARE DIFFERENT MIX BUT SOME OF THESE PLANS WERE PRETTY BAD PLANS. NOW THOUGHTHE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAYS. IF YOU ARE OFFERING A HEALTH CARE PLANS. TO LARGE EMPLOYERS YOU MUST SPEND AT LEAST EIGHTY FIVE CENTS ON A DOLLAR FOR HEALTHCARE. HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS ARE GOING TO HEALTHCARE WHICH MEANS PEOPLE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF SPEND IT HEALTH CARE OUR NURSES AND DOCTORS AND AIDS IN HOSPITALS OR DOCTORS AND STAFF IN A CLINICAL OFFICERS IT'S PEOPLE. AND IT'S PEOPLE DOING WHAT WE WANTED TO DO PROVIDING CLINICAL CARE IT'S NOT GOING. TO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY FRIENDS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY NOT GOING INSURANCE EXECS BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO MARKET. BUT WE DO MARKETING BY GETTING MORE PEOPLE THAN WE LOWER THE COST BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT PICK PLAN EXPRESSES PLAN WHY IT'S ABOUT GETTING COVERED THAT'S WHAT WE WANT MONEY TO BE SPENT ON IT. GETTING PEOPLE IN THE DOOR AND THEN MAKING SURE THEY GET THE CARE THEY NEED. OKAY THANK YOU AND THE APPRECIATE YOU POINTING OUT THAT- A PRE ACA THAT. A LOT OF MONEY IN SYSTEM ONE WASN'T GOING TO CARE. SO DC COOPER- APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ON MEDIC CAL I DID NOT TOUCH ON MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE- IN A WORD COBIT NOW AND- CERTAINLY THE VIRUS ITSELF IS IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO NOT YOU KNOW THE TESTING AND THE TREATMENT. BUT ALSO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF STRESS AND STRAIN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH BURDEN. THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE OF CODED- CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO IF THE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ACA GOT OVERTURNED TO PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. SURE I'M SO. THRILLED A MEDIC CAL EXPANSION- OR OPTIONAL EXPANSION PROVIDING GET ON MEDI CAL SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS OR ADULTS WHO PREVIOUSLY WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW. ON THEY DIDN'T HAVE DEPENDENTS A GREATLY EXPANDED WHO'S ALSO GETTING MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. WILL BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE TWO DIFFERENT PIECES THE FIRST ONE IS WHEN WE EXPANDED COVERAGE FOR THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS WE'VE ADDED THE MILD TO MODERATE SERVICES THOSE ARE THE- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. ON THAT IS SOMEONE WHO IS EXPERIENCING ANXIETY. DEPRESSION I'M NEEDS COUNSELING SERVICES AND MEDICATION MANAGEMENT I'M THAT WAS ADDED THROUGH THE ACA- IT IS SO CRITICAL ESPECIALLY IN TIME. OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY TO ENSURE OUR BENEFICIARIES BOTH CHILDREN. YOUTH AND ADULTS ARE HAVING ACCESS. TO THAT MILD TO MODERATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. WE CRITICAL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU STILL OF. WHO PREVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO NOT ONLY ALL BENEFITS BY BENEFITING OF JOINING MEDIC CAL BUT SPECIFICALLY I'M MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. CRITICAL IN ADDITION BY ADDING IN THE ADULT INTENT INTO MEDIC HOW THOSE WHAT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN CALLED CHILDLESS ADULTS AND INTO MEDIC HOW ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN YOUR HIGHER ACUITY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES THAT ARE COUNTIES OVERSEE. SO THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER HAD ACCESS TO SUCH CRITICAL SERVICES ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF A PROBATE AND WE AGREED THAT IS SO CRITICAL TO ENSURE PEOPLE ARE HAVING ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES. AND THOSE COULD BE YOU KNOW PUT IN SEVERE JEOPARDY- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND INCREASED DEMAND BOB WOULD MEAN THAT THOSE TRANSITION IF WE WERE NO LONGER PROVIDING NUMBER PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE HEALTH. IT WOULD SWITCH TO THE NON MEDICAL PROGRAMS THAT COUNTIES OVER FEET OVERSEE FOR YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THEY MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ON TO FUND THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS EITHER HARD DECISIONS THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE IN THE FUTURE- WHEN IT IS COVERED TODAY. IT IS EIGHT A RIGHT FOR INDIVIDUALS IN OUR MEDIC HOW TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL LEVELS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. I'M IN WE REALLY JUST CAN'T FATHOM A FUTURE ON WHERE WHERE THAT'S NOT A RIGHT AND INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY ON THOSE WHO ARE HIT HARDEST OFTEN ON BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND THOSE WHO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD POTENTIALLY TO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES. IF THEY WERE NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH MEDICARE- SO IT COULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT IN REGARDS TO ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE. USE DISORDER SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. I KNOW THANK YOU SO MUCH JESSICA. AND THAT FIRST OF ALL AT THE BASE. PRE COATED HAD CERTAINLY TREMENDOUS DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH. BUT WITH COVETED AND- IN SOMETIMES PEOPLE JOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW I'LL CALL USES UP WITH COVE IT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT- ANXIETY DEPRESSION IS UP AND- SUBSTANCE USE THIS OP. AND SO- BY REPEALING THE ACA WE ACTUALLY- REDUCE THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO GET. THE NEEDED SERVICES HELP THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH. THE CURRENT SITUATION. AND FINALLY FOR A BEN JOHNSON AT IT AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION- I DO WANT FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THE PREVENTION FUNDING YOU'D MENTIONED AT THE END. YOU KNOW THE ACA DID ESTABLISH THE PREVENTION FUND ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S CUT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THIS WHICH WOULD HAVE PERHAPS MADE US BETTER PREPARED TO FACE COATED- BUT THEY'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT LEFT- CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO IF THEY SEE IS OVERTURNED IN THE PREVENTION. OF THE PREVENTION PUBLIC HEALTH FUND WAS THEN ELIMINATED HOW-WOULD THAT IMPACT OUR- ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO COBIT. I'M ABSOLUTELY SEVEN THE PUBLIC PREVENTION PUBLIC HEALTH FUND HAS HISTORICALLY FUNDED- CERTAIN- CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND LABORATORY CAPACITY IN THE STATE AS WELL AS HAS GENERALLY SUPPORTED IMMUNIZATIONS ALL WORK WHICH IS ALL GOING TO BE CRITICAL CAPACITY FOR CONTINUING TO. MEET THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF ADDRESSING THAT CORONAVIRUS SOME ENDEMIC HERE INTO THE FUTURE. SO THE WELL THE FUNDING IS NOT NECESSARILY THE SORT OF LARGEST COMPONENT OR THE LARGEST RISK IT WOULD SORT OF CHALLENGE THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE THE SORT OF. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MANY HAVE QUESTIONS SORT OF WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY RESOURCE TO BEGIN WITH SO. ABSOLUTELY THERE IS A- AND- THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE REDUCTION IN THIS FUNDING SOURCE WHICH IS AMONG THE MOST FLEXIBLE FUNDING SOURCES THAT- IT PARTIALLY FUNDS A BLOCK GRANT THAT THE STATE CAN FLEXIBLY FLEXIBLY DEPLOY. TO MEET THE PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES OF THE DAY- IF THAT WERE TO GO AWAY IT WOULD FURTHER STRAIN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU. RIGHT IS ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS C. NO HANDS UP RIGHT SO AGAIN I WANT THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL SO AGAIN I THINK PETER LEAVE FROM COVERED CALIFORNIA DC COOPER STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR AND THEN JOHNSON FROM LET'S THAT ALICE OFFICE THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. NOW TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL WHERE WE CAN HEAR FROM. THREE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THE MERE YOU DID- FROM SAN DIEGO. ANGELA EILERS FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND- CAROUSEL FROM SACRAMENTO SO LET'S START WITH THE MERIT DID- YOU CAN SPEAK TO YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THE ACA AS A CONSUMER. HI THERE HOW ARE YOU GUYS GOOD WE CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU GREAT SO- THE HEADLINE FOR MY STORY IS THAT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I WAS ONE YEAR OUT OF HAVING EMPLOYER COVERAGE. WHEN I LEFT- THE TEACHING PROFESSION TO MOVEMENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP SO I STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS I PURCHASED HEALTH PLAN ON THE COVER CALIFORNIA EXCHANGE AND IN SEPTEMBE OF TWENTY FIFTEEN I WAS IAGNOSED WITH A VERY RARE SOFT TISSUE TUMOR. AND WITHIN. THIRTY DAYS I RACKED UP A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MEDICAL BILLS. WHICH CHIU SURGERIES TO HOSPITAL STAYS ALL KINDS OF. IF IT'S IMAGING AND OTHER PRETTY INTENSIVE- MEDICAL CARE NOT REALLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND SO THE REASON WHY YOU SEE A HOLLOW SO IMPACTFUL FOR ME IS THAT HAD I NOT BEEN ON A SUBSIDIZED PLAN RESPOND COVERED CALIFORNIA I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY TO THOSE MEDICAL BILLS SO EVEN AFTER. THE NEGOTIATED RATE HAD KICKED IN FOR MY SERVICES THAT I USE-I OWED MY- CARE PROVIDERS FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HAVING LEFT A STABLE JOB TO MOVE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP I DIDN'T HAVE FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS LYING AROUND READY TO GO. AND SO TO GO BACK TO WHAT SENATOR MINING OTHERS TALK ABOUT THE ANNUAL CAPS WERE REALLY IMPACTFUL FOR ME WITH THE ACA SO IN THAT CASE I HAD AN OUT OF POCKET MAX OF SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND WHILE THAT WAS NOT YOU KNOW EASY I SENT A TEXT RIGHT YOU SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PAINFUL THAN TRYING TO COME UP WITH FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THE OTHER THING SINCE THAT TIME IS THAT BECAUSE THIS TUMOR THAT I HAD- I'LL BE CLEAR FOR FIVE YEARS AS OF SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR BY THIS TUMOR CAN RECUR SOMETIMES DECADES LATER AND SO I A REQUIRE. CITY FOLLOW UP INCLUDING- MRI DOT MIND COLLEGES ORDERS FOR ME AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING THAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE GUARANTEED ISSUE- I VERY WELL MAY BE DENIED COVERAGE FOR THIS IF WE GO BACK TO A PRE ACA. I'M NOT A MEDICAL INSURANCE AND SO FOR ME I THINK THE KEY PILLARS IN THE MOMENT. THAT WERE INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL WERE ON THE IN YOU'LL ARE OUT OF POCKET MAX I'M THAT THAT REALLY SAVED ME THERE AND THEN SINCE THEN IT'S BEEN GUARANTEED ISSUE- AS WELL AS LIKE THE COMMUNITY RATED BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I DON'T PURCHASE A PLAN ON THE EXCHANGE ANYMORE. ON OUR BUSINESS HAS GROWN NOW AND WERE ON WERE WE ARE A SMALL BUSINESS PLAN NOW ON THROUGH OUR BENEFITS ADMINISTRATOR BUT I'M IF WE GO BACK TO THAT IF I DIDN'T. WORK MY CURRENT COMPANY I'D BE EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION OF NEEDING TO GET INSURANCE AND. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND IT'LL EILERS. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS IT IS AN HONOR TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY I SIT HERE AS ONE MOM OF ONE CHILD WITH SERIOUS MEDICAL COMPLEXITIES BUT I KNOW I REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES JUST LIKE MINE THROUGHOUT OUR GREAT STATE. I DO HOPE I HONOR THEM ALL WELL MY NAME IS ANGELA EILERS AND I MIGHT HIS MOM MY GUESS IS THE THIRD CHILD BORN TO US AFTER CENTS WINS. I HAD REALLY HOPED THAT I WOULD HAVE A GIRL AFTER TWO RAMBUNCTIOUS BOYS. I AM SO LUCKY THEN THAT CAME TRUE. MY GOD ALONG WITH HER TWO OLDER BROTHERS ARE MY SOUL. THEY ARE EVERYTHING TO ME AND THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY. MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN ON A THURSDAY NIGHT IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINE THREE WEEKS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AFTER HAVING TWO BOYS SENT STRAIGHT TO THE NICK YOU AFTER THEIR BIRTH IT WAS A NICE CHANGE OF PACE TO HAVEOUR BABY IN OUR ROOM TO CUDLE AND LOVE ON. IMMEDIATELY MY GUESS TROUBLED A LOT THOSE FIRST FEW DAYS. BY HER BIRTHDAY AND LYFT USE DIAGNOSIS OF THE CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANT FOR HER OR HER FAMILY. I DIDN'T REALIZE AND THE REAL ACOSTA RIGHT WE JUST UNMARKED ON. AT MY GUESS SPENT A FEW WEEKS IN THE NICK YOU LEARNING TO EAT ON HER OWN. WHEN SHE WAS FINALLY ABLE TO COME HOME WE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AND FELT OUR FAMILY WAS COMPLETE AND WE CAN BEGIN LEVINE AS A FAMILY OF FIVE. WE HAD ORDERS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGISTS. HER HEART- MINOR HEART MURMUR TURNED OUT TO NOT BE SO MINOR. BY THREE HAPPENS ALL MAKE IT WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF FAILING TO THRIVE. HER CARDIOLOGISTS DECIDED THAT AT THAT POINT. SHE WOULD NEED INTERVENTION. MIKE HAD HER FIRST OPEN HEART SURGERY I NEVER KNEW A TINY BABY COULD HAVE THAT MANY TEAMS AND WIRES CONNECTED TO HER LITTLE BODY BUT THERE WE WERE SEEN AT FIRST HAND. WE LIVE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IN FEAR FEAR LOSING HER BABY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AS HER FIRST SURGERY HAD NOT DONE ENOUGH TO REPAIR HER CARDIAC ISSUES. MIKE UNDERWENT HER SECOND OPEN HEART SURGERY AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN MONTHS OLD WITH ANOTHER STATE AND THE CARDIOTHORACIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. BEFORE HER FIRST BIRTHDAY SHE HAD HIT ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MEDICAL EXPENSES. WHICH IS HALFWAY TO THE STANDARD LIFETIME CAP OF THE MILLION DOLLARS. AT THIS POINT I WAS A STAY AT HOME MOM AND MY HUSBAND WAS EMPLOYED AT A SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED COMPANY WHO OFFERED EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH CARE. NAY NONE ABSENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN UNTIL THREE YEARS LATER WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS LAID OFF FROM HIS JOB. WITH IT WHEN OUR HEALTH INSURANCE. AND I WAS DEVASTATED WE VIEWED OUR HEALTH CARE AS ESSENTIAL TO OUR FAMILY AS A WHOLE OVER OUR HEADS AND FOOD ON OUR TABLE. WITHOUT IT OUR DAUGHTER WOULD NOT SURVIVE RIGHT. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS ENACTED. JUST A FEW YEARS PRIOR MY HUSBAND DECIDED TO VENTURE OUT ON HIS OWN AND START HIS OWN BUSINESS. WE KNEW WE COULD PURCHASE OUR OWN HEALTH CARE PLAN BECAUSE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT GUARANTEED AS A PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS COULD NOT BE DENIED COVERAGE. MICHAEL IS A LIFE OF ANY OTHER LITTLE GIRL SHE'S IN THE FIFTH GRADE AND SHE ACTUALLY STARTED HER HYBRID LEARNING TODAY. SHE LOVES READING AND IS OBSESSED WITH HARRY POTTER. SHE'S THE GIRL SCOUT WHO LEFT HER TRUE AND AS FOR TRIPS TOP COOKIE SELLER THIS PAST YEAR. SHE PERFORMS AN ICE SKATING COMPETITIONS AN AERIAL SHOWCASES. SHE LOVES HER FRIENDS HER PARENTS AND HER BACKYARD FAMILY BARBECUES. SHE HAS TAKEN OUT BAKING AND TENNIS. AND I SAY ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE. SHE HAS LIVED THIS LIFE BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SHE SEES A TEAM OF DOCTORS FROM CARDIOLOGY TO NEUROLOGY- AND ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS SHE NEEDS AN MRI EVERY SIX TO NINE MONTHS. AND I KNOW HOW MUCH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE APPOINTMENTS COSTS. AND THE ACA IS A LIFELINE FOR US BECAUSE MY CAN'T BE DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE OF HER PRE EXISTING CONDITION AND SHE CANNOT BE DROPPED FROM COVERAGE. FOR EXCEEDING A LIFETIME CAP. I'M GREAT FOR THIS. I WORRY EVERY DAY WHAT WHAT TO MY FAMILY AND MY CHILD. SO THIS LAW BE RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL AT THE SUPREME COURT. I KNOW WHAT IT HAS MEANT FOR US AND HOW IT HAS BENEFITED US- AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH AND FINALLY WE HAVE A CAROUSEL. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN IT'S NICE TO SPEAK WITH ALL OF YOU AGAIN- I LIVE WITH ACTUAL SPINAL ARTHRITIS DEPRESSION ANXIETY PTSD AND AUTISM. AND AS A NOTE I USE THEY THEM PRONOUNS. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I LEARNED THAT I HAD THE SAME DISEASE AS MY DAD AFTER DOCTORS COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. AS A FORMER COLLEGE ATHLETE THIS NEWS TURNED MY WORLD UPSIDE DOWN. THE DISEASE ACTUAL SPANO ARTHRITIS IS A LIFELONG CONDITION THAT CAN CAUSE SPINAL FUSION AND DAMAGE OTHER JOINTS AND ORGANS IT'S PAINFUL EXHAUSTING AND PROGRESSIVE. AND-PATIENTS NEED ROUTINE SPECIALIZED TREATMENT AND CARE. SO I KNEW I HAD THIS DISEASE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A DIAGNOSIS AND I DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. AND THE ACA WAS EIGHT MONTHS AWAY. I COULD BARELY FUNCTION SO I NEEDED TO BEGIN TREATMENT SOON BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE FOR HAVING A PRE EXISTING CONDITION. I NEEDED INSURANCE FIRST. SO I APPLIED FOR A BARE BONES PLAN ON A PART TIME SALARY AND WHEN AN INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE INTERVIEWED ME ABOUT ANY HEALTH ISSUES. I LIED. I TOLD HER MY HEALTH WAS GREAT. I LIED MY WAY INTO CHEAP HEALTH INSURANCE. MY PLAN HAD HIGH COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES. WHEN I SAW A RHEUMATOLOGIST FOR THE FIRST TIME I BEGGED HIM TO DIAGNOSE ME BASED SOLELY ON MY SYMPTOM HISTORY AND AN OFFICE VISIT EVEN THOUGH BLOOD WORK AND X. RAYS WERE REQUIRED. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRIEVING THIS LIFE CHANGING DIAGNOSIS INSTEAD I WAS STILL VERY SICK AND BEING FORCED TO MAKE CHOICES THAT PUT MY HEALTH AT RISK LIKE SAYING NO THE NECESSARY TRUE TESTS AND MONITORING. I ABSOLUTELY DON'T WISH MY EXPERIENCE ON ANYONE. WHEN THE ACA ARRIVED I GOT A SUBSIDIZED PLAN THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA I CAN FINALLY GET ADEQUATE CARE WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THE COST I COULD AFFORD MEDICATIONS IMAGING AND BLOOD WORK I CAN GET PHYSICAL THERAPY AND SEE A PSYCHIATRIST AND I COULDN'T BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF MY UNDERLYING CONDITION. LATER WHEN I HAD TO STOP WORKING I WAS AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. THANKS TO THE MEDICARE MEDICAID EXPANSION AND I HAD ACCESS TO IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO HELP ME LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. TODAY I AM ON FEDERAL DISABILITY AND I RECEIVED BOTH MEDICAL AND MEDICARE. THE ACA DEFINITELY ISN'T PERFECT BUT REPEALING IT OR PORTIONS OF IT IS LITERALLY A DEATH SENTENCE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING A LOT OF MY OWN FRIENDS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I SHOULD BE DOING IS CARING FOR MY HEALTH. NOT CONTINUING THE FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS HAVE HEALTH CARE AS I HAD TO DO FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. PLEASE DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO FIGHT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME TO HAVE QUALITY RELIABLE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR SHARING YOUR VERY PERSONAL STORIES- THE TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER MINING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO JOIN YOU IN THINKING. THESE THREE WITNESSES FOR SHARING THEIR THEIR STORIES IN THE COURAGE. THEY'VE MANIFEST NOT JUST IN BEING PUBLIC TODAY BUT- THROUGH THEIR- RESPECTIVE FROM PATHWAYS- TRYING TO SEEK HEALTH CARE AND MAINTAIN HEALTH FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND I THINK. IT COMES FROM THIS TESTIMONY FOR ME. IS FOR PEOPLE FIGHT FOR ACCESS FOR MEDICAL COVERAGE THERE IS CLEARLY A PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT FOR THE FOR THOSE THAT LIVE IN THE UNCERTAINTY OF NOT KNOWING IF THEIR PLAN WILL COVER. THEIR CONDITION IF THEY WILL MAX OUT ON COVERAGE LIMITS IT SATCHER AND WHILE E'VE HEARD SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT THE ACA ALSO EXPANDING COVERAGE TO INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- NO AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE TO ADD TO THE TRAUMA OF. OF HEALTH CHALLENGES THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHETHER THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO NOT REALLY A QUESTION FOR PANEL MEMBERS BUT MAYBE JUST ENCOURAGEMENT THAT YOU CONTINUE TO SHARE YOUR STORIES- IF THERE'S WRITTEN FORM OF THE TESTIMONY YOU GAVE TODAY SHARING THAT WITH OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. IN MAY BE SENDING IT TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND I DON'T KNOW IF MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT TAKE PERSONAL MAIL BUT I WOULD SEND YOUR STORIES TO MEMBERS OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT AS WELL IN AGAIN. WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE IS SO GREAT AND IT GOES BEYOND JUST ACCESSING TREATMENT FOR ILLNESS AND DISEASE BUT THE VERY MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR STATE AND OUR NATION SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY STRONG TESTIMONY ALL THREE OF YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MINING FOR THE REMOTE MEMBERS IF YOU WISH TO. MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND I SEE NO HANDS RAISED AT THE MOMENT- I JUST. YES HAVE OCCURRED WELL QUESTION FOR ALL THREE IN A WAY ALTHOUGH WITH THE- WELL THINGS WE TALK ABOUT WITH THE ACA IS- THAT- WHAT WE DIFFICULT TO REFERENCE OF JOB LOCK RIGHT SO IF YOU HAPPEN A LOT WORK FOR A LARGE COMPANY. YOUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GO OFF AND START YOUR OWN BUSINESS- IS LIMITED BY THE FACT THAT WITH YOUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNER- OR YOUR EMPLOYEE OF A SMALL BUSINESS. OFTENTIMES THE UNDERWRITING WOULD CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS BE ABLE TO GET HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE POOL OF EMPLOYEES AND I'M A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OF FAT THAT FACED THE FACT THAT ONE TURNS COMPANY WE WANT TO OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE TO ARE. A SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES THEY'RE LOOKING HAD A VERY VERY SMALL POOL AND SEEING IF SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSE GIVE PERHAPS- GIVEN SOME OF YOUR EXPERIENCES- WE HAVE MARY DAVID AND ANGELA EILERS AND I KNOW CARES YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. FIGURES TO IS A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S. AN HOW DO YOU SEE THE ACA. IN ADDITION TO ALLOWING YOU TO INTO. ALSO YOU MORE FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE. THINGS IN TERMS OF YOUR- CAREER YOUR JOB- COMPARED TO PRE ACA WHERE- YOU YOU WOULDN'T. HAVE THOSE OPTIONS PERHAPS BECAUSE OF YOUR MEDICAL BECAUSE OF YOUR CONDITION OR YOUR CHILD'S CONDITION. I LOOK TO JUMP IN ON THE STATE'S OKAY SENATOR DONNELLY'S SO AGAIN THIS IS IN AMERICA- YOU KNOW YOUR QUESTION IS A PROVOCATIVE ONE IN MY CASE I WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT MY PRIOR CAREER STARTED TO AN ENTIRELY NEW CAREER- HOW DOES NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO GET COVERAGE. BY ANY CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA SO IN THAT CASE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY A CATALYST FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP ON MY PART- I CAN'T SAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN PERFECT BUT I LEFT THAT CAREER SIX YEARS AGO AND NOW. I'M OUR COMPANY EMPLOYS TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE AND SO THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE STABILITY THAT THE DCA IN THE COVER CALIFORNIA EXCHANGE OFFERED SOMEONE LIKE ME REALLY HAS CHANGED WHAT HAS BEEN MY LIFE MY CAREER AND ALSO FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE EMPLOY. AND I THINK THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS CAN EITHER BE A DRIVER FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN MY CASE WERE HAD THIS NOT BEEN THE LAW PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A HINDRANCE AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN START DOING SOMETHING WORKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE THAT YOU CAN PLAY PEOPLE IN. BUSINESS I'M REALLY PROUD TO RUN. THANK YOU. THE OTHER WITNESSES WONDER. US SENATOR I CAN SPEAK TO THAT- EVEN THOUGH MY STORY IS DIFFERENT- THE MEDICAID EXPANSION ACTUALLY ALLOWED ME TO STOP WORKING- MY HEALTH WAS- GETTING SO BAD THAT I WAS ONLY GOING TO WORK AND THEN COLLAPSING AS SOON AS I GOT HOME BUT BECAUSE OF MY ABILITY TO SORT OF MAINTAIN AND MANAGE MY HEALTH BETTER ON MEDICAID- I WAS ABLE TO BEGIN FREELANCING AND DOING WRITING WHICH IS A PASSION OF MINE SO IT ALLOWED ME TO WORK. IN A WAY THAT I COULD ACTUALLY MANAGE RATHER THAN BEING PUSHED INTO. A MAKING MY HEALTH WORSE BY WORKING A REGULAR JOB. THANK YOU CARES AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT REMINDER THAT ACTUALLY MANY OF THE PEOPLE ON MEDICARE NOW ACTUALLY ARE EMPLOYED OR DO WORK- I THINK SOMETIMES THERE'S A MISNOMER THAT PEOPLE ARE MEDIC CAL- ALL OF THAT THEY'RE NOT WORKING AT ALL ACTUALLY VAST MAJORITY OF THE HOME. ADULTS ACTUALLY HAVE SOME FORM OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT OR- OR OTHER TYPES OF WORK. OKAY AND ANY OTHER COMMENTS SIR QUESTIONS. I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS UP. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN EACH OF. OUR OUR CONSUMER TEST FIRES- NEARLY DID ANGELA EILERS AND CAROUSEL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORIES HERE WITH OUR- COMMITTEE AND- AT THIS HEARING AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. FOR YOURSELVES AND YOUR FAMILIES AND YOUR CHILD. AND HOPEFULLY COMMONSENSE WILL PREVAIL AND- WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE AC AFFORDED AND ACTUALLY IMPROVE ON THEM AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS- AS WE GO FORWARD SO WE CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TAKE CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON DOWN TO OUR NEXT PANEL OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WE HAVE JENNIFER. PACHINKO SCO RETTKE. RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM MEDICAL CENTER CLINICS- RESTING HOSPITALS WE HAVE LESLIE OF ASTOR COMING C. OF LIVINGSTON HEALTH CENTER MERCED COUNTY REVERSING THE FEE CLINICS. AND BETH GRIFFITHS. THIS CLINICAL PROFESSOR DIVISION INTERNAL MEDICINE AT UCSF WHO IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSING FROM- AT THE PER PROVIDER HEALTH CARE- PHYSICIAN PERSPECTIVES SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE JENNIFER OF CRUIKSHANK WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. IN THIS HEARING TOGETHER TODAY I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM IS A MAJOR SAFETY NET PROVIDER IN OUR COMMUNITY IF FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THAT LEVEL TWO TRAUMA CENTER SERVING ADULTS YEAH. THANK YOU AFTER CONVERGENCE IAN THANK YOU AFTER CAN PATIENT CARE. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE THIRTY SIX PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CANNOT CLINICS LOCATED ACROSS THE COUNTY. BEING OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PATIENTS ANNUALLY OF WHICH 70% ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE. 78% REPRESENT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SPECIFICALLY THE MEDICAID EXPANSION HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL FOR OUR PATIENTS AND OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM MORE THAN FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEDICARE EXPANSION INDIVIDUALS. ARE RECEIVING THEIR PRIMARY CARE AT ARE YOU A- BUT MORE PEOPLE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS OUR ENERGY ON IMPROVING CARE PATIENTS THESE. OUTCOMES IN COORDINATION. SOME EXAMPLES ARE EXPANDING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE BY OPENING NEW SITES ACROSS THE COUNTY INCLUDING A CLINIC THAT WILL BE OPENING INCOMES X. SHARE. HELLO KIDDING PRIMARY CARE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IMPROVING COMPLEX CARE MANAGEMENT BY EMBEDDING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. EDITOR'S INTO OUR TEAMS REDUCE UNNECESSARY HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY FROM THAT THAT. HE'S EVER IMPROVING UP AGAINST AND HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENT. IN FACT WE ARE TOP PERFORMERS UP OUR MEDICARE PAY FOR PERFORMANCE AS YOURS MY PRIME PROGRAM. WE ARE SCREENING MORE THAN 90% OF OUR PATIENTS FOR DEPRESSION THEREBY POSITIVELY IMPACTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PATIENTS LIVE. RATER THAN 90% COMPLIANCE WITH PRE AND POSTNATAL CARE IMPROVES THE SECTOR RIGHT BREAST FEEDING AND LEVERAGING TELEHEALTH AND ALL THESE SERVICES AND ACT ON THEM HERE. ARE YOU IT IS COMPLETED THOUSANDS OF FOCUS DISPARITY REDUCTION ASSESSMENT IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HELP REDUCE. EACH RACE SB. THANK IS. THE OF THE MEDICAID EXPANSION COULD UNDERMINE ALL OF THIS WORK RESULTING IN MASSIVE FINANCIAL LOSSES OUR SYSTEM AND HARM OUR LOW INCOME PATIENT POPULATION. ARE YOU AND ARE YOU ARE YOU H. US ALONE COULD LOSE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS INCLUDES ALL OF THE PATIENT CARE REVENUE AND SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING WE RECEIVED FOR THIS POPULATION. THAT WASN'T FUNNY WOULD COMPROMISE HOW WE DELIVER CARE TO STABILIZE ACTS WITH. SORRY TWENTY STABILIZE ACCESS TO SERVICE FOUR THOUSAND THAT WOULD REQUIRE REDUCE OPTIONS FOR CARE IMPORTANTLY CLOSE CLINICS ELIMINATION OF THE ACA WOULD ALSO HAVE BRUTAL EFFECTS IN OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ESTIMATED RIVERSIDE COUNTY COULD LOSE EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN GDP AND AN ESTIMATED TWELVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS COULD LOSE THEIR JOB. LET ME CONCLUDE WITH THE PATIENT STORY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THREE YEAR OLD SINGLE MOTHER UNDERWENT A MAMMOGRAM AND ULTRASOUND DETECTED BREAST CANCERS THEY SHOULD BEGIN TREATMENT WITH US AND THEN ROLLED IN MEDICARE. TODAY SHE CONTINUES THAT TREATMENT. AND I NEED TO BE HELD HOMES PROGRAM. AND GETTING WEEKS HERBAL MAN. AS WELL AS WORKING WITH IMMIGRATION TO FACILITATE GETTING HER APPEARANCE HERE TO HELP HER TAKE CARE FOR MENTORING HER THREE. HAD SHE BEEN RELUCTANT TO SEEK CARE BECAUSE SHE WAS UNINSURED THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT AND HER YOUNG CHILDREN WILL LIKELY BE WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER'S DAY. REFUNDABLE PATIENTS WHO OFTEN FACE MANY HURDLES. HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THROUGH MEDICAID- IS OFTEN A DEFINING FACTOR THAT ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUAL TO STAY HEALTHY ENOUGH. AND GET YOUR NEED WITHOUT BREAKING THE- ANY MEDICARE LITERALLY CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE AGING CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY TO SOCIETY ARE BECOMING LAST AND FINANCIALLY DESTITUTE. A LIMITATION OF THE MEDICAID EXPANSION WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO OUR HEALTH SYSTEM AND THE VERY PATIENTS WITH THEIR IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE BUILDING ON THIS PROGRESS. FURTHER IMPROVE ACCESS BODY NOW COMES FOR OUR PATIENTS I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS DISCUSSION TODAY AND WILL SUPPORT HIM IN THE QUESTIONS FOLLOWING HIM. THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THE EX. OF THIS MOVEMENT TO LESLIE ABBAS THE COMINGS FROM. VIDEO BUILDINGS AND HEALTH CENTER WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW ME TO SPEAK TODAY I'M TO GET SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE ACA AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE IT PLAYS IN SUPPORTING ACCESS TO CARE. HI MY NAME IS LESLIE RUSTIC CUMMINGS AND I AM THE CEO FOR LIVINGSTON COMMUNITY HEALTH CLEAR AND NONPROFIT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER PROVIDING THE CARE I YOU OVER TWENTY THOUSAND YOU NEED PATIENCE AND THAT COUNTIES THAT MERCED STANISLAUS COUNTY SO AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. I'M HAD THE PROPER NUMBER AND CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES IN THE COUNTY BOARD MEMBER FOR THE CENTRAL. CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH. THANK YOU IMPORTANT INCLUDE THE PERSON. I COMMUNITY HEALTH AND BECAUSE WE VERY MUCH BELIEVE THAT WE ARE- I'M AT EIGHT ESSENTIAL PART OF THE BACKBONE OF THE SPEAKING AT CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM CALIFORNIA. ENSURING THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO MEDICAL OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ORAL HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES AND SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND I'M IN A LOT OF CASES AS WELL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TO DATE THERE ARE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDING. HIGH QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE CARE AND- AS THAT MISCUE BURKE POINTED OUT FROM DH CS AND THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION OF THOSE ARE ADULTS ENROLLED IN MEDICAID HOW. WE ARE DELIVERING HERE TO SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDING OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WHICH. IS ROUGHLY ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIANS. FOR THE CAN IS THAT ARE CENTERS. MY HEALTH AND MANY OTHERS ON THE EIGHTEEN IS JUST AND UNDENIABLE SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED ACROSS ALL RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. I THINK IT IS GREAT WHAT THE GREATEST GAINS SEEN AMONG THOSE- IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY. BECAUSE OF THE ACA HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED AS SIXTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS CANNOT BE DENIED COVERAGE. AND ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ARE NOW PROVIDING CARE 254% OR ONE POINT THREE MILLION. NEW PATIENTS ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA'S. MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS. DESPITE AND I. FEDERAL CAL CONTINUES TO SUCCESSFULLY ENROLL LOW INCOME CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. INTO MEDICARE FOR HEALTH COVERAGE. THEIR FINANCIAL SUCCESS THE FINANCIAL SUCCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACA GAVE US AND CONTINUES TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR SERVICES MUCH LIKE JENNIFER CHRISTIAN PUT JUST POINTED OUT IN HER PRESENTATION AS WELL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME HERE WHEN THE MEDIA THAT I'M HAVING THE ACA AND PLACE ALSO PREPARED US FOR TODAY TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE THROUGH THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND ALLOWED US TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO HIT OUR OPERATIONS TO MAINTAIN CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE NOT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE YOU PROVIDE THIS CARE WITHOUT THE BENEFITS OF TELEHEALTH. AND ALSO THE ABILITY TO HAVE BEEN ALLOW GREATER FLEXIBILITY DURING THAT DECLARE AN EMERGENCY THE MEDIC HOW POPULATION. AT THE HEALTH HOME TO SO MANY MEDICARE COVERAGE CREATED THE TRUSTED. RELATIONSHIPS NEEDED FOR COVER NINETEEN TESTING AND FOLLOW UP CARE. FINALLY REPEALING THE ACA WOULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT COST BARRIERS FOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS HEALTHCARE WHICH MEANS THAT MANY. BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WILL LIKELY LOSE COVERAGE AND STOP RECEIVING NON EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE. WHEN MEDICARE COVERAGE LINKED TO A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN HOW WE ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY TWO FACTORS LINKED TO COPE IN NINETEEN SEVERITY AND MORTALITY IN ACA REPEAL WOULD MAKE IT NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO RESERVE RESERVE REVERSED. THE INEQUITABLE INEQUITABLE BURDEN OF THAT MADE. FOR THE- FARK OVER A POTENTIALLY CA RIDICULOUS BE DENNIS TO OUR RESEARCH AND RECOVERY. THANK I JUST WANTED TO THAT FOR THIS FOR THE SIMPLE CONVERSATION. WHEN AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENT THAT CONTINUES TO THREATEN AND DESTABILIZE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE NEED TO BE INVESTING IN AND SUPPORTING BOTH COVERAGE AND ACCESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS TODAY. THANKS VERY MUCH. OF YOUR TESTIMONY AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE DOCTOR BETH GRIFFITHS- FROM THE DEPARTMENT DIVISION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE AT UCSF. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR PAN AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTE ABOUT THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF ACA REPEAL FOR PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I'M A GENERAL INTERNIST AT UCSF AND PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE FOR ADULTS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND BEYOND I CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH NEARLY EVERY TYPE OF INSURANCE MEDIKAL MEDICARE COVERED CALIFORNIA AND EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT JOYS OF MY PRACTICE THAT I CAN PROVIDE THE SAME KIND OF CARE TO ALL OF MY PATIENTS FROM MY PATIENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO MY PATIENTS WHO ARE DEANS AND CEOS. WITHOUT THE ACA THIS TYPE OF PRACTICE IN WHICH EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE SAME QUALITY OF CARE AND MOST OF THE SAME TESTING AND SUBSPECIALISTS SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE COUNTLESS OTHER PHYSICIAN PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE SIMILARLY DEVASTATED. MUCH HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID TODAY ABOUT THE CATASTROPHE THAT WOULD ENSUE IF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MEDICAID EXPANSION. AND SUBSIDIES FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE ACA'S MANY PROTECTIONS WERE TAKEN AWAY. THE CONSEQUENCES OF PEOPLE NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO ACCESS ANY MEDICAL CARE ARE PERHAPS MORE OBVIOUS SO I HOPE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SLIGHTLY MORE SUBTLE DEVASTATION. BEFORE THE ACA MUCH OF THE CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW INSURED UNDER MEDICAID EXPANSION WAS PROVIDED ON AN EMERGENCY ONLY BASIS. FOR NEARLY ENTIRELY AT COUNTY HOSPITALS AND FREE CLINICS. I HAVE WORKED IN ALL OF THESE SETTINGS AND I FIRST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TREMENDOUS PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE CARE AND THEM AND THE EXCEPTIONAL CARE OFTEN PROVIDED. HOWEVER IN A PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE SUCH AS MINE WE OFTEN SAVE LIVES NOT IN DRAMATIC MADE FOR TV WAYS. BUT THROUGH CARE AND TRUST BUILT OVER YEARS. ASKING SOMEONE TO CHANGE THEIR DOCTOR OR HEALTH SYSTEM AFTER LOSING COVERAGE IS NO SMALL THING. EVEN IF THERE WERE ONE TO ACCEPT THEM. MANY OF MY PATIENTS TO HAVE MEDICAL HAVE COME TO ME FOR A REASON MANY HAVE A HISTORY OF TRAUMA. AND SEEKING CARE AT THE COUNTY HOSPITAL THAT IS ALSO THE TRAUMA CENTER AN ARRANGEMENT VERY COMMON IN CALIFORNIA BRINGS UP ENOUGH TRAUMA THAT THEY WOULD AVOID CARE IF THIS WERE THE ONLY OPTION. WITH RAMPANT UNEMPLOYMENT RELATED TO THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE SEEN THE CONFUSION. STRESS AND IMPACT ON HEALTH WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNEXPECTEDLY FORCED TO CHANGE INSURANCE OR LOSE INSURANCE ALTOGETHER. FROM LOSING A DOCTOR YOU FINALLY COME TO TRUST. TO FIGURING OUT NEW RULES ABOUT WHICH PRESCRIPTIONS ARE COVERED. AND WHICH ARE NOT. IF THE ACA'S REPEALED THIS CHAOS WOULD AFFECT MILLIONS MORE CALIFORNIANS AND LEAVE THEM WITH MANY FEWER OPTIONS TO TURN TO. AND WHILE CRUCIAL INSURANCE COVERAGE IS ONLY PART OF THE EQUATION. IF CALIFORNIANS TO SUCCEED IN PROVIDING QUALITY AFFORDABLE CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WE CANNOT AGAIN SEPARATE INSURANCE COVERAGE FROM TRUE ACCESS TO CARE. IN THIS BEING THE ACA HAS PROVIDED SUPPORT TO MANY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. IF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE NOT CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE WILL BE EXAM. AND PATIENTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS QUALITY MEDICAL CARE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR PHYSICIANS HAVE EMBRACED THE ACA I'M DOING ITS STRUCTURE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC WOULD HAVE DEVASTATING REAL LIFE CONSEQUENCES FOR MY PATIENTS AND MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE MANY OF WHOM ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS WHY ALL OF US MUST DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT AND BUILD UPON THE GAINS MADE BY THE ACA. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANKS VERY MUCH. WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS PANEL. OKAY I DON'T. SEE ANY HANDS UP FOR THE REMOTE PARTICIPANTS. JUST A VERY BRIEF FIVE QUESTION FOR- ACTUALLY I THINK BOTH- JENNIFER CRUIKSHANK AND LESLIE ABOUT THE COMINGS- SO I REALLY CAN'T CREATE ALL THE PANELISTS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE C. ON PATIENTS AND THAT SHOULD CERTAINLY ALWAYS COME FIRST- BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS SO HE JUST. IN A VERY BRIEF CANCER- SHE IS POSSIBLE SIR SAFETY AC WAS REPEALED WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO YOUR WORK FORCE AND HOW MANY JOBS DO YOU THINK YOU'D- BE WOULD BE LOST- IN IT AT YOUR FACILITY. WHICH OF COURSE HAS AN IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY- AND IF THE ISSUE WAS REPEALED. I'LL START THIS IS GEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST DIDN'T ME ENTER IT AGAIN. ARE YOU INTERESTED BE PHASING OUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR LOSS IN FUNDING FOR SERVICES THAT WE CURRENTLY PROVIDE. ENOUGH OF OUR A LITTLE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SO ABOUT 15% OF OUR BUDGET WOULD BE LAST WHICH MEANS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK BACK. AT OUR ON. THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING AND START TO EVALUATE WHICH ONES WE CAN AND CANNOT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE WE WOULD HAVE IF WE CLOSE RANKS. M. IF WE ELIMINATED SERVICES. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS BATES THAT REPORT FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEMONSTRATED THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE WITH LIZ WHILE THOUSAND. TWELVE THOUSAND POSITIONS ACROSS THE COUNTY THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN OUR REGION. AND I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR YOU ABOUT. WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR US BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY WE'D BE LOOKING AT. HOW MANY FREE HOW MUCH FREE CARE WE CAN GIVEN HOW MANY FREE PRESCRIPTONS WE CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO FILL. AND WE'RE PROVIDING A LOT OF SERVICES TO UNINSURED. AS WELL THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO. SCALE BACK THEM. BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FUNCTION. THANK YOU. THE LEGISLATIVE THE COMING YOU'RE RUNNING. OR HELLO HAVE. SO AND I THINK AND I THINK FOR US THE IMPACT WOULD ACTUALLY BE FAR GREATER AND WE EXPANDED ACCESS- NOT BUYING OVER AT THAT SIX ADDITIONAL ACCESS POINTS THAT ALL COME WITH STAFFING THAT WENT ALONG WITH EACH ONE OF THEM AND SO AND IF WE AND I IF I HAD TO PUT A PERCENTAGE TO IT OUR OUR EXPANSION OF ACCESS TO SERVICES COULD BE CLOSER 230% OF OUR BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WE WERE ABLE TO SEARCH AND THAT WAS OVER THE COURSE OF TIME FOR THAT- AFTER THE PORTAL CARE ACT. WAS PASSED ON AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD ACTUALLY RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF CLINICS REDUCTION OF OURS AND CERTAINLY LAYOFFS OF STAFF AND BECAUSE OF THE- YOU KNOW THE CUTS IN FUNDING AND THE- ACCESS FOR THOSE PATIENTS AND BE UNDER THE INCREASE IN THE UNINSURED SO FOR US IT WOULD BE- YOU KNOW BLESSED ACCESS LESS ACCESS POINTS AND MOST LIKELY EIGHT IMPACT TO. THE WORK FORCE AS LONG. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR- I WOULD JUST MAYBE. COULD WE ONE OTHER POINT BEFORE THE ON TO ALLOW TEN THIS WEEK HEARD OF THE CUT. THAT WERE HAPPEN. A ONE BE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT SO SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY WELL GEE I'M NOT A MEDIC HOW BY COVERED CALIFORNIA OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HOW DOES IT IMPACT ME BUT WHEN A PROGRAM LET'S SAY. AT RIVERSIDE- WHERE YOU KNOW PORTION THE PATIENTS ARE MEDICARE PORTION PATIENTS ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA AND THEN THEY HAVE THESE CUTS. AND A CLOSE THE PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM IS THE NIGHT NOT JUST FOR THOSE PATIENTS BEFORE ANYONE WHO LIVES IN THE AREA. ANYONE WHO LIVES IN THE AREA NO MATTER WHAT INSURANCE YOU HAVE OR HOW MUCH CASH YOU HAVE. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT PEOPLE HAVE BUILT. DEVELOP SERVICES THAT NOT JUST SERVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICARE OUT OF COURSE NEED THEM PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING COVER CALIFORNIA. THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM YOU KNOW HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND CLINICS AND OTHER NETWORKS THEY HAVE YOU KNOW. AND THEN A FIGHT AND ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THAT PERHAPS IT IS ONLY THE COMMERCIALLY INSURED. THAT WOULD THERE NOT BE ENOUGH SUPPORT. TO PATIENTS AND REVENUE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT PROGRAM COULD YOU GO BUT BECAUSE IT'S NOW THESE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE COVERAGE AND I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THAT MIND WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. SO AND LESS ANY OF THE WITNESSES WHICH TO DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT TO IN TERMS OF THEIR RUNNING THE PROGRAM WILL. WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL BUT I WANT THANK YOU EACH OF YOU. OF OUR- THE PANEL AGAIN- JENNIFER CRUIKSHANK OF RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM LESLIE ABOUT THE COMINGS. BUT THANKS AND HEALTH CENTER AND DR GRIFFITHS AT UCSF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU. RIGHT WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR PANEL. OF ADVOCATES I'M HERE SO WE HAVE A CONSUMER BUSINESS ADVOCATES AND- THE TEST FIRES ARE GEORGE- BUT TERIA CEO OF COLLECTIVE CHOICE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS- GEN FLORI HAD A POLICY ADVOCATE THE WESTERN CENTER OF LONG POVERTY A JFFREY REYNOSO EXAM DOCTOR THE LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA CHRISTIAN YOUNG POLICY ADVOCATE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND FINALLY ANTHONY WRIGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE GEORGIA ABOUT TERIA. WELCOME THANK YOU CENTER. I'M GONNA SHARE THE INSURANCE AGENT PERSPECTIVE ON ENROLLING CONSUMERS INTO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND AS I MENTIONED MY AS MENTIONED MY NAME'S GEORGE BALL TERIA AND I'M THE CEO OF COLLECTIVE CHOICE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS. WE ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH UNDERWRITERS AND AS A CERTIFIED INSURANCE AGENT- OUR AGENCY HAS ENROLLED MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE INTO COVERED CALIFORNIA AND TO MEDICARE. AND I ALSO WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT INSURANCE AGENTS HAVE BEEN ROLLED BETWEEN 47% AND 50% OF THE PEOPLE INTO COVERED CALIFORNIA THAT'S THEMSELVES. AND INSURANCE AGENTS OF ALSO BEEN THE LARGEST. NON GOVERNMENT FUNDED- IN ROLLER INTO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN OTHER WORDS WE DO THAT WORK FOR FREE- AND THEN MOST RECENTLY INSURANCE AGENTS HAVE BEEN THE LARGEST ROLLER INTO COVERED CALIFORNIA- DURING. NINETEEN AND IT'S ALL THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR OFFICES AND- WORKING WITH ALL THE DESTRUCTION HAPPEN EARLY MARCH AND APRIL- WE'VE HELPED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE- GAIN ACCESS AND NAVIGATE LOSING THEIR JOBS SPONSORED COVERAGE DURING THIS TIME SO- AND A LITTLE BACK HISTORY PRE CA- I STARTED MY CAREER AS A HEALTH INSURANCE AGENT TWO THOUSAND TWO- FOR NINE YEARS I DROVE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES PER YEAR. SEEN MORE THAN. TWO THOUSAND. IN IN THE SYSTEM GETTING AND IN PRICING DIEGO RIVERSIDE SEAMER DINO- ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES AREAS YEAH I ALSO HELP PEOPLE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OVER THE PHONE. AND I REALLY ENJOYED HAT I DID DURING THAT TIME DURING PRESEASON GAME- NAPPIES I MET A LOT OF AMAZING INTERESTING CALIFORNIANS BUT I ALSO HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND BUT THERE WAS TIMES WHERE- I RAN INTO SITUATIONS WHERE MY HANDS WERE TIED FIVE I RAN INTO A PERSONALIZATION WAS MAKING FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO AFFORDABLE OPTION FOR THAT PERSON TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE AND SO THOSE PEOPLE I JUST HAD TO SAY. I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU I RUN INTO PEOPLE LIKE THE PREVIOUS- PEOPLE SPOKE ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH CONDITIONS AND I WOULDN'T GO SEE THEM I WOULD TALK TO ME ON THE PHONE. AND THEY WOULD TELL ME YOU KNOW THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THEIR LIFE TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE SHE WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER I LOST MY JOB. AND YOU KNOW THOSE KINDS OFSITUATIONS. MY HANDS WERE TIED THAT PERSON COULD NOT GET HEALTH INSURANCE. AND YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU DO LEFT THOUSANDS OF TIMES. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I HAVE TO ALMOST EMOTIONALLY GET MYSELF BACK TO THAT PLACE WHERE I REMEMBER THOSE THINGS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE I'VE HAD TO EVEN TELL A PERSON THAT THEY COULDN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF THE ACA. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE THE WAY IDEA AND- SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE. IN THE STATE AND- TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE CA AND PLAN FOR CONTINGENCIES- AROUND IT AND I WANNA. LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW INSURANCE AGENTS I'M SOME OF THE CONSUMER ADVOCATES THERE ALSO SPEAK AFTER ME- OUR ORGANIZATION MYSELF ARE HERE TO HELP THIS COMMITTEE AND WE'RE ALSO HERE TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE AND HELPING CONSUMERS NAVIGATE THE TRANSITION OF ANY CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE. AND AS A PERSON WHO'S USED TO UNFORTUNATELY DEALING WITH A DIFFICULT- HEALTH- A QUESTIONS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE I'M NOT HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- FOLLOWING OF THE SECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THE TESTIMONY OF THE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL LET'S MOVE ON TO CHEN FLORI. POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ALLOW POVERTY. GOOD AFTERNOON AS MENTIONED I'M GENTS LAUREATES WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WHERE THE STATE'S LARGEST AND OLDEST LEGAL SERVICES SUPPORT CENTER. AND I WORKED MOST OF MY CAREER IN EITHER AT WESTERN CENTER ITSELF OR AT LEGAL SERVICES AND HELPING PEOPLE ACCESS HEALTHCARE MOTIVATED BECAUSE OF MY OWN EXPERIENCES AND NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE AND THE EXPERIENCES OF MY FAMILY. BEFORE THE ACA- THOSE OF US AT LEGAL SERVICES WHO ARE HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED ACCESS HEALTH CARE THE TYPICAL STORY WOULD GO LIKE THIS. IF YOU ENCOUNTERED ONE OF THE 20% OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WAS UNINSURED AND NEEDED HEALTH CARE. THERE WAS REALLY ONLY ONE ROUTE TO HELP THEM THE PRIVATE MARKET WAS ESSENTIALLY CLOSE TO THEM AS JUST MENTIONED BY THE SPEAKER BEFORE. AND SO FOR EVERYBODY ELSE THAT MEANT WAITING UNTIL YOU WERE CHU SICK- TO WORK AND BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T WORK YOU WERE SO POOR THAT YOU NOW QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO ACCESS COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT NEED- AS MENTIONED BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS YOU COULD GET EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE SOMETIMES CERTAIN SERVICES THREE OR COUNTY BUT- OFTEN NOT THE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE THAT YOU NEED IT- I'M GONNA GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE. ONE OF THE FIRST CASES THAT I WORKED ON AND WE WERE ACTUALLY HELPING AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ACCESS HER COUNTY HEALTH CARE PROGRAM BECAUSE SHE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A FEW DOLLARS OVER THE INCOME LIMIT BASED ON THE WAY TO CALCULATE ENTERING TOWN. AT THAT POINT SHE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH COLON CANCER. HI AND AT THE POINT THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED IT WAS. FAIRLY TREATABLE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAIRLY ROUTINE TO TAKE CARE OF. SO THROUGHOUT THE CASE WHAT WE ARE ON THE ONE HAND SUING THE COUNTY. SHE DETERIORATED VERY MUCH EVERY PHONE CALL WITH HER YOU COULD TELL SHE WASSICKER. AT THE POINT THAT ARE CANCER BECAME STAGE FOR AND SHE COULD NO LONGER WORK THEN WE COULD GET ARE ON MEDI CAL. WE WERE ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN HER CASE BUT THE SUFFERING THAT SHE WENT THROUGH IN THAT PROCESS WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE WENT THROUGH- TO GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE AND BASIS OF DISABILITY DOESN'T MEAN THAT IN ITSELF IS AN EASY DETERMINATION. IT WS OFTEN A CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GET THE DISABILITY DETERMINATION BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU NEED ACCESS TO A DOCTOR WHO CAN PROVE THAT YOU HAVE A DISABILITY- WITHOUT ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE IT BECOMES VERY HARD TO PROVE THAT- ON THE OTHER SIDE. THIS STATE THEN HAD TO PROCESS ALL OF THESE DISABILITY APPLICATIONS WE HAD ANOTHER CASE AGAINST THE STATE BECAUSE OF DISABILITY APPLICATIONS WERE BEING DELAYED BECAUSE THEY'RE SO LABOR INTENSIVE. THE STATE CAN'T JUST GIVE OUT HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY FIT THE CRITERIA BY WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD REIMBURSE THEM. ONE OF OUR PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE DIED DURING THE CASE- AND I STILL REMEMBER HAVING TO TELL ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WORKED ON THE CASE AN INTERN WHO WAS JUST YOU KNOW IN LAW SCHOOL WORKING WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL ON THE DECLARATION. WHEN HE ASKED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS DOING AND HOW IT WAS GOING HAVING TO BREAK THAT NEWS TO HIM. AND THEN FINALLY JUST ANOTHER CASE THAT WAS VERY TYPICAL WHEN I WORKED AT A LOCAL PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES OFTEN PEOPLE HAD TO GO TO HEARING- IF THEY WEREN'T OUTRIGHT DETERMINED TO HAVE A DISABILITY. BY THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AND IN PREPARING HER FOR THE HEARING YOU KNOW I WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH HER WITH A TYPICAL QUESTION SHE MIGHT BE ASKED. AND MAKING SURE THAT SHE WAS READY TO ANSWER THEM. ADD IT BECOMES VERY EVIDENT THAT WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE BASICALLY ASKING SOMEONE TO STAND IN FRONT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND ASKED THAT JUDGE TO RECOGNIZE THEIR HUMANITY. TO BELIEVE THEM THAT THEY REALLY HAVE A HEALTH CONDITION AND THAT THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO AS WE WOULD YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY AT THE TIME BILL BECAUSE THE SYSTEM. AS IF IT IS EVER BILKING A SYSTEM TO TRY TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE SO THAT YOU CAN WORK OR SO THAT YOU CAN BE SELF SUFFICIENT. AND IN THE PROCESS OF THIS QUESTIONING YOU KNOW SHE JUST LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND SHE SAID. GEN YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO HAVE A JOB. EVERY JOB THAT I'VE HAD RECENTLY I HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM BECAUSE I KEEP MISSING WORK BECAUSE I'M SICK. WOULD YOU HIRE ME. AND YOU KNOW JUST RECOGNIZING THAT SOMEBODY NOT ONLY DO THEY RECOGNIZE THE INHUMANITY OF THE SYSTEM BUT THEY KNOW HOW PEOPLE LOOK AT THEM. THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THEM AS LAZY OR IS NOT DESERVING OF CARE. AND YOU KNOW IT JUST IT SPEAKS TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THE ACA AT JUST. HOW IN HUMANE OUR SYSTEM WAS THAT WE WOULD WASTE PEOPLE'S HEALTH WE WOULD WASTE PEOPLE SELF SUFFICIENCY. AND WE WOULD BASICALLY WAY AND TELL PEOPLE DETERIORATED SO MUCH THAT THEY COULD NOT CARE FOR THEMSELVES BEFORE OFFERING ANY SORT OF LENDING HANDS- AND THEN I ALSO. WANT TO REFLECT BACK ON THE ON THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND ON WHAT I THINK A LOT OF THE DOCTORS. YOU KNOW MAY HAVE FELT AS WELL- ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS IMPACTED BY THIS. DEFINITELY OFTEN COME INTO A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION AND I UNDERSTAND THE ANXIETY THAT SO MANY PEOPLE FEEL RIGHT NOW THAT THE ACA AS UNDER THREAT. THERE'S ALSO AN ANXIETY THAT MANY OF US HEALTH ADVOCATES ALSO FEEL BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE WORKING WITH PEOPLE THAT WE COULD NOT HELP. THERE'S A VICARIOUS TRAUMA THAT HAS SUFFERED THERE WHEN YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE. I'M SORRY COME BACK WHEN YOU'RE TOO SICK TO WORK THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO JEFFREY REYNOSO EXECUTIVE ACTOR LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. OKAY YOU DOCTOR PAN AM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M JEFFREY ALSO SECOND DIRECTOR FOR THE LEGISLATION PROBABLY CALIFORNIA I WE REPRESENT THE HEALTH NEEDS OF NEARLY 40% OF OUR STATE'S FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS THE COMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE LATEST C. PH DATA REPORTING LIVE IN LATINOS REPRESENT THE- 60% CASES A NEARLY 50% DEATHS. LATINOS ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN THE CENTRAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING FARMWORKERS DOMESTIC WORKERS RESTAURANT WORKERS IN OTHER OCCUPATIONS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO CONSIDER LIVING OUR LIVE STREAM THIS PANDEMIC IF OUR WORK IS ESSENTIAL ARE WE HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE SENSITIVE. YEAH CAN I MAKE RECESSION IS CITY LINE ASKED ME THE HARDEST ACCORDING TO RECENT POLLING DATA FROM HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH NPR LATINOS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WITH CUTS TO OURS ARE JOB LOSSES THAT'S THE RAINY THAT 36% OF CALIFORNIA LOCULES WHEN EMPLOYER SPONSORED COVERAGE. THE PUBLIC CHARGE REALLY BY THE CURRENT FEDERAL MINISTRATION HAS CAUSED CONFUSION AMONG OUR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES THIS IS XENA PHOBIA AND STOMACH RESELLERS HAS OMITTED A CULTURE OF FEAR OTHER INSTITUTIONS LEAD TO DIS ENROLLMENT AND UNDERGONE MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS DELAYED PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY PREMATURE DEATH OUR COMMUNITY. AC'S MEDICAID EXPANSION AND STATE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES RESULTED IN CALIFORNIA LOCULES EXPERIENCING THE LARGEST DROP OF AN INSURANCE OF EIGHTY RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUPS AT THE START OF THE CA WOMEN'S YUSHIN TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN POINT 9% LATINOS WERE UNINSURED AND BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT NUMBER DROPPED MORE THAN HALF TO TWELVE POINT FOUR PERCENT. THAT I DON'T STATE INVESTMENT IN MARKETING IN OUR REGION INCLUDING ENROLLMENT NAVIGATORS PROGRAM AND CAN YOU HEALTH CENTER AND CBO PARTNERSHIPS WITH CRITICAL INSIGHT ENOUGH OUR COMMUTES INTO COVERAGE ON THE GROUND AND YET AMONG THE REMAINING ENSURING CALIFORNIA LATINOS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE UNINSURED AT 63% ACCORDING TO UCLA TRISTEZA. ONE OF THE. PRIMARY FACTORS DRIVING THIS RATE IS AND HE STATUS I DON'T LEVEL THE C. BLAH YOU KNOW. A COMMUNITY FROM THE LAW IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ELEVEN. BY EXPANDING. BEYOND THE A- BUT FULL MEDICAL COVERAGE LONG KIDS A UNIT. REGARDLESS OF THE- STATUS WE SAW MORE TO DO IN OR TAKES AND POLICE THIS ACCESS DOCUMENTS YEARS AND WORKING ADULTS. WHEN INSTITUTION INSIST REMOTE. TO ACCESSING HEALTHCARE AND DELIVER SERVICES IN MY- AND CULTURE. WE KNOW THAT ARE MOTIVATED AND YOU LICENSE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES HEALTHY. ALANIS COMMITTEE HAVE THE MOST TO GAIN FROM THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND WE ALSO HAVE THE MOST TO LOSE. A SUPREME COURT RULING OVERTURNING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WOULD HAVE DISASTROUS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS FOR STATE. MOVING US BACKWARD ON OUR COLLECTIVE PROGRESS IN TACKLING RACIAL ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR DISH TV HEALTHEQUITY. I WANT THE MEMBERS OFTHE COMMITTEE FOR THIS CONVERSATION- AND TACKLING THE HARD WORK. CREATING A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT IS ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS ALSO HAPPY TO QUESTIONS. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH- DIFFERENT SO. NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO KRISTEN YOUNG- POLICY ADVOCATE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON THAT MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TOTALING COMING CLEAR. MICROPHONES WORK IN. YES SO IT MAY NAME IS PRESS YOUNG FROM THE CAL. J. OF COMMERCETHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ME PER. AND HERE IT'S MUCH I'LL BE SPEAKING TODAY FROM AN EMPLOYER. BASED NOW FROM CAL CHAMBERS POSITION WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE ACA REPEAL ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S NOT A VIABLE REPLACEMENT THE EMPLOYER MANDATE THAT CAME ALONG WITH THE ACA HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN AND AFFECT. OVER FIVE YEARS NOW AND SO TO GET TO THE POINT WHEREEMPLOYERS AND INSURERS WERE ABLE TO OFFER. ACA COMPLIANT PLANS IS A HUGE LEFT IT TOOK. A HUGE FINANCIAL OBLIGATION IT TOOK A HUGE- WORKER POWER OBLIGATION IT TOOK AN ARMY OF LAWYERS YOU CAN IMAGINE. AND WE'RE AT A POINT NOW WHERE ACA COMPLIANT PLANS ARE BEING OFFERED IN THE WORKPLACE SO. THE CONCERN IS IF YOU REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WITHOUT A VIABLE REPLACEMENT. IT'S PUTTING EMPLOYERS AND INSURERS IN A POSITION AGAIN WHERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO RECREATE. A WORKPLACE- A HEALTH PLAN. FRAMEWORK WHICH WOULD PROBABLY MEAN MORE LAWYERS MORE TIME MORE MONEY ANOTHER HUGE HEAVY LIST- NO WOMAN LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL OF AN ACA REPEAL WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE. FROM AN EMPLOYER BASED PERSPECTIVES. I WISH I HAD MORE ANSWERS FOR YOU TODAY AND I WISH I WAS OFFERING MORE INSIGHT IT'S A HUGE QUESTION MARK TO BE SURE- IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO PROJECT. ON THE SMALL. EMPLOYER MARKET. COOLEY OFFER EMPLOYERS HEALTH TO DO THREE SHOP PROGRAM THERE'S A TAX CREDIT THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OBVIOUSLY THE TAX CREDIT WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY THE C. WERE TO BE REPEALED- IN REGARDS TO LARGE EMPLOYERS. THAT LANDSCAPE IS ALSO ONE THAT'S UNPREDICTABLE THIS TIME THE THOUGHT IS YOU WOULD GO BACK TO A PRE ACA. FRAMEWORK IN SO WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN WELL. UNDER THE ACA LARGE EMPLOYERS MEANING FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES THAT WORK FOR A AN ORGANIZATION. THE FULL TIME WORKERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO GET COVERED BY THE EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLAN. NOW FULL TIME WORKERS UP TO FORTY HOURS A WEEK ON THE BBC IT'S THIRTY HOURS A WEEK- FOR HOURS WORKED SO THE IDEA IS IF THERE IS A REPEAL OF THE ACA. EMPLOYERS ARE NOW OFFERING THEIR OWN PLANS AGAIN LIKE THEY DID A- DECADE AGO. THE THOUGHT. IS THE PLANS WOULD LIKELY BE EXTENDED TO FULL TIME WORKERS GOING FORTY HOURS A WEEK AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WORKING THIRTY HOURS A WEEK IN THAT SAME VEIN YOU PROBABLY SEE AN ELIMINATION OF HEALTH PLAN COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES WORK PART TIME OR SEASONAL OR TEMPORARY- AGAIN TO BE UP TO THE ORGANIZATION SO THESE ARE JUST THOUGHTS- ADDITIONALLY A REPEAL THE ACA COULD MEAN THIRTEEN INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT- EMPLOYEES WHO ELECT GROUP HEALTH PLAN COVERAGE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CREASE AC FRAMEWORK ESPECIALLY LARGER EMPLOYERS. THE PREVIOUS- COVERAGE WAS RATHER COMPREHENSIVE AND ROBUST IT WAS THE SMALLER SEGMENT WHERE YOU SAW A LOT OF VARIATION SO IT REALLY IS UP IN THE AIR RIGHT NOW AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLANS AND THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF I BELIEVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT'S HOW THEY- BEGIN THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE- SO THAT'S LOOKING AT THINGS FROM. THE MICRO PERSPECTIVE WITHIN THE WORKPLACE NOW FROM THE MACRO PERSPECTIVE LOOKING AT THE CALIFORNIA JOB SECTOR IN THE JOB SEGMENT ANOTHER HUGE QUESTION MARK WHAT'S IT GONNA DO THIS THERE'S REPEAL WITHOUT FEDERAL DOLLARS ROLLING AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN- SEGMENTS OF THE HEALTHCARE MARKET. THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE YOU'RE LOOKING AT PEOPLE NEEDING TO ALLOCATE POSSIBLY MORE MONEY TO THEIR HEALTHCARE SO MAYBE THEY'RE NOT SPENDING IN OTHER PLACES QUITE AS MUCH THAT COULD AFFECT THE- BASIC ECONOMICS OF THE WORKPLACE- LOT OF UNKNOWNS RIGHT NOW SO I DO APPRECIATE THE TIME I DO APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. ALLOWING US TO BE A PART OF THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PERSON YOUNG FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AND NOW WILL WRAP UP THIS PANEL WITH- ANTHONY WRIGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON- AGAIN MY NAME IS ANTHONY RIGHT OUT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION I WANT TO THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SHARE GIVEN HAN AND- THE COMMITTEE. NOT JUST FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING IT REALLY DIVING INTO THE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC IMPACT OF. THIS DISTURBING COURT CASE. AND EFFORTS RESPECT ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE OVER MANY YEARS. THAT HAS LED TO CALIFORNIA HAVING THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED RATE OF ALL FIFTY STATES. THAT HAS LED TO THE DOCTORS THE ABOMINATION BUT IMPROVEMENTS. OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM- ANDA LOT OF THAT PROGRESS IS IN PERIL WITH THIS- WITH THIS COURT CASE THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN UNDER SO USING THE FOUNDATION AND THE FRAMEWORK. OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF IT IS- CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC AND. AND THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE IN A LOT OF THAT. WEST ON IT DOWN THE AND IF TIME THE WERE TO BE AWAY. AND A LOT OF IT WOULD. POTENTIALLY KALAU. I IT WAS PARTICULARLY BY THE TESTIMONY BY- OUR INDIVIDUAL- PATIENTS TELLING THEIR STORIES. WHO YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT NO BASIC ACCESS TO CARE LIFE AND DEATH ACCESS TO CARE. BUT I THINK ALSO HINTED AT HOW THIS IS. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE FOUR MILLION PLUS PEOPLE THAT CASEY COOPER. IDENTIFIED BETTER DEPENDING ON THE IMPROVEMENTS EXPANSIONS AND MEDIC OUT BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF. OF CALIFORNIANS GETTING SUBSIDIES AND ACCESS TO COVER TO COVER CALIFORNIA. THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY LOSE IT- THAT- THIS IS ABOUT ALL CALIFORNIANS WOULD EITHER- POTENTIALLY HAVE THEIR EMPLOYER BASED. HEALTH IMPACT OR YOU KNOW WHO BECAUSE OF THE CUTS TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT- WOULD YOU. SEE THE PROVIDERS THAT THEY RELY ON- PACKAGE- CUTBACKS STAFFING AND SERVICES. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR- INCOME WAS I THINK MORE BROADLY IT'S VERY BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT. SECURITY ABOUT PEACE OF MIND. BUT WHETHER PEOPLE CAN- MAKE HE LIFE CHOICES WITHOUT HAVING- THAT SORT OF SPECTER OF BEING OF YOU KNOW NOT HAVING. BASIC HEALTH COVERAGE. BE AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THIS- I'M ACTUALLY. AT THE END IN THIS. THE SUPREME COURT CASE. I WOULD SAY. I THINK YOU KNOW THE QUESTION OF YOU KNOW HIGH THAT THAT OF WHAT HAPPEN THE ENTIRE. OR MUCH OF THE EAST WAS DOWN AND- YOU KNOW IT'S A NOT A KIND OF SOMETHING THAT WE EXPERIENCED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS A FEW SPEAKERS INDICATED. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHAT THE WORLD WAS LIKE IT WAS YOU KNOW TERM THE WILD WILD WEST IN FACT I WOULD SAY THE CALIFORNIA. IN BOTH AREAS OF COVERAGE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION AND COST CALIFORNIA JUST JUST DIDN'T HAVE THESE PROBLEMS WE WERE THE POSTER CHILD FOR THESE PROBLEMS YOU KNOW IN COVERAGE WE HAD THE SEVENTH HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE IN THE NATION PRIOR TO THE FORMAL CARE ACT LOS ANGELES. PROBABLY WAS GROUND ZERO. FOR HAVING ON THIS THING SUCH A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED CENTRAL VALLEY RIGHT UP THERE WITH IT- WITH REGARD TO CONSUMER PROTECTION PEOPLE WERE DENIED FOR PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS NOT EVEN AFFORD A- DENIED FROM GETTING INTO COVERAGE. BUT IN SOME CASES THEY'RE COVERED WAS RESCINDED AFTER THE FACT WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT THEY HAD A PRE EXISTING CONDITION- ARE THESE BOTH THE THINGS GENERATED NATIONAL HEADLINES AND HELP PROMPTED THE POINT OF REFORM. AND THE SAME WITH OUR PREMIUM INCREASES ONE PARTICULAR PREMIUM INCREASE. OF PROPOSING. CREDITED AS ONE OF THE LAST THAT WE- ACTUALLY LED TO THE- OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SO WE. WE HAVE. THAT EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE HAVING. BEEN IN MY AT ACCESS. OR NEARLY TO DEATH NOW. I WOULD SAY. I WILL ALSO SAY IN THAT EXPERIENCE THAT YOU KNOW WE WORK TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES. POINT BY POINT- OVER- OVER THE YEARS PRIOR TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IT WAS REALLY HARD WITHOUT THE FRAMEWORK IN THE FINANCING. OF THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE ACA- IT'S NOT LIKE WE DIDN'T TRY TO- PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE EXISTING CONDITIONS BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO DO THAT WITHOUT THAT. MONEY AND LEX IT WOULD HAVE HAD FINANCING WITHOUT THE FRAMEWORK. AND YOU KNOW SOME OF IT IT'S ABOUT THIS FEDERAL PREEMPTION THERE IS YOU KNOW ABOUT. YOU KNOW FIVE SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS OR IN FEDERALLY REGULATED PLANS THAT WE CAN'T TOUCH AT THE STATE LEVEL EVEN IF WE PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL. IN OTHER WORDS- BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE FINANCING- THE L. A. MENTIONED- YOU KNOW OVER TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE MEDICAID EXPANSION AND THE SUBSIDIES AND COVERAGE CALIFORNIA ALONE. BUT THE LEGISLATORS WHO RUN THIS COMMITTEE. EQUIVALENT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT MONEY IN THE STATE BUDGET. YOU WOULD HAPPEN- ON UNDO ALL OF THE FUNDING. FOR ALL OF HIGHER EDUCATION UCCS USE. DURING THE HOLIDAYS AND ALL OF CORRECTIONS COMBINE. IN ORDER TO MAKE UP THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT IT. WAS THAT WE GET THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BETTER HEALTH SYSTEM GETS- THROUGH THE ACA. SO YOU KNOW WE- CAN WE GO GO IT ALONE IF WE IF WE LOSE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IT WOULD BE MORE OF A SALVAGE OPERATION IT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE LIFEBOATS- OF FOR A HANDFUL OF. FOLKS THAT PETER LEE TALKED ABOUT RATHER THAN. KEEPING WHICH IS TO AVOID THE ICEBERG HEATING IS HOW CAN WE.PREVENT THAT THE- IT'S THE- CATASTROPHIC. OF THE OUR YOU KNOW OF AS THIS. YOU KNOW EITHER THE COURTS AND YOU KNOW GUYS. TO ATTORNEY MR LEAD THAT NASH GUARD. OR IS HE OUR FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES. TO FIND ALTERNATIVES- YOU KNOW THROUGH THE CONGRESS AND OTHERWISE AND THAT'S WHAT I FINALLY WANT TO SAY IS THAT. YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAID WHY- AGAIN THIS IS SO IMPORTANT YOU KNOW AND SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL MAYBE IT WON'T HAPPEN MAYBE THIS WILL HAPPEN AT THE- OAK. MAYBE THERE WILL BE A MUCH MORE NARROW RULING OR NOT A ROOF. WILLING AT ALL TIMES REPORT BUT EVEN A NON ZERO CHANCE OF THE CATASTROPHE THAT IS BEING DESCRIBED HERE. IS WORTH SHOUTING FROM THE ROOFTOPS AND THE FACT THAT NONZERO CHANCE DOES YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY IS GOING TO GET. A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKELY IN THE NEXT. FEW WEEKS- IS IT SOMETHING THAT AND WE SHOULD BE OUR- HAVE OUR- HAVE OUR BORROWED FIVE ALARM FIRES OUT READY. BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT AMOUNT THAT CHANCE DOES BECOME ZERO IN IT. THE GOOD WORK OF. OF THE ADVOCACY OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE BUTTONED UP OR END UP. ON THE LIFT THE LEGISLATORS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS TESTIMONY JUST- UNDERLINING THE REAL IMPACTS YOUR IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH YOU KNOW IN THE MOST UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HAS THE MOST TO LOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT US. QUESTIONS ARE CALM FROM COMMITTEE. THIS SO LEYVA. DID YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP THERE. YOU THINK YOU VERY MUCH PAN. I JUST HAVE TO SAY HERE TO WHOLE. AND IN SO PROUD OF EVERYONE BEEN A- OF THE AFFORDABLE. ACT AND EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN A PART OF IMPLEMENTING IT. AND IT'S I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON HOW SHOCKING IT IS STILL IS TO ME. THAT WE HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO HAVE TAXPAYER FUNDED HEALTH CARE BUT ARE TRYING TO DE FUND HEALTH CARE. FOR THE SICKEST PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY BUT NOT JUST THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING DESERVES ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE CONSUMERS. WHO SHARE THEIR VERY PERSONAL STORIES- WHEN I WAS WITH THE UFCW AND WE WERE NEGOTIATING BENEFITS FOR OUR MEMBERS. WE'VE HEARD THE STORIES FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK IN GROCERY STORES. EVERYONE NEEDS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE ROUTINELY GET CHECKUPS. THEY DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE WHEN IT'S SUPER SERIOUS AND COST THE WHOLE SYSTEM MORE. SO I JUST- I THINK SENATOR MONNING SAID IT BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE CONSUMERS. TO WRITE YOUR STORY SENATE TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REALLY IT TO CONGRESS AND THE SENATE TO THE SUPREME COURT- AND JUST DON'T BELIEVE ALL THAT RHETORIC THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM. REPUBLICANS WHO MANY OF THEM HAVE- TAXPAYER FUNDED HEALTH CARE AS WELL AND I JUST ALSO WANT TO IN BY SAYING WHEN WE WERE SIGNING PEOPLE UP ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ON COVER CALIFORNIA. TEN YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS FIRST ENACTED THE PEOPLE CAME THROUGH THE DOORS OF MY LOCAL UNION. HADN'T HAD HEALTH CARE IN TWENTY YEARS OR LONGER OR FOR THEIR WHOLE LIFE YOU CAN TELL. YOU CAN TELL WHEN PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD ACCESS HEALTH CARE AND I AM HAPPY BE IN OF THE- WHERE I CAN TRY AND HELP. AND WE JUST WHO YOU ELECT MATTERS- NO ONE SHOULD BE DENYING PEOPLE HEALTH CARE I'M SO PROUD OF THE WORK THAT EVERYONE WHO'S TALKED HERE TODAY HAS DONE- FOR. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FOR COVER CALIFORNIA PETERLEE IF YOU'RE STILL ON A GREAT JOB YOU'RE DOING WONDERFUL WORK. AND THE MONEY THAT CALIFORNIA RECEIVES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THIS IS A HUGE SO. THAT HELPS THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO NEEDS HEALTH CARE SO. DR PAN THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED- I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS ACCESS. TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA. I THINK THAT WAS A PRIME MORE COMMENT THAN A QUESTION SO I'M GONNA MOVE ON THEN TO CENTER RUBIO. WELL DOCTOR CAN I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF COMMENTS RATHER THAN QUESTIONS BUT YOU KNOW I'LL JUST FOLLOW ON THE FOOTSTEPS OF SENATOR LEYVA I REALLY JUST ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AND- THANK THE WORK THEY EVERYONE STAND IN THIS. IN THIS REGARD BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT'S SO MUCH HARDER TO HAVE SOMETHING IN FOR SOMETHING TO BE DISMANTLED AND I KNOW WHEN I THINK OF. SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE FOR DESTROYING IT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A SYSTEM. THAT'S JUST GONNA CRUMBLE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE TIED TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FROM. SERVICE PROVIDERS TO JOBS TO THE SURROUNDING ECONOMY. AND IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO BE HEALTHY WE NEED TO STATE. THAT WITH WHAT WE HAVE AND SO HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO ADVOCATING NOW SENATOR LEYVA SAID WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE REACHING OUT TO THE TO THE- OF CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS AND NOT THE SENATE AND PUTTING THEIR STORIES OUT THERE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HURT. IN PARTICULAR THE INNER CITY COMMUNITIES LATINOS- JUST IN GENERAL THE LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND SO I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THAT'S SPOKEN HERE TODAY THE PERSONAL STORIES AND- AND EVERYONE WHO'S STILL WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT. STAYS WHERE IT'S AT AND TO YOU FOUNDER. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER I THINK THIS IS A TIMELY CONVERSATION BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I HAVE ANXIETY OVER THIS AND I AND I'M GONNA BE OKAY BUT I HAVE ANXIETY OVER THE PEOPLE THAT ARE. ARE YOU KNOW COULD STAND TO LOSE WHAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR COVERAGE AND DO YOU KNOW I COMING FROM. HOUSEHOLD THAT DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE AS A CHILD I KNOW HOW SCARY IT CAN BE SELF. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AND I JUST I THINK THE DOCTOR PAN BEFORE THIS IS OVER FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER TODAY. THANK YOU AND ACTUALLY- WE DO ACCEPT BOTH COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WHEN I MADE MY REMARK WAS JUST MORE DIFFUSED. SO THAT THAT I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE NEED TO. ANSWER QUESTION OR RESPOND FOR WHAT THE- SELF. ASSEMBLY COMMENTS PROOF I TO. ONE TO. SETTLES IN THE HANDS UP I TWO ONE TWO. ALSO MAKES MY OWN COMMENTS- THE FIRST ONE I DO WANT TO THANK ALL THE ADVOCATES WHO WHO'S WHO'S SPOKEN AND- SHARED YOUR EXPERIENCES. YEAH WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE ACA FOR TEN YEARS WE TALKED ABOUT SUCCESSES- IT'S NOT PERFECT AND DEAL WE'VE DONE WORK ON IT WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO WORK- ACTUALLY FRANKLY ONE OF THE THINGS I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT'S BEEN SO POLITICIZED. THAT IN CONGRESS- INSTEAD OF WORKING TO IMPROVE THE THINGS THAT COULD BE IMPROVED- IF YOU TRY TO PROVE IT YOUR THEN FOR IT AND THEREFORE PEOPLE WOULDN'T VOTE FOR IMPROVEMENTS. RIGHT AND INSTEAD WE KEEP HAVING THIS CYCLE ABOUT DO WE REPEAL THE ACA ARE NOT INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT LOOK THIS IS THE LAW OF THE LAND WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. I DO ALSO WANT TO THANK ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA AND HIS TEAM FOR CARRYING ON THIS FIGHT. TO THE SUPREME COURT- I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT- WELL CERTAINLY I THINK WHEN THE AC IS BEING PASSED AND- PEOPLE LOOKED AT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND THE PENALTY. THAT THE PROBABLY WERE IN A POLICY ANALYST YOU'LL POLICY PEOPLE AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THAT'S TIED TO OTHER PORTIONS PARTICULARLY THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO PRE EXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS AND AS THE- DIFFICULTY MENTION DOUBTS NOT JUST ONE. THING IT'S ACTUALLY A WHOLE SET OF THINGS IN IN THE LAW THAT DOES THAT BUT I THINK ALSO SINCE WE'VE EXPERIENCE- IN THE NATION AFTER CONGRESS ESSENTIALLY ZEROED OUT THE PENALTY THE FACT THAT THE AC ITSELF STILL CONTINUES TO FUNCTION. AND ACTUALLY FUNCTIONED RELATIVELY WELL. THAT YOU KNOW. COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE MADE A HOW. ESSENTIAL THAT IT IS IN TERMS OF LINKING IT TO ALL THE OTHER PROVISIONS HOPEFULLY- THE SUPREME COURT. WELL FIRST WHILE THE SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZES THAT STATE THAT THIS IS A THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND IT SAYS SHOULD NOT BE OVERTURNED BUT- EVEN IN TERMS OF SEVERABILITY- THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT CERTAINLY. THE EIGHTIES BEEN OLD FUNCTION IN THIS COUNTRY- EVEN WITH A ZEROED OUT INDIVIDUAL MANDATE- AS- BUT CONGRESS BUT- THE OTHER THING I ALSO WANT TO JUST MAKE AN OBSERVATION AND- CERTAINLY HEARD FROM OUR CONSUMERS AND TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM GEORGIA. TERRY OF INSURANCE AND CHEN FLORI AND- AND ALSO FOR- FROM OTHERS AS WELL AS- ACTUALLY WHAT KIND OF WHAT THE ACA DOES. IN TERMS OF GIVING AMERICANS FREEDOM. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES PEOPLE THINK FREEDOM IS SOMETHING THAT ONLY PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN IDEOLOGY TALK ABOUT THAT THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT FREEDOM. RIGHT TO FREEDOM FROM FEAR TO FREEDOM OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DIFFERENT KIND OF CAREER CHOICES WE HEARD ABOUT THAT FROM CONSUMERS. AND THAT WILL THE SUPREME COURT TAKE THIS FREEDOM AWAY FROM AMERICANS. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION THAT'S COMING BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND THANKS TO OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL MANY OTHERS. THE CONGRESS PASSED THE LAW THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE LAW. THAT IS GIVEN NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO AMERICANS. BY PROVIDING THEM HEALTHCARE. AND SO IS THE FREEDOM TO BE TAKEN AWAY. AND I THINK IN THIS HEARING WE HEARD WHAT IT WAS LIKE TEN YEARS AGO WE CAN FORGET A LOT OF THINGS. OVER A DECADE. BUT WE HEARD ABOUT WAS LIKE FOR. AND WHAT'S BEEN SENSE IT'S NOT PERFECT WE NEED TO DO MORE. WE'RE NOW THE PEERS CODED A THINK THAT SERVE PERHAPS UNDERSCORES FOR PEOPLE. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS MAYBE IT'S A REMINDER BUT WE HAVE THE PROTECTIONS OF THE ACA RIGHT NOW AS WERE STRUGGLING TO COPE IT. IMAGINE THEY'RE TAKEN AWAY. WHAT THAT MEANS. SO I THINK ARE WITH THAT- I JUST I GUESS THAT'S AGAIN MY COMMENT- FOR NOW- BUT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL THE WITNESSES- WHO HAVE A TESTIFYING PARTICULARLY. THE WITNESSES WE JUST HEARD FROM. AND IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS PERFORM WITH PUBLIC COMMENT. CASEY NO HANDS UP. ALL RIGHT.
