00:34:56.161 --> 00:35:01.132 region:rollup2
NEED WAS NOT WELL SERVED IN THE

EMERGENCY ROOM. MY SISTER WAS ON

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:03.868 region:rollup2

THE KIND OF CARE THEY NEED.

00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:24.022 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:26.624 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T JUST NEED CARE.

00:35:24.022 --> 00:35:29.194 region:rollup2

THERE ARE CASES WHEN EMERGENCY

00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:48.446 region:rollup2

00:53:37.481 --> 00:53:40.250 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND A LOT OF BOTH

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:43.320 region:rollup2
SIDES.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:45.089 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT I SEE YOU

00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:48.726 region:rollup2
BILL LIKE THIS ARE THE FACT THAT

THE EMERGENCY ROOMS IN THE SOME

00:53:48.726 --> 00:53:51.495 region:rollup2
OF THE FOLKS I'VE SPOKEN TO.

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:53.197 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT STAFF TWENTY FOUR

00:53:51.495 --> 00:53:56.133 region:rollup2
SEVEN WHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH

PROVIDER OR YOU KNOW OTHER TYPES

00:53:56.133 --> 00:53:59.169 region:rollup2
OF.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.137 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL SO THAT'S AN ISSUE

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:02.272 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE WAITING IN THE

00:54:00.137 --> 00:54:03.941 region:rollup2
ALREADY CROWDED EMERGENCY ROOMS

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:06.009 region:rollup2
THEY IMPACT ON CROWDED YOURS.

00:54:03.941 --> 00:54:08.078 region:rollup2
.

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:09.313 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN IS AN EMT MAKING

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:11.148 region:rollup2
THE DIAGNOSTIC OR TREATMENT

00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:11.615 region:rollup2
DECISION THAT'S THAT WAS A

00:54:11.148 --> 00:54:12.983 region:rollup2
CONCERN OF MINE IN THE

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:14.952 region:rollup2
BEGINNING.

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:17.054 region:rollup2
ON A COMPLICATED PIG CASE OR A

00:54:14.952 --> 00:54:18.522 region:rollup2
PATIENT WHO. THEY'RE NOT

00:54:17.054 --> 00:54:20.157 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH THEM.

00:54:18.522 --> 00:54:23.961 region:rollup2
I SEE THIS I WAS WONDERING WHERE

00:54:20.157 --> 00:54:26.897 region:rollup2
THIS CAME FROM IS THAT FROM.

00:54:23.961 --> 00:54:28.665 region:rollup2
OKAY. BECAUSE IT DOES DELINEATE

00:54:26.897 --> 00:54:30.534 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WITH SOME OF THE.

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:31.869 region:rollup2
THE THE FRAMEWORK OF HOW THE

00:54:30.534 --> 00:54:34.371 region:rollup2
DECISION IS MADE WHERE THE

00:54:31.869 --> 00:54:36.406 region:rollup2
PATIENT WOULD GO. ON.

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:38.242 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOUND IS YOU HAVE THE

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:40.177 region:rollup2
SAME PEOPLE OVER AND OVER WAS A

00:54:38.242 --> 00:54:41.745 region:rollup2
GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE IN THE?

ON REGULAR BASIS.

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:49.686 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL

00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:51.221 region:rollup2
WE HAD A SOBRIETY CENTER.

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:52.990 region:rollup2
WHERE OF THE POLICE ACTUALLY

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:55.159 region:rollup2
WERE TRANSPORTING PEOPLE WHICH

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:56.460 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN RETROSPECT NOW WHEN

00:54:55.159 --> 00:54:59.129 region:rollup2

WAS MUCH MORE RISKY?

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:02.499 region:rollup2
THING THERE'S A LOT MORE

PROTECTIONS OUR OBSCENE.

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:06.203 region:rollup2
FOR THAT BUT ONE OF THE

00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:09.606 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF HAVING THE SOBRIETY

00:55:06.203 --> 00:55:11.675 region:rollup2
CENTER OR IN YOUR CASE HAVING.

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:13.510 region:rollup2
THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTER IS

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:14.845 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY THEN TO OR HAVE CASE

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:16.547 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AROUND THE PEOPLE

00:55:14.845 --> 00:55:19.683 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY COME IN.

00:55:16.547 --> 00:55:20.717 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW BEFORE IT WAS JUST.

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:23.187 region:rollup2
IN THE BEGINNING IT'S NEW KIND

00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:24.388 region:rollup2
OF EVOLVE FROM A BED TO.

00:55:23.187 --> 00:55:25.989 region:rollup2
SLEEP IN AND GET OVER YOUR YOU

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:29.827 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL. CONSUMPTION AND THEN IN

00:55:28.959 --> 00:55:31.328 region:rollup2
THE MORNING THEY WERE DEALT WITH

00:55:29.827 --> 00:55:34.131 region:rollup2
CERTAIN RATHER THAN TRANSPORTING

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:36.066 region:rollup2
SOME TO JAIL. TO NOW THE ABILITY

00:55:34.131 --> 00:55:37.801 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY OPEN CASE MANAGEMENT

ON EVERYONE THAT COMES IN SO

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:42.773 region:rollup2
THEN THERE FOLLOWED UP FROM THEN

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:45.309 region:rollup2
ON. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO AVOID

00:55:42.773 --> 00:55:46.677 region:rollup2
THIS REPETITION OF BEING TAKEN

SO THAT WAS.

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:55.786 region:rollup2

NO ONE.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:28.131 region:rollup2
I'M AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.999 region:rollup2

CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.306 region:rollup2
I HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:38.041 region:rollup2
CMB BECAUSE I TREAT CHILDREN

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:40.944 region:rollup2
WITH HEARING LOSS AND SEE A

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:43.413 region:rollup2
MOVIE. IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:44.614 region:rollup2
AND CAN GENERAL HEARING LOSS.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:45.882 region:rollup2
YET IT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:48.184 region:rollup2
AWARENESS

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:51.020 region:rollup2
AMONGST NOT ONLY MY PATIENTS BUT

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:52.989 region:rollup2
ALSO MY COLLEAGUES.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:55.558 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHO

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:57.360 region:rollup2
HAS CMV AS AN INFANT AND WE MISS

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:59.229 region:rollup2
THIS VALUABLE WINDOW OF

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:01.531 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR DIAGNOSIS.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:03.233 region:rollup2
AS THE PEDIATRIC OTOLOGY LIST A

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:05.101 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WHO TREATS CHILDREN WITH

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:07.137 region:rollup2
HEARING LOSS AND DEAFNESS.

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:09.038 region:rollup2
IT CONTINUOUSLY SHOCKS AND

01:05:07.137 --> 01:05:10.840 region:rollup2
SADDENS ME THAT WE ARE NOT

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:12.876 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSING THIS CONDITION. THAT

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:15.011 region:rollup2
CAUSES SUCH SEVERE SYMPTOMS SUCH

01:05:12.876 --> 01:05:15.945 region:rollup2
AS PROFOUND DEAFNESS.

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:18.114 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT BRINGING THE

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:19.416 region:rollup2
NECESSARY ATTENTION TO CMB AND

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:21.618 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE AWARENESS.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:23.052 region:rollup2
CMB.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:24.654 region:rollup2
NOW THE REASON THIS IS HAPPENING

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:26.790 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THIS VIRUS

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:29.325 region:rollup2
SHEDS EARLY IN THE IN THE EARLY

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:30.427 region:rollup2
MONTHS OF LIFE DURING INFANCY.

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:32.162 region:rollup2
AND IT CANNOT BE DETECTED LATER

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:33.696 region:rollup2
ON.

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:35.031 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS THAT A CHILD WHO

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:36.833 region:rollup2
PRESENTS TO MY CLINIC WITH

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:38.601 region:rollup2
HEARING LOSS AT THE AGE OF SIX

01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:39.502 region:rollup2
WHO IS PROFOUNDLY DEAF. THEY

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:41.237 region:rollup2
WILL NEVER KNOW IF IT WAS FROM

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:42.539 region:rollup2
CMB.

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:44.040 region:rollup2
WE END UP WORKING UP THEIR

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:44.941 region:rollup2
HEARING LOSS WITH GENETIC

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.443 region:rollup2
TESTING MULTIPLE TO GENETIC

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:48.945 region:rollup2
TESTS

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:50.647 region:rollup2
CT SCANS AND MRIS.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.615 region:rollup2
ALL WHICH COME BACK NORMAL

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:53.650 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE WOULD THAT WE DO NOT

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:56.586 region:rollup2
KNOW WHY THIS CHILD HAS PROFOUND

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:58.288 region:rollup2
DEAFNESS.

01:05:56.586 --> 01:06:00.990 region:rollup2
THESE CHILDREN WOULD NOT NEED

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:03.660 region:rollup2
THIS UNNECESSARY RADIATION. AND

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:05.395 region:rollup2
CONTRAST UNNECESSARY TESTING.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.863 region:rollup2
IF THEIR CONDITION HAD BEEN

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:08.998 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSED IN THE THAT TIME

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:09.999 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FASHION.

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:11.734 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE PROBLEM IN

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:13.036 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING THE INFECTION NOT

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:13.570 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:15.538 region:rollup2
TO TEST FOR WE DO HAVE THE

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.973 region:rollup2
TESTS.

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:19.909 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE WE ARE MISSING KEY

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:21.010 region:rollup2
STEPS IN THE TIMELY DIAGNOSIS.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:22.278 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION PROPOSED BUY

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:24.481 region:rollup2

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:26.349 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP AT OUR STATE AND

AND CONFRONT THE ISSUE OF CMP.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.854 region:rollup2
IT'S THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:32.322 region:rollup2
HAIR LOSS IN CHILDREN IT COSTS

01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:33.790 region:rollup2
ARE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FUNDS BUT

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:35.525 region:rollup2
IT ALSO COSTS SIGNIFICANT

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:37.060 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL. EMOTIONAL AND

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:38.761 region:rollup2
COGNITIVE IMPACT IN THE FUTURE

SO IT'S BEEN BEEN A FEW YEARS

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:25.647 region:rollup2
SINCE WE WORK TOGETHER.

01:36:24.846 --> 01:36:26.514 region:rollup2
BUT I REMEMBER LET ARE

01:36:25.647 --> 01:36:27.482 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU AND I

01:36:43.865 --> 01:36:46.434 region:rollup2
IT IS HARD TO PREDICT.

01:36:44.866 --> 01:36:48.736 region:rollup2
I WOULD ASSUME THAT WOULD BE

01:36:46.434 --> 01:36:50.872 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE DAY CAPS THAT WE

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:52.407 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY INSPECTORS A FEW YMCA

01:36:50.872 --> 01:36:54.976 region:rollup2

FORWARD AND ASK FOR INSPECTIONS.

01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:58.646 region:rollup2
SO WILL BE STRUCTURED BASED ON

01:36:56.778 --> 01:37:00.081 region:rollup2
THOSE AND THAT FEE WOULD BE

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:01.816 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE TIME TO ACTUALLY DO

01:37:00.081 --> 01:37:02.684 region:rollup2
THAT INSPECTION.

01:37:01.816 --> 01:37:03.918 region:rollup2
SO.

01:37:02.684 --> 01:37:05.186 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO PREDICT WHAT THAT

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:05.820 region:rollup2
DOLLAR AMOUNT WILL BE AT THIS

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:11.059 region:rollup2
POINT BUT WILL DEFINITELY STUDY

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:15.630 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:37:11.059 --> 01:37:17.899 region:rollup2

EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS WILL

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:26.474 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO THAT TEST SHOULD

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.542 region:rollup2
THIS MOVE FORWARD.

01:37:26.474 --> 01:37:28.476 region:rollup2
WE'VE WORKED OUT A LOT OF THE

01:37:27.542 --> 01:37:30.144 region:rollup2
ISSUES I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO

01:37:28.476 --> 01:37:31.412 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO SO BUT I DO THINK

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:33.147 region:rollup2
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT FELL.

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:35.049 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE WHO FOR PARENTS TO DO

01:37:33.147 --> 01:37:36.451 region:rollup2
SEND THEIR KIDS TO CAMP THEY MAY

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:37.685 region:rollup2
NOT FIT IN ALMOST SURELY DON'T

01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:38.986 region:rollup2

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:40.321 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF THESE CAMPS ARE.

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:41.556 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THEY DO KNOW IS THEY

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:42.857 region:rollup2
WANT THEIR KIDS TO BE SAFE WHILE

01:37:41.556 --> 01:37:43.925 region:rollup2
THEY GO THERE AND THIS IS WHAT'S

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:44.926 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR IMPORTANT THING BUT

01:37:43.925 --> 01:37:46.461 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE ENTRY INDUSTRY

01:37:44.926 --> 01:37:47.195 region:rollup2
ITSELF IS ASKING TO BE REGULATED

01:37:46.461 --> 01:37:49.130 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE.

01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:52.667 region:rollup2
FOR FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.

01:37:50.665 --> 01:37:54.202 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE ENTRUST OUR KIDS TO

01:37:52.667 --> 01:37:56.738 region:rollup2
THESE CAMPS I THINK WE ALL OF US

01:37:54.202 --> 01:37:58.005 region:rollup2
AS PARENTS WANT TO BELIEVE THAT

01:37:56.738 --> 01:37:59.607 region:rollup2

REGARDLESS OF THE EXACT TIME

FRAME WE CAN ALL AGREE IT IS

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:51.319 region:rollup2
TAKING FAR TOO LONG THE BACKLOG

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:52.320 region:rollup2
IT'S REACHED THE POINT OF

APPROVING THESE APPLICATIONS

CATHETERIZATION BAD. THAT'S

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:16.811 region:rollup2
DELAYING THE TREATMENT OF THOSE

AMBULANCE TO A DISTANT FACILITY.

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:29.590 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BECAUSE DPH HAD NOT

ONE OF THE BARRIERS TO ACCESSING

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:34.901 region:rollup2

.

02:06:36.622 --> 02:06:39.759 region:rollup2
THE PORTION OF OUR HEALTHCARE

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:41.427 region:rollup2
DOLLAR GOING TO PRIMARY CARE IS

02:06:39.759 --> 02:06:42.495 region:rollup2
NOT WELL KNOWN AND IT SHOULD BE.

02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:43.663 region:rollup2
WE NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

02:06:42.495 --> 02:06:44.964 region:rollup2
OF PRIMARY CARE INVESTMENT IN

02:06:43.663 --> 02:06:46.399 region:rollup2
OUR STATE.

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:47.867 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT A WELL FUNCTIONING

02:06:46.399 --> 02:06:49.535 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WITH THE

02:06:47.867 --> 02:06:51.170 region:rollup2
ROBUST PRIMARY CARE FOUNDATION

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:52.205 region:rollup2
DELIVERS A HIGHER QUALITY.

02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:53.573 region:rollup2
HIGHER QUALITY CARE AT A LOWER

02:06:52.205 --> 02:06:55.541 region:rollup2
COST AND WE KNOW THAT THAT

02:06:53.573 --> 02:06:57.076 region:rollup2
PRIMERICA OUR FOUNDATION WITH

02:06:55.541 --> 02:06:58.744 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE RESOURCES. ALLOWS FOR

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:59.312 region:rollup2
THE DELIVERY OF RIGHT CARE IN

02:06:58.744 --> 02:07:00.913 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT

02:06:59.312 --> 02:07:02.014 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:07:00.913 --> 02:07:03.082 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE SHARE OF

02:07:02.014 --> 02:07:05.151 region:rollup2
SPENDING ON PRIMARY CARE IS A

02:07:03.082 --> 02:07:07.453 region:rollup2
CRITICAL MEASURE OF HOW STRONG

02:07:05.151 --> 02:07:08.654 region:rollup2
THAT PRIMARY CARE FOUNDATION IS.

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:09.755 region:rollup2
BUT IN VIRTUALLY US HEALTHCARE

02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:11.357 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE GOING IN THE

02:07:09.755 --> 02:07:12.959 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

02:07:11.357 --> 02:07:14.727 region:rollup2
NATIONAL UTILIZATION OF PRIMARY

02:07:12.959 --> 02:07:16.262 region:rollup2
CARE. IS DECREASING AND

02:07:14.727 --> 02:07:18.197 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION ESPECIALLY SERVICES

02:07:16.262 --> 02:07:20.199 region:rollup2
CLIMBING AT AN ALARMING RATE.

02:07:18.197 --> 02:07:22.135 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A SMART WAY

02:07:20.199 --> 02:07:23.436 region:rollup2
TO RUN A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BUT

02:07:22.135 --> 02:07:25.238 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T CHANGE WHAT WE.

02:07:23.436 --> 02:07:27.273 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DON'T MEASURE?

02:07:25.238 --> 02:07:28.741 region:rollup2
SO AB TWENTY NINETY FIVE ALLOWS

02:07:27.273 --> 02:07:30.309 region:rollup2
FOR THE GATHERING OF A DATE AND

02:07:28.741 --> 02:07:31.844 region:rollup2
IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY FOLLOWING

02:07:30.309 --> 02:07:33.446 region:rollup2
IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OREGON IN

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:35.148 region:rollup2
RHODE ISLAND THAT'S SHOWING US

02:07:33.446 --> 02:07:36.249 region:rollup2
HOW TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE.

02:07:35.148 --> 02:07:37.950 region:rollup2
OF THOSE STATES HAVE FOUND THAT

02:07:36.249 --> 02:07:39.285 region:rollup2
JUST HAVING THE DATA AVAILABLE

02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:41.721 region:rollup2
IS CHANGING HOW HEALTH PLANS

02:07:39.285 --> 02:07:42.021 region:rollup2
INSURANCE APPROACH THE PROBLEM.

02:07:41.721 --> 02:07:43.990 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:44.624 region:rollup2
TACKLE THE TECHNICAL ISSUE OF

02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:46.359 region:rollup2
COLLECTING THE DATA IN VARIOUS

02:07:44.624 --> 02:07:47.994 region:rollup2
WAYS EITHER THROUGH HAVING A

02:07:46.359 --> 02:07:49.395 region:rollup2
REGULATOR OR STATE DEPARTMENT

02:07:47.994 --> 02:07:50.930 region:rollup2
COLLECT THE DATA AND ANALYZE IT

02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:52.832 region:rollup2
OR USING AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS

02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:54.233 region:rollup2
DATABASE. WE EXPECT THAT THE

02:07:52.832 --> 02:07:56.335 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE THAT SET UP IN

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:56.869 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL GUIDE US TO A

02:07:56.335 --> 02:07:58.671 region:rollup2
FORMAT THAT WORKS BEST FOR

02:07:56.869 --> 02:07:59.939 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:07:58.671 --> 02:08:01.274 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE GREAT WORK TOGETHER

02:07:59.939 --> 02:08:03.075 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA ON IMPROVING

02:08:01.274 --> 02:08:04.410 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND COVERAGE.

02:08:03.075 --> 02:08:05.912 region:rollup2
BUT NOW WE HAVE TO BEGIN THE

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:06.979 region:rollup2
WORK OF RESHAPING HOW WE.

02:08:05.912 --> 02:08:09.715 region:rollup2
DELIVER THE CARE TO CREATE A

02:08:06.979 --> 02:08:11.050 region:rollup2
MORE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM.

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:11.984 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE MORE

02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:13.352 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE WITH BETTER

02:08:11.984 --> 02:08:15.454 region:rollup2

MEASURING AND SUSTAINING SYSTEM

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:18.724 region:rollup2
WIDE INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE.

02:08:17.123 --> 02:08:19.525 region:rollup2
WE WILL NOT SEE FUNDAMENTAL

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:21.194 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR HEALTHCARE

02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:23.062 region:rollup2

02:08:21.194 --> 02:08:24.597 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE ORIENTED AND WE CAN

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:26.065 region:rollup2

THE POPULATION THAT THE HEALTH

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:29.689 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN A. BIGGER

02:10:28.254 --> 02:10:31.457 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM WITH THIS

02:10:29.689 --> 02:10:32.925 region:rollup2
BILL IS HE ISSUE OF HOW WE WILL

CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE MARKET

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:39.865 region:rollup2
IS LARGELY BASED ON A CAPITATED

02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:41.434 region:rollup2
BASIS NOT FEE FOR SERVICE. SO

02:10:39.865 --> 02:10:43.102 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS THAT PLANS GENERALLY

02:10:41.434 --> 02:10:45.137 region:rollup2
DO NOT PAY ON A CLAIMS BY CLAIMS

02:10:43.102 --> 02:10:46.972 region:rollup2
BASIS ON THE PAPER PROVIDER

02:10:45.137 --> 02:10:48.908 region:rollup2

AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE SO

02:10:55.848 --> 02:10:59.351 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE INFORMATION ON

02:10:56.882 --> 02:11:00.686 region:rollup2
DIRECT HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:01.921 region:rollup2
ON EXISTS AT THAT LEVEL.

02:11:00.686 --> 02:11:03.189 region:rollup2
THIS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE

02:11:01.921 --> 02:11:04.123 region:rollup2
BILL THE HEALTH PLANS MUST

02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:05.891 region:rollup2
SURVEY THEIR PROVIDER GROUPS FOR

02:11:04.123 --> 02:11:06.792 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION.

02:11:05.891 --> 02:11:08.260 region:rollup2
AND THE RATE OF RESPONSE BY

02:11:06.792 --> 02:11:09.128 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:11.063 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH CLAIM CAN PERFORM

02:11:09.128 --> 02:11:13.699 region:rollup2
ACCURATE COMPLETE SURVEY OF

02:11:11.063 --> 02:11:15.534 region:rollup2
SERVICES PERFORMED IN PAID.

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:17.203 region:rollup2
HEALTH ONE DATA REQUESTS ARE NOT

02:11:15.534 --> 02:11:18.637 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY POPULAR AMONG A

02:11:17.203 --> 02:11:20.806 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED PROVIDERS.

02:11:18.637 --> 02:11:22.341 region:rollup2
THE DOCTORS GENERALLY DO NOT

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:24.643 region:rollup2
WANT THE HMO IN THEIR OFFICE.

02:11:22.341 --> 02:11:26.078 region:rollup2
AS SUCH PROVIDER RESPONSIVENESS

02:11:24.643 --> 02:11:26.812 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A PROBLEM THAT OUR

02:11:26.078 --> 02:11:28.514 region:rollup2
PLANS OF EXPERIENCE BUYER

02:11:26.812 --> 02:11:30.049 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO

02:11:28.514 --> 02:11:31.183 region:rollup2
COMPLY WITH REPORTING MANDATES.

02:11:30.049 --> 02:11:32.918 region:rollup2
WEATHER IS COMPLYING WITH THE

02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:34.653 region:rollup2
PROVIDER DIRECTORY LAW TIMELY

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:35.488 region:rollup2
ACCESS REQUIREMENTS ARE RELEVANT

02:11:34.653 --> 02:11:37.223 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL INFORMATION FOR RATE

02:11:35.488 --> 02:11:38.524 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

02:11:37.223 --> 02:11:39.525 region:rollup2
WHEN PROVIDERS ARE NON

02:11:38.524 --> 02:11:41.093 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE IT BECOMES MORE

02:11:39.525 --> 02:11:42.361 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME ON

02:11:41.093 --> 02:11:43.462 region:rollup2
THE PLAN TO ENSURE ACCURACY

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:44.697 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE PLANS MOST

02:11:43.462 --> 02:11:46.365 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY FOLLOW UP WITH THEIR

02:11:44.697 --> 02:11:48.167 region:rollup2
CONTRACT PROVIDER GROUPS.

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:49.969 region:rollup2
SO IN RECOGNITION OF THIS

02:11:48.167 --> 02:11:51.604 region:rollup2
PROBLEM PRIOR LEGISLATION.

02:11:49.969 --> 02:11:52.705 region:rollup2
DOES A AND I'M THINKING

02:11:51.604 --> 02:11:53.773 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY OF THE PROVIDER

02:11:52.705 --> 02:11:55.574 region:rollup2
DIRECTORY LEGISLATION FROM A

02:11:53.773 --> 02:11:57.476 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. ACTUALLY

02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:59.145 region:rollup2
ALLOWS PLANS TO DELAY PAYMENT TO

02:11:57.476 --> 02:12:00.346 region:rollup2
PROVIDER PROVIDER GROUP IS IF

02:11:59.145 --> 02:12:02.014 region:rollup2
THERE IS A FAILURE TO PROVIDE

02:12:00.346 --> 02:12:04.116 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION TO TO.

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:04.717 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THE DIRECTORIES

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:07.253 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO EQUIVALENT FEATURE

02:12:04.717 --> 02:12:08.320 region:rollup2
HERE. FINALLY THE BILL CREATES

02:12:07.253 --> 02:12:09.622 region:rollup2
AN ENTIRELY NEW GOVERNMENT

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.956 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE TO GOVERN THE TYPE

02:12:09.622 --> 02:12:12.291 region:rollup2
OF PRIMARY CARRIED OUT OF THE

02:12:10.956 --> 02:12:13.459 region:rollup2
PLANS WOULD REPORT.

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:14.994 region:rollup2
THIS COLLABORATIVE WOULD BE

02:12:13.459 --> 02:12:15.861 region:rollup2
AFTER THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

02:12:14.994 --> 02:12:17.396 region:rollup2
ON THE PLANS OF ALREADY KICKED

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:18.564 region:rollup2
IN. WHICH MEANS THAT THE

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:18.731 region:rollup2
STANDARDS COULD CHANGE DOWN THE

02:12:18.564 --> 02:12:20.833 region:rollup2
LINE

02:12:18.731 --> 02:12:24.069 region:rollup2
IF IN SHORT A WERE OPPOSED TO

02:12:20.833 --> 02:12:25.104 region:rollup2
THE BILL TAKE.

02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:26.739 region:rollup2
STEPHANIE WATKINS ON BEHALF OF

02:12:25.104 --> 02:12:28.007 region:rollup2
THIS VISION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE

02:12:26.739 --> 02:12:29.842 region:rollup2
AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES

02:12:28.007 --> 02:12:31.177 region:rollup2
WE TOO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BELL

02:12:29.842 --> 02:12:32.778 region:rollup2
I'M UNFORTUNATELY WHILE WE

02:12:31.177 --> 02:12:34.713 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS AND

02:12:32.778 --> 02:12:36.449 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN THIS AREA IT'S NOT

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:37.850 region:rollup2
CLEAR TO US WHAT BENEFIT THIS

02:12:36.449 --> 02:12:39.852 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WOULD PROVIDE.

02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:41.854 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN CONTEXT OF THE PPO

02:12:39.852 --> 02:12:44.056 region:rollup2
WHERE THE ENSURE THEMSELVES CAN

02:12:41.854 --> 02:12:45.958 region:rollup2
SELF REFER AND CHOOSE TO GO TO A

02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:47.693 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST DIRECTLY VERSUS GOING

02:12:45.958 --> 02:12:49.094 region:rollup2
TO A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. SO

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:50.529 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT IF YOU

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:52.798 region:rollup2
COLLECT THIS INFORMATION AND

02:12:50.529 --> 02:12:54.066 region:rollup2
PUBLISH IT WHAT REAL BENEFIT

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:55.467 region:rollup2
pOTHER THAN ADDITIONAL COSTS

02:12:54.066 --> 02:12:57.369 region:rollup2
WOULD PROVIDE TO CONSUMER AND

02:12:55.467 --> 02:12:58.604 region:rollup2
COMPARING THAT. ESPECIALLY GIVEN

02:12:57.369 --> 02:13:00.306 region:rollup2
THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE

02:12:58.604 --> 02:13:03.542 region:rollup2
WITH THE PPO TO CHOOSE

02:13:00.306 --> 02:13:04.710 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES TO SEEK CARE THROUGH

02:13:03.542 --> 02:13:06.278 region:rollup2
A SPECIALIST EAT.

02:13:04.710 --> 02:13:07.446 region:rollup2
TO COMPARE PLAN TO PLAN IT WOULD

02:13:06.278 --> 02:13:09.114 region:rollup2
ALSO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

02:13:07.446 --> 02:13:09.982 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CONTRACT RATES IT

02:13:09.114 --> 02:13:11.917 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REALLY

02:13:09.982 --> 02:13:13.986 region:rollup2
GARNER AS A CONSUMER A LACK OF

02:13:11.917 --> 02:13:15.588 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT THAT THE PPL HAD IN

02:13:13.986 --> 02:13:17.323 region:rollup2
THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS.

02:13:15.588 --> 02:13:18.490 region:rollup2
BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHERE WE

02:13:17.323 --> 02:13:20.059 region:rollup2
WHAT REGIONS THERE AND WHAT

02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:21.193 region:rollup2
CONTRACT RATES THEY PAY YOU

02:13:20.059 --> 02:13:22.928 region:rollup2
MIGHT SEE DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:13:21.193 --> 02:13:24.697 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THEY'RE

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:26.131 region:rollup2
REPORTING WHICH HAS NOTHING TO

02:13:24.697 --> 02:13:27.900 region:rollup2
DO WITH ACTUALLY THE VALUE OF

02:13:26.131 --> 02:13:29.301 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY PUT THEIR. FOR THEIR

02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:30.536 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS.

02:13:29.301 --> 02:13:31.604 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE ADDITIONALLY WE ARE

02:13:30.536 --> 02:13:34.073 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT.

02:13:31.604 --> 02:13:36.108 region:rollup2
UNDER THE REGULATIONS YOU CAN

ARE SPECIALIST AS YOUR PRIMARY

02:13:39.912 --> 02:13:42.615 region:rollup2
CARE PHYSICIAN. WE'RE NOT SURE

02:13:41.413 --> 02:13:44.483 region:rollup2
HOW THAT WOULD NECESSARILY BE

02:13:42.615 --> 02:13:46.285 region:rollup2
REPORTED BUT CERTAINLY IT CAN BE

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:48.020 region:rollup2
DEBT ADDITIONALLY SKEW THOSE

02:13:46.285 --> 02:13:49.321 region:rollup2
NUMBERS THAT YOU MIGHT SEE IF

02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:51.090 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A EXISTING RELATIONSHIP

02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:53.125 region:rollup2
WITH SENIOR OB. YOU CAN GET YOUR

02:13:51.090 --> 02:13:55.394 region:rollup2
FLU SHOT FROM THEM VERSUS YOUR

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:56.428 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE AYE AND AND HOW

02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:57.997 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT RELATE INTO THE

INFORMATION WAS BEING REPORTED

02:13:57.997 --> 02:14:01.400 region:rollup2
AND HOW WOULD THAT BE. AVAILABLE

02:13:59.665 --> 02:14:02.568 region:rollup2
TO CONSUMERS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:04.169 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THE

02:14:02.568 --> 02:14:05.971 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT THE

02:14:04.169 --> 02:14:07.606 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AND THE PROVIDER

02:14:05.971 --> 02:14:09.174 region:rollup2

02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:11.610 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY REMAIN OPPOSED TO

02:14:09.174 --> 02:14:15.748 region:rollup2

TO ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

02:14:15.748 --> 02:14:17.950 region:rollup2

02:28:00.171 --> 02:28:03.608 region:rollup2
AT THE COMMITTEE IF THERE WAS

NOT IN A ROBUST TAKEOVER PROCESS

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:05.477 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR THERE IS.

02:28:04.342 --> 02:28:07.746 region:rollup2
A FEEDBACK THAT THE DEPARTMENT

ELICITS FOR EIGHTY FIVE DOCUMENT

02:28:07.746 --> 02:28:11.816 region:rollup2
IT PURPORTS OUT ON THE THINGS TO

02:28:09.581 --> 02:28:13.151 region:rollup2
CONSIDER SINCE IN. QUALITY I

02:28:11.816 --> 02:28:14.619 region:rollup2
THINK THE PIECE THAT WE'RE.

02:28:13.151 --> 02:28:16.454 region:rollup2
HOPING TO CHANGE THAT THERE'S

02:28:14.619 --> 02:28:18.757 region:rollup2
NOT A CONCLUSION TO WHAT THOSE

02:28:16.454 --> 02:28:18.957 region:rollup2
EXPECT WHEN IN SETTING WHAT

02:28:18.757 --> 02:28:21.025 region:rollup2
THOSE.

02:28:18.957 --> 02:28:22.160 region:rollup2
GOALS ARE RIGHT SO THEY CAN

02:28:21.025 --> 02:28:23.828 region:rollup2
HAVE A DOCUMENTS A HEAR HEAR

02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:25.063 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO

02:28:23.828 --> 02:28:25.997 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:28:25.063 --> 02:28:27.198 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SETTING WHAT THOSE

02:28:25.997 --> 02:28:28.700 region:rollup2
MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVELS ARE

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:30.135 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE REALLY THE. THINGS

02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.536 region:rollup2
THAT HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO

02:28:30.135 --> 02:28:32.537 region:rollup2
THEIR PERFORMANCE ARE NOT A A

02:28:31.536 --> 02:28:34.072 region:rollup2
ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT.

02:28:32.537 --> 02:28:35.373 region:rollup2
THE SELECTION OF PARTICULAR

02:28:34.072 --> 02:28:37.308 region:rollup2
MEASURES WE KNOW THAT COULD

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:38.676 region:rollup2
CONSULT SOME STAKEHOLDERS BUT.

02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:40.412 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES WE KNOW THAT A

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:43.281 region:rollup2
CONSUMER STAKEHOLDERS OTHERS ARE

02:28:40.412 --> 02:28:43.615 region:rollup2
NOT IN THE ROOMS AND FOR THIS

02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:45.517 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

02:28:43.615 --> 02:28:46.351 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS STAKEHOLDER.

02:28:45.517 --> 02:28:47.418 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE

02:28:46.351 --> 02:28:48.253 region:rollup2
WOULD CONSIDER ROBUST YOU

02:28:47.418 --> 02:28:50.755 region:rollup2
CONSIDER ROBUST SO.

02:28:48.253 --> 02:28:53.491 region:rollup2
.

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:54.926 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT.

02:28:53.491 --> 02:28:56.528 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN

02:28:54.926 --> 02:28:57.695 region:rollup2
THE D. H. CSS STAKEHOLDER

02:28:56.528 --> 02:28:59.964 region:rollup2
PROCESS I YOU KNOW DO

02:28:57.695 --> 02:29:01.599 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION CAP HAS REGULATORY

02:28:59.964 --> 02:29:03.368 region:rollup2
STAFF THAT PARTICIPATES IN THAT.

02:29:01.599 --> 02:29:05.136 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:29:03.368 --> 02:29:06.838 region:rollup2
IF ANYBODY INCLUDING YOU KNOW

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:08.239 region:rollup2
CAP OR ANY ORGANIZATION HAD A

02:29:06.838 --> 02:29:09.140 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT THE PROCESS THE

02:29:08.239 --> 02:29:10.775 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A

02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:12.777 region:rollup2
PROBABLY REQUEST A MEETING WITH

02:29:10.775 --> 02:29:14.379 region:rollup2
THEM. THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:16.247 region:rollup2
REQUIRED IT REAP REQUIRED THEIR

02:29:14.379 --> 02:29:17.582 region:rollup2
REPORT TO THE PUBLISHED IN MARCH

02:29:16.247 --> 02:29:18.383 region:rollup2
STATES THAT THEY HAVE ONE.

02:29:17.582 --> 02:29:19.818 region:rollup2
THAT'S I WOULD THINK THAT IF AN

02:29:18.383 --> 02:29:22.687 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION AT QUESTIONS ON

02:29:19.818 --> 02:29:23.955 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT PROCESS WAS THAT THEY

02:29:22.687 --> 02:29:25.957 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT.

02:29:23.955 --> 02:29:27.225 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A COMMENT.

02:29:25.957 --> 02:29:28.593 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT PERHAPS WE MAY HAVE

02:29:27.225 --> 02:29:30.328 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THAT.

02:29:28.593 --> 02:29:31.396 region:rollup2
HAVING ATTENDED SOME OF THOSE

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:33.565 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND.

02:29:31.396 --> 02:29:35.300 region:rollup2
TALK TO SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES

02:29:33.565 --> 02:29:36.468 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEM WE THINK THAT THERE

02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:38.236 region:rollup2
COULD BE IMPROVEMENT WE DO THINK

02:29:36.468 --> 02:29:39.237 region:rollup2
THAT FOR INSTANCE IN SELECT

02:29:38.236 --> 02:29:39.904 region:rollup2
SELECTING SOME OF THOSE HE JUST

02:29:39.237 --> 02:29:42.607 region:rollup2
MEASURES.

02:29:39.904 --> 02:29:43.775 region:rollup2
WE HEAR AFTER THE FACT THAT

02:29:42.607 --> 02:29:44.375 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS HAS DECIDED

02:29:43.775 --> 02:29:45.543 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO

02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:47.078 region:rollup2
BE.

02:29:45.543 --> 02:29:49.047 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THAT WE.

02:29:47.078 --> 02:29:51.516 region:rollup2
INHERENTLY OBJECT TO SOME OF

02:29:49.047 --> 02:29:52.016 region:rollup2
THE THE THE METRICS ARE CHOSEN

02:29:51.516 --> 02:29:54.085 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THEY ARE THE

02:29:52.016 --> 02:29:55.920 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE ONES BUT SOMETIMES.

02:29:54.085 --> 02:29:56.120 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE IN CONVERSATIONS

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:57.755 region:rollup2
WITH.

02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:58.523 region:rollup2
OUR FRIENDS IN THE CHILDREN'S.

02:29:57.755 --> 02:30:00.625 region:rollup2
GROUPS.

02:29:58.523 --> 02:30:01.559 region:rollup2
IF THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE

02:30:00.625 --> 02:30:02.927 region:rollup2
OTHER CHIP.

02:30:01.559 --> 02:30:04.229 region:rollup2
CHILD SPECIFIC METRICS THEY

02:30:02.927 --> 02:30:06.097 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED BUT

02:30:04.229 --> 02:30:06.631 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOTIFIED AFTER THE FACT

02:30:06.097 --> 02:30:07.365 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THE ONES THAT WE'VE

02:30:06.631 --> 02:30:08.399 region:rollup2
CHOSEN.

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:09.467 region:rollup2
SO THAT SO THAT'S WHERE THE

02:30:08.399 --> 02:30:10.335 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT IS HAPPENING IS

02:30:09.467 --> 02:30:12.070 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES IT'S REPORTED OUT HIS

02:30:10.335 --> 02:30:12.871 region:rollup2
WILL BE CHOSEN

02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:14.105 region:rollup2
YES YOU'RE ENGAGING US BUT

02:30:12.871 --> 02:30:15.240 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT REALLY OFFERING US AN

02:30:14.105 --> 02:30:16.641 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON

02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:17.275 region:rollup2
WHETHER. THESE MIGHT BE THE MOST

02:30:16.641 --> 02:30:17.442 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE THINGS TO BE LOOKING

02:30:17.275 --> 02:30:20.078 region:rollup2
AT.

02:30:17.442 --> 02:30:21.346 region:rollup2
KIND OF.

02:30:20.078 --> 02:30:22.947 region:rollup2
IT AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT I

02:30:21.346 --> 02:30:25.316 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THINKING ABOUT THE

02:30:22.947 --> 02:30:27.619 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY SET THAT

02:30:25.316 --> 02:30:28.853 region:rollup2
WAS SIZE. SUBMITTED FOR COMMENT

02:30:27.619 --> 02:30:30.221 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN I HAVE

02:30:28.853 --> 02:30:30.855 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS WORK WORKS AT

02:30:30.221 --> 02:30:32.991 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OF THOSE

02:30:30.855 --> 02:30:33.892 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS WORK DISCUSSES

02:30:32.991 --> 02:30:34.359 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT THE STAKEHOLDER

02:30:33.892 --> 02:30:36.194 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND SAID THAT

02:30:34.359 --> 02:30:37.962 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

02:30:36.194 --> 02:30:40.331 region:rollup2
ON SPECIFIC TO MISS JONES POINT

02:30:37.962 --> 02:30:40.832 region:rollup2
ABOUT CERTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS

02:30:40.331 --> 02:30:42.233 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AROUND THE

02:30:40.832 --> 02:30:44.102 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S AYE ADDING CERTAIN

02:30:42.233 --> 02:30:46.104 region:rollup2
METRICS WERE NOT INCLUDED AND

THERE WAS NO BUDGET. NOT A

02:30:46.104 --> 02:30:49.240 region:rollup2
ROBUST DISCUSSION AROUND THAT

02:30:47.305 --> 02:30:50.875 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:53.244 region:rollup2
COMMENT BUT A WHETHER THOSE

02:30:50.875 --> 02:30:53.645 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ARE INCORPORATED IS A

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:56.414 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STORY.

02:30:53.645 --> 02:30:57.015 region:rollup2

02:32:39.350 --> 02:32:43.321 region:rollup2
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT

02:32:40.818 --> 02:32:44.789 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT.

02:32:43.321 --> 02:32:46.557 region:rollup2
IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS BELIEF

02:32:44.789 --> 02:32:47.859 region:rollup2
THAT I BECAME A DOCTOR.

02:32:46.557 --> 02:32:50.461 region:rollup2

02:32:54.265 --> 02:32:59.103 region:rollup2
AS A DOCTOR I SAW THE CHALLENGES

02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:00.805 region:rollup2
FACING MANY CALIFORNIANS TRYING

02:32:59.103 --> 02:33:02.373 region:rollup2
TO GET GOOD MEDICAL CARE.

02:33:00.805 --> 02:33:03.741 region:rollup2
I ALSO SAW MANY OF THE

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:05.309 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS OF OUR CURRENT

02:33:03.741 --> 02:33:07.445 region:rollup2

VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:13.084 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT

02:33:13.084 --> 02:33:16.120 region:rollup2

MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE TOO

02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:25.963 region:rollup2
LITTLE MEDICAL CARE AND TO

02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:28.066 region:rollup2
RECEIVE IT TOO LATE.

02:33:25.963 --> 02:33:31.002 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT.

02:33:28.066 --> 02:33:33.004 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SECKER AND DIE SOONER.

02:33:31.002 --> 02:33:34.305 region:rollup2
I HAVE SEEN THIS FIRST HAND.

02:33:33.004 --> 02:33:36.040 region:rollup2

RUN THIS PROGRAM. WELL MY

02:47:00.077 --> 02:47:03.447 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT STILL WAS

02:47:01.378 --> 02:47:05.716 region:rollup2
A POLICY COMMITTEE AND NOT THERE

02:47:03.447 --> 02:47:08.118 region:rollup2
FISCAL SIDE OF THINGS AND.

02:47:05.716 --> 02:47:10.254 region:rollup2
BUT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

02:47:08.118 --> 02:47:11.588 region:rollup2
SO. LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE

02:47:10.254 --> 02:47:13.824 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT HEALTH FOR ALL YOUNG

02:47:11.588 --> 02:47:15.993 region:rollup2
ADULTS THE PRICE TAG FOR THAT

02:47:13.824 --> 02:47:17.561 region:rollup2
SECTION WAS ANYWHERE BETWEEN.

02:47:15.993 --> 02:47:18.428 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE AND NINETY MILLION

02:47:17.561 --> 02:47:19.630 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD HAVE INCREASED

02:47:18.428 --> 02:47:21.131 region:rollup2
THE AGE FROM EIGHTEEN UP TO

02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:23.667 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX.

02:47:21.131 --> 02:47:25.235 region:rollup2
AND I CAN SAY WITHOUT GETTING

02:47:23.667 --> 02:47:27.271 region:rollup2
INTO SPECIFICS THAT IT'S LESS

02:47:25.235 --> 02:47:28.305 region:rollup2
THAN THE SIZE OF OUR SURPLUS.

02:47:27.271 --> 02:47:30.440 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE TO

02:47:28.305 --> 02:47:32.075 region:rollup2
BE DEALT WITH AS WE GO THROUGH

02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:32.542 region:rollup2

LEGISLATURE.

02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:40.183 region:rollup2

ADDRESS GOING FORWARD.

02:47:40.183 --> 02:47:43.086 region:rollup2

I THINK HEAR TO THE AUTHOR OUT

IN THE VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONY I

02:47:48.125 --> 02:47:52.129 region:rollup2
JUST WANNA SAY THAT REGARDLESS

OF LEGAL STATUS OR LANGUAGE.

02:47:52.129 --> 02:47:54.598 region:rollup2
THIS IS STILL THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE

02:47:53.397 --> 02:47:56.433 region:rollup2

THE COVERED CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS

02:55:34.824 --> 02:55:38.094 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LEARNED THE HARD WAY

02:55:36.192 --> 02:55:39.896 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT BRUNCH COVERAGE MEANS

THAT CAN BE VERY COSTLY AND IT'S

03:11:25.474 --> 03:11:30.179 region:rollup2
NOT EFFICIENT.

03:11:28.477 --> 03:11:32.448 region:rollup2
THERE IS THAT EVENTUALLY THEY

03:20:14.970 --> 03:20:17.339 region:rollup2
MORE INCREASING AFFORDABILITY

03:20:16.037 --> 03:20:18.807 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE SMALL BUSINESSES MORE

LEVEL. PLAN WITH THE CREDIT THE

03:22:01.443 --> 03:22:03.845 region:rollup2
WAY IT WOULD WORK IS THAT THEY

WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN

03:22:03.845 --> 03:22:07.349 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT OF WHAT THE BRONZE

03:22:05.780 --> 03:22:08.617 region:rollup2

PURCHASE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE

LEVEL FOR THEIR FAMILY. WE

03:22:11.953 --> 03:22:13.588 region:rollup2
SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO

03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:15.590 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:22:13.588 --> 03:22:16.891 region:rollup2
SO FOR SOME PEOPLE IT THERE.

03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:18.259 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE MORE

03:22:16.891 --> 03:22:18.960 region:rollup2
COVERAGE THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION

03:22:18.259 --> 03:22:20.261 region:rollup2
FOR THEM THAT WE WOULD MAKE

03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:22.731 region:rollup2
SENSE OKAY.

03:22:20.261 --> 03:22:24.432 region:rollup2
AND THEN I I HAD BEEN WONDERING

03:22:22.731 --> 03:22:26.034 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS OF

MAJORITY THE SMALL BUSINESSES

03:22:26.034 --> 03:22:28.937 region:rollup2
BEING IMPACTED BUT WHEN YOU

03:22:27.602 --> 03:22:30.305 region:rollup2
SPOKE IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE

03:22:28.937 --> 03:22:31.940 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. I'M ON THE SMALL

03:22:30.305 --> 03:22:33.141 region:rollup2
BUSINESS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS

03:22:31.940 --> 03:22:34.242 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE

03:22:33.141 --> 03:22:36.177 region:rollup2
I MEAN IF I DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER

03:22:34.242 --> 03:22:37.078 region:rollup2
JOB OR YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND AT

03:22:36.177 --> 03:22:38.179 region:rollup2
SOME POINT.

03:22:37.078 --> 03:22:39.080 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD HAVE

AFFORDED IT.

03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:43.551 region:rollup2

COMMITTEE.

03:22:49.724 --> 03:22:52.761 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS WHEN YOU

03:22:51.693 --> 03:22:55.397 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT

03:22:52.761 --> 03:22:57.265 region:rollup2

03:22:55.397 --> 03:22:59.934 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MAKE ENOUGH WITH ME. TO

03:22:57.265 --> 03:23:01.703 region:rollup2
MEET THEIR ABOVE THE LIMITS BUT

03:22:59.934 --> 03:23:04.139 region:rollup2
ONCE AGAIN IT'S STILL MUCH MORE

03:23:01.703 --> 03:23:05.573 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME THAT

03:23:04.139 --> 03:23:08.109 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD HAVE TO SPEND SO THEY

03:23:05.573 --> 03:23:10.512 region:rollup2
OPT NOT TO BE INSURED. AND THIS.

03:23:08.109 --> 03:23:13.882 region:rollup2
THIS DIRECTLY GOES TO SOME OF

03:23:10.512 --> 03:23:14.716 region:rollup2

03:42:59.466 --> 03:43:02.636 region:rollup2
LAST NOVEMBER WHEN OIL CARE

03:43:19.920 --> 03:43:23.490 region:rollup2
MY HOPE WAS TO GIVE THE CITY AND

ANOTHER PROVIDER TO PREVENT THE

03:43:29.162 --> 03:43:31.298 region:rollup2
CLOSURE OF THIS CRITICAL

03:43:29.897 --> 03:43:33.100 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL.

03:43:31.298 --> 03:43:34.635 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

03:43:34.635 --> 03:43:37.271 region:rollup2
ACCELERATED THEIR CLOSURE

03:43:35.535 --> 03:43:38.505 region:rollup2
TIMELINE.

03:43:37.271 --> 03:43:40.340 region:rollup2
THIS MAKES IT ALL THE MORE

03:43:38.505 --> 03:43:42.542 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR THE CITY TO SECURE

03:43:40.340 --> 03:43:44.044 region:rollup2
AND OTHER PROVIDER.

03:43:42.542 --> 03:43:46.380 region:rollup2
MEMORIAL CARE COULD HAVE AND

03:43:44.044 --> 03:43:47.147 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE HAD AN OPEN DIALOGUE

03:43:46.380 --> 03:43:48.548 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMUNITY AND

03:43:47.147 --> 03:43:50.417 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS WHEN THEY FIRST

03:43:48.548 --> 03:43:52.286 region:rollup2

THEIR ABILITY. TO OPERATE

COMMUNITY HOSPITAL.

03:43:53.987 --> 03:43:56.556 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TO

03:43:55.322 --> 03:43:58.592 region:rollup2
PREPARE FOR THEIR DEPARTURE

03:43:56.556 --> 03:44:00.861 region:rollup2

03:44:00.861 --> 03:44:03.463 region:rollup2
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:44:14.741 --> 03:44:18.111 region:rollup2
HANGING IN THE BALANCE.

03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:19.579 region:rollup2
THE CLOSURE OF COMMUNITY

03:44:19.579 --> 03:44:24.184 region:rollup2
CAPACITY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTHCARE

03:44:24.184 --> 03:44:27.020 region:rollup2
IT WILL ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY

.

04:02:14.620 --> 04:02:18.157 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHT EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO

04:02:16.188 --> 04:02:20.259 region:rollup2
TO SIXTEEN YEARS AGO I'VE SERVED

04:02:18.157 --> 04:02:22.561 region:rollup2
ON THE OXY TASK FORCE IN SAN

04:02:20.259 --> 04:02:24.463 region:rollup2
DIEGO. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

04:02:22.561 --> 04:02:25.865 region:rollup2
THAT CAME UP WAS AND IT'S STILL

04:02:24.463 --> 04:02:27.366 region:rollup2
TRUE TODAY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

04:02:25.865 --> 04:02:29.635 region:rollup2
DONE ENOUGH EDUCATION.

04:02:27.366 --> 04:02:30.836 region:rollup2
IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE

04:02:29.635 --> 04:02:33.005 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S PRESCRIPTION THAT

04:02:30.836 --> 04:02:34.840 region:rollup2
IT'S SAFE.

04:02:33.005 --> 04:02:36.642 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BEEN AN ONGOING YOU

04:02:34.840 --> 04:02:38.177 region:rollup2
KNOW PROBLEM OF WHY. THESE

04:02:36.642 --> 04:02:39.311 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE BEING

04:02:38.177 --> 04:02:40.546 region:rollup2
USED THE WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE

04:02:39.311 --> 04:02:41.447 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE SAFE

04:02:40.546 --> 04:02:43.416 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE.

04:02:41.447 --> 04:02:45.184 region:rollup2
.

04:02:43.416 --> 04:02:47.086 region:rollup2
AND AS I MENTIONED IN THE LAST

04:02:45.184 --> 04:02:49.188 region:rollup2
HEALTH HEARING.

04:02:47.086 --> 04:02:52.725 region:rollup2
SERVING ON THE STANFORD.

04:02:49.188 --> 04:02:53.993 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE ON THE DRUG POLICY.

04:02:52.725 --> 04:02:55.761 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP

04:02:53.993 --> 04:02:57.630 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THERE'S THAT WINDOW OF

04:02:55.761 --> 04:02:59.365 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY BETWEEN AGE ELEVEN

04:02:57.630 --> 04:03:02.134 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY FIVE THAT KIDS ARE

04:02:59.365 --> 04:03:04.837 region:rollup2
MOST SUSCEPTIBLE. TO GETTING

04:03:02.134 --> 04:03:06.705 region:rollup2
ADDICTED TO UP A DRUG LIKE THIS

04:03:04.837 --> 04:03:08.174 region:rollup2
AND THAT IF WE'RE GONNA SPEND

04:03:06.705 --> 04:03:17.416 region:rollup2
ANY MONEY AND TIME WE NEED TO

04:03:08.174 --> 04:03:17.950 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON THIS RANGE OF OF TIME.

04:03:17.416 --> 04:03:18.217 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:20.519 region:rollup2
GETTING.

04:03:18.217 --> 04:03:22.021 region:rollup2
YEAH EVEN THE AGE TWENTY SEVEN

04:03:20.519 --> 04:03:24.523 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT'S RIGHT THERE SO.

04:03:22.021 --> 04:03:28.260 region:rollup2
ALSO ANOTHER FACTOR IS NINETY

04:03:24.523 --> 04:03:29.862 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT OF OVERDOSE PATIENTS

04:03:28.260 --> 04:03:31.730 region:rollup2
ARE LATER PRESCRIBE AN OPEN.

04:03:29.862 --> 04:03:32.932 region:rollup2
SO THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE

04:03:31.730 --> 04:03:35.534 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON

04:03:32.932 --> 04:03:35.835 region:rollup2
ON.

04:03:35.534 --> 04:03:38.204 region:rollup2
I KNOW ITS.

SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE

04:11:07.586 --> 04:11:11.223 region:rollup2
SEEN AYE WITH OUR LEGAL SERVICES

04:11:09.621 --> 04:11:11.757 region:rollup2

ENGLISH.

04:11:18.230 --> 04:11:21.066 region:rollup2
THIS MIGHT BE DUE TO HOW THE

04:11:19.464 --> 04:11:21.633 region:rollup2
MATERIALS ARE POPULATED BUT A

04:11:21.066 --> 04:11:23.135 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY REVIEW WOULD HAVE

PROPER NOUNS.

04:11:27.172 --> 04:11:30.042 region:rollup2
HOW A PERSON READERS OF SOME

04:11:30.042 --> 04:11:32.444 region:rollup2
USED IN THE ENGLISH ALPHABET SO

04:11:31.610 --> 04:11:34.079 region:rollup2
THIS JUST LEAVES A MORE

04:11:32.444 --> 04:11:35.581 region:rollup2
SENTENCES WITH INEXPLICABLE

04:11:34.079 --> 04:11:36.815 region:rollup2

04:11:36.815 --> 04:11:40.185 region:rollup2
NEED AN EXPLANATION OF THE

04:11:38.050 --> 04:11:41.453 region:rollup2
UNTRANSLATED TERMS.

04:11:40.185 --> 04:11:42.421 region:rollup2
SOME TRANSLATED MATERIALS ARE

ARMENIAN FOR EXAMPLE HAS BOTH

04:11:46.758 --> 04:11:49.595 region:rollup2

04:11:49.595 --> 04:11:52.497 region:rollup2
THAT MATERIALS CAN BE PRODUCED

04:11:50.996 --> 04:11:53.665 region:rollup2
THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE BY BOTH

04:11:52.497 --> 04:11:54.800 region:rollup2
BUT ONLY IF MEMBERS OF THE

04:11:53.665 --> 04:11:56.868 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ACTUALLY REVIEW THESE

04:11:54.800 --> 04:11:58.203 region:rollup2

CONSUMERS REPORT RECEIVING

04:11:58.203 --> 04:12:01.073 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THAT ARE TOO FORMAL.

04:11:59.705 --> 04:12:02.374 region:rollup2
JUST AS READERS OF ENGLISH WOULD

04:12:01.073 --> 04:12:03.742 region:rollup2
NOT UNDERSTAND MATERIALS WRITTEN

LANGUAGES STONE AS WELL AND

04:12:07.613 --> 04:12:10.082 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THIS IS ACTUALLY

04:12:08.714 --> 04:12:11.817 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE TRANSLATOR IS VERY

04:12:10.082 --> 04:12:13.885 region:rollup2
EDUCATED AND THE RELY ON THE

04:12:11.817 --> 04:12:15.220 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY THAT THEY KNOW.

04:12:13.885 --> 04:12:17.389 region:rollup2
SOME TRANSLATIONS ARE LITERAL

04:12:15.220 --> 04:12:18.490 region:rollup2
BUT NOT UNDERSTANDABLE.

04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:20.025 region:rollup2

04:12:22.828 --> 04:12:24.363 region:rollup2
IF THEY SPEAK TRADITIONAL

04:12:23.762 --> 04:12:26.164 region:rollup2
CHINESE THEY CAN GET LANGUAGE

04:12:24.363 --> 04:12:27.199 region:rollup2

04:12:26.164 --> 04:12:28.734 region:rollup2
NOBODY ACTUALLY SPEAKS

04:12:27.199 --> 04:12:30.268 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL CHINESE THEY SPEAK

04:12:28.734 --> 04:12:31.536 region:rollup2
MANDARIN OR CANTONESE AND SO IT

04:12:30.268 --> 04:12:33.672 region:rollup2
SEEMS THAT THE TRANSLATOR WAS

04:12:31.536 --> 04:12:35.307 region:rollup2
JUST TRANSLATING INSTRUCTION.

04:12:33.672 --> 04:12:36.641 region:rollup2

REDUCE THE VITAL SERVICES

04:25:03.821 --> 04:25:06.958 region:rollup2
FACILITIES OFFER. WHICH USUALLY

04:25:05.923 --> 04:25:08.526 region:rollup2
MAKES THE FINAL CLOSURE OF THE

04:25:06.958 --> 04:25:10.061 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL INEVITABLE.

04:25:08.526 --> 04:25:10.862 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF HASTENING OF CLOSURE

04:25:10.061 --> 04:25:12.296 region:rollup2
THE POSES A THREAT TO THE

ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

04:25:19.937 --> 04:25:23.107 region:rollup2
WE DID HAVE A NURSE WHO ISHERE

04:25:21.439 --> 04:25:23.808 region:rollup2

A FLIGHT.

04:25:23.808 --> 04:25:27.345 region:rollup2

WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY WHICH

04:25:27.345 --> 04:25:30.081 region:rollup2
SHE WORKED FOR COMMUNITY

04:25:28.212 --> 04:25:31.482 region:rollup2

INTERESTED IN TAKING OVER THEIR

04:25:35.419 --> 04:25:39.724 region:rollup2
TO THEM BECAUSE THE MORE TIME

04:25:37.655 --> 04:25:41.626 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES ARE GIVEN TO ORGANIZE

04:25:39.724 --> 04:25:43.694 region:rollup2
A PLAN WHEN A HOSPITAL SAYS

04:25:41.626 --> 04:25:44.295 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE. THE MORE

04:25:43.694 --> 04:25:45.196 region:rollup2
LIKELY WE ARE TO HAVE A BETTER

04:25:44.295 --> 04:25:46.631 region:rollup2
