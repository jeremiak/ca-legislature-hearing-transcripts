INFORMATIONAL HEARING. I WANT TO FIRST START BY OUT WELL CAME WELCOMING EVERYBODY HAD TO TODAY'S HEARING. RELATED TO THE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD. THE CFPB WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO. THE CRISIS THAT RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES LOSING THEIR HOMES. AND PUT THE NATION ON THE BRINK OF A FULL SCALE ECONOMIC MELTDOWN. LEADING UP TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OUR COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY WAS SHARED. OUR COUNTRY FINANCIAL REGULATORY THIRTY WAS SHARED AMONG HALF A pNOT COMMUNICATE OR COORDINATE WELL TOGETHER. FURTHERMORE NONE OF THE AGENCIES HAVE A CLEAR MISSION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. RATHER MANY WERE WORKING TOWARD A VAGUE NOTION OF SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS. OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IN HINDSIGHT THIS SYSTEM WAS DOOMED TO FAIL. LEARNING FROM THOSE MISTAKES PRESIDENT OBAMA AND CONGRESS ENACTED THE DODD FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF TWENTY TEN OF THE MANY REFORMS INCLUDED IN THE DODD FRANK. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISH A FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENCY THAT WOULD PUT CONSUMERS FIRST. THE CLEAR MISSION OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS ALLOWED THE CFPB TO FLOURISH. PRESIDENT OBAMA APPOINTED RICHARD CORDRAY AS DIRECTOR OF THE CFPB IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHERE HE SERVED UNTIL HIS DEPARTURE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UNDER MR CORD REYES LEADERSHIP THE CFPB TWELVE MILLION BACK IN THE POCKETS OF TWENTY NINE MILLION CONSUMERS AS THE PURE PROTECT. BROUGHT CASES AGAINST BANKS LENDERS AND DEBT COLLECTORS FOR ILLEGAL PRACTICES. IT IS THE ABOLITION NEW UNDERWRITING RULES FOR MORTGAGE LENDERS TO MAKE A WRIT REASONABLE DETERMINATION THAT FARMERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REPAY THE LOAN. AND DEVELOP HUNDREDS OF WELL DESIGNED AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL SO THAT CONSUMERS ARE ARMED WITH INFORM INFORMATION TO HELP THEM GET THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE WHEN SHOPPING FOR A MORTGAGE AN AUTO LOAN. STUDENT LOAN. OR PLANNING FOR RETIREMENT. I AM EXCITED FOR TODAY'S HEARING. AND THAT MISTER CORDRAY AND OTHER FORMER CFPB OFFICIALS ARE ABLE TO JOIN OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND FINANCIAL ISSUES TO BE CONFUSING OR NOT IMPORTANT. DON'T ALWAYS KNOW HOW THE SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO WORK AND I CAN UNDERSTAND IF THEY CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON OTHER ISSUES THEY FEEL MORE ARE MORE TANGIBLE OR MORE IMPORTANT TO THEIR LIVES. BUT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I AM MOST STRIVEN BY MY ROLE AS BANKING CHAIR IS THAT FINANCIAL SERVICES AFFECT. ALL OF US ON A DAILY BASIS AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT POLICIES RELATED TO FINANCIAL SERVICES PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN WHETHER CONSUMERS ARE GETTING A FAIR DEAL WHEN THEY GAUGE WITH THESE COMPANIES. GETTING A BETTER INTEREST RATE ON A MORTGAGE OR CAR LOAN CAN SAVE A FAMILY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. ALLOWING THEM TO SPEND THAT MONEY ON OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED. AND CREATE A HEALTHY LIFE. ELIMINATING PREDATORY BUSINESSES AND PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET CAN HELP FAMILIES AVOID THE DEVASTATING FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES BROUGHT ON BY DAMAGE CREDIT. WAGE GARNISHMENT OR CAR REPOSSESSIONS. THE ISSUES OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION IS CENTRAL TO THE WELL BEING AND SUSTAINABILITY OF FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. GIVEN WHAT IS OR IS NOT HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN CALIFORNIA AND FINING OUR OWN WAYS TO LOOK OUT FOR CONSUMERS. I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S HEARING AND HOPE THAT IT BRINGS THE MUCH NEEDED ATTENTION TO THESE ISSUES. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME UP. OUR FIRST WITNESS WHICH IS MISTER RICHARD CORDRAY FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CFPB MON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR INVITING TO TESTIFY MEET BE TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS RICHARD CORDRAY AND I HAD THE HONOR TO SERVE AS THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE U. S. CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. FOR ITS FIRST SIX YEARS. MY TESTIMONY CONCERNS HOW CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET PLACE. AT A TIME WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RETREATING FROM THIS AREA. IT WILL TOUCH ON THEORIES OF FINANCIAL REGULATION THE PURPOSE ROLE IN CURRENT STATUS OF THE CFPB. HOW FEDERALISM AFFECTS CONSUMER FINANCE AND THE RATIONALE FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP UP AND ENHANCE ITS OWN CAPABILITY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS? CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS PRIDED ITSELF ON BEING A LEADER IN LOOKING OUT FOR ITS PEOPLE AND HAS A CHANCE TO DO SO AGAIN HERE. FINANCIAL REGULATION IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO OFTEN FEEL FRUSTRATED OR MISTREATED IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET PLACE THE PROBLEMS THEY FACE AT A PERSONAL LEVEL ARE MAGNIFIED THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY. THE LAST TWO GENERATIONS HAVE SEEN AN EXPLOSION OF CONSUMER DEBT WHICH IS RISEN FROM ABOUT ONE THOUSAND PER PERSON THAN. TO MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON TODAY. THE MASS AVAILABILITY CONSUMER CREDIT HAS CREATED NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THAT. BUT IT ALSO INCREASES THE RISKS THEY FACE AND THE RISKS TO OUR ECONOMY. EXOTIC LENDING IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET BROUGHT DOWN THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT COSTING MILLIONS OF JOBS MILLIONS OF HOMES AND TRILLIONS IN LOST RETIREMENT SAVINGS. THE REGULATORS LACK THE TOOLS TO MONITOR THE CONSUMER MARKETS EFFECTIVELY AND MISSED THE TELL% TALE SIGNS. IN THE END THEY WERE TOO LATE TO STOP THE FINANCIAL CRISIS FROM TURNING INTO THE GREAT RECESSION. IN THE WAKE OF THAT CATASTROPHE WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE WORLDWIDE IN SCOPE THE COURSE OF EXPERTS CALLED FOR AN OVERHAUL OF FINANCIAL REGULATION. THEY CONVERGED ON THE TWIN PEAKS THEORY WHICH HAS BEEN BROADLY ACCEPTED IS THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. IT OPPOSES DISTINCT SEPARATION FROM BETWEEN THE FIRST PEAK OF FINANCIAL STABILITY. WERE POTENTIAL REGULATORS ASSURE THE STABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANIES THEMSELVES. AND THE SECOND PEAK OF FINANCIAL CONDUCT WHERE OTHER REGULATORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION. THIS APPROACH CREATES EFFICIENCY BY HAVING THE SAME REGULATOR OVERSEE THE CONDUCT OF BOTH CHARTERED BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES WHICH OFTEN COMPETE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE SAME MARKETS SUCH AS MORTGAGE. AN AUTO LENDING. THE SEPARATION THE TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT ONE OF THESE GOALS FROM SUBORDINATING THE OTHER. IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY MODEL THE MISSING FOCUS WAS CONSUMER PROTECTION. WE NEGLECTED -- OVERSIGHT OF THE CONDUCT THE FINANCIAL COMPANIES AND IT COST ALL THIS DEARLY INCLUDING FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THE GREAT RECESSION ALSO BROUGHT IN A DEEP FISCAL CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEEN HEALED. IN THE PAST DECADE MOST LARGE WESTERN ECONOMIES HAVE ADOPTED THE TWIN PEAKS MODEL US TRILLION NEW ZEALAND THE UNITED STATES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE UNITED KINGDOM IRELAND SOUTH AFRICA OTHERS A PROGRESSING TOWARD THE SAME DESTINATION. BUT RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA STILL OPERATING ON THE OBSOLETE MODEL WITH ITS BUILDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN PROMOTING THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF FINANCIAL COMPANIES. VERSES REGULATING HOW THEY TREAT CONSUMERS. THE TWO GOALS ARE SOMETIMES AT ODDS AND THE FINANCIAL REGULATOR DEPENDS IN PART FOR ITS FUNDING ON DUES PAID BY THESE COMPANIES. THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR STATUS IMPORTANCE CALIFORNIA WHICH NOW BOASTS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. FOR THESE REASONS CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE A MODERNIZE STRUCTURE WITH A MORE CONCENTRATED FOCUS ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE CFPB WAS CREATED TO FULFILL THIS ROLE. IN LESS THAN A DECADE IT'S PROVED TO BE A GREAT SUCCESS. AS THE CHAIRPERSON AND NOTED IN HIS AMPLIFIED THE VOICES OF CONSUMERS RECEIVING AND HANDLING OVER ONE POINT SIX MAIN COMPLAINT SINCE IT OPENED STORES. IT'S ENFORCED THE LAW VIGOROUSLY RETURNING NOW TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION AMERICANS WHICH WORKS OUT TO ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIANS ALONE. ITS REFORMS THE MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD MARKETS HAVE SAVE CONSUMERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR. PUTTING A HALT THE IRRESPONSIBLE AND PREDATORY LENDING THAT BROUGHT ON THE FINANCIAL CRISIS DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMY AND HURT SO MANY AMERICANS. IT ALSO HAS REIGNED IN HER DRESSING DEBT COLLECTORS FORCED IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CREDIT REPORTING COMPANIES AND STOP MANY SLOPPY OR ABUSIVE PRACTICES BY OTHER LENDERS AND STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS. RIGHT NOW THE CFPB HAS BEEN RETREATING FROM SOME OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER ITS NEW LEADERSHIP. IS BACKED AWAY FROM A STRONG FEDERAL AND PAYDAY LENDING. FROM ACTIONS TO PREVENT MILD VIOLATIONS OF THE MILITARY LENDING ACT AND FROM AGGRESSIVE OVERSIGHT OF STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS. I'M A WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THESE ISSUES FROM OTHER PANELISTS WHO ARE EXPERT IN THESE AREAS AND WE DISCUSS THEM IN MORE DETAIL. BUT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP FORWARD TO SHORE UP CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION. EVEN AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON IS CURRENTLY DEFAULTING AND SOME OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW. THE FINANCIAL FOR FORM WHAT THE CREATED THE CFPB NOTICE THE DODD FRANK ACT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR MORE EXPANSIVE PROTECTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL. THEY CAN GO BEYOND FEDERAL PROTECTIONS. TO PUT IT SIMPLY THE LAW CLEARLY SAYS THAT FEDERAL LAW SETS A FLOOR AND NOT A CEILING ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION IN THIS COUNTRY. CONGRESS THUS OPENED THE DOOR FOR MORE VIGOROUS PROTECTION OF CONSUMER RIGHTS THE STATE OFFICIALS WHO CAN INSURE THAT THESE LAWS ARE STRONG AND THE THIRD FORCED EFFECTIVELY. THESE EFFORTS NOT ONLY PROTECT CONSUMERS WHO SIMPLY DESERVE TO BE TREATED FAIRLY BY FINANCIAL COMPANIES. BUT IT ALSO IN THIS IS IMPORTANT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD BY PROTECTING MORE ETHICAL COMPANIES FROM HAVING TO COMPETE AGAINST BAD ACTORS THAT ARE WILLING TO CUT CORNERS AND VIOLATE THE LAW. TO GET AN ADVANTAGE IN THE MARKET. THAT IS THE WORST FORM OF UNFAIR COMPETITION AND STRONGER ENFORCEMENT OF CONSUMER LAWS CAN HELP ROUTED OUT. WE ALSO NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES A MORE COMPLICATED CREDIT PRODUCTS. OVER THE PAST DECADE MANY CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE HAZARDS OF MORTGAGE INSTRUMENTS WITH INCREASINGLY EXOTIC FEATURES. WE NOW HAVE ACCESS TO REVOLVING CREDIT OFTEN IN MULTIPLE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS WITH DIFFERENT INTEREST RATES IN VASTLY DIFFERENT TERMS. AND THEY MAY BE JUGGLING VARIOUS OTHER CREDIT APPLICATIONS AS WELL. YET NOBODY WOULD CLAIM THAT THIS COUNTRY OR THIS STATE IS SUDDENLY DOING A BETTER JOB OF EDUCATING CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR OBLIGATIONS NOT IN THE HOME. NOT IN SCHOOL NOT AT ORK AND NOWHERE ELSE. THAT'S A TASK WE NEED TO TAKE MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY THAN WE NOW DO OR HAVE DONE. BY TAKING THE INITIATIVE CALIFORNIA TO HELP LEAD OTHER STATES FORWARD. THIS WORK MATTERS GREATLY IN OUR SOCIETY WHICH IS MARKED RIGHT NOW BY GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY AND HUGE WEALTH INEQUALITY. THE FOCUS ON PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO PEOPLE'S POCKETS SHOULD BE MATCHED BY A SIMILAR FOCUS ON KEEPING MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS. RATHER THAN HAVING IT DRAIN AWAY A NICKEL AND DIME FEES FRAUDS AND SCAMS WERE ABUSES THAT MAY BE PERPETRATED BY BIG FINANCIAL COMPANIES. IN A SIMPLER ERA BEEN FRANK FRANKLIN DECLARED AS POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC THAT A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED. IN TODAY'S WORLD A PENNY SAVED FROM FINANCIAL PREDATORS IS A PENNY THAT IS VERY WELL EARNED INDY. A SINGLE BAD FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE CAN RUIN A PERSON OR FAMILY AND A CONSTELLATION OF BAD EXPERIENCES CAN UNDERMINE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES AS WE SAW IN THE RUN UP TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. JUST A DECADE AGO. IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO PRESIDENT KENNEDY GAVE A SPEECH TO CONGRESS IN WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SPOKE DIRECTLY ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE CONSUMER IN OUR SOCIETY. HE NOTED THAT THIS IS A QUOTE CONSUMERS BY DEFINITION INCLUDE US ALL. THEY'RE THE LARGEST ECONOMIC GROUP IN THE ECONOMY. TWO THIRDS OF ALL SPENDING IN THE ECONOMY IS BY CONSUMERS. BUT THEY'RE THE ONLY IMPORTANT GROUP IN THE ECONOMY WHO ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY ORGANIZED WHOSE VIEWS ARE OFTEN NOT HEARD. HIS WORDS ARE JUST AS TRUE TODAY. THE PUSH TO PROTECT CONSUMERS LATER RESULTED IN SUCH LANDMARK BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION IS THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT AND THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT. ENACTED UNDER BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS. THIRTY YEARS LATER THESE EFFORTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAD FALLEN BEHIND THE RAPID PACE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET PLACE. THE LAW IS NEEDED TO BE UPDATED AND AN OUTMODED REGULATORY STRUCTURE MEANT THAT THE LAWS WERE BEING SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER ENFORCED WITH GRAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ALL AMERICANS. THE CFPB WAS AN ESSENTIAL AND WELCOME CENTER PIECE OF THESE REFORMS. AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW AGAIN SEEMS TO BE ADVOCATING ITS ROLE IT'S CRUCIAL FOR THIS COUNTRY THAT THE STATE TO TAKING UP THE MANTLE OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION. I'M ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT CALIFORNIA IS PREPARED TO LEAD THE WAY. THANK YOU I'D BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CORDRAY. MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CORDRAY AND I ALSO MERCED PRECIADO BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE OVER THE YEARS AS WE'VE BEEN. STRUGGLING WITH STUDENT LOANS TO MOST SERVICES AND I KNOW THAT SECTIONS COMING UP A LITTLE BIT. WHICH I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE AND APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT WHICH I BELIEVE IS TRUE THAT. CONGRESS MEANT TO SET THE FLOOR GIVING US SOME LATITUDE BUT OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE TRY TO TAKE THOSE STEPS. THAT PREEMPTION THE NOTION OF PREEMPTION GETS REYES WHAT IS THIS AS AN APPROPRIATE STATE STRUCTURE LOOK LIKE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE RIGHT CONVERSATIONS AROUND CONSUMER PROTECTION AND HAVE. AN APPROPRIATE. PROTECTION SCHEME REGULATORY SCHEME TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE THAT BOYS AND THAT WE PROVIDE THAT THAT BALANCE AND THAT PROTECTION. SO GOOD QUESTIONS IN THESE ARE I THINK THE KEY ISSUES WERE TALKING ABOUT FIRST. UP WHAT IS THE STATE STRUCTURE LOOK LIKE -- IT COULD TAKE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE FORMS I THINK AND AS I UNDERSTAND THE THE BILL THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW ITS PRELIMINARY AN AGNOSTIC AS TO EXACTLY. WHERE THIS WOULD BE LOCATED IN THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THAT? BUT THE KEY IS THAT THERE BE AN INDEPENDENCE OF REGULATION OF FINANCIAL CONDUCT HOW IT AFFECTS CONSUMERS PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AND REGULATION OF THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH WITH THE WITH THE REGULATORS FACING THE INSTITUTION OR FACING AWAY FROM THEM TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND THE TWO ARE SOMETIMES. IN HARMONY AND SOMETIMES AT ODDS AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A INDEPENDENCE OF A FINANCIAL REGULATOR THIS GOING TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AGAINST FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT THAT'S WHAT WE DID AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT'S WHAT'S BEING DONE IN MAY MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. AND NOTABLY A NUMBER OF THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE SMALLER ECONOMIES THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. STATE CALIFORNIA'S A SAID IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IF THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO FINANCIAL REGULATION IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR CALIFORNIA AND I ALSO THINK CALIFORNIA WOULD ESTABLISH LEADERSHIP AMONG THE STATE'S UP BUT AGAIN AS TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS OF EXACTLY WHERE THIS WOULD LANDED WHAT THE AUTHORITIES WOULD BE I THINK THAT THERE'S A PRIDE A DIFFERENT WAYS. THAT COULD BE PURSUED YOU'RE ALSO RIGHT TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION THERE WILL BE BATTLES AT TIMES OVER FEDERAL PREEMPTION. OF THAT MAY BE HAPPENING IN STUDENT LOANS AND STUDENT LOAN SERVICING WE WILL SEE. UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE DODD FRANK ACT SPOKE VERY CLEARLY ABOUT THIS IT SAID THAT THE STATES HAVE LATITUDE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. UP BEYOND WHAT FEDERAL LAW DOES IT ALSO GAVE STATES THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW WHICH WAS AN UNUSUAL PROVISION BUT IT. MADE VERY CLEAR THAT CONGRESS INTENDED NOT ONLY TO HAVE A STRONG PROTECTIONS IN THE LAW FOR CONSUMERS BUT THAT THEY BE STRONGLY ENFORCED ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND I THINK THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WOULD BE A MOMENT WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE BACKING AWAY FROM THIS AND THE STATE'S WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY. A PICK UP THE TORCH AND CARRY THE BALL AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE MOMENT WE'VE ARRIVED AT TODAY. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE UNDERSCORED EXACTLY THOSE POSITIONS AND WE HAVE HAD A VERY WILLING PARTNER IN DE VITO WHO TENDS TO BE THE REGULATORY AGE YOU HAVE. BY THAT THEN DEPENDS ON THE ADMINISTRATOR IT DEPENDS ON THAT STRUCTURE AND AND FOR US WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING PERHAPS THIS HAS BEEN A MISSING COMPONENT TO HAVE A CONSUMER FACING. ADVOCATE WHO HAS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF AUTHORITY. AND THAT RELATIONSHIP THAN WITH THE D. B. O. WITH WHAT WHATEVER THAT STRUCTURE IS. IS REALLY WHAT THE MODERN APPROACH IS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TO FIGURE OUT HERE SO THAT WE DON'T OVERLY BURDEN. ONE REGULATOR WITH ALL OF THE ABOVE OR CREATE CONFLICTS WITHIN THAT ORGANIZATION. BUT SET UP PROPRIOCEPTION ISMS AND AS CALIFORNIA HAS LED IN SOME OF THESE AREAS OTHER STATES ARE DEFINITELY FOLLOWING US. AND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BACKING AWAY FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THERE I THINK IT IS LED TO US SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION FOR US TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS A MEMBER WICKS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CARTER FOR COMING TODAY I HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE EARLY STAGES OF THE CREATION OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. WORKING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA -- AND LEGACY I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SELL YOUR WORK THERE -- YOU KNOW WITH THE THE CFPB FEDERALLY ANOTHER SORT OF THREE PROMISE EDUCATION FORSMAN RESEARCH COMPONENTS TO IT -- CAN YOU TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ANY LESSONS YOU LEARNED IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE REALLY PROTECTING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR -- MANY OF WHOM ARE DISPROPORTIONATE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- AND SOME IT FROM SOME OF THE SORT OF PREDATORY PRACTICES. SURE AND AND HAS GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND I'M SURE YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT -- AT THE TIME OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THE MILTON IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET. DEALT A HUGE BLOW. TO WEALTH ACCUMULATION BY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY YOU KNOW SOME SOME COMMUNITIES MORE OF THEIR WEALTH IS TIED UP IN BOND AND STOCK MARKETS SOME OF THEM IT'S TIED UP MORE AND HOUSING VALUES. AMONG COMMITTEES A COLOR MORE WEALTH TENDS TO BE TIED UP IN HOUSING VALUES AND SINCE WITH THE HOUSING MARKET THAT CRATERED AND PROPERTY VALUES DECLINED PRECIPITOUSLY IN SOME AREAS. OFTEN LEADING TO FOR CLOSURE TO THE PEOPLE ENTIRELY OUT LOST ALL OF THEIR EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES. AND THEN COULDN'T GET BACK IN BECAUSE WITH A FOR CLOSURE ON THE RECORD THEY COULDN'T GET CREDIT TO GET A NEW MORTGAGE IN AND BUY A NEW HOMES SO. THAT WAS A TREMENDOUS BLOW TO WEALTH INEQUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT GOES TO SHOW THE KIND OF CONSEQUENCES YOU KNOW IT ISN'T JUST WHETHER I GOT INTO A BAD LOAN. IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY COMMUNITY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IF THERE'S A NUMBER FOR CLOSURES BECAUSE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CAN AFFECT MY PROPERTY VALUES IT'S GOING TO PUT ME AT RISK. IF IT LEADS TO THE FREEZING UP THE CREDIT MARKETS IT'S GONNA COST BUSINESSES BEING ABLE TO OPERATE IN THERE FOR PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE HURT. BY THESE PROBLEMS AND HAVING. A MORE SECURE SYSTEM AND MORE SECURE APPROACH TO THIS IS IS BOUND TO NOT ONLY BENEFIT CONSUMERS. BUT THE BENEFIT OF THE ECONOMY. IN THE LONG RUN IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT -- ENDED UP HAVING TO DEAL WITH A HUGE FISCAL CRISIS AND LOTS OF FUNDING FOR LOTS OF THINGS GOT CUT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE. THE REVENUES IN THIS LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE ISSUES ARE OFTEN VERY FRAUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT HE WHAT WE FOUND IS MANY LOWER INCOME CONSUMERS ARE THE MOST CAREFUL ABOUT THEIR MONEY BECAUSE IT REALLY MATTERS THEIR LIVING ON THE EDGE ALL THE TIME. THE TRYING TO BE CAREFUL OF EVERY DOLLAR YET THEY CAN MAKE. UNFORTUNATE DECISIONS DECISIONS THEY COME TO REGRET. AND THEY ARE ALWAYS RUNNING INTO THE PROBLEM OF TOO MUCH MONTH NOT ENOUGH MY AND THE HIGH COST FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE -- LOW INCOME AND HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE USE OF THEIR MONEY WHETHER IT'S A CHECK CASHING OUTLETS FOR THE LIKE. MAGNIFIES THE PROBLEMS FOR THEM. WE STILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION THIS COUNTRY THAT IS UNBANKED AND IN ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT. LEAP IN LARGER GROUP THAT IS UNDER PAYING -- AND BEING ABLE TO REACH THEM WITH THE BEST A PRODUCTS MATTERS ENORMOUSLY SO THERE'S QUITE A BIT THAT CAN BE DONE THIS WAS ONE OF THE FOCUSES FOR THE CFPB WE HAD. AN OFFICE THAT DEALT WITH -- ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT A AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT COULD BE A FOCUS OF OF THIS ENTITY HERE OR UNITS ARE WHATEVER IT WOULD BE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE BANKING SUPERVISOR THE HEAD OF TPO. TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AND TO FOCUS ON CONSUMERS WHETHER ALSO TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE LICENSED ENTITIES IT'S REALLY TOO BIG A JOB WE WORKED WELL WITH HIM LET NO ONE WHO'S BEEN IN THAT POSITION FOR THE LAST NUMBER YEARS. ABOUT YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO DEPEND ON A PERSONALITY OR TEMPERAMENT OF THE ONE INDIVIDUAL. YOU WANT IT TO BE BUILT INTO THE STRUCTURE AND THAT ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT CONCEPT WHAT IS THAT SPECIFICALLY LOOK LIKE ON THE GROUND FOR THE USER. WELL IT LOOKS YOU MEAN WHAT IT WHAT DIFFERENCES MAKE IN THEIR LIFE YEAH YEAH JUST MORE SOME POTENTIAL EXAMPLE. WELL YOU KNOW IF IF SOMEBODY CAN BE ABLE TO GET A LITTLE BIT AHEAD AND BORROW AGAINST THEMSELVES RATHER THAN BORROWED A PAYDAY LOAN IT 210031004% INTEREST. IN A TOUGH PLACE YOU CAN BUILD A BETTER FINANCIAL FUTURE. IF THEY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES AND NOT HAVE TO PAY. SIGNIFICAN PREMIUMS EVERY TIME THEY WANT TO ACCESS TO MONEY A CHECK CASHING STORES OR OR ANOTHER PRODUCT PREPAID CARDS HAVE PROVEN TO BE A GOOD PRODUCT THAT IS. A NOW SAFER THE CFPB IF FACILITATED THAT BY PUTTING RULES IN PLACE THAT NOW PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO HOLD PREPAID CARDS WASN'T TRUE UNTIL JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT. EIGHT MORE OPPORTUNITY. YOU KNOW PREVENT THE EXPLOITATION OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING AT THE MARGIN AND GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO RISE WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS A MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MISTER CORDRAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY TESTIFYING AS WELL AS YOUR YEARS OF OF PUBLIC SERVICE. AND I I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING -- IN YOUR COMMENTS OPENING COMMENTS HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE ETHICAL COMPANIES VERSES THE BAD ACTORS. AND HOW THAT THAT CREATES AN UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD BUT THE INTERESTING PART OF THAT WAS YOU WERE ACTUALLY DRAWING A CONCLUSION OF ROOTING OUT THE BAD ACTORS BY USING. A CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AND FOCUSING ON TAKING CARE OF THE CONSUMER AND THAT WOULD HELP DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE ETHICAL VERSUS THE BAD ACTOR. WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU TODAY -- JUST AS A QUESTION AS YOU MOST LIKELY ARE AWARE OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING PUTTING UP 36% CAP RATE ON INSTALLMENT LOANS OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THE THE OPPOSITION THE CONVERSATION FROM OPPOSITION HAS REALLY BEEN AROUND -- CONSUMER PROTECTION VERSES ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND WHAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS AS FAR AS DURING YOUR TIME AT SEA -- CFPB -- IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS HOW DID YOU WORK TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING ACCESS TO CAPITAL. YEAH IT'S IT'S A GREAT QUESTION OUT OF TRINITY GOING TO LONG AND MY ANSWER IF I DO JUST JUST LET ME KNOW THAT. I'VE WORN OUT YOUR PATIENTS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THIS IS THE DILEMMA IN TERMS OF SPEAKING TO SHORT TERM LOANS ARE RATHER CREDIT MARKETS AS WELL. IS BETWEEN PROTECTING THE CONSUMER IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO CREDIT. USUALLY THE TWO CAN BE HARMONIZED PRETTY WELL -- IN TERMS OF THE SHORT TERM LENDING MARKET. WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT SOME OF THE PRODUCTS WE THOUGHT WERE QUITE EXPLOITATIVE I MEAN? PEOPLE LIVING THEIR LIVES OFF OF NOT A RECIPE FOR A SOUND FINANCIAL FUTURE. MOST PEOPLE GET INTO THOSE LOANS THINKING THEY'RE GOING TO GET INTO A SHORT TERM LOAN AND GET OUT OF IT AGAIN. BUT MANY OF THEM GET STOCK THE END UP PAYING FEE AFTER FEE THERE NEVER ABLE TO REALLY PAY DOWN THE PRINCIPAL THEY WILL END UP OFTEN DEFAULTING. DRIVING THEMSELVES INTO BANKRUPTCY HAVING PAID OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS -- AND IT'S IT'S REALLY A A MODEL THAT AIMED AT THE CONSUMER WHO IS NOT ABLE TO REPAY THE LOAN WHICH IS NOT A NORMAL TYPE OF LENDING NORMALLY A LENDER WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE BORROWER CAN REPAY THE LOAN BEFORE THEY MAKE THE LA. BUT IF YOU CAN FIND A MODEL WHERE YOU CAN MAKE ENOUGH MONEY OFF OF THAT BORROWER WE DON'T HAVE TO CARE IN THE END WHETHER THE EVEN REPAY THEIR LOAN. THAT TO ME IS A BROKEN MARKET AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE APPROACH THAT BY ADOPTING AN INABILITY TO REPAIR A RULE THAT IT BEFORE MAKING A SHORT TERM LOAN YOU HAD TO ASSESS. REASONABLY ASSESS IN A SHORTHAND WAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO THE SAME UNDERWRITING FURS FOR SHORT TERM LOAN -- THAT THE PERSON HAD THE REASONABLE ABILITY TO REPAY THAT LOAN -- WHEN IT CAME DUE? OUT WE DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL UNDER OUR LAW TO IMPOSE A RATE CAPS. THAT'S WHAT MANY STATES HAVE DONE IN FACT BY THE WAY AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW. STATES TYPICALLY HAVE HAD RATE CAPS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND IT WAS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THEY ALLOWED EXCEPTIONS TO THE RATE CAPS THAT FACILITATED A PAYDAY LENDING INDUSTRY. AND MANY STATES NEVER. NEVER WENT THAT DIRECTION OR HAVE REVERTED BACK TO IT. AND IT'S ABOUT NINETY MILLION AMERICANS LIVE IN STATES WITH IS PEOPLE. SEEM TO GET ALONG JUST FINE THEY'RE NOT WORSE OFF THAN ELSEWHERE -- AND THERE'S LOTS OF ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE TO FIND THEM -- AND I THINK THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE IN CALIFORNIA -- SO AGAIN ACCESS TO CREDIT IS IMPORTANT BUT IT SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE CREDIT. AND IF IT'S CREDIT IT'S PREDATORY AND IT'S GONNA DRIVE PEOPLE INTO OUT WORSE FINANCIAL SITUATIONS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON THE PROTECTIONS. THANK YOU [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR OF THE THING I THANK YOU MISTER NOW CADRE -- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE CONSUMERS TO HAVE -- FOR FINANCIAL LAW NOW PROTECTION REGULATIONS AND IS -- OF VERY IMPORTANT TO AMONG MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT -- YOU STRONGLY AGREE WITH YOUR STATEMENT THAT THE WE NEED. TO EDUCATE THE BETTER EDGEMONT BETTER JOB OF EDUCATING CONSUMERS WHAT THEY ARE GETTING INTO. BUT SOMETIMES I GUESS I THEY HAVE NO CHOICE TO ONCE THEY GET INTO AND THEY CANNOT MEET THE OBLIGATIONS SO THAT'S WHY. NOW YOU CAN -- CLASSIFIED AD LENDERS AND THE GOOD TO THEM THERE SO. IN THE BED COMPLAINTS OF BUT YEAH THAT COMPANIES ETCETERA -- SO IS A MATTER OF I THINK -- I'M MAKING. RESOURCES SO MORE CHOICES. AVAILABLE FOR THE CONSUMER SO SO THAT THEY CAN -- HAVE A BETTER. MALL COMPARISON SHOPPING RATHER THAN HAVING FOR HIM. LIMITED TO TO A SUDDEN BAD COMPANY SYSTEMS SPEAKER. SO THE US -- IN ON MY A A FEEDBACK CUT TO THAT. I'M WONDERING -- YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OF CURRENTLY IS THAT THE FOURTEEN IN -- REGULATING -- THE SOME OF THE OBLIGATIONS SO. UNDER FEDERAL LAW IS THAT THE FED THE WORST JOB WHY ARE IS THAT THE AGENCY IS SO IN THE STATE THAT WE NEED. TO REGULATE. AND THE IF YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME SPECIFIC XAMPLES OF WHAT THE IN THE AREA SO. INSTANCES SAID THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS AT THE FOURTEEN IN REGULATING THEIR LAW OKAY OKAY GOOD AND BY THE WAY I I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK MORE CONSUMER CHOICE IS GENERALLY GOOD. ALTHOUGH IF THAT CHOICE CROSSES THE BOUNDS INTO THE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT AND EXPLOITATIVE AS WE SAW SOME OF THE EXOTIC MORTGAGE MORTGAGE PRODUCTS LEADING UP THE CRISIS THEN -- IT IT IT CROSSES THE LINE AND IT NEEDS TO BE RAINED OUT BACK IN. IN TERMS OF WHERE OF THIS THE STATE COULD BE STEPPING UP FIRST OF ALL UNDER UNDER THE DODD FRANK ACT INTERESTINGLY IN THIS IS NOT THE NORMAL. APPROACH IT SPECIFIED THAT STATE OFFICIALS HAD THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW THEY SEEM TO BE QUITE CONCERNED THAT FEDERAL LAW WOULD BE SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER ENFORCED AND THEY WANTED TO BRING MORE. TEAMMATES TO THE TO THE JOB OF MAKING SURE FEDERAL LAW WAS ENFORCED SO CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW. TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE IN CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION SO THAT'S ONE PIECE -- ALSO IT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PASS ITS OWN LOS. AREAS WHERE I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PULLING BACK I'M MENTIONED A FEW OF IN MY TESTIMONY. I THINK THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN -- NOT BEEN -- EXERTING THE PROPER OVERSIGHT OVER STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS WHO ARE CAUSING ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. I THINK THAT THEY'RE WALKING BACK FROM THE PAYDAY LENDING RULE WHICH WOULD HAVE IMPOSED A REASONABLE. MODEST -- PUBLICATION ON LENDERS TO ASSESS THE REBEL BILLETED REPAIR OF THE POWER BEFORE MAKING THE LOAN -- AND THEY HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM PREVENTIVE REGULATION UNDER THE MILITARY LENDING ACT WHICH WHICH AGAIN IS MEANT TO PROTECT OUR SERVICE MEMBERS IN OF VULNERABLE POPULATION WHO. IF THEY'RE DEPLOYED IN OVERSEAS. HE REALLY THEY REALLY CAN'T BE MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS BACK HOME VERY WELL AND SO WITH THE CONGRESS VERY SENSIBLY IMPOSED A LIMIT. ON THE INTEREST RATE THAT COULD BE CHARGED ON PRODUCTS TO THE MILITARY AS A WAY OF PROTECTING THEM AND SIMPLIFYING THEIR LIVES SO THEY CAN FOCUS ON DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS -- RISKING THEIR LIVES TO DEFEND ALL OF US SO. THESE ARE AREAS WHERE THEY WALKED BACK I DON'T KNOW WHAT AREAS FURTHER IS THEY MAY WALK BACK FROM. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR STATES TO STEP UP IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN IS THE LARGEST ECONOMY THE LARGEST STATE IN THE NATION AND A REAL LEADER WHOSE EXAMPLE WOULD MATTER TO OTHER STATES AND BRING THEM ALONG I THINK. AS YOU INDICATED THOSE OTHER AREAS -- THAT THE WE SEE YOU SEE THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE OF CLOSELY MONITORED THE AND IN CALIFORNIA WHICH AGENCY IS SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE TO WILL MONITOR. AND ENFORCE THE LAW. WELL AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S THERE'S TWO POSSIBILITIES HERE ONE IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND ONE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT -- WE WORKED WELL WITH BOTH -- THE CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL A AND WHEN HE WAS IN CONGRESS BEFORE THAT AND ALSO -- THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT BUT I THINK IT DOES MATTER IF THE STRUCTURE -- SECURES THIS PROTECTION AND IT DOESN'T DEPEND ONLY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND ALSO THERE CAN BE SUCH A THING AS TOO MANY JOBS BEING GIVEN TO ONE INDIVIDUAL. TO OVERSEE THE LICENSING AND THEN THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FINANCIAL COMPANIES AND THERE'S THOUSANDS OF THEM. AND THEN ALSO TO BE EXPECTED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE RIGHT FOCUS ON THAT AND THAT'S WHY AROUND THE WORLD OVER NOW OVER NOW COUNTRIES ARE SPLITTING THOSE TWO THINGS SO THAT EACH OF THEM. CAN HAVE SOMEBODY DEDICATED TO BEING -- WHOLLY FOCUSED ON THAT PARTICULAR JOB. MAYBE THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT THE SOME. IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE A IN A BETTER ENFORCEMENT. OKAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MISTER CORDRAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY THIS IS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT I'VE I'VE I'VE HAD TO MEET YOU SO IT'S A PLEASURE -- DID HAVE YOU SPEAKING WITH US TODAY I I'M% LOOKING THROUGH YOUR PURE PRINTED TESTIMONY. AND I SEE WHERE YOU SAY THAT IN LESS THAN. I THINK REFERRING TO YOUR LEADERSHIP AT CFPB THAT IN LESS THAN A DECADE ED PROVED TO BE A GREAT SUCCESS. AND THEN IT FURTHER GOES ON TO STATE THAT NOW YOU FEEL THAT -- CPB IS RETREATING FROM SOME OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES -- UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP SO IT SEEMS YOU ARE TRYING TO TO TO DRIVE VERY DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN THEIR ROLE IN THEIR SUCCESS AS WHEN YOU WERE THERE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT IS NOW IS THAT AN INCORRECT ASSUMPTION FOR ME TO ME YEAH ALTHOUGH. ALTHOUGH -- THAT'S A LITTLE OVERSTATED BECAUSE THE NUMBERS THAT THEY GAVE YOU HERE ARE NUMBERS THAT INCLUDE SOME WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE UNDER MY SUCCESSORS. SO THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS I THINK THE NUMBER WAS TWELVE BILLION. UNDER THE SIX YEARS THAT I WAS THERE IT'S NOW TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION SO THEY'VE TAKEN SOME ENFORCEMENT ACTION SINCE THEN THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETELY RETREATED -- THE NUMBER OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS HANDLED WAS ONE POINT THREE MILLION AT THE TIME I LEFT AND IT'S NOW UP OVER ONE POINT SIX PROBABLY ONE POINT SEVEN OR ONE POINT EIGHT SO THEY CONTINUE TO WORK IN THOSE AREAS. THEY HAVEN'T RETREATED ACROSS THE BOARD FROM EVERYTHING BUT THEY'VE RETREATED ON SOME KEY ISSUES AND I'M WORRIED THAT THEY MAY RETREAT SOME MORE BUT IN GENERAL YES THAT'S THE DISTINCTION I WAS. TRYING TO POSE WAS BETWEEN AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND WHAT I THINK HAVE HAVE BEEN -- SOMEWHAT SOMEWHAT -- LESS AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS CERTAINLY UNDER THE CRY THINK THEY WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THEMSELVES. OKAY WELL THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH OF AN ANSWER -- UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP WERE YOU -- I GUESS WERE YOU ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INVESTIGATE THE WELLS FARGO FRAUD THAT WAS TAKING PLACE. BUT WE WERE AND WE DID THAT THROUGH A TEAM EFFORT INCLUDING THE LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHO PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THAT -- AND WE HAD THE FEDERAL PARTNER THE OCC WHO WAS PART OF THAT AS WELL BUT YES WE WERE ABLE TO EXPOSE. WHAT WAS THE SIGNIFICANT SCANDAL AND ONE THAT STILL SHOCKS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN MILLIONS OF CREDIT CARD AND BANKING ACCOUNTS? OPEN BY EMPLOYEES OF WELLS FARGO. WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT OF CUSTOMERS I MEAN WHAT WE THINK ABOUT WHEN WE PUT OUR MONEY IN A BANK WE ASSUME THAT IT WILL BE KEPT SAFE THERE. THAT THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT THAT WE DON'T INTEND THEM TO DO AND THAT WILL KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR MONEY THAT'S THE KIND OF TRUST THAT THIS RELATIONS BUILD UPON. AND WELLS FARGO VIOLATED THAT TRUST VERY SEVERELY I THINK WHICH CAUSED ALL THE OUTRAGE. OKAY WELL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- CFPB WASN'T REALLY TERRIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN EXPOSING THAT PRIDE AND THAT WAS PART OF THE FAILURE OF THE DEPARTMENT IN GENERAL -- THERE YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THE I. G.'S OFFICE ADMONISHED TO SEE A P. B. ROUTINELY FOR GETTING IN THE WAY OF CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT -- SURE LIKE A COMMON IN BOTH OF THOSE THINGS WYOMING LINED I'D LIKE TO FINISH MY SENTENCE RUN YOU CAN CERTAINLY RESPOND I'D LOVE TO HEAR THE RESPONSES -- IN ADDITION I GUESS I'M I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND -- YOU'VE COME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY NEED TESTIFIED IN THE PAST -- BUT I FEEL AS THOUGH -- YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR AGENDA OUR ART ADAM. MORE POLITICALLY BIASED THEN -- THEY SHOULD BE IN YOU'VE COME HERE -- TO DRAW THE THE THE CLEAR LINE OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN -- YOUR POLITICS AND THE POLITICS THAT ARE CURRENTLY RESIDE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S TERRIBLY HELPFUL WE ALL I THINK ON THIS COMMITTEE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AND EXPLOITED. AND I MOST CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE HAD SOMEONE'S OUT THERE SOME PRODUCTS THAT WERE DEVASTATING -- TO MANY AMERICANS I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THERE BUT I I WORRY THAT YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY AND PERHAPS COMMENTS IN THE PAST -- ARE ARE ARE COMING FROM A PLACE INSIDE OF YOU THAT IS VERY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND REALLY THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO TODAY I KNOW THERE IS. SOME VERY SERIOUS SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS MADE AGAINST -- YOUR DEPARTMENT IN YOUR OFFICE I MEAN I KNOW THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAD SOME ISSUES WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT THERE'S JUST THIS CLOUD. I FEEL LIKE THAT -- YOU KNOW WHICH IS HANGING ABOVE YOU WHEN YOU COME IN HERE AND YOU START TO POINT FINGERS BACKWARDS -- INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE FUTURE AND WHAT THINGS -- CAN BE DONE AND WHAT WHAT SUCCESS IS THERE WERE IN THE PAST SO YOU'RE WELCOME TO COMMENT ON THERE'S I DON'T KNOW THAT WILL NECESSARILY AGREE -- BUT I JUST WANTED I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT -- BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY WERE EXPRESSED HERE TODAY AND THAT YOU KNEW -- CLEARLY BY NOW YOU'VE FIGURED OUT THAT I'M A REPUBLICAN -- BUT I KNOW THAT YOU HAD SOME DISPARAGING REMARKS TO MAKE. ABOUT REPUBLICANS IN THE PAST REFERENCES COMMENTS ABOUT **** THAT I KNOW YOU WALKED BACK BUT I THINK THAT. I NEVER AYE ONES ARE QUESTION HERE YEAH I'M WRAPPING UP MY COMMENTS. X. BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT. ON IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE WE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR POLITICAL BIAS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ACCOMPLISH THE SAME TAX WHICH IS. MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED. THANK YOU OKAY WELL WELL IF I MAY. I ALSO THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHETHER YOU'RE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT OR INDEPENDENT I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD MATTER. YOUR CONSUMER YOUR SOMEBODY WHO PARTICIPATES IN OUR ECONOMY AND YOU HAVE RIGHT TO BE TREATED FAIRLY LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULD BE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROTECTIONS ABOUT SO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT REALLY SHOULD NOT BE POLITICAL I'D WISH THAT IT WOULD NEVER BECOME POLITICAL IN WASHINGTON BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO. TRIED TO POLITICIZE IT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU REFERRED TO WERE ACTUALLY NOT TRUE THEY WERE PART OF THE POLITICAL THEATER THAT SURROUNDED. THE BEER AT TIMES WE NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS YOU SAID THAT WOULD THAT WOULD NOT -- WE DID COMPLY WITH CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT NOT ALWAYS TO THEIR SATISFACTION BUT WE PRODUCE THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS TO THEM -- AND AND CONSTANTLY SOUGHT TO RESPOND. TO THEIR DEMANDS. IN IN TERMS OF WHETHER -- I SAW THIS IS POLITICAL OR NOT I SAUCES TRYING TO WORK TO PROTECT CONSUMERS -- YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND AND YOUR FAMILY'S FAMILY AND EVERYBODY ELSE HERE AND THEIR FAMILIES FAMILY THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO. AND BY THE WAY WE RESPONDED TO LOTS AND LOTS OF COMPLAINTS THAT WERE FORWARDED TO US FROM THE OFFICES OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN AND AND DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN. DIDN'T MATTER TO US THEY WERE AMERICANS THEY WERE PEOPLE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SERVE AND WE WORK TO SERVE THEM. AND SO -- AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOME COMMON GROUND HERE AROUND HERE YOUR POINT WHICH I VERY MUCH AGREE WITH AND ACCEPT. THAT THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT PROTECTING PEOPLE ARE AND MAKING REASONABLE JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW BEST TO DO THAT AND I DO THINK AGAIN CALIFORNIA CAN BE A LEADER IN THAT. IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY FOR CALIFORNIA TO TO TAKE ON THAT ROLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NUMBER AT GRAYSON THEN CERVANTES. THANK YOU FOR REPEAT CHAIR AND MADAM CHAIR I I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING THAT. IS IMPORTANT TO WERE WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA AND THE PRESSURES. THAT WERE FACING -- IN THE STATE AS FAR AS THE SMALL DOLLAR LENDING AND THE TRIPLE DIGIT RATE. THAT -- IF -- IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WE HEAR THAT RATE CAPS WILL LEAD TO LESS ACCESS FOR PEOPLE AND THEN PUSH THEM INTO AN UNREGULATED INTERNET. TYPE ENVIRONMENT OR MARKET OF LENDING. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OR IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT WHAT DO YOU OR HOW DO YOU SEE CONSUMER CONSUMERS RESPONDING TO A RATE CAP AND HAVING A MORE ADVANTAGEOUS REGULATED MARKET. YEAH I THINK WE CAN AGAIN WE CAN LOOK UPON THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN STATES THEY HAVE A RATE CAP IT'S ABOUT NINETY MILLION AMERICANS -- AND PEOPLE IN THOSE STATES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE HIGH COST PAYDAY LOANS. AND THEY TEND TO DO WHETHER THINKS THEY CAN GET A PAYMENT PLANS FROM UTILITY COMPANIES THEY CAN GET. LOANS FROM CREDIT UNIONS WHICH FILL THE GAPS ENORMOUSLY IN THIS AREA AND COMMUNITY BANKS OFTEN WILL MAKE SUCH LOANS. THEY CAN USE CREDIT CARDS AND CREDIT CARD VANCE'S WHICH ARE NOT CHEAP BUT CONSIDERABLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A PAYDAY LOAN -- THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITY AND AND THAT CHURCH BASED OPTIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO OR GO TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THE UNREGULATED INTERNET IS REALLY NOT AN ANSWER BECAUSE IT IS ILLEGAL. FOR A COMPANY TO MAKE LOANS INTO A STATE WITH RATE CAPS IF THOSE LOANS VIOLATE THE RATE CAPS NOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO ENFORCE THAT. AGAINST OUT OF STATE OR EVEN INTERNATIONAL A COMPANIES MANY OF WHICH ARE FRAUDULENT TO THEIR CORE -- BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE LAW AS IT STANDS SO AGAIN THAT'S NOT AN EASY ISSUE -- BUT WHAT I WOULD -- RECOMMEND IS WE FOUND A LOT OF INSIGHT ON THOSE ISSUES FROM FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS FROM. MINISTERS AND PRIESTS AND NUNS AND RABBIS WHO HAD MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION COME TO THEM AND DESCRIBE THEIR EXPERIENCES. AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THAT INSIGHT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE DO COPE WITH THESE WITH THESE ISSUES AND THEY DO. BUT PUTTING THEM INTO THREE ENTERED 4% LOANS DOESN'T BUILT THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURE IT JUST DOESN'T THANK YOU. DECEMBER CERVANTES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND JOINING US IN THIS CONVERSATION FOR THE PAST DECADE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS pMEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE TARGETED BY PREDATORY LENDING UNTIL RECENTLY HAS BEEN UNDER THE MILITARY LENDING ACT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE REQUIRED SUPERVISORY. REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE C. F. P. P. B. CAN YOU SHARE WITH US THE RAMIFICATIONS OR IMPACTS THAT. ARE THIS HAS HAD TO SERVICE MEMBERS VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS A STATE TO ADDRESS IT. YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S A GREAT QUESTION IT'S A CONCERN CURRENTLY I THINK. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE THAT SERVICE MEMBERS ESPECIALLY ON SERVICE MEMBERS ARE TARGETED BY PREDATORY LENDERS. FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS MANY OF THEM ARE YOUNG THEIR WAY FROM HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME IF YOU. LOOK AT THE MAPPING OF WHERE LENDERS SET AROUND MILITARY BASES THEY CONGREGATE THERE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A GUARANTEED PAYCHECK FROM THE US GOVERNMENT SO THEY ARE RIPE TARGETS -- FOR ABUSE AND THAT'S I BELIEVE MY BIG PART OF WHY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT WAS PASSED WHICH CAPS THE RATE ON LOANS -- TO SERVICE MEMBERS -- THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA END UP DEPLOYING THERE'S A LOT OF TRAINING THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO THEM AND IF THEY END UP WITH SOME PROBLEM WITH THEIR KIDS SECURITY CLEARANCE HAS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS CAN LEAD THEM. TO THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE THING FOR US TO LOSE THAT SERVICE MEMBER AND HAVE TO TRAIN SOMEONE ALL OVER AGAIN TO GO INTO THEIR PLACE OR GOD FORBID THAT THEY BE DISTRACTED FROM THEIR DANGEROUS MISSION OVERSEAS BY TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING BACK HOME -- THAT -- THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THINKING THAT WENT INTO THE MILITARY LENDING ACT. NOW THE THE THE POINT YOU'RE RAISING IS THAT RIGHT NOW THIS ONE OF THE THINGS THE CFPB IS WALKING BACK. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE MILITARY LANDING ACT -- THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO USE PREVENTIVE MEASURES SUCH AS SUPERVISING ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH THE MILITARY LANDING ACT. I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE THEM USE THE PREVENTIVE SUPERVISORY MEASURES TO ROOT OUT THESE PROBLEMS RATHER THAN. PUTTING THE ONUS ON SERVICE MEMBERS TO HAVE TO COMPLAIN TO THEM ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY RUN INTO -- I'VE HEARD IT HEARD THE COMPARISON MADE TO PREVENTING OF FIRE RATHER THAN PULLING SOMEBODY OUT OF A FIRE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PULL SOMEBODY OUT OF A FIRE WHEN THEY'RE A SERVICE MEMBER WHO MAY BE SERVING OVERSEAS ARE IN A DANGEROUS OCCUPATION -- IMPORTANT TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY SO THE PREVENTIVE MEASURE THAT THEY SEE A BABY'S WALK BACK FROM I ACTUALLY THINK IS REALLY THE FIRST THING THEY SHOULD BE DOING HERE. AND I'M REALLY PUZZLED AS TO WHY -- THEY HAVE CHOSEN -- TO TO RETREAT FROM THAT ROLE I THINK IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] AT MR CORD RATE. YOU'VE GIVEN US AN OVERVIEW OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT THE CFPB WORKED ON SPECIFICALLY ARE THERE. AREAS THAT DESERVED HEIGHTENED AWARENESS FOR THE STATE. WELL I THINK THERE'S QUITE A FEW AREAS -- I DO THINK THAT STUDENT LOAN SERVICING IS AN AREA OF HEIGHTENED PORTS FOR THE STATE'S I THINK SMALL DOLLAR LENDING IS AN AREA OF HIGH IMPORTANCE FOR THE STATE'S. I THINK DEBT COLLECTION IS AN AREA OF HEIGHTENED IMPORTANCE FOR THE STATE'S. THERE'S SEVENTY MILLION AMERICANS AND IF YOU BREAK THAT DOWN FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S PROBABLY -- EIGHT OR TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO MIGHT HAVE A DEBT OUTSTANDING AND COLLECTION IN ANYTIME OR SUPPOSEDLY SOMETIMES THOSE ARE WRONG THEY ACTUALLY DON'T REALLY -- THAT DEBT WHERE THE NUMBER NUMBERS THAT ARE BEING QUOTED IN THEM ARE WRONG. AND YET THEY CAN BE SUBJECT TO A GREAT DEAL OF HARASSMENT MUCH OF WHICH IS AGAINST THE LAW BUT DEBT COLLECTORS ARE VERY -- AGGRESSIVE AT TIMES AND THEY WILL VIOLATE THE LINE OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR THEM SO I THINK THAT COLLECTIONS ANOTHER AREA WHERE THE STATE'S COULD DO MORE -- I THINK SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE MORTGAGE LAWS -- AT THE STATE LEVEL -- THE REAL ESTATE SETTLEMENT PRACTICES ACT IS VERY HIT OR MISS IN TERMS OF HOW WELL THAT'S ENFORCED. AT THE STATE LEVEL UP SO THERE'S THERE'S A VARIETY OF PLACES WHERE I THINK STATES. THAT COULD BE MORE BUT I THINK THAT. RATHER THAN ME TRYING TO GUESS AT WHAT THOSE ARE. IF YOU HAD A CALIFORNIA UNIT THAT WAS FOCUS VERY SPECIFIC ON THIS ISSUE AND THEY WERE HEARING FROM CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT KINDS OF PROBLEMS THEY WERE FACING IN THEIR LIVES. THEN I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE A VERY GOOD FINGER ON THE PULSE OF HOW THEY COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S LOOKING OUT FOR THEM. THANK YOU. NOW THERE'S A TOPIC WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT BUT A TOPIC THAT'S EMERGING -- EMERGING HERE IN. NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY IT ACROSS THE WORLD IN ITS FIN TECH -- CAN YOU. THINK YOU TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW STATE. CAN DEAL -- WITH THE EMERGING FINTECH SPACE -- PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THERE REALLY ARE NO LAWLER PRECEDENTS AROUND AND NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WHICH CAN BE VERY HELPFUL -- BUT CERTAINLY WE WE DON'T KNOW AT WHAT DIRECTION IT CAN OR WILL GO. YEAH I I WOULD SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES I'M NOT SURE WE EVER FELT WE FULLY FIGURED OUT -- CLEARLY WITH THE NEW INNOVATIVE PROVIDERS YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM SOME RUNNING ROOM TO SEE IF THEY CAN BUILD A BETTER MOUSE TRAP AND BETTER SERVE CONSUMERS. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO STIFLE INNOVATION. ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ALL HAVE TO GET LICENSES TO OPERATE AT SOME POINT IF THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY SERVE THE CONSUMER PUBLIC. AND IT GIVES YOU SOME ABILITY TO SUPERINTEND THEM AND SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE TRIED -- TO APPROACH THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL ABOUT REACH WHERE WE WOULD HAVE SESSIONS BACK AND FORTH AND WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE DOING -- WE TRIED TO FOCUS THEM ON CONSUMER FRIENDLY PRACTICES -- BUT YOU KNOW UNLESS SOMEBODY'S VIOLATING THE LAW THEY CAN SERVE CONSUMERS. RELATIVELY POORLY OR THEY CAN SERVE THEM WELL IT'S REALLY UP TO THEM TO COMPETE THAT WAY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET PLACE -- IF THEY'RE SERVING CONSUMERS BETTER THEY SHOULD BE DRAWING BUSINESS TO THEMSELVES THAT'S WHY I THINK. A PROGRESSIVE BANKING AN ETHICAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TEND TO WIN OUT IN THE LONG RUN. BUT IN THE SHORT RUN THEIR PRACTICES PEOPLE CAN ENGAGE IN THAT CAN GAIN SOME MARKET SHARE FOR TIME THEY PROBABLY WON'T WIN OUT THE LONG RUN. AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE REST THE MARKET FOLLOWS HIM IN A RACE TO THE BOTTOM THAT HAPPENED WITH MORTGAGE LENDING AND IT LED TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS -- BUT IN TERMS OF FINTECH -- I'VE SEEN A LOT OF FINTECH PROVIDERS THAT I THINK ARE CONSUMER FRIENDLY AND THEY ARE COMING UP WITH WAYS TO PROVIDE. MORE SPEED AND EASE AND CONVENIENCE FOR CONSUMERS. I WANT THEM TO HAVE SOME LATITUDE TO PURSUE THOSE THINGS AND SEE IF THEY CAN IMPROVE THE MARKET PLACE. ON THEIR OWN AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE OVERSHADOWED BY TOO MUCH OVERHANG OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS -- IF THEY'RE UNCLEAR OR IF THEY'RE CONFUSING UP BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE NOBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO WIN IN THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME. LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AS EVERYBODY ELSE THEY SHOULD BE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IN THINKING THROUGH I KNOW THAT YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL -- WHO HAD THE CAPACITY WORKING WITH BOTH RED AND BLUE STATES -- AND THEY'RE AT THIS AT WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM BEING IN THE IN THE SPACES THAT IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE -- THAT FINANCIAL SERVICES -- ARE ISSUES THAT IMPACT AS YOU SAID CONSUMERS -- AND THAT IS IT REALLY THE GOAL HERE AND HOW WE PROTECT CONSUMERS ON HOW WE ENSURE CONSUMERS -- ARE ABLE TO LIVE IN OUR STATE TO IN OUR IN OUR COUNTRY IN A WAY -- THROUGH FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THAT IS RESPONSIBLE IN A WAY THAT HELPS THEM GET TO THEIR GOAL AS OPPOSED TO INHIBITING THEM AND MAKING THE IMPACT OR CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THESE NEGATIVE PRODUCTS -- GREATER -- AND IN REALLY INHIBITS THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD AT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR YOUR FEEDBACK AN INSIGHT. OKAY I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE IN WHAT YOU JUST SAID I THINK ALL OF YOU SAID IN IN YOUR OWN WAYS THAT THAT CONSUMERS DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED AND IS NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE IT'S NOT A PERSONAL ISSUE. IT'S A MATTER OF FAIRNESS IN OUR SOCIETY SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT -- TO WE WILL HAVE A CHRIS PETERSEN FORMER SPECIAL ADVISER IN THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR. AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU WHO WILL TALK TO US ABOUT THE PAYDAY LENDING RURAL. THANK YOU CHRIS FOR BEING HERE WITH US. AND YOU ARE WELCOME TO BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. WELL THANK YOU CHAIR LEAVE ON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY -- MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER PETERSON I'M A I'M A LAW PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH IN SALT LAKE CITY -- BUT AND I ALSO -- AND AS A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA IN WASHINGTON DC -- FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS IT TOOK SOME TIME OFF FROM MY CAREER AND AND WORKED AT THE CFPB. PLANNED ON WORKING FOR A YEAR AND ADD UP SAYING FOR LONGER ORIGINALLY I WORKED IN THE OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT. WHICH IS THE OFFICE THAT ENFORCES THE LAW STARTS FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND SITES. BANKS OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR BREAKING THE RULES AND MY JOB WAS TO LEAVE THE ISSUE TEAMS THAT FOCUSED ON SMALL DOLLAR LOANS PAYDAY LOANS VEHICLE TITLE LOANS SIMILAR FORMS OF CREDIT AS WELL AS CHECKING ACCOUNTS. AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS SIR IS SIMILAR TYPES OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SO WAS NOT WITH THE LITIGATORS BUT I HELPED ADVISE THE ENFORCEMENT OFFICE ON HOW TO DESIGN THEIR LEGAL THEORIES AND CASES AND IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL. ON SUBJECTS OF INVESTIGATIONS THOUGH IN LATER ON IT MANAGED TO SOMEHOW CONVINCE DIRECTOR CORDRAY TO TO LET ME BE AN ADVISER TO HIM IN HIS FRONT OFFICE -- FOR A COUPLE YEARS AS WELL BUT I ALSO -- GOT SENT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND WORKED AT THE PENTAGON FOR A PERIOD OF TIME -- ADVISING THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ON THE MILITARY LENDING ACT. AND ASSISTING THEM IN -- WRITING THE REGULATIONS THAT IMPLEMENT THE NATIONAL USE WE LIMIT ON LOANS TO MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS -- AND WAS VERY PROUD OF THAT IT AND SEE THAT IS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY CAREER. WELL I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT PAYDAY LENDING TODAY AND SIMILAR KINDS OF CREDIT AND I'M GONNA START OUT WITH A LITTLE BIT HISTORY AND BACKGROUND ABOUT THE PAYDAY LENDING INDUSTRY. THAN A TALK ABOUT THE C. F. P. BEES WORK THEN LASTLY I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA MY TO TO TRY AND IMPROVE THAT MARKET PLACE. SO FIRST OFF ON HISTORY IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH TWO QUICK STATISTICS THAT I THINK WILL HELP SET THE TABLE AND HELP YOU UNDERSTAND. THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS IN THAT MARKET PLACE THE FIRST TO TO STICK IS THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF THE NEW YORK CITY LE COSA NOSTRA LOAN SHARKING SYNDICATES THE ORGANIZED CRIME FAMILIES AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR POWER IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. THEIR AVERAGE INTEREST RATES WERE TWO HUNDRED AND 50% VERY EXPENSIVE LOANS HISTORICALLY -- BUT THE SECOND STATISTIC IS THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON PAYDAY LOANS AT STOREFRONT LOCATIONS ALL ACROSS AMERICA. TODAY AND THAT AVERAGE INTEREST RATE IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND EXPENSIVE AS THE MOB CHARGED. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL FACT THAT'S HARD TO HIDE FROM NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE AISLE NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM. AND I THINK IT HISTORICALLY IF YOU GO BACK TO THE EARLIEST FOUNDATIONS OF OUR REPUBLIC ALL THIRTEEN ORIGINAL COLONIES YOU KNOW NEW YORK VIRGINIA SOUTH CAROLINA GEORGIA. THEY ALL HAD INTEREST RATE CAPS EVERY SIGNATORY TO THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND EVERY A DELEGATE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION RETURNED TO STATES THAT HAD INTEREST RATE CAPS. THEY WERE VERY LOW BY TODAY'S STANDARDS THEY RANGE FROM 5% TO UP AROUND NINE OR 10% 6% WAS THE NORM BACK THEN AT THE FOUNDING OF OUR REPUBLIC. FREEDOM BACK IF THE FOUNDING OF OUR REPUBLIC DID NOT MEAN THAT YOU COULD CHARGE ANY INTEREST RATE YOU WANT TO POOR PEOPLE BENJAMIN FRANKLIN GEORGE WASHINGTON THOMAS JEFFERSON. WAS TESTED IN TOLERATE THESE KIND OF LOANS THEY BANNED THEM OUT RIGHT WITH VERY LOW INTEREST RATE CAPS WELL AS TIME WENT ON ALL STATES HAD INTEREST RATE CAPS THROUGHOUT THE EARLY PERIOD OF THE REPUBLIC IN THE BEGINNING THE TWENTY CENTURY BE STARTED REFORM OUR CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. BY ALLOWING HIGHER INTEREST RATES IN WHAT WERE CALLED SPECIAL USE REALIZE AND THEY INCREASED INTEREST RATES TYPICALLY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SO BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TO AS HIGH AS 42% BUT 36% WAS. USUALLY SEEN AS THE UPPER BOUNDARY THROUGHOUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TWENTY CENTURY. SO THE GREATEST GENERATION SO CALLED GREATEST GENERATION THAT WENT AND SURVIVE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND FOUGHT THE SECOND WORLD WAR -- IN JAPAN GERMANY THEY ALL CAME HOME AND THEY HAD INTEREST RATE CAPS THE PROHIBITED. A PAYDAY LOANS VEHICLE TITLE LOANS BUT THEN LATER ON ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY YEARS AGO THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE A SMALL DOLLAR LANDINGS TO INDUSTRY A MERGE THAT SAID THEY WERE GONNA MAKE SHORT TERM LOANS BY HOLDING ON TO SOMEBODY'S THESE ARE JUST SHORT TERM LOANS. AND YOU JUST PAYING A FEE TO GET A HOLD ON TO THE CHECK IN ITS NOT REALLY ALONE ANYWAY YOU'RE JUST HOLDING ONTO A CASHING A CHECK. RETURNED OUT THAT THEY'RE NOT SHORT TERM LOANS EVERY STUDY THAT HAS EVER LOOKED AT IT INCLUDING BOTH INDUSTRY SPONSORED STUDIES ACADEMIC STUDIES AND ALSO EVENTUALLY THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU WHICH I HAD THE ABILITY TO GET MORE DATA ON THIS THAN. EVER BEFORE LITERALLY IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLANET FOUND THAT THESE LOANS ARE NOT SHORT TERM LOANS THAT IN FACT THEY GET ROLLED OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE AVERAGE BAR WERE ACTUALLY BARS ABOUT TEN TIMES PER YEAR. AND PAYS BACK NEARLY THE SAME AMOUNT JUSTIN INTEREST BEFORE THEY EVEN START MAKING A PROGRESS ON THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE. AND THE INTEREST RATES ON THESE LOANS ARE TRULY EXTRAORDINARY I WISH I COULD SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE SUFFERING THAT I'VE SEEN IN MY OWN WORK AS AN EXPERT WITNESS IN WORKING WITH CONSUMER RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE SINGLE MOMS THAT WEEP ON THE STAND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN'T PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO JUST MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THE TEACHERS THE POST OFFICE WORKERS THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET BUT ARE HAVING A HARDER TIME DOING IT BECAUSE WELL BUT BECAUSE THEIR SERVICING A LONG TERM 41005100% INTEREST RATE LOAN. HI BEASTLY THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT THE EMERGING SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AS MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE IS COMING BACK IN STUDY AFTER STUDY SUGGESTING THAT PAYDAY LOANS. ARE ON HEALTHY FOR YOU THE CAUSE STRESS THEY CAUSE ANXIETY IN FACT A UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO STORY A STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO. LOOKED AT SUICIDE DATA IN HOSPITALS WHERE IN COMPARED SUICIDE REPORTS WHERE IN IN LOCATIONS WHERE PEOPLE HAD ACCESS TO PAY LOANS AND PLACES WHERE THEY DIDN'T. AND THEY FOUND A SIGNIFICANT CAUSAL CORRELATION BETWEEN FIRST TIME PAYDAY LOAN USE AN ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. IT MAKES A LOT OF COMMON SENSE DOESN'T IT IF YOU'RE A SINGLE MOM MARKETS SUCTION WORKER AND YOU REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE IT THE ENDS MEET AT THAT THE END OF THE MONTH. IT'S EASY TO START FEELING HOPELESS AND TO GIVE UP AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO TOO MANY AMERICANS ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. LET ME TELL YOU NOW SECOND ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE C. F. P. BEES WORK ON CONSUMER ON ON A HIGH COST LANDING. INSTRUCTOR CORDRAY SAID. THE CFPB DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT IN STRAIGHT CAP CONGRESS DID NOT PROVIDE FOR THAT BUT WHAT IT DID SAY WAS THAT THE CFPB WAS LEGALLY ENTITLED TO IDENTIFY AND DEFINE AND PROHIBIT. UNFAIR DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE PRACTICES AND SO WHILE I WAS AT THE CFPB DIRECTOR CORDRAY LED AN EFFORT TO DO THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE OUTREACH AND STUDY OF PAYDAY LENDING IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE DID STUDY AFTER STUDY WE ACTED CONSULTATIONS WITH SMALL BUSINESSES WITH FAITH LEADERS WITH THE MILITARY WITH -- THE EXECUTIVES WITH TRADE ASSOCIATIONS FOR INDUSTRY WE HELD HEARINGS AND WE EVENTUALLY DID A NOTICE AND COMMENT RULEMAKING WERE OVER A MILLION AMERICANS WAITING EMPHATICALLY ABOUT THE VERY ISSUES NOT EVERYBODY AGREED BUT ULTIMATELY. UNDER DIRECTOR CORDRAY AS LEADERSHIP THE CFPB CAME UP WITH A COMPROMISE PROPOSAL IT'S A COMPLICATED REGULATION -- BUT AT ITS CORE IT HAS A SIMPLE IDEA AND THE IDEA IS THIS. IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST RATE LOAN YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK WHETHER NOT THAT BORROWER HAS THE ABILITY TO REPAY THE DEBT% INCLUDING THEIR OTHER PRE EXISTING OBLIGATIONS AND MAKE THEIR NECESSARY EXPENSES. I PERSONALLY HAVE NEVER BEEN THAT SATISFIED WITH THE REGULATION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WENT FAR ENOUGH I THINK THERE'S SOME LOOPHOLES AND I THINK THAT -- WE HAVE TIME TESTED LAWS THAT HAVE WORK BETTER BUT IT WAS I THINK A VERY REASONABLE PROPOSAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS A COMPROMISE PROPOSAL THAT ALLOW PAYDAY LENDING TO CONTINUE EXIST. BUT ALSO A WOOD BAT CHOIR PSALM. GUIDE RAILS TO TRY AND TEMPER SOME OF THE WORST EFFECTS WELL THE INDUSTRY IMMEDIATELY SU THE CFPB. GOTTEN JUNCTION AND AS SOON AS THE ADMINISTRATION CHANGED THEY'VE NOW DECIDED TO ROLL BACK THAT PROPOSAL BEFORE IT EVER LEAVES THE CRAB COMPLIANCE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE REQUIRED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THAT REGULATIONS NEVER TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY -- AT I'M NOT YOU. FOR FOR ME. I'M NOT I'M IT'S NOT A POLITICS FOR ME I DON'T REALLY CARE THAT MUCH FRANKLY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT PARTY'S OR WHATEVER. FOR ME IT'S BUT THE SUFFERING SINGLE MOMS THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE TODAY RIGHT NOW TRYING TO PAY BACK THEIR 5100% INTEREST RATE LOANS AND NOT MAKING IT TO THE END OF THE MONTH. AND THE COLLECTING THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR OTHER OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE OF THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT WORKING FOR THEM. WELL ALRIGHT SO THAT'S A A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CFPB IS WORK AND LAST I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA MY TO BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M FROM A FROM YOU TALK VERY CONSERVATIVE RED STATE. I GREW UP IN A CONSERVATIVE FAMILY ON MY ON MY MY ANCESTORS ALL YOU KNOW BRIGHT RED SCARLET REPUBLICANS. AND I GUESS I'M A REASONABLY CONSERVATIVE GUY AS WELL BUT I WILL SAY THAT GROWING UP OVER THE KNEE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS AND ACROSS THE DESERT. I ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO CALIFORNIA IS A BRIGHT AND SHINING LEADER. IN THE COUNTRY EIGHT YOU KNOW A IN UTAH WE'RE LIKE THAT KINDA. YOU KNOW DOOR KEY STEP BROTHER OF CALIFORNIA -- AND AND AND IT BUT BUT I LOOKED UP TO SAN FRANCISCO IN THE SACRAMENTO THE NEXT BIG METROPOLITAN AREA OVER IS LEADERS IN THIS IN IN TECHNOLOGY AND AND UNIVERSITIES IN IN THINKING AND CULTURE. BUT I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY BETTER THAN WE ARE -- YOUR CURRENT LAWS ARE A BIT OF A MASS -- THERE'D DISLOCATED THEIR COPIES THE COBBLED THEIR COMPROMISES -- YOU DON'T HAVE INTEREST RATE CAPS AT ALL AND LOANS ABOVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN YOUR PAYDAY LOANS ARE NEARLY AS BAD AS THEY ARE IN MY HOME STATE OF UTAH. I THINK THAT YOU ALL CAN DO BETTER AND I THINK YOU SHOULD DO BETTER AND YOUR DOCTOR CORDAY POINT OUT THAT YOU OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WELL YOU KNOW THE FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMIES JAPAN. AND THE SIX LARGEST ECONOMIES GERMANY AND THEY BOTH HAVE INTEREST RATE CAPS TRADITIONAL ONES THAT DON'T TOLERATE THIS KIND OF STUFF IN A PUT UP WITH THAT AND NEITHER OES. THE UNITED KINGDOM FRANCE SOUTH KOREA THEY DON'T. HAVE INTEREST RATE CAPS THAT PROHIBIT THIS KIND OF LENDING AND FOR THAT MATTER SO DOES NEW YORK. AND IT'S NOT JUST LIBERAL PLACES SO TO SOUTH DAKOTA WHICH IN THE LAST IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TWENTY SIXTEEN HAD A BALLOT INITIATIVE TO CAP INTEREST RATES OF 36% SAME PRICE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. AND BEAT PRESIDENT TRUMP BY TEN POINTS IN A SCARLET RED STATE. THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING SUPERMAJORITY SUPPORT IN AMERICA FOR HAVING TRADITIONAL OLD FASHION INTEREST RATE CAPS THE PROVIDE REASONABLE PROTECTIONS FOR OUR CITIZENS. AND IF YOU STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS. YOUR CONSTITUENTS WILL PROUD OF YOU THEY WILL IS MYERS YOU AND SO WILL LIE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WOW THERE WE GO AND WITH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON HAS A QUESTION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NOT JUST. WOW I'M OVERWHELMED AT THE TROPHY OF YOUR ADMIRATION. WHAT YOU? I'M ALMOST GIDDY ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU HAVE A PATH YOUR BILL YET. THANK YOU FOR YOUR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND REALLY YOU HAVE ACTUALLY THROWN ME OFF BY YOUR ADMIRATION. I I DO FIRST WHY NEED A CLARIFICATION FROM YOU AND THIS MAY BE MORE A FAULT OF MINE. YOU'RE YOU'RE USING THE TERM PAYDAY LOANS -- OFTEN AND I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT SMALL DOLLAR ARE YOU USING THAT SYNONYMOUSLY OR ARE ARE YOU PURPOSING TO ONLY FOCUS ON PAYDAY AND NOT SMALL DOLLAR. YOU THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO I WAS USING PAYDAY LOANS AND AN A COLLOQUIAL TERM USED IN MY EXPERIENCE. THE INDUSTRY THE SMALL DOLLAR LENDING INDUSTRY THEY'RE VERY PARTICULAR WHEN THEY TALK TO LEGISLATORS AND TO LAWYERS AND JUDGES ABOUT WHAT THE WORD PAYDAY LOAN MEANS BUT WHEN THEY TALK TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IT'S ALL THE SAME THING CORRECT IF YOU ADVERTISE ON THE INTERNET THEY'RE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU. A PAYDAY INSTALLMENT LOAN AND OPEN AND LINE OF CREDIT A LONGER DURATION SOME ALONE YOU CAN STRUCTURE WHAT I CALL A PAYDAY LOAN IN ABOUT THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS -- AND THEY'RE HAPPY I MEAN I REALLY CARED IN THE DATE THE KEY THING. IS TO FOLLOW THE MONEY IT'S THE INTEREST RATE AND YOU CAN PRETEND IT'S SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT'S NOT THAT'S THE REAL KEY. I APPRECIATE THAT AND NOW I'M READY TO OFFER MY ADMIRATION TO YOU -- IF YOU CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM. AND THAT IS -- THE DISCUSSION FROM MUCH OF MY CONCERN. IS HOW DO WE TAKE THE UNDERSERVED THAT HAVE BECOME VICTIMIZED. BY THIS PREDATORY LENDING HOW DO WE TAKE THIS. PARTICULAR PART OF OUR COMMUNITY AND LIFT THEM OUT OF POVERTY WHAT POLICY OR WHAT WHAT MOVE COULD WE MAKE CONSIDERATIONS WE COULD TAKE THAT COULD ACTUALLY FACILITATE. SOME TYPE OF A PROGRAM OR PLAN TO ACTUALLY LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY RATHER THAN BURY THEM DEEPER INTO IT -- WITH THESE WITH THIS FINANCIAL POLICY. WELL I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND LOOK I I THINK THE FIRST PLACE THAT USED TO START BY LIFTING UP IS JUST TAKING SOME OF THE TRAPS AWAY. YOU KNOW ONE OF THINGS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY IS WE ARE VERY TOLERANT OF TRAPS THAT SINK FAMILIES AND THAT'S WHAT THESE ARE THESE LOANS ARE THEY ARE DEATH TRAPS. AND THE TIME TESTED MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET THE LENDERS TO DETERMINE WHEN OUR PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY IT'S JUST LIMIT THE PRICES THEY CAN CHARGE TO A REASONABLE INTEREST RATE. YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN THE MILITARY LENDING ACT REGULATIONS. WE MANAGED TO DRAFT A REGULATION THAT CUTS A LINE ACROSS THE ENTIRE ECONOMY IN ALL OF THE CREDIT CARDS THAT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE. THOSE ARE STILL AVAILABLE THERE WERE NO ADD ROLES ARE KERNELS ARE GENERAL'S IT CAME YELLING AT IS THAT WAIT A MINUTE YOU TOOK AWAY MY CREDIT CARD. THERE'S STILL TONS OF CREDIT THAT'S OUT THERE -- I IF I COULD TO YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS MYTH OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE PAYDAY LOANS BUT THE TRUTH IS. EVERY CREDIT CARD IN AMERICA HAS A BUILT IN FREE PAYDAY LOAN IF YOU'RE NOT CARRYING A MONTHLY BALANCE THEN THERE'S A TWENTY ONE THREE DAY THREE WEEK -- GRACE PERIOD THAT IS THE SAME THING IS A PAYDAY LOAN AND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. OF COURSE THE PROMISE THE PEOPLE GET IN OVER THEIR HEAD. IN AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA START CARING A REVOLVING BALANCE AND THEN THEY START YOU KNOW GETTING FURTHER FURTHER BEHIND BUT THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM IS NOT DUMPING ANOTHER 4100% STRAIGHT LOAN ON THEM THE PROBLEM THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. IS TRYING TO DISCIPLINE YOURSELF PULL YOURSELF UP BY THE BOOTSTRAPS AND HAVE SOME OF THAT CALIFORNIA ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. SO. I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY AND I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT AN INTEREST RATE CAP IS THE ONLY THING. BUT I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE VERY MOST IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS. AS A MEMBER STONE. SO THAT PART OF THE SPEAKING OF TRAPS THAT WE FALL INTO HERE AND AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THE JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT DO IN FACT HAVE CAPS BECAUSE AS WE'VE TRIED TO PUT CAPS ON AND EVEN THE SAME. AS UNDER THE MILITARY LENDING ACT WE'RE TOLD. OMEGA. BY BLENDERS SMALL DOLLAR LENDERS PAYDAY LENDERS HOWEVER YOU WANT TO FRAME IT IT IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU DON'T DRAW THAT DISTINCTION. BECAUSE WE WE WE PARTS THOSE WORDS VERY CAREFULLY AROUND HERE UNFORTUNATELY. WE'RE TOLD THAT ALL MY GOSH THESE PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE AND THE POOREST AMONG OUR COMMUNITIES. WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND AND I YOUR ENTHUSIASM IN THIS NOTION OF SORT OF PULL YOURSELF UP BY THE BOOTSTRAPS BUT FOR MANY OF THE POOREST IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S NO ABILITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T SEE THE LIGHT THEY DON'T SEE THE ABILITY OUT OF IT. AND A LOT OF THEM ARE MAXED OUT ON THE CREDIT CARDS WHICH IS WHEN THEY BECOME VULNERABLE TO TODAY PAYDAY LENDERS. AND SO IF. A JURISDICTION LIKE NEW YORK AND PUT A CAP ON AND THEY OBVIOUSLY THERE POOREST HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. HOW IN THE WORLD DO THEY DO THAT? WHEN OBVIOUS WHEN WE'RE TOLD WE CAN'T DO THAT AND STILL GIVE THESE COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO CAPITAL? WHAT? FRANK FRANKLY I I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE SAID TO PAY LOANS I ALREADY MENTIONED CREDIT CARDS WHICH INCLUDES NOT JUST PRIME CREDIT CARDS BUT SUBPRIME CREDIT CARDS THERE ARE A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED WITH. BELT OF THE SMALL BALANCES WITH HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND SOME FEES MAY BE SECURITY DEPOSIT THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST CREDIT SCORES. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR CONSUMERS TO FIND OF THE HAVE TO SHOP A LITTLE BIT AND THEY HAVE TO APPLY BUT THOSE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE OTHER CREDIT CARDS MAXED OUT OR STRUGGLING. THERE ARE CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THESE SAME CALL EXTENSIVE POPULATIONS SECOND. THE FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS HAVE A PAYDAY ALTERNATIVE LOAN PROGRAM -- THAT HAS INTEREST RATES OF 28% PLUS AN APPLICATION FEE THESE ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE AT CREDIT UNIONS ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND NORMAL STATE LAWS DON'T APPLY DON'T BECAUSE TO SOME SPECIAL FEDERAL BANKING LAWS. AND THESE ARE AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO SEEK THEM OUT THEY DON'T ADVERTISE THEM BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A SUFFICIENT MARGIN IN A 28% SMALL DOLLAR LOAN TO BUY A LOT OF ADVERTISING OR OR. PURCHASE EXPENSIVE BRICK AND MORTAR STORE FRONT PROPERTY IN A MAJOR THOROUGHFARE OR BY ADVERTISING ONLINE A THIRD EXAMPLE FINANCE COMPANIES. WHICH HAVE SOME PRETTY ROUGH LOANS AND TO BE HONEST INSTALL LONGER DURATION STOP AT LUNCH BUT STILL HAVE INTEREST RATES OF ABOUT 36% OR LOWER VERY COMMON IN STATES LIKE NEW YORK NORTH CAROLINA AND OTHER STATES THAT PROHIBIT PAYDAY LENDING. FOURTH EXAMPLE ARE NEGOTIATED FORBEARANCE AGREEMENTS I THINK DIRECTOR CORDRAY MENTION THIS AS WELL ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE IN A FINANCIAL JAM. IS SPEND SOME TIME NEGOTIATING WITH YOUR VARIOUS CREDITORS WITHOUT YOUR LAN ORDER TO UTILITY COMPANY YOUR DENTIST WHOEVER IT IS BECAUSE THEY WILL OFTEN WORK WITH YOU AT MUCH LOWER PRICES THAN PAYDAY LENDERS DO. FIFTH ANSWER WOULD BE THERE ARE MANY IS SURPRISINGLY MANY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF EMERGENCY CREDIT THAT IT IS A VIABLE COME. CON COMPETITOR TO PAYDAY LOANS AND THESE IN YOUR STATE THIS WILL BE HARD AND SOME OTHER STATES BUT YOUR STATE IS VERY RICH IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE SOME EXAMPLES THE NOT PERSONAL FINANCIAL ADVICE. WEBSITE NERD WALLET DOT COM MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE LIST OF OVER A DOZEN A NONPROFIT -- BUT FAITH BASED COMMUNITY TYPE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW PROVIDING ALTERNATIVES TO PAYDAY LOANS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN SIX LAST. YOU KNOW I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF PAWN SHOPS THEY HAVE SOME ROUGH LOANS ARE SOME DRAWBACKS. BUT FRANKLY PAWN SHOPS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND HAVE BEEN THE CIVILIZED LENDER OF LAST RESORT -- TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHY BECAUSE IN A PAWN SHOP LOAN YOU PRE PLAN YOUR OWN EXIT STRATEGY FROM THE DEBT BY. TAKING SOME COLLATERAL WHETHER THAT'S AN ITEM OF JEWELRY ELECTRONICS AND PLEDGING SECURITY AND THEN IF YOU CAN'T PAY BACK THE LOAN YOU WALK AWAY FROM THE DEAD AND YOUR THE ONE THAT SHOWS WHAT YOUR EXIT STRATEGY WAS. YOU'RE ALSO FORCED TO DISCIPLINE YOURSELF BY MAYBE TAKING A LITTLE BIT SMALLER LOAN. AND BUY ALSO HAVING A LITTLE BIT THE PAIN UP FRONT NOT JUST ALL THE CANDY AND AND YOU KNOW FREE EASY MONEY UP FRONT. AND PAWN SHOPS EXIST EVERYWHERE THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND PAWN SHOPS THERE BALLOTS ACROSS AMERICA AND THEY PROVIDE A MUCH SAFER MORE REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE TO PAYDAY LOANS SO THAT'S ONLY SIX AM EXAMPLES BUT I THINK I'VE GONE ON TOO LONG SO TO STOP A PROBABLY. FAKE MORE AT LIVE CREATE THAT IN AND THEY THE DIFFICULT THING IS FOR US TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS TO GET CAPITAL. EVEN IF THERE ARE SOME BY CREATING AT A CAP LIKE THE 36% AND THEN THAT DOES NOT MAKE. CERTAIN OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE CAN LIVE THROUGH IT AND THE OTHER ASPECT THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND THAT WE GIVE CUT SHORT SHRIFT TO IS THIS NOTION OF FINANCIAL LITERACY. AND THE ABILITY AND THE WILLINGNESS TO ACROSS THE BOARD EDUCATE PEOPLE ON HOW BETTER TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES AND WE HAVE FOUND. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN WE DO THAT WE ALSO TAKE ADDITIONAL STRESSORS OUT OF THOSE FAMILIES AND THOSE COMMUNITIES AND OTHER. ABUSE NOT YOUR ISSUE BUT THINGS LIKE. CHILD ABUSE AND SPOUSAL ABUSE NEWS GO DOWN WHEN WE REMOVE THOSE PRESSURES AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHY CALIFORNIA PASSED AN EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. ADDING ON TO THE FEDERAL TO TRY AND PUT SOME MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST TO TAKE SOME OF THESE PRESSURES OFF. AND KEEP THEM AWAY FROM. THE LORD FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HER PERCENT LOANS WHICH WHICH REALLY ARE SHOCKING SHOULD BE SHOCKING BUT SEEM TO BE SOMETHING THAT WERE. WILLING TO TOLERATE UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM SO I IT I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ESPECIALLY THE VIEW THAT YOU HAVE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY OF MANY STATES AND AND WHERE THINGS OF WORK BECAUSE I AGREE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE ABILITY. THE PEOPLE THE COMPASSION AND WHETHER IT'S THE FACE BASED ORGANIZATION LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LOCAL CREDIT UNIONS WE HAVE A WIDE VARIETY. OF INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO COULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR. IF WE WERE WILLING TO DO THAT AND I KEEP HOPING THAT WE WILL FIND THAT ABILITY TO TO DO THAT SO BUT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU. AS A MEMBER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MISTER PETERSON I'M YOU MENTIONED SEVERAL OPTIONS -- THAT PEOPLE MIGHT TAKE TWO INSTEAD OF A PAYDAY LOAN OR INSTEAD OF A SHORT TERM LOAN. AND ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE WHETHER IT'S THE PAWN SHOP OR GOING TO YOUR IN LAWS ARE YOU KNOW THE VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MENTION. SO I'M. IF ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE AVAILABLE NOW WHY THEN ARE PEOPLE STILL GOING TO THE TYPES OF LENDERS THAT YOU IN YOUR FORMER BAATHISTS. SEEM TO BE SO ADAMANTLY OPPOSED. TO IT. ONE I THREE THREE POINT YOU KNOW IT YOU UNDERSTAND I'M SAYING HE'S BEEN THERE SO THEY'RE NOT USING IT AS MUCH AS THEY USING THIS OTHER TYPES OF LOANS. SO FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND THAT IS THREE THREE POINTS ONE IT'S IT'S NOT JUST ME AND MY FORMER BOSS. IT'S A SUPERMAJORITY OF ALL AMERICANS -- IN REPUBLICAN STATES AND DEMOCRATIC STATES ACROSS THE BOARD OUR ARE IN LOCK STEP ON THIS ISSUE BUT BUT SECOND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHAT WHY DO PEOPLE MAKE THESE CHOICES WELL FIRST OFF. BY HAD CHARGING A HIGHER INTEREST RATE. PAYDAY LENDERS VEHICLES HIGHLANDERS AND OTHER SIMILAR FORMS OF HIGH COST SMALL DOLLAR LENDERS HAVE MORE MARGIN IN THEIR LOANS TO MORE PROMINENTLY PLACED THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE AND MIGHT MAKE A BAD DECISION. SO THEY TAKE THEY THEY THEY BUY UP THE STORE THE MAJOR STOREFRONT LOCATIONS ALONG BIG THOROUGHFARES HAVE BIGGER SIGNS OUT THEIR ADVERTISING. YOU IN TERMS OF THE BRICK AND MORTAR STORES. MUCH MORE PROMINENTLY THAN SAY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION COULD AFFORD TO DO ON A PAY ALTERNATE ALONG WITH MUCH MUCH SMALLER INTEREST RATE THAT ALSO HAPPENS ONLINE TOO SO THE WAY THAT PAYDAY LOANS ARE MADE ONLINE IS PEOPLE WILL GO IN THOSE THE SEARCH ON YAHOO. BEING OR GOOGLE. AND FOR PAYDAY LOAN AND THEN A WHOLE HOST OF WEBSITES WILL POP UP IN THOSE WEBSITES ARE NOT USUALLY LANDERS WHAT THEY REALLY ARE OR TO CALL LEAD GENERATORS THAT TAKEN APPLICATIONS AND THENCE TURN AROUND AND SELL THAT APPLICATION. BUT THAT THAT THAT THAT LEAD IN A WHAT'S CALLED A REVERSE PAYING TREE AKTION. AND THE THE FIRST PERSON THE FIRST COMPANY THAT GETS THE BID ON THE LEAD. PAYS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT FOR FIRST LOOK LEAD AND IF YOU CHARGE 6100% INTEREST RATE YOU CAN BUY UP ALL THE LEADS FOR THE REASONABLE LOAN APPLICATIONS LONG BEFORE SOMEBODY EXCUSE ME THAT -- YOU KNOW HAS IS ONLY CHARGING 28% COULD EVER BY A POLICE AND SO THEY MANAGE TO DOMINATE THE MARKET NOT TO PRICE COMPETITION BUT THROUGH MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE SALIENT ADVERTISING AND MARKETING. AND MANY OF THE CONSUMERS IN THIS MY THE PLACE. DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PRICES MEAN DON'T REALLY READ THE CONTRACTS AND HAVE A HARD TIME IDENTIFYING WHICH COMPANIES ACTUALLY CHARGING A BETTER INTEREST RATE. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST REASON THE SECOND REASON IS THAT PEOPLE GET STUCK ON THESE LOANS AND I THINK IT OUT OF SO JUST KEEP ROLLING THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT'S AT 80% OPTION CALIFORNIA DOING REAL WELL. THE AYE AYE. I'M SORRY SHOULD ICE THE CHAIR OUR STATE [inaudible] SO OF I MEAN IT'S SO. THERE THERE ARE SOME RESTRICTIONS TO TRY TO PREVENT ROLLOVERS BUT IT WHEN THEY SEE IF HE BE LOOKED AT IT WE GOT DATA FROM ALL THE LENDERS BECAUSE WE COULD GET IT THROUGH OUR OUR SUPERVISORY EXAMS AND HAD TO TURN IT OVER. AND WE HAD OUR ECONOMISTS ARE STATISTICIANS LOOK AT ALL THE DATA AND CALIFORNIA BOTH PAYDAY LOANS AND VEHICLE THAILAND'S. THE ROOM OVER THE SAME PLACE SAME AS EVERYBODY ELSE -- THEY THAT BARBER'S AFTER THEY TAKE OUT A LOAN -- THE BILL TRYING HOPSCOTCH A MORE THOUGH IT MAYBE THEY'LL PAY IT BACK AND THEN TWO DAYS LATER THE COMING BY GET A NEW ONE OR THEY CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE MONTH AND THEY HAVE THE SAME. REPEATED USE PATTERNS THE DO EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. OKAY RIGHT I THINK YOU'RE CATEGORIZING IT AS A ROLL OVER LAND WHEN IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT IT'S SAME IN PRINCIPLE BUT OKAY SO -- WHEN YOU WERE ACT CFPB -- EVEN PRIOR TO BEING THERE. WERE YOU EVER ABLE -- TO I GUESS YOU KNOW THESE LINES ARE GOING AWAY -- AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT MANY OF THEM ARE. PREDATORY IN NATURE -- THANK YOU IS THERE I APPRECIATE THAT HERE HOW -- IS THERE ANY WAS THERE ANY EFFORT ON THE PART OF SEE IF YOU NEED. TO NEGOTIATE WITH BANKS TO GET THEM TO OFFER SOMETHING THAT WAS. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE ENTICING OR PEELING AND FINANCIALLY MORE RESPONSIBILITY CONSUMERS TO SORT OF YOU KNOW. CUT INTO THAT MARKET. WELL I THAT WAS NOT MY JOB I WOULD BEEN DELIGHTED TO DO THAT BUT I GOT THE TICKET WHERE BUT YEAH THE DEPARTMENT. I MEAN THAT'S PART OF THE THE THERE DEFINITELY WERE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WENT ON THAT ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING -- BET IT'S BEEN MY AND MY SENSE IS THAT THEY HAVE BORNE FRUIT AND AND SO YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE SUBPRIME CREDIT CARDS THAT HAVE A SECURITY DEPOSIT ON THEM. THOSE ARE VERY COMPETITIVE IN THE SAME MARKET PLACE FOR THE SAME OR VERY SIMILAR BORROWERS IT IS THE PAYDAY LOAN MARKET. AND WHAT I'M NOT WHEN WHEN MY LITTLE SISTER TO BORROW MONEY ON WHERE THE SUBPRIME CREDIT CARDS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY ROUGH LOANS IT -- BUT YOU KNOW. I MEAN THERE THERE ARE TEN TIMES CHEAPER THAN THAT AND YOU KNOW EVEN MODERATELY PRICED PAYDAY LOANS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME NASTY COLLECTION PRACTICES AND THAT'S IT SO THERE ARE BETTER BANK AND CREDIT UNION ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE -- THEY CAN'T ADVERTISERS AGGRESSIVELY CONSUMERS HAVE TO SHOP FOR THEM IN ADVANCE A LITTLE BIT MORE -- AND THEY'RE ALSO PROBABLY LITTLE MORE LIKELY TO CUT OFF THE CONSUMER A LITTLE BIT QUICKER THAN THE PAYDAY LENDERS ARE BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT CONSUMERS NEED SOMETIMES THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT NO YOU EAT YOU BORROW TOO MUCH YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY THIS BACK AND WHAT YOU NEED NOW IS SOME HELP FROM A CHARITY OF FAITH ORGANIZATION. BECAUSE YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD AND YOU'RE HEADED STRAIGHT TO BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY AND BORROWING MORE MONEY AT 4100% IS NOT GONNA HELP YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN YOUR PRESENTATION I THINK IT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND WE APPRECIATE THEM ALL THE FEEDBACK AND INSIGHT YOU'VE GIVEN US THANK YOU CHAIR APPLICATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION COMES AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. NEXT WE HAVE A SET FRONTMAN -- FORMER STUDENT LOAN -- THAT'S PERSON AT THE CFPB. THANK YOU SET FOR BEING HERE WITH US AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. CHAIRMAN LIMóN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HONOR OF TEST AT THE HONOR OF TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. THIS IS MY SECOND TIME TESTIFYING BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. I WAS LAST HERE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS CALIFORNIA BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST STATES IN THE COUNTRY TO TAKE THE CRITICAL STEP OF OVERSEEING THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET. BUT AS I SIT HERE TODAY THE SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CONSUMERS FACE ACROSS THIS STATE IN THIS COUNTRY LOOM LARGER. THE RISKS MORE SIGNIFICANT THE HARMS MORE SEVERE THE THREATS EVEN FROM THOSE SERVING IN POWER ARE TANGIBLE. AND WITH THAT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS STATE'S COLLECTIVE RESPONSE AND THE CENTRALITY OF THIS COMEDIAN THAT RESPONSE MORE CRITICAL THE DEEP SYSTEMIC REFORMS MORE NECESSARY. THE FINANCIAL FUTURES OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF CITIZENS ACROSS THIS STATE REST IN THE BALANCE. THERE IS PERHAPS NO BETTER DEMONSTRATION OF THIS PRECARIOUS POSITION IN THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS GOING ON RIGHT OUTSIDE THESE WALLS. BECAUSE I COULD THINK OF NO MORE APT EXAMPLE THAT CONVEYS THE URGENCY OF THE REQUISITE ACTION AND WHAT IS HAPPENED ACROSS THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET. IN JUST THESE PAST TWO YEARS. A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT DEBT HAS BEEN ADDED NATIONALLY. NOW BORROWERS COLLECTIVELY -- MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING LOANS. MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO TAKE ON STUDENT DEBT. NOW THERE ARE MORE THAN FORTY FOUR MILLION AMERICANS GETTING A STUDENT LOAN BILL EACH MONTH. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS HAD BEEN ADDED TO BORROWERS BALANCES NOW STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS -- ON AVERAGE MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT DEBT. AND IN THE LOOK INTO THE TWENTY FOUR MONTHS SINCE I WAS LAST HERE TWO MILLION BORROWERS HAVE DEFAULTED ON THEIR STUDENT LOANS. NOW EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE IN DEFAULT. AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE PICTURE IS EQUALLY BLEAK THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS -- MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. NEARLY HALF A MILLION OF THESE BORROWERS LIVE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THOSE BORROWERS ARE AT LEAST THREE PAYMENTS BEHIND OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS -- STUDENT LOAN DEBT. BY HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY THIS COMMITTEE HAS AGAIN TAKEN A CRUCIAL STEP IN RECOGNIZING THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN A CRISIS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BY HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY THIS COMMITTEE HAS RECOGNIZED ITS POWER TO HELP AND A POWERFUL COMBINATION OF CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK STUDENT LOAN SERVICING Là. COMBINED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S NEWLY INTRODUCED BORROWER BILL OF RIGHTS WILL RETOOL THE STATE'S OVERSIGHT OF THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS. BUT MORE THAN THAT IT CAN CREATE A ROADMAP FOR HOW GOVERNMENT OVERSEES ALL OF CONSUMER FINANCE. YOU CAN PROVIDE THE BROUGH BLUEPRINT FOR CALIFORNIA TO BUILD OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK THAT MATCHES THE COMPLEXITY AND THE FERRY IS MISS OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR THAT SEEMS TO KNOW NO BOUNDS. THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS ABOUT MORE THAN DEBT LOADS AND BALLOONING BALANCES. IS ABOUT MORE THAN HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY IN COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER FINANCE FINANCE ISSUE THREATENING OUR NATION AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE DROPPED A TRILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT ON THE BACKS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES WITH LITTLE THOUGHT TO THE OVERSIGHT CONSUMER PROTECTION WERE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS NECESSARY TO MANAGE IT. WE ENCOURAGE MILLIONS OF STUDENTS TO TAKE ON BILLIONS IN DEBT. AND THEN TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY WE SENT THEM INTO A MARKET WITH A PIECEMEAL CONSUMER PROTECTION FRAMEWORK THAT BUCKLED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THIS HISTORIC BURDEN. FROM STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS THE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS FROM DEBT COLLECTORS TO PRIVATE STUDENT LENDERS FROM PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS TO GET RELIEF SCAMS ENTIRE INDUSTRIES HAVE BUILT THEIR PROFIT MODELS AROUND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. THROUGHOUT AMERICA BIG BANKS AND SMALL SCAMS HURT MILLIONS OF BORROWERS AT EVERY POINT OF THEIR FINANCIAL LIVES. TENS OF MILLIONS OF STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS NATIONALLY AND MILLIONS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE TRAPPED IN A BROKEN SYSTEM. IF YOU ARE CHASING THE AMERICAN DREAM YOU SHOULD NOT BE RIPPED OFF AT EVERY TURN. WHETHER YOU'RE PAYING A STUDENT LOAN OR OPENING UP A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. FROM MORTGAGES TO MONEY ORDERS FROM CREDIT CARDS TO CREDIT REPORTING FROM PREPAID CARDS TO PAY DAY LOANS. ACROSS ALL OF THESE MARKETS THE CONSUMER BUREAU HAD ONE MISSION PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND THEY KNOW WHERE WAS THIS MISSION MORE IMPORTANT THAN IN THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET. A MARKET WHERE PRIOR TO THE CFPB ANY NOTION OF OVERSIGHT CAME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE SELF DESCRIBED LARGEST SPECIAL PURPOSE CONSUMER BANK IN THE WORLD. IN EFFECT LAWMAKERS PLACE THE TRILLION DOLLAR BET ON THE PROSPECT THAT A GIANT CREDITOR COULD BE TRUSTED TO SELF POLICE. THE WAITER THE FINANCIAL FUTURES OF MILLIONS OF STUDENTS AND THOSE STUDENTS LOST. STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS NEEDED A WATCHDOG THAT WAS NOT TAINTED BY ITS ROLE AS A CREDITOR AND CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR. THAT WAS NOT TRYING TO PUSH DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR. THAT WAS NOT SENDING OUT MIXED MESSAGES PROMPTED BY PERVERSE INCENTIVES. THE CFPB COULD FILL THIS ROLE BECAUSE ITS MISSION WAS CLEAR PROTECT CONSUMERS. THE CFPB WAS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY THAT UTILIZED EVERY AUTHORITY BESTOWED UPON IT BY CONGRESS FROM SUPERVISION TO ENFORCEMENT FROM DOCUMENTING COMPLAINTS TO HELPING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. IT HELP OUR WITH IN ALL FIFTY STATES AND EVERY US TERRITORY. IT HELP OUR WAYS OF EVERY AGE EVERY RACE EVERY GENDER. IT HELPED AMERICAN FAMILIES. THE CFPB OVERSAW ALL ASPECTS OF THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET FROM BANKS TO NON BANKS LENDERS TO SERVICERS IT TOOK ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE WHO BROUGHT BROKE THE LAW. FROM SMALL SCAMMERS TO LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE WELLS FARGO DISCOVERING NAV YET. AND IT WORKED. IN THOSE SEVEN YEARS THE CFPB RETURNED MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. BUT WHEN THE FORMERLY INDEPENDENT CFPB WAS PLACED UNDER THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE OF MICK MULVANEY KATHY CRYING INJURE AND THEIR APPOINTEES EVERYTHING CHANGED. THE CFPB WALKED AWAY FROM THE FORTY FOUR MILLION AMERICANS WITH STUDENT DEBT. WITH THE CFPB ONE STOOD PROUDLY AS THE MOST VOCAL NVM IN CHAMPION FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IT IS NOW WILL FULLY ABSENT. IN THE SIXTEEN MONTHS SINCE DIRECTOR CORDRAY LAUGHED THERE'S NOT BEEN A SINGLE ENFORCEMENT ACTION ANNOUNCED AGAINST THE STUDENT LOAN COMPANY. IN THOSE SIXTEEN MONTHS THERE'S NOT BEEN A SINGLE EFFORT TO EXPOSE THE RAMP IT BREAKDOWNS BORROWERS FACE ACROSS THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET. IN THOSE SIXTEEN MONTHS THERE'S NOT BEEN A SINGLE FOR PROFIT SCHOOL A SINGLE BANK SINGLE COMPANY HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HARM INFLICTED ON VULNERABLE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. IN THOSE SIXTEEN MONTHS THE BUREAU HAS PRIORITIZE THE WISHES OF THE MOST POWERFUL FINANCIAL COMPANIES IN AMERICA. OVER THE NEEDS OF THE VERY PEOPLE THEY WERE TASKED BY CONGRESS TO PROTECT ALL UNDER THE SELECTIVE INVOCATION OF STATUTORY RESTRAINT. INSTEAD A ONCE INDEPENDENT AGENCY NOW WAIT FOR PERMISSION FOR A PERMISSION SLIP FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BEFORE DOES ITS JOB. BEFORE DOES THE VERY WORK THAT IT WAS PASSED BY CONGRESS TO DEAL. THE CFPB HAS MADE THE DANGEROUS DECISION TO KEEP TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE SAME DEPARTMENT THAT UNDER BETSY DEVICE HAS USED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PLACE CORPORATIONS ABOVE CONSUMERS. THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR THERE IS NO WHITE KNIGHT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO RIDE TO THE RESCUE. THERE IS NO CALVARY ON THE HORIZON. THAT IS WHY TODAY'S HEARING MATTERS THAT IS WHY THIS COMMITTEE MATTERS THAT IS WHY STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION MATTERS. FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS THE AMERICAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS RECOGNIZED THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT STATES PLAY IN OVERSEEING FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FOUNDATIONAL PREMISE OF ANY STATE POLICE POWER IS THE ABILITY TO OVERSEE THE WELL BEING OF ITS CITIZENS. THAT INCLUDES THE POWER TO OVERSEE THE COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FINANCIAL FUTURES OF THE CITIZENS. AND THE IMPACT OF STUDENT DEBT ON THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF BORROWERS IS UNIMPEACHABLE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BUY HOMES START FAMILIES AND SEE FOR RETIREMENT. THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO START BUSINESSES OR SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES BUT THE IMPACT DOESN'T END THERE THE RIPPLES ACROSS NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE STATE. WITH ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS AFFECTING NEARLY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE FEW MARKETS AS CONSEQUENTIAL TO THE WELL BEING OF THIS STATE THEN THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET. RESEARCH NOW SHOWS THE EFFECTS OF STUDENT DEBT ON COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE ECONOMY INCLUDING STYMIE ASSET ACCUMULATION DRIVING INCOME RACIAL AND GENDER INEQUALITY. AND PREVENTING RESIDENTS FROM ESTABLISHING LONG TERM TIES TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND WHEN THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET FAILS COMMUNITY STRUGGLE. AND THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET HAS ALREADY FAILED. COMMUNITY STRUGGLE AS THE RESIDENTS FALL BEHIND IN CRITICAL CREDIT MARKETS AND FIND FEWER ECONOMIC AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES THE STRUGGLE AS LICENSE AS FEWER LICENSED PROFESSIONALS ARE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE IN HIGH DEMAND FIELDS. THE STRUGGLE THAT THEIR AGING POPULATIONS HAVE LESS FINANCIAL SECURITY. TAKING ACTION TO PROTECT STUDENT LOANBORROWERS IS NECESSARY TO THE HEALTH OF YOUR NEARLY THREE TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY. IT IS NECESSARY TO THE WELL BEING OF YOUR NEARLY FORTY MILLION CITIZENS IT IS NECESSARY TO THE WELLBEING OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT IS WHY CALIFORNIA MUST CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY. FOR YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER IN THE FIGHT FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS RATES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA PASSED ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE STUDENT LOAN SERVICING ACT THIS LAW PROVIDED KEY BUILDING BLOCK FOR THIS STATE TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT AND ROOT OUT ILLEGAL PRACTICES THAT PLAGUED THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL BASSIR STUDENT HAVE YET ONE OF THE LARGEST YOU KNOW LOAN SERVICERS IN THE COUNTRY FOR HURTING EVERY TYPE OF BORROWER WITH EVERY TYPE OF LOAN AT EVERY STAGE OF REPAYMENT. AND NOW GROUNDBREAKING NEW LEGISLATION INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO GIVE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS THE SAME KIND OF STRONG. ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS LONG PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS WITH MORTGAGES AND CREDIT CARDS. IT ALSO BRINGS REAL ACCOUNTABILITY TO A STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR RIPPING OFF BORROWERS AT EVERY TURN. IT IS DEVILISH IS A NEW CALIFORNIA STUDENT BORROWER ADVOCATE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY RUN INTO TROUBLE. AN INCREASE THE FIRST EVER PUBLIC REPORT CARD FOR THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY ENSURING REGULATORS LAWMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC CAN SPOT EMERGING REST THE BORROWERS. MY ORGANIZATION THE STUDENT BORROWER PROTECTION CENTER WITH HONOR TO JOIN WITH NEXT GEN IN CONSUMER REPORTS TO CO SPONSOR AB. THREE SEVENTY SIX DILIGENT SUPERVISION PROACTIVE ENFORCEMENT DELIBERATE RULE MAKING SMART DATA COLLECTION AND A DEEP COMMITMENT TO DEMANDING ANSWERS WHEN CONSUMERS ASK FOR HELP. THESE ARE THE MEASURES THAT THIS BILL WILL IMPLEMENT THE SAME MEASURES THAT MADE THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU OF FEARS ALLY FOR CONSUMERS. THESE CRITICAL REFORMS ALSO OFFER A PATH FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS BUT ALL CALIFORNIANS. BECAUSE CONSUMER FINANCE AFFECTS MORE THAN STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. IT'S ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE OF A BROKEN SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT THE MAN SIGNIFICAN SOLUTIONS SOLUTIONS THAT CAN MATCH THE SERIOUSNESS AND SCALE OF THE HARM PERPETUATE ACROSS THE MARKET. AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM DIRECTOR CORDRAY PROFESSOR PETER SEN AND WHAT I AM SURE YOU ARE CURRENTLY HEARING FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS. IS THAT THE PEOPLE IS THAT PEOPLE NEED HELP. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS STATE NEED YOUR HELP. AS THE FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE FOR YOUNG CONSUMERS I HEARD DIRECTLY FROM A GENERATION BORN OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. A GENERATION FORCED TO INDOOR CHALLENGES THAT THE PRIOR GENERATION HAD NEVER FATHOM. THE RATE OF YOUNG CONSUMERS BEHIND ON THEIR CAR LOANS HAS HIT RECORD LEVELS. THEY ARE AMONG THOSE HARDEST HIT BY OVERDRAFT FEES THAT SEND YOUR FINANCES SPIRALING. TWENTY THREE MILLENNIALS HAVE USED A PAYDAY LOAN SENDING THEM INTO A VICIOUS CYCLE OF DEBT. AN ENTIRE GENERATION IS BEING PREYED UPON BY FINANCIAL SYSTEM SEEKING TO STRIP THEM OF THEIR WEALTH BEFORE THEY EVER HAVE A CHANCE TO EARN IT. BUT THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT LIMITED TO YOUNG CONSUMERS FOR FOUR YEARS I HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING FOR HOLLY PATRAS. IN THE OFFICE FOR SERVICE MEMBER AFFAIRS I HEARD FROM SERVICE MEMBERS DOWN IN SAN DIEGO AT THE MARINE CORPS RECRUIT DEPOT ABOUT THE FINANCIAL PREDATORS THAT LINE UP OUTSIDE THE GATES OF INSTALLATIONS. LIKE QUOTE BEARS AT A TROUT STREAM. I NEVER CALIFORNIA'S ADJUTANT GENERAL AND HEARD TALES OF HOW MILITARY CONSUMERS ARE TARGETED BY SCHEMES FROM PENSION ADVANCES THE PREDATORY LOANS. BUT IT'S NOT JUST YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S NOT JUST SERVICE MEMBERS THE STAKES ARE SO MUCH BIGGER. AT STAKE IS THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY. WHETHER THE AMERICAN DREAM WE ALL RECOGNIZE HOUSE TO RAISE OUR FAMILY A CAR TO GET TO WORK A COLLEGE EDUCATION TO GIVE OUR KIDS A BETTER LIFE. WILL BE THE PROVINCE OF A SELECT FEW WHILE THE REST HAVE THEIR MONEY STOLEN AT EVERY TURN OR WORSE FACE THE NILES AND DISCRIMINATION BASED ON FACTORS LIKE RACE OR SEX. WHETHER WE LIVE IN A JUST AND EQUITABLE SOCIETY WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM IS OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WHO SEEK IT. OR WHETHER THAT AMERICA IS RESERVED FOR ONLY A SELECT FEW. CONSUMER FINANCE MATTERS BECAUSE THE AMERICAN DREAM MATTERS TO YOUNG PEOPLE TO SERVICE MEMBERS TO ALL CONSUMERS TO THE THIRTY MILLION ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION ACROSS AMERICA. THAT IS WHY CONSUMER PROTECTION MATTERS AND THAT IS WHY CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU MATTERS. A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU CAN DO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO DO. A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BROKEN PUSH OTHER STATES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND EVERYONE ELSE TO DO BETTER. A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BROKEN STAND UP WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FALLS DOWN. AND SO AS THIS COMMITTEE UNDERTAKES THE IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY WORK OF CRAFTING A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BEER OUT. I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER SOME OBSERVATIONS THAT I SPELL OUT IN MORE DETAIL IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY. FIRST COMPLAINTS ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF CONSUMER DRIVEN REFORM. THE CFPB GAVE POWER TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS BY GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO RAISE THEIR HAND AND SAY THIS ISN'T RIGHT. OVER A MILLION CONSUMERS WERE HELP THROUGH THE C. APPEASE SEABEES COMPLAIN PORTAL. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE CFPB LOOK AT THOSE MILLION COMPLAINTS AND RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE WERE NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS. FOR EVERY CONSUMER WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT BEING RIPPED OFF TEN MORE SAT SILENT DESPITE BEING HARMED. BUT THROUGH THAT ONE COMPLAINT THE CFPB COULD HELP ALL OF THEM. FOR SIXTY YEARS THESE COMPLAINTS WERE THE FOUNDATION OF THE CFPB IS WORK. THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BROKEN DO MORE THAN REPLICATE THIS APPROACH YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT. INSTITUTIONS REGARDLESS OF SIZE OR STRUCTURE SHOULD BE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN A ROBUST COMPLAINT RESOLUTION PROCESS. AND MAKE THE CONSUMERS COMPLAINTS PUBLIC. SECOND DISTINCT POPULATIONS CAN BRING UNIQUE INSIGHT. CONSUMER DRIVEN REFORM IS NOT LIMITED TO COMPLAINTS THE DESIGNERS OF THE CFPB REALIZE THAT SPECIAL POPULATIONS INTERACT WITH CONSUMER FINANCIAL MARKETS IN UNIQUE WAYS. AND WITH THAT OFTEN COMES UNIQUE PROBLEMS FROM THE OFFICE FOR YOUNG CONSUMERS THE OFFICE FOR SERVICE NUMBER AFFAIRS TO THE OFFICE FOR OLDER AMERICANS. DEDICATING RESOURCES TO UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEMS THAT EXPERIENCES OF THESE POPULATIONS WITH KEY TO THE CFPB SUCCESS. A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU CAN DO THE SAME. THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNIQUELY DIVERSE POPULATION OF THE STATE A REPRESENTATIVE. AND OFFICE FOR NEW AMERICANS IN OFFICE FOR ROLE AMERICANS AN OFFICE FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION. THIRD MARKET SHOULD BE DEFINED BY WHO NEEDS PROTECTION NOT WHAT A PRODUCT IS CALLED OR WHETHER AN INSTITUTION TAKE DEPOSITS. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LESSONS OF THE CRISIS WITH THAT ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REGARDLESS OF HOW STRUCTURED REGARDLESS OF PRODUCT OFFERED. NEED ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE OVERSIGHT IF WE WISH TO COUNTER THE DEEP SEATED INTRINSIC CONSUMER HARM THAT PLAGUES THE MARKET. THAT LESSON IS A TRUE NOW IS IT IS WAS THAT. CONSUMERS FINANCIAL LIVES DO NOT FIT NEATLY INTO CATEGORIES LIKE BANK AND NON BANK. NOR CONSUMERS LIES ORGANIZED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT THEY ARE USING. ANY MEANINGFUL EFFORT TO SYSTEMICALLY REFORM THE CONSUMER FINANCE MARKET MUST NECESSARILY SHARE THIS PERSPECTIVE. FOURTH BY CONSOLIDATING ALL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS UNDER ONE ROOF ONE AGENCY HAS THE AUTHORITY AND ONE AGENCY HAS THE ACCOUNTABILITY. ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL THINGS THE DODD FRANK ACT DID WAS TO CONSOLIDATE THE MOST ESSENTIAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS UNDER ONE ROOF. THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT TO THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT FOR THE DAY ARE COULD THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT TO THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT. THE CFPB HAD A RANGE OF AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS WERE PROTECTED. A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU SHOULD ENJOY THE SAME RANGE OF AUTHORITIES IN ORDER TO HOLD COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SAME RANGE OF HARM. IN CLOSING. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMON RETORTS I KNOW YOU WILL HEAR AS YOU UNDERTAKE THIS AMBITIOUS AGENDA ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE. SOME WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN ACT. OR THAT THIS IS IN WHAT STATE GOVERNMENT STILL. SOME WILL SAY THAT YOUR ASPIRATIONS ARE TOO GREAT AND THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT THE STATUS QUO. THEY WILL SEE THAT THIS IS THE WORK OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SUGGEST THAT STATES MUST ALWAYS PLAY SECOND FIDDLE. THEY WILL TELL YOU TO TEMPER YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND AMBITIONS OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE. THEY ARE WRONG THEY ARE WRONG BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS UNIQUE MOMENT IN TIME. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WILL OF THIS COMMITTEE WERE OF THIS ASSEMBLY TO ACT OF CALIFORNIA TO ACT. TO SHOW A DIFFERENT PATH THAN WHAT IS BEING OFFERED THREE THOUSAND MILES AWAY. ONE THAT PUTS PEOPLE ABOVE SPECIAL INTERESTS ONE THAT STANDS OUT FOR BORROWERS RIGHTS WHEN THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT THE WELL BEING OF THIS STATE OF THIS NATION IS PREMISED ON PROTECTING IT'S CONSUMERS WITH ITS FULL RANGE OF AUTHORITIES. WHEN THAT IS WILLING TO OVERCOME INERTIA AND IN ACTION? THEY ARE WRONG BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL STAND UP IT WILL STAND UP FOR THE THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS STATE CHASING THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND IT WILL SHOW THEM THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT PATH. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE AND THEN THE PHONE NUMBER CERVANTES. SAMBAR GABRIEL. I THINK THE FIRST HALF OF THAT IS THE CLOSE WHEN I PRESENT MY BILL THANK. YOU WE WE DON'T EVEN. THANK YOU IN AND YOU PROVIDED A GREAT DEAL OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WE TRY TO SORT THROUGH. DEALING WITH THAT THE LICENSING BILL AND AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET DONE IND OF WHAT WE COULD GET DONE IN THAT BILL AND FROM THE LICENSING PROGRAM. BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF GAPS THAT ARE STILL THERE AND I THINK FROM YOUR TESTIMONY IN PRIOR TESTIMONY DATA COLLECTION IS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT. HOW CFPB WAS ABLE TO AND TWELVE WHAT ASPECT DATA COLLECTION PLAYED? IN HOW YOU WERE THEN ABLE TO ENFORCE AND AND MANAGES FIRST I KNOW YOUR EXPERTISE AND STUDENT LOANS AND SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK IT TRANSLATES TO THE BIGGER QUESTIONS ABOUT. SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISES OF THE CREATION OF THE BUREAU WAS A REAL REALIZATION AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. THAT -- HOW COULD THE REGULATORS HAVE MISSED THIS HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED? AND THEY INSTILLED THE BUREAU BOTH THAT I THOUGHT ALREADY AND THE MIND SET TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE AWARE OF EMERGING RISKS. AND RIGHT NOW I CAN THINK OF REALLY NO LARGER AND MERGING RISK THEN THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET WE THERE'S ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT -- ONE POINT TWO ONE POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS OF THAT DEBT HE IS HELD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUT SERVICE BY INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES. AND IT'S ENTIRELY A BLACK HOLE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE BUREAU TRIED TO WORK ON WHERE WE ACTUALLY SUBMITTED -- A MARKET MONITORING REQUEST WHICH IS PROVIDED UNDER THE DODD FRANK ACT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET HOUSE SERVICERS ARE OPERATING WHERE BORROWERS ARE GETTING HURT. UNFORTUNATELY -- THIS IS JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF A VERY COMMON SENSE STRAIGHT FORWARD. A POLITICAL EXERCISE THAT WAS COMPLETELY STYMIED SO THIS WAS AN EFFORT THAT WENT INTO THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET -- IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND HAS JUST NEVER COME OUT. SO RIGHT NOW THIS EFFORT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKET -- HASN'T EVEN GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND AND NO ONE KNOWS IF IT EVER WILL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR LEGISLATION SO CRITICAL IS A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA A QUICK THROUGH DB -- WORTH THROUGH A NEW AGENCY TO GET ITS HANDS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CALIFORNIA BORROWERS IS NOT ONLY ESSENTIAL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEN FORSMAN SUPERVISION RULE MAKING. COULD BE A REAL. HELP TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AS THEY TRY TO TACKLE THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS. AND IT SEEMS AND AND OF HOW EXACTLY THAT THREAD IT SEEMS IT WHAT WHAT WE DID ON STERN LANCERS HIS WAS WITH THE BE -- ANDWE TALK ABOUT IN THE NEW LEGISLATION A STUDENT LOAN ADVOCATE BUT THAT PROBABLY SHOULD BE SOMEBODY SEPARATE AND OUTSIDE OBVIOUSLY OF D. B. S. O. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IF WE CAN BE TALKING ABOUT. SOME KIND OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION BUREAU THAT'S WHERE THAT SHOULD RESIDE AND I I HOPE WE CAN STILL HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT LOOKING FOR A STUDENT ON ADVOCATE. BUT I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ON SORT OF LITTLE THE LARGER QUESTION ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA AND MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT IN THE END PIECE MEALING SOME OF THESE PIECES TOGETHER AND AND I THINK. THAT YOU TO SORT OF START OUT WITH THE STUDENTS BUT KIND OF TIED SOME OF THE REST OF THAT TOGETHER. YES I THINK IT DEFINITELY CRITICAL I'M OBVIOUSLY BIASED TOWARDS THE POSITION BECAUSE THAT WAS MY JOB FOR A FEW YEARS -- BUT I THINK HAVING. IN DIRECTOR CORDRAY SAID THIS MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD HAVING AN AGENCY WHOSE SOLE MISSION IT IS TO LOOK OUT FOR CONSUMERS. AND THEN BEING LUCKY ENOUGH FOR THE THE SUBSET OF THAT. BUILDING THAT LOOKED OUT FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS EVERY DAY I JUST SAW THE DIFFERENCE WHERE -- ME AND MY TEAM WORK UP EVERY DAY ABOUT THINKING ABOUT STUDENT LOANS. NOT FROM AFFORDABILITY NOT FROM AN ACCESS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT STUFF BUT SIMPLY FROM A CONSUMER PROTECTION ANGLE -- WAS INCREDIBLE TO DO NOT ONLY THE BORROWERS WE HELPED BUT ADDING LIKE A REALLY VALUABLE PART OF THE DISCUSSION IN WASHINGTON I THINK I'LL BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ABOUT HOW YOU HELP BORROWERS AFTER THEY TAKE ON THE DEBT SO -- I THINK THAT -- IS ALSO VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE ONE PERSON IN GOVERNMENT SO WHEN YOU'RE CONSTITUENTS COM MORE PEOPLE JUST PICK UP THE PHONE THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO TO TRY TO GET HELP. AND THAT PARTS. PROVING VERY POPULAR. AS PEOPLE ARE WEIGHING IN ON WHERE THAT POLICY IS AND AND HAVING A PLACE TO GO. SO THAT. AS WE AS WE TRIED TO DO THE LICENSING THING AND WE HEARD FROM SOME THE LARGER SERVICERS WHO WERE COSTLY TELLING US -- THERE'S A GOOD ACTORS THERE'S A GOOD ACTORS. NOW. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SUING THEM I KNOW THEY'RE BEING SUED IN MANY MANY OTHER STATES THAT THEY'RE DOING BUSINESS. SO IT'S SORT OF HARD TO FIGURE OUT. WHO ULTIMATELY THE GOOD ACTORS ARE? NOW THAT THERE'S AND I THINK THERE'S AT LEAST ONCE WE DID THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICING. OVERSIGHT THE LICENSING PROGRAM THERE WERE OVER A DOZEN STATES THAT ARE DOING THE SAME THING NOW THOSE. THEY'RE RUNNING BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF COVER AND CLAIMING SO WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THREAD THE ISSUE OF PREEMPTION THERE NOW I KNOW THE DODD FRANK IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR. THAT STATES HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO FORWARD AND WE'RE TRYING TO RELY ON SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE. HOUSE HOW HOW MUCH PREEMPTION ESPECIALLY WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SORT OF WANTS TO WEIGH IN OR WANTS TO PROTECT THIS INDUSTRY OVER. THE BORROWERS AND AND OVER OUR CONSTITUENTS. BUT HOW CAN THEY BY DOING NOTHING. MAKE MAKE A VALID CLAIM OF PREEMPTING US FROM BEING ABLE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND AND PROVIDE A A CLEAR PATH FOR STUDENT BORROWERS. SO A COUPLE POINTS SO YOU KNOW I THINK THE FIRST POINT IS WHO ARE THE GOOD ACTORS. I THINK THE GOOD ACTORS ARE THE ONES WHO -- OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO SUPERVISION AND SAY WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE AND ALSO WE THINK THE SUPERVISORY PROCESS IN WHICH EXAMINERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT COME IN AND TELL US WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT BUT TELL US WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG IN A CONFIDENTIAL PROCESS -- THOSE THE PEOPLE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE PROVIDER OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUPERVISION OVERSIGHT BECAUSE WE THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB WE COULD ALWAYS BE DOING BETTER. WHAT SCARES ME BASED ON MY PRIOR OR THE COMPANIES WHO ARGUE THAT THEY'RE ABOVE THE LAW WHICH TAKES YOU TO YOUR SECOND POINT? AND BOTH INDUSTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAVE MADE THESE ARGUMENTS THAT FOLKS LIKE YOU FOLKS LIKE THIS STATE ARE SOMEHOW TRYING TO REGULATE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES IN AMERICA -- SOME OF THESE COMPANIES SERVICE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN CONSUMER DEBT -- TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF WHAT SIZE THIS THIS COMPANY. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN DOLLARS OF NON CONSUMER DEBT IN AMERICA. AND THEY ARE ARGUING THAT YOUR STATE LAWS DON'T APPLY -- AND I JUST THINK THAT IS WRONG I THINK ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT BILL DID WHAT OTHER STATES ARE TRYING TO DO NOW WHAT THE EXTENSION BILL THE BAR A BILL OF RIGHTS DOES. IS JUST RECOGNIZE THE TRADITIONAL POLICE POWERS THAT THIS STATE HAS ALWAYS HAD THAT IT CURRENTLY USES ACROSS A RANGE OF NON BANK PROVIDERS -- AND MERELY EXTENDS THAT. TO FOR MANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS THE MOST IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANY IN THEIR LIVES WHICH IS THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR TRYING TO HELP THEM PAY OFF THEIR DEBT. SO I KNOW THE ARGUMENTS ARE THERE I KNOW THAT THEY'RE A SOURCE OF CONSTERNATION -- I THINK IN MANY REGARDS THE EFFORT IS TO KIND OF THROW A LOT OF SMOKE UP IN THE AIR AND FIGURE OUT WHICH LEGISLATURE'S WHICH THINKING DEPARTMENTS WHICH ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. ARE WILLING TO PUSH THRILL AND WHERE I THINK STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ARE. SHOULD BE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS OF THIS COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PUSH PAST A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS WE'VE HEARD BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS A GOOD FOR MANY PEOPLE THE LARGEST. CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUKTIVNOSTI CHEN AND THE COMPANIES AT THE CENTER OF THIS JUST AREN'T DOING THE JOB. AND THAT THERE IS A THERE IS A ROLE FOR STATES TO PLAY. IN FOR A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IT'S THEIR SINGLE LARGEST THAT OR THEIR SECOND BECAUSE STUDENT LOAN THAT IS REALLY ONLY SECOND BEHIND HOME MORTGAGES. BUT YET HOME MORTGAGES CREDIT CARDS CAR LOANS THERE ARE. STRONGER REGULATORY SCHEMES FOR PROTECTIONS THERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE IF ANYTHING FOR STUDENT LOAN. BORROWERS TO TO RELY AND WE'RE WE'RE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THE GAP WERE ULTIMATELY TRY TO FAIL AND YOU DON'T YEAH. EXACTLY RIGHT AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD ON IT SO SECRETARY MINU CHIN PUT OUT A BIG REPORT ABOUT THE STATE OF THINK FINTECH IN OTHER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. AND THERE WAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SECTION TALKING ABOUT STUDENT LOANS AND STUDENT LOAN SERVICING. AND HIS WORDS WERE THE SAME THERE ARE NO FEDERALLY GUARANTEED STANDARDS FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS AGAIN THIS ISN'T LIKE A POLITICAL PARTISAN ISSUE. IT IS A GENERATION OF BORROWERS OLD RURAL URBAN YOU NAME IT -- WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING AND IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ISN'T GOING TO DO ITS JOB -- THEN I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE'S TO FILL IN THE GAP. AND SO FAR WHAT WE'VE DONE HAVE BROUGHT A LOT OF OTHER STATES ALONG SO I THINK THERE ARE STATES THAT ARE. CERTAINLY WATCHING CALIFORNIA WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WHAT WE WILL DO AND I THINK WE NEED TO TO TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY I THINK JUST ONE QUICK THING I THINK YOU KNOW. YOU STARTED THIS YOU KNOW A VERY LONG TIME AGO LIKE THIS WAS NOT ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S WAS NOT ABOUT THAT TO DIVIDE US. THERE'S BEEN FAILURES ACROSS THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICING INDUSTRY ACROSS PARTIES ACROSS THE MINISTRATIONS -- AND I THINK IT'S A TESTAMENT TO YOU THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS STATE TO REALIZE THAT. REGARDLESS OF WHO'S SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE OF WHO WAS AT THE BUREAU THIS WAS A CENTRAL -- RESPONSIBILITY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO STAND UP FOR ITS PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND I THINK THAT IS -- THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO YOUR WORK WELL AND THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE WE STARTED THIS AND THE NEXT AT ONE POINT ONE OF THE STEPS WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO TAKE WAS TO HARMONIZE. THE STATE'S LAW WITH THE FEDERAL REGULATORY SCHEME THAT WAS COMING OUT THAT'S SCHEME DISAPPEARED SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO HARMONIZE WITH WE WERE SORT OF LEFT ON OUR OWN. THAT'S WHERE WE ENDED UP AND THAT WAS WHAT LED TO THE PASSING OF THE STUDENTS SERVICER LICENSING PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU REMEMBER CERVANTES YES THANK YOU WHAT YOU DID -- TOUCH ON A QUESTION THAT I HAD BUT I JUST WANT TO SPEAK AS A MILLENNIAL -- MILLENNIALS ARE A GENERATION SHAPED BY EXPERIENCES LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION AND HIGH LEVELS OF STUDENT DEBT AND SO THIS ISSUE IS A VERY MUCH OF A CONCERN TO ME AND THAT I AM ADDRESS SEEN IN. CERTAIN POLICY ITEMS AS WELL THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION -- BUT THANK YOU FOR GIVING US SOME ACTIONABLE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE A AS A STATE TO ADDRESSES SO THANK YOU. AS A MEMBER GABRIEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR YOUR SERVICE IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ALSO VERY MUCH CONCERNING TO HEAR YOU TESTIFY ABOUT THE CURRENT CFPB IN ITS. EFFORTS TO PRIORITIZE CORPORATIONS ABOVE CONSUMERS AND THE STRUGGLE FACED BY. SO MANY STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS WHICH AS YOU PUT IT DEEPLY IMPACTS THEIR PROSPECTS FOR CHEATING THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE FACT THAT THE REALLY AS YOU AS YOU DESCRIBED IT NO LARGER EMERGING REST IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT I MEAN HE'S JUST VERY CONCERNING TESTIMONY YOU'RE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT. OF CREDIBILITY ON THAT ISSUE. GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE IN YOUR VANTAGE POINT WOULD YOU THINK ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS THE CALIFORNIA CAN TAKEN GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THIS MATTER WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT WE PRIORITIZE. SO -- A COUPLE THINGS I MENTION MY TESTIMONY I THINK -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S BILL -- IS CRITICAL -- BOTH FOR THIS STATE AND I THINK AS WE'VE SEEN WITH PRIOR WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. QUICKLY BECOMES THE ROAD MAP THAT OTHER STATES WILL FOLLOW SO GIVING BORROWER GIVING BORROWERS THE SAME RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS THAT THEY HAVE IF THEY HAD A CREDIT CARD OR MORTGAGE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO. AT THE STATE LEVEL WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT LOANS. MAKING SURE THAT WHEN BORROWERS GET RIPPED OFF THEY HAVE THE RIGHTS AND THE ABILITY TO SEEK JUSTICE -- AT THE STATE LEVEL IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THIS STATE IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF BETTER OVERSEEING THE MARKET BOTH IN TERMS OF THE ADVOCATE. AND THE MARKET BOTHERING EXPERIENCES I THINK WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING. THAT MILLIONS OF STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN THIS STATE. I THINK THIS IS THE SECOND PIECE I THINK THIS GOES TO SEVEN NUMBER SO IT'S COMMON IS THERE'S GONNA BE SOME BATTLES THAT COME UP I THINK THAT THERE IS A CONCERTED EFFORT. BY INDUSTRY -- AND THE CARD ADMINISTRATION AND SOME HARD SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TELL WHERE ONE ENDS AND WHERE THE OTHER BEGINS TO ESSENTIALLY MAKE THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO HELP STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. AS PAINFUL AS POSSIBLE FOR YOU GUYS FOR YOUR BANKING DEPARTMENT FOR YOUR ATTORNEY GENERAL -- AND SO FAR WE'VE SEEN THEM -- STICK IT OUT. TAKEN SOME PRETTY BIG FIGHTS AND I THINK ENSURING AS YOU WANT THEM TO BE TAKING I THINK WILL BE CRITICAL -- BECAUSE AT THE SAME EVER STONE'S BILL I THINK THE SUBSEQUENT BILL WILL REALLY EMPOWER THEM TO DO A REALLY GOOD JOB ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWERS IN THE STATES. BUT THEN ENCOURAGING OVERSEEING AND MAKING SURE THE FOLLOW THROUGH IS THERE I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER FROM AND FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR EXPERIENCE. NOW WE HAVE OUR FINAL PANEL -- IT'S RELATED TO ENFORCEMENT AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE AS TO ST MARTIN DALE FROM CONSUMER REPORTS SUREN VELASQUEZ FROM GREEN LINING INSTITUTE AND CAT TAYLOR FOUNDER OF BENEFICIAL STATE BANK -- THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVITE THEM UP TO TESTIFY WE WILL HAVE YOU GO AHEAD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS SUZANNE MARTIN DOWN SENIOR POLICY COUNSEL AT CONSUMER REPORTS FORMALLY KNOWN AS CONSUMERS UNION. I WILL MAKE SOME THOUGHT USE MY TIME TO MAKE SOME BRIEF REMARKS TO SORT OF DISTILLED DOWN WHAT WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM SEVERAL ACTS OFFICIALS -- AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU WHO ARE CLEARLY A WEALTH OF INFORMATION AND INSIGHT INTO THE WORKINGS OF THE BUREAU AND THE LESSONS LEARNED FOR STATES. SO AS WE APPROACH THE DISCUSSION OF ENFORCEMENT WE'VE HEARD DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF WHAT ENFORCEMENT MEANS SOMETIMES IT REALLY DOESN'T MEAN. INVESTIGATING BRINGING A CASE LIKE THE CALIFORNIA TRADE GENERAL HAS JUST ON AGAINST NOW VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOR LOAN SERVICING&lt;/c&gt; FAILURES -- IT CAN MEAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT RECENTLY DIDN'T FILING AN ACTION TO REVOKE THE LICENSE OF FAST MONEY ON AUTO AUTO TITLE UNDER THAT WAS EVADING THE LAW. AND ENGAGING IN -- ALLEGEDLY DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES BUT IN THE BROADER SENSE -- OF WHAT IN FORSMAN CAN LOOK LIKE IN THAT CAN MEET ADDITIONAL TOOLS THAT CREATE THE CONDITIONS OF POSSIBILITY FOR STRONG ENFORCEMENT AND SO THE THE TOOLS OF THE CFPB HAS IN PARTICULAR. AROUND SUPERVISION -- SUPERVISION AN EXAMINATION AUTHORITY TO UNCOVER POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS RESEARCH IN MARKET MONITORING FUNCTIONS ENABLE. THE AGENCY TO COMPEL DATA AND IDENTIFY TRENDS RESEARCH PUBLICATION OF PUBLIC EDUCATION GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND AND AND LETTING THE PUBLIC KNOW -- THAT THERE ARE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WITH STUDENT LOANS ARE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS OF MORTGAGES I'M COLLECTING CONSUMER COMPLAINTS -- AND HAVING A PUBLICLY SEARCHABLE DATABASE AGAIN ENABLES THAT I TRANSPARENCY IN DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE PUBLIC THESE ADDITIONAL TOOLS. ALL GIVEN TO THE BUREAU WITH COMPREHENSIVE AUTHORITY OVER ENTIRE INDUSTRY. WITH THE CONSUMER PROTECTION MISSION BACKING IT UP THAT IS WHAT HAS MADE THE BUREAU -- IS SO SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST AT HELPING US LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS IN THE MARKET PLACE IN ASSURING BETTER STANDARDS AND AND AT THE END OF THE DAY RETURNING A LOT OF MONEY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK. TO CONSUMERS SO THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE APPROACH IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN COURT HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE EXISTING AGENCIES THAT DO PLAY CONSUMER PROTECTION ROLE WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT WE HAVE. THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT HAVE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION FRAMEWORK BUT WE NEED SOMETHING MORE UNIFIED MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND I WOULD SAY -- COORDINATED SO I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED APPROACH TO ENSURING CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA. IRRESPECTIVE OF YOUR SETTING ASIDE FOR NOW HOW WE'RE LITTLE GOING TO STAND THIS UP I THINK THOSE NEED TO BE ON OUR NORTH STAR PRINCIPLES FOR HOW WE MOVE FORWARD FROM HERE ON OUT. NOW OUR PREVIOUS PANELISTS MENTIONED SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF HOW THE BUREAU WAS ABLE TO BE A AFFECTED CERTAINLY TALKED ABOUT THE COMPREHENSIVE TOOLS -- AND THE AND THE INDUSTRY WIDE JURISDICTION THE BUREAU HOUSE BY D°ûI HIGHLY JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT SHOW HOW HAVING. A NEW UNIT OR A NEW AGENCY ISN'T NECESSARILY TO PUT COULD HAVE BEEN A FACTOR CAN MAKE. THE WHOLE BETTER AND GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS -- BY HAVING THAT FORCE MULTIPLIER OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION FOCUSES SO ONE EXAMPLE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE MILITARY LENDING ACT -- WHICH SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX IT WAS ENACTED UNDER THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION I'M HAS ENSURED THAT ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS ARE NOT CHARGED MORE THAN 36% APR. IT'S BEEN IT WAS ON THE BOOKS FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THE CFPB CAME ON THE SCENE WHEN THEY FINALLY HAD THE SUPERVISION AUTHORITY WITH THE CONSUMER PROTECTION LANDS OVER BANKS THEY WERE ABLE TO UNCOVER POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS. AND A PUNCTURE PUBLISHED A REPORT BUT THEN HELD A ENCOURAGED THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE WHICH OTHERWISE OF MINISTERS OF THE MILITARY LENDING ACT TO AMEND ITS REGULATIONS TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE CFPB. PROVIDING USING OTHER TOOLS NOT PER SE ENFORCEMENT LAWSUITS BUT USING OTHER TOOLS TO HELP THE DOD DOING A BETTER JOB OF IMPLEMENTING AND OVERSEEING THE MILITARY LENDING ACT. ANOTHER ONE THAT IS -- YOUR NEAR AND DEAR TO ALL OF US WHO HAVE STUDENT LOANS -- IS THIS YOU THESE ROLE IN MAKING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BETTER I AS AS A AS A HAS ALREADY BEEN TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OF COURSE OVERSEAS THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS AND IT DOES ISSUE AID TO STUDENTS AND HAS OVERSIGHT ROLE OF SCHOOLS BUT IT WAS NEVER SET UP AS A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE EVER EXPECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO BECOME A TRILLION DOLLAR BANK. IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND SO IT HAS A MASSIVE PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND THE SERVICING OF THOSE LOANS THEY HAVE LARGELY OUTSOURCED TO TO PRIVATE COMPANIES TO THE LOAN SERVICERS -- AND SO AND OF COURSE ALSO BEARS MENTIONING THAT IN THE EARLY PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN MARKET THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO ROLE SO WHEN THE CPB WAS ABLE TO STEPIN. TO SUPERVISE -- BOTH FEDERAL AND PRIVATE EDUCATION LOAN SERVICERS HANDLE COMPLAINTS ON COVER PROBLEMS AND WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- THE CPP WAS ABLE WAS BETTER ABLE TO ENSURE THAT SOMEONE WAS TAKING THAT KIND OF COLD COHERENT COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION FOCUSED LOOK AT THE PROBLEM OF STUDENT LOANS AT ALL OF US MYSELF INCLUDED ARE STRUGGLING TO GET GET OUT FROM UNDER -- AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHTS ONE SPECIFIC AREA WHERE THE WHERE THE C. P. B. REALLY WHAT WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE AND THAT WAS DURING. THE IMPENDING COLLAPSE OF THE CLINTON COLLEGES -- WHICH HAD FOR MANY MANY YEARS -- AS ANY LEGAL AID ADVOCATE WILL TELL YOU -- HAD BEEN MAKING FALSE PROMISES GETTING STUDENTS IN THE DOOR. PUTTING THEM IN DEBT AND THE NOT TRAINING THEM AND THE WAY THEY WERE PROMISED IN SO MANY STUDENTS WE'RE STUCK WITH THAT THE COULD NOT REPAY WE'RE NOT GETTING A PROPER EDUCATION AND EVENTUALLY IT CAUGHT UP WITH CURRENT IN THEIR FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT -- ACTUALLY CAME OUT FINALLY CAME UNDER THE RADAR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND AS A LOOK AT THE CORINTHIAN COLLEGES WERE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE. THE CPB WAS WELL POISED AT THAT TIME TO POINT OUT BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY DONE SOME INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE LENDING PRACTICES OF CURRENT THE AND HOW -- CORINTHIAN COLLEGES HAD NOT JUST BEEN MAKING FALSE PROMISES TO STUDENTS TO GET THEM TO TAKE OUT FEDERAL LOANS IT SEPARATELY BINS STEERING THEM INTO PRIVATE LOANS WHICH OF COURSE DO NOT HAVE ANY REAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT TODAY. AND OUT OF THE CLASS WAS HAPPENING TO CONSIDER THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU'S ABILITY TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO NEGOTIATE A WINDING DOWN OF THE COLLEGES. THAT RESULTED IN THE BUREAU BEING ABLE TO SECURE MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PRIVATE STUDENT DEBT RELIEF FOR BORROWERS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON ITS OWN SIMPLY COULD NOT HAVE DONE -- SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW HAVING AGAIN THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ORIENTED AGENCY WITH COMPREHENSIVE JURISDICTION IN THE ABILITY TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER AGENCIES. MADE OUR FINANCIAL REGULATORY SYSTEM THE BETTER FOR ALL OF THAT -- SO THESE ARE SOME LESSONS I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY SO AGAIN WE NEED TO LOOK -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THIS PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT OF STATE LEVEL CONSUMER PROTECTION FRAMEWORK -- I THINK THAT COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED TOOLS FOR ENSURING A STRONG AND DILIGENT FORCE MEN ARE GOING TO SERVICE ALL BETTER AND THEN TO PIVOT -- TO WERE ALL OUR NEXT PANELIST WILL GO I WILL MENTION THAT. THE PREVIOUS PANELIST RAISE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SPECIAL POPULATIONS OF THAT THE BUREAU HAS STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO LOOK AT STUDENTS SERVICE MEMBERS SENIORS AND TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS SO IS ALSO AN EQUITY LENDS BUILT INTO. THE WAY THE BUREAU IS STRUCTURED AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WHERE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD WE SHOULD APPLY THAT PRINCIPLE -- BECAUSE A LOT OF THE OF THE PRIORITY LEGISLATIVE ISSUES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE STOPPING PREDATORY LENDING THAT AFFECTS UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES -- YOU KNOW TRYING TO REIN IN THE ABUSES OF THE STEW LOAN SERVICING INDUSTRY AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT EQUITY AND IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER VALUE. BUT I THINK WE WANT TO TO CARRY WITH US AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE NEXT BEST STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTING A STATE LEVEL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION FRAMEWORK IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS MARTIN THE MISSILE ASK US GREAT THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH CHARLIE MOURN FOR HAVING ME SPEAK TODAY IN TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- A MATURE VELASQUEZ IN A SERVER SENIOR PROGRAM MANAGER AT THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE GREEN LINING IS A POLICY THINK TANK ADVANCING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- WE SPECIFICALLY WORK WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES -- TO ADDRESS THE ENTRANCE LEGACY OF REDLINING. WHICH IS THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP OR THE DIFFERENCE IN WITH HOLDINGS ACROSS RACIAL GROUPS BOTH RED LINING AND THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP ARE ARE VERY WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE OUR REALITY. OTHER COMP COMMUNITIES GRAPPLE WITH THEM. IN THE PRESENT AGREE LANDING IS A LONG TIME SUPPORTER OF THE CFPB IN OF ITS PRIMARY IN STATUTORILY VESTED PURPOSE AS A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY -- AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE CFPB WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM FRAUDULENT AND ABUSIVE FINANCIAL ACTORS AS AS A RESPONSE TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS. YET TODAY UNDER CURRENT LEADERSHIP AND AGENCY FOUNDED AS THE PEOPLE THE BUREAU HAS IN MANY WAYS GROW CLOSER TO THE INDUSTRY -- ONE OF THE MOST CONCERNING CHANGES IN THE BUREAU IS A ROLL BACK IN FAIR LENDING WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A CORRUPTION OF THE CFE BEES PURPOSE. THE CFPB TRADITIONAL VIGILANCE WAS CRITICAL FOR CONSUMERS OF COLOR BECAUSE THE AGENCY WAS NOT RACE BLINDNESS OVERSIGHT. REMAIN COGNIZANT OF THE UNFORTUNATE TWENTY FIRST REALITY THAT SKIN COLOR STILL DETERMINES ACCESS TO SAFE AND SOUND FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. AMPLE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR CONTINUE FACING RACISM IN MORTGAGE AUTO SMALL BUSINESS AND CREDIT CARD LENDING THIS CAN MEAN THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR RECEIVE SMALLER AMOUNTS. THE REQUESTED WHEN LOOKING FOR LOANS ARE PRODUCTS UNFAVORABLE TERMS AND HIGHER RATES OF DENIAL COMPARED TO THE WORRY AT COUNTERPARTS. DESPITE THESE REALITIES THE CFE BEES NEW LEADERSHIP HAS TAKEN THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WHICH THREATEN THE PEOPLE OF COLORS RIGHT TO ACCESS BRING TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF TIME ONLY FOCUS ON FOR A QUESTION THE THEORY OF DISPARATE IMPACT AND LIMITED THE USE OF DISPARATE IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. THIS IS A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS THAT LOOK FOR DIFFERENCES IN HOW LENDING. PRACTICES AFFECT VARIOUS COMMUNITIES WERE IN -- CASES ARE BROUGHT TO UNDER THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT IT'S A POWERFUL ENFORCEMENT TOOL THAT HAS BEEN USING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CFE BEES FOR LENDING CASES -- JUST EVEN GENERALLY SPEAKING IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THERE'S BEEN A SEVERE DROP IN THEM -- IN A ARTICLE DATED -- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OCTOBER -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN Q. THREE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE ONLY SIX ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS COMPARED TO Q. Q. THREE OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE'D BEEN. THIRTY ONE OUR NUMBER TWO IT'S RIPPED ITS OFFICE OF FAIR LENDING AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY OF ENFORCEMENT POWERS AND RESTRUCTURED AS A UNIT OF INTERNAL ADVOCACY. UNDER DODD FRANK THE OFFICE WAS TASKED WITH OVERSIGHT ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL LAWS INTENDED TO ENSURE THE FAIR EQUITABLE AND NON DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. OUR NUMBER THREE SEEKING TO CREATE FINTECH SANDBOXES -- AND I SHOULD SAY EXPAND FINTECH SANDBOXES A TESTING GROUND FOR ONLINE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS -- THAT PROVIDE BLANKET IMMUNITY FROM STATE AND FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. GIVEN THE ROLL BACK A FAILING AND FAIR LENDING ENFORCEMENT THIS BLANKET IMMUNITY IS ALL THE MORE CONCERNING BECAUSE FINTECH -- SERVICES THE UNDER BEING A MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND FOURTH -- SUSPENDING IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION TEN SEVENTY ONE OF DODD FRANK SECTION TEN SEVENTY ONE REQUIRED THE CFPB TO IMPLEMENT SMALL BUSINESS DATA COLLECTION AND TO MAKE THE DATA PUBLIC. NOTABLY IT REQUIRED THE COLLECTION OF RACE AND GENDER OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE CURRENTLY THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE SMALL BUSINESS DATA COLLECTION -- AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS RULE WAS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED AS WELL THAT'S SMALL WOMEN OWNED AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES STRUGGLE TO ACCESS STATEMENT SYSTEM CREDIT. IN CONCLUSION THESE ACTIONS WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND BAR PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM FULLY AND FAIRLY PARTICIPATING IN OUR ECONOMY. IN TERMS OF HOW CALIFORNIA CAN STEP UP -- YOU KNOW CLEARLY THESE ACTIONS SHOW THAT CONSUMER PROTECTION ARE IN THE HANDS OF STATES NOW -- SO IT'S HEARTENING TO SEE TEARS LIMON. LEADERSHIP IN EXPLORING HOW THE STE A STATE CAN STEP UP AND PROTECT CONSUMERS AND TO SEE GOVERNOR NEW SOME PRIORITIZE HIGH COST LENDING. I THINK THAT WHAT THIS LEADERSHIP CALIFORNIA'S WELL POISED TO BE A NATIONAL EXAMPLE. IN TERMS OF SOLUTIONS ARE FOCUSING ON THE DB O. RIGHT -- YOU KNOW THE DB OWE THE CURRENT ITERATION OF THE DB O. WAS CREATED TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH THE MERGER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CORPORATIONS -- YOU KNOW WHAT COULD THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE BILL LOOK LIKE DB O. TWO POINT NO IF WE CAN CALL IT THAT -- AND I THINK THAT INCLUDES THE BETTER RESOURCE SEEING IT AS OUR SINGLE IN STATE FINANCIAL REGULATOR WITH THE CHURCH ALREADY LOOKING INTO. SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEYS TO HANDLE FOR LENDING INVESTIGATIONS -- NEXT. POTENTIALLY LOOKING INTO AN EXPANDING SMALL BUSINESS DATA COLLECTION -- ALTHOUGH WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT STATE LEVEL RACE DATA DUE TO THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT WE CAN EXPLORE COLLECTING OTHER INFORMATION TO DETERMINE LENDING AND MINORITY. OR MAJORITY MINORITY CENSUS TRACKS AND TO DETERMINE THE QUALITY OF LENDING. NEXT SILICON VALLEY IS IN OUR BACKYARD AND WE NEED TO BE MORE PROACTIVE AND LESS REACTIVE TO THE THINK CHANGING FACE OF FINANCE -- WE SHOULD PROVIDE THE D. B. O. ADEQUATE TECHNOLOGY TO AUDIT FINTECH ALGORITHMS AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT RAISING FOR LENDING CONCERNS -- FOR INSTANCE THERE'S A RECENT UC BERKELEY STUDY SHOWING THAT ONLINE AND IN PERSON MORTGAGE LENDERS STILL OVER PRICE LATINO AND BLACK -- MORTGAGE BORROWERS -- AND THIS WOULD YOU KNOW POP CREE MORE TRANSPARENCY IN THAT LANDING AREA -- ASIDE FROM THE D. BO WE CAN TAKE A PAGE FROM MARYLAND BY CREATING A FINANCIAL CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMISSION -- MARYLAND ESTABLISHED THIS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE STATE'S PRIORITIES AND NEXT STEPS WOULD BE IN RESPONSE TO THE CFPB ROLL BACKS A MEMBERSHIP ON THIS COMMISSION AGAIN TO STUDENTS POINT ON COORDINATION. COULD INCLUDE LEGISLATORS ATTORNEY GENERAL THE DB OWE THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ADVOCATES AMONG OTHERS -- KNACKS PASSING LEGISLATION REQUIRING A RACIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS WHEN CONSIDERING BANKING RELATED MATTERS FOR INSTANCE UNDER STATUE ILLINOIS IS REQUIRED TO CONDUCT THIS ANALYSIS IF IT CONSIDERS RACING -- CHECK CASHING FEES IN THE FUTURE -- THEY'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN EXPANDING THIS ANALYSIS TO OTHER POLICY AREAS. AND LASTLY -- YOUR MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT ALSO KNOWN AS THE CRA THE C. R. A.'S UNDER ATTACK BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND THE C. R. A.'S A CIVIL RIGHTS LAW REQUIRING BANKS TO SERVE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THOSE TRADITIONALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THERE'S ALSO REQUIREMENT THAT THE BANKS REINVEST IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO WITH THEIR TAKING DEPOSITS FROM OUR COMMUNITIES THEY SHOULD RE INVESTOR COMMUNITIES. THESE PRIVATE DOLLARS HELP FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SMALL BUSINESS LOANS MORTGAGES A BROADBAND -- IF CALIFORNIA WORK TO PASS SUCH A RESOLUTION IT WOULD BE THE FIRST DAY IN THE NATION -- TO BE VOCAL ABOUT SUPPORTING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO BANKING FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF RACE IN INCOME AND TO UNDERSCORE HOW CRA MUST BE STRENGTHENED NOT WEAKENED. THE CONCLUSION THERE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO TO GET BY CALIFORNIANS IN THANK YOU CHARLIE MORE FOR SEIZING THE MOMENT. CATERPILLAR MISS TAYLOR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN LIMON AND COMMITTEE IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY -- IS ALSO MY HONOR TO REPRESENT BENEFICIAL STATE BANK MY HUSBAND TOM STIERS AND I AND FIFTEEN FINANCE PROFESSIONALS. STARTED A BANK ON A HUNCH THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT IN THE BANKING SYSTEM. IN FACT IT WAS ON THE EVE OF THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH WAS PRECIPITATED BY INCREASINGLY RISKY BEHAVIOR BY THE BIGGEST BANKS IN THE SYSTEM. THAT WE PLACED OUR FDIC STICKER IN THE OAKLAND BRANCH HEADQUARTERS. ON JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND THEN WE WATCH THE CREDIT MARKETS BURNED DOWN AND THE BANK CIRCLE THEIR WAGONS. AND I NOTE THAT THE VERY SAME BANKS OR EVEN BIGGER NOW AND HAVE NOT SEE SIR OVERLY AT RISK HE WAITS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BRIGHT THEIR BALANCE SHEETS THEY ARE NOT LENDING MUCH MONEY INTO THE MAIN ECONOMY INSTEAD THEY ARE INVESTING IN SPECULATIVE HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE TO THE STEWARDSHIP OF DEPOSITORS MONEY. SO BENEFICIAL STATE BANKS TRIAL WAS BY FIRE AND WE HAVE COME THROUGH THE WORST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. PROVING THAT A TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE MODEL OF BANKING CANCERS SUCCEED. IN ELEVEN YEARS WE HAVE GROWN TO ONE BILLION IN ASSETS SEVENTEEN BRANCH OFFICES ACROSS THREE WEST COAST STATES WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EMPLOYEES. WE PRODUCE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL WELL BEING IN EQUAL MEASURE TO OUR FINANCIAL RETURNS. 1100% OF OUR ECONOMIC RIGHTS ARE HELD BY A PUBLIC CHARITY FOUNDATION THAT IS PERMANENTLY GOVERN IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. WE DEDICATE 75% OF OUR LENDING PRACTICES TO A NEW ECONOMY THAT IS FULLY INCLUSIVE RACIALLY ENGENDERED JUST AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESTORATIVE AND THE OTHER 25% CANNOT BE WORKING AGAINST OUR TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE -- OVER WE ARE RADICALLY TRANSPARENT ABOUT ALL OF OUR CORPORATE PRACTICES INCLUDING OUR LIVING WAGE POLICY WHERE WE PAY ONE HUNDRED AND 50% OF LIVING WAGE. FULLY BENEFITTED AT A MINIMUM TO ALL OUR EMPLOYEES IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE ONE THIRD OF BANK TELLERS ARE ON SOME FORM OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. IN SPITE OF BEING EMPLOYED BY SOME OF THE MOST PROFITABLE CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD. SO IT'S A FALSE DICHOTOMY THAT WE CAN'T RUN A SUSTAINABLE BANK AND ACT HONORABLY. WE HAD BENEFICIAL STATE BANK ARE DOING JUST THAT AND SO ARE COUNTLESS OTHER COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BANKS CREDIT UNIONS AND LOAN FUNDS. WHO COMMIT TO LANDING 60% OF THEIR LOAN DOLLARS INTO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CENSUS TRACKS? HOWEVER IT THESE CONCERTED EFFORTS ARE NOT NEARLY ENOUGH THE BIGGEST BANKS MUST ALSO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION AND NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF TAXPAYERS OR CONSUMERS. IF ANYTHING IT'S THE UNDER HANDED PRACTICES OF THE BIGGEST BANKS THAT MAKE IT HARD FOR A BANK LIKE OURS TO THRIVE. WHEN THEIR PREDATORY WAYS SET THE PACE FOR BANK PRODUCTS AND SERVICES? THERE IS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AND THOSE OF US ON OFFERING HONORABLE PRODUCTS STRUGGLE TO COMPETE. ALSO PREDATORY BANKING PRACTICES DEPLETE HOUSEHOLDS IN COMMUNITIES OF THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND RESILIENCY TO CREATE A LOCAL LIVING ECONOMY. WHERE AS GOOD BANKING PRACTICES CREATE HEALTHY BORROWERS AND COMMUNITIES AND MAKE ALL BANK STRIVE TO PERFORM BETTER? TAKE A LOOK AT BANK OF THE WEST OUT OF PURE ENLIGHTENED SELF INTEREST THEY JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL PAY ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AT LEAST FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND DIVEST FROM FOSSIL FUELS OVER A TIME LINE. BY DINT OF RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC PRAGUE IS SECOND ONLY BE GRANTED BY THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER IN THE END. LIKE FDIC INSURANCE AND THE POWER OF BORROWING FROM THE FED ALL BANKING IS BECAUSE I PUBLIC. WE POOL OUR IDLE CASH OR OUR DEPOSITS TO THE TUNE OF THIRTEEN TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY LOAN. TO FINANCE A FUTURE IN WHICH WE ACTUALLY WISH TO LIVE NOT ONE MARRED BY VOLATILE ECONOMIC CYCLES MORTGAGE FRAUD AND PREDATORY CONSUMER PRODUCTS. WE THINK OF BANKING AS THE ORIGINAL AND MOST POWERFUL FORM OF CROWD FUNDING. IT'S NOT THAT IS SPECIFIC DEPOSIT FINANCES A SPECIFIC LOAN BUT ALL DEPOSITS FINANCE A LENDING PRACTICE. AND IN THAT LENDING PRACTICE BANKS SHOULD BE ALLEGIANCE TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS CUSTOMERS COLLEAGUES COMMUNITIES AND THE PLANET UPON WHICH WE ALL DEPEND AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC INTEREST AT LARGE. IN RECOGNITION OF THIS PUBLIC DUTY BENEFICIAL STATE BANK AS OPEN SOURCE A SET OF BANKING STANDARDS TO WHICH WE HOLD OURSELVES AND INVITE OTHER BANKS REGULATORS AND MASS CONSUMER MOVEMENTS. TO IT HERE. WE SHOULD ALL SCRUTINIZE THE OWNERSHIP OF BANKS TO ENSURE IT RESPECTS THOSE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS. LENDING AND INVESTMENT PRACTICES MUST BE FOCUSED ON THE NEW ECONOMY. BANK PRODUCTS SHOULD MAKE THOSE WHO TAKE THEM UP HEALTHY OR THE DAY AFTER THAN THEY WERE THE DAY BEFORE. AND OUR INSTITUTIONS CORPORATE PRACTICES SHOULD EMBODY CONDUCT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF OUR ADVOCACY MUST BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND NOT IN OUR SELF INTEREST ALONE. AND THERE MUST ALSO BE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT EVERYTHING WE DO. THOSE ARE MINIMUM OBLIGATIONS ON TOP OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN A SAFE AND SOUND MANNER. DOING NO HARM IS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. A COMMITMENT WOEFULLY LACKING FROM THE MAIN BANKING ACTORS. WHEN BANKS EQUIPPED WITH LOW COST FUNDING OUR DEPOSITS LEVERAGE WITH AT LEAST TEN TO ONE TIMES AND ACCESS TO FED FUNDS? THEN INFLICT HARM NO AMOUNT OF DOING GOOD PLASTERED ON BILLBOARDS OR FULL PAGE ADS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES CAN COMPENSATE FOR THAT HARM. BANKING DRIVE SOCIETAL OUTCOMES NOT JUST ECONOMIC ONES WHEN THE BIGGEST BANKS CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPORT FOSSIL FUELS PRIVATE PRISONS AND PAYDAY LENDING. THEIR BREACHING THEIR PUBLIC DUTY. AND DISRESPECTING THE DISPOSITIVE DEPOSITORS FROM HOME THEIR LARGEST CREDIT COMES. THESE INSIGHTS AS A REAL ACTOR IN THE BANKING SYSTEM LEAD ACID BENEFICIAL STATE BANK TO BE O A STRONG BELIEF THAT ANY FURTHER DEREGULATION OF THE BANKS WOULD BE A MISTAKE. IN FACTFURTHER REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE PLACED ON THEM LIKE COUNTER CYCLICAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS A CONTINUING NEED FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION AND ENFORCEMENT. THOSE GAINS CONSISTS SECURED BY THE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. DURING SENATOR WARNS AND DIRECTOR CORD REYES OVERSIGHT WILL SOON BE LOST IF WE DO NOT ACT NOW AT THE STATE LEVEL. FROM 202-015-22018 AND FORCE WHEN ACTIONS FELL 80% AND AWARDS ASSOCIATED FELL 94%. THE FEDERAL CFPB HAS BEEN EVISCERATED OF ITS MISSION ITS IMPACT AND ITS RESOURCES. INSTEAD IT PROMOTES A CYNICAL PLAN TO PUT THE LARGEST BANKS FURTHER AHEAD OF THE PACK. AND IN BETTER POSITION TO ABUSING USE CUSTOMERS WHOM THEY SHOULD BE EMPOWERING. MOREOVER. EVEN THE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS OF FINES PAID BY THE TOP FIVE BANKS IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE RECESSION. MOSTLY FOR CREDIT CARD CONSUMER LOAN MORTGAGE LENDING VIOLATIONS DON'T STOP THE ABUSE. AS FOR THE BIGGEST BANKS IN THE SYSTEM AND THE TOP FIVE OF BANK OF AMERICA JP MORGAN CHASE CITIGROUP WELLS FARGO AND GOLDMAN SACHS. NOW EXCEED A COMBINED TOTAL OF MORE THAN NINE TRILLION IN ASSETS. THOSE FINES REPRESENT NEARLY A COST OF DOING BUSINESS SPARE CHANGE THEY COULD LOSE IN THEIR CAR OF AN AFTERNOON. ON THE CONTRARY IT IS LIKELY THAT EFFECTIVE REGULATION OF THE BANKS CONSUMER PRACTICES WILL NEED TO INCLUDE. POTENTIAL SUSPENSION OF BUSINESS LIFE LINE LICENSE OR EVEN REVOCATION OF FDI INSURANCE IN THE EXTREME. AS A RELATIVELY SMALL BANK IN THE SYSTEM WE IT BENEFICIAL STATE BANK NONETHELESS SEE WHAT GOES ON AROUND US AND IT'S STILL INCLUDES A PREPONDERANCE OF EXTRACTIVE PAYDAY LENDING. AUTO LOANS BANK PRODUCTS PRODUCTS OVERDRAFT PRACTICES MORTGAGE LENDING AND SMALL BUSINESS LENDING. AND FOR ALL OF THE SPEECHES CRIES OF OVER REGULATION AN AGENCY OVERLAP WE KNOW THAT EVERYONE IN AN INDUSTRY KNEW THAT WELLS FARGO WAS CROSS SELLING SIX TO EIGHT PRODUCTS. PER CUSTOMER EVEN THOUGH WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT FOR AND IRONICALLY HELD UP AS BEST PRACTICES FOR A DECADE. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE CFPB JOINED FORCES WITH THE LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY THAT JUSTICE WAS WROUGHT. IT IS NOW IT KNOWLEDGE WORLDWIDE THE TWIN PEAKS APPROACH TO BANK REGULATION IS NECESSARY. SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REGULATORS HAVE AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST HOLDING BANKS TO FULL ACCOUNTABILITY WITH REGARD TO CREATE DID TREATMENT OF CONSUMERS. WE CANNOT REALISTICALLY EXPECT THOSE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REGULATORS WHO OCCUPIED THREE FLOORS OF THE BANK'S HEADQUARTERS ON A PERMANENT BASIS. TO HANDLE POTENTIAL CONSUMER OF USES WE NEED A SEPARATE CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION FORCE IN THE MIX. AND WITH THE FEDERAL CFPB EVISCERATED THAT LEAVES THE DUTY TO THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ESPECIALLY AS WE HEAD INTO ANOTHER DOWNTURN WE NEED TO CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION REGULATORY PRESENCE IT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY SALUTARY FOR CALIFORNIA AS A LARGE STATE. THE FIFTH BIGGEST ECONOMYIN THE WORLD AND HOME OF WELLS FARGO AND FOR THE VIRTUAL HOME OF BANK OF AMERICA. IN ITS GLORY DAYS THE FORMER FORMER FEDERAL CFPB RETURN TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO AMERICANS ABOUT ONE EIGHTH OF WHICH WOULD HAVE GONE TO CALIFORNIANS. CREDIT CARD IMPROVEMENTS IN MORTGAGE MARKET CHANGES CONTINUE TO SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR. AND AVOIDING ANOTHER MELTDOWN IS PRICELESS. AND ALL OF THAT BENEFIT CAME AS SIGNIFICANT MULTIPLE OF WHAT HAD AT AS WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT BY THE CFPB. UNDER THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THE FOUR STATUTORY AREAS OVER WHICH THE CFPB HAD AUTHORITY HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY DISMANTLED OVER STUDENT SENIOR MILITARY AND PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THROUGH THE FAIR LENDING ACT. AND WE RECALL THAT BEFORE THE CFPB BANKS IN CALIFORNIA TRIED TO REST TO THIRTY FROM STATE REGULATORS IN FAVOR OF FEDERAL CONSTRAINTS THEY COULD GET AROUND. THIS RESULTED IN LOTS OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION THAT THE CFPB THEN FINALLY HAD THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE AND ENFORCE. LET US NOT ALLOW THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TURN ITS BACK ON ITS RESIDENTS WITH REGARD TO CONSUMER PROTECTION. AGAINST THE VERY BIGGEST BANKS AT UNDER PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES COMMIT FRAUD ON CONSUMERS LINDEN TO CLIMATE DISASTER AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE THEIR PUBLIC DUTIES. THE STAKES FOR OUR PEOPLE OUR COMMUNITIES OUR ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL TO THE STABILITY ARE TOO GREAT TO IGNORE. WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER WE ARE A BANK STAUNCHLY IN FAVOR OF A STATE CFPB THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO ALL THREE OF YOU. A SUMMER STONE. IN THEM I AM VERY HAPPY THAT THERE'S A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHO IS HERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HEAR. IN THE DISTRICT AS I TALK TO A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS IS FROM LOCAL BANKS THE SMALL CREDIT UNIONS AND SMALL LOCAL BANKS. AND WHAT THEY POINT OUT WHICH IS TRUE IS THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO LAND. IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE OTHERS ARE NOT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE COMMUNITY THEY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS THEY UNDERSTAND. HOW THOSE ECONOMIES AND WHERE THOSE THE ECONOMIES ARE WORKING AND THEY'RE CONSTANTLY ASKING? FOR A BIT OF A BREAK IN THE REGULATORY SCHEME BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM. A LARGER BANK CERTAINLY HAS THE CAPACITY BE ABLE TO MANAGE ALL THE REGULATIONS AND AND SO WITH SMALLER COMPANY SHOULD BUT BUT I THINK YOU RAISE. AN ISSUE THAT. THAT IS APPROPRIATE IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT DEREGULATING AND THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING BUT IT'S RETHINKING HOW WE REGULATE AND IF WE CAN CREATE A STRUCTURE THAT HAS AND THIS IS WHAT TO ME IS SO COMPELLING ABOUT THIS. TWENTY SIX NOTION. THAT WE HAVE A BANK REGULATOR BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION THAT'S LOOKING OUT ON THE CONSUMER SIDE WITH APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF POWERS. THEN I THINK THAT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO RETHINK HOW WE MANAGE THE SMALLER BANKS TO GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO WORK WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AS THEY KNOW HOW TO DO. BUT HAVE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF OVERSIGHT TO KEEP. TO AVOID THE TEMPTATIONS THAT THAT LEAD THEM ASTRAY AND WE CAN THEN SEPARATE THEM AND ALLOW THEM TO COMPETE. IN THESE MARKETS WITH SOME OF THE LARGER BANKS THAT THAT HAVE OFTEN FAILED WHEN IT COMES. TO WHAT'S LEFT TO SELF REGULATION AND AND LACK OF OVERSIGHT FROM A FEDERAL LEVEL AND OF COURSE WE CAN'T AFFECT FEDERAL LAW BUT WE CAN AFFECT AND CREATE STRUCTURES IN CALIFORNIA. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE STEPS THAT I THINK ARE POTENTIALLY VERY INTERESTING. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE A HEALTHIER CONVERSATION WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHO ARE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THINGS WORK. IN THEIR OWN AREAS BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF OVERSIGHT IN THOSE SITUATIONS -- FOR I THINK VERY OBVIOUS REASONS SO THIS. THIS IS A VERY EXCITING I THINK STEP OR GIVES A SOME POTENTIAL TO RETHINK. HOW WE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH RESPECT TO PROTECTING? OUR OWN CONSUMERS IN THE STATE AND REALLY. COULD SPUR A A WHOLE NEW FINANCIAL SECTOR AND THE THE FINTECH THE FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID. BUT I THINK SOMETHING TO BRACE BECAUSE WE ALL ARE MOVING TO FINANCIAL TOOLS AND BANKING RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE ONLINE THOSE AGAIN OUR OPPORTUNITIES BUT OPPORTUNITIES. WITHOUT OVERSIGHT FOR OTHER WAYS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS SOPHISTICATED TO GET INTO SOME SIGNIFICANT TROUBLE THAT SHOULD BE OUR CHARGE IS. TO PROVIDE THAT FRAMEWORK THAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT AND BE ABLE TO TEST IT AND THEN. INTEGRATIVE NEW BANKS WITH NEW STANDARDS CAN COME FORWARD INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES CAN COME FORWARD AND WE HAVE A VENUE TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE CONVERSATIONS RATHER THAN BEING STUCK IN AN OLD REGULATORY SCHEME. WITHOUT THAT HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW SOME OF THESE ADVANCES TO COME FORWARD REALLY THAT'S WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS A AND COULD BE. ON THE TABLE WITH HAVING APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF OVERSIGHT. BOTH ON THE AS A REGULATOR OF THE INSTITUTIONS BUT THEN SOMEBODY ELSE LOOKING OUT FOR THE VOICE OF CONSUMERS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND AND THEY ARE NOT. HURT BY BY THIS BECAUSE WE WE CAN HAVE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THAT. THE ENVIRONMENT THE ECONOMY AND INDIVIDUALS BUT NOT ALL ARE GOING TO BE THAT PLACER THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THERE. THEIR PRIMARY MOTIVATION BUSINESSES ARE IN BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE MONEY AND TO GROW THAT'S A LAUDABLE BUT WE NEED TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE ULTIMATELY. THE ONES THAT ARE FUNDING THAT AND THAT IS THEIR CUSTOMERS AND THOSE ARE OUR CONSUMERS. THIS IS THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING HEARING AND THE PERSPECTIVES I THINK OUR OUR EYE OPENING I KNOW WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT OF THIS TRACK. BUT I THINK THE LIVE THE CONVERSATIONS AND ESPECIALLY HAVING THE THIS LAST PANEL. HOPEFULLY HELP US FOCUS ON DIRECTIONS THAT WE COULD GO SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE AT FOR BRINGING THIS HEARING FORWARD AND REALLY YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA AS WELL HAS BEEN THAT SIGNIFICANT. IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT BANKING AND FINANCE IN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND AND WE HAVE A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES IN FRONT OF US. THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER SOUND THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS -- AND I AGREE I I THINK THAT THERE REALLY THIS CONVERSATION -- STARTED RATE LAST YEAR IN LOOKING AT SMALLER ELEMENTS AND NOW KIND OF PUTTING A PUZZLE TOGETHER OF LIKE WAIT A MINUTE WHAT WHAT DOES IT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR ENTIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PRODUCTS -- I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT ONE OF THE THINGS I MOST STRIVEN BY IN THIS PARTICULAR ROLE IS THE FACT THAT FINANCIAL. INSTITUTIONS AND PRODUCTS INFLUENCE AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS THERE IS NO DOUBT WHETHER THEY KNOW IT OR NOT AND USUALLY THEY ARE ON THE NOT SIDE -- AND AND THINK THAT. AS WE HAVE HEARD TODAY WE'VE TACKLED JUST A FEW TOPICS -- THAT RELATED. TO SCHOOL OF COURSE AS STUDENT DEBT -- SMALLER LENDING PAYDAY LENDING HIGH INTEREST LOANS -- AND ENFORCEMENT AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS PARTICULAR -- CONVERSATION IN THIS PARTICULAR HEARING THAT THIS ISN'T MEANT TO BE AND I GOT YOU FOR ANYONE IT'S MEANT TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT HELP AND NOT. HINDER THEM. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TACKLE -- WE CERTAINLY. HAVE A LOT IN FRONT OF US I IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION WE GO BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE LEGISLATIVE VEHICLES MOVING -- THROUGH THIS HOUSE -- THE AD THAT CAN HELP US ENSURE OUR WAY THERE -- SHOULD THERE BE LEGISLATIVE INTEREST AND I THINK THERE IS TO TRY TO GET US THERE I THESE ARE NOT NEW PROBLEMS. THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DEALT WITH -- IN SOME CASES IN TERMS OF THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES -- YOU KNOW FOR CENTURIES -- IN OTHERS THEIR BRAND NEW PRODUCTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR THESE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS -- THE FOR CONSUMERS THERE IS A ROLE FOR THESE PRODUCTS IN EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS LIE I'VE BUT WE WANT THEM TO BE HEALTHY PRODUCTS THAT HELP THEM PROSPER SO I APPRECIATE -- THE THREE OF YOU AT KIND OF LENDING YOUR VOICES -- IT TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. SO WITH THAT -- I AM GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU LIKE IF YOU IF YOU HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE -- WE HAVE TWO MINUTES PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION AND JUST REMEMBER YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES AB TAKE LESS THAN THAT MY NAME HAD MERMAN I RUN THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION -- AND IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS I WAS -- PART OF THE ENFORCEMENT TEAM IN THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE -- WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY THEN TO SEE WHAT THE LANDSCAPE LOOK LIKE WITHOUT. A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU WITHOUT A FEDERAL AGENCY THAT WAS DEDICATED TO CONSUMER PROTECTION PRIMARILY. AND IT WAS IT WAS A BARREN LANDSCAPE THERE'S A LOT OF AGGRESSIVE PREEMPTION -- TO THE POINT WHEN THE AGENCIES WOULD JUST SEND LETTERS TO COURTS AND SAY DON'T LISTEN TO WHATEVER THE AG HAS TO SAY -- TO TO HAVE A COMMITTEE. TO HAVE A LEGISLATURE DEDICATED TO THE IDEA OF ENHANCING. OUR THE AUTHORITY -- THE ROBUSTNESS OF STATE REGULATION. OF OF BANKS WOULD BE A REMARKABLE WE WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED WE RECOGNIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS WE APPROACHED. THE MORTGAGE CRISIS AND THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH THAT WE COULD DO TO STOP IT -- IF WE CAN CHANGE THAT IT WILL BE QUITE A CONTRIBUTION I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS ISSUE. AND IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS PUBLIC COMMENT JUST PLEASE LINE UP. THANK YOU AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KAREN SEDU AND I'M A POLICY COUNSEL AT THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING. A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO FIGHTING AGAINST PREDATORY LENDING. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF PASSING IN IMPLEMENTING HISTORIC LOWS IN ALMOST EVERY AREA PUBLIC POLICY THE STATE HAS BEEN A LEADER. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA FALLS BEHIND APPARENTLY EVEN BEHIND OFF OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS AND THE MOB. WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING BORROWS FROM PREDATORY LOANS? FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS PAYDAY LENDERS IN CALIFORNIA HAPPEN TRAPPING PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND LOW INCOME BORROWERS AND CYCLES OF DEBT. THE OFTEN LEAD TO KERR REPOSSESSION WAGE GARNISHMENT DAMAGE CREDIT AND EVEN BANKRUPTCY. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS THIS AFTERNOON THE CFPB RELEASED A ROLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO CRACKDOWN ON PAYDAY AND CAUGHT TITLE LOANS. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING THIS WILL AND IS STEPPING BACK FROM ENFORCING THE MILITARY LENDING ACT A LITTLE INTENDED TO PROTECT ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS FROM ABUSIVE LOAN PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT DEPEND ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT US FROM PREDATORY LENDERS WE NEED THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TO STEP UP AND LEAD ON THIS ISSUE. SIXTEEN STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE A 636% RATE CAPS THE PAYDAY LOANS AND THIRTY SEVEN STATES HAVE A RATE CAPS UNDER 36%. THE LARGER INSTALLMENT LOANS HOWEVER CALIFORNIA HAS NEITHER. THAT LEAVES STATES LIKE NEW YORK COLORADO ARKANSAS AND WEST VIRGINIA WITH STRONGER PLANETARY LANDING PROTECTION LAWS IN CALIFORNIA. FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE BORNE FORSMAN ACTIONS AGAINST PREDATORY LENDERS AND FIND THEM THE STEERING BAR LISTEN TO LOANS ABOVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WHERE THEY OPERATE WORRY FREE AS THERE IS NO INTEREST RATE CAP ON THIS ALL THE SPACE? IN A RECENT CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE THE COURT RULED THAT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR INSTALLMENT LOAN FROM CASH CALL. WITH A 98% APR MAY BE UNCONSCIONABLE. NOW LOCAL IT'S A TIME ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHAT LOANS SHOCK THE CONSCIENCE. THE CASH CALL CASE DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO FINALLY SET AN INTEREST RATE CAPS. WE APPLAUD THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHAT TO TAKE ON THIS ISSUE AND I THINK YOU. GRATEFULLY SYLLABUS ON BEHALF OF THE NEED US US THE NATION'S LARGEST LOOKING CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS -- JUST WANT TO SAY FIRST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BOTH OF THE BILLS THAT YES ARE CARRYING. ON THE FRONT OF STUDENT LOANS AND FOR SMALL DOLLAR LENDING FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY THIS IS YOU KNOW WHEN LOOKING OF FAMILIES DO WELL FINANCIALLY SORT OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE THINK THAT THESE ARE BIG STRIDES AND IMPORT CONVERSATIONS FOR US TO BE HAVING SO JUST EXPRESSING OUR GRATITUDE ON THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. AND SEE NO -- FURTHER AT COMMENTS -- PUBLIC COMMENT A DO AGAIN WANT TO THANK OUR PRESENTERS ON MISTER CORDRAY CHRIS AT PETERSON ASSET FRONTMEN SUSAN MARTINDALE SHARON VELASQUEZ CAT TAYLOR. I KNOW THAT THE CONVERSATION DOES NOT END HERE AS A MATTER OF FACT I I BELIEVE THAT TONIGHT AT THAT CAL STATE SACRAMENTO -- WITH THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA STUDIES I DOES HAVE A PANEL FROM FIVE THIRTY TO SEVEN PM AT THE SACRAMENTO STATE DOWNTOWN OFFICE I WITH THAT. MISTER CORDRAY AND MISC TAYLOR -- TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND I HOPE THE PUBLIC I WILL ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL. AND WITH THAT TO AND WE WILL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE TODAY'S HEARING
