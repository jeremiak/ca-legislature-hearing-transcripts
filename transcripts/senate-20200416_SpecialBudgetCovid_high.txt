THERE MAY BE SOME BLACK TIMES FOR DISTURBANCE IN A FEW TECHNICAL ISSUES AS WE'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCE AS WE PROCEED. BUT I HOPE TO ALL. BACK FULL. UNDER THE UNIX UNDER WHICH WE ARE TO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK. AND PATIENT AS WE PROCEED AHEAD. WITH THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FRAME THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COLD AT NINETEEN RESPONSE. AS THE BECAUSE RESULTED IN THE NEED FOR BOLDING UNPRECEDENTED ACTIONS IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. ON MARCH SIXTH THROUGH THE PASSAGES OF SB EIGHTY NINE THE LEGISLATURE GRANTED BROAD AUTHORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR TO SPEND UP TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR ANY PURPOSE RELATED TO THE CORONA BY. EMERGENCY GOVERNOR IS WERE THERE TO HELLO THIS THE LEAD. TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE OF WHICH I AM CHAIRWOMAN. AS THE ADMINISTRATION UTILIZES THIS FUNDING. AND OUR STAFF CAN REVIEWS OF EACH PROPOSAL TO THE ADMINISTRATION PROCEEDING. ALBEIT WITHIN A CONDENSED TIMELINE. HOWEVER AS MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES CONSISTENTLY HERE FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS ACROSS THE STATE IN OUR DISTRICTS OF THE SEVERE IMPACT OF THIS CRISIS AND AS. TO MEET OUR OST OF DEADLINE TO PASS A FOR TWENTY TWO ONE TO YEAR IT IS THE SENSE THAT WE A CALM. DISCUSSION AND THESE ARE THE THREE AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS TODAY'S HEARING ON. NUMBER ONE. THE USE OF THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO SB EIGHTY NINE. TO HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS UTILIZING OR INTENDS TO UTILIZE ITS AUTHORITY TO SPEND FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES FROM THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT. AND THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER STIPULATED HE INTENDS TO UTILIZE ANY OTHER LEGALLY AVAILABLE FUNDS. AND THREE HOW THE FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS INTERACT WITH OUR STATE RESPONSES AND FISCAL DECISIONS. I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THE WORK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DEVELOPING. IN REAL TIME TO CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THIS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HAPPEN NOT ECONOMIC PANDEMIC. FROM THE BUDGET COMMITTEES PERSPECTIVE IN PARTICULAR I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT FAN FINANCES WORKING TIRELESSLY AROUND THE CLOCK TO DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER STATE STRATEGIES IN RESPONSE TO THIS UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS. AT THE SAME TIME THERE FOR FEELING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN BUILDING E. SENSUALLY A NEW BUDGET FOR THE MAY REVISE. SO AGAIN I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE AND COMMEND THEM FOR ALL THEIR WORK DURING THIS SPEAKS ONLY CHILD. DAYS I'M SURE THAT COLLECTIVELY WE UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN OUR STATE AND HOW THESE RESOURCES ARE BEING DEPLOYED. WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THE WORK IS AHEAD OF US. AS THE LEGISLATURE ENGAGES IN THE PROCESS WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE WE ARE DOING ALL THAT WE CAN TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING THE IMPACT. OF NINETEEN ON OUR STATES READ. BUSINESS IS NOT. RELIGIOUS OR- AND LOCAL. FOR THIS HEARING EVER SEE NEW LETTERS AND EMAIL SYMPTOMS THE STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION AND AS TODAY'S HEARING IS TO GO THROUGH EACH AND VERY PATIENT IT IS AND- TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS THAT EXIST IN ORDER TO OF IN THE. WE ARE EMBARKING ON DIFFICULT FISCAL TIMES. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT. THANKS TO RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING STRATEGIES IT'S THE LAST RECESSION CALIFORNIA IS MUCH BETTER PREPARED THAN EVER TO ADDRESS. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. FINANCES THE BRUNT DOWNTURN A DECADE AGO IF WE HAVE EXPERIENCE AS- A BROUGHT DOWN TURN A DECADE AGO WE WOULD ALREADY BE OUT OF QUE IN FORCED INTO EXPENSE EXTERNAL WING. THE BUDGET CUTS. EVEN WARNS THAT THE PAYCHECKS. HOWEVER OUR PREPARATION WILL MOST IKELY NOT INSULATE US FROM ECONOMIC HARM COMING OUR WAY IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPS IN PROVIDE ENOUGH SUPPORT STATE. GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THREE. GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN THE BY PRESSING GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION HAVE REQUESTED IN WRITING. WELL TODAY FAR FISCAL CONDITION IS STABLE THE LEVEL OF INCREASE SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DETERMINE HOW LONG THAT REMAINS THE CASE AND HOW WELL WE WILL BE POSITION FOR.

GOOD AFTERNOON- GAVE PATRICK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S AND I WANT TO START BY SAYING. THANK YOU TO. YEAH YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR INVITING OUR OFFICE ARTIST EIGHT IN TODAY'S HEARING. WHO IS SEVEN THE HOST IF THEY COULD- ALLOW ME TO SHARE MY SCREEN- COULD WALK THROUGH MY SLIDES. JUST TO BEGIN ALL ALL MENTIONED THAT OUR OFFICE HAS ESTABLISHED A LANDING PAGE ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE A VARIETY OF POST. HOW THE RECENT COBIT NINETEEN RELATED FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT CALIFORNIA. AND IN ADDITION OUR OFFICE IS WORKING ON OUR ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OUTLOOKS WHICH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IN IN MAY SH. OKAY. SO WITH THAT I WILL MOVE TO THE FIRST SLIDE. AND YET HERE I WILL BEGIN BY ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC SITUATION. ARE THE PACE OF JOB LOSSES THAT WE ARE SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS. SB ABRUPT HALTING OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN SESSION IMPOSSIBLE. ON APRIL THIRD THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT US THAT THE US ECONOMY LAST SEVEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT ROLE JOBS. IN MARCH WE- INCREASED FROM THREE AND A HALF PERCENT TO FOUR POINT 4% THIS IS THE LARGEST ONE MONTH INCREASE IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. HE'S YEAR'S IS BAD AND THEY ARE NO DOUBT UNDER DATE THE EXTENT OF JOB LOSS THAT IS OCCURRING. IT'S MORE BASED ON A REFERENCE MARCH TWELFTH WHICH IS FAIRLY EARLY IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING PUT INTO PLACE. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET IS JUST HOW DEEP THE DOWNTURN WILL BE. HOW LONG LAST OR WHAT THE SHAPE OF THE RECOVERY WILL LOOK LIKE. BROADLY SPEAKING THERE ARE TWO WAYS THAT SEEM PLAUSIBLE. I'LL START WITH THE OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO HERE THE SHARP DOWNTURN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING NOW IS FOLLOWED BY SOME PERIOD OF TIME WE'RE ACTIVITIES. REST NATIONALLY IS FOLLOWED BY A PRONOUNCED REBOUNDED. EITHER LATER THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR YOU CAN YOU SHAPE TO THE CYCLE. THE NARRATIVE THAT WOULD ACCOMPANY THIS SCENARIO. WOULD BE THAT BECAUSE THE SHUTDOWN WASN'T ACTUALLY AND USE OF MEDICAL NECESSITY IS MORE IS MORE LIKELY THAT AND WILL BE ABLE TO BACK ONCE THE CHILDREN PLAY. THE REQUESTED. IN THE LAST THE MYSTICS AND RADIO THE RECOVERY WOULD HAVE MORE OF AN ILL SHAPE. WHERE THE VIRUS IS TO DISSIPATE THE DESK PAINTING THAT RESTRICTIONS REMAIN IN PLACE HOUSING ECONOMIC OUTPUT TO STAY DEPRESSED FOR LONGER. ENJOY OUR PROTRACTED IN AUGUST. THE WORST CASE. OF COURSE WOULD BE IF THE PANDEMIC SEEMED TO RECEDE. THE REST WERE LIFTED. IN AUGUST SEPTEMBER THE VIRUS CAME ROARING BACK CAUSING US TO HAVE TO RESTART HELLO OVER AGAIN. MAR READ THE- AND THAT WE SEE A YOU AND AT ALLOW. THE ECONOMIC OUTCOME LIKELY DEPENDS TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE VIRUS ITSELF. THE AMER BASELINE INSPECTION SEEMS TO BE THAT THE PANDEMIC WILL BEGIN TO RECEIVE SOME COMMENTS MONTHS. QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ON ACT ON OUR ACTIVITIES. ECONOMICALLY SPEAKING HOWEVER WE STILL WON'T BE IN THE CLEAR BECAUSE AT THAT POINT THE NORMAL RECESSIONARY FACT. OVER REALLY THESE ARE THE MAN AND THE INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS BOTH OF WHICH ARE COMMON IN THE WAKE OF. THESE THIS COURSE OF EVENTS WITH. THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE RANGE OF ANYWHERE FROM 923% BY THE FOURTH COOPER WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BE HIGHER BURKE AND REMAIN HILL EATING SOME AFTER. YOU CAN GRADUALLY OFFICE SEEM. SOME VERSION OF THIS. THE US UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD STILL BE A 9% AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TURNING TO SPECIFICALLY THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT DATA FOR MARCH ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE BUT RECENT CLAIMS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM SUGGEST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWELVE AND THREE. RENDON SAID NOW LOST. SO TOUCH ON WHAT THIS COULD MEAN FOR SOME OF THE KEY SECTORS IN THE STATE. THIRTEEN ANY ACCOMMODATIONS AND FOOD WHICH INCLUDES RESTAURANTS BARS OTHER KINDS OF TRAVEL RELATED LEISURE SERVICES AND THIS IS A MATTER. THESE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR A MAJORITY OF THE NATIONAL JOB LOSSES THAT WE SIGNED MARCH. IN MARCH THEY'RE BEING HIT VERY HARD BY THE DROP OFF IN TOURISM. AND IS THAT CONSUMERS ARE YOU MORE CAUTIOUS GOING FOR THIS SECTOR MAY BE SLOW TO RECOVER. AND SINCE THERE LOWMARGIN BUSINESSES TO BEGIN WITH WE COULD SEE AN INCREASE IN BANKRUPTCIES AMONG THESE FIRMS LATER IN THE YEAR. THERE'S A SIMILAR CITY. AMONG RETAILERS IN. ESPECIALLY THE BRICK AND MORTAR STORE FRONTS THEY'RE THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE HIT VERY HARD AND- WILL RECOVER FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS AS TO THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS HAVE A SLIDE FOR EVERY POINT. YESTERDAY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT RETAIL SALES FELL BY BY- 9% ON A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED BASIS IN MARCH THAT WAS THE SINGLE. BEST ONE MY- AB THAT REPORTED SINCE AND TRACKING MISSTATED IN. NINETY TWO. IN CONSTRUCTION WE SEE A SECTOR THAT IS VERY SENSITIVE TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ACTIVITY HAS ALREADY BEEN IN CONSISTENT OVER THE PAST YEAR. WELL AFTER THAT I PLANNED PROJECTS WE'RE- BOTH THE MAN BEGAN FINANCING FOR NEW PROJECTS WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED. THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR MAYBE ONE AREA SILVER LINING. BECAUSE IT COULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED DEMAND. THEN WE SEE FOR YOU KNOW TECH DATA TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT SUPPORT TELECOMMUTING PROMOTE EDUCATION. AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT MANY OF THE EARNED ALREADY CAN SUPPORT A REMOTE WORKING OF COURSE. SH SO- WITH THAT I'LL I'LL MENTION THE RESPONSE THEY WERE SEEN HERE- THE FIRST IS THAT THE- USING THE- WE WANTED TO JUST MENTION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MORE THAN EIGHT. HE HE WITH THE FISCAL CAPACITY IN THE INSTITUTIONAL WE WAY TO RUN DEFICITS WHICH ENABLE IT TO REPLACE A MEANINGFUL PORTION OF THE AGGREGATE SHORTFALL AND THAT WERE SEEN. THE ADEQUACY OF THE FEDERAL RESPONSE MAY IN FACT PROVE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CASE OF THE INITIAL ECONOMIC. WE SEE. ON THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE CORONA VIRUS AID RELIEF AND ECONOMIC SECURE ACT THE CHAIRS ACT THE PACKAGE WAS HISTORIC BOTH IN ITS SIZE IT TWO POINT TWO TRILLION WHICH IS EQUAL TO AROUND 10% US GDP. ALSO THE REPEATEDLY WITH WHICH WAS ENACTED. JUST WISHING INCLUDED SOME POLICIES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE QUITE HELPFUL SUCH AS THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM AND EXPANDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS. STILL IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN THAT MORE ACTION WILL BE NEEDED WELL THE PACKAGE PROVIDES SUPPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES IT LEAVES OUR SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED DATE TO CERTAIN HORRIBLE DELUSIONS OF SECULAR I DON'T THINK THE DOCUMENTED RESIDENTS IN I. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN AID STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SEE THEM YEAH WITH THE DIRECT COSTS OF RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ABOUT FIFTEEN POINT THREE BILLION THIS WITH SIX OR SEVEN BILLION THAT GOING TO LOCAL. HOWEVER THE SEVERITY OF THE DOWNTURN. THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT MORE MORE AID IS NECESSARY AND IN PARTICULAR IF THEY CAN BE DELIVERED THROUGH THE STATE. THEY ARE GOOD VEHICLE FOR GETTING ME. IN LARGE MONEY AN INMATE IN A RELATIVELY QUICK FASHION AND I'M- AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS RECENTLY MADE A REQUEST- DISCRETIONARY AID WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL. SO FINALLY MOVING TO THE STATE'S FISCAL OUTLOOK ON THE THIRD SLIDE. AT THIS POINT WE THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THE STATE IS GONE FROM AN ANTICIPATED SURPLUS IN NOW FACING LIKELY FACING A BUDGET PROBLEM AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT WHAT. UNDER WHEN WE SAY BUDGET PROBLEM WE ARE REFERRING TO SITUATION WHERE THE STATE'S REVENUES PLUS IT'S DISCRETIONARY RESERVES ARE INSUFFICIENT COVERAGE EXISTING SERVICE LEVEL. REALISTICALLY IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS FOR US TO GET A CLEAR IDEA OF THE BUDGET SITUATION. PART OF THIS IS THE NEW TO THE INTERNET YOUR DISCOUNT. THE DOWNTURN HAS IN CERTAIN IN RECENT AND BY OCCURRING IN THE SPRING IT MEANS WE ARE FINALIZED. IT'S WITH. A SURE. MORE TAX FIVE DATE WAS PUSHED JULY IN WALL WAS IT APPROACH WEIGHT BUY RELIEF TO TACK IT DOES COMPLICATE OUR DEDUCTIBLE NEIGHBOR LAST YEAR REVENUE S. SO YEAH. FOR THE DURATION OF THIS DOWNTURN PAST EXPERIENCE DOES SUGGEST TO US THE SCHOOL TAX WILL BE SEARCHED FOR SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES. AND AS A REMINDER THAT GREAT. I THINK WE ENDED IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND NINE BUT THE STATE WAS STILL GRAPPLING WITH BUDGET PROBLEMS. TWELVE AND THIRTEEN. NOW WE HAVE INCLUDED RECESSION SCENARIOS IN OUR NOVEMBER FISCAL OUTLOOK IN RECENT YEARS IN THIS PAST YEAR AND IN NOVEMBER WE LOOK AT IT WAS SORT OF FULLER THIRTY TODAY BRIDGE POST WORLD WAR TWO SESSION UNDER THESE CAN. WE ESTIMATED IN THE FOR YEAR REVENUES WOULD BE TO. LAST PRAYER BACK THREE. BUT THERE'D STILL BE A NOT THIRTY BILLION. LOS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SO FOR THAT THAT'S FOR A TOTAL OF FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. AND UNFORTUNATELY PRELIMINARY INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE REVENUE LOSSES IN THE CURRENT DOWNTURN COULD BE WORSE IN THIS. CENTURY ON A PAR WITH THE TYPE OF DOWNTURN WE SAW IN THE GREAT RECESSION. THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH A THIRTY FIVE. REVENUE SHORTFALL THE FIRST YEAR IN. ADDITIONAL EIGHTY FIVE BILLION REVENUE SHORTFALL IN THE YEARS. AFTER SO THE BUDGET PROBLEMS OF THIS MAGNITUDE WERE TO EMERGE THEY WOULD EXCEED THE STATE'S RESERVES WHICH WE ESTIMATOR CURRENTLY AT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF BILLION. ALL THE STATE. WE ON TRACK THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH. RESERVES OF ALMOST TWENTY ONE BILLION THIS FIGURE- ARRESTED NOT A LOT OF IT HAS COME DOWN SOMEWHAT SINCE THE ONSET OF THE VIRUS AND THE STATE'S RESPONSE. THE PROBLEM HE LARGE AND WILL LAST LONGER. WE RECOMMEND THE JUNE YOU OF THE- AT LEAST AT FIRST UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE REVENUE PICTURE WILL BE. PRACTICE ONE APPROACH YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WOULD BE TO BE GET IT'S CUT BUDGET CONVERSATION GOING BACK TO NOTION OF BASELINE. WE NOW MAY MAKE IT EASIER TO ADDRESS. PROBLEM DOES EMERGE LATER THIS SUMMER. AND TO ASSIST YOU WITH THAT WE'RE SETTING ASIDE MUCH OF THE WHAT HAD BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FROM JANUARY THROUGH APRIL TO DEVELOP ESTIMATES OF THE BASELINE BUDGET AS IT WOULD BE TO. SHE COULD THINK OF. SURE THIS. UPDATING OUR BASELINE BUDGETING. WHEN I SAY BASS LINE I MEAN IS THE COST OF THE CONCERT. ACCOUNTING FOR REVISED CASELOAD ESTIMATES ANY INCREASES IN MANDATORY EXPENDITURES ACROSS THE RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION POSSIBLY JUST MEN'S NOT JUST. SO AS YOU CAN SEE FROM WHAT I JUST SAID THAT THE CONCEPT OF A BASELINE- WORKLOAD BUT IS OPEN TO SOME INTERPRETATION. THEREFORE MISSION THIS WE'RE ALL WELL IT BEING SORT OF A BASS LINE. LOW ESTIMATE. WHAT THE COST WOULD BE IN OTHER WORDS. WHAT WOULD BE. THE COST TO IN THE BUDGET TO MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS TO STILL MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS BUT WITHOUT FULLY FUNDED ALL THE- SCHOOL THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE INCLUDED. PACIFIC ECONOMIST FLAT FOR EXAMPLE OR PULLING BACK GRANT ST HAVE YET BEEN AWARDED OR REDUCING NONESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT CAPITAL OUTLAY X. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE LOW. HELLO LOWERING THE BAIT AND WOULD LOOK LIKE. SO I'LL KNOW I'M INCLUDING HERE THAT BEFORE HE DOES THE BALANCE REQUIREMENT SO THIS. THE STATE'S ABILITY FOR ECONOMIC IN THE WAY THAT THE FOR I CAN. AND AFTER HAVING LEARNED SOME TOUGH LESSONS IN THE LAST RECESSION THE STATE ENTERED AS ONE ON MUCH BETTER FISCAL TWENTY. SO THE CAR SHOULD BE SIGNED BUDGET MIGHT BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS THE STATE CAN PROMOTE POLICIES THE BILL TACTICS EXIST IN STATE PROGRAM. NEVER ANSWERED SHE- ALWAYS OUR OFFICE WILL BE STANDING BY. READY TO ASSIST YOU AS YOU THROUGH THAT AND THAT IN THE COMING WEEKS NINE. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER PATRICK AND AS ALWAYS TO THE BUDGET PROCESS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR- RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU THE LA ON ALL THE ALISON YOUR UTENSIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN CALL X.

TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARINGS MY REMARKS TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE STATE'S OPTIONS FOR HOW IT RESPONDS THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE CRISIS WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THOSE CALIFORNIANS WERE MOST AFFECTED AT SEVERAL LIKE WEEKS AGO WE OUTLINED A SET OF PRINCIPLES FOR HOW THE STATE RESPONDS THE FIRST OF THOSE IS TO MAXIMIZE. WE CAN MAXIMIZE IMPACT ADMITTEDLY WITH CONSTRAINED RESOURCES ARE RECOGNIZING THE FISCAL REALITIES OUTLINED BY THE LA- BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THE STATE. MUST STILL SET PRIORITIES FOR ITS SPENDING IN WAYS THAT WILL HELP COMBAT THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CRISIS. AND THAT MEANS ARE PROVIDING WELL TARGETED RELEASED BY WRAPPING AROUND CURRENT INVOLVING FEDERAL FISCAL RELIEF TO FILL IN THE GAPS ARE PRIORITIZING THE NEEDS FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED AND HELP IN THE CALIFORNIANS WHO. WON'T BE REACHED BY EXISTING SYSTEMS. ENSURING THAT THE RELIEF IS ALSO TIMELY AND RECOGNIZES THE LENGTH OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WILL ALSO BE IMPORTANT THERE IS BOTH AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR IT A RELIEF BUT THERE'S ALSO A NEED. FOR POLICIES THAT PROVIDE RELIEF BEYOND WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW GIVEN THAT IT APPEARS THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE CRISIS ECONOMIC CONTINUE BEYOND. THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS AND THAT MOST OF THE FEDERAL RELIEF COULD RUN OUT FOR ECONOMY HAS RECOVERED. WE RELEASED A SERIES OF BRING FOR PORTS EXAMINING WHO ARE THE WORKERS MOST AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE CRISIS INCLUDING TWO FACTIONS RELEASED THIS MORNING COMBINED THOSE ON OUR- OCTOBER NINETEEN PAGE ON OUR WEBSITE A CAL BUDGET CENTER AND WORK WE'VE DONE PREVIOUSLY IS THAT MOST.

OF THE KEY GAS IN THE CURRENT AND INVOLVING FEDERAL FISCAL REALLY AFFECT UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT FUTURE FEDERALLY FOR CONTINUE TO LEAD THESE GAPS MAKING IT EVEN MORE IMPERATIVE THE CALIFORNIA AS A STATE TAX REBATE REBATES NOTABLY EXCLUDED UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS. WITH FEDERAL IDENTIFICATION TAX ART BUT WITH I'M SORRY WITH FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ARE AYE TENS AND REQUIRE THAT EVERYONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS IN OTHER WORDS IS OF THE RED REBATES ARE NOT AVAILABLE NEXT STATUS FAMILIES. WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE STATE CAN AND SHOULD ADDRESS THE EXCLUSION BY PROVIDING EMERGENCY AID DISTRIBUTED EITHER THROUGH LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE COUNTY SOCIAL SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES. AND PROVIDE A STATE CREDIT OR REBATES TO THE CALATHEA ATC AND YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT RIGHT TEN PILAR'S. AND WE THEREFORE APPLIED THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY THAT THE STATE WILL PROVIDE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO COME FROM AND TO BE A ONE TIME CASH ASSISTANCE FRIEND DOCUMENTED ADULT. THAT ASSISTANCE IS MUCH NEEDED AND IT WILL START TO HELP TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE IMPACTS OF THE CRISIS. BUT WE ALL ALREADY KNOW THAT THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT IS GREATER AND THE NEED IS GREATER AS WELL AND AS I NOTED EARLIER IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF A CRISIS WILL CONTINUE BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE AREA. I'M NOT BE A NEED FOR ASSISTANCE BEYOND. TODAY'S NEED. THAT MEANS THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER BUILDING OFF OF THE GOVERNOR'S INITIAL PROPOSAL BY BUILDING ON THE CALORIE I. T. C. AND THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT TO INCLUDE I. TEN PILAR'S. INCREASING THE COST I AM SORRY INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE CREDIT. FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE RECEIVING SMALL AMOUNTS UNDER THE WAY THOSE CREDITS STRUCTURE CURRENTLY. AS TODAY'S EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DALY REVEAL THEIR ALSO CONTINUE NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE ALREADY HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN OUR STATE. FEDERALLY IF IT'S HELPFUL BUT IT NOTABLY EXCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. IN THE STATE TO PROVIDE ITS OWN UNEMPLOYMENT. BUT WAGE REPLACEMENT BY AND- PROVIDE WE CLEAR LUMP SUM PAYMENTS TO THOSE. WHOSE WORK AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR INSURANCE. ANOTHER WAY TO HELP UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE. WHICH IS PIVOTAL TO THEIR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO BOTH THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE CRISIS. WE APPLAUD THE STATE'S NEW POLICY ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THAT ALLOWS EVERYONE ROLLED MEDI CAL INCLUDING AN ACCURATE IMMIGRANTS TO RECEIVE NO COST OVER NINETEEN. STING IMPROVEMENT BUT OVERALL MOST UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS STILL LACK. I HEALTH COVERAGE IN THE STATE COULD CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THAT ARENA. THERE ARE OTHER GAPS IN THE FEDERAL FISCAL RELIEF THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WAYS OF THE STATE MY RESPOND THE ADDITIONAL PAID LEAVE PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL RELIEF INCLUDES IN EXCLUDES EMPLOYERS OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. 44% OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE FOR MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION WORKERS THAT MEANS ADDITIONAL WORK PROTECTED LEAVE. INDIVIDUALS AND PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARING FOR CHILDREN OR ADULTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF FACILITIES THAT COULD BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS THIS GOES ON. CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN RELIGIOUS FOR CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE DELIVERED. THE FEDERAL CCTV G. PROGRAM BUT WE KNOW THE MOST CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BEEN FORCED TO TEMPORARILY CLOSED MANY ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND THAT CARE. AND THEY'LL BE A CONTINUED NEED IN THAT ARENA GOING FORWARD. AND LASTLY IN THEIR IN HOPE IN THAT IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS. FEDERAL RELIEF PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING EMERGENCY GRANTS ASSISTANCE AND THERE MAY BE MORE FEDERALLY IT'S WORTH COMING. BUT WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY DEALING WITH THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND MANY MORE PEOPLE WILL NOW BE AT RISK OF FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS. BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY TEN ZERO CRISIS THE STATE REQUIRES A RESPONSE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE. FUNDING FOR LOCAL CURRENCY. IT IS A- STABILITY FOR THE RAY OF METERS AND SUPPORTS. IN CLOSING I CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC POLICY RESPONSES TO FOCUS ON TARGETED AND WELL TIMED ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF WORKERS AND FAMILIES WERE MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED LEAST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO HELP. ME HELP BY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS AND SUPPORTS AND MOST AT RISK OF I'M TERM ECONOMIC AND SECURITY THOSE EFFORTS WILL PAY OFF IN THE BEEN PROVIDING ECONOMIC SECURITY AND STABILITY OF THE HIGH CRISIS HELP STIMULATE THE STATE'S ECONOMY THEREAFTER I'M SURE THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO WILL SAY THAT. FOR THESE SORTS OF TARGETED IN. WE RECOGNIZE IT RESOURCES WILL BE CONSTRAINED AND THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING. I'D OUTLINED A FEW THINGS HERE THAT WE THINK ARE HIGH NEED OPTIONS AND WE SUBMIT THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO NOTHING BUT YOU GET A LITTLE. LONGER TERM COST TO OUR STATE ITS ECONOMY AND ITS PEOPLE WILL FAR OUTWEIGH THE SHORT BUDGETARY US. IT HAS SHOWN IT CAN WHETHER DOWNTURNS IN THE FISCALLY PRUDENT. THE BILL RESERVES TO PREPARE FOR FUTURE NEEDS. POLICY MAKERS CAN LEAD THE STATE FORWARD AGAIN BY ENSURING THAT CHILDREN FAMILIES AND WORKERS THE HARDEST NOW. AND OUR ECONOMY OVERALL DON'T PAY THE PRICE OF THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC FOR YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING QUESTIONS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE BOTH A- BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER IS ALL THE LA- FOR IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES WE MIGHT CONSIDER AS WELL AS- IDENTIFYING GAPS IN FUNDING AND SUPPORT THUS FAR WE APPRECIATE YOU- CHRIS BEFORE WE MOVE ON WOULD YOU MIND GIVEN THE- UP. BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER WEBSITE ONE MORE TIME. THAT YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR THAT'S CAL BUDGET CENTER DOT ORG THANK YOU EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR COLLEAGUE YOU'RE GONNA TRANSITION NOW- INTO OUR OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS I'M GOING TO START WITH A FEW JUST TO. SET THE STAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT KIND OF THE FOCUS IN THE INTENT OF TODAY'S HEARING ALL OF THE IN A TODAY SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING IS NOT. FULL EXPANSIVE- REVIEW OF THE OVERALL BUDGET BUT REALLY IS FOCUSED ON THE THREE THINGS IDENTIFIED DURING OUR- UNDER MY OPENING STATEMENT SO BY MAY BEGIN. I WANT TO ASK THE FINANCE. IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU AND THE LA YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL LIKELY FACE A BUDGET CHALLENGE AS A RESULT OF THIS PANDEMIC I WONDER IF YOU CAN BEGIN BY TELLING US IF YOU BEGUN TO SEE IN THE IMPACT TO OUR COLLECTIONS ARE. WHERE DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE COMPARED TO THE JANUARY REVENUE PROJECTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS THAT THIS CRISIS IS COME ABOUT OF COURSE IT'S BEEN IN THE MAKING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THANKS THE IMPACT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS SO CITING THAT THE MOST RECENT DATA. WE HAVE. EVEN THE INCLUDING- SUMMER UNEMPLOYMENT WE ARE ALSO. NUMBER OF CLAIMS INCREASE EVERY WEEK BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CASH COLLECTIONS JOBS REPORTS THE BEST EVIDENCE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS ACTUALLY MOSTLY CREE CRISIS AND SO COMING INTO THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY DECLARATION ON MARCH INSTEAD WORRY AT THIS POINT WE WORK SEVEN EIGHT MONTHS INTO THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IT'S JUST GOING YEAR. PERSONAL INCOME TAX CASTLE PORTIONS WERE ACTUALLY RUNNING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OVER IN ABOUT THE TWENTY NINETY BUDGET AX FORECAST YEAH AND SALES TAXES AND CORPORATE TAXES WERE LITTLE MORE NEUTRAL BUT WE WERE RUNNING OUT OF NOT WORK. COMES TO THOSE. MY YOUR MENTIONING WE EXPECT TO SEE THAT AND DATA SOON BUT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I THINK ONE OTHER THING PUBLIC ALL BASED ON THE- REESE. IS THAT BOTH THE FEDERAL GOT. AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO. ACTION FOR MOST TAXED. LAST FROM APRIL SIXTEENTH CONSOLE JULY. AND THEN THERE SOME RELIEF NICE WITH TO SELL STOCK FOR SMALL AS WELL SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE ANXIOUS A PRETTY STEEP DECLINE IN THE CAST WE'RE COLLECTING OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS OF COURSE THAT CASH WILL COME BACK BY JULY FIFTEENTH. SENATOR DAN WHAT. THERE ARE. GETTING OUR- BUDGETARY PROJECTION FOR THE NAY REVISION AND ASK FOR THE OP COMING FISCAL YEARS AND IN ADDITION. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NAME IS XIN ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO MONITOR CáC. GEN AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE A QUESTION- BETWEEN NOW AND- YOUR- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FINANCE- YOU TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR A YEAR YOUR CURRENT ESTIMATE BEING OF ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR IN STATE EXPENDITURES TO COMBAT CALL THAT TEAM- MY QUESTIONS WILL ALL THIS FUNDING BE DONE THROUGH THE SECONDARY FIX PROCESS. BUT HELLO BY THIS. THIS IS OF A PROCESS QUESTION WHAT CAN WE ANTICIPATE AS THE LEGISLATURE. NICE GOING DOLLAR FIGURE AS DISCUSSES UNCERTAIN SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE AS WE HAVE MORE CLARITY OF WHAT THE LEVEL OF THOSE EXPENDITURES ACTUALLY WILL BE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT AND THEN NOW IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AS YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKING. EXPENDITURES OUT OF PROCREATION MONEY NASTY EIGHTY NINE LOS SP ONE SEVENTEEN AND THE TRIO. WHEN IT TO THAT REVISION- THEN WILL FOUR ACCOUNTING TERMS THAT HOW RECEIVED AT THAT POINT AS WELL AS A SENSE OF HOW WE WILL BE ALLOCATING SOME OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS COMING IN. WERE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE REIMBURSEMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA JACKSON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE COST SHARE AND WITH EACH PASSING WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AS WELL. TO SEE TIME. AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE WILL HAVE. WORKS FULL SEVEN GOING OR WHATEVER IT NEXT YEAR ALSO WE WILL BE JUST THE OF STREET SMARTS WILL. BUT CERTAINLY IS THE CASE THAT. THE NEIGHBOR WE'RE GONNA BE PUTTING OUT BUDGET PLANS FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR. BASED LINE BY BY WHICH FOR TWO WEEKS FOR THE PLACES WE INVEST FOR RESPONSE TO WORK GOING TO GET THE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AT THAT TIME AND OF COURSE IF THIS THING JANET JACKSON TO USE THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER WHICH IS MY YOU KNOW WE MIGHT NEED TO DO SOME. WORK WITH SELECT. OUR SHE'S. THANK YOU THISMY LAST QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER THIS ONE OFF AND ON THE MOVE ON TO THE LA IF WE HAVE TO YOU LAW THE RAINY DAY FUND COULD YOU WALK OF THROUGH WHAT ARE THE AND PROCESS YOU LIE THE RESERVE. YES SO I'M HAPPY TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS AND THEN I KNOW LA- MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS AS WELL SO BASICALLY THE RAINY DAY FUND IS STUFF FROM THE BY. PROPOSITION TWO WHICH LETTERS ARE. BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT WAS ENACTED BY THE VOTERS NUMBER OF TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND BASICALLY THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT. THE FUNDS IN THE RAINY DAY FUND AND WE SPEND MANDATORY DEPOSITS IN THERE WHICH IS THE MAJORITY. RENDON RAINY DAY SIGNS CANNOT BE. ON NUMBER ONE AT THE RISK. MERGING YOU WOULD IS DECLARE BY I GOT ARTS AND I INCLUDES SOME SWITCH. DISASTER PERIL FOREST. IN WHICH REVENUES COMING IN ALLOW LEVEL THE LAST. FOUR YEARS AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS NOT TO APPROPRIATE FROM. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO TAKE ACT. AND THE THIRTEEN THING TO. IS THAT THE COMPOSITION TWO INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT ONLY HALF OF THE AVAILABLE SIGNS. IN THE RAINY DAY FUNDS CAN BE WITHDRAWN IN A GIVEN. YEAR AND HE SAID THAT- THE REASON THAT PROVISION EXISTS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT TIME ISN'T SIMPLY AND- ALL FROM FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN YOU'RE LEFT WITH NOTHING IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF WHATEVER RECESSION OR CRISIS YOU'RE DEALING WITH EXTENDS BEYOND THE FIRST THE SCHOOL YEAR AND I STAYED WITH THE LA- MENTION. THERE'S A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY WITH THIS CRISIS THAT WE WILL SEE THE IMPACT NOT ONLY IN THE CURRENT YEAR NOT ONLY. YOUR AFTER BASS AND EIGHTY EVEN HERE. THAT SO- THAT IS A- KAPLAN TERMS IS THAT AND HOW THAT CAN BE APPROPRIATED- BUT THE ACTUAL NOW WILL BE BASED ON ACT DISCUSSION. RATIONS AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN I THINK YEAH. ONE OTHER POINT I'LL MAKE ON THE- RAINY DAY FUND IS THAT I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S YOUR MOUNTAIN THE RAINY DAY SIGNED IT'S- UP TO PROJECTIONS THE ACTUAL NINE RAINY DAY FUND. WAITING TO SOME COMP TIME. DON'T YOU WAIT. THAT ARE BASED IN PROPOSITION TWO KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEIGHBOUR BASED. WE WILL HAVE. ASKED IN THE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE LEVEL AND THAT'S- ACTS WILL BE FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR. IN A WILL FINALLY AGAIN WITH REGARD TO THE TRAIL ACCOUNT COULD YOU TALK TO A SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE WHAT WHAT THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IS BEING UTILIZED FOR. AND IF YOU INTEND TO TRANSFER ADDITIONAL FUNDS INTO THE ACCOUNT. WE KNOW THAT ONE TRANSFER IS TAKING PLACE DO YOU INTEND TO DO MORE. YES IT IS TRANSFERRING TO RESET MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK UP A LITTLE MORE IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS FROM THE TRAILER TRANSFER BUT THAT TRANSFER WAS FOR. PROTECTIVE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT RELATED FOR THE FROM THE NINETEEN EMERGENCY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GIVEN THE RECORD OF THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AS SAYING ON THAT UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACCESS RESPONDING TO THIS CRISIS WE MAY NEED TO TAX ANY LEGALLY AND IT PULLS. MAY% TWENTY IT'S NOT FAR. IN THE THREE OUR ACCOUNT IN ORDER RESPOND. EMERGENCY IN REAL TIME. THE ACTING NO ONE WE WILL MAKE SURE. NOTIFICATION OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A THREE HOUR STATUTES AND THEN SECOND IN THE NAY REVISION- WHEN IT COMES TO ANY TRANSFERS THE ON. THAT INITIAL ONE POINT THREE OR ONE PRICE FOR THAT UNITED STATES MAKING SURE THAT WE SQUARE THAT UP IN OUR NEIGHBOR. SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EXCEPT THE BROADER FISCAL. IN WHICH THAT. AT UP MISTER. QUICK FOR PLEASE SIR. YOU KNOW WE'VE- BEEN APPROPRIATELY BUILDING RESERVES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AS WELL AS WE PAY DOWN DEBT INCURRED FROM- THE GREAT RECESSION ABOUT A DECADE AGO- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES USERS OF THE STATE MAY HAVE. ACCESS TO THAT WE- HOPE WE PROTECT PROGRAM AND SERVICE LEVELS WITHOUT HAVING TO CUT. MANAGER BUT IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT THAT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE- THE STATE HAS. TO PAY DOWN VARIOUS KINDS OF BUDGETARY DEBT THAT WERE ACCUMULATED DURING THE CRIER BUDGET CRISIS OF THE THAT THAT STEM FROM THE GREAT RECESSION. THERE ARE GENERALLY THREE OR FOUR MAIN AVENUES THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER. ONE ONE OF THEM WOULD BE WILL FUNDS FROM OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS OF THE STATE. NOW THERE'S PROBABLY TEN BILLION ACCUMULATED BALANCES AND THE OTHER NON GENERAL FUND FUNDS OF THE STATE ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THAT IS AVAILABLE IT IS ONE SOURCE OF BUT- SOLUTION THAT COULD HELP WITH THAT. BUDGET PROBLEM. AS AS MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE STATE ALSO DURING THE PRIOR. THE BUDGET CRISIS USED- DEFERRALS AND YOU KNOW SORT OF A SHIFTING PAYMENTS FROM ONE PERIOD OF TIME TO A LATER PERIOD OF TIME BUT I DON'T LIKE WIZARDS THOSE OFFER ONE TIME SORT OF BUDGETARY BENEFIT TO HELP WITH IMMEDIATE BUDGET PROBLEM. AND THEN- FINALLY THERE CAN BE. SOME SOME USE OF FUN SHIPS FUNDS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY USED IN ONE WAY CAN BE SHIFTED OVER TO HELP THE GENERAL FUND FOR A TIME AND I JUST MENTION THAT ALSO A MAJOR A MAJOR THIS. FORM OF ASSISTANCE ACTUALLY COMES FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT REALLY ONE THAT YOU HAVE. HE TO DICTATE WHAT THEY- I HAVE EIGHT OR LEVEL OF A THEY PROVIDE BUT THAT IS ALSO BEEN AND OTHER SOURCE OVER THE YEARS THAT IS HELP THE STATE WHEN THERE'S BEEN A NATIONAL RECESSION. THANK YOU MISTER THIS WILL OFTEN DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION OR SHOWING MOVE ON. I THINK ALL DAY TO MOVE ON-THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT- AT THIS TIME- WE'RE GONNA. TURN TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO ASK QUESTIONS SO FAR I HAVE Q. THAT. WHAT MISTER MOORE LAW ONE SECOND MR MORE LIKE WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE NEXT AND SENATOR NIELSEN AND ADDING YOU TO THE LIST WELL BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO MIND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT AT THE POINT IN TIME WE GO BACK TO OUR WEEK AT THE END OF THE ROOM THE PUBLIC CONTRA I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE- AND- CO GET YOUR ACCESS TO IT. PHONE ONE. EIGHT. TO TWO SIX EIGHT TWO ONE SIX AND WHEN PROMPTED THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE FIVE NINE THREE TWO NINE FIVE AGAIN. ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN TWO TWO SIX EIGHT TWO ONE SIX. THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE FIVE NINE THREE TWO NINE FIVE. WE'LL BEGIN WITH SENATOR MORE LOCK. SENATOR MORE LOCK WHEN YOU BEGIN IF YOU WOULD PLEASE IDENTIFY WHO YOU'RE DIRECTING THE QUESTION TO JUST SELL THE I. T. TEAM HERE WIL BE READY THAT WHEN YOU'RE DONE TO SWITCH DIRECTLY TO THE PERSON YOU'D% LIKE TO HAVE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FAIR ENOUGH. AS YOU WISH MANAGER THANK YOU SIR PROCEEDS. MANAGER LIKE TO DIRECT MY FIRST QUESTION TO MISTER CRADDICK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. I THANK YOU RELEASED A REPORT ON APRIL STEP. THE STATE BUDGET FACTS OF RECENT FEDERAL ACTIONS REGRESS NINETEEN AND ON PAGE TWO DO YOU TALK ABOUT A HIGHER DRIVER COSTS HIGHER. HIGHER DIRECT. INDIRECT US IN THE LOWER REVENUES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND I'M I'M WONDERING SINCE YOU DIDN'T MENTION CALPERS YOUR CAL STARS IF YOU HAD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH EITHER OF. THEM TO SEE WHAT MAY HAPPEN. IN THE NEXT YEAR TO THREE AS RELATES TO HIGHER COSTS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LACK. WE HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THEM ONE ONE. ISSUE THE YOU MAY BE AWARE OF IS THAT THERE. IS A SIGNIFICANT LAG BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN THE THERE'S A CHANGE IN ASSET VALUES IN THE MARKET AND THE WAY IT GETS INCORPORATED INTO THE ACTUARIAL ASSESSMENTS ASSESSMENT SO. THE ASSUMING THAT THE MARKETS DO NOT RECOVER AND THE- ONE IS FOR THE YEAR IS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE ASK THE ACTUAR EARLY ASSUMED RATES OF RETURN FOR THIS YEAR WHICH SEEMS HIGHLY. POSSIBLE AT THIS POINT WE COULD EXPECT HIGHER CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS ARE IN TWO YEARS FROM NOW ESSENTIALLY. THANK YOU MY NEXT QUESTION MY LAST TWO QUESTIONS MATTER JUROR TO WHAT MR OF THIS ONE OF FUND. THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN PUTTING MONEY ASIDE IN THE SCHOOLS RAINY DAY FUND SO I'M CURIOUS HOW. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST THEM ESPECIALLY OF SOME NEVER GOING TO BE DEALING WITH SICK MATT THE FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION. WOULD BE IF YOU CAN. ACT. YES THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LOCK UP A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS ON THE DAY SCHOOL WAS AND THEN I WILL I STARTED OF JANICE OUR CONTENT- YES YOU KNOW CARI WITH REGARDS TO BE Y.

THERE'S ABSOLUTELY AND HOURS IN THERE NOW I THIS CASE ON THE OVERALL COST NINETY EIGHT. WHICH OVER EIGHTY BILLION. IT'S SMALL. BUT NOT BE A- AND WE UNDER THE RULES. IT'S ALSO ME BY. THIS YEAR AND MENTION. FOR BECAUSE LIKELY PROPOSITION NINETY LEVEL WILL LOWER AND NEXT YEAR GIVEN RIGHT USED WE'RE SEEING BACK. TO THAT HUNDRED DOLLAR APPROXIMATELY WILL BE AVAIL. NINE EIGHT SO NOT SHOULD HELP BEAR. IT'S NOT A LARGE NUMBERS I THINK THE SECOND THING I'LL SAY IS THAT. THE I. DEPOSITS MADE ON OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LAST YEAR ARE FOR THEIR TELLS. LOWEST ON. SINCE BURKE'S CLASS FINDLAURIE. THAT WAS TO PRESSURE ON THIS DISTRICTS JUST MY YEAR AND THIS YEAR BY OVER TO BECAUSE THEY WERE TO. FOR IN LONG HAUL. THE SYSTEMS AND IN A LOT FASTER AND ALL NATION IS THAT THE JURORS ACT IN ADDITION TO THE OVERALL ONE HUNDRED SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS IN AID PROPERTY FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ALSO A SEPARATE- BUCKET MONIES. FOR EDUCATION AND I THINK IT WAS IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS STATES AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO. MORE DETAIL ONCE THE SPECIFIC SHARON BACKS FOR CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OF THAT SHOULD HELP IT CERTAINLY. DOESN'T NEGATE.

YOUR TO THE QUESTION HERE STATE AT MATTER MADAM CHAIR YOU I GO ON ALL DAY IS. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND ENSURING THERE CAN BE TO ASK AND QUESTION OF THANK YOU ENERGY ARE I APPRECIATE THAT MUST COME ON A APPRECIATE YOU FOR NOT DOING SO. MOST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SENATOR WHITE. SPEAKER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR USING THE ZOOM- TOOL OF RAISING YOUR HANDS I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'VE SEEN YOU ALL AND WE JUST GIVE YOU THE ORDER SO YOU CAN ANTICIPATE. ARE THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU'LL BE CALLED UPON NEXT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. FOLLOWED BY PAN NIELSEN SKINNER DOLLY AND ROCK. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR WEISS GET WHY CAL SKI- PLEASE LET US KNOW WHO YOU'RE DIRECTING YOUR QUESTIONS TO SIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE TO IT MR POTTS CHECK BASICALLY TRYING TO TRY TO TEACH THE SEVERITY AT THIS SITE THE CULINARY ASSESSMENT ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND THEN I'LL GO TO MISTER DESPITE OSTROM. SWAY LAST SHOT LOW SORRY I AND TO. IN BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT THEY'VE TAKEN I'M LOOKING AT HE IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROJECTIONS IN THE JANUARY BUDGET I SEE THAT WE'RE AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY. THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS- WE'RE SITTING HERE IN APRIL AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN ADELINE SHOWS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS BEING BEING FILED WE'VE GOT ANOTHER MONTH BEFORE WE SEE THE MAY REVISE. AND I ASSUME THAT SOME OF THAT. WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING A GUESS WE GET THE MAY REVISE WHAT ACTUALLY DID REVENUES TO EAT AT THE END OF JUNE AND AGAIN I WAS AROUND. MADAM CHAIR AND- SEN SKINNER IN IT WAS A SLOW RECOVERY BUT THERE WAS SOME WAY TO GAUGE IT I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS SO MY QUESTION IS THAT WHAT TOOLS YOU HAVE. AND THEN IF WE JUST GO TO ONE OF OUR- CONCERNS IS THE PROP TO MONEY. WE MADE AND DESCRIPTIONS OF HOW MUCH RIVER WE'VE WE'RE GONNA HAVE WE PUT MONEY IN IN PROP. IN THE RAINY DAY FUND THAT WAS. WE COULDN'T TOUCH IT. IS MANDATORY IS THAT GOING TO BE REVISED WHEN WE REALIZED OUR REVENUE SPORTS SO WHY WE NEED TO PUT THAT MUCH MONEY IN. AND OUT HOW DOES THAT AFFECT- OUR- ABILITY TO SPEND THAT MONEY. GOING FORWARD. SENATOR MY COUNTY WHO WERE YOU DIRECTING THE QUESTION TO WAS A MISTER PETTIT. MISTER PATRICK OF THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY I THINK AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW IT IS TRUE THAT THE PROPOSITION TO MEASURE HAD SOME TRUE UP IN TRUE DOWN PROVISIONS. THAT AREN'T MY COLLEAGUES FROM PARKER FINANCE MENTIONED. AND IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CAPITAL GAINS RELATED TAX REVENUES ARE LOWER THAN WHAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED AND THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THERE CAN BE A TRUE DOWN. ELEMENT TO IT WHICH WOULD MAKE SOME OF THE- FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR SPENDING. BUT WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT WHAT THAT WILL BE. OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE THE REVENUES IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED RIGHT NOW ALL BECAUSE OF THE- DELAY TAX FILING DATE. AT THE SAME TIME WE ALREADY THINK THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISION THAT IS NECESSARY TO THE REVENUES THAT THAT YOU- REFERENCED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND AS I WAS SAYING IN THE OPENING REMARKS- YOU KNOW IF IT WAS A TYPICAL RECESSION YOU CAN MAYBE THINK ABOUT A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION BUT IN A MORE SEVERE RECESSION. THEY CAN TO THE GREAT RECESSION THEN YOU YOU WOULD INCREASE THAT AMOUNT TO SOMETHING AROUND THIRTY FIVE BILLION. AND SO FAR THE EARLY INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE MIGHT BE HAVING NOW IT COULD BE CLOSER TO THE GREAT RECESSION EXPERIENCE. IN SPEAKER I DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PREPARE FOR FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL DOWNWARD REVISION BUT IT JUST WON'T BE. SOMETHING THAT WE'RE- ABLE TO. PROVIDE A PRECISE ESTIMATE ON PROBABLY UNTIL JULY WHEN WE HAD THE TAX PAYMENT DATE. MEANS SO FAR APRIL IS TYPICALLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MONTHS OF THE YEAR FOR THE STATE'S TAX COLLECTION FOR PERSONAL INCOME TAX. SO FAR IN THE MIND WE'VE HAD MORE TAX REFUNDS PAID OUT THEN WE HAVE COLLECTIONS COMING IN SO IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S A RADICALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF A YEAR. AND SO. YOU KNOW NOT ALL OF THAT IS JUST A FUNCTION OF TIME EITHER AND- THE WITHHOLDING TAX IS UNAFFECTED. WITHHOLDING FROM OUR PAYCHECKS IS UNAFFECTED BY THE DELAY IN THE TAX FILING DATE AND THAT'S ALREADY. SHOWING A 10% REDUCTION. SO I THINK YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE VERY SUBSTANTIAL DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO THE REVENUE ESTIMATES. THE BILL LATER THIS YEAR. THE NUMBERS IN IN MAY IT WILL HAVE PROBABLY THE GREATER- UTILITY TO THEM AND THEN WE WILL REFINE AND THE SUBSEQUENT TWO MONTHS. THANK YOU. FOR FINANCE COULD SET. I'M SURE FINANCE I'M- VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CONSUMER GET YOU KNOW I THINK THAT CONSUMER DEBT IS SKYROCKETING SKYROCKETING I AM CONCERNED ABOUT DEBT COLLECTING AND FILING A BANKRUPTCY. YOU KNOW WE HEAR ABOUT THIS TWELVE HUNDRED BUCKS THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR- COMING FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS FOR. PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE YOU KNOW. SELECT YOUR STATE IN THE MONEY FOR THE- ACTUAL CALIFORNIANS RECEIVED IT. THIS IS A PLAY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS STATE GOVERNMENT ARE THEIR ACTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THERE. ARE GOVERNOR'S FOR ME PROGRAM THIS IS GOING TO YOU KNOW PUT A- YOU KNOW. THE HOLD ON AS YEAH I COLLECTING CONSUMER DEBT FORECLOSURES AND A LIGHT. SO I THINK I COULD SAY I CAN'T SPEAK TOO MUCH TO WHAT MAYBE TIMING HIS THAT'S STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT BUT SENATOR TO YOUR POINT ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE ALREADY SIGNS OF STRESS AND THESE TYPES OF COLLECTION ACTIVITIES- DAY MINISTRATIONS BEEN ACTIVE IN THIS AREA AND FROM SEVEN WORKING WICKS BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO. SOME OF THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE DUE THEY'RE GETTING- THEY'RE GETTING EXTENSIONS TO THOSE PAYMENTS ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE FACING A PRIME COULD MUCH LOWER AND THAT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR MAX. REFUND INTO YOU MENTION. THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE X. ON. IN ADDITION WHILE I DON'T A ALL THE DETAILS OF THE EXCHANGE RIGHT HERE I THE THAT. THE FRENCH TAX. HAS ALSO TAKING ADDITION STAFF. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. OF CRISIS THIS. ARE UNDER A LOT OF STRESS YES OF THOSE EXTRA. WHEN IT COMES THAT BROWN PICTURE AND GOVERNOR'S BY SHAKES. DOES THAT STATE FINANCIAL. LOS ANY UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OVERSIGHT WE ARE LOOKING YOU KNOW AT THIS PROPOSAL ON EVERY NEW PROPOSAL THAT WAS CREATED IN JANUARY AS PART OF THAT WORK ON BUDGET REDEFINITION WE WERE DISCUSSING- BUT CERTAINLY THIS REMAINS AN AREA. PRIORITY WITH THE GOVERNOR AND IS YOUR TEAMS THEY WERE THE ONES REACHED OUT AND HELPED NEGOTIATE AN AGREEMENT I'M THESE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. THANK YOU. FINALLY FOR I NOTED THAT THE US WERE SERVICES A PRESCRIBED BURNS SOMEHOW TO PROTECT FIRE PERSONNEL WE'VE GOT NUMBERS ARE COMING IN ARE YOU KNOW ONE THING ABOUT THE IN ACTIVITY ECONOMICALLY SPEAKING IS OUR AIR QUALITY IN LOS ANGELES AROUND THE STATE IS FANTASTIC THIS CAL FIRE HAVE PLANS TO SUSPEND PRESCRIBED BURNS AT THAT THIS IS THE TIME WE WILL BE DOING WE'RE RAMPING UP THE- HOLES. SO I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS THAT I HAVE BOTH TO RESET COUNTER AND STEVEN BANKS AND- ON THE LINE WHO MAY KNOW MORE SALT FOR IT OVER TO THEM BANKS THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THEY ALSO MAY HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU BUT AS- RECENT WORK STEPHEN YOU WANT. IN. YEAH THAT'S- SOMETHING WE'LL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON SENATOR WE DON'T HAVE THAT. AND MARK THAT AS A FOLLOW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MANAGER.

ESSENTIAL TO US ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN LISTS ARE- ARE STAY AT HOME ORDERS AND SO FORTH THAT THE GOVERNOR OUTLINED AND SO FOR EXAMPLE I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE BOTTLENECKS AND TESTING RIGHT. AND MEDIA ARE BETTER. ARE THERE'S EVEN A- BOTTLENECKS MEDICATIONS NOW FOR WE'D HAVE THIS LOOK LIKE WE HAVE THE FASTER OTHERS DO BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF WE DID NEED TO ACTIVATE SOME WRITERS AND WHAT SHORTAGES OF SEDATION MEDICATIONS AND OTHER TYPES OF MEDICATIONS NECESSARY FOR PEOPLES ARE.

FROM AN OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE CAN WE ALSO. PUBLISH WHERE THAT WHAT DECISIONS THEY MADE. WELL I WILL ADDRESS THAT BY SAYING THAT JUST LIKE IN OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS THAT IS A PROCESS WHERE WE'RE IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTIES AND- JUDY KIDDING HOUSING SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE SCARCE.

HELP WITH THOSE THE CONCERN WOULD PROVIDE. ALL OF THAT INFORMATION- PUBLICLY IS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF EAT VERY VERY HIGH VALUE- HIGHLY DESIRED AND- IT COULD POTENTIALLY OPEN UP THAT YOU DON'T. ISSUES WITH QUESTIONING DECISIONS OR- YOU'RE FREE PROCESS IT'S OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE HAVE UNDERSTANDS- SO YEAH WE WANT TO BE DELIVER AND WE WANT TO BE WORKING FOR THIS IS. THAT WE HAVE. CLOSELY WITH. YEAH YEAH SOMEHOW HE THAT HAS NOT BEEN COMMUNITY TO US AND WE THAT. ASIAN AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THEY YOU HAVE YOU NEED TO TEACH YOU WITH CERTAIN BROKER PLEASE PLEASE WORK WITH THAT BUT IN TERMS OF JUST BROADLY PUTTING OUT YOU KNOW IN THIS WOULD FOR ANY YOU KNOW FIGHT.

THE FIRST ONE BEING SWAPPED OUT WE ARE WORKING WITH VARIOUS ENTITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LOOK AT OTHERS WHILE OPTIONS THAT ARE FDA APPROVED WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH ACADEMIC IT FUSION. THAT EITHER. OR YOU. OPTIONAL REPRINTING SLOBS IN ORDER PRICE TO BE TO MAKE THIS CHAIN ISSUE I'M BYRON YEAH IT DOESN'T YOU WHERE I'M WITH ARMY IS IT'S THE IN THE TO ONE YOU TAKE THE. AND IF YOUR COMPANIES ACTUALLY IN CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE OUR OWN MYRON MEDIA AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW WE'RE- IF YOU COMPANIES TO LOOK AT THAT IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE. OKAY THANK YOU- SO MY NEXT QUESTION CAN GET IN BAXTER TO FINANCE IN MINISTRATION- SO NOW THE GOVERNOR LAID OUT CERTAIN SIX ITEMS NECESSARY FOR US TO FINALLY RESTORE YOUNG MOVE FORWARD- YEAH RECOGNIZING THAT ARE BUDGETARY PROBLEMS ARE STEMMING FROM THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT WE- THAT. WE NEED TO MOVE BACK TOWARD- NOTE RECOGNIZING THAT'S GONNA TAKE TIME- SO THE FIRST. ITEM THAT THE GOVERNOR POINTED OUT WHAT IS THE ABILITY TO MONITOR PROTECTOR COMMITTEES TO TESTING CONTACT MISSING ICE BLADING SUPPORTING THOSE ARE POSITIVE ARTS LETTERS. SO IN ORDER TO GET THEIR- WE'RE GONNA BE TOO GREAT STAND ARE TESTING WERE CONTACT TRACING WELL WE MAY BE ABLE. YOU TECHNOLOGY WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT MORE. WORKING FOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE TESTING CAPACITY WE'RE GONNA NEED PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO QUARANTINE. WE NEED TO THANK YOUNG. ONCE YOU KNOW HOW SO HOW WHEN WILL YOU STACK TO SEE PROPOSALS FROM THE- FROM FINANCE I MEAN THESE THINGS WILL COST MONEY TO SO WHEN. WHICH WILL EXPECT TO SEE PROPOSALS FROM ADDED MINISTRATION REGARDS TO ACHIEVING THOSE PARTICULAR ENDS I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A TASK FORCE AND SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MAY STILL BE WORKED ON BUT FOR EXAMPLE. WE NEED TO START DISSIPATING HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU TO HIRE FOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS EVERY MORE MY- HIGHER PEOPLE. GOING TO HAPPEN RIGHT HOW WE CONTACT DO WE NEED. WHAT KIND OF óRDENES SO WE NEEDS I KNOW WORK OUR TO GET PLACES FOR. A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO STAY. WORKER AND PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS AND SO FORTH BUT THAT. WHAT REALLY CAN'T QUARANTINE SO WHERE WE WOULD THAT AND WHAT AND WHEN DO WE EXPECT TO SEE PROPOSALS AND ALSO. BUDGET RELATED TO THIS I'D SO WE CAN ACTUALLY A KIND MAYBE. MOVING SO A LITTLE MORE THAN IT'S MOVING NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUNDING OF THESE PROPOSALS WE ARE DEFINITELY WORKING ON THAT INCLUDING IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS LEADING UP TO. NAY REVISION AND AS YOU NOTED THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED THIS AS A TOP PRIORITY AND KEY. TO ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS SINCE ALL WITH THE SIX PROCESS THINKING ABOUT WHEN AND HOW WE CAN REOPEN THE ECONOMY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE GOVERNOR ISSUES THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER- BE ABLE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. DRAW ON ANY LEGALLY AVAILABLE SIGNS UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACCESS IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE THAT WE CAN WRAP THIS THING UP AND WE KNOW IT'S AN AREA WHERE THE UNREST AND- HE'S- IF YOU DO THAT AS SOON AS- BUT WE ALSO THAT. CONTINUING TO THE YEAR SO THAT'S OF MIND FOR US DON'T HAVE FUNDING RIGHT NOW BUT I SEE THAT NOT BECAUSE WERE NOT WORKING ON IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS GOING DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR CLOTHING NINETEEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR DIFFERENT BUCKETS SACKS MY WE WERE DISCUSSING BEFORE AND I SHOULD ACTUALLY TURNED OVER TO MARKON THE CASE PLAY ON THE LINE WORKING WITH SECRETARY MY ONLY. JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE RARE ARTS THESE ALTERNATE OVER TO MARK UP. THANK YOU HAVE RAISED A NUMBER A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THE FRAMEWORK AT THE GOVERNOR LATE HOURS EARLIER THIS WEEK- IS INTENDED TO BE A FRAMEWORK TO HELP US. I'LL LOOK AT HOW WE MODIFY AND OVER THERE YEAH YOU GUYS ARE THE NON PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. I IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE NOW ACTIVELY WORKING IN CREATING QUIRK. FOR EACH ONE OF THESE INDICATORS ON THE GOVERNOR AND- THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA AND YOU AND- FRENCH RECOVER. TO PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES ON OUR PROGRESS WITH REGARDS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SIX. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH YOU THE REST OF THE PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY OUR PARTNERS. COUNTY LEVEL AS WELL AS OUR HEALTH SYSTEM PARTNERS AROUND EACH ONE OF THESE. WITH REGARDS TO CASTING WE WILL BACKGROUND APPROACH OUR TEST WE'VE BEEN- AS THE GOVERNOR HAS ALLUDED IN. PRIOR STATEMENTS OUT WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO TRY TO. INCREASE OUR TESTING CAPACITY ACROSS STATE AND- AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG ONE IS NOT YES YEAH. BUT ALL OF OUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET IN TERMS OF IT PASSED BUT LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE- TESTING. AND SO. WE ARE. WITH OUR AFTER INSTITUTIONS I IN ORDER TO BUILD A- GROUP. NG SO THAT IS ONE AREA IN WHICH WE CAN ACCU DIGITAL ASK. WE ARE WORKING WHERE I'M SECTOR COMPANIES YEAH WEBER THREE. WHEN ASKED SO WE READ AS YOUR OF MACHINES WHERE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASK ADAM PROGRAMS IT'S NOT I GREW BUT INDIVIDUALS OUT SO WHEN HE I ORDER TO A RAP RESPONSE WITH REGARDS TO CAST I AND THEN I THINK FINALLY WE'RE REAL LOOKING COMMUNITY CASTING SERVING. ASKING TOGETHER SENSE OF WHY EYED AS AND UNITY WITH THE COMMUNITY LIKE A HOW SPREAD OF THE VIRUS I CAN SO WE SOME YOU KNOW PARTNERSHIPS WITH EASE THE CRIME STATE REALLY YOU SOME OF THE- MICHAEL I OR RIGHT TESTING AFTER A LACK OF A BETTER. IN ORDER US TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR ASKING YOUR ASKING WE VIRTUALLY. ENSURE THAT WE- THE ART OF SELLING A SUPPLY WE HERE AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS WHICH WE CAN MAKE IT I SSUE I JOIN THINGS LIKE READING RENDON'S BOB BY MAKING OUR OWN VIRAL. I'M ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE HALF SIMULTANEOUS HERE WITH OUR EFFORTS. ASK DO YOU SPEAK TO. APPRECIATE THE WAY ON TEST USED TO. THE CAR TRACING OF IT BECAUSE WE NEED TO THESE THINGS PARALLEL RIGHT WE DO AND- TAKE AS LONG TO GET THERE. YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT AND FOR MANY OUR COLLEAGUE WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE CONTACT. IS IT'S AN EPIDEMIOLOGY I TERM IS YOU. IN THINGS LIKE WORK IN MOST. CAN BE USED IN THE- AS WELL AND MANY ARE MANY INTERNET. ACADEMIC AND HERE IS WHO ARE THERE FROM. YEAH I KNOW JUST ARE. OUT HOW YOU SOME THOSE AND THAT WILL TO THE NOTION OF. I'M NOT TRYING TO TRAYS AND YET YOU'RE REAL IS LOOK AT HIM AND- WHO MIGHT BE CORRECT POSITIVE AND THAT YOU THAT CONTACT YOUR SHE MIGHT HAVE. AND THEN LOOKING AT WAYS WHICH YOU. THOSE AND- TO MITIGATE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IT REALLY IS THE TRIGGER. STRATEGY WE- EARLY ON IN THIS. AND IN ORDER US TO LET THOSE AND. YEAH I ARE MODIFYING THOSE GUYS THE GOVERNOR LIVED IN WE REALLY HAVE TO CREATE A WE- AT WE ARE PRACTICALLY LOOKING. FOR PIECE IT GOING TO REQUIRE WORK WORDS ALSO. IRIS TO BE CREATIVE AND OF HOW LEFT TECHNOLOGY USED OF THOSE PIECES AND SO THAT WAS WORK THAT WE PEOPLE US AND THAT'S THE THAT THE GUY. HAS CHARGES WE LOOK FORWARD TO BRINGING SO MANY TO OLD AND A GEN PUBLIC IN THE COMING DAYS WEEKS AROUND AFTER. I HAD READ SHEET THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE- THIS MAY TAKE LONG THAN YOU THINK THEIR STAFFING ISSUES BUT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY JUST TRYING TO BE SOME. ISSUES ABOUT PRIVACY AND CIVIL RIGHTS PEOPLE MAY BRING OUT DEPENDING ON WHAT HOW DO WE PLAN TO USE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO WORK OUT TOO SO. I HOPE WE YEAH GET AHEAD OF THAT AND- NOT WAIT TOO LONG TO START ENGAGING IN DISCUSSIONS. THE OTHER THING I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH ON A YEAH AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET BACK TO. THE LISTING SOME OF THE ISSUES AND I WANT TO BUILD ON WHAT. US CAMBIADO BROUGHT OUT. IS THAT WHAT YOU. RIGHT NOW- IS AN APPRECIATE YOUR PRAISE FOR THE HOSPITALS AND THE DOCTORS IN THE FRONT LINE AND THEY'LL SAY THANK YOU FOR THE PRAISE BUT WE COULD USE MORE HELP- SO GRACE IS GREAT BUT HELP IS BETTER- AND SO THE CHALLENGE IS JUST THAT YOU'LL DAIS. BUT YOUNGER LOSING MONEY RIGHT- WE HAVE A CLINIC DOWN SANTA BARBARA THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MAIN PROVIDER THAT. STANDS IN CLINIC THAT MAY BE GOING BELLY UP OR AT LEAST- THEY'RE LAYING OFF A LOT OF STAFF. RIGHT ARE YOUR- DOCTORS PRACTICE OF THE PRACTICE ITSELF DOESN'T CLOSE THE NAY LAY OFF THEIR STAFF. RIGHT AND- WE ARE HERE FROM PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS AND DATE BASICALLY- YOU KNOW THEY'RE DROPPING THEIR VISITS YOU'RE TRYING TO. TELL US ALL SAFETY SHE USED TO WORK YEAH GET PEOPLE REVERSE. ALL BUT- BASICALLY IF THEY'RE NOT AROUND- IT BECAUSE THE LAID OFF THEIR NURSING STAFF THEY CLOSED UP. BUT. AT WORK. WHAT PLAN BILL ACTUALLY TAKE CARE. THE ISSUES THAT GOT CUT OFF THESE. ALWAYS TALK ABOUT LIKE DID PROCEDURE. THOSE ARE NOT OP ALL THE HAPPEN TO BE THING THAT NOT NECESSARILY SPURGEON SO CALLED IT BUT WE HAVE KOBE AND THESE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. AND SO- WHAT ARE. AND YOU KNOW I'LL FRANKLY JUST PUT IT OUT THERE- BECAUSE I AM A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES I'M STILL WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO TELL ME THAT SHE GOT A SINGLE CENT FROM THE DISASTER. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE TO MY DISTRICT MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME YET BUT EVERYONE I'VE ASKED KNOWN SENIOR CENTER- SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WORLD RIGHT NOW. AND CAPACITY. IF WE- FIND A WAY. TO FIGURE HOW TO USE THAT SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO BE SURE WE MADE THAT CAPACITY OUR MEDIC ROLAND I'M WE'LL GO UP WITH THAT PEOPLE BEING OFF ON AND SO FORTH AND ANY IN. SO WHERE WE GOING TO BE SURE THIS NEXT IS THERE TO CARE. THANK YOU CENTER. THANK AYE YOU. NO I AM SAYING YOU BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A LOT OF THE POINT YOU KNOW THAT ON TOP OF MY FOR THE GOVERNOR FIRST OF ALL I KNOW A SMALLER POINT THAT YOU MADE BY EX ON THE STAGE. ACTION ACT THE MINISTRY THE HONORS BEEN VERY CLEAR YOU TO BE SEX AND NOT ONLY NEEDS MORE MONEY BUT THE HELP IS NOT REALLY GETTING TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT WE'RE WORRIED I NAY FRIENDS ON THE WEST COAST YOU KNOW WHY MONEY RUNS OUT OR THEY REALLY HAD TIME TO GET THROUGH SOMEBODY'S NETWORKS. ON THE LANDING BOB COSTAS LENDERS CRUZ YEAH AND RELATIVELY SLOW DOWN WICKS. SO THE GOVERNOR'S MAKE. EXCELLENT JUST SMALLER. ANY ON THE BROADER. AS KNOW THE LATE. PRIOR TO THE MOSTLY. YEARS I. THAT CALM APPROVED A SIX POINT TWO PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT FEDERAL MEDICAID. THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE AND WHILE THAT'S GOOD AND THAT WILL PROVIDING THE BILLINGS DOLLARS. AGE FOR THE STAGE IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH AND YOU ARE RIGHT. POINTING OUT THE IRONY THAT. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY GRAY DAVIS HEALTH CRISIS THAT THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN IN RECENT MEMORY. OUR HEALTH INSTITUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE SO THE GOVERNOR HAS ALSO CALLED FOR. DOUBLING THAT SIX POINT TWO PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE MAKING AT LEAST 12% IF NOT MORE. AND MORE THAN THAT WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT'S NOT INCREASED IS ONLY FOR THE DURATION. OF THE- NC ASK FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINDS IT SO. YOU KNOW THIS EMERGENCY COULD LAST FOR A COUPLE MORE MINDS BUT THE ASSOCIATED IMPACTS. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND I LOOKING ACCESS IS SO SEATED HEALTH AND- IN TERMS OF POPULATION HEALTH BUT ALSO HEALTH AND FINANCIAL. YOU SHOULD CAN ON FOR SOME YEARS SO THAT. USE ONE TOLL WITHIN A COUPLE MIND STANDING LOSING THAT REIMBURSEMENT ADJUSTMENT. THAT WE NEEDED MOST SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO QUESTION VERY STRONG ON THAT NOT ONLY SUMS LEVEL EXTENDING THE DURATION AND THEN THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IN THEIR CAREER ON. HELLO THERE'S ALSO. IN THE LAST YEAR'S ACTOR WAS A PUSH FOR ADDITIONAL. BENEFITS SOMETHING UP B. R. LEVEL BY SIXTEEN PERCENT. AND IT DIDN'T MAKE IT BRUCE SO WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD WITH OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE NEXT BUILDING CASE AT A TIME WHEN MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING ON CAL WORKS. I'M SORRY JOHN FRESH IN ADDITION TAX MEDI CAL AND CAL WORKS YOU AND IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE RESOURCES THEY NEED- AND- HEALTHY NUTRITIOUS FOODS THAT'S GOING TO PUT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND SOCIAL SAFETY NET AS- WELL SO. THIS IS ALL TOP OF MIND FOR US AND WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT MORE WE- OKAY. AND JUST ONE MORE QUESTION. TOLD OF THE CHECK BUT SINCE. HEALTH AND HUMAN. ON HUMAN SIR. SITES YOU KNOW THE EXTENSION OF THE HOLD HARMLESS PROGRAM WAIVERS SO WHERE PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO RENEW THEIR- SERVICES THAT ARE STAYING AT HOME WHERE. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE TELLING WORKERS TO TRY TO STAY AT HOME IT CETERA- WE'D BE SURE THAT. PEOPLE DON'T FALL OFF BENEFITS THE DAIRY HAVE. WELL WE'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS. YES ON THIS QUESTION I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO ADAM DORSEY ATHLETES ARE HHS UNIT HERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NEITHER HAMMER WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER PEOPLE ON THE LINE WHO ARE AT FOCUSED ON THE SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY I'M SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. AND I'M REALLY SORRY THAT THEY THEY SPECIFIC QUESTION WAS ON THE WHICH PIECE OF THE ELIGIBILITY. WELL BASICALLY THE EXTENSION OF HOME HARM LISTS THAT PROGRAM WAIVERS AND BEING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING THE SERVICES NOW THAT HANDLES THOSE TO BE STAYING AT HOME RIGHT. FAMILIES WHAT ABOUT THE WORK THE- THE WORKERS AT THE COUNTY AND SO FORTH- SO HOW WE BE SURE PEOPLE DON'T FALL OFF THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO CHECK IN- TO THIS IN ADDITION THE FACT THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE ROLLING. OUT LEVEL THE PEOPLE CURRENTLY ON THE SCHOOLS PEOPLE ENROLLING BE SURE THEY DON'T FALL OFF- DURING THAT WHILE WE'RE ALL HOLDING UP AT ALL. YEAH SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND START AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING. THAT MARCO FROM HHS AGENCY MUST ADD PLEASE FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN. BUT THAT WAS REALLY THE IDEA BEHIND THE AUGMENTATION PARTICULARLY AROUND THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING- IS THAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN WHEN SOME COUNTY OFFICES WERE BEING SHUT DOWN THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO CONTINUE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS AND GET PEOPLE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM AND A LOT OF THE FLEXIBILITY STAND THAT WE SOUGHT. I'M WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACROSS A NUMBER OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED GETTING PEOPLE TO ACCESS TELEPHONIC SERVICES- AND SO WE REALLY DONE. YOU KNOW IT A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW CROSS SOMEBODY'S AUGMENTATIONS IN ACROSS SOME OF THE FEDERAL WAIVERS THAT WERE SEEKING CURRENTLY- TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET ENROLLED STATE ROLE NOT PROGRAMS. ARE PARTICULARLY OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS AS WE CONTINUE TO KIND OF ASSESS THE SITUATION BUT- I DON'T KNOW MARK UP THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. I I'LL GIVE. YOU YOU SPECIFIC EXAMPLE ON THE CAL WORKS NEAR WHERE. VERY CLOSELY REFERENCE. OUR TO GIVE THEM A MUCH LESS. AS POSSIBLE SO. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES YOU WHY IS WE HAVE THE TO FACE REQUIRE. AND WE'VE ALSO THE WAY SIGNATURE REQUIRED AND SO THE IDEA HERE IS REALLY SURE THAT WE ARE I HAVE YEAH. BALLPARK ARE. STRANGE PROGRAM ARE BEHALF BUT ALSO I AM SORT. WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THE ABILITY TO REALLY NAVIGATE THAT ACCENTUATION WE ARE ALSO HAVING TO BE MINE ALTHOUGH HOW WE ENGAGE OR EVEN ON THE JOB. SITE WHILE MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING THE SOCIAL BURKE WORKERS MIGHT. BE ENGAGING WITH. BUT THERE WERE ALSO PROTECT BECAME AND ARE IN THE WELL SYSTEMS WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT THOSE TWO THINGS. YEAH IN TERMS OF GETTING. ON HOW WE THE WE CONTINUE TO WORK OUR COUNTY PARTNERS EIGHT. AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. THE BULLET WE MIGHT. RIGHT WELL YOU SIR I MUCH MANAGER APPRECIATE THE AND- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PAN WITHIN TO MOVE ON TO SENATOR NAILS ALL. LIKE THIS ONE TO A NON THE FACT WE'VE HIS OUR MAR WE'VE GOT CURRENTLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ON QUEUE FOR THE CALLS. AND I JUST ASK THAT YOU BE MINDFUL IF YOU COULD LIMIT YOUR QUESTIONS THIS IS YOUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO POSE QUESTIONS TO THE LTO OR FINANCE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE HEARING ROOM. HERE AND PUBLICLY EXPOSE WITH THAT SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU CHAIR FOR MISTER VISION NOT THAN. SENATE MORE LIKE BEGAN THIS WITH. IN QUERY AND OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE MASK CONTRACT. I MUST EMPHASIZE THAT'S A BIG DEAL. AND MANY OF US VERY VERY INSISTENT AT SEEING THE TERMS OF THAT CONTRACT. I MUST CONFESS I AM NOT MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE BEING DELIVERED. DASH SUGGEST FOR A WHOLE LOT OF REASONS. AND WHAT IS IN THE CONTRACT THE INSURERS DELIVERABILITY TIMELY. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AT THE LEAST WE CANNOT BE JUST THROWING OUT A FALSE HOPE TO PEOPLE. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY INVOLVED IN THIS TO. SO PLEASE DO UNDERSTAND THERE THERE IS NOT AN EXPECTATION BUT A DEMAND. THE THAT THAT CONTRACT BECOME AVAILABLE. OF MISTER BUSH NOTHING THE ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S. THE NOW SINCE IN DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS THAT WAS ATTRACTIVE TO ME WAS THE DESIRE. AN INTEREST IN TRACKING THE PROGRAMS THAT FOR THE HOMELESS AND THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. BUT THERE'S NOT BEEN MUCH SPECIFICITY OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE DID SOME DISCUSSION HERE JUST A BIT AGO ABOUT TO PUTTING THEM INTO THE FACILITIES OF OUR FAIRS THAT I HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT QUITE AS EASY AS SOME WOULD THINK JUST FILL UP THOSE. PURPOSES PLEASE BUT HOW DO WE DIDN'T TUITION FROM THE HOTELS AND MOTELS THE FAIRS THESE VARIOUS FACILITIES. TO THE NEXT LEVEL. AS WE PROCEED I THINK THAT'S MORE JUST AN OBSERVATION. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC MAYBE YOU CAN'T THE GOVERNOR THE OTHER DAY DID TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE COLLUDED ABOUT THE COST THE CRITERIA. OF FOR WHAT'S BEEN CALLED OPENING UP IN OTHER WORDS DOING WHAT CAN BE REQUIRED. TO HELP THE ECONOMY. PROTECTING OUR SMALL COMMUNITIES OR ARE STRICTLY OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. HE HAD OUTLINED CERTAIN PARAMETERS OR BENCHMARK THINGS IS WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO DIRECT IN STAGE OR PHASE THESE OPENING UP ATTEMPTS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT HAVE YOU HAD MUCH DISCUSSION IN THOSE HIGHER COUNCILS ABOUT THIS OPENING UP CONCEPT. YES YES SENATOR AND IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WILL BE BASED ON OF ALL THINGS CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND BUT ALTERNATE OVER TO MARK ON MAGIC SHE WAS BEEN INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS IS TAX. NIELSEN THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THEN I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AS THE GOVERNOR ALLUDED TO. EARLIER THIS WEEK WHEN YOU ROLLED OUT THAT THE STATE'S INDICATORS FOR HOW WE MODIFYING. THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT YOU WANTED TO. CONGRESS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AROUND HOW WE GET TO THAT POINT ABOUT JUST. AND PROPPING SOMETHING THAT WAS SO BEING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS- IS AND WEEKS AS PRICE TO REALLY BE. ALL ABOUT HOW WE ENGAGE THE PUBLIC THAT ARE I AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AROUND EACH ONE OF THESE INDICATORS AND GOVERNOR WHILE YOU'RE TRYING. WE ON THE STANDING. ARE PROVIDE THE GENERAL PUBLIC BUT WE ALSO DO YOU. OUT WITH THE LEAD YOU. OR HOW WE'RE MAKING A SEPARATE INDICATE. LOOK QUITE QUESTIONS WE TO ANSWER. IN THE- AND WHAT THEY WILL. OUR DECISION MAY. REALLY TERM WHETHER OR NOT THE GOVERNOR LISTS THOSE. INTERVENTION OR MODIFY SAYS INTERVENTIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE WORK I MEAN. IN THE- COMING DAYS AND WEEKS WITH REGARDS TO THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE ARE NOT EARLIER THIS. YEAR THANK YOU THAT THE LASTLY. FOR MISTER MISSION NOT. I THE BY PROCESS. NO THE LEGISLATIVE AND BUDGET PROCESSOR GREATLY COMPACTED THIS YEAR. MORE SO THAN IN MY EXPERIENCE. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS EVOLVING AND DEVELOPING NOW AS WE PROCEED WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE TIMES THAT WE'VE ENJOYED IN THE PAST FOR IN DEPTH THAT SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS. HOW WILL THIS BUDGET PROCESS NOW COME TOGETHER AS YOU'RE ENVISIONING IT. TO CALL REACH CLOSURE ON OUR BUDGET. TWO AS LA- MENTIONED SO MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING- INCLUDING THE FIRST YEAR IN ECONOMIC DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE WILL BE BASED ON THE COURSE OF THE VIRUS ITSELF WHICH WE CAN ONLY CRITICS BUT WE CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS TO STAY WITHTHE MAY FOURTEENTH. CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE FOR THE NAY REVISIONS AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH MAY AND JUNE AND CERTAINLY WHILE THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE DON'T KNOW OUR INTERNAL REVENUE AND FORECASTING TEAM IT'S GOING TO DO THE VERY BEST AND TO CREATE JACKS THE TYPES OF THE REVENUES IN THE TYPES OF ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE UPCOMING. YOU ARE BASS. PRESENTED AND THE LATEST IS ON PASS ACT OF BALANCE I MY KIDS SO WE'RE GONNA WITH PROCESS THAT BEING SAID IT IS AS IF AS IT TURNS OUT THE VIRUS INVOLVES MOTHER IN A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WAY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE WAY WE EXPECT IN MAY AND IN JUNE THEN WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND I SPEND A PRACTICE AND- YEARS WHERE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. OR ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT WE MIGHT. THE BUDGET SUBSEQUENT ACTION IN THE MIDDLE OF NEXT FISCAL YEAR RIGHT NOW WE'RE PLANNING TO COME TO YOU THE LAST. INSTEAD NAY A REVISED BUDGET BY MADE FOURTEEN. AND HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU TO THE PROCESS TO MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL THAT. THANK YOU AND LASTLY FOR A- LEAD JANICE PANIC. THE THIS ONE OF OUR- AREAS OF OUR BUDGET EXPENDITURES IT. IT'S BEEN USUALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR DECADES LETTER. ARE THE APPLICATION. OF TECHNOLOGY THE EXPANSION TECHNOLOGY THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE SPENT ON PROJECTS THAT DID NOT WORK CRASHED AND BURNED WERE LONG OVERDUE. DO YOU SEE ANY ROOM HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR TIME WHERE WE CAN FOCUS ON GETTING SOME OF THOSE THINGS UNDER CONTROL. BEYOND JUST RE NAMING A NEW AGENCIES. AS WE HAVE DONE WITH DO IT DON'T DON'T AT ME HITS IS NOTHING BUT CHANGES NAMES- BUT THEN I SEE THIS IS A IS AN OUT OF CONTROL AREA DO YOU SEE THAT AS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD. DEVOTE SOME ATTENTION TO. YES SENATOR NIELSEN THANK YOU- YES OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN DOING SOME ANALYSIS. OF THESE PROJECTS WITHIN THE- THROUGHOUT THE STATE GOVERNMENT. INK MIKE FOLEY CAROLYN CHIU MIGHT BE IN A GOOD POSITION TO OFFER SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS WORK FOR YOU ON THAT. THANK YOU. TURNER NIELSEN THIS IS CAROLINE SURE CAN YOU HEAR ME I CAN'T THANK YOU. OKAY SO AS I A- MISTER PECK MENTIONED AS A COMPONENT OF OUR LOW BASELINE SCENARIO ONE OF THE AVENUES THAT WE ARE EXAMINING OUR- THE I. T. PROJECTS FOR WHICH THE STATE COULD POTENTIALLY EITHER PUT ON PAUSE FOR. BACK SOME OF THE FUNDING WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THOSE ACTIONS AND THE CHOICES THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED. IN THAT THAT'S A VERY NEAR TERM ISSUE OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO TRYING TO IDENTIFIED YEAH ECCENTRIC JUST IT COULD REDUCE COSTS IN THOSE AREAS AS WEAKNESS BUT BUDGET PROBLEM AND IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. THE DOOR UP AND MAKE A THOUGH I THINK IS A LONGER TERM ONE IN TERMS OF HOW THE SPEAKER ARE AFFECTED WE DEPLOY ITS RESOURCES FOR IT SOLUTIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING. AS YOU KNOW WE ARE WE HAVE WORKED ON AND OFF ON. ISN'T SOME CHANGES PROCESS THE STATE UNDER YOUR TO ENSURE THAT RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OUR ANALYSIS OF HOW WELL THAT NEW SYSTEM- IT'S GOING AS NEW PROJECTS ARE CONTINUE FORWARD IN YEARS TO COME BACK IN THE PAST OBSERVATION IF I MADE THE MISTAKE AND AGAIN IN YOUR TEAM. FINANCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS VERY PROBLEMATIC SITUATION RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN REVENUE ISSUES HUGE BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY AND OTHER OTHER MATTERS. AS WELL. AT THE END UNDERSTANDING THAT. COULD WE EXAMINE MANDATE RELIEF THE OUT THAT USED TO BE A REAL BIG ISSUE. NOT MUCH CHANGED OTHER THAN ADDING MORE MANDATES. BUT I DO BELIEVE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE TRULY HELPFUL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPOWERING LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE SHOULD EXAMINE SOME OF THE STATE IMPOSED MANDATES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CAN I TAKE A LOOK AT THAT DO YOU SEE HIM MERIT THE UC OF A VENUE IN THIS BUDGET WHERE WE COULD. GIPSON MANDATE RELIEF TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. PUBLIC POLICIES SENATOR NIELSEN. YES I MEAN THIS IS AN AREA WHERE OUR OFFICE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL. RESEARCH ON YOUR BEHALF- BUT I THINK CAROLINE CHIU AGAIN MY COLLEAGUES POTENTIALLY OFFERS DIGITAL STARTS HERE. CENTER NIELSEN SO I AS YOU KNOW UNDER- PROPOSITION ONE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- DO NOT HAVE TO PERFORM MANDATES THAT THE STATE ARE JUST NOT FUN THERE ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS TO THOSE- BUT OTHERWISE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ONLY NEED TO BE- PERFORMING. BEING MANDATES FOR WHICH THE STATE HAS PROVIDED FUNDING THAT SAID I DO KNOW A NUMBER OF MANDATES- REMAIN ON THE BOOKS- THAT- I THINK MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMPLY WITH I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT OUR OFFICES RIGHT NOW. ABOUT ELECTION NEEDS ON AND SO CERTAINLY THERE'S THERE IS THE QUESTION BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE ARE THERE PARTICULAR MANDATES THAT REMAIN ON THE BOOKS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD ONCE YOU FIND. ONE IN THE IN THE CURRENT- IN THE BUDGET YEAR I'M KIND OF DEPENDING ON WHAT THOSE ARE- BUT ARE THERE OTHER SAY THAT COULD BE THAT COULD BE- ELIMINATED EVERY CERTAINLY CORD. A LOOK AT ANY ONES THAT YOU THERE ARE PARTICULAR INTEREST YEAR OR MORE BROADLY. AND THAT ARE SUSPENDED- AND WE CAN OPERATE YEAR THAT LIST AS WELL THAT'S HELPFUL. I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE HERE ON THE MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HOW THIS IS INVOLVED THAN THE THAN I AM. THE YOU KNOW IT. NOTWITHSTANDING PROP ONE AND IF. THEY DON'T HAVE TO IF THEY GET FUNDED- WE HAVE ANOTHER ROUND IT'S CONSTRAINED A LOT OF THAT OPTION OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CALL LITIGATION. AND CASE LAW HIS STOCK. THE A LOT A LOT OF WHAT WE COULD DO TO HELP AND GIVE THEM MANDATE RELIEF SO I JUST SUGGEST WE KEEP AN EYE ON THAT IS IT IS STILL THE ISSUE THAT THE DEVILS. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. THREE TO NIELSEN THANK YOU MOVING ON TO SENATOR SKINNER US SENATOR SKINNER BE SURE TO IDENTIFY WHO YOU'RE ADDRESSING YOUR QUESTION TO PLEASE THANK YOU. ALL THE STAFF BUT THIS YEAR IN TOGETHER- THIS QUESTION IS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I NOTICED THAT IN- NONE OF THE SECTION EIGHT SECTION THIRTY SIX ACTIONS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED SO FAR- THERE IS NOT AND BINDING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO MENTAL SERVICES. I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT IS THEIR CHILDREN PLACE ORDER CONTINUES AND- PEOPLE ARE ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT ENABLE TO. SAYS NORMAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND THE ECONOMIC PRESSURES THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF. INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH STRESSES AND THAT WOULD REDUCE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD COME IN ON THAT. PLANTS THANK YOU I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE RIGHT NOW OR IN OUR HHS UNIT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR CAN YOU HEAR ME. ALL YES THANK YOU I RYAN MILLER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'VE BEEN- AS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE HEARING WE'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH- YOU KNOW HOSPITAL PARTNERS- YOU KNOW DOCTORS AND ALSO ON OUR PARTNERS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH WORLD TO YOU KNOW BE IN CONSTANT CONTACT TO LEARN ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING WE'RE ALSO WORKING YES. OUR MEN'S HEALTH CARE SERVICES NOTABLY IN THIS CASE. SHOULD BE TRACKING THOSE SITUATIONS AND WE ARE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHEN WE- IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL DETAILS SOON ABOUT. POTENTIAL SECTION THIRTY SIX WINNING WILL BE SUBMITTING A REQUEST. THANK YOU AND I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT. THE STATE PROVIDE RIGHT INCREASED. HI MY NEXT QUESTION IS LSO. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I NOTED THE DIFFERENT- SECTION THIRTY SIX LETTERS AND ACTIONS REGARDING- INCREASED ACCESS FOR GETTING HOMELESS FOLKS OUT OFF THE STREET AND INTO SOME KIND OF AN INTEL TOLERANCE OR OTHER THINGS. AND WHAT COMMENT I HAVE IS THAT WE ARE USING THE SAME- SYSTEM THAT WE DID THROUGH THE- HAPPENED HE WHICH IS THROUGH THE COUNTIES AND I THINK DIRECTLY TO COUNTY SOME NOT SURE ABOUT CONTINUE MATURES YOU COULD ANSWER THE ONE ABOUT TEEN JUNIOR JERRY MINUTE- BUT WHAT- I'VE OBSERVED IN MY OWN DISTRICT IT MAY BE HAPPENING IN SOME OTHER PLACES STATE THAT THERE ARE A FEW CITY THAT ARE. LOW THE REST OF DELEGATION FOR HOMELESS FUNDING BUT HAVE LARGE TOTAL NUMBERS OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS VERY LARGE NUMBER POPULATION OF AND SHELTERED RESIDENTS IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE SAME ACCESS OR THE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED FOR THE QUANTITY OF UNSTRUCTURED PERSONS IN THEIR JURISDICTION AND THEY'RE NOT SEEING THE- THE ROOMS AND SUCH BEING UTILIZED FOR DOES RESIDENTS. SO AFTER IF IT'S SO WE COUNTIES OR CAN MUCH ALSO BUT WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO IF THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY LOOKING INTO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. YES SENATOR SKINNER I FIRST OF ALL ON THE FUNDING AND AS YOU POINTED OUT AND TELL US FOLLOW AT THE SAME MODEL THE HOT MODEL AND THAT INCLUDES CITIES COUNTIES AND CONVENIENCE OF CARE I'M ITS REMEMBER MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS COOK WHO CAN TALK MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. THE ALLOCATIONS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT JURIST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHEN YOU MENTION. THANK YOU YEAH AS MY COLLEAGUE INDICATED THIS AS ALLOCATION FOR THAT THE COLD AND- THE HUNDRED MILLION WAS. CONSISTENT WITH THE POINT IN TIME COUNTS THAT WAS USED. FOR HALF WHICH GOES TO COUNTIES- CITIES AND- CONTINUES OF CARE AND FORGIVE ME JUST CORRECTION CORRECTION IT GOES TO CITY'S. POPULATION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ABOVE. YEAH I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE CASE FOR HE MIGHT BE YES YEAH IT MIGHT BE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ABOVE BUT- I DON'T THINK SO BUT THAT'S OKAY AND I BELIEVE IT'S ONLY. TWELVE OR FIFTEEN TOTAL CITIES BUT KEEP GOING. RIGHT IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH HOW I GET IT HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU THE ALLOCATION SCHEDULE IF YOU'D LIKE- AND AS FOR YOUR OTHER QUESTION I'M SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH THAT LAST QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO THE HOTEL MOTEL AVAILABILITY. YEAH THE POINT THE POINT IS THAT. THE THAT. FORMULA IS A GREAT FORMULA ON THE ONE HAND HOWEVER. EVEN THOUGH IT INCLUDES THE POINT IS THAT. POINT OF TIME COUCH AND THUS THE COMPANIES. OR THE CONTINUUM OF CARE RECEIVE AN AMOUNT ADEQUATE FOR THAT POINT OF TIME COUNTY. IT DOESN'T REFLECT THAT IN THAT POINT OF JAIL TIME COUNTY THERE ARE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF UNSTRUCTURED RESIDENTS IN. VERY SPECIFIC LOCALES WHO MAY NOT BE RECEIVING THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT THROUGH THE COUNTY ALLOCATION FOR THE OUR CONTINUUM OF CARE THE US THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF UNSTRUCTURED PEOPLE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO THESE HOTEL ROOMS AND SUCH. SO IT YOU DON'T NEED TO FURTHER I JUST REALLY NEED TO MAKE A POINT AND I THINK THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU SOME DOCUMENTATION. THANK YOU WILL TAKE YOUR YOUR COMMENT IN. THANK YOU. OKAY AND THEN ON THAT ALSO THAT ISSUE WE HAVE UNDER THE NORM A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE RELEASED FROM OUR STATE PRISON FACILITIES. AND ARE WE DID INCREASE THAT OR- RATHER- MOVE UP A FEW PEOPLE- IN OTHER WORDS THE OUR CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENTS DID ALLOW FOR RELEASE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THEIR NORMAL TROLL DATE IT WAS NOT ANY UNUSUAL RELEASED OTHER THAN. A LITTLE EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ORDER TO BRING DOWN THE POPULATION SOME TO DEAL WITH. THAT YOU HAVE A LARGE CONGREGATE YOU SILLY NOW MY POINT HERE IS THAT THOSE FOLKS. OUR PARTICULARLY ALL IN THE BEST OF TIMES THEY HAVE DIFFICULTIES FINDING HOUSING FINDING EMPLOYMENT NOW IT WILL BE THAT MUCH MORE SEVERE. AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE COMMUNICATED TO CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND COUNTIES THAT THAT RE ENTRY POPULATION IS ELIGIBLE FOR ANY HOMELESS FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED. ON OUR HOMES FUNDING DOES ALLOW FOR IF SOMEONE IS EXPECTED TO BE POTENTIALLY BECOME HOMELESS WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS THAT THEY FIT THE CATEGORY HOWEVER. THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM VERY YES A REENTRY SUPPORT INTO CHEESE AND EVEN SOME OF OUR. PROBATION% OFFICIALS IS THAT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY BEING ABLE TO PUT RE ENTRY POPULATION- ACCESS THOSE FUNDS OR THOSE SERVICES FOR REENTRY POPULATION. SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO IT'S AMY JARVIS CAME THAT CAN SPEAK KID EVERY ENTRY QUESTION AND CONNECTING MEMBERS HOMELESS SERVICES. YES IN YOUR PERSONAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- AS YOU NOTED WE DID PROVIDE SOME EXTRA MONEY INTO THAT- COUNTY PROBATION pPOPULATION GOING TO THEM- UNDER A POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION- PROCESS WE ACTUALLY INCLUDED PROBABLY HAVE MORE MONEY THAN WE INITIALLY ORIGINALLY WHAT HAVE- PARTLY TO ADDRESS HOMELESS IN HOUSING ISSUES- YES WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE. THOSE BEING RELEASED NEED TO BE DIRECTED TO HOUSING AND WE ARE WORKS. OUR INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS TO TRY TO MITIGATE THOSE ISSUES AS THEY COME UP I'M AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE COMMUNICATED THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. AND INDIVIDUALLY BY COUNTY AND THEIR VARIATIONS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE- BUT WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES AND CITIES ARE CONTINUES YOU HAVE A- A RESOURCE LINE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE QUESTIONS AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THEM AS THEY COME UP. OKAY AND THEN ON THE PROJECT HOME- ROOM KEEP PROJECT ROOM KEY. THAT'S IT'S A GREAT UP PROGRAM IN THE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE GETTING HOTEL ROOMS FOR OUR HOMELESS AND HOPEFULLY REENTRY POPULATION OF WHAT I WONDERED IS WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN INCLUDED THE- ABILITY FOR THE HOTEL WORKERS THAT ARE OTHERWISE THEN OBVIOUSLY LOST JOBS. ARE THEY BEING RE EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THIS IF WE ARE PROVIDING US FUNDING TO THE STAR TELLS TO PROVIDE THESE ROOMS ARE THEY UTILIZING HOTEL WORKERS. THIS ALL TURN OVER TEN MARKHAM AGENTS AT HHS. START SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION JUST TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND I THINK YOU'RE SAYING THAT- THE QUESTION IS AROUND WHETHER OR NOT THE HOTEL WORKERS ARE BEING UTILIZED IN THOSE ARE CAL'S. MY UNDERSTANDING. IS THE CASE- CERTAINLY DEPENDS ON TOP. BY HOTEL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING BY AND LARGE IS THAT THEY ARE BEING USED IN THE HEALTH. WE MIGHT WANT TO GET SOME. CLARIFICATION ONLY BECAUSE- FOR EXAMPLE UNITE HERE WHICH IS MY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OR- THE- UNION THAT REPRESENTS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HOTEL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. HAS NOT SEEN THAT SO WE MAY WANT TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION. BY THEN- I WANT TO GO BACK TO A QUESTION OR POINT THAT- BOB WHITE HOUSE YOU MADE ABOUT BE DEBT COLLECTION AND I'M NOT SURE. WE OF COURSE CAN'T- CONTROL WHATEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES BUT I KNOW THAT BOTH THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL OFTEN IF THERE IS THE DEBT EITHER FOR FINE STRAINS FRACTIONS OR PARKING TICKETS AND SUCH. THAT AS SOON AS FUNDING COMES INTO A PERSON'S BANK ACCOUNT THEY WILL OFTEN SHOCKED THAT AND I THINK RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT IS NOT CHAPTER JUST BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION PEOPLE ARE FACING. YES UNDERSTOOD AND ONE ADDITIONAL POINT I WANT TO MAKE IN A RECENT CONSENT ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON THIS IS SPECIFIC TO IN THAT COURT SYSTEM OF COURSE THEY ARE MAKING THEIR DECISIONS THAT THEY HAVE THAT MADE CHANGES IN THIS REGARD WITH REGARD TO- COLLECTIONS IN ELECTIONS IN THE COURT SYSTEM BY ASKING YOU YOU CAN CALL UP. SORRY ABOUT THAT TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. I'M THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID I'M I'D TAKE SEVERAL EMERGENCY ACTIONS I'M JUST LAST WEEK MANY OF THEM WENT INTO EFFECT ON MONDAY APRIL THIRTEENTH WHICH INCLUDED THE SUSPENSION OF THE ENTRY OF DEFAULT AN ADDICTION CASES. AND SUSPENDED JUDICIAL FORECLOSURES- SO OUR HOPE IS THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS COMBINED WILL HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR CURRENT HOUSING. AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- ANYTHING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES- BUT THAT THEY THINK THOSE ARE REALLY THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD- LOOK TO AS- I'M HELP. THREE I MAY. THIS YEAH MICHAEL WASN'T SO MUCH ABOUT THE- HOUSING- IN TERMS OF FORECLOSURE OR DIRECT PROTECTIONS THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROVIDED BUT RATHER. HE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAP BEING BANK ACCOUNTS FOR INFRACTIONS ARE FINE SIR FEES THAT ARE OF. SO THIS IS INDIVIDUALIZED BY COUNTY AGAIN FIFTY COURTS FIFTY DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THAT SOME COUNTY SAID CONTINUE DOING SOME COLLECTIONS- BUT MOST ARE NOT- BUT THEY ARE DOING SOME WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE DOING IN OUR DIRECT GOING IN DIRECT TO BEING TAKE BUT THERE ARE SOME- COLLECTION STOPPING TRAFFIC IS PRETTY MUCH SHUT DOWN. AND THROUGHOUT ALL COURTS AND BUT SOME OF THESE OTHER AND LONG LONG STANDING I DEBT COLLECTION ACTIVITIES HAVE CONTINUED BUT AND NOT VERY MANY COURTS AND WE CAN GET BACK. WITH MORE INFORMATION IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. THEN ON DECK COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES I NOTICED THAT THE SECTION ONE OF THIS SECTION THIRTY SIX. LETTERS PROVIDED FORTY ONE MILLION FOR ADULTS INGENIEUR RESIDENTIAL SOMEBODY'S OBVIOUSLY SEEING. INCREASING CASES AND VERY VERY TRAGICALLY DEATHS AD MANY OF THOSE I WONDERED IF HOW. BUT IF WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT SPENDING. AND WHAT I'M MORE. I THINK OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE INCREASED DEATHS IN THOSE FACILITIES AND- I UNDERSTAND FROM IT FROM. SOME LEADERS AND WITHIN THIS SECTOR THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THE GUIDANCE STATUS GIVEN IS ADEQUATE- SOME WONDERING ABOUT THE LEVEL OF SPENDING SO FOUR OF THAT ALLOCATION AND WHETHER THERE'S GOING TO BE INCREASED GUIDANCE REJECT THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE UNDER THE SAUDIS. YES THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO ADAM DORSEY WHO CAN SPEAK TO IT AND THEN PERHAPS AFTER AND MARCO AS WELL. HELLO AT HELLO ADAM DORSEY FINANCE THAT SO YEAH. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH AND THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA- IN REALLY THAT MONEY IS THERE ARE TWO- I'D TEAMS TO GO INTO THESE. CITIES WHEN- THEY'RE IN. AS RESIDENTS THAT ARE SYMPTOMATIC MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP THESE FACILITIES ISOLATE AND WHEN WE CAN'T ISOLATE- TO QUARANTINE AND MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE MINIMIZING THE SPREAD IN THESE FACILITIES- IS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN A VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION- AND SO- ABSOLUTELY- THAT'S WHY THE INVESTMENT IS THERE AND WHAT. WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN IN THIS AREA I'M I'LL HIN LOFT MARCO AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD ON THAT HARD AND TO ALSO TALK ABOUT THE GUIDANCE. THANK YOU. FOR THAT QUESTION SO THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS AREA AND I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE BECAUSE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS ARE. VERY VULNERABLE FOR AREN'T COPING NINETEEN OUR FIRST WEEKEND UP QUITE A SERIES OF TEAMS TO EACH ONE OF THE FACILITIES THAT ARE I DON'T AND SENIOR CURRENT THAT ARE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. INITIALLY WHEN APPOINT PEOPLE IN THE FIELD NOW WE'VE BEEN DOING HOWEVER THE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE REACH EVERY SINGLE FACILITY TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE THEM WITH. A ROUND. OUT APPROPRIATE. ALL BUT ALSO NEED SOMEONE DOES TEST POSITIVE IN THE- HOW DEAL WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL AND WHAT IT IS A PART OF GERMANY CAN PROVIDE TO THEM. WE HAVE BEEN ISSUE A SERIES OKAY DOCUMENTS WERE HOW TO UP WITH YOUR- MIND YOU A LIST OF. AND STOCK YOU SO. SHOULD IF YOU HEARING FROM FOLKS I'M FOR MORE. TIME WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT I WORK WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY PROACTIVE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING NURSES. HELP THESE PARTICULAR RESULT IN MANY INSTANCES THESE ARE SMALLER AND SO THE PRINTER STAYS BAD. OR LASSEN SO MAKING. SURE THAT THEY HAVE. CALL I JOIN SURE PAYMENT AGAIN KIND OF DISEASE VIRUS WITHIN A PARTICULAR WORK. THANK YOU WILL PASS ON ANY COMMUNICATE REFER SEVE AND THEN BETTER INSURED COUPLE QUESTION. BUT UNDER DIFFERENT GONNA JUST GONNA AT IF YOU TRY TO KNOW IT PLEASE AYE AYE LOSE. I NEEDED. TO COMMENT BY ABOUT TEN TO SIX AND I'VE GOT TWO MORE MEMBERS OF FLEETWOOD RAPID ABOUT APPRECIATED. CERTAINLY HAVE TRIED TO STAY WITHIN THE SECTION THIRTY SIX ITEMS. I'M IN THE MOOD MEALS. ARE THERE WAS TWENTY MILLION OR FOOD NEEDS THAT WAS TWENTY MILLION IN APRIL FIFTEENTH AND- NO THERE WAS TWENTY MILLION INITIALLY AND THEN. I CHEN IN THAT BECAUSE THE TEAM. TO HELP COUNTIES THAT FIRST ONE WAS FOR GENERAL. I GET THANKS THE OTHER WAS FOR COUNTY. TO HELL GET SAM THE ACCESS TO THE- FOOD BENEFITS. I NOTE I THINK ALL OF US EXPERIENCE THAT. MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR SCHOOL SITES ARE. AS WHAT EXPECTED PROVIDING MEALS ARE AND- TO THEIR STUDENTS AND THAT MAY NEED TO CONTINUE THROUGH SUMMER. BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SCHOOL ARE REALLY RUNNING OUT OF FUNDS TO DO SO AND ONE THAT ARE AT ITS USE MAKES DEPARTMENT. AND ADMINISTRATION HAS IN MIND THAT BUT DO THEY ANTICIPATE. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FRIENDS. TO THIS ALL TURN OVER TO MARCO AS WELL WHO CAN SPEAK MOST ACCURATELY TO THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AROUND THE FOOD NEEDS ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR CHILDREN WE'RE GETTING SOME OF THE STEPS. THAT SCHOOL SO THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE THAT WE YOU'LL GO LOOK AT YOUR THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO THE FOOD BANK. WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH CAL FRESH PROGRAM WHICH IS THE FEDERAL SNAP PROGRAM WE'RE DOING A FEW THINGS THEIR- FIRST- WEEK OF COURSE OUT O MERGING SEE A LOT. OF ONE POINT THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THANK YOU YOU SHOULD ONLY WE ARE REQUESTING THAT BIG WAIVER FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ENDEMIC HE HE WHICH WILL ALLOW WESTERN AND ARAB WHO BENEFITS TO CHILDREN WE'RE GETTING SCHOOL MEALS ACTION THERE WOULD BENEFIT ON THE EAST SIDE. YEAH AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE WE ARE WORKING ON WITHIN THE- PROGRAM. I WE HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. EACH YOUNG LEVINE WHICH ALLOW. OUR ARE RECIPIENTS ON THE TWENTY TO BE A TO ENCOURAGE. ONLINE OUR- WITH CERTAIN BE. SOMEWHERE BY THE- GOVERNMENT WE- TO WORK WITH SEAT COLLEAGUES AROUND COULD MEAN ARE JOB. OUR WHO MY BE GETTING GOODNESS. PROGRAMS AS WELL AS OUR VOLUNTEERS ANOTHER WITH PARTNERS I WITH REGARDS TO THE WE BRING BACK WE WHAT DID YOU SOME. IN REGARDS TO BENEFIT AMONG OUR PREFERRED WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND FINAL WITHIN MY OWN- SO. YES STEPS FIVE I HAVE BEEN HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH US YOU SEE OUR SECRETARY SO I'M NOT GOING TO ASK. QUESTIONS THERE OTHER THAN MAKES THE POINT THAT THIS IS OUR LARGEST CONGREGATE. CONGREGATE POPULATION WITHIN THE WHOLE STATE AND THIS LARGE CORPORATE POPULATION IS 1100% WARDS OF THE STATE. AND WHILE THERE ARE AND MANY OWNER ABILITIES WITHIN THAT POPULATION RIGHT NOW THOSE WHO ARE BEING HELD IN THE DORM LIKE SETTINGS. ARE THE MOST EXPOSED THEY HAVE THE LEAST ABILITY TO. TO HAVE THIS SOCIAL DISTANCING THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS AND SO THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY- THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY OF WAYS THAT. WE CAN ADDRESS THAT BUT I. WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING THAT- FIRST AND FOREMOST SO THAT WE ARE NOT WE DO WE DO NOT EXPERIENCED. DEATH SO LIKE WE ARE SEEING UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY OF OUR NURSING FACILITIES AND SENIOR SWORDS- BUT IN THAT. WE ARE JUST ON THE NATURAL BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE PAROLED RELEASING FOLKS INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY BE TESTED BEFORE RELEASED NOT THEN BE HELD LONGER BUT SO THAT WE CAN. ENSURE THAT THEY CAN BE QUARANTINED SO THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING THE SPREAD OF POTENTIALLY AN INFECTION IN ONE FACILITY INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE ENSURE THAT EVERYONE BEFORE. WE NEED MORE TESTING OVERALL NIKKI SO IT IS BUT I KNOW WE NEED IT OVERALL EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE. IT'S. CHEST X. LEAST. UNDERSTOOD SENATOR WE WILL TAKE THAT BACK TO SEIZE YOUR THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK ON THAT. AND THAT'S ALL THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU THIRTY SKINNER VERY MUCH SENATOR DOLLY. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD TO SEE YOU MADAM CHAIR ISSUED PERSON SOON I HAVE A- DROP OR QUESTIONS I WANTED TO PER SE. THAT THERE WAS THAT POPULATED AS SENATOR SKINNER TALKED ABOUT THE POPULATION CAP WHICH SHOWED SHE BELIEVED WAS REALLY I THINK IT'S THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS I'M NOT SURE- BUT MOST OF MY DISTRICT DOESN'T FIT UNDER THAT CAP BUT I WAS WONDERING WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO DO THOSE THAT WERE EITHER THREE OR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS YEAH. THE STATE'S. THESE ARE FOR FINANCE I BELIEVE ALL MY QUESTIONS ARE FINANCE. YES I'LL MAKE A COUPLE BRIEF POINTS FIRST I THINK I REALIZED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR SKINNER THERE IS THAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND- FOR THE SPECIFIC TAX PROGRAM BUT THERE'S ALSO AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF THE TIMING ON THIS. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PERSON CASPER LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGE FROM THE CENTRAL SAXON SO THERE ARE A LOT OF CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE BELOW FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT ARE IN. FOR BACK THROUGH A- UNDER THE CAR LAW SO THERE'S NO LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND MAKE UP. VERY AWARE AND WHAT I'M NOT ON PART OF THE NAY. SEVERAL BILLS SO I THINK. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EACH I THINK ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW. THE IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS IN LAST BUDGET THAT WE NOW. PUT IN SOME THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY ON THIS. PART OF IT IS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE BOX BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE COUNTY SAN MONEY DOES. BASED ON THE COUNTY TO ALL THE COUNTIES AND INTERACTIONS MEANS OF CARE WHICH ALSO COVER ALL AREAS OF THE STATE SO. THE FOCUS ON THE CITY'S. IS THAT SPECIFIC CAR OUT OF THE FUNDING IS BASED ON THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY PART OF THE APPLICATION THAT IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING PEARL HOMELESSNESS. I THINK THE BROADER ISSUE THAT WE KNOW IS THAT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S A GOOD START WE HAVE A LOT. MORE TO DO THIS WAS AN ISSUE. TO THE STATE. I WON THE BIGGEST IN THIS. EVEN BEFORE COMING NINETEEN. WE UNDERSTAND OCCURS MORE TO THERE AND I THINK THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IN ADDITION TO THAT. I'M MORE FLEXIBLE FEDERAL AID DOT RECEDING AND IT DID IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT. LARGER SEVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ENTITLED SHOULD BE. THANKS I KNOW THE EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT ARE ONE PART IN IT OR WHAT YOU. THANK YOU YEAH. JUST WANTED TO COMMENT YOU KNOW. SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN. HAD THE OROVILLE DAM CRISIS AND WE GOT THE CAMPFIRE WE'VE SEEN THOSE- NATURAL DISASTERS BUT WE KNOW WHICH WAY THE WIND'S BLOWING WE KNOW WHICH WAS WATER FLOWING WE CAN GET PEOPLE OUT WAY IN THIS CASE WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED THE- OUTCOME IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT AT THE END BECAUSE IT'S WE DON'T KNOW THE DATE SO I WE'RE BASICALLY. THROWING MONEY RIGHT NOW JUST IN PLACES WHERE WE TAKE IS GOING TO WORK AND SO WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THE OVERALL OVERSIGHT. FOR EIGHT OR APPROPRIATE OUT TO LIKE I KNOW WE HAVE A- YES FOR THE HOSPITAL IN IN MY DISTRICT AND NOBODY'S AND HOSPITALS AND SOMEBODY WATCH YOU KNOW. IT BABY ALL IN A WEEK I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE AND WE NEED TO. REDIRECT SOME OF THOSE FUNDS WHAT'S THE PROCESS THAT HIS OVERSEEING THAT ARE YOU. DOING THAT. YES SO WHAT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU KNOW WE'RE THE ONES KEEPING TRACK OF EVERYTHING AND SENDING THE NOTIFICATIONS. TO YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT REALLY IS A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT PROCESS YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS WE WANTED TINA AND MARK ON THE PHONE BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WITH. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH HHS- WE ASK AND OTHER. AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS WE'RE WORKING ON DAIS ON WITH REGARD TO THE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTION YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS- YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT THE- AND MANY JUST AIMS AND TRY TO. ROUTE AND MODEL WHEN HE WILL BE SO THAT WE CAN SEARCH OUR HOSPITAL CAPACITY. I AM RIGHT NOW IT DOES SEEM AND MARCO TO SPEAK MORE TO THIS BUT- WE CERTAINLY- THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR OPTIMISM YOU KNOW IN THE SHORT TERM BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GONNA GO SO. JUST STATE THE OBVIOUS THE FACT THAT. THIS IS FULL. ACCESS TO GOOD THING YOUR WERE WERE HAVE THAT IT'S NOT STOLEN HOPEFULLY WILL GET YOU TO STAY THAT WAY BUT WE DID ONE BE PREPARED. FOR THAT EVENTUALITY AND SHOULD BE THE CASE THAT WE HAVE MORE REASONS FOR OPTIMISM IN THE FUTURE. AND WE CAN START TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY AND ITS FRIENDS OUT THAT. HE STARTS ACROSS THE- WORKS IS NO LONGER NEEDED. WE WERE JACKSON ACCESS LEAD IN TERMS. OUT HOW TO REDEPLOY THOSE RESOURCES WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED AND THAT GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT THIS IS THEIR- DAY TO DAY ASSESSMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAKING. YOU STANDING. IN ABOUT IT EVERY DAY AT NOON IN TERMS OF WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE. SOURCES ALMOST NEED. THANK YOU BUT ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS I WANT TO TOUCH ON IT JUST TWO MORE AND THEN WE'LL WRAP IT UP AND I HAVE A COMMENT- I WANNA TAKE A SITTER CABALLERO FOR TAKING THAT RURAL HOSPITALS AT THE SAME ISSUES THAT SHE HAS THAT SHE CAN TALK ABOUT ARTISTIC AND PHYSICIANS WHO ARE- YOU KNOW. WONDERING WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO IN THE FUTURE SO YOU PARTY TOUCH ON THOSE- BUT WE YOU TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON THE FOOD BANKS AND THE AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A SHORTAGE- GETTING FOOD OUT AND WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE PEOPLE ACCESSING THE FOOD BANK BUT- THE FARMERS ON THE- IN SOME OF. DUMPING AND OF PROCESS. THE FOOD CHAIN PROCESS IS. GETTING JUST ROB IS GONNA BE DISRUPTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND I THINK THAT- AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT AND SOMEBODY WHO'S IN AGRICULTURE BUSINESS THAT. THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE BUILT A BEEN MET LEFT OUT AND- AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT THE- SHE- IS TALKING ABOUT YOUR TONY. FARMERS TO DONATE BUT WE HAVE TO. THE THAT. THE PIPELINE AND BE SURE THAT THEIR MAIN GOAL NOW I THINK THEY'VE BEEN KIND OF SKIPPED OUT SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO. BE AWARE OF. THAT IS. BEING AND YOU CAN'T PROCESS IT IN YOU AND YOU. WORKERS AS A VULNERABLE ONES OUT IF WE DON'T HAVE SOME THE NEXT TO KEEPING THEM. ANYWHERE THE MIDDLE OF THE- SEASON RIGHT NOW WHICH- YOU CAN ARE. PLANS SO THOSE THINGS GOT TO HAPPEN SO JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON THAT. I LOVE. ACTUAL QUESTION WOULD BE. A LOT ABOUT. WHATEVER APPROPRIATING MONEY WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING AND WE HAVE AND HOW THE BADGER REACTING TO IT AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE BASICALLY CREATING MONEY. PAST THEY CAN'T PREDICT FASTER AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THAT LUXURY IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO PRINT MONEY WORK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME SHORTFALL THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT. WHAT WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THE OUT HOW WE CAN STIMULATE BUSINESS SOMEBODY YOU. I MYSELF IS IN BUSINESS AND I'VE BEEN. TALKING ABOUT THE REGULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA NOW- HOW DIFFICULT IT IS THE IN THE BUSINESS I'M YOUR WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT WHAT IS YOUR GOAL OR WHAT WHAT DO YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO. TRYING TO HELP BUSINESSES. BE ABLE TO RESTART AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE STARTED TALK ABOUT THAT PROCESS BECAUSE- WE'RE SURE GONNA NEED. FUTURE YES AT ALL STATE TWO THINGS THE FIRST IS THA YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHTON. THE DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN WHAT THE STATE CAN DO AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PRINT MONEY. AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO RUN YOUR LITERALLY IN THIS CASE TRILLION MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT SENSE AND- IN OUR CASE. THE RAINY DAY FUND MECHANISM ALLOWS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF COUNTER CYCLICAL POLICY WHERE. WE CAN SEND MORE. ON THESE ISSUES INCLUDING THOSE THAT YOU'RE NOT LINES WHEN THE ECONOMY DECLINES BUT ONLY UP TO A CERTAIN LEVEL AND YOU'RE NOT CONTROLLING ARE OWN CURRENCY- SO THEY ARE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN WE ARE AND WE ARE CERTAINLY. CAN DO A LOT AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE BEST WITH WHAT WE HAVE. IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'VE BEEN SO CASE WITH FEDERAL. I BROADER QUESTION YOU RAISED ABOUT WE- DO. A SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS SPENDING THAT. GOVERNOR'S FOCUSED ON AND I THINK THIS IS ONE THAT REALLY CROSSES DEMOGRAPHIC IN PARTY MINDS IS TO FOCUS. ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY MAKING SURE THAT. THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE ARTISTS. AND YOU KNOW MAY NOT ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A VOICE. IN WASHINGTON AND OREGON IN IN DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS COUNCILS ARE GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED SO. CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'VE BEEN IN VERY CLOSE TOUCH. WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING THEIR OFFICES THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES ONE THING THAT THEY'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. YOUR CREDIT FOODS PEOPLE HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH JUST THAT ACCESS THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM AND THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THESE ECONOMIC INJURY. DISASTER LOANS UNDER SEVEN A LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. AND YOU KNOW. THIS IS START CRISIS PEOPLE ARE REALLY HAVING TROUBLE EVEN JUST GETTING ON THE PHONE SO I THINK IN THAT SMALL BUSINESS AREA AND THE GOVERNOR HAS ANNOUNCED. SOME INITIATIVES. TO HELP PEOPLE GET FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THESE ARE ALLOCATED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT MONEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE. APPROPRIATED OFFERING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT BANK I TO HELP SPECIFICALLY THOSE BUSINESS. THAT FOR A VARIETY REASONS MIGHT NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO THE FEDERAL. AND MORE GROW. AND IN HE'S SIGNAL THAT HE'S GONNA SPEAK MORE ABOUT THIS IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS THE COMICS THINKING ABOUT USING THEM EVEN AS WE'RE CONFRONTING IMMEDIATE. HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HOW DO WE START THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE. THE OUT A AND THEN I THINK THE LAST THING I'LL SAY WHICH IS SOMEONE EDUCATION NOT EXACTLY A SMALL BUSINESS ISSUE BUT CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT MATTERS FOR WORKERS. IS I THINK YOU'VE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS THE FRUSTRATIONS NATIONWIDE ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING ACCESS TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WHICH IS BEEN MADE MORE GENEROUS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ACTUALLY GETS INO PEOPLE'S. BANK ACCOUNTS SO WHETHER IT'S EXTENDING THE HOURS J. INCLUDING THE WEEKEND DAYS AND IN ADDITION TO THE WEEK DAYS AND ADDING A HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL WORKERS. FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION. DEPARTMENTS I THINK THAT IS AN AREA WHERE THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO MAKE SURE TO HELP YOU. ALSO TRYING TO DO IS JUST AND WE KNOW OUR SCHOOLS ARE LIMITED COMPARED TO THE- GOVERNMENT'S BUT CERTAINLY MORE THAT WE'RE. GONNA ADVOCATE FOR AND- WELL I JUST. THAT THEY Q. FOR THOSE STEPS AND I KNOW THAT I WANT TO COMMEND THE GOVERNOR I THINK THAT. HE'S DONE SOME GREAT THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A LONG TIME FOR EXAMPLE. NURSES WHO WERE WAITING ON LICENSES HE WEIGHED THAT AND SOMETHING WE DIDN'T. THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES I WOULD JUST SAY FOR. US TO STIMULATE BUSINESS BY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS TO GET WHERE THEY NEED TO GO TO EMPLOY PEOPLE AND TO AND TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS IT IMPROVE OUR ECONOMY SO I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THAT. LOOK FOR MORE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ALONG WAITED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AGAIN THANK YOU THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS THANKS CHAIR APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR ROTH.

A REDUCTION OF CRAP. YOU AS PRACTICES ARE NON COLBERT RELATED. AND THEIR PRACTICES THE VIABILITY OF PRACTICE IS IN QUESTION.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOKS MORE THAN JUST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUT A SMALL BUSINESS THE RELIEF PROGRAM TO DO SO AND SO MINISTRY FINANCE I CERTAINLY YES YOU WILL YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IS.
