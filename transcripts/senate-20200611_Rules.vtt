00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.285
BEFORE US LET ME TALK A LITTLE

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:03.386
BIT ABOUT OUR APPROACH IN OUR

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:04.954
TECHNIQUES GOING FORWARD.

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:07.023
CERTAINLY WE HAVE THE US CENSUS

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:10.193
BUREAU DATA WHICH SHOWS AS

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.395
WHERE WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:13.997
IN TERMS OF LOW RESPONSE RATE

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:15.298
AND SO WE'RE NEARING OUR

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:16.766
STRATEGIES AND OUR FOCUS WITH

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.201
THERE ARE WHICH PARTNERS. TO

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.470
THOSE CENSUS TRACKS- AND WE

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:22.272
DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:24.440
IS TEN MILLION DOLLARS LEFT AND

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:26.409
WE WANT TO ALLOCATE AT LEAST

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:27.610
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. IF YOU

00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:28.812
ARE OUTRAGE PARTNERS TO

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:30.446
CONTINUE THEIR EFFORTS I

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.981
ESPECIALLY WITH THE EXTENSION

00:57:32.048 --> 00:57:34.417
OF THE CENSUS CAMPAIGN- A

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.219
STRATEGY THAT WE THINK WILL BE

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:37.754
VERY BENEFICIAL FOR ALL OF US

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:39.355
AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK. IS

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:41.157
HOLDING BACK SOME DOLLARS SO

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:42.659
WHEN THOSE LAST FEW MONTHS WHEN

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:44.928
IT'S SO CRITICAL IF WE NEED TO

00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:46.996
MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS OR WE NEED

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:49.265
TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:52.435
WE NEED TO FIND COMPLEMENTARY.

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:54.404
TECHNIQUES ARE HIS I WILL THE

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.739
FINANCE RESOURCES TO DO SO- IN

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:58.174
ADDITION- LIKE I MENTIONED

00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.743
EARLIER WE DO HAVE A DASHBOARD

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.145
THAT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:04.447
OF US. TO TRACK THIS REAL TIME

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.049
SO THAT WE CAN REACT AS QUICKLY

00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:08.218
AS WE NEED TO. WE KNOW HOW

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:10.153
CRITICAL IT IS TO MAKE SURE WE

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.221
HAVE A COMPLETE COUNT IN THE

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:13.489
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY
