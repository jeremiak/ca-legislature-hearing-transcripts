BE THAT I HAVE SPENT THE BETTER

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:52.498
PART OF THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS

TRAVELING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.767
WORKING WITH. VIRTUALLY EVERY

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:57.536
STATE. ON HOW TO FIGURE OUT

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:58.771
THIS SORT OF CONUNDRUM WE'VE

00:08:58.838 --> 00:08:59.305
GOTTEN GOTTEN INTO WITH

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.974
OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING. IN THE

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:02.608
COSMETOLOGY AND BARBERENA

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.011
ARENA. I'M A BIG PORTION OF IT

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:06.545
IS THAT MY BACKGROUND IS NOT IN

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:09.282
COSMETOLOGY MY BACKGROUND IS IN

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:12.618
OR SEEN AND MICROBIOLOGY SO. MY

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:14.253
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN AT REFOCUSING

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.522
US ON WHERE LICENSURE WAS MEANT

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:17.690
TO BE WHICH IS AND HEALTH AND

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.659
PUBLIC SAFETY. SO I'VE HELP

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.127
STATES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:23.162
WITH REVISING THE RULES. THEIR

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.798
CURRICULUM AND NOW A LOT OF

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.366
STATES LOOKING AT REVISING WHAT

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:30.102
THEY'RE REQUIRING AS ENTRY

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:30.736
POINTS. THE CRITERIA FOR ENTRY

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.371
INTO THIS CAREER FIELD. PUT

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:33.105
TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT OF THE

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:35.841
HISTORY OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.009
THEIR OUT THERE RIGHT NOW ALL

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.978
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SOME OF THE

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:40.746
TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:42.682
THE COUNTRY IS PRESSURE

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:48.154
LITERALLY IN EVERY STATE. TO

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.326
REDUCE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSURE.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.860
SCENE THE MOST COMMON THING I

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:55.394
HEAR IS GOVERNOR'S WHO ARE

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.896
GIVING A 30% REDUCTION. THEY

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:58.597
WANT 30% ACROSS THE BOARD

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.232
PAPERWORK. OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:02.134
WHATEVER YOU CAN DO TO REDUCEBY 30% SEEMS TO BE A NUMBER

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:02.768
THAT IS PRETTY PREVAILING

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:05.137
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO LOTS OF

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:05.771
STATES ARE MAKING AN EFFORT TO

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:07.540
REDUCE BOTH THE RULES ON THEIR

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:08.574
CURRICULUM AND ALL THEIR

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.476
LICENSURE BY ABOUT THIRTY

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:11.978
PERCENT. THE CHANGING JOB

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.946
MARKET I HAVE UP THERE WHICH IS

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:17.149
KIND OF INTERESTING. IN AND OUT

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:17.750
OF CAN PROBABLY SPEAK TO THIS

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:19.952
LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT- THE

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:20.686
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:23.923
ESTIMATING THAT IN THE NEXT TEN

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.324
YEARS. WE'LL SEE SOMEWHERE

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:26.225
AROUND FORTY MILLION PEOPLE

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.594
WITHOUT A JOB BASED ON.

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.364
AUTOMATION ROBOTICS AND-

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.765
ARTIFICIAL OR- ARTIFICIAL

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.400
INTELLIGENCE. AND THOSE PEOPLE

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.035
OUT BE OUT LOOKING FOR JOBS AND

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:37.470
WHEN YOU'RE THIRTY SEVEN WITH A

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:38.337
MORTGAGE AND THREE KIDS IT'S

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:40.239
KIND OF DIFFICULT TO GO AND

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.207
SPEND ANOTHER FOUR YEARS GOING

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:43.342
TO GET A UNIVERSITY DEGREE. SO

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.777
THERE ARE SOME PRESSURES IN

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:47.146
THAT REGARD A TOWARDS WHAT WE

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:48.581
WOULD HAVE CALLED LOCATIONS IN%

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:49.482
THE PAST TO TRY TO GET THE

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:51.417
BEARS ENTRY LOWERED. SO THAT

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.084
MORE PEOPLE HAVE CAREER

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.787
OPPORTUNITIES AND THOSE FIELDS.

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:57.023
ON AND THEN MOST STATES THAT

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:58.357
COMING OUT TRULY FUNDING HONEST

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.059
THEY WANT TO HAVE A PREEMPTIVE

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.861
TO THE DEREGULATION. RISK THEY

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:03.162
WANT TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:03.929
SO PEOPLE DON'T COME IN AND

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.498
TRYING TO DEREGULATE THEM

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.066
ENTIRELY. SO IF I'M BEING

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:07.967
TOTALLY HONEST THAT'S WHY A LOT

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:08.567
OF STATES COME OUT TO TRY TO

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:09.969
HELP THEM SO THAT THEY DON'T

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:11.837
IT'S A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE.

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:14.573
BEFORE SOMEBODY COMES IN AND

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.975
GET THE BILL SUCCESSFUL

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:19.078
SUCCESSFULLY. TO DE REGULATE

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:21.847
THEM. SOME OF THE THINGS I'M

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:22.481
SAYING THE MOST COMMON THING IS

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:25.351
SEEN AS PRODUCTION HOURS. NEW

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:30.156
YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS. HAVE

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:30.756
ALWAYS HAD A THOUSAND HOURS AS

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:37.530
THEIR. TWO POINT AND SO TO

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:38.197
TESTING THOSE TO STATE THAT THE

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:38.864
THOUSAND HOURS TO BE CLEAR

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:40.533
MASSACHUSETTS. IS THE NUMBER

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:41.434
ONE MOST ON OUR STATE ON TO FOR

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.301
JUSTICE LIST AND THAT IS

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.869
BECAUSE- IT'S A THOUSAND HOURS

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:44.637
AND IN THE CLASSROOM BUT THEY

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:45.738
ALSO REQUIRE. TWO HOURS OF

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:46.572
APPRENTICESHIP OR TWO YEARS OF

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.573
APPRENTICESHIP ON TOP OF THAT

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.241
SO. IT DOES BECOME MUCH MORE

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:50.309
LIKE THE PROCESS BUT I'M GONNA

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.377
SHOW YOU WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:51.944
CHANGE THAT MASSACHUSETTS.

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:52.745
WHICH IS KIND OF INTERESTING.

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:53.779
TEXAS VERMONT INTO A THOUSAND

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.981
HOURS THIS YEAR ON TEXAS

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.083
DOESN'T TAKE PLACE UNTIL.

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.517
NUMBER TWENTY. BUT THAT'S BEEN

00:11:58.584 --> 00:11:59.351
INTERESTING TO WATCH THAT

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:00.419
CHANGE OVER ONE OF THE

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:01.487
INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT TEXAS

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.421
IS THEY'VE BEEN DOING A

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:03.022
THOUSAND HOURS AND THEIR HIGH

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:04.824
SCHOOL PROGRAM. FOR EVER AND SO

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.259
IF YOU WERE TO DECIDE AT

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:07.726
SIXTEEN I WANT TO BE A

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:08.994
COSMETOLOGIST YOU COULD GO FOR

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:09.795
THOUSAND HOURS. GET YOUR

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:11.130
CERTIFICATE AND GRADUATE AND

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.232
BECOME A COSMETOLOGIST. IF THE

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.233
DAY AFTER YOU GRADUATED HIGH

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.234
SCHOOL YOU WANT TO BECOME A

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:17.503
COSMETOLOGIST TO KEEP FIFTEEN

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.004
HUNDRED HOURS SO. THAT WAS SORT

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.339
OF THERE WAS A- SORT AN EASY

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.741
TRANSITION FOR THEM. FLORIDA IS

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.810
GOING TO TWELVE HUNDRED HOURS

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:25.411
ELEVEN STATES TO REDUCE THEIR

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.012
HOURS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:28.447
THAT REDUCTION MIGHT NOT BE

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.149
SIGNIFICANT SOME STATES HAVE

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.250
GONE TO TWENTY FROMTWENTY ONE

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:32.918
HUNDRED HOURS. TO EIGHT HAN

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:33.786
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HOURS BUT

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:35.754
THEY'RE STILL STARTING TO

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:36.789
REDUCE AND THEN WE HAVE EIGHT

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:37.323
STATES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:39.592
LOOKING TO REDUCE THEIR HOURS.

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:40.559
MOST OF THEM WERE TRYING TO GET

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:45.531
TO A THOUSAND. THAT IS SEEMS TO

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:46.098
BE THE GOAL THAT EVERYONE'S

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:52.671
TRYING TO GET TO. NOW. SOME OF

00:12:52.738 --> 00:12:54.039
THE OTHER METHODS OF LICENSURE

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:54.607
THAT ARE GOING ON OUT THERE

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:56.542
THAT WERE SEEN. IN

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.977
MASSACHUSETTS. NEW AND

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.445
INNOVATIVE. THEY'RE HAVING A

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.113
FEW ISSUES WITH IT AND I'M

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.647
GOING TO BRING UP WHAT THE

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:02.548
ISSUES ARE WHEN THEY DO ON.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.349
THEY HAVE A PROGRAM NOW WHERE

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:04.717
THEY SPEND SIX HUNDRED HOURS IN

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.352
THE SCHOOL AND FOUR HUNDRED

00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:08.254
HOURS. ARE IN A PAID AND I ONLY

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.888
PAID BECAUSE THAT'S SIGNIFICANT

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:09.688
FOR THEM. A PAID

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:10.823
APPRENTICESHIPS SO THAT

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.590
STUDENTS AND GO OUT AND WORK.

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:13.492
NOT IN A SORT NOT IN A SCHOOL

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:14.960
SETTING BUT OUT IN A SALON

00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:16.262
SETTING WHETHER. A PRACTICE BY

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.297
THE- ASSEMBLY SALON OWNERS. THE

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:19.165
REQUIRED TO BE PAID DURING

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:21.133
THAT. TIME PERIOD. SO THEY'RE

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.036
STARTING TO. YOU KNOW ON WHILE

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:26.071
THEY LEARN TYPE OF CNCEPT. THE

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:26.872
BIGGEST PROBLEM THEY'RE HAVING

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:27.773
WITH IT IS THEY WOULD SAY THE

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.774
CAUTIONARY NOTE THERE IS TO

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:30.042
HAVE GOOD OVERSIGHT EVERY

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:31.644
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. I

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.711
HEARD PRESENTATION BY AN FBI

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:33.913
AGENT COUPLE YEARS AGO ABOUT

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:34.980
HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND-

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.715
APPRENTICESHIP SEEM TO BE A WAY

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.050
A LOT OF. HIM TRAFFICKING CASES

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:39.218
ARE FUNNELED INTO THE STATE'S.

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:40.319
SO REAL CAUTION WITH THE

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:42.121
OVERSIGHT ON THAT WAS WHAT THEY

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:45.858
WOULD TELL YOU. OREGON HAS BEEN

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:46.959
DOING COMPETENCY BASED

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:47.526
EDUCATION INTESTINE THEY'VE

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:52.731
OFFERED IT FOR A NUMBER OF.

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:59.939
YEARS WHAT THEY HAVE. EVERYBODY

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:00.573
I TALKED TO THE WORKING PEOPLE

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:01.640
OF WORK WITH IN OREGON. THE

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:02.141
GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:03.542
STUDENTS PROCEED AT THEIR OWN

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:04.710
PACE BASED ON WHAT THE COMPANY

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:05.511
SAYS SO ARGUABLY YOU COULD

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:07.046
FINISH SCHOOL. MUCH SOONER IF

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.514
YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCE

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.083
MORE READILY. YOU COULD ALSO DO

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.219
COMPETENCY BASED TESTING THAT

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:13.786
WOULD ALLOW STUDENT THAT IS

00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:17.856
VERY. IS ABLE TO FINISH IN A

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:19.225
VERY MUCH SHORTER TIME THAN

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:19.858
SOMEBODY WHO REQUIRES A LITTLE

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:20.526
BIT MORE. THEIR BIGGEST

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:21.093
CHALLENGE IN THE REASON ONLY

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.095
ABOUT TWENTY SCHOOLS ARE 20% OF

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:27.900
THE SCHOOLS OFFER. COMPETENCY

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.235
BASED EDUCATION AN ORGAN IS

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:30.402
BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL AID SO

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.670
IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET FINANCIAL

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:35.107
AID FOR THE STUDENTS AND SO. ON

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:39.111
THEY HAVE A DROP OFF OF

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:39.712
STUDENTS WHO WANT TO DO THAT I

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:41.714
KEEP LOOKING YOU TO CHANGE JUST.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.248
THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST

00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:42.781
POPULAR THING EVERYBODY'S

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:43.482
LOOKING AT AND ORGAN HAS BEEN

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:44.450
DOING THIS ACTUALLY SINCE TWO

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:45.384
THOUSAND AND EIGHT. YOU WOULD

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.086
KIND OF NOT BY THE WAY THAT

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:49.221
THEIR STRUCTURE REALLY WORKS.

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.557
BUT STACKABLE LICENSES IS

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:53.292
REALLY WHAT I HEAR OTHER STATE

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:55.327
WANTING TO TALK ABOUT DOING. AN

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.962
IN OREGON THEY TOOK AWAY THE

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:58.063
COSMETOLOGY UMBRELLA LICENSE

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.732
ENTIRELY THEY THERE YOU CAN'T

00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:01.300
GET IT BACK BECAUSE LICENSE IN

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.335
OREGON ANYMORE. YOU KNOW GET A

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.537
HAIR DESIGN LICENSE WHICH ALSO

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:06.005
INCLUDES CHEMICALS AYE

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.539
BARBERING LICENSE AND AESTHETIC

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:08.173
LICENSE OR NAILS LICENSE YOU GO

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.941
IN AND YOU DO THE ONE THING.

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:09.742
THE ONE AREA THAT YOU WANT TO

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:10.509
WORK IN. AND THEN YOU CAN GO

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.011
BACK AND GET ANOTHER LICENSE

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.513
AND YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GET ALL

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.585
FOUR OF THE LICENSES. BUT YOU

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.053
DON'T TO YOU DO YOU DO NOT. GET

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.855
ONE COSMETOLOGY LICENSE.

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.023
OBVIOUSLY THAT REDUCES A

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:24.757
BARRIER TO ENTRY BECAUSE NOW I

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:26.825
CAN GO AND GET A NAILS LYSONS

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:27.593
IN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE HOURS

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.794
AND SEVENTY OPERATIONS. ON A

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:29.995
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.096
LAST TIME AND SIGNIFICANTLY

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:32.865
LESS MONEY. IF ALL I EVER WANT

00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:35.234
TO DO IS NAILS. THEY'VE TAKEN

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:37.036
HELP THE PUBLIC SAFETY OUT OF A

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.237
GENERIC CLICK FOR EXAMPLE

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:39.805
CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE A HELP THE

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:40.372
PUBLIC SECTOR AN INFECTION

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:41.740
CONTROL. ON NUMBER OF HOURS

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.409
THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO DO. IN

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:44.677
ORGAN WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS EACH

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:46.445
OF THOSE SEPARATE LICENSES HAS

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:47.513
ITS OWN HEALTH AND PUBLIC

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.682
SAFETY OR INFECTION CONTROL

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:51.583
COMPONENT. AND IT IS BASED

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.585
SPECIFICALLY. ON THAT THE

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:55.854
PRACTICE. ONE OF THE THINGS

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:56.522
THEY WOULD TELL YOU AS A

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:59.558
CAUTIONARY TALE THE STATE WOULD

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:00.392
TELL YOU THAT'S NOT THE SCHOOL.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.960
BECAUSE OF I TALKED SCHOOL THAT

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:04.630
TIME IS FOR THE STATE IT. IS

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:05.264
THAT THERE'S A TENDENCY TO WANT

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.198
TO BUNDLE THESE AT THE- SCHOOL

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:08.567
LEVEL. SO THAT BECAUSE FOR

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.704
EXAMPLE THAT THE NAILS AND THE

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.805
AESTHETICS BY THEMSELVES. WOULD

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:13.405
NOT QUALIFY. FINANCIAL BATES.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.406
BUNDLE THEM. SO WHAT ENDS UP

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.308
HAPPENING IS BETTER THAN FIFTY

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.444
PERCENT. OF THE STUDENTS TODAY.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:26.051
CAN ARE GOING THE FULL.

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:26.585
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AND

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:27.086
BASICALLY. GETTING A COP

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:35.394
LICENSE BUT. DELTA THERE THERE.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:36.061
THERE'S AN INSIDE THEM TO COULD

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:39.064
NOT TOGETHER SO. THERE ARE SOME

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:39.631
CAUTIONARY TALES AND HOW TO

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:40.199
MAKE THAT WORK A LITTLE BIT

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.835
BETTER. THIS IS SORT OF THE

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:43.702
OVERRIDING PROBLEM THAT I WOULD

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.404
SAY THAT WE HAVE IN HOW WE DO

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:47.172
LICENSING TODAY. IS THAT THIS

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:48.107
IS HOW MOST OF OUR CURRICULUM

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.042
SO TODAY. ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:51.910
THAT IT NO MATTER WHAT MY CAR

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:53.078
80% OF MY HOURS SEEM TO BE IN

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:54.813
THE HAIR INDUSTRY. AND 20% SET

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.648
AND NAILS AND SKIN. BUT THIS IS

00:16:56.715 --> 00:16:57.516
THE RISK THAT WE SEE OUT THERE

00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:58.117
FROM HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.451
PERSPECTIVE THAT THE VAST

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.652
MAJORITY OF INJURIES THAT WE

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:02.588
SEE. COME OUT OF THE NAIL AND

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:06.225
THE SKIN MARKET. AND THE FEW

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:06.859
THAT COME OUT OF HER MARKET ARE

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:11.563
ALMOST ALWAYS CHEMICAL RELATED.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.299
AND SO. THERE DOES NEED IN MY

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.034
ROOM IN MY ESTIMATION NEED TO

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:16.635
BE SOME DRIVE TOWARDS GETTING

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:20.572
TOWARD. ADDING TO REGULATE

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:21.807
STARTING TO WRITE CURRICULUM

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.475
STARTING TO MAKE THE ENTRY TO

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.811
THIS PROFESSION BE BASED ON HOW

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:26.378
DO I. MITIGATE THE RISK OF

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:27.946
WHERE THE RISK REALLY LIVE

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:28.547
LET'S REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:29.915
LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT WHERE THE

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.150
RISKS ARE. THERE ARE REAL RISK

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:31.784
IN THIS INDUSTRY BUT LET'S BE

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.918
HONEST WHAT THEY ARE AND LET'S

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:34.219
START THERE AND LET'S WORK FROM

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:37.723
THAT POINT. ON THE FEDERAL

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.826
CONVERSATION WHICH I THINK MATT

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:41.560
MATT WAS THAT HE WAS IS GOING

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:42.995
TO GET TO I'LL PREFACE IT A

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:43.962
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE HE WAS

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.596
GETTING READY TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:45.764
AWESOME OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.533
EDUCATION CONSORTIUM. AND WHAT

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:48.500
THAT WAS WAS A JOINT EFFORT

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.269
BETWEEN NCSL IN THE DEPARTMENT

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:54.339
OF LABOR AND THEY TOOK I THINK

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.040
IT STARTED TEN STATES I THINK

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:55.574
IT AND NOT BEING EIGHTEEN

00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:58.277
STATES. MADE SOME TEAMS AND WE

00:17:58.343 --> 00:17:59.077
LOOKED AT THIRTY LICENSE

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.579
OCCUPATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:02.781
AND IT WAS REALLY A SURVEY PUT

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:04.783
A BEST PRACTICE DURING WHAT

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.253
COULD HAPPEN WHAT HAPPENED I

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.421
DON'T BRING IT UP. ONE NUMBER

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:10.656
OF MARYLAND HOME TEAM HAS THAT

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:11.957
I WAS SELECTED FOR THE HOME

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.392
TEAM BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.027
COSMIC COSMETOLOGY BARBERING WE

00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:16.628
ALSO LOOKED AT PLUMBING HVAC

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:17.763
AND REALTORS AND THE MARYLAND

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.364
TIME TEAM. THERE ARE TWO THINGS

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:19.932
THAT WERE TAKE AWAYS FOR ME

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:20.566
THAT I THOUGHT WERE SIGNIFICANT

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:21.200
ONE IS THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.100
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OUT AND

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:23.402
THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ABOUT HOW

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.603
HARD SOME OF THESE JOBS WILL BE

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:25.704
TO FILL IN THE COMING YEARS

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:26.438
SAID THAT NOBODY WANTS THEIR

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:27.773
KID TO NOT GO TO A FOUR YEAR

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.408
UNIVERSITY THAT IS EVERY.

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:30.776
PARENT'S NIGHTMARE ACCORDING TO

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.044
THESE PEOPLE THAT THEIR CHILD

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.846
WILL NOT USE IT FOR YOUR

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:34.613
EDUCATION AT THEIR CHILD CHOOSE

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.914
A LOCATION SO THAT WE DO NEED

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:38.517
TO MAKE THESE OCCUPATIONS WE

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:39.318
NEED TO KEEP THEM I IN MY

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:40.853
OPINION STRUCTURED WE NEED TO

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:41.787
KEEP THEM AT A VIABLE

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.489
ALTERNATIVE. A LOT OF TIMES

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:44.990
WHEN A STUDENT COMES HOME AND

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:46.458
SAYS I WANT TO BE A PLUMBER I

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:47.426
WANT TO BE A COSMETOLOGIST

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:51.063
WHATEVER THOSE THINGS ARE THE

00:18:51.129 --> 00:18:51.964
TO DISAPPOINTMENT AND THIS IS

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.365
WHAT I HEARD FROM HIS MEDIAN IS

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:53.899
A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THEIR

00:18:53.966 --> 00:19:03.542
PARENTS AND I THINK KEEP. IT A

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:13.819
LITTLE MORE ON THE. THING AND I

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:14.653
GET TO GO TO WORK SOONER I

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.587
DON'T HAVE TO SPEND ALL THIS

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.990
TIME. THEY WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:18.957
AND THEY REPORTED MORE JOB

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.893
SATISFACTION IN THE LONG TERM.

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.661
BECAUSE THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:23.495
AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.330
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A TYPICALLY.

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:26.365
A WELL ESTABLISHED IN THEIR

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:27.666
LIVES THERE TYPICALLY IN THESE

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:29.301
CAREER PATHS IN THEIR EARLY

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:30.869
TWENTIES. THEY JUST WANT TO GET

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.037
TO WORK THEY WANT TO DO THIS

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:34.306
THING SO. WHAT WE CAN DO TO GET

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:35.741
THEM OUT FASTER AND LEARNING.

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:37.242
ON THEIR FEET. WHAT I'M A

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:39.311
NURSE. AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:40.512
TO BE YOUR NURSE ON MY FIRST AT

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.680
A NURSING SCHOOL I WAS NOT

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.215
GREAT. I LEARNED THE VAST

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:44.449
MAJORITY OF I LEARNED ABOUT

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:45.784
BEING A NURSE BEING ON THE

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.252
FLOOR RIGHT I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.120
LEARN IT ON SCHOOL I LEARNED A

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:50.556
LOT IN SCHOOL BIG PREPARED ME.

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:51.189
FOR WHAT I LEARNED ON THE FLOOR

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:52.891
SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT GET TO

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.594
WORK. ON AND WHAT. THERE IS A

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:56.662
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR REPORT

00:19:56.728 --> 00:19:57.729
THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED. IT

00:19:57.796 --> 00:20:01.233
MIGHT BE RELEASED THIS WEEK.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:01.767
AND I WAS REVIEWER ON THAT

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:05.437
REPORT. AND WHAT THAT REPORT. I

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:06.638
CAN ONLY SENATE JORDAN GENERAL

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.740
SENSE IS GOING TO. SUPPORT AT

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.275
AM IS LICENSURE FOR THE HELP

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:11.910
THE PUBLIC SAFETY ASPECT. OF

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.812
WHAT. WHAT IS DONE IN THIS

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.581
FIELD. AND CERTIFICATION FOR

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.416
THE TECHNIQUE AREAS SO WHEN WE

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:18.951
START TALKING ABOUT HOW TO

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:19.551
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING NOT DO

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:20.852
THEY DO IT SAFELY WHEN WE SAY

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.120
HOW DO YOU DO IT. THAT WOULD

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:23.789
BECOME MORE OF A CERTIFICATION

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:26.992
A TECHNIQUE. ISSUE VERSUS A

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:30.062
LICENSURE ISSUE. LIKE I HAVE TO

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:31.263
SAY THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE REAL

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.965
RISKS THERE ARE REAL RISKS IN

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.032
THE REAL RISK THESE ARE THE

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:35.200
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD I COULD SHOW

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:36.435
YOU REALLY NASTY PICTURES MAKE

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:37.970
YOU ALL GO GROW I MEAN I'VE-

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:39.137
HUNDREDS OF DISGUSTING PICTURES

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:41.206
ON MY COMPUTER. I USED TO WORK

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:42.541
ON THESE ON AIRPLANES AND TELL

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:43.475
PEOPLE SITTING NEXT TO ME GAVE

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.544
ME DIRTY LOOKS. BUT THESE ARE

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.779
THINGS THAT ARE NOT UNCOMMON

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:48.480
RIGHT A CHEMICAL BURN FROM

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:49.448
SOMEBODY GETTING A HAIR COLOR

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:52.184
SERVICE. A MIKE THIS IS

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.219
ACTUALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:55.520
MICROPLATE THE EYEBROWS OR SEEN

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.456
DOWN HERE ON THE BOTTOM. MOST

00:20:57.522 --> 00:20:58.690
PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT EVEN NOT

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.325
EVEN IN EVEN REGULATED FIELD

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.327
BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG FOR

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:05.030
STATES TO CATCH UP WITH WHAT.

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.431
GOES ON OUT IN THE REAL WORLD

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:07.466
THE BY THE TIME THE STATE RIGHT

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:11.003
TO RULE PEOPLE OF ALL SORTS ARE

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:13.739
ALREADY DOING THIS. THIS ACTIS.

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:14.973
AND CREATING ALL KINDS OF HAVOC

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.607
AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:16.708
DO SEE STATES FACING IS THAT.

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:18.677
AND ONE OF THE REASONS I'M OF A

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:19.211
PROPONENT OF KEEPING SOME

00:21:19.277 --> 00:21:21.613
LICENSE FROM PLACE. IS THAT.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.714
WHAT I'M NOT A COME TELL JUST I

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.082
DON'T OFFEND ANY COSMETOLOGIST

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:25.717
SITTING BEHIND ME. BUT THE

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:26.785
REALITY IS THEY COME UP WITH

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:28.387
SOME REALLY DUMB IDEAS. THEY

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:29.788
THAT ARE PAID THAT HURT PEOPLE

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:31.089
RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE TO KEEP

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.290
OUR ARMS AROUND IT WE HAVE TO

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:33.792
BE ABLE TO SAY. NO YOU CAN'T DO

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.394
THAT IF YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.695
DO IT THIS WAY. IN ORDER TO BE

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.797
SAFE SO IS RUSTY WHAT WAS THE

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:40.065
PROCEDURE BEING DONE THE

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:43.535
EYEBROWS MICRO GERMAN LINE ON

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:47.139
THAT. MIKE MY KERN MICRO

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:49.808
PLANING ON EYEBROWS. MICRO

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:51.843
BLADING ITS THE BLADE THAT THEY

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:52.444
RUN THROUGH THE EYEBROWS AND

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:53.945
THEY- PUT. SOME KIND OF A

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:54.579
PIGMENT IN THERE AND IT MAKES

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:55.681
EYEBROWS AND THESE OTHER I GET

00:21:55.747 --> 00:21:57.249
HUNDREDS OF THESE. LITERALLY

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:58.183
HUNDREDS OF THESE PICTURES A

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.985
MONTH. PEOPLE SENDING ME THOSE

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:01.653
INJURIES. BUT IN MOST STATES

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.021
THEY CONSIDERED NON REGULATED

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:04.556
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY

00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:06.058
REGULATED YET IT'S KIND OF A-

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:09.895
NEW. SORT OF A NEW TECHNIQUE SO

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:12.230
IS THAT A TATOO. IT IS A FORM

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:13.198
OF ATTACH IT'S NOT IT WOULDN'T

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:14.132
FALL UNDER THAT YOUR TATTOO

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:18.403
REGULATIONS. SO IT'S A FORM OF

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.904
TATTOOING THAT WOULD NOT

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.473
FOUNDER TATTOO REGULATIONS AND

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.075
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON TATTOOING

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.010
BUT- ISN'T THERE A LOT OF

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:25.844
REDNESS AND SORENESS THAT

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:27.612
HAPPENS IT TO. SOME OF THESE

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:30.048
ARE VERY LONG TERM INJURIES SO

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:31.183
MANY PEOPLE HAVE LITTLE IN

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:32.250
THESE TACKLE END UP WITH A YEAR

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:34.052
JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE CS ONE

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:34.886
UNDERSTAND OF THE ONE ON THE

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:36.521
TOP RIGHT I DO WANT TO BE THE

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:37.355
ONE OF THE TOP RATED YOU WANNA

00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:38.356
SPEND A SECOND ON BECAUSE THIS

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:40.358
IS SOMETHING WE FORGET WHEN WE

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:41.426
TALK ABOUT WHAT SOMEBODY GETS

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:42.828
EDUCATED ON A COSMETOLOGY

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:44.062
SCHOOL. AS A LADY HAD A

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.565
MASTECTOMY FOR BREAST CANCER.

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:49.167
AND GOVERNOR ELSTON AND

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:50.802
SOMEBODY USED A NOT PROPERLY

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:52.704
DISINFECTED EMPLOYMENT ON HER

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.940
AND SHE NOW HAS PERMANENT

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:56.341
DAMAGING TO HER LEFT ARM IS

00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:57.976
MUCH LARGER THAT HER RIGHT ARM.

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.344
AND PATIENTS THAT HAD

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:01.313
MASTECTOMIES MONTH ACTIVITIES

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:02.547
ONE BATMAN CARE CAN MAKE THEM

00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:05.584
PERMANENTLY HAVE. REALLY JUST

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.420
FIGURING OUT COMES AND SO SOME

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:09.454
OF THESE THINGS ARE JUST THINGS

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:10.789
THAT WE SHOULD BE TEACHING WE

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:12.924
SHOULD BE XIN OUT TO THE PUBLIC

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:18.263
WE. SHOULD BE TEACHING THE

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:18.864
CONSUMER BUT ALSO BE SPENDING

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.701
TIME ON IT. I MET THE WOMAN WHO

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.035
HAS LIVED A DAM AND HER ONE

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:24.669
RIGHT ARM WAY SIXTY POUNDS ONE

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:25.570
ARM WAY SIXTY POUNDS. SHE'S

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:26.671
DISABLED FROM WORKING SHE I

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:27.205
MEAN SHE HAS ALL KINDS OF

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:28.273
DISABILITY. AND HERS CAME FROM

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.608
A MANAGER SITUATION SO ALL OF

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:30.308
THESE THINGS ARE REAL RISK

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:31.343
THERE I'M NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:32.811
SHOW YOU THAT CRAZY THINGS ON.

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:33.445
YOU KNOW THERE'S LITTLE THINGS

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:34.346
THAT HAPPEN IS BIG THINGS

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:35.814
HAPPEN ON THE OTHER IN. RARE

00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:38.450
CIRCUMSTANCES. I'VE TESTIFIED

00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:40.285
WRONGFUL DEATH CASES BUT- I'VE

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:43.822
ASSOCIATED. WITH THOSE OF THE

00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:44.389
RARITIES THESE OF THE COMMON

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:44.956
THINGS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:46.758
THE SAM. IF I CAN INTERRUPT

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:47.726
YOU AGAIN I'M ALWAYS WELL WAS

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.361
SOMEWHAT WARY ABOUT ANECDOTAL

00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:51.563
INFORMATION EVEN PICTURES BUT-

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.299
CAN YOU SPEAK TO. ME SAY THIS

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:56.568
IS COMMON. I GOT A PRECAUTION

00:23:56.635 --> 00:23:58.303
FLIGHT SAY WELL. YOU GOT TO

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.671
GIVE A CONTEXT IS THERE ANY

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:01.306
CONTEXT YOU CAN GIVE TO. THAT

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:02.908
THAT'LL GET YOUR RIGHT IN WHAT

00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:04.209
I WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY IS

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:05.310
IT THESE ARE THEM SORT OF

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:06.578
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD THINGS IF

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:07.512
YOU WERE TO TALK TO THE

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:10.182
LICENSING. THE BOARD IN ANY

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:13.952
STATE. AND THEY WERE TO SAY WE

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:14.553
GOT FIVE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS OF

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.454
INJURY THIS YEAR. THE VAST

00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:17.789
MAJORITY ARE GONNA FALL INTO

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:18.390
THINGS LIKE THIS A CHEMICAL

00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:20.325
BURN OKAY. USUALLY THESE ARE

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:22.194
ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE THINGS

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.495
THAT CAN HAPPEN IS NOT A

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:25.997
REFLECTION ON. WHETHER IT'S 1%

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:26.832
OF THOSE WHO HAVE THOSE

00:24:26.898 --> 00:24:29.801
PROCEDURES OR- 10% OR FRACTION

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:30.969
OF A PERSON THAT'S VERY ALSO

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:32.604
DIFFICULT TO TELL BECAUSE-

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:34.372
QUITE FRANKLY. A LOT OF FOR

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:35.707
EXAMPLE THE SCROLL DOWN ON THE

00:24:35.774 --> 00:24:37.175
BOTTOM RIGHT. THIS IS AN

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:38.810
INFECTIOUS PROCESS SHE HAD HER

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:40.378
EYEBROWS WAXED IN TWENTY ELEVEN

00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:41.179
THIS IS HOW SHE LOOKED IN

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:43.415
TWENTY FOURTEEN. BUT IT TOOK

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:43.982
AWHILE FOR THE INFECTION TO

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:45.417
TAKE PLACE RIGHT SHE GOT THE

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:47.919
SHE WAS EXPOSED TO THE- TO A

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:50.589
BACTERIA. SHE GOT AN INFECTION

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.123
AND BY THE TIME SHE WENT TO THE

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.191
BOARD IN THE STATE SHE WAS AND

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:54.192
THEY SAID WELL YOU KIND OF GOT

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:55.794
MY SUMMER ELSE. THERE IS A

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:58.597
DISASSOCIATION IS NOT UNLIKE IF

00:24:58.663 --> 00:24:59.631
I TRY TO COME HERE AND TELL YOU

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:00.765
THAT PEOPLE GET FOOD POISONING

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:01.933
RESTAURANTS AND YOU ASKED ME TO

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.835
GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER. I CAN'T I

00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:06.271
CAN'T DEFINITIVELY SAY I GOT IT

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.372
FROM THIS RESTAURANT BECAUSE I

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:08.440
GOT SICK TWELVE HOURS LATER SO

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:10.075
I CAN GIVE YOU NUMBER BUT WHAT

00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:11.476
I CAN SAY. IS THE NUMBER THAT

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:13.612
ARE REPORTED. OUR IS PROBABLY

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:14.713
UNDER REPORTED FOR THE NUMBER

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:16.214
OF INJURIES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:18.250
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:19.184
AGAIN CORRELATION BETWEEN THE

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:20.952
TWO THINGS. THAT MAKE SENSE ONE

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:21.753
THING IT DOES FOR THE THAT

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.355
PEOPLE FALL OFF OF THANKS DOES

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:24.689
THAT MAKE BICYCLE RIDING ON

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.291
SAFE. AND THEN WE LOOK FOR

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.960
CONTEXT THERE RIGHT. AND IS WE

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:30.629
MAKE THEM DECIDE ABOUT LAWS

00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:32.797
REGULATING HELMETS WE TRIED AT

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.199
LEAST HAVE SOME CONTEXT. I

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.600
THINK WHAT'S DIFFERENT I GET

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:36.401
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I THINK

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:37.535
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS IN

00:25:37.602 --> 00:25:39.237
A LOT OF OTHER. LICENSED

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:41.406
OCCUPATIONS. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:46.111
SAYING IS IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:46.711
PUT YOUR HANDS ON OTHER OTHER

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:49.648
PEOPLE STRANGERS. AND USE ALL

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:50.715
KINDS OF THINGS CHEMICALS

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:51.883
MACHINES ALL KINDS OF THINGS ON

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:52.951
OTHER HUMAN. IF I RIDE A BIKE

00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:54.452
AND I FALL OFF. IT'S ME AND MY

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:55.253
BIKE RIGHT IN AND I'VE I AM I

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:55.820
HAVE TO RIDE MY BIKE SAFELY

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:57.355
IT'S MY DECISION. BUT WHAT

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:59.257
WE'RE SAYING IN IN THE BEAUTY

00:25:59.324 --> 00:25:59.791
INDUSTRY IS WERE ALLOWING

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:02.694
PEOPLE. SOMETIMES PEOPLE THAT

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.262
ARE MAYBE NOT EVEN VERY WELL

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:07.165
EDUCATED TO. THERE WERE USING

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.034
THINGS AT THE LABELS MIGHT NOT

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.936
ADEQUATELY REFRESH THE ****

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:11.536
WITH THAT PRODUCT CAN DO SO I

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:12.537
THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:15.740
BETWEEN YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD THE

00:26:15.807 --> 00:26:16.708
ARGUMENT FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT I

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:19.611
CAN GO BY HER COLOR TARGET. AND

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:20.612
THAT HAVE TO A LICENSE PLATE ON

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:22.547
WHAT THE COLOUR TARGET ALL I DO

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:23.782
IS MAKE TWO THINGS TOGETHER

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:25.684
THERE IS NO QUESTION HOW I DO

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.285
IT RIGHT HOW I MIX THOSE TWO

00:26:27.352 --> 00:26:28.320
THINGS TOGETHER I DON'T HAVE

00:26:28.386 --> 00:26:30.288
ANY DISCRETION ON WHETHER I USE

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:34.025
MORE OF A CHEMICAL OR NOT SO I

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:34.526
THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT

00:26:34.592 --> 00:26:36.094
DIFFERENT. IF OKAY IN ALL

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:37.562
FAIRNESS OR NOT AND THEN LAST

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:38.596
BUT NOT LEAST I DO THIS IS

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:40.265
PROBABLY THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:41.499
EVER WRITING THINGS PEOPLE

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:44.769
FORGET AND THAT IS. RECIPROCITY

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:49.374
IF I IF A PERSON IN CALIFORNIA.

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:50.942
IT'S A LICENSE AND LET'S SAY IN

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:52.177
ANY STATE LET'S SAY A STATE

00:26:52.243 --> 00:26:53.878
GOES WAY LOW LET'S. TAKE A FIVE

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:55.180
HUNDRED HOURS. PART OF BEING

00:26:55.246 --> 00:26:57.349
ABLE TO MOVE AND CONTINUE YOUR

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:58.483
EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER STATE IS

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.684
TO GET A LICENSE IN ANOTHER

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:00.852
STATE BECAUSE- EVEN IF

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:01.586
CALIFORNIA WERE TO MAKE A

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:03.321
CHANGE. FIRST OF FORTY NINE

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:04.222
OTHER STATES OUT THERE THAT

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.024
STILL HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR

00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:07.325
ENTRY INTO THEIR STATE TO

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.728
BECOME LICENSE. A PERFECT

00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:11.763
EXAMPLE OF THAT IS IN FLORIDA

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.164
THEY MOVED THEIR NAIL AND

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:15.600
AESTHETICS. TURNED ME INTO A

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:16.735
CERTIFICATION INSTEAD OF A

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.370
LICENSE. AND NOBODY WILL ACCEPT

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.772
AS THE ESTHETICIANS OR NOW TAX.

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:21.973
IN ANY OF THE OTHER STATES TO

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.774
COME WORK THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:24.542
NOT LICENSED. OR CERTIFIED. SO

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.544
THERE ARE THINGS TO CONSIDER

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:27.112
I'M NOT SAYING YOU CAN YOU

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.213
CAN'T DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.314
DO. BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.516
WHAT IT DOES TO YOUR CURRENTLY.

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.718
LICENSED PEOPLE AND ALL THOSE

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:34.452
YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.787
LICENSE OR WANT TO WORK AS A

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:37.222
COSMETOLOGIST. IF THEY WANT TO

00:27:37.288 --> 00:27:38.790
LEAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:40.225
RIGHT THAT DOES BECOME OF. A

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:42.694
BIGGER ISSUE. I WOULD ALSO SAY

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:43.628
THAT INCLUDES OUR MILITARY

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:44.896
FAMILIES. IMMIGRANTS ALREADY

00:27:44.963 --> 00:27:46.364
HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS RIGHT

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:47.432
MOVING FROM ONE STATE TO

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:49.267
ANOTHER AND ALL OF THOSE GROUPS

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.703
OFPEOPLE WILL BE. WHAT

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.104
DIFFICULTY LEAVING THE STATE OF

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:55.173
CALIFORNIA IF THEIR CAREER PATH

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.677
IS. AS A COSMETOLOGIST FOR

00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:03.048
BARBER. AND STARTING OUT. AND

00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:03.681
THEN THIS IS JUST MY EXPERIENCE

00:28:03.748 --> 00:28:04.182
MY LAST SIGH THIS IS MY

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:05.150
EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH OTHER

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:05.683
STATES WHAT HAS MADE FOR

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.251
SUCCESSFUL CHANGE WERE HAVE

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:07.185
STATES HAD PROBLEMS. THAT THEY

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:08.086
DID NOT PERCEIVE THE FIRST ONE

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:09.621
IS. JUST I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

00:28:09.687 --> 00:28:11.189
TO HAVE A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:11.856
WHICH APPEARS LIKE YOU'RE

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:13.058
ALREADY DOING TAKE THE TIME TO

00:28:13.124 --> 00:28:14.959
DO THE RIGHT THING. WHEN STATES

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:17.529
DO THINGS TOO QUICKLY. THERE%

00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:20.198
SEEMS TO BE A LOT LACK OF.

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.933
LOOKING AT HOW ALL THE- PLAYERS

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.769
FIT INTO IT. THIS SECOND ONE

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:25.937
HAVING A SINGLE AGENCY TO

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:27.772
PROVIDE. OVERSIGHT OVER ALL THE

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:29.541
ASPECTS. WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MANY

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:31.142
AGENCIES INVOLVED THAT'S ONE

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:31.810
THING I'VE SEEN A LOT OF STATES

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:32.944
LIKE IT TOO MANY AGENCIES

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:34.546
INVOLVED. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:35.513
YOUR THINGS THAT FALL TO THE

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.581
CRACKS THERE'S NO NOBODY WANTS

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:38.550
TO BE. NOBODY'S ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.051
ANYONE THING AND SO HAVING ONE

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:41.453
AGENCY HAVING OVERSIGHT. AND

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:42.387
THEN UNDERSTANDING OBVIOUSLY

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.788
THE FINANCIAL ISSUES FOR ALL

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:46.157
THE STAKEHOLDERS. ANTICIPATING

00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:47.759
THAT COMING IN WITH A SOLUTION

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:49.527
TO SAY WE UNDERSTAND. FOR THE

00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:51.096
STUDENTS FOR THE SCHOOLS FOR

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:51.863
THAT OVERSIGHT AGENCY THERE

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:52.564
WILL BE SOME FINANCIAL

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.567
CONSIDERATIONS. AND WHAT DO WE

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.001
FOUR SEE IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:58.203
TO GIVE THEM THE ANSWER BUT

00:28:58.269 --> 00:29:02.407
WHAT WE FORESEE. AS BEING AWAY

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:02.974
TO MEDICATE THOSE FEARS. AND

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:07.846
THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.747
OF FOR THE TESTIMONY OF I DID

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:11.883
HAVE A COUPLE FOLLOW QUESTIONS.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.452
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT RECIPROCITY

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:16.921
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE STATES.

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:19.858
ARE THEY BASED ON ANY CERTAIN.

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:22.961
REQUIREMENTS SAME TYPE OF TEXT

BOOKS US INTENT OF CURRICULUM

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.532
HOW IS THAT RIGHT RECIPROCITY

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:30.268
SO IT WORKED OUT REALLY IT IS

00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:31.569
THERE IS A MAP THAT THE

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:33.404
NATIONAL COUNCIL COUNCIL STATE

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:34.572

ABLE TO SHOW IT AT SOME POINT.

00:29:36.374 --> 00:29:38.576
AND IT SHOWS THE DESPITE THE

00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:40.545
VAST DISPARITY OF ALL AMONGST

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:41.713

EIGHT STATES OF THE START

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:52.684
REALLY EVERY STATE UNTIL WE GET

CREATE THEIR OWN EXAM SOME

00:30:59.490 --> 00:30:59.991
STATES HAVE PRACTICAL SOME

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:03.094
STATES DOWN. IT'S A THERE'S NO

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.096
CONSENSUS AROUND THE COUNTRY OF

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:05.730
HOW TESTING IS HOW EVEN TESTING

00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:09.400
IS DONE. SO AND I GUESS IN

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.269
CALIFORNIA WE USE THE NATIONAL

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:15.106
EXAMS AS AND I SWEET TO ME. AND

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:17.408
SO WHY NOT JUST THAT. YOU KNOW

00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:19.244
IT. I GUESS TEACH FOR THE TEST

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.012
IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO POSE

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.347
THE QUESTION BUT- WHAT WHY WHY

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:24.048
NOT JUST HAVE. A SET THE

00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:25.016
STANDARD OF PASSING THAT

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:27.819
NATIONAL EXAM. AND IF YOU CAN

00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:29.921
DO THAT JUST. IF YOU IF YOU

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:31.089
WANT TO BE A LAWYER IN

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.290
CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:33.024
TO LAW SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA

00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:34.492
RIGHT TELL I'M NERVOUS AT THE

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.194
PAST YOU HAVE TO PASS THE STATE

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:38.196
BAR. RIGHT AND THEN YOU CAN

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:40.798
PRACTICE AND- DO SOME STATES

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.700
PROVIDE THAT AS AN ALTERNATIVE

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:43.801
SIMPLY THAT YOU PASSED THE

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:45.870
STANDARDS. AND THEREFORE YOU

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:47.338
CAN YOU GET THE LICENSE. THAT'S

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:49.340
VERY LIMITED SO THERE IS BEEN A

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:53.044
LOT OF TALK AT THE CONSORTIUM

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:55.113
GROUPS. ABOUT CONTACT LAW WHICH

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:56.748

ACHIEVE THAT I'M A NURSE AND WE

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:00.518
OPERATE AT A NURSING CONTACT.

THIRTY FOUR STATES PARTICIPATE

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:02.954
IF I WERE TO MOVE TO ANY OF THE

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:04.455
OTHER STATES IT DUMPED US PAID.

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:05.523
I WOULD HAVE OTHER ENTRY

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.993

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:14.399
STATE EXCEPT YET. I WILL SAY

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:17.035
THAT SO IS THERE IS THE ABILITY

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.470
FOR CALIFORNIA TO EAT I MEAN.

00:32:19.537 --> 00:32:21.239
SO CERTAINLY WERE SUBJECT TO

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:26.110
FEDERAL STANDARDS. THAT COME

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:26.678
INTO PLAY BUT DOESN'T SOUND

00:32:26.744 --> 00:32:31.249
LIKE THERE'S A LOT. IS THE ROOM

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:31.849
FOR CALIFORNIA TOOK TO CARPET

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:32.717
SOME PATH IN TERMS OF

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:33.318
COMPETENCY AS THE STANDARD NOT

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:35.887
EDUCATION. YOU COULD CARVE YOUR

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:37.255
OWN PATH IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:38.122
THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES ARE

00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:40.525
GONNA ACCEPTED FOR ENTRY FROM

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:41.326
I'LL FROM SOMEBODY FROM

CALIFORNIA THAT THAT'S MY WHOLE

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.362
POINT THERE THERE IS SUCH A

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:45.730
SORT OF SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE IN

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:46.764
ALL THE STATES THAT IT'S HARD

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.166
TO MAKE EVERYBODY. COME TO AN

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:50.501
AGREEMENT ON WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:51.602
I HEAR THE DRIVER'S LICENSE

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:52.804
ARGUMENT ALL THE TIME THAT I

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.339
GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND I

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:55.973
LIVE IN KANSAS I GET A DRIVER'S

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:56.974
LICENSE IN KANSAS AND I CAN

00:32:57.041 --> 00:32:59.544
DRIVE IN ALL FIFTY STATES.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.612
THAT'S THROUGH CONTACT LAW AND

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.114
THAT IS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:33:03.181 --> 00:33:04.148
IF THIS INDUSTRY CAN EMBRACE IT

00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:07.285
WOULD I THINK I'M WOULD. HELP

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:08.353
THE INDUSTRY IF EVERYBODY COULD

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:10.421
AGREE THAT IF I'M SAFE AND OF

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:11.356
THAT I'M ALSO SAFE IN

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:13.725
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. BUT

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:14.759
THAT'S NOT WHERE IT IS TODAY I

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:15.827
WILL SAY THAT IT'S NOT THERE IN

00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:16.861
HOUSTON AND I'M SENSITIVE TO

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.830
THE RECIPROCITY ISSUE BUT IT IS

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:20.131
ABOUT TRYING TO PROVIDE THE

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:21.366
RIGHT STANDARDS FOR THOSE WHO

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:22.734
WANT TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.737
MOST OF WHOM ARE CALIFORNIA

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:28.005
RESIDENTS OKAY COULD YOU TALK A

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:29.440
LITTLE BIT ABOUT I WANT TO KNOW

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:31.676
ABOUT. PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:34.545
EDUCATION IN THESE FIELDS. WHO

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.581
IS WHO IS WHO WHO'S TRAINING

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:42.120
WHO'S EDUCATING. I IT AND IF

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:42.687
YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE THERE

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:45.857
YOU COULD SHARED BE GREAT. SO

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:46.758
ARE YOU SPEAKING WHEN HE SAID

00:33:46.824 --> 00:33:48.126
PRIVATE EDUCATION VERSUS A

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:48.693
PUBLIC ARE USED WHEN YOU SAY

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.461
PUBLIC ARE YOU TALKING THE

00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:51.829
COLLEGE TYPE EDUCATION OR THE

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:52.563
HIGH SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS I'M

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.164
DONE TALKING ABOUT EITHER ONE

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.866
THAT. THAT THAT AS I UNDERSTAND

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:56.567
IT SO MANY OF THE- THE

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:58.836
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:00.571
OFFERED IN THIS AREA IN

00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:01.139
CALIFORNIA ARE DONE THROUGH

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:04.342
PRIVATE. ENTITIES FOR PROFIT

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:06.511
NONPROFIT. THAT THE VERY FEW

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:07.578
WERE DONE THROUGH OUR PUBLIC

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:10.014
SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:11.883
CERTAINLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IS

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:12.817
THAT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:14.619
UNDERSTAND HAPPENS AROUND THE

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:15.987
COUNTRY THAT THAT IS CONSISTENT

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:16.854
WITH WHAT HAPPENS AROUND THE

00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:19.223
COUNTRY EVERYBODY HAS SOME MIX

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.191
OF THOSE TWO THINGS A LOT OF

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:21.058
STATES ALSO HAVE HIGH SCHOOL

00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:23.127
PROGRAMS. SO STUDENT COULD

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:24.128
ARGUE THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:24.862
SCHOOL AND GET THEIR

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.832
COSMETOLOGY LICENSE AND GO TO

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.067
WORK AND MOST OF THOSE STATES.

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:31.803
I WOULD SAY THERE'S NO. REAL

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:35.206
ANSWER HERE IT IS DEPENDENT ON.

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:37.708
THERE'S GOOD SCHOOLS. SCHOOLS I

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:38.309
MEAN JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:40.044
THERE ARE THERE'S GOOD YOU KNOW.

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:41.813
IF THE STATE REALLY WANTED TO

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:42.747
CLEAN AND THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:44.749
FROM MAKING A NEW. PIECE OF

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:46.384
LEGISLATION IT WOULD BE GETTING

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:47.919
BETTER OVERSIGHT TO SEE

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:49.487
SOMEBODY AND SOME TYPE OF A

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:52.423
AGENCY THAT COULD. THE BAD

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:53.324
SCHOOLS AND GET RID OF THEM

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:54.559
GIVE THEM THAT OVERSIGHT TO BE

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:55.560
ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THERE'S

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:56.861
GOOD SCHOOLS ARE BAD SCHOOLS.

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.930
IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THE

00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:00.097
ONE THING THAT THEY DO BENEFIT

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:02.066
FROM IS THAT BENEFIT FROM A

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:05.903
STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM. AND

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:10.408
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. SEEMS

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:13.110
TO HAVE A THE STRUCTURE AROUND

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.245
THEM THE SCHOOL STRUCTURE

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:15.313
AROUND THEM EVERYTHING ELSE

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:16.013
THAT IS HAPPENING FROM AN

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.382
ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL SEEM TO

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:19.283
HELP THEM GET PEOPLE THROUGH

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.353
AND AT A CERTAIN REGIMENTED

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.288
SORT OF WAY BUT AYE AYES PLACE

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:25.423
IN GOOD SCHOOLS BAD SCHOOLS

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.991
GOOD TEACHERS BAD TEACHERS AND

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:28.025
THAT THE PROBLEM IN MY MIND

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:31.829
ISN'T HE DOES IT IT'S WHO. WHO

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:32.430
HAS OVERSIGHT TO REGULATE THE

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:35.800
GOOD AND THE BAD. I GOT SHOULD

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.969
THERE AYE AYE THERE. I THINK

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:38.569
FOR ME AT LEAST IT'S A LITTLE

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:40.171
BIT MORE THAN THAT YEAH IT'S

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:47.378
ALSO ABOUT. KEEPING COSTS LOW

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:49.280
SO THE PRIVATE SECTOR PROGRAMS

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:51.916
THAT BY THEIR VERY NATURE ARE

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.150
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IF

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:53.751
THEY WERE OFFERED A COMMUNITY

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.687
COLLEGES SO I THINK THERE F

00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:58.656
THERE'S A FEW MORE THE ISSUES

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:01.726
INVOLVED IN. IN THAT CHOICE AND.

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:05.396
AT THE END AND IT DOES. GIVEN

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:07.064
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:09.133
IN PROFESSIONAL CAREERS OUR

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.203
CAREERS IN THESE FIELDS AND

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.005
GIVEN HOW MUCH HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:15.940
ARE ENROLLING IN THOSE PRIVATE

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:18.075
COURSES HERE IN OUR STATE AND I

00:36:18.142 --> 00:36:20.278
LOOK FOR MORE INFORMATION ON

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:20.912
THAT AS WE GO FORWARD WITH OUR-

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:23.514
HEARING PROCESS. IT SEEMS LIKE

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:26.817
THAT IT IT OUR OUR PUBLIC AREAS

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:27.985
OUR PUBLICATIONS IS THE CANARY

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.554
COLLEGES FAILING TO PROVIDE

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.923
THAT CURRICULUM OPPORTUNITY.

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.324
THAT THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING

00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:34.692
A BETTER JOB WE HAVE OVER A

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:35.293
HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN COMMUNITY

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:38.129
COLLEGES. CALIFORNIA AND ARE

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:40.498
THEY BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE-

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.333
THE INTEREST THAT'S OUT THERE.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.935
THE I. D. IT'S ONE OF THE

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:45.736
THINGS THAT I'VE DONE FOR THE

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:46.637
LAST ELEVEN YEARS AS I'VE DONE

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.573
A LOT OF IN SCHOOL ON TRAININGS

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:49.440
ALL GO OUT AND DO INFECTION

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:51.576
CONTROL AND- ON TALK ABOUT

00:36:51.642 --> 00:36:52.777
CHEMICAL SAFETY IN THE SCHOOL

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:53.444
SO I'VE BEEN IN BOTH

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:54.879
ENVIRONMENTS THE COMMUNITY

00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:56.314
COLLEGE TYPE ENVIRONMENT. EVEN

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.648
HIGH SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT AND IN

00:36:57.715 --> 00:37:00.017
THE PRIVATE SCHOOL SECTOR AYE I

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:00.651
DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:01.852
BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:04.789
THE- PUBLIC SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:06.290
IS ANY LESS VALUABLE THAN

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.458
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE- PRIVATE

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:08.159
COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:09.527
THERE'S A COST DIFFERENTIAL.

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:11.329
AND BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:14.131
ALSO THAT THERE IS A

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:17.568
SIGNIFICANT. AMOUNT. THERE IS

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:18.069
THAT THERE'S NOT AS MUCH

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.103
AVAILABILITY OF THE PUBLIC

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:19.670
SCHOOL SYSTEM SO PEOPLE WHO

00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:21.005
WANT TO DO IT TODAY. YOU KNOW

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:21.872
THEY CAN'T GET IN THE PUBLIC

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:23.307
SCHOOL SYSTEM NON GO TO THE

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:24.909
PRIVATE SCHOOL SYSTEM RIGHT AND

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:25.876
THAT RAISES SOME OF THE AREA OF

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:28.045
NURSING. IF THEY'RE NURSING

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:29.614
PUBLIC NURSING OPERAS COOLS ARE

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.916
FULL. YOU UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE

00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:32.984
ARE GOING TO CHOOSE A MORE

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.018
EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE THEY

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.720
COULD ARGUE. THERE'S A HIGHER

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.321
QUALITY LEVEL BUT WHATEVER THE

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:40.992
CASE. IT'S OUT OF AN ABSENCE OF

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:42.460
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE PUBLIC

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:45.096
TRACK. AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:46.430
THAT MAY BE A AT PLAY HERE AS

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:48.399
WELL. LET ME FINALLY ASK YOU

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:50.067
ABOUT THE SLIDE THAT YOU

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:50.935
PRESENTED ON RISK VERSUS

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:53.804
CURRICULUM. WHERE YOU HAD THE

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:55.172
UPSIDE DOWN TRIANGLE SHOWING

00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:57.174
THAT FOR THE FOR THOSE.

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:58.476
PROCEDURES THAT ARE MOST AT

00:37:58.542 --> 00:37:59.610
RISK WOULD PROVIDE THE LOWEST

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:02.213
LEVEL OF CURRICULUM WHAT WHY IS

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:02.813
THAT IF HEALTH AND SAFETY IS

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.914
THE FOR STANDARD THAT I THINK

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:06.183
WE ALL. MUTUALLY SHARE IN TERMS

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.385
OF. MAKING SURE THOSE WHO

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.487
PRACTICE. THESE TRADES ARE

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:13.958
DOING IN A SAFE MANNER. WHY IS

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:14.558
IT THAT THE CURRICULUMS UPSIDE

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:19.697
DOWN IN YOUR VIEW. THAT IS NOT

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:20.464
A QUESTION THAT I FEEL LIKE I

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:21.232
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT WHAT I

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:21.832
WOULD SAY IS I FEEL LIKE. I'M

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:22.733
ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THAT.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.435
IS THAT IF I WANT TO DO NAILS.

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:25.069
FIVE I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO SIT

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:28.406
THROUGH. A HUNDRED HOURS A HAIR

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:29.807
I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO DO THAT

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.042
IF I WANT TO DO NOW IS I SHOULD

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:32.176
BE ABLE TO DO NAILS AND DO IT

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.911
SAFELY AND MOVE ON. BUT I DON'T

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.546
KNOW HOW THAT HOW THAT HAS

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:37.648
OCCURRED I'M NOT SURE OVER TIME

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:38.983
HOW THE CURRICULUM HAS GROWN SO

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.218
MUCH IN THE HAIR INDUSTRY IN

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:42.319
EIGHT STANDARD COSMETOLOGY

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:44.088
LICENSE I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.423
FOR THAT. OKAY ANY FURTHER

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:48.592
QUESTIONS. A DECISION YET THANK

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:49.160
YOU VERY MUCH AND CHOCOLATE

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:51.295
SHOULD BE TO SIMILAR THAT THE

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:52.596
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:53.698
COMBINATION OF THE CURRICULUM

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.499
THOUGH GIVEN THE KIND OF

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:57.234
SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL AID

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.102
THAT ALL COMES WITH AN

00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.603
ASSOCIATE OF IT SO. YOU DID YOU

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.372
WOULD YOU WOULD YOU AGREE AT

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.273
THE OBSERVATION THAT PERHAPS

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:04.809
THAN THE SCHOOLS MAY BE PUTTING

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:06.577
UP THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE TO

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:08.713
FOCUS ON STUDENT GOING TO THE

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:09.947
PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:10.848
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT THE

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:11.615
STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:13.718
CURRICULUM. HELPS TO PROMOTE

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:14.719
THAT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:16.787
THING I'M NOT REALLY PREPARED I

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:17.888
DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW I DO KNOW

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:23.461
THAT PROGRAMS WHERE. IN STATES

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:24.095
THAT I'VE WORKED AND WHERE THEY

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:27.865
HAVE. LOWER OUR OPPORTUNITIES

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:29.266
FOR ENTRY. WHEN STUDENTS CANNOT

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:30.801
GET FINANCIAL AID THOSE ARE NOT

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:31.869
POPULAR CHOICES THAT I CAN SAY

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:32.603
THAT THAT IS NOT DEPEND ON

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.771
POPULAR CHOICES BECAUSE- OF

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.439
THE- THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:37.308
THEM. SURE EVEN THOUGH. THERE

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:39.577
ARE STATES WHERE THERE'S A-

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:41.078
THERE ARE STATES WHERE. BECAUSE

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:42.880
THE HOURS ARE SO LOW. IN SOME

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:45.616
OF THE FOR EXAMPLE FOR NAILS.

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:46.851
ARGUABLY THE IT SHOULD BE

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.853
SOMETHING SOME THEY COULD PAY

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:49.420
FOR YOU KNOW IN A VERY SHORT

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:50.354
PERIOD OF TIME THERE ARE

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:52.590
PROGRAMS THAT DO. THEY SELL

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:54.058
FINANCE THEMSELVES THAT KIND OF

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.827
THING BUT I. I CAN'T ANSWER FOR

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:57.461
WHY THE CURRICULUM GREW THE WAY

00:39:57.528 --> 00:40:00.865
IT DID. YOU KNOW I HAVE NO

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:04.869
ANSWERS. SURE ABOUT ANY OF

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:05.503
OBSERVATION THERE MAY BE ABLE

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:06.737
TO SPEAK TO ANY OF THE ISSUES

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:07.171
WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:08.806
DEMOGRAPHICS AS CERTAINLY IN

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:09.406
THE CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:11.909
LANGUAGE ACCESS AND WITHIN

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:13.210
THESE INDUSTRIES I THINK I SAW

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:14.745
ON THEIR STATISTICS THAT IS

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:16.013
ALMOST THREE TO ONE FOR ASIAN

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.048
LANGUAGES. WE DON'T NECESSARILY

00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:19.416
COLLECT THE STATISTICS ON THAT

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:21.285
OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF LICENSED

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.087
INDIVIDUALS BUT UP THE ACTUAL

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:25.489
TEST TAKERS THAT THREE THE ALL

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:26.857
THE RATIOS ALMOST THREE TO ONE

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.460
IN TERMS OF TAKING THESE EXAMS

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:30.861
IN THE NATION LANGUAGE THERE BY

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.397
THE- HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ASIAN

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:35.199
PACIFIC ISLANDERS MANY INTO

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:37.401
OFTENTIMES RECENT IMMIGRANTS.

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:38.736
SOME OF THESE OTHER COSTS

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:41.806
BEARERS COULD ALSO BE IN EFFECT

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:42.439
TO DO YOU HAVE ANY OBSERVATIONS

00:40:42.506 --> 00:40:44.341
WITH AFFECTED THE INTERACTIVE

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:45.576
BETTER ABLE TO ANSWER THAT

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:46.277
QUESTION FROM WHAT THEY'RE

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:47.478
DOING IN ABOUT A THEY I THINK

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:48.913
THEY GET THEIR LIFE THEIR EXAM

00:40:48.979 --> 00:40:50.581
IN FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:53.284
FIVE EIGHT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.218
AND ONE THING I WILL SAY IS

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.286
THAT YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PROBLEM

00:40:55.352 --> 00:40:57.354
NOT A PROBLEM UNIQUE SITUATION

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:58.956
IN CALIFORNIA SOMETHING THAT

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.691
REALLY NO OTHER STATE HAS YOU

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:04.061
HAVE I GO TO RURAL STATES OR I

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:06.363
GO TO STATES THAT ARE. VERY

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.232
HIGHLY POPULATED SMALL STATES

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:14.238
WITH HIGH POPULATION BASES.

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:14.805
EVERYBODY IS A LITTLE BIT OF

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:19.877
BUT YOU GUYS REALLY HAVE. THE

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:20.444
BEST OF BOTH WORLDS ARE THE

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:21.011
WORST OF BOTH WORLDS FROM A

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:21.645
LEGISLATIVE STANDPOINT BECAUSE

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:22.213
YOU HAVE SO MUCH REAL AREA I

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.347
THINK PEOPLE THE OTHER FORTY

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:24.415
NINE STATES. FORGET HOW MUCH

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:25.049

DEAL WITH. YOU HAVE IMMIGRANTS

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:32.556
FROM FAR MORE COUNTRIES THAN

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:34.158
ALMOST VERY IN A VERY FEW

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:36.026
STATES HAVE AS MANY IMMIGRANTS

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:37.528
AS YOU DO. AND YOU'RE DEALING

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.363
WITH RURAL AND POPULOUS BASED

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:43.801

STATE OF NEVADA. OUR OUR UNIQUE

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:32.808

A GROWING DIVERSE POPULATION.

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:38.548

OUR NEW RESIDENTS NEED. AND IS

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.625
THAT THAT THAT'S ONLY THE THIS

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:50.393

THE ACCESS TO LICENSURE MAY BE

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:09.879
SINCE YOU'RE SEEING CERTAIN

WHAT ARE THOSE TYPE OF THINGS

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:18.187

BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT I I'M

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:41.077
EXPERIENCING IS THE EDUCATIONAL.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:41.644
THE LANGUAGE BARRIER AT THE

TRANSITION INTO THE STATE'S OUR

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:49.418
ARENA OF OBTAINING THAT LICENSE

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:52.288
IS THE DIFFICULTY PRIOR TO THAT

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:52.922
LICENSING STATUS BECAUSE ONCE

SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:22.438
EQUIVALENT OF NOT BEING

WITH THIS THE SENATE STRING AND

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.300
IT'S VERY HARD FOR REGULATORS

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.969
ON INSPECTORS TO DETERMINE

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:55.504

ARE PERMITTED TO MILITARY

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.808

BETWEEN THE LAW IN WHAT IS

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.084

A STATE LICENSE SO IT MIGHT

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:53.181
HAVE A FELONY BLANKET BAN OR

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:54.283
FOR CERTAIN MISDEMEANORS IT

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:56.685

DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS THAT

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:08.196
WE'VE SEEN STATES PURSUE SO

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:10.032
LIMITATIONS ON TYPE OF

CRIMES OR OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.584

HERE IN AMERICA SO UTAH HAS

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:10.505
SAID TO THESE COMPETENCY BASED

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:12.841
ASSESSMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA TRY

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.510
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THESE TIME

LICENSE SO H. B. TWO TWO SIX IS

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:41.870
ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING UTAH'S.%

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:44.639
LICENSING DEPARTMENT TO UTILIZE

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:46.341
COMPETENCY BASED ASSESSMENTS

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:47.642
RATHER THAN THESE THESE TIME

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:49.711
BASED REQUIREMENTS WHICH WOULD

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:52.681
REALLY HELP IMMIGRANTS BE ABLE

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.049
TO PROVE THAT HE'S COMPETENT IN

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:55.817
HIS AREA OFTRADE WITHOUT

HAVING TO. GO THROUGH THE FULL

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:07.762
LICENSURE PROCESS OVER AGAIN.

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:10.065
ON THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:12.434
SOME OTHER STRATEGIES THAT

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.469
WE'VE SEEN STATES PURSUE I

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.770
THINK THE MOST POPULAR ONE JUST

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:16.271
DEVELOPING AN IMMIGRANT

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:17.405
LICENSING GUIDE THAT SECOND ONE

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:18.573
IT'S REALLY LOW COST AND REALLY

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.041
EASY. AND IS ESSENTIALLY JUST

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:20.675
MAPPING OUT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:23.044
IT TAKE AS AN IMMIGRANT FOR YOU

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:23.945
TO RECEIVE A STATE LICENSE AND

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:24.546
YOU'RE GIVEN FIELD. A LOT OF

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:25.780
TIMES ESPECIALLY IF ENGLISH AS

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:28.283
A SECOND LANGUAGE JUST THE

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.052
WHOLE LICENSING PROCESS IN THE

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:33.255
STRUCTURE IN THE STATE IS SO

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.190
DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THAT THEY

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:37.592
JUST GIVE UP ON THE FRONT AND-

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:39.594
AND DON'T PURSUE THAT SO IF

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:40.729
THERE IF THERE IS LITERATURE

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:43.465
AVAILABLE THAT WOULD. CLEARLY

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:46.268
MAP OUT THE STEPS THAT IT TAKES

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:47.502
TO RECEIVE A LICENSE IN THEIR

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.304
GIVEN FIELD THAT WOULD GO A

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:51.039
LONG WAY. AND ALSO YEAH

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:53.008
ESTABLISHING BRIDGE PROGRAMS IN

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:57.712
INVESTING IN. ENGLISH CLASSES

01:21:57.779 --> 01:22:04.386
AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:05.954
REALLY THAT'S THE FIRST TREND

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:08.323
THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STATES

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.924
PURSUE A THESE TARGET REFORMS

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:12.394
FOR. SPECIFIC OCCUPY A SPECIFIC

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:15.997
POPULATIONS OF FOLKS SO SPOUSES

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:16.564
PEOPLE CRIMINAL RECORDS AND

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:19.401
IMMIGRANTS. WE GO TO THE NEXT

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:20.468
SLIDE THE SECOND TRENDS THAT I

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:21.169
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THIS

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:22.604
CONCEPT OF UNIVERSAL LICENSE

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:24.839
RECOGNITION SO WE MOVED TO THE

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:25.640
NEXT SIDE WE CAN SEE THERE'S

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.742
THREE STATES THAT CURRENTLY.

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:30.679
HAVE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION AND

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:31.946
WHAT I MEAN BY UNIVERSAL

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:35.116
RECOGNITION IS THEY WILL

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:38.386
UNIVERSALLY EXCEPT IN OUT OF

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.689
STATE. APPLE CAN THEY WILL

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.023
RECOGNIZE THAT OUT OF STATE

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:45.393
LICENSE SEE IF CERTAIN CRITERIA

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:49.164
ARE MET. AND I WILL KNOW SO OUT

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:50.832
OF THESE THREE PENNSYLVANIA

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:54.069
MONTANA IN ARIZONA. ARIZONA IS

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.471
THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:59.774
A CLAUSE THAT REQUIRES THE

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:02.143
LICENSING REQUIREMENTS TO BE

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.112
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SO THAT'S

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:05.947
KEY BECAUSE IN MONTANA AND IN

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.216
PENNSYLVANIA THEY HAVE THIS

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:10.151
UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION THE LAW

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:12.420
IN PLACE BUT IT STILL SAYS THAT

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:15.156
YOUR OLD STATES REQUIREMENTS

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:18.626
NEED TO BE. SIMILAR TO OURS AND

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:23.298
LICENSING BOARD. WILL REVIEW TO

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:23.898
ENSURE THAT THE REQUIREMENT TO

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:30.972
SIMILAR. ZONA DOES NOT SAY THAT

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:33.174
THEY THEY DO NOT CARE WHAT THE

01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:35.009
OLD STATES REQUIREMENTS WERE

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:35.710
ALL THAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:37.679
THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHED ARIZONA

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.814
RESIDENCY AND PASS AN EXAM SO

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:40.448
WE GO. TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:44.185
SEE. WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:44.919
FOR UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION UNDER

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:46.888
THE ARIZONA MODEL SO ALL ALL

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.491
YOU HAVE TO HAVE PROVEN IS THAT

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:50.425
YOU ARE IN ARIZONA RESIDENTS.

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:52.794
YOU'VE BEEN LICENSE FOR AT

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:56.131
LEAST A YEAR IN YOUR OLD STATE.

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:56.598
YOU COMPLETED ALL THE

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:57.532
REQUIREMENTS IN THE ORIGINAL

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:59.968
STATE. AND IN ANY ERA ZONA

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:01.803
SPECIFIC EXAMS BEYOND THE

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.471
LICENSING EXAMS SO THIS IS NOT

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:05.039
TALKING ABOUT IF YOU'RE

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:05.640
APPLYING TO BE A PLUMBER THIS

THIS UNIVERSAL LICENSE

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:56.357

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:17.712
RECIPROCITY SYSTEM IN PLACE.

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.247
THAT IS THE SECOND TRADE I WANT

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:20.148

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:24.419
RECOGNITION THERE'S A LOT OF

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:27.889
MEDIA COVERAGE ON THIS GOVERNOR

GOING TO RECOGNIZE ALL THESE AT

01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:42.937
THE STATE LICENSEES THAT ARE

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:47.475
APPLYING IN ARIZONA. FOR THE

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:49.477
SURGERY AND I WANTED TO TALK

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:52.347
ABOUT IS. THE STATE A STAB

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:54.482
MACHINE A SUNRISE AND SUNSET

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:56.451
PROCESS. IN SO IT THIS IS

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:57.785
SOMETHING I KNOW THAT THIS

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:59.521
COMMITTEE IS CURRENTLY TASKED

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:01.789
WITH IS HIS SON SETTING. THE

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.124
SUNSET REVIEW FOR THE

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:07.028
COSMETOLOGY BEAUTY LICENSING

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.863
BOARDS SO TO YOU ON THE THIS

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:12.901
SUNRISE AND IS A REVIEW BEFORE

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:14.869
THE BREAK IT BEFORE CREATE ANY

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:16.938
REGULATION SUNSET. IS IT STILL

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.506
NEEDED AFTER THE REGULATION HAS

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:22.410
BEEN HAS BEEN CREATED SO I DO

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:24.312
NOT BELIEVE CALIFORNIA HAS

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:26.147
SUNRISE PROVISION FOR LICENSING

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:32.487
BOARDS BUT- OBVIOUSLY THERE IS

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:33.087
A SUNSET PROVISION ALREADY IN

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:37.325
PLACE. SO WE GO TO THE NEXT

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:39.627
SLIDE WE CAN SEE SOME CRITERIA

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:40.728
THAT STATES HAVE BEEN LOOKING

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:43.398
AT FOR WINTER SUN RISE AND NEW

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:45.833
BOARD TO INTRODUCE A NEW.

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:46.701
REGULATION AND I PULLED THESE

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:48.603
FROM VERMONT FROM THE SECRETARY

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:50.438
OF STATE'S OFFICE THEY HAVE A

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:51.472
REALLY ROBUST SUNRISE AND

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:53.808
SUNSET. STRUCTURE IN THAT STATE

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.177
AND SO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:57.378
THAT THEY ASK WHEN THEY SUNRISE

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:58.913
A NEW BOARD SO IS THERE ON

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.715
REGULATED PRACTICE. THAT CAN

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:05.486
CLEARLY HARM ENDANGER THE

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:06.087
HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE WELL

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:11.092
AND OF. OR WELFARE OF THE

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.027
PUBLIC AND IT'S NOT IT'S THE

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.796
HARM IS RECOGNIZABLE IT'S NOT

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:16.631
REMOTE IT'S NOT SPECULATIVE.

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:17.599
AND THAT THE PUBLIC CAN BE

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.067
REASONABLY BENEFITTED OF

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:20.835
ASSURANCE OF INITIAL AND

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.370
CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL ABILITY

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:22.937
AND THERE'S NO OTHER LESS

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:24.973
RESTRICTIVE MEANS BY WHICH THE

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.608
PUBLIC CAN BE PROTECTED SO

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:28.409
SOMETHING LIKE A CERTIFICATION.

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:31.713
OR REGISTRATION OR MAYBE

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:32.213
INSURANCE OR BONDING OR

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.384
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ON THE

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:37.685
NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE SUNSET

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:38.786
CRITERIA SO THIS IS WHAT FOR

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.421
MINE THE QUESTIONS THEY ASK

01:27:40.488 --> 01:27:42.290
WHEN SUN SETTING ABOARD. IT IS

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:44.525
STILL IN THE INTEREST OF THE

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:45.960
PUBLIC IN FILLING IN FOR

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:47.362
LEGISLATIVE INTENT THEY THINK

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:50.298
ABOUT COST SCOPE OF REGULATIONS

01:27:50.365 --> 01:27:52.300
SO DOES THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:54.235
AND EXPERIENCE THAT WE'RE

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:56.504
REQUIRING IT IS ACT HE COOL TO

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:59.907
THE POTENTIAL HARM. ARE THE

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.042
REQUIREMENTS CONSISTENT WITH

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:03.378
PUBLIC INTEREST IS. AT THE SIDE

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:06.214
PUBLIC OPINION EFFECTIVENESS

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.249
AND COMPLAIN SO ALL THESE

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:10.184
THINGS ARE THINGS THAT THEY'RE

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:11.719
CONSIDERING WHEN THEY SUNSET

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:14.088
ABOARD. AND SO WE MOVED TO THE

01:28:14.155 --> 01:28:16.758
NEXT SIDE WE CAN SEE SEVERAL

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:18.593
STATES THAT HAS INTRODUCED

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.029
THESE SUNSET PROCESSES JUST

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:22.397
THIS PAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:24.432
WE SEEN THE BRASS CAM LOUISIANA

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:26.934
HEIAU. AND THEY HAVE COMMITTED

01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:29.737
TO EXAMINING A FRACTION OF

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.706
THEIR LICENSING BOARDS EACH

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:34.542
EACH YEAR IN NEBRASKA'S EXAMPLE

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:37.945
TO ONE FIFTH EVERY FIVE YEARS

01:28:38.012 --> 01:28:38.579
SO ALL THE BOARDS GET EXAMINED

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:39.814
OCE EVERY FIVE YEARS. THEY

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.382
MUST PROVE THAT THERE IS

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:43.084
PRESENT SIGNIFICANT

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.720
SUBSTANTIATED HARM AND THEY'RE

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:48.923
ALSO REQUIRED TO CONSIDERED THE

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:50.024
LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS OF

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:55.830
REGULATIONS. FIRST BEFORE THEY

01:28:55.897 --> 01:29:01.436
MOVE ON TO FULL LICENSURE. AND

01:29:01.502 --> 01:29:03.204
IT'S INTERESTING THE OHIO BILL

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:06.474
ACTUALLY. NOTE THAT THE BOARDS

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:07.742
WILL EXPIRE EVERY SIX YEARS

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:08.876
UNLESS THEY'RE EXPLICITLY

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.745
RENEWED BY LAWMAKERS SO IT'S

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:13.247
REQUIRING LEGISLATORS TO TAKE

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:14.882
THAT ACTIVE STEP TO RENEW THE

01:29:14.949 --> 01:29:17.251
BOARD AND IF THEY DON'T IT WILL

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:22.223
AUTOMATICALLY EXPIRE. FIVE SO

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:23.291
THAT IS THE THIRD AND I WANT TO

01:29:23.357 --> 01:29:24.826
TALK ABOUT THE MOVE TO THE NEXT

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.861
SLIDE THE FORCE CHANGING

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:29.130
REGULATORY STRUCTURE. SO WHAT

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:33.000
AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE. EACH

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:34.068
STAGE STRUCTURES THEIR

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:35.269
LICENSING BOARDS VERY

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:37.705
DIFFERENTLY SOME STATES. LIKE

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.273
CALIFORNIA HAVE A CENTRALIZED

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:40.775
SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S AND IN

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.910
UMBRELLA AGENCY THAT HOUSES ALL

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:43.778
OF THEIR BOARDS AND

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:45.980
COMMISSIONS. OTHER STATES THE

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.915
BOARDS ARE COMPLETELY

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:49.851
INDEPENDENT AND THEY HAVE THEIR

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.786
OWN RULE MAKING AUTHORITY THEY

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:54.055
HAVE THEIR OWN FEE STRUCTURES

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:56.357
SEPARATE FROM OTHER LICENSING

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.492
BOARDS THEIR THEIR

01:29:57.558 --> 01:30:00.561
INDEPENDENCE. AN AUTONOMOUS.

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:02.797
AND SO WE'VE SEEN A IN THE WAKE

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:06.367
OF NORTH CAROLINA DENTAL CASE

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.035
THAT WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT.

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:09.971
THAT ESTABLISHED THAT LICENSING

01:30:10.037 --> 01:30:13.174
BOARDS MUST HAVE ACTIVE STATE

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.843
SUPERVISION FROM A NEUTRAL

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:18.079
STATE ENTITY ARE WE SEEING A

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:21.182
LOT OF STATE TO MOVE AWAY FROM

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.217
THIS AUTONOMOUS STRUCTURE IN A

01:30:23.284 --> 01:30:25.253
INTO A CENTRALIZED STRUCTURE SO

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:29.590
WE SEEN. IT IT IT ALL STEMS

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:33.361
FROM THIS THIS NEED TO

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:34.162
ESTABLISH ACTED STAYS

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:36.898
SUPERVISION SO LICENSING BOARDS

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:40.401
ARE AFRAID THAT IF THEY REMAIN

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.904
AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT.

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:44.872
THAT AN ACTION THAT THEY TAKE

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.908
AGAINST THE LICENSEE MIGHT BE

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:49.977
CONSIDERED A VIOLATION OF THE

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.513
ANTI TRUST LAW AND THEY COULD

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:57.251
BE PERSONALLY HELD LIABLE. THAT

01:30:57.318 --> 01:31:00.254
THAT BIG RULING FROM THAT NORTH

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:03.157
CAROLINA CASES WELL IS THAT THE

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:05.092
BOARD THE BOARD MEMBERS AND OF

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:06.994
CAN INDIVIDUALLY HE HELD

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:09.730
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTIONS TAKEN

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:12.033
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD AND- WE

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:14.168
SEE A LOT OF STATE. TRYING TO

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:15.837
PROTECT THEMSELVES BY

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:24.645
ESTABLISHING THIS ACTIVE STATE.

01:31:24.712 --> 01:31:35.323
SUPERVISION A WITH WOULD BE.

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:36.757
ALSO INTERESTED IN CENTRALIZING

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:39.694
JUST FOR IT MINISTRY TO

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.330
PURPOSES SO GROUP BEING

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:44.765
AGENCIES TOGETHER AND BROAD

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:48.236
FUNCTIONAL AREAS CREATING A

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:51.038
CONNIE'S OF SCALE AND

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:53.808
ESTABLISHING JUST A FEW

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.343
DEPARTMENTS RATHER THAN ALL OF

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:59.180
THESE INDEPENDENT BOARDS WHO

01:31:59.247 --> 01:31:59.747
ARE KIND OF YOU KNOW OUT ON

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:03.951
THEIR OWN. SO IF WE MOVE TO THE

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:04.785
NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE THIS

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:05.519
COMES FROM THE COUNCIL OF

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:07.755
LICENSURE ENFORCEMENT AND

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:10.358
REGULATION CLEAR IT CREATED

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:12.426
THIS MODEL STRUCTURE OF HOW

01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:14.295
STATE BOARDS ARE SET UP SO WE

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.330
CAN SEE MODEL A AT THE TOP.

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:18.633
COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUS AND IN

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:20.401
MODEL HE AT THE VERY BOTTOM

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:21.702
WHERE THERE'S A CENTRAL AGENCY

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:25.072
THAT HAS COMPLETE AUTHORITY AND

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:27.508
BOARDS ARE ARE YOU ADVISORY

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:28.676
ONLY SO STATES ARE FALLING

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:31.913
SOMEWHERE IT'S NOT AS RIGID AS

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:33.714
THEIR INDEPENDENCE OR DEPENDENT

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:34.849
BUT THERE'S KIND OF THIS

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:37.818
SPECTRUM. THAT THAT BOARDS ARE

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:41.422
FALLING UNDER. IN THEIR THEIR

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:46.560
REGULATORY STRUCTURE. UNTIL WE

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:47.762
MOVED TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:49.697
SEE SOME SPECIFIC. REFORMS THAT

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:51.699
STATES HAVE DONE THE PAST YEARS

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:53.601
SO COMBINING SIMILAR

01:32:53.668 --> 01:32:55.136
OCCUPATIONS UNDER AN UMBRELLA

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:56.137
BOARD SO THAT WOULD BE LIKE FOR

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.405
EXAMPLE TAKING THE COSMETOLOGY

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.740
BOARD. IN THE BARBERING BOARD

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:01.175
AT THOSE RISKS SEPARATING

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:02.944
CREATING ONE SINGLE UMBRELLA

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:06.781
BOARD SO PURSUING THAT IDEAL

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:10.451
CENTRALIZATION THERE. KENTUCKY

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:12.620
IT IS IN THERE ATTEMPTING TO

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:13.587
CENTRALIZE ALL OF THEIR

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:15.957
LICENSING BOARD. UNDERNEATH ONE

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:19.593
CABINET. MISSISSIPPI IN

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.995
OKLAHOMA AND ESTABLISHED

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:23.397
COMMISSIONS THAT ARE ARE

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:26.667
REGULARLY REVIEWING BOARD SO

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:28.569
THAT THEY HAD THAT THAT ACTIVE

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:30.237
STATE SUPERVISION. THAT WE

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:35.676
TALKED ABOUT. FROM THE NORTH

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:41.983
CAROLINA DENTAL CASE. BUT THAT

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.050
IS THE FOURTH TREND IF WE MOVE

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:44.485
ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. FIFTH AND

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.654
FINAL TREND THAT I WANTED TO

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:47.288
TALK ABOUT THAT STATES ARE VERY

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:49.323
INTERESTED IN IS THE INTERSTATE

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:50.391
COMPACT SO THE ISSUE HERE IT

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:51.025
GOES BACK TO THE MOBILITY ISSUE

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:52.226
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:54.195
UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION HOW DO WE

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:56.297

STATE LINES MORE SEAMLESSLY

01:33:59.033 --> 01:34:02.837

THE FULL LICENSURE PROCESS OVER

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:06.941
AGAIN. SO WHAT IS AN INTERSTATE

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:08.542
COMPACT ESSENTIALLY IT IS AN

01:34:08.609 --> 01:34:10.878

01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:32.926
QUESTIONS A FEW OF WHICH I MASS

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:33.927
TODAY BUT YEARS CERTAINLY A

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:37.197
GREAT RESOURCE FOR A WHAT IS

01:40:37.264 --> 01:40:38.465
HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY IN

01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:41.568
THIS IN THIS AREA YOU KNOW I'M

01:40:41.635 --> 01:40:43.771
TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH THAT THE

01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:45.139
SLIDE THAT YOU SHOWED AT THE

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.440
END WHERE THESE INTERSTATE

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:50.144
COMPACTS SHOWS CALIFORNIA HAS

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:50.744
A- HAS REALLY HAD. NOT ENTERED

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:54.515
INTO ANY OF THEM. AND THE YOU

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.250
KNOW THE AD EVERYBODY WILL HAVE

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:56.717
A REASON FOR THAT BUT

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:57.785
CERTAINLY. AT THE HEART. OF THE

01:40:57.851 --> 01:40:59.953
OF THAT IS A CONCERN THAT THE

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:00.621
STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:03.223
APPLIED IN THOSE PLACES. FOR

01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:06.593
HEALTH AND SAFETY. ARE ADEQUATE

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:11.365
FOR US. AND THIS IS THAT THIS

01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:12.800
IS A CHALLENGE WE WE'VE SENT

01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:14.835
OUT A LITTLE BIT TIME OR

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:17.004
EARLIER IN THIS HEARING AND

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.604
ROUGH YOU COULD LISTEN AND HER

01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:19.673
COULD HEAR AND- TALKING ABOUT

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:20.574
THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS AROUND

01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:21.141
THE COUNTRY FOR TRAINING AND

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:24.411
EDUCATION. DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:26.780
BROAD OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THAT

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:27.781
ISSUE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AND

01:41:27.848 --> 01:41:30.250
THEN HOUSE OF MANY STATES ARE

01:41:30.317 --> 01:41:30.818
INTERPRETING THIS IMPORTANT

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:34.822
QUESTION SO DIFFERENTLY. SURE

01:41:34.888 --> 01:41:36.023
SO I THINK I GOT THE GIST OF

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:39.693
YOUR QUESTION SO IF YOU NOTICE

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.195
ON. ON THE SLIDE THAT THAT

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:45.466
SHOWS WHICH PROFESSIONS HAVE

01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:45.933
HAVE ESTABLISHED THESE

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:49.570
INTERSTATE COMPACTS. ALL OF

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:50.137
THEM ARE IN AND HEALTHCARE

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:51.772
PROFESSIONS AND THERE'S A

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:54.675
REASON FOR THAT AND CONTACTS

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:59.379
REALLY THRIVE ON UNIFORMITY SO

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:01.782
UNIFORMITY OF REQUIREMENTS

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:07.488
MAINLY. SO LET IT FROM OUR.

01:42:07.554 --> 01:42:08.255
WHEN WE DEVELOP THESE CONTACTS

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:11.191
WE ESTABLISH A UNIVERSAL

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:13.594
STANDARD FOR PRACTICE SO YOU'RE

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:15.429
NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:17.464
ACCEPTING ARIZONA STANDARDS BUT

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:20.033
THE COMPACT ITSELF IS CREATING

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:22.469
A NEW STANDARD THAT STATES ARE

01:42:22.536 --> 01:42:24.004
GOING TO HAVE TO HEAR TO IN

01:42:24.071 --> 01:42:25.506
SOME OF THE STATES WILL HAVE TO

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:26.740
RAISE THE BAR TO ENTER INTO THE

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.909
COMPACT. IN THE STATE'S MIGHT

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:30.244
HAVE TO LOWER THEIR BAR TO

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:32.546
ENTER INTO THE CONTACT BUT

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:33.647
HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS WE'VE

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:36.450
SEEN ARE FAIRLY UNIFORM ACROSS

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:38.485
THE COUNTRY AND THEIR LICENSING

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:40.387
REQUIREMENTS OF WHAT IT TAKES

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:42.756
TO BE A NURSE IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:44.424
TYPICALLY WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:48.896
NURSE IN IN MOST OTHER STATES

01:42:48.962 --> 01:42:49.463
SO THAT YOU KNOW BACHELOR'S

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:52.366
DEGREE PASSING THE AND COLLECT.

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:56.570
AND IN HAVING SOME SORT OF

01:42:56.637 --> 01:43:01.708
FELLOWSHIP OR ASSISTANTSHIP SO

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:04.244
IN THE SAME FOR THE MEDICAL

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:05.479
LICENSE OR COMPACT IN PHYSICAL

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:07.047
THERAPY THESE ARE ALL

01:43:07.114 --> 01:43:09.616
PROFESSIONS WHERE STANDARD TO

01:43:09.683 --> 01:43:11.718
PRACTICE IS PRETTY UNIFORM

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:12.986
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE

01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:16.523
DIFFERENCES ARE. ARE MORE

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:26.366
MENIAL I WILL NOTE SO I HAVE.

01:43:26.433 --> 01:43:35.142
TEACHERS UNDER. CONTACTS AND

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:36.977
DEVELOPMENT STAGE THAT'S ONE

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:38.011
PROFESSION IS THAT THAT IS

01:43:38.078 --> 01:43:38.946
CERTAINLY AN OUT LIAR ON THIS

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:41.682
LIST THE ALL THE OTHER

01:43:41.748 --> 01:43:42.249
PROFESSIONS ARE ARE HEALTH

01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:45.619
CARE. BUT TEACHERS THAT THAT'LL

01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:48.355
BE. A DIFFICULT CONTACT TO

01:43:48.422 --> 01:43:49.823
ESTABLISH BECAUSE THE STANDARDS

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:50.591
ARE ARE SO VASTLY DIFFERENT

01:43:50.657 --> 01:43:52.359
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND BECAUSE

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:53.760
SO MANY THERE'S SO MANY

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:54.361
DIFFERENT TRACKS TO BECOMING A

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:56.263
TEACHER I TO BE VERY HARD TO

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:57.731
ESTABLISH ONE SINGLE STANDARD.

01:43:57.798 --> 01:44:00.033
THAT STATES WILL IT HERE TOO

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:00.534
WHEN THEY ENTER INTO THE

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.436
COMPACT SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD

01:44:02.502 --> 01:44:03.170
RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION IS

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:04.371
THAT COMPAQ'S REALLY THRIVE ON

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:05.238
UNIFORMITY AND THAT'S WHY.

01:44:05.305 --> 01:44:06.373
THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.441
HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS THAT

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:08.342
HAVE PURSUED THESE IS BECAUSE-

01:44:08.408 --> 01:44:13.814
THEY HAVE RELATIVE UNIFORMITY.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:14.247
AND THEIR LICENSING

01:44:14.314 --> 01:44:19.886
REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:20.854
AND SO MATT IS IT NAIVE OF ME

01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:21.555
TO RAISE THE QUESTION ABOUT

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:22.823
WHETHER THE COMPLEXITY THAT

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:24.758
GOES INTO BEING A NURSE. IS

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:25.859
HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:28.028
COMPLEXITY THAT GOES INTO BEING

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:28.629
ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE'S

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:34.167
NAILS. SORRY I MISSED THE LAST

01:44:34.234 --> 01:44:35.769
PART OF THAT QUESTION LINE AYE

01:44:35.836 --> 01:44:36.603
AYE AYE YEAH I'M TRYING TO

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:37.070
UNDERSTAND WITHIN THE

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:40.040
COSMETOLOGY. AND BARBERING

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:43.043
AREAS THAT WHY WE'RE FAILING TO

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:43.777
COME UP WITH A REASONABLE

01:44:43.844 --> 01:44:47.314
STANDARDS IS IT. AND I GUESS IT

01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:48.882
WAS A- A YOU KNOW SOMEONE

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:50.050
SUGGEST THAT BEING A NURSE IS

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:54.221
SOMEWHAT MORE COMPLEX. IN

01:44:54.287 --> 01:44:57.357
TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND

01:44:57.424 --> 01:45:00.827
SAFETY THAN THAN ONE MIGHT.

01:45:00.894 --> 01:45:01.294
NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF

01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:04.865
SOMEONE'S NAILS. YOUR HAIR ANY

01:45:04.931 --> 01:45:09.102
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THAT. SURE

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:11.738
SO YEAH I MEAN SO FOR NURSING I

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:14.541
MEAN IT'S- THE STANDARD ACROSS

01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:17.110
THE COUNTRY IS REALLY FOUR YEAR

01:45:17.177 --> 01:45:20.113
BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND PASSING

01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.448
THE AND COLLECTS THE NURSING

01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:24.551
EXAM SO THAT I THINK THAT'S A

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:27.521
PRETTY YOU KNOW A FOUR YEAR

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:31.558
DEGREE WHAT IS. I WOULD SAY THE

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:33.727
HIGHER BAR THAN JUST A AS A SET

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:36.663
NUMBER OF TRAINING HOURS IN IN

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:41.101
BEAUTY SCHOOL. I DON'T BELIEVE

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:43.003
FOR BARBERING IN COSMETOLOGY

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:45.072
THERE'S ANY KIND OF EDUCATION

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:47.641
REQUIREMENTS OTHER THAN THE

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:50.110
ACTUAL NUMBER OF HOURS IN

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:52.446
BEAUTY SCHOOL THAT YOU'RE

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:58.852
YOU'RE REQUIRED YOU. TO LOG SO

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:00.754
A IN THAT I WILL SAY WHEN WE'RE

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:01.388
TALKING ABOUT PROFESSIONS THAT

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:03.457
HAVE UNIFORMITY. THIS IS

01:46:03.523 --> 01:46:04.925
CERTAINLY THE BEAUTY

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:06.693
PROFESSIONS IN COSMETOLOGY IS

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:09.563
CERTAINLY A INDUSTRY THAT DOES

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:12.399
NOT HAVE UNIFORMITY THE GATE

01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:14.034
AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE

01:46:14.101 --> 01:46:16.336
DATABASE THAT I CITED THAT HAS

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:17.370
ALL HE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS

01:46:17.437 --> 01:46:19.506
ACROSS CITY STATE. THE VARIANCE

01:46:19.573 --> 01:46:22.342
BETWEEN THE LOW END OF THE

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:24.678
NUMBER OF HOURS IN THE HIGH END

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:26.079
IS EXTREMELY HIGH I KNOW SOME

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:28.849
STATES REQUIRE TWO THOUSAND

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:30.117
HOURS AND THEN THERE'S OTHER

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:32.686
STATES THAT. REQUIRE LESS THAN

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:35.756
A THOUSAND SO THERE REALLY IS

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:37.991
NOT I DON'T THINK STATES HAVE

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:39.426
COME TO ANY KIND OF A CONSENSUS

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:42.262
WHEN IT COMES TO. APPROPRIATE

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:44.865
LEVEL OF ENTRY LEVEL

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.767
REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE BEAUTY

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:47.968
PROFESSIONS AND MATT DO YOU

01:46:48.034 --> 01:46:50.470
HAVE A VIEW OF AS WHY THAT IS

01:46:50.537 --> 01:46:53.473
SO WHAT WHAT WHY WHY ARE WE

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:55.642
HAVING SUCH STRUGGLES THERE TO

01:46:55.709 --> 01:47:00.781
FIND UNIFORMITY. AND REASONABLE

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:08.955
STANDARDS. SURE I THINK THAT

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:12.459
ONE MAJOR FACTOR IS. THAT THE

01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:15.462
BEAUTY THE STATE BOARD AND THE

01:47:15.529 --> 01:47:17.497
THAT BEAUTY SCHOOLS HAVE AN

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:18.398
INCENTIVE THAT TO KEEP THE

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:20.867
HOURS HIGHER SO THE LONGER.

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:21.501
YOU'RE IN SCHOOL THE MORE MONEY

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:22.903
THAT THAT BEAUTY SCHOOL MAKE

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:24.304
THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO KEEP

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:25.172
THE HOURS AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE.

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:27.874
AND I THINK REGULATORS AND

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:33.914
POLICY MAKERS ARE KIND OF. YOU

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:34.514
KNOW COMING TO THEIR SENSES A

01:47:34.581 --> 01:47:35.549
DATING THING DO YOU KNOW DO WE

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:38.351
REALLY NEED TO BE REQUIRING TWO

01:47:38.418 --> 01:47:39.553
THOUSAND HOURS OR BOARD THIS

01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:40.620
PROFESSION WHEN MAY BE YOU KNOW

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:42.189
A MORE REASONABLE AND NOW WOULD

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:42.789
BE TWELVE HUNDRED OR SOMETHING

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:44.257
THAT SOMEWHERE MORE IN THE

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:46.660
MIDDLE. BUT THE BEAUTY SCHOOLS

01:47:46.726 --> 01:47:49.596
THAT ARE YOU KNOW PROFITING OFF

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:51.765
OF THESE APPLICANTS. HAVE

01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:53.333
INCENTIVE TO KEEP THE NUMBER AS

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.068
HIGH AS POSSIBLE SO I THINK

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:58.872
THAT'S A BIG REASON IS. THE

01:47:58.939 --> 01:48:03.877
BEAUTY SCHOOLS WANT. TO KEEP

01:48:03.944 --> 01:48:04.444
PEOPLE IN SCHOOL AS LONG AS

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:10.083
POSSIBLE. AND ARE THERE ANY

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:11.251
PLACES THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:13.286
LOOK TO HAVE A MORE OBJECTIVE

01:48:13.353 --> 01:48:13.920
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WHAT REALLY

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:14.654
IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:15.222
HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:20.627
THAT WE ALL WANT. I WOULD I

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:23.730
WOULD JUST POINT YOU TO THE-

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:25.465
THAT DATABASE OF REQUIREMENTS

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:27.834
THAT I MENTIONED I THINK YOU

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:29.002
KNOW IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE

01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:32.272
NUMBER OF HOURS. THAT OTHER

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:38.545
STATES HAVE DONE AND MAYBE.

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:39.212
THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

01:48:39.279 --> 01:48:42.148
RATIONALE FOR WHY WOULD YOU

01:48:42.215 --> 01:48:43.550
KNOW STAY ONLY OFF ONLY A

01:48:43.617 --> 01:48:44.484
REQUIRE THOUSAND AND MAYBE

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:47.220
THINK ABOUT MOVING MORE TOWARDS

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:50.857

ADDING ON MORE HOURS I ONLY SEE

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:13.880
STATE REMOVING THE NUMBER OF

01:49:13.947 --> 01:49:14.981
HOURS THAT THEY REQUIRE SETTING

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:16.283
NATIONALLY THERE'S IS KIND OF A

01:49:16.349 --> 01:49:22.989
TREND. TO KIND OF LOOSENED THE

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:24.124
REQUIREMENTS A LITTLE BIT AND

01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:26.860
THIS THIS AREA. BUT YEAH I

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:28.361
WOULD JUST I WOULD LOOK AT THAT

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:30.330
THE DATABASE AND LOOK AT THE

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:31.932
REQUIREMENTS ACROSS STATES AND

01:49:31.998 --> 01:49:33.466

MIDDLE GROUND BUT MY CHALLENGE

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.629
ON THE HOURS ISSUE. IS THAT IT

01:50:02.696 --> 01:50:03.396

01:50:03.463 --> 01:50:05.598
LIKE TO FOCUS ON. THE MERITS

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:06.833

COMPLEXITY THE HEALTH AND

01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:09.703
SAFETY STANDARDS THAT WE THINK

01:50:09.769 --> 01:50:11.571
ARE REASONABLE. RATHER THAN

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:12.939
THIS ARBITRARY NATURE OF OURS I

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:14.174
MEAN I KNOW I TALK ABOUT IT A

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.910

AT IN RELATION TO OTHER.

01:50:26.252 --> 01:50:28.221
PRACTICES AND THEIR EDUCATION

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:29.656
TRAINING BUT- AT THE END OF THE

01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:31.858
DAY. IT SHOULD JUST BE ABOUT AN

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:33.093
ARBITRARY NUMBER IT REALLY

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:34.160
SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT ARE WHAT

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:35.562

01:50:57.884 --> 01:51:01.287
HELP THERE ARE WHAT. IS THIS. I

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:02.422
KNOW THE OUT OF. THAT WE THINK.

01:51:02.489 --> 01:51:05.458
ARE REASONABLE. AND THEN AND

01:51:05.525 --> 01:51:07.327
THEN TO GO FROM. BUT LET ME SEE

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:08.995
I CHAIR LOW ANY FOR FATHER

01:51:13.566 --> 01:51:14.034
TO CHECK ON SOME OF THOSE

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:14.467
COMMENTS OF SHARING

01:51:14.534 --> 01:51:15.568
OBSERVATIONS TO. WE LOOK AT THE

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:17.570
BUREAU OF LABOR AND THE REPORTS

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:19.005
THAT THE MEAN INCOME. OF FOR

01:51:19.072 --> 01:51:20.340
MANY THESE INDIVIDUALS IS

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:21.307
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND A

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:21.908
COMMENSURATE WITH THAT TYPE OF

01:51:21.975 --> 01:51:22.575
TRAINING. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:51:22.642 --> 01:51:25.378
SO I THINK IT'S OUR OUR

01:51:25.445 --> 01:51:26.179
OBLIGATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:51:26.246 --> 01:51:27.714
SEEING WHAT. BEARERS THEY MIGHT

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:28.314
BE TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL

01:51:28.381 --> 01:51:29.516
SETTING THEM UP FOR SUCCESS.

01:51:29.582 --> 01:51:34.888
PARTICULAR. GIVEN THE COST OF

FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE AND I

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:48.968
HOPE ITWAS STILL. BENEFICIAL

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:49.602
FOR THE COMMITTEE IT WAS THANKS

01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:52.639
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME UP

01:51:52.705 --> 01:51:53.907
BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:56.009
I JUST WANNA GIVE LESLIE IN

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.544
ADAM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECAUSE

01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:59.312
YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW MATT AND

01:51:59.379 --> 01:52:00.780
OUR ORIGINAL SCHEDULE BUT I

01:52:00.847 --> 01:52:01.981
WANT TO SEE IT TO GIVE YOU AN

01:52:02.048 --> 01:52:03.850
OPPORTUNITY TO REACT IN A THEIR

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:04.584
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WITH

01:52:04.651 --> 01:52:07.454
HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:09.889
AND- IN CLOSING ON THIS.

01:52:09.956 --> 01:52:18.231
MICROPHONE. DOES THE TWO THINGS

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:19.866
THAT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:21.067
WHEN HE'S HOT TALKED ABOUT THE

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:23.436
CONSISTENCY AND HEALTH CARE

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:25.505
PART OF THE DIFFERENCE AND

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.807
HEALTH CARE POPULATIONS IS THAT

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:28.942
WHEN YOU GRADUATE FROM A

01:52:29.008 --> 01:52:31.911
PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S IN NURSING

01:52:31.978 --> 01:52:33.379
OR MEDICINE OR ANYTHING IT'S

01:52:33.446 --> 01:52:34.581
ALWAYS AN ACCREDITED PROGRAM

01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:35.882
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:38.151
WE HAVE WITH BEEN CONSISTENT IN

01:52:38.218 --> 01:52:40.320
COSMETOLOGY IS THAT IS SO MANY

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:42.222
PROGRAMS THAT DON'T FALL INTO

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:44.557
THAT ACCREDITED STATURE SAYS A

01:52:44.624 --> 01:52:48.461
STATUTE SO WHEN YOU MIX THOSE

01:52:48.528 --> 01:52:49.262
TWO THINGS OF NON ACCREDITED

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:53.833
SCHOOLS AN ACCREDITED. SCHOOLS

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:54.400
IN THE FALL OFF THAT GRAPHIC

01:52:54.467 --> 01:52:59.739
THAT HE HAD. FIND OUT. WHAT

01:52:59.806 --> 01:53:00.640
TYPE OF EDUCATION GETTING BE MY

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:02.342
ONE COMMENT. Q. ADAM ANYTHING

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:04.377
YOU WANT TO SAY IN REGARD TO

01:53:04.444 --> 01:53:08.181
MATS TESTIMONY. MR SHAFER SAID

01:53:08.248 --> 01:53:09.349
A- A LOT OF STUFF THAT I AGREE

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:09.916
WITH IN THAT WE AGREE WITH

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:10.683
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TARTED THIS

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:12.519
PROJECT SO WE CAN IDENTIFY THE

01:53:12.585 --> 01:53:14.354
RISK CAN CHANGE A DIALOGUE.

01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:15.755
THAT IS OCCURRING BECAUSE IT

01:53:15.822 --> 01:53:16.389
SEEMS LIKE THE DIALOGUE IS VERY

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:19.792
KERN IS ABOUT HOURS. AND I

01:53:19.859 --> 01:53:21.327
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE ORIGINAL

01:53:21.394 --> 01:53:22.962
OUR REQUIREMENT IF EVER CAME UP

01:53:23.029 --> 01:53:24.797
THAT'S WHY. THIS TYPE OF

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:26.866
DOCUMENT YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING

01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:29.569
ON IDENTIFYING THE RISK. IS A

01:53:29.636 --> 01:53:31.771
GOOD FOUNDATIONAL POINT OF US.

01:53:31.838 --> 01:53:34.107
REESTABLISHING WHERE THOSE

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:34.674
HOURS CAME OUT IN THE FIRST

01:53:34.741 --> 01:53:38.144
PLACE. HE ALSO RAISED THAT I

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:39.812
MEAN FOR US WE'RE TRYING TO

01:53:39.879 --> 01:53:41.014
FIND OBJECTIVE INFORMATION SO

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:43.583
WE MAKE GOOD CHOICES. AND HE HE

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:45.118
RAISE THE QUESTION THAT THERE

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:47.820
IS A SELF PROTECTION INTEREST

01:53:47.887 --> 01:53:49.455
IN DETERMINING THE EDUCATION

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:52.125
REQUIREMENTS. THAT WAS PRETTY

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:54.527
PRETTY POINTS AS AN EIGHT AND

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:57.297
I'M NOT AGREEING OR DISAGREEING

01:53:57.363 --> 01:53:57.864
WITH IT EXCEPT THAT WHEN IT

01:53:57.931 --> 01:53:59.465

01:53:59.532 --> 01:54:01.401
TO ASSESS THIS AND CARP THE

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.803
PATHWAY GOING FORWARD. WE WANT

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:05.638
TO MAKE US MORE CHOICES AND WE

01:54:05.705 --> 01:54:07.373
WANT TO BRING IN EXPERTS AND

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.007
THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:54:08.074 --> 01:54:09.809
INVOLVED IN THIS FIELD FOR A

01:54:09.876 --> 01:54:11.044
LONG TIME THAT ARE VERY SOME

01:54:14.948 --> 01:54:17.584
THE- THE AT THAT THE MEDIA OF

01:54:17.650 --> 01:54:19.152
THE EDUCATION PROGRAM YOU KNOW

01:54:19.219 --> 01:54:20.987
I WANT TO HEAR FROM SMARTER

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:22.388

INFORMATION I CAN TRUST. AND

01:54:29.662 --> 01:54:30.897
THAT ISN'T BASED ON A SELF

01:54:30.964 --> 01:54:33.132
INTEREST. AND THAT'S PART OF

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:34.200
OUR CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD I

01:54:34.267 --> 01:54:35.368

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:07.627
LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM. MISS

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:09.562
RUSTY ACSI SERVED WITH ME IN A

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:11.531
NUMBER OF INDUSTRY FOLKS ON A

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:13.933
RECENT STATE BOARD CONVENE TASK

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.668
FORCE ON THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED

01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:18.004
OUR PROGRAM. AND BY CONSENSUS

01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:20.373
WE AGREED THAT THE SIXTEEN

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:21.140
HUNDRED HOURS OFFERED IN

01:56:21.207 --> 01:56:23.009
CALIFORNIA IS THE MIDDLE GROUND

01:56:23.076 --> 01:56:25.745
OF ALL FIFTY STATES WE WENT

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:26.346
THROUGH ALL OF THE CURRICULUM

01:56:26.412 --> 01:56:28.147
AND DECIDED IT WAS APPROPRIATE.

01:56:28.214 --> 01:56:31.451
HOWEVER MY ASSOCIATION WANTS TO

01:56:31.517 --> 01:56:32.819
EMBRACE COMPETENCY BASED

01:56:32.885 --> 01:56:35.888
EDUCATION. WE THINK WE SHOULD

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:36.522
THE STATE SHOULD OFFER IT AS AN

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:39.192
OPTION. DON'T THROW THE BABY

01:56:39.258 --> 01:56:40.426
OUT WITH THE BATHWATER OUR

01:56:40.493 --> 01:56:42.795
INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY HAD TO

01:56:42.862 --> 01:56:44.030
ABSORB A LOT OF MAJOR CHANGES

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:47.533
RECENTLY. BUT MAYBE REQUIRE

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.134
FOUR HUNDRED HOURS OF HEALTH

01:56:48.201 --> 01:56:48.835
AND SAFETY THEORETICAL

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:50.737
INSTRUCTION AND THEN ALLOW

01:56:50.803 --> 01:56:52.939
SCHOOLS TO CERTIFY THE

01:56:53.005 --> 01:56:55.441
TECHNIQUE COMPETENCIES. SO THAT

01:56:55.508 --> 01:56:57.343
YOU BASS HAVE A BASE AMOUNT OF

01:56:57.410 --> 01:56:58.945
HOURS AND THEN A CERTIFICATION

01:56:59.011 --> 01:57:01.347
PROCESS I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:04.183
WAYS WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT. WE

01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:05.952
ALSO PROPOSE DRAMATICALLY

01:57:06.018 --> 01:57:08.287
INCREASING EXTERNSHIP RIGHT NOW

01:57:08.354 --> 01:57:10.690
YOU HAVE TO GET 60% OF THOSE

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:11.624
SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS BEFORE

01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:12.859
YOU CAN QUALIFY TO WORK IN THE

01:57:12.925 --> 01:57:14.660
SALON AS AN EXTRA AS AN UNPAID

01:57:14.727 --> 01:57:18.264
EXTRA. WE WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:21.934
THOSE HOURS GET KIDS INTO SALON

01:57:22.001 --> 01:57:23.669
SOONER AND ALLOW THEM TO BE

01:57:23.736 --> 01:57:26.406
PAID. WERE ALLOWING THE PROCESS

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:29.275
TO BE PAID AFTER ONLY RECEIVING

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:29.709
THIRTY NINE HOURS OF

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:32.345
INSTRUCTION. AND THEN THEY GO

01:57:32.412 --> 01:57:33.646
THROUGH A TWO YEAR PROCESS OF

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.014
BEING EARNING WHILE THEY'RE

01:57:35.081 --> 01:57:38.017
LEARNING SO WE THINK EXTERNSHIP

01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:38.484
SHOULD BE DRAMATICALLY

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:41.821
INCREASED. IN TERMS OF

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:42.522
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS I

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:44.524
BELIEVE THERE'S ONLY SIX

01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:45.825
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:47.293

ENTIRE STATE BUDGET TWELVE NOW

01:57:49.429 --> 01:57:52.465
OKAY SO THERE'S ONLY TWELVE AND

01:57:52.532 --> 01:57:53.800
PART OF THAT REASON IS

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:55.435
COMMITTEE COLLEGES VALUE TO BUY

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.870
TWO TRANSFERS THEY'RE LOOKING

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:02.942
PRIORITY WE CERTAINLY WOULD.

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:04.043
EMBRACE MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:06.078

THEIR THEIR OWN FIVE TIMES.

01:58:12.518 --> 01:58:15.221
RECIPROCITY MOST OF THE

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:16.656
PRESENTATION AT THE END WAS

01:58:16.722 --> 01:58:19.892

LOT OF THAT PRESENTATION WAS

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:47.086
FAIRLY IGNORANT OF WHAT

POPULATION SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:44.697
NEW YORK FLORIDA TEXAS ILLINOIS

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:46.666
OHIO SO I INTERACT WITH THESE

02:01:46.732 --> 02:01:48.200
PEOPLE ON A REGULAR BASIS AND

02:01:48.267 --> 02:01:49.935
LESLIE INTERACTS IN A DIFFERENT

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:52.004
WAY BECAUSE SHE'S TRAVELING ALL

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:53.305
OVER THE COUNTRY AND DEALING

02:01:53.372 --> 02:01:54.874
DIRECTLY WITH THE LEGISLATORS.

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.876
AND THE REGULATORS I'M DEALING

02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:57.677

IN THE SALON OWNERS ALL OVER.

02:02:02.114 --> 02:02:05.384
AND I WILL SAY THAT. NOTHING TO

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:08.120
THIS POINT THAT ANY STATE. HAS

02:02:08.187 --> 02:02:08.721
LEGISLATIVE WORTH CONSIDERING

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:11.557
LEGISLATING IS NEARLY AS

02:02:11.624 --> 02:02:13.826
IMPORTANT OR IMPACTFUL AS WHAT

02:02:13.893 --> 02:02:17.596
CALIFORNIA COULD AND SHOULD DO

02:02:17.663 --> 02:02:20.966
THAT IS THE LEVEL OF INFLUENCE

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:21.534
AND POWER THAT YOU HAVE OVER

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:24.270
THIS INDUSTRY. AND I JUST WANT

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:25.504
TO ADD A FEW THINGS HERE BUT

02:02:25.571 --> 02:02:27.740
REFER TO MY NOTES AND I'M OLD

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:30.843
DEL SECTOR CLASSES. BUT I WANT

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:33.212
TO SAY. THAT SPEAKING FOR

02:02:33.279 --> 02:02:34.780
MYSELF BOTH PERSONALLY ND

02:02:34.847 --> 02:02:37.116
PROFESSIONALLY. I'D RATHER BE

02:02:37.183 --> 02:02:39.685
ALONE THAN IN BAD COMPANY. AND

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:42.188
I THINK THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE

02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:42.788
DEFINITELY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE

02:02:42.855 --> 02:02:45.324
OUR LEADERSHIP. AND WE HAVE

02:02:45.391 --> 02:02:48.327
THAT POWER TO DO THAT. AS A

02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:49.628
MANICURIST I KNOW A LOT OF

02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:50.229
THESE CONVERSATIONS COME BACK

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:53.799
TO MALES. AND I AM READY AND

02:02:53.866 --> 02:02:55.768
PREPARED FOR THE SCRUTINY THAT

02:02:55.835 --> 02:02:58.571
I FEEL THAT WE DESERVE FROM THE

02:02:58.637 --> 02:03:00.139
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IF WE

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:03.876
CANNOT. JUSTIFY HOW WE DO

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:05.978
THINGS. AND WHY WE DO THE

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:07.046
THINGS THAT WE DO. THEN WE

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:08.814
SHOULD BE CHALLENGED.

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:10.382
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO COULD

02:03:10.449 --> 02:03:12.218
DEFINITELY USE IMPROVEMENT BUT

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:14.553
I WILL SAY TO THIS POINT THAT.

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:16.222
CHRISTY UNDERWOOD AND HER STAFF

02:03:16.288 --> 02:03:18.958
HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY OVER THE

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:19.558
YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:20.793
IN THE BOARD WHICH IS BEEN OVER

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:22.495
TWELVE. TO MEET LEGISLATIVE

02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:25.798
MANDATES. OVER THE YEARS AND

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:26.432
PERHAPS THE LEGISLATURE WAS AND

02:03:26.499 --> 02:03:27.500
ALWAYS ASKING FOR THE RIGHT

02:03:27.566 --> 02:03:30.169
THINGS. AND O HERE WE ARE. SO

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:31.670
GOING FORWARD LET ME JUST POINT

02:03:31.737 --> 02:03:33.572
OUT THAT. WE CAN ATTACK THIS

02:03:33.639 --> 02:03:34.707
LOTS OF DIFFERENT ANGLES AS A

02:03:34.774 --> 02:03:37.443
CONSUMER WE TELL CONSUMERS. TO

02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:41.747
DO THEIR RESEARCH. BY LICENSURE

02:03:41.814 --> 02:03:42.348
THE BREEZE SYSTEM BUT WHAT'S

02:03:42.414 --> 02:03:44.216
THE POINT THE TECHNOLOGY WHEN

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:45.184
ESTABLISHMENT OWNERS AND

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:47.787

02:03:47.853 --> 02:03:50.222
AND ADVERTISE WITH FAKE NAMES

02:03:50.289 --> 02:03:52.224
THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT YOU

02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:53.526
IS A LICENSEE ACTUALLY USE YOUR

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:56.529
NAME AND YOUR ADVERTISEMENT SO

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:57.429
I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE

02:03:57.496 --> 02:03:59.231
WORTHWHILE TO REQUIRE US IS

02:03:59.298 --> 02:04:01.200
LICENSEES ESTABLISHMENT OWNERS

02:04:01.267 --> 02:04:02.234
TO ADVERTISE WITH OUR LICENSE

02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:03.936
NUMBERS SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN

02:04:04.003 --> 02:04:05.971
DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE AND LOOK

02:04:06.038 --> 02:04:09.275

02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:09.809

WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR LICENSING

02:04:12.912 --> 02:04:13.479
CATEGORIES THIS GOES ALONG WITH

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:14.013
THE COMP ASIAN ABOUT OUR

02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:15.381
REQUIREMENTS WE SHOULD HAVE A

02:04:15.447 --> 02:04:17.116

INTO THE INDUSTRY FASTER THAT

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:24.156
WILL REDUCE THE BARRIER TO

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:26.692
ENTRY. AND THEN LASTLY AS WERE

AT THE END OF THE DAY. I HAVE

02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:53.305
TO KIND OF REMEMBER THAT WHEN

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:06:54.239 --> 02:06:55.908
CURRICULUM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:06:55.975 --> 02:06:57.142
TEACHING STUDENTS A CHANGE IN

02:06:57.209 --> 02:06:58.877
BEHAVIOR WHICH CAUSES THE

02:06:58.944 --> 02:07:01.380
COGNITIVE DOMAIN. AS CYCLE

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:03.115
MOTOR SKILLS SAID DOMAIN AND

02:07:03.182 --> 02:07:05.517
EFFECTIVE DOMAIN WHICH CAUSES A

02:07:05.584 --> 02:07:06.885
CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR NOT SIMPLY

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:09.521
REMEMBERING FACTS BUT WE WANT

02:07:09.588 --> 02:07:10.155
THEM TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR SO THAT

02:07:10.222 --> 02:07:12.458
WHEN THEY GET EMPLOYED. THAT

02:07:12.524 --> 02:07:15.060
THEY CAN CONTINUE ON. WORKING

02:07:15.127 --> 02:07:17.129
IN RISK FREE AND INDUSTRY SO

02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:18.263
THEY DON'T HAVE THESE PROBLEMS

02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:19.064
LATER DOWN HE ROAD WAS SITE

02:07:19.131 --> 02:07:21.066
AND FIND IN ISSUES. SO THERE'S

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:22.601
THE DESIRE THERE'S THE AND PUT

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:23.969
THERE'S THE ASSIMILATION AND

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:25.070
THE OTHER PART IS THE

02:07:25.137 --> 02:07:27.639
REPETITION THAT STUDENTS NEED

02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:28.240
TO DO. TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:30.876
INDUSTRY. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

02:07:30.943 --> 02:07:33.312
AT THE HOURS SCOPE OR THE HOURS

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:34.279
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:07:34.346 --> 02:07:36.015
ACTUALLY OUR PROGRAM IN OUR C.

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:39.218
C. IS ACTUALLY. SIXTEEN HUNDRED

02:07:39.284 --> 02:07:39.885
FIFTY HOURS WE HAVE STUDENTS TO

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:41.153
STICK AROUND FOR TWO THOUSAND

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.822
HOURS. BECAUSE THEY WANT THAT

02:07:43.889 --> 02:07:44.323
SECURITY BEFORE THEY GET

02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:47.526
LICENSE. WE JUST HAD A REMEDIAL

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:49.028
CLASS HAD FORTY STUDENTS ATTEND

02:07:49.094 --> 02:07:50.796
REMEDIAL NOT BECAUSE THEY

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:52.731
NEEDED TO ARE REQUIRED TO BUT

02:07:52.798 --> 02:07:53.599
THEY WANT TO COME TO. THE

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:55.634
COLLEGE AND GET FURTHER

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:58.871
TREATMENT. FURTHER EDUCATION SO

02:07:58.937 --> 02:08:00.706
WE CALL REMEDIAL COURSE AND THE

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:02.508
BIGGEST THING THAT I SEE IN THE

02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:04.877
REMEDIAL COURSES IS THAT.

02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:06.178
PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THE

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:08.881
INDUSTRY WITH NOT A CHANGE IN

02:08:08.947 --> 02:08:10.416
BEHAVIOR THEY COME WITH FACTS

02:08:10.482 --> 02:08:12.584
TO PASS THE TEST. AND COGNITIVE

02:08:12.651 --> 02:08:13.919
SKILLS SETS TO OUR CYCLE MORE

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:15.721
SCHOOL SAYS TO PASS THE TEST

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:16.488
AND THEN FROM THERE ON THE

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:18.190
DON'T LEARN. WE NEED A CHANGE

02:08:18.257 --> 02:08:19.558
IN BEHAVIOR FOR THE STUDENTS

02:08:19.625 --> 02:08:20.793
AND THOSE ARE DETERMINED BY THE

02:08:20.859 --> 02:08:22.628
STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES SO

02:08:22.694 --> 02:08:25.664
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE OUR

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:26.165

THEN THE REPETITION WHICH IS

02:08:31.403 --> 02:08:33.272
THE EFFECTIVE DOMAIN TO GIVE

02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:33.839

02:09:50.249 --> 02:09:53.385
BETWEEN THE VALUE OF THE

02:09:53.452 --> 02:09:53.986
PRIVATIZED SCHOOLS VERSUS THE

02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:56.321
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE PUBLIC

02:09:56.388 --> 02:09:57.456
SCHOOL EDUCATION THAT THEY ARE

02:09:57.523 --> 02:10:02.961
RECEIVING IS. MORE ON TARGET

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:04.396
WITH STAYING WITHIN SCOPE OF

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:06.999
PRACTICE THEY TEND TO BE A

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:09.067
LITTLE BIT MORE RELIABLE WITH

02:10:09.134 --> 02:10:12.371
STAYING IN SCOPE FOR NOT

02:10:12.437 --> 02:10:14.273
VENTURING OUT INTO THE THINGS

02:10:14.339 --> 02:10:15.474
THAT THE PRIVATE MANUFACTURERS

02:10:15.541 --> 02:10:16.742
ARE BRINGING TO THE PRIVATE

02:10:16.808 --> 02:10:18.343
SCHOOLS THAT ARE COMING IN ON

02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:20.746
REGULATED SO PROCESSES LIKE

02:10:20.812 --> 02:10:21.980
MICRO BLADING WHICH ARE NOT

02:10:22.047 --> 02:10:22.981
PART OF OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:25.217
IN CALIFORNIA ARE BEING BROUGHT

02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:26.752
INTO THE PRIVATIZED SCHOOLS ALL

02:10:26.818 --> 02:10:28.587
THE TIME. SO THOSE STUDENTS ARE

02:10:28.654 --> 02:10:30.222
LEARNING THESE PROCESSES THAT

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:31.256
ARE WAY OUT OF SCOPE OF

02:10:31.323 --> 02:10:33.725
PRACTICE IN THESE PRIVATE

02:10:33.792 --> 02:10:37.663
SCHOOLS WITH WITH NO NO I HAVE

02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:38.830
REPERCUSSIONS SO THEY GO OUT

02:10:38.897 --> 02:10:41.466
INTO THE INDUSTRY ON THEIR OWN

02:10:41.533 --> 02:10:43.035
USUALLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:10:43.101 --> 02:10:45.137
AN EMPLOYMENT SITUATION TO GO

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:47.773
TO THEY JUST OPEN UP SHOP START

02:10:47.839 --> 02:10:48.373
A BUSINESS LICENSE AND THEY'RE

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:51.243
ON THEIR OWN. SO WHEN WE TALK

02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:53.478
ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE THEY'RE

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:54.513
NOT REALLY BEING SUPERVISED

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.882
VERY HONESTLY THEY ARE COMING

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:58.350
OUT AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

02:10:58.417 --> 02:10:59.952
WORK IN AN ACTUAL SALON

02:11:00.018 --> 02:11:02.221
ENVIRONMENT AS AN EMPLOYEE.

THEY'RE ALL FREELANCERS DOING

02:11:03.755 --> 02:11:05.724
THEIR OWN THING. SO THESE ARE

02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:06.758
SOME THINGS THAT ARE VERY

02:11:06.825 --> 02:11:08.627

WITHOUT OF THE BOARD OF

CURRENTLY AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE

02:12:47.292 --> 02:12:48.960
ONLY  CURRENTLY HAVE FIVE OF
