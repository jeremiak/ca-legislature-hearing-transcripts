THAT HE SLOWLY OVER TIME I

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:31.270
THINK- WE'VE HAD A COUPLE

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.805
SIGNIFICANT FIND. CHANGES OVER

THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.642
REALLY EXACERBATED THE

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:39.278
SHORTFALL AND SHORTEN THE TIME

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.713
LINE WHICH IS INCREASING. AND

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.615
THEN- DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:02.601
DOES NOT ACTUALLY DO TRANSFERS

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:04.169
THOSE ARE A PERSON TO STAY COOL

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.438
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND WE

COULDN'T GET A CLEAR ANSWER ON

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:18.210
IT. BUT A LONG SAME LINES AS-

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:21.246
BUT MY COLLEAGUE- IT SEEMS LIKE

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.214
YOU'VE GOT A LONG PERIOD OF

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.449
TIME WITHOUT A FEE INCREASE-

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:26.118
AND YOU MENTIONED YOURSELF THAT

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.719
WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER TO

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:31.089
HAVE STEADY. FEE INCREASES- I'M

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:33.058
TRYING TO FIND OUT. IS IT

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.760
POSSIBLE FOR THAT TO BE A

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:38.296
POLICY- WITH THESE TYPES OF

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:40.565
FEES IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MATCH-

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:42.801
ONGOING EXPENSES THAT ARE

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:43.969
INCREASING YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:46.338
MATCH- SALARIES BENEFITS

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:47.906
XCERRA. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:49.608
GOING TO BE INCREASING TO GO

00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:50.909
FIFTEEN YEARS EVEN THOUGH YOU

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.010
MIGHT SAY HEY WE HAD THIS

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:53.745
HEALTHY RESERVE OR WHATEVER.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:54.880
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA FALL OFF

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.049
A CLIFF AT SOME POINT TIME FAR

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:59.017
BETTER A LONG TERM POLICY TO DO

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:00.919
THAT. IS IT POSSIBLE DO YOU

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.622
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SORT TO.

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:06.324
REQUEST NEVER LEGISLATURE

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:08.660
APPROVED- EFIA INCREASED IT HAS

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.729
A BUILT IN INFLATION FACTOR IN

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:14.299
IT OF SOME SORT. SURE AND I AND

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:15.367
I THINK YOU ACTUALLY SEE THAT

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:16.568
IN SOME OF THE OTHER FUEL

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:18.603
EXCISE TAX- STATUTORY

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.038
REQUIREMENTS A LOT OF THOSE ARE

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:22.240
TIED TO CPI SO THOSE ACTUALLY

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:24.843
PLAYED OVER THE COURSE OF TIME.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.311
I DON'T THINK CITY I WOULD

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:28.980
HAVE- KEPT UP WITH THE RATE OF

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:30.115
OUR PROGRAM EXPENDITURE

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:31.416
INCREASES OVER THE COURSE OF

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.485
TIME I DID THAT ANALYSIS IT

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:34.119
LOOKS LIKE WE WOULD HAVE

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.721
INCREASED THE FEE ON AN ANNUAL

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:37.489
BASIS FROM ABOUT TEN TO.

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:38.223
FIFTEEN DOLLARS WHICH WOULD

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.558
HAVE CRIED QUITE MAD WHERE WERE

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:41.026
UP TO DATE WITH THIS YOU LEVEL

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:43.628
INCREASE BUT CERTAINLY SEE GUYS

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:45.263
IS SOMETHING YOU CAN LOOK TO I

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.466
TIRE SPECTRUM CREASES TO I

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:48.533
THINK THE L. L. IS ALSO

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.202
SUGGESTED A TRIGGER MECHANISM

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:52.704
THAT WOULD- AUTOMATE A FEE

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.906
INCREASE. DEPENDING ON SEVERAL

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:58.076
FACTORS- WE ACTUALLY REPORT

00:22:58.143 --> 00:22:59.678
PROPOSED A SHORT TERM SOLUTION

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:00.746
HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO GO BACK

00:23:00.812 --> 00:23:01.313
AND WORK WITH THE BOATING

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:03.448
COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS THAT THE

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:06.017
DPW COMMISSION AND TRY TO FIND

00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:11.389
A FEW STRUCTURE THAT WORKS- FOR

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:12.424
THOSE FOLKS- AND EXPORTS. OF

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.459
THE OTHER OPTION WE'VE TALKED.

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:15.160
YOUR VESSEL REGISTRY FEES

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.262
NORMALLY. THE BROADER A AYE S.

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:20.398
B. AB THEBODY MAY HAS AS

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:22.701
PROPOSED. EXPLAINED BENEFICIARY

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.269
PAID SMALL FOR QUITE RACES

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:25.537
SPECIES WHICH IS ONE OF THE

00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:26.972
LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO.

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:29.975
EXPECTORANT RACES ON THIS FUN-

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:30.776
AND I THINK THE OTHER FACTOR

00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:32.911
THAT WOULD BE SOMEONE RUNNING

00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:35.113
FOR US TO- THE TITLE

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.716
REGISTRATION FEES NOW. WITHOUT

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:39.651
A LONGER TERM SIX DISCUSSION IS

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:41.186
WHETHER WE CAN DO THIS THE

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:42.988
INCREASES WITH THE N. B. UNDER

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:44.689
THE CURRENT SYSTEM HOW HOSTAGE

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:46.258
THE SPEAKERS. SO HIS ARE ALL

00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:49.161
THINGS BETTER- FOR DISCUSSION I

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:50.862
THINK AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.164
THIS IS THIS PROPOSAL BUZZES

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.832
ABOUT THREE YEARS TO FUND

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:55.500
SUSTAINABILITY. DOES YOUR

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:57.669
DEPARTMENT SUPPORT GOING TO

00:23:57.736 --> 00:24:03.942
THAT KIND OF FEE. STRUCTURE IN

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:06.444
GENERAL. I DO IT. STRUCTURE OR

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:08.046
AND FOR. ADJUSTED FLEECED.

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:09.381
STRUCK MAY NOT BE A PLACE

00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:10.715
ADJUSTED EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:12.217
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A- YOU

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.119
KNOW A- DOLLAR FORTY TO

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:16.054
INCREASE BUT YOU. YOU YOU KNOW

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.389
MAYBE EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS YOU

00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:19.191
ADJUSTED AND ROUNDED OFF TO THE

00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:21.326
NEAREST FIVE DOLLARS OR OR

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:25.564
WHATEVER. D. GET GET YOUR- SAID

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.033
THINK CPI MAKES A LOT OF SENSE

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:30.468
TO OFFSET EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:30.969
AND THE COST OF GETTING

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:35.240
CREASES- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.908
RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:37.442
WORKING WITH THE BOATING

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:39.711
COMMUNITY ON A LONGER TERM

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:42.247
INCREASE SO I THINK- THOSE

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:43.882
DISCUSSIONS WILL REALLY INFORM

00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:47.185
WORKMAN'S STANCE ON THE CPI.

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:51.756
THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:58.997
QUESTIONS. WE HAVE A REPORT

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:00.799
FROM THE L. A. O. AND TO THE

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:03.702
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES GOOD

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:05.604
MORNING THIS IS RACHEL EHLERS

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.304
FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:09.274
OFFICE- AND WE THINK THERE ARE

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.442
A LOT OF POSITIVE FEATURES

00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:11.877
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:13.278
THAT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:14.913
IMMEDIATELY BEFORE YOU WITH A

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.581
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. IT'S

00:25:16.648 --> 00:25:18.316
BALANCED IN THAT IT LOOKS AT

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:20.385
BOTH EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS AND

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:22.621
REVENUE INCREASES WE THINK THAT

00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:24.222
LOOKING AT INCREASING FEES IS

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:26.124
REASONABLE GIVEN THEY HAVEN'T

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.659
BEEN INCREASED AND SO LONG. AND

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:28.960
WE THINK THAT THE EXPENDITURE

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:29.895
REDUCTIONS OF THE

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:31.630
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED ARE

00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.398
WELL TARGETED TO TRY AND

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:34.866
MINIMISE PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS.

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:36.101
THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:38.336
IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY SOLUTION

00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:40.171
IT'LL BE RIGHT BACK BEFORE YOU

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:41.973
IN A FEW YEARS AND WE THINK

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.874
THAT THERE COULD BE SOME

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:45.577
DIFFICULTIES BOTH FOR YOU AND

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:46.311
FOR STAKEHOLDERS IN LOOKING AT.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:48.013
HE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE NOW

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:49.681
AND THEN LOOKING AT INCREASING

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:54.352
FEES AGAIN IN A FEW YEARS. SO

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:55.553
YOU KNOW WEEK WE'VE SUGGEST YOU

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.688
MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ADOPTING

00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:58.390
A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION NOW

00:25:58.456 --> 00:26:00.025
AND THERE'S REALLY TWO WAYS YOU

00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:02.193
COULD DO THAT. THEY CLEANEST

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.129
WOULD BE TO ADOPT A FULL I'M

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:06.431
GOING SOLUTION NOW WITH I'M

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:08.934
GOING- THE INCREASES THAT AND

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.302
EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS THAT

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:12.237
COVER THE WHOLE THE WHOLE THING

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.205
YOU'RE FACING- BUT THAT COULD

00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:15.774
BE COMPLICATED TO TRY AND PUT

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.075
TOGETHER IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS

00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:18.109
PARTICULARLY IF YOU WANT TO

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:19.911

OUR ARMED AREA OF CALIFORNIA

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:46.382
WHO ARE IN- THE WORK OF ENERGY-

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.684

YOUR YOUR YOUR BUDGET. THEY

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:53.689

THEY CONTINUE TO PAY HIGHER

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:09.372
FEES. AND CONTINUE TO SEE A

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:13.743
SLOWING. OF THE ACTUAL DUE

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:18.047
PROCESS THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:19.181
TO I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:24.820
PARTICULARLY- NOBLE TO

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:27.223
ESSENTIALLY USE THE

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:29.392
BUREAUCRATIC OPERATION TAKE

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:31.160

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.208
LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE USING

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:51.013
THE OPERATION. TO SAY NO FOUR

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.016
WAIT OR MAYBE INSTEAD OF

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:57.520
GETTING TO A YES IT IS TOO SLOW

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:59.021
AND IT IS CAUSING SERIOUS

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:01.590
DAMAGE I THINK TO THE ABILITY

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:03.292
OF CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE ITS

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:06.562

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:33.756
THINK PROVIDING A TARGET DATE

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.592
IS A LITTLE TREACHEROUS- IT

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:39.362
BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON- HOW THE

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:41.030
ACTUAL INTERVIEW PROCESS GOES

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:43.532

WHO'S GOING TO JUST ASK A

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.295
COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE HAVING TO

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:54.930
DO WITH MR PATTERSON'S QUESTION

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.031
I'M SORRY THAT HE ASKED A LOT

01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:57.633
OF QUESTIONS AND WANT TO STICK

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.101
AROUND TO HEAR THE DISCUSSION.

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:01.337
BUT HE MENTIONED THAT- THESE

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:02.538
OPERATORS ARE PAYING FOR

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:03.839
PERMITS AND THAT YOU'RE TAKING

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:05.908
A LONG TIME TO GET TO A YES ARE

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.343
THEY ALWAYS GUARANTEED TO GET A

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:08.711
YES FOR EVERY SINGLE PERMIT

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:10.246
THAT THEY APPLIED FOR IS THAT

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:11.180
IS THAT THE GUARANTEE THEY PAY

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.849
THIS MONEY YOU DO THE REVIEW

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:14.383
AND THEY ALWAYS GET THEIR

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:18.087
PERMIT. IF THE REVIEW FINDS

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:21.223
FALLS. IN IN THEIR- APPLICATION

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.325
THEN THEY DO NOT GET A PERMIT-

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:25.628
SO I WOULD SAY THAT IF THEY DO

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:26.996
CONTINUE TO COME BACK WITH IT.

01:09:27.062 --> 01:09:28.297
THAT'S CORRECT THE INFORMATION

01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:29.732
THAT WE NEED TO PROCESS THE

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:32.034
PERMIT. EVENTUALLY THEY MAY GET

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:33.569
THE PERMIT. BUT IT'S NOT

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.037
GUARANTEED IF THEY CANNOT.

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.472

NEEDED TO TAKE ISSUE THE FROM

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:39.942
THAT. SO HIS HIS ARGUMENT THAT.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.410
SOME OF THESE OPERATORS ARE

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:43.479
IMMEDIATELY GETTING A YES-

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:44.680
DOESN'T REALLY. SOUND LIKE

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:45.648
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S SUPPOSED

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.049

CAN GET A PERMIT BUT THEY'RE

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:03.098
NOT GUARANTEED TO ALWAYS GET A

THEM. YEAH I CAN DO THAT

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:54.710
QUESTIONS OF WOMAN- WE

LAST FEW YEARS I WILL HAVE TO

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:01.784
FOLLOW UP TO GET THE EXACT

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.485
NUMBER WAS OF AN ABANDONED BUT

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:05.821
I KNOW THE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN-

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:07.623
THERE'S A RIGOROUS PROCESS TO

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:11.694
CLEAR- WELL ORPHAN- TO ALLOW US

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.362
TO USE IT. ARE YOU DO YOU STATE

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:16.231
FUNDING. THERE ALSO ARE OTHER

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:19.168
LIMITATIONS SOMETIMES ON ACCESS

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:21.236
TO SITES THAT- THAT MAKE IT

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:23.072
CHALLENGING I KNOW- THERE'S A

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:24.606
SIDE NORTH L. A. COUNTY THAT

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:25.541
WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET YOU

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:27.342
BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCESS ROAD

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:28.477
AND WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:30.479
THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY IT TO

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:32.247
REDO THE ROAD BECAUSE WE CAN'T

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:34.450
GET A BREAK THEIR TO. ABANDON

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:36.351

THE FUTURE OF THESE X. I

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:54.603
BELIEVE. YEAR WE DID SPEND THE

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:55.971
THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:59.842

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.247
APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN MILLION

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:07.449

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.860
AND STIMULATION ACTIVITY. BUT

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.328
EXISTING PROJECTS DON'T HAVE TO

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:54.630
OPERATE UNDER THOSE STRONGER

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:56.632
