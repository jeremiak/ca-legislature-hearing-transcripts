SO.

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:54.110 region:rollup2
BASED ON THAT DESCRIPTION IT

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:56.379 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SOUND AS THOUGH THAT

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:57.614 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE --

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:59.716 region:rollup2
ARE ANY MORE QUALIFIED TO

01:06:57.614 --> 01:07:01.818 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY.

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:03.253 region:rollup2
FALSE INFORMATION THAN ANYONE IN

THIS ROOM --

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:07.156 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S IT'S A

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:08.591 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP BUT WITH WORKING

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:10.460 region:rollup2
GROUP CENTER ESTABLISH ALWAYS

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:12.629 region:rollup2
COME ALONG SOME OTHER LAW THAT

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:14.464 region:rollup2
FURTHER ESTABLISHES THE IS THIS

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:16.666 region:rollup2
GROUPING TO DECIDING WHAT IS

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:18.801 region:rollup2
TRUE AND WHAT IS UNTRUE.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:21.437 region:rollup2
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:22.805 region:rollup2
GIVEN WHAT I HAVE HEARD.

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:24.974 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO BE A PANEL OF

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:27.043 region:rollup2
EXPERTS WHO CAN FOLLOW THROUGH

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:29.312 region:rollup2
ON ON THE DESIRE WHICH IS TO BE

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:30.980 region:rollup2

THAT I MEAN.

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:38.354 region:rollup2
RESPECTABLE PEOPLE WERE

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:40.490 region:rollup2
MENTIONED BUT NOT NECESSARILY

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:42.825 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED SO I'M NOT SURE THAT

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:44.093 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY IS THE ANSWER TO THE

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:45.228 region:rollup2
PROBLEM I THINK EVERYONE IN HERE

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:47.230 region:rollup2
WOULD AGREE.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:49.198 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:51.234 region:rollup2
NEWS BEING DISPERSED OUT THERE

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:52.802 region:rollup2
THAT IS UNTRUE PART OF THAT

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:54.003 region:rollup2
COMES FROM --

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:57.140 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:59.842 region:rollup2
THIS THE MEDIA WHO.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:01.711 region:rollup2
IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BE FIRST --

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:03.947 region:rollup2
AREN'T ALWAYS FACTUAL WHEN THEY

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:05.481 region:rollup2
FIRST GET A STORY OUT AND THAT'S

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:08.251 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIMES HOW SOME OF THESE

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:08.851 region:rollup2
FAKE NEWS STORIES CAN PERPETUATE

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:09.953 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THEY START OFF YOU

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:13.156 region:rollup2

BE ABLE TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM I

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:23.533 region:rollup2

01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:19.481 region:rollup2
HASN'T NECESSARILY BEEN ANY.

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:21.049 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES WITH THIS

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:30.926 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:32.294 region:rollup2
TIMES WHEN THERE ARE OTHER

01:25:30.926 --> 01:25:33.762 region:rollup2
EVENTS GOING ON IN SOME OTHER

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:53.649 region:rollup2
WITH THE GUN SHOW BEING HELD AT

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:55.450 region:rollup2

FOR FOR THEM TO HAVE THIS SHOW

01:26:00.589 --> 01:26:05.827 region:rollup2
AND UNTIL THERE'S A SOME SORT OF

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:06.461 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY MATTER AT HAND --

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:14.870 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE SHOW TO CONTINUE TO GO

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:16.204 region:rollup2

PROHIBITION.

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:28.684 region:rollup2
WILL NOT ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:30.886 region:rollup2
AS THE CURRENT LAW ALREADY

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:32.621 region:rollup2
REQUIRES ALL FIREARM

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:34.222 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONS AT THE COW PALACE

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:37.492 region:rollup2
OR ANY OTHER.

DEALER STORE.

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:46.334 region:rollup2
INDEED WHEREVER A FIREARMS

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:47.869 region:rollup2

OF JUSTICE HAS COMPLETED THE

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:02.684 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BACKGROUND CHECK.

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:04.319 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT THE

CAL POLICY IS A DISTRICT

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:08.523 region:rollup2

FROM THE STATE BUDGET.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:14.229 region:rollup2
IT LIKE OTHER DISTRICT

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.697 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS

CONCERTS AT CENTER.

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:28.844 region:rollup2
PROHIBITING GUNS JONES AT THE

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:31.813 region:rollup2
COW PALACE NOT ONLY ELIMINATES A

01:27:28.844 --> 01:27:33.415 region:rollup2
LEGAL VENUE FOR THE SALE OF

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:34.516 region:rollup2
FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:35.851 region:rollup2

THERE SEEMS TO BE A QUESTION

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:02.304 region:rollup2
HERE OF WHETHER THE LOCAL

01:29:00.936 --> 01:29:04.005 region:rollup2

ACCESS. TO PEOPLE SECOND

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:31.399 region:rollup2

I TO ME IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:17.610 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT INCREASES THE ABILITY

02:15:16.241 --> 02:15:19.478 region:rollup2

03:11:50.265 --> 03:11:52.434 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR

03:11:51.934 --> 03:11:53.769 region:rollup2
THIS EXCELLENT PIECE OF

03:11:52.434 --> 03:11:54.870 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

03:11:53.769 --> 03:11:56.305 region:rollup2
I JUST RISE WITH THE PERSPECTIVE

03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:57.973 region:rollup2
OF A PARENT AND SOMEBODY WHO'S

03:11:56.305 --> 03:11:59.475 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISE AN

03:11:57.973 --> 03:12:01.043 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN VIOLENCE IN OUR

03:11:59.475 --> 03:12:03.345 region:rollup2
SOCIETY I THINK THAT.

03:12:01.043 --> 03:12:04.613 region:rollup2
A LOT OF US THINK AND FEEL THAT

03:12:03.345 --> 03:12:06.281 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO MORE TO A

03:12:04.613 --> 03:12:07.182 region:rollup2
CRACKDOWN ON GUN VIOLENCE AND I

03:12:06.281 --> 03:12:08.684 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

03:12:07.182 --> 03:12:10.419 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT WE KEEP IN MIND

03:12:08.684 --> 03:12:11.787 region:rollup2
THAT THESE ARE COMMON SENSE

03:12:10.419 --> 03:12:12.688 region:rollup2
MEASURES THAT FOLKS ARE TAKING

03:12:11.787 --> 03:12:14.189 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT WHEN THERE'S

03:12:12.688 --> 03:12:16.191 region:rollup2
RESISTANCE TO COMMONSENSE

03:12:14.189 --> 03:12:16.859 region:rollup2
MEASURES IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING

03:12:16.191 --> 03:12:18.026 region:rollup2
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THIS

03:12:16.859 --> 03:12:18.594 region:rollup2
IS NOT SOMETHING.

03:12:18.026 --> 03:12:20.662 region:rollup2
THAT'S TRYING TO TAKE AWAY

03:12:18.594 --> 03:12:21.263 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S FIREARMS THIS IS NOT

03:12:20.662 --> 03:12:22.765 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S TRYING TO

03:12:21.263 --> 03:12:25.033 region:rollup2
IMPOSE ON REASONABLE STANDARDS

03:12:22.765 --> 03:12:26.034 region:rollup2
ON FOLKS THIS IS A COMMONSENSE

03:12:25.033 --> 03:12:28.604 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE THAT'S GONNA PUT

03:12:26.034 --> 03:12:29.505 region:rollup2

03:17:15.657 --> 03:17:17.726 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THERE IS THAT

03:17:16.858 --> 03:17:20.162 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEING MISSED HERE.

03:17:17.726 --> 03:17:21.630 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE HAVE.

03:17:20.162 --> 03:17:23.332 region:rollup2

03:17:25.701 --> 03:17:29.271 region:rollup2
GOING AFTER WE'RE MAKING IT

03:17:27.035 --> 03:17:30.906 region:rollup2

03:17:51.326 --> 03:17:54.029 region:rollup2

GOOD CONSEQUENCES.

05:04:32.688 --> 05:04:36.592 region:rollup2

THAT --

05:06:54.896 --> 05:06:59.468 region:rollup2
REQUIRES ANY SORT OF DRUG

05:06:56.431 --> 05:07:01.069 region:rollup2
TREATMENT SO.

05:06:59.468 --> 05:07:02.571 region:rollup2

USE AB DRUGS IT'S IT'S SORT OF

05:07:19.721 --> 05:07:23.692 region:rollup2
PERPETUATING ADDICTION WHICH IS

05:07:21.657 --> 05:07:25.961 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE

THEMSELVES AND NOT NEED THIS

05:07:31.800 --> 05:07:34.303 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF HELP SO I DON'T SEE

05:07:33.368 --> 05:07:35.304 region:rollup2
HOW.

05:07:34.303 --> 05:07:37.439 region:rollup2
OPENING THIS KIND OF CENTER

05:07:35.304 --> 05:07:39.374 region:rollup2

05:07:37.439 --> 05:07:39.942 region:rollup2
OVERDOSING AND ULTIMATELY DYING

05:07:39.374 --> 05:07:42.144 region:rollup2

05:07:39.942 --> 05:07:43.745 region:rollup2
WILL STILL KEEP THEM ON DRUGS

05:07:42.144 --> 05:07:45.447 region:rollup2
AND PARTICULARLY THESE TYPES OF

05:07:43.745 --> 05:07:46.982 region:rollup2
DRUGS THEY MAY NOT DIE FROM AN

05:07:45.447 --> 05:07:48.583 region:rollup2
OVERDOSE.

05:07:46.982 --> 05:07:50.385 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE VERY LIKELY GOING TO

05:07:48.583 --> 05:07:51.420 region:rollup2
DIE FROM OTHER COMPLICATIONS

05:07:50.385 --> 05:07:53.121 region:rollup2
OTHER HEALTH RELATED
