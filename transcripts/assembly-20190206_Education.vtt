FOR AS YOU KNOW BY THE GRACE OF

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:55.159
GOD.

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:55.893
ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.462
WERE SAFELY EVACUATED.

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:00.231
MOST MEMBERS FOR THE RELATIVES

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:00.831

OREGON NEVADA AND EVEN KANSAS.

OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:10.941
FIVE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:13.310
ASSOCIATION MEMBERS WHO LIVED OR

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:14.345
WORKED IN THE FIRE BRIMSTONE

HAVE ENTERED AN APPLICATION FOR

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.048
CTA DISASTER RELIEF GRANTS.

00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:18.883
ACCORDING TO OUR TEACHERS

SEVEN OF FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:24.088
TEACHERS WERE DISPLACED. SEVENTY

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:26.423
SEVEN OF THOSE LOST THEIR HOMES.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:27.458
SINCE THE FIRE OF GATHERED AND

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.993
DISTRIBUTED DONATIONS AND

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.494
INFORMATION IN ORDER TO ANSWER

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:31.762
MY MEMBERS QUESTIONS.

REASSURANCE TO MY FELLOW

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:35.566
COWORKERS.

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:36.500
THE BIGGEST ISSUE HAS BEEN

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:37.468
FINDING HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.436
WERE DISPLACED.

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:40.237
MANY TEACHERS ARE LIVING IN

00:40:40.304 --> 00:40:41.639
TRAILERS ARE SHARING HOMES WITH

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:43.040
FRIENDS OR FAMILY WHILE WAITING

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.975
TO REBUILD.

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:45.609
HOUSING IS STILL DIFFICULT TO

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:46.477
FIND A FEW COUNTY NOT ONLY

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.078
AFFECTING THOSE DISPLACED BUT

00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:49.446
ALSO ANY BUSINESSES TRYING TO

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:52.449
HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES.

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:53.818
MY DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS.

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:55.519
HAVE IN AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:57.721
JOB TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:58.322
REBUILD A SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM

00:40:58.389 --> 00:40:59.323
ALMOST NOTHING.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.291
INCLUDING SEARCHING FOR LARGE

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:01.292
ENOUGH FACILITIES FOR ALL OF OUR

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:03.627
STUDENTS AND STAFF.

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:04.962
THE NO FAULT OF OUR DISTRICT

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.497
COMMUNICATION WAS LIMITED DUE TO

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:08.299
SO MANY UNKNOWNS.

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:09.567
SO I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF AS

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.669
PRESIDENT TO BE THE LIAISON

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:12.303
BETWEEN THE DISTRICT OFFICE AND

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.637
MY TEACHERS.

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:14.805
IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS PEOPLE

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:15.806
WERE FILLED WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:18.142
THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:19.310
AND THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF ANXIETY

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:20.711
IS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.279
STILL HAVE THEIR JOBS.

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:24.014
WITHOUT A CLEAR BUDGET IN PLACE.

00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:25.382
OUR DISTRICT WAS INITIALLY

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.117
HESITANT TO STATE THE JOBS OR

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:28.185
SAFETY ON NOVEMBER.

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:29.286
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:30.454
UNINTENTIONALLY CAUSED UNDUE

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:32.523
STRESS AND TREPIDATION.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.924
RECENTLY THE CALIFORNIA

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:35.659
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:36.493
WORKED WITH OUR ASSISTANT

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.761
SUPERINTENDENT BUSINESS SERVICES

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:38.796
ON P. WESTIES BUDGET FOR THIS

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:40.731
YEAR AND NEXT YEAR.

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:41.599
THAT'S IT APPEARS WE CAN AVOID

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:42.600
MASSIVE LAYOFFS SO SOON AFTER

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:44.568
THE DISASTER.

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:47.805
HOWEVER BEYOND TWENTY NINETEEN

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:48.405
TWENTY TWENTY THE BUDGET IS

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:49.106
STILL UNKNOWN AND FILLS MY

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.674
TEACHERS WITH DREAD WONDERING IF

00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:52.643
OR WHEN THEY'LL HAVE TO SEARCH

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.145
FOR NEW JOBS AND LEAVE PARADISE.

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:56.847
I BELIEVE HAVING DISASTER PLAN

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:57.681
THAT INCLUDED PRE FIRE EIGHTY A

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.049
FUNDING FOR MULTIPLE YEARS

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:00.384
DEPENDING ON THE ENORMITY OF THE

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:01.685
DISASTER.

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:02.720
AND PORTABLE CLASSROOMS FOR

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:03.787
SCHOOLS THAT WERE DESTROYED

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:05.522
WOULD BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:06.690
FOR ADMINISTRATORS AND THEIR

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.259
EMPLOYEES WHEN FACED WITH THE

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:10.728
DISASTER SUCH AS THE CAMPFIRE.

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:11.829
THE IMPACT OF POSTTRAUMATIC

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:13.797
STRESS DISORDER ON FIRE VICTIMS

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.466
HAS BEEN CLEARLY EVIDENT.

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:17.468
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:19.536
OR NIGHTMARES ABOUT THE FIRE.

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:21.272
HIGHER BRAIN MAKES CONCENTRATING

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:21.772
OR MAKING DECISIONS VERY

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:24.275
CHALLENGING.

00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:25.542
DO THE UNCONVENTIONAL CLASSROOMS

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:26.677
HIGH VOLUME LEVELS OF BECAUSE

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.012
STUDENT OUTBURSTS.

00:42:28.078 --> 00:42:29.179
AND TEACHERS NEED TO TAKE MENTAL

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:31.181
BREAKS.

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:32.750
STAFFER EMOTIONALLY DRAINED AND

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:33.784
DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY AFTER

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:35.119
SCHOOL TO MAKE PHONE CALLS TO

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:35.686
TRY TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:37.421
TOGETHER.

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.123
DRIVING TO THE DEVASTATION TO

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.357
PROVIDE SERVICES TO STUDENTS IN

00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:41.625
THE GALLEY IN DECEMBER.

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:42.493
BECAUSE TWO OF OUR TEACHERS TO

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:44.328
RESIGN AND TWO OTHERS TO GO OUT

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.530
ON DISABILITY LEAVE.

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:47.965
PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:48.899
FIRE IN THE TIME.

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.134

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:54.305

I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN REDDING

00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:57.007

COUNTY CAME TO STAY WITH ME

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:03.080
BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN BACK WHEN

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:05.482
HE COULDN'T GO BACK TO READING

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:06.216
BECAUSE HIS PARENTS WERE

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:07.418
DISPLACED TO THE CAR FIRE IT'S

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:08.852
TIME.

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.087
EVERY MORNING AND EVENING WE

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:10.955
WOULD WATCH THE TELEVISION

00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:12.156

ENCOURAGING NEWS BOTH FIRES.

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:15.259
AND I REMEMBER THINKING HOW SAD

I WAS WATCHING THE CITY I GREW

PLAN THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:22.305
THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:23.573
COULD FORCE MORE STUDENTS AND

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.441
TEACHERS TO LEAVE.

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:26.810

NOW IN OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.002
THIS WAS OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE IN

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.704
LONG TERM ACTIVATION OF CD

EMERGENCY SERVICES HEADQUARTERS.

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:36.879
AND AND QUITE FRANKLY WE WERE

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:39.982
NOT WELL PREPARED.

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:41.383
WE WE HAD TO QUICKLY.

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:42.651

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:54.229
WE HAD TO GET USED TO THE THE

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.798
THE SOCK SCHEDULES REPORTS WE

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.800
LEARNED A LOT.

01:13:57.866 --> 01:13:59.067
WE LEARNED A LOT FROM OUR

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.736
COLLEAGUES AT CALLAWAY YES AND I

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:01.370

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:04.273
FROM SUMMATION ABOUT SCHOOL

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:06.208

AND IMPACTS THE SCHOOL

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.111
FACILITIES.

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:12.114
IN THIS WAS CHALLENGING --

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.682
IT WAS CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT IT

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:14.716
WENT AGAINST THE NATURAL FLOW OF

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.552

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.086

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:25.093
REAL TIME --

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.629
SECOND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.131
WAS IN NATURE LOCAL.

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:30.165
BECAUSE WE WERE LOOKING FOR

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.868
INFORMATION THAT WAS FROM INSIDE

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.102
AND IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:35.003
BURNS OWNS.

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.672
WE SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.106
GET THIS INFORMATION UNLESS WE

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:01.482
LIGHT OF WHAT WAS BETTER IN

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:03.584
EDUCATORS. FOR THE NEXT THREE

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:04.985

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:06.187
BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:07.855
WAS FINDING A WAY TO RE CONNECT

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:09.023
STUDENTS WITH THEIR TEACHERS.

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:10.558
THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS THAT OUR

STUDENTS WERE DISPLACED WITH

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:14.595
ALMOST EVERYONE OF THEM HAVING

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.130
NO HOME TO RETURN TO AFTER THE

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:17.765
EVACUATIONS WERE LIFTED AND

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.366
NEARLY AN ENTIRE TOWN.

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.235
HAVING BEEN TAKEN OFF THE MAP IN

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:22.703
THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:24.672
THAT MEANT THAT EVERY STUDENT

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:26.173
TRADITIONAL SCHOOL OR CHARTER

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.242

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:32.613
AND WE CHOSE TO SERVE THE MALL.

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.315
EACH BOARD MEMBER IS WARMER TOOK

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:35.182

THOMAS FIRE.

01:53:31.337 --> 01:53:32.539
A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SOMETIMES

GET FORGET FORGOTTEN ABOUT.

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:39.379

KIDS COME TO SCHOOL KIDS SAFETY.

01:53:43.816 --> 01:53:44.951
SAFETY ALWAYS TRUMPED LEARNING

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:46.219
IN THIS CASE.

AND THESE ARE PLEDGES WHICH

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:58.598
CONTINUE TO EXIST TO THIS DAY.

01:53:58.665 --> 01:53:59.899
A GREAT MANY THINGS WENT RIGHT

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:01.734
DURING THESE DISASTERS AS A

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:02.569
RESULT OF THE COLLABORATIVE

01:54:02.635 --> 01:54:03.903
CULTURE.

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:05.872
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTY

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:06.172
[inaudible]

01:54:06.239 --> 01:54:08.474
NONETHELESS PERRANCE. TO

01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:10.376
CONTINUE TO REMAIN CONCERNED

01:54:10.443 --> 01:54:11.644
ABOUT MISS LEARNING.

01:54:11.711 --> 01:54:14.047
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:15.648
WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN THE SCHOOLS.

01:54:15.715 --> 01:54:17.283
THE AMAZING THING IS THAT BOTH

01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:18.585
THE STUDENTS AND THE STAFF COULD

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:23.156
NOT WAIT. TO GET BACK TO NORMAL.

01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:25.225
SO WITH REGARD TO POLICY CHANGES

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:26.626
OR INITIATIVES GOING FORWARD.

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.562
COULD OFFER THE FOLLOWING --

01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:32.565
PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:35.635
QUESTION THAT I WAS ASKED IS.

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:37.971
ARE WE GONNA MAKE UP THE DAYS.

01:54:38.037 --> 01:54:40.974
AND I SAID I'M SORRY.

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.108
WE'RE GOING TO ME WITH MADE

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:43.776
WHOLE BY THE DAYS THAT WE LOST

01:54:43.843 --> 01:54:45.478
THROUGH A WAIVER PROCESS.

01:54:45.545 --> 01:54:47.146
BUT THERE IS NO MECHANISM NOR IS

01:54:47.213 --> 01:54:48.748
THERE AND IDENTIFIED FUNDING

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:51.484
SOURCE TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:53.319
LEARNING. FOR KIDS THAT MIGHT

01:54:53.386 --> 01:54:55.555
HAVE ONLY GOTTEN A HUNDRED AND

01:54:55.622 --> 01:54:56.289
SIXTY SIX OUT OF A HUNDRED

01:54:56.356 --> 01:54:58.024
EIGHTY DAYS BECAUSE OF AN

01:54:58.091 --> 01:55:00.126
UNFORESEEN DISASTER.

01:55:00.193 --> 01:55:01.761
SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:03.596
ABOUT I KNOW IT'S A HEAVY LIFT.

01:55:03.663 --> 01:55:04.664
THAT COMES THAT'S THAT'S A LOT

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:05.665
OF MONEY.

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:08.301
ALSO ENSURING THAT THERE ARE

01:55:08.368 --> 01:55:09.736
MEET EMERGENCY WAIVERS THAT

01:55:09.802 --> 01:55:10.570
AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER THAT DON'T

01:55:10.637 --> 01:55:12.672
NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE ASKED FOR

01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:14.841
OR WAITED FOR TO OCCUPY NON

01:55:14.907 --> 01:55:15.842
DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT

01:55:15.908 --> 01:55:16.976
APPROVED FACILITIES.

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:18.211
IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE

01:55:18.278 --> 01:55:20.847
QUICKEST RETURN TO OUR KIDS

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:21.547
LEARNING.

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:22.582
AND ALSO SOME PROVISION WITHIN

01:55:22.649 --> 01:55:23.916
THE STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:25.618
PROGRAM FOR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:28.288
DISTRICTS THAT DIDN'T EXPECT TO

01:55:28.354 --> 01:55:30.757
HAVE TO REBUILD THE SCHOOL OR

01:55:30.823 --> 01:55:32.125
RECONSTRUCTED SCHOOL.

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:33.593
AND WE'RE NOT IN LINE FOR

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:34.994
FUNDING THROUGH THE STATE

01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:36.095
ALLOCATION BOARD.

01:55:36.162 --> 01:55:37.630
I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE SOME

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:40.600
EMERGENCY FUNDING THERE BUT TO

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:42.669
PUT IT AT A HIGHER PRIORITY.

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:44.237
ON THOSE THAT WERE AFFECTED BY

02:10:52.044 --> 02:10:54.446
YEARS OUT THREE YEARS OUT AND

02:10:54.513 --> 02:10:56.381

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:58.183
THE TIME FOR THESE GUYS IN A

02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:58.750

02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:03.088
FUNNY INTERACT WITH THAT ON AN

02:11:03.155 --> 02:11:04.957
ONGOING BASIS BECAUSE THE

02:11:05.023 --> 02:11:06.391
STUDENT NUMBERS WILL DROP BUT

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:07.125
THEN THEY MIGHT SPIKE AT SOME

02:11:07.192 --> 02:11:07.693
POINT.

02:11:07.759 --> 02:11:08.927
TOO SO THAT IS TO BE A

02:11:08.994 --> 02:11:11.096
CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO HAVE --

02:11:11.163 --> 02:11:12.231
THE RE OPENING A REAL OPENING

02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:14.499
STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL AQM DIS

02:11:14.566 --> 02:11:15.901
ACROSS THE STATE AIR QUALITY

02:11:15.968 --> 02:11:17.536
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S A MILITARY

02:11:17.603 --> 02:11:19.538
THAT -- WE

02:11:19.605 --> 02:11:21.240
NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT WITH

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:22.040
THAT APPROACH BECAUSE LA IS SO

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:22.741
BIG.

02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:24.376
RIGHT AND AIR QUALITY OVER HERE

02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:25.277
IS THE SAME AS THE AIR QUALITY

02:11:25.344 --> 02:11:26.578
IS OVER THERE SO HOW DO THEY

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:28.513
MAKE THAT CALL WHAT KIND OF

02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:29.681
MONITORING TO THE EMPLOYEE.

02:11:29.748 --> 02:11:30.916
IF WE ARE TO HAND IT OVER TO THE

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:31.917
AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

02:11:31.984 --> 02:11:32.851
DISTRICT'S SO THAT'LL BE A

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:34.987

02:11:35.053 --> 02:11:47.332
WE HAVE MAKING THE COUNTY'S LEAD.

02:11:47.399 --> 02:11:49.434
BECAUSE THEY DON'T ALL AIR

02:11:49.501 --> 02:11:52.571
MONITOR ASH IN ASH DEBRIS.

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:54.573
CAM.

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.741
SO FOR THE COULD GET ALL AIR

02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:57.142
QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS.

02:11:57.209 --> 02:11:58.143
UTILIZING THE SAME AIR QUALITY

02:11:58.210 --> 02:12:00.312
MONITORING SYSTEM MY COUNTY IS

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:01.947
DIVIDED IN HALF.

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:03.415
SO IT'S LIKE HOW DO YOU GET A

02:12:03.482 --> 02:12:04.483
GOOD READING AND IF YOU GO TO A

02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:07.219

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:09.121
THAT'S LOCAL PEOPLE PUT THAT IN

02:12:09.187 --> 02:12:10.022
THEIR HOME JOURNAL WHERE THEY'RE

02:12:10.088 --> 02:12:10.589

02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:14.293
CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE TWO OKAY

02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:15.794
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WE HAVE

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:17.896

HOPE THAT THE THE SUIT STATE

02:12:43.722 --> 02:12:45.824
SUPERINTENDENT COULD ACTUALLY

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:46.925

PARADISE SURPRISINGLY --

02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:09.160
JUST BECAUSE OF THE THE WIND

GOOD POINT --

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:53.525
AND THE TRAUMA AND I WOULD BE

02:18:53.591 --> 02:18:54.459
REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY THIS IT

02:18:54.526 --> 02:18:56.161
NUMBER ONE IS IT IS WORKING WITH

02:18:56.227 --> 02:18:58.396
OUR STUDENTS AND OUR OUR OUR

02:18:58.463 --> 02:19:00.098
TEACHERS AND OUR PARENTS AND

02:19:00.165 --> 02:19:02.300
COMMUNITY BUT I'VE LISTENED TO A

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:03.668
NUMBER OF OURS SUPERINTENDENTS

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:04.803
TALK AND THEY'RE NOT DOING

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:06.504
ANYTHING FOR THEMSELVES.

02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:07.906
AND SO WE YOU KNOW AS A

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:09.240
REPRESENTATIVE OF THEM JUST

02:19:09.307 --> 02:19:10.375
MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE

02:19:10.442 --> 02:19:11.910
CONSIDERED A PRINCIPLES ARE

02:19:11.976 --> 02:19:13.945
SUPERINTENDENTS IN ANY KIND OF

02:19:14.012 --> 02:19:15.013
TRAUMA THAT IT ON CARE THAT'S

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:16.081
BEING GIVEN.

02:19:16.147 --> 02:19:19.050
AND THE OTHER THING THAT I GUESS

02:19:19.117 --> 02:19:20.685
IS THE LAST OF ONE LASTING

02:19:20.752 --> 02:19:21.953
SOMEONE MENTIONS IS THE CLASS

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:23.121
SIZE REDUCTION WAIVER BECAUSE

02:19:23.188 --> 02:19:24.456
WHEN YOU DO HAVE STUDENTS

02:19:24.522 --> 02:19:25.623
LEAVING --

02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:26.357
ONE COMMUNITY IN GOING TO

02:19:26.424 --> 02:19:28.560
ANOTHER SAME WITH YOUR TEACHER

02:19:28.626 --> 02:19:30.395
CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS --

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:32.130

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:33.531
TO BE WAIVED AS WELL AS I'M IN

02:19:33.598 --> 02:19:35.400
IN THE SORT OF SITUATION SO WE

02:19:35.467 --> 02:19:36.034
CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF ON A

02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:37.836
MANY OF THESE SORT OF IDEAS THAT

02:19:37.902 --> 02:19:41.840
HAVE COME FROM OUR MEMBERS.

02:19:41.906 --> 02:19:46.144
AND THE HE THE ONE OF THE THINGS

02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:46.978
THE ALSO THAT CAME UP WERE

02:19:47.045 --> 02:19:48.880
DISTRICTS THAT REMAINED OPEN

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:50.615
THAT HAVE A HORRIBLE AIR QUALITY

02:19:50.682 --> 02:19:51.850
AND SO WE HAVE DECENT THESE

02:19:51.916 --> 02:19:53.118
STORIES WHICH IS THE FIRE

02:19:53.184 --> 02:19:54.953
BURNING SCHOOLS AND BRING HOMES

02:19:55.019 --> 02:19:56.387
BUT THE IMPACT FOR THE FROM THE

02:19:56.454 --> 02:19:58.189
SMOKE HAS BEEN VERY.

02:19:58.256 --> 02:20:00.024
EXTREMIST AS ALL OF YOU KNOW SO

02:20:00.091 --> 02:20:01.793
SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS REMAINED

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:02.861
OPEN SO THAT THEY CAN FEED THEIR

02:20:02.927 --> 02:20:03.728
KIDS -- AND

02:20:03.795 --> 02:20:04.763
YET THEY DON'T GET ANY

02:20:04.829 --> 02:20:06.998
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE LOS EIGHTY

02:20:07.065 --> 02:20:08.733
EIGHT THAT OF THE PARENTS WHO

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:10.368
DECIDED TO KEEP THEIR STUDENTS

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:12.103
HOME. TO THE AIR QUALITY AND THE

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:13.438
SAME GOES FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT

02:20:13.505 --> 02:20:14.439
SHOWS TO CLOSE --

02:20:14.506 --> 02:20:15.607
AND THEN THERE'S THE WANT TO

02:20:15.673 --> 02:20:18.743
FEED THEIR STUDENTS AND THEY'RE

02:20:18.810 --> 02:20:19.377
NOT GETTING REIMBURSEMENT I KNOW

02:20:19.444 --> 02:20:21.713
THAT'S A FACT AS WELL.

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:23.047
SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES

02:20:23.114 --> 02:20:24.082

02:20:24.149 --> 02:20:25.383

02:20:29.587 --> 02:20:32.357
