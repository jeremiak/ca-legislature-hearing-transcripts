SEEING NONE I BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS WE MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU THINK HELLO. I COUNTY MITCHELL AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR FAMILY HEALTH AND A HAPPIER TODAY LESLIE GAFFNEY WHO'S THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR. I% WANTED HER TO BE HERE BECAUSE SHE DOES OVERSEAS ALMOST ALL THE FISCAL. AND ASSUMPTIONS PREPARATIONS THAT YOU'VE BEEN REVEALING BUT I WANTED TO BE HERE INCOME THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE OVERVIEW. THEM ALL ROTATE EACH OF MY DIVISION CHIEFS AND HERE HOT TO GET MORE DETAILED REPORTS. SO I'D THIS THE CENTER FOR FAMILY HEALTH HAS THREE MAJOR DIVISIONS ON THE GENETICS OF THE IT SCREENING PROGRAM. IS ACTUALLY LOCATED IN RICHMOND. FOR THE MOST PART THEY DELIVER HEALTHCARE SERVICE THEY DO MEDICAL BILLING FOR SERVICES FOR PRENATAL SCREENING. AND THEN THEY COLLECT FUNDS FROM HOSPITALS WHO IN TURN BILL FOR SERVICES RELATED TO NEWBORN SCREENING. THE DIVISION HAS I'VE I'VE. ACTIVITIES OTHER RELATED TO PRAY PROVIDING LOCAL SERVICES PARENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING EFFORTS. ON THE PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING HIGH QUALITY LAB SERVICES AND THEY MAINTAIN A BY A BANK OF SPECIMENS OF THE RESOURCE TO. OFFER RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND GENETIC DISEASES BOTH OLD AND NEW. THE SECOND DIVISION BOTH HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT'S A MATERNAL CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICES. ARE A DIVISION OR ADOLESCENT HEALTH DIVISION HERE IN SACRAMENTO. HOT RELIES ON TWO MAJOR FUNDING SOURCES TITLE FIVE BLOCK GRANTS. A TITLE FIVE BLOCK FEDERAL BLOCK GRANTS SPECIFY THAT AT LEAST THE THIRD OF THAT MONEY MUST BE USED TO SUPPORT CASE MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS. A THIRD FOR CHILD ADOLESCENT HEALTH AND A THIRD FOR MATERNAL HEALTH. AND THESE TITLES BY FUNDS HAVE TO BE ALLOCATED EVERY FIVE YEARS BASED UPON A FIVE YEAR NEEDS. A FIVE YEAR ON NEEDS PLAN THAT IT DIDN'T ASSESSMENT STATEWIDE LISTEN TO THE. ON AND AND GATHER EVIDENCE FROM OUR LOCAL HEALTH AGENCIES ABOUT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM. THAT WE DEVELOP A FIVE YEAR PLAN AND THE FIVE YEAR PLAN HOUSE TO ALIGN WITH WHAT THEY CALL STATE AND NATIONAL PRIORITY ME SIR SO WHAT'S. VERY RESTRICTIVE HIGH LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARE REQUIRED. THE SECOND MAJOR FUNDING STREAM IS ALSO FEDERAL MONIES TO SUPPORT OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAM. SO THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE THE KIND OF PARENT THEY'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF. I WE FIND THAT OUR HOME BUSY PARTICIPANTS ALL TALK OF THIS DREAM OF BEING A GREAT PARENT BUT THEY'RE SCARED OF REPEATING. MISTAKES OF THE PAST SO WE HELP THEM TO KNOW THAT EXPERIENCE IS NOT HAVE TO BE THEIR SOLE TEACHER. THERE IS ANOTHER WAY AND THEY EMBRACE THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE THIRD DIVISION AS THOUGH WOMEN INFANT CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAM. IT'S OUR BIGGEST DIVISION YOU KNOW WHAT WILD WICKED THAT. ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM WITH ALMOST TWO MILLION ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS ESTIMATED BY THE YOU FTA. SO THIS IS THE FINANCIALLY AT A HUGE BUSINESS ENTERPRISE CHEN CONNECT PARTICIPANTS TO THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THEIR NUTRITIONAL WELL BEING. AND RICK BOB ALSO SERVES THAT WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE LARGE FOOD BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HELP TO STOCK NUTRITIOUS WICK FOOD. AND MEAT ALL BRICK REQUIREMENTS SO WE CARE EQUALLY ABOUT EACH OF THESE GROUPS. ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD IS A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHIPS GOAL IS TO INSURE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY NUTRITIOUS FOODS TO HELP GET BABIES AND CHILDREN AFTER A GREAT START. SO MY JOB IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR IS TO WEAVE THESE THREE DIVISIONS A VERY VERY DIFFERENTLY BOTH FISCALLY. AND PROGRAMMATIC LEAD TO BELIEVE THEM TO NOT ONLY SEE HOW WE CAN MEET CURRENT NEEDS BUT ANTICIPATE ON OTHER FAMILY ISSUES AS THEY AND OTHER FAMILY CHALLENGES AS THEY ARRIVE. SO I DON'T WANT A REPEAT THE SUMMARY THAT'S IN YOUR BINDER I THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD ADVICE ON A TO GIVE YOU KIND OF A BROAD OVERVIEW OF HOW WE'RE ORGANIZED AND AGAIN WE CAN GO INTO MORE DETAIL. ON IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE PRESENTERS. THERE WAS ONE QUESTION THAT WAS DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TO ME AND THAT WAS HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO BE MATCHED WITH ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING. FOR FLP. ACTUALLY ALL OVER FEDERAL FUNDING THAT I THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT ISLAM ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED SO WE HAVE IN A DISH WE DON'T. WE HELPED TO MANAGE TITLE NINETEEN SO WE HAVE TITLE FIVE IN THAT'S ARGUMENT ALLOCATED AND WE HAVE TITLE NINETEEN MONEY AND THAT'S ALREADY HELP THAT ALLOCATED. BUT WITH ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING THERE WOULD BE YET ANOTHER ALL POTENTIAL TO ON. I'M NOT STATE FEDERAL FUND DOLLARS WITH TITLE NINETEEN DOLLARS BUT WE'RE CURRENTLY HAVE ALL APART MODEL FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOTT. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS I WANTED TO DRILL DOWN ON THE QUESTION IF I COULD IT SEEMS LIKE DURING RECESSION WE CUT STATE FUNDING. AND THAT DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDING THAT WE WERE RECEIVING. MY QUESTION IS IF WE WERE TO INCREASE STATE FUNDING TO HELP WITH THE ADOLESCENT FAMILY. PAT LIFE PROGRAM WOULD WE BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN FURTHER FEDERAL FUNDS AND IF SO AT WHAT RATE. AYE THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING IN PARTICULAR TO IS THE TITLE NINETEEN DOLLARS AND SUBTITLE NINETEEN. WILL MATCH STATE GENERAL FUNDS OR LOCAL STATE OR LOCAL GENERAL FUNDS ON IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE. ARM. SO IF WE HAD THAT MONEY AND WE HAD THE LOCALS WILLING TO COMMIT RESOURCES TIME THAT WOULD BE ON. APPROPRIATE FOR TITLE NINETEEN WE COULD THEN SEEK ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS THE LEGISLATURE IF WE WERE TO INCLUDE INCREASED FUNDING TO THIS PROGRAM. WOULD WE GET DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH FROM FEDERAL FUNDS OR IS THERE. A SPECIFIC RATE. IT WHAT'S TURKEY ABOUT AND NOT A LET LESLIE ANSWER TO IS THAT WE HAVE A TOTAL POT THAT WE CAN ALLOCATE TO THE WHOLE STATE. AND SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS BALANCE THE NEEDS OF AFL PIECE. SO WE HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN ABLE TO USE TITLE NINETEEN DOLLARS TO ENHANCE A FLP STATE GENERAL FUNDS. WE COULD FEASIBLY DO THAT FOR THE FUTURE TO AND THEN IT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS DEEPAK. DECIDE TO USE THOSE DOLLARS IF THEY'RE USING THEM WITH A HIGH LEVEL CLINICAL PERSON LIKE IN NURSES A SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE. UP REIMBURSEMENT IF IT'S JUST A REGULAR HEALTH COMMUNITY WORKER IT'S A FIFTY. UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. AND IF BY MAY WE'RE GOING TO SKIP TO ISSUES TEN AND ELEVEN SEQUENTIALLY. BECAUSE ONE OF OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAS HIS BIRTHDAY TODAY ALRIGHT. SO DON'T GO AWAY THERE'S MORE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CELLS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BUT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A BUSY DAY TODAY AND EVERYTHING. THAT'S GOING ON SO IN ADDITION TO IT BEING A VERY SPECIAL DAY. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S TIME AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON A NIGHT OF AND I DO HAVE A. SUPPORT. ON VALLEY FEVER AND I KNOW THIS SHERMAN YOU'RE VERY KEENLY AWARE OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT OCCURRED NOT ONLY IN THE VALLEY AND I THINK I'VE SPOKEN TO EVERY MEMBER ON THE COMMITTEE ALREADY ABOUT. THE SEVERITY THE VALLEY FEVER HAS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE WE KNOW THAT THEIR REPORTED CASES THAT FIFTY OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. WE KNOW THAT. CDC SAYS. ACCORDING TO THEIR ESTIMATES THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CASES EVERY YEAR THAT DON'T EVEN GO REPORTED. A INDIVIDUALS THAT DO HAVE. THE DO YOU HAVE VALLEY FEVER THERE SIXTY PERCENT OF THOSE THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT. AND SO. MISTER CHAIRMAN AS WE GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE ONLY STRUCK WITH WAS HOW DO WE COMBAT THIS ISSUE. HOW DO WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE SUFFERING? AND I WANNA THAT WEIGHS IS TO NOT ONLY SHOW THAT NEED BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS THAT WITH THE RESOURCES TO HELP TACKLE. THIS ISSUE AND SO I BEFORE YOU WE HAVE A BUDGET. REQUEST TO HELP DO THAT AND THAT'S DIVIDED UP INTO SEVERAL AREAS ONE OF THOSE AREAS IS AND RESEARCH. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS NO CURE AND THERE IS NO VACCINE FOR VALLEY FEVER ARE CURRENTLY AS IT STANDS TODAY THERE ARE EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO HELP DO THAT. AND FACT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN NAB SOME OF THOSE RESEARCH EFFORTS ALREADY. ARE WE'D LIKE TO HELP THEM BECAUSE THAT FUNDING IS DRIED UP NOW AS WELL. I'M AND ALSO PUBLIC AWARENESS YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING TO EACH OF OUR COUNTIES AND I'VE BEEN TALKING COUNTIES UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE. IT'S LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT IF THEY COULD CATCH THIS EARLY IT MEANS A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR THEIR HEALTH. MOVING FORWARD THINK A CATCH IT EARLY YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY DON'T SPEND THE REST OF THEIR ADULT WORKING LIFE ON DISABILITY. RIGHT A LOT OF THE WORKERS AND FAMILIES THAT I'VE TALKED TO THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. HAVE SAID WE WANT TO WORK AND WE WANT TO DO THINGS THAT WE WANT TO BE PRODUCTIVE. AND I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN TO BE TESTED EARLY SO THAT HOPEFULLY WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I AM I KNOW SPOKE AT EACH OF YOU GUYS ALSO ABOUT. AT SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY VALLEY FEVER ARE DIRECTLY. AND SO IT'S A IT'S WANNA IT'S AT THE SILENT EPIDEMIC WITH THE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE SEEN INCREASING JUST LAST YEAR. AND SO. WHAT THAT YOU KNOW I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE RESOURCES TO COMBAT OF VALLEY FEVER YOU KNOW DOWN AND? KERN COUNTY WE AT KERN MEDICAL CENTER AND THAT'S ONE OF THE FOLKS THAT WILL TESTIFY AS WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL ASK MYSELF SENATOR FULLER AND SOMEONE MEMBER FONG. VAST FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO GO TOWARDS VALLEY FEVER INSTITUTE AND I'LL LET THEM TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AS WELL. ARM BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IT WOULD REALLY BEHOOVE US TO DO SOMETHING FOR THESE FAMILIES AND I REALLY APPRECIATE EACH OF YOU TAKING THE TIME. ADVERSELY TALK ABOUT A SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS AFFECTED SOME OF THOSE FAMILIES. AND I ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD AFFORD. TO SOME SUPPORT AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BUDGET ITEM. THINK YOU'VE DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC WITNESSES WHO'D LIKE TO TESTIFY YES I HAVE THAT TIM CURLEY ON BEHALF OF THE VALLEY CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE AND ALSO RUSSELL GIANT ON BEHALF OF KERN MEDICAL CENTER CREEK. PLEASE COME FOR. YOU CAN TAKE A SEAT IF IT LIKE. DO YOU MIND FIFTH. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RUSSELL CHAD AND I'M THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF KERN MEDICAL. WHICH IS THE SPONSORING ORGANIZATION FOR THE VALLEY FEVER INSTITUTE. I. THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IS AT THE HEART OF VALLEY FEVER. THE SPORES GROW IN THE SOIL A THAT'S LOCATED THERE AND IT IS A SPREAD SIGNIFICANTLY AROUND THE COMMUNITY. OF COURSE WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF GETTING ANY FUNDING THAT WE CAN SECURE TO TREAT THE PATIENTS I AND THE COMMUNITY IN REGARDS TO VALLEY FEVER. BALLOT FEVERS NOT WELL KNOWN TO THE STATE. BED IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT IS PROBABLY THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT DISEASE THAT WE FACE. I WILL HAVE MORE PEOPLE DIE ABOUT FEWER THAN THE FLU EPIDEMIC THAT GOES TO THIS YEAR. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT EVENT AT THE KEY ELEMENT IS VALLEY FEVER IS NOT ALWAYS. DIAGNOSED IMMEDIATELY A MOST OFTEN IT PRESENTS IS PNEUMONIA HAD INDIVIDUAL BE ON ANTIBIOTICS FOR THREE WEEKS BEFORE THEY FINALLY SALE MAYBE IT. IS VALLEY FEVER AND BY THAT TIME HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT DISEASE. SO WE'VE GOT A WONDERFUL PHYSICIANS A LOT LOT OF PATIENTS A GREAT NEED AND WOULD ENCOURAGE THE FINDING OF A BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ON ASSEMBLYMAN SONGS. REQUEST OF FOR THIS VALLEY FEVER THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TIM CURLEY AND I'M DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS OF VALLEY CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE AND MADERA. WERE INCURRED BY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY BED PEDIATRIC SPECIALLY HOSPITAL IN MADERA BUT HOW THE HOST OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT. HOW THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM BAKERSFIELD NORTH TO? ACTUALLY SACRAMENTO AND I WANTED TO JUST SHARE WITH YOU OUR EXPERIENCE WITH RESPECT TO VALLEY FEVER AND KIDS. OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS VALLEY CHILDREN'S HAS SEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN BEING TREATED BY. FOR VALLEY FEVER. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE TREATED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH THIS DISEASE. AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAT NUMBER MORE THAN DOUBLED WITHOUT A CHILDREN'S TREATING THREE HUNDRED NINE CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH VALLEY FEVER. WERE FIVE MONTHS AND OUR CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE A CURRENT CASELOAD OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH VALLEY FEVER. SO WE'RE GOING EASILY SURPASSED NUMBER OF CHILDREN REPEAT RETREATED INTO SAU AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. ADDITIONALLY NOT ONLY ARE WE TREATING MORE CHILDREN WERE TREATING MORE CHILDREN FROM ACROSS A MUCH BROADER GEOGRAPHIC REGION. WITH THE PATIENT POPULATION TRADITIONALLY CENTERED IN A ROW AND IN AROUND KERN KINGS AND TULARE COUNTIES. TODAY WERE SEEN AND GETTING MORE AND MORE REFERRALS FROM REGIONS OUTSIDE OF THAT AREA EASILY NORTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FRESNO MADERA MERCED STANISLAUS COUNTIES. PAN OVER TO THE CENTRAL COAST SO REALLY KIND OF NOTICING THAT CREEP. WELL BEYOND KIND OF THE TRADITIONAL AREAS. AT VALLEY CHILDREN'S OUR TEAM A PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALISTS A AND OTHER PROVIDERS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES IN EFFORTS TO PROMOTE EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT A VALLEY FEVER IN CHILDREN. WE PROVIDE OUTPATIENT CARE INCLUDING AT OUR BAKERSFIELD PEDIATRIC OUTPATIENT SPECIALLY CARE CENTER. IN OTHER PIC A CARE CENTER IN MADERA. ALSO WHEN NECESSARY. WE PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE INPATIENT CARE IN A HOSPITAL IN MADERA. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. WE WE EXPERIENCED A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND AND FORTY AND ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED ONE PATIENT VISITS FOR VALLEY FEVER TREATMENT THAT INCLUDES INPATIENT OUTPATIENT AND EMERGENCY CARE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THAT NUMBER WAS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE SO IT'S ALMOST THREE TIMES. OF WHAT WE SAW A IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. IN ADDITION TO THE TO THE DIRECT% CLINICAL CARE WE PROVIDE TO PATIENTS WE HELP EDUCATE COMMUNITY PROVIDERS REGARDING HOW TO IDENTIFY SUSPECTED VALLEY FEVER AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. AND WHEN AND HOW TO INITIATE TREATMENT IN FACT ONE OF OUR PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST IS GOING TO BE CO PRESENTING WITH AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST FROM THE KERN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. IN EARLY APRIL TO A GROUP OF LOCAL PEDIATRICIANS AND LOCAL PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE GOT. THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO BE SURE TO A DIE IDENTIFY DIAGNOSE AND GET TREATMENT STARTED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. WE ALSO HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE VALLEY FEVER RESEARCH STUDIES. INCLUDING A STUDY LOOKING AT. OR ATTEMPTING TO INCREASE OUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE CYCLE SOCIAL ISSUES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH VALLEY FEVER FOR NOT ONLY THE CHILDREN BUT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. A AND THEN ARE ALSO LOOKING AT ANOTHER STUDY TO IDENTIFY IN BETTER UNDERSTAND ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEMS OF CHILDREN WITH VALLEY FEVER. AS COMPARED TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEMS OF CHILDREN WITHOUT A WITHOUT VALLEY FEVER PERFECTLY WHEN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE CHILD IN THE HOUSE BUT ONLY ONE CHILD. CONTRACTED VALLEY FEVER. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS AND THE EFFORTS OF SO MANY OTHERS A LOT MORE NEEDS TO BE A NEEDS TO BE DONE WE NEED TO REALLY DOUBLE DOWN ON OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AND TO INVEST IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. REGARDING SYMPTOMS DIAGNOSIS AND EARLY TREATMENT AND WE'RE HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PUBLIC A PATH PUBLIC EDUCATION OUTREACH. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY. THANK YOU SIR SUMMER FONG HAPPEN. INTO. I THINK WE KILLED THAT.

TO SEEK THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR RESEARCH GRANT AT THE KEY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO FIND OUT IF YOU WERE TREATMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH AT THE VALLEY FEVER INSTITUTE OCCUR MEDICAL A NEW IF YOU LOOK AT LOOK AT THE NUMBERS TWO DECADES AGO CALIFORNIA. AT SEVEN OR NINETEEN REPORTED CASES ABOUT A KEEPER LOOK AT NUMBERS TODAY THAT NUMBER HAS SKYROCKETED RISING TO OVER FIFTY THREE HUNDRED CASES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. OVER FORTY PERCENT THOSE CASES WERE FROM KERN COUNTY ALLOW. KERN MEDICAL HAS A LONG HISTORY. CARING FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM VALLEY FEVER AND HAS BEEN A LEADER IN PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE FOR THOSE IMPACTED BY THIS DISEASE. ITS DEDICATION TO SERVING VALLEY PEOPLE PATIENTS PROMPTED THE FOUNDING OF THE BALLOT DIFFERENCE TO.

TO RECEIVE THE SPECIALIZED CARE THE THREE MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING REQUEST WILL HELP TO EXPAND THE INSTITUTE SO THAT MORE PATIENTS CAN ACCESS QUALITY CARE CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PATIENTS WAITING TO SEE EITHER DOCTOR JOHNSON OR DOCTOR DARI. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ALLOW THE INSTITUTE TO ESTABLISH THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM VOTE A REPOSITORY OF SPECIMENS THAT WILL ENABLE ONGOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOP EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT WILL RAISE AWARENESS AMONG PHYSICIANS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

VALLEY FEVER REPOSITORY WHERE WE HAVE THE MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS THOSE SAMPLES THAT ARE GATHERED FROM THE PATIENTS WILL BE STORED AT THAT REPOSITORY AND THEN ALLOW TO BE USED AT RESEARCH. WHERE EVER THAT RESEARCH WANTS TO BE A PERFORMED A WE ARE AFFILIATED WITH UCLA? A ALL OF THE STUDIES THAT UCLA DOES THEY GET THEIR PATIENT SAMPLES UP FROM THE ABOUT FEWER INSTITUTE AT AKRON MEDICAL. EDUCATING PROVIDERS IS CRUCIAL. EVEN WITH US IN THE HEART OF THE VALLEY FEVER. IT GETS MESSED PARA AT THE BIG PRELIMINARY SIGNS MOST OFTEN IT'S VIEWED AS PNEUMONIA.

AYE WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS CAME TO ME AYE A I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO LIKE WHEAT WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME ABOUT THAT I'D HAVE NO IDEA BUT THEN WHEN HE SAW I SAW THE STATISTICS THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PEOPLE IN LA COUNTY. HAVE CONTACTED VALLEY FEVER MANY BECAUSE THE BECOMES MORE REAL I KNOW IT. FOR A COUNTY LIKE LA IT'S US VERY SMALL NUMBER BUT IF IT CAN BE PREVENTED I THINK THAT IT'S WORTH THE THE MONEY SO I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF OF YOUR REQUEST. BUT AGAIN AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE INFORMATION I THINK DATA SPEAKS FOR ITSELF AND I THINK THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT WE SHOULD TAKE AS DATA. DOES SPEAK AND THAT'S WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION SO I'VE SIGNED ON TO YOUR YOUR I REQUEST AS WELL BUT I WANTED TO JUST. ENCOURAGE. OTHER MEMBERS TO.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG ASSEMBLYMEMBER SOLACE NAM. HE HAS BEEN MY PARTNERS IN THIS. ON THE ANY THE THREE OF US IN THE VALLEY AND AS WELL AS DOCTOR ARAMBULA CROWN THE DIETS. I THINK THE FOUR OF US WE WE ALL GET IT THE BEST. BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY SEE IT ON A DAY TO DAY. HARD TO SEE OUR HOSPITALS GET INVOLVED A SEE THE RESEARCH GOING ON. DOWN WITH KERN. IT'S FANTASTIC TO SEE VALLEY CHILDREN STEPPING UP IN THE US ARE ALSO LOOK AT CLINICS IN VICE CITY AS WELL. WE'VE GOTTA DO MORE. AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THE PUBLIC AWARE. YOU KNOW SO THIS MEASURE OF THIS FUNDING. A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS TO DROP IN THE BUCKET FOR THE STATE AND IT'S A WORLD CHANGING. SAYING NOT IS FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE VALLEY BUT THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THIS. IS BASICALLY THE AT THE CENTER OF THE ENTIRE WORLD FOR VALLEY FEVER WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT HERE WE CAN STOP IT HERE. SO THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD IT'S GREAT TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON IT. THAT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU AS PARTNERS OF WHATEVER ABOUT THIS. OBVIOUSLY YOU UNDERSTAND THE DEVASTATION THAT IT REEKS THROUGHOUT NOT ONLY OUR COMMUNITY BUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. YOU NOTE RESEARCH WILL GO A LONG WAY ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR RESEARCH WILL WILL DO THAT. ITEM THE OUTREACH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. MR JUDD AT THE VALLEY FEVER INSTITUTE IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO OFFER A LOT OF ASSISTANCE AND HELP AS WE CAN CONTINUE TO COMBAT THIS. IS A REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BUDGET ASK. THANK YOU. I WILL CLOSE IF I MAY BY. SAYING THAT THAT THIS HOUSE LAST YEAR WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BUDGET ASK AND WE MAY WANT TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IF WE COULD ON THE OTHER HOUSE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE. THE SAME AMOUNT OF APPRECIATION THAT WE DO TO THE NECESSITY FOR YOUR. REQUEST FROM THE SECONDARY THING IF I COULD IS THAT. ANY YOU SEE RESEARCH STUDY WILL ALSO NEED A BUDGET ASK WITHIN SUB TO CUT AND SO WE WILL HANDLE AND DEAL WITH THE ONE MILLION ASK AS WELL AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FUNG'S ASK. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUES TEN AND ELEVEN OPEN FOR NOW AND MOVE BACK TO ISSUE FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK BEEN MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. SO ISSUE FOR IS ARE WE PROGRAM ESTIMATE AND CHRIS NELSON HEALTH DIVISION CHIEF BOB WICKETS HERE TO. PROVE THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON. SO THE WICK ESTIMATE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT FEDERAL FUNDING TO FOR A FULLY SUPPORT THE PROGRAM THERE'S NO IMPACT TO THE GENERAL FUND. AND THERE ARE NO POLICY CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATE THAT IMPACT PROGRAM SERVICES PUBLIC THROUGH A FEW HIGHLIGHTS ABOUT THE NUMBERS. THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE ESTIMATE IS WHAT WE SPEND ON FOOD DOLLAR SO OFF START THEIR OWN WE RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. AND REBATE FUNDS FROM OUR CONTACTED INFANT FORMULA MANUFACTURER WE MUST SPEND THE REBATE FUNDS FIRST. COST DRIVERS FOR THE PROGRAM ARM COSTS ARE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND FOOD COSTS PER PARTICIPANT. IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE EXPECT TO SPEND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON FOOD WHICH INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE INFANT FORMULA MANUFACTURER. FOR A LOCAL ASSISTANCE AT TO FIND THE LOCAL SERVICES THOSE FUNDS ALL COME FROM THE US DEPARTMENT AGRICULTURE AND WE ARE ANNUAL ESTIMATE CONTINUES TO BE THREE HUNDRED ONE MILLION DOLLARS. OUR STATE OPERATIONS AGAIN THIS FEDERAL DOLLARS AND OF BUDGET YEAR WE EXPECT TO SPEND SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FACING THE PROGRAM. AND THAT WU WILL BE OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ARE DECLINING PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND TRANSITION TO E. BITI THE ELECTRONIC BENEFITS TRANSFER. SO YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA WHERE SPOT OR SPOT ON THEIR. I'M IS QUESTION NUMBER ONE WHICH ELECTED JUST TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THE QUESTIONS. YES PART OF. BUT WHAT IS KNOWN AT THIS POINT ABOUT DECREASING PARTICIPATION SO AS WE'VE REPORTED IN THE PAST A WICK PROGRAM PARTICIPATION HAS BEEN DECLINING SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND IT'S DECLINING BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY. USDA REPORT OUT PRODUCES AN ANNUAL REPORT WHERE THEY ESTIMATE THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION AND THEN COMPARE THAT TO WHAT A DIFFERENT STATES HAVE SERVED TO CREATE THE PROGRAM WHAT THEY CALL PROGRAM REACH. AND JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH THEIR LOAD LATEST REPORT CAME OUT USING TWENTY FIFTEEN DATA. AT THAT FOR USING TWENTY FIFTEEN DATA THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR PROGRAM REACH WAS FIFTY TWO PERCENT AND CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER IS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT SO WE. OVER THE PAST. TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AT LEAST. CALIFORNIA HAS TYPICALLY BEEN ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN PERCENT. PERCENTAGE POINTS ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE HIGHEST PROGRAM REACH OF ALL STATES. HOWEVER OUR PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN DECLINING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SO THAT WE KNOW WE DEFTLY HAVE MORE WORK TO DO THERE. THERE'D BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES AND SURVEYS ASKING POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS OR PASSED PARTICIPANTS Y. THEY DIDN'T COME TO WECKER DIDN'T STAY IN WORK AND SOME OF THOSE. REASONS INCLUDE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE THEY WOULD QUALIFY SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING ON JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE IS. REALLY TAILORING OUR MESSAGE TO THE SPECIFIC INDICATORS THAT COME UP FROM THE SURVEYS SO THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE QUALIFY MAYBE THERE ARE WORKING FAMILY THAT THOUGHT THAT IF YOU HAVE A JOB YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE WITH PROGRAM. THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY NEEDED THE PROGRAM SO THAT COMES UP QUITE A BIT EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES THESE RESPONDENTS INDICATE THAT THEY DO HAVE FOOD INSECURITY ISSUES THEY STILL DON'T THINK THAT THEY NEEDED THE PROGRAM OR THEY WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER FAMILIES THAT MIGHT BE MORE IN NEED THAN THEY ARE. SOMETIMES AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AS HIGH. UP ON THE RESPONSE LIST AS THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUTWORKS I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT WHICH IS THE SPECIFICS OF WHERE TO GO ON WHO QUALIFIES THAT SORT OF THING THAT WE NEED TO. DO MORE WORK THERE. AND THERE'S OTHER. ACCESS ISSUES TRANSPORTATION TO THE WORK SITE OR TIME REQUIREMENTS ABOUT COMING TO AN APPOINTMENT. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO DO ADDRESS PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND WE'RE FOCUSED ON THREE DIFFERENT. GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS ONE IS RETAINING OUR ACTIVE. OPPONENTS OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME INTO THE WORK PROGRAM THEY'RE CERTIFIED THEY'RE ACTIVELY RECEIVING THEIR WHAT CHECKS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY IN THE PROGRAM. SECOND IS RE ENGAGING FAMILIES THAT ARE CERTIFIED BUT NO LONGER ACTIVELY COMING BACK TO RECEIVE THEIR CHECKS. AND THAT'S A PERCENTAGE THAT HAS BEEN GROWING A LITTLE BIT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND THE THIRD GROUP IS RECRUITING ELIGIBLE FAMILIES THAT ARE NOT CERTIFIED AWAKE BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND AS WELL THAT THIS LAST GROUP RECRUITING NEW FAMILIES. THEY MAYHAVE BEEN IN THE WITH PROGRAM IN THE PAST SO IT MAY BE THAT THE BABY WASN'T WAS ENROLLED AND WAKE AND% NOW THAT CHILD IS THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD. AND SO THEY'RE NOT ACTIVELY THEY'RE NOT CERTIFIED ANYMORE BUT THEY CERTAINLY ARE WELL AWARE OF WAY BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE COUPLE YEARS AGO OR MAYBE WITH OF. AN EARLIER CHILD. SO THINKING ABOUT THOSE THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF FAMILIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT KEY STRATEGY AREAS THE FIRST IS UNDERSTANDING DATA AND RESEARCH. AND ALL OF THEM SO WE ANALYZE TRENDS WE CONDUCT STUDIES WE UNDERSTAND A LOT OF STUDIES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND NATIONAL. THERE'S LOTS OF INTEREST IN DOING THESE TYPES OF REVIEWS SO WE WERE BEARING ABLE TO GET REPORTS FROM OTHER GROUPS TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHAT PARTICIPATION DECLINES. A WE'VE PREPARED DATA AND GEO MAPPING TOOLSFOR OUR LOCAL AGENCIES WE FUNDED LOCAL AGENCY PROJECTS TO CONDUCT AND EVALUATES INNOVATIVE PROJECTS. OUR SECOND KEEFE STRATEGY IS RE REVIEWING THE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE SERVICES IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND REMOVE BARRIERS SAW TALK LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT WITH MODERN COMMUNICATION AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS. AND LASTLY I'M OUT REACHING COMMUNICATIONS SO MAKING SURE THAT WE TAILOR OUR MESSAGE TO RESPOND TO THAT WHAT WE LEARNED UNDER THE FIRST DATA AND. RESEARCH AREA. I'LL GIVE IT UPDATE ABOUT EBT SO WE ARE ON TRACK TO IMPLEMENT EBT AHEAD OF THE FEDERAL DEADLINE OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. FROM THERE IS SOME REPORTS THAT COME OUT FROM DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND OFFICIAL PROGRESS HOME PROJECT REPORTS THAT I THINK. LA O. RECEIVES A COPY OF THAT AND WE'RE ALL IT ALL GREEN SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT. OF ONE OF THE KEY REQUIREMENTS IN IMPLEMENTING EBT IS TO REPLACE THE I. T. SYSTEM THAT WE USE BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES IT'S ABOUT TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD RIGHT NOW SO WE DO HAVE TO REPLACE THAT. WE ARE NOT DESIGNING A NEW SYSTEM WHERE PROCURING A WE'RE WORKING WITH% THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION WHICH IS WITHIN OUR AGENCY. AS THEY DID IN RFP LAST YEAR AND WE HOPE TO ANNOUNCE THE CONTRACT IN APRIL SO JUST IN A COUPLE WEEKS WILL BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE WHAT SYSTEM THAT WE'RE GETTING AND WHO THE CONTRACTOR AS. AND THIS WILL BE A SYSTEM THAT IS BEEN USED IN. ANOTHER STATE FOR WORK SO THAT'S ONE THE REQUIREMENTS OF USDA'S NOT TO BUILD A NEW SYSTEMS OR VERY HAPPY JUST TO TRANSFER SOMETHING WITH A CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOME ENHANCEMENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS IN THE SCOPE OF THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA BUT. WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING THAT I JUST IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR FOCUS IS SITTING SETTING UP AT NEW SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE. DEVELOPING TRAINING MATERIALS AND PROCESSES BOTH FOR THE STATE STAFF AND FOR THE LOCAL AGENCY THERE'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED LOCAL AGENCY SITES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. TO ROLL OUT THE NEW SYSTEM IN THOSE STATES AND TRAIN STAFF AS WELL. STARTING IN SUMMER TWENTY NINETEEN WHERE WE'LL BE PILOTING THE NEW SYSTEM AN EBT SERVICES WILL START AND SOLANO COUNTY AND DO THAT AGAIN SUMMER OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO WERE. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A YEAR AWAY FROM ACTUALLY HAVING EBT FOR WORKING CALIFORNIA. AND THEN AFTER THE PILOT WILL DO A TIERED APPROACH ROLL OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S OR NOT DOING EVERYBODY ALL AT ONCE WILL STAGGER IT SO IT'S A MUCH. BETTER FLOW AND LESSONS LEARNED AS AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WILL WE SHOULD COMPLETE THAT BY SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY. OF IT THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND FAMILIES IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. WE'RE ENGAGING LOCAL AGENCIES AND STORES ARE ARE AUTHORIZED VENDORS. BUT WE HAVE A A WORK GROUP THAT WERE SETTING UP BOTH OF STAKEHOLDER GROUP WITH THE AUTHORIZED VENDORS TO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING FOR THEM AS WELL AS THE LOCAL AGENCIES. AND A COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAMILIES OF COURSE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE HAVE OUR CONTACT FOR THE EBT SERVICES PROVIDER TO THAT'S THE BIKE THE BANKING PART THAT HAPPENS AT THE STORE. AND THEY ARE REQUIRED IN THEIR CONTRACT TO OPERATE A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CUSTOMER CALL CENTER AND WEBSITE FOR FAMILIES. THEY'RE DEVELOPING YOUTUBE VIDEOS OF THAT COULD BE SHOWN IN THE LOCAL SITES SO THAT FAMILIES COME IN AND THEY COULD SEE HOW DOES THE NEW CARD WORK CAN TO I NEED TO SEPARATE THIS FOOD OR. WHAT IF I HAVE A WHAT CARD AND I CAL FRESH CARD NAY USING BOTH AT THE SAME TIME YES YOU CAN USE IN BOTH AT THE SAME TIME? SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FAMILIES ARE A REALLY WELL INFORMED AND THOSE WRITTEN IT TEARS WILL BE IN EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SORT DOING THE SAME PROCESS THAT COW FRESHENED CAO WORKS IS DOING THEIR ABOUT THE LANGUAGE. I'M LAST THEY WILL HAVE AN APT WHERE FAMILIES CAN SCAM FOODS IN THE STORE TO SEE IF THEIR WORK AUTHORIZED THE CAN CHECK RIGHT THERE BEFORE THEY GET IN LINE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE PICKED UP THE RIGHT FIT. I'M QUESTION NUMBER THREE WILL TALK ABOUT MODERNIZING COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILY SO LAST YEAR I SHARED WITH YOU ARE NEW WITH MOBILE WEBSITE. AND WE'VE DONE SOME ENHANCEMENTS TO THAT SINCE LAST YEAR WE'RE ADDING A NEW BUTTON TO TALK OF TO ADDRESS BREASTFEEDING SUPPORT SO FAMILY AMONG MY MOM'S CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION. AND THEN WE ARE ABOUT TO ROLL OUT A NEW BUTTON THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SO LAST YEAR THERE WAS A SEARCH FEATURE WHERE FAMILIES COULD LOOK FOR WEARS AND WIKOFF RACE STORE. AND NOW THERE'S A NEW BUTTON LOOKED SO THEY CAN SEARCH FOR WHERE'S THEIR WIKOFF RIGHT FARMERS MARKET. THAT WAS NOT IN THE SYSTEM LAST YEAR SO WILL REALLY HAPPY THAT WERE ROLLING OUT FOR THE SEASON THERE. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP MORE ONLINE EDUCATION MODULES AND TOOLS. RC OUR OFFICE IS ALSO DEVELOPING SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGING EVERY CORNER AND SENDING THAT OUT TO LOCAL AGENCIES SOME OF OUR LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE THAT CAPACITY CAPACITY TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGES BUT OTHERS DON'T. OR WITHIN THEIR OWN PARENT COMPANY THEY MIGHT NOT BE ALLOWED TO SO WE'RE DOING THAT FOR THEM AND SENDING THEM OUT THEM EVERY QUARTER. WERE ALSO DEVELOPING NEW YOU TO WHAT WE CALL WEEK STORIES VIDEOS WHERE IT MIGHT BE A PARTICIPANT OR A FORMER PARTICIPANT IS TELLING ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT WEEK MADE FOR THEM AND WHY. IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM. WE ARE A CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE USE OF TEXT MESSAGING SYSTEM FOR OUR BREASTFEEDING PEER COUNSELING PROGRAM. THAT HAD BEEN KIND OF A A PILOT FOR AWHILE IN THE LIMITED NUMBER OF LOCAL AGENCIES AND WE'RE EXPANDING AT THE SPRING TWO ADAM ALL THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE THE PRESSING PEER COUNSELING PROGRAM. WILL NOW HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SYSTEM. AND LET'S SEE LOCAL AGENCIES ALSO USE TEXT MESSAGING FOR APPOINTMENT REMINDERS AS AS WELL AND ONE OF OUR LOCAL AGENCIES ARE INNOVATION PROJECTS IS PILOTING A TELEHEALTH PROGRAM TO OFFER HIGH RISK NUTRITION COUNSELLING VIA VIDEO CHAT. QUESTION NUMBER FOUR HOW MANY WHICH LANGUAGES ARE UTILIZED IN OUR WITH OUTREACH SO LAST YEAR REPORTED THAT WE WERE CONSIDERING ADDING KOREAN AND WE HAVE DONE THAT SO WE NOW HAVE TO OUR CORE MATERIAL THERE IN TEN LANGUAGES. ENGLISH SPANISH RUSSIAN ARABIC ARMENIAN CHINESE MONK KOREAN RUSSIAN AND VIETNAMESE. AND THESE LANGUAGES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DATA FROM OUR OUR IT SYSTEMS SO THERE'S A QUESTION AT THE WICK APPOINTMENT THE LOCAL SITE WHAT LANGUAGE DO YOU PREFER TO SPEAK AT HOME. SO THAT'S WHERE WE WE IDENTIFY THOSE LANGUAGES THERE. OUR NEW SOCIAL MEDIA OUTREACH MESSAGES ARE CURRENTLY ARE ONLY IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH AT THIS POINT. A MANY LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR OWN OUTREACH MATERIALS BASED ON THE LANGUAGE IN THEIR SPECIFIC AREAS AND SO THERE'S A FEW MORE THAT ARE HOW THAT ARE USED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. AND OF COURSE LOCAL AGENCIES HIRE STAFF THAT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE AND THAT FOR FAMILIES IN THEIR PARTICULAR AREA. QUESTION NUMBER FIVE IS ABOUT THE FOODS AND CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCE SO FEDERAL REGULATIONS OF PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE THAT WE USED FOR THE WITH FOOD PACKAGE AND LAST YEAR THE NATIONAL. ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE. AND I'M GONNA CALL IT SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND MATH ONE DAY. THEY MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE U. STA FOR CHANGES TO THE FOOD PACKAGING USDA NEEDS TO ADOPT THOSE THROUGH A FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND SO WHERE. I'M ANTICIPATING HOPEFUL THAT SOME OF THOSE CHANGES MIGHT BE COMING FORWARD SOME OF THOSE CHANGES INCLUDING INCREASES TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND OPTIONS TO SUBSTITUTE FOR CHIU VEGETABLES FOR JARRED INFANT FOR SOME JARRED INFANT FITS. I AM LAST YEAR I REPORTED TO YOU THAT WE HAD ALSO BEEN TARGETING. SPANNING THE FARMERS MARKET PROGRAM WE WANTED TO ADD MORE FARMERS MARKET THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR REPORTED THAT WE HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FARMERS I'VE OR FARMERS MARKETS IN. TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND NOW WE ARE AT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY IN THIRTY SIX COUNTY SO WE'VE ITEM. GROWN QUITE A BIT IN THE NUMBER OF FARMERS AND FARMER'S MARKET EXCEPT WICK. VOUCHERS OR THE SPECIAL SUMMER PROGRAM KEEP ON. COUPON. AND LASTLY I COULD STREAMLINING THE WICK APPLICATION HELP WITH PARTICIPATION RATES ONE OF THINGS THAT IT'S IS DIFFERENT ABOUT WAKE IS IT'S NOT JUST A STRAIGHTFORWARD APPLICATION PROCESS. THERE'S REQUIRED AND IN PERSON CERTIFICATION UPON APPOINTMENT. SO WE HAVE. THE FAMILY FAMILIES CAN MAKE AN APPOINTMENT A COMMAND OR MANY SITES ARE OPEN FOR AVAILABLE FOR DROP IN THIS WHILE. AND SOME LOCAL AGENCIES ARE PILOTING OF WHAT THEY CALL A PRE ELIGIBILITY A MODULE ON THEIR WEBSITE SO IT DOES LOOK LIKE AN ONLINE APPLICATION AND THERE AT ABLE THEN TO COLLECT A LOT MORE INFORMATION AHEAD OF TIME AND SO WERE. SEEING HOW THAT GOES TO THAT SPEED UP THE PROCESS I THINK WITH MY CERTAINLY MAKE FOR SHORTER CERTIFICATION APPOINTMENT WHICH IS PROBABLY DESIRABLE. I'M A BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH LOCAL AGENCIES TO IMPROVE THE PROPHECIES ABOUT FOR THAT CERTIFICATION POINT. APPOINTMENTS SO THAT THERE ARE FEWER BARRIERS TYROLEAN AWAKENED A HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE. ONE IS ALLOWING GRANT AND GRANDPARENTS AS CARETAKERS FROM NOW. USED TO BE THAT IF THERE IF THE PARENT WAS ON THE PROGRAM THAT MAYBE THE GRANDPARENT COULD BE ALTERED THAT BUT NOW YOU COULD HAVE BOTH AS. A OFFICIALLY LISTED. ANOTHER IS ADJUNCTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID BABIES. SO WHEN A CHILD IS BORN IF MOM WAS ON MEDI CAL. THAN THEIR OF THEIR ALREADY COVERED BY MEDICARE FOR AWHILE BUT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THEIR MEDICAL CARD RIGHT AWAY. AND SO ON WITH WE NEEDED THEM TO WAIT UNTIL THEY HAVE ABOUT MEDI CAL CARD OR WE WOULD PUT HOLDS ON THEIR BENEFITS AND THEY WOULD JUST GET INCREMENTAL BENEFITS AND NOW WE'RE SAYING. YEAR COVERED BY THAT BY MOM'S MEDICAID JUST AS MEDI CAL WHAT FOR SERVICES AS WELL. AND THAT CAME FROM LOCAL AGENCIES THAT MADE THAT SUGGESTION I THINK THEY'RE VERY HAPPY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT. TYPICALLY THE TRACKING NUMBERS ARE ON THE SAME ON ALL THE CARDS CORRECT. LET'S SEE IT MOM GETS THE MEDICAL CARD AND THEN THE KIDS GET A CARD BUT THE THE NUMBERS ARE THE SAME. THAT I'M I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT ON THE MEDICARE PART NO. IT'S USUALLY MOST TO HEALTH CARDS. THE. THAT THE CODING NUMBERS ARE THE SAME FOR THE PARENTS AS FOR THE KIDS. THAT SOMETHING IN THAT WAY IF IF MOM'S CARD IS THE SAME NUMBERS AS THE KIDS CARDS IN THE SYSTEM THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO PUNCH IN THE NUMBERS AND LOOK IT UP AND GO HERE'S HOW MANY CHILDREN. FALL UNDERNEATH THIS PARENT. THAT I'M I'M SORRY HAVE TO. CHECK INTO THAT BUT IT BUT NOW WE ARE SHOWING THAT. ALLOWING THAT IF IF MOM HAS MEDI CAL HAS THE BABY THEN THAT'S FINE YES WILL GO AHEAD EXCEPT THAT WOULD. WERE OFFERING TO YOU WANT ONE THAT WE CALL FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IS HEMOGLOBIN SCREENING. AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS DONE AND A REGULAR BASIS IN THE PEDIATRIC OFFICE BUT IT STILL IS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE WICK PROGRAM. SO WE'RE NOW OFFERING IN HOUSE HE MICHAELMAS SCREAMING SCREENING AND WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING THE SERVICES FOR THREE MONTHS SO WE USED TO BE WE'D SAY YOU NEED TO GO TO THE DOCTOR AND GET A HEMOGLOBIN SCREENING WE CAN'T GIVE YOU BENEFITS I WOULD MATT JUST GIVE YOU ONE MONTH. AT A TIME NOW WILL GIVE THREE MONTHS OF TIME. WE HAVE EXPANDED MAILING OF THE FOOD VOUCHERS TO PARTICIPANTS THAT PER FOR ONLINE NUTRITION EDUCATION SO NUTRITION EDUCATION IS REQUIRED EVERY QUARTER. AND MANY OF ARE YOU. FAMILIES PREFER ON ONLINE EDUCATION BUT THEN THEY STILL HAVE TO COME INTO THE SITE TO PICK UP THEIR CHECKS WHICH COMETH. MIGHT DEFEAT THE WHOLE PURPOSE SO WE'VE PLAYED THAT CHANGE AS WELL. AND I'M WE'VE ADDED MORE FLEXIBILITY AND BUT WE. HOW TO BRING IN DIFFERENT DOCUMENTATION IN THIS TYPE CUT TIES BACK TO THE MODERN COMMUNICATION? SO MANY FAMILIES NOW THEY DON'T GET A THEY DON'T GET THEIR BILL A KNOW MAYBE THEIR ELECTRIC BILL OR SOMETHING A HARD COPY THEY DISCREDIT ELECTRONIC AND WE USED TO SAY YOU HAVE TO BRING IN THE BILL BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE BILL. NOW THEY JUST HAVE A COULD SHOW US ON THEIR PHONE OR A PICTURE OF THE PHONE THAT SORT OF THING SO IS ANOTHER. VERY RECENT CHANGE THAT WE'VE MADE. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALIONA COMMENTS ON ISSUE FOR. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR. KAREN FARLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA WITH ASSOCIATION THE MEMBER ASSOCIATION FOR THE EIGHTY THREE AGENCIES. WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE GREAT WORK THAT THE STATE AND EIGHTY THREE AGENCIES ARE DOING. CHRIS ONE UNDERSCORE THIS CRITICAL PERIOD THAT WE KAZAN. BECAUSE OF A CHRIS DESCRIBE THE DECLINING PARTICIPATION WHICH IS VERY WORRISOME IN CALIFORNIA HAS A STELLAR REPUTATION ACROSS THE NATION. FOR BEST PRACTICES AND. WHAT THAT MEANS IS KID FEWER KIDS ARE IN THEIR FAMILIES ARE GETTING FED BUT IT'S ALSO A THREAT TO? OUR FEDERAL GRANT EVENTUALLY PERHAPS AND THE HEALTH OUTCOMES IT WHICH IS PLAYED SO MUCH ROOM OVERALL IN PRETERM BIRTH. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT ANEMIA BREASTFEEDING CHILDHOOD OBESITY I MEAN WICKS A STAR PROGRAM IT'S A TREASURE. SO THE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE VERY CONCERNED AND WE SERVE ALL YOUNG FAMILIES. AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE YOUNG MOMS WANT TO BRING THE MEN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WAKE. HAS SUCH A LONG HISTORY OF DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE NATION SO. I THINK WE ALL PLAY A ROLE IN IN REALLY SUPPORTING OUR STAFF IN THE LOCALS IN HOW TO REALLY. KEEPER TREASURE ON GOING WELL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT OF PRINTED UP THE DIES FOR ANY MOMENTS WE MAY HAVE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND A BID OF CONGRADULATIONS IF I CAN IT DOES APPEAR THAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING A VERY GOOD JOB FOR PARTICIPATION. I WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IF I CAN HOW WE CAN HELP TO STREAMLINE THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND I THOUGHT YOU DID A GOOD JOB OF ANSWERING IT. BUT IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY THAT THE STATE COULD DO TO HELP TO IMPROVE THE APPLICATION PROCESS. AS DELAYS AND RECEIVING WHAT BENEFITS MAY. LEAD TO LOWER PARTICIPATION ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO HELP WITH THAT PARTICIPATION. AT AT THIS POINT OUR OFFICE IS CONTINUING TO REVIEW. THE FEDERAL UP POLICIES I'M OFTENTIMES THE. THE THE FEDERAL REGULATION SAYS THE STATE SHALL DO THIS OR IT MIGHT SAY THE STATE SHALL. FIND OUT OF THEM. FIND A WAY TO DO THAT SO SOME OF THEM ARE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AND SOME ARE NOT. SO OUR OFFICE GO IS GOING THROUGH REALLY WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB ALL OF THOSE POLICY REGULAR. THE STATE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF THE FAT OF THE THE FEDERAL RULE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO SO WHERE THAT REALLY IS A KEY FOCUS OF OUR OFFICE RIGHT NOW I'M WORKING WITH. THAT CALIFORNIA RICK ASSOCIATION IN OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AS WELL TO DO THAT. AND I'LL JUST ADD MY TWO CENTS IF I CAN COMING FROM AN AGRICULTURAL AREA LIKE MINE. I'M QUITE ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE INCREASED PARTICIPATION OF THE FARMERS MARKET. AS THAT WHICH COMES FROM THE GROUND IS USUALLY VERY GOOD FOR OUR BODIES AND. QUITE HAPPY THAT YOUR SUPPORT ABOUT THAT. WITH THAT WE WILL HOPE A WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FOR OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE. AND COMING UP TO JOIN ME HERE IS A LIGHTLY CALLALOO SKI I DON'T THINK SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO AND. GET YOU LAST TIME CITIES ARE NEW DIVISION CHIEF YOUTH. ACTUALLY BEEN HERE OVER A YEAR BUT WE DID WANT TO EXPOSE IT TO THE THREAT AWAY IN SCARECROW AT. AND SO. LESLIE CAME TO US FROM THE MARCH OF DIMES LA WESTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR MARCH TIME SHE IS A LIFETIME COMMITMENT TO THESE ISSUES WERE REALLY PLEASE SUCH AS JOINED US AT THE DIVISION CHIEF. ANCHOVY ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR HOBBIES THE KEY ON THAT HOME VISITING PROGRAMS. HELLO. AND I JUST WANNA JUST. JUST POINT TO THE FACT THAT YOU GOT A LOT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION IN THE IN THE IN THE UPDATE AND WE'RE JUST REALLY PROUD OF OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAM. AS YOU MAY KNOW IT'S IT'S FUNDED BY FEDERAL FUNDS WE WE GET ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FROM THE FEDS TO TO FIND A PROGRAM. THAT IS IN TWENTY THREE COUNTIES TODAY WE HAVE CONDUCTED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND HOME VISITS WERE REALLY PROUD OF THAT WE'VE SERVED OVER EIGHT THOUSAND FAMILIES. AND CURRENTLY WE CARRY CASELOAD OF AROUND TWO THOUSAND FAMILIES. SO WE HAVE BEEN WHERE YOUR QUESTION IS IS CAN YOU CAN COMPARE CAN YOU COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE DSS PROGRAM. AND WE DEFERRED OF THEM TO TALK ABOUT THEIR PROGRAM WE CAN GIVE YOU DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROGRAM. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE CARRY OUT TO EVIDENCE BASED MODELS FOR OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAMS. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ABOUT ELEVEN HOME VISITING PROGRAMS THAT ARE BASED ON EVIDENCE ACCORDING TO THE TO THE FEDS. WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DSS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND WORKING WITH THEM IN THEIR WORK GROUPS. AND WE HAVE WE KNOW AND ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER AND TO CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE ON THE UPSTART OF THEIR PROGRAM. WE HAVE A BASIC SET OF OUTCOME DATA THAT THAT WE REPORT OUT TO THE FEDS ON AND WE HAVE BEEN SHARING THAT INFORMATION. WE KNOW THAT OUR PROGRAMS ARE NOT A DUPLICATION WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE COMPLEMENTARY WITH SIMILAR GOALS. BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THE DSS PROGRAM IS MORE FOCUSED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH OUR PROGRAM WE HAVE A LOT OF STATE OVERSIGHT. AND WE HAVE WE'VE GOT A LONGER PERIOD THAT WE AND ROLL FAMILIES THEN. SO THAT'S THAT'S JUST A SHORT A SHORT UPDATE AND ANY ANY QUESTIONS. WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLIER WHEN HE COMES? ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE FIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR OF ASKING ON BEHALF THE NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THE CALIFORNIA HOME VISITING PROGRAM. AND ARE JUST HAPPY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HAVING EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING EXPANDED AS MANY CHILDREN YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA'S POT IS POSSIBLE. TO IN THE MOST POSITIVE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT OUR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. ARGUMENT. HIGHER IMPALA WILL HOME AND I'M REPRESENTING THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOME VISITING PROGRAM. THANK YOU THANK HIM. SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENTS ON BRING IT UP TO THE DIOCESE CAN. YOU KNOW I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CUT SIXTY MINUTES THIS PAST WEEK BUT WE HAD OPRAH TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING I'M QUITE PASSIONATE ABOUT AS WELL ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND IN THE RIGHT NOPE TO EXPLAIN HOW SPECIFICALLY THIS PROGRAM IS ATTEMPTING TO INCORPORATE ACES ABSOLUTELY. SO HOME VISITING HELPS PARENTS IN THE IDENTIFIED AT RISK COMMUNITIES GIVE THEIR CHILDREN A SOLID START IN LIFE SO HELPING THE PARENTS HELP THEIR CHILDREN HAVE A NURTURING AND SUPPORTIVE. ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO GROW UP. WE WE ALSO KNOW THAT PARENTS THAT ARE OFTEN IN HOME VISITING SUFFER FROM OR HAD AN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE AS OF THE PROGRAM ALSO IDENTIFIES THEIR NEEDS AND HOW TO HELP THEM WORK THROUGH THOSE THOSE ADVERSE CHILD. BUT EXPERIENCES. EVEN THOUGH HOME VISITING IS NOT SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS A SAYS WE KNOW THAT MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE LINKED HOME VISITING TO THE REDUCTION AND SUPPORT OF OF A SAYS. SO WE KNOW THAT ASUS CAN IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND LIFE AND LIFE COURSE OUTCOMES AND ACHIEVE THE THE GOALS THAT WE ALL WANT FOR OUR FAMILIES AND FOR IT AND FOR THE CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT THE OUTCOMES ADDRESS BY HOME VISITING INCLUDE BECOMING A TEEN PARENT SMOKING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ALCOHOL ABUSE ILLICIT DRUG USE TOXIC STRESS SUICIDE AND DEPRESSION. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LINK TO TO HELPING ADDRESS THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES HIS IS THE NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP. SCREENING BOTH THE PARENTS AND THE CHILDREN FOR. CASE IS OR HOW SPECIFICALLY DO THEY. THAT START. UP. THAT. ACKNOWLEDGING AND FINDING THAT WE HAVE US AND WE HAVE A SET OF THERE'S THAT THERE'S A MODULE THAT START THAT STARTS FROM DAY ONE ADDRESSING THEIR AT THE DIFFERENT. INDICATORS THAT THE MODEL SETS OUT TO ACHIEVE AND SOME OF THOSE FALL IN THE WHEEL HOUSE OF OF ACES AND SOME OF THEM ARE ARE BROADER. I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION I KNOW YOU ANSWERED IT WELL ABOUT DSS BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WERE COMPLIMENTING. PROGRAMS AND NOT DUPLICATING HOW CAN I. HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT. THE TWENTY. THREE TO TWENTY THREE COUNTIES THAT YOU'RE RAN. IT. HOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BROADEST REACH POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT? BOTH OF THE HOME VISITING PROGRAMS ARE HELPING OUR YOUNG FAMILIES. BUT NOW I RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY SIT ON THE STATE INTERAGENCY TEAM ON YOUTH AND CHILDREN AND THERE'S A WORK GROUP ON HOME VISITING AND SO. BOTH OUR DEPARTMENT OUR DEPARTMENT AND DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES ARE ON THAT BUT THAT SPECIFIC. GOAL OF COORDINATION. MOM I THINK THAT CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO REALLY BE. AND THE INITIAL START UP PHASE WITH OUR LOCAL AGENCIES BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRYING TO. IDENTIFY THE THE PAIR THE YOUNG PARENTS THE PREGNANT AND PARENTING WOMEN. THEY'LL HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAYBE TRIAGE THEM A LITTLE BIT AND TO WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST PROGRAM OUT WHERE MY BY WHERE MY THINK ALL WORKS LEARNING HOW TO DO SOME BRAIDED FUNDING WHERE MAYBE WE CAN EXPAND. ON THE UNIVERSE OF. APPLICATIONS USING. FUNDING STRATEGY SO. I THINK WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF TRYING TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I THINK THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL AGENCIES. TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS FUNDING TO MAXIMISE ON THE ENROLLMENT OF CLIENTS. WELL I. HOW AND WITH A COMMENT IF I CAN I WAS QUITE PROUD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PASS AB THREE FORTY LAST YEAR WHICH ALLOWED ACES TO BE SCREENED UNDER EP STT? AND WOULD HOPE THAT THE UPCOMING GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR HOME VISITING PROGRAM CAN ALSO FIND WAYS TO USE THIS ASUS SCREENING. I LIKE OPRAH OR MIGHT EXCITED ABOUT THE REAL POTENTIAL THAT ACES OFFER AS A KEY TO HELPING TO. DEAL WITH CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. WE NEED TO TURN THE QUESTION FROM. HOW DID OUR KIDS AND UP LIKE THAT TO WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM? AND I BELIEVE BASE IS REALLY IS THAT TOOL AND HOPE WE CONTINUE TO USE IT SOME. WITH THAT'LL PASS INTO ASSEMBLY MATHIS. SO WELCOME THANK YOU HARM. EVERYTHING HE SAID. DID TO BREAK THIS DOWN A LITTLE BIT SIMPLER WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT. WHAT CAN WE DO TO BREAK THE CYCLE? THIS IS SAID A MINUTE ONE OF THOSE BIG THANKS TO THE QUESTION AS TO. NO REDUNDANCIES WE WE ONLY HAVE A FINITE AMOUNT RESOURCES AS WE DO YOU HAVE TO WORKS ON. VERY GLAD OF OF YOUR ANSWER. SEEN WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO WITH THESE KIDS TO TO GET THERE AND TO GET. IN THE HOME THEY I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS. BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY YOU CAN GET ONE STORY FROM PARENTS AND CAN REACH OUT YOU CAN DO ALL OF THAT UNTIL YOU STEP FOOT INTO THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND I SAY AND FIRE MEANT BECAUSE WHAT YOU GO THROUGH THAT THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR WAY. IT COULD BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD. AND SO THE WORK YOU GUYS ARE DOING ITS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WITH ACES AND EVERYTHING TO REALLY LOOK AT THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT THIS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THESE KIDS. WHOSE PARENTS AND THEIR PARENTS THEIR GRANDPARENTS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS LIKE IN THIS IS LIKE OWES THOSE PEOPLE. BUT THIS IS HOW WE TAKE BILLS PEOPLE ONLY BRING THE MEN. AND WOMEN SHOULD THAT THAT NEXT GENERATION IS A CONTINUING TO GO DOWN THAT PATH AND WE DO BREAK THE CYCLE. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HOW THIS COMES OUT MAY. GIVE. WITH THAT I WILL HOLD ISSUE FIVE OPEN AND HOPEFULLY WE WEREN'T TOO PAINFUL. THANK YOU. TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX. DOCTOR RICHARD ALL NAY IS NOW JOINING US IS THE DIVISION CHIEF FOR GENETIC DISEASE SCREENING. AND IF I MEAN FOR RICHMOND. I THINK YOU HAVE HONOR. THANK YOU. SO FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE GDS P. ESTIMATE A LIST A TOTAL TEST UNDER HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AND AS DOCTOR MITCHELL MENTIONED EARLIER THAT'S BE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE GENETIC DISEASE TESTING FUN. THAT REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF ABOUT A HALF A MILLION OVER SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ESTIMATE AND AROUND ONE AND A HALF MILLION OVER THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. THEY'VE ONLY BEEN SLIGHT CHANGES IN OUR CASE LOAD THIS INCREASE IN OUR BUDGET FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS LARGELY DUE TO EXPENDITURES REQUIRED. TO COMPLY WITH A NEWBORN SCREENING EXPANSION PROVISIONS ENACTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THROUGH SP TEN NINETY FIVE. AND THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY AT TO NEWTON TO NEW DISORDERS TO THE CALIFORNIA NEWBORN SCREENING PANEL AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. DUE TO THEIR RECENT ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL RECOMMENDED UNIFORM SCREENING PANEL. AND THAT'S POMPEII DISEASE AN AND PS ONE. OTHER INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES WILL BE REQUIRED FOR EXPANSIONS AND TESTING IN OUR LAB IN RICHMOND FOR THE NEW DISORDERS. AND THAT'S REQUIRED TO BEGIN BY AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ARE THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS WILL REQUIRE A NEWBORN SCREENING FEE INCREASE OF TWELVE DOLLARS PER SPECIMEN FOR THE NEW DISORDERS. AND THAT WILL BRING THE TOTAL FEE UP TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS EFFECTIVE IN JULY. THE FEW INCREASE WILL PRIMARILY COVER THE COSTS OF ROUTINE TESTING WITH OUR LABORATORY DEVELOPED TESTS. AND EVENTUALLY THE COSTS OF PROCESSES INVOLVED WITH ROLLOUT OF FDA APPROVED TEST KITS. IT COULD BE USED IN OUR REGIONAL LABORATORIES. APPROVALS BY THE FBI ARE PROJECTED TO OCCUR AROUND TWENTY NINETEEN. AND WE WOULD PLAN TO IMPLEMENT SCREENING IN THE RITUAL LAPS OVER TWO TO THREE YEARS. SO THAT'S IT FOR. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELIA. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX. SEEN NONO BRING IT TO THE DICE. JUST I I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE. NAY IN IT'S GOTTA BE SAID NAM.

SPECIAL NEEDS SO WHEN ME AND MY WIFE HAD HER TWINS WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE CAUGHT MY SON'S. SPINA DEFERRED OUT IN VERO. AND SO I AND A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. BUT WHAT IT ALLOWED ARE MY FAMILY NAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE BECAUSE I KNOW. ON REALLY GENETIC SCREENING. PEOPLE THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR DON'T NECESSARILY SEE IT THE WAY I DO KNOW. IS THAT IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN WHAT THE FUTURE'S GOING TO BE LIKE AND FOR US TO PREPARE OUR FAMILY THAT'S WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DEAL. ALMOST AT THE HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR FAMILY OF HEY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHILD THAT IS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS. AND IT ALLOWED US TO SAID. KIND OF THE PATH FORWARD FOR HEM. AND SET UP THE CONVERSATIONS OF WHAT KIND OF THERAPY IN THINGS HE'S GONNA NEED AND HAS LIFE. NOW HE'S AFTER FIVE SURGERIES HE'S FULLY RUNNING AROUND AND GET SOMEBODY ELSE RUN FOR THEIR MONEY. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND HEALTH. THANK YOU GUYS FOR WHAT YOU DO. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. OKAY. ISSUE SEVEN IS OUR NEWBORN SCREENING BCP. AND WE'VE LISTED AROUND A TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND ONGOING EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY FROM THE GENETIC DISEASE TESTING FUN. AND THIS INCLUDES FIFTEEN NEW POSITIONS FOR PERSONNEL. WHO WILL PERFORM ALL ASPECTS A SCREENING IN OUR LABORATORY TO COMPLY WITH THE UPDATED HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE RELATED TO THE NEW DISORDERS?

ARE WE ALREADY DO SOME SECOND YOU'RE TESTING FOR SOME CONDITIONS SUCH AS ADRENAL CATASTROPHE AND THE SOUL EXPAND IT TO. METABOLIC CONDITIONS. AND AS DISPLAY IN THE ESTIMATE THIS OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREASE WILL BE OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF THE SAME AMOUNT AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING. A BY DECREASING OUR COSTS FOR FOLLOW UP OF FALSE POSITIVES SCREENS. AND FOR UNNECESSARY CONFIRMATORY TESTING. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA A. SEEING NONE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN.

WHAT MULTIPLE PROGRAMS WITH YOU SEE THE P. H. PARTICIPATING IN THE RESPONSE TO THE RECENT HEPATITIS OUTBREAK? PROGRAMS WITHIN THE SENATE FORTY PICTURE THE FIFTH LEAD THE RESPONSE BUT IT WOULD MEMBERS FROM MANY OTHER CENTERS AND OFFICES WITH YOU SEE THE PH ALSO PARTICIPATED. MORE IMPORTANTLY LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES IN EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE EFFECT OF HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. WHERE ARE THE FOREFRONT OF THE RESPONSE WORKING IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH CVP AGE? HOWEVER WITHIN OUR CENTER FOR HELD UP WITH ENOUGH IN A FREE PICTURE THIS HE SAID. STOP THE VERY VERY CRITICAL WORK THAT WAS CRITICAL IN CONTINUING TO CONTAIN THE OUTBREAK. WE WERE KEY IN IDENTIFYING THE OUTBREAK IN MOUNTING ANOTHER RESPONSE. WE HAD THE NEPHRITE OUTBREAK ASSOCIATED CASES TO SPECIALIZED LABORATORY TESTING. WE MONITOR THE INCIDENCE OF THE CEASE AND PROVIDE A REGULAR REPORTS ENSURING CONTROL ENFORCEMENT PROPERTY TARGETED. WE PROVIDE IT EXPERT GUIDANCE TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER PARTNERS. WE WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO THE CURRENT STATE OF EMERGENCY. WE PROCURED DISTRIBUTED AND MONEY TO OR OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND HEPATITIS A VACCINE DOSES. EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND FEDERALLY FUNDED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND STATE FUNDED. WE COORDINATED ENSURE TECHNICAL AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. AND WE INSURE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. A QUESTION NUMBER TWO. WHAT WERE THE LESSONS LEARNED RELATED TO THAT CONTAINING OF HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK? WE LEARNED THE LACK. OF ACCESS TO ADEQUATE HYGIENE FACILITIES. SENATOR LIVING ENVIRONMENT AND HEPATITIS A VACCINE. RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF CASES OF HEPATITIS A. WITH ELIZABETH HOSPITALIZATIONS AND MORE THAN TWENTY DEATHS. THERE IS AN ONGOING RISK A FEW PICTURE THIS IS SPREAD DUE TO THE LIVING CONDITIONS FACED BY HOMELESS PERSONS AND PERSONS WHO USE DRUGS. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE RECENTLY CONTRIBUTED FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF ALL THEIR THE HISSING CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING SYPHILIS AND TUBERCULOSIS. INJECTION DRUG USE POST THIS PARTICULAR THIS IS TRANSMISSION RISK FOR HIV. HEPATITIS C. AND SERIOUS BACTERIAL INFECTIONS. THE RESPONSE TO THESE LARGE OUTBREAK REQUIRED A COORDINATED EFFORT BETWEEN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY VACCINE MANUFACTURERS. THE CORNELIA MANAGEMENT OF LEAVING IT THIS IS CONTROL RESOURCE US IN THIS CASE VACCINE. WAS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN HELPING US CONTAIN THE EPIDEMIC. THEY MAY POPULATION SUNDRESS FOR HEPATITIS A IN THIS OUTBREAK PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND OR ILLICIT DRUG USE. IS A VERY CHALLENGING POPULATION TO REACH. THE CITY AND IS A GROUP MAY NOT BE READILY IDENTIFIED. DELIVER YOUR PREVENTIVE SERVICES IS DIFFICULT AND COSTLY AND OPTIONS FOR ISOLATION TO PREVENT DISEASE TRANSMISSION A VERY LIMITED. FOR EXAMPLE THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO THE LIVER VACCINE THIS OUTBREAK. WAS TAKING VACCINE INTO HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS THIS REQUIRED TEAMS OF THREE PEOPLE WITH A NURSE TO PROVIDE THE VACCINE. A PEACE OFFICER FOR SAFETY IN A COMMUNITY WORKER TO PROMOTE TRUST AND VEXING ACCEPTANCE AMONG THE POPULATION. THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGES FOR THE CORRECTION WAS CRITICAL TO PROCURE VACCINES. ENSURE ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF VACCINES AND FOR THE EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF COMPLEX THINGS. QUESTION NUMBER THREE. HOW COULD THE STATE RICH SUFFICIENT HEPATITIS VACCINATION RATES TO ACCOMPLISH HERD IMMUNITY? HERD IMMUNITY IS ALREADY INCREASING USED THE INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES THE HAVE RECOMMENDED. THAT ALL CHILDREN RECEIVE HEPATITIS A VACCINE. TRANSMISSION OF HEPATITIS A IN CALIFORNIA HOUSE FALLING SHARPLY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE. WHEN WE ARE NOT THAT I CHILDHOOD VACCINATION REQUIREMENT. THEREFORE DO THEY MOST CHILDREN ANOTHER LISTEN CALIFORNIA ARE PROTECTED AGAINST HEPATITIS A. HOWEVER AS WE KNOW SOME GROUPS REMAIN A TIGHT RACE FOR HEPATITIS A TRANSMISSION PARTICULARLY ADULTS WHO ARE AT HIGH INTEREST OF EXPOSURE TO HEPATITIS HAY. THESE GROUPS INCLUDE HOMELESS PERSONS. PEOPLE USING ILLICIT DRUGS MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN AND PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL TO COUNTRIES WHERE HEPATITIS A IS COMMON. TO EXPAND HER IMMUNITY TARGETED INEFFICIENT AIRPORT FOR HIGH RISK ADULTS WOULD BE REQUIRED. AND QUESTION NUMBER FOUR. WHAT ARE THE PREDICTABLE RACING OFF INCREASE HEPATITIS A INCIDENCE RATES IN LIGHT OF THE STATE'S INCREASING HOMELESS POPULATION? HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK SOMEONE HOMELESS PERSONS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST BUT THEY HAVE BEEN UNCOMMON. HOWEVER IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ALONE THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN HOMELESS PERSONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HOUSE ALONG OF THAT ARE PERSONS LIVING IN SITUATIONS WITH INADEQUATE HEIGHT YOU POSSIBILITIES AND SUNNY PATIENT. AND LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. THERE WILL BE RISK OF HEPATITIS OF HEPATITIS A TRANSMISSION. AS WELL. AS TRANSMISSION OF ALL THE DISEASES INCLUDING TUBERCULOSIS. CONCOMITANT RACE FACTORS LIKE DRUG USE INCREASE THE RISK OF HEPATITIS A SPREAD. AIN'T TO THIS RISK FOR OTHER THE SEASON SUCH AS HIV. INCREASING HEPATITIS A IMMUNITY FROM COVERAGE WOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF HEPATITIS AND TRANSMISSION. BUT WILL BE DIFFICULT AND WILL NOT ADDRESS THE RISK UP ON THE DE CSS. ADDRESSING KEY UNDERLYING FACTORS SUCH AS ACCESS TO STABLE HOUSING. DRUG TREATMENT AND MENTAL ILLNESS SERVICES RQ WAYS TO DECREASE OVERALL RISK. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS ON HEPATITIS A ALL YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO. FESTIVITIES HAD ABOUT THE QUESTIONS ON HEPATITIS FIRST I THINK I'D LIKE TO ASK A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON HEPATITIS IF I COULD YOUR TIME. AND I PROBABLY NEED TO BACK UP HALF A SECOND AND TELL YOU PART OF THE REASON WHY I'M SO INTERESTED AM I WENT TO GO VISIT ONE OF THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS IN SAN DIEGO. AFTER THE OUTBREAK AND. BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAW AND. EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND WHEN I CAME BACK TO FRESNO. I WANTED TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS TO GET VACCINATIONS AND HELP TO INCREASE AND SEE IF WE COULD GET TO HER COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE STRUGGLES WE FOUND IS AN INABILITY TO ACCESS. THE VACCINE BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO USE IT AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO I WANTED TO UNDERSTOOD AND IF I CAN WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE VACCINE MANUFACTURERS. HOW QUICK WAS THEIR RESPONSE TO WHAT LEVEL SHOULD WE BE? I'M AT STRIVING TO VACCINATE HOMELESS. WOULD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BENEFIT FROM A PROGRAM TO PROACTIVELY. CREATE HERD IMMUNITY WITHIN OUR HOMELESS POPULATION BECAUSE OF THE RATE OF INCIDENCE AND RECENT SPREADS THAT WE'VE SEEN. RIGHT. SO GOING BACK TO THEIR EARLIER STAGES OF THE OUTBREAK ARE AT THE TIME WHEN WE HAD A DEL BREAKING CALIFORNIA THERE WERE OUTBREAKS OCCURRING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE MANUFACTURE AT THE TIME THAT WAS PRODUCING HEPATITIS A VACCINE. SO WE WERE FACING A SITUATION WHERE THERE WASN'T A NOVEL SUPPLY OF HEPATITIS A VACCINE NATIONALLY. ARE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD A SUPPLY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN KILEY SHARING WITH US BUT THEY WERE RUNNING SHORT AS WELL. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IN DECLARING THE YEAH EMERGENCY IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THEY GAVE US ACCESS TO BOTH ADDITIONAL HARM DOSES OF VACCINE THAT WE COULD PURCHASE. BUT ALSO GAVE US CONTROL IN TERMS OF WHERE VACCINE DOSES WILL BE ALLOCATED. THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ACTED OUTBREAKS ENACTED TRANSMISSION OUR MAIN GOAL WAS TO ACTUALLY BREAK THE TRANSMISSION CYCLE FIRST BEFORE WE COULD VACCINATE ANYONE ELSE. SO OUR DOING THAT REALLY ALLOWED US TO FOCUS ON THE COUNTIES WHERE WE HAD ACTIVE ONGOING TRANSMISSION WHICH WAS SAN DIEGO. LA SANTA CRUZ ARE PRIMARILY A TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BROUGHT A TRANSMISSION TO A TO A HALT. I AND IN DOING SO YOU KNOW WE PRIORITIZE BY COMMISSIONER THOSE POPULATIONS. HOWEVER WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE ALL THE HYPE IS POPULATIONS IN THE STATE AND SO WE. WANTED TO MAKE VACCINE AVAILABLE FOR OUT RISK COMMUNITIES IN DOES A COMMUNITY IS A YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE VACCINE AVAILABLE. BOB NOW THAT. THE VACCINE SUPPLIES GETTING BETTER ON WE UNDERSTAND THAT MANUFACTURERS HUTS WRAPPED UP AND THERE'S MORE VACCINE AVAILABLE. I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT I WEAR A POINT WHERE WE CAN START FREEING UP MORE OF THE VACCINE SUPPLY. SO THAT WE CAN I GIVE IT TO OTHER POPULATIONS THAT MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE OUTBREAK. BUT THAT ARE AT RISK FOR HOW ABOUT LIKE TO SAY. I IN THIS CASE GOING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION. WHETHER OR NOT THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WILL BENEFIT FROM CAPITALISM VACCINATION. ARE I THINK THAT THEY WOULD AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY. BECAUSE THE CDC CONSIDERS HOMELESS YET. RISK FACTOR FOR BUT I THINK NO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDED GROUPS OR VACCINATION. BUTTING COLLEAGUE CALIFORNIA WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT UNLESS WE CAN INCREASE VACCINATION RATES IN THE COMMUNITY. AYE IS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE. ANOTHER THING WE LEARNED DURING THE OUTBREAK CONTROL IS THAT YOU KNOW MOST HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY DO QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL. SO IN WORKING WITH LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IN ROLE. MOST OF THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS CAN OPERATE ACTUALLY HE MADE THE COUNCIL THE MEDICAL WOULD REIMBURSE. FOR THE COST OF THE VACCINATION SO THE REAL CHALLENGE IS TO REACH TO THE POPULATIONS FINE PEOPLE. AND GET HIM TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE VACCINATED BUT I THINK WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO THOUGH IT. DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF NUMBER OF. POTENTIAL. HOMELESS POPULATION THAT WOULD NEED THE VACCINATION AND THE A COST BOTH TO. HELP WITH THE START UP BUT ALSO ANY. PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR US TO WORK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENTS TO. TRY TO COME UP WITH A FIGURE IN LIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR US TO TRY TO GET AHEAD OF. THE BALL GOING FORWARD IS A STATE AND WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT AFTERWARDS. YEAH ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HAS PROVEN VERY VERY CHALLENGING YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD THE SAME QUESTION AND WE WANTED TO KNOW EVEN WITHIN THAT COUNTY LIKE SAN DIEGO. WHERE WE HAD? ACTIVE OUTBREAK THERE WERE NOT REALLY VERY GOOD ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WHERE HOMELESS. SO SAN DIEGO COUNTY ACTUALLY HAD TO DO VERY ACTIVE. COUNTING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS TO GET A BETTER ESTIMATE BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THAT ACROSS THE STATE THERE'S REALLY NOT A VERY GOOD PLACE WHERE ONE CAN GO. BY AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE HOMELESS OUT THERE. THE HAVING SAID THAT I THINK THAT IN MANY INSTANCES LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY TO QUANTIFY IN THERE ON JURISDICTIONS. YOU KNOW WHO IS HOMELESS ARE AND THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF HELPING TO DISTRIBUTE VACCINE THE VACCINE WAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE. GREAT. BOB WITH THAT IF I CAN WILL MOVE ON TO THE STD QUESTIONS AND THEN WILL INVOLVE PUBLIC COMMENT AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'LL HAVE TO THINK IT. THANK YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ON A. TOPIC OF GREAT FOCUS FOR ME AND THAT IS THE INCREASE IN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. UNLIKE GIL I'M NOT GONNA READ YOUR QUESTIONS TO YOU BUT I'LL ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS IN THAT. CONTEXT TWO TWENTY SIXTEEN CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION DATA SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA HOW THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES OF ALL THREE REPORTABLE BACTERIAL SEXUALLY SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. CHLAMYDIA GONORRHEA AND SYPHILIS INCLUDING THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES. IN OUR PRELIMINARY CALIFORNIA DATA FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHOWS CONTINUED INCREASE IN EACH OF THESE. SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN EARLY SYPHILIS CASES REPORTED IN THE STATE A TWENTY PERCENT INCREASE OVER TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND DOUBLE THE NUMBER FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN. EARLY SURPLUSES AS YOU KNOW THE INFECTIOUS STAGE OF SYPHILIS AND MOST DIRECTLY. REFLECTS THE ONGOING SYPHILIS TRANSMISSION IN COMMUNITIES. THE CASES ARE PREDOMINANTLY MALE AND MOST OF THEM ARE MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN. OVER HALF ARE ALSO HIV POSITIVE. HOWEVER FEMALE CASES HAVE ALSO INCREASED FOURFOLD SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH A VERY CONCERNING RISING CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. THE NUMBER OF INFANTS BORN WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN INCREASE FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT CONGENITAL KIT THAT SYPHILIS CASES WERE REPORTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS A THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE OVER TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND THERE WERE AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY CONGENITAL SYPHILIS ASSOCIATED STILLBIRTHS. NEARLY THREE TIMES THE NUMBER REPORTED IN THE PRECEDING YEAR. WE'VE NOT SEEN THIS MANY CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES IN OVER TWENTY YEARS. TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALSO SAW THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF GONORRHEA CASES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE CASES OF GONORRHEA WERE REPORTED AN INCREASE OF SEVENTEEN PERCENT OVER TWENTY SIXTEEN AND NEARLY DOUBLE TWENTY THIRTEEN. FINALLY AS ONE WOULD EXPECT THE NUMBER OF CHLAMYDIA CASES HAS ALSO INCREASED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER WAS UP ABOUT TEN PERCENT OVER TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THIRTY PERCENT OVER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE REPORTED CHLAMYDIA CASES THIS WAS THE UP IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT'S WAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE REPORTING BEGAN IN NINETEEN NINETY. THE RATE OF CHLAMYDIA WAS AS HAD HAS BEEN HIGHEST AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG WOMEN. IMPORTANT DISPARITIES PERSISTENT STDS WITH THE HIGHEST RATES AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AFRICAN AMERICANS AND GAY BISEXUAL AND OTHER MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN. THESE POPULATIONS ARE AT HIGHER RISK ALSO FOR OTHER SERIOUS OUTCOMES INCLUDING HIV INFECTION. INFERTILITY SYPHILIS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND MULTI DRUG RESISTANT GONORRHEA. IN LARGE PART THESE INCREASES IN STDS ARE BEING DRIVEN BY BROAD SOCIAL FACTORS. INCLUDING INCREASED RATES OF SUBSTANCE USE THE EXCHANGE OF SEX FOR THINGS SUCH AS MONEY HOUSING AND OTHER RESOURCES. GREATER EASE AND MEETING SEX PARTNERS THROUGH MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN SEXUAL BEHAVIORS. INTERVIEWS WITH MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN DIAGNOSED WITH SYPHILIS HAVE REVEALED INCREASES IN THE USE OF INTERNET AND INTRANET APPLICATIONS TO MEET FOR A ANONYMOUS SEX PARTNERS. AMONG WOMEN SYPHILIS IT. HAS BEEN THERE'S BEEN A SHARP INCREASE IN METHAMPHETAMINE USE. IN FACT THE RISK PROFILE FOR STD CASES AMONG HETEROSEXUALS PARTICULARLY WOMEN. CLOSELY MIRRORS WHAT WE USE TO SEE DURING THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC OF THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETEEN NINETIES. THE SAME SOCIAL FACTORS OBVIOUSLY PRESENT SIGNIFICANT NEW CHALLENGES TO STD CONTROL EFFORTS. AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL INCLUDING STD CONTROL HAS ERODED. CITY PH IN OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION PARTNERS ARE PURSUING A NUMBER OF AVENUES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. CITY PITCH CONTINUES OUR SURVEILLANCE FOR STDS STATEWIDE AND PROVIDES DATA TO INFORM DISEASE CONTROL ACTIVITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE ALSO PROMOTE STD AWARENESS EDUCATION TESTING TREATMENT AND OTHER STRATEGIES TO PREVENT DISEASE. AND WE PROVIDE GUIDANCE LEADERSHIP TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES TO ENGAGE PARTNERS AND BUILD CAPACITY FOR DISEASE CONTROL. THE CITY PITCH DISTRIBUTES ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO THE TWENTY EIGHT LOCAL CULTURES TO ACTIONS WITH THE GREATEST STD BURDEN. THESE FUNDS PROVIDE THE COURSE SUPPORT FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL ACTIVITIES FOR OF SURVEILLANCE DISEASE INTERVENTION HEALTH PROMOTION AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT. AND AS YOU KNOW IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION OF LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS. PRESTI DE CONTROL OVER THREE YEARS WAS MADE TO SEE P. H. WE'RE DISTRIBUTING THESE FUNDS TO FORTY LOCAL CULTURE STE ACTIONS WITH THE GREATEST STD BURDEN OVER ABOUT THREE YEAR TIME LINE. AND THE REMAINING HEALTH TO JURISDICTIONS CAN ALSO REQUEST AND WILL RECEIVE SUPPLIES SUCH AS TEST KITS LABORATORY REAGENTS HEALTH EDUCATION MATERIALS AT SAUDARA. THE SPENDING'S BEEN VERY VALUABLE TO LOCAL STD PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAMS BUT THE GREATEST NEED EXPRESSED BY LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION IS FOR ONGOING STAFFING TO GET OUT DISEASE MONITORING INTERVENTION. INCLUDING CASE INTERVIEWS CONTACT TRACING A PARTNER SERVICES. UNFORTUNATELY SOME JURISDICTIONS WERE NOT ABLE TO CREATE PERMANENT FOR. POSITIONS USING ONE TIME FUNDING. IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A STD CONTROL AND PREVENTION. IN FACT IF ACTIVELY CONTROLLING STDS REQUIRES A FLEXIBLE SKILLED LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORSE WORKFORCE. WHICH ALSO PROVIDES THE BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL INCLUDING ADDRESSING EMERGING THREATS AND DISEASE OUTBREAKS. HOWEVER THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY IN OUR SMALL RURAL JURISDICTIONS. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING INCREASES IN STDS. MANY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT STOPPING LOSSES BEGINNING WITH BUDGET DECREASES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DURING THE RECESSION. DESPITE RAISING RISING CASELOADS BY TWENTY THIRTEEN THE MAJORITY OF HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS NOT JUST THE SMALLEST JURISDICTIONS REPORTED FEWER THAN THREE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STAFF DEVOTED TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED. TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES CONTROL. BY TWENTY SIXTEEN LOCAL DEPARTMENT STOCK WERE EXPECTED TO MANAGE OF SYPHILIS CASE RATE THAT HAD DOUBLED. IN THE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL STOCK. BECAUSE OF THIS SOME LOCAL HAVE JURISDICTIONS ARE CHALLENGED IN COMPLETING THE MOST ESSENTIAL DISEASE INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES. WHICH FOR SYPHILIS FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDE TREATMENT VERIFICATION MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. PARTNER SERVICES LINKAGES TO HIV TESTING AND LINKAGE TO HIV CARE OR PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SYPHILIS CASES WITH RECENT INFECTION AND THIRTY NINE PERCENT WITH EARLY OF EARLY LATENT CASES WERE NOT INTERVIEWED FOR PARTNERSHIP MRS. THE SERVICE THESE THIS MEANS THAT OF THESE SERVICES ARE THE MEANS BY WHICH WE IDENTIFY AND TREAT ADDITIONAL CASES OF SYPHILIS AND INTERRUPT IZZY'S TRANSMISSION. AND ALTHOUGH LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS ALWAYS PRIORITIZE FOLLOW UP OF PREGNANT FEMALES WITH SYPHILIS. OVER SEVENTY PREGNANT WOMEN WITH SYPHILIS DID NOT RECEIVE PARTNER SERVICES INTERVIEWS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. ALSO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AMONG EARLY SO ALL EARLY SYPHILIS CASES WHOSE HIV STATUS WAS NEGATIVE ERA KNOWN. ONLY FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT WERE DOCUMENTED TO HAVE RECEIVED AN HIV TEST IN THE THIRTY DAYS FOLLOWING SYPHILIS DIAGNOSIS. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE THESE ARE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERRUPT YOUR DISEASE TRANSMISSION NOT JUST FOR SYPHILIS. AND CONGENITAL SYPHILIS BUT ALSO FOR EACH AB. IN RECENT YEARS AS THE MAJORITY OF STD CLINICS HAVE CLOSE SPECIALTY STD CLINICS RESPONSIBILITY FOR TREATMENT. HAS SHIFTED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. UNFORTUNATELY MOST CLINICIANS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE OR NO TRAINING IN THE APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF STDS. TWENTY SIXTEEN SURVEILLANCE DATA PERSEPOLIS SHOWS THAT TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE WITH A NEW SYPHILIS DIAGNOSIS DID NOT RECEIVE TREATMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE CDC'S STD TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IT PUTS THESE WOMEN AT RISK OF COMPLICATIONS FOR SYPHILIS INCLUDING THE INCREASED RISK FOR CONGENITAL SYPHILIS SHOULD THEY BECOME PREGNANT WHILE INFECTED. IN THE MIDST OF THE CONCERNING HOWEVER THERE IS GOOD NEWS OUT THERE ARE EVIDENCE BASED COST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE KNOW WILL REDUCE STDS AND THERE HAVE BEEN SUCCESS STORIES FROM UP ABOVE JURISDICTION. LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE. BECAUSE OF CONCERNS REGARDING MISSING OR INADEQUATE TREATMENT OF STDS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THREE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS UNDERTOOK A TARGETED EVALUATION PRO PROJECT AIMED AT IMPROVING GONORRHEA TREATMENT. THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CONTACTED NINETY THREE PROVIDERS. PROVIDED EDUCATION AND INFORMATION ABOUT GONORRHEA REPORTING IN TREATMENT. THE PROPORTIONATE PROVIDERS ORDERING CDC RECOMMENDED TREATMENT ROSE FROM FIFTY TWO PERCENT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERVENTION. A SIMILAR PROVIDER BASED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT IS UNDER WAY FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ENHANCE CIVIL A SCREENING ENTRANCE TREATMENT OF PREGNANT WOMEN. AND WHILE THESE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THEM A SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE. I'LL ASSIST IMPLEMENTATION UP. TARGETED SCREENING AT RISK PUT BUMPER POPULATIONS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. TWELVE COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING SUPPLEMENTAL FEDERAL FUNDING FOR JUVENILE HALL CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA SO. SCREENING PROGRAMS. TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA FROM THESE CORRECTIONAL SCREENING SITE SHOW THAT TWELVE PERCENT OF PERSONS SCREAMED HAVE CREPT CHLAMYDIA INFECTION. AND FOUR PERCENT HAVE GONORRHEA WITH THIS HIGH LEVEL OF INFECTION STD CASE BINDING IN THESE VENUES IS HIGHLY EFFICIENT. SIMILAR INCREASES IN OFFICIAL IN INEFFICIENT CASE FINDING HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED WITH TARGETED SYPHILIS SCREENING OF WOMEN IN JAILS IN LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF FEMALE AND CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES. PARTNER SERVICES WHICH WE OF IN OTHER DISEASES CALL. CONTACT TRACING HAS BEEN A STANDARD PRACTICE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL PROGRAMS NATIONWIDE AND ISRAEL RECOMMENDED BY THE CDC. AS AN EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY TO REDUCE STD AND HIV TRANSMISSION AND ASSOCIATED MORBIDITY. PARTNER NOTIFICATION IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF PARTNER SERVICES AND IS INTENDED TO IDENTIFY LOCATE AND INFORM PEOPLE OF THEIR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO INFECTIONS. AND REFER THEM INTO CARE THEREBY PROVIDING TREATMENT AND BREAKING THE CHAIN OF TRANSMISSION. PARTNER SERVICES AND NOT ONLY AFFECTED FOR SYPHILIS IT'S ALSO A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO ARE UNAWARE OF THEIR HIV STATUS CREATING AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO RESIST REDUCE THE RESERVOIR UNDETECTED HIV. BY PROVIDING ON OPPORTUNITY FOR TESTING LINKING TO TREATMENT LINKING UP AT RISK HIV NEGATIVE. THE POSITIVE PERSONS TO TO EXPERT TREATMENT. TRIGGER PREVENTS THE SPREAD OF STDS AND REDUCES THE ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF THEM. BOB EXPEDITED PARTNER TREATMENT OF SEX PARTNERS OF OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH STDS. IS A PROVISION OF TREATMENT TO THE PATIENT TO PROVIDE TO THEIR PARTNER WITHOUT THAT PARTNER REQUIRING A HEALTH CARE IT PROVIDER EXAMINATION BEFORE. PARTNER. EXAMINATION BY CLINICIAN IS OFTEN NOT FEASIBLE FOR MANY REASONS AND EXPEDITED PARTNER TREATMENT OVERCOMES THOSE BARRIERS TO PARTNER TREATMENT AND REDUCES REINFECTION. OF THE ORIGINAL PERSON AS WELL AS DISEASE TRANSMISSION TO OTHERS. SOCIAL MARKETING SAVANNAH IS A VITAL STRATEGY TO ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS OF AS A EXCUSE ME BEHAVIORAL DRIVERS OF STD INCREASES. SOCIAL MARKETING BOOSTS UPTAKE OF SERVICES AND ESTABLISHES SOCIAL NORMS THAT SUPPORT HEALTHY BEHAVIORS. WITH THE CURRENT ONE TIME FUNDING THREE YEAR LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING INCREASED LOCAL TO HELP JURISDICTIONS HAVE BOOSTED THEIR HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES BY PARTNERING WITH MEDICAL PROVIDERS MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH. PROGRAM PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND TESTING ON PREGNANT WOMEN. THE OTHER ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO FURTHER INTEGRATE STD AND HIV HEALTH COMMUNICATION MESSAGING IS UNDER WAY WITH DEVELOPMENT OF STAKEHOLDER INFORMED STD ITCH AB MESSAGING FOR MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN. AND INTEGRATED STD HIV PROVIDER DETAILING IE DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION. I'M TO ENHANCE THAT PROVIDER AWARENESS OF SCREENING AND TREATMENT GUIDELINES AND FOR HIV PROP. PROVIDERS ADDITIONALLY IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL BASED PARTNERS. SUPPORT CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT HAS BEEN A FOCUS OF A NUMBER OF LOCAL CULTURES TO ACTIONS AS ANOTHER WAY TO PREVENT STDS AMONG YOUTH. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION AS WELL I'M IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ENSURE THAT EVIDENCE BASED STD PRACTICES LIKE RISK BASED TESTING TREATMENT AND MORE USE AND GREATER USE OF EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY ARE CONSIDERATIONS IN POLICY DECISIONS. WHEN WE WERE. MAKING POLICY RELATED TO THE CONTINUING EVOLUTION OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. HOWEVER THE INCREASE IN STDS IS PREDOMINANTLY BEING DRIVEN BY SOCIAL TREND. WHEN WE NEED TO INNOVATE WE NEED INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND DELIVER STD SERVICES IN SETTINGS FREQUENTED BY THE PEOPLE MOST AT RISK. THIS SORT OF INNOVATION REQUIRES COORDINATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE PARTNERS AND. PROGRAMS AND SEE BEACH IS ACTIVELY WORKING TO IDENTIFY THE MOST EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS FOR STD CONTROL AS WE MOVE. INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THIS CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY NOT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU DOCTOR SMITH. BUT WE HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE UNDER THE AGENDA. I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU THOSE HOPING YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT BEFORE. WE MOVE ON TO THE LA. FOLLOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND. YOU NO AS ALL PROPOSALS ARE CONSIDERED. WITHIN THE BROADER BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK. THEIR OFTEN DIFFICULT DECISIONS WITH TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT A GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. WELL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY NEW PROPOSALS FOR A CITY. PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE THERE IS TWELVE MILLION AND WITHIN THE PARK DEPART PUBLIC HEALTH TO AND. TO ADDRESS THE CITY PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. BUT IN LIGHT OF. THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA SPENDING NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS IN TREATMENT OF STDS. WOULDN'T IT A IMPROVE. OUR ABILITY TO HELP TO PREVENT DISEASE IF WE WOULD SPEND MORE ON PREVENTION RATHER THAN TREATMENT. AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BROADER BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK. KELLY O. ANY COMMENTS. I WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE EIGHT. YEAH MY NAME IS DAVID KILBURN I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ACCESS SUPPORT NETWORK OF SAN LUIS OBISPO AND MONTEREY COUNTIES. I'D LIKE TO JUST QUICKLY ADDRESS QUICK'S. SCENARIO OF HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK. WHILE MONTEREY COUNTY WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE TO WHILE THE GOVERNOR HAD. DIRECTED THOSE TYPE IMPACT COUNTIES WE ACTUALLY ARE AIDS SERVICE ORGANIZATION HEPATITIS C. SERVICES. PARTNERED WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND MONTEREY COUNTY AND PLANNED A ACTION PLAN AROUND HOW WE WOULD. BOB GET THOSE VACCINES OUT WE HAVE A SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM AND DO DIRECT OUTREACH TO THE HOMES POPULATIONS WHAT WE DID IS WE PLANNED. A COURSE OF ACTION WIN THOSE FUNDS WHEN THOSE VACCINES WOULD EVER BECOME AVAILABLE. OF MEDIATE LEE WHEN WE ARE CONTACT IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE WE WERE ABLE TO PARTNER. WITH PUBLIC HEALTH GET THOSE VACCINES DIRECTLY INTO THE FIELD IMMEDIATELY SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE OUR COUNTIES TO ENCOURAGE SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THEIR AREAS. TO DO SIMILAR THINGS WE HAD THE TRUST OF THE PARTICIPANTS AT MOST RISK WE'RE ABLE TO BRING NURSES IN FOR VACCINES ON SITE IN OUR STRATEGIC CHANGE PROGRAM AND GET. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE VACCINATED SOAP. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT OF BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS. I DID HAVE. I WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PILOT IN THE JUVENILE HALLS AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SINCE WE OF RECOGNIZE THE BENEFIT. TO SCALING THAT PROGRAM AND WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ABOUT. HOW WE CAN HELP TO PRIORITIZE TESTING PRIOR TO DISCHARGE FROM JUVENILE HALL SAYS IT SEEMS THAT? A FAIR AMOUNT ARE TRANSITORY HOW CAN WE HELP TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TESTING THAT IS OCCURRING IN OUR JUVENILE HALLS SO THAT WE CAN HELP TO CATCH IT SOONER. YOU KNOW THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND GOES BACK TO THE VERY SAME ISSUE OF LOCAL CAPACITY. HIGH YOU KNOW OUR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND WE MEET WITH THEM REGULARLY KNOW THAT THAT THAT WORKING WITH GILES REALLY WORKS AND THEY WANT TO DO THIS ON IT IS AN ISSUE OF THIS THEM NOT HAVING ENOUGH CAPACITY AND THE PERSONNEL. HOW TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL JAILS IN SETTING UP SCREENING PROGRAMS DOES NOT HAVE DONE IT TOUGH ON THE TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE? SO IS ONE OF THOSE SORT OF LONG HANGING FRUITS THAT WITHOUT SOME RESOURCES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL COULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. AND IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT THE ONE TIME FUNDING DID NOT CREATE THE ABILITY TO. CREATE THOSE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND LATER IN THIS AGENDAWE WILL HEAR FROM ONGOING. PROPOSAL THAT WILL PROVIDE A SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT MAY ALLOW US TO GET TO THAT PLACE. BUT I DO FEEL THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE AN OBLIGATION IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT. CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IS AT A TWENTY YEAR HIGH THAT COMMITTEE AS THE MOST SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. THAT NOW IS THE TIME FOR US AS A STATE TO BE APPROPRIATELY INVESTING. TO ATTEMPT TO HELP TO PREVENT DISEASE. I'M HAVING BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES HAVING WORKED IN AN AREA THAT WAS QUITE A BIT OF A HOT SPOT. I HAVE SEEN THOSE CASES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND. THE. INFANT MORTALITY THAT COMES WITH IT. AND REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO TRY AND GET AHEAD OF. I HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE THANK YOU DOCTOR SPENDING FOR COME THANK YOU. ALSO DOCTOR ARAMBULA I THINK ON THE AGENDA THERE WAS A REQUEST THAT WE GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE FUNDING YOU GAVE US. THROUGH STAKEHOLDER AUGMENTATIONS THAT YOU WON TO THOUGH THAT BEFORE WE PROCEED. THAT IS UP TO YOU WE I HAVE A DOCTOR HEIDI BAUER WHO IS OUR IS TO THE CHIEF HERE WITH ME TO THE WITH THAT ON THE IS TO THE PROPOSAL CONDUCTOR MARK. ON THE HIV PROPOSALS THE VALUE IF IT'S OKAY MAYBE WILL HAVE A MEETING AFTER THIS MARKET THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M GOING TO WANTS TO CONTINUE TO DIG INTO AND. BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS MEETING IF WE MOVE ON TO SHORT AND THAT BE CRAP THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. BELIEVING. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TIMOTHY BILL I'M WITH THE ADMINISTRATION DIVISION FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND BEFORE YOU IS A CAPITAL OUTLAY BUDGET PROPOSAL. WHICH WILL REVERT THREE POINT SEVEN NINE NINE MILLION. OF OUR EXISTING AUTHORITY AND A REQUEST FOR FOUR POINT EIGHT SIX SIX MILLION. FOR TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION PORTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH BIO SAFETY LEVEL THREE LABORATORY. THIS REQUEST IS A NET INCREASE OF ONE POINT ZERO SIX SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THIS INCREASE APPROPRIATIONS NECESSARY DUE TO THE DELAYS AND INCREASED COSTS THAT WERE BEYOND. THAT DEPARTMENTS OR DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES CONTROL. TO GIVE YOU A QUICK BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT. BE KEPT THE PUBLIC HEALTH RICHMAN LABORATORY CAMPUS WAS CONSTRUCTED IN TWO THOUSAND. AND WITHIN THE LABORATORY CAMPUS AS THE VIRAL RICK SILLIEST DISEASE LABORATORY APPROACH UP THAT UP BUT I JUST QUALITY RTO. THE VIDEO WAS A BSL THREE CERTIFIED LABORATORY AND USE TO SAMPLE A PATHOGENIC OF VIRUSES. THIS LABORATORY UPGRADE PROJECT STARTED TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN RESPONSE TO VARIOUS WHAT A WAR HEALTH. ISSUES THAT ENHANCE THE BE A SELF THREE REQUIREMENTS. IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE RECEIVED A FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR APPROPRIATION TO FUND THE PRELIMINARY PLANS AND WORKING TRYING PHASES OF THE PROJECT. WE DIDN'T ENGAGE THE SERVICES OF GENERAL SERVICES AND WHICH THEY DEVELOP THE NATIVE PLANTS AND THE WORKING TRUCKS. IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE RECEIVED FOUR POINT THREE THREE MILLION TO FUND THE BED AND CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THE PROJECT. THE. THE SCHEDULE WAS TO. DO THE. OKAY BID PACKAGE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND HE JUST COMPARE PREPARED THEY ARE CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS AND BID PACKAGES. HOWEVER DUE TO THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL SUSPENDED ALL THE PLAN REVIEWS BECAUSE THEY HAD TO DIRECT ALL THE RESOURCES TO COMBAT THE FIRE. ONE. DOES RESULT DIGESTED OUT WAS UNABLE TO GET STUFF STATE FARMERS APPROVAL AND A COMPLETE THE PROJECT OUT THE BIT. IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE CAME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND AND ASK FOR REAPPROPRIATION OF THE REMAINING THREE POINT SEVEN NINE NINE. FUNDS TO CONTINUE THE CONSTRUCTION INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. FINALLY IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HE JUST FINALLY GOT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL APPROVAL. BUT THE PLANS OUT THE BIT IN AUGUST OUT TO THE ON SEVENTEEN. AND THEN IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN D. JUST RECEIVED ONLY ONE BIT FOR THREE POINT FOUR FOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS TWENTY THREE PERCENT OR APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND ABOVE THE TWO POINT SEVEN NINE SIX MILLION DOLLARS A CONSTRUCTION BUDGET. OKAY. SO WE HAD THE JUST REVIEW THE PROJECTS ESTIMATE AND THE BITS THAT WERE RECEIVED. AND DETERMINE THAT THAT ONE BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIALTY TYPE OF SERVICE SOUGHT AT THE LABORATORIES NOT JUST STOP BUILDING CONSTRUCTION NOW ELIMINATE THE COP THE AVAILABLE CLOCK CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS THAT COULD. FIT ON THIS THE SECOND WAS IF YOU LOOK AT THE. CONSTRUCTION MARKET RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY VERY HEALTHY. OF THEM IT'S VERY VERY STRONG IN THE BAY AREA. AND US ALL THAT LIMITED THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING SOME FUND A PROJECT LIKE THIS. THE PROJECT ALSO THE PROJECT ORIGINAL ESTIMATE THAT NECESSARILY GIVE A CALL REFLECT THE CURRENT STRENGTH UP THE UC CONSTRUCTION MARKET THEY USED A THREE PERCENT OF. THE COST INCREASE FACTOR AND IT'S GOT IN THE CONSTRUCTION MARK WAS GROWING AT TEN TO TWELVE PERCENT. SO THEN HE JUST LOOK AT THE BETS AND ARE LOOKED AT THE ONE BIT AND DETERMINED BASED ON WHAT THEY SAW THAT IT IT. ADDED ACT ACCURATELY REFLECTED BEYOND THE CURRENT STRENGTH OF THE CONSTRUCTION MARKET. SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN. THE CURRENT REQUEST INCLUDES THE REVISED THE JUST COST ESTIMATE WHICH WERE ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE UP CURRENT STRENGTH OF THE. OTHER CONSTRUCTION MARKET AND THE SPECIALTY NATURE OF THE UP PROJECT. THE PROJECT REVISED SCHEDULE IS THAT THE JETS ANTICIPATES WHAT YOU APPROVAL WILL GO BACK UP THE BED DOT SOMETIME IN SEPTEMBER. WITH HOPEFULLY CONSTRUCTION TO START IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND IT'S AS CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE BUT TWELVE MONTHS AND SHOULD BE COMPLETE AROUND THE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY. SO IN SUMMARY THE PROJECT DELAYS WERE BEYOND ANYBODY'S CONTROL. THE BSL THREE ENHANCEMENTS ARE STILL WOULD NEED IT SAUL WHO QUESTION APPROVED FOR THIS PROPOSAL WE COMPLETE THE PROJECT. BECAUSE THE V. RTL LABORATORIES A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS MISSION TO PROTECTING THE HEALTH. OF CAL ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLIER WHEN IT COMES. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE NINE. SEEING NONE OF WE WILL HOLD ISSUE NINE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWELFTH PUBLIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND WELCOME. CHAIR MEMBERS RANT MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AGAIN WITH OUR PARTNERS AT ESSENTIAL HEALTH ON ESSENTIAL ACCESS HEALTH WE ARE HERE TO REQUEST OF A TEN MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION TO THEIR. STD PREVENTION AND CONTROL BRANCH SO DO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT DOCTOR SMITH AND DOCTOR CHAVEZ WERE SITTING UP HERE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK OF THE THE TENOR OF THE CONVERSATION IS DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS WHEN WE WERE BEFORE YOU A YEAR AGO. WHICH I I FEEL LIKE YOU YOU HAD TO TO PULL MORE INFORMATION OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT THIS TIME THEY WERE MUCH MORE WILLING TO. TO PRESENT I THINK IT CHANGES ARE CHANGES THE TENOR OF THIS DISCUSSION WANT TO ADD. ONE THING IN TERMS A CONTEXT LIKE. WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT WHAT'S HAPPENING CALIFORNIA THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THIS IS WE ARE ANOTHER CYCLE THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES AND THOSE OF US WHO GREW UP IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE. AND HOW STD RATES WERE OUTRAGEOUSLY. I WASN'T ASKING FOR YOU TO HOOK TO APPLY MISTER. A. SO IN THE IN NINETEEN SIXTY WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF A RISE ON AN STD RATES LOOKING AT GONORRHEA AND PARTICULAR BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN TRACKED OVER. THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS I'M TO THE POINT WHERE WE GOT TO. A RATE THAT IS WAS SO OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH IN SEVENTY NINE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. ON THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY STEPPED UP. AND STARTED DOING THINGS TO BRING VALUE THE STD EPIDEMIC AT THAT POINT UNDER CONTROL TO THE POINT THE BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THEM THAT NINETIES LATE NINETIES WE WERE SEEING NUMBERS BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE IN THE FIFTIES. SOME OF THAT BECAUSE WHAT THE STATE WAS DOING ON SOME OF IT ALSO BECAUSE OF CULTURAL ISSUES ON THE HIV EPIDEMIC. HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR THEIR. THEIR PRACTICES I'M BUT STILL WE MADE AN EFFORT AND WE WERE ABLE TO PICK IT UNDER CONTROL. YOU LOOK AT THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT. THAT CLIMB BEGIN AGAIN ON WE STARTED LOW AND WE'RE NOW BACK UP INTO INTO THREE DIGIT NUMBERS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND WITCHES. AND AND CONTINUING TO GO OUT TO GO OFTEN AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING I'M DRAMATIC TO CHANGE IT. WE APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE BUT ALSO BY PUTTING FIVE MILLION AND LAST YEAR UNFORTUNATE DIDN'T SURVIVE. BUT YOU WILL GET YOU UNDERSTAND AS DOCTOR CHAVEZ SAID AND DOCTOR SMITH SAID EVEN TODAY THAT THE ISSUE WAS MANPOWER'S BITS PEOPLE POWER WE NEED PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WHETHER THEY WORK FOR COUNTIES OR CBO'S. I'M TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE THINGS THAT THINGS STICK. ON THAT WE'RE NOT THROWING KITS AT THEM WHICH IMPORTANT THEY NEED THOSE KITS. FOR FOR TESTING PURPOSES BUT YOU CAN'T STOP WITH THE TEST AND NOT DO THE NEXT THINGS WHICH IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET TREATMENT THAT THEIR PARTNERS GET NOTIFIED THAT THEIR PARTNERS GET TREATMENT. WHEN THEY NEED IT AMEND SO WE DO REALLY INTERRUPT ON INTERRUPT THE CYCLE AYE SO WE WOULD LAWYER I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO AGAIN. WHAT YOU DID LAST YEAR WE'RE ASKING FOR TEN MILLION THIS YEAR THE ISSUE GETS WORSE AND WORSE URINE AND YOU'RE OUT? AND WE REALLY NEED TO PUT A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY AT IT ON TEN MILLION IS A SMALL AMOUNT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A A A BIG START. GOING TO CLOSE WITH ONE LAST POINT THAT THAT WE SOMETIMES LOSE SIGHT OF THAT WE LOOK AT ALL THE DATA. ON AND THAT IS THAT MEDICALLY CLINICALLY ON STDS ARE CHANGING. ENDS I GONORRHEA ESPECIALLY HAS GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE DOWN TO ACCORDING THE CDC ONE. TREATMENT THAT WORKS FOR GONORRHEA EVERYTHING ELSE WE ARE ARE SEEING DRUG RESISTANT. STRAINS OF GONORRHEA THAT ARE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO US. TO TREAT MOM SO WHERE WE'RE CREATING A SITUATION WHERE THE NUMBERS GO UP. IN A DISEASE THAT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNTREATABLE WHICH IF WE GET OVER THAT UNFORTUNATE HUMP ON WILL FIND OURSELVES REALLY AND I'M IN A WORLD OF HURT. I'M NGUYEN COURAGE YOU TO ADOPT THE TEMPLE IN DOLLARS THINK IT. I GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. MY NAME SLAVIC HESTIA I'M HERE REPRESENTING ESSENTIAL ACCESS HEALTH.

COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND PROVIDERS A TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES AN STD PREVENTION AND CASE MANAGEMENT. YOU DON'T THIS IS NO LONGER AN EPIC DEATH IT'S STD EPIDEMIC IF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN BE REACHED THAT CRISIS FOUR YEARS AGO AND SO THIS THIS IS HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS FINDING. TO THAT AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THE HOT SPOTS INNER CITY AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST STD NUMBERS ARE FRESNO. MOVE HERNE BAY AREA COUNTIES RIVERSIDE SAN DINO ORANGE ALLEY MENTAL SCENE NOW AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES. I'M TO THAT END OF BUT IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO A CD CONTROL BRANCH AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT A LITTLE OVER FIVE MILLION OR CLOSE TO SIX MILLION OF THAT. COME STRAIGHT FROM THE CDC THROUGH FEDERAL FUNDING AND THAT FUNDING IS ALSO AT RISK RIGHT NOW WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON DC. THIS LAST YEAR ALONE THE REPUBLICAN LED HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES VOTED IN SUPPORT OF A FEDERAL BUDGET THAT DRASTICALLY CUT THE CDC'S BUDGET FOR STD PREVENTION. SO IF THAT FEDERAL FUNDING IS SLASH CALIFORNIA WILL SUFFER AND THAT SO WE WERE JUST PLEASE URGING YOU TO HEAR THE ALARM BELLS THAT ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN SOUNDING FOR A LONG TIME NOW. AND WE ASK FOR ITS TEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE THINKING. REPUBLICAN MONTH ON ISSUE TWELVE. YEAH HI I'M ROBERT HOFFMAN FROM. SERVICES GREAT FUNDACION SYRINGE ACCESS SERVICES AND WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS ASK. THANK YOU SIR. ARENT FOX LOS ANGELES LGBT CENTER ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HELLO CREEK PULSE FROM THE HALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA HIV ALLIANCE A COALITION OF OVER A DOZEN HIV SERVICE PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND ON THE ON BEHALF OF PROJECT INFORM IN STRONG SUPPORT. THE COMMITTEE. WITH THAT I'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS I THINK. YOU KNOW HOW. STRONGLY I FEEL ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND. LOOK TO MY OTHER MEMBERS IF THEY WERE HERE TODAY. TO ATTEMPT TO MOVE THIS TIME BUT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THAT WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWELVE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTEEN GETTING EATEN AND DEATH THANKS FOR STAYING LATE TONIGHT. MY NAME'S ANDREW REYNOLDS AND I AM THE HEPATITIS C. EDUCATION MANAGER FOR PROJECT INFORM. AND THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA APPETITE ITS ALLIANCE. TELL THAT IS MADE UP OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED HEPATITIS B. HEPATITIS C. ORGANIZATIONS. CLINICS AND PROVIDERS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR REVIEWING OUR REQUEST TODAY. CALIPERS REQUESTING A SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING ANNUAL INVESTMENT AND HEPATITIS C. PREVENTION. TESTING AND LINKAGE TO CARE AND TREATMENT. THIS REQUEST IS AN EXPANSION OF THE TWO POINT TWO MILLION A YEAR DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. THAT WAS FINANCED IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THIS FUNDING COVERS THE TESTING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE A VERY HIGH RISK OF ACQUIRING IN TRANSMITTING HEPATITIS C.. AND WHERE NEEDED SYSTEM NAVIGATION TO HELP PEOPLE CONNECT TO TREATMENT AND CARE. AS WELL AS THE TRAINING OF PHYSICIANS TO TREAT HEPATITIS C. IN THE COMMUNITY. THE DATA COLLECTED AND PUBLISHED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SHOWS THAT THE PILOT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND MERITS EXPANSION. BUT THE FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM ENDS IN JUNE. AND THE NEED IS URGENT. ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL HEPATITIS C. CAUSES MORE DEATHS THAN THE NEXT SIXTY NINE INFECTIOUS DISEASES COMBINED. DISEASES THAT INCLUDE THE FLU TUBERCULOSIS AND HIV. HEPATITIS C. IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF LIVER CANCER AND LIVER TRANSPLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING WITH HEPATITIS C.. AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IT. THAT'S WHERE THE NEED FOR TESTING AND CONNECTION TO TREATMENT COMES AT. WE HAVE OVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND NEW INFECTIONS PER YEAR IN A TEN YEAR PERIOD FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WE HAD MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR HIV RELATED LIVER DISEASE. LIVER CANCER OR LIVER TRANSPLANTS AS A RESULT OF HEPATITIS C.. AND THIS COMES AT A COST OF OVER TWENTY BILLION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS. ANYTHING ABOUT THIS IS ALL THE SUFFERING THE DEATHS AND THE RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEPATITIS C. ARE ABSOLUTELY AFFORDABLE. WE HAVE A CURE. THE CURE IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DURING MORE THAN NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH VERY FEW SIDE EFFECTS. IN AS LITTLE AS EIGHT TO TWELVE WEEKS. TREATING INCURRING HEPATITIS C. IMPROVES A PERSON'S HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. IT'S COST EFFECTIVE. AND LEAST OTHER LONG TERM BENEFITS SUCH AS LESS HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND RE ENTRY TO THE WORK FORCE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CURED. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EACH CVS COMMUNICABLE AND FOR EACH PERSON WE CURE WE PREVENT OTHER PEOPLE FROM EVER BEING INFECTED. SIX POINT SIX MILLION IS A LOGICAL INCREMENTAL EXPANSION OF A SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. IN ITS COMPLEMENTARY OF INVESTMENTS BY HEALTH INSURERS AND OTHER PROGRAMS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVED INCAPABLE OF PRIORITIZING THE ERADICATION OF THIS COMMUNICABLE DISEASE THAT CAUSES THE MOST DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES. SO IT'S UP TO THE STATES TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND TAKE THE. AND TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU SIR.

HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ONTO ISSUE FOURTEEN. THANKS THANK YOU DOCTOR MARK. GOOD AFTERNOON. AND THAT YOU CAN MARK TO FOR THE F. CITY IT'S AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HOLLOW OUT MANY THANKS TO THE ASSEMBLY STAFF FOR PREPARING THIS WONDERFUL SUMMARY. I'D LIKE TO START OUT BY PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIANS LAYING A FOUNDATION FOR GETTING TO ZERO PLAN AND THEN OUT GO AHEAD AND PRESENT A SUMMARY OF THE EIGHT UP ESTIMATE. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER BEADS RELEASED THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE LAYING A FOUNDATION FOR GETTING TO ZERO PLAN IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE PLAN IS A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN STATE LOCAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS ANCEPS FOURTH CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENTS A COLLABORATION. EFFICIENCY AND INNOVATION IN ORDER TO MEET OR EXCEED NATIONAL HIV AIDS STRATEGY PREVENTION CARE AND TREATMENT GOALS. THE PLAN PROVIDES A VISION AND FOUNDATION FOR EVENTUALLY GETTING TO ZERO IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WE DEFINE ZERO NEW HIV INFECTIONS ZERO AIDS RELATED DEATHS. AND ZERO STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE WITH HIV. AND DEVELOPING THE PLAN WE TOOK AN OVERALL APPROACH OF VISION AND POSSIBILITY. WE SET OUT TO DEVELOP CHALLENGING BUT POTENTIALLY ACHIEVABLE OBJECTIVES. OUR GOAL WAS TO DEVELOP BROAD SUPPORT FOR THESE ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING ALLSTATE PARTNERS SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. COVER CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH OVERSEES SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS. WE ALSO WHEN IT'S DEVELOP BROAD SUPPORT FOR THE PLAN FROM ALL LOCAL PUBLIC CULT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THE PLAN SETS OUT FOR GOALS TO REDUCE NEW HIV INFECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV. PRODUCE HIV RELATED DISPARITIES AND HEALTH INEQUITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND TO ACHIEVE A MORE COORDINATED STATE RIGHT RESPONSE TO THE HIV EPIDEMIC. A PLAN SET TWELVE OBJECTIVES TO MONITOR CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS TOWARDS THESE GOALS SINCE THE PLAN WAS RELEASED CALIFORNIA SENATE SEEN IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL OF THESE OBJECTIVES. THE PROPORTION OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV WHO HAVE NO DETECTABLE VIRUS IN THEIR BLOOD MEANING THAT THEY WILL STAY HEALTHY AND THAT THEY CAN'T TRANSMIT HIV TO OTHERS. INCREASED FROM FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT TO SIXTY ONE PERCENT WHICH IS ON TRACK TO MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOAL OF EIGHTY PERCENT. ADDITIONALLY THE PROPORTION OF EIGHT OUT CLIENTS WITH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCREASE FROM FIFTY THREE PERCENT TO FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT. ON MAY THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE OFFICE OF AIDS WILL CONVENE A STAKEHOLDER MEETING TO PROVIDE UPDATES ON PROGRESS. TOWARD PLAN GOALS AND TO SEEK INPUT FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON AREAS IN WHICH WE'VE MADE LESS PROGRESS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS MEETING THE OFFICE OF AIDS WILL RELEASE A BASELINE REPORT WHICH WILL PROVIDE UPDATED BASELINE MEASURES AND ANNUAL TARGETS FOR EACH OBJECTIVE. AND WILL PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE ACTIVITIES THAT TAKEN PLACE. DURING HIS FORMATIVE PERIOD WE'VE CONVENED INITIAL MEETINGS WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES COVERED CALIFORNIA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ADDITIONALLY EACH BRANCH WITHIN THE OFFICE OF AIDS AS BEGUN TO MODIFY PROGRAM'S GUIDANCE AND FUNDING TO ALIGN WITH THE GOALS AND. OBJECTIVES A PLAN AND TO COMMUNICATE THESE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR CONTRACTORS AND PARTNERS. THE REPORT ALSO HAS A SUMMARY OF NEXT STEPS PLAN TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESS TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES STATED IN THE PLAN AND ORDERED TO BRING US CLOSER TO GETTING TO ZERO. I AM I CAN NOW GO AHEAD AND GIVE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE ADA ESTIMATES. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED EIGHT UP LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION WITH NEW STATE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. THE REVISED FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET IS THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION MAINLY DUE TO A ONE TIME NEED FOR SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS TO CD PEACHES. INSURANCE AND MEDICAL BENEFITS MANAGER PLATFORM TO IMPLEMENT THE PURPOSES PROGRAM AND TO ACCOMMODATE THE EXPANSION OF INSURANCE. A PREMIUM BENEFITS TO INDIVIDUALS WITH EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE AND MEDICARE PART D.. IN ADDITION TO OTHER ELIGIBILITY ENHANCEMENTS TO STREAMLINE INSURANCE DATA TRANSFERS AND MEDICAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS CLAIM SUBMISSIONS. AND FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WE PROPOSE A UP LOCAL STUDENTS FUNDING THAT PROPOSED IT UP LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING IS FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION. WE ESTIMATE THAT EXPENDITURES WILL INCREASE BY THIRTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT. THIRTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION INCREASE COMPARED WITH THE REVISED FISCAL YEAR. I CURRENT YEAR ESTIMATE. WE EXPECTED THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLIENTS RECEIVING AID UP SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE EACH YEAR AT RATES SIMILAR TO PRE ACA IMPLEMENTATION. DUE TO PEOPLE BECOMING NEWLY INFECTED WITH HIV AND THEN ADDITIONALLY MEDICAL MEDICATION PRICES INCREASE ANNUALLY. WE ALSO ESTIMATED DECREASE IN MEDICATION ONLY CLIENTS DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EIGHT OUT ACCESS ADHERENCE AND NAVIGATION PROGRAM. AND THEREBY LOWERING PROGRAM COSTS AS MEDICATION ONLY CLIENTS TRANSITION TO PRIVATE INSURANCE. THERE IS ONE NEW EIGHT OUT POLICY CHANGE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET THE NEW POLICY CHANGE RELATES TO FUNDING FOR IT UP ENROLLMENT SITES. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED A ONE TIME LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION FOR AN ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION FOR PAYMENT TO ENROLLMENT SITES. FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. BECAUSE TASK PERFORMED BY EIGHT UP ENROLLMENT WORKERS HAVE GROWN IN BOTH SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. CITY PEACH PROPOSES STARTING IN FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MOVING TO A MODEL IN WHICH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS FOR A HAPPEN ROMAN SERVICES PERFORMANCE. IS ADJUSTED ANNUALLY THROUGH THE ESTIMATES PROCESS BASED ON CASELOAD AN ESTIMATEDSERVICES TO BE PERFORMED EACH FISCAL YEAR. SO FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WE PROJECT ENROLLMENT COSTS OF SEVEN POINT NINE NINE MILLION. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THIS ONGOING INCREASE IN FUNDING TO EAT UP ENROLLMENT SITES RESULTS IN IMPROVED CLIENT HEALTH OUTCOMES AND COST NEUTRALITY. WE PLAN TO INCLUDE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AN EXISTING AID APPAN MOMENTS AT CONTRACTS TO ENSURE ENROLLMENT SITES USE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO TRANSITION AN INCREASED NUMBER OF MEDICATION ONLY CLIENTS TO PRIVATE INSURANCE. AND THE OFFICE OF AIDS HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM PAYMENT PROGRAM EONS TO MEET DEFINED METRICS SUCH AS IMPROVEMENT AND VIRAL SUPPRESSION RATES IN EACH ENROLLMENT SITE. WHICH IS REALLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR GETTING TO ZERO PLAN. AS ALWAYS THE NUMBERS AN ESTIMATE WILL BE REVISED WITH UPDATED INFORMATION DURING THE MAY REVISION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA ONLY COMMENTS. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE FOURTEEN. SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT BACK UP THE DYESS AND HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIFTY. BANKS. AND SO THAT IT UP ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL REQUESTS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND EIGHT APP REBATE FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY TO SUPPORT TO ADMINISTRATIVELY ESTABLISHED POSITIONS. IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION AND EAT UP REBATE FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY. AND FIFTEEN PERMIT POSITIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AN ON GOING TO MANAGE THE INCREASED WORKLOAD INVOLVED IN TRANSITIONING EIGHT APP ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT SERVICES TO THE CITY PEACH OFFICE OF AIDS. THESE POSITIONS WOULD INCLUDE ELEVEN POSITIONS FOR THE IT UP CALLING DATA PROCESSING CENTER TWO POSITIONS TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR ALL EAT AT DETER RELATED ACTIVITIES. ONE POSITION TO OVERSEE AND MAINTAIN THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR THE ENROLLMENT SYSTEM AND ONE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION. WE BELIEVE THAT APPROVAL OF THE SPECIES P. WILL ENABLE US TO CONTINUE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE TO EAT AT THE MOMENT WORKERS AND CLIENTS. SINCE WE TOOK IT UP ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT SERVICES AND HOUSE ONE YEAR AGO. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA ONLY COMES. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE FIFTEEN. SINAN. I'M. SUPPORTIVE OF BRINGING IN AND HOW SOME QUESTIONING HAS THERE BEEN AN ANALYSIS. COMPARING. THE DIFFERENCE AND. THE ORIGINAL SINGULAR. COMPANY THAT WAS DOING IT AND HOW WE'VE BROKEN IT UP IN TERMS OF IF WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD AN OVERALL INCREASING COSTS. BECAUSE OF. DIVERSIFYING IN ADDING THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS TO DO THE PARTS OF THE AT PROGRAM. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AN ANALYSIS HAD TO SEE IF. I WERE BEING COST EFFICIENT. WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES BECAUSE I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OCCURRED IS THAT WE IMPLEMENTED THE PAYMENT OF MEDICAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR OUR OFFICE NEEDS HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM PAYMENT PROGRAM CLIENTS. AND THAT INVOLVED AND NECESSITY DOES GETTING UP THIRD CONTRACTOR THE EIGHT OUT MEDICAL AND INSURANCE BENEFITS MANAGER AND THAT BOTH APPEASE THE INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND HAPPY AS A MEDICAL AYE POCKET COSTS. I'M SO THAT WAS NECESSITATED BY BY TOM. AUGMENTATIONS WE GOT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO TO MAKE THAT SERVICE AVAILABLE TO OUR CLIENTS I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT INFORMATION INTO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN. NO BOND ISSUE SIXTEEN. THANK YOU I COULD AFTERNOON CREEK PULSE FOR FROM IT KILL A HEALTH AND LOS ANGELES AND CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA HIV ALLIANCE. POP AND I AM QUITE A MULTI PERSON I'M THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND STRATEGY FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION AND THE OTHER CO CHAIR OF THIS. ATV ALLIANCE AND THAT BEFORE WE GET STARTED ON THE COMMAND THE OFFICE OF BATES FOR THE AMOUNT WORK THEY'VE DONE IN THE LATE THE FOUNDATION PLAN. AND WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT. ALSO I MEAN I THINK AS ADVOCATES WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT'S CALIFORNIA'S FALLING BEHIND OTHER STATES THAT HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN HIV PROGRAM SO. NEW YORK STATE FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN SIDE NEW HIV INFECTIONS FALL BY. THIRTY TWO PERCENT COMPARED CALIFORNIA FALLING BY THREE PERCENT. OVER THAT SAME TIME PERIOD SO WE BROUGHT FOR THE NUMBER PROPOSALS TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T CONTINUE FALLING BEHIND. I'M I'M GONNA PRESENT THREE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT HOW TO INCREASE. TAKE A PROP AND OTHER HIV PREVENTION SERVICES AS YOU KNOW PREPOSITIONED VERY EFFECTIVE HIV PREVENTION INTERVENTION UP TO NINETY NINE PERCENT EFFECTIVE. AT PREVENTING ACQUISITION OF HIV. BUT CALIFORNIA HIV AIDS RESEARCH PROGRAM RECENTLY PUT OUT SOME DATA LOOKING AT PREP UPTAKE IN THE STATE'S MEDI CAL PROGRAM. AND FOUND THAT FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT INCREASED FROM LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED TO OVER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING PERHAPS SO THAT'S CERTAINLY A VERY GOOD IMPROVEMENT WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT IT'S FAR BELOW THE STATE'S GOAL OF HAVING SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. ON PREP BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SOMETHING ELSE I THINK THAT WAS VERY CONCERNING ABOUT THAT DATA WAS THE UPTAKE WAS LOWER AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS YOUTH AND WOMEN. AS YOU KNOW HIV DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS THOSE FOLKS OF HIV RATE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS IS FOUR TIMES THAT OF WHITES AND AMONG LATINOS IS ONE HALF TIMES THAT OF WHITES AND SO. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED UNLESS WE MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT THOSE DISPARITIES ARE ONLY GOING TO BE EXACERBATED. SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL AS TEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN CBO'S TO PROVIDE HIV PREVENTION SERVICES INCLUDING PREP AND HIV TESTING. I THINK SIGNIFICANTLY WE DON'T HAVE A RELIABLE ADEQUATE FUNDING SOURCE ESPECIALLY FOR PREP PROGRAM SO THE CDC. HAS BEEN FUNDING SEVERAL LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AT ABOUT SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT FUNDING IS SET TO EXPIRE THIS YEAR. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVESTMENT UP TO MILLION DOLLARS IN PREP NAVIGATION THAT WAS MADE A COUPLE YEARS AGO. UNFORTUNATE WERE SEEN AS THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MEET STATEWIDE DEMAND WHEN THOSE ARE OF PEAS WHEN OUT THEY RECEIVED EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS AND SO WE NEED WE KNOW THE NEED. AS MUCH GREATER THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING ALLOCATED. I AM THE NEXT PROPOSALS AROUND EDUCATING MEDICAL PROVIDERS ABOUT ADVANCES IN HIV AND STI PREVENTION. I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DOCTOR SMITH AND OTHERS MENTIONED EARLIER IS THE IMPORTANCE OF. PROVIDERS AND THEIR ABILITY TO INTERVENE AND PREVENT ACQUISITION OR TREATMENT OF HIV AND OTHER STIS. SO WE'VE SEEN THAT'S AFFECTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE THEY DO PUBLIC HEALTH DETAILING AN EXPERT GOES AROUND AND MEETS WITH PROVIDERS ONE ON ONE. DETAILING INITIATIVE WAS SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE FIRST TIME PRESCRIBING A PROP. AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO EXPAND AND REPLICATE THOSE EFFORTS WE'VE HEARD WE CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM PATIENTS ACROSS THE STATE. IN PLACES LIKE FRESNO ANOTHER WORLD JURISDICTIONS. WHERE PROVIDERS EITHER DON'T KNOW ABOUT PERHAPS OR ARE UNWILLING TO PRESCRIBE AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT SAYS NO EFFECTIVE WAY? TO INCREASE AT A PRESCRIPTION. AND THEN THE FINAL THAT I'M GONNA PRESENTED JUST SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THE STATE'S PURPOSES AND PROGRAM. THIS IT HAS WAS APPROVED TWO YEARS AGO AND IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR. THIS PROGRAM IS GONNA HELP IMPROVE ACCESS TO PREP FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS. AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SEE IT MOVING FORWARD. WE'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW GAPS IN THAT PROGRAM THAT REALLY PREVENT IT FROM PROVIDING FULL SAFETY NET COVERAGE FOR A UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED FOLKS AND SO WE PROPOSED. SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS TO THAT PROGRAM I WON'T GO INTO ALL OF THEM NOW BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. I'M IN JUST FOR THOSE WHO ARE FOLLOWING ALONG ON LINE YOU MAY WANT TO TRACK THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED PROP. PROPOSAL ONE FOUR AND FIVE A BELIEVE NOW THERE COLLEGES GO OUT OF ORDER. OKAY BETRAYED THAT I THINK THAT HOW BAY THAT THE US. AND SO YES I AM AGAIN COURTNEY FROM THE SENSE GOOD ITS FOUNDATION I WANTED TO SPEAK TO TO PROPOSALS THAT WE'RE MAKING FOR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT AIM TO. IMPROVE SERVICES AT FOUR TWO UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE GROWING OUT OF EXISTING. AND AND SUCCESSFUL MODELS THAT WE LIKE TO SEE REPLICATED IN OTHER AREAS ACROSS THE STATE. SO THE FIRST IS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THREE YEAR DEMO PROJECTS. TO IMPROVE LINKAGE AT TATE AB CARE AND PREVENTION SERVICES AS WELL AS ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PROGRAMS FAR TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS. JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME STATISTICS A ONE THIRD OF TRANSGENDER POPULATION AS I HIV POSITIVE. I'M IN FACT ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT TRANSGENDER WOMEN ARE AS MUCH AS FORTY NINE PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO BE HIV POSITIVE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. I'M IN ADDITION TRANSGENDER FOLKS I HAVE. BUT I'M THAT HAVE LOTS A JOB DID A BIAS OR UNEMPLOYED ARE MORE LIKELY TO DO BE HIV POSITIVE. ON THEY CALIFORNIA HIV RESEARCH PROJECT HOSTED I THINK. THINK TANK WITH I'M TRANSGENDER AND THOUGHT LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE LAST APRIL AND ON ECONOMIC AND ISSUES AND EMPLOYMENT ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED AS THE MAIN BARRIER TO ACCESSING HIV KAREN PREVENTION FOR THE POPULATION. AND NINETY PERCENT OF A TRANS INDIVIDUALS NATIONWIDE HAVE REPORTED HARASSMENT MISTREATMENT ARM DISCRIMINATION AT WORK. AND SO WE'RE PROPOSING DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT WOULD SEEK TO BOTH INCREASE. AND IMPROVE LINKAGE TO PREVENTION AND CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS PROVIDING WORK SKILL BUILDING AND REFERRALS TO EMPLOYERS. WHO PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT WORK ENVIRONMENT AND UPLOAD STATE NONDISCRIMINATION LAWS? AND THESE PROJECTS WIT WE BELIEVE THESE PROJECTS ARE IMPORTANT AND INNOVATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION THAT ADDRESS. THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS IMPROVED HIV PREVENTION CARE SERVICES. AS WELL AS ADDRESSING A KEY STRUCTURAL BARRIER THAT WILL IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR TRANSGENDER AND. CALIFORNIANS. OUR SECOND PROPOSAL I'M A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT PROPOSAL IS THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WOULD SUPPORT. THREE YEAR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH AM PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH HIV. SO BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE HALF OF THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND THE U. S. WILL BE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY. ARMIN SAN FRANCISCO CURRENTLY SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY SO CALIFORNIA WHICH DIED EARLY. ON EPIDEMIC IS SEEING THIS AND TRY AND SOONER. AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH HIV FACE UNIQUE CLINIC ON PSYCHO SOCIAL ISSUES AS THEY AGE SO HIV AIDS SPEEDS THE AGING PROCESS. CLIENTS ARE SEEING INCREASED CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES LIVER AND KIDNEY PROBLEMS HIV RELATED CANCERS. DECREASED BONE DENSITY FROWN ES COGNITIVE DECLINE DIMENSION DEPRESSION. AND AND THEN ISOLATION DO A LOT LOSS OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS. AND FINANCIAL AND HOUSING STE. DAD INSTABILITY DID A LONG TERM DISABILITY CLAIMS FOR MANY OF THESE CLIENTS. AND THERE'S VERY FEW COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION AM AND THE MODEL AND THAT THERE IS ONE MODEL CURRENTLY OPERATING IN SAN FRANCISCO CALLED THE GOLDEN COMPASS PROGRAM. AND IT OFFERS A A UNIQUE FOCUS SO IT LOOKS AT HEARTENED MIND BONES AND STRENGTH. DENTAL HEARING AND VISION AND NETWORKING AND NAVIGATION. AND AND THEY FIND ALL OF THEIR NON CLINICAL SERVICES THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS WHICH. ARE IS GREAT BUT ALSO INCONSISTENT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO I'M. REQUEST FUNDING TE REPLICATE THIS DEMO PROJECT ACROSS THE SEATS THAT WERE ENVISIONING SORT OF THE MEDICAL HOME MODEL. AND TO EXPAND COURTNEY AND STRENGTHEN THE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES FOR THIS POPULATION WE WOULD ALSO LIKE FOR THESE SERVICES TO BE EVALUATED. FOR IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES AND COST EFFICIENCIES THE PROJECTS WILL ALSO DISSEMINATE LESSONS LEARNED TO SPUR ONGOING SERVICES WE SEE THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE CALIFORNIA CAN REALLY BE A LEADER I'M IN HIV AND ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THESE. VERY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THINKING HERE. WITH THAT WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIXTEEN. TYCHO FROST OF HER REDUCTION COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT. GIVE. DANTE MORSE WITH A PILLOW HEALTH AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ARE MADE AWARE PREP. I'M A SPECIALLY THOUGH THAT WORK WITH THE HIGH RISK POPULATIONS I'M AS A STAND NOW PAPERS REALLY ONLY MADE AWARE BY THOSE WHO ARE HIV SPECIALIST AND THEY WORK A PERSON LIVING WITH HIV. ON THE FLIPSIDE HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS THE GOAL FOR GENERAL CARE WHO ARE AT RISK ARE NOT TOLD ABOUT PREP BECAUSE THEIR PROVIDER IS NOT HIV SPECIALIST AND IS NOT BEEN MADE ABREAST OF THAT SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THE PREP KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION IS SPREAD FAIRLY ACROSS THE BOARD. AND EVERYONE IS GETTING THE SAME INFORMATION WILL GREATLY CA INCREASE IN HIV. IN THE LACK OF NEW HIV INFECTIONS. ARENT FOX LOS ANGELES LGBT CENTER IN SUPPORT.

WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIXTEEN OPEN THEM OF BOND ISSUE SEVENTEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD EVENING DEBORAH MALDONADO TRIP POLLUTION REPRESENTING THE INLAND COALITION FOR AIDS RESOURCES AND RURAL REGIONS FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE. SO THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THIS MOMENT TO SHARE A FEW BRIEF REMARKS. MY NAME IS GABRIEL MALDONADO AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CEO OF TRUE VOLUTION. AND LGBT JUSTICE IN HIV AIDS DIRECT SERVICE ORGANIZATION SERVING THE REGION OF SABATINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY ALSO KNOWN AS THE INLAND EMPIRE. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE INLAND COALITION FOR AIDS RESOURCES IN RURAL REGIONS OF THE AND LET EMPIRE. WHICH IS MADE UP OF A GROUP OF FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AIDS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS LGBT AGENCIES AND OTHER HEALTH RELATED. ENTITIES. AS A YOUNG AFRO LATINO GAY MAN. LIVING WITH HIV FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS I REPRESENT NOT ONLY MYSELF. BUT OVER THE NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. THIRTY EIGHT OF WHO ARE CURRENTLY. AN UNMET AN ADDITIONAL FORTY ONE HUNDRED CORE UNDERWEAR OR IN NET MIGRATION WORK IN OUR JURISDICTION RECEIVING CARE. AND WITH THE BACKBONE OF APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION AND RYAN WHITE PART A FUNDS AND VARIABLE FUNDS AND SUPPLEMENT OF THE RYAN WHITE PART BE THROUGH THE STATE. THESE RESOURCES DO NOT REFLECT THE FULL RANGE OF INVESTMENTS NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY OVERCOME THE UNIQUE BARRIERS TO CARE AND PREVENTION FOR THE NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE MILES A GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORY WE COVER. THE INLAND EMPIRE IS LARGER THAN NINE STATES WITHIN THE U. S. INCLUDING NEW JERSEY. MARYLAND AND MASSACHUSETTS. ACCORDING TO PUB MED RISK FACTORS LATE TO TAX PUBLISHED BY UC RIVERSIDE'S SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. NEARLY THIRTY POINT FIVE PERCENT OF ALL NEW DIAGNOSES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE I REPEAT THAT'S ONE THIRD OF ALL NEW DIAGNOSES. FROM TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TO TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WERE LATE TO TEST AND RECEIVED AN AIDS DIAGNOSIS WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF A POSITIVE RESULT. THE FINDINGS OF RESEARCH SHOWS A DEFICIENCY IN AVAILABLE TESTING AND CARE OPPORTUNITIES. NOT LIMITED TO ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITY SUBSTANCE ABUSE HOUSING AND THE REGION'S EXPANSIVE GEOGRAPHY IS WHAT RESULTS IN THESE EXACERBATED HEALTH DISPARITIES. WHEN IT IT'S PAST ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GO FROM THE FENWAY INSTITUTE IN BOSTON TO US HELPING US IN WASHINGTON DC THAN IT IS FOR ONE OF MY CLIENTS TO GO FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO THE DESERT AIDS PROJECT IN PALM SPRINGS THAT JUST SHOWS YOU THE LACK OF ACCESS AND THE BARRIERS TO CARE THAT OUR REGION IS UNIQUELY EXPERIENCING. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NEED THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE I MERELY A REFLECTION OF THE EXPERIENCES OF THE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND OF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS LIVING WITH HIV. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE CALIFORNIA HIV ALLIANCE AND FULLY SUPPORT THEIR BUDGET ASK AND POLICY INITIATIVES AS A NECESSITY TO STATEWIDE EFFORTS AND THAT INCLUDES ISSUES. TWELVE THIRTEEN AND SIXTEEN. THE CONVERSATION AROUND HIV. IS NOT ONLY A QUESTION OF AN EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES BUT AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES. RECOGNIZING THAT WE MUST ALL TRY AND BUILD A SOLID FOUNDATION TO MEET THE NEEDS WITHIN OUR INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS AROUND THE ENTIRE STATE. WHEN WE ANALYSE THE TOTAL UNMET NEED OF APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED PERSONS AT A CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED COST PER PATIENT PER YEAR OF TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS IS NOT FACTORING IN COST ASSOCIATED WITH COMORBIDITIES EXACERBATED SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND SPECIALTY SERVICES OUR REGION HOW THE RESOURCE GAP OF TWENTY TWO MILLION SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE THOUSAND. AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND WE ARE NOT ONE OF THE RECIPIENTS OF THE FEDERAL DIRECT FUNDS FROM THE CDC. WHICH IS WHY WE ARE ONLY REQUESTING TEN MILLION AS CAPACITY BUILDING AMOUNT. TO EXPAND EXISTING SERVICES TO HELP FILL THE GAPS AND LOWER THE DEFICITS OF THOSE WHO ARE UNAWARE ARE UNMET NEEDS LIVING WITH HIV. TREATING THOSE LIVING WITH HIV ACHIEVING VIRAL SUPPRESSION LOWERING TRANSMISSION RESTS AND APPROVING OVERALL HEALTH OUTCOMES IS A NET SAVINGS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE TREATMENT AS PREVENTION MODEL AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER. AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HIV AND AIDS APPOINTED UNDER BARACK OBAMA AND CONTINUED BRIEFLY UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. I ADVOCATED FOR UNDERSERVED RULE REGION SUBURBAN REGIONS AND UNIQUELY BURDENED REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. AND AS WE NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS ERA OF MENDACITY TO SAY THE LEAST. UNDER THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION WHERE WERE SEEN THE DE HUMANIZATION AND MARGINALIZATION OF THE LEAST AMONG US. WE HERE IN THIS STATE LEGISLATOR MUST ENSURE THAT WE ALSO CRAFT OUR POLICIES WITH MORE THAN JUST POLITICAL CALCULUS AND WE HUMANIZE THE LEAST AMONG US IN THE UNIQUE JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE.
