ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT. MR BONTA YOU MAY OPEN ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES ACR ONE EXPRESSES OPPOSITION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED CHANGES. TO THE IMMIGRATION POLICY KNOWN AS PUBLIC. THAT TARGET ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CAUSE HARDSHIP TO UNTOLD NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR OWN AMERICAN DREAM. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS RUN CONTRARY TO CALIFORNIA'S VALUES INTO BIPARTISAN EFFORTS THAT. HAVE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF SUPPORTING AND WELCOMING IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. IN OUR STATE. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD EXPAND THE LIST OF BENEFITS CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING WHO CONSTITUTES A PUBLIC CHARGE BEYOND CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. TO INCLUDE HEALTHCARE HOUSING IN NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS PROGRAMS THAT HELP ALL PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES STAY HEALTHY. WORK THRIVE AND CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE AGE OF AN INDIVIDUAL BEEN UNDER EIGHTEEN AND OVER SIXTY ONE WOULD BE CONSIDERED A NEGATIVE. THE ABSENCE OF CURRENT EMPLOYMENT OR LACK OF PERSPECTIVE EMPLOYMENT THE USE OF PUBLIC BENEFITS ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND INCOME LEVEL SO QUITE LITERALLY IF YOU'RE YOUNG OR IF YOU'RE OLD IF YOU'RE SICK OR IF YOU'RE POOR. IF YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH IT WILL ALL COUNT AGAINST YOU UNDER THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS. THESE PROPOSED CHANGES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOW INCOME WORKING IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW WAGE LABORERS IN ADDITION OVER 70% OF THOSE IMPACTED. OUR CHILDREN. THESE CHANGES I'VE BEEN DEEMED A PUBLIC CHARGE AND CONSEQUENTLY DENIED LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS OR ENTRY TO THE US OR POTENTIALLY BEING SUBJECT TO DEPORTATION FOR SEEKING. ESSENTIAL BENEFITS CREATES ADDITIONAL FEAR AND CHILLING EFFECTS WITHINAND AMONG OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ACR ONE URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RECONSIDER. AND ROLL BACK THESE PROPOSED CHANGES. COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN THE NATION BOTH DOCUMENTED AND UNDOCUMENTED. AND WE HAVE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA IS STRONGER WHEN RESIDENTS IN NEED ARE ABLE TO ACCESS IT SAFETY NET WITHOUT FEAR FOR THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILIES. OR THEIR FUTURES. COLLEAGUES AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND ON BEHALF OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ON A C. R.. ONE MEMBERS PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THIS RESOLUTION.

ONE WE KNOW THAT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVED ITSELF TO BE THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE STAND. FOR WE STAND FOR JUSTICE WE STAND FOR INCLUSION WE SANTA EQUITY AND WE STAND FOR OPPORTUNITY. THE REGULATIONS PROPOSED OTHER PART BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY RUN COUNTER TO CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND BIPARTISAN EFFORTS AND RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF INTEGRATING IMMIGRANTS POPULATIONS INTO THE STATE. THE LATEST MOVE IS AN ATTACK ON CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING. THESE PROPOSED CHANGES TARGET LOW INCOME WORKING IMMIGRANTS AND BUT IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW WAGE LABORERS. THE PROPOSED BROADENING OF BENEFITS CONSIDERED WHEN MAKING QUOTE PUBLIC CHARGE DETERMINATIONS THREATENS TO DO NOT ELIGIBLE IMMIGRANTS APPLICANTS A GREEN CARD IF THEY ARE PERSON BELOW A CERTAIN INCOME LEVEL. OR ACCESS CRITICAL HEALTHCARE NUTRITION OR OTHER FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM. THESE CHANGES HAVE REAL IMPACT THE FEAR OF BEING DEEMED A PUBLIC CHARGE AND DID NOT LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS OR INTO TO THE U. S. OR POTENTIALLY BEING SUBJECT TO DEPORTATION FOR SEEKING CENTRAL BENEFITS. CREATES ADDITIONAL FEAR AMONG OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES GEN LEARNING A PARENTS WORKING AND FAMILY STRONG. ACR ONE CONDEMNS A PROPOSED CHANGES AND URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RECONSIDER AND ROLL BACK THESE CHANGES WHICH WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HARM THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF THE STATE AND THE NATION FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

THE SURVEYORS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY WOOD CUTTERS TO CUT DOWN TREES. THEY SET UP MONUMENTS WITH CANDLES. SO THEY DECIDE OVER LONG DISTANCES BY NIGHT USING THE AVAILABLE TOOLS. THAT LINE SETTLED AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD DISPUTE. AND PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN EARLY AMERICAN TO THIS BOUNDARY OF NORTH AND SOUTH. THE PRACTICE OF SURVEYING SETTLES DISPUTES.

STRETCHING OUT TO ALEC HAMBRO WHAT WE THINK VALVES ON HAMMER THE RIVER. IN OLD SACRAMENTO. HE SAID SURVEYING TEAMS TO WORK TO LAY OUT THE GRID OF DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. HIS SURVEYING TEAMS WERE ASSIGNED TO CREATE BLOCKS OF A SPECIFIED SIZE. AND THOSE TWO TEAMS MET. ON THE EDGES OF THE BLOCK BETWEEN TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH.
