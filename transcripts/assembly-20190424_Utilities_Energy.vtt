00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:51.942
WE FACE.

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:53.410
IT'S A FACT CLIMATE CHANGE IS

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:54.612
PRODUCING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:55.846
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.248
LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:59.750
WILDFIRES. ELEVEN OF THE TWENTY

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:00.951
MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN OUR

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:03.254
HISTORY OF OCCURRED JUST SINCE

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.054
TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH FIVE

00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:05.823
OCCURRING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:06.724
AND THE DEVASTATING CAMP IN WILL

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.425
THE FIRES.

00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:09.894
OCCURRING THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.428
AMONG THE ISSUES WE MUST ADDRESS

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:12.496
THIS YEAR'S A SUBSTANTIAL

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:13.797
LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.199
THESE FIRES.

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:16.200
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT UTILITIES

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.202
IN CALIFORNIA START ROUGHLY 10%

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:19.436
OF THE FIRES WE SEE STATEWIDE

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:20.638
EVERY YEAR.

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:23.274
AND APPROXIMATELY 3240% OF THE

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.209
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THAT'S

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.644
WHY WE MUST ENCOURAGE THEM TO

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.945
INCREASE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:29.346
PROCEDURES AND HARDEN THEIR

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:31.048
INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCE.

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.149
FIRE IGNITION.

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.517
IMPLEMENTING SB NINE A ONE WILL

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:35.152
LOWER VEGETATION ARE WILD LANDS

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.453
REDUCE LIABILITIES ENCOURAGE

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.721
INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE GREATER

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.423
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR LIVING IN

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:40.958
THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE.

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.192
I'M MORE EVER I SUPPORTED THE

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.494
GOVERNOR'S CALL FOR ADDITIONAL

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.361
HUNDRED MILLION VEGETATION

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:45.829
MANAGEMENT OVER WHAT WE CHIEF

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.131
LAST YEAR AND A VAST FOR AN

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.365
ADDITIONAL MUTUAL AID FUNDING

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:50.167
FOR CAL FIRE.

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:50.734
THE BATTLE FIRES WE COME UP

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:51.435
SHORT.

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:53.437
NONE THE LESS.

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.806
IT IS BOB PROBLEMATIC A MINUTE

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:57.374
IS PROBABLE THAT ONE OF THE THE

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.776
THOUSANDS OF FIRES IGNITED EVERY

00:42:58.842 --> 00:42:59.376
YEAR.

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:00.911
WILL SPIRAL INTO A CATASTROPHIC

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:02.446
EVENT.

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:03.514
WITH OR WITHOUT INVERSE

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.349
CONDEMNATION ARE SIMPLE REALITY

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.250
IS THAT THE PHYSICAL

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.551
CHARACTERISTICS OF A POWER

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:09.119
GREATER LESS THAN OPTIMAL.

00:43:09.186 --> 00:43:11.021
OUR UTILITIES ARE STILL SUBJECT

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.389
TO MASSIVE LIABILITIES.

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:13.457
FEDERAL FORCE MANAGEMENT

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:14.558
POLICIES NEED TO BE UPDATED

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:15.893
CLIMATE CHANGES MAKING MATTERS

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.161
WORSE AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS

00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:18.929
CONTINUE TO SPRAWL.

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:20.631
INTO AT RISK LOCATIONS.

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.499
YOU KNOW I AM A CONSERVATIVE AND

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:24.034
I DO BELIEVE IN MARKETS -- AND I

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:26.337
BELIEVE THAT MARKETS WORK MOST

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:28.372
OF THE TIME.

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:29.773
BUT IN THIS SCENARIO -- THEY ARE

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.308
INADEQUATE.

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.010
IT IS FINANCIALLY IN FEASIBLE

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:34.611
FOR OUR ENERGY PROVIDERS TO

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:35.879
OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CASUALTY

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:37.581
INSURANCE POLICIES TO GUARD THEM

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:39.016
FROM THE LIABILITIES WE HAVE

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:39.216
SEEN.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.418
IN RECENT YEARS FOR INSTANCE THE

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:43.220
BASE INSURANCE TARGET FOR P.

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.688
GENIE IS ROUGHLY ONE BILLION.

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.357
CONTRAST TO THE POTENTIAL THIRTY

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:47.825
BILLION IN LIABILITY THEY FACE

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:49.526
FROM RECENT FIRE EVENTS.

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:50.828
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH UTILITIES

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:52.262
THEY CITED ADDITIONAL THREE

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:53.797
HUNDRED DOLLARS THREE HUNDRED

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:54.865

OBTAIN AN ADDITIONAL BILLION

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.602
DOLLARS AND COVERS THAT IS.

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.537
THAT IS SELF INSURANCE.

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:01.605
AND THESE LIABILITIES AREN'T

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:03.207
JUST LIMITED TO P. JEANNIE THE

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:04.975
MARKETS AND RATING AGENCIES HAVE

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:05.976
DOWNGRADED OUR OTHER INVESTOR

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:07.311
OWNED UTILITIES AND ARE

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:08.545
EXAMINING OUR PUBLICLY OWNED

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:09.747
UTILITIES BECAUSE INVERSE

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:10.814
CONDEMNATION APPLIES TO THEM AS

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:12.349
WELL THIS IS JUST.

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.784
THIS IS JUST DESPITE THE FACT

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.352
THAT ESTEEM JEANNIE HAS NOT BEEN

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:16.420
FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:17.921
MAJOR DEVASTATING WILDFIRE OVER

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:20.457
THE PAST DECADE -- BREAKING UP

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:21.492
OUR UTILITY.

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:25.295
THIS THING'S TOO LONG -- WE'VE

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.997

GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION -- AND

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.278
I WANT TO OFFER UP ON THAT AS A

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.546
REPUBLICAN.

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:45.082
THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE.

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:47.151
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:48.819
AFFECTS CALIFORNIA.

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.554
AND OFTEN TIMES IN THE POLITICAL

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:53.057

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:55.793
THREAT.

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:57.461
BUT QUITE FRANKLY BEFORE US WE

00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:59.763
DO HAVE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.298
AND WE NEED TO BE COMMITTED TO

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:02.900
IT IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO BE

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:04.368
ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:44.528
THE CONVERSATION GOING I THINK

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:45.929

UTILITY INDUSTRY -- BUT THEY'RE

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:09.419
A LOT OF REPAIRS AND TAXPAYERS

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:12.222
ARE A LITTLE NERVOUS AS WELL SO.

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.957
MAKING SURE THAT WE DO SOMETHING

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:16.493
THAT IS A SMART INAPPROPRIATE

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.728

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:11.181
MY PROBLEM WITH MAY IS THAT MAY

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:16.153

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:17.554
ONE SURE BANKRUPT.

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.456
YOUR COST OF BOUGHT WELL FIRST

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.024

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:23.093
TO REALLY FIX THINGS UP YOU NEED

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.828
A FEW BILLION DOLLARS WELL ONCE

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:27.197
YOU'RE IN BANKRUPTCY YOUR COST

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:28.265

[inaudible]

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.234
FURTHER.

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.736
THE GOVERNOR WAS CRITICIZING

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:34.071
THEM FOR SAYING WHAT WE WANT TO

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.473
SELL EQUITY AT 16%.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.974
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:40.377
SHOULD BE SIXTEEN OR TWELVE BUT

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:42.279
I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU TRIED TO

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:44.081
DO IT AT A NORMAL RATE.

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.716
NOBODY WOULD BUY YEAH.

00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:48.952
UNTIL YOU HAVE A WAY OF KEEPING

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:51.888
UTILITIES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY.

00:49:51.955 --> 00:49:53.256
THE RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA PAY

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:54.791
THROUGH THE NOSE AND YOU KNOW

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:56.293
THIS AND I KNOW THIS.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.794
I'M HOPING THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT

00:49:57.861 --> 00:49:59.096
HERE LISTENING TO ME THE

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:02.199
STUPIDEST THING WE EVER DID.

SELECT P. JEANNIE GO BANKRUPT.

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:06.470
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA COST ALL OF

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:08.705
US IN THE STATE WHO LIVE IN THAT

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:10.874
TERRITORY A LOT OF MONEY.

00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:13.543
AND HAD THEY YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:14.711
THINK.

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:16.046
AT SOME OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE --

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:17.514
RATE PAYER SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.715
FOR THIS.

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.050
THEY'RE PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:22.786
RIGHT NOW IN IN THE END.

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:23.854
WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.589
FROM IT COMES FROM RATEPAYERS

00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:27.457
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:30.694
AND LETTING IT INTO BANKRUPTCY

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:33.530
JUST MEANS COSTS GO UP AND UP SO

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:33.730
AGAIN.

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.999
THIS IS.

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:38.168
GOING THROUGH AND CAN CHANGE A

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:40.237
LOT THAT I THINK THE MAY SHOULD

00:50:40.303 --> 00:50:41.138
BECOME A SHELL.

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:45.008

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.087
MAKE SURE THAT THE PACKAGE

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:32.656

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.791

THANKFUL FOR THE DIALOGUE THAT

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:37.494
WE'VE HAD SO FAR BUT THIS IS THE

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:38.628
FIRST COMMITTEE AS WE WORK

00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:40.464
THROUGH THE PROCESS -- I I THINK

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:44.468
IT'S GOING TO BECOME A PRODUCT

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:45.035
THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:50.040
THANK -- YOU KNOW I I HAVE NOT

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.274
TO BEEN.

00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:53.877
PART OF THE THE SELECT COMMITTEE

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.679
OR ARE -- SOME THE DETAILED

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:57.714
CONVERSATIONS THAT -- THAT

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.115
YOU'VE BEEN.

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:03.520
PART OF BUT DIDN'T CAN YOU --

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:05.956
EXPLAIN TO ME A YOU KNOW A THE

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:07.858
THE GIVE ME THE SIMPLIFIED

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:10.627
VERSION AS TO WHY.

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:14.931
THE AVAILABLE PRIVATE INSURANCE

00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:17.434
INDUSTRY IS NOT ABLE.

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:20.403
TO ADEQUATELY COVER SURE I WOULD --

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:21.004
THEN THAT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:23.340
QUESTION -- WHICH TOOK US A LONG

00:52:23.406 --> 00:52:24.841
TIME TO GET TO YOU ROM TO EVEN

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.376
ASK THAT QUESTION.

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:27.944
BECAUSE IN REALITY IF THERE IS

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:29.412
GOING TO BE ANY SORT OF A FUND

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:31.181
IT IT WOULD BE LIKE AN INSURANCE

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.782
FUND IT'S AN INSURANCE PRODUCT

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.784
THAT THE UTILITIES WOULD BUY

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:35.519
INTO.

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:36.453
SO THAT YOU KNOW WHY CREATING

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.355
NEW AUTHORITY WHY HAVE A

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.056
GOVERNING BOARD WHY.

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:41.525
THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO CAPITALIZE

00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:42.659
IT WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT JUST BY

00:52:42.726 --> 00:52:44.194
AN INSURANCE PRODUCT.

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:45.729
SO WE TALKED TO SOME EXPERTS --

00:52:45.795 --> 00:52:47.497
AND WE FOUND OUT THAT YOU CAN'T

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:49.065
BUY THERE ISN'T IN THE

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:51.001
INTERNATIONAL MARKET YOU CAN'T

00:52:51.067 --> 00:52:53.670
GET FIFTEEN TWENTY THIRTY

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.005
BILLION DOLLARS -- UNLESS YOU

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.406
PAY FOR A FIFTEEN BILLION OUR

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:57.908
POLICY TO PROBABLY COST YOU

00:52:57.974 --> 00:52:59.709
FOURTEEN BILLION -- WELL THAT

00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:01.645
THAT'S THE YOU KNOW THAT'S

00:53:01.711 --> 00:53:02.445
THAT'S NOT INSURANCE ITSELF

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:04.881
INSURANCE THAT'S WHY THE FLORIDA

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:06.983
HURRICANE FUND -- THAT WAS

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:07.617
FOUNDED BECAUSE THEY FOUND IN

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:09.286
FLORIDA THAT THEY COULDN'T GO

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:11.288
OUT AND BUY INSURANCE UP EITHER

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:12.822
AND THERE WAS THIS PROBLEM THAT

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:13.089
THEY HAD.

00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:14.324
A TO FIX.

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:15.825
THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO FIX

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:17.394
HERE IS WE HAVE ELECTRIC

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.863
UTILITIES -- THAT THE RATING

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.164
AGENCIES BELIEVE OR NOT --

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.299
INVESTABLE OR ARE BEING

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:24.167
DOWNGRADED BECAUSE THE LIABILITY

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:26.036
FROM THESE WILDFIRES ARE TOO

00:53:26.102 --> 00:53:27.203
GREAT IN ESSENCE WHAT I'M SAYING

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.405
THAT THERE ISN'T AN INSURANCE

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:29.973
PRODUCT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.474
TO BUY OR WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYBODY

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:32.909
COME TO TALK TO US.

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:33.510
THE TELL US THAT THERE IS AN

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:34.911
INSURANCE PRODUCT -- THAT WOULD

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:38.915
HAVE TO BUY WHICH IS WHY IN

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:42.118
ESSENCE WE NEED TO SELF INSURE.

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:44.154

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.156

I NEED.

00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:50.226
TO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE DID

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:51.795

REALITIES OF TRYING TO ADDRESS?

00:53:58.835 --> 00:54:00.770
OF THE IMPACTS THAT OBVIOUSLY

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:02.939
WHEN A UTILITY OF THAT SIZE DOES

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.240
GO.

INTO BANKRUPTCY THE RIPPLE

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:07.978
EFFECT. TO THE REST OF THE

00:54:08.044 --> 00:54:09.346
MARKET IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.314

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.936
THE RECORD AT THE PVC -- WE'RE

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:02.371
HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.306
CONCERNS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:06.542
THIS BILL WE DO RECOGNIZE THE

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.077
AUTHORS LAUDABLE GOAL HERE.

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.612
OUR CONCERN IS WITH THE

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:10.846
SHORTENED TIME FRAME.

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:12.681
ON WERE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO

01:09:12.748 --> 01:09:14.650
PERFORM THE SITE VISITS TO

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:16.352
EXAMINE THE BOOKS AND RECORDS OF

01:09:16.418 --> 01:09:17.753
THE SAFETY PROGRAMS OF THESE

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:18.821
UTILITIES.

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:20.990
AND WE WANTED TO ALSO TRY TO

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:22.324
COST EFFECTIVELY IN TIMELY

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:26.829
SEVERAL THESE ISSUES WITH

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:28.497
UTILITIES INVOLVED -- IT'S

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:29.265
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:29.999
ACQUISITIONS ORAL OFTEN

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:30.699
CONTROVERSIAL.

01:09:30.766 --> 01:09:32.401
THEY RAISE MANY LEGAL POLICY

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:33.869
ISSUES AND THEY CAN

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:36.338
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE CUSTOMERS

01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:37.706
MONTHLY BILLS.

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.875
SO OUR CONCERN IS WITH A SHORT

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.410
TIME FRAME BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:44.213
TO RUSH INTO MAKING RASH DISHES

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.282
DECISIONS HERE -- THERE'S ALSO

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.284
AN EXPEDITED PROCESS AT THE P.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.585
YOU SEE WHERE THE STATE WATER

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:51.587
CONTROL BOARD CAN GET INVOLVED.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:54.857
AND WORK WITH THE PC TO EXPEDITE

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.325
THESE ACQUISITION PROCEEDINGS.

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:57.526
AND SO TYPICALLY THESE HAVE BEEN

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:59.194
DONE WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY

01:09:59.261 --> 01:09:59.962
DAYS.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.197
ON IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:04.667
WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL.

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.368
BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORS

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.370
OF ALTHOUGH IT LAUDABLE INTENT

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.272
THANK YOU.

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.241
OF ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC HERE

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:13.776
TO SPEAK AND OF OPPOSITION TO

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:15.544

SO I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:27.823
THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE AS MY

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.458
MONEY TO SAY HASTE MAKES WASTE.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:30.826
AND I HAVE SAT IN THIS COMMITTEE

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.127
LONG ENOUGH THAT WE CALLED THE

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:33.596
C. P. YOU SEE UP HERE REGULARLY

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.930
TO BEAT THEM UP ON NOT BEING

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:36.265
ABLE TO FILL THEIR MISSION.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.100
AND THEN WE KEEP ADDING MORE AND

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.568
MORE THINGS WITH TIGHTER AND

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:40.903
TIGHTER TIME LINES THAT WE ADD

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.538
UPON.

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:45.040
WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY ASKED TO DO --

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:45.641
AND SO ANYTHING WE'RE TALKING

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:46.141
ABOUT.

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:48.377
DRINKING WATERING CONSOLIDATION

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:50.179
OF BIG SYSTEMS IT'S IMPORTANT

01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:51.847
THAT WE GET THOSE THINGS RIGHT

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:53.916
AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.618
GOAL OF THIS BILL I THINK WE

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:56.919
STILL HAVE SOME DETAILS TO WORK

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:58.887
OUT ON THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:00.889

IN THIS AND THAT WE GET IT'S

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:05.828
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:37.026
ANALYSIS IN THE TO

CONSIDERATIONS OF OF THESE CUTS

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.895
WHAT I WOULD ASSUME TO BE

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.463
COMPLICATED ISSUES WITH WHAT

PUBLIC ADVOCATES SO I CAN'T

AGREE WITH EVERYONE MORE.

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:47.236
LISTEN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:48.704
ADDRESS IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:50.205
MANY COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:51.774
HAVE ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER WE

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.475
HAVE TO SYSTEMS THAT HAVE AGREED

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:55.010
TO COME TOGETHER WHERE YOU HAVE

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:56.578
RESIDENTS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.246
THAT HAVE AGREED THAT THE SIR TO

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:58.113

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.682
AND THESE APPLICATIONS ARE

OF FOLKS BEING DENIED WATER SO

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:06.388
WE WANT TO PUSH EVERYONE TO DO

THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:16.965
HAS ASKED US TO TAKE AMENDMENTS

01:12:17.032 --> 01:12:18.967
THAT ENSURE THAT IF IT TURNS OUT

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:20.035
THAT SOMETHING'S GONNA TAKE A

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.203
LITTLE TOO LONG AND I WILL QUOTE

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.438
FROM THE AMENDMENTS.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.439
THE COMMISSION IS AUTHORIZED TO

OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:37.486
SO ESSENTIALLY WERE SAYING AS WE

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:38.620

01:12:59.041 --> 01:12:59.742
YEARS AGO.

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.844
AND WE ARE THE CITY'S KILEY

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.479
SUBSIDIZING WATER RATES AND IT'S

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.380

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.083
THERE'S AN AGREEMENT ON ALL

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.451
PARTIES IN THE COMMUNITY HAS

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:11.787
SPOKEN BUT THE DELAYS AT THE PC

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:12.955
I HAVE MADE IT REALLY DIFFICULT

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:15.090
THERE TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO --

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.425
I APPRECIATE REMOVING THEIR PRE

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.926

MAYBE ISSUES OTHER MISSION BEING

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:27.836
A LITTLE TOO MUCH -- AND WE HAVE

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.471
OTHER SOLUTIONS AND THAT WE

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:30.939
MIGHT NEED TO BE CONSIDERING.

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.574
LONG TERM BUT IN THE SHORT TERM

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:37.346
STUFF LIKE THIS IS HELPFUL SO I

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:37.980
WILL BE WAITING FOR A BILL TODAY

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.114
THANK YOU.

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.950
ANY OTHER A QUESTION OF SOMEONE

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:49.792
EVEREST -- IT OKAY [inaudible]

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.493
SEVEN ARRESTS.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.394
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:52.694
OPPOSITION.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:55.731
KNOWING THAT THE FLEXIBILITY WAS

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.299
PUT INTO THE BILL AS AN

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.501
AMENDMENT ALLOWING FOR

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:01.069
EXTENSIONS.

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:02.437
I I ONE OF THINGS I SEE THAT IS

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:04.506
BENEFICIAL TO THAT IS THAT

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:05.874
SOMEBODY HAS TO BE HANDS ON

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.109
BEFORE THEY CAN ASK FOR AN

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.143
EXTENSION.

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.578
SO SOME ATTENTION WILL HAVE TO

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:10.779
BE GIVEN.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:12.414
TO THIS APPLICATION THAT IS

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:14.683
PENDING.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.286
BUT THE FLEXIBILITY IS THERE. TO

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:19.154
ALLOW FOR EXTENSIONS.

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:22.558
IN YOUR OPPOSITION CONSIDERING.

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:25.294
CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT PART OF IT --

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.829
I KNOW WITH THE U. R. POST BUT

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:28.363
TELL US ABOUT THIS FLEXIBILITY

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.599
AND WHY THAT IS NOT WORKABLE.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:31.466
OKAY.

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:33.268
SO FIRST I WANT TO DELINEATE MY

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.871
OFFICE'S ROLE FROM THE CPU SEES.

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.573
THE CPUC IS THE DECISION THAT

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.675
THE DECISION MAKER THEY DECIDE

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:41.910
WHEN TO ACT AND NOT TO ACT SO I

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:42.511
DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ON THEIR

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.246
BEHALF AND FOR ANY ADDITIONAL

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.914
QUESTIONS I THINK THEY'RE BETTER

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.182
DRESSED TO THE PC.

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:48.584
BUT FROM MY AUNT TO THE PUBLIC

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.384
ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WERE

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:50.819
RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THAT

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:52.955
RECORD FOR THE PC TO MAKE WELL

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.356
INFORMED DECISIONS.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:55.757
IN CUSTOMERS BEST INTERESTS

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:58.293
BECAUSE ON WE ALL HAVE YOU'LL

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.895
HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO GET DON'T

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.029
HAVE THE TIME OR THE WHERE WITH

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.397
ALL TO NAVIGATE.

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.132
THE COMPLICATED STATE PROCESS

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:05.567
SEES OKAY.

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:06.802
ON THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.538
ARE BEYOND MY OFFICES CONTROL

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.340
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE -- WE WE

01:15:11.406 --> 01:15:13.508
SUBMITTED REQUESTS MY OFFICE HAS

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:14.576
ACCESS TO ALL THE SAME

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.311
INFORMATION THAT THE PC DOES

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:17.980
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.147
THAT'S WHAT SETS US APART FROM

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:22.684
OTHER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS --

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.286
BUT WE SUBMITTED A REQUEST

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.354
SOMETIMES IT TAKES WEEKS

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.189
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A FEW MONTHS

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.290
TO GET THE INFORMATION FROM THE

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.491
UTILITY.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:30.726
OUR CONCERN IS WHEN THERE ARE

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.595
DELAYS.

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.564
ON THAT ARE TAKING PLACE THOSE

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:36.665
ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND WHEN

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:38.233
YOU SAID A LINE IN THE SAND.

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.768
ON HOW DO YOU CONTROL THOSE

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:40.936
DELAYS US GETTING THAT

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:43.005
INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO BUILD

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.506
THAT RECORD AT THE PC.

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:47.109
ON FOR AND THIS IS NOT DIRECTED

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:48.577
TO THE WATER UTILITIES OR ANYONE

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.779
BUT FOR EXAMPLE THERE MOTIONS

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:53.015
FILED BY THE UTILITIES LIKE.

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.083
HE IT IN THE EVENT THEY WANT TO

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:56.852
CHANGE THE NUMBER OF PAGES OF

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.287
THE FILING FOR EXAMPLE.

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.222
A JUDGE NEEDS TO WILL NOT IT AT

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:01.723
THE PC SO THEN THERE'S A TIME

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:04.693
THAT SPENT FINDING THE JUDGE AND

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.260
AND HAVING THE JUDGE RULE ON

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.129
THAT GREAT. TO HAVE TO HAVE ALL

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:09.564
THESE ELEMENTS OF KERR AND THEN

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.767
REALIZE WHERE YOU ARE TO WEAR TO

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:15.203
WIN THE PEACE HE NEEDS TO ACT.

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:16.305
AND SO.

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:16.872
IF IF IF WE WANT TO GET THIS

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:17.806
RIGHT WE NEED TO DO OUR DUE

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:20.409
DILIGENCE AND SO AGAIN.

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:22.477
I RECOGNIZE THE LAUDABLE GOALS

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:24.613
THE AUTHOR IS LAUDABLE GOALS BUT

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.581
THERE HAS TO BE A WORKABLE TIME

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:29.251
FRAME HERE.

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:30.819
IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN.

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:33.522
IF IF THE TIME FRAME AS I

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:35.290
UNDERSTAND.

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.025
AS I UNDERSTAND IS NOT SET IN

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:40.028
STONE AND IT IS A LINE DRAWN IN

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.330
THE SAND IT IS.

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:43.031
WELL ACTUALLY IT IS DRAWN IN THE

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.800
SAND AND YOU CAN ERASE IT AND

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:46.001
YOU CAN EXTENDED AND DRAW THE

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.703
NEW LINE ANY RACE THAT IF YOU

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:51.406
HAVE -- TO SO.

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:52.441
I APPRECIATE AND I WANT TO GO

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:53.542
BACK TO YOUR WORDS IT'S A

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:55.477
LAUDABLE GOAL AND I THINK THAT

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:57.279
JUST AS MS GARCIA HAS AS

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:58.880
INDICATED HER CITY.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.082
WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:01.717
SOMEBODY OVERLOOKED THIS TO MAKE

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:03.518
SURE THAT THERE ARE TIME LINES

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:06.989
AND SOMEBODY HAS THIS URGENCY

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:08.724
ABOUT GETTING IT TAKEN CARE OF

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.927
IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO TAKE

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.528
CARE OF THIS LAUDABLE GOAL.

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.230
THAT MISTER THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.366
CHIU HAS WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:18.533
MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.535
THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO SEE IF

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:22.304
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:25.073
CRAFT TOGETHER [inaudible]

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.875
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:29.644
DOCTOR QUIRK -- SO THIS BILL

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:30.812
WENT THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:32.381
SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIAL OF THE

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:34.349
VOTING FOR HERE TODAY I WOULD

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:36.118
JUST TELL OUR MEMBERS WHO

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:38.053
RELUCTANT TO VOTE FOR THIS THAT

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.321
THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT.

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.156
AND IN THE END WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:43.191
DOING IS EXPRESSING THE WILL OF

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:45.193
THE LEGISLATURE THAT THESE GO

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.428
MORE QUICKLY.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.696
BUT SINCE THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.398
EVEN IF.

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.699
THE COMMITTEE HAD NOT PUT THOSE

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.567
AMENDMENTS IN.

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:53.769
ALL I THINK THE MANAGER GOOD

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.203
BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO GIVEN

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:56.304
THE TARGET.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.473
BUT I'M AS GUILTY AS ANYBODY AS

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.409
TELLING DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:02.611
HAVE A DEADLINE AND THEN THE

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:04.279
DEADLINE COMES AND GOES.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:08.083
AND YOU REALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING --

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:10.752
BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:12.854
SO THAT PUBLIC ADVOCATE.

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.322
CPUC DOESN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:16.158
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THERE IS

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:17.426
NO PENALTY.

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.361
IT'S SIMPLY WE'RE SAYING WE

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:20.462
THINK IT OUGHT TO BE DONE MORE

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:23.131
QUICKLY IN GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY.

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:25.067
BUT THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:27.135
THERE IS TOO MUCH TO DO AND

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:28.270
WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM HE

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:29.971
DIRECTOR OF THE P. YOU SEE AS

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.073
WELL.

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:32.240
THERE'S TOO MUCH TO DO AND THEY

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:34.776
HAVE HAND CUFFS ON SOME OF WHICH

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:36.344
WE PUT ON WHILE I WAS HERE.

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:38.747
AND IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.482
FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING -- THEY

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:42.651
CAN'T TALK TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:46.688
PUBLIC MEETINGS -- IT JUST GETS.

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:49.391
VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:50.425
DO ANYTHING.

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:51.626
AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:54.496
RE THINK THE P. YOU SEE.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.498
ARE PERHAPS MOVING PARTS OF IT

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:59.968
AWAY -- PERHAPS MORE RESOURCES I

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:01.403
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.438
BUT I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:04.272
BILL.

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:05.574
AGAIN I THINK IT'S SIMPLY

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.009
REFLECTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:09.478
THINKS THEY SHOULD BE DONE MORE

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:12.114
QUICKLY BUT IN THE END THERE IS

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:15.484
NO ENFORCEMENT -- IT WELL IT.

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:16.718
EXPRESSES THE WILL OF THE

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.353
LEGISLATURE TO GIVE THIS MORE

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:23.859
PRIORITY THAT'S WHAT IT DOES.

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:28.930
IF FOR NO OTHER ARE QUESTIONS --

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.432
WE WERE CHIU YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:31.867
APPRECIATE THE THE THE

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.668
CONVERSATION OF COURSE OF MY

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:34.603
STAFF HAS ALREADY BEEN ENGAGING

01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:35.871
WITH THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.672
ADVOCATE WE WE WOULD LOOK

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.040
FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT YOU

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:40.175
THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DOING IN

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:42.210
THIS INSTANCE BECAUSE WE NEED TO

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:43.678
MOVE THIS FORWARD AND I DO THANK.

01:19:43.745 --> 01:19:44.613
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:46.681
DISAGREE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.315
THESE WATER CONSOLIDATIONS MORE

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:49.684
QUICKLY -- RESPONDED TO TO

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:50.652
MISTER PARKS POINT WHILE THERE

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.187
IS NO ENFORCEMENT THE FACT THAT

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:52.888
THERE ARE.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.289
TIME LINES IN THE FACT THAT WE

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:56.191
NEED TO TRACK WHETHER PROJECTS

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:58.360
ARE BEING MET GIVES US AN

01:19:58.426 --> 01:20:00.228
ABILITY TO HAVE SOME DATA. TO BE

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.063
ABLE TO TO TO TO TELL ALL THE

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:03.765
PARTIES -- IT'S LATE IT'S LATE

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:04.966
AGAIN IT'S LATE AGAIN AND JUST

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:05.934
KEEP PUTTING THAT PRESSURE I

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:07.569
THINK THAT IS A BENEFIT IN AND

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.804
OF ITSELF -- BUT BUT AGAIN

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:10.805
WITHOUT I WANNA JUST MAKE IT

01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:12.541
VERY CLEAR THESE ARE FLEXIBLE

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:14.242
DEADLINES I INITIALLY THOUGHT

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:15.777
ABOUT INSTITUTING MANDATED

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.412
DEADLINES AND REALIZE WE ARE

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:18.647
LIKELY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:20.215
SO I DECIDED TO CREATE FLEXIBLE

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:20.949
DEADLINES.

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.817

FLEXIBLE.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.889
LINES IN EASILY MANIPULATED SAND

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.991
BUT I A VERY MUCH THINK WE NEED

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:30.892
TO DO THIS BECAUSE WHAT IS AT

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.227
STAKE A MILLION PEOPLE STILL

THE OPPOSITION -- THERE'S A

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.636
COUPLE OF THINGS GOING ON HERE

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:42.737
FIRST OF ALL.

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:44.972
TALKED ABOUT TARP IN THE TARP

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:47.608
CASE IT WAS EASY TO DO THIS

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:50.945
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WAS

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:51.512
BAILING OUT THE COMPANIES.

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:53.748
AND SO OF COURSE YOU COULD

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:55.283
DECIDE LOTS OF THINGS.

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:58.085
HAD WE PRESENT PREVENTED P.

01:30:58.152 --> 01:30:59.754
JEANNIE FROM GOING BANKRUPT.

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:01.522
BY STANDING BASICALLY

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:03.257
GUARANTEEING THEIR DEBTS WHICH

01:31:03.324 --> 01:31:04.625
IS SOMETHING I SUGGESTED TO THE

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:06.327
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE COULD

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:07.528
APPOINT THE BOARD.

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:08.696
MAYBE ALL OF THEM SHOULD BE

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:11.065
SAFETY ENGINEERS WE COULD REPORT

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.233
WE COULD GET A POINT THAT OF THE

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.734
COMPANY.

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:14.368
THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD HAVE

01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:16.938
DONE NOW THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY I

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.373
I DO HAVE CONSIDERABLE DOUBT

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.908
THAT THIS CAN BE ENFORCED.

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:23.778
BUT I THINK THAT.

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:25.847
WE MADE A MISTAKE IN NINE OH ONE

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.849
BECAUSE WE GAVE UP THE ABILITY

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:28.850
TO TELL.

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:31.452
THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY WHAT HIS --

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:32.820
AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IT WITH

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.488
ANOTHER BELL I'D SAY WHICH JUST

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:35.957
GET RID OF NINE OO THAT

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.325
PROVISION OF NINE A ONE YOU WERE

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:39.360
TRYING TO FIX ONE MISTAKE WITH

01:31:39.427 --> 01:31:40.228
ANOTHER.

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:41.929
ARM I AGREE THAT EXECUTIVE

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.931
COMPENSATION WRIT LARGE ACROSS

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:46.534
THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:47.735
TIMES BIGGER THAN IT SHOULD BE.

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:50.137
BUT IN THE END PGP.

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:52.540
IS A VERY TROUBLED COMPANY IT'S

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.342
GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:56.644
RECRUIT SOMEONE THEY HAVE

01:31:56.711 --> 01:31:58.112
RECRUITED SOMEONE.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:31:59.847
AND FRANKLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:01.148
GET SOMEBODY TO GO IN THERE

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:02.817
CHEAP MAYBE MY SON WOULD TAKE

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:05.486
THE JOB BUT I DON'T THINK -- I

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:06.821
DON'T THINK SOMEBODY WHO HAS

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.656
EXPERIENCE RUNNING UTILITY WOULD

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:10.191
GO IN THERE FOR CHEAP.

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:11.959
I DO NOW WITH THE SPECIAL MASTER

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:13.628
THAT THEY PROBABLY LOOK AT THAT

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:15.763
IN THE END THE COMPENSATION

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.265
WOULD BE FAIRLY HIGH.

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:20.201
SO I'M JUST NOT GOING TO SUPPORT

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:26.540
THIS BILL TODAY -- WOULD YOU

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:29.410
LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE THE

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:31.913
COMMENTS OF OPPOSITION -- BUT

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:33.314
LET ME ALSO SAY BEFORE YOU DO

01:32:33.381 --> 01:32:33.514
THAT.

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:34.849
I THINK WE ALL.

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:37.385
KIND OF WENT THROUGH A COMMITTEE

01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:38.986
WENT THROUGH IN OUR OWN MINDS.

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.554
THE ACTIONS IN THE WORK DONE BY

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:43.691
THE NINE A ONE ON NINE A ONE

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:46.594
LAST YEAR AND ADDRESSING THIS

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:49.830
ISSUE -- AND I I THINK THAT WHAT

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.766
WE WERE REALLY.

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:52.967
WELL WHAT I WAS REALLY COMING

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.702
DOWN TO IS TRYING TO BALANCE

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:56.304
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:57.672
BEEN RAISED.

01:32:57.738 --> 01:33:01.542
BUT ALSO ARE RECOGNIZED IN THIS

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:04.078
INSTANCE THERE IS THIS --

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:08.549
UTILITY THAT HAS IN MANY WAYS

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:13.154
DEMONSTRATED A LOT OF DISREGARD.

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.622
FOR SAFETY.

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:17.058
AS IT RELATES -- TO THE

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:19.293
TERRITORY AND TERMS OF WHICH IT

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.363
REPRESENTS AND THE DECISION

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.465
MAKERS THE CULTURES AT THE TOP --

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:27.168
AND SO I I THINK WE TRIED TO PUT

01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:29.170
IN HERE SOME PROVISIONS THAT --

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:30.471
SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD THE

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:31.806
SPECIAL MASTER BECAUSE I DON'T

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:33.407
DISAGREE WITH DOCTOR QUIRK I

01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:34.742
THINK WE ALL.

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:36.911
WANT TO SEE GOING FORWARD THAT

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:39.213
THIS THIS -- UTILITY HAS THE

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.415
OPPORTUNITY -- TO GET BACK ON

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:42.917

AND AND BE SUCCESSFUL -- BUT I

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.458

IMPORTANT POINTS THAT -- NEED TO

01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:56.597
BE RECOGNIZED AND AND SO WE

WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH --

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:05.940
MINDFUL OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:08.709
ARE REYES AND HOPEFULLY WE DID A

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:10.778
GOOD JOB IN DOING THAT.

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:11.112
THE TURNOUT.

01:34:11.178 --> 01:34:11.645
I THANK YOU A LOT OF THE

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:14.015
OPPOSITION WAS TO THE INITIAL

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:15.483
ATTEMPT TO TRY AND GET OUR HANDS

01:34:15.549 --> 01:34:16.851
AROUND THIS ISSUE.

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:17.952
THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON THE

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:19.487
COMPENSATION WHAT THIS DOES IS

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:20.788
IT PUTS IN PLACE A SPECIAL

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:23.290
MASTER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:25.326
THAT THEY ARE TYING DECISIONS

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:26.961
AROUND COMPENSATION TO THE

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:29.897
PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS WE HAVE.

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:31.432
A CORPORATION THIS WOULD SENSE

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:32.566
TO BE ONLY APPLYING THE P.

01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:34.235
JEANNIE AT THIS POINT.

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:36.537
BECAUSE OF THE THE WAY THAT THE

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:37.705
UTILITY IS GOING TO BE TO FIND

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:39.940
THE SIZE THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:41.675
AND GIVEN ITS TRACK RECORD OVER

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:42.910
THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS OF

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.945
FAILING TO MEET ITS PUBLIC

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.147
SAFETY OBLIGATIONS.

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:47.481
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:48.582
OF OTHER UTILITIES ACROSS THE

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:50.551
STATE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:51.652
PREVIOUS FIRES?

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:53.587
AND DISASTERS THAT THAT THEY HAD

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:55.423
TO ADDRESS THEY PUT INTO PLACE

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:57.291
RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THEY

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.360
PUT IN PLACE A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:01.162
TO ENSURE THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:02.296
ARE.

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:03.364
MEET THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PUBLIC

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:04.632
SAFETY P. JEANNIE ABSOLUTELY

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:07.101
FAILED TO DO THAT AND NOW HAS

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:09.770
COME TO THE STATE.

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:11.572
TO FIND SOME WAY TO RELIEVE

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:12.973
THEMSELVES A LIABILITY TO GET.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.141
US TO BAIL THEM OUT AT SOME

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:15.609
POINT.

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:17.878
THERE WERE STILL WE HAVE A LONG

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:20.915
WAY TO GO TO SOLVE THE ISSUE OF

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:22.450
MAKING SURE THEY THAT THE GRID

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.285
STAYS APPROPRIATE OR PROVIDING

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:25.953
ELECTRICITY EVERYONE'S HOME.

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.622
AND HAVING A PROVIDER THAT THAT

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:30.324
IS VIABLE WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:32.059
IF THEY DON'T MAKE APPROPRIATE

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:33.761
DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THEY'RE

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:34.862
GOING TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:36.997
AND EXPECT US. TO CONTINUE TO

01:35:37.064 --> 01:35:39.733
STEP UP AND HELP THEM OUT WHEN

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.202
THEY'VE MADE INCORRECT DECISIONS.

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:43.404
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS A

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:45.139
LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT STAND FOR

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:46.474
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.942
CREATES A SPECIAL MASTER WHICH

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.677
IS LEGAL AND IS APPROPRIATE FOR

01:35:49.743 --> 01:35:50.377
US TO DO.

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:52.379
BECAUSE AS AS A UTILITY THAT SIT

01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:53.981
SORT OF BETWEEN A PUBLIC ENTITY

01:35:54.048 --> 01:35:55.983
IN A PRIVATE ENTITY THE STATE

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.218
HAS A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:59.453
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEY'VE GONE

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.488
INTO BANKRUPTCY.

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:01.856
A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN HOW

01:36:01.922 --> 01:36:02.723
THE COMPANY COMES OUT OF

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:10.296
JURISDICTIONS.

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:14.500
OVER 70% OF THE CUSTOMERS WITHIN

01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:15.234
THOSE CCA'S.

01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:16.235

02:03:26.699 --> 02:03:28.734
CONTROLS THE ENERGY MARKETS AND

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:31.036
IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:33.005
THAT -- TWENTY TO THIRTY

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:35.708
GIGAWATTS OF POWER THAT COMES ON

02:03:35.775 --> 02:03:38.477
BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHT IS THERE.

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:40.212
THEY'RE GONNA ALWAYS MAKE SURE

02:03:40.279 --> 02:03:42.148
OF THAT THE PROBLEM IS.

02:03:42.214 --> 02:03:44.316
IF THE LOAD SERVING AMITY HASN'T

02:03:44.383 --> 02:03:46.185
GOT ENOUGH OF ITS OWN POWER.

02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:47.853
THEN IT HAS TO BUY ON THE I SO

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:49.188
MARKET PLACE.

02:03:49.255 --> 02:03:51.891
THAT'S JUST MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE

02:03:51.957 --> 02:03:54.026
THAN BUYING IT IF YOU'VE GOT A

02:03:54.093 --> 02:03:56.262
LONG TERM CONTRACT YOU HAVE A

02:03:56.328 --> 02:03:57.863
LONG TERM CONTRACT.

02:03:57.930 --> 02:03:59.899
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT.

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:03.135
A SOME SOME SOURCE THAT.

02:04:03.202 --> 02:04:05.805
BATTERIES OR GAS POWER PLANT

02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:07.706
WHATEVER YOU CAN GET THAT LOW

02:04:07.773 --> 02:04:09.775
RATE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT AND

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:10.509
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE SPOT

02:04:10.576 --> 02:04:12.144
MARKET.

02:04:12.211 --> 02:04:13.913
YOU'RE PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE.

02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:15.781
NOW RIGHT NOW.

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:19.151
WHAT HAPPENS IS THE I. S. O.?

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:22.154
WILL SAY THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF

02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:23.722
MONEY THAT [inaudible]

02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:25.391
PEOPLE SPENT.

02:04:25.457 --> 02:04:28.194
ON BUYING THIS POWER ON THE OPEN

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.529
MARKET.

02:04:30.596 --> 02:04:32.231
BUT THAT MONEY.

02:04:32.298 --> 02:04:33.833
THEN HAS TO BE DISTRIBUTED BY

02:04:33.899 --> 02:04:35.901
THE C. P. U. C..

02:04:35.968 --> 02:04:38.270
AND WHAT THE C. P. U. C. DOES IS

02:04:38.337 --> 02:04:39.905
IT DOESN'T LOOK AT WHO BOUGHT

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:42.675
THE POWER IT SIMPLY SAYS WHAT

02:04:42.741 --> 02:04:44.009
YOU'RE LOW CHAIR.

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.511
AND IN THE DAY WHEN THEY WERE

02:04:45.578 --> 02:04:47.947
THREE MAJOR UTILITIES AND MAYBE

02:04:48.013 --> 02:04:49.315
THAT MADE SENSE THEY WERE ALL

02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:50.616
PROBABLY BY IN ABOUT THE SAME

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:51.750
AMOUNT.

02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:53.719
NOW WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT LOAD

02:04:53.786 --> 02:04:55.788
SERVING ENTITIES MANY OF WHOM

02:04:55.855 --> 02:04:58.057
WILL BE NEVER ON THAT MARKET AND

02:04:58.123 --> 02:04:59.358
PARTICULARLY THE ONES WHO ARE

02:04:59.425 --> 02:05:01.794
FAIRLY SMALL.

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:03.629
BUT THEY'RE NEVER ON THAT MARKET.

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:05.064
I CAN THINK OF PASADENA IS

02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:07.666
MUNICIPAL UTILITY IT'LL NEVER BE

02:05:07.733 --> 02:05:08.868
ON THAT MARKET.

02:05:08.934 --> 02:05:12.605
SO THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY.

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:14.206
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHO NEEDED TO

02:05:14.273 --> 02:05:15.741
GO ON THE SPOT MARKET SO WITH

02:05:15.808 --> 02:05:17.142

02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:20.579
YOU PAY. FOR WHAT YOU USE.

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:22.248
AND IF YOUR LOAD SERVING ENERGY

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:23.549
THAT JUST BALLOTS IS EVERYTHING

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:25.551
PERFECTLY AS A BELIEVE PASADENA

02:05:25.618 --> 02:05:26.518
DOES.

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:28.220
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:29.588
THOSE EXTRA CHARGES.

02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:30.756
BUT IF YOU'RE LOW CHARITY AN

NEW FORMULA WOULD LIKELY BE

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:21.854
BASED ON THE I. SO CAUSATION

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:26.625

CONCEPTUALLY THE BIG.

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:19.011

02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:33.358
TOTAL COST AND YOU WOULD A

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:36.028
PORTION IT ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:37.663
EACH JEALOUSY IS DRAWING UPON

02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:39.064
THOSE RESOURCES.

02:10:39.131 --> 02:10:40.165
SO INSTEAD OF DOING IT ON A LOW

02:10:40.232 --> 02:10:41.567
CHAIR BASIS YOU DO IT IN

02:10:41.633 --> 02:10:43.635
PROPORTION TO HOW HOW MUCH

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:44.970
THEY'RE ACTUALLY USING THE

02:10:45.037 --> 02:10:46.138
RESORT.

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:48.106
AND THAT CREATES A COST SIGNAL.

02:10:48.173 --> 02:10:49.408
ABOUT THE INDIRECT COSTS DEAL

02:10:49.474 --> 02:10:50.676
SEE IS REALLY PUSHING ON THE

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:52.644
SYSTEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO

02:10:52.711 --> 02:10:53.178
DO THAT.

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:54.913
SO INSTEAD OF A LOW CHAIR AT THE

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:58.050
SPOT MARKET SHARE IT DIDN'T KNOW

02:10:58.116 --> 02:11:02.054
IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A CUT

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.255
CAUSATION IS WHAT THE COULD TURN

02:11:03.322 --> 02:11:04.056
LEAD BETTER AND CUT.

02:11:04.122 --> 02:11:05.657
AND CONCEPT I MEAN IT IT'S IN

02:11:05.724 --> 02:11:06.959
PROPORTION CAUSES THE NEED FOR

02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:09.962
THE RESOURCE THAT THE CRISIS IS

02:11:10.028 --> 02:11:11.430
THE TERM CAUSATION.

02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:15.000
OKAY SO IT'S NOT THE THE TOTAL --

02:11:15.067 --> 02:11:17.169
MEGA WATTS -- PURCHASED ON THIS

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:18.704
THE SPOT MARKET.

02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:21.106
IT WOULD BE THE THE ENERGY THAT

02:11:21.173 --> 02:11:23.709
THE CASE SO -- PULLS FROM THE

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:24.743
INTEGRATION RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:26.144
AVAILABLE TO MATCH SUPPLY AND

02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:29.314

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:32.284
MAKE WHAT HOURS MEGAWATT HOURS.
