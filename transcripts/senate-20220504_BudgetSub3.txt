WHICH WILL TRAINS LOCAL HELP CHORES. CALIFORNIA'S COMMITTEE. PUBLIC HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. HI THIS IS SHIRLEY NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD. ILIO HEY GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- AND SENATOR PAN- SEND YOU PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WHEN WE SAYS THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS JANUARY FUTURE PUBLIC PROPOSAL WE NOTED THAT IT LACKS AN OVERARCHING IT STRATEGY AND SO WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES FILL THAT GAP WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL DOES LOOK PROMISING IT REALLY STARTS THE PROCESS OF MODERNIZING THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH IT INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE WITH THE LEADERSHIP TO THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT DATA AND I. T. NEEDS AND USES- THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE HOWEVER WILL BE KEEP THE LEGISLATURE TO MONITOR OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. I'M SO IN THAT- IN THAT BEING AND WE WILL. FOR LEVEL RATIONS FOR THE LIKE FEATURE WHICH PRIMARILY CONCERNED OVERSIGHT- TO HELP ENSURE THAT THIS- THIS PROPOSAL IS SUCCESSFUL WITHIN OUR FOR CUE SUGGESTIONS RELATED TO SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL SH SO OUR FIRST. QUESTION CONCERNS REPORTING- INTEREST TESTAMENT OF THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH PROPOSAL WE HAD SUGGESTED SEVERAL LAYERS OF REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE FROM IMPLEMENTATION. DATES TO MORE FORMAL ANNUAL UPDATES AND THIRD PARTY MULTI YEAR VIEWS SH WE SUGGEST INCLUDING UPDATES AND INFORMATION ABOUT PROGRESS PROGRESS ON IT MODERNIZATION. IN EACH OF THOSE- I REPORTS SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE ASK FOR THOSE REPORTS JOSH- THE SECOND SUGGESTION CONCERNS- HOW THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER FUTURE I KEEP PROPOSALS SHE SAID THE CURRENT PROPOSAL REALLY LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR AN IT INFRASTRUCTURE AT CDPH. INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE FUTURE PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD FOR. ADDITIONAL IT UPDATES OR NEW I. T. PROJECTS AND WHEN THOSE FUTURE PROPOSALS ARE MADE WE SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE ASKS AND KEEP KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THOSE PROPOSED PROJECTS FIT INTO THE OVER ARCHING- I'M I. T. ECOSYSTEMS AND ABOUT HOW THE PROJECTS WILL BE FUNDED- WE RATE THIS POINT BECAUSE- H. CRIMSON. I T. SYSTEMS AS YOU KNOW HOW IT IS STRICTLY BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE CATEGORICAL NATURE OF GRANT FUNDING. AND LOW STATE HE SYSTEMS CONSEQUENTLY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN SILOS. SO LOOKING AT EVEN ONE PRINT FUNDING. FOR PURPOSE CDPH STILL CONSIDER HOW GIVE PRIDE. IN ALL. I D. FRAME. AND DEVELOP IT MEANS CAN CONSISTENT SUCH AS DATA. AND INNER ALL BUT AND AMONG SYSTEM THE LEGISLATURE WANT ASK ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH EACH I. T. PROPOSED- ARE CAN LOCAL INVOLVEMENT THE B. C. P. NOTES THAT THE PLANNING AND DESIGN INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF HOW LOCAL. THIS WILL USE THE KEY SISTERS AND MISS MOORE DID INDICATE THAT LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE PLANNING DISCUSSIONS. THIS IS VITAL GIVEN THAT STATE SYSTEMS REALLY DEPEND ON LOCAL SYSTEMS AND LOCAL INPUTS TO WORK SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE MAY CONSIDER REQUIRING CDPH TO HAVE THE PLANS THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SUBMIT AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING ONGOING STATE SUPPORT. AS PART OF THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING. LEWD INFORMATION THE STATUS AND ANY CONSISTS OF THEIR OWN I. T. SYSTEMS. AS WELL AS HOW THEY WILL USE- DATA AND ANALYTICS IN THEIR OWN LOCAL STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING- ARE FORCED HIGH LEVEL- SUGGESTION CONCERNS. WHERE SORT OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WILL BE USED TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL IN THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH PROPOSAL WHICH SO BOTH PROPOSALS ARE PROPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH TRIP PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WE WOULD RECOMMEND INSTEAD CODIFYING. OF THESE DETAILS INSTEAD TO BE A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- NEXT WE HAVE JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL SO FIRST WE NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THROUGH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO AUGMENT THE REQUESTED ONE TIME RESOURCES. ONCE ENTERPRISE PLANNING AND STRATEGY DOCUMENTS ARE SUBMITTED TO AND APPROVED BY CAL EACH EACH HAS FEATURED C. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER A REVISION TO THE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE ALSO PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REVIEW THESE DOCUMENTS WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE FRAMEWORK ENVISIONED IN THIS PROPOSAL WILL ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED. AND PART OF THAT REVIEW. IT. FOCUS ON WHICH- ROGER X. ARE MOST TO MODERNIZE THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH. EIGHTY SO FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH IT SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE VITAL RECORDS SYSTEM. MUST REMAIN FUNCTIONAL EVEN WHILE THEY ARE BEING MODERNIZE SPEECH OTHER SYSTEMS HAVE A NUMBER INTERFACES WITH EXTERNAL ENTITIES SUCH AS THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND INTERNAL SMALLER SYSTEMS THAT ARE NEEDED TO OPERATE PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES SH SO THE ENTERPRISING ENTERPRISE PLANNING AND STRATEGY DOCUMENTS SHOULD PROVIDE NOTONLY THE LEVEL OF EFFORT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE IT PROJECTS. BUT ALSO CLEARLY IDENTIFY WHICH PROJECTS ARE MOST CRITICAL AND HOW ANY RISKS WILL BE MITIGATED. OUR SECOND COMMENT- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROPOSES IN THE PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO CONSIDER. QUOTES VERIFIED SATISFACTORY PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION OF INITIATIVES ZERO PLANNING IN THE PROPOSAL SH THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASK HOUSE FINANCE WILL MEASURE THIS PROGRESS AND WHETHER MORE OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF PROGRESS SUCH AS COMPLETION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS. AND OR THE REACHING OF CERTAIN MILESTONES SHOULD BE INCLUDED WITH POTENTIAL NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO JUST TO CONCLUDE THE FRAMEWORK GOALS AND VISIONS OF THIS GROUP AND- THIS PROPOSAL HAVE. SH BUT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND EVALUATES THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRESS TO MAKE SURE THE COMPONENTS OF THE FREE MORE ITS GOALS AND VISION AS WELL AS ANY COMPONENTS THAT ARE ADDED TO IT BY THE LEGISLATURE. ARM BETTER TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL WAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAPMAN'S FOR THAT THE ANALYSIS EXPERIENCE- BUT THESE BIG I. T. PROJECTS THAT THAT HAVE  LOT OF MERIT- BUT THE DEVIL'S ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS- AND I GUESS BACK TO THE BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT- CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR PLAN FOR REPORTING BACK TO US THE PROGRESS. YEAH OPENS THAT YOU ENCOUNTER A WAY. YEAH THANK YOU. YES A WE WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW ALL- ALL THE ALL THE PROCEDURES TO REPORT AFTER CONTROL AGENCIES- AS WE DEVELOP OUR STRATEGIC PLANS IN WITHIN OUR STRATEGIC PLANS WE WILL IDENTIFY KEY PROPORCIONAR HOPE MUST BE ABLE TO FACELOCK AND SHOW PROGRESS ON THESE AS WE MOVE FORWARD- WILL ALSO INCLUDE ARE A LOCAL JURISDICTION PARTNERS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE- PRESSING. THEIR CONCERNS NEEDS FOR DATA AND THEIR TECHNOLOGY GAPS. THE BROKERAGE SORRY AND APOLOGIES I SO IT IS CERTAINLY AS I MAKE EARLIER IN MY TALKING POINTS THAT THERE WOULD BE MULTIPLE PHASES AND SO WITHIN EACH PHASE WE WOULD HAVE KEY MILESTONES TO ENSURE OR A CHEATING ALSO INTERACTIVES LAID OUT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS SO THESE ARE KEY OPPORTUNITIES TO NOT ONLY REPORT OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS AND ALSO THE LEGISLATURE OKAY. AND WE THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD SO WE CAN WE CAN KEEP TRACK OF IT AND NOBODY LIKES THE PROBLEMS AT THE END I KNOW ABOUT CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO INCLUDE AND INVOLVE LOCAL HEALTH AGENCIES IN IN- IN ANALYZING AND SETTING THIS UP AND ALSO PREDICTING THEIR FUTURE NEEDS AMONG. THEN COME ALMOST ANY ELSE I THE IN A- OF STATE PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR LOCAL AGENCIES WHERE. SO MUCH OF THE WORK IS BEING DONE WE TALK WITH MORE ABOUT THAT. YES THE WEEK WE PLAN ON INVOLVING OUR PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS FOR THE STRATEGIC PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ROADMAPS- GATHERING THEIR CONCERNS UNDERSTANDING THEIR ENVIRONMENTS. AND HOW THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ART TECHNOLOGY DATA AFFECT THEM IN AND THEIR NEEDS GEN. IN ADDITION I'M- YEAH I YOU SEE AND PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATICS INSTITUTE I HAVE PROJECTS AROUND DATA MODERNIZATION AND OTHER TOOLS AND RESOURCES. THAT ARE STANDARDIZED SO THESE ARE RESOURCES THAT CDPH CAN SHARE WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH. FIVE SO THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING FROM SIMILAR TEMPLATES AND PROCESSES USED AGAIN THROUGHOUT EACH PHASE. IN THIS MILESTONE IT WILL BEING INCLUDED THAT WE HAVE BENCHMARKS IN INCLUDING CERTAIN TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS OR TOWN HALLS OR IN HI I'M FROM OUR- LOCAL PUBLIC ALL STAKEHOLDERS. YEAH ONE OF OUR BIGGEST GOALS IS TO BE ABLE TO STANDARDIZE OUR TECHNOLOGIES IN OUR INFORMATION IN OUR DATABASE SO IT'S INTEROPERABLE SO WE CAN GET THE- BEST INFORMATION TO. THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO WORK ON. OKAY SHE- AND CAN YOU ADDRESS THE ISSUE OR ABOUT CODIFYING THIS AND HAVING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- I CANNOT AT THIS TIME YEAH. WE WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU I'M NOT. OKAY HI THIS IS SELENA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN GENERAL WE PROPOSE TRAILER BILL WHEN SUCH LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT AND ESTABLISH A PROGRAM TO ALLOCATE FUNDING. IN THIS CASE WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE STEPS TO PROVISIONAL IN WHICH- BUT- WE ARE OPEN TO REVIEWING ANY PROPOSED LANGUAGE AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OKAY. I THINK THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE THE DEFENSE FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO ME- SO WHAT SO IS YOUR DEVELOPING THIS- PLAN FOR IT AGAIN PRE SHEET THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS. IS THIS A THIS IS AN I. T. PLAN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGHOUT THE STATE- THIS IN NINETY PLAN ONLY FOR THE C. PH. SO I WOULD SAY IT'S FULL AT BOTH LEVELS SO WE HAVE TO. THE FRAMEWORKS AND TECHNOLOGIES AT. AGE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE ENTIRE STATE RIGHT- SO OKAY NUMBER WE- GOT INTO SOME SORRY. I AND THAT ACTUALLY WITH THAT IN ORDER MOVING ALONG THE IS YES THANK YOU- SO- SO. THE AND AGAIN PRECIADO PRESENTATION. SO- SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IN. THAT THIS ISN'T JUST AN I. T. EVALUATION OF CDPH AND CERTAINLY FROM HEARING YOUR PRESENTATION AND DURING THE EIGHTEEN STAKEHOLDERS I THINK THE FOLLOW UP WITH BOTH Y. ELIA SAID IN THE CHAIR SAID. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ONE OF WE ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THIS SETTING STANDARDS FOR EXAMPLE FIRST OF COURSE MORE AT MOST IMMEDIATELY LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. RIGHT SO THERE IS SAID SAID IT IS CAN THIS SEAMLESS. BETWEEN LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH I REALIZE YOU ALSO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CDC AND NATIONAL BUT AT LEAST WITH IT. SHOULD WE- INFORMATION IDEALLY- BUILD THE MOVE SEAMLESSLY BETWEEN LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT IS THAT YOU DO AGREE WITH THAT. YES OKAY SO RIGHT SO KNOWS WE HAVE TO SET IT STAND SO AS YOU'RE DEVELOPING THIS WE NEED TO SET IT STANDARDS. WE MAY ALSO NEED TO HOPEFULLY YOUR PLANE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. TRAININGS ALSO- FOR SMALLER COUNTIES PERHAPS ALSO FUNDING SO THAT THEY CAN BE SURE THAT THEIR SYSTEM SO YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO CONSTANTLY. CONNECT WITH THE LEGACY SYSTEM RIGHT THAT WE ACTUALLY GET EVERY. SINGLE OF LOCAL PUBLIC ARE MADE UP TO A CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS AS WELL. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU ENVISION. YES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY PUBLIC HEALTH DOESN'T STAND IN THE SILO ALONE. AND I THINK IT BROUGHT THIS UP BEFORE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE LATER ON WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE H. CHI HER RIGHT AND- THEY THEY- THEY'RE SETTING UP THINGS LIKE- ALL CLAIMS PAYER DATABASES AND- HEALTH EXCHANGES AND SO FORTH. IDEA AND VISION YOUR- YOUR AYE IT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM ACTUALLY IT THING WITH THOSE TYPES OF DATA SAID. YOU CAN EXTRACT PUBLIC HEALTH DATA OUT OF THIS DATA SETS. THAT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE CALL OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT THE REALLY IMPORTANT TO WRITE BECAUSE AGAIN- HOW THINGS GET INTO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM OFTENTIMES ARE TAKING REPORTING FROM HOSPITALS PHYSICIANS OFFICES LABORATORIES AND SO FORTH. RIGHT AND YOU AND YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION BE ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY AND THAT SOMEONE'S FAXING INFORMATION THAT SOMEONE THEN HAS TO MANUALLY ENTER. RIGHT IT TAKES. YOU DON'T WORK FOR IT SAID SAID DELAYS- ETCETERA- SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT THAT AND ACTUALLY I GUESS THE QUESTION IS MAYBE THIS IS BROUGHT IN JUST A PUBLIC HEALTH BUT THAT MAY BE A QUESTION FOR FINANCE WHO ARE WE LOOKING AT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHEN IT COMES TO. YOU KNOW IT TO YOU THIS IS CROSS DEPARTMENTS THAT AND I'VE I'VE ALWAYS SUGGESTED IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THAT IS WE'RE DEVELOPING SOME THESE OTHER IT SYSTEMS THAT INTERSECT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME FORM OF. COMPATIBILITY SO THAT INFORMATION CAN AGAIN FLOW MORE SEAMLESSLY BETWEEN THESE OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS HEALTH DATABASES AND- POLICE FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. YES THIS IS ADAM DANDO AGENCY CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER S. S. G. WESTERN DR PADA TODAY AND WE DID TALK ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR MY OFFICE AND I'M WITH THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION WILL BE DOING EXACTLY THAT WE pAND LOOKING AT THE STANDARDS AND INTEROPERABLE WITH THE IN THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE THIS ENTERPRISE PERSPECTIVE ACROSS ALL OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND EVEN INTERACTING OUTSIDE THE AGENCY ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL. I'M REALLY TO HEAR. BECAUSE AGAIN WITH THIS IS ONE OF THINGS WE LEARNED PANDEMIC WAS THAT INFORMATION COULDN'T FLOW QUICKLY AND OF COURSE THAT CAUSES GAPS IN INFORMATION. THE LASER REPORTING WHICH MEANS THAT LAYS AND BE ABLE TO RESPOND- AND SO FORTH AND- ALSO WE GET A FRANKLY. HUESO SPREAD OUT THE RIGHT WORD BUT IN SOME WAYS IT WAS- OF THE WORK FORCE REGULARS SO BUSINESS NO THEY NEED TO DO THINGS LIKE IMPLEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER AND SO FORTH YET THEY ARE DOING DATA ENTRY. YOU KNOW MANUAL DATA ENTRY BECAUSE THERE WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE DATA ACROSS AND OF COURSE WE STRUGGLE WITH THAT- IT. SO THE I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS THAT AGAIN I CERTAINLY SUPPORT. MUCH OF WHAT- DAILY- SAID SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FOLLOW THROUGH ON. WHAT DO YOU. AND I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS AS- IN THIS DOCUMENT. AT LEAST IN THE BACKGROUND PEOPLE WE GOT AND SO FORTH AND THEN REALIZE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO. WEAR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE SO WE GOT NUMBERS RIGHT HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY POSITIONS HOW MUCH MONEY AND SO FORTH. BUT I GUESS I HAVEN'T HEARD YET- IS. INDEED I REALIZE YOUR PRICE STILL FIGURING IT OUT BUT- IT IS REALLY KIND OF LIKE WHAT THE OVERALL IT STRATEGY IS SO I MEAN WE- WE KIND OF CHARACTERISTICS OF IT- BUT I'M HOPING THAT- YOU CAN HELP- PAINT A PICTURE FOR. US AND- LATER AND- FRANKLY WAS OBVIOUSLY WE NEED PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THIS. OF WHAT WE SEE THIS FUTURE I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE FRAMEWORK IT'S WHAT EVERYONE CALL THIS. IT IS EIGHT WHAT IT'S ABLE TO DO IN THE FUTURE- THAT AND ABOUT WHAT TIME ALL RIGHT WHAT THE TIMELINE IS TO GET THERE. AND SO MAYBE YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT YOU STILL- YOU KNOW COLLECTING INFORMATION OR GETTING FEEDBACK FROM FOLKS BUT I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO IT'S GOT TO GO BEYOND THAT WE NEED DEL EX MORE TWENTY MILLION EIGHTEEN MILLION FIVE. YEAR THREE THREE POSITIONS AND SO FORTH. AND IN THE END SO PEOPLE CAN SAY OKAY THIS IS THE TYPE OF PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. IT SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN THIS IS GOING TO BE ITS CAPABILITIES- IN TERMS OF. FOR I THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND LIKE THIS IS WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IN THE FUTURE DATA COULDN'T DO BEFORE. I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- SO. THE NEW. ALSO CAPACITY SO FORTH BUT REALLY PAINING VERY SOME- A FIVE UP THE IMPORTANCE BUILDING A RIGHT IN WALLS OR AND THINGS- BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AND CONTINUE TO BUILD BROADER PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH UNFORTUNATELY DURING THE PANDEMIC HAS TAKEN QUITE A BEATING SO- IS THE D. WHAT AT WHAT TIME I GUESS I WOULD SAY WHAT AT WHAT TIME FRAME COULD WE- IMAGINE THAT- THAT THE WEATHER TO SEE. CDPH ARE. EVER CAN. PROVIDE US THAT KIND OF- PICTURE. OF WHAT YOU SEE IS THIS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- PUBLIC HEALTH- I. T- TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO. YES NO THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. ESTIMATES ARE THAT WITHIN A YEAR TO YEAR AND A HALF WILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD OVERTURE STRATEGY IN FORWARD WITH- AND AS FAR AS WHAT IT'S GONNA DO. A HIGH LEVEL. BUT IT HE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DATA SCIENCE AND INFORMATICS- WILL REALLY DEVELOP INVOLVING RESPONSIBLE MERGING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION STRATEGIES- THAT DEFINES THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEMS- AND ARCHITECTS THE INTEGRATION OF BETTER DATA PUBLIC THAT TO ME PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS INTELLIGENCE. OPENNESS FRAMEWORKS ENABLE IMPROVEMENTS THAT DATA ACCESSIBILITY QUALITY AND COMPLIANCE. AND YOU KNOW DEVELOP LEVERAGING FOR PURCHASE TO BUILD ENTERPRISE ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE IMPORTANT DATA LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. FROM AN OVERALL STRATEGY AS WELL AND- REALLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT AND KIND OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SORT OF CONDITION OR BODY PART SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH. AND IDEALLY WITH THIS NEW SYSTEM IN PLACE. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO NOT JUST HIGHER POINT IN TIME RETROSPECTIVE DATA MIGHT REALLY BE ABLE TO MODEL AND PREDICT. RIGHT OUT OF TIME SO THAT WE CAN MORE JUDICIOUSLY. WE RESOURCE THIS TO THE APPROPRIATE PLACE AND SOONER AND ANY FASTER AND SO WE GET A STRONG MENTIONED WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF AND WE SHOULD HIGH. ASSESSMENTS AND ARE BASICALLY YOU SENSE OF OUR ROAD MAP OF WHAT THIS SHOULD REALLY LOOK LIKE AND WHERE IT'S GONNA GO. AGAIN AS IT FROM THE THIS REALLY WILL BE A HOLISTIC PLAN TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT. OKAY BUT WITH SO SOUNDS LIKE- AND AGAIN I WON'T BE HERE BUT- I AM SURE- CHAIR EGGMAN AND OTHERS WILL BE HERE- BUT I AS IT IS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING SOME UPDATES AT THE STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADDRESS FROM THE CDPH DIRECTOR NEXT SPRING IN THE STATE'S A YEAR AND A HALF. I HOPE THAT IT'S INCORPORATED INTO THAT THE ADDRESS- IN I GUESS- THAT WOULD BE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF YOU'RE A YEAR AND A HALF- ALIGN- THAT- THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT- YOU CAN- THAT WE CAN GET A FULLER PICTURE OF- I DO APPRECIATE WHEN THINGS THAT YOU SAID BECAUSE IT'S- NOT JUST ABOUT COLLATING DATA AND- SAVE YOU SAYING WHAT HAPPENED. YEAH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST OR EVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE VERY PRESENT ALTHOUGH THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S ALSO USING ANALYTICS MODELING- WE TALK ABOUT A AYE IT'S CETERA TO TRY TO. ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE RIGHT. BOTH NEAR AND FAR AND BE SURE THAT. WE THEN. THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO. FRANKLY PROTECT THE PUBLIC BECAUSE PUBLIC HEALTH IS PUBLIC SAFETY- I MEAN IT'S- I THINK SOMETIMES WE DON'T REALIZE THAT AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU. YOU CAN DOT YOU DIVE A GERM YOU'RE JUST JUST AS YOU DIVE A BULLET. ARE AT- OR SOME OTHER CAUSE. AND AND FRANKLY- IN PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABOUT- TRYING TO PRODUCE YOU KNOW BASICALLY. SAVE LIVES PROLONG OUR LIVES AND ONLY PROLONG LIVES MAKE SURE DOES LIGHT THOSE ADDITIONAL YEARS ARE HEALTHY ONES AND ONES- THAT- PEOPLE- WILL ENJOY AND BE ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THEY WANT. AND SO THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND- WE NEED TO HAVE THE DATA SUPPORTS NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO- I'LL KEEP IN MIND THAT TIMELINE- I REALIZE THINGS HAPPEN- BUT- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. ALTHOUGH I WOULD URGE I KNOW A YEAR AND A HALF- ISN'T NECESSARY IN SOME WAYS IS THAT LONG BUT IT IS A VERY LONG TIME. AND I HOPE. THAT URGE YOU TO TRY TO MOVE TRY TO MOVE IF YOU CAN MOVE IT A LITTLE FURTHER. FASTER THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK THANK YOU. AND AGAIN WE THINK THAT. FOR FOR THEIR TENTS TO THIS AND- UP WITH AN AMBER. PLAN AND WE WILL ALL BE- INTERESTED IN TRACKING THIS GOING. FORWARD AND I BUT I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT- HAS DOES NOT DEPEND HAS HAS- ALLUDED THIS IS LAST THIS. IS LAST TERM HERE.

GUSTS THE TREATMENT OF MAC HEALTH COSTS IN CALCULATING TOTAL COST OF CARE WHICH PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE COST TARGETS. THE BOARD STRUCTURE INCLUDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST STANDARDS AN ANTI TRUST ISSUES THE DATES FOR CITING THE COST TARGETS HEARING FROM OUR HEALTH PLAN PARTNERS ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS FOR THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR CONTRACTING CYCLE.

SO I WILL DO TALK ABOUT THE ADJUSTMENT MADE THE B. C. P. IS THE TO A LOT YOU SEE. LAST YEAR'S BE C. P. AND OF THE READ WE FOR THE OFFICE. WE A PLANNING AND MANAGE SECTOR WILL WHICH WE THINK WILL BE CREDIT TO CORE. POLICY PLANNING AND STATE IN. ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. SO GIVEN THAT THE OFFICE WILL REQUIRE COMPLEX POLICY AND STAKEHOLDER ACTIVITIES ACROSS MANY SECTORS HEALTHCARE ENTITIES AND POLICY AREAS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. DEDICATED ORGANIZATIONAL STAFF TO PROVIDE THESE FUNCTIONS.

INCLUDING STATE IN IN LAST YEAR LANGUAGE. WE'VE ALSO CREATED A WORK FOR AND CARE YOU. WHICH WILL BE ALTAMONT AND PROMOTING HEALTH CARE WORK FOR STABILITY AND MEASURING AND PROMOTING SYSTEM WIDE INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SOME THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A DEDICATED ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS- TO PROVIDE THESE FUNCTIONS. WE ALSO CREATED AND ACQUISITIONS AND MANAGEMENT UNIT- SO GIVEN THE PROGRAM SIZE AND COMPLEXITY WE REASSESS THE ADMINISTRATIVE. TO THE DOCTOR PANTS WHITE- WE HAVE RE. THE MINISTRY OF SUPPORT NEEDED- AND SO CREATED THIS ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT UNIT- WITH- SUFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND IT STAFF TO SUPPORT THIS COMPLEX PROGRAM SO THOSE ARE THE MAJOR CHANGES- IN THE B.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN FIRST ALL I WANT THANK DETER. IN INDUSTRY FOR THE ON GOING COVER THE WAY LOW FORWARD. HAVING AN AGREED UPON- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO FINALLY IMPLEMENT- THIS VERY IMPORTANT OFFICE- THIS YEAR I KNOW OF WE WERE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF LAST YEAR BUT HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR WILL BE THE YEAR. I GUESS THE- QUESTION I HAVE BEEN IN A KNOW THAT- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE CHANGES. IN TERMS OF- THE ANALYTIC CAPACITY OF THE STAFF- IS THERE IS THERE IS TERE A UNIT THAT'S- AND- INCLUDE. WELL- BACK. AND OTHER TYPES TO BE FOR SOME WHAT THE- WHEN THE FUNCTION OF THE OFFICE IS TO DEVELOP THESE RISK ADJUSTERS AND EQUITY ADJUSTERS AND SO FORTH AND- AND ALSO FRANKLY TO MONITOR 2 DEGREES THAT. AS WE IMPLEMENT THOSE HOW- VARIOUS ACTORS WILL RESPOND TO THAT- BUT I THINK FOR MOST PART HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE BEHAVING IN A WAY TO TRY TO IMPROVE EQUITY AND- AND INCREASED FOCUS ON. IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS BUT THERE'S ALSO CERTAINLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO TRY TO GAME THE SYSTEM AS WELL. AND SO BE ABLE TO MONITOR- NO BEHAVIOR LIVING FOR- THAT DOES WELL. USING THE DATA THAT WE HAVE IN OUR OFFICE CLAIMS PAYER DATABASE AND OTHER DATA SOURCES THAT REUSING- SO- AND I STAY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW MEDIC CAL'S- LOOKING AT. SOME OF THIS AS WELL- WHEN IT COMES TO IMPLEMENT TALION AND SO FORTH SO THERE'S PERHAPS SOME. AGENCIA. LEARN THAT COULD TERMS OF- H. KIND THE OFFICE HOW FOR THE WITHIN THE STAFF. IS GOING TO THAT CAN YOU JUST MAYBE. THE ANALYTICAL CAPACITY OF THE STAFF TO ANALYZE ALL THIS DATA THAT THIS OFFICE IS GOING TO BE- THE ONLY HAVING ACCESS TO BE IS GONNA HAVE TO ANALYZE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE TYPES OF. VERY IMPORTANT DECISIONS THE OFFICE IS GOING TO MAKE. OF COURSE AND YOUR FRIEND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I WILL START AND THEN I'LL ASK MS GOT CHRISTMAS TO JOIN- AND ADD ON. A WITH MORE SPECIFICS BUT ABSOLUTELY IN TERMS OF- THERE THERE'S BOTH THE INFORMATION CAPTURE AND THEN I THINK THE KEY IS YOU'RE FOCUSING ON IS THE- IS THE ANALYTICS DONE WITH THE INFORMATION SO. WE AS YOU KNOW- HAVE MANY DECADES OF EXPERIENCE- COLLECTING COMPLICATED DATA AND SO WE DO PLAN TO USE OUR EXISTING INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION. FOR THE IN PART OF. THE DATA IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT'S THE TEAM THAT. HAS LONG CAPTURED. OUR OUR PATIENT LEVEL DATA ON IS. ALL HERE. BASED AND THEN. WE ALL LOOK TO THE TO HELP. THE THIS. DATE ON THE TWO COST CARE ENOUGH DATA THE OFFICE. AND THEN ABSOLUTELY. WE DO HAVE ANALYTICS- STAFF BUILT INTO THE OFFICE OF HEALTH. AFFORDABILITY AUSTIN'S RICHMOND'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS BUT- ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT ABSOLUTELY WE- WILL BE. WORKING CLOSELY WITH MEDIC COW COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND WANT TO MAKE SURE BOTH THAT WE HAVE. CLOSE COLLABORATION TERMS OF THE DATA COMING IN. AND ALSO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA IS USEFUL TO THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE. HEALTHCARE PAYMENTS DATA. SYSTEM WE'RE ALREADY GETTING MEDIC HELP SPEED- WE'VE- HAD- TEACH YES STAFF VERY CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THE BUILD OUT AND INTO SPENT DOING THE SAME. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD A- OF THE ANALYTIC. STAFF AND CAPACITY. YEAH THIS CONGRESS GW DIRECTOR I. JUST SENT TO REPORT CITING. AGAIN AS- ON INDICATED WILL WILL LET. EXIST INCREASE. EXPERTISE FOR DECLARE DATA MAY. SAID AND THEN. YES BILL OUT NEW AND PASS. SPECIFIC TO THE NEED THE NEEDS REQUIREMENTS OF THE- HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM WE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING TO BEAR- TO YOUR POINT DOCTOR. WE HAVE EXPERTISE IN RISK. ADJUSTMENT NOW BUT BASED ON YOU KNOW OVER THE YEARS OF OUTCOME- STUDIES WORK- YOU KNOW THAT. SOMEONE UP LOCAL. LEAVE BUILDING THE PAST YEAR. WAR HELP ECONOMIC YEAH I THINK. THERE ARE- THE NEXT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR- IF HE ON- AND THEN CLEARLY ACT. TO WE NEED TO BUILD OUT AS PART OF A NEW. ANALYTICS TEAM THAT THAT WE PLAN FOR IN IN THE IN THE B. C. B. OKAY CAN SPEAK TO PERHAPS OF THE GALAXY TO GO SAYS SENSE OF CAPACITY SO- HOW MANY. AS WOULD BE RELATED. THIS ALEX WORK. I THINK WE HAVE IT'S I THINK WE HAVE A TWO TEAMS SIX HAVE TO GO AND CONFIRM FOR YOU THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF TO SPEEDING AND WOULD BE AND FULLY GETTING. TO- OGLE WERE WE ALSO HAVE SORT OF COLLABORATION WITH OUR EXISTING TEAMS THAT YOU ARE HEALTH OUTCOMES STUDIES- IN RISK ADJUSTMENT- IN THE WORK THERE SO I THINK WE WILL DO BOTH IN TERMS OF THOSE KINDS OF NEW NUMBERS DEDICATED- BUT- FOCUS ON TEAMING THOSE KINDS OF TWELVE OF- OF. BENEFITS FROM EXISTING- EXISTING WORKERS GOT OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL IT'S A I THINK THE IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF ALL BEING AS WE GET THE STATE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE DAY COLLECTION WHO THEN HAVE. TO CLEAN THE DATA RATE AND SO FORTH SO YOU'RE VERY LARGE DATA SETS AND ENDED IN THE ANALYTICAL PEOPLE I GOT TO BUILD THAT NO PARTS OUT THE DATA ANSWER TO TYPE QUESTION. THAT- POLICYMAKERS NEED TO FINALLY MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT THE THAT THIS OFFICE IS CHARGED WITH SO AND IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT SITES- SO I THINK THIS IS THE THIS PROPOSAL BILL MOUSSA TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION THAT HE IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MONITOR YOU KNOW WEATHER ANALYTICS TEAM IS LARGE ENOUGH FOR NOT AND- AND THEIR CAPACITY TO BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DATA. THERE'S A LOT OF DATA A LOT OF THESE KIND OF MESSY TOO SO THAT ALWAYS MAKES A LITTLE HARDER TO ANALYZE IT CETERA AND BE SURE THAT- THERE'S SUFFICIENT SUPPORT TO MAKE THAT MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO I JUST I'LL PUT A PIN ON THAT SOMETHING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR CERTAINLY FOR US HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I'M SURE YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THAT. AND THEN OF COURSE AS YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW EVERY OTHER WORK GOING ON AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCE IN OR DOING OTHER PROJECTS TEAMMATES CD EIGHT CS OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL AS.

THANK THANK YOU- IN NOW MOVING TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE VERY EXCITING ISSUE I- AND AGAIN THANKS SO. OF TALK PAN- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A THIS IS FOR REDUCING THE COST OF INSULIN THE CAL ARE REX PROGRAM THE BIOSIMILAR INSULIN INITIATIVE AND WE HAVE WITH US BUT CHAU GHANI ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND BE ABLE DAVID TAFELBERG PROJECT MANAGER FOR CALORIE R. ACTS AS WELL AS RAIN BUCKLEY CHIEF COUNSEL FOR HOOKER H. CHI WELCOME AND PLEASE PROCEED. WELCOME GOOD MORNING TURN INTO POUND. BEFORE GETTING INTO THIS BUT OF THE APRIL ON PROPOSAL I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SENATE BILL EIGHT FIVE TWO- ENACTED IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WHICH CAUGHT UP BY THE COLLAR X. PROGRAM. BUT ONE REQUIREMENT UNDRESSED FIVE TWO IS THAT PARTNERSHIPS FOR GENERIC MANUFACTURING. INCLUDE THE PRODUCTION ABOUT LEAST ONE FORM OF DENZEL AND PROVIDED A VIABLE PATHWAY. FOR MANUFACTURING MORE AFFORDABLE FORM OF INSULIN EXCESS. AS WIDELY DOCUMENT- THE INSULIN MARKET AS LONG THE PIT MAIS THE MARKET FAILURES PLAGUED THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. THIS HAS RESULTED IN KEEPING INSULIN PRICES HIGHER AND DIRECTLY HARMING CALIFORNIA AND ITS RESIDENTS. PARTICULARLY OR UNDERINSURED DIABETICS OFTENTIMES PAY HIGH PRICES FOR THEIR INSULIN SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR SHOW FOR THEIR LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS. BASED ON NATIONAL DATA AS MANY AS ONE FOR DIABETICS CANNOT AFFORD THEIR INSULIN AND THUS RATIONED FOR US SHE'S TAKING INSULIN ALTOGETHER. THE STATE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO REMEDY THIS MARKET FAILURE BY BRINGING MORE AFFORDABLE BIOSIMILAR INSULINS TO CALIFORNIA. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED PARTNERSHIPS UNDER SB EIGHT FIVE TWO. BY MESSING FIFTY MILLION INTO BIOSIMILAR INSULIN DEVELOPMENT WITH THE CONTRACTOR OUT ACCORDING TO A MILESTONE PAYMENT SCHEDULE. THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD ONLY MAKE PAYMENTS ACCORDING TO CHIEF MEN OF CONCRETE MILESTONES SUCH AS INITIATIONOF CLINICAL TRIALS- REACHING CLINICAL ENDPOINTS OF A CLINICAL- REACHING PRIMARY END POINTS OF CLINICAL TRIALS. M. AND PROCUREMENT OF HANDLE EVERY DEVICES AND FDA APPROVAL AND INTERCHANGE ABILITY RATINGS. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO INVEST AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION. TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CALIFORNIA BASED MANUFACTURING FACILITY. WHICH WOULD PROVIDE THE ADDED BENEFIT OF HIGH SKILLED HIGH PAYING JOBS WITHIN THE STATE. THIS FACILITY WOULD BE AT A LOCATION JOINTLY DETERMINE BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CONTRACTOR. KELLY JAY US WILL PARTNER WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LEVERAGING ITS EXPERTISE IN BUSINESS INVESTMENT. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SERVICES SUCH AS SIDE RUBIO PERMANENT SUBSTANCE AND OTHER RELATED ACTIVITIES. CALLIE JUDGE US WILL LEAN ON GO BUSINESS EXPERTISE TO MITIGATE REST IMPROPERLY DELIVER ON THE PROPOSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY DRUG DEVELOPMENT PAYMENTS WOULD ONLY BE MADE FOR REACHING CERTAIN STAGES SUCH AS SITE SELECTION AND DOCUMENTED PURCHASES OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL COUNTERACTS WITH IDENTIFIER PARTNER TO BRING TO MARKET LOW COST INTERCHANGEABLE BIOSIMILAR INSULINS. WITH THE GOAL O PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH ACCESS TO INSULIN PRODUCTS THAT ARE A FRACTION OF THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER VIAL. WEST PRICES CURRENTLY CHARGED BY INSULIN MANUFACTURERS. INJECTING SUCH STEEP PRICE COMPETITION WOULD DISRUPT THE CURRENT MARKET AND EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S DIABETICS. IN ADDITION TO THE CONSUMER SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW PRICED CALAR EXPIRE BIOSIMILAR INSULINS THE STATE'S SIX THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS AS PART OF A POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP THIS MEANS CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE A PRIOR OF SUPPLY SO THAT THE STATE'S VOLUME MADE VOLUME NEEDS ARE MET. HOWEVER NO MINIMUM VOLUME COMMITMENT WOULD APPLY TO THE STATE. SECONDLY BRANDING CAL CARRICK'S INSULIN PRODUCTS FOR WHAT WOULD BE CALIFORNIA WILL BE LABELED WHAT CALIFORNIA RELATED LABELING. SUCH AS A- CAL GOLDEN BEAR LOGO OR VERBIAGE THAT SAYS CALAR EXPENSE LINE BROUGHT YOU BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS A HIGHLY UTILIZED DRUGS DOES LABELING WILL CREATE BRAND AWARENESS AMONG STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATE THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING LOW COST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THIRD WE SEEK LOW COST IMPLEMENTATION WHERE DIRECT MANUFACTURING IN WHICH THE STATE ITSELF WITHOUT TOTAL OWNERSHIP OF FACILITIES AND THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO USERS TO USE CONTRACT MANUFACTURING THIS APPROACH IS THE LOWEST COST LOWEST RISK AND MOST ADMINISTRATOR AT LEVI'S I'VE FOUGHT. FOR THE STATE TO BRING A PORTABLE BIOSIMILAR INSULINS TO MARKET THE STATE WOULD REQUIRE THE CONTRACT MANUFACTURER TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCT ROLLOUT IN DISTRIBUTION. SO THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS. THE PRODUCTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE THROUGH A VARIETY OF RETAILERS PHARMACIES AND OTHER OUTLETS AS WELL AS MAIL ORDER PHARMACY. TO QUICKLY EVACUATE IN AGREEMENT WITH A CONTRACT MANUFACTURER. STATUTORY CHANGES ARE ALSO PROPOSED THAT WOULD PROVIDE CONTRACT EXEMPTION AUTHORITY FOR H. FIVE THE IMPLEMENTING DEPARTMENT FOR CALAR ACTS THIS CONTRACT EXEMPTION WOULD ENABLE THE QUICKEST PATH. FOR CONSUMERS TO ACCESS BIOSIMILAR INSULINS IN THE FUTURE CALAR ACTS COULD ALSO INTRACTABLE INTO PARTNERSHIPS FOR OTHER DRUGS IT'S EXPERIENCING MARKET FAILURES BESIDES INSULIN. BRINGING HELLO SINCE WHEN THE MARKET REFLECTS THE PRIORITIES OF BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. THIS MEANS BEARINGS TO BE UNINSURED UNDERINSURED AND THOSE WITH HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLANS- AS THESE CONSUMERS ARE EXPOSED TO HIGH LIST PRICES. AS WELL AS TO HELP PLANS YOU CAN OBTAIN A LOWER PRICE AND SO ON THAN WHAT THEY CURRENTLY GET AND NOT PRICES AFTER PHARMACY REBATES. ADDITIONAL SAVINGS TO THE BROADER BROADER MARKET- CAN OCCUR IF OVER TIME THE BRANDED INSULIN MARKET MAKERS TO LOWER THEIR PRICES IN RESPONSE. FOR PATIENT HELP THERE WOULD BE INCREASED ADHERENCE TO INSULIN REGIMENS THEREBY IMPROVING THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF DIABETICS AND ELIMINATING ADVERSE EVENTS RATIONING SUCH AS DIABETES KETOACIDOSIS. IN CLOSING STATEMENT GENERIC MANUFACTURING REPORT INSULIN WILL PROVIDE RELIEF FOR MILLIONS OF DIABETICS AND GENERATE SYSTEM WIDE SAVINGS AND ADVANCE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES A AND OUTCOMES EXPERIENCED BY THOSE WITH DIABETES. THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AND I'M HAPPY WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THAT'S JUST ALSO FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE NOTICED ALL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OKAY ILIO. THANK YOU THE CHRISTIAN MORROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE AND OFFICE- WE'RE GOING TO FIRST NOTE THAT IF THE PROPOSAL IS SUCCESSFUL AT REDUCING THE COST OF INSULIN THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO THE STATE AND ITS RESIDENTS. PROBABLY NOT THIS WOULD BE A FAIRLY LARGE INVESTMENT- ONE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND ONE TIME WHICH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX- BEN. THE STATE WOULD LIKELY NEED TO WORK WITH A PARTNER THAT DOES NOT TO HAPPEN I WAS OVER IN A IN SOME PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET WE NEED AT FDA- NEEDS TO DETERMINE THAT THE INSULIN IS NOT MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUSLY APPROVED INSULIN PRODUCTS AND THAT PHARMACIES CAN SWITCH OUT BRANDON INSULIN PRESCRIPTIONS WITH THE PRODUCT BRINGS A PRODUCT TO HAS BECOME MORE STREET AND WE YEARS BUT IT STILL CARRIES CHALLENGES. I WANT TO PROVE AND PRODUCE THEIR COULD ALL BE TOM TO THE PRO IS A TO CONSUMER. AS SUCH IT IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE STATE'S. AND LONG TERM INTEREST OF CORPORATE. THE NEW IN. THAT THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDING TO THE CONTRACTED FORMER WOULD BE TIED TO IT IN CERTAIN MILESTONES. HOWEVER DETAILS ON WHAT THESE MILESTONES WOULD BE HAVE NOT PROVIDED AT THIS TIME. AND LONGER TERM WHAT THE CONTRACT A PLUMBER HAS RECEIVED THE FULL AMOUNT OF FUNDING IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT LEVERAGES STATE WOULD HAVE TO PROTECT. TRAVIS WHAT THE MINISTRY HAS TO THAT IN TO GO. THE PARTNERSHIP BEYOND THE FUNDING. TO KEEP PRICES LOW. THE STRUCTURE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP REMAINS UNCLEAR. AND POTENTIALLY COULD CREATE ADDITIONAL LEGAL LIABILITIES FOR THE STATE. WE ALSO FIND THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT. BUILT INTO THIS PROPOSAL IN THE MINISTRATION HAS STATED THAT IT INTENDS TO WORK AS A CONSOLE INTO MY THE CONTRACTED PARTNERS PROGRESS. BUT THIS INFORMATION WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC OR TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT IS FOR THE COMPOUNDED BY. A QUEST FOR AN EXEMPTION FROM THE STATE'S CONTRACTING RULES THE TWENTY TWO. THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE PARTNERSHIP COULD JUST FIND EXTENSION PROJECT CONTRACTING. POWER IS UNCLEAR WHY THE X. EXTENDING THIS EXEMPTION IS NOT NEEDED BEYOND THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX PERIOD WHEN THE FUNDING WHICH WINDOW EXPIRES. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL- PRIOR TO THE STATE ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT FIRST REQUIRED ADMINISTRATION LIVE FOR THE NIGHT LIST OF MILESTONES THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT. YOU COULDN'T STEPS FOR PROVIDING A VIABLE PATH TO FDA APPROVAL. SECOND REQUIRE PROVISIONS STATE CAUGHT IN THE CONTRACT TO PRINT THE STATE DIRECTOR PURCHASED INSULIN COSTS AT LEAST UNTIL STATE SAVINGS EXCEED THE STATE INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP. IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IN THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T ACTUALLY SPECIFY WHAT THE PRICE WOULD BE FOR THE INCIDENT PRODUCT AND THAT LIKELY WOULD NOT BE DETERMINED UNTIL THEY ARE FULLY A PER IN THE- THAT PROVIDES FOR PENALTIES IN IF THE CONTRACT. FAILS TO MEET THE OF THE CAR. TO ENSURE THE STATE INTERESTS PROTECT. FOURTH WE RECOMMEND REQUIRED A REVIEW BY CAN. SUCH AS THE GENERAL OF THE CONTRACT LANGUAGE FOLLOWING. THE NEGOTIATION WITH THE POTENTIAL HARPER BUT BEFORE THE CONTRACT IS ENTERED INTO. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON SHOWING THEIR PROVISIONS FOR THAT FACT THE STATE'S INTEREST AND MINIMIZE LIABILITY. IT WE RECOMMEND TAKING THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDING. ON A THIRTY DAY REVIEW PERIOD BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. OF THE CONTRACT TERMS OF MILESTONES. AND SIX RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT THE CONTRACTED PARVO DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO RAISE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO COVER ANY REMAINING POTS. ASIDE FROM THE STATE'S INVESTMENT TO BRING IT THE INSULIN PRODUCT MARKET. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ADMINISTRATION HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNT WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO. BRING AN INSULIN PRODUCT TO MARKET AND SELL CONTACTED FORMER WOULD NEED- SEPARATE. ONE THE CONTRACT IS ENTER INTO RECOMMENDED THE LESS RICK QUARTERLY UPDATES BETWEEN BUDGET COMMITTEE ON PROGRESS TOWARDS A CONTRACT MILESTONES TO ENSURE SOME LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN CREATING OFTEN COMPLEX SPATIAL PROVIDE ANY NECESSARY OVERSIGHT. FINALLY WELL THE NEED NATURE THE- CONTRACTUAL PARTNERSHIP AS WELL THE STATE IS R. TO BRING UP. THE FILE SIMILAR. TO MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER OR- PROVIDE SOME RATIONALE FOR BY AN EXTENSION TO THE CONTRACTING RULES GOING TO FORGET ABOUT PAIN. IN THE PRODUCT- TO ENTER THE MARKET PLACE THE LITERATURE MIGHT WISH TO ASPEN OF THE BENEFITS AND TRADE OFFS OF ITS PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE TO EXEMPTION STATE CONTRACTING RULES THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY TWO AS OPPOSED TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. OF MR REGARDING CAN YOU SPEAK PLEASE TO THE NEED FOR THE EXTENDED CONTRACT. THROUGH THIRTY TWO VERSUS JUST TWENTY FIVE. DR EGGMAN ALTERNATE OVER TO RUN ABOUT THEIR CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER BUCKLEY YEAH MORNING- THE EXAM NEEDED BECAUSE THE AGREEMENTS WITH CONTRACTING. WILL UNUSUAL CONTRACTS THAT DON'T SQUARELY FITS SQUARELY WITHIN DDS IS CURRENT RULES AND PROCEDURES. UNLIKE TYPICAL CONTRACTS STATES NOT DIRECTLY RECEIVING GOODS OR SERVICES AND CONTRACTS OF THE PERFORMED IN THE CONTEXT OF A HIGHLY REGULATED COMPLEX INDUSTRY. BECAUSE OF THIS UNIQUENESS IS AGREEMENT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR REVIEW UNDER NORMAL ONTRACTING PROCESSES. WHICH MAY CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL WASTE. THE TEN YEARS IS. IF THE PART AGREEMENT FOR CONSOLE HAS TO BE. BEYOND YEARS BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTED CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR NEXT ENTER YOUR- OTHER DRUGS ARE EXPERIENCING MARKET FAILURES BESIDES INSULIN AND SO IF WE TRY TO RESPOND TO DEVELOPMENTS EITHER- IN THIS PROGRAM ARE IN THE MARKET IN GENERAL- THE CONTRACT EXEMPTION WOULD ALLOW US TO QUICKLY RETAIN- EXPERTS AND CONSULTANTS TO ASSESS THAT- MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. TO THEM AS MR BURKE IS THAT IS IN BAD IN YOUR RESPONSE. ALSO THE REASON WHY WE DON'T SEE MORE MILESTONES AND- TRANSPARENCY WITH UPDATES- OUR THAT IS GOOD DEVELOPING A SPECIFIC MILESTONES ALSO CAN REQUIRED- WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MILESTONES FIT WITHIN THE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AND THAT IN THE CONTRACT WE ARE PROPERLY DOCUMENTED WHAT WILL HAVE TO BE A APPROVING UP TO ESTABLISH THE MILESTONES THAT MET. BEFORE THE MONEY GOES OUT. SO THE INTENTION IS TO ESTABLISH THOSE BEFORE BEFORE THE STATE ENTERS INTO A CONTRACT. YES BABY MILESTONES WOULD BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE THAT AND CAREFULLY DOCUMENTED IN THE CONTRACT ITSELF. OKAY AND WHAT ABOUT QUARTER QUARTERLY UPDATES TO THE LEGISLATURE- I DON'T SEE WHY DOES THIS COULDN'T BE DONE OKAY. BUT IT'S TO SO WE ALL IN IN THEIR A CERTAIN. TO THIS- BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE SAYING IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS THAT WE'RE ENTERING INTO- IN A IN A VOLATILE SOMEWHAT. MARKET IF YOU WILL AGE WITH PHARMACEUTICALS. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO WHEN CAN WE EXPECT MORE INFORMATION- WORK CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW TRYING TO RETAIN EXPERT COUNCIL- WITH WITH- TRONG- EXPERIENCING CONNECTIONS IN LIFE SCIENCES- SO BE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. OKAY BECAUSE- WE ARE ALL. VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL BUT I'M BUT I'M SURE ALL OF US HAVE THEM YOU KNOW HAVE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH CONTRACTING AND TRANSPARENCY AND HOLDING- HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WHO FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES THEY THEY SEE CALIFORNIAN THEY SEE IT AS A AS A AS A GIANT ATM MACHINE- WITHOUT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE I KNOW WE'RE CLOSING THE VOLUNTEER LAB. IN QUIETLY KIND OF AS WE SPEAK HERE- AND AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING INTO ANOTHER BIG MASSIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT THAT AGAIN WE ALL AGREE THE OF THE GOALS ARE REALLY GOOD- BUT AGAIN THE DEVIL IS ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS SO I THINK WE'LL BE HAVING A LOT MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AS WERE THOSE YOU'RE ESTABLISHING- THE CONSULTANT AND- BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF UNKNOWNS- WITH A- WITH A VERY BIG PRICE TAG. THIRTY FIFTH. THANK YOU AND- ACTUALLY A DAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MONTH TO CLARIFY I THINK SOME VERY IMPORTANT POINTS HERE- SO FIRST OF ALL I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- ACTUALLY- ARE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE PASSED SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO WHICH IS THE FOLLOW UP A BILL TO TALK ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION SO I THINK THAT WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TRAILER BILL AND TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVE. WELL THINGS I WANTED TO BUILD AND- PERHAPS- MINISTRATION CAN YOU CAN ADDRESS THIS IS THAT- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE I KNOW WE TALKED SO- SOME STREET. TALK TO- THE- THAT WERE WORKING YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE THIS CONTRACT SO FORTH BUT I THINK MORE ACCURATELY. BECAUSE NOW MY ORIGINAL LEGISLATION WHICH WE REFER TO- YOU KNOW TALKED ABOUT THE STATE DURING THE MANUFACTURING ITSELF NOW. THE CHALLENGE THERE IS OF COURSE- OUR STATE DOESN'T HAVE EXPERIENCE. DRUG MANUFACTURERS IS AGAIN A HIGHLY COMPLEX HIGHLY REGULATED- IN THE ENDEAVOR HERE UNITED STATES FOR APPROPRIATE REASONS FOR PATIENT SAFETY AND SO FORTH. AND SO THE STRATEGY NOW IS TO FIND A PARTNER. BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE WORD PARTNER OKAY AND THEN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT SIMPLY A CONTRACT RIGHT OKAY SO WE HAVE SOME MONEY WE CONTRACT AND SOMEONE ELSE IS GONNA GO MANUFACTURE DRUGS BUT THAT. ACTUALLY WERE FORMING A PARTNERSHIP IN FACT THE STATE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A GOVERNMENT STAKE. IN EXCHANGE FOR PART OF IT THE FUNDING. SO THAT- WEEK SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE HAVE A- CONTRACT AND IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE CONTRACT WILL TAKE YOU TO COURT OR WHATEVER ELSE WITH OLD MONEY BUT- WE ACTUALLY HAVE. AT LEAST SOME SAY IN DECISIONS BEING MADE BY THE COUNTRY THE ENTITY BECAUSE A PARTNERSHIP. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY OF A SAY IN. ENTITY IN TERMS OF THEIR- OPERATIONS AND DECISION MAKING IS. IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT MAYBE MORE AT THE- AS THE ATTORNEY ALWAYS. CAUTION WITH THE USE OF PARTNERSHIP WITH MORE OF IT AND INVESTMENTS OF WHERE I WAS FAT INVESTMENT WOULD COME- PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNANCE AND TO BE ABLE TO- TRY TO YOU KNOW STEER HOW THAT INVESTMENT IS UTILIZED. RIGHT SO IN OTHER WORDS WE WEEK WE DO ACTUALLY OF- YEAR AGAIN OBVIOUSLY IS THAT THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WERE DIFFERENT AS A DIFFERENT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT I THINK SUPPORT HAVE REPORTS AND SO FORTH. BUT THE STATE ITSELF AS A WHOLE IS AN ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY. WILL HELP MAKE INVESTMENT IT'S NOT MERELY A CONTRACT WHERE WE'RE SAYING OKAY WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE FIFTY MILLION GIVE US HOW MANY VIALS OF INSULIN RIGHT. IT'S AND IT'S AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP INVESTMENTS- OF COURSE THIS FIRST WITH INSULIN BUT IS ALSO PRESENTED TO DEFY OTHER DRUGS WHERE. WE WOULD ACTUALLY AS AN INVESTOR HAVE A SAY AS TO WHICH ONES ARE MOST IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA AND STEER THE DIRECTION. OF THE OF THE- OF THIS ENTITY. TO TOWARD OUR PRIORITIES. IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S IN FOR OBVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW THE STATE'S LEVERAGING STEERING THE PROGRAMMER THIS THIS PROJECT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WOULD BE RELATIVE TO THE TO THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT A SLIGHTLY SURE AND- AND OUR STAND. WELL WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT CONTROLLING STAKE WE'RE MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT WOULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL SAY. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. I DID I DID SO IT IS SO- I DO THINK THAT AGAIN WITH THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE STATE ACTUALLY MANY FACTIONS ON ACTUALLY THIS IS THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A- HYBRID APPROACH BUT I MEAN THIS ISN'T ANYWAY. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE'RE PARTNERING WITH AN ENTITY TO HAS EXPERIENCE. RIGHT BECAUSE- ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WE NEED THAT EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE RIGHT- WE CAN JUST GET THAT FROM CONSULTANTS- WE HAVE ACTUALLY OTHER INVESTORS THAT LEVERAGES OUR MONEY. RIGHT SO IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO DO THIS ON BY OURSELVES. BUT WE'RE ALSO LEVERAGING OTHER INVESTORS AND ALSO- THE POTENTIAL OF COURSE OF- THE MARKET YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE A LARGER MARKET RATE BECAUSE OTHER INVESTORS ARE NOT JUST INTO IN CALIFORNIA. I MEAN THIS IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO MARKET THESE- THESE GENERIC MEDICATIONS STARTING WITH INSULIN- ACTUALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT- AND- AND OF COURSE WE FEEL. IN IN IN THE CONTRACT PART- WE'RE GONNA SET GROUND RULES FOR THIS INVESTMENT RIGHT ENSURING THAT. YEAH THIS IS AT COSTS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT AND SO FORTH AND THAT- AND AT THE CHIEF'S OF. BILLS THAT THAT WE SEE. IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY SO TO ME I'M CERTAINLY I. NOW THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT- PERHAPS ALSO. SOMETHING THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT PERHAPS NEED TO BE. MORE CLARIFIED TO THE LEGISLATURE- BUT BUT I ACTUALLY THINK. IN SOME WAYS- GIVEN THE NATURE OF HOW WE'RE STRUCTURING THIS AND INVESTMENT AND RECOGNIZING WE ARE WE ARE VENTURING INTO. A THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT. IN TERMS OF- ACTUALLY BEING A L. PARTICIPANT AND THIS- VIED SAID KIND OF A DIFFERENT FORM OF OVERSIGHT. AS WELL THAT. WILL ACTUALLY BE BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE THAT IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE VISION OF WHAT WE WANTED WHEN I AUTHORED PREVIOUS BILL AND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET. THAT THIS REALLY IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION IT'S NOT NOT MERELY- WELL WE- I JUST GOT A CONTRACT THIS ALL OUT BUT ACTUALLY WE'RE PARTNERING WITH PEOPLE MAKING AN INVESTMENT TO AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE IN A POSITION AND ALL OF THIS. IN WHAT COMES OUT TO OF COURSE NOT ONLY DO INSULIN WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WILL WAS A PRIORITY- BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS OTHER- MEDICATIONS OR DRUGS- WHERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE MARKET FAILURES BUT TO ADD TO IT. BUT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE- AFFORDABLE AND ALSO A RELIABLE SUPPLY OF MEDICATIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MOVING TOWARD- TO DO- CREATE THE WORK OF THE MINISTRATION- WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS- THEY'LL CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT L. A. O. SAID IN TERMS OF BEING YOU KNOW HAVING MORE INFORMATION BEING SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT PERHAPS SOME OF THE DETAILS- NOW MILESTONES AND SO FORTH ALSO READ RECOGNIZING THAT. NOW THIS IS- IS SOMEWHAT CUT YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S A COMPLEX MARKET THERE'S A LOT OF REGULATIONS THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS IN OUR VANTAGE SOMEPLACE- MAY MAKE IT A LITTLE SLOWER THAN WE'D LIKE IT TO MOVE ALONG BECAUSE WE DON'T CONTROL THAT FTA OTHERS. OTHERS DO BUT BUT ALSO SHARES- THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND LET'S SAY TYPICAL CONTRACT WOULD SO I KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE TO GET A LITTLE NERVOUS WELL WHO'S WATCHING WHO'S WHO'S WATCHING THINGS BUT- THAT THERE ARE GONNA BE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF OVERSIGHT. I THINK IN THIS PROPOSAL THAT- PERHAPS WOULDN'T EXIST AND SOME OTHER TYPES OF CONTRACTS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT IT IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SPEAK TO THAT- IN TERMS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S POINT OF VIEW. BUT YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL STRUCK. OF HOW WE WILL HAVE TO BE WITH OUR- COUNT. IN SEE HOW TO HAVE BEST INCORPORATE THAT. GIVEN THE- CARE STRUCTURE WHATEVER PARTNER OR PARTNERS THAT THAT WE END UP WORKING WITH. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND AGAIN WE- WILL BE THINKING DR PEPPER'S LEADERSHIP IN THIS AIRSPACE FOR YEARS TO COME ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LOWER COST INSULIN HITS THE MARKET.

WELL TRY AND I DO CLERK PROVIDERS THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY. MISKIN DOLLAR. WITH INIESTA BECAUSE- BUT MORNING. MORE MY NAME IS REBECCA GETS ALL NEVER NOW ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL CALIFORNIANS. AND WE REPRESENTS WORKER WITH THE G. IN SOCIAL FROM AN- SCHOOL SOCIAL WORK I WOULD LIKE TO MY CELL ALSO WITH THE AND PANEL. BUT ESPECIALLY COLLINS WITH HELP CYCLE. ASSOCIATION AS WE ARE A PARTNER INTHE TWO ONE ONE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE LICENSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. IN ADDITION TO THE LICENSE WORKFORCE MSW LEVEL SOCIAL WORKER ARE CRITICAL STAFF FOR DELIVERING SERVICES. ACROSS MANY DIVERSE SECTORS AND PROGRAMS THAT IMPACT VIRTUALLY EVERY CALIFORNIA. M.S. W. LEVEL STAFF ARE CRITICAL IN SERVING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IMPACTED BY POVERTY ABUSE AND NEGLECT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. THIS INCLUDES MANY PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMS IN CHILD WELFARE FOSTER CARE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES EDUCATION OSPITALS SCHOOL. BASED SETTINGS AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. RECENT INVEST IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND CHILD WELFARE AND MENTAL PROTECTIVE SERVICES HAVE INCREASED DEMAND FOR NSW TRAINS SOCIAL WORK STAFF ACROSS PUBLIC AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS. DESPITE THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR NSW LEVEL PROFESSIONALS AS WELL AS THE INTEREST FROM STUDENTS IN PURSUING SOCIAL WORK PROGRAMS THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO FEW SOCIAL WORKERS COMING THROUGH THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 80% S. B. S. YOU AND UC MSW PROGRAMS REPORT THE NEED TO EXPAND CURRENT CAPACITY TO ADMIT MORE QUALIFIED APPLICANTS ONE EXAMPLE FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS CSU LONG BEACH HAS RECEIVED AN AVERAGE. OF TWELVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS TO ITS MSW PROGRAM I CAN ONLY ACCOMMODATE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS. BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF MSW DEGREES BEING OFFERED THERE IS FIERCE COMPETITION ACROSS GOVERNMENTAL AND NON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR NSW'S. ADDITIONALLY THE PIPELINE DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CONTINUOUSLY ENGAGE AND SUSTAIN STUDENTS WHO REPRESENT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS OF COLOR AND THOSE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES. CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUES TO BECOME MORE DIVERSE AND THE POPULATION SERVED BY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. CONSUMERS OF THE SERVICE. SINCE EXPRESS IT IS I ARE TO BE SERVED BY SOCIAL WORKERS WHO REFLECT THE POPULATION SIR I'M THE PROPOSAL I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT IS THE BILL CAPACITY FOR MASTERS OF SOCIAL WORK PROGRAMS AND IS COSPONSORED BY ANY US W. CALIFORNIA THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATIONSEIU AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF DEANS AND DIRECTORS OF SOCIAL WORK. I WILL DO THE FOLLOWING ONE REQUIRE THE SECRETARY OF CAL HHS IN CONSULTATION WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OF THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EXPANDING NSW CAPACITY. IN THE CSU AND UC SYSTEM. TWO PENDING THE COMPLETION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IT WOULD ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM AS A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION STATE CHAMP ARE ALL SIGNS PER YEAR IN THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS AVAILABLE THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO DO THE FOLLOWING. I PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION PER YEAR TO BE USED TO SEE FUNDING FOR GRANTS TO IMMEDIATELY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF MSW STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF SOCIAL WORK. TO PROVIDE A FIFTEEN MILLION PER YEAR TO INCREASE SUPPORT TO COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTY AGENCIES OFFERING FILLED INTERNSHIPS TO SUPPORT THE REQUIRED NINE HUNDRED HOURS BILLED PRACTICUM FOR ALL NSW STUDENTS. AND PROVIDE THIRTEEN MILLION PER YEAR EDUCATIONAL STIPENDS TO MSW STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. IN SUMMARY THIS PROPOSAL WILL BENEFIT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS WELL AS OTHER WORKPLACES AND SOCIAL WORKERS ARTISTS FINANCIAL WORKFORCE IN SO MANY SYSTEMS THE MORE SOCIAL WORKERS WE GET THROUGH THE EDUCATIONAL PIPELINE THE MORE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL WORKPLACES INCLUDING. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND REPUBLICAN DOES YOU SEE THIS ADDITION WHAT THE WHAT THE IS ALREADY- THE WORK THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY DONE AND HAS PLANNED OUT HERE IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT ABSOLUTELY OKAY- AND YOU CAN GET AT THE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I KEEP TALKING ABOUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS. GRADUATE SOCIAL PROGRAMS HAVE SHRUNK AROUND THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME ARE THE DEMAND HAS EXPONENTIALLY GROWN- AND SO THERE SEEMS TO BE A REAL DISCONNECT. BETWEEN OUR ARE EDUCATING PARTNERS AND- AND THE NEEDS RIGHT NOW- THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I THINK OR WE DON'T WE DON'T TACKLE THIS- SO I WOULD SUPPORT THAT- MR FOREST CAN YOU YOU AND IN THE NSW ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER AND I KNOW SENATOR WIENER ALSO HAS A PLAN THAT HE'S WORKING ON WITH THAT THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE THERE'S THAT LEGISLATION GOING THROUGH REALLY AND REALLY BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO LICENSURE BECAUSE I ARE WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING THEIR DEGREE BUT THEN SOMETIMES A BARRIERS TO LICENSURE AND PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO PRACTICE WITH THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR LICENSE- ARE YOU PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. YES WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH FIBER CONSITUTES GBH TA AND OTHER FOLKS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE ON. COLLISION ASK- THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS- THAT ORGANIZATION DOES HAVE ABOUT SOME OF THE- ISSUES WITH. PRACTICING TO THE FULL SCOPE OF LICENSURE WITH SOME OF THE LANGUAGE- SPECIFICALLY CONTAINS SANDERS S. B. NINE SIX FOUR- BUT AS A COALITION WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE PATHWAYS. TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO THE MARKET FOR OUR LICENSEES- SO I DID REFERENCE IN MY SPEECH- THREE MONTHS WAIT TIME. FOR MY FOLKS WHO ARE WAITING TO GET LICENSURE. I SPECIFICALLY BORDER PSYCHOLOGY. AND I WILL GET SOME CREDIT FOR PSYCHOLOGY HAS BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON BRING THAT NUMBER DOWN BUT- YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD ANECDOTALLY FROM FOLKS THEY HAVE A THREE MONTH WINDOW TO WAIT TO GET. THEIR FIRST TEST EVALUATION REGISTERED AND THEN ANOTHER THREE MONTH WAIT. TO GET- THEIR SECRETS REGISTERED AND THEN ANOTHER THREE MONTH WAIT AFTER THAT. TO GET THEIR LICENSURE SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THREE MONTHS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A NINE MONTH. EXTRA SERVICE WE DO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THAT IS AFFECTED BY. THE SAME THINGS WE SEE ELSEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE ACCESS ISSUES- SO THERE ARE PATHWAYS TO HELP REDUCE THOSE BARRIERS- BUT THE CRUX OF. WHAT OUR FOR ORGANIZATIONS SOCIAL WORKERS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST CLINICAL CAST TALKING ABOUT. IS TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE AND OTHERWISE- GIVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEDI CAL PROVIDERS CONTROL WHEN WE ACTUALLY CHEESE OR CHEESE COUNTY FACILITY. TO ACTUALLY RECRUIT RETAIN THOSE TRAINEES SO THEY CAN WORK TWENTY THREE THOUSAND CLINICAL HOURS. WHILE ALSO BEING PAID TO DO SO WHICH. IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE. WE'LL TALK ABOUT DOING THAT- PRE. OR POST. THAT WOULD BE POST SO- MICROTECH SPEAK MORE SPECIFICALLY TO CYCLE BECAUSE I'M A DEBT I KNOW BACK WITH AND ASKED SEVENTY TWO ALSO SPEAK UP MINIMUM TWO YEARS SLASH THREE THOUSAND HOURS OF CLINICAL WORK BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR LICENSURE- AND DURING THAT TIME THEY HAVE TO BE DIRECTLY SUPERVISED. AND SINCE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN OTHER SETTINGS BUT BECAUSE THE PAY RATE FOR LICENSE CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT ACCOUNT IS A FAR LOWER THAN MANAGED CARE OR THE PRIVATE SECTOR- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO NOT ONLY HAS TO BE DOING CLINICAL WORK IN THESE MEDICAL SETTINGS BUT ALSO. HAS TO PROVIDE SOME SUPERVISORY WORK AND THOSE TRAINEES TO WORK IN THE SETTINGS ARE OFTEN NOT PAID TO DO THAT. SO THEY ARE WORKING AT PAYING OFF STUDENT LOAN DEBT AT THE SAME TIME THE ALSO WILL BE TRUMP CLINICAL LIKE SH AND SO WHAT WE SEE IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS PART OF OUR ATKINS HEART OF THE LARGER FOCUS ASSETS DONE BY THAT COALITION THAT YOU MENTION. IS TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME DIRECT FINANCIAL RESULTS PARTICULARLY THE MEDICAL FACILITIES TO ALLOW THEM TO BRING THESE FOLKS ON SO THEY CAN ALSO SEE PATIENTS WHILE THEY'RE DOING THEIR TRAINING HOURS BUT THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP NOW BETWEEN THE TRAINING AND NOT SO ELITE. WHICH MAKES THEM MORE LIKELY TO POTENTIALLY STAY ON THAT'S AFTER THEY'RE DONE WITH THE GLOBAL LIFESTYLE. DIFFICULT TRADING. OKAY THAT YOU THE PER SEMESTER THIRTY TWO HIGH- AND IN MY- MAYBE NOT MEDICAL CLINIC FROM EXPERIENCE IS A ARE PAY DURING- DURING THAT TIME BECAUSE THERE THERE BE A TO USE AS A AS A NEW JUST WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. DOING THE SUPERVISION- BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE IN A MEDICAL FACILITY IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. CORRECT THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES THAT DO. MAKE PAYMENTS BUT IT IS NOT A UNIFORM PRACTICE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AROUND WITH AT ONE TIME BUDGET OUT. TWENTY ONE SO AND I GUESS THIS IS MAYBE TO. MISTER MS RESULT THE I MEAN ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES I KNOW IN THE FIELD THIS FOR SHE WAS GETTING PEOPLE THROUGH THE LICENSURE PROCESS IS ADEQUATE SUPERVISION OTHERS OFTENTIMES NOT ENOUGH SUPERVISION OR NONPROFIT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GREAT A GREAT CLINICAL EXPERIENCE BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE A- LICENSE PERSON TO DO THAT SUPERVISION THEY CAN'T. THEY CAN'T HIRE SURVEYED PEOPLE CAN'T GET EXPERIENCEWAS UP. TO CASCADING IMPACT- AND WE THOUGHT ABOUT PROVIDING STATE LEVEL PEOPLE WOULD WITH LICENSURE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SEVEN THAT SUPERVISION- THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM AND ESPECIALLY IN OUR SMALLER RURAL AREAS. YES AS PART OF OUR WORK AROUND BEHAVIOR HEALTH PLEASE WE'VE BEEN. LOOKING AT WAYS TO SUPPORT- SUPERVISION AND IN IN A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF. OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO BE- SUPERVISOR THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON- IN INCORPORATING INTO OUR PROGRAMS. OKAY I THINK THAT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT HI DENNIS NO MY OWN HOME COUNTIES IF THE ISSUE OF HUGE IMPORTANCE- MISTER MISTER BYRD. I'M SORRY IS IT R&amp;D IS IT RENDERS IT RYAN DOES IT HOW DO I SAY THAT. RINDE BRENDA OKAY WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THE CURRENTLY THE TERMINAL DEGREE FOR WHEN WORKING IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LICENSURE IS THAT THEN JUST ADD. NOT JUST BUT AN LCSW OR LICENSE I COLLEGES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ON A SEPARATE LICENSURE DEGREE CORRECT. NO TODAY IT'S NOT A SEPARATE LICENSURE SO WE DO HAVE- PREDOMINATELY- USE AN LCSW SPENT DO YOU WORK IN OUR SUBSTANCE USE FACILITIES SO THE ISSUE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT SUPERVISION THAT'S ALSO PERTAIN TO OUR SUBWAYS THIS OP. OKAY SENATOR REID I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT ON THE STREET PROVISIONS SIDE- WE DO HAVE TO PUBLIC POLICY BILLS MOVING ONE FOR THE BORDER BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. I AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BY SOME WOMAN AGUIAR-CURRY AND FOR PSYCHOLOGY FOR PSYCHOLOGY AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY FOUR BY SOMEONE IN A REBEKAH BAUR CHAND THAT WOULD PERMANENTLY CODIFY THE REMOTE SUPERVISION CAPABILITIES. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION ALLOWED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- BUT WILL GO AWAY ONCE THE PANDEMIC OF ORDER IS LIFTED. SO WE DO ALSO SEE TREMENDOUS VALUE IN HAVING REMOTE SUPERVISION WHICH ALLOWS FOR GEOGRAPHIC FLEXIBILITY IS ALSO ACOSTA BOTH SUPERVISORS TRAINING SO THAT IS ALSO ONE SOLUTION THAT'S MOVING ON THE POLICY SIDE- IF THE ADMINISTRATION WERE SO INCLINED PULLING THOSE BOTH INTO A TRAILER BILL WOULD ALSO FURTHER ACTION. SETS. OKAY THANK YOU A AND I'M GONNA I'M NOT GONNA ABOUT OUR COMMERCE ABOUT PRAYER THANK YOU DR GRANT. THANK YOU AND THE PRETTY THE PANELS PRESENT- I THINK I THINK THE CHAIR COVERED MANY OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD BUT- I DID HAVE A COUPLE. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS INTENDED SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY- WAS A ROOF WORKFORCE RESEARCHER MY PREVIOUS LIFE AS AS WELL AS A- PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND- FOR- RESIDENCY TRAINING SO I GUESS IS EDUCATIONAL DIRECTOR PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF. THIS OF THE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW BUILDING PIPELINES AND SO FORTH SO I GUESS ONE ONE QUESTION I HAVE IT'S PERHAPS MORE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT. AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT TRADE AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS AND SO FORTH. BUT WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING AN EDUCATION PROGRAM- AND- I THINK ALL THE EDUCATORS NO IS THAT. ONE TIME MONEY'S REALLY HARD TO WORK WITH. RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE STUDENTS YOU. ARE OUR TRAINEES I SHOULD SAY YOU KNOW- AND- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT- YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE TO FIND CLINICAL SITES YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY PRECEPTORS RIGHT THE- WE TALKED ABOUT THE OVER THE MENTORS AND SO FORTH- YOU HAVE TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOLKS AND THEN THE OTHER THING AND THEN- AND IT OF COURSE TO TRAIN. ITSELF KNOWS TAKES SOME TIME. AND IN MANY WAYS ACTUALLY LEARNS EVEN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER SO SAMPLE AND MY RESIDENCY PROGRAM WOULD REALLY HARD TO JUST HAVE ONE CLASS OR A COUPLE CLASSES BE LARGER THAN. THE ONES THAT WERE BEFORE AND AFTER- AND SO FORTH SO. SO I GUESS THE A QUESTION I HAVE THE CERTAIN WE HAVE AN ACUTE NEED. THAT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. WHAT IS THE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND CERTAINLY SITTING ON BUDGET COMMITTEE KNOW THE YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES A ONE TIME AND ONGOING AND SO FORTH AND THE VOLATILITY SOMETIMES IN OUR- OUR- REVENUES- BUT BUT HOW DO WORKING WITH- TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY RAMP UP AND THEN- AND THEN ACTUALLY FOR DOING ONE TIME ARE ONE TIME OVER SEVERAL YEARS RAMP DOWN AGAIN- AND NOT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION- BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY A STRUGGLE I'VE SEEN I'VE- ALWAYS HAD PROGRAMS LIKE THE ACA HAD A PROGRAM PROVIDED THEM ONE MORE PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS THE- BED. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE- FUNDING. IS SHORT TERM AND MANY PROGRAMS ACTUALLY. TURNED IT DOWN THEY WOULD EVEN TRY BECAUSE- PLYING BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT SEE HOW THAT WOULD. THAT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE EDUCATION PROGRAM ITSELF TO TRY TO RAMP UP AND THEN LYING DOWN SO- SO WHAT WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS ARE BEING HAD- WITH WITH WITH EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF. WHAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SUS YELLED TO DO THE TRAINING AND TO CREATE THAT CAPACITY- TO ENSURE WE HAVE QUALIFIED YOU KNOW. THAT QUALIFIED THAT PEOPLE COMING THROUGH BECAUSE THEY'RE QUALIFIED BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY EDUCATION SO TO MAINTAIN THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION. QUALITY EDUCATION NECESSARY- SO. THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE SUSTAIN THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES- AS WE'RE WORKING WITH THE TRAINING INSTITUTIONS TO- WE WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- BUT WHAT THIS YOU KNOW NEEDS ARE TO SUSTAIN IT- AS WE AS- AS YOU'RE SAYING IS THEY BUILD UP THOSE PROGRAMS. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO. WORK WITH THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT. OKAY SORRY- I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE REALLY WASN'T ANSWERED- I MEAN AT SOME OF THESE THINGS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A TEN YEAR TIME FRAMES WHICH IS- BUT THEN THE OTHER ONES ARE LIKE THREE YEARS OR FIVE YEARS AND- AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE TRAINING- IT. IS I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE HOW TO USE IT RIGHT- IT IN A WAY THAT- SAYS FULLY SO- I THINK THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS BUT ALSO IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT IS TO SHARE THEM WITH THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO YEAH WE DO BUDGETS EVERY YEAR AND SO FORTH- AND AS WERE CRAFTING OUT HOW YOUR- PROJECTIONS AND I GUESS THAT'S- THANK FOR FINANCE- THAT. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WORK FORCE. IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO SHORT TERM THINGS THAT L. UNLESS- BECAUSE IT'S JUST. ME AND EDUCATION PROGRAM TAKES TIME TO DEVELOP IT'S NOT JUST SO YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE MAY WANNA FLY YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT. LIKE YOU CAN SUDDENLY EXPLODE THE NUMBER AND THEN DRINK IT AGAIN ALRIGHT IT'S- THAT AND SO- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE PUT. DOWN THESE WORKFORCE PROPOSALS THAT WE REALLY YOU KNOW MAP OUT WHAT HAPPENS AND THEN WORK WITH EDUCATORS SAY WELL HOW G. FIFTY IS THAT IF. THIS TIME FRAME RIGHT. THREE YEAR TRAINING PROGRAM FOR YOU TO THE FUNDING ISN'T DEL IS GOING TO WORK FOR A WHILE RIGHT. CETERA I GUESS FOR THE PANEL. HOW MUCH OF AN ISSUE IS THIS FOR AND NOT I KNOW MANY STILL SEND SOME OF YOUR LEGIT ADVOCATES IN ACTUALLY THE TRAINEE ALL THE TRAINING PROGRAM DIRECTORS ITSELF BUT- IS THIS AN ISSUE FOR THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM YOUR ASSOCIATIONS FROM. THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE TRAINING PROGRAMS. YES GRANT CAN I SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT SO. ONE OF OUR SPECIAL DIVISION. IS ON EDUCATION. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CLINICIANS WHO WORK- IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN MANAGED CARE SETTINGS AND THE CAL SETTINGS AFTER IT LIKE SAY THE KIND OF. HEALTH FACILITIES AND SO THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES WHERE- PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF CERTAIN TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY- THERE ARE CERTAIN. RESTRICTIONS REQUIREMENTS FOR TRAINEES WERE HAVING TO TRAVEL SOMETIMES AN HOUR TWO HOURS. AWAY TO SEE THEIR SUPERVISOR SO PART OF THAT WERE HOPING. AT LEAST THE LOW HANGING FRUIT IS KIND OF FIND OUT WHAT'S REVISIONS TO SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES THERE. BUT THE OTHER PROBLEM WE'VE SEEN AS ONE- THAT- BACK ALLUDED TO AND DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IN THE STUDY PROGRAMS. WE'VE SEEN WITH US AS WELL AS- THERE'S A LIMITED OF ANY. WAS BOTH A PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NONPROFIT. ACTUALLY DOING THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING THAT'S NECESSARY TO MEET THE CLINICAL WORK FORCE- THERE ARE GREAT PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES YES YOU CAN CITIES. THAT COULD BE DOING MORE OF THIS WORK BUT WE ALSO ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT. WITH THE INCREASE IN PUBLIC EDUCATION- SLOTS AS WE SEEM PARTICULAR BERKELEY THIS YEAR WITH SOME OF THE LAWSUIT HOUSING. YOU'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT NECESSARILY TAKING SPOTS AWAY FROM PROGRAMS- BUT WE DO FEEL AS THOUGH THAT IS NECESSARY THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME. SERIOUS DISCUSSION WITH STRICTLY THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN TERMS OF EXPANDING. WHO IS BEING ABLE TO BE EDUCATED AND WHAT PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT IS REALLY WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS ROAD. IT ALSO HAS THE BEST YOU GRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION- SO WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE IN CENTRAL VALLEY. THE HIGH DESERT THE CENTRAL COAST THAT'S WHERE THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGE UC AND CSU SAYS. CAN REALLY BE A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN THE WAY THAT SOME OF OUR LARGE- PRIVATE PROPERTY GROUP BRANDON INSTITUTIONS JUST REALLY KICKED. IN OKAY THEN ONE OTHER QUESTION YES. I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD ALSO AT LEAST ABOUT I WANTED TO ALSO SHARED THAT. THE WORK OF THE NEW CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION TRAINING COUNCIL. THAT WOULD ESTABLISH IS REALLY ONE OF ITS REAL GOALS IS REALLY TO LOOK AT THOSE THINGS AND SO. ON THAT COUNCIL WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM CSU FOR YOU SEE FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIMARY CARE ALLIED HEALTH CENTER AND SO WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT TOGETHER THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT IS AS WE AS WE BUILD OUT. YOU KNOW THE WORKFORCE EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAMS AND CAPACITY FOR CALIFORNIA. OKAY AND- ALL RIGHT WELL. IN THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE. THE RESULTS THOSE QUESTIONS WITH WITH US ETERNAL LIFE. OUT ALSO MAKING I MEAN I KNOW I KNOW THAT THE ARE SOME ROUGH TO THE- FUTURE OF CARE WORKS COMMISSION- YEAH. I'D KEEP IN MIND THAT THAT WAS THE PRE COVERT- THE L. AND ONE CHALLENGE WORK FOR. IN CHANGE AND SO FORTH DEMAND FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I THINK IS INCREASED- AND- SO- AND IT'S ALWAYS CHALLENGE WITH WORKFORCE REPORTS SISTER DONE REFLECTING THE TIMES STORE AT NO NOT REFLECTING. NECESSARILY THE THINGS HAVE BEEN BERMAN HAS CHANGED BUT- WHEN THE OTHER GUESTS ISSUES IN TERMS OF- BEHAVIORAL WORK WORK FOR CERTAINLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRAINING. IS ACTUALLY RETENTION RATE- SO WE OFTENTIMES WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE WE TALK ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND PEOPLE GOING THROUGH TRAINING BUT ALSO THE RETENTION AND GREAT SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO BE SURE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE YOU TRAINED. ARE ARE- BEING SUPPORTED. RIGHT AND ANSWER RELATED TO THAT- IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE ARE THE TEACHERS WHO ARE TEACHING OUR FATE EDUCATION A WAY THAT IT'S COMPETITIVE WITH THEM NOT TEACHING AND JUST SEEING PATIENTS AND HOW THAT COMPARED TO THE PEOPLE DECIDE TO THEN PURSUE OTHER CAREERS OR RETIRED OR SO FORTH. SO YOU'LL WE GOT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WORK FORCE YES BUT NOT ONLY THE INPUTS BUT ALSO- BILL WHERE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING TO AS WELL SO ARE- AND- GIVE AND I THINK PERHAPS. THEM THIS MAY BE AN ISSUE WITH THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE THAT CERTAINLY WILL BE AN ISSUE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE AS WELL BORDERS A- VERY HIGH LEVEL OF BURNOUTS AT PDS AND HE- THAT SUTTER- THAT'S GOING ON AND THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY- AS A RESULT OF PANDEMIC AND- FRANKLY THE REFUSAL OF MANY PEOPLE TO- IT HERE TO. PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES STAT- AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS OF COURSE MORE STRAIN ON PEOPLE ON THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY- BUT ALSO STRAIN ON THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH COMMUNITIES WELL- I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT REBEKAH GONZALEZ FLETCHER. ASSEMBLY IN CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU MAY GUESS. LOS SALARIES ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS PEOPLE LEAVE THE FIELD OF SOCIAL WORK AND I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH. AND WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT COUNTIES ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED AND ENSURE PRIVATE FUNDING FOR FOUNDATIONS REFLECT WORKFORCE PRIORITIES AND THEN ALSO BUILDING AND- BUILDING ORGANIZED ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO PRIORITIZE SOCIAL WORK SERVICES- BUT I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF PROGRAMS. THAT REALLY I'M WHAT CHANGED SOCIAL WORK STAFF AGAIN. ONE OF THOSE IS THE FOUR PLUS ONE TRAINING WHICH IS PROGRAM. WHICH IS A PROGRAM WHERE I'M SOCIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE THEIR BSW IN SOCIAL WORK AND GET THEIR MASTERS IN ONE YEAR AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT IN THOSE PROGRAMS THOSE FOLKS ARE TWO POINT FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO. CONTINUE WORKING IN PUBLIC SIX SYSTEMS AFTER COMPLETING THEIR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS. SO I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT WORK- DAD CAN'T KEEP. ED TRAINING PROGRAMS AND THESE ARE BASED ON HER RESEARCH MODEL AND THEIR STIPEND PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT DURING SCHOOL. REQUIRES SPECIALIZED PRACTICE AND SERVICE COMMITMENTS AND THEY'RE REALLY VALUABLE FOR RETAINING STAFF. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SHARING THEIR- THANK YOU CHRIS. THANK YOU. MILLION DOLLARS JUST A FOLLOW UP ON THAT HOW WAS THAT IS BECAUSE FOUR PLUS ONE HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM AT THE NEW VANS PLACEMENT PROGRAM. IT IS THE SAME THING ACTUALLY SO IT'S AN ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAM AND WE NEED MORE OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA- I'M I'M HOPING THAT AS A SENATOR WIENER'S AND INTEL SB NINE SIX FOUR- WE ARE WORKING ON HEALTH LEE- WE ARE SLEEPING CRAFTING AMENDMENTS TO MORE SPECIFICALLY FOCUS BACK ON- HAVING MORE ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAMS BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS WORK. AND WE NEED THEM AND MORE SCHOOLS. EXCEPT I KNOW TEN TO BE AS SHE- POP. FOR A GROWING POPULATION AND IN SCHOOLS I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT HAS TO DO WITH C. S. W. E. THE- THE NATIONAL ACCREDITING. VERSUS THE LOCAL SCHOOLS YOU KNOW. WELL I DO KNOW THAT THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTED BY NATIONAL ACCREDITATION STANDARDS AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE ABOUT- HAVING EXPERT. EXPEDITE A SOCIAL WORK PROGRAMS REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS ON THOSE THAT ARE NATIONALLY ACCREDITED OR ELSE THEY WILL BE SOCIAL WORK PROGRAMS. OKAY OKAY THING YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR PANEL DISCUSSION I THANK YOU ALL VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR EXPERTISE THANK YOU- ARE MOVING UNDER PANELIST QUESTION HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE NEEDS- AND AGAIN THE COMMITTEE HAS SUBMITTED- HAS INVITED PEOPLE AND SUBMITTED QUESTIONS FOR THEM TO RESPOND TO SO WE HAVE WITH US I'M CHAU GIVENS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BETH MELANAU SKI THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS ADVOCATE FOR SEIU CALIFORNIA WE HAVE CLEAR AND RIGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. WE HAVE CATHERINE SCOTT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF A STATE RELATIONS- HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE HAVE DENNIS AB CUEVAS ROMERO LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR CMA AND- NATOLI D. AS DEPUTY DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION- WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU- AND WHY DON'T WE START IN ORDER WITH MISTER GIVENS. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING TERM WHICH GET IN FORGET. HIS NAME IS BUT GIVEN TO ASKS I WANT TO THANK YOU YOUR LEADER AND FOR. FUNDING TO REBUILD OUR PUBLIC INTEREST. EXPAND OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CAPACITY OUT WE NOW COME TO YOU ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA CAN'T WE COLLECTIONS PUBLIC HERO INITIATIVE WHICH IS A SERIES OF ONE TIME ADDITIONAL BUDGET REQUESTS TOTALING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION TO SUPPORT THE RECRUITMENT. RETENTION TRAINING- AND TRAINING OF OUR GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS A FEW SIGNIFICANT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CHALLENGES WHICH EXISTED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND SIMILARLY THAT CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT LISTED PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS ONE OF THE PRIORITY PROFESSIONS. NOTING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF CURRENT LEADERS WERE SLATED FOR RETIREMENT AGAIN AT THE TIME OF THAT REPORT WAS IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEY ALSO REPORTED THAT AT THE TIME LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAD SIGNIFICANT. READING AND RETAINING ALL OF WORKERS. THE AMERICAN OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO NOTED THAT ONLY 17% OF GRADUATES FROM SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH WENT ON TO WORKING GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH. AND UNFORTUNATELY DURING THE PANDEMIC PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS FACE HARASSMENT AND THREATS. WHICH RESULTED IN LEADERSHIP DEPARTURES IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE LOST OVER SIXTY TWO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEADERS. MAKING IT HARDER TO RECRUIT WORKERS INTO GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES CALIBRATED AND HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO BOLSTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE AND WE MUST CHANGE THAT. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT AT THE PUBLIC EURONET AT PACKAGE WHICH CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. OF THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED FOR OR COULD BE USED FOR LONGER PAYMENT SIGN ON BONUSES LONGEVITY BONUSES OR OTHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGIES AS APPROVED BY EACH HIGH. WE'RE ASKING FOR TEN MILLION TO GO TO THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING TO AWAIT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE CERTIFICATION FEES FOR THREE YEARS. THESE ARE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES IN KERR- AND THAT DOES NOT YIELD THEM HIGHER PAYER SALARIES. I WHERE I TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION TO SUPPORT EDUCATION TRAINING FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO WANT TO ENHANCE THEIR SKILLS AND PROMOTE INTO ROLES REQUIRING ADVANCED DEGREES. TWENTY FOUR MILLION TO EXPAND SEAT. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH PATHWAYS TRAINING CORPS TO SUPPORT EARLY PLACE FOR PLACEMENT OF EARLY CAREER PROFESSIONALS FROM THE COMMUNITY. INTO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WAS HE PAGE WATCH THIS TRAINING CORPS THEY HAD OVER NINE HUNDRED APPLICANTS BUT ONLY HAVE FORTY FIVE SLOTS. SO THIS WOULD EXPAND COOKER SIZE TWO HUNDRED TRAINEES PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS. SIX POINT FIVE MILLION WITH EXPANSIVE BEACHES CALIFORNIA MICROBIOLOGIST TRAIN COHORT TO THIRTY TRAINEES PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS. THIS TRAINING IS A REQUIREMENT THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO BECOME A CERTIFIED MICROBIOLOGIST IN THESE. ARE THE FOLKS THAT STUFF FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. AS ARE ALSO ASKING FOR SIX POINT SIX NINE TO SERVE SEEK. PUBLIC HEALTH LAB A SPIRE. WHICH INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT SHORTAGE OF LAUGHTER. I CAN TELL YOU FOR THAT WE DO HAVE LEFT. THEY GONE THROUGH THIS PRO SO IT IT'S- SIX POINT FIVE MILLION WOULD EXPAND CALIFORNIA'S- SEE PEACHES CAL EIS TRAINING TWO HUNDRED FELLOWS OVER THREE YEARS. THIS WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRAINED EPIDEMIOLOGIST OUR STATE MIGHT BE SEEN FELLOW THAT CDPH AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THIS PACKAGE SUPPORTS VARIOUS LEVELS OF OUR WORKFORCE EARLY CAREER PROFESSIONALS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DRAW AND FROM THE COMMUNITY. EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS AT ONE ADVANCE THEIR SKILLS. AS SKILL POSITION THAT REQUIRE BROADER TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND A FOCUS OF HARD TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN POSITIONS. WITH THIS WE HOPE TO BEGIN CREATING A PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE TO CONSERVE CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS TO COME THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MOVING ON TO OUR SECOND SPEAKER TODAY. MY PLACE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AT CATS SCOTT PLEASE FOR CALIFORNIA HAS SO SHE- GOOD MORNING YOU FOR HAVING US HI AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE PANEL ENSURE THE HOSPITAL. SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING OUR MOST COMMON WORKFORCE CHALLENGES AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE STATE INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS THOSE TIMES. HOSPITALS HAVE FACED WORKFORCE CHALLENGES FOR YEARS UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED THE WORST STAFFING SHORTAGE IN MEMORY AS A RESULT OF RETIREMENT AND THE SLOWED PIPELINE. THIS IS TAKING A HEAVY TOLL ON HOSPITALS AND FRONTLINE WORKERS. A STUDY RELEASED BY KAUFMAN HALL THE TREMENDOUS COLLECTIVE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC PUSH 51% OF HOSPITALS INTO THE REST. OF THE START OF THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS OF LOS ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AND RECEIVE FREE ONLY HAVING RECEIVED EIGHT BILLION FEDERAL. WHEN ANALYZING THE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR THE COST INCREASES THEY ATTRIBUTED THE MAIN DRIVER. TO HIGHER LABOR COSTS AND MEDICAL. SUPPLY CHAIN SHORTAGES MUCH OF THIS WAS A RESULT OF WORK FOR CHALLENGES WERE HOSPITALS HAD TO RELY HEAVILY ON TIME CONTRACT STAFFING TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE PANDEMIC. AT ALMOST DOUBLE THE RATE. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC SEAT YOU SUPPORTED THE FUTURE THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE WORKFORCE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE PATH OUTLINED IN THE MEETING. THE DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE REPORT RELEASED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE CRITICAL STOPS STILL APPLY TO INCREASE. UP TO INCREASE CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE INCLUDING EXPANDING EDUCATION AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. INCREASING DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION. AND INCLUSION OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE I STAYED IN THE GOVERNORS CARE ECONOMY INITIATIVE. WHICH EMBODIES THESE APPROACHES TEACHERS ON FULL SUPPORT OF HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT EXPAND WORKFORCE TRAINING AND EDUCATION. FULLER MEMBERS REPORT SHORTAGES IN ALL AREAS BUT HOSPITALS NURSING AT ALL LEVELS ARE AND CNA'S L. B. AND- CENTS NURSE PACTITIONERS AND NURSE MIDWIVES ALWAYS COME UP IS A CRITICAL NEED. ADDITIONALLY THE PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED THE WORSENING DOCTOR SHORTAGE. OF UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS TRAIN MORE DOCTORS THAN ALMOST EVERY OTHER STATE ARE WE ARE NEARLY LAST IN THE COUNTRY IN RECEIVING STATE SUPPORT FOR THESE GME PROGRAMS. IS COSTLY JIMMY PROGRAMS ARE LARGELY UNDERFUNDED AND FACE SIGNIFICANT BUDGETARY REST AS POSSIBLE BEGIN THEIR LONG ROAD TO FINANCIAL RECOVERY FOLLOWING THE PANDA. CJ PROPOSED OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION IN STATE FUNDING FOR GME PROGRAMS. THROUGH THE MEDICAID HEALTH PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES THE STATE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES ALL THEIR INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT CAN BE MATCHED A SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING. ONLY TWENTY ONE HOSPITALS TODAY ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR THE MEDICARE GME PROGRAM AND I REQUEST EXPERIENCE THAT CRITICAL ACCESS TO STATE AND FEDERAL SUPPORT. FOR THE OTHER EIGHTY ONE HOSPITALS TEACHING THE FUTURE. DOCTORS OF CALIFORNIA. LASTLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO. THE PROGRAM MAKE ANY. FOR INCREASE DIVERSE AND EQUITY HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE YOU CANNOT BE DONE WITH. WHILE CONTINUING TO UNDER COMMUNITY. THAT PROVIDED. AMOUNT OF. SERVICES TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES TEACHER PROPOSES TO UNFREEZE THEIR FEE FOR SERVICE RATES AN AUGMENT THESE PAYMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES PATIENTS. MAY BE EXPERIENCING ALONG WITH CONVERTING PUBLICADO RATES TO VALUE BASED PURCHASING TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THESE HOSPITALS AS THEY SUPPORT PATIENTS AND THEIR WORK FORCE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOW WILL MOVE TO THAT. MR CUEVAS ROMERO. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR DENNIS THE MATTER WHAT THE LEAD. LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE- CMA HAS SEVERAL PROPOSALS SEEKING TO ADDRESS THE POSITION SHORTAGE IN BOTH THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM. FIRSTLY CMA IS APPRECIATIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM. AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROPOSALS. IN PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSED ON THE PROPOSED FUNDING TO SUPPORT PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY POSITIONS. AS THIS COMMITTEE WELL KNOWS IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED THOROUGHLY ALREADY MENTAL HEALTH WAS A MAJOR ISSUE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND COVER NINETEEN IS ONLY FURTHER EXACERBATED. THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. CMA IS A AT THE LEGISLATURE TO INVEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED- TO SUPPORT GRADUATE MEDIC MEDICAL EDUCATION. ALONG WITH SEIU CALIFORNIA AND THE CALLUM BORN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY TO INCREASE LOCALLY TRAINED PHYSICIANS. IN THAT SAME VEIN CMA IS. PURSUING OUR CAT CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE PHYSICIANS FIND THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT'S PART OF THAT CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS BUDGET PRIORITIES. WHICH CREATES A SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM PROVIDING UP FRONT FUNDING FOR UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY EDUCATION FOR INDIVIDUALS UNDER REPRESENTED MEDICINE. THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD MAKE A SERVICE COMMITMENT UPON COMPLETION OF THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN A RURAL OR MEDICAL MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. OUR PROPOSAL IS REQUESTING TWENTY MILLION TO SUPPORT THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO DEVELOPING A FUTURE GENERATION OF DIVERSE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT POSITIONS. ANOTHER CMA PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON PROVIDING ANOTHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE BY CREATING A DEDICATED FIRST OF ITS KIND LONGER PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS WE HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR **** IN ADDITION TO A POLICY BILL. AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWO AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAY. GOING BACK TO GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION CALIFORNIA DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ONGOING DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE WHILE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX DOES FIND JIMMY THAT REVENUE SOURCE IS A DIMINISHING REVENUE- BASED ON TOBACCO USAGE- ADDITIONALLY CMA DOES NOT HAVE A CENTRAL PARK. SWEET CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A CENTRALIZED PLANNING UP TO OVERSEE AND PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY ON JIMMY. CREATING A DEDICATED REVENUE SOURCE WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENCY TO JIMMY PROVIDERS AND PLANNING LONG TERM AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY DOCTOR PANTS AND POTENTIALLY CREATE NEW PROGRAMS IN THE MOST NEEDED COMMUNITY SUCH AS REGIONS OF NORTHERN SIERRA. SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THEN WITH THEM QUITE. FINALLY AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY- THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE COULD HELP PROVIDER BURNOUT AND MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF THE- PROVIDING CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC IS ESSENTIAL- THAT WE TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- CMA IS HAPPY TO ENGAGE AND WORK TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION TO HELP.RESOLVE THESE ISSUES THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S NOW MOVE TO OUR FINAL.

OKAY THANK YOU I'M SURE AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS I THINK- IT DID BRING UP THE POINT TO BE REAL HEALTH PANEL THE TASSEL PLIGHT OF THIS PANEL- BUT I GUESS- THE FIRST OF ALL. I DO AYE KNOWLEDGE THE- YEAH- OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. THERE'S RESEARCH THAT SHOWS SO AT THAT WE TALKED MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE STRESS AND THE FRANKLY- POSTER MAX STRESS DISORDER THAT'S BEING EXPERIENCED BY THE OVERALL HEALTH WORKFORCE BECAUSE OF COVIDIEN- THE STRUGGLES OF. OF MANY OF THE FOR THIS PARTICULAR FRONTLINE. FOLKS BUT I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT- ACTUALLY DOES RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE HAS BEEN EVEN MORE IMPACTED SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH. PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE IS ON THE FRONT IS ON THE FRONT LINES AND- UNFORTUNATELY- HEALTH CARE WORKERS OVERALL BUT PARTICULARLY PUBLIC HEALTH. WORKERS HAVE ALSO BEEN SUBJECT TO PERSONAL ATTACKS HARASSMENT- NOT JUST IN THE WORKPLACE BUT EVEN AT THEIR HOMES- SO WE'VE SEEN CERTAINLY. HEALTHCARE WORKERS- AND HOSPITALS AND OTHER PLACES BEING ATTACKED AT THEIR- WORK PLACE- UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO MISINFORMATION OR DISINFORMATION AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT HAVE INCITED- NOT BE OF COURSE- DELIVERS THAT HARM. PATIENTS BUT ALSO FACTUALLY LED TO VIOLENT ATTACKS. AGAINST HEALTH CARE WORKERS BUT- PUBLIC HEALTH- WORKERS THEMSELVES HAVE. ENTERED THESE ATTACKS AT. AND SOMETIMES. PROBLEMS AND- SO- BUT IT WAS THAT WE ALSO THAT SO VERY THAT. TRY TO- SUSTAIN THAT WERE FORCE EXPAND I THINK THAT CERTAINLY APPLIES TO THE OTHER WORKFORCES AS WELL- PERHAPS- MAYBE I'LL JUST OPPOSE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS SAID BECAUSE WE'RE SHORT ON TIME IS. YELLOW AGAIN THERE'S A LOT PROPOSALS FOR PIPELINE CERTAINLY ONE OF THE SUPPORT OF THOSE BUT CAN YOU SPEAK TO PARTICULARLY RETENTION. EFFORTS TO HELPS SUSTAIN OUR CURRENT WORK FORCE- MANY OF WHOM UNFORTUNATELY ARE EITHER LOOKING TO RETIREMENT SOON OUR- JUST OR JUST BASICALLY LEAVING BECAUSE IF THEY'RE FED UP- SO CAN WE TALK ABOUT RETENTION EFFORTS THAT- WE SHOULD BE PURSUING IS THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP THE- WORKFORCE WE HAVE. CONTINUING TO GO TO CONTINUING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED. WHAT'S THAT YEAH. AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD PLEASE YOU KNOW AND PERCENT I JUST THE SHEET THE COMMON THAT YOU MADE IT KNOWLEDGE IN THE HER CHALLENGES THAT WORKFORCE IS IN TOWARD I THINK IT ALSO NOT- ONLY IS KIND OF THE LINE RIGHT AS ARM ARE WORK SEASON LEADERSHIP LEAVING THE THAT WERE ABOUT SUCCEEDING IN LEADERSHIP OR MAYBE MY DIFFERENT CHOICES AND EXPLORING OTHER OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STATEMENT THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION EIGHT THE REASON WHY WE'RE DOING THAT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED A MIXTURE OF LIKE NEW WORK FORCE BUT ALSO RETAINING OUR EXISTING WORKFORCE AND SO. PART OF THIS IS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ARE BEING OFFERED SIGN ON BONUSES FROM OTHER ENTITIES LIKE COME OUR WAY AND SO COULD WE NEGOTIATE A LONGEVITY BONUS FOR THESE NURSES ARE AGREEING TO STAY WITH US FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SO THAT WE CAN RETAIN THAT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL SET SIMILARLY WITH LAB DIRECTORS AND SO FORTH AND THE OTHER THING THAT WE REALLY TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL LINE IS REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE HELP FOLKS ADVANCE IN THEIR CAREERS WHILE THEY'RE ALREADY IN THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THAT IS WHAT. THE TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION IS DEDICATED TO REALLY ALLOWING OUR EXISTING WORKFORCE LET'S SAY YOU'RE YOU'RE IN BUT YOU WANT TO BECOME AS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES A MORE ADVANCED OR SKILL DEGREED MAYBE A LAB ASSISTANT YOU WANTED IT TO THE LAB DIRECTOR LEVEL WE WANT TO HAVE. FOR YOU TO CONTINUE YES THE SKILL SETS THAT YOU STAY WITHIN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST MENTION A NUMBER OF THE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES EVEN THAT THE PATHWAYS PROGRAM RATES GRABBING EARLY CAREER INDIVIDUALS THE INTENT IS TO GIVE EXPOSURE INTO PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOPEFULLY THAT MAKE FOLKS STAY IN JUST AS AN ASIDE I WILL TELL YOU I SPOKE WITH THE PATHWAYS COHORT AND ONE GENTLEMAN MESSAGED ME ON THE SIDE IS THAT I AM THE OLD BASED BUT I AM NEW TO PUBLIC HEALTH I LOVE WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IT WAS JUST THE EXPOSURE AND THE OPPORTUNITY THAT ALLOWED. HIM TO REALLY REALIZE THAT SO WE WANTED TO HAVE THAT MIXTURE OF THINGS THAT COULD BRING PEOPLE AND DRAW THEM AND RETAIN THEM IN OUR WORKFORCE AND THEN ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT FOLKS CAN BE FILLED AND GET THAT THE CAPACITY AND SKILLS THEY NEEDED THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I SEE A. BUNCH OF BOOKS OTHER HAND UP SO WE'LL GO NOW HOW TO. MISS- MELANAU SKI.

AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO STAY COMMITTED TO PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR CAREERS. ADDITIONALLY I JUST COME IN A FEW OTHER- ELEMENTS- WE THINK ABOUT THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NURSING NITIATIVE I THINK ONE THE THINGS THAT EXCITES US. IS THINKING ABOUT THAT NURSING PIPELINE- AND THE POTENTIAL THAT IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN BUILDING OUT THAT PIPELINE WITH SOMEONE STARTS OUT- IN A CERTAIN. POSITION WITH THE NURSING THEY CONTINUE TO GROW TO THE NEXT LEVEL MAYBE THERE ARE IN TODAY. AND THEY WENT B. AND P. IN THE FUTURE JUST THINK AGAIN BUT HOW DO WE RETAIN INDIVIDUALS IN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE CERTAINLY ALSO UNDER INTEREST ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WE COULD BE DOING DIFFERENTLY WITH SKILLED NURSING- AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE POTENTIAL THE QUALITY STANDARDS BOARD IS THINKING ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. HOW DO WE GROW- SKILL UP OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES STAFF. AGAIN THEY ARE PROVIDING CARE FOR DECADES TO COME. AND LASTLY AUTISTIC KNOWLEDGE AS RELATES TO COMMUNITY HEALTH AND ACCURACY IS- PRIOR TO MY- TERM AS YEAH YOU I SPENT MANY YEARS WORKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION LET THINGS THAT WE OBSERVE. THAT HEALTH NEEDS WERE BECOMING THE TRAINING GROUND FOR THE REST OF DELIVERY SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND RESOURCES- TO INCREASE PAY. TO DO- TRAINING ON THE JOB I'M SURE. ELEMENT OUT OPPORTUNITIES WE WERE LOSING OUR WORK FORCE THE REST THE DELIVERY SYSTEM TO THE REASONS WHY SB I USE NOW COMMITTING. FORTY MILLION GENERAL FUND REQUEST TO GET OVER THREE YEARS THINK ABOUT NEW WAYS TO SUPPORT OUR CALL CENTER. WORKFORCE. AND KEEP THEM AND COMMUNITY HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY- MYSTERIOUS. ADL AND ADDING ON TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ALSO JUST WANT TO BUILD UP IT BY EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING YOU KNOW AN OVERALL PACKAGE WHICH IS THE ONE THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD THAT REALLY TARGETS MULTIPLE AREAS IN THE WHITE WINE OR IN THE BACKGROUND OF AN INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW TRAINING AND- PRACTICE. AND THAT'S REALLY A LARGE PART WHY WE WALKED OUT HOW WE CAN BUILD SOMETHING HAD AFFECT THE TRAINING RIGHT BECAUSE EVEN MY FRIEND NOT AS SOMEONE IS TRAINING FOR EXAMPLE IN A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER WE'RE TRYING TO AND YOU KNOW ALSO GET THEM FAMILIAR WITH HER STUDYING AND. YOU KNOW. NINETY NINE SHARPIE POP. AND IN BY THE- WATCHING BACK IN FRONT STATE OUR SETTING WANT. AND WHEN WE COME THAT SMALLER SHIPS LAUNDRY. RIGHT REALLY MAKING SURE WE CAN THAT CONNECTION.

IF THE PAY REMAIN ANAK OR INEQUITABLE TO URBAN AREAS I THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE A FOR RURAL AND UNDER COMMUNITIES SO- YOU KNOW THE WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT INCREASING THE INCREASING THE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE- THE FINDINGS FURTHER LOAN REPAYMENT BECAUSE THOSE PROGRAMS ARE OFTEN IMPACTED- AND YOU KNOW THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE I THINK ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT A LASTING I MENTIONED YOU KNOW FURTHER DE STIGMATIZE SCENE- OUTREACH AND GETTING SUPPORT WHEN- PROVIDERS AND PHYSICIANS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- BECAUSE THAT IT'S CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT YOU CAN'T CARE FOR YOUR PATIENTS AND YOU CAN'T CARE FOR YOURSELF AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE WHERE WE WE'VE TAKEN SOME POSITIVE STEPS WE NEED TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR- HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN POSITION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISS ENTER. I APPRECIATE THEM HAVING TRYING TO SPEAK MORE TIME BUT WHEN IT WAS LIKE TO REMIND FOLKS THAT THIS. <u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;/C IN&lt;/c&gt;</u> A.'S THAT THE WE HAVE IN OUR LONG TERM CARE. THE LONGER THEY'RE WITH US THE BETTER JOB THEY DO THE BOND RESEARCH OR RESIDENTS IF THEY STAY FOR FIVE YEARS THAT MEANS THAT THEY WERE DOING A GOOD JOB FOR THEM. USING THEM AS UPON AS A CAREER LADDER THAT THAT'S JUST A STEPPING STONE IS A DISSERVICE TO THE C. N. A.'S THAT WANT TO BE CNN'S. AND IT'S A DISSERVICE TO OUR RESIDENTS.
