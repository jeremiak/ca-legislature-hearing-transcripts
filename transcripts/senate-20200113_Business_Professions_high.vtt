SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS A

00:23:54.466 --> 00:23:56.301
MEDICAL PROBLEM THERE WAS A

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:59.104
WITNESS LAST APRIL WHO CAME MEN.

MEDICAL CONDITION AND THIS BILL

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.955
WOULD NOT PRECLUDE THAT KIND OF

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:18.690
SURGERY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:21.159
PERFECTLY HEALTHY BABIES WHO DO

NOT HAVE A HEALTH PROBLEM. BUT

00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:26.164
THEIR GENITALIA DO NOT CONFORM

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:27.465
WITH WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:30.368
TYPICAL AND SO THERE IS AN

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:30.869
EFFORT TO QUOTE ON QUOTE

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:34.573

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:02.834
FEW ASPECTS OF THE COMMITTEE-

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:57.689
BERKELEY CONFORMS TO WHAT ODDS

00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.190
WITH SOCIETY THINGS APPEARS TO

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:03.028
LOOK LIKE. AND A PERSON BY THE

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:03.662
AGE OF FIVE IS IDENTIFYING AS A

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:07.098
GIRL. ROOM ISMS ARE IRRELEVANT

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:09.567
THE WAY THE GENERAL'S LOOK ARE

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:10.135
RELEVANT TO SOMEONE'S GENDER

00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:12.437
AND WE SEE THAT. WITH THE

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:13.505
TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY WHICH IS

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:15.373
WHY THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.442
OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED THE BILL

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:18.610
AFTER BILL TO PROTECT

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:20.445
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE BECAUSE WE

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:22.814
DON'T SAY THAT WE LOOK ONLY AT

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:23.581
YOUR CHROMOSOMES ARE HOW YOUR

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:25.684
GENITALS LOOK TO THE SIDE. WHAT

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.953
GENDER YOU ARE AND WHETHER YOU

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:28.620
SHOULD HAVE SURGERY TO

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:31.156
RECONSTRUCT YOUR GENITALS IN A

00:26:31.222 --> 00:26:33.658
MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY WAY

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:34.092
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOUR

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.527
CHROMOSOMES ARE OR WHAT YOUR

00:26:35.593 --> 00:26:41.366
GENERALS. LOOK LIKE. THE

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.834
SUGGESTIONS IN THE ANALYSIS

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:45.103
DIAGNOSIS IS NOT PUT FORWARD

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.471
AMENDMENTS BUT THERE ARE

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:47.839
SUGGESTIONS OF. WHAT

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:50.575
AMENDMENTS. COULD BE- IF WE

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:51.810
WERE TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION

00:26:51.876 --> 00:26:53.511
MORE THAN 80% OF INTERSEX

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:56.081
PEOPLE WOULD BE REMOVED FROM

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:58.616
THE PROTECTIONS OF THIS BILL.

00:26:58.683 --> 00:27:01.286
ON FOR MUCH OF HUMAN HISTORY

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:02.253
PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN INTERSEX

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.157
WHICH IS LEFT ALONE. BASIS LIVE

00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:08.860
THEIR LIVES AND THAT WAS THAT.

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.261
IT WAS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:11.596
OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.064
DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.032
PERFORM MEDICALLY ON

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:16.601
NECESSARILY SURGERIES TO QUOTE

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:17.102
UNQUOTE NORMALIZE THESE

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:20.739
CHILDREN. THE SURGERIES THREE

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:23.541
VERY CLEAR ARE VERY INVASIVE

00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:25.910
AND RISKY SURGERIES IS

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:27.579
RECONSTRUCTING SOMEONE'S

00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:29.814
GENITALS. ACOSTA CAN CAUSE

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:32.484
PERMANENT STERILIZATION

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.553
PERMANENT LOSS OF SEXUAL

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.187
SENSATION FOR THE REST OF THEIR

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:38.656
LIVES YOUR REVERSIBLE.

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:42.093
PERMANENT URINARY TRACT ISSUES.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.795
AND THESE ARE SERIOUS POTENTIAL

00:27:43.862 --> 00:27:46.698
SIDE EFFECTS AND THAT'S WHY IT

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:47.232
IS APART FROM ANY ISSUE OF

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:50.335
GENDER. SOMEONE SHOULD BE ABLE

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.170
TO HAVE INPUT ABOUT WHETHER

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.204
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT KIND

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:54.873
OF MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:56.508
SURGERY THAT COULD HAVE

00:27:56.574 --> 00:27:58.376
PROFOUND NEGATIVEIMPACTS ON

00:27:58.443 --> 00:27:59.511
THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:01.479
LIVES AND YET THEY HAD NO

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:03.715
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WHETHER THEY

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:05.383
WANTED TO HAVE THAT SURGERY.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.585
AND WHAT OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES

00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:09.954
WOULD WE ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:15.060
THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. IN

00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:17.395
ADDITION. AND SEPARATE FROM NOT

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:19.764
BROADER ISSUE. WE KNOW THAT THE

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:21.833
WRONG GENDER CAN BE A SIGN.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.001
THAT A DAUGHTER COULD SAY WELL

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:25.136
YOUR AXE WHY AND THIS SEEMS

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:26.671
LIKE IT'S MORE LIKE A **** AND

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:29.040
A **** SO WE'RE JUST GONNA

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:29.707
RECONSTRUCTED AND MAKE IT INTO

00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:33.945
A **** OR VICE VERSA. AND THEN

00:28:34.012 --> 00:28:34.546
A FEW YEARS LATE LATER THE KID

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:37.082
SAYS BUT I'M A GIRL. WELL YOU

00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:39.084
CAN'T FIX IT THEN. MAYBE YOU

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.852
CAN MAYBE POTENTIALLY A LITTLE

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:43.288
BIT. BUT THAT IS A PERMANENT

00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:44.289
IRREVERSIBLE DECISION THAT WAS

00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:46.124
MADE FOR THAT CHILD NOT CHAO'S

00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:47.258
CAN HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT FOR

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:49.994
THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. EVEN

00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:50.495
THOUGH THEY HAD NO INPUT

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:56.067
WHATSOEVER. NOW WE HAVE MADE

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:56.835
AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THIS

00:28:56.901 --> 00:29:00.705
WEEK- HOW WE SCALE BACK ARE THE

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:02.874
BILL AROUND SOME- WHAT WERE

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.075
CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY GRAY

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:06.211
AREAS AROUND HYPOSPADIAS ONE OF

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:07.745
THE CONDITIONS WE LISTENED AND

00:29:07.812 --> 00:29:09.314
WE HEARD. AND WE MADE SOME

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.883
CHANGES. IN ADDITION ORIGINALLY

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.485
THE BILL SAID YOU CAN'T PERFORM

00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:15.120
THE SURGERY UNTIL THE CHILD CAN

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.654
PROVIDE QUOTE UNQUOTE INFORMED

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:18.089
CONSENT. WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS

00:29:18.156 --> 00:29:19.524
REASONABLE BECAUSE OUT OF WELL

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:21.693
DEVELOPED BODY OF CASE LAW BUT

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:23.161
VARIOUS SENATORS AND OTHERS

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:26.131
EXPRESSED- TO ME THAT- THAT

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:28.099
MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO VAGUE

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:28.967
THAT A PHYSICIAN MAY NOT KNOW.

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:31.703
WHAT'S INFORMED CONSENT. SO WE

00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:32.303
CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT A BRIGHT

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.806
LINE SIX YEARS OLD. AND THE

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:36.508
REASON THAT WE DID THAT WE

SAME CONCLUSION FIFTEEN YEARS

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.190
AGO. PARENTS AND DOCTORS WANT

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:53.691

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.459
INTERSEX CHILDREN'S BODIES

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:57.027
BECAUSE THEY DEEM IT MEDICALLY

00:39:57.094 --> 00:39:58.662
UNNECESSARY BASED ON THEIR FEAR

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:02.099
OF OUR HEALTHY BODIES. HOWEVER

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.667
WHAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.369
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT WE

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:07.872
ARE PERFECT AS WE ARE. THEY

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:09.140
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:11.175
CASES LIKE MINE AND SO MANY

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:11.776
OTHERS WERE SURGERY DOESN'T GO

00:40:11.842 --> 00:40:15.045
AS PLANNED. OR WHAT HAPPENS

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.046
YEARS LATER WHEN THEIR

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:17.381
DAUGHTERS REALIZE THAT THEY

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.150
CAN'T EXPERIENCE FOR SEXUAL

00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:20.518
PLEASURE. BECAUSE THAT RIGHT

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.153
WAS STOLEN FROM THEM WITHOUT

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:24.789
THEIR CONSENT. OR KNOWLEDGE.

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.190
THE UROLOGIST TO PERFORM MY

GENITALS APPEAR MORE NORMAL.

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:36.200

SAY IN THIS PERSONAL DECISION.

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:08.332
TO DETERMINE WHAT IF ANY

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:08.833
TREATMENT OR SURGERY IS

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:12.102
APPROPRIATE FOR US. THEY MAY

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.237
WELL THEY MAY BE WELL

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.972
INTENTIONED BUT THE SURGERIES

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:17.208
ARE OFTEN CARRIED OUT WITH THE

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:19.176
ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS WHAT

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:19.977
THE CHILDREN WHAT ONE AS

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:22.980
ADULTS. IN MY CASE I NEVER DID

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:25.015
USE MY **** IN THE WAY THAT THE

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:27.551
DOCTOR SOON I WOULD BECAUSE

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:28.118
MOST OF MY INTIMATE PARTNERS

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.954
HAVE BEEN CISGENDER WOMEN.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.223
INSTEAD OF PREPARE ME FOR ****

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.691
MY UROLOGIST COULD HAVE.

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:35.125
AFFIRMED THAT THAT THERE WAS

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:35.759
NOTHING WRONG WITH MY INTERSECT

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:39.063

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:40.831
IDENTIFIES INTERSECTS BEFORE I

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:44.001
EVEN KNEW WHAT THE TERM WAS. I

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:45.536
KNEW THAT I WAS DIFFERENT EVEN

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:47.171
THOUGH MY FAMILY AND MY DOCTORS

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:49.173
TRIED TO TRIED HARD TO CONVINCE

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.810
ME OTHERWISE. EVENTUALLY I

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.245
REALIZED THAT I WASN'T JUST A

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:55.746
NORMAL GIRL. THAT EVERYONE IN

FOR EVERYONE. IT IS IMPORTANT

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:04.989
FOR YOUNG INTERSEXUAL DURING.

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:05.923
TO GO THROUGH THE NATURAL

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.758
STAGES OF HUMAN AND CHARACTER

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:10.461
DEVELOPMENT BEFORE MAKING A

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:10.995
DECISION THAT COULD IMPACT

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:13.063
THEIR LIVES FOR EVER. BECAUSE

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.631
SOMETIMES CAN DOCTORS DO YOU

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:17.268
GET IT WRONG. I AM THE CHILD OF

00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:18.969
A MOTHER WHO TRULY THOUGHT SHE

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:19.603
WAS DOING WHAT WAS BEST FOR ME.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.406
BUT GOT IT WRONG. I HONESTLY

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:24.608
WOULD HAVE KEPT MY LARGE ****

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:25.175

PARTICIPATE IN THESE DECISIONS

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:50.367

ABOUT THE CHROMOSOMES ABOUT THE

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:38.548
GONADS IT'S ABOUT THE- PHYSICAL

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:39.816
APPEARANCE ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:43.519
TOGETHER. BUT WE SPEND ENORMOUS

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:44.687
AMOUNTS OF TIME AND OF SPENT

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:46.222
YEARS STUDYING THIS AND IT IS

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:48.224
AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX PROCESS

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.559
THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:51.461
AMOUNT OF CONCERN. WE'RE

00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:53.096
TALKING ABOUT TEN PEOPLE THREE

00:58:53.162 --> 00:58:55.665
OF WHICH- OUR PHYSICIANS THAT

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:57.267
MOST LIKELY ARE NOT FROM THE

00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:58.868
SPECIFIC SPECIALTIES THAT HAVE

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:01.204
SPENT ALL THIS TIME STUDYING

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:01.838
THESE CONDITIONS AND CONTINUING

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:05.174
TO STUDY THEM. THE BABY IS

00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:07.277
BORN- THERE IS NOTHING

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:09.345
IMMEDIATELY DONE FOR THE BABY

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.947
OTHER THAN MEDICAL TREATMENTS

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:12.048
THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.616
ESPECIALLY IN SITUATIONS SUCH

00:59:13.683 --> 00:59:16.386
AS SALT WASTING CH. OF THE BABY

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:17.754
WERE SENT HOME AND THIS WAS NOT

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:18.621
IDENTIFIED IN MEDICAL

00:59:18.688 --> 00:59:20.023
TREATMENTS WERE GIVEN THE BABY

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:21.791
WOULD WOULD DIE FROM A CRISIS

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:23.092
AT HOME. THEY CAN GET

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:25.561
INFECTIONS AND DIE FROM

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:26.829
OVERWHELMING STRESS AT THIS

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.631
CAUSES IN THE BODY. THERE ARE

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:30.667
ABSOLUTELY NO IMMEDIATE-

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:32.769
DECISIONS MADE AND THERE ARE

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:34.137
MULTIPLE VISITS IN MULTIPLE

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:37.206
CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILY

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:39.442
MEMBERS WITH MULTIPLE

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:42.979
PHYSICIANS OF ALL SPECIAL. ON

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:45.415
A- US. THREE AND IN FACT. VERY

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.182
RARELY ARE WE ACTUALLY TALKING

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.483
ABOUT SURGERY THAT IS JUST AN

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.618
OPTION AND IF WE EXCLUDE THESE

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:50.553
OPTIONS WILL HAVE PATIENTS NOT

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.555
WALKING INTO OUR DOORS AND IN

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:54.324
FACT. GOING ELSEWHERE IN IN IN

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.391
IT WILL BE THAT PEOPLE WITH

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:57.994
LESS MEANS THAT ARE UNABLE TO

00:59:58.061 --> 01:00:01.264
TRAVEL TO OTHER PLACES TO HAVE-

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.732
THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL IN

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:05.201
FACT SUFFER BUT THE PEOPLE WHO

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:05.768
STILL WANT SURGERY AND KNOW

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:06.402
THAT IT'S THERE ARE GOING TO GO

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:08.538
ELSEWHERE. FOR US THIS IS NOT

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.406
ABOUT SURGERY WE DON'T WE'RE

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.775
NOT HERE FOR SURGERY OR AGAINST

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:13.943
SURGERY AND THAT'S EXTREMELY

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.578
IMPORTANT AND WE'RE NOT.

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:18.948
PERFORMING THE SURGERIES. THAT

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:21.718
ARE BEING INSINUATED- WE ARE

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:25.321
OFFERING. ALL MEDICAL TREATMENT

01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:27.090
OPTIONS AND IN FACT WHEN WE ARE

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:29.192
UNSURE OF DIAGNOSES THE

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:30.393
MAJORITY OF THE TIME AND

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.894
CLINICS SUCH AS THIS THAT ARE

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.363
AT. MULTI THAT MULTI DISCIPLINE

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:35.098
CONNECTS OUR AT OUR AT ACADEMIC

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.367
CENTERS WHEN WE ARE ENSURE WE

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:38.634
ARE WE ARE NOT OFFERING

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.136
SURGERY. IT'S IT WE ARE

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:42.105
DISCUSSING SURGERY AND THAT IS

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.106
AND WE'RE NOT PUSHING IT IT'S

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:44.707
AN OPTION OKAY SIDE OF AYE

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.476
CLARIFIED BECAUSE WHEN. ONE OF

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:49.278
THE CONTENTIONS WAS IS THAT.

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:49.879
PHYSICIANS ARE PUSHING ACT BE

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.781
PUSHING PERRANCE THING THAT YOU

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:52.715
NEED TO HAVE SURGERY TO FIX

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.184
THIS YOU'RE SAYING THAT. I MEAN

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:55.985
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIRTY

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.453
YEARS AGO AND I'VE YOU KNOW IS

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.988
WHAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:02.191
THIS LAWS ABOUT NOW AND INTO

01:01:02.258 --> 01:01:02.792
THE FUTURE RIGHT AND ONE. YEAH

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.794
ONE OF THE- MOST IMPORTANT

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.796
THINGS ABOUT BEING A SURGEON IS

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:09.032
NEVER PUSHING AN AGENDA OR A

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:10.666
SURGERY THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.335
HOW WE- THAT'S NOT HOW WE

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.470
OPERATE IT'S AND IT'S IMPORTANT

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:17.073
TO MAKE SURE. THAT THAT THE

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.574
DECISION IS MADE AND IT'S AN

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.842
INFORMED DECISION THAT'S MADE

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.677
TOGETHER THERE'S SHARED

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.379
DECISION MAKING THAT OCCURS

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.081
WITH THE FAMILY. AND KNOW WHERE

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:26.916
WE ARE PUSHING ANY AGENDA IT'S

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:29.685
ABOUT OPTIONS AND EDUCATION-

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:32.388
AND ANY THEN YOU JUST CLARIFY-

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:34.323
SO ONE OF THE SITUATIONS THAT I

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:37.260
THINK THE PROPONENTS HAVE

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:37.794
EXPRESSED CONCERN I THINK

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.395
REASONABLE CONCERN IS THAT OKAY.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.764
CHILD BORN PARENT. ANXIOUS

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:42.899
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU ASKED OAK

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.567
HILL THAT THAT MIGHT MY ANSWER

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:45.568
TO PEOPLE AS KIDS LIKE LET'S

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:46.803
WRAP OR SCORE THE MOST USED AS

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.871
BOY OR GIRL RIGHT. AND THEN

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:51.274
THEY GET AND- THEY WANT TO BE

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.142
ABLE TO GET AN ANSWER AND SOON

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.877
CERTAIN PARENTS THE ONLY

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:56.846
DEPENDING ON THEIR BACKGROUND-

01:01:56.913 --> 01:02:00.416
ARE- SO FORTH MAY WANT TO. PUSH

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.618
FOR SURGERY TO RESOLVE THAT

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:03.820
QUESTION HAVE YOU AND YOUR PS

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.455
CRAWLERS HAVE YOU EVER TOLD.

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.890
NOT MAYBE IT'S BEST TO WAIT WE

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.192
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:10.393
TO BE RESOLVED RIGHT NOW I MEAN

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.894
IT DO YOU ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.196
SURGERY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT IT'S

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.230
AN APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHILD

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.399
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND IN

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:17.934
FACT WE DON'T EVEN ASSIGNED

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.569
GENDERS WHEN WORKERS. WE TALK

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:22.171
ABOUT THE BABY. TALK ABOUT FOR

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:25.408
RIGHT NOW IT'S SO MUCH HARDER

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.110
TO ASSIGN A GENDER AND COME

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:28.277
BACK WITH OUR OF SO MANY

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.645
THINGS. THAT WEREN'T SURE ABOUT

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:34.617
THIS SUCH A COMPLEX ISSUE. AND

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:39.055
OF COURSE WE WANT RIGHT THERE

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:44.026
WE NEVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING WE

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:54.704
FULLY ARMY. ANY ANY. THERE IS A

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.706
SIGNED AND REFERRING TO THE TO

01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:59.041
THE CHILD AS THE BABY. AND THEN

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.476
THAT FURTHER TESTING WILL NEED

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.378
TO HAPPEN INCLUDING A GENETIC

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.046
TESTING HORMONAL TESTING AND

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:06.315
THEN WE HAVE A VERY SUPPORTIVE

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:08.317
ENVIRONMENT WE CAN LEARN MORE

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:09.852
ABOUT THIS WE DO A LINE THEM

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.522
WITH- ORGANIZATIONS WITH THEY

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:13.523
CAN TALK TO OTHER FAMILIES ARE

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.224
ALSO GOING THROUGH THESE

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:18.127
THINGS. OKAY AND THEN FINALLY.

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:20.229
SO SOMEONE MIGHT SAY OKAY WELL

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:21.264
YOU KNOW THIS IF THAT'S WHAT

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.032
YOU DO THIS BILL DOESN'T. DO

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.767
ANYTHING STOP YOU FROM DOING

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.435
THAT SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:27.637
THIS BILL SO WHAT WHAT IS IT

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:30.473
WHAT WOULD THIS BILL IT BECAME

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.040
LAW STOP YOU FROM DOING THAT

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.409
MIGHT BE HARMFUL TO THE CHILD.

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:35.545
WELL FIRST OF ALL AGAIN. I

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.380
THINK IT TAKES AWAY THE ABILITY

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.415
TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.083
THINGS AND PERCENT OPTIONS. IN

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.852
INFORMED THAT THE FAMILY

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:45.788
MEMBERS. IT ALSO IS VERY BROAD

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:48.824
AND IN IN OUR OPINION IS GOES

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:51.494
WELL BEYOND WHAT WE KNOW. TO

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:54.363
MEAN INTERSEX AND WE WILL

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.898
CERTAINLY SAY THAT THIS IS A

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:58.501
THIS IS OF A VERY QUIET COMPLEX

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:01.771
CONDITION OF MANY CONDITIONS

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:04.340
THAT THE POTENTIALLY CAN- MAKE

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:06.375
UP THE DEFINITION OF INTERSEX

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:08.110
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE SUCH

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:09.712
VARIATIONS IN THE INCIDENCE OF

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:11.414
INTERNET INTERSEX WILL. WILL

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.350
HEAR OF ANYWHERE FROM. 1% TWO

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.552
VERSES ONE AND A FORTY FIVE

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:18.120
HUNDRED WHICH WOULD BE MORE-

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:20.256
REALISTIC AND HOW WE VIEW

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:23.593
INTERSECTS BUT CERTAINLY. TO AS

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:25.294
YOU HEARD EARLIER THERE ARE BY

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.264
MANY PEOPLE- WITH A CH THE DO

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:31.200
NOT FEEL THAT INTERSEX- IS AT

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.568
THAT CH IS AN INTERSEX

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:33.970
CONDITION AND IN FACT THERE ARE

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:37.406
STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THAT 95%

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:40.309
OF- OF FIVE C. H. PATIENTS THAT

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:43.980
ARE- RAISED AS FEMALE IDENTIFY

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:45.481
AS FEMALE AND A FEW PRCENT.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:49.318
HAVE A GENDER ISSUES- ABOUT ONE

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.887
PERCENT- AND THAT'S A

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.623
DOCUMENTED STUDY ACTUALLY IN

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:55.891
THE REPORT FOR TWO THOUSAND AND

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.860
FIVE- BYE DESTINED IN

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:01.631
COLLEAGUES. AND ALSO-

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.032
HYPOSPADIAS HYPOSPADIAS IS IN

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.200
AND OF ITSELF A VERY COMPLEX

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.368
ISSUE YES SOMETIMES IT IS

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.870
ASSOCIATED WITH INTERSEX BUT-

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:10.706
ABOVE AND BY FAR. THE MAJORITY

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.808
OF HYPE IS BADIUS THAT WE SEE

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.810
AND TREAT I IS NOT A PART OF AN

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.379
INNER SIX CONDITION AND I

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:19.415
THINK. TO LIMIT US IN AND BUY A

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.350
BROADLY SAYING AND INCLUDING

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.286
THOSE THOSE SAID BOTH CH

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.788
HYPOSPADIAS OR EVEN TRYING TO.

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:28.124
NAIL DOWN SPECIFIC DIAGNOSES

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.425
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ALREADY

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:31.661
CONFUSION AND THAT AND SO I

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:36.899
HAVE EXTREME- CONCERNED THAT IF

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.734
WE LEGISLATE THIS ISSUE THAT

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:42.104
THERE ARE TO BE A GENERATION OF

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:42.638
CHILDREN. WHOSE PURPOSE ON

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:47.643
CONSEQUENCES. BUT WE ARE. OKAY

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:51.280
SO- I'VE KATE. BY YOUR

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:52.748
RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS-

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:55.184
NIGHT. I THANK THE BROADNESS IS

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.620
A BIT CONCERNING I. AGAIN AN

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.154
EXAMPLE THAT AND FOR CHAD

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.056
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THAT

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:01.691
IS THAT WE A CHILD WHO IS BORN-

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:03.192
THE PARENTS REQUESTED A

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.760
CIRCUMCISION I KNOW THERE'S

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.429
PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MIGHT FEEL

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:07.363
CIRCUMCISION IS A MEDICALLY

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:10.533
UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE. AND

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:11.233
WHILE PERFORMING THE ARKHAM

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.369
CITY DISCOVER THE CHAO'S TYPE

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.538
STATUS SO WE CAN TELL BEFORE.

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:16.672
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT OUT

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:19.475
AND- PUT. DECISION TO PERFORM

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.944
THE CONCISION BECAUSE THEY

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:23.245
PERFORM THE PROCEDURE THAT SOME

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.314
PEOPLE WOULD. FIGHT AS MEDICAL

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:28.484
NECESSARY. NOW YES. BECAUSE

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.353
THAT OUT ALSO HAS TYPE OF SPEED

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:31.821
IS NOW WE DISCOVERED IT DURING

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.456
THE IT WAS NOT HAVE TO BE

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:34.623
SEVERELY COVERED DURING THE

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:35.958
PERFORMANCE OF THE

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:38.994
CIRCUMCISION. BUT I THINK THE

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:42.098
BIGGER EASE IS IT IS HIS BEST

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:46.268
BET CONCERNING. NOW ARE

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:46.836
CERTAINLY FALL UNDER MEDICAL

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:50.339
TREATMENT. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:51.607
THAT YOU KNOW I THINK FIFTY AND

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:52.508
TEN THE BILL AND WHERE WE WANT

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:54.510
TO GO IS IN LINE WITH I THINK

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:55.644
WE'RE THE MEDICAL PROFESSION

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:56.946
WANTS TO GO FOR THE STRAIGHT

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:57.446
TALK TO MAC MANY MY OWN

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:57.980
COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDICAL

01:06:58.047 --> 01:06:59.248
PROFESSION- I THINK THE CONCERN

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.616
IS THAT THE LAWS A BLUNT

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.218
INSTRUMENT. AND TRYING TO PUT

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:04.620
SOMETHING LIKE THIS INTO LAW

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.088
AND IT'S NOT LIKE BECAUSE I

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.590
KNOW BUT ALSO IS COME UP IS FOR

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.124
EXAMPLE CONVERSION THERAPY

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.392
THERE IS. PRETTY MUCH IN AN

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:11.861
ENTITY AS MUCH AS THERE CAN BE

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.929
IN THE YOU KNOW ABOUT COLON AT

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:14.630
ALL TO FASHION A CONVERSION

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:17.233
THERAPY IS BUNK AND THAT IT I'M

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:21.404
FULL ON THAT SO FORTH. AND IF

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.204
YOU THIS SPACE WITHIN WERE

01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:22.738
TRYING TO SWEEP OF A LOT

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.306
DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S A LOT

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.108
OF. GOOD REASONS FOR THIS THAT

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:28.110
THAT WAS AN INTENT OF THE BILL.

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:34.850
BUT I THINK CONCERNS IT'S ALSO

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:35.718
WE CAN ALLOW OTHERS. THAT

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:41.490
EIGHTY. I THINK SO MUCH OKAY.

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.525
THAT JUST MONTH PLEASE I WANT

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:43.726
TO GO TO OTHER SENATORS BUT I

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.261
DO WILL DO A FOLLOW UP TO

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:46.629
DOCTOR COP IN IN MAY BE UNFAIR

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:48.831
BUT- TO ASK YOU THIS A GIVEN

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.466
YOU HAVE A IF YOU PRACTICE AT

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:54.470
UCSF. BUT A CRITICISM OF THESE

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:55.237
PROCEDURES AT THE SUPPORTERS

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:56.806
SAY THAT THE SURGERIES ARE

01:07:56.872 --> 01:07:57.840
OCCURRING AT A MAJOR HOSPITALS

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.109
ACROSS THE STATE- CHALLENGING

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:01.644
YOUR ASSERTION INTERNET NOT

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:05.181
WHAT YOU DO AT UCSF BUT CAN YOU

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.349
SPEAK TO WHETHER THESE ARE

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:11.220
OCCURRING IN OTHER HOSPITALS.

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:13.722
WELL I THERE ARE. ACROSS YOU

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.324
ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:16.392
THE UNITED STATES FOR THAT

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.727
MATTER THESE- DST MULTI

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:22.231
DISCIPLINARY CLINICS- EXIST ON

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:24.867
A IT ALL OF THE ACADEMIC. THE

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.202
MAJORITY THE ACADEMICS AS WITH

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:28.771
IN CALIFORNIA- I THINK THE

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:33.576
PROBLEM WITH. THE END ANSWERING

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:36.278
YOUR QUESTION IS AGAIN WHAT. IT

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.980
IS WHICH SURGERIES YOU'RE

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:39.882
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:42.918
MEDICALLY INDICATED-

01:08:42.985 --> 01:08:46.355
INTERVENTIONS FOR- WIN THE

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:48.924
URETHRA AND THE **** ARE ARE

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.392
ARE A SINGLE CHANNEL THE EXIT

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:52.495
ON TO THE PERINEUM WHICH IS

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:53.896
THIS OUT OUTER SURFACE OF THE

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:57.366
BODY. AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:59.635
THIS THESE CHANNELS ARE

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.637
SEPARATED NOT ONLY TO LIMIT

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:03.606
URINARY TRACT INFECTION BUT YOU

01:09:03.672 --> 01:09:04.807
COULD IMAGINE MENSTRUATING

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.309
THROUGH A SINGLE HOLE AND

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:08.310
PLACING A TAMPON AND HOW DO YOU

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:11.380
HOW DO YOU URINATE- OF FILLING

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:15.718
AT THAT YOU. POOR DRAINAGE AND-

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:17.386
STATE STENOSIS WHICH IS NEARING

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:19.822
OF THAT CHANNEL CAN- AGAIN

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:21.090
BECAUSE DIFFICULTY WITH

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:22.825
URINATION IN THE URINE GOING UP

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.494
INTO THE **** AND UTERUS AND

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:28.297
DILATING THE **** OVERTIME-

01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:31.100
THOSE SURGERIES OF MOST LIKELY

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:36.171
PERFORMED AT- IT INSTITUTIONS

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.706
ACROSS CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:40.809
WELL LET ME TRY TO NARROW UNDER

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:43.012
YOUR DEFINITION OF INTERSECTS

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.613
AND I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE IT. SO

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.648
THE IN ON YOU MISSION OKAY AND

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.149
I KNOW WE'LL GET TO THAT BUT

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:47.917
UNDER YOUR DEFINITION OF WHAT

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:51.654
INTEREST SEXY IS NOT OTHER

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.254
PROCEDURES THAT AS WE TALKING

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:56.959
ABOUT. ARE THOSE ARE. ARE THOSE

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.694
PROCEDURES HAPPENING AT AT-

01:09:58.761 --> 01:09:59.361
WITHOUT THE SAME

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.095
INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH THAT

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:01.931
YOU HAVE AT UCSF AND AT OTHER

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:02.565
HOSPITALS FACILITIES AROUND THE

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:05.100
STATE. I DON'T THINK THAT I

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:09.305
COULD. FOR CERTAIN COMMENT ON

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:10.205
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:11.740
OCCURRING AT OTHER I THINK THE

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:12.908
MAJORITY RIGHT THEN THE TRADE

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.511
DEFINITELY WHEN A CHILD IS BORN

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.680
WITH THE INTERSECTS DEFINITION

01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:19.582
AS YOU DEFINE IT. IS THAT

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:20.649
SOMETHING THAT IS TYPICALLY A

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:22.851
SURPRISE OR IS IT SOMETHING

01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:25.454
THAT IS TYPICALLY A SCENE-

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:28.190
DURING THE PREGNANCY SO THAT

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.124
WHEN THAT CHILD IS BORN UNDER

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.125
YOUR DEFINITION INTEREST TAX

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:33.495
THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITIES

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:36.131
WHERE OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. SO

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:38.767
THAT ALSO. WILL GIVE A COMPLEX

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:40.469
ANSWER A CASE SOMETIMES WE WILL

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:41.837
KNOW ABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS BEFORE

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:42.905
THE CHILD IS BORN AND OTHER

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.940
TIMES WE WON'T SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:45.908
IN A CHILD WITH. THAT IS

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:47.343
PREVIOUSLY HAD A SIBLING BORN

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.978
WAS CH THERE'S A HIGH

01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:50.379
LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT AND OTHER

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:52.181
THAN OTHER CHILD WILL BE BORN

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.949
WITH CH. THERE OCCASIONALLY

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:55.317
TIMES WHEN WE CAN SEE ON

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:58.954
PRENATAL ULTRASOUND. THE CHILD

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:00.956
LOOKS LIKE IT HAS OF A PHALLIC

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.192
LIKE TRUE WOULD BE A- NUMBER TO

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.793
**** BUT THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:05.594
SHOWS THAT THEIR EXECS. THERE

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:06.261
OCCASIONALLY TIMES WHEN WERE

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:08.364
ALERTED. AHEAD OF TIME BUT

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.798
THERE ARE ALSO TIMES WHEN A

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:12.801
CHILD IS BORN- AND THAT. WE ARE

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.403
THAT IT ISN'T IT IS NOT KNOWN

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.138
THAT THE CHILD. IS INTERSEX

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:17.773
UNTIL THE CHILD IS BORN NOT ALL

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.408
OF MEDICAL CARE IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:20.776
HAPPENS IN OUR MAJOR URBAN

01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:22.077

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:19.061
PERSPECTIVE AND I WOULD HOPE

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.562

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:24.399
ALSO RESPOND TO THESE QUESTIONS

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:25.000

SIDED AT. AT THE CENTER LEYVA

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.405

AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.181
UROLOGY AT THE ICAHN SCHOOL OF

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.549

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:45.120
RESEARCH TEACHING ARE FOCUSED

OF SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN ADULTS

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:52.194
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT A

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.496
PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST. BUT I WAS

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.964
FIRST EXPOSED TO THE

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:57.332
CONTROVERSY AROUND SURGICAL

01:13:57.399 --> 01:14:00.302
MANAGEMENT OF INTERSEX. EARLY

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:01.303
IN MY MEDICAL CAREER WISE

APPLYING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL I'M

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:04.940
AND THIS AWARENESS MOTIVATED

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.275
NOT ONLY MY INTERESTING GOING

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:09.745
INTO UROLOGY BUT ALSO MY

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.380
DECISION TO DEFER RESIDENCY. TO

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.848
FIRST PURSUE A FELLOWSHIP AND

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:15.384
DEGREE IN BIOETHICS SO I BRING

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:17.052
A BOTH THOSE PERSPECTIVES TO

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.188
OUR DISCOURSE TODAY. ON A

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:22.658
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT CAME UP.

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:23.992
IN THE COURSE OF THAT THE BACK

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:26.495
AND FORTH ON. SO MANY I TRIED

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:27.429
TO TAKE NOTES SO I WOULD MISS

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.530
ANYTHING BUT FORGIVE ME I MIGHT

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:32.067
HAVE TO CIRCLE BACK AS OUR

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.435
CONVERSATION CONTINUES. ON YEAH

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:39.641

THIS ARE TO THIS BILL- THERE

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.513
WAS A CONFLATION OF MEDICAL AND

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.914
SURGICAL CARE AND I THINK IT'S

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:49.218
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.720
RECOGNIZE THAT NO ONE NOTHING

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:54.423
IN THIS BILL IS LIMITING

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:58.927
MEDICAL CARE FOR THESE PATIENTS

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:01.830
DIAGNOSED WITH THE SP ON. THE

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.131
TO CONTINUE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:05.834
TALKING ABOUT LIMITING SURGERY

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:08.437
IS DONE BEFORE SIX YEARS OF AGE

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:13.375
ON. THE HERE QUESTION THAT WAS

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:15.043
RAISED OF IDENTIFYING A HYPE

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:16.411
THE SPEEDIEST AT THE MOMENT OF

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:19.147
CIRCUMCISION ON THAT IS

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.549
EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL WHICH

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:23.452
VERY EXPLICIT LEAD DOES NOT

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:25.354
ADDRESS QUESTIONS OF DESPITE

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.592
THE SPEEDIEST ON HERE WITH. THE.

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.628
QUESTION OF WHAT IS AND IS NOT

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:36.365
MEDICALLY NEEDED- IT IS OF

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:39.735
COURSE A VERY THORNY ONE ON AND.

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.503
IT WAS CERTAINLY THE- THERE IS

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.472
ROOM FOR CRITICISM OF THE

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:44.940
BILL'S PROPOSAL THAT'D BE

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:47.175
PUSHED TO A MULTI DISCIPLINARY

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:50.078
TEAM UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:54.950
MEDICAL BOARD. YOU FOR EXAMPLE

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:57.319
DR **** MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:58.120
THE UROGENITAL SINUS WHERE

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.689
THERE IS A COMBINED CHANNEL FOR

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:02.991
THE EXIT OF URINE AND MEN SEIZE

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:05.294
ON THAT ISSUE OF THE MENSTRUAL

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.063
FLUID BEING A BEING A

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.766
PROBLEMATIC ON DOESN'T ARISE.

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:13.669
BEFORE AGE SIX CHILDREN OR ARE

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:14.603
YOU EVEN WITH THAT IT'S GETTING

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:17.272
EARLIER AND EARLIER- YOU KNOW

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:19.641
THAT IS NOT THE USUAL SITUATION

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:21.376
AND THAT A SIX YEAR OLD IS

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:22.711
GOING TO BE GRAPPLING WITH THAT

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.580
PROBLEM. AND SO THERE IS SPACE

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:28.617
TO PAUSE WITHOUT INJURY TO

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:31.987
THESE CHILDREN ON AND FINALLY I

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:33.622
SAID THE TERM INVENTIONS OF

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:36.091
VERY VERY ASTUTELY THAT MULTI

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:38.894
DISCIPLINARY TEAMS ARE

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.096
SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:43.565
CERTAINLY OUR OUR PROFESSION

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:46.601
THAT HAS- CALLED FOR NOW. FOR A

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.603
VERY LONG TIME BUT THE

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.672
UNFORTUNATE REALITY IS THAT

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:52.274
THEY ARE OBSERVE MORE IN THE

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:54.109
BREACH THAN IN THE OBSERVANCE

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:56.311
OF WONDERFUL ACADEMIC CENTERS

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:59.948
LIKE UCSF YES HAVE YOU ROBUST

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:01.883
AND TRULY MULTI DISCIPLINARY

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:04.653
TEAMS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.955
EVEN AT MOST ACADEMIC MEDICAL

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.724
CENTER IS. A MULTI DISCIPLINARY

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.660
TEAM IS A UROLOGIST AN

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:14.997
ENDOCRINOLOGIST AND NOT THE

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:17.466
FULL ARRAY OF PERSONNEL THAT

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:20.402
DOCTOR COP DESCRIBES AT UCSF

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:51.199
ISSUE AND CHILDREN WILL SUFFER

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:53.668
PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES IF THIS

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:56.338
BILL PASSES I WOULD NOT AGREE

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:57.172
WITH THAT AND SAY THAT I THINK

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.607
THAT CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING

01:17:58.673 --> 01:17:59.374
PROPELLANT PROFOUND

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:02.277
CONSEQUENCES NOW. I THINK THE

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:03.979
BILL YOU YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:06.148
ON IT I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL

01:18:06.214 --> 01:18:07.983
AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT I'D

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.684
LIKE TO SEE WHAT DO SOME MORE

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:10.585
WORK ON IT I THINK IT IS AN

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:12.220
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX ISSUE BUT

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.889
IT'S PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WE'RE

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.557
TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN'S LIVES

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.059
TO BECOME ADULTS AND IF WE

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:19.461
DON'T GET IT RIGHT THEN THERE

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:22.831
ARE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES SO- I

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.399
HEAR BOTH SIDES YOU'RE BOTH

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:27.169
VERY PASSIONATE I DO WORRY THAT

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.905
AT- AT THAT HOSPITAL IS NOT A

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:33.075
TEACHING HOSPITAL. THAT MAYBE

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:35.677
THERE ISN'T THE- JUST THE

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:36.611
ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE ISSUE

01:18:36.678 --> 01:18:38.713
THAT IS GIVEN AT- AT A HOSPITAL

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:41.917
LIKE UCSF. AND IF WE EVER HAD

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:43.452
JUST LEADERS CAN'T DO SOMETHING

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:44.953
TO HELP THE PROCESS AND TRY TO

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.988
GET IT RIGHT. THE BIG ISSUE WE

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:47.923
DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT SO

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:49.624
THIS AS US AND WIENER SAID THIS

01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:51.660
IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE.

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.862
AND IT HAS A LONG WAY TO GO AND

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:55.130
I ALWAYS LIKE TO THINK THAT IS

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:56.465
BILLS MOVE THROUGH EACH POLICY

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:57.299
COMMITTEE THEY GET A LITTLE

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:59.901
BETTER HOPEFULLY- BUT I'D LIKE

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:01.736
A SISSY TO CONTINUE THIS

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:02.737
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SUCH A

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:05.407
HUGE HUGE. ISSUE AND AS A NEW

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.609
GRANDMOTHER- THERE'S THINGS

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.144
THAT YOU LEARN IN THIS JOB THAT

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:10.345
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHEN YOU HAD

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:11.480
YOUR OWN CHILDREN I DIDN'T KNOW

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:13.515
ANYTHING ABOUT INTERSEX. AND I

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:14.883
REMEMBER YOU KNOW SHE'S THREE

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:17.252
MONTHS OLD THINKING. WOW I

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:17.819
WONDER IF THIS IS SOMETHING

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.387
THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:20.622
AND THINKING ABOUT TALKING

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:23.091
ABOUT THE BABY AS A BABY. AND

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:25.460
NOT AS A HE OR A SHE AND HOW

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:27.629
IMPORTANT THAT IS AT AS ONE OF

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:29.097
THE WITNESSES I THINK WAS PRE

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:32.067
TESTIFIED- A BIT YOU KNOW. WE

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.402
DON'T FOCUS ON A HEALTHY BABY

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:36.338
SOMETIMES WE TOO MUCH FOCUS ON

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:39.174
IS THAT A BOY IS THAT A GIRL

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:39.774
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:40.809
DOESN'T LOOK EXACTLY LIKE A BOY

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:44.279
OR GIRL. WE TO FREAK OUT- SO I

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:45.914
THINK OF IT ONE OF THE

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:49.317
BENEFITS- IN JOB AND IN THIS

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:51.753
BILL. IS THAT WE GET OUT THERE

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:52.587
THAT THE PUBLIC IS NOT USED TO

01:19:52.654 --> 01:19:53.889
TALKING ABOUT. AND I APPLAUD

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.223
THE WITNESSES WHO CAME AND

01:19:55.290 --> 01:20:00.162
pSTORIES BECAUSE THAT'S EASY TO

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:02.564
DO BUT IT MAKES US SMARTER.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:05.634
SAYS LEGISLATOR. SO THANK YOU

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.101

A FEW MORE TWEAKS TO THE BILL

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:11.640
AND MAYBE NARROW THE SCOPE. BUT

A WEEK SO BY TWO BY MAKING THAT

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.654

BASED ON THEIR GENDER IN THE

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:45.300
FUTURE DOT THAT'S WHY THESE

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:46.801
PERMANENT DECISIONS CAN BE SO

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:47.835
CATASTROPHIC FOR PEOPLE CAUGHT

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:49.704

THAT THAT- CONCLUSION COULD BE

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:56.044
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:59.247
THAT ALL THOSE. CHILDREN WHO

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:00.715

CASES WHERE. YOU'RE UNHAPPY

01:27:14.095 --> 01:27:15.997
WITH THAT PROCEDURE BEING DONE.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.265
HOW DO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:18.466
THOSE OTHERS WHERE THAT

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:20.034
PROCEDURE ACTUALLY. ENHANCE

ALSO A POSITIVE. AND WE DO

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:26.574
THAT. BY SAYING THAT WHEN

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.877

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:31.012
LOOK AT AND WHAT WE DO IN THIS

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.314
LEGISLATURE. EVERY DAY. AND

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.350
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ALL OF US.

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.418
IS THERE THERE ARE SOME PIECES

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:38.419
THAT THERE'S SOME ISSUES THAT

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:40.455
ARE SO CLEAR CUT. THERE ARE

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:41.823
OTHER ISSUES WHERE THERE ARE

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:44.325
YOU NOT IT'S NOT. AS YOU KNOW

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:45.593
THERE THERE ARE BALANCING

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.128
EQUITIES. AND THE QUESTION IS

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:48.796
AYE AYE WE AGREED THERE ARE

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:51.299
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SURGERY.

01:27:51.366 --> 01:27:52.834
TWO YEARS LATER ARE. REALLY

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.636
HAPPY THAT THEY HAD THE SURGERY

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:55.269
WE'RE NOT DISPUTING THAT. WE'RE

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:57.739
NOT TRYING TO ERASE THEM. THERE

01:27:57.805 --> 01:27:59.674
ARE SOME EFFORTS TO ERASE

01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:01.876
INTERSEX PEOPLE. AND MINIMIZE

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.144
THEM BUT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO A

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:04.145
RACE OF PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:06.648
SATISFIED WITH THE SURGERY. BUT

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:07.215
THE QUESTION IS IF YOU HAVE

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:10.818
SOMEONE WHO. HOW NEAT ONCE THE

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:12.253
SURGERY AND CAN. THE LADY AT

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.321
THE SIX DOESN'T PREVENT THEM

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:15.323
FROM HAVING IT. AND THEN THEY

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.890
GO ON THEIR PUT THEIR LIVES.

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:18.526
FIRST IS THE PERSON WHO. HAS

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.428
THE SURGERY IS A BABY. AND THEN

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:21.863
WITH THE ROLE AND ARE NOT

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:23.931
SATISFIED WITH THE AND IT'S TOO

01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:24.499
LATE THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING

01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:25.199
ABOUT IT. WE'RE THE EQUITIES

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:28.002
LIE. THE THERE'S ONLY ONE GROUP

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:30.138
THERE. WHO ARE WHO IF YOU CAN

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.240
NOT MAKE THAT CHANGE IN THE

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:33.608
FUTURE BECAUSE THE DECISIONS

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:34.542
MADE FOR THEM. SO IN THE

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:37.578
EQUITIES OR PRETTY CLEAR HERE

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:40.548
ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. OKAY

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:41.182
I APPRECIATE YEAR.

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:42.650
CLARIFICATION AT SOME PLACE WE

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:44.452
MAY HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES ON. I

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:45.720
SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT SOMEONE

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:47.422
BEING GAY AT THAT SEXUAL

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:48.356
ORIENTATION I DIDN'T MAKE

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.657
IMMEDIATE AND IMPLIES THAT NOT

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.759

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:53.394
OF OUR COMMUNITY AND I

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:55.830
APPRECIATE THAT. ALL RIGHT-

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:57.632
THIS IS THE SECOND THAT. THE

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:58.866
SECOND PLACE THAT THE THIRD

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.201
PLACE TODAY MAYBE YOU COULD

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.236
SPEAK TO IS THAT. IN YOUR BILL

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:04.605
IT PUTS LIMITATIONS ON WHAT.

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:08.743
PROCEDURES CAN CAN- GO FORWARD-

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:09.944
AND BUT YOU DEFEND YOU CREATIVE

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.646
COMMITTEE IN THE MEDICAL BOARD

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:12.914
TO DO THAT GOT TO PROVIDE THAT

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.249
GUIDANCE BUT- BUT YOUR BILL

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:18.252
SAYS THAT THE PROCEDURE CANNOT

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:18.853
CARRY ANY. MEANINGFUL RISK OF

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.522
HARM. THAT'S A VERY BROAD

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:23.725
DEFINITION. OF WHERE THINGS CAN

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:25.259
BE DONE I MEAN IT'S ALMOST

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:26.394
NOTHING YOU CAN DO IN THAT AND

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:27.662
WE CAN INVITE OUR MEDICAL

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.397
PROFESSIONALS HERE TO. ADVISE

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:30.465
ON THIS BUT THERE'S ALMOST

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:31.733
NOTHING THAT ONE CAN DO.

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:33.735
MEDICALLY THAT DOESN'T CREATE

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:35.470
SOME. POTENTIAL FOR HARM COULD

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:36.571
YOU SPEAK TO THAT YEAH SURE A

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:38.239
AND I THINK THE REASON FOR THAT

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.908
IN SHORT IS THAT WE ARE. NOT

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.243
GIVING THE MEDICAL BOARD THIS

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:44.011
IS ALREADY TO CRAFT. THE

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:46.347
STANDARDS. BUT WE ARE ALSO

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:48.382
GUIDING IT BY SAYING THAT WE

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:50.785
DON'T. IT THAT IF SOMETHING IN

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:51.486
TERMS OF WHAT'S MEDICALLY

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:53.788
NECESSARY BECAUSE WE ARE ERRING

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:54.255
ON THE SIDE OF BEING.

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:56.591
RESTRICTIVE WHEN THERE IS NOT.

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:58.960

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:55.363
MIDEAST HEARD THE RESOLUTION

01:33:55.429 --> 01:33:56.430
AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THERE WAS

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:57.064
A POSITION THAT YOU CASF DOCTOR

01:33:57.131 --> 01:34:00.101
BASKIN WHO CAME UP REPEATEDLY

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:01.802
AND IT WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR THE

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:03.504
SURGERIES WERE BEING PERFORMED

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:05.272
HE STOPPED COMING OUT OF

01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:06.307
BECAUSE HE WAS SAYING SOME

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:10.211
REALLY. OVER THE TOP THINGS ARE

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:14.115
NOT HIS FROM UCSF. AND WE KNOW

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:15.683
THAT MEDI CAL AND THIS IS THIS

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:16.484
IS A LITTLE BIT OVER BROAD IN

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:17.818
TERMS THE CATEGORY. BUT FIFTEEN

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:19.487
SINCE 200-041-5000 SURGERIES

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:20.855
HAVE BEEN PERFORMED. SOME OF

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:21.889
THOSE HAVE BEEN MEDICALLY

01:34:21.956 --> 01:34:23.691
NECESSARY AND SOME OF THOSE ARE

01:34:23.758 --> 01:34:24.992
DISTAL HYPE STATUS WOULD BE

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:26.994
TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL. BUT AS

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.562
OF THE LOWER NUMBER THE FIFTEEN

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:30.231
THOUSAND. IT'S NOT ZERO AND

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:32.400
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ZERO YES

01:34:32.466 --> 01:34:33.968
IT WAS WORSE THIRTY YEARS AGO I

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:35.936
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THE MEDICAL

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:38.339
PROFESSION. IS A BALDING ON

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:39.974
THIS AND I COMMEND THE MEDICAL

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:41.809
PROFESSION REVOLVING ON THIS.

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:44.378
BUT THAT EVOLUTION IS NOT

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:45.312
COMPLETE THE SURGERIES ARE

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:46.580
STILL HAPPENING WHEN THEY'RE

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:49.850
NOT. MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY I

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:54.221
ALSO- AGREE- WITH THE DOCTOR

01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:56.090
THAT THE PHYSICIANS WILL NOT

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:58.325
WILLFULLY HARM ANYONE I THINK-

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:00.394
I. MEAN THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF

01:35:00.461 --> 01:35:01.762
PHYSICIANS WANT TO DO RIGHT BY

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:03.564
THEIR PATIENTS. HI THIS IS NOT

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:06.100
ABOUT WILL FULLY HARMING- BUT

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:08.769
THIS IS ABOUT HARM. DOES HAPPEN

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:11.072
AS A RESULT OF THESE CHOICES

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:12.339
EVEN THOUGH IT'S COMPLETELY

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:14.175
NOT. WHAT'S INTENDED FOR TRYING

01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:15.042
TO HELP BUT SOMETIMES THAT

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:16.977
HELPS. CAUSES HARM AND THAT'S

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:20.915
WHY WE NEED TO LEGISLATE- WE

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:22.850
ALSO KNOW THAT STATISTICS WE

01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:25.719
HAVE IS THAT 90% OF TIPS. WITH

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:28.622
CH ARE RECEIVING VAGINOPLASTY

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:29.890
SIR CLITORAL CLASSES. SO THAT

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:31.092
DOES NOT LIKE IT THAT YOU KNOW

01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:32.259
TO SAID THIS IS THIS IS JUST

01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:34.595
NOT HAPPENING IT'S NOT REAL IF

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:35.096
IT WEREN'T HAPPENING THE

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:36.063
QUESTION IS. WE WOULDN'T BE

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:38.265
HERE. OR WITH A WHITE AND SAID

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:40.334
LET'S JUST PUT IT INTO LAW. BUT

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:43.137
THE SURGERIES ARE HAPPENING A

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:45.039
AND THAT'S WHY- THIS IS ON.

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:48.976
SORRY THE SO COLLEAGUES- I

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:50.077

ADVOCATES TO REALLY DO AGAIN.

01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:01.021
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

VOTE. THANK YOU I SENATOR

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:04.291
WINNER- YOUR PASSION FOR THIS

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:05.860
ISSUE MAY EVEN EXCEED YOUR

01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:09.463
PASSION FOR SB FIFTY. EVEN AT

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:10.664
THE NATION'S ADVOCATE MORE THAN

01:36:10.731 --> 01:36:13.134
IT ADVOCATE- YOU CARE GREATLY

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.236
ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY- THAT YOU

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:16.871
ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS BILL WILL

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:19.006
HELP. AND ARE DESERVING OF

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:21.108
GREAT GREAT PRAISE FOR THAT-

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:23.978
AND I THINK THAT- IT'S CLEAR TO

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:25.779
ME THAT WE HAVE A LOTS OF AREAS

01:36:25.846 --> 01:36:29.016
OF AGREEMENT- I DON'T SUPPORT

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:32.887
SEX ASSIGNMENT- SURGERY- BUT I

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:35.156
ALSO HAVE TO BE. COGNIZANT OF

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:36.824
THE FACT THAT- THERE ARE A

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:39.727
NUMBER OF THOUGHT THAT THAT

01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:42.463
THAT CHILDREN. WHO HAVE HAD

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:43.864
PROCEDURES DONE THAT AREN'T

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:46.133
ABOUT SEX ASSIGNMENT- THAT

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.036
PARENTS AND PHYSICIANS IN THEIR

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:50.271
BEST JUDGEMENT AT THOUGHT WERE

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:53.574
TO THEIR BENEFIT. AND I DON'T

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:54.542
THINK THAT NECESSARILY

01:36:54.608 --> 01:36:56.844
ESTABLISHES- THEIR GENDER

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:59.380
IDENTITY I THINK IN SOME CASES.

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:02.783
IT COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.285
THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND THAT'S

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:07.555
NOT A GOOD THING- BUT I THINK

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:09.223
THAT I MIGHT MY CONCERN WITH

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:10.991
WITH YOUR BILL TODAY IS THAT I

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:12.459
THINK IT GOES IN AND THE RIGHT

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:13.894
DIRECTION AND SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:15.529
WAYS AND I AND I. AND IT'S

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.031
DIFFICULT TO SAY WELL THEN

01:37:17.097 --> 01:37:19.700
LET'S LET'S MOVE FORWARD AND-

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:21.535
BUT I DO THINK IT REQUIRES SOME

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:22.836
MORE WORK AND I DO THINK IT

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:24.705
REQUIRES SOME NARROWING- IN

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:27.141
REGARD TO THE DEFINITION- I

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:29.343
THINK WE CAN FIND A PATHWAY.

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:31.445
UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL IN ITS

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:32.680
CURRENT FORM IS NOT ONE I THINK

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:35.549
THAT WE CAN. STOP SIX

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:36.016
ASSIGNMENT SURGERY IN

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:37.618
CALIFORNIA I THINK WE CAN LEAD

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:39.253
THE NATION ON THIS IMPORTANT

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.256
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE AND- IT'S

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:43.924
WITH RELUCTANCE THAT I CAN'T

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:47.161
FIND MYSELF UNDER THE BILL AS

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:51.765
WRITTEN TODAY. URGING ITS

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:53.601
PASSAGE. AS SO WITH THAT CENTER

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:54.768
MAY MATTER OF A COUPLE

01:37:54.835 --> 01:37:55.970
COMMENTS. THANK YOU AND I HAVE

01:37:56.036 --> 01:37:56.604
TO TELL YOU SENATOR WINNER HOW

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:57.638
WOULD IT WHAT A PLESURE IT IS

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.006
TO WORK WITH YOU OF IT REALLY

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.108
IS BECAUSE YOU YOU ASKED US.

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:03.911
CONTINUOUSLY IN THIS BODY AND

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:06.947
IT IS- YOU KNOW WE SPENT A LOT

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.816
OF TIME ON THIS ISSUE WE'VE

01:38:08.882 --> 01:38:09.683
TALKED ABOUT IT A NUMBER OF

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:12.920
TIMES AND- YOU KNOW I THINK OF

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:14.188
THE PAIN THAT. THAT THE SIX

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:16.790
ASSIGNMENT. SURGERY HAS CAUSED

01:38:16.857 --> 01:38:18.225
IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TO CERTAIN

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:19.760
PEOPLE IN THE DIFFICULTY THAT

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:21.762
THEY HAVE AND- YOU KNOW ANYONE

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:22.963

GRANDPARENT. YOU KNOW I LOOK AT

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:26.600
THAT THOSE ISSUES AND  JUST

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:29.436
THINK THAT IT IT IS- SUCH A

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:30.037
CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCE BUT I

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:33.574
WAS. IS THIS IS EVOLVED IN MY

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:36.377
THINKING THE ISSUE OF. REALLY

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:37.978
DO NO HARM AND I KNOW THE

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.446
MEDICAL PROFESSION THAT IS THE

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:43.751
FOUNDATION OF FOR ME I IS I

01:38:43.817 --> 01:38:44.351
LOOKED AT THIS YOU KNOW I WAS.

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:49.123
LOOKING AT MY A. MY SENSE OF

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:50.424
THAT IN MY A FEELING OF I DON'T

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:52.593
WANT TO DO HARM. BY MAKING A

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.628
DECISION AND I LOOKED AT THE

01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:57.364
MEDICAL BOARD IN IN THEIR- ROLE

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.633
IN THIS. IN THE COMMITTEE THAT

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.535
WOULD BE ESTABLISHED AND I JUST

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:03.837
FIND. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:06.507
THAT AND IN THE SIX YEAR OLD

01:39:06.573 --> 01:39:10.244
THAT ARBITRARY NUMBER AGE. I

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:10.844
LOOK AT MY GRANDDAUGHTERS FIVE

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:11.879
ALMOST SIX AND I'M THINKING. I

01:39:11.945 --> 01:39:12.479
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:15.883
THAT. SHE COULD MAKE THAT

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:17.718
DECISION- ON INTO THE A NUMBER

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:21.488
OF. INVOLVED IN THIS IS THE

01:39:21.555 --> 01:39:22.556
CHAIR INDICATED I'M THERE. I

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:27.461
JUST. THERE IS JUST TOO MANY

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:28.062
UNCERTAIN FOR ME WERE I THINK

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.832
MY VOTE. COULD CAUSE HARM AT

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:34.868
SOME POINT IN TIME AND THAT'S

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:35.502
THE CHALLENGE FOR ME BUT I HOPE

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:39.873
YOU. IF THAT IN SOMETHING

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.575

PROUD TO BE SUPPORTING YOUR

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:51.719
BILL TODAY I'M SOMEONE I HAVE

01:39:51.785 --> 01:39:54.254
MULTIPLES- SCOLIOSIS THAT MEANS

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:55.756
THAT MY HAVE OCCURRED MY SPINE

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.292
BECAUSE MY LEFT LEG IS A LITTLE

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:00.394
BIT LONGER THAN MY RIGHT LEG I

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:01.562
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL

01:40:01.628 --> 01:40:03.697
I WAS MUCH OLDER AND CAME

01:40:03.764 --> 01:40:05.532
ACROSS IT WHEN I WAS DOING AT

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:07.034
PHYSICAL FOR TO GET ON THE

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:08.702
TRACK TEAM IN HIGH SCHOOL. I

01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:09.503
DON'T KNOW THE MY PARENTS EVEN

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.372
KNOW THAT I HAVE IT IT DOESN'T

01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:14.508
AFFECT MY DAILY LIFE I FORGET

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:16.276
THAT I EVEN HAVE IT UNTIL

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:18.278
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COMES UP

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.880
AND IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT IT

01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:23.117
AND I THINK- WITH ALL OF THEM

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:26.086
PEOPLE WHO. HAVE HAD SURGERIES

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:29.757
WHAT IT MEDICALLY NECESSARY AN

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:31.225
INMATE IN THE FUTURE PRETTY

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:33.394
EARLY FROM RURAL AREAS ARE

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:36.130
AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE

01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:38.432
SPECIALISTS THAT ARE AS

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:40.501
ADVANCED IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:42.703
WHICH AND LOCAL I RECALL

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:43.737
KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD WHERE

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.139
WOULD BE TAKE WOULD BE A. N.

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.273
DOT LIFE ALTERING CHANGES AND I

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.476
JUST THINK IT'S TIME TO. TO

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:51.145
STOP AND LOOK AT MAYBE THE HARM

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:53.614
THAT'S BEEN DONE AND HOW DO WE

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.516
HOW WE PUT A PAUSE ON THAT AND

01:40:55.582 --> 01:40:57.284
I TRUST THE MEDICAL FIELD

01:40:57.351 --> 01:41:02.222
ENOUGH THAT I BELIEVE IF THERE

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:06.927
WAS AN AGENCY THAT DIDN'T FIT

01:41:06.994 --> 01:41:13.033
WITHIN. THE CONFINES THIS BILL

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:14.968
THAT. WOULD BE IN A BILL STILL.

01:41:15.035 --> 01:41:22.609
THIS AT THAT THAT. MY PEOPLE

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:24.011
WITH THE INTENTIONS AT HEART

01:41:24.077 --> 01:41:25.312
SEE THAT THERE IS A NEED AND

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:26.780
THAT SURGERY COULD OCCUR

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:28.048
WITHOUT HAVING TO COME UNDER

01:41:28.115 --> 01:41:29.616
THE ANY PENALTIES UNDER THIS-BILL I DON'T THINK THAT THIS

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:30.884
BILL IS INTENDED TO GO AFTER

01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:32.886
DOCTORS AND PENALIZE BUT IT WAS

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:35.789
INTENDED TO SET THE RECORD

01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:37.891
STRAIGHT AND JUST TAKE THINGS

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:40.727
BACK AND SAY LET'S NOT LOOK AT

01:41:40.794 --> 01:41:44.465
LET'S NOT MUCH EMPHASIS ON

01:41:44.531 --> 01:41:47.267
WHAT'S NORMAL AND WHAT SOCIETY

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:50.237
THIS IS NORMALLY LIKE NO ONE

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:51.205
CAN SEE THAT I HAVE A CURVATURE

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:54.208
IN MY SPINE. IT DOESN'T MATTER

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:56.577
TO ME OR TO ANYBODY ELSE AND IF

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:58.846

CAN'T SEE UNLESS IT. KLAY

01:42:01.482 --> 01:42:02.015
NECESSARY IT SHOULDN'TMATTER

01:42:02.082 --> 01:42:03.050
AND I THINK I PUT TOO MUCH

01:42:03.116 --> 01:42:05.118
EMPHASIS AS A SOCIETY ON WHAT

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:07.588
IS NORMAL SO. I AM I AM PROUD

01:42:07.654 --> 01:42:08.889
