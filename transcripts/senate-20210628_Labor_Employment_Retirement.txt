ONE FIVE FIVE ZERO FIFTEEN FIFTY I'M A SOME READERS SO PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR RED. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY PROTECTS FACULTY BARGAINING RIGHTS BY ALLOWING FACULTY WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN A BARGAINING UNIT TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR UNION REPRESENTATION EVEN IF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. MOVES THOSE FACULTY POSITIONS TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. THREE YEARS AGO THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT REQUESTED THAT THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS MOVE SIX PART TIME NON SENATE FACULTY JOB CLASSIFICATIONS FOR LECTURERS INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. THE SIX PART TIME POSITIONS WERE ACTIVELY COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAIING AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MOVE BUT LOST THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION WHEN MOVED TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. THIS DECISION WAS CHALLENGED BY THE LABOR UNION THAT REPRESENTED THE PART TIME POSITIONS. HOWEVER THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD DECIDED THAT THOSE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS COULD NO LONGER BE UNION REPRESENTED POSITIONS BECAUSE OF RULES UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ACT. THOUGH THE CLASSIFICATIONS WERE VACANT AT THE TIME THE UC DECIDED TO MOVE THEM. IT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT COULD RESULT IN WORKERS LOSING THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION. FOR EXAMPLE THE UC COULD ALSO SEEK TO ELIMINATE AN ENTIRE BARGAINING UNIT BY MOVING ALL OF ITS CONSTITUENT FACULTY JOB TITLES. TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY PRESERVES EMPLOYEES RIGHTS BY ENSURING THAT KEEP THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO SEE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT JOHN RENDON C. U. C. A. S. T. OUR VICE PRESIDENT FOR LEGISLATION. AND MANUELA BOUCHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION BOTH ARE HERE IN PERSON TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL TURN TO JOHN RENDON FIRSTS- HERE IN PERSON ALL RIGHT YES YOU CAN HEAR IT ALL YES GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CORTESE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF AB FIFTEEN FIFTY. MY NAME IS JOHN RUNNIN I TEACH ANCIENT GREEK AND LATIN FOR A LIVING I'M A LECTURER UC DAVIS I AM PROUD OF WHEN A UNIVERSITY WIDE TEACHING AWARD. I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATION FOR YOU SEE IF T. WE'RE THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS THE LECTURERS AND LIBRARIANS ACROSS THE UC. THREE YEARS AGO THE UNIVERSITY MOVE SIX JOB TITLES THAT WERE REPRESENTED BY THE C. F. T. INTO THE SENATE AND EFFECTIVELY STRIPPED THOSE POSITIONS OF UNION REPRESENTATION. THAT WAS BECAUSE OF A LOOPHOLE IN HERO. IN FACT UNDER HERE IS CURRENT LANGUAGE THE UNIVERSITY COULD REMOVE UNION REPRESENTATION FROM ALL THOSE IN BARGAINING UNITS REPRESENTED BY THE UC AFT. MILLER BY MOVING THEIR JOB TITLES INTO THE SENATE. ALL THIS BILL DOES FIX A FLAW IN HERE IS LANGUAGE TO ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO ENGAGE IN UNION BUSTING TACTICS. THAT'S IT. WORKERS THAT HAVE A UNION SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR UNIT THE UC MOVES THEIR POSITION IN THE ECONOMIC SENSE. UC'S ARGUMENTS AGAINST BOTH THE BOB BILL ARE EITHER MISLEADING OR UNTRUE. FOR EXAMPLE THE NOTION THAT SENATE NOT SENATE MEMBERS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME MUNICIPAL UNFOUNDED. THERE WAS NO REASON THE SOME SUBSECTION THE SENATE SHOULD NOT BE UNIONIZED. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE DIFFERENT MORE BIFURCATED BARGAINING UNITS IN THE- ALSO THE FACT MEMBERS THE UC SANTA CONFIRM A NEW UNION UNDER EXISTING LAW DOES NOT MEAN IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE UC TO UNILATERALLY ELIMINATE UNION REPRESENTATION FOR WORKERS ALREADY IN A UNION. LASTLY THE BILL DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LIMIT UC'S ABILITY TO MOVE EXISTING POSITIONS IN THE ACADEMIC SENATE. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SIMPLY SIX TO ALLOW REPRESENTED JOB TITLES THAT ARE MOVING IT TO THE SENATE TO RETAIN THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION I URGE A YES VOTE NINE EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THANK YOU AND OF THE NEXT LEAD. US SUPPORT WITH THIS PLEASE. THE SOCIALIST IDENTIFY YOURSELF BEFORE YOU START THINKING. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MAN WHEN I WAS SAYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO BE HERE AS A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SIMPLY AIMS TO ENSURE THAT FACULTY MEMBERS AT THE UC RETAIN THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION REGARDLESS OF ANY UNILATERAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE UNIVERSITY THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY UNIONS HAVE BEEN PIVOTAL TO ENSURE SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND CONSISTENT DIALOGUE WITH MANAGEMENT. ANY SITUATION WHICH LEADS TO EMPLOYEES LOSS OF UNION REPRESENTATION ARE BARGAINING POWER SEVERELY IMPACT THE MEMBERS WELL BEING AND IS UNACCEPTABLE WITH EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY THE ISSUE IS SIMPLE FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE NO INPUT OVER THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE SHOULD NOT LOSE THE UNION REPRESENTATION. THEY HAVE PETITIONED FOR VOTED FOR AN ELECTED TO BE MEMBERS OF SOLELY BASED ON THE DECISIONS OF THE UC. EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY DOES NOT IMPACT THE UC'S ABILITY TO ELECT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE BUT MERELY ENSURES THAT ANY CLASSIFICATION MOVED INTO THE SENATE WILL RETAIN THEIR PREVIOUS REPRESENTATION THUS ENSURING THAT THESE FACULTY MEMBERS COVERED BY THEIR- REMAIN COVERED BY THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THEIR UNIONS. WE pURGE A YES VOTE ON EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT WHAT IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM- WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN FIFTEENTH SO PLEASE COME FORWARD THIS TO BE LIMITED TO NAME. AFFILIATION IN.

HI MISTER MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS MICHAEL THE DART ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ALL THE PRESIDENT- CAN I HAVE THAT TWO MINUTES OR SO TO. SPEAK OPPOSITION JUST. HER NAME AND ASIAN YOUR- WE GENERALLY DON'T DO THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT SEEN THAT THERE'S- NO OTHER OPPOSITION WITNESSES- IN A ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT- BUT WE WILL LIMIT TO TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU SIR- THIS BILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE ACADEMIC SENATE WHICH IS A CRITICAL PARTNER ENSURE GOVERNANCE MODEL MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. FANS ALSO UNNECESSARY SENATE MEMBERS CAN ALREADY UNIONIZED AND THE SENATE THE SPECIALTY ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING MEMBERS OF THE UC SANTA CRUZ ACADEMIC. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. THIS IS A PROUD UNION EMPLOYER AND DOES NOT ENGAGE IN UNION BUSTING TACTICS. BUT SENATE FACULTY AND NON FACULTY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND ROLES WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE AND UNIVERSITY ARE NOT OPPOSED TO ORGANIZED AND REPRESENTED MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMIC CENTER. WE ARE OPPOSED TO A BARGAINING UNIT THAT TRIES TO BLAND'S THE VERY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS INTEREST. AT THE CURRENT SENATE MEMBERS AND NON MEMBERS THE CURRENT LAW IS SUFFICIENT TO GRANT SENATE MEMBERS THEIR BARGAINING RIGHT. IN AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ON NECESSARILY CHANGES THAT IN A WAY THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE UNIVERSITY AND REDUCES THE VALUE OF THAT SHARED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THANK YOU. FLORIDA THANK YOU APPRECIATE RESPECTING. THE TIME LIMITS SOME- WILL COME NOW TO THE COMMITTEE. RIGHT SKEWS ME. WHEN WE COME BACK COULD TO THE COMMITTEE AND- SEE IF THERE ARE ANY CONCERNS COMMENTS THAT NEED TO BE EXPRESSED THE SCENE NOEL YES SIR YES MEMBERSHIP PLEASE PRESS THREE FOUR DAYS I DO HAVE A QUESTION- IT SAYS HERE. TURN TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE HERE BECAUSE AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON WHAT I'M READING HERE. THAT- UNDER EXISTING LAW I G. O. V. THIRTY FIVE SEVENTY NINE THE ACADEMICS AND IT ALREADY HAS A RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED BY UNIONS OTHER CHOICE SO HOW IS THIS BILL WHY IS THIS BILL NEEDED IF THEY HAVE THEY ALREADY HAVE A CHOICE- T. HAT BE REPRESENTED BY UNIONS OF THEIR CHOICE- BUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED. A FEW YEARS AGO AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS IS THAT. WHEN SOMETHING- FACULTY POSITIONS WERE MOVED INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. THEY WERE NO LONGER PART OF THEIR UNION SO WE'RE JUST MAKING SURE THAT IF SOMEONE. IS ALREADY. IN A UNION REPRESENTATIVE POSITION. THAT THEY ARE ABLE IF THEY CHOOSE TO STAY. SO THE. FROM THE UNION OF THEIR CHOICE THAT'S REFERRING TO YOUR DOES THAT NOT APPLY TO THE ONES THAT ARE CREAM THEY COULDN'T JOIN THAT PARTICULAR UNION. THEY THEY WEREN'T. THEY WOULDN'T STAY IN THE UNION THAT THEY WERE ALREADY REPRESENTED BY OKAY SO. FOLLOWING UP ON THAT IT SAYS THROUGH THE SHARED GOVERNANCE THE UC AS PARTICIPATES IN THE MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNIVERSITY- IT SAYS HERE- THEY HAVE CERTAIN MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS AS WERE A SUPERVISOR ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES- SAYS IT MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SENATE FACULTY TO BE IN A UNIT WITH NON SENATE MEMBERS IS THERE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN- IN IT BRING IN IN- THEIR PREVIOUS UNION INTO THIS PARTICULAR SPACE IS THAT THE CONCERN THAT WE THAT IT IS BEING EXPRESSED HERE. NO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING INAPPROPRIATE ABOUT HAVING THE ACADEMIC SENATE BE MIXED WITH UNION AND NONUNION MEMBERS IS THAT WHAT YOU MEANT THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTOOD I'M SORRY COMING IN WITH- BUT OUR VEHICLE THEY DO COME IN FROM ANOTHER UNIT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO REMAIN REPRESENTED BY THEIR UNION. I'M NOT AND YES YOUR AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ABOUT LOGIC AND IT CAN BE MIXED RIGHT BECAUSE- MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE. ARE NOT REPRESENTED NOT ALL REPRESENT THEY CAN BE. BUT WE HAVE THE OPTION TO BE A MEMBER OF THEIR OTHER REPRESENTS SCENTED UNION OF THEIR CHOICE RIGHT DID YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR- PREVIOUS ONE THAT THEY CAME OUT WITH A NEW ONE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AN OPTION FOR WELL IF THERE ARE. CLASS IF THERE ARE. OF MEMBERS THAT WERE IN PREVIOUSLY IN ANOTHER UNIT AND MOVED INTO AN ACADEMIC'S ACADEMIC SENATE WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE UC A FEW YEARS AGO. I'M NOT SURE OF MINE. ANSWERING YOUR QUOTE- MAYBE I'M NOT CLEAR ON WHATEVER QUESTIONS I COULD HAVE ONE OF MY A WITNESSES TRIED TO CLARIFY IF YOU'D LIKE. RUNS A POOR WIDOWS WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT THAT'S FINE. OKAY YES- I THINK CORRECTLY RIGHT THERE IS A- PRESENTLY A RULE WHERE HE'S NOW MICHAEL YOUNG WITH A CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WHAT THE TACKLE SPONSORS OF THE BILL- THREE YEARS AGO THERE WERE MEMBERS- THAT WERE REPRESENTED BY YOU SEE EIGHT C. THOSE POSITIONS WERE THEY MOVED INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THAT MOVE. THOSE SIX POSITIONS LOST DURING REPRESENTATION. YOU ARE RIGHT THAT- IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO JOIN A UNION AND THERE IS THAT ACTORS ACADEMICS IT IS PRESENTLY UNIONIZED. THAT'S NOT THE CONCERN THE ISSUE IS THAT ONCE THE UC AFT MEMBERS WERE MOVED INTO THE ACADEMIC CITY AND MOVED INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE THEY LOST DURING YOUR PRESENTATION THE RESTRICTED IT TO THEIR ONLY RECOURSE WOULD BE TO. CREATE A WHOLE NEW BARGAINING UNIT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO SAY THAT IF YOU'RE ALREADY REPRESENTED IF YOU HAVE A UNION YOUR JOB IS MOVED INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE YOU SHOULDN'T LOSE YOUR IN. YOUR PRESENTATION GET YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP IT. SO THE USE WOULD ARGUE OR INTO. TO SAY THAT. AKADEMI AND MEMBERS ARE HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNIONIZE WHICH IS TRUE. BUT THE ISSUE HERE IS WE- WORKERS THAT ALREADY HAVE UNION SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WORK OF. ORGANIZING AND CREATING A NEW UNION IMPLODING CREATING INTO BARGAINING CONTRACT THAT TAKES A WHOLE LOT OF WORK AND TIME AND EFFORT. THAT THESE WORKERS ALREADY DONE THEY HAVE UNION. SO THE HOPE IS THAT. IF THE UC DECIDES UNILATERALLY MOVE THOSE POSITIONS INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. THEY GET TO RETAIN BACKING REPRESENTATION. MAY AFTER. YOUR PERFORMANCE ISSUE THANK YOU. SO HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE HERE THAT- BY DOING SO BY FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THIS THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT- IT MAY- SEE WORRIED. AT C. IT'S AND I'M READING HERE A QUOTE AND I JUST WOULD LIKE YOUR TAKE ON THIS CONCERN WELL THE UC A. S. MAY UNIONIZE THEIR MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS AS WELL THE SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES MAY MAKE IT INAPPROPRIATE FOR SENATE FACULTY TO BE IN A UNIT WITH A NON SENATE MEMBERS AB FIFTEEN FIFTY WOULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO ACADEMIC SENATE FACULTY WHO MANAGE AND SUPERVISE INSTRUCTORS BEING REPRESENTATIVES SO I GUESS- THE IN A PROPER PART OF IT. IS MY CONCERN. YOUR TAKE ON NOT. HI I WOULD JUST FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH- THE OPPOSITION'S TAKE ONE DAY I THINK WE SEE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BIFURCATED INDEX PARKING UNITS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS THERE- CONNECTING WORK. DEGREE YOU NEED ABOUT THE UC THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR MAKE INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE- WORKERS IN A SIMILAR SITUATION- AND AGAIN I BELIEVE THIS WAS STATED BY- JOHN PREVIOUSLY- GAVE TESTIMONY IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE. A BIFURCATED MIX BARGAINING UNITS HERE THE SCOPE OF BARGAINING IS VERY CLEAR DELINEATED BY THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT- THE UC ALREADY HAS SORT OF REPRESENTED STATUS FOR SENATE MEMBERS. IN THIS CASE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. CREATING A NEW UNIT OR ANYTHING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WORKERS THAT ALREADY HAVE UNION SO IN THIS SITUATION THE UC ALREADY HAS A- A BARGAINING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORKERS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT SO. NOTHING NEW NEEDS TO BE CREATED WE CAN MAINTAIN THE SAME STATUS QUO WE'RE JUST HOPING THOSE WORKERS CAN MAINTAIN. THAT UNIQUE REPRESENTATION FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE RECORD THE WITNESS WAS JUST TEST FINANCING COURSES JOHN RENDON- SENATE LAYERED. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A BRIEF OBSERVATION AND THAT IS IT. BUT SOMEBODY THAT. REFERENCE TO DISTRICT AND WAS EVEN MAYOR OF A TOWN THAT HOSTS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUS. THERE OF OUR HEAD LABOR RELATIONS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT HAVE JUST BEEN FRAUGHT AND- IN MY OBSERVATION IS WHENEVER THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH AN ISSUE OR GOES ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME ON THE DRESSED. IT DROPS IN OUR LAPS AND I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. I'M AND THE A AND I HAVE SPOKEN SINCE HER- I'M THE CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE HAPPENS TO BE THE VICE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL. TO EXPRESS CONCERN TO THE NEW PRESIDENT OF YOU SEE. THAT HE TRIED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT IT SEEMS DYSFUNCTIONAL MANY WAYS WHETHER IT'S TO CONTRACTING OUT ISSUE THAT COMES AT US AND LOTS OF OTHERS. WAR WAR AGREEMENTS THAT EXPIRE GO ON FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT THE NEXT ONE BEING. NEGOTIATED AND SO I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. BUT I REALLY HOPE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ONE GAUGE. WITH ITS LABOR ORGANIZATIONS IN A FAIR MANNER THAT THEY CAN TRY TO RESOLVE THINGS AT THAT LEVEL AND THEY DON'T PUT US IN THIS MANNER. AND SO IF IT'S APPROPRIATE I WILL MOVE THE BILL. WELL LET ME PERCENT SURE THE TERROR. VIA CENTER NEWMAN. AB SURE I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT IN AND REINFORCE CENTER LAYERS COMMENTS HERE- AND TO THE WHICH JUST HAS TWENTY WHAT WHAT WHAT WE ARE ENDEAVORING TO DO. A IS TO PREVENT THE UC FROM UNION BUSTING BY MOVING POSITIONS CONVENIENTLY INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. SO AS TO REMOVE THOSE POSITIONS AND THOSE PEOPLE FROM THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION AND THEIR ROLE AS UNION LEADERS AND SO- THE TWO. JANUARY TWENTY TEN FORTUNE WE HAVE TO DO IT THIS WAY- BUT CLEARLY IT IS NECESSARY AND USEFUL I'M GLAD IT'S WITH THE BILL. THIRTY FIGURES FROM A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT CENA WILL GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. MADE FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. BERATE THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION HAS BEEN MADE BY SENATOR LAYERED WILL. GO TO THE CONSOLE AND ASK HER TO CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS COURTESY HI WHERE DOES THE I OR CHOI BOGUE. TO WRESTLE. THE REST OF I LAYERED. LATER AYE NEWMAN ALL RIGHT NEWMAN HI. WE HAVE A FOUR TWO ZERO ONE NOT VOTING FOR THE BILL ITSELF THANK YOU THANK YOU. FIRST WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK IN OTHER WAYS FOR JUNE THE IN THE ORIGINAL ORDER AT THIS POINT WE DID MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT- DUE TO A- LACK OF AUTHORS PRESENT EARLIER WITH ALL THE PROBLEM ANYMORE. SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A. B. SIX EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE- IN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU'RE WELCOME YOU AND TERRENCE SANDERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING AN AMENDMENT REQUESTING BY THE COMMITTEE TO CHANGE MENTIONS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES ALONG WITH THE APPROPRIATE CROSS REFERENCES. THANK YOU THANK YOU CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A GLOBAL LEADER IN COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE OUR STATE HAS LED THE WAY AN AGGRESSIVE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS WHILE pEXPANDING OUR ECONOMY TO BE THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH THIS HAS BEEN GREAT PROGRESS THERE IS MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT OUR INVESTMENTS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE ARE NOT GOING TO COMMUNITIES WHERE FUNDING IS MOST NEEDED. A JUNE TWENTY TWENTY REPORT AUTHORED BY THE STAFF FROM THE UCLA CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES FOUND THAT THE STRUCTURE OF OUR CLAIM INVESTMENTS IS SKEWED TO BENEFIT THE MOST AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES. IN OUR STATE. THIS HAS COME AT THE EXPENSE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ABILITY AND RESOURCES TO ACCESS EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SUCH INCENTIVES. BERMAN COMMITTEES ARE BEING LEFT BY THE WAYSIDE AS OUR STATE ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE. EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY HELPS BRIDGE THIS GAP BY IMPLEMENTING NEW KEY POLICIES RECOMMENDED IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S RECENT REPORT. PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON THE HIGH ROAD ADOPTING CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY. THIS BILL COMES TO YOU AFTER ENJOYING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT COMING UP THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY WOULD REQUIRE GIGI R. F. APPLICANTS TO USE FAIR AND RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER STANDARDS TO PROMOTE HIGH QUALITY JOBS INCLUSIVE. PROCUREMENT POLICIES TO MAKE SURE APPLICANTS ARE CONTRACTING WITH OTHER REASONABLE. RESPONSIBLE ENTITIES AND PREVAILING WAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THIS BILL WOULD FURTHER PRIORITIZE APPLICANTS THAT PARTNER WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET RESIDENTS UNDER RESOURCE TRIBAL AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN THE SAME REGION OUT OF THE PROJECT. THESE PROVISIONS WHICH ARE JUST A FEW OF THE RECOMMENDATION PROPOSED BY THE CW DB'S HI ROAD REPORT. BUT PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY ON THE FRONT END OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS RATHER THAN AN AFTERTHOUGHT THROUGH THE SET ASIDES WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN PLACE. I RESPECTFULLY QUESTION I BUILT ON A. B. SIX EIGHTY TO MAKE SURE THE COMMUNITIES WHICH NEED THESE CLIENT INVESTMENTS ARE MOST ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND. THANK YOU FOR THE REMAINDER CENTERS NEW IDENTIFIED LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS ON THIS BILL- HERE TO TESTIFY AS JEREMY SMITH FROM CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING TRADES. OKAY WELCOME- YOU MAY COULDN'T PROCEED ON.

UP GOOD AFTERNOON PLEASE PROCEED EXTRAMARKS DIVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AND WE RESPECT WITH RESPECT WE MUST OPPOSE AB SIX EIGHTY UNLESS AMENDED. WE ALL SUPPORT STRONG LABOR STANDARDS FOR STATE PROGRAMS BUT IF THIS IS CENTER CORTESE SAID AND SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE THE OTHER DAY. THERE ARE TIMES IN THIS MAKES SENSE AND TIMES WHEN IT DOESN'T. FOR TO THE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THE BILLS JUST DON'T MAKE SENSE- IT MOVE FORWARD WILL HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. RECEIVE REDUCTION FUND REVENUES AND ALREADY SERVES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- OFTEN IN INLAND AREAS WHERE WE JUST DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A UNION WORK FORCE. US TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STUDY BY THE STATE BUILDING TRADES MENTIONED THAT WE NEED TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE OUR STATE CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE TO MEET OUR FOR WILL HAVE A MEET HOUSING NEEDS GENERALLY. AND I'VE HEARD ESTIMATES IS ONLY ABOUT 20% OF THE YOU CAN. CURRENT CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE IS UNION. SO I PROJECT AND HAVE A THEY AGREEMENT THE CANNOT A UNION. WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROCEED AT ANY PRICE. AND IN PLACES WHERE WITH MORE OF A UNION PRESENCE WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GET THREE COMPETITIVE BIDS. FOR HEATING CONTRACTORS IN WHICH CASE THE CONTRACTORS WILL HAVE MARKET POWER. TO SET ANY PRICE. LIKE FLIES WITH THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM- THAT BRING SOLAR AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE WORK IS GENERALLY DONE AS PART OF A MAJOR OVERHAUL OF THE REDEVELOPMENT A WRITTEN A REHABILITATION DOESN'T WORK. AND IF ANYONE SOURCE TRIGGERS PREVAILING WAGE THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF WORK MUST BE PREVAILING WAGE. WHICH RAISES COSTS ON AVERAGE 13% STATEWIDE BUT IN THIS CASE HOUSING PROVIDER SIMPLY WILL PASS ON THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM FUNDS AS IT WOULD ADD MORE COST TO THE PROJECT AND THEY WOULD FOR RECEIVING THE AMOUNT OF THE GRANT. BEING A NET NEGATIVE. CALIFORNIA WILL LOSE THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND SUBJECT RESIDENTS TO HIGHER UTILITY BILLS AS A AS A RESULT. SO WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED AMENDMENT TO EXEMPT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM.

BUT WE'LL GO TO LINE OF ONE SIXTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS RICHARD MARCUSSEN FOR THE PLUMBING HEATING COOLING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU YOUR MODERATOR OF COMPACT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS CENTER DRAWS OF. A YESI WOULD- MOVE THE BILL WHEN OF WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE MISTER CHAIR AND ALSO WANT TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR- I THINK THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT CONNECTION TO MAKE BETWEEN. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS ESPECIALLY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE CHANGING THE WORD DISADVANTAGED UNDER RESOURCE. IT'S NOT LIKE COMMUNITIES ARE BORN DISADVANTAGED IS BECAUSE A DELIBERATE DECISION IS MADE. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO UNDER RESOURCE NOT PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHAT CREATES A DISADVANTAGE IT'S NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND- I THINK THE- THE PART OF BEING UNDER RESOURCE IS NOT HAVING ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THAT BECAUSE WE CANNOT DO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL DUTIES- AND CREATE LOW PAYING JOBS AND THEN THAT CREATES A DEMAND FOR MORE AFFORDABLE LOW INCOME HOUSING THEN THAT. I MEAN IT'S JUST A TERRIBLE VICIOUS CYCLE SO I THINK- THIS IS THIS IS THE DIRECTION OF HIGHROAD PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I KNOW IN THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AGENCIES AND GROUPS- WE REALLY NEED GOOD PAYING JOBS PERIOD AND I. AGAIN I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT AND I THANK THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR OF ANYONE ELSE AT THIS TIME BUT YES MADAM BUTCHER. SO M. FOR THE RECORD- AND DISCUSS TO ANY MY COMMITTEES YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO GIVE ME FEEDBACK ON THIS PART BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY STATE FUNDED A PROJECT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ANY STATE PROJECT. TWENTY OF IT ANY C. PROJECT IS ALREADY UNDER. THE PURVIEW THAT THEY HAVE TO BE THE EMPLOYEES HAVE TO BE PAID- PREVAILING WAGE. ON ANY ANY. I MEAN IT FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ANYTHING THAT HAS STATE FUNDING. MUST BE OUR EMPLOYEES MUST BE PAID- PREVAILING WAGE- I'M GOING TO IDEA IS GOING TO COME UP AND ANSWER THEM FOR YOU SO THAT YOU HAVE A 100% CONCRETE ANSWER HOW HOWEVER CLEARLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE BECAUSE WE START TO SIGN. BUTTON YES THIS GERRY SMITH ROBERT HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL YES THAT IS CORRECT SNATOR. ANY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT- THE ESTATE FUNDING OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS DOES HAVE TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE. OKAY SO WITH THAT IN MIND- AIDS CONTINUES WE SEE THIS- OPPOSITION TO BRITAIN'S STATUTE- WHAT I CALL THEM. IN MY PERSONAL OPINION- DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES WERE NOT EVERYONE HAS THE ABILITY TO BID. ON THESE PROJECTS- GIVEN THE FACT AND WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE A PREVAILING WAGE JOBS BUT- IT IS MANDATORY IT'S AN STATURE REDDING CALIFORNIA THAT ANYBODY THAT BIDS OR PROVIDES OR OR OR- BASED ON THESE PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE YOU JOBS ON STATE. FUNDED PROJECTS ARE PREVAILING WAGE SO I HAVE A CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IN THE SENSE THAT WE DON'T HAVE- WE'RE LIMITING. YOU CAN BID FOR THESE JOBS NOT NECESSARILY- WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PAYING PREVAILING WAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO- BUT MY CONCERN WOULD BE IN AREAS WHERE. LABOR IS- LIMITED- YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF. OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIFFERENT COMPANIES TO COME IN BED SO THAT THAT THAT MAKES THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES I CAN BID ON PROJECTS TO A SMALLER NUMBER WHICH MEANS THAT THE COST OF. DOING THAT PROJECT NOT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT BE FEELING PREVAILING WAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DO THAT BUT THE COST. OF THE PROFIT MARGIN WOULD BE HIGHER. SO THE PUT THE PRICES WOULD BE MUCH MUCH HIGHER FOR THESE PROJECTS. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THE PRIME WHY WOULD THE PROJECT BE MORE EXPENSIVE IN YOUR PURVIEW BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE LESS PEOPLE BIDDING ON THE PROJECTS SO. BECAUSE THERE'S LESS PEOPLE BE ABLE TO BID ON THESE PROJECTS IT COULD FACILITATE THAT PROFIT MARGIN TO GO HIGHER- BUT IF YOU OPEN IT TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE. ON THE ROCK SHE WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF BEATING PROCESS ON IT TONIGHT I GUESS MY CONFUSION IS THAT WHY WOULDN'T ANY OF THEM BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE BUILDING TRADES WHY WOULD ANY OF THEM NOT BE ALLOWED TO WORK WITH BUILDING TRADES. NO I'M GOING TO PUT PRINT ON MY GOAL IS. MY INTENT IS TO EMPHASIZE THAT I WOULD LOVE FOR IT TO BE OPEN TO EVERYONE NOT JUST PARTICULARLY- IT IS OPEN TO EVERYONE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S ANYONE THAT CANNOT BE IT WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT THEY IT SHOULD BE THROUGH AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND- HAVE WORKED WITH THE- WITH. AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT ANYONE CAN BID ANYONE CAN WORK WITH THE BUILDING TRADES AS A MATTER OF FACT IN MY WORK ON THIS BILL TALKING TO THE OPPOSITION. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY SAY THAT THERE'S AREAS WHERE THERE'S LACK OF WORKERS. IT IS ACTUALLY THE JOB OF THE BUILDING TRADES TO WORK WITH THESE COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY BUILD THAT DROP FORGED IN ANY AREAS THAT THAT THAT. THERE AREN'T THE AMPLE AMOUNT OF WORKERS AND TO GET FROM THERE. SO THIS DOES LIMIT WHO CAN BID. AND NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S A WAY TO LOOK AT IT IF YOU WANT TO. BUT THE REALITY IS IT DOESN'T LET LIMIT WHO THERE'S NO LIMITATIONS TO WHO CAN WORK WITH THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. OKAY SO ANYONE FROM ANY APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM CAN ACTUALLY WORK ON THESE PROJECTS. YES I GUESS CENTER THERE ARE UNION AND NONUNION STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND ONE OF THE BEAUTIES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE PREVAILING WAGE OTHER THAN- PAYING LIVING WAGES A MIDDLE CLASS BENEFITS- IT FIXES THE COST OF LABOR. EVERYBODY'S GETTING ON THE SAME PROJECT UNDER THE SAME RULES SO THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME LABOR COSTS WHETHER THEIR UNION OR NONUNION. OKAY PERFECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY ANY ANYTHING ALSO FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. A CITY NINE- LET ME JUST SEE TO THE OUTER BEFORE HE CLOSER TO APPRECIATE. YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND ON THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THE CONCERN YOU FROM AGREED TO ADDRESS WITH YOU UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- I WON'T REPEAT MUCH OF WHAT SENATOR CROSSIN SAID BUT- I KNOW THERE WAS CONCERNED EARLY ON THE NOTICE WITH THIS BILL BUT IN GENERAL AT TIMES- WILL USE WRONG INDEX OR INDICATOR OR- BUT ONE THAT WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED REACHED THE OUTCOMES THAT WE LIKE TO SEE- THESE ISSUES COME UP SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION AGAIN IN.

THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRED THE CHAIR IN THE- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK ON ON THIS BILL WE APPRECIATED AND WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT NEW VERNACULAR. AND SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I WOULD HAVE TO REITERATE THAT WHEN WE SPEAKING ABOUT WITH THE OPPOSITION WE DID DO A LOT OF WORK WITH THEM AND ALSO THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISBELIEF. WHY WOULD WE BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NOT PAY PEOPLE A PROPER WAGE AND GIVE THEM THE PROPER BENEFITS THAT THEY REALLY DO DESERVE. AND GIVE THEM THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE NOT JUST. NOT JUST TO TAP REAL CAREERS TO HAVE REAL OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S DAY FUNDS REALLY SHOULD GO TO WITH THAT I SIMPLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SOMEWHERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION- AS MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF. MEDINA STATED WE ARE AT THE SPONSORS OF AB TWO SEVENTY FIVE. EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE IS A CLEAN A BILL THAT PROVIDES PARITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN NON MERIT DISTRICT. AND YOU MIGHT HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION AND THEY MIGHT SAY THAT SIX MONTHS IS INSUFFICIENT TIME TO FULLY EVALUATE AN EMPLOYEE- BUT WE DISAGREE. IF SIX MONTHS IS-SUFFICIENT IN K. TWELVE IS SIX MONTHS IS SUFFICIENT IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEERUT DISTRICT NOW WHY IS IT INSUFFICIENT AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOT MERIT DISTRICT- WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS SUB GROUP THAT- DOES NOT MERIT THE SIX MONTHS- PROBATION PERIOD AS WELL. BESIDES OUR POLICE CLASSIFICATION- IN WHICH WE TOOK A MAN MADE. A TO ADDRESS AND DATE MEET D. E. ARE GOVERNED BY THE COMMISSION ON A PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING OR POST REGULATIONS- BUT ALL OF OUR OTHER CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES HAPPY SIX MONTH PROBATION PERIOD- THE OTHER. OF THE- THE OTHER ARGUMENT YOU. MAKE HERE IS THAT. SHE SHOULD BE COLLECT FAR. BUT WE ARE RIGHT KNOW THAT PROBATION IS COVER BASED- AGAIN ALL OF OUR OTHER CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES GET SIX MONTHS AND SO WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS SUBGROUP I SHOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT- THE ONLY REASON WHY. THEY HAVEN'T OR THEY DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY IS BECAUSE WE INADVERTENTLY LEFT HIM OUT OF. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY THREE TWO YEARS AGO SO TODAY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE TO CORRECT THIS OVERSIGHT AND PROVIDE PARITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IN DOT MATRIX THANK YOU.

THERE IS NO SOUND PUBLIC POLICY REASONS REQUIRE THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES AND NON MERIT COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS BE SUBJECTED TO A PROBATIONARY PERIOD DOUBLE OF THAT OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN MERRICK COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. AND DOUBLE THAT OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN NON MERIT K. TO TWELVE DISTRICT. REALLY NO EMPLOYMENT REASON EITHER THE SIX MONTHS OF PLENTY OF TIME TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE MEET THE STANDARDS REQUIRED OF THE POSITION. IN FACT IT SIX MONTHS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME THE PROBLEM REALLY LIES WITH THE EMPLOYERS PROBATIONARY STRUCTURE AND TRAINING PROTOCOLS NOT THE PROBATIONARY CANDOR THAT. FURTHER WILL NOT TAKE THE MISSPELLED IMPOSES OVERLY BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS ON THE AFFECTED EMPLOYERS THE EXISTING TWELVE MONTH PROBATIONARY PERIOD IT IS OVERLY BURDENSOME AND UNFAIR TO PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES WHO MUST NEEDLESSLY WAIT AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS.

TO AB THREE SIXTY FOUR ALSO SOME REMEMBER RODRIGUEZ PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS WHO COME TO CALIFORNIA TO WORK RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTIONS FROM WELL DOCUMENTED DECEITFUL PRACTICES OF THIRD PARTY FOREIGN LABOR RECRUITERS. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR CORRECT A DRAFTING ERROR MADE IN S. B. FOUR SEVEN SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT CREATED THE FIRST FRAMEWORK FOR COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTIONS FOR TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS. AMONG ALL TYPES OF VISAS H. TWO A. VISA PROGRAM IS A TEMPORARY VISA CATEGORY LINK TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES IN THE UNITED STATES. NEWLY RELEASED DATA FROM THE NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE DURING THE PANDEMIC SHOWS THAT AGRICULTURE WORKERS WITH H. TWO A. VISA REPORTED 70% MORE CASES OF TRAFFICKING AND EXPLOITATION. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE WORKERS ALSO REPORTED BEING DENIED MEDICAL ATTENTION AMONG OTHER ABUSES WHILE THEY WERE DEEMED ESSENTIAL BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR MAKING THE POINT DISTINCTION THAT THIS BILL IS NOT DUPLICATIVE. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT EMPLOYERS WHO CONTRACT FOR THEIR OWN H. TWO A. WORKERS WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT. TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL WE ARE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS BOTH FEDERALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THESE AFFORDABLE TEMPORARY MIGRANT WORKERS ENTERING CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE SERVICES. OF FOREIGN LABOR RECRUITERS. THIS BILLS INCREASE PROTECTION WOULD DO JUST THAT I HAVE COME ALIVE WITH ME TODAY ON THE LINE TO STEPHANIE RICHARD REPRESENTING THE COALITION ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING AND- SPEAK TO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. ALSO COMING IN AS A VICTIM OF FOREIGN LABOR GROUP APPROACHES THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS. PLEASE JOIN ME AND PROTECTING THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO LEGALLY. ENTER CALIFORNIA TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES SHOULD BE SAFE PERSPECTIVE TRAVEL. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL PUT THE STUFF IN THE- RICHARD AND STEPHANIE IS ON THE TELECONFERENCE ON- IF YOU'RE THERE YOU CAN PROCEED. YES MY NAME IS STEPHANIE RICHARD I'M CAPTAIN LEVINE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING CAST CASHIER BONTA OF AB THREE SIX FOUR WE'RE ALSO THE LARGEST LEGAL AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER FOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS IN THE UNITED STATES. AFTER SERVICE PROVIDERS EXPERIENCES WORKING WITH TRAFFICKING VICTIMS WE LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT TRAFFICKING BEFORE IT STARTS. IT'S ELIMINATE THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICE OF THE THIRD PARTY FOR LABOR CONTRACTORS AT THE TIME OF WORKER RECRUITMENT. THE SHADOW AGENTS FORCED WORKERS INTO DEBT BY CHARGING THEM EXORBITANT FEES FOR LEGAL WORK VISAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SB FORTY SEVEN SEVEN WITH AFTER REMEDY THIS PROBLEM. AB THREE SIX FOUR IS NECESSARY FOR THE SAME REASON SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN WAS ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. DOCUMENTED GRAVE AND WIDESPREAD ABUSE OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING TRAFFICKING OF THE DIFFICULT CRIME TO PREVENT BUT TODAY WE CAN PROTECT THE VULNERABLE WORKERS. MANY OF WHOM ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS OF THE HARDEST HIT BY THE BANK AND DEMOCRATS AND IT'S CONTINUING NEGATIVE IMPACTS. SB FORTY SEVEN SEVENS REQUIREMENT AS CLARIFIED BY AB THREE FIX FOR OUR SPECIAL FOR PROTECTING ALL TEMPORARY WORKERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. SOMEONE BEAT AROUND EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR FOCUSES ON EACH TO A AGRICULTURAL WORKERS THAT'S ONLY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND WORKERS. WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF ALL THE OTHER VISA CATEGORIES THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT ABUSES SUFFERED BY WORKERS RECRUITED BY FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS ARE THE SAME REGARDLESS OF THE CATEGORY FOR THAT REASON THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR GOAL WAY BEYOND THOSE EXISTING CALIFORNIA FEDERAL LAW. THEY PROVIDE A SORELY NEEDED CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK COVERING ALL THESE TWO CATEGORIES ONE THAT MESHES WELL BUT DOES NOT OVERLAP WITH EXISTING PROTECTIONS THE BILL PROVISIONS ARE ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS. EMPLOYERS WILL NOW NOT HAVE TO WILL NOW HAVE A DREADED WITH THE LEGITIMATE RECRUITERS IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO DIRECTLY RECRUIT THEIR OWN TEMPORARY WORKERS. AND THE UNFAIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESSES USING RECRUITERS WHO UNDERPAY WORKERS WILL BE A LIMITED THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS DOUBLE LICENSING OR BURDENSOME IS LIKE SAYING THAT IF YOU HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A MOTORCYCLE. LICENSE THE BUSINESS GAUGES AND DIFFERENT ACTIVITY BASED. HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE FOR OVERSIGHT REGULARLY. ADDITIONAL IT'S MORE DISTURBING THE AGRIC. IN THESE ONLY. OPPOSITION TO THESE NEW A PART. FOR ALL WORK. AS THE AUTHOR SPOKE ABOUT. EVERY REPORT SHOWED THE H. TWO A. CAL. IS THE HIGH. AREA OF EXPLOITATION AND THAT JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT BY THE NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING- CENTER GAVE US THAT GRANT. SUGGESTING THAT SOMEBODY MORE CASES OF TRAFFICKING EXPLOITATION 70% OR MORE CASES OF TRAFFICKING EXPLOITATION WERE REPORTING DURING THAT A PANDEMIC. FOR THOSE REASONS I AM A SURVIVOR CAL. REPRESENTS YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB THREE SIX FOUR I'LL NOW TURN OVER TO ANGELA GUNSAN WHO IS A HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVOR. OF FORCED LABOR AND YOU CAME. HERE ON A TEMPORARY WORK VISA. I THINK YOU STEPHANIE GOOD AFTERNOON OUT MEANING CENTER GLENN'S I AM UNABLE TRACKING. ORIGINALLY FROM THE PHILIPPINES. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HEARD ME SPEAK IN SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN- THE NASAL CANALIS IN FRONT OF THE LAST NAME BUT I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER HOW EXCITED I WATCHED BECAUSE I THOUGHT THIS DEAL WOULD HAVE REALLY HELPED ME AND WOULD PROTECT MANY OTHER IMMIGRANT WORKERS STRIKE ME. I WAS DEVASTATED WHEN I HEARD THAT THE BILL WOULD ONLY COVER EACH TO BE WORKERS. BECAUSE OF THE DRAFTING ERROR. I DIDN'T COME TO THE UNITED STATES ON AN H. TWO B. VISA I CAME ON A P. ONE VISA. AND HE WAS BECAUSE OF HOW CONFUSING DIVISA PRACTICE WISE THAT I ENDED UP TRAFFIC. COMING TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE LOVE OF THE CELL WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD JOB. IN THE PHILIPPINES LIKE WINNING THE LOTTERY WHEN I GOT MY VISA I WAS EXCITED. THAT THEY DIDN'T ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS I CAME TO THE CALIFORNIA WITH ANY POLLUTER. BUT MORE THAN TEN OTHER PEOPLE ON P. ONE VISAS WHO BELIEVE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO LEGALLY WORK IN THE UNITED STATES. WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES MY PASSPORT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME. I WASN'T GIVEN A CONTRACT- OR TERMS OF MY EMPLOYMENT BEFORE I LEFT MY HOME COUNTRY. I WAS TOLD THEY OWE TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MY TRANSPORTATION. TO THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE STAFF. I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD HAVE TO WORK ANY. AT A TIME AND HOME FOR THE L. THE GATE IN LAS. TO BE OFF THAT. I WORKED EIGHTEEN HOUR A DAY RECOUNT OFF. AT THIS REPORT THE FLOOR IN THE HALLWAY. AND EIGHT DEMOCRATS TRAFFICKER ALWAYS JACKSON THAT. SHE TOLD ME IF THE POLICE ON ME. THEY COULD TAKE US AWAY AND PRODUCTION JAM. IT'S GOING ON FOR YEARS I AM NOW WORKING FULL TIME AS A MEDICAL BILLER AND SENATE VOICES CONSTANTLY. AT ONE THE TYPE OF ABUSE THAT HAPPENED TO ME AND MY COWORKERS HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND OF OTHER SURVIVORS IN MY NETWORK. SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN SHOULD COVER MORE TEMPORARY VISA CATEGORIES THAT EACH TO BE NO TEMPORARY WORK VISA CATEGORIES SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THE REGULATIONS TO PROTECT WORKERS ESPECIALLY NOW WE DISCARDED NINETEENTH AND GRAMMY I BELIEVE MANY PEOPLE NOT ONLY FROM THE PHILIPPINES BUT ALSO FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WILL TAKE ANY CHANCES. SAID THEY NEED EXTRA PROTECTION. NO ONE SHOULD BE THEY HAVE TO WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER NINE AND DATE. AND BE FOR THE POINT I'M FREE FOR THEIR OWN. AND THE FACT. AFTER GETTING A READING OF THE STAR. ALL MIGRANT WORKERS SHOULD BE. SO WE HAVE INFORMATION HOME COUNTRY ABOUT WHAT DIGNITARIES. ARE GOOD AND FAIR. NOW PREVENTED ME FROM BEING TRAFFICKED. I HOPE YOU BOTH I AB THREE SIXTY FOUR THANK YOU.

AWAY OF FUTURE PROGRAM WAS NOT OVERLOOKED DURING THE DISCUSSION AND- PASSAGE OF THAT BEFORE SEVEN SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THE CHOICES- ALREADY COVERED BY A VERY RICH FULLY REGULATED AND RESTRICTIVE APPLICATION PROCESS THE FEDERAL LEVEL. DANTICAT'S FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CALIFORNIA'S VERY AESTHETIC AND UNIQUE TIME LABOR CONTRACTOR REGULATION THAT IS MANAGED AND OF COURSE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR COMMISSIONER'S.

THE CONTINUING EDUCATION PRESS ALSO USES SEEK RENEWAL OF THEIR LICENCES. AB THREE SIXTY FOUR SEEK TO CHANGE EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH CREATED THE FLC REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.

THESE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN HIGHER EDUCATION GET THE SKILLS NECESSARY FOR LICENSURE AND ARE NOT AFFORDED BASIC RIGHTS REGARDING DISCIPLINE OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SOMETHING MINOR THAT'S UNRELATED TO A CLINICAL PRACTICE OR ACADEMICS.

NINE DEFINITIONS ON A LINE WITH THE LATEST- EVIDENCE BASED- GOT GUIDANCE FROM CDC OR C. PH- CREATING A CONFLICTING SET OF RULES FOR HOW TO BEST PROTECT PATIENTS WORKERS.

OFFERING NEARLY FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD TIME. AND ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES. OF THE CURRENT SITUATION AS WE LOOK AT.

A VAST MAJORITY OF THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS THAT I HAVE WORKED WITH ENTERED INTO THE WORLD OF EXPLOITATION AS CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND FIFTEEN YEARS. THEY ARE DISCARDED LIKE TRASH WHEN THEY'RE LUCRATIVENESS AND APPEAL DIMINISH BY THEIR MID TO LATE TWENTIES. MANY DO NOT POSSESS HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS AS THEY WERE PREYED UPON WHEN IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. SURVIVORS POSSESS LIFE EXPERIENCES IN THE UNDERBELLY OF THE EXPLOITATION INDUSTRY THAT MANY OF US CANNOT GRASP. A SURVIVOR ONCE SAID TO ME I APPRECIATE YOUR BACKPACK OF FOOD AND TOILETRIES BUT WHAT I REALLY NEED IS A JOB. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WILL PROVIDE HOPE FOR SURVIVORS AND THE REALIZATION THAT THEY ARE VALUABLE. THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGAIN THE POWER OF THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIVES. MANY OF THE SURVIVORS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ASSISTING HAVE EXPRESSED THEY WANT TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP OTHERS.

AND WE HAVE NO COMMENTS COMING THROUGH AT THIS TIME OKAY WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND- CHECK WITH OUR- COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO BE RECOGNIZED ON THE DAIS- CENTERED ROSAL YES OUR QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR YES- WHO WOULD YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU THANK YOU- IT IF YOU COULD ON A PRACTICAL BASIS EXPLAINED- HOW UNDER EXISTING LAW. THE STATE AGENCIES- WHEN HIRING FOR THE SAME POSITIONS INTERNSHIPS AND STUDENT ASSISTANT POSITIONS. CURRENTLY ARE REQUIRED TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO PRISONS. YOUTH UP TO SIXTY. TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE OF ALL WHO HAVE BEEN DEPENDENT CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE HOMELESS YOUTH OR FORMALLY INCARCERATED YOUTH. NOW WITH THIS BILL WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SINCE IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME- LANGUAGE TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOW HOW. HOW COULD THAT WORK HOW DOES SOMEONE. DO THAT AS AN EMPLOYER DO YOU MIND SENATOR IF I COULD NOT TURN TURNED TO DO WELL GOMES. WHO TESTIFIED FIRST TO THAT WOULD BE FINEYES THE BRIDGE WILL GOMEZ- THE QUESTION HAS BEEN TENDERED TO YOU- MY PLEASURE TRY AND RESPOND TO THAT AND- SO I WOULD SAY THAT- BASED ON. THE LANGUAGE IN AB TEN THIRTY ONE CLEARLY HIGHLIGHTING THE CRITICALLY. SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHERE THEY BELIEVE IN THEIR CURRENT THE CURRENT BILL LANGUAGE IT DOESN'T NOT LIKE YOU TO POINT IT OUT A. B. AFTER YEARS- AT ANY AGE- REQUIREMENT BUT- THIS REALLY SPELLED OUT THE NEED FOR SURVIVORS WHO ARE OFTEN CRIMINALIZED. AND NOT NECESSARILY CONSIDERED AN OFTEN PASSED OVER FOR INTERNSHIP- INCIDENT THAT THAT PROGRESSION. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. RESEARCHER YES ROSA YOUR THE FORGERS IT REALLY DOESN'T I'M I'M TRYING TO GET AT. WHERE THERE IS A CURRENT PREFERENCE LIST. OF YOUTH FOSTER CARE HOMELESS FORMALLY INCARCERATED WE HAVE THE SAME WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME LANGUAGE NOW BEING- APPLIED TO VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ALL YOU CAN DO ALL OF THAT. OKAY AS AN EMPLOYER IS- LET ME KNOW IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I CAN GO TO THE DA'S OFFICE RIGHT MISSILES I'M SURE SHE WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER. YES THANK YOU. WHAT WE SEE SO- FOR SEVERAL OF THE VICTIMS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH IT IS THE LACK OF EDUCATIONAL- EXPERIENCE AT THE HOUSE BECAUSE MANY OF THEM AS WE SAID HAVE BEEN. PULLED INTO THE TRAFFICKING LIFE- WHEN THEY WERE JUVENILES AND SO IF THEY'VE REACHED ADULTHOOD A LOT OF THEM ARE STILL PURSUING ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING YOUR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY ALTHOUGH THEY MAY HAVE- SOME FELONY CONVICTIONS WHAT WE ALSO SEE IS SOME OF THEM HAVE EXTREME DIFFICULTIES IN TRYING TO CLEAR UP THOSE MATTERS. BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND SELL OUR% ORGANIZATION THROUGH THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS WILL HELP THEM- CLEAN UP THOSE RECORDS. BUT WE DO FIND THAT SOMETIMES THAT THE BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAFFICKED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WILL HAVE- CRIMINAL RECORDS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND THAT COULD BE A HINDRANCE FOR THEM THAT PERHAPS. FOSTER USE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE DEALING WITH. WHEN SEEKING EMPLOYMENT. MISTER CHAIR THE SERVER I'M THINKING HE SAID THE THAT DIDN'T ADDRESS THE QUESTION AND IF YOU LOOK AT. IT EDUCATION WE PRIORITIZE A FOR FUNDING AND- OF FOSTER KIDS HOMELESS KIDS SPECIAL NEEDS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ONE OTHER IF YOU LOOK AT OUR SENIOR SERVICES WE- WE CATEGORIZE CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAT WE CAN DO WE PRIORITIZE AND I THINK WHAT THE SENATOR WAS ASKING IS HOW DOES THIS MATCH. OR THEIR CATEGORIES THAT ARE ALREADY PRIORITIZED ANOTHER WEST MENDOZA SAID TO IT- I THINK THE CASE WAS MADE FOR WHY THIS PARTICULAR CATEGORY FITS BUT THE QUESTION WAS IS ARE THERE OTHER CATEGORIES MISTER SIS ONE THAT'S ADDED TO THE LIST. SAID AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT I THINK THAT'S SORT OF WHAT THE SENATOR WAS TRYING TO GET ADVERSELY SETS WHAT I INTERPRETED MANY TO SAY. THAT SENATOR DRAWS A I MEAN THIS. DOES THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT BARRIERS. SPECIALLY FOLKS THAT ARE IN THIS CATEGORY. THAT THEY JUST WON'T BE HIRED YOU KNOW FOR AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE. I MEAN IT'S A DOMINO EFFECT RIGHT YOU GOT- HOMELESS YOUR FIRST SET. IT DON'T HAVE HOUSING- WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADD ANOTHER CATEGORY SO THAT WE CAN HELP IN THE SYSTEM PUT PEOPLE BACK TO EMPLOYMENT IT'S- WHAT- MISTER MISS GOMEZ SAID IT'S ABOUT HOPE IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP AT THE END AND WE'RE HOPING THAT WE COULD DO. BETTER THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. DESERT ROSE OKAY I. AM I TOTALLY SUPPORT. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS NO DOUBT THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. AND I WILL. SUPPORT THIS- BILL TODAY BUT I I'M STILL. YOU KNOW LEFT WITH THE ISSUE OF IF YOU ARE A STATE AGENCY. HOW DO YOU TAKE FEYERICK THESE FIVE CATEGORIES. AND GIVE PREFERENCE TO EACH ONE OF THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD GUIDANCES THERE SO MAYBE OFFLINE YOU CAN FURTHER ANSWER MY ROOMMATE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE TO THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU REMEMBER SURE. I THINK- I ACTUALLY HAD THE SAME CONCERN AND QUESTIONS CENTER DRAWS SO HAS IT WHICH IN MY- IN MY UNDERSTANDING I THINK THE QUESTION IS. HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE ALL OF THESE GROUPS WE HAVE ALL THAT EQUAL FOR IT ILLEGAL LEVEL SO WE HAVE. SPOROCYSTS YOU APPLY ANY CHECK THE MARKS IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THIS CATEGORY THIS CATEGORY WHEN MAKING THAT DECISION HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE- AT WHAT LEVEL DO YOU PRIORITIZE- THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES TO AVOID THIS THIS PARTICULAR ONE FALL IN IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER. CATEGORIES THAT YOU HAVE TO PRIORITIZE I THINK THAT IS THAT WAS MY QUESTION AS A WOULD YOU FALL INTO THAT LINE OF CATEGORIZING AND PRIORITIZING. THIS PARTICULAR GROUP WITH IN THE OTHER GROUPS THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE AN IN CONSIDERATION AND- A PREFERENCE OUR PRIORITIZATION POINT- DECIDING ON THESE POSITIONS. AND I KNOW WE'RE YOU'RE HEADING WITH IS AND I. TOTALLY AGREE AND BE WILLING TO WORK WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE. I GUESS MY POINT IS THIS IS THAT WORK WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE- ARE PUSHED. TO QUALIFY THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT SET ASIDE THEY'RE NOT PUSHED AWAY. YOU KNOW WE WANT THEM WE WANT AGENCIES. TO ACCEPT AND WORK. TO TRY TO HELP HELP MOST OF THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE OUR PLANE NOW THAT REALLY PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE. A CHANCE OF HOPE DEAR DIDN'T MMHM MOST PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIM AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THEY MADE THEMSELVES MAY THINK THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A SHOT. AND I'M REALLY TRYING TO PUSH THAT THEY DO WE WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE MORE. THE PROJECT EXECUTE. THIS SUMMER I'M SORRY I JUST FEEL OBLIGATED TO MAKE A COMMENT AFTER THAT BECAUSE- THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES HERE. AND ONE IS ONE OF THE PROCESS DO YOU USE FOR DEALING WITH THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN MAKING SURE THEY ALL GET A SHOT. THE SECOND ISSUE IS MAKING THE CASE FOR THIS ONE PARTICULAR CATEGORY. AND I THINK WHENEVER WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM. OF HOW YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE FIVE WE GET A PITCH FOR THE ONE CATEGORY. AND I THINK I AGREE WITH SENATOR DRAWS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ONE CATEGORY WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR WHAT THE PROCESSES FOR. FOR HOW YOU DO IT AND I THINK I JOIN SENATOR ALSO INSIDE. VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL BUT THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO HAVE ADDRESSED GOING FORWARD AND- IT'LL JUST BE. WE ARE JOKING BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE HALF THE BILLS WE VOTE ON HERE COME TO JUDICIARY AND THEN WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN.
