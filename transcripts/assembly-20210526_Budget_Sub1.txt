I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO READ SOME DIRECTIONS REGARDING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S HEARING TO HELP INSURE THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE HERE TODAY WHILE ALLOWING FULL PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE DISCUSSION. WE ARE ACCEPTING PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THIS HEARING BOTH IN THE HEARING ROOM AND ON THE PHONE. THE PHONE NUMBER TO CONNECT IS ON THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE AND SHOULD BE ON THE SCREEN IF YOU ARE WATCHING OVER THE INTERNET. THE NUMBER IS. ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN. TODAY WE ARE ACTING ON MANY OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET AND MAY REVISE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROPOSALS NOT ALL ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS WILL BE ACTED ON TODAY AS SOME ARE STILL UNDER DISCUSSION AND WILL BE HELD OPEN AND VOTED ON IN FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK. MEMBER AND STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACTED ON IN TODAY'S HEARING BUT INSTEAD WILL BE MAY BE ACTED ON DURING NEXT WEDNESDAY'S FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING. CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATE AND THE ADMINISTRATION ARE ONGOING AS ALWAYS AND WE CONTINUE TO WELCOME PUBLIC INPUT ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET. BEFORE WE START I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR ALL THE HARD WORK. THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO GET US HERE. WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE RESOURCES BUT MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS NOT HIT US ALL EQUALLY. WE MUST LOOK FOR WAYS WITHIN SOME WANT TO SUPPORT OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE BUDGET THAT MAKES HEALTH CARE ACCESSIBLE TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE ONE THAT PROVIDES EMERGENCY FOOD AND ADDRESSES GROWING HUNGER. ONE THAT ADDRESSES THE UNDER FUNDING AND OUR DEVELOPMENTAL. SERVICES SYSTEM AND ONE THAT TAKES BOLD ACTION TO NOT ONLY DISRUPT BUT TO BREAK DOWN SYSTEMIC RACISM BAKED INTO THE STATE'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. THIS BUDGET WILL CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS THAT FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND THAT MOVE US UPSTREAM TO PROACTIVELY FACE MANY OF THE COMPLEX AND VEXING PROBLEMS IN OUR STATE. I AM GRATEFUL TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THIS BUDGET FORWARD. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AS WE HELP TO DELIVER A BUDGET THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. A BUDGET THAT STANDS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THE ALL HERE IS IMPORTANT AS THE HEALTH OF EACH OF US IS DEPENDENT ON THE HEALTH OF ALL OF US. DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION WE SAW GOVERNMENT STEP IN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE AND WHO FELL THROUGH THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET. BY INVESTING IN ALL AMERICANS THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY WE CAME OUT STRONGER AND BETTER THAN BEFORE. NOW IS THE TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO THE SAME BY STEPPING UP LEADING AND INVESTING IN ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN THIS PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY WE SAW DISPARITIES BEAR OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND WE MUST USE THIS MOMENT AS AN ACCELERATED FOR CHANGE SO THAT ALL OF US CAN RISE OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC STRONGER THAN EVER. WE MUST SUPPORT AND RESOURCE OUR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY R. L. INTELLECTUALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO ADDRESS THE HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES. AS WE LOOK TO STRENGTHEN OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET WE SHOULD LOOK TOWARDS PROGRAMS THAT INVEST IN EQUITY PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND CONTINUE OUR STATE'S MOVEMENT TOWARDS HEALTH FOR ALL.

IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO TRANSFORM AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEMS FOR THE BETTER AND IT IS AN HONOR TO BE A PART OF THE PROCESS AS WE WILL MOVE CAL AIM AND THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. IN ADDITION TO THE INSPIRING LEADERSHIP PUT FORWARD BY THIS ADMINISTRATION. MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN MAKE GREAT STRIDES THIS YEAR AND ALL OF THE FOLLOWING. FIRST HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE NOT JUST ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BUT ALSO ON SKILLED NURSING CARE AND HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE DIVERSITY. SECOND INCREASING AVAILABILITY TO HEALTH SERVICES BY PROVIDING EVERY POSSIBLE METHOD OF ACCESSING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HI E. TELEHEALTH WHICH WAS PROVEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. TO IMPROVE EQUITY AND ACCESS. THIRD KEY PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTMENTS INCLUDING ENDING THE EPIDEMICS OF HIV SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND HEPATITIS ALE LESS CARE REDUCING DISPARITIES IN CHILDREN'S MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND OF COURSE INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL. FOURTH ON YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THE GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVE PROVIDES AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A WORLD CLASS ONE OF A KIND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR KIDS. CALIFORNIA MUST ALSO ACT NOW WITH GREAT URGENCY TO ENSURE THAT KIDS HAVE THE SUPPORTS THEY NEED THIS YEAR IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION BACK TO SCHOOL AND RECOVER FROM THE TRAUMA OF THIS PANDEMIC. THERE ARE MANY INVESTMENTS UNDER CONSIDERATION AND HUMAN SERVICES INCLUDING THOSE THAT SUPPORT CHILDREN SERVED IN OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE AND DEEP TRAUMA. WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO ADDITIONALLY SUPPORT OUR SENIORS PERSONS SERVED IN OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM AND OUR IMMIGRANT BROTHERS AND SISTERS. FINALLY WE WANT TO MODERNIZE OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM THAT SERVES OUR POOREST FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN LIVING BELOW 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE KNOWN AS DEEP POVERTY. WE WANT TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM MORE EMPATHETIC AND HELPFUL AT THIS TIME OF GREAT ECONOMIC STRUGGLE FOR SO MANY. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT IT AND EVERY SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAM IS OPTIMALLY PREPARED TO HELP ALLEVIATE POVERTY AND GIVE EVERY PERSON BASIC SUPPORTS AND ULTIMATELY AN OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY WHICH IS SO INGRAINED AND CAST ALONG RACIAL LINES IN OUR STATE. THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THIS PROGRAM AND I AM COMMITTED TO GETTING US THERE. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR INDULGENCE AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE COUNTLESS HOURS THE LONG HEARINGS AND FOR ALLOWING OUR COMMITTEE TO BE WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE HEARD. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE PUBLIC FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION TO MAKE THIS BUDGET REFLECT ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR PRIORITIES. AND TO TRULY MAKE THIS THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE.

WE WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- JUST WANTED TO ITEMS AND I KNOW I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD TO MY COLLEAGUES BUT- AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS IS JUST ABSOLUTELY. COMPLETELY BAFFLES ME IS WHEN WE REQUEST RATE STUDY TO BE COMPLETED FOR THE IDT POPULATION. AND IT DOES GET COMPLETED AT A COST OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN IT COMES OUT THREE YEARS AGO. AND WE STILL HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED. DID WE WANT TO RAISE STUDY DID WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT OUR DEFICIENCIES WERE TO SUPPORT THIS PROP- POPULATION- YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE IN A BUDGET SURPLUS AND WE'VE MADE THESE PROMISES EURO AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR TO THIS POPULATION. AND THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT AND YEAH YEAH IS A QUOTE FROM YOU IS THIS ALIGNMENT STATE OR WHAT. DO WE ACTUALLY FOLLOW. WALK THE WALK AND TALK THE TALK FOR THESE FOLKS- AND AGAIN I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS. IF NOT HILL BY YOU A BUDGET BABY BILL AND IN AUGUST TO A KNOWLEDGE OF. THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEEDS TO STOP AND HAPPEN NARAL OF THESE FOLKS ARE A PRIORITY THERE PRIORITY TO ALL OF US. SECOND ONE IS I WAS JUST MADE AWARE YESTERDAY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE NOTICE THE STATE HOSPITALS HAS MADE MY COUNTY. AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY- SUBJECT TO. OF RECEIVING UP TO TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MENTAL PATIENTS THROUGH THE CALENDAR. AND THEY'RE GONNA STOP OF SUPPLYING THE MONEY TO KAISER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. BY TONY IS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS. THIS IS REMINISCENT OF THE REAGAN ERA. THIS IS ALMOST WHAT WE DID TO THE DISABLED- ID POPULATION WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. WERE WERE GETTING RID OF SERVICES AND WERE A- KNOWLEDGE AND MAKING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. A TAKE ON A LOOK OF GOOD THAT DID WITH THE EIGHTIES WITH MENTAL HEALTH OF THE HOMELESS. CRISIS WE HAVE NOW UNDERGOING EXACERBATE THAT IN THESE TWO COUNTIES WHICH ARE ALREADY. GONE SO I'M HOPING THROUGH THE CHAIR AND THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS CALLIN ISSUE WITH. A SLOW CARRY SACRAMENTO COUNTY- BECAUSE AGAIN- YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT A CRISIS THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS FOLLOWED BY SOME REMEMBER. GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE MISTER FRAZIER- WITH IT WITH THE- YOUR LAST POINT I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST THOSE TWO COUNTIES I THINK WE DEFINITELY NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT STATE WIDE- TO ENSURE WE DON'T HAVE THAT TRAVESTY AGAIN. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ECHO THE POINTS- FOR RDT COMMUNITY- AS MR FRAZIER ALREADY SAID BUT- YEAH WE DIDN'T. VOTE ON THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW IT WASN'T ON OUR AGENDA TODAY AND WE ALL KNOW IT'S A HIGH PRIORITY. SO TO GOING DEEPER I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MONEY THAT THE TWENTY NINETEEN. PROVIDER RATE STUDY SHOWS IS NEEDED. IN TWENTY NINETEEN DDS ISSUED A STUDY THAT ESTIMATED SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE. UNDERFUNDED BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION EVERY YEAR THE CAN TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER FREIGHTERS POINT WE ARE IN A HUGE BUDGET SURPLUS. THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET THEN PROVIDED LESS THAN 25% OF THE AT AMOUNT. NOW THE GAP IS AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THE GENERAL FUND. ONE POINT FOUR BILLION WITH FEDERAL FUNDS THAT IS THE AMOUNT NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES A QUALITY SERVICES IN PLACE TO HELP THEM LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW. THE MAY REVISION HAS NO PROPOSAL TO FUND THE RATE IT'S THAT THE STUDY SHOWS ARE NEEDED. THE GOVERNOR'S TALK ABOUT HOW HIS HISTORIC THIS BUDGET IS AS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT IN THE OPENING. HOWEVER WHAT WOULD. BE TRULY HISTORIC. IS IF WE FINALLY STOPPED SHORT CHANGING SERVICES TOWARD THE COMMUNITY. I'M SURE THAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE SHARE MY CONCERNS SUCH AS MY DEAR COLLEAGUE MISTER FRAZIER. THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT WE ALL WANT TO HELP. RELEASED WE SAY WE WANT TO HELP. I'D BE PREPARED TO VOTE TODAY THE FUN THE ENTIRE RATE STUDY. BUT I'M HOPING WE CAN FIND IN AGREEMENT WITH ALL MEMBERS SO I HOPE WE CAN KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THEN APPROVED THE RATE INCREASES NEXT WEEK AT OUR FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING MR FRAZIER I DO RESPECT THE POINT ABOUT A TRAILER BILL FOR AUGUST BUT I THINK. IS DIRE IS THIS ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT WE ALL HAVE ALL BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS ON IT WE PUSH TO GET THE STUDY WE GOT THE STUDY WE KNOW WHAT THE STUDY SAYS. IT AGAIN TO QUOTE GERMAN ARAMBULA ARE WE ALIGNMENT STATE OR NOT MEMBERS. I REST MY CASE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS ONE- SAY SOME BRIEF COMMENTS AND ALL COMMENTS LEADING UP TO- THE NEXT MEETING WITH A FULL BUDGET- COMMITTEE CERTAINLY SEEN- THE MENTAL HEALTH AND THE YOUTH COMPONENT BEING PART OF WHAT THE MINISTRATION WITH HIS BODY DISCUSSES IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S OVER DUE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR YOUTH I HAVE THE MENTAL RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AND PUTTING THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER THAT WE WOULD INCLUDE. THE EDUCATION- ARENA AS WELL AS PARENTS AND OTHERS THAT ARE THERE THAT ARE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE WITH OUR YOUTH THAT COULD BE SUFFERING ARE ARE SUFFERING. WITH GREAT NEEDS SOME FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE AND ALSO JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO PUSH ON THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE FUNDING FOR THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE WE HEARD IT- DISCUSS WITH MANY PANELISTS THAT CAME UP BEFORE THIS- THIS BODY THAT TALKED ABOUT IT AN AREA WHERE ALL THESE RESOURCES CAN BE FUNNELED TO SO THEN WE'RE NOT PULLING FROM DIFFERENT AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THERE IS A- AN AREA. THAT WE CAN GET ALL THESE RESOURCES TO IMPORT FROM THAT DATA AND I BELIEVE THAT THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION IS ESTABLISHED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- THE FUNDING COMPONENT OF IT WE TALKED ABOUT HERE- IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEN THE MERITS OF THAT BUT I WOULD ALSO- CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND WITH MY COLLEAGUES AS WE GO INTO THE NEXT DISCUSSION WITH A FULL BUDGET- COMMITTEE ITSELF. SO IT'S- SOMETHING THIS IS DRASTICALLY NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND THE RESOURCES ARE THERE BECAUSE NOW MORE THAN EVER WE'RE SEEING THE IMPACT NOT ONLY JUST ON THE WHOLE POPULATION BUT SEVERELY ON OUR YOUTH POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOMEONE THANK YOU FOR. ALLOWING US TO BRING THOSE ISSUES UP AND FOR THE SOMEBODY TO TAKE THOSE- INTO CONSIDERATION AND MOVING. FORWARD WITH THE ADVOCACY OF THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I REALLY APPRECIATE- THE CONVERSATION AND I WON'T- BELIEVER THE POINT BECAUSE I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN- AND AN AGREEMENT THIS WHOLE ENTIRE TIME ABOUT WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE AND BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT- YOU KNOW WHERE I AN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES THAT'S OUR FAVORITE WORD- AND WE HAVE MONEY THAT- WAS NOT- PROJECTED.

WHEN WE WENT TO OUR OUR BUDGET CRISIS THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE NOT A LOT OF THEM HAVE NOT BE REINSTATED BEEN REINSTATED WE CANNOT SAY IT'S EXTRA MONEY UNTIL WE AKE ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS HOLE- IT'S A- REWARDING TO BE HERE BUT IT'S ALSO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE KEEP FIGHTING OVER THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO YOU ARE OPEN ONE THIRTY- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CONNIE ARNOLD AND- I'M A DISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATE FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS AND I AM OPPOSED TO THE LIFTING OF THE TRAILER BILL TRAYLOR LANGUAGE ON ETV ON GPS TRACKING. AND I'M ACTUALLYVERY DISAPPOINTED IN IN- THE BUDGET ITEMS THIS YEAR BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL THAT WHEN IT COMES TO I. HSS THERE'S BEEN AN INSUFFICIENT. NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR PERSONS ON AYE HSS AYE CHIP AYE HSS RECIPIENTS- AND I THINK YOU NEED TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK. AT THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS. AND THE IDEA OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY WAS NOT NECESSARILY AS A CAREER PATH AS I AGES THAT PROVIDERS TO GO INTO HOME HEALTH. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE MODEL OF THE- THE MEDICAL MODEL FOR- I AGES THAT HAPPENED ACROSS THE STATE- REALLY I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT I AGES THAT. AND H. C. B. S. H. C. B. S. WE NEED TO BE. DEVOLVED FROM A MEDICAL MODEL EVEN THOUGH I AGES THAT FOLLOWED THE SOCIAL MODEL WILL BE WE SEEM TO BE GOING ALONG THE WAY OF. CAREER PATH FOR AGES THAT PROVIDERS TO MOVE UP THE LADDER TO HOME HEALTH BUT WE NEED LONG TERM WORKERS WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK FOR US IN THE COMMUNITY. SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE ADDRESSING THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE ISSUE- AS STATED IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY. GOING WITHOUT CARE AND NOT GETTING THEIR MEAT NEEDS MET AS ELL AS NOT HAVING- COMPETENT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NON RELATIVE PROVIDERS PROVIDING THE CARE- COMING THROUGH THE DOOR FOR INTERVIEWS. AND PART OF THAT IS THE PROVIDER WAGES THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIFFERENTIAL IN PAY FOR PROVIDERS- WHO WORKS FOR THOSE WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES WHO DON'T HAVE A RELATIVE PROVIDER AND DON'T HAVE- YEAH AND ACTUALLY HAVE MULTIPLE PROVIDERS. OF ONE OR MORE WHERE AT LEAST ONE IS A NON RELATIVE PROVIDER ME PROVIDER. AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER ISSUES IN THIS BUDGET THAT WERE NOT- GOING IN THE DIRECTION I THINK WHERE WE NEED TO GO FOR DISABILITY CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE INDEPENDENT LIVING MOVEMENT ALTHOUGH I KNOW THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS AND THERE ARE SOME GOOD PROGRAMS OUT THERE ASKING FOR FUNDING.
