SEVENTY SEVENTY THREE THE WILLIAMSON ACT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE TO PRESERVE OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVE AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR YEARS THE STATE FUNDED THE ACT AT AROUND THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY MILLION TO ALLOW CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIPS WITH LANDOWNERS TO OFFER PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVES IN EXCHANGE FOR RESTRICTED USE OF THE LAND. ALTHOUGH THIS FUNDING CEASED DURING THE RECESSION THE BILL BEFORE YOU AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY THREE SEEKS TO REINSTATE THIS FUNDING BY ALLOCATING FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE WILLIAMSON ACT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUBVENTION PAYMENTS. THESE PAYMENTS HAVE ALLOWED FOR THE PROTECTION OF SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES OR NEARLY ONE THIRD OF PRIVATELY OWNED LAND IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE IT HAS NOT BEEN REENACTED MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCEPT NEW CONTRACTS. FOR LAND CONSERVATION ADDITIONALLY SOME COUNTIES HAVE ISSUED NON RENEWAL NOTICES TO LANDOWNERS THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN A CONTRACT THIS MEANS LANDS THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE CONSERVE OUR AT RISK FOR DEVELOPMENT. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY THREE WILL BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS BY KEEPING LAND WORKING AND VALUABLE SPACE OPEN FOR AGRICULTURE AND WILDLIFE THAT DEPEND UPON IT. HI HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TAYLOR RUSSIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AND CATHERINE FREEMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. I THINK IS ON THE NUMBER THAT YOU GUYS WOULD LIKE TO. HOW DOES ONE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND ALSO FOR THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN SEVENTY THREE AND THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR CARRYING THE BILL. AS YOU HEARD THE WILLIAMSON ACT IS A STATE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM. OTHER PRESERVES AGRICULTURE AND OPEN SPACE THROUGH PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVES PRIVATE LANDOWNERS IN EXCHANGE FOR A LOWER PRIVATE PROPERTY TAXES ENTERED INTO ROLLING TEN AND TWENTY YEAR CONTRACT. COMMITMENTS WITH PARTICIPATING COUNTIES- TO KEEP THEIR LAND IN AGRICULTURAL A COMPATIBLE LAND USE. THE WILLIAMSON ACT IS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IT'S PRESERVED OVER SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES OF AGRICULTURE AND WORKING LANDS. THE TAX RELIEF THAT THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE EVEN MORE ENTICING BENEFITS TO KEEPING. WE WORKING OPEN SPACE AND CONTINUE AS A SPACE FOR WILDLIFE AND AGRICULTURE THAT DEPEND ON THEM AND THEN THEY COUNTIES AND TOWNS THAT DEPEND ON THESE AGRICULTURAL AREAS. MORE THAN EVER- OPEN SPACES NEEDED FOR MULTIPLE BENEFITS WATER FARMING RANGELAND FOOD SUPPLY. WILLIAMS AND I WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE COUNTY IS IN EXCHANGE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE A PROGRAM. WITH THE GOAL OF FARMING AND LAND PRESERVATION OR TO RECEIVE A PARTIAL REPLACEMENT OF WORK ON PROPERTY TAX AND THESE TAXES WERE JUST USE FOR AGRICULTURE THERE WERE USED FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THE FOREGOING PROPERTY TAXES COULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY SCHOOLS AND OTHERS. SIX A MENTIONS WERE ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA'S RURAL COUNTIES FEW DISCRETIONARY REVENUE SOURCES AND THEIR LOSS TODAY. UNTIL IT WAS ELIMINATED IN THE TWENTY EIGHT TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TEN STATE BUDGET. WILLIAM SNACK FUNDING. RANGED FROM AS YOU HEARD THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND AS WE MOVE INTO ANOTHER UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET SURPLUS YEAR. THE SUBVENTIONS ARE EVEN MORE THAN IMPORTANT THAN EVER. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT REVIVING STATE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM IS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO PRESERVE. AGRICULTURAL AND OPEN SPACE LANDS AND RESTORE COUNTY SPENDING THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- TAYLOR RUSSIAN WITH A CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY THREE FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT WERE SEATED BUT I WANTED TO OFFER. A LITTLE BIT MORE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE WHEN ONE'S NECK WAS PASSED IT WAS. BASED SOLELY ON OPEN SPACE AND ACKLIN PRESERVATION AND THAT ACTUALLY HAS ITS VALUES AND WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED OF KEEP KEEPING FARMERS FARMING. I THINK THE CHALLENGE SINCE THE LOSS OF SUBVENTIONS HAS BEEN ABOUT ARTICULATING. THE BENEFITS OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY PROGRAM IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CONTEXT- SO WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WILLIAMS NOT CONTRACTED LAND HIT ALL THE MARKERS THAT ARE PRIORITIES FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION. HOPEFULLY FOR THIS LEGISLATURE AND FOR THE PUBLIC- ANY ADDITIONAL DECREASE COSTS FOR FARMERS THE ON KEEPING FARMERS FARMING. ALLOW THEM TO REINVEST IN THOSE PRIORITIES AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THINGS LIKE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WITH DUST MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. ARE PROTECTING AND ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY THROUGH HABITAT RESTORATION FOR JOB OPPORTUNITIES AUTHORIZING PUBLIC ACCESS ON THE WINGS NOT CONTRACTED LAND SO WE CAN HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO NATURE- ENHANCED IN ORGANIZED LAND USE. FACILITATING CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION ON FARM- ANNE'S COMPATIBLE USES THAT ARE BENEFICIAL FOR THE STATE LIKE RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION. SO WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT COUNTIES CONTINUE TO INVEST AND ALLOW FOR AND LANDS TO BE UNDER CONTRACT. AND SUBVENTIONS DO MATTER JUST YESTERDAY IMPERIAL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HEARD A MOTION TO TRY AND- OPEN UP. ACREAGE FOR WINGS NOT CONTRACTS AND WAS DENIED BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT WITHOUT THE SUBVENTION PAYMENTS ARE OFFERED SO. WE DO- VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE INTENTION OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY THREE AND HOPE. THAT WE HEAR AND I WOULD SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT TEST. WE DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES ON FILE IN OPPOSITION.

THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT EQUIPMENT EXCELLENT CHEMICALS- EXCELLENT COMPANY SORRY SPECIALIZED IN THAT BUT IT'S STILL IN ITS INFANCY AND THAT'S- I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE SOME MAJOR CHANGES IN WATER USE EFFICIENCY.

THE ISSUES FACING FARMERS ARE UNIQUE PRODUCE IS GROWN FURTHER INLAND AND HAS A SHELF LIFE AND SO WHEN THERE ARE SHIPPING DELAYS FARMERS CANNOT RECOVER LOST PRODUCE. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION MADE UP OF EXPERTS IN THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON CHANGES THAT NEED TO OCCUR TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. OF POOR CONGESTION HAS HAD ON AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. CONVENING A PANEL OF EXPERTS WILL HELP LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL POLICYMAKERS IMPLEMENT NECESSARY FORMS.

AND WITH THAT WE HAVE- TWO WITNESSES OFFERING TESTIMONY- THE FIRST IS A STELLAR OCEAN WITH- THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU AND WE HAVE SHOULD ATTACH CHEF SENT ON OF THE S. THE DIRECTOR OF CULINARY OPERATIONS AND INNOVATION AT THE UC- DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER- SO. THANK YOU FOR READING- I LIKE TO THINK MANY FOR THE UP TO TESTIFY MY NAME IS SANTANA DHEAS- DIRECTOR CORNER OPERATIONS AND INNOVATION AND EXECUTIVE CHEF- FOR A FOOD NUTRITION SERVICES AT UC DAVIS HEALTH. HOWEVER I'M HERE AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN AND MY TESTIMONY DOES NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- SO OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS- WITHIN HAVE THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY HAVE HELPED INTRODUCE A TRUE. CALIFORNIA FOCUSED FOOD PROCUREMENT PROGRAM MAKING UC DAVIS HEALTH. FOOD NUTRITION SERVICES AND NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED LEADER FOR SUSTAINABLE FOOD WITHIN HEALTH CARE PER PRACTICE GREEN HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE WITH HIGHER HEALTH CARE WITHOUT HARM GUIDELINES. THIS TRANSITION COMES FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH LARGE SCALE FOOD OPERATIONS SUCH AS HOTELS AND OPENING UP SPORTS VENUES LIKE LEVI STADIUM GOLDEN ONE CENTER. THAT THE TIME IS NOW FOR PATIENTS TO RECEIVE QUALITY HEALTHY AND NUTRITIOUS FOODS THAT ARE SOURCED FROM THE BOUNTY OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES REGIONS OF THE STATE. OPERA THE CITY. UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK- THE CAME OUT- AND MARCH THIRTIETH WITH THE REPORT THAT SAID TITLED HOW FOOD AND DIET IMPACT THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE. THEY FOUND THAT QUOTE THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING THE IMPACT OF FOOD AND DIET ON HEALTH. SPECIFICALLY AMONG FOOD RELATED DISEASES WHILE DIET HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE DISEASE IT ALSO. IS CAPABLE OF BUILDING MAINTAINING AND RESTORING HEALTH WILL BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE AND USE THE FOOD AS MEDICINE FOCUSING ON PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE ALL WHILE SUPPORTING A CALIFORNIA FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THIS WOULD ALLOW AN INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAM LIKE THE HOSPITAL WHERE I RESIDE TO REMOVE UNNECESSARY ADDITIVES AND PRESERVATIVES FROM MENUS WHILE USING NUTRITION AS A GUIDELINE OF VALUES TO PROMOTE CLEAN AND HEALTHY FOOD FOR OUR PATIENTS. THIS IS NOT A NEW PRACTICE IT IS TIME TO INCREASE THE ADOPTION WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS CAN INFLUENCE PURCHASING PRACTICES BY CREATING THE DEMAND FOR AGRICULTURE AND KEEP FARMS A FLOAT AN EXAMPLE THIS EFFORT WOULD BE HOW THE UC DAVIS HEALTH. FOOD SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO AVOID. MANY OF THE NATIONAL FOOD SYSTEM SHOCKS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN WOES BY SOURCING MANY OF THE FOODS OF THE PROGRAM FROM WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS ALSO YOU'LL THIS STRONG RESILIENCY FOR A COMMUNITY WITHIN REACH WITH RESPECT TO JOBS AND HAVING A MULTITUDE OF POSITIVE RIPPLE EFFECTS. THIS% PILOT WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION TO HELP BUILD THESE FOOD PROGRAMS INTO EVERYDAY OPERATIONS HOSPITALS HAVE THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH YOUNG PATIENTS WITHIN PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS AND EDUCATE THE YOUTH. USING FOOD AS MEDICINE HOSPITAL SHOULD ACT AS A TEACHING FACILITY USING FOOD AS A CORE COMPONENT COMPONENT OF HEALTH AND AB TWENTY FIVE OR- TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. WILL HELP US. M. GET THAT MUCH CLOSER.

AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO BE REPLICATED OVER MULTIPLE LARGER SCALE INSTITUTIONS AND HOPEFULLY THE STATE TO MAKE SOME- INVESTED PROCUREMENT IN CALIFORNIA GROUND- THIS CAN CREATE AND ENHANCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FARMERS THAT DEAL WITH INCREDIBLY HIGH PRODUCTION COSTS LOST MARKETS FROM CODED. OR CURRENT PORT ISSUE THESE HEARD MR FONG SPEAK ON AN INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION LIMITED RESOURCES- OR HOPEFULLY NEW AND BEGINNING FARMERS AND RANCHERS THEY CAN FIND NEW MARKETS AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL PURCHASERS- ALL THIS IN TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX BIDDING PROCESS THAT- ALL INSTITUTIONS HAVE SO FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING.
