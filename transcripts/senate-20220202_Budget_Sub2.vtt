00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:05.350
ESSENTIALLY USED FOR- ENTITIES

UNDER- SB THIRTY TWO SUCH THAT.

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:15.193
WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE OFFSETTING

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.195
LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF ENTITIES TO

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.730

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:33.311
COMES TO LISA CANYON- AND IT

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.046
TOOK A MASSIVE LAWSUIT FROM THE

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.134
LIKE. A SMART USE OF GREENHOUSE

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:58.002
GAS DOLLARS AND IT ALSO SEEMS TO

00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:00.371
CONTRAVENE THE UNDERLYING

00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:01.539
DIRECTIVE IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:02.607

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:55.112
SO WE CAN HELP ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:57.014
BEFORE WOULD MANDATE ELECTRIC

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:59.250
VEHICLES FOR EVERYBODY. WE HAVE

00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:01.652
A FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE WE WERE

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.487
WE WERE TOLD IN THE NINETIES AND

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:05.456
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:07.057
SAW WHEN WE PASSED AB THIRTY TWO

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:08.525
THAT WHEN THE STATE PASSED SB

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:10.227

LEAD THE WORLD AND WHAT WE HAVE

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:16.533
. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO USE

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.235
NATURAL GAS TO BRIDGE OURSELVES

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:20.938
INTO. SOLAR AND WIND AND ALL

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:23.007

BUSINESS RIPPLING THE STATE THAT

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:57.708
MEANS REVENUE SLING THE STATE.

GOVERNOR'S ASSUMPTIONS ARE. AND

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:13.343
YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A WIDE

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.978
VARIATION BUT WE DO THINGS-

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:18.015
THERE'S LIKELY TO BE- ABOUT TWO

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.583
BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN KIND

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:20.851

BUDGET YEAR- AND SO AFTER KIND

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:26.957
OF SOME OF THAT MONEY WOULD BE-

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.325
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED THAT

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.127
WOULD LEAVES. ROUGHLY SEVERAL

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:30.994
HUNDRED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.362

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:33.330
SPENDING SORT OF ABOVE AND

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:35.365
BEYOND WHAT THE- THE GOVERNOR'S

BUDGET ASSUMES- BUT I ALSO JUST

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.269
SORT OF REITERATE AGAIN THAT YOU

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:42.239
OF UNCERTAINTY. AND WE WILL UP

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:43.907
BY COMPLICATED. REVENUE

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:45.576

SALES. I'M MORE UP TO DATE

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:49.446
INFORMATION ON KIND OF MORE

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:54.852
RECENT ARCHIVE. SUBSEQUENT

OPTIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:56.653
MONTHS. SO THE- SO THING I

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.988
WANTED TO ON QUICK AS- REALLY

00:45:58.055 --> 00:45:59.022
MORE HONEST. SIDE AND JUST AN

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:01.558
ISSUE THAT. THE COME UP QUITE AS

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:03.427
MUCH IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT ONE

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:04.761
THING WE DO THINK THE

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:05.662
LEGISLATURE ONE I KIND OF THINK

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:06.663
ABOUT IS THE- CONTINUOUS

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.867
APPROPRIATIONS SO A LOT OF THE

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:10.434
DISCUSSION AND USE. AND CAN

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:11.702
BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS ARE

00:46:11.768 --> 00:46:12.636
RUN AROUND THROUGH THE

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:13.604
DISCRETIONARY PACKAGE BUT WE DO

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:14.838
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:16.073
LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO THINK

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.908
ABOUT. THOSE CONTINUES

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:20.410
APPROPRIATIONS 65% OF THEM

00:46:20.477 --> 00:46:22.312
ROUGHLY SORT OF SORT OF THE

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:22.779
REVENUES CONTINUOUSLY

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:25.048
APPROPRIATED- AND SUPPORTING

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.583
CONNECT- DID YOU NEED TO THINK

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.619
ABOUT WHETHER THOSE ARE. THE

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:29.086
LEGISLATURE IS HIGHEST

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:31.321
PRIORITIES. MOST OF THOSE

00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:32.523
CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS WERE

00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:34.758
AGREED UPON AS PART OF THE

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:35.592
TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN BUDGET

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:36.627
PACKAGE OWN PRIORITIES CAN

00:46:36.693 --> 00:46:38.729
CHANGE- SO WE THINK IT'S ALWAYS.

00:46:38.795 --> 00:46:40.030
IMPORTANT THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:41.098
KIND OF CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:44.368
THOSE- ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT- IN

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:45.702
A WORLD WHERE REVENUES ARE

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:50.607
HIGHER. AND QUITE A BIT HIGHER.

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:52.276
THE PAST TO WONDER ARE GONNA.

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:53.844
BASELINE REVENUE AS- CONTINUES A

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:54.845
PROGRAM. AND ROUGHLY TWICE AS

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.914
HIGH AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN MANY

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.448
GREAT. YEAR SOME SORT. OF THAT

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.184
MAKES IT WE THINK SORT OF MORE

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:00.984
TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO AT THOSE

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:02.653
THINK ABOUT WHETHER THOSE.

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:05.155
CONTINUE TO REFLECT WHAT

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.089
PRIORITIES. UNDER DISCUSSION

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:07.824
EXPENDITURE PLAN OF COURSE

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.026
THERE'S A LOT OF THIS ALWAYS

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:10.928
COMES DOWN TO. PRIORITIES

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:12.529
BETWEEN. THE LEGISLATURE NOT

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:13.797
PRIORITIZES GREENHOUSE GAS

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:15.199
EMISSIONS VERSUS LOCAL AIR

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:18.502
POLLUTION. AND OTHER FACTORS- I

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:19.970
GOT THINKING ABOUT THIS YEAR IN

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:21.104
PARTICULAR THINKING ABOUT HOW IT

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:22.439
SORT OF FITS IN WITH OTHER FUND

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:23.774
SOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.509
ARE PAYING FOR MANY OF THESE

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:26.310
ACTIVITIES. AS AIRPORT WENT

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:27.644
THROUGH NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:29.112
THAT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE SPACE

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:30.514
FROM OTHER FUND SOURCES OF

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:31.682
THINKING ABOUT HOW THE-

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.016
GREENHOUSE GAS PIECES FIT

00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:35.152
TOGETHER WITH THE GENERAL FUND

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:36.787
USES ANOTHER FUND SOURCES. THE

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:38.355
LAST THING AND I JUST WANNA

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:39.990
TOUCH ON REAL QUICKLY IS THE

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:40.624
THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:42.526
ALSO FOR MOBILE MONITORING THIS

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:45.162
IS REALLY. THE ONLY NEW PROPOSAL

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:48.198
AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S- BUDGET I

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:51.201
G. R. F. BUDGETS- WE DO THINK

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:52.102
THAT YOU KNOW AND CONCEPT

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:54.037
BETTER. AIR QUALITY MONITORING

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.439
AND KIND OF BETTER INFORMATION

00:47:55.505 --> 00:47:57.274
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF AIR

00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:59.309
QUALITY- IS- IS SOMETHING THAT

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:01.979
HAS. BEEN AMERICA- I THINK- OUR

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:03.614
MAIN QUESTIONS ARE WE THINK IT'S

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.582
REALLY COMMON CLEAR. WHY THIS A

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:07.017
PROPOSED APPROACH IS THE BEST

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:09.086
APPROACH TO KIND OF GETTING THAT

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:09.753
TYPE OF INFORMATION. SOME OF THE

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.988
QUESTIONS I THINK WE WANTED TO

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:12.389
FIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE WHICH-

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.057
AND I WANT TO KIND OF- ASKED THE

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:15.792
ADMINISTRATION TO. COMMENT MORE

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:18.328
ON IT WHICH IS WHY IS WHY KIND

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:26.937
OF ABOUT THE SORT OF NEW MOBILE. MONITORING APPROACH RATHER

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:28.105
THAN. SOME OF THE OTHER

00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:28.739
EXISTING- EFFORTS WE HAVEN'T.

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:30.941
LIKE THAT SIX. MY UP JUST OF

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:33.910
EXPANDING UPON THAT- WHY DON'T

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:34.978
YOU RELY. MONITORING RIGHT THAN

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.013
SORT OF STATION MONITOR. TO DO

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.514
SOME OF THAT WERE. AND WHY A

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:39.416
KIND OF FOCUS ON THIS ONE TIME

VERY VERY SORT OF TAILORED AND

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:39.870

BLOCK BY BLOCK LEVEL AROUND THE

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:52.816
ENTIRE STATE. AND SO THE GOAL OF

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.418
THIS IS REALLY TO JUST TAKE THAT

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:56.420

THERE THEY CAN GIVE YOU OVER.

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:22.712
TOXIC NUMBER THAT THAT'S THERE

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:24.714
SO THEY GIVE YOU A VARIETY OF

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:26.650
DIFFERENT THINGS- AT THE DATA

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.185
THAT'S IMPORTANT MAYBE THE LOCAL

00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:30.053
COMMUNITIES NOT ASKING ABOUT IT.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.354
MAYBE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.156
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A HIGH

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:34.624
METHANE SO WIDE LIMITED JUST TO

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:37.127
THIS ONE. MEASUREMENT VERSUS ALL

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:39.095
THESE OTHER TOXICS AND HAZARDOUS

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:40.764

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.699
MAY BE SKY HIGH WHAT WAS YOUR

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.568
THINKING. WILL BE INTENSE IS

SYSTEMS ALSO TO MONITOR FOR

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.246
METHANE SO I THINK THAT THOSE

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:58.315
ARE THINGS THAT COULD BE ROLLED

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.450

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:17.440
OSTENSIBLE THESIS FOR SPENDING

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:20.243
THIS FUNDING SO I DON'T I DON'T

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:20.744
ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE NOT

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.078
TRACKING THE NUMBERS AND I.

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:24.881
WOULD REJECT THAT PREMISE I ALSO

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:25.482
THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN IT

00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:28.284
COMES TO THINGS LIKE- COUNTY

00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:31.187
FOREST CARBON- THAT THAT THAT

00:56:31.254 --> 00:56:35.024
WOULD BE. A FINE FINE CONCEPT-

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:36.593
ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANTED TO

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:38.094
INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:41.231
INVENTORY. AND MAKE THAT SUBJECT

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:43.299
TO COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS LIKE

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:45.101
THE OTHER REPORTING ENTITIES ARE

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:46.636
SUBJECT TO BUT I DON'T THINK

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:48.471
THAT THAT. THAT NECESSARILY IS

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:50.006
IN THE INTEREST OF THAT INDUSTRY

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:51.574
AT THIS POINT SO WE HAVE NOT

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:52.909
SEEN THAT KIND OF PROPOSAL TAKE

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:55.078
ANY SHAPE SO I DON'T CONSIDER

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:57.547
THE SENATE- VERARCHING CRITIQUE

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.682
NECESSARILY OF HOW THE-

00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:01.084
ADMINISTRATION OF THE AIRPORT'S

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:02.318
TRACKING THE DOLLARS I. THINK

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:03.987
IT'S VERY DETAILED AND

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:06.456
METICULOUS- MY QUESTION WAS JUST

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.091
MORE ABOUT WHAT PERFORMANCE WE

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:09.793
SEEN HOW MANY UNITS FOR INSTANCE

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:11.127
ARE HOW MANY BEDS WE THINK WE'RE

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:12.729
GOING TO GET BUILT OUT OF THE-

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:14.030
THE NEARLY BILLION DOLLARS WE

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:15.932
JUST SPENT AND HOW WE'RE DOING

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:17.834
ON A- SORT OF DOLLAR PER BED

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:19.702
BASIS NOT NECESSARILY A DOLLAR

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:22.105
PER TON BASIS- BECAUSE- LOWEST

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.773
DOLLAR PER TONNE EX. INVESTMENTS

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.375
AREN'T ALWAYS THE SMARTEST FOR

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:26.676
THE PUBLIC TO BE MAKING IT STUFF

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:27.944
THAT ACTUALLY PRIVATE SECTORS IN

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:29.012
A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO BE

00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:30.947
MAKING. AND I OFTEN THINK WE

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:32.982
SHOULD BE REACHING- WE ARE IN

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.217
THE FUNDING THE LOW INCOME

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:36.085
HOUSING FUNDING AND THINGS THAT.

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:37.687
MAY NOT LOOK LIKE THE LOWEST

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:38.922
DOLLAR PER TIME BUT ACTUALLY ARE

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:39.923
THE BIGGEST GAP IN THE BIGGEST

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:41.658
NEEDS SO. IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:44.727
GET SOME ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK ON

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:46.729
IT- WHAT WASN'T AWARDED DURING

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:49.799
THE LAST OF HSE AND WHAT'S

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:50.466
ANTICIPATED FOR THE FUTURE

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:52.669
FUNDING ROUNDS- THAT WOULD BE

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:53.970
VERY INTERESTING TO ME AND

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.238
ESPECIALLY HOW IT INTERFACES

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.340
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S. COMMITMENT

00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:59.542
ON INFILL- FUNDING AROUND

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:01.511
AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK THERE

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.046
WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF TWO

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:04.113
BILLION DOLLARS SO. MY QUESTION%

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.182
JUST FOR FOLLOW UP IS ABOUT HOW

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:08.251
THE CHSE PIECE WELL SORT OF

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:10.486
INTERACT WITH- THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:12.622
PROPOSAL FOR SURE MORE INITIAL

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:13.790
TRANSIT ORIENTED AFFORDABLE

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:15.625
DEVELOPMENTS. AND WHETHER THOSE

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.227
TWO PROGRAMS ARE TALKING TO EACH

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:21.364
OTHER AND WHETHER- WHETHER ALSO

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:24.968
THE EXTREME HEAT STRESS. CONCERT

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:26.636
INTEGRATED SO ARE ALL THOSE ARE

00:58:26.703 --> 00:58:28.304
TODAY PROGRAM TALKING TO OTHER

00:58:28.371 --> 00:58:29.339
SO HOPEFUL FOR FUTURE. BY IN

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:31.774
WRITING HEARING WE CAN GET INTO

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:32.809
. IT WILL DEFINITELY REACH OUT

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:34.744
TO OUR OUR COUNTERPART- INDUSTRY

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.479
THAT PROGRAM AND I GUESS DIGITAL

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:52.562
DIESEL. I MISS IT. HI YOU'LL GET

CONTINUOUS- APPROPRIATION WITHIN

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:04.307
CAP AND TRADE- THE ONE ITEM I

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.109
JUST THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:07.810
TO BE ABLE TO FLAG AS WE MOVE

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:10.580
FORWARD. IS ON SEA LEVEL RISE.

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:14.417
AND IT MAY BE TIME AT CANDIDLY

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:16.486
IT'S PAST DUE TO HAVE A

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:18.521
CONVERSATION ABOUT SEA LEVEL

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:20.957
RISE. IN THE DOLLARS THAT MAY BE

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:22.158
AVAILABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:25.428
PLAN FOR THAT CRISIS THAT'S

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:26.562
KNOCKING ON OUR DOOR. THANKS TO

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:27.797
THE LEADERSHIP OF CARE RIGHT

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:29.933
CASKEY IN THIS BUDGET SUB LAST

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:32.302
YEAR. THIRTY ONE MILLION ONE

00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:34.804
TIME WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.973
COASTAL COMMISSION. ON SEA LEVEL

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.875
RISE AND PROVIDING LOCAL

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:42.045
ASSISTANCE GRANTS- BOTTOM LINE

00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:44.514
IS THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.516
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT IS GOING

00:59:46.582 --> 00:59:48.251
TO BE LAPPING UP AGAINST.

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.552
COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:52.155
CALIFORNIA COAST. AND THE NEED

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:55.458
IS BEYOND GREAT SO I THINK THIS

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:56.392
IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.194
NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:58.828
FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT. I

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:01.531
KNOW THAT IT WOULD. ADD ANOTHER

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:03.700
PERMANENT CATEGORY. AND AT THE

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.601
SAME TIME THOUGH- THE LONGER WE

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:06.970
WAIT THE WORSE IT'S GOING TO GET

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.671
WE HAVE LITERALLY TENS OF

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.306
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CHEST IN

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.976
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. LET ALONE

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:14.444
AND THE IMPACT IT IS GOING TO

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.213
HAVE ON HOUSING. AND ECONOMIC

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.948
DEVELOPMENT WITH BUSINESSES

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:19.816
SUGGEST SOMETHING ALONG THE

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:22.785
FLAG. AND THIRTY ONE MILLION

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.620
SIMPLY IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:28.057
BUT THE COST COMMISSION.SHORT

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:30.426
TERM ESPECIALLY LONG TERM. AB

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.528
OF. SWEDEN I KNOW WE HAVE TO

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:33.930
MOVE ON HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:35.898
L. A. L. ON THE IDEA OF A

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:38.735
RESERVE THAT WE WOULD USE. LET'S

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.169
LET'S STIPULATE THAT IT'S A

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:42.572
VOLATILE MARKET. NOBODY WANTS TO

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:43.606
PUT THE CRYSTAL BALL AND SEE

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:44.907
WHAT THE OPTIONS COULD BE LIKE

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.776
IN TWO WEEKS BUT IT IS RIGHT

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.177
AROUND THE CORNER. AND YOU

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:50.179
SUGGESTED IF WE IF WE GET FOUR

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:52.415
BILLION DOLLARS OR FIVE BILLION

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:55.284
DOLLARS 210% RESERVE WOULD BE

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.619
FOUR HUNDRED TO. FIVE HUNDRED

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.287
MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WOULD WE

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:01.057
WOULD YOU SERVE WHY WOULDN'T WE

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:03.693
TAKE THAT OUT OR STRUCTURE IT AS

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.627
PART OF THE CONTINUOUS

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.596
APPROPRIATION SO THAT THE

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:09.132
DISCRETIONARY NUMBERS. TO FUND

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.667
THESE. NEW PROGRAMS WHAT WITH

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:12.702
THAT WHY WOULD THAT NOT BE A

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:14.470
BETTER. ARCHITECTURAL STEP TO

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:18.307
TAKE RATHER THAN TAKE IT OUT OF

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:21.778
THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS. I MEAN

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.846
I THINK A LOT OF IT JUST SORT OF

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:26.416
COMES DOWN TO AGAIN KIND OF-

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:27.750
PRIORITIES I MEAN SORT OF THE

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:28.785
WAY AS YOU'RE SORT OF I THINK

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.553
YOU'RE REFERENCING SORT OF THE

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.754
WAY IT'S SET UP NOW IT'S SORT

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:35.224
OF- YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE SORT

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:36.392
OF SHUTTERS. REVENUE VOLATILITY

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.061
THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS DO

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:40.063
LIKE OF REVENUE WERE DROPPED FOR

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:40.696
EXAMPLE THAT CONTINUES TO GROW

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:42.265
CREATIONS. DO AUTOMATICALLY

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:44.500
DON'T GO DOWN SO IT DOES SORT OF

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:47.070
HAVE A- BUILT IN MECHANISM THERE

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.738
WHERE IT KIND OF HELPS THAT SORT

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:50.606
OF BOTTOM LINE RESERVE. FUND SO

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.442
IT THAT'S KIND OF ALREADY. BUILT

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:53.943
IN THERE BUT THEN THE REST OF

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.545
THE STATIONARY PROGRAM SORT OF

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:57.480
YOU KNOW HAVE TO KIND OF HAVE A

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:58.581
RESERVE IN THE FUNDS TO KIND OF

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.750
COVER. IT WHATEVER THEY MIGHT

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.652
LOSE ANY REVENUE DROPS SO. BLOOD

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:03.519
SUGAR COULD SORT OF YOU KNOW

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:06.489
KIND OF- RE SHRINKS OUT I MEAN

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.490
THAT'S PART OF THE KIND OF

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.758
DISCUSS ANY ANY DISCUSSION THAT

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.026
MIGHT OCCUR AROUND CONTINUOUS

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:13.496
APPROPRIATIONS- I THINK A LOT OF

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.997
IT JUST DEPENDS ON. HOW ONE

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.833
WHICH PROGRAMS YOU PRIORITIZE

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:18.868
AND TWO IF YOU ARE GOING TO

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.536
CONSPIRACY APPROPRIATE MONEY.

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:22.004
MAYBE THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.606
NOT YOU WANT. FOR THOSE HIGH

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:24.841
PRIORITY PROGRAMS WHETHER YOU

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:25.875
WANT THEM TO COME OUT.

AUTOMATICALLY GET A SORT OF

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.845
LOWER OR HIGHER SURE REVENUE

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.581
DEPENDING ON AUCTION PROCEEDS BY

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.349
KIND OF HAVING A PERCENTAGE OR-

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.051
YOU KNOW ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:36.385
TO ANNOUNCE. CONTINUOUSLY

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.887
APPROPRIATE A CERTAIN DOLLAR

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.188
AMOUNT SET KIND OF WHATEVER

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.457
THOSE. HIGHEST PRIORITY PROGRAMS

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.926
ARE LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH- LIKE

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:46.362
THE LEGISLATURE IS DONE WITH-

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.364
FOREST RELATED- ACTIVITIES AND

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.233
SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.434
CONSTRUCT. YOU KNOW HOW TOKIND

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.401
OF GET THAT REVENUE VOLATILITY

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:53.669
AND HOW YOU. CAN MAKE SURE

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:55.438
WHATEVER YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:58.207
TARGETS TO THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.909
THAT YOU'RE- THAT YOU TO GO TO

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:01.811
GO TO THEM- SO I THINK THAT'S

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:02.745
JUST KIND OF PART OF THAT BIGGER

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.080
BROADER CONVERSATION WE'RE HAPPY

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:06.482
TO KINDA- YOU KNOW PROVIDE KIND

CURRENT. A LOS ARE. THERE ARE

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:04.473
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:07.943
WHY- AND- BECAUSE- SOME

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:09.778

BERMAN A PROTECTION AGENCY

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.275
OVERSEES THE COOPER PROGRAM. SO

WE DO THE SAME CONCERT WITH

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:43.879

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:57.959
SITUATION OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THEM

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.561
HAVE A LACK OF RESOURCES AND

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.396
OTHERS NEED ADDITIONAL TRAINING

IS A NEED FOR. GOVERNANCE CHANGE

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:03.845
IS HOW THE COOPERS ARE ORGANIZED

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:05.113
TO MAKE SURE THEY DO THEIR WORK

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.582

TO BE LOOKING LIKE. I WOULD SAY

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:58.032
THAT. THIS REFLECTS THE

01:23:58.099 --> 01:23:59.300
IMPORTANCE WE PLACE ON

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:00.969

THE NORMAL SWING HIGH AND SO

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:32.921

THEY COLLECT THE INFORMATION AND

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:43.091
DOCUMENTED IN A WAY THAT

01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:45.193
SUPPORTS THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:46.661

VIOLATIONS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:02.610
THAT WE'RE TRYING THOSE

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:04.445

ABILITY AND THEN AS WE MOVE

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:20.028
FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THE

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:23.231

VIOLATIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE MAY

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:49.957

RAINBOW BUT HOW DO YOU- YOU KNOW

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:22.090
I THINK THE BIGGEST

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:23.791
ENVIRONMENTAL THE TRAGEDY WE

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:24.759

THE BOYER. WHAT BUSINESSES ARE

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.503

AGAIN AT. YEAH HERE WE AWARE

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:13.594
THOSE MOST OF THESE ARE. RURAL

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:41.602
CAL SCREEN AND HAVE THE

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:43.337
CALIFORNIA JUSTICE AND RACIAL

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:46.106
EQUITY A PROGRAM WITHIN EPA ON

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.574
THE PROGRAM PRINCIPLES OF

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:50.878
FAIRNESS AND- THE CALLS FOR YOU

01:40:50.944 --> 01:40:55.082
KNOW. OUR FAIRNESS REGARDLESS OF

01:40:55.149 --> 01:41:00.387
RACE COLOR AND- WHEN CHRIS COLOR

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:03.557
NATIONAL ORIGIN SO YES WE ALL

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:06.193
AGREED THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATE

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.028
IMPACT ON DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:11.698
WELL AWARE THAT WHY A NEW OFFICE

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:15.269
WHY NOT SHE IS INTEGRATED INTO.

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:19.773
THE. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.108
OFFICES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PUT

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:24.478
IN CARP. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:25.746
AND SO I THINK I WOULD I WOULD

01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:27.080
CLARIFY SOME OF THOSE POINTS I

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:28.515
THINK SOME OF THOSE OFFICES THAT

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:30.184
WERE REFERENCED ARE NOT WITHIN

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.952
CARP RIGHT SOME OF THOSE OFFICES

01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:34.421
ARE WITHIN THE CALIPARI GA AND

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:35.823
SO I THINK WHAT WE DO HAVE

01:41:35.889 --> 01:41:37.191
WITHIN CARP RIDES WE HAVE THE

01:41:37.257 --> 01:41:38.492
OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:40.694
AND- WHAT WE HOPE TO CREATE AS

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:42.095
THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY. AND

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.864
SO PART OF I THINK WHAT IS SO

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.065
IMPORTANT AND SO VITAL AS WE'RE

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:46.567

01:41:46.633 --> 01:41:49.102
THINKING ABOUT AND MAKING SURE

01:41:49.169 --> 01:41:50.170
THAT WE'RE TRUSTING IN

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:51.672
RESPONDING TO THE COMMUNITIES OF

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.140

ABOUT THIS WORK WE'RE TALKING

01:42:08.889 --> 01:42:09.990
THAT THIS EFFORT OF COURSE IT'S

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:11.825
DEFINITELY GONNA WORK CLOSELY

01:42:11.892 --> 01:42:13.827
WITH I THINK HOW THE PA OF THE

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:15.128
OFFICES THAT THEY HAVE CREATED.

01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:16.597
BUT IT'S REALLY MEANT TO FOCUS

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:18.065
ON WHEN WE ARE CARP DEVELOPING

01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:19.566
OUR REGULATIONS ARE POLICIES

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:21.168
WHAT PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITIES

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:22.703
HOW ARE WE DOING THAT IN A WAY

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:24.171
WHERE WE ARE DISMANTLING AND

ADDRESSING RACE AND RACISM IN

01:42:30.077 --> 01:42:32.079
ALL ITS FORMS. AND SO I WOULD

SAY THAT THIS TO NEED ADDITIVES

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:35.215
AND I THINK I CAN GIVE AND I

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:36.683
THINK THE CRIME AND I THINK AS

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:37.951
YOU ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED RIGHT.

01:42:38.018 --> 01:42:39.486
WE NEED THIS KIND OF TYPES OF

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:40.821
OFFICES MUZAFFER X. MORE THAN

EVER IF WE REALLY ARE GOING TO

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:44.258
BE SERIOUS ABOUT RACISM AND

01:42:44.324 --> 01:42:45.659
REALLY ADDRESSING IT WITHIN OUR

01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:46.960
OWN INSTITUTIONS BUT WHAT WHAT

THEY HAVE TWENTY SEVEN DIFFERENT

01:42:57.738 --> 01:42:59.940
AGENCIES THAT GO ON WE DON'T

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.875
HAVE AN OFFICE OF EQUITY RACIAL

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:02.709
EQUITY IN EACH OF THE

01:43:02.776 --> 01:43:04.945

THE WHOLE. AGENCY IF THAT'S A

01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:43.951
GOAL. I MEAN I DON'T SPEAK FOR

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:45.619
EVERY AGENCY BUT WHAT I WILL

01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:48.422
SAY- AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS NOT

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:49.590
AN HONEST ANSWER I WOULD SAY ONE

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:52.392

CARVE AS A ARE RULES ARE RULES

01:43:54.194 --> 01:43:55.295
TO IMPLEMENT RIGHT AND SO THAT'S

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:57.030
WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON I THINK

01:43:57.097 --> 01:43:58.131
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I

01:43:58.198 --> 01:43:59.967
WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT I DO

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:01.802
THINK THAT WE NEED OFFICE IS A

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:04.037
RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:05.172
AND THAT MEANS THAT I THINK YOU

01:44:05.238 --> 01:44:06.940
KNOW WE DO A HAVE KELLY K. NOT

01:44:07.007 --> 01:44:09.042
COORDINATING ROLE BUT- I WOULD

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:10.510
SAY THAT WE ALL OF THE DOUBTS

01:44:10.577 --> 01:44:11.712
SOMEONE THAT'S LOOKING AT. AND

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:13.213
ASSESSING AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.015
THE POLICIES AND THE PROGRAMS

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.016
THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE COMING

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:18.385
OUT ARE ACTUALLY ADDRESSING AND

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:19.987
THINKING THROUGH THE IMPACT

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.521
THEY'RE HAVING ON COMMUNITIES

01:44:21.588 --> 01:44:23.023
THROUGHOUT RACIAL LINES AND

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.891
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE IT I

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:26.059
THINK THAT'S WHAT COMMUNITIES

01:44:26.126 --> 01:44:27.861
HAVE BEEN PUSHING AND CALLING

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:29.663
OUT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.598
I THINK YOU KNOW OUR NATIONAL

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:32.766
LEVEL WE'RE SEEING AT A

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:34.334
STATEWIDE LEVEL AND WE'RE SEEING

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.936
IT RIGHT NOW EVEN LOCALLY. AND

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:37.404
SO THE MORE THAT I THINK WE CAN

01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:38.438
BE RESPONSIVE THE MORE THAT WE

01:44:38.505 --> 01:44:40.707
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW IF

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:43.477
WE IF WE DON'T HAVE A FOCUSED

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:45.345
RIGHT NOW WHO IS GOING TO FOCUS

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:47.681
ON IT RIGHT NOBODY AND THAT'S

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:49.182
WHY I THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT

01:44:49.249 --> 01:44:50.484
I WILL ALSO JUST KIND OF PLAYING

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:51.985
OUT THAT RIGHT NOW OUR CURRENT

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:53.086
YOU KNOW OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:54.955
JUSTICE IS HONESTLY UNDER

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:56.757
RESOURCE. AND OVERSTAFFED AND

01:44:56.823 --> 01:44:58.692
THAT IS REALLY AT THE TYPICAL OF

01:44:58.759 --> 01:44:59.860
MOST ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:44:59.926 --> 01:45:01.995
PROGRAMS SO THIS REALLY WOULD BE

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:04.164
I THINK IN SOME WAYS A HUGE A

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:04.731
MODEL FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:06.066
OTHER AGENCIES ESPECIALLY IF

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:07.501
THEY'RE SEEING I THINK THE

01:45:07.567 --> 01:45:09.569
RECEPTIVENESS AND THE LEADERSHIP

01:45:09.636 --> 01:45:10.904
OF THE LEGISLATURE BIKE WHILE WE

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:12.272
UNDERSTAND THE SUPPORT GROUP WE

01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:14.408
WANT TO SUPPORT THIS ONLY WANT

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:20.947
TO SEE OTHERS FALL. THIS MODEL

01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:22.149
AS WELL. AND YOU DON'T THINK

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:23.016
THAT THE- ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE.

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:25.552
WHICH IS POSTED- IT RACIAL

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:27.354
EQUITY AND TO TRY AND CHOSE IN A

AND INFORM PARTNERSHIP GREEK

01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:32.993
BUILDING IS IN THE ATTIC TO DO

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:37.698
WHAT. I THINK I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:45:37.764 --> 01:45:39.533
THE MORE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:41.268
DEVOTE TO THIS THE BETTER I

01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:43.003
WOULD SAY THAT I THINK OF SOME

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.471
GREAT LIKE SO I DO OVERSEE THE

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:46.139

AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A STAFF

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:49.876
OF FIVE PEOPLE FOR AGENCY OF

01:45:49.943 --> 01:45:50.944
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE SUIT

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:52.012
JUST TO PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:29.276
AND PLACES WHERE WE HAVE LIKE

01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:31.745
REALLY. A HIGHER CONCENTRATION

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:33.747
OF POLLUTION AND THOSE

01:47:33.814 --> 01:47:35.649
COMMUNITIES ARE ALL UP FOR AND

01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:39.452

EARLIER. AND ALSO PAYING. A LOT

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:58.018
MORE FOR THEIR FUEL- AND THEY

DISADVANTAGED FOLKS NOW SOME

01:51:13.733 --> 01:51:15.435
PEOPLE THAT ARE WEALTHY CAN

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:17.037

YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE HEADED WITH

01:51:19.973 --> 01:51:20.807
THE CLIMATE BUT AT THE END OF

01:51:20.874 --> 01:51:23.376
THE DAY IF WE- ARE NOT TAKING A

01:51:23.443 --> 01:51:24.744
CLOSE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:51:24.811 --> 01:51:27.680

FURTHER TO THEIR JOBS. AND LIVE

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.689
IN POOR COMMUNITIES- THAT'S NOT

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:38.558
FAIR AND THEY'RE GETTING THEY'RE

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:40.994
PAYING THE BILL NOT MAY BE

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:42.429
DIRECTLY- BUT THEY'RE PAINTED

01:51:42.495 --> 01:51:43.763
INDIRECTLY THROUGH. THE

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:45.665
REGULATIONS THAT DRIVE UP THE

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:47.967
COST OF LIVING AND SO- I'M THIS

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:52.906
IS AN AREA THAT I THINK IS. NOT

01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:53.873
THE TRUTH IS NOT REALLY LAID OUT

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:54.974
VERY. MAINLY IN CALIFORNIA

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:57.243
ABOUT. WHO'S PAYING AND WHOSE

NOT FAIR IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE

01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:17.130
PEOPLE THAT. ARE ACROSS THE

01:52:17.197 --> 01:52:18.598

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:11.771
RATE THAN JUST THE G. CARE ACT

HAVE THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:25.551
REALLY FOCUSED ON AND THINKING

01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:26.953
ABOUT EQUITY AND HOW DO WE

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:27.920
OPERATIONALIZE THAT- MORE

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:28.755
TALKING ABOUT THE OFFICE OF

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.390
RACIAL EQUITY WE REALLY DO YOU

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:31.991
THINK ABOUT IT'S MUCH BIGGER AND

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:33.726
MUCH LARGER IN SCOPE. ONLY THINK

01:55:33.793 --> 01:55:35.295
ABOUT IT AS A PLACE WHERE WE

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:36.396
REALLY ARE THINKING ABOUT THE

01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:37.497
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RANKS ABOUT

01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:39.499
MID OF OUR POLICIES OUR SHIPPING

01:55:39.565 --> 01:55:40.833
OUR OWN CULTURE INTERNALLY WITH

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.402
OUR STAFF OUR BUILDING THAT

01:55:42.468 --> 01:55:44.137
COMPETENCY AND UNDERSTANDING

01:55:44.203 --> 01:55:45.271
AROUND RACIAL EQUITY AND HOW

01:55:45.338 --> 01:55:45.772
WE'RE PARTNERING WITH

01:55:45.838 --> 01:55:47.774
COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK THAT

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:49.108
IN SOME WAYS I WOULD SAY IT'S

01:55:49.175 --> 01:55:51.010
JUST. DIFFERENT THAN TO WHAT

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:53.146
WE'RE DOING I THINK IN TERMS OF

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:55.448
THE G. CARE ACT BECAUSE YES

01:55:55.515 --> 01:55:56.416
RIGHT THERE IS A POINT WE'RE

01:55:56.482 --> 01:55:57.984
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WITH-

01:55:58.051 --> 01:55:59.619
YEAH OFFICE RACIAL EQUITY BEING

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:01.154
VERY TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR AND

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.755
HOW WE GET CARP ARE ASSESSING

01:56:02.822 --> 01:56:04.624
FOR RACIAL EQUITY WITHIN OUR

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:05.692
REGULATIONS ON WITHIN OUR

01:56:05.758 --> 01:56:07.527
PROGRAMS AND THAT WILL LEAD TO

01:56:07.593 --> 01:56:09.028
KIND OF GREATER TRANSPARENCY I

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:10.530
THINK RIGHT NOW BUT THE

01:56:10.596 --> 01:56:11.764
LEGISLATURE FOR COMMUNITIES. AND

01:56:11.831 --> 01:56:13.299
I THINK IT'S MUCH QUICKER AND

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:14.667
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW ARE WE

01:56:14.734 --> 01:56:16.235
DEVELOPING OUR RAGS HOW ARE WE

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:17.403
THINKING ABOUT FROM THE FRONT

01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:19.572
AND ABOUT BURDENS CONSEQUENTLY

01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:22.041
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IMPACTS.

01:56:22.108 --> 01:56:24.210
THOSE PIECES RIGHT I THINK BY

01:56:24.277 --> 01:56:25.878
DOING THAT WORK RIGHT THAT'S

01:56:25.945 --> 01:56:27.647
ALSO GOING TO GRADUATION I COULD

01:56:27.714 --> 01:56:28.648
BE THINKING ABOUT OUR STAFF

01:56:28.715 --> 01:56:30.550
MAKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT WERE%

01:56:30.616 --> 01:56:31.918
BREAK AGAIN AND HOW REBUILDING A

01:56:31.984 --> 01:56:33.720
CULTURE WHERE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

01:56:33.786 --> 01:56:34.754
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO BE A

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:36.456
GREAT RACE THESE ARE HISTORIC

01:56:36.522 --> 01:56:38.257
INEQUITIES THAT OUR OWN COUNTRY

01:56:38.324 --> 01:56:39.592

ITS STATE LEVEL FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:42.862
AT A LOWER LEVEL AND WHAT DOES

01:56:42.929 --> 01:56:44.330
IT LOOK LIKE DISPENSED BY AS A

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:46.666
COVER AGENCY I THINK I'M TO KIND

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:47.667

01:56:49.769 --> 01:56:51.904
PROJECT THAT WE HAVE A MOST AND

01:56:51.971 --> 01:56:53.373
