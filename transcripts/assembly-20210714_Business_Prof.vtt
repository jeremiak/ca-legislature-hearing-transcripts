03:07:35.644 --> 03:07:37.212
PROCESS IS THE PUBLIC MEMBERS

03:07:37.279 --> 03:07:38.213
ON THE MEDICAL BOARD OF

03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:40.682
CALIFORNIA ARE NOT INVOLVED IN

03:07:40.749 --> 03:07:41.483
THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS FROM

03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:43.619
THE BEGINNING. THEY'RE INVOLVED

03:07:43.685 --> 03:07:44.820
AT SOME LATER STAGE OF THE

03:07:44.886 --> 03:07:46.989
PROCESS AND THE QUESTION IS THE

03:07:47.055 --> 03:07:49.057
ENTIRE PROCESS DOES THE ENTIRE

03:07:49.124 --> 03:07:51.126
PROCESS WORK IS IT EFFECTIVE.

03:07:51.193 --> 03:07:52.995
WE ALSO LEARNED AS YOU MAY

03:07:53.061 --> 03:07:55.163
RECALL THAT THEY SETTLE. I

03:07:55.230 --> 03:07:57.232
DON'T KNOW 82% OF THEIR CASES

03:07:57.299 --> 03:07:59.534
IN. EIGHTY SOMETHING PERCENT OF

03:07:59.601 --> 03:08:01.536
THE OF THOSE CASES THE

03:08:01.603 --> 03:08:03.805
SETTLEMENTS FAILED TO MEET. THE

03:08:03.872 --> 03:08:05.140
DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES THAT

03:08:05.207 --> 03:08:06.742
THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA

03:08:06.808 --> 03:08:08.910
PUBLIC ITSELF PROMULGATED AND

03:08:08.977 --> 03:08:11.446
PUBLISHED. SO WE NEED TO GET TO

03:08:11.513 --> 03:08:12.781
THE BOTTOM OF THAT WE NEED TO

03:08:12.848 --> 03:08:14.816
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS WHY THEY

03:08:14.883 --> 03:08:16.251
HAVE A HIGH SETTLEMENT RATE WHY

03:08:16.318 --> 03:08:18.286
MORE ARE TRIED. AND WHEN THEY

03:08:18.353 --> 03:08:19.454
DO HAVE A SETTLEMENT RATE WHY

03:08:19.521 --> 03:08:20.922
DON'T THE SETTLEMENTS MEET THE

03:08:20.989 --> 03:08:23.558
DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES. ADDING

03:08:23.625 --> 03:08:25.460
ONE OR TWO. OR THREE PUBLIC

03:08:25.527 --> 03:08:27.062
MEMBERS TO THE BOARD SINCE

03:08:27.129 --> 03:08:28.363
THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THE

03:08:28.430 --> 03:08:29.931
INTER DISCIPLINARY PROCESS I

03:08:29.998 --> 03:08:31.333
DON'T THINK GETS IS THERE AND

03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:34.102
SO. WE DECIDED YES THERE'S BEEN

03:08:34.169 --> 03:08:35.570
AN ENFORCEMENT MONITOR IN THE

03:08:35.637 --> 03:08:37.339
BOARD LONG BEFORE MY TIME BUT

03:08:37.406 --> 03:08:40.242
WE DECIDED TO PUT AN

03:08:40.308 --> 03:08:40.809
ENFORCEMENT MATTER INTO THE

03:08:40.876 --> 03:08:41.777
BOARD. WITH THE PROCESS THAT

03:08:41.843 --> 03:08:43.078
HOPEFULLY HAS SOME TEETH ON IT

03:08:43.145 --> 03:08:44.413
IN IT AND IF IT DOESN'T WE'LL

03:08:44.479 --> 03:08:46.314
PUT SOME TEETH TO IT. REQUIRE

03:08:46.381 --> 03:08:47.949
PERIODIC REPORTS AND A FINAL

03:08:48.016 --> 03:08:49.785
REPORT SO WE CAN GET TO THE

03:08:49.851 --> 03:08:51.286
BOTTOM OF HOW THIS ENFORCEMENT

03:08:51.353 --> 03:08:52.521
PROCESS THE MEDICAL BOARD

03:08:52.587 --> 03:08:54.022
WORKS. AND WHETHER THE MEDICAL

03:08:54.089 --> 03:08:55.357

03:08:55.424 --> 03:08:57.559
APPROPRIATE. DISCIPLINARY

VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS AND WE

03:09:22.451 --> 03:09:22.884
NEED TO ANALYZE THAT SO

03:09:22.951 --> 03:09:25.387
HOPEFULLY. THIS ENFORCEMENT

03:09:25.454 --> 03:09:26.722
MONITOR PROCESS WILL GET TO THE

03:09:26.788 --> 03:09:28.190

ADJUSTMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:09:36.865 --> 03:09:38.500
WAY THIS. MEDICAL BOARD OF

APPROPRIATENESS.

03:10:26.848 --> 03:10:29.217
INAPPROPRIATENESS PRESSES THESE

03:10:29.284 --> 03:10:30.819

PROVIDE US A REPORT AND WHAT

03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:33.054
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE

OUT IS HOW WE GET THE SPECIFIC

03:10:34.923 --> 03:10:36.558
DATA WITHOUT GETTING THE-

03:10:36.625 --> 03:10:37.592

03:10:37.659 --> 03:10:38.727
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THESE

03:10:38.794 --> 03:10:40.428
PERSONAL MATTERS THE COMPANY.

WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CRACK THAT

03:10:45.700 --> 03:10:46.101
NUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

MAYBE THERE. WAS A MAYBE

03:10:57.746 --> 03:10:58.647
THERE'S A REASON MAYBE THEY'RE

03:10:58.713 --> 03:11:00.182
TAKING TOO MANY COMPLAINTS

03:11:00.248 --> 03:11:01.850

MORE FORMAL PROCESS WHERE YOU

03:11:26.174 --> 03:11:28.677

APPROPRIATE CASES CASES SHOULD

03:11:39.554 --> 03:11:41.857
BE TRIED BUT WE NEED TO SORT OF

03:11:41.923 --> 03:11:43.258

03:12:14.956 --> 03:12:17.092
DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IN IN ANY

03:12:17.158 --> 03:12:20.595

THANK YOU MISTER JR. CENTER I

03:12:27.969 --> 03:12:29.905

TO THE COST RECOVERY FEES. MY

03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:34.542
FIRST QUESTION IS IT. UNDER

03:12:34.609 --> 03:12:35.043
THIS BILL WITH THE COST

03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:37.979
RECOVERY. PAUL ALTERNATELY ON

03:12:38.046 --> 03:12:39.447
THE PHYSICIAN OR ON THE

03:12:39.514 --> 03:12:41.549
POSITIONS- MALPRACTICE

03:12:41.616 --> 03:12:43.618
INSURANCE CARRIER I DON'T KNOW

03:12:43.685 --> 03:12:44.819
THE ANSWER TO THAT I WOULD

03:12:44.886 --> 03:12:46.588
SUSPECT THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH

03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:47.455
THE MALPRACTICE POLICY

03:12:47.522 --> 03:12:49.524
PROVISIONS BUT I DON'T REALLY

03:12:49.591 --> 03:12:51.493
KNOW. AND THE COST RECOVERY

03:12:51.559 --> 03:12:54.195
OBVIOUSLY APPLIES WHEN THERE'S-

03:12:54.262 --> 03:12:56.665
WHEN SOMEBODY'S LOST. YES

03:12:56.731 --> 03:12:58.900
RECOVER COSTS SO THE IF YOU YOU

03:12:58.967 --> 03:13:00.302
KNOW IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

03:13:00.368 --> 03:13:01.937
APPLY IF YOU SETTLE A CASE

03:13:02.003 --> 03:13:03.338
UNLESS THERE'S SOME AGREEMENT

03:13:03.405 --> 03:13:05.707
SO IF 82% OF YOUR COMPLAINTS

03:13:05.774 --> 03:13:07.742
ARE SETTLED. IF THAT REMAINS A

03:13:07.809 --> 03:13:09.577
STATISTIC I DON'T KNOW THAT

03:13:09.644 --> 03:13:11.546
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUGE

03:13:11.613 --> 03:13:13.081
NUMBER OF CASES BUT ONCE AGAIN

03:13:13.148 --> 03:13:15.050
I'M GUESSING TO SOME EXTENT WE

03:13:15.116 --> 03:13:16.618
ASK FOR SOME PROJECTIONS ON

03:13:16.685 --> 03:13:17.953
REVENUE RECOVERY ASSOCIATED

03:13:18.019 --> 03:13:19.988
WITH. WITH THE COST RECOVERY

03:13:20.055 --> 03:13:22.190
PRESENT A PROVISION IN. THE

03:13:22.257 --> 03:13:24.459
DATA THAT WE WERE PROVIDED AT

03:13:24.526 --> 03:13:26.227
LEAST IN AN INFORMAL WAY

03:13:26.294 --> 03:13:28.463
SUGGESTS THAT IT'S IN THE LOW

03:13:28.530 --> 03:13:30.465
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS POTENTIALLY.

03:13:30.532 --> 03:13:32.067
OKAY SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO YOUR

03:13:32.133 --> 03:13:34.502
RESPONSE TO THAT I GUESS CMA'S

03:13:34.569 --> 03:13:36.438
CONCERN THEY REYES WHICH-

03:13:36.504 --> 03:13:38.039
STRIKES ME AS IT MIGHT BE A

03:13:38.106 --> 03:13:39.240
WELL FOUNDED CONCERN WHICH IS

03:13:39.307 --> 03:13:41.142
THE SENSE THAT. THE COSTSOF

03:13:41.209 --> 03:13:43.411
THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE HARD TO

03:13:43.478 --> 03:13:45.280
KNOW UP FRONT AND CAN BE HIGHLY

03:13:45.347 --> 03:13:47.549
VARIABLE AND SOME OF THEM. I'M

03:13:47.615 --> 03:13:49.884
ASSUMING FROM WHAT THEY SAY CAN

03:13:49.951 --> 03:13:53.321
BE VERY. EXPENSIVE BY INSERTING

03:13:53.388 --> 03:13:54.389
A COST RECOVERY BACK IN THE

03:13:54.456 --> 03:13:56.791
SCHEME- OR THE SYSTEM I SHOULD

03:13:56.858 --> 03:13:59.594
SAY- ARE YOU CREATING AN

03:13:59.661 --> 03:14:01.463
INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO.

03:14:01.529 --> 03:14:03.098
LEVERAGE THE POTENTIAL OF AN

03:14:03.164 --> 03:14:04.866
EXPENSIVE COST RECOVERY THAT'S

03:14:04.933 --> 03:14:05.934
GOING TO BE THE BILL FOR WHICH

03:14:06.001 --> 03:14:08.003
WILL BE LAID. AT THE POSITION

03:14:08.069 --> 03:14:10.538

03:14:10.605 --> 03:14:13.575
THE TWO- JAHRBUCH ARE. ARE IS

03:14:13.641 --> 03:14:14.776
THAT COULD BE ABUSED IN A

03:14:14.843 --> 03:14:16.678
WHERE'S OUR POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE

03:14:16.745 --> 03:14:19.080
TO LEVERAGE. PEOPLE INTO JUST

03:14:19.147 --> 03:14:20.815
RESOLVING TO GET IT DONE

03:14:20.882 --> 03:14:21.750
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO END

03:14:21.816 --> 03:14:25.153
UP WITH. A HIGH SIX FIGURE BILL

03:14:25.220 --> 03:14:26.688
FOR THE INVESTIGATIVE COSTS

03:14:26.755 --> 03:14:27.655
WELL THEY DON'T HAVE IT NOW

03:14:27.722 --> 03:14:29.357
REMEMBER AND THESE THE THEY'RE

03:14:29.424 --> 03:14:31.793
SETTLING I DON'T REMEMBER

82284% OF MAY HAVE BEEN EIGHTY

03:14:33.128 --> 03:14:35.263
FOUR PERCENT. 84% OF THE CASES

03:14:35.330 --> 03:14:37.532
NOW SO I DON'T KNOW. THAT THAT

03:14:37.599 --> 03:14:39.200
CMA CONCERN HAS ANY LEGS

03:14:39.267 --> 03:14:41.369
FRANKLY. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S

03:14:41.436 --> 03:14:43.238
FAIR I LOOK AT THE SETTLEMENT

03:14:43.304 --> 03:14:45.140
PIECE ACTUALLY FROM THE MAYBE A

03:14:45.206 --> 03:14:46.341
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY I DON'T

03:14:46.408 --> 03:14:47.842
KNOW THAT THAT'S EVIDENCE THAT

03:14:47.909 --> 03:14:49.677
THE SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING. I

03:14:49.744 --> 03:14:52.881
MEAN GENERALLY ACROSS ALL SORTS

03:14:52.947 --> 03:14:55.450
OF. TYPES OF- DISPUTES I MEAN-

03:14:55.517 --> 03:14:57.052
A HIGH SETTLEMENT RATE IS.

03:14:57.118 --> 03:14:59.654
OFTEN A GOOD SIGN. RIGHT I MEAN

03:14:59.721 --> 03:15:01.122
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE RESOLVING

03:15:01.189 --> 03:15:03.058
THEIR THEIR THINGS WITHOUT.

03:15:03.124 --> 03:15:04.793
EXPENSIVE LONGER JUDICATA

03:15:04.859 --> 03:15:07.829
PROCESS OF IT WELL I THINK IF I

03:15:07.896 --> 03:15:14.836
CAN RESPOND I MEAN. THE SUNSET

03:15:14.903 --> 03:15:16.171
REVIEW HEARINGS AND YOU HAD

03:15:16.237 --> 03:15:18.039
CASES WHERE. THE POSITION

03:15:18.106 --> 03:15:19.541
RECEIVED A LETTER OF REPRIMAND

03:15:19.607 --> 03:15:21.009
AND IT WAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

03:15:21.076 --> 03:15:22.744
CASES I'M REMEMBERING. YOU HAVE

03:15:22.811 --> 03:15:24.112
PHYSICIANS WHO PERHAPS GOT A

03:15:24.179 --> 03:15:25.180

03:15:26.881 --> 03:15:29.584
WHATEVER THE TERM IS- IN CASES

WHERE. THERE WAS AN ADMITTED TO

03:15:31.686 --> 03:15:35.490
INSTANCE OF- OF DISHONESTY. SO

03:15:35.557 --> 03:15:37.258
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO KNOW IS

03:15:37.325 --> 03:15:38.793
THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF HAS

03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:41.029
TOLD US. THAT IN A HIGH

03:15:41.096 --> 03:15:41.930
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE SETTLEMENT

03:15:41.996 --> 03:15:44.065

THEY PROMULGATED. WE'RE NOT.

03:15:50.772 --> 03:15:51.806
ONE OR MORE THE CENTRAL ISSUE

03:15:51.873 --> 03:15:53.975
CENTREPOINT NOT SATISFIED SO

03:15:54.042 --> 03:15:55.210
THEY'RE NOT MEETING THEIR OWN

03:15:55.276 --> 03:15:57.112
DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES IN THE

03:15:57.178 --> 03:15:57.812
DISCIPLINE THAT THEY'RE

03:15:57.879 --> 03:16:01.282
IMPOSING. IN SETTLEMENT SO.

03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:02.750
THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM IT'S

03:16:02.817 --> 03:16:05.487
CERTAINLY INDICATED BY SOME OF

03:16:05.553 --> 03:16:07.489
