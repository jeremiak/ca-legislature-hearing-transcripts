SO- THE RESTAURANT ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES MISTER CHAIR R. I. GO AHEAD WILL LIMIT EACH YOU TO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS NONETHELESS MOST LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES- WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB THREE SIXTY ONE. I'D LIKE TO SAY FIRST THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT THE BUSINESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO CONTINUE AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS ATTEND WITH THIS BILL. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR NEED SOMETHING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM EXISTING BROWN APPLICATIONS- WHILE IT'S NOW TOO LATE TO AMEND THE BILL- WE HAD AFTER THE BILL BE AMENDED. TO REQUIRE MEMBERS OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO APPEAR ON VIDEO DURING PUBLIC MEETINGS. I WHENEVER TELECONFERENCING. US IN EIGHTY THREE SIXTY ONE NO LONGER REQUIRES LOCAL OFFICIALS TO PARTICIPATE IN PERSON SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PUBLIC MUST BE ABLE TO VIEW OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS- ON VIDEO SIMILAR TO AN IN PERSON MEETING- THIS WOULD PROMOTE CONFIDENCE THAT THE ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE ACTUALLY LISTENING TO PUBLIC COMMENT. AND WOULD BOTH BE SURE TRANSPARENCY AND PROTECT AGAINST IMPROPER INFLUENCE BY LETTING THE PUBLIC KNOW WHO ELSE IS PREGNANT. AT THE LOCATION FROM WHICH THE. ELECTED OFFICIAL IS PARTICIPATING- REQUIRED UP A INTERNET AND TELEPHONE OPTION ARE FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO IT. THE LIST BODY. TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS WHO LACKS THE INTERNET CONNECTION. OR HAVE NO INTERNET AT ALL ARE STILL ABLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE BY TELEPHONE. THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE COMMENT. VISUAL OR DECISIONS THAT WILL DEEPLY AFFECT OUR LIVES OF THAT MANY. AND LASTLY TO REQUIRED ELECTED OFFICIALS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. DO SO FROM WTHIN THE JURISDICTION AND THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY. EACH TELECONFERENCE. LOCATIONS HOWEVER YOU CAN SO WE'RE NOT MAY AND IT LIKE MAKE THEM. BUT WE MUST START RESPECTFULLY CONTINUE TO OPPOSE BILL. OUR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND TO THE ALL MAKING. ABOUT AND IT'S QUITE THAT A CHANGE TO THE BROWN ACT ENSURE THAT ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS INCONVENIENT ACT THAT. AND FULLY PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC MEETINGS IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER. AGAIN WE THINK THE AUTHOR BURGERS OPPORTUNITY AREA WE KNOW THIS BILL IS WELL INTENTIONED BURKE CONCERNED THAT IT MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR KNOW ABOUT. THE ONE THANK. YOU THANK YOU. HOMICIDE MEN ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES I AM THANK YOU CONNECTING ME WE CAN GO AHEAD. HELLO OKAY COOL THANK YOU I'M GOOD MORNING CARE NUMBERS MANY IS OLIVIA SIDE AND ENGAGEMENT CARD WITH COUNCIL PROJECT DISCOUNT ABILITY I COMMUTER BASED WORK. THAT ADVOCATES FOR EQUITABLE POLICIES IN EQUAL ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY ALONG FEDERAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE SAN JOAQUIN. VALLEY WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR STAFF AND SPONSORS FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON EIGHTY THREE EXPLAINED BUT WE UNFORTUNATELY MUST REMAIN OPPOSED AND WANTED TO RAISE SOME CONCERNS OVER THE NEWLY ADDED LANGUAGE. AROUND THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT WHICH WE ARE FREE DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN STATE LEVEL GOVERNMENTAL DECISION MAKING. IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS WE HAVE SEEN HOW TELECONFERENCE OPTION CAN MEANINGFULLY EXPAND ENGAGEMENT AT A LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT ARE COVERED BY THAT THINKING BUT WE HAVE ALSO SEEN. THE GAPS IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS ABILITY TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE AT THE STATE. SIMILARLY THE NEW LANGUAGE IN AB THE PLAN DOES NOT INCLUDE CLEAR ENOUGH LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY A PUBLIC COMMENT ACTUALLY PROTECT- WELL LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS MEANT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO COMMENT DURING TELECONFERENCE MEETING WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IF IT'S TRUE THEY CAN LEGALLY PROVIDE ADEQUATE PUBLIC COMMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE LANGUAGE THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY DEFINES THE TYPE. OF PUBLIC ACCESS THAT STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS MUST PROVIDE FOR EXAMPLE THE WAY THE WORD I DRAFT IS NOT CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE LANGUAGE THERE NO GUIDELINES FOR HOW AN AGENCY MUST PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT OPPORTUNITIES WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH HOW THIS LACK OF SPECIFICITY COULD POTENTIALLY HARM COMMUNITIES THE WORK WITH WHICH HAVE LOW RATES. OF BROADBAND ACCESS. APPLE A STATE AGENCY FILL THE PA WITH THE ALL. TO SUBMIT A COMMENT VIA EMAIL. TO SATISFY. THAT THE PUBLIC WAS ABLE TO. A THE BOARD. HOWEVER ABOUT ACCESS TO BROADBAND NOT BE TO GET THE UNDER THE SCENARIO. WE WOULD LIKE IF YOU LANGUAGE THAT MOISTURE. BECAUSE THE- OF ACT LEAVING NO ROOM IN THE- AND INSURING THAT ALL IF YOU COULD THE PROVIDING CONTRACT. GETTING. I THE CURRENTLY AB SIX. THANK YOU MISTER OF YOUR UP.

VERY QUICKLY AND- YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SURE AND YOU KNOW IN FACT- IN THIS THIS BILL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO AVOID YOU KNOW HAVING TO HAVE A HEARING AT THIS LATE STAGE OF THE GAME BUT THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SENATE LEADERSHIP. THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND IN FACT THIS VERSION OF THE BILL STRENGTHENS THE PROVISIONS AROUND- TO PUBLIC COMMENT- AND I THINK YOU YOU KNOW YOU JUST POINT TO. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BILL DOES IT CLARIFIES THAT THAT AGENCIES MUST PROVIDE AMPLE TIME FOR- IN LIVE- TO PUBLIC COMMENT- OFFERING. STATING THAT FOLKS. MUST REGISTER AND NOT REQUIRE THE PUBLIC TO- YOU KNOW AS- AS- AS- NEAR AS WAS THE CASE IN THE PAST TO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS IN LIEU OF YOU KNOW IN THE LIFE COMMENTS.

DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY- COUNTY DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCIES. WOULD BE BE GIVEN THE SAME TREATMENT AS ADULTS IN THE STATE DECLARES EMERGENCY.
