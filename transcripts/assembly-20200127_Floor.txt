THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR OF DEL DILIGENTLY WORKED ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. WHICH ILLUSTRATES HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO NOT ONLY ME. BUT EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS BILL OKAY FROM. THE DEATH OF GABRIEL FERNANDEZ WHO WAS AN EIGHT YEAR OLD CONSTITUENTS. WHO WAS REPEATEDLY BEATEN. TORTURED AND EVENTUALLY KILLED BY HIS MOTHER AND HER BOYFRIEND. HIS BODY WAS RIDDLED WITH BB GUN PELLETS CIGARETTE BURNS A FRACTURE IN THIS GOAL AND THEY FOUND THAT HE WAS FORCED TO INGEST CAT FECES. DURING THE LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS BILL. ANTHONY AVALOS NOR QUATTRO ALSO SUFFERED SIMILAR ABUSE RESULTING IN THEIR TRAGIC DEATH. ALTHOUGH IN EACH OF THESE CASES THERE ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE. THERE WAS NO ACTION TAKEN TO PREVENT EITHER OF THEIR DEATHS. THIS LEGISLATION RESTORES LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO ENTER DATA INTO THE CHILD ABUSE CENTRAL INDEX OTHERWISE KNOWN AS KHAKI. FURTHER IT DEVELOPS A PROCESS FOR AGREED PARTIES THAT WISH TO BE REMOVED FROM THE DATABASE OR FEEL THAT THEY DON'T DESERVE TO BE THERE. FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF GABRIEL FERNANDEZ ANTHONY HAVE A LOS NOR QUATTRO. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON CHILD PROTECTIVE. PROTECTION RECOMMENDED INCREASED COOPERATION BETWEEN DCFS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION WOULD AFFORD PROFESSIONALS EVALUATING POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS WITH THE WIDEST PERSPECTIVE POSSIBLE. THIS BILL IS A STEP FORWARD TO ESTABLISH A WORKING SYSTEM. THE FORMER DATABASE PROVED TO HAVE ISSUES AND PROBLEMS WHICH WE'RE HOPING TO ADDRESS THROUGH THIS BILL RATHER THAN RESTRICT THE CAPABILITIES OF PEACEMAKERS. ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN FIFTY WHICH THIS BILL AS A KNOWLEDGE IS THAT. MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO CREATURE CRACK FOR SINCE THE CASES TO FALL THROUGH. ALTHOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL ELIMINATE ALL CRACKS I DO BELIEVE THAT A WILL LIMIT THE LIKELIHOOD OF TRAGEDY SIMILAR TO GABRIEL ANTHONY AND NOAH.

THAT MEASURE FILE ITEM FIFTH NINE IS AB FOR NINE NINE READ AS LEGAL FIFTEEN NINE BY SO MEMBER CA AND PEACE OFFICERS MR. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS SOME OF YOU IN THIS BODY WERE AS FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WHICH CREATED. THE ABILITY UNDER CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET RECORDS OF INVESTIGATIONS INTO POLICE ACTIVITY WHEN IT INVOLVED AMONG OTHER THINGS SEXUAL ASSAULT PERPETRATED BY AN OFFICER. WELL UNDER COLOR OF LAW. AS PROUD TO STAND WITH THEM IN SUPPORT THAT MEASURE A FEW YEARS AGO BUT WE'VE SEEN THAT IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND THAT IS THIS IF AN OFFICER IS UNDER ACTIVE INVESTIGATION WHETHER INTERNAL AFFAIRS OR CRIMINAL. FOR SEXUALLY ASSAULTING SOMEONE WHILE ON THE JOB. THAT OFFICER UNDER CURRENT LAW CAN RESIGN. AND IF THEY RESIGN. THE PUBLIC NEVER HAS THE ABILITY TO GET THE RECORDS. OF THE INVESTIGATION INTO THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT. NOW YOU MAY BE THINKING THIS IS PROBABLY FAIRLY RARE AND YOU'RE RIGHT BUT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT HAPPEN ONCE IN A HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT WHERE AN OFFICER WHO ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED. A RAPE ON JUST ON THE JOB ON DUTY. A RESIGNED BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION INTO THAT WAS COMPLETED. AND THE RECORDS NEVER CAME TO LIGHT. THAT'S THE PROBLEM IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE AND WILL HAPPEN AGAIN LESS WE DO SOMETHING AND THE POINT OF THIS IS NOT TO GO AFTER PEOPLE THAT WERE FALSELY ACCUSED OF THINGS. IT'S TO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHERE THERE'S A SUSTAIN FINDING THAT THEY COMMITTED SOMETHING THAT SHOULD DISQUALIFY YOU PERMANENTLY FROM WEARING A BATCH. PERIOD AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ON THE JOB IT'S CERTAINLY IN THAT CATEGORY AND WE'VE ALREADY SAID THAT AS A STATE WHEN WE PASSED SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY THE ACLU. SUPPORTED BY THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHES PUBLISHERS.

THIS FOR. BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. BECAUSE I BELIEVE LIKE THEY DO THAT. BEING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS AN HONORABLE PROFESSION AND MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE IN IT DO THE JOB WITH INTEGRITY THEY RUN TOWARDS PROBLEMS THE REST OF US RUN AWAY FROM. AND THEY DESERVE OUR SUPPORT I BELIEVE ALL THOSE THINGS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THE TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS IMPORTANT AND THE PEOPLE THAT COMMIT. POSSIBLY CRIMINAL ACTS AGAINST BIG GUNS THAT THEY HAVE POWER OVER. A PROBATION OR PAROLE LEE THAT SOMEBODY THAT SAYS HEY IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT I WANT I'M GONNA BUST YOU AND TAKE YOU IN. SOME OF THE DAY IS THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE A BADGE EVER. AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT CONDUCT.

THANK YOU MISS CUNNINGHAM DR QUIRK WE ARE RECOGNIZED YES I DON'T THINK THIS- OFFENSES AS RARE AS DISTINCT SHOW.

FROM LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATIONS FUTURE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE COMMISSION. DURING THAT YEAR I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE WITH OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA. IT CONFIRMED A LOT OF WHAT I'VE ALREADY KNOW FROM MY DISTRICT. AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE FOR THE PROVIDERS IN MANY RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UCSF REPORT ESTIMATES THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE WILL HAVE A SHORTFALL OF FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA AND A NEED FOR ROUGHLY FORTY ONE HUNDRED MORE. BY TWENTY THIRTY. IN IT ALL THIS TO MEET THE EXPECTED DEMAND BY THE POPULATION. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS IN CALIFORNIA DROPPED BY 10% AT A TIME WHEN THE POPULATION GREW BY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CLEARLY HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. LIKE MANY OF YOU OF I ALWAYS SUPPORTED YOU STILL FUNDING FOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS WHICH ARE GREAT TOOLS ARE COSTING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF EVERY EVERY YEAR AND WE WILL NOT WILL NOT GET US TO THE POINT OF MEETING OUR WORKFORCE NEEDS. WE SIMPLY CANNOT BUY OUR WAY OUT OF THE SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THERE IS A TOOL THAT I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE IS NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S REFLECTED IN A NINETY WHICH WILL A NATIONALLY ACCREDITED NURSE PRACTITIONERS WITH A MINIMUM THREE YEARS ADDITIONAL REAL LIFE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. AND PRACTICE PROVIDE SERVICES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR STANDARDIZED SPUR OF PROTOCOLS BY PHYSICIANS. ISN'T WOULD BE REQUIRED PASS A NATIONAL A LICENSURE EXAM THAT ASSURES COMPETENCY. EXAM WOULD NEED TO BE VALIDATED BY AN ENTITY WITHIN DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND IF NOT TEAM SUFFICIENT SUPPLEMENTAL COMPONENTS FOR A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC EXAM. WOULD BE DEVELOPED THE REQUIRED. A MEMBERS FROM APPROACH ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS STRENGTH IN THE CLINICAL TIME BEFORE IN PEACE COULD PRACTICE WITHOUT PROTOCOLS. WHAT CALIFORNIA BE BREAKING NEW. GROUND THIS BILL. ACTUAL NOT. IN TWENTY TWO OTHER STATES. THEY DO THIS ALREADY. AT THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION THEY DO THIS ALREADY AND IN THAT NOT SO RURAL AREA OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THEY DO THIS ALREADY- AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THE BILL WOULD BE DISTRICT. IN THESE. THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR RESPECT TO. THERE ARE COUNTLESS DAY THAT SHOW AND PRAC SAFELY AND BECAUSE- WITH OUT THE OVERSIGHT OF POSITION. BUT NONE THE LESS INCLUDED TO DO A TIMER IN THE BILL TO SHOW THAT ALL THE MOST AND PEACE WILL BE ABLE TO PRAY WAY. NO NO NURSE PRACTITIONER RIGHT I OF SCHOOL QUALIFY UNDER THIS BILL. AND I AGREE WITH THAT APPROACH I BELIEVE THE BILL STRIKES A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS CARE AND THE NEED TO MAINTAIN QUALITY HEALTHCARE SERVICES. I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL HELP LARGE URBAN AS WELL AS RURAL AREAS. THE 59% OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE PROVIDING PRIMARY CARE ALREADY. WHILE ONLY 17% OF PHYSICIANS DO SO. NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT MEDICARE OUR AND MEDICARE AND THEN THEIR PHYSICIAN COUNTERPARTS 90% OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS WILL LIKELY SEE MEDI CAL MEDICARE PATIENTS COMPARED TO THEIRS TO ABOUT 64% FOR THEIR POSITION COUNTERPARTS. THESE NUMBERS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS FROM STUDIES I'VE READ SHOWN TO ME THAT ACCESS IS INCREASED WHEN SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS ARE REMOVED. ANALYSIS A PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH AND THERE IS A LOT OF IT HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IN PEACE PROVIDE CARE OF COMPARABLE QUALITY AS PHYSICIANS EVEN WITH AN PIECE PRACTICING WITH OUT POSITION- SERVICE OVERSIGHT. ASIAN SAYS IS HIGH WITH THERE'S PRACTICE. PRIOR THE OF PART PART INTRODUCED THE BILL AND THAT WITH OPPONENTS. I ASKED HIM FOR EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. AND I'VE RECEIVED NINE. WHAT I HAVE HEARD IS ANECDOTAL STORIES ABOUT THE PROBLEMS BUT THIS IS NOT. YOU'D STUDIES I WOULD EXPECT FROM THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. THE BILL SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION IS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE ESSENTIAL ACCESS HEALTH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE S. CI YOU A. R. P. R. C. R. C. AT LEAST FIFTY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EYE BELOW. THEY GET BACK TO WHAT DOCTOR ARAMBULA YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. YOU KNOW I WANT TO START IF I CAN- BY RESPECTING OUR COLLEAGUE AND CHAIR OF HEALTH WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS ISSUE AND CONTINUES TO CHAMPION THIS ISSUE. I MUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE CURRENT BILL THAT IS BEFORE US AND WOULD ASK THIS BODY TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME BEING DELIVERED. NOW I WOULD HAVE PERSONALLY APPRECIATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SEEN THIS IN COMMITTEE UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT HERE LAST YEAR WHEN THIS BILL WAS HEARD. IN COMMITTEE. AND BELIEVE THAT IN THE SECOND YEAR WE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL IF IT DOES NOT GET OFF THIS FLOOR TODAY. NOW I WANT TO RECOGNIZE MANY OF THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO I WORKED WITH FROM CHRISTY PALETA CHEN TEARS ON TO DENNIS LEVINE TO SANDY. BRITNEY AND CHRIS TOLD PEOPLE WHO HELPS TO EXPAND OUR PRACTICE AND WERE WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR ME OF QUALITY AND TRAINING THIS IS AN ISSUE OF GETTING IT RIGHT. AND THIS VERSION TO ME STILL HAS ISSUES IN ITS CURRENT FORM WHETHER IT BE WITH THE LACK OF A CORPORATE BAR OR ABILITY TO HIRE PHYSICIANS AT HOSPITALS WHICH IS NOT PRESENT IN THIS BILL. AND I JUST ASK US TO DO WHAT WE SAY WE DO IN MEDICINE WHICH IS TO MEASURE TWICE AND CUT ONCE. THIS BILL IS NOT QUITE READY IN pTHIS BODY ALLOW US MORE TIME SO THAT WE CAN GET IT RIGHT IN THIS UPCOMING YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THEY GET A CURRICULA MR LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I A RISE TO URGENT AYE VOTE I A RISE TO ALSO THANK THE MEMBER FROM HILLS BURKE OUR HEALTH ASSEMBLY HEALTH CHAIR OF THE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE STAFF MYSELF OF THE AUTHOR AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATION OUR OF CONVERSATION SINCE INCEPTION. AND IN FACT I RECALL- BEING IN MY DISTRICT- DURING THE BREAK A LAST YEAR TO WHICH- DOCTOR WOULD ASKED ABOUT MY OPINION ON THIS AREA OF TOPIC TO WHICH THE FALL UP THE FOLLOWING MONTH AND THEN THE FOLLOWING EACH AND THE FOLLOWING. I SO WE HAVE BEEN IN DEEP CUTS. WITH THIS IS. SINCE INCEPTION AS AS STAKEHOLDERS ALIKE AND OPPOSITION SO I JUST WANTED TO. CLARIFY THAT FOR MEMBERS A SHOULD THERE BE ANY ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION REQUIRED ON SAYING IF THERE'S BEEN AN EXHAUSTIVE CONVERSATIONS ON THESE ISSUES I CERTAINLY AS THIS BILL HOPEFULLY MOVES FORWARD OTHER THE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES ON CONCURRENT AND OTHERWISE FOR. THE FREE POLICY COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY TO HEAR THIS AGAIN TO WHICH I KNOW THAT WILL ALSO HAVE FEEDBACK BUT AS WE SIT HERE TODAY JUST GIVE LET'S THEY'VE I'M LIVE I REGION I BUILT. THANK YOU LOWE. THIS OF US HERE RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER YOU KNOW AN IRA A WELL IN SOME OF THIS BILL YEAH I LIKE TO THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA ROSA HILLS BIRD WHATEVER IT MAY BE. FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR OFFERING THIS BILL YOU KNOW I WANT TO THANK HIS STAFF WAS WORKED FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR. I WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON IN AN EFFORT TO CRAFT THE BEST POSSIBLE LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE HERE THIS AFTERNOON. YOU KNOW I AM A PROUD SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT IN A VERY POSITIVE AND PRONOUNCED WAY. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT AND AS I MENTIONED IN THE PAST ON THIS ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF YOU. I REPRESENT ABOUT. A RELATIVELY LARGE DISTRICT. PART OF FOR COUNTIES AND INCLUDES PARTS OF THE CENTRAL COAST OF CALIFORNIA CONSIDERED SUBURBAN RURAL. AND I REPRESENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FARMWORKERS. FARMWORKERS LIVING IN A RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WHO STRUGGLE TO FIND ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. NOW THIS BILL WILL ALLOW NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PRACTICE TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR TRAINING AND ABILITIES. NOW LOOK I SERVED AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR EIGHT YEARS PRIOR TO MY TIME HERE THE STATE ASSEMBLY. ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THE BEST POLICY IDEAS THAT I SUPPORTED. WITH THOSE THAT WE NEGOTIATED. THAT WE NEGOTIATED AND REFINED OVER SEVERAL MONTHS. AND IN MOST CASES IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS. NOW MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT POLICY IDEAS REFINED OVER TIME WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS LEAD TO THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AND THAT'S THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE. NOW THE POLICY IDEAS FORWARDED BY THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY ARE NOT NEW IDEAS. THE FAT IN FACT OVER TWENTY FIVE STATES ALREADY HAVE DONE THIS EXACT SAME THING. THE POLICY PROPOSAL BEFORE US TODAY HAS BEEN TRIED IT HAS BEEN TESTED. AND IT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO WORK. THIS POLICY IDEA HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IT HAS BEEN DELIBERATED THE RESEARCH IS COMPLETE WE HAVE THE DATA OUT BEFORE US. CALIFORNIANS NEEDS TO STAND UP AND DELIVER ON THE PROMISE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE. THIS POLICY WILL DO JUST THAT. AND IT'LL DIRECTLY IMPACT THE FARMWORKERS IN THOSE LIVING IN UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT. AND IN SIMILAR REGIONS ACROSS OUR STATE ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY IS GOOD PULIC POLICY. AND IT IS THE RIGHT THING FOR US TO DO SO I ORIGIN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THERE WAS RIVAS DOCTOR EGGMAN. YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I ALSO RISE. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- IN I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION MORE SAYING THIS IS GOING TO FAST TOO FAST I CAN MEMBERS OF MY VERY FIRST YEAR. IN OFFICE TWENTY THIRTEEN AS I WAS CARING FOR MY SISTER IN LAW SHE WAS DYING HE SHOULDN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE INSURANCE WHICH IS THE REASON THAT HER CANCER WENT UNDIAGNOSED. UNTIL THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF HER LIFE WHEN WE FINALLY WERE ABLE TO HAVE IT DIAGNOSED. AND I REMEMBER THE- THE CONVERSATION GOING ON THE COMMITTEE SAYING THAT THAT KERR WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH. AND I REMARK AT THE TIME WELL IT CERTAINLY WOULD HELP SOMETHING WOULD HAVE HELPED. IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WENT INTO SHE DIED IN. AUGUST OF TWENTY THIRTEEN IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN. HER LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. COULD HAVE BEEN POTENTIALLY SAVE. ISSUE THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WE KNOW WE'VE EXPANDED HEALTH CARE TO A LOT MORE PEOPLE NOW. THIS YEAR UP TO TWENTY SIX FOR THOSE UNDOCUMENTED. NOW WE WANT TO GO EVEN FURTHER FOR THOSE SENIORS. BUT WE NEED CARE PROVIDERS OF WE DON'T HAVE CARE PROVIDERS. THEN EXPANDING ACCESS DOESN'T REALLY MEAN NYTHING THEY'RE JUST WORDS. TWENTY TWO OTHER STATES ALREADY DO THIS. AND BEFORE MANY OF YOU ARE ALIVE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IS WHEN THE NURSE PRACTITIONER OF PROFESSION WENT INTO AFFECT TIME IMPROVED AS A COMBAT ARMY MEDIC I WORK WITH PLENTY OF THEM IN THE MILITARY SERVING IN THE VA SYSTEM IN THE MILITARY SYSTEM. AS WELL AS WITH OPPOSITION TO SYSTEM WE NEED EVERY WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF POSITIONS WE WOULD NEVER SAY THAT BUT IT'S ANOTHER OPTION FOR PRIMARY CARE. IS IN RURAL AREAS WHERE I ALSO REPRESENT BUT I ALSO. STOCKTON CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A- URBAN COMMUNITY. WITH A HIGH NEED OF CARE. VERY HIGH WRITTEN A LETTER TO THE PROPERTY AND VERY LOW NUMBERS OF PROVIDERS. THAT'S A SYSTEM A RECIPE FOR DISASTER AS WE SEE HIV TUBERCULOSIS THINGS LIKE THAT GOING UP SOME PRIMARY CARE. LET ME HAVING MORE PROVIDERS THEIR TO SEE FOLKS AT THE FRONT END WILL REALLY HELP US IMPROVE OUR HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. SO YEAH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS I THINK TO SAY IT'S GOING TO FAST IS A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS AND THIS IS JUST THE FIRST HOUSE. SO THEY'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GETS TO THE TABLE AS WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. PROVIDING QUALITY CARE AND ACCESS TO CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN MISTER VOEPEL. YOUR RECOGNIZE. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS SO I CAUTION ON THIS BILL I DO NOT SUPPORT IT RIGHT NOW IT NEEDS MORE WORK. IT NEEDS TO COME BACK TO US NEXT SESSION HERE'S WHY. I SPENT THIRTY NINE YEARS. AS AN INSURANCE EXPERT AT LEAST I THOUGHT I WAS AN EXPERT FROM THE. DESIGNING HEALTH PLANS FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS. AND HERE'S THE DEAL ON THIS ONE. NURSE PRACTITIONERS. OUR NOBLE IN GREAT BUT THERE ARE ALSO A WAY OF SAVING MONEY FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS AND OTHER HEALTH PLANS IF YOU FINAL PEOPLE OFF TO NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND AVOID. PHYSICIANS WHO ARE IN CHARGE THEN THAT IS A COST SAVER IT IS ALSO PROVIDING INADEQUATE SERVICE IN SOME CASES SO I CAUTION THIS BODY IN VOTING FOR THIS BILL RIGHT NOW I MAY SUPPORT IN THE FUTURE BUT IT NEEDS WORK. BECAUSE THIS BY AN OUTLET. FOR LOWERING QUALITY OF CARE IN SAVING MONEY FOR VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT WE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISS VOEPEL MINS PETRIE-NORRIS HEARING. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT AS AB EIGHT NINETY I THINK THAT THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS POLICY ARE REALLY QUITE COMPELLING I'M AS I'VE SHARED WITH THE AUTHOR I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT AS THE CREATION OF THE NEW BOARD IN THE STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT AS SPECIFIED IN THE BALLOT. AND HER SHE FRIENDS AS THEY OPENED TO WORK WITH THAT TO REFINE NOT AS SAD AS THIS BILL MOVES TOWARD BUT TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND WERE TO WORKING WITH AN ATTITUDE. IT TO HELP. MR JOHNSON YOU'RE RECOGNIZE THANK YOU SPEAKER I RISE TO SPEAK ON A EIGHT NINETY I WILL BE SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY TO HELP THIS BILL MOVE FOR I DO HAVE CONCERN THAT I WILL TO SEE ADDRESSED AT THE BILL MOVES FOR TO PROCESS MY COMMUNITY IS CURRENTLY IN UNDER OF COMMUNITY MEDICALLY AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL GIVE IT A CHANCE. TO HAVE SOME HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. THIS BILL DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS WILL BE SERVING MY DISTRICT OR EVEN ROLE DISTRICT BECAUSE IT LACKS A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY DO A MINIMUM TIME OF SERVICE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. I AM ALSO CONCERNED AT THIS MAY LEAD TO A DIVIDED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHERE THOSE THAT CAN AFFORD IT. GO TO THE DOCTOR BY THOSE THAT CANNOT AFFORD IT GO TO NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT UTILIZED MEDI CAL. AT A HIGH RATE ESPECIALLY UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH A SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER SERVED BY PHYSICIANS. AND I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THAT NOT IF THAT WHEN THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. WE DON'T FORGET TO KEEP WORKING ON WAYS TO GET. MORE PHYSICIANS AND DISTRICTS THAT LOOK LIKE MINE WE NEED MORE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PERIOD. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR MY CONSTITUENTS IN THE STATUS QUO. THIS BILL DOES. NOT SOLVE ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE ACCESS PROBLEMS STILL NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE FLESHED OUT. I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY BUT IS A RESERVE MY RIGHT TO CHANGE MY VOTE WHEN HIS BILL RETURNS TO THE FLOOR. MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM. THEY WERE CHAU SORRY DOCTOR QUIRK YES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT NINETY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT.

WITH A LESSER RESTRICTIVE BILL I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS MENTION PROCESS. THE I. BUT WE MIGHT WE MIGHT WHEN ASKED PRACTITIONERS TO GARY THEY WOULD SERVE AN UNDERSERVED AREA- OFFERS. AS A PERIOD TIME I WOULD SAY THEN IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO FORCE PEOPLE TO GUARANTEE THEM TO BEGIN THAT WERE ALL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND NOT JUST THERE'S PRACTITIONERS. AND THAT MIGHT NOT TASTE SO GOOD. PEOPLE BUT THE REALITY IS WE NEED TO GET CARE TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. SOME OF SAID THIS WILL PROVIDE TWO TIERS OF CARE. I SAY IT IT IT ALREADY WE ALREADY HAVE TWO TIERS OF CARE. PEOPLE GET CARE. IF PEOPLE DON'T CARE MY GOAL IS. TO GET MORE CARE TO MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO A EMERGENCY ROOM. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO STRESS OUT OUR SYSTEM DON'T HAVE THE COSTA SIS MORE.
