AS A FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE L. A. O. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RAIN QUIST DR RYAN QUIST- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALSO SECRETARY TREASURER COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION KIM LEWIS A MANAGING ATTORNEY FOR NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. CHRIS STONE EMERGENCE- LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES CONNIE PICASSO MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST SANTA CLARA COUNTY BEHAVIORAL DEPARTMENT- IT SKEWS ME SANTA CLARA COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND A MEMBER OF SEIU LOCAL FIVE TWO ONE. SO HERE WE GO NOW YOUR. RUNS J. C. RIGHT YOU SO MUCH. OF THIS. REGARDING THIS THIS FIRST AT. ON YOUR MEDICAL THIS HOW LONG BEEN DEFINE IN AND HEALTH CARE- AND BEHAVE HEALTH- DOM. AS HEALTHCARE SERVICES NEEDED TO PREVENT. DIAGNOSE TREAT AN ILLNESS INJURY CONDITION DISEASE. OR ITS SYMPTOMS- AND THAT NEEDS- ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS OF MEDICINE AS DEFINED BY OUR VARIOUS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS- IN ANY OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR CONDITION PRODUCES DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS OR SIDE EFFECTS. AND IT'S ALSO CONSIDERED MEDICALLY NECESSARY TO TREAT THOSE. HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA MEDIC HOUSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS LONG- MISUSE THE TERM MEDICAL NECESSITY I THINK WE'VE BEEN UNCOVERING THE THROUGH THE KALLIKRATIS SAYS QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY- AND INSTEAD IT TENDS TO USE THE TERM TO DEFINE THE BENEFIT OR SCOPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COUNTIES. ARE WHO DO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH FIRST IS THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDE NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH OR MILD TO MODERATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FROM THIS ALSO OFTEN IS AT ODDS WITH THE WAY WE USE THE TERM ELSEWHERE AND HEALTH CARE AND CAN BE DEFINED IN THE STATE PLAN PROVIDER MAY EUROPE- OTHER DH CS GUIDANCE- AS DONE THROUGH THE PHYSICAL HEALTH BENEFITS- THIS HAS CREATED A LOT OF CONFUSING- CONFUSION SORRY. AND MISINTERPRETATION OVER THE YEARS OFTEN LEADING TO RESTRICTED ACCESS- BUT ALSO TO DIS ALLOWANCES OF CLAIMS FOR SPECIAL THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES I'M THAT WERE OFTENTIMES NOT FOUNDED BASED ON- THE SERVICES AS BEING NEEDED FOR THAT BENEFICIARY- A FEW EXAMPLES- TO JUST NOTE. ON THE LIST OF DIAGNOSES AND STATE REGULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE ARE OUTDATED THEY DON'T DEFINE MEDICAL NECESSITY IN A WAY THAT **** IN SHAPE OR FORM- THEY DON'T ALSO UP APPROPRIATELY DEFINE AND DIVIDE THE SYSTEM OF RESPONSIBILITY AS MANY OF THE DIAGNOSES LISTED- CAN CURRENTLY AND- ARE CURRENTLY AND SHOULD BE SERVED IN BOTH OF DELIVERY SYSTEMS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT A PROVIDER SHOULD BE ABLE TO BILL FOR SERVICES OUT WHILE DETERMINING A DIAGNOSIS ASDONE IN PHYSICAL HEALTH AND WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH CMS AROUND THIS VERY SPECIFIC ITEM HOWEVER HISTORICAL BARRIERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE PREVENTED SOME OF THESE TYPES OF PRACTICES. OF FROM PEOPLE BEING ABLE. TO ACCESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. HE BELIEVES WE- BE MORE FOCUSED BUT- THE IS A- FOR PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES- AND WHAT SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED BASED ON CLINICAL DETERMINATION- SUCH AS SERVICES THAT ARE MEDICALLY NECESSARY AS I OUTLINED AT THE BEGINNING. I'M SO THE KEY CHANGES THAT WE ARE PROPOSING WITHOUT IN CALAIS ARE CLEAR FIND THE DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH ENSURING ACCESS FOR CHILDREN WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF TRAUMA HOMELESSNESS. AND THOSE IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. CLEAR FIND EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT FOR WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE PSTG SERVICES AND EXPECTATIONS. ESPECIALLY WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. ENSURING BENEFICIARIES CAN ACCESS TREATMENT SERVICES WHILE THEY ARE BEING ASSESSED FOR A DIAGNOSIS IN BOTH SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. IMPLEMENTING STANDARDIZED SCREENING IN TRANSITION TOOLS TO ENSURE BENEFICIARIES GET THE NEEDED CARE QUICKLY AND RELIABLY. IMPLEMENTING A NO WRONG DOOR IN TREATMENT OF CO OCCURRING DISORDERS AS OFTEN EXISTS ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE AND SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND ALLOWED WITH IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPACES BOB. WE ALSO HAVE SOME IMPROVE IN THE- DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM OR WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MC OF YES- AS WELL AS STREAMLINING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS TO ALIGN WITH MEDICAL CARE I'M IN REDUCING THE HEAVY BURDEN THAT WE HAVE PLACED ON BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA. I DH CS HAD ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS EASIER- TO BET MANY OF THESE MAJOR POLICY DECISIONS- INCLUDING MEDICAL NECESSITY- AND THAT IS WHAT IS ULTIMATELY WITHIN THE UPDATED CALLIE IN PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU- A FEW NOTES A GIVEN THE INITIAL CALLIN TRAILER BILL WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN JULY OF TWENTY ONE- WHEN DH CS IN CMS ARE STILL NEGOTIATING. THE WAIVERS AND VARIOUS STATE PLAN AMENDMENTS AS NECESSARY THE ACS BELIEVES IT NEEDS ARE SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR CALLIN DETAILS AND LIMITATIONS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE COMING MONTHS. ARE THERE% FOR THE TRAILER BILL ALLOWS DH CS TO PROPOSE CAL IN POLICIES AND PER- PROPOSALS TO CMS AND WEBER STATE PLAN AMENDMENTS CONTRACT CHANGES INTO PUBLISHED GUIDANCE THROUGH I'M INFORMATION NOTICES TO ALLOW FOR EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION. THAT SAID DH CS RECOGNIZES THE LEDGES STRUCTURES OF SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN SETTING POLICY FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AS A RESULT THE H. C. A. R. AT DCS PRIORITIZED ESTABLISHING THE GENERAL STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR CALLIN- AND LEGISLATING THE PRINCIPLE CONCEPTS AND GOALS IN THE TRAILER BILL. THAT WOULD GUIDE DH CS NEGOTIATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION IN ADDITION ARE THE CALENDAR THE BILL CONTEMPLATES ONGOING AND EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION INCLUDING OF COURSE WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WOULD INFORM THE EVENTUAL POLICY DETAILS IN IMPLEMENTATION. D. H. YES IS VERY OPEN TO SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION TO CODIFY THOSE DETAILS POST APPROVAL ABBY AS WE HAVE DONE IN MANY WAIVERS PRIOR TO THIS- IN FOR EXAMPLE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH INSURING. EVSC T. PROTECTIONS FOR TO ALL ARE IN STATE LAW IN THIS. OUR ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING AND MOVE ON TO- KOREA. WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS AT LAST WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AFTER EACH PANEL SO. THANK YOU AN THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT A KOREAN SHEET WITH THE L. A. L. TO START OFF WE JUST WANNA MAKES AN OVER ARCHING COMMENT THAT RELATES TO THE ISSUE ON THIS PANEL BUT ALSO SOME OF THE OTHER CALLIN PROPOSALS THAT ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSED LATER ON IN THE IN THE HEARING. AND WHICH ARE RAISED IN IN THE AGENDA- FOR THE HEARING AS WELL- WE WANT TO SORT OF ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WILLINGNESS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION JUST EXPRESSED IN IN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE- IN DEVELOPING DETAILS RELATED TO THE KILLING PROPOSAL. HOWEVER THAT THE AND THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR CALAMP INCLUDING SEVERAL BEHAVIORAL CHANGES DELEGATES THE ABILITY TO SHAPE DETAILS ON THESE PROPOSALS TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE- AND SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO HAVE MORE OF A ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROPOSALS- FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING MORE INPUT ON SPECIFIC CHANGES TO- MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA IT MAY WISH TO EXPLORE REFINEMENTS TO THE- PROPOSED TRAILER BILL TO ENSURE THAT IT HAS MORE IN PLACE SORT OF IN THE- IN THE PROCESS- SPEAK. TO MEDICAL. SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT THAT CURRENTLY THE DETERMINATION PROCESS- FOR WHICH DELIVERY SYSTEM A BENEFICIARY SHOULD ACCESS SERVICES FROM YOU KNOW THE AT MANAGED CARE OR THE COUNTY. ON CAN BE SORT OF CARRIED OUT AND CONSISTENTLY- WHICH YOU KNOW COULD RESULT IN BENEFICIARIES- BEING UNABLE TO ACCESS NEEDED SERVICES ON TIME YOU KNOW THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR BENEFICIARIES UNDER AGE TWENTY ONE GIVEN THAT THE CRITERIA FOR ACCESSING SERVICES FROM THE COUNTY FOR YOUTH ARE- DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE FOR ADULTS- ADOPTING STANDARDIZED. SCREENING AND TRANSITIONS TOOLS FOR COUNTIES IN MANAGED CARE PLANS AS PROPOSED UNDER THE MEDICAL NECESSITY REFORMS COULD COULD HELP SORT OF MAKE THIS PROCESS MORE MORE CONSISTENT- HOWEVER IN PRACTICE THERE'S STILL IS GOING TO NEED TO BE SIGNIFICANT COORDINATION BETWEEN. COUNTIES IN MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THESE TOOLS RESULT IN MORE CONSISTENCY OF CARE FOR BENEFICIARIES- THE PROPOSED REVISIONS TO MEDICAL NECESSITY ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO. IMPROVE ACCESS TO BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES OFFERED- BECAUSE BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE ABLE TO- RECEIVE SERVICES EARLIER FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY DIDN'T- HAVE A DIAGNOSIS YET- AND YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT COUNTIES WOULD HAVE SORT OF ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING- FOR EXAMPLE BY HAVING FEWER OF THEIR CLAIMS FOR. BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES DISALLOWED DUE TO YOU KNOW ADMINISTRATIVE HURDLES- AND ACCESSING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING COULD HELP FREE UP COUNTY FUNDS TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN. EXPANDING BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT CAPACITY- REGARDING THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT A COUPLE OF IMPACTS THAT GO IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ARE ARE POSSIBLE- WHICH ON NET MAKES YOU KNOW THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FISCAL IMPACT ON CERTAIN- IF THESE REVISIONS RESULT IN INCREASED UTILIZATION OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES- THEY WOULD INCREASE COUNTY COSTS AND POTENTIALLY STATE COSTS FOR THOSE BENEFICIARIES. IN THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT THE STATE PROVIDES THE NON FEDERAL SHARE OF COSTS FOR. HOWEVER IF THEY RESULT IN COUNTY'S ACCESSING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SERVICES THAT ARE ALREADY BEING PROVIDED- WHICH WE HAVE HEARD MAY BE THE CASE- THEY WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS WHICH WOULD. IN TURN FREE UP FUNDING TO SORT OF EXPAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT CAPACITY- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW THE NO WRONG DOOR POLICY UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL TO. ALLOW FOR BENEFICIARIES TO- RECEIVE SERVICES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT- EVEN IF THEY ULTIMATELY GET REFERRED TO THE OTHER SORT OF DELIVERY SYSTEM BE IT WHETHER IT BE IN MANAGED CARE IN THE COUNTY- YOU KNOW COULD INCREASE GENERAL FUND COSTS IF IT RESULTS IN- MORE BENEFICIARIES ACCESSING SERVICES FROM THEIR MANAGED CARE PLAN FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S- THAT'S ALL THE COMMENTS THAT THE L. A. O. HAS- FOR THIS PANEL HAPPY HAPPY TO PROVIDE FURTHER. ASSISTANCE WHERE. NEEDED THANK YOU FOR MUCH- SO. ASSUME AT THAT POINT THAT MARK NEWTON DOESN'T ANY COMMENTS OR WE PUT YOUR COMMENTS TOGETHER FOR THIS PANEL. THAT'S CORRECT I'LL BE SPEAKING VALLEY OFFICER SHE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO A RYAN QUESTS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON SKEWS ME BUT AFTER INSURANCE WORK ORDER AND ARAMBULA MY NAME IS DR REHNQUIST I AM THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND I'LL BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BURKE. HE BROUGHT HEALTH RECORDS TODAY. OVERALL THE STATE'S KELLERMAN ISSUE GIVE OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LARGE LARGE SCALE REFORM THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE OUT. THE COUNTIES ARE GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PUTTING FORWARD THAT PROPOSALS WE WILL DISCUSS WITH YOU TODAY. THESE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS INTERESTED IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY ACCESSIBILITY AND EQUITY OF OUR SPECIALLY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING C. DHEA AND ITS MEMBERS. CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAWS RELATING TO MEDICAL NECESSITY DETERMINATIONS FOR SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH IN A CD SERVICES WERE STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT IT WAS THAT. THAT WAS UNNECESSARILY RESTRICTIVE IN OVERTIME THIS IS RESULTING IN SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE KILLINGS SEEKS TO REMEDY. HEBER HEALTH PROVIDERS SPEND UP PAPERWORK TO JUSTIFY BILLING THE FEDERAL MEDICAID FUNDS AND THAT'S TIME THAT COULD BE SPENT PROVIDING CARE- BEHAVIOR HEALTH DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS ARE GREATER BURDEN THAN IN OTHER. PARTS OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND TO A LARGE EXTENT EITHER SELF IMPOSED CALIFORNIA BURNS RAN INTO OUR REGULATIONS THAT WE END UP HAVING TO AUDIT TO. WHEN WE END UP HAVING TO ADD IT TO THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE IN OUR REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THE CURRENT SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA HOW BAD TO FEDERAL AND STATE AUDIT DENIALS. OF LEGITIMATE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IS SPECIALNEEDS LEGITIMATE SERVICES WERE DENIED BECAUSE THE DOCUMENTATION. DIDN'T MAKE THE TECHNICAL. THAT ISN'T QUITE TECHNICALLY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. OVER TIME- COUNTY SEVEN TRAINS THROUGH AUDIT DISALLOWANCE IS TO EITHER DISCONTINUE CERTAIN SERVICES OR USE NON MEDICAID FUNDS TO FILL IN THE GAPS FOR SERVICES TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHICH IN FACT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BILLABLE WITH THE FEDERAL MATCH LEAVING FEDERAL DOLLARS ON THE TABLE AND OF COURSE WE THINK WE SHOULD BE BRINGING AS MUCH FEDERAL REVENUE AND WHERE STATE INCOMES AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS ALSO MASKED THE ACTUAL SERVICE LEVELS PROVIDED BY COUNTIES TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES PARTICULARLY AMONG CHILDREN WHICH IS CONCERNING FROM A PUBLIC POLICY AND- ACCOUNTABILITY PERSPECTIVE. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH OF OUR PAYMENT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF OUR PAYMENT RULES ARE BUILT INTO A FEDERAL WAIVER. COUNTIES ALSO BEAR SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY FOR FEDERAL AND STATE FINANCIAL AUDITS AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DOCUMENTATION. MOST RECENTLY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDITED THE CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING DISALLOWED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CLAIMS MAINLY ON THE BASIS THAT MEDICAL NECESSITY HAD NOT BEEN. DOCUMENTED TO THE EXACTING STANDARD. STANDARDS OF THIS OF THE SELF IMPOSED REQUIREMENTS. THIS LEVEL OF FINANCIAL RISK HAS UNFORTUNATELY MEANT THAT COUNTIES TO THE MINISTER OUR SERVICES WITH IN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION. FOR WHICH SERVICES WE BELIEVE MAY BE PLAYABLE AND THOSE COUNTIES WITH MULTIPLE OR REPEATED STATE AND FEDERAL DIS ALLOWANCES WILL OFTEN SELF DISALLOW CLAIMS FROM PROVIDERS SIMPLY TO AVOID THE RISK. THIS PROCESS DOES NOT HELP TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND OUTCOMES INSTEAD SEARCHED ORIENT ARE STAFFED WORDS COMPLAINTS. RATHER THAN. FOCUSING ON CLIENTS. LOWERS MORALE AND CAUSE TALENTED STAFF TO LEAVE OUR RATES THE FOCUS SHOULD BE MORE ON THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDING CARE RATHER THAN ON PAPERWORK- FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S AN OVER RELIANCE ON THE DIAGNOSIS IS A KEY ELEMENT OF REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. SO THE INITIAL FOCUS WITH OUR CLIENTS HIS BANNED LINE DOING A LENGTHY THOROUGH ASSESSMENT UP FRONT WHICH FRANKLY CAN SERVE AS A BARRIER TO CARE ESPECIALLY WHEN PROVIDERS AT TIMES HAVE A NARROW WINDOW IN WHICH TO ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS. INTO OUR SERVICES. WHEN SOMEONE SEEKING HELP THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY WANTING TO TELL THEIR WHOLE LIFE STORY TO A STRANGER THEY WANT SOMEONE TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR WITH THEIR DISTRESSED SO THIS CREATES A BARRIER TO DEVELOPING A RELATIONSHIP. THANK THIS IS WILL BE CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT COMPONENT BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BILL FOR OTHER SERVICES PRIOR TO THE DIAGNOSIS. OUR HOPE IS THAT BEHAVIOR HELP DOCUMENTATION TO SPEECH AND SHIFT TO A FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM LIST. JUST LIKE OTHER PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO. WOULD LIKE A PROVIDERS SHOULD BE ABLE FOCUS ON SERVICE DELIVERY AND PROVIDING THE SERVICES NEEDED. WHEN WHERE AND HOW IT'S CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. RATHER THAN RESTRICTED BY PROVIDERS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT ADDRESSED. BUT EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- CLINICIANS FELT THE NEED TO PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS FOR A CHILD RAN COUNTER TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CHILDREN'S UNIQUE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. EPISD CHEATING TYLER. NOW IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN CAN REALLY ACCESSIBLE RANGE OF SPECIALTY MEDICAL. RESCUE SERVICES IN THE RAPTURE OR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL. WE BELIEVE THAT IN DOING SO THESE CHANGES WERE WILL BETTER ALIGN WITH. PTSD T. BENEFIT. CAN YOU BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF ALL PARTNER WITH RISKY TO DEEPEN OUR COMMITMENT OPEN POLICY DISCUSSION MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS UNIQUE. ALL CHILD WELL INVOLVED SHOW THE CHILDREN EXTRA HOMELESSNESS WE BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE EXISTING STRONG PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES AND INHERENTLY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE REMOVAL FROM THE WHOLE. IN ADDITION TO EXPERIENCES OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT WE NEED TO ENSURE OF LOCAL ARE GOING TO BE HERE HEALTH CASE MANAGEMENT AND A FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES TO PREVENT IN A MILITARY. MENTAL HEALTH AND ASKING S. U. D. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POSTTRAUMATIC WORKS. FINALLY THE STATE IN COORDINATION WITH COUNTIES IN MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL DEVELOP A SET OF STANDARD A SCREENING IN TRANSITION TOWARDS. WHICH WE EXPECT TO ENSURE GREATER CONSISTENCY IN OUR INAPPROPRIATELY SCREEN BENEFICIARIES INTO BETWEEN SPECIALTY AND NON SPECIALTY SERVICES. IN KEEPING WITH THESE GOALS AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO DEVELOP RESPONSE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WE WOULD ASK THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO WORK WITH NO MEANS TO SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED EXISTING DOCUMENTATION. REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSESSMENT. EVEN PLAN AND- NOTES. FROM SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH AND DRUG MEDI CAL OR TO SAYS IN OUR TO IMPROVE OFFICIATE. THE H. D. IS GREAT TO THE GOALS OF COUNTING WHICH INCLUDED PHILOSOPHICAL LEARN PRACTICE SHIFT AWAY FROM FINANCIAL DISALLOWANCE IS FOR MINOR CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION CONCERNS AND MOVE TOWARDS TRUE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT CONSISTENT CONSISTENT WITH A BROADER MEDICAL PROGRAM APPROACH. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR QUIST- MOVING ON TO KIM LEWIS. GOOD AFTERNOON HI THIS IS KIM LEWIS FROM THE NATIONAL FLOOD PROGRAM CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES THANK YOU HI I HAVE SOME SLIDES AND I'M HOPING SOMEONE WILL PUT UP BUT- LET ME KNOW. RIGHT COTTOM. PERFECT THANK YOU- AS I SAID I'M CAN LIFT THE NATIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM AND IT'S MY PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IMPROVING THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND MEDICARE SPECIFICALLY I'M GONNA FOCUS MY COMMENTS TODAY ON THE DEPARTMENT'S CAL IMPROPRIETIES ON BEHAVIOR HEALTH MEDICAL NECESSITY AND RELATED CHANGES AS WELL AS- THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL TO AMEND THE STATE LINE ACHIEVED. A PROPOSAL- NEXT LIVE. JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I AM THIS OUR OFFICES- HAS WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE- TO PROTECT AND ADVANCE THE RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS AND HEALTH CARE AREA- WE ADVOCATE TO EDUCATE LITIGATE THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS TO ADVANCE HEALTH CARE RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE THREE OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA WASHINGTON DC AND NORTH CAROLINA. NEXT SLIDE. I WANT TO TALK JUST FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PST T. AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED BY J. C. AND OTHERS- WE TALK ABOUT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE HAVE TO KEEP FRONT CENTER THE MEDICAID ENTITLEMENT FOR CHILDREN YOUTH UNDER AGE TWENTY ONE THE EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT SERVICES. THE STATE'S REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PST T. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THIS IS A ROBUST BENEFIT ON THE MEDICAID BENEFITS BROADER THE MEDICAID BENEFITS FOR ADULTS AND IT'S DESIGNED TO ASSURE. THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE EARLY DETECTION AND CARE SO THAT HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE BURDENS ARE IDENTIFIED EARLY AND TREATED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. YC P. STT CRITICAL TO THE GOALS. ARE THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT. INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN AND YOU CAN GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT IN OTHER WORDS THE RIGHT CARE THE RIGHT TIME. FOR THE- IN THE RIGHT SETTING. THANKS LINE. IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A PST T. AND I THINK JC ALLUDED TO THIS IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE MEDICAL NECESSITY IS BUILT INTO THE FEDERAL LAW SO THERE ARE THE REQUIREMENT THAT CHILDREN UNDER TWENTY ONE IN THE STATUTE ARE ENTITLED TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE THAT IS NECESSARY CARE DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES TREATMENT AND OTHER MEASURES TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE. WHAT THE WHAT IT SAYS IS DEFECTS AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ILLNESSES AND CONDITIONS AND THOSE AREN'T ANY DISCOVERED BY SCREENING- ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SERVICES ARE ALREADY COVERED IN THE STATE PLAN. THE NEXT SLIDE. IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY THEIR HUSBAND LEGISLATION PASSED IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I SPECIFICALLY SB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH CODIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS IN STATE LAW THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT AND MAKE SPECIFIC THESE PROVISIONS BY ALL COUNTY-LETTER SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS UNTIL THERE ARE NEW REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED. ON THOSE REGULATIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ADOPTED BY JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THOSE UPDATED REGULATIONS ARE REALLY NECESSARY TO REMEDY THE CONFUSION OUTDATED STATE REGULATIONS THAT EXIST TODAY. THAT LEGISLATION ALSO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT ITS CONTRACTORS TO UPDATE EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE DOCUMENT HANDBOOKS AND NECESSARY MATERIALS TO ENSURE THAT THE MEDICAL NECESSITY STANDARD THAT'S NOW IN- EMBEDDED IN THE STATE LAW TO COMPLY WITH THAT FEDERALLY PST T. STANDARD. IS ACTUALLY REFLECTED IN ALL OF THESE MATERIALS. NEXT SLIDE. SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT CALLING HIM SPECIFICALLY AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT WHAT'S IN IT WE CERTAINLY FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY STRONG SUPPORT THE IMPORTANT GOAL THE CALENDAR OF THE KALYAN CHANGES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY MENTAL SERVICES FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS INCLUDING WHERE THERE'S A CO OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER THIS BILL SPECIFIC IMPORTANT PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS THAT SOME ABILITY TO INCLUDE REQUIRING STANDARDIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM SCREENING TOOL TO BE USED BY MANAGED CARE PLANS IN MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. TO DETERMINE WHICH DELIVERY SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE TO SERVE THE BENEFICIARY ALSO IMPLEMENTING A NO WRONG DOOR POLICY TO ENSURE BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES INCLUDING SCREENING ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT REGARDLESS OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM WHERE THE SEA CARE. ELIMINATING A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A DIAGNOSIS TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR A MENTAL ILLNESS OR CONDITION INCLUDING SPECIALTY MENTAL SERVICES. WELL THIS IS TRUE TODAY IT'S NOT CLEAR AND SOME IN SOME CASES A TIME LIMITED REQUIREMENTS. STREAMLINING MENTAL HEALTH DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY PLANS IN COUNTY'S AGAIN THERE NEEDS TO BE STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY ON THIS AND I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE GOAL OF KILLING. AND THEN CLARIFYING THAT CHILDREN AND YOUTH UNDER AGE TWENTY ONE CAN GET SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REGARDLESS OF THE IMPAIRMENT LEVEL. THIS IS BEEN A LONG STANDING CONCERN OF OURS THAT HIS IMPAIRMENT LEVELS HAVE BEEN MISAPPLIED TO LIMIT ACCESS TO CERTAIN SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHERE WE BELIEVE MEDICAL NECESSITY SHOULD BE THE ONLY STANDARD OR CRITERIA TO GET THOSE SERVICES. AND THEN FINALLY OPENING ACCESS TO SPECIALTY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH EXPERIENCING TRAUMA. AS EVIDENCED BY ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND THOSE IDENTIFIED THROUGH TRAUMA SCREENING IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE ALL KNOW TRUMP HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OF MENTAL HEALTH. AND ACES ARE OFTEN FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCED BY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. NEXT TIME. WELL IN TERMS OF PLAN RESPONSIBILITY- THE CALUMET ICAL ASSESS CITY NEEDS SOME CLARIFICATION. SO THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR PLAN RESPONSIBILITY AROUND- WHO IS RESPONSIBLE PROVIDE MENTAL SERVICES YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS WRONG NO WRONG DOOR- BUT BUILT INTO THIS PROPOSAL BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR CAN BENEFIT YOU SIMPLY CHOOSE WHICH STORE THEY WANT TO GO TO A CAN THEY GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF BENEFIT OR THE SAME TYPES OF SERVICES. AND THEN CHILDREN IN USE EXPANDING ACCESS TO MENTAL ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES CAN BE SELECTIVE SO WHAT IS THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AGAIN RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THESE CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO MAKE MOUNT DIRECTLY TO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. SECONDLY THE ONGOING ACCESS IS STILL AN ISSUE FOR US- WE KNOW THAT UPS CITY COMPLIANCE IS REALLY STILL IS A MAJOR CONCERN. AND THAT THE PENETRATION RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE VERY LOW FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS CAN GET ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. NOT JUST IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM OR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS BUT ALSO JUVENILE JUSTICE KIDS KIDS AT RISK. OF COMING INTO THOSE SYSTEMS. SO WHAT OF THE CAPACITIES OF THE SYSTEM HAS CURRENTLY TO MEET THOSE ONGOING NEEDS AND WHEN WE'RE EXPANDING. THIS ACCESS HOW IS THAT ACTORS SPEND ASSETS TAXES GOING TO BE MET. AND THEN THE CLINICAL GUIDANCE THERE'S NO APPROPRIATE- SORT OF GUIDANCE BILL. EXISTS OR SHOWS UP WHAT OF THE CLINICAL GUIDELINES WILL BE USER STANDARDS I. NEXT SLIDE SO JUST A FEW COMMENTS ON THE TRAILER BILL ITSELF- WE DO NOT SUPPORT- HAVING TAKING THE MEDICAL NECESSITY OUT OF THE STATE STATUTE WE FOUGHT HARD TO GET THOSE CHANGES IN AND THE EFFORTS TO NOT CHANGE THAT LEGISLATION AND PUT THAT CONTROL DIRECTLY IN THE HANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT ONE THAT WE THINK IS THE BEST PRACTICE OR OR PROPRIOCEPTION TO TAKE- IS CERTAINLY THE LANGUAGE IN. ALSO IN CAL AND THAT SAYS THIS CAN BE CHANGED BASED ON YOU KNOW ALL MEDICAL NECESSITY DETERMINATIONS SCREENINGS AND ASSESSMENTS AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. ARE GOING TO BE SIMPLY DECIDED THROUGH TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A WAIVER WHICH HAPPENS TO BE. THOSE THOSE CONDITIONS A HAPPEN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN CMS AND THE DEPARTMENT AND WE DON'T THINK THAT. THAT IS ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY AND WE THINK THAT THESE REALLY ARE ARE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE EMBEDDED IN THE STATUTES ITSELF. ON NEXT LIVE TO OUR FINALLY A WRECK. SPECIFIC TO THIS AREA. IS THAT WE THINK WE SHOULD MAINTAIN THE MEDICAL NECESSITY DEFINITIONS IN THE STATUTE AS REQUIRED. DESCRIBE THE CALLIN CHANGES THAT CHASE YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AS DELIVERY SYSTEM CRITERIA NOT AS MEDICAL NECESSITY BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN MEETING MEDICAL NECESSITY. CLARIFY THAT THE PSTG OBLIGATIONS APPLY TO SCREENING ASSESSMENT MEDICAL NECESSITY. AS TODAY. CLARIFY THAT NO ROCK WHAT ARE THOSE NO WRONG DOOR REQUIREMENTS IN STATE LAW SO HOW WILL WE KNOW WHICH IS WHICH SYSTEM SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GO TO WHEN WILL THEY NOW WAIT WHAT THAT SYSTEM IS. AND THEN CLARIFYING AGAIN THAT THE DIAGNOSIS SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE IN THE STATUTE THAT IS NOT REQUIRED BY EITHER MANAGED CARE PLANS MEDICAL PLANS OR FEE FOR SERVICE. AND THEN CLARIFYING THAT EXPERIENCING TRAUMA IS A CONDITION THAT QUALIFIES THE CHILD USED TO RECEIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE ALREADY INVOLVED IN CHILD WELFARE. OR EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN FINALLY CLARIFYING THAT ROLE OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO EXPLODE WE'RE EXPANDING MANTA CAL- SERVICES BEHAVIOR HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM SERVICES AND THE MANAGED CARE PLANS STILL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THIS POPULATION. WELL I HAVE SOME RESOURCES I'VE ALSO PROVIDED AND HAPPEN TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO CHRIS STONER MERTZ PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON TEARS ARAMBULA AND WOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US TODAY I'M CHRIS STONER MERTZ THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE. WITH CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. REPRESENTING HUNDRED FIFTY NATIONALLY ACCREDITED ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES TO CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH MANY OF THE POINTS THAT MS LEWIS HAS MAINTAINED ALL TRY TO HER COME. TO BRING SOME. TO HOW THE TRAILER BILL LANG IN FACT THAT. PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICE TO FUND. WHAT IS IT REALLY TO BETTER SO. WASTE SUPPORT THE WORK THAT DH. IN THE COUNTY WORK CREW. HAVE DONE A WORKING ENSURE THAT MATTER THIS CRITERIA. FEDERAL ASPEN TO MAN. FOR CHILDREN YOUTH I THINK WE ALL THE HAPPY. IN OUR CAL WORK BIRDS ACTUALLY- TO SEE THAT- LEADERSHIP. ROLES WERE PARTICULAR PLEASED WITH THE EMPHASIS ON RECORD AND MUST ADDRESS CHILDREN MENTAL AND SO. USE AND ONLY. ARE EVEN BEFORE THERE IS. DIAGNOSE IN A RECORD THAT EXPOSE. JUST TRY. IS A CAN. THAT SHOULD ACT TO BE MIRACLE SERVICES. SO THAT THERE'S NO DISCREPANCY IN DEFINITION FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR- GREAT. IT WOULD SIMILAR SIMILARLY RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT ANY AMENDMENTS OUTLINED TO BE OUT TO WORK. FOURTEEN FIVE A NINE POINT FIVE THE FORWARD THAT SEEK TO A ROAD REQUIREMENTS INTENSE HEAT FOUR EIGHTY SEVEN THAT WAS A LONG. IN TERMS OF THE ROCK NO WRONG DOOR APPROACH- AGAIN. WE BOUGHT THE YOU DEPARTMENTS WORK ON THIS- AND WE THINK THAT THAT REALLY HELPS IT WILL HELP TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES WHICH MOBILE REFORMS. WE SIMILARLY AGREE FOR THE FAT CARE ACT CRITERIA SHOULD BE OUTLINED IN STATE LAW. FROM WE ALSO THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THE INTENT OF NO WRONGDOING PROVES VERY POSITIVE REALITY IS THAT THE- THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT. PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO CHILDREN WITH LONG FOR EXAMPLE MANAGED CARE PLANS FIVE THAT CAN BE USED TO BILL FOR SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. WHILE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. HAVE THIRTEEN OR MORE. THIS IS REFLECTED OF THE DIFF IN ACCESS SERVICE. TWENTY DELIVERY SYSTEM SETTINGS. WHAT MADE IT EASY ON PAPER TO TRANSITION BENEFICIARY FROM WHEN WE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER REALITY IS THAT THIS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT OPPONENTS ON THE GROUND. THERE ALSO EXISTS LIMITS. REGARDING WHERE SERVICES MAY BE PROVIDED TO YOU. WITH SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THESE ARE OFTEN LIMITED. FOR YOUTH RECEIVING SERVICES M. C. P.'S WE SEE THIS AS AN ACCESS ISSUE AND WHILE THERE'S AN EFFORT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE USER ENGAGEMENT IN SCHOOL BASED NONPROFIT THERE CAREER SPOKESWOMAN MEANS THE- AND OTHER SERVICES OUTSIDE OF CLINICS SETTING. AND SEE THINGS. IF WE WANT TO TRULY. NOT ON NO WRONG DOOR ACCESS TO SERVE. PLACE BUSINESS CONSIDERATION. FINALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE SCREENINGS ASSESSMENTS AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ONLINE ALL- WOULD LIKE TO SEEK CLARIFICATION FEDERAL AND PSTG APPLICATION OBLIGATIONS WHY WHEN DETERMINING SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT INDIVIDUAL YOUR WHOLE SERVICES. AND ONE THAT KNOWS OR CAN BE USED TO ROADS. YES THE TEAM AND THE FOR ACCESS TO SERVICES. WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT IS DH CS DEVELOPS THESE TOOLS WERE STAKEHOLDER PROCESSES WITH THE GOAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION AND ACCESS TO CARE BEACH RISING FORCE MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD. TIME AND TIME AGAIN TESTIMONY REGARDING ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS OF AUDIT DISALLOWANCE ISN'T I'M GOING PEOPLE WORK AT THE MAN'S IS MUCH AS A 50% OF PROVIDERS NINE. MR CHRIS SPOKE TO BETTER EARLIER. IN STRONG AGREEMENT WITH IS RECONCILED RECOMMENDATIONS. WE ALSO ENCOURAGE A STATEWIDE APPROACH TO DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS THAT ENSURE SERVICE PROVIDERS WORKING ACROSS COUNTIES IN SYSTEM. STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS. SHE PROPOSING TO STAY. AND STANDARDIZE TO REQUIREMENTS. G. H. C. S. MAS ALSO NOT JUST IT'S AND TO WHAT EXISTS IN STATE LAW OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS BUT THE- CURRENT EXISTING CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WHICH MEANS STATE COUNTIES ARE DIRECTED PROVIDERS. RESULT IN LIMITING ACCESS TO SERVICES RANGE OF HOW MHP LINE. WELL THAT ACCESS TO SERVICES WHAT STAFF ARE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN ATTENTIONAL PROCESSES ALL. NINETY TWO COUNTY- WELL WE KNOW THAT THESE CHANGES WERE MADE TO MOVE THROUGH THE CALENDAR PRESS LAST WEEK URGED G. H. YES MORE LEGISLATORS TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS SUCH AS STANDARDIZING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS THAT CAN BE DONE. RIGHT NOW WE CAN BE WORKING ON THOSE RIGHT NOW OUR CHILDREN USED TO SERVE OUR FULL ATTENTION AT THIS CRITICAL TIME IN THE PROGRAM AND DEMOCRATS. AS THEY CONTINUE TO SUFFER INCREASES IN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE CRISES AND DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATES. HELLO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANELIST ON THIS PANEL- CONNIE PICASSO. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES THANK YOU YES OKAY. SO MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS MY NAME IS COUNTY COUNCIL AND I'M A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST AND SEIU MEMBER ANTHONY CLARKE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. I HAVE FOURTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSESSING SCREENING PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE OR SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND REFERRING TO THE CRITICAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS THE COUNTY. AND I AM HERE TODAY TO SHARE FTA IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED POLICY CHANGE FROM THE DIAGNOSIS SPECIFIC CRITERIA INTO A MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA. THIS POLICY CHANGE WOULD ALLOW US TO MATCH THE REALITY TO THE EXPERIENCE ON THE FIELD WITH THE ACTUAL DIAGNOSIS. AND EVENTUALLY PERMITTED TO TREAT OUR PATIENTS HOLISTICALLY FOR A BROAD RANGE OF NEEDED TO HEAR REAL HEALTH SERVICES. NOW THE CURRENT RULES ARE. DAIRY AND THEY PREVENTED FROM REFERRING OUR PATIENTS TO ALL THE SERVICES THEY NEED BECAUSE THE CURRENT ROLE SIMPLY REVOLVE AROUND WHETHER A DIAGNOSIS IS SPRING REIMBURSABLE OR NOT. SO ESSENTIALLY I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE WITH YOU MY PROFESSIONAL VIEW ON THIS. BECAUSE DAY IN DAY OUT A SCREEN AND REFER CHILDREN YOUTH AND ADULTS FOR URGING PRICE SAYS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR SOMETIMES STANDARD SPECIALTY CARE. AND THE REALITY IS THAT WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY COOLEY NINETEEN AT. SEVENTEEN LEVELS ESPECIALLY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY NOW. THAT APPLIES WITH OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OR MENTAL HEALTH. IN RETURN THE SEEN AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. ALTHOUGH THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT THERE TO SUPPORT IT- BUT WE ARE SAYING THAT ALL THESE EXPERIENCES WITH GRIEF ISOLATION LOSS OF INCOME AND SOMETIMES THE FEAR OF TRIGGERING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS OR EXACERBATING EXISTING ONES IS VERY MUCH THERE. MANY PEOPLE ARE ALSO FACING INCREASED LEVELS OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG USE INSOMNIA PANIC ATTACKS AND SUICIDAL IDEATION. AMONG SOUTH PARK. NOW COUNTY WORKERS ARE SPECIALLY EQUIPPED TO HANDLE COMPLEX CASES MY FEES AND YET WE ARE NOT PROVIDED THE ABILITY TO USE THAT EXPERTISE IN A WAY THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN RECALL TOO MANY INSTANCES WHERE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY HAPPENED TOLD THEY DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THAT THE CABLE HEALTH SERVICES THEY DESPERATELY NEED. AND THESE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALL TOO OFTEN BELONG TO ALREADY HIGHLY PORTABLE SUBGROUPS. WHICH OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. SENIOR CITIZENS SUFFERING PRIMARILY FROM DEMENTIA WITH SECONDARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS SUCH AS DEPRESSION ANXIETY OR PARANOIA. AND ANYONE WITH A SIGNIFICANT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WHICH IS THE PRIMARY IN RELATION TO THEIR THINKING ABOUT HEALTH CONCERNS. SO EVEN THOUGH OUR COUNTY WORKERS LIKE MYSELF HALF THE CLINICAL EXPERTISE TO SCREEN AFTER HER COMMUNITY MEMBERS INTO A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. OUR WORK IS ALL DONE IN VAIN IF COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE ULTIMATELY LOCKED BY INADEQUATE YET IMPERMEABLE REIMBURSEMENT RULES. SO MAKING POLICY CHANGE TO A MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING PAYMENT REFORM AND FOUNDED REIMBURSEMENT POSSIBLE WILL ALLOW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKERS TO ASSESS AND TREAT PATIENTS FOR ALL OF THEIR DISORDERS WITHOUT FEAR OF NOT HAPPY HE MEANT SOURCE. THIS WOULD ALSO OPEN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO FINALLY JAILED UP ARGUE NINETY HERE BILL HEALTHCARE STAFFING AND WORKFORCE. THAT HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED AND I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE THIS EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NOTE THAT WE HAVE- SOME ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE- ANY COMMENTS OR ANYTHING FOR. AND DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR PANELISTS I KNOW I DO BUT- ANY QUESTIONS FROM THIS WALDRON. I'M JUST BRIEFLY- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS IT TO MAYBE- WHOEVER COULD ANSWER IT- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT. THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND- THE COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS AS WELL AS- WE HAD IN THE GROWING NUMBER OF JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS. WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL NEEDS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET. IN THE IN CARCERAL- SITUATIONS- YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES UNLIKE OTHER SOME OTHER COUNTRIES- WHEN PEOPLE GO INSIDE THEY ACTUALLY ARE TAKEN OFF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ON. AND THEN UPON REENTRY THEY HAVE TO BE REALLY- SIGNED UP BACK INTO. YOU KNOW IN OUR CASE MEDIC TELL. WHEREAS IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL TO HAVE A CONTINUITY OF CARE. ESPECIALLY CLOSER TO HOME THE REENTRY TIME- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE. LOOKED AT IN THIS. YOU KNOW THESE RECOMMENDATIONS OF CALLAHAM. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING YOU KNOW A YEAR BEFORE REENTRY OR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS TO GET THE TREATMENT- WITH THE PHYSICIAN OR THE WELL MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS THAT THEY WOULD SEE UPON. EXITING PRISON- WOULD MAKE A LOT OF. US GO A LONG WAY FOR PEOPLE STAYING ON TREATMENT WHEN THEY COME OUT. OTHER THAN SPECIAL S. U. D. WE SEE UP TO EIGHT TIMES OVERDOSED US IN THE FIRST WEEK. WHEN PEOPLE ARE RELEASED SO- IT'S JUST I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION THIS IS JC COOPER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'M SO I ACTUALLY WITHIN THE KELLY PROPOSAL WE DO PROPOSE A MANDATE- THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS. ON RELEASE FROM PRISON INJAIL THE SCREEN FOR MEDIC CAL AND ENROLLED IN MEDICARE ALL OF ELIGIBLE THAT IS ONE OF OUR PROPOSALS THAT IS PROPOSED FOR. THE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE START DATE JUST TO BE CLEAR IN REGARDS THE TIMELINES OF THAT PROPOSAL IT ALSO INCLUDES. A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A WARM HAND OFF AND REFERRAL- TO. EITHER THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AND OR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN I TO CONTINUE ANY MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WHILE INCARCERATED- AND WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO OUR DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM. A PROPOSAL TO ALLOW FOR SOMEONE'S PRIOR SUBSTANCE USE ARE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY UPON A RE ENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY- AS WELL I AND SO MANY OF THOSE COMPONENTS THAT YOU JUST OUTLINED ARE A PART OF THE CALENDAR. OF LARGER PROPOSALS. GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER- DOCTOR REGULAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I FIRST I'M GONNA START BY- APPRECIATE APPRECIATING DR QUESTION WORDS WHERE HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT HOW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DOCUMENTATION HAVE BECOME BURDENSOME REMINDED ME OF MY DAYS PRACTICING AND THE STRUGGLE FROM THOSE OF US WHO ARE PROVIDERS AND HOW OFTENTIMES THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN OUR STATE CAPITALS ARE NOT LISTENING AND- HEARING THEM CLEARLY I WANT YOU TO HEAR DR QUEST YOUR WORDS WERE POWERFUL TO ME. YOU STATED THAT YOU ARE FOCUSING ON COMPLIANCE RATHER THAN YOUR CLIENTS AND THAT YOUR WISH WAS TO FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM LIST FOR YOUR CLIENTS HAPPY AND YOU STATED THAT THE CALLIN PROPOSAL WHILE IT'S BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT FOR YEARS WILL OFFER US THESE COMPREHENSIVE LARGE SCALE REFORMS SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH OUR OVER RELIANCE ON. DIAGNOSIS O I WANTED TO ASK TO SEE COOPER IF I COULD BECAUSE KEN LEWIS ALSO BROUGHT THE QUESTION UP ABOUT DIAGNOSIS LOOKING AT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU'LL NEED ONE OF THOSE NINETEEN DIAGNOSES TO RECEIVE TREATMENT. AS I'M READING IT UNDER THE CALLING PROPOSAL IT APPEARS THAT BENEFICIARIES NOW AFTER THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING RECOMMENDED. WILL BEGIN TO RECEIVE SERVICES EARLIER THAN THEY CURRENTLY ARE NOW. SO ECHOING CAN LEWIS'S QUESTIONS CAN YOU HELP US TO CLARIFY. IS DIAGNOSIS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. BEFORE RECEIVING THEM. SO CURRENTLY WITHIN OUR SYSTEM WE DO HAVE SOME RULES IN REGARDS TO WHEN YOU CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES- IT VARIES ACROSS ASSESSMENT VERSUS TREATMENT HOWEVER WHAT I WOULD SAY WITHIN THE CAL LEAN PROPOSAL WE ARE PROPOSING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE- MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES WHILE THEY ARE- YEAH. AS A POSITION IS DETERMINING A DIAGNOSIS- AND IF THE DIAGNOSIS IS DETERMINED THE THIRD THAT THERE IS NO DIAGNOSIS THAN THEY WOULD- AND NOT HAVE A TREATMENT PLAN PUT IN PLACE BUT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. YEARS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK- AS YOU HEARD PREVIOUS PANELISTS ACTUALLY SPEAK TO YOU ON THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS HAVE HAD TO PUT- PROCESS THESE IN PLACE THAT ARE PROBABLY- YOU KNOW INAPPROPRIATE IN ORDER TO BILL AND BE REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE. GIVING SOMEONE A DIAGNOSIS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO THE BILL WHEN MAYBE THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE- IN IN WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THOSE CASES WHICH IS WHY WE FEEL LIKE IT'S CRITICAL TO ALLOW FOR AT A CLINICAL PROVIDER TO ASSESS AN INDIVIDUAL UP PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS AND BE REIMBURSED FOR THE SERVICES AND WE HAD HAVE. WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH CMS THAN THEY- THE- BOTTOM AGREE WITH THE STATE THEY SAY ACTUALLY SO. BY MEDICAL NECESSITY AND LAW THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE RECEIVING SERVICES FROM A PROVIDER AND BE REIMBURSED FOR THEM WHILE THE TERMINATE DIAGNOSIS SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS. RECOMMENDATION IN OUR PROPOSED CHANGES. AS A- PROVIDER I WOULD JUST SAY THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND TREATING OUR PATIENTS RATHER THAN TREATING OUR CHARTS THE BETTER OFF WE WILL. BE DOING AS A STATE THANK YOU. MISTER RAMOS CENTER YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THANK YOU MR- THE QUESTION CENTERS AROUND THE NECESSITY AND THE PATHWAYS FOR INDIVIDUALS AT HIGHER RISK AROUND POTENTIALLY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING SUICIDAL IN THE HARM THAT'S THERE AND- BRINGING THAT TO THE USE OF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THE CLOVER NINETEEN AND THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN. AT OUR FOR OUR YOUTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THE PATHWAYS FOR INDIVIDUALS- SEVERELY AT RISK ARE WE INCLUDING THAT DISCUSSION OF THE TOPIC AND HOW WE'RE WE'RE MOVING FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES PARTICULARLY SUICIDE PREVENTION AND THE U. THAT WE KNOW ALL. OUR SEPARATE A HIGHER RATE THAN WE'VE SEEN BEFORE. YES I THINK THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE A BIT OF WORK IN THIS SPACE THIS IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND ENSURING THAT- INDIVIDUALS UNDER TWENTY ONE- THAT WE ARE ENFORCING THEIR RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS IN FEDERAL LAW AROUND P. PST T. TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO- TO PREVENT- AND TO PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. HISTORICALLY THERE HAS BEEN- AS SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR SOME A LACK OF CLARITY IN REGARDS TO THAT REQUIREMENT HOWEVER OTHER DEPARTMENT. HAS BEEN ENFORCING THE REQUIREMENT ACROSS BOTH SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE. DISORDER SERVICES AND MAYBE MORE CONFUSION ON THE SUBSTANCE USE HISTORICALLY THAN ON THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH BUT- BUT THAT IS VERY MUCH A REQUIREMENT ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS BOTH ON THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. AS WELL AS ON OUR COUNTY PARTNERS I TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO CHILDREN INCLUDING PREVENTATIVE SERVICES ACROSS THE BOARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'VE I'VE I'VE QUESTIONS A FEW QUESTIONS SO ON MY FIRST ONE'S GOING TO BE FOR- KIM KIM LEWIS- MISS LEWIS YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES PERSISTS- FOR SOMETIME ON THE ADVOCACY SIDE. THIS IS A LACK OF CLARITY ON WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IN THIS AREA. PARTICULARLY INVOLVING CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- IS THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN STATE LAW STATE REGULATION OR GUIDANCE FEDERAL LAW. OR SOME COMBINATION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION TO GET ONE WELL THE PROBLEM IS NOT A FEDERAL LAW I CAN TELL YOU- THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF CLARITY. ABOUT THE E. P. STT OBLIGATIONS I'M SORRY THERE'S LIKE FLASHING GOING ON BEHIND MY HEAD I APOLOGIZE LOOKS LIKE I'M ON FIRE- SO. THE I THINK THE FEDERAL IS VERY CLEAR ABOUT OBLIGATIONS TO INTERVENE EARLY AND OFTEN FOR CHILDREN IN TERMS OF BOTH SCREENING. YOU KNOW ASSESSMENT IDENTIFICATION PREVENTION ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE TREATMENT SO AND IT'S A VERY BROAD AND ROBUST ENTITLEMENT AS I TALKED ABOUT. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES ARE BIFURCATED SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE CREATED OVER MANY YEARS INCLUDING THIS CARVE OUT OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH HAS CAUSED THERE TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHO WOULDN'T EXACTLY HOLD THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT. AND I THINK THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS CLEARLY HAVE AN EXPANDED ROLE STARTING IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AS A RESULT OF THE PORTABLE CARE ACT WHICH IS MAYBE CREATED ADDITIONAL CONFUSION BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE AN EXPANDED BENEFIT THAT REALLY WAS INTENDED FOR THE ADULT EXPANSION POPULATION TRYING TO BE APPLIED TO KIDS. AND I THINK WHERE WE ARE NOW IS THAT. WE ENDED UP WITH AND AS I WAS TALKING ABOUT IN MY TESTIMONY AND IMPAIRMENT SORT OF FOCUS SO. KIDS AND THERE'S ALL THERE'S ALL STRONG MISUNDERSTANDING THAT MILD TO MODERATE AND IT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT FOR EXAMPLE ON THE MANAGED CARE PLAN SIDE. THAT THAT IS THE ONLY BENEFIT AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN WHICH IS NOT TRUE. CHILDREN ARE ARE ENTITLED TO NECESSARY SERVICES TO CORRECT AMELIORATED CONDITION PERIOD. AND SO WHETHER IT'S A SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SIDE WHERE THERE'S A LOT MORE SERVICES AVAILABLE OR WHETHER IT'S THE MANAGED CARE PLAN. THAT SHOULD NOT MATTER TO A CHILD OR FAMILY IT SHOULD BE BOTH OF YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE TO SERVE. THE NEEDS OF MY FAMILY OR MY CHILD AND THEREFORE FIGURE OUT WHO HAS TO PROVIDE WHAT. I THINK THIS IS WHY SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I ALLUDED TO IN THE CALIPERS ARE HELPFUL. IN THAT IT DOES MAKE IT MORE CLEAR YOU KNOW A CHILD CAN GET IN A SERVICE THAT'S AVAILABLE EVEN IF IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IF IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY. WHETHER THEY HAVE A MILD. MODERATE OR SEVERE LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT SO IMPAIRMENT AND I CAN INCLUDING THEIR EXCLUDED DIAGNOSIS SHOULD NOT. DETERMINE THAT. ARE REGULATIONS HAVE A LOT OF THAT EMBEDDED INTO IT ENTITLE NINE WHICH ARE VERY OUTDATED. AND THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA IN THE REGULATIONS ARE OUTDATED. AND THEY NEED TO BE CHANGED OR ELIMINATED. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANOTHER QUESTION FOR- MISS- MISS AT THE CASTLE- IS BECAUSE SO YOU ARE A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND YOU WORK AT THE CENTRALIZED ENTRY POINT FOR THOSE SEEKING SERVICES FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WHEN A CALL COMES IN DO YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE INITIALLY HOW SERIOUS A PERSON'S. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION IS AND WHICH SIDE A MEDIC CAL DELIVERS A pMEDICAMENTS CARE THE PLAN OR THE COUNTY OR IS THE FOCUS ON GETTING THE PATIENT INTO CARE IMMEDIATELY SO JUST. HOW DOES IT WORK IN YOUR COUNTY. IN MY COUNTY INITIALLY IT IS ABOUT ASSESSING FOR A CRISIS RIGHT NATIONALLY WE WANT TO GET THAT OUT OF- OUT OF THE WAY ARE YOU SUICIDAL HOMICIDAL. ANY ANY MAJOR CRISIS GOING ON WE HANDLE THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST. NOW ONCE THAT SETTLES FREIGHT THE NEXT QUESTION AUTOMATICALLY GOES TO WHAT IS YOUR INSURANCE. WHICH IS NOT VERY AT IT IT IT WE HAVE TO DETERMINE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE USE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REFER TO CAN THEY CAN THE CLINIC THAT WE REFER TO BILL FOR THAT. AND THE OTHER DAY ACTUALLY GOT A CALL FROM A STUDENTS USE THAT TWENTY YEAR OLD. YOUNG MAN AND HE CALLED AND HE WAS CRYING HE WAS VERY UPSET. HE HAS PRIVATE INSURANCE. NOW HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ALL THE HEROES HEALTH SERVICES ARE PRETTY IMPACTED. WE CAN'T REFER BECAUSE YOU HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE BUT WE DIDN'T REFER TO. A MENTAL HEALTH URGENT CARE WHICH- CAN PROVIDE CRISIS SERVICES REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE. AND SO THAT'S USUALLY THE WAY IT GOES WE HAVE TO DETERMINE INSURANCE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. MEDICARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE PAYING OUT OF POCKET FOR A MANAGED CARE PLAN. WE CANNOT REFER SO THERE THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THERE AND IF WE- WE GET THOSE CALLS ALL THE TIME AS WELL- MEMBERS TO CALL AND THEY DO HAVE MEDIC HEALTHY INTERNET TO HOLD THIRTEEN CARE AND THEY'RE BASICALLY TOLD TO GO AWAY NOW YOU HAVE. AN UNCONTROLLABLE COCAINE PROBLEM AND YOU ARE JUST USING TOO MUCH MATH. THIS IS NOT A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. RIGHT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE PARANOID EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE DEPRESSED PATIENTS ARE BEING TURNED AWAY CONSISTENTLY. WOW. THANK YOU APPRECIATE CRESCENTA. DR QUIST- A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU HERE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO. ANSWER FOR ME FIRST OF ALL HOW DOES THE REQUIREMENT FOR A DIAGNOSIS AFFECT THE FINANCING OF THE COUNTY- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DOES IT RELATE DOESN'T RESULT IN. WELL ACTUALLY TOLD US ABOUT A HUNDRED AND- EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE IN A NUMBER OF UNREIMBURSED COSTS- IS THAT. IS THAT IS THAT WHEN I HEARD CORRECTLY. THAT WAS JUST ONE OF. FORTUNATELY SO- IT IT IMPACTS HOW WE ACTUALLY- DETERMINE. OUR FULL DELIVERY SYSTEM OF SERVICES SO AND THE DIAGNOSIS RIGHT NOW IS REALLY EMBEDDED THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM WE CAN'T EVEN SUBMIT A CLAIM WITHOUT A DIAGNOSIS AND THEN WHO GROUND TYPE THING JUST A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE- BUT- I THINK THAT THE FORM PART IS THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO- BILL FOR. NECESSARY SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT. LATERAL SERVICES TO FIGHT TO TALK TO THEIR LOVED ONES- BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO- YOU KNOW OF THE STATE OF WOULD MAKE SENSE I DON'T A FULL TWO HOUR TO DO A ASSESSMENT RIGHT NOW BUT HAVE A THAT'S ABOUT TO START WOULD BE NICE FIRST TO BE ABLE TO ENROLL THE PERSON IN THAT GROUP. AND BE ABLE TO THAT UNTIL WE WERE ABLE TO GET SOMEBODY THAT CAN DO AN SS AND GET THE FLAG OF. SO PRETTY MUCH IS THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM. THANK YOU SO. OF ANOTHER. SO HOW DOES THE- YEAR C. P. RECKON. PROCESS AFFECT. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING FOR EXAMPLE ARE YOU ALWAYS HAVING TO SET ASIDE A RESERVE. FOR CLAIMS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO AS A GUARD AGAINST AND- AN AUDIT. IN A IN A CLAWBACK. AT DIFFERENT COUNTY DO DIFFERENT THINGS ON THIS AND THAT IS ONE STRATEGY THAT NEEDS SOME COUNTIES. USE MY COUNTY WEEK WE'RE ACTUALLY OWED MONEY SO- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH FREER MY BEST GUESS WOULD BE MAYBE EIGHT OR NINE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR MORE ABOUT- SEVEN YEARS BEHIND I THINK. SO THAT SORT OF GIVES YOU AN IDEA THAT MONEY STUDENT COUNTY AND ONCE IT COMES IN IT LOOKS IT JUST LOOKS WEIRD THAT THERE'S MONEY SHOWING UP AND THEN HOW HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. PLAN FOR THAT GOING FORWARD BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WE WERE NOT ABLE TO TELL THE PUBLIC OR TELL OUR- ELECTED OFFICIALS YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT WILL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. COMING IN EACH YEAR GOING. FORWARD AND IN ORDER TO. DEVELOP SERVICES AND CREATE A PROGRAM THAT'S SUSTAINABLE YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THE FUNDING BEHIND THAT PROGRAM SUSTAINABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE- QUESTIONS FOR PROBABLY JC- SO MANY OF THE CHANGES IN CALENDAR ARE ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE YOU HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH- HOW TO CHANGE THE PROPOSED FOR ENACTMENT IN THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THE GREEK AND THE DEGREE OF WHICH I VIEW AS A DELEGATION OF POLICY DECISIONS TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND YET TO BE CONCLUDED. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN I SEE THE PROBLEM ACTUALLY BEING IN STATE REGULATION. WHICH DH CS COULD CHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE PLACE- FOR EXAMPLE ARE PREFERRED- WELL I MEAN CAUGHT DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT ACTUALLY. I MEAN- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS GONE THROUGH EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK OVER US PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME ON THESE PROPOSALS. AND THEN ANYTIME OR SUBMITTING ANYTHING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INCLUDING WAIVERS STATE PLAN AMENDMENTS- EVEN WHEN WE ISSUE AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFORMATION NOTICES WE ALSO GO THROUGH EXTENSIVE- A QUARTER FEEDBACK AND COMMENT PERIODS TO REFINE AND- THOSE PROPOSALS BEFORE FINALIZATION- TO THE POINT MADE EARLIER ONCE YOU DO GET THOSE THINGS THE CMS THERE IS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATION TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE PIECES SO I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THERE WHICH IS. WHY I THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY OPEN TO YOU- AFTER WE FINALIZE. THE VARIOUS NEGOTIATIONS AND PIECES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMING BACKING CODIFIED THE DETAILS- ONCE THEY ARE ARE SETTLED- INTO INTO STATE LAW AND AS NECESSARY- WE MAY. DIFFER SLIGHTLY ON WHAT WE THINK SHOULD BE AND STATE LAW VERSUS NOT HENCE THE- REFERENCE EARLIER- BY OTHERS IN YOUR SEATS IS HOW OUTDATED THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA THAT WE'VE BEEN USING FOR SO LONG AS IN STATE. REGULATIONS AND HOW THAT REALLY HAS DRIVEN SOME OF THESE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND WE FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE. NIMBLE AN ABILITY TO CHANGE WHILE STILL RESPECTING THE RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE TO INFORM THAT AS WELL AS A STAKEHOLDERS TO FINE TUNE THOSE POLICIES AND SO I THINK. I WE HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS IN REGARDS TO FINDING THAT BALANCE- WHILE ENSURING THAT WE CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO OUR BENEFICIARIES. AND ENSURE THAT THEY GET ACCESS TO SERVICES. THANK YOU AND I. THAT HOWEVER I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU GUYS TO SPELL OUT THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN STATUTE ON ON ON ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES LIKE. I GUESS I COULD SEE- I COULD SEE. DH CS PICKING THE PARTICULARS A PARTICULAR SCREEN TOOL- AND AS I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE TO PICK A PARTICULAR TOOL IT BUT I THINK THE PROBLEMS IN IN REGULATIONS. REQUIRING A DIAGNOSIS BEFORE TREATMENT. CAN BE REIMBURSED COULD BE OVER WRITTEN BY STATUTE. OVER PRESCRIPTIVE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S MY COMMENT MY PERSPECTIVE- AND I WOULD HOPE THAT- WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON ON THIS AND IN THE FUTURE SO. RIGHT THANK YOU WITH THAT- WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL AND DR RAM BELOW THEN PUT DR RANDALL IN CHARGE. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PANEL TO ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENT REFORM WE WILL HAVE SIX PRESENTERS STARTING WITH DIRECTOR LIFE FORM. DEC CONFIRMED LINDE LINDE THE- TERM. COREY HOSPITAL BRIAN QUEST AND LEON GROWTH CLARK HARVEY LET'S BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR LIKE BORN PLEASE. SO- I WILL BE PROVIDING COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT- AND THEN LINDY AND OR- DIRECTOR LIKE WERE IN A BILLABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS IF NECESSARY- ALSO THE DEPARTMENT- I THINK ACTUALLY ONE OF THE QUESTIONS- T. TO FOR THE END OF THE LAST PANEL I. IS VERY APPROPRIATE FOR OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO DO YOU SEE S. IS PROPOSING A TO TRANSITION FROM A COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENT METHODOLOGY TO YOU OF A FEW SCHEDULES PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY TO DESCRIBE- THE METHODOLOGY CHANGE- UNDER CURRENT METHODOLOGIES ALL REIMBURSEMENT IS LIMITED TO YOU ACTAL COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES- WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW FOR VALUE BASED ARRANGEMENTS OR INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPACE- AND SO THE SHIFT IN METHODLOGY WILL ALLOW DH CS. I TO COLLABORATE WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS- FIRST- ESTABLISHING RATES FOR REIMBURSEMENT BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO COST INSTEAD FOCUS ON QUALITY AND VALUE OF SERVICES BEING PROVIDED- AS WELL AS PROVIDING MORE FLEXIBILITY TO COUNTIES TO EXPLORE INNOVATIVE PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS WHICH WE DO THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL- AND SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. IT ALSO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVED COORDINATION OF CARE- BY SIMPLIFYING OPTIONS FOR CONTRACTS AND PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE COUNTY. OF AND WE DO WANT TO ALLOW FOR THOSE RELATIONSHIPS YOU DEVELOP AND GROW- WITHOUT LIMITING FINANCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE COUNTY IN REGARDS TO BEING ABLE TO TAKE CONTRACTS FOR EXAMPLE WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS AND BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE REVENUE TO REINVEST THEM INTO THEIR THEIR DELIVERY SYSTEM. IT ALSO OF COURSE- AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL REDUCES STATE AND COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN- IT ALLOWS COUNTIES TO CLOSE THEIR ACCOUNTING RECORDS CLOSER TO THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR- BY ELIMINATING THE LENGTHY AND LABOR INTENSIVE COSTS BASED ON IT. AS WELL AS THE- COSTS RECONCILIATION. PROCESS WHICH AS AND EARLIER CAN. MANY MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE- SO IN ORDER TO JUST. THE APPROPRIATE PAYMENT DH CS IS. TO TRY SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. AND A CITY SERVICES BOTH MEDICARE AND DNC ODS JUST TO BE CLEAR- FROM WHAT'S- EXISTING IS CALLED HEALTHCARE COMMON PROCEDURE CODE- CODING SYSTEM OR WHAT WE CALL IT- LEVEL TO CODING TO LEVEL ONE CODING- THIS IS- PROPOSAL. ALLOW COUNTIES TO ALSO BE GROUPED IN NON REGIONAL PEER GROUPS FOR RATE SETTING PURPOSES. OF THIS WAS BASED OFF OF EXTENSIVE BACK AND FOR THE FACT THAT WE HAD WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN REGARDS TO GETTING. A TO THIS- IT ALSO ALLOWS. FOR MORE GRANULARITY AND DH YES RATE SETTING ON AN EXTRA PAYMENT TO COUNTIES IF WE DO IT THAT WAY VERSUS OTHER. METHODS WHICH WORK X. EXPLORED. IDEAS IS VERY COMMITTED TO PROVIDING- EXTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES DURING THE TRANSITION- AS REFLECTED IN OUR TELLING THE C. P. REQUEST WE THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THAT TA- DH CS HAS ALSO MET. OF WITHIN YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COUNTIES TO MAKE THIS CHANGE BY- JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWO- THROUGH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN. AND BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- WE DO PLAN TO WORK WITH COUNTIES TO DEVELOP MILESTONES AND ENSURE THEY ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEM. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS A REALISTIC TRANSITION- THE BUDGET- PROPOSES TO CREATE THAT- B. H. Q. I. P. THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING TO COUNTIES TO INCENTIVIZE SYSTEM CHANGES AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE- BOTH PAYMENT REFORMS. BUT ALSO REALLY GETTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF DATA INTO THE DEPARTMENT- THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO EXPLORE VALUE BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS I'D- BETTER DATA COLLECTION PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND ENHANCED REPORTING IN THE FUTURE. OF OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH DELIVERY. SYSTEM WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL TO THE TO AND AS WE CAN TO ON THE- IN THAT AREA FOR A BIT. HEALTH A CS I WILL CAO WITH IN. PAY TO THEM THROUGH THE TRANSITION OF THROUGH THE B. H. Q. I. D. ALL COUNTIES WOULD RECEIVE A BASE PAYMENT IN JULY OF TWENTY ONE- THEN COUNTIES WOULD RECEIVE ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AS THEY MEET PERFORMANCE METRICS. ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNTY AND APPROVED BY DH YES OF COURSE- SO JUST REALLY REITERATING HERE THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF PAYMENT REFORM IT'S PRETTY ESSENTIAL- TO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE WITHIN CALLIN- AS WELL FOR JUST OVERALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION IT ALLOWS FOR EASIER. I'M REGIONAL CONTRACTING A DELIVERY SYSTEM INVESTMENTS THAT WE THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE ON AND CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE HIGH QUALITY CONTINUE OF CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- IN MEDIGAP. AND THIS CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR WINDY HERRINGTON DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH CARE FINANCING DH CS. A SORRY JUST TO CLARIFY THAT WILL CONCLUDE ALL OF THE COMMENTS FOR DH YES% PERFECT THANK YOU TO SEE NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM COREY HARSHA LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. THANK YOU DOCTOR IN THE LAB- REGARDING PAYMENT REFORM- WE DO FIND THAT THESE REFORMS- HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AS DISCUSSED EARLIER REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON ON COUNTIES ASSOCIATED. ACCESS THE SAME FEDERAL FUNDS- INCLUDING AS DISCUSSED EARLIER DUE TO A VERY LENGTHY COST RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT IS UNDERTAKEN CURRENTLY- IN ADDITION WE ALSO AGREE THAT THAT THE SHIFT TO NEW PROCEDURE CODES COULD ALLOW FOR. A MORE NUANCED LEVEL OF UPDATED RECORDING- THAT COULD RESULT IN. INCREASED CAPACITY TO- IMPLEMENT YOU KNOW TRUE VALUE BASED. PAYMENT MODELS IN IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- TO BE IMPLEMENTED SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE- HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS REFORM IS NOT NOT FULLY SORT OF IMPLEMENT THIS THIS SORT OF TRUE VALUE BASED PAYMENT MODEL IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH YOU KNOW THE REFORM SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF MORE AS A- AN- INTERMEDIARY STEP TOWARD THAT GOAL. YOU KNOW TAKING THAT FURTHER STEP IN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING VALUE BASED CARE IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH IS GONNA REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES TO WORK TOWARD IMPLEMENTING FUTURE VALUE VALUE BASED PAYMENT MODELS- AND THE CURRENT TELLING PACKAGE- DOESN'T DOESN'T INCLUDE A STRATEGY FOR. HOW TO DO THAT JUST YET- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW WE WOULD JUST ADD THAT YOU KNOW PAYMENT REFORM IS LIKELY GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT LIFT ON THE PART OF COUNTIES YOU KNOW AS AS THE DEPARTMENT JUST ACKNOWLEDGED AND- THAT COUNTIES ME VERY AND- THEIR READINESS FOR TRANSITIONING TO THIS NEW FINANCING SYSTEM- AND YOU KNOW WHILE THERE ARE RESOURCES IN THIS BUDGET FOR YOU KNOW THE- THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM TO. SUPPORT COUNTIES IN MAKING THIS TRANSITION- THE STATE IS STILL GOING TO NEED TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH WITH COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE READY THEY'RE READY TO SORT OF MAKE THIS TRANSITION- FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE MAY BE ISSUES WITH COUNTIES NEEDING TO PUT MORE FUNDING INITIALLY UP FRONT DUE TO THE NEW PAYMENT MODEL AND- THE STATE WOULD SORT OF NEED TO HELP HELP COUNTIES WORK THROUGH WORK. THROUGH THOSE ISSUES- AND AN FOR THOSE REASONS YOU KNOW WE HAVE QUITE. ABOUT KNOW HOW THESE. THAT THE PROPOSED JULY TWENTY TWO TWO AND- BEACON- AND THOSE ARE ELLIE COMMENTS THE- HAPPY DEATH PROVIDE FURTHER ASSIST WE NEED. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DOCTOR QUEST. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN HI THERE I AM REHNQUIST THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECORDS. ONE OF THE PRIMARY BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE CALENDAR INFORMATION WILL COME BY WAY OF IN A PERFORMER AND AS A SOCIETY BEEN- ALLUDED TO COUNTIES HAVE LARGELY SELF. FINANCED THE NON FEDERAL SHARE OF OUR MEDIC HOUSE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES THROUGH THE- CP CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY WHICH REQUIRES PAINSTAKINGLY DETAILED BY THE MINUTE DOCUMENTATION OF THE COST SERVICES THE COST OF SERVICES. WELL THERE'S A BENEFIT IN THAT THE CP METHODOLOGY GUARANTEES SERVICES WILL BE REIMBURSED AT WILL COST THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DRAWBACKS WHICH WE HOPE TO ADDRESS THE TELLING. IMAGE REFORM PROPOSAL FIRST AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT RULES CHINESE IN OUR PROVIDERS- SADDLE SADDLE. DOCUMENTING SERVICES TO THE MINUTE WHICH MAKES OUR COUNTY SPECIALTY HEALTH SERVICES OUT LIAR WHEN COMPARED WITH MANAGED CARE OR OTHER PAIRS. TAKES TIME AND. ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE WRECK SERVICES. SECOND OUR REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES LIMIT INVESTMENT AND REINVESTMENT IN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO BILL FOR THE CUSTOMERS. THIS LIMITATION RESTRICTS OUR ABILITY TO USE VALUE BASED PAYMENTS TO INCENTIVIZE QUALITY OR TO INVEST IN OUR WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OUR NETWORKS OF SUBCONTRACTED WIDER. THIRD PROCESS FOR FINAL RECONCILIATION IS MENTIONED IN THE IN THE LAST SESSION CAN TAKE SIX TO TEN YEAR. CONCILIATION MEETINGS THAT COUNTY ONGOING FINANCIAL REST FROM YEAR TO YEAR SOMETIMES IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH CHALLENGES OUR ABILITY TO BUDGET FORECASTS AND MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY AND TRANSPARENTLY REPORT STATEWIDE SPENDING FOR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. AND FINALLY. NOT COUNTIES CONTRACTOR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN DETAILED RECORDS AND ARE SUBJECTED TO DETAILED AUDIT PROCESSES WHICH LEAD TO PROVIDER BURNOUT AND DIVERT RESOURCES AWAY FROM PATIENT CARE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN FAVOR OF COMPLIANCE LESS COMPLEX THAN MINISTRY OF BILLING REQUIREMENTS. WHAT WE HAVE NOT LOST OUR MISSION IS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS WE ARE CERTAINLY WEIGHED DOWN BY THE DEGREE OF DOCUMENTATION CURRENT REQUIRED THE MEETING BEGAN TO QUESTION WHETHER ACROSS PROCESSES WERE FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT THINGS. JALEN PROVIDES OUR PLANS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO GRADUALLY MODERNIZE HOW WE CAN CLAIM MEDICARE DOLLARS AND IN TURN. HOW WE CAN ARRANGE FOR AND PAY FOR OUR SPECIALTY- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. C. H. TWO D. AC IS THE SHIFT FROM THE CP TO THE I. T. TEAM. BASED REIMBURSEMENT AS A NATIONAL STEP TOWARDS MORE VALUE BASED REIMBURSEMENT WHICH WILL ALLOW OUR SYSTEM TO BETTER INCENTIVIZE QUALITY OUTCOMES. INCLUDING DISPARITY YEAH I REDUCING DISPARITIES FOR BENEFICIARIES. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS STUFF WE SUPPORT H. YESS PROPOSAL OR COST US IF YOU FOR SERVICE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FULLY COLOR COVER THE COST OF EACH SERVICE REACH COUNTY. WITH A PEER GROUP. TO ENABLE SYSTEM-REINVESTMENT. CVHS PROPOSED AT DH CS USED STATISTICAL ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY THE MOST APPROPRIATE POPULATION IN COST VARIABLES IN ORDER TO GROUP COUNTY FOR RATE SETTING PURPOSES WE WANT TO BE COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURSELVES. THE NEEDS WITH THESE GROUPINGS. NOW WE ARE ALSO CAUTIOUS IN SETTING UP OUR RATES THAT HISTORICAL COST DATA FOR COUNTIES AND SERVICE TYPES LIKELY DOES NOT FULLY CAPTURE FUTURE COSTS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE CALLING- WE RECOMMEND. WE RECOMMEND THAT DHS COLLABORATE WITH COUNTY IN OUTSIDE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AS NEEDED TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE RATE SETTING METHODOLOGY IT CAPTURES BOTH HISTORICAL COST DATA AS WELL AS A SORRY IT JUST MEANT FOR THOSE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE CURRENT OVERLY RESTRICTIVE PROGRAM. AREA WE MUST ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT THE I. G. T. PAYMENTS MUST BE MADE TIENEN. TO COUNTIES- AS COMPANIES WILL NEED TO SELF FINANCE THE COST OF SERVICES UP. WHILE THE CURRENT PLAN IS TO IMPLEMENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFORM NO SOONER THAN JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. YOU WOULD- OKAY WITH THE L. A. O. WE WOULD NOTE THAT JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS A VERY AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE FOR THESE CHANGES. REFER WILL REQUIRE COUNTIES AND CONTRACTED PROVIDERS TO ADOPT NEW MEDICAL CODING PRACTICES AND NEW CLAIMING AND REIMBURSEMENT PROTOCOLS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF THE OTHER COUNTY REFORMS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AROUND MEDICAL NECESSITY. TENSIFT TRAINING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CHANGES TERMINATES CONTRACT PROVISIONS IN RE ORGANIZATION WILL BE REQUIRED BULLS COUNTY SANDERSON. SUBCONTRACTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. YEAH EFFORTS FLOW EVEN IF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS TO RESPOND TO AN- COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC INCREASED DEMAND WILL PROBABLY LIKELY SEE AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS AFTER HOGAN- YOU JUST BEHIND. WELL WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE PROPOSAL TO HELP IMPLEMENTATION OF CRITICAL COUNTY MOST FORM STUDENTS- BEHAVIOR HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. IS THIS FUNDING IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS WILL SUPPORT RELATED SYSTEM REFORMS. WE ALSO PLAN TO WORK CLOSELY WITH DHS IN THE COMING MONTHS TO EVALUATE WHETHER A JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO IMPLEMENTATION DATE IS IN FACT FEASIBLE TO DEVELOP RATES. AND MAKE THE RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESS CHANGES WHAT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO PAYMENT REFORM. USE ME AS A NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU DR QUEST NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR CLARK HARVEY CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES. PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU I AM NOT GOING TO COVER EVERYTHING FROM DEVIATION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENTARY ON THE PROPOSAL MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED SOME WONDERFUL COMMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS AS A RESULT OF PROPOSED CHANGES TO OUR PAYMENT SYSTEM AND I'M HERE TO SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS CONTRACTED PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE THAT CVH EIGHT REPRESENT. SEVEN THE PROVIDER AGENCIES REPRESENTED BY EACH DAY WELCOME PLANNING TOWARDS REFORMING THE PAYMENT SYSTEM CALIFORNIA. FOR YEARS WE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT THE PAYMENT SYSTEM OPERATES AND THAT'S WE TRACK THE PAYMENT REFORM OF FOODS AND OTHER STATES. WE HAVE ENGAGED IN CONSISTENT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT FLEXIBILITY WE MIGHT HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO REDEFINE OUR FEEDBACK AND- THAT IS WHY WE ARE STILL HOPEFUL ABOUT WHAT COUNTING STUDENTS FOR. WE SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY REIMAGINE. THIS INCLUDING CLEANING PROCESS IN A WAY PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES ARE DESIGN THOUGH ASISTIR HIS YOU KNOW FROM HOME OR FROM THE L. A. L. YEAH THIS IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE. REFORM PROPOSAL BUT IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR WHICH WE ARE SUPPORTIVE. I THINK RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL I WILL BRIEFLY SHARE WITH YOU THE REFLECTIONS OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES. SO REGARDING THE TIMELINE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMENTS WITH THE LEGAL AND FROM DR QUIST. I THINK RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. AND JULY FIRST ONE TWENTY. PROVIDERS THIS IS PRETTY AMBITIOUS AS IT WILL TAKE LONGER TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. IF WE ARE ON TRACK FOR JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO THEN IT WOULD SEM THAT THE STATE WOULD TO HAVE ALREADY READY BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND STANDS PROVIDERS AREN'T COMPLETELY CLEAR ON HOW THE CHANGES TO THE PAYMENT SYSTEM MORE ACTUALLY PLAY OUT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE. OF COURSE PROVIDERS ARE EXCITED ABOUT AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHANGE FROM WHAT FEELS LIKE AN ARCHAIC LABOR INTENSIVE MINUTE BY MINUTE BILLING REQUIREMENTS AND WE HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS CHANGE WILL NOW MERE BUILDING STANDARDS. THAT ARE COMMONPLACE IN SOME OTHER GENERAL HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. SO WE'RE HAPPY TO HEAR THE COMMENTS FROM DOCTOR PUTS IN THAT PRIOR PANEL ABOUT THE LONGSTANDING DOCUMENTATION BURDEN THAT EXISTS. I KNOW THE NEW PAYMENT REFORM STRUCTURE MAY. RAISE SOME OF THE DOCUMENTATION BURDEN WHAT IS NOT ADDRESSED IT'S A STANDARDIZATION ACROSS THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. THAT IS A VERY MUCH. WE IMPORT TO THE US TO A THE AS PART OF COUNTY. INCLUDE THIS AS PART THE DISK THERE COULDN'T BE A BETTER TIME. OVERALL WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE- RISKY IN A WELCOME MATTER. AND ARE INCLUSIVE OF FEEDBACK WELL. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE C. B. AND NK WILL I'M CHANGES THAT ARE REQUIRED PROVIDERS THAT THERE MAY SOME SHORT. FOR EXAMPLE WERE IN TO ATTEND CODE TO BE A TO FOR SEVERAL ASKED AND HERO HALL SERVICES. THANK THE CPT AND AN FIX CODE DO NOT CONTAIN CODES ADEQUATELY COVER HERE ORDER ASIAN COORDINATION CASE MANAGEMENT TRANSITION OF CARE AND IN LOVE SERVICES. CLEARLY ABOUT HOW THE CODES WILL TRANSLATE TO THE WORK THAT PROVIDERS NEED TO BUILD FOR IS DESIRED. AS IT RELATES TO REIMBURSEMENT RATES MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS PANEL HAVE DESCRIBED AND COMMENTED ON THE PROSPECTIVE REIMBURSEMENT RATE METHODOLOGY. THE PROS INCLUDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE FUNDING FOR REINVESTMENT AND VALUE BASED INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND ARCHIVE. WELL PROVIDERS ARE EXCITED ABOUT THESE PROPOSED CHANGES FOR CLARITY IS NEEDED ABOUT THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING FROM THE CURRENT POPS UP ENFORCEMENT METHODOLOGY TO A PAYMENT STRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS A RATE SETTING STRUCTURE BASED ON ACTUAL COSTS. SO IN THEORY. TO A NEW STRUCTURE SHOULD BE A WIN WIN HOWEVER THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEAN WEIGHT COUNTIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING UNITS AND HOW BEST THAT WOULD BENEFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. SO THE FUNDING FOR THE STATE TO THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY TO THE CVS. IS CONCERNED IT CLEAR DIRECTION HAS NOT PROVIDED AND WE HOPE THAT APPROPRIATE. AND THEN TRAINING THERE IS SO MUCH EXCITING CHANGE AND PROVIDERS ARE JUST REALLY HUNGRY FOR IT. I'M MORE HOPEFUL THAT COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENSIVE TRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED TO HELP THESE ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL UNDERSTAND HOW TO OPERATE IN THIS REFORM PAYMENT SYSTEM BETTER STATUS IS FINDING. OVERALL THIS PROPOSAL WILL WORK IF IT IS OPERATIONALIZE WELL PROVIDERS LARGEST CONCERNS OR ABOUT THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY FOR EXAMPLE HOW THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE STATE TO THE COUNTY IS GOING TO TRANSLATE TO PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL TO ENSURE WHEN PAYMENT FLOWS DOWNHILL THAT IT MEETS THE PROVIDER GROWTH NEEDS TO ONLY SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. IF THE SYSTEM IS IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE BEYOND A FOCUS ON JUST PRODUCTIVITY AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON OUTCOMES AND QUALITY PROVISION OF CARE WHICH ARE CORE TENETS OF A WELL RUN SYSTEM. AIMED AT PROVIDING THE BEST BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE CALIFORNIA. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING AGENT WITH THE STATE AND ARE COUNTY PARKHURST ASSETS PROPOSAL TAKE SHAPE. THANKS. FOR LETTING US PROVIDE OUR COMMENTS TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MA'AM THAT CAN GO THIS- WE WANNA ASK ANY QUESTIONS. TOTAL THANK YOU DR EMIL. ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS WE OFTEN HEAR FROM MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN THE MEDICARE SYSTEM IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY SPEND- TREATING THE CHART- RATHER THAN TREATING THE PATIENT SO HOW DID THE HOW DOES THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICO WE COMPARE TO OTHER THIRD PARTY PAYORS. THANK YOU DOCTOR. IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PRIORITY THIS YEAR- BURDENSOME PAPERWORK- REALLY DISCOURAGES FOLKS FROM- ENGAGING IN THE FIELD AND PROVIDING THE TREATMENT THAT THEY STUDY FOR SO LONG- SO THAT'S AND REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT- I THINK. EIGHT TO THIRD PARTY HERE'S I'M NOT QUITE SURE THE MECHANISMS AND HOW IT RELATES BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA SHE HAS BEEN SO BIG THAT OUR ASSOCIATION HAS- COMMISSION TO STUDY AND WE FOUND THAT COMPARED TO YOU. MASSACHUSETTS NEW YORK- AND SOME OTHER STATES THAT WE HAVE FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. IT TAKES FIVE TIMES AS LONG FOR CLINICIANS TO COMPLETE THE PAPERWORK REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW THAT THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. SO FOR MEMBER AGENCIES THAT JUST HAPPENED ONE AGENCY IN ONE AREA THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH THEIR COUNTY INDIA SET OF PAPERWORK BUT FOR MANY OF OUR PROVIDER AGENCIES THAT HAVE- ENTITIES ACROSS SEVERAL COUNTIES. IT LOOKS DIFFERENT IN LA IT LOOKS DIFFERENT AND SANTA CLARA LOOKS DIFFERENT. ON AND ON AND ON SO THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT CONTINUES TO PLAGUE US THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING ON LEGISLATION FOR THIS. ISSUE THIS YEAR- AND WE REALLY DO HOPE THAT WERE ABLE TO YOU WORK OUR PARTNERS AT EAST. AND ARE STEPS TO FIGURE THIS OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR COSTS SO THIS QUESTION IS- KIND OF FOLLOW UP TO THAT AND THAT'S IS TO- THE DEPARTMENT. SO BECAUSE ONE OF THE PERSISTENT PROBLEMS WE HEAR IS ABOUT THE ERROR IS ABOUT DOCUMENTATION INVOKED THE LACK OF FINALITY. DUE TO THE MULTI YEAR RECONCILIATION PROCESS. SO I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE ANYTHING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OF THAT ELIMINATES DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS- CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT- SO ACTUALLY WITHIN THE TRAILER BILL- WE DO HAVE SOME NOTWITHSTANDING I REGULATION PIECES A LOT OF THOSE HISTORICAL AND VERY OUTDATED- DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE PROPOSING TO YOU- REMOVED- WITHIN THE CALLING- TRAILER BILL SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE THING TO NOTE. I ALSO WOULD KNOW AS WE- EXPLORED CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNTIES WE LEARNED THAT A LOT OF THOSE ARE NOT WITHIN ACTUAL ARE REGULATION OR EVEN STATE LAW- TODAY HOWEVER HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE- DUE TO PROTECTING THEMSELVES FROM HISTORICAL AUDIT. REPORTS OR PAY BACK ON THAT HAS. YOU KNOW RESULTED IN DOWNSTREAM REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDERS- AMY DO YOU NEED TO PROTECT PROVIDERS AGAINST THAT BUT IN THE MEANTIME THAT'S WHY IT'S THAT. YOU KNOW THE COMBINATION OF ALL THE CALIBER PUZZLE TOGETHER BOTH MEDICAL NECESSITY- AND PAYMENT REFORM ARE VERY CRITICAL TO ALL GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY REALLY IMPACT BOTH THE DOCUMENTATION SIDE. I'M AS WELL AS THE EXPECTATIONS THERE AND SO- WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE START ROLLING THESE OUT THAT COUNTIES DON'T PUT THOSE SAME TYPES OF REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE FROM AUDITING- AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. AND THAT'S WHY WHICH WHAT YOU JUST MISS CLARK WAS JUST SPEAKING TO IS REALLY WHY YOU SEE IT CHANGE FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY TO DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVE PUT IN DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS TO DIFFERENT PROVIDERS BASED ON THEIR HISTORICAL FINDINGS IN AUDIT- AND REIMBURSEMENT PIECES AND SO WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS THAT- WE DO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE NOT I'M PUTTING THAT BURDEN ON A DOWNSTREAM PROVIDERS- BUT DO YOU THINK THAT IT IT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE OVER MANY MANY YEARS BECAUSE OF- THE DEED THE AUDITING AND THE THEIR EQUIPMENT THAT HAVE BEEN. PUT IN PLACE ON THOSE COUNTIES AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RESEARCHER OF COURSE THANK YOU DR WERE LIKE AND IF WE WAS GONNA ASK OF YOU TO QUEST BUT IT BECOMES A BIT RHETORICA BECAUSE YOU ANSWERED IN OUR STATEMENT. JURORS AND HOW WE PLAN FOR THAT IT MAKES IT AWFULLY HARD FOR US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS INTO THE SYSTEM IF YOU LACK THE CLARITY THAT'S NEEDED FROM THE C. P. EASE. AND SO REALLY WANTED TO DO AGAIN A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD IT CORRECTLY. BECAUSE OF THE AUDIENCE BECAUSE OF THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS YOUR REIMBURSEMENT CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM SIX TO TEN YEARS. FOR YOU AS A PROVIDER TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S ACCURATE I THINK RIGHT NOW. THE CARD CHECK IS IN THE MAIL FIST YEAR THIRD FOR- MY COUNTY. YOUR CALL THEN ABOUT HOW REFERENCE. CHAU YOU ABILITY TO BUDGET AND PLAN AS WELL AS HOW IT LEADS TOWARDS PROVIDER BURNOUT ARE POWERFUL EXAMPLES FOR WHY THIS RECOMMENDED. CHANGE IS NECESSARY- I WILL- WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT IF I COULD I. THAT WE IDT WERE TO BE MADE MONTH AND THAT THERE WOULD A TRANSIT TO. QUARTERLY AND- JUST WANTED TO. UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AND HOW WE GET THROUGH THAT TRANSITION. THAT WAS THAT A RECOMMENDATION AS WE DID KIND OF EXTENSIVE- FEEDBACK FROM COUNTIES- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD A SMOOTH TRANSITION- BUT FROM THE WAY THAT THEY'RE PAID TO DATE- AS WE MOVE INTO THE- THE FEE SCHEDULE REIMBURSEMENT SCHEDULE AND SO BY HAVING IT CURRENTLY- GETTING A REGULAR CASH FLOW WE WANTED TO HAVE THAT TRANSITION BE AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE BY DOING MONTHLY- AND THEN EVENTUALLY MOVING TO A QUARTERLY I T. T. BECAUSE OF THE- WAY THE FUNDS. OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CITING CALIFORNIA- IT WOULD BE LESS BURDENSOME FOR BOTH THE COUNTY AND FOR THE STATE- TO EVENTUALLY GO TO QUARTERLY BUT THAT'S WHY WE PROPOSED TO START WITH MONTHLY AND THEN WHEN APPROPRIATE TRANSITION TO QUARTERLY- TO REDUCE THAT BURDEN ON EVERYONE BUT WHILE ENSURING THAT TRANSITION IS AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE FOR COUNTIES WE DO KNOW THIS IS A LARGE COMPLEX CHANGE FOR THEM- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL THROUGH THAT PROCESS- WHAT WE TYPICALLY DO. MOST IGT'S- THROUGH A QUARTERLY OR EVEN LONGER BASIS JUST TO BE CLEAR WE DO WANT TO BE AS FLEXIBLE THROUGH THE TRANSITION AS AS. POSSIBLE WE THAT I WILL- WILL HOLD THIS. ISSUE ITEM OPEN AS WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE. THREE BUT WOULD ECHO THE- OF- TO CLARK. TO MAKE THAT WE- THIS AFFECTED SO THAT WE HAVE THE- BENEFIT THAT ARE BEING PROMISE FROM PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR WE WILL GO AHEAD AND NOW MOVE ON TO THE THIRD PANEL- MEDICARE MANAGED CARE BENEFITS STANDARDIZATION- AND WITH THE PANELISTS AND MOST OF THE HOME YOU HAVE SEEN ALREADY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ADDITION HERE OF DR- DR STEWART- BUT THE LARRY SO I SURE I BUTCHERED THAT AND I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE DR SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN CORRECT ME WHEN YOUR TIME COMES FOR TO TESTIFY SO- WE'LL GO FIRST TO THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU. I'M SO UNDER TELLING DH CS IS PROPOSING TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT- THAT IS PROVIDED IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS STATEWIDE IT'S ONE OF OUR- GUIDING PRINCIPLES WITHIN THE PROPOSAL ITSELF. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE BENEFICIARY AS COUNTY OF RESIDENCE IS WE DO FEEL LIKE THAT THE BENEFIT SHOULD BE THE SAME. REGARDLESS OF THAT- WITHIN THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN SO THIS INCLUDES THE CARVING OUT OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PARKED IN. FOR MEDICARE MEMBERS ENROLLED IN KAISER IN SOLANO AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY SO IT'S A VERY SMALL. PORTION OF CARBON OF WITHIN THAT THAT WAS IDENTIFIED THROUGH EVALUATION OF STANDARDIZING THE BENEFIT. OF BASED ON DATA PROVIDED A FROM KAISER TO DH CS BASED ON THEIR CALENDAR YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SERVICE PERIOD- THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE BENEFICIARIES PER MONTH IN SACRAMENTO THAT WERE PROVIDED SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- BY KAISER. AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE AND SOLANO- THAT WERE UTILIZING SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH- KAISER- DH YES IT DOES HAVE ISSUE- OR HAD THE- GUIDE. TO K. HISTORICALLY IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY- THAT OUTLINES THE CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT ALL. MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- WHO MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA OF COURSE OFFER SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH HAVE A RIGHT TO REQUEST THAT CONTINUITY OF CARE OF THOSE SERVICES- AND SO- WE WOULD ENSURE THAT THAT B. AND- AT THROUGH THIS. AS WELL AS THEY DO HAVE THAT THAT RIGHTS- BENEFICIARIES WITH PRE EXISTING I- WHO MAKE KANU CARE RICK. TO THE COUNTY MAY HEALTH PLAN MUST BE THE OPTION TO CONTINUE TREATMENT FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS- I WITH AN OUT OF NETWORK MEDICARE PROVIDER- OR A TERMINATED NETWORK PROVIDER JUST TO BE CLEAR. I DURING THAT CARRY THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN IS. TO WORK WITH BENEFICIARY TO TRY THEIR CARE OF APPROPRIATE FOR WITH THE NETWORK IF THEY CANNOT COME TO ANY. FOR LONGER. WITH THAT PROVIDER IF THE BENEFITS YOU'RE- SO CHOOSES BUT- DOES HAVE A TWO MONTH THIS IS. TO WHAT WE- IN OUR MEDIC MANAGED PLANS- ONE OF THE ITEMS WAS ROLE OUT FOR PARITY. TO ENSURE I'M HEALTH- BENEFICIARY ARE ALSO RECEIVING THE COTTON OF CARE- ADDITIONALLY THE- WERE RICH A LOT. IN THOUSAND- AND ARE NOT NEW BUT- OUT THROUGH EMPLOYMENT. OF PROP THIRTY THEREFORE DH THE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS TRIGGERED A GENERAL- BACKFILL AS COUNTIES RECEIVE REALIGNMENT. AT PROVIDE SIR TO THESE YOU- HOWEVER A BEGINNING INTO THOUSAND SIX SEVEN. MINUTES DEVELOPED IN ALLOCATE METHOD BAY ON. FEEDBACK I WOULD THAT THAT BASE REVENUE AMOUNT FOR EACH COUNTY ON HIS. CAL EXPENSE. I THE- COUNTY. USED ABOUT THE BASE ALLOCATION METHOD ALL. AND CLAIMS KAISER BENEFITS AND- COUNTY BUT IT DID NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR BEEN. IN STOCK OF COUNTY. AT KAISER BECAUSE IN. WEREN'T IN THE- ALLOCATE METHOD ALL BECAUSE THE LAWN HAD EIGHT THIS POPPY AT THE- OF THE- WAS DEVELOPED- DH CS KERR S. A SEPARATE. OUT I WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE. BY THREE PER EIGHT MILLION IF THE COST HAD BEEN. INCLUDED IN THAT INITIAL CALCULATION. AND THIS CONCLUDES THAT WENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT. VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY- SEE COREY HOW SHE CON. ON THIS SITE PLEASE. THANK YOU THANK AFTER WHAT I'M I'LL BE VERY VERY AND ARE COMMENTS THIS ISSUE- WE HAD QUESTIONS- THAT WERE ACTUALLY JUST SORT OF ADDRESSED BY DEPARTMENT RELAY TO SOME OF THE RELY IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CAR OUT OF THE CERTAIN FROM. CARE AND SO- WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF FURTHER CONCERNS RAISED AT THIS APOSTLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DOCTOR. IT RING BE ABLE HEALTH CORRECT FOR CAN. SO RECOGNIZING THAT THE PLAN- CAL IS TO HAVE A STEP ACROSS DIFFERENT IN WELL I'M AS I ON THE OTHER- INITIATIVES- VERY- HAPPY IN A PRE FOR THE COLLABORATION AROUND THE OTHER CAL MINISH. ALSO APPRECIATE- RECORD LIKE AND SOME BEACH S. H. YES STAFF HAVE READ OUT TO A- OR IN ORDER TO TALK US ABOUT SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ON THIS- BUT THIS PARTY- PROPOSAL IS A LITTLE BIT- CONCERNING TO US- SO WANTED YOU SOME FACTS THAT WE HAVE IN SOME OF THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO. NOT COMPLETELY UP WITH THE OF WERE SENT- IT J. C. JUST UP FROM- BUT- THIS WAS IN FROM THAT WE AT THE TIME. THAT WE WERE HAVE COME WITH KAISER AROUND THIS TRANSITION- SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA- SIR CAN. CURRENTLY SERVES UPON THIRTY FIVE. CLIENTS YEAR AND THE INITIAL THAT WE HEARD FOR CLIENTS THEIR WORDS AND- THE NUMBERS YOU HEARD YES NOW WE'RE- PER MONTH NUMBERS IN THE NUMBERS WE RECEIVE WHERE A PRE. I'M SO AND A COMPARISON PER YEAR PER YEAR SO SACRAMENTO COUNTY. SERVES APPROXIMATELY THOUSAND CLIENTS A YEAR HI SIR. THAT IT'S- MATH. SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL AND POP WOULD ACROSS ABOUT THOUSAND ADDITIONAL BENEFITS YOU TO THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THIS WOULD BE A THIRD SIX SIX SEVEN THANK. IN OUR- ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PUBLIC- WE WOULD NEED TO- BUILD OUT NETWORKS- IN. COSTLY AND SCARE IMP CARE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF IDEA I THAT FIGURE IT WAS JUST NOT WILL THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THE BE ABLE TO INCREASE. I JUST OPENING AN OPENING ONE THIS YEAR AND THAT'S COSTA SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND IT TOOK ME FIVE YEARS TO OPEN THAT. SO I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW OPEN- ANOTHER PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITY REALLY QUICK SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SERVE THOSE. IMPATIENT CONSUMERS WITHIN OUR EXISTING FREESTANDING HOSPITALS AND SO WE WON'T HAVE ANY FEDERAL- REVENUE TO COME ALONG WITH THAT SO WE'VE ALREADY BLOWN PAST THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE WATER YEAH- SO- I'M- SORRY JUST A SECOND. SO THIS IS A THAT WAS A REALLY BUT THIS IS A REALLY BLACK ANALYSIS- BECAUSE TO BE HONEST WEEK WE HAVEN'T WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THIS. AT THIS POINT FROM KAISER ROUNDING EXACTLY WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT IN A VERY BLUNT ANALYSIS WERE INCREASED TO. THANK YOU FOR ASKING INCREASE THE NUMBER RESEARCH BY THIRTY SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT. SACRAMENTO WOULDN'T NEED TO INCREASE OUR BUDGET BY THIRTY SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT. THIRTY SIX POINT 7% OR BUDGET IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY. HUNDRED THIRTY POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD OUR CAPACITY- THIS FIGURE DOES INCLUDE SOME FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION% SO IT MAY BE CLOSER TO ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I WANT TO REITERATE THIS IS NOT A PRECISE FIGURE. BUT I JUST WANT TO ILLUSTRATE THE MAGNITUDE OF OUR NEED IN ORDER TO. SERVE THE BUT THE TYPE OF. NUMBERS OF CONSUMERS THAT THAT ARE BEING COMMUNICATED TO US- JUSTICE CONCERNING IS THE LACK OF RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THIS TRANSITION. THE STATE'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR AN ADEQUATE TIME. TO PLAN FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE OR ELEVEN THOUSAND HUMAN BEINGS NEEDING CARE THEY'RE COMPLEX AND VULNERABLE BIG BENEFICIARIES AND- THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT THE CONTINUITY OF CARE REQUIREMENTS I I'D- BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING ALL THE- RULES AROUND AT THE CONTINUITY OF. CARE- THANK. I THINK THAT THERE ARE SO. REQUIREMENTS RIGHT AS I HAVEN'T. BRUSHED UP ON THIS RECENTLY BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME REQUIREMENTS THAT SAY THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO BILL MEDICARE NOW- BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE WILLING TO SIGN OUR MEDIC HEALTH CONTRACT. AND THEN ALL THESE- REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. A CASE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DO THOSE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND- RIGHT. YOU CONVERSATIONS OVER THE YEARS WITH KAISER- COLLEAGUES- I THINK THAT THOSE- DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE DIFFICULT- SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WITHOUT RESOLUTION OUT OF THE VARIOUS CONCERNS. BURKE COUNTY WOULD CERTAINLY BE WILLING TO CONSIDER RAINEY'S KIND- BENEFICIARIES INTO OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN SERVICES WE KNOW WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH HIGH QUALITY CARE THIS IS OUR EXPERTISE. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE WOULD NEED ADEQUATE FUNDING TRANSACTION PLANNING AND CARE COORDINATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DR STUART NONSTOP THERE LET DR MAYBE CAN CORRECT MY PRONUNCIATION OF HIS LAST NAME SO. THANK YOU DOCTORS WOULDN'T ARAMBULA I'M A DOCTOR STORE BUT LAYER. REGIONAL DIRECTOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION MEDICINE FOR COLLEGE PERMANENTLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR MEDIC CAL TEAM AS THE PRIMARY MENTAL HEALTH REPRESENTATIVES. AND COLLABORATE WITH COUNTIES WHERE A KAISER HAS A PRESENCE. BUT BEFORE COMING TO KAISER I WAS A PROGRAM MANAGER FOR ACUTE SERVICES IN MARIN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SO I HAVE BACKGROUND IN WORKING WITH COUNTIES AND BEING A PART OF THE COUNTY SYSTEM. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY ON THE PROPOSED. ESPECIALLY IN FROM KAISER IN SULAIMON SACRAMENTO. A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH SOLANO AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF COLLABORATION IN PROVIDING SPECIAL EMAIL HEALTH SERVICES DRAMATIC HOW MEMBERS BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN. HI THIS IS A LEADING EDGE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND PROVIDING AN INTEGRATED MODEL OF HEALTH CARE FOR THESE VULNERABLE MEMBERS FOR UNDER IF YOU WILL- FOR CAMPAIGNS THE VISION TO INTEGRATE SERVICES FOR THEM- OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THESE TWO COUNTIES AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO IT. PATIENTS IN THESE COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY INTEGRATED WITHIN OUR HEALTH SYSTEM. AND RECEIVING INTEGRATED CARE INCLUDING SERVICES FOR SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN IDEAL CARE MODEL ENSURES CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF CAMPAIGN. WE CARE ABOUT OUR PATIENTS AND NOT DISRUPTING THEIR CARE WE NUMBER WERE SPEAKING TODAY ABOUT THE MOST VULNERABLE OF OUR MEDICARE MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT ONLY LOW INCOME. BUT ALSO SUFFERING FROM MORE SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND ONLY WORSENED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THEY HAVE A LARGE BILL DECLINE- CURRENTLY KAISER PERMANENT DAY WE PROVIDE THE FULL CONTINUUM OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR MEDICARE MEMBERS IN THESE COUNTIES. ARE INTEREST IS IN ENSURING THAT THESE MEMBERS STRUGGLING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY AND TIMELY CARE. IMAGINE YOURSELF AS A MEMBER OF A PLANNED YOU SEE SEE YOUR PCP. IS CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION BY MENTAL HEALTH. YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER USE YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS AND SEIZE THE IMMEDIATE LIKE TRONIC REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION. YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER BEGIN SEEING YOU AND TREAT YOUR CONDITION. YOU THEN HAVE AN EPISODE WHERE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. DETERIORATES AND YOU BECOME SERIOUSLY ILL. THEN TOLD WE'RE SORRY BUT YOU NEED TO LEAVE OUR CARE IMAGINE IF THAT WAS A DIABETIC PATIENT OR SOMEONE WITH A CARDIAC CONDITIONS ON THIS WORSENED AND YOU WERE TOLD THAT SUDDENLY YOU YOU HAD TO GO ELSEWHERE FOR CARE. HOW WOULD ANY OF US FEEL IT IS CHALLENGING FOR ANYONE TO LEAVE AN INTEGRATED ARE SYSTEM OF CAREBUT IT WILL BE ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING FOR THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE TO GO DIDN'T PROVIDERS. TO US THIS SEEMS COUNTER TO CALLAHAN'S GOAL. TO PROVIDE MORE INTEGRATED HOLISTIC CARE TO MEDICARE MEMBERS. THIS IS ALREADY WHAT ARE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND SOLANO AND SACRAMENTO RECEIVED. BUT WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH BOTH COUNTIES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DETERMINE HOW BEST TO TRANSITION THOSE MEMBERS. WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS- INTO A NEW ARRANGEMENT WE CONSIDER BECOMING A SUBCONTRACTED PROVIDE THIS CARE TO OUR MEMBERS IF THAT COULD BE WORKED OUT- IN BRIGHTON AND RYAN- JUST OUTLINED SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. WE WANT TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR MEMBERS AND PATIENCE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING US TO BE HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. IN THE MEMBERS HE CHRIS QUESTION. I'VE GOT I'VE GOT A COUPLE IN AN FIRST FALL DR KRISTIN DR BILL THERE YOU ACTUALLY ANSWERED A COUPLE QUESTIONS I WAS GOING TO ASK BUT I'M GONNA ASK ONE THAT SAID YOU MIGHT NOT BE EXPECTING AND I JUST I JUST SAY IT OUT OF A MINUTE I'M JUST CURIOUS SO. AND THAT IS THAT AS- PATIENTS HAVE YOU MAYBE TRANSITION BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN. RISER IN THE COUNTY AS FAR AS- AS FAR AS THEIR FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- CAN YOU DESCRIBE HOW THE ROOM. MEDICAL RECORDS GET THERE AND- FIRST WITH DOCTOR QUIZ YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW DO YOU GET RECORDS FROM KAISER AND- AND HOW DO YOU GET RECORDS BACK SO THAT SO THAT THE PATIENT'S. RECORD THIS WHOLE NOT JUST THEIR BEHAVIOR HOPE WITH THE ENTIRE RECORD IS HOLE SO WHAT IS THE COOPERATION LIKE BACK AND FORTH. AS FAR AS EXCHANGE OF RECORDS. AS WITH ANY TIME- DOING CARE COORDINATION WE WOULD- OBTAIN A RELEASE OF INFORMATION FROM THE CONSUMER AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION EXCHANGE. THANK YOU I THINK WE HAVE GOOD CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK IT IS AN ONGOING- RELATIONSHIP BUILDING EXERCISE THAT I THINK MANY PEOPLE I THINK EVERYBODY THAT WORKS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- NOT. RECOGNIZES IT AS SOMETHING THAT'S PART OF THE JOB IS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR WITH OUR OTHER. SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE THAT ARE HELPING THE CONSUMERS THAT WE SERVE. SO THE YOUR- IT'S ADEQUATE THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION. YOU'RE GETTING WHICH WITH YOU'RE GETTING WHAT YOU NEED WHAT YOU NEED FROM EACH OTHER. YEAH I THINK SO. I MEAN WE HAVE CHALLENGES THAT BUT THAT'S PART OF THE JOB IS WORKING. ON THANK YOU- AND I GUESS THE QUESTION ACTUALLY DID HAVE A QUESTION SO AS A DOCTOR WILL THERE TALKED ABOUT. THAT KIZER MIGHT BE OPEN TO A SUBCONTRACTING SO ARE THERE ACTUALLY DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING. BETWEEN THE COUNTIES ABOUT A CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW KAISER TO CONTINUE TO TREAT. A AND SEE THEIR- THERE THE PAGE OR THE PATIENTS- SEE ACTUALLY CONTINUES EITHER KAISER MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS OF THEIR ANY DISCUSSIONS GOING ON NOW. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'VE HAD ENOUGH CONVERSATIONS. YEAH OKAY GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU- I GOT A QUESTION FOR THE- QUESTION COMMENTS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS ONE OF THE THEMES OF CALAMUS BETTER INTEGRATING CARE AND I UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENTS TO ALIGN BENEFITS ACROSS VARIOUS MANAGED CARE MODELS- BUT MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF AN EXISTING INTEGRATED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN FURTHERANCE OF THE GOAL OF STREAMLINING BENEFITS IS GOING TO BE DISRUPTIVE WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF ALREADY HEARD THAT- TO THE ONGOING INTEGRATED CARE KIND CARE KAISER MEMBERS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES- AND THAT HAS THAT CREATE SUCH. CONCERNS FOR ME WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION LATER ON THE AGENDA ON A FULL INTEGRATION PLAN AND THIS SEEMS TO BE COUNTER TO THAT DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. I CAN UNDERSTAND- THE SENTIMENT OF YOUR COMMENTS IS AS WHAT I WOULD SAY I THINK- THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT IS TAKING PLACE IN REGARDS TO THE SPECIAL THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED CURRENTLY- BY KAISER- THE ULTIMATELY DID RECOMMEND. A FOR THE STREAMLINING OF THE SERVICES ACROSS ALL THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY- THE- SACRAMENTO YEAH THE COUNTY SACRAMENTO CAN FULLY CONTRACT BACK AND ACT CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE BENEFICIARIES BEING SERVICES PROVIDED BY KAISER- THROUGH A CONTRACTUAL. RELATIONSHIP OF FOR THEM TO CONTINUE IN THE COUNTY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE JUST AS THEY ARE WITH ANY OTHER I'M CONTRACTED PROVIDER TO OVER OVERSEE THAT RELATIONSHIP. I'M SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE IN OTHER AREAS WHERE I COUNTIES HAVE PARTNERED WITH- MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE OTHERWISE RESPONSIBILITY- AT THAT OF THE COUNTY- SO UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS THAT YOU ARE MAKING HOWEVER- THE PROPOSAL CURRENTLY AT THIS TIME IS TO STANDARDIZE THE MEDICARE BENEFIT- WITHIN MANAGED CARE. THANK YOU. MY RECOLLECTION- FROM MEDICAL LSS RATIO DISCUSSIONS- SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT KAISER OPERATES A MEDIC CAL- AT A LOSS SO WHILE THE DEPARTMENT IS ASSUMING SAVINGS FROM THIS PROPOSAL BY SHIFTING THE BENEFIT BACK TO THE COUNTIES IT'S REALLY JUST REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF A LOSS- THE ELASTIC KAISER EXPERIENCES AND SHIFTING THE COST TO THESE TWO COUNTIES AM I WRONG ABOUT THAT. WELL I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE SIZERS REPORTED LOSSES IN MEDIC HOUSE WITH A BIG LEAD TO THESE TO A VERY SMALL PORTIONS- THE BENEFIT AND LIVES THAT- ARE BEING REPORTED HERE TODAY I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LOT MORE ANALYTICS AND IN REGARDS TO THAT CORRELATION- IN ORDER TO DRAW THAT CONCLUSION. SO ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO FUND THESE TWO COUNTIES IF WE RETURN THE BENEFIT TO THE COUNTIES BECAUSE OF WHAT PROP THIRTY REQUIRES- SO. AS WE STATED IN OUR AND OUR COMMENTS ARE SOLANO ACTUALLY- HAD ACCOUNTED FOR IT IN IN THE NUMBERS THAT THEY PROVIDED US IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. BASE ADJUSTMENTS AND SO- WE ACTUALLY ARE CURRENTLY PAYING US SOLANO AFFORD THESE SERVICES AND TECHNICALLY PAYING KAISER- FOR THESE SERVICES WITHIN. THEIR CAPITATION RATE IN- FOR THE PURPOSES OF SACRAMENTO WHICH IS THE ONE OUT LIAR. I'M SACRAMENTO HAD NOT REPORTED THESE LIVES AT THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING COVERED BY KAISER IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SO THAT ADJUSTMENT WASN'T MADE- WE DID GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT IS ABOUT THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN- OTHERWISE PROVIDED. TO YOU SACRAMENTO IF THAT INFORMATION HAD BEEN REPORTED IN REGARDS TO THEIR- REALIGNMENT AND WE ARE- AS BRIAN MENTIONED. HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM IN REGARDS TO. THOSE DIFFERENCES WE ALSO HAVE AT. KAISER HAS REPORTED DIFFERENT NUMBERS TO US VERSUS THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO THE COUNTY. IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF WIVES SERVED- AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S BECAUSE MAYBE YOU ARE ALL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVER INCLUDED VERSES JUST SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- BUT WE ARE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH- KAISER AS WELL AS- THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO TO. RECTIFY THOSE DISCREPANCIES. THANK YOU AND THEN THE FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE. CAN THE CHANGES BE MADE TO GRANDFATHER IN EXISTING PATIENTS WHO ARE RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FROM KAISER PROVIDERS. SO THE CHANGE. ONLY AFFECTS NEW ENROLLMENT. THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING WOULD HAVE TO TAKE YOUR THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS IS THAT WE CURRENTLY AREN'T GETTING THE- LEVEL OF INFORMATION AND CRITERION OVERSIGHT ON THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT WITHIN THE CARS ARE CONTRACT. BECAUSE OF THAT CONTRACT IS DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT VERSES THROUGH THE COUNTY WHERE THAT COULD HAPPEN SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR. US TO CONSIDER- THOSE PIECES HOWEVER- HAPPY TO CONSIDER AND DO THAT ANALYTICS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL THREE AS WE MOVE ON THE PANEL FOR ON THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM WE WILL HAVE FIVE SPEAKERS THREE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DIRECTOR LIKE BORN TRACY COOPER AND CALLIE PFEIFFER. FOLLOWED BY VERONICA KELLY AND CULBERT SAID NELLA IF WE CAN PLEASE BEGIN WITH THE H. THE US. THANK YOU AND I WILL PROVIDE ALL OF OUR OPENING COMMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THEN- DR PIPER AND A DOCTOR LIKE WORKING GIVE BILLABLE FOR QUESTIONS AS NECESSARY. I'M SO WITHIN THE CALLIE PROPOSAL- IN REGARDS TO BE. A DRUG- BUT THE AND CO DS PROGRAM- DCS IS PUTTING FORWARD A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS REALLY IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR LEARNING FROM THE FIRST. FEW YEARS OF DNC ODS- MANY OF THE PROPOSES OF INCLUDE- ELIMINATING THE TO YOU OF STATE ANNUAL LIMIT FOR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. CLARIFYING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOVERY SERVICES REQUIRING ALL FACILITIES TO OFFER AND REFERRED TO MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT- I'M ADDING ADDING EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR YOUTHS UNDER TWENTY ONE- ADDING CULTURALLY DEFINED SERVICES AND NATURAL HEALERS AS A BENEFIT FOR INDIAN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS- AS WELL AS EXPLORING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT. ARE CLEAR FINE PROVIDER TYPE OF THE TREATMENT OF PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS. AND TREATMENT A POST INCARCERATION AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN THIS- INFORMATION HEARING. AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF OTHER TECHNICAL UPDATES TO DMCA YES. I'M DO YOU SEE AS AIMS TO DESIGN A COHESIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS BENEFICIARY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER- IT NEEDS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM- AND ENSURE THAT ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. RECEIVE COORDINATED SERVICES- ENTER COMMOTE LONG TERM RECOVERY SO WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THESE PIECES AND MANY OF THEM WHAT WERE PUT FORWARD- IN OUR TWELVE MONTH EXTENSION TO CMS AND ARE CURRENTLY BEING. CONSIDERED BY CMS FOR INCORPORATION INTO THE DNC ODS OUT WAIVERS OTHERS ARE STILL BEING CONTEMPLATING IN THE CURRENT OF RENEWAL PROCESS THAT IS BEFORE US- ADDITIONALLY DH CS IS- NOT PROPOSING TRAILER BILL TO IMPLEMENT THE VARIOUS DMC ODS CHANGES- DAC AS PER POST. BILL LANGUAGE- REALLY JUST INCLUDE SECTION TWO. OF THE AS A COMPOSER F K. UP WITH THE FRAME OF THE TREE BILL INDISTINCT MY CAR AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE DR KELLY DIRECTOR OF THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT. OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THIS YEAR DIRECTOR KELLY. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD IN DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND HAPPY PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH. A RECENT ANALYSIS OF THE CDC AND CDPH DATA BY CALIFORNIA HEALTH POLICY STRATEGIES FOUND THAT FATAL. DRUG RELATED OVERDOSES IN CALIFORNIA INCREASED BY 50% BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. THAT'S A MORE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THAT OCCURRED IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES WHAT MUCH OF THAT INCREASE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS LIKE FENTANYL. WHICH IS A PAIN MEDICATION FIFTY TO A HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE WHICH IS OFTEN MIXED INTO OTHER DRUGS INCLUDING HEROIN AS WELL AS COCAINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE. TO AND DEFINITELY A FACT. I CAN ATTEST TO THIS NOT ONLY AS A CLINICIAN BUT ALSO AS A MOTHER. A WITH A DAUGHTER WHO HAS AND OPIOID USE DISORDER- I REVERSED AND OVERDOSED ON IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND MY HOME. AND THAT WAS DUE TO FAN. SHE WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS THERE THAT I HAD IN OUR CAN'T CAN'T. OUR ENTIRE FAMILY WAS LUCKY SHE IS IN RECOVERY AND SHE SURVIVES. BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THE SAME ANALYSIS FOUND THAT DEATHS LINKED TO SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS ROSE FIVE HUNDRED AND 41% IN THE SAME THREE YEAR PERIOD IN CALIFORNIA. AND THOSE OPIOID RELATED DEATHS SPECIFICALLY AFFECTED AND IMPACTED YOUNGER CALIFORNIANS. COMING NINETEEN AND SECRETARY GALI IS KNOWN TO IDENTIFY IS AN EXCELLENT. AND COPING AND COUNTIES HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN FENTANYL RELATED OVERDOSES SINCE THE START OF THIS PANDEMIC. WAS REPORTED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE THE PANEL RELATED OVERDOSES EXCEEDED COVERED NINETEEN RELATED DEATHS IN TWENTY TWENTY. THESE TRENDS MAKE KNOWLEDGE IN ACCESS TO DRUG TREATMENT AN URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER. TBH DAY GREATLY SUPPORTS THE. AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY DH CS. FOR EXISTING DRUG MEDI CAL DELIVERY SYSTEM WAIVER TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THIS IS A JOINT STATE COUNTY DEMONSTRATION AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO UPDATE THOSE TERMS BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR FIRST FIVE YEARS AND THIS NATIONALLY. PRECEDENT SETTING EXPANSION OF RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT AS A BENEFIT THROUGH MEDICAID FOR EXAMPLE WE COMMEND THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES PROPOSAL TO INCREASE ACCESS TO DMC YES FOR YOU. WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS BY ADDING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE POINT FIVE. EARLY PREVENTION. BENEFITS FOR THE MEDICAL CLIENT WHO'S UNDER THE AGE OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CARRIZO WORKED REALLY HARD TO IMPROVE OUR SPECIALTY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES FOR YOU AND THE ABILITY TO OFFER COVERAGE SERVICES TO A BROADER POPULATION OF YOUTH WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD REVERSING THE ALARMING TRENDS THAT WE ARE NOW CURRENTLY SEEING. IN ADDITION WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A CLIENT CENTRED LOW BARRIER APPROACH TO ENGAGEMENT TO TREATMENT THAT- YES DEMONSTRATION MUST ALLOW FOR SERVICES TO BE REIMBURSABLE EVEN IF A CLIENT CHOOSES TO LEAVE TREATMENT BEFORE THE COMPLETE ASSESSMENT. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT PLANNING PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THIS CHANGE WOULD ALSO HELP ALIGN. REQUIREMENTS ARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND DMC ODS PROGRAMS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF CAL AIM TO MOVE COUNTIES TOWARDS GREATER REALIGNMENT AROUND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAMS. WE ALSO WANT TO ASK THE STATE TO WORK TO ADVOCATE STRONGLY AGAINST ARBITRARY LIMITS ON REIMBURSEMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL LENGTH OF STAY. AS WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE BASED ON CLINICAL. OR IT WILL PRODUCE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR CLIENTS. RECOVERY VARIES PERSON TO PERSON THERE IS NOTHING MAGICAL ABOUT THIRTY DAYS SIXTY DAYS NINETY DAYS. CBJ HAS LONG ADVOCATED THAT THE STATE ELIMINATE THE TWO EPISODES LIMITATION ON REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ADULT RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SERVICES THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL DMC YES DEMONSTRATION. AND THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR ADVANCING THIS CHANGE. BUT CAUTION THAT THE TWO EPISODE LIMIT SHOULD NOT BE REPLACED WITH A SIMILAR ONE SIZE FITS ALL. IN ORDER TO PRIORITIZE COST CONTAINMENT OR CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE CARE PARTICULARLY WHEN SO MANY LIVES ARE AT REST INSTEAD AS DH YES A SUGGESTED THE STATE SHOULD EVALUATE LENGTH OF STAY IN RELATION TO POSITIVE TREATMENT OUTCOMES AND FOCUS ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN TRANSITION OF CARE TO OTHER. I RECOVERY ORIENTED SERVICES FOR CLIENTS FOLLOWING RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. FINALLY WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THIRTY SEVEN COUNTIES PARTICIPATING IN THE DMZ ODS DEMONSTRATIONS AND ALTHOUGH THOSE THESE COUNTIES DO ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 90% OF THE STATE'S MEDICAID BENEFICIARY. THERE ARE STILL TWENTY ONE COUNTIES WHO ARE NOT YET ABLE TO OFFER THE MORE ROBUST CONTAINMENT CARE. ACCORDING TO TMZ- YES MOST OF THESE ARE RURAL COUNTIES SMALL COUNTIES. WHERE THEY HAVE SMALL POPULATIONS GEOGRAPHY WORKFORCE SHORTAGE AREAS AND LACK OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING TO DELIVER EVEN HOSPITAL LEVEL CARE. MUCH LESS SPECIALIZED AS YOU THESE SERVICES MANY OF THESE COUNTIES ALSO HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH PER CAPITA RATES OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. CALIFORNIA'S RURAL COUNTIES UNDERSTAND THE VALUE IN ADOPTING THE MANAGED CARE QUALITY STANDARDS OF THE DMZ OF YES AND IN SECURING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING TO EXPAND AS YOU SERVICES. BUT MANY CASES THEY ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL FISCAL RISK AND LACK OF NEW RESOURCES FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. OR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT RURAL HEALTH CARE. SERVICE DELIVERING COUNTER WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO GET TO FULL ADOPTION OF THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM BENEFIT CALIFORNIA MUST CONSIDER. ALLOCATING DEDICATED ON GOING FUNDING TO HELP SUPPORT CAPACITY BUILDING. IN THESE REMAINING COUNTIES TO BUILD UP THE FULL ARRAY AND DMC YES. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE A CULBERTSON OUR CEO OF TARZANA TREATMENT CENTERS. IF YOU BEGIN SIR YOU SHOULD SHOW UP ON CAMERA. OPERATOR IS HE HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. SEE THE WORD HELLO YES IS THE ANSWER. THANK YOU. WE ARE READY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MR SIMILAR. IT APPEARS WE'RE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. CAN WE TRY AND CONNECT AGAIN WITH ALBERT SIMILAR. WHILE WE WAIT FOR HIM TO RECONNECT I WILL BRING IT BACK UP AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBER QUESTIONS WE WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS FOLLOWED BY DOCTOR WITH. EUROPE WAS THE CHAIR. OF THE COUPLE QUESTIONS- ON ON THIS AND CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THE- THE RESIDENTIAL. TREATMENT EXTENSION FROM THE LOOKS LIKE THE THIRTY DAY EXTENSION NINETY DAYS BUT GOING TOWARDS A- MORE OF A MEDICALLY. NECESSARY MINNIS SAYS CITY IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD VERSUS TRYING TO- PUT ALL THOSE INTO AN AREA AND CERTAINLY WE SEE. WHERE THAT COULD BENEFIT- AND LOOKING AT. DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR- THOSE THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY- FOR LONGER TERM TREATMENT AND- THOSE. THAT ARE HERE BOTH CHAIRS KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN OUT SPOKEN AS FAR AS TRYING TO GET MORE RESOURCES LONGER TERM RESOURCES IN NINETY DAYS AND NINETY DAYS PLUS. FOR THESE TYPES OF THINGS AND BEING ABLE TO SEE HERE IN THE FIVE YEAR PLAN. THAT WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS HOPEFULLY LOOKING AT A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD BASED ON- THE TREATMENT OF MEDICALLY NECESSITY- THAT'S THERE. AND THEN THE NEXT QUESTION IS RESIDENTIAL LONG TERM. TREATMENT AND THE NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE I'M NOT SURE WHO COULD PICK IT UP I WAS THINKING THAT HOPING SOMEONE WOULD BRING IT UP IN THEIR PRESENTATION. IS A TRIBAL SERVICES THAT SOME HIGHLIGHTED HERE- IN OUR IN OUR PACKET. AND IT TALKS ABOUT PROVIDING THE ALLOWANCE- FOR- TREATMENT CULTURALLY TREATMENT AS FAR AS THE DIFFERENT- PLANTS AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE THERE. I WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN- RIVERSIDE- SEMOLINA COUNTY INDIAN HEALTH AS FAR AS IDENTIFYING THE PLANTS. THAT WERE THEN USED FOR THOSE THAT WERE BEING PRESCRIBED I'M SORRY I WONDER IF SOMEONE COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THAT- MISTER CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR IF SOMEONE CAN'T THEN WE WOULD REQUEST THAT INFORMATION. COMING TO OUR OFFICE. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP WITH THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE FIVE YEAR PLAN. HOW DOES THAT INCLUDE- THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND IS TALKING ABOUT HERE WORKING WITH IHS. SO IS IT THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES FROM THE FAIR- RECKON- TRIBES CAN. END UP- URBAN CLINICS- HERE IN THE OF. SO HOW ARE WE- GAUGING THAT DISCUSSION AND MOVING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE PART OF THE EQUATION AND PART OF THE BODY THAT'S GETTING. THESE RESOURCES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF WE COULD HAVE J. C. COOPER AS WELL AS DR CALLIE ANSWERED THE- QUESTIONS FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON THIS PLACE. I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO YOU I DR PIPER TO RESPOND. GREENTOWN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'M ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN TERMS OF TRIBAL PROVIDERS BUT WE ARE IN NEGOTIATION WITH THEM ASK ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN EXPAND OUR BENEFITS INCLUDE- CULTURALLY DEFINED CARE BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT WHEN. THAT MUSICAL RETREAT THEN AND I'LL FRIEDMAN IS PROVIDED BY PEOPLE FROM THE SAME CULTURE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT PERSON'S WALK OF LIFE AND ALSO LOOK AT SPECIFIC PRACTICES IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE- AGAIN THIS IS A PROPOSAL ON WORLD- I'M PLANNING TO WORK WITHIN THE FIFTY IF WE CAN AT. BENEFIT PLAN AND HEALTHCARE. FOR THE REST OF THE QUESTION RESIDENTS I DID AT THE THAT DOCTOR CAN SAID WE REASON WHEN THEY- THAT CHANGE THAT WE TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE ARE THE THAT MEDICALLY NOT. AND NOT- ARBITRARY DEFINE NUMBER THAT THAT THE YEAR BECAUSE THEY HAD SOME. NICE SHE MENTIONED THAT. PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS READY. FOR TREATMENT THE FIRST MOMENT THE ENTERTAINMENT AND THE CURRENT LIMIT ON TWO EPISODES MEANS THAT IF SOMEONE.TRIES AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE READY AND THEY ONLY HAVE ONE DAY STAYS AT THEIR HOME LOCKED UP FOR THREE MEN AND WE DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE WNNA MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED- BASED ON THEIR CONDITION. RESEARCHERS A COUPLE FOLLOW. OF MAY. UM ON AREAS LIKE FENTANYL AND OF THE SU. MEN HEALTH WE KNOW THE TRAVEL CAN. ARE EXPERIENCING THEM AT A HIGHER RATE THAN OTHER. GROUPS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY. REACHING THE COMMUNITIES- AND THERE'S INPUT. AND AS FAR AS THE- THE CULTURAL ASPECT AS FAR AS- INCLUDING OF THOSE THE PLANTS. ARE WE WORKING WITH TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT PLANTS. THAT PEOPLE USE- THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MY TRIBE SERRANO AND- WE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE WOULD USE DIFFERENT PLANS THAN MAYBE UP NORTH WHERE THE EUROPE PEOPLE. ARE AT SO HOPEFULLY AND CAN YOU- LET ME KNOW IF WE ARE WORKING WITH THE TRAVEL COMMUNITY IN THOSE REGIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THOSE PLANS ARE ACTUALLY PROPERLY DOCUMENTED. ABSOLUTELY WE- WE DO NOT THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE EXPANSIVENESS DEFINE TRIBAL PRACTICES AND IF WE'RE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH ALLOWING NATURAL HEALERS TO BE A MEDIC CAL THE LOCAL PROVIDERS AND DRUG MEDI CAL BERKELEY A LOT FOR ALLOWED TO. REMEMBER HOPEFULLY TO FIND PRACTICES THAT ARE NEW AND ABOVE ARE CURRENTLY ON SALE VIA SERVICES WOULD BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE TRIBAL. COMMUNITIES. THE FINAL PRACTICE. AND JUST ONE FOR CLOSE IF I MAY UM. MISTER HEARING DOCUMENT- CULTURAL PRACTICE FOR TRIBAL AND URBAN CLINICS- AND URBAN CLINICS- AND THEN THE DRIVE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. THE TRIBAL- CLINICS ON THE RESERVATION- FUNDED THROUGH IHS ARE WE TALKING OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FUNDING STREAM OR MECHANISM. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM WE WANT TO BE INCLUSIVE OF BOTH THE URBAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES SANDY- TRIBAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEIR NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT. SO WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE WITH. OKAY SO- IF WE CAN WE CAN STAY UPDATED ON ON HOW THOSE DIALOGUE AND HOW THAT CONVERSATION IS MOVING FORWARD- THROUGH OUR OFFICE TO THE CHAIRS. I WOULD DEEPLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU MISTER. DOCTOR WHAT YES ALSO THIS QUESTION- LA OUR DA- DEPARTMENT- FOR BOTH IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT SO THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM MODEL IS A COUNTY OPT IN MODEL SO WHEN THE STATE MAKES CHANGES TO THE SCOPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED IN IN THIS MODEL- ARE ARE THOSE COUNTIES THERE THE STATE COSTS ARE COUNTY CROSS. I CAN THINK OF. THE CARD THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD ACCORDING TO IT THE ONLY- WE UNDERSTAND THAT- UNDER THE ODS MODEL AND HISTORICALLY- THOSE ODS SERVICES WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY PART OF THE STATE PLAN DM C. SUITE OF SERVICES OFFERED ARE CURRENTLY PAID FOR- WITH- STATE GENERAL FUND AND SO. WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SERVICES WHICH ARE- YOU KNOW PART OF THAT SORT OF ORIGINAL SUI AND WHETHER OR NOT. THEY WOULD SORT FIND THE NON FEDERAL SHARE ASSOCIATED WITH- AND INCREASING UTILIZATION OF THOSE SERVICES- DUE TO THESE PROPOSED ODS CHANGES- IN REGARDS TO SORT OF THE OTHER ODS CHANGES- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY PERTAIN- THE DATE THEY ALL SORT OF PERTAINS TO- SERVICES FOR WHICH THE COUNTIES- YOU KNOW. BY THAT THE NON FEDERAL SHARE COSTS NOW. BUT HAPPY TO- TICKET TO THE- OF HAVE FOR THE COMING. THE COMMENTS ARE PRO IN THE THAT IT DOES VERY BASED ON THE- BENEFITS YEARS IT CODE AND SERVICES PROVIDED IN DMC IDEAS SO IT IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH. COUNTY FUNDED STATE FUNDED AND OF COURSE FEDERAL FUNDED- AND SO THISIS ONE THING TO NOTE THERE AND WE DO NOT FEEL LIKE THAT PROPOSED CHANGES- INDIAN CODIS AROUND THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT TRIGGER ON ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS JUST TO BE CLEAR IT'S REALLY AROUND CLARIFYING- HOW THE SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED- TO BENEFICIARIES IN RESTRICTING NOT ACCESS AND THEREFORE. WE ARE NOT. PROPOSING OR ASSUMING ANY INCREASE AT GENERAL FUND COSTS AT THIS TIME. AND IF I COULD ADD THAT WE DO AT THE- TO RUN DAY DOWN THAT THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE CAN THINK THAT THE SYSTEM. THAN TWO TIMES QUITE SMALL SO. THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT AKIN TO SITTING THERE WOULD BE AN INCREASE BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE IN NEED MORE HAN TWO EPISODES BUT THE VOLUME WOULD BE VERY SMALL AND- NOT THAT THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN BEFORE WE OUT- THIS PANEL I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK DR KELLY FOR HER QUICK ACTION AND THINKING ON OUR FEET WITH MARTIN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT IS A POWERFUL STORY AND REMINDER FOR SO MANY OF US JUST APPRECIATE YOUR COURAGE FOR SHARING THAT STORY WITH US HERE TODAY. HELLO THANK PANEL FOR AND- PASS IT OFF TO DOT ORG. THANK YOU DR RAM YOU ARE FIFTH PANEL IS ON WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PURSUE A FEDERAL WAIVER OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE IMD EXCLUSION FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ANALYSTS AGAIN WOULD BE THE- THE ADMINISTRATION.

AND CHAD COSTELLO WITH THE PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM CESSATION OF SOCIAL REHABILITATION AGENCIES. SO FIRST OFF THE ADMINISTRATION PLEASE. THANK YOU I'M STILL AS INDICATED IN THE CALLIN PROPOSAL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DEVELOPED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO POPULATIONS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE- ALSO KNOWN AS S. MY S. ET I'M SIMILAR TO THE FLEXIBILITY AS THE STATE HAS SECURED THROUGH THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT WE WERE JUST REFERRING TO. ARE VERY SIMILAR THIRTY- THAT WE ARE DRYING DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE I. ANTI SERVICES OUT THERE AS WELL I JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES ON THE ACS PROPOSES TO ASSESS COUNTY INTERESTED IN PURSUING THE WAIVER OPPORTUNITY- AS AS LONG AS THE SYSTEMS ARE OUR POSITION TO ACHIEVE AT THE REQUIRED GOALS AND OUTCOMES- THERE ARE EXTENSIVE AS CMS REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE FULFILLED IN ORDER TO. IMPLEMENT THIS WAIVER AND WE WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THOSE COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN MEET THAT OBLIGATION WHICH ONE OF THEM INCLUDES BUILDING OUT A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE- TO BENEFICIARIES INCLUDING COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES- AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE APPROPRIATE STEP DOWN TO THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING POSSIBLE- I WOULD NOTE AS SIMILAR WITH THE M. C. O. D. S. COUNTIES WOULD BE. HAVE TO VOLUNTARILY OPT IN TO PARTICIPATE- IN ORDER FOR IT TO CONTINUE TO BE BUDGET NEUTRAL SIMILAR TO- TNC ODS ADDITIONALLY- DH CS PROPOSES TO HIRE CONSULTANTS- TO WORK IT'S WITHIN OUR PROPOSED CAROLINE A B. C. P. THAT'S CURRENTLY PENDING FOR A REVIEW AS WELL I'M TO WORK WITH THE ACS AND INTERESTED COUNTIES TO DO A VERY REAL BUS A GAP ANALYSIS ON A CAPACITY ANALYSIS. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEET THE REQUIREMENTS- THAT CMS HAS PUT FORWARD IN THE WAY BURKE- PROPOSAL- AND WE WOULD NEED TO DO THAT PRIOR TO SUBMITTING OUR PROPOSAL TO CMS OF COURSE- I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT- THAT THIS ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN. DOLLAR UP- ALSO BE THE LEDGE. FOR CONSIDER- AROUND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO. INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSED- WOULD. ARE INSURED WE CAN- CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT TO THE COMMUNITY OF AN OUTPATIENT SERVICES AT NECESSARY. UNDERSCORES THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMITMENT TO BUILDING OUT OF THOSE NECESSARY SERVICES WHICH WE THINK IS REALLY CRITICAL TO HAVE PRIOR TO MOVING FORWARD WITH. AN AYE IN THE WAIVER REQUEST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT BENEFICIARIES WILL HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO YOU I'M COMMITTEE BASIN OUTPATIENT SERVICES- AND TO BE ABLE TO TRANSITION SMOOTHLY FROM AND I AM THESE DAYS- INTO- THE LOWEST LEVEL POSSIBLE AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO. OCCUR RECEIVE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY I TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT HOPEFULLY A FUTURE- IDEAS. AS WELL. AS THE REQUIREMENTS ARE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL IN REGARDS TO CMS REQUEST SO THE DEPARTMENT DOES- ANTICIPATE IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR TO BUILD THIS PROPOSAL. ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS STAKEHOLDERS. AS WELL- AND DH CS WOULD BE REQUIRED AS A CMS CURRENTLY REQUIRES THAT WITHIN ALL OF THEIR PIECES TO INCLUDE AN EVALUATION- SINCE IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE IN A LOVING FIFTEEN DEMONSTRATION THERE ARE MANDATORY. OF CRITERIA THAT WE DO HAVE TO MEET HE WOULD WORK WITH CMS. REGARDING THOSE ITEMS. AND LASTLY DH CS I'M HAS GENERAL AUTHORITY UNDER EXISTING LAW- AS NOTATED- TO BE ABLE TO SUBMIT A REQUEST OF THIS IS KIND HOWEVER. DCS IS PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO SEEK FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR ON THE MENTAL HEALTH I AM THE WAIVER AS A COMPONENT OF CALLIN. AND THIS CONCLUDES THE COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR SHIDA.

OF- PURSUING THESE THESE COUNTY PROPOSALS THAT COULD COULD COULD SORT OF CONSIDER REVISIONS TO THE TO THE TRAILER BILL ACCORDINGLY IN ORDER TO ANSWER SORT OF ENSURE THAT IT HAS MORE INPUT IN THE IN THE PROCESS- REGARDING REGARDING THE SPECIFIC WAIVER OPORTUNITY YOU KNOW WE DO FIND THAT THIS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHOICE ON THE PART OF THE LEGISLATURE- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW IN CHOOSING TO PURSUE THIS THIS PROPOSAL- GOT GOT SOME FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS STAKEHOLDERS WEIGHING THE PROS AND CONS OF THE- OF THE PROPOSAL AND ELECTED TO MOVE FORWARD AND- ACCORDINGLY YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO. YOU KNOW SORT OF CONDUCT ITS OWN WEIGHING UP THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PROPOSAL- AND- IN ITS CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT- WE DO FIND THE DECISION TO PURSUE THIS WAIVER REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING FUNDING WHICH IN CONCEPT COULD FREE UP COUNTY FUNDS TO FURTHER EXPAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE CAPACITY INCLUDING- INCLUDING AND WITHIN THE COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW AS NOTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO GAIN WAIVER APPROVAL FOR THIS PROJECT YOU KNOW THE STATE'S GONNA NEED TO MEET. A LIST OF FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS YOU KNOW INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAINING A CERTAIN COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY- AND WHETHER THE STATE IS IN A GOOD POSITION ACROSS THE BOARD TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS IS SORT OF UNCLEAR AT THE MOMENT- AS AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW TEACH THE S. IS INDICATED THAT IT'S PLANNING TO NO CONTRACT TO CONDUCT A GAP ANALYSIS LATER THIS YEAR. I'M WHICH CUTTING CONCEPTS SHEDS LIGHT ON WHAT THE STATE'S CURRENT CAPACITY FOR COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES IS AND IN TURN YOU KNOW REVEAL ANY. DEFICIENCIES THAT THE STATE WILL NEED TO ENTER PRESS IN ORDER TO GET WAIVER- AND ALSO WASN'T. BY THE TO. THERE A PROPOSED FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- TO ACQUIRE. HEALTH THE LEASE WHICH SPENT MAY HELP DEMONSTRATE. THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS WAIVER- YOU KNOW BUT GIVEN. I'M CONSIDERING ALL THESE THINGS YOU KNOW THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS STILL SORT OF NOT GET. POST A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR SORT OF HOW TO GAIN WAIVER APPROVAL FOR THIS- ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING- AND THOSE ARE SORT OF VALUES COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE AND THEN. HAPPY TO CORRECT FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NECESSARY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVING ON TO DR QUIST. GIVE ME A C. H. D. A IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S COMMITMENT UNDER CALLING TO PURSUE AN SMI S. C. D. DEMONSTRATION WAIVER TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR ACUTE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. AS MENTIONED FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DELIVERED IN MOST FACILITIES WITH MORE THAN SIXTEEN BEDS. THESE LARGE FACILITIES ARE NAMED INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE I AM HE'S AND SPENDS RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS AS WELL AS OTHERS. I'M REGARDLESS OF THIS EXCLUSION- MEDICARE ALL. IT ACCOUNT MANDATES COVERAGE FOR INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BENEFITS BUT THEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ACTUALLY GET REIMBURSED FOR SOME OF THE SOME OF THOSE- HOSPITALIZATIONS- WHEN WE WERE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE- WE PRETTY MUCH HAVE PREDOMINATELY ONLY ARE FREESTANDING PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS EXCEPT FOR THE THREE SIXTEEN BED PSYCHIATRIC HELP FACILITIES THAT THE COUNTY HAS- HAS CREATED HAVE CREATED. SO WE SITE THAT WERE REALLY STUCK WITH THESE LARGE FREESTANDING PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS SO AGAIN WHILE IS MANDATES COVERAGE FOR THESE IMPATIENT BENEFITS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET FEDERAL REVENUE. I'M CURRENTLY THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO SPENDS ITS ENTIRE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT ALLOCATION AND THEN SOME ON BEES I AM PLEASED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. THE RIGHT KIND OF FACILITIES. THE SMI SED DEMONSTRATION WAIVER OFFERS AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO SECURE THAT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT. IN EXCHANGE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GRAPH- DEMONSTRATION WHICH WOULD COMPEL BOTH THE STATE AND COUNTIES TO INVEST IN THE EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS WAS BEING DISCUSSED AROUND OPPORTUNITIES. TO STEP DOWN FROM THOSE STILL NEEDS. AS DISCUSSED IN THIS HEARING YEARS OF THE K. YEARS OF BEING CAPPED AT. THAT THE COST OF SERVICES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SHOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRICTED OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SAY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE CONTINUING COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH FACILITIES TO IMPLEMENT THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. APPLICATION AS GOOD AS CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE IMPACTS OF CO IN NINETEEN AND DEMING THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE CRITICAL TIME TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION- SHARE JUST BRIEFLY WHAT SOME LOCAL IMPACT WOULD BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY- WE LIKE I SAID WE SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THESE. I AM THE EXCLUDED FACILITIES AND A VERY CONSERVATIVE VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE MIGHT BE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WITH FEDERAL REVENUE TO BE ABLE TO FREE UP. AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF- REALIGNMENT FUNDS THAT WE COULD THEN REINVEST BACK INTO OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE ABLE TO BUY ME ROUGHLY. FIFTEEN HUNDRED OUT PATIENTS LOTS AND NOT WORK AND SIX HUNDRED ADDITIONAL OFFICE HE WILL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS LOTS IT WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO- WILL BE REINVESTED M. FURTHER BROADEN OUR OUTPATIENT. CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MOVING ON TO MR KITE. HELLO I'M STEVEN TYPE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AT THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS CALIFORNIA CHAIRS WOULD AND ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. NOT ONLY HAS LONG BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE I AM DEEP WAVER ROM THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO THE STATE ON DOWN TO OUR ACCOUNT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LISTENED TO US AND PROVIDED THE FLEXIBILITY FOR STATES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR A LOT. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE THAT THE AND MENTAL DISEASE R. NINETY. IS A FACILITY SUCH AS A HOSPITAL NURSING FACILITY OR OTHER INSTITUTION OF MORE THAN SIXTEEN BEDS. THAT PROVIDES DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT OR CARE OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES. SO WHAT IS THE EXCLUSION SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROHIBITED MEDICAID PAYMENT FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE NINETY. LET'S POLICY IS THE ONLY PART OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT PAY FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE TYPE OF ILLNESS YOU TREAT. I'M CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THAT THE APPLICATION AND I AM THE ROLE MOST DRAMATICALLY AFFECTS PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA AND OTHER SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE TEND TO FALL WITHIN THE TWENTY ONE TO SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLD AGE GROUP AND AS SUCH ARE DENIED FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION IN THEIR TREATMENTS. THE I AM THE ROLE IS DISCRIMINATORY. AND WORKS AGAINST THE PROVISION OF NECESSARY HEALTH CARE FOR YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED ADULTS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL. CREATING A WHOLE THE CONTINUITY OF CARE AT THIS CRITICAL LEVEL. THE IMPACT OF THIS EXPLOSION S. CLEAR APPROXIMATELY ONE EIGHT VISITS TO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS INVOLVED MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE CONDITIONS ARE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE OFTEN NOT EQUIPPED TO HELP PEOPLE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT STAFF OFTEN HAD NO PLACE TO SEND A PERSONAL CRISIS BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS IN THE U. S. WHICH IS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY. BECAUSE THERE ARE OFTEN NO CONDITION BEDS AVAILABLE. PEOPLE CRISIS OR AUTHOR FROM EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. LEFT TO DEAL WITH THEIR ILLNESSES ON THEIR OWN OR TRANSFER TO A FAR AWAY COUNTY. AND ALSO THEN WHEN PEOPLE DON'T GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT THEY CAN END UP IN JAIL OR ON THE STREETS OR IN A CONFRONTATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADING TO WORSE OUTCOMES FOR THE PERSON. GREATER PAIN FOR THEIR LOVED ONES AND A HIGHER COST TO THE STATE. AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS IS LITERALLY LIFE AND DEATH FOR OUR FAMILY. SO WHAT IS THE WAIVER IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CMS ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE THAT INVITED STATES TO APPLY FOR SECTION ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER. OF FEDERAL ANTI CAN EXCLUSION FOR SERVICES WITH ADULTS OR ADULTS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS REST OF MIND. OR CHILDREN WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE OR ASKING THE PURPOSE OF THIS DEMONSTRATION IS TO TEST WHETHER INCREASING ACCESS TO ACUTE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC CARE. ONE REDUCES RESILIENCE ON OUR I'M SORRY REDUCES RELIANCE ON EMERGENCY ROOMS AND TO IMPROVE CONNECTIONS OUTPATIENT COMMUNITY TREATMENT. THE WAIVER WOULD ALLOW STATES TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES DURING SHORT TERM STAYS FOR CUTE CARE AND PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS OR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SETTINGS THAT QUALIFIES ID'S. IN MEETINGS IN CALLS BUT NOT A CALIFORNIA HAS HAD WITH OUR MEMBERS THE QUESTION WE GET ASKED THE MOST IS WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE I AM DEEP WAVER AND WHY HASN'T THE STATE LIFE OF THIS YET. SO I CAN SAY THAT ON THE CALIFORNIA WAS OVERJOYED WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ANNOUNCED THAT AS PART OF THE STATE'S KELLY PROPOSAL. INTENDED TO APPLY FOR THIS WAY FOR. OUR OFFICIAL STATE ON THE WAY TO. IS THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS SHOULD HAVE TO FULL RANGE TREATMENT. OPTIONS PSYCHIATRIC CARE CAN BE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT SOME PEOPLE ST. UPDATING I AM THE EXPLOSION TO ALLOW FOR SHORT TERM STAYS IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS. HELP STRENGTHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND PROVIDES PEOPLE WHO RELY ON MEDICAID WITH MORE TREATMENT OPTIONS. ADDITIONALLY THE GOALS AND MILESTONES THE WAIVER ALIGNED WITH NON THESE PRINCIPLES. THESE GOALS AND MILESTONES- THAT SITS REQUIRED TO MEET UNDER THE SWAY BAR PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT WE AREN'T RETURNING TO THE DARK DAYS OF MASS INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND FOR ST. SOME OF THESE CALLS INCLUDE REDUCE UTILIZATION REDUCED PREVENTABLE READMISSIONS IMPROVED AVAILABILITY OF CRISIS STABILIZATION SERVICES. IMPROVE ACCESS TO COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND. IMPROVE CARE COORDINATION. SOME OF THE MILES. INCLUDE OVERSIGHT WHICH INCLUDES PROCESS TRANSITION PLANNING. HOUSING AND BETTER INTEGRATION WITH PREVENTION SERVICES. AND WE'VE SEEN SOME SIGNS OF SUCCESS TODAY CMS HAS APPROVED THE I AND E. WEBER FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND JUST ONE STATE VERMONT AND FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN SEVENTEEN STATES WHERE IT'S ALREADY IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR BENEFICIARIES FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE OF VIRGINIA HAS SHOWN IN ITS EARLY RESULTS THE I. N. D. S. U. D. RIVER. ACTUALLY 39% DECREASE OPIOID RELATED EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND I 31% DECREASE AND SUBSTANCE USE RELATED ER VISITS OVERALL. SOME CLOSING. THIS OPPORTUNITY OFFERS HOPE TO MANY OF OUR MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN DESPERATE FOR MORE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THEMSELVES NUMBER ONE. NOT ONLY STRONGLY URGES THE STATE TO USE THIS FLEXIBILITY FROM CMS TO IMPROVE CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR KITE- MOVING ONTO CHAD COSTELLO. IT'S. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS WOODEN ARAMBULA MEMBERS OF THE MIDEAST AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO ALL THE PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION SOCIAL REHABILITATION AGENCIES KASRA ONE OF THOSE ARTICLES THAT CONTAIN WITHIN THE CALIBRATION OF CALLING ON PARTNERS HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO APPLY TO CMS FOR WAIVER TO THE IDEA EXCLUSION RAIN CHECK OURSELVES AND THE PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR CANCER WHICH IS COMPRISED OF TWENTY FIVE MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE PROVIDE SERVICES OF THE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE IS THE CALIFORNIA HALFWAY HOUSE ASSOCIATION CANCER HAS A RICH HISTORY OF PROVIDING PERSON CENTERED RECOVERY AND REHABILITATION FOCUSED VOLUNTARY COMMITTEE BASED ALTERNATIVES TO LOTS OF VOLUNTARY TREATMENT AS AN ASSOCIATION CANCERS BUT OF ALL THE COUNTY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND IT'S BEEN A PRESS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT WANTED TO LIST THEM ON FROM THE SUCCESSFUL CALPERS TO THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE PROMISE OF MANY OF THE MULTITUDE PROPOSALS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD HOLD FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND THOSE WE SERVE. SO PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE FOLLOWING GETTING A CATION OF A LACK OF SUPPORT FOR THE OVERALL COUNTY NEVER WAS A LACK OF ADMIRATION TREMENDOUS WORK DEPARTMENT STAFF HAVE DONE AND THEN APPRECIATION FOR THE WORK THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO DO. TO BRING. IT SUCCESS. HAVING SAID THAT. CANCER IS STRONGLY. TO ANY TO UNDO THE PROHIBITION AGAINST YOU MEDICAID. TO FOUR CATEGORY FACILITIES IN THIS IS A TEACH FOR HELICES. OTHER THERE IS A PEACE. LAST COUNT- OPPOSE. THE EXPLOSION. THE FEDERAL DOT ROOM. X. OF I. AS A IMPORTANT BULWARK AGAINST. THE SEE AS THE- CONSERVING FOR PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS FROM OTHER SYSTEMS. WITH INVOLUNTARY INPATIENT CARE UNLESS YOU'RE SERIOUS PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES THAT MAKE DOING SO UNATTRACTIVE. WHY IS THIS. FIRST THE SIGNIFICANT GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY MANY TIMES MAKES IT EASIER TO OPEN NINETY TYPE FACILITY. OR UTILIZE EXISTING LICENSED FACILITIES. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING INVOLVED IN A FEW PROTRACTED MESSY EFFORTS TO LOCATE THE LOTTERY PROGRAM TO COMMUNITIES. IT TAKES POLITICAL COURAGE TO STAND UP TO PASSIONATELY UPSET CONSTITUENTS. LEVEL COURAGE AS FAR LESS LIKELY TO MANIFEST ITSELF WHEN IT EASIER TO LOCATE. I AM DETECTED SO IT CAN BE OPENED. IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS CAP. SO THIS IS WHAT MANY ADVOCATES DEMANDING OR LEAST SEEM TO BE TO- GOING TO MAKE LISTINGS WHICH YOU ARE AWARE AND IN THE PUBLIC ARE UNAWARE OF OTHER TREATMENT OPTIONS COULD SHOULD BE OFFERED. THESE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS DISCIPLINE IT RELIEVES HELP AND ACCESS TO CARE RESIDENTS. IN THIS INTERVIEW TO ME ACCESS TO LAWCENTER AFRICA SLOWS. CASUALLY SAID MUCH OF WHAT IS INTRODUCED IN MAN FOR I AM THE TYPE THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED LESS RESTRICTIVE. REHABILITATION FOCUSED ACTUALLY COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES. SUCH AS THOSE OUTLINED WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION FIFTY SIX FIFTY SIX SEVENTY. TWO FIFTY SIX SEVENTY SIX- THE APPLICATION FOR A POTENTIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE NINETY EXCLUSION WAIVER WOULD MARK AN IMPORTANT AND WE'LL GET IT REGRETTABLE DEPARTURE FOR CALIFORNIA'S FORTY PLUS YEAR COMMITMENT. TOWARD DEVELOPING VOLUNTARY KEENLY BASED ALTERNATIVES TO HOSPITAL INSTITUTIONAL CARE SETTINGS AS ORIGINALLY EXPRESSED A CALIFORNIA'S COMMITTEE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SYSTEM HAPPENED NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. I AM THESE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS LEFT THE SAUDIS. ISSUES AND IDEAS ARE ALMOST NEVER THERE VOLUNTARILY. INDIVIDUALS FIND THEMSELVES IN NINETY SETTING AS PART OF A LONG TERM INVOLUNTARY. HOLDS SOME KIND SUGGEST CONSERVATORSHIP. I AM THESE ARE NOT BAY. THEIR COMMUNITY LOCATED EVERY FACILITY OR PROGRAM IS LOCATED THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S A POLICY HOSPITALS LOCATED COMMITTEE OF NORWALK WITH THOSE WHO RECEIVED SERVICES THERE ARE NOT IN ANY WAY PARK LACK OF THE COMMUNITY ARE LAW. OFFICE BUILDINGS ARE DESIGNED. HAVE THE STILL HERE WITH THEIR PATIENTS NO MATTER WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO LOOK AT IT. THE ANYWAY FOR APPLICATION WOULD FLY IN THE FACE THE SUPREME COURT'S NOT NINETY NINE. ON VERSUS ELSIE. WHICH ESSENTIALLY THAT ENDED WITH THIS HAVE THE TO LIVE IN COMMUNITY RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONS LAST WEEK. THE PROPOSAL APPLICATION MAKES NO SENSE OF THE LARGER CALLIN YOU SHOULD. AS A MEMBER OF THE CALENDAR HERE HEALTH WORKER I WAS AT THE SESSION BACK IN TWENTY TO SEE THAT REQUIRE FOR NINETY EXCLUSION WAS NAY PART OF CAL. NATALIE OF MY ORGANIZATIONS UP JUST OR- BECAUSE OF A WE KNOW OF THE CONTEXT DOUBLES KALANK. I WAS RELIEVED THAT THROUGH OF RECEIVING FEEDBACK FROM OPEN. IT SEEMS HIGHEST VERSION WEBER THE DRAW CAL ONLY BE SURPRISE AGAIN WHEN IT MADE A REAL IN THE TWO TWENTY ONE. REPLIES COUNTY WHICH BRINGS ME. BEFORE YOU HEAR. THE I. NIECES OR WHATEVER MAKES LITTLE.

BE WHERE. MEETING REQUIREMENTS BY C. TO LEGALLY. TO MATCH. SEARCH OF THE PROPOSAL TO APPLY FOR NINETY STUDENT WAIVER CONTAINS IN THE CALENDAR SHOULD HAVE SHOULD BE. IS IT I NEED IN ORDER TO TRACK FOR THE BUT SHALL BUSINESS BIT LATE CALENDAR. MOREOVER THE ELIMINATION IS PART IT THE OVER USE THE BALL CARE. CALIFORNIA BACKWARD NOT FORWARDS ONLY UNDER MY HERE'S A EFFORT TO HELP WITHIN OUR OF ALL KING BASED. IN THE OF ALL. TO THE MORAL LEGAL AND CLOSE STATES STEP OF MAINSTREAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I APPRECIATE ALL THE ALL THE PANELS HERE IN I THINK WE HAVE SOME- PLEASE. GO DR RANGAN. THANK YOU MIGHT QUESTIONS TODAY WILL BE FOR THE I. TO- HAVE A STINK ABOUT IN THE ONE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HASN'T OF CALIFORNIA'S I AM THE WAY FOR WOULD YOU LIKE THAT THE INCREASE IN FEDERAL TO RESULT IN MORE I AM DE QUE. FOR WILL IT FREE OF COUNTY FOR FROM CA BASED CARE CENTER WHAT I'M ASKING IS LISTEN HELP US MOVE AWAY FROM MORE AND CARE AND TOWARDS MORE AND BETTER CAN YOU BASED. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS. IN ORDER FOR A COUNTY TO EVEN BE ABLE TO- BE AVAILABLE TO USE THE I AM THE WAIVER TO OPT IN AND SUBMIT THE APPLICATION TO GO LIVE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO OUR COMMUNITY BASED AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A CONTINUUM. THE GOAL OF THE I AND B. WAIVER IS TO ACTUALLY- OVER TIME BUILD OUT THAT CONTINUUM REDUCE THE I AM THE LENGTH OF STAY- BY ENSURING THAT THERE IS APPROPRIATE- COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AVAILABLE- WE WOULD MAKE. VERY CLEAR AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT INTENDING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE ABLE TO- GET I AM THE SERVICES- HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A ROLL UP FOR SOME I AM THE SERVICES BUT IN THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPACE AND SPECIFICALLY THE SPECIAL. TEAM MENTAL HEALTH SPACE BUT WE WANT TO BUILD OUT THE CONTINUUM OF SERVICES- INCLUDING THE OUT PATIENT- AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND HAVE THAT FULL CONTINUUM. WE ALSO PLAN ON REALLY ADDRESSING SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES WITHIN. OUR PROGRAM AROUND THE JUSTICE INVOLVED IN ENSURING THAT THERE ARE ADEQUATE SERVICES BOTH FROM A RE ENTRY AND A DIVERSION POINT IF- MADE AVAILABLE. TO INDIVIDUALS WITH THIS I AM THE WAY BURKE- AND IT'S FAR GREATER THAN JUST DRYING DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE DO ANTICIPATE AND EXPECT THE COUNTIES THAT PARTICIPATE- IN THIS I. ANTI WOULD REINVEST ANY OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS INTO ARGENTINE YOU'D- GROWTH IN. REGARDS TO EVIDENCE BASED MODELS ON THE OUT PATIENT FRONT I'M AN ADDITIONAL. SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. OKAY THANK YOU- CYBER COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- AND SO COULD BE ARGUED THE IN DR- SO I'M CURIOUS WHY WHAT IT HAVE TO DO DIFFERENT IN ORDER THE STATE TO SEE CAN I AM THE WAIVER FOR MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO ARE THERE SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE IN REGIONS OF THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE. I COULD GO TO. EITHER YOU J. C. OR DR QUIST I DO YOU NEED ME TO REPEAT IT. YES PLEASE SO WHAT WILL COUNTIES HAVE TO DO DIFFERENTLY IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO SEE CAN I AM THE WAIVER FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO REALLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS THAT I MAY WANT TO KICK IT KELLY IN REGARDS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE FULL LIST OF ALL. THE REQUIRED. BUT THERE SEEM AS DOES HAVE A LIVE OF. BOTH PRIME FORTY. THEY HAVE TO REDUCE I AM I AM DEALING OF STAY TO- HELLO AMOUNT OF STAY. BY HAVING THE FALCONS OF. OUTPATIENT COMMUNITY SERVICE- THEY ALL ARE GOING TO HAVE RICK. OR QUALITY IN IN THE SO ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT REQUIRE. THEY HAVE TO TAKE IN THE TO THOSE SERVICES I'M BUT LET ME PASS AND SEE- DOCTOR FOR HOW ADDITION D. AND- TO- SOME OF THEIR- WITH IN THE FEDERAL. A WAIVER THE THEY WOULD HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO. DRAW THOSE. THANK RIGHT THANK YOU AND GAVE THE YES ON THE GOVERNMENT WAS IN CAT JEFF BIG IT MANY IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT DRAW FACING COUNTY MORE AMBITIOUS OF THAT THEY WE WOULD HAVE TO DENNIS AT STATE AND PROTECT COUNTY WOULDN'T A DEMO THAT THERE REALLY UP FULL COMMUNITY BASED- CAN OF IN THE THERE IS RIGOROUS. ARE THEY GETTING HELP FACILITY AND THEN. THEY'LL TAKE BETTER- CRISIS RESIDENTS EITHER. THAT ARE. ACCEPTING OUR LOW LEVELS OF CARE OFTEN. TO KEEP IN MIND IT TAKES SEVENTEEN COULD BE CONSIDERED AND I AM DAVID NOT THAT. IN PRIDE. WE WILL BE WORKING WITH COUNTY TO MAKE SURE THE THIS SO THAT'S PROMISE ARTICLE WHICH IS ENSURE THAT IF SOME SHOWS A THE PMR. TO AND ACUTE CRISIS. THE ANSWER IS NO TO DISCHARGE HOME OR GO TO JAIL THAT THERE THAT ABOUT THEY'LL SOME NEEDS LEVEL OF CARE DISABLE IF THE- OR TO DO REAL- COURTNEY FOR THE INTENSE OUT. I'M DOCTOR QUIT THEY ALSO HAVE SOME- ADDITIONAL. THE PROSPECTUS. SACRAMENTO HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED- THIS WAS SAY THANK YOU AGAIN TO- PANEL FIVE. OF FOR THEIR- THEIR TESTIMONY TODAY AND WITH THAT WE WERE GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR SIX PANEL. DOCTOR RANDY WILL TAKE OVER FROM HERE. FOUR SIX PANEL WE WILL BE ADDRESSING THE PROPOSED INTEGRATION OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. WE WILL HAVE THREE SPEAKERS DIRECTOR LIKE PORN GZ COOPER AND DR KELLY PLEASE BEGIN. SO DO YOU SEE S. IS PROPOSING ADMINISTRATIVE INTEGRATION OF THOSE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES INTO ONE BIG HELP MANAGED CARE PROGRAM- THIS PROPOSED THAT PROPOSAL IS DISTINCT FROM THE FULL INTEGRATION PLAN WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THAT WE DO TRY TO SEPARATE THIS IS AROUND- INTEGRATION OF BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES NOT NECESSARILY. THE FULL INTEGRATION WHICH I KNOW WE WILL GET TO LATER- WHICH TALKS ABOUT INTEGRATING PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ORAL- INTO A COMPREHENSIVE MANAGED CARE PLAN SO SEPARATING THOSE TWO- APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH. ILLNESS HAVE CO OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES OR NEEDS- AND THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE TRULY BENEFIT FROM INTEGRATED MENTAL HEALTH AN STD I TREATMENT. THE STATE COVERS A MEDIC CAL AS YOU DEON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH SEPARATE COUNTY CONTRACTS TODAY- WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR COUNTIES AND CONTRACTED PROVIDERS TO OFFER INTEGRATED TREATMENT INDIVIDUALS WITH CO OCCURRING DISORDERS. OF FOR EXAMPLE COUNTIES ARE SUBJECT TO USE- TWO SEPARATE ANNUAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT A SEPARATE PAYMENT- POST PAYMENT CHART AUDITS AS WELL AS ALL OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THEIR CONTRACTS SEPARATING BETWEEN THE GOP INCLUDING SEPARATE REIMBURSEMENT COST REPORTING METHODOLOGIES THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS IN THIS HEARING. I'M JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES- IN MANY OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE ADMINISTRATIVELY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- YOU KNOW INTEGRATED- BUT WE STILL OLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO TWO SEPARATE CONTRACTS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY HAD TO STAY SEPARATE FOR THE PURPOSES. OF MEETING STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AS CURRENTLY- IN THEIR CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE SEPARATE PROCESS EASE OF PROVIDERS OFFERING INTEGRATED TREATMENT TO A MEDICARE BENEFICIARY MUST DOCUMENT AS YOU D. TREATMENT SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE SEPARATE. FROM A MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SERVICE- WHICH WE REALLY. FEEL IS REALLY UNNECESSARY AND IF WE HAVE BETTER INTO CARE. DELIVERY SYSTEM WE DO THINK IT WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT ARE BETTER- I WOULD NOTE ARE CURRENTLY COUNTY TO PROVIDE IN ADMINISTER THESE BENEFITS UNDER A SINGLE CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES ALL ARE ARE SEPARATE- THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INTEGRATE- THOSE SERVICES UNDER ONE. COUNTY PROGRAM WITH ONE COUNTY CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO IT TO NOTATE HERE- WE DO ANTICIPATE THIS EFFORT WILL- IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR BENEFICIARIES TO CORD NEEDED TREATMENT ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE- I MAKING IT EASIER FOR PROVIDERS TO OFFER. INTEGRATED CARE. ADDITIONALLY YOU- AN ADDITIONAL KIND OF GOAL AND BENEFIT WOULD BE TO REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND FISCAL BURDENS FOR THE COUNTIES PROVIDERS AND STATE THAT IS. SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A BENEFIT HEREBY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTS AS AS MENTIONED AB IS BOB- ALTHOUGH DACA'S COULD ACCOMPLISH- ADMINISTRATIVELY WE DO PREFER TO INCLUDE THE THIS IN THE CALENDAR FOR THE BILL. TO CLEARLY SIGNAL THE FUTURE REQUIREMENT FOR COMBINED COUNTY CONTRACTS- INTO EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND REQUIRE- OF THE ASSOCIATED PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND COUNTY UP CONSULTATION DURING THE UPCOMING CAL IN TERM- WITH THE WORK. INVOLVED INTEGRATE THE TWO CONTRACTS IT IS QUITE SUBSTANTIAL JUST TO BE CLEAR IN REGARDS TO- THEM BEING VERY SEPARATE TODAY- SO DH CS DOES BELIEVE THIS WORK WE NEED TO BE DONE OVER THE FIVE YEARS OF THE CURRENT WAVE BURKE- AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD FOCUS WORKING WITH THEIR COUNTIES. ON THOSE BUILDING BLOCKS OF INTEGRATION I TO DO IT OVER TIME SO IT'S NOT OVERWHELMING FOR THE COUNTY TO MOVE INTO A SINGLE INTEGRATED CONTRACT- AND THEN IN THE NEXT- WAIVER PERIOD STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IS WHEN WE WOULD EXECUTE- THE FIRST SINGLE CONTRACT WITH COUNTIES TO PROVIDE BOTH. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND A CD SERVICES IN A COMBINED CONTRACTS- SO THIS WILL CONCLUDE- THE COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT HOW. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WITH THAT. DOT KELLY. THANK YOU DOCTOR ON DR WOULDN'T AND RUNNING KELLY THE HEALTHCARE FOR SAN YOU KNOW IN THE PRESIDENT C. B. H. T. F. K. B. EVER HOPEFULLY WE STRONG SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL TO INTEGRATE OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PLANS AND WHILE WE OFTEN DISCUSS THE DESIRE TO SEE GREAT GREATER CLINICAL INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL ON HERE HOW WE STILL ARE NOT AT A POINT WHERE WE HAVE REAL INTEGRATION BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. TODAY COUNTIES IN OUR CONTRACTED COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS WHO WISH TO PROVIDE CLINICALLY INTEGRATED SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE CO OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER AFTER DO SO WHILE MAINTAINING REALLY STRICT COMPLIANCE TO THE STATE SETS A REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT'S TO SEPARATISTS US MEANT TO SEPARATE TREATMENT PLANS TO SELL CLAIMS TO DIFFERENT STOPPING PATTERNS AND MULTIPLE PROGRAM INSIGHT CERTIFICATION OR LICENSURE. AND SO FOR THOSE BENEFICIARIES WITH CO OCCURRING MENTAL. HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. PROVIDERS MUST DO THE WHAT CAN BE. THE CLIENTS MENTAL ILLNESS OR THEIR S. U. D. WILL BE THEIR PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS NECESSARY TO AVOID THIS ALLOWANCES AND TO SECURE REIMBURSEMENT. OPERATIONALLY FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WE MUST ALSO STAND UP DISTINCT DATA COLLECTION COMPLIANCE REVIEW AND NETWORK ADEQUACY COMPLIANCE STRUCTURES. SO KEEPING WITH THE OVERALL THEMES ACCOUNT AIMS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFORMS WE ARE SO LOOKINGFORWARD TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR RULES AND PROCESSES TO BE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE. MODERN AND TO REMOVE THESE OUTDATED SERVICE BARRIERS WHICH DO NOT MAKE SENSE FOR PROVIDERS. AND THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. AND ALTHOUGH THESE CHANGES ARE LONG OVERDUE AS JC JUST STATED REMOVING THE ARTIFICIAL ADMINISTRATIVE WALL WE PUT UP BETWEEN. SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH AND S. U. D. WILL TAKE TIME. THE GOAL OF CAL AIM IS TO TRANSITION- COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS TO A SINGLE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTRACT BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND THIS EFFORT MUST BE COORDINATED WITH OTHER CAL INITIATIVES. IN ORDER TO FOR EXAMPLE CREATE A SINGLE STANDARDIZED AND INTEGRATED SCREENING TOOL. TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT AND A LINE REQUIREMENTS FOR CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION WHICH IS ARE VERY DIFFERNT NOW TO ALLOW PROVIDERS TO USE A SIMPLIFIED CLIENT CENTERED PROBLEM LAST RATHER THAN A COMPLIANCE CENTER TREATMENT PLAN. SO WE KNOW SOME CHANGES WILL BE STRAIGHT FORWARD CURRENTLY SOME COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY INTEGRATED BENEFICIARY LINES ALTHOUGH THEY MUST OBSERVE A DISTINCT DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS. I COUNTIES WILL ALSO WELCOME PERFORMING A SINGLE ANNUAL EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION COMPLIANCE REVIEW RATHER THAN THE TWO THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. OVER THOSE PLANS LIKE MINE AND SAMPOERNA DINO COUNTY WE'VE ALREADY LAID SOME SIGNIFICANT GROUNDWORK FOR THIS SHIFT BY. DEVELOPING WORKAROUNDS TO SUPPORT GREATER CLINICAL INTEGRATION AND WE'RE HOPING DHS WILL WORK WITH US TO ALLOW FOR AN EARLIER PHASED IN APPROACH. BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES OUR AIM IS NOT TO JUST DO THE ADMINISTRATIVE INTEGRATION ASSEMBLY STREAMLINE OUR OWN BURDEN AS PLANS AND PROVIDERS. BUT TO REALLY DESIGN THIS ADMINISTRATIVE INTEGRATION INTO A WAY THAT WILL. COMPEL MORE CLINICALLY INTEGRATED MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE TO SERVICES AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL AND HOPE THAT. THE STATE WILL APPROACH THIS EFFORT. WITH IN MIND BECAUSE ONE OF. IN NEED PRESENTS TO ME AS A CLINICIAN. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR SCHIZOPHRENIA. AND THEIR HEROIN ADDICTION USING ONE CHART. ONE METHOD OF ASSESSING ONE CLINIC SITE AND ONE CLINICIAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR KELLY WILL BRING IT. BACK UP FOR ANY MEMBER QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY. QUESTION I'M GOING TO THIS WITH ONE WITH WHERE YOU AND OFF DR IF I COULD BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS NOT AN SIMPLY TO EMIGRATE. BUT US TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP AND SORRY HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ABOUT WHAT REAL INTEGRATION WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR A PATIENT AS COMPARED TO WHERE THE WORLD IS TODAY IN TERMS OF THE CLINICAL INTEGRATION WITH WHICH YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING ABOUT. SO CLINICALLY WOULD BE GREAT IF OUR PATIENTS TO COME JUST TO OUR ONE SITE AND RECEIVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES THAT WE CAN. FREELY WRITE IN THEIR CHART THAT THEY HAVE LIKE A JUST STATED AS AN EXAMPLE SCHIZOPHRENIA. AND METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE AND THAT WE COULD TREAT WHICHEVER WAS THE ISSUE OF THAT DAY CURRENTLY WE CANNOT DO THAT CURRENTLY WHEN A PATIENT COMES IN WHO HAS SCHIZOPHRENIA I SEE THEM IN MY MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC. AND THEN I WILL MAKE SURE THEY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT IN MY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CLINIC A DIFFERENT DAY THEY WILL GET THAT SERVICE TWO DIFFERENT CHARTS. WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE A RELEASE OF INFORMATION FOR MY TO CLINICIANS WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY THE SAME ENTITY TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER'S CHART. SO IF WE HAD A MORE INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE- AND- DONE SOME. PILOT PROGRAMS HERE IN SAN BENITO COUNTY WHETHER INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN OR MANAGED CARE PLAN WE TRIED PUTTING ON A- MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN AND AN ADDICTION COUNSELOR IN PRIMARY CARE. CAN WORK SO WELL WE PUT THE PRIMARY CARE NURSE IN OUR CLINIC AND IT'S BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. IN THE COMORBIDITIES OF OUR CLIENTS SPECIFICALLY REDUCTIONS AND THEIR A. ONE C. LEVEL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE DIABETES WHICH IS A BIG PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS WE'VE SEEN A DECREASE IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS. AND A DECREASE IN PSYCHIATRIC INPAIENT VISITS THAT JUST TELLS US OUR DATA TELLS US THAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. ARE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION DOCK- PATIENTS OFTENTIMES FEEL SAFER COMING TOGETHER SERVICES AT OUR CLINICS SO BEING ABLE TO COORDINATE THAT INTO ONE CLINIC PURSES TWO. THAT ARE OVERSEEN BY THE SAME ENTITY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE ADDITIONALLY- IF WE HAVE A GREAT CLINICAL PICTURE THAT SHOULD MAKE THE ADMINISTRATIVE PIECE MUCH EASIER AND FAR. LESS BURDENSOME THAN IT IS FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU DR KING FOR VISION WITH THE WE WILL HOLD ISSUES. OPEN AND MOVE ON TO A SEVEN. THANK YOU VERY DR RAMYA THE NEXT. PANEL IS DISCUSSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REGIONAL CONTRACTING. AND OB TWO SPEAKERS ESSENTIALLY- THE ADMINISTRATION- AND- THIS COOPER I ASSUME AND THEN- MICHELLE CABRERA THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ACCOUNTING COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. SO PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISS COOPER. THANK YOU I'M SO GIVEN THE- DIVERSE THE INSIDES OF COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON THIS PER PER PROPOSALS REALLY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE AN INSURER- WE ARE CLEAR WITH- OUR ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN AND ALLOW FOR REGIONAL CONTRACTING. OF EXISTING A LAW AUTHORIZES COUNTIES TO DEVELOP REGIONAL APPROACH IS TO ADMINISTER AND DELIVER A SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS TODAY- AND YOU SEE THIS IS REALLY JUST ENCOURAGING COUNTIES THROUGH THE CLIPERS YOU DEVELOP REGIONAL APPROACH IS TO ADMINISTER AND DELIVER ON THESE SERVICES AND MEDICARE OUT WHEN APPROPRIATE AT AND WHERE BENEFICIAL FOR THOSE COUNTY IS. A TO DO SO- ALSO LOOKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A VARIETY OF OPTIONS INCLUDING JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY- TO OPERATE SUCH SERVICES AND MULTI COUNTY REGIONS POOLING RESOURCES TO CONTRACT A WITH ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ARE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS- OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT AS THEY SEE FIT- IT REALLY LOOKING AT EVEN SOME PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL MEDICARE MEDICARE PLANS TO CREATE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES ACROSS. MULTIPLE COUNTIES WE HAVE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF- YOU KNOW BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER UP PLANS- THAT UPON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I FEDERAL FINAL RULE AROUND MANAGED CARE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITIES AND BURDENS HAVE BEEN HARD ON SOME COUNTIES ESPECIALLY SMALL COUNTIES- AND BY DOING THE COMING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IT MAY ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT- THAT. BOTH FISCAL PRESSURE AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN- ON THOSE COUNTIES AND SO JUST SHOWING OUR SUPPORT HERE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE SMALL RURAL FRONTIER COUNTIES- AND COUNTIES WHICH YOUR POPULATION CENTERS- OF ALL COMPLIMENTARY COMPLIMENTARY RESOURCES THAT NEED TO BE AYE CONSIDERING THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THOSE COUNTIES TO OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- TO HELP DEVELOP REGIONAL CONTRACTS. AND ESTABLISH- ANY INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS FILLED THEY AND THAT CAN OUR CALL THIS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISS COOPER. I AFTERNOON- ABOUT THE AND WOOD AND MEMBERS MACHEL EXECUTOR DIRECTOR THE COUNTY HEALTH DIRECTOR THE- AND AS G. LEADS. COUNTY HEALTH PLAN OUR VERY EXCITED TO LOOK FORWARD TO OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE ACROSS THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND IN TERMS OF THE BACK AND HEALTH PLANS FUNCTIONS- THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR- BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE PAYMENT REFORM CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TO BE MEDICAL NECESSITY CHANGES THAT FEDERAL. COUNTY WILL NEED TO- ENTIRELY RETOOL THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS BEHIND HOW THEY FUNCTION AS PLANNED AND THAT IS ON TOP OF THE FINAL GOAL- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE CONTINUING TO OF ALL- WITH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EACH B. F. AND FELT. THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT CAN BE HEALTH PLANS OF ALL SIZES ARE EXCITED ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER LEVERAGE ECONOMIES OF SCALE ACROSS THE STATE- TO BETTER STANDARDIZED OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS INCLUDING THROUGH JOINT PURCHASING AS WELL AS- EXPLORING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR- AT A MULTI COUNTY- ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD FOR EXAMPLE ALL OF THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE- COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOPE DIRECTORS. PRIOR MADE THE STRATEGIC DECISION WITH SUPPORT FROM- THEIR THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTAL SERVICES BACK TO STAND UP A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY CALIMESA- WHICH DOES IS DOES CONSIST OF R. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY- PLANS AS WELL AS PART OF MUNICIPAL MEMBERS THEMSELVES WE THINK THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY A LOT OF CONVERSATION IS ALREADY MOVING FORWARD ON THIS AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THE STATE OFFER OF SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP AND REALLY THE ENCOURAGEMENT. FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL ALL PLAN- TO DO MORE OF THIS CALL WORK MOVING FORWARD- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MOVING THE COMMITTEE FOR OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. C. NINE I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BOTH THE BOTH OF YOU FOR THE INFORMATION OF THIS PARTICULAR PANEL. AND WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR EIGHTH AND FINAL PANEL DR RUBIO. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD WE ARE NOW ON OUR PANEL ON FULL INTEGRATION PLANS WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS- COREY HOW SHOULD I WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS WELL AS MICHELLE CABRERA PLEASE BEGIN. RIGHT SO MY COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WILL BE RELATIVELY SHORT I THINK GIVEN ALL OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSALS THAT YOU SAW WITHIN TELLING. AS WELL AS THE UPCOMING MANAGED CARE PLAN PROCUREMENT YOU SAW WITHIN THE UPDATED TELLING PROPOSAL THAT WE HAD EXTENDED THE TIME PERIOD FOR THE FULL INTEGRATION PLANS. THE DEPARTMENT VERY MUCH IS STILL VERY INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THIS CONCEPT BUT JUST WANTED TO NOTATE- YOU KNOW IT IS A VERY COMPLEX- PROPOSAL AND SO WILL TAKE TIME FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK ON- WE DO ARE VERY INTERESTED TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF THIS APPROACH- TO PROVIDE FULL INTEGRATION OF BOTH PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND POTENTIALLY ORAL HEALTH UNDER ONE CONTRACTED INTO T. BUT AS YOU'D IMAGINE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BEING A REALLY AREN'T RELYING TO COUNTIES- IT WOULD REQUIRE BOTH VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION. THE COUNTY. AS WELL AS A MANAGED CARE PLAN- AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE JUST SO MANY COMPLEXITIES TO- TO THINK THROUGH IN REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSAL WHICH IS REALLY WHY. ARE YOU SEE THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION- OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL- AND WOULD JUST NOTATE THAT NO WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PEACE AT THIS TIME. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY AND WHERE WE ARE IN OUR CURRENT ANALYSIS WE DID NOT THINK THAT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE SOME. OF THAT RISK IS THE END OF MY COMMENTS. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THAT TIME. COREY HOSPITAL WITH THE L. A. M. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA- ELIA WILL ALSO BE VERY BRIEF AND OUR COMMENTS ON ON THIS PARTICULAR PANEL- JUST SORT OF WANT TO ECHO- YOU KNOW THAT THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THESE PILOTS AND YOU KNOW PROVIDING A MORE INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE APPROACH TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- AS NOTED. BY THE BY THE DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTING THESE THESE PILOTS IS GOING TO BE A VERY COMPLEX EFFORT AND A VERY SIGNIFICANT LEFT- YOU KNOW GIVEN THIS WE DO FIND THAT THE LATER- SORT OF EXTENDED TIME FRAME FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE- THE PROPOSED PILOTS REYES A HOST OF COMPLEXITIES HERE PARTICULARLY AROUND REALIGNMENT IN WHICH COMPONENTS OF THE PILOT. COUNTIES WILL PAY FOR WHICH COMPONENTS THE STATE WILL PAY FOR- AND AS THE STATE WORKS TOWARDS THESE PIRATE PILOTS YOU KNOW A VERY COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IS GOING TO BE NEEDED TO NAVIGATE THESE ISSUES WELL RIGHT NOW THE COUNTY PROPOSAL DOESN'T DOESN'T INCLUDE DETAILS RELATED TO WHAT THIS PLAN IS GOING TO BE BACK. IN THE STATE MOVES FORWARD WITH WITH PURSUING THESE PILOTS- THE DETAILS ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED TO BE FLUSHED OUT GOING FORWARD- AND THAT'S THAT'S ON ALL IN. THE SAME ISSUE THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM FED CABRERA EXITS. TO OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN CHAIRED THE SHOCK OF IT AT THE BEACH CA- I AM GOING TO SPEAK ACTUALLY TO- SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE DHEA HAS WITH THE PROPOSAL CORPORAL INTEGRATION PLAN- THAT GO BEYOND REALIGNING CONSIDERATION- AND I THINK THAT WE BELIEVE MUST BE CAREFULLY WEIGHED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AB FIVE. EIGHT AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PURSUIT OF ENCOURAGING- THE VOLUNTARY AND ESPECIALLY TO MENTAL HEALTH AND ACTIVITY CARVE OUT THROUGH VOLUNTARY POOL INTEGRATION PLAN- UNDER THIS MODEL SPECIAL BE MENTAL HEALTH AND BEAUTY SERVICES WOULD NO LONGER BE ADMINISTERED BY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN. BUT RATHER BY AND MANAGED CARE ENTITY THAT OPERATES THE FULL INTEGRATION PILOT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MAY CREATE SEVERAL MAJOR PROBLEMS THAT WE NEED TO FLESH OUT FIRST NATIONALLY MANAGED CARE CARBON OF SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL POPULATION ARE RELATIVELY NEW AND STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES. WE'RE NOT AWARE OF SIGNIFICANT STUDY ON HOW THESE EARLY CARBON VERY IMPACTING ACCESS TO SPECIALTY SERVICES PARTICULARLY WITH DISPONIBLE POPULATION WHICH- BECAUSE BE UNIQUE DYNAMIC- THAT WHEN AND A PERSON WITH THE- MENTALLYMENTAL ILLNESS FAILED TO FILL BY SOME. YEARS DON'T JUST SHOW UP ON THE MEDICAID HEALTH PLAN OR PROVIDER LEDGERS OUT WITH OTHER FORMS OF MEDICAL DISEASE AN ILLNESS BUT RATHER THESE INDIVIDUALS END UP OUTSIDE OF MEDICAID REIMBURSABLE SERVICES. SUCH AS IN THE I AND B. SERVICES BE DISTRACTED DAY OR IN OTHER LOCKER SPENDING PLEDGES STATE HOSPITAL IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO A LINE THROUGH HEALTH PLAN INTEGRATION ALONE. CHINESE ON THE OTHER HAND CURRENTLY BEAR REPORT AND INVEST. IN WHAT I'D LIKE TO REFER TO AS THE MEDIC CAL BOOKEND. ON THE FRONT END EARLY. OUR IN ENGAGEMENT SERVICES. AND ON THE BACK AND A CUTE INCLUDING. TEND TO BE. AND I AM DE AS AS BLACK THAT IN BETTER NOT COVERED THROUGH MEDICAID HOW. JOHNNY BE REAL. CURRENTLY OPERATES UNDER A GOLD BUDGET FOR IT BUT IF YOU HEARD TO DATE. WE MUST HOPE TO NOW A COMPLEX WEB OF THE AND FEDERAL WILL THAT THE- BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE. OUR SIX TWO REMOVE SO MANY OF BARRIERS. IN BETTER OUT WE NEED TO CAN WHAT GOAL ARE AND WHAT IF THE GOAL TO THAT THE HEALTH OUT AND LOWERING THE WHITE COLLAR AND MORE FOR AND GET WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IN AT THE DEEP. LATER SO OFTEN AT THE WITH CAPTAIN TO PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE OF OUR MANAGE CARE CURRENTLY IN MANAGE THE MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT. BY AND LARGE MANAGE CARE PLANS AND HEALTH HOW DID SHE ADMINISTRATIVE INTEGRATION OF THAT BENEFIT BUT THESE BENEFITS ARE OFTEN ADMINISTERED TO A SEPARATE DELEGATED IN ANY CITY WITH SEPARATE PROVIDER NETWORKS. ADMINISTRATIVE AND FISCAL INTEGRATION HAS NOT YET RESULTED IN THE TYPE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE INTEGRATION BUT PHYSICAL HEALTH THAT WE MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED WITH THE WHOLE LOT OF THEIR BENEFITS. THEREFORE WE WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT ADMINISTRATIVE INTEGRATION AND CLINICAL INTEGRATION REALLY. AREN'T TOO DIFFERENT ENDEAVORS. WHY WOULDN'T OUR THAT BETTER ALIGN FIND IN IN AND- MIGHT HELP DRIVE QUALITY INTO. IT IS NOT A GOOD AND- SERVING. MY AND IT WILL BE CAN BE A CHALLENGE PARTICULARLY IF YOU GO ON. LOCATION FOUR MONTHS ON. STATUS. NO CHILD BY. BOB CHOIR. PLEASE OUT AND ENGAGEMENT ACT AS WELL AS I AND YOU ARE NOT COVERED BY. IT ALSO RICK FIELD BASED SERVICES WHICH BRINGS THE PROVIDE OUT INTO COMMUNITY TO MEET CLIENT WHERE THEY ARE AT RATHER THAN X. CLIENT COME INTO FOR WHAT OF THE HOUSE CARE. FURTHER FMI ITS BEAUTY CLIENT ALL BASED DIDN'T BIG MONEY IN TRYING TO ACT ALL FORMS THE CARE YEAH I THINK BE HERE HEALTH. THAT TIME BUT OFTEN CLAIM MUCH MORE EXPECT WELCOME UNLESS STATEMENT WITH THEIR WITHIN THEIR BEHAVIOR FROM. AS PRIMARY HOW HOME I TALKED KELLY RESTING. WELL MAKE CAN IS HELP. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- LONG STANDING STICKING. TOWARD THE RIVER GOAL PLAN CONCLUDED. NOT GUARANTEE AND THERE MUST BE A FIVE PART OF THE ANALYSIS OF HOW BENEFICIARIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE SAFE. INTEGRATION EXPERIMENT. THE ANALYSIS ON THE INTEGRATION OF SERVICES PARTICULARLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MORE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH AN EYE TOWARD WHAT EXISTS OUTSIDE OF THE SPEAKING AT TODAY. UNLIKE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE COUNTY SAFETY NET DEMONSTRATE THAT EVEN THOSE WITH PRIVATE COMMERCIAL COVERAGE CANNOT ACCESS TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS REFERENCED BY- THE- PERSON EARLIER WITH AT THE END YOU. KNOW SERVICES SOMETIMES THEY'RE ONLY AVAILABLE TO THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SAFETY NET AND THEY'RE COMPLEMENTED WITH NON MEDICAL SERVICES IN OTHER WORDS IT WON'T BE AS SIMPLE AS BUILDING A NETWORK WITH EXISTING PROVIDERS WHO OFTEN AREN'T WILLING. TO COME INTO MEDICARE NETWORKS AT ALL. FURTHER THANK YOU FOR HOLDING TO DATE ALREADY PROVIDE- INTO ACCESS WITH HOUSING SO SERVICES. EDUCATION AND OTHER OUT OF HELP. SYSTEM ANOTHER UNIT ELEMENT OF THE B. HEALTH SAFETY NET ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WHICH WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE R. THE HYPER TENDERS AROUND CLIENTS AND COMMUNITY VOICE AND CHOICE AS WELL S AN ORIENTATION AROUND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE RECOVERY PRINCIPLE. CAN EVEN CLIENTS AND GAUGE IN INFORMING IMAGE IT'S A PLAN THROUGH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AS WELL AS WE GET TO ENGAGEMENT IN OUR CULTURAL COMPETENCE PLAN. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THESE PRACTICES ARE UNIQUE IN THE WAY THAT THEY ARE- REQUIRED TO BE DONE UNDER MEDIC HOUSE SPECIALTY BECAUSE THEY'LL HELP. AS A RESULT WE SERVE HIGHER NUMBERS THE BENEFICIARY OF COLOR AND HAVE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY DEFINED PRACTICES. OUTSIDE OF MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. ONE THE BOTH OF CHALLENGE TO BRING MANY OF THE SERVICES IN UNDER MEDICARE WE- MANY ALSO BUSINESS WORK FORCED. IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THE AVAILABILITY OF HONEY BEES PROVIDERS HAS REALLY MADE UP FOR SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS ACROSS THE STATE BOTH IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS ALIKE. COUNTIES ALSO MANAGED PRIVATE INPATIENT SERVICES TREATMENT FOR LPS CONSERVATIVE. PREVENTION AND OTHER TYPES OF EMERGENCY DISASTER SERVICES A QUALITY KEEPER HOPE THEIR RESEARCH IN THE REMAINING AND SHARE ALL OF THAT WOULD FALL OUTSIDE. OF HEALTH MEDICAL HEALTH PLAN- SMITH RESPONSE- FOR CBH HAS MANY ABOUT THE AFFECT THE PULLING TRUTH BUT THAT SHOULD BE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MODEL APART TO REDISTRIBUTE ONLY MEDICAL BENEFITS TO ANOTHER ADMINISTRATOR DEMAND. FROM THE BROADER CONTINUUM OF SERVICES. LET ME BE CLEAR WE SUPPORT GREATER EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING BENEFICIARY ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND OTHER CRITICAL HEALTH SERVICES.
