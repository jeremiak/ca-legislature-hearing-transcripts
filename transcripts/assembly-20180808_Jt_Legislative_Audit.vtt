00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:11.008

GRATEFUL FOR HIS ACCESSIBILITY

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.360
AND HIS CANDID CONVERSATION

00:42:09.426 --> 00:42:10.861

AND FOUND --

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:14.732
I FOUND IT TO BE ONE OF THOSE

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:16.133
MEETINGS WHERE WE BOTH PROBABLY

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.035
FELT THAT BE HAD BANGED OUR

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:19.470

THAT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:26.443
RECEIVE IS THIS IS AS GOOD AS WE

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.845
CAN DO --

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:30.047
THAT WE WERE WRONG AND WHAT WE

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.615
SAID BEFORE WASN'T QUITE RIGHT

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:32.683
AND NOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE MANY

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.551
YEARS TO EVEN BEGIN TO MAKE THE

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:36.186
KIND OF CHANGES NECESSARY TO DO

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:37.321
SOMETHING THAT.

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.689
WE ARE HOLDING BUSINESSES

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:40.024
ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING IF IF THEY

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.825
DO IT POORLY AND THAT IS PROTECT

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:43.894
THE PRIVATE INFORMATION OF OUR

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:45.696

WITH MY OFFICE AND MEMBERS OF

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:55.139
THIS LEGISLATURE.

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:57.074
BUT HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:58.208
WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM EDTA

00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:01.512
IN RESPONSE INCONSISTENT ANSWERS --

REQUIRED US SO SECURITY NUMBERS

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.551
TO BE USED WE LATER FOUND THAT

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:08.852
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.587
AND CALIFORNIA'S OWN LAW SAYS

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:13.023
THAT AGENCIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.992
SEND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:16.460
FULL SO SECURITY NUMBERS IN THE

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:17.861

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:05.028
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF SET

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.963

HAVE IN OUR STATE WILL BE THE

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:10.186
LARGEST.

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:12.522
IN OUR COUNTRY.

SOMEWHERE AROUND.

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:16.960
IT'S GONNA COST A WHOLE LOT OF

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.094
MONEY --

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:21.130

THERE?

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:28.438
WE HAVE ALREADY SET A COURSE TO

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.139
GET TO THAT PLACE A PLACE OF

A LOW TECH SOLUTION THAT WE CAN

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:39.849
GO THROUGH.

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.085
THEY ALL COST MONEY.

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:43.152
AND IF I DON'T HAVE MONEY

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.954

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.509
HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR ME.

00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:08.211
WE HAVE RECEIVED THE BEST

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:09.746
RATINGS FOR THE SOLE SECURITY

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:11.281

I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:28.298
ALREADY GOING THROUGH A SYSTEM

00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:29.365
THAT IT WHETHER OR NOT I'M OKAY

00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:31.901
WITH THE AUDIT FRANKLY IS NOT.

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:33.870

FIGHT GOT TO DECIDE AT A FRANKLY

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:41.678
WOULD BE SPENDING MY TIME AND I

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:42.612
WOULD THINK THAT.

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:43.713
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.448
GUYS COULD FOCUS ON THAT A

00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:47.150
FRANKLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:48.818
SECTION WELL IT'S A TO THE

00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:50.019
PEOPLE THAT ARE AND IT LOOKED AT

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:51.321
THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME AND OF

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:52.388
WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU THAT YOUR

00:59:52.455 --> 00:59:52.922
DECISION WHETHER.

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:55.258
YOU RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:59:55.325 --> 00:59:58.227
BUT BUT THE HIVE YES VERY LUCKY

00:59:58.294 --> 00:59:59.095
OF THE AUDITOR DESCRIBED IF YOU

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:00.496
CAN LET ME ASK CONTINUE MY

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.197
QUESTION I WOULD REALLY

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:01.965
APPRECIATED.

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.400
WHAT MY WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:05.435
TO YOU IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.736
BOTH FOR THOSE FOLKS THAT THEIR

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.304
IDENTITY IS BEING STOLEN THAT'S

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.906
THEIR PRIORITY AND SO HOW CAN WE

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.641
COME TOGETHER? TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:12.709
YOUR PRIORITIES ARE THEIR

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.811
PRIORITIES AS WELL BECAUSE THIS

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.479
IT'S JUST SOUNDS AGAIN I'M JUST

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:17.780
A NORMAL PERSON AND TO ME IT

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:18.948
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A BIG DEAL.

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:20.850
AND PERHAPS THERE IS THAT MONEY

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.151
PROBLEM BUT WE CAN'T KEEP

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:23.653
EXCUSING --

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.356
INEFFICIENCIES BASED ON ON BOND

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:28.391
MONEY BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.692
WAYS THAT CAN.

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:31.427
EITHER I DON'T KNOWSAVED SOME

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:32.695
MONEY SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW THAT

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:33.730
THERE'S AND EFFICIENCIES IN

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:34.931
EVERY DEPARTMENT AND SO IF WE

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.499
CAN FIGURE OUT HOW THOSE

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.267
INEFFICIENCIES CAN BE --

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:40.069
CORRECTED BUT THIS IS A BIG

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:41.738
CONCERN AND IT SHOULD BE.

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:44.073
YOUR NUMBER TWO PRIORITY IS TO

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.408
MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS --

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.809
IDENTITIES ARE NOT BEING STOLEN

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:48.845
SO JUST WITH THAT I APPRECIATED

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:49.746
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA GO ROUND AND

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.247
ROUND AND ROUND IT DOESN'T SOUND

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.382
LIKE WE'RE GONNA COME TO A

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:54.183
RESOLUTION ON THAT THE AUDITOR.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.585
ON STEPS AND THAT THEM BUT I

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.020
THINK I AGREE WITH YOU IS THAT

01:00:57.086 --> 01:01:00.490
IT IT SHOULD BE ONE OF OUR

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:01.124
PRIORITIES I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.724
TO A BUT I WILL TELL YOU THE

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:02.658
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:03.426
PEOPLE THAT RECEIVE THESE

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.060
BENEFITS.

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.362
IS GETTING THAT CHECK.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:07.764
AND I HAVE A COMPUTER SYSTEM

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.032
THAT YES BUT IF THEIR IDENTITIES

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:10.233
STOLEN THOSE CHECKS ARE GONE

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.101
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE PAYING --

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.069
OTHER --

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.170
WHEN THEIR IDENTITIES ARE STOLEN

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.239
AND SOMEBODY'S CHARGING UP FOR

01:01:16.305 --> 01:01:17.673
EXAMPLE ON THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.808
THAT TECH WILL BE GONE BECAUSE

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:20.543
CREDITORS WILL COME AFTER THEM

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:21.577
WAS ALRIGHT THANK YOU I'M GOING

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.179

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.460
SERVICE THAT YOU PROVIDE.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.428
TO PROBABLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

NUMBER ON THEM.

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:52.241
AND WE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO USING

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:54.210
THEM AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IN THE

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:56.112
MAIL COMES THIS ENVELOPE FROM

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.713

TO USE A NEW.

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.467
SO I KNOW THIS CAN BE DONE.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.435
WHAT I'VE BEEN UNABLE

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:19.735

IS WHAT THAT BUT THE WHAT THE

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:30.980
REAL PROBLEM IS WHAT THE

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:31.614
TIMELINE IS AND WHAT THE DOLLARS

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.549
ARE.

WE'RE NOW IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:39.155
EIGHTEEN AND I THINK WHAT I

IT SENDS ME THAT THE REASON FOR

THE MOMENT YOUR ISSUE THE TICKET

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:37.446
NUMBER THAT TIME DOES NOT

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.880
ACCOUNT FOR THE HOURS SPENT

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:41.616
NUMBER.

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:43.018
ACCORDING TO DMV THE INCREASE WE

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:44.820
TYPES ARE PROBABLY DUTY

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.254
IMPLEMENTATION OF REAL LIGHTING.

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:48.824
WHICH STATES BUT TO CONTINUE TO

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:49.724
TWENTY TWENTY ABOUT THIRTY

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:51.660
MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE A

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.528

TWENTY TWENTY AND THE ONLY WAY.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:01.636

OFFICE BEFORE THAT DEADLINE.

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:06.007
I KNOW THAT YESTERDAY THERE WAS

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:07.209
A ROBUST DISCUSSION REGARDING

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:08.810
LONG WAIT TIMES.

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:10.545
THE DMV WASN'T ABLE TO GIVE

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:12.147
CONCRETE TIMELINES ON WHEN THE

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:13.482

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:15.217

FIX THIS PROBLEM?

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.253
MY CONCERN IS THAT DECISIONS

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.988
WILL CONTINUE TO FACE

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:21.556

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:24.426
NOW.

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:26.461
THERE'S A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:27.996
FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON ANY PLANS.

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:29.731
TO HELP WITH THE WAIT TIMES AS

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:30.265
WELL AS A DISTRUST OF THE

01:19:30.332 --> 01:19:31.800
DEPARTMENT.

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:33.435

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.540
PARTISAN ISSUE.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.108

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:44.079

REALLY GET DOWN TO FIGURE OUT

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:47.549
HOW TO SOLVE THE SOLUTION.

TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:13.575
DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN FOR

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.744

YET THE WAIT TIMES HAVE ACTUALLY

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:20.081
EXPLODED.

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.816
YESTERDAY WE HEARD A LOT OF

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.385
EXCUSES --

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.355
YEAR'S BUDGET.

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:30.025
HAS RESULTED IN ONLY ONE OR TWO

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:33.328
NEW EMPLOYEES AT EACH LOCATION.

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:35.363
THROWING MONEY AT THIS PROBLEM

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:36.998
IS NOT GOING TO FIX IT TO THE

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.233
DEPTH OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.168
WE ARE UNCOVERING.

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:41.469
WE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE SIX

AND THE LINES ARE STILL OUT THE

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:48.243
DOOR.

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.177
THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:51.780
REQUESTING THE AUDIT FOR A DEEP.

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:54.082
DIVE INTO THE DELAYS THAT ARE

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.784

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.377
OUTAGES.

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:24.379
THE TIMES THAT THE DMV'S FORTY

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:27.182
YEAR OLD SYSTEM CRASHES.

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:27.782
CUSTOMERS ARE LEFT SCRATCHING

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:29.150
THEIR HEADS.

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:32.020
THIS HAPPENED ON MONDAY ACROSS

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.421
THE STATE FOR ALMOST A HALF A

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:35.223
DAY.

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:36.992
IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY BUT UPON

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.461
DIRECT --

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.296
QUESTIONING OF THE DIRECTOR.

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:43.498

THESE DETAILS MAY BE

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:57.846
EMBARRASSING BUT THEY'RE

01:21:57.912 --> 01:21:59.514
NECESSARY FOR US TO FIND OUT AND

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.316
WE THINK THAT THE AUDIT.

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:02.984
HELPS US TO GET THERE WE FIND

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:04.619
OURSELVES IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE.

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:06.321
A MASSIVE FAILURE OF ONE OF THE

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:07.789
MOST SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT

TIMELY MANNER.

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.496
WHICH IS THAT FUNDAMENTAL

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:16.898
RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEING IF

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.300
THERE WAS EVER A DEPARTMENT IN

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:20.001

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:27.042
WE HAVE A COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUAL

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:29.311
TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY.

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:31.313
COLIN GRANT IS A MANAGER IN THE

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:43.291
HE KNOWS THE DMB SYSTEMS INSIDE

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.694
AND OUT HE IS A PROFESSIONAL AND

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.696
PASSIONATE LEADER WHO JUST

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:50.131
SIMPLY HAS RUN OUT OF OPTIONS

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:51.900
AND REALLY WANTS TO BE PART.

01:22:51.966 --> 01:22:53.868
OF MAKING THE KINDS OF SYSTEMIC

THE PRIMARY THINGS THAT WAS TO

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:38.785
BE DONE WITH THAT MONEY WAS CHIU

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:39.719
INSTITUTE.

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:40.954

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:43.089
[inaudible]

01:47:43.156 --> 01:47:45.692
SIMONI A MOMENT AGO YOU SAID

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:46.326
SOMETHING REALLY ALARMING WHICH

01:47:46.393 --> 01:47:47.394
IS THAT.

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.262
IT ONLY LAST WEEK DO WE ACTUALLY

01:47:49.329 --> 01:47:50.831
GET THOSE OFFICE HOURS OPENED IS

01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:51.398
IS THAT THE CASE BECAUSE I

01:47:51.464 --> 01:47:52.365
REMEMBER THAT THERE WERE

01:47:52.432 --> 01:47:54.067

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:56.636

WITHOUT DOWN.

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:08.615

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:14.955

THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO WE

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:37.310
WERE MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS

01:48:37.377 --> 01:48:39.145
AYE AND PART OF IT IS THAT WE

01:48:39.212 --> 01:48:40.780
HAD TO GET SOME LEASES IN PLACE

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:41.948

YOU DIDN'T SEE THE DEMAND FOR

01:49:05.105 --> 01:49:07.073
THEM AND SO YOU CURTAIL THEM AND

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:07.908
THEN RECENTLY HAVE BROUGHT THEM

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:08.108
BACK.

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:10.977

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.915
MADE IT JUST THE IT SEEMS TO ME

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:16.383
THAT IF EVEN IF THE DEMAND FOR

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:17.984
REAL ID WASN'T THERE BUT THAT'S

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:19.286
NOT THE ONLY SERVICE THAT THESE

01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:20.987

TIMES WAIT AND WE ARE.

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:37.871
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WAS A

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:39.039
AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:40.640
THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:42.976
HIGH TO AND CONTINUE TO IMPROVE

01:49:43.043 --> 01:49:44.411
OUR SERVICES SO IF THATTHE

01:49:44.477 --> 01:49:46.346
LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED MONEY

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:47.147
FOR THAT PURPOSE.

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:49.082
AND WE THERE WAS CURTAILED THE

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:50.083
SOME OF THAT MONEY LEFT WHAT WE

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:51.885
USE THAT WE WERE ALSO WORKING

01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:53.987
ADDITIONAL OVERTIME SO --

01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:55.789
THE MONEY THAT WAS NEEDS FOR

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:57.090
SELF SERVICE THAT WE WERE NOT

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.425
USING -- WAS

01:49:58.491 --> 01:50:00.961
SPENT ON OVERTIME FOR THE

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:02.162
EMPLOYEES TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS.

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:04.130
SO THE MONEY'S GONE.

01:50:04.197 --> 01:50:07.300
MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT A OKAY WELL

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:07.968
I I FIND THAT A LITTLE

01:50:08.034 --> 01:50:10.236
DISTURBING I I WISH THAT IF WE

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:11.571
IF WE APPROPRIATE MONEY FOR

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:13.473
CERTAIN PURPOSE YOU KNOW THAT

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.407
THAT I FEEL LIKE USED OF OPEN

01:50:14.474 --> 01:50:16.743
THE THE FIELD OFFICE HOURS --

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:18.144
THE FIELD OFFICES ON SATURDAYS

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.612
AND KEPT THEM OPEN AND MAYBE

01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:21.047
THAT WOULD HAVE --

01:50:21.114 --> 01:50:22.515
MADE THIS PROBLEM A LITTLE BIT

01:50:22.582 --> 01:50:24.884
LESS SEVERE BUT IT UNITED SOME A

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:25.952
DISCUSSION YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS

01:50:26.019 --> 01:50:29.222
AND I I VERY STRONGLY FEEL THAT --

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:30.023
OUR CONSTITUENTS REALLY DON'T

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:32.025
CARE ABOUT WHY THIS IS HAPPENING

01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:33.293
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:33.893
WHY THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THE

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:34.694
WHAT.

01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:37.364
BEYOND FOR BETTER FOR WORSE.

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:39.332
INTERACTION WITH THE DM V. IS

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.900
ONE OF THE PRIMARY TOUCH POINTS

01:50:40.967 --> 01:50:43.169
THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE WITH

01:50:43.236 --> 01:50:44.938
THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE.

01:50:45.005 --> 01:50:46.806
THOUSANDS OF STATE DEPARTMENTS

01:50:46.873 --> 01:50:48.008
AND YET OUR AVERAGE CONSTITUENT

01:50:48.074 --> 01:50:49.009
WILL PROBABLY ORDER THE

01:50:49.075 --> 01:50:50.343
INTERACTION YOU OVER THE COURSE

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:52.112
OF YEAR WITH WITH ONE OR TWO AND

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:53.580
ONE OF THOSE IS PROBABLY A DMP

01:50:53.646 --> 01:50:54.080
SO.

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:55.215
THEY ARE COLORING THEIR

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:56.616
PERCEPTIONS OF OUR ENTIRE STATE

01:50:56.683 --> 01:50:58.018
GOVERNMENT BY.

01:50:58.084 --> 01:51:01.321
THEIR EXPERIENCES AT THE

01:51:01.388 --> 01:51:02.188
VARIANCES ARE NOT GIVING THEM A

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:04.924
VERY POSITIVE VIEW OF THE WAY

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:05.592
THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT IS SERVING

01:51:05.658 --> 01:51:06.493
THEM SO.

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.762
BUT WE NEED TO GET THIS FIXED --

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:10.630
IMMEDIATELY I THINK YOU'RE GONNA

01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:11.898
HEAR THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:14.434
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ON AUDIT.

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:15.468
IS NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:16.236
THAT'S PUNITIVE IT'S NOT

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:17.404

THAT YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY WHERE

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.142
THE PROBLEMS ARE WORTH A BOTTLE

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:22.942
NECKS ARE.

01:51:23.009 --> 01:51:24.310
AND GET THEM FIXED I THINK THE

01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:26.379
AUDITOR HAS RESOURCES THAT MAYBE

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:27.947

GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION WE'RE

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:43.329
TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS A

PRIMARILY THE ENVY --

01:52:19.165 --> 01:52:22.268

LICENSES AND OTHER OTHER THINGS --

01:52:28.508 --> 01:52:30.977
AND IT IT WHEN IT GOES BADLY IT

01:52:31.044 --> 01:52:32.912
IT TENDS TO GO VERY BADLY AND

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:34.447
THEM AND THEY COME BACK TO US.

01:52:34.514 --> 01:52:36.649

NOT SO MUCH THAT WE HAD BOTH OF

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:45.658
THEM HERE TODAY WITHOUT REQUESTS.

01:52:45.725 --> 01:52:46.826
WHILE LOOKING AT VARIOUS UP

01:52:46.893 --> 01:52:47.427
PIECES OF THOSE --

01:52:47.494 --> 01:52:49.395
THOSE DEPARTMENTS.

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:51.197
AND I I DID WATCH THE MAJORITY

01:52:51.264 --> 01:52:52.565
OF THE VERY LONG HEARING

01:52:52.632 --> 01:52:53.533

TIME TO TO WATCH IT --

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:01.007
AND AND I I I THINK THERE WAS

01:53:01.074 --> 01:53:02.375
SOME TROUBLING THINGS THEREIN

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:04.811
AND TO SAVE PEOPLE TIME --

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:05.945
THAT DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO

01:53:06.012 --> 01:53:07.247
WATCH I'M GONNA ASK A COUPLE OF

01:53:07.313 --> 01:53:08.781
QUESTIONS IF THE REPEATS OF

01:53:08.848 --> 01:53:10.283
YESTERDAY --

01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:11.584
IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME BUT THERE

01:53:11.651 --> 01:53:13.353

AND THEN WE CURTAIL THEM --

02:05:46.038 --> 02:05:47.940
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN --

02:05:48.007 --> 02:05:49.608
I DID A CULTURAL.

02:05:49.675 --> 02:05:53.279
I SEE IT IS A LET ME BACK UP

02:05:54.179 --> 02:05:55.080
DMT -- WE'VE

02:05:55.147 --> 02:05:57.483
BEEN CONDITIONED OVER THE YEARS

02:05:57.549 --> 02:05:59.585
TO ACCEPT THAT THE DMV IS.

02:05:59.652 --> 02:06:01.887
LYING THE FOR THE HOURS BUT I

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:03.722
THINK ALSO THE EMPLOYEES HAVE

02:06:03.789 --> 02:06:05.624
BEEN CONDITION THAT IT'S OKAY.

02:06:05.691 --> 02:06:07.192

OR ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:17.836
DO FOR THE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE I

02:06:17.903 --> 02:06:19.204
THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE THAT IT

02:06:19.271 --> 02:06:21.373
IS A CULTURE IT'S A DMB CULTURE

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.007
I JUST WAS JOKING A COUPLE WEEKS

02:06:22.074 --> 02:06:23.042
AGO.

02:06:23.108 --> 02:06:25.911
ABOUT THE DMV AND THE WHEN THIS

02:06:25.978 --> 02:06:27.980
CAME UP I WENT OH I'M PART OF

02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:30.182
THAT CULTURE AS WELL.

02:06:30.249 --> 02:06:31.483
ARE WE GONNA HAVE ANY KIND OF

02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:33.018
TRAINING OR ANY KIND OF I DON'T

02:06:33.085 --> 02:06:35.387
EVEN KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO TO

02:06:35.454 --> 02:06:36.889
CHANGE THE CULTURE.

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:38.958
A OF THE EMPLOYEES IN THE DAY

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:41.393
THERE'S MANY THAT DON'T.

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.095
YOU NO SLACK OFF AND AND JUST GO

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:44.363
GET COFFEE WHEN PEOPLE IN FRONT

02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:46.398
OF THEM HOWEVER THE OVERALL

02:06:46.465 --> 02:06:47.967
CLERK CULTURE AT LEAST IN MY

02:06:48.033 --> 02:06:49.301
PERCEPTION IS THAT.

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:50.703
WHAT'S JUST THE DMV AND PEOPLE

02:06:50.769 --> 02:06:52.037
ARE JUST GOING TO ACCEPT THAT SO

02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:56.075
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:58.344
PEOPLE KIND OF TRAINING SO THAT

02:06:58.410 --> 02:06:59.445
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:02.314
CULTURE IS IS IS GONE --

02:07:02.381 --> 02:07:03.816
THE OTHER THING IS I KNOW THAT

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:06.485
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF OF PROCESSING

02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:07.853
THESE THINGS QUICKLY I JUST GOT

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:10.222
MY DRIVER'S LICENSE.

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:12.791
ACTUALLY TWO WEEKS AGO AND I DID

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:15.194
AN ONLINE AND WITHIN THE WEEK I

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:16.328
HAVE MY DRIVER'S LICENSE WHICH I

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:17.997
WAS REALLY IMPRESSED SO IF YOU

02:07:18.063 --> 02:07:18.597
HAVE THAT.

02:07:18.664 --> 02:07:21.133
ABILITY ONLINE WHY DON'T WE HAVE

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:23.402
THE ABILITY WHEN FOLKS ARE --

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:26.305
THERE IN PERSON AND SO THE ONE

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:28.140
REQUEST I GUESS WOULD BE IS WHAT

02:07:28.207 --> 02:07:29.908
CAN CAN YOU LOOK AND INTO KIND

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:32.311
OF THE CULTURE MAY BE THE THE

02:07:32.378 --> 02:07:34.113
AYE AYE THAT SOME OF THE OUR

02:07:34.179 --> 02:07:35.547
SURVEY SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES AS

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.116
FAR AS A CULTURE I THINK THE

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:37.916
GENTLEMAN THAT TESTIFIED.

02:07:37.983 --> 02:07:39.718
EARLIER SAID THAT THAT'S PART OF

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.053
THE PROBLEM AS WELL IT'S NOT

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.755
JUST THE SYSTEMS OR THE OUTDATED

02:07:42.821 --> 02:07:43.922
EQUIPMENT IT'S THE CULTURE OF

02:07:43.989 --> 02:07:45.024
THE DMV.

02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:46.692
AND WE NEED TO FIX THAT AS WELL

02:07:46.759 --> 02:07:48.093
BECAUSE WE CAN INVEST ALL THE

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.395
MONEY WE CAN.

02:07:49.461 --> 02:07:50.329
INTO THE DMB BUT IF THE CULTURE

02:07:50.396 --> 02:07:53.198
THE THEY WERE JUST GOING TO BE

02:07:53.265 --> 02:07:54.733
WAITING IN LINE AGAIN BECAUSE

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:57.069
IT'S JUST KIND OF IT'S ACCEPTED

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:58.604
THAT IT'S THE DMT.

02:07:58.670 --> 02:08:00.939
I GUESS IN SO WE WE ALREADY HAVE

02:08:01.006 --> 02:08:02.875

AND ALSO A SECOND THE AUDIT

02:09:56.555 --> 02:09:57.723
MOTION I PROCEED --

02:09:57.789 --> 02:09:59.124
THIS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD VERY

02:09:59.191 --> 02:10:01.460
VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS --

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:03.195
TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO'S.

02:10:03.262 --> 02:10:05.964
POINT ABOUT CULTURE.

02:10:06.031 --> 02:10:07.499
AND WHAT TRAINING ARE YOU DOING

02:10:07.566 --> 02:10:08.500
I THINK THERE'S AN UNDERLYING

02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:09.801
CURRENT HERE AND I DON'T KNOW

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:11.336
THAT THE AUDIT COVERS IT.

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:12.871
AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE

02:10:12.938 --> 02:10:14.640
ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR WHEN THERE

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:16.608
IS A PERFORMANCE.

02:10:16.675 --> 02:10:18.577
AND I HEAR A LOT OF TERMS THAT

02:10:18.644 --> 02:10:20.179
SOUND GOOD WHICH IS WE'RE GOING

02:10:20.245 --> 02:10:21.346
TO HAVE --

02:10:21.413 --> 02:10:22.781
RESOLVE TRAINING THAT RESOLVE

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:25.050
THIS IS VERY GOOD BUT THEN.

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:26.685
VERY RECENTLY LAST MONTH WE GOT

02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:28.287
AN AUDIT.

02:10:28.353 --> 02:10:29.855
ABOUT AN EMPLOYEE SLEEPING ON

02:10:29.922 --> 02:10:32.457
THE JOB FOR YEARS.

02:10:32.524 --> 02:10:34.226
AND NO ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:10:34.293 --> 02:10:35.961
SO ALL THE TRAINING IN THE WORLD

02:10:36.028 --> 02:10:38.363
FOR THE CULTURE MAY BE HELPFUL

02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:40.766
BUT IF THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:10:40.832 --> 02:10:42.301
IT MEANS NOTHING AND THAT'S THE

02:10:42.367 --> 02:10:45.003
CASE FOR ANY INSTITUTION SO.

02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:46.305
I AS WAS TO MAKE A COMMENT

02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:47.406

GOOD COLLEAGUE HAS MADE A VERY

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:51.944
GOOD POINT THAT THERE'S

02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:53.545
SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE AUDITED

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:54.813
HERE I DON'T GETS COVERED BY THE

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:55.948
AUDIT BUT IT IS.

02:10:56.014 --> 02:10:58.684

02:11:37.356 --> 02:11:38.890
NINETIES AND IF THAT'S I CANNOT

02:11:38.957 --> 02:11:39.992
IT DOESN'T MATCH UP.

02:11:40.058 --> 02:11:41.893
HOW WE NEED TO MAKE MORE

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:43.829
APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE TO MATCH

02:11:43.895 --> 02:11:44.696

02:11:47.633 --> 02:11:49.234
MONTH I KNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT I

02:11:49.301 --> 02:11:50.202
THINK I'M HEARING IS YOU DON'T

02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:51.903

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:55.674
THEY DON'T MATCH UP.

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:56.942
THAT'S WHY OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE

02:11:57.009 --> 02:11:58.310
IN LINE WHEN THEY CAN'T GET AN

02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:00.412
APPOINTMENT BECAUSE THE ONLY

02:12:00.479 --> 02:12:01.280
APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE ARE AFTER

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:02.914
THE EXPIRATION.

02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:04.449
THAT TO ME UNDERSCORES ANOTHER

02:12:04.516 --> 02:12:05.817
REASON WHY WE DESPERATELY NEED

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:06.418

LITTLE BIT OF ALLUSION TO IT IS

02:17:31.142 --> 02:17:32.577
AND THE COMMENT YOU HEARD US

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:34.112
FOLKS BE WAITING IN LINE.

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:35.447
AND SOMEONE JUST CLOSES THE

02:17:35.513 --> 02:17:37.282
WINDOW AND SOMETIME AROUND NOON

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:38.883
EVERYBODY STOPS EVERYTHING STOPS

02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:40.819
THE WIND STOPS. EIGHT YOUR HARD

02:17:40.885 --> 02:17:42.654
WORKERS HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK --

02:17:42.721 --> 02:17:43.722
THEY HAVE BREAKS READ THE DATES

02:17:43.788 --> 02:17:46.424
HEALTHY IT'S GOOD BUT I WANT TO

02:17:46.491 --> 02:17:47.926
KNOW IF THE AUDIT A GIVES YOU

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:49.427
THE FLEXIBILITY TO LOOK AT HOW

02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:50.795
STAFF FOR BEING USED ON THE

02:17:50.862 --> 02:17:51.830
FLOOR.

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:52.664
IN THOSE OFFICES REGARDLESS OF

02:17:52.731 --> 02:17:55.867
WHETHER NOT TO HE OR OTHERWISE

02:17:55.934 --> 02:17:57.769
TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY IS

02:17:57.836 --> 02:17:59.037
IT THAT.

02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:01.039
YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENS OR WHEN

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:02.240
FIVE O'CLOCK COMES AROUND THAT

02:18:02.307 --> 02:18:03.141
HAVE HAVE FIRST HALF HOUR BEFORE

02:18:03.208 --> 02:18:04.275
THE CLOSE SUDDENLY EVERYTHING

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:05.777
SPEEDS UP AND WERE ABLE TO GET

02:18:05.844 --> 02:18:06.344
FOLKS OUT THE DOOR FOR HER

02:18:06.411 --> 02:18:07.312
TESTIMONY.

02:18:07.379 --> 02:18:08.446
DOES NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:09.347
ABILITY TO DO YOU NEED

02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:10.882
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON THAT.

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:11.916
NO I DON'T THINK WE NEED

02:18:11.983 --> 02:18:13.018
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON THAT I

02:18:13.084 --> 02:18:14.319
THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:15.654
WOULD ABSOLUTELY WANT TO LOOK

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:17.322
FOR AND AMEND IT AND THAT WOULD

02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:18.623
BE WOVEN THROUGH A VARIETY OF

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:20.191
DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES MS BAKER

02:18:20.258 --> 02:18:21.826
BECAUSE WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT

02:18:21.893 --> 02:18:22.727
THEIR PLANTS.

02:18:22.794 --> 02:18:25.230
AND THAT WOULD BE RELATED TO HOW

02:18:25.296 --> 02:18:25.830
ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE YOUR

02:18:25.897 --> 02:18:27.232
VARIOUS OFFICES HOW DID YOU

02:18:27.298 --> 02:18:28.733
DETERMINE WHICH OFFICES FOR

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:29.968
SATURDAY HOURS HOW YOU

02:18:30.035 --> 02:18:31.770
DETERMINING HOURS DURING THE DAY

02:18:31.836 --> 02:18:33.171
HOW MANY STAFF ARE YOU GOING TO

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:34.673
HAVE FOR A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS

02:18:34.739 --> 02:18:36.207
THAT SO YES THAT WOULD BE.

02:18:36.274 --> 02:18:37.642
WOVEN THROUGHOUT MULTIPLE

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:38.810
OBJECTIVES THANK YOU IT AND AT

02:18:38.877 --> 02:18:40.812
THE END IN ADDITION GOES TO THE

02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:42.047
ISSUE I WANNA MAKE SURE THE AYE

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:43.715
COVERS THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO

02:18:43.782 --> 02:18:44.482
GET THIS RIGHT [inaudible]

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:45.950
WHOM THAT.

02:18:46.017 --> 02:18:47.852
SOMETIMES FOLKS WAIT AS THEIR

02:18:47.919 --> 02:18:49.454
MANY COMMENTERS HERMAN IS IT

02:18:49.521 --> 02:18:51.489
SOMETIMES A WAIT FOR HOURS FOR

02:18:51.556 --> 02:18:53.324
IT LIKE SIX MINUTES OF SERVICE.

02:18:53.391 --> 02:18:54.492
SO WE TOOK A SCREENSHOT SAID IT

02:18:54.559 --> 02:18:55.794
TOOK ME SEVEN MINUTES ONCE I GOT

02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:56.928
UP THERE TO GET TAKE CARE OF I

02:18:56.995 --> 02:18:58.763
HAD TO WAIT SEVEN HOURS.

02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:00.231
IN OTHER INSTANCES --

02:19:00.298 --> 02:19:01.933
SOMEONE WAITS FOR SEVEN HOURS

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.835
AND HAVE A VERY LONG PROCESS BUT

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:05.704
THAT'S LESS WAIT TIME THAT'S

02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:07.005
MORE WHAT SERVICES BEING

02:19:07.072 --> 02:19:08.673
PROVIDED TO YOU THAT PERHAPS

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:09.641
COULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED A

02:19:09.708 --> 02:19:11.609
DIFFERENT WAY.

02:19:11.676 --> 02:19:14.446
AND AND THAT IS UP MORE THAT CAN

02:19:14.512 --> 02:19:16.147
BE DONE ONLINE AND DOESN'T

02:19:16.214 --> 02:19:18.049
REQUIRE YOU TO COME TO THE DMV

02:19:18.116 --> 02:19:19.718
AND EVEN MORE THAT CAN BE.

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:22.220
ALLOWED IN THE WORLD OF OF THE

02:19:22.287 --> 02:19:23.655
MOTOR CLUBS AND OTHERWISE I

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:24.456
DON'T PERSONALLY HAVE TO THINK

02:19:24.522 --> 02:19:25.390
SHOULD HAVE TO BECOME A MOTOR

02:19:25.457 --> 02:19:26.758
CLUB MEMBER IN ORDER TO GET SOME

02:19:26.825 --> 02:19:27.859
OF THESE OTHER APPOINTMENTS

02:19:27.926 --> 02:19:29.527
WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT A

02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:30.595
SEPARATE HEARING.

02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:32.897
BUT WHAT DOES THE OUGHT TO GIVE

02:19:32.964 --> 02:19:34.833
YOU THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT WHAT

02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:37.302
CAN BE CHANGED AND EVEN MOVED

02:19:37.368 --> 02:19:38.770
OUTSIDE OF THE DMV OFFICE

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:39.871
WHETHER IT'S MORE ONLINE

02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:41.239
TRANSACTIONS.

02:19:41.306 --> 02:19:44.676
OR WHAT MIGHT BE A GOOD.

02:19:44.743 --> 02:19:46.978
CANDIDATE FOR ALLOWING AT A

02:19:47.045 --> 02:19:48.480
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH SIMILAR

02:19:48.546 --> 02:19:50.515
TO HOW THE POST OFFICE WHICH

02:19:50.582 --> 02:19:51.082
ALSO SERVES A VERY CRITICAL

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:51.516
FUNCTION [inaudible]

02:19:51.583 --> 02:19:54.986
HAS A POSTAL ANNEXES THERE OFTEN

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:56.521
SMALL FAMILY BUSINESSES WHERE I

02:19:56.588 --> 02:19:57.622
DON'T HAVE TO GO THE POST OFFICE

02:19:57.689 --> 02:19:58.256
OF I WANT TO SHIP A PACKAGE YOU

02:19:58.323 --> 02:19:59.290
DO THINGS.

02:19:59.357 --> 02:20:00.525
DOES THE I GIVE YOU THE ABILITY

02:20:00.592 --> 02:20:02.427
TO DO THAT.

02:20:02.494 --> 02:20:03.728
AGAIN I THINK THAT WOULD BE

02:20:03.795 --> 02:20:05.096
WOVEN THROUGH VARIETY OF

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.798
OBJECTIVES BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:08.466
LOOKING AT WHAT IS D. M. V.

02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:10.368
DOING.

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:12.904
TO ANTICIPATE REAL ID BUT ALSO

02:20:12.971 --> 02:20:15.039
MANAGE ITS OVERALL FUNCTIONS IT

02:20:15.106 --> 02:20:16.207
WHETHER IT'S REGISTRATION AND

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:19.778
AND INCLUDED IN THOSE PLANS DID

02:20:19.844 --> 02:20:21.279
THEY DETERMINE OKAY THESE ARE

02:20:21.346 --> 02:20:22.881
THE TYPES OF FUNCTIONS THAT WE

02:20:22.947 --> 02:20:24.716
CAN SHIFT AS YOU SUGGEST THAT TO

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.050
AN ANNEX OR WE COULD MAKE THAT

02:20:26.117 --> 02:20:27.252
AN ONLINE FUNCTION.

02:20:27.318 --> 02:20:29.120
PARTICULARLY SINCE REAL ID THE

02:20:29.187 --> 02:20:30.555
REQUIREMENT IS YOU HAVE TO COME

02:20:30.622 --> 02:20:33.024
INTO A DMV OFFICE SO WE KNOW

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:33.725
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FOLKS COMING IN

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:33.992
THE DMP.

02:20:34.058 --> 02:20:35.493
ARE THERE OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.328
WE COULD CONVERT TO JUST AN

02:20:37.395 --> 02:20:39.864
ONLINE SITUATION OR HAVE THE

02:20:39.931 --> 02:20:41.699
SATELLITE.

02:20:41.766 --> 02:20:43.268
ANNEXES OR WHATEVER TO SO OKAY

02:20:43.334 --> 02:20:44.803
THE A SHORT ANSWER IS I THINK IT

02:20:44.869 --> 02:20:46.371
WOULD BE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE

02:20:46.437 --> 02:20:48.006
THAT THE DISCUSSION TODAY WE

02:20:48.072 --> 02:20:49.774
WOULD WE THAT IN A VARIETY OF

02:20:49.841 --> 02:20:51.075
OBJECTIVES AND I HOMES OUT THANK

02:20:51.142 --> 02:20:52.143
YOU BECAUSE I THINK YOU'D BE

02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:53.478
VERY VALUABLE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE

02:20:53.545 --> 02:20:54.379
IN THE WEEDS.

02:20:54.445 --> 02:20:55.847
ON ON HOW THEY'RE OPERATING

02:20:55.914 --> 02:20:58.316
PARTICULAR WITH WILL WHAT ARE

02:20:58.383 --> 02:21:00.552
GOOD CANDIDATES. TO TO ALLOW FOR

02:21:00.618 --> 02:21:03.321
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS --

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:04.689
NOT LIMITED TO MOTOR CLUBS BUT

02:21:04.756 --> 02:21:06.191
EVEN BEYOND BECAUSE WE'VE DONE

02:21:06.257 --> 02:21:07.425
THAT IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE VERY

02:21:07.492 --> 02:21:08.860
CRITICAL TRANSACTIONS LIKE

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:11.029
POSTAL SERVICE WORK THAT NOW IS

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:13.398
IS PROVIDED IN OTHER WAYS --

02:21:13.464 --> 02:21:14.899
I ALSO WERE AND I'M I'M DOING

02:21:14.966 --> 02:21:16.000
THIS BECAUSE I REALLY WANNA MAKE

02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:17.135
SURE GET IT RIGHT AGAIN.

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:18.736
YOU KNOW THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS

02:21:18.803 --> 02:21:20.505
EVERY ELECTION CYCLE THEY HAVE

02:21:20.572 --> 02:21:21.506
TO RAMP UP WITH A LOT OF

02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:23.374
TEMPORARY WORKERS TO PROCESS

02:21:23.441 --> 02:21:24.776
BILL BY MAIL BALLOTS.

02:21:24.843 --> 02:21:27.579
AND I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A

02:21:27.645 --> 02:21:28.513
PRACTICE THE DMV HAS HAD IN THE

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:29.714
PAST [inaudible]

02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:32.884
BUT I HOPE THAT THIS WILL ALSO

02:21:32.951 --> 02:21:34.786
GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK

02:21:34.853 --> 02:21:38.122
AT WHAT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN.

02:21:38.189 --> 02:21:40.992
UTILIZED TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS --

02:21:41.059 --> 02:21:42.393
MOST BUSINESSES HAVE TO DEAL

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:43.328
WITH THAT WHEN THEY HAVE AND IF

02:21:43.394 --> 02:21:45.163
THEY DON'T GO TO BUSINESS --

02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:46.297
BUT IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY DO

02:21:46.364 --> 02:21:48.466
THAT -- I

02:21:48.533 --> 02:21:49.567
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE THIS

02:21:49.634 --> 02:21:51.836
AUDIT INCLUDE THE ABILITY.

02:21:51.903 --> 02:21:53.638
TO HOW WELL AND IF THE DMV IS

02:21:53.705 --> 02:21:54.472
APPROPRIATELY RAMPING UP AND

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:56.074
THEN.

02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:57.342
CAME BACK WHAT WHAT I DON'T SEE

02:21:57.408 --> 02:21:58.910
HAPPEN IS A BUDGET THAT WE GIVE

02:21:58.977 --> 02:21:59.477
YOU FOR ONE THING YOU END UP

02:21:59.544 --> 02:22:01.279
SPENDING ON SOMETHING ELSE SO.

02:22:01.346 --> 02:22:02.113
THAT WAS A BIT OF A SHOCKING

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:04.349
POINT HERE --

02:22:04.415 --> 02:22:06.851
WILL YOU ALSO SPEAK I OR HER

02:22:06.918 --> 02:22:07.485
ALIVE DISCUSSION AT SPEAKING TO

02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:08.953
MANAGEMENT.

02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:11.022
YESTERDAY AND THE HEARING ONE

02:22:11.089 --> 02:22:11.656
CRITICAL PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAD

02:22:11.723 --> 02:22:12.957
AND THEN PER INDIVIDUAL HAD TO

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:14.259
WAIT FOR A COUPLE HOURS IN THE

02:22:14.325 --> 02:22:15.994
IRONY WAS NOT LOST ON ANY OF US

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:17.161
TO COMMENT ON THIS WAS.

02:22:17.228 --> 02:22:19.264
A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE DMV AND

02:22:19.330 --> 02:22:20.798
WHO SAID PLEASE SPEAK TO THE

02:22:20.865 --> 02:22:23.034
EMPLOYEES DON'T JUST VISIT WITH

02:22:23.101 --> 02:22:24.202
MANAGEMENT.

02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:25.203
AT THESE LOCATIONS EITHER IN

02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:26.571
SACRAMENTO ARE GOING TO THE

02:22:26.638 --> 02:22:28.373
OFFICES AND YOU MENTIONED YOU

02:22:28.439 --> 02:22:29.874
WOULD BE TALKING TO SUPERVISORS.

02:22:29.941 --> 02:22:31.142
CAN YOU PLEASE BE SURE TO

02:22:31.209 --> 02:22:32.844
INCLUDE IN YOUR WORK.

02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:35.013
TALKING TO EMPLOYEES LONGTIME

02:22:35.079 --> 02:22:36.748
SHORT TIME WHISTLEBLOWERS NON

02:22:36.814 --> 02:22:38.616
WHISTLEBLOWERS AND WE THINK IT

02:22:38.683 --> 02:22:39.984
IS I JUST DIDN'T HEAR THAT WORD

02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:41.686
AND AND THAT IN THE PROCESS THAT

02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:43.054
WAS GOING.

02:22:43.121 --> 02:22:46.090
GOING TO HAPPEN AND FINALLY --

02:22:46.157 --> 02:22:48.159
THE ABILITY.

02:22:48.226 --> 02:22:49.460
TO DETERMINE WHAT ELSE OTHER

02:22:49.527 --> 02:22:52.463
THAN REAL ID IS THE CAUSE OF

02:22:52.530 --> 02:22:54.165
PROBLEMS AT THE DMV A LOT OF

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:55.400
WHAT WE WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:56.267
IT MENTIONED AIR IN THE

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:57.568
DOCUMENTS THAT YOU'RE GETTING

02:22:57.635 --> 02:22:58.436
THE DMV CAUSING.

02:22:58.503 --> 02:23:00.004
THE HARM.

02:23:00.071 --> 02:23:02.140
BUT THERE'S LEVEL OF SERVICE.

02:23:02.206 --> 02:23:03.875
THAT IS NOT THE WAIT TIMES IS

02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:04.542
NOT THE ONLY ISSUE OUR

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:05.944
CONSTITUENTS ARE HAVING A

02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:06.577
PROBLEM WITH IT'S THE LEVEL OF

02:23:06.644 --> 02:23:08.379
SERVICE.

02:23:08.446 --> 02:23:10.815
AT THE DMV I DON'T SEE THAT IN

02:23:10.882 --> 02:23:12.250
THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT AS IT'S

02:23:12.317 --> 02:23:14.352
CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

THE STATUS OF HIRING AND ONE OF

02:23:41.112 --> 02:23:42.180
THE QUESTIONS AS I WAS SITTING

REAL ID IS GOING TO BE JUST THIS

02:23:49.587 --> 02:23:51.189
INFLUX EVERY SINGLE.

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:52.490
LICENSE HOLDER IN CALIFORNIA

02:23:52.557 --> 02:23:54.359
NEEDS TO GET A REAL ID AND THEY

02:23:54.425 --> 02:23:56.027
HAVE TO GOING TO A DMV OFFICE.

02:23:56.094 --> 02:23:57.128
THERE'S GONNA BE A FLOOD OF

02:23:57.195 --> 02:23:58.196
INDIVIDUALS WAS THEIR

02:23:58.262 --> 02:23:58.963
ANTICIPATION AND THEY'RE

02:23:59.030 --> 02:24:02.367
PLANNING [inaudible] TO HIRE.

02:24:02.433 --> 02:24:05.169
PEOPLE ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS --

02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:06.938
VERY SMALL EXAMPLE OF THAT IS UP

02:24:07.005 --> 02:24:08.373
TO US WITH REDISTRICTING WE KNEW

02:24:08.439 --> 02:24:09.407
WE WOULD BE.

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:10.942
SLAMMED WITH A LOT OF WORK A FEW

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:12.643
YEARS AGO WE HIRED SOME LIMITED

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:14.245
TERM FOLKS IN THAT AND THEY KNEW

02:24:14.312 --> 02:24:15.046
I'M GONNA BE WORKING FOR THE

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:16.247
AUDITOR'S OFFICE FOR A YEAR AND

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:17.315
THEN I'M DONE.

02:24:17.382 --> 02:24:18.649
SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:20.218
WOULD BE LOOKING --

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:21.486
FOR THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE THAT

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:23.788
ASKS US TO LOOK AT THINGS BEYOND

02:24:23.855 --> 02:24:25.023
REAL ID.

02:24:25.089 --> 02:24:26.758
ARE AS FAR AS DETERMINING

02:24:26.824 --> 02:24:27.825
WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OTHER

02:24:27.892 --> 02:24:30.061
FACTORS THAT REALLY AFFECTED

02:24:30.128 --> 02:24:32.063
DMV'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE

02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:34.098
TO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:24:34.165 --> 02:24:36.234
AND WHETHER OR NOT DMV HAS

02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.568
ADEQUATE PLANS TO ADDRESS THOUGH

02:24:37.635 --> 02:24:39.070

WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OF HAVE AND

02:24:40.638 --> 02:24:42.573

WE WERE WE ACTUALLY HAD SOMEWHAT

02:26:51.536 --> 02:26:52.270
SIMILAR.

02:26:52.336 --> 02:26:54.639
ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS --

02:26:54.705 --> 02:26:56.407
THIS ONGOING NEED TO INCREASE

02:26:56.474 --> 02:26:58.276
SERVICES AND THERE WAS

02:26:58.342 --> 02:26:58.809
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FIELD

02:26:58.876 --> 02:27:00.178
OFFICES.

02:27:00.244 --> 02:27:03.047
AND THERE WAS A STRATEGY AS AS A

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:04.282
SUMMER BAKER SAID AND ALLUDED TO

02:27:04.348 --> 02:27:07.985

WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THAT

02:27:20.765 --> 02:27:22.433
STRATEGY HAS AS WE HAVE WE

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:23.701
INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:29.207
AN ISSUE BUT HAVE.

02:27:29.273 --> 02:27:30.975
WHERE ARE WE ON THAT STRATEGY SO

02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:33.211
SO WE HAVE A PLAN WE ARE WORKING

02:27:33.277 --> 02:27:35.379

REQUESTS FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND

02:35:26.617 --> 02:35:27.618
FROM OUR MEMBERS THAN THEY CAN

02:35:27.685 --> 02:35:29.219
HANDLE.

02:35:29.286 --> 02:35:30.487
ON A WHOLE SLEW OF DIFFERENT

02:35:30.554 --> 02:35:32.056
TOUGH ISSUES.

02:35:32.122 --> 02:35:34.758
AND I JUST WONDER ARE WE GONNA

02:35:34.825 --> 02:35:36.126

02:35:37.695 --> 02:35:39.730
BUDGET ON THIS AUDIT --

02:35:39.797 --> 02:35:41.231
WHEN THAT BUDGET OUGHT TO BE

02:35:41.298 --> 02:35:42.700
GOING TO DIRECTLY ADDRESSING THE

LEGISLATURE FROM CONSTITUENTS.

02:35:53.477 --> 02:35:54.945

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:57.047

THIS THIS AUDIT.

02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:01.151
THE LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE TO

02:36:01.218 --> 02:36:02.519
SET UP SOME SORT OF SYSTEM TO

02:36:02.586 --> 02:36:03.754

WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE DON'T

02:38:30.767 --> 02:38:32.002
TAKE A POSITION ON AUDITS BUT

02:38:32.069 --> 02:38:34.671
BUT WHAT WE TYPICALLY THIS AUDIT.

02:38:34.738 --> 02:38:36.907
HAS STATEWIDE IMPACT.

02:38:36.974 --> 02:38:38.041
FROM THERE ARE SOME ODD IT'S

02:38:38.108 --> 02:38:39.710
THAT WE ARE ASKED TO DO BY THIS

02:38:39.776 --> 02:38:41.245
COMMITTEE AND BY MEMBERS THAT

02:38:41.311 --> 02:38:43.680
ARE VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON A

02:38:43.747 --> 02:38:45.315
SPECIFIC DISTRICT OR

02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:47.451
CONSTITUENCY --

02:38:47.517 --> 02:38:48.952
IF I WERE TO COMPARE THIS AUDIT

02:38:49.019 --> 02:38:50.854
TO SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT'S THE

02:38:50.921 --> 02:38:52.222
PERSPECTIVE I WOULD HAVE HONOR

02:38:52.289 --> 02:38:53.357
WE WOULD PUT A TEAM ON THIS

02:38:53.423 --> 02:38:54.958
AUDIT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THIS IS

02:38:55.025 --> 02:38:56.393
CLEARLY AN ISSUE THAT'S IN THE

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:57.160
FOREFRONT.

02:38:57.227 --> 02:39:00.397
OF EVERYBODY'S MIND BECAUSE SO

02:39:00.464 --> 02:39:02.065
MANY PEOPLE HAVE INTERACTIONS

02:39:02.132 --> 02:39:03.500
WITH DMV.

02:39:03.567 --> 02:39:05.369
BUT CERTAINLY IT'S THE

02:39:05.435 --> 02:39:07.004
COMMITTEES DISCRETION IF THE

02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:09.206
COMMITTEE FEELS THAT THERE ARE

02:39:09.273 --> 02:39:12.142
EFFORTS THAT DMV IS TAKING AND

02:39:12.209 --> 02:39:14.478
THEY DON'T YOU DON'T THINK NOW'S

02:39:14.544 --> 02:39:15.312
THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO AN

02:39:15.379 --> 02:39:16.046
AUDIT.

02:39:16.113 --> 02:39:17.614
MEAN UP OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO

02:39:17.681 --> 02:39:19.549
DEFER TO THE COMMITTEES --

02:39:19.616 --> 02:39:21.151
DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO

02:39:21.218 --> 02:39:23.287
THAT BUT BUT WHEN WHEN WE LOOKED

02:39:23.353 --> 02:39:26.890
AT AUDIT SENATOR WE TRY.

02:39:26.957 --> 02:39:27.491
TO EVEN IF WE DO GET AN AUDIT

02:39:27.557 --> 02:39:29.426
THAT'S MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED WE

02:39:29.493 --> 02:39:30.594
TRY.

02:39:30.661 --> 02:39:31.895
TO LOOK AT THE SCOPE AND SEE IF

02:39:31.962 --> 02:39:32.796
THEY'RE THINGS THAT WE CAN

02:39:32.863 --> 02:39:34.464
ANALYZE AND ASSESS THAT WILL

02:39:34.531 --> 02:39:36.500
HAVE AN IMPACT STATEWIDE ON

02:39:36.566 --> 02:39:37.434
CONSTITUENTS THROUGHOUT THE

02:39:37.501 --> 02:39:38.902
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS CLEARLY

02:39:38.969 --> 02:39:40.037
IS AN AUDIT THAT.

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:42.239
ALREADY THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT

02:39:42.306 --> 02:39:43.307
IS GOING.

02:39:43.373 --> 02:39:45.676
TO ARM TOUCH ON PRETTY MUCH

02:39:45.742 --> 02:39:47.044
EVERY MEMBER'S DISTRICT --

02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:49.846
AS FAR AS CONSTITUENTS HAVING TO

02:39:49.913 --> 02:39:51.281
TO DEAL WITH DMV I I I

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:52.316
APPRECIATE WHAT THE DIRECTOR

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:53.550
SAID I DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:39:53.617 --> 02:39:55.152
OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH THE HEARING

02:39:55.218 --> 02:39:55.852
YESTERDAY.

02:39:55.919 --> 02:39:57.487
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE

02:39:57.554 --> 02:39:59.890
TAKEN STEPS BOMB BUT WHAT THE

02:39:59.957 --> 02:40:02.526
MEMBERS ARE ASKING US TO DO IS.

02:40:02.592 --> 02:40:03.160
TO GET IN THERE AND ASSESS OKAY

02:40:03.226 --> 02:40:07.497
WHAT IS THE STEPS ARE THEY GOING

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:08.565
TO ANALYZE HEALTH EFFECTIVE

02:40:08.632 --> 02:40:10.167
THOSE STEPS ARE DO THEY HAVE

02:40:10.233 --> 02:40:11.635
PLANS IN PLACE TO COURSE CORRECT

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:14.071
IF THOSE STEPS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE.

02:40:14.137 --> 02:40:15.472
I THINK THAT SOME OF THE

02:40:15.539 --> 02:40:16.940
ANALYSIS THAT WE CAN DO AS FAR

02:40:17.007 --> 02:40:18.608
AS A SYSTEM.

02:40:18.675 --> 02:40:19.676
BOB WHAT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE

02:40:19.743 --> 02:40:21.178
YOU TO FINISH THIS.

02:40:21.244 --> 02:40:23.013
WELL AS I SAID IN A WHEN I

02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:24.381
PRESENTED THE THE ANALYSIS THAT

02:40:24.448 --> 02:40:26.583
THE AUDIT IS ITS BUDGET ABOUT

02:40:26.650 --> 02:40:27.184
TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR

02:40:27.250 --> 02:40:28.218
THE AUDIT TEAM.

02:40:28.285 --> 02:40:29.786
THAT JUST ONE AUDIT TEAM WOULD

02:40:29.853 --> 02:40:31.321
TAKE US ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS NOW

02:40:31.388 --> 02:40:32.956
WHAT WE COULD DO --

02:40:33.023 --> 02:40:34.791
IF THE COMMITTEE WANTED US TO

02:40:34.858 --> 02:40:36.493
GET THIS DONE BY A CERTAIN TIME

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:37.894
FRAME THE MEMBERS DIDN'T ASK FOR

02:40:37.961 --> 02:40:39.796
A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME --

02:40:39.863 --> 02:40:41.765
WE COULD PUT MORE THAN ONE TEAM

02:40:41.832 --> 02:40:43.066
ON THIS JOB BECAUSE WERE

02:40:43.133 --> 02:40:44.267
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO

02:40:44.334 --> 02:40:45.469
A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DISTRICT

02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:47.537
OFFICES SO INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:49.740
TEAM GOING FROM SACRAMENTO TO

02:40:49.806 --> 02:40:51.775
LOS ANGELES TO CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:40:51.842 --> 02:40:53.243
WE WOULD HAVE TEAMS OFGOING OUT

02:40:53.310 --> 02:40:55.012
CONCURRENTLY AND THAT WOULD CUT

02:40:55.078 --> 02:40:56.747
DOWN ON THE AMOUNT OF CALENDAR

02:40:56.813 --> 02:40:58.115
TIME IT WOULD TAKE US TO GET THE

02:40:58.181 --> 02:40:59.816
JOB DONE.

02:40:59.883 --> 02:41:01.218
BOB CESCA CHAIR INTO IS IT WOULD

02:41:01.284 --> 02:41:03.153
IT BE POSSIBLE YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:05.489
GOT SO SEVEN MONTH PROCESS I

02:41:05.555 --> 02:41:08.658
GUESS IT COULD BE SPED UP A BIT --

02:41:08.725 --> 02:41:10.594
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LITTLE LESS

02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:12.095
THAN A MONTH LEFT --

02:42:17.294 --> 02:42:18.562
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES.

02:42:18.628 --> 02:42:20.997
AS A COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE.

02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:22.332
YEAH ARTISTS AT IT AND IF I MAY

02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:23.700
MISTER CHAIR WITH ARMS PICKED UP

IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SO

02:42:25.102 --> 02:42:26.069
WE HAVE TAKE ABOUT ANYWAY YEAH I

02:42:26.136 --> 02:42:27.370
UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND I'M JUST

02:42:27.437 --> 02:42:28.872
ASKING IF WE IF.

02:42:28.939 --> 02:42:30.807
IF IT IF WE WANT. TO MY FOR

02:42:30.874 --> 02:42:33.176
TODAY ON I THINK PART OF WHAT'S

02:42:33.243 --> 02:42:38.448
WHAT'S YOU KNOW OUR YEAH THIS IS

02:42:38.515 --> 02:42:39.716
DIFFERENT THAN A TYPICAL REQUEST

02:42:39.783 --> 02:42:40.784
BECAUSE THE STATE WIDE SCOPE BUT

02:42:40.851 --> 02:42:44.054
IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT BECAUSE I

02:42:44.121 --> 02:42:47.624
WE'VE GOT A YEAH WE'VE GOT THE

02:42:47.691 --> 02:42:49.726
ATTENTION OF SOME OF THE AND THE

02:42:49.793 --> 02:42:50.360
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS WEIGHING.

02:42:50.427 --> 02:42:51.795
IN ON THIS I THINK THAT THE

02:42:51.862 --> 02:42:53.096
FOLKS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

02:42:53.163 --> 02:42:54.431
RECOGNIZE WHAT A PROBLEM THEY

02:42:54.498 --> 02:42:56.066
HAVE ON THEIR HANDS AYE I'M

02:42:56.133 --> 02:42:57.734
GETTING THE SENSE THAT DAY.

02:42:57.801 --> 02:42:58.802
OUR ARE TAKING SOME OWNERSHIP IN

02:42:58.869 --> 02:43:00.604
UNDERSTAND.

02:43:00.670 --> 02:43:02.439
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THEM TO

02:43:02.506 --> 02:43:03.740
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS ISSUE

02:43:03.807 --> 02:43:05.075
AND GET THESE ISSUES ADDRESSED A

02:43:05.142 --> 02:43:06.309
SAP?

02:43:06.376 --> 02:43:07.577
AND I THINK THAT HE'S PUTTING

02:43:07.644 --> 02:43:10.213
SOME PERSONAL --

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:12.015
CREDIBILITY ON THE LINE WITH

02:43:12.082 --> 02:43:13.316
REGARD TO THIS SO IT IN THAT

02:43:13.383 --> 02:43:14.618
SENSE IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT RIGHT

02:43:14.684 --> 02:43:15.852
IT'S NOT LIKE --

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:17.587
TYPICAL I REQUEST WHERE AND

02:43:17.654 --> 02:43:19.122
THERE'S NOT THIS LEVEL OF

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:20.223
COMMITMENT AND ATTENTION FROM

02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:22.993
THE HIGHER UPS IT WITHIN OUR

02:43:23.059 --> 02:43:24.694
SO I AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S

02:43:24.761 --> 02:43:27.264
THAT'S WHAT I AM --

02:43:27.330 --> 02:43:28.331
THAT'S ONE GRAPPLING WITH RIGHT

02:43:28.398 --> 02:43:30.767
NOW TO MY VOTE ON THIS ON THIS

02:43:30.834 --> 02:43:32.636
REQUEST ON THIS DAY [inaudible]

02:43:32.702 --> 02:43:34.304
MISTER CHAIR.

02:43:34.371 --> 02:43:35.639
THE I. O. RESPONSE TO SENATOR

02:43:35.705 --> 02:43:36.573
ALAN [inaudible]

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:38.441
YES.

02:43:38.508 --> 02:43:40.110
BUT CENTER AND I REALLY

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:40.744
APPRECIATE THE ONE IN QUESTION I

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:41.845
THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I

02:43:41.912 --> 02:43:42.612
WOULD SAY THAT.

02:43:42.679 --> 02:43:43.847
IF YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A

02:43:43.914 --> 02:43:45.115
PROBLEM THAT IS NEW.

02:43:45.182 --> 02:43:47.083
IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT HAS --

02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:47.984
BEEN GOING ON FOR A SHORT AMOUNT

02:43:48.051 --> 02:43:50.320
OF TIME IT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE

02:43:50.387 --> 02:43:50.987
TWO THOUSAND FIVE I THINK IT'S A

02:43:51.054 --> 02:43:52.956
CULTURAL ISSUE AND IT LASTS MORE

02:43:53.023 --> 02:43:54.357
THAN JUST A REAL ID ISSUE.

02:43:54.424 --> 02:43:56.893
I THINK HAVING THE AUDITOR WITH

02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:58.562
THEIR EXPERTISE TO RESOURCES AND

02:43:58.628 --> 02:44:00.697
BEING A INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE

02:44:00.764 --> 02:44:03.066
ENTITY LISELOTTE TO SWAY AND

02:44:03.133 --> 02:44:04.568
RESOURCES THAT WOULD HELP BUT

02:44:04.634 --> 02:44:06.703
DMB.

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:07.337
YES IT'S GOING TO THE GOVERNOR'S

02:44:07.404 --> 02:44:08.872
LEVEL IS GOING TO LEGISLATURE

02:44:08.939 --> 02:44:10.574
OFTEN BUT I THINK THAT'S WHY

02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:11.107
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE

02:44:11.174 --> 02:44:13.310
AUDITOR BRING THOSE RESOURCES TO

02:44:13.376 --> 02:44:16.112
DMV AND CANDIDLY I'M NOT SURE.

02:44:16.179 --> 02:44:18.782
THE DMV ALONE CAN HANDLE AND

02:44:18.848 --> 02:44:20.517
REPAIRED THE SITUATION I THINK

02:44:20.584 --> 02:44:22.185
THEY NEED RESOURCES TO HELP

02:44:22.252 --> 02:44:23.954
ALLEVIATE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE

02:44:24.020 --> 02:44:25.255
FACING RIGHT NOW ONE WOULD READ

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:26.823
THAT'S PRICEY MY CONCERN I GUESS

02:44:26.890 --> 02:44:28.058
WE'RE GONNA ASK THEM NOW TO

02:44:28.124 --> 02:44:30.026
SPEND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

02:44:30.093 --> 02:44:31.394
FUND THE AUDIT --

02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:32.629
WHEN YOU KNOW?

02:44:32.696 --> 02:44:34.598
WHEN THOSE RESOURCES NEED TO GO

02:44:34.664 --> 02:44:36.066
TOWARD ADDRESSING THE ISSUES AT

02:44:36.132 --> 02:44:37.434
HAND --

02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:40.203
THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S

02:44:40.270 --> 02:44:42.372
PART OF THE THE CHALLENGE RIGHT

02:44:42.439 --> 02:44:43.640
ON THAT WOULD COULD RELATE IT

02:44:43.707 --> 02:44:44.941
WILL FIND IT'S FUNNY I MEAN YOU.

02:44:45.008 --> 02:44:46.343
YOU DID NOT GIVE HIS NOTORIOUS

02:44:46.409 --> 02:44:48.011
AGGREGATE CALIFORNIA LIVES

02:44:48.078 --> 02:44:48.945
THERE'S OUR MOST --

02:44:49.012 --> 02:44:50.614
FAVORITE WHIPPING BOY --

02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:52.749
IN GOVERNMENT AYE AND YET I

02:44:52.816 --> 02:44:55.418
THINK WE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT

02:44:55.485 --> 02:44:56.286
IT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE FOR

02:44:56.353 --> 02:44:58.288
AWHILE --

02:44:58.355 --> 02:45:00.123
OUT FROM ITS.

02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:01.458
FROM FROM WHERE IT WAS --

02:45:01.524 --> 02:45:02.659
BACK WHEN I WAS A KID

02:45:02.726 --> 02:45:02.959
[inaudible]

02:45:03.026 --> 02:45:07.130
AND SO THIS SO IT'S SO SO NOW I

02:45:07.197 --> 02:45:07.697
THINK THE OF SOME OF THE OLD

02:45:07.764 --> 02:45:09.032
LEGACY IS.

02:45:09.099 --> 02:45:10.267
REARING ITS UGLY HEAD IT'S BEEN

02:45:10.333 --> 02:45:11.268
A CAN OF AN UNFORTUNATE

02:45:11.334 --> 02:45:13.870
CONFLUENCE OF FACTORS FOURTEEN

02:45:13.937 --> 02:45:15.505
SIXTY ONE AND REAL ID AND UP A

02:45:15.572 --> 02:45:17.807
BUNCH OF OF OF OF STRESSES IN

02:45:17.874 --> 02:45:18.708
AND PER AND AND IN EXACERBATIONS

02:45:18.775 --> 02:45:20.210
OF OF SOME EXISTING CULTURAL

02:45:20.277 --> 02:45:21.378
PROBLEMS WITHIN THAT WITHIN THE

02:45:21.444 --> 02:45:23.079
DEPARTMENT BUT I DO THINK.

02:45:23.146 --> 02:45:25.882
THAT THEY ARE AND I DO THINK

02:45:25.949 --> 02:45:27.083
THAT THEY THEY'VE IMPROVED QUITE

02:45:27.150 --> 02:45:28.018
A BIT --

02:45:28.084 --> 02:45:29.386
SINCE SINCE I WAS YOUNGER THOUGH

02:45:29.452 --> 02:45:29.819
THE NOW [inaudible]

02:45:29.886 --> 02:45:31.788
YOU KNOW.

02:45:31.855 --> 02:45:33.123
THEY'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW SET OF

02:45:33.189 --> 02:45:36.026
PROBLEMS SO IT'S IT'S AND IT'S A

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:37.661
IT'S A IT'S IT I THINK I JUST

02:45:37.727 --> 02:45:38.962
BECOMES A CHALLENGE OF HOW HOW

02:45:39.029 --> 02:45:40.163
DO WE MAKE SURE WE'RE USING OUR

02:45:40.230 --> 02:45:41.598
MONEY EFFECTIVELY AND HOW HOW DO

02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:42.532
WE MAKE SURE THAT --

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:44.401
THAT THAT.

02:45:44.467 --> 02:45:45.902
YOU KNOW I I GUESS IT COMES DOWN

02:45:45.969 --> 02:45:47.137
A TRUST ISSUE IT SEEMS LIKE

02:45:47.203 --> 02:45:48.805
THERE'S SOME FOLKS HERE WHO.

02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:50.540
FEEL AS THOUGH I THE DEPARTMENT

02:45:50.607 --> 02:45:52.575
LEADERSHIP IS IS LOST THE TRUST

02:45:52.642 --> 02:45:54.210
OF THE COMMITTEE ON THOSE OF US

02:45:54.277 --> 02:45:55.045
WHO WE KNOW WE'RE HEARING FROM

02:45:55.111 --> 02:45:56.379
THEM THAT THEY'VE HEARD THIS

02:45:56.446 --> 02:45:57.247
PROBLEM LOUD AND CLEAR IN THE

02:45:57.314 --> 02:45:58.114
DAY.

02:45:58.181 --> 02:45:59.149
I KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND

02:45:59.215 --> 02:46:00.417
AND THEY'RE READY TO BE HELD

02:46:00.483 --> 02:46:01.651
ACCOUNTABLE BY US.

02:46:01.718 --> 02:46:03.153
AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE

02:46:03.219 --> 02:46:06.956
DILEMMA THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW.

02:46:07.023 --> 02:46:11.294
THANK YOU SENATOR FULLER --

02:46:11.361 --> 02:46:12.429
I'M NOT GOING TO GO BACK INTO

02:46:12.495 --> 02:46:13.563
THE DETAILS OF THE PROBLEM

02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:14.898
ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE DOCUMENTED

02:46:14.964 --> 02:46:17.400
FROM MY AND AT MY OWN OFFICES

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:18.468

02:46:18.535 --> 02:46:19.669
ON CERTAIN DAYS AND CERTAIN

02:46:19.736 --> 02:46:20.537
TIMES AND IT STE [inaudible]

02:46:20.603 --> 02:46:22.105
IT'S TERRIBLE.

02:46:22.172 --> 02:46:23.707
SO -- I HAVE

02:46:23.773 --> 02:46:25.842
A FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU --

02:46:25.909 --> 02:46:27.477
TO SEE IF THIS IS INDEED A

02:46:27.544 --> 02:46:29.079
SYSTEM WIDE PROBLEM WHICH IT

VITAL SERVICES FOR THE STATE OF

THINK WE NEED TO PUT IT AT THE

02:46:56.539 --> 02:46:57.774
TOP OF THE LIST.

02:46:57.841 --> 02:47:00.477

MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM BY

DAYS A NUMBER THE NUMBER OF DAYS

02:49:32.795 --> 02:49:34.631
YOU CAN ALSO BETTER ESTIMATE

02:49:34.697 --> 02:49:35.865
WHAT YOUR SERVICES INSTEAD OF

02:49:35.932 --> 02:49:37.133
JUST SAYING OKAY I'M GONNA PUT

02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:38.034
SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE ON

02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:39.536
SATURDAY SOMEWHERE --

02:49:39.602 --> 02:49:40.937
BECAUSE THEY GOT AWAY TIME AND

02:49:41.004 --> 02:49:41.971
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THE WAIT

02:49:42.038 --> 02:49:43.273
TIMES ARE REPORTED REPORTED

02:49:43.339 --> 02:49:44.541
ACCURATELY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

02:49:44.607 --> 02:49:45.608
IF THEY'RE REPORTING FROM THE

02:49:45.675 --> 02:49:46.843
TIME THEY PICK AT THE TAKE THE

02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:48.111
WINDOW OR IF THEY'RE REPORTING

02:49:48.177 --> 02:49:49.412
FROM THE MINUTE THEY GET THE

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:51.648
LINE AT THE BACK OF THE LINE --

02:49:51.714 --> 02:49:53.316
WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:49:53.383 --> 02:49:54.584
A SYSTEM WIDE.

02:49:54.651 --> 02:49:56.486
PICTURE AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK

02:49:56.553 --> 02:49:58.187
THE AUDITOR CAN DO ON FIVE

02:49:58.254 --> 02:50:00.323
LEVELS ONE IS ON JUST THE

02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:01.758
TECHNICAL PROCESSES WHICH IS

02:50:01.824 --> 02:50:03.159
IMMEDIATE MANAGING THE CROWD

02:50:03.226 --> 02:50:04.994
REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF OF THE

02:50:05.061 --> 02:50:06.663
SERVICE TIME THAT.

02:50:06.729 --> 02:50:07.830
THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE PEOPLE

02:50:07.897 --> 02:50:09.465
THAT COME AND AHEAD OF TIME SO

02:50:09.532 --> 02:50:10.400
YOU HAVE.

02:50:10.466 --> 02:50:11.701
YOU HAVE A PREDICTIVE MODE THE

02:50:11.768 --> 02:50:12.936
YOU CAN DISCUSS FOR THE UNIONS

02:50:13.002 --> 02:50:13.570
OR WHATEVER PUT YOUR PEOPLE OUT

02:50:13.636 --> 02:50:15.838
THERE -- AND

02:50:15.905 --> 02:50:17.006
PUT SOME OF THAT ON ON THE

02:50:17.073 --> 02:50:18.408
WEBSITE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE

02:50:18.474 --> 02:50:19.676
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CURE THE

02:50:19.742 --> 02:50:21.010
PROBLEM YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IN

02:50:21.077 --> 02:50:21.911
THESE ARE YOUR GOALS TO GET THE

02:50:21.978 --> 02:50:23.780
WAIT TIME DOWN.

02:50:23.846 --> 02:50:25.615
NUMBER ONE THAT'S I THINK THAT'S

02:50:25.682 --> 02:50:27.417
NUMBER ONE THAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN

02:50:27.483 --> 02:50:28.351
NUMBER TWO IS CUSTOMER SERVICE

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:29.986
JUST YOUR SAYING REAL IDEAS THE

02:50:30.053 --> 02:50:31.754
WHOLE PROBLEM BUT IT'S BEEN

02:50:31.821 --> 02:50:33.189
THIRTEEN YEARS OR SOMETHING

02:50:33.256 --> 02:50:34.390
SINCE WE KNEW ABOUT REAL ID.

02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:35.658
SAW HOW MUCH TIME IS THAT

02:50:35.725 --> 02:50:37.260
ACTUALLY ADDED THE SYSTEM HOW

02:50:37.327 --> 02:50:40.029
MUCH TIME HAS EVERYTHING ELSE

02:50:40.096 --> 02:50:41.631
ADDED TO THE SYSTEM.

02:50:41.698 --> 02:50:43.800
AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN GETTING

02:50:43.866 --> 02:50:45.234
THE WAIT TIMES DOWN BY DOING

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:46.235
SOMETHING BY JUST TRYING TO PAY

02:50:46.302 --> 02:50:47.804
OVERTIME AND US JUST LIKE THIS

02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:49.105
AND YOU MONEY TO PAY OVERTIME

02:50:49.172 --> 02:50:50.607
AND EMPLOYEES TO SKILLET BURNED

02:50:50.673 --> 02:50:51.341
OUT.

02:50:51.407 --> 02:50:52.875
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED IF

02:50:52.942 --> 02:50:54.344
THIS IF WE DON'T BENCHMARK THIS

02:50:54.410 --> 02:50:55.478
SYSTEM.

02:50:55.545 --> 02:50:58.982
AND I THINK THE THE WHOLE

02:50:59.048 --> 02:51:00.083
CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS BEEN

02:51:00.149 --> 02:51:02.719
TOUCHED ON THAT'S LIKE PLATFORM.

02:51:02.785 --> 02:51:04.087
TO ADD TREATMENT OF PEOPLE

02:51:04.153 --> 02:51:05.788
NEEDING SERVICE HOW DO YOU HOW

02:51:05.855 --> 02:51:07.090
IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR THOSE

02:51:07.156 --> 02:51:09.092
OFFICES THAT HAVE SAT THERE AND

02:51:09.158 --> 02:51:09.993
THE ADMINISTRATION NEVER EVEN

02:51:10.059 --> 02:51:11.094
HEARD ABOUT IT NOBODY'S EVEN

02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:12.195
DOING IT THAT WOULD PREFER

02:51:12.261 --> 02:51:13.396
FEIGNING OUT THERE.

02:51:13.463 --> 02:51:15.398
AND HUNT THEM IN THE NEWSPAPERS

02:51:15.465 --> 02:51:17.300
FINDING OUT BUT NO ONE ELSE IN

02:51:17.367 --> 02:51:19.068
THE ADMINISTRATION IS.

02:51:19.135 --> 02:51:21.404
SO THE WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE

02:51:21.471 --> 02:51:22.472
TREATMENT DOWN THE ROAD YOU'RE

02:51:22.538 --> 02:51:23.606
GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF

02:51:23.673 --> 02:51:24.674
QUALITY CONTROL [inaudible]

02:51:24.741 --> 02:51:28.745
AND PERHAPS THE AUDIT CAN HELP

02:51:28.811 --> 02:51:31.347
YOU DOCUMENT Y. BENCHMARK.

02:51:31.414 --> 02:51:33.516
WHERE YOU CAN PUT THE MOST

02:51:33.583 --> 02:51:36.185
RESOURCES FIRST TO MAKE THE MOST

02:51:36.252 --> 02:51:37.954
IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE AND THAT

02:51:38.021 --> 02:51:40.223
WOULD BE SO THE SECONDARY?

02:51:40.289 --> 02:51:41.924
ISSUE THAT THEY CAN HELP WITH.

02:51:41.991 --> 02:51:44.093
I THINK AND THE NEXT THING THAT

02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:45.294
THEY CAN HELP WITH WAS HR

02:51:45.361 --> 02:51:47.163
IMPLEMENTATION.

02:51:47.230 --> 02:51:48.898
SO WHAT IS YOUR AGE ARE

02:51:48.965 --> 02:51:50.800
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR

02:51:50.867 --> 02:51:52.235
SURGES ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR

02:51:52.301 --> 02:51:53.936
CUSTOMER FLOW TIME IS A MUCH

02:51:54.003 --> 02:51:55.338
INCREASED TIMAEUS.

02:51:55.405 --> 02:51:57.473
AND WHAT IS YOUR WHAT IS YOUR

02:51:57.540 --> 02:51:59.275
ROLE OUT FOR ONLINE SERVICES

02:51:59.342 --> 02:52:00.677
THAT A RETIEF.

02:52:00.743 --> 02:52:03.212
WHAT'S ROUTINE WHAT'S EMERGENCY

02:52:03.279 --> 02:52:05.848
AND WHAT HAS TO BE DONE BY YOU.

02:52:05.915 --> 02:52:07.450
AND DO HAVE A DESPERATE THAT CAN

02:52:07.517 --> 02:52:09.018
YOU SHARE THAT WITH US IF YOU

02:52:09.085 --> 02:52:10.486
CAN THAT WOULD BE I THINK

02:52:10.553 --> 02:52:11.854
HELPFUL WE MIGHT EVEN WANT TO

02:52:11.921 --> 02:52:13.790
HAVE A SPECIAL SESSION AND MOVE

02:52:13.856 --> 02:52:15.224
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. TO HELP

02:52:15.291 --> 02:52:17.093
YOU.

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:18.594
BUT COMING IN AND SAYING.

02:52:18.661 --> 02:52:19.962
WELL WE A LOT MORE WORK FROM

02:52:20.029 --> 02:52:21.531
EVERYBODY BECAUSE MONEY BUT WE

02:52:21.597 --> 02:52:22.665
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE.

02:52:22.732 --> 02:52:24.333
EXACTLY WENT.

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:25.935
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE

02:52:26.002 --> 02:52:26.869
MAGNITUDE SYSTEM WIDE OF THE

02:52:26.936 --> 02:52:29.272
PROBLEM.

02:52:29.338 --> 02:52:30.406
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP LIKE

02:52:30.473 --> 02:52:31.774
WORKING OUT SERVICING CUSTOMERS

02:52:31.841 --> 02:52:33.409
AND BEST PRACTICES.

02:52:33.476 --> 02:52:34.510
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP ANY OF

02:52:34.577 --> 02:52:35.044
US EVEN THOUGH IT'S WELL

02:52:35.111 --> 02:52:36.479
INTENDED AND THAT'S PROBABLY ALL

02:52:36.546 --> 02:52:37.213
YOU CAN DO WITHOUT WATER

02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:38.481
RESOURCES AND WITHOUT US HAVING

02:52:38.548 --> 02:52:39.749
A BETTER PICTURE.

02:52:39.816 --> 02:52:42.318
LAST BUT NOT LEAST I THINK YOU

02:52:42.385 --> 02:52:43.519
NEED -- TO

02:52:43.586 --> 02:52:45.822
LET US KNOW WHAT THE EMERGENCY

02:52:45.888 --> 02:52:47.090
SERVICES NEEDS ARE BECAUSE

02:52:47.156 --> 02:52:50.526
THAT'S THAT THAT'S GONNA GET IN.

02:52:50.593 --> 02:52:51.694
THAT'S IT IS EVERYWHERE AND

02:52:51.761 --> 02:52:52.195
THOSE ARE PARTICULARLY

02:52:52.261 --> 02:52:53.730
TRAVELLERS WHO LOSE THEIR

02:52:53.796 --> 02:52:54.363
DRIVER'S LICENSE THOSE KINDS OF

02:52:54.430 --> 02:52:55.231
PEOPLE.

02:52:55.298 --> 02:52:56.466
WHO ABSOLUTELY ARE STRANDED

02:52:56.532 --> 02:52:58.601
SOMEWHERE NOW THEY CANNOT GO TO

02:52:58.668 --> 02:53:00.870
THAT DIEM THE AWAY FIVE HOURS?

02:53:00.937 --> 02:53:02.905
SO I THINK THE AUDITOR COULD

02:53:02.972 --> 02:53:06.409
HELP US GAIN INSIGHT INTO THAT

02:53:06.476 --> 02:53:08.111
IF WE MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY AND

02:53:08.177 --> 02:53:09.712
MAYBE WE COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM

02:53:09.779 --> 02:53:11.914
OF ROLLING OUT RESOURCES BETTER.

02:53:11.981 --> 02:53:15.585
IF WE UNDERSTOOD THIS SYSTEM IS

02:53:15.651 --> 02:53:17.653
OVERBURDENED IN WHAT WAYS AND

02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:19.822
WHAT SPECIFIC.

02:53:19.889 --> 02:53:21.691
THE CIVIC HAPPENINGS LAST BUT

02:53:21.758 --> 02:53:24.026
NOT LEAST --

02:53:24.093 --> 02:53:25.561

WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING AUDIT --

03:05:34.022 --> 03:05:35.791
THERE'S NO STATE AGENCY THAT

03:05:35.858 --> 03:05:37.259
TOUCHES THE LIVES OF MORE

03:05:37.326 --> 03:05:38.994

03:05:39.061 --> 03:05:40.496
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR

HAS WEIGHED IN ON THIS AND THAT --

03:05:42.998 --> 03:05:45.234
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER

03:09:26.555 --> 03:09:28.156
FISCAL INEFFICIENCIES.

03:09:28.223 --> 03:09:30.325
SO THEY CHOSE IN TWO THOUSAND

03:09:30.392 --> 03:09:32.027
SIXTEEN TO PUT OUT A REQUEST FOR

03:09:32.094 --> 03:09:34.296

PHARMACIES BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE

03:09:43.572 --> 03:09:44.740

03:09:50.178 --> 03:09:51.546
BENEFICIARIES.

03:09:51.613 --> 03:09:52.614
THE LARGEST PROBLEM FOR

03:09:52.681 --> 03:09:53.515
PHARMACIES HAS BEEN THE

03:09:53.582 --> 03:09:56.151

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS.

03:10:08.797 --> 03:10:10.232
THIS IS BECAUSE MANY INDEPENDENT

03:10:10.298 --> 03:10:11.733
PHARMACIES TO GET BACK PAYMENTS

03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:12.901
THAT WERE IN THEIR MINDS ARE

03:10:12.968 --> 03:10:15.036
READY BELOW THE COST OF THE

03:10:15.103 --> 03:10:16.404
DRUGS THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED.

03:10:16.471 --> 03:10:17.439
MANY OF THESE FARMERS HIS

03:10:17.506 --> 03:10:18.874

03:10:18.940 --> 03:10:20.375

INTERFERE WITH THE LITIGATION

IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A SUPERIOR

03:20:42.997 --> 03:20:44.065
COURT MATTER WHICH IS VERY

03:20:44.132 --> 03:20:45.900
DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN AT

03:22:52.326 --> 03:22:53.461
LAWSUIT HERE.

03:22:53.528 --> 03:22:55.162
A FLEA YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE

03:22:55.229 --> 03:22:56.130
CONCERNS WE HAVE IS THAT THAT

03:22:56.197 --> 03:22:59.400
THE FIRST HEARING OF THE LAWSUIT

03:22:59.467 --> 03:23:01.035
IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN DECEMBER

03:23:01.102 --> 03:23:02.303

03:23:07.141 --> 03:23:09.610
AUDIT REPORT COMING OUT RIGHT IN

03:23:09.677 --> 03:23:11.946
THE MIDDLE OF OF THE LAWSUIT

03:23:12.013 --> 03:23:13.548
THAT'S FOCUSING ON THE VERY.

03:23:13.614 --> 03:23:15.016
ISSUES I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE

03:23:15.082 --> 03:23:16.817
THEY'RE OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT

03:23:16.884 --> 03:23:18.519
THE COURT OF LAW AND THE

03:23:18.586 --> 03:23:19.487
PLAINTIFFS ARE LOOKING AT THAT

03:23:19.554 --> 03:23:21.322
THE AUDIT REPORTS GOING TO COME

03:23:21.389 --> 03:23:22.290
OUT WITH SOME SORT OF

03:23:22.356 --> 03:23:24.692
CONCLUSIONS AND AN OVERLAP AND

03:23:24.759 --> 03:23:26.894
SO. ONE WE ARE CONCERNED WITH

03:23:26.961 --> 03:23:28.696
WITH HOW THIS COULD INFLUENCE

03:23:28.763 --> 03:23:30.364
ANY PARTICULAR COURT CASE AND

03:23:30.431 --> 03:23:32.166
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE

03:23:32.233 --> 03:23:34.201
IS SOME REDUNDANCY AND OVERLAP

03:23:34.268 --> 03:23:35.803
WITH TWO INDEPENDENT ENTITIES

03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:37.738
LOOK AT THAT THE SAME ISSUES.

03:23:37.805 --> 03:23:38.306
THAT'S HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO

03:23:38.372 --> 03:23:39.941
RESPOND.

03:23:40.007 --> 03:23:41.676
WELL AS AS AS MY CHIEF COUNSEL

03:23:41.742 --> 03:23:42.743
INDICATED WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE

03:23:42.810 --> 03:23:45.179
LITIGATION SO IT'S HARD FOR US.

03:23:45.246 --> 03:23:46.314
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE

03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:48.282
SCOPE THAT CENTER STONE AND AND

03:23:48.349 --> 03:23:49.984
MISTER COST ARE ASKING US TO

03:23:50.051 --> 03:23:50.518
CONDUCT.

03:23:50.585 --> 03:23:52.453
HAS OVERLAP OR NOT I MEAN IF

03:23:52.520 --> 03:23:54.155
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE IT

03:23:54.221 --> 03:23:55.690
THERE IS OVERLAP WERE SENSITIVE

03:23:55.756 --> 03:23:56.591
TO THAT.

03:23:56.657 --> 03:23:57.692
AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE INTO

03:23:57.758 --> 03:24:00.127
CONSIDERATION WHAT WE CAN REPORT

03:24:00.194 --> 03:24:01.262
OUT -- ONCE

03:24:01.329 --> 03:24:02.296
WE COMPLETE THE AUDIT BECAUSE

03:24:02.363 --> 03:24:03.931
OUR ATTORNEY AND AS I SAID I

03:24:03.998 --> 03:24:05.199
HAVE AN ATTORNEY ASSIGNED EVERY

03:24:05.266 --> 03:24:06.167
AUDIT THAT ATTORNEY WILL BE

03:24:06.233 --> 03:24:07.868
TRACKING THAT LITIGATION.

03:24:07.935 --> 03:24:08.970
AND INFORMING ME AND INFORMING

03:24:09.036 --> 03:24:11.138
THE AUDIT.

03:24:11.205 --> 03:24:12.373
GOING THERE IS OVERLAP WE'VE HAD

03:24:12.440 --> 03:24:14.942
OTHER AUDITS WHERE THAT HAS

03:24:15.009 --> 03:24:16.010
OCCURRED AND WHAT WE DID WE

03:24:16.077 --> 03:24:18.212
WOULD HAVE WE'VE HAD TO BACK OFF.

03:24:18.279 --> 03:24:19.480
AND BASICALLY DISCLOSE IN THE

03:24:19.547 --> 03:24:21.282
FINAL REPORT.

03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:22.383
THAT WE COULD REPORT OUT ON A

03:24:22.450 --> 03:24:24.418
PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE THERE

03:24:24.485 --> 03:24:25.920
WAS OVERLAP AND IT WOULD IN OUR

03:24:25.987 --> 03:24:27.688
VIEW BASED ON ADVICE FROM

03:24:27.755 --> 03:24:28.556
COUNSEL.

03:24:28.623 --> 03:24:29.624
WOULD HAVE INTERFERED SO WE

03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:30.891
WOULD WE WOULD DOWN TO BE

03:24:30.958 --> 03:24:32.593
CAREFUL ABOUT THAT.

03:24:32.660 --> 03:24:33.928
NONE OF THAT HELPS DENNIS US TO

03:24:33.995 --> 03:24:35.396
ME THAT NOW WOULD NOT ONLY WOULD

03:24:35.463 --> 03:24:37.531
YOU BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BUT AS

03:24:37.598 --> 03:24:39.634
A GENERAL.

03:24:39.700 --> 03:24:42.003
POLICY YEAH YOU ARE YOU ARE

03:24:42.069 --> 03:24:44.605
PRECLUDED FROM ADDRESSING.

03:24:44.672 --> 03:24:47.274
THE FACTUAL ISSUES THAT ARE THE

03:24:47.341 --> 03:24:47.808
SUBJECT MATTER OF PENDING

03:24:47.875 --> 03:24:49.210
LITIGATION.

03:24:49.276 --> 03:24:50.544
THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S UNDER THE

03:24:50.611 --> 03:24:51.912
UNDER THE AUDIT STANDARDS THAT

03:24:51.979 --> 03:24:54.849
WE FOLLOW WE ARE PRECLUDED FROM.

03:24:54.915 --> 03:24:56.817
IT IT THE WAY A STANDARD BREEDS

03:24:56.884 --> 03:24:57.752
AS WE HAD WE CANNOT INTERFERE

03:24:57.818 --> 03:24:59.286
WITH AN ONGOING WE CANNOT

03:24:59.353 --> 03:25:01.122
CONDUCT AUDIT WORK THAT COULD

03:25:01.188 --> 03:25:01.856
POTENTIALLY INTERFERE WITH AN

03:25:01.922 --> 03:25:02.890
ONGOING INVESTIGATION OR

03:25:02.957 --> 03:25:03.791
LITIGATION.

03:25:03.858 --> 03:25:05.993
SO AGAIN THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

03:25:06.060 --> 03:25:07.695
USING OUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT.

03:25:07.762 --> 03:25:08.963
AND I'M CERTAINLY SEEKING ADVICE

03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:10.131
FROM COUNSEL AND THEN WE MAKE A

03:25:10.197 --> 03:25:11.599
DETERMINATION WE CAN'T EVEN GO

03:25:11.666 --> 03:25:14.602
THERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.

03:25:14.669 --> 03:25:16.070
TO A AND WE WOULD HAVE TO INFORM

03:25:16.137 --> 03:25:17.071
THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WE ISSUE

03:25:17.138 --> 03:25:18.873
THE REPORT PUBLICLY THAT WE

03:25:18.939 --> 03:25:20.041
DIDN'T LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR

03:25:20.107 --> 03:25:20.908
ISSUE.

03:25:20.975 --> 03:25:22.309
IT HAPPENED ON THE MONTEBELLO

03:25:22.376 --> 03:25:23.944
AUDIT THAT WE DID OFFER SENATOR

03:25:24.011 --> 03:25:25.379
I THINK SENATOR MENDOZA AND

03:25:25.446 --> 03:25:26.380
OTHER MEMBERS REQUESTED THAT

03:25:26.447 --> 03:25:27.114
AUDIT.

03:25:27.181 --> 03:25:28.783
THERE WAS A THERE WAS ONGOING

03:25:28.849 --> 03:25:30.217
LITIGATION RELATED TO

03:25:30.284 --> 03:25:32.720
CONTRACTING PRACTICES AND WE DID

03:25:32.787 --> 03:25:34.555
SOME WORK IN THAT AREA BUT BASED

03:25:34.622 --> 03:25:36.490
ON COUNSEL'S ADVICE AND LOOKING

03:25:36.557 --> 03:25:37.758
AND MEETING WITH THE TEAM.

03:25:37.825 --> 03:25:39.360
I MADE THE DECISION WE CAN'T

03:25:39.427 --> 03:25:40.861
REPORT OUT ON THAT BECAUSE

03:25:40.928 --> 03:25:42.496
THERE'S ONGOING LITIGATION.

03:25:42.563 --> 03:25:45.700
AND OUR CONCLUSIONS MAY BE.

03:25:45.766 --> 03:25:46.867
PROBLEMATIC --

03:25:46.934 --> 03:25:48.602
NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:25:48.669 --> 03:25:50.137
LITIGATION IT COULD INFLUENCE

03:25:50.204 --> 03:25:50.871
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE WOULD

03:25:50.938 --> 03:25:51.839
WANT TO GO THERE BECAUSE WE

03:25:51.906 --> 03:25:53.674
CAN'T WITH STANDARDS SO WE WOULD

03:25:53.741 --> 03:25:55.176
CONDUCT OURSELVES THE SAME WAY

03:25:55.242 --> 03:25:56.310
IF THIS AUDITS APPROVED

HAVE THAT INDEPENDENCE NECESSARY

03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:58.518

SHORTLY.

03:42:25.398 --> 03:42:26.833
THE CENTRAL ISSUE WHICH

03:42:26.900 --> 03:42:30.036
ADDRESSES I THINK MOST OF THE

03:42:30.103 --> 03:42:31.504
ISSUES RAISED BY SENATOR GAINES

03:42:31.571 --> 03:42:33.339

SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR --

03:42:42.315 --> 03:42:43.049
AND I'LL COME BACK TO THAT

03:42:43.116 --> 03:42:44.417
MOMENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

03:42:44.484 --> 03:42:46.386
REALLY THE CRUX OF OF ALMOST ALL

03:42:46.453 --> 03:42:49.556
OF THESE ISSUES --

03:42:49.622 --> 03:42:51.191
BOB MY FIRST PRIORITY OUR FIRST

03:42:51.257 --> 03:42:52.826

NEPOTISM POLICY.

03:42:59.999 --> 03:43:01.101

03:43:04.270 --> 03:43:06.473
HOTLINE TO REPORT MISCONDUCT.

03:43:06.539 --> 03:43:07.540
WE CONDUCTED AN EMPLOYEE

03:43:07.607 --> 03:43:08.641

DEPARTMENT'S FIRST TO SERVE AS A

03:43:10.577 --> 03:43:12.212
BENCH LINE FOR AN ANNUAL PLAYING.

03:43:12.278 --> 03:43:13.913
COMPLAIN GATE THAT SURVEY --

03:43:13.980 --> 03:43:15.448

WE'VE RESTRUCTURED TO CREATE A

03:43:22.555 --> 03:43:24.691
CFO ORGANIZATION TO BRING

03:43:24.758 --> 03:43:25.592
TIGHTER FINANCIAL CONTROLS TO

AROUND THE STATE SO PEOPLE DO

03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:36.469
NOT THAT DIFFERENT TAX OUTCOMES.

03:43:36.536 --> 03:43:37.537
DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE IN

03:43:37.604 --> 03:43:38.571
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH

03:43:38.638 --> 03:43:39.172
WAS PREVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH

03:43:39.239 --> 03:43:41.407
DEPARTMENT --

03:43:41.474 --> 03:43:42.842
WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO IMPROVE

03:43:42.909 --> 03:43:44.544
EFFICIENCY WHICH I TAKE VERY

03:43:44.611 --> 03:43:46.346
SERIOUSLY THE DEPARTMENT GIVEN

03:43:46.412 --> 03:43:46.913
THE PUBLIC FUNDS THAT WERE

03:43:46.980 --> 03:43:47.714
EXPANDING.

03:43:47.781 --> 03:43:49.249
ARE THAT INVOLVES BOTH PROCESS

03:43:49.315 --> 03:43:50.917
RE ENGINEERING AND IMPROVE USE

03:43:50.984 --> 03:43:52.786
OF TECHNOLOGY OF JUST ONE

03:43:52.852 --> 03:43:54.554
EXAMPLE WE'VE TAKEN OUR OFFERING

03:43:54.621 --> 03:43:55.955
COMPROMISE PROGRAM.

03:43:56.022 --> 03:43:57.891
UP FROM A NINE MONTH PROCESS

03:43:57.957 --> 03:43:59.392
ALREADY DOWN TO ONE MONTH

03:43:59.459 --> 03:44:01.761
PROCESS AND AND THERE'S MORE TO

03:44:01.828 --> 03:44:04.297
BE DONE IN VARIOUS ITEMS.

03:44:04.364 --> 03:44:06.032
WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY A

03:44:06.099 --> 03:44:08.301
LET ME TURN TO THE CROSS?

03:44:08.368 --> 03:44:09.302
ISSUE NOW WHICH IS AT THE HEART

03:44:09.369 --> 03:44:12.972
OF BOTH THE ISSUES ABOUT THE

03:44:13.039 --> 03:44:14.641
DIFFICULTY OF THE NEW SYSTEM IT

03:44:14.707 --> 03:44:16.810
ALSO IS AT THE HEART OF THE CALL

03:44:16.876 --> 03:44:18.845
CENTER ISSUES THAT THE CALL WAIT

03:44:18.912 --> 03:44:20.413
TIMES AND BUSY SIGNALS.

03:44:20.480 --> 03:44:21.714
AS WELL AS ITS REALLY THE HEART

03:44:21.781 --> 03:44:23.716
OF THE THE BUDGET NUMBERS THAT

03:44:23.783 --> 03:44:25.018
SENATOR GAINES BOTTOM.

03:44:25.084 --> 03:44:26.619
SUGGESTED AS WELL.

03:44:26.686 --> 03:44:28.922
ODD SO CROSS --

03:44:28.988 --> 03:44:30.356
IS A CUSTOMIZED OFF THE SHELF

03:44:30.423 --> 03:44:33.059
SOFTWARE WHICH WAS PROCURED BY

03:44:33.126 --> 03:44:34.661

BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CSUS THE

03:44:36.596 --> 03:44:38.698
CONTRACT HOME RICHARD PRIOR TO

03:44:38.765 --> 03:44:42.802
THE HIVE CREATION OF CTF A IT IS

03:44:42.869 --> 03:44:43.870

STATES INCLUDING BY EDIE DE --

03:44:53.213 --> 03:44:56.115
THERE ARE REAL BENEFITS TO GOING --

03:44:56.182 --> 03:44:59.018
TO A NEW MODERN PLATFORM --

03:44:59.085 --> 03:45:00.453
THE INC ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY

03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:01.754
WILL LEAD TO US BEING BECOMING

03:45:01.821 --> 03:45:02.655
MORE NIMBLE.

03:45:02.722 --> 03:45:04.490
AND SHOULD INCREASE REVENUE OVER

03:45:04.557 --> 03:45:06.192
TIME -- THE

03:45:06.259 --> 03:45:07.794

A TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC ISSUE

03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:49.869
THE NEXT DAY HOPEFULLY WE PEOPLE

03:45:49.936 --> 03:45:50.737
DON'T HAVE THOSE.

03:45:50.803 --> 03:45:53.973

WITH THE THIRD SCHEDULED.

03:48:54.821 --> 03:48:56.255
WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE PROCEDURES

03:48:56.322 --> 03:48:57.990
TO SEPARATE OTA FROM THE TAX

03:48:58.057 --> 03:49:00.460
AGENCIES WITH NO CONTACT WITH A

03:49:00.526 --> 03:49:02.562
ATTORNEYS LEGAL STAFF BUT MERELY

03:49:02.628 --> 03:49:04.430
FOR PROCESSING PURPOSES.

03:49:04.497 --> 03:49:05.798
WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE POLICIES

GUARANTEE THE INDEPENDENCE OF

03:49:09.302 --> 03:49:11.471
ALJ PANELS --

03:49:11.537 --> 03:49:12.605
BECAUSE THEY A THREE MEMBER

03:49:12.672 --> 03:49:14.373
PANEL ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

03:49:14.440 --> 03:49:15.641
MAKE THE DECISION THAT DECISION

03:49:15.708 --> 03:49:16.909
IS FINAL --

03:49:16.976 --> 03:49:18.878
THE DIRECTOR AND ANYONE ELSE

03:49:18.945 --> 03:49:19.445
DOES NOT SEE THAT UNTIL IT'S

03:49:19.512 --> 03:49:21.547
FINE -- AND

03:49:21.614 --> 03:49:22.882
WE'VE ESTABLISH INFORMATION

03:49:22.949 --> 03:49:25.318
SECURITY PROTOCOLS I WANTED TO

03:49:25.384 --> 03:49:26.819
WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I'D LIKE TO

03:49:26.886 --> 03:49:28.955
SUGGEST THAT DRESS.

03:49:29.021 --> 03:49:30.623
VERY SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE

03:49:30.690 --> 03:49:32.959
POINTS THAT CENTER GAINES RAISED --

03:49:33.025 --> 03:49:34.961
ON PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS OBVIO

03:49:35.027 --> 03:49:36.529
WE PRECEDENTS CONTINUE TO BE

03:49:36.596 --> 03:49:38.164
PRESIDENTIAL --

03:49:38.231 --> 03:49:39.799
AND LASTS A CASE COMES BEFORE

03:49:39.866 --> 03:49:41.567
OTA WHICH SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES

03:49:41.634 --> 03:49:42.502
THAT POINT.

03:49:42.568 --> 03:49:45.872
AND IT COULD BE OVERRULED IF THE

03:49:45.938 --> 03:49:47.840
PANEL AT OTA BELIEVES IT ISN'T

03:49:47.907 --> 03:49:49.509
NOT A MATTER OF LAW.

03:49:49.575 --> 03:49:51.477
OR IS SIMPLY INCORRECT --

03:49:51.544 --> 03:49:52.044
THAT'S PUT FORTH IN SECTION

03:49:52.111 --> 03:49:55.915
THREE OF FOR A FOR REGULATIONS --

03:49:55.982 --> 03:49:57.049
I ADDRESSED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

03:49:57.116 --> 03:49:58.618
THE SEPARATION OF THE DIRECTOR

03:49:58.684 --> 03:50:00.753
LEVEL FROM DECISION MAKING --

03:50:00.820 --> 03:50:01.621
THE SEPARATION FROM TAXING

03:50:01.687 --> 03:50:04.957
AUTHORITIES THE CASE BACKLOG THE

03:50:05.024 --> 03:50:06.159
TWELVE HUNDRED CASE BACKLOG

03:50:06.225 --> 03:50:08.261

REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THIS

03:50:09.829 --> 03:50:11.164
IS NOT A BACKLOG OR WAS NOT A

03:50:11.230 --> 03:50:12.465
BACKLOG PER SE OF IT RATHER

03:50:12.532 --> 03:50:13.432
CASES.

03:50:13.499 --> 03:50:14.901

03:50:14.967 --> 03:50:17.069
BE IT WE AND SENT TO OTA.

03:50:17.136 --> 03:50:18.004
ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG AT

03:50:18.070 --> 03:50:22.341
THIS POINT --

03:50:22.408 --> 03:50:24.944
I THINK THAT --

03:50:25.011 --> 03:50:26.312
THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE

03:50:26.379 --> 03:50:28.948
SPECIFIC ARE QUESTIONS CONCERNS

03:50:29.015 --> 03:50:30.283

OF OTA.

03:50:48.668 --> 03:50:50.403
WE CAN STILL MAKE THIS WE CAN

03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:52.238
MAKE THIS WORK FOR TAXPAYERS --

03:50:52.305 --> 03:50:55.975
WITH A MINIMUM OF OF VAN LARA

03:50:56.042 --> 03:50:58.311

03:54:02.528 --> 03:54:04.697
DRAFTED --

03:54:04.764 --> 03:54:06.232
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT [inaudible]

03:54:06.298 --> 03:54:09.668
THE QUESTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH

03:54:09.735 --> 03:54:11.303
PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS AND IF

LAW JUDGES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

03:54:16.909 --> 03:54:18.377
PARTICULAR OPERATION CAN'T

03:54:18.444 --> 03:54:20.379
REEVALUATE.

03:54:20.446 --> 03:54:22.114
CRIER DECISIONS ARE PRESIDENTIAL

03:54:22.181 --> 03:54:23.582
DECISIONS THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE

03:54:23.649 --> 03:54:25.418
WAY THE LAW WORKS.

03:54:25.484 --> 03:54:26.952
THAT IS DONE ALL THE TIME THE

03:54:27.019 --> 03:54:28.220
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

03:54:30.089 --> 03:54:31.624
PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS AND

03:54:31.690 --> 03:54:32.892
DECIDES TO GO IN A DIFFERENT

03:54:32.958 --> 03:54:33.626
DIRECTION FOR A VARIETY OF

03:54:33.692 --> 03:54:35.928
REASONS.

03:54:35.995 --> 03:54:37.329
BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:54:37.396 --> 03:54:38.631
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES

03:54:38.697 --> 03:54:40.132
ASSIGNED TO THE OFFICE TAX

EXPERIENCED IN THE AREA TAX.

03:54:46.605 --> 03:54:48.774
AND UNFORTUNATELY OR FORTUNATELY

03:54:48.841 --> 03:54:50.709
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT ATTORNEYS

03:54:50.776 --> 03:54:52.111
GAIN EXPERIENCE IS TO WORK FOR

03:54:52.178 --> 03:54:53.546
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHETHER YOU

03:54:53.612 --> 03:54:54.580
WORK FOR THE INTERESTING NEWS

03:54:54.647 --> 03:54:56.048
SERVICE FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX

03:54:56.115 --> 03:54:57.383
BOARD OR SOME OTHER.

03:54:57.450 --> 03:54:58.851
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SO TO SAY

03:54:58.918 --> 03:55:01.287
THAT IT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE.

03:55:01.353 --> 03:55:03.722
IS SOMEHOW BIASED OR PREJUDICED

03:55:03.789 --> 03:55:05.191
BECAUSE THEY GAINED EXPERIENCE

03:55:05.257 --> 03:55:07.460
IN ANOTHER AGENCY I THINK IS.

03:55:07.526 --> 03:55:09.028
CERTAINLY MISDIRECTED AND I'M

03:55:09.094 --> 03:55:10.262
CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THAT

03:55:10.329 --> 03:55:12.364
PARTICULAR AUDIT QUESTION.

03:55:12.431 --> 03:55:14.333
IT'S PHRASED WITH RESPECT TO

03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:15.501
CONFLICTS I'M NOT SURE HOW THE

03:55:15.568 --> 03:55:16.936
CONFLICT WOULD ARISE ARE WE

03:55:17.002 --> 03:55:18.204
SAYING THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:55:18.270 --> 03:55:19.939
LAW JUDGES DUAL EMPLOYED THAT

03:55:20.005 --> 03:55:21.540
THEY WORK AT THE SAME TIME FOR

03:55:21.607 --> 03:55:22.541
THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AS THEY

03:55:22.608 --> 03:55:24.143
DO.

03:55:24.210 --> 03:55:25.444
WORK FOR THE OFFICE OF TAX

03:55:25.511 --> 03:55:26.712
APPEALS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE

03:55:26.779 --> 03:55:28.147
AWAY THAT.

03:55:28.214 --> 03:55:29.515
I COULD SEE A CONFLICT AND

03:55:29.582 --> 03:55:31.150
BEYOND THAT I'M NOT CERTAIN

03:55:31.217 --> 03:55:32.785
ABOUT THAT BUT HAVING SAID ALL

03:55:32.852 --> 03:55:34.720
THAT I GUESS MY BASIC.

03:55:34.787 --> 03:55:37.256
CONCERN HERE IS OF THE TIMING OF

03:55:37.323 --> 03:55:38.724
THE ON IT.

03:55:38.791 --> 03:55:42.228
NO WE ALLOWED THE FORTY OF THE

03:55:42.294 --> 03:55:43.963
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

03:55:44.029 --> 03:55:45.564
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND MANY

03:55:45.631 --> 03:55:48.133
DECADES ESTABLISHING THE BOARDS

03:55:48.200 --> 03:55:50.302
PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES AND

03:55:50.369 --> 03:55:52.805
METHODS OF OPERATIONS --

03:55:52.872 --> 03:55:54.573
BEFORE WE TOOK.

03:55:54.640 --> 03:55:55.908
THE OPPORTUNITY OUR SELVES TO

03:55:55.975 --> 03:55:58.577
REVIEW THE BOARD'S AS SUCCESSES

03:55:58.644 --> 03:55:59.979
IN THE BOARD'S FAILURES AND

03:56:00.045 --> 03:56:01.480
ULTIMATELY.

03:56:01.547 --> 03:56:03.315
DECIDE THAT A REORGANIZATION WAS

03:56:03.382 --> 03:56:05.284
APPROPRIATE AND IN THIS CASE

03:56:05.351 --> 03:56:06.785
WHERE THESE --

03:56:06.852 --> 03:56:08.687
TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ONLY BEEN --

03:56:08.754 --> 03:56:10.422
IN EXISTENCE FOR TWELVE MONTHS

03:56:10.489 --> 03:56:11.924
OR IN THE CASE OF AN OPERATION

03:56:11.991 --> 03:56:12.825
IN THE CASE OF THE OFFICE OF TAX

03:56:12.892 --> 03:56:14.393
APPEALS.

03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:15.961
A SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THAT I

03:56:16.028 --> 03:56:17.029
THINK IT'S A BIT.

03:56:17.096 --> 03:56:19.265
PREMATURE O SEND THE STATE

03:56:19.331 --> 03:56:21.133
AUDITOR IN THERE TOO A TAKE A

03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:22.701
LOOK AT OPERATIONS AND SIMPLY

03:56:22.768 --> 03:56:24.203
TELL THE INDIVIDUALS RUNNING

03:56:24.270 --> 03:56:25.804
THESE ORGANIZATIONS.

03:56:25.871 --> 03:56:27.406
PROBABLY WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOWS

03:56:27.473 --> 03:56:29.942
THAT THEIR OF ORGANIZATIONAL

03:56:30.009 --> 03:56:31.710
EFFORTS ARE NOT COMPLETE.

03:56:31.777 --> 03:56:33.979
SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE --

03:56:34.046 --> 03:56:35.514
I'M SURE THAT BOTH THE OFFICE OF

03:56:35.581 --> 03:56:37.049
TAX APPEALS IN THE DEPARTMENT

03:56:37.116 --> 03:56:38.884
AND FEE ADMINISTRATION.

03:56:38.951 --> 03:56:39.685
HAVE --

03:56:39.752 --> 03:56:41.587
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIC PLANS A

03:56:41.654 --> 03:56:44.223
TIME LINE UP AT WHICH OR BY

03:56:44.290 --> 03:56:45.791
WHICH THEY INTEND TO BE FULLY

03:56:45.858 --> 03:56:48.093
OPERATIONAL IN FULLY ORGANIZED

03:56:48.160 --> 03:56:48.661
AND HOPEFULLY HAVE THE KINKS

03:56:48.727 --> 03:56:49.528
IRONED OUT.

03:56:49.595 --> 03:56:51.030
AND WHETHER IT'S TWO YEARS OR

03:56:51.096 --> 03:56:52.431
THREE YEARS I CERTAINLY THINK WE

03:56:52.498 --> 03:56:54.199
SHOULD ALLOW THE IMPLEMENTATION

03:56:54.266 --> 03:56:56.869
PLAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED FULLY --

03:56:56.936 --> 03:56:59.838
IN THE ORGANIZATION TO BE FULLY.

03:56:59.905 --> 03:57:02.174
BEFORE WE WE SEND THE STATE

03:57:02.241 --> 03:57:03.375
AUDITOR IN THERE I WOULD BE

03:57:03.442 --> 03:57:05.077
SUPPORTIVE OF AN AUDIT REQUEST I

03:57:05.144 --> 03:57:06.445
BELIEVE DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S

03:57:06.512 --> 03:57:08.514
PHRASED IN THE ISSUES THAT ARE

03:57:08.581 --> 03:57:09.915
GOING TO BE EXAMINED.

03:57:09.982 --> 03:57:11.684
AT THE END OF THAT STRATEGIC

03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:13.586
PLAN THAT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

03:57:13.652 --> 03:57:15.220
WHETHER IT'S TWO OR THREE YEARS.

03:57:15.287 --> 03:57:16.956
DECEPTIVE TO DO A CHECK TO SEE

03:57:17.022 --> 03:57:18.691
HOW THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS IS

03:57:18.757 --> 03:57:21.093
PROCESSING CASES TO SEE WHETHER

03:57:21.160 --> 03:57:22.895
THERE'S A BACKLOG TO SEE WHETHER.

03:57:22.962 --> 03:57:23.996
IT SIMMERS ARRABAL TO CONTACT

03:57:24.063 --> 03:57:25.965
THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE.

03:57:26.031 --> 03:57:27.399
THE OFFICE OF TAX AND FEE

03:57:27.466 --> 03:57:29.468
ADMINISTRATION SO I'M HAVING

SAID THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME --

03:57:32.705 --> 03:57:34.640
I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE

03:57:34.707 --> 03:57:35.174
AUDIT -- BUT

AUDIT THAT --

03:57:41.046 --> 03:57:41.947
AT THE END OF THAT

03:57:42.014 --> 03:57:43.549
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN I AM

03:57:43.616 --> 03:57:45.050

BEEN FOUND IN FAVOR OF THE HAD

03:58:18.851 --> 03:58:20.352
TAX AGENCY RATHER THAN THE

03:58:31.430 --> 03:58:33.732
STEVE SEVENTY I BELIEVE OUR

03:58:33.799 --> 03:58:35.868

03:58:35.934 --> 03:58:37.903
THAT ARE IN FAVOR THE TAXPAYER --

03:58:37.970 --> 03:58:40.372
THERE ARE MORE COMING LIKELY IN

03:58:40.439 --> 03:58:42.241
THE NEXT TRUNKS BECAUSE THAT

03:58:42.307 --> 03:58:44.843
CASES THAT WE STARTED OUT WITH --

03:58:44.910 --> 03:58:46.445
WERE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD BREAD

03:58:46.512 --> 03:58:48.013
AND BUTTER CASES THEY INVOLVE

03:58:48.080 --> 03:58:49.581
PENALTY CASES WHERE THERE'S NOT

03:58:49.648 --> 03:58:50.516
A LOT OF GRAY AREA IN THESE

03:58:50.582 --> 03:58:53.052
CASES OR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD CASES

03:58:53.118 --> 03:58:54.887
WHERE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE

03:58:54.953 --> 03:58:57.222
A DECISION THAT CATEGORICALLY

03:58:57.289 --> 03:58:59.124
YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEAD OF

03:58:59.191 --> 03:59:01.427
HOUSEHOLD OR YOU'RE NOT --

03:59:01.493 --> 03:59:02.494

THE DISCRETION SOME OF THESE

03:59:04.329 --> 03:59:05.864
CASES ARE QUITE --

03:59:05.931 --> 03:59:07.299
SYMPATHETIC WE DON'T BELIEVE WE

03:59:07.366 --> 03:59:09.168
HAVE THE DISCRETION TO ACT ON

03:59:09.234 --> 03:59:11.804
THAT WE ARE A LJ IS ACT AS A

03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:13.639

03:59:15.407 --> 03:59:16.875
I SUSPECT THAT --

03:59:16.942 --> 03:59:18.377
WELL I DON'T SUSPECT I KNOW THAT

03:59:18.444 --> 03:59:19.845
SOME OF THE CASES THEY'RE COMING

03:59:19.912 --> 03:59:21.547
DOWN THE LINE SOME OF THE MUCH

03:59:21.613 --> 03:59:22.347
MORE COMPLEX CASES WHERE THERE

03:59:22.414 --> 03:59:22.648
[inaudible]

03:59:22.715 --> 03:59:26.051
OF OF REASONABLE POINTS OF VIEW

03:59:26.118 --> 03:59:28.520
ON ON EITHER SIDE FOR EXAMPLE A

03:59:28.587 --> 03:59:30.856
TAX CREDITS ARE INDEED CREDITS

03:59:30.923 --> 03:59:32.491
THINGS LIKE THAT --

03:59:32.558 --> 03:59:34.026
WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE SOME

03:59:34.093 --> 03:59:35.994
DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND A SENSE

03:59:36.061 --> 03:59:38.464
AND SO FORTH I'D ALSO ADD THAT

03:59:38.530 --> 03:59:40.399
DURING THE PROCESS OF THE

03:59:40.466 --> 03:59:42.935
APPEALS WHEAT WE THE ALJ IS

03:59:43.001 --> 03:59:43.635
TOGETHER WHERE OUR STAFF

03:59:43.702 --> 03:59:44.703
ATTORNEYS HOLD PRE HEARING

03:59:44.770 --> 03:59:46.238
CONFERENCES.

03:59:46.305 --> 03:59:47.673
AND MANY OF THOSE CONFERENCES

03:59:47.740 --> 03:59:49.641
ISSUES COME TO LIGHT.

03:59:49.708 --> 03:59:51.777
BY EITHER THE TAX AGENCY OR THE

03:59:51.844 --> 03:59:53.746
TAXPAYER AND THE TAXATION SHE

03:59:53.812 --> 03:59:55.848
HAS WITHDRAWN --

03:59:55.914 --> 03:59:56.849
BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE

03:59:56.915 --> 03:59:59.284
THAT WAS SAID A SUITABLE.

03:59:59.351 --> 04:00:00.219
SO I'VE SEEN I APPRECIATE IT BUT

04:00:00.285 --> 04:00:02.087
AS WE'VE SEEN WE'VE BEEN HERE

04:00:02.154 --> 04:00:03.055
FOR LIKE LONGTIME WAS THAT WAS

04:00:03.122 --> 04:00:04.823
GO SO I JUST REALLY THAT WHAT'S

04:00:04.890 --> 04:00:07.726
THE RECORD OF TAX PAYERS APPEALS

04:00:07.793 --> 04:00:09.595
GRANTED VERSES [inaudible]

04:00:09.661 --> 04:00:11.663
NOT GRANTED.

04:00:11.730 --> 04:00:13.232
OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE SO FAR IS

04:00:13.298 --> 04:00:18.637
YOUR BEST ESTIMATE --

04:00:18.704 --> 04:00:19.972
YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD PREFER

04:00:20.038 --> 04:00:21.573
TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT

04:00:21.640 --> 04:00:23.509
QUESTION AND THE REASON.

04:00:23.575 --> 04:00:24.676
I AS WELL AS SPEAKS SO THAT'S

04:00:24.743 --> 04:00:26.612
FINE -- SO

04:00:26.678 --> 04:00:28.981
IS IT NOT.

04:00:29.047 --> 04:00:31.383
THAT THERE ARE NO TAX PAYER

04:00:31.450 --> 04:00:34.720
APPEALS THAT HAVE SUCCEEDED.

04:00:34.787 --> 04:00:35.854
IT IS TRUE THAT THERE AND

04:00:35.921 --> 04:00:37.322
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE POSTED

04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:39.291
RIGHT NOW THERE IS A DECISION

04:00:39.358 --> 04:00:40.659
THAT WENT IN FAVOR THE TAXPAYER

04:00:40.726 --> 04:00:42.394
WITH RESPECT TO A PETITION FOR

04:00:42.461 --> 04:00:43.862
REHEARING OF A CASE.

04:00:43.929 --> 04:00:44.696
THE OTHERS I BELIEVE ARE IN

04:00:44.763 --> 04:00:46.165
FAVOR OF THE TAX AGENTS.

04:00:46.231 --> 04:00:47.466
I THINK THERE [inaudible]

04:00:47.533 --> 04:00:49.368
THAT.

04:00:49.434 --> 04:00:51.203
THAT'S NORMAL ALL I'M GOOD GALA

04:00:51.270 --> 04:00:52.471
NEED IS A SNAPSHOT FOR ME TO

04:00:52.538 --> 04:00:54.173
DECIDE.

04:00:54.239 --> 04:00:55.374
AND AT THIS POINT A PROBABLY

04:00:55.440 --> 04:00:56.742
MAKING THE MOTION TO MOVE

04:00:56.809 --> 04:00:59.144
FORWARD BECAUSE THERE'S SOME --

04:00:59.211 --> 04:01:00.779
POSSIBILITY THAT THAT SHOULD BE

04:01:00.846 --> 04:01:03.182
INVESTIGATED BUT I DON'T I AGREE

04:01:03.248 --> 04:01:04.483
THAT YOU HAVE RATIONAL ARGUMENTS

04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:09.087
IT SOUND LIKE IT'S PROBABLY.

04:01:09.154 --> 04:01:10.956
GOING TO CHANGE THE RECORD IN

04:01:11.023 --> 04:01:12.591
THE FUTURE.

04:01:12.658 --> 04:01:14.092
GIVEN THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

04:01:14.159 --> 04:01:16.361
CASES THAT ARE COMING BUT IT'S

04:01:16.428 --> 04:01:16.929
JUST NOT HERE FOR US TO SEE

04:01:16.995 --> 04:01:18.096
TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible]

04:01:18.163 --> 04:01:19.965
THIS BAKER.

04:01:20.032 --> 04:01:21.366
THANK YOU THAT ALSO PEAKED MY

04:01:21.433 --> 04:01:22.467
INTEREST AS WELL AND I HEARD

04:01:22.534 --> 04:01:24.303
THAT BUT I I WANNA GO BACK TO

04:01:24.369 --> 04:01:25.771
YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT.

04:01:25.838 --> 04:01:28.207
BACKLOG IN THAT THERE ISN'T.

04:01:28.273 --> 04:01:30.642
ONE AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

04:01:30.709 --> 04:01:32.277
IS WHAT SOME CLARIFICATION YOU

04:01:32.344 --> 04:01:32.945
MENTION THAT THE CASES THAT CAME

04:01:33.011 --> 04:01:35.314
BACK CAME TO YOU WERE ONES THAT

04:01:35.380 --> 04:01:38.050
EXISTED BEFORE --

04:01:38.116 --> 04:01:39.985
IS IS THAT CORRECT THAT THAT IS

04:01:40.052 --> 04:01:42.020
CORRECT OKAY CHAU DO YOU.

04:01:42.087 --> 04:01:42.888
BUT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY

04:01:42.955 --> 04:01:45.424
CAME FROM DO YOU HAVE A BACKLOG.

04:01:45.490 --> 04:01:47.259
MAYBE THEY WERE THE ONES YOU'VE

04:01:47.326 --> 04:01:48.694
CAUSED OR HAPPENED WHERE YOUR

04:01:48.760 --> 04:01:49.862
EXISTENCE BUT IS THERE THERE'S A

04:01:49.928 --> 04:01:51.496
BACKLOG.

04:01:51.563 --> 04:01:53.365
THERE IS NOT A BACKLOG.

04:01:53.432 --> 04:01:54.733
A TWELVE HUNDRED CASES WHERE THE

04:01:54.800 --> 04:01:56.268
CASES THAT WE INHERITED FROM BE

04:01:56.335 --> 04:01:57.603
A WEEK IN THE TRANSITION THERE

04:01:57.669 --> 04:01:59.238
WERE CASES IN PROCESS.

04:01:59.304 --> 04:02:01.206
OTA TOOK THEM OVER.

04:02:01.273 --> 04:02:03.575
THERE WAS A BACKLOG OF A COUPLE

04:02:03.642 --> 04:02:05.544
OF SEVERAL.

04:02:05.611 --> 04:02:06.945
I I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS

04:02:07.012 --> 04:02:10.215
AND IT WAS A FEW --

04:02:10.282 --> 04:02:10.816
HUNDRED THREE FOUR HUNDRED OF

04:02:10.883 --> 04:02:12.050
CASES THAT NEEDED TO BE

04:02:12.117 --> 04:02:13.318
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AS THE

04:02:13.385 --> 04:02:15.721
TAXPAYER HAD FILED AN APPEAL AND

04:02:15.787 --> 04:02:17.089
IT HAD NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED YET

04:02:17.155 --> 04:02:19.224
I SUSPECT THAT IS BECAUSE OF

04:02:19.291 --> 04:02:21.059
SOME CONFUSION THE TRANSITION.

04:02:21.126 --> 04:02:21.526
ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN

04:02:21.593 --> 04:02:22.794
ACKNOWLEDGED.

04:02:22.861 --> 04:02:23.795
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE WAS

04:02:23.862 --> 04:02:25.697
A BACKLOG IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

04:02:25.764 --> 04:02:26.965
THAT INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE

04:02:27.032 --> 04:02:28.567
TAXPAYER.

04:02:28.634 --> 04:02:29.534
THOSE A BIDDING KNOWLEDGE AND

04:02:29.601 --> 04:02:31.103
THEY ARE IN OUR SYSTEM THEY ARE

04:02:31.169 --> 04:02:33.005
PART OF THAT. FIFTEEN HUNDRED

04:02:33.071 --> 04:02:34.840
CASE THAT I MENTION.

04:02:34.907 --> 04:02:36.875
NOW HAVING SAID THAT WE ARE

04:02:36.942 --> 04:02:39.278
ACTUALLY GETTING MORE APPEALS

04:02:39.344 --> 04:02:40.379
THEN -- BEER

04:02:40.445 --> 04:02:42.314
WE AT THIS POINT.

04:02:42.381 --> 04:02:44.616
SO -- WE ARE

04:02:44.683 --> 04:02:46.585
WE ARE KATA WE'RE CAUGHT UP BUT

04:02:46.652 --> 04:02:48.387
INITIALLY WE EXPECTED.

04:02:48.453 --> 04:02:51.123
APPEALS ON THE ORDER OF SAY A

04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.857
HUNDRED TWENTY A MONTH WE'RE

04:02:51.924 --> 04:02:54.526
GETTING MORE LIKE A HUNDRED

04:02:54.593 --> 04:02:55.360
THIRTY HUNDRED FORTY SO IT'S

04:02:55.427 --> 04:02:57.162
POSSIBLE WE NEED.

04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:59.164
TO REASSESS OUR RESOURCES TO

04:02:59.231 --> 04:03:00.666
MAKE SURE WE KEEP UP WITH THE

04:03:00.732 --> 04:03:02.301
WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS AND

04:03:02.367 --> 04:03:04.002
RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER.

04:03:04.069 --> 04:03:06.104
MAY MAYBE I'M --

04:03:06.171 --> 04:03:07.272
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR

04:03:07.339 --> 04:03:09.241
CONSIDERING THE BACKLOG IS IT

04:03:09.308 --> 04:03:10.008
THAT IN SEMI DIDN'T GET A

04:03:10.075 --> 04:03:11.576
RESPONSE.

04:03:11.643 --> 04:03:12.544
AND THAT YOU TOOK CARE OF THAT

04:03:12.611 --> 04:03:14.379
BECAUSE I GOT A RESPONSE OR IS

04:03:14.446 --> 04:03:15.714
IT JUST YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A CASE

04:03:15.781 --> 04:03:17.349
LOAD WASN'T MUCH COURSE EVER.

04:03:17.416 --> 04:03:19.651
EVER CASELOAD BUT THEN THERE

04:03:19.718 --> 04:03:21.353
SOME THAT OURS ARE OLD.

04:03:21.420 --> 04:03:22.955
AND I SO WHAT WOULD IT WOULD DO

04:03:23.021 --> 04:03:23.789
WELL YOU SAY WE HAVE NO BACKLOG

04:03:23.855 --> 04:03:25.223
WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A BACKLOG

04:03:25.290 --> 04:03:26.358
IF.

04:03:26.425 --> 04:03:27.759
WE GOT A HUNDRED TWENTY CASES

04:03:27.826 --> 04:03:29.594
AND IN A MONTH AND WE ONLY WORK

04:03:29.661 --> 04:03:30.796
THROUGH ONE HUNDRED OF THEM.

04:03:30.862 --> 04:03:32.397
WE GOT TWENTY CASES THAT ARE

04:03:32.464 --> 04:03:34.199
DELAYED AND IS THAT TWENTY EACH

04:03:34.266 --> 04:03:35.834
MONTH ACCUMULATES THAT BECOMES A

04:03:35.901 --> 04:03:37.903
BACKLOG THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE

04:03:37.970 --> 04:03:38.203
RIGHT NOW.

04:03:38.270 --> 04:03:41.239
OKAY AND HAVE YOU DO YOU KNOW

04:03:41.306 --> 04:03:43.275
HOW YOUR RATE OF DEALING WITH

04:03:43.342 --> 04:03:45.243
THOSE CASES IS COMPARED TO WHEN

04:03:45.310 --> 04:03:47.679
BE A WE WAS THE ENTITY.

04:03:47.746 --> 04:03:50.782
BECAUSE JUST BIT HOW YOU COMPARE

04:03:50.849 --> 04:03:52.150
FOR ME IF THERE IS A BACKLOG AND

04:03:52.217 --> 04:03:53.018
THEY'RE SOMETHING THAT ALREADY

04:03:53.085 --> 04:03:55.554
AT THIS EARLY STAGE IS A CONCERN.

04:03:55.620 --> 04:03:56.455
WE'RE WATCHING THAT VERY

04:03:56.521 --> 04:03:59.458
CAREFULLY YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SAM.

04:03:59.524 --> 04:04:01.226
WE HAVE A LIMITED.

04:04:01.293 --> 04:04:04.496
HISTORICAL RECORD AT THIS POINT --

04:04:04.563 --> 04:04:06.098
I I THINK GIVEN OUR CURRENT

04:04:06.164 --> 04:04:08.033
RESOURCES WE CAN KEEP ON WE CAN

04:04:08.100 --> 04:04:09.134
KEEP ON TRACK WE'RE IN GOOD

04:04:09.201 --> 04:04:10.869
SHAPE RIGHT NOW BUT WE NEED TO

04:04:10.936 --> 04:04:13.138
WATCH IT VERY CAREFULLY --

04:04:13.205 --> 04:04:14.406
IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THAT WAS

04:04:14.473 --> 04:04:15.407
CERTAINLY THE BILL WE HAVE A

04:04:15.474 --> 04:04:16.675
LONG HISTORY OF HOW LONG IT

04:04:16.742 --> 04:04:18.310
EXISTED AND SAID YOU HAVE A

04:04:18.377 --> 04:04:19.544
SENSE OF JUST WHAT.

04:04:19.611 --> 04:04:21.179
EVEN IN YOUR SHORT TIME PERIOD

04:04:21.246 --> 04:04:23.648
WITH THE CASES.

04:04:23.715 --> 04:04:25.183
BUT YOU HAVE THAT COMPARED TO

04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.817
WHAT BILLY WAS DOING DO YOU KNOW

04:04:25.884 --> 04:04:27.753
THAT THE THE LIKE THE TIME THE

04:04:27.819 --> 04:04:29.955
TEXT OF THE CASE TAKES TO GO

04:04:30.022 --> 04:04:31.189
THROUGH THE SYSTEM IS OR ARE HOW

04:04:31.256 --> 04:04:32.791
HOW QUICKLY SOME RATE OF SOME

04:04:32.858 --> 04:04:33.825
POINT OF COMPARISON BECAUSE THAT

04:04:33.892 --> 04:04:34.426
IS ONE OF THE POINTS THAT.

04:04:34.493 --> 04:04:35.927
WERE STRUCK OUT IN MY MIND IS

04:04:35.994 --> 04:04:38.497
VERY INTERESTING IS THAT IF WE

04:04:38.563 --> 04:04:40.298
ARE OF MADE THIS TRANSITION OVER.

04:04:40.365 --> 04:04:41.700
IT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF HOW IT

04:04:41.767 --> 04:04:43.368
ALL CAME TO BE BUT WHAT IF IF

04:04:43.435 --> 04:04:45.303
I'M.

04:04:45.370 --> 04:04:47.572
IF WE ARE NOW SEEN A POSSIBILITY

04:04:47.639 --> 04:04:48.540
THAT TAXPAYERS WILL NOT BE

04:04:48.607 --> 04:04:49.875
SERVED UP BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY

04:04:49.941 --> 04:04:51.843
LONG BACKLOG.

04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:52.778
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME HOW

04:04:52.844 --> 04:04:54.012
LONG IT IS JUST AS ARE PEOPLE

04:04:54.079 --> 04:04:55.213
DOING THEIR WORK AS DILIGENTLY

04:04:55.280 --> 04:04:57.015
AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND WE WILL

04:04:57.082 --> 04:04:59.151
YOUR EXISTENCE IS A LITTLE BIT

04:04:59.217 --> 04:04:59.818
SHORTER.

04:04:59.885 --> 04:05:01.420
THE DELAY WAS LONGER SO SHOULD

04:05:01.486 --> 04:05:05.690
HAVE SOME POINT OF REFERENCE --

04:05:05.757 --> 04:05:07.059
IF IF IF A TAXPAYER GOES THROUGH

04:05:07.125 --> 04:05:08.860
THE THROUGH THE REGULAR PROCESS

04:05:08.927 --> 04:05:10.429
OF THE APPEAL PROCESS THAT IS IT

04:05:10.495 --> 04:05:11.963
DOESN'T THERE'S NO EXCEPTIONS IT

04:05:12.030 --> 04:05:13.398
WASN'T TAKEN OUT FOR SETTLEMENT

04:05:13.465 --> 04:05:15.567
THEN CAME BACK AND IT'S ABOUT

04:05:15.634 --> 04:05:16.134
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS WE

04:05:16.201 --> 04:05:17.602
EXPECT THE PROCESS.

04:05:17.669 --> 04:05:19.371
ONCE WE ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED

04:05:19.438 --> 04:05:20.972
WITHOUT TO BE SHORTER THAN IT

04:05:21.039 --> 04:05:22.441
TAKES ON OF THE BE AWAY AND I

04:05:22.507 --> 04:05:23.742
WOULD I WOULD ADD.

04:05:23.809 --> 04:05:25.744

JUSTIFIED TO MOVE FORWARD --

04:08:56.187 --> 04:08:58.623
WITHIN AUDIT THAT --

04:08:58.690 --> 04:09:01.426
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT --

04:09:01.493 --> 04:09:03.128
JUST I I'VE GOT CONCERNED AS TO

04:09:03.194 --> 04:09:04.162
WHETHER.

ARE TRULY INDEPENDENT.

04:09:08.500 --> 04:09:09.701
AND THEN WHY THE PRIORITY FOR

04:09:09.768 --> 04:09:11.670
INCOME TAX.

04:09:11.736 --> 04:09:13.738
VERSES INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE A

THAT -- FOR

WHICH PENALTIES ARE CONTINUING

04:09:21.546 --> 04:09:22.580
ON A DAILY BASIS --

04:09:22.647 --> 04:09:24.616
INCREASING.

04:09:24.683 --> 04:09:25.884
AND THEN FINALLY AND SOME OF

04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:26.718
THESE CASES YOU'VE HAD THE OUR

04:09:26.785 --> 04:09:29.254
* -- GO

04:09:29.321 --> 04:09:32.424
AHEAD AND GRANT --

04:09:32.490 --> 04:09:34.326
FLEXIBILITY I WAS READING --

04:09:34.392 --> 04:09:35.360
ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR WHERE

04:09:35.427 --> 04:09:36.494
THERE IS ADAPT THE DEATH OF A

04:09:36.561 --> 04:09:38.129
FAMILY MEMBER.

04:09:38.196 --> 04:09:39.998
AND THE IRS GRANTED ADDITIONAL

04:09:40.065 --> 04:09:42.300
TIME FOR THE DOCUMENTATION AND

04:09:42.367 --> 04:09:43.968
THE PAYMENT TO BE MADE.

04:09:44.035 --> 04:09:48.139
AND THAT WAS DENIED BY THE DOD.

04:09:48.206 --> 04:09:49.841
SO -- I'M

04:09:49.908 --> 04:09:51.376
SHE'S MAY NOT BY THE DOD THE OTA

04:09:51.443 --> 04:09:53.011
SO MY HOPE WOULD BE.

04:09:53.078 --> 04:09:53.845
THAT.

04:09:53.912 --> 04:09:57.449
THERE WOULD BE --

04:09:57.515 --> 04:10:00.151
SOME GRACE ON THE PART OF OCHIAI.

04:10:00.218 --> 04:10:01.286
HAD THESE --

04:10:01.353 --> 04:10:02.821
AS THESE CASES MOVE FORWARD

04:10:02.887 --> 04:10:03.988
WE'RE DEALING WITH SMALL

04:10:04.055 --> 04:10:05.724
BUSINESS OWNERS.

04:10:05.790 --> 04:10:08.193
BUT OFTEN ARE NOT SOPHISTICATED.

04:10:08.259 --> 04:10:11.663
AND NOT FAMILIAR WITH --

04:10:11.730 --> 04:10:12.597
THE LAW.

04:10:12.664 --> 04:10:13.832
AND THEY'RE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN

04:10:13.898 --> 04:10:16.101
THINGS AND IN SOME CASES ASIA

04:10:16.167 --> 04:10:20.572
SHUTTING BUSINESS AND THE BEER

04:10:20.638 --> 04:10:22.607
WE HAD THAT ABILITY --

04:10:22.674 --> 04:10:25.276

04:10:26.578 --> 04:10:26.811
[inaudible]

04:10:26.878 --> 04:10:29.514
AND SO --

04:10:29.581 --> 04:10:30.115
MAYBE THAT WOULD CHANGE IN THE

04:10:30.181 --> 04:10:35.620
FUTURE.

04:10:35.687 --> 04:10:36.688

HERE -- THAT

04:10:41.493 --> 04:10:42.794
WE OUGHT TO MOVE FORWARD AND

THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO THE CITY

04:26:13.324 --> 04:26:14.892

IMMEDIATELY BUT CERTAINLY WE'RE

04:26:29.707 --> 04:26:31.675

THEY HAVE THE STEP THEY HAVE

04:27:00.304 --> 04:27:01.805
TAKEN THAT'S APPROPRIATE IS THEY

04:27:01.872 --> 04:27:04.641
HAVE ESTABLISHED LOANS NOW WHERE

SOME OTHER INTERIM POSITIONS --

04:27:48.419 --> 04:27:50.053
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IN

04:27:50.120 --> 04:27:51.889
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR --

04:27:51.955 --> 04:27:53.190

04:28:16.647 --> 04:28:18.415
ITEMS THE CITY GAVE TO US ON MY

04:28:23.454 --> 04:28:24.655
LOOKING AT IT SAID.

04:28:24.721 --> 04:28:26.323
IT'S NOT REALLY A PLAN OR A PATH

04:28:26.390 --> 04:28:28.725
IT IS IDEAS OF SUGGESTIONS FOR

04:28:28.792 --> 04:28:29.993

04:30:34.551 --> 04:30:36.520
DIFFERENT TARGET AREAS OVER SIX

04:30:36.587 --> 04:30:38.021
HUNDRED PAGES OF DOCUMENTS AND

04:30:38.088 --> 04:30:39.022
AS BEST WE CAN TELL I BELIEVE

04:30:39.089 --> 04:30:40.324
THAT THE THE AUDITOR'S ACTUALLY.

04:30:40.390 --> 04:30:43.026
TRYING TO DO THE BEST HOPE IN

04:30:43.093 --> 04:30:44.361
JUST BELIEVE THAT THE PERHAPS

04:30:44.428 --> 04:30:45.862
COULD BE MORE TIME SPENT.

04:30:45.929 --> 04:30:47.064
IN A DIALOGUE WITH THE CITY TO

04:30:47.130 --> 04:30:49.766
DETERMINE DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY

04:30:49.833 --> 04:30:51.702
WERE SUBMITTED WERE NOT EITHER

04:30:51.768 --> 04:30:53.637
UP TO SNUFF MORE WERE LACKING IN

04:30:53.704 --> 04:30:55.138
CLARITY FOR ADDITIONAL

04:30:55.205 --> 04:30:56.640
INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL.

04:30:56.707 --> 04:30:58.108
OF THE CITY HAS DONE A GREAT JOB

04:30:58.175 --> 04:30:59.209
THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS OF

04:30:59.276 --> 04:31:00.944
REALLY DOING A HUGE TURNAROUND

04:31:01.011 --> 04:31:02.145
THEY'VE ADOPTED THEIR FIRST

04:31:02.212 --> 04:31:05.749
BALLOTS BUDGET BY UNANIMOUS A

04:31:05.816 --> 04:31:06.917
THREE HE HAD HIS RESOLUTION.

04:31:06.984 --> 04:31:08.318
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THEY'VE

04:31:08.385 --> 04:31:09.720
OVERHAULED THEIR MASTER FEE

04:31:09.786 --> 04:31:11.555
SCHEDULE THEY'VE NOW MOVE FOR

04:31:11.622 --> 04:31:12.923
WITH TO EIGHTEEN COMPLIANCE FOR

04:31:12.990 --> 04:31:14.591
WATER AND SEWER THEY PUT IN

04:31:14.658 --> 04:31:16.326
PLACE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

04:31:16.393 --> 04:31:17.694
THAT WOULD PREVENT.

04:31:17.761 --> 04:31:18.695
THE ERRORS OF THE PAST WHICH

04:31:18.762 --> 04:31:20.063
FRANKLY WERE BAD ACCOUNTING

04:31:20.130 --> 04:31:21.865
PROCEDURES THEY WERE UTILIZING

04:31:21.932 --> 04:31:22.966
OR ACCESSING SOME OF THEIR

04:31:23.033 --> 04:31:24.668
ENTERPRISE FUNDS AND MOVING THEM

04:31:24.735 --> 04:31:26.903
INTO GENERAL FUND THOSE HAVE ALL

04:31:26.970 --> 04:31:27.571
BEEN RECTIFIED.

04:31:27.638 --> 04:31:28.939
OUR TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING VERY

04:31:29.006 --> 04:31:29.873
CLOSE WIH THEM TO COME UP THE

04:31:29.940 --> 04:31:31.742
BEST PRACTICES AND THEN COURSE

04:31:31.808 --> 04:31:33.076
IMPLEMENTING THOSE PRACTICES

04:31:33.143 --> 04:31:34.878
THROUGH A POLICY ADOPTION AT THE

04:31:34.945 --> 04:31:35.912
COUNCIL LEVEL.

04:31:35.979 --> 04:31:37.114
WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S IN THE BEST

04:31:37.180 --> 04:31:38.615
INTERESTS OF THE CITY AND THE

04:31:38.682 --> 04:31:40.250
TAXPAYERS TO MOVE FOR WITH A

04:31:40.317 --> 04:31:42.119
MONITORING PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO

04:31:42.185 --> 04:31:43.186
A FULL AUDIT.

04:31:43.253 --> 04:31:44.688
VERY SIMILAR TO THE OTHER

04:31:44.755 --> 04:31:45.989
AGENCIES THAT THE AUDITOR HAS

04:31:46.056 --> 04:31:48.025
REVIEWED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN

04:31:48.091 --> 04:31:49.459
THERE BEEN THIRTEEN CITIES THAT

04:31:49.526 --> 04:31:50.427
HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR HIGH RISK

04:31:50.494 --> 04:31:52.162
AUDIT. NINE IF OF HAVE MOVED

04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:53.530
OVER TO THE MONITORING PORTION

04:31:53.597 --> 04:31:55.565
THE PROGRAM WITH FOR MOVING TO A

04:31:55.632 --> 04:31:56.667
FULL ON IT.

04:31:56.733 --> 04:31:58.769
AT THIS POINT THE CITY HAS A

04:31:58.835 --> 04:32:01.271
GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN

04:32:01.338 --> 04:32:02.339
SOME MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC

04:32:02.406 --> 04:32:04.508
DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO TO ATTRACT

04:32:04.574 --> 04:32:06.209
SOME NEW EMPLOYEES TO FILL SOME

04:32:06.276 --> 04:32:07.811
OF THE VACANCIES THAT THE

04:32:07.878 --> 04:32:08.679
AUDITOR HAS IDENTIFIED.

04:32:08.745 --> 04:32:10.213
WE BELIEVE THAT AN AUDIT AT THIS

04:32:10.280 --> 04:32:12.182
TIME COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE

04:32:12.249 --> 04:32:13.850
CITY'S ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT ITS

04:32:13.917 --> 04:32:15.252
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

04:32:15.318 --> 04:32:16.920
AND ALSO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND

04:32:16.987 --> 04:32:18.622
RETAIN QUALITY EMPLOYEES.

04:32:18.689 --> 04:32:20.557
SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A PASS

04:32:20.624 --> 04:32:21.425
HERE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT'S VERY

04:32:21.491 --> 04:32:23.260
CLEAR WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT

04:32:23.326 --> 04:32:24.628
WE WOULD VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD

04:32:24.695 --> 04:32:26.296
TO WORKING WITH THE AUDITOR IN A

04:32:26.363 --> 04:32:28.298
MORE OF A COLLABORATIVE MANNER

04:32:28.365 --> 04:32:29.900
AS OPPOSED TO THE AUDIT.

04:32:29.966 --> 04:32:31.668
AND WORK WITH HER AND HER STAFF

04:32:31.735 --> 04:32:33.236
TO IDENTIFY THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE

04:32:33.303 --> 04:32:34.438
THOSE PROCEDURES WHERE WE COULD

04:32:34.504 --> 04:32:35.839
YOU HAVE IMPROVEMENT OR

04:32:35.906 --> 04:32:36.640
ENHANCEMENT.

04:32:36.707 --> 04:32:38.175
IN ORDER --

04:32:38.241 --> 04:32:40.377
TO SATISFY THE CONCERNS OF THE

04:32:40.444 --> 04:32:42.245
SIX TOPIC AREAS AS AN EXAMPLE

04:32:42.312 --> 04:32:42.979
ONE OF THEM WAS POLICE A

04:32:43.046 --> 04:32:45.215
SERVICES OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT.

04:32:45.282 --> 04:32:46.283
THE CITY ACTUALLY IS HAD A

04:32:46.349 --> 04:32:48.251
REDUCTION IN VIOLENT CRIME AND

04:32:48.318 --> 04:32:50.687
IN OVERALL CRIME 20% REDUCTION

04:32:50.754 --> 04:32:52.289
SINCE.

04:32:52.355 --> 04:32:52.889
TWENTY FOURTEEN ALL OF THE FEE

04:32:52.956 --> 04:32:55.225
STUDIES FROM PLANNING BUILDING

04:32:55.292 --> 04:32:55.759
UP.

04:32:55.826 --> 04:32:58.428
RECREATION EVEN USER FEES

04:32:58.495 --> 04:33:00.464
REVIEWED THEY'VE ALSO MOVE

04:33:00.530 --> 04:33:02.132
FORWARD TO ADOPT THE UP

04:33:02.199 --> 04:33:03.266
PREFERRED OR IT'S IT'S A

04:33:03.333 --> 04:33:05.202
SUGGESTED A LIGHTING LANDSCAPE

04:33:05.268 --> 04:33:06.770
DISTRICT FEES ALL THESE OTHER

04:33:06.837 --> 04:33:08.572
THINGS THAT FRANKLY LIKE MANY

04:33:08.638 --> 04:33:10.107
JURISDICTIONS THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

04:33:10.173 --> 04:33:11.508
PERHAPS ELECTED OFFICIALS PUT

04:33:11.575 --> 04:33:13.243
THEM OFF FOR A LITTLE TOO LONG

04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:14.845
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO A

04:33:14.911 --> 04:33:17.114
BECAUSE THEIR CONSTITUENTS PAIN

04:33:17.180 --> 04:33:18.215
AND I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE

04:33:18.281 --> 04:33:19.349
THAT AT SOME POINT.

04:33:19.416 --> 04:33:20.917
EVERY JURISDICTION IN ESPECIALLY

04:33:20.984 --> 04:33:22.185
THOSE IN FISCAL --

04:33:22.252 --> 04:33:24.654
CHALLENGED TIMES NEED TO HAVE A

04:33:24.721 --> 04:33:26.123
PLAN IN PLACE WHERE THEY

04:33:26.189 --> 04:33:27.157
ACTUALLY HAVE THE DEFENSE WILL

04:33:27.224 --> 04:33:28.525
COST RECOVERY FOR THE DELIVERY

04:33:28.592 --> 04:33:30.127
OF THOSE SERVICES WHETHER THEY

04:33:30.193 --> 04:33:32.329
ARE FOR UTILITY SERVICES OR FOR

04:33:32.395 --> 04:33:33.430
THOSE TYPE OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN

04:33:33.497 --> 04:33:34.531
AT THE CITY LEVEL.

04:33:34.598 --> 04:33:35.799
I'M IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL

04:33:35.866 --> 04:33:37.134
APPROACH I BELIEVE THAT WORKING

04:33:37.200 --> 04:33:38.869
CLOSELY WITH RGS OUR TEAM AND

04:33:38.935 --> 04:33:40.737
WITH THE FOLKS ON ON ON THE

04:33:40.804 --> 04:33:42.973
CITY'S A STAFF AT THIS TIME WE

04:33:43.039 --> 04:33:44.474
WOULD BE ABLE TO COME BACK WITH

04:33:44.541 --> 04:33:45.776
A NO SIX TO NINE MONTHS WORKING

04:33:45.842 --> 04:33:46.643
WITH THE AUDITOR.

04:33:46.710 --> 04:33:49.246
AND PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH A

04:33:49.312 --> 04:33:51.448
MORE UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT

04:33:51.515 --> 04:33:52.949
HOW WERE FARING WHAT WE'RE DOING

04:33:53.016 --> 04:33:55.652
IT AGAIN BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO

04:33:55.719 --> 04:33:56.253
THOSE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

04:33:56.319 --> 04:33:56.620
RAISED.

04:33:56.686 --> 04:33:59.055
ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

04:33:59.122 --> 04:34:00.223
SEVER CANNELLA I KNOW THAT YOU

04:34:00.290 --> 04:34:01.691
HAVE --

04:34:01.758 --> 04:34:02.893
REPRESENTED --

04:34:02.959 --> 04:34:05.095
THE THE CITY THAT WATER --

04:34:05.162 --> 04:34:07.464
WELL IN IN IN AND WE HAD SOME

04:34:07.531 --> 04:34:09.299
CONVERSATIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO

04:34:09.366 --> 04:34:10.667
SURE SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:34:10.734 --> 04:34:12.369
UP FIRST OF I WANT TO SAY THAT

04:34:12.435 --> 04:34:14.070
YOU KNOW THE IMPACT ON THE

04:34:14.137 --> 04:34:15.539
COUNCIL OR THE CITY I DON'T

04:34:15.605 --> 04:34:16.540
REALLY CARE ABOUT QUITE FRANKLY

04:34:16.606 --> 04:34:17.874
AT MY COMMITMENTS TO THE

04:34:17.941 --> 04:34:19.209
RESIDENTS ABOUT WATER AND

04:34:19.276 --> 04:34:20.143
WHATEVER THE CITYHAS TO DO TO

04:34:20.210 --> 04:34:22.879
MEET THOSE COMMITMENTS ME.

04:34:22.946 --> 04:34:24.147
COULD DURING THE LAST MINUTE I

04:34:24.214 --> 04:34:25.515
ASK THAT WE HOLD ON THIS AUDIT

04:34:25.582 --> 04:34:27.684
BECAUSE I FELT THAT WATER WAS

04:34:27.751 --> 04:34:28.718
TRYING TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT

04:34:28.785 --> 04:34:30.053
DIRECTION AND I BELIEVE THAT

04:34:30.120 --> 04:34:30.654
THEY THEY ARE MOVING THE RIGHT

04:34:30.720 --> 04:34:31.922
DIRECTION.

04:34:31.988 --> 04:34:33.023
THEY CALLED ME A FEW WEEKS AGO

04:34:33.089 --> 04:34:34.090
AND SAID LOOK WE'D LIKE YOUR

04:34:34.157 --> 04:34:35.258
OFFICIAL OPPOSITION OF THE SAGA

04:34:35.325 --> 04:34:37.027
SO WE NEED TO COME IN TO EXPLAIN

04:34:37.093 --> 04:34:38.562
TO ME WHY I SHOULD OPPOSE IT.

04:34:38.628 --> 04:34:39.663
AND IF YOU HAVE A GOOD ARGUMENT

04:34:39.729 --> 04:34:40.764
BUT I WILL IF YOU DON'T THAT

04:34:40.831 --> 04:34:42.833
UNDERSCORED OUT JUST LIKE I TOLD

04:34:42.899 --> 04:34:43.433
MY COLLEAGUES THAT WOULD DO A

04:34:43.500 --> 04:34:44.568
FEW MONTHS AGO.

04:34:44.634 --> 04:34:45.502
NOW WE WENT THROUGH ALL THE

04:34:45.569 --> 04:34:46.436
VARIOUS THINGS THAT THEY'RE

04:34:46.503 --> 04:34:47.003
DOING IT AND I DON'T THINK

04:34:47.070 --> 04:34:48.338
THEY'RE THERE YET QUITE FRANKLY

04:34:48.405 --> 04:34:49.306
BUT I THINK THEY ARE MAKING

04:34:49.372 --> 04:34:51.341
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.

04:34:51.408 --> 04:34:53.276
WHO ARE OWN AUDITOR SAID THAT?

04:34:53.343 --> 04:34:54.411
OF THE FOURTEEN REQUESTS MADE

04:34:54.477 --> 04:34:55.979
WERE DOWN THE THIRTEEN NOW WE'LL

04:34:56.046 --> 04:34:57.247
SEE HOW MISTER GAINES TURNS OUT.

04:34:57.314 --> 04:34:58.782
THAT SHE COULD GET TWELVE OF

04:34:58.849 --> 04:35:00.283
THEM DONE BY NEXT FEBRUARY THAT

04:35:00.350 --> 04:35:01.785
BILLY J. LACK RECONVENES NEXT

04:35:01.852 --> 04:35:03.119
FEBRUARY.

04:35:03.186 --> 04:35:04.387
SO I WOULD ASK THAT

04:35:04.454 --> 04:35:05.989
UNDERSTANDING THAT OTHER CITIES

04:35:06.056 --> 04:35:07.224
THAT WERE LOOKED AT FOR A HIGH

04:35:07.290 --> 04:35:09.626
RISK OF BUTTON BEEN PUT INTO.

04:35:09.693 --> 04:35:11.962
THE MONITORING PROGRAM I THINK

04:35:12.028 --> 04:35:13.997
THERE WERE NINE OF THEM OF THE

04:35:14.064 --> 04:35:16.099
FOURTEEN I THINK OUT WATER --

04:35:16.166 --> 04:35:17.367
IS ELIGIBLE FOR THAT AS WELL

04:35:17.434 --> 04:35:18.401
JUST BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK I

04:35:18.468 --> 04:35:20.036
DON'T THINK THERE'S IMPENDING

04:35:20.103 --> 04:35:21.471
DISASTER WITHOUT WATER I THINK

04:35:21.538 --> 04:35:22.873
THEY ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT

04:35:22.939 --> 04:35:23.673
PROGRESS.

04:35:23.740 --> 04:35:25.342
AND OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T DIRECT

04:35:25.408 --> 04:35:26.443
THE AUDITOR TO PUT THEM ON A

04:35:26.509 --> 04:35:28.245
LARGER PROGRAM BUT I WOULD ASK

04:35:28.311 --> 04:35:29.613
THAT WE DO THAT IF THIS AUDIT

04:35:29.679 --> 04:35:31.114
DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD TODAY.

04:35:31.181 --> 04:35:31.648
BECAUSE AGAIN MY BEST MY

04:35:31.715 --> 04:35:34.551
INTEREST.

04:35:34.618 --> 04:35:35.585
BEST INTEREST OF OF THE

04:35:35.652 --> 04:35:37.320
RESIDENTS ABOUT WATER SO I THINK

04:35:37.387 --> 04:35:38.455
THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR THIS I

04:35:38.521 --> 04:35:39.756
THINK THEY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT

04:35:39.823 --> 04:35:40.690
PROGRESS.

04:35:40.757 --> 04:35:42.425
AND THEN AND THERE STRUGGLING OF

04:35:42.492 --> 04:35:43.660
COURSE JUST LIKE ALL UP AND DOWN

04:35:43.727 --> 04:35:44.861
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE A LOT

04:35:44.928 --> 04:35:45.996
OF STRUGGLES THAT OTHER PARTS OF

04:35:46.062 --> 04:35:47.364
THE STATE DO NOT HAVE.

04:35:47.430 --> 04:35:48.665
BUT WE PUT THEM IN A HIGH RISK

04:35:48.732 --> 04:35:50.100
AUDIT.

04:35:50.166 --> 04:35:51.835
ROOM THEN IF THEY HAVE TO GO OUT

04:35:51.902 --> 04:35:53.703
TO BOND FOR VARIOUS IMPROVEMENTS

04:35:53.770 --> 04:35:55.205
SOFT PAIR A HIGHER INTEREST RATE.

04:35:55.272 --> 04:35:57.107
THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT A

04:35:57.173 --> 04:35:58.808
QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

04:35:58.875 --> 04:36:00.710
I KNOW THAT IF I WERE APPLYING

04:36:00.777 --> 04:36:01.645
FOR A JOB I WOULD LOOK AT A CITY

04:36:01.711 --> 04:36:02.879
IF THEY WERE HIGH RISK I WOULD

04:36:02.946 --> 04:36:04.447
HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT IT SO.

MATERIALS FROM THE CITY ARE APT

04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:41.678
AT PRIOR TO THE LAST HEARING

04:37:41.745 --> 04:37:42.712
WHEN IT WAS HER IT WAS HEARD IN

04:37:42.779 --> 04:37:43.246
MAY.

04:37:43.313 --> 04:37:44.814
WE HAD SUBMIT A REQUEST EARLIER

04:37:44.881 --> 04:37:45.949
IN THE YEAR --

04:37:46.016 --> 04:37:46.916
BUT WAS PUT OFF UNTIL THE MAY

04:37:46.983 --> 04:37:49.419
HEARING SO AT THE MAY HEARING

04:37:49.486 --> 04:37:50.954
WHEN THE CITY APPEARED THEY HAD

04:37:51.021 --> 04:37:52.122
SENT US SOME MATERIALS ABOUT A

04:37:52.188 --> 04:37:53.356
WEEK BEFORE THE HEARING AND I

04:37:53.423 --> 04:37:54.290
TOLD STAFF.

04:37:54.357 --> 04:37:55.425
WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

04:37:55.492 --> 04:37:56.860
INFORMATION MY STAFF DID GO

04:37:56.926 --> 04:37:58.628
THROUGH THE MATERIALS.

04:37:58.695 --> 04:38:00.397
IT WASN'T AS VOLUMINOUS AT BASED

04:38:00.463 --> 04:38:02.399
ON WHAT THEY TOLD ME AS AS WHAT

04:38:02.465 --> 04:38:03.466
WAS REPRESENTED A FEW MINUTES

04:38:03.533 --> 04:38:05.301
AGO BUT THEY WENT THROUGH ALL OF

04:38:05.368 --> 04:38:07.103
THOSE MATERIALS AND I TOLD THEM

04:38:07.170 --> 04:38:08.805
I'D YOU NEED TO ADVISE ME.

04:38:08.872 --> 04:38:09.773
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO GO

04:38:09.839 --> 04:38:11.408
FORWARD WITH THIS REQUEST OR

04:38:11.474 --> 04:38:12.008
WHETHER WE DECIDE TO PULL IT

04:38:12.075 --> 04:38:13.243
MONITOR.

04:38:13.309 --> 04:38:15.345
BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT STAFF

04:38:15.412 --> 04:38:15.845
DID.

04:38:15.912 --> 04:38:17.113
AND AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

04:38:17.180 --> 04:38:19.416
THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME STEPS.

04:38:19.482 --> 04:38:21.017
BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THEIR

04:38:21.084 --> 04:38:22.719
BABY STEPS AND QUITE FRANKLY I

04:38:22.786 --> 04:38:23.720
THINK SOME OF THOSE STEPS ARE

04:38:23.787 --> 04:38:25.121
HAVE BEEN TAKEN BECAUSE WE HAVE

04:38:25.188 --> 04:38:26.489
BEEN LOOKING AT THE CITY OF

04:38:26.556 --> 04:38:27.123
ATWATER WE WENT OUT THERE AND

04:38:27.190 --> 04:38:28.158
CONDUCTED.

04:38:28.224 --> 04:38:29.793
AN ASSESSMENT BEFORE WHICH IS

04:38:29.859 --> 04:38:31.094
PART OF THE PROCESS BEFORE WE

04:38:31.161 --> 04:38:32.595
EVEN COME TO THE COMMITTEE.

04:38:32.662 --> 04:38:34.564
WE ABSOLUTELY CAN CONTINUE TO

04:38:34.631 --> 04:38:35.665
MONITOR THEM.

04:38:35.732 --> 04:38:37.000
BOMB IF THE AUDIT IS NOT

04:38:37.067 --> 04:38:38.701
APPROVED WE WILL DEFINITELY DO

04:38:38.768 --> 04:38:40.303
THAT AS WE MONITOR A LOT OF

04:38:40.370 --> 04:38:42.205
DIFFERENT CITIES WERE CONSTANTLY

04:38:42.272 --> 04:38:44.441
LOOKING AT NON FINANCIAL

04:38:44.507 --> 04:38:45.075
STATEMENTS THAT ARE COMING OUT

04:38:45.141 --> 04:38:46.509
WERE ACTUALLY DEVELOPING A

04:38:46.576 --> 04:38:47.510
PROGRAM THAT --

04:38:47.577 --> 04:38:49.179
HOPEFULLY WILL BE COME EVEN MORE

04:38:49.245 --> 04:38:51.047
AND MORE ROBUST.

04:38:51.114 --> 04:38:53.249
AS FAR AS MONITORING MY CONCERN

04:38:53.316 --> 04:38:55.919
AND OUR CONCERN IS WE'VE.

04:38:55.985 --> 04:38:58.154
LOOKED AT A INFORMATION BY

04:38:58.221 --> 04:38:58.621
CONDUCTING THE INITIAL

04:38:58.688 --> 04:38:59.823
ASSESSMENT.

04:38:59.889 --> 04:39:02.125
CAME TO J. LACK IN JANUARY WAS

04:39:02.192 --> 04:39:03.893
PUT OFF TILL MAY AS MR MATTEUCCI

04:39:03.960 --> 04:39:05.795
INDICATED AT THE MAY HEARING

04:39:05.862 --> 04:39:06.863
AGAIN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

04:39:06.930 --> 04:39:07.564
SENATOR.

04:39:07.630 --> 04:39:08.798
WE TOOK THE INFORMATION THAT THE

04:39:08.865 --> 04:39:10.433
CITY GAVE TO US AND WE'RE STILL

04:39:10.500 --> 04:39:11.935
NOT CONVINCED.

04:39:12.001 --> 04:39:13.036
ACOSTA WE THINK IT WOULD BE

04:39:13.103 --> 04:39:15.438
BENEFICIAL OFF FOR US TO GET OUT

04:39:15.505 --> 04:39:16.473
THERE AND TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF

04:39:16.539 --> 04:39:18.508
THE THE THINGS THAT THEY INTEND

04:39:18.575 --> 04:39:19.542
TO PUT INTO PLACE.

04:39:19.609 --> 04:39:21.478
THE OTHER ISSUE IS.

04:39:21.544 --> 04:39:23.613
THIS APPROVING AN AUDIT REQUEST

04:39:23.680 --> 04:39:25.415
DOES NOT MAKE THE CITY OF

04:39:25.482 --> 04:39:27.217
ATWATER A HIGH RISK CITY.

04:39:27.283 --> 04:39:29.285
CONDUCTING AN AUDIT WILL WILL

04:39:29.352 --> 04:39:30.353
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE

04:39:30.420 --> 04:39:32.455
DECIDE TO PUT THEM OUT THERE AS

04:39:32.522 --> 04:39:33.857
A HIGH RISK CITY.

04:39:33.923 --> 04:39:35.325
THE OTHER --

04:39:35.391 --> 04:39:37.794
RESULT OF THE AUDIT COULD BE.

04:39:37.861 --> 04:39:38.995
THE CITY HAS PUT CERTAIN

04:39:39.062 --> 04:39:41.030
POLICIES IN PLACE WE THINK

04:39:41.097 --> 04:39:42.699
THEY'RE LONG STE LONG TERM

04:39:42.765 --> 04:39:44.734
FISCAL FORECAST IS APPROPRIATE

04:39:44.801 --> 04:39:46.603
THEY'VE TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS TO

04:39:46.669 --> 04:39:47.504
DEAL WITH THEIR GENERAL FUND

04:39:47.570 --> 04:39:49.539
DEFICIT THERE THEY HAVE STRONGER

04:39:49.606 --> 04:39:50.907
BUDGETING PRACTICES IT CETERA.

04:39:50.974 --> 04:39:53.543
SO THE AUDIT THAT WE CONDUCT MAY

04:39:53.610 --> 04:39:54.711
RESULT IN.

04:39:54.777 --> 04:39:56.146
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

04:39:56.212 --> 04:39:58.381
CATEGORIZED AS A HIGH RISK CITY

04:39:58.448 --> 04:40:00.083
THEY HAVE ISSUES BUT THEY HAVE

04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:01.784
GOOD PLANS IN PLACE AND THEY'VE

04:40:01.851 --> 04:40:02.752
ADDRESSED A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS

04:40:02.819 --> 04:40:04.420
THE CONTROLLER IDENTIFIED FOUR

04:40:04.487 --> 04:40:05.421
YEARS AGO.

04:40:05.488 --> 04:40:08.158
AND BASED ON OUR PROFESSIONAL

04:40:08.224 --> 04:40:08.725
THEY ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT

04:40:08.791 --> 04:40:10.527
DIRECTION THAT COULD BE A

04:40:10.593 --> 04:40:12.662
POSITIVE OUTCOME OF AN AUDIT

04:40:12.729 --> 04:40:13.897
THAT THIS COMMITTEE APPROVES AT

04:40:13.963 --> 04:40:15.165
MY OFFICE WOULD CONDUCT AND

04:40:15.231 --> 04:40:17.333
MONITORING IS AN ADEQUATE FOR

04:40:17.400 --> 04:40:18.968
WHAT REASON.

04:40:19.035 --> 04:40:20.303
MONITORING WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE

04:40:20.370 --> 04:40:22.472
AUTHORITY TO ACCESS CERTAIN

04:40:22.539 --> 04:40:24.073
MATERIALS IT WOULD BE LIMITED TO

04:40:24.140 --> 04:40:25.241
WHAT THE CITY WOULD BE WILLING

04:40:25.308 --> 04:40:26.409
TO SHARE WITH US.

04:40:26.476 --> 04:40:28.411
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE STATUTORY

04:40:28.478 --> 04:40:29.078
AUTHORITY TO GET OUT TO THE CITY

04:40:29.145 --> 04:40:30.914
AND WE COULD HOPEFULLY GO OUT

04:40:30.980 --> 04:40:31.581
AND VISIT THE CITY AND TALK TO

04:40:31.648 --> 04:40:32.415
THEM ABOUT.

04:40:32.482 --> 04:40:34.117
ANY PUBLICLY AND FOR PUBLICLY

04:40:34.184 --> 04:40:35.518
AVAILABLE INFORMATION THEY WOULD

04:40:35.585 --> 04:40:36.853
BE WILLING TO SHARE WITH US.

04:40:36.920 --> 04:40:38.121
THE AUTHORITY --

04:40:38.188 --> 04:40:40.056
ONCE THIS AUDIT IS APPROVED IF

04:40:40.123 --> 04:40:41.991
IT IS OUR STATUTORY AUTHORITY AS

04:40:42.058 --> 04:40:44.260
FAR AS ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

04:40:44.327 --> 04:40:46.863
ARE WOULD BE MUCH MUCH STRONGER

04:40:46.930 --> 04:40:47.797
MEN ARE STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR

04:40:47.864 --> 04:40:49.766

WITH A JURISDICTION THAT WILLING

04:43:27.090 --> 04:43:29.092
TO KIND OF COOPERATE SO.

04:43:29.158 --> 04:43:30.526
I'M HERE TO TO SAY AS A AND THEY

04:43:30.593 --> 04:43:32.161
HAVE THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

04:43:32.228 --> 04:43:33.296
YOU DO HAVE THE CITY'S

04:43:33.363 --> 04:43:35.098

BUT I THINK THAT IF IT'S NOT ON

04:43:53.049 --> 04:43:53.549
THAT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A

04:43:53.616 --> 04:43:55.118

I'LL BUT HAVE WITH THE DIS

05:28:42.369 --> 05:28:43.370
CREASE IT WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE

05:28:43.437 --> 05:28:44.938

BUT HE GOT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT --

05:32:27.027 --> 05:32:28.528
THAT THERE WERE SOME OF THESE

05:32:28.595 --> 05:32:29.429
ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE

05:32:29.496 --> 05:32:30.730

[inaudible]

05:32:39.039 --> 05:32:40.840
BECAUSE THE SOME OF THE FOLKS

05:32:40.907 --> 05:32:41.775
THAT HAVE MADE THE ALLEGATIONS

05:32:41.841 --> 05:32:43.610
FEAR RETALIATION.

05:32:43.677 --> 05:32:45.679
AND SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

05:32:45.745 --> 05:32:47.013

A COMPLETE SET OF OF ALLEGATIONS

05:32:48.381 --> 05:32:50.650
BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT WOULD

05:32:50.717 --> 05:32:51.951
HAPPEN THAT VETTING WHAT

05:32:52.018 --> 05:32:53.453
HAPPENED DURING THAT THE AUDIT

05:32:53.520 --> 05:32:55.522
WHERE IF THE CONFIDENTIALITY TO

05:32:55.588 --> 05:32:56.723

BY SOME THE OPPOSITION IS TRUE

05:33:03.563 --> 05:33:05.532
THEN AND THAT WOULD BE

05:33:05.598 --> 05:33:06.533
DEFINITIVELY STATED IN THE AUDIT

05:33:06.599 --> 05:33:08.601
BUT NOW THAT THE ALLEGATIONS

05:33:08.668 --> 05:33:10.036
THAT BEEN RAISED ARE DISTURBING

05:33:10.103 --> 05:33:11.237
IN CONCERNING --

05:33:11.304 --> 05:33:12.672

05:34:24.677 --> 05:34:26.012
PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE --

05:34:26.079 --> 05:34:27.680
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND I GOT

05:34:27.747 --> 05:34:32.886
INVOLVED WHEN A NUMBER OF

05:34:32.952 --> 05:34:35.388

05:34:37.690 --> 05:34:39.959
CONCERNS AND WE SHARED WITH US.

05:34:40.026 --> 05:34:42.462
THAT THERE HAD BEEN MULTIPLE

05:34:42.529 --> 05:34:43.897

TO THERE WERE MEETINGS THAT

05:34:47.934 --> 05:34:49.836
DIDN'T LEAD TO SOLUTIONS.

05:34:49.903 --> 05:34:50.403
I THOUGHT THERE WERE ACTUAL

05:34:50.470 --> 05:34:53.139
FORMAL FORMAL --

05:34:53.206 --> 05:34:54.207

05:34:55.775 --> 05:34:57.610
AFFAIRS WITH WITH THAT IDEA J.

05:34:57.677 --> 05:35:00.180
THAT DID NOT LEAD TO A SOLUTION.

05:35:00.246 --> 05:35:02.215
SO IT WAS SHARED WITH US THAT

05:35:02.282 --> 05:35:04.317
THAT INTERIM STEPS OUT TO WORK

SOLUTIONS OR RESOLUTION OF THE

05:35:12.125 --> 05:35:13.226
PROBLEM IN FACT IN SOME CASES IT

05:35:13.293 --> 05:35:14.928
GOT WORSE --

05:35:14.994 --> 05:35:15.795
WAS SHARED WITH US THAT

05:35:15.862 --> 05:35:17.464
RETALIATION ENSUED AND

05:35:17.530 --> 05:35:18.698

05:35:20.133 --> 05:35:21.768
OCCURRED AFTER --

05:35:21.835 --> 05:35:23.670
CONCERNS WERE RAISED AND ALL

05:35:23.736 --> 05:35:25.839
THAT WAS A RED FLAG FOR US WHERE

05:35:25.905 --> 05:35:26.339
WE SAID LET'S HAVE AN

05:35:26.406 --> 05:35:28.208
