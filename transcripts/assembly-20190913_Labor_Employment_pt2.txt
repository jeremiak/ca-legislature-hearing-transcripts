AN ITEM FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ EIGHTY ONE SEVENTY. WE JUST RECEIVED FROM THE SENATE SIDE AND IT'S A WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR. AND PASSED HIS HIS OFFICE. THE BILL THAT CAN. THIS IS MY BILL I'M ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO IT I THINK IT IS A DISGRACE THAT THE SENATE SHOVED DOWN MY THROAT. TO PRESENT HERE TODAY BECAUSE SOMETIMES FARMWORKERS HAVE NOBODY IS YEAH. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE STATE. THE DYNAMICS DECISION WAS CLEARLY WRITTEN WITH THESE TYPES OF WORKERS OF MINE. WORKERS WHO EVERY SINGLE DAY EVERY SINGLE DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR OUR MISCLASSIFIED BY THEIR EMPLOYER. AND FORCED TO WORK UNDER CONDITIONS THAT NONE OF US WOULD BELIEVE IN FIRST SUB MINIMUM WAGE. AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF. THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS WHATEVER I LOVE IT IS CLEAR UNDER FINANCES THEY CANNOT. FIVE FIVE ABC TEST AND SO AS A RESULT OF NOT GETTING AN EXEMPTION OUT OF AB FIVE IN A TRADITIONAL WAY THEY CHOSE TO WEAPONIZE. IF YOU JUST. IN A WAY THAT HAS CAUSED US TO COME TO A POSITION WHERE I WAS FORCED TO I'M NOT A BILL. AS A CONDITION OF GETTING AB FIVE OFF THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND PRACTICES OF. MANY OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SIR CHAIR OF THE RIVER JIM YOU WERE PROBABLY USED PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR CARRYING THE THREAT TO THE INDUSTRY. IS POWERFUL SADDAM IS STILL SECRET. NEWSPAPERS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS NOW AND THIS WILL GIVE US SOME GREEN SPACE TO COME UP WITH. MODEL THAT IT COULD WORK FOR THE VALUES EXPRESSED IN AB FIVE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. IN THE ONE. THIS GIVES TO US ON TO GET THAT DONE AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A. ANYONE ELSE PARDON ME ASSURE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY HASN'T HELPED THE STATE PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. BEING THE ONE OF THE STRONGEST SUPPORTER OF EIGHTY FIVE. WE REALIZE. THE TWELFTH AND DELICATE PROCESS TO. WORK WITH INDUSTRY AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THAT SORT OF MIDDLE GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIGHT WAS GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES FOR ALL WORKERS. THIS IS A PART OF THE NEGOTIATION. TO ALLOW AB ONE SEVENTY TO HAVE A ONE YEAR DELAY OF THE MEDITATION OF THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH COMPLETELY FOR THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY. BOB AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH. THE. THE ADVOCATES FOR THE INDUSTRY WILL BE. THAT THEY MUST BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD. AND ALSO COME TO THIS COMMITTEE AND TALK ABOUT A TRANSITION RATHER THAN JUST A DELAY FOR ONE YEAR WHERE THERE'S A CON ABILITY FOR FAIR CONTRACTING POLICIES WHETHER INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND ALSO TO LOOK AT IT THERE ARE VIOLATIONS OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS WHETHER THEY'RE CONVERTING THOSE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FROM FOR USE AND TRULY MAKING SURE THAT THE BUSINESS OF THEIR CLAIM OUR BUSINESS AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. ARE SUCH SO THAT MEANS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE KERRIER AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEIR COMMITMENTS TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS I THINK GO A LONG WAY AND. WERE OPEN DISCUSS CONTINUES OVER THE REASON WE ASK. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. IT WOULDN'T TAKE THAT SEAT THE END THERE. HI FI AXES GOOD EVENING EVERYONE MONIES TO TRACK LITTLE I AM AN ATTORNEY WITH THE LAW FIRM OF POTTER HE NEEDS.

AND SHE WOULD SHOW UP TO THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER WHICH WASN'T HE DID FOR HER COOL. AND PICKED UP HER USE PAPER AND PAKISTANIS PAPERS WHEN THEY CAN'T WANTED TO. AND SHE DROVE. JOHNNY CARD SHE DROVE. FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE TO HOUSE SHE WAS TOLD YEAH AND WAS PAID BETWEEN TEN CENTS. THIRTY CENTS PER HOUSE IT SHOULD DELIVER TO. IF YOU MISS THE DELIVERY. YEAH IT WOULD TAKE A POP OUT OF. PERHAPS IF SHE WANTED TO QUIT. GET IT WOULD CHARGER CHARGE FOR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SHE MISSED TODAY YEAH CHARGE FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS CHIEF FOREIGN CAR SHAPE FROM CELL PHONE TWO IN GPS GENOCIDE TABLET. FROM FROM CANADA AS WELL I. AND ALL AROUND EXPENSE. AT AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS RARE BUT THIS IS.

WITHIN AFFECTED BY THIS COMPANY WHICH HAS ITS ANNUAL REVENUE THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN ANNUAL PROFIT FOR BILLION DOLLARS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE COURSE OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND THE CASE LAW IS COME OUT YOU WILL FIND. USES NEWSPAPER CARRIERS HAVE GONE ON. THE POLICE CASE I THINK NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT. NOW I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR USE. I UNDERSTAND REPORT. BUT AB ONE SEVENTY DOESN'T PROTECT NEWSPAPERS PROTECTS NEWSPAPER DISTRICT. AND SO AND THOSE COMPANIES GIVE ME FOR SURE. THE OTHER THING I WOULD MENTION. SO THAT WE TALK ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE AND THAT THE DYNAMICS THE SIX MINUTES DYNAMIC FIVE ON THAT FROM DEFENSE COUNSEL. A LOT OF YOU ONCE. ANYWAY ON THIS THE DYNAMICS DECISION WE THINK THAT THAT IS BEING SHOP. BREAK EVERYTHING DOWN. AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU. THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS IS USED AGENCIES HAVE BACKED AWAY THAT HE FIVE DOLLARS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE YOUR STILL NEWSPAPER MASSACHUSETTS. ANOTHER ELEVEN DOLLARS USE THE AB TEST ABC TESTED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER FUNDING PLAN INSURANCE IS COMPENSATION AND THERE ARE STILL NEWSPAPERS IN THE STATE'S. ARE SO. AND SO. RECHARGE THE IDEA THAT AB. ONE SEVENTY IF WE GIVE THE NEWSPAPERS AN EXTRA YEAR CLEAN UP THEIR ACT. YAHOO THE WHITE WILL THE CLOUDS APART AND EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. IS IT GOING TO WORK. AS I SAID THE VERY FIRST CASE ON THIS HE NOW NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT THERE'S ACTUALLY THERE'S ACTUALLY A BROADWAY PLAY ABOUT THE ABUSES OF A NEWSPAPER DELIVERY A NEWSPAPER CARRIERS. ON CALL PAPER PLATES EXCEPT IN CALIFORNIA THEY WERE NEVER NEVER NEVER PAPER THEY'RE ALWAYS ADULTS BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG STATE. AND PEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE EVERYWHERE EVEN EVEN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND THE NINETEEN FORTIES NINETEEN FIFTIES. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. I'M SORRY WAY I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HEARING ME OUT TONIGHT. AND YEAH. AND I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU RECONSIDER. WHAT THE SENATE HAS PUT FORWARD I THINK. IS THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW AGAIN. WE CAN JUST IGNORE THIS ISSUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR. IT IS COSTS SO MUCH MORE. I THINK IT IS A REAL PROBLEM AND BY THE WAY IN A LAWSUIT OVER SEATING IS REALLY JUST THE BARE MINIMUM WE'RE NOT SEEKING ADDITIONAL. L. ROCK WERE BASICALLY SEEKING. TWO THREE MS AARONSON AND HER CO WORKERS. UP TO THE MINIMUM WAGE. SHE ON AVERAGE EARN ABOUT THREE DOLLARS NOW. WORKING THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR NO WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS. THANK YOU AGAIN. AND. HAVE A GOOD DAY. THANK YOU MISTER I KNOW THAT YOU WENT TO SOME TROUBLE TO COME HERE UNDER VERY SHORT VERY SHORT NOTICE AND THANK YOU FOR ADVOCACY. FOR THE WORKERS REPRESENTING THEM. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE VERY POWERFUL PRESENTATION. YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT BEING A LEGISLATOR IS THAT WE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS I AM A FORMER JOURNALIST. I GRADUATED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN OVER FOUR HUNDRED NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SHUT DOWN. IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY HARD FOR ME TO GET A JOB. SO I RAN FOR OFFICE. YEAH AND THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT THAT IS THAT. AS SOMEBODY THAT BELIEVES. IN THE POWER OF THE PRESS POWER OF MEDIA THE POWER OF A JOURNALIST IS SEEN THE LAST FEW YEARS. JOURNALIST BE KICKED OUT OF POLITICAL PRESS CONFERENCES BE KICKED OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND KNOW THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS SO DEPENDENT. ON JOURNALISTS TO TELL THE STORY TO THE PUBLIC. WE DON'T GET THAT. JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY AS A JOURNALIST RIGHT SAID AND GET SOME MINOR GETS ON A PAPER IT RELIES ON COPY EDITORS RESEARCHERS. THE VERY PEOPLE THAT DELIVER THE NEWSPAPER THAT GETS TO OUR HANDS THAT GETS TO THIS BUILDING. SO I'M I'M SADDENED THIS WAS ALL IS THAT YOU HAD TO TAKE THIS AMENDMENT TO MOST SOMETHING. THAT IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WE- THINK ABOUT. WORKERS IN THE FUTURE WORK ACROSS THE STATE. AND I REALLY DO HOPE MISTER YOU WERE THAT WE CAN. WORK TOGETHER AND KNOW THAT. THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US THAT WILL BE LOOKING TO YOU. AND HOLD YOUR INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THAT YOU ARE GETTING THIS ONE YEAR EXTRA. BUT THAT THE WORKERS THAT DELIVER THE NEWSPAPERS THAT WE ALL RELY ON FOR OUR DEMOCRACY WORK. ACTUALLY OUR REPRESENTATIVE HAVE AT THE VERY MINIMUM MINIMUM WAGE. AND SO WE WILL. THE VOTING ON THIS AND I'LL SEE HOW IT GOES ON THE FLOOR. BUT AS SOMEBODY THAT HAS WORKED IN THAT INDUSTRY AND KNOWS THAT FROM A RESEARCHER TO A COPY EDITOR TO. ORDER TO THE PRINT SHOP TO THE MECHANICS TO THE DELIVERY. ACTUALLY GETTING THE PAPER IN OUR HANDS. AND TO KNOW THAT THIS THE STORY OF THIS WOMAN WHO WAS PAID ON AVERAGE THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT IS NOT OUR DEMOCRACY THAT IS NOT HOW. ANYONE SHOULD BE GETTING PAID AND SO AS AS- EXCELLENT CONVEY THAT TO YOU THAT THAT THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT BEING IN IN THIS POSITION NOW IS THAT WE DO ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND SOME OF US UNDERSTAND DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. A LITTLE BIT MORE PERSONALLY. FIVE I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT THE NEXT YEAR BRINGS IN TERMS OF BRINGING. THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY INTO THE TABLE AND HOLDING. HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WORKERS ARE PAID FAIRLY. THANK YOU THIS IS THE SENSOR AND A HALF AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL. AND I CAN. STANDS GONZALEZ IS CONCERNED AND. AS A FORMER PAPER BOY. IN HARTFORD CONNECTICUT DELIVERING PAPERS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A WEEK DESPITE ACE THE YEAR FOR TWO YEARS I'M TALKING ABOUT IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT'S HOT IS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO KEEP IT IN THE WINTER WHEN IT'S COLD AS HELL DELIVERING NEWSPAPERS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE STILL PAYING THEM WHAT I WAS GETTING PAID IN THE SIXTIES. IS RIDICULOUS. THAT'S WHAT I WAS MAKING BACK THEN IN THE SIXTIES WHAT THIS WOMAN IS MAKING NOW. YES WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND DO THIS WHEN YOU BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. JUST LIKE THE PAPERS SIGNED THE LIGHT ON US. THIS LIFE NOW BEEN SHINED ON THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY. AND YOU HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS TO GET THIS RIGHT. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT. MY COLLEAGUES FACES WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THIS GO. AND LIKE I ALWAYS SAY IN EVERY MEETING YOU NEVER EVER EVER NEVER EVER. ONE ELECTED OFFICIAL TO FIX YOUR PROBLEM. WITH WORSE. AND I MEAN THAT. I REALLY DO MEAN THAT YOU NEVER EVER EVER WANT US TO INTERFERE AND WHEN I HEAR BUSINESSES AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE OTHER SIDE SAY WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED AND STUFF. IS BECAUSE. THAT INDUSTRY DOESN'T FIX THEIR STUFF. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. SO THE LEAST YOU HAVE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT AND IF YOU DON'T. THAT LIGHT BEEN SKITTISH TURNED AROUND ON YOU. AND THEY WILL COME UP WITH THINGS THAT MAKE IT SO BAD YOU WISH YOU. YOU WOULD NEVER CUT IS. RIGHT AND SO I IMPLORE YOU. HI COREY TO FIX THIS IN A FIX THIS QUICK SO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. FIRST YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO COMMEND THE OFF HER FOR HER WORK OVER THE PAST YEAR ON THE EIGHTY FIVE YOU KNOW I HEARD FROM YOU OF YOUR STORIES AND HAVE WITNESSED THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS YOU KNOW THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEHIND THIS ANY OF THIS YEAR I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WORKERS AND WHAT EIGHTY FIVE WILL DO FOR ESPECIALLY FROM SOME OF THAT DON'T HAVE ANYBODY THAT REPRESENTS THEM. RIGHT AND I THINK OF MY CONSTITUENTS SWITCH A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE NOT IN C. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT IN A PROFESSION THAT REPRESENTS THEM AND. WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE I RAN FOR THEM. AND. AND I AM HERE TO REPRESENT THEM AND- I SEE. IN THE MORNINGS I SEE PEOPLE WITH THEIR FAMILIES. WAKING UP REALLY EARLY TAKING THEIR KIDS ON HOPE FOR SCHOOL AND THROWING OUT THE NEWSPAPERS AND TO THINK THAT THAT WHOLE FAMILY WORKING TOGETHER IS MAKING THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR IS JUST AN ACCEPTABLE. AND YOU KNOW THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT. OURS ARE COUNTING ON SO I NEED TO REPRESENT THEM AND I CAN. THERE ARE OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT DID NOT GET AN EXTRA YEAR TO THINK ABOUT THIS INCLUDING INDUSTRIES THAT I THOUGHT MAYBE SHOULD OF LIKE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS SCIENTISTS THAT WERE ALL OVER THAT GET PAID ARE HIGHLY SKILLED AND HIGHLY PAID AND ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT THEM. AND WHO ARE THE LAST HOUR I'M DOING THIS FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE. THAT TO REPRESENTATION AND I JUST. YOU KNOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING. AND SO. IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS. BECAUSE I THINK OF THOSE WORKERS THEY DON'T HAVE ANYONE. FANS IT'S JUST A VERY TOUGH IT AND I HOPE THAT THIS NEXT YEAR THAT. THEN THE NEWSPAPER DISTRIBUTORS AND THIS INDUSTRY REALLY COMES UP WITH A PLAN THAT. LIKE MY COLLEAGUES EXPRESSED WILL. WE'LL PAID A FAIR WAGE. TO THESE JUST PLEASE WORKERS. THANK YOU THE OTHER COMMENT. I JUST SAY LOOK I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I'VE HAD THE DISTINCT PROVISION HONOR OF HAVING A FRONT ROW SEAT WATCHING A SUMMER LEARNING GONZALEZ. AS AS SHE HAS FOUGHT HARDER THAN ANYONE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE FOR WORKERS. AND WAY THAT SOME POWERFUL THE WAY THAT IN A MATTER WHAT SHE'S BEEN. DILLON EYES DEMONIZED. AND YET CONTINUES TO FIGHT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT SHE'S FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR THEM. FOR THE SENATE TO PUT HER IN THIS POSITION I THINK IS BENEATH. DIGNITY OF LEGISLATION WE SERVICE. I GET POLITICS I UNDERSTAND THAT HAPPENS I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE RULES OF PROCEDURES AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS FOR. LEGISLATORS TO BE ABLE TO PUSH THEIR AGENDA AND I GET ALL THAT I'M NOT NAIVE TO THE- BUT FOR THEM TO DO THIS TO OUR COLLEAGUE. WAS ALWAYS HOLD HER SUB HIGH ENOUGH THAT HONORABLY AND I'M IN A IN A SELFLESS MANNER. I THINK IS. I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION RUNNING AS WELL WHICH IS IT IS IT THIS IS NOT JUST OF THE PROPOSITION THAT. THE AUTHORS PUT AND IT'S IT IS DIFFICULT JUST NOT BUT IT'S AWESOME. AND OUR SPEAKER AND OF THE ASSEMBLY AS A WHOLE BECAUSE. OF THE MANNER IN WHICH. THIS BILL IS MOVE FORWARD AND I GET THE LOOK THIS INDUSTRY IS NOT UNIQUE THERE'S DOZENS OF OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT I'VE- ASKED MORE TIME AND ASK FOR EXEMPTIONS IS SO. THIS IS ONE OF MANY BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS INDUSTRY DOES HAVE. A LOT OF POWER AND INFLUENCE AND THAT'S ALSO IS NOT SOMETHING UNIQUE TO. TODAY THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT IN THIS BUILDING. I DO TAKE THE INDUSTRY HAS WORDING CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD IN TERMS OF WHAT WE- HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS YEAR. THERE'S GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN IN EVEN EVEN IF THE PROCESS IS A MESSY ONE THAT WE DON'T. WE DON'T LIKE. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE END RESULT HAS TO BE SOMETHING WE DON'T LIKE. AND SO COME. YOU KNOW I'M CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO ENSURE THAT THIS pTHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE WORKER AND THE WORKERS THAT ARE STRUGGLING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. WHAT WE WANT AND RESOLVED TO LOOK LIKE. THE NEW CIVIC INDUSTRY USUALLY PLACES A SPOTLIGHT ON OTHERS AND AS INDICATED BY SOME JONES SAWYER. THE SPOTLIGHT IS NOW ON ON THEM IN TERMS OF. HOW THIS NEXT YEAR WILL LOOK LIKE AS IT RELATES. TO MISS CLASSIFICATION AS IT RELATES TO THE. I NAPA DYNAMICS AND THE WORK THAT THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THE NOT JUST SOME RUDY SALAS HAS BROUGH THIS FOR THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE. CERTAINLY MY STAFF HERE THE LABOR COMMITTEE BUT ALSO THE LABOR FEDERATION THE BUILDING TRADES AND THIS IS NOT THE THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK PUTTING TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT AND WE KNOW WE'RE NOT PERFECT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET EVERYTHING RIGHT. BUT BUT WE DO KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING REALLY HARD I KNOW THAT ARE AUTHOR OF AB FIVE IS BEEN TRYING HARDER THAN. ANYONE TO TRY TO GET IT RIGHT. THE WORKERS AND TO RESPECT THE SUPREME COURT AS WELL AND THEIR DECISION. WHICH WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT IF WE DO NOTHING AB FIVE DOESN'T. ONCE THAT HAPPENS. THAT EVERYBODY HAS A. B. C. TEST SO IT'S NOT A MATTER OF JUST TRYING TO STICK IT TO ONE GROUP ONE INDUSTRY OR THE OTHER. AND THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF. OF TELLING NEWSPAPERS ANY OTHER INDUSTRY TO. TO NOT BE INCLUDED BUT BECAUSE THERE'S- AN ISSUE WITH OPTICAL INDUSTRIES BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX VERY COMPLICATED. AND THE DAY THE MUSIC INDUSTRY ITSELF IS NOT A MONOLITH AND IT HAS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY TO IT AS WELL. AND I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES INCLUDING IT MAYBE FIVE OF THOSE REASONS. BUT WE HAVE. HERE SB ONE SEVENTY AND. I JUST I JUST HOPE THAT AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY WE CAN DO BETTER THAT WE DO BETTER. YOU DO BETTER BY OUR COLLEAGUES. BECAUSE ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS ARE BETTER BUT- ESPECIALLY SOME AMERICANS OFFICERS BETTER. THAN THAN THIS AND SO. WE HAVE A MOTION TO THE. CURRENT STABILITY THE. CORRECT WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION IS MY RECOMMENDATION BUT THE MOTION IS. THE PAST WITH THE WORD RECEPTIVE. THE GROUND CONCURRENT CURRENTS OF THE CURRENT LAW CENTER. YEAH AND YEAH OF COURSE AND SO BUT AFTER THE ALSO HAS AN OPPORTUNITY CLOSE AND CONNECTED YES I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST YEAH. I YEAH IT WAS FORCED TO TAKE THIS BILL. BUT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT I WOULD NOT SO. AND THAT'S A HIGHLY UNUSUAL SITUATION BUT IT'S. WOULD BE FOR ME TO ACTUALLY CONTEST GIVEN. ZERO EIGHTY FIVE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT MIGHT MAKING THEIR HIKES WITH PIECEMEAL BUT FACT IT WASN'T THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE CONSIDERED IN WAYS WE LOOK AT INDUSTRIES THE NUMBER ONE TEAM HOW HARD HOW HIGH IS THE BARRIER TO ENTRY IN A PROFESSION BUT WOULD BE EXEMPTED BECAUSE THE HIGHER THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY OF COURSE THE MORE INDIVIDUAL LEVERAGED AN IN. HOUSE FOR PARDON ME. WE LOOKED AT HOW MUCH PEOPLE MADE AND IN FACT. THOUGHT THAT YOU SHOULD BE MAKING JUST LIKE OUR. OUR STATE LAW REQUIRES TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE IN ORDER TO BE EXEMPT FROM BEING IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CELERY EXEMPT. INDIVIDUAL MAKES THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT IF YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT OVER TIME AND- AND MET THEY IN MALE BREAKS AND REST BREAKS. I. ALSO WITH THE NEWSPAPER GIRL. TWELVE AND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN I'M- AND IT WAS ACTUALLY EVEN WORSE THAN IT IS TODAY HE DID COLLECT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR HERE NEWSPAPERS AND IF YOU DON'T COLLECT FROM THE INDIVIDUALS NHIáU. HOW TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY SO I SPEND A LOT TIME HUSTLING. TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY YOU KNOW AND I'M WORKING CLASS AREA TO GET THEM TO. PAY IN CASH THE TWELVE YEAR OLD IS WAS FUN. BUT I HAD TO DO IT. I ALSO. NO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AND WE TALKED A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO IN. JUST GENERALLY IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. WHOSE PARENTS HOW TO DO THIS AS A JOB. WITH KIDS IN TOW. STARTING AT LIKE THREE IN THE MORNING. THEY CAN'T PAPERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN ANY OTHER JOB IF YOU WORK SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WE EXPECT DOUBLE TIME. THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY. HAS REALISTICALLY SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL. FOR DECADES. THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO COUNTLESS LAWSUITS UNDER BRELO. NOW AND DYNAMAX DYNAMICS. AND THEY CONTINUE SAY THEY CANNOT THE FILL. THE OBLIGATIONS OF PAIN THE LOS WORKERS THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS THE UNREPRESENTED WORKERS THE WORKERS TO DO THEIR WORK OUT OF THE SITE MOST PEOPLE. ON MINIMUM WAGE. FURTHERMORE THEY DID USE THEIR. EDITORIAL PAGES TO COMMAND THE OVERALL DESIRES OF AB FIVE IN SAME FACT MOST CERVANTES YOU KNOW SOMETHING DOES HAVE TO BE DONE ABOUT THE ECONOMY BUT IT'S A LOT NOT A WELL THOUGHT OUT BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD AFFECT. HE NEVER QUITE GOT TO HAPPEN BASICALLY. GOOD INTENTIONS BUT PROBLEMATIC. I SUPPORT JOURNALISM. TO MY MOST POLICE YOU KNOW IT TROUBLES ME TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING. I DON'T WANT TO SEE A NEWS. CURRENT THAT'S DIANA I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO HYPOCRITICAL. FOR THE NEWSPAPERS. RIGHT SAME DOING SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ALL BE PLASTIC FOREIGN EDITORIALS IF IT WAS ANYTHING ELSE. END OF SESSION. DARK OF NIGHT GOT MAN. FOR AN INDUSTRY WITHOUT RATIONAL THOUGHT BECAUSE IT FITS INTO NOTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO. THE FIRST MOMENTS IMPORTANT. BUT IN REGARD TO FOR TREATING PEOPLE LIKE. WE DON'T ALLOW CHURCHES. TO NOT PAY THEIR WORKERS MINIMUM WAGE. HE HAS A RELIGIOUS IN NATURE. SO I JUST WANT TO BE VERY HONEST I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS YEAR WERE ON THE FLOOR IF IT GETS OUT. AND I AM SORRY THAT WE ARE IN THIS POSITION I WOULD LOVE TO SAY THAT IT WAS AN ASSOCIATION BUT NEGOTIATIONS USUALLY HAVE TWO SIDES AND I HAD. NO OTHER CHOICE. BUDGET REQUEST FOR. AS A CONDITION OF BRINGING AND PASSING AB FIVE SO WITH THAT. THAT'S ABOUT. THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE THE AT THE MOTION.
