morning- thank you for being here today my name's remember Blanca Rubio and I am proud to represent the city of convenience ina I wanna thank you all for participating today as chair of the assembly select committee on domestic violence and on behalf of my fellow committee members thank you to everyone for being a part of these important conversations today I am especially grateful to the city of convene an for hosting us and the server writers for participating as panelists and part of the resource fair. The theme of this hearing centers on the notion that domestic violence- and intimate partner violence affects people of all races gender sexual orientations age groups and social economic statuses I'm are three panel panels will highlight best practices for law enforcement local resources and how we can specifically support the B. T. R. Q. plus survivors were as- LGBTQ plus as for lesbian gay bisexual Trask transgender transsexual queer questioning intersects a special ally and sexual before we begin with calls I would like to share some statistics. Provide contact to the urgency of topic. Day on average twenty four people per minute are victims of rape physical violence or stocking by an intimate partner in the United States. More than twelve million women and men over the course of a year. Let me just be really clear I. This is my third year and the assembly and- being part of the domestic violence on committee and when we have these conversations it's been very eye opening for me when we talk about the mystic violence that everyone really it just automatically assumes that the victim is a female. Now I want to make clear that victims are everywhere not just females we have males are victims as well and as I stated there's a list of other folks that are victims and the part- died really frustrates me is the conversation about children- somewhere I read that- when there's an issue with the mystic violence the statistic automatically goes either to the victim. Or the perpetrator but if a child is involved in that that householder an altercation the children are not designated as domestic violence victims so the statistics are skewed in my opinion because yes domestic violence a affects into my partners and their. But while the other partner but when the children are present at these these events and we all know that this is very common- somehow they're left out of the conversation. And my fear is that if we don't start acknowledging in addressing the issue of children in these domestic violence situations we are. Are not assisting in their mental health- well being and some of these our kits unfortunately grow up to. To be abusers themselves or be victims because they saw that it was normal played home and so one of the things I want to stress. And continue to stress and hopefully we can do some legislative work on it is that kids are all part of this conversation as well. And again yes the resources are for the victims and- and some cases for or- the abusers but the kids need our support as well- watching their parents- fight or their mom or dad being victimized does not do the many well. Plus I was a former teacher and- it was unfortunate that in the classroom you see manifestations of this abuse I enough short quick story I was and. I Ste I taught fourth grade my last- eight years- I was a teacher for sixteen years and no one of my students came in and he's you know kind of. Not focusing on my care you okay as a like no because my dad was hitting my mom last night very matter of fact I go yeah you know my- so we weren't able to sleep bye. Bye yeah but I'll be fine. Very matter of fact and it just hurt me because for him it was just a normal occurrence. Right and I was just like as a teacher I don't know what to do. Do I say sorry you do I you know so of course I went to the administration. But the point is that what happens in the household gets manifested in the classrooms and sometimes we wonder why kids are not achieving. You know we expect them to go in and be ready to learn when. There eight have witnessed domestic violence either the night before or that morning sometimes they don't have food because a lot of the domestic violence. Are symptoms are also withholding- monetary- or money or food or whatever it may be and the kids are victims of this as well no I went off on a little tangent on that one but I think it's very important for us to also. I acknowledge that that work also needs to be done I'm not just in assisting the kids but also in counting him. As part of this is growing up in the making as much work as we've done in the last. Decade I it just feels like we haven't even. Touched any you know I just feels that way that we haven't really done much work I know we keep. Talking about it- and again part of the other reason that I see a problem is we always try to address and assist the victims which is. Great right because we want to help them right I don't feel that we're addressing the actual issue which is the abuser if the abuser has mental health issues other it they have Tehama. And we're not addressing that issue we're helping the victims which again is why what we want to do but we're not curing were not really helping the abuser not abuse anymore so what's going to happen is. We're going to remove that family from that particular abuser but he's going to go and read that might here she are it's going to go be victimized. Another person because we haven't addressed their their issues or their trauma and so it's a complicated very very complicated issue and- you know my hopes is that in the next. I'm nine years- if I continue to be. Somebody that I will try to address that issue in particular because we can- help victims unless we are helping- the abuser well. So anyway the- the panelists- thank you for being here but also the resources we have resources outside and sometimes we don't realize that you know it all and sometimes it just takes a phone call. We do have a twenty four seven national domestic violence hotline can be reached at. 1-800-799-7233 and- that should also be part of the conversation- and- let's see what else. So we'll go ahead and get started with our first panel joining us on the first panel at law enforcement on best practices for domestic violence calls we can be Espinoza- think he said- she is from the city of bottom park and we've- I do. A lot of together. As Senate and reveals up as. We have. Aye she's a community resource officer of domestic violence advocate for by the park police department. Are we have David Rodriguez patrol sergeant for the Cabana police department. Janica more in Pascua community services officer green police department and domestic violence prevention expert. And we're going to have my towel detective crimes against persons unit from the glory Glendora police department but popped out before we get started. I would also like to acknowledge and thank- those- of folks that are here in the audience with us today- first I would like to think the company aye ayes city council- is Patty Cortes a Mister what Walt Allen- for being here thank you for opening up your home to us and- we hope to do more work with you- in the future. We also have convene a police chief John Curley- we have this is a school board member got an idea this is here- thank about Valley- we have a second a valley LGBT Q. center. Board member Sarah as a metal we have a- sees city manager Brian psyche ward Brian thank you Brian and this is city manager manager in your career is here as well- let's see. And of course representing senator Susan reveals off as quite happen to know a little bit- is- center Lopez thank you Sandra I know that the senator also had. A domestic violence round table not so long ago so as you can tell both the senator and I are committed to making sure that the resources folks need. Are available but also make sure that we. As to domestic violence I'm and I believe that's it unless I miss somebody. I thank you again for being here let's see. And I'm some of you know kind of my background I was a teacher for sixteen years- prior to being an assembly member I was a lot of board member and then a school board member at the same time as I was teaching so I have a lot of experience in hearing the reports obviously and seen some of these children go through that. But I also had the experience of having my sister be a victim of domestic violence and so when I started in the assembly three years ago I made it my mission in the assembly sites to make sure that- we brought awareness to that issue I've also passed- several bills. That act- in my mind have helped under the one bill that well there's all the bills I'm proud of but one of them in particular- if a victim of domestic violence is fleeing from- from the situation and are under cal works these to get a voucher for candidates cycle. I'm so that they can go and tell them fully- their abuser well if you're under- trauma you know that ten days is you know you're barely does getting your your parents together and trying to reach her from whatever the truck but you've been suffering soul- the bill that I passed I extended that to thirty days. Now they have- vouchers for thirty days. You know obviously it's not enough by the police it's more than the ten days that- were previous the are given to the victims I also had a and my police- mice public safety friends can can help me with this- there is a bill in particular that was very difficult I thought from. From my perspective as though it was a no brainer. So the federal government have a life ban on- a gun if you. Have a- misdemeanor. Domestic violence missed. On on owning a gun if you've had a misdemeanor- domestic violence and you know I went in there with you know all my statistics in LA county. I'm the to six are eighty nine percent. 89% of the domestic- the misdemeanor domestic violence- with David. Webb and- re offend and I become felonies I was eating 9% something king I got it I got this I've got all the statistics and I was met with. Resistance and- the second amendment was in even the issue. Which was surprising to me because I was going to be faced with you know. In the second amendment you know and that was not the issue the issue what. Are the question from those public safety committee to me was the what if these folks are rehabilitated. What a have a- person that has a domestic violence- misdemeanor is rehabilitated and I if you know me I'm tend to be a little bit forward and- straight forward a little bit sarcastic sometimes I said the shin one of the- why do you need a gun if you're real validated why do you need a gun. And so we went back and forth and- the bill barely passed I- surprisingly got a past- I needed for votes and I had to Republicans and two Democrats that actually voted- to pass that bill and I'm happy to say that it did make it all the way to the governor's office and he signed it this was last year. And it is- the live California now now it is. Our with the federal government that there is a lifetime ban on. Owning a weapon. Is me. If you have a misdemeanor domestic violence. But the reason that I share. With you. Is because we all think of these issues are no brainer is right we all want to protect. Families well want to protect victims but when it comes to the legislative process- we have so many different issues. That that come into play that the things that I thought were the bringers are not. So when we do- bills I to support domestic violence. Victims I am asking for your help. I know that I'm not an expert and I have the experts here. Why I'm going to be calling on you for some help I learned my lesson the last time I went in. Thinking yeah I got this is no big deal and it is. Really a hard fought battle. And when we go into battle I would like you to be part of my- my troops. And so when we start the legislative year. I rolled out of the undoubtedly. Introduced bills to support victims of domestic violence and I'll be calling on all you to help me through that process so. Anyway thank you- again for being here and if we can go ahead and- and get started- with our panel. Again the panel on the title of the panel is law enforcement on best practices for domestic violence calls- if you wanna go ahead and get started since get the one start. Thank you. Good morning and thank you this is an honor to be here so thank you for having us here my name said the estamos Lanham with the bomb park police department I'm their domestic violence advocate there I've been there for ten years and- I do there like I said domestic violence and I'm also their communication sauce officer so I have a lot of contact with the community and what the officers. I'm gonna go ahead and pass it off. Thank you. My name's detective Mike howl and with the Glendora police department. And not investigate all the crimes against persons which include- violence- out investigations from the scene all the three prosecution. Hi my name is Jenna camara Pascua I work with the Covina police department and the community service officer- and I've also been the domestic violence field for over twenty years. Thanks. Good morning- David Rodriguez police sergeant Covina PD- they were department fifteen years- also worked- domestic violence crimes against persons- investigations that it's active select tech the power here Eklund PD- and I'll get started as far as the law enforcement response just because. I'll give the patrol aspect of it and then I could. See as we get to after an arrest I can hand over to detective how who's currently doing investigations. These these crimes so for Covina more talk of being in a specifically to that's what I'm most familiar with- in two thousand nineteen we've had over two hundred M. S. violence calls for service. And those are the calls that we get that's not including unreported domestic violence incidents it's not including rapes not including. Kidnappings stockings is just purely domestic violence incidents- so we had over two hundred. For twenty nineteen. One resulting in a murder suicide at an apartment complex. And it's at the age of twenty eighteen we also had a an officer involved shooting. Resulting from a domestic disturbance at one of our local parks. So. The much the call starts when dispatch gets the call there's a lot going on people are highly emotional these types of- incidents. And dispatch what their job is they're trying to identify from a person who is in distress whose emotional who screaming he was yelling who's going through a lot of stuff- in the background there's children screaming and our dispatchers trying to figure out what exactly is going on so they could send units to that to that residence- they're asking questions such as is there any weapons there is anybody hurt- who's in the house. Is their children there but what's the address what's happening they need to send medical attention they need captions up offenders. Or anyone involved. Already is anybody on the influence of drugs or alcohol. Is there any prior history at that address- has we have we've been out there before for similar incidents. Is a restraining orders on file for that person- does the person on the phone eight are they able to get to a safe place or leave the house. You know hope it. Within their hopefully with the children. And so they're running the address for the prior history- and are staying on the line until the officers get to the to the residents. This is the most dangerous type of call that law enforcement officers respond to. There's just winner emotions are running high with persons especially persons that are in relationships- things could get violent quick. And there's been times when officers have been baited by people cooperating very much and then there ends up being a physical education- so they're just they're very- random and every incident is different there's no similar incident when it comes to domestic violence. So I'll talk about the officers response now we obviously a we send a minimum of two units to these domestic violence calls that's a minimum. We need more we could always ask for more if they're available. Officers in a park away from location so there's not a suspect whiting- waiting in line and- lying in wait- hiding and then you know to assault us- if no one answers the door officers can hear what they think is. A struggle going on inside then we have a we could use existence circumstances to basically force our entry into their. Parties and the children they're gonna be separated. He's going to check for weapons you know we don't know who's we don't know who we get is a suspect or the victim these types of incidents. At source separating them we're getting away from any type of kitchen where there's you know potential weapons such as knives in the bedrooms or there could be guns- even even check in the furniture sometimes a living room just pictures not a gun hidden in the sofa because we want to be heard ourselves. US statements are gonna be came from both parties so they're gonna be separated but still our offices can see each other in case something happens- we're gonna try to establish to the primary aggressors. And identify that based on statements from both both parties as well as any children witnesses or any independent party's neighbors or people that might have heard it. Or you know just any other witnesses that were there at the time so when we gather all the information. We're gonna try we're gonna do our best a terminal primary aggressor in this. The primary aggressor doesn't necessarily have to be someone who you know who struck someone first it could be you know maybe of someone poked the other person and then the other person gets in the head with a pot right the prime address is gonna be the person who use the pot to solve that person. This depends on injury. Not on it the statements are conflicting which happens a lot of people are going to you know say what's beneficial to them so that they don't get in trouble if statements are conflicting- officers they do their best to is to establish based on it the totality of all the circumstances what evidence is there well as more injuries you know what the children say- who's credible and when I say credible and meeting who's you know who's intoxicated and who's not- who was there with with them still it's all that stuff gets taken into a- into account to establish a primary aggressor to make an arrest. Disturbance when they're just when their physical and more than just a verbal- someone's going to jail. For the penal code- so we try to make that determination the best we can and arrest someone from that residents if it's just a verbal altercation we do our best to separate the parties have someone go with a family member somewhere else. For the evening- maybe a local motel if they don't have any family in the area but we do our best to we can't force them to leave. But we do our best to try to get them to use. To have some time to cool off. So in California. What we have family domestic finds a misdemeanor domestic violence. The only domestic violence. Is based on injury if there is any type of injury to the person so could be a scratching him a scratcher Bruce to. You know. Lacerations anything that. You know is consistent with any type of- any trauma to the body. We applies to people every day relationship whether it's current or prior. If they're living together. Any children common if they're married the are separated or divorced. The misdemeanor domestic violence is an allegation of being. Being struck or any type of physical- altercation occurred of happen. So maybe if someone says yeah he punched me in and I have a to show for it we're still gonna rest. You know whoever the offender was that punch the other person. We also have a two seven three six was of violating a domestic violence restraining orders of something already happen. And that and offender comes back and violates restraining order. Then they get arrested for that as well. Officers are gonna document everything in a police report they're gonna photographed the scene they're gonna photograph both parties. Just so that says that the statements are consistent as well. And they're going to consider. Number C. protective order which is a restraining order that can be done right then and there calling a judge doesn't matter any time of the night the judge gets called and we tell the judge exactly what happened verbally and days either grant restraint or they don't rather straining or based on the totality of everything. And then hopefully that person is there so we can provide them with their copy the restraining order so that they know they can't come back for believe it's- thirty days. And days three days. Seven seven days ago. And then a that that put that give the- victim sometime to get rid their own restraining order from the courthouse. Zero so at these were also doing department of children's services- referrals at these locations if there's children there they have children of their children there. There's offices can automatically do a referral to DCFS. And at the edge Chen a east cars will be generated and they'll be some follow up to be conducted by agents from that department. So at that time. A detective will be assigned a case and the to they'll take it the district attorney's office for consideration of a filing for misdemeanor felony- and then the judicial system basically takes over determines jail prison- anger management classes restraining orders. And that's based work I'll give that to the park to the detective how lawyer from going to a party but that's our police patrol officer response to these domestic violence incidents which are very extremely dangerous. One just to point out- you know this whole entire time the emotions are are high not just on there and by. The officers that are responding to those calls also have to be careful about what happened you saw what happened Sacramento to that that young officer that responded to a domestic violence- call and so. That should not be overshadowed either because that domestic violence is happening within that household but we have other victims are other potential victims in in our law enforcement that's trying to you know- deal with that situation so I just. Want to say that in thank you I know it's a tough job and you know we want to make sure that we do everything possible to support law enforcement because at the end of the day your support and you also. Supports those victims. Thank we appreciate that thank you. What will said the project that. So. In my opinion the most balanced cases are actually very difficult to investigate. First of all a lot of times you have witnessed there your time to on a he said she said type of incidents. Where you don't know it's hard to tell who the primary aggressor in it's hard for the district attorney when either. That the right tell who it is. In without that witness or a statement from the suspect thing yeah I did this I did that. It's hard them to prosecute a lot of cases get the client. And as the wait wait is. Are we do have witnessed available like a child which is unfortunate but a off my child will be there a child will say what happened. A lot times this district attorney feels more comfortable we have a witness like that that says this is actually what happened. In a separate things out. In being an investigator. What I wanna say this that. You have to have some understanding and compassion these cases it's going to understanding what the female or male has been going through your dinner stand that they may have been married twenty years five years what are maybe. They may have children- this is not an easy thing for them to go through to separate all and they want to stay together and you. Will do the best a cation you last the victim male female. What do you want to now. Do want that person prosecuted for doing this the time. You're talking about a week later is the answer is no they don't. You have to understand why though in the reason being is because they're a is highly emotional. Feelings they have. Share bank accounts share mortgage. On their lan each other for to get by so. Something happens in often when a victim does not want prosecution anymore the district will not prosecute that case unless we have a good evidence or a victim that can see otherwise for us. Thank you. I'm just some statistics on average it takes a person seven times before they actually leave an abusive relationship so an officer's gonna respond many times this is the tenth time they've been to this house- and the increase of danger increases when that person leaves the relationship so within the first seventy two hours that a person leases on that their highest risk of being killed. So those all have to be taken into consideration as well if that person knows their partner better than anybody else they know the danger that they possibly can be and if they try to leave this situation- even if at the moment it might be the best situation the- danger really increases for them. Thank you any okay. I do want to add to what you just said I'm there on the for you know for the officers the one thing that has helped us having army there I have the first contact with the victim so when the Victor comes in sometimes obviously she doesn't want to talk to the officers so- I go ahead and set up an appointment with them. There's going to be times when she doesn't want to come in but I persist on the call right I you know tell them what I do I let them know that I'm not an officer but at that I'm here to help so one of the things that has helped us is that I never ask why are you still there because I know that it takes many years I was actually a victim of domestic violence it took me over ten years to actually get out. So I think that helps us there with the police department to have me there because again I've relate my re you know the past relations with the victims so I pretty much much know exactly what they're thinking that- half finance their own have somewhere to go there are afraid they're being threatened with the kids so one of the things that I always. I ate here their story and I actually went but I do. Tell them. Is I let them know that I was a victim. And that I did it not for myself for that I wasn't thinking about everybody else. But because I didn't want my I have two boys. And I don't want them to actually do the same to other females. So I kinda go in that direction where we have to help. And cut the circle kind of the cycle went to make sure that. They understand if they continue being those relationships. It's hard but they're just going to continue and their children will continue doing the same thing and accepting. In their lives. So that's what we do there. That's what's easier for us to go ahead and have that relationship with the victim. And then to that- comment or those the information. I want to ask in general because I know that- senator Rubio just- passed a bill about training- is there. And I'm don't want to put you on the spot is there. Some kind of a training- that assists- the law enforcement officers because- you know. It you're explaining all of this but it right away I'm thinking. What experience you know do you have. And you know are you treating this call. As you know just another call and that you know you did explain that it's very different. But I guess my own walk left already. He was there the trainer of some of those. At. Will work. Thank you and then to that question as well as you know what- do your cities have in place right now- in terms of support for the officers and- training- when assisting in these calls because I can't again I just can't imagine you know your blood is pumping in your adrenalin is pumping and having to answers to some of these calls not knowing if you're going to be a victim of the some something or you're gonna find already somebody sees I mean that would be my biggest fear is that when I write that you there's already people that have been. You know injured. Yeah we're very lucky to have Chen occurred our department because she's a good liaison to have with the with her experience and where she works- you know rather to jobs that she has. So but we there is specialized training that you know officers could get sent to as as- Mister Allen said earlier you know the academy there increasing your their hours there's a block is a forty hour block a plea for domestic violence- but it's great to have a liaison it you know ballpark of you know it you know. I'm sure week maybe we could do something regional. Where you know them sure not every please park and have that but- she's a regional resource. And you know just providing briefing trainings and talking officers that alone is beneficial she puts on formal training as well- she expand on that. Some of the training that you give up. As I've been able to do the briefings with officers provide those resources. When they'd go out on calls and there's victims and we have a direct link. Where they can call our twenty four hour helpline as well. And places victims into- the emergency shelter. That is the local shelter in the San Gabriel Valley area which is the wings shelter. Thank you and then so a follow up question- what barriers. Do you see our I mean I'm sure there's a many by the way. What are the top maybe one or two barriers that you see- in. Assisting or serving domestic violence victims. I know money is part of it but. If we aye what are the biggest barriers anything. I think for us a ballpark I think it's all the time I we do I think I S. we both do different in a way where different nam hats there in the city so it's a little bit hard but I think one of the things is all the training. For us I think within often this out enough but as far as barriers I mean it's just more of the time in the funding for the departments. Thank you and then. So barriers for the- victims well and you providing services for the victims. I think one of the biggest things is just like you mentioned working with the kids and helping to build that prevention piece and working with the entire family so we really try to provide education- to the community as well as- helping to teach people what a healthy relationship looks like so that that cycle stocks because it is a learned behavior. Thank you and then- one last question- because I think- this is our last- domestic violence hearing of the ear so this is our fourth line and what I also have been- hoping to address is the LGBTQ community because I know all- being in Mexican- you know being of Mexican. Just facts a whole nother level of barriers if you well you know our our communities don't necessarily accept LGBT Q. no kids and so I feel like. And as a school board member I also saw then specially in middle school some of those kids- bore suicidal- and then they got involved in relationships that were not healthy and they continue to get the views because they didn't feel comfortable coming out to their parents or you know whatever- what have you a whole bunch of. Of more more issues to the LG to be a kid community because you know if women and men are. Ashamed of speaking out I am trying to get help for domestic violence I know the deal to Q. community also as you know and is more- prevalent especially in Latino communities and I am from ballpark so when I was a little bit board member involved in park I thought that. Was a big issue is there any you know anything else that we can do a visual. Train any partners just what the hell to up. Community that we think we can help with raging so that you all have the resources for that particular community as well. I think one of the a good idea that I think would be good is actually trying to get into the school districts like the actual high school's. Junior highs because we actually see this happening at a younger age I know that for a fact so I think if we were to partner up with the school districts and start there. In you know bring some of these programs and talk about it I mean the talk about everything else might as well start talking about the- the teen dating out the violence behind it- and then you know adding more of the other stuff information that students need to know. Perfect domestic violence affects everyone so it's no gender- and really it's about building an inclusive community so where everyone feel safe to reach out for resources and letting them know where they're at so with the officers they're able to provide resources when they go out on phone I mean out on calls that were able to give out numbers so that whoever it is in the community that's being affected has a place where they can call when they're ready. Thank you. Any other comments that you think- should hear about. Yeah I think I think it's just report as Walter mine officers is not always he said she said anymore you know it's you could have been done if anybody's just remember like eight but he could be a victim- you know when we're going to calls and you see two males are two females. It's not a battery it's a domestic violence yet this that was that relationship. And that's the and I'm time I like the dating relationship yes absolutely ship as well as- a builder for. Now someone might you know they might have some intuitions about officers and we might you know not. Be sure of what we're dealing with exactly so- again training- and just and you asked earlier about some of the. The is like the- the problems are the trump some of the troubles was earlier question. What the barriers there- and a lot and a lot of it is cooperation victim cooperation it's hard to get a to get to get a victim to cooperate because you might you know a month later they may be back with that person and they don't want anything done and then it kind of puts you know the law enforcement and the judicial system out of. At a standstill so to say. Wiseman and- that's our whole other topic but you know the- social media- bullying and- stocking and I. Really is. I'm also domestic violence even though it's been there's no physical interaction and I just social media brings a whole nother level of. Of I wish I love it but I hate it at the same time because I see a lot you know even within my own- friends and I'm- barred from the leading people because I'm a state of officials I can't delete folks but I see some of the things they post and it's- it just makes me cringe. Because where you are modeling for kids really you know some of these folks that that start posting no inappropriate content an appropriate on pictures you know they think it's no big deal by they don't. You don't realize that their kids are watching our kids are watching and you know it also adds another layer of a of abuse and sell but that'll be for another conversation because I think we can pull up a whole other on. Day on bills to sit that specific issues so I just want to thank you for providing your your comments and not thank you for the work that you do and again I want to be a partner with you and I know that- senator Susan would be as office. No were. Were excuse me for both. To ensure that we make some kind of headway- with domestic violence I think. You know I wish I can say that we can- completely. I'll get rid of it but the unfortunate- part is that we know that we can sell- anyway would thank you very much- and you know. Hopefully you'll be around for questions. The other thing that I found in my previous- meetings that some folks that that may be here. That have questions or not. I'm going to ask in public so please be if you can make yourself available for anybody. We need to be sources or just somebody to talk to I really would appreciate. Thank you very much. Kill him then so next. Our next panel. Is our local rest are resources available to survivors and their families and we have today we have severe Rodriguez. Senior manager of family services YWCA of Central Valley. We also have Angela- air community advocate center for the- Pacific Asian family- doctor Rebekah guys- director of programming and lead psychologist back- Becky's angels international. If you can join us on the panel I'd- appreciate it and just. To give you a little bit of background the last three- hearings have dealt with. Issues such as- culturally appropriate hello because a lot of folks I depending on their culture believe that you know you keep your dirty laundry. On behind closed doors- some folks are taught at an early age that you do not reveal you do not talk about you just think it because that's your duty and so hopefully we can address some of those- issues- if you ladies today so thank you for being here a few control. Yourself. Family. And I to quiet the- yeah so Angela air I'm one of the community advocates at center for the pensions of the Civic Asian farming skews me. Hi my name is Sophia Rodriguez on the senior manager of family services at the YWCA of sank able values domestic violence program I'm also marriage and family therapist there. Thank you and if you would like to start you know if you have any comments are or we can you know ask I can ask him questions that I did a lot of police officers- whatever you're more comfortable with because I know that- your you've done a lot of work in this field and so if you maybe start by sharing a little bit about what your background is and what- how use of- domestic violence. Victims. At the White easier thank April Valley we have to programs in our domestic violence. Inside we have our residential program which includes domestic violence shelter- within our domestic violence shelter we have emergency and transitional housing. And in our non residential we are sixteen weeks support group as well as our community education program. In the last year we've served over one thousand individuals who are experiencing domestic violence and this includes children. And then- similar to what wings does in our program we specifically focus on the Asian Pacific Islander AB and community in regards to domestic violence and sexual assault services- we have the only emergency shelter in southern California that specifically focuses on this population including language capacity. And then we- offer to of read transitional shelter programs on that Sir about population and- to address some of the questions that you had brought up earlier one of the issues that we find is that there is a huge lack of language services- and because of that- because a lot of our clients that we serve for immigrants as well- they're- able or unwilling to access. On the services. That we provide for working on trying to. So I have a little bit of a different agenda- almost city sorry from my age. I'm I had one two and three that I wanted to cover would that be okay absolutely okay so first of all it's an honor to meet you thank you for the invitation. This last minute I'm so grateful to be here. The first thing I wanted to talk about was a little bit about my story and why I'm here- I actually was- well I am an immigrant from Mexico I came here at age nine. And. Had suffered a lot of experience a lot of domestic violence my own parents- we were in Chicago. And my mother my father in this you know I. Say about the male victim truly believe in the male victim my father was the male victim. I only got four years of. Interaction my father but it takes one parent. To raise a stable person a stable child and I hope that I'm semi stable. In a reflection of those four years that I had but so my mother kidnapped us and brought us here to California- I don't want to get too deep into the story but just a little bit about why I'm here because I think it has substance- I came here at age. Twelve to California- with my mother and eighty four month old brother- my mother had a lot of issues TV multi provisional pattern for us well- in left me- here as a child so I became a mom at twelve years old of a four month old baby and I struggled I live the streets. Up is being from DCFS I and I say I have substance because I want to get into when I get into the resources and my request for resources- so I actually survived- out in the street basically I work seven days a week I went to school I hid from the system. I had you know my cheese also neighbors that helped me- Reyes brother sometimes they are you know they're a great resource to you are in so with that at age fourteen ended up with- in high school with my abuser so. I ended up and he I was in the V. for twenty six years with my abuser and I can tell you the in and out of Y. victim stay and I fell up some framework around that that work- I recall being a child in sitting in a corner. Of covering my ears and telling myself that I was never going to be anything. In life and I had no hope for life. Then I re experience that in my own TV. I remember- living with my abuser is sitting in a bathroom corner by the toilet saying just. I want in my life you know but I guess I didn't have enough courage to do that. Or I had my brother to take care of. So having said that the second thing that I want to talk about is how- it make his angels got established- I actually went to school- during my TV. And I was hiding to go to school supposedly I was working in but I was actually going to school behind the scenes so that my abuser would not find out. I lived a lot of terror in that relationship. But is strengthened me and that's reason why I'm here- I ended up leaving my abuser after twenty six years. And I give all the credit. To officer Gus was sitting in the back. Always here supporting me all over there he moved. He actually after I left my abuser I met him. And he is the person that Tami whether true love less about and what a healthy relationship less about he the person that protected for my abuser. And we ended up getting married for a year but in all the hopping from one relationship to the other which a lot of TV victims do doesn't work out but we love each other like. Family. He's always there to support me and- you know he he will be he will be what made me who I am today. Because of that I decided I want to go back to school so I went and got my a Sadie in France a clinical psychology because I wanted to work with the victims. So in my internship I wanted to understand the perpetrator. And what I did is I actually did my first internship là AB one day where the twin palms. I discovered a lot I discovered that they are also victims and I really appreciate what you said earlier about not addressing the aggressor they are victims but I feel that there is chemical issues involved with the aggression peace. And that is why the aggressor is the aggressor I'm in so Becky saying gills came about on my second internship I decided that- to put together based on my own reflection framework. The framework is that if I knew my legal rights. I would have gotten out wait earlier. I the second thing would be therapy how do I deal with my past traumas and stay grounded in stable in the third piece is formal education because I it I am a former I am a an educator I am actually a college professor full and so everything that I do is donated time- with back his angels. And I felt that having that education is what really save my life and that of my children because I see that they are breaking the cycle of violence. So in terms of support- I am here to say that one of the biggest disappointments working out in the community is a lot of competitiveness among agency rather than- being United and not talking about this area I'm talking about I do a lot of work in LA. And so my mission is to move out here because I hear that there's a scarce you know the resource are very scarce on here it is something this is where my heart started in a hope to move out here secondly everything that I do with Becky's angels is out of pocket and is extremely difficult and stressful and I have to tell you just two weeks ago I wanted to close down the clinic because I am tired. I haven't funding I have a child in college- you know to write grants I'm the only one that does all this work on my own. And so my phone is constantly blowing up. Third thing is one of my missions is to get together with different agencies to put victims first and not funding to that's one of the things that I discover. Like I said it was a huge disappointment that's white- I'm working you know where I'm working in so to put together a group of agencies within their reach and- to get together at least once a month to discuss. Best practices for the area best practices how we can share sources to help are victims in our community. Lastly I get disappointed every October because this is the second awareness meeting that I at ten- related to domestic violence. We're not out in the spotlight in October and I know that cancer month it that's also important but if you look at stats. D. V. dads are higher. Dodd then people die from cancer breast cancer. And so what does that tell you we need more awareness in our community we need more support and it takes you guys to bring that the know that support- there was something else I wanted to share. Add Becky singles how that god created us in my second internship- I did I put my for work I develop curriculum around it a lot of what the officer set is collaboration with the PD I can connect with everything each person said at this table in the first panel. Because that's what it takes it takes collaborative work between PD and are agencies as well as the community- one of the things that I discover is- the officer talked about the CFS. I deal with most of the DCFS cases where the children are removed because the victim was in TV that's such a punitive system the children go to date go to foster care because I work with them all the way into reunification. And they come back for someone they left there's something wrong with the system and I went through that myself so I know first hand- the second thing that has been extremely helpful and I've been managing to kind of keep a float in LA. Is a one stop center what does that mean when the victim- and the children get removed the victim goes to court is having an advocate like the lady that was here and this and- to talk to the victim to will testify to hop in bed processes because the dark very dark tunnels call it a- whole this lonely. For I and you have no one by your side if I would have somebody like her I would done wonders. But I did and I had to do everything by myself was all he was a support. The one steps their children- cord will may take the individual. To prevent losing their job they go there and they get all the resources in one day. They learn they collaborate with other people they become friends and they help each other as a community so I am hoping that. You support me what that are support us and I'm hoping to mean more than seize in this area and that I'm welcome in this area because I. Everything I do is doesn't I'm not looking for money I'm looking for work and I'm looking for results. Thank you. Thank you thank you for your story- you know and- it's true that you know we all walk- and talk to people and have no idea what they've gone through or what they're going through right now. Once I really appreciate you opening up- or story- but it up and it also makes as reflect again on the- services that are not provided and one of the issues that I mentioned earlier. You know how point is language. Appropriate resources because. In this area for example you know we have- a Spanish is the primary language but I commute back and forth from San Diego on a we have a big. Ending community care and so that that- we are the need for a different language there is very different than it is in. The center valley and soul can you maybe speak on on what you are all doing to provide those language services and- are you even able to meet the demand- for those language- services. Sure so- firstly thank you for pointing that out one of the biggest issues and that we do find is that- cam with language. If I am an immigrant individual of English is not my primary language. I'm afraid to speak out because I don't know what my resources are I don't know if I go to DCFS office if. By exposing myself- and giving information about my abusive partner whoever they may be. If I may be detained or deported that kind of thing. And a lot of- API. Survivors of domestic violence and sexual stole. Personally because of the cultural stick marketing our dirty laundry but again because of that fear that they're going to get out it they don't know the resources are there. So what seat half the agent's cam phone was trying to accomplish is- providing that kind of intermediary a service where we can help them navigate the systems that we have here in California in language- this includes things like going to DC fast going to court- children supervision accompaniments- we also do- start a company. So sexual. Assault response team like when he. I individuals at the Medical Center getting the exam done we are there to offer emotional support and kind of guide them through that process- one of our issues is that we are primarily based on create town that's where a community center is. But as I think everyone here probably is aware of so many Asian folks are out here in the same people Valley. And in fact a lot of our- survivors that come to us through a hotline or calling from here. And the problem with that is that some of them maybe to drive- some are fearful to do so. Traffic is awful- so what we're trying to do is as you were mentioning as well- partner more with- individuals and agencies in this area to. Choose firework farther east work because that's definitely where the need is- we have done quite a bit of- recently preventative work with API youth. In think Iran all hambre on in this is to hold break a whole culture of violence thing- so things like TV in the home- teen dating violence. What we're wanting to spread our case management and counseling mental health TV services for on this area. So we're hoping that. You know interested parties will come reach out connect. Question so when you're talking about- you know collaboration do you guys- have you know kind of a system where you see a you know I can call. And see if she they can help me with this language that we don't I mean if there. Is it just you guys are doing in a reserve some kind of a central I mean I have no idea so that's why I'm asking because it just seems like. You know if you can provide some of those- last systems in that language that you know some of the other agencies can benefit from your resources. To be able to help folks navigate in their own language so- one of the great things about our program not not to like puff it up or anything is that you should you should. Absolutely that's why we're here. I think you it's we have a twenty four hour hotline. And we have a team of about forty folks right now we're very small- but the most of a speak a secondary. Language so when someone calls if the council. On the hotline does speak that language we can connect with a staff member that does. If that's offer may not be available we also have a look like a huge volunteers speak various languages and me. Connect to different services that can provide an interpreter over the phone. And so I think they mean that I mean it makes it. More accessible even if it's just to inform the survivor of research- and I think role it is you know when you call us. You don't have to leave right now. Sometimes it's impossible. And we have the safety number. Makes so much more welcoming and- how little to even discuss TV in the first place. You know I am sure that the majority of the constituency that I represent its primary Spanish or Hispanic and- do you have any of the issues that that the Latino immigrant community has I have experience with some folks that. Know the mother wouldn't leave because the father was like you know if you leave I'm gonna report to all to immigration and in I'm gonna get you departed and so that constant fear. Also as a you know obviously a barrier by but I don't want to assume because I think you know what we talk about with all of the right we all this team that that the immigration issues is papered on aids is mainly for the I Latino Hispanic community. But I would like if you share the issues that you will run into in terms of- immigration and you know being threatened- for their immigration status as well because again we all seem to think that it's just a lot in the community that's going to this but I want. You know- acknowledge that it's not just that but the community so if you can address or not sure of your experience in that area sure I mean definitely. In in the entry media it it there's a huge focus on the Latino community in the immigration issue. But definitely I think just historically throughout the years with the A. K. community- so many of us coming in. But sometimes it happens sure I and whatever- but when they get to the states- if they're within the beast a partner who is a citizen or- someone who has some form of status. Or or not even- they're constantly getting the threat of. If you do X. Y. Z. I'm gonna call the police and they're going to arrest you in the many arrested again get deported- you have no access to services out here because you don't have status. It's a very very common feared I think a lot of our clients have. So actually most of my survivors a common in house to our shelter programs. In fact. Almost all of them have immigration issues that we have to sort through. Whether that's getting- their own visa going through the green card process accessing- status through Volos of violence against women act. Because they have to separate their own immigration case from their abusive partner. And then our runner solo- and then we have quite a few Israelis as well- they fled their home country and then they came here and then. You know more stuff happened. On so. Choose to return your question it's very very prevalent. I can actually. Thank you thank you for that. At the White ABC of San Gabriel Valley we never deny anybody based on language we've been very creative in how we're able to provide all the services that we offer to any client regardless of the language- anything from bringing in interpreters we- also use the language line. That is this with our crisis twenty four hour hotline- in addition we have worked with other agencies- to be able to provide our clients the services. I didn't want to touch on something that you mentioned and that was- the need. For funding for services for clients oftentimes DCFS does require. Individual counseling parenting domestic violence services and although all of our services are free we found it really difficult to connect our clients with individual casting and parenting that is free. And especially if they are leaving their home and the- are already trying to figure out housing. Then it makes it really difficult to play an out of pocket for the services so I did want to touch back on them. Thank you for that- if I may. First I want to see thank you see Pat is wonderful I have worked with you guys- in LA- and I don't know for. Me personally I feel. Competent enough culturally to be able to serve- you know like the Asian Pacific- community so we do do a lot of work and they're very responsive so I wanted to publicly thank him for that because I had a case. Not too long ago where I was and I think it was that LA community- hospital. And the victim had just gotten here and same thing exactly what you said and I made a call. And then they came right to the hospital they took over. Of for me personally what we do because I can't stretch out I mean very stressed out already. Is I let them know that I rather you know. That transform over to a place where they're going to understand their needs more but I'm not going to leave them. And I remember this client holding my hands couldn't make it with me. But she believe me you know I wasn't gonna leave until someone came. And just the happened over was like a big deal for her because she felt that safety piece. Thank you so much thank here your administrators for the nice work that you guys do in. LA and I'm really hoping that they get reported out here. Thank you all and in terms of funds you know it's always a battle and- Sacramento with the budget and- but I do think that there's other ways that we can support- I. Hope we have some some local grant writers that work for cities and school districts all you know I want to ask them to do. Pro bono the eat you know how grant writing arts eventually they get paid. Based on the grounds that they receive except for what they do in cities and in school districts as they get a monthly retainer for that. So there's one in particular that I want to- kind of talk to see if they're willing to at least do that I'm pro bono and then they can get paid based on the on the grounds that they received because I think. You know even- at the state level last year- senator bell and I were eight. Six twenty million dollars for domestic violence right and then because it was a big. Issue well apparently it wasn't that big of issue this time we only got forty five. Thousand dollars think about that forty five thousand for the whole state. Forty five thousand for the whole state and so is sold the battle begins again. I thought I'd Hey we got twenty million you know we were going to keep getting this funding. Well lo and behold you know that was on a per eighty this year so it was forty five thousand dollars. So the fight begins and luckily for me I have now another- ally in the Senate- that we can. Collaborate with to try and get and the these grants right through. The department of emergency services- backed- organizations such as yours cam can access by forty five thousand dollars is not gonna get you anything- bites- I'm going to need you again next year on the fender and I and- us and Rubio havoc- committed to. To making that budget ask again it's a long process. And it's basically it's like you know a cracks you know you throw that if any hope that the lands on where you want it to be. But in the meantime I do want to connect you with some of these local fund a- grant writers. And all make the page and ask them to do. You know something at and help you with some of these grant writing- because I know even writing a grant is just. You know hours and hours of work in research. And so I please commit to that I'm committing to having a budget ask a follow up here. And hopefully we can you know keep make. Asking your to the point where they could they- not. Leave them open and up to one. Point five. Those who have. Hold on community- baby in reality it is and it's a it's a you know. A California problem- and- through the work that I was doing I also found that- domestic violence if we want to talk about budget- costs. Millions and millions of dollars that if we put invested in the prevention and the support. We would be able to not spend but that's a whole again. You know that conversation. Goals kind of. Out of sight out of mind with some of these folks because they they- look at. You know budgetary- priorities like. Parks which are important but- you know. Sometimes we have to balance that can I add something now that you mention parks. One of the biggest- pieces for me facility. I started LGBT open their doors- to. In groups there and I a no I don't in my time. I have on an average of thirty to forty people. Upper group we need every Saturday. And part of that work is because I was so terrified. The police. When they can feel comfortable they make the police their friends you know they start collaborating- in every cities region in those types of resources so for me ideally my dream would be to have all of us in one building when we can just say Hey who can serve this victim. Thank you thank you that- that is a great goal and hopefully we can get to that point so I want to thank you again for participating and you know again you die if you make yourself available for folks and you know if they need help or you know just resources are connecting get to know each other at some point you can collaborate and you know how- and a couple years can have this will stay where control in what like. They did so thank you for your participation thank you. Thank you and then our third panel- we have- we're going to spotlight on local LGBT Q. plus. Resources and- de stigmatizing- domestic violence- today we have Serra Acevedo board members and uber valley LGBT Q. center. Deanna Herrera victims advocate St John's transgender health programs- Sophia Rodriguez senior managers manager of family services at. The YWCA of Sanger bro Bally will continue- with us on the panel- if you can take a seat and please introduce yourself and- let us know a little bit about your background- so that we can not continue with the conversation. Hi my name is Sarah seven though I am a board member of the think able Valley LGBT Q. center and also the secretary of the board and the director of programs there. Hello my name is Tanner Herrera and I work for St John's for one of the biggest transcend help programs in the nation a worldwide. And I'm also part of that- transgender advisory board counts for the city of Los Angeles. In the voice of five million people and I also work with LAPD LGBT working group. Hello as I introduced myself earlier one of the things I did want to mention is that all of our services at the White AB CA are. On inclusive to all genders. Thank you. Arm well I just wanted to address that. St John's onscreen providing healthcare to the public for over fifty years- the started from the basement of the cathedral and Adams in flower. Of Serbian the- minorities who are especially on document it so from there- that's where they started and then within time we expanded to sixteen clinics. So now our focus the mission of the Johns are focused seen on serving Donna. Some of Los Angeles in any part of. Of the U. S. because not only when we started our transgender health program. Which was five years ago we started with eight patients a transgender patients within the period of. Five years we have expanded to serving two thousand five hundred trans gender. And through our transgender health program not only do we offer a hormone replacement therapy we offer meant mental health. And we also focus on the public because the chances of AB papers clinic and we also serve the undocumented population say they don't have any health insurance or or anything at all- they would not be discriminated or turn down based on color race religion or gender- everybody will be seen. And if you have private insurance or if you have medi cal or Medicare that's a plus because to our transgender help program. Our patients one of the being patient of ours for about a year not only do they qualify for gender dysphoria surgeries- that the medi cal or the private insurance. Will cover and that's reason why would he have our therapist in our clinicians because he comes out of our clinic so. Our clinicians they need to know there are patients are mentally stable in order to we see whatever perjury that they're seeking because there's certain surgeries that they just cannot be reverts. So through that once they're done with their therapy they submit the referrals and they're ready to go and not only do we have. Our wonderful staff but we also have our victims advocate program specifically for our trans individuals we have been victims of hate crime for suspects were human trafficking and torture and domestic violence. Me my thought hasn't avocat- the working for seen. John place are working there thousand Eckstine September eleven. What's the big myself. Of hate crimes and once not twice but three times so based on that of putting myself out there. Of survive means- doing to sex work even though I do have a high school diploma have higher college education. It was very difficult for me to get a job or to be employed for the simple fact of just being who I am being a trans woman of color. So things to think John's opened up a lot of doors a lot of players for myself. To advocate not only for my community but also advocating for the public and for the undocumented- as an immigrant. I focus on the public because it wouldn't be right for me just. The focus on the LGBT community N. are victims advocate program. One of my coworkers which is no the cruise. He's our new with avocat that he's Charlene and he's willing to learn as much as- not only for all but the rest of the team. En us we connect them with whatever it is that they're speaking- not only to mental health health care. And whatever it is that the need to go. To the right date. Of what they're looking for and throughout. Our program we also have our Neiman Marcus James which we help our transit individuals. I'm to make their lives but- changed their name and mark on. Their driver's license in California ease in all. Our transit parliament program which helps our patients. Excuse me on how to create the resume needs are job interviews and how to behave ed themselves in a professional work environment and what they completed all. Of the big. An opportunity where they would not be given the who they are. And on top of that we also have our dental which is open and available for everyone so if example if we have an undocumented patient the house no kind of on employment history or whatever it is that they're doing to make the ends meet they call based. On their income so is there on a human it is likely they will qualify for my health LA which is- it'll cover health care mental in dental. And medication and if it's a surgery that it's medically necessary. It can also be covered as long as as their provider- does the refer all. And based on that- I've learned to grow so much through the thing John not only that they empowered me but- I was one of their first patients and employee who has gone. The majority of- gender dysphoria surgeries. Approved in other words I have opened up a lot of doors for our transit leans who are seeking- third and surgeries. And through my advocacy- able to advocate more through the transgender advisory board counsel for the city of Los Angeles being a voice for five million people and also in collaboration with the LAPD IGBT working group. Because my passion to me is advocating for my community and through my higher education. I just wanted a simple degree which with my associates in corrections well corrections the transfer. But I was able to check for. You make jokes of course is in with able to get. My that's my associates my pastors and could not just is not working on my masters in behavior science. Thank you so much- for the act and to that- you one of have I do you have any comments or anything that you would like us to. Know and then I'll ask a couple questions as well say- so just some quick history on the center valley LGBTQ center we've been around since twenty eleven- started Pasadena as the Pasadena pride center. And we started simply with your support groups and during those work groups we discovered that there were many many underlining issues that each of us face- as LGBT Q. people kind of set up more interceptions than most people. So we get a lot of people of different races different ethnicities different classes- we didn't get some survivors a DP- IPV on is a part of our current events- we don't get a lot of them because we don't have. A fake are programs that service those people because we are entirely volunteer based CA. Everyone that works all of our board members nobody is paid we're all their optical and here basis- so a lot of the work we do is. In addition to our regular jobs- and don't have a permit. Space right now we partner with the. Arcadia you see see. Around seventy demos Tunis and they have a they own historical mansion and so we operate out of that during our- hours are the only times. That we are open we don't have walking hours but we do have- Google voice number which is our phone. And anyone can call anytime and we have received TV calls IBV calls and we do you refer them to the LA LGBT centre. But I've gained so much our knowledge today. So I'm so happy that I can- refer them to other people. It might be close there are might be more willing to help very. Interested in helping- some of the things we deal with are mostly about accessibility- so we often find. That people are worried about the legal definitions of domestic violence. The violence that has been perpetrated upon them. The considered sick Rylance they're worried about being outed to their family or to their employer- there are a lot. Of survivors so many people do not talk about it that are LGBT Q. they are survivors of TV IPV. And often times. Women in particular on face higher DV and IV V. and they are instances of death- so they're not a lot of survivors and even in instances like- last April- twenty eighteen. Lease teenage couple and a money California- they had an instance of DVD and one of them instead of the other to death. And there was another incident it's not far from there care where it is right now but another it was another gay couple and one of them was killed in the altercation. And so that kind of ship the community and thereof approached us and asked us to give more- programs on those sorts of things so right now we have up your support groups. Are per support groups are. Have a game night which is considered a pre support group- it's for all people under the LGBT Q. umbrella we have. A non binary your support group a grief. Your support group a transcript of workgroup. And amends for support group in a women's for support group- so right now the mostly focus on like meeting together and going through like a grieving process other. We also have like from those- the people that have grown and have. Got what they need they needed to get out of our per support programs. They started social groups and so they're able to connect with the community and that's really what we as- a kid like a community center there. Thank you in- I'm going to ask on the same question any additional barriers aside from many because we all know that that's the number one- barrier for us to be able to support by what other barriers- or state my are facing the LGBT. Community I know we talked a little bit about you know just a culturally- it's you know it's a stigma just in itself but what other- issues do you see that are facing the LGBT. One of the barriers that we've- recently for and was that a lot of the programs are located in. The city of Los Angeles- as being in the San Gabriel Valley and- a lot of our clients do not have transportation and that's a barrier. On it's very difficult for them to access a lot of the I'm services that would specialized with the LGBT Q. Q. plus community. And so- for us specifically we are always looking to branch out and act I know that we have- with. Some of the agencies locally but- when we look. Thank you for. Today all this is a- close down- it it's difficult when. It's not local if it's an ongoing service such as mental health services that would be for example weekly appointment and every week the client would have to figure out how to get and if it's in the middle the Los Angeles it is a commute from here. Thank you. Also a lot of the barriers not only that we face. Through the RGB TQ it's a lot of homelessness. Specifically the trans women because once- before their transition or what the this type of transition when they come out to their parents and tell them- this is the way I feel. I'm now G. B. T. or K. or transitioning what are they doing instead of being support at what they do they throw money to the street. At a younger age in nowadays the trans coming up younger younger so what we need to do is try to educate the parents. Because not only by throwing their children into the street that could lead to more trauma drugs. Sex work. And incarcerations and on top of that. For education so not only are they being bullied through school but. They have to do what they have to do in order to survive and the next thing you know they wind up in in jail and imprisoned in there. Nothing out there so what I ask is this how to do something to educate the parents. To learn how to stand by their siblings. Because that that's the reason why there's a lot of homelessness within the LGBT community. And also along. This try to work on funding to empower. Not only is specifically the kinds community. Hello also a lot of the LGBTQ communities. Because for employment. Because a lot of people does not a lot of places I'm sorry a lot employers does not want to hire. LGBT Q. or trans community just because. Trance our community members they have higher education degrees but was holding them back it's- just be who they are and they have all the qualifications. That's what I advocate a lot and- working with the transgender advisory board. We focus on and a lot of the challenges that the community our face the and in one of them is the homelessness and employment. Well thank you very much if you have any additional comments but I the competition is important again you know we talked about- language barriers and in this case we're talking about just barriers you know just the mobile- barriers and I completely understand that was- why made that comment earlier about you know the Latino Hispanic community- if you will come out you know the first thing. Is disown you and you know as a parent I have a twelve year old and in the world and I always wonder how is that I can love my children so much. Like when they were born I just love them so much bye bye- the minute you say something like I a M. you know. Transgender out to be two then all of a sudden you the supplement it never on the. Ballot I think the vision for the. Because they're still your children. Now I am again. As a mom you know I'm speaking as a mother because I cannot see how I can love them so much and then they- tell me something I don't want to hear. And then can disown a child so the education for parents I think it's important but you know of course. We can only do so much of the services for the LGBTQ community- is there are important and I. Also one to- acknowledge that the home. This issue because I do see that a lot- for LG Q. teens not Mister the adults that teens are the ones that can't find. Homes are couch surfing and never mind trying to find employment- so there's at age fighting between thanks there's some statistics between the ages of. Somewhere like around thirteen fourteen to eighteen that they don't really feel supported- by any of our programs and so I think we need to do more to try and address those issues- with the kids and so hopefully we can- start- ask. For some help with the tools arms up. Education and incorporate you know because we're talking about because you're right I'm a lot of the issues- are. Different but at the end of the day- you know of being a sex workers also it's- is by land right and so. They get beat up so it may not be intimate partner and the sense of relationships but it's still- being abused- because they have no other choices all- I want to thank you for that- at this point I will. Open it up if anybody. Wants. To come state. I really would appreciate it. When we can I am not been talk from there. Can I speak on yes absolutely. Down with our parent education is that it's often nine that line next people when I feel and that's I mean let you know that the now but the exes- gender neutral marker so it's not that the Lennox community is. More homophobic another communities I don't I don't want that to be like a source of confusion- there is a huge clear line X. community and they're very open and they're very welcoming- it's just that a lot of times Lennix people tend to be very religious and religion is very hopeful. Right I'm- not necessary early. Next makes them more home. As for the five take. It just so happens that that's kind of the way it turns right we find many many line experience that are. So willing and- one hundred percent. Into are you supporting their children when they come to our youth groups right when I think thank you for clarification I think that is true. And now we have. There is light- father Michael Griffin Johnson Baldwin park that is very open to supporting- communities he doesn't care about you know what date and finance and he sees. Our people as people and I think that that message needs to get across that no matter what it is or who you you you are- the support as- well needed and we're still human beings and I. I wanna send shot out to father Mike because he he has partner I'm not only with- the city of bottom park but with all of us. In to. Be open about- that he truly believe that we're all children of god and it doesn't matter you know what we identify it god if. We believe in god that and we're supposed to be supporting. Each other but thank you the clarification. Any. Yes also monitor share on part of my story and I could I totally- connect with which is that earlier about- is Tony I've been this inherit it and also based on what she said based on religion- to begin with- my mother- I transition at the age of six sixteen years old. US of a topic graduated from high school I was over the limit of the trans gender male nature on. The one and by the way. And my era was the eighties so the eighties era was very difficult not only at the aids epidemic- I did want to have to do to survive not only based on my education but then could not in I guess I was blessed. That even though I did. A lot of sex work that's why advocate a lot of it because I've been there I walked in their shoes. And I know what it's like to be in their shoes- not only what they have become a hate crime but they've got that on your- neck. Update all the years I've started doing that. I was also an escort for over ten years I did what I have to do to you to make my aunt's me I travel to the whole United States making a lot of money I'm would deny what I did because- being. And I'm not ashamed of it because. Doing the things that I did in the past. That's what makes me the person that I am now. To advocate and to look. For my community or my other siblings and. And like when my father passed away in the year two thousand I already knew he passed away a belt hammer thing partners is disease so through that. One wasn't able to recognize why was I realized that I lost my father. And my father loved to meet my father never laid a hand that me on the contrary he encouraged me to get higher education. Because he said I already know the path you're heading so I advise you to try to get as much education as you can because that's the only in this one empower you and left you. Because the government can take your material things the way you might wind up in chaplain president xterra but one thing they can. Never take away from you is your knowledge. And through that I was blessed to live in and to have a father like that and once he passed away right away I really knew was going to inherit it in my mother disinherited means not only for the simple fact of being why am. And learned to improper myself and like I told her you live your life I live my life I won lift my truth we only live one. And. It's up to you but if you accept that or a- get but I'm not going to be miserable while you being happy. So with that we just live my truth and just let me be white one. So and also on top of that- we had a very wonderful successful program. That was funded by the federal government which is found for grant which was one of our biggest grant. Fourteen Johnson are seeking safety pro. And they're seeking safety program. It was supposed to be for three years we started late but within the two years that we have that program we named it project work have you E. R. K. which it stands for working in power it resilient and knowledgeable. And it was only for transgender women of color if we have been living in or experiencing trauma high risk for HIV and aids and drug and alcohol abuse. I raise the bar as the FAP because a lot of organizations we have had. Grant in that program. A three year grant they were able to. Get twenty thirty individuals to finish and graduate program. I raise the bar and I had over two hundred individuals graduate my congratulations. And after they would graduate from my program not only with the receipt a certificate. And a certificate. Opened up employment opportunities for a lot of mine. Graduates for HIV and aids counselling and role in all. And en even though a lot of them were undocumented and the successfully completed at they were able to use that to get political five. Thank you. Thank you and with that dumb if there's no other questions or comments- I want to thank you again for your participation in really- hopefully we can- do what we talked about as being more awareness to domestic violence yes. Such. I guess some detective Paula and so it it officer Rodriguez I am maybe I got a little lost so. Domestic abuse is that considered. Demeanor a felony I got a little lost with the terminology I'm sorry. Well I can try and- help but it depends on the on the fence and officer gas. Please I'm sorry. The difference there's two differences of misdemeanors where there is no visible injuries and up Allen is where there is visible injuries so the that's what differentiates those. That's basically it. Okay They have a cell phone. People are. Well. The mystic violence Los okay. Thank you and thank you for that question because it is important to- add to differentiate and I think- I officer how may have mentioned that sometimes you know the person that bad instigates the fight doesn't necessarily always become- the person that- is held responsible because you know obviously we all are no. That some of these relationships they knew which by as to push and so they start instigating so that they can get some reaction and that's how people get in trouble. But I think you know the fact is that they've been doing this for a while at this not the first offense and as as you stated that he not ex what times said before somebody actually decides to leave cell throw those are those both times they may be you know a few years it may be twenty something you before the- the fact is that you already know how to get to them and the dynamics have already been built. You instigate- in order to get you know whatever reaction so I think important- in terms of detectors five posted this on my Facebook page are. Fast so you by check on some file on this server. No Sir I. The for posting it is- somebody on my pages saying that I'm only focusing. I'm victims what about those that have been falsely accused now I I'm not going to respond because it'll be a long little conversation- but I think the problem is that- yes there there are instances of you know accusing. Others and not necessarily having enough evidence to prosecute but the fact of the matter is that I need to we need to focus on on what's happening now the statistics are are. Overwhelming that we have so many people that are victims of domestic violence at all as you know the victims have abusers and so there's Tom on both sides it's not just the domestic violence victim but the abuser the aggressor also has to aye and so we're dealing. Is that we get a handle on letter don't try to. Figure out who's being accused of falsely etcetera etcetera so you know there's only so much that we are capable of doing but what they did I'm made it a night I'm sure it does- senator Susan ruby is also committed to trying to at least make. Some make some headway and assist programs. I'm hoping that. Where where is the- believe transit into getting more more funding from the state so again I want to thank you for your participation if you have any other questions my staff is available I'm available but the folks are here with resources are available to at minimum exchange cards so that we on the that can leave here and know who to call if we need something which is a sense or whatever it may be. So thank you again for partisan in again thank you the to the city of Covina for hosting us and- I think we will- go ahead- see- yes so we have a resource for outside- you know we have some some of the folks that are providing some resources but other than thank you again and looks. Continuing the chin and again once we legislative. Because of you. To help me. I'm will be an option and if we can.
