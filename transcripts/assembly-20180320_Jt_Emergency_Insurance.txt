ALL TO OUR JOINT HEARING. OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE. I AM THE CHAIR OF THE OF LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HANNAH BETH JACKSON. I AM THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NINETEENTH SENATE DISTRICT. SOME OF YOU MAY BE AWARE OF IT IT'S ALL OF THE COUNTY OF SANTA BARBARA. AND WESTERN VENTURA COUNTY BOTH OF WHICH RIGHT NOW OR UNDER MANDATORY EVACUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE FIRES. WE'RE EXPECTING SOME MAJOR RAINS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SIMILAR. OF MUD. AND DEBRIS. EVENTS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAD JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO SO. I GOT AN EYE ON. MY PHONE IF YOU DON'T MIND TO WHILE I HEAR HOW THINGS ARE GOING. UP BUT THIS IS A A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION ABOUT INSURANCE IN THE ERA OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND. I AM DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED TODAY BY MEMBERS OF THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE INCLUDING. THE NEW IS CHAIR OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE SENATORS STEVE GLAZER WHO. IS NOW THE OFFICIAL CHAIR OF THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS EVENT OF THIS AFTERNOON. AND WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND A WARM WELCOME TO OUR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE AND ALL THE. DISTINGUISHED IT WITNESSES AND GUESS WHO TRAVELED FROM. OF ALL OVER THE STATE TO BE WITH US TODAY AND TO DISCUSS WITH US. THE TOPIC OF DRAW TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND FIRE. HOW IS THE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET RESPONDING? AND. THIS PAST YEAR IS SO I THINK WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED ITS LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE. WILDFIRE SEASON IN HISTORY. NEARLY NINE THOUSAND. WILD FIRES IGNITED ACROSS THE STATE. BURNING OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLIONACRES OF LAND I MEAN THESE NUMBERS ARE JUST ASTRONOMICAL AND SHOCKING. IT DESTROYED THESE FIRES DESTROYED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STRUCTURES. KILLED AT LEAST FORTY SIX PEOPLE. AND FIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES ON RECORD OCCURRED. IN THIS PAST YEAR INCLUDING THE THOMAS FIRE WHICH BURNED WHOLLY WITHIN THE NINETEENTH SENATE DISTRICT. AND OF. BEGAN ON DECEMBER FOURTH SOMETHING WHICH IN AND OF ITSELF IS QUITE IN AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENT TO A GIVEN THAT. THE TRADITIONAL FIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA RUNS FROM ABOUT APRIL TO OCTOBER. OF THIS YEAR THIS FIRE STARTED LITERALLY AN HOUR AND A HALF AFTER I'D GAVEL DOWN A HEARING. TALKING ABOUT OUR EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY HAD. WORKED OR FAILED IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER. SO. WE ARE LOOKING AT. A A NEW REALITY HERE POWER WE ARE LOOKING AT A TWELFTH MONTH YOUR FIRE SEASON. AND INDEED THE. THOMAS FIRE BURNED OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND ACRES MAKING IT THE LARGEST WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. IT BURNED FOR FORTY DAYS. FORTY DAYS FORTY NIGHTS. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAD TO. A LIVE WITHIN THAT IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC I THINK NATURAL DISASTERS ONE CAN EXPERIENCE IN OF COURSE. OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. DID AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB BUT NONETHELESS WE STILL LOST OVER THOUSAND STRUCTURES IN THAT AREA. AND THAT WAS A BEFORE. THE RAIN ADVANTAGE IN THEIR MIND A SIDO UM WHICH ACTUALLY OCCURRED THREE DAYS BEFORE THE THOMAS FAR WAS ACTUALLY EVEN FULLY CONTAINED THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. NATURE IS NOT BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH US RECENTLY AND. WE GOT INFECTED MONASHEE DOVE RIGHT AFTER THE FIRES IN THE ENTIRE BURDEN KILL SIDE. THEY HAD A RECORD HALF INCH OF RAIN IN FIVE MINUTES. WHICH IS WHAT PRECIPITATED THESE MUD SLIDES. AND. CREATED. A RIVER OF MUD IN BOULDERS AND DEBRIS USE THAT I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SEEN. BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ULTIMATELY KILLED AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE PEOPLE. AND DAMAGED OR DESTROYED MORE THAN ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED HOMES SO. NOT INCLUDING THAT OF FANTASY THE PROJECTED INSURANCE LOSSES FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EXCEED. OVER TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND UNFORTUNATELY. THIS DOES NOT THIS YEAR DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AN ABNORMALITY. TO THE CONTRARY MOST OF OUR LARGEST FIRES WILDFIRES HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS AND WAS MENTIONED. A OF FIVE OF THE TOP FIRES JUSTIN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO. CLEARLY CHANGING CLIMATE PATTERNS HAVE MADE OUR STATE MORE VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRES WITH MASSIVE TREE DIOXIN INSECT INFESTATIONS. YEAR ROUND FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND CRITICAL LEVELS OF FUELS ACCUMULATIONS. ALL OF COMBINED TO CREATE SEVERE FIRE RISKS POWER THROUGHOUT. CALIFORNIAN DEED WE ARE A SPEND NOW ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BILL THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION TREES HAVE DIED AND ARE STILL. POTENTIAL FUEL FOR ADDITIONAL FIRES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE SO. THAT ALONE SHOULD GIVE US BECAUSE. THE AND GIVE US PAUSE FOR A WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE THE NATIONAL INTERAGENCY FIRE CENTER'S PREDICTIVE OUTLOOK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IS FORECASTING ABOVE NORMAL LARGE FIRE POTENTIAL IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE PERSISTENCE OF THOSE DRY FUELS THE FREQUENT OFFSHORE WINDS WERE GETTING. AND THE GENERALLY UNFAVORABLE WEATHER THAT IS BEING PREDICTED SO THIS NEW NORMAL. OF YEAR ROUND SEVERE FIRE RISK HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S HOMEOWNERS WILL BE ABLE TO FIND. AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNER INSURANCE MOVING INTO THE FUTURE. AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM HOWEVER ALL INDICATORS SUGGEST THAT THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET. IS STILL FUNCTIONING AND FUNCTION WELL IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT IS AT LEAST THE IMMEDIATE GOOD NEWS. AND WHILE SOME COMPANIES MAY B CHOOSING NOT TO RENEW. POLICIES IN CERTAIN AREAS IT APPEARS THAT. OTHER CARRIERS ARE ACTIVELY FILLING THESE VOIDS AND INDIVIDUALS STILL TO THIS DAY HAVE A RANGE OF CHOICES. AMONG CARRIERS AND POLICY SO AT LEAST THE SNAPSHOT FROM TODAY. DOES APPEAR TO BE FAVORABLE. GOING FORWARD A WE WILL BE HEARING TODAY FROM A VARIETY OF FOLKS IN THE INSURANCE MARKET. IN INDUSTRY. WILL HEAR ALSO FROM. THE. OF THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING THE FIRES ON THE GROUND WILL BE HEARING FROM OUR STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. FROM A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE AND. HOPEFULLY WE WILL THEN HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT WHERE WE WILL ASK YOU IF YOU DO WISH TO SPEAK AS A MEMBER THE PUBLIC. TO COME TO THAT MICROPHONE AND TO. GIVE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND. WILL GIVE YOU UP TO A TWO MINUTES TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS WITH US SO. AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE. DAVE JONES WITH US AND I AM A PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HEARING THE THOUGHTS ON THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMEOWNER INSURANCE MARKET. THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. OF FOR MOST OF US FOR MANY OF US AT LEAST OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET IF WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE GOTTEN IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET. IN A TIMELY ENOUGH FASHION TO BE ABLE TO BUY OR HOMES AND TO RETAIN HOMEOWNERSHIP. IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE PROTECT THAT ASSET SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS DISCUSSION OF LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO MY CO CHAIR SENATOR PLACER FOR ANY OPENING COMMENTS. THANK YOU. CHAIR JACKSON. BEGINNING US ON THE AYE AYE THE RIGHT FOOT WITH THE GREAT PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE AT THE BROADER SITUATION THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE ASKING THAT QUESTION IS IS THE NEW NORMAL. THAT WE'RE GONNA FACE AYE GOING FORWARD BUT I WANT TO JOIN IN IN. AND THANKING THE MEMBERS FOR PARTICIPATING DAR WITNESSES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR. BY. BEING HERE FOR THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT TO WHAT ALL THESE THINGS GLOBAL WARMING DROUGHT FIRE WHAT IS IT ALL MEAN FOR THE HOMEOWNERS MARKET AND. REALLY MY OF MY SUMMING UP OF THE. OF THE QUESTION IS THAT WE'VE IF WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER LEGISLATION. ODD IN RESPONSE TO THESE. THESE ISSUES. I KNOW IT IS OUR JOB TO LOOK OUT FOR THE CONSUMERS. AND THAT INCLUDES DOING WHAT WE CAN TO PRESERVE A FUNCTIONING INSURANCE MARKETS. SO THAT EVERYONE WHO NEEDS COVERAGE YAKKING GET IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE AT THE TESTIMONY TODAY. WOULD ANY OTHER MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU OTHER GAMES ARE MUCH SENATOR JACKSON. JUST. AS WE ENTERED TO THIS DISCUSSION. WITH. MARKET RESPONSE. AND ADEQUATE. ACCESS TO MARKETS ENOUGH FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. I WOULD JUST ASK THAT WE BE CAREFUL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE. MAINTAIN CAPACITY I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I TAKE A LOOK AT OUR. THE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE IN THE MARKETPLACE FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. IT SEEMS TO BE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. AND AYE I SPEAK FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT. WERE ABLE TO HANDLE. WITHIN MY OWN INSURANCE AGENCY. WE'VE GOT A NUMBER WERE INDEPENDENT AGENTS BROKERS SO. OUR SITUATION MAYBE IT'S DIFFERENT. BUT SOME AGENTS BUT. WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO. TO MARKETS. FOR FIRE COVERAGE EVEN THE HIGHER PROTECTION CLASS CODES. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW IS THERE AN OPTION THROUGH. THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. THAT IS SO A PATHWAY ALSO BUT. TYPICALLY WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH JUST THE ADMITTED MARKET MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN PUT PEOPLE. IN GOOD COMPANIES THAT ARE ADMITTED. AND THE REGULATED. AND THEN. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YEAH WE HAVE THE FOR THE FAIR PLAN THERE'S THAT THERE'S ACCESS TO THE FAIR PLAN. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU CAN'T GET COVERAGE ANYWHERE ELSE. AND. FROM WHAT I'M HEARING IN IT. POLICE. REVIEWS THIS AND. IF I'M AND CRACKED CRACKED ME BUT. FROM WHAT I'M BEING TOLD IS THAT THE FAIR PLAN IS NOT. SEEING A HUGE INCREASE. THEN DEMAND. AND. BUT I TALK TO OUR MARKETS AND. WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE BILL AVAILABILITY OF COVERAGE? I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS YOUR SEEN SOME MARKETS PULLING IN. AND. PUT UP OTHERS PULLING OUT SO YOUR YOUR SEEN CHANGING OCCURRING WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE. AND SO THAT'S GONNA DISRUPT SOME FOLKS THAT ARE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT NOW HOW DO I GET COVERAGE. AND. THE COSTS THAT COVERS MAYBE MORE WHAT THEY'RE PAYING. WE FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE TO ADMITTED MARKETS THAT. WE'VE JUST A BROUGHT INTO OUR AGENCY. THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO APPOINT NEW AGENCIES SO. I JUST KIND OF WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE DELVE FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE AND THEN WE WILL HAVE LEGISLATION IS MOVING FORWARD TO. MUCH OF IT PRIDE VERY GOOD. BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE BALL IN TERMS OF THOSE ISSUES. CAP. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT OF TRYING TO DO SOMETHING GOOD. BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT AND I COURSE THAT IS PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE HERE CENTER MORE LIKE TO WE SHOULD SAY THAT. CHAIR OF THIS IS MY AND I'M ROLE MEETING. AS A MEMBER OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSION SO. CENTER JACKSON IF YOU COULD MAKE SURE THAT SENATOR GLAZERS EASY ON ME. TODAY YOU NOT KIND OF SENSITIVE. I'M BUT. WELL NATION MY FATHER. MY FATHER RAISED ME. BY EARNING A LIVING AS. A SALESMAN IN INSURANCE HE WAS A CHARTERED LIFE UNDERWRITER. AND ALSO SOLD LIFE INSURANCE AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY SO. I'M ALSO A CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER BUT I NEVER GOT A LICENSE TO SELL INSURANCE BUT TED. AS A CPA DID HAVE A CLIENT THAT WAS AN INSURANCE COMPANY IT WAS FUN TO BE INSIDE. THE BOOKS OF OF OF OF ONE SO I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO LEARNING A LOT HERE. BUT I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE HOW WE INTERPLAY WITH THE MARKET. SO THAT WE DON'T. GET IN ITS WAY BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE A WAY OF SELF CORRECTING. OVER THESE THINGS I'M I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THE EDUCATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. A DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE START TALKING ABOUT LARGE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS ALIKE FIRES WE'VE EXPERIENCED. HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE REPRESENTING A NO. ACTIONS COMMISSIONERS WELL YOU KNOW WE ARE BIG THINGS FLOODS BUT WE'VE MADE A POLICY DECISION LEASES A COUNTRY TO KIND OF MOVE THAT OUT THE MARKET IS A SEPARATE. DEAL OUT OF IT WONDERED FEDERAL THE FEDERAL PLAN THINK WHEN THINGS I THINK ABOUT IS HOW DO WE. KNOW HANDLE LARGE SCALE LOSSES AND STILL PROTECT YOU KNOW HAVE A WORKING INSURANCE MARKET. RIGHT SO YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT EARTHQUAKES YOU KNOW THE FIRES. OTHER TYPES OF EVENTS AS WELL AND CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING. THAT'S MY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT WORK BOTH FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THE PROTECTION IN THE SAFETY NET OF THE PROTECTION. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE EVENTS HAPPENED RIGHT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE WATER REBUILDING TO DO. AND HOW HOW WE ENSURE THAT HAPPENS AND AND AND AND IS DONE IN A WAY THAT. RESTORES THOSE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT IT EACH INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS THAT CUMULATIVE IMPACT. REGIONAL LOSSES HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE NUMEROUS LOSSES OF. WHAT TIMES YOU GET YOU KNOW GET HOMEOWNERS UNDER SHARON'S FOR FIRE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WELL MAYBE SOMETHING THAT? HAPPENED ON YOUR PROPERTY IT BECAUSE YOUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN NOT YOUR ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD. RIGHT AND SO. EVEN IF YOU BUILD ONE OR TWO AND HALF THE REST OF THE BLOCK ISN'T BILL THAT AFFECTS ACTUALLY THE VALUE OF YOUR OWN HOME THAT AFFECTS THE ACTUALLY THE LIVABILITY OF IN TERMS OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND SO FORTH. SO WE HAVE THESE CUMULATIVE FACTS WHEN YOU HAVE MASS KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE. DESTRUCTION THAT SO WIDESPREAD IN THE COMMUNITY SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. NO ONE POLICY BUT ONE POLICY IT'S A CUMULATIVE EFFECT THAT WE NEED TO DRESS AS WELL THANK YOU. WELL I THINK THAT'S A PERFECT SEGUE WHO NOW HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT TO WERE ALL ANXIOUS TO HEAR ABOUT SO.

A CONSTITUENTS HAVE A SUFFER DIRECTLY FROM THE FIRES AND DAB WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY. WITH THOSE SENATORS WITH THOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHOSE CONSTITUENTS ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE FIRES IT'S BEEN. A HERCULEAN EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE MEMBERS AND SENATORS AS WELL AS OUR OFFICE INTO. I THINK WE CAN. CONTINUE TO. UNDERSTAND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE TO KEEP WORKING TO HELP PEOPLE BECAUSE THE ROAD TO RECOVERY IS A SPLIT ALONG AND PAINFUL ONE BUT. THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF CENTER JACKSON OTHERS IN THEIR. IN THEIR DISTRICTS SCORE THAT SLIDE SO I'M. BECAUSE. WHO HAS POINTED OUT? IN THE INTRODUCTORY REMARKS OF THESE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES WERE. AMONG THE MOST DEVASTATING FIRES COLLECTIVELY ES SADLY SOME SIXTY NINE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. AB BETWEEN THE FIRES IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEN THE MUD FLOWS IN MUCH ACETO IN THE CHAIRWOMAN'S DISTRICT. NEAR SANTA BARBARA. MANY OF YOU THAT NO DOUBT OF TALK TO FIRE SERVER SURVIVORS I HAVE HEARD FIRST HAND. THEIR HARROWING TALES. PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES AND WE'RE LUCKY TO NOT LOSE THEIR LIVES ESCAPING WITHIN SECONDS. OF LOSING THEIR LIVES. MY THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS COULD YOU TO BE WITH THEM. AS THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES A STRUGGLE TO RECOVER AND AS WE COLLECTIVELY THINK ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE PUBLIC POLICY RESPONSES TO THESE EVENTS. ABOUT WE SHOULD CONTINUE KEEP I THINK IN OUR MINDS YOU KNOW YOU TO FORMOSA SURVIVORS. THOSE WHO LOST LOVED ONES THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES LOST THEIR PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS IN THEIR MEMORIES. THEY DO FACE A LONG AND DIFFICULT ROAD. THE FALL TWENTY SEVEN. TEEN ILLUSTRATED IN DRAMATIC AND TRAGIC FORM A THAT WE NOW LIVE WITH THE YEAR ON FIRE SEASONS BEEN COMMENTED ON BY OUR GOVERNOR BY. FIRE OFFICIALS YOU PROBABLY HEAR THE SAME TODAY. IN A TWENTY SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES. SOMETIMES ONLY MINUTES TO SPARE AS THESE WIND DRIVEN WILD FIRES SWEPT THROUGH AND DESTROYED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES BUSINESSES AND VEHICLES. AND ALSO TOOK THE LIFE OF ONE FIREFIGHTER ACCORDING IVERSON. A DEADLY WILDFIRES IN DECEMBER WERE VIRTUALLY UNHEARD OF AND YET. THOMAS FIRE. AS THE CHAIR WITH A NOTED BURNED FOR NEARLY THE ENTIRE MONTH OF DECEMBER. AND IT'S A RECORD BREAKERS THE LARGEST MOST DAMAGING FIRE STATE'S HISTORY TERMS ACREAGE. CHARRING MORE THAN TWO AND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND. ACRES. NOW IN RESPONSE TO BOTH THE NORTH BAY AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES EYES THE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE TOOK A NUMBER OF IMMEDIATE STEPS TO HELP. THE FACT THAT RESIDENTS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING SIGNING ORDERS IT CUT THROUGH RED TAPE. ALLOWING INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY TO HELP RESIDENTS GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO START THE RECOVERY. AND REBUILDING PROCESS. I MOBILIZED OUR TEAMS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO WILDFIRE SURVIVORS I SHOULD OFFICIAL NOTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING PUBLIC ADJUSTERS INSURERS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTERS REMINDED. OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO KNOW AND FOLLOW ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO CLAIM SETTLEMENT. I WILL NOTE THAT SOME CONSUMERS INITIALLY WERE. PROVIDED INCORRECT INFORMATION A BY THEIR AGENTS OR THEIR INSURERS AND THAT CAUSED ME ISSUE A FORMAL NOTICE DIRECTING INSURERS TO TAKE STEPS TO ME THE CORRECT THAT PROBLEM AND THEY DID. WE STOP GETTING THOSE COMPLAINTS. IN ADDITION. ARE CONSUMER SERVICES TEAMS WORKED IN THE MANY LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS EVER STOOD UP BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROVIDING ONE ON ONE SUPPORT FOR THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS. ARE INSURANCE. INVESTIGATORS DETECTIVES WHO ARE ENFORCEMENT BRANCH TEAMED UP WITH THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD AND LOCAL DE ARES. TO ATTEND TOWN HALL MEETINGS AND TO VISIT AFFECTED NEIGHBORHOODS TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD TO SUPPRESS TO PREVENT SCAM ARTISTS WHO OFTENTIMES FLOOD INTO AREAS AFFECTED BY. DISASTERS LIKE THIS AND PRAY ON THOSE IMPACTED BY DISASTERS I PERSONALLY VISITED EVACUATION CENTERS BURN AREAS AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE FULLY STAFFED AND DOING. THE JOB WE NEED TO DO ANY WITH FIRE SURVIVORS IN BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HERE FIRST AND WHAT THEY NEEDED SO THAT I COULD BE GUIDED. BY THEIR NEEDS IN THE ACTIONS THAT I WAS TAKING AS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. I'VE DIRECTED BY TEAM THAT TO CAN IT WORK CONTINUE WORKING TO HELP RESIDENTS NAVIGATE THE CLAIMS PROCESS. AND CONTINUE TO WORK TO DETER SCAMS BY THOSE UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE LOOK FOR WAYS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE IN THEIR TIME. OF NEED SURVIVORS ARE ENTITLED TO INSURANCE BENEFITS THAT THEY'VE BEEN LOYALLY PAYING PREMIUMS FOR ALL THESE YEARS. AND I AND MY TEAM ARE THERE TO HELP CONSUMERS LET'S GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO. LET ME UPDATE YOU. ON THE MOST RECENT A TOTAL INSURED LOSSES AT FIGURES THAT WE HAVE AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THESE ARE NOT ESTIMATES. A THESE ARE ACTUAL. INSURED LOSSES BASED ON CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED. WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES BY THE GRAND TOTAL CURRENTLY IS TWELVE POINT THREE. BILLION DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCTOBER AND DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES WITH ROUGHLY FOUR FIFTHS OF THAT. COMING FROM THE NORTH BAY FIRES AND STARTED EARLY OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW WE'VE BROKEN THE NUMBERS OUT ACROSS RESIDENTIAL PERSONAL PROPERTY COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IN OUR OWN OTHER LINES AND AS YOU CAN SEE. A LARGER SHARE OF THE TOTAL Q. OF LOSSES FALL IN THE AREA OF RESIDENTIAL PERSONAL PROPERTY BOTH IN TERMS OF THE. ACCURATE LOSSES AS WELL AS THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS THAT WHILE THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND AUTO ANOTHER LINES MAKE UP. THE REMAINDER BANG TERMS OF THE TOTAL LOSSES WERE SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TOTAL LOSSES. AND THREE HEARD TO COMMERCIAL TOTAL LOSSES IN TWENTY SEVENTY. OF THESE ARE STAGGERING AND ON PRESIDENT LOSSES BOTH THE CHAIRS NOTED ABOUT THESE ARE MORE THAN JUST NUMBERS BEHIND THESE NUMBERS ARE REAL PEOPLE. WHOSE LIVES WERE TREMENDOUSLY DEVASTATED AND DISRUPTED BY THESE FIRES AND SO AS WE LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THE HUMAN TRAGEDY THAT LIES BEHIND THEM THE LIVES LOST. THE HOMES LOST PEOPLE'S ENTIRE. PRECIOUS MEMORIES AND BELONGINGS LOST AS WELL RECORDS A COMMON THEME AS YOU AND I MEET WITH THE FIRE SURVIVORS IS A DESIRE TO RETURN TO NORMALCY TO REBUILD. THAT TO GET BACK TO NORMAL LA AND THAT. THE IS A VERY UNDERSTANDABLE DESIRE AND ONE THAT WE SHARE AND ONE THAT WE'RE COLLECTIVELY DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP PEOPLE WITH. NOW ONE OF THE TOPICS OF THIS HEARING OF COURSE IS OUT. HOW THIS STAGE TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES OF AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE COVERAGE? ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS THAT THIS HAS BEEN A GROWING CHALLENGE THE IN A CERTAIN AREAS OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THE SO CALLED WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS IT'S A WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS. IN FACT THEY BURNED AREAS THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY INSURERS AND JUST ABOUT EVERYONE AT ONE HOUSE AS BEING RELATIVELY AT A LOWER RISK OF FIRE. A THIS INCLUDES WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THAT AND COFFEE PARK I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR BICU HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHY COMING OUT OF THAT. I'VE VISITED IT LOOKED LIKE A WAR ZONE AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD WIPED OUT. AS WELL AS A SECOND NEIGHBORHOOD FOUND GROVE IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS A STARKLY HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS MEDIUM ARE GENERALLY LOWER FIRE RISK THAT IS NEW. AND SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS I KNOW THAT THE INSURERS WERE. SO LAST YEAR OF I DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO PREPARE A EPORT. ON THE GROWING PROBLEM OF FIRE INSURANCE AVAILABILITY AFFORDABILITY AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL LAWS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. THAT WE RELEASED A REPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WE SENT A COPY DAHLE UNDER TWENTY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE KNOWLEDGE JUST PARTIES AND WE PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN ADDITIONAL. COPY NO REPORT MAKES A A NUMBER OF FINDINGS ONE IS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES WILDFIRES HAVE CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN THE WILDLAND URBAN YOUR FACE COUNTIES WHICH IS DEFINED AS THE AREAS OR HOMES ARE INTERMIXED IN THE CITY OF WILDLAND VEGETATION SUCH AS FOR SOME BRUSH NOW. THIS INCLUDES PRINCIPALLY THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAIN RANGE THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS AND ALSO THE COASTAL RANGE THAT NORTHERN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE ARE NUMEROUS CANYONS AND OTHER FEATURES. AREAS LIKE THIS ACTUALLY EXIST ALL OVER CALIFORNIA JUST MORE CONCENTRATED IN PARTICULAR AREAS IN PARTICULAR COUNTIES. NOW THE PROXIMALLY THIRTEEN POINT SIX MILLION HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S AN ESTIMATED THREE POINT SIX MILLION HOMES IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION OF THOSE HOMES. IN WATER DESCRIBED AS HIGH OR VERY HIGH RISK OF FIRE AREAS ACCORDING TO THE INSURERS MODELS. MORE THAN HALF THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR HOMES IN THIS CATEGORY OF HIGH OR VERY HIGH RISK. AND DUE TO DROUGHT CLIMATE CHANGE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE CAN ANTICIPATE AN OPTICALLY THINK IN THE WAKE OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES WE CAN ANTICIPATE. THAT INSURERS WILL BE UPDATING THE RISK MODELS AND MORE HOMES AND MORE AREAS THE STATE. WILL BE RATED AT HIGH OR VERY HIGH RISK NOW OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THAT MY DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED AN INCREASED NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FEEDBACK AND OTHER EVIDENCE FROM CONSUMERS. CONSUMER GROUPS A HANDOUT. FROM ABOUT. OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS LOCAL OFFICIALS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AVAILABILITY NOW HIRES FIRES IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREA. VERTICALLY FROM ADMITTED CARRIERS A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE MADE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ADMITTED MARKET WHICH IS FULLY REGULATED THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET WHICH IS NOT WHICH IS IMPORT MARKET IN THE FAIR PLAN WHICH IS THE INSURER OFLAST RESORT. THAT OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON ALL THREE BUT PRINCIPALLY BY THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INSURANCE FROM THE ADMITTED MARKET IN THE COMMON THEME OF THESE COMMUNICATIONS WHETHER IT'S COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS ARE LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS RATHER STAKEHOLDERS. IS THAT IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADMITTED KOMMER ADMITTED RESIDENTIAL CARE COVERAGE IN THESE AREAS. AND PRICES ARE GOING UP AS WELL SO LET'S GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. NOW. WE GO UP TO THE NEXT ONE AFTER THAT ARE THERE WE GO HERE IT IS. IT'S COMING. SO ONE OF THE FINDINGS IN OUR REPORT I IT WAS TO LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF NINE RENEWABLES BECAUSE THAT WAS THE COMPLAINT WE WERE GETTING FROM SOME PEOPLE WAS I HAD INSURANCE WITH ENSURE ACTS. AND THE NEXT YEAR THEY DIDN'T RENEW ME. SO SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THE YEARS TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH WERE THE LATEST YEARS FOR WHICH WE HAD DATA. A LOT THERE WAS A FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN NON RENEWALS IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE COUNTIES THAT WAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OFHIGH IN VERY HIGH. A RISK SO I THINK THAT'S IT THE IMPORTANT A FIGURE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL FIFTEEN PERCENT. I COULDN'T FIND INSURANCE A BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THEIR CURRENT CARRIER SAID WE'RE NOT RENEWING YOU YOU'VE GOT TO GO LOOK SOME PEOPLE FOUND ADMITTED CARRIER INSURANCE SOME PEOPLE WANT THE SURPLUS LINES SOME PEOPLE. WENT TO THE FAIR PLAN. NOW LET ME JUST PAUSE A MOMENT TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FAIR PLAN OVER FORTY YEARS AGO THE LIST LEGISLATURE ENACTED A LAW SIGNED BY THEN GOVERNOR RONALD REAGAN. TO CREATE A NONPROFIT FIRED SURE OF LAST RESORT CALLED THE FAIR PRESS PLAN WHICH YOU WRITE FIRE INSURANCE FOR ANY HOMEOWNER IN RURAL. OR URBAN AREAS WHO COULD NOT FIND FIRE INSURANCE ON THE PRIVATE MARKET. THE FAIR PLAN IS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE ONE IMPORTANT DECATUR OF THE AVAILABILITY OR LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF HOME INSURANCE FROM MINUTE COMMERCIAL CARRIERS. IS CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF FIRE INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN BY THE FAIR PLAY SO IT BEARS NOTE I THINK WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE. AS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FAIR PLAN HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY DWELLING POLICIES IN FORCE WITH ONLY THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN OF THEM. OR THIRTY ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT WRITTEN IN THE HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS OF THE STATE. BUT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE FAIR PLAY AND IS THAT THAT LYING SURE THE FAIR PLAN POLICIES ARE ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN LARGE URBANIZED AREAS LIKE LOS ANGELES WERE SADLY THERE INCIDENTS OF OUR SINS AND OTHER KINDS OF FIRES A BECAUSE. IT MEDICARE'S TO DECIDE THAT'S IS TOO MUCH RISK. AND SO OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE SIXTY TOTAL FAIR PLAN POLICIES ONLY THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HERSELF EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN. ARE IN THE RURAL HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS HOWEVER A FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FAIR PLAN HAS INCREASED ITS WRITINGS IN THE HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS. WHICH INDICATES THAT SOMEONE HOMEOWNERS ARE NOT FINDING AVAILABLE INSURANCE IN THAT TRADITIONAL MARKET AND FOR THOSE HOMEOWNERS IT IS A PROBLEM IT IS A CHALLENGE. AND THERE'S A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THOSE HOMES IN PARTICULAR COUNTIES SO THIS IS BEING FELT MOST ACUTELY IN PARTICULAR COUNTIES AS WELL. KNOW OUR DATA SHOWS THE FAIR PLANTS NEW BUSINESS WRITINGS IN THE HIGH RISK FIRES ALMOST DOUBLED WELL RENEWALS IN THESE AREAS INCREASED BALLOTS FOR A THIRTY PERCENT LET'S GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO LET ME REPEAT THAT AGAIN. THEIR NEW WRITINGS ALMOST DOUBLED. WENT UP BY FORTY ONE PERCENT. AND THEIR ENEWALS INCREASED BY THIRTY PERCENT WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE THAT HAD THE FAIR PLAN. THAT WE SAW AN INCREASE IN THE PEOPLE STICKING WITH THE FAIR PLAN BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIND OTHER INSURANCE OUTSIDE OF THE FAIR PLAN. SO. IT MARCH TWENTY SIXTEEN I TESTIFIED BEFORE THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE AND AYE A TESTIFIED AT THAT TIME THAT FOUR YEARS OF DROUGHT COMBINED WITH MORE HOMES BUILT IN HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS. WITH INSURERS USE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED FORTRESS MODELS HAD RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES AND DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE HIGH RISK FACTORS THAT WASN'T TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WAS. EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE LAST YEAR'S EVENTS CERTAINLY LAST YEAR'S EVENTS UNDERSCORE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS CONTINUING TO GROW. BY AND WE SEE MORE INSURERS CHOOSING TO NOT RENEW COVERAGE FOR EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS WHOSE HOMES FACE A HIGH RISK OF FIRE. IN SOME INSURERS CHOOSING NOT TO WRITE NEW HOMEOWNERS POLICIES IN LARGE SWATHS OF THE HIGH RISK. AREAS AND WE KNOW FROM EVALUATING UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES FROM CONSUMER COMPLAINTS THAT INSURERS ARE BEGINNING TO AVOID HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS OR LIMITING THE NUMBER POLICIES ARE WILLING TO WRITE. IN SUCH AREAS. NOW. UP BECAUSE A IT EACH INSURED THEMSELVES DECIDES WHAT THE RISK APPETITE IS AND WHERE THEY GONNA WRITE HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO WRITE. THAT THERE ARE NONE THE LESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOMEOWNER NON RENEWED BY ONE INSURER TO POTENTIALLY FIND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ANOTHER SHARE. WITH A DILIGENT SEARCH. HOWEVER. SOME CONSUMERS ARE FINDING THEY CAN'T FIND INSURANCE LIMITED MARKET. AYE AND IF YOU HAVE A MORTGAGE LIKE MOST OF US DO. YOU HAVE TO HAVE COVERAGE MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE. AND CURRENT LAW DOES GIVE INSURERS BROAD LATITUDE IN DECIDING WHETHER TO WRITE FOR CERTAIN RISKS. INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO KLEIN WRITING POLICIES FOR HOMES AND BUSINESSES AND THEY CAN CHARGE MORE FOR HIGHER RISK TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT EXPECTED LOSSES ASSOCIATED. WITH THOSE RECEIPTS IMPORTERS STAND THAT IS THE NATURE OF INSURANCE IT'S A PRODUCT THAT'S DESIGNED AT TO ENCOMPASS RISK IN THE PRICED RELATED. TO RISK. TWELVE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR HOMES RATED AS HIGH OR VERY HIGH RISK. OF WILDFIRE BY THE TWO PRIMARY WILDFIRE RISK MODELS USED BY INSURERS FOR EXAMPLE. EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE HOMES IN TWELVE THE COUNTY ARE LOCATED IN THE HIGHER VERY HIGH RISK AREA. pSIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF HOMES IN THESE CATEGORIES SO THERE IS A CONCENTRATION OF THIS PHENOMENA WITHIN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN CERTAIN. COUNTIES NOW. I DIRECTED AT MY DEPARTMENT TAKE A A NUMBER OF STEPS A BEFORE AND AFTER THE MARCH TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT I SENATE HEARING. A ONE WAS A DIRECTED THAT WE PARTICIPATE THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE INSURANCE SUB GROUP. AND THIS GROUP IS BEEN CHARGED WITH IDENTIFYING INSURANCE ISSUES CAUSED BY THE MASSIVE NUMBER OF DYING TREES IN AREAS A CALIFORNIAN INCREASE RISK OF WILDFIRE. THAT TASK FORCE WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IS MEETING NOW FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS SINCE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER PROBLEMS IN SOME PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER WITHOUT NEW LAWS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TASK FORCE'S RECOMMENDATIONS REMAINS A CHALLENGE THAT AS THEIR PROPOSED SOLUTIONS CURRENTLY RELY ON INSURERS MAKING VOLUNTARY CHANGES. IN THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR DECISION MAKING. SO THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THEN BY LESS LEGISLATURE ACTS WITH REGARD TO THE TASK FORCE'S RECOMMENDATIONS I ALSO DIRECTED MY DEPARTMENT UNDERTAKE ITS OWN ANALYSIS AND COME UP WITH SOME PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AS WELL IN THOSE ARE CONTAINED IN THE REPORT THAT WE RELEASED. EARLIER THIS YEAR AT SO I'VE SHARED WITH YOU AYE SOME OF THE RESULTS. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BASED ON CONSUMER COMPLAINTS STEMMING FROM A RENEWAL ISSUES WE'RE ALSO SEEING CONSUMER COMPLAINTS OF LARGE PREMIUM INCREASES IN THOSE ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. THAT PARTICULAR IN THE ZIP CODES DESIGNATED BY CAL FIRE AS HAVING THE GREATEST RISK OF WILDFIRE. WITH REGARD TO COMPLAINTS FORGETTING ABOUT INCREASE PREMIUMS THE CALIFORNIA DESIGNATED ZIP CODES MAKE UP MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THOSE COMPLAINTS. SO WE HAVE SEEN SEVERAL MAJOR INSURERS BEGINNING TO PULL BACK FROM READING NEW BUSINESS. AND ALSO DECLINING TO RENEW. WE'VE SEEN SOME INCREASE IN FAIR PLAN WRITING AND WE'VE SEEN SOME INCREASE IN WRITING BY THE SURPLUS LINES INSURERS. NOW THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT ENACTED ANY SPECIFIC STATURE STANDARDS TO RESTRICT THE USE OF OR ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THESE WILDFIRE RISK MODELS THAT THE INSURERS ARE USING. AND THERE'S NO MECHANISM IN PLACE FOR CONSUMERS TO APPEAL THESE MODELS SO ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT YOU DO EXACTLYTHAT. AYE THAT YOU ABOUT REQUIRE THE MODELS TO BE FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND YOU GIVE THE DEPARTMENT AFTER YOUR REVIEW AND APPROVE THEM WHAT'S PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATING FOR HOMEOWNERS THAT IS WHEN THEY TAKE STEPS THAT THEIR LOCAL FIRE OFFICIALS HAVE ENCOURAGED THEM TO TAKE. TO CREATE MORE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND OTHERWISE MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE DEFENSIBLE FROM FIRE THAT THOSE PARTICULAR MITIGATION MEASURES ARE NOT IN SOME MODELS REFLECTED BY THE MODELS RICH SCORE. IN SOME CASES EFFORTS COMMUNITIES ARE TAKING TO BETTER DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM FIRE ARE ALSO NOT BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. A BY THE MODELS HENCE OUR RECOMMENDATION TO YOU ARE THAT THE MODELS BE REQUIRED TO BE FILED AND THAT WE BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. I TO REVIEW THEM THAT ACCORDINGLY. NOW I THINK THE OTHER. THAT THING THAT WE'VE DONE AS WELL AS WE'VE TAKEN SOME IMPORTANT STEPS WITH REGARD THE FAIR PLAN TO MAKE SURE. I IT'S MORE WIDELY KNOWN THAT IT EXISTS THAT WE MAY ASK THE FAIR PLAYING TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT APPROVED ITS TO ITS POLICIES IN MARKETING. BUT CONDUCTED OUTREACH. DEMI VAST AND IN FACT WE SPONSORED LEGISLATION CARRIED BY SENATOR MCGUIRE THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES THAT INSURERS AND AGENTS AND BROKERS TO INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY. OF THE FAIR PLAN WE'RE ALSO ENCOURAGING INSURERS TO WRITE WHAT'S CALLED DIFFERENCES N CONDITIONS COVERAGE WHICH SITS ON TOP OF THE FAIR PLANTS UP A HOMEOWNER. HAS ONLY THE FAIR PLAN TO LOOK TO FOR FIRE INSURANCE WE'RE ASKING INSURERS TO WRITE COVERAGE ON TOP OF THAT SO HOMEOWNERS HAVE FULLY AVAILABLE. INSURANCE AVAILABLE TO THEM MISSIONER JONES COULD I ASK YOU ARE FREE TO A CLOSE. I I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED A GOOD POLITICIAN HAS A LOT TO SAY. GOOD INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAS A LOT TO SAY THERE YOU GO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT. BUT IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US. THE SORT OF. THE ESSENCE OF WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE US TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS WE GO FORWARD WONDERFUL SO LET ME JUST DRILL DOWN TO SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE. IN OUR REPORT OUTSIDE THAT WOULD REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO ENCOMPASS. ONE IS THOUGHT WE HAVE SUGGESTED I THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE INSURERS TO OFFER HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE IF% SPECIFIED PROVEN MITIGATION IMPROVEMENTS. HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE HOMEOWNER TO THE DWELLING STRUCTURE AND THE PROPERTY. AND. THAT'S STANDARD OF COURSE WOULD BE DEFINED BY YOU THE LEGISLATURE IT CAN BE AS HIGH AS YOU DEEM APPROPRIATE BUT THE NOTION WOULD BE IF HOMEOWNERS MEDIA STANDARD. THEN THEY SHOULD BE OFFERED INSURANCE NO ALTERNATIVE TO THAT WOULD BE TO SAY THE INSURER LOOK. YEAH I AS AN ALTERNATE ACTUALLY OFFERING THE INSURANCE AT A MINIMUM OFFER DIFFERENCES IN CONDITIONS POLICY SO THAT SOMEONE MEETS A STANDARD OF MITIGATION. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO OFFER THEM A HOME INSURANCE THAT THEY GET INSURANCE FROM THE FAIR PLAN AT LEAST GIVE THEM DIFFERENCES IN CONDITIONS COVERAGE SO THEY HAVE FULL INSURANCE A SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS TO REQUIRE INSURERS TO OFFER MITIGATION PREMIUM CREDIT. FOR THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE UNDERTAKEN PROVEN MITIGATION EFFORTS AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD DEFINE THOSE YOU COULD FIND THAT MITIGATION STANDARDS HIGH AS YOU WANT. OTHER WE THINK THE NOTION OF A PRIMA CREDIT MAKE SENSE BOTH AS AN INCENTIVE BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THOSE HOMEOWNERS IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DOING THINGS TO MAKE THEMSELVES MORE DEFENSIBLE. FROM FIRES I MENTIONED. REQUIRING INSURERS TO FILE OBTAIN APPROVAL OF THE LIVE VIRUS BOTTLES A FOURTH RECOMMENDATION IS AN APPEALS PROCESS FOR HOMEOWNERS. A FORD INSURERS ADVERSE DECISION TO NOT RENEW CANCEL IS FINALIZED RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO REAL MECHANISM FOR HOMEOWNERS TO APPEAL THAT OTHER THAN TO OUR DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE VERY LIMITED AUTHORITY WITH REGARD TO INSURERS UNDERWRITING. SOBRE SUGGESTING AN APPEAL MECHANISM FIFTH WE THINK THAT THERE BE SOME REAL VALUE IN TERMS OF STABILIZING THE RATING STRUCTURE BY. AUTHORIZING US TO GATHER INDUSTRY WIDE LOST DATA. ASSOCIATED A WITH THESE FIRES AND MAKE THAT A DATA AVAILABLE TO LL MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RATES IN PREMIUMS ARE ADEQUATE. BUT NOT EXCESSIVE FOR THE UNDERLYING WILDFIRE RISK SO THESE ARE SOME OF OUR A PRINCIPLE RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR REPORT. AND. LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I BELIEVE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE A VERY BALANCED AND NUANCED LA I'M ATTENTIVE TO THE CONCERNS OF SOME OF YOU HAVE RAISED. ABOUT A TAKING A BALANCED APPROACH HERE THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A ROBUST INSURANCE MARKET. THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE DEPARTMENT DIED THAT THE MARKET IS ROBUST THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD THAT WE'VE SEEN IN EXPANSION. IN A COVERAGE. OVER THE LAST NERVE YEARS FOR EXAMPLE ALL STATE CAME BACK IN THE MARKET THE OTHER YEAR AFTER BEING OUT OF THE MARKET FOR OVER A DECADE. AYE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE INSURERS ARE HERE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT CONSUMERS WHEN THEY'RE TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE RISK ARE A GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THEN TO HAVE INSURANCE SO THOSE ARE MY CLOSING THOUGHTS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR KIND ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK VERY HELPFUL IN A COURSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT MIGHT COME DOWN TO. A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT TO ADEQUATE AND NOT EXCESSIVE. AND I'M SURE THOSE WILL BE DISCUSSIONS WILL HAVE GOING FORWARD. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE MATTHEW RUSH MINUTES OUR NEXT SPEAKER AND GIVEN THAT HE IS NOT A IN THE POLITICAL WORLD BUT AS A FIREFIGHTER EXPECTED HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO KEEP WITHIN THAT. TEN MINUTE PERIOD AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR FOR QUESTIONS WAS ADAM. I I SHARE THAT ABSOLUTE OTHER NOMENCLATURE SO I'M TRYING TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT. WE DO HAVE SOME TIME CONSTRAINTS OF I'M SURE GO AHEAD I THINK INITIATE THAT. CHAIRS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATTHEW REISMAN CAL FIRE ON THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR RESOURCE PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT AND. NO ABSOLUTELY DON'T MIND YIELDING TIME TO A COMMISSIONER JONES IN IN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE HIS HIS COMMENT. AND THE SUPPORT THAT THEY PROVIDED A OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN REGARD TO INSURANCE AND OUR INVOLVEMENT AT THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE TO TRY TO DRILL DOWN. ON SOME OF THOSE. QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING INSURANCE SO WE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THEY BRIEFLY ABOUT A DROUGHT CLIMATE. A CLIMATE CHANGE AND IN FIRE AND THE EFFECTS THAT'S HAVING ON ON OUR FIRES THAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE. AND LITTLE BIT ABOUT FOR STEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND AND WHAT WE DO AND ARE TRYING TO DO TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. TO BEGIN WITH OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE OF THE TREE MORTALITY IS IS RELATIVELY UNPRECEDENTED. IN RECENT HISTORY OF THAT LEVEL OF MORTALITY. OBVIOUSLY THAT THE HOTTER DRIER AREAS. OR WHERE WE'RE SEEING THE GREATEST LEVEL OF MORTALITY WE'RE SEEING VEGETATION CHANGES NOW ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE THAT MAY NOT BECOME. THE RESTORED BACK TO FOREST'S THESE THESE ARE AREAS THAT MAY END UP BRUSH DOMINATED HABITATS IN GRASS. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD BUT IT'S DIFFERENT AND IT'S A CHANGE IN THE WILDLIFE POPULATIONS OUT OF THEM THAT'LL DEPEND ON THOSE SITES WILL CHANGE. AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME WATER QUALITY IMPACTS IN THOSE OTHER BENEFICIAL USES OUT WILL RELY ON THOSE THOSE AREAS. IN REGARD THE FIRE SEASON THAT WE HAD TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I THINK. ARCHER JACKSON DIDN'T AND OUTSTANDING JOB SUMMARIZING THAT'S WHY WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME RE GOING THROUGH SOME OF THOSE STATISTICS BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER CHANGES. THE RECENT. THE NEW WEATHER CHANGES THAT WE HAVE SEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MEGA FIRES IS RECALLING THEM ARE NOT. NEW IT'S THE NEW NORMAL. BUT. THE TYPES OF WEATHER THAT WE'RE SEEING AFFILIATED THAT'S DRIVING THESE FIRES AND MAKING THEM LAW LARGE AND DAMAGING. IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT WE HAD A THIRTEEN DAY SANTA ANA WIND EVENT DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN THAT LEVEL OF WIND. OVER THAT MANY DAYS CAUSING RED FLAG WARNINGS AND AND IN HISTORY. THE WIND EVENT THAT WE HAD UP UP NORTH. TOWARDS SANTA ROSA THOSE REFERRED TO AS A MOUNTAIN WAVE. I'M NOT OF NEUROLOGISTS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S A RESULT OF A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT ULTIMATELY PUSHES. THAT WIND OVER THE THE THE HILLS GOING TOWARD SANTA ROSA IS THAT NGUYEN BECOMES IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE DRAINAGE IS IT INCREASES IN WIND SPEED AND WE SAW WIND SPEEDS AND NORTHERN BAY AREA THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN. OUR SOME OF THAT THE HIGHEST WIND SPEEDS WE'VE WE'VE EVER SEEN SO. SIGNIFICANT A WIND EVENTS AFFILIATED WITH THESE FIRES. PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WHAT WERE FOCUSING. UP PROVIDING A LOT OF FOCUS ON IS TAKING A LANDSCAPE LEVEL APPROACH WE KNOW THESE FIRES ARE BURNING OUT OF OUR WILD LANDS OUT OF ARE FORCED INTO OUR CITIES SO IT'S IT'S COMPLETELY REASONABLE THAT WE WOULD TAKE A LANDSCAPE APPROACH AND TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES. COME WERE WHAT THEY WERE WORKING IN THE UPPER WATERSHEDS IN IN THE HEADWATERS AREAS CONDUCTING FORCE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SPENDING PRESCRIBED FIRE. IN THE MIDDLE WATER SHEDS WERE WERE WERE FOCUSING IN WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE SHARE AREAS OF FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AROUND OUR LOWER REACHES OF OUR WATERSHEDS WHERE WE'RE COMBINING FOR STEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES ULTIMATELY TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE. WE KNOW WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE. THE OUTCOME OF THESE FIRES THROUGH FORCE MANAGEMENT AND ENFORCED HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND FIRE PREVENTION. AND. THAT IS OUR FOCUS WERE VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE OF THESE ACTIVITIES. WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE. CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INVESTMENT OR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS TO HELP SUPPORT SOME OF THESE LANDSCAPE LEVEL ACTIVITIES AND. WE WILL CONTINUE BEING TO BE ENGAGE THEIR. IN REGARD TO HIGH FIRE RISK AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S REACHED PERMANENT CATASTROPHIC. PROPORTIONS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE ARE VERY HIGH AND FIRE RISK. IS FAR IS A WORD PERMANENCE GOES. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE FIRE ENVIRONMENT AROUND STRUCTURES THROUGH FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES WE KNOW THIS BY DOING THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE BY STRUCTURE HARDENING BY ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE DO IN FRE PREVENTION. HOT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT ULTIMATELY CREATES HOMES AND COMMUNITIES. IN A MORE SAFE CONDITION AND CAN REDUCE THE FIRE RISK AFFILIATED WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND CAL FIRE TOUCH ON FIRE PREVENTION. WHETHER IT'S OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES REDUCING FUELS PRESCRIBED FIRE FARTHER DOWN THE WATERSHEDS WHAT WE'RE DOING. MORE FIRE ENGINEERING IN COMMUNITIES. FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDING THE LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCILS DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ALL OF THIS THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE TOUCH ON SOME COMPONENT OF FIRE PREVENTION SO. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A THAT APARTMENT AND AND WHAT ROLE WE HAVE BEEN FIRE PREVENTION. IT'S VERY MUCH WHAT WE DO IT'S NOT JUST THE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE FIRE IT'S DURING THE FIRE IMPOSE FIRE IT'S VERY MUCH A CYCLE THAT WE USE TO ANALYZE AND CONTINUALLY MONITOR FIRE CONDITIONS. AS THEY EXIST WE USE IT AND PLANNING DURING A GOING FIRE AND WE ALSO USE IT IN OUR FOLLOW UP WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH WATER BY WATERSHED EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS AS WELL AS DAMAGE ASSESSMENT GOING INTO AREAS. DETERMINING WHAT THE MEDICATIONS WERE ON THOSE HOMES THAT WERE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED AND AND AND ULTIMATELY ANALYING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE MEDICATIONS. IN THE CONTEXT OF INSURANCE. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS FOCUSED ON ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO OR SO WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE. SOME OF THE COUNTY CONSTITUENTS OR THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES HAD COME FORWARD AND RECOGNIZED OR OR VOICED A CONCERN THAT SOME OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS WERE HAVING TO CHALLENGES WITH INSURANCE. WE SAW AND AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE STRUCTURE AND THAT IT PROVIDES FOR COMMUNICATION. AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO COME TOGETHER. OBVIOUSLY IT'S BASED ON THE INSTANT INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE THE SAME STRUCTURE WE USE FOR ANY WILDLAND INCIDENT CAN BE USED ANYWHERE NAY EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT INCIDENT. WE WANTED TO CREATE A NEUTRAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WE COULD COME TOGETHER WEEK EVERYBODY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX TO. SOMETIMES CAN BE A LITTLE BIT STRESSED. TOPIC BUT WE WANTED TO GIVE EVERYONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND COME TOGETHER SO VERY QUICKLY WHAT WE DID IS ORGANIZED A WORKSHOP TO WHERE WE BROUGHT ALL OF THE. REPRESENTATIVES FROM INSURANCE INDUSTRIES. DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WAS A GREAT SUPPORT WITHOUT BOND OTHER ENTITIES THAT WERE INTERESTED IN COMING TO THE TABLE AND REALLY EDUCATING OURSELVES ON WHAT SOME OF THE INSURANCE ISSUES WERE. FROM THAT WE WE REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A NEED TO FOCUS MORE DIRECTLY ON INSURANCEAND SO. WE CREATED AN INSURANCE SUB GROUP AND I SHOULD SAY THAT UNDER THE TREE MORTALITY THE REGULATIONS WORKING GROUP WHICH I AM THE CO CHAIR. ESTABLISH TO THE THE SUBGROUP OR THE INSURANCE GROUP UNDERNEATH. YOU KNOW LARGELY WE WANTED EDUCATE OURSELVES WE WANTED TO TRY TO FRAME UP. OF WHAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE CONCERNS REALLY WERE AND THEN WE WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT WE WERE REFERRING TO WAS A NON REGULATORY SOLUTION. THIS WAS LARGELY BECAUSE WE FELT THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT CHANGING STATUTE OR LAW CHANGES THE DYNAMIC OF THE COMMUNICATION WE WANTED TO REALLY EDUCATE OURSELVES ON WHAT THE ISSUES WERE. I THINK WE'RE VERY EFFECTIVE AT THAT. I THINK IT'S BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY WE QUICKLY SIDE DISCONNECT BETWEEN. ON THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OR THE FIRE PREVENTION PRACTICES A DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT WE WOULD CREATE AROUND HOMES AND HOW THE USING THAT INFORMATION. ESSENTIALLY THE RISK MODELS RELYING ON VEGETATION SLOW OPEN ACCESS THAT VEGETATION COMPONENT DOESN'T ALLOW OR DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE SURFACE IN LATTER FUEL REDUCTION THAT WE COMMONLY REQUIRE UNDER DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLEARING. DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AS AS TO MISTER JONES INDICATED THE FUEL BREAKS AROUND COMMUNITIES. SO WE WE SAW THERE BOTH A DISCONNECT IN AN OPPORTUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY SO THAT IF WE COULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR LANDOWNERS HOMEOWNERS TO CREATE THIS DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND IT MIGHT BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE FIRE RISK THAT'S AN HAD DEVELOPED FOR THEIR PROPERTY. THAT MIGHT BE A WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY AND SO THAT'S THE ROAD WE STARTED GOING DOWN. OUT WE DEVELOPED A TIERED RISK MODEL WHICH IS A. A WILDFIRE. INSURANCE MODEL AGAIN IN COOPERATION WITH THE INSURANCE SUB GROUP THAT INVOLVED ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES. AND ULTIMATELY. WHAT WE CAME UP WITH WAS A THREE TIERED APPROACH? THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF COMPLIANCE AND AND RISK AFFILIATED WITH STRUCTURES THE FIRST BEING MORE SPECIFIC TO DEFENSIBLE SPACE THE NEXT THE NEXT LAYER THE NEXT. LEVEL BEING DEFENSIBLE SPACE PLUS ADDITIONAL WHAT WE CALL STRUCTURE HARDENING. THESE ARE BUILDING CODES. THESE ARE BUILDING MATERIALS SUCH AS A DECK MATERIAL CITING THAT ARE LESS COMBUSTIBLE AND THEN THE THIRD BEING. ALL THREE OF THOSE COMBINED INTO ONE. INCLUDING ADDITIONAL STRUCTURE HARDENING. MEDICATIONS AND SO THIS WAS. THAT CONCEPT IN A MODEL THAT WE PUT TOGETHER A WE WE'VE DEVELOPED IT INTO A RIGHT A WHITE PAPER IT'S CURRENTLY IN DRAFT FORM. AND. THE HOPE IS THAT WE. FINALIZE THAT DRAFT AND BRING IT TO THE FULL TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE FROM THE RATE THEY INSURANCE SUB GROUP HERE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. AND SO. I JUST WANNA. AGAIN THANK ALL THE FOLKS THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH THE INSURANCE SUB GROUP AND THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE IT'S BEEN A HUGE LEARNING EXPERIENCE SAYS MOST OF US ARE NOT INSURANCE EXPERTS AND. AGAIN I WANT TO TAKE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FOR THEIR EFFORTS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE EXPERTS IN AND HAVE BEEN A GREAT SUPPORT IN THAT EFFORT SO THANK YOU. VERY MUCH AND. AND NOW IT'S TIME TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS. I'VE I'VE GOT A COUPLE IN IF A CENTER MORE LOCKER. SENATOR RURAL THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ANYONE HAS ANY. FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE I KNOW DURING THE FOUGHT DURING THE THOMAS FAR BOTH IN VENTURA AND THEN WHEN IT MOVED TO ONE SETO INCENTIVE I RECOUNT ISSUE AND YOUR STAFF HAVE BEEN. EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT A GREAT DEAL OF OUR ABILITY TO WORK THROUGH THIS. AS A COMMUNITY HAS BEEN IS RUDE ASSAULT OF YOUR EFFORTS SO I WON A PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M I'M CURIOUS WHAT KIND OF COMPLAINTS SUPPORT THEMES ARE YOU HEARING FROM A. RESIDENTS ARE CONSUMERS FROM THE VARIOUS FIRE DISASTER AREAS. SO WE HAVE. AS OF. THE PRIVATELY THIS DAY. RECEIVED RETURN SEVENTY FIVE MORE FORMAL COMPLAINTS. ARE RELATING TO THE OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES HAS BEEN ABOUT. ANOTHER HUNDRED OR SO ASSOCIATE WITH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES. THE LION SHARE OF THOSE COMPLAINTS OR CLAIMS RELATED. THEY ARE. COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE CLAIMS PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE I'M VERY EARLY ON. WE STARTED RECEIVING COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS ABOUT HAVING TO FILL OUT. A VERY DETAILED PERSONAL PROPERTY INVENTORIES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A ALL OF ONE'S PERSONAL CONTENTS COVERAGE. AND THE COMPLAINT WAS THAT I LOST EVERYTHING. I KNOW I HAD MORE STUFF THAN WHAT THE COVERAGE LIMIT IS. IT'S ALREADY PAINFUL ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE NOT GOT A DOCUMENT EVERYTHING I OWNED IN LOSS IS JUST TOO MUCH. AND WE WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THAT OF COURSE I DON'T. HAVE THE AUTHORITY THE LEGISLATION I CAN MEET AUTHORITY DECORATIVE WAIVE THAT REQUIREMENT IN THE INSURANCE CONTRACT BUT I DID. ISSUE A FORMAL REQUEST TO THE INSURERS ASKING THAT THEY OF. PROVIDE UP TO HUNDRED PERCENT TO PERSONAL CONTENTS COVERAGE WITHOUT IN INVENTORY. MOST OF THE INSURERS AGREED TO GO TO LEASE FIFTY PERCENT QUITE A FEW OF GOING TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT SOME OF THE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. SO. THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE CLAIMS HANDLING COMPLAINTS. BOB THERE ARE SOMEA RATING AND UNDERWRITING ISSUES THAT WE'RE HEARING AS WELL. CONCERNS ABOUT RATES THAT THEY WERE PAID ON THE UNDERWRITING SIDE CONCERNS ABOUT UNDER INSURANCE. AND HERE OF COURSE YOU'RE A VERY FAMILIAR BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED IN THIS. COMMITTEE BEFORE ABOUT AT SOME LENGTH. I DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE INSURERS TO ENSURE PEOPLE TO THE REPLACEMENT COST. OTHERS NO STATUTE THAT REQUIRES INSURERS TO. ANNUALLY PROVIDE A POLICY HOLDERS WITH THE REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE. THE BEST I WAS ABLE TO DO IN TWENTY ELEVEN WEST ISSUE A REGULATION. THAT PROVIDED THAT WHEN REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE IS PROVIDED TO A POLICY HOLDER THAT IS OF PARTICULAR COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGY USED AS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT FOUND IN THE WAKE OF THE OAKLAND HILLS OF SAN DIEGO FIRES. WITH THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE UNDER INSURED BECAUSE ENSURE HAD LEFT OUT IN THE REPLACEMENT COST CALCULATION AN IMPORTANT AGREED IT. THAT MAYBE THEY'D USE LABOR COSTS FROM A DIFFERENT MARKET ARE LEFT OUT PERMITTING FEES OR ZONING UPGRADES OR EVEN MATERIAL COSTS. SO TWENTY ELEVEN BY PROMULGATED REGULATION THE SAID IF YOU PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE. THAT TO A POLICY HOLDER HERE'S THE. COMPREHENSIVE CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY AFTER YEARS OF FOR MY GOOD EFFORTS I WAS SUED BY THE ENTIRE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION A SEE I SEE INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES SEVEN YEAR LEGAL BATTLE WE PREVAILED IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. THE REGULATION WAS UPHELD NINE RESOUNDINGLY SO AND A SEVEN NO DECISION BY A JUDGE JUSTICE APPOINTED BY BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS. HOWEVER. THAT REGULATION WAS IN PLACE DURING THE ENTIRETY THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE WERE SUCCESSFUL BEATING BACK AN INJUNCTIVE ORDER. OF BLOCKING THE REGULATION SO ONE OF THE INQUIRIES THAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING THAT BASED ON COMPLAINTS IS. YOU KNOW DID THE INSURER FOLLOW THE REPLACEMENT COST REGULATION A WHEN THEY GAVE ME THE REPLACEMENTCOST US BUT NOW NOT EVERYBODY ASKS FOR REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE. OF MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T A SOME PEOPLE BOUGHT THEIR INSURANCE MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE THE REGULATION WAS IN PLACE AND JUST DID AN ANNUAL UPDATE GOT A MODEST INCREASE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WITHOUT REALLY SITTING DOWN AND LOOKING AT THE REPLACEMENT COST OF THEIR HOME. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES. BUT I ANTICIPATE AS THE CLAIMS PROCESS WINDS ON UNDER INSURANCE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A GROWING ISSUE. AND SO. WE HAVE. RECOMMENDATIONS I IN A SEPARATE BILL PACKAGE THAT'S MOVING CALLED THE WILD FIRE SURVIVORS BLUEPRINT BILL PACKAGE THAT MEMBERS. IN THE AREAS AFFECTED BY THE FIRES OF INTRODUCED AND OUT SEVERAL OF THOSE BILLS INCLUDING ONE CARRIED BY SENATOR BILL DIED GO TO THE QUESTION OF. A REPLACEMENT COST REQUIRING AN ANNUAL REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE TO GET BE GIVEN. REQUIRING AN UPDATE THE AND IN SOME CASES REQUIRING ADDITIONAL COVERAGE SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN THE CASE OF A NATURAL DISASTER CRITICS OF ITS CLAIMS COURT CLAIMS ISSUES IN UNDERWRITING ISSUES ARE. ARE GENERALLY THAT MEANS OF QUESTIONS WERE GETTING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER QUESTIONS SO THE SENATOR GLAZER IN AND A CENTER MONNING. EXCUSE ME SOME SENATOR MORE LOCK BEGAN WITH THE NAM ON COME CLOSE. GO AHEAD SENATOR MOORE LA. CHAIR AS COMMISSIONER JONES. I WE WERE GIVEN A MUCH MATERIAL AND ON PAGE. FOR THE FIRST PARAGRAPH STARTS OFF WITH THE SENTENCE. INSURERS COMPLAINED THEY HAVE TO FILE RATE PLANS BASED ON. PAST LOS EXPERIENCE. DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU. HAVE TO REVIEW WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES WHAT. RATES THEY CAN CHARGE. I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS PERCHANCE GOT. THIS THIS. HANDOUT THAT WAS PROVIDED TO AROUND HANDOUT THAT WAS COMMITTEE ANALYSIS YEAH. PAGE FOUR OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. BROWN'S SORRY CENTER FIRST FULL PARAGRAPH UP BY YOUR LEFT THUMB IT. INSURERS COMPLAIN YEAH SO. THIS WAS PREPARED BY THE COMMITTEE. IT'S A VERY. THOROUGH AND DETAILED ANALYSIS. IT IS THE CASE. THAT THE THE VOTERS ENACTED PROP ONE OF THREE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A WHICH PROVIDES THAT INSURERS HAVE TO JUSTIFY THEIR RATES. IF THEIR PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE. IN THE WAY THEY DO THAT IS BY SUBMITTING THEIR RATES TO THE DEPARTMENT. THEY SUBMIT THEIR EXPERIENCE IN LOS DATA THAT THEY SUBMIT THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THEY IDENTIFY. SOME AMOUNT OF. RETURN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE. THEN WE APPLY VERY DETAILED REGULATORY ONLY BASED. RAINN FACTORS IN DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS DETERMINE WHAT WHAT THE RATE SHOULD BE. INCREASINGLY INSURERS ARE USING A FORWARD LOOKING PREDICTIVE MODELS I MENTION THESE WILD FIRE. I RISK MODELS THEY'RE BEING USED BOTH FOR UNDERWRITING AND RATING. AND I ANTICIPATE THAT HIM OF RAPE FILINGS WE'RE GOING TO SEE. ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INCREASES BASED ON THAT THESE MOST RECENT LOSSES BY AS WELL AS. INDICATIONS OF WHAT THESE MODELS ARE PREDICTING GOING FOR. I THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME OF PROP ONE OF THREE. WHAT YEAR WAS THAT OPPOSE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THEN? I'M REMINDED BY MY CHIEF DEPUTY MISTER LAU SURE WHO I WAS REMISS IN NOT INTRODUCING EARLIER. THAT. THE RATE DEVELOPMENT FACTORS ALSO INCLUDE WHAT'S CALLED A THAT CATASTROPHE LOADER CATASTROPHE FACTOR AND WHAT THAT IS IS THAT'S WHERE THE INSURERS CAN PUT. IN INCREMENTS OF RATE THAT THEY BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH CATASTROPHES LIKE THE ONE THAT HAS OCCURRED HERE AND SO THERE IS A A COMPONENT OF RATE DEVELOPMENT. AT THAT A CONTEMPLATES. RATING BASED ON CATASTROPHIC EVENTS LIKE THE ONE THAT OCCURRED HERE. DO YOU ALSO REVIEW THEIR INCOME STATEMENTS HUMAN OR INCOME TAX RETURNS AND THEIR BALANCE SHEETS FINANCIAL AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO. MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT. CHARGING TOO MUCH THEN IS AT PAR THE PROCESS WELL WE WE. WE LOOK AT THE RATES AT THE FILE. WE LOOK AT OTHER A FINANCIAL INFORMATION. BUT WE ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE COMPANIES ARE ADEQUATELY RESERVING TO PAY FUTURE CLAIMS. AND SO WE DO A LOOK AT THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN PARTICULAR BY THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES AND WE LOOK AT THEIR RESERVES HAS MATCHED AGAINST THEIR LIABILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC EVENT LIKE THIS ONE. THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY RESERVE TO BE ABLE TO PAY CLAIMS AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS A. AN ENORMOUS AND DEVASTATING. SERIES OF OF OF THE CATASTROPHES TWELVE OVER TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL LOSSES ACCOUNTING. THAT OBVIOUSLY FALLS ON DEFERRED INSURERS IN DIFFERENT WAYS GIVEN THEIR DEGREE OF EXPOSURE SOME INSURERS ARE HAVING MORE OF THAT LOST SOME LAST. BUT WE ARE. FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT BASED ON OUR WORK. MAKING SURE THAT COMPANIES ARE ADEQUATELY RESERVED THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PAY THOSE CLAIMS. THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT RESERVES TO PAY THE CLAIMS. WE WERE GIVING UP YET SHEET THAT SHOWS THAT FROM NINETY ONE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE NUMBER OF INSURANCE COMPANIES HAS GONE FROM A HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE DOWN TO HUNDRED AND SEVEN. AND SO I'M WONDERING WHAT PROP ONE A THREE BE PART OF THE PROVINCES THAT PASSED IN EIGHTY EIGHT. IT RECEIVED FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE INSURERS JUST LEAVE THE STATE. OR WAS IT MERGERS OR WAS IT ACTUAL BANKRUPTCIES WELL I I I'VE I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF PAPER IN HIS SOURCE BUT. THERE. IT'S YOURS YEAH. IT'S MINE. GREAT. WELL THAT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR ME TO DISAVOW IT ISN'T IT. YEAH. I GUESS I AM FAMILIAR WITH IT. BUT WHAT WHAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME ARE. SERIES OF CONSOLIDATIONS IN MERGERS OF COMPANIES. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR EXPLAINING THAT THAT NUMBER. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO. WE WERE SUCCESSFUL UNDER MY COMMISSIONER SHIPPAN AS GETTING ALL STATE TO RETURN BACK TO THE MARKET AFTER HE'D PULLED OUT ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THAT WAS A BIG. THAT WAS A BIG PLUS BUT THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY GENERALLY. I'M A FAIR PLAN. IT THAT'S AN INSURANCE COMPANY ITSELF RIGHT WOULD DO WE HAVE A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT FOR THAT NOW DO WE. DO THE. THE BALANCE SHEET INCOME STATEMENT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH RESERVES. SO. MORE PRECISELY IN A IN I DIDN'T SAY THIS IN MY REMARKS BECAUSE A READING OF TIME A. THE FAIR PLAY AND THE FAIR PLAN. THE FAIR PLAN NOW IS ACTUALLY INNOCENT USUALLY TO TAKE CARE DINNER WILL STICKERS FOR AYE AYE FOR DINNER. I WAS TRYING TO BE MINDFUL BUT THE BUT THE FAIR FLED. THE FAIR PLAN IS ACTUALLY. IN ASSOCIATION AND ALL OF THE WRITERS OF PROPERTY INSURANCE PARTICIPATE IN IT. HITS STATUTORILY. CREATED A IT IS REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT WE PERFORM THE SAME. RATE REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL SOLVENCY REVIEW FOR IT AS WE PERFORM FOR. THE REST OF THE ADMITTED THAT COMMERCIAL MARKET. LIKE A JPA. I YEAH I GUESS I MEAN I THINK IT'S IT I I GUESS TOO I WOULD THINK OF IT IS A. CONSORTIUM OF ALL OF THE PRIVATE A CONCERT YOU COOPER CONSORTIUM OF ALL THE PRIVATE CARRIERS STATEMENT TO IT RIGHT YES ABSOLUTELY IT AS A SEPARATE LEGAL EXISTENCE ABSOLUTELY NO I GET THAT. I'M YOU CAN GET IT FROM THE FAIR PLAN. OKAY SO THERE'S THAT YOU HAVE A WEB PAGE THAT HAS FAIR PLAN THERE THERE IS AN ENTITY CALLED THE FAIR PLAN THEY HAVE AWAY PAGE THEY HAVE A DIRECTOR SHE'S A VERY NICE LADY SHE'S TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THE PAST. THE AND AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN STAFF IN THEIR OWN LEGAL EXISTENCE AND YOU CAN CERTAINLY GET OUT IF IT IS UNDER RESERVE TO WHO BANKS SET UP. WELL I IF THEY WERE UNDER RESERVE WHICH WE DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE THEN WE WOULD SAY T THEM YOU'VE GOT TO RAISE YOUR RATES TO. GATHER MORE RATE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT RESERVES. IF IF IN EXTREMISTS. THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE COLLECTING INSUFFICIENT RATE IN ORDER TO COVER LOSSES THAN THEY CAN TIE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE. OF THE CONSORTIUM. BUT WE HAVE NO INDICATION CURRENTLY THAT THEY'RE UNDER RESERVED. THANK YOU OUR A WILL QUIT WERE. NOW BEEN WELL OVER AN HOUR AND I BELIEVE THAT SHOULD THE CHAIR. QUESTION. ALL ONE QUESTION IF YOU WOULD THEN WE CAN MOVE ON. IT RELATES THE SAME DOCUMENT ON PAGE FOUR. I'LL JUST MAKE ONE QUESTION BUT IT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND FULL PARAGRAPH INSURERS HAVE ACCESS TO BRUSH MAPPING PROGRAMS. BRIMMING WITH DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION CAL FIRE. U. S. FOR SERVICE AND THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION. BUT CAL FIRE SPIN EIGHT YEARS BEHIND IN DOING BUYER MAPS IN. THE CAT CAME UP AS A RESULT OF THE FIRES A NAP IN CINEMA EVEN IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THERE'S AND WHERE THE FIRE MAPS. SOME WONDER WHAT'S THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND YOU. IS INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF EXPERTS GAP SHOWS THAT. THE INDUSTRY'S BUILDING SOME INCREDIBLE MAPS AND I'M JUST WONDERING. WHERE'S THE COOPERATION WORKERS. SOME KIND OF COLLABORATION. OF BECAUSE I I'VE I'VE GOT A OF WILDFIRES OWN IN MY DISTRICT IN ITS RATED LOW AND I LOST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOMES THERE. IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. IN THAT ON IT AND THAT'S THE ALL OVER ALL THE COUNTRIES IN QUESTION WITH MAYBE SOME FOLLOW UPS BUT THAT'S I SUSPECTED TO HAVE A QUICK RESPONSE THINK THE QUESTION IS THAT THE THERE'S TO THE SUGGESTION THAT THE CAL FIRES ABOUT EIGHT YEARS BEHIND IN TERMS OF DRAWING ITS. MAPS WE'RE DOING ITS. IT'S WORKED PRETTY OF A RESPONSE TO ME I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I YOU KNOW I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHAT MAPS THEY'RE REFERRING TO HEAR I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR ON THAT. IF WE'RE TALKING FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE MAPS. WE'RE TALKING BRUSH MAPS YOU KNOW I'M I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR ON WHAT WHAT MAPS THEY'RE REFERRING TO. WE YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S THERE'S A NEED TO UPDATE OUR MAPS AND AND WE'RE WORKING TO. YOU KNOW CONTINUALLY WORKING TO MAKE THOSE UPDATES DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUGH THAT IS FAR AS THE MAPSCO THAT I'M I'M TALKING THE CONTEXT OF FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. WE RECENTLY. WERE WORKING WITH CPUC ON SOME OTHER MAPS AT THE CPC IS ACTUALLY ADOPTED AT THIS POINT AND THOSE ARE COMPLETE SO. I GUESS I WOULD NEED A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH WITH. THE COMMITTEE AND AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN IN IN HELPING TO A GETS MORE CLARITY SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT WE GET YOU THAT INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS I'M SURE CENTER MORE LOCK WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE SO WE WERE ON THE SAME PAGE TALK ABOUT THE SAME MAPS. THAT SENATOR GLAZER HAD A QUESTION. YEAH. COULD ASSURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR BEING OUT AND ABOUT AND ENGAGE IN THESE COMMUNITIES WHERE THESE DISASTERS OF STRUCK I KNOW IT'S A. IT'S A TRAUMATIC TIME FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED AND I THINK YOU BEING THERE AND CONNECTING WITH THEM IS VERY MEANINGFUL I APPRECIATE THE EXTRA EFFORT THAT YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT HAVE ENGAGED IN TO. TO TRY TO BRING COMFORTED AND VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION. AND YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SOME MORE DATA ON LOSSES. AND I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THAT IN TERMS OF. WHEREBY YOU HAVE AVAILABLE NOW AND WHAT WHAT MORE YOU WOULD BE SEEKING. SO I THINK WHAT WERE WHAT WERE INTERESTED IN. IN OUR OUR PROPOSAL. IS. THAT I'D COLLECTING MORE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO LOS EXPERIENCE. AND THEN BEING ABLE TO USE THAT. IN A MORE SPECIFIC WAY FOR PURPOSES OF RATING. SO WHAT WOULD OCCURS THE IN SOME CASES WITH SOME. CARRIERS RATE DEVELOPMENT IS THEY MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE. AN OF CREDIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT I TO USE AN ACTUARIAL TERM. IN THEIR OWN. RATINGS OF INSURANCE TO BE ABLE TO. PREDICT AS WELL AS THEY MIGHT WHAT THE FUTURE LOSSES MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITING IN HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS SO THEY THEN USE OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE PUT TOGETHER BY THIRD PARTIES THAT COLLECT THIS DATA. AND YOU KNOW BY AND LARGE AS LONG AS IT'S A CREDIBLE WILL ALLOW THAT BUT WE THINK. THAT BE SOME REAL BENEFIT IN ARE COLLECTING MORE DETAILED A LOS EXPERIENCE DATA ACROSS THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA MARKET IS SO SHE WOULD WILD FIRES. SO THAT. WE WOULD THEN HAVE THAT AVAILABLE AND COULD MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO CARRIERS TO DO A MORE REFINED. A JOBLESS RATE DEVELOPMENT THAT SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA IF THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO RATES OF THEY'RE STILL THEY'RE STILL WRITING IN HIGH RISK FIRE IS MAYBE NOT A WHOLE LOT THEY HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF LOSSES. SO WHEN THEY DEVELOP THEIR RATES THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH A DATA POINTS TO HAVE CREDIBLE EXPERIENCE SO THEN THEY. USE EXPERIENCE FROM THESE OTHER SOURCES AND SOME OF THESE OTHER SOURCES. MAY NOT BE CALIFORNIA'S SPECIFIC. AND MAY NOT BE AS. ROBUST TO REFINE THE DATA SAID AS WE THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ATTACK OBTAINED BY ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE DATA. IF I IF I SAID ANYTHING WRONG YOU CAN CORRECT ME BUT. I THINK THAT'S THE GIST OF IT THE AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TYPICALLY DONE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ASSESSING THEIR. THEIR RATES THE RATES THEY'RE PROPOSING WELL AGAIN WHAT'S DIFFERENT WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS. THERE ARE SOME NUMBER OF CARRIERS WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE AND ARE USING THIRD PARTY DATA SETS TIGHTER AND YEAH WHAT IS THAT THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN LAST YEAR. AND THE YEAR BEFORE IN OTHER WORDS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S DONE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF YOUR A REVIEWER. WELL WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT IT IS THAT WE BE COLLECTING AT ONE TIME. CARRIES DON'T COME IN EVERY YEAR THEY MAY COME IN YEAR ONE LINE AND THAT CAN THAT NOT COMING FOR RATE FILING TO YEAR FOUR. AND SO IT SORT OF ALL OVER THE PLACE AND SO WE HAVE BITS OF DATA FOR DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME. WE HAVE DATA THAT SPECIFIC TO PARTICULAR CARRIERS BUT WE DON'T WE HAVE A COLLECTED IN ONE PLACE ALL THE DATA FOR A GIVEN YEAR. THAT WOULD LET US HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE AND THAT WE COULD THEN USE AND FRANKLY THE CARRIERS COULD USE TO DO AND I AND I SUSPECT I MEAN THE BENEFIT OF THIS TO THE CARRIAGE FRANKLY IS FOR THOSE CARRIERS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT WRITING MORE HIGH. RISK FIRES BECAUSE IN A LOT EXPERIENCE THERE THIS DATA SAID COULD PROVIDE MORE COMFORT TO SOME OF THEM. WERE LEASE FOR COMFORT WITH REGARD TO WHAT THE APPROPRIATE PRICING IS TO ENABLE THEM TO WRITE IN THOSE AREAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT MORE. WE WILL COVER SOME OF THE. ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN SOME OF THE SUBSEQUENT. CANDLES AND I JUST WANT TO AGAIN THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND STAFF AND. LOW CAL FIRE. WE REALLY ARE ASKING A LOT OF FEW BUT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA DESERVE BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT AND THE ANSWERS AND AND IMPROVEMENTS GOING FORWARD SO PRE SHAVE YOUR TIME AND YOUR THINKING THAT HERE LEADERSHIP THANK YOU THANKS A LOT. THANK YOU. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO BRING UP A WHAT WE'RE CALLING VIEW FROM THE FRONT LINES SOME OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE STACI HEATON. A RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA FEUD COME FORWARD JEFF CARMEN. FIRE CHIEF FOR CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT AND DAN WAVED OF UNITED POLICY HOLDERS IF YOU COULD. COME FORWARD AND. I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO TRY WITH A STRAIGHT FACE TO ASK YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO FIVE MINUTES EACH. LETS SEE WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH HERE A IN THAT. AMOUNT OF TIME THEY WILL OPEN IT UP FOR SOME QUESTIONS. SHOULD WE START WITH THE STATE'S HEATON. AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON AND THAT I WANT TO THANK BOTH THE TEARS FOR THE INVITATION TODAY APPRECIATE IT. I AM STACEY HEATON WITH THE MIAMI. I SHOULD BE ON A TRY TO TALK A LITTLE LOUDER. I AND STACEY HE IN WITH THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA RC RC WE REPRESENT THIRTY FIVE RURAL COUNTIES STATEWIDE. WE ALSO REPRESENT EIGHT OF THE TEN HIGH HAZARD COUNTIES FOR TREEMORTALITY THERE ARE INVOLVED IN THE TO MORTALITY TASK FORCE. WE'VE ALSO KIND OF ADOPTED KERN AND FRESNO IN THE PROCESS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT MEMBERS OF HIS HERE SEE BECAUSE WE WORK SO CLOSELY WITH THEM ON THE ATTY MTF. AND I'M RCR SEES REPRESENTATIVE ON THE TO MORTALITY TASK FORCE AS WELL AS ON THE FORCE CLIMATE ACTION TEAMS SO. THAT WERE PRETTY INVOLVED IN SOME OF THESE ISSUES RC RC CONTAINS A LOT OF CALIFORNIA'S FORESTED LANDS INCLUDING MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF. AT THE STATE'S NATIONAL FOREST LANDS SO AS YOU MIGHT GUESS WE'VE DEALT WITH A LOT OF WILD FIRE ISSUES AND. THE RECENT PAST. NO THE RIM FIRE THE KING FIRE THE VALLEY FIRE THE BUTTE FIRE I COULD GO ON BUT YOU PROBABLY WOULD PREFER THAT I NOT. SO THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WITH INSURANCE POLICIES CANCELLATIONS ON RENEWALS ARE NOT EXACTLY NEW. TO OUR. MEMBERSHIP AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THEM FOR YOU KNOW THEN THE BETTER PART OF THIS DECADE. BUT AS THE TRUE MORTALITY EMERGENCY CAME AND GOT MORE SERIOUS WE STARTED HEARING ABOUT THE MORE FREQUENTLY. ESPECIALLY DOWN IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SIERRA US AND SO. IN THE TASK FORCE OF AFFORDED US AS A MATTHEW REISMAN ALLUDED TO A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY SERVE DIG DOWN INTO THIS ISSUE. NOW A COUPLE THINGS I WANTED TO US FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVES. ARE TWO THINGS IN MIND BEING A THE FIRST BEING THE WORD AFFORDABILITY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET. IF YOU LOOK AT APPENDIX C.. FOR THE UC COMMISSIONER'S REPORT WHICH WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE COUNTIES ON THE TASK FORCE. YOU'LL SEE THAT BY ALL THE COUNTIES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE WITH DWELLINGS IN THE. VERY HIGH. FIRE RISK ZONES ADD THAT HAVE THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THEIR HOMES. IN THOSE ZONES ARE MORE. ARE ALL OUR SHARES THE MEMBER COUNTIES. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE COUNTIES THERE ALSO ALL. LARGELY LOW INCOME COMMUNITY COUNTIES. IF YOU GO BY THE DEFINITION UNDER AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THOSE COUNTIES HAVE VERY LARGE SWATHS OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COUNTIES LIKE TRINITY AND LAKE AND SIERRA AND. CAN YOU MONO AND MARIPOSA. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE A HOMEOWNER THAT'S BEING COUNSELOR NON RENEWED AND THEY'RE GOING OUT LOOKING FOR THEIR COVERAGE. AND THEIR HAVING TO GO TO A POLICY THAT IS UP TO TWICE AS MUCH AS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN PAYING. IT'S COVERAGE. BUT IS IT AFFORDABLE AND SUSTAINABLE NO PROBABLY NOT. AND SO IT'S ALSO NOT JUST AN ISSUE OUT IN THE STICKS AS WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT WHERE THE FIRE RISK AREAS ARE. WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOMEOWNERS IN PLACES LIKE AUBURN WHERE THEY ARE WITHIN A MILE OR TWO OF A FIRE STATION ACROSS THE STREET FROM A FIRE HYDRANT. I GET CANCELED A NON RENEWED BECAUSE THEY'RE IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREA. SO IT NEEDS ARE NOT THESE ARE BECOMING MORE COMMON ITS NOT UNIQUE TO THOSE FOLKS OUT IN THE REMOTE AREAS. AND AS WE SEE THE SORTS OF HIGH SEVERITY CATASTROPHIC. DAMAGING WILDFIRES EXPAND OUT INTO AREAS SUCH AS SENATOR JACKSON'S DISTRICT. WE FEAR THE EXPANSION OF THE CANCELLATIONS ARE NOT RENTALS. AND SO WELL AFFORDABILITY IS A GREAT CONCERN WE ALSO HAVE ONE OTHER GREAT CONCERN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND THAT BEING. OR THE. THAT CONCERN OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO. HAVE THE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES HOMES THAT CAN GET INSURANCE COVERAGE BECOME A LOT LESS VALUABLE. AND AS OUR HOME VALUES DROPPED IN OUR RURAL COUNTIES. IT. TAKES DOWN OUR OUR TAXATION. ABILITY AS WELL AND SO CAN WE PROVIDE SERVICES AT A LEVEL THAT OUR. CONSTITUENTS ARE USED TO IF WE ARE FOR PROPERTY TAXES GO DOWN. THAT WE CAN COLLECT SO THAT IS A GREAT CONCERN FOR OUR MEMBER COUNTIES AS WELL I THINK SHOULD BE FOR COUNTIES ALL OVER THE STATE THAT ARE GOING TO BE. AT DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM SO. WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO MUCH ABOUT THE TIERED RISK MODEL BECAUSE MATTHEW COVERED MOST VETS SO. HE DID MY JOB FOR ME BUT ARE COUNTIES WERE VERY INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING NOT RISK MODEL WITH A CALIFORNIA THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE. WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND HELD HANDS AND AND WHERE DEVELOPING THAT DRAFT WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF DEVELOPING A TIERED RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR HOMEOWNERS. THESE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE BEING CANCELED A NON RENEWED THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE NOT DOING THEIR DEFENSIBLE SPACE ARE NOT FIRE HURTING THEIR HOMES SOME OF THEM ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR HOMES. OUR FIRE HARDENED IN ARE PROTECTED FROM WILDFIRE. SO IF WE'D LOVE TO SEE A TERRORIST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PUT IN PLACE FOR HOMEOWNERS TO GET INSURANCE DISCOUNTS THAT WAY. AND WE ARE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MANY OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HE LAID OUT IN DURING HIS TESTIMONY. AND WE WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE BEING HELPFUL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH BOTH OF THESE COMMITTEES ON THIS AS WE GO FORWARD AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS WELL. ARE COUNTIES WANT TO BE HELPFUL WOULD LIKE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND. CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU OUT LET'S NOW GO TO A JEFF CARMEN FIRE CHIEF OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT GOOD AFTERNOON SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE I'M I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE LOCAL FIRE GOVERNMENT'S PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WE CAN REDUCE PROPERTY LOSS AND AND AND ALSO LIFE LOST. IT ONE THING WE'VE NOTICED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THE FEROCITY OF THESE FIRES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING A WHETHER YOU THINK IT'S THE NEW NORMAL NOT. WE CONTINUE TO USE A WORD YEAR AFTER YEAR THAT LIKE UNPRECEDENTED AND NEVER BEFORE SEEN SPEEDS OF THESE FIRES. AND AND AND. WE BELIEVE IT IS THE NEW NORM AND WE'VE COME TOGETHER AS LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES. LOCAL. LABOR ASSOCIATIONS MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION'S LEADER CALIFORNIA CITIES TO FORM A COALITION THIS YEAR. TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK WE CAN DO TO REDUCE THAT PROPERTY AND AND LIFE PLUS WHO OPERATING. AGAINST ALL ODDS RIGHT NOW I WILL SAY THAT MANY FIRE AGENCIES HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM THE RECESSION. MY MY ORGANIZATION CLOSE SEVEN FIRE COMPANIES IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO OPEN FOR THOSE BACKUPS OR OPERATING LIKE MOST AGENCIES WITH FEWER RESOURCES. COME IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SPEED AT WHICH THESE FIRES ARE GROWING SOMETIMES OVER AN ACRE A SECOND. WHICH IS JUST AGAIN UNPRECEDENTED. WE ARE REQUESTING AND NEEDING RESOURCES FASTER THAN EVER. AND WERE OPERATING UNDER A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THAT IS A MODEL FOR MANY STATES AND NATIONS BUT AS A MATTER FACT IS SIXTY YEARS OLD. AND IT'S A REACTIVE SYSTEM THAT SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO GET US. HELP FROM OTHER AGENCIES WITHIN TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND IT WORKED WEL IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE WAS DEVELOPED. TODAY. IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES FOR EXAMPLE THE INCIDENT COMMANDER'S THAT ARRIVED TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY STRIKE TEAMS THEY NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. AND AGENCIES LIKE MYSELF WHO HAD RESOURCES AVAILABLE OPERATING UNDER THE SIXTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM IN AN ANTIQUATED RESOURCE ORDERING MODEL. WAITED SIX HOURS TO SEND THE RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO THE NORTH BAY FIRES ABSOLUTELY. OF FOR ME UNACCEPTABLE SO IT IS YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE FORMED A COALITION. STATEWIDE AND WE'D LIKE TO CHANGE THAT SIX YEAR OLD SYSTEM FROM A PROACTIVE MODEL TO A REACTIVE MODEL ARE PREDICTIVE SERVICES IN THE STATE ARE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED PHENOMENA WE KNOW. FORTY EIGHT SEVENTY TWO HOURS IN ADVANCE WHEN A CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENT IS GOING TO A CURSE SO EVERYTHING FROM FLOODING RAINS MUD SLIDES. AND AND CERTAINLY HOT DRY WINDS WE CALL RED FLAG DAYS AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL WILL. ALLOW US ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO UPDATE OUR SYSTEM TO WHERE WE CAN. PRO ACTIVELY PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES AND THE MOST VULNERABLE AREAS WHEN THOSE CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENTS OCCUR SO INSTEAD OF OF MOBILIZING AND PUTTING TOGETHER THOSE RESOURCES AFTER IT'S DETERMINED THAT WE NEED THAT HELP ON A FIRE. A WILL PUT THOSE RESOURCES TOGETHER WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENTS AND PLACE THOSE IN THOSE VULNERABLE AREAS SO THAT WHEN THE INCIDENT COMMANDER'S NEED THE RESOURCES. THE ORDERS ALREADY BEEN PROCESSED IN THOSE RESOURCES CAN BE DISPATCHED IMMEDIATELY WE THINK IT'S THAT THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THAT WE'VE SEEN AND. YEARS OR MORE WERE HOPEFUL THAT BY DOING SO. THAT WILL REDUCE THAT PROPERTY IN LIFE LOS. TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS SYSTEM IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES. THE LOCAL AGENCIES DID NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL FINANCES TO BE ABLE TO PROACTIVELY PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES AND WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN NOTES NORTH BAY FIRES I MENTIONED EARLIER WHERE WE WAITED HOURS TO GET RESOURCES ON SCENE. JEAN FULLER ENDS IN IN VENTURA COUNTY. DOES HAVE THE ABILITY FINANCIALLY AS A CONTRACT AGENCY TO PRE DEPLOY RESOURCES AND HE UP STAFF IS ORGANIZATION. AHEAD OF THE THOMAS FIRE BY EIGHTY PERCENT AND AND ALTHOUGH THAT FIRE WAS DEVASTATING IT WAS NOT AS DEVASTATING AS THE. NORTH BAY FIRES AND WE WE. PAY A LOT OF THAT. CREDIT TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD THOSE POSITIONS THE I'M SORRY THOSE RESOURCES PRE POSITION AND READY TO GO. WERE THEY ABLE TO PUT OUT THE FIRE IN KNOW BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE RESCUES MAKE NOTIFICATIONS AHEAD OF THE FIRE AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO DIRECT REDIRECT THAT FIRE OUT OF POPULATED AREAS. AND KEEP IT INTO THE WILD LAND SO WE HAD LESS PROPERTY LOSS AND LESS LIFE LOST SO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WERE HOPING THAT THE GOVERNOR AND AND AND WITHOUT THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE ALSO WILL SEE FIT TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO ALLOW US TO PRE POSITION THOSE RESOURCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I MIGHT ALSO ADD I LEARNED VERY RECENTLY THAT BECAUSE OF PRE POSITIONING. BEFORE THE MONTICELLO MUDSLIDES THEY WERE ABLE TO RESCUE. THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE. BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR PERISHED. BUT THAT PRE POSITIONING SAVED THE LIVES OF MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. ALRIGHT. WE HAVE DAN WADE UNITED POLICY HOLDERS GOOD AFTERNOON SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAN WADE AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING UNITED POLICYHOLDERS OR YOU P. FOR SHORT. EPA IS A NONPROFIT CONSUMER EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BEEN HELPING DISASTER SURVIVORS NAVIGATE FAIR CLAIM SETTLEMENTS AND WORKING TO SOLVE. INSURANCE MARKET PROBLEM SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE STORM. KEEPING HOME INSURANCE AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR U. P.. WE PUBLISH INSURANCE SHOPPING. GUIDANCE ONLINE. AND IN PRINT. GENERALLY SPEAKING. CLIMATE CHANGE DROUGHT AND FIRE CONDITIONS ARE REDUCING COMPETITION OPTIONS AND AFFORDABILITY AND A GROWING NUMBER OF REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT SEEMS QUITE CLEAR THAT LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OVER THESE PHENOMENA ARE BEING INFLATED BY INSURERS OVERRELIANCE ON PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS OVER TRADITIONAL UNDERWRITING. WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF HOW THESE REDUCTIONS ARE IMPACTING PROPERTY OWNERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER INCREASES. AND NOT ADMITTED INSURERS MARKET SHARES BECAUSE OF FOR CNCERN GIVEN THEIR FORMS ARE AREN'T REGULATED IN THEIR POLICY HOLDERS DON'T HAVE INSOLVENCY PROTECTION. BUT WE NEED TO KNOW IS. WHICH ENSURES OUR MATERIAL MATERIALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF HOMES THEY'RE WILLING TO ENSURE AND WHERE. WHICH INSURERS ARE PICKING UP THESE NON RENEWED HOMES. HOW MANY OF THE INSURERS THAT ARE PICKING UP AN HONOR AND HOMES ARE NOT ADMITTED? WHAT DOES HAPPEN TO THE FAIR PLANTS POLICY COUNT? EXISTING LIKELY TO INCREASE PROFITS THAT WHICH INSURERS HAVE FAR VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENT IN MITIGATION SUPPORT AND REWARD PROGRAMS. PATTERNS OF NON JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN A CONSISTENT LARGELY TEMPORARY PROBLEM FOR SURVIVORS IN THEIR MORE FORTUNATE NEIGHBORS AFTER MANY CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. HE PEERS PARTICIPATED IN CREATING SOLUTIONS WE PUBLISHED DROPPED BY OUR HOME ENSURE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE TO GO FOR HELP. I FREQUENTLY DOWNLOADED ITEM IN OUR ONLINE CLAIM HELP LIBRARY. WE HELPED CRAFT INNOVATIONS INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS THE NINETEEN NINETY TO MATCH UP PROGRAM WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND THAT CONNECTED HOMEOWNERS WITH AGENTS. AND BROKERS THAT WITH THE MAURICE AND OUR MORE RECENT VERSION OF THAT PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE FINDER YAFFA COPIA TOOL. NO LESS FEARS YOU PIECE BEEN CALLED UPON TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND ATTENTION TO THE HOME INSURANCE AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS IN THE STATE. HOMEOWNERS IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF REGIONS ARE HAVING A HARDER TIME FINDING REPLACEMENT COVERAGE OPTIONS WHEN THEY'RE NON RENEWED BUT I'M SURE THAT MANY CASES THEY'VE PATRONIZE FOR DECADES. WELL THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM IS UNKNOWN WE WANT TO GET AHEAD OF IT BEFORE IT BECOMES A FULL BLOWN CRISIS. WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT GROWTH IN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET WHERE THE POLICY FORMS ARE UNREGULATED THE INSURERS ARE NOT BACKED BY THE CALIFORNIAN CHURNS GUARANTY ASSOCIATION. AND WE BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN SHOULD REMAIN AS INTENDED. THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT. OUR MIND MAIN PRIORITIES ARE AS FOLLOWS. FIRST TO MAINTAIN STABILITY IN ORDER AND PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKETS AND PREVENT PRICE GOUGING. SECOND. BUT CONSUMERS CONTEND WITH AFFORDABILITY AVAILABILITY MITIGATION FINANCING CHALLENGES AND THIRD. INSURER SHOULD BE PARTNERING WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL GUIDANCE AND HELP WITH MITIGATION INCLUDING APPROPRIATE RATE REDUCTIONS AND INCENTIVES FOR RISK REDUCTION. WE SPENT OVER YEAR WORKING WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES INSURANCE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO GET AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF NON RENEWALS AND REPLACEMENT POLICIES. THE CRAFT VOLUNTARY STANDARDS FOR MITIGATION SUPPORT AND REWARDS OUR EFFORTS WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S CLEAR THE LEGISLATURE MUST ACT. UP CALLS UPON THIS BODY TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THE FULL AUTHORITY IN RESOURCES NEEDS TO GATHER DATA AND PREVENT OUR STATE FROM FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF FLORIDA. SIMILAR TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN ARE STATE THE SERIES OF BAD STORM YEARS IN THE FIRST DECADE OF THIS CENTURY. COMBINED WITH AN EXPLOSION THE USE OF PREDICTIVE MODELING AND THE RATE MAKING SPHERE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT COMPETITION AND SHIRTS CONSUMERS. THE COMBINATION DECIMATED THE PRIVATE COMPETITIVE MARKET. AND BECAUSE THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT IN FLORIDA. TO BALLOON INTO HAVING THE LARGEST MARKET SHARE IN THE STATE. HOMEOWNERS THE REAL ESTATE MARKET AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROPERTY TAX REVENUE SUFFERED ACUTE FINANCIAL HARM. LEGISLATION MUST BE ENACTED THAT WELL AT A MINIMUM. GENERATE RELIABLE DATA ON ON RULES THE POLICY COUNTS AND MARKET SHARE OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN AND THE NON ADMITTED SURPLUS LINES MARKET. GIVES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AUTHORITY OVERSIGHT AND SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN INCREASES IN THE MARKET SHARE OF INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE COMPANIES BOTH ADMITTED AND NOT ADMITTED. STATUTORILY MANDATE MITIGATION SUPPORT AND SUPPORT OR FOR SUPPORT AND REWARD PROGRAMS. AND LIMIT THE USE OF PREDICTIVE MODELS AND RATE FILINGS AND MANDATE THAT THEY FACTOR IN LOCAL FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES IN. THE REGION AND MITIGATION MEASURES SUCH AS BRUSH CLEARANCE UNDERTAKEN BY HOMEOWNERS. A COMPLICATING DYNAMIC AND HOW INSURERS ARE REACTING TO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE WAY THEY UNDERWRITE. WHICH IS ASSESSING AND PRICING RISK. HUMAN UNDERWRITERS AND ACTUARIES HAVE BEEN USING HISTORICAL DATA TACK ASSESS RISK PRICE POLICIES AND CHOOSE THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR DECADES. BUT NOW IT IS COMMON FOR INSURERS TO RELY HEAVILY SOMETIMES EXCLUSIVELY ON MODELS THAT PURPORT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE. BASED ON ALGORITHMS INSTEAD OF HUMAN UNDERWRITERS AND HISTORICAL DATA. WIN THE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COMMUNITY HAVE IDENTIFIED THESE MODELS IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF REDUCED AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF CROP INSURANCE IN MANY REGIONS OF THE U. S.. THE MODELS ARE DESIGNED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT SELL THEM TO INSURERS. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE AN ECONOMIST AN MBA TO FIGURE OUT THE COMPANIES THAT CREATE AND SELL THESE MODELS WANT THEM TO APPEAL TO INSURERS. INSURERS THAT ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF BEING PROFITABLE. MODELERS HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO OVERSTAY RISK TO HELP THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY CLIENTS JUSTIFY RATE INCREASES. INTEGRITY PROBLEMS WITH OUTCOME ORIENTED PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS ARE COMPOUNDING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON INSURANCE CONSUMERS. WE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PRIVATE MARKET SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM. AND TO THIS AND WE'VE WORKED KILEY WITH THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE AND ARE WORKING TO CREATE A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. WHO CAN HELP CONSUMERS FIND AFFORDABLE COVERAGE JUST AS WE DID AFTER THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE? BY GIVING MORE TOOLS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN CODIFYING MITIGATION DISCOUNTS AND SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE ARE CRUCIAL PIECE TO SOLVE THIS PUZZLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. INTERESTING. IN MY CORRECT THEN THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT THE REASON FOR A LOT OF THESE CHANGES IS THAT. THEY'RE NOT USING OF PREDICTIVE. MODELING INSTEAD OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL APPROACHES. IS THAT CORRECT YA OUR IMPRESSION IS THAT THAT IS DRIVING A LOT OF A LOT OF THE. CONTRACTION IN THE MARKET. KATE AND IN IS THAT WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RATIONALE FOR DOING IT IN THIS FASHION. WELL I THINK IT USED TO BE THE CASE THAT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SEND SOMEBODY OUT TO INSPECT PROPERTY WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO ENSURE WHEN IT CAME UP FOR RENEWAL THAT. WITH A LARGE INSURANCE MARKET I'M YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE ISN'T SUSTAINABLE PRACTICE AND SO THIS IS A. SORT OF. LARGER. YOU KNOW MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF LOOKING AT LARGE NUMBERS OF HOMES AND LOOKING AT ZIP CODES AND AND OTHERS TO PRICE AND ASSESS THE RISK. AND ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IT'S LESS ACCURATE OR JUST MORE EXPENSIVE TO THE HOMEOWNER. WELL IT IT IT IS LESS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT THE MODELS THEMSELVES ONLY FACTOR IN. THE RISK. AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THE HOMEOWNERS DOING OR WHAT THE COMMUNITY MIGHT BE DOING TO. PREVENT OR MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF FIRES AND SO WHEN THEY'RE USED WITHOUT LOOKING AT MITIGATION OR WHAT WITHOUT LOOKING AT LOCAL FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES ARE OR. OTHER THINGS THAT COMMUNITIES MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT WE THINK THAT DAY I'M. MAYBE OVERSTAY RISK OR AT LEAST REPRESENT RISK WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE REALLY BORN. FOLLOW UP ON THE CHAIRS QUESTION BUT THAT DOESN'T THE MARKETPLACE KIND OF BALANCE THAT OUT SO LET'S JUST SAY YOU'RE RIGHT OKAY AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE RIGHT OR WRONG. BOB BUT LET'S JUST SAY YOU'RE RIGHT. I DOZEN ANOTHER INSURANCE COMPANY SAY. HAY. MY COMPETITOR HERE IS WRITING ADD UP POLICY PREMIUM THAT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN. BASED ON OUR ON THE GROUND LOOK AT THINGS WE CAN WE CAN UNDERCUT THAT WITH REASONABLE RISK THAT WE THINK WE'RE WILLING TO UNDERTAKE. AS A DOZEN THE MARKETPLACE KIND OF BALANCE THAT OUT OVER TIME. WELL THAT THAT MAY HAPPEN IN IN SOME INSTANCES BUT I I THINK THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT THERE'S ENOUGH. ELISE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN GATHERED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE PLACES IN WHICH THERE WON'T BE SOMETHING TO FILL. THAT GAP IF IF ONE. SURE IS EASY THEY'RE CHARGING UP A PREMIUM THIS ON AFFORDABLE OR OR DECIDING TO LEAVE AN AREA. HOME COMPLETELY I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE FLORIDA STORY IS AS IT I THINK TELLING IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE THERE WERE A LOT OF ENSURES THAT LEFT THE MARKET AND. BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE YOU KNOW THEN THEN PEOPLE START PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE. AND DID YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE BEYOND ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE LEAVING THE MARKET. WELL I I THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF DATA THAT WE HAVE SURVEY DATA THAT WE COLLECTED. AS AN ORGANIZATION. VOTE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN IS GATHERING MORE DATA SO THAT WE CAN GET AND ACT MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE OF THE PROBLEM BUT. THE COMPLAINTS THAT WERE RECEIVING AS AN ORGANIZATION AND AND THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT ON IN THE OAKLAND HILLS AND. IN SOME OF THE RURAL COUNTIES I'M DOES SUGGEST THAT THAT THIS IS BECOMING A PROBLEM OKAY BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED AS YOU ARE. AND I THINK IT'S AGAIN THIS BALANCING ACT OF THAT WE WENT OVER REGULATED MARKETPLACE THAT. IS GOING TO SELF CORRECT. WITHOUT GOVERNMENT GET IN THE WAY OR. DO WE NEED TO STEP IN TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND TO CREATE AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A MARKET THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. HERE'S HOW I GUESS OF A WHAT'S INTERESTING WITH THAT IS THE FACT IT IS AT ALL STATE TO OUR STATE FARM ONE OF THE MARKETS WAS GONE FOR A DECADE IS NOW COME BACK. AND KICK IS HER ANY OF IT. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY THIS CONCERN THAT IGNORING THEORY MARKET BASED PA PROGRAMS WORK BECAUSE THE COMPETITION AND THE ABILITY TO. TO SORT OF MOVE INTO OUR AVOID AND TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE THE INSURANCE AND AND TO REAP THE REWARDS. OFFSET SIR COUNTERS THE THE. A OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS SENATE IS A QUESTION IT'S REGULATION TO PROTECT US OF OR. AND I GET IN THE WAY SO WHAT IS IT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS. PARTICULARLY ON THIS SPRING ON THIS SPECIFIC SUBJECT AND FOLLOWING UP THE QUESTION SENT BOTH THE SENATE GLAZER NIGHT IT JUST PASSED. WELL AND I THINK THAT LIKE I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY WE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PRIVATE MARKET SOLUTION WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE INSURANCE MARKET CORRECT ITSELF WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. ENSURES RECOGNIZING MITIGATION STANDARDS AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST ON THE SOMEWHAT UNIFORM BASIS AND THAT WAS A LOT OF THE WORK IN THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE WAS. TRYING TO GET TO THIS IDEA OF IS THEIR UNIFORM SET OF STANDARDS THAT. YOU KNOW MOST OR ALL CARRIERS WOULD AGREE TO THAT WOULD MAKE A HOME INSURABLE FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT. I MEAN. HELLFIRE MENTION THIS IN THEIR TESTIMONY THAT THEY. IN SOME CASES THEY'LL GO OUT TO A PROPERTY AND DEL. DO AN INSPECTION AND IF THE INSPECTION COMES BACK. YOU KNOW COMPLIANT THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL SAY. OH OKAY I THINK WE WE WILL ACTUALLY RENEW THAT POLICY BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE IS THA THAT ISN'T HAPPENING IN SO THERE NEEDS TO BE. SOME GREATER LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY OF WHAT THE HOMEOWNER CAN DO IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR INSURANCE OR KEEP IT AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE. AND SO I THINK WE TRIED TO GET THERE AND I THINK THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET THERE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND. ALL. OLIVEIRENSE INDICATES THAT YOU KNOW THE FAIR PLAN POLICIES ARE GROWING A LITTLE BIT AND SURPLUS LINES ARE GROWING A LITTLE BIT. AND THE NON ADMITTED MARKET'S SHRINKING A LITTLE BIT AND I THINK BEFORE IT GETS TO BE. YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT AND THAT WE WANNA. TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. MY LAST QUESTION THAT YOU TALKED. EARLIER ABOUT THE DESIRE TO HAVE MORE DATA. ARE YOU FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO GET THAT DATA ARE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IT. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK SHOULD I SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT THAT LEGISLATION WOULD OFFER OR. IS IT JUST THAT THE THE DATA HASN'T BEEN COLLECTED I MEAN IS IS THERE A DATA ISSUE. YEAH I THINK THERE'S THERE'S TWO SIDES OF IT ARE THE OMMISSIONER MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF. DATA PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGHER RISK CLASSIFICATIONS THAT NO ONE INSURER SEEMS TO HAVE ENOUGH LAS EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE RISKS REALLY IS AND SO. THEY'RE SORT OF PIECING THAT TOGETHER AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE ALL OF A REAL SENSE OF OF THAT PICTURE AYE THERE AND THEY WOULDN'T THEY HAVE ASKED TO HAVE MORE OF THAT DATA. THE SECOND PART OF IT IS. I THINK ON A GRANULAR LEVEL WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR YOU KNOW BY COUNTY OR BY ZIP CODE OR HIGH RISK AREA HOW WE DEFINE HOWEVER WE DEFINE THAT. THE INCREASE IN THE FARE PLAN POLICY COUNT THE INCREASE IN THE NON ADMITTED MARKET AND THAT DECREASES IN THE ADMITTED MARKET. AND THAT DATA IS YOU KNOW IT IS COLLECTED IN SOMETIMES BUT I THINK IT IS DIFFICULT AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT. DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE RESOURCES OR. AND THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE APPETITE TO PROVIDE. THOSE ARE DIFFERENT ISSUES OF COURSE THE SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE THAT APPETITE SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO FORCE IT AND SOMETIMES. YOU SHOULD MAKE PEOPLE LEAVE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO. SO. A. I THINK THAT DOES IT IN TERMS OF. MY QUESTIONS ON YOUR AND. TESTIMONY DID HAVE ONE QUESTION I BELIEVE FOR. MS A. I HINTON. THE A. THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT THAT YOU REPRESENT. HAS THERE BEEN ANY EFFORT TO TRY TO PULL LOCAL RESOURCES TO CREATE THEIR OWN KIND OF SELF. INSURANCE PROGRAM IS SET SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN CONSIDERED. BITS OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION. I DON'T THINK WE'VE QUITE GOTTEN THAT FAR YET BUT YEAH I KNOW THE IDEA IS OUT THERE AND AT SOME I MEAN WE. I THINK WE WOULD EXPORT ANYTHING HERE IF IT IF IT HELPED OUR FOLKS OUT SO THAT'S THAT IS AN IDEA THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE. WE JUST HAVEN'T QUITE GOTTEN THAT FAR YET. I DO ONLY COUNTIES WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT WERE CUT JUSTIN INTERESTING POSSIBILITY AND AND LASTLY FOR. ACHIEVER CARMEN THE YEAH. IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTL WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS. THE BIG PROBLEM WITH THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS THAT THERE'S RED TAPE THE DELAYS THE ABILITY OF AGENCIES TO WORK TOGETHER AND WE DID HEAR THE IN SOME INSTANCES. SOME OF THE DIFFERENT. GROUPS OF THE HECK WITH THERE WERE JUST GOING TO CALL YOU UP AND WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PAPERWORK LATER. I DIDN'T IT MY NURSING IS THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THE BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS. ANOTHER IS THE THE FACT THAT IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET OTHER AGENCIES RESPONDING AND THAT WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE. WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE ONCE WE GET A LOOK AT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WHAT FOURTEEN RED FLAG DAYS IN A ROW KNOWING THAT THIS COULD VERY LIKELY CAUSE FIRES AND. THE THOMAS FIRE WHIC IS ONE OF I THINK FIVE THAT TOOK PLACE ALL AT THE SAME TIME. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHISUM'S COMMISSAR NEVER WENT OUT PRESS OF THEM THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT OUT. WITH IT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD. LIKE TO SEE. YES BY THE THE FUNDING YOU THINK WOULD BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ALL OF THAT ABILITY. TO PRIYA OF PRE STAGED PRE POSITION. IN CASES WHERE YOU'RE HAVING THAT KIND OF EXTREME WEATHER THAT'S HIGHLY LIKELY TO CREATE A FIRE PROBLEMS. I YEAH I DO I THINK COME AGAIN AT THAT THE SYSTEM IS SIXTY YEARS OLD AND CERTAINLY THE FIRES JUST IN MY CAREER OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS THE FIRES HAVE CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY. IN THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY'RE DEVOURING YOU KNOW PROPERTY AND LAND. SO FOR US TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WERE OPERATING NOW WITH FEWER FIRE RESOURCES THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'RE MAKING MORE REQUESTS FOR RESOURCES TO THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THAN EVER BEFORE AND WE'RE SEEING MORE UNFILLED RESOURCE ORDERS THAN EVER BEFORE SO TO BE ABLE TO PUT THESE RESOURCES ON THE ROAD. I THINK CHIEF PIMLOTT THAT THE DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE MENTIONED EARLIER. OUR GOAL IS TO ALWAYS TRYING KEEP THESE INCIDENTS AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE AND WE CAN ONLY DO THAT WITH RESOURCES. BUT EVEN IF THE RESOURCES. AREN'T ABLE TO KEEP THEM SMALL WE CAN RE DIRECT THESE AND AS YOU MENTIONED THAT SHE FOR INSTANCE. I EH. FORESIGHT TO MOVE THE RESOURCES INTO MANSIO AHEAD OF THE MUD SLIDES AB THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WE CAN SAVE AND HOW MUCH SHE EVEN IF WE CAN SAVE THE PROPERTY THAT THE LIVES THAT WE SAVED BY THE PRE POSITIONING THOSE RESOURCES SO. WHAT? WE ARE COALITION I'VE NEVER SEEN THE FIRE AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA COME TOGETHER LIKE WE HAVE NOW LOCAL STATE. WE HAVE. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS COMING TOGETHER TO SAY THIS PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES ADDING DISPATCHERS TO THE DISPATCH CENTER IS THE HEAD OF CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENTS. WILL MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IN IN YEARS. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS. CENTER MORE. THE TO ABSORB VILLAGE GO LET LET'S DO THIS IN THE PROPER PROTOCOL SENATOR GLAZER FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORE. ALRIGHT I THANK YOU AND I I KNOW WE'RE RUNNING SHORT OF TIME SO I WANT TO BE. A BRIEF BUT JUST SAID CHIEF A CARMEN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND INSIGHT THAT WE'VE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WE APPRECIATE ALL YOUR GOOD WORK AND. THE WORK OF ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND. BY MISTER WAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT AS WELL I HAD A QUESTION FOR MS HEATON. HI YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE UP HERE AND THIS THAT AND THEN IS SEAT TO MANDATE THINGS. WHETHER IT'S ABOUT FIRE COVERAGE RATES. BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT. WHERE THERE ARE COUNTIES AND IN THIS CASE ARE RULE COUNTIES ARE MAKING GOOD CHOICES IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT? AND WHETHER CITING DEVELOPMENT. AND. YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO MANDATE THOSE CHOICES ON YOUR FOLKS SURE THEY WOULDN'T LIKE THAT EITHER. BUT I YOU KNOW ARE THEY GONNA REBUILD IN THESE HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS ARE THEY GONNA PROVE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN THESE HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS. YOU KNOW. THAT'S A DELICATE PLACE FOR US TO BE AND I'M SURE IT IS FOR YOU BUT ANY RESPONSE TO THAT CONCERN. YEAH IT IS IT IS A DELICATE TASTE FOR ME TO BE BUT. WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT A NUMBER OF OUR COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY NO GROWTH COUNTIES RIGHT NOW? AND. A NUMBER OF OUR COUNTIES THAT I'VE HEARD FROM THAT WERE. AT IMPACTED BY THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES REALIZE THE NEED TO REBUILD SMART AND TO WHEN THEY DO REBUILD. TICKLED IT A LOT OF CONSIDERATION AS TO WHERE HOW.% FIRE RISK. THEY'VE NOT HAD TO DEAL WITH US BEFORE STOW THE LEARNING PROCESS FOR THEM. BUT THEY ARE TAKING ALL OF THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION SO. THEY THERE IS A RECOGNITION THERE THAT THEY PERHAPS NEED TO CHANGE BUT FROM WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND THEY WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE. IN ANY OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE GREAT AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT AND. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO MONITOR TO. THAT I'M GONNA BE ETCHED IN SEEN THAT THE CHOICES THEY MAKE ANOTHER IS A LOT OF PRESSURE. LOCALLY TO THE THE BUILD AND REBUILD AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THAT'S A PLACE WHERE I THINK THE OVERSIGHT FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S. A SOMETHING THAT I THINK MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE AND I HOPE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THEIR CHOICES BUT I HOPE THEY MAKE GOOD ONES THANK YOU. MORE LIKE. THE NOT JUST HEARD HOW MANY OF YOUR RESIDENTS IN YOUR COUNTIES PAY ALL CASH FOR THEIR HOMES. YOU KNOW THAT STATE I DON'T HAVE. SO USUALLY WITH YOU DON'T. YOU GET A RENEWAL NOTICE THAT SAYS WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU. YOUR INSURANCE. THEN. THE HOMEOWNERS FORCED TO LOOK AROUND. FOR THE NEXT LETTER IS GONNA BE FROM MORTGAGE COMPANY. SAYING HEY YOU BETTER GET INSURANCE OR OR ELSE SIR AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IS. SO ONE METHOD WOULD BE JUST TO PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE RIGHT THE MENU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE INSURANCE. HE CAN INJURE RICH ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE LOSS. THE SECOND IS YOU GOTTA SCRAMBLE ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS MISTER WADE WHAT IS THE. INVOLVEMENT IN. HOMEOWNERS NSURANCE FIRE INSURANCE. WITH THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY HOW THEY INTERFACING WITH THE INSURANCE AGENTS THE INDUSTRY. MA'AM RIGHT THANK YOU SO THE AND. MOST I MEAN GETTING EVERY. MORTGAGE COMPANY WOULD REQUIRE. HAD INSURANCE ON. BASIC HAZARD INSURANCE ON THE PROPERTY. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING REQUIRE A FULLY COMPREHENSIVE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. PRODUCT AS WE KNOW IT. THEY DON'T. NEED THE CONTENTS AND SHARED THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES AND OTHER THINGS WHAT THEY WANT. BASIC HAZARD INSURANCE THAT PROTECTS THEIR COLLATERAL SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IF. AND AND AT A POLICY HOLDERS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE INSURANCE. NINO TO THEM IT FROM THE PRIVATE MARKET OR. THEY LET IT LAPSE TIME. AT THE MORTGAGE COMPANY WILL FORCE PLACER LENDER PLACE AN INSURANCE PRODUCT ONTO THE THE COLLATERAL BUT IT WILL BE A VERY A AT BASIC POLICY THAT WILL. COVER YOU KNOW FROM. THE pTHINGS TOMMEN WON'T COVER PERSONAL PROPERTY OR ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES ARE THE THINGS LIKE THAT. I'M JUST NEW TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF THEIR COLLATERAL AND TYPICALLY THOSE ARE PROVIDED BY NON ADMITTED. INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND THEY COST MORE. OKAY THANK YOU AND CHIEF JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION. CAL FIRE MENTION THAT THEY GET CAP AND TRADE FUNDING. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WE SAW A LOT OF. FIRES WERE STARTED BY ELECTRICAL LINES. A POWER LINES AT THE BUTTE FIRE BUT. THE NOME I MET CINNAMON NAPA AND SANTA ROSA. ARE YOU ARE USING ANY CAP AND TRADE FUNDING TO TRY TO HARDEN SOME OF THESE ELECTRIC LINES. A NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE WE E WERE. ABLE TO GET SOME CAP AND TRADE FUNDING TO INITIALLY DEPLOY FOR THIS FIRE SEASON THE PRE POSITIONING THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT'S A ONE TIME FUNDING NOTHING ON GOING IN THAT I I BELIEVE LATER THIS WEEK WILL LAST FOR. A SOME ADDITIONAL CAP AND TRADE FUNDING TO BUY ADDITIONAL APPARATUS TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES BUT NOTHING FOR HARDENING ELECTRICAL THAT I'M AWARE OF. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF TWO AND A HALF DAYS OF WILDFIRES. CREATES AS MUCH GREENHOUSE GAS AS ALL THE CARS IN THE STATE. RUNNING FOR ENTIRE YEAR SO WE'RE WE'RE LOSING ALL THE BENEFIT EVERYTHING THAT. SACRAMENTO TRYING TO DO IT THE STATE BY ELECTRIFYING EVERYTHING SO. WILL IT WILL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE HELP YOU BY PREVENTING FIRES. IF THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY AREA. AND ANNA AND I SAW IT IN IN SENATE ROSES TRAGIC WITH THAT THESE TRANSFORMERS BLOWING UP. WE WERE WE WOULD AGREE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE WITH THE ELECTRICAL UTILITY COMPANY ALLOWING THEM TO SHUT OFF POWER DURING THESE CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU MADAM BACKBENCHER. THINKING YES I WISH THAT WERE AN EASY DISCUSSION IN THE THOMAS FAR THEY SHUT OFF THE ELECTRICITY SO THAT THE PUMPS COULDN'T PUMP SO THAT THEY COULD GET WATER TO THE HOUSES OF THE HOUSES BURNED DOWN LEAST THOSE ARE. SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND GARAGE DOORS SHUT SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE I THINK WE'VE NOW HAD FIVE THIS IS HER FIFTH HEARING FOR THE. COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WERE. WE'VE HOPEFULLY IDENTIFIED MOST OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING HOW WE RESOLVE THEM COURSES. IS. GOING TO BR ANOTHER CHALLENGE BUT WITH THAT THANK YOU FOLKS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BE HERE. GUY I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT APPRECIATE YOUR HIGHLIGHTING THESE ISSUES FOR US THANK YOU SO MUCH. OUR FINAL PANEL BE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IS SO ARE HOMEOWNERS INSURERS REEXAMINING THE CALIFORNIA MARKET THIS IS SORT OF THE. THE THE FINAL QUESTION THAT WE. WANTED TO ADDRESS HERE TODAY SO COULD WE HAVE. CARA CROSS GENERAL COUNSEL. OF FOR THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA BILL. CLARK ARE CLINICALLY. WITH SUTTER INSURANCE NORWOOD REPRESENTING THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS TO CALIFORNIA ROB DAYR. Y. PRONOUNCE IT RIGHT. AT GEORGE PETERSON INSURANCE AGENCY OF SANTA ROSA YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN PRETTY BUSY RECENTLY. AND TIMBER NET CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENT AND MANAGING DIRECTOR BURN XIN WILCOX REPRESENTING THE SURPLUS LINE ASSOCIATION. OF CALIFORNIA. FOLKS THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. STARTING. FROM THE SIDE JUST IN AND CONSPICUOUSLY. GREAT. ALRIGHTY SO. WOULD LIKE TO TRY FIVE MINUTES APIECE AND WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE LITTLE TIME FOR QUESTIONS SO. IF YOU COULD TRY TO KEEP TO THAT. TIME FRAME IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF WILL START IF WE COULD LET'S START WITH CARA CROSS THANK YOU SENATOR AYE. AYE PREPARE TEN MINUTES BERMAN GONNA TALK REAL FAST AND CUT OUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY SAID WHY DON'T WE MEET YOU HALFWAY HOW ABOUT SEVEN THE TAKE IT. SO CARE ACROSS WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA AND TOGETHER ARE ON SIX MEMBER COMPANIES WRITE THEM MAJORITY OF THEM MARKET HOMEOWNERS MARKETPLACE IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE GUY WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL HERE WHICH IS AVAILABILITY OBVIOUSLY INSURERS WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE INSURANCE AVAILABLE AND CONSUMERS DEFINITELY NEED INSURANCE. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY BECAUSE ALLOWS EVERYBODY TO LEARN WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS OF NECESSARY TO. THAT WILL KEEP. THAT'S PROTECT US THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE. IT'S ALL START BY EMPHASIZING THAT WITH RESPECTIVE EL ABILITY HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKETPLACE IN CALIFORNIA IS WORKING. HOMEOWNERS ARE FINDING INSURANCE TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES IN THE EVENT OF WILDFIRE AND INSURERS HAVE BEEN RESPONDING IN MASS TO HELP HOMEOWNERS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE RECENT WILDFIRES. REBUILD THEIR LIVES. SINCE DAY ONE INSURANCE THE BEEN THERE. PATH HEATHER CATASTROPHE TEAMS ON THE ROUND TO HELP WITH RECOVERY PROCESS IT SHOULD IMMEDIATE PAYMENTS FOR HOUSING LIVING EXPENSES. AND QUICKLY RESPONDING TO CLAIMS. AS FOR AVAILABILITY MOVING FORWARD ALLOWING THE MARKET TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION WITHOUT DISRUPTED MANDATES WILL PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS THE ABILITY ABILITY TO CONTINUE FIGHTING. HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE EVEN IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS. BUT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN THE CAL FIRE NUMBERS WE BELIEVE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE HOMEOWNERS ARE FINDING INSURANCE IN THE MIDMARKET. I WILL. COMMENT BRIEFLY ON THE DECEMBER WHITE PAPER THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ISSUED THAT COMMISSIONER JONES REFERENCED. DEPARTMENT REPORTED. FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT THERE WERE THE PUMP OF. US IN COMPLAINTS ABOUT RENEWAL SAN NON RENEWALS FROM FORTY ONE COMPLAINTS IN TWENTY TEN TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE COMPLAINTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. HUNDRED FORTY THREE COMPLAINTS WE DO NOT BELIEVE OUT OF FOUR POINT SIX MILLION OR MORE RESIDENTIAL POLICIES IN THESE HIGH RISK AREAS INDICATES AN AVAILABILITY PROBLEM. IF ANYTHING IT DEMONSTRATES A MARKETPLACE IS WORKING. OTHER NUMBERS ON NEW RENEWED AND I'M REALLY POLICIES REFUTE ANY ASSERTION THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. OF THE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND POLICIES IN SELECTED COUNTIES WITH THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE HIGH RISK BUYERS. JUST ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THESE POLICIES WERE NON RENEWED BY THE INSURER. WHILE THE OTHER FIBERS THAT WERE ACTUALLY NINE WE NEED BY THE POLICY HOLDER. THE LOW USE OF THE CALIFORNIA PET PUT THEIR PLAN WHICH IS A SAFETY NET AS YOU'VE HEARD ALSO DEMONSTRATES A HEALTHY PERKY MARKETPLACE HIM I WILL NOT DETAIL WHAT THE FAIR PLAN DOES THIS. HURT. INDEED SOME HOMEOWNERS MAY PERCEIVE AN INDELIBLE A PROP PROBLEM IF THERE LONGTIME INSURER. WILL NOT RENEW THEM THEY CANNOT FIND COVERAGE ON THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT HOW OR IF THEY CANNOT FIND COVERAGE WITH THE BIG NAME INSURER. HOMEOWNERS ARE FINDING INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE MIDMARKET. SOMETIMES IT WILL REQUIRE SHOPPING AROUND TO GETTING THIS DISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT AGENT OR BROKER AS YOU'LL HEAR LATER ON. OR SEVEN JURORS CHOOSING NOT TO RENEW IN CERTAIN AREAS YES BUT AT THE SAME TIME OTHER INSURERS ARE WRITING THEIR RISK. THERE ARE MANY IMPORTANT REASONS WHY SOME INSURERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RENEW ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS. IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT THE BUSINESS IMPACT ONE MY LARGE CARRIERS TELLS ME THAT IT TAKES FOUR TIMES AS LONG AND FOUR TIMES THE COST TO GET A NEW. CUSTOMER AS IT DOES TO KEEP A CURRENT ONE. BUT INSURERS NEED TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGE AND SPREAD THEIR RISKS SO THEY CAN BE THERE FOR ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. A BIG ISSUE WITH RESPECTIVE L. ABILITY IS OVER EXPOSURE. IF INSURANCE OVER EXPOSED IN A PARTICULAR HIGH RISK AREA THAT THEY NEED TO LOWER THE CONCENTRATION PREVENT FINANCIAL IMPAIRMENT FROM ONE MAJOR FIRE. IT'S PRO FINANCIAL SOLVENCY RISK MANAGEMENT ENSURES THAT INSURERS CAN KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. ACROSS THE STATE HER DEPENDING ON THEM. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WERE ONE INSURER MAY NEED TO PREVENT OVER CONCENTRATION IN THE AREA. THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT INSURANCE WITH LESS CONCENTRATION RISK HAVE STEPPED INTO THE MARKET TO ADDRESS CONSUMER NEEDS. IN A COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE THIS WILL CONTINUE. SOME INSURERS ALSO NEED TO RENEW CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DOES NOT PERMIT PERMIT AN ADEQUATE RATE. BECAUSE INSURERS ARE PRICE CONTROLLED BY THE STATE THEY MUST REACT TO RATE SUPPRESSION BY REDUCING THEIR EXPOSURE TO RISKY AREAS OR BE FORCED HAVE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE SUBSIDIZED RISKY AREAS. THAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR AFFORDABILITY. JUSTIFIABLY HOMEOWNERS IT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE DOES COSTS BORNE RISKIER AREAS OF THE STATE. WE WOULD EXPECT THIS BECAUSE THE PRICE MUST RELIEF REFLECT THE RISK IN ORDER TO PAY CLAIMS. TO DO OTHERWISE WOULD AND FAIRLY RESULT HOMEOWNERS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE SUBSIDIZING THOSE CHOOSING TO LIVE IN RISKIER AREAS. HONG CHURNS RATES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND MUST BE ACCURATELY SOUND CANNOT BE INADEQUATE EXCESSIVE OR UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY. THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE'S WHITE PAPER QUESTIONS AFFORDABILITY OF HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF MISS PRE APPROVAL HOMEOWNER INSURANCE RATES INCLUDING THE FAIR PLAN IN THE CALIFORNIA BEFORE INSURERS CAN USE THEM. SOME OF SUGGESTED UP TO I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS THAT MITIGATION EFFORTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO ADJUST RATES. IT IS DIFFICULT WERE RATES ARE ALREADY INADEQUATE. REGARDLESS IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT MEDICATION IS JUST ONE PART OF THE EQUATION. MANY FACTORS GO INTO THE UNDERWRITING OF RISK IN ADDITION TO MEDICATION INCLUDING VEGETATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE PREDOMINANT CONCERN. ROAD ACCESS AND SLOW. SOME OF THESE FACTORS CANNOT BE CONTROLLED EVEN WITH MEDICATION. FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE RECENT WILDFIRES HELLFIRE COULD NOT DRIVE DOWN CERTAIN CLOTHES SOCKS BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T WIDE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO TURN THEIR ENGINES AROUND. STILL INJURIES GENERALLY SUPPORT HOME SPECIFIC AND COMMUNICATE COMMUNITY MITIGATION EFFORTS. INSURERS AT BUNDY COMMUNITY EFFORTS FOR MANY YEARS THROUGH GRANTS TO FIRE CITY COUNCILS EMPIRE WHITES COMMUNITIES. THEY ALSO SUPPORT MORE STRINGENT BUILDING SANDERS WITH FIRE RESISTANT MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES. HOWEVER THERE ARE LIMITS TO THE ABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT HOMES WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE MAJOR UNCONTROLLED FIRE. WITH ALL THAT IN SANTA ROSA I ALSO WAS RECENTLY AT A TRIMMERS HOLLY TASK FORCE. MEETING WHERE CAL FIRE PRESENTED AND. SHOWED DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE CULT OF THE SENATE AS AN ART BAY FIRES. ON THE SHOULD ONE EXAMPLE OF A FIRE WISE COMMUNITY THAT SURVIVED AND ONE THAT DID NOT AND SO WHEN I ASKED. KELP WIRED. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT LITIGATION IS AT WORK IN THE SAID PAUL SOMETIMES IT DOES AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T? SO WE WOULD YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WANT TO SUPPORT PEOPLE MITIGATING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HELP BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS ESPECIALLY THOSE INADEQUATE RATES. FIRST SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT WORK AS WELL. BEFORE I CONCLUDE I FEEL COMPELLED I DO FEEL COMPELLED THE COMMENT GENERALLY ON THE FACT THAT SEVENTY PIECE OF THE LEGISLATION HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT MAY NOT EXIST. EVER HAVE A COMIC THAT I WILL COME AT THE MANY THESE COMMENTS CONCEPTS PLACE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGING BALANCE THEIR BUSINESS. AND COULD CAUSE A TRUE AVAILABILITY CRISIS AND WE DON'T WANT. IN AFTERMATH OF NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. WE WE SAW WHAT COULD HAPPEN STATE LAW MANDATED INSURANCE TO OFFER EARTHQUAKE COVERAGE EVERYTIME THEY SOLD HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY. FOLLOWING THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE BEGAN RESTRICTING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE SALES IN THE STATE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT RESPONSIBLY CONTINUE TO WRITE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE POLICIES. AS THE PROBLEM MORE ON THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH S. GROWS AND CALIFORNIA CONDOM USE AFFECTED. THE STATE RESPONDED BY CREATING THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. THE DIFFERENT THAN THE CALIBER AND DIFFERENT THAN CALIFORNIA CREATED FAIR PLAN. BOTH SERVE THE SAME PURPOSE OF ENSURING AN OPTION THAT IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR PHONE MANNERS. HOWEVER UNLIKE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE HERE THERE IS A THRIVING PRIVATE MARKET FOR FIRE INSURANCE THAT WE NEED TO PRESERVE. RATHER THAN JEOPARDIZE WITH LEGISLATION THAT COULD RESULT IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. IN CONCLUSION CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE MARKET IS HEALTHY AND VIABLE. INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN THIS NEW NORMAL OF LONGER FIRE SEASONS AND MORE FIRED DUE TO DROUGHT AND OUTDATED FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. COMMITTEES MAY NEED TO SHOP AROUND MORE BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE. AS LONG AS INSURERS ARE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR RISK APPROPRIATELY AND HAVE ADEQUATE RATES TO PAY CLAIMS INSURERS WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE IN THE STATE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO COME TO SOLUTIONS TO INSURING THAT JUST INSURANCE MARKET WORKS AND CONTINUING TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO PROPERLY MANAGE OUR FORESTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BILL CARNEGIE. DID I PRONOUNCE RIGHTS ARE YOU DEAD THANK YOU. COME MY NAME IS BILL KLEIN QUE I'M. THE OWNER AND PRESIDENT OF A SMALL DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY CALLED SATTAR. WERE DOMICILED IN PETALUMA CALIFORNIA AND I LIVE IN OF AUTO. SOUTHERN CHARM'S COMPANY RIGHTS BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PREMIUM DEPENDING ON. THE MARKETPLACE OF THAT ABOUT A MILLION YEARS CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS. ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WE DO RIGHT IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS ASKED TO JOIN A. NEWLY STARTED LOBBYING GROUP CALLED PADDICK. PATTED HIS MEDICAL OF ONLY DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES COMMITTED TO RETELL PRODUCERS ARE COMMITTED TO THE CALIFORNIA. INFRASTRUCTURE. ALL OF OUR THIRTEEN MEMBERS ARE PRETTY PROACTIVE AND WE WE TRY TO GET THE WORD OUT OF WHAT'S BEST FOR US AND WE START THAT ORGANIZATION BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK OUR VOICE WAS HEARD SORTS OF OUR PLEASURE. VERY MUCH A PLEASURE MINE TO BE HERE TODAY TO BE ABLE TO GET MY VOICE HEARD IN THIS TOPIC. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AVAILABILITY INSURANCE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS OVERLAPPING I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE TALK ABOUT YET IS BUYING INSURANCE IS A STRATEGY. WHEN OUR FUTURE PART ME LET'S GO BACK AND KIND OF LOOK AT THE TOPS FIRE THAT STUFF TWENTY MILES FROM OUR OFFICES. WE DIDN'T LOSE A SINGLE HOME IN THE TOPS FIRE WE HAD. EMPLOYEES LOSE THEIR HOMES MY DAD LOST HIS HOME IN A CONVALESCENT MEMBER CARE UNIT. IT WAS A PRETTY SCARY COUPLE DAYS. PART WITHOUT SAID DOWN LET'S START BY CALISTOGA ROAD IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE MY FATHER IN LAW LIVES UP THERE HIS HOUSE IS A DISASTER IT IS A WOOD SHAKE A STRUCK A FRAME STRUCTURE HOUSE WOULD TACK AROUND IT. FUEL LOADS LITERALLY TOUCHING THE HOUSE HE'S GOT COMBUSTIBLE FLUIDS FUELS DIESEL FUELS. HE'S GOT MANZANITA AT THIS THIS IS A A RISK THAT. NO ONE WOULD WANT TO TOUCH HIS ON STEEP GRADE HE'S GOTTA KNOW ACCESS ON THE STREET AT ALL. AND. HIS STRATEGY TO MINOR CHARGES CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT US MOVE DOWN THROUGH. THE VALLEY BACK UP TO FOUND GROW WE RENTED A MILLION DOLLAR HOMES MAYBE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR HOMES AND UNDERWRITERS DREAM COME TRUE THEIR STUCCO CITING TILE HOUSES. CEMENT RETAINING WALLS NON COMBUSTIBLE PLANTS THERE'S HUNDREDS TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED FEET BETWEEN THESE THESE VERY LARGE HOMES. THEN FOR WHICH WE GO DOWN ACROSS WANNA WANNA GET TO WITH THE TOPS ARE WITH THE TYPES FIRE HITS COFFEE PARK. THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD HARDWORKING PEOPLE IT'S KIND OF A STARTER COMMUNITY MAYBE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE NEW HOME BUYERS. COULD BE HARD WORKING PEOPLE LIVE. LIVED AND STILL LIVING COFFEE PARKING AND RETIREES ARE DOWNSIZING. THE STRATEGY THERE IS REALLY KIND OF WHAT EVERYONE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT'S PRICE THAT ONE AFFORDABLE INSURANCE. COFFEE PARK IS. AN ABSOLUTE WONDERFUL PLACE TO LIVE AS WE MOVE TO FOUND GROW THE STRATEGY THERE IS NOT PRICE IT'S COVERAGE THAT MIGHT WANT ADMITTED MARKETS THEY MIGHT WANNA CALIFORNIA TOM SOUTH COMPANY. BUT THEY HAVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES AND IN BED IN THE HOMEOWNERS THEY HAVE FINE ARTS JEWELRY PAINTINGS IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT POLICY THAN A STANDARD HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. THE IDEA RIGHT NOW THAT ONE SIZE FITS ALL SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR IT IS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT ACCEPTABLE WITHIN THE RANK OF WHAT WE ENSURE. TO WHAT THE SUPER STOCK COMPANIES TO ENSURE THAT WE GET BACK TO MY FATHER IN LAW AND HIS POOR STRATEGY MATT DISASTER OF A STRUCTURE IS. HELD HELD HELD TAKE ANYTHING ANY SLOPPY COMPANIES WANT TO GET THEM BECAUSE HE JUST NEEDS COVERAGE AND HE'S GONNA PAY FOR. FOR HIS ISOLATIONISM. SO. WITH THAT SAID I THINK THAT. THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY HEALTH OF FIRE INSURANCE IS IS VERY PREVALENT MY COMPANY OUT OF ALL TAKE EVERY SINGLE HOUSE IN COFFEE PARK. AS THEY REBUILD TAKE EVERYONE OF THEM UP IN FOUNTAIN GROVE ALRIGHT ONE AND THREE I STILL NEED SPREAD ARREST. IN A MATTER WILL MY FATHER LA DOESN'T MIND SHARING HIS PROPERTY. SO. HIS THAT IS VERY COMFORTING HA HA HA HA. SO I'M HIDING IN THERE THERE'S A TON OF MONEY POURING INTO ON THE INSURANCE ARENA I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HEALTHY IS WE HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY WE ARE REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS AND PASSED. AS WELL AS ON OUR OWN RE INSURANCE PURCHASING WHICH GIVES US FURTHER SPREAD OF RISK. I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE THERE IS. NOT ENOUGH COMPETITION FOR DYNAMIC PLACE NOT JUST SOME FUN WITH NUMBERS THERE'S PROBABLY THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND INSURANCE COMPANIES REGULATOR NOT REGULATED BUT REVIEWED BY AND PASSED. ON THERE'S ONLY TWELVE HUNDRED FORTY TO THOSE THAT ARE LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD INCLUDE LIFE AND HEALTH. OF THOSE ONLY A HUNDRED AND SEVEN COMPANIES HAMAR ACTUALLY LICENSE STRIPED HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. OF OUR. DOMESTIC COMPANIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF PATRICK. THERE'S PROBABLY ONLY ABOUT SO TWELVE THEIR WRITING THAT ARE DOMICILED HERE SO I WOULD CAN REVERSE THE WHOLE BOMB. YOU KNOW DISCUSSION YOU GOTTA LOOK AT LOOK AT IT UPSIDE DOWN LET'S INVITE MORE CARRIERS AND. TO DO THAT. IT KIND OF A FUNNY TOPIC THESE EAST COAST COMPANIES SOUTHEAST COMPANIES MIDWEST COMPANIES ALL THE MUTUALS. THEY'RE MORE AFRAID OF THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT THAN THEY ARE THE WILD FIRES SO IF YOU WANT A DYNAMIC PLACE YOU SHOULD WELCOME THESE COMPANIES AND. ALLOW THEM KIND OF THE FREEDOM TO MOVE. ALLOW THEM ONE COMPANY TO CREATE A STRATEGY FOR THE WEALTHY ANOTHER FOR AFFORDABILITY AND I THINK YOU HAVE A REALLY DYNAMIC WORKPLACE AND I. SITTING HERE NEXT TO. OF A FRIEND AND FELLOW PROFESSIONAL THERE'S AN ARMY OF. AT INDEPENDENT BROKERS. THEY'RE HELPING INSUREDS EVERYDAY LIKE THAT NUMBERS ARE FORTY SOMEWHAT THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL BROKER LICENSES OUT THERE THERE'S A LOT TO HELP NATURAL RESOURCES RIGHT NOW. THAT WOULD HELP A BROKER GET BUSINESS TO ACCOMPANY. AND WE FIGHT REALLY HARD FOR BUSINESS AND I'M ONLY ABLE TO WRITE ABOUT A MILLION OF IT SO WELL AND IT IS A VERY DYNAMIC ABOUT MARKETPLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND. I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR FATHER IN LAW AT SOME POINT TO. ON HIS. RISK ISSUES. JOHN NORTHWARD HER REPRESENTING THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA TO ONCE WANT TO SEE OUT OF STATE COMPANIES COMING IN AND COMPETING FOR THE MARKET. GOOD AFTERNOON JURORS AND MEMBER. IN THIS CASE I HATE YOU KNOW SIGN REPRESENTING INDEPENDENT TURNS AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THE SURPLUS LINES ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE WITNESSES HERE FROM BOTH OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO PROVIDE YOU SOME FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET. SPECIALLY IN THESE OF FIRE AREAS. AS YOU HEARD THERE'S A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE STATE. AS IN MOST STATES THERE'S SIX OR EIGHT THAT ARE THE BIG NAME COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF MARKET SHARE YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE COULD YOU SEE HIM ON. TV AND ALL SPORTING EVENTS EVERY NIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME THAT. FOR THE MOST PART THOSE ARE NOT THE COMPANIES THAT. HARM MEMBERS ARE PRESENT SURE WE HAVE LIBERTY MUTUAL AND NATIONWIDE AND MERCURY AND JOB AND. HARTFORD SOME OF THOSE THAT YOU WILL RECOGNIZE BUT BY AND LARGE IT'S THOSE OTHER NINETY INSURANCE CARRIES YOU PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF. BUT THEY SERVE ANY REALLY CRITICAL ROLE IN CALIFORNIA. IF FOR REPEAL OF AS INDICATED WE HAVE AGENTS AND BROKERS IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HARM. THEY DON'T ADVERTISE A LOT THEY DON'T ADVERTISE A LOT NATIONALLY THERE BUT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEY ARE THE MARKET BEYOND THE. YOU KNOW SIX OR EIGHT REALLY BIG COMPANIES SOMETIMES WHAT YOU SEE IS PEOPLE GETTING NON RENEWED BY BIGGER MARKET SHARE PEOPLE THEN PANICKING BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE. CINCINNATI INSURANCE COMPANY OR THE OHIO CASUALTY OR THE CI G. OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT THAT'S ALL ROLL OUR MEMBERS PLAY AND IS AN INSURANCE BROKER YOUR LICENSE TO BE HELLA. ACCESS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THAT ENTIRE MARKET IF YOU'RE NOT APPOINTED BY A COMPANY AS A BROKER YOU CAN GO WITH. ALBEIT STILL APPLY TO THAT COMPANY URGED US SENATE APPLICATION TONIGHT COMPANY IF YOU CANNOT DO IT THROUGH THOSE SOURCES YOU CAN GO TO. AN INSURANCE WHOLESALER AND WHOLESALER WHAT MIGHT HAVE MARKETS TO OTHER PARTS THAT OTHER GUY. INSURERS THAT THAT AGENCY DOESN'T OR. TO GO THROUGH THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET AND THEIR MEMBERS. REQUIRED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE SURPLUS LINES ASSOCIATION. JUST A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR WITNESSES AND THAT IS FROM AGENT BROKER STANDPOINT WE WANT A VERY VIABLE MARKET. WE WANT AS MANY INSURERS HERE HAS IT AS WE CAN BUT IT WOULD TERMS IS REALLY NOT A. HELP FIX SCIENCE AND IT'S IT'S NOT UNUSUAL YOU LOOK IT OVER THE YEARS WHERE. YOU KNOW COMPANIES GET THERAPY KIND OF SPREAD OF RISK OUT OF WHACK I MEAN. THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE A CERTAIN SPREADABLE AT ROOM OF RISK FEEL FOR SOLVENCY ISSUES ALSO FOR THE REINSURERS AND MOST THESE COMPANIES ARE. SUBSTANTIALLY REINJURED ITEM THAT GETS OUT OF WHACK SOMETIMES JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE BIG LOSS EVENTS PAR AGENTS OR BROKERS ARE PUSHING THOSE ENVELOPES WE WANT TO SELL INSURANCE. SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS COMPANIES HAVE TO BALANCE OUT IS AS YOU'VE HEARD SOME COMPANIES MOVE OUT AND OTHERS MOVE IN AND WE HOPE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HOPEFULLY OUR WITNESSES CONVICT EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. WE ALSO HEARD. A LITTLE BIT LAST WEEK I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BETTER HEARING. IS JACKSON OF YOUR COMMITTEE ABOUT INSURANCE RATES IN ABOUT I THINK FROM A COMMISSIONER. A PICKER ABOUT COMPANIES. INSURANCE COMPANIES. LEAVING THE MARKETPLACE RISK ARE CHARGING YOU KNOW SUBSTANTIAL RATES. ARE MULTIPLES OF OF RATES. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING. CALIFORNIA'S YOU'VE HEARD IT'S A. PAID A PRE APPROVAL RATE STATE SO UNLESS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN IN THE QUEUE GO TO ANOTHER CARRIER AND I CARRIER HAS A DIFFERENT RATE AT FIVE. MIGHT WILL HAVE DIFFERENT COVERAGES AND THAT TYPE OF THING AND THAT'S WHAT REFLECTS THAT THAT DIFFERENCE IN COVERAGE I THINK THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL. IN TERMS OF NOT CREATING AN AVAILABILITY SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA WHERE ONE WOULD KNOW THE LIES HOPE EXIST EXAMPLE IS THE COMMISSIONERS RECENTLY NOTIFIED INSURERS. THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL TAX RATES OF CHANGE FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT AND. HE CAN OR SHOULD COMEY IS COMING IN FOR A RATE REDUCTION HOLE AFTER BRING LOSSES LIKE THAT THAT'S PRETTY DAUNTING ON THE OTHERS ON THE OTHER HAND. CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY TWO STATES THAT BASICALLY SO THAT AN INCREASE IN YOUR RE INSURANCE RATES IS NOT A JUSTIFICATION TO SUPPORT A RATE INCREASE. NO THE RETURNS RATES ARE GOING UP BY YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY PERCENT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS COULD BE. HILL LIKE THIRTY PERCENT SO DEAL THAT MAY WELL CREATE THE KIND OF AVAILABILITY SITUATION WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE. WITHOUT ALL AND I'D LIKE TO. I INTRODUCED SOME ROB HERE WHO IS NOW WITH THE GEORGE PETERSON INSURANCE AGENCY IN SANTA ROSA. GOOD ARTICULAR MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON SIR. MY NAME IS ROBBIE I'M WITH GEORGE PETERSON INSURANCE. IN SANTA ROSA. WORRY I'D REGIONAL INDEPENDENT BROKER WITH TWELVE OFFICES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IRONICALLY ALL VERY RURAL PLACES. SANTA ROSA'S THE MOST METROPOLITAN. AREA WERE IN WORD FOR BRAG EUREKA. UKIAH READYING AUBURN PLACES LIKE THAT WHERE. WHERE? ARE ALL VERY VERY. BAD HAS IT WILL BE A WILDFIRE HAS A PRONE AREAS. WE'VE GOT. WE READ APPROXIMATELY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN IN BRITAIN PREMIUM THROUGH OUR AGENCY. WE'VE WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. PERSONAL LINES POLICY HOLDERS. MOST OF THOSE HAVE HAVE HOMES. AND THE  <u><c.green>YOU KNOW WHEN WE</c></u> EXPERIENCE THE. THE UNIMAGINABLE. ON OCTOBER NINTH. WHEN I GOT TO THE OFFICE ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. ON ON THE NIGHTS. WE HAD NO NO POWER THE POWER CAME BACK AND WE HAD WE BARELY LIVED LONG WITH WITH THEIR NET. WITH ABOUT EIGHT PEOPLE OF OVER EIGHTY FIVE EMPLOYEES WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT INTO WORK EVERYBODY ELSE WAS EVACUATED. OR YOU KNOW JUST TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WAS GOING ON WE HAD FOUR OF OUR EMPLOYEES I LOSE HOMES. AND. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF OTHER. FRIENDS IN AND CLIENTS THAT THAT THAT. SUFFERED TREMENDOUS LOSSES WELL FOR THAT FOR THIS EVENT THAT HAPPENED THAT THE TUBS FIRE WE WE HAD A. PROXIMATE IN NINETEEN HUNDRED CLAIMS THROUGH OUR OFFICE. AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR TOTAL LOSSES SO. THE LAST NUMBER I HAD A. WEEK TO TEN DAYS AGO UP MY OFFICE ALONE IS SUFFERED A ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND AND LOSSES FOR WITH OUR CLIENTS SO. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN? SINCE THIS HAPPENED IS IT IS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM THE INSURANCE CARRIERS. BAY HAVE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB. STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE FROM FROM REALLY THAT FIRST DAY. WE WE ACTUALLY HOUSED A. SHE INSURANCE ADJUSTERS FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT TURNS COMPANIES DURING THAT FIRST WEEK WHILE THEY WERE DODD DEPLOYING A CAT TEAMS AND TRY TO GET THEM SET UP PLACES SO. SO WE HAD HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF. INSURERS THROUGH OUR OFFICE. TIM TO MEET THOSE ADJUSTERS. FILED THEIR FIRST NOTICES OF OF CLAIM AND GET ADVANCES ON THEIR MONEY. YEAH IF WE IF WE SAW SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE THROUGH THAT FIRST WEEK. MIGHT MY BEST GUESS WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED AND WE'RE NOT EVEN OUR CLIENTS THEY WERE JUST TOLD TO COME THERE THERE'S AN ADJUSTER GO THERE GET OME MONEY AND AND. YOU GET SOME ITS MIGHT KEEP THINGS GOING SO. THE E. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT. THE THE AT THE CONCEPT OF. IN BIG THE NON RENEWAL NOTICES THAT THAT'S COME UP YOU KNOW QUITE OFTEN TODAY I'M. WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THAT. YOU KNOW I WAS TO TALKING TO JOHN EARLIER WE HAD WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTEEN NON RENEWALS COME FROM ONE CARRIER. STRICTLY BASED ON YOU KNOW FIRE FIRE RISK. THAT WAS ALMOST ALMOST FOUR WEEKS AGO AS OF THIS MORNING WERE WERE WERE CERTAIN THAT WE'VE WE FOUND A HOME FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED OF THOSE THOSE THOSE OUR CLIENTS. ANOTHER THING WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING IS. JUST RE UNDERWRITING WITH SOME OF OUR. SO OF OUR. OUR CARRIERS ARE JUST WANTING TO DO RE INSPECTIONS. WHAT WHAT THAT INVOLVES FOR US IS IS GOING OUT? INSPECTING THE PROPERTY OTHER THERE COULD BE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF INNOCENT SOME MITIGATION THAT TYPE OF STUFF BUT. IT WILL WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE SINCE THE THE TUBS FIRES WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN THREE NEW CARRIERS THAT THAT OUR OUR OFFICE IN PARTICULAR IS WORKING WITH SO. ALTHOUGH SOME CARRIERS ARE. DIG UP TO MUCH CONCENTRATION OF RISK AND. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THAT THE THAT THE INSURANCE IF THEY ARE WRITING. THERE ARE NEW CARRIERS INTO CARES POINT THAT ARE COMING IN AND. AND WANTING TO TO WRITE THE BUSINESS SO. BEEN DOING AS A STRATEGY IS? YOU KNOW. YEAH WE'RE CERTAINLY HANDLING THE CLAIMS THAT WE'VE GOT UMPS VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AND EMOTIONAL PROCESS FOR FOR NOT ONLY OUR STAFF EQUIPMENT ESPECIALLY FOR CLIENTS. BUT YOU KNOW WE WE'VE ACTUALLY DIEM GEARED UP OUR STAFF AND AND WERE. YOU KNOW DOING A LOT A LOT OF COVERAGE REVIEWS IN THOSE CASES ITEM WORK OR INCREASING. DWELLING VALUES. IT A LOT OF THOSE CASES CARRIERS ARE BALKING AT IT PROVIDING MORE COVERAGE IN THOSE SAME AREAS. AND THEN. YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE STRUCTURED ON THE POLICIES THAT WE WROTE AND AND AND. WE WROTE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD GOOD POLICIES FOR PEOPLE AND AND A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS THANKING US FOR THE WORK THAT WE DID AND SELLING OF SUCH A GOOD POLICY. WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY SOMEHOW OF A VERY LARGE UPTICK IN NEW POLICIES UMP FOR OUR AGENCY TO SO TO I'VE I FEEL LIKE. SOME OF THE CARRIERS THAT WERE WORKING WITH AS WELL AS OUR AGENCY OR FILLING A GAP FOR SOME OF THOSE. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING OUT THERE. BUT YEAH I IN IS IT AS FAR AS THE UNDER INSURANCE GOES OUT THAT'S ARM YOU. WON'T WE CERTAINLY HERE A LOT OF THAT AND IN SOME COUNTY SANTA ROSA. FORTUNATELY FOR A FOR OUR AGENCY. WE HAVE NOT SEEN A LOT OF THAT WE WE'VE GOT A MEAL LESS THAN A HANDFUL OF SITUATIONS WHERE. THERE'S THERE'S. SOME TALK ABOUT UNDER INSURANCE ARE THERE'S BEEN SOME CASES WHERE. IT COULD BE CONTENTS WERE SOMEBODY STARTED A HOME BUSINESS DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT IT AND IF IT YOU KNOW ACCUMULATED EIGHTY THOUSAND HOURS INVENTORY THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT AND AND THEY ADMITTEDLY DIDN'T TELL US. BOB BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN A. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF UNDER INSURANCE WITH THE NINETEEN HUNDRED CLAIMS IT THAT WE'VE HAD. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY. DUE TO THE PROCESS THAT WE WE DO WHEN WE WHEN WE GO AND RIGHT ACCOUNT WE WE DO RUN THE REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATORS OR REFERENCE EARLIER. IN SOME CASES I DON'T YOU KNOW BASED ON TALKING WITH OUR CLIENTS. WE MAY FEEL THAT THAT THOSE REPLACEMENT COST US METERS AT THE CARRIER DID ART ARE STILL LOS THOSE WHO WILL BUMP BUMP LIMITS AS WELL. AND AND MOST OF THE CARES THAT WE WRITE WITH. WILL OFFER AT LEAST A FIFTY PERCENT EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST AND AND. A HANDFUL CARES WE WRITE WILL OFFER A HUNDRED PERCENT ADDITIONAL EXTEND REPLACEMENT COST SO. HIM ARE OUR CLIENTS HAVE BEEN VERY VERY WELL COVERED IN AND. YOU KNOW. I GUESS IN CLOSING YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT PANICKED WE'VE WE'VE. YOU KNOW WERE WERE HIRING PEOPLE WERE. LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY ACQUIRING SOME SOME OTHER AGENCIES BUT. NOW WE'RE SEEING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO. HIM. KEEP DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING AND AND HELP IN THE PEOPLE THAT DID. FIT OTHER TRUSTED US TO PROTECT EVERYTHING THEY'VE WORKED THEIR WHOLE LIFE FOR.

WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE NUMBER OF HOMEOWNER POLICIES ENSURE THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET IN CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY DOUBLED FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMEOWNERS POLICIES PLACED AND KEPT IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN SURPLUS LINES. THE NUMBER OF TOTAL HOMEOWNER POLICIES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND. TWENTY THREE NINE SEVENTY TO BE EXACT REPRESENTED PROXY APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL SURPLUS LINES POLICIES WRITTEN IN THE STATE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE TOTAL WRITTEN PREMIUM OF A FOR SURPLUS LINES HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPRESENTED UP APPROXIMATELY SEVEN TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT. OF ALL SURPLUS LINES PREMIUMS IN THE STATE. ACCORDING TO THE SLA STATISTICS AND STATISTICS AVAILABLE FROM THE CD I. A SURPLUS LINES PREMIUMS PROCESS THAT YOUR ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT. OF ALL HOMEOWNERS ROB PREMIUMS WRITTEN IN CALIFORNIA. SO YOU CAN TELL FROM THE NUMBERS IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR HOMEOWNERS POLICIES TO GO INTO THE SURPLUS LINES MARKETPLACE. HOWEVER IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE HOMEOWNERS TO HAVE A SURPLUS LINES. OPTION WHEN ADMITTED INSURERS MAKE A BUSINESS DECISION TO REDUCE THEIR LOS EXPOSURES IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. IF ADMITTED CARRY WILL NOT INSURE THE REST CONSUMERS MUST LOOK TO THE SURPLUS LINES MARKETPLACE OR THE FAIR PLAN. OR GO UNINSURED. AND GOING ON INSURED AS WE KNOW IS AN OUTCOME W. DESIRES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INCREASE EVER FROM ROUGHLY ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SURPLUS LINE HOMEOWNER POLICIES PLACED IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY THIRTEEN. TO NEARLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS DRIVEN IN NO SMALL PART BY WILDFIRES. WELL WE DO NOT SPECIFICALLY HOMEOWNERS POLICIES ARE ISSUED. WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT INDICATE CORRELATION BETWEEN FIRES AND THE ISSUANCE OF SURPLUS LINE HOMEOWNER POLICIES. THE MASSIVE FIRES IN RECENT MONTHS AND IT CONTINUED TREND TOWARD SURPLUS. HOMEOWNER POLICIES BEING ISSUED IN FIRE PRONE AREAS POINT IN THIS DIRECTION. IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INTENT OF STATE CALIFORNIA ADMITTED INSURERS MUST HAVE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY AT PROVIDING INSURANCE TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AND THIS IS RIGHT AND PROPER THE SURPLUS LINE INDUSTRY'S ROLE IS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE WHERE IS OTHERWISE UNAVAILABLE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THIS OPTION FOR CALIFORNIANS. FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT INSURANCE PROVIDERS IN THE ADMITTED MARKET. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY AND WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. SELECT ALSO I INTRODUCED SYLVIA ANALYSIS FROM OUR FIRM SYLVIA'S THE DIRECTOR OF PERSONAL INSURANCE FOR A BIRDS WILCOXON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TWENTY TWO. YEAR VETERAN OF. PERSONAL INSURANCE BUT PRINCIPALLY HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE THE NIGHT OF NEEDED MARKET AND SHE AND I BOTH BE HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SO. WELL LET ME ASK YOU TO IS YOUR ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO. VOTE TO THE REMARKS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO DO HOMEOWNERS PRIMARILY. I DO I DO HOMEOWNERS AND COULD YOU SHARE WITH US THEN OF YOUR EXPERIENCE I I BELIEVE MISTER BURNETT SAID THAT. ONLY ABOUT POINT FIVE PERCENT OF THE INSURANCE YOU RIGHT IS HOMEOWNERS OF OBSERVERS LINES OF SURPLUS MONEY TO. OBSERVER GEMS AS THE CALIFORNIA YEAH RIGHT. CAKE COULD COULD YOU. PERHAPS OFFICE WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY WE DO HAVE ADMITTED MARKETS AND ON ADMITTED MA I SEE THAT WE DO WRITE ABOUT HALF OF IT ADMITTED AND HALF OF IT ON A MINUTE SO FAR NOT BY ADMITTED MARKETS. WILL NOT WRITE THE REST THEN WE DO HAVE TO GO NOT ADMITTED BUT WE ALWAYS TRY TO FIND A PLACEMENT AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DOES THE. THE DO YOU ADMITTED MARKET FOLKS GENERALLY NOT ACCEPT THE RISK THAT REQUIRES THAT YOU GO TO THE. TO THE SURPLUS MARKET. THE MAIN RISK IS THE EITHER THE WILDFIRE LOCATION. OR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOME A LOT OF TIMES WE'LL SEE HOMES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED OR SEVERAL LOSSES USUALLY WATER LOSSES ARE ONES THAT. MAKE YOU GO INTO A NON ADMITTED MARKET. THAT'S A THAT'S FROM LOOKING FOR WHAT WOULD MAKE A HOME GO INTO THE NON. SAYS COULD. UPDATES OF A HOME A LOT OF TIMES IT WOULD SHAKE ROOF WILL NOT ALLOW IT TO GO TO BE ADMITTED MARKET. AND THE LOCATION. PATRICIA K. ARE SO I HAVE I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I I AM SERVICE MISTER A NOR WOULD WHICH TO RESPOND TO THE SUGGESTION. THAT WE SHOULD OPEN UP THE STATE TO SOME OF THESE. OTHER NON STATE BASED. A MARKET SO OR I SHOULD SAY INSURANCE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE COMPETITION I GUESS IS THE SUGGESTION. WELL I THINK THAT THERE'S A VERY GOOD BALANCE RIGHT NOW AND. IT WOULD SHOULD BUT IT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE BY AND LARGE COMFORTABLE WITH NOT ADMITTED% INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE THERE IS KIND OF A LINE THERE ARE THAT. THERE'S SEVERAL LINES OF INSURANCE THAT EVERYBODY AGREES THAT. THERE'S NO ADMITTED COVERAGE FOR SO THE COMMISSIONER ALLOWS. AGENTS AND BROKERS TO PLACE BUSINESS IN THOSE MARKETS WITHOUT THE DECLINATIONS ON THE OTHER LINES THEY HAVE TO GET DECLINATIONS AS INDICATED. THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET IS A VERY SMALL ZEAL SEGMENT OF THE OVERALL MARKET AS. YOU KNOW TIM TESTIFIED TO SO I AM REALLY THERE'S A GREAT BALANCE THERE NOW AND I THINK THAT. THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET MARKET PRIMARILY SERVES THESE AND IT HILL SPECIALTY RIPS THINGS THAT HE THERE ARE AROUND. HIM MULTI SIT MULTI STATE RISKS I'M. YOU KNOW LOVE YA HIGH HIGH RISK ESPECIALLY RISKS THAT THE ADMITTED MARKET HIM DOESN'T ONE RIGHT SO IT WE WE THINK THE BOUNCE IS VERY GOOD AND THEY ARE NOW IN THE PROTECTIONS ARE THERE. I THINK ONE OF THE WITNESSES INDICATED THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NOT ADMITTED MARKET BECAUSE THOSE COMPANIES DON'T HAVE A STATE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION. ARE ACTUALLY VIEW LOOK AT THE RECORDS ARE NOT ADMITTED MARKET. TRADITIONALLY IS BEEN STRONGER NO YOU KNOW IT IS ABOUT HERE IS ABOUT. DESIRABILITY I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT HERE ONE OF THE WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT WAS THE COULD STICKS AND HAVING DATA THIS AND THAT. ALTERNATE FOR EASTER BASED INSURANCE RATES ARE BASED ON DATA. IF HER SMALLER COMPANY YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA OF YOUR OWN YOU GO TO IDEA SO INSURANCE SERVICES OFFICE AND THEY CAN GET YOU INFORMATION CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC. INFORMATION AND THAT'S HOW YOU DEVELOP YOUR RATES. YOU CAN'T. IN THAT MARKETPLACE COME UP WITH A SUGGESTION FOR A DISCOUNT OR AND AN INCREASE OF SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ACTUAR WE VIABLE THE YOU CAN'T PROVE TO THE COMMISSIONER HAS A. HAS AN EFFECT ON YOUR RATES SO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY HAVING HIM REPOSITIONING. NO FIRE FACILITA FACILITIES. NO HAVING A MITIGATION OF AROUND YOUR HOME OR YOU KNOW FOREST. LAND MANAGEMENT THINGS ALL ALL THAT WELL. UNTIL THE THOSE ARE PROVEN TO HAPPEN UNTIL THERE'S SOME HISTORY THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY SAVED. STRUCTURES MONEY. HIM HAVE MADE THE EVENTS. WILL. FEEL LESS CATASTROPHE THAN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD BE HE. CAN'T TECHNICALLY PUT THOSE AND YOUR RATES SO YOU KNOW IT IT. IT IS A. YOU KNOW AS WELL SWINGS OR IS A CATCH TWENTY TWO SOMETIMES. WELL I WILL TELL YOU IT'S A THOMAS FIERY OBSERVED IT TO. THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS WERE PRE POSITIONED IN SAINT. HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF HOMES. THAT WE'RE IN THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CATEGORY AND IN FACT PROBABLY ARGUABLY SAVED A GOOD PORTION OF THE CITY SANTA BARBARA THE ESTIMATED. HAD THEY NOT PRE POSITIONED HAD THE FIRE DONE WHAT IT. COULD VERY LIKELY DONE THE. COST WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS SO BUT NO DOUBT PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE FACTORED IN PREVENTION IS ALWAYS WORTH A POUND OF CURE. I WOULD MENTION A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA IS AS MUCH. IF NOT MORE DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE INDUSTRY. SO I'M I'M LOOKING FOR WAYS AND WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT HOW REGULATION IS DESTROYING THE MARKET BUT THE MARKET SEEMS RATHER ROTH BUSTED IN THE SUGGESTION. PERHAPS AT YOU LET OTHER COMPANIES IN THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY REGULATED THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT COULD AND ID EITHER SO I'M I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. JUST A HOW EXACTING ACCURATE THESE THESE CONCERNS ARE BUT. CLEARLY WE ARE SEEING SOME COMPANIES GO OUT I THINK WE SHOULD JERRY MENTIONED. THAT YOU WERE OF THAT THERE WERE A HUNDRED FIFTEEN NON RENEWALS BUT THEY'RE THROWN THREE NEW CARRIERS WHO HAVE JOINED CAN YOU EXPLAIN IS THERE ANY EXPLANATION FOR THAT ARE THESE GLUTTONS FOR PUNISHMENT OR DO THEY STILL FEEL THAT THEY CAN. THEY CAN MAKE MONEY. HELD US UP WRITING INSURANCE IN THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE. THE NON RENEWALS WERE. WERE. DUE TOA OVER CONCENTRATION BY THAT PARTICULAR CARRIER IN A CERTAIN. IN A CERTAIN FIRE PRONE AREAS SO. EVEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS IS NEW CARRIERS COMING IN THE MARKETPLACE AND THEY'LL TAKE SOME OF THAT. BUT THEY'RE ALSO GONNA GO OUT TO THE. THAT THE LAST FIRE PRONE AREAS IT AND AND TAKE THEIR SURE THAT BUSINESS AS WELL AND COMPETE FOR THAT SO. I THINK. DIEM. IT IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NEW TO THE AREA BELT THERE WILLING TO TAKE SOME AT HIGHER RISKS. BUSINESS TO US TO GET INTO THE MARKETPLACE. PART THANK YOU OF ITS ANY QUESTION SENATOR GLAZERS. THE COUPLE BRIEF QUESTIONS THAT MR HERE I DIDN'T. I HEAR YOUR TESTIMONIAL LOW WAS A SHARED WITH ME AND. THAT I WAS HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN OR HUNDRED AND FIFTEENS THAT NOT RENEWED. BUT AND YOU FOUND PLACEMENTS FOR HUNDRED WHAT HAPPEN TO THE OTHER FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN. WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THOSE I MEAN THAT THAT THAT JUST HAPPENED WEEK WE GOT THAT NOTICE. THREE FOUR WEEKS AGO SO THAT WAS FROM A SINGLE COMPANY ONE SINGLE COMPANY AND WOULD YOU IDENTIFY THAT COMPANY. GRANGE INSURANCE AGAIN RANGE IN FRENCH OKAY. ALL RIGHT IN WITH YOUR WE'VE WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF. OTHER OTHER RE UNDERWRITING. NOTICES TO WORK WHERE COMPANIES ARE GONNA COME OUT WE INSPECT. THEY MAY THEY MAY. WANT THE HOMEOWNERS TO DO CERTAIN THINGS TO STAY ON THOSE RISKS BUT. YOU WERE ACTIVELY. PURSUING OTHER MARKETS FOR THOSE RISKS AS WELL OKAY GREAT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK IN HELPING THOSE HOMEOWNERS OUT. I MISTER CLACKLINE CLINICALLY. I JUST HAVE TO ASK YOU KNOW ME CURIOUS MINDS WANT TO KNOW WHAT. YOUR FATHER IN LAW DID GET INSURANCE AND FROM WHO CAN COME AYE SHE DOESN'T CONSULT WITH ME AND IT'S INSURANCE NEEDS BUT HE DOES HAVE INSURANCE CURRENTLY. I WAS OUT IN THE SURPLUS MARKET BY ANY CHANCE OF YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HIS HIS HOUSE. WAS WITH BRAND PUBLIC HUNDRED FEET OF FOR THE FIRE CAME DOWN THROUGH CALISTOGA CON YOU CAN FALL THAT WAS MOVING SO FAST DEFAULT THE WATER LINES CREEK LINES RATHER GOING UP THE RIDGES WHERE HIS HOUSE WAS. A BUT I'M PRETTY SURE I COULD SET HIS HOUSE ON FIRE WITH A CIGARETTE IT'S. RIGHT CLICK COMBUSTIBLE EDISON. THE OTHER EAR SO ENCOURAGING. I MUST HAVE A GREAT GREAT THANKSGIVING DINNER. BUT BUT BUT DID YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE GOT ON THE SURPLUS LINER ARE NOW I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY SEEK TO THAT. BUT TODAY I SPEAK UP. WHAT THIS MAN WHETHER THAT HOUSES IN THE SURPLUS LINES? YEAH SURE. IT IN IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IS NOT. NINE. YEAH IT'S IT BECAUSE I REALLY WANNA MAKE THE POINT ABOUT THE THE THE THE HIGH DEGREE OF UNDERWRITING ECHOES AND A SURPLUS LINES AND I GOT IT. RIGHT COULD I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION THAT IT MEANS IT I SUGGEST SOMETHING AND I JUST WAS CURIOUS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT THIS WAS MY FIRST THAT INSURANCE COMMITTEE MEETING AND IT WAS. QUITE EXCITING. YEAH. I KEY PA WITH THINK THAT LOUIS HUPP. GIVING THE SENSE MADAM CHAIR ON HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET. THAT THERE'S NOTHING. SEE HERE MOVE ON. UM EVERYTHING'S. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT AS A LEGISLATOR WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY AND WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND. QUESTION. LIKELY TO BE FOR FUN I'M SPEAKING FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY DIVERT TALK ABOUT INSURANCE ISSUES BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS PERSONALLY I THINK WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR FORESTS. BUT IN THE ITEM I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED DEALING WITH FIRE. THREE OF SEVENTEEN DEALING WITH INSURANCE BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A. FOLKS ARE LOOKING A LOT MORE pANYONE ELSE. AND JUST BECAUSE EARLIER EARLIER MY CONCERN IS THAT WE DON'T CREATE AVAILABILITY SITUATION WHERE ONE MAYBE DOESN'T EXIST AND. YOU KNOW BY ESSENTIALLY INTO THE IMPOSING MANDATES ON JURORS THAT THERE ARE TIME RESPONDING TO. HERE WE TALKED COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE. THE ISSUE OF REINSURANCE MEAN OFTENTIMES THE SMALL COMPANIES. I MEAN THERE COULDN'T HAVE THEIR DIRECTED IN PART BY THEIR YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN OBTAIN REINSURANCE I HAD ONE OF OTHER CLIENTS WHO TALKED ME ABOUT. AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND THREE FIRES THAT THEIR IMAGE THEIR REINSURER ASKING DAY CANCEL. THEY'LL SEVERAL THOUSAND POLICIES ARE NOT RENEW SEVERAL THOUSAND POLICY BECAUSE THE REINSURER THOUGHT THEY WERE. YOU KNOW OVER EXPOSED SO THEY DID THAT THOSE POLICIES WERE CERTAINLY TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE BUTTERMILK THAT'S THAT'S A FACTOR IN ALL THIS OR NOT TALKING ABOUT. REINSURANCE IS A WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON HEALED IT'S CRITICAL FOR COMPANIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND AS I SAID EARLIER WE DON'T HAVE. GET WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE RATE PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA HAS A REASON TO SUPPORT A RATE INCREASE OF RETURNS COSTS GO UP. YOU KNOW ENDED SAME TIME COMPANIES ARE ASKED TO. IN A REDUCED RATES BECAUSE OF FEDERAL TAX LAWS YOU IN THE STATE. YOU THINK YOU MANAGER. BESIDES LIKE TO. I APPRECIATE YOUR OBSERVATION ABOUT MANAGING OUR FORESTS I HAVE A BILL ON THAT THIS YEAR. HAD. I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE. I THINK THERE'S VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSING A LOT OF THIS THESE WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT ARE CREATING THE PROBLEM SO. I THINK ON ALL SIDES FROM ALL DIFFERENT POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION THOUGH I'M I'M STILL KIND OF PUZZLED. NO THE. THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE DECIMATED INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND I REMEMBER QUITE VIVIDLY AND. DRIVING DOWN VENTURA BOULEVARD ACTUALLY. IN THE VALLEY YOU KNOW THE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN PARTICULAR AND THE RESIDENCES OF. PURCHASE GET OFF THEIR FOUNDATIONS AND HAD TO BE REBUILT AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO. HOW DOES THE THE NEW RISK OF THESE? NEARLY MEGA FIRES DIFFER FROM THE RISK THAT WE SAW AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WHEN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WAS VIRTUALLY DECIMATED HERE WE'RE HAVING THESE MAJOR EVENTS AND YET. THE INDUSTRY IS SEEMS TO BE QUITE ROBUST WELL HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT. AYE AYE I'LL TAKE THAT I I THINK IN SOME RESPECTS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY LEARNED FROM NORTHRIDGE A THEY WERE OVER EXPOSED AND PART OF THAT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE MANDATE. STATUTORY MANDATES THAT THEY MUST OFFER EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE SO THAT. PREVENTED THEM FROM HAVING THE ABILITY TO REALLY MANAGE THEIR RISK AND WITH THAT AS A RESULT YOU DID WIND UP WITH OVER EXPOSURE. HERE. THERE ARE NO MANDATES. I THINK IF YOU HAD MANDATE SEATS YOU'D COULD SEE SOMETHING VERY. MUCH LIKE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER NORTHRIDGE INSURERS THERE'S I THINK BECAUSE THE REASON THOSE AVAILABILITY RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE INSURANCE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT THEIR EXPOSURE THEY ARE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR RISK. AND OTHER INSURERS WITH THAT CAN WRITE IN THIS AREAS ARE COMING IN. ANY OTHER THOUGHTS YOU WANTED TO GATHERS NUMBER THREE IMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT'S REALLY DRIVING THE. INTENSE COMPETITION AVAILABILITY FOR INSURANCE NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA GLOBALLY AND THAT'S A CAPITAL CAPACITY. THERE'S DIMINISH NOT CAPITAL GLOBAL CAPACITY AVAILABLE IN THE WORLD THAT'S FUNNY NEEDS A PLACE TO GO. AND IT'S IT FINDS ITS WAY TO THE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE. WHICH CREATES A COMMENCEMENT OF A COMPETITION. FOR RETURN ON CAPITAL. AND SO IT'S RATE IT IT'S VERY MUCH A CAPITAL DRIVEN. THE OPPORTUNITY. COURIER TODAY COMPARED TO TWENTY. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. ALRIGHT WELL THAT. I THINK THIS IS GOOD NEWS TIME GOV APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND ALL OF YOU AND. ANALYSTS ARE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS LET'S GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE WE CONCLUDE AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. THERE ANY OF ANY PUBLIC. THIRTY ONE ELECTED BOARD TEN SURE CUP SENATE INTERESTS AND ENGAGEMENT IN THIS ISSUE AND SO MANY OTHERS AND ARE IN REGARD TO. SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY AND CERTAINLY THANKING THE STAFF OF OUR BOTH OUR COMMITTEES FOR OTHER GOOD WORK IN PREPARING. ARE ARE. FOR INFORMATION ON THIS IN THE WONDERFUL WITNESSES BUT HERE'S UP WHEN A SPARK. A LITTLE LAUGH. I THOUGHT ON. IN THIS WAY. THAT. WE TALK ABOUT OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT IN SO MANY WAYS. I AM ANY TALK ABOUT THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF FOR. THE TREES OUT THERE WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A SELF INFLICTED WOUND THAT I SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S A REVOLVING AROUND URBAN FORESTS. URBAN FORESTS. WE LOVE OUR TREES WE LOVE THE SHADE WE KNOW THAT THAT CREATES A GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BUT. YOU CAN GO LOOK IN THE OAKLAND HILLS TODAY. AND SEE A LOT OF EUCALYPTUS TREES ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND YOU CAN SEE THE FIGHTS ABOUT WHETHER A TREE EUCALYPTUS TREES SAVED OR REMOVED. AND NOW PARTS OF MY DISTRICT IT YOU HAVE TO PAY BIG AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO REMOVE A TREE. IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE A TREE BECAUSE THESE OUT ONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND THE QUALITY OF LIFE COMES FROM HAVING THIS WONDERFUL TREE CANOPIES AND. I APPRECIATE THAT TOO AND I LOVE IT IN MY AREA. BUT WE HAVE TO GO IN AND RE CHECK THAT AND READ RETEST THAT THINKING. I'D GIVEN THIS. THIS ISSUE OF OF THESE OUT OF CONTROL FIRES. WERE THESE TREES ONLY MAKE IT WORSE AND CERTAINLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN SEE PLACES. ALONG THE COAST AND EVEN PLACES THAT. HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FIRE WILL FIGHT YOU TOOTH AND NAIL ABOUT REMOVING. TREE SO IT IS I WANT TO SPARK A LITTLE THOUGHT ON. ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE. WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR RISK REDUCTION EVERYWHERE INCLUDING EVEN IN THE COMMUNITIES AND EVEN IF IT AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT WE SO MUCH TREASURE IN OUR OWN. HOME TOWNS. FURTHERMORE LA LOOKING SAKE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO RESPOND BRIEFLY TO THAT YOU KNOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WITH THE FACT WE'RE SPEWING CARBON INTO OUR AIR THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A TREE IN OUR BACKYARD. THE IS VERY SAD STATEMENT ABOUT. WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE'VE COME BOTH POLITICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY I HOPE THAT ISN'T THE CASE BECAUSE FOR? MANY OF US OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE. REALLY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE THE NATURAL BEAUTY AND AND. YOU KNOW TREES ALSO WERE A GREAT SOURCE OF COMFORT SHADE. GREENHOUSE GAS OF REDUCTION. IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CN TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. OF WHAT WE ARE DOING THAT'S CAUSING THE SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING AND. I'D DO WHAT WE CAN TO TO ADDRESS IT IN A PROACTIVE WAY RATHER THAN BE. REACTIVE TO IT. THAT BEING SAID WE DO HAVE. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE CALIFORNIA KEEP CALIFORNIA THE. MAGNIFICENT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND IT IS AND I DO APPRECIATE THE TIME AND THE EFFORT THAT PEOPLE SPEND HERE TODAY TO JOIN US ARE. BY TYING DO APPRECIATED THE STATEMENTS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. FEELING FAIRLY CONFIDENT ABOUT ITS FUTURE. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CAN AGAIN BALANCE. OF THE NEEDS OF OUR OUR CONSUMERS WHICH WAS MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING. OF WITH THE HOW WE MAINTAIN A ROBUST MARKETPLACE SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT CONSUMERS. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE IS GOING TO BUY A HOUSE TODAY. UNLESS THEY PAY CASH THAT ISN'T GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT HOUSE SO UNLESS WE WANT PEOPLE THAT TO RECREATE HOOVER VILLE. OF BILLS FROM THE TWENTIES. WE'VE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER AND I HOPE WE FIND THE BEST WAYS TO DO IT IN THE. MOST MEANINGFUL RESOLUTION FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATES WITH THAT. WE'LL RETURN CHAIR CLICK HERE
