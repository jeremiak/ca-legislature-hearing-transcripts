I CAN GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS PATTY MAKE JANET I'M WITH LOS ANGELES -- TO RESUME AND CONVENTION BOARD -- AND WE ARE HERE -- TO GAIN COURAGE YOU. TO MOVE THIS BILL FOR WORK -- WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS QUITE NECESSARY BECAUSE CITIES AND STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE REALLY COME TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS AND IT'S GOT TO BE VERY VERY COMPETITIVE PROCESS. AND SO NOT JUST LARGEST NATIONS LIKE OURSELVES BUT SMALLER DESTINATIONS WITHIN THE STATE REALLY DO NEED ASSISTANCE IN TRYING TO ATTRACT THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN THAT WE WILL CONTINUE. TO FUND RAISE IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR HOST COMMITTEE SIX CENTER BUT THE INCENTIVE -- TO THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO MOVE IT FORWARD IT WILL REALLY BE APPRECIATED AND IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT OF THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR INSTANCE FLORIDA -- HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL TEXAS IN PARTICULAR -- WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE FACT OF LIKE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EVENTS TO THEIR AREA. SO -- THE YOU'LL SEE FLORIDA THE ATLANTA OTHER CITIES STARTING TO REPLICATE THAT AS WELL. AND SO -- THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO SAY IS THAT WE ARE FEELING -- VERY SUPPORTED BY THE OTHER TOURISM OFFICE TO CALIFORNIA'S YOU SEE BY THE SUPPORT LETTERS WE'VE GOT NEARLY FORTY LETTERS THAT CAME IN AGAIN FROM DESTINATIONS BOTH URBAN AND RURAL -- SO WE THINK THAT THERE IS BEING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY THERE IS VERY MUCH WIDE SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT YOU'RE GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WOULD HELP HER PHONE LOS ANGELES THOSE HERE FROM SAN JOSE. YEAH GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CAROLYN KERR KESSLER AND I'M THE CEO VISITS AND I WAS A TEAM SAN JOSE. WE ARE THE OFFICIAL DESTINATION MARKETING ORGANIZATION AND WE ALSO MANAGED TO SAN JOSE MCENERY CONVENTION CENTER ALONG WITH FOUR THEATERS. IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS SAN JOSE IS HOSTED FOR MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS THAT REQUIRED A SIGNIFICANT LOCAL INVESTMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE PARTNERED WITH LEVI STADIUM IN SANTA CLARA TO HOST WRESTLEMANIA THIRTY ONE THIS EVEN COST OUR ORGANIZATION AND THE SPORTS AUTHORITY A TOTAL OF ALMOST ONE MILLION DOLLARS JUST A HOST THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT. SANTA CLARA MIGHT HAVE DONE OR LEVI STADIUM. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ONE SUPER BOWL FIFTY TOOK PLACE IN LEVI STADIUM WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY NINE MILES FROM OUR DOWNTOWN WE INVESTED ALMOST TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS JUST IN SAN JOSE ALONE. I IMAGINE THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S INVESTMENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE MANY OF MUCH OF THE ACTIVATION WAS DONE. THAT EVEN BROUGHT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE BAY AREA. EARLIER THIS YEAR WE HOSTED TWO MAJOR EVENTS JUST WEEKS APART AND IT WAS A REAL FINANCIAL STRAIN FOR US THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS REQUIRED AN OVERALL INVESTMENT OF ALMOST TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. A FEW WEEKS LATER THE NHL ALL STAR GAME TOOK PLACE AND THEY NEED AN INVESTMENT OF ALMOST A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. WELL SO WITH SOME EVENTS THEIR BID FEES INVOLVED IN THERE ARE SOME SMALLER EVENTS THAT OTHER CITIES COULD HOST FOR INSTANCE THE US GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIPS AND CONGRESS -- THIRTEEN TRIALS THEY REQUIRE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR BID FOR YOU JUST TO PUT IN A BAD SO THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL OF THE OTHER -- COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IT WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD MORE OF THESE BUT HONESTLY IT'S A REAL FINANCIAL STRAIN SO WE HAVE -- TO PICK AND CHOOSE WERE ALWAYS COMPETING WITH OTHER STATES I DON'T KNOW OF A TIME WHEN WE'VE ACTUALLY COMPETED WITH ANYONE ELSE IN THE STATE BECAUSE WE DO A GOOD JOB OF SOMEBODY ELSE IS GOING FOR WE TYPICALLY DON'T -- SO WE WE WANT THE BUSINESS AND CALIFORNIA I'VE ONLY GIVEN YOU EXAMPLES OF SPORTING EVENTS BECAUSE THAT'S PARTICULARLY WHAT MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN BUT THERE ARE NOT A DOZENS OF OTHER CULTURAL AGRICULTURAL AND ENTERTAINMENT EVENTS. THAT WOULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THIS THESE EVENTS ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION THEY PROVIDE REVENUES FOR HOTELS RESTAURANTS SHOPPING TRANSPORTATION AND THEY CREATE AND FOSTER INNOVATION AND ENCOURAGE SPILLOVER EFFECTS THAT CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES BY ATTRACTING INVESTMENT. TOURISM CONSUMER SPENDING AND BY GENERATING TAX REVENUE. SO WE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL -- AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TO VOTE IN FAVOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MILITARY STRUCTURE AND MEMBERS BOB YOU'RE ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES RAMS ORGANIZATION IN THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS ORGANIZATION. WOULD LIKE TO THANKS AND REMEMBERED FOR HIS BILL -- I THINK I'D JUST ONE ECHO WITH THE OTHER -- WITNESSES OF SAID BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT MOST OF THESE EVENTS THEIR WEEK LONG EVENTS THEIR WEEK LONG EVENTS THAT BRING IN. A LOT OF REVENUE TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT SPONSOR THEM. IT ALSO GENERATES JOBS. I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PAINTERS DISTRICT COUNCIL THIRTY SIX THAT REPRESENT THE SIGN IN PICTORIAL DISPLAY UNION WORKERS THEY DO ALL THE TRADE SHOWS THEY DO ALL THE LINING IN THE END ZONE PAINTING. FOR ALL THE ATHLETIC EVENTS SO THERE ARE JOBS GENERATED BUT THERE HAS TO BE MONEY ON THE FRONT END. ONE OF THE OTHER EVENTS THAT I WOULD NOTE IS THAT EVERY YEAR THE CITY OF MODESTO HOSTS THE AMERICAN GRAFFITI -- CREWS AND THAT HAS GONE FROM SIX HUNDRED CARS TWO THREE THOUSAND CARDS THIS YEAR THAT IS THE LARGEST REVENUE GENERATOR FOR THE CITY MODESTO AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. SO ON ON MY ORGANIZATIONS BEHALF WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND THINKS AND AMBER.
