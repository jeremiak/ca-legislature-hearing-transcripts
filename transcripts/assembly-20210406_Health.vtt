02:15:27.018 --> 02:15:28.720
IS A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION.

02:15:28.787 --> 02:15:30.422
IN MY CLINICAL PRACTICE I

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:31.256
REGULARLY SEE THAT THESE

02:15:31.323 --> 02:15:32.791
CONDITIONS ARE LINKED FOR THOSE

02:15:32.858 --> 02:15:34.092
OF YOU THAT MAY HAVE FAMILY OR

02:15:34.159 --> 02:15:36.094
FRIENDS WITH ADDICTION I'M SURE

02:15:36.161 --> 02:15:37.629
YOU SEE THE SAME. THE

02:15:37.696 --> 02:15:39.631
DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUBSTANCE

02:15:39.698 --> 02:15:41.233
USE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR

02:15:41.299 --> 02:15:43.401
POLICIES IS REALLY A RELIC OF

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:46.004
AN OUTDATED UNDERSTANDING. THE

02:15:46.071 --> 02:15:47.739
SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR ON THIS

02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:49.307
AND IT'S Y. CROSS THE FIELD IN

02:15:49.374 --> 02:15:51.443
PSYCHIATRY. THERE IS AN

02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:52.844
OPPORTUNITY INTEGRATE MENTAL

02:15:52.911 --> 02:15:54.379
HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:56.348
SERVICES TOGETHER WHICH IS ONE

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:59.417
OF THE THINGS THAT THIS- THAT

02:15:59.484 --> 02:16:01.520
THE STOP- BILL DOES. AT SECOND

02:16:01.586 --> 02:16:02.854
SUBSTANCE USE IS A MAJOR

02:16:02.921 --> 02:16:04.890
COMPLICATING FACTOR FOR MOST

02:16:04.956 --> 02:16:06.925
OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS-

02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:10.328
SO ACROSS THE BOARD WITH EVERY

02:16:10.395 --> 02:16:12.230
ABUSES ASSOCIATED WITH FORCE

02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:13.698
RESPONSE TO TREATMENT MORE

02:16:13.765 --> 02:16:16.535
HOSPITALIZATIONS PLUS RECOVERY

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:18.336
AND AS YOU MAY KNOW PEOPLE WITH

02:16:18.403 --> 02:16:19.371
MENTAL ILLNESS PARTICULARLY

02:16:19.437 --> 02:16:21.306
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DIE ON

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:23.208
AVERAGE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE

02:16:23.275 --> 02:16:24.543
YEARS EARLIER THAN NORMAL. A

02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:25.944
MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS IS

02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:27.979
TOBACCO USE ALCOHOL USE ILLICIT

02:16:28.046 --> 02:16:30.782
DRUG USE HAVING SEPARATIST ARMS

02:16:30.849 --> 02:16:32.284
AND- AND SEPARATE EARLY

02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:35.287
INTERVENTION SYSTEMS JUST MEANS

02:16:35.353 --> 02:16:36.588
PEOPLE SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS.

02:16:36.655 --> 02:16:38.423
AND THIRD I WOULD HIGHLIGHT

02:16:38.490 --> 02:16:40.592
THAT USING SUBSTANCES EARLY IN

02:16:40.659 --> 02:16:43.428
LIFE. INCREASES LIFETIME RISK

02:16:43.495 --> 02:16:45.797
OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. WHEN

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:47.699
IT COMES TO PREVENTION AND

02:16:47.766 --> 02:16:50.168
PARTICULARLY FOR YOU. CHILDREN

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:52.270
IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SEPARATE

02:16:52.337 --> 02:16:54.539
MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE

02:16:54.606 --> 02:16:55.140
PREVENTION IT'S REALLY ONE OF

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:57.976
THE SAME. I THINK AB SIX THIRTY

02:16:58.043 --> 02:17:00.078

BIOTECHNOLOGY. THE NATIONAL

02:23:42.947 --> 02:23:44.916
ACADEMIES COMMITTEE- THAT

02:23:44.983 --> 02:23:46.284
PRODUCERS FOR EXERCISE

02:23:46.351 --> 02:23:48.019
DIFFERENCE IN AGE OF PROPHETIC

02:23:48.086 --> 02:23:51.389
BIOLOGY- AND WE DETERMINED THAT

02:23:51.456 --> 02:23:53.791
IT WAS- THE CONSTRUCTION-

02:23:53.858 --> 02:23:55.994
VIRUSES- SUCH AS USING

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:58.363
SYNTHESIS PRODUCTS- FROM

02:23:58.429 --> 02:24:01.065
SCRATCH THAT- WHAT POST ONE OF

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:02.333
THE MOST PRESSING BIODEFENSE

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.135
RISK THAT THE NATION FACES AT

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:06.671
THIS TIME SO THIS IS A GREAT

02:24:06.738 --> 02:24:08.973
STEP FORWARD FOR BIO SECURITY

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.009
IT ADDRESSES BASIC BIOSECURITY

02:24:11.075 --> 02:24:12.977
GAPS IN OUR CURRENT APPROACH TO

02:24:13.044 --> 02:24:15.613
GENES THAT THAT THE SCREENING-

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:17.782
AS YOU NO JEANS TO THE TEST AND

02:24:17.849 --> 02:24:19.584
OTHER- SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TOOLS

02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:20.985
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:22.887
ADVANCES IN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND

02:24:22.954 --> 02:24:24.555
WE CERTAINLY ENJOYED. THE

02:24:24.622 --> 02:24:26.257

KNOW THE VACCINE DEVELOPMENT

02:24:28.359 --> 02:24:30.495
BUT- BUT OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS

02:24:30.561 --> 02:24:32.597
CAN BE TOO EASILY MISUSED FOR

02:24:32.663 --> 02:24:34.665
CRIME SO THIS BILL PROMOTES

02:24:34.732 --> 02:24:36.434
RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR OF

02:24:36.501 --> 02:24:39.103

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:40.838
RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU'RE TRYING

02:24:40.905 --> 02:24:42.607
TO USE THEIR PRODUCTS. IT

02:24:42.673 --> 02:24:44.842
MAKES- ATTENTION TO BY A

02:24:44.909 --> 02:24:47.779
SECURITY ISSUES AT COMPETITIVE

02:44:53.049 --> 02:44:54.384
THIRTY CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS ARE

02:44:54.451 --> 02:44:56.119
OPPOSED UNLESS THE BILL IS

02:44:56.186 --> 02:44:57.954
AMENDED BECAUSE IN DOING THIS

02:44:58.021 --> 02:44:59.889
WE MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT

02:44:59.956 --> 02:45:02.192
CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

02:45:02.259 --> 02:45:03.560
THAT I BELIEVE WILL HAPPEN WITH

02:45:03.627 --> 02:45:05.262
THE BILL WAS DRAFTED WE HAVE

02:45:05.328 --> 02:45:06.129
OFFERED TO THE CANADIAN

02:45:06.196 --> 02:45:07.597
ALTERNATIVE TO THIS BILL TO

02:45:07.664 --> 02:45:10.333
MEET AFFORDABILITY OBJECTIVES.

02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:11.434
WELL THERE ARE MANY ISSUES I

02:45:11.501 --> 02:45:15.372
HOPE YOU'LL HEAR JUST. THREE

02:45:15.438 --> 02:45:15.939
POINTS TODAY. IT CRITICALLY

02:45:16.006 --> 02:45:17.173
IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE- ABOUT

02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:18.875
WHAT PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO

02:45:18.942 --> 02:45:21.811
SOLVE. IT HEALTHCARE COSTS IT

02:45:21.878 --> 02:45:23.546
HEALTHCARE PRICES THIS BILL

02:45:23.613 --> 02:45:24.914
DOES NOT ADDRESS HEALTH CARE

02:45:24.981 --> 02:45:27.217
COSTS OR PRICES. IT HOW MUCH WE

02:45:27.284 --> 02:45:29.319
SPEND ON HEALTH CARE IS IT HOW

02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:30.754
MUCH WE SPEND PER PERSON ON

02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:32.489
HEALTH CARE. IT SPENDING BY

02:45:32.555 --> 02:45:33.657
CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING BY

02:45:33.723 --> 02:45:36.326
EMPLOYERS THIS BILL AN EXAMPLE

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:38.395
DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

02:45:38.461 --> 02:45:39.996
RATE OF INCREASE IN PREMIUMS

02:45:40.063 --> 02:45:42.232
PAID BY EMPLOYERS. SO THE BILL

02:45:42.299 --> 02:45:45.402
pCRITICAL ISSUE. CALIFORNIA

02:45:45.468 --> 02:45:46.936
SPENDS LESS PER PERSON ON

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:48.505
HOSPITAL CARE FOR EXAMPLE THAN

02:45:48.571 --> 02:45:50.373
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE DESPITE

02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:51.474
HAVING THE THIRD HIGHEST COST

02:45:51.541 --> 02:45:53.209
OF LIVING IN THE NATION. AND

02:45:53.276 --> 02:45:54.377
LABOR COSTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

02:45:54.444 --> 02:45:56.379
ARE GROWING 10% FASTER THE

02:45:56.446 --> 02:45:58.515
NATIONAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING.

02:45:58.581 --> 02:46:00.317
CALIFORNIA'S THREE QUARTERS OF

02:46:00.383 --> 02:46:01.718
WHAT STATE LIKE MASSACHUSETTS

02:46:01.785 --> 02:46:03.520
SPEND PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE

02:46:03.586 --> 02:46:05.522
IF YOU'RE DEFINING THE PROBLEM.

02:46:05.588 --> 02:46:07.190
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE COST

02:46:07.257 --> 02:46:10.660
PRICE DECLINES IN SPENDING PER

02:46:10.727 --> 02:46:12.195
CAPITA IS CRITICAL. CORRECT

02:46:12.262 --> 02:46:14.631
AFFORDABILITY BE RESOLVED THE

02:46:14.698 --> 02:46:16.266
BILL LIMITS TO INCREASE IN

02:46:16.333 --> 02:46:16.966
HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN

02:46:17.033 --> 02:46:18.968
CALIFORNIA. BUT HOW MUCH WE

02:46:19.035 --> 02:46:20.904
SPEND ON HEALTH CARE IS A

02:46:20.970 --> 02:46:22.605
COMBINATION OF BOTH THE COST OF

02:46:22.672 --> 02:46:25.408
CARE AND HOW MUCH CARE WE

02:46:25.475 --> 02:46:27.077
PROVIDE TO FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

02:46:27.143 --> 02:46:28.611
HOW DO WE SEPARATE AND KEEP THE

02:46:28.678 --> 02:46:30.914
GOOD SPENDING FOR EXAMPLE MORE

02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:33.450
FOR PRIMARY CARE MORE FOR AN

02:46:33.516 --> 02:46:34.884
AGING POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA

02:46:34.951 --> 02:46:36.920
AND WALDRON EATING BAD SPENDING

02:46:36.986 --> 02:46:38.922
UNNECESSARY CARE INFLATED DRUG

02:46:38.988 --> 02:46:41.624
PRICES. THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT

02:46:41.691 --> 02:46:43.660
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO

02:46:43.727 --> 02:46:45.395
SO DO WE PROVIDE LESS CARE TO

02:46:45.462 --> 02:46:46.996
THOSE IN NEED IN ORDER TO MEET

02:46:47.063 --> 02:46:48.698
THE SPENDING CAPS. THE BILL

02:46:48.765 --> 02:46:50.100
WILL LIMIT HOW MUCH CALIFORNIA

02:46:50.166 --> 02:46:51.668
SPENDS ON CARE BUT NOT

02:46:51.735 --> 02:46:53.503
NECESSARILY MAKE CARE MORE

02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:54.971
AFFORDABLE FOR A TYPICAL

02:46:55.038 --> 02:46:57.073
CALIFORNIANS. AND FINALLY THE

02:46:57.140 --> 02:46:58.541
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS

02:46:58.608 --> 02:47:00.577
PROPOSAL IS NOT AMENDED ARE

02:47:00.643 --> 02:47:02.712
REAL AND SERIOUS. CAPPING

02:47:02.779 --> 02:47:04.180
HEALTHCARE SPENDING SUGGESTS

02:47:04.247 --> 02:47:06.416
THAT TDAY WE'RE SPENDING THE

02:47:06.483 --> 02:47:06.950
RIGHT AMOUNT IN THE RIGHT

02:47:07.016 --> 02:47:08.885
PLACES. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S

02:47:08.952 --> 02:47:11.020
NOT THE CASE FOR COMMUNITIES

02:47:11.087 --> 02:47:12.422
THAT ARE UNDER RESOURCED

02:47:12.489 --> 02:47:14.357
SPENDING CAPS CAN LOCK IN THAT

02:47:14.424 --> 02:47:16.960
INEQUITY. WE NEED TO SPEND MORE

02:47:17.026 --> 02:47:18.128
ON COVERAGE AND CARE FOR

02:47:18.194 --> 02:47:20.430
UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WE

02:47:20.497 --> 02:47:21.297
NEED TO SPEND MORE ON MENTAL

02:47:21.364 --> 02:47:22.866
HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE-

02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:25.468
CARE FOR MILLIONS IN CALIFORNIA

02:47:25.535 --> 02:47:27.137
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC.

02:47:27.203 --> 02:47:28.872
WHAT IS THE NEXT NEW TECHNOLOGY

02:47:28.938 --> 02:47:31.341
AND WHEN MIGHT THE NEXT DEADLY

02:47:31.408 --> 02:47:32.876
DISEASE ARE PANDEMIC ARRIVE.

02:47:32.942 --> 02:47:34.244
AND HEALTH CARE SPENDING CAP IN

02:47:34.310 --> 02:47:36.479
CALIFORNIA MEANS THAT WE ARE

02:47:36.546 --> 02:47:37.914
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY HEALTH CARE

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:38.982
DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE IN

02:47:39.048 --> 02:47:42.018
WASHINGTON DC NOT CALIFORNIA.

02:47:42.085 --> 02:47:43.987

DECISIONS CAN AFFECT SPENDING.

02:47:54.597 --> 02:47:56.466
AND TRIP THE CALIFORNIA CAP. I

02:47:56.533 --> 02:47:58.301

THE FEDERAL MEDICARE PROGRAM.

02:48:04.441 --> 02:48:05.775
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ARE

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC

02:48:17.454 --> 02:48:19.722

02:58:43.479 --> 02:58:44.880
TIED INTO A SORT OF STANDARDS

02:58:44.947 --> 02:58:48.250

TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER

02:58:49.518 --> 02:58:51.787
THINGS MIGHT EXIST TOMORROW AND

02:58:51.854 --> 02:58:54.223
ON THAT NOTE TO. I JUST ASK YOU

02:58:54.290 --> 02:58:55.891
TO RESPOND TO THE POINT RAISED

02:58:55.958 --> 02:58:58.761
AND I HAVE A FIVE QUESTION BUT-

02:58:58.828 --> 02:59:01.030
IF THEY START HERE- THE POINT

02:59:01.097 --> 02:59:03.165
RAISED ABOUT. THE RELATIONSHIP

02:59:03.232 --> 02:59:04.366
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY GET

02:59:04.433 --> 02:59:05.968
STANDARDS THAT WOULD BE SET

02:59:06.035 --> 02:59:07.803
DOWN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:59:07.870 --> 02:59:09.205
I THINK CURRENTLY OBVIOUSLY

02:59:09.271 --> 02:59:10.973
WERE. IT TEND TO BE IN LINE

02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:12.875
WITH. THE CURRENT FEDERAL

02:59:12.942 --> 02:59:15.111
ADMINISTRATION. BUT THAT MIGHT

02:59:15.177 --> 02:59:16.745
NOT YOU KNOW BASED ON PAST

02:59:16.812 --> 02:59:17.813
EXPERIENCE AND WHAT WE COULD

02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:19.181
ANTICIPATE POSSIBLY IN THE

02:59:19.248 --> 02:59:20.716
FUTURE THAT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE

02:59:20.783 --> 02:59:21.617
THE CASE I'D LIKE TO GET

02:59:21.684 --> 02:59:25.087
RESPONSES. ON ON KIND OF THOSE

02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:25.654
TWO RELATED POINTS. WELL TO

02:59:25.721 --> 02:59:26.822
MAKE IT TO THIS ONE FIRST AND

02:59:26.889 --> 02:59:28.324
THEN I KIND. OF LOST YOU ON THE

02:59:28.390 --> 02:59:30.059
FIRST OKAY FIRST ONE BUT- SO ON

02:59:30.126 --> 02:59:32.061
THE SECOND ONE- YOU KNOW IF

02:59:32.128 --> 02:59:33.729
THERE ARE IF THERE ARE FEDERAL

02:59:33.796 --> 02:59:35.798
RECOMMENDATIONS AND- IT OUT

02:59:35.865 --> 02:59:37.933
THERE- THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.769
FEDERAL LAW AT THIS POINT SO.

02:59:40.836 --> 02:59:42.838
YOU KNOW WE AS A STATE. YOU

02:59:42.905 --> 02:59:44.807
KNOW THE FEDERAL LAW SOMETIMES

02:59:44.874 --> 02:59:46.308
IS THE FLOOR NOT THE CEILING

02:59:46.375 --> 02:59:48.344
AND SO. SO WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY

02:59:48.410 --> 02:59:51.413
NEED IF WE- IF WE WERE IN

02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:53.115
CONFLICT WE WOULD NEED TO.

02:59:53.182 --> 02:59:55.050
RECTIFY THAT IF WE WERE TRYING

02:59:55.117 --> 02:59:57.353
TO BE LESS ARE MORE LENIENT

02:59:57.419 --> 02:59:58.087
THAN THE THAN THE FEDERAL

02:59:58.154 --> 03:00:02.558
GOVERNMENT. SO THE IDEA THAT-

03:00:02.625 --> 03:00:04.426
AND PART OF WHAT I HEARD. IN

03:00:04.493 --> 03:00:06.395
THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY WAS

03:00:06.462 --> 03:00:08.430
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST HAVE

03:00:08.497 --> 03:00:09.899
A COMMISSION IF YOU KNOW THAT

03:00:09.965 --> 03:00:10.766

03:00:10.833 --> 03:00:12.601
RECOMMENDATIONS AND- AND THEN

03:00:12.668 --> 03:00:14.503
SEND THOSE TO THE LEGISLATURE.

03:00:14.570 --> 03:00:15.704
I KIND WOULD ARGUE THAT'S

03:00:15.771 --> 03:00:18.474
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. AND IT'S

03:00:18.541 --> 03:00:20.409
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MOVE

03:00:20.476 --> 03:00:22.545
THESE POLICIES BECAUSE EVERY

03:14:37.065 --> 03:14:39.200
BECAUSE OF JDM I DEVELOPED

03:14:39.267 --> 03:14:41.169

SCHOOL. ON TOP OF IT ALL I WAS

03:14:57.786 --> 03:14:59.354
EXPECTED TO MANAGE MY MEDICAL

03:14:59.421 --> 03:15:00.688

ADD MORE TO MY PLATE. MY

03:15:22.410 --> 03:15:24.145
BIGGEST CONCERN IS GETTING IN

CONSTRUCTION. AWESOME AND THEN

03:28:37.738 --> 03:28:38.606
SINCE I MEAN THERE ARE SOME

03:28:38.672 --> 03:28:39.740
CONCERNS THAT THIS IS CURRENTLY

03:28:39.807 --> 03:28:40.941
PLAGUE OF THERE'S ALREADY A AN

03:28:41.008 --> 03:28:43.077
H. ID OUT THERE- WHAT DO WE

03:28:43.143 --> 03:28:44.879
HAVE SAY LIKE. I MEAN AS FAR AS

03:28:44.945 --> 03:28:46.347
IS THERE ANY THINGS ONCE IT.

03:28:46.413 --> 03:28:48.015
PUT IN PLACE. THAT WE CAN

03:28:48.082 --> 03:28:49.917
PROTECT AGAINST OVERLAY AND

03:28:49.984 --> 03:28:51.252
LIKE CONFLICTING DATA LIKE IS

03:28:51.318 --> 03:28:52.186
EVERYTHING IN PLACE TO MAKE

03:28:52.253 --> 03:28:54.154
SURE THAT WE HAVE ONE. HIV

03:28:54.221 --> 03:28:55.356
THAT'S HANDLING ALL OF THIS IS

03:28:55.422 --> 03:28:56.557
THAT OF A- A DUPLICATE OF

03:28:56.624 --> 03:28:58.325
SYSTEM. WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE

03:28:58.392 --> 03:28:59.760
GOAL IS TO GET HAVE SOMETHING

03:28:59.827 --> 03:29:01.762
THAT ISN'T DUPLICATIVE- I WOULD

03:29:01.829 --> 03:29:03.597
COUNTER THAT THE OPPOSITION

03:29:03.664 --> 03:29:04.665
SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT

03:29:04.732 --> 03:29:06.634
WE GOT GOOD COVERAGE OUT THERE.

03:29:06.700 --> 03:29:08.168
THE BAY AREA RIGHT NOW HAS A

03:29:08.235 --> 03:29:09.503
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WHITE

03:29:09.570 --> 03:29:11.305
SPACE WHICH MEANS. IN MY WHICH

03:29:11.372 --> 03:29:12.773
MEANS. THAT THERE'S NO COVERAGE

03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:15.609
AT ALL THERE- AND THE RELIANCE

03:29:15.676 --> 03:29:17.244
ON FEDERAL NETWORKS DOESN'T

03:29:17.311 --> 03:29:19.380
NECESSARILY SUPPORT. WHAT GOES

03:29:19.446 --> 03:29:21.048
ON IN INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES.

LONG HERS HAD A GREAT EXAMPLE

03:29:24.318 --> 03:29:25.886

SYSTEM AS ALLOWS ALLOWS FOR

03:29:31.392 --> 03:29:33.394
THAT IF THAT WAS THE CASE. I

03:29:33.460 --> 03:29:34.628
WOULDN'T BE HERE WITH THIS BILL

03:29:34.695 --> 03:29:36.830

03:29:36.897 --> 03:29:38.565
WHOLE. MYRIAD OF DIFFERENT

03:29:38.632 --> 03:29:40.534
DIFFERENT PROVIDERS OUT THERE.

03:29:40.601 --> 03:29:41.669
IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO GET

IMPORTANCE OF AN OFFICE

03:29:55.115 --> 03:29:55.983
BUILDING I MEAN WE NEED THAT

AT WHAT ALL WENT INTO A HEALTH

03:30:36.557 --> 03:30:38.359
INFORMATION EXCHANGE. BUT IT

03:30:38.425 --> 03:30:40.694
DOES SEEM TO ME THAT A STATE

03:30:40.761 --> 03:30:43.097
LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD

03:30:43.163 --> 03:30:45.165
BE ABLE TO PUT. SOMETHING

03:30:45.232 --> 03:30:46.734
TOGETHER WHERE ALL OF OUR

03:30:46.800 --> 03:30:48.202
SYSTEMS ARE TALKING TO EACH

03:30:48.268 --> 03:30:50.204
OTHER IN AN EFFICIENT EFFICIENT

03:30:50.270 --> 03:30:52.172
