IN FACT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA ESTIMATES THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY JUST ELEVEN YEARS FROM OF ELEVEN YEARS AWAY THE POPULATION WILL GROW BY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE. THIS RAPID GROWTH RATE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO ACT TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION HAS ACCESS TO ACCESSIBLE COMMUNITIES. AND THE CARE AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S OLDER POPULATION IS INCREASING OUR STATE GENERAL PLAN FAILS TO PROMOTE THE DESIGN OF COMMUNITIES. THAT ALLOW THE RESIDENTS TO AGE IN PLACE. THAT IS WHY I AM VERY EXCITED TO AUTHORED AB ONE ONE ONE EIGHT WHICH WILL LAUNCH CALIFORNIA INTO THE FUTURE AS A MEMBER OF AARP'S AGE FRIENDLY NETWORK. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AT THE NEXT UPDATE OF THE STATE GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES TO INCLUDE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S. DOMAINS OF LIVE ABILITY. THESE DOMAINS INCLUDE EIGHT AREAS OF COMMUNITY LIFE THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO NOT ONLY SENIORS BUT TRULY PEOPLE OF ALL AGES THEY INCLUDE OUTDOOR SPACES IN BUILDINGS. TRANSPORTATION HOUSING SOCIAL PARTICIPATION RESPECT THE SOCIAL INCLUSION CIVIC PARTICIPATION AND EMPLOYMENT COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION COMMUNITY AND HEALTH SERVICES. MANY CITIES ALREADY SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF UTILIZING THE AGE FRIENDLY NETWORK AS A PATH FORWARD TO CITY PLANNING INCLUDING BERKELEY SAN FRANCISCO WEST SACRAMENTO -- HELZBERG HERALDS BREAK LOS ANGELES ROLES BILL SAN DIEGO IN WEST HOLLYWOOD. SO NO MY COUNTY JUST TO NAME A FEW JURISDICTIONS IN FACT CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY PREPARING FOR THE GROWING AGING POPULATION.

AB ELEVEN EIGHTEEN IS A MAJOR STEP IN MOVING CALIFORNIA. TOWARDS CREATING COMMUNITIES THE WE PREPARED FOR THIS DEMOGRAPHIC CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE CREATING A STATE THAT IS LIVABLE FOR ALL AGES. SPACE SPECIFICALLY AB ELEVEN EIGHTEEN RESONATES WITH THIRTY THREE CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS CONTAINING OVER THIRTEEN POINT THREE MILLION CITIZENS THAT ALREADY EMPLOY THE H. FINALLY FRAMEWORK TO STRENGTHEN THEIR PLANNING. IT HARMONIZES WITH THE OPERATIONAL CONCEPT IN THE JOURNAL PLAN GUIDES NOW IN BUILT ON PROGRAMS ALREADY WORKING WELL. AND WHEN ABLE CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THE NATIONAL A. R. P. NETWORK OF H. FRIENDLY STATES AND COMMUNITIES IN A STATE GOVERNMENT CODE TO ALLOW THE EIGHT AREAS OF LIVABILITY IN USE BY OVER SEVEN HUNDRED CITIES WORLDWIDE. TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE GENERAL PLANNING PROCESS. AS US PHILIP WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S GLOBAL NETWORK OF H. FRIENDLY CITIES AND COMMUNITIES A. R. P. PROVIDES A LARGE VARIETY OF SUPPORTING RESEARCH. AND PRACTICAL RESOURCES WHEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND ROLE IN THE H. FAMILY NETWORK THE ELECTED OFFICIALS COMMIT TO DEVELOPMENT. OF FIVE YEAR PROCESS TO CREATE COMMUNITIES ARE AGE FRIENDLY FOR ALL AGES AND ABILITIES. THEY DO THIS FIRST BY LISTENING TO THEIR CITIZENS THEN HOLLISTER LOOKING AT WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT AND THEN CREATING A THREE YEAR ACTION PLAN.

ALRIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB. EIGHT NINETY ONE WELCOME AND BEGIN WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR YOU [inaudible] OVER HERE [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND YOUR MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BE IN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT SOMEONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL. AB EIGHT NINETY ONE REQUIRE CITIES AND POPULATIONS GREATER THAN THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND AND EACH COUNTY TO ESTABLISH A STATE PARKING PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES A PARKING LOCATIONS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES. CITIES AND COUNTIES WILL WORK IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WHO WILL IDENTIFY SURPLUS STATE PROPERTY FOR THIS PURPOSE. THESE LOCAL PROGRAMS WILL HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE PROGRAM THAT FIT LOCAL NEEDS AS WELL AS AN APPLICATION PROCESS THAT MAY INCLUDE -- BACKGROUND CHECK FOR PARTICIPANTS. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE REQUIRING THE PROGRAM PROVIDED BATHROOM FACILITY AND ON SITE SECURITY FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. PROGRAMS CREATED UNDER THIS BILL WILL ALSO BE ENCOURAGED TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL NONPROFITS AS WELL AS CITIES AND COUNTY AGENCIES TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES. THAT LEAD TO LONG TERM HOUSING. I IN THIS IN THIS JANUARY'S BUDGET PROPOSAL GOVERNANCE AND DISCUSS IDENTIFYING SURPLUS STATE PROPERTY FOR HOUSING EMERGENCY SHELTER. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO END HOMELESSNESS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U. S. WERE WITHOUT HOUSING AND A QUARTER OF THOSE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO STAY OVERNIGHT WHILE THEY WORK TO TRANSITION TO A MORE PERMANENT HOUSING. A SIX EXISTING STATE PARKING PROGRAMS CREATED IN SANTA BARBARA AND LOS ANGELES AMONG OTHER AMONG OTHERS CAN SERVICE SUCCESSFUL MODELS FOR FUTURE PROGRAMS. VEHICULAR HOMELESSNESS IS ON THE RISE AND DESERVES TO BE RECOGNIZED AND ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA WITH ME TODAY IS PAUL MAS YEAH WITH THE SACRAMENTO HOMELESS ORGA ORGANIZING COMMITTEE AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. WELCOME HALL THANK YOU SO MUCH -- SO GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS PAULA Là MAZIE AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SACRAMENTO HOMES ORGANIZING COMMITTEE. AND I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT NINE ONE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SACRAMENTO WAS RANKED NINTH AMONG THE TOP FIFTY U. S. CITIES IN RENT GROWTH. THERE IS A HIGH CORRELATION IN LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS. FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOUSING THEIR VEHICLES ARE THEIR LAST RECOURSE THEIR LAST CHANCE TO AVOID HAVING TO SLEEP OUTDOORS AND PROTECTED. EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND OTHER DANGERS. IT IS A PLACE THEY CAN KEEP THEIR SURVIVAL GEAR IN THEIR CLOTHING DRY. SACRAMENTO'S ANTI CAMPING ORDINANCES MAKES IT AGAINST THE LAW. TO LIVE IN A VEHICLE AS IT IS ALSO AGAINST THE LAW TO LIVE OUTDOORS. SACRAMENTO FOUND 8% OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION WERE SLEEPING VEHICLES ON THE POINT IN TELLING COUNT. ONE NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ON THAT SAME NIGHT IT WAS FOUND THERE HAD BEEN 30% INCREASE IN OVERALL. HOMELESSNESS SINCE. 20001556% WERE FOUND SLEEPING ON SHELTERED WHICH WAS AN 85% INCREASE FROM. ARE NOT AVAILABLE YET -- BUT WE CAN ASSUME THE NUMBERS HAVE NOT DECREASED. ESPECIALLY -- UNDERCOUNTED WOULD BE THOSE LIVING IN. THEIR VEHICLE SINCE IT'S HARD TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE IS SLEEPING IN A VEHICLE IN THOSE -- LIVING VEHICLES CAN BE SO WIDELY DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. FOR THOSE LIVING IN VEHICLES SINCE THEY ARE SO WIDELY DISPERSED. IT CAN MAKE IT HARDER TO BRING SERVICES AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM WITH SAY PARKING PROGRAM SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER FORM RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM AND TO OFFER SERVICES -- TOO MANY IN ONE LOCATION -- WE MUST MEET THESE CHALLENGES OF HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH CREATIVE WAYS. TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES LESS MISERABLE. ELIMINATING UNNECESSARY OBSTACLES IN THEIR LIVES AND PROVIDE A PLACE THAT IS BOTH SAFE AND SANITARY WAS SERVICES -- I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AB EIGHT NINE ONE BECAUSE IT WILL ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE OTHER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE -- ENTERTAIN A MOTION AND SO YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER UP SO I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS -- ABOUT THIS BILL I REALLY RESPECT YOU FOR BRINGING AT AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. HERE AND AND I'M GONNA VOTE FOR IT -- I'M -- I MADE SOME SIMILAR COMMENTS YESTERDAY ON A BILL THAT HAD TO DO WITH -- PROVIDING SAFE -- PARKING OR REQUIRING CUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PROVIDE SAFE PARKING AREAS. ON ON CAMPUSES -- FIRST A COUPLE OF A COMMENTS ABOUT THE BILL GOING FORWARD I'M AYE I THINK -- THE LANGUAGES RIGHT NOW ON THE CONNECTING THE SERVICES IS ENCOURAGING -- CONNECTION TO SERVICES IT'S AND MY VIEW ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL -- THAT ANY -- FACILITY THAT -- WORKS ON HOMELESS ISSUES NEEDS TO ABSOLUTELY OF HELP CONNECT TO A TO SERVICES AND THERE'S A GOOD WAY OF DOING THAT AND AND NOT SO GOOD WAY OF DOING THAT SO I THINK IT NEEDS. TO LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE WORKED AND INTO THE BILL -- THE THE OTHER -- LANGUAGE THAT I HEARD WAS -- MERCHANTS TO SHELTER -- AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT CALLS THIS AN EMERGENCY SHELTER BUT THIS IS DECIDEDLY NOT. OF AN EMERGENCY SHELTER WHICH LEADS ME TO MY LAST AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW FOR ME OF HAVING WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY DECADES NOW -- ACTED IF I BECOME DESPONDENT WHEN I THINK THAT WE ARE -- USING PARKING LOTS TO ALLOW -- PEOPLE SAFE PLACE -- TO BE IN THEIR CARS OF NONE OF US SHOULD THANK THAT A CAR IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN SUB STANDARD HOUSING. AND WHEN WE OF MIKE MY CONCERN ABOUT. WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH WITH THESE TWO BILLS IS THAT WERE BEGINNING WHEN I BEGINNING WITH ACTUALLY DONE THIS AND OTHER CONTEXTS? TO NORMALIZE -- THE THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD -- ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE IN SUBSTANDARD HOUSING -- AND I THINK IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ON ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW. I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER TO WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE -- VOTING ON A BILL LIKE THIS BUT IT JUST -- CAUSES ME TO ACHE IN MY HEART THAT WERE ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU IN ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE OKAY SING NONE DO WE HAVE A MOTION ALREADY WE'LL BUILD. HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IT WOULD -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLAMES COMMENTS YES OBVIOUSLY SERVICES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THE FACT THAT THAT WE EVEN HAVE TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IS THE NEEDS -- IT SHOULD BE BENEATH US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER IT'S NOT. AND SO YES SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT AND NO IT IS NOT AT MY OUR GOAL TO NORMALIZE. OF LIVING IN YOUR CAR. HOWEVER -- AS YOU SAID RIGHT NOW WITH THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE AND FORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE CITIZENS THE BEST WE CAN WITH WHAT WE HAVE ALLOCATED AND I THINK THIS IS. ONE STEP CLOSER TO FINDING A WAY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO FIND THEM THE SERVICES TO BRING THEM TO HOUSING -- AND TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION AND I THINK RIGHT NOW OUR RESPONSIBILITY WITH WHERE WE ARE NOW IS TO TO TO DO THAT -- WITH THAT -- I THINK YOU THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR COMMENTS WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT YOU PUT BEFORE US WE APPRECIATE THEM. THEY ARE GOOD GUIDANCE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SO AB. EIGHT EIGHT NINETY ONE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THROUGH THIS MEASURE I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH ONE I APPRECIATE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOMS COMMENTS AS WELL AS YOURS AND YOUR AND YOUR WITNESS HERE -- WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING RIGHT AND ISN'T THIS IS KIND OF SAD THAT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE BUT THE FACT OF MATTER IS WE WANT PEOPLE SAY. THAT'S WHAT OUR ROLE IS WE GET ELECTED IS TO MAKE SURE THE SAFETY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS NO MATTER WHAT IT IS. SO -- WE DO HAVE SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE TIMING -- IT REFLECTED THE ANALYSIS WILL BE ADOPTED AT THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING ABOUT TODAY. SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I LACKEY BLOOM. BLOOM I'D BURNER **** BATH. BOERNER HORVATH I RAMOS. FROM ASIDE THREE OF US THREE OF US I ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVAS I VOEPEL VOEPEL NOW. RESULT SIX ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY.

SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM SURE MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THEM AND I'M SURE ON OUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED AND AGREED -- TO IMPRINT AB NINE THIRTY ONE MORE REQUIRE THE COMPOSITION OF EACH APPOINTED STATE LOCAL. BOARDING COMMISSION WITH AT LEAST FIVE APPOINTED MEMBERS TO HAVE BY 202550% WOMEN. AT LEAST 50% WOMEN. YOU CAN SPEAKING IF YOU'D LIKE. OKAY I WOULD LIKE TO READ SOME THINGS IN THE RECORD I WOULD LIKE YOU TO READ IT THANK YOU -- AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AB NINE THIRTY ONE WILL NOT APPLY TO STATE BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS WILL MAKE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO SECTION THREE OF THE BILL AS FOLLOWS. REMOVE COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS LIMóN APPLICATION TO CITIES WITH A POPULATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR GREATER. CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF LOCAL BORDER COMMISSION TO APPLY TO ADVISORY BODIES ONLY THAT MEANS APPOINTED BOARDS OF A ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL BE EXCLUDED -- AND CHANGED EFFECTIVE DATE TO TWENTY THIRTY THESE AMENDMENTS NEAR THE BILL SIGNIFICANTLY BUT THEY STILL GET AT THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE WERE FIGHTING FOR WHICH IS EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION OF MEN AND WOMEN ON LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THE SERVICE A PIPELINE FOR HIGHER OFFICE. WOMEN TO THIS DAY REMAIN VASTLY UNDERREPRESENTED ON APPOINTED BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT. FOR EXAMPLE FOR ME WHEN I GOT ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION ONE OF THE REASONS I APPLIED IT WAS IS ALL MALE BULLARD WHO WERE DESIST DECIDING ALL OF OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT WASN'T OKAY -- I WAS OF FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER WOMAN AND NOW THERE'S AN ALL MALE BOARD AGAIN THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WOMAN INVITED TO THE TABLE AND AND THEY ARE NO THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE WELCOME AND INVITED TO HELP BE PART OF THE DECISION MAKING. OF OUR CITIES. ANOTHER COLLEAGUE ALSO SHARED WITH ME RECENTLY THAT WHEN SHE WAS CONSIDERING RUNNING FOR LOCAL OFFICE SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER GET ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE PIPELINE TO ELECTED OFFICE. THESE ARE THE REAL STORIES OF WOMEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN OUR STATE AND IT'S TIME WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND IT'S AN ISSUE A STATEWIDE CONCERN THE CALIFORNIA HAS EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION AND WE HAVE NARROWLY TAILORED THIS BILL TO ADDRESS THE STORK IN EQUITIES AND DISCRIMINATION AND DIFFERENCE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WOMEN'S FACE. WITHOUT FAIR REPRESENTATION LAW WOMEN WHO ARE 52% OF THE CALIFORNIA STRUGGLE TO SEE A CHIEF FAIR AND EQUAL REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE VARIOUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT GOVERN OUR DAILY LIVES. DEPENDING ON THE BORDER COMMISSION OF WHICH THEY SERVE APPOINTEES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ISSUES PERTAINING TO PERMITTING PLANNING TRAFFIC PUBLIC SAFETY PARKS AND RECREATION. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND STANDARDS. THESE ARE THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF OUR DAILY LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS AND WOMEN'S VOICES NEED TO BE EQUITABLY HEARD. AB NINE THIRTY ONE SIX TO REMEDY HISTORICAL CHEN GENDER DISPARITIES IN APPOINTMENTS TO PUBLIC BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS BY REQUIRING THAT LEAST HAVE 50% WOMEN BY. TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S WHY THIS BILL JOY'S THE SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN AND ITS MANY LOCAL CHAPTERS. THE STATE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES AMONG OTHER GROUPS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND I HAVE HERE WITH ME TODAY SO FOR A IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OLGA MAC ADVOCATE AUTHOR PROFESSOR FOUNDER OF WOMEN SIT ON BOARDS. MOVEMENT LEN TRITON OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA SO I'LL GIVE IT OVER TO YOU FOR A FEW COMMON THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS OLGA MAC I'M THE FOUNDER OF WOMEN SERVE ON BOARDS WE HAVE CONVINCED -- OVER FIFTEEN FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES TO DISCOVER THEIR FIRST WOMAN -- I ALSO TEACH LEADERSHIP -- TO MEET MANY EXECUTIVES AND I ALSO TEACH LEADERSHIP AND BERKELEY LAW -- I HAVE WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT BORIS SERVICE AND I WAS APPOINTED ON THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION BY GOVERNOR BROWN -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATE IN SUPPORT OF THIS -- BILL -- IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT WOMEN ARE REFERENCE UNDER REPRESENTED IN MANY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS INCLUDING GOVERNMENT POSITIONS IN THE STATE AND THE UNITED STATES -- AND WHILE THE PRIMARY REASON TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OR ANY COMMISSION IS TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND TO MAKE GOOD POLICIES UP WHAT WE OFTEN DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE BENEFITS THIS SERVICE PROVIDES TO WOMEN. I'LL LET ME HIGHLIGHT THE THREE THAT I FOUND PERSONALLY VERY IMPORTANT IN MY CAREER. AND MY SERVICE -- ONE IT PROVIDES VISIBILITY -- MOST OF SERVICES IS PUBLIC IT IS RECORDED IT IS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO ATTEND. THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE SKILLS AND VIEWS AND CREDIBILITY FOR WOMEN CLOSER. A NUMBER TWO IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN MOST LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND SUBSTANTIVE SKILLS SO WHEN YOU SEE IT AT A GOVERNING BODY YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DAY TO DAY JOB MAY OR MAY NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO MANAGE BUDGETS WHICH A CRITICAL FOR WOMEN TO ADVANCE. AND MANY BODIES LIKE THIS FOR EXAMPLE DEAL WAS CUTTING EDGE ISSUES AGAIN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AN OPPORTUNITY IN YOUR DAILY JOB. NUMBER -- THREE WE HOLD OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO VERY HIGH ETHICS AND STANDARDS. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY LEADER CAN BENEFIT FROM -- SERVING ON THE GOVERNMENT BODY IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE YOURSELF AS AN ETHICAL AND LEADER OF A GREAT INTEGRITY -- THERE NUMEROUS STUDIES HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE US TO REACH PARITY IN VARIOUS LEADERSHIP. YES IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES. ARE FOR EXAMPLE ON CORPORATE BOARDS IT WILL TAKE FORTY TO ONE HUNDRED YEARS SO LET ME PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE IN FORTY YEARS I WILL BE ABOUT.

IN THE HISTORIC TREND TO TOWARD GENDER PARITY THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IS TO ACHIEVE IT IN OUR LIFETIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IS FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS PLAN TRENTON REPRESENTING CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. WE WENT TO COMMAND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURNER HARD FOR ITS FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO ATTENTION. I IT'S FITTING THAT THIS BILL FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS OF EQUAL PAY DAY. WITHOUT EQUAL REPRESENTATION WE CANNOT HAVE A QUALITY. AB NINE THIRTY ONE TAKES THE FIGHT TO THE GRASS ROOTS BY REQUIRING EQUAL REPRESENTATION ON LOCAL COMMISSIONS AND REQUIRES REPORTING. TO IDENTIFY CONTINUE IN AN EQUITIES AND BOARD APPOINTMENTS. A COUPLE OF STATISTICS ON THE DIFFERENCE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP MAKE. RESEARCH ON LOCAL COUNCILS IN INDIA DISCOVERED THAT THE NUMBER OF DRINKING WATER PROJECTS IN AREAS WITH WOMEN LEAD COUNSELS WITH 62% HIGHER THAN THOSE WITH MEN LED COUNCILS. IN NORWAY. A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN ON COUNCILS. AND COMMISSIONS -- AND INCREASED CHILD CARE COVERAGE. AND WE KNOW THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS PROVIDE ADVANTAGES SUCH AS PROVIDING AN IN DEPTH EXAMINATION OF ISSUES OR A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL WITH LECTER OFFICIALS. AND THE COMMUNITY AND BRING IN A BROAD RANGE OF IDEAS AND EXPERTISE EXPERTISE TO PUBLIC DECISION MAKING. AND FINALLY ASSISTING IN THE RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS AND PROVIDING TRAINING FOR NEW LEADERS. WHAT BETTER PLACE FOR A WOMAN'S VOICE TO BE HEARD? FOR THESE REASONS CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IS PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BELL AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS TING HUTCHINGS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- THAT WE DO NOT FORMALLY WEIGH IN ON THE MEASURE -- PRIOR TO THE COMMITTEE AND ALICE SAYS IN FACT ARE -- YOU'RE HAVING A REVIEW BUYER ARE. LEAKS INTERNAL DIVERSITY CAUCUS OR WHEN IT'S CAUCUS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MEASURE TO SEE HOW WE CAN FIND WAYS TO MAKE IT IMPROVED BUT WERE GIVEN -- I WAS GIVEN ABOUT A IT'S A TWO HOUR NOTICE -- FROM A THIRD PARTY THAT THE BILL WAS BEING AMENDED TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET CITIES -- WHICH IS WHERE WHICH IS WHY I HAD TO COME IN AND JUMP IN AND AND AND SHARE SOME CONCERNS WE HAVE THE MEASURE I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MEASURE I YOU KNOW BEST I CAN TELL. I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE -- PUT IN THE MEASURE -- BUT HEARING THE BREAKDOWN OF THE MEASURE IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT THE ONLY. OUT FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT WAS ACTUALLY ADDRESSED INDIA MADMAN'S WAS SIMPLY THE DEFINITION OF A LOCAL BOARD AND COMMISSION AND SO NOW E ARE. CREATING A A BIFURCATED SYSTEM -- FOR FOR CITIES -- IN GIVEN THAT IT'S A MATTER STATEWIDE CONCERN IT APPLIES TO CHARTER CITIES AS WELL -- BUT COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN THE LIKE -- CONTINUE TO GO ON BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH DESPITE THE FACT THAT I HAVE NOT YET SEEN ANY SORT OF CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC DATA THAT IS THAT THAT. LEADS. ANYONE TO BELIEVE IN ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A MORE OF AN ISSUE WITH CITIES VERSUS OTHER FORMS OF THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- WITH THAT WE WE KNOW WE WOULD ASK THAT WE WOULD YOU KNOW I TOTALLY GET UNDERSTAND I THINK OUR MEMBERS GET UNDERSTAND WHERE -- THE MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO GO IN AND HAS HAS CERTAINLY ARE -- ARTICULATED AYE AYE CHALLENGE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- I DO SEE IT THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD WORK ON COLLABORATIVELY SHOULD WE BE -- INCLUDE ON THE FRONT END TO WORK ON BIG MAYBE BEST PRACTICES OUR GUIDANCE IS AND HOW WE CAN APPOINT -- AND NOT JUST -- WOMEN AND OTHER OTHER FORMS OTHER. UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS AS AS WAS ARTICULATED IN THE ANALYSIS -- THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT WE WE FEEL THAT WOULD WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING AND UNDER THIS MEASURE -- I UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THE BILL WILL LIKELY MOVE TODAY BUT WOULD WOULD ASK THAT -- PERHAPS THIS COMMITTEE TAKE PAUSE AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS NOW CREATES A BIFURCATED SYSTEM BY WHERE CITIES ARE BEING -- FORCED TO COMPLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND MANDATES -- WHEREAS OTHER. AGENCIES ARE NOT -- WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY A OPPOSED TO POST MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE IS OR ARE THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OTHER A QUESTIONS OF THE CODE -- YES THIS BILL SORRY THIS VERY -- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEAL GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION -- WITH WITH A MEMBERS HAS PROPOSED WE HAVE NO CONCERNS LEFT WITH THE BILL.

I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY THANK YOU. FOR OUR MEETING YESTERDAY YOU CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND WE DISCUSSED THIS. A LITTLE BIT AND I WHOLE HEARTEDLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. BUT I HAVE A COMMENT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION I LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER. A 50% OF A FIVE MEMBER BOARD IS TWO AND A HALF WOMEN. AND YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO AND A HALF PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY. THAT BEING SAID ON THE SAME FIVE MEMBER BOARD. MEMBER WOULD NOW MAKE UP. THREE OF THE TOTAL NUMBERS WHICH MANDATES MAJORITY AND NOT EQUAL REPRESENTATION. WE CAN AGREE THAT DIVERSITY ACTUALLY BRINGS ABOUT DIFFERENT IDEAS. BUT I BELIEVE THE APPLICATION OF THE PERSON 50% ROLE AS PROBLEMATIC. I WOULD PROPOSE THAT WHEN THE BOARD IS COMPRISED OF FIVE MEMBERS. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD MANDATE AT LEAST TO BE WOMEN. SIMILARLY WHEN THE BOARD HAS. SEVEN THREE SHOULD BE WOMEN WITH NINE MEMBERS. AND FOR SHOULD BE WOMEN AND SO ON THIS DOESN'T RESTRICT OTHER WOMEN FROM BEING APPOINTED TO THE BOARD. IT SIMPLY SHOWS THAT A GROUP TYPICALLY NOT REPRESENTED. HAS A WELCOME SEAT AT THE TABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE TWO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE DO HAVE MOTION SECOND OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS -- I KNOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR MANY OF US WOMEN MAKE UP A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
