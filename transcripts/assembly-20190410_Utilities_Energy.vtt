HOURS AND THEN IT'S CUT IN HALF

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:20.653
AGAIN OF FOUR HOURS.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.555
SO THE WAY THAT THE S. CHIP IS

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.956
CURRENTLY INCENTIVES ARE

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.591
CURRENTLY STRUCTURED.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:28.561
IS NOT EXACTLY AN ALIGNMENT AND

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:29.161
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WHERE

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.763
DIRECTION THE P. YOU SEE WOULD

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.064
BE REALLY HELPFUL.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.766
THE LAST PART IS IS THAT THERE

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:34.734

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.969

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.288

RECOGNIZED IN THE HANDBOOK

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:01.494
THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO BE

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.661

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:03.963

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:44.203
RENEWABLES.

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:46.572
AND WE HAVE AT THE SAME TIME

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:47.906
HAVE HAD GAS UTILITIES WHICH

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.174
HAVE.

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.843
INVESTED HEAVILY IN A GAS

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:53.212
DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:54.680
NOW MOST OF OUR HOUSES AND

BUSINESSES ARE CONNECTED AND

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.449
TIED INTO THAT SYSTEM.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:59.151
SO AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA WHICH

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:01.019
IS THE NATION'S SECOND LARGEST

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:03.655

WHICH IS IMPORTED -- HAS MANY

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:06.725
PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY WHICH ARE

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:09.695
DIRECTLY TIED TO GAS PRICES TO

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:11.263
NATURAL GAS PRICES IS IN WITHIN

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.031
THIS CONTEXT WE FIND OURSELVES

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:15.134
TODAY. FOR ABOUT THE LAST NINE

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:21.206
PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS.

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:22.374
AND THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.743
ADVANCEMENTS IN UNCONVENTIONAL

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.645

SYSTEM WHICH IS MADE AVAILABLE

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:31.850
FOR FOLKS SO LAST YEAR WHEN

INCREASES.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.757
MANY WERE LEFT UNPREPARED

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.392
RESULTING IN ALMOST A BILLION

DOLLARS OF EXTRA EXPENDITURES

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.830

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:38.283
DRINKING THE INCLUSION OF PO USE.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.551
AND LIMITING THE POTENTIAL SCOPE

00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:40.452
OF PROCUREMENT.

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:41.586
BUT WE WOULD APPRECIATE A

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:44.222
COMMITMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:44.756
THAT THIS LANGUAGE CAN BE

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:45.791
CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSED AND

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:46.925
REVISE ONCE THE AUTHOR -- IS

00:23:46.992 --> 00:23:49.761
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE INTHOSE

00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:52.430
DISCUSSIONS.

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:53.465
I DON'T KNOW IS THAT IT OKAY YES

00:23:53.532 --> 00:23:54.099
SIR AND THAT'S A YES.

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:56.134
THAT'S A YES WITH THE HOPE THAT

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:57.002
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO HIM

00:23:57.068 --> 00:24:00.038
I THINK -- THE BILL WILL CREATE

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:01.907
THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN ELECTRICITY

00:24:01.973 --> 00:24:02.908
AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THE FACT

00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:04.643
THAT NO ONE DISAGREES WITH THE

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:06.378
NATURE OF ENERGY PROCUREMENT IN

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:08.013
CALIFORNIA HAS FUNDAMENTALLY

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:08.847
CHANGED.

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:10.382
CURRENTLY IF THERE IS AN ISSUE

00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:11.883
WITH OUR GREAT FOR ANY REASON

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.218
THE STATE IS LEFT WITH LITTLE

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.787
RESOURCE RECOURSE OUR OPTIONS TO

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:17.422
ALLOW US TO ACT QUICKLY.

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:18.290
THIS NEW AUTHORITY WILL NOT

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:19.758
INTERFERE AT ALL WITH THE

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:20.859
PROCUREMENT AS IT CURRENTLY

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:22.360
HAPPENS BY THOSE SERVING ENEMIES

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.129
AND IS NARROWLY DEFINED TO

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:26.064
ADDRESS SPECIFIC SITUATIONS.

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.699
AS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE.

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:29.067
AB FIFTY SIX DESIGNS THIS NEW

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:30.335
AUTHORITY TO OPERATE LIKE A

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:32.170
UTILITY THAT ONLY ACTS WHEN THE

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:33.738
WHEN DIRECTED TO BY THE STATE

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:35.774
AND IS SUBJECT TO ST STRICT

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.042
STATE OVERSIGHT.

00:24:37.108 --> 00:24:38.143
IN THE EVENT THAT THE AUTHORITY

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.945
DOES PURCHASE POWER ANY

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:41.513
ASSOCIATED BENEFITS AND COSTS

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.548
LEFT OVER AFTER THAT POWERS SOLD

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:45.050
WILL BE PASSED ON TO REPAIRS.

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:45.617
BUT IS THE GOAL THAT THE

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:46.918
BENEFITS IN THOSE SITUATIONS

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:50.021
WOULD FAR OUTWEIGH ANY COSTS.

00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:50.589
THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE FOR

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.224
CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF THE

COMES AT A VERY CRITICAL TIME --

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:11.309
AND WOOD.

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:13.745
DEVELOP A NEW BACKSTOP

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:15.914
PROCUREMENT MECHANISM. FOR A

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:17.215
LIKE TRICITY IN RELIABILITY

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:19.217
PRODUCTS UNDER SPECIFIC

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:21.119

STATE'S RELIABILITY CLEAN ENERGY

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.257
CLIMATE RESOURCE PLANNING GOALS.

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:27.759
I'M WE ARE AS A STATE AT YET

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.895
ANOTHER CROSSROADS -- WE HAVE A

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:31.062
RISE IN COMMUNITY CHOICE

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:33.064
AGGREGATION INCREASES IN DIRECT

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:33.999

WHOM IS IN BANKRUPTCY -- AND BIG

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:41.206
QUESTIONS CIRCLING ABOUT WHAT

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:43.508
THE ROLE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:44.309
UTILITIES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.010
FUTURE.

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:46.745
IN THE FACE OF THAT THE STATE

00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:48.947
HAS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:51.316
TO COORDINATED RESOURCES AND

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:52.884
RELIABILITY PLANNING.

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:55.086
THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE EVEN

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.588
GREATER VALUE NOW THAN EVER

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:57.555
BEFORE.

00:25:57.622 --> 00:25:59.057
THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN STATE

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:00.725
OVERSIGHT OVER THE ACHIEVEMENT

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:01.760
OF THESE GOALS.

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:03.361
COULD SET THE STAGE FOR THE NEXT

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:04.963
ENERGY CRISIS OUR GOALS TO AVOID

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.099
THAT TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.200
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:10.502
LANDING THAT IS NOT BEING

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:12.070
REALIZED THROUGH ACTUAL

00:26:12.137 --> 00:26:13.805
PROCUREMENTS THAT ARE BEING SEEN

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:14.339
IN THE MARKET BY RETAIL

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.574
PROVIDERS -- CAN BE DONE FOR A

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.343
BACKSTOP MECHANISM AN EXISTING

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.045
STATE LAW HAS THOSE BACKSTOP

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:22.213
MECHANISMS TODAY TO THE EXTENT

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.481
THAT RELIABILITY NEEDS ARE NOT

00:26:23.548 --> 00:26:24.649
BEING MET THE INVESTOR OWNED

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:25.917
UTILITIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY

00:26:25.984 --> 00:26:27.519
UNDER EXISTING LAW TO GO OUT.

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:30.322
AND PROCURE BRAND NEW RESOURCES

00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:31.756
IN CHARGE ALL CUSTOMERS FOR IT.

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.558
IF THE I USED DON'T DO IT.

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:35.193
THE CALIFORNIA I SO HAS THE

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.895
ABILITY TO STEP IN AND EXECUTE

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:38.930
CONTRACTS FOR RELIABILITY

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:39.798
RESOURCES AND TO CHARGE

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:40.432
EVERYBODY.

00:26:40.498 --> 00:26:41.800
AND ALL OF THOSE COMMITMENTS ARE

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:44.669
SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:45.837
ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION.

00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:47.105
IF WE DO NOTHING THOSE BACKSTOPS

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.373
WILL REMAIN IN PLACE.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.542
BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO DESIGN A

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:52.344
NEW BACKSTOP MECHANISM. TO THE

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.878
ALTERNATIVES THAT WE HAVE ARE TO

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:55.347
INCREASE THE ROLE OF THE

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:57.148
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES.

00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:59.684
AND THE CALIFORNIA I SO. TO GO

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:01.353
DEEPER ON THE MANAGEMENT OF

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:03.121
PROCUREMENT BY THE LOAD SERVING

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:04.923
ENTITIES LIKE CCA'S AND DIRECT

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.360
ACCESS PROVIDERS. FOR DEVELOP AN

00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:09.928
INDEPENDENT MECHANISM THAT CAN

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:10.996
BE AVAILABLE TO STATE

00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:13.631
POLICYMAKERS TO USE AS NEEDED.

00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:15.000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:15.600
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL WILL

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:16.768
NOT DO.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:18.670
THIS BILL WOULD NOT TRANSFER ALL

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:19.070
OF THE PROCUREMENT

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:20.038
RESPONSIBILITIES TO CENTRAL

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:21.873
BUYER.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.341
ON THE ENTITY WOULD SERVE AS A

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:25.410
BACKSTOP BUYER FOR RESOURCES NOT

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:26.411
PROCURED BY OTHER LOAD SERVING

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.246
ENTITIES BUT DEEMED NECESSARY TO

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:29.547
MEET GRADE RELIABILITY AND THE

00:27:29.614 --> 00:27:31.483
SATISFIED DEFICITS IDENTIFIED.

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:32.851
IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.119
PLANNING PROCESS.

00:27:34.185 --> 00:27:36.521
IT WOULD NOT CREATE A NEW AGENCY

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:38.356
THAT IS VESTED WITH POLICY

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.091
MAKING AUTHORITY -- OR DECISION

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:41.993
MAKING AUTHORITY.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.029
THIS ENTITY WOULD BE A TOOL THAT

00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:45.196
SIMPLY COULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE

00:27:45.263 --> 00:27:46.464
STATE POLICY OBJECTIVES NO

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.400
POLICY WOULD BE MADE IT WOULD BE

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:50.168
REQUIRED TO HAVE ALL OF ITS

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:51.736
PROCUREMENT AUTHORIZED IN

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.405
ADVANCE AND APPROVED AFTER THE

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:54.339
FACT.

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:55.040
BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:56.441
COMMISSION THAT'S EXACTLY THE

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.376
WAY UTILITIES WORK NOW ADVANCED

00:27:58.443 --> 00:27:59.811
DIRECTION FROM THE REGULATORS

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:01.446
AFTER THE FACT REVIEW AND

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:02.647
APPROVAL TO MAKE SURE ANY

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:04.215
COMMITMENTS ARE REASONABLE AND

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:05.383
TO APPROVE THE COLLECTION OF

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.751
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:07.752
COMMITMENTS.

00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:09.721
I'M THIS APPROACH LEARN FROM THE

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.256
MISTAKES THAT WE MADE DURING THE

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:14.125
ENERGY CRISIS BACK IN TWO

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:14.759
THOUSAND WHEN THE STATE WAS IN

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:15.894
CRISIS.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.128
WE DEPUTIZED THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.496
WATER RESOURCES TO GO OUT AND

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:20.598
SURVEY THE BACKSTOP ROLE IN THE

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:21.766
MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY.

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:22.901
WELL THEY BOUGHT A LOT OF POWER

00:28:22.967 --> 00:28:24.169
BUT THERE WAS NO REVIEW AND

00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:25.570
APPROVAL OF WHAT THEY DID.

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.572
THAT WAS A MISTAKE WE CAN'T

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.441
AFFORD TO MAKE THAT TWICE.

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:31.843
THIS BILL COME IS A OFFERED A

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.478
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.013
WHERE THE BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.283
WOULD BE OVERSEEN BY THE PUBLIC

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:39.150
UTILITIES COMMISSION.

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:39.717
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:41.186
PROCUREMENT IS NOT CONSISTENT

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:42.587
WITH THE NEEDS OF THE STATE.

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.522
IT WOULD NOT BE APPROVED.

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:45.790
THE OTHER THING THAT THIS BILL

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.592
DOES NOT DO IS IT DOES NOT HARM

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:50.095
RETAIL COMPETITION. FOR THE

00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:51.096
EMERGENCE OF COMMUNITY CHOICE

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:52.797
AGGREGATION.

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:54.065
THE BILL CLEARLY STATES THAT

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:55.600
CCA'S AND DIRECT ACCESS

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:57.969
PROVIDERS REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:01.072
PROCURING TO MEET 1100% OF THEIR

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:02.640
CUSTOMERS NEEDS.

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:03.808
IT'S ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.276
RESPECT THE AUTONOMY OF LOAD

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:06.611
SERVING ENTITIES AND TO

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:08.246
FACILITATE INCREASED RETAIL

00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:09.547
COMPETITION AND A HIGHER

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:10.715
PENETRATION OF COMMUNITY CHOICE

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:12.250
AGGREGATION.

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:13.818
ON THE PROCUREMENT THAT'S DONE

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:15.453
ON A BACKSTOPS BASIS WOULD

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.188
REDUCE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.923
FOR ALL OF THESE ENTITIES.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.091
SO EVERYONE WOULD GET CREDIT FOR

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.893
THE PROCUREMENT THAT'S DONE.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.994
BUT THE POWER WOULDN'T BE

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:24.963
ALLOCATED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:26.397
SPECIFICALLY LEAVING THOSE

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:28.566
PORTFOLIOS OPENED TO BE FILLED

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:31.035
BY THE LOCAL -- BUYERS TO MEET

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.004
OUR CUSTOMERS NEEDS.

00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:34.639
THE BILL ALSO DOES NOT ESTABLISH

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:36.608
ANY NEW PROCUREMENT MANDATES

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:38.309
DOES NOT AUTHORIZE PROCUREMENT

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:39.978
BEYOND WHAT IS AUTHORIZED IN

00:29:40.044 --> 00:29:41.546
EXISTING LAW.

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.214
IT LEADS ALL EXISTING PROGRAMS

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.682
AND REQUIREMENTS COMPLETELY

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:47.285
UNCHANGED.

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:47.886
THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:48.553
UNDERSTAND.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.688
THE BILL ITSELF.

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:52.724
IDENTIFIES PROCUREMENT. TO MEET

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.359
RESOURCE ADEQUACY NEEDS THAT ARE

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:55.660
ON MATT AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:56.461
THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:57.428
COMMISSION HAS ALREADY

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.364
IDENTIFIED AS THE TOPIC TO BE

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.899
DEALT WITH BY A CENTRAL BUYER IN

00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:02.400
A RECENT DECISION.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.635
IT ALSO LOOKS AT INTEGRATED

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.103
RESOURCE PLANNING IMMIGRANT

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.671
RESOURCES PLANNING DEFICITS THE

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:07.672
P. YOU SEE IN A PROPOSED

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:09.274
DECISION THAT IS DUE TO BE VOTED

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.110
OUT NEXT WEEK -- WOULD ESTABLISH

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:14.245
A PROCUREMENT TRACK IN WHICH IT

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:15.780
WILL BE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:17.248
WHETHER ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:18.183
NEEDS TO BE DONE BY CENTRAL

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:20.318
BUYER AND UNDER EXISTING LAW

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:21.786
THAT CENTRAL BUYER.

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:23.721
IS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY.

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:25.857
WE ALSO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:26.958
UNDER THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.760
STANDARD PROGRAM.

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:32.130
STARTING IN. 202165% OF ALL

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:34.065
COMPLIANCE MUST BE SOURCE FROM

00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:35.366
LONG TERM CONTRACTS.

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:36.734
WELL THE RBS PROGRAM HAS A

00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:38.069
PROVISION ALREADY.

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:40.138
THAT ALLOWS THE PC TO AUTHORIZE

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:42.140
A PROCUREMENT ENTITY.

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:43.741
ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS TO DO

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:45.109
PROCUREMENT ON BEHALF OF SMALL

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.411
OF SERVING ENTITIES.

00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:48.580
THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE MEETING

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.114
REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THIS.

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.749
ONE THAT PROVISION IS NEVER BEEN

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.318
OPERATIONALIZED OR IMPLEMENTED.

00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:56.087
THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A TOOL

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:57.855
FOR ALLOWING THAT PROVISION TO

00:30:57.922 --> 00:31:00.091
BE TURNED INTO AN ACTUAL VIABLE

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:01.993
OPTION FOR LOW SERVING ENTITIES

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.662
THAT NEED ASSISTANCE.

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:05.763
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.532
COMPLEX TOPIC.

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.267
AND THIS IS A BIG PICTURE

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.335
CONCEPT.

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:11.236
WE UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE

00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:13.104
AMENDMENTS CHANGE THE SCOPE OF

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:15.173
THE PROPOSAL -- BUT WE THINK

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.141
IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AS WE

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:19.143
MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR. TO HAVE

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.812
A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS ON THE

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:22.280
TABLE FOR DISCUSSION.

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:23.781
BECAUSE THERE IS WIDE CONSENSUS

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:25.016
THAT THERE IS NEED FOR SOME KIND

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.451
OF A NEW BACKSTOPS TOOL IN THE

00:31:26.517 --> 00:31:29.287
STATE.

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:29.787
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE.

00:31:29.854 --> 00:31:30.455
ONE WE'RE GONNA END UP HAVING TO

00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:32.290
CREATE ONE IN A HURRY UNDER

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:34.125
DURESS AND OUR HOPE IS TO BE

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:35.260
AHEAD OF THE CURVE IN THIS

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:35.860
RESPECT.

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:04.422
WE ARE MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:05.456
SAY THAT WE'VE HAD NO

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:06.724

THERE ARE ANY SHOWSTOPPER ISSUES

WHETHER THE ENTITY IS INTERESTED

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.239

LOT OF ADDITIONAL WORK NEEDS TO

BE DONE TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:30.682
ARE OTHER STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:32.183
ARE PROBLEMATIC ASSOCIATED WITH

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:32.917
THIS.

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:33.751
THE ANSWER IS YES.

SO -- JOB CIPHERS WITH KELSEY CA --

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.012
WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION WE DO

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.613
THINK THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.749
SOLVE A REAL PROBLEM -- BUT AS

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:13.584
WRITTEN WE BELIEVE IT WOULD MAKE

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:14.852
MATTERS WORSE -- WE DO NEED TO

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:16.520
PROTECT GRADE RELIABILITY -- BUT

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:17.521
WE ALSO NEED TO DO IN A WAY THAT

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:19.023
DOESN'T HURT A RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.091
GOALS.

00:39:20.157 --> 00:39:21.692
SO I'D LIKE TO REMEMBER THAT

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.461
CCA'S WERE CREATED BY THE

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:25.196
LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE MARKET

00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:26.464
STABILITY DURING PEAK GINNY'S

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.698
FIRST BANKRUPTCY.

00:39:27.765 --> 00:39:29.066
AND BACK THEN GAMING BY SOME

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:31.102
ENERGY CORPORATIONS CONTRIBUTED

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:32.503
THE BLACKOUTS AND HIGH RATES.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.739
WE NOW HAVE OPERATING CCA'S AND

00:39:34.805 --> 00:39:35.673
THEIR STRONG INTEREST IN

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.540
STOCKTON AND THROUGHOUT

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:38.342
CALIFORNIAN HAD EXPAND CCA RATE

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:39.944
PAYER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.212
TO INCLUDE EVERYONE.

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:42.613
THE THE CURRENT BILL WOULD HAVE

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.615
A CENTRAL BUYER HANDLE RESOURCE

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.484
ADEQUACY RENEWABLE ENERGY AND

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.552
EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS -- BUT LET'S

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:50.588
CHECK THAT ON RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.056
THE CCA'S ARE CONTRACTING TO

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:53.557
BUILD RESOURCES AT A RECORD HIGH

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:56.260
RATE -- WE'VE ALREADY FINANCE

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:57.428
TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS WE EXPECT

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.562
TO FINANCE A THOUSAND MORE

00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:00.064
MEGAWATTS THIS YEAR ALONE AND WE

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.632
PLAN TO BUILD TEN THOUSAND

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.134
MEGAWATTS BY.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:03.701
TWENTY THIRTY THE I. O. U.'S

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:04.702
HAVE NO NEED TO BUILD NEW

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.036
RESOURCES BECAUSE LOCAL

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.938
GOVERNMENTS ARE VOTING TO FORM

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:09.173
MORE CCA'S.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.941
ON RENEWABLE AT RESOURCE

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:12.777
ADEQUACY OR ARE A THAT MATTER IS

00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:14.545
DIFFERENT IN A BILL THAT FOCUSES

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:16.280
SOLELY ON OUR A WOULD ACTUALLY

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:17.381
BE WELCOME TO US.

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:18.682
IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO ENSURE THE

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.117
CONSTRUCTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.719
ISN'T ACCIDENTALLY STOPPED

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:23.287
BECAUSE CC IS ARE DEVELOPING

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:24.755
THOSE TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS.

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:27.424
FOR BOTH ENERGY AND RELIABILITY

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.393
THOSE TWO FACETS OF A PROJECT

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.195
ALWAYS GO TOGETHER -- AND ARE

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:32.363
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:33.697
RENEWABLE INTEGRATION.

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:35.866
SO ANY HARM TO OR TAKING AWAY

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:37.601
POWERS FOR RESEARCH ADEQUACY

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:39.203
COULD ARMOR ABILITY TO BUILD NEW

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.538
ENERGY SOURCES.

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:41.872
SO WE ARE REACHING OUT TO THE

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:43.307
AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE WOULD LIKE

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:45.309
TO WORK -- TO CREATE A DEFAULT

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:50.014
PROCUREMENT ENTITY FOR RESOURCE

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:50.781
ADEQUACY ALONE.

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:51.515
IT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:52.483
ARE COORDINATED BETWEEN ENERGY

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.551
COMMISSION THE I SO IN THE PC.

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.285
AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW ELECTRIC

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:55.786
PROVIDERS TO BUY RESOURCES AS

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:58.289
THEY DO NOW THE BILL ISN'T AS

00:40:58.355 --> 00:40:58.956
CLEAR ON THAT POINT AS WE WOULD

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.057
LIKE.

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:01.992
THEN AFTER THE LOAD SERVING

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:03.360
ENTITIES HAVE PROCURED THE

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.862
DEFAULT BUYER WITHIN STEP IN AND

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.063
BY ANY REMAINING NEEDED

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.498
RESOURCES AND ASSIGN THE COSTS

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:09.166
IN THAT BACKSTOP MANNER TO

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:10.634
ANYONE WHO DIDN'T PARK HERE.

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.369
AND IT WOULD THOSE COSTS WOULD

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:13.704
FLOW TO THE GENERATION SIDE OF

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:14.939
THE BILL THAT'S ANOTHER

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:16.507
IMPORTANT PIECE WE'D LIKE TO SEE.

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.042
GOOD BACKSTOPS ARGUMENT LIKE

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:18.909
THIS WILL PROTECT OUR GRID

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:20.010
WITHOUT HURTING RATE PAYERS

RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FIFTY SIX

00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:40.231
AS IT'S WRITTEN WE THINK THAT

THE BILL I THAT DOES IDENTIFY A

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:42.633
CRITICAL PROBLEM WHICH IS THE

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.835
LACK OF CENTRALIZED PLANNING AND

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.203
PROCUREMENT OVERSIGHT OVER SOME

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.238
LOADS SERVING ENTITIES.

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.673
WE THINK AB FIFTY SIX PROPOSES

THE WRONG SOLUTION THANK YOU

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:50.541

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:53.577
THANK YOU.

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.145
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JASON I

GILBERT ROPES AND SMITH ON

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.416
BEHALF OF CLEAN POWER SF ALSO IN

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:00.050

THANK YOU.

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:04.255
I SEE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION OR

NO FURTHER COMMENTS -- WILL

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:07.391
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:08.225
DOCTOR QUIRK.

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:10.661
SO THE CHAIR INDICATED AND I

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:12.229
WOULD AGREE WITH HIM THAT WE

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:14.465
NEED A VEHICLE GOING FORWARD TO

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:15.966
DISCUSS THIS PROBLEM.

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:18.669
REGARDLESS OF WHAT.

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:20.571
I MEAN I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT

00:42:20.638 --> 00:42:21.572
TOO BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.173
HAVE THE VEHICLE GOING TO HAVE

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.442
THE DISCUSSION GOING WHICH WAS

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:27.177
ALSO MENTIONED BY THE SPONSOR.

00:42:27.244 --> 00:42:28.612
OF FOR THAT REASON I'LL NOW

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:30.948
MOVED TO BAIL.

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:35.152
IS OUR SECOND.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:38.656
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING.

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:41.825
YOUR I GUESS I GET IT I'M ON THE

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:50.267
COMMITTEE I CAN'T -- JUST THEN

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:51.669
THE COMMENT ON THE BALLOT.

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:52.436
FIRST OF ALL WE DO I'D LIKE TO

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:53.938
ASK THE SPONSOR QUESTION SO WE

00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:55.539
DO HAVE A BACKSTOP NOW.

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:58.876
AND THAT IS THE I SO CAN SAY

00:42:58.943 --> 00:43:00.811
THIS PLANT MáS RYAN --

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:02.746
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A CONTRACT

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:05.182
IN ONE CASE AT LEAST THEY HAS

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:07.017
THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:09.453
TO MAKE CONTRACT -- SO ITS

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.856
RELIABILITY MUST RUN -- AND

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:15.292
FRANKLY I TRUST THE ISO MORE TO

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.827
MAKE THAT DECISION IN THE C. P.

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:19.263
U. C. WHICH IS WHAT'S IN HERE.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.565
THE I SO HAS FAR BETTER MODELS

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:24.535
WE SEEN THE CPUC CHANGE THE I SO

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:26.070
REQUIREMENTS. FOR RESOURCE

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:28.072
ADEQUACY WHICH MAKES NO SENSE AT

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.873
ALL BECAUSE THEY KNOW A LOT LESS

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.141
THE AYE IT SO DOES.

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:32.676
SO MY FIRST COMMENT IS WE

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:34.378
SHOULDN'T BE RELYING ON THE C.

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:37.081
P. U. C. TO THE SIDE RESOURCE

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:39.550
ADEQUACY THAT OUGHT TO BE -- THE

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:43.454
I. S. SHOW -- SECOND -- THERE

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.255
NOW THERE IS A PROCEDURE.

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:50.160
AND I THINK WITH OUR I BELIEVE

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:51.662
THIS THE I SO PERHAPS THE CHAIR

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:52.896
CAN CORRECT ME IF I DON'T HAVE

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:54.531
THIS I BELIEVE THE I SO IS NOW

00:43:54.598 --> 00:43:56.867
STARTING TO LOOK OUT.

00:43:56.934 --> 00:44:00.738
AT ALL A LARGER HORIZON.

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:02.272
MARY CANCER THAT [inaudible]

00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:04.942
ITSELF.

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:05.476
NOT BEING FOCUSED ON WELL

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:06.577
CERTAINLY.

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:08.846
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON A LARGE

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.280
HORIZON WE DO KNOW.

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.116
THAT UNDER THE LAST RESOURCE

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:14.418
ADEQUACY.

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:18.555
LOOK BY THE R. C. P. YOU SEE

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:21.692
THAT -- THERE WASN'T RESOURCE

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:24.361
ADEQUACY -- AND THEY DO NOT HAVE

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:27.865
THE ABILITY. TO TELL THE CCA'S

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:28.832
TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAT'S

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:30.300
NOT.

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.168
WE HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM THAT

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:34.638
AUTHORITY -- AND I WOULD ASK THE

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:38.642
C. C. A.'S -- TWO I THINK THE

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:41.078
BEST THING TO DO HERE IS TO ASK

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:42.379
THE C. C. A.'S.

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:45.549
ARE FOR THEM TO WORK TOGETHER --

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:49.920
ON THIS ISSUE -- WHEN WE HAD?

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:51.655
YOU KNOW ONE UTILITY IN CHARGE

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:53.657
OF A LARGE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA WE

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:54.858
COULD JUST DEPEND UPON THE

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:56.026
UTILITY.

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:58.862
I THINK NOW THAT WE GOING HAVE --

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:04.601
CCA IS AND IN THE SAME TERRITORY

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:08.439
AS I USE -- AND JUST THE

00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:10.340
COMPLEXITY OF THAT -- I WOULD

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:12.910
ASK THEM TO ADD TO WORK.

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:16.713
WITH THE I. AT I USE AND TRYING

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.582
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO COVER

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:20.851
PARTICULAR REGIONS -- AND THEN

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:23.720
FINALLY -- WE DO HAVE A PROCESS

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:27.157
AND I'M NOT SURE IT'S BROKEN BUT

00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:29.359
I DO THINK THAT THE CCA'S HAVE

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.128
TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:32.963
AND HERE THEY SORT OF CUT OUT I

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.933
WANT THEM TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:38.135
AND I KNOW THAT THEY WANT -- TO

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:40.771
TO GET THE PROPER BALANCE ON THE

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:40.971
GRAD.

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:44.608
SO -- THAT THAT'S MY COMMENT I'M

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:46.443
STILL SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:50.147
THINK -- I HOPE THAT -- WELL WE

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:51.748
CAN KEEP THE COMMAS AND PERIODS

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:52.049
[inaudible]

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:53.250
THANK YOU.

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.818
THANK YOU JUST A A SHORT

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:56.353
RESPONSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.855
CURRENTLY THE PC DOES HAVE

00:45:57.921 --> 00:45:59.623
PRIMARY JURISDICTION OVER

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.358
RESOURCE ADEQUACY OVERSIGHT AND

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:02.893
COMPLIANCE BY LOAD SERVING

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.628
ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA -- TO

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:06.296
MOVE THAT PROGRAM ENTIRELY AS TO

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:07.631
THE ISO WOULD BE A PRETTY

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.433
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THIS BILL

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.634
DOESN'T DISTURB THE CURRENT.

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:12.469
SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO A

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.138
JURISDICTION AND AUTHORITY --

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:16.206
AND UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.274
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:19.977
DEFICITS IDENTIFIED THE PC HAS

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.378
THE AUTHORITY AND HAS IN FACT

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:22.346
USE THAT AUTHORITY TO DIRECT THE

00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:23.914
I USED TO GO OUT AND DO LONG

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:25.415
TERM CONTRACTS FOR BRAND NEW

00:46:25.482 --> 00:46:27.251
RESOURCES SAID THAT'S KIND OF

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:27.784
THE DEFAULT.

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:29.419
THAT WE'RE THE WORLD WE'RE

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:31.288
LIVING IN TODAY YES BUT THEY

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:32.923
DON'T ALWAYS FOLLOW THE I SO

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.991
DIRECTION.

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:36.593
AND SO I DON'T TRUST WHAT

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.728
THEY'RE DOING.

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:40.497
THE I. SL KNOWS THEIR MUCH THE

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:41.565
MODELS THAT THEY HAVE THIS TO

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.800
PETE CPUC ARE INFERIOR AND YET

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:44.835
THEY WILL CHANGE WHAT THE ISO

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:47.804
RECOMMEND SO THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:49.806
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT TAKEN

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:52.209
CARE OF BUT THE OTHER THING IS.

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:53.877
I MEAN WE REALLY HAVE.

00:46:53.944 --> 00:46:55.179
TO I WAS NEVER IN FAVOR OF

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:56.713
HAVING CCA'S BUT NOW THAT

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.081
THEY'RE HERE.

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.783
I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.985
THEM TOGETHER WITH ALL THE LOAD

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.453
SERVING ENERGIESIN THE REGION

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.189
AND TO WORK THESE THINGS OUT

00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:09.826
TOGETHER BEFORE WE HAVE

00:47:09.893 --> 00:47:12.062
GOVERNMENT -- SAME THIS OR THAT

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:13.030
I THINK THE I SO IS REALLY THE

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:13.597
ONLY ONE WHO CAN TELL US.

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:14.865
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S RESOURCE

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.767
ADEQUACY AND I THINK THEN WE

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.635
SHOULD RELY ON THE CCA'S TO WORK

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:20.204
WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.271
UTILITIES.

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.574
AND TO GET A GOVERNMENT AGENCY

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.009
INVOLVED.

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:27.244
I'M NOT REALLY QUITE READY FOR

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:29.213
THAT BUT WE DO NEED TO DISCUSS

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:30.881
IT JUST TO CLARIFY THIS BILL

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:32.482
DOES NOT I'M SORRY.

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:34.451
WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA YEAH YEAH

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.486
OF THE PERSON.

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:40.991
ADDRESSED HER UP. ONE AT A LINE

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:42.826
OF MY CONCERNS WITH THE MIST

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:45.229
QUIRK -- WANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.030
SOMETHING HERE FROM AN FOR THE

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:47.898
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON THE

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:50.234
PLANET [inaudible]

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.536
WE ARE.

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:53.837
ALMOST TWENTY YEARS INTO THE

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:56.540
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:57.574
AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.076
UNCERTAIN WHAT ITS ELECTRICITY

00:47:59.142 --> 00:48:00.611
GRID IS GONNA LOOK LIKE GOING

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:03.480
FORWARD LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:05.515
WE ARE ESSENTIALLY I THINK

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:06.817
SLOWLY.

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:08.752
DISINTEGRATING THE GRADE THAT WE

00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:10.654
HAVE HAD SERVE US WELL FOR A

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:13.757
LONG LONG TIME.

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:15.158
AND I RECOGNIZE.

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:17.628
THE NECESSITY TO AT LEAST HAVE

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:19.296
THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:19.596
[inaudible]

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:21.198
I WOULD.

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.966
SUGGEST THAT THE P. YOU SEE DOES

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:24.701
NOT.

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:26.837
HAVE THE FAVOR I THINK OF THIS

00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:29.172
COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT TO THAT

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:33.977
KIND OF DECISION ON ON AYE AYE --

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:36.313
APPRECIATE THE DOCTOR QUIRKS.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.881
COMMENT ON THIS.

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.416
I THINK MY OVERARCHING CONCERN

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:41.585
IS THAT THIS.

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:43.020
I DON'T THINK IS READY FOR PRIME

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:45.122
TIME JUST YET.

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:46.523
I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.292
THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THERE'S

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:52.529
GOT TO BE A SERIOUS -- PLANNING --

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.731
OVER THE NEXT PERIOD OF TIME

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:57.067
HERE -- AS I SAID I MEAN WITH

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:58.502
THIS THAT TWENTY YEARS IN THE

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.304
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY OUT WE WE

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.239
HAVE A HUGE ECONOMY. TO ENERGIZE

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:05.142
KEEP ENERGIZED AND TO HAVE IT

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:06.743
RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:07.978
THE SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:10.180
WE'VE SEEN RELIABILITY GO DOWN

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:14.818
AND IF AT AT AT AT AND OF AND

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:15.752
AFFORDABILITY GO DOWN.

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:16.386
AT AS A RESULT WE ARE WHERE WE

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:17.654
ARE.

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.189
I'M I'M PREPARED AND I THINK

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:22.359
THIS COMMITTEES PREPARED TO LOOK

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:26.229
AT WHAT THAT NEXT -- GRADE

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:26.530
[inaudible]

00:49:26.596 --> 00:49:28.432
LOOKS LIKE.

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:30.200
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE.

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:32.402
CAREFUL MORE CAREFUL.

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:34.371
A LITTLE BIT SLOWER.

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:35.539
AND HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:38.375
ABOUT THIS -- AND I WOULD JUST

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:40.077
SAY WHAT TROUBLES ME THE MOST IS

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:42.179
THIS FEELS LIKE.

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:43.313
THAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO END

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.382
WITH IS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:46.950
IS DICTATORIAL AND THAT CAN

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:48.452
COMMAND.

00:49:48.518 --> 00:49:52.389
AND WHEN THAT COMMAND IS -- DONE

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:53.657
IT WILL BE THE RATE PAYERS THAT

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:55.592
WILL.

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.728
BE FORCED TO TO PAY FOR THAT I'M

00:49:57.794 --> 00:49:59.229
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:01.631
AS WELL SO FOR THOSE REASONS I

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:03.066
DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:06.103
THIS -- CONVERSATION AND WE DO

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.771
NEED A A A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.373
GRID SOLUTION BUT I THINK THAT

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:10.040
TAKES.

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:12.275
DEEP THINKING ALL PARTIES AT THE

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:14.311
TABLE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:16.446
MANY PEOPLE IN THIS SPACE ON

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:17.581
WINNERS IN.

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:18.849
OPPOSITION AND NOT AND ON OTHER

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:21.151
SITES I THINK ARGUES FOR THAT

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:22.619
KIND OF CONVERSATION SO I'M

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:23.420
GONNA.

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:25.856
LAY OFF THE BILL -- I DO THINK

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.391
THAT THERE HAS TO BE MUCH MORE

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.725
WORK ON IT AND I'M GOING TO

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:30.193
RESERVE MY FINAL VOTE FOR THE

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.662
FLOOR.

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:33.296
THROUGH THE CHAIR THE CHAIR CAN

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:36.566
I YES -- I JUST LIKE TO DRESS

00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:38.135
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON I

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.637
AGREE -- WE SHOULDN'T BE HERE WE

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:41.605
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PREPARED

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.039
BUT THE REALITY IS WITH THE

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:44.875
SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES

00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:47.144
IN WE DO HAVE -- I USE THAT ARE

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.613
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY WE DO HAVE --

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:51.815
RELIABILITY ISSUES ON THE BRINK

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.750
AND THE REALITY IS IS WE HAVE TO

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:54.951
WE ARE FOR WE HAVE.

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:56.586
PUT OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WE

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:58.422
ARE FORCED TO HAVE THIS

00:50:58.488 --> 00:50:59.322
CONVERSATION NOW.

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:01.224
WE NEED A BACKSTOP WE DO NOT

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:03.493
HAVE AN OPTION AND I THINK.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.295
AN OPPOSITE I SEE WHAT YOU HOW

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:05.862
YOU SEE THESE POINTERS AS

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:07.697
OPPOSITE YES IT IS A VERY VERY

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:08.999
COMPLEX ISSUE.

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:10.767
AND YES IT IS TAKING A LOT OF

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.369
TIME EVEN JUST TO GET HERE BUT

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:13.804
AS YOU SEE PEOPLE MOVING FROM

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.272
OPPOSITION IN THIS LONG LINE OF

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:17.140
TRAINERS THAT IS A SHOW OF THE

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:18.642
FACT THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT WE

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:19.843
ARE WORKING WITH THAT THE AUTHOR

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.111
IS WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE.

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:22.646
THAT WE ARE MOVING THE NEEDLE ON

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.080
WHERE THEY SHOULD GO IN

00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:25.482
NARROWING IT SO THAT IT IS NOT

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:27.484
DICTATORIAL SO THAT IT IS

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:29.019
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.620
BE WHICH IS A BACKSTOPS AN

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:32.055
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A LARGE

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:33.223
ENOUGH PLACE WHERE WE CAN

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.459
ACTUALLY. FOR CARE AND NOT FOR

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:37.661
TO REDUCE THE RATES FOR FOLKS SO

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.262
I THINK THAT THE INTENTION AND

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:40.230
THE MOON.

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:42.065
DIRECTION IN WHICH THIS BILL IS

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:45.135
MOVING IN IS IS CORRECT AND AND

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:47.037
UNFORTUNATELY I WISH WE HAD TEN

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.072
YEARS TO DEAL WITH THIS.

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:50.173
BUT WE DON'T WE HAVE PLACED

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.275
OURSELVES ANY SITUATION WITH THE

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:53.276
I. YOU USE IN THE WAY THAT WE

00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:55.178
DID TO ARE THOSE WHO DESIGNED

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:57.180
THE SYSTEM BEFORE US.

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:57.814
DID.

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.149
AND SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS I

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:00.317
THINK WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:02.085
EVERYBODY IN THIS LINE EVEN THE

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:03.787
OPPOSITION HAS SAID ONE THING.

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:04.855
THAT THEY KNOW THAT THIS A

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.389
SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE FOUND AND

00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:08.959
THAT THIS IS IN THE SCOPE OF THE

00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:10.160
SOLUTION NOT PERFECT.

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:12.028
NEEDS WORK NEEDS TO BE WORKED

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:13.830
WITH WITH THE CCA'S BUT MOST

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:16.066
DEFINITELY PART OF THE SOLUTION

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:17.167
THAT NEEDS TO BE FOUND AT LEAST

00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:18.301
A PORTION OF IT.

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:19.436
AND I THINK ALMOST EVERY SINGLE

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:20.470
PERSON THAT HAS STOOD UP FOR

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:22.539
SPOKEN TODAY HAS SAID SOME

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:23.306
VERSION OF THAT EXCEPT FOR I

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.075
THINK TWO HUNDRED TWO THE I SO

00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:26.543
IS NOT IDENTIFIED THE SYSTEM

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.245
DEFICIENCY SO.

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:29.312
THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:31.147
THAT THE CPC ALSO RECENTLY

00:52:31.214 --> 00:52:33.183
ACCEPTED OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.284
A THREE YEAR OBLIGATION PRETTY

00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:35.585
RECENTLY IS ONLY A ONE YEAR

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.454
OBLIGATION FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY.

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:40.657
AND SO I THINK WE'RE MOVING ON

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:41.992
THE RIGHT TRACK [inaudible]

00:52:42.058 --> 00:52:44.461
DR.

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:46.062
WHAT I AND I I DO REALLY I DO

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.531
APPRECIATE THIS I REALLY DO?

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:48.899
I'M NOT SAYING WE HAVE TEN YEARS

00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:50.433
OUT I THINK THE P. JEANNIE

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.902
BANKRUPTCY.

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:53.937
PROBABLY AS A TWO OR THREE YEAR.

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.672
SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES I KNOW THAT

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:58.074
WE OFTENTIMES IN THE MIDST OF

00:52:58.141 --> 00:53:00.010
CRISIS WE SAY WE'VE GOT TO DO

00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:01.611
SOMETHING.

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.780
AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WE DO THE

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:06.283
RIGHT THING I DO THINK THERE ARE

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:09.185
INCOMPLETE PIECES IN HERE AND WE

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:11.021
HAVE EXPRESSED SOME OF THOSE.

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:13.757
INCOMPLETE PIECES AND THAT'S WHY

00:53:13.823 --> 00:53:15.091
PRESENTLY I'M GONNA LAY OFF

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:16.960
APPRECIATE THE THE CONVERSATION

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:19.095
I REALLY DO.

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:19.729
YEAH WELL I THINK WE ALSO MY

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:21.164
BROKEN RECORDS I THINK WE ALL

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.766
SHARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS I

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.668
ALSO THINK THAT I A SO IS THE

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:25.936
BETTER A BODY.

00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:27.504
I GET TIRED OF US GIVING MORE TO

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:29.139
THE C. P. U. C. TO DO AND THEN

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:30.040
BRING THEM IN HERE BEATING THEM

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.207
UP NOT DOING.

00:53:31.274 --> 00:53:32.175
EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE ASKED THEM

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.977
TO DO AND WE JUST PILE ON SOME

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.979
MORE IS THAT THAT IS COUNTER

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:39.482
INTUITIVE DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE --

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:40.784
AND I REPRESENT AG DISTRICT AND

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:41.985
THERE WHEN WE USED TO HAVE A TON

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:43.053
OF PROCESSING WE DON'T HAVE

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:44.154
ANYMORE BECAUSE THE COST OF

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.989
ENERGY IS IS TO PRICES PEOPLE

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:48.058
OUT I MEAN WE MUST ADDRESS THE

00:53:48.124 --> 00:53:49.392
ISSUE OF COST.

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:51.928
AND RELIABILITY -- AND IT'S YOU

00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:53.229
KNOW IT'S TOO BAD I THINK

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:54.397
AUTHORS NOT HERE AND AND SOME

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.732
MEMBER BURKE IS IN A FANTASTIC

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.167
JOB OF STEPPING UP AND STEPPING

00:53:57.233 --> 00:54:00.370
IN -- BUT THE SPACE IT NEEDS I

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:01.438
MEAN THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:03.139
CAN DO QUICKLY I FIND MYSELF

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:04.007
ALIGNING MYSELF WITH MR PATERSON

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.976
SAYING BUT SOME WE NEED TO MOVE

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:08.078
BUT SOMETIMES MOVING TOO QUICKLY.

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:11.147
IS AS BAD AS NOT MOVING AT ALL --

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:12.015
SO I THINK WE NEED TO GET THIS

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.249
RIGHT AND GO TO NATURAL

00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:15.218
RESOURCES NEXUS AT WHERE IT WILL

00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:19.189
GO ALRIGHT.

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:22.559
SO I WILL BE ORDERING IT THERE.

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:23.860
SUMMER SEARCH.

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:26.229
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT -- TO

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:28.365
HIGHLIGHT THE CONCERN THAT ICE

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:30.033
IS C. AND THE CAL CCA LETTER

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.035
THAT.

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.004
TO WHILE THIS IS BEING PRESENTED

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:36.439
AS FOR A BACKSTOP THAT THE LESS

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:38.041
THAN GRANT OF AUTHORITY IS BROAD

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:39.709
ENOUGH THAT THERE'S CONCERN AT

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.711
LEAST THAT THE AUTHORITY COULD

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.713
BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.915
REGARDING PROCUREMENT AND SO YOU

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:47.550
KNOW I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:51.588
HAS A LARGE -- PARTS OF IT THAT --

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:53.323
ARE COMING UNDER THIS --

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.392
EXCITING TO NEW CLEAN POWER

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:59.629
ALLIANCE -- A PROJECT AND I I

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:04.434

AND I THINK THAT THE

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:10.233
RECOMMENDATION -- THAT WERE

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.302
MAKING IS TO KEEP THE BILL

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:13.837
MOVING ALONG WE KNOW THAT THIS

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:18.541
IS A COMPLICATED A SUBJECT --

00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:20.744
AND BUT WHAT IS A COMPLICATED IN

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:23.146
THIS -- IN THIS PARTICULAR LINE.

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:24.581
OF BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.149
TO BE MINDFUL AND WE DID GET A

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:28.785
SIGNAL FROM THE PC PRESIDENT AND

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:29.352
ARE.

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:30.820
A HEARING ABOUT A MONTH OR TWO

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:33.490
AGO WHERE HE INDICATED THAT.

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:35.358
MOVING TO SOME TYPE OF A

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:37.594
BACKSTOP OR CENTRAL PROCUREMENT

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.729
AUTHORITY WAS GOING TO HAVE TO

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:40.964
HAPPEN AT SOME POINT SO I THINK

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:42.532
THAT THE CONVERSATION IN THE

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.534
MARKET PLACES TO SUGGEST THAT.

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:46.035
WE ARE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES

00:56:46.102 --> 00:56:47.670
HAVING TO GET TO THIS PLACE.

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:49.606
AND SO IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE'S

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:51.508
RESPONSIBILITY SORT OF GET THEIR

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:53.476
ARMS AROUND THIS ISSUE TO TRY TO

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:57.147
FIGURE OUT HOW. TO PROPOSED BACK

00:56:57.213 --> 00:56:59.449
AT LEAST TO A PROCESSOR SYSTEM

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:01.684
THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.853
APPROPRIATE -- TO GET US INTO

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.921
THE AREA GET US INTO THE

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.823
CONVERSATION TO ALLOW US TO LOOK

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.058
AT SOME TYPE OF A STRUCTURE THAT

00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:11.094
WOULD AT LEAST.

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:13.696
A COMPLIMENT -- THE END GOAL BUT

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:15.832
ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WE WEREN'T

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.333

TO OPINE ON IN IN GREATER DETAIL --

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:30.580
BUT WE DO THINK THAT THIS --

00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:32.882
PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE -- ALLOWS

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:34.384

WITH ME THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.021
SUPPORTERS.

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:07.490

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:18.501

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.469
KNOW WE'VE BEEN SECOND RATE

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.471
REFORM CHANGES SINCE AT LEAST

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:22.738
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:23.372
THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE WERE ABLE

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:24.640
TO GET AB THREE TWENTY SEVEN

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:25.575
APPROVED WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:26.876
FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:28.578
RATES ARE CONCERNED OUR RATES IN

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.912
SAN DIEGO ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.047
IN THE STATE.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:32.548
LAST YEAR IN WORKING WITH SOME

01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:34.450
REMEMBER BURKE AND OTHERS -- BUT

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:35.785
WE DID A REVIEW OF WHAT THE OF

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.787
MANDATED PROGRAM COSTS WERE

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.322
WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY.

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:40.857
AND WE ESTIMATED NINE HUNDRED

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.291
AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:44.293
A YEAR OUT OF REVENUE OF JUST

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.262
OVER FOUR BILLION SO IT'S A VERY

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.097
SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF OUR REVENUE

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.098
THAT COMES IN.

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:50.566
IF YOU PUT THAT IN CONTEXT ON

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:51.868
WHILE FOR MITIGATION WE'VE BEEN

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.569
WORKING ON MITIGATION EFFORTS

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:54.170
FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOW AND WE'VE

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:55.938
SPENT JUST OVER ONE POINT ONE

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:56.973
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:02:57.039 --> 01:03:00.610
SO THE MANDATED PROGRAMS ARE

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:01.677
VERY SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR OF

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:02.378
OUR RATES WERE ALSO WORKING WITH

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.413
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE ON TEN

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:04.914
EIGHTY THREE WHICH THIS

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:05.581
COMMITTEE WILL HERE IN A COUPLE

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:06.649
WEEKS.

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.084
AND THAT SEEKS TO TAKEN EARLIER

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:10.086
LOOK AT IT BEFORE THE COMMITTEES

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:12.088
DECIDE MOVING FORWARD ON A BILL

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.389
TO IDENTIFY.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.591
IN A HOLISTIC WAY MOST BILLS

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:17.126
THAT WE IN THE UTILITY INDUSTRY

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:19.529
WORK ON ARE A MATTER OF COST

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.297
IMPLICATIONS BETWEEN ONE GREAT

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:22.465
PAIR CLASS FIRST ANOTHER.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.534
AND WE THINK THESE THIS FOCUS ON

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.235
WHAT THOSE IMPACTS ARE ON

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:28.471
REPAIRS IS IMPORTANT AND

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.806
THEREFORE WE SUPPORT THE BILL.

FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF TURN IN

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:36.712
SUPPORT -- WE LIKE THE FACT THAT

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.648
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:39.815
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:40.816
INCLUDE THE COST OF THESE

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:43.553
MANDATED PROGRAMS ON A PER THERM

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:45.254
OR PER KILOWATT HOUR BASIS.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.789
IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT TO THE

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:49.325
LEGISLATURE AND AS AN ATTACHMENT

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.394
TO EACH AGENDA TO A PC BUSINESS

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.361
MEETING.

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:53.796
I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:56.199
WE HAVE THE IS THE PC TENDS TO

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:57.867
LOOK AT EACH PROPOSED SPENDING

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.368
ITEM ON ITS AGENDA IN COMPLETE

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:00.670
ISOLATION.

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:01.837
AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:03.639
CUMULATIVE INCREASES THAT THEY

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:04.907
HAD TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.509
IT BEGINS TO FEEL A LOT LIKE

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:08.444
FREE MONEY -- WITH NO HARD TRADE

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.979
OFFS THAT NEED TO BE MADE WE

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:11.747
THINK THAT THIS BILL IS A VERY

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:12.348
SMALL.

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:14.183
BUT MEANINGFUL STEP.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.885
TOWARDS FORCING THE REGULATORS

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.186
TO GRAPPLE WITH THE CUMULATIVE

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.188
IMPACTS OF ALL OF THE CHOICES

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:20.356
THAT ARE BEING MADE BOTH BY THE

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:21.591
LEGISLATURE.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:22.858
AND THE CHOICES THAT THEY HAVE

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:23.392
BEFORE THEM AT A BUSINESS

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.294
MEETING -- WE DO HAVE A CRISIS

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:26.362
OF AFFORDABILITY HERE IN

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:27.697

NUMBERS OF SHOT OFTEN PEOPLE

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:31.067
BEHIND ON BILL PAYMENT -- AND WE

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:32.201
NEED TO GET THE REGULATORS TO

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:34.103
FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON THE

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.438
FACT THAT EVERY TIME THEY

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:36.405
APPROVE AN ADDITIONAL RATE

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:37.440
INCREASE THERE ARE REAL

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.308
CONSEQUENCES -- AND WHEN YOU ADD

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:40.243
THEM TO ALL OF THE MANDATED

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.544
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:44.380

OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.120
IT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:26.555

AND YOU'LL BE SURE OF THAT.

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:35.097
EVEN THOUGH I LAST LOTS OF

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:38.668
QUESTIONS -- ONE IS THAT YOU'RE

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:39.935
GONNA BE LOOKING.

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:42.438
LOOKING AT SECTION NINE THIRTEEN

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:43.005
LIFE.

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.007
LET THE STAFF KNOW THAT I HAVE A

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:46.075
CONCERN HERE.

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:47.643
IT SAYS THAT YOU LOOK AT EACH

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.812
PROGRAM MANDATE MANDATED BY

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:52.315
STATUTE AND ITS ANNUAL COSTS TO

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:54.650
RATEPAYERS THAT'S PARAGRAPH.

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:56.485
ONE PARAGRAPH TO IS EACH PROGRAM

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:58.187
MANDATED BY THE COMMISSION ITS

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:00.790
ANNUAL COST TO TRACK TO

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:01.791
TAXPAYERS.

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:03.859
BUT THEN AND BELOW IT JUST SAYS

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:06.128
DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH ONE I

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:07.630
THINK YOU WANT PARAGRAPHS ONE

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:12.968
AND TWO IS THAT CORRECT OR NOT.

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:14.537
OKAY THAT'S PROBABLY CORRECT.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:16.205
THE OTHER PART.

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:18.674
IS I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU DIVIDE

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:20.643
UP.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.445
LET'S JUST TAKE THE LAST THE

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:24.080
FIRST BILL WE HEARD FRIEDMAN

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:24.580
SPELL.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:26.482
OUT SAYING THE COMMUNITY SHOULD

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.384
HAVE A GRID.

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.019
AND THAT TAKES ES DE UP MONEY

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:32.755
AND SET IT UP FOR COMMUNITY.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.423
NOW I COMMUNITY WHEN YOU FIRST

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:35.758
START OUT COULD HAVE NO

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.027
COMMERCIAL AND THEN A WEEK LATER

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:40.062
COMMERCIAL COMES IN AND THEN

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.797
MAYBE AN INDUSTRY COMES IN.

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:44.066
AND MAYBE THERE'S MORE FAR MEAN

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.135
IT'S HARD TO SAY HOW WHEN YOU

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:48.471
HELP A WHOLE COMMUNITY IT SHOULD

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:49.405
BE DIVIDED UP.

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.674
LET'S TAKE -- THE PROGRAM ON

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.309
BATTERY PROCUREMENT.

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.010
SOME OF THAT WILL BE IN HOMES

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.245
AND I GUESS THAT YOU COULD SAY

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:58.080
IS RESIDENTIAL SOME OF THAT'S

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.615
GOING TO BE DONE BY INDUSTRY.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:02.184
BUT OTHERS JUST PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:06.822
SELLING -- BATTERIES ARE POWER

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.658
TO INDUSTRY OR HOMES OR WHATEVER

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:11.394
SO THAT THEY CAN DISPLACE THE

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.596
LOAD WHEN THEY HAVE TO PAY THE

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:14.864
HIGHER LOAD.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.532
SO HOW YOU KNOW IT MAY BE

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.234
DIVIDED UP A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:18.934
WAYS.

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.269
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF PROGRAMS

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:21.604
THAT I THINK YOU'D HAVE A HARD

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.106
TIME DIVIDING UP INTO THESE FOUR

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.408
PARTS.

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:27.109
AND YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF JUST

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.644
SAYING WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:29.979
COST OF PROGRAMS.

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:31.714
AND THEN AFTER THE FACT MAYBE

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.283
MAKE AN ANALYSIS OF HOW MUCH

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.152
WENT TO EACH BUT I'M JUST

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:39.255
QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:39.989
DO AN ACCURATE.

01:07:40.055 --> 01:07:41.357
DIVISION I THINK YOU CAN GET A

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.325
NUMBER FOR EACH PROGRAM AND YOU

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.660
CAN HAVE AN IDEA.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.229
BUT TO ASK FOR ACCURACY I I

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:47.830
DON'T THINK YOU CAN QUITE GET

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:50.833
THERE.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.334
YET JUST IN RESPONSE TO THAT AS

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:53.702
PART OF OUR GENERATE CASES IN

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.171
FACE TO THE COMMISSION DECIDES

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.672
WHAT PORTION OF THE TOTAL

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:57.973
REVENUE REQUIREMENT GETS

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.742
ASSIGNED TO COMMERCIAL CLASS AG

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:01.477
CLASS RESIDENTIAL CLASS.

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:02.511
AND THOUGH THAT'S HOW WOULD BE

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.180
FIGURED OUT AMONGST THE

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.581
DIFFERENT RATE CLASSES AS PART

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:06.849
OF OUR HIZO FOR S. YET THEY'LL

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:11.153
MAKE SOME SORT OF AN ARBITRARY I

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.156
DON'T HOW WORK SPECIFIC CHANGE --

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:14.757
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT ESCAPE HAS

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:15.324
ITS OWN REVENUE REQUIREMENT

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:16.225
ATTACHED TO IT THE REVENUE

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.427
REQUIREMENT IS -- MOVED INTO THE

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:19.428
RATE STRUCTURE THROUGH --

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:21.030
REVENUE ALLOCATION PROCESS AND

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.264
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE WHEN

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:23.065
YOU HAVE A STRAIGHT UP REVENUE

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:24.700
REQUIREMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:26.335
THE IMPACT IS ON A CENTS PER

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:28.204
KILOWATT HOUR BASIS OR CENTS PER

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.538
THERM BASIS FOR INDIVIDUAL

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:30.639
CUSTOMERS.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:31.807
I THINK THE HARDER CASE THAT YOU

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:33.175
MIGHT BE POINTING AT OUR

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.677
PROGRAMS THAT DON'T HAVE AN

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.012
EXPLICIT REVENUE REQUIREMENT

01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:38.180
ATTACHED TO THEM MOVING SO A

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.315
MANDATE WHERE PROCUREMENT

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:40.883
HAPPENS AND THE QUESTION BECOMES

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.618
WELL HOW MUCH DID THAT COST.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.119
AND REALLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:46.388
WHAT IS THE ABOVE MARKET COST

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:47.423
WHAT'S THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:48.090
THAT.

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:49.358
AND I THINK MAYBE IF THE

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:50.726
COMMISSION CAN'T ANSWER SOME OF

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.661
THESE QUESTIONS THAT RAISES SOME

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:55.164
INTERESTING AVENUES FOR FURTHER

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:55.798
WORK BY THE COMMISSION TO FIGURE

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:56.465
OUT.

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:58.267
HOW THEY ESTABLISH THE COST

01:08:58.334 --> 01:08:59.401
EFFECTIVENESS OF SOME OF THESE

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:00.302
INITIATIVES ALRIGHT WELL PERHAPS

01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:02.571
IF THERE COULD BE SOME LANGUAGE

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:05.941
TO JUST -- RECOGNIZED THAT.

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.276
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ASK THEM TO

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.645
DO THE IMPOSSIBLE BUT TO GET

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:10.746
THEIR BEST ESTIMATE.

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:21.323
COLLECTED.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.491
SO THAT IT WON'T BE OPPOSED TO

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:23.893
ANYTHING THAT NOTHING THAT'S

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:26.495
IMPOSSIBLE OR LIKE THAT WILL BE

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.697

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:34.837
THINGS THAT ARE POSSIBLE AND

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:37.473
IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY OUT THERE

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.041

BENEFITS -- WHEN WE DRAW SOME OF

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:43.946
THESE HARD LINES THAT WE DON'T

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:45.414
LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HEALTH

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:48.250
IMPROVEMENTS -- AIR QUALITY

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.052
SOMETIMES.

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:51.587
WE DON'T TAKE INTO THAT ANALYSIS

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:52.755
AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:53.722
DOING.

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:55.558

SAID DIFFERENT TYPES OF HUMAN

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:03.365

AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.170
THINK THAT THIS REPORT IN THE

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:08.938
THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:10.673
WORKING ON I'M SO THAT WE CAN

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.107
KIND OF GET TO AN ANALYSIS OF

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:13.409

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:14.143

HOWEVER HERE THE STEEP UC'S

DETERMINE THE REASONABLE RATES

CHARGED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:38.886
BUSINESSES.

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:40.588
CPUC IS ALREADY RAMPING UP ITS

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:42.590
EXPERTISE IN SAFETY TO RESPOND

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:44.058
TO THE EVER INCREASING THREAT OF

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.159
WILDFIRES IN CLIMATE RELATED

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:46.694
ISSUES WHICH FOCUSES RIGHTLY A

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.262
PRIORITY OF THE STATE.

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:50.264
WITH WILDFIRES INCREASING ENERGY

01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:51.799
COSTS AND OTHER CRISES FACING

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:53.468
CPUC THIS YEAR ADDING ON THE

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:54.669
BURDEN OF DEVELOPING IN ANOTHER

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:59.374
AREA OF EXPERTISE IS A CHALLENGE.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.008
THIS BILL SEEKS TO INCORPORATE

01:28:00.074 --> 01:28:00.642
PRIORITIZE A NEW DEFINITION IN

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:01.576
THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:03.344
PERFORMED BY THE CPUC.

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:05.146
AND USES QUITE A BROAD CATEGORY

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.280
TO GUIDE THE DEFINITION ON ENTRY

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:07.582
TO BENEFITS WELL WE DO

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:08.616
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:09.484
WILLINGNESSTO ACCEPT THE

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:10.885
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS LIVING THE

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.387
SCOPE OF NON ENERGY BENEFITS TO

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:13.688
CERTAIN PROGRAMS.

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:14.455
WE BELIEVE THE DISCUSSION TO

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:16.124
CONTINUE AS A C. P. YOU SEE A

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:17.792
STUDY THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST AND

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:18.860
IT'S INDICATED THAT THESE

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.194
BENEFITS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY.

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:21.963
AND ARE PARTICULARLY UNRELIABLE

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.464
BECAUSE THEY LARGELY RELY ON

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:25.066
SELF REPORTING CUSTOMER SURVEYS

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.367
RATHER THAN THE EMPIRICAL DATA

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:28.002
IT STUDIES THE TYPICALLY GUIDE A

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:29.337
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS.

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:30.638
FINALLY WE BELIEVE THAT SHIFTING

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:31.906
OF SOCIETAL COSTS AND BENEFITS

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.675
SOLELY ON TO WRITE PAPERS.

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.043
RATE THE RATE PAYERS IS NOT

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:36.744
APPROPRIATE DELEGATION OF

01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:37.712
AUTHORITY TO THIS RATE MAKING

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.247
AGENCY. FOR THESE REASONS CAL

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:41.783
CHEAPER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES AB

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:42.417
NINE SIXTY ONE AND LOOKS FOR TO

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:43.718
CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUR

01:28:43.785 --> 01:28:47.288

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:47.822

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:49.390

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.659
OKAY WELL THANK YOU.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:54.929
ANYONE ELSE OKAY.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:55.930
I CHAIR MEMBERS OR DOES HE

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.899
MENACE WITH SEMPRA ENERGY ALSO

01:28:57.965 --> 01:28:58.733
IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AT THE

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.302
MOMENT -- WE APPRECIATE THE

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:02.403
AUTHOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:03.938
WILL REVIEW THOSE FURTHER TO SEE

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:05.573
WHERE WE MIGHT STAND -- MOVING

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.475
FORWARD BUT NOW WE APPRECIATE

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:09.577
THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BILL --

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:11.512
BUT AS AT THE ORIGINAL AS

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:12.046
WRITTEN WE THOUGHT IT WAS

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:14.549
DEPICTED IN MAY BE COSTLY SO

01:29:14.615 --> 01:29:15.083
WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:16.017
DISCUSSION [inaudible]

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:17.251
THANK YOU.

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:18.786
SEEING NO OTHER SPEAKERS IN

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:20.521
OPPOSITION WILL BRING BACK TO

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:23.091
THE COMMITTEE AND DOCTOR QUIRK.

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:25.259
SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:27.462
ALL WORKS BECAUSE MOST OF OUR

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:29.597
PROCUREMENT.

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.132
IT'S GOING TO BE DONE BY THE

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.301
CCA'S THE COMMUNITY CHOICE

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:35.403
AGGREGATORS.

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.772
AND ON THE P. YOU SEE IS NOT

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:39.107
SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:41.008
WHAT TO DO.

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:46.781
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT -- I'M NOT

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:51.686
CCA

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:54.255
SOLAR IN A PARTICULAR AREA --

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:56.257
BUT SAYS CLEAN ENERGY AND ENERGY

01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:57.925
EFFICIENCY I COULD SEE.

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.727
OR IT WANTS TO DO AND ENERGY

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:01.829
EFFICIENCY PROGRAM CAN THE CPUC

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:05.299
EVEN TELL THE CCA WHAT TO DO --

01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:07.935
SO THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND AS

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:09.470
AS IT'S WRITTEN -- WE DON'T

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.305
BELIEVE TOUCHES PROCUREMENT AT

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:14.242
THAT LEVEL -- SO REALLY THE BILL

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:16.310
ALLOWS THE CPUC TO CONSIDER

01:30:16.377 --> 01:30:17.879
THESE NON ENERGY BENEFITS WHEN

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:20.481
MAKING DECISIONS ON D. E. R. SO

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:21.783
DOESN'T PRESCRIBE ANYTHING

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:25.186
DOESN'T FORCE THEM TO DIRECT --

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.888
RESOURCES IN A PARTICULAR AREA.

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:28.222
AND IT ALSO DOESN'T CHANGE

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:29.557
EXISTING COST EFFECTIVENESS

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.292
TESTS IT'S A SUPPLEMENTAL LAYER

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:33.394
OF ANALYSIS WHICH PERMITS THE

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:35.530
CPUC TO CONSIDER CO BENEFITS

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:36.864
LIKE HEALTH WORKFORCE

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:39.867
DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABILITY -- SO

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.836
TO YOUR QUESTION I I DON'T SHARE

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:44.372
THAT -- AS A CONCERN -- AND

01:30:44.438 --> 01:30:45.406
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE C.

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:46.674
P. YOU SEE TO MAKE SURE THE

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:50.044
SCOPE IS LIMITED AND EASY.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.445
TO IMPLEMENT SO WHAT PROGRAMS

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:53.848
WOULD BE AFFECTED SO THE LATE

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:55.183
NIGHT ENERGY PROCUREMENT IF THE

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:57.718
LISTED PROGRAMS UNDER D. E. R. --

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:59.086
IT'S A SERIES OF PROGRAM SO I

01:30:59.153 --> 01:31:00.087
DON'T WANT TO MISS QUOTE THE

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:03.124
ACTUAL NUMBER -- BUT WE GAVE A

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.759
CITATION TO THE PUBLIC.

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:06.994
UTILITIES CODE SECTION THAT

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:10.431
LISTS OUT THOSE PROGRAMS --

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:11.732
CESAR LIST IN THE ANALYSIS

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.968
PERHAPS THERE IS A PARTIAL LIST

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:17.438
IN THE ANALYSIS -- SO IT'S AN

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:19.640
IDEAL EXAMPLE RIGHT -- AND I

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:21.309
COME TO THIS AND WAS PASSIONATE

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:23.678
ABOUT THIS ISSUE AS REGULATORY

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:25.179
PRACTITIONER AT THE CPUC --

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:27.515
WOULD BE IN THE CONTEXT OF A

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:30.885
PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM -- SO --

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:33.521
LUCY AND ABIGAIL HAVE BEEN

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:35.122
PARTICIPATING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.257
VALLEY PROCEEDING WHERE WE'RE

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:37.425
PILOTING NEW CLEAN ENERGY

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:38.960
PROJECTS.

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.127
IN THE COURSE OF THAT PROCEEDING

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:42.196
WE HAD TO ARGUE VERY HARD FOR

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:43.497
THINGS LIKE HEALTH AND

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:44.732
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO BE

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.334
CONSIDERED IN THE P. UC'S

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.802
DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:49.203
AUTHORIZE THOSE PILOTS.

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:51.606
THIS BILL GIVES OPENS THE DOOR

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:54.675
FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO CONSIDER.

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:55.276
THOSE OTHER CO BENEFITS WHEN

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.844
THEY MAKE THEIR DECISION AGAIN

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:58.846
IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE -- AND

01:31:58.913 --> 01:31:59.380
ALSO IN RESPONSE TO OTHER

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:01.349
QUESTIONS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:03.184
QUANTITATIVE SO WE WORK WITH THE

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.585
P. YOU SEE TO MAKE SURE THEIR

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:06.087
CONCERN WAS THAT.

01:32:06.153 --> 01:32:07.655
THIS DEFINITION WOULD BE

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:09.590
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PROGRAMS --

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:11.325
SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:12.860
SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND AND

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.462
THAT THE LANGUAGE REFLECTS THAT

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:15.563
THIS CAN BE QUANTITATIVE OR

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:17.765
QUALITATIVE OKAY SO IT'S PRIMARY.

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:20.301
SO I GOT WORD FROM THE CHAIR.

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:21.936
THAT ITS PRIMARY ONE OF THE

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.671
BIGGEST PROGRAMS IS ENERGY

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:25.206
EFFICIENCY CRACK SO THIS WOULD

01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:27.208
MEAN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:28.943
WOULD GO PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:32.246
THE IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GO

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.814
TO FOR EXAMPLE A POOR RURAL

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:35.149
COMMUNITY BECAUSE SINCE YOU'VE

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.918
CHANGED IT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:37.852
SCREEN.

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.553
IF THEY HAVE GOOD AIR THEY DON'T

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.756
QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM.

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:43.724
THAT'S NOT HOW WE INTERPRET THE

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:45.059
BILL SO THE BILL REQUIRES

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:47.528
TRACKING -- AND MEASURING OF NON

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:50.131
ENERGY BENEFITS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:52.099
THE PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:54.035
THAT PROMOTE THOSE BENEFITS IN

01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:55.036
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:56.137
COMMUNITIES WHICH WAS THE

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.672
LANGUAGE WE ORIGINALLY USED --

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:58.873
WHICH GOES BEYOND THE CAL ENVIRO

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:00.508
SCREEN WE'VE ACCEPTED THE

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:02.777
AMENDMENT BUT IT WENT BROADER

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:03.711
JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:06.414
THERE -- WELL I AS I READ THE

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.416
MEN MINUTES SAYS CALLIN VIRUS

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:11.252
SCREEN YES YES AND THEN SO HOW

01:33:11.319 --> 01:33:14.889
DOES HE GO BROADER HOW IT FATED

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:16.357
SERIOUSLY IN.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.025
IT.

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:19.527
I EVEN DID YOU DEVIOUSLY A DEAD

01:33:19.593 --> 01:33:20.995
BUT NOW THAT IT'S CALLUM VIRUS

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:21.896
SCREEN WHAT HOW TO PEOPLE IN

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:23.264
RURAL COMMUNITIES ACCESS IT --

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.098
THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:25.733
ACCESS ALL OF THESE BENEFITS AND

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.901
THEY WOULD ACTUALLY STILL BE

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:28.436
ALLOWED TO MAKE THE NON ENERGY

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:29.937
BENEFIT ARGUMENTS FOR INVESTMENT

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:31.806
IN THEIR COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:33.207
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO RIGHT NOW.

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:34.809
SO THIS DOESN'T DIRECT OR

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:36.711
MANDATE PROJECTS IN THESE

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:38.746
COMMUNITIES AND ALLOWS THE CPUC

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:39.947
TO CONSIDER THAT THESE

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.816
COMMUNITIES ARE UNDERSERVED AND

01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:43.351
OVER POLLUTED WHEN THEY MAKE

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:44.685
THOSE INVESTMENT AND

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:46.854
PROGRAMMATIC EVALUATION DECISION

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.322
YOU BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:50.624
A RURAL COMMUNITY -- ASSEMBLY

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:53.227
MEMBER DOLLY IS ALWAYS SAYING OR

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:55.563
WOOD IS SAYING WE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.264
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE COVERED IN

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:57.965
THIS.

01:33:58.032 --> 01:33:58.933
BY THE HEALTH BY THE

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.438
ENVIRONMENTAL SCREEN BUT WE HAVE

01:34:04.505 --> 01:34:05.606
PLENTY OF POVERTY.

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:07.375
A SO I FIRST UP THERE ARE --

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:07.975
INCOME PROVISIONS IN THE BILL

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:08.476
THAT MIGHT INCLUDE THOSE

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:09.443
COMMUNITIES FOR PRIORITIZATION

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:12.513
WERE CROSSED OUT -- I THINK

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.515
MOVING FORWARD I MEAN AND THAT

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:15.216
THAT IS A QUESTION FOR THE

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:17.418
AUTHOR I KNOW THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:19.286
ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:21.188
THAT THIS.

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:23.357
BILL A IS AS BENEFICIAL AS

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:24.658
POSSIBLE INCLUDING RURAL

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:26.394
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE MEMBERS OF

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.595
REAL COMMUNITIES HERE I HAVE

01:34:27.661 --> 01:34:28.662
BEEN WORKING.

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.698
ON THAT ISSUE SO RESPECTFULLY I

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:31.999
THINK WE'RE COMMITTED TO

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:33.834
CONTINUING TO THINK THROUGH HOW

01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:36.003
TO DO THAT AND WE ACCEPT THAT --

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:38.572
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WENT WITH

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:39.173
A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AT THIS

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.274
TIME.

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.209
THANK YOU IF I COULD JUST ADD TO

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:43.677
THAT -- I APPRECIATE THAT

01:34:43.744 --> 01:34:44.845
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:45.880
HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE SET OF

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:47.515
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT SOME MAY

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:48.682
NOT NECESSARILY BENEFIT FROM THE

01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:50.584
COUNT BY RISK FREE BECAUSE THEY

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:51.185
DON'T HAVE THESE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:52.219
BENEFITS.

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:54.288
BUT I JUST REALLY WANT TO STRESS

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:55.523
THAT IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:57.258
VALLEY WE HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:34:57.324 --> 01:34:59.026
ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:00.494
BOTH THEY ARE VERY LOW INCOME

01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:01.429
THEY ARE.

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.197
AGRICULTURE WORKERS FARM

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:04.865
LABORERS AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY

01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:06.300
HAVE THE WORST AIR QUALITY AND

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:08.169
THE MOST AIR POLLUTION IN THE

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:09.003
STATE BECAUSE THEY'RE CENTERED

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:11.572
AROUND LARGE AG LANDS AND

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:13.307
FARMING PRACTICES THAT DIRECTLY

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:15.042
AFFECT THEIR AIR THEIR WATER.

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:16.410
SO THESE I WOULDN'T I WOULD

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:17.878
STATE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:20.281
EVEN MORE IMPACTED AND THOSE WHO

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:21.849
DO NOT BENEFIT FROM THE CAL ON

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:23.451
BY ROSE SCREEN AT THIS TIME YEAH

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:25.119
I AGREE WITH YOU BUT YOU DID

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:26.420
HAVE PEOPLE FROM.

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:28.289
COMMUNITY SPEAKING HERE WHO

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:31.225
WOULD NOT BE BENEFIT IT DOWN AND

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:31.959
I THINK [inaudible]

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:32.993
WELL.

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:35.062
WILL AGREE TO DISAGREE.

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:36.497
BEFORE THE BEFORE THE CHAIR CUTS

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:38.499
ME OFF JUST ACT THE COMMUNITY IF

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.167

THAT'S THE HIGHEST.

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:52.146
AND I THINK THE INTENTION OF THE

01:35:52.213 --> 01:35:54.682
AUTHOR WAS TO TO ENSURE THAT

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:57.118
THERE WAS A RECOGNITION THAT --

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:58.919
