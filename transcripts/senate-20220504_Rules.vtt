YOUR RESUME AND HOW YOU ACHIEVE

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.612
THE AMERICAN DREAM SOULFUL

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.481
VARIANCE INSPIRATIONAL. AND

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:37.350
CERTAINLY THAT'S BEEN PASSED ON

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:39.185
THROUGH YOUR FAMILY AND I'M SURE

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.853
MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN YOUR

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.721
RESUME AND SENIOR

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.557

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.000
SUCH AN INSPIRATION TO THOSE WHO

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.668
WILL FOLLOW AND I THINK THAT'S

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.536
WHAT WE ALL HOPE TO DO BUT

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:59.739
YOU'RE A KIND OF AT THE TOP OF

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.207

REVISION OF THE K. THROUGH

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:24.297
TWELVE MATH CURRICULUM. AND I

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:25.698
THINK THERE WERE PROBABLY

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:29.068
ALLEGATIONS ACCUSATIONS THAT WE

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.671
WERE DUMBING DOWN OUR MATH

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.273
CURRICULUM AND- OBVIOUS. WHAT

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.107

A YOUNG AGE TO BE INTERESTED IN

00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:00.359
SCIENCE AND MATH AND NOT TO SHY

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.061
AWAY FROM ME ESPECIALLY

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:05.498
NONTRADITIONAL- A POPULATIONS

THAT. KILEY WHAT MOTOR TO GET

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:47.406
INTO MATH AND SCIENCE IN WE NEED

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:49.241
TO THINK. OUR KIDS AT A YOUNGER

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:52.878

REQUIRE. THREE YEARS OF SCIENCE

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:07.226
THAT THEY REQUIRE IT- MASSIVE

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:09.228

AT A YOUNG AGE HE BERMAN GAUGE

00:12:57.543 --> 00:12:59.645
AND ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.413
WITH THEM. TEMPUS SO THAT ONE

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.218
DAY- THE ARE GOING TO COLLEGE

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:08.187
AND HOPEFULLY TO USE SYSTEM. AND

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.689
SO IT'S HOW WE OUT WE OUT WE

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:11.657
KEEPING THEM ENGAGED AND ON

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:14.326

AGREE WITH YOU WE JUST WORKING

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:21.233
FAR HARDER THAN WE DO NOW TO

ENGAGE OUR KIDS AND YOUNGER.

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.038
WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:27.873
ALL. WILL COME ABOUT THOSE WHO

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.208
FALL BEHIND IN THAT. IF WE

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:30.910
REQUIRE SOMETHING HIGHER THAN

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.511
THAT MAKES THEM EVEN MORE.

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:35.247
OUTSIDE THE REALM OF OPPORTUNITY

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:36.982
AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.450
THINK THE SCHOOL HAS A

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:40.152
RESPONSIBILITY. FROM ON THE ONE

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:41.387
IF YOU TAKE THE BELL SHAPED

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:43.289
CURVE WELL WE FROM THEM. ONE

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.057
INTO THE OTHER TO ENSURE THAT

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:46.325
EVERYONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:49.061
HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY. AND

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:50.062
THOSE WHO HAVE PROBABLY HAD A

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.064
DIFFERENT. UPBRINGING ON MAYBE

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:54.166
NOT AS MUCH EXPOSURE WHICH I

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.601
HOPE CERTAINLY THERE ARE.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.303
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BRAND AND OUR

00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:58.370
ABILITIES AND THEY ARE GIVEN

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.306
THAT YOUR- IN THE EARLIER YEARS

00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:02.908
THAT TO SWITCH. OFF FOR STUDENTS

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:04.677
WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH LET'S. OF

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:05.544
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH EIGHTH

00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:08.214
GRADE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.315
NOT BEING. ABLE TO TAKE ALGEBRA

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:11.217
ONE SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:12.184
THROUGH. THE HIGHER OF COURSE

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.086
DECIDE IS WHAT REALLY TROUBLED

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:17.423
MY CONSTITUENT ON PARENTS. SO ON

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:18.724
. YOUR ANSWER ON ABOUT IT SO YOU

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.426
NEED TO KEEP RAISING THE FLAG ON

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:23.095
THAT ONE FOR SURE. BECAUSE I

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:25.698
THINK WE TRY TO COMPENSATE. IN A

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.766
DIFFERENT FASHION FOR THOSE WHO

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.201
HAVE NOT HAD. THE EXPOSURE AND

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.669
THE OPPORTUNITY THERE'S ANOTHER

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:32.071
WAY TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:35.374
RATHER THAN TRYING TO. YOU KNOW

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:38.210
USE THE TERM THAT MY PARENTS AND

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:46.685
WAS IN THE PRESIDENT BEING DOWN. CREASE THE OP. BILLABLE JOBS

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:48.087
NOT OKAY WE'RE GOING YOU KNOW

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:50.389
MAKE YOU MEAN AND THEN OUT NOTE

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:51.290
SAYS YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD AS

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.425
OTHERS WHO CAME TO YOU AND THAT

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:55.127
SORT DOESN'T ALSO FEEL WHICH

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:56.629
HUGE HUGE SELF HUGE IN PEOPLE

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.264
BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVING AN

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.499
EDUCATION ONE LAST QUESTION UP

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.635
ON IS ABOUT THE THAT RATHER

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.104
INCREDIBLY LARGE SALARIES FOR

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.939
PROVIDING OUR COUNSELORS WHEN I

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:09.475
SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE WHO RAN OUR

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:13.112
HIGHER EDUCATION- OINTMENTS ARE

00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:15.648
THERE ARE. TALKING ABOUT. AND

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:17.583
COST FROM AFFORDABILITY SO THAT

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.818
EDUCATION IS THERE FOR EVERYONE.

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:21.220
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE SALARIES

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:23.522
THAT WERE RECENTLY INCREASED AND

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.124
NOW THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. HOW

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.026
MUCH TUITION IS THERE SHOULD BE

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:28.927
AN THE 5% CAP MAYBE BUT THE

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.596
REGION'S HAVE AN ABILITY TO

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:32.231
INCREASE THAT. WHEN YOU INCREASE

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.667
SALARIES THIS MUCH FOR EXAMPLE

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:38.604
UCLA GETTING- FORTY A HUNDRED.

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.439
THOUSAND DOLLARS SENSE THE THIRD

00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:44.109
BASE NOW. YOU KNOW SIX ALMOST

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:45.277
SIX FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.645
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SHOCKING

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:48.113
NUMBERS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT KIDS

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.582
HAVING FOOD IN SECURITY MENTAL

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:54.520
HEALTH ISSUES AW NO HOUSING AND

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:56.221
WE'RE PAYING A ONE INDIVIDUAL

00:15:56.288 --> 00:16:02.094
THAT.BOB I. THE RATION IS A

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:04.530
NIGHT HIGHER HOW WE TRIED TO YOU

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.466
KNOW MEET THIS- PERCENTILE

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:08.200
THOUGHT ON WHEN I WAS THE CITY

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.102

KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:04.022
OPPORTUNITIES THERE BUT BUT BUT-

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:05.757
IF THEY'RE HAVING SO MUCH

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:07.425
TROUBLE YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:10.695
AN OPPORTUNITY THERE FOR FUTURE

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:16.835
EXPAND SO WE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON.

00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:19.337
THE I MADE. MAY WANT TO DO IN

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:21.573
THE FUTURE BUT RIGHT NOW I'M- I

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:22.941
CAN'T CALM ON IT BECAUSE I AM

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:25.010
NOT WITH THE SUBJECT IT IS NOT

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:27.278
BEEN UP TO THE REGION'S ON AN

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:30.482
AGENDA AN AGENDA ITEM. OKAY BUT

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:33.485
YOU KNOW I'D APPRECIATE THAT-

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:37.122
REST. MILLS IS A AT THE BELIEVE

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:40.125
IT SING SAY. GENDER AND BERKELEY

00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:42.660
NOT SO WHEN YOU ASK JUST ADD

00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:44.629
THAT IN THERE ADD THAT LITTLE

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:47.265
COMPLICATED MIX TO IT- BUT THAT

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.167
IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NEED TO

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:53.471
BE WORKED OUT- IN A WAY THAT IS-

00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:55.874
BOTH ETHICAL AND- MAKES SENSE

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.411
FOR THE- COMMUNITY OF STUDENTS

00:27:59.477 --> 00:28:01.112
WHO ARE THERE TO LEARN AND THE

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.781
FOLKS THAT FACULTY WHO ARE THERE

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:05.316
TO TEACH. MY QUESTION ACKERMAN.

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:08.386
REALLY HAS TO DO ACTUALLY WITH-

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:11.322
A RECENT DECISION THAT CAME DOWN

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:13.892
FROM. THE REGIONS AS IT RELATES

00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:16.694
TO- UC MEDICAL CENTERS AND

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:19.597
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS. WE KNOW

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:21.132
THAT- YOU SEE SEVEN

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:23.268
COLLABORATING WITH CATHOLIC

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:25.236
HOSPITALS ON PATIENT CARE FOR

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:27.372
SOME TIME AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:29.007
THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE RATHER

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.875
COMPLICATED- BECAUSE OF

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:34.012
CONFLICTING VALUES I KNOW THAT A

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:35.980
VOTE WAS TAKEN I GUESS IT WAS

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:37.749
LAST YEAR IN JUNE. TO APPROVE

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.484
NEWSSTAND GOVERNING THE UC

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:42.120
AFFILIATIONS WITH THOSE

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:43.254
HOSPITALS- AND OTHERS THAT

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:46.391
IMPOSE. WRIST ON CARE AND SO

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:48.259
JUST WANTED TO KNOW AND THIS HAS

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:49.160
TO DO WITH RELIGIOUS

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:52.730
RESTRICTIONS- AS IT RELATES TO

00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:55.400
MEDICAL DECISIONS. SO HAS THE UC

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.035
DEVELOPED IN THE APPROPRIATE

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:59.871
REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THIS

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:04.209
POLICY IS SOLIDIFIED. HEY IT TO

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:06.578
BE HONEST THE- THE ISSUE HAS NOT

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:09.013
COME TO LIGHT IN TERMS OF IT

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.182
BEING AN ISSUE I THINK- THE WAY

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:13.017
WE'VE BEEN OPERATING HAS BEEN

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.753
FINE AND IT HASN'T COME TO OUR

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.289
ATTENTION THAT THERE IS A

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:18.923
CONTROVERSY OR THAT WHATEVER

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.693
POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IS-

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:25.830
IS NOT THE RIGHT POLICY- AND NOT

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:27.832
. WE KNOW WILL BE- WEIGHT IS

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:32.570
COMING DOWN THE LINE HERE AND

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:33.705
YOU KNOW HOW THAT'S GONNA.

00:29:33.771 --> 00:29:37.542
AFFECT THE- BUT- WITH RESPECT TO

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:40.345
OUR IT BEING ISSUE I SEE BEING

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:42.213
AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW UNLESS YOU'VE

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.015
HEARD OF SOMETHING THAT THE

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:45.884
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.553
CENTERS ARE DOING AT THAT IS

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.855
CONTRADICTORY TO WHAT THE

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:53.725
CURRENT POLICY IS- I THINK

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:54.993
THINGS ARE WORKING THE WAY THEY

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:58.296
SHOULD BE WORKING AND NOW BACK

00:29:58.363 --> 00:29:59.831
TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:03.301
CATHOLIC. CALPERS ODD THAT DONE

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:05.236
LIKE YOU SAID I WAS AN ISSUE

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:07.238
THAT WAS THAT WHAT THEY JULY OR

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:09.407
JUNE AND I CAME ON IN THE FALL

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:11.176
SO AGAIN I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:13.144
THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FOLLOW

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:16.681
UP ON SUBSEQUENT. REGENT

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:19.217
MEETINGS. RIGHT THEY HAVE WAS IN

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:23.588
JUNE AS A- OF SOME ISSUES- THAT.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:27.025
WERE- OBLA MATIC AND THE

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.027
LEGISLATURE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:32.230
PROCESS OF TAKING ACTION- RIGHT

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:35.633
BEFORE- THE REGION'S TOOK THIS A

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.571
VOTE AND SO IT WAS AS A IT WAS

00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:41.039
BECAUSE- THAT YOU SEE DOCTORS

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:42.140
AND LOCAL STUDENTS THAT WERE

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:46.077
PROVIDING CARE. INSIDE CATHOLIC

00:30:46.144 --> 00:30:47.979
HOSPITALS HAD TO ABIDE BY THE

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:50.381
RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THEM BUT

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.649
THE CAPITALS AND IN MANY

00:30:51.716 --> 00:30:53.985
INSTANCES THAT MEANT-

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:55.420
PROHIBITING ABORTIONS OR

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:58.690
STERILIZATIONS OR CONTRACEPTION-

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:01.059
SOME END OF LIFE OPTIONS AND

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:03.361
ALSO GENDER AFFIRMATION SURGERY

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:06.864
SO THE VOTE THAT WAS CARRIED OUT

00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:10.435
IN JUNE. WAS TO- SAY NO TO THAT

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:14.105
BUT SUBSEQUENTLY POLICIES DO

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:16.140
HAVE TO BE IN PLACE TO SOLIDIFY

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:18.476
THAT VOTE THAT WAS TAKEN AND I

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:21.079
THINK IT HAS SOME RELEVANCY NOW.

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:23.414
IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:25.483
AT THE SUPREME COURT SO I'M JUST

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.318

BECAUSE THERE'S A ROCKET AN

ASTRONAUT SUIT WHAT APPEARS TO

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:25.917

YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. AND BOB

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:06.724
WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION THAT

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:08.626
SENATOR BATES ASKED WITH REGARD

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.661
TO THE SALARIES OF CHANCELLOR'S

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:12.296
I KNOW THAT WE TALKED TO THE-

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:14.065
THE PRESIDENT THE UNIVERSITY AND

00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:15.900
HE DID A SIMILAR THING THAT YOU

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.234
JUST DID WHAT SHE CITED THE

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:19.837
SALARY STUDY. AND I PROJECTS

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:22.373
REMINDED HIM THAT THERE WILL BE

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.941
SALARY STUDIES FOR EVERY OTHER

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:25.643
LEVEL AND I HOPE YOU'RE PAYING

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:26.911
ATTENTION TO THE OTHER SALARY

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.779
STUDIES. OF THAT ARE DONE

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:31.082
WITHIN. THE CAMPUS AS WELL THE

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:33.584
PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD. AND I

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:35.620
THINK SENATOR COM LONGER ASKED

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:37.822
ABOUT THE HOSPITAL'S ISSUE. AND

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:39.190
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:41.792
COMPLEX AND THERE'S A CHANCE

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.961
THAT WE MIGHT. MEET WITH YOU AND

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.163
BRING YOU UP TO SPEED BECAUSE IT

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.665
WAS A PROBLEM WITH WHAT WAS

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:50.534
GOING ON AT THE HOSPITALS AND

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:52.169
RICHARD PEREZ- NEGOTIATED A

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:53.437
SOLUTION THAT THE REGENTS

00:37:53.504 --> 00:37:55.473
ADOPTED IN LIEU OF A BILL THAT

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:58.409
THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK IT

00:37:58.476 --> 00:37:59.410
WOULD BE GOOD TO JUST. MAKE IT

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:02.146
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T COME ON AFTER

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:03.514
SOME OF THAT HAPPENED AND IT

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:05.249
WOULD BE GOOD TO MAKE SURE.%

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:07.318
YOU'RE UP TO SPEED. A. N. ON

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:09.920
MILLS COLLEGE I THINK MANY OF US

00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:11.555
IN PARTICULAR ON THE EDUCATION

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.224
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. WE'RE

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.892
LOOKING AT EXACTLY THE PROBLEM

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.460
THAT SENATOR CALM WATER

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:17.962
REFERENCED WITH REGARD TO

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:22.433
ENROLLMENT. BAND THE- AND WE END

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.868
OUR CONVERSATION TALKED ABOUT

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:25.469
THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:27.204
CALIFORNIA HAS JUST BEEN JAMMING

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.606
EVERY EXTRA STUDENT INTO THE

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.374
EXISTING FORTY PRINT DINNER

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:33.511
NEEDS TO BE A LONG TERM PLAN AND

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:36.247
ONE OF THE PLANS WAS IF MILLS ON

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:38.416
ITS OWN ON THE DECISION OF MILLS

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:41.419
COLLEGE DECIDED TO GO OUT OF

RECORDING ENTER AND CAPACITY FOR

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:51.095
MOMENT AND I THINK THAT'S- R.

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.163
WHERE THAT STOOD. AND GIVEN THE

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:54.865
FACT EVERYBODY ASKED EVERYTHING

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:56.600
. I THINK I WOULD JUST DO A

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.803
DIFFERENT TERM. ON YOUR

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:01.105

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:37.120
CALL. THAT WAS GOAL AND YOU KNOW

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:38.922
YOU DIDN'T OUT FOR YOU. TO GO TO

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.156
TRADE SCHOOL AND MAYBE THAT

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:42.358
WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A BAD IDEA

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:43.326
ABOUT TIME ANYWAY. I KNOW

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.028
ELEKTRISCHE AND WAS MAKING TWICE

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:46.696
AS MUCH AS FRIEND OF MINE WHO'D

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:47.263
GONE AND GOTTEN HIS MASTER'S

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:49.232
DEGREE SO. IF IF THE DIFFERENT

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.734
TIME HOWEVER AND I WAS CONCERNED

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.536
ABOUT. THE ELIMINATION OF THE

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:58.541
FAT AND ASKED FOR ADMISSIONS-

00:57:58.608 --> 00:58:00.210
WONDERING. YOU ASSESS IT.

00:58:00.276 --> 00:58:01.911
STUDENTS AND THEY'RE READYNAS

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:03.546
LET'S TALK ABOUT MATURITY AND

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:05.982
READY ENOUGH. FOR YOU KNOW

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:07.884
JUMPING FROM HIGH SCHOOL INTO.

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:09.786
WHAT'S REALLY VERY DEMANDING

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:11.654
SCHEDULE IN YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR.

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.523
AND I THINK THE MOST

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:15.425
DEMORALIZING THING THAT CAN

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:18.228
HAPPEN TO. FIRST YEAR OF STUDENT

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:20.063
IN COLLEGE IS THEY DON'T MAKE IT

00:58:20.129 --> 00:58:22.465
AND THAT HAPPENED TO A FEW OF- I

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:23.566
WOULDN'T SAY FRIENDS BUT

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:25.568
COLLEAGUES WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:26.169
THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH

00:58:26.236 --> 00:58:27.470
THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR THEY JUST

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:29.205
THEY JUST THEY WE WERE TAKING

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:31.107
THE SAT AT THAT TIME BUT- NOT TO

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.775
DEBATE THAT JUST. GIVE ME YOUR

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.077
THOUGHTS ON THAT AND HOW YOU DO

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:36.379
A SELF AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:37.780
STUDENTS THAT MAYBE NEED THAT

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:41.684
AFTER SUPPORT. WHAT IS ART WHAT

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:43.553
ARE OUR- UNIVERSITIES PROVIDING

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.088
AND ARE THEY PROVIDING SOMETHING

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.723
SO THAT THEY CAN CATCH THOSE

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:47.924
LIKE THE SAFETY NET I GUESS IS

00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:49.092
WHAT I'M TALKING. BECAUSE I

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:50.560
WOULD HOPE. THAT THAT THERE'S

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:53.229
SOME PLANNING AND OUT TO ENSURE

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:55.899
THAT. SOMEONE DOESN'T YOU KNOW

00:58:55.965 --> 00:58:58.134
DROP OUT- FILTERS THEME AGAIN IS

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.403
FULL SO VERY IMPORTANT IN THAT

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.171
AGE RANGE SO. WELL AND THAT

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:03.339

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:07.076
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. THANK YOU

THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR THE

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:18.187
QUESTION IS A GREAT QUESTION AND

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:21.491
I'M PORTANT QUESTIONS- I THINK

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:24.427
IT'S A G. F. AS A TEASE- HAVE

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.629
BEEN A PART OF A- COLLEGE

00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:28.331
ADMISSIONS AND QUESTIONS FOR SO

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:31.100
LONG I AND- BUT THE FACT OF THE

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:33.036
MATTER IS WE LEARNED THAT THE S.

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:38.241
A. T. SENATE ISSUE. S. AND THE.

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:41.711
A. C. T. IT'S- REALLY A SENSE

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:44.147
THAT BEING. AS GOOD PREDICTORS

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:47.283
OF COLLEGE SUCCESS AS THEY ONCE

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:49.352
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THEY WERE

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:51.487
NOT THE LEVELLERS IF YOU WILL.

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:52.722
OF THE MERIT LEVELERS OF THEY

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:55.858
WERE UP HOW DID TO BE. AND IN

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:58.361
FACT WHAT HAPPENED- OVER TIME IS

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.696
THAT CERTAIN GROUPS IN

00:59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.764
PARTICULAR GROUPS FROM A LOWER

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:04.033
INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED GROUPS.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.969
WERE REALLY ARE NOT DOING THAT

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:11.140
WELL AND IN A SENSE EXACERBATING. INEQUITIES IN COLLEGES AND-

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:13.443
THE BEST PREDICTOR OF HOW STUPID

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:15.945
WILL DO IN COLLEGE REALLY IS FOR

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:19.415
HIGH SCHOOL- RECORD FOR HIGH

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:20.483
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS AND HOW THEY

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.353
DO. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:25.922
WITH THE CSU AS YOU KNOW WE DID

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.292
A WOMAN LIKE THE SAT AND- IN THE

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:32.829
A. C. T. I. IT ALONE IT. WILL AT

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:36.833
THE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL- DATA

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:39.602
TRANSFERS THE THREE G. COMPLETE

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.537
COMPLETIONS AND THEN TO YOUR

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:42.672
POINT THERE IS THE ADMISSION

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:44.240
PROCESS FROM THEN THE PLACEMENT

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:48.177
PROCESS HOW. HOW DOES THE SCHOOL

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:50.013
NO. WHERE THAT STUDENT WIDELY BE

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.681
BEST PLACE FOR THEY REALLY

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.750
SHOULD SO THEY DON'T. SO THE

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.586
THEY DON'T OF. FIND THEMSELVES

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:58.121
AGAINST THE OBSTACLES OF EITHER

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.256
MATH OR ENGLISH WHICH OF THE

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:03.292
TWO- SORT OF GATEWAY COURSES. OF

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:06.262
THE UNIVERSITY HAS MULTIPLE WAYS

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:09.065
OF ASSESSING THAT. ARE SOME OF

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:10.366
THEM ARE STILL STANDARDIZED TEST

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:11.601
OF THE STUDENT TAKES A

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.102
STANDARDIZED TEST THE GOVERNMENT

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.038
OR USE THAT. BUT IF YOU WERE TO

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:17.273
GO TO THEIR WEBSITE YOU WILL SEE

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.441
THAT THERE'S A WHOLE SYSTEM

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.476
THERE THAT ENTERING STUDENTS CAN

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:22.712
USE TO ASSESS AND TO SORT OF SEE

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:25.648
WHERE THE PLACE. AND THEN BASED

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.350
ON THE SELF ASSESSMENT THEY CAN

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:28.651
THINK AND TALK TO THEIR GUIDANCE

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:31.020
COUNSELORS AND THEN THEY HAVE A

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:33.189
WHOLE BUNCH OF ARCHED OF SCORING

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.758
THE CLASSES WITH. WERE STRONG

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.360
COLLEGE IN THE SUMMER BEFORE OR

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:40.329
DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES THIS.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:41.998
THE MAIN OF WITH THE KERN WITH

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:52.508
THE- IS DOING IS.

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:55.378
THEY SPEND THE MOST LASSEN. SO

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:59.749
YEAH OUR- THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:02.885
YES I THINK THAT ONE OF THE

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.587
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS A

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:07.423
SYSTEM IS BE PREPARED TO ASSIST

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.292
THOSE STUDENTS- FOR THEIR

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.294
PLACEMENT AND THAT'S EXACTLY

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.029
WHAT WE'VE DONE- PART OF THE

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:16.099
MULTI FACTOR MISTER PROCESS- IS

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:18.835
TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW BASED ON

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.970
THEIR FORCES LIKE- ADDRESSING OF

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:24.373
THE SAID BASED ON THEIR GPA-

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.209
THAT IF THEY NEED TO ENROLL IN

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.877
WHAT'S CALLED AN EARLY START

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:30.012
PROGRAM THEY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:32.148
THAT PROGRAM IN THE SUMMER.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.050
PRIOR TO THEM ATTENDING IN THE

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:37.553
FALL AND ALL OF OUR TWENTY THREE

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.754
CAMPUSES ACTUALLY OFFER THAT

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.323
EARLY START PROGRAM AND IT WAS

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:41.924
DESIGNED TO DEVELOP COLLEGE

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.593
RIGHT READY MISS BEFORE THEY

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.128
ENROLL IN SCHOOL WHICH I THINK

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:48.297
IS CRUCIAL- I FEEL YOU KNOW MY

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:50.900
STORY BEING FROM A RURAL

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.502
COMMUNITY AND ON A SMALLER

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:56.305
SCHOOL THAT THE NECESSARY.

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:59.242
RESOURCES I WHAT- INFORMED OR

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:01.544
PREPARED EVEN SHARED WHEN THE-

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.246
OR ACT DEAD WORST I DIDN'T GET

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.648
TO TAKE THAT. THEM THROUGH THE

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:08.818
WAS MY STORY AND I KNOW THAT

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.753
MANY- STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.988
A PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:14.790
EXPERIENCE THAT. SO AS A SYSTEM

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.459
WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.728
WE HAVE THOSE IN PLACE SO THAT

01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:22.532
THE STUDENTS ARE JUST READY TO

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:24.066
GO WHEN THEY START IN THE FALL.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.868
WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT NOW TO

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:27.203
THE QUESTION ON BOTH OF YOU

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.405
CONFIDANTE WHEN I SAW IT IT WAS

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.607
TROUBLING ON JUST KNOWING A FEW

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:32.942
RELATE TO KIDS GOING INTO

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.144
KINDERGARTEN SOMETIMES THEY'RE

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:37.914
JUST NOT READY RIGHT. AND ON

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.649
THAT SAME THING AS WE MATURE

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:41.617
ALONG THE WAY FROM SOME ARE VERY

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:43.119
SMART BUT MAYBE NOT READY FOR

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.987
THE PRESSURES THAT COME. IT

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.856
SOUNDS LIKE YOU DO HAVE. AN

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.424
ATTENTION TO THAT AND CERTAINLY

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.193
ARE WITHOUT EARLY START I WOULD

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:51.827
SAY THAT FOR. MAYBE A SAFETY

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:55.031
NET. THAT FOR THEIR FIRST BEFORE

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.732
SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT YOU KNOW HAVE

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.968
HAVE AN ISSUE ONCE THEY'RE THERE

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.670
I JUST ONE LAST QUESTION I KNOW-

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:03.272
ON. THEIR ON THE IMPROVING THE

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.840
GRADUATION RATES FOR FRESHMEN

BEEN AN INITIATIVE IN THE FOLK

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.845
OF. THAT MY STAFF INFORMATION

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:12.248

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:14.083
THE BUDGET WITH ACTION RATES FOR

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:15.284
LOW INCOME. AND UNDERREPRESENTED

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:15.918
STUDENTS THOUGHT YOU'VE

DETERMINE WHAT. WITH CUTTING OUT

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:26.028
WHAT THE GAP IS THAT MIGHT GO TO

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:28.564

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:30.132
SCHOOL TO COME OUT OF WHAT-

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.068
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE KIND. OF IN

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.937
THERE THEY HAD THE IN DEPTH- IN

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:37.139
IN ENGLISH OR- MATH THIRTY

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.441
NEEDED BUT- HERE'S YOUR THOUGHTS

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:41.077
ON THAT- TRUSTEE RODRIGUEZ ONE

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:44.347
OF YOU A- SOFTENED WILL GO BACK

PEOPLE I START. ON SEVEN EIGHT

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:02.198
MONTHS AGO- IS- SEES FIVE POINT

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.433
- EQUITY. ON REALLY MAKING SURE

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.303
THAT. THERE PRACTICES SUPPORTS A

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.038
RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS THAT NEED

CAN HELP THEM GRADUATE. ON TIME.

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:16.379
AND AND I THINK THOSE ARE

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:17.913
IMPORTANT YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.448

ON THE RULES COMMITTEE AND I

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:08.397
THINK EXPANDING ON WHAT SENATOR

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:10.632
GROVE SAID. IT'S INTERESTING TO

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:13.201

CANDIDATES OR FROM AN IMMIGRANT

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:18.040

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:22.945
I THINK THAT'S NOT SOMETHING.

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:24.746

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.825
DETAILED TALK CURRENT EVENTS AT

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:45.600
THINK THAT. THAT WHETHER IT IS

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:47.135
OF THE CURRENT EVENTS IN

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:50.005
CHOOSING A NEW CHANCELLOR. OR

THE OPERATIONS AND THE LABOR

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.508
AGREEMENTS MAKING SURE THAT

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:54.810
SOMEBODY IS LOOKING OVER THE

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.979
ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THE

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:58.113
LABOR AGREEMENTS ARE DONE IN A

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.849
WAY. THAT IS FAIR AND WORKS FOR

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:03.251
PEOPLE OR THE GRADUATION RATES

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:05.487
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A PROGRAM

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:06.088
THAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:08.890
SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THE FOUR

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.592
YEAR GRADUATION RATE BUT IT'S

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.794
NOT THERE YET. TO WEAR THE GOALS

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:15.364

VERY VERY. GREAT DISCUSSION WE

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:11.219
MET. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:14.122
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:17.926
UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOARD IS THE

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:20.228
GOVERNING BODY. HE HAS A

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:24.366
RESPONSIBILITY TO REALLY ASK.

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:28.603
CRITICAL QUESTIONS. INTO ISSUES

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:31.873
TO ENSURE THE WHEN PROPOSALS

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.409
COME TO THE STAFF WE ACTUALLY

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:37.012
ARE NOT ESSENTIALLY EXPECTED TO

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:39.147
APPROVE BUT THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:41.283
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUES ARE

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:43.618
WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE WHAT THE

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:46.354
PROS AND THE CONS ARE. SO ONE OF

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:48.590
THE THINGS I WOULD SAY RIGHT OFF

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.125
THE BAT AND TERMS OF HOW THE

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:53.528
BOARD OPERATES- AND PERHAPS FOR

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:56.598
THE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.200
THE COMMITTEES AND THE BOARD

01:18:58.266 --> 01:19:00.669
STRUCTURES ON THE SOFA AND THE

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:05.140
OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY DIG INTO

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:06.641
THOSE BIG ISSUES THAT AFFECT.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.243
THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS A

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.145
GOOD EXAMPLE WE'VE GOTTEN

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:12.280
REPORTS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:14.416
TO TALK. BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:16.551
I SUSPECT THAT WE CAN HAVE IN

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:19.287
TERMS OF HEARINGS OR- COMMITTEE

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:22.390
MEETINGS. WITH THE STAFF THERE

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:25.460
REALLY PRO AND UNDERSTAND AND

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:28.630
THEN SUGGEST HOW WE WOULD EXPECT

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:32.734
TO SEE OR DON'T KNOW ESSENTIALLY

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:35.170
. IMAGE WITH NONE THE BELTWAY IN

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:38.773
A GOOD WAY. HOW CAN WE DO BETTER

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.642
AND HOW CAN WE HELP THEM GET

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.811
BETTER- AT THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:46.114
LEVEL- THE LABOR AGREEMENTS FOR

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:47.415
EXAMPLE OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:49.384
NEGOTIATED. BUT I THINK AT THE

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.919
BOARD LEVEL AND THIS IS

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.154
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT HAS

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.422
COME UP BEFORE. WE WANT TO MAKE

01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:57.192
SURE THAT WE HAVE GOING FAIR

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:59.294
LABOR AGREEMENT SO THAT THEY ARE

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:01.830
IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATELY. END

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:03.265
TO THE EARLIER DISCUSSION WITH

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:05.133
YOU SEE ABOUT SALARIES THAT THE

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.469
SALARIES ARE ALL ACROSS ALL THE

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:09.404
WAY DOWN UP AND DOWN THE LINE.

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:11.206
YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING WE

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.440
CERTAINLY HAVE OUR EXECUTIVE

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:14.209
COMPENSATION ISSUE THAT WE'RE

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:16.278
GONNA BE TAKING UP. BUT WE ALSO

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.380
HAVE A SALARY STUDY FOR STAFF

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:20.982
AND A SALARY STUDY FOR FACULTY

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:22.551
WE WANT TO BRING SOME EQUITY

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.452
ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND THAT IS

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:28.323
SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD HAS

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.891
BEEN VERY CONSISTENT. IT'S NOT

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:30.592
JUST. THE PRESIDENT'S. OR THE

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.328
FACULTY OR THE STAFF WE SAID NO

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:35.130
WE HAVE TO GET IT ALL DONE WE

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:37.265
HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE AND

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:38.466
THAT IS A PLACE FOR THE BOARD

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:40.468
REALLY ASSERTED ITSELF. WE WANT

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:43.071
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE-

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.340
EQUITY IF YOU WILL OPEN DOWN THE

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:50.745
INSTITUTIONS- CHOOSING THE

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.747
CHANCELLOR PERHAPS IS THE MOST.

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:55.917
IMPORTANT JOB OF THE BOARD HAS

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:58.553
OUR LOOK THE FREELANCE. I THINK

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.457
THAT THE- THE- THERE BEEN SOME

THAT'S FIXED TERM IMPORTANT. THE

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:46.514
CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS THE

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:47.648

ACTUALLY. IS HAS IS VERY

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:04.165
CONSCIOUS OF THIS WORKING VERY

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.768
HARD. ON SEVERAL LEVELS IN TERMS

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:08.603
OF RECRUITING NATIONALLY USING

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:10.471
ALL THE NETWORKS THEY CAN MAKING

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:12.140
SURE THAT THEY USE BEST

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:14.375
PRACTICES. BEING AWARE OF

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:16.644
UNCONSCIOUS BIASES WITH FEDERAL

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.479
TO RECRUIT AND REALLY BRING IN A

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:20.114
DIVERSE POOL OF EXISTING

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:23.618
CANNABIS. BUT ALSO DEVELOPING

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:27.155
PIPELINES WE DON'T HAVE THE PHD

01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:29.624
PROGRAMS THOSE IN THE UC AND

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:33.394

01:46:03.824 --> 01:46:05.926
PRIORITIES IN THE FIRST ON A

01:46:05.992 --> 01:46:07.761
CENTERING THE MASTER PLAN FOR

01:46:07.828 --> 01:46:09.162
AGING IN ADDRESSING THE HOUSING

JUST DID. IT AND IT'S A MORE OF.

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:19.773
TWO QUESTIONS ONE WE CONFIRMED

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.874
THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF

01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:25.746
AGING WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW. THE

01:46:25.812 --> 01:46:28.148
MASTER PLAN WAS ACTUALLY GOING

TO TRANSLATE INTO ACTION HOW IS

01:46:31.084 --> 01:46:32.586
IT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TAKEN

01:46:32.652 --> 01:46:33.653
BECAUSE THE FIRST THING WE DID

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:36.056
LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET IS TO

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:36.590
CREATE POSITIONS FOR

01:46:36.656 --> 01:46:38.058
IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT THE

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:39.693
IMPLEMENTATION IS STILL OUT

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.128
THERE AND I THINK SENATOR GROVE

01:46:41.194 --> 01:46:43.897

ARE IN FACT IMPLEMENTED OUT OF

01:46:51.271 --> 01:46:54.741
THE MASTER PLAN FROM YOUR LEVEL

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:55.709
HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT

01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:56.810
HAPPENS. THANK YOU SENATOR

QUESTION AND- AS I MENTIONED- I

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:02.382
WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THE

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:04.317
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND I DON'T

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:06.086
KNOW IF YOU WERE ABLE TO ATTEND

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:07.287
ANY OF THOSE STAKEHOLDER

01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:09.055
MEETINGS BUT- ACTION WAS REALLY

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:11.024
THE WORD OF THE DAY RIGHT NOBODY

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:13.727
WANTED TO REPORT. OR A MASTER

01:47:13.794 --> 01:47:15.595
PLAN THAT SAT ON THE SHELF.

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:18.198
THERE WAS A REAL ENERGY. AND A

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:20.267
SENSE OF URGENCY THAT THE MASTER

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:24.871
PLAN FOR AGING BE A CONCRETE-

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:27.207
JUBAL PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA AND I

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:30.610

01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:33.146
STAKEHOLDERS. A LOT OF REPORTS

01:47:33.213 --> 01:47:34.581
AND THEN THE PLAN THAT THE

01:47:34.648 --> 01:47:36.416
GOVERNOR PUT IN PLACE IN JANUARY

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:38.351
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IS TRULY AN

01:47:38.418 --> 01:47:40.520
ACTUAL PLAN AND I THINK THAT

01:47:40.587 --> 01:47:42.489
REALLY STARTS WITH OUR FIVE FOLD

01:47:42.556 --> 01:47:45.392
GOALS. AND REALLY HONING IN ON

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:47.561
WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THOSE

01:47:47.627 --> 01:47:49.863
REALITY SO AGAIN I'LL USE

01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:51.331
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS UNDER

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:54.234
CSS AS AN EXAMPLE. I MENTIONED-

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:58.305
I AGES AS A SHIP WHICH IS

01:47:58.371 --> 01:47:58.872
GETTING OFF THE GROUND. BUT

01:47:58.939 --> 01:48:00.040
THERE ARE MANY INITIATIVES WHICH

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:01.875
ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ALREADY

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:04.477
HELPING CALIFORNIANS- IN MANY

01:48:04.544 --> 01:48:07.113

PROGRAM. THAT PROGRAM'S BEEN IN

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:12.252
EXISTENCE FOR A FEW YEARS NOW

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:13.954
BUT WHAT WE NOW HAVE THE

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:17.157
OPPORTUNITY TO DO AND I THINK IN

01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:18.592
LARGE PART BECAUSE- OF THE

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:19.492
PRESSURE. PRESSURE FROM THE

01:48:19.559 --> 01:48:21.461
MASTER PLAN AND THE REAL

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:23.196
COMMITMENT TO IT BY BOTH THE

01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:25.131
GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION

01:48:25.198 --> 01:48:26.733
BUT ALSO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.668
PROGRAM RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT

01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:30.770
ADDITIONAL MONEY. TO HELP US

FINE HERMIT HOUSING. BUT NOW

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:46.286
WITH THE EXPANDED FUNDS THAT WE

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:47.621
RECEIVED AND THE ADDITIONAL

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:49.723
YEARS TO WORK ON THAT. WE ARE

01:48:49.789 --> 01:48:51.758

HELP CLOSER TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:55.061

ACTUALLY FALLEN INTO

01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:06.606

ON THE STREETS BUT WE ALSO HAVE

01:49:26.293 --> 01:49:28.028
TO CLOSE THE DOOR HOME. I THINK

01:49:28.094 --> 01:49:29.896
WHAT THE DEPARTMENT AND LARGE

01:49:29.963 --> 01:49:30.864
AGENCY AND THE ADMINISTRATION

01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:32.666
MORE GENERALLY IS TRYING TO DO

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:34.200
IS TO TAKE A MULTI PRONGED

THINK ABOUT THE PROACTIVE

01:49:39.205 --> 01:49:40.674
STRATEGIES WE CAN TAKE TO CLOSE

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.710
THE FRONT DOOR. SO I THINK YOU

01:49:43.777 --> 01:49:45.412
KNOW THERE'S THE- AGE PROGRAM

01:49:45.478 --> 01:49:50.517
WHICH IS. ALSO HOUSE.

01:49:50.583 --> 01:49:51.618
UNCONNECTED IN. A PROTECT

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:52.953
SERVICES THAT ALREADY BY BUT

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.921
ALSO WAS. SIGNIFICAN ADDITIONAL

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:56.957
FUNDS. BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:59.759
HAVE NOW EXPANDED INTO. A ONE

01:49:59.826 --> 01:50:01.861
INCH OF FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES AND

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:04.364
TO TRIBAL ENTITIES AND THE OTHER

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:04.998
ONE TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:07.767
WITHOUT. ALMOST COMPLETELY

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:08.668
COVERING THE WHOLE STATE WITH

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:10.570
THOSE PROGRAMS. AND THEN AS WE

01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:12.806
ROLL OUT OUR COMMUNITY CARE

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:14.941
EXPANSION PROGRAM. GOING TO AS I

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:16.076
MENTIONED BUILD CAPACITY WITHIN

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:17.711
OUR SYSTEM WHICH IS NEW FOR US

01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:19.980
AND I THINK AGAIN IT'S GOING TO

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.414
BE A REAL TANGIBLE RESULTS. AT

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:22.816
THE END OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.150
WILL HAVE PHYSICALLY MORE

01:50:24.217 --> 01:50:26.186
LICENSE FACILITIES FOR OLDER

01:50:26.252 --> 01:50:28.421
ADULTS TO LIVE SAFELY AND SO I

01:50:28.488 --> 01:50:30.857
THINK. HOW I SEE THE MASTER PLAN

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:32.225
IS A LIVING DOCUMENT AS A

01:50:32.292 --> 01:50:34.194
FRAMEWORK WE'RE GOING TO FIND

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.129
NEW SOLUTIONS NEW IDEAS NEW

01:50:36.196 --> 01:50:38.164
PROBLEMS WILL EMERGE AND WE'RE

01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:39.632
GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE THE

01:50:39.699 --> 01:50:41.801
PRINCIPLES AND THE GOALS OF THE

01:50:41.868 --> 01:50:45.805
MASTER PLAN TO DRIVE US. TOWARD

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:46.773
CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. WELL MY

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.641
PRECIADO SAID I THINK. THE

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:51.044
CHALLENGES A NEW RACE TO

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:53.880
QUESTION AND SORT OF YOUR ANSWER

01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:57.150
THE CHALLENGES. IS MAKING SURE

01:50:57.217 --> 01:50:59.786
THAT. IT'S NOT JUST HAVING GOALS

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:02.155
AND- ACHIEVING NUMBERS IT'S

01:51:02.222 --> 01:51:03.590
WORKING ON THE GROUND TO MAKE

01:51:03.656 --> 01:51:05.058
SURE IT'S REALLY IMPACTING

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:07.127
CHANGE IN IT IT'S LIKE I KNOW

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:08.661
BEING ANSWER. HAVING BEEN IN

01:51:08.728 --> 01:51:10.597
CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:14.134
MY QUESTION IS ALWAYS. ARE WE

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.802
GOING TO GET TO THE END AND HOW

01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:17.270
ARE PEOPLE GOING TO REALLY FEEL

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:18.805
THE HIM. FROM WHAT IT IS WORTH

01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:21.007
IT AND I THINK. THAT HAS TO BE

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:22.409
THE UNDERLYING QUESTION AND- AND

01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:26.112
WHEN YOU WENT INTO HOMELESSNESS.

01:51:26.179 --> 01:51:28.081
THAT'S AN ISSUE. THAT'S WHERE

01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:29.516
YOU RAISED THE NEXT QUESTION

01:51:29.582 --> 01:51:33.920
BECAUSE I THINK THAT ARE HIDDEN

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:36.156
MY DISTRICT. IT IS JUST OFF THE

01:51:36.222 --> 01:51:37.657
CHARTS AND WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:39.092
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING OBVIOUSLY

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:40.493
WERE IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:43.129
THAT'S- THAT'S TRUE TOO AND I

01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:45.932
KNOW MAYBE YOU HALF. OUR OUR ONE

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:48.435
SUBSET OF D. DEALING WITH AGING

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:52.105
AND- WITH THAT PART. THE REAL

01:51:52.172 --> 01:51:54.240
CHALLENGE IS MAKE IT TO THAT OP

01:51:54.307 --> 01:51:57.777
DE. IS MAKING SURE WHAT COMES

01:51:57.844 --> 01:51:59.879
FROM SACRAMENTO SUPPORTS WHAT'S

01:51:59.946 --> 01:52:01.548
WORKING ON THE GROUND AND

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:02.749
SOMETIMES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:05.251
SACRAMENTAL. THERE IS A

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:06.953
DISCONNECT AND I THINK PEOPLE

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.621
WOULD. IN THIS AND OTHER

01:52:08.688 --> 01:52:10.523
COMMITTEES ARE PROBABLY GETTING

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:13.059
TIRED OF ME TALKING ABOUT. THAT

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:15.929
THE PARK HOMELESS IN MY HOME

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.831
TOWN IS BIGGER ON A PER CAPITA

01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:20.300
BASIS SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:22.302
AND SAN DIEGO AND OAKLAND. BUT

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:23.903
THE MONEY COMES ON A PER CAPITA

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:26.873
BASIS SO IT NEVER ALLOWS THEM TO

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.408
GET AHEAD. MARCUSE A PER CAPITA

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:30.343
BASIS ON THE GENERAL POPULATION

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:31.111
THAT NUMBER ALLOWS THEM TO GET

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:33.813
AHEAD. OF WHAT THE ISSUE IS TO

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.515
HAVE SUCH A DISPROPORTIONATE

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:37.217
IMPACT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:38.651
THERE'S CERTAIN PLACES WHERE

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:40.820
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DONE. THAT

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:42.689
REALLY WORK AND THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:52:42.755 --> 01:52:45.158
STEPPING UP AND DOING THINGS TO

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:46.826
GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND

01:52:46.893 --> 01:52:50.230
WAS SERVICES AND YET AT THE SAME

01:52:50.296 --> 01:52:50.897
TIME. THE MONEY COMES IN CERTAIN

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:53.800
PARTS IT DOESN'T COME. FROM HERE

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:56.736
AUTOMATICALLY OR AND ARE EASILY

01:52:56.803 --> 01:52:59.005
READILY EASIER WE WAY. TO GET TO

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:00.507
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THAT

01:53:00.573 --> 01:53:02.775
ON THE GROUND THAT SO THAT'S

01:53:02.842 --> 01:53:04.844
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. IN A

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:07.247
QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE

01:53:07.313 --> 01:53:10.316
DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS THE FACT

01:53:10.383 --> 01:53:11.684
THAT YOU SORT OF RECOGNIZE. TO

01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:13.086
THE OUT. SURE EVERYTHING IS

01:53:13.153 --> 01:53:14.587
GUIDE TO THE OUTCOMES I THINK

01:53:14.654 --> 01:53:15.822
THAT'S REALLY TRUE WITH

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:17.924
HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AND AFTER

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:21.327
MY WILL RIFF OR RENT- GIVE YOU A

01:53:21.394 --> 01:53:23.163
CHANCE TO MAYBE TALK ABOUT THAT

BEFORE WE MOVE THANK YOU I'M

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:27.100
GLAD YOU- YOU YOU PROVIDE ME A

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:28.301
LITTLE MORE CHANCE TO ANSWER

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:29.669
BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS I REALLY

01:53:29.736 --> 01:53:32.205
WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR IS

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.206
HOW COMMITTED THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:34.641
AND HOW COMMITTED I AM. TO

01:53:34.707 --> 01:53:36.242
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND

01:53:36.309 --> 01:53:38.211

TO DO THOUGHTFULLY- AROUND

01:54:26.526 --> 01:54:28.595
HOMELESSNESS IS. THE THOUGHTFUL

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:30.663
IN OUR ALLOCATIONS. AND TRYING

01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:33.066
TO MAKE THE MONEY FLOW AS-

01:54:33.132 --> 01:54:35.902
SEAMLESSLY AND SIMPLY AS WE CAN

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:37.737
WALL. PROTECTING GOVERNMENT

01:54:39.606 --> 01:54:42.275
MONEY IS GOING WHO NEEDS IT. SO

01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:43.610
FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE WORKING

FACILITIES. THAT MONEY IS GOING

01:54:57.090 --> 01:54:59.459
TO GO THROUGH COUNTIES. BUT ONE

01:54:59.525 --> 01:55:00.326
OF THE THINGS WE'RE REALLY

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:02.028
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT IS WHEN WE

01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:03.296
ALLOCATE THAT MONEY REALLY NOT

01:55:03.363 --> 01:55:04.964

COUNTY YOU GET THE MOST MONEY

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:08.935

REALLY TRYING TO TAKE A

01:55:18.911 --> 01:55:20.813
THOUGHTFUL LOOK AT THE FACTORS

ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WERE

CANNOT SOURCE THAT. BECAUSE IT'S

02:08:16.155 --> 02:08:27.433
NOT. BUILT.

02:08:27.499 --> 02:08:28.634
TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL

02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:30.436

HOPING RIGHT NOW ARE EARLY

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:40.512
ESTIMATES WERE HOPING TO HAVE AS

02:08:40.579 --> 02:08:42.848
MANY AS FOUR THOUSAND NEW GUIDES

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:44.283
THAT ARE SERVING AS A SITE

02:08:44.349 --> 02:08:46.385
RECIPIENTS AND PART OF GETTING

02:08:46.452 --> 02:08:49.455
THAT MONEY. IS MAKING. A

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:52.157
COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO ALL

02:08:52.224 --> 02:08:53.392
THOSE BAGS TO SSI RECIPIENTS SO

02:08:53.459 --> 02:08:55.928

02:08:55.994 --> 02:08:58.197
MORE GUARANTEED CAPACITY WITHIN

02:08:58.263 --> 02:09:01.200
OUR CITY- BUT SOME OF THAT MONEY

02:09:01.266 --> 02:09:03.669
IS ALSO GOING TO PRESERVING

02:09:03.735 --> 02:09:06.004

02:09:06.071 --> 02:09:07.272
FAMILIAR WITH THE FIFTY FIVE

02:09:07.339 --> 02:09:08.407
MILLION THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS

02:09:08.474 --> 02:09:11.043
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:11.510

WHAT A UNIQUE PROGRAM IT IS

02:10:40.098 --> 02:10:41.300
NATIONWIDE- IT REALLY ALLOWS

02:10:41.366 --> 02:10:43.101
MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

SAFELY IN THEIR OWN HOMES AND

02:10:49.575 --> 02:10:51.543
HIGHER. THEIR OWN PROVIDERS. SO

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:53.979
IT'S REALLY- IT'S REALLY

02:10:54.046 --> 02:10:56.248
ENABLING BOTH- YOU KNOW

SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT IT ON THERE

02:11:10.028 --> 02:11:10.896
ARE CHALLENGES TO THE PROGRAM I

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:13.065
THINK. THE THREE BIGGEST I WOULD

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:15.767
SAY IS NUMBER ONE RETAINING AND

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:18.537
RECRUITING WORKFORCE. I'M YOU

02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:20.072

02:11:20.138 --> 02:11:22.074
PROBABLY COME UP IN EVERY

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:23.342
CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERY TOPIC

02:11:23.408 --> 02:11:25.911
YOU KNOW WE JUST ARE IN A PLACE

02:11:25.978 --> 02:11:27.980
WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:29.314
SURE WE ARE SUPPORTING OUR

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:31.416
WORKFORCE- EIGHT HUNDRED

02:11:31.483 --> 02:11:32.551
PATHWAYS PROGRAM THAT I SPOKE

02:11:32.618 --> 02:11:35.554
ABOUT EARLIER IS REALLY- WORKING

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:36.888
TO DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.423
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TRAINING

02:11:38.490 --> 02:11:40.158
AND SUPPORT FOR OUR I JUST AS

02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:42.728
PROVIDERS THAT'S GOING TO

02:11:42.794 --> 02:11:44.329
INCLUDE PAYING THEM FOR THEIR

02:11:44.396 --> 02:11:45.864
TRAINING HOURS. IT'S GOING TO

02:11:45.931 --> 02:11:47.799
INCLUDE IN. TO MAKE SURE THAT

COACHING SUPPORT TO PROVIDE

CAREER LATTICES FOR PEOPLE. SO I

02:11:54.106 --> 02:11:55.707
THINK WORKFORCE TO ME IT'S JUST

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:58.277
ABSOLUTE TOP OF THE LIST. ON

02:11:58.343 --> 02:11:59.611
NEXT I THINK OUR BIGGEST

02:11:59.678 --> 02:12:02.114
CHALLENGE IS MAKING SURE THAT WE

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:05.183

OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN THE I JUST

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:09.454
AS- I'M SPACE I THINK. THAT WHAT

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:10.622
WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR DURING

02:12:10.689 --> 02:12:13.058
THE PANDEMIC WAS THE NEED FOR AN

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:15.060
INTERACTIVE SYSTEM- WE ARE

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:16.995
CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:20.165
THAT. WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING-

02:12:20.232 --> 02:12:21.700
FINALIZE THAT WE HAVE TRAILER

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:22.701
BILL LANGUAGE OUT WE'VE BEEN

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:24.202
WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH

STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH THE

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:27.339
LEGISLATURE. TO REALLY FIND- THE

02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:29.341
PATH FORWARD ON A PERMANENT DACA

02:12:29.408 --> 02:12:31.476
SYSTEM SO THAT IF SOMEONE HAS

02:12:31.543 --> 02:12:36.481
SOMEONE YOU KNOW A PROVIDER. WHO

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:37.049

SERVICES THAT THERE'S TO PROVIDE

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:39.718
SERVICE. AND THEN I THINK THREE

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:41.153
IT'S SOMETHING BE THOUGHT ABOUT.

02:12:41.219 --> 02:12:44.056

AND SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DOING A

02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:52.203
LOT OF WORK ON GETTING A LOT OF

02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:54.072
THOUGHT TO I JUST WANT TO SAY

02:16:54.139 --> 02:16:55.373
FIRST. OF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:58.176
ABILITY TO DO A TEMPORARY- YOU

02:16:58.243 --> 02:17:00.712
KNOW SORT OF A STEP DOWN FROM OR

02:17:00.779 --> 02:17:01.746
OUT OF STATE FACILITIES WE

02:17:01.813 --> 02:17:03.548
BROUGHT ALL THE U. FAQ THERE IS

02:17:03.615 --> 02:17:05.750
A CURRENT PROCESS IN PLACE WHERE

02:17:05.817 --> 02:17:08.119
IF THERE'S A CHILD SPECIFIC NEED

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:09.621
FOR AN OUT OF STATE FACILITY. A

02:17:09.688 --> 02:17:11.823
COUNTY CAN APPLY FOR THAT. NOT

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:15.093
HAD ANY COUNTY'S ACTIVATE THAT-

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:18.363
THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT CHOICE

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:20.398
AND SO WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE

02:17:20.465 --> 02:17:21.933
ANY CHILDREN PLACE OUT OF STATE.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.803
I'M NOT LEASES TO REALLY LOOK AT

02:17:24.869 --> 02:17:26.605
WHAT ARE IN STATE- CAPACITY AND

02:17:26.671 --> 02:17:28.039
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR OUR USE-

02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:29.941
ON. THAT IS A COMPLICATED

02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:31.910
QUESTION I DO WANT TO BE HONEST

02:17:31.977 --> 02:17:33.678
BECAUSE WHAT THE CAPACITY NEEDS

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:35.313
ARE ARE GOING TO BE SPECIFIC BY

02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:38.083
COUNTY. BUT ALSO SPECIFIC BY THE

02:17:38.149 --> 02:17:40.051
MIX OF CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THE

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:41.152
FOSTER SYSTEM AT ANY GIVEN TIME

02:17:41.219 --> 02:17:43.054

CAN USE WHEN WE HAVE MORE

02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:06.911
COMPLEX CARE IS ONE OF THE

02:18:06.978 --> 02:18:07.846
THINGS WE'RE EXPLORING. A WITH
