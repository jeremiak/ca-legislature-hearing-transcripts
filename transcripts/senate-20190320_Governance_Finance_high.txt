TOO EARLY LEADERS AND THE MEDICAL CANNABIS MOVEMENTS WHO WERE PROVIDING -- MEDICAL CANNABIS. TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV I IN SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE THERE WAS ANY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT -- FOR HIV AIDS -- THE SAVE LIVES AND MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER AND SO WE HONOR THEM BY TITLING THIS BILL IN THERE. IN THERE HONOR AND MEMORY -- COLLEAGUES I SP THIRTY FOUR WILL INSURE THAT LOW INCOME -- PATIENTS WHO RELY ON MEDICAL CANNABIS TO SURVIVE AND BE HEALTHY. ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE I'VE DONATED MEDICAL CANNABIS. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE MEDICAL CANNABIS -- AND THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVING IT FOR FOR PASSIONATE CARE OUR COLLECTIVES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE THE KIND OF THIS FOR FREE.

BY HIV AIDS IT IS IMPORTANT FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES SUFFERING FROM CANCER GLAUCOMA ANOTHER HEALTH CHALLENGES MANY VETERANS RELY ON THESE PROGRAMS -- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT UNFORTUNATELY -- WHEN -- WHEN -- CANNABIS -- FOR USE WAS LEGALIZED IN CALIFORNIA I'LL BE A PROP. SIXTY FOUR THE BEES -- PROGRAMS WERE SUBJECTED I BELIEVE INADVERTENTLY -- TO TAXATION I SO NOW IF YOU ARE GIVING AWAY A FREE MEDICAL CANNABIS TO LOW INCOME PATIENTS.

I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. MAYBE WE COULD DO I SP ONE TWENTY EIGHT FIRST OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE CHAIR. OKAY GREAT. THE ONE TWENTY EIGHT PLEASE THANK YOU ARE YOUR GOOD MORNING -- TERM MEMBERS SO. NOW WE HAVE WORKED WITH -- OUR COMMITTEE FOR YEARS TO CREATE -- AND REFINED -- FINANCING TOOLS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROJECTS -- ONE METHOD. THAT WE DID -- WAS SP SIX TWENTY EIGHT WHICH I AUTHORED -- IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT. THAT WAS ADOPTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND IT WAS KIND OF ADOPTED AS THE I GUESS. IN RESPONSE TO THE DISSOLUTION. OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES IN THE LEGISLATURE -- STRUGGLED. WITH THE WITH THE HOW DO WE KEEP. THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENGINE RUNNING. IN A WAY WHERE IT DOESN'T HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT. ON THE GENERAL FUND OF THE STATE. AND ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO COMPLETE SOME PROJECTS THEY'RE NEEDED FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO. IT WAS THE ONE OF THE FIRST ATTEMPTS [inaudible] TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS. ARE PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THAT WAY OF FINANCES NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE PROP PROJECTS. WITH THE ATTACKS IN CURRENT FINANCING. OF THE PROPERTY TAX ARE ALLOCATED. TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS ARE NOT NEW TAXES -- OR SPECIAL SECTIONS IN THE BONDS DO NOT RESULT. IN INCREASED BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYERS. THIS IS A USEFUL TOOL. IT'S UNDER UTILIZED HOWEVER AND WE LOOKED IN SOME OF THE BARRIERS. TO UTILIZING THESE TOOLS. IN FACT THE THE CENTER OFFICE RESEARCH PREPARED A STUDY EVALUATING THESE TOOLS. I FELT THAT -- ALTHOUGH THERE WERE THERE WERE ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN OTHER BILLS -- THE THERE WERE BARRIERS -- TO THE BILLS BEING ACTUALLY UTILIZE IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THERE HAS BEEN SOME. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN -- EFFECTIVELY USE THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- THE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCER DISTRICTS REQUIRE 55% VOTES TO ISSUE BONDS. THE VOTER REQUIRE THIS VOTER REQUIREMENT -- WHICH WAS NOT APPLIED TO REDEVELOPMENT BONDS. IT WAS A BARRIER IT IT'S BURDENSOME FOR IMPLEMENTING THE KEY PURPOSES OF INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS ISSUING BONDS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. IT ADDS AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY. AND RESTRICTS THE ABILITY. OF INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS -- TO MAKE LONG TERM COMMITMENTS. THE SOLUTION IS TO ELIMINATE THE VOTE REQUIREMENT. TO ISSUE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT BARNES. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CHAIR. ON TO ALLOW INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT -- TO MAKE THEIR INVESTMENT AND ALSO GETTING PUBLIC INPUT BY HAVING A BEEFED UP PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS. WELL NOT HAVING FIRST FUTURE pTHE THE PROCESS. WE WILL ACCEPT THE COMEDIANS AMENDMENTS AND REPLACE THE ELECTION WITH A VOTER PROTEST PROCESS SIMILAR TO OTHER FINANCING BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY OUR COMMITTEE HERE. THIS BILL SP. ONE TWENTY EIGHT STREAMLINES THE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING TO THE DISTRICT TOOL MAKES IT MORE PRACTICAL. AND A TRACTORS THOSE TOOL FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. AND I LIKE TO TURN OUT TO MY WITNESSES MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ABOUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS WHO WOULD LIKE TO KICK US OFF IN IF YOU COULD JUST PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES THANK YOU. OKAY THREE MINUTES I TALK FAST AND GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KERR BACKS AHEAD OF THAT I'M THAT PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S A LONG NAME BUT IT'S THE ASSOCIATION OF THE PRACTITIONERS THE CITY COUNTY AND OTHER STAFF THAT WORK ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP BUSINESSES THRIVE. SINCE THE LOSS THE REDEVELOPMENT OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO MOVE PROJECTS FORWARD AND ALSO TO WRITE REVITALIZE THEIR COMMUNITIES BUT IT'S BECOME REALLY CLEAR. THAT WE DO NEED TO TOOL LIKE TAX INCREMENT FINANCING IN PARTICULAR THE E. I. F. T. TOOL SO THAT WE CAN BRING MORE RESOURCES TO THE TABLE TO GET SUBSTANTIVE PROJECTS DONE. WE'RE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE SENATORS AND LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING THE TOOL TO BEGIN WITH AND HELPING US FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR COMMUNITIES -- TO TO ACTUALLY USE THE TOOL SO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THAT YOU HELP TO SAVE THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SET ASIDE FOR THE CD BG PROGRAM. AND ALSO THE WORK TAKES STAND CLEAR AS WELL SO -- WE ASK THAT YOU WORK WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED AT THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN CONTINUING IT AND FINDING WAYS TO MAKE THE E. I. F. T. TOOL MORE PRACTICAL PRACTICAL. AND USEFUL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THIS POINT I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO ERIN LAUREL WHO IS OUR INCOMING CHAIR BUT ALSO THE MANAGER THE CITY MANAGER OF THE CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO. SO YOU CAN HEAR A MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE WITH THE TOOL ON WHY THIS IS SO NECESSARY. I WOULD SAY THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB ONE TWENTY EIGHT AND THAT -- AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON MAKING IT MORE PRACTICAL AND USEFUL TOOL IN THE SHOP THANK YOU SO MUCH. MORE MISSING MANAGER. THANK YOU UGH MORE COMMITTEE OF FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THIS TOPIC OF STARTING THIS BE SIX TWENTY EIGHT AND MOVING FORWARD SINCE THEN. OSCAR BACKS -- MISSIONS AND MANAGER OF THE SEA WAS SACRAMENT OVER ONE OF THREE IDEAS IN THE STATE WE ARE ACTUALLY THE FIRST ONE WAS SET UP. THERE'S MANY MORE -- COMMUNITIES LOOKING INTO THIS BUT AS WAS MENTIONED THIS ISSUE LIBERATION OF OF THE USE OF THIS TOOL THE OTHER ONE IS THE SUBJECT OF THE OF THE NEXT BILL. BUT ON THE BOND ISSUANCE -- ISSUE -- FIRST. IN THE AFTERMATH REDEVELOPMENT -- THE NON GOING PROCESS OF RESHAPING OUR TAX INCREMENT TOOLS -- FOR THINGS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE STABLE DEVELOPMENT AND INFORMAL HOUSING -- THIS THIS THE I'VE D. TOOL HAS A LOT OF PROMISE. BUT AGAIN THE THE EXISTING -- REQUIREMENT IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE FOR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY SMALLER ONES THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT -- VOTE REQUIREMENT LATER ON AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT TAKES TO SET UP ONE OF THESE DISTRICTS IT'S JUST NOT. WORTH THE RISK IN IN KNOWING THAT THAT'S LOOMING OUT THERE SO WE BELIEVE WITH THIS FIX TO SEE A LOT MORE CITIES -- MOVE AHEAD WITH DISTRICT FORMATIONS ESPECIALLY THOSE MORE CREATIVE DISTRICTS WE'D ALL LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THEY COULD INCLUDE MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS CITIES AND COUNTIES WORKING TOGETHER. AUDIBLE CITIES WORKING TOGETHER TO REALLY REALIZE THE THE PROMISE OF WHAT HE ACT THESE CAN BECOME. SO ON THE AMENDMENTS WE WORK TO THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE -- TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE ON THE PROPOSED PROTEST LANGUAGE. WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT INCLUDING CURRYING PROTEST PROVISION IN THE STATUTE WOULD BE HUGE DETRIMENT. TO THE ISSUANCE OF BONDS LATER ON IT WOULD IT WOULD PUT UP BECAUSE A LOT OF RISK ON ON THE BONDS OF CELLS AND BOND BUYERS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE THAT ON SO WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE GONNA CONSIDER PROTEST REVISION. OF YOURS THAT YOU YOU CONSIDER IT ONLY FOR TAKING PLACE THE TIME OF THE I. T. FORMATION NOT ON A RECURRING BASIS. THERE'S ALSO SOME TECHNICAL FIXES IN THE BILL THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE CARE OF AND ALSO WANTED TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS. THE OPPOSITION LETTER ONE OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS YOU YOU RECEIVED A THERE'S A COUPLE IN THIS CHARACTERIZATIONS ABOUT THE BILL IN THERE -- WANT TO CLARIFY THE ACT THESE ARE NOT THE NEW TAX -- THIS IS EXISTING PROPERTY TAX SO PORTRAYING IT AS SUCH IS IS -- INACCURATE AND AND FRANKLY WITH WITH REPRESENTATION FROM CITY COUNCILS AND PUBLIC MEMBERS I THINK THE BILL OR THE ORIGINAL YET THE STATUE WAS SET UP TO PROVIDE THAT REPRESENTATION. SO -- WITHOUT ALL CLOSE IN AND THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR CITY MANAGER AT WE'RE GOING TO ASK THOSE WHO ARE INSUPPORT TO PLEASE COME FORWARD IS FOLKS START COMING FORWARD. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN TO CENTERED ABOUT FOR HIS WORK THE PUBLIC INPUT PORTION OF THE PROTEST PORTION -- WITH IN THESE DISTRICTS ARE DUE TO THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS ACCEPTED BY CENTER BALLOT WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF THE FORMATION PROCESS -- SO VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE DANCING HERE TODAY -- ISN'T ABOUT WOULD LIKE ME TO GO THROUGH -- BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY WILL TURN IT OVER.

WE'RE NOT EXACTLY A TWEENER WE'RE ALL WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR WE WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WE'RE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING THIS IS NOT A NEW TAX ON OUR MEMBERS.

ALRIGHT WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BETTER TURN OVER TO THOSE WHO OPPOSE WE HAVE -- IN INDIVIDUAL MISTER WOLF WAS CAN BE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION AND THEN. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK MISTER WOLF FOR SURE SIR GOOD MORNING MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU I DAVID WOLF HERE AT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. OPPOSED SP -- ONE TWENTY EIGHT ONE REITERATE FIRST OF ALL MEMBERS THAT AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT A NEW TAX THIS USES EXISTING PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. THEY'RE NOT SURE WHICH OPPONENTS MADE THAT ARGUMENT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT US -- JUST BY WAY OF CONTEXT SENATOR BAIL DID INTRODUCE SB SIX TWENTY EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HARRY JARVIS ALSO DID OPOSE THAT BAIL -- FOR THE REASON PRIMARILY THAT A IT FAILED TO SET A TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR LONG TERM-DAD -- AND OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL IN ITS ANY VOTER APPROVAL SO OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE BELL WERE CONCERNED MEMBERS THAT SP ONE TWENTY EIGHT REALLY DOES DISREGARD OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OF PRECEDENT. REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF VOTER APPROVED AT IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND REALLY THE STATES ALL THE WAY BACK TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE PRACTICALLY ALL BONDS NOT ALL BUT CERTAINLY THE LARGE MAJORITY HAVE ACQUIRED A SUPER MAJORITY THRESHOLD. OF 55% OR HIGHER TO BE APPROVED -- AND I THINK THAT MAINTAINING THAT SUPER MAJORITY THRESHOLDS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS DAD THAT'S GOING TO REMAIN ON THE BOOKS -- FOUR YEARS AFTER THE I FD BOARD WHICH IS CONSISTING OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PRIMARILY HAS TURNED OUT. THEY'VE APPROVED IT THEY TURNED OUT THIS DATA IS ON THE BOOKS FOR AS LONG AS FORTY FIVE YEARS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE VOTER ACCOUNTABILITY. IN ADDITION E. I. F. T. BONDS ARE NOT THE SAME AS LOCAL GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND. OKAY -- LOCAL GEO BONDS HAVE THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF A LOCAL GENERAL FIND BACK IN THE BLIND YEAH I F. T. BOND THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT. OF THE MUNICIPALITY BACKING UP THE SPONSOR IS NOT THAT ASSURANCE AND WE DO THINK THAT CREATES A MUCH GREATER RISK FOR TAX PAYERS AS WELL AS HIGHER INTEREST COSTS -- I WILL SAY IN REGARDS TO THE PROTEST PROCEDURE JUST IN CLOSING -- YOU KNOW WE ARE PLEASED OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT'S AN AMENDMENT IN THE BILL BECAUSE IT DOES PROVIDE SOME PROCESS FOR TAXPAYERS TO SPEAK. INTO THE I FD BONDS IN THE SITUATION THEY'RE IN BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME AS AN ACTUAL VOTE. FOR LONG TERM DEBT AND ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE JUST DOING IT THE PROTEST PROCEDURE IN THE E. I. F. T. FORMATION IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME AS AN ACTUAL VOTE. ON LOCAL YOU KNOW LOCAL BOND AT THE COULD AST UP TO FORTY FIVE YEARS SO FOR THOSE REASONS ASK FOR NOVA. REFORMIST WILL THANK YOU SO MUCH WITH ACTING NOW FOR THE MICROPHONE THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED PLEASE COME. FOR LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO OPEN UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR VICE CHAIR AND SENT A WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER. THE BELLI. I I WILL I JUST FROM A HISTORICAL CONTEXT I I WENT THROUGH A RATHER LARGE LAWSUIT THERE. TOO ARTICLES THE STATE CONSTITUTION THAT REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL FOR ANY THAT. ANY DEBT THAT. AND THAT INCLUDES I THOUGHT PENSION LIABILITIES TO THAT IF YOU CREATED A NEW PENSION THAT RIGHT AWAY IT HAD TO BE PAID OVER A LONGER TIME. THAT SHOULD ALSO -- HAVE A CHRISSY VOTER APPROVAL. SUPREME COURT DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR THE CASE BUT I SORT OF GOT IMMERSED IN THAT SUBJECT SITE I GUESS. THE QUESTION THAT I THE COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK IS -- DID. REMOVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE VOTERS WEIGH IN ON APPROVING DAT IS. IS IS THAT DOES THAT REQUIRE. A STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. WELL WE HAVE SOME BOND EXPOSURE LIKE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE THAT [inaudible] SURE. IN A STATEMENT. A GOOD GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S CONSTANTINE BURN OFF. I'M AN ATTORNEY SHAREHOLDER WITH THE LAW FIRM OF CHRONIC MOSKOVITZ STEDMAN AND GERARD. IN SACRAMENTO. I'VE BEEN PRACTICING MUNICIPAL FINANCE LOVE FOR APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN YEARS. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. WHEN IT COMES? TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SENATOR -- THAT PROVISION APPLIES TO CITIES COUNTIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- THE I. IF THESE ARE NOT DO NOT FALL WITHIN THAT CATEGORY SO THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION. SO THEN ARE THEY SIMILAR. TO CERTIFICATES OF PARTICIPATION. FOR YOU HAVE A REVENUE STREAM YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET VOTER APPROVAL [inaudible] YOUR ARM. IN IN A IN A JUST A VERY ABBREVIATED WITHIN EIGHT EXPLANATION YES THEY THEY THEY COULD BE VIEWED IN THAT MANNER -- CERTIFICATES OF PARTICIPATION ARE ARE ARE STRUCTURED AS LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND THERE'S PROVISIONS IN THEM WHICH OF PROVIDE FOR EGGS A WAY AROUND THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL DEBT LIMITATIONS -- THESE ARE ARE STRUCTURED AS BOND SO THEY'RE NOT LEASES -- BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD YOU COULD VIEW IT AND AND THAT WAY. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO EARN A DESK LAMP ISSUE A LOT OF BONDS TUESDAY A LOT OF FUN. BUT JUST TRYING TO GET MY ARMS AROUND THIS THING I HAVE FOR A LOOK AT ANTI MAYBE THIS NEEDS A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON THE FLOOR. MR WILL GIVE ANY [inaudible] OBSERVATIONS -- COMMENTS YEAH SOME ROCK THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I MEAN I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE ATTORNEY HERE IN QUESTIONS THAT -- YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS WE RELISH THIS YOU KNOW DID REQUIRED HE THIRDS ABOUT AN AMENDMENT IN THE CONSTITUTION WE ARE JUST AMENDING STATUTES THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICT PROGRAM WHICH WAS IN STATUTE. AND YOU GIVE THE DATE OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHEN THIS WAS ADDED TO THE STATE CONSTITUTION. I SAID EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE YOU KNOW THAT THE FORMATION -- FOR YOU KNOW LONG TERM DEBT AND A TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR BONDS DOES DATE ALL THE WAY BACK TO THAT PERIOD. IN FROM HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE I BELIEVE IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE TRY TO GET A REAL ROAD IN THE TOWN IT FAILED BUT THREE OF THE FIVE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS INDICTED THE CITY AND IT ACTUALLY WENT BANKRUPT BACK IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SORT OF A TRIVIA. QUESTION BUT BEFORE MY TIME SENATOR YEAH. IT ACTUALLY WASN'T A AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION WAS GERMAN IT WAS A NEW CONSTITUTION. BECAUSE WE PASS A NEW CONSTITUTION TO EXCLUDE TO CERTAIN ETHNIC GROUPS FROM CALIFORNIA TOLD HIM IT WAS PROVED UNCONSTITUTIONAL SO A PAST SECOND CONSTITUTION. BUT I THINK THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF THESE BONDS IS IS DOES IT REQUIRE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT IF IT'S A FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE VOTERS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA THAN IT BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE IF YOU'RE RELYING ON THE DELEGATION THE PARTICULAR PROJECT WITH ITS REVENUE BONDS TO VIEW THEY SHARE THE LIKE. HE DOESN'T REQUIRE -- THE VOTE YOU SO MUCH SIR. AND THEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE QUICKLY SISTER GERMAN ON ONE QUICK QUICK GOOD ADDITION -- REDEVELOPING BONDS DID NOT REQUIRE BOTH EITHER. AND WE'RE TRYING TO WIN FREE DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES EXIST EXISTED BECAUSE THEIR PLATE BASED ON A TAX INCREMENT.

SO -- THERE IS A LOT OF IMPORTS -- THAT RESULTED IN THIS BILL. SO I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THE TIME AND EFFORT -- I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO STAFF AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THESE AMENDMENTS ALONG WITH THE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENTS NOW IN PRINT. ADDRESS MOST OF THE IMPORTANT FISCAL ISSUES RAISED BY OUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS IS STAGGERING R. SP. FIVE IT'S A DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS IT HELPS ALLEVIATE POVERTY CREATES JOBS. MEETS OUR STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WITHOUT AFFECTING SCHOOL FUNDING. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CALIFORNIA'S HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE THE ESTIMATE A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND NECESSARY HOUSING UNITS PER YEAR. THE RESULT. NEARLY A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE LIVED ON THE STREETS -- THIS LAST YEAR. ANOTHER TWO POINT TWO MILLION EXTRA AND VERY -- LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS ARE COMPETING. FOR ONLY SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES. AND I MIGHT ADD. THE FIRES AND THE DISASTERS HAVE MADE IT. EXTREMELY WORST ESPECIALLY AND SO OF OUR SENATORS DISTRICTS. SO THIS LEAVES MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS OF OF LOWING LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO HOUSING AND AND REALLY OUT AT SERIOUS RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. THE STATE MUSTACHE WITH EMERGENCY TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE. THIS BILL SP FIVE MAKES THE STATE A LONG TERM PARTNER. AND PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED MONEY TO SPARE AFFORDABLE SPUR OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION ACROSS THE STATE. IT PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT ONGOING INVESTMENT RAMPING UP TO TWO BILLION ANNUALLY OVER TIME. AND OFFERS AN EFFECTIVE FINANCE TO LOST WHEN THE STATE TO RESIST DISSOLVED OUR REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. SPECIFICALLY SP FIVE ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO COLLABORATE ON A STATE APPROVED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS. WHICH WILL BE FUNDED BY REDUCING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE EDUCATIONAL REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUNDS. THE FUNDING CAN BE USED IN THE FOLLOWING FIVE PURPOSES FOR MY HOUSING. TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT INFILL DEVELOPMENT REVITALIZING AND RESTORING NEIGHBORHOODS. AND PLANNING AND ALL RIGHTS ISSUES. A MINIMUM OF 50% OF THE MONEY MUST BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THERE'S A 12% SET ASIDE FOR RURAL CITIES AND COUNTIES. THE BILL CREATES A COMMITTEE HOUSE UNDER THE HOUSING COMMUTE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW AND APPROVE PROPOSE PLANS PROVIDING SOME STRONG STATE OVERSIGHT. THE COMMITTEE IS ALSO IN POWER TO TAKE CORRECTIONAL ACTION -- WHEN LOCALS DO NOT MEET THEIR PLANS OBJECTIVES? THIS WAS NOT TRUE IN THE REDEVELOPMENT OF LAW THAT WE HAVE WE NOW HAVE A LOG THAT HAS ACCOUNTABILITY BUILT IN -- WOULD LIKE TO HEAR OUR WITNESSES AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESSES AT THIS TIME. AND SEA OF YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE ERROR OKAY. ASSISTANT MANAGER GOOD MORNING FLOOR SORCERY A THREE MINUTE WARNING AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND CENTER BELFRY WORK ON THIS BILL -- SO ON THIS ONE I'M I'M REPRESENTING KHALLID AND ALSO THE LEAGUE OF CITIES -- AS IN IN IN IN SUPPORT. THIS BILL SP FIVE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE WERE TWO BIG ISSUES -- THAT THAT ARE PREVENTING THE WIDESPREAD PROLIFERATION OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING ONE WAS THE ISSUE JUST DRESS THE OTHER. IS THE LACK OF AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR MOST CITIES AND COUNTIES YOU DON'T GET A LARGE SHARE OF THE PROPERTY TAXES WHY LOT OFONE OF THESE DISTRICTS HAVEN'T MOVED FORWARD. ALSO THAT THE THAT ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED HEAD ON BY S. B. FIVE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK IT DOES SO IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE WAY THAT PUTS THE STATE A POSITION MAKING SURE THE INVESTMENTS -- IN THESE PROJECTS ARE APPROPRIATE -- ALSO MAKING SURE THAT SCHOOLS ARE FINANCIALLY IMPACTED AS THEY WERE UNDER THE REDEVELOPMENT PARADIGM. SO SP FIVE IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT VERY CREATIVE SHIN TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS AND SOME OF THE OBSTRUCTION PROBLEMS THAT ARE. PLAGUING THE STATE. AND SO ON BEHALF OF CALLAN LEAGUE CITIES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ARRIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A TEENAGER. GOOD MORNING SIR. GOOD MORNING DAN CAL MUCCI I'M A RESEARCHER WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS REGIONAL COUNCIL -- IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP WE EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE FUNDS FROM SENATE BILL FIVE AS IT WAS INTRODUCED. WE USE THE IMPLANT INPUT OUTPUT MODEL WHICH IS WIDELY ACCEPTED AS THE INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS. OUR MODEL IS BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. AND LIKE THAT PROGRAM WE EXPECT THE STATE'S DIRECT INVESTMENT FROMSP FIVE TO BE LEVERAGED OVER THREE TIMES FROM LOW INCOME TAX CREDITS. LOCAL FUNDS OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS AND PRIVATE SOURCES. THESE INVESTMENTS COULD TRANSLATE INTO OVER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THREE TWENTY TWENTY NINE FURTHER OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT OVER THE NEXT DECADE THESE INVESTMENTS CAN PRODUCE OVER EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NEW AND REHABILITATED HOUSING UNITS. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE LOCAL TAX REVENUE. TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LABOR INCOME AND SUPPORT APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND JOBS INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND FAMILY SUPPORTING PREVAILING WAGE CONSTRUCTION JOBS WITH HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS. THANKS TO EXISTING PUBLIC WORKS APPRENTICESHIP REQUIREMENTS PROJECTS THAT RECEIVE INVESTMENTS VIA SP FIVE WILL SUPPORT WORK FORCE TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR VETERANS AND FOR OTHERS JUST BEGINNING THEIR CONSTRUCTION CAREERS. APPRENTICESHIP IS BOTH AN ESCALATOR TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAS A SKILLED CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE WE NEED TO ADDRESS HOUSING SHORTAGES. THAT'S ME FIVE WILL NOT ONLY HELP US MEET THE STATE'S URGENT NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. IT'S A FACTUAL RIPPLE THROUGHOUT OUR ECONOMY RESULTING IN MORE JOBS INCREASED CONSUMER SPENDING AND MORE TAX REVENUE. IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN THE STATE'S CURRENT.

SHIFTING ERA FUNDS COULD HAVE ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WE APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE IT HAS BEEN CREATED SO FAR IT CERTAINLY IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT ULTIMATELY IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT USING THE ROUTE FUNDS WHILE IT MAY NOT POSE A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. IF WE GET INTO ANOTHER FISCAL DECLINE AND WE SEE THE SUSPENSION OF PROP NINETY EIGHT WHICH WE NOW HAVE A PRECEDENT OF HAVING DONE THAT TWICE DURING THE LAST. RECESSION DOT COULD PUT IMPACTED SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN A MORE FISCALLY PRECARIOUS SITUATION FIFTY EIGHT POINT 7% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ON FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH IT'S OFTEN ARE SCHOOLS THAT ARE PROVIDING THE MOST STABLE OPPORTUNITY. FOR STUDENTS THAT DO YOU -- SUFFER FROM THE EFFECTS OF POVERTY TRANSITIONAL HOUSING ANOTHER ISSUE SO -- WE ARE TRYING TO WORK TO SEE IF WE CAN OFFER -- FURTHER STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- IF THE BILL DOES CONTINUE TO USE YOUR ROUTE FUNDS -- IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL BUT NEVER THE LESS WE'RE COMMITTED TO TRY TO WORK WITH YOU TOWARDS THAT END. FOR THE IN HEAVY IF YOU WANNA HANG YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME -- WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE WHO HAS CONCERNS OR WHO MAYBE OPPOSED. TO BE ABLE TO PLEASE COME FORWARD AT THIS TIME. HEARING SEEN ON THIS BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE -- I HAVE AWESOME COMMENTS BUT IN TERMS IN A WINNER IN THE INTO CENTER HURTS FOR EXAMINER I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN FURTHER PROOF THAT I SHOULD NEVER MAKE ANY COMMENTS FROM A COFFEE IN THE MORNING IN THE COMMENTS I MADE. HONESTLY IT'S TWO ONE TWO EIGHT I MEANT ASIAN AT OTHER BILL I DON'T THINK IT'S COMING TO THE HOUSE IN COMMITTEE -- SO AGAIN I'LL BE VOTING FOR THIS OTHER BUILDS LIKE WHEN THE HOUSING I DON'T THINK IT WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR YEAH -- NEWS YEAH. NOW I ONLY I ONLY GOT ONE CENTER ABOUT -- BUT I'LL BE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY -- BUT MYSELF AND I WILL BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS IN THIS BILL. AS IT COMES TO HELPING TO MEET IN NEXT TWO WEEKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I I RECOGNIZE THERE'S SOME WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON A HOUSING START. TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR ON THAT ISSUE ABSOLUTELY NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO SEND A WINNER WITH A TURNOVER TO SEND HER TO BROKEN INTO OUR VICE CHAIR -- I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BUT I HAVE A CONCERN NOT ABOUT THE ISSUE BUT ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE THANK. GOVERNOR BROWN -- FOR HARD TO CHANGE OUR LAW WITH RESPECT TO REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. IN MY VIEW FOR THREE IMPORTANT REASONS FIRST. HE AND HIS ROLE AS THE MAYOR OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CITY WAS INFORMED BY. ABUSES IN OTHER THINGS THAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE VELLUM DEVELOPERS. TO HE WAS CONCERNED THAT -- USING TAX INCREMENT FINANCING ADVERSELY AFFECTED EDUCATION WHICH WE JUST HEARD. AND COULD DO SO IN THE FUTURE. AND THIRD THE COUNTIES WERE BEING ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET FUNDS THAT WERE AVAILABLE. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES IN AREAS WHERE THROUGH AN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT OR THE LIKE HOW DO YOU GET FUNDING TO GET THERE -- THERE HAS BEEN AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS NOTION OF OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. OPPORTUNITIES OWNS USES INSTEAD OF TAX FUND A PROPERTY TAX MONEY. WHICH IS SO MUCH STRESS ON IT. UTILIZES INCOME TAX AND THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGED THE LAW THAT MAKES LESS DEDUCTIBILITY FOR US IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THAT IT THERE'S ACTUAL INCENTIVE IN CALIFORNIA UTILIZE INCOME TAX. TO ACHIEVE THE DELIVERABLES YOU DON'T REALLY CARE WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM YOU CARE ABOUT A DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM THAT GROWS AS FINANCE WILL THAT WILL ALLOW THE THE OBJECTIVE TO BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING OTHER IMPORTANT SOCIAL ISSUES. AND SO I KNOW THE GOVERNOR JUST SPOKE RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN CONFERENCES ALL OVER THE PLACE IS PEOPLE HUSTLING EVERYWHERE THE REGULATIONS ARE. UNDER REVIEW WE'RE WORKING FULL TIME IN THIS AREA AND SO. ALL I'M SUGGESTING IS IT IN MY PURPOSE OF MY COMMENTS IS NOT TO LOSE ANY OF THE JUST TO SIGN POST THIS ISSUE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. BOTH WITH RESPECT ON THE TAX ELEMENT AND TO TRY TO THINK THROUGH IN RE ENGINEER AS WE GO FORWARD. PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A DEDUCTIBILITY OF SOMEBODY'S TAXES AT THE AT A BECAUSE THE FEDERAL LAW THAT THERE COULD BE SOME INTERESTING AND EASY WAYS. TO ACHIEVE THE EXACT DELIVERABLES THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE THEIR ALTERNATIVE MECHANISM. BUT I DO THINK PARTICULARLY GIVEN YOUR EXPRESSES -- EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE CLOSE THERE TOO BY VIRTUE OF ALL OF YOUR ROLES IN GOVERNMENT AND EXPERIENCES EXTRAORDINARY THAT IS WORTHY. OF CONTINUING THIS DISCUSSION BUT I JUST WANT TO SIGN POST IS BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE'RE IN A IN A IS A A PLACE WHERE -- WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TO MAKE A TURN AND THAT MAYBE GOVERNOR BROWN WAS RIGHT AND WHAT HE DID AND MAYBE WE GOT LUCKY WITH RESPECT TO WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS. WORKING WITH US AND WE CAN MAYBE EVEN CLOSE SO WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE TO TRY TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVES. BUT I JUST SHARE THOSE IDEAS WITH YOU SIR AND I KNOW WHAT A POLICY WONK YOU ARE. AND AND IT WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND HAVE THESE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND -- YEAH -- WE HAVE A I WANNA I WANNA -- PUT INTO THE RECORD THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A LETTER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S -- MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST -- HAS LOOKED AT THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY. AND IS STATING AND THE LETTER THAT -- THE REQUIREMENTS IN OUR BILL -- MEANS IS EFFECTIVELY WOULD BE COVERING THE CARS TO THIS PROGRAM. AND IN TERMS OF OF SCHOOL FUNDING. SO IT AS OPPOSED TO REDEVELOPMENT REDEVELOPMENT -- JUST GIVE THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IT ENDED UP -- SOMETHING LIKE FIVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL TAX INCREMENT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS STARTING OFF AT TWO HUNDRED MILLION NOT FIVE AND A HALF BILLION. SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE FACING THIS IN. OF IN TERMS OF A PHASE AND REDEVELOPMENT HAVE FIVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS -- AND IT IS SET IN A SENSE THAT'S WHY I SUPPORTED THE THE THE PROPOSAL OF THE GOVERNOR. WHEN I VOTED FOR IT? BECAUSE IT WAS JUST LIKE AN EITHER OR EITHER WE HAD TO CUT. FIVE AND HALF BILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE SCHOOL'S BUDGET. OR CONTINUE REDEVELOPMENT WE HAD WE HAD LIKE -- A CHOICE AND IF YOU REMEMBER. THE BUDGET SITUATION AT THAT TIME WHEN I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE -- IN THE ASSEMBLY. WE WERE GOING FROM I THINK WHEN I STARTED WAS A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN BILLION GENERAL FUND UNDER THE I THINK THE HIGH EIGHTIES EIGHTY NINE MAYBE. MILLET BILLION SO IT WAS IT WAS SUCH A DRAMATIC -- CUT BACK [inaudible] OF DAD IT RESULTED AND WE HAD TO REALLY. MASSIVELY CUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS OUT OF THE BUDGET INCLUDING REDEVELOPMENT. BUT WE TRIED OUR BEST. TO RESERVE AND SUPPORT [inaudible] SCHOOLS. SO THIS BILL. AS OPPOSED TO REDEVELOPMENT HAS. A SERIES OF THINGS INCLUDING THE RE MENTIONING A MEMBERS WE JUST -- THAT. PROTECT SCHOOL FUNDING. NOW THE SCHOOL'S ARGUMENT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ON THIS. IS THAT YOU'RE STILL MAKING. THE GENERAL FUND POT LOWER. THAT ARGUMENT WOULD STILL APPLY -- FOR OPPORTUNITY CELLS AS WELL IT WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD. YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR ARGUMENT OF THE GENERAL FUND BEING -- LESS RESOURCES PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON SCHOOL FINANCE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ARGUMENT BUT THE BILLITSELF THAT ARGUMENT COULD BE APPLIED TO ANY ALLOCATION. OF GENERAL FUND MONEY THAT'S OUTSIDE THE SCHOOLS HOW ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW I JUST YOU KNOW BRING UP ONE WAS A DIME ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WAS CENTER MORE LOG ON THAT ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU'RE ONE UP A BILLION BILLION DOLLARS JUST IN ONE YEAR? AND AND AND THAT YOU SAID YOU DON'T THINK THAT PUT PRESSURE ON THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF COURSE TO DO IT -- SO THIS BILL IS A FACE UP THE OTHER THING THAT HOUSE IN THE BILL IS WE HAVE A WE HAVE WHAT I WHAT I CALL I I TYPICALLY CALL PANIC BUTTON. IT ALLOWS A LEGISLATURE TO FREEZE AND A WHOLE. THE TAX INCREMENT PROGRAM. SO THE LEGISLATURE AS OPPOSED TO REDEVELOPMENT WOULD JUST KIND OF CONTINUES. WITHOUT OUR CONTROL THIS ALLOWS US. TO FREEZING CONTROL THAT POINT IN TIME WHERE THE FISCAL PROBLEMS. ARE A SUCH THAT THAT -- IT GOES INTO THE RESERVES OF THE STATE WE ALLOWS US THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT -- THE THIRD THINK THE THIRD THING IT DOES IN TERMS OF CHANGES FOR REDEVELOPMENT. REDEVELOPMENT -- REALLY WAS FURTHER MORE IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IT SPECIFIES WHERE THE MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT IT REQUIRES THEM TO COME UP WITH A A PLAN TO SUBMIT. THAT OUTLINES WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING TO BE SPENT. IT ALLOWS A COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THAT IT ALLOWS A COMMITTEE TO SAY IF YOU ARE COMPLETING YOUR PLAN YOUR HOUSING PROJECTS -- YOU KNOW. IF YOU'RE NOT COMPLAINERS HOUSING PROJECTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT YOU PUT IN THE PLANT. IT ALLOWS THE COMMITTEE -- TO TAKE TAKE ACTION. SO THERE ARE THERE ARE -- THOSE KINDS OF CONTROLS THAT READ ABOUT WHAT REALLY THEN HOW READ ABOUT WAS ONE OF YOU KNOW I CHAIRED THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN SAN JOSE SO I I I I THERE WAS NO CONTROLS ARE SIMPLY REPORT WENT TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER EVERY YEAR AND THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT. SO. SO -- THIS HAS USES DIFFERENT. AND BY SETTING UP THE PARAMETERS OF WHERE WE WE WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY -- WE ARE BENEFITING CERTAIN THINGS AND TARGETING THE MONEY TO CERTAIN THINGS THAT'S WHY. THE MAJORITY THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON HOUSE. BECAUSE WE NEED WE HAVE A CRISIS WE HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ON THAT WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING. SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITHOUT HURTING THE SCHOOLS THIS IS THIS IS THE THE THE WAY WE'RE TRYING TO FORMULATE THIS BILL AND THAT'S WE CAME UP WITH THIS BILL AFTER A LOT OF DISCUSSION WE ACTUALLY DISCUSSED IT WITH THE SCHOOLS WERE STILL GOING TO CONTINUE. TO TO WORK WITH THEM -- CENTER HERTZBERG AND AND THEY DO NEED MORE MONEY WE GOT IT WE GOT TO GET MORE MONEY TO SCHOOLS. THEY'RE ALSO SO -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP. SCHOOL KIDS HOUSE. I HAVE SCHOOL KIDS IN MY DISTRICT WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT CAME TO ME. AND SAID HE WANTED TO BE ALLOWED TO PUT -- CARS IN THE PARKING LOT AT THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN JOSE THE FUNKY SO THE PARENTS ARE HOMELESS CAN CAN. HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO PARK AND THE BILL ON THAT AND LIVE YOU KNOW SO WE WE GOT WE GOT KIND OF THIS -- SITUATION WHERE -- YEAH THAT DOES AFFECT THE SCHOOLS IN THE EDUCATION OF KIDS DOESN'T IT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A HOME. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE I I WAS HOMELESS AT THE ONE TIME WHEN OUR HOUSE CAUGHT ON FIRE AND BURN DOWN. SO I'M I'M AWARE OF WHAT IT MEANS YOUR WHAT IT WHAT. TRAUMA -- GOES THROUGH THE FAMILY ONE TWELVE OF US TO HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE. SO SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF WHICH YOU CAN USE IT HURTS FOR KLEE SLOANE OF THOUGHT JUST FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE COMMITTEE. AND THE RESPECT FOR THE OPERA ONE OF THE AUTHORS HERE. THE PRESENTER IS A GUY I COMPLETELY AGREE AND I SAW HOW YOU HAVE PUT ON THE VERY EVE THOUGHT THROUGH OVER THE EXPERIENCE. THAT THE THE PROCESS SEES WHILE I WAS TRYING TO DO. IT WAS TO RAISE THIS ISSUE IN THE SENSE THAT. ON YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU WANT HER TO TIER THREE ISSUES I DIE. THE IDEA IS A NINETY EIGHT THE THE IDEA IS TO FIGURE OUT IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS THERE'S NEW TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. THAT CAN REDUCE THAT COMPRESSION. THAT ALSO MAYBE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS TOGETHER IN OTHER METHODOLOGIES COULD BE A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY THAT FACT CREATE MORE HOUSING -- WHICH THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY IN IN IN YOUR DISTRICT -- SO SO THE THE THE A A AND AND A LARGER DYNAMIC OF PEAK SHAPING THE JUST THE LAST POINT I WANT TO RAISE IS THAT THE WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT. WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU SUFFERED THROUGH WHEN YOU WERE HERE AND I WASN'T AT THAT TIME -- WAS WAS THE THE VOLATILITY OF THE OF THE REVENUE SYSTEM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE FOR YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD A THAT COMES FROM THE MECHANISMS THAT WE USE TO FIND THE STATE AND THE CHALLENGE THAT HAS. THE GENIUS OF THE OPPORTUNITY ZONE ELEMENT AS IT INTEGRATES WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT AND ALL OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS AS I WANT TO JUST. AGAIN I'M NOT DIGGING AS DEEP AS YOU HAVE A JUST ONE TOP WANTED FOR THE DISCUSSION THIS COMMITTEE IS ITS PEAK SHAPE. BECAUSE IN ESSENCE WHAT IT DOES IT DEALS WITH CAPITAL GAINS THAT WE DON'T DEAL WITH SO WE CAN CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE SE SERVICE TAX THAT WOULD GO LIKE THIS. GET RID OF THE PEKING. USE THIS TO HELP COMMUNITIES THAT OPPORTUNITY ZONES THIS COULD ALL BE PART OF A LARGER DISCUSSION FINALLY TOUCH THIS BECAUSE IT'S IN THE WORLD THAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THIS COMMITTEE MY FORMER CAPACITY. OF WHICH YOU'VE BEEN WITH US FOR OVER FOUR YEARS WHEN I WAS HERE ORIGINALLY AND JUST TO THROW ON THE TABLE FOR THINKING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS STUFF I THINK THIS IS ALL ABOUT VOTING FOR THE MOVE THE BILL. WE HAD A IS ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR YA. I THINK CENTER WINNERS TAKEN -- CHARGE OF GETTING THAT -- WORKING ON THAT THIS IS THIS IS A PIECE OF IT THOUGH. THIS THIS IS SO ALL RIGHT AN OPPORTUNITY ROSE COULD BE ANOTHER PIECE WE NEED A LOT OF IT WE GOT WE'RE WE'RE SUCH AND SUCH BAD TROUBLE WE NEED TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. TO TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM PROBLEM. THANK YOU IT IS AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION INDOCIN WINNER I THINK THE ONE ISSUE. WHEN CENTER BELL AND I WERE LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF OPPORTUNITIES -- THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS IN NUMBER ONE LOOK AT WERE OPPORTUNITIES OWN SEVEN PLACE IT BENEFITS THE WEALTHIEST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN THERE IS A HUGE HIT TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT CAPS GAINS TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND -- TO TWENTY FORTY SEVEN AND THERE'SNO WAY TO BE A CONTROL THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE TO CONFORM WITH NEW TAX CODE WITH THE FEDS. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE HIT -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ZONES NOW THAT FEDERAL TAX CONFORM HAVE MOVED FORWARD. THERE ARE NO SAFEGUARDS FOR DISPLACEMENT WITHIN -- THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES IN NO LOCAL CONTROL TOTALLY UP TO THE INVESTOR WHO IS ADVANCING ON AN OPPORTUNITY SO INTO THEIR SOME CONCERNS ON THAT. WHICH WHICH WE'VE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WELL THE CHALLENGE OF THE TAX PIECES WE HAVE TO CONFORM THOUGH AND IN WE'RE TALKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THERE IS A BIG HIT THREE TWENTY FORTY SEVEN BUT THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THEY'RE VERY WELL AWARE OF IT AS WELL AS FAR AS THAT FLOW IN BECAUSE IT DOES CAP GAINS. ANYTHING GOING FORWARD THROUGH TWENTY FORTY SEVEN BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE DISCUSSION BUREAU -- WERE KIND THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CENTER THIS CURRENT BASED HERE IN CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN RDAS REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE WERE. REMOVED I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD. OF SUPERVISORS FOR COUNTIES I'D DO IT. DEALING WITH THE SUCCESSOR AGENCIES AND ALL THE REST BUT I THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH SOONER BELL THAT'S GONE ON SINCE TWENTY TWELVE AND THEN YOU'RE PART OF IT. I SEE AT LEAST A HALF DOZEN INITIATIVES TO KIND OF BRING BACK REDEVELOPMENT SOME FORM OR FASHION -- ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS THE E. R.. I. F. THESE WOULD YOU CREATED WITH A SENATE BILL. SIX TO EIGHT WE'VE GOT THE COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION INVESTMENT AUTHORITY WHICH WAS CREATED IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AUTHORITIES. THAT'S TWENTY SEVENTEEN NEIGHBORHOOD IN PHIL FINANCE IN TRANSIT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE SEAPORT INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND REVITALIZATION FINANCING DISTRICT FOR FORMER MILITARY BASES. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SO YOU GOT SO MANY EFFORTS GOING ON IN AND NOW YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER. ONE I WAS KIND OF COULD YOU TELL ME HOW THEY ALL. IN A RELATED. WELL MAYBE I COULD TALK YES THE PARK OR WHO'S. TRY TO PULL THE STUFF TOGETHER -- TO RESPOND. I THINK THE THE RESPONSE I'D GIVE TO THAT IS THAT ALL OF THE ITEMS YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE FORMS OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING BUT BUT ALL OF THEM SHARE THE COMMON CONSTRAINT THAT. THE FUNDING THAT CAN GO TO THEM. IS PURELY VOLUNTARY AND MAIN MAINLY BASED ON ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- SHARE AND THAT'S THAT'S WHEN THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THESE NEW TOOLS. IS THAT THE THE SHARE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE. JUST ISN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE A GO OF A MEANINGFUL -- WHAT IS REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY ISSUE BONDS AND FINANCE PROJECTS SO? THAT'S THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS BILL IT PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO INCREASE THE PULL OF FUNDING THAT WE GO TO THE TAX INCREMENT STREAM -- PUTS THE STATE AND IN CONTROL OF IT -- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RESPONSIBLE SO IT DEALS WITH SORT SORT OF THAT THAT MAIN ISSUE THAT ALL OF THOSE MECHANISMS YOU MENTION SHARE. WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE BILL -- IN THROUGH THE YOU KNOW ALL THE MATERIAL. IT SEEMS EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DID A LOT OF WORK AND MAYBE TRY TO ANSWER TOO MANY QUESTIONS ARE PERTINENT. SO MUCH BUT I I WAS CURIOUS WHY IS IT SUCH A SO MASSIVE. THE BILL IS NOT HOUSES IT'S TWO HUNDRED THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE IS THERE IS A A BUILD UP OVER TEN YEARS. FROM TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION AND REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS. WHEN IT WHEN THE THE LAST YEAR REDEVELOPMENT? SO IT BUILDS UP. TO A CAB IN THE BILL OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT I AM I REALLY SO IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT A YOU PUT INTO THIS BILL THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH RICHER YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IT JUST SEEMS SO. COMPLEX I UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR PHASING IT THE OUT OF ON OKAY I CAN GIVE YOU AN ANSWER IS SIMILAR TO WHAT IS SAID TO CENTER HERTZBERG. WE ARE VERY AWARE I AM PERSONALLY VERY AWARE. OF ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT REDEVELOPMENT -- HAD. WITH THERE'S A LOT OF STUDIES ON THIS. OUR REDEVELOPMENT WAS NOT GOOD IN TERMS OF RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENT I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF MISTAKES IT WAS. MONEY THAT SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT COULD HAVE BEEN USED IN A BETTER WAY MAYBE. PERHAPS IN TERMS OF AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO DEFINE OUR SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE -- YES AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE USED IT FOR WITH REDEVELOPMENT. THE HOUSING REQUIREMENT WAS ONLY THE MONEY IT REQUIRED THEM TO SET ASIDE THE MONEY. IN A LOT OF CITIES DID SET ASIDE THE MONEY BUT THEY NEVER SPENT. YOU KNOW THEY KEPT THOSE BOUNCES VERY HIGH. AND OUT OF THIS BILL DEALS WITH THE VERY THE REASON WHY. THIS BILL SOUNDS COMPLICATED IT REALLY ISN'T BUT IT DEALS WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT WORK WITH THAT WE WERE RECOGNIZED AND WITH LESSONS WE LEARNED. AND BAD REDEVELOPMENT FINANCING OF THE PAST. AND THAT'S WHAT I ANSWER TO SENATOR HERTZBERG HAS YET TRIED LOOKING FOR SOMETHING -- SO IT CREATES A ANSWER TO THE PROBLEMS. AT AN EVENT IF YOU REALIZE IT'S WE CAN'T JUST HAVE A SIMPLE BILL THAT ALLOWS REDEVELOPMENT. I DON'T I WOULD VOTE FOR IT MYSELF I THINK THAT WE THAT OCCURRED IN THE PAST I LIVE SO I HAD TO I HAD TO DO IT A DIFFERENT WAY. AND AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO IT NO A NEW WAY IN ORDER TO REFLECT HARD WORK AND SO I'M SORT OF POKING AND ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT CAN'T WE CAN'T GO BACK TO WHERE IT WAS. BUT STATE OVERSIGHT I'M GETTING A LITTLE CYNICAL ABOUT STATE OVERSIGHT. WE WILL GET. STATE AUDITOR REPORTS AND NOTHING HAPPENS WE HAVE ELLIE -- REPORTS NOTHING HAPPENS NOW THE ONLY OVERSIGHT I'M SEEING ON HOUSING IS I HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUING ONE OF MY CITIES. YEAH SO ARE THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH THE PARENT COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES -- COULD YOU HAD. TELL ME IN THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS WHAT YOU ENVISION AS STATE OVERSIGHT NOW IT'LL BE EFFECTIVE OTHER SOME VERY STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN THE BILL. IT HAS OTHER OVERSIGHT HAS AN APPROVAL PROCESS FIRST OF ALL THEY CAN'T DO IT UNLESS THE SUBMIT IT AND GET IT APPROVED THERE HAS TO BE A PLAN. THEY HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IT HAS TO BE FOR THE FIVE PURPOSES WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL. IT HAS TO HAVE FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROGRAM% ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF IT DOESN'T RELATE TO THE FIVE GOALS THAT WE HAVE. IN TERMS OF THE BILL IT WON'T GET APPROVED I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK AND RE WRITE IT. AND THEN ONCE IT'S APPROVE THERE'S AN ANNUAL REVIEW THERE'S AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT HAS TO BE SUBMITTED NOT ONLY TO THE COMMITTEE BUT TO US. THE LEGISLATURE THERE HAS TO BE -- A REVIEW OF THEIR PROGRESS READING THE THE PURPOSES OF OF THE PLAN THAT THEY SUBMITTED -- AND ALL THAT STUFF IS REVIEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I THINK IT IT PROVIDES. A VERY GOOD SET OF ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES -- FILLABLE FISCAL AND FROM A PROGRAM STANDPOINT. MISTER CITY MANAGER YOU'RE READY TO PUT UP WITH ALL THAT. YOU KNOW JUST THINKING THAT THAT THE IT REMINDS ME OF A MORE LIKE A GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS ANGELA ANNUALLY -- I THINK SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE MAKE -- THE NEW PROGRAMS WORK -- THIS WOULD. BE A GAME CHANGER POTENTIALLY SO. I THINK I'M READY TO RESTORE IT. ONE WAY THE MONEY EXPRESSES RUSHER SIN WHEN. WITH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS I HAVE A FEW -- BUT ONCE IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE ALL RIGHT [inaudible] SO. CENTRE BELL -- I WANT TO ECHO WHAT YOU HAD SAID THIS BILL HAS BEEN BASED IN EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY FROM. OUR REPRESENTATIVES BIG CITIES AND SMALL. RURAL COUNTIES AND URBAN. I AND ALL WALKS OF LIFE BUSINESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES. AND I THINK THAT -- REASON WHY WE'RE SEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT THIS IS BECAUSE THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WILL WORK FOR THEM. AND WHAT WE HEARD -- INCENTER MORLOCK WAS AT THIS SAME HEARING THE SAME JOINT HEARING LOSS ANGELES THAT THERE IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT IN A RICE -- ADDRESS CORRELATION IN A RISING STATE. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE ABSOLUTE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE OF THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE HOMES IS SEEN BETWEEN? TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THE MODERATE. LOW IN VERY LOW CATEGORIES WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THOSE BUILT WITHOUT AN ONGOING REVENUE SOURCE FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES I ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES WHEN IT COMES TO OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IN THIS BILL IS AT OR MANDATING THAT 50% 50%. OF ALL FINDING HAS TO GO TOWARDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM WHAT WE SAW. IN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF WHAT FOLKS CALLED REDEVELOPMENT SO WE GOT TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS IN THIS CRISIS. THE REASON WHY WE ADVANCE STATE OVERSIGHT IS BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST ARE THERE WERE A FEW NOT VERY MANY BUT THERE ARE A FEW BAD ACTORS. WHO GAME THE REDEVELOPMENT SYSTEM AND WE WANT TO BE A LEARN FROM THOSE PREVIOUS MISTAKES? THAT IS WHY WE'RE GONNA HAVE DIRECT STATE OVERSIGHT. OVER THESE FUNDS AND WHICH PROJECTS ARE GONNA BE APPROVED BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY NOT APPROVED -- AND IT'S ABOUT PUTTING SAFEGUARDS IN TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO GET THE JOB DONE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THERE ARE STRATEGIC OFF FRANCE WAS IN THAT BILL SO WHEN WE DO HIT A SIGNIFICANT RECESSION. IN A FISCAL EMERGENCY IS DECLARED -- THAT FINDING SO THAT WE'RE NOT -- IMPACTING -- PUBLIC EDUCATION BY THE WAY THAT'S THE LAST THING I THINK ANY OF US WANT TO DO AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M ANY MORE SPECIAL THAN ANYONE ELSE BUT MY WIFE IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL -- WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL MY LIFE FROM A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER -- AND MY GRANDFATHER WHO IS PASSING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL WOULD WHACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD -- AND AS WE SAW THERE IS AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BY LET'S SAY LANDLESS OFFICE THAT WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE PUT INTO THE BILL NOW -- THERE WILL NOT BE AGE -- IMPACT TO PUBLIC EDUCATION SCHOOL FUNDING BECAUSE OF THESE OFFERINGS THAT HAVE -- BEEN IN PLACE. THROUGH THE VARIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS BILL -- OF ALL IN IT WITH THIS IS THAT -- THIS THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THIS BILL BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. IN OUR PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN THE ENTIRE TIME IT'S NOT DO THIS FAST LET'S DO IT RIGHT. IS A WE HAVE BROUGHT IN FOLKS WHO OPPOSE REGARDING FOLKS WHO AGREE TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS -- IN THERE ARE A SINNER WINNER IS BEING A CHAMPION ON THIS INNER BALANCE BEEN A CHAMPION AND THIS IS BEING ABLE TO GET HOUSING BUILT FASTER AND TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING. TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILT. AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO CENTRE BELL FOR HE'S -- BEING A CHAMPION ON THIS ISSUE TO MY LEFT -- PETERSON WHO IS JUST -- I'VE BEEN ON ALL TECHNICAL DETAIL -- IN AT TIMES BUT OPINION IS I BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS AND I JUST DID NOT WANT -- TO MOVE AWAY. FROM JONATHAN YOU WANT TO SAY ALSO THANK YOU SUNSHINE WHO'S HERE FROM CENTER BELLS OFFICE. WHO KNOWS HOW TO CUSS AND GET THE JOB DONE SO -- I'LL TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR BATTLE -- FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS OKAY -- IT IS SIX THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS. THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND GOOD PAYING JOBS. TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LABOR INCOME. SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. AND IMPORTANTLY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THIS BILL WILL HAVE A POSITIVE NET IMPACT. IT WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON LEVY IN OUR HOUSING CRISIS. HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE STATE ECONOMY. IT'LL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ELIMINATING POVERTY. IT WILL HELP AREAS THAT HAVE A LARGE. POVERTY IN THEIR AREA. AND IT WILL HELP LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. NET IN INTERNATIONAL TAX REVENUES IF OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

TWO OH FIVE CENTER HERTZ BERGEN WANTS A THANK YOU CENTER HER ALONG WITH YOUR WITNESS IS UP FOR YOUR PATIENCE THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I START WITH THE ACCEPTING BOTH OF THEM POSED AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE BOMB. AS YOU CORRECTLY NOTED THIS IS YET ANOTHER HERTZBERG STORM WATER BILL. AT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE'VE GOVERNMENT WHERE IT'S SO I CALLED THE RIGHT HAND LEFT HAND ISSUE. WHEN YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO'S? IN CALIFORNIA YOUR SUBJECT IT WILL BE A LIVE TEST CITY LAWS TO COUNTY LAWS TO STATE LAWS THE FEDERAL LAWS. AND OFTEN WE THE LEFT HAND IS NO THE RIGHT HANDS DOING. AND WE'RE CREATING ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS AND STORMS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMES ALONG AND SAYS OKAY WE'RE PASSING UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT. THIS REQUIREMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATIONS OUR SYSTEM PERMIT WHICH NPDES PERMIT. BASICALLY SAYS YOU GOT STORM WATER IN ESSENCE IT RUNS OFF IT IT PUTS JUNKIN THE OCEAN AND YOU GOT TO GET A PERMIT IF YOU'RE. IF YOU'RE ONE OF THESE ENTITIES THAT HAVE A BUSINESS THAT GETS QUALIFIED IN THE SITUATION -- THAT THE DOES THAT THEN YOU HAVE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THAT IT IS REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL LAW AND WHAT DOES IT DO. IT THEN COMES UP WITH THESE GENERAL PERMIT FOR STORM WATER DISCHARGE AND IT'S CALLED AN INDUSTRIAL GENERAL PERMIT IGP CARPET ON TOP OF PERMANENT TOP A PERMIT. WITH THE STAGE JUST SIMPLY IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING THAT ACROSS THE BOARD EVERYBODY AGREES WITH. AND THEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE BEEN FACING IN THE LEGISLATURE UNBELIEVABLE ANGST. BECAUSE UNDER THE STATE WATER PERMIT SYSTEM WHERE STUFFED RUNS OFF THE STREETS OR RUNS OUT OF BUSINESS AND STUFF CITIES CAN NOW BE HELD LIABLE IN THEIR SUBJECT AND COUNTIES LIABLE. BECAUSE THEY COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FINES. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT EACH PRETTY SIMPLE IT SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE ONE OF THESE COMPANIES AND ONLY ABOUT. 20% IT APPEARS THAT ARISE THAT REQUIRES NEEDS ONE OF THESE PERMITS WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A BUSINESS LICENSE OR RENEWAL OF THE BUSINESS LICENSE WE'VE NOW GIVEN. NINETY THREE MONTHS THE REPRIEVE ON THAT. YOU BASICALLY GOT ON THE FORM PUT IN YOUR NUMBERS FOR YOUR PERMITS AND WE'VE ASKED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS YOU JUST TWO THINGS ONE EXCEPT A DOCUMENT THE SIDES OF THE NAME OF THE LIKE OF THE BUSINESS UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY AND TO GO TO THE WEBSITE WHICH WE NOW REQUIRE. AND LOOK FOR THE CODE AND FIND IF THEY QUALIFY. THE EFFECT OF THAT IF YOU JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE BUSINESSES BUT THINK ABOUT THE CITY OR THE COUNTY NOW YES THEY ARGUE THERE'S A COUPLE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE PERMITS. OKAY WE'RE SOLVING 98% OF THE PROBLEMS AND YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE SITUATION IN MOST CITIES DO AND ALL THESE PERMITS ARE REQUIRED IN CITIES. BUT THE REALITY IS WITH A COUPLE MORE LINES YOU KNOW INTEGRATED STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL SITUATIONS. AND YOU KNOW JOKE AROUND WITH MY STAFF AND IF THE BUT YOU KNOW IF THERE COULD BE AN ARGUMENT WELL JUST A SHOULDN'T HAVE IT BE A BURDEN TO A CITY OR COUNTY. TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A FEDERAL LAW ONE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA HAD TO WEAR BLUE SHIRTS IT MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT. BUT THIS IS A LAW THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO LIABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY'RE HAVING A BIG HEART ATTACK OVER SO IT SEEMS TO ME YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS GET THE ARGUMENTS. THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR A LONG TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- IT'S A NEW COST ALL WHAT'S NEW BURDEN BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH TO ME. THE BENEFIT OF THIS THING AND THE REASON IT MAKES SENSE LAWS. AT THE FRONT END OF A PERMIT AGAIN NOT A FOUR COUNTIES THEY DON'T HAVE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS LICENSES. BUT BUT MOST WITH EVERYBODY ELSE WE HAVE AND SECONDLY WE'VE WE'VE BASICALLY DEALT WITH A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM THAT ALSO AFFECTS THE LIABILITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. SO THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES A RICKY DID ESSENCE REQUIRES THOSE THINGS IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IN IN ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. AND QUITE FRANKLY PRETTY EFFECTIVE I THINK IN TRYING TO THINK THROUGH GOVERNMENT IN A WAY THAT INTEGRATES THESE VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICIES AT EVERY LEVEL. AND I WOULD WRECK I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS X. THINGS RICK CELEBRATING AT THE RATE THEY ARE. AND WE IN GOVERNMENT ARE NOT AS EXHILARATING AS QUICKLY IS TO TRY TO CREATE THE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THE BUSINESSES WHATEVER. EASIER WE SEE ALL THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY DOING THAT THIS IS A PLACE WHERE. SOMEBODY MIGHT NOT NEED NO THEY NEED THE PERMIT RIGHT AND THEN THE GAULS AND SOMEBODY COMES AFTER IN LOS ANGELES IS ONLY. FIVE INVESTIGATORS FOR WHAT. SIXTY THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND PERMITS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT EITHER I HAVE IN MY NOTES BUT WITH WINDOWS. ANY EVENT. THE POINT IS THAT IT MAKES IT EVEN EASIER IN MY JUDGMENT IS MUCH AS WE CAN INTEGRATE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND PARTICULARLY ONE LIKE THIS. THAT'S SO IMPORTANT AND AS SUCH IMPACT ON ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED WITH THAT. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND WE'VE GOT TWO VERY BRILLIANT WITH THIS IS HERE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COAST KEEPERS AND ALSO LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE. FOR THE METALS COALITION BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUPPORT LETTERS HERE YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF FOLKS WHO REALLY RESPONSIBLE THE AUTO DISMANTLE THERE'S METAL PEOPLE AND STUFF THAT ARE COMPLYING. AND THEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF THEIR COMPETITORS WHO ARE COMPLYING SHOULD WE NOT AS A GOVERNMENT REWARD PEOPLE AND LET THEM YOU KNOW BECAUSE THESE CHALLENGES WHERE YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE HOST OF RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING THE JOB. AND HELPING PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT I DON'T WANT TO START WITH. YEAH MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SINNERS PARK POLICE FORCE GEORGE YOUR MINUTES SIR -- GOOD MORNING CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS OMITTING SOME OF ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE KEEP RELIANCE ON ONLY TWO POINTS AND AND ONE CLARIFYING POINT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK FROM THE OUTSET. THIS BILL IS NOT REQUIRING CITIES OR COUNTIES. TO CONFIRM THAT PARTIES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PERMIT THE PERMIT REQUIRES BEING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS DOING BMPS BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS REQUIRING IT IS ONLY REQUIRING THE CITIES OR COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO ENROLL UNDER THE PERMIT OR AND ROLLING UNDER THE PERMIT THAT IS THE ONLY OBLIGATION WITH THIS BILL -- SECOND I JUST WANT TO ILLUSTRATE WHY THIS BILL IS IS IS REALLY SOME POINTS AND SO HURT DID A GREAT JOB -- SO WHEN A RIVER BECOMES OUR WATER WAY BECOMES TOO POLLUTED -- THE REGIONAL BOARDS SET WHAT'S CALLED A TOTAL DAILY MAXIMUM LOAD A TMDL WITH THEM THE REGIONAL BOARD WILL DO IS ASSESS WHAT IS THE LIMIT OF THE AMOUNT OF LET'S JUST SAY METALS. WE CAN PUT IN THE RIVER -- WITHOUT IMPAIRING IT AND SO WE COME UP WITH THAT LOAD LIMIT AND THEY FIGURE OUT EVERYONE IN THE WATERSHED THAT IS WORSE THAT IS DISCHARGING INTO THAT RIVER SO LET'S TAKE A LATE -- THEY'VE A METALS TEAM DEAL. SO THEY SETTLE A LOAD TARGET AND THEN THEY FIGURE OUT EVERYONE THIS THIS CHARGING IN THERE AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE LIABLE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING THAT TARGET. BUT IT'S UNDER HURTS BERG SAID ONLY ONE OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE -- FACILITIES ARE UNDER THE PERMIT TWENTY BILLY AND ARE PAYING THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE -- TO COMPLY WITH THIS PERMIT WHICH JUST CREATES AN INEQUITABLE SITUATION BUT ALSO WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THE WATER WAYS TO MEET THAT LOW TARGET IF 80% OF THE IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER THE THE PERMIT. DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER THE PERMIT OR DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED -- TO PUT IN THESE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO MEET THESE LOW TARGETS AND SO WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS US A SIMPLE SOLUTION BUT AN ELEGANT WAY TO GET FOLKS TO COME UNDER THE PERMIT -- YOU KNOW ONLY TWENTY ONE OUT OF FIVE FOLKS -- THAT THAT'S A BIG CONTRAST AND WE NEED TO GET FOLKS ENROLLED IN THIS AND SO FOR THAT I ANSWER. THANK. WHAT IS STILL HERE? THANK YOU SENATOR IN COMMITTEE LAURIE KAMMERER TODAY I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA METALS COALITION -- THE C. M. C. -- IS HOME TO ABOUT -- FOUR THOUSAND WORKERS IN THE METAL -- INDUSTRY AND THE ADVANCED MEDICAL. MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY -- THE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS INVOLVED IN -- THE METAL -- THE INDUSTRY AND THE NON FILER ISSUE IS AN ISSUE IT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE -- THE SMALL BUSINESSES MOST OF THESE METAL COMPANIES ARE SMALL BUSINESSES FAMILY OWNED. AND RUN AND THEY HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST THOSE COMPANIES WHO ARE NOT FILING WHEN THEY HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE LAW -- SECONDLY THE WHEN THE RUN OFF GOES FROM A NON FILER TO A FILER. THE FILER IS LIABLE AND THE FILER IS THEN LIABLE FOR ANY PENALTIES OR ANYTHING THAT THAT COMES AT AS A RESULT OF THE RUN ON AND THE THIRD POINT I WAS GOING TO RAISE IS THAT THE COST OF THE PERMIT -- ISN'T AS AN ADDED COST TO THE BUSINESS AND IT PUTS THE FILER -- AT A COMPETITIVE. DISADVANTAGE AS I MENTIONED SO FOR THOSE REASONS THE CALIFORNIA METALS COALITION STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE SPELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE HAD TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR THE EXCUSE ME COMMENTS SIR PLEASE. MISSION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. ONLY GOOD FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT IN TERMS OF IMPORTANT WORK WE NEED TO DO THERE BUT ALSO LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THE GOOD ACTORS THAT ARE COMPLYING WITH THESE PROGRAMS HAVE PERMITS HAVE A PLAN. AND WE'RE IN COMPETITION WITH FOLKS THAT DON'T AND IN SOME INSTANCES A SENATOR POINTED OUT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A PERMIT. A STORM WATER PERMITS THE THROUGH THIS PROCESS WHICH IS REALLY SMART IT WILL CATCH THOSE FOLKS AND HELP BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE AND LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR THE GOOD ACTORS. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH AS MAKE YOU PAY FOR YOUR HERE THANK YOU THAT COULD OPEN UP FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT FOR SOME CLASSES WAS ORGANIZATION GOVERNMENT PLAN AGAIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE WEST COAST CHAPTER FOR THE INSTITUTE. RECYCLING INDUSTRIES IN SPORT IT'S BEEN FUN AGAIN. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THREE SEPARATE EVENTS ON BEHALF OF SURFRIDER IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT THANKS FOR BEING HERE. MORNING. MORNING NANCY SHOWED SOME HAVE A FEEL OF A STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD. NOW I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE. PLEASE IF YOU ARE IF YOU DON'T I CAN AFFORD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THE MORNING. THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE DO HAVE A CONCERNS POSITION ON THE BILL WERE SORT OF A TWEENER ON THIS -- ONE AND WE DO REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE A CENTER HERTZ BIRD OUTLINED A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FACE WE'RE TRYING TO COMPLY WITH OUR OWN MUNICIPAL STORM WATER PERMITS. REALLY APPRECIATE HIS WORK ON S. B. TWO THIRTY ONE AND ALL THE OTHER ATTENTION HE'S GIVEN THIS ISSUE AS IT IS A HUGE CHALLENGE. CHALLENGE FOR US -- THE BILL AS DRAFTED DOES PRESENT A COUPLE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES FOR COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR THAT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE -- FIRST AS WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE NO QUITE A FEW THERE'S ABOUT SIXTEEN SO A THIRD OF THE STATE IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREA DOESN'T HAVE. A CURRENT BUSINESS LICENSE SO THEY WOULDN'T FALL. UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL IN ADDITION THERE ARE NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTIES THAT WE ONLY REQUIRE A BUSINESS LICENSE FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES -- THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER INCLUDING INCLUDING -- CARD ROOMS OR OR THE PARTY SCENE AND BUYING OF FIREARMS FOR EXAMPLE -- SO A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT MIGHT NOT FALL UNDER THE INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT. I AND THEN FINALLY THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF COUNTIES -- THAT HAVE AID MUNICIPAL -- EXCUSE ME A MINISTERIAL PROCESS TO ISSUE A BUSINESS LICENSE AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN OVER THE COUNTER PROCESS AS YOU ALL KNOW BUT COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT REQUIRES THE BUSINESS TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. SUBMIT A FEE -- AND PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE PAPERWORK AND THAT COUNTY THEN -- ISSUES THE PERMIT SO THAT WE DO -- WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO STAFF A AND YOUR YOUR COMMITTEE FOLKS AND REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR EFFORTS -- WE DO THINK THAT THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED IT WOULD CHANGE THAT MINISTERIAL PROCESS AND IT REQUIRES TO ROUTE THAT PERMIT TO AN APPROPRIATE STAFF PERSON THAT COULD THEN. VERIFY -- WE WOULD THIS DEMONSTRATING COMPLIANCE BY SHOWING THAT -- THEY'RE APPROPRIATE PAPERWORK DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY HAVE THAT PERMANENT -- IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THAT MEANT MINISTERIAL PROCESS IN PLACE AND NOT REALLY GOES AND SPEAKS TO SORT OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WITHIN A JURISDICTION. THIS STATE -- INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT MIGHT NOT BE THE ONLY STATE PERMIT THESE BUSINESSES NAME WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS IS THE ONLY THING. THE ONE STOP SHOP FOR A BUSINESS LICENSE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT ALSO NEED ADITIONAL PERMANENCE -- FROM. OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTION JURISDICTIONS AS WELL DEPENDING ON THE BUSINESS SO IT'S JUST A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT FOR US AND DOESN'T QUITE CAPTURE -- FROM A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE AS IS MENTIONED IN THE BILL IT'S OF STATEWIDE CONCERN OBVIOUSLY -- BUT IT REALLY ONLY AFFECTS A SUBSET OF BUSINESSES IN A SUBSET OF COUNTIES FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- BUT AGAIN APPRECIATE THE WORK OF STAFF AND OF COURSE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL TOGETHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GRANDFATHER WERE RECEIVED SECOND HAVE YOU HOLD IF YOU DON'T MIND IT'S RIGHT THERE LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE IS IN A POSITION IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE AT THIS TIME. LAST CALL ON OPPOSITION. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE OF ACTIVATED HAS SENT HURTS FOR BETTER DRESSES -- ANY ISSUES AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND HURTS. FOR YEAH ON PAGE THREE OF THE MEASURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE ON THIRTY SEVEN IS IS ON APPLYING TO A COUNTY. FOR INITIAL BUSINESS LICENSE WELL IF THERE IS IF THEY HAD ALL DIFFERENT IBEATS BY OPERATIONAL LAW IT SEEMS TO ME IF THERE'S NO LICENSE THERE BE NO REQUIREMENT BUT IF IF YOU NEED ALSO SUSPENDERS CLARIFY THAT. THAT'S A REASONABLE SOLUTION -- IF IT'S NEEDED I I DON'T REALLY THINK SO BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT IF YOU SAY I WOULD NEED TO APPLY. FOR A LICENSE IN MY COMMUNITY FOR MINOR -- SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THIS THIS ISSUE WOW WHEN YOU TRY TO CHANGE THINGS. IF THE ARGUMENT IS WELL YOU KNOW YOU YOU'VE GOT ONE COME COMPLIANCE FOR A COUNTY DOES IT MEAN THAT THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING ELSE WELL WHERE DO YOU START. DO YOU DO YOU HAVE TO THEN GIVE LEGAL ADVICE YOU CAN JUST SIMPLY HAVE A DISCLAIMER YOUR FORM OF THIS IS ONE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GUARANTEE YOU COUNTY COUNCIL WAS A CITY ATTORNEYS WILL REQUIRE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST GOOD LAWYERING OF WHAT YOU'D OTHERWISE SAY BUT IS THAT AN ARGUMENT. TO SAY WELL YOU DON'T TAKE A FIRST STEP TO MAKE THINGS BETTER THE POINT THAT WAS MADE THIS IS BEING AN ELEGANT SOLUTION WHERE IT HAS. BOTH IMPLICATION FOR OTHER PEOPLE ARE COMPLYING WITH THEIR SHARING THE OBLIGATION AND ALSO FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE THE OBLIGATION SO. YOU KNOW I'VE CLEARLY WE'RE OPEN TO FIX ANY MEANINGFUL OR WILLING -- TO TO WORK WITH ANY WAS THE FIRST COMMITTEE SO APPRECIATED% WE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOUR COMMITTEE ASKED IN THE THREE MONTHS AND THE CLARIFICATION YOU ASK FOR WHICH I THINK WE'RE RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SINNERS BERGEN YES THE THE THE WAY THE COMMITTEE READS IT ARE THOSE COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A BUSINESS LICENSE THIS WILL NOT THERE WILL NOT BE TRIGGER SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AS IN HERDS BERG ON THAT I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE CLARIFICATION WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. PLEASE ENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MR JR. A FORMER MEMBER OF THE SACK LIKE TO FOLLOW UP. WE WE HAD A COASTAL COUNTIES COCKE IS DO YOU STILL HAVE IT. WOULD IT WOULD JUST APPLY TO THOSE COUNTIES. NO IT UP IN THE AIR ALL FIFTY EIGHT HAS A BUSINESS LICENSE OKAY OKAY SO THEN I'M NARROWING IT DOWN TO SPECIFIC COUNTIES DOESN'T. PROVIDE THE SOLUTION WHO CENTERS REQUIRE WE FEELING COMPELLED TO HELP OUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN THIS REGARD OTHER THAN. WE GOT SOME BUSINESSES THAT ARE. COMPLYING OTHERS THAT ARE YOU WERE TRYING TO AVOID NOT HELPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORK WHO IS IS IF THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN. ADOPTED AND ENFORCED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD REGIONAL BY THE STATE AND THEN TO THE NINE REGIONS. OF THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD AND SO OUR COMMUNITIES WE GET FIND BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON NPDES PERMITS. THROUGH A HELPING ABOUT WE'RE HELPING OUT THE THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE GETTING FINED. WE'RE HELPING OUT THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE THAT ARE GETTING FINED BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE POLLUTION ARE DOING IT. WE'RE HELPING OUT MUNICIPALITIES AND COUNTIES WHO OTHERWISE GET FINED BECAUSE OF THE THE THE CONTRIBUTION THESE POLLUTANTS AND TORE A WATER STREAMS WITH NOT JUST OCEAN BUT ALSO YOU KNOW RIVERS AND THE LIKE. AND IT WILL HELP OUT THE HEALTH OF THE OF OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WHO HAVE TO DRINK WATER THAT GETS POLLUTED FROM THIS THIS RUN OFF. SO I WOULDN'T SUGGEST THAT WE'RE JUST DOING THIS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S REALLY FOR THE FOLKS HERE BUSINESS FOLKS AND PEOPLE IN QUALITY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THRESHERS CENTERVILLE -- IN TERMS OF FINES AND THAT WHOLE PROCESS TO ENFORCE THE FEDERAL LAW -- DONE INVOLVES A LOT OF ATTORNEYS COST OVERHEAD. AND AND WITH THIS REDUCE THAT OR MAKE IT LESS LIKELY. THAT THAT KIND OF PROCESS -- WOULD EXIST. THEREFORE THEREFORE MEANING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ATTORNEYS ANYMORE. IS THAT IS THAT -- I CAN I JUST TAKE THAT PERSONALLY AT ABOUT A READ THAT I JUST WANT. IF YOU WERE TO REDUCE THE GOVERNMENTAL COSTS. TO WOULD YOU -- COMMENT ON THAT WELL TAKE THE FIRST PART ON BUDGETARY NEEDS BUT I DO THINK IT REDUCED GOVERNMENTAL COSTS DOWN BOTH IN TERMS OF FINES AND AT AND THE LIKE AND THAT'S H. A BROADER COMPLIANCE BY ALL PARTIES TO THE SYSTEM WORKS. THIS SITE WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL SAN JOSE IT WAS LIKE. ALL THE TIME AND LITIGATION -- YOU KNOW JUST CONSTANT ON GOING KIND OF SITUATIONS [inaudible] AND IS THERE ANY CONTROL IS IT WHEN YOU DO A FINE IS THERE ANY SPECIFICATION. OF WHERE THAT FINE MONEY GOES. WHERE IS THAT MONEY GO I MEAN WHEN THERE'S YET IT DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF OF THE PENALTY IN THE FINE -- IT IN MANY CASES -- THEY'RE CALLED SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS WHERE WHERE THEY GO BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY TO HELP -- LEAVE WHATEVER -- THE POLLUTION WAS BEING CAUSED -- SOMETIMES IT'S JUST AN IN ADMINISTRATIVE FINE -- THE STATE WATER BOARD JUST ASSESS THAT AND PUT THT BACK INTO THEIR THEIR STORE WATER% PROGRAM USUALLY INTO THEIR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM SO I I I FIND -- THE SYSTEM WHERE EVERYTHING IS DONE THROUGH FINDS IS. IS A BAD THING IN GOVERNMENT AS A GOVERNMENTAL RULE I MEAN. YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S WARRIOR TOWARDS JUST. MAKING PEOPLE DO THINGS BY FINE SETS. JEREMY YOU WANT YOU WANT REGULATIONS THAT. ENFORCE REGULATIONS BUT THROUGH LICENSING PROCESS IS BETTER. IS IS IT WOULD YOU IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL EXACTLY IT JUST TO TRY TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK AND BECOME SELF. EXECUTORY SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE SYSTEMS GOOD GOVERNMENT ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN WORK ON AUTOMATIC PILOT LIKE THIS THAT HAVE A GOOD EASY. CONSUMER INTERFACE WHEN PEOPLE ARE WORK IT AREN'T FRUSTRATING AND THAT SOLVE PROBLEMS WAY IN ADVANCE SO YEAH EXACTLY RIGHT I THINK IT'S LIKE I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT IN THOSE TERMS CENTER BUT I THINK THAT'S A VERY INSIGHTFUL CRISIS THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY. YOU KNOW AND AND YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN WE FIRST WE GOT FINED FOR VARIOUS THINGS ON WATER ISSUES. THERE WAS NO CONTROL WHERE THE MONEY WENT I WENT TO A A FINE BOOK AND THEN THE FINE BOOK IT WAS USED BY. SOME ENTITY FOR WHATEVER. ON REGULATED PURPOSE THEY WANTED TO USE THE MONEY. FOR THAT'S BAD GOVERNMENT I THINK I THINK THAT'S MONEY WASTED OR NOT WASTED BUT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE SPENDING THE MONEY THERE'S NO RULES PLAYERS. YOU KNOW -- AND I THINK THAT'S THE MONEY SHOULD BE USED TO CLEAN THE WATER. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO WHEN DONE AS PURPLE SO THEY DON'T LOSE THE FIRST PLACES WERE CATCHING HIM IN SOLVING THE PROBLEM. IN THE FIRST PLACE WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE BUT THAT'S GOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEARCH FOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.% AS RELIABLE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK THE THE NOTION IS ELEGANT SOLUTION AND I LIKE THE THIS KIND OF THINKING -- IT'S A GOOD WAY -- TO TO TO OPERATE GOVERNMENT BETTER THAN FINDS BETTER THAN PUTTING THE BURDEN ON THE COMPLY OUR AND CERTAINLY -- IS IN THE INTEREST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
