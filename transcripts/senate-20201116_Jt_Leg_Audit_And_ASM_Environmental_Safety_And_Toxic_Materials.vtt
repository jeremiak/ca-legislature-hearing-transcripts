TO THIRTY TWO HUNDRED

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:45.350

BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:51.256
TWENTY ONE. BUT BASED ON THEIR

THAT HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:12.210
LEAD. CONTAMINATION THAT WE

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:13.411
BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:14.179
HAVE PRIORITIZED IN THESE

00:30:18.783 --> 00:30:20.118
FOUND WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:22.120
AUDIT EARLIER THIS YEAR. THERE

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:23.621
WERE THIRTY ONE OF THOSE FIFTY

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.089
PROPERTIES THAT HAVE NOT YET

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.958
BEEN CLEANED UP- MOST OF THEM

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:29.027
BEING CHILD CARE CENTERS TWENTY

PARKS. AND TWO SCHOOLS ALSO

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:34.132
THOSE FACILITIES ARE THOSE

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:36.467
SITES ACTUALLY ARE STILL NEED

00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:39.103
TO BE CLEANED UP. AND THE LEAD

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.471
CONTAMINATION TO BE REMOVED AND

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:42.273
AS YOU ARE YOU KNOW CONCERNED

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.375
EYES. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT RISK

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:46.110
TO. NOT ONLY ADULTS BUT

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:48.346
CHILDREN WHO FREQUENTLY CHILD

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:49.547
CARE CENTERS AND THE PARKS AND

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:52.483
CERTAINLY THE SCHOOLS ARE WHEN

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.985
KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL- THE

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:55.353
DEPARTMENT HASN'T YOU KNOW THE

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.521
REASON THEY'RE BEHIND I

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:58.223
APOLOGIZE FOR MY MASK PLAYING.

00:30:58.289 --> 00:31:01.292
UP THE REASON THEY'RE BEHIND IN.

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.261
NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:04.229
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED SITES TO

00:31:04.295 --> 00:31:04.829
GETTING THOSE CLEANED UP BY

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:06.531
JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY

00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:08.466
ACTUALLY HAD ESTIMATED THE PACE

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.768
OF CLEANUP WOULD BE. BETWEEN

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:11.636
TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FIVE

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.104
PROPERTIES PER WEEK AND THEY

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:14.372
HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED THAT THEY

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:17.041
HIREDTO CONTRACTORS- AND

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.076
NEITHER OF THOSE CONTRACTORS

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:19.644
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THAT

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:22.380
CASE OF CLEANUP. AND EIGHT ONE

00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:23.414
OF THE CONTRACTORS THEY

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:26.751
ACTUALLY- DECIDED TO HAVE THAT

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.086
CONTRACTOR STOP CLEANING UP

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:29.654
PROPERTIES BECAUSE THEY THEY

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:31.256
COST OVERRUNS WERE JUST TOO

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:33.157
SIGNIFICANT FOR THEM. I TO

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:34.325
CONTINUE TO USE THAT

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.894
CONTRACTORS SO THE PACE HAS HAS

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:39.264
DIMINISHED SIGNIFICANTLY- EVEN

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.698
THOUGH THEY ESTIMATED THE PACE

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:42.100
TO BE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.168
FIVE. WE LOOKED AT A TIME FRAME

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:45.403
PRIOR TO COPE IT BECAUSE

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.771
CERTAINLY COVERED HAS HAD AN

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:48.373
ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:49.941
TO CLEAN PROPERTIES BUT WE

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:52.010
LOOKED AT A TIME FRAME OF MARCH

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.077
TWENTY NINETEEN TWO FEBRUARY

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.479
TWENTY TWENTY. TO SEE WHAT THE

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.781
PACE WISE AND THE PACE WAS

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:57.915
ACTUALLY ABOUT TWENTY

00:31:57.982 --> 00:31:58.883
PROPERTIES PER WEEK SO

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:02.353
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:02.887
TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:03.488
PROPERTIES THEY WERE EXPECTING

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:05.189
WOULD BE CLEANED UP. DURING THE

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:07.025
COURSE OF THIS. CLEAN UP

00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:10.795
PROJECT AT THE PACE OF TWENTY

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:11.296
FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE THEY

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:11.896
THOUGHT THEY'D HAVE A CLEANED

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:13.631
UP BY- DECEMBER OF TWENTY

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:15.099
TWENTY ONE BUT THAT IS- WELL

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.368
ACTUALLY BY JUNE SO IF THEY

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:18.870
STICK WITH THE TWENTY

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.805
PROPERTIES PER WEEK. THEY WILL

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:21.906
HAVE EVERYTHING CLEANED UP OF

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.675
THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED BY

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.209
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:28.112
BUT BECAUSE THEY- HAD A CEASE

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:29.380
AND DESIST BASICALLY WOULD WANT

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:31.049
TO CONTRACTORS THE PACE NOW IS

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:32.717
EVEN DROP DOWN EVEN FURTHER

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.652
IT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN PROPERTIES.

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:36.921
PER WEEK AND NOW THAT PUSHES

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:40.091
THE CLEAN UP COMPLETION OF THE

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:41.025
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:43.761
OUT TO. TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO

00:32:43.828 --> 00:32:45.697
THINGS ARE GETTING PUSHED OUT

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:46.331
FURTHER AND FURTHER BECAUSE OF

00:32:46.397 --> 00:32:48.099
THE PACE- JUST NOT

00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:49.600
ACCOMPLISHING WHAT THE

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:50.601
DEPARTMENT HAD ORIGINALLY

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:52.904
EXPECTED WHEN THEY- THEY ARE

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:57.442
IDENTIFIED. ALL THE PROPERTIES

00:32:57.508 --> 00:32:58.042
THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED UP.

00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:58.943
SO THAT'S A SIX. COMES NOW WHY

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.211
IS THIS HAPPENING I MENTION ONE

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:02.513
THING WHERE- THEY HAD TO HAVE

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.048
ONE CONTRACTOR BASICALLY CEASE

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.117
AND DESIST WORK. ON THE OTHER

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.286
ISSUE IS THEY DIDN'T. ENFORCE

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:09.654
CERTAIN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:10.888
THAT WERE IN THE CONTRACTS AS

00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:13.758
FAR AS PASTE. UP FOR CLEAN UP.

00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.326
SO THAT THOSE WERE A COUPLE OF

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.528
CONCERNS THAT WE IDENTIFIED-

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.463
THAT SINGS OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:19.964
COULD HAVE. AND PERHAPS SHOULD

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.766
HAVE BEEN DOING. THROUGHOUT THE

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.402
COURSE OF THE CLEAN UP THAT'S

00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:26.237
BEEN OCCURRING THUS FAR. WE

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:28.272
ALSO IDENTIFIED IN THE

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.007
DEPARTMENT KNOWS THIS THERE'S

00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:31.275
FORTY SIX HUNDRED. ADDITIONAL

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.077
PROPERTIES. ARE THAT NEED TO BE

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:34.946
CLEANED UP THEY'RE NOT AS

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:37.181
CONTAMINATED AS A THIRTY TWO

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:38.149
HUNDRED BUT THEY STILL HAVE

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.084
SIGNIFICANT CONTAMINATION- AND

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:41.285
THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE A

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:42.887
STRATEGY OR A TIMELINE FOR

00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:44.956
THERE'S FORTY SIX HUNDRED

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:46.290
PROPERTIES. SO THAT AGAIN.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.959
SKEWS ME THAT'S- THAT'S

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:49.427
INFORMATION THAT- THE

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:51.229
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND

00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:53.297
WELL ONCE WE GET THE THIRTY TWO

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:54.432
HUNDRED CLEANED UP. DO WE HAVE

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:56.067
A STRATEGY OR TIMELINE FOR

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.635
THESE OTHER FORTY SIX HUNDRED

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:58.836
PROPERTIES THAT CONTAIN

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:00.838
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF LEAD

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:03.040
CONTAMINATION. SO WE MADE A FEW

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:04.742
RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:07.111
THE SCHEDULING. FIRST WE FELT

00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:08.146
THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEED TO

00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:10.214
IMMEDIATELY SOLICITA CONTRACTOR

00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:11.349
TO WORK ON THOSE THIRTY ONE

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:12.683
PROPERTIES DOES CHILD CARE

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.420
CENTERS THE SCHOOLS AND THOSE

00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:17.889
PARKS THEY NEED TO GET THOSE-

00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:19.157
SITES CLEANED UP AS SOON AS

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:21.959
POSSIBLE AND THERE IS A- A

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:23.861
PROCESS THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:26.397
USE. IT'S CALLED TIME CRITICAL

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:28.466
REMOVAL ACTION TO CRA AND

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:30.735
THAT'S ACTUALLY AN EXPEDITED

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:31.302
PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT COULD

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:34.105
USE. TO GET THOSE THIRTY ONE

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:36.274
SITES CLEANED UP- MORE MORE

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.809
QUICKLY THAN THAN HAS HAPPENED

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.143
IN THE PAST SO THAT'S ONE

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.645
RECOMMENDATION. ANOTHER

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:41.746
RECOMMENDATION IS OF COURSE

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:43.481
THEY NEED TO IMMEDIATELY

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:45.750
SOLICIT ADDITIONAL CONTRACTORS

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:46.717
TO ASSIST IN THE CLEANUP

00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:48.219
BECAUSE ONE CONTRACTOR IS JUST

00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:49.220
NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH THAT

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:50.922
PUSHES THE TIMELINE WAY TOO FAR

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.990
OUT AND CONTINUES TO EXPOSE

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:55.660
PEOPLE TO RISK OF LEAD

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.595
POISONING. SO THEY NEED TO ACT

TO GET ADDITIONAL CONTRACTORS

00:34:58.896 --> 00:35:00.898

THEY HOLD THE CONTRACTORS TO

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:09.140
THOSE STANDARDS. AND THEN THE

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:10.608
LAST- RECOMMENDATION RELATED

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:13.678
TO. THE PACE OF CLEANUP WOULD

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:16.347
BE BY SPRING OF NEXT YEAR TO

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:17.515
REALLY GET TOGETHER

00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:21.018

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:23.421
EXPECTATIONS OF THE THIRTY TWO

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:24.722

UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE NEXT STEPS

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:34.131
AND WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS AS

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.900
FAR AS CLEANING UP. THE

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.235
CONTAMINATED SITES IN SOUTHERN

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.470
CALIFORNIA. THIS INFORMATION

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:40.638
NEEDS TO BE POSTED ON OUR

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:42.073
WEBSITE AND WE BELIEVE IT

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:43.708
SHOULD BE UPDATED AT A MINIMUM

00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:46.410
EVERY SIX MONTHS FOR THE PUBLIC

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.781
THE SECOND MAIN SECTION OF THE

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.683
ART REPORT IS RELATED TO COST-

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.719
AS MEMBERS ARE I'M SURE WELL

AWARE THE LEGISLATURE. ARE

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:57.455
PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:35:57.522 --> 00:35:59.323
OF MONEY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY

00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.824
MILLION DOLLARS TO THE

00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:01.726
DEPARTMENT. TO CLEAN UP WHAT

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:02.627
THE DEPARTMENT SOUGHT THEY

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:03.995
WOULD ACCOMPLISH WOULD BE ABLE

00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:05.329
TO CLEAN UP THOSE THIRTY TWO

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:06.931
HUNDRED SITES WITH THAT TWO

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.165
HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS.

00:36:08.232 --> 00:36:10.601
HOWEVER IN LOOKING AT THE COST

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:12.703
US FAR AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.373
EXPANDING TO CLEAN SITES ARE

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:17.141
THAT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:19.143
DOLLARS IS GOING TO FALL SHORT.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.378
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:22.580
A- TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE OUT

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:23.981
OF THOSE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED

00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:25.216
PROPERTIES THAT WILL NOT BE

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:27.251
ABLE TO GET CLEAN WAS AT TWO

00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:28.252
HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION. WE

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:29.587
ESTIMATE THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:30.821
AT LEAST ANOTHER TWENTY ONE

00:36:30.888 --> 00:36:32.557
MILLION. JUST FINISHED JUST

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:34.058
THOSE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.827
PROPERTY SO THAT'S THE AT THE

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:37.862
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED. NOW AS- AS

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:40.197
I MENTIONED THERE ARE FORTY SIX

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:40.798
HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.233
THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED. THEY

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.569
HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS LEFT.

00:36:44.635 --> 00:36:47.004
ON CONTAMINATION ON THEM SO. WE

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:48.372
ESTIMATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:50.474
TOXIC SUBSTANCES BASED ON YOU

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.343
KNOW PAST. HISTORY OF THE

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.344
ESTIMATES FOR CLEANING

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:55.313
PROPERTIES WILL NEED ANOTHER

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:56.113
THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.548
MILLION DOLLARS SO THE TOTAL

00:36:57.615 --> 00:37:00.117
COST. TO CLEAN UP ALL OF THE

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:03.287
CONTAMINATED SITES- DUE TO THE

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:06.490
EXACT. UP THE EGGS I'D LET LET

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.259
YOU KNOW CONTAMINATION AND

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.193
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VERNON

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.396
AREA- WILL BE A TOTAL OF SIX

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:12.930
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:16.667
DOLLARS- WHY WERE SOME OF THESE

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:20.905
THESE ESTIMATES ARE TOO LOW- WE

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:21.973
FEEL THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:23.074
TACTICS THERE WERE CERTAIN

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.742
ELEMENTS CERTAINLY THAT ARE OUT

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:26.677
OF THEIR CONTROL- BUT THERE ARE

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:27.612
OTHER THINGS THAT WERE

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:29.513
DEFINITELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.214
WHEN THEY WERE PUTTING THE

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:32.650
ESTIMATES TOGETHER. FOR EXAMPLE

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:33.918
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ANY

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:35.653
CONTRACT WHEN YOU'RE

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.487
CONTRACTING WITH SOMEONE TO DO

00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:37.989
THIS TYPE OF WORK. YOU HAVE TO

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:40.157
CONSIDER PREVAILING WAGE YOU

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:41.826
KNOW THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO

00:37:41.892 --> 00:37:42.960
TAKE MULTIPLE YEARS TO

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:44.695
COMPLETE. SO YOU SHOULD HAVE

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:46.297
INCLUDED A FACTOR FOR

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:48.432
INFLATION. AND THOSE ARE THE

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:49.400
TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE DID NOT

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.469
SEE- AND THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:53.070
BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:54.605
DEPARTMENT WAS COMING UP WITH

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.741
AN ESTIMATED COST OF ABOUT

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:57.274
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

00:37:57.341 --> 00:38:00.011
PROPERTY. RIGHT NOW WE ESTIMATE

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:03.214
IT'S ARE ON AVERAGE ABOUT SIXTY

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:03.748
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:05.116
PROPERTY SO THERE CERTAINLY ARE

00:38:05.182 --> 00:38:06.050
THINGS THAT WERE NOT IN THEIR

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:08.486
CONTROL WHETHER IT'S CETERA BUT

00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:09.654
THERE WERE THINGS LIKE

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.656
PREVAILING WAGE AND INFLATION

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:13.157
THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD HAVE

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:16.160
CONSIDERED WHEN IT CAME UP WITH

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:18.496
THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES. ON THE

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:21.499
OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAD. WITH

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:22.266
THE DEPARTMENT IS AS I

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:23.668
MENTIONED THERE WAS THAT ONE

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.136
CONTRACTOR. THAT THE

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:28.005
DEPARTMENT- ESSENTIALLY YOU

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:28.539
KNOW ORDERED THEM TO STOP

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:30.174
CONDUCTING WORK- AND THAT'S

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:31.942
BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT COST

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:33.711
OVERRUNS WILL THAT CONTRACT.

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.479
WAS FOR TIME AND MATERIALS

00:38:35.546 --> 00:38:37.114
RATHER THAN A FIXED PRICE

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.716
CONTRACT. IT WAS TIME AND

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.284
MATERIAL SO THAT CONTRACTOR

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:42.086
WENT OVER BUDGET BY ABOUT

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:43.454
SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS.

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.690
BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT BASICALLY

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:48.192
TOLD THEM TO STOP WORKING- SO

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.493
WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW OF

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.262
COURSE OF BEST PRACTICE IS A

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:53.230
FIXED PRICE CONTRACT. IF YOU

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:55.132
CAN'T DO THAT AT LEAST PERHAPS

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:56.600
A HYBRID CONTRACT WERE CERTAIN

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:57.835
COSTS ARE FIXED LIKE

00:38:57.902 --> 00:39:00.371
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. FOR

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:01.338
EXAMPLE WE MENTION THAT NO

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:02.973
REPORT. SO THERE ARE THINGS

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.542
THAT DEPARTMENT CAN DO AND

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.711
SHOULD DO ARE MOVING FORWARD SO

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:09.980
WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:11.348
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT.

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:12.883
IN THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:13.784
IDENTIFYING THE FULL AMOUNT OF

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:15.586
FUNDING. THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:17.354
NEEDS TO COMPLETE THE THIRTY

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:18.122
TWO HUNDRED HAS AYE SAID WE

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.623
ESTIMATE THEY NEED ANOTHER

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.392
TWENTY ONE MILLION. BUT ALSO

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:22.359
THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH AN

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:25.062
ESTIMATE FOR THOSE REMAINING

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:25.629
FORTY SIX HUNDRED PROPERTIES

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:26.964
BECAUSE AGAIN THOSE HAVE. A

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:28.766
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF LEAD

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:30.668
CONTAMINATION AS WELL. WE

00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:32.203
BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:34.271
SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR FUNDING.

00:39:34.338 --> 00:39:35.740
TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:38.075
SPRING BUDGET DISCUSSIONS- AND

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:39.510
IT NEEDS TO INCLUDE YOU KNOW WE

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:40.144
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.746
PANDEMIC HAS REALLY HIT OUR

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.848
ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY- SO THEY

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:45.015
NEED TO INCLUDE A RANGE OF

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:47.752
OPTIONS FOR. FUNDING FOR FULL

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.353
CLEAN P OR TRYING TO

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.689
PRIORITIZE THE PROPERTIES BASED

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:52.423
ON THE AMOUNT OF LEAD

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.825
CONTAMINATION. BASED ON THE

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:57.461
EXPOSURE- TO THAT THE RESIDENTS

00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.263
OF THAT COMMUNITY. ALSO THERE

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.598
THERE NEED TO BE OPTIONS

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:02.566
PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE ARE

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:05.002
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE INFORMED

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:07.071
DECISIONS ARE GOING FORWARD.

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:08.806
I'M ALSO WE NEED WE RECOMMEND

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:10.374
THAT THEY REVISED THEIR COST

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:12.209
ESTIMATION METHODS TO ENCOMPASS

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.912
THOSE FACTORS LIKE I. DISCUSSED

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:15.746
YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:16.714
INFLATION YOU'VE GOT TO

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.082
CONSIDER THE FACT THAT YOU YOU

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:19.483
HAVE TO PAY PREVAILING WAGES

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.585
ALL SORTS OF THINGS. AND THEN

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:23.854
AS I AS I RECENTLY INDICATED.

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.489
WHEN THEY WHEN THEY- PUT

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:26.791
TOGETHER CONTRACTS HOPEFULLY

00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:28.425
GET SOME ADDITIONAL CONTRACTORS

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:29.994
TO ASSIST WITH THE CLEANUP.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.028
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONTRACTS

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.163
ARE EITHER FIXED PRICE OR IF

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:34.598
NOT FIXED PRICE. OUR HYBRID

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:36.100
TYPE CONTRACT WHERE YOU HAVE

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.701
SOME COSTS THAT ARE FIXED LIKE

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:40.004
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS- AND THEN

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.772
PERHAPS OTHER COSTS ARE NOT FIX

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:43.440
THEIR MORE VARIABLE. BUT AT

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:44.642
LEAST IT'S A WAY FOR THE STATE

00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.076
OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTROL THE

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:47.344
COSTS A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:49.814
EFFICIENTLY. OUR THAN WE HAVE

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.783
DONE THUS FAR. SO THOSE. ARE

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.552
HIGH LEVEL FINDINGS KEY

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.654
RECOMMENDATIONS I WILL OPEN IT

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.255
UP TO QUESTIONS BOB HARRIS IS

EFFORT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:39.389
THE LEGISLATURE COULD EXPLORE

ENOUGH- WE RECOMMEND THAT. DGSE

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:57.107
PRESENT THE LEGISLATURE WITH A

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:59.276
DIFFERENT A RANGE OF OPTIONS

FOR WHAT FUTURE FUNDING COULD

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:01.478
LOOK LIKE ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:02.346
FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.848
PERSPECTIVE COULD BE A SHORTER

00:48:04.915 --> 00:48:06.683
TIME FRAME NOT NOT TO SAY THAT.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.453
LEGISLATORS RENEGING ON ITS

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:10.487
COMMITMENT TO CLEAN THESE

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:11.955
PROPERTIES BUT JUST TO HOLD

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:13.557
ACCOUNTABLE THE DEPARTMENT

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:15.025
THAT'S MANAGING THE CLEAN UP

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:17.527
EFFORT THERE THE- THE LENGTH OF

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:18.729
TIME THE FUNDING IS EXPECTED TO

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:19.730
LAST FOR WOULD BE A SHORTER

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:21.598
AMOUNT OF TIME PERHAPS ONLY. AN

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:23.367
ADDITIONAL FISCAL YEAR PASSED

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:23.900
WITH THEIR CURRENT

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.235
APPROPRIATION- CARRIED OUT THAT

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:27.971
WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO-

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:28.839
HAVE MORE FREQUENT

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:31.141
CONVERSATIONS WITH DGSE ABOUT

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:32.209
HOW THE CLEAN UP EFFORT IS

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:33.777
GOING. WHAT'S BEING DONE WITH

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:35.178
THAT FUNDING AND WHETHER

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.280
ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY

00:48:36.346 --> 00:48:38.115
AND WHY IF ANY NEW CONDITIONS

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:39.716
OF INTRODUCED THEMSELVES. THAT

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:41.752
MAKES THE COST ESTIMATES THAT

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:42.786
WERE ORIGINALLY PRESENTED NO

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:45.555
LONGER VIABLE SO- THAT IS ONE

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:48.992
POTENTIAL OVERSIGHT MECHANISM

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:49.526
THE LEGISLATURE HAS AT ITS

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:50.827

SEEK A REFUND FROM NOT JUST IN

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:03.293
ADDITION TO EXCITE. EXCITE HAS

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.595
ITS OWN UNIQUE. SITUATION GOING

00:51:05.662 --> 00:51:07.030
THROUGH A BANKRUPTCY COURT AT

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:08.899
THIS POINT IN TIME THAT MAY

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:10.801
LIMIT OUR ABILITY BUT CERTAINLY

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:11.968
WE HAVE EVERY LEGAL TOOL

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:14.838
POSSIBLE- TO CONTINUE. FIGHTING

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:17.107
EXCITED HOLDING THOSE

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:17.541
ACCOUNTABLE POLLUTER

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:18.575
COMMUNITIES. BUT BUT HAVING

00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:24.181
SAID THAT- YEAH WE'VE NOW SEEN

00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:27.184
PROBLEMS WITH THE T. S. C. R.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.619
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:31.354
THINK IT IN NON. BUT I THINK.

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.156
THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WOULD

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:34.624
THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING IS

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:36.359
WHAT. WHAT ADDITIONAL AUDITS

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:39.796
WOULD WE NOT ASK- I THINK THE

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:40.697
HEARING DOES CITY AND

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:41.898
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE BECAUSE

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.233
NOW WE KNOW IN WRITING FOR THE

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.068
STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. WHAT

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:47.437
WE'VE WHAT WE'VE- ALLEGED IN

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:49.506
THE PAST OF DTS YOU WORKING TOO

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:50.006
SLOW TO CLEAN UP THIS

00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:54.277
NEIGHBORHOOD- AND WE HAVE SOME

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:54.878
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE CAN WE

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:57.514
CAN IMPLEMENT. BUT BUT YOU KNOW

00:51:57.581 --> 00:52:00.650
THE QUESTION HAS TO ARISE-

00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:02.052
BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:03.153
THAT THAT WE'VE KNOWN THE TAX

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.421
YES HE HAS KIND OF DRAGGED ITS

00:52:04.488 --> 00:52:06.189
FEET ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:07.557
NUMBER ONE HAVING AN INTERN

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:10.594
PERMIT BAKER FOR OVER THIRTY

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.596
THREE THIRTY FIVE YEARS- BEFORE

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:15.265
BEFORE IT WAS SHUT DOWN- IS A

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:17.033
BIG PROBLEM. SO THE QUESTION

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.103
HAS TO RISER IN INCOMPETENCE IN

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.472
THE AGENCY- YOU HAVE TO ASK

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:23.673
THAT RATED THAT THAT YOU MAY

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.708
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THIS MAY

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:27.143
BE A QUESTION THAT THE AUDITOR

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:32.148
MAIL PINE ON- IS HERE WITH

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.850
THEIR NEGLIGENCE- OR IS A

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:36.219
CULTURAL- BECAUSE IF I'VE BEEN

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.555
IN THE LEGISLATURE- ALL RIGHT

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:39.022
WHEN I WAS GETTING THE

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:40.857
LEGISLATURE WE'VE GONE OUT TO

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:43.527
THREE. EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS. I

00:52:43.593 --> 00:52:45.095
DO BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN MAKE A

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:46.730
LIST OF THOSE BEFORE I CAME TO

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.031
THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'VE SEEN

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:49.966
THE SAME PROBLEMS TO PERSIST.

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:52.202
OVER AND OVER. FOR SOME POINT

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.170
TIME WE'VE GOT TO ASK IS IT. IS

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:59.175
IT COMPETENCE- IS A CULTURAL.

00:52:59.242 --> 00:52:59.776
OR NEGLIGENCE CAN WE POINT THE

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:02.746
FINGER TO. THE TIME TO TAKE A

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:04.681
LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE OF IT. I

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:07.117
DON'T WANT TO BE HERE SIX

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.852
MONTHS FROM NOW A YEAR FROM NOW

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:10.787
I CONTINUE IN THAT THE ASSETS

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.556
IN QUESTION NOT GRANTED I KNOW

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:13.123
THAT WE HAVE A NEW EXECUTIVE

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:15.091
DIRECTOR. ALSO IT'S NOT FAIR TO

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:18.028
LAY- ALL THOSE QUESTIONS-

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:21.197
BEFORE THAT PERSON BUT WE MIGHT.

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:23.199
BUT DO YOU HAVE A HINT- WHAT

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:24.601
THAT WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD POINT

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.770
THAT IF YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK IF

00:53:26.836 --> 00:53:31.775
YOU ARE ANSWERING THE QUESTION.

00:53:31.841 --> 00:53:35.211
SO CERTAINLY WE WERE REGIONAL.

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:39.249
COMPETENCY OR OR- INTEGRITY OF

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:40.283
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MANAGING THE

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.418
PROJECT AND WHATEVER THEY WERE

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:43.486
DOING SO IN GOOD FAITH- OR WITH

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:46.256
THE RIGHT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE-

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:48.491
WE'RE POINTING TO CRITICAL

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:50.994
DEFICIENCIES IN THE PLANNING OF

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:51.795
THE PROJECT AND THEN THE

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.396
MONITORING OF THE PROJECT THE

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:54.230
PLANNING WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:57.267
COST ESTIMATES AND EXPECT. HOW

00:53:57.334 --> 00:54:00.570
FAST THE CLEANUP WOULD PROGRESS

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:01.371
AND THEN THE MONITORING TO

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:02.906
ENSURE THAT THINGS WERE

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:05.442
ACTUALLY GOING AT THAT COST AND

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:06.910
GOING AT THAT SPEED OF CLEAN UP

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:08.478
SO THOSE THOSE PROJECT

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:11.481
MANAGEMENT- AREAS IF THE

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:12.415
DEPARTMENT PAYS ATTENTION TO

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:15.352
THOSE NOW- STAYS ON TOP OF

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:16.419
DEVELOPING A SOUND COST

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:18.054
ESTIMATE MAKING SURE THAT IT

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:19.556
HAS SUFFICIENT CONTRACTED STAFF

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:21.157
IN THE FIELD TO CONDUCT CLEAN

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:22.759
UP ACTIVITIES AT THE RIGHT PACE

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:25.195
AT THE EXPECTED PACE. THEN THIS

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:28.264
PROJECT WILL PROGRESS- OR IN

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:29.866
LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS IN THE

00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:31.334
FUTURE THAN IT HAS UP TO THIS

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:33.269
POINT MISTER CHAIRMAN PHILIP.

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:35.805
PLACEMENT SANTIAGO FOR. AND I

00:54:35.872 --> 00:54:37.073
WAS IN MEANING TOWARDS A PERSON

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.642
COULD BE UNFAIR FOR ME TO ASK

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:40.210
IF THERE WAS A PERSON WHO YOU

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:41.845
THOUGHT ANY OF THOSE THREE.

00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:44.247
ATTRIBUTES AND CAROLINE WITH I

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:45.448
WAS MORE MENTIONING AS AN

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:49.152
AGENCY- BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:51.888
ME TO UNDERSTAND- BUT I LOOK AT

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:52.822
REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY I'M NOT

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.357
THE ONLY ONE I DON'T KNOW- MY

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.026
COLLEAGUE ALSO REPRESENT TO

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:58.061
NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES ALSO

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:00.130
IMPACTED- BUT WE'VE GOT TO ASK

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:01.231
THE QUESTION BECAUSE WE WANT

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.333
OUR- BECAUSE- WE HAVE. WE SET

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.201
SOME MONEY ASIDE. WE WANT TO

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.870
CLEAN UP. AND IT'S NOT AN

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:09.806
ACADEMIC EXERCISE HERE YOU'LL

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:12.008
PEOPLE'S HEALTH ARE AT RISK.

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:15.979
PEOPLE COULD DIE. IT IS

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:21.885
ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS AND. WE

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.226
CENTRE PARKS AND SCHOOL SITES

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.560
WHERE WE KNOW CHILDREN ARE

01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:45.528
GONNA BE EXPOSED EVEN MORE

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.996
SIGNIFICANTLY IT SEEMS LIKE A

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.564
HUGE OVERSIGHT AND SOMETHING

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.398
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.267
AND- ASKING REALLY. GOOD

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.435
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THAT COULD

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:53.636
HAPPEN AND HOW WE STOP THAT

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:55.605
FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE AS

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:56.506
WE MUST BE PROTECTING THOSE

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.374
CHILDREN FOR THIS

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:03.112
CONTAMINATION. EVERYTHING. IS

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.414
GOING TO. HE WANTS THE- YOU

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.783
KNOW THE AMERICAN. STRONG I

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.453
THINK EUROPEAN. SO SIR THAT ONE

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.554
OF THE THAT WE DID ONCE WE HAD

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.055
THAT THESE PROPERTIES HAD BEEN

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.157
CLEANED YET THIS FIGURE OUT TRY

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.424
TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT TOOK FROM

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:16.692
THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE I

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:17.627
THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:20.429
FACTORS THAT AFFECTED THIS ONE

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:22.231
IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF SOME

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.666
OF THESE PROPERTIES AS

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:26.836
PUBLICLY. OWNED NOW THAT THAT

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:28.604
IS TRUE FOR SOME OF THEM BUT

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.839
NOT TRUE FOR ALL OF THE

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.741
PROPERTIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT-

01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:33.075
INITIALLY BELIEVED SO BAD

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.577
INITIALLY OVER IDENTIFIED THE

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:35.578
NUMBER THAT WERE PUBLICLY

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.079
OWNED. THE REASON THAT IT'S

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:39.081
IMPORTANT TO MAKE THAT

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:39.715
DISTINCTION BETWEEN PUBLICLY ON

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.417
A PRIVATELY OWNED IS. IF IT'S A

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:42.752
PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTY IT

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.187
COULD CONSTITUTE A PUBLIC WORK

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.788
UNDER STATE LAW. WHICH MEANS

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:46.622
THAT THE DEPARTMENTS

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:47.657
CONTRACTORS WOULD NEED TO BE

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.926
BONDED AT A CERTAIN LEVEL AND

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:51.594
IN A CERTAIN WAY. IN THE

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.628
DEPARTMENT HAS EXPRESSED TO US

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:54.330
THAT IT HAD DIFFICULTY. FINDING

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.998
CONTRACTORS WHO WERE ABLE TO

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:58.367
SATISFY THOSE REQUIREMENTS-

01:03:58.434 --> 01:03:59.969
WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.404
DELAY THEIR PROGRESS ON

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.472
CLEANING THOSE PROPERTIES. THAT

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:05.074
BEING SAID AS I MENTIONED A

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:05.841
MOMENT AGO THEY HAD

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:08.110
MISIDENTIFIED AS SOME OF THESE

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:09.712
PROPERTIES AS PUBLICLY ON WHEN

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:10.746
IN FACT THEY WERE PRIVATELY

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:14.550
OWNED- AND- THEY IDENTIFIED.

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:15.251
TWENTY FOUR OF THE CHILD CARE

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.552
CENTERS WERE ACTUALLY PRIVATE

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:18.120
RESIDENTIAL CHILDCARE CENTERS

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.355
WHEN THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:20.623
BELIEVED THEY WERE PUBLICLY

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:21.657
OWNED AND I'VE SENT TO SIGN

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:22.758
THOSE TO. ONE OF THEIR

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:25.695
CONTRACTORS TO CLEAN. BUT IT SO

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:26.963
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.431
SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND WHY

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:29.632
THERE WAS A DELAY IN CLEANING

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.835
THESE PROPERTIES CERTAINLY THEY

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:34.537
SHOULD HAVE BEEN. HIGH PRIORITY-

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:35.438
TO CLEAN WHICH IS WHY WE POINT

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:36.372
OUT THAT THERE WERE OTHER

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.506
PROCESSES THE DEPARTMENT COULD

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:39.408
YOU SUCH AS THE TECH WRECK TO

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:40.009
EXPEDITE THE CLEAN UP OF THOSE

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:43.946
PROPERTIES. ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:45.748
SO ARE THEY DO WE KNOW IF THE

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:46.215
DEPARTMENT AYE WE CAST

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:47.617
APARTMENT THIS I GUESS IS IN

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.118
THE PROCESS OF USING TO GRANT

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:51.320
TO GET THOSE FACILITIES CLEANED

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.689
UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:54.724
EXPRESSED TO. US ABOUT IT THAT

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:55.791
THEY ARE NOW MOVING FORWARD

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.393
WITH THAT AND I'LL LET THEM

THIS HEARING TOGETHER I JUST

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:41.437
GOT ELECTED TO THE AREA WHERE

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:44.407
THE IMPACT IS BEING FELT ON THE

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:47.243
RESIDENTIAL AREA SO I WONDER

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.245
YEAH I THINK THE EFFORT THAT

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.647
HAVE BEEN PUT IN BY ASSEMBLY

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:54.150
MEMBERS GARCIA AND SANTIAGO AND

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:57.586

PUSHING AND PUSHING AND

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:01.724
PUSHING. WHAT I AM AMAZED THAT

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.160
IS THAT THESE ISSUES WHAT THIS

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:07.396
DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN GOING ON

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.698
FOR DECADES. AND I KNOW TODAY

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.300
WERE TRYING TO DO A SLICE OUT A

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.869
PIECE OF HOW THEY HANDLED THE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:17.039
EXIDE. CLEANUP IN ALL THE

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:19.008
ISSUES THERE BUT THIS IS A

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:22.111
DEPARTMENT THAT. THAT THIS IS

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:24.513
THEIR EXPERTISE. THIS IS WHAT

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.182
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLING

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.918
FOR DECADES AND NOW- WE'RE

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:31.120
FINDING THROUGH YOUR AUDIT THAT

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:33.589
THINGS AS SIMPLE AS HAVING ONLY

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.124
ONE CONTRACTOR INSTEAD OF

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.460
HIRING SEVERAL. THAT THAT THEN

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:39.795
IMPACTS THE TIMING OF IT JUST

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:42.665
SEEMS OUTRAGEOUS YEAH IT'S MIND

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:46.001
BOGGLING UP BECAUSE THEY'RE A

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:47.169
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:49.638
THESE IN THIS COMMUNITY OF

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.307
COLOR. THAT HAVE BEEN

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:53.843
DEVASTATED WITH HEALTH ISSUES

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:55.878
WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND IT

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:58.781
SEEMS TO ME THIS AUDIT OUGHT

01:06:58.848 --> 01:06:59.949
TO. AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.951
IDENTIFY AND I REALLY

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.386
APPRECIATE VERY SPECIFIC

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.588
RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT TO DO

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.790
AND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.558
TO PUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:14.363
HOW MASSIVE. THE MPACT AND THE

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.098
DAMAGE AND THE SUFFERING ON

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:18.501
THESE COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.870
INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.571
CLEANUP OR LACK OF CLEAN UP

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:25.107
WORK SLOW CLEANUP OF EXCITED

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.743
SO. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.012
THAT AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.080
GET THE SPECIFIC

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:33.482
RECOMMENDATIONS WE ALSO GIVE

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:36.919
THE PUBLIC AN UNDERSTANDING. OF

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:39.422
THE DEVASTATION THAT THIS IS

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:41.690
CAUSING CONTINUES TO CAUSE AS

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:44.493
PART OF THE AUDIT BECAUSE

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.895
OTHERWISE IT APPEARS TO BE.

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:46.862
THESE WERE STEPS THAT SHOULD

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:49.198
HAVE BEEN TAKEN. THERE HAVEN'T

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.499
BEEN TAKEN AND NOW WE HAVE A

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:52.535
PROMISE TO TAKE THEM. AND

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:54.336
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH I DON'T

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.271
MEAN THAT'S NOT A GOOD ENOUGH

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.239
FOR THE AUDIT BUT IT'S NOT GOOD

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:58.641
ENOUGH. FOR THE STATE OF

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.342
CALIFORNIA TO HEAR IT IN THOSE

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:03.045
TERMS. AND I AGREE WITH

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:04.547
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO THAT

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:07.850
WE HAVE TO HAVE A MUCH DEEPER

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.752
UNDERSTANDING OF EVERYTHING

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:10.252
THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:12.922
DEPARTMENT. THAT HAS LED TO

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:16.592
THIS DAMAGE IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:18.961
AND I THINK THAT WE- WE DO A

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:22.364
DISSERVICE WHEN WE LEAVE THAT

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.232
OUT OF THE STORY AND THE

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:25.868
NEGATIVE. AND THE NARRATIVE AND

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.804
THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO- YOU

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.840
KNOW I'VE THAT MAY SOUND A

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:32.308
LITTLE BIT DRAMATIC TO SOME

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:36.912
PEOPLE BUT- I DON'T THINK

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:37.947
PEOPLE GET WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:39.849

ALLOW THIS COMPANY TO WALK AWAY

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:50.793
WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS IS

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.027
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.563
BACK AS CALIFORNIANS I WANT TO

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.499

THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED WITH

01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:13.482
CANCER- BECAUSE OF THE

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:15.351
POLLUTION AT THE SITE AND THE

THESE PROPERTIES IN OUR QUEUE.

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:23.826
OUR CLEAN UP OF THE THIRTY TWO

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:24.827
HUNDRED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.628

COURSE THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:35.671
COMMITTED TO CLEANING UP THESE

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:37.105
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS THAT

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:39.174
POSE THE GREATEST RISK. OF

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:41.810
EXPOSURE AS QUICKLY AND AS COST

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:43.812
EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN. WE ARE

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:45.480
WORKING TO CLEAN UP THESE

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:46.582
PROPERTIES WITH THE SCHEDULE AS

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:50.118
AGGRESSIVE AS COVERT ALLOWS. WE

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:51.453
RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY OF THIS

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.021
PROJECT WE'RE ON PACE TO

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:55.891
COMPLETE MORE THAN 90% OF THE

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:56.925
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED CLEAN UPS

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:57.626
AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:58.961
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WE HAVE

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:02.898
MADE. OVER DE TNCS FIRST SIX

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:04.533
YEARS WE ARE VERGE TWENTY ONE

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.069
PROPERTIES PER MONTH. AND I

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:11.173
WILL COMPARE THAT TO THE CLEAN

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.342
UP THAT THE ORDER REFERENCED

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:14.376
THAT MISTER HARRIS REFERENCE

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:15.878
THAT CLEAN UP WAS IN OMAHA

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.380
NEBRASKA IT TOOK I BELIEVE IT

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.482
TOOK SEVENTEEN YEARS. IN THE

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:21.817
FIRST SIX YEARS OF THAT CLEANUP

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.418
THEY AVERAGED ABOUT NINE

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:26.855
PROPERTIES MONTHS WE'RE MUCH

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:27.489
CLOSER TO TWENTY ONE PROPERTIES

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:30.826
A MONTH. SO AND EVEN BY THE END

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:32.561
OF LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:34.396
CLEAN UP NINETY PROPERTIES A

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:36.598
MONTH WEATHER PERMITTING AND

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:37.766
EVEN IN COOKING UNDER COVERT

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.935
CONDITIONS WE'RE GETTING CLOSE

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:42.137
TO SEVENTY PROPERTIES A MONTH.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:47.042
WHEN THINGS LINE UP. THERE ARE

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.744
SEVERAL BARRIERS THAT MAY STAND

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:50.712
IN THE WAY OF US ATTAINING OUR

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:52.814
GOAL. BUT SCHEDULING PROPERTIES

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.683
IS ONE OF THE GREATEST LIMITING

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:57.519
FACTORS. COBIT HAS MADE

01:15:57.586 --> 01:16:00.722
RESIDENTS VERY RELUCTANT TO

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:03.392
PARTICIPATE IN. IT IS A PAIN IN

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.661
THE CLEAN UP PROCESS. SO WE'VE

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:07.729
INCREASED OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:09.264
TO ENSURE THAT WE DO HAVE A

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:10.532
HIGH ENOUGH FOR A NUMBER OF

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.467
PROPERTIES IN THE QUEUE AT ALL

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:15.437
TIMES. TO CONTINUE THE UP THE

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:18.807
GAME THOSE EFFICIENCIES AND

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:19.408
MAKE SURE THAT THE CLEAN UP IS

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:20.909
CONTINUOUS. THE CURRENT

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:22.577
APPROPRIATION WILL NOT AS THE

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.112
AUDITOR POINTED OUT BEACH

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:26.515
SUFFICIENT TO CLEAN THE FULL

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:27.382
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS AND

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.817
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:31.720
THE LEGISLATURE. TO SECURE THE

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:32.220
FUNDING NEEDED FOR THIS

01:16:32.287 --> 01:16:34.656
CRITICAL WORK. THE EXACT NUMBER

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.458
OF PARCELS THEY CAN BE CLEANED

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:37.292
UP WITH OUR CURRENT

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.728
APPROPRIATION WILL DEPEND ON A

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:41.630
NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING.

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.298
SIZE AND CONFIGURATION OF THE

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:46.101
PROPERTY COVERT NINETEEN AND

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:50.772
OTHER LIMITATIONS THAT- WE ARE

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.274
HARD TO PREDICT IN IN ADVANCE.

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:54.643
WE ARE SEEING ARE ALSO SEEING

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.445
INCREASED IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:58.947
CHANGE WE HAVE EXCESSIVE HEAT

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:01.049
DAYS TO CONSIDER. WE'RE NOW

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:03.251
EXPERIENCING DAYS WHERE WE HAVE

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:04.653
TO SEND OUR CREWS HOME BECAUSE

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.721
THEY'RE GETTING EXPOSED TO

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.055
WILDFIRE SMOKE AND THAT'S

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.757
SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT PART OF

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.692
THE PROCESS REALLY ON. AND OF

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.761
COURSE RAIN TO GET REMAINS

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:16.064
UNPREDICTABLE. THE TOPICS OF

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.866
RECOMMENDATIONS THREE AND FOUR

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:19.334
ARE PLANNING AND FUNDING OF

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:22.471
ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES BEYOND

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.038
THOSE FOR WHICH WE CURRENTLY

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:25.374
HAVE FUNDS. IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.075
OUR INTENT TO HOLD EXCITED

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:28.810
COUNTABLE FOR THIS CLEAN UP BUT

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:30.312
WITH THEIR MOST RECENT

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.948
BANKRUPTCY WE ARE REGROUPING.

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:35.150
WE ALWAYS HAVE WE ALWAYS HAVE

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.651
BEEN AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO

ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.424
SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO GOVERNOR

DOLLAR COMMITMENT. UPON TAKING

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:51.666
OFFICE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:53.902
TIME OF GREAT A GREAT DEAL OF

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:56.938
UNCERTAINTY. IF THE PAN GIVEN

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:59.508
THE PANDEMIC SO WE CAN'T BE

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:01.343
SURE WHERE THE STATE'S

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:04.413
FINANCIAL SITUATION WILL BE. AS

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:04.980
WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT FISCAL

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:08.150
YEAR. AND OF COURSE A NEW

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.685
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ADDS

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:14.723
ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY. SO WE

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:15.791
DON'T KNOW HOW THE NEW

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:18.460
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES WILL

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.128
IMPACT OUR ROADS OUR STATE SO

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:22.197
CALIFORNIA'S FISCAL STATUS IS

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:23.732
QUITE UNCERTAIN AND AS A RESULT

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.434
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO COMMIT TO

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.071
SPECIFICS OF A PROPOSAL RIGHT

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:34.209
NOW. FOR NEXT SPRING. YOUR LAST

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:36.011
RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:37.512
INCORPORATE FIXED PRICE

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:39.548
ELEMENTS IN ANY FUTURE CLEAN UP

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:41.583
CONTRACTS. AS I NOTED THE

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.418
DEPARTMENT ANIL CONTRACTORS

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:44.419
HAVE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.955
COURSE OF THIS PROJECT

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:48.557
UNPRECEDENTED CLEANUP. THE

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:50.092
NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS IS THAT

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.060
THERE ARE IS A LOT OF RISK AND

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.496
UNCERTAINTY AND BECAUSE OF THIS

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.131
IT WAS EVEN CHALLENGING TO GET

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:58.300
MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS TO BID ON

01:18:58.366 --> 01:19:01.736
THIS PROJECT. BUT EACH PROPERTY

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:04.239
IS UNIQUE WITH SIZE AND

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:06.441
CONFIGURATION AND- SOMETIMES WE

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:09.077
DON'T EVEN KNOW ME- THE

01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:10.679
SPECIFICS UNTIL WE BEGIN

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:12.314
WORKING FOR INSTANCE ON

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.015
COVERAGE OF BURIED UTILITY

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:16.184
LINES. WE ARE LEARNING FROM

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.719
THESE AND WE ARE BETTER ABLE TO

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.955
ANTICIPATE THOSE IN SCHEDULING.

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:22.190
AND I THINK WE CONSTANTLY

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:24.159
REVISIT OUR ENGINEERS ESTIMATES

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.827
IN OUR SCHEDULING ESTIMATES AND

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:28.663
ARE MUCH MORE REALISTIC ABOUT

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.565
WHAT WE CAN ATTAIN IT THIS TIME.

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:31.967
AND AS I MENTIONED OTHER

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:34.636
FACTORS COME IN PEOPLE HAVE TO

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.438
CHANGE THEIR SCHEDULES. WE HAVE

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:37.639
OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.908
CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO THINGS DO

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:42.110
REMAIN UNPREDICTABLE. IN THE

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.179
MEANTIME WE HAVE INCORPORATED A

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.280
NUMBER OF GUARD RAILS TO

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:46.982
CONTROL COSTS IN OUR CURRENT

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:50.285
CONTRACTOR IS OPERATING UNDER A

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:52.521
CONTRACT THAT DOES HAVE THIS

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:55.357
FIXED PRICE ELEMENTS. BEFORE I

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:56.825
CONCLUDE I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:59.394
EXCITING IN THE LARGER CONTEXT

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:02.564
OF DGSE. AS I SAID WE'VE

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.566
LEARNED A GREAT DEAL NOT ONLY

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.934
FROM THIS CLEAN UP BUT ALSO

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:09.204
FROM EXCITED BANKRUPTCY. WE'VE

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.039
BEEN APPLYING WHAT WE LEARNED

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:13.475
TO HOW WE'VE RIGHT INSPECT AND

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.377
ENFORCE OUR PERMITS. IT'S

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:17.712
IMPORTANT TO HAVE UP TO DATE

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:19.481
PERMITS IN PLACE THAT MAKE IT

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.216
CLEAR TO AN OPERATOR WHAT THEIR

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:23.919
OBLIGATIONS ARE AND THAT MEANS

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.887
EXPECT THEM TO MEET THOSE

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:28.523
OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILL HOLD

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.458
THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE. WE

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:31.793
ALSO NOTE THAT EXCITES

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.094
FINANCIAL ASSURANCE WAS

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:36.731
INADEQUATE. IN RESPONSE TO SB

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:37.666
SIX SEVENTY THREE WE'VE ALREADY

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:40.502
PUT TOGETHER STRICTER.

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:43.505
FINANCIAL ASSURANCE TESTS AND

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:45.774
REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE. AND

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.209
WE'RE REVIEWING FINANCIAL

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:49.311
ASSURANCE MECHANISMS. MORE

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:51.279
FREQUENTLY FOR PERMITTED

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:53.515
FACILITIES BUT THERE ARE

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:54.816
OPPORTUNITIES TO GO EVEN

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:56.284
FURTHER IN STRENGTHENING

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:59.354
FINANCIAL ASSURANCE WE BEGAN TO

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:01.756
PURSUE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. AND

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:03.525
LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING SOME OF

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:04.759
THE OUTCOMES OF THAT WITH THE

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:08.029
LEGISLATURE. OUR EXPERIENCE

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:09.364
WITH THAT SIDE HAS MADE US A

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:12.667
BETTER ORGANIZATION. EXIDE

01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:15.704
BANKRUPTCY SYMBOLIZES A MUCH

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.672
LARGER PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:19.140
IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:22.043
ARE WITH BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.378
FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.946
THOUSAND CONTAMINATED SITES

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:27.749
ACROSS THE STATE MANY WITHOUT

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:30.485
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. IT IS TIME

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.720
FOR THE STATE TO COME TO TERMS

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.255
WITH THAT AND TO BE REALISTIC

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.123
ABOUT THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.025
ADDRESS THE LUCK TOXIC LEGACY

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.994

ASK IS THE DEPARTMENT LOOKING

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:38.633
AT SECURING ADDITIONAL

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.735
CONTRACTORS AND I KNOW THE

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:42.337
AUDITOR ALSO MENTIONED- HAVING

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:44.138
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR THOSE

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:45.773
CONTRACTORS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:46.407
WE'RE MEETING OUR DEADLINES AND

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:48.409
TIMELINES. TO CLEAN UP THESE

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:48.877
PROPERTIES WHAT'S THE

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:51.546
DEPARTMENT DOING TO HELP- CLEAN

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:54.282
UP THESE PROPERTIES- QUICKER IF

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:58.186
YOU IF YOU MAY. SO I THINK THE

01:25:58.253 --> 01:25:59.754
CONTRACT WE HAVE IN PLACE ANY

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:03.258
C. HAS- THEY THERE ARE SMALL.

01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:04.926
BUT THEY REALLY AND THEN CELLS

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.594
IN TERMS THEIR ABILITY TO GET

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:07.996
THE PROPERTIES CLEANED. IN A

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:10.732
TIMELY FASHION AND STAY WITHIN

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:12.534
OUR COST REQUIREMENTS. AND SO

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:13.801
WE'RE VERY SATISFIED WITH THEM

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:17.005
WE ARE LIKELY TO SUBCONTRACT.

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:19.574
AND HAVE THEM USES OVERSEE A

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:21.943
SUBCONTRACTOR TO ADD

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.012
ADDITIONAL. OUR CREWS OUT IN

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:25.446
THE FIELD AND INCREASE OUR

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.715
CAPACITY. FOR CLEAN UP AND

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:31.085
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST COURSE

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:31.853
OF ACTION. ENTERING INTO NEW

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.589
CAR IS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:36.724
AND TIME CONSUMING AND GIVEN

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.626
THE MOMENTUM WE HAVE WITH THE

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:40.995
CURRENT CONTRACTOR. WE FEEL THE

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:43.064
BEST INVESTMENT IS TO CONTINUE

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.933
TO WORK WITH THAT CONTRACTOR. I

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:46.834
DO WANT TO SAY ONE THING WHICH

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:50.705
IS THAT IN THIS. IT I HAVE BEEN

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:52.173
CITY'S NEIGHBORHOODS AND IT

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.142
SEEMS IT TAKES TO GET THE CLEAN

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:55.843
UPS DONE SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:57.812
RESORT FOR INSTANCE TO HAND

01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:00.148
EXCAVATION WE CAN'T USE LARGE

01:27:00.214 --> 01:27:02.650
MACHINERY TO DO THE JOB. AND

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:04.619
IT'S THE LOGISTICS ARE VERY

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.254
COMPLEX AND SO WE EVEN HAVE

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:07.722
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WE CAN'T

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:09.557
ADD ADDITIONAL CREWS BECAUSE

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:12.193
THE IMPACTS TO PARKING IN THE

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.428
NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE. I JUST

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:15.797
COMPLETELY UNMANAGEABLE SO

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:17.365
THERE WILL BE A LIMIT ON HOW

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:19.367
MUCH CLEAN UP WE CAN GET DONE.

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:21.336
JUST BASED ON THE LOGISTICAL

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:23.938
CONSIDERATIONS. CATTERTON JUST

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:26.107
LOGISTICALLY WE BECAUSE OF THE

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:28.209
MAP I SAW LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN'T

01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:29.711
YOU'RE MITIGATING IN A LOT OF

01:27:29.777 --> 01:27:31.713
DIFFERENT AREAS ALL ON ALL

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:33.281
SIDES OF EXCITED TO PLAY- THE

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:35.183
ORIGINAL PROPERTY. I MEAN WHY

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:36.351
WOULD IN A CONTRACT TO BE ABLE

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:37.785
TO WORK ON SAY THE EAST SIDE

01:27:37.852 --> 01:27:39.220
AND THE WEST SIDE YET TO

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:41.522
CONTRACTORS ARE THREE IN THE

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:44.092
NORTH AND SOUTH. AND WE DIDN'T

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:45.493
TAKE LONG APPROACH WHEN WE

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.729
STARTED THE PROJECT. ARE YOU

01:27:47.795 --> 01:27:49.597
JUST A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:51.532
THIS WHICH IS TO SAY THAT. WE

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:54.402
STILL. DO FOR USE THAN THINK

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:55.503
ABOUT THE GEOGRAPHIC THE

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:58.206
GEOGRAPHY A LOT- AND AGAIN IF

01:27:58.272 --> 01:27:59.907
WE HAD A SECOND CONTRACTOR WE

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:00.642
WOULD THINK ABOUT THOSE.

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.810
SITUATIONS RIGHT NOW OUR INTENT

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:03.978
IS NOT TO HAVE MOVED TO A

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:07.615
SECOND CONTRACT. AND OF THE

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:09.250
POTENTIAL TO. AND DIFFICULT

01:28:09.317 --> 01:28:11.019
GETTING ANOTHER SET CONTRACTOR

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:14.756

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:21.629
SIMPLY THE SAKE OF MANAGING THE

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:25.233
LOGISTICAL. COMPLICATIONS

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:26.968
UNDERSTOOD YEAH I WOULD THINK

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:05.346
PROPERTIES THAT WERE MISSED- IT

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:06.814
WASN'T LIKE WE MISSED YOU KNOW

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:08.282

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:09.583
PAPER WE- WE DID A PERMIT

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:12.920
WRONG. IT WAS THIRTY ONE

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.121
PROPERTIES. SOMEBODY SHOULD

01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:15.923
HAVE BEEN. SCREAMING AT THE TOP

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:18.292
OF THEIR LUNGS- TO A DIRECTOR

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:20.328
AT THE TSC. WHO SHOULD BE

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:21.529
COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:22.897
ASKING HEY I'VE GOT A PROBLEM

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:25.066
HERE THIRTY ONE. PROPERTIES OF

01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:26.267
THESE OF THE LAWS THAT PREVENT

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.436
ME FROM CLEANING IT UP. BECAUSE

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:28.936
THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN THE

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:30.271
LEGISLATURE WE CHANGE LAWS. YOU

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:31.105
KNOW IT IF WE NEEDED TO CLEAN

01:33:31.172 --> 01:33:33.808
IT UP WE CAN CHANGE THAT LAW-

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:34.942
BUT TO HAVE IT FOUND OUT THERE

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:38.946
WERE NOT IT IS. I WOULD. YOU

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:39.747
KNOW BY BORA PROFESSIONAL

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:40.748
SETTINGS I WON'T SAY WHAT I

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:42.316
WANT TO SAY BUT IT'S- IT'S

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:44.118
DISHEARTENING. TO FIND OUT THE

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:45.419
TOOK A NOT AT THE FIND OUT THAT

01:33:45.486 --> 01:33:47.321
THERE WAS THIRTY ONE-

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:48.456
PROPERTIES THAT WERE NOT

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:49.991
CLEANED. WE COULD CHANGE THOSE

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:54.662
LAWS- ASSEMBLY- EVEN NIGHT I

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:58.666
THINK WE I COULD HAVE A- AN

01:33:58.733 --> 01:34:00.167
URGENT CLAUSE TO OF THOSE TO

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:00.768
MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT PROPER

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:02.203
CLEANED OR AT LEAST WE WERE

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:03.938
HAVE TRIED. SOMEONE JUST PUT

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:05.473
THAT THERE AT THAT DAY YOU HAVE

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:09.377
YOUR ABILITY- TO COME TO THE-

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:11.312
SAY THIS IS WHAT'S PREVENTING-

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:12.213
THE ABILITY FOR ME TO GETTING

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:14.448
THIS STUFF DONE. LET'S LET'S

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:15.349
WORK TOGETHER ON CHANGING

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:16.317
WHATEVER IT IS WHATEVER

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.652
OBSTACLE THERE IS THAT IS AT

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:20.287
YOUR DISPOSAL AND WE WOULD WANT

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:20.888
TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:23.124
INTEREST TO DO THAT- THAT'S

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:27.795
BEEN SET NOW- YEAH BUT BUT WHEN

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:29.430
YOU TALK TO THE GENERAL GENERAL

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:30.097
PUBLIC OR AT LEAST MY

01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:32.366
CONSTITUENTS IF I WERE TO GO TO

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:33.768
THEM AND SAY HERE'S ALL THE

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.069
DIFFERENT REASONS WHY WE

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:36.303
COULDN'T CLEAN UP THE

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:38.639
PROPERTIES- THEY WOULDN'T

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:40.541
HESITATE BUT BUT TO TRY TO FIND

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:42.910
SOMEBODY NEW. AND I THINK

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:43.477
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:44.879
FACING IT IS TO TRY TO FIGURE

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:50.684
OUT. HOW WE NOT ONLY IMPLEMENT

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:51.719
ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT

01:34:51.786 --> 01:34:54.555
MAYBE OR COMPLETE OVERHAUL AND

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.290
REFORM OF THE T. T. S. C. SO

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:58.492
THAT ACTUALLY CAN FIX THE

01:34:58.559 --> 01:34:59.827
PROBLEM THAT'S BEFORE US WHICH

01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:01.595
IS CLEANING UP THE PROPERTIES

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:04.098
BECAUSE THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:07.234
PROPERTIES A LOT- EIGHT AND WE

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:07.835
ONLY HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:09.103
FUNDS. YOU KNOW I KNOW I'VE

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:11.005
I'VE I'VE SAID A COUPLE THINGS

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:13.107
THAT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY.

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:15.943
ABOUT BUT I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:19.180
REACTION ON ON MAYBE- WHAT

01:35:19.246 --> 01:35:22.516
TOOLS YOU NEED. HOW IS THIS

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:23.117
GOING TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:25.786
NOW THAT YOU. AND HOW WE GET

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:26.387
THESE CLEANED UP AS FAST AS

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:27.788
POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:29.323
SAID BEFORE IN IN IN IT SOUNDS

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:31.258
ALARMING BUT IT'S VERY TRUE.

01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:33.794
IT'S VERY TRUE PEOPLE'S LIVES

01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:38.032
ARE AT STAKE. PEOPLE MAYBE HAVE

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:41.435
DIED HAVE DIED IN COULD DIE WE

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:42.803
HAVE KIDS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:44.872
ASTHMA- WITHIN THE GENERAL

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:46.807

OF BIRTH DEFECTS AS YOU'VE

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:57.485
HEARD IN THE AREA. HIGH LEVELS

01:35:57.551 --> 01:35:59.220
OF CANCER THE DISTRIBUTED TO

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:01.489
DIFFERENT REPORTS- WE HAVE THE

01:36:01.555 --> 01:36:02.923
POTENTIAL OF WATER A POTENTIAL

01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:05.726
BEING CONTAMINATED. AND YET

01:36:05.793 --> 01:36:07.328
WE'RE NOT MOVING AT LIGHTNING

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:09.296
SPEED WITH WHAT A SENSE OF

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:11.765
URGENCY BREAKING DOWN EVERY

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:15.202
SINGLE PAYER BEFORE US- SO YOU

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:32.286
NEIGHBORHOOD. WHEN CAN I GET

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:33.354
YOUR REACTION ABOUT WHAT SCHOOL

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.155
YOU KNOW HOW WE'VE DONE THIS

01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:36.857
AUDIT. WHAT WE SEE THAT IS

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:39.160
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAT SETS

01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:41.195
IN THAT SENSE OF URGENCY. THAT

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:44.098
THIS COMMUNITY MERITS DEMANDS

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:48.636
AND DESERVES. THANK YOU

01:36:48.702 --> 01:36:51.038
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I HAVE TO SAY

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:52.940
FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:54.575
IMAGINE THE PAIN AND

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:57.578
FRUSTRATION WE HEAR IT DIRECTLY

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:58.913
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:01.182
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. AS YOU

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:02.983
KNOW THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.919
PROCESS THERE WERE A NUMBER OF

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.887
PUBLIC HEARINGS AND WE HEARD.

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:08.756
JUST HOW IMPACTFUL THIS HAS

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:11.425
BEEN THOSE STORIES WERE REALLY

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.427
TOUGH TO LISTEN TO AND IT'S

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:16.597
REALLY- AGAIN IT DOES GIVE US A

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:19.066
SENSE OF URGENCY. I ALSO

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.801
APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:22.503
WILLINGNESS TO DO WHATEVER IT

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.505
TAKES TO GET THIS CLEAN UP DONE

01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:28.442
AND TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE. AND

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:30.945
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE DGSE HAS

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:33.414
VERY GOOD AUTHORITIES WE HAVE

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.749
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES WE HAVE

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:37.885
THE AUTHORITY TO USE THE TECH

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:39.820
REPRISE SAYS AND THIS REALLY

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.789
COMES DOWN TO USING THOSE WITH

01:37:41.855 --> 01:37:43.624
AUTHORITIES USING THEM WISELY

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:45.259
AND USING THEM STRATEGICALLY

01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:47.928
AND MAKE SURE THINGS GET DONE

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:48.996
AND GET DONE QUICKLY. AND WE'VE

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:50.731
BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:37:50.798 --> 01:37:52.933
THAT AND ARE MOVING VERY

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.301
AGGRESSIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.604
THAT'S THE CASE. IF YOU WERE TO

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.372
GO ON OUR WEBSITE TODAY YOU

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.107
WOULD EASILY BE ABLE TO FIND

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:01.508
THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT HAVE

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:02.476
BEEN PROPERTIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.245
CLEANED UP AND WE TRACK OUR

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:05.946
PROGRESS ON THE WEBSITE. WE

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:08.549
WILL BE TRACKING THE SPECIFICS

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:10.351
AROUND THE DAY CARES AND

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:13.220
SCHOOLS ON THE WEBSITE ALSO

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:14.088
THAT'LL BE UP AND RUNNING

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:16.957
SHORTLY- AND THAT'S ONE WAY TO

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:19.360
WEAR IT IF YOU SEE US GOING OFF

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:21.028
TRACK. WITH WHAT I SAID TODAY

01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:22.363
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF

01:38:22.429 --> 01:38:24.131
PROPERTIES WE HAVE LINED UP TO

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:26.900
CLEAN BEFORE SPRING OF TWENTY

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:29.169
TWENTY ONE. I EXPECT TO BE BACK

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:31.872
BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEES I EXPECT

01:38:31.939 --> 01:38:34.341
YOU TO ASK US WHAT WENT WRONG.

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:36.410
BUT AS I SAID AND I TAKE DEEP

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:39.213
PERSONAL PRIDE IN THIS WE ARE A

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.482
LEARNING ORGANIZATION AND WE

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:44.685
HAVE WORKED. AND SO YES

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:48.555
MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE BUT WE

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:51.158
ARE NOT. UP TEN PROPERTIES A

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.459
MONTH WE'RE CLEANING UP SEVENTY

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:53.394
PROPERTIES A MONTH WE ARE

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.630
MOVING QUICKLY. AND WE DO HAVE

01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:58.666
THE ABILITY TO COURSE CORRECT.

01:38:58.732 --> 01:39:00.034
THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.169
ABOUT IS OF THESE THE LARGER IS

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:03.370
THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:05.472
TNC AND I'D SAY. WE ARE

01:39:05.539 --> 01:39:07.675
REGULATORS IT IS OUR JOB TO

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:09.743
REGULATE AND PART OF THAT MEANS

01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:12.513
THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:15.382
MAKING DECISIONS. AND ONE OF

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:16.583
THE BIGGEST BREAKDOWNS THAT

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:19.086
CAME WITH RESPECT TO EXCITE WAS

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:20.587
THE FACT THAT THAT INTERIM

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:23.057
STATUS. PERMANENT A DECISION

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:25.959
WASN'T MADE EITHER ON THAT ARE

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:29.663
NOT IN A ROOM STATUS OF.

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:31.532
SITUATION BUT IMPORTANTLY ON

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:36.170
THE AT THE APPLE. THAT THEY SO.

01:39:36.236 --> 01:39:38.205
TO BE A PER FOR. AND THAT

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:41.508
PERMIT WAS VERY LOW. AND YET

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:42.976
THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T MAKE THE

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:45.579
DECISION IN A TIMELY FASHION.

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:48.649
SO FIRST OF ALL WE DO NOT HAVE

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:50.150
ANY OTHER SITES ON MONITORING

01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:52.286
STATUS INTERM STATUS IS ONLY

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:53.287
FOR NEW SITES THAT COME ON

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:55.589
BOARD AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:57.458
APPLYING FOR A PERMIT AND

01:39:57.524 --> 01:39:59.226
WAITING FOR A PERMIT DECISION

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:01.695
SO. THERE ARE NO OFFICE WHERE

01:40:01.762 --> 01:40:03.163
WE DON'T HAVE A SOME KIND OF

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.099
PERMIT IN PLACE THAT WILL ALLOW

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:08.836
US TO ENFORCE TO TAKE ACTION-

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:10.104
FOR WE DO HAVE WHAT WE CALL

01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.672
CONTINUED PERMITS THOSE ARE

01:40:11.739 --> 01:40:13.307
PERMITS THAT EXPIRED BUT ARE.

01:40:13.374 --> 01:40:15.509
ARE STILL ENFORCEABLE AND THIS

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:16.910
IS WHERE I RETURNED TO THE

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:19.580
DECISION ISSUE. UNLESS THERE

01:40:19.646 --> 01:40:22.516
ARE UP TO DATE PERMITS IN PLACE

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:23.584
THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MODERN

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:26.820
BEST PRACTICES. FOR MANAGING

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:28.889
HAZARDOUS WASTE AND TAKE INTO

COULD ADMIT THAT SOMETHING WAS

01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:52.539
WRONG THEN YOU CAN ADMIT THE

FIXING IT. AND PART OF THE

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:55.476
PROBLEM WITH THE EASY THE

EXCUSE. SO IT IS A BIT

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:02.516
ENCOURAGING DOESN'T TAKE AWAY

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:04.918
THE PAIN DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE-

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:05.853
THE HURT AND THE ANGER THAT I

CONSTITUENTS FEEL. AND IT

01:42:10.123 --> 01:42:16.663
DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE FIERCE-

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:18.298
AND THE FIGHT THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:18.899

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.001
CLEANED UP. BUT AT LEAST

01:42:21.068 --> 01:42:22.703
ADMITTING. THAT THAT DECISION

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:24.204
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE. AND IT

01:42:24.271 --> 01:42:28.208
WASN'T. ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND

01:42:28.275 --> 01:42:29.643

THE SAMPLES OF ALL THE

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.416
RESIDENCES IN THE AREA ARE YOU

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:43.650
NOTICING ANY TRENDS OR

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:46.286
DISTRIBUTION OR THEIR PLUMES OR

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:48.322
LIKE A LIKE BUTTON NATURAL-

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:50.457
OCEAN BREEZES THAT GO A CERTAIN

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:51.224
DIRECTION MOST OF THE TIME ARE

01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:55.062
WE SAYING. WHAT WE SEEING FROM

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:56.363
THE EXITE. PLANT WHERE WHERE

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:57.965
WHERE MORE THE LEAD WEARS MORE

01:43:58.031 --> 01:44:02.936
THE LEAD LOCATED. SO WE HAVE

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:05.672
SAMPLED ALL OVER THE ONE POINT

01:44:05.739 --> 01:44:06.840
SEVEN MILE RADIUS THAT WE

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:08.575
CALLED THE PER KILOMETRE

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:11.078
INVESTIGATION AREA. AND BLOODY

01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:13.714
IS A VERY I MEAN IT'S A HEAVY

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:16.316
SUBSTANCE AND AS A RESULT IT'S

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:18.318
NOT LIKE A VERY FINE WHITE

01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:20.621
WHITE NOT VERY DENSE SUBSTANCE

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.122
BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE AIR

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:24.224
IT DISTRIBUTES ITSELF EVENLY

01:44:24.291 --> 01:44:25.759
AND BLOWS AROUND. AND PUTTING

01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:28.495
EVEN COATING WHEREVER IT LANDS

01:44:28.562 --> 01:44:31.098
LET IS VERY DIFFERENT IT IT IT

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:34.334
DEPOSITING VERY LOCALIZED WAVES

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:36.436
YES THERE ARE SOME CAN AND SOME

01:44:36.503 --> 01:44:37.638
RELATIONSHIPS TO PREVAILING

01:44:37.704 --> 01:44:41.742
WINDS. BUT IT IS REMARKABLE HOW

01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:44.378
YOU CAN FIND A HIGH LEAD LEVEL

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:46.713
IN ONE PROPERTY AND AN ADJACENT

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.382
PROPERTY YOU MAY NOT FIND THAT

01:44:48.448 --> 01:44:49.449
SAME LEAD LEVEL AND THAT'S A

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:51.318
POINT OF CONFUSION AND

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:53.086
FRUSTRATION OF FOLKS BUT THAT

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:55.022
IS THE NATURE OF LAND AND HOW

01:44:55.088 --> 01:44:56.823
IT DISTRIBUTES UP. THERE ARE

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:59.292
NO- IT'S NOT LIKE A GROUNDWATER

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:01.161
PLUME WHERE YOU FOLLOW THE CAN

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:02.696
MAN YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:03.096

CONTAMINATION. THANK YOU IN-

WE'VE BEEN ANSWERING KIND OF

THIS HOME STRETCH OF THE THIRTY

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:54.608
TWO HUNDRED. WE HAVE FELT THAT

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:56.109
IT'S MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:58.011
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.013
PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.248
CLEAN UP NO MATTER IF WE

UP TO SPEED AND GET THEM

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.991
ORIENTED. IT WOULD TAKE THEM AT

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:13.860
LEAST SIX EIGHT TEN MONTHS

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:16.029
BEFORE THEY EVEN APPROXIMATED

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:17.030
THE RATE OF CLEAN UP THAT WE

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.064
SEE WITH OUR CURRENT

01:47:18.131 --> 01:47:20.667
CONTRACTOR. AND IF THE PRIORITY

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:22.269
IS TO GET AS MANY PROPERTIES

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:23.737
CLEANED UP AS FAST AS AS WE

01:47:23.804 --> 01:47:26.439
CAN. WE FEEL THAT THE BEST

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:28.508
DECISION IS TO STICK WITH THE

01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:57.203
HELPFUL TO SPEAK TO. DURING

01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:58.605

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:04.477
SAID THE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:06.346
GOING TO NEED. I THINK HAVING

01:53:06.412 --> 01:53:08.515
THAT BEFORE US ALLOWS US AS THE

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:10.617
LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE. AND

01:53:10.683 --> 01:53:11.885
HAVE FRANK DISCUSSIONS THAT

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:13.720
WOULD GET THEM GO HOME AND HAVE

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:14.254
FRANK DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AS WELL AND

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:19.259

LEGISLATURE IN THE COMMUNITY

01:53:23.563 --> 01:53:24.330
SIX ALSO BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:25.398
WORKING ON IT WAY LONGER THAN

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:27.500
I. THAN I HAVE. HI AND I DO

01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:28.268

MORE MEMBERS WHO ARE AREPART

01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:32.038
OF THIS FIGHT NOW- AND THE

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:33.106
DEPARTMENT THAT I THINK IS

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:34.707
TRYING THAT UNDER YOUR

01:53:34.774 --> 01:53:36.609

THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANYMORE

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:42.515
EXCITES US. IN THE FUTURE- WE

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:44.150
WERE BORED AND SO. I DO HOPE

01:53:44.217 --> 01:53:46.052
YOU LOOK AT THE TNC REFORM

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:47.453

02:10:16.308 --> 02:10:18.343
DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE

02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:19.678

THE STATE WAS SO CONCERNED

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:39.698
ABOUT THE POSIBLE BANKRUPTCY

02:10:39.765 --> 02:10:42.434
WHAT'S THAT. C. LAW ALLOWS

RESPONSIBLE TO ABANDON

02:10:44.303 --> 02:10:46.138
PROPERTIES AND THEY CAN WALK

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:47.673
AWAY AND THE PROPERTY CAN BE

02:10:47.739 --> 02:10:50.742
COMPLETELY. UNPROTECTED IT CAN

02:10:50.809 --> 02:10:53.512
BE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE- TO KEEP

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:55.614
SAFE TO SELL IF BUT WHEN THE

02:10:55.681 --> 02:10:58.116

IS PHASE ONE OF CLOSURE THAT'S

02:13:14.219 --> 02:13:15.687
WHERE YOU TAKE THE BUILDINGS

02:13:15.754 --> 02:13:17.789
THAT ARE REGULATED UNDER

02:13:17.856 --> 02:13:19.725

GROUND LEVEL. WE'RE ALSO

THAT WE CAN USING THOSE FUNDS.

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:35.841

THOSE BUILDINGS. WE'RE GONNA

02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:56.027

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:56.595
TO UNDERTAKE EVERY ACTIVITY

02:13:56.661 --> 02:13:58.697

02:14:23.555 --> 02:14:24.923
UNDERTAKE THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:26.691
BEING UNDERTAKEN AT DIFFERENT

BUT THAT CONTAIN HIGH LEVELS.

02:15:14.539 --> 02:15:16.408
OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. WHAT WE'VE

02:15:16.475 --> 02:15:18.376

02:15:36.127 --> 02:15:37.262
MORNING AND PORTHLEVEN AT A

02:15:37.329 --> 02:15:38.763
CHANCE TO REVIEW IT BUT WE'RE

02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:40.031
WORKING WITH USEPA WHO'S

02:15:40.098 --> 02:15:42.100
TECHNICALLY AGENCY STILL UNDER

02:15:42.167 --> 02:15:44.469
THE BANKRUPTCY AGREEMENT. AND

02:15:44.536 --> 02:15:45.837

TYPES OF ACTIONS THAT ADDRESS

02:15:49.174 --> 02:15:51.877
THE IMMEDIATE RISKS. TO THE

02:15:51.943 --> 02:15:54.412
EXTENT WE HAVE RESOURCES. OKAY

02:15:54.479 --> 02:15:57.716

02:15:57.782 --> 02:15:59.751
BROADLY DO YOU THINK WE'VE AND

02:15:59.818 --> 02:16:01.653

DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN I MEAN

02:16:07.425 --> 02:16:09.494
WHAT WE KNOW WITHIN THE- WITHIN

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:18.403
THE DEPARTMENT. YEAH. SO- I

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:19.838
HAVE A PHRASE THAT MY STAFF

02:16:19.905 --> 02:16:21.506
GETS REALLY TIRED OF HEARING

02:16:21.573 --> 02:16:22.507
ABOUT WHICH IS BAD NEWS IS GOOD

02:16:22.574 --> 02:16:24.442
NEWS AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS

02:16:24.509 --> 02:16:26.578
THAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT WENT

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:28.213
WRONG IT GIVES YOU THE ABILITY

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:29.748
TO FOCUS IN ON WHAT WENT WRONG

02:16:29.814 --> 02:16:31.216
AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO AVOID IN

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:33.318
THE FUTURE AND SO WE HAVE DONE

02:16:33.385 --> 02:16:37.589
A LOT FOR POST MORTEM ON EXIDE.

02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:38.823
WHICH IS TO SAY THAT WE HAVE

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.959
LOOKED AT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS IT

02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:43.194
ABOUT OUR CURRENT PROCESS THAT

02:16:43.261 --> 02:16:44.229
DIDN'T ALLOW US TO MAKE THAT

02:16:44.296 --> 02:16:46.932
PERMIT DECISION IF WE HAD HAD A

02:16:46.998 --> 02:16:48.033
PERMANENT PLACE WHAT

02:16:48.099 --> 02:16:49.401
PROTECTIONS WITHOUT PERMIT

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:52.437
NEEDED TO HAVE- WE NOW HAVE

02:16:52.504 --> 02:16:53.905
WHAT WE CALL THE VIOLATIONS

02:16:53.972 --> 02:16:55.807
SCORING PROCEDURE WHICH GIVES

02:16:55.874 --> 02:16:58.810
EVERYONE THE VISIBILITY OF HOW

02:16:58.877 --> 02:17:00.011
WELL FACILITIES AROUND THE

STATE PERMITTED FACILITIES ARE

02:17:01.613 --> 02:17:02.714
COMPLYING WITH HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:17:02.781 --> 02:17:05.183
LAWS WE ISSUE A SCORECARD EVERY

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:08.119
SEPTEMBER. AND THAT COULD BE

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:10.322
BASED ON THAT SCORE WE EITHER A

02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:12.958
SIGN OF FACILITY AND

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:14.526
UNACCEPTABLE SCORE

02:17:14.593 --> 02:17:15.827

PUT IN PLACE. IF SOMETIMES IF A

02:17:41.353 --> 02:17:42.954
FACILITY IS IN THE-

02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:45.457
UNACCEPTABLE TEAR WE BEGAN

pTHAT CATEGORY SO THIS IS A NEW

02:18:08.113 --> 02:18:11.816
TOOL FOR US- AND BUT ULTIMATELY

02:18:11.883 --> 02:18:13.518
I THINK THE PERMIT GETTING THE

PERMIT DECISIONS MADE. THAT

02:18:15.587 --> 02:18:21.893

THOSE. WERE WRITTEN IN A WAY

02:18:26.865 --> 02:18:28.099
THAT MAY NOT RISK HOW THAT JUST.

02:18:28.166 --> 02:18:30.669
ARE TODAY'S WE NEED TO KIND TO

02:18:30.735 --> 02:18:33.571

RECEIPT OF AN ACCEPTABLE

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:48.119

02:18:48.186 --> 02:18:49.854
REPUBLICATION THAT'S COME

02:18:49.921 --> 02:18:52.023
ADMINISTRATIVELY COMPLETE WE

02:18:52.090 --> 02:18:53.925
COMMIT TO A TWO YEAR TIME WORK

02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:55.694
TIME FRAME TO GETTING THAT

02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:57.562
PERMIT DECISION MADE SO THAT

02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:59.764
FACILITIES ARE OPERATING ON OUT

02:18:59.831 --> 02:19:01.666
OF BASED ON HOW TO DATE

02:19:01.733 --> 02:19:04.536
UNDERSTANDING. OF THOSE- OF HOW

02:19:04.602 --> 02:19:06.771
THERE THEY WORK BUT THAT ALSO

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:09.207
THEN GIVES US VERY WERE MUCH

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:10.442
CLEARER AND HOW WE WRITE OUR

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:12.243
PERMIT WE'VE HAD A PERMIT

02:19:12.310 --> 02:19:13.545

INSPECTORS ARE TRAINED WE

02:19:20.885 --> 02:19:22.954
ROTATE THEM THROUGH DIFFERENT

02:19:23.021 --> 02:19:24.355
FACILITIES SO THAT THEY DON'T

02:19:24.422 --> 02:19:26.691
GET STALE BY GOING. GOING TO A

02:19:26.758 --> 02:19:28.293

CROSS TRAIN WE STRENGTHEN OUR

02:19:32.697 --> 02:19:33.898
PRESS ONE FORSMAN AND ACTUALLY

02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:36.868
THAT'S A BIG AREA OF FOCUS. NOT

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:38.870
JUST FOR DGSE BUT FOR KELLY P.

02:19:38.937 --> 02:19:41.539
AS A WHOLE- SO THOSE ARE SOME

02:19:41.606 --> 02:19:43.007
OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING AND

02:19:43.074 --> 02:19:44.876
THEN I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT

02:19:44.943 --> 02:19:46.244
WE'RE LOOKING AT FINANCIAL

02:19:46.311 --> 02:19:47.746

PROVISIONS IN NINE NINE FIVE.

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.416
THAT WERE WORTHY OF

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:52.717
CONSIDERATION BUT THERE MAY BE

02:19:52.784 --> 02:19:54.085
THINGS WE CAN GO BEYOND THAT

02:19:54.152 --> 02:19:55.887
WE'RE REALITY CHECKING SOME OF

02:19:55.954 --> 02:19:57.455

TAKES TO CLEAN P A FACILITY

02:20:01.292 --> 02:20:03.328
VERSUS HOW MUCH WE HAD TO YOU

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:04.829
KNOW HOW MUCH HER CALCULATOR

02:20:04.896 --> 02:20:07.198
SAYS IT SHOULD COST. TO MAKE

02:20:07.265 --> 02:20:07.799
SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING GOOD

02:20:07.866 --> 02:20:10.935
ESTIMATES I COULD GO WHICH YEAH

DOLLARS. IN FINANCIAL ASSURANCE

02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:40.865

THESE- CERTAINLY GONNA BE

02:21:07.492 --> 02:21:10.028
HELPFUL- I IT DOES MAKE ME

02:21:10.094 --> 02:21:11.663
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE MAY BE

02:21:11.729 --> 02:21:12.630
DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:21:12.697 --> 02:21:13.865

BANKRUPTCIES WON'T NEED ARE WE

02:21:16.367 --> 02:21:17.368
LOOKING AT TRYING TO BE

CONSIDERED A SECURE CREDITOR SO

02:21:19.103 --> 02:21:21.339
WE GET CLOSER TO THE FRONT LINE

02:21:21.406 --> 02:21:25.210
FOR CLEANUP REIMBURSEMENT-

02:21:25.276 --> 02:21:28.646
SECOND THING SO. I LEARNED A

02:21:28.713 --> 02:21:30.148
LOT AND WE ALL LEARNED A LOT

02:21:30.215 --> 02:21:31.182
ABOUT BANKRUPTCY THROUGH

THROUGH THIS PROCESS NUMBER ONE

02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:34.552
HOW FAST IT MOVES AND NUMBER

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:35.687
TWO WHO GETS TO THE FRONT OF

02:21:35.753 --> 02:21:37.622
THE LINE AND IT IS QUITE

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:40.391
FRANKLY IT'S ALARMING WHO IS

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:41.960
CONSIDERED A SECURED CREDITOR

02:21:42.026 --> 02:21:44.028
AND HOW THEY GET THAT STATUS

02:21:44.095 --> 02:21:46.965
AND ARE THERE IS A PRECEDENT

02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:49.067
KNOWN AS MID ATLANTIC. WHICH

02:21:49.133 --> 02:21:51.135
SHE DOES SAY THAT THEY'RE JUST

02:21:51.202 --> 02:21:52.937
SO BAD OWNERS ARE ALLOWED TO

02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:55.273
ABANDON THEIR PROPERTIES AND

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:56.975
THAT THAT PROVISION IN THIS

02:21:57.041 --> 02:21:58.877
LAND OF PRECEDENT HAS BEEN USED

02:21:58.943 --> 02:22:00.678

THINK THE BANKRUPTCY IS IT IS

02:22:15.326 --> 02:22:17.295
AN AREA OF OPPORTUNITY WILL

02:22:17.362 --> 02:22:18.563
TAKE LEGAL STRATEGY IT WOULD

02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:21.633
TAKE- ALL OF A LOT OF ANALYSIS

02:22:21.699 --> 02:22:23.835

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:46.016
NEEDLESSLY EXPOSED TO LEAD.

02:38:46.083 --> 02:38:47.551
LEAD POISONING IN CHILDREN

02:38:47.618 --> 02:38:49.653
OCCURS AT VERY LOW LEVELS AND

02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:51.388
THERE IS NO CURE FOR LEAD

02:38:51.455 --> 02:38:52.890
POISONING ONCE A CHILD HAS BEEN

02:38:52.956 --> 02:38:56.693
EXPOSED. IT IS PERMANENT AND AS

02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:58.962
A LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES. TO

02:38:59.029 --> 02:39:01.231
EXPOSE CHILD THIS AUDIT

02:39:01.298 --> 02:39:02.566
REPRESENTS A LIFETIME OF

02:39:02.633 --> 02:39:04.635
LEARNING DISABILITIES. A

02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:07.137
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND A

02:39:07.204 --> 02:39:09.973
DIMINISHED OPPORTUNITIES. AND

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.643
EXCITED IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF

02:39:12.709 --> 02:39:13.377
A GROWING CRISIS FACING THE

02:39:13.443 --> 02:39:16.313
STATE. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS

02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:18.115
THERE ARE LIKELY MANY EXCITES

02:39:18.181 --> 02:39:19.983
ACROSS THE STATE SPREADING

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:21.952
TOXICS AND POISONING OUR

02:39:22.019 --> 02:39:25.322
COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE WE

02:39:25.389 --> 02:39:26.423
SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:28.358
CLINICAL THE STATE'S OTHER

02:39:28.425 --> 02:39:30.560
BATTERY RECYCLER WHICH IS ALSO

02:39:30.627 --> 02:39:32.629
LOCATED NEAR RESIDENTIAL

02:39:32.696 --> 02:39:36.333
NEIGHBORHOODS. DDS IS ESTIMATE

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:38.201
OF THE NUMBER OF CONTAMINATED

02:39:38.268 --> 02:39:40.537
SITES IN CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN

02:39:40.604 --> 02:39:43.173
EXPONENTIALLY THIS PAST YEAR.

02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:45.042
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DGSE

02:39:45.108 --> 02:39:48.979
ESTIMATED THAT THERE WEREN'T

02:39:49.046 --> 02:39:49.613
NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.114
IDENTIFIED SITES ACROSS THE

02:39:51.181 --> 02:39:52.983
STATE. AND NOW THE STATE

02:39:53.050 --> 02:39:54.484
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE ARE

02:39:54.551 --> 02:39:57.888
LIKELY OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:39:57.955 --> 02:39:58.922
THOUSAND CONTAMINATED SITES

02:39:58.989 --> 02:40:00.424
WAITING TO BE INVESTIGATED AND

02:40:00.490 --> 02:40:04.895
CHARACTERIZED. A HUNDRED AND

02:40:04.962 --> 02:40:05.462
FIFTY THOUSAND CONTAMINATED

02:40:05.529 --> 02:40:07.664
SITES. AND AT THE SAME TIME

02:40:07.731 --> 02:40:09.299
FUNDING FOR CLEAN UPS HAS ALL

02:40:09.366 --> 02:40:12.002
BUT DRIED UP. EXIDE WILL COST

02:40:12.069 --> 02:40:13.870
THE STATE UPWARDS OF SIX

02:40:13.937 --> 02:40:14.404
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

02:40:14.471 --> 02:40:18.041
DOLLARS. DTCS ENTIRE BUDGET FOR

02:40:18.108 --> 02:40:19.009
OTHER ORPHAN SITES IN

02:40:19.076 --> 02:40:21.878
CALIFORNIA IS BETWEEN FOUR

02:40:21.945 --> 02:40:22.479
FOURTEEN AND EIGHTEEN MILLION

02:40:22.546 --> 02:40:24.614
DOLLARS. EIGHTEEN MILLION

02:40:24.681 --> 02:40:25.615
DOLLARS TO COVER THE STATE'S

02:40:25.682 --> 02:40:27.351
OBLIGATIONS AT TWENTY TWO

02:40:27.417 --> 02:40:29.820
FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND

02:40:29.886 --> 02:40:32.022
FIFTY TWO STATE OR FROM SITES

02:40:32.089 --> 02:40:33.590
EIGHTEEN MILLION ANNUALLY TO

02:40:33.657 --> 02:40:35.826
SPLIT AMONG SEVENTY FOUR

02:40:35.892 --> 02:40:38.962
SEVENTY FOUR SITES. THIS MEANS

02:40:39.029 --> 02:40:41.098
THAT SOME SITES RECEIVE NO

02:40:41.164 --> 02:40:43.600
CLEAN UP FUNDS. IT MEANS THAT

02:40:43.667 --> 02:40:45.602
MANY SUSPECTED SITES DON'T GET

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:48.605
INVESTIGATED. IT MEANS THAT THE

02:40:48.672 --> 02:40:50.207
SITES THAT DO RECEIVE FUNDING

02:40:50.273 --> 02:40:51.942
HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THE CHEAPEST

02:40:52.009 --> 02:40:53.710
CLEANUP OPTION. NOT THE BEST

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:57.014
OPTION. THIS PAST WEEK I

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:58.215
PARTICIPATED IN A PUBLIC

02:40:58.281 --> 02:41:00.417
MEETING TO DISCUSS THE REMEDY

02:41:00.484 --> 02:41:02.786
FOR A P. C. E. T. C. E. PLUME

02:41:02.853 --> 02:41:03.620
IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN

02:41:03.687 --> 02:41:07.190
DELANO WE'RE OFFICE IS LOCATED.

02:41:07.257 --> 02:41:09.192
DGSE CATEGORIZES THE DELANO

02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:12.696
PLUME AS A PRIORITY ONE HEY.

02:41:12.763 --> 02:41:14.498
DETAILS HIS TOP PRIORITY FOR

02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:16.900
CLEAN UP DUE TO AND I QUOTE

02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:20.037
IMMEDIATE AND ACUTE CONDITIONS

02:41:20.103 --> 02:41:21.705
REQUIRING A TIME CRITICAL

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:25.142
RESPONSE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT

02:41:25.208 --> 02:41:27.911
DGSE DISCOVER THE SITE IN TWO

02:41:27.978 --> 02:41:29.613
THOUSAND AND EIGHT OVER TWELVE

02:41:29.679 --> 02:41:32.482
YEARS AGO. AND THEY ARE JAZZ

02:41:32.549 --> 02:41:33.950
NOW SELECTING A REMEDY TO CLEAN

02:41:34.017 --> 02:41:36.987
UP THE SITE. AGAIN DETAILS HIS

02:41:37.054 --> 02:41:38.889
FAILURE TO ACT QUICKLY AND THIS

02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:40.857
LACK OF RESOURCES HAS REAL

02:41:40.924 --> 02:41:43.627
CONSEQUENCES FOR RESIDENTS WHO

02:41:43.693 --> 02:41:44.194
PAY FOR THIS IN ACTION WITH

02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:48.065
THEIR HEALTH. TO CONCLUDE DTS

02:41:48.131 --> 02:41:49.633
IS MANDATE IS INCREDIBLY

02:41:49.699 --> 02:41:50.934
IMPORTANT TO THE STATE AND TO

02:41:51.001 --> 02:41:54.471
THE PUBLIC. DGSE HAS NOT MET

02:41:54.538 --> 02:41:55.572
THAT MANDATE AND CALIFORNIA

02:41:55.639 --> 02:41:57.808
RESIDENTS ARE PAYING A VERY

02:41:57.874 --> 02:42:00.143
HIGH PRICE FOR ITS FAILURES. WE

02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:01.278
NEED BETTER OVERSIGHT AT THE

02:42:01.344 --> 02:42:02.579
AGENCY AND WE NEED T

02:42:02.646 --> 02:42:04.081
SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE THE AMOUNT

02:42:04.147 --> 02:42:05.682
OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO

02:42:05.749 --> 02:42:07.884
INVESTIGATE CHARACTERIZE AND

02:42:07.951 --> 02:42:09.219
REMEDIATE CONTAMINATED SITES IN

02:42:09.286 --> 02:42:11.721
CALIFORNIA. THE SOLUTION

02:42:11.788 --> 02:42:14.958
REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATION AND

02:42:15.025 --> 02:42:15.459
THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK

02:42:15.525 --> 02:42:17.094
TOGETHER. TO WORK

02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:19.596
COLLABORATIVELY AND A FASHION

02:42:19.663 --> 02:42:21.765
AND UP SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMMATIC

02:42:21.832 --> 02:42:24.601
AND FEE REFORMS TO FIX THE TSC.

02:42:24.668 --> 02:42:26.736
AND IF WE CAN'T DO THAT WE NEED

02:42:26.803 --> 02:42:28.738
TO FIND DIFFERENT PATH AND A

02:42:28.805 --> 02:42:30.006
DIFFERENT AGENCY TO MOVE US

02:42:30.073 --> 02:42:34.311
FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

WERE HOLDING NOT ONLY

02:42:39.015 --> 02:42:40.217
DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE BUT

02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:41.952
TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

02:42:42.018 --> 02:42:42.486
TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES ARE

02:42:42.552 --> 02:42:44.421
AFFECTED. WITH THAT LET'S GO

02:42:44.488 --> 02:42:46.223

WILLIAMS I ACTUALLY CHAIRED THE

02:43:06.543 --> 02:43:08.945
TECHNICAL COMMITTEE OF THE

02:43:09.012 --> 02:43:12.349
EXITE CAG. AND IT'S DIFFICULT

02:43:12.415 --> 02:43:13.650
TO PUT INTO WORDS JUST HOW

02:43:13.717 --> 02:43:14.985
INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED THE

02:43:15.051 --> 02:43:16.720
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED

02:43:16.786 --> 02:43:19.122
BY THIS LEAD CONTAMINATION ARE-

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:21.291
I THINK THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:23.760
SANTIAGO IS DONE A GOOD JOB OF

02:43:23.827 --> 02:43:26.530
TRYING TO PUT THAT INTO WORDS-

02:43:26.596 --> 02:43:28.431
IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDER

02:43:28.498 --> 02:43:28.999
ESTIMATE EXACTLY WHAT'S AT

02:43:29.065 --> 02:43:31.434
STAKE HERE- YOU KNOW WE TALK

02:43:31.501 --> 02:43:32.969
ABOUT THE POVERTY TO PRISON

02:43:33.036 --> 02:43:34.404
PIPELINE WILL HERE WE'VE GOT

02:43:34.471 --> 02:43:37.007
THE POISON TO PRISON PIPELINE.

02:43:37.073 --> 02:43:38.975
IT TAKES ONLY A PEN HEAD OF

02:43:39.042 --> 02:43:41.311
LEAD TO HAVE A CHILD EXCEED TO

02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:43.013
SEE YOU SEE YOU BROTHER LOVERS

02:43:43.079 --> 02:43:45.081

02:43:45.148 --> 02:43:47.250
THAT BASICALLY HAVE A THOUSAND

02:43:47.317 --> 02:43:48.118
PARTS PER MILLION IN THEIR

02:43:48.185 --> 02:43:52.622
YARDS. WHICH IS BASICALLY

02:43:52.689 --> 02:43:53.223
THEY'RE LIVING IN A HAZARDOUS

02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:54.257
WASTE LANDFILL. WHAT HAPPENED

02:43:54.324 --> 02:43:56.426
HERE WAS A CLASSIC

02:43:56.493 --> 02:43:57.928
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROBLEM

02:43:57.994 --> 02:44:00.764
WHERE- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:03.300
REDLINED USE REDLINING POLICIES

02:44:03.366 --> 02:44:05.168
TO CONCENTRATE LEAD SMELTERS IN

02:44:05.235 --> 02:44:07.804
EAST LA. EXCITE IS NOT THE ONLY

02:44:07.871 --> 02:44:09.439
LETS MALTER THERE'S ACTUALLY

02:44:09.506 --> 02:44:12.175
SIX LEAD SMELTERS. IN EAST LA

02:44:12.242 --> 02:44:13.977
AND WE HAVE DONE AN ANALYSIS

02:44:14.044 --> 02:44:15.378
CALLED A CLEANING ANALYSIS

02:44:15.445 --> 02:44:16.980
WHERE WE LOOK AT. OUR THE

02:44:17.047 --> 02:44:18.415
LEVELS AS WE GO AWAY FROM

02:44:18.481 --> 02:44:19.883
EXCITED DROPPING OFF AND THE

02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:21.785
ANSWER IS NO THEY'RE NOT. AND

02:44:21.851 --> 02:44:23.353
THAT'S BECAUSE EXCITED IS AT

02:44:23.420 --> 02:44:25.255
THE CENTER AND THE OTHER OTHER

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:29.025
LEAD SMELTERS ARE LIKE IN A

02:44:29.092 --> 02:44:31.861
RACE AROUND EACH- EXIDE IS TO

02:44:31.928 --> 02:44:33.797
OUR KNOWLEDGE THE LONGEST

02:44:33.863 --> 02:44:35.298
OPERATING THAT'S FILTER IN THE

02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:45.875
COUNTRY. SO IT COULD BE. A

02:44:45.942 --> 02:44:48.311
LARGE PROBLEM AND IT FRUSTRATES

02:44:48.378 --> 02:44:50.580
ME TO NO END AND THE MEMBERS OF

02:44:50.647 --> 02:44:53.783
THE- COMMITTEE TO NO END THAT.

02:44:53.850 --> 02:44:56.953
THIS KEEPS THE DETAILS HE KEEPS

02:44:57.020 --> 02:44:57.520
TALKING ABOUT THE ONE POINT

02:44:57.587 --> 02:45:00.090
SEVEN MILES. NEAR THE THIRTY

02:45:00.156 --> 02:45:01.458
TWO HUNDRED HOMES THE FORTY SIX

02:45:01.524 --> 02:45:02.759
HUNDRED HOMES THE SIX HUNDRED

02:45:02.826 --> 02:45:04.628
AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS

02:45:04.694 --> 02:45:05.895
IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN

02:45:05.962 --> 02:45:08.198
THAT THIS IS A HUNDRED YEAR

02:45:08.265 --> 02:45:09.666
HISTORY OF ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM

02:45:09.733 --> 02:45:12.269
EAST LA THAT WILL MOST LIKELY

02:45:12.335 --> 02:45:14.671
IMPACT A MILLION PEOPLE AND

02:45:14.738 --> 02:45:17.040
SPREAD FOR SQUARE MILES. AND

02:45:17.107 --> 02:45:18.441
THAT IS WHY WE WORKED WITH

02:45:18.508 --> 02:45:19.843
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRISSY AND THE

02:45:19.909 --> 02:45:21.578
SPEAKER TO PASS THE BATTERY FEE

02:45:21.645 --> 02:45:23.613
BILL. WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.048
HEARING AT RESURRECTION CHURCH

02:45:25.115 --> 02:45:26.416
ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR AND

02:45:26.483 --> 02:45:28.418
WE TALKED ABOUT THE TWO THINGS

02:45:28.485 --> 02:45:29.719
THAT WE NEED FOR THE EXCITING

02:45:29.786 --> 02:45:31.421
TECH TO COMMUNITIES WE NEED A

02:45:31.488 --> 02:45:33.156
LONG TERM STABLE SOURCE OF

02:45:33.223 --> 02:45:34.391
FUNDING. WHICH IS WHAT THE

02:45:34.457 --> 02:45:36.393
BATTERY FEE BILL IS DESIGNED TO

02:45:36.459 --> 02:45:39.663
DO. AND WE NEED A DIVORCE. WE

02:45:39.729 --> 02:45:42.899
NEED A DIVORCE FROM DGSE. DGSE

02:45:42.966 --> 02:45:44.534
WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED HIM IT

02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:46.670
MAY INTEREST YOU AS A WASTE

02:45:46.736 --> 02:45:49.939
MANAGEMENT AGENCY. THEY ARE NOT

02:45:50.006 --> 02:45:52.008
A PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY. IT

02:45:52.075 --> 02:45:54.611
CANNOT BE MORE CLEAR. WHEN YOU

02:45:54.678 --> 02:45:56.046
HEAR THE DIRECTOR SAID THAT

02:45:56.112 --> 02:45:58.848
PARKING IS THE PROBLEM FOR WHY

02:45:58.915 --> 02:46:00.350
WE CAN'T GET MORE PEOPLE INTO

02:46:00.417 --> 02:46:02.085
DOING MORE CLEANUPS THAT THIS

02:46:02.152 --> 02:46:04.087
AGENCY IT HAS NOT BEEN IN THE

02:46:04.154 --> 02:46:05.989
PAST AND IT IS NOT NOW REALLY

02:46:06.056 --> 02:46:07.424
DEDICATED ITSELF TO SOLVING

02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:10.026
THIS PROBLEM- YOU KNOW FIRST.

02:46:10.093 --> 02:46:11.861
THE AGENCY WE COMPLAIN THAT

02:46:11.928 --> 02:46:13.029
THEY DON'T HAVE AUTHORITIES

02:46:13.096 --> 02:46:14.030
WHILE YOU'RE TALKING TO THE

IT IF THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS

WE REALLY HAD SOME ISSUES WITH

02:55:26.048 --> 02:55:27.550

A SHORTAGE WITH THAT THE-

02:56:02.151 --> 02:56:03.886

THAT RESPONSE- A LITTLE BIT

02:56:57.573 --> 02:56:59.809
EARLY SO THAT I COULD PROVIDE.

FOR A WORKERS COMP. OR DIVISION

02:57:07.049 --> 02:57:08.851
WORKERS CAPTURES ME- CAN CAN

02:57:08.918 --> 02:57:09.952
GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE

02:57:10.019 --> 02:57:11.554
WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A ONE

02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:12.888
YEAR RESPONSE OTHER RESPONSES

02:57:12.955 --> 02:57:14.890
I'M REFERRING TO. ARE THE SIX

02:57:14.957 --> 02:57:16.492
MONTH RESPONSE THAT WE RECEIVED

02:57:16.559 --> 02:57:19.028
IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR. SO AS OF

02:57:19.095 --> 02:57:22.665
JUNE- WE FELT THAT THE STATUS

02:57:22.732 --> 02:57:26.268
OF. BWC THIS RECOMMENDATION TO

02:57:26.335 --> 02:57:27.470
REALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

02:57:27.536 --> 02:57:29.605
Q. ANNE'S IS REALLY AS WE CALL

02:57:29.672 --> 02:57:31.741
IT PENDING. SO BASICALLY WHAT

02:57:31.807 --> 02:57:33.175
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS THEY

02:57:33.242 --> 02:57:34.543
HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR A SEVERAL

02:57:34.610 --> 02:57:36.012
DIFFERENT WAYS THEY INTEND TO

02:57:36.078 --> 02:57:37.913
RECRUIT MORE Q. ANNE'S. BUT

02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:39.115
REALLY HAVEN'T MOVED FORWARD

02:57:39.181 --> 02:57:41.350
WITH THAT PROCESS. ONE

02:57:41.417 --> 02:57:42.852
IMPORTANT ISSUE I KNOW MEMBERS

02:57:42.918 --> 02:57:44.520
WHO WERE WORKING ON LAST YEAR

02:57:44.587 --> 02:57:46.522
THERE WAS SOME LEGISLATION. WAS

02:57:46.589 --> 02:57:48.324
RELATED TO THE FEES THAT

02:57:48.391 --> 02:57:50.159
COMMUNITIES CAN CHARGE AS WE

02:57:50.226 --> 02:57:51.827
INDICATED IN THE AUDIT REPORT

02:57:51.894 --> 02:57:53.162
THOSE FEES HAD NOT BEEN UPDATED

02:57:53.229 --> 02:57:55.364
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. SO

02:57:55.431 --> 02:57:57.666
THEY THEY NEED UPDATING OUR

02:57:57.733 --> 02:58:00.202
SOON BECAUSE EVEN WITH JUST THE

02:58:00.269 --> 02:58:02.238
CPI IF YOU USE JUST A AN

02:58:02.304 --> 02:58:04.040
INFLATION INDICATOR. THOSE FEES

02:58:04.106 --> 02:58:05.441
WOULD GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY

02:58:05.508 --> 02:58:08.110
BECAUSE OF SUCH. SUCH A LONG

02:58:08.177 --> 02:58:10.046
TIME. SO WE HAD ONE ONE KEY

02:58:10.112 --> 02:58:11.447
RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THE

02:58:11.514 --> 02:58:13.249
SHORTAGE OF Q. AMIS REALLY GOT

02:58:13.315 --> 02:58:14.350
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

02:58:14.417 --> 02:58:15.284
COMMUNITIES ADDRESS THAT FEE

02:58:15.351 --> 02:58:18.220
SCHEDULE. LOOK TO SEE WHERE

02:58:18.287 --> 02:58:20.322
THAT THE SPECIALTIES ARE THAT

02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:23.359
NEED. TO BE INCREASED BECAUSE

02:58:23.426 --> 02:58:24.660
THEY ARE DOING ANY KIND OF

02:58:24.727 --> 02:58:26.829
ANALYSIS BASED ON SPECIALTY.

02:58:26.896 --> 02:58:27.730
ALSO WE FELT THAT THEY NEEDED

02:58:27.797 --> 02:58:30.066
TO DO THAT. THE DUE PROCESS

02:58:30.132 --> 02:58:31.634
ISSUE AS FAR AS SEPARATING

02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:33.736
DISCIPLINE FROM REAPPOINTMENT

02:58:33.803 --> 02:58:35.204
WE HAD TWO RECOMMENDATIONS

02:58:35.271 --> 02:58:37.073
THERE ONE WE FEEL THAT THEY'VE

02:58:37.139 --> 02:58:39.108
PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED WHAT WE

02:58:39.175 --> 02:58:40.843
RECOMMEND IS THAT THEY DEVELOP

02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:42.078
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

02:58:42.144 --> 02:58:44.046
REALLY. DEFINE THEIR INTERNAL

02:58:44.113 --> 02:58:45.815
PROCESSES FOR DISCIPLINE VERSUS

02:58:45.881 --> 02:58:48.284
REAPPOINTMENT AND ESTABLISHING

02:58:48.350 --> 02:58:50.519
TIMELINES FOR DISCIPLINARY

02:58:50.586 --> 02:58:52.388
ACTION WHAT WE FOUND IS- SOME

02:58:52.455 --> 02:58:53.789
Q. AND THESE WERE REQUESTING A

02:58:53.856 --> 02:58:56.025
HEARING TO. PRESENT THEIR CASE

02:58:56.092 --> 02:58:57.660
AND IT WAS TAKING DIVISION OF

02:58:57.726 --> 02:58:59.195
WORKERS COMP- LONG TIME TO GET

02:58:59.261 --> 02:59:00.863
THOSE HEARING SET UP THE CUNY

02:59:00.930 --> 02:59:02.565
WOULD JUST AGREE TO SETTLE SO

02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:03.599
THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO

02:59:03.666 --> 02:59:05.534
FUNCTION AS A Q. AND ME. SO WE

02:59:05.601 --> 02:59:06.402
FELT THAT THERE WERE SOME

02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:07.770
SIGNIFICANT DUE PROCESS

02:59:07.837 --> 02:59:09.872
CONCERNS THERE. OUR CONCLUSION

02:59:09.939 --> 02:59:11.507
AT THE SIX MONTH RESPONSE AGAIN

02:59:11.574 --> 02:59:14.110
BACK IN JUNE. IS THAT THEY HAVE

02:59:14.176 --> 02:59:15.978
DEVELOPED A POLICY. BUT THEY'RE

02:59:16.045 --> 02:59:17.246
NOT REQUIRING THEY'RE NOT

02:59:17.313 --> 02:59:18.614
ENFORCING IT AND REQUIRING

02:59:18.681 --> 02:59:20.216
THEIR STAFF TO FALL THAT POLICY

02:59:20.282 --> 02:59:24.553
SO REALLY NOT A LOT OF PROGRESS

02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:25.154
HAS BEEN MADE WITH RESPECT TO

02:59:25.221 --> 02:59:26.188
THAT. THE OTHERRECOMMENDATION

02:59:26.255 --> 02:59:27.857
WAS TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND

02:59:27.923 --> 02:59:29.391
PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO RE

02:59:29.458 --> 02:59:31.093
APPOINTMENT SO AS OPPOSED TO

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:32.795
DISCIPLINE WHAT KIND OF

02:59:32.862 --> 02:59:33.529
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SHOULD

02:59:33.596 --> 02:59:35.698
THEY HAVE FOR. ASSURING THAT

02:59:35.764 --> 02:59:36.465
THEY THEIR REAPPOINTMENT

02:59:36.532 --> 02:59:38.734
PROCESS FOR CUNY'S IS FAIR AND

THE QUALITY OF REPORTS WE MADE

02:59:55.684 --> 02:59:57.686
FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST WE

02:59:57.753 --> 03:00:00.422
WANTED THEM TO CREATE A PLAN TO

03:00:00.489 --> 03:00:02.458
CONTINUOUS REVIEW- THE QUALITY

03:00:09.532 --> 03:00:11.167
THOSE REPORTS. RATHER THAN

03:00:11.233 --> 03:00:12.668
ASKING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL

03:00:12.735 --> 03:00:14.003

THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE

03:34:23.584 --> 03:34:25.185
MONITORED VERY CLOSELY. I KNOW

03:34:25.252 --> 03:34:27.988
THAT A NUMBER OF EVALUATOR

03:34:28.055 --> 03:34:29.523
SPECIALTY EVALUATORS TELL ME

03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:30.157
THAT THE FEE SCHEDULES NOT

03:34:30.224 --> 03:34:33.227
ADEQUATE FOR THEM. AND SO EVEN

03:34:33.293 --> 03:34:34.094
THOUGH THERE ARE A MINORITY

03:34:34.161 --> 03:34:35.395
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW

03:34:35.462 --> 03:34:37.364
CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO

03:34:37.431 --> 03:34:40.033
THE OVERALL. AVAILABILITY OF

03:34:40.100 --> 03:34:41.969
CUNY'S. MY BIGGEST CONCERN

03:34:42.035 --> 03:34:43.904
RIGHT NOW IS THAT. THE BE

03:34:43.971 --> 03:34:44.605
FURTHER DELAYS IN THE

03:34:44.671 --> 03:34:46.173
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEDULE

03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:47.341
IT'S ALREADY PUSHED OUT TO

03:34:47.407 --> 03:34:48.875
APRIL FIRST I'M NOT SURE WHY

03:34:48.942 --> 03:34:50.844
THAT IS. IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD

03:34:50.911 --> 03:34:51.812
HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL

03:34:51.878 --> 03:34:54.114
MONTHS BEFORE THAT. I'M AFRAID

03:34:54.181 --> 03:34:54.681
IS GOING TO BE EVEN FURTHER

03:34:54.748 --> 03:34:56.450
DELAYS BECAUSE OF. PRESSURE

03:34:56.516 --> 03:34:58.752
FROM PAYERS. I KNOW THAT-

03:34:58.819 --> 03:35:00.721

FIFTEEN YEARS. I'M ALSO

03:35:05.726 --> 03:35:07.527
CONCERNED THAT THEIR CERTAIN

03:35:07.594 --> 03:35:08.929
PROVISIONS IN THE FEE SCHEDULE

03:35:08.996 --> 03:35:09.830
THAT THAT REALLY NEED TO BE

03:35:09.896 --> 03:35:10.897

03:35:10.964 --> 03:35:12.899
CLARIFY THERE'S GOING TO BE

03:35:12.966 --> 03:35:13.500
GREATLY INCREASED FRICTIONAL

03:35:13.567 --> 03:35:16.303
COSTS. NOT SURE THE WC THINKING

03:35:16.370 --> 03:35:19.106
IS ON THESE- ON THESE PARTS OF

03:35:19.172 --> 03:35:21.475
THE PROPOSAL. WE'VE DISCUSSED

03:35:21.541 --> 03:35:23.277

HOPEFULLY THE D. W. C. WILL

03:35:27.214 --> 03:35:28.548
CHOOSE TO CLARIFY SOME OF THESE

03:35:28.615 --> 03:35:29.483
PROVISIONS IT'S NOT A QUESTION

03:35:29.549 --> 03:35:30.717
OF ELIMINATING THEM IS JUST A

03:35:30.784 --> 03:35:33.086
QUESTION OF MAKING SURE THAT

03:35:33.153 --> 03:35:33.620
THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE

03:35:33.687 --> 03:35:35.689
