HOPE YOU TAKE A QUESTION- SO.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:48.561
THE IGEST OF YOUR BILL SAYS

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:49.962
THAT IT REQUIRES CALVET

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.230
CORPORATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

EQUIPPING- FOR THIS CEMETERY.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:00.773
AND THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING LAW

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.675
SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE BILL

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.244
DO. BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT THE

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:06.912
DIGESTIVE TELLS ME WHEN IT DOES

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:07.980
BUT YOU SAID SOMETHING A LITTLE

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:09.848
DIFFERENT IN YOUR OPENING SO I

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:11.850
JUST WONDER WHERE IN THE BILL.

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:12.651
IS THERE SOMETHING I'M NOT

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:16.388
SEEING SO I THINK IF YOU LOOK

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:20.326
AT- IF YOU HAVE A BILLING FIVE

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.228
PAGE TWO. IF YOU LOOK AT

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:24.430
SECTION ONE WHERE IT SAYS

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.599
FOURTEEN TEN. EIGHTY ONE THE

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.300
BOTTOM IT SAYS IN THE CITY OF

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.402
IRVINE ACCORDING TO THE CITY'S

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.304
ENACTED LAWS AND ORDINANCES.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.707
MISSY THAT FORTUNE YES SO WHAT

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:36.742
THE CONTROVERSY HAS BEEN- RIGHT

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:38.043
I DON'T THINK IT'S A REAL

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.545
CONTROVERSY BUT THE CONTROVERSY

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:41.380
HAS BEEN AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:43.349
CALVET OR THE CITY OF IRVINEIS

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:44.750
GOING TO CHOOSE A LOCATION.

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:47.553
WITHIN THE CITY OF IRVINE- THIS

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.421
BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IN THE

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.490
CITY OF IRVINE. THAT THE CITY

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.125
WILL CHOOSE LOCATION IN

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:54.426
ACCORDANCE WITH ITS ENACTED

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:57.796
LAWS AND ORDINANCES- WE'VE

00:14:57.863 --> 00:14:59.598
WE'VE ASKED CALVET TO MAKE IT

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.400
VERY CLEAR THAT CALVET IS NOT

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:02.468
GOING TO MAKE THAT CHOICE THAT

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:03.636
CITIES CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.537
BUT- THERE'S BEEN SOME.

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.439
RELUCTANCE TO DO SO THAT'S WHAT

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:09.642
THIS BILL DOES. OKAY BUT THE

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:13.912
BILL DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY.

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:16.282
THE CITY ONLY WILL CHOOSE THE

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:18.183
LOCATION AND NOT COUNT THAT

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.685
WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.054
SAYING THAT THE ISSUE IS RIGHT

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.923
THAT'S CORRECT WHAT IT SAYS IS-

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.125
THAT THE STATE OPERATED

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:27.459
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.495
CEMETERY WHICH SHALL BE LOCATED

ACCORDANCE WITH THE CITY'S

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:39.071
ENACTED LAWS AND ORDINANCES.

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:45.511
OKAY- OKAY IJUST I YOU KNOW I

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:48.714
AM FAMILIAR WITH THIS ISSUE-

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.817
AND I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:54.053
KIND OF THE PING PONG. THAT'S

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:55.187
BEEN TAKING PLACE IN ORANGE

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:57.256

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.158
CEMETERY WHICH IS-

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.826
DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.895
BECAUSE- RIVERSIDE NATIONAL

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:06.265
SERVICE THE MAJORITY OF. THE

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:09.268
VETERANS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:13.172
LOS ANGELES IS EVEN ACCEPTING-

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:15.474
PEOPLE NOW I QUIT UNDER VERY

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.510
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WE DO

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:21.447

GUESS AT. I AM VERY CONFUSED AS

I'M SURE YOU MUST BE AS TO WHY

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.221
THE CITY AND CALVET AND

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:30.489
EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED CAN'T

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:32.391
COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:34.360
BECAUSE THIS IS TAKING. A VERY

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:36.395
LONG TIME AND I THINK YOU KNOW

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:38.397

VETERANS FOR SERVICE IN- I

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.534
THINK YOUR ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:43.836
THAN WORDS THE BEST WAY TO

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:45.404
THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE TO

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:46.605
PROVIDE A PLACE FOR THEM FOR

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.875

DOESN'T APPEAR THAT IT DOES

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.484
ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN IT'S

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.818
ALREADY BEING DONE BUT IF IT

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:07.359
USE YOUR INFLUENCE TO CONVINCE

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.194
THEM THAT THEY SHOULD STOP

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.796

IS THAT- WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.246
AS A STATE. UNTIL THE CITY OF

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:29.348

SUPPORTED THE MOTION. CALVET

00:17:57.876 --> 00:18:00.012

CALVET IS GOING TO DO A STUDY.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.920
AND PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR THE

DECISION TO BE MADE. WELL THANK

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:12.491
YOU FOR THAT- AND I THINK THE

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:15.427
VOTERS ALREADY SPOKE ABOUT THIS

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:15.994
ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO BE

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:18.797
DONE SELL. ITEMS YES I THINK

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:20.999
THAT'S TRUE- I THINK THERE'S

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:24.269
ALREADY- ORDINANCES ENACTED

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:27.773
BUT- THIS IS TO. ELIMINATE ANY

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.808
ISSUE AS TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:32.010
FOR CHOOSING A LOCATION OKAY

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:35.581
AND JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY DOES-

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:36.915
NO RELATION TO HOW I WOULD VOTE

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:39.751
ON THE BILL BUT- GIVE ANY IDEA

00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:41.854
HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.622
STUDYING HIS AND PROVIDING

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:45.657

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:47.693
TO THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW UP

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:48.894
TO THIS POINT I DO KNOW THAT

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.362
THAT THERE WAS A STUDY THAT'S

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.663
BEING CONDUCTED RIGHT NOW THAT

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.565
I THINK THEE WAS SEVEN HUNDRED

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.233
THOUSAND DOLLARS APPROPRIATE

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.168
FOR THAT STUDY YES YEAH. OKAY

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:57.236

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:58.971
OF MONEY SPENT WITH NOTHING TO

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.172
