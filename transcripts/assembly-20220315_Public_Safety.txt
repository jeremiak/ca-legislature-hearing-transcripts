DRUG TREATMENT STANDARDS. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BE AND I THINK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY. I FIRST WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS AND AMENDMENTS I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW SECTION ONE ONE THREE SEVEN THREE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE STATES THAT WHENEVER ANY PERSON WHO'S GRANTED PROBATION BY THE TRIAL COURT AFTER CONVICTION FOR VIOLATION OF ANY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE OFFENSE. THE TRIAL COURT SHELL AS A CONDITION OF PROBATION ORDER THAT PERSON SECURE EDUCATION OR TREATMENT FROM A LOCAL COMMUNITY AGENCY DESIGNATED BY THE COURT IF THE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE AND IF THE PERSON IS LIKEL TO BENEFIT FROM THE SERVICE. HOWEVER THIS SECTION IS VAGUE ON WHAT THESE EDUCATION PROGRAMS MUST SPECIFICALLY ENTAIL. FURTHERMORE SECTION TWELVE ELEVEN OF THE PENAL CODE CONTAINS LITERALLY ONE SENTENCE ABOUT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING PROGRAMS AND STATES IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST TWENTY HOURS OF INSTRUCTION. THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL THE STATE CURRENTLY SAYS ON THESE CRUCIAL SERVICES. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY IS A SIMPLE MEASURE TO SIMPLY REQUIRE THE COUNTY DRUG ADMINISTERED WORK WITH MEMBERS OF THE COURT PROBATION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ADVOCATES TO DETERMINE WHAT STANDARDS AND INFORMATION COULD BE INCLUDED IN ANY COUNSELING. OR EDUCATION PROGRAMS REQUIRED BY THE COURT AS A CONDITION OF PROBATION. MEMBERS WE KNOW THAT DRUG ADDICTION IS IN A CRIME IT'S NOT ILLNESS SOME ADDICTED TO DRUGS MAY NEVER FULLY GET OVER THIS ADDICTION. HOWEVER WE ALSO MUST REALIZE THAT THE BEST WAY TO HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS IS TO GET THEM WITH PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN SHOW THEM HOW TO MANAGE THEIR ADDICTION. UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IT MAKES NO SENSE TO HAVE THE COURTS REQUIRE COUNSELLING AND NOT HAVE STATUTORY LEADING LANGUAGE OUTLINING WHAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN THESE PROGRAMS. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS BY NO MEANS DOES IT LIMIT WHAT THE TREATMENTS COULD BE. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY GIVE STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL SIDES A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO HELP DETERMINE WHAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO WHEN IT COMES TO THE COUNSELING AND EDUCATION FOR INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE VIOLATIONS. WITH ME HERE TODAY VIA PHONE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS R. PAT ESPINOSA AND ROBERT HIGH TOWER. AND I ASKED FOR NOT A VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

EXCELLENT MY NAME IS PATRICK ESPINOZA I'M CHIEF DEPUTY IN THIS ANNUAL COUNTY JUST ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE SAN DIEGO DA'S OFFICE IS PROUD TO SUPPORT EIGHTY SEVEN TEN FIFTY AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS BUT THAT NOT CRISIS. THERE ARE MANY APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THE FEDERAL CRISIS AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOCUSES ON PROVIDING EDUCATION AND TREATMENT TO INDIVIDUALS PLACED ON PROBATION. FOR A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE THANKS THE EDUCATION WOULD INCLUDE LECTURES CLASSES GROUP DISCUSSIONS AND COUNSELING THE GOAL OF EDUCATION TREATMENT IS TO STOP CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE USE AND SAVE LIVES BY EDUCATING INDIVIDUALS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ABOUT THE RISKS AND DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES SUCH AS THE ALARMING INCREASE IN THE BE THOU THE EMPLOYABILITY. OF FAKE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. OKAY CHRISTIAN PILLS CAN SET. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ONE THE PUBLIC ABOUT IT SIGNIFICANT NATIONWIDE SURGEON COUNTERCULT THEY'RE MASS PRODUCED. BY CRIMINAL DRUG NETWORKS DECEPTIVELY MARKETED AS LEGITIMATE PRESCRIPTION PILLS AND ARE KILLING UNSUSPECTING AMERICANS. IN THE LAST WEEK SIX MEN AND A WOMAN SUFFERED FEDERAL OVERDOSED AT A FLORIDA VACATION HOME DURING SPRING BREAK THEY'RE USING COCAINE THAT WAS LACED WITH THAT AND ALL. FIVE OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE REPORTED TO BE WEST POINT CADETS. AN EXAMPLE THE REPORT SAN DIEGO COUNTY CASE INVOLVING NINE ONE ONE CALL TO REPORT AN- UNRESPONSIVE NINETEEN YEAR OLD MALE. MEDICS ARRIVED AND ATTEMPTED TO REVIVE THE YOUNG MAN BEFORE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE YOUNG MAN HAD USED COCAINE AND ECSTASY. PREVIOUS NIGHT DETECTIVES DUG IN IDENTIFIED THE PERSON WHO PROVIDED THE COCAINE ECSTASY AND DETERMINED THAT THE PERSON BOUGHT PILLS. THAT TESTED POSITIVE. BUT NOT AND GAVE THE FEEL SO YOUNG MAN WHO DIED. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THROUGH THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE BUT NO RELATED DEATHS SINCE IN YOUR COUNTY ACCORDING TO OUR MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE. THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY ONE BUT NO RELATED DEATHS IN OUR COUNTY IN TWENTY TWENTY TRIPLE THE NUMBER FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR WE BELIEVE. THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TOTAL COUNT WILL BE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED DEATHS ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX DEATHS RELATED TO FENTANYL OVERDOSE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY. BUT NOW IT'S ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE. FIFTY TIMES STRONGER THAN HEROIN ADDICT SUFFERING FROM OPIOID ADDICTION DON'T REALIZE THE- JESTING A FATAL DOSE. SAN DIEGO DIEGO. IS ATTACKING THE PROBLEM IN SUB FRONTS. WORKING TO.

I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT AND IF THE LEGISLATION IS THE EDUCATION THAT WILL PROVIDE THIS WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TOOL TO COURT AND THE COUNSELORS TO ADD THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN DAVIES PUT IT HELP INDIVIDUALS MANAGE THEIR ADDICTION AS WE KNOW THERE IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL PROGRAM THAT CAN READ INDIVIDUALS FROM THE CRIPPLING. EFFECTS OF DRUG AND OPIOID ADDICTION HOWEVER- AND WE HAVE SEEN IN THE ONGOING CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING WHAT HAS REALLY BEEN A HIDDEN PANDEMIC- IS THAT OFTENTIMES A DRUG THAT WERE ORIGINALLY NOT LEGAL IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM HAVE BEEN LACED WITH PRODUCTS THAT ARE- AND THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE COURT AS WELL AS PROBATION OFFICERS IN TREATMENT COUNSELORS WITH AN ADDITIONAL TOOL I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON ONE THING THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP. BY SOME OF THOSE OPPOSED TO THE BILL I WHICH WHAT IN THE COURT I'M NOT RESPECTFULLY I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK THIS PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL TOOL OF THAT COURT INFORMATION OFFICERS% AND COUNSELORS CAN USE IN ORDER TO ASSIST THOSE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE TREATMENT PROCESS WHICH IS OFTEN UP AND DOWN A PROCESS SO I THINK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT AND I ASK ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION.

THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT APPROVING THE AND- IN DESIGNING THE PROGRAMS WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EDGE- THAT pTHE EDUCATION PROPONENT OF THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD HAVE I'M MANDATORY EDUCATION ABOUT THE DANGERS OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AS WELL AS WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LANGUAGE AROUND TO SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT- THE INCLUSION OF THE LANGUAGE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION IN THE BILL- I SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITION AND SO THE NATURE OF INCLUDING. LANGUAGE I HAVE- SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION DOES NOT FIT WITH THAT YOU KNOW MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY IN THE WAY OF TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WE'D RATHER SEE THAT THE LANGUAGE SAY THAT THE PERSON MUST PARTICIPATE IN A- CAN EDUCATE CONTROLLED EDUCATION OR TREATMENT PROGRAM RATHER THAN SAYING THE LANGUAGE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ORDER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN A ROOM IN OPPOSITION. POLICE IN LEWIS ON BEHALF OF DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. FRED WILLIAMS ARE WE HAVE A SO YOU CATCH ACTION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MARC COACH GEORGE- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK THANK YOU.

IN OPPOSITION OF AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO OF AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY. AND ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE WE GIVE THEM MY NUMBER. AS A REMINDER WE IN OPPOSITION OF AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY. AND WE WILL GO LINE AT YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE MORNING JERRY MEMBERS THIS IS pJUSTICE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AN EXTRA LINE OF EIGHTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS THE EVER SHE'D WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION LOOKING FOR CONTINUE CONVERSATION WITH AUTHORS OFFICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER% CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THE DATA THANK YOU- WE'RE NOT BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS CONCERNS. MR LACKEY YEAH THE OPPOSITION EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE TERM SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION. CAN YOU ARTICULATE WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM AND THEN REFER THAT TO MY WITNESSES TO. EITHER. ESPINOZA HIGHTOWER BUT- YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN. YEAH THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT FORWARD THE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TERM SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION WHAT WOULD JUSTIFY SUCCESSFUL. COMPLETION OR WHAT WOULD QUALIFY. AFTER SERVICES ROBERT HIGHTOWER WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I THINK THAT'S FULL COMPLETION IS THAT THE WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT THAT IS LANGUAGE IT IS CURRENTLY USED AT OTHER PLACES IN THE CODE SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO PROBATION CONDITION- A LOT OF TIMES THE COURT WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE BUT FINANCIALLY COMPLIED WITH THE TERMS- OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD COMPLETED THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF HOURS. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING LIKE WHERE THEY HAVE TO PASS A TEST OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGES- AND THEY HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THIS WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR EXAMPLE WITH RESPECT TO. DIVERSION PROGRAMS. FOR MENTAL HEALTH THAT COME DIRECTLY NUMBER OF HOURS- THAT USUALLY IF SUFFICIENT FOR THE COURT BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN IN MY EXPERIENCE. THAT COURT SOMETIMES EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF HOURS WE'LL FIND SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE AND ALLOW THEM TO HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE. SO IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE STATING THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY ATTENDANCE. NOT BY ANY OTHER CRITERIA. THAT'S CORRECT AND IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF ALREADY EXISTING CLASSES IN TREATMENT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO PASS A PASTOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT ASSEMBLY HAVE TO ATTEND THE CLASSES AND COMPLETE THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF HOURS. YEAH BECAUSE THE INFERENCES THAT SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION MEANS THAT THEY HAVE OVERCOME THE ADDICTION AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS WHAT- IS BEING. ALLEGED HERE MY RIGHT. I WOULD COMPLETELY AGREE SIR IN FACT I WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO SAY OFTENTIMES IN DRUG COURT FOR EXAMPLE. THE TERM OVERCOMING OR BEING SUCCESSFUL WITH AN ADDICTION IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS ACHIEVABLE ADDICTION AND I'M SURE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- WHERE ADDICTION SOMETHING THAT OF LIFELONG- AND FILL INDIVIDUALS SIMPLY NEED TO HAVE ATTENDED THESE TREATMENT CLASSES AND PARTICIPATED- BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER ADDICTED. BECAUSE MOST INDIVIDUALS WILL STRUGGLE WITH THIS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND THAT'S PARTLY WHY BUILD LIKE A B. SEVENTEEN FIFTY OR SO PORTANT. BECAUSE AT LEAST THE TEACHER THEM TO MANAGE THEIR ADDICTION WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THEIR LIVES. THEY YOU FOR THAT CLEAR FOR. ON THE BILL. THAT RANIERE COMMENTS OR- YES START WEBER. GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND FOR I'M BRINGING FORTH THIS BILL I THINK ALL OF US ARE VERY WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUES WITH DRUGS THE ISSUES WITH FENNEL- YOU KNOW IN SAN DIEGO WE'RE DOING SOME GOOD THINGS BUT IT'S NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA THING AS WAS STATED EARLIER WITH THE SITUATION THAT JUST HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND IN FLORIDA- I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THE OPPOSITION TO- AT THIS BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD IF IT DOES MOVE FORWARD. AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE POINTED OUT THAT ADDICTION IS A IT'S A MEDICAL ISSUE IT IS A CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUE BUT I ALSO WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE. THAT WITH ALL MEDICAL ISSUES ESPECIALLY CHRONIC MEDICAL ONCE ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS TO THAT IS EDUCATION. SO IF YOU HAVE DIABETES WE SENT YOU TO ABOUT DIABETIC COUNSELOR SO THAT YOU LEARN HOW TO WHAT YOU SHOULD EAT HOW YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR MEDICATIONS- WHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS IF YOUR IF YOUR GLUCOSE IS TOO LOW- AND SO THIS IS JUST LIKE THAT. YOU HAVE A AN ADDICTION WE'RE SENDING YOU TO SOME PEOPLE THAT CAN EDUCATE YOU. ON ON HOW TO HELP OVERCOME THAT POINT BECAUSE IT IS A LIFELONG THING AND SO. YOU KNOW I THINK FOR A VERY LONG TIME THAT IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN LACKING WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE- ADDICTION TO DRUGS AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- AND I CAN'T I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IF IT GETS ON THE FLOOR. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE OPPOSITION TO HOPEFULLY REMOVE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NICE THANK YOU- AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND- IN FACT A WITH THE MILITARY- IN.

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I RISE RISEN AB SIX SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THE ALTERNATIVE CONSERVATION COMMISSION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR STATE HAS. ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. WE SPEND OVER FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR JUST ON OUR STATE CORRECTIONS EXPENDITURES. WE'VE USED INCARCERATION FOR THE FIRST AND LAST CHOICE TO SOLVE MANY OF OUR SOCIAL PROBLEMS. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY OVER A DECADE OF THOUGHTFUL OVER ORGANIZATION LED TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. PUSHING THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION WORKGROUP. ROOTED IN A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH. TO RE EVALUATING OUR CONTINUUM OF CARE. I AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS TO INCARCERATION THAT STRATEGY RESULTED IN A REPORT THAT HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS ONE OF THEM TO ESTABLISH THE ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION OFFICE IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. IN THE CEOS OFFICE. THAT OFFICE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. AND A NUMBER OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT REPORT. HIGHLIGHTED SOME THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMITATIONS BETWEEN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RATHER THAN RUNNING THOSE. INCONSISTENCIES INTO LEGISLATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AT THE STATE FIRST STOP AND GATHER MORE EVIDENCE AND DATA AND ELEVATE THOSE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY OUR SYSTEMS OF INCARCERATION BY DEVELOPING THE SAME KIND OF COMMISSION THAT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. HAS DEVELOPED. THE COMMISSION WAS COLLABORATIVE INCLUDED STATE ENTITIES THIS COMMISSION WOULD BE THE SAME- AND ROOTED IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THEY WOULD LAST FOR ONE YEAR WOULD HAVE APPOINTEES FROM BOTH HOUSES- AND APPOINTEES FROM THE GOVERNOR. IT WOULD ALSO AGAIN UP LIFT ASSIST SYSTEM ACTORS WHO HAVE A ROLL AND ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION AND THOSE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM JOINING ME TODAY.

TO ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND WE'VE GOT DEDICATED SEATS FOR THOSE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE HAVING BEEN IMPACTED BY THE FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND SO I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE'S LIKELY TO BE OVERLAP. BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE. WHO ACCORDING TO WHAT I'VE READ. THERE'S ELEVEN. MEMBERSHIP SLOTS. ANOTHER ONE OF ON- REPRESENT A CRIME VICTIM. ORGANIZATION SO I FEEL LIKE- BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COLLABORATIVE I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE TO INCLUDE CRIME VICTIMS AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE DOING THAT SO I'LL HAVE TO OPPOSE IT.

OR PERSON EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS STEALING A BAG OF POTATO CHIPS IT IS ON A SCALE THAT ENDANGERS THE SAFETY OF RETAIL WORKERS THE SAFETY OF CUSTOMERS TRYING TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES TRYING TO MAKE PAY ROLL WHEN I ASKED MY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT WE COULD DO I WAS SURPRISED BY THEIR SIMPLE REQUEST BRING BACK A TOOL THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR TWICE BUT WAS ALLOWED TO SUNSET LAST SUMMER. THE CONTENT OF THIS BILL HAS INTRODUCED WAS VERBATIM THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL CHARGING TOOL THAT WAS PACKAGED IN AB TEN SIXTY FIVE ALONG WITH THE CREATION OF THE CRIME OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IN THE CHP TASK FORCE THE CHAIRS TIMELY RESPONSE TO A SURGE OF THESE OFFENSES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE OVERWHELMING OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED THAT BILL AND FOLLOW UP BUDGET BILL IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT EXTENDED THE SUNSET DATE THE BILL BEFORE YOU HEAR DIFFERENCE ONLY SLIGHTLY AND I NEGOTIATED WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND TOOK THEIR AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE THE PERMISSION OF THE PROSECUTING AGENCY WITH THE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION FOR ANY ASSOCIATED OFFENSE. OTHER THAN THE ENUMERATED THEFT OFFENSES I'M HAPPY TO NOTE THEY HAVE REMOVED THEIR OFFICE ADDITION TO THE BILL. LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES OF THE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS BEING DISCUSSED AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. THE GOVERNOR'S REAL PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN PROPOSES WE INVEST THIRTY MILLION IN OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES AND EIGHTEEN MILLION IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO COME COMBAT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. WITHOUT AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA WILL BE REQUIRED TO WASTE TAXPAYER DOLLARS SENDING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TO MULTIPLE. COUNTIES TO PROSECUTE TO PERMIT SECURED THE SAME THAT THEFT RING AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WILL BE SCHEDULING THE THIRD OR FOURTH SEQUENTIAL TRIAL TO PROSECUTE THE SAME DEFENDANT FOR STEALING SIMILAR MERCHANDISE. ALL OF WASTE OF TAXPAYER FUNDS. TODAY I HAVE JOINING WITH ME. THE TWO SPONSORS OF THE BILL HOPEFULLY BOTH OF THEM WILL BE JOINING A VETERAN COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY ERIC NESTERENKO. AND BY PHONE VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF BILL A YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIC NESTERENKO PLEASE TO BE BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING AND RECOGNIZING. ASSEMBLYWOMAN JACQUI IRWIN FOR INTRODUCING ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN THIRTEEN. AND I WANT TO ASK ALL OF YOU TO BRING BACK A BILL THAT WORKED AND THAT THE OFFICE OF THE VENTURA COUNTY DA RELIED UPON SPECIFICALLY WHEN THE LAPSED STATUTE PENAL CODE SECTION SEVEN EIGHT SIX POINT FIVE WAS IN EFFECT. OUR OFFICE USED IT IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT CASES AGAINST TWELVE DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS ONE UNDERSCORE UNDERLINED SOMETHING THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST SPOKE UP THESE ARE ORGANIZED SOPHISTICATED RETAIL THEFT CREWS AND RINGS. THEY ARE NOT USEFUL IMPETUOUS AXE THEY ARE NOT SPUR OF THE MOMENT CRIMES. NOR ARE THEY CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT TRAVEL OUR VAST NETWORK OF FREEWAYS WHETHER THE FIVE EIGHTY OR THE SIXTY OR THE ONE THE ONE OF THE FOUR OH FIVE FOR THE FOURTEENTH. AND THEY TARGET SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES AND SPECIFIC STORES WHY DO THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY USE A SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL NETWORK TO UNDERSTAND THE STORE LAYOUT. TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE LOSS PREVENTION OFFICERS ARE SITUATED WITH THE SECURITY GUARDS MAYBE AND ALSO MOST IMPORTANTLY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MERCHANDISE IS STORED AND WHAT IT IS VALUED ACT. THESE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED ORGANIZED RINGS THE RELY UPON THE CELLPHONE. AND IN DOING SO THE CHIEF COORDINATION COMMUNICATION IMPORTANT TO THE OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY BOTH HERE AND STATEWIDE IS THAT THESE CASES RECEIVE A QUARTERBACK THAT IS ONE OFFICE WHICH CAN TAKE ALL OF THE STAFFS AND CONSOLIDATE THEM INTO ONE PROSECUTION WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WOULD RELY UPON THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK WHICH IS FRAGMENTARY IN NATURE DISCIPLINE TO THESE CASES ACROSS COUNTIES MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS ESSENTIALLY WHO SPENDS RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT'S NOT WISE FOR TAXPAYERS IT ALSO HURTS VICTIMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TESTIFY CONCEIVABLY IN MULTIPLE COURT ROOMS AND MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. IN THE BILL THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN OR IS COUNTRY IN TERMS BRINGS BACK A FRAMEWORK THAT AVOIDS REPETITION AND PIECEMEAL PROSECUTION. AND THEN LASTLY I JUST WANT TO SHARE- A COMMENT IN RESPECT TO THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS BOUGHT FORD IN THE BILL SPECIFICALLY THE COMMENT WAS. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE PRESCRIBE LOOSER JURISDICTIONAL RULES FOR THEFT OFFENSES THAN IT DOES FOR FELONY SEX OFFENSES AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING OFFENSES IT'S A POINT WORTH DISCUSSING VERY BRIEFLY NOW. THE NATURE OF THE PUNISHMENT FOR FELONY SEX OFFENSES AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING OFFENSES IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT THE REASON THE GUARDRAILS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE SEX AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES THAN THEY ARE IN O. R. T. CASES. IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SEX CRIMES ARE PUNISHABLE BY THE POTENTIAL FOR LIFETIME SIX REGISTRATION. BY IMPRISONMENT IN CDC ARE- AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE SEX OFFENSES ARE STRIKES SO THE GUARDRAILS FOR THOSE TYPES OF CRIMES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE O. R. T. ONES BECAUSE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT FOR NINETY POINT FOUR. FOUR NINETY SIX- CONSPIRACY FORTY SEVEN GRAND THEFT THERE PUNISHABLE BY FELONY JAIL WHICH ESSENTIALLY MEANS THEIR COMMITMENTS IN THE LOCAL- JAIL THEY ARE PUNISHABLE UNDER ELEVEN SEVENTY H. AND MANY OF THEM ALSO ARE WHILE BLURS SO THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN NATURE FROM THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE SEX CRIMES. THAT ALLOW FOR CROSS JURISDICTIONAL FILING IN PENAL CODE SECTION SEVEN EIGHT FOUR POINT SEVEN- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL. IT IS TIMELY IT IS NEEDED AND IT WILL HELP DISMANTLE SOPHISTICATED VERY COORDINATED CREWS WHO USE OUR VAST NETWORK OF FREEWAYS TO STEAL FOR MERCHANTS WHO STEAL FROM BUSINESSES AND YOU UP ROUTE AND ENDANGER OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE ROOM AT IN SUPPORT.

BIG NOTE HERE FROM WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO ENOUGH OF OUR SECOND WITNESS WAS TRYING TO GET ON THE LINE OKAY EIGHTEEN OPERATOR I BELIEVE THE SECOND WITNESS. I WAS TRYING TO GET THROUGH CAN YOU BRING THEM ON RIGHT NOW. AT THE END IT WOULD BE DISPLAYED AEROFIT. SHERIFF A GOOD MORNING SHARE BILLY YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. A GOOD MORNING JERRY JONES SAWYER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ABILITY YOU VENTURA COUNTY. YOU HEARD MUCH SAID ALREADY ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE'VE ALL SEEN IMAGES OF GROUPS OF CRIMINALS ENTERING OPEN BUSINESSES REMOVING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE- MANY CASES WHILE NOT BEING CONFRONTED BY STORE EMPLOYEES OR SECURITY GUARDS. YOU ADD TO THAT THE FLASH MOB STYLE TAKEOVERS OF BUSINESSES AND SMASH AND GRAB THEFTS AND WE'RE ALL LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT CRIME IS SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL IN OUR GREAT STATE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO THINK RETAIL COMPANIES CAN SIMPLY ABSORB THESE LOSSES AND IT THERE ARE NO REAL VICTIMS OF THESE RETAIL CRIMES AND THE REALITY IS THAT WE ARE ALL VICTIMS OF THESE BRAZEN ACTS. RETAIL RETAILERS SIMPLY DO NOT ABSORB THE COST OF THEFT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RAISE PRICES TO COMPENSATE FOR THEIR LOSSES CAUSED BY THESE CRIMINAL ACTS. WE ALL PAY A PRICE IN A DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS THOSE AMONG US. WHO CAN AFFORD AT LEAST. IN COUNTY AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE PEOPLE WHO TARGET OUR COMMUNITIES WITH THESE TYPES OF CRIMES. TWO OF THE LARGEST RETAIL CENTERS IN VENTURA COUNTY. ORANGE CITY POLICE BY THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT BEEN IMMUNE TO THISLAWLESS BEHAVIOR. BUT WE FOUND THAT VERY LITTLE OF IT IS COMMITTED BY LOCAL CRIMINALS. MOST OF THE HIGHLY MOBILE CREWS ORIGINATE IN THE STATE'S LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS. IN FACT. OF THE EIGHTY SIX ARRESTS WE MADE CORGAN EYES RETAIL THEFT THIS PAST YEAR. NEARLY 75% OF THE OFFENDERS TRAVELLED INTO VENTURA COUNTY FROM OTHER PLACES. TO COMMIT THOSE CRIMES. THESE ARE ORGANIZED THIEVES NOT DRUG DEPENDENT VICTIMS OR OTHERS. LOOKING TO SUSTAIN. A LIFESTYLE THAT NEWS. YOU WILL BY DRUG OF DEPENDENCE AND- USE. OTHER GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE CRIMES BREEZE TRAVEL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. TARGETING RETAIL CENTERS AND MANAGER DIFFERENT JURISDICTION. INCLUDING OUR OWN. AND FOR THIS REASON IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE THE TOOLS. TO CONSOLIDATE CASES FOR MULTIPLE COUNTIES. SO THEY CAN PROPERLY. PROSECUTE CRIMINALS FOR THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT. RECENTLY OUR ARE SO CREW TO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MULTIPLE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT ACROSS CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE TRY TO CONSOLIDATE THOSE CASES ONLY TO LEARN THAT THE LAW CHAPTER INTOPEOPLE CO SEVEN EIGHTY SIX POINT FIVE. WHICH PREVIOUSLY ALLOWED PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE SUSPECTS WITH MULTIPLE CASES ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES THAT EXPIRED LAST YEAR. OUR DEBT THESE WERE TIRELESSLY ALONGSIDE PROSECUTORS TO BRING THOSE OFFENDERS TO JUSTICE MAKING ARRESTS ONLY TO HAVE SUSPECTS QUICKLY RELEASED FROM JAIL AND NOT CHARGE. FOR ONLY CHARGED WITH A FRACTION OF THEIR ACTUAL CRIMES HURTS PUBLIC SAFETY IN IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC WE ALL SERVE. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WANTS BILL AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN. TO REINSTATE THE LAW THAT GIVES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S THE TOOLS TO CONSOLIDATE CASES FROM MULTIPLE COUNTIES. TO PROPERLY PROSECUTE CRIMINALS FOR THE CRIME THEY COMMIT. IT IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. AND IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO ADDRESS THE INCREASINGLY BRAZEN INCIDENTS OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WE'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. NOW HEAR FROM WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IN A ROW MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS FRED WHIMS ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION IN OPPOSITION FIRST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING ON A MINUTES ON THIS BILL. THE FORTY AT THIS TIME WE MUST TO REMAIN OPPOSED. AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN UNDER EXISTING- WOULD ALLOW PROSECUTOR WITH ALMOST NO CONNECTION TO AN ALLEGED OFFENSE TO PROSECUTE SUCH ALLEGED OFFENSE. THIS BILL RENDON A BROAD MANNER LIKE PROSECUTORS IN THE COUNTY WERE ANY ACT WAS DONE BY THE DEFENDANT INSTIGATING PROCURING PROMOTING OR AIDING. IN THE COMMISSION OF THE THEFT OFFENSE THE TEXT THIS BILL COULD CREATE A SITUATION WHERE A PROSECUTOR WITH THE LEASING NEXUS TO THE OFFENSE. COULD BECOME THE PRINCIPAL PART PROSECUTING COUNTY REGISTER CONTAINS OFFICE. UNDER EXISTING LAW PROSECUTOR HAD THE JURISDICTION OVER ANY ALLEGED OFFENCE OCCURRING THERE COUNTY GIVING LOCAL PROSECUTOR THE FINAL SAY OVER CHARGING DECISION MAKES IT. BOTH BECAUSE THE PROSECUTOR CAN CONSISTENTLY DETERMINE WHAT CHARGES IF ANY ARE APPROPRIATE. AND BECAUSE FORCING VICTIMS WHEN THE SYSTEM IN ITS TO TRAVEL OUT OF COUNTY CAN BE DISRUPTIVE FORM PRACTICAL. INCLUDING DURING THEIR APPOINTMENT ABILITY CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. LASTLY THIS BILL REINSTATES A MECHANISM JURY IDEATION OPTING. WILL PROSECUTE DECISIONS ARE MADE BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST FAVORABLE JERRY OR THE MOST RESOURCE DA OFFICE. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NOTEBOOK ON THIS BILL THANK. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES- EITHER IN THE ROOM OR OUTSIDE. THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION OPERATOR YOU MAY OPEN UP THE LINE. IRWIN AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE AND THEN ZERO FOR IN OPPOSITION AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN. AND WE WILL GO TO LIE NINETY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MY NINETY ONE. AND WE WILL GO ON TO LINE EIGHTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MORNING TURN MEMBERS GREGORY FELLOW BEHALF OF INITIATE JUSTICE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE SOMEONE JUST STEPPED IN THE ROOM- IN OPPOSITION NAME AN ORGANIZATION THE MORNING DAN AYKROYD ON ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. OR. WHICH TO. OKAY I'M HONORED TO GO FIRST I GUESS IS THE NUBIA I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE NEED TO SO WE CAN START WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR D. X. THEY RUN FROM ONE COUNTY TO THE OTHER COUNTY IN THE CAN COLLECTIVELY WORK TOGETHER I'LL BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. MR LACKEY YEAH- AS WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION- THIS WAS THIS IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESTORING PROVISIONS OF LAW AND LOGIC SUNSET TO ALLOW US TO REASSESS WHETHER THERE ARE COMPELLING CIRCUMSTANCES TO REINSTATE THAT PARTICULAR LAW WHO IN THE WORLD DOES NOT THINK THAT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT DOESN'T NEED HELP RIGHT NOW. I MEAN THAT'S A COMPLETE APPLICATION OF REALITY- IT IT'S A GROWING PROBLEM NOT A DIMINISHING ONE AND THIS IS A COMMONSENSE PROVISION THAT DESERVES TO BE REINSTATED NAVI. CLEARLY SUPPORTING THANK YOU BONTA CAN YOU HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISED AROUND A FORUM FORUM SHOPPING AND THEN ALSO JUST IN THE INTEREST OF MAKING SURE THAT DEFENDANTS HAVE AT THE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HAVE THEIR CASES REVIEWED BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR US TO HAVE TO. TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION IN YOUR LEGISLATION THE OTHER OUT I WILL HAVE YOU FOLLOW UP ON THAT THE LAWYER ACTUALLY BUT- THEY MEANT TO THE OPPOSITION MENTIONS THAT. YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE PROSECUTORS WITH ALMOST NO CONNECTION OR- TO THE DEFENDANTS BUT- THE LANGUAGE OF SIXTEEN THIRTEEN SAYS THE OFFENSES HAVE TO OCCUR LOCALLY WITH SUBSTANTIAL CONNECTION OF THE SAME DEFENDANTS ARE THE SAME SCHEME OR MERCHANDISE FOR A PROSECUTOR TO FILE CHARGES. SO THE CRIME DID OCCUR. IN THE COUNTY AND- AND IT'S JUSTA MATTER OF COMPILING ALL THAT IT YOU KNOW IF IT'S IF IT'S CROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES COMPILING ALL THOSE- ALL THE DIFFERENT OFFENSES. AND THERE IS ACTUALLY NO- THERE THERE IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL- RIGHT TO. THE END OF THAT THAT THE ACLU IS TIME NOT JURY SHOPPING THERE'S NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVING A TRIAL WHERE YOU WANT ITS WORD. THE CRIME ACTUALLY OCCURRED SELF I'M SURE YOU WOULD. HAVE A BETTER FOLLOW UP NEXT. YEAH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- ASSEMBLY ONE. WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN SHOP AND I WOULD ASSERT THAT. DA'S ARE GOING TO BRING FORWARD THE CASE THAT AROSE FROM THEIR JURISDICTIONS WE'RE GONNA WANT TO BRING FOR IT A ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT THAT HAPPENED IN THE COUNTY OF VENTURA- THERE HAS TO BE AS WE ALL KNOW SOME NEXUS SOME CALLS A LINK TO OUR COUNTY- I THINK IN A VERY EXCEEDINGLY RARE CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD IT SIMPLY BE THE MERCHANDISE- WE WOULD WANT TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN- O. R. T. IN OUR COUNTY- THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT. AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE OTHER COUNTIES AND- OFFENSES THAT HAPPENED THERE- SERIOUSLY AND RECOGNIZE BOTH DEFENDANTS AND VICTIMS. I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU THAT. IN OUR WORLD. OUR CASELOADS ARE OVERWHELMING. SO IN THE CASE OF THE SHERIFF MENTIONED- THERE WAS A TWO PERSON CREW THAT WENT INTO A NUMBER OF BEAUTY SUPPLY STORES. BASED TOLD ALL TOTAL THIRTY NINE THOUSAND AND HIGH END PERFUMES AND BEATY SUPPLY ITEMS. AND WE LEARN THAT ONE MEMBER OF THE CREW WAS BEING INVESTIGATED AND FOR OTHER COUNTIES SAMBAR TO DINO RIVERSIDE LA IN SAN DIEGO FOR ALLEGE LOSSES UP TO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WHAT ARE OFFICE WOULD DO SENSE. SUPPORTERS AND ALL THIS MADERA COUNTY WERE VICTIMS OF A R. T. WE WOULD CONTACT THOSE OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH SAY WE HAD THE CRIME HAPPENED HERE CAN WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR CASES AND PUT THEM INTO A SINGLE PROSECUTION. I BELIEVE THEY WOULD WELCOME THAT BECAUSE ONE THEY WANT SOMEBODY TO BE THAT QUARTERBACK SOMEBODY NEEDS TO STEP FORWARD AND SAY THIS IS A REIGNING IT'S SOPHISTICATED IN ORDER TO DISMANTLE IT WE NEED TO BE EQUALLY COORDINATED AND IN SYNC. AND WITH RESPECT TO- LASTLY UST TO ADDRESS YOUR COMMENT AND QUESTION. YOU KNOW THE JURY WOULD BE ONE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A JURY OF PEERS- IT WOULD BE SELECTED THROUGH THE SAFEGUARDS THERE NOW IN PLACE TO THIRTY SEVENTY ANOTHER LOSS. AND I BELIEVE THAT DEFENDANTS WHEREVER THEY ARISE WHEN THEY COME INTO COUNTIES AND- ARE BROUGHT FORWARD ON THESE CASES. THEY WILL RECEIVE FAIR AND PUBLIC JURY TRIALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNED. WITH WEBER HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT- THE LANGUAGE SO WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WHICH I COMPLETELY GET- IT SAYS THIS BILL WOULD ADDITIONALLY ESTABLISH THE JURISDICTION OF A CRIMINAL ACTION FOR THEFT. ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT OR RECEIPT OF STOLEN PROPERTY NEVADA SO IT. HOW DO IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY ONLY ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT SO WHY ARE WE FOCUSING JUST ON ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT STATES HEARING ABOUT. THE BILL IS AIMED AT ADDRESSING- THE SAME DEFENDANTS. THE SAME TYPE OF MERCHANDISE AND THE THEFT OF WHICH IS DONE ACCORDING TO A COMMON PLAN OR SCHEME. HENCE THE SOPHISTICATION HENCE THE ORGANIZED NATURE OF THE CRIME SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIMILAR PATTERNS OF CONDUCT ACROSS COUNTIES ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES. THAT'S WHY WE CALL IT A WAR T. NOW. THERE'S LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADDED ABOUT WHAT WE CALL THE ATTENDANT- PEACE IS A CRIME THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE FOR EXAMPLE PERHAPS A CONSPIRACY CHARGE IT MAY BE A GRAND THEFT FORTY SEVEN ABOVE THE VALUE OF NINE FIFTY THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE PERMISSION OF THE ENTITY FROM WHICH WE ARE TAKING HE CASE- VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S IN LAW AT SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR POINT SEVEN OF THE PENAL CODE. SO THERE IS A SAFEGUARD IF WE GO BEYOND SIMPLY THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WE HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THAT OTHER JURISDICTION AND SAY. MISTER OR MISS DA DO WE HAVE YOUR AUTHORITY TO TAKE THAT CASE BECAUSE IT FALLS OUTSIDE THE STRICT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL RIGHT NOW SO IT'S A GOOD PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS- WITH IT BEING MORE PRIDE THAT YOU CAN PULL IN PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY A PART OF THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AND I'M HOPING THAT THERE'S SOME LEGAL DEFINITION OF IT SOMEWHERE. WHAT EXACTLY ENTAILS ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT LIKE A CERTAIN NUMBER AND YOU KNOW PROOF THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN TOGETHER AND IT'S NOT JUST. SOMEONE WHO HAPPENED TO GO IN AND- STILL SOMETHING UNFORTUNATE FROM A RETAILER. HE HAD THE BEST GUIDE TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN WEBER WOULD BE LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE OF FOUR NINETY POINT FOUR- YOU KNOW. INDIVIDUALS ACTING IN CONCERT THAT'S IMPORTANT HAS TO BE SOME COORDINATION SOME PLANNING BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM- THERE HAS TO BE USUALLY SIMILAR MERCHANDISE THAT'S TAKEN. COMMON PLANS OR SCHEMES THAT IS THEY'RE USING THE SAME MODUS OPERANDI HI. IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN DIFFERENT STORES BUT THE SAME AMMO IS EMPLOYED. HMM AND ALSO THE SAME DEFENSE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE BASICALLY EXAMINING THE SAME CONDUCT COMMITTED BY THE SAME PEOPLE IT JUST HAPPENS TO GO ACROSS COUNTY LINES. AND HAPPEN IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW WAS CALIFORNIANS THERE'S A VAST FREEWAY NETWORK SO IF THEY WANT TO TARGET HOME DEPOTS THEY'RE GONNA GO TO MULTIPLE HOME DEPOTS IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES. WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS SO URGENT NEED SO THIS BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY TO. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED TO HAVE DONE THIS MULTIPLE TIMES NOT JUST ONE TIME. SURE YEAH I MEAN THIS IS. THIS IS GOING AFTER A SERIAL ISSUE IT'S NOT A ONE TIME ACT IT'S HAPPENING IN OTHER COUNTIES NOT ONLY BEEN TURRETS WHAT THIS DOES FOR JUDICIAL ECONOMY AND TO PRESERVE SCARCE JUDICIAL RESOURCES. IS BRING THAT CASE INTO OUR COUNTY THAT AROSE AND SAMPOERNA DINO RIVERSIDE OR ELSEWHERE OR SAN DIEGO COUNTY. BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT PROSECUTIONS IN FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND I ALSO WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU IF YOU'RE THE DEFENDANT. THEN YOU TOO COULD BE PROSECUTED SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND THEN YOU MAY BE IN CUSTODY OR CONVICTED THEN THERE'S AN ORDER FOR PRODUCTION FOR YOU TO APPEAR NOW IN LA COUNTY. SO YOU KNOW THIS GOES BOTH WAYS. OKAY MISTER BRYANT. I'LL BE QUICK UP STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL ACCENT OF THE AT THE AUTHOR'S INTENTIONS- WHAT'S TO PREVENT- DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM FROM STACKING CHARGES THAT OTHER DA'S WOULDN'T HAVE FILED BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE AND THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY. WE DON'T STACK- BECAUSE- THAT MAY BE THE WRONG LANGUAGE WILL LET'S SAY THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS WITH SAN DIEGO COUNTY. DOESN'T FEEL THAT IN A RISE TO THE LEVEL OF FILED A CASE WITH VENTURA WOULD LIKE TO ADD WHAT HAPPENED SAN DIEGO TO ITS CASE. WHAT'S TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING IRRESPECTIVE OF THE DA'S DISCRETION IN THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. YOU KNOW IT'S SAN DIEGO DECIDED TO TAKE A PASS ON IT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT OUR OFFICE WOULD CONSIDER IT WOULD BE PROBATIVE AND RELEVANT IN OUR EXAMINATION PREVENT YOU FROM ADDING. NO AGREE TO SOME A NUMBER BUT YOU KNOW WE FREQUENTLY SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER WE'RE ALL COLLEAGUES IN THIS PROFESSION SO WE WOULD. SPEAK TO THE DA IN THAT COUNTY AND SAY. WHY DID YOU NOT FILE WHAT WAS THE INFIRMITY OF THIS CASE WAS THERE SOME ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF AND WERE FREQUENTLY IN CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. SO ONE OF THE GUARD RAILS WERE THE PRECAUTION SOME PLACES. YOU KNOW IF ANOTHER ENTITY HAS PASSED ON IT WE WANT TO KNOW WHY AND THAT WOULD BE PROBATIVE AND RELEVANT OUR ANALYSIS WHETHER OR NOT WE PERCEIVE. THANK BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS ARE CONCERNED. SHE GAVE ME YOU MAY CLOSE. OF CLOSING I SIMPLY WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN IS SIMPLY PROVIDING A TOOL FOR PROSECUTORS TO BRING JUSTICE- THAT TO BRING JUSTICE TO THEFT RINGS WHO DESIGNED THEIR SCHEMES TO CROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES. AND USE THE LIMITS OF PROSECUTORS AGAINST THEM EVADING EVEN BEING CHARGED WITH THEIR CRIMES WHILE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SPEAKS MAKING A TRIAL CONVENIENT FOR DEFENDANTS- AS DEPUTY DA NAS RECORD MENTIONED. I WOULD PREFER THAT SAID THIS LEGISLATURE ACT TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY COMBAT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IN CALIFORNIA THE SAME WAY THAT IT DID IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. THANK YOU ON. AND I GUESS FOR PEOPLE ARE LISTENING AND- JUSTIN AND JUSTIN MAKING SURE IN FULL DISCLOSURE. WHEN YOU SAY FORTY. FOUR NINETY POINT FOUR. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MY BILL YES WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE AUTHOR CORRECT OF THE BILL. DEFINITELY KNOWS THE INTENT THE PURPOSE. I ACTUALLY WROTE. BUT I'M ALSO THE ONE THAT TOOK OUT WHICH YOU WANT TO PUT BACK IN. FOR VERY GOOD REASON. AGAIN. THE PERSON THAT DID THIS AND WHEN I DID THIS BILL. FOR ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. I REMEMBER LAW ENFORCEMENT DA'S INCLUDE SAID IT WOULDN'T WORK WE SHOULDN'T DO IT YOU'RE A GUEST. UNBELIEVABLY AGAINST IT AND IT TOOK A LOT OF ARM TWISTING PART OF THAT NEGOTIATION WITH ADDING IN THIS PROVISION SO IT LEASE GET IT STARTED SIR WE GET C. H. P. TOGETHER TO START AGGREGATING AND WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT CROSS JURISDICTIONS. WOULD BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE. OVER THOSE YEARS- LAW ENFORCEMENT IN REALLY PARTICIPATE- HELP C. H. P. IN THIS EFFORT- I DON'T KNOW IF BECAUSE- DO YOU WANT TO DO IT THEIR WAY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT DOES WHAT YOU WANT TO. DO MUCH TO. MY SURPRISE OVER THE SUMMER. WHEN WE- AFTER WE DECIDED TO. EXTEND ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT PUTIN ANOTHER FIVE MILLION TO KEEP C. H. P. ON TOP OF IT. THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO THIS EFFORT BECAUSE COULD HAVE YOUR SAY. THIS IS A THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE REALLY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IT SOMETHING I WANTED TO DO. YEARS BEFORE. WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON RIGHT NOW- AND IN FACT I THINK. AND I MAY BE WRONG AND STAFF PROBABLY CAN CHECK. MY BILL MAY BE THE ONLY NEW FELONY DOES COME TO THIS COMMITTEE SINCE I'VE BEEN ON HERE. SO THAT ALSO TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO THIS COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE GO AFTER WOULD YOU CALL THE REAL CRIMINALS THE MASTERMIND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. ARE PULLING ALL THIS TOGETHER. SO NOT ONLY DID WE CREATE A LAW. NOT ONLY DO WE FIX THE LAW NO NEED WE PUT FIVE MILLION INTO IT NOT ONLY DO WE PUT ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED MILLION. WE'RE NOW TRYING TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. WHICH JUST STARTED TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. TAKE THOSE CASES IN TODAY AGGREGATE SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH IT. WHAT WHAT I'M GOING TO OFFER. BECAUSE I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE NOT WORKING IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY. DA'S WHEN THEY DO THEIR OWN THING POLICE DEPARTMENT DO THEIR WAY- I HAVE MUCH. THE CHP DOING SOMETHING AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO ASK D. A. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE WE ALL. M. BECAUSE WORKING IN SILOS. WOULD PROBABLY GONNA GET THE SAME RESULT THAT WE GET AS A WORK IN SILOS ON THE HOMELESS PROBLEM WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES WE HAVE IN THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE ALL OF THAT BUT WE CAN'T GET IT DONE. YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WORKING IN A COLLABORATIVE. EFFORT WHAT I WOULD OFFER IS- SHOULD THIS BILL. NOT MAKE IT THAT WE DON'T LET IT DIE HERE. THAT WE ACTUALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME. BRING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL POLICE AND HAVE FIVE TO CONVENE LIKE US IN A ROOM WE ALL COME TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH ONE PLAN. LIKE YOU SAID WITH ONE INDIVIDUAL IN CHARGE YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL THESE MULTIPLE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE REASON WHY TO SEIZE P. WORKS BECAUSE CHP IS DOING IT BY THEMSELVES AND THEY'RE GETTING IT DONE LOOK AT THEIR ARREST RECORD LOOK AT THEIR SUCCESS RECORD IT'S UNBELIEVABLE IS OFF THE CHARTS BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE KIND OF. THEY'RE NOT GETTING. THE CREDIT THAT THEY NEED THEY DID DESERVE TO SHOW THAT. AND AGAIN IN FULL DISCLOSURE IT IS MY BILL THAT THE ORGANIZED RETAILS THE BILL DOES WORK. I'LL SAY IT AGAIN THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT BILL MY BILL DOES WORK- AND SO I I'M SAYING WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER. AND BRING IT ALL BACK IN TOGETHER SO THAT- IF IT DOESN'T PASS YOU ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION. AND IN THAT RECONSIDERATION WE COME BACK AGAIN WE CAN WORK ON OUR ULTIMATE SOLUTION. THAT WILL GET RID OF THE SCOURGE. IN A IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND THAT WE ATTACK IT TOGETHER. NOT A PART BECAUSE THE OTHER PART OF THAT WHICH IS THE OPPOSITION CONCERNED ABOUT. STACKING AND YOU KNOW YOU COULD ASK RODNEY KING ABOUT BEING. GOING TO SEAMY VALLEY. THEY HAVE JUSTICE BEING DONE IT IN QUITE WORK FOR HIM. SO THAT IS THE ULTIMATE CONCERN IS A CONCERN THAT THIS COULD BE USED AGAINST. PROGRESSIVE D. A.'S BUT YOU DON'T DO YOUR JOB WE'RE GOING TO RUN IT FOR YOU YES THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE CAN'T WE HAVE STOPPED DOING THIS WE JUST GOT WE JUST GOT TO STOP BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT SUFFER. ARE NOT ONLY RETAILERS BUT THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AND SO- I'M I'M OFFERING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN- ONCE AND FOR ALL. AND SO THAT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM. AS PARTNERS IN. SO WE CAN ULTIMATELY- HAVE A COORDINATED ATTACKAGAINST ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT SO WE CAN ELIMINATED IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST AND BE THE LEADERS AND ELIMINATED GOING FORWARD AND FORTUNATELY I.

THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE CIVILLY COMMITTED TO A STATE HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT SOME SB PIECE QUALIFY FOR CONDITIONAL RELEASE INTO THE COMMUNITY WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO RAISE RECEIVE TREATMENT UNDER THEIR CIVIL COMMITMENT. IS EXISTING PRACTICES STATE ITS CONTRACTORS TO USE TWENTY FOUR HOUR GPS MONITORING HOWEVER THERE ISNO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS BE GPS MONITORED AB SIXTEEN FORTY ONE CODIFIES THIS REGIONAL MEASURE TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY THANK AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. SHARE OF THE BILL. SECOND. ARE ANY WITNESSES IN A ROOM IN SUPPORT. IN THE ROOM OR OUTSIDE THE ROOM. KAMALA TOMORROW IN. SOCIALIST. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NOW WILL GO TO AT&amp;T LINE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN FORTY ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE TO TEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW HERE FOR WITNESSES IN A ROOM IN OPPOSITION I THINK I HAVE KATHY SURE TESTIFYING IN PERSON. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION- WE RESPECTFULLY MUST PROPOSED EIGHTY SIXTEEN FORTY ONE- I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE BILL AND HIS RESPONSIVENESS TO CONCERNS THATHAVE BEEN RAISED- THAT SAID. WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO WHAT IS LEFT IN THE BILL A REQUIREMENT THAT-EVERY INDIVIDUAL PLACED ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE UNDER THE S. V. P. LAW BE SUBJECT TO GPS MONITORING FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD THEY REMAIN ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE. A PERSON COMMITTED FOR TREATMENT UNDER THE S. B. P. LA MUST GO THROUGH A GREAT DEAL TO BE ABLE TO BE RELEASED ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE. THEY'VE ALREADY COMPLETED A PRISON SENTENCE THEN THEY HAVE SPENT YEARS UNDERGOING TREATMENT WHILE CONFINED AT THE COALINGA STATE HOSPITAL. THE PERSON MUST BE FOUND BY A COURT NO LONGER TO POSE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE THEY CAN BE RELEASED. AND EVEN THEN IS SUBJECT TO STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS AS TO WHERE THEY CAN LIVE. AND REMAINS UNDER TREATMENT AND SUPERVISION FOR THE PERIOD OF CONDITIONAL RELEASE WHICH DOES NOT END UNTIL THE COURT FINDS THAT THE PERSON CAN SAFELY BE UNCONDITIONALLY DISCHARGED. EXISTING LAW ALREADY PROVIDES THAT ALL PERSONS ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEY WILL BE SUPERVISED. THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES FOR EVERY PERSON ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE AND FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF CONDITIONAL RELEASE. THAT THEY BE SUBJECT TO GPS MONITORING. ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE CURRENT PRACTICE IT IS NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED BY STATUTE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE. DIFFERENT PEOPLE PRESENT DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND HAVE DIFFERENT SUPERVISION NEEDS. GPS IS NOT NECESSARY FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL OR BENEFICIAL TO THEIR TREATMENT. IMPOSING IT ON TO IT FOR EVERYONE ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE LOCKS IN A PRACTICE. THAT NEEDLESSLY INCREASES COSTS TO THE STATE WHILE PLACING UNNECESSARY BURDENS ON THOSE WHO COULD BE ADEQUATELY SUPERVISED WITHOUT IT. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN A ROOM IN OPPOSITION. ANYONE OUTSIDE THE ROOM. AT&amp;T OPERATOR WILL GO TO THE LINES OF FOR OPPOSITION.

TO PETITIONERS ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY AT A COURT FEES NOT ONLY FAILED TO BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS REHABILITATIVE PURPOSES BUT OUR STATE HAS ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED ONLY A FRACTION OF FEES END UP BEING COLLECTED DUE TO INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS INABILITY TO PAY BY CAROTENE IS COURT FEE AB EIGHTEEN OH THREE NOT ONLY BRING PARITY TO THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF PROVIDING FINANCIAL RELIEF TO HAVE BEEN TO IT INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW INCOME.

ABOUT THE BUT YOU NAME A SOFT GOING ON A- LOGMEIN THAT COULD DIRECTOR OF COALITION CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. AND I HAVE MIX STEWART OPEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION THAT. GOOD MORNING- THIS IS MY FIRST TIME. BACK FROM MARCH FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY- THE SPACE TO BE BACK AT THE TABLE. AB WITH THIS BILL WE ASK FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE- WE WORK WITH CALVERT'S RECIPIENT OF MANY OF THEM GO TO THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM THAT WOULD SPEND ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN AFTER THEY GET THEIR TRAINING THEY GO OUT THAT THEY CAN'T GET A JOB BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE- THIS CRIMINAL TOUGH- CONVICTION ON THEIR RECORD. AND EXPUNGEMENT IS ONE WAY TO GET RID OF THAT SO THEY COULD GET A JOB AND THEN START ACTUALLY PAYING RESTITUTION THAT THEY MAY ALL AND WE JUST WANT TO OPEN UP A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO BE PREPARED. TO GET A JOB AND START PAYING RESTITUTION ALSO WOULD SIMPLIFY THE PLUSES VERY THAN HAVING EVERY DIFFERENT COURT TO COME UP WITH DIFFERENT PROCESSES WILL HAVE ONE WHO ALIGN PLUSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE SYSTEM AND SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS OF FLUID. TO RIVAL THANK YOU. HERE AS A PRESS ARE ON THE PHONE WAS ON THE PHONE. THIS IS NEXT DOOR TO AND CAN YOU HEAR ME MISTER CARE YES CAN HEAR YOU YOU MAY PROCEED EXCEPT. I CAN MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS NEXT DOOR TO ANNOUNCED. TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS A FORMER DEFENDANT WHO PERFORMS FLAWLESSLY ON PROBATION TO SEEK AND OBTAIN EXPANSION FROM THE COURT. WELCOME TO YOU DOES NOT PREVENT THE FENCE FROM BEING USED AS A PRIOR THAT PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE DOES NOT TERMINATE A PERSON'S OBLIGATION TO PAY VICTIM RESTITUTION IT DOES HELP OF FORMALLY CONVICTED PERSON SEEK LICENSURE. FIND HOUSING AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY FIND A JOB. THE PROMISE UNDER CURRENT LAW AN IMPOVERISHED DEFEND IS NOT ENTITLED TO AN EXPUNGEMENT WILL VICTIM RESTITUTION IS STILL OWED. WHAT THAT RULE WITH THE NEW REGIONALLY INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE PAYMENT VICTIM RESTITUTION BECAUSE THIS WILL PREVENT DEFENSE REFINING WORK IT HAS IN PRACTICE HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. BRING THE SAID ANOTHER WAY TO PAY RESTITUTION OF FORMER DEFENDANT NEED THE JOB TO GET A JOB FOR PARTISAN THAT NEEDS AN EXPUNGEMENT. UNDER CURRENT LAW YOU CAN'T GET A JOB UNTIL YOU GET AN EXPUNGEMENT. IF THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE LIKE CATCH TWENTY TWO THAT BECAUSE IT IS. WORTH AS A SOCIETY WE'RE DOING HERSELF NO FAVORS BY PUTTING BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY IN FRONT OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR WORK AND TRYING TO START OVER. AB TWO THREE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY GIVING FORMER DEFENSE THE RIGHT TO EXPUNGEMENT IF THEY HAVE PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY ON PROBATION FOR PREVIOUSLY UNABLE TO PAY RESTITUTION. AS A RESULT IN THE TNC. A BEACON TO DOES NOT TERMINATE DEPENDENCE OBLIGATION TO PAY RESTITUTION IN FACT LEADS EXISTING LEGAL PROVISIONS IN PLACE THAT ALLOW VICTIMS TO GARNISH ANY EVENTUAL SALARY EARNED BY THE DEFENDANT. BECAUSE EIGHTEEN OH THREE EASES THE PATH TOWARD REENTRY FOR CALIFORNIANS SEEKING TO START AGAIN AND BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE CHANCE OF THE VICTIMS WAX RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR ANY LOSS. IT'S A SMART LONG OVERDUE POLICY AND FOR THAT REASON WE HAVE HERE I'VE- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU. OKAY OF COURSE YOU HAVE IT I'M SORRY SO GOOD.

OKAY YEAH- FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN THE ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN MCCARTY A. B. NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT. MA'AM I GAVEL BACK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE I WAS AT CHARING- COMMITTEE. FOR THE BUDGET JUST UPSTAIRS AND- CAN WE BACK CARILLO COZY IN HERE YES. ALL I'M HERE PRESENT A BILL THAT THAT- YOU YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS WAS- HEARD LAST YEAR STARTED IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HAD A RIGOROUS DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE- SINCE WE STARTED THAT DEBATE A WEEK A YEAR AGO I WILL SAY THAT WE TOOK ROUGHLY FIFTY AMENDMENTS TO THIS AFTER HEARING FROM FIFTY AFTER HEARING FROM TO PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEES TO HELP COMMITTEES TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES AND COUNTLESS MEETINGS WITH ADVOCATE SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME CONSTERNATION ON THIS OVERALL TOPIC BUT WE HAVE LISTEN TO PEOPLE. AND TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER THE BIG PICTURE IS WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND DRUG ADDICTION AND WE KNOW THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE NOT A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE AND PEOPLE DON'T GET TREATMENT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FRANKLY SOMETIMES THEY COME OUT BEING BETTER DRUG ADDICTS AFTER INCARCERATION NOT NOT NOT ADDRESSING THEIR THEIR HABIT UNFORTUNATELY SO THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE PILOT PROGRAM WHICH WILL ALLOW THREE COUNTIES THAT AT THE MINIMUM RIGHT NOW THREE IN CALIFORNIA SANTA CLARA AND SAN JOAQUIN IN YELLOW. TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY CAN FIND DRUG TREATMENT OPTION FOR QUALIFYING INDIVIDUALS AGAIN- THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM AND JUDGES WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER THIS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF TREATMENT PROVIDERS- THIS IS- MEANT TO PROVIDE. ANOTHER OPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHO RIP WHO RIGHT NOW ARE GETTING- WHO ARE NOT PROVIDE WHO ARE NOT GETTING ADEQUATE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER. THIS IS EVIDENCE BASED WHICH WE CLARIFIED OVER AND OVER- THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE SENTENCED OTHERWISE TO GO TO EITHER A STATE PRISON OR COUNTY JAIL FOR A FOR A SENTENCE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS OTHERWISE WOULD BE GOING HOME. WITH AN ANKLE BRACELET AND IT'S SOME IT'S VERY SIMPLE- THIS IS AN OPTION AN INDIVIDUAL CAN GO SERVE THEIR SENTENCE OR THE COOPER BE PROVIDED WITH THE CHOICE TO GO GET TREATMENT IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. WE CLARIFY HERE AT THAT DISCRETION AB AND THAT THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. THAT THE TREATMENT WOULDN'T BE NO LONGER WITH THEN YOU'RE SET THEN YOU'RE UNDERLYING SENTENCE IF YOU DID GO THE ROUTE FOR INCARCERATIONS IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. BE LONGER IN THIS BY DOING- THE DRUG TREATMENTS- YOU KNOW SOMEONE SAY THAT THIS IS NOT. 100% VOLUNTARY ITS IT'S- CO WORSE I DON'T KNOW IT'S KIND OF IT'S ENCOURAGED CAJOLED AND SOME SAY THAT YOU KNOW. VOLUNTARY IS OUT 100% THE WAY TO GO BUT I DON'T KNOW I THINK SOME MANY OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES OF HEARD ABOUT INTERVENTIONS. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS VOLUNTARY WHEN FAMILY MEMBERS GO TO SOMEONE AND SAY HEY. WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE WE NEED YOU TO. SOMEONE TO STEP IT UP SOMETIME PEOPLE SAY. NO OVER AND OVER AND FINALLY THEY SAY YES SOMETIMES THEY SAY YES AND THEY FAIL. BUT THEY GOT BUT EVENTUALLY- THEY ARE ABLE TO GET HELP AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM. IS NOT WORKING THIS IS THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK WITH CONSERVATORSHIP. BUT THE SAME SIMILAR ISSUE WE KNOW THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS FAILING WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH- THE SYSTEM. AND UNFORTUNATELY GO BACK TO THE TO THE STREETS. AS AS UNDERLYING DRUG ADDICTS AND HAVE. ISSUES WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OVER AND OVER. WINDOWS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE THIS IS A PILOT. IT'S A SHORT TERM PILOT ALLOWS US TO TRY THIS- TRY THIS OUT IN A NUMBER OF COUNTIES. AND WE THINK THIS WILL PRODUCE. RESULTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IS A GOOD PLACE TO START- THIS WAS VETOED LAST YEAR BY THE GOVERNOR. HE DID ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS IN A VETO MESSAGE SO WE IF WE HAVE SENSE. I MET WITH THE ADVOCATES AND THE ANALYSIS NOTES ON PAGE SEVEN WE DO MAKE SOME CHANGES OUT OF THE GATE- CLARIFY. THAT- THE INDIVIDUAL B. THAT KNOWINGLY AND FOCUSING ON THIS THIS THIS DECISION WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO CHOOSE. AS WELL AS CLARIFYING THAT THE- THAT THE PROVIDERS OF THIS WILL BE- NOT A PROBATION OR PAROLE DEPARTMENTS BUT- THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMMUNITY BASED. NONPROFITS SENSUALLY THIS WON'T BE A LOCKDOWN FACILITY- SO WITH THAT- I WOULD ASK YOUR I VOTED ALLOW MY WITNESSES TO PARTICIPATE THIS MORNING THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU HAVE WITNESSES I DON'T THINK SO YES- GOOD MORNING THIS IS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF REISIG OF YOLO COUNTY. TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FRM SERIOUS SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS ARE GOING TO PRISONS AND JAILS FOR CRIMES THAT ARE MOTIVATED BY THEIR ADDICTION. AND PRISONS AND JAILS ARE SIMPLY NOT PLACES WHERE SICK PEOPLE GO TO GET BETTER. AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT PROPOSAL LOCAL TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE TO PRISON AND JAIL FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CONVICTED. OF FELONY LEVEL CRIMES MOTIVATED BY THEIR SERIOUS ADDICTION TO DRUGS BUT WHO POSE TOO MUCH OF A RISK FOR A JUDGE TO SIMPLY RELEASE THEM INTO AN UNSECURED RESIDENTIAL FACILITY IN THE COMMUNITY. WHERE THEY CAN SIMPLY WALK AWAY OR CRAWL OUT A WINDOW ON DAY ONE. AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS INSTEAD. AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT INDIGENTS CREATING A SECURE HOSPITAL LIKE TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT JAIL BARS AND GUARDS AND GUNS. THAT CAN SERVE AS A SANCTUARY FOR SERIOUSLY ADDICTED FELONY OFFENDERS WHO VOLUNTARILY. CHOOSE TO TRY LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN A SAFE AND SECURE SETTING. INSTEAD OF JUST BEING WAREHOUSE BEHIND BARS WE CALL THIS PLACE HOPE CALIFORNIA WHAT ALSO MAKES THIS TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE UNIQUE IS THAT IT WILL BE DESIGNED AND STAFFED BY TREATMENT PROVIDERS. AND THEY WILL DECIDE WHO IS AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE AND WHO IS NOT. AND WHAT THE TREATMENT SHOULD LOOK LIKE. FOR THOSE SUCCESS CHIU INCOME TREATMENT OVER PRINTING. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS EXPUNGED AND THEY WILL GET A CLEAN START RIGHT HERE AT HOME. ULTIMATELY AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT IT'S A VERY MEASURED PILOT BILL WITH JUST A FEW COUNTIES. THAT IS DESIGNED TO OFFER A VOLUNTARY TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES TO THOSE WHO ARE OTHERWISE ON THEIR WAY TO PRISON OR JAIL. I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO GIVE THIS PILOT PROGRAM A CHANCE. THANK YOU. THE IS THE- OF THE WITNESS. ANY BROWN HELLO I'M MARK. YOU MAY BE GETTING A HEARING. YES OKAY YERLI- HELLO I CAN START. HELLO HELLO- OF THE COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY PARKS AND MCCARTY HI MY NAME IS ANTHONY BROWN AND I WOULD LIKE. TO OFFER MY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT THE HOPE CALIFORNIA.

OF THAT STATE BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND TWO THOUSAND UNTIL. THE NUMBER OF PARTS OF THE STATE PRESENCE REPUBLICAN VIEWS OFFENSES. HAVE INCREASED FROM. I'M NOT PROUD TO ADMIT THAT BUT IN ALL HONESTY I AM SICK OF THOSE NUMBERS. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY TO GIVE SPACE. TO GIVE A FAKE WITHOUT THE TEST NEXT.

I THINK THE ENTERPRISE OF DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY AGO OUR VALLEY THEY PRESIDENT AVENAL STATE PRISON KERN VALLEY STATE PRISON CALIFORNIA TO PREVENT CALIFORNIA MEN'S COLONY AND HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON. I SET UP A SHARED IT WITH YOU TO PAY A PICTURE WOULD THEN. FROM A. B. TWENTY EIGHT. THE PASSAGE AT THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHAT IT IN INDIVIDUALS LIKE MAYBE PART MEMBER OF UP TO. BY ADDRESSING ADDICTION EARLY LIFE. I LIVED UP BY CRITICAL AND PRO. OUTSIDE TWO THIRDS TO OPEN CULTURE. I HAVE BEEN ADDICTED TO STOP WITH THE IS THE CHOICE TO GET WELL- THE BY COERCION. BUT TO GET TO WHERE I AM TODAY I IT KNOWLEDGE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE CLOTHES ARE MARK. I KNOW I'M HEART THAT. WE RIGHT BUT I COULDN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT WAS WRONG. I KNOW IT TOOK TIME AND SOMETIMES THAT'S- WHAT I FILLED OUT WE COULD SAVE IT TIME. AND TIME IS MONEY AND MORE IMPORTANT TIME TO FLY. THE HOPE CALIFORNIA BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL OPERATE A MOLD A ROAD MAP TO DESTINATION IT TOOK ME TWENTY TWO YEARS TO ACHIEVE.

THANK YOU KNOW HIT HERE FROM WITNESSES AND- IN THE ROOM. GOOD MORNING CHAIR JOINS SOMEWHERE AND- MEMBERS TIRING THE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES WE REPRESENT COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT WE WERE PREVIOUSLY IN OPPOSITION TO THAT BUT VERSION LAST YEAR AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO- AND- IN DARK. WE HAVE A STRONG COALITION OF TREATMENT ADVOCATES AS WELL AS STRESS THE SYSTEM ADVOCATES BETTER IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- WOULD LIKE TO READ THAT- YOU KNOW GOVERNOR NEW SO I'M I'M VETO THIS BILL LAST YEAR STATING THAT I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE THAT EFFECTIVELY READS TO FORCE TREATMENT. I AM ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF SUCH TREATMENT GIVEN THAT EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT COURSE THE TREATMENT HINDERS PARTICIPANTS LONG TERM RECOVERY. I FROM THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE- CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNOR WERE DRESSED IN AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT- AND YOU KNOW JUST TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE I'M- THIS BILL IS NOT EVIDENCE BASED ON WHICH OUR SYSTEM OF ADDICTION TREATMENT THROUGH THE PUBLIC SYSTEM HAS BEEN BUILT UPON THROUGH A SAM. AND THREE MEDIC COW MEDIC COW CANNOT COVER THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM AND WE SEE THAT THIS BILL IT'S BEEN EXPANDED TO ADDITIONAL COUNTIES THIS YEAR- AND WE FEAR- YOU KNOW AT THAT. THE OUTCOMES AT THE END OF THE DAY WILL NOT BE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING FOR- IT'LL HARM PARTICIPANTS AND WE ALSO- OR SIGN THIS BILL IS ALSO NOT A NEW IDEA- THIS IS BEEN TRIED BEFORE. WE NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON VOLUNTARY TREATMENT INVESTMENT AND HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES NOT INTO AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB. NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR NUMBERS- LISA LEWIS HERE ON BEHALF THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN OPPOSITION. A DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION ADVOCATING FOR DRUG POLICIES GROUNDED IN SCIENCE COMPASSION HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS STILL WITH THIS BILL- OF JULY TENSION TO TWO OF THEM. THE FIRST IS THE IMPACT IT'LL HAVE ON BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS THE BILL STILL FAILS TO ENSURE THE PILOTS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A RACIALLY EQUITABLE MANNER. TO PREVENT THE UNNECESSARY INCARCERATION OF BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS. ARREST RATES FROM TWENTY TWENTY DEMONSTRATE THAT BLACK AND LATINOS HAVE UNFAIRLY TARGETED HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY TARGETED FOR DRUG ARRESTS. LATINOS CONSIST CONSTITUTED FORTY TWO POINT 4% OF ALL FELONY DRUG ARREST AND WHAT CALIFORNIANS MADE UP THIRTEEN POINT 3% OF ARRESTED DESPITE MAKING UP ONLY SIX POINT 5% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. THE SECOND CONCERN IS THAT THE BILLS OPPOSED BY EVERY STATE TREATMENT ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. THE SCIENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE EFFICACY OF COURSE TREATMENT. AND ON THE CONTRARY DEMONSTRATES THAT IS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE AND COSTLY. TREATMENT PROFESSIONALS RECOMMEND MOVING AWAY FROM MANDATED TREATMENT AND TOWARDS EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES THAT WE KNOW WORK. THIS INCLUDES LOW BARRIER COMMUNITY DRUG TREATMENT OVERDOSE OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE OUTREACH. THE PATH TO RECOVERY IS NOT LINEAR IT OFTEN INVOLVES RELAPSES AND FOR THIS REASON WE MUST INSTEAD INVESTING RESOURCES INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. TO FACILITATE TREATMENT AND ROMAN ONCE A PERSON IS READY TO TAKE THAT STEP. AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT WITH THE TRACK FROM THESE EFFORTS AND DIVERT RESOURCES THAT COULD BE BETTER USED IN THE COMMUNITY. WE DO NOT DISAGREE THAT MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT REPACKAGING A PROVEN FAILED POLICY WILL NOT WORK AND FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES SUCH AS POVERTY TRAUMA AND THE ENDURING IMPACTS OF RACISM. AND OTHER FORMS OF OPPRESSION. WE ALSO FEAR THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL PUT CALIFORNIA ON A DANGEROUS PATH TOWARDS RE PURPOSING JAILS AND POSSIBLY PRISONS FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AS WE KNOW FIFTY YEARS OF ENFORCING THE WAR ON DRUGS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WOULD BEAR THE BRUNT OF THIS ENFORCEMENT. AND MEMBERS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE DISPROPORTIONATELY FORCED INTO LAW TREATMENT AND LONGER JAIL SENTENCES. SENTENCING A PERSON TO DRUG TREATMENT INSIDE A LOCKED FACILITY IS STILL CRIMINALIZATION AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE JOURNAL ABOUT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I'M SORRY BUT WE'RE STILL IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. HEY THANK YOU. YEAH THE REDNESS IS DAN ACCORD I'M ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER IN STRONG OPPOSITION. FRED WILLIAMS ACLU CAL ACTION IN OPPOSITION.

HI THIS YEAR TEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PORTION OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS IN OPPOSITION OF. THANK YOU RIDE ONE THIRTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. AND. ONE THREE ONE. BY ONE THIRTY TO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THIS IS DEBORAH WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU M. WHEN SAMPLING YOU KNOW FREEDOM ALL AND PROJECT IT MAY NOT IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO NOT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR. QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. MISTER BRIAN- STRUGGLING HARD WITH THIS ONE- I KNOW THE AUTHORS AND IT YOU KNOW HEART- ONE OF THE THINGS STRUGGLING WITH IS CONTROLLED SUGGESTED. NOT I THINK THE WORD WE'RE HEARING FROM OPPOSITION IS DIRECTLY. AND EVEN IN THE EXAMPLE THAT THAT WAS GIVEN ABOUT A FAMILY MEMBERS THEY SAY NO THEY SAY NO AND AT ONE TIME THEY SAY YES. THAT THE NO HERE IS NOT CARE IT'S NOT TREATMENT IT'S NOT SUPPORT- WHICH IS WHY THE DIRECT FEELING AS BEING FELT SO IF THIS MOVES OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I HOPE THAT THAT CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE WORKSHOPS I KNOW FIFTY AMENDMENTS AS A LOT- IT IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK FIFTY AMENDMENTS AND- FOLK STILL FRUSTRATED IS ALSO. TIMING THINGS WELL- SO BUT I THINK YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS EVER BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT. CONVERSATION THAT WE GET PEOPLE TO CARE THAT THEY NEED AND THAT THEY DON'T. GET THEIR MENTAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND HEALTH TREATMENT AND OUR JOB IS TO LEASE WITH THEIR CURRENT AGAIN. DR WEBER. GOOD MORNING- SO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD WOULD QUALIFY FOR THIS PILOT PROGRAM HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A QUALIFYING DRUG MOTIVATED FELONY CRIME IS THAT CORRECT. YES THEY PUT COMMITTED OF A NON DRUG-OFFENSE AND GIVE ME SOME FINDING BY THE COURT AND- THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT THAT IT'S RELATED TO A DRUG ADDICTION. SO THERE OPTION WOULD BE TO EITHER GO TO JAIL OR GO TO THIS FACILITY CORRECT AND WE KNOW THAT GOING TO JAIL HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO REALLY HELP WITH ADDICTION. SO THIS IS WHY THIS IS BEING OFFERED. EXACTLY IT'S A PILOT PROJECT AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME HORRIFIC OUTCOMES BUT THAT'S BUDGET TEST THINGS THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE PILOTS IT'S A FEW COUNTY PILOT LIKE IT'S MY LAST TIME I CHECKED WAS A FIVE YEAR PILOTS AND WE'RE GOING TO- MONITOR PEOPLE WHO WENT THROUGH IT TO SEE IF THEY HAVE. YOU KNOW THEIR RELAPSE NUMBERS WERE BETTER OR WORSE THAN INDIVIDUALS WHO DIDN'T GO THROUGH IT- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT STATUS QUO IS NOT. EFFECTIVE YEAH EXACTLY RIGHT- YEAH I GUESS THAT'S- WHAT I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT WHEN LISTING LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION WHAT ARE THERE WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS SO. IF THE OPTION IS BETWEEN GOING TO JAIL WHICH WE KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY TREAT YOUR ADDICTION OR TO GIVE YOU THE EDUCATION AND THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME VERSUS ACTUALLY. GOING INTO A PILOT PROGRAM THAT IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON HELPING YOU OVERCOME YOUR ADDICTION- HI I'M CONFUSED. AS TO THAT THAT THAT THAT THE NATURE OF THE OPPOSITION- I WOULD. RECOMMEND THOUGH I KNOW YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF AMENDMENT- FROM HEALTH CARE STANDPOINT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO THINGS THAT ARE. EVIDENCE BASED AND SO IF THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE LIKE ASM YOU KNOW TO TRY TO ALIGN THE CRITERIA AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE. I KNOW THAT- WE THROUGH THIS I. HAS NO LAW FACILITY WHICH PROBABLY WOULD NEED IN THIS CASE- BUT JUST TRY TO ALIGN IT AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE THE OTHER THING YOU JUST MENTIONED WITH THE- TIMELINE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM AND I KNOW THIS WAS A BILL THAT CAME UP LAST YEAR. I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO AND- IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO THAT WOULD NOT GIVE FIVE YEARS- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S BEEN ANY CONVERSATION. ABOUT EXTENDING THAT. DEADLINE OF THE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM BUT IT SAYS IT WOULD END IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX BUT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INTRODUCING AND CLARIFYING FOR ME WHO WOULD ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND WHAT THE OPTION WOULD BE IF THEY CHOSE NOT TO. TO ACTUALLY DO THIS PILOT PROGRAM. THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR. DID YOU ANSWER LETTER YEAH. WHAT THE SOMEONE EVERY WEEK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FIVE YEARS IF THERE IS A DRAFTING ERROR THAT WILL GO BACK AND CLARIFY. AND WE DO CONCUR THAT IT SHOULD BE- RESEARCH- DRIVEN AND BASED UPON- EDUCATIONAL SENSE SO- WE HAVE THAT IN THERE WE DID THAT LAST YEAR AND- YOU CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AND- MAKE SURE IT'S EVEN STRONGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VIRGINIA QUESTIONS. THE THIRTY TO CLARIFY THIS MCCARTY AT JUST PLEASE SHARE MORE ABOUT THE KIND OF FEEDBACK WE WOULD GET. AT THE END OF THIS PILOT. YEAH I THINK THERE IS SOME SUCH A SUGGESTION IN HERE FROM THAT HAVE SO MANY PAPERS IN FRONT OF ME I THINK IT'S- NONSENSE. IT ABOUT THE- CLEAR. THAT YOU. UNTIL ON THE REPORT BACK AND I WOULD THINK THAT YEAH WE WOULD WANT TO NOT JUST TO TRADITIONAL REPORT ON THE PILOT HOUSE DOING BUT INTERIM MEASURES THROUGHOUT THE AND YOU KNOW- ANY DATA THE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE THROUGH THIS AND WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU KNOW PROMISING- PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO A PILOT. BECAUSE IF THIS WORKS MAYBE WANT TO GO TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO- WE DO HAVE THAT HAVE THAT REPORTING AND I THINK THAT THE SUGGESTIONS IN HERE ARE GOOD ONE SYMBOL. IN CORPORATE THAT INTO THE BILL. JUST TO CLARIFY IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY. IF YOU WANNA. REFER JUST TO CLARIFY IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY AT SO IT SO THIS IS FOR AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS COMMITTED A FELONY BUT WE KNOW THAT IT IS A SUBSTANCE ABUSE DRIVEN- THAT THAT. ACT ISSUE HAS CAUSED THEM TO COMMIT THAT FELONY- ARE THERE ANY OTHER PARAMETERS AROUND. THAT THIS BEING AN AVAILABLE OPTION FOR THE YES AND I GET SOMEWHAT CONFUSED WITH THE FIFTY AND THE CHANGES WE TOOK LAST YEAR BUT MAYBE I CAN HAVE MY MAIN WITNESS THAT THE DA FROM YOLO COUNTY MISTER RISING I BELIEVE WE HAD IT. THAT WITH THESE WERE NOT- STRIKE OFFENSES AND NONVIOLENT OFFENSES WOULD BE THE ONES WHO WOULD BE KEPT CATEGORIZED HERE AND I BELIEVE WE ALSO. EXEMPTED OUT- THAT TO NINETY SIX SEX CRIMES. IS THAT CORRECT MR RISING. THAT'S CORRECT IT WOULD NOT APPLY FOR- SECOND CHANCES AND THEN SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES WOULD BE EXCLUDED BUT ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL CONVICTED OF A FELONY OFFENSE THAT WAS FOUND TO BE DRUG MOTIVATED COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSESSMENT AND CHOOSING TREATMENT OVER PRISON. WHAT DID YOU HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION ONE MORE QUESTION. SO ARE ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT FIT INTO THIS CATEGORY. WITH THEY'D BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE INSTEAD OF JAIL PROBATION INSTEAD OF JAIL TIME. AT THE END OF THEIR TERM YES BUT THE BUT THEY ARE ARE THEY ARE SENTENCED. AND THIS WOULD BE A CHOICE IN LIEU OF THEIR SENTENCE SO IN OTHER WORDS WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMEBODY GO THROUGH THIS IF THEY COULD OTHERWISE BE. SENT HOME- MISTER I THINK YOU WANT TO CLARIFY FOR MISSING ANYTHING THERE. NO THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THE IDEA BEHIND THIS PROGRAM IS THAT THE TREATMENT PROGRAM WOULD NEVER EXCEED. THE SENTENCE THAT THE JUDGE WOULD OTHERWISE GIVE THE PERSON. AND THAT'S DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE THIS IS NOT TO NOTICE IT'S TREATMENT OR WHATEVER THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES WHETHER THAT'S PRISON OR JAIL. JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION ON THAT ARE THERE ANY BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED NON NON VIOLENCE OF NON SERIOUS AND TOOK SEVERAL THINGS OUT- IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY ARE ANY OF THE CRIMES THAT WOULD BE IN THIS OPTION ONES WITH THE JUDGE CURRENTLY HAS THE DISCRETION TO SENTENCE YOU TO COMMUNITY SUPERVISION INVOLUNTARY. TREATMENT CENTER. YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT CHANGES I THINK THAT THIS I ONLY INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. ARE SENTENCED TO THAT THAT THAT TERM SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONSTERS YOUR YEARS AND THIS WOULD BE PROVIDED AS AN OPTION I DON'T THINK THIS AT ALL- UNDER CUTS YOU KNOW JUDICIAL DISCRETION FRIEND FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE- YOU KNOW PLACE ON COMMUNITY RELEASED HER PROBATION. MISTER ISAAC CAN YOU CLEAR THAT AS WELL. THAT'S RIGHT THE JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION TO YOU KNOW GIVE THE INDIVIDUAL SENSE OF ANY LENGTH. AND IF IT'S A- I THINK THE QUESTION IS FOCUSED ON A VERY SHORT SENTENCE PERHAPS WITH PROBATIONARY TIME AND ENERGY ALL TIME THEN THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AN APPROPRIATE. SITUATION FOR THE TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE. BECAUSE IT JUST WOULDN'T BE THE TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE PERSON TO PARTICIPATE THIS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE RECEIVING NO LONGER SENTENCES PRISON SENTENCES LONG JAIL SENTENCES WHO ARE DRUG ADDICTED. AND THEIR CRIME WAS MOTIVATED BY DRUG BUSINESS TO GIVE THEM A TREATMENT PATH THAT THEY'RE CHOOSING INSTEAD OF. THE SENTENCESENTENCE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US FOR OVER A YEAR ON THIS AND- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT IS- AS SUMMER BRAIN NOTED. SOMEWHAT AWKWARD- WORKING ON A BILL THAT IS OPPOSED BY INDIVIDUALS THAT I'VE- AUTHOR GOES ON WITH THEIR SUPPORT OVER THE YEARS ON REFORMING OUR YOU KNOW. OUR PAROLE- SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA- BRINGING ABOUT VOTING RIGHTS FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED YOU KNOW WORKING ON BANNING THE BOX SO I AND I FULLY SUPPORT TO HOW WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO BRING ABOUT SMART REFORMS. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING I DON'T BELIEVE IN WAREHOUSING ANY. ANYMORE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HI I'M TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE THAT WE DO HAVE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HOW TO BRING ABOUT THE BEST RESULTS FOR THEM. AND I WILL ADMIT THAT I WOULD RATHER. FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN THE COMING JUSTICE SYSTEM. ON AND YOU KNOW FOCUSING ON SUCCESS IN HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT I KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON BILLS ON THAT ISSUE BUT THIS IS A SEPARATE ISSUES ARE INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THEY'RE RELEASED HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED THROUGH ON THE PATH. TO SUCCESS AND THIS IS- YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE. UNCOMFORTABLE ISSUES THEY WERE DEALING WITH IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE SAME DEBATE ABOUT. MENTAL HEALTH AND CONSERVATORSHIP MAYBE ON THIS COMMITTEE BUT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- I THINK WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON A NEW APPROACH BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING IT'S FAILING US IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A PILOT. AGAIN IT'S A PILOT THIS ISN'T A MANDATE FOR CALIFORNIA. WE TRY THINGS SOMETIMES WE TRY THINGS ALL THE TIME SOMETIMES THEY WORK SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WORK I HOPE THIS IS AFFECTED THAT'S THE PLAN THAT'S WHY WE'RE OFFERING IT. BUT WORST CASE SCENARIO WE REALIZE YOU KNOW WHAT. MAYBE THIS WASN'T AN APPROACH ON IS IT GOING TO RUIN LIVES BY HAVING PEOPLE DO MORE- DRUG TREATMENT WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED PROBABLY NOT I THINK IT'S THE ONLY UPSIDE HERE- AND WITH THAT. I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES AS WE- PUT THIS ISSUE- CLOSER TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THIS YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU- DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. THEIR MOTION. SHARE REMOVED. GOOD. AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT BY SOME OF OUR MCCARTY THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI. LACKEY ABSTAINED BONTA I'VE BONTA HI BRIAN HI. BRIAN I WEBER. WEBER I SANTIAGO. SAN DIEGO BY MATT. SMITH OBTAINED. THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU WE WILL NOW HAVE A MR RODRIGUEZ- FARMS AND SERIALIZED. FIRE THE ITEM THIRTEEN LUCKY THIRTEEN. MAYBE NOT SO. EIGHTEEN SIX NINE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE WHICH WOULD MAKE POSSESSION OF IT UNSER LICE FARM OR FARM WITH AN ALTERED OR REMOVED ZERO NUMBER NUMBER PUNISHABLE AS A FELONY HAVING SERIAL NUMBERS ON FARMS IS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR PREVENTION AND INVESTIGATION OF GUN VIOLENCE WITHOUT ZERO NUMBERS LAW ENFORCEMENT IS UNABLE TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER DISTRIBUTOR IMPORTER RETAILER AND OTHERS INVOLVED TO LEARN WHO PURCHASED A FARM AND THEIR CONNECTION TO A POTENTIAL CRIME. GHOST GUNS ARE TRACKED OF THE CRIMINALS FOR THAT REASON BECAUSE THEY DO NOT REQUIRE A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR PURCHASES AND THEY ARE UNTRACEABLE TAMON FORSMAN IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE THAT MANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE REPORTING INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF COURSE GUN SEIZURES AND RECOVERIES FOR EXAMPLE THE LOS SOUNDS POLICE DEPARTMENT SHE'S NEARLY 4100% MORE GHOST GUNS SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT REPORTED AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 27100% SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED FARMS OAKLAND RECEIVED NEARLY THESE COMMITTEES HAVE TURNED TO BANNING GHOST GUNS INCLUDING SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND THE CITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES OKRENT SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS ALSO CONSIDERING ABOUT THIS PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS HAS LED THE BUDGET ADMINISTRATION GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE INCREASING NUMBERS OF GHOST GUNS I APPLAUD ALL THEIR EFFORTS ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND BELIEVE THAT A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE IS ANOTHER ELEMENT NEEDED TO PREVENT THOSE GUNS FROM CAUSING MORE GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHILE THEIR EFFORTS FOCUSED ON SUPPLY OF GHOST GUNS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THE FARMS CURRENTLY IN THE COMMUNITIES OR TO SUFFICIENTLY DETER SOMEONE FROM PURCHASING OR BEING IN POSSESSION OF THESE FIREARMS LAST YEAR THE LOS SOUTH STREET APARTMENT. RELEASED A REPORT STATING THAT COSTA AS WERE INVOLVED IN THAN ONE HUNDRED VIOLENT CRIME. INCLUDED TWENTY FOUR MURDERS IT ATTEMPTED HOMICIDES AND DOZENS OF ARMED ROBBERIES AND ASSAULTS. LAST WEEK SACRAMENTO COUNTY CHURCH SHOOTING INVOLVED A GHOST GUN. DESPITE HAVING A RESTRAINING ORDER AND WHAT SOUNDS LIKE ISSUES WITH MENTAL HEALTH HE HAD AN A. R. FIFTEEN STYLE RIFLE GHOST GUN. THAT WAS USED TO KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE. THIS STORY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO TACKLING ONE OF THE BIGGEST PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS WE ARE FACING. AGAIN WHILE APPLAUD THE WORK OF THE- TO ELIMINATE THE SUPPLY OF GOES GUNS WE NEED TO TAKE MORE ABOUT THE DATE DEMAND. WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY SUPPORT IS NICOLE CAN KNOWN AS ON BEHALF OF EVERY TOWN FOR GUN SAFETY. AND I BELIEVE SHE'S ON THE PHONE. HELLO EVERYBODY GOOD MORNING CHAIR NUMBERED THE COKING SOMETHING AND EVERYTOWN FOR GUN SAFETY MOMS DEMAND ACTION AND DIDN'T DEMAND ACTION REPORT AND- SIX NINE OUR OUR- AND THEN ONE. ON IT ACT Q.

OKAY BACK THING GOT GOTTEN WILL SOME ACQUIRE IT FIREARM AND THEIR IN A CAR OR ACT THAT TRACKING. FOR THE REASON THE PORT E. DE. NINE YEAH. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN A ROW IN SUPPORT. YES SIR. MORNING PUT IT DOWN FOR THE VERSE I KIND OF AS FAR ON BEHALF OF- THE SUREST BARMAN AND CHURCH BIANCO SUPPORT THE THANK YOU THANK. ANY OUTSIDE THE ROOM. THE MAY GO TO TELEPHONE LINE WITH AND- OF AB EIGHTY SIXTY NINE RODRIGUEZ. IF THERE IS A PART OF AB EIGHT SIX NINETY MAY PRESS ONE ONE ZERO AGAIN THAT'S AND THEN IF AREN'T OF AB. EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE. WE WILL GO TO LINE ONE FIFTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER KAREN MEMBERS BRENDAN UP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SUPPORT THANK YOU. NEXAVAR LINE EIGHTY EIGHT. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI GOOD MORNING THIS IS AT ONE FOUR BONE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF ONTARIO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE LOST SUPPORT AND YOU AT THE TIME. GOOD THEN WILL GO TO- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND BEAR IN A- HEARING ROOM. MY NAME IS MARCO GEORGIA I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE IS NOT NEEDED AS THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR OF THIS BILL NOTED THE RECOVERY OF GHOST GUNS IS USUALLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMISSION OF ANOTHER CRIME FOR WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL FACE MUCH MORE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. RANGING FROM A YEAR FOR ARMED WITH A FIREARM TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE FOR USE OF THE FIREARMS RESULTING IN DEATH. THIS BILL WILL NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO CRIMINALS IT WILL NOT DETER CRIME. WHAT AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE WILL DO IS SEND MORE BLACK AND BROWN CALIFORNIANS TO JAIL OR PRISON IT WILL IMPOVERISH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. IT WILL PERMANENTLY CAN LIMIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FELONY CONVICTIONS TO LOW PAYING JOBS BECAUSE MANY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND BETTER PAYING JOBS ARE OPEN TO FELONS. IT WASTE TAXPAYERS MONEY IMPRISONING PEOPLE WALK CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING GO WANTING FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING. C. PDA INSTEAD URGES YOU TO ADOPT A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO THE PANDEMIC OF GUNS IN OUR STATE. IT WOULD BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND HUMANE. CALIFORNIA HAS REDUCE SMOKING BY A COMBINATION OF TAXES ON CIGARETTES BANS ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC SPACES AND EDUCATION SUCH A MULTI PRONG STRATEGY SHOULD BE EMPLOYED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF GHOST GUNS IN CALIFORNIA. ALSO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO BRING PUBLIC NUISANCE LAWSUITS AGAINST INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES TO MANUFACTURE GHOST GUNS OR GHOST GUN MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT. SERIOUS FINANCIAL PENALTIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO DETER THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR COMPANIES THAN CRIMINAL PENALTIES AGAINST THE UNWITTING INDIVIDUAL WHO POSSESSES SUCH A WEAPON. AND JUST ON THAT- INSTANCE I WOULD SAY THAT APPARENTLY NOW ON THE INTERNET YOU CAN ORDER A QUICK MINUTE SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN GHOST KIND AT HOME. SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY IN CALIFORNIA TO TAX. SO THERE'S NO REASON THAT THESE MACHINES SHOULD NOT BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO ON BEHALF OF C. P. D. A. R. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WHAT IS THAT. THAT'S GOOD OKAY HI FRED WILLIAMS A SAY YOU CAL ACTION- ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS ABOUT CURRENCY PDA AND AFTER NOBLE ON THIS BILL- WELL WE- DEFINITELY APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON GHOST GUNS WE DO. UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OUR COMMUNITIES IT IS OUR VIEW THAT- INCREASE IMPRISONMENT AND REYES FROM MISDEMEANOR TO A FELONY IS NOT THE CORRECT WAY TO DO THIS. THERE ARE ALREADY A MYRIAD OF PENALTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO COMMITS AN OFFENCE WHILE ARMED WITH ANY KIND OF FIREARM OR USE A FIREARM DURING THE OFFENSE. DISABILITY RIGHT FROM ADDITIONAL YEAR TO COUNTY JAIL TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE IN STATE PRISON DEPENDING ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCE. BILLS SUCH AS THE THAT INCREASE PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS TO FELONIES WITH A FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA'S MASS INCARCERATION CRISIS AND HAVE BEEN ROLLED BACK BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SHOWN TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND HARMFUL. MASS INCARCERATION POLICIES RESULT IN OVER POLICING AND OVER INCARCERATION OF BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS DIVERTING RESOURCES AWAY FROM SCHOOLS HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING. IS FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NOBLE ON THIS BILL THANK. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN A ROOM. IN OPPOSITION. AND WE NOW GO TO THE- AT&amp;T LINE IT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION OF AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE THAT MANY ZERO. AGAIN IT IS ONE THEN ZERO FOR ANY OPPOSITION AB. EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE FORTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN A NEW WAY ALIVE AND WE STRONGLY- OPPOSE AB. EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK ONLINE OF ONE THIRTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU AND WE DO HAVE ONE MORE ONE MOMENT PLEASE.

PEOPLE OF COLOR SORRY LEVEL. THANK YU. THANK YOU NEXT GO TO LINE THIRTY SAY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. DURING THE THAT MEANS AFTER WOULD NOT OF US ARE OR COUNTY AND WE ARE ENOUGH. TO THANK YOU I MISS CHERRY NOW FOR OPPOSITE TO GIVE THIS TIME. THANK YOU- BUT BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BUT MISTER SMITH- WHAT DO WE CONSIDER IT WOULD YOU WOULD CONSIDER AMENDING SECTION TWO OF THIS BILL TO MAKE MANUFACTURING A FIREARM WITHOUT A OBTAINING A SERIAL NUMBER A WOBBLER WHICH WOULD GIVE THE JUDGE THE DISCRETION OF THE TO GIVE IT UP INCREMENTALLY GOING FORWARD BUT GOING STRAIGHT TO A FELONY- COULD BE EXTREME IN SOME CASES. AND IT WASN'T A CRIME A FEW YEARS AGO SO I DON'T KNOW IF OU ARE UP TO TAKE A ANY AMENDMENTS.% THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT YES I'M OPEN TO ANY TYPE OF- AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL I THINK THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO. SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO TURN THE VICTORS FROM POSSESSION OWNERSHIP OF THESE FIREARMS SO. ANY HELP IS OR A CHANGES IS WELCOMED AND I'M OPEN TO THAT AS WELL AS LONG AS EVERYONE ELSE AS WELL BUT ALMOST UP TO THE CHURCH QUESTION BUT I'M OPEN TO IT. YES OKAY. ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. YOU MAY CLOSE. MISTER CHAIRMAN WITHOUT CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR TRYING TO FIND AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH MY POLICY GOES WILD DRESSED IN THE CONCERNS OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE IS CONCERNED ABOUT INCARCERATED MORE INDIVIDUALS AND THE IMPACT THIS POLICY MAY HAVE A SPECIAL ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH. HOW DANGEROUS INCOME OF THESE GHOST GUNS HAVE BECOME AS MANY OF YOU KNOW MY SON IS A DEPUTY SHERIFF AND HE TOLD ME MONTHLY HE GETS ONE TO TWO OF THESE FARMS OFF THE STREETS AND THAT'S JUST THEM. AS A TO AND LOCAL. WE MUST DETER OFFENDERS FROM POSSESSION THESE FARMS WHICH ARE MADE. TO INTENSIVELY. COMMITTEE CRIME FOR MURDER. I HOPE ALL OF YOU. KNOW THAT I WILL CONTINUE THIS FIGHT TO REMOVE THESE DANGEROUS WEAPONS FROM OUR STREETS AND A WE HAPPILY WELCOME. THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH ANYONE WILLING TO ADDRESS. THE POSSESSION AND OWNERSHIP OF GHOST. WITH THAT I RESPECT YOU HAVE FOR I WILL. YOU DO A PROMOTION- IS THERE A SECOND. OKAY THANK YOU SO THIS ONE ACTUALLY WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME BECAUSE I. OBVIOUSLY I. HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FELONIES THIS ISN'T JUST IN GENERAL- NOT ONLY IS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT JUST PRSONALLY AND WHATNOT THEY ACTUALLY GET. TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE BUT I ALSO HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH GUNS ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE YOUR SON WORKS THAT IT IS A IT IS A PROBLEM- WHILE I. PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT WE'VE THE BEST WAY WE COULD SOLVE THE GUN PROBLEM IF WE JUST TAKE THE GUNS OUT OF ALL MEN BECAUSE MEN ARE THE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH GUNS- AT THE DAY CO YOU AND NOT. THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S WHICH SOME CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES WITH WITH HAVING THAT KIND OF- MOVEMENT- AND SO I'M I'M- NOT VOTING BUT IF IT DOESN'T MAKE IT- WE TWEAK. LET'S GET TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO NEXT. THANK YOU A CALDERON.

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATOR BATES AND- PUBLIC SAFETY MEMBER OF SOME WOMEN SAY ARTIFICAL AUTHORING THE BILL ONCE IT GETS AMENDED- AB FIFTEEN NINETY SEVEN WILL HELP KERR OF THE WAVE OF THEFT IN OUR STATE BY RESTORING SERIAL THEFT PROVISIONS THAT WERE IN LAW PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. AND ALLOW IT TO BE PUT BEFORE THE VOTERS. THESE PROVISIONS ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO AT ADEQUATELY CHARGE REPEAT OFFENDERS UPON THEIR FOURTH THEFT CONVICTION. EVERY DAY I HEAR FROM FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT THAT THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE ANYMORE. IT IS A FACT THAT CRIME HAS RISEN IN OUR STATE RECENT NEWS STORIES HAVE EVEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THEFT HAS RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY IN CALIFORNIA AND HAS LED RETAILERS TO ANNOUNCE PLANS TO SHUT DOWN OR SLASH THEIR HOURS IN RESPONSE TO RAMPANT SHOPLIFTING. ACCORDING TO LAPD DATA THROUGH NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH PROPERTY CRIME IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS UP OVER THE SAME PERIOD OF TWENTY TWENTY ROBBERY IS UP OVER TWENTY TWENTY AS WELL AND CAR THEFTS ARE UP NEARLY FIFTY THREE PERCENT. SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN WE'VE BEEN ADDRESSING THE ORGANIZED NATURE OF THEFT BUT WE ALSO MUST INCLUDE TOUGHER CONSEQUENCES TO DETER REPEAT OFFENDERS- ANY AS YOU ALL KNOW I AM INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ENSURING SECOND CHANCES ARE AVAILABLE. TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR STATE BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF THE SAME CRIME. FOR THE FOURTH TIME SO WE NEED TO GO. GET THEM THE HELP THAT THEY NEED- WHICH PROP FORTY SEVEN ELIMINATED THAT ABILITY. SO THE REPEAL. OF SYRUP THAT STATUTE WAS A MISTAKE THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THAT TODAY WITH AB FIFTEEN NINETY SEVEN AND PUT BEFORE THE VOTERS. JOINING ME TODAY ON THE PHONE IS LIEUTENANT BRANDON AB LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND I'LL HAND IT OVER TO LIEUTENANT UP IF HE IS THERE. THANK YOU THE AGENCY OPERATOR YOU CAN OPEN UP THE LINES FOR A- WTF. THERE ARE MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LIEUTENANT BRANDON UP WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN NINETY SEVEN. OPTIMIST COULD TELL YOU SOME SOME REAL LIFE STORIES TOLD TO ME FROM DEPUTIES DOWN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I AND I STRESS THAT THESE ARE STE THE STORIES TOLD BY DOCTORS DIRECTLY TO ME BUT- YOU'RE GOING TO FIND- DID YOU THE SEATTLE FAMILIAR- MY FIRST STORY INVOLVED A MAN. WHO UPON BEING DETAINED BY DEPUTIES QUICKLY HELD UP A CALCULATOR IN ORDER TO PROVE HE TOOK THE TIME TO MAKE SURE ITEMS YOU JUST STOLEN NOT ADD UP TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. DOESN'T HEARING HE WOULD ONLY BE ISSUED A CITATION AND SENT ON HIS WAY AFTER SHORT BOOKING. MY SECOND STORY ABOUT AMANDA ENCOUNTERED CARRY NOT ONE. NOT TWO. BUT SIX CITATIONS IN HIS WALLET FOR PAST VIOLATIONS SHOPLIFTING. HE SO PROUDLY DISPLAYED THEM YOU WERE THOUGHT THEY WERE CERTIFICATES OF ACCOMPLISHMENT- NOT CITATIONS FOR BAD BEHAVIOR. AND PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST MORRISON FOR THINKING SHOPLIFTER STORED UP THESE SHE HAS NEVER MISSED A COURT DATE BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT ANY OF HER CITATIONS TO BECOME WARRANTS. I THINK THE COMMON ATTITUDE THE PEOPLE WE ARE ARRESTING SEEM TO SHARE IS THAT THE REWARD FOR THIS BEHAVIOR FAR OUTWEIGHS ANY RISK. AND BEING INCONVENIENCED BY CITATION IT'S JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. AND RESTORE THE MANY LIKE IT'S WE ENCOURAGE YOUR YES VOTE. ON THE AB FIFTEEN NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

THE PARKING CONFUSION FOR CORONA MONA OPT FOR. THE I- YOU HAVE THERE. IF YOU WISH. WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORT AND AT THIS TIME THANK YOU NOW TAKE WITH IN A IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS FRED WILLIAMS A CAL ACTION IN RESPECT OF OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WE KNOW THAT THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF THEFT MANY YEARS OF RESEARCH SHOW THAT AN INCREASE IN SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT DOES NOTHING TO DETER FUTURE OFFENSES. THEREFORE THIS BILL WILL STRETCH STATE RESOURCES WITH LITTLE BENEFIT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT ANY INCREASE IN PUNISHMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF LOW LEVEL CRIME IS GOING TO FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON BLACK PEOPLE PEOPLE OF COLOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN OVER PLEASE COMMUNITIES AND THOSE WHO THEMSELVES ARE OVER POLICED. THIS BILL WILL HAVE DAMAGING IMPACTS LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE FACING OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS FROM A SOMETIMES OF TO SHOPLIFTING OR TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN MEANINGFUL STEPS TO MOVE TOWARD LESS PUNITIVE MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE HUMANE CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY. WE KNOW WHAT WORKS TO PREVENT CRIMES. AND IT'S OUR VIEW THAT THE BEST WY TO PREVENT THAT IS TO OFFER REAL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND ROBERT BUSTS SOCIAL SERVICES TO ALL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND PROVIDE EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING IN SUPPORT OF REINTEGRATION. FOR THOSE WHO ARE RE ENTERING OUR COMMUNITIES. NOT CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR FELONY CONVICTIONS. AND LONG DISTANCES AND FOR THE REASON WE MUST. RESPECTFULLY ASKING ABOUT THANK. YOU THE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING I'M OFTEN ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY SENIOR ADVISER FOR CALIFORNIA FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE RETIRED CAPTAIN INGLEWOOD PD RETIRED DEPUTY CHIEF WAS SACKED PT RETIRED STATE DIRECTOR PAROLE. THE PROMISE OF PART PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS ORGANIZED UNDER IS PRETTY SIMPLE AND BASICALLY IT SAYS THAT WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO OF DIVERT PEOPLE FOR WELL THEY SOME THE LOWEST LEVEL CRIMES IN IN OUR MASSIVE PENAL CODE. LAW OUT OF OTHER STATE INSTITUTIONS SYSTEMINTO LOCAL FACILITIES WHEN THEY WERE- CONVICTED WE ALSO OF THE INTENDED AND THIS IS WORKED THAT A SERVICE FOR A PREDICTABLE FUNDING STREAM WOULD BE GENERATED TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN PROP FORTY SEVEN HAS DIVERTED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE COMMUNITIES OF OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE. FOR SERVICES FOR INTERVENTION- EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPORTANTLY SEVENTEEN TRAUMA CARE CENTERS FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAPPEN IT'S BEEN PREDOMINATELY- A RESOUNDING SUCCESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GETS OVERLOOKED I THINK AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROP FRTY SEVEN IS BENEFITS AND- AND- IS IT ALLEGED WEAKNESSES. THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THEIR FELONY CONVICTION REDUCED BY THE COURT OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS TO A MISDEMEANOR THAT'S HUGE IF YOU'VE EVER TALKED TO ANYBODY THAT HAS LIVED A LIFETIME AS A CONVICTED FELON. AND HAD THAT BURDEN TAKEN OFF THEM IT IS LIFE CHANGING LIFE CHANGING FOR ALL OF US TO BECAUSE IT IMPROVES OUR OPPORTUNITY FOR HOUSING. EDUCATION AND OTHER SYSTEMS. WE ALSO AFTER. THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A BILL THAT SAYS. WE'VE ARRESTED SOMEBODY AND CONVICTED THEM AND SYMPTOMS IN THREE TIMES. AND WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME BEEN ON PROBATION THREE TIMES AND THAT DIDN'T. ALTER THEIR BEHAVIOR SOMETHING WRONG THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG THERE AND WHAT ABOUT GOING INTO THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM. WOULD ANYBODY THINK IS GENERALLY SPEAKING A GOOD OUTCOME. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US BELIEVE THAT PUT ASIDE THE FACT THAT ALSO PUTS US ON A DIRECT COLLISION COURSE. WITH THE FEDERAL MANDATE ABOUT POPULATIONS INSIDE OUR GATES AND- IT ALSO COMPROMISES THE CAPACITY TO RETURN MONEY TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID IN THE OF A COMMITTEE MEETING THE LAST WEEK OR WEEKS IS STILL IN MY MIND REALLY RELEVANT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS I THINK MISPLACED. REVERENCE FOR THE UTILITY OF ARREST AND CONVICTION AND INCARCERATION AS THE CENTER STONE PIECE OF PUBLIC POLICY TO. ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN PUBLIC SAFETY I HOPE THEY WERE ALL UNDERSTANDING THAT IN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CRIMES AND FORTY SEVEN. AROUND EIGHT POINT 5% OF THE REPORTED CRIMES 50% OR NOT REPORTED OF THE REPORTED CRIMES ARE EVER SOLVED. BY THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE REST OF THE SUSPECT. SAN FRANCISCO PD JUST PUT OUT THEIR STATS FOR LAST YEAR THREE POINT 67% HOW CAN IT POSSIBLY BE LOGICAL AND MEANINGFUL. BETTER FILL YOUR RATE OF NINETY FIVE PERCENT. SITS AT THE WHEEL AT THE CENTER OF WHAT MAKES US SAFE. IT DOESN'T WHAT MAKES A SAVE I BELIEVE. AND LET ME SAY THE QUICK AND THE PRO EXPERIENCE WE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT THIS AT THIS POINT MY LIFE. IT MAKES A SAVE. IS ADDRESSING THE CAUSATIVE FACTORS OF CRIME. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE. PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS THE FIRST STEP IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT. IN IN A- DIRECTED AWAY. WHAT IF WE DID THAT TO SCALE. AND SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND OTHERS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I THINK WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR NAME AN ORGANIZATION. SERIK ME ON BEHALF OF INITIATE JUSTICE AND UP IN STRONG SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING NUMBER MY NAME IS RAJ BROWN AND I AM CALLING IN STRONG OPPOSITION AB ONE FIVE NINE SEVEN ON BEHALF OF THE ANTI. COALITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO MORE OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS CONCERNS. HE DOESN'T. DO YOU WANT TO MAKE COMMENT MISTER LUCKY YES I DO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR COMMENT RIGHT NOW I'M LOOKING FOR THE SUPPORT OF MY COMMENT YET- THE QUESTION TO A MISS WALDRON. ARE YOU AWARE THAT THE LOS ANGELES TIMES COSPONSORED A POLL WITH UC BERKELEY WHICH REVEALED THAT 59% AGREED WITH THE PROPOSAL IN YOUR BILL AND I'LL- READ THE QUOTE FROM THAT THE PAPER. THE BALLOT MEASURE RAISE THE THRESHOLD. FOR THE VALUE OF GOODS STOLEN TO TRIGGER FELONY FROM FOUR HUNDRED. TO NINE FIFTY AND RECLASSIFIED SOME OFFENSES AS MISDEMEANORS 59% OF THE SURVEY. SAID THAT THEY WOULD SUPPORT. AMENDING PROP FORTY SEVEN TO LET CERTAIN PROPERTY CRIMES BE PROSECUTED AS FELONIES WHILE ONLY 30% FAVORED LEAVING THE LAN CHANGED. I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE HAPPENING IN OUR RETAIL CENTERS AND TO THINK THAT PROP FORTY SEVEN CHANGING THE CONSEQUENCES HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT IS- KIDDING OURSELVES SO I- DID YOU FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AT THIS TIME. TO GIVE MISTER SMITH WHO PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME KIND OF LINES HERE I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE OPPOSITION EXCEPT FOR WE WENT FROM A FELONY TO A MISDEMEANOR PROP FORTY SEVEN AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH BACK WITH ALL THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON. THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCES. THEY DO IT EVERY DAY. AND UNTIL THE BUSINESSES THE RETAIL CENTERS ARE STARSTRUCK CLOSE IN OUR SEVEN ELEVENS RITE AID'S IN WALGREENS IN SAN FRANCISCO CLOSED ALL THEIR STORES. SO PEOPLE OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE NO WHERE TO GET THEIR LOCAL GOODS. WE HAVE TO START DOING SOMETHING IF THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN A MISDEMEANOR AND A FELONY BUT THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND I WILL MOVE THE BILL BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING VERY FAR TODAY. SO YEAH YEAH. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS. YES MISS WEBER. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY AND FOR TRYING TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID THAT REALLY KIND OF. YOU KNOW MADE ME PERK UP AND LISTEN IS THAT- THESE PEOPLE NEED. TO GET HELP- THAT THEY NEED TO GET THE HELP THAT IS NEEDED. AND I AGREE WITH THAT- I THINK UNFORTUNATELY- WE DIFFER ON HOW TO GET THAT HELD- I'M A DATA DRIVEN PERSON. AS A SCIENTIST AND WHAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IS THAT LOCKING PEOPLE UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN- EXTENDING THEIR SENTENCES DOES NOT REDUCE THEIR CHANCES OF DOING IT AND SO- I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO GET WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING- I DON'T THINK THAT. THIS BILL AS IS. I WOULD PRODUCE THOSE RESULTS BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH ANYONE ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE- OUR SYSTEM I DO BELIEVE SOME OF THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE BY THE FUNDING FROM PROPERTY SEVEN. ARE DOING THAT- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO GET US TO THAT POINT. I THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD URGE RESPECTFULLY FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND- AND I KNOW YOUR HEARTS IN A MINUTE IN THE RIGHT PLACE BECAUSE WE WORKED TOGETHER ON SEVERAL BILLS- FORTUNATELY THIS ONE. DOESN'T GET THERE AND THAT SAME LA TIMES. ALSO WROTE THAT THIS WASN'T THE WAY ON THE THREE. PROP FORTY SEVEN BILLS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH. A FACT THEY WROTE IT NOT SO FLATTERING. EDITORIAL ABOUT IT BUT- I THINK. YOUR MAY BE WONDER WHAT WE COULD WORK WITH TO ACTUALLY GET TO A BETTER PLACE AS- DR WEBER SAYS WE NEEDED WE NEED TO COME OUT OF SOLUTION- UNFORTUNATELY. DURING THE BABY OUT WOULD HELP THE BATHWATER HIS IT'S NOT TO HUESO WILL HAVE TO RECOMMEND A NO VOTE BY SEPTEMBER WALDRON THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY AT A GUY LACKEY I BONTA. FONTANELLE BRIAN. BRIAN NO WEBER. WEBER NOTES SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO KNOWS. SMITH I. SORRY THE MEASURE DOESN'T PASS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE I ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION AND WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE AND ALSO LOOK AT THE CAUSES OF WHAT'S GOING ON THANK YOU THANK YOU AND IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION WE WILL GRANT THIS BILL RECONSIDERATION BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT. IN OUR LAST. ONE FOR TODAY MR WARD. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BE GET. YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG HEARING YOU HAD TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE- FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THEPROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AB NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS DIVERSIFYING THE COUNTY GRAND JURY. GRAND JURIES IN CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CONSTITUENCIES THEY SERVE GRAND JURIES YOU KNOW HAVE THE POWER TO ACT AS A WATCHDOG FOR SOME OF OUR MOST CONSEQUENTIAL LOCAL AGENCIES AND OFFICIALS HOWEVER WHEN THE MAKE UP OF THOSE GRAND JURIES DO NOT REFLECT THE CONSTITUENCIES PROPER REPRESENTATION OF THESE COMMUNITIES IS VALUE AND PRIORITIES IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY THE TIME-COMMITMENT AND LOW COMPENSATION RATE FOR GRAND JURY SERVICE EFFECTIVELY BAR MOST CALIFORNIANS FROM SERVING ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM DISADVANTAGED IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES UNDER CURRENT LAW PER DIEM COMPENSATION IS CAPPED AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER DAY NOT PER HOUR SERVICE UNLESS A HIGHER FEE IS PROVIDED BY SATUTE OR COUNTY OR CITY ORDINANCE THIS RATES NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE MAKING THE SERVICES SENSUALLY VOLUNTARY. SO TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND WHY IN THE POOL OF POTENTIAL GRAND JURORS AB NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO MAKES THREE CHANGES TO THE GRAND JURY SELECTION PROCESS FIRST IT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC DATA TO BE COLLECTED DURING THE COUNTY GRAND JURY SELECTION PROCESS FOR THE PURPOSES OF YEARLY REPORTS RELEASED BY THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL COUNCIL. SECOND IT WOULD RAISE THE PER DIEM RATE FOR GRAND JURORS TO MAKE THE SERVICE A MORE VIABLE OPTION FOR LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND THIRD IT WOULD PROVIDE EDUCATION TO POTENTIAL JURORS BY INCLUDING INFORMATION ON HOW TO BECOME A GRAND JUROR IN THE EXISTING TRIAL JURY SUMMONSES THAT WE ALL GET IN THE MAIL. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO RECOGNIZES THE INFLUENCE OF GRAND JURIES ON THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND MAKES NECESSARY CHANGES AIM TO INCREASE THE REPRESENTATION OF LOW INCOME HISTORICALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST COMMUNITIES FOR THESE REASONS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTES AND ON THE PHONE LINES TODAY WE HAVE CYNTHIA CASTILLO FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LONG HI. AND HUGHES FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION TO PROVIDE WITNESS TESTIMONY THANK YOU. EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR. OPEN UP THE LINE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEERING MEMBERS MY NAME IS TO PICK UP BEYOND THE POLICY ADVOCATE WITH WESTERN CENTER ON MOM PROPERTY WESTERN CENTER THE STATE'S LARGEST AND OLDEST SUPPORT CENTER WITH THE GOAL OF ENDING POVERTY THROUGH THE LINE ECONOMIC AND RACIAL JUSTICE. WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT I BIRTH OCCASION OF GRAND JURIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT THERE WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE'S POPULATION A KEY COMPONENT OF THAT IS ALSO ENSURING THAT JURORS ARE FAIRLY COMPENSATED WITH THE END GOAL OF MAKING GRAND JURY DUTY ACCEPTABLE. FOR CALIFORNIANS TO LOW INCOME. WHEN A GRAND JURY THAT. BY EVERYDAY HEALTH. WHO THEIR TIME TO. AND ENSURE THAT THEIR LOW GOVERNMENT INTEREST. AND SHARED COMMUNITY. GRAND JURY PERFORMED PRIMARY ROLE WANTED TO. THE BILL OF CHARGES BEING PROCESS BY APART. AND YET DURING AGENCIES AN OFFICIAL. IN THE LATTER FUND. GRANT BACK OF THE CAR. WATCH TO ESSENTIAL. DEPARTMENTS BUT THIS YEAR DEPARTMENT AND- FACILITY. TO INSTITUTIONS THAT HISTORICALLY INVOLVED THE DETENTION AND PROSECUTION OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. ADDITIONALLY THEY'LL RECEIVE ISSUING A CRIMINAL INDICTMENT AND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF PUBLIC CORRUPTION. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA DEEP RACIAL DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND INCOME AND WEALTH. HAVE RESULTED IN A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR JESTERDIGITAL DUTY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORK RIGHTLY HIGHLIGHTED THE FIFTY DOLLAR PER DIEM RATE IS PROHIBITED MANY CALIFORNIANS UNABLE TO INCREASE A LOT WAGES. FOR THIRD. CURRENT DATA THAT GRAND JURIES ARE. MADE UP OF WHITE INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN TO TAKE THE TIME OFF. IN DEMOCRATIC COUNT BIRTHDAY 70% OF. FOR TWENTY TWENTY GRAND JURY. AS WHITE WITH ONLY ONE PERSON I DON'T AT THE- BY THE COUNTY THE WHITE HISPANIC OR LATINO. BEING DISCUSS. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY TWO REQUIRE YOUR SIX ARRAY THE PARTY RATE FOR GRAND JURY AND- HIM GRAPHIC DAY. TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CAL. THE CHANGE ARE NECESSARY FOR A RACIAL. EQUITY TRUTH. JERRY PLAY CRITICAL IN THE CAL INVOLVED IN THE LEAGUE SYSTEM SUPPORT. PEOPLE OF COLOR THOSE LIVING POVERTY ARE OVER. AND I AND REPRESENT DURING THE BILL PUBLISHED IN. IN OUR COURTS CHANGES. BODY BLACK. AND WE- URGE AND I. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COME- ON HOPING YOU CAN HEAR ME YES MY NAME IS LAST WEEK. THANK YOU MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL HUGHES I'M A REPRESENT OF CAL DEFENDER OF SOLANO COUNTY. I CURRENTLY SERVE ON THE SOLANO COUNTY CIVIL GRAND JURY THIS IS MY SECOND AND LAST YEAR ON THE CIVIL GRAND JURY AND I'M HAPPY TO OFFER THIS TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. THERE ARE USUALLY IN THE COUNTY TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES THE CRIMINAL GRAND JURY AND THE CIVIL GRAND JURY- OFTEN THEY GET CONFLATED. THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT JOBS A REPRESENTATION OF THE DIVERSITY OF ANY COUNTY AND OR JURY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS IN OUR SYSTEM. OF COURT AND THE GOVERNMENT. SUCH A REFLECTION LEADS MORE FAITH IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE WORK BEING DONE FOR THEM IN THEIR NAME THIS BILL DOES TWO IMPORTANT THINGS THAT ENSURES THAT A REASONABLE FEE IS PAID FOR THE WORK OF THE GRAND JURORS. AND IT WORKS TO REQUIRE THE GRAND JURY MEMBERSHIP REFLECTS THE DEMO DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE CANYON WHICH IT SERVES. BECAUSE GRAND JURY WORKS PAYS SUCH A SMALL THE PER DIEM AND LET ME. SAY THAT FOR MY EIGHTY HOURS OF WORK LAST MONTH ON THE U. CIVIL GRAND JURY I RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS FOR MILEAGE AND MY EIGHTY HOURS OF WORK- I'M LUCKY I HAVE A PENSION. THIS THAT LIMITS THE GRAND JURY TO A DEMOGRAPHIC OF PERSONS THAT CAN AFFORD TO SERVE PARTICULARLY ON A GRAND JURY BUT ALSO ON A CRIMINAL GRAND JURY HOWEVER ON A CRIMINAL GRAND JURY THE PEOPLE AT LEAST HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY IN MOST COUNTIES TO LET THE COURT KNOW WHAT CERTAIN THAT THE SERVICE CAN CAUSE GREAT FOR FINANCIAL HARM. WELL CRIMINAL GRAND JURIES ARE OFTEN SUMMONED BY THE COURTS TO SEVERAL GRAND JURIES ARE MADE UP OF VOLUNTEERS IN MY COUNTY WHICH IS VERY DIVERSE AND IN FACT HAS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY VALLEJO ONE QUARTER ASIAN ONE QUARTER AFRICAN AMERICAN ONE QUARTER LAST YEAR NEXT. AND ONE QUARTER CUT CAUCASIAN OUR GRAND JURY OF NINETEEN PEOPLE AS ONLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. YOU REQUIRE EFFORTS TO BALANCE THE DEMOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY IS A VERY POSITIVE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION REGARDING OUR GRAND JURY. IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO FAILED TO PASS THIS BILL BECAUSE OF CUTS- NURSING COMMUNITY SUPPORT IN OUR SYSTEM IS PRICELESS THANK YOU THANK YOU.
