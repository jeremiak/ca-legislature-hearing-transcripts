REGARDING BACKLOG THERE WE DID

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:25.324

THERE IS ALSO -- WE HAD A GOOD --

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.365
I WILL CALL IT A DEBATE BUT THE

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.534
DISCUSSION AROUND HOW WE

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.737
OPTIMIZE -- I THINK -- FIVE

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.472
EIGHT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE AS

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.807
A WHOLE.

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:44.343
IS VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.713
THAT OUR WERE.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.748
APPS PROGRAM WHICH IS OUR ARMS

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:51.517
PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST IS.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:54.153
REALLY ENFORCED AND SO WE HAD A

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.588
GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW DO WE

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:58.324
ACHIEVE THAT FULL ENFORCEMENT.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:00.426
AND WE IN THAT DISCUSSION

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:04.464
RECOGNIZED THAT WELL WE HAVE A

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.499
GREAT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.601
LIVE IT LEGITIMATE LEAD BECAUSE

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:11.003
IT'S A STATEWIDE AGENCY IT HAS

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.242
PRESENTS OUR OFFICES IN OUR THE

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.276
THE NUMBER OF BOXES IN THE

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:19.545
PRESENCE ACROSS STATE IS LIMITED.

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:22.615
AND SO THE ABILITY FOR THE

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:23.983
OFFICERS WHO ARE IN THAT

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.385

IT'S PUT TAXES THEM.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.527
AND SO THERE WAS DISCUSSION THAT

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:38.197
ALREADY IT IS IN OUR CODE THAT --

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:39.832
THAT OUR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.168
AGENCIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.470
ENFORCE APPS ADDITIONALLY.

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:46.439
AND OF COURSE WE ALWAYS WANT TO

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:47.807
ENSURE AND WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.175
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT THEIR

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.010

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:13.699
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:16.035
BUT THE FEELING WAS THAT IF OUR

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.404
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.139

YOUR YOUR BOSS IS NEW TO A THE%

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:10.803
ROLE OF A DEPARTMENT HEAD WHICH

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.672
IS UNDERSTANDABLE -- BUT I'VE

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.274
BEEN A DEPARTMENT HEAD SO I CAN

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.375
APPRECIATE ALL THE FUN.

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:18.077
WHEN YOU STEP INTO SOMETHING A

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:18.944
LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN BEING A

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:20.012
LEGISLATOR NOW YOU'RE AN

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:22.748

BUDGET WISE HE NEEDS HELP

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:27.286
STAFFING WISE YOU CERTAINLY

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:28.621
COULD WORK A LITTLE MORE WITH HR.

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.623
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.024
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:34.560
OPERATING THE A. P. P. S. ARE

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:36.896
COMPENSATED.

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:39.865
APPROPRIATELY AND I THINK THAT I

00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:41.667
KNOW THAT'S A BUDGET.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:42.301
TERRY KIND OF THING THAT'S MORE

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:42.968
ABOUT [inaudible]

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:44.737
MINISTERIAL OPPORTUNITY.

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.739
AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS IT

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:48.707
CONCERNS AS WELL SO ON AND NONE

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:49.275
OF THOSE WERE DRESSED IN THE

00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:50.176
STAFF [inaudible]

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.243
RECOMMENDATION [inaudible]

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.579
SO.

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.314
I WILL BE OPPOSED.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.951
BUT MY CONCERN IS IS THAT WE GET

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:00.953
THESE FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.655
OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOULD NOT

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:04.190
BE HAVING THEM.

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:05.291
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT MAY BE

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:07.093
MENTALLY ILL.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.060
AND WE CERTAINLY HAD THE

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:09.562
BORDERLINE.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.330
INCIDENT THOUSAND OAKS IN

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:14.100
NOVEMBER YOU KNOW SEEM DESERVE

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:16.435
SOMEONE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN.

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:19.138
POSSESSING FIREARMS SO I THOUGHT

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:20.773
MAN I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW IF IF

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.841
IF I'M ACTION A QUESTION I'M

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.442
MAKING A STATEMENT ON ON ON

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.411
HIGHER I RESPECT YOUR PROPOSAL

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.012
BUT I DISAGREE.

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:28.948

YOUR OPINIONS ON THIS MATTER --

I THINK WE'RE ALL AFTER THE SAME

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:52.037
GOAL HERE AND THAT IS TO HAVE

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:53.706
FIREARMS REMOVED FROM THE

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.508
POSSESSION OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:56.775
PROHIBITED AND THAT IS THE MAIN

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:59.044
FOCUS OF OUR APPS PROGRAM ON THE

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.447
ENFORCEMENT SIDE -- IT'S A VERY

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.249
COMPLEX SYSTEM AS YOU ALL ARE

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:04.150
AWARE.

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.918
AND THE NUMBERS JUST CONTINUE TO

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.920
GROW EVEN THOUGH WE CONTINUE TO

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:10.055
CHIP AWAY AT THOSE NUMBERS BUT

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:12.358
SOME SOME IMPORTANT NUMBERS TO

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.360
TO NOTE AND THEY WERE IN THE

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.761
ANNUAL REPORT.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.863
WERE WE WENT FROM IN TWO

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.932
THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN AND ONE

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:21.467
POINT FOUR MILLION KNOWN ARMED

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.802
INDIVIDUALS TO NOW TWO POINT

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:24.436
FIVE MILLION MORE THAN TWO POINT

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:28.040
FIVE MILLION -- ANOTHER EXAMPLE

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:29.742
OF US WORKING WITH LOCAL LAW

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:30.709
ENFORCEMENT.

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:33.045
LOS ANGELES COUNTY IT HAS THE

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.680
HIGHEST NUMBER OF ARMS AND

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:36.015
PROHIBITED PEOPLE.

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:37.516
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.151
THIRTEEN WE HAD OVER SIX

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:41.987
THOUSAND ACTIVE ARMED FOLKS --

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:42.488
AND PROHIBITED FOLKS IN

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:47.693
ACCOUNTING WE CURRENTLY HAVE --

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.460
ONE I WANT I WANT TO SAY IT'S

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.062
FIFTEEN HUNDRED ROUGHLY.

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:50.629
FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND WE ARE

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.298
WORKING WITH LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:53.799
DEPARTMENT ON A DAILY BASIS

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.267
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM TO

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:56.702
NINE MONTHS STRAIGHT.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.170
SO YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS ARE

00:13:58.237 --> 00:13:59.405
COMING DOWN BUT IT'S A SLOW AND

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:01.674
GRADUAL PROCESS BECAUSE AGAIN AS

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.308
WE TALKED BEFORE AND IT'S IN THE

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:03.375
REPORT.

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:05.277
IS ROUGHLY A THOUSAND NEW

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.513
PROHIBITED PERSONS ARE ADDED TO

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.181
THAT LIST SO EVEN THOUGH WERE

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:10.816
ATTACKING IT WE'RE DOING THE

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:13.319
BEST WE CAN WE'RE BEING SAFE --

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.421
WAR WAR REDUCING THOSE NUMBERS

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:17.957
BY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TO SEVEN

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:18.357
HUNDRED A MONTH.

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:19.992
SO WERE WERE TRYING TO PLAY

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.060
CATCH UP BAY AND THE AND THAT'S

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:22.494
AGAIN WHY WE HAVE THE BUDGET

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.230
CHANGE PROPOSAL THERE. FOR THIS

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:26.165
THE STAFFING AND THE FUNDING AND

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.366
A LOT OF THESE POSITIONS ARE

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:30.135
POSITIONS THAT WE DID HAVE AFTER

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:30.769
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BUT THEY

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:31.737
WENT AWAY.

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:33.205
AFTER THE FUNDING SO WE'RE

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:34.440
HAVING A HARDER AND HARDER TIME

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.308
KEEPING UP WITH THE NUMBERS THAT

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.376
WE USED TO JUST A COUPLE OF

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.545
YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF THAT AS

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:42.214
WELL -- IT'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:43.749
PROGRAM IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:45.117
PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:47.253

THAT WAY -- WEEK WE ARE DOING

THE BEST WE CAN WITH THE

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.192
RESOURCES WE HAVE THERE'S A LOT

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.828
OF FOLKS WORKING -- OVERTIME AND

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:57.396
ON WEEKENDS TO TRYING CONTINUE

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.731
TO PUT THE NUMBERS UP.

00:14:58.797 --> 00:14:59.999
BETTER EXPECTED.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.600
IT'S JUST BECOMING MORE MORE

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.769
CHALLENGING AND I THINK IT'S A

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.304
WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT I

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:06.438
APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S REVIEW

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:09.041

DO WORK WITH THE LOCAL LAW

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.677
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE WOULD

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:14.013
LOVE TO WORK WITH THEM EVEN MORE

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:14.380
SO.

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:16.148
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.450
ARE -- ENTERTAINING THAT WOULD

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:19.451
HELP THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:21.987
FANTASTIC -- BUT EVEN WITH US

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:23.522
WORKING WITH THE LOCALS THE

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:26.558

JUSTIFICATION RBC P. STANDS IT'S

00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:34.266
IT'S REALLY BEEN A MATTER OF

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.668
TRYING TO HELP YOU GUYS

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.169

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:38.971
EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING THROUGH

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.072
AND HOPEFULLY IT MAKES SENSE --

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.173
BUT IT IS A VERY WORTHWHILE

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.741
IMPORTANT PROGRAM IT IS VERY

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:44.977
SUCCESSFUL MAYBE JUST NOT TO THE

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:47.246
EXPEDIENCY THAT WE ALL WANT BUT

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:51.984
IT'S THE IT'S THE UP HILL BATTLE

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:52.251
THAT WERE.

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.686
WERE FACING.

WELL I DID NOT BRING THE REPORT

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.056
THAT YOU HAD DONE.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:59.358
YOUR YOUR DRESSING THE NUMBER OF

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:01.627
NEW REQUEST COMING IN EVERY YEAR

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:02.728
BUT WE'RE STILL AT WHAT.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:03.329
TEN THOUSAND ROUGHLY THAT WE

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:03.562
STILL.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.564
HAVEN'T TO TO TRY AND DRILL THAT

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.398
DOWN YES SIR OF AN A AND IF I

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.599
CAN ADDRESS THAT AND IT'S IN THE

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.401
REPORT AS WELL WE TRIED TO BE

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.337
MORE SPECIFIC IN CLARIFYING WHAT

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:11.837
THAT.

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:14.073
BACKLOG WAS SO THAT IT WAS NOT

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.041
JUST THE RECURRING NUMBER OF

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.343
CASES THAT WERE WORKING AS FAR

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:18.444
AS A BACK WHAT WE WANTED TO

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.678
CLARIFY.

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.181
THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:24.249
THIRTEEN THERE WERE TWENTY

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:24.783
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.452
TWENTY ONE ACTIVE.

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:28.320
CASES THAT HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:29.488
BOWS OF ALL BEEN WORKS NOW THAT

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:32.057
SO THAT ORIGINAL BACKLOG IS NOW

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:35.194
GONE SO THE THE CURRENCY NINE

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:35.861
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED CASES THAT

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:39.965
WE HAD JANUARY FIRST OF TWO

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:40.532
THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT'S OUR

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:41.200
CURRENT ACTIVE NUMBER BUT THOSE

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.968
ARE ALL NEW CASES THAT HAVE.

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:43.702
DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:46.472
OF YEARS -- AND AND CONTINUALLY

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:48.474
GETTING ADDED SO AGAIN I THINK

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.275
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUCCESS FROM

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.911
THAT ASPECT IT IS SUCCESSFUL.

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:54.279
AND ANOTHER THING NOTED IN THE

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.548
REPORT IS THAT IN THE LAST FIVE

00:16:56.615 --> 00:16:57.383
YEARS.

00:16:57.449 --> 00:17:00.319
THERE HAVE BEEN. FIFTY SIX

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.454
THOUSAND NEW PEOPLE ADDED TO THE

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:05.858
ARMS AND PROHIBITED FILE WE HAVE

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:07.760
REMOVED.

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:08.394
FIFTY THREE THOUSAND WE'RE STILL

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:08.927
BEHIND THAT NUMBER THAT

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.630
CONTINUES TO INCREASE -- SO I

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.265
HOPE THAT BETTER EXPLAINS THE

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.501
THE BACKLOG THAT'S GREAT I OKAY

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:18.404
I'M HERE TO SUPPORT YOU OKAY --

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.875
I THINK THE AG HAS [inaudible]

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.977
ONE AREA OF EXPOSURE THAT'S A

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:26.011
LITTLE FRUSTRATING IN THAT IS.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:28.714
IF SOMEONE.

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.449
IN THAT LIST OF TEN THOUSAND

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.184
WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS.

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:34.086
ACTUALLY MURDER SOMEBODY.

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:34.853
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET THAT

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.023
FIREARM -- IT IS THAT IS A

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.125
LITTLE TOO DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.294
TO THE FAMILY.

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:43.128
AND IT'S WE'VE HAD ANOTHER

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:44.963
INCIDENT POWER AWAY THIS PAST

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.032
WEEKEND I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:47.566
INDIVIDUAL WAS ON THE LIST

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:47.866
[inaudible]

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:51.970
BUT I WANTED TO HELP AS MUCH AS

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:53.472
I CAN AS RECENTLY AS I CAN.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:55.474
AND IF YOU COULD CONVINCE

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:59.378
SENATOR BELL. TO ALSO POSES THAT

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:02.915
WOULD MAKE THIS A VERY FINE.

00:18:02.981 --> 00:18:06.452
IF I MAKE COMMENTS -- EVERY.

TELL YOU AS BEING THE DIRECTOR

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.289
OF THE BUREAU FIREARMS ANYTIME

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:12.324
THERE IS A SHOOTING IN THE STATE

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:14.526
OF CALIFORNIA -- ESPECIALLY IF

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:17.463
IT INVOLVES A DEATH OF SOMEBODY.

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.931
I SEE THAT IMMEDIATELY I SEE

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:20.899
THAT ON THE NEWS MY PHONE IS

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.701
GOING OFF PHONE CALLS COMING IN

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.203
EMAILS COMING IN.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.671
AND USUALLY THE FIRST RESPONSES

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:26.805
OF THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.407
ARE IS THAT SOMEBODY WE KNEW

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:29.708
ABOUT IS THAT PERSON ON THE APPS

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.977
LIST IF SO HOW COME WE DIDN'T

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:32.611
KNOW ABOUT AND WHEN DID WE LAST

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:33.779
VISIT THEM.

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:35.380
AND I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU IT

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:39.451
IT IT IT'S 95% IF NOT HIGHER.

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:40.419
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE INCIDENTS

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:41.553
THAT HAPPENED ARE NOT

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.922
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON ALL OUR

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:45.390
ARMED AND PROHIBITED LIST.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.192
AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ARM

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:48.527
FOR A BIT OF LIST THOSE ARE

00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:49.828
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE KNOWN.

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.630
ARMED INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.365
AND THEY BECOME PROHIBITED.

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.399
A LOT OF THESE INCIDENTS THAT

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:56.735
OCCUR ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE FARMS

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.237
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

00:18:58.303 --> 00:18:59.605
AND THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.473
HITTING OUR RADAR.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.141
BUT A YOU KNOW A IT'S NOT A GOOD

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:04.977
THING BUT IT GIVES ME PEACE AT

00:19:05.043 --> 00:19:06.645
LEAST FOR MY JOB AS A MANAGER

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:07.746
OVER THAT PROGRAM.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.548
THAT THAT PERSON THAT COMMITTED

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:14.119
THIS HIDEOUS OF AND IS NOT

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:16.388
SOMEBODY THAT WE HAVE MISSED --

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:17.222
SO I CAN SAY THAT THAT THAT

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.290
THAT'S MORE THE COMMONALITY OF

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.025
WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE INSTANCES

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.027
THANK YOU FOR YOUR GUESTS WERE.

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:22.594
PRECIADO THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:23.595
MISTER RIGHT THANK YOU JUST A

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:24.763
QUICK QUESTION AND I AND I

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.031
NOTICED THE RECOMMENDATION IS --

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:26.765
TO REJECT THE GENERAL FUND

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.467
PROPOSAL AND AND THE LAST

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:29.902
HEARING WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THE

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:31.403
REQUIREMENT -- OF WHAT FUND

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.538
SOURCE WOULD COVER THIS PROGRAM

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:33.939
IN THE FUTURE RIGHT -- SO I

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.240
WANTED TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.842
ON WHAT THE ACTION INCLUDES AS

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:40.812
AS A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:45.517
DRESS -- I APPRECIATE THE ISSUES

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:47.886
THAT YOU HAVE STAFF OF REASON

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:50.422
ALSO WHAT MY FIRST HERE'S RAISED

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:50.722
[inaudible]

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:55.794
AND IN OUR DISCUSSION WHEN EIJI

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.663
WAS HERE.

00:19:57.729 --> 00:19:59.565
AND IN THE B. C. P. IT SHOWS

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:01.833
THAT WHAT'S BEING ASKED FOR IS

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.402
GENERAL FUND VERSUS THE SPECIAL

00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:05.571
FUND AND PARTLY IS BECAUSE WE

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:06.872
ARE.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.640
SO VERY COMMONLY THIS ONE OF

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.509
THESE THINGS WHERE AT LEAST THIS

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.411
IS MORE TRANSPARENT AND ITS

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:13.879
TECHNOLOGY.

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:16.448
THAT ARE SPECIAL FUND BALANCE IS

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.283
GOING DOWN IN WHICH IT IS

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.688
INADEQUATE. TO AT LEAST IN TERMS

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:25.958
OF HOW THE AG FEELS THAT HOW THE

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:27.926
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FEELS THAT.

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:30.662
THIS -- WORK SHOULD BE STAFFED

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:32.364
IT'S IN ADEQUATE COVERAGE.

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.833
SO IT'S THAN ASKING ON THE

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.168
GENERAL FUND SO [inaudible]

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:40.706
PART OF THE IT'S NOT ARTICULATED

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:43.642
IN THE STAFF ITEM BUT PART OF

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.077
THE MOTIVATION IS.

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:47.212
WHAT WE NEED TO DO? TO LOOK AT

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:50.716
HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE IF

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:54.786
WE EXPECTED THAT OUR ENFORCEMENT.

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:57.522
OF OUR RULES AROUND APPS WOULD

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.424
BE FUNDED.

00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:01.493
BY A SPECIAL FIND.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.729
HOW HOW CAN WE?

00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:05.964
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO?

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.866
THE FIRST IT KNOWLEDGE THAT IT

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.868
MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE AND WHAT WE

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.436
NEED TO DO TO ADJUST IT.

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:15.173
AND RATHER THAN.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.109
WE MAY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:18.644
TO GENERAL FUND BUT RATHER THAN

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.446
JUST JUMPING TO GENERAL FUND.

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:22.514
WHICH OF COURSE IS WE ALL KNOW

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:24.650
HAS.

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:27.052
THE MOST COST PRESSURES.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.387
SO PART OF IT WAS JUST SORT OF

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.722
PUT IT BACK IN.

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.224
YOU KNOW HOW WE GOING TO TO TO

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.059
DOJ THAT.

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:36.028
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO ACCOMPLISH

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:38.930
THE FULL ENFORCEMENT?

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:40.465
AND BRING BACK TO US IN THAT

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:44.069
REPORT HOW TO DO THAT WITHIN.

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:46.071
THE SPECIAL FIND AND IF IT'S

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.006
IMPOSSIBLE TEND TO BE UP FRONT

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:49.508
NOTE IN A WAY.

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:50.509
YOU ARE AFRAID BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:52.177
SAYING YOU NEED GENERAL FUND BUT

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:53.745
THERE'S NOT A REAL.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.647
DISCUSSION AS TO WHY.

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:57.482
ADDITIONALLY SO IN JUST

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:59.251
HISTORICALLY.

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:00.752
THE DEPARTMENT WAS GIVEN

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.354
TEMPORARY FUNDING IN TEMPORARY

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:04.056
POSITIONS FOR THEIR BACKLOG

00:22:04.122 --> 00:22:05.490
STARTING IN [inaudible]

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:09.027
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THAT FINDING

00:22:09.094 --> 00:22:12.164
RAN OUT OR EXPIRED AS OF APRIL

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.666
OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THERE WAS

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.334
A LOT OF GOOD WORK DONE.

00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:18.770
IN THE BACKLOG DID GET REDUCED.

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.338
BUT THERE WAS RECOGNITION AT

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:21.940
THAT TIME NOW I WAS NOT IN THE

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.642
LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:25.177
BUT THERE WAS RECORD RECOGNITION

00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:27.913
AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT.

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:30.382
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF NEW

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:32.117
PEOPLE ON APPS AND THE TYPE OF

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.518
WORKLOAD.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:35.554
IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO MAKE

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.790
THOSE POSITIONS PERMANENT SO

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.158
TWENTY TWO PERMANENT POSITIONS

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:41.460
WERE APPROVED.

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:43.729
IN DATA BUDGET YEAR AND THEY ARE

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.397
STILL THERE WE'RE NOT TOUCHING

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:47.132
THOSE THEIR CONTINUING.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.201
NOW IN THE REPORT THAT DOJ

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:51.103
PROVIDED US SOMETIME AGO IT

00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:52.504
SHOWED THAT.

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.573
THERE'S BEEN DIFFICULTY IN

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:56.308
RETENTION.

00:22:56.374 --> 00:22:58.744
AND THAT ALL OF THOSE POSITIONS

00:22:58.810 --> 00:22:59.878
ARE NOT FELT.

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:02.647
SO PART OF AT LEAST MY

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:04.282
MOTIVATION WAS ALL RIGHT IF

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:05.584
WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN PERMANENT

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.719
POSITIONS AND THEY'RE NOT FILLED.

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.421
WHY?

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:11.890
I DON'T QUITE A QUITE SAY WHY.

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:13.592
BUT IT'S HARDER TO JUSTIFY

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:15.560
GIVING MORE POSITIONS WHEN

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:17.629
THERE'S NO CLEAR DE THAT WE CAN

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:18.797
EVEN FILL THEM.

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:20.432
AND GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:22.534
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:25.170
HAS THE HAS THE ABILITY AND

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.272
WILLINGNESS THEN USING MORSE

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:28.640
PARTNERS THAT WAS PART OF THE

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:28.907
THINKING.

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:30.008
NOW.

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.710
I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO HOLD

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:33.779
THIS ITEM OPEN.

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:37.249
AND TO GIVE IT A RE LOOK. TO SEE

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:38.784
WHAT THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO MOVE

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.885
FORWARD.

00:23:39.951 --> 00:23:41.987
BUT AT LEAST.

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:43.622
WE'VE HEARD FROM MY VICE CHAIR

00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:45.891
ABOUT THE IT HIS PERSPECTIVE ON

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:47.192
IT AND YOU'VE HEARD.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.394
THAT AT LEAST IN MY THINKING IT

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:51.663
WAS TRYING TO GET AT HOW TO

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.731
REDUCE OUR GENERAL FUND COST

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.733
PRESSURES.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.269
AND AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:59.070
CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS KNOWING THAT

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:01.072
WE HAVE VACANCIES IN GIVING MORE

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:03.508
POSITIONS DOESN'T NECESSARILY.

00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:07.412
FILL THE F. T.'S SO.

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.047
BUT WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN.

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:09.981
SO THAT WE CAN GIVE SOME MORE

00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:13.251
THINKING TO THIS.

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:16.154
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER OKAY.

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:16.354
RIGHT.

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:22.227
YES SENATOR BREAUX.

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:24.262
I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS WITH THE

00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:25.063
STAFF.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.366
FOR LONGER THAN.

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:33.805
BOTH MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- I

00:24:33.872 --> 00:24:35.974
THINK THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WE

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:37.809
KEEP COMING IN AND ASKING FOR

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:40.512
MORE MONEY.

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:41.012
AND TO MAKE THE STAFF'S

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:42.781
PERMANENT.

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:44.282
IN MY BLOW AWAY PUT IN AS WE

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:45.617
DON'T GET ANY [inaudible]

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:47.485
RESULTS.

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:49.554
OR WE WE WE ARE TOLD WE'RE GOING

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:50.856
TO GET SOME RESULTS THAT WE

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:52.090
DON'T ACHIEVE THOSE.

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:54.492
SO SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IF

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.560
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD IT.

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:57.729
IS OKAY WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:59.831
ALLOCATE SOME MONEY HERE.

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:00.398
HOW WHAT KIND OF RESULTS WE

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:01.933
GOTTA GET?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.935
WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE FOR US

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:05.270
ARE HOW HOW IS THIS.

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.806
OF GOING TO ACTUALLY --

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:08.907
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING WHAT'S

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:10.408
PERFORMANCE.

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:11.376
WHAT PERFORMANCE YOU GONNA GIVE

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:13.144
AND I I DON'T I DON'T WANT JUST

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:13.645
A BUNCH OF?

00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:15.814
MADE UP STUFF I WON A REALITY

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.849
CHECK YOUR HOW MANY HOW MANY

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.484
VACANCIES YOU HAVE NOW ARE YOU

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:20.318
ARE YOU.

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:22.220
UNDERSTAFFED NOW ARE YOU NOT

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:23.788
PERFORMED BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:24.823
AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.627
PASSES WE GAVE MONEY FOR THIS.

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:30.362
THE THIS YOU WERE ABLE TO ROUTE

00:25:30.428 --> 00:25:32.163
TO HIRE PEOPLE YOU HAVE DELAYED

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.566
DELAYS AND SOME OF THE HIRING

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:36.635
AND SO WHEN WHEN THAT HAPPENED

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:37.669
THE DELAY HAPPEN.

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:39.170
YOU FOR YOU YOU FELL FURTHER

00:25:39.237 --> 00:25:41.473
BEHIND AND THE NUMBER STARTED

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:42.774
GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:44.276
BECAUSE THEY COME IN EVERY YEAR.

00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:45.577
HE STARTED FALLING BEHIND YOU

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:47.479
WERE KEEPING UP WITH THE WITH

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:50.982
THE THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS.

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:55.587
THAT SO SO LIKE IF IF -- IF WE

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:58.523
ALLOCATE MORE MONEY TO TO YOU.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.259
IS -- IT GOING TO HAVE A

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:02.627
SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT.

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:05.130
ON REDUCTION.

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:09.200
OF THE NUMBERS IF NOT.

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:12.103
I WANNA I WANNA I WANT HONEST

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.471
TRUTH SO I'M I'M LESS WHEN

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:15.307
LOOKING FOR MANAGER.

00:26:15.373 --> 00:26:17.776
PERFORMANCE MAY I COMMENT YES

00:26:17.842 --> 00:26:20.111
ABSOLUTELY GERMAN NHI&lt;c.cyan&gt; YOU&lt;/c&gt;

00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:21.379
WILL SEE RESULTS.

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:23.648
AND THERE HAVE BEEN RESULTS AND

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:26.785
AND IT MAY NOT BE TO THE

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:29.087
EXPECTATION THAT YOU YOU HAD.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:33.725
AND MAYBE THERE WAS A MAYBE

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:36.795
THERE WAS A IN IN ACCURACY OR

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:38.163
YOU WERE LED TO BELIEVE

00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:39.564
DIFFERENTLY THAN I THINK MAYBE

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:40.899
THAT WAS INTENDED.

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:41.933
IF THERE WAS EVER A FONT THAT

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.336
THIS THIS PROGRAMWAS GOING TO

00:26:44.402 --> 00:26:45.971
BE ABLE TO GET THESE NUMBERS

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:47.539
DOWN.

00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:49.207
TO ZERO THAT MAY BE IT MAY HAVE

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.141
BEEN IN THEORY IF ALL THE

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:51.042
NUMBERS IN THE STATE OF

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:53.211
CALIFORNIA STAYED THE SAME BUT

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:55.146
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN INCREASING --

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:56.514
WE HAD LIMITED TERM POSITIONS I

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:57.782
KNOW YOU'RE AWARE OF ALL THE

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:58.350
PROBLEMS WITH TRYING TO FILL

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:01.252
THOSE -- I CAN I CAN DEFINITELY

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.921
ARRANGE TO HAVE A A MEETING WITH

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:04.122
YOU TO SHOW YOU THE NUMBERS AND

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:05.256
SORTS STATISTICS HELP YOU

00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:06.925
UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE HAD A A

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:08.560
POSITIVE INC IMPACT AND HAVING

00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:10.628
THOSE NUMBERS REDUCE -- THE THE

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:12.163
ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND STAFF

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.764
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILL

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:15.100
DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO HAVE A

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:18.436
POSITIVE IMPACT IN REDUCING

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:19.671
THOSE NUMBERS.

00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:20.271
WHAT I THINK ONE THING WE HAVE

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:21.039
TO UNDERSTAND IS I DON'T THINK

00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:23.608
THAT NUMBER WILL EVER BE AT ZERO

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:24.509
IN THE REASON I SAY THAT IS WE

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:26.411
HAVE THIRTY PEOPLE A DAY OR MORE

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.579
BEING ADDED TO IT?

00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:29.080
ROUGHLY A THOUSAND A MONTH.

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:31.049
WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT TO GET

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.651
A GLASS SO WE'RE FIGHTING THAT

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:34.953
BATTLE -- I THINK WHAT WOULD

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.187
HELP US ALL UNDERSTAND

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:37.922
REALISTICALLY IS WHAT IS A

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:39.824
MAINTENANCE LEVEL THAT THAT

00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:41.726
NUMBER COULD BE AT THAT WE'RE

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.894
ALL.

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:44.863
SOMEWHAT ACCEPTABLE WITH I DON'T

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:45.930
KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BUT I'M

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:48.400
ESTIMATING SOMEWHERE IN A FOUR

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:49.801
THOUSAND RANGE SO RIGHT NOW WE

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:51.469
HAVE ROUGHLY.

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:52.504
NINE THOUSAND ACTIVE ARMED AND

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:53.671
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE STILL

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:55.507
TRYING TO CHIP AWAY AT

00:27:55.573 --> 00:27:57.242
EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY WITH THE

00:27:57.308 --> 00:27:58.410
ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND PERMANENT

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.744
POSITIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT WE

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:00.745
CAN GET THESE NUMBERS DOWN

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:02.380
CLOSER TO SOMETHING MORE

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:03.515
MAINTAINABLE.

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:04.916
LIKE FOUR THOUSAND ON A

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:07.285
STATEWIDE BASIS WITH US WORKING

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.853
CLOSELY WITH THE LOCALS.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.189
THAT I THINK IS MORE REALISTIC

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:12.924
AND UNDERSTANDABLE TO ALL OF US --

00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:14.159
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:15.927
THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL IN THIS

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:16.961
ENVIRONMENT WHETHER IT'S NEW

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:18.630
LAWS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:20.432
NEW FIREARMS THAT ARE.

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:22.567
BEING CONSIDERED -- ILLEGAL

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:23.935
WHATEVER'S HAPPENING THAT CAUSES

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:25.904
THE NUMBERS INCREASE WERE ALWAYS

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.373
FIGHTING THAT BATTLE -- SO I I

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.908
CAN I CAN TELL YOU THAT YES I

00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:33.278
THINK IT WILL HAVE A POSITIVE

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:33.878
IMPACT ON A THINK WE CAN SHOW

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:36.181
THAT.

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:38.216
YEAH I THINK -- JUST.

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:39.350
HISTORY.

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:41.820
ON US. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ONE

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:43.088
OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:44.422
THE PASS WAS.

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:46.491
OKAY OF THIS MODEL OF HIRING

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:48.026
MORE STAFF IN DOING THIS.

00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:50.228
DOESN'T WORK.

00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:51.696
MAY WE OUGHT TO DO SOME --

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:55.133
RETHINKING OF HOW WE IMPLEMENT

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.801
THIS PROGRAM MAYBE HAVE.

00:28:56.868 --> 00:29:01.306
MORE LOCAL PARTNERS ENGAGED IN A

00:29:01.372 --> 00:29:03.408
FIND OUT WHERE YOUR HOT SPOTS

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:06.044
ARE YOU KNOW LIKE WHERE THE THE

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:09.080
WORST AREAS ARE MAYBE.

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:11.282
HAVE SPECIAL -- I REPROACH IS

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:13.551
FOR THOSE AREAS I MEAN YOU YOU

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:15.153
YOU YOU YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.855
I MEAN PERFORMANCE MAJOR LOOK AT

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.356
ALL THE OPTIONS YOU KNOW JUST

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:19.491
KIND OF COME IN.

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:21.659
AND SAY WE NEED SHOULD WE JUST

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.161
NEED MORE STAFF THAT DOESN'T.

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:23.862
THAT'S WHEN WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.330
THAT'S A SIGN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:27.932
AT PERFORMANCE. TO BE HONEST

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.567
ABOUT IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:30.668
GOOD SIGN.

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:32.070
WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS I WANT TO

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:33.471
SEE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE?

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:34.873
ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU TRYING

00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:36.107
TO BE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:37.509
CREATING AN OPTION THAT WILL.

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:40.245
WILL WILL CUT DOWN THOSE NUMBERS

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:42.547
AND AND HELP FOR FOR SO WE DON'T

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:43.781
HAVE PEOPLE.

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:45.550
RUNNING AROUND SHOOTING --

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:47.352
PEOPLE THAT ARE.

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:48.853
NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.956
FIREARMS IN THEIR POSSESSION SO.

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:53.091
AND AND AGAIN WE DO WORK WITH

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.726
THE LOCALS.

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:56.594
ALL THE TIME IF THERE'S A WAY

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.863
THAT WE CAN -- FURTHER CONVINCED

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.465
THEM TO HAVE A AN INTEREST OR

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:03.535
DESIRE TO WORK WITH US.

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:06.070
AND IF THIS -- THIS INITIATIVE

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.138
THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT AS FAR

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:08.139
AS HAVING GRANT FUNDING WILL

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:09.741
HELP THAT IN A WAY I THINK

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:12.076
THAT'S FANTASTIC -- KEEPING IN

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:14.279
MIND NEED A LOT OF LOCAL AW LAW

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.947
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE ALSO

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.081
FIGHTING FOR FUNDING AND

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.750
RESOURCES AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:20.151
WHEN WE GO OUT AND WORK WITH

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:21.519
THEM OFTENTIMES IT WILL BE.

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:23.354
THEY ARE REASSIGNING PEOPLE ON

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:25.156
OVERTIME TO BE OUT WITH US IT'S

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.157
NOT THAT THEY CAN PULL SOMEBODY

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:28.626
OFF PATROL AND ASSIGNED TO US

00:30:28.693 --> 00:30:30.295
AND A AND A FULL TIME POSITION.

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:32.797
SO JUST LIKE WE ARE SPREAD THIN

00:30:32.864 --> 00:30:34.532
AND WORKING PEOPLE -- ON

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.434
OVERTIME AND ON WEEKENDS IT

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:38.770
WEARS FOLKS OUT AT THE LOCAL LAW

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:39.971
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT TO

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:40.939
DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE THEY

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:43.708
ASSIGN PEOPLE ON OVERTIME TO TO

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:44.509
WORK.

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:45.677
ON THESE ON THESE PROGRAMS AND

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:46.911
THAT'S BEEN SOME OF THE PROBLEM

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.746
AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- HIRING

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:49.280
IN FILLING SOME OF THESE

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:52.650
POSITIONS BECAUSE WE'RE SPREAD

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:53.351
SO THIN.

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:53.985
I THINK OUR AGENTS OR SOME OF

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:55.086
THE HARDEST WORKING INDIVIDUALS

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:56.321
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:57.121
SPECIFICALLY WITH THE BUREAU

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:58.389
FIREARMS BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:00.158
AVERAGING ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:01.492
A HUNDRED HOURS OF OVERTIME.

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:03.461
IN A MONTH THAT WORST PEOPLE OUT

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.296
AND SOME OTHER AGENTS ARE OUT

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.464
THERE IN THE CURRENT BUREAUS AT

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:07.899
THE RAN DON'T HAVE AN

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.133
INTERESTING COMING OVER WORKING

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.702
THAT HARD EVERY MONTH AND BEING

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:12.103
AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AS MUCH

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.004
AS OUR FOLKS ARE.

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:14.872
THAT'S THE REALITY OF A LOT OF

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:18.543
THIS.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.246
SO WE WE WILL -- HOLD IT OPEN --

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:22.780
AND I THINK ON YOUR THE

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:24.415
REFERENCE YOU MADE TO YOU KNOW

00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:26.918
THE DIFFICULTY FOR THE SOMETIMES

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.519
FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO ASSIST

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:29.921
IF THEY'RE UNDERFUNDED.

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:31.589
THAT'S ONE BENEFIT OF TRYING TO

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:34.158
PROVIDE THEM SOME RESOURCES TO

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:39.631
ASSIST -- BUT WHAT WE LOW COUPLE%

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:42.800
POINTS ONE IS VERY APPRECIATIVE

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.435
OF THE CLARIFICATION WHICH I

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:46.571
THINK WE ALL DO NEED TO ACCEPT

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:47.972
IS THAT.

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:51.142
WILL NEVER BE AT ZERO AND WHAT

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:53.444
IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO TALK ABOUT

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:55.179
WHAT WE THINK IS A REALISTIC

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:56.314
TARGET.

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:58.216
THAT WE'D WANT TO GET TO SO THAT

00:31:58.283 --> 00:32:02.654
AS WE LOOK AT HOW TO ACHIEVE IT.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.222
THEN WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE THAT

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:05.290
WHAT'S THE WORKLOAD THAT WOULD

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:08.192
BE REQUIRED AND WHAT IS THEN THE

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:14.232
THE BEST -- ALLOCATION OF

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:16.200
RESOURCES AND I THINK WHEN THE

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:18.670
AG WAS HERE THERE WAS HE

00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:20.938
EXPLAINED A LOT OF REASONS WHY

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.540
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO ACHIEVE ZERO

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:25.710
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE AREN'T FOUND

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:26.878
THEY'RE NOT AT THE ADDRESS THAT

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:27.478
YOU HAVE VARIOUS THINGS LIKE

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:28.446
THAT.

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:31.883
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE DO

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:33.384
YOU KNOW WHAT IS BOTH NOT ONLY

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:34.786
THE REALISTIC.

00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:36.721
BUT RATHER WHAT IS THE NUMBER

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.389
THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:40.258
OUT SO WE CAN FEEL.

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:41.659
WHEN WE GET A REPORT THAT REAL

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:43.561
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE NO I

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.229
THINK THAT?

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.531
IN ALL THE HEARINGS WE'VE HAD SO

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:49.067
FAR I THINK THERE HAS BEEN AN A.

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:51.269
EXPRESSION AND RECOGNITION THAT

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:54.706
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE -- IT OF

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:56.341
COURSE WE'D LIKE IT TO BE BETTER.

00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:57.642
SO.

00:32:57.709 --> 00:32:59.310
YOU KNOW THAT'S PART OF THIS IS

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.379
WHAT WHAT KIND OF TARGETS ARE WE

00:33:01.446 --> 00:33:02.814
REALLY HOPING TO ACHIEVE.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.116
BUT THEN ADDITIONALLY D. AG

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:09.020
RAISED WHEN HE WAS HERE THAT.

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:11.389
PART OF THE WHEN YOU FILLED THE

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:13.224
POSITIONS THAT HAVE

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:14.325
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:15.560
ENFORCEMENT.

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:17.762
THAT THEY OFTEN IN.

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:20.098
AS ANYONE WOULD IF THERE'S AN

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:23.368
OPENING IN A POSITION THAT.

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.837
GIVES THEM A A BETTER PAY OR A

00:33:25.903 --> 00:33:27.305
DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION THAT

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:28.840
THE MOVE ON AND THAT THIS IS

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:31.042
BEEN ONE OF THE ISSUES REGARDING

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:31.909
THE VACANCIES [inaudible]

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:33.811
NOW.

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:36.280
THE B. C. P. DOES NOT INCLUDE RE

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:38.716
CLASSIFICATION SO BUT THAT'S

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:40.151
CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT THE

00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:41.619
DIVISION ITSELF THE DEPARTMENT

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:43.321
ITSELF CAN THINK ABOUT WHETHER

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:44.389
IS THE PROBLEM.

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:46.290
WITH.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.359
FEELING THE POSITIONS A

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:50.161
CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM.

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.296
SO BUT THAT'S ON YOU KNOW RATHER

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:53.331
THAN US.

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:55.233
DICTATING THAT THAT'S ON THE

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:56.768
DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT AND COME

00:33:56.834 --> 00:33:59.270

POSSESSION OF FIREARMS.

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:33.224
THE DEAL RECORD OF SALE IS A

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.559

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:56.273
EVERYTHING WE NEED IN ORDER TO

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.108
BE ABLE TO HELP THE YOUTH REDUCE

00:42:58.175 --> 00:43:00.644
THE REST THAT THEY CAME TO DJJ.

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:01.645
FOUR AND SECONDLY WE NEED TO

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:03.147
CONTINUE TO CONSULT CULTIVATE A

00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:05.382
CULTURE A CULTURE THAT SUPPORTS

00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:07.751
THE MISSION -- I REFER TO THIS

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:11.288
REALLY A A CULTURE OF SUCCESS

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:12.089
AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THIS IS

00:43:12.156 --> 00:43:13.223
CHERYL IS ACHIEVED THROUGH A A

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.692
LAWSUIT BUT IT'S REALLY AN

00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.060
ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:18.796
PROCESS TO TO CHANGE THE CULTURE.

00:43:18.862 --> 00:43:19.630
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:21.498
BE WORKED ON CONTINUALLY TO BE

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:23.634
ONE THAT IS SUPPORTIVE OF A

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:25.035
YOUTH SUCCESS AND AND WHOLLY

EMBRACES THAT AND THAT'S

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.072
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:30.708
WORKING ON THIRD IS TO BUILD UP

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:31.709
THE STRENGTH BASS BASS AS I CALL

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:32.776
IT.

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:33.944
WE IN THE EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:35.346
THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT WE

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:37.348
HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED TO HELP

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:38.282
YOU TO BE ABLE TO LEARN IN A

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:39.450
SENSE HOW NOT TO FIGHT.

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:41.785
BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE TO THAT IN

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.087
HELPING TO USE RETURN SAFELY TO

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:44.321

THAT YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN A

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.157
REASON WHY NOT TO FIGHT AND

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.225
EMOTIONAL.

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:50.427
MOTIVATION AS TO WHY THEY WANT

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.695
TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE TOOLS

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:52.863
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.999
NOT A LARGE PART OF THE FEDERAL

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:57.201
LAWSUIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:59.336
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO BUILD

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:02.373
ON THEIR STRENGTHS -- VOCATIONAL

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:04.174
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING --

THEM -- IN PURSUING IT INITIALLY

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:13.917
AND MATCHING IN THE POSSIBILITY

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.185
OF A DIFFERENT IDENTITY THAN THE

00:44:15.252 --> 00:44:17.187
ONES THAT THEY BELIEVED IN

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.088
THEMSELVES WALKING IN.

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.323
AND TO BE ABLE TO CREATE

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.958
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO NOT

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.292
JUST THINK ABOUT THE LIFE THAT

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:24.228
THEY WANT TO BEGIN LIVING WHEN

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:25.129
THEY LEAVE BUT TO BEGIN LIVING

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:27.264
THAT WHILE THEY ARE WITH US AND

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:29.066
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE -- HAVE

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:31.468
ASPIRATIONS AND ATTACHMENTS THE

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:32.436
CONTINUE ON INTO THE COMMUNITY

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:33.871
TO BE ABLE TOLIVE THAT LIFE

00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:36.206
WHEN THEY LEAVE -- IT WHEN THEY

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:37.908
LEAVE DJJ AND WE WE BELIEVE VERY

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:40.411
STRONGLY -- THAT AT THIS

00:44:40.477 --> 00:44:42.346
PARTICULAR POINT IN DJS DAY'S

00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:51.221
JOURNEY OF REFORM AND GROWTH --

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:52.856
THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL TO

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:54.258
MOVE US OUT OF THE ADULT PRISON

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:55.426
SYSTEM INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:56.527
SERVICE AGENCY IS RIGHT ON TRACK

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:57.127
AND A MILESTONE THAT WILL BE

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:57.961
VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:58.629
TO FULFILL.

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.230
THOSE THREE TARGETS THAT I JUST

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:01.698
REFERRED TO AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:03.534
THAT AND BECAUSE I'M SURE

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.134
THEY'LL BE QUESTIONS AND MORE

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:07.304
DISCUSSION THANK YOU.

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.440

HIS TEAM -- I THINK THIS IS

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:14.545
GOING TO BE A GREAT FIT TO HELP

00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:16.013
THEM IMPROVE ON THE PROGRESS

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.214
THEY'VE MADE THROUGH THE FOR A

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.749
LAWSUIT AND HE TO BUILD THAT

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.551
THERAPEUTIC REHABILITATED

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:21.251
MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT THE

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:22.653
NEW DEPARTMENT -- YOU KNOW OUR

AND THAT'S FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:28.058
JUVENILE JUSTICE IS HEADING IN

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.326
THE DEPARTMENT.

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.461
SO WITH THAT WE THINK WERE A YOU

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:32.062
CAN DECISION SUPPORT THEM IN

00:45:32.129 --> 00:45:33.163
THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:34.465
HELPING FOSTER THAT CULTURE

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:36.133
CHANGE AS WELL AS HELPING TO

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.901
CONNECT THEM TO LOCALS.

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:39.169
IN CITY IN OUR DIVERSE

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:42.840
DEPARTMENTS TO HELP WITH

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.775
INTEGRATION THANK YOU.

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:45.375
AND WE DID NOT BRING THE CHOIR

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:57.121
BUT IT WAS.

00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:59.456
I KNOW THAT ARE AT LEAST HAVE

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:01.125
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND I

00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:02.159
KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.594
PUBLIC COMMENT AND CERTAINLY ON

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.529
MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE.

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:06.230
BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE LA --

00:46:06.296 --> 00:46:09.733
FIRST AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF THE

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.300
PART IN FINANCE WANTS

00:46:10.367 --> 00:46:10.601
[inaudible]

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:13.604
TO ADD.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:14.471
MORNING LUCAS MORROW WITH THE

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:17.207
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:18.175
CONCERT IN THIS PROPOSAL WE

00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:19.443
IDENTIFIED A FEW QUESTIONS FOR

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.145
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION.

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:22.746
THE FIRST IS WHETHER DJ NEEDS TO

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:25.082
BE REORGANIZED TO IMPROVE

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:26.250
REHABILITATION.

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:28.018
WILL NOTE THAT THE MOST RECENT

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:29.753
DATA ON RECIDIVISM COMES FROM

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.956
THE COURT THAT WAS RELEASED IN

00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:34.925
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN.

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:35.559
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE FELLOW

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:37.728
LAWSUIT DID NOT END UNTIL.

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:38.996
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND AS A

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.264
RESULT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE DJ

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.665
IS CURRENTLY PERFORMING AT

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:44.034
REHABILITATING YOUTH -- OUR NEXT

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:44.902
QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT ARE THE

00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:45.469
POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:47.804
PROPOSED REORGANIZATION.

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:48.272
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:49.206
IDENTIFIED.

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:50.741
MULTIPLE OUTCOMES AND TARGET TO

00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:52.843
THEY WOULD HOPE TO ACHIEVE WITH

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.745
THIS REORGANIZATION HOWEVER IT'S

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.613
NOT CLEAR OR HOW THIS WE

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.481
ORGANIZATION WOULD ACCOMPLISH

00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:58.148
THESE.

00:46:58.215 --> 00:46:59.950
OUTCOMES OR WHY THEY CANNOT BE

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:01.685
PERFORMED WITHIN THE CURRENT

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:05.422
STRUCTURE UNDERSEA DC ARE.

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:06.023
OUR NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT ARE

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:07.558
THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:10.227
THE REORGANIZATION.

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:11.662
WITHOUT UNDER KNOWING HOW

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.730
THEY'LL OPERATIONALIZE THESE.

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:15.999
THIS REORGANIZATION AND HOW THEY

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:16.633
WILL ACCOMPLISH THESE OUTCOMES

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.401
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT IT WOULD

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:20.571
IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH.

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:22.739
THEY COULD ALSO INCREASED COSTS --

00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:23.774
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE SOME

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.275
SERVICES A COMPANY SHARED

00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:28.178
BETWEEN D. J. J. M. C. C. R.

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:29.313
THESE ARE POTENTIALLY TO BE

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:32.683
DUPLICATED ON THE REALIZATION.

00:47:32.749 --> 00:47:33.317
IN ADDITION THERE COULD BE OTHER

00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:34.351
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:34.685
COMPLICATING.

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:35.886
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE NEW

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:38.789
DEPARTMENT AND CDC ARE.

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:39.556
OUR NEXT QUESTION IS ALL THE

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.291
ALTERNATIVE ORGANIZATIONAL

00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:43.493
STRUCTURES THAT COULD BE --

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.163
LOOKED AT WE LOOKED AT HOW OTHER

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.264
STATES HAVE ORGANIZED OF

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:48.999
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.467
HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT WHILE MANY

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:51.435
SIX TO HAVE THEIR JUVENILE

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:53.136
JUSTICE SYSTEMS UNDER HEALTH AND

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:54.638
HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY.

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.907
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:57.507
ABOUT HALF THE STATE TO THAT

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:58.609
STRUCTURE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:01.678
THAT MODEL TO A DIFFERENT MODEL --

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.247
MOST COMMONLY AUTO TO BECOME AN

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:04.615
INDEPENDENT DEPARTMENT THAT'S

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:06.283
NOT UNDER AN AGENCY OR PUT IT

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:08.652
INTO AN AGENCY THAT SPECIFICALLY.

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.588
FOR FOCUSED ON CHILDREN AND

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.023
FAMILIES.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.992
WE ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:16.560
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO FULLY WE

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:17.527
ALIGN.

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.463
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:21.465
COUNTIES CURRENTLY ABOUT 30% OF

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:23.100
INCARCERATED YOUTH ARE HELD IN

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:25.002
DJJ WITH THE REMAINDER AT THE

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.770
COUNTY LEVEL.

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.505
AND BOTH COUNTY FACILITIES AND

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:30.741
STATE FACILITIES ARE AT ABOUT

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:32.309
ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL CAPACITY.

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:33.577
SO IT COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.245
SENSE FROM A PHYSICAL STANDPOINT

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:36.980
TO REORGANIZE THE WE LINE TO THE

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:39.316
GYM -- COUNTIES AND ALSO IT

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:40.484
COULD POTENTIALLY BRING THOSE

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.452
HE'S CLOSER TO THE SUPPORT

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:44.521
STRUCTURE SUCH AS FAMILIES.

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:47.658
ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO KEEP

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:51.228
DJ WITH N. C. C. R. AND FOCUS ON

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:53.130
ELIMINATING ANY BARRIERS IF THEY

00:48:53.196 --> 00:48:54.665
ARE IDENTIFIED TO REHABILITATION

00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:56.333
WITHIN CDC ARE FACED WITH

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.968
POTENTIALLY ALSO HAVE A BENEFIT

00:48:58.035 --> 00:48:59.469
TO THE ADULT SYSTEM.

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:01.505
WHICH HOUSES A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:02.105
SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:03.807
PRISON AND ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.043
PEOPLE ON FOR COMPETITIVE AT

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:10.814
ABOUT 700-100-0700 PEOPLE IN.

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.549

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.054
QUESTIONS IN A COUPLE COMMENTS.

00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:02.459
MY FIRST COMMENT IS.

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:04.628
I APPRECIATE THE LA OWES RAISING

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.830
THOSE ISSUES -- BECAUSE IT IS

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:12.135
COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE FOR US.

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:13.637
TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:15.338
THAT THIS MOVE [inaudible]

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:17.340
WILL [inaudible]

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:19.242
IMPROVE REHABILITATION.

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:21.578
BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:22.946
THAT'S OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE AND

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.648
IF WE LOOK.

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.450
MEAN SOME SOME OF THE CHANGES

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:27.484
WE'VE MADE OBVIOUSLY OVERTIME

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.952
WERE DUE TO LAWSUITS BUT IF WE

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:31.221
LOOK AT OUR TRAJECTORY AND HOW

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:33.056
WE ARE DEALING WITH ALL OF OUR

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:35.025
INCARCERATED POPULATION WHETHER

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:36.560
YOUTH OR ADULTS [inaudible]

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:38.328
WE HAVE.

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:39.796
OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:42.732
BEEN MOVING MUCH MORE TOWARDS.

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:44.000
WELL FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:46.837
ACCEPTING THAT THE PEOPLE WE

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.405
HOLD WILL RETURN TO THEIR

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:50.307
COMMUNITIES AND SO IF PUBLIC

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:52.242
SAFETY IS OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:53.844
OBJECTIVE.

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.579
WHAT DO WE DO WHILE THEY ARE IN

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:59.583
OUR -- WELL AT THE POINT THAT

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:01.718
DURING THE TIME.

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:04.554
THAT WE HOLD HIM IN CUSTODY.

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.656
WHAT IS OUR ROLE TO HELP INSURE

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:09.192
THAT WHEN THEY ARE RETURNED HOME?

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:10.927
THAT WE HAVE MAXIMIZED THE

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.863
OBJECTIVE OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:18.602
AND I THINK THAT -- THE

00:52:18.668 --> 00:52:20.470
LEGISLATURE OVER TIME HAS COME

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:22.472
TO EMBRACE THAT [inaudible]

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:24.374
THAT.

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:27.010
THAT IN THE PAST.

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:28.879
DEAR THE WHAT I MIGHT CALL THE

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:30.514
MORE PUNITIVE MODEL WELL

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.883
CERTAINLY INCARCERATION WILL

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:35.685
REMAIN TO BE SOME LEVEL OF AT

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:38.355
BEING PUNITIVE BECAUSE IT IS.

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.924
WITHDRAWING SOMEONE'S FREEDOM.

00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:42.592
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:44.594
RECOGNITION THAT.

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.364
IF WE ACCEPT AND UNDERSTAND THAT

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.999
THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:50.901
RETURNING TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:52.402
AND OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:53.703
OBJECTIVE IS A STATE IS PUBLIC

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.339
SAFETY THEN WE THAT PUNISHMENT

00:52:56.406 --> 00:52:58.608
ALONE WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATE TO

00:52:58.675 --> 00:53:00.343
ASSURE PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT WE

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.678
HAVE.

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:03.713
TO UTILIZE THE TIME THAT WE ARE

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.916
HOLDING PEOPLE IN CUSTODY IN A

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:08.652
WAY TO EQUIP THEM. TO AND MAKE

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:10.554
AND HELP US FEEL ASSURED THAT

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.455
WHEN THEY RETURN THAT OUR PUBLIC

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:16.259
SAFETY IS BEING -- INSURED ALSO.

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:18.962
SO IN WE KNOW THAT.

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.131
JUVENILES ARE VERY UNIQUE

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:23.166
POPULATION AND OF COURSE IN THE

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:27.003
LAST FIVE YEARS ESPECIALES.

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.238
NINETY SIX SEVEN THE AMOUNT OF

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:30.240
RESEARCH THAT IS SHOWN THE BRAIN

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.475
DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:34.344
WELL WE ALWAYS HAD QUESTIONS

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:35.946
ABOUT THE ABILITY OF JUVENILES

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:37.147
TO EXHIBIT THE SAME JUDGMENT AS

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:37.981
ADULTS.

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:39.516
I THINK WE MAY NOT HAVE

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:41.318
UNDERSTOOD SO FULLY HOW MUCH

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:43.720
THEY REALLY ARE NOT ADULTS THAT

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.822
REALLY THESE A WHOLE LOT OF

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:48.992
CAPACITIES. FOR DECISIONS FOR

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:51.194
RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR AND SUCH

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:53.630
ARE REALLY NOT DEVELOPED.

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:57.767
UNTIL A AN AGE PASSED

00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:58.068
[inaudible]

00:53:58.134 --> 00:53:58.935
ADOLESCENCE.

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:00.737
SO I THINK ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:02.405
COME INTO PLAY IN THIS NOW.

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:04.774
I AM GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:07.277
THIS MOVE.

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:09.279
BECAUSE I FEEL THAT PART OF WHAT

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.480
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS A

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.815
CULTURE CHANGE [inaudible]

00:54:11.881 --> 00:54:15.852
AND BY.

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.621
WITH THIS UNIQUE POPULATION OF

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.855
JUVENILES [inaudible]

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:23.460
IF WE CONTINUE WITHIN A CULTURE

00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:27.564
OF A MORE PUNITIVE CULTURE THAT

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:30.367
ARE CDC ARE IS IT.

00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:31.501
YOU KNOW WHILE WE'RE IN THE

00:54:31.568 --> 00:54:33.403
MIDST OF SOME TRANSITION IS

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.939
STILL ESSENTIALLY THAT'S ITS

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:37.807
FOCUS.

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:39.943
THAT TE AGENCY OF HEALTH AND

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.811
HUMAN SERVICES AT LEAST

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.313
COMMUNICATE THAT WITH THIS

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:49.786
POPULATION WE ARE REALLY MOVING

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:50.820
TO AN AGENCY.

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:53.156
ACHIEVE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:55.592
WHERE AT LEAST FOR SOME OF US

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:56.793
THOSE OF US WHO ARE.

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.495
ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS WANT TO

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:01.531
BE ASSURED THAT THIS IS NOT JUST

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:05.035
A AGENCY CHANGE AND THAT IN FACT

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:08.304
WE ARE PREPARED AND EQUIPPED. TO

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:11.441
DO THE TYPE OF CULTURE CHANGE SO

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:13.209
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE HE

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:14.878
OUTCOMES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:16.046
HAS IDENTIFIED.

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:17.681
BUT MY QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:20.116
SUCCESS MARKERS ARE WE UTILIZING

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:22.719
TO GUIDE THISTRANSITION.

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.587
AND ARE THERE STATES THAT WE

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:26.990
MIGHT LOOK TO AS MODELS THAT YOU

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:29.325
YOU MAY BE LOOKING AT AS A MODEL.

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:32.095
IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.663
WHICHEVER VIEW.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.565
SURE I THINK THAT.

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:37.233
REALLY WITHIN BOTH THE JUVENILE

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.868
AS WELL AS ADULTS SYSTEMS

00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:40.303
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THERE ARE

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.272
EXAMPLES THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:43.406
AND ARE PULLING FROM.

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:45.275
I WANTED TO SHARE WITH REGARD TO

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.510
THE THE CULTURE PIECE IN THE

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:48.778
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THERE'S

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:49.979
ACTUALLY SPECIFIC.

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:52.916
LANGUAGE WITH REGARD TO MISSION --

00:55:52.982 --> 00:55:53.483
AND THE MISSION THAT WE'RE

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.452
PROPOSING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.053
YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.254
IS THE YOUTH.

00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:00.890
WHO HAVE HURT PEOPLE?

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:02.158
AND HAD BEEN HURT THEMSELVES.

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:03.760
RETURN SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:05.562
AND BECOME RESPONSIBLE AND

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:07.197
SUCCESSFUL ADULTS.

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.164
I THINK THAT SPEAKS ON ON A

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:09.432
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS IN

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.568
TERMS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT WE'VE

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:12.502
PULLED FROM.

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:15.405
OTHER MODELS AS WELL AS OUR OWN

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:16.172
EXPERIENCE.

00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:17.540
WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD HERE ONE

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:20.110
JUST.

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:21.411
RIGHT OFF THE BAT SAYING THAT

00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:23.146
THE YOUTH WHO COME TO US.

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.682
ALL OF THEM HAVE HURT SOMEBODY.

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:26.282
AND THAT'S THE REASON IS THAT

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.850
THEY ARE [inaudible]

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.418
WITH US.

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:29.452
AND THAT THERE'S A VICTIM

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:31.221
ASSOCIATED WITH EVERYBODY WHO IS

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:32.555
COMING [inaudible]

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:34.657

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:10.420
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THERE IS NOT

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:12.222

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:14.324

REMOVE SOMEBODY FROM SOCIETY

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:03.506

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BOTH IN

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:41.510
TERMS OF REDUCING THOSE RISKS

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.345

AND SO BY BEING A PART OF THAT

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:59.395
DEPARTMENT WE WILL BE CLOSER TO

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.763
WORKING FAR MORE COLLABORATIVELY

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:01.897
WITH THE VERY AGENCIES

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.432
DEPARTMENTS SERVICES THAT ARE

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:05.034
CRITICAL TO THE POPULATION.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.535
THAT WE READ THAT WE RECEIVE AND

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.137
AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVING

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:09.371
IN ADDITION WITH REGARD TO THE

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:11.373
TRANSITION A NUMBER OF THOSE

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.776
SERVICES -- SUPPORTS AND AND

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:14.877
RESOURCES AND THE LIKE ARE ALSO

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.545
SITUATED WITHIN THAT APARTMENT

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:18.247
IN BEING ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.915
WITH THEM EARLIER ON TO BE ABLE

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.517
TO PLAN FOR THAT TRANSITION SO

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:22.818
THAT THAT SUPPORT WILL BE OUT

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.119
THERE WHEN THE RETURN.

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:29.592
IS ANOTHER CRITICAL. TWENTY

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:32.861
WORDS SORRY.

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:35.064
YOU A FACTUAL SOONER WE CAN SEND

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:35.698

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:39.468
THESE ARE THE OUTCOMES WERE

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:40.269
EXPECTING IT'S GONNA BE BETTER

KIND OF JUST MAKE IT REAL SIMPLE.

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.743
TO I UNDERSTAND AND I APOLOGIZE

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:48.510

SAID THAT IT DID IT JUST DOESN'T

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:50.512
MAKE SENSE THAT THE JUVENILE

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.114
JUSTICE SYSTEM SHOULD BE A PART

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.716
OF THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM.

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:54.817
THAT THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT THEY

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.151
SHOULD BE THE END OF THE LINE

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:57.820
THE LAST STOP IN A YOUNG

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:58.354
PERSON'S.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.555
JOURNEY THROUGH THE JUVENILE

01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:01.190
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT THE NEXT

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:03.559
STOP IS NOT A PRISON CELL THE

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:04.193
NEXT STOP IS.

DELIBERATIONS.

EXPLORE THAT.

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.969
BEFORE WE START FINALIZING THE

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.304
BUDGET AGREEMENT HERE.

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:39.474
ON THIS ISSUE.

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:41.576
THAT'S MY FEELING.

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.011
AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF

01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:44.379
YOU KNOW THIS IS A NEW ITEM IN A

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:45.547
WE WANNA.

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:48.049

01:24:58.259 --> 01:24:59.561
TO MAKE THIS WORK BECAUSE I

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:01.629
THINK IF YOU DID IT RIGHT.

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:03.097
AND THAT'S A BIG CABBIE OUT A

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:04.199
COULD BENEFIT THE YOUNG PEOPLE

AS OF I KNOW YOU REALLY CARE

01:25:06.067 --> 01:25:07.635

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:11.773
YEARS TRUCKS SO.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.576

THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOU SAY

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:17.645

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:18.813
FUTURE.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.682
AND DIVERT HIM FROM.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.183
OUR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.419
AND SO SO I I I WOULD LIKE TO

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.488
SEE THAT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:31.626

NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED OF FUN

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:40.235
SOME FUNDING. TO ROUTE OF

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:40.869
LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:45.673
SOURCES -- SB OF TWO EIGHTY FOUR

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.509
JUST ONE FOR MEDI CAL.

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:48.476
THE PST T. OTHER KINDS OF

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:50.945
SOURCES.

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:53.014
SO I I I I HOPE THAT THAT COULD

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:54.449
BE PART OF OUR DISCUSSION HERE

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:57.352
IN OUR COMPANY.

01:25:57.418 --> 01:26:00.555
THANK YOU SIR ROLAND -- THE

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.290
RECOMMENDATION WAS TO HOLD THIS

ITEM OPEN -- BUT FOLLOWING

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:09.898
EARNED SOME OF THIS COMMON

01:26:09.964 --> 01:26:14.836
DISCUSSION SO FAR.

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:16.037
WE HAVE THIS INTERESTING

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.438
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE.

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.340
WE HAVE.

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:20.508
WELL ONE THING WE SHOULD BE VERY

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:23.177
PROUD OF IS THAT OVER TIME.

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:24.879
NOT ONLY DO THE LAWSUITS BUT DUE

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:26.915
TO OTHER ACTIONS THAT.

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.483
LEGISLATURE.

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:30.351
AND AT FOUR MINUTES TAKEN.

01:26:30.418 --> 01:26:33.321
THE POPULATION OF JUVENILES THAT

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.889
WE HOLD IN THE STATE FACILITY

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:37.191
HAS GREATLY REDUCED.

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:40.261
AND AND I THINK THAT SIGNIFICANT.

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.730
BECAUSE MANY OF IF WE AGAIN

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:45.033
THINK ABOUT WHAT'S OUR OBJECTIVE

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:45.900
WITH.

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:48.436
IF ANY JUVENILES THAT ENCOUNTER.

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.138
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OUR

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.573
OBJECTIVE OF OF COURSE IS OF

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:54.042
COURSE TO HAVE THAT BE THE LAST

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:55.543
STOP IN SO.

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:57.946
THE THE MORE WE CAN HANDLE THEM

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.714
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY SYSTEMS NOT

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:00.882
EVEN IN COUNTY.

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:02.750
JUVENILE FACILITIES PURCHASING

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.786
COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEMS AND SO

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:05.954
WE'VE SEEN BOTH THERE'S THIS

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.822
VERY SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:10.758
POPULATION OF WHO WE OLD WHEN I

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:12.327
WAS ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:14.329
EIGHT IT WAS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:17.565
I BELIEVE.

01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:18.132
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO THREE

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:19.334
THOUSAND AND WE'RE NOW AT ABOUT.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.036
SEVEN HUNDRED AND NOW IF WE LOOK.

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.538
AT THE SAME TIME WE LOOK AT OUR

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:25.139
POPULATION.

01:27:25.206 --> 01:27:27.375
IN THE COUNTY FACILITIES IN THE

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:29.944
JUNE OKAY I MEAN CENTER BILLS

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.379
GOT CHARTS LIKE I MEAN IT'S

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:34.616
UNBELIEVABLE HOW MANY BEDS.

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:35.183
EACH.

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:36.050
COUNTY YOUR DIFFERENT COUNTIES

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:38.052
HAVE.

01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:39.754
AND YET THE NUMBER OF JUVENILES

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:41.856
HELD IN THOSE COUNTY SO FOR

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:47.495
EXAMPLE -- THE LOS ANGELES IS

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:50.298
DOWN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX

01:27:50.365 --> 01:27:52.066
JUVENILES IN THEIR OWN

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:54.202
FACILITIES.

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:56.270
OR FOR THESE ARE OUR FACILITIES

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:57.505
OKAY SORRY HIS OTHER.

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:59.007
SENATOR BILLS WHEN HE SAID

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.041
MINUTE WHICH HE PASSED OUT TWICE

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:03.111
LAST WEEK HAD THE NUMBERS OF

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:05.079
LA'S EVEN WITHIN THEIR OWN

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:07.181
FACILITIES IT'S DROPPED.

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:09.417
TO ITS THE IT'S A VERY SMALL

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:11.919
NUMBER AS AS COMPARED TO THE

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:14.656
NUMBER OF BEDS IT HAS.

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:17.191
ENDED AND THE CAPACITY AT HALAS

01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:19.560
SO IN ALMOST ALL OF OUR COUNTIES

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.029
ARE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND WE

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:23.998
HAVE SOME COUNTIES THAT HAVE.

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:25.366
ZERO KIDS IN THERE.

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:27.001
I POINT THE IN THEIR JUVENILE

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:30.405
FACILITY COUNTY BASED NO I POINT

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:33.174
THAT OUT BECAUSE STATEWIDE BOTH

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:34.375
ARE LOCALS.

01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:36.377
AND WE IS THE STATE HAVE BEEN

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.246
MOVING IN THE DIRECTION.

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:39.747
OF A DIFFERENT MODEL TO DEAL

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:41.482
WITH JUVENILES.

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:45.286
NOW I SEE THIS AS COMPLIMENTARY

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:48.089
TO IN PARALLEL TO THAT MOVEMENT.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:48.990
THIS.

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:52.126
ADOPTION OF MOVING THE DIVISION

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:54.962
INTO MOVING THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.764
JUVENILE JUSTICE INTO.

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.132
THE DIVISION OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:00.034
SERVICES AND RENAMING IT THE

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.602
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:02.937
COMMUNITY RESTORATION.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.773
NOW THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:06.874
THESE.

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:09.310
YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:11.245
SMALLER FACILITIES COMMUNITY

01:29:11.312 --> 01:29:12.213
BASED.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.248
IS DEFINITELY A LEGITIMATE ONE

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:16.084
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:17.318
LOOP LEGISLATURE TO HAVE

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:18.119
OVERTIME.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:19.721
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FIRST

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:21.823
RECALL.

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:23.224
WHO THESE JUVENILES ARE THAT ARE

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:25.159
IN OUR STATE?

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:27.628
FACILITIES THEY ARE.

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:30.198
UNLESS OUR LOCALS ARE.

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:32.467
CHARGING THEM VERY INACCURATELY

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:33.701
THEY ARE.

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:37.538
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE.

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:40.108
EXHIBITED THE MOST HAVE.

01:29:40.174 --> 01:29:41.409
COMMITTEDTHE MOST VIOLENT

01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:45.279
CRIMES IN WHO.

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:47.815
WOULD THAT WOULD IF WE AGAIN

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:50.218
TRUSTS THE PROCESS FOR WHICH

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:53.454
THEY WERE CHARGED AND CONVICTED.

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:55.857
MIGHT BE THE GREATEST RISK TO US

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:58.226
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:29:58.292 --> 01:30:00.495
AND THAT'S SAID WELL THAT TO ME

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.464
DOES NOT NECESSARILY ARGUE

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:06.501
AGAINST A MODEL THAT WOULD.

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:08.703
ALLOW SMALLER FACILITIES AND

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.071
MORE COMMUNITY BASED.

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:13.541
IT'S CERTAINLY TELLS ME THAT.

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:16.410
AS WE TRANSITION.

01:30:16.477 --> 01:30:17.278
AND GIVEN THAT.

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:20.581
THAT WE HAVE DISCO HORDE NOW.

01:30:20.648 --> 01:30:22.984
WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH THOSE

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:25.253
TRANSITIONS VERY CAREFULLY.

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:28.689
AND WE NEED TO SEE WHETHER THE

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:29.991
TYPE OF CULTURE CHANGE IN

01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:32.393
THERAPEUTIC MODEL THAT.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.495
I BELIEVE THIS MISSION IS TRYING

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.798
TO ACHIEVE WILL WORK.

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:39.066
AND IN A WAY.

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:40.601
WE COULDDEBATE ABOUT WHETHER

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:42.370
IT'S BETTER TESTED.

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.605
IN THESE MORE CENTRALIZED

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:46.474
FACILITIES OR NOT I MEAN THERE'S

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:49.143
DOWNSIDES DEFINITELY BECAUSE

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:50.545
THOSE FACILITIES WERE MORE

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:54.248
DESIGNED. TO BE LIKE PRISONS.

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:56.450
AND THEY YOU KNOW SO THERE ARE

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:57.451
DEFINITE DOWNSIDES.

01:30:57.518 --> 01:31:00.922
BUT I AM WILLING TO LOOK AT THIS

THIS BE KIND OF OUR LABORATORY

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.533
FOR CASTING.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.568
THESE NEW THINGS [inaudible]

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:17.538
AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:19.440
THIS TRANSITION IS I WOULD LIKE

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.209
TO SEE THE NAME CHANGE SOONER SO

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:22.977
THAT IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:25.513
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EMBARKING ON I

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.915
WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:30.084
M. MAYBE A MORE FORMALIZED

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:32.086
STAKEHOLDER GROUP.

AGAIN I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSION

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:35.423
ABOUT THAT.

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:37.425
SO THAT WE REALLY ARE FORMALLY

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:40.094
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXPERTS IN

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.797
THIS FIELD.

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:44.932
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:48.102
THE ARE POTENTIALLY WHETHER WE

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:50.771
PILOTED WHETHER WE DO IT FOR ALL

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:54.175
THE FACILITIES BUT WE KNOW THAT

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:55.843
OUR EXISTING STAFF.

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.812
WELL SOME OF THEM HAVE SOCIAL

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:58.913
WORK IN OTHER DEGREES STEP

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.483
PRIMARILY THE EXISTING STAFF.

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:03.684
YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE MODEL

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:06.454
THAT THEY WERE EITHER TRAIN FOR

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.722
HIRED FOR SO.

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:10.057
THERE'S IN THE TRAILER BILL

01:32:10.124 --> 01:32:12.193
CLEARER -- AN ALLOCATION REQUEST

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.895
OF RESOURCES AND CLEARED

01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:16.464
DESCRIPTION OF A WHOLE NEW

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.666
ACADEMY A WHOLE NEW TRAINING

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:20.034
COMPONENT WHICH I SUPPORT.

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:23.638
BUT AS WE'RE PREPARING AND

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:26.274
TRANSITIONING OUR EXISTING STAFF.

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:28.342
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WAS

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:32.580
USEFUL TO HAVE.

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:34.548
SOME OF THIS THERAPEUTIC

01:32:34.615 --> 01:32:36.517
COMMUNITY MODEL.

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:38.486
ALREADY. TO TO IMPLEMENTED

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:41.188
WITHIN SOME OF THESE FACILITIES

01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:42.490
SO THAT.

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:44.859
WE CAN IN A WAY TESTED AND SO

01:32:44.926 --> 01:32:46.494
THAT ARE EXISTING STAFF CAN SEE

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.695
HOW IT WORKS.

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:50.298
AND IF WE LOOK AT THE ADULT SIDE

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:51.766
WE HAVE CREATED THESE

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:53.434
THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES IN A

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.303
COUPLE OF ADULT PRISONS IN RG

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:57.004
DONOVAN IN LANCASTER A COUPLE

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:59.340
OTHER PLACES WHERE WE WE USE

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:03.477
SMALLER COHORTS OF INDIVIDUALS --

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:07.014
AND WE HAVE -- WE ENGAGE A WHOLE

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:11.285
DIFFERENT KIND OF OF FAT

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:13.120
PROGRAMMING WITH THEM -- WHEN

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:14.322
WHILE THEY'RE STILL HOUSED IN

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:16.857
OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITY THESE

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:18.993
ADULTS THE MOST OF THEIR

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.062
PROGRAMMING AND A GOOD PORTION

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:22.897
OF THEIR DAYS SPENT IN NEEDS

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:25.833
THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY TYPE MODEL --

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.969
SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:30.838
START SOONER THAN LATER AND THAT

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:33.174
MAY REQUIRE US HAVING TO DEVELOP

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.042
A NORTH P. IN USING AN EXTERNAL

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:36.210
ENTITY.

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:40.614
BUT IT COULD ALSO ALLOW US. TO

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:42.950
TO START ARTICULATING WHAT IS

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:44.352
WHERE CERTAINLY WE HAVE A

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:46.120
MISSION AND I DON'T MEAN I'M NOT

01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:47.822
IN ANY WAY MINIMIZING THAT THE

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:49.290
TRAILER BILL HAS A MISSION BUT

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:51.192
IN OUR FEED COULD START

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:52.093
ARTICULATING.

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:53.961
TYPE OF THERAPEUTIC MANY WERE

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:55.429
TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:58.599
AND THE TYPE OF METRICS WE MAY

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:00.868
WANT TO BE TRYING TO ALSO

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:03.170
ACHIEVED SO THAT THEN IF WE

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:04.438
ENDED UP.

01:34:04.505 --> 01:34:07.274
ENGAGING SOME EXTERNAL PARTNERS

01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:10.678
TO PILOT THIS AS WE DO THIS

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:11.679
TRANSITION.

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.214
IT IT'S BENEFICIAL BOTH IN THE

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.849
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR TRAINING IN

01:34:14.915 --> 01:34:18.052
IN MULTIPLE WAYS -- SO I I THINK

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:21.155
IT IS WORTH IT. TO TO ALSO

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.390
CONSIDER DOING THAT.

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:24.825
AND THAT'S NOT PART OF THE

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:26.060
TRAILER BILL RIGHT NOW BUT I

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.528
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:29.030
WITH.

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:31.065
THE DEPARTMENT AND DIVISION AND

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:32.233
THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT AN OVER

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:38.372
WHETHER THERE'S OPENNESS TO THAT --

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:41.042
YEAH AND THOSE ARE SOME OF MY

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:43.411
THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW. ONE HOW WE

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:45.746
MIGHT PROCEED IN ADDITION TO

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:48.282
WHAT YOU'VE PUT BEFORE US.

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:49.984
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WANTS TO

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:53.487
MAKE ANY COMMENT TO THAT OR THE

01:34:53.554 --> 01:34:56.123
LA NUMBERS.

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:58.626
OKAY FOR YES SO IN LOS ANGELES

01:34:58.692 --> 01:34:59.093
IS [inaudible]

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.128
ONE THERE ARE.

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:02.630
THIS IS FOR THEIR COUNTY

THIRTY EIGHT TOTAL BEDS.

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:10.604
AND THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.440
AND SEVENTY NINE USED IN THEM.

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:14.875
WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S ONLY 24%

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:15.576
FALL.

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:17.578
AND THERE'S A TWO THOUSAND SIX

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:19.747

NOT TO ARGUE.

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:36.130

ABLE TO WORKACROSS PERCEIVED

01:36:58.312 --> 01:36:59.280
DIFFERENCES AND CERTAINLY ITSELF

01:36:59.346 --> 01:37:00.114
FUNDAMENTAL.

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:01.615
YOU KNOW NEED FOR A USED TO

01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:02.316

GROUP THAT THEY BELONG.

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:10.858

OTHER BEING SUCCESSFUL HAVING A

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:21.402

FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WE DO SUPPORT

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:31.785
THE MOVE A DJ INTO THE

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:33.186
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:34.821
SERVICES.

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:37.023
THAT SAID WE WE DO NOT BELIEVE

01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:38.759
THAT THE CULTURE OF NORMALCY

01:46:38.825 --> 01:46:40.761
THAT MR SUPPLE SO ELOQUENTLY

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:41.928
DESCRIBED.

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:43.163
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT CULTURE OF

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:44.931
NORMALCY CAN BE CREATEDIN THE

01:46:44.998 --> 01:46:46.633
CURRENT PHYSICAL BUILDINGS THAT

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.869
DJ USES AND WE DON'T BELIEVE

01:46:48.935 --> 01:46:50.837
THAT THE MISERY MODEL CAN BE

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:52.405
IMPLEMENTED IN THOSE STRUCTURES.

01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:53.774
THEY ARE JUST PRISON LIKE THEY

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.408
ARE PRISONS.

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:56.977
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE VISION

01:46:57.043 --> 01:46:58.712
THAT MR SUPPLE PUTS FORWARD OF A

01:46:58.779 --> 01:46:59.946
CULTURE OF NORMALCY IN A

01:47:00.013 --> 01:47:01.748
THERAPEUTIC APPROACHTO THE WORK

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:02.282
IS.

01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:03.850
A GREAT VISION AND TO ACTUALLY

01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:06.386
IMPLEMENT THAT WE NEED TO MOVE

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:07.921
TO DIFFERENT PHYSICAL STRUCTURES

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:09.790
CLOSER TO COMMUNITY SMALLER

01:47:09.856 --> 01:47:11.291
NUMBER OF YOUTH BEING HELD

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:11.825
TOGETHER.

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:14.895
IN A WAY WHERE THEIR FAMILIES

01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:16.329
CAN BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED.

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:17.631
WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:19.032
ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:20.834
YOUTH BEING SENT TO DJ NOW AND

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.402
TO NOT.

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:24.204
ACCEPT WITHOUT QUESTIONING THAT

01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:25.872
THESE ARE THE WORST OF THE WORST

01:47:25.939 --> 01:47:27.040
YOUTH AS I'VE HEARD THEM

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:28.341
DESCRIBED THIS MORNING.

01:47:28.408 --> 01:47:30.410
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COUNTY

01:47:30.477 --> 01:47:32.612
DISPARITIES IN WHO IS BEING SENT

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:34.848
TO DJJ AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:36.650
THE USE OF SACRAMENTO ARE WORSE

01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:37.551
THAN THE YOUTH OF THEIR

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:38.652
NEIGHBORING COUNTY.

01:47:38.718 --> 01:47:40.687
SAN JOAQUIN I THINK WE NEED TO

01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:42.722
ASK WHY ARE SOME COUNTIES

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:44.391
SENDING USED TO DJJ IN OTHER

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:45.692
COUNTIES OR NOT.

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:48.328
AND WHAT IS IT WE CAN PROVIDE.

01:47:48.395 --> 01:47:50.297
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO FIX THAT

01:47:50.363 --> 01:47:52.332
PROBLEM SO THAT IN EVERY COUNTY

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:55.936
THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES FOR EVERY

01:47:56.002 --> 01:47:58.605

JUVENILE COURT JUDGES.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.821
THEY TEND TO BE JUDGES WHO DO

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:16.790
NOT CYCLE THROUGH ASSIGNMENTS AS

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:18.792
ROUTINELY AS OTHERS THEY ARE SO

01:48:18.859 --> 01:48:20.961
THEY ARE DEDICATED TO JUVENILE

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:22.662
JUSTICE AND TND TO STAY IN

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:24.064

A CRIMINAL JUSTICE MODEL TO A

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:39.212
REHABILITATIVE MODEL -- OUR

01:48:39.279 --> 01:48:40.914
JUDGES DON'T AT ALL -- MINIMIZE

01:48:40.981 --> 01:48:43.016

IN SUPPORT BUT HOPE THAT THAT.

01:49:04.004 --> 01:49:05.639
THIS ISN'T JUST THE END OF THE

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:08.308
DISCUSSION BUT AN IMPETUS FOR

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:10.076
GREATER TRANSFORMATION THE

01:49:10.143 --> 01:49:11.411
CURRENT LACK OF OVERSIGHT.

01:49:11.478 --> 01:49:12.946
CORONATIONS BETWEEN OUR YOUTH

01:49:13.013 --> 01:49:15.081
SERVING SYSTEMS MEANS THAT OUR

01:49:15.148 --> 01:49:16.816
YOUTH ARE RECEIVING.

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:18.385
POOR SERVICES FOR AN

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:20.353
EXTRAORDINARY PRICE AND AT THE

01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.989
END OF THE DAY WE BELIEVE THAT.

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:24.724
WE HAVE COMMUNITIES WE HAVE

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:26.693

STATE.

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:35.402
WHO HAVE INSIDE AND WE WOULD

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:37.938
STRONGLY RECOMMEND CREATING A

FORMALIZED AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:42.275

01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:43.977
ADDITIONALLY AS WE SEEM TO ME

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:44.544
BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE

01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:46.212
BENEFITS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE

01:49:46.279 --> 01:49:47.580

PLANNING NEEDS TO HAPPEN THE

01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:52.852
SECOND THAT THIS COMES IN.

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:54.587
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:56.122
HAVE YOUTH WHO ARE SO FAR AWAY

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:57.958
FROM THEIR FAMILIES SO FAR AWAY

01:49:58.024 --> 01:49:59.559
FROM THE COMMUNITIES.

01:49:59.626 --> 01:50:01.928
THAT BRIDGE CAN'T BE BUILT IN A

01:50:01.995 --> 01:50:04.097
WAY THAT IS TRULY SUPPORTIVE TO

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:05.598
ENSURE THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:08.301
HAVE A CHANCE TO BECOME.

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:09.769
PART OF THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:50:09.836 --> 01:50:11.938
LEADERS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:13.206
THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO SO.

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:16.509
THANK YOU.

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:17.911

WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MOVE --

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:25.385
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:27.387
LONG TIME COMING AND WE TOTALLY.

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:29.255
AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:30.924
CULTURE CHANGE WILL BE IMPORTANT

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:32.492
BUT WE ALSO HOPE THAT IN THIS

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:34.227
BUDGET CYCLE.

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.495
THE LEGISLATURE WILL WILL

01:50:35.562 --> 01:50:37.230
ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR TO DO

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:40.133
SOMETHING MORE WITH THIS -- DJJ

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.569
IS JUST A SMALL PART OF THE

01:50:42.635 --> 01:50:43.703
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:45.605
WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THAT WHAT'S

01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:47.607
BEEN SAID BEFORE THE QUESTIONS

01:50:47.674 --> 01:50:48.174
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT

01:50:48.241 --> 01:50:49.109
WHETHER.

01:50:49.175 --> 01:50:51.044
THE SYSTEM SHOULD CONTINUE IN

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.445
ITS PRESENT INSTITUTIONAL FORM

01:50:52.512 --> 01:50:54.414
THOSE ARE REALLY EXCELLENT

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:55.949
QUESTIONS AND WE HOPE THAT

01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:57.384
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS.

01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:59.052

WOULD WORK BETTER FOR SERVING

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:16.002
THIS POPULATION AND WE ALSO

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:18.338
THINK THAT THE AGENCY IF IT'S

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:20.440
TRULY TO BE. TO TO FULFILL THE

01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:22.342
GOVERNOR'S IDEA OF TRANSFORMING

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:24.377
JUVENILE JUSTICE WE NEED TO LOOK

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:25.779
AT THE REST OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:27.447

MEASUREMENT -- A CREATING A TASK

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:04.551
FORCE OR ADVISORY GROUP THAT

01:52:04.617 --> 01:52:06.653
WOULD HAVE SOME MORE FORMAL ROLE

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:09.255
IN WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:52:09.322 --> 01:52:11.691

AND SO WE HOPE THAT THE

01:52:18.665 --> 01:52:20.200
COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT THAT

01:52:20.266 --> 01:52:20.834

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:21.034
THIS.

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:22.802
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

CRIMINAL JUSTICE.

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:28.608
WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE

01:52:28.675 --> 01:52:31.978
PROPOSAL -- TO MOVE DJJ OUT OF

01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:33.146
THE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT AND

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:34.914
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:38.318
BUT WITH CONCERN THAT AT NAME

01:52:38.384 --> 01:52:39.452
CHANGE ALONE.

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:41.988
WILL NOT DELIVER BETTER OUTCOMES

01:52:42.055 --> 01:52:43.890
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OR THEIR

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:44.891
COMMUNITIES.

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:46.326
WE RESERVE RECENTLY RELEASED A

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:48.828
REPORT -- LOOKING AT CONDITIONS

LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

01:52:52.499 --> 01:52:54.534
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT --

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:57.170
THEY REMAIN FUNDAMENTALLY ON

01:52:57.237 --> 01:52:59.672
SAFE AND NON REHABILITATIVE.

01:52:59.739 --> 01:53:02.942
BECAUSE OF FACTORS THAT ARE

01:53:03.009 --> 01:53:04.677
ENDEMIC TO CONGREGATE

01:53:04.744 --> 01:53:07.447
INSTITUTIONS THEY'RE LARGE THE

01:53:07.514 --> 01:53:09.315
PRISON LIKE AND THEY'RE FAR FROM

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:11.784
FAMILIES.

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:13.520
AND THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOU

01:53:13.586 --> 01:53:15.488
SIMPLY FARE BETTER WHEN THEY'RE

01:53:15.555 --> 01:53:17.023
IN SMALLER SETTINGS THAT ARE

01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:18.224
CLOSER TO HOME WHERE THEY CAN

01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:20.260
MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH COMMUNITY

01:53:20.326 --> 01:53:21.661
BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:24.564

TOWARDS WHAT WE KNOW WORKS

01:53:30.937 --> 01:53:34.307
SMALLER COMMUNITY BASED OPTIONS.

01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:36.709
THAT ARE CLOSER TO THE COMMUNITY --

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:38.244

01:53:50.423 --> 01:53:51.391
CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:52.792

HI MY NAME'S CLEAR BOUNDARY I

01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:36.015
WAS HERE -- I WASN'T SEE WAY

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:37.917
WHEN IT FIRST BEGAN ITS NAME

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:40.019
CHANGE TO DJJ.

01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:41.421
AND NOTHING.

01:57:41.487 --> 01:57:42.822
REALLY CHANGED IN WITH THIS NAME

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:43.856

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:45.391
PROBLEMS THAT I SAW THEY'RE

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:46.192
CHANGING.

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:47.827
IT DOES I HOPE THAT THIS IS THE

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:49.395
FIRST STEP TO DISSOLUTION BACK

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:51.063
DOWN TO A COUNTY LEVEL AND

01:57:51.130 --> 01:57:52.865
PERHAPS THE JUVENILES TO FEEL

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:54.300
SILLY THESE THERE COULD.

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:56.135
YOU KNOW GO UP TO TWENTY FIVE

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.603
YEARS OF AGE AS C. WAY DOES.

01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:58.304
THE PROBLEMS THAT I SAW THERE

01:57:58.371 --> 01:58:02.375
WERE -- BEFORE I EVEN WHEN THEY

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:03.776
TOLD ME THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE.

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:04.977
POINTLESS AND IN FACT HORRIFIC

01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:06.446
AND SO I GOT MY GED BEFORE I

01:58:06.512 --> 01:58:07.747
WENT THERE AND I GOT INTO A

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:08.881
BUNCH OF OCCASIONAL PROGRAMS%

01:58:08.948 --> 01:58:10.450
WHICH ARE STILL DRAWN TO THIS

01:58:10.516 --> 01:58:11.717
DAY.

01:58:11.784 --> 01:58:16.622
THEN THE LAST -- YOU KNOW WITH.

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:18.691
THE STAFF THERE'S JUST

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:19.325
RETRAINING THEM ISN'T GOING TO

01:58:19.392 --> 01:58:20.226
HELP.

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:21.360
HOW THEY VIEW US I MEAN IT

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:23.229
DOESN'T CHANGE WHO THEY ARE AND

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:23.863
THERE AND SOME OF THEM WERE JUST

01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:24.831
NEGATIVE?

01:58:24.897 --> 01:58:27.099
AND TO BE JUST A NEGATIVE PERSON

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:28.167
AROUND KIDS IS.

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:29.402
YOU KNOW NOT HELPING THEM AT ALL

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:31.003
AND NO AMOUNT OF TRAINING IS

01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:32.338
GOING TO CHANGE THAT.

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:34.240
SO THE STAFF NEEDS TO REALLY BE

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:36.008
REEVALUATED ALL TOGETHER ON WHO

01:58:36.075 --> 01:58:37.310
CAN WORK WITH KIDS AND WHO'S

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:38.945
GOING TO BE HELPFUL WHEN THEY

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:41.314
WORK WITH THE CHILDREN.

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.248
THE LAST [inaudible]

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:43.049

AGE OF SIXTEEN OR AYE SIR TWENTY

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:56.349

02:00:56.415 --> 02:00:58.351
EXPERIENCES FROM THAT KNOWLEDGE

02:00:58.417 --> 02:00:59.652
ON THIS ISSUE -- AND I

02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:10.863
BUT I THINK IN CALIFORNIA HERE

02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:12.698
ARE THE CONVERSATIONS WERE

02:01:12.765 --> 02:01:15.201
HAVING WE HAVE LEADERSHIP -- TO

02:01:15.267 --> 02:01:17.069
CREATE A ROLE MODEL RIGHT TO FIX

02:01:17.136 --> 02:01:18.671
CALIFORNIA.

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:19.572

THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:23.576
THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:25.544
TO DJJ SYSTEM TO SEE WHAT A

02:01:25.611 --> 02:01:26.512
SYSTEM.

02:01:26.579 --> 02:01:27.380
CORRECTION SYSTEMS AT A YOUNG

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:30.683
AGE -- WE ARE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO

02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:32.084
THE PROBLEM AND ONE OF THE

02:01:32.151 --> 02:01:33.619
THINGS THAT I BELIEVE IN IS THAT

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:35.187
WE ALSO CLOSEST TO LUCIEN TO THE

02:01:35.254 --> 02:01:36.055
SOLUTION.

DOESN'T EXCLUDE EVERYBODY ELSE

02:01:37.657 --> 02:01:39.859
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES --

02:01:39.925 --> 02:01:41.761
THE ALL WE SEEN WHEN IT COMES TO

02:01:41.827 --> 02:01:43.996

02:01:54.306 --> 02:01:55.441
THOSE ARE ALSO THE REYES CONSOLE

02:01:55.508 --> 02:01:56.142

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:20.646

THEY'VE ALSO ADOPTED OUR

02:10:24.983 --> 02:10:26.919

02:10:32.057 --> 02:10:33.192
THE TRAINING AT THE INSTITUTION

02:10:33.258 --> 02:10:35.160

THE DEPARTMENT HAS ACCEPTED THAT --

02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:44.002
I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD CONSIDER A

02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:45.103
RECOMMENDATION FOR AUDIO

02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:46.772

INTERVIEWS -- WE FOUND.

02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:08.360
A LOT OF IRREGULARITIES AND HOW

02:11:08.427 --> 02:11:09.962
THE INTERVIEWS WERE DONE AND

02:11:10.028 --> 02:11:12.931
AGAIN IF WE HADN'T BEEN THERE.

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:14.099
NOBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN.

02:11:14.166 --> 02:11:16.335
OF THE PROPOSAL IS SET FORTH BY

02:11:16.401 --> 02:11:17.603
THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES FOR NO

02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:19.538
INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF

02:11:19.605 --> 02:11:20.772

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:24.910

02:11:44.696 --> 02:11:45.397
BEEN ENGAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT

THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO SEE IF THE

WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT YOU NEED

02:23:11.215 --> 02:23:13.184

MORE EMPLOYEES.

02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:58.830

02:28:26.697 --> 02:28:28.532
WE DO THAT -- ONE OF OUR

02:28:28.599 --> 02:28:31.002
MANDATES IS TO YEARLY TO AN

THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND IN

02:28:35.206 --> 02:28:37.575
THE PAST YEAR AND PROVIDE THAT

02:28:37.642 --> 02:28:40.678
KIND OF INFORMATION -- I THINK

02:28:40.745 --> 02:28:42.079
MY PREDECESSOR GONE AWAY FROM

02:28:42.146 --> 02:28:46.584

02:28:57.762 --> 02:28:58.829
ARE YOU SAVING THE STATE

02:28:58.896 --> 02:29:00.564
MULTIPLES OF YOUR DEPARTMENT

02:29:00.631 --> 02:29:03.768
COSTS BY BELIEVE SO YES SO.

02:29:03.834 --> 02:29:06.203
I THINK  IT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE

02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:07.872
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DID

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:09.073
THIS REPORT.

02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:13.244
WAS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT AND

02:29:13.311 --> 02:29:15.079
THE PRISON LAW OFFICE HAD COME

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:17.648

02:29:17.715 --> 02:29:20.718

AND I WAS INVITED INTO A

02:29:23.587 --> 02:29:25.589
CONVERSATION WITH -- THE

02:29:25.656 --> 02:29:27.325
SECRETARY TO TIMES COCHRAN AND

02:29:27.391 --> 02:29:29.827
DON SPECTER OF THE PLO THEY WERE

02:29:29.894 --> 02:29:30.428
MEETING THEY ASKED ME TO COME

02:29:30.494 --> 02:29:31.228
OVER.

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:33.497
AND DON WAS.

02:29:33.564 --> 02:29:35.499
GETTING READY TO FILE A CLASS

02:29:35.566 --> 02:29:37.835
ACTION LAWSUIT ON THE APPEALS

02:29:37.902 --> 02:29:40.137
PROCESS.

02:29:40.204 --> 02:29:43.140
AND SCOTT ASKED ME TO TAKE A

02:29:43.207 --> 02:29:44.809
LOOK AT IT WOULD WE BE WILLING

02:29:44.875 --> 02:29:46.410
IF THEY INVITED US IN BECAUSE I

02:29:46.477 --> 02:29:47.445
DON'T HAVE ANY JURISDICTION TO

02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:49.046
DO THAT WOULD WE BE WILLING TO

02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:50.481

WE AGREED TO DO THAT.

02:29:56.454 --> 02:29:58.789
I THINK AS A RESULT OF THAT PLO

02:29:58.856 --> 02:30:02.193
BACKED OFF OF THEIR PLANNED

02:30:02.259 --> 02:30:05.129

THE ATTORNEYS FEES PROBABLY

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:11.869
EXCEED WHAT OUR BUDGET IS.

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:15.373
SO THEN -- IT IT SEEMS TO ME

02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:17.308
THAT THE SECRETARY AND YOU

02:30:17.375 --> 02:30:18.809

02:34:43.674 --> 02:34:44.675
RELATIONSHIP.

02:34:44.742 --> 02:34:47.144
BUT IF WE THINK THAT THE PURPOSE

02:34:47.211 --> 02:34:51.081
OF IT WAS TO GIVE TO CREATE AN

02:34:51.148 --> 02:34:52.416
ENTITY THAT REALLY HAD THE IN.

02:34:52.483 --> 02:34:54.985
INDEPENDENCE TO DO THAT KIND OF

02:34:55.052 --> 02:34:59.356
REVIEW FOR US BECAUSE WE WERE.

02:34:59.423 --> 02:34:59.957
JUST LIKE WHY WE HAVE A STATE

02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:00.591
AUDITOR.

02:35:00.658 --> 02:35:02.593
IS NONE OF US ARE PERFECT AND IT

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:03.927
ISN'T EVEN AN ASSUMPTION THAT

02:35:03.994 --> 02:35:06.630
ANY AGENCY IS TRYING TO HIDE

02:35:06.697 --> 02:35:07.598
ANYTHING IT'S MORE THAT.

02:35:07.665 --> 02:35:10.067
WE WE BECOME PART OF THE CULTURE

02:35:10.134 --> 02:35:12.703
OF OUR OF OUR OPERATIONS IN IT'S

02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:15.005
SOMETIMES HARDER FOR US TO SEE

02:35:15.072 --> 02:35:16.707
WHEN THERE ARE FLAWS.

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:19.143
AND SO FOR ME WHEN I READ THIS

02:35:19.209 --> 02:35:20.210
REPORT.

02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:22.212
I THUGHT WHOA.

02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:25.315
THIS THE NOT JUST THAT SOME OF

02:35:25.382 --> 02:35:27.184
THE COMPLAINT PROCESS SEES WERE

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:28.919
REALLY IN ADEQUATE.

02:35:28.986 --> 02:35:30.220
BUT THAT.

02:35:30.287 --> 02:35:31.922
WE DO WE NO LONGER HAD A

02:35:31.989 --> 02:35:33.190
SITUATION.

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:34.725
WHERE OUR OFFICE OF INSPECTOR

02:35:34.792 --> 02:35:36.360
GENERAL?

02:35:36.427 --> 02:35:37.895
COULD GET THE INFORMATION HAT

02:35:37.961 --> 02:35:39.596
IT NEEDED.

02:35:39.663 --> 02:35:41.331
OR COMPEL CERTAIN TYPE OF

02:35:41.398 --> 02:35:43.167
CHANGES AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW

02:35:43.233 --> 02:35:44.902
WE SHOULD REVISIT THAT WE SHOULD

02:35:44.968 --> 02:35:46.704
REALLY LOOK AT IT NOWTHE BCP

02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:48.972
BEFORE US.

02:35:49.039 --> 02:35:51.742
DOES NOT INCLUDE RESTORING SOME

02:35:51.809 --> 02:35:53.377
OF THE AUTHORITY THAT THE

02:35:53.444 --> 02:35:54.678
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE

02:35:54.745 --> 02:35:56.680
ORIGINALLY HAD BUT FOR EXAMPLE

02:35:56.747 --> 02:35:59.083
THE ORIGINAL STATUTE INCLUDED A

02:35:59.149 --> 02:35:59.616
MANDATE.

02:35:59.683 --> 02:36:01.418
THAT THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR

02:36:01.485 --> 02:36:03.620
GENERAL COULD INDEPENDENTLY CAN

02:36:03.687 --> 02:36:05.756
CHECK NOT QUITE IN FAMILIES

02:36:05.823 --> 02:36:06.590
STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME APPROVAL

02:36:06.657 --> 02:36:09.660
BUT AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS.

02:36:09.727 --> 02:36:12.596
AND WAS OUR REQUIREMENT THAT THE

02:36:12.663 --> 02:36:13.864
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:15.933
CONDUCT FACILITY OPERATION

02:36:15.999 --> 02:36:18.402
REVIEWS SO THERE WERE VERY S.

02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:20.270
BUT THE WARRANTIES THAT THE

02:36:20.337 --> 02:36:22.139
OFFICE USED TO HAVE.

02:36:22.206 --> 02:36:24.174
IN BY BEING THAT IT WOULD BE

02:36:24.241 --> 02:36:26.744
VERY WELL WORTH OUR WHILE.

02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:28.278
TO CONSIDER WHICH ONES WE SHOULD

02:36:28.345 --> 02:36:31.014
BE THINKING OF TO RESTORE.

02:36:31.081 --> 02:36:33.150
SO THAT WE HAVE THE TYPE OF

02:36:33.217 --> 02:36:34.685
INDEPENDENCE.

02:36:34.752 --> 02:36:36.820
THAT WE WOULD WANT.

02:36:36.887 --> 02:36:39.790
AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I AM

02:36:39.857 --> 02:36:40.991
VERY INTERESTED IN.

02:36:41.058 --> 02:36:43.127
IN -- IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

02:36:43.193 --> 02:36:44.661
I'M RECOMMENDING THAT WE HOLD

02:36:44.728 --> 02:36:46.697
THE ITEM OPEN SO THAT WE CAN

02:36:46.764 --> 02:36:49.199
TALK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT.

02:36:49.266 --> 02:36:50.667
THOSE POSSIBILITIES.

02:36:50.734 --> 02:36:52.836
AND ALSO SO WE CAN SEE IF

02:36:52.903 --> 02:36:56.140
THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL TWEAKING

02:36:56.206 --> 02:36:59.443
TO THE RECOMMENDED -- COMPLAINT

02:36:59.510 --> 02:37:01.311
REVIEW CHANGES OUR COMPLAINT

02:37:01.378 --> 02:37:02.846
PROCESS CHANGES.

02:37:02.913 --> 02:37:04.848
IN THERE ARE I DID SEE THAT

02:37:04.915 --> 02:37:06.683
THERE DEFINITELY IMPROVEMENTS IN

02:37:06.750 --> 02:37:08.318
TERMS OF WHAT CDC ARE IS

02:37:08.385 --> 02:37:11.889
RECOMMENDING -- BUT I'VE.

02:37:11.955 --> 02:37:18.262
BUT INDEPENDENTLY I HAD NOTED.

02:37:18.328 --> 02:37:19.329
THAT THERE WERE.

02:37:19.396 --> 02:37:19.930
IN THE FLOW CHART.

02:37:19.997 --> 02:37:20.798
THE ISSUE OF SEPARATE PROCESS

02:37:20.864 --> 02:37:23.367
SEES FOR SPECIAL GRIEVANCES.

02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:26.303
SEEM -- TO I WASN'T SURE REALLY

02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:28.238
THE BENEFIT OF THAT.

02:37:28.305 --> 02:37:30.841
AND THERE WERE JUST SOME

02:37:30.908 --> 02:37:32.876
QUESTIONS LIKE THAT WHICH BEFORE

02:37:32.943 --> 02:37:34.511
I'D EVEN ASK THEM.

02:37:34.578 --> 02:37:35.546
THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR

02:37:35.612 --> 02:37:36.847
GENERAL RAISE SOME OF THOSE

02:37:36.914 --> 02:37:38.849
ISSUES SO I THINK IT'S WORTH IT

02:37:38.916 --> 02:37:40.517
FOR US TO LOOK AT THAT A LITTLE

02:37:40.584 --> 02:37:42.586
MORE AND ALSO LOOK AT WHETHER WE

02:37:42.653 --> 02:37:43.453
WANT.

02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:45.722
TO RESTORE A FEW OF THESE --

02:37:45.789 --> 02:37:47.724
MANDATES THAT WERE IN THE

02:37:47.791 --> 02:37:50.961
ORIGINAL STATUTE [inaudible]

02:37:51.028 --> 02:37:55.699
LA OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE

02:37:55.766 --> 02:37:56.733

02:37:56.800 --> 02:37:59.403
PROPOSAL -- KAELIN O'NEILL AT

02:37:59.469 --> 02:38:01.538
THE LA OKAY AT WE WE RAISE TWO

02:38:01.605 --> 02:38:03.407
CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE

02:38:03.473 --> 02:38:04.775
FIRST IS WHAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

02:38:04.842 --> 02:38:06.310
THAT'S BEING REQUESTED.

02:38:06.376 --> 02:38:08.445
AND WE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL

02:38:08.512 --> 02:38:10.347
WOULD REDUCE WORKLOAD FOR PRISON

02:38:10.414 --> 02:38:11.648
BASED STAFF THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:38:11.715 --> 02:38:12.716
TASKED WITH.

02:38:12.783 --> 02:38:14.384
DOING ENQUIRIES INTO STAFF

02:38:14.451 --> 02:38:16.086
COMPLAINTS AND BY SHIFTING THAT

02:38:16.153 --> 02:38:17.654
WORKLOAD TO THESE NEW REGIONAL

02:38:17.721 --> 02:38:19.356
TEAMS UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE

02:38:19.423 --> 02:38:21.792
TURN INTERNAL AFFAIRS -- THE

02:38:21.859 --> 02:38:24.294
PROPOSAL WOULD -- WORK AT REDUCE

02:38:24.361 --> 02:38:25.362
AS I SAID WORKLOAD FOR THOSE

02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:27.931
PRISON MAY STAFF AND WHAT WE

02:38:27.998 --> 02:38:29.633
THINK WHEN I SHOP IN THE FORM OF

02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:31.101
REDUCED.

02:38:31.168 --> 02:38:33.904
OVERTIME SPENDING AND SO WE

02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:36.974
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE --

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:38.408
REDUCE THE REQUESTED FUNDING

02:38:38.475 --> 02:38:40.210
AMOUNT AND IF THE LEGISLATURE

02:38:40.277 --> 02:38:41.144
WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IN THAT

02:38:41.211 --> 02:38:42.479
DIRECTION WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK

02:38:42.546 --> 02:38:43.647
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:47.918
ESTIMATE A REASONABLE SAVINGS

02:38:47.985 --> 02:38:48.919
AMOUNT.

02:38:48.986 --> 02:38:50.087
OUR SECOND AREA OF CONCERN WHICH

02:38:50.153 --> 02:38:50.621
HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TO SOME

02:38:50.687 --> 02:38:51.388
DEGREE IS THE LACK OF DETAIL

02:38:51.455 --> 02:38:52.990
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN

02:38:53.056 --> 02:38:54.424
TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT.

02:38:54.491 --> 02:38:57.427
OF THE NEW INCREASE PROCESS AND

02:38:57.494 --> 02:38:59.763
OUR AIR OUR CONCERNS FELL INTO

02:38:59.830 --> 02:39:01.765
THREE AREAS EXPERTISE

02:39:01.832 --> 02:39:04.167
INDEPENDENCE AND TRANSPARENCY.

02:39:04.234 --> 02:39:06.637
ON THE ISSUE OF EXPERT EXPERTISE.

02:39:06.703 --> 02:39:07.838
THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE

02:39:07.905 --> 02:39:09.506
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS WHAT

02:39:09.573 --> 02:39:11.275
TYPE OF OVERSIGHT WOULD LIKE TO

02:39:11.341 --> 02:39:13.277
HAVE PROVIDED OVER THIS PROCESS.

02:39:13.343 --> 02:39:15.479
AND DOES THE ENTITY OR ENTITIES

02:39:15.545 --> 02:39:17.381
BEING TASKED WITH THAT HAVE THE

02:39:17.447 --> 02:39:19.182
NECESSARY EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE

02:39:19.249 --> 02:39:21.151
THAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT -- FOR

02:39:21.218 --> 02:39:22.352
EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:23.553
PROPOSING TO HAVE THE OFFICE OF

02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:24.788
AUDIT AND AUDITS IN COURT

02:39:24.855 --> 02:39:26.690
COMPLIANCE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF

02:39:26.757 --> 02:39:27.791
THE NEW PROCESS.

02:39:27.858 --> 02:39:29.760
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

02:39:29.826 --> 02:39:31.228
OVERSIGHT WOULD TAKE THE FORM

02:39:31.295 --> 02:39:33.463
PRIMARILY OF DATA ANALYTICS

02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:35.198
WHICH THE STAFF IN THAT OFFICE

02:39:35.265 --> 02:39:36.667
MAY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO

02:39:36.733 --> 02:39:53.050
PROVIDE HOWEVER

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:50.367
GAINES.

02:41:50.434 --> 02:41:51.535
AYE THOSE DUTIES WERE ASSIGNED

02:41:51.601 --> 02:41:53.136
TO A GENERAL -- SERGEANTS AND

02:41:53.203 --> 02:41:54.104
LIEUTENANTS WITHIN THE

02:41:54.171 --> 02:41:55.806
INSTITUTION KIND OF AS AND OTHER

02:41:55.872 --> 02:41:57.607
DUTIES ASSIGNED THERE WEREN'T

02:41:57.674 --> 02:41:58.842
SPECIFIC TEAM SET OUT FOR THIS.

02:41:58.909 --> 02:42:01.011
SO THE CHANGES IN REDUCTION ON

02:42:01.078 --> 02:42:02.245
THE IT'LL INSTITUTIONS THAT

02:42:02.312 --> 02:42:04.047
WOULD LIKELY BE VERY MARGINAL

02:42:04.114 --> 02:42:05.415
AND IT'S AN AS THE INSPECTOR

02:42:05.482 --> 02:42:06.917
GENERAL NOTED A LOT OF THOSE

02:42:06.983 --> 02:42:08.385
COMPLAINTS WERE HANDLED IN

02:42:08.452 --> 02:42:09.486
ADEQUATELY ANSWERED.

02:42:09.553 --> 02:42:11.254
IDENTIFYING A TIMER SAVINGS

02:42:11.321 --> 02:42:13.056
ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING THOSE

02:42:13.123 --> 02:42:15.692
COMPLAINTS OUT OF THE

02:42:15.759 --> 02:42:16.226
INSTITUTIONS IS IT'S VERY

02:42:16.293 --> 02:42:19.329
DIFFICULT.

02:42:19.396 --> 02:42:19.930
ON THAT ONE NIGHT I CAN IN.

02:42:19.996 --> 02:42:22.065
SO IN GENERAL I'M ALWAYS LOOKING

02:42:22.132 --> 02:42:23.867
FOR SAVINGS SAVINGS IN THE WAYS

02:42:23.934 --> 02:42:24.468
TO ABSORB BUT I CAN IMAGINE IF

02:42:24.534 --> 02:42:28.305
WE IF WE WANT AN IMPROVED.

02:42:28.371 --> 02:42:31.108
COMPLAINT PROCESS WITH -- I MEAN

02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:33.710
NOW WE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE THE

02:42:33.777 --> 02:42:34.644
COMPLAINTS ARE BEING

02:42:34.711 --> 02:42:36.546
INVESTIGATED.

02:42:36.613 --> 02:42:40.150
BY IT AS STAFF MEMBER WHO.

02:42:40.217 --> 02:42:42.752
WHO REPORTED TO THE PERSON WHO?

02:42:42.819 --> 02:42:43.887
HAD IT WOULD THE COMPLAINT WAS

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:46.756
ISSUED AGAINST I MEAN WHAT KIND

02:42:46.823 --> 02:42:49.826
OF THAT IS. TO MEAN THAT JUST.

02:42:49.893 --> 02:42:52.462
DOES NOT WORK SO.

02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:55.365
BY THE BY CAN SEE WHERE THERE

02:42:55.432 --> 02:42:56.900
MAY BE RESOURCES REQUIRED IN

02:42:56.967 --> 02:42:59.002
ORDER TO ACHIEVE A AN

02:42:59.069 --> 02:43:00.871
APPROPRIATE COMPLAINT PROCESS

02:43:00.937 --> 02:43:01.738
BUT I CERTAINLY THINK SOME OF

02:43:01.805 --> 02:43:03.106
THE OTHER.

02:43:03.173 --> 02:43:06.510
ISSUES THAT ELIO RACED -- ARE

02:43:06.576 --> 02:43:07.544

ONCE INCARCERATED.

02:51:29.178 --> 02:51:30.346
CONSEQUENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION

02:51:30.413 --> 02:51:32.582
IS REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED

02:51:32.649 --> 02:51:33.149

REVISE THIS COMPLEX STATUTORY

02:51:42.158 --> 02:51:43.493
STRUCTURE.

02:51:43.559 --> 02:51:44.427
THE NEW COMMITTEE WILL HAVE

02:51:44.494 --> 02:51:46.229
SEPARATE POWERS TO MAKE POLICIES

02:51:46.295 --> 02:51:47.697
AND TAKE THAT ACTION SEPARATE

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:51.034
FROM THE COMMISSION INTERVIEW

REVISIONS TO THE PENAL CODE.

02:51:54.637 --> 02:51:55.471
THE COMMITTEE WILL BEGIN AN

02:51:55.538 --> 02:51:56.906
EFFORT TO SIMPLIFY AND

02:51:56.973 --> 02:51:58.074
RATIONALIZE CRIMINAL LONG

ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION

02:52:01.911 --> 02:52:04.213
THAT AID REHABILITATION AND

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:05.515
PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:52:05.581 --> 02:52:07.316
IMPROVE PAROLE AND PROBATION

02:52:07.383 --> 02:52:08.851

02:52:10.153 --> 02:52:11.454
CONSIDERATIONS.

02:52:11.521 --> 02:52:12.989
THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING

02:52:13.056 --> 02:52:14.424
FOR TWO ATTORNEY POSITIONS AND

02:52:14.490 --> 02:52:15.558
ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION

02:52:15.625 --> 02:52:17.527
ASSOCIATED COST WE ARE ALSO

02:52:17.593 --> 02:52:19.195
PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

02:52:19.262 --> 02:52:20.997
TO ESTABLISH THE COMMITTEE.

02:52:21.064 --> 02:52:22.231
AND THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES

02:52:22.298 --> 02:52:30.139
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

02:52:30.206 --> 02:52:32.542
IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR US TO READ

02:52:32.608 --> 02:52:40.349
REPORTS LET ALONE THE ANYWAY --

02:52:40.416 --> 02:52:41.651
A I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A

02:52:41.718 --> 02:52:43.953
PROBLEM WITH REVIEWING THAT IN

02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:46.255
CREATING AN ENTITY TO PREVIEW IT

02:52:46.322 --> 02:52:48.391
MY ONE ISSUE WOULD BE THE

02:52:48.458 --> 02:52:52.595
COMPOSITION YOU RECOMMEND OR

02:52:52.662 --> 02:52:54.030
RATHER THE PROPOSAL.

02:52:54.097 --> 02:52:54.964
SAYS ONE SENATE MEMBER ONE

02:52:55.031 --> 02:52:56.165
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND FIVE

02:52:56.232 --> 02:52:58.301
APPOINTEES FROM THE GOVERNOR.

02:52:58.367 --> 02:53:01.571
A COURSE -- AS LEGISLATORS --

02:53:01.637 --> 02:53:03.673
YOU KNOW THAT THE A LITTLE BIT

02:53:03.740 --> 02:53:03.973
[inaudible]

02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:09.812
S. Q. -- BUT CAN A JUSTIFICATION

02:53:09.879 --> 02:53:12.882
BESIDES THAT YOU MAY WANT TO

02:53:12.949 --> 02:53:14.717
HAVE IT S. Q..

02:53:14.784 --> 02:53:16.886
I I SEE IT WOULD REALLY THE-COMMITTEES MODELED ON A SMALLER

02:53:16.953 --> 02:53:18.488
SCALE AFTER THE EXISTING LAW

02:53:18.554 --> 02:53:20.723
REVISION COMMISSION WHICH IS ONE

02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:22.925
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE SENATOR AND

02:53:22.992 --> 02:53:26.896
SEVEN GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEE IS.

02:53:26.963 --> 02:53:28.965
OUT OF THE VOTE ON THAT -- IT'S

02:53:29.031 --> 02:53:31.801
MODELED AFTER THAT -- I DO THINK

02:53:31.868 --> 02:53:32.735
THAT HAVING AN ACTUAL

02:53:32.802 --> 02:53:33.636
LEGISLATIVE MEMBER ON THE

02:53:33.703 --> 02:53:34.303
COMMITTEE VERSUS JUST AN

02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:35.772
APPOINTEE FROM EACH OF THE

02:53:35.838 --> 02:53:38.508
HOUSES PROBABLY OR OR PROVIDES A

02:53:38.574 --> 02:53:39.509
LEVEL OF ELEVATION OR

02:53:39.575 --> 02:53:41.344
SIGNIFICANCE TO THAT POSITION

02:53:41.410 --> 02:53:43.613
THAT JUST A REGULAR APPOINTEE

02:53:43.679 --> 02:53:48.785
DOESN'T YOU KNOW HOW.

02:53:48.851 --> 02:53:49.619
WE ARE DOING VOTE ON SOMETHING

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:51.654
THAT ALLOWED THE GOVERNOR TO

02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:53.322
HAVE SEVEN INTO SOLELY TO BUT

02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:54.457
SENATOR MOORLACH.

02:53:54.524 --> 02:53:59.095
MADAM CHAIR -- HI I'M.

02:53:59.162 --> 02:54:00.897
I GET ONE INTERVIEW REVIEW

02:54:00.963 --> 02:54:04.167
EVERYTHING -- BUT THIS.

02:54:04.233 --> 02:54:05.601
I GUESS A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE

02:54:05.668 --> 02:54:06.836
IS IS THAT MEAN THAT THIS

02:54:06.903 --> 02:54:07.703
COMMITTEE COMES ROCKER

02:54:07.770 --> 02:54:09.338
COMMISSION COMES BACK AND SAYS

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:10.940
HERE'S ALL THE MODIFICATIONS WE

02:54:11.007 --> 02:54:12.909
WANT TO MAKE TO THE PENAL CODE

02:54:12.975 --> 02:54:14.210
WE GET THIS MASSIVE

02:54:14.277 --> 02:54:16.045
RECOMMENDATION FOR BILLS AT WHAT

02:54:16.112 --> 02:54:17.547
WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

02:54:17.613 --> 02:54:18.881
YEAH I DON'T HAVE A DEEPER

02:54:18.948 --> 02:54:19.982
UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXISTING

02:54:20.049 --> 02:54:21.651
PROCESS BUT YES GENERALLY WE

02:54:21.717 --> 02:54:23.286
WOULD WE THE COMMITTEE WOULD

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:25.488
COME BACK WITH A RECOMMENDATION.

02:54:25.555 --> 02:54:26.923
AND THEN ITWOULD BE UPON THE

02:54:26.989 --> 02:54:28.057
LEGISLATURE WHETHER TO TAKE

02:54:28.124 --> 02:54:29.826
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS UP AND

02:54:29.892 --> 02:54:31.928
MAKE THOSE CHANGES TO THEIR

02:54:31.994 --> 02:54:32.929
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

02:54:32.995 --> 02:54:35.398
AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHY

02:54:35.464 --> 02:54:38.501
WOULD WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A

02:54:38.568 --> 02:54:40.603
COMMITTEE CAME AND AND AND PAY

02:54:40.670 --> 02:54:42.271
FOR ALL THAT NGUYEN MAYBE IT

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:43.873
COULD BE DONE BY.

02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:47.076
PRIVATE SECTOR THINK TANK OR THE

02:54:47.143 --> 02:54:49.111
JUDICIARY DID JUDICIAL COUNCIL

02:54:49.178 --> 02:54:51.581
OR OR SOMEONE ELSE IF THERE IS

02:54:51.647 --> 02:54:54.083
YOU KNOW WHY WHY ARE WE TAKING

02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:56.185
IT UPON OURSELVES.

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:58.921
I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT -- THE

02:54:58.988 --> 02:55:00.356
COMMISSION EXIST TODAY AND THEY

02:55:00.423 --> 02:55:01.924
TùTAKE A DEEPER LOOK INTO THE

02:55:01.991 --> 02:55:04.427
VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR STATUTORY

02:55:04.493 --> 02:55:05.161
STRUCTURE.

02:55:05.228 --> 02:55:06.362
THEY'RE NOT REALLY SET UP IN A

02:55:06.429 --> 02:55:08.965
WAY TO LOOK AT THE PENAL CODE.

02:55:09.031 --> 02:55:10.666
AND SO WE THINK JUST ADDING

02:55:10.733 --> 02:55:12.969
RESOURCES FOR SOMETHING THAT

02:55:13.035 --> 02:55:14.737
ALREADY HAS AN EXISTING

02:55:14.804 --> 02:55:17.173
OPERATION -- ADMINISTRATIVE

02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:19.976
STRUCTURE OR PROCESS SO WE CAN

02:55:20.042 --> 02:55:21.644
HIT THE GROUND RUNNING -- MAKES

02:55:21.711 --> 02:55:23.846
MORE SENSE THAN LOOKING FOR

02:55:23.913 --> 02:55:25.848
OTHER ENTITIES OUTSIDE -- IF

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:27.550
THOSE ENTITIES EXISTED TODAY I

02:55:27.617 --> 02:55:29.185
THINK WE KNOW WITH THOSE

02:55:29.252 --> 02:55:31.087
RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE BEFORE --

02:55:31.153 --> 02:55:32.622
THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:34.924
TO MAKE -- YOU KNOW MAKE

02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:38.794
DECISIONS ON AND SO WE THINK

02:55:38.861 --> 02:55:40.496
HAVING A FOCUSED EFFORT.

02:55:40.563 --> 02:55:41.364
THE MODEL THAT ALREADY EXISTS --

02:55:41.430 --> 02:55:44.066
MAKES SENSE.

02:55:44.133 --> 02:55:45.801
THANK YOU MANAGER CERTAINLY.

02:55:45.868 --> 02:55:48.504
AND OF COURSE THE THE WAY THE

02:55:48.571 --> 02:55:50.273
PROPOSALS WRITTEN.

02:55:50.339 --> 02:55:52.708
IT DOESN'T SEEM -- TO ORATION

02:55:52.775 --> 02:55:53.876
SAY DOESN'T SEE IT.

02:55:53.943 --> 02:55:56.178
THERE THE FIVE APPOINTEES SOME

02:55:56.245 --> 02:55:57.613
COMMISSIONS IT DESIGNATES THERE

02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:00.049
WOULD BE.

02:56:00.116 --> 02:56:03.019
CERTAIN APPOINTEES WOULD BE.

02:56:03.085 --> 02:56:04.420
SAY FROM AN ACADEMIC SENATOR

02:56:04.487 --> 02:56:06.555
CERTAIN APPOINTEES WOULD BE FROM

02:56:06.622 --> 02:56:08.724
AND YOU KNOW COMMUNITY BASED AND

02:56:08.791 --> 02:56:10.226
I'M JUST GIVING NOT THAT THIS IS

02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:12.428
ANALOGOUS BUT IN THIS CASE IT

02:56:12.495 --> 02:56:14.363
JUST SAYS FIVE APPOINTEES

02:56:14.430 --> 02:56:15.765
WITHOUT.

02:56:15.831 --> 02:56:17.700
A SPECIFICATION OF PERHAPS WITH

02:56:17.767 --> 02:56:19.302
THEIR BACKGROUND WOULD BE.

02:56:19.368 --> 02:56:20.736
AND DID THE ADMINISTRATION

02:56:20.803 --> 02:56:22.972
ALREADY HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON OR

02:56:23.039 --> 02:56:24.774
WHY IT.

02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:26.309
WANTED TO LEAVE IT OPEN ENDED

02:56:26.375 --> 02:56:28.010
YEAH I THINK LEAVING IT OPEN AND

02:56:28.077 --> 02:56:30.246
IT WAS KIND TO ALLOW THEM TO USE

02:56:30.313 --> 02:56:32.114
THEIR NORMAL DELIVERED A PROCESS

02:56:32.181 --> 02:56:33.449
TO FIND THOSE WHO HAD THE BEST

02:56:33.516 --> 02:56:35.451
QUALIFICATIONS TO JUST PROVIDE

02:56:35.518 --> 02:56:37.053
MEANINGFUL.

02:56:37.119 --> 02:56:38.888
PARTICIPATION TO THE COMMITTEE

02:56:38.955 --> 02:56:41.891
SO YOU KNOW -- IT COULD BE A CBO

02:56:41.958 --> 02:56:44.026
IT COULD BE AN ACADEMIC IT COULD

02:56:44.093 --> 02:56:44.994
BE YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IT

02:56:45.061 --> 02:56:46.395
JUST IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THAT

02:56:46.462 --> 02:56:47.863
INDIVIDUAL HAVING A DEEP ENOUGH

02:56:47.930 --> 02:56:50.466
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PENAL CODE.

02:56:50.533 --> 02:56:52.768
AND TO REALLY PROVIDE HOW YOU

02:56:52.835 --> 02:56:54.270
AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW

02:56:54.337 --> 02:56:56.138
ADDING CONSTRAINTS ABOUT THAT

02:56:56.205 --> 02:57:00.209
SELECTION CRITERIA -- YOU KNOW

02:57:00.276 --> 02:57:10.219
COULD MAKE THAT MORE DIFFICULT.

02:57:10.286 --> 02:57:11.721
ALL RIGHT SO I'M -- LEAVING IT

02:57:11.787 --> 02:57:13.589
OPEN DESIGN IMAGINING THAT THERE

02:57:13.656 --> 02:57:16.125
WILL BE SOME INPUT ON THIS

02:57:16.192 --> 02:57:20.129
APPOINTMENT -- AND ON THE IF IF

02:57:20.196 --> 02:57:21.664
IT WERE TO MOVE FORWARD THEN

02:57:21.731 --> 02:57:23.499
WHAT SIX COMMISSION WOULD

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:26.969
COMPRISE OF ANDERSON -- BUT AT

02:57:27.036 --> 02:57:28.671
LEAST I DO APPRECIATE THAT IT

02:57:28.738 --> 02:57:30.806
WOULD BE A SUBSET OF AN EXISTING

02:57:30.873 --> 02:57:32.608
COMMISSION SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE

02:57:32.675 --> 02:57:33.376
ALL.

02:57:33.442 --> 02:57:35.044
OF THE FINDING OF A NEW

02:57:35.111 --> 02:57:35.878
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:57:35.945 --> 02:57:37.079
THOUGH IT CERTAINLY IS

02:57:37.146 --> 02:57:39.348
LEGITIMATE TO LOOK AT WHETHER

02:57:39.415 --> 02:57:41.550
BECAUSE IT IS PART OF AN

02:57:41.617 --> 02:57:45.588
EXISTING ONE WHETHER -- IT NEEDS

02:57:45.654 --> 02:57:47.056
THIS LEVEL OF GENERAL FUND.

02:57:47.123 --> 02:57:47.957
YEAH I THINK -- THE EXISTING

02:57:48.024 --> 02:57:49.992
COMMISSION STAFF IS SMALL IT'S

02:57:50.059 --> 02:57:52.261
FIVE AND A HALF POSITIONS --

02:57:52.328 --> 02:57:54.096
WE'RE REQUESTING THREE TO THE

02:57:54.163 --> 02:57:55.431
MURDER ANY IS THAT WILL SUPPORT

02:57:55.498 --> 02:57:58.134
THE COMMIT COMMITTEE DIRECTLY IN

02:57:58.200 --> 02:57:59.168
ADMINISTRATIVE SUFFICIENT.

02:57:59.235 --> 02:58:00.736
POSITION OF A SUPPORT THE

02:58:00.803 --> 02:58:01.504
COMMITTEE AND THE COMMISSION

02:58:01.570 --> 02:58:02.671
OVERALL.

02:58:02.738 --> 02:58:04.006
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF

02:58:04.073 --> 02:58:05.074
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

02:58:05.141 --> 02:58:07.610
COMMISSION WILL SUPPORT BOTH THE

02:58:07.676 --> 02:58:08.577
COMMISSION.

02:58:08.644 --> 02:58:09.145
THE COMMITTEE THEY'RE BOTH

02:58:09.211 --> 02:58:11.480
ATTORNEY POSITIONS AS WELL -- SO.

02:58:11.547 --> 02:58:13.149
THEY HAVE ALREADY A SIGNIFICANT

02:58:13.215 --> 02:58:14.984
AMOUNT OF WORK IN THEIR OWN

02:58:15.051 --> 02:58:17.019
PROCESS BUT I THINK I'M AT LEAST

02:58:17.086 --> 02:58:18.487
PROVIDING THOSE LEADERSHIP.

02:58:18.554 --> 02:58:20.222
POSITIONS -- IN MAKING THOSE

02:58:20.289 --> 02:58:22.158
AVAILABLE WILL HELP AGAIN --

02:58:22.224 --> 02:58:23.993
STAND THIS UP MORE QUICKLY.

OF ALL THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:29.385

AND THIS MODEL HAS BEEN IN PLACE

03:00:39.828 --> 03:00:40.596
FOR OVER SEVENTY FIVE YEARS.

03:00:40.663 --> 03:00:43.399
AND IT REQUIRES US TO DO MANY

03:00:43.465 --> 03:00:44.767
THINGS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:00:44.833 --> 03:00:46.235

PARTNERS -- SOME OF THE THINGS

03:00:50.839 --> 03:00:52.007
THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO IS

03:00:52.074 --> 03:00:54.476
ENHANCE AND MODIFY AND MAINTAIN.

03:00:54.543 --> 03:00:56.412
EXISTING SYSTEMS AND INTERFACES

03:00:56.478 --> 03:00:58.247
THAT SUPPORT REGISTRATION AND

03:00:58.314 --> 03:00:59.648
NOTIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA.

03:00:59.715 --> 03:01:01.150
IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE US TO

03:01:01.217 --> 03:01:02.885
COLLECT NEW DATA ON ON GOING

03:01:02.952 --> 03:01:04.520

AND NON CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL

03:01:07.923 --> 03:01:08.657
HISTORY.

03:01:08.724 --> 03:01:10.059
IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE US TO

03:01:10.125 --> 03:01:12.261
COLLECT MISSING DATA INCLUDING --

03:01:12.328 --> 03:01:14.763
DISPOSITION AND RISK ASSESSMENT

03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:16.298
DATA IN A STANDARDIZED FORMAT.

03:01:16.365 --> 03:01:18.267
AND IT WILL NOT ONLY REQUIRES TO

03:01:18.334 --> 03:01:20.502
DO THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

03:01:20.569 --> 03:01:22.738
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN NEW UNITS

03:01:22.805 --> 03:01:24.240
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

03:01:24.306 --> 03:01:25.841
THERE IS A LOT OF DESPAIR

03:01:25.908 --> 03:01:27.876
DATABASES BETWEEN -- LOOK

03:01:27.943 --> 03:01:30.112
FEDERAL AND STATE DATABASES AND

03:01:30.179 --> 03:01:31.780
SO A LOT OF THIS WORK IS GOING

03:01:31.847 --> 03:01:33.816
TO BE A MANUAL WORKLOAD SO WE'RE

03:01:33.882 --> 03:01:34.950
GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A NEW TEARING

03:01:35.017 --> 03:01:36.919
AND TERMINATION UNITS WITHIN THE

03:01:36.986 --> 03:01:38.787
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

03:01:38.854 --> 03:01:40.723
WE WILL ALSO HAVE TO PROVIDE

03:01:40.789 --> 03:01:42.291
THEM SYSTEM ACCESS BY A LOT OF

03:01:42.358 --> 03:01:43.726
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUSINESS

03:01:43.792 --> 03:01:45.294
PARTNERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DO

03:01:45.361 --> 03:01:47.730
NOT HAVE ACCESS -- TO THE DOJ

03:01:47.796 --> 03:01:49.098
DATABASES THAT SUPPORT

03:01:49.164 --> 03:01:50.399
REGISTRATION NOTIFICATION

03:01:50.466 --> 03:01:52.368
INCLUDING CHORDS PROBATION

03:01:52.434 --> 03:01:53.369
DEPARTMENTS COUNTY CUSTODIAL

03:01:53.435 --> 03:01:54.470
FACILITIES AND SOME OF THE

03:01:54.536 --> 03:01:56.805
SMALLER REGISTERING AGENCIES AT

03:01:56.872 --> 03:02:01.910
THE COUNTY AND THAT LOCAL LEVEL.

03:02:01.977 --> 03:02:03.612
SO IN ORDER TO DO THIS -- MOST

03:02:03.679 --> 03:02:04.713
FOLKS WOULD THINK THAT WE'RE

03:02:04.780 --> 03:02:05.581
GOING TO SINCE WE'RE GOING TO A

03:02:05.648 --> 03:02:06.115
TIER BASED SYSTEM WILL BE

03:02:06.181 --> 03:02:07.249
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SEX

03:02:07.316 --> 03:02:08.851
OFFENDERS AND THAT IS TRUE.

03:02:08.917 --> 03:02:10.786
EVENTUALLY WE WILL REDUCE THE

03:02:10.853 --> 03:02:12.655
NUMBER OF SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY

03:02:12.721 --> 03:02:13.722
IN CALIFORNIA.

03:02:13.789 --> 03:02:15.224
BUT IT WHAT IT DOESN'T DO AS IT

03:02:15.291 --> 03:02:16.792
DOESN'T REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

03:02:16.859 --> 03:02:18.527
REGISTRANTS THAT COME INTO THE

03:02:18.594 --> 03:02:20.296
SYSTEM THE REGISTRATION SYSTEM

03:02:20.362 --> 03:02:22.131
SO EVERY YEAR ABOUT FIVE

03:02:22.197 --> 03:02:22.865
THOUSAND NEW REGISTRANTS COME

03:02:22.931 --> 03:02:24.066
INTO THE SYSTEM.

03:02:24.133 --> 03:02:25.634
WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT HUNDRED

03:02:25.701 --> 03:02:27.069
AND FIFTY THOUSAND REGISTRANTS

03:02:27.136 --> 03:02:29.305
IN THE DATABASE AND WE HAVE FIVE

03:02:29.371 --> 03:02:30.639
THOUSAND NEW ONES COME IN EITHER

03:02:30.706 --> 03:02:31.707
THROUGH A CALIFORNIA CONVICTION

03:02:31.774 --> 03:02:33.776
OR A NON CALIFORNIA CONVICTION

03:02:33.842 --> 03:02:34.510
AND THEY MOVED HERE FROM OUT OF

03:02:34.576 --> 03:02:35.244
STATE.

03:02:35.311 --> 03:02:37.079
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE

03:02:37.146 --> 03:02:38.714
IS THAT WE HAVE A SUCCESSFUL

03:02:38.781 --> 03:02:40.683
TRANSITION TO THIS TO YOUR FACE

03:02:40.749 --> 03:02:42.151
SYSTEM FROM A SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN

03:02:42.217 --> 03:02:43.986
IN PLACE FOR SEVENTY FIVE YEARS

03:02:44.053 --> 03:02:45.220
BUT NOT ONLY TO HAVE A

03:02:45.287 --> 03:02:46.655
SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION.

03:02:46.722 --> 03:02:49.124
BUT TO MAINTAIN THAT TRANSITION

03:02:49.191 --> 03:02:50.859
THIS IS CHANGING CALIFORNIA'S

03:02:50.926 --> 03:02:52.728
BUSINESS MODEL FOR REGISTRATION

03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:55.064
AND WE WANT.

03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:56.398
TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT IT.

03:02:56.465 --> 03:02:58.367
WITH THE MAKING SURE WE HAVE ALL

03:02:58.434 --> 03:03:00.269
THE DATA WHEN WE DO THIS AND

03:03:00.336 --> 03:03:01.704
THAT WE DON'T INCUR ANY

03:03:01.770 --> 03:03:02.871
LIABILITY TO THE STATE OF

03:03:02.938 --> 03:03:03.839
CALIFORNIA.

03:03:03.906 --> 03:03:05.407
THAT WE DO IT ACCURATELY AND

03:03:05.474 --> 03:03:07.343
THAT WE DON'T -- IMPACT PUBLIC

03:03:07.409 --> 03:03:08.977
SAFETY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:03:09.044 --> 03:03:12.381
THAT WE DO THIS CORRECTLY.

03:03:12.448 --> 03:03:14.116
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE WILL

03:03:14.183 --> 03:03:16.218
HAVE TO HAVE RESOURCES BOTH FOR

03:03:16.285 --> 03:03:18.120
THE TRANSITION AND THE ONGOING

03:03:18.187 --> 03:03:19.688
MAINTENANCE.

03:03:19.755 --> 03:03:20.989
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

03:03:21.056 --> 03:03:22.524
AND FOR ALL THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:03:22.591 --> 03:03:24.159
PARTNERS THAT RELY ON THE

03:03:24.226 --> 03:03:25.794
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS A STATE

03:03:25.861 --> 03:03:27.596

RECORDS FOR THIS DATA.

03:03:30.299 --> 03:03:32.768
AND WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR

03:03:32.835 --> 03:03:36.505
TECHNOLOGIES -- AVAILABLE AND AT

03:03:36.572 --> 03:03:38.574
THE OPTIMAL LEVEL AND PROVIDE

ACCESS TO ALL THE ADDITIONAL --

03:03:41.343 --> 03:03:42.978
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SO THEY

03:03:43.045 --> 03:03:45.214
CAN FULFILL THEIR ROLE IN THIS

03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:47.049
TRANSITION TO THE NEW TERM BASED

03:03:47.116 --> 03:04:00.362

WHAT'S MY I'M.

03:04:03.766 --> 03:04:05.401

03:04:05.467 --> 03:04:07.703
VOTE ONLY.

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:10.973

03:05:11.233 --> 03:05:12.801
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE ONE TIME

03:05:12.868 --> 03:05:16.738
ONLY MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE.

03:05:16.805 --> 03:05:18.507
IN THAT THERE'S VARIOUS THINGS

03:05:18.574 --> 03:05:22.377

FOR THIRTY SEVEN NEW F. T. E.

03:06:12.895 --> 03:06:14.563
WHEN WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A SEX

03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:16.298
REGISTRY.

03:06:16.365 --> 03:06:18.534
WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE MORE

03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:19.968
PEOPLE BEING PUT ON THE SEX

03:06:20.035 --> 03:06:20.836
REGISTRY SO THIS IS DIFFERENT

03:06:20.903 --> 03:06:22.738
THAN THE APPS WERE WE DEFINITELY

03:06:22.804 --> 03:06:24.106
HAVE MORE PEOPLE BEING PUT IN ON

03:06:24.172 --> 03:06:25.541
THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST.

03:06:25.607 --> 03:06:27.175
WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE MORE

03:06:27.242 --> 03:06:29.111
PEOPLE AND IN FACT BY OUR

03:06:29.177 --> 03:06:33.615
STATUTE CHANGE WE WILL BE HAVING.

03:06:33.682 --> 03:06:35.350
FEWER TO MONITOR OVER TIME.

03:06:35.417 --> 03:06:38.720
SO -- THAT'S WHY I'M

03:06:38.787 --> 03:06:40.756
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE APPROVAL

03:06:40.822 --> 03:06:41.990
OF THE BCP.

03:06:42.057 --> 03:06:43.825
IF I COULD ADDRESS THAT SO.

03:06:43.892 --> 03:06:46.228
IT WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

03:06:46.295 --> 03:06:47.462
REGISTRANTS ON THE REGISTRY

03:06:47.529 --> 03:06:48.664
EVENTUALLY.

03:06:48.730 --> 03:06:50.198
BUT WHAT IT DOESN'T REDUCE IT

03:06:50.265 --> 03:06:51.400
DOESN'T REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

03:06:51.466 --> 03:06:53.235
REGISTRANTS THAT COME INTO THE

03:06:53.302 --> 03:06:54.570

03:18:55.023 --> 03:18:56.090
THERE WAS PROBABLY

03:18:56.157 --> 03:18:57.859
MISCOMMUNICATION WHEN THIS VCP

03:18:57.925 --> 03:18:58.893
WAS DEVELOPED ON THE ACTUAL

03:18:58.960 --> 03:19:00.862
NUMBER ALL NUMBER OF PERMANENT

03:19:00.928 --> 03:19:02.230
POSITIONS THAT ARE NEEDED SO

03:19:02.297 --> 03:19:04.232
STOCK THE DEFRAY IT SAYS THIRTY

03:19:04.299 --> 03:19:05.700
SEVEN BUT I THINK IT TO YOU YEAH

03:19:05.767 --> 03:19:07.201
I THINK THE NUMBER PROBABLY

03:19:07.268 --> 03:19:08.202
SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAUGHT.

03:19:08.269 --> 03:19:09.704
PROBABLY TWELVE I THINK WOULD

03:19:09.771 --> 03:19:10.571
THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT NUMBER

03:19:10.638 --> 03:19:11.372
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BRING US UP

03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:13.675
FROM THE TWENTY FIVE FROM BEFORE.

03:19:13.741 --> 03:19:18.446
ADD TWELVE AND IT WOULD BE --

03:19:18.513 --> 03:19:19.347
THIRTY SEVEN ANYWAYS.

03:19:19.414 --> 03:19:20.682
WE CAN WORK OUT THE DETAILS

03:19:20.748 --> 03:19:21.683
LATER BUT I DO THINK YOU'RE

03:19:21.749 --> 03:19:22.850
RIGHT I'D I THINK THAT THERE WAS

03:19:22.917 --> 03:19:24.252
PROBABLY JUST MISCOMMUNICATION

03:19:24.319 --> 03:19:26.254
ON THE ACTUAL NUMBER.

03:19:26.321 --> 03:19:27.989
TOTAL ONGOING SHOULD BE RESET

03:19:28.056 --> 03:19:32.026
FOR USTO VOTE ON AND SO I MEAN

03:19:32.093 --> 03:19:32.260
I THINK.

03:19:32.327 --> 03:19:35.396
WHILE I MADE A LITTLE BAD.

03:19:35.463 --> 03:19:36.264
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE I'M

03:19:36.331 --> 03:19:38.199
STILL WORKING FROM A B. C. P.

03:19:38.266 --> 03:19:40.068
THAT TELLS ME THAT MANY NEW

03:19:40.134 --> 03:19:46.808
POSITIONS AND I'M SORRY BUT

03:19:46.874 --> 03:19:48.109
AFTER THE POSITIONS WE ALREADY

03:19:48.176 --> 03:19:49.310
ADDED.

03:19:49.377 --> 03:19:50.578
THERE'S NO WAY TO JUSTIFY THAT

03:19:50.645 --> 03:19:51.279
MANY ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO

03:19:51.346 --> 03:19:51.979
PROCESS THE SAME AMOUNT OF

03:19:52.046 --> 03:19:53.981
PEOPLE EVERY YEAR EVEN THOUGH WE

03:19:54.048 --> 03:19:55.283
ARE PROCESSING ON FOR A

03:19:55.350 --> 03:19:58.519
DIFFERENT TO YOUR SYSTEM -- SO

03:19:58.586 --> 03:19:59.354
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE

03:19:59.420 --> 03:20:00.321
CLARIFICATION BUT WHAT I WOULD

03:20:00.388 --> 03:20:02.323
PREFER.

03:20:02.390 --> 03:20:04.926
APPRECIATE IS A CORRECTED BCP SO

03:20:04.992 --> 03:20:06.928
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND THIS

03:20:06.994 --> 03:20:10.865
AMOUNT OF TIME. EIGHT THREE LIKE

03:20:10.932 --> 03:20:11.499
TO KNOW MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY I

03:20:11.566 --> 03:20:12.533
DON'T THINK THE COSTS OF THE

03:20:12.600 --> 03:20:14.335
POPOSAL WILL CHANGE THOUGH I

03:20:14.402 --> 03:20:16.104
THINK IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF

03:20:16.170 --> 03:20:17.405
THE PRESENT ABOVE THE POSITIONS

03:20:17.472 --> 03:20:19.674
I THINK THIS IS -- IF YOU LOOK

03:20:19.741 --> 03:20:21.109
AT THE B. C. P. I THINK IT EVEN

03:20:21.175 --> 03:20:23.010
TALKS ABOUT A A HIGHER NEEDS

03:20:23.077 --> 03:20:25.079
THAN -- THIRTY SEVEN TO ACTUALLY

03:20:25.146 --> 03:20:26.347
DO THE WORK PLUS THERE'S A BIG

03:20:26.414 --> 03:20:27.949
COMPONENT RELATED TO I. T. I

03:20:28.015 --> 03:20:29.851
THINK ULTIMATELY ON GOING IT

03:20:29.917 --> 03:20:31.619
WOULD BE THIRTY SEVEN BUT AGAIN

03:20:31.686 --> 03:20:32.587
THIS IS ONLY A THREE YEAR

03:20:32.653 --> 03:20:34.055
PROPOSAL WE WILL COME BACK FOR

03:20:34.122 --> 03:20:37.759
ONGOING RESOURCES -- ONCE WE'VE --

03:20:37.825 --> 03:20:39.694
ONCE DOJ IN CT HAVE FINISHED

03:20:39.761 --> 03:20:40.895
THAT WHOLE PROCESS WITH THE I.

03:20:40.962 --> 03:20:42.830
T. PROJECT -- AND THEN WE CAN

03:20:42.897 --> 03:20:44.365
LOOK AT WHILE ONGOING WORKLOAD

03:20:44.432 --> 03:20:48.236
IS AND WHAT THE MAINTENANCE AND

03:20:48.302 --> 03:20:48.836
OPERATIONS OF THE SYSTEM WOULD

03:20:48.903 --> 03:20:51.472
BE.

03:20:51.539 --> 03:20:53.274
WHEN YOU DO THAT?

03:20:53.341 --> 03:20:54.742
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT WE

03:20:54.809 --> 03:20:57.178
ALREADY APPROVED LAST YEAR AND

03:20:57.245 --> 03:20:59.347
THAT THEY WERE I. T. POSITIONS

03:20:59.414 --> 03:21:00.615
SO I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ANY

03:21:00.681 --> 03:21:01.849
DISAGREEMENT.

03:21:01.916 --> 03:21:03.084
THAT.

03:21:03.151 --> 03:21:04.685
THERE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED I T.

03:21:04.752 --> 03:21:06.220
AND THERE'S A NEW DEMAND ON THE

03:21:06.287 --> 03:21:10.358
I. T. BUT TO FURTHER. FOR A

03:21:10.425 --> 03:21:10.825
FURTHER EXPENDITURE.

03:21:10.892 --> 03:21:13.694
IS.

03:21:13.761 --> 03:21:15.663
THE HARD STILL FOR ME TO IMAGINE

03:21:15.730 --> 03:21:20.401
BECAUSE OF AGAIN WE'RE STILL

03:21:20.468 --> 03:21:22.537
TALKING ABOUT PROCESSING THE

03:21:22.603 --> 03:21:24.172
SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND YOU

03:21:24.238 --> 03:21:27.008
ALREADY HAD A CORE OF STAFF THAT

03:21:27.074 --> 03:21:28.843
PROCESS THOSE PEOPLE SO YES NOW

03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:31.312
WE'VE COMPLICATED THE PROCESSING.

03:21:31.379 --> 03:21:34.148
SO I'M GONNA EXCEPT THAT DUE TO

03:21:34.215 --> 03:21:35.683
THE COMPLICATE.

03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:36.818
COMPLICATION OF THE PROCESSING

03:21:36.884 --> 03:21:39.086
THAT WE BATTED IT WOULD REQUIRE

03:21:39.153 --> 03:21:40.922
SOME ADDITIONAL MORE.

03:21:40.988 --> 03:21:47.995
BUT THE CLOSEST BUT THE THE THE

03:21:48.062 --> 03:21:49.597
NUMBER MORE THAT'S BEEN

03:21:49.664 --> 03:21:52.200
ADVOCATED STILL SEEMS ON JUST

03:21:52.266 --> 03:21:57.205
FILE BOTH TO ME.

03:21:57.271 --> 03:21:58.005
ANYWAY.

03:21:58.072 --> 03:21:59.273
AND THEN YOU HAVE RECORD BCP

03:21:59.340 --> 03:21:59.941
RISE SO WILL AND THAT'S WHY

03:22:00.007 --> 03:22:00.741
PROVIDED A DOCUMENT WITH THE

03:22:00.808 --> 03:22:02.043
SIDE BY SIDE SO YOU COULD SEE

03:22:02.109 --> 03:22:03.244
THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF WHAT OF

03:22:03.311 --> 03:22:04.512
WHAT THAT WAS BEFORE THE LAW

03:22:04.579 --> 03:22:05.746
CHANGED AND YOU CAN SEE THE NEW

03:22:05.813 --> 03:22:07.048
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART OF THE

03:22:07.114 --> 03:22:07.348
NEW SYSTEM.

03:22:07.415 --> 03:22:08.850
SO THE NEW BUSINESS MODEL GOING

03:22:08.916 --> 03:22:11.552
FORWARD -- WHICH WE FEEL FOR

03:22:11.619 --> 03:22:12.186
SUPPORT AND OF COURSE IT COULD

03:22:12.253 --> 03:22:14.188
BE AND WE HAD EXPERIENCES

03:22:14.255 --> 03:22:15.957
ALREADY WHEN WE WERE.

03:22:16.023 --> 03:22:17.258
HAVING OUR DISCUSSION WITH CDC

03:22:17.325 --> 03:22:18.626
ARE ABOUT THE POSITIONS THEY

03:22:18.693 --> 03:22:20.761
WERE ASKING FOR FOURTEEN TWENTY

03:22:20.828 --> 03:22:22.230
ONE WHEN WE REALIZED THAT.

03:22:22.296 --> 03:22:23.764
IT WASN'T THE POSITIONS THEY

03:22:23.831 --> 03:22:25.867
WERE ASKING FOR WE'RE NOT REALLY

03:22:25.933 --> 03:22:27.235
ENTIRELY.

03:22:27.301 --> 03:22:29.036
TO IMPLEMENT FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE

03:22:29.103 --> 03:22:31.005
BUT BECAUSE THEY HAD OTHER

03:22:31.072 --> 03:22:33.140
IMPROVEMENTS THAT CD ZERO IS

03:22:33.207 --> 03:22:34.342
TRYING TO MAKE.

03:22:34.408 --> 03:22:35.977
TO VARIOUS OF THEIR PROCESSING

03:22:36.043 --> 03:22:39.213
OF RECORDS AND SO IF IN FACT

03:22:39.280 --> 03:22:40.848
WHAT IS BEING ASKED HERE.

03:22:40.915 --> 03:22:42.650
IS VERY SOME PREVENTS THAT MIGHT

03:22:42.717 --> 03:22:45.219
HAVE HAPPENED INDEPENDENT OF THE

03:22:45.286 --> 03:22:45.419
BILL.

03:22:45.486 --> 03:22:46.888
THEN I WANT TO SEE THAT

03:22:46.954 --> 03:22:48.489
DISTINGUISHED IN THE B. C. P.

03:22:48.556 --> 03:22:52.493
BECAUSE TO BE ASKED. TO EVALUATE

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:55.296
THIS BASED PURELY ON WHAT THE

03:22:55.363 --> 03:22:58.065
STATUTORY CHANGE REQUIRES IS

03:22:58.132 --> 03:22:59.534
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN

03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:01.135
WHAT YOU A DEPARTMENT MAY

03:23:01.202 --> 03:23:03.504
LEGITIMATELY WANT TO MAKE

03:23:03.571 --> 03:23:06.040
IMPROVEMENTS. TO WITH THE WAY IT

03:23:06.107 --> 03:23:12.346
PROCESSES IT PROCESS SEES.

ALSO A RECORDS FOR NOW BECAUSE

03:23:13.681 --> 03:23:14.282
IT'S SIMILAR.

03:23:14.348 --> 03:23:15.116
IN BUT DISTINGUISHES BECAUSE

03:23:15.182 --> 03:23:16.450
IT'S NOT RIGHT NOW DISTINGUISHED

03:23:16.517 --> 03:23:18.219

03:25:50.237 --> 03:25:52.306
TO BE COMPLETED UNTIL JULY FIRST

03:25:52.373 --> 03:25:53.874

03:25:53.941 --> 03:25:55.843
WITH THE REPORT DUE -- THE JULY

03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:57.812

03:25:57.878 --> 03:26:00.981
RIGHT OKAY BUT THE MILLION SAYS

03:26:01.048 --> 03:26:02.883
I MEAN WHAT.

03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:03.751
BY ONE GIVE YOU THE ANSWER BUT

03:26:03.818 --> 03:26:04.919
ARE YOU TELLING US THAT THE

03:26:04.985 --> 03:26:06.253
MILLION WAS INADEQUATE IT SAYS

03:26:06.320 --> 03:26:07.321

03:26:07.388 --> 03:26:09.423

03:26:11.092 --> 03:26:12.259
STATEWIDE.

03:26:12.326 --> 03:26:13.961
SO THAT IS.

03:26:14.028 --> 03:26:15.963
THE INFORMATION THAT WE WANT

03:26:16.030 --> 03:26:17.231
THAT'S THREE FORTY WOULD GIVE US

03:26:17.298 --> 03:26:19.166
ABSOLUTELY AND AND I AM NOT

03:26:19.233 --> 03:26:20.701
SAYING THE MILLION DOLLARS IS

03:26:20.768 --> 03:26:22.169
ADEQUATE THE WRIST THERE WERE NO

03:26:22.236 --> 03:26:23.871
PERSONNEL THEY CAME WITH THAT

03:26:23.938 --> 03:26:25.706
MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS JUST A

03:26:25.773 --> 03:26:27.374
MILLION DOLLARS TO COMPILE.

03:26:27.441 --> 03:26:31.812

UNTESTED SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS.

03:26:36.517 --> 03:26:39.553
SO WHY DO WE NEED A HUNDRED

03:26:39.620 --> 03:26:40.221
NINETY FOUR THOUSAND IT'S JUST A

03:26:40.287 --> 03:26:42.256
LIMITED TERM -- PERSON TO

03:26:42.323 --> 03:26:43.023
ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

03:26:43.090 --> 03:26:44.859
GET THE REPORT COMPILED WITH ALL

03:26:44.925 --> 03:26:46.460
OF THE DATA THAT'S COMING IN

03:26:46.527 --> 03:26:48.162
FROM THE LOCALS.

03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:52.933
AND IF THAT IS -- A LIMITED TERM --

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:54.902
ALLOCATION THAT THIS BODY

03:26:54.969 --> 03:26:56.737
DECIDES CAN COME OUT OF THAT

03:26:56.804 --> 03:26:59.540
MILLION DOLLARS THEN.

03:26:59.607 --> 03:27:01.442
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

03:27:01.509 --> 03:27:03.077
WELL IT'S JUST THAT IT IS THE

03:27:03.144 --> 03:27:04.879
LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACT.

03:27:04.945 --> 03:27:07.882
AND NOW CERTAINLY IT'S IT'S IT'S

03:27:07.948 --> 03:27:10.017
COMPLETELY CONCEIVABLE THAT THE

03:27:10.084 --> 03:27:10.684
DEPARTMENT FELT IT WAS

03:27:10.751 --> 03:27:12.286
INADEQUATE AT THE TIME BUT I

03:27:12.353 --> 03:27:15.823
DON'T REMEMBER IN THE DISCUSSION.

03:27:15.890 --> 03:27:18.225
THAT SPECIFIC ASPECT RACE THAT

03:27:18.292 --> 03:27:20.060
YOU KNOW THIS REALLY ISN'T GOING

03:27:20.127 --> 03:27:21.996
TO BE ADEQUATE FOR US TO BE ABLE

03:27:22.062 --> 03:27:24.431
TO COMPILE THE REPORT.

03:27:24.498 --> 03:27:27.334
ON YOUR OWN THAT CERTAINLY HEY

03:27:27.401 --> 03:27:29.904
IT CAN HAPPEN BUT IT.

03:27:29.970 --> 03:27:31.672
WAS NOT DISCUSSED AND IT WAS

03:27:31.739 --> 03:27:37.178
PART OF THE ALLOCATION WE GET A

03:27:37.244 --> 03:27:39.013
SO AT THE TIME I THINK THE THE

03:27:39.079 --> 03:27:40.548
PURPOSE OF THE ALLOCATION WAS TO

03:27:40.614 --> 03:27:41.682
DISTRIBUTE IT TO THE THE LOCALS

03:27:41.749 --> 03:27:43.217
RIGHT TO GET ACCOUNT AND SO I

03:27:43.284 --> 03:27:43.951
DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY

03:27:44.018 --> 03:27:45.252
CONVERSATION AT THAT POINT TIME

03:27:45.319 --> 03:27:45.786

03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:58.732
LINE IN THE BUDGET ACT IT'S IN

03:27:58.799 --> 03:28:01.569
