SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY FOUR BY SENATOR ARCHULETA AND ACTUALLY INTO HOME INSPECTIONS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY FOUR REGARDING LICENSE PLUMBING CONTRACTOR REPAIR EXEMPTIONS. UNDER CURRENT LAW PLUMBING CONTRACTORS ARE LCENSED BY THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD AND ARE CERTIFIED TO PERFORMANCE SEWER LATERAL INSPECTIONS AND MAKE REPAIRS BASED ON THEIR INSPECTIONS. SEWER LATERAL INSPECTIONS ARE NOT PART OF A TRADITIONAL HOME INSPECTIONS SEWER LATERAL INSPECTIONS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SURE LEAKS ARE REQUIRED BY MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES AT THE SAME TIME HOME IS SOLD. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS A HOME INSPECTOR A HOME INSPECTION COMPANY OR EMPLOYEE OF THE HOME INSPECTION COMPANY FROM PERFORMING WORK ON ANY HOME WHICH THEY HAVE INSPECTED IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. THESE PREVENT THE PROHIBITIONS ARE IN LAW BECAUSE HOME INSPECTORS ARE NOT LICENSE HOWEVER PLUMBER'S LICENSE BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE LICENSING BOARDS ARE ALLOWED TO INSPECT AND REPAIR SEWER LATERALS. CURRENTLY IT IS CONSIDERED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE FOR PLUMBING CONTRACTOR TO DO BOTH THE SEWER INSPECTION AND THE SEWER REPAIR IF THE COMPANY IS ALSO COMPACT THAT CONDUCTED A HOME INSPECTION. ON THE SAME PROPERTY. SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR CORRECTS THIS POBLEM ALLOWS THE CONSUMER MORE CHOICES AND ALLOWS THEM TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY. SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR CLARIFIES THAT THE LICENSE PLUMBING CONTRACTOR CAN MAKE REPAIRS TO A SEWER LATERAL PIPE. THEY HAVE INSPECTED EVEN IF THEY OR THEIR COMPANY HAS PERFORMED A HOME INSPECTION ON THE SAME PROPERTY. AND IT TWENTY SEVENTEEN ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY SEVEN PROVIDED AN EXEMPTION FOR LICENSE ROOF INSPECTORS SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR WOULD PROVIDE A SIMILAR EXEMPTION FOR THESE SPECIALIST LICENSED PLUMBERS. SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR PROTECT CONSUMERS WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO CHOOSE A LICENSED PLUMBING CONTRACTOR TO CONDUCT A SEWER LATERAL INSPECTION AND MAKE ANY NEEDED REPAIRS. EVEN IF THE PLUMBERS COMPANY HAS PERFORMED A HOME INSPECTION ON THE SAME PROPERTY THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY THREE BY SENATOR CABALLERO AND ACTUALLY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CENTER COPIER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THREE TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD CREATE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. FOR CLAIMS AGAINST WATER AND SEWER AGENCY RATE SETTINGS. WATER AND SEWER UTILITY BUDGETS ARE FUNDED BY REVENUE COLLECTED THROUGH SERVICE RATES THESE RATES PROVIDE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO SUPPLY SAFE DRINKING WATER UPGRADE AND IMPROVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS LAWSUITS THAT SEEK REFUNDS OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE EXISTING RATE STRUCTURES YEARS AFTER RATES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND COLLECTED DELAYED LAWSUITS CAN THREATEN AN AGENCY'S ABILITY TO REPAY DEBT GUARANTEED. BY REVENUE FROM RATE DERAIL ONGOING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND GENERALLY UNDERMINE AND AGENCIES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN STABLE BUDGETS NECESSARY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. SB THREE TWENTY THREE ADDS CONSISTENCY TO EXISTING LAW BY AUTHORIZING A LITTLE LOCAL AGENCY OR INTERESTED PERSON TO BRING A VALIDATION ACTION IN SUPERIOR COURT TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF A FEE OR CHARGE FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICES IF A VALIDATION ACTION IS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS PARTIES WOULD BE BARRED FROM CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE FEE FOR THE CHARGE. THIS BILL IS IN LINE WITH EXISTING PRECEDENT MODELED AFTER THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND PER MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC RATES OR CHARGES BY ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO BRING CHALLENGES WITHIN A REASONABLE BUT LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BALANCE THE INTEREST OF RATE PAYERS WITH THOSE A PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCY AND IN THE CURRENT PRACTICE.

THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS SENATE BILL THREE THREE ONE ALSO KNOWN AS THE SILENCE NO MORE ACT EXPANDS THE PROHIBITION ON NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS ALSO KNOWN AS NDA'S. TO NOW COVER SETTLEMENTS AGREEMENTS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS INVOLVING ALL FORMS OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION. THIS BILL ALSO EXPANDS THE PROHIBITION ON OVERLY BROAD CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES IN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS TO COVER WORKERS WHO ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN THESE TYPES OF CLAUSES AS PART OF A SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS. RECENT AMENDMENTS MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT PREVENT AN EMPLOYER FROM INCLUDING A RELEASE OF CLAIMS IN A SEVERANCE AGREEMENT IT DOES NOT PREVENT AN EMPLOYER FROM PROHIBITING THE DISCLOSURE OF ANY AMOUNT PAID IN A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. IT ALSO DOES NOT PREVENT AN EMPLOYER FROM PROHIBITING THE DISCLOSURE OF TRADE SECRETS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE UNLAWFUL ACTS IN THE WORKPLACE. AS MANY OF YOU MAY REMEMBER I AUTHORED AND THEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED IN SB EIGHT TWENTY ALSO KNOWN AS A STAND ACT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. SB EIGHT TWENTY SPECIFICALLY BANNED NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS IN CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION. IMPORTANTLY THE STANDARD ALSO ALLOWS THE CLAIMANT TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALITY IF THEY SO CHOOSE. AUSTIN THIS HISTORIC LAW THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THAT SECRET SETTLEMENTS OR HELPING TO PERPETRATE HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENTS BY ALLOWING COMPLAINTS TO BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. OF COURSE SECRET SETTLEMENTS PLAY AS MUCH A ROLE IN PERPETRATING WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT AND BIAS BASED ON RACE ETHNICITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AGE DISABILITY RELIGION AMONG OTHERS. BECAUSE HERE TO COMPLAINTS ARE KEPT SECRET AND THOSE WHO RAISE THE COMPLAINTS ARE EFFECTIVELY SILENCED. MEMBERS WE ALL KNOW IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY EMPLOYER TO TRY TO SILENCE A WORKER BECAUSE HERE SHE WAS A VICTIM OF ANY TYPE OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. THE SILENCE NO MORE ACT WILL EMPOWER SURVIVORS TO SPEAK OUT IF THEY SO WISH SO THE PERPETRATORS CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND WE CAN HOPEFULLY PREVENT ABUSERS FROM CONTINUING TO TORMENT AND ABUSE OTHER WORKERS. WORKERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS DEPLORABLE BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE BOTH THE DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TO PREVENT FUTURE ABUSERS BY PERPETRATORS ABUSES BY PERPETRATORS.
