WELCOME TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEARING JUST A FEW HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS BEFORE YOU MOVE FORWARD. SPEAKER RENDON HAS APPOINTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER TO REPLACE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO TO REPLACE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR TODAY'S HEARING ONLY. WE HAVE EIGHT ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY. WE HAVE ONE ITEM PROPOSED FOR CONSENT WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SP ONE FOUR NINE EIGHT SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE. WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON A CONSECUTIVE ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM ESTABLISHED. IN ORDER TO MOVE THROUGH OUR AGENDA. IN A NICE QUICK MANNER. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL ALLOW TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BEYOND THESE LIMITS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION APPOSITE BY POSITION BREVITY IS APPRECIATED. WE HERE ARE BILLS IN SIGN IN ORDER. SINCE WE'D DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM. WELL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. OKAY LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE FIRST BILL TODAY IS ITEM NUMBER SIX S. B. TWELVE SIXTY SENATOR JACKSON WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM. HERE TO PRESENT S. B.. TWELVE SIXTY THIS IS AN ON THE BUS FIREPREVENTION AND FORESTRY MANAGEMENT BILL. THAT WILL PROMOTE LONG TERM FOREST HEALTH. AND WILDLIFE RESILIENCY THROUGH CALIFORNIA. THERE WERE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. A I DON'T NEED TO TELL THE CHAIR PROBABLY ANY MEMBER IN THIS ROOM ABOUT WHAT A DEVASTATING FIRE YEAR WE HAD LAST YEAR. WITH ONE POINT TWO MILLION ACRES OF LAND BURNED OVER NINE THOUSAND WILD FIRES IGNITED ACROSS THE STATE. OVER TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES DESTROYED. AND THE FIRES CONTINUE TO THIS VERY DAY IN AT THIS VERY MOMENT IN THE CHAIRS DISTRICT SO. WE NEED TO GET ON IT -- THIS BILL AIMS TO DO THAT BY BREAKING THAT CYCLE. BY REORIENTING CALIFORNIA'S FOREST MANAGEMENT POLICIES TOWARD LONG TERM FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE RESILIENCY. THIS MEASURE ENABLES FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT. AND CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAND MANAGERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISKS. INCLUDING THROUGH THE EXPANDED USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRES. WE MUST MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY ON THIS ISSUE AND I BELIEVE THIS COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE. DOES JUST THAT THERE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS THAT I JUST LIKE TO MENTION. UNDER EXISTING LAW CITIES AND COUNTIES MUST ADOPT AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF RECEIVING MAPS OF THESE ZONES FROM CAL FIRE. AREAS LOCATED WITHIN THE STONES HAVE TO COMPLY WITH SPECIFIED FIRE PREVENTION STANDARDS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE MAINTAINING DEFENSIBLE SPACE FOR DWELLINGS AND MANAGEMENT. ONSITE FIRE FUELS. UNLESS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAKES A FINDING SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS ARE NOT NEEDED OR EFFECTIVE FOR FIRE PROTECTION WITHIN THE AREA. THIS BILL REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SEND COPIES OF THEIR ORDINANCE TO CAL FIRE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF ENACTMENT. TO GIVE THE AGENCY BETTER INFORMATION AND AWARENESS FOR ON THE GROUND FIRE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND EFFORTS AND INTENTIONS WITHIN THOSE HIGH FIRE SEVERITY AREAS. EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ADOPT SAFETY ELEMENTS WITHIN THEIR GENERAL PLAN CONTAINING AMONG OTHER THINGS INFORMATION ABOUT AREA FIRE HAZARDS COMPREHENSIVE GOALS AND POLICIES. DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST UNREASONABLE FIRE RISKS AND FEASIBLE IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES TO REALIZE THOSE GOALS. ABOUT LOCAL AGENCIES MUST SUBMIT A DRAFT OF THEIR SAFETY ELEMENT TO THE STATE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AT LEAST NINETY DAYS BEFORE ITS ADOPTION. AND THE BOARD HAS TO REVIEW AND COMMENT ON THE DRAFT ELEMENT SAFETY ELEMENT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF RECEIPT BUT UNFORTUNATELY. THE BOARDS -- HAVE OFTEN FOUND THAT THE NINETY DAY SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS DOESN'T ALLOW ENOUGH TIME FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE WITH THE BOARD. ON RECOMMENDATIONS IT MAKES REGARDING A DRAFT SAFETY ELEMENT. THIS MEASURE REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO NOTIFY CALIFORNIA WHEN IT STARTS IT'S DRAFTING PROCESS ALLOWING CAL FIRE TO ENGAGE WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES EARLIER IN THE PROCESS. INSTEAD OF WAITING TO AT THE TO THE VERY END TO PROVIDE INPUT. BASIC FUNDAMENTAL BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT IN THE PAST AND WE BETTER DO IT NOW. AND GET GOING NOW AS FAST AS WE CAN REMEDIATE THIS TERRIBLE CONDITION WE HAVEN'T FLOORS. THANK YOU SENATOR IF YOU DON'T MIND REVIEW A LITTLE BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING UPSET SORT OF A QUORUM AND WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS EARLIER TODAY.

OKAY NEXUS ITEM NUMBER THREE SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE WHITE HOUSE YOU. WELCOME SENATOR. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON FED UP THE NEW I AM HERE TO PRESENT I SP EIGHT THREE ONE I WHICH IS MY THIRD. PERHAPS MY FINAL BILL OF THAT ADDRESS THE BARRIERS TO BUILDING EXCESS THREE DWELLING. UNITS LET ME START OFF BY MAKING A FEW KEY CARD CLARIFICATIONS THE FIRST BEING THAT I'VE WORKED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING. A WE'VE UP PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ONE EIGHTY YOU BILL ARM THAT WILL TIE HIS BILL OR PORTIONS OF HIS BILL. TO AND MY BILL TOGETHER WE DID THIS A AS WITH SENATOR SKINNER WHO HAVEN'T ANOTHER A EIGHTY YOU PEER BILL. OBVIOUSLY WE CANNOT DO THAT HOWEVER WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT ARM SECONDLY ALTHOUGH I'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS IN OTHER COMMITTEES. I AM WILL NOT BE TAKING AMENDMENTS HERE A IN THIS COMMITTEE OF ONE BECAUSE THERE ARE. NO AMENDMENTS OFFERED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT THAT WE WILL PRESENTING THE BILL AS IT HAS BEEN AMENDMENT AMENDED FROM THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT I INTRODUCE A MY FIRST BILL ON EIGHTY YEARS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALONG WITH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM WHO IT IS HAS HIS OWN OUR BATCH OF EIGHTY YOU BILLS MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED FROM CALLS ASKING FOR HELP ON ON PETE FROM. CONSTITUENTS AND PEOPLE OUTSIDE MY DISTRICT ABOUT THEIR EIGHTY YOU BILL. ABOUT THE BUILDING AN EIGHTY YOU IN SANTA BARBARA [inaudible] A ANDREAS BLOOMS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIS BANK A REQUESTING THE FULL PAYMENT OF HIS MORTGAGE BECAUSE HE SIGNED AN OWNER OCCUPANCY AGREEMENT THE CITY REQUIRED. FOR A AND EIGHTY YOU BUILDING PERMITS THIS WAS AFTER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AFTER TO AB OR S. B. TEN SIXTEEN NINETEEN INTO AFFECT. A BANK CANNOT BECOME AN OWNER OCCUPANT IN THE EVENT OF THE FORECLOSURE AND HIS BANK IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. IN CONTRAST TO COUNTY JUST NEXT TO ME GIULIANA WEINBERG TRIED TO COMFORT THE BACK HALF OF HER HOUSE TO NEEDY YOU FOR HER DAUGHTER. THE COST OF CONVERTING THE LAUNDRY ROOM TO A KITCHEN WAS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE COST OF THE IMPACT FEE WITH TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IN SANTA ANA JENNIFER GARCIA REQUESTED A PERMIT TO CONVERT HER UNDER UTILIZED GARAGE TO AN EIGHTY YEAR. SHE WAS TOLD SHE WOULD HAVE TO BUILD A NEW GARAGE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COVERED PARKING SPACES SHE WAS. SHE WAS ABOUT TO LOSE THIS WAS AFTER S. B. TEN SIXTY NINE AFTER BECAME STATE LAW THAT CITIES COULDN'T REQUIRED THAT. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD OUT WITH THEIR PROJECTS NONE OF IT IS GOING FORWARD. WITH THESE PEOPLE ON MINE AND HUNDREDS OF OTHERS LIKE THEM IN MIND AYE IF WORK TO PUT TOGETHER GOOD PUBLIC POLICY THAT WILL HELP THESE FOLKS BUILD. MORE HOUSING IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD OR ON THEIR PROPERTY. IF WE DO NOT ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS WERE DOING TO THINKS. WORK EITHER DISCOURAGING HOMEOWNERS FROM ASSISTING US IN THE HOUSING CRISIS WERE WE'RE ENCOURAGING FOLKS TO BUILD THESE UNITS WITHOUT A PERMIT. A RECENT STUDY PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE TWO DAY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON PERMITTED EIGHTY USE IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA. WITH THOSE NUMBERS IN MINE. I'VE ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY HALF A MILLION ON PERMITTED UNACCOUNTED FOR EIGHTY USE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. THAT NUMBER WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO GROW. THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF A THE U. APPLICATIONS SINCE MY FIRST BILL WENT INTO EFFECT. ARM BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY OF THESE FOLKS END UP LIKE ANDREAS GIULIANA AND JENNIFER. I ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE FOLKS AND UP MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT A PERMIT. SENATE BILL EIGHT THREE ONE WILL ADDRESS THESE REMAINING BARRIERS ENCOURAGE HOMEOWNERS TO BUILD THESE UNITS WITHOUT HAVING TO DO SO. WE'RE LUCKY TODAY MADAM CHAIR TO HAVE WITH US CALL PETERSON WHO'S THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK. BACKYARD REVOLUTION THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENT. I BELIEVE IT'S THE ONLY BOOK IN THE UNITED STATES AND EIGHTY YEARS. AS WELL AS CRAIG MISSION. MISHIMA WHO'S WITH THE HOUSING TRUST OF SILICON VALLEY AND WITH THAT I WOULD URGE AYE VOTE -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CRAIG MIZUSHIMA OF THE CHIEF IMPACT OFFICER FOR THE* HEALTH AND TRUST SILICON VALLEY. ON I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. EIGHT THIRTY ONE IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTY CALIFORNIA LEADERS HAVE ALREADY SHOWN STRONG INTEREST IN REMOVING BARRIERS TO EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENT EVER SINCE HE ADOPTION OF STATE BILLS INTO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MANY CITIES HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THEIR LEADERSHIP IN ALLEVIATING THE HOUSING CRISIS. CRISIS BY INCREASED BY ENCOURAGING THE CREATION OF A TO USE. WHILE SOME MUNICIPALITIES HAVE SHOWN GREAT LEADERSHIP BY RELAXING SOME COLD RESTRICTIONS ON IMPACT FEES. TO ALLOW THEIR DEVELOPMENT IT REMAINS INCONSISTENT CONFUSING AND LIMITED IN SCOPE. LIMITING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT EIGHTY USE CAN HAVE BEEN CREATING HOUSING UNITS. THERE ARE FIFTY TWO SEPARATE CITIES IN THE BAY AREA ALONE. EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENT WILL NEVER REALIZE OUR FULL POTENTIAL IN ACHIEVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS IF WE REQUIRE ALL. FIFTY TWO CITIES TO BASICALLY DEVELOPED SEPARATE STANDARDS PARADING YOU DEVELOPMENT. WHAT WE NEED A STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY YOU? WHAT WE NEED TO STATEWIDE EIGHTY YOU LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT EIGHTY USE CAN BE APPROVED IN A TIMELY MANNER TO ENCOURAGE THEIR USE AND DEVELOPMENT? WHAT WE NEED TO STATEWIDE LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE AN AMNESTY PROGRAM TO RECOGNIZE LEGAL NONCONFORMING UNITS SO THEY CAN HAVE TIME TO COMPLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS? AND BE RECOGNIZED SO THAT THEY CAN NOW CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOCAL PROPERTY TAX BASE IN SUPPORT OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE NEED STATEWIDE LEGISLATION TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE IMPACT FEES RECOGNIZING THAT EIGHTY WAS HAVE VERY LITTLE ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. WHILE HAVING SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL ECONOMIES. WE NEED STATEWIDE EIGHTY YOU LEGISLATION NOW TO ALLOW OUR FAMILIES HEALTHY LIVING ALTERNATIVES TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALTERNATIVES FOR ADULT CHILDREN WHO MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO RELOCATE OUT OF STATE. AND FOR HOUSING OUR AGING PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHO NEED INDEPENDENT HOUSING BUT STILL RELY ON THE COAST FAMILY SUPPORT OF THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. CRITICAL TO HEALTHY LIVING AND A LONGER LIFE. WHAT WE NEED TO STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE THANK YOU? HELLO ADAM MY NAME IS CALL PETERSON I'M AN EIGHTY YEAR EXPERT ADVOCATE AN EDUCATOR BASED IN PORTLAND OREGON AND AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK BACK DOOR REVOLUTION THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO EAT. PDU DEVELOPMENT. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY -- EIGHTY IS THAT ONE OF THE LEAST EXPENSIVE WAYS TO DEVELOP HOUSING IN EXISTING CITIES IF NOT THE LEAST EXPENSIVE WAY TO DO SO. EIGHTIES PROVIDED NATURALLY -- AFFORDABLE WANTED TO PERSON SIZED HOME IN A WALKABLE LIKABLE TRANSIT ORIENTED AREAS EIGHTY USE ARE DISCREET. EVEN IN RARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH EIGHTY USE ARE LOCATED ON ADJACENT LOTS NEIGHBORS CAN'T EVEN TELL THEIR THEIR FROM THE STREET. IT IS OUR ENERGY EFFICIENT. THEY'RE TYPICALLY BUILT THE MORE LOCATION EFFICIENT AREAS AND THERE ONE QUARTER TO ONE THIRD THE SIZE OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSE. SMALLER HOMES INTRINSICALLY AND DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE HEATING AND COOLING COSTS OF RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS. FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY OTHERS EIGHTY USER THEORETICALLY IN DEAR. BAG GOT DIDN'T SEIZE POLICYMAKERS URBAN PLANNERS ECONOMISTS ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND ADVOCATES FOR ACCESSIBLE DESIGN SENIOR HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT IN FACT IT IS A COMMONLY DISFAVORED IN PRACTICE THROUGH MUNICIPAL ZONING CODE. FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY USE ARE THE ONE AND ONLY HOUSING FORUM IN THE UNITED STATES WHEREIN SOME MUNICIPALITIES BURDEN HOMEOWNER WITH THE SIGNIFICANT USE RESTRICTION. BY WHICH I REFERRED TO EARLIER UNDER OCCUPANCY VEHICLE ORDINANCES. THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE SO COMMONPLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE THAT THEY NOW MAY SEEM NORMAL BUT THEY'RE NOT. THEY PENALIZE THE EXISTENCE OF A LIAM LEGAL ATO AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR FOSTERING ADDITIONAL ON PERMITTED UNITS. NO OTHER HOUSING TYPES MUST CONTEND WITH A SIGNIFICANT MUNICIPAL DE. I RESTRICTION NOT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES NOT DUPLEXES NOR TYPE LEX'S NOR FOR PARKS IS NOT MULTI FAMILY. ALL OF WHICH ARE FORMS OF RENTAL HOUSING IN THE SAME MUNICIPALITIES. BUT EIGHTY USE AND IT IS A LOAN COMMONLY TRIGGER THIS MUNICIPAL POISON PILL. YOUR VOTE OF SUPPORT FOR THIS HOUSING TYPE BENEATH SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE HISTORY THIS IS NOT A SUPERLATIVE. THE PASSAGE OF SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE WOULD BRING ABOUT NATIONALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FOR EIGHTY YEARS IT WOULD ENABLE MORE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BOTH APPRAISERS AND LENDERS TO ASSIST HOMEOWNERS TO OVERCOME THE COST THE CONSTRUCTION OF EIGHT YEARS. THEY MAY BE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE HOUSING FORM OF HOUSING TO DEVELOP BUT EVEN SO. EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR HOMEOWNERS TO COME UP WITH A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SPARE FUNDS TO BUILD. ONE INDEED EVEN WHERE EIGHTY REGULATIONS ARE PERFECT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION AND CHECK CHALLENGES OF HOUSING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR AMATEUR HOMEOWNER DEVELOPERS. REMAINS AS A FORMIDABLE BARRIER TO THEIR PROLIFERATION. THIS TESTIMONY MARKSMAN MOST SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT WITH ANY STATE LEGISLATION TO DATE MY PRESENCE HERE TODAY ALL THE WAY FROM OREGON IS A TESTAMENT TO HOW CRITICAL I BELIEVE THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL IS FOR THE NET FOR THIS NATURALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING TYPE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL OR THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND PROUD SUPPORT. CLOSELY AS FOR MY VOTE GREAT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS MICHAEL MCLAUGHLIN VOLUNTEER WITH A A RP AARP STRONGLY SUPPORTS S. B. A THIRTY ONE THANK YOU.

MY CLAIM WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT. TIFFANY FAN OF HOW THE BRIDGE HOUSING IT'S PART. IT AFTERNOON BLACK SHEPHERD REPRESENTING IN SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN SUPPORT. NO ONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. THING AND NONE OTHER NEW IN THIS IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BURRS CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION. I'M I THINK IN ALICE'S DOES A GOOD JOB OUTLINING SOME OF THE KEY CONCERNS THATWE'VE RAISED ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION BUT I THINK AN IMPORTANT ONE IS ALL OF THE DIFFERENCES I BELIEVE THERE'S TEN ENUMERATED IN THE ANALYSIS. BETWEEN THIS BILL AND BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT NINETY WHICH ALSO I'M WAS PASSED OUT OF THE COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS YEAR. I'M ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES THAT I THINK IS OF CONCERN TO US IS THE FACT THAT S. B. THREE ONE INCLUDES LANGUAGE THAT SINCE ESSENTIALLY TURNS THE EXITS WE DRAWING UNIT. LAW ON ITS HEAD REQUIRING BASICALLY AN OPT OUT APPROACH IN TERMS OF AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SAFETY OR OTHER HAZARDS WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO INTENSIFY RESIDENTIAL USES. AND THE REASON THAT'S ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT IS BECAUSE THIS BILL SAYS THAT THOSE LIMITED RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF WHERE THERE'S A HEALTH AND SAFETY AREA FOR INSTANCE IF THERE'S A HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY AREA IF THERE'S AN AREA THAT'S PRONE TO LANDSLIDES. RIGHT NOW ALL OF THOSE AREAS CAN DO YOU BUY RIGHT CONVERSIONS WITH IN EXISTING SPACE BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS EXPANDS THAT BY RIGHT PROCESS TO UP TO TWO UNITS FOR OUTSIDE OF AND MULTI FAMILY BUILDING. AND FOR STANDALONE EIGHTY YOU SO IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF THE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED SINCE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN LEGISLATION IS PASSED. I'M ANOTHER AREA OF CONTENTION THAT WE HAVE WITH THE AUTHOR IS ABOUT THE IMPOSITION OF LIMITS ON PARCEL SIZE AND FOR RURAL COUNTIES AND FOR SMALLER CITIES AND PLACES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE URBAN OF WATER AND SEWER SYSTEMS BUT RATHER PEOPLE USE WELL AND SEPTIC. THOSE PARCEL SIZE LIMITATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT A HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACT TO WATER SUPPLY. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT SCREENING CRITERIA BECAUSE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS IF YOU REMOVE PARCEL SIZE LIMITATIONS IN THOSE CONTACTS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME INTO THE PERMIT COUNTER THINKING THEY CAN GET AND EIGHTY YOU. THAT'S REALLY NOT GONNA BE IN MINISTERIAL PROCESS ANYMORE BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AT THE SEPTIC AT THE WELL AND SO YOU'RE SETTING PEOPLE UP. I BELIEVE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT AND FOR A COSTLY ENDEAVOR WHEN WE KNOW THERE'S LEGITIMATE POLICY REASONS TO RESTRICT THE PROLIFERATION OF SEPTIC TANKS ON IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S A HIGH DENSITY OF THOSE. AND THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD PASSED REGULATIONS ON RELATING TO ON SITE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS COUNTIES THAT HAVE INCLUDED PARCEL SIZE LIMITATIONS THE ORDINANCES. HAVE CONSIDERED THAT REQUIREMENT IN DEVELOPING THOSE OR THINK IT'S AGAINST GOOD PUBLIC POLICY TO COMPLETELY REMOVE PARCEL SIZE LIMITATIONS. ON WITHOUT I THINK I'LL. BUT AT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES TALK ABOUT THE OTHER CONCERNS THANK YOU. YES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JASON RYAN LEE CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. I'M I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT EXISTING LAW IS ALREADY VERY ROBUST WHEN IT COMES EIGHTY USE THANKS TO SOMEWHERE BLOOM AND CENTER WHITE HOUSE KEYS BILLS FROM TWO YEARS AGO. SO IT'S NOT AS IF WE DON'T HAVE VERY RESTRICTIVE LAWS NOW ON WHAT CITIES CANNING CAN DO WITH REGARD TO REGULATE EIGHTY USE. AND THEY'RE ALSO VERY INCLUSIVE OF ALLOWING FOR NEED YOU TO BE CONSTRUCTED THE LEGISLATURE UMBEL IN TWO YEARS AGO I WAS VERY MINDFUL IN AND WANTING TO RESTRICT SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO SPUR. EIGHTY USE WE KNOW THE LAW IS WORKING AND IT'S WORKING VERY WELL IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE LOS ANGELES HAS SEEN A TWENTY FIVE TIMES INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EIGHTY PERMITS ISSUED. SANFRANCISCO HAS SEEN A TWELVE TIMES INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EIGHTY YOU PERMITS ISSUED SO JUST SINGING VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WE KNOW THE LAWS WORKING. SO WE QUESTION WHY WE NEED TO TURN THE LAW ON ITS HEAD YET AGAIN AND HAVE OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES GO THROUGH AN ORDINANCE PROCESS TO UPDATE THAT LAW THAT'S JUST BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR TWO YEARS. AND WE'VE SEEN LEGISLATION LAST YEAR AND HE REALLY QUESTION WHY WE NEED. ANOTHER THING THAT WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THIS BILL IS ALLOWING FOR TWO EIGHTY USED TO BE ON A PARCEL ONE THAT CAN BE DETACHED ONE THAT. CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE HOME THIS GOES BEYOND A THINK WHAT MOST PEOPLE ENVISIONED WHEN CITIES ARE GONNA BE RESTRICTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO IMPOSE PARKING REGULATIONS. WE'RE ADDING CONSIDERABLE DENSITY TOUR SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS WITHOUT ANY ABILITY FOR US TO IMPOSE PARKING RESTRICTIONS IF YOU'RE WITHIN A HALF MILE. OF A P. TRANSIT STOP OR OTHERS TO WRITE YOUR CAR NEARBY SO WE BELIEVE THIS MEASURE GOES WAY BEYOND WAS ENVISIONED NOT ONLY FOR PARKING. BUT ALSO WE THINK OF EIGHTY USE WE THINK OF AS GRANNY FLATS ARE IN LAW QUARTERS ON THIS CAN BE USED WITHOUT THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT. AS AN INVESTOR TOOL TO COME IN AND BUY UP UNITS HAD TO READ USE EACH ONE AND READ THEM ALL OUT BECAUSE THERE'S NO AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL. WE ASSUME THAT THEY'LL BE MORE FORMAL BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THE ONLY WAY THE LEGISLATURE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN GUARANTEE AFFORDABILITY IS SUPPLY DEED RESTRICTIONS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN WITH THAT WE OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE AREA WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION LEARNED ABLE ANSWER REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION. TWO MEN OF OR SOME HAVE THE URBAN KINDS OF CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON TRACY RYAN ROEKIAH REPRESENTS CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR DAVID JONES A MATH CITIES IN MARIN BURBANK NEAR IT AND SAN MARCOS IN OPPOSITION. KILOMETER THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE FOR A NOT POSITION. SING THEN WE WILL GO AHEAD MOVE INTO ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. WELL SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY HOPE WE FIND OURSELVES IN A VERY UNUSUAL AND UNCOMFORTABLE. A SITUATION RIGHT NOW -- YOU AND I AT AS AS YOU MENTIONED TO WHERE THEY AUTHORS OF THE THE TWO BILLS THAT. GOT ALL TWO YEARS AGO WE SEE A GREAT DEAL OF SUCCESS THEIR ARTISTS IN THIS PICKLE. THOUSANDS IF UNITS THAT ARE -- THAT ARE -- EITHER PERMITTED UNDER CONSTRUCTION ALREADY BUILT NOW AND THE OF THE LAWS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS AND THEN LAST YEAR WE SAW A CLEAN UP LEGISLATION AND IN EACH OF THE A A OF THE YEARS OR FOLLOWING EACH OF THE OF THESE YEARS DUE TO THE CHANGES IN THE LAW THAT WE'VE MADE CITIES HAVE. HAD TO UPDATE THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCES AND AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE -- IS IS THAT SOME OF THOSE ORDINANCES ARE JUST GOING INTO EFFECT NOW OUR HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN COMPLETE COMPLETELY DONE AND SO WERE ASKING CITIES. TO DO A LOT HERE ON THE ON ON THE SAME SUBJECT. I I THINK THAT -- THAT THAT YOUR A BILL TRIES TO FIX ON IMPORTANT PROBLEMS -- INCLUDING THE ISSUES RELATING TO LOT SIZE LIKE COVERAGE FLOOR AREA RATIO AND DEALING WITH FEES THERE THERE ARE IN SOME PLACES -- I'VE GOTTEN THE SAME OF COMPLAINTS I GOT A LIST FOR WORKING ON ONE IN MY OFFICE -- TO OF OF ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP. SETBACKS AND AND AND AND WHAT HAVE YOU -- OF THE FEES A BEEN A PROBLEM -- YOU ADDRESS INCREASINGLY ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OF A CD WHICH I THINK IS A A IS SOMETHING THAT'S IN IT AND IMPORTANT [inaudible] I AND FRANKLY SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS ARE THE ONES THAT OF CITIES -- A USED TO UNDERMINE STATE AID YOU LAWS AND THE REASON THAT WE HAD TO BRING OUR LEGISLATION IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE OF MANY CITIES HAD. LAWS PER THEY WERE SO RESTRICTIVE THAT IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD THEM -- WE WERE AWARE OF YOUR WITNESSES BOOK -- AND TO WORK BY OTHER FOLKS -- TO KNEW THAT TO THE EIGHTY YOU COULD BE A NOT THE ONLY BUT A SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN SHORTAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IT'S PROVEN TO HAVE BEEN AND AN ACCURATE PREDICTION THAT WOULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE I SO I'M AT HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT -- AND TO FACING A VERY UNCERTAIN OUTCOME HERE -- I KNOW THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING HAS A BILL I THINK SENATOR SKINNER AT ONE POINT IN TIME HAD HAD A BILL WHY I'M ONLY SAYING THAT BECAUSE I KNOW SHE EXPRESSED INTEREST I THINK THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE INTEREST. I HAVE INTERESTED IN CONTINUING -- TO TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT. OF AND I JUST WANT TO COMMIT THAT -- TO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE PROBABLY THIS YEAR TO TAKE A PAUSE -- AND AND AND ALLOW CITIES TO CATCH UP AND CATCH THEIR BREATH IT'S NOT THAT THIS THERE ARE THERE ARE PLACES. WHERE THE LAW NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED THEY SHOULD BE DOING -- AND WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT -- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LET. ALL OF THE CITIES THAT HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING AND THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD WE NEED TO ALLOW THEM TO CATCH THEIR BREATH -- MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT'S MORE A A COMPATIBLE ANYTHING FOR ALL OF US. YEAH WE ALSO EXPECT. A SUMMARY RIVER FELT OKAY OPEN. THE SUMMER WALDRON. THANK YOU LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING I CAN. I'M TAKING GO TAKE IT OKAY -- RICHER WHEN SHE THOUGHT I TALK COUPLE CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL TO SAY WITH A MY PIECE -- IN THE BILL ON PAGE NINE ACTUAL BILL LANGUAGE THAT MAYBE I'M READING IT WRONG BUT IT BASICALLY SAYS NO. MINIMUM OR MAXIMIZE FOR THE EIGHTY TWO BASED ON PERCENTAGE OF PROPOSED EXISTING PRIMARY DWELLING. IT'S THEIR BE ESTABLISHED BASICALLY CAN'T BE LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET IS THE WAY I'M READING IT. DO THE EIGHT HUNDRED FEET WOULD BE RIGHT FOR MEN A MUSCLE. SO WHAT WE SAW IS THAT THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN PEOPLE HAD A PRE EXISTING LARGE HOME AND PEOPLE HAD A SMALL HOME SOME PEOPLE HAVE A SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT. AND THEY HAVE A EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY A SQUARE FOOT HOUSE THAT'S ON THERE RIGHT NOW THAT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE AND THEN THE TWO LOCAL ORDINANCE THAT LIMIT THE SIZE BASED ON THE PRE EXISTING HOME. YOU COULD ONLY FILL FOREIGN TWENTY FIVE AND IF YOU HAD A SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE YOU COULD BUILD THE TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT FEET. SO. UNDER UNDER A BIG. TEN SIXTY NINE AND TWO TWO NINE I DID THE ORIGINAL. A EIGHTY YOU BILL SO THIS IS THIS IS AIMED AT NOT HAVING. MODEST HOMEOWNERS WHO WANTED TO DO PUT IN A A A UNIT ON A MODEST HOUSE WITH A MODEST SIZED PRE EXISTING HOME THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED VERSUS SOMEBODY HAD A LARGE LOT. IF IF THAT IS CLEAR WOULD IT ALSO THEN SAY IF YOU HAVE I MEAN SOME OF MY AREAS THE OLDER CLUB. CONSTRUCTION WAS YOU KNOW MAYBE FIFTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HER. NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOME. YOU KNOW ON A TWO ACRE LOT. COULD THEY BUILD A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT AID YOU. IN NOT UNDER THIS LEGISLATION NOT I MEAN THE THE TEN SIXTY NINE CAPTIVE AT LEAST FOR THE STATE AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THAT WAS THAT WAS THE MAX ON YOU KNOW. KILEY WAS WRITTEN HERE WASN'T SURE JUST SAYS LET ME ESTABLISH. A LOCAL AGENCY MAY ESTABLISH A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM. BUT IT CAN'T BE BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE EXISTING DWELLING UNIT SO I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT RIGHT THIS WAS THIS WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT I TOOK THAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL. NANCY SKINNER RAFEAL TING BILL ABOUT SETTING THIS UP ALLOWING PEOPLE TO BUY RIGHT TO GET TO EIGHT HUNDRED FEET THE ORIGINAL BILL SAID. AS A MEMBER BLOOM WHEN I HAD HAD NO MINIMUM WE DID WE SAID NO MINIMUM BUT THEY IF YOU WERE ON AYE USING YOUR PRE EXISTING HOME YOU WHAT YOU COULD GET UP. TO YOU CAN GET LARGER THAN TWELVE MINUTES AT THIS WAS LANGUAGE THAT I ACCEPTED AS PART OF THAT NEGOTIATIONS IN THIS LONG JOURNEY. CLINTON I THAT THAT ARE IN THEIR CITY BUT THEY WANT TO SAY THAT A CITY COULDN'T STOP YOU OR COULDN'T YOU HAD A WRITER FOR IT EIGHT HUNDRED FOOT UNIT. IN THE SHORTER SO WE HAD TO DEAL WITH A BUILDING A GARAGE JUST THE SAME RIGHTS AS LIMITED -- OKAY SO SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES. HOW DOES THE WATER AND SEWER FEES GET COVERED I MEAN? AND BUILDING ANOTHER LIVINGS. STRUCTURE AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER THERE'S YOU KNOW. THE PERMITTING FEES OR THE HOOKUP FEES LIBERAL INVOLVED OF WATER AND SEWER HOOKUPS. WELL. TO YOUR FOCUS MY CITIES HAVE THEIR OWN WATER RECLAMATION AND TREATMENT. SO TWO YEARS AGO I WAS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND WE HAD A BILL THE TEN SIXTY NINE GOT RID OF ALL THE FEES. GOT RID OF ALL THE FEES AND THE WATER DISTRICTS CAME IN AND THEY SAY WE DON'T GET THE MONEY UP FRONT FROM PROP THIRTEEN WE NEED TO HAVE SOME PEACE WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT. HERE THAT SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE NO FEES BUT THE SEWER DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET PROPORTIONAL TO THE SIZE. BECAUSE THE THEORY WAS THAT WHEN THEY BUILT MY THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH THEY EXPECTED MOMMY AND DADDY AND JIMMY AND JACKIE TO LIVE IN THE HOUSE THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE. NOW YOU GO THROUGH MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN YOU HAVE TO PEOPLE LIVING IN A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IN ANOTHER. SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT UNIT IT'S NOT HOW THAT. SEWER SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED BY DOING THAT IT WAS DESIGNED. FOR MOMMY AND DADDY ENGINE IN JACQUI RIGHT SO SO IF YOU IF YOU COULD SHOW THAT THAT HAD A STRESS PROPORTIONALLY TO WHAT. WHO WAS LIVING THERE THEN THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO AND IT WAS ON THEM TO SHOW IT UNFORTUNATELY? AS SOON AS THE BILL WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THE WATER DISTRICT SAID THAT SINCE THE BILL DIDN'T NAME THEM IN THE IN THE DEBT IN THE LEGISLATION THAN THEY WERE NO LONGER. CONTROLLED BY HIGH. S. B. TEN SIXTY NINE SO THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO DO THE CLEANUP LANGUAGE SO THERE WAS A HARD. GOOD I TOOK A GOOD FAITH AMENDMENTS. TO DEAL WITH THE WATER DISTRICTS AND THEN THEY SAID THAT WE DON'T APPLY SO NOW THEY THEY AGREE THAT THEY HAVE A PROPORTIONAL FEE SO. THE I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTY THERE'S NO CONVERSION THERE'S NO FEE FOR CONVERSION YOU KNOW. CAN CONVERSION DISPROPORTIONAL OR NEW THERE'S NO. YOU KNOW FEE THAT YOU WE GET I THINK THE QUESTION THAT THE COUNTIES WERE SAYING ON THESE OUTLINING. AREAS THAT HAVE SET SIX THAT HAVE UP PORTIONS THE BEST FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS YOU CAN. BECAUSE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY OR BECAUSE HE KNOW FIRE WHATEVER CITIES TO JURISDICTIONS CAN COME IN AND SAY THESE CAN HAVE NO BAR. EIGHTY USE I HAVE IN FREMONT WE HAVE A LANDSLIDE AREA THAT IS YOU CAN SEE THE SCAR ON THE HILL AND THEN YOU SEE THE TRACK TONES THAT ARE RIGHT THERE. IF THE CITY CAME IN AND SAID NOT IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW POTENTIAL EARTHQUAKES AND LANDSLIDES SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING THAT THE LANGUAGE WOULD GIVE. THAT FLEXIBILITY TO THEM IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION WELL BECAUSE I HAVE A LETTER IN ALL THOSE BONTA LETTERS ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE SAYS -- THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF NEW UNITS ON THE WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM COULD CREATE FINANCIAL STRAINS FOR SOME AGENCIES. RESULTING IN A RATE HIKE ON EXISTING CUSTOMERS. WHO'VE ALREADY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE SO BASICALLY OTHER. PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE WILL HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF THE WATER AND SEWER HOOKUPS BECAUSE IT'S NOT DELINEATE THERE'S ANOTHER. NOTE I HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT FEES AND THINGS THAT CITIES CAN CHARGE BUT WATER AND SEWER IS NOT ONE OF ME I MEAN MAYBE PART OF THAT IS THE THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON PERMANENT UNITS THAT ARE HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE SYSTEM ALREADY. THAT THE BILL HOPES TO BRING OUT -- YOU KNOW I I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL HOLD TIME BECAUSE I'M FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO MUNICIPALITIES THERE BUT GENERALLY YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE SEEING THIS IMPACT IS IN THAT SUBURBAN. FOOTPRINT THE FIVE THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT WIDE BIG ADMITTEDLY THERE'S OTHERS THERE'S OTHER TYPES HOUSING TYPE BUT THIS IS WHERE. THE THE THE ACTIVITIES GOING YOU KNOW UTILITIES CAN STILL CHARGE AT THE USAGE RATE YOU KNOW ONE AND THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A PRESUMABLY IF YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE THERE IN THEIR TAKE MORE SHOWERS AND WHATEVER. THAT WILL DO BUT AGAIN THE ORIGINAL TEN AND SIXTY NINE HAS THE PROPORTIONAL FEE IN THERE SAID THAT THE SEWER SYSTEMS IN THE WATER SYSTEM. ARE ABLE TO CHARGE AROUND THE AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE YOUR MIND VISITS THAT HOOKED UP SOMETIMES A MYERS TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT. TO RUN YOU KNOW A LINE YEAH AND THEN AGAIN IT'S A PROPORTIONAL FOR THE NEW UNITS I AND I DID A FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FOOT ADDITION ON TO MY HOUSE DIDN'T PAY ANYTHING I ONE DAY PERMIT ONE IN. IF I WANT TO BILL AND I PUT IN ANOTHER. CAN THAT THE SINK ANOTHER STOVE AND A BATHROOM WHY DID THIS SORT OF THAT IT'S STILL IN MY KITCHEN IN MY HOUSE BUT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CONCEPT THAT THE PROPORTIONALITY IS THAT WILL YOU CHARGE ME FOR THIS. SO JUST AND JUST [inaudible] LAST. POINTS ALL THROWN INTO ONE THING LIKE IN MY AREA. PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR AWESOME Y. I HAVE A PROBLEM SUPPORTING AID YOU BILLS IN GENERAL. IS THAT. WE HAVE. YOU KNOW VERY OLD URBAN. AREAS SOME OF OUR PART IN MY CITY. A COUPLE OF THE LOWEST INCOME CENSUS TRACKS IN THE NATION. YOU KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE YOU KNOW INCOME IS BETWEEN THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ON THE HIGH UP TO FORTY TWO THOUSAND FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS. YOU KNOW OUR CITIES GENERALLY HAVE OPPOSED BUILDING THE SECOND DWELLING UNITS BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS WE ALREADY HAVE MULTIPLE FAMILIES LIVING IN UNITS. THERE ONLY MADE FOR FOUR PEOPLE UP TO TWENTY NINE PEOPLE IN ONE HOME WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY'RE CONVERTING GARAGES AND ALL OF SO WE HAVE. A LOT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES CARS SPILLING OUT ONTO THE STREETS BLOCKING OTHER PEOPLE'S ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT CALLS WE GOT WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL WAS THE CARS BLOCKING PEOPLE'S DRIVEWAYS. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE LIVING IN UNITS. THAT WEREN'T EVEN MADE FOR THE AMOUNT OF HILL SAYS FAMILY. FOR THIRTEEN FIFTEEN PEOPLE ON ONE EIGHT TEN CARS PER HOUSE SO. YOU KNOW THE ELIMINATING THE OFF STREET PARKING IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR A LOT OF OUR CITIES -- DO OWNER OCCUPANCY PART WAS SOMETHING OUR CITIES. REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS GRAINY OR SOMEONE IS THERE TO ACTUALLY WATCH THIS ACTION BEING TAKEN CARE OF TOM I JUST GOT A CALL THIS WEEK. THAT I HAVE TO SUBMIT TO THE CODE ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I DON'T DO THAT THING ANYMORE SINCE ONLINE ON THE COUNCIL. ABOUT IT ONE OF THESE LITTLE DWELLING ANSWERED BILL THAT RIGHT UP AGAINST THE FENCE. AND PEOPLE LIVING IN IT AND THAT'S JUST. AN I ON THIS AND THE OTHER PART BECAUSE WE WANT THEM PERMITTED. WE WANT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO KNOW THAT THEIR AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S YOU KNOW. IT'S AN ISSUE IN OUR DISTRICT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THOSE THINGS. SOME WERE VOEPEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY DISTRICT [inaudible] BORDERS. ON NAM WALDRON IS DISTRICT. AND WE'RE LOW BUT DIFFERENT. MANY OF MY CITIES AND THE CITY I WAS MAYOR OF WHEN THOUGH A GRANNY FLAT LAW CAME OUT. WE LOVED IT IT WAS GREAT. WE STARTED BUILDING A LOT A GRANNY FLATS BECAUSE IT CUT OUT ALL THE PAPERWORK TO CUT OUT A LOT OF STUFF IT IT REALLY WORK WONDERFUL FOR US. THIS BILL I STRONGLY SUPPORT FOR THE SAME REASON -- WERE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION UNITS SHORTEN CALIFORNIA THIS HELPS. THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THE BENEFITS VETERANS SENIORS DISABLE. MILLENNIALS MILLENNIALS I MEAN YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE MANY. BASEMENTS IN -- CALIFORNIA'S SO YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT JOKE BUT DOES A LOT OF MILLENNIALS IN THE SPARE BEDROOM THIS GET SOME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GET SOME SOMEWHERE ELSE -- THERE COULD BE SUMMER EXPLOITATION AS FAR AS THE MARKET GOES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT. YOU'RE ABLE TO BUILD A GRANNY FLAT AND RENTED OUT TO SOMEONE ELSE NOT YOUR GRANNY OKAY WITH ME [inaudible] IT'S GREATLY -- PRODUCING HOUSING SO SENATOR I THINK THIS IS SPOT ON I SUPPORT IT AND I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT IT [inaudible] THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT SEE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SO -- I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION FOR THIS. AND I UNDERSTAND -- WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET -- TO BUT THIS COMMITTEE ALREADY PASSED IN APRIL THIS YEAR -- A BILL AB YOU LOST IT FOR A YEAR LAW AB TWENTY EIGHT NINE DIFFERENT TING AND WE WORKED REALLY HARD. TO GET THAT BILL OUT HERE AND WE THINK IT DID THE RIGHT THING -- MISTER TING SO MEMBER TING NARROW THE SCOPE OF HIS BILL AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMMITTEE INCLUDING REVERTING THE FEE PROVISIONS BACK TO EXISTING LAW. WHICH IS ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS I ASKED HIM TO TAKE AS COMMON GUT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. GIVEN THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY READ IT THAT THE POLICY IN AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY TING AND MANY CONFLICTS THAT YOUR BILL HAS WITH AB. TWENTY NINETY I'M NOT ENOUGH SUPPORT TO BUILD A DAY -- IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OKAY. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MOTION SO MOVED. MOVED A BILL SO WE DON'T HAVE A SECOND SO DO THE LACK OF A MOTION THIS BILL WILL BE HELD IN COMMITTEE THANK YOU. I NEXT WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER FOUR SP TEN EIGHTEEN ROOSTER ALAN. SOME A SENATOR ALAN YEAH VOTE. SO MISTER ALLEN HERE ITEM NUMBER. FOUR AND IT -- WE'RE READY TO GO APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE MEMBERS AND I YOU KNOW I I I'M MYSELF CHAIRING A COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE. SO WHERE. A PROCEDURE PATIENTS SO THIS BILL S. B. TEN EIGHTEEN BUILDS UPON PASS LEGISLATION BY GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMMUNICATIVE. SIX AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT HYBRID OR ADVISORY COMMISSIONS. AND THEN MAKE VERY AND THAT ALSO MAKES VERY SOON TO STREAMLINING CLARIFY THE LAW. ALLOWING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CREATE THIRD WE DISTURBING COMMISSIONS. THE BEGINNING WITH THE APPROVAL OF PROPOSITION. ELEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHICH CREATED THE CITIZENS WERE DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS THAT ONE KNOWS ABOUT. AYE INDEPENDENT REISSUE COMMISSIONS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO STIR CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOW ARE SEAT ASSEMBLY OUR STATE SENATE. OR BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OUR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS ARE ALL DRAWN. BY THESE INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS. NOW DRIVEN BY YOU KNOW A LOT OF INTEREST IN NON PARTISAN REDISTRICTING AYE. AUTHORED S. B. ELEVEN AWAY IT BACK TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH AUTHORIZES ALL COUNTIES AND CITIES. TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT OR ADVISORY RESTRICT COMMISSIONS ARE NOW THIRTEEN DIFFERENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM THE UC DIEGO IT MODESTO OAKLAND SACRAMENTO THEY'VE ALL NOW ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS. SO THIS BILL BUILT UPON THAT PASSED LEGISLATION BY NOW GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMMUNICATIVE SYSTRACE. SPECIAL DISTRICTS THIS AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH THESE INDEPENDENT. A HYBRID OR ADVISORY COMMISSIONS IT'LL BRING MORE TRANSPARENT IN NON PARTISAN REDISTRICTING TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT IMPORTANTLY THE BILL PROVIDES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WITH THE CHOICE. TO UTILIZE INDEPENDENT HYBRID OR ADVISORY PRESERVING COMMISSIONS DOESN'T MANDATE THAT IF THEY DO SO ON THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIES IT STREAMLINES CURRENT LAW. TO ENSURE A SMOOTH PROCESS FOR REDISTRICTING AFTER THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. AND SOME OF THOSE CHANGES INVOLVED ALONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S A CONTRACT WITH THAT COUNTIES INDEPENDENT REDUCING COMMISSION BUT REQUIRING THE COMMISSION TO HOLD AT LEAST THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS. IN THE LOCAL JURISDICTION BEFORE ADOPTING THE BOUNDARIES PROHIBITING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES THAT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A POLITICAL PARTY PROHIBITING LEGISLATIVE BOUNDARIES FROM REPEALING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN. BY ONE OF THE COMMISSIONS ARE AND THEN ALSO REDUCING BY OR INDEPENDENT HYPER COMMISSION AND THE REDUCING SOME QUALIFICATIONS AND POST SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. I TO ALLOW MORE CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS WE GOT A GREAT LIST OF SUPPORTERS OUT HERE WE HAVE TODAY AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT NICHOLS HIGH DURING HIS. REPRESENTING COMMON CAUSE OR ROSE IS ALSO PRESENTING WHAT BUT XANDER NOT DOOR ROSE OKAY -- REPRESENT LEAGUE WOMEN VOTERS IN THAT RESPECT YES RIGHT VOTE. GREAT LET'S HEAR FROM ME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS NICOLAS I DON'T WITH CALIFORNIA COME BECAUSE IN STRONG SUPPORT. COME BECAUSE FIRMLY SPORTS USE OF INDEPENDENT COMMISSION REDUCE TING INCLUDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. STUDIES OF INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS LIKE CALIFORNIA'S COMMISSION FINALLY TYPICALLY DO A BETTER JOB THAN LET'S OF BODIES DURING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES LONG A NUMBER OF METRICS INCLUDING KEEPING CITIES COMMUNITIES NEVER TOLL PROMOTING PARTISAN FAIRNESS. THOSE INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINORITY REPRESENTATION. AS OTHER MENTIONING CALIFORNIA SINCE CHRISTMAS DAY COMMISSION WE'VE SEEN A SURGE OF INTEREST AND LOCAL CONNECTIONS AT THE LOCAL. THERE FOURTEEN JURISDICTIONS DAVID NOW HAVE INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS RECOGNITION THIS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED S. B. ELEVEN WAY TO ALLOW COUNTIES IN GENERAL US AT LEAST CREE COMMISSIONS. THIS BILL DOES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT THINGS BUILDING OFF OF THAT AUTHORITY THAT LEGISLATURE'S RT STYLISH. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY NOW ALLOWS ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT WISHES TO ESTABLISH COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO. IF REDUCING IS A BEST PRACTICE FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES WE SEE NO REASON WHY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS SHOULD ALSO HAVE THAT OPTION. TO CREATE COMMISSION'S IF THEY WISH. TO BILLS TO FINE TUNE SOME THE REQUIREMENTS ON LOCAL COMMISSIONS ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENTS IS TO PROHIBIT ANY DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF POLITICAL PARTIES SHOULD SOMEONE GO AHEAD AND CREATE. AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. FINALLY THE BILL ALSO RELAXES SOME OF THE COMMISSIONER OLD ABILITY OF SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THIS IS REALLY RECOGNITION. SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE A SMALLER POOL OF POTENTIAL HOPKINS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR ALL JURISDICTION WILL ADOPT THESE COMMISSIONS. FINALLY THE BILL JUST THREE WORDS SOME PROVISIONS TO MAKE EXISTING LAW CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE TO SPECIFY THAT ALTHOUGH THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION TALKS Y. RESISTING. COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO BE CREATED IN THE DISTRICTING CONTACTS WHICH SWING DISTRICT LINES ARE BEING SELFISH FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO CONCLUDE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A LEADER ON STATE AND FEDERAL REDISTRICTING AND WITH THIS BILL WE THINK WILL CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER ON LOCAL REDUCING WE STRONGLY OR SPORT THANK YOU. HI I'M ANDREAS FISCHER WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS THAT CALIFORNIA FILLING IN FOR DOOR ROSE I'M ANYTHING GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES -- TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ITS S. B.. TEN EIGHTEEN SO WE AT THE LEAGUE -- SUPPORT REDISTRICTING -- PROCESS THAT IS STRUCTURED TO PROMOTE FAIR AND EFFECTIVE REPRESENTS REPRESENTATION -- AND THAT ALLOWS FOR A HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLIC. ABILITY FOR REDISTRICTING SHOULD BE VESTED IN AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION WITH DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP. THAT IS A COMMISSION THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY REPRESENT THE PUBLIC OVERALL WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF MINORITY GROUPS. WE REJECT SYSTEMS THAT PROTECT INCUMBENTS AND ONES THAT PROVIDE PREFER -- PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ANY POLITICAL PARTY [inaudible] I AND WE BELIEVE MAINTAIN THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROCESS IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. I S. B. TEN EIGHTEEN PROVIDES IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL AND TEN UP S. B. AT ELEVEN OO. EIGHT AS YOU'VE HEARD IT WOULD CLARIFY BOTH AT THE LA TIMES TO INITIAL DISTRICTING AND THAT -- HYBRID COMMISSIONS I HAVE TO MEET THE SAME STANDARDS OF INDEPENDENCE AND TRANSPARENCY. AS INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS. ON THIS BILL -- WOULD REMOVE BARRIERS THAT COMPLICATE THE CREATION OFLOCAL NONPARTISAN COMMISSIONS -- AT AT THE SAME TIME IT BROADENS THE JURISDICTION JURISDICTIONS THAT MAY ESTABLISH INDEPENDENCE -- COMMISSIONS BEYOND COUNTIES AND CITIES. S. B. TEN AT TEN EIGHTEEN WILL STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO FAIR AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. AND IT -- DEMONSTRATES HER RESOLVE TO GIVE THE PEOPLE I THE POWER TO CHOOSE THEIR POLITICIANS. I FOR THESE REASONS THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS S. B. TEN EIGHTEEN AND STRONGLY ENCOURAGES. A YES VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. ENGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. AND THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. APPEARS THAT THERE ARE NONE. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] THE MOTION. AND A QUESTION. WITH WALDRON SOME TRYING I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE SO MY QUESTION IS -- SO A LOT OF THESE LOCAL. ARE THESE OFFICES ARE NONPARTISAN TO BEGIN. RIGHT SO THE ENTITY WOULD CHOOSE ITS OWN PEOPLE SAY OF CITY COUNCIL. WOULD DO SOME TYPE OF PROCESS BY WHICH THEY APPOINT MEMBERS TO BE ON THE COMMISSION. AND THEN THEY ACT INDEPENDENTLY THE GOAL IS THERE INDEPENDENT -- SOLD GENERALLY JUST NATURALLY I WOULD ASSUME IF YOU HAVE THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS SAY FOR MEMBERS OF ONE PARTY IN. ONE OF ANOTHER THEY WOULD CREATIVE COMMISSION THAT. WOULD REPRESENT THAT OR IF IT WAS THE OFFICES YOU KNOW MAYBE TO TO IN TO AN INDEPENDENT OR SO THAT. THEY GENERALLY END UP REFLECTING THE EXISTING ELECTED BODY. I MEAN TO SAT TO MAKE SENSE WHEN I'M SAYING. SHARIA. IT THE WAY THE LAW IS STRUCTURED -- IT IS DESIGNED TO GIVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SOME FLEXIBILITY IN HOW COMMISSIONERS ARE APPOINTED THIS IS IN RECOGNITION OF THE DIVERSITY THAT ALREADY EXISTS WITHIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE FOR EXAMPLE. A SOME COMMUNITIES LIKE HAVING A PANEL OF RETIRED JUDGES DRIVE LINES OTHERS LIKE USING A RANDOM SELECTION PROCESS. BUT IT DOES HAVE IS MULTIPLE PROTECTIONS TRYING TO AVOID ANY AFFECTING THE PROCESS IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THESE ARE NON PARTISAN RACES. SERVER EXAMPLE QUALIFICATIONS ARE EXTREMELY. PAYNE DONORS CAN'T BE ON THE COMMISSION PEOPLE HER PARTY OFFICIALS CAN'T BE ON THE COMMISSION PEOPLE OFTEN CAN THAT'S FOR OFFICE CAN'T BE ON THE COMMISSION. SO THERE'S A COLD CASE MOMENTS TRAIN SCREEN THAT OUT IT HAS TO BE AN OPEN AYE APPLICATION PROCESS. AND FINALLY NO DIRECT APPOINTMENT TO THE COMMISSION HAS PROVIDED SO. IS ALLOWED SO WHATEVER METHOD IS ULTIMATELY SELECTED TO APPOINT COMMISSIONERS THE HOPE IS THAT THROUGH ALL THESE PROTECTIONS WE PUT AND YOU'RE TRULY CAN HAVE PEOPLE WERE. PRETTY NONPARTISAN NOT COMING IN WITH AN AXE TO GRIND FOR TRYING TO BEST REPRESENT COMMUNITIES LETTER. AND IT SOUNDS BETTER I MEAN THEN WHAT. EXISTS NOW IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT I MEAN THAT'S WHEN -- ALSO IT MIGHT HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE VOTER RIGHT AT VOTER RIGHTS ACT LAWSUITS. WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW IN THE PAST BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT SOMEONE SO WILL DO YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. BASED ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO DREW THE LINES IN THE ON THE COULD GO BACK TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO HAVING THOSE PROTECTIONS IS HELPFUL. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WERE LOOKING FOR A SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION IN A SECOND AND TO WITH THE AUTHOR LIKE CLOSER MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS I KNOW COMMON CAUSES IS INCREDIBLY COMMITTED TO GOOD GOVERNMENT BIPARTISAN NONPARTISAN SOLUTIONS I'M IS PART OF WHY I'M PROUD THAT THIS MEASURE HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTES INFECTED WITH.

ABOUT A MADAM CHAIR SP I THE TWENTY AIDS ARE IS ARE A BILL THE REFORMS ARE THE RESULT HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT ARENA WHICH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. ARE KNOWN OR KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEONE OR BLOOM ALSO HAS A READER REFORM BILL -- WE ARE -- IN CONVERSATION THAT THE BILL'S. HOW PERFECTLY I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL LIVE IN THE AND SO LOOK FOR THOSE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS? ARE AS A READ OF COURSE ISN'T IMPORTANT TOOL OUGHT TO GUIDE OUR COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE HOUSING GOALS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS MARKETRATE. MODERATE -- LOW INCOME VERY LOW INCOME -- AND TO INFORM HOUSING ELEMENT DECISIONS AND SO FORTH AUDRINA HAS TAKEN ON ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANCE WITH THE PASSAGE. OF SB THIRTY FIVE BECAUSE IT NOW PLAYS INTO WHETHER COMMUNITY ARE BECOME STREAMLINED SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT -- ARENA -- AS WE WENT THROUGH THE S. B. THIRTY FIVE PROCESS LAST YEAR I THINK THE ONE THING THAT. PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE AGREED ON WHATEVER SIDE THEY WERE ON IS ARENA NEEDED SOME HELP ODD THAT THERE IT WAS A VERY ODD INEQUITABLE PROCESS. ARE WE SEE -- A LOT OF TIMES WEALTHIER I'M COMMUNITIES -- POPULATION WISE GEOGRAPHICALLY HAVING WHILE WILDLY DISPARATE -- READ ALLOCATIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES. AS OUGHT REDONDO BEACH -- WITH -- FOURTEEN HUNDRED REALLOCATION OVER A YEAR'S A FOURTEEN HUNDRED UNITS ITS NEIGHBORS HERMOSA AYE MANHATTAN BEACHES -- WITH ALLOCATIONS RESPECTIVELY OF TWO AND THIRTY SEVEN SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME EXTREME DISPARITIES YOU MAY HAVE SEEN I'M NOT PICKING ON YOUR DISTRICT SOMEONE NUMBER BUT BEVERLY HILLS. RECEIVE THE REALLOCATION OF TWO UNITS OVER AN EIGHT YEAR YEAH. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE THIS IS THE AND HAPPENS IN THE BAY AREA AS WELL WITH SOME REALLY -- EXTREME -- EXTREMELY TO BIRDS AND SO ON IT IS NOT IT IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY THROUGHOUT -- THE STATE. I AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING GUARD RAILS AROUND THE RING A PROCESS A RIGHT NOW. ARE THE STATE BASICALLY ALLOCATES LARGE QUANTITIES OF HOUSING -- ON NUMBERS TO THE REGIONS TO THE COGS AND THEN THE COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT THAN GO THROUGH BASICALLY A POLITICAL FOOD FIGHT. TO DIVVY THAT UP AMONG THE CITIES WITHIN THE READS AND I'M WE'RE TRYING TO PUT MORE GUARD US TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SOUGHT ALLOCATION. IS DONE IN A MORE METHODICAL SO S. B. TWENTY EIGHT I GIVE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE OUGHT TO EACH CD ON HOW TO CALCULATE THE BACKLOG OF EXISTING HOUSING NEED BY READS AND BY IN A CRATE INTEGRATING DATA ABOUT A VACANCY RATE OVERCROWDING HOUSING COST BURDEN SO WE'RE TRYING TO DIG. OUT OF THE PAST HOLE WE CREATED. UNDER IT ARE CURRENTLY AND WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS REQUIRES -- THAT COMMUNITIES ON FOR A 125%. OUT OF THEIR ALLOCATION -- AND IT -- REQUIRES ACCOUNTS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO FOCUS ON CONCENTRATING GROWTH AND HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS WITH GOOD PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. BOSSES BILL I THINK IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD OTHER COMMITTEES ARE SUGGESTED TO OUR AMENDMENTS I ONCE ADDRESSED BOTH OF THEM AND AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTING BOTH OF THEM -- ONE VERY RELUCTANTLY AND OCHSNER Y. BY WANNA ON WHICH WE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND I KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THESE ISSUES. OUGHT TO ONE OF THEM BY REMOVES AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS PLACED INTO THE BILL BY THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION HOUSING COMMITTEE. I AM AGNOSTIC ABOUT WHETHER IT STAYS AND WRITTEN STAND I JUST DON'T WANNA GET CAUGHT IN A VICE BETWEEN TWO COMMITTEES. SO WILL AGREE TO THE AMENDMENT BUT WE WAS ASKED IF THE TWO COMMITTEES COULD COMMUNICATE AND WILL HOST TO WHAT WE'RE TOLD TO DO AND APPROPRIATIONS EVEN TO KEEP IT OUT OR PUT IT BACK IN. STILL WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE -- GOING TO BE ACCUSED OF ADULTERY -- AND THEN THE SECOND ARE THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED AGREE I REDUCING THE RENA ZONING ALLOCATION FROM A 125% 2100%. ON ALTHOUGH -- THIS ISSUE IS NOT AT THE HEART OF THE BILL RIGHT BEFORE IT'S MAKING SURE WE I'M. MORE GUARDRAILS AROUND HOW THOSE SUB ALLOCATIONS HAPPEN ON I DO JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT THE REASON WHY WE INCREASE AT ABOUT A 100%. IS TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES ARE ACTUALLY HITTING A 100% BECAUSE WHEN COMMUNITY ZONE FOR EXACTLY A 100%. THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE REASONS WHY PRIDE. SOME PROJECTS DON'T HAVE BEEN EARLY AT THE LATE WHERE THEY'RE BUILT ON THE ZONING AND THEN IT MAKES IT ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO COMMUNITIES. WILL HIT A 100%. WE BELIEVE A 125% WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKELY TO COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE A 100%. OUGHT IN ADDITION ARE KEEPING IT A 100% I WILL MEAN THERE ARE FEWER PARCELS AVAILABLE FOR MULTI UNIT WHICH MEANS IT'S HARDER FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS THAT'S EXACTLY THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THAT IN THERE WASN'T. AN ARBITRARY LET'S STICK IT TO THE CITIES ARE THERE WITH A A REAL POLICY BASIS FOR DOING THAT ARE BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE US TO GO TO A HUNDRED OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE COMMITTEE IN DEFERENCE WERE. WILL ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT SO WITH THAT SAID I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I WITH ME TODAY ARE AS OUR CORNELIUS BURKE FROM THE BAY AREA COUNCIL ONE OF OUR SPONSORS THE MICHAEL LANE FROM THE NONPROFITHOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU WELCOME SETTLEMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL.

ARE THIS BILL GETS HAS ACCURATE MET DATA. ACRID METHODOLOGY TO REALLY GET. AND ADEQUATE PLANNING OF WITH THAT WE PRESENT FEE OUT FROM AYE THOUGH. THANK YOU WALTER AYE AYE CURRY AND MEMBERS MICHAEL AIM AT THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE REIGN OF REFORM AND MODERNIZATION. S. B.. EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT THE SCARCITY OF PROPERTIES ON MULTI FAMILY SIZE THEIR COMPETITIVE PER STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE PROGRAMS IS A REAL PROBLEM. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT ADDRESSES BY REQUIRING A JURISDICTIONS OWN FOR MORE SUCH SITES. THIS REPORTEDLY SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON SKYROCKETING LAND PRICES AND SH ASSURE SUFFICIENT PARCELS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT FOR PLACES LIKE THE BAY AREA WERE LACKING GO FOR MORE THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS AN ACRE UP FOR MORE. IT TAKES THREE INGREDIENTS TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING LAND FUNDING AND POLITICAL WILL TO GET PROJECTS APPROVED. IF WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS WE NEED THESE THREE INGREDIENTS. THE METHODOLOGY CALLED FOR AN SP TWENTY EIGHT TO ASSESS THE TRUE HOUSING NEED WILL PROVIDE BOTH GREATER ACCURACY. AND EQUITY IN THOSE RANDOM NUMBERS. AND JUST SUSPECT THIS 125% ARENA WERE REALLY PROTECT PERPLEXED BY THE THE ANGST OVER THIS IS ACTUALLY A BEST PRACTICE SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE YOU DO IT. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT THE STATE LEVEL FOR THE FOR THE REASONS ASIDE BUT MY CENTER WINNER AND WE REALLY SUPPORT THE BILL AS IT CURRENTLY. EXISTS BUT WILL. WE'LL GO ALONG WITH THE WILL OF THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE BUT I JUST NEED TO MAKE THAT POINT. WE NEED LAND BUILDABLE LAND MULTI FAMILY LAND 125% IS NOT AN EXCESSIVE ASK A AT ALL WE WISH THAT WOULD WOULD STAY IN THE BILL. AND WE REQUEST DRIVER. OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR CITIES ARE COUNTIES WHO DON'T WANT US EVER TELLING THEM. WHAT TO DO -- BUT I I REALLY THINK -- AND TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE I THINK WE HAVE TO SOMETIMES AS POLICY MAKERS STEP AWAY FROM THE ACRONYMS AND FIGHTS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. AND TALK ABOUT ON THAT AT THE ACTUAL HUMAN ASPECT OF THIS. AND WE HAVE A SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOMES -- DOT SHORTAGE IS EQUAL TO THE SHORTAGE OF THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES COMBINED A SAY THAT AGAIN. OUR DEFICIT OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS EQUAL TO THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES COMBINED. UP WE HAVE A HUGE AND GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION AND IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL THAT IS ONE COMPONENT. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING -- WHO ARE BRINGING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING AND YOU ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS OR IN SHELTERS OR OTHER PLACES WHERE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIVING? IS ASTOUNDING IN SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALONE WE'VE [inaudible] TWENTY TWO HUNDRED HOMELESS CHILDREN. WE HAVE CHILLED KIDS WHO GO AWAY TO COLLEGE WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO RETURN BACK TO THE TOWN THEY GREW UP IN ITS IMPOSSIBLE MUSTER IN A LIVE. IN THEIR PARENTS BASEMENT WE HAVE YOUNG FAMILIES WHO ARE NOT WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT TO HAVE THAT SECOND KID AND THEY'RE GONE. OFTEN LEAVING CALIFORNIA TIGHTLY IT IS DEBILITATING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE GOALS AS PEOPLE ARE PUSHING THE TWO HOUR COMMUTES. IT IS UNDERMINING OUR CONDO ME AS EMPLOYERS SAY I'M GONNA EXPAND ELSEWHERE BECAUSE MY WORKERS CAN'T FIND A PLACE TO LIVE HERE. THESE ARE REAL ISSUES WITH ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL. AND HUMAN IMPACTSAND WE KNOW THAT WHEN THERE IS DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON HOUSING. ARE IT IS OUR LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS -- WHO ARE ALWAYS THE ONES WHO WERE HURT I'VE BEEN MOST I AM GREATEST RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS AND JUST BEING PUSH ON TIGHTLY? ARE SO WE CAN HAVE ALL THE DEBATES -- WITH ALL OF OUR FRIENDS HERE ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL US WHAT -- TO TO WE DON'T YOU KNOW WE WERE GOING TO QUIBBLE WITH THIS SO THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ACRONYMS. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE -- AND I JUST I AND I I'M AND I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO KEEP OUR I ON THAT BALL BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

WE ARE TRYING TO RETHINK IN EVERY CONTEXT OF THIS ISSUE OF WATER HOW. WE DELIVER CLEAN WATER IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY A ACROSS THE BOARD SO WE'RE DOING. A STORM WATER CAPTURE AND RECYCLING AND WE JUST DID IT WITH THE SUMMER FRIEDMAN A BIG BILL DEALING WITH WATER EFFICIENCY. BUT ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS CEREMONIES IN WORKING ON THIS STUFF IS WE'VE GOT A LOT COMMUNITIES. THROUGH VARIOUS SOME OF THE REASONS I JUST DON'T GET ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER PRICKLY RURAL AREAS IT'S A BIG PROBLEM. WE'VE THREE HUNDRED WATER DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE OF WATER THAT'S WORST IN FLINT MICHIGAN. IF IT IS RIDICULOUS RIGHT AND AND AND SO WE TRY TO CORRECT ONE OF THOSE PROCESS DIFFUSE AGO WITH SENATOR WALK AND SENATOR LENO.

ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAD JUST CA.GOV AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES HERE TODAY. OF RELUCTANTLY HERE -- TO EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS IT WAS AMENDED -- LAST FRIDAY SO -- WITH THE AMENDMENTS LAST FRIDAY WE'RE STILL SORTING THROUGH -- YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO IMPACT OUR WASTE WATER AGENCIES BUT THERE. ARE A FEW SPECIFIC COMPONENTS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR US THOUGH. A ONE OF THOSE BEING THE NEW LANGUAGE ON PAGE SIX THAT ALLOWS -- REGIONAL BOARD TO ORDER AN EXTENT. WITH ACCESS CAPACITY AND THEN GIVES THE STATE BOARD THE RIGHTS TO THAT EXCESS CAPACITY FOR FIVE YEARS WITHOUT PAYING THE CONNECTION FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY -- ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT A LOCAL AGENCIES DO DUE PROCESS RIGHTS GIVEN THE NEW AMENDMENTS I WON'T GET INTO THE DETAILS THERE -- BUT THERE AT SEVERAL SPECIFIC THINGS THEY'VE BEEN OUTLINED BY SOME OF OUR A MEMBER AGENCIES THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT -- WE DO KNOW THAT THE POLICY HANDBOOK OUTLINED IN THE BILL SHOULD BE CLARIFIED AS TO WHETHER IT'S A BINDING REGULATORY DOCUMENT OR IF IT'S A FLEXIBLE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT -- AND THEN WE HAVE SOME PRACTICAL CONCERNS WITH JUST HOW THIS PROCESS WOULD WORK ON THE GROUND SO. AND IT'S IT'S UNCLEAR WHO WOULD DETERMINE THE COSTS OF INTERCONNECTION -- WHETHER THE FEES ARE REASONABLE -- IMPORTANTLY WHAT FORM THE REGIONAL BOARDS ORDER WOULD TAKE SO IS IT AND ENFORCEMENT ORDER AGAINST THE LOCAL AGENCY AND WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE SINCE THE LOCAL AGENCY HADN'T. HAD A WATER QUALITY VIOLATION -- IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THESE ACTIONS WOULD WORK WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH MULTIPLE LOCAL AGENCIES SO IN SOME CASES THE CITY MIGHT OWN AND OPERATE A COLLECTION SYSTEM THAT'S THE CLOSEST. ADJACENT SYSTEM TO THIS DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S ALSO THAT SECONDARY LAYER OF A CONTROL AGENCY WHICH IS A DOWNSTREAM AGENCY THAT WOULD BE MAKING DETERMINATIONS. ABOUT TREATMENT CAPACITY CONNECTION FEES THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO -- UNDER THE PROVISION. AMENDED ON FRIDAY I'M IT'S CLEAR WHETHER THAT ORDER WOULD -- APPLY TO BOTH OF THESE ENTITIES. IT'S ADDRESS SO I'M WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE SOME STRONGER LANGUAGE ON THE SERVICE EXTENSIONS BEING COMPLIANT WITH PROP TWO EIGHTEEN THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE SENDER STUFF ABOUT. FURTHER UP IN SEVERAL MONTHS -- WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT ADEQUATE FINANCING FOR THE FOR EVERY SINGLE AND EXTENSION OF SERVICE. BE SECURED PRIOR TO THE EXTENSION BEING ORDERED AND THEN WE'D LIKE TO SEEK SOME FURTHER CLARITY ON THE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES THAT THE BILL'S TARGETING SO. AND I JUST WANNA FINALLY NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT OBJECTING IN ANY WAY -- TO FINDING SOLUTIONS FOR THESE COMMUNITIES WITH FEELING SEPTIC SYSTEMS. WE CERTAINLY EMPATHIZE WITH THE SITUATIONS AND OUR MEMBERS ARE IN EXISTENCE TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROVIDE SEWER SERVICE. TO COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THAT SO AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPOSED PROGRAM REFLECTS THE REASONABLE. AND WORKABLE PROCESS AND WE UNFORTUNATELY DON'T FEEL THAT THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY GETS THERE FOR US SO MUCH THAT WE JUST APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR COMMENTS THEN -- WERE OPEN TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION WITH CENTER HERTZBERG GONNA STOP AT THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARIAN WARMER DOWN THE ROAD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. A WE DO NOT HAVE AN OPPOSED POSITION JUST TO CLARIFY BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS SIMILAR TO MY COLLEAGUE AND WE HAVE SOME PROCESS CONCERNS BUT LET ME TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE NOT MENTIONED. BOMB ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY DEFINITION OF INCLUDED IN THE BILL IT CAPTURES MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES. THAT THERE ARE IN OUR MEMBER COUNTIES THAT. GET CONSIDERATIONS SO I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT. WE ALSO APPRECIATE -- THE INTERESTS OF THE SENATOR HOUSING ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS ARE THESE CONCERNS THESE ARE NOT NEW ISSUES AS WAS ACKNOWLEDGED EARLIER THIS IS THE IF YOU WILL THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE ISSUE THAT SENATOR MONNING IS TRYING TO ADDRESS IN HIS MEASURE. A WE HAVE THE SAME SORT OF SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AS IT WERE. FROM OUR EXPERIENCE FIND IN THE CAPITAL TO PUT IN THE FACILITIES TO ADDRESS IN THIS CASE A NEED FOR A SOURCE SYSTEM. IS NOT THE ISSUE WHERE WE START GETTING SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE COMMUNITIES IS THE O. THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS THAT GO ALONG WITH SUPPORTING THESE FACILITIES. IN MANY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES DO NOT HAVE THE ECONOMIC WHEREWITHAL. TO SUPPORT THE FACILITY AND GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS FROM PROP TWO EIGHTEEN A AND OTHER SIMILAR. REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS WE'RE IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN TERMS OF BRINGING THESE FACILITIES TO LIFE. SO WE WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S A PROBLEM. WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE IF THERE WERE A MARKET BASED APPROACH TO THESE SITUATIONS WE'D OF HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO IDENTIFY THEM AND BRING THEM TO LIFE BUT THAT'S NOT BEEN THE CASE. I'M I WOULD ALSO. OF ONE LAST COMMENT. IS THAT THE THE CURRENT PROCESS THAT'S BEEN ARTICULATED BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLICITY. OF ENTITIES THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED BETWEEN A RURAL COUNTY WHERE YOU HAVE. EVERYTHING FROM A SMALL CITY TO A CS A COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT TO UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH FOR WORD. TO BRING ALL THESE DISPARATE ENTITIES INTO THE PROCESS BUT WE BELIEVE IT NEEDS ON A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL THOUGHT AND WORK IN TERMS OF GETTING US THERE -- AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE ENTRY PRODUCTIVE. A PARTICIPANT IN THE CONVERSATION WE JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL IS QUITE THERE YET THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK. I AM SURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAMELA MILLER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LAUGH BECAUSE I TO WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE BILL. ARE WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL. I IN FACT WE AGREE WHOLE HEARTEDLY WITH THE CONCEPT THERE'S NO REASON IS WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE DRINKING WATER ISSUE. THERE'S NO REASON THAT ANYONE IN CALIFORNIA. SHOULD BE LIVING WITH THESE ISSUES -- AND SO WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON OF THIS BIG ISSUE. WE ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF OF FOR WORKING WITH US OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS THEY HAVE WORKED WITH US -- ANNA IN ADDRESSING A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THEIR EFFORTS. AND THERE'S STILL A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE THOUGH AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THERE MAY BE A FEW POINTS THAT NEED. TO BE WORKED OUT JUST A LITTLE MORE. AT IN TERMS OF THE ANNEXATION OF ISSUE AFTER THE EXTENSION OF SERVICE THERE'S STILL SOME OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT -- MANDATING AN ANNEXATION -- DEPENDING UPON WHETHER IT'S A A SPECIAL DISTRICT THAT IS -- DOING THE EXTENSION OF SERVICE OR A MUNICIPALITY. AYE AND SO ON THE OPPOSED UP COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON A I AM LIKE A BIT LITTLE BIT CLARIFICATION ON THAT THEY CONCERN US IF THAT ACTUALLY REMOVES THAT -- ANNEXATION A MANDATE WITH RESPECT TO THE DISTRICTS. AND THEN IN ADDITION THE NEW AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN A RAISE A QUESTION ABOUT. FOR US JUST HOW FAR THE EXTENSION MAY OCCUR AND WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN IN TERMS OF OUR GROWTH INDUCING SO. AT AND THEN FINALLY IN TERMS OF THE ANNEXATION ONCE THE EXTENSION OF SERVICES ORDERED. TO ENSURE THAT THAT ANNEXATION PROCESS GOES THROUGH THE LAUGH CHO THAT IT IS. A ONCE THE WATER BOARD MANDATES THE EXTENSION OF SERVICE. THEN -- THEREBY MANDATING THE ANNEXATION THAT THAT PROCESS GO THROUGH LAUGH CHO. SO WITH THAT OUT APPRECIATE AGAIN ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS AND YOUR STAFF AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION AND WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE VERY ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. SING NONE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS FROM MANY YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU OF SENATOR I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON I'M WORKING ON THIS ISSUE -- ALONG WITH SENATOR MINDING YOUR COLLEAGUE -- LOUIS ARE WORKING REALLY HARD TO CLEAN UP THE WATER IN CALIFORNIA BOTH THE WATER THAT -- THAT THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH AND IN THIS BILL IN THE DRINKING WATER. ISSUE WE'VE TRIED TO WORK ON IT THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET OF THE GOVERNOR -- WAS AMENABLE TO THAT AND IT JUST -- IT'S ONE OF THE MORE COMPLICATED ISSUES OUT LITERALLY SO I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IT YET BUT WE WILL GET IT DONE -- THERE'S TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS STILL SITTING OUT THERE AND WE'RE NOT DONE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. SO A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE FOR THIS YEAR BUT WE'LL SEE WHERE THAT LEADS US -- I'D OF I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION BECAUSE I'M JUST NOT QUITE CLEAR HOW HOW WAS I THINGS WILL WORK UNDER YOUR BILL. ON AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD ON ISSUES IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS WHERE -- PEOPLE BEEN ASKED TO INSTALL SEPTIC SYSTEMS AND I AND THE COSTA BEEN EXORBITANT AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE LIVED IN THE MOUNTAINS FOREVER AND THEY CAN'T BEAR THOSE COSTS. THEY CAUSED AN UPROAR A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- SO MY QUESTION IS -- STEP IN CALABASAS NO YEAR YOU KNOW TRIED NOT TO YOU KNOW WANTED A IDENTIFY PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES. SANTA MONICA MOUNDS WASN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU [inaudible] GAINES. YEAH SO I THOUGHT WHAT I JUST WANT TO KNOW -- HOW THE ECONOMICS ARE GOING TO WORK HERE WHAT'S THE ENTITLED AND WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK THIS IS REALLY ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW THE? TEN MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE NEXT TO THE FORTY MILLION DOLLAR HOUSES THE SLAPPER BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE PROPERTY AND ECONOMIC AMOUNTS MIGHT BE WORTH A HAPPIER PERSON LOSE THEIR THE PEOPLE. THAT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT AT YEAH WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW THEY MOVE EARLIER BOUGHT IT WHEN I GOT WORTH THAT'S RIGHT I GOT TO COMPLETELY GET THAT I'M STILL AROUND. I JUST ALSO WANT TO SAY TO YOU IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IN THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMITTEES AS DEFINED ON HOW TO GET THE MONEY TO FIX THE PROBLEM RIGHT IT'S A BIG ISSUE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA JUST WRITE A CHECK. UP RIGHT IT'S THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BOND ISSUE JACKET BILL THE RAISE FEES SO WITH THIS CREATIVE APPROACH THAT SENATOR WHAT DID AND SENATOR -- GROUP -- LENO DID YEARS AGO THE BUDGET PLATE. THERE'S OVER A THOUSAND WATER DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THROUGH CONSOLIDATION OF SOME OF THOSE WATER DISTRICTS YOU ACTUALLY GET EFFICIENCIES THAT RESULT IN. BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE CLEAN WATER PEOPLE IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE THE RICHER WATER BOARDS SINCE WE PUT OUT S. B. TWELVE OR FIFTEEN OUR ARMED IN THIS HOLE IN A POSITION PROCESS I BELIEVE THE NUMBERS WERE YEAH. THE BOARD HAS ISSUED TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY INFORMAL CONSOLIDATIONS LETTERS INDICATING STATE WATER BOARD TO TED TO INITIATE CONSOLIDATION WHICH HAVE LED. TO MORE THAN FORTY VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATIONS NO JUST GOVERNMENT THINK YOU'LL BUT DIFFERENT MORE CREATIVELY THEN HELPS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THAT CONCEPT AND SIEU BEGIN APPLIED TO WASTE WATER IN ADDITION. TO THE CLEAN WATER SIDE BECAUSE THE ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES IT IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED THAT SCOPE AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW I MEAN WHAT WHAT THE STATE WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD PUT IN WHICH I DON'T THINK WAS ACTIVELY REPRESENTED IN THE IN THE OPPOSITION IT'S AS IF THE CAPACITY BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED FOR CALLING CONSOLIDATION. IS PROVIDED THAT THE WORDS YOU GOT TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN TROUBLE YOU CONSOLIDATE. AND YOU GET EXTRA WATER THE STATE ONE SIX TWO WATER PRESUMABLY TO HELP OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN NEED VERSES WHATEVER RIGHT THAT'S THE CONCEPT IN THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE TWO EIGHTEEN IDEA FEES. WHOLE CONCEPT BEHIND THIS IS NOT TO CHARGE PEOPLE MONEY BUT TO TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND CREATIVE AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE REASON WE CHOSE TO EXTEND THIS TO WASTE WATERS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO FAR LITERALLY JUST. ASKING NEIGHBORS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WOULD AFFECT THE ISSUE IN SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS. CONSERVANCY I I DON'T KNOW ON AYE AYE MY SENSE IS THAT IT DOES LET ME LET ME ARE THERE I WASN'T I DON'T KNOW I WAS USING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THERE -- HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS NOT -- SUGGESTING THAT IT NECESSARILY IS GOING TO HAVE ANY IMPACT THERE AT ALL.
