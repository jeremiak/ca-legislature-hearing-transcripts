MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHERS ACROSS THE WORLD A YEAR AGO I WAS RAPIDLY WORKING TO TRANSITION AND NEARLY 1100% OF THE DEPARTMENT WORKFORCE. THE NEARLY 1100% HELLO WORKFORCE AT AN UNIMAGINABLE PACE. AS I QUICKLY WORKED TO ASSIMILATE INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS I WAS WORKING TO FURTHER TRANSITION. OUR OPERATIONS TO A SUSTAINABLE MINIMAL IN PERSON OPERATION WELL AT THE SAME TIME LEADING A KEY ORGANIZATION PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS. ON LEAVE OPTIONS WORKERS COMPENSATION AND WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS. THEY ARE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE ENSURING WORKERS KNOW THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW THAT WE TAKE APPROPRIATE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AS WELL. AND SERVING IN IT YOU TO COULD TORIA ROLL FOR INJURED WORKERS AND THOSE WORKERS WHO HAVE FACED RETALIATION OR WAIT STAFF. I WISH TO LEAVE DIR IN ITS EFFORTS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS AND TO ENSURE EMPLOYERS HAVE THE GUIDANCE SPACEY. ARE TAKING STEPS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETYOF THEIR WORKFORCE ARE INSURED DURING WORKERS ARE FREE FROM RETALIATION AND RECEIVE ENTITLED WAGES AND BENEFITS. I WANT TO LEAVE THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER ROLE THAT ALLOWS ME TO DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK BUT I HAVE SPENT MY CAREER ADDRESSING. ENSURING WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS ARE UPHELD WHILE BALANCING WORKER AND EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE. MY TWENTY PLUS YEARS OF STATE LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE HAS PREPARED ME TO LEAD DIR DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. I PLAN TO DO THIS BY BALANCINGOUR INTERNAL WORKFORCE NEEDS WITH THAT OF THE WORK FORCE AND EMPLOYERS WE SERVE AND CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING UPON BOTH. SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT BALANCE INCLUDE ENSURING CALLOSUM CAN INVESTIGATE AND ENSURE WORKPLACE STANDARDS. FIRST WE MUST ENSURE OUR STANDARDS ARE THE RIGHT ONES. LISTEN TO OUR EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS FEEDBACK WHILE APPLYING APPROPRIATE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH STANDARDS. WE MUST COMMUNICATE AND TRAIN EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS ON THE RESULT IN STANDARD WE MUST ENSURE THAT HELLO CHAU WORKFORCE IS ADEQUATELY STAFFED AND PROTECTED AND HAS THE TOOLS IT NEEDS TO ENFORCE STANDARDS. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS CAN INVESTIGATE RETALIATION AND WAGE CLAIMS. CLAIMANTS CAN COLLECT THEIR JUDGMENTS AND OUR CLAIMS PROCESS IS ACCESSIBLE AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATED TO THOSE MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS. IT TOO MUST BE ADEQUATELY STAFFED TRAINED AND STAFF NEED APPROPRIATE TOOLS. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CAN ADJUDICATE WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS WITH APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY ENSURE NO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS THE INJURED WORKERS BENEFIT. ALL OF THESE MISSION FOCUSED ACTIVITIES ARE UNDERWAY AND IN VARIOUS STAGES AND OUR CORE GRADED WITHIN D. I. **** STRATEGIC PLAN WHICH WILL SERVE AS OUR ROAD MAP OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. I WISH TO CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BY THINKING THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF DIR WITH RECENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS TO SUPPORT MANY OF THE REFERENCED BOWLS. I ALSO WISH TO THANK THE INCREDIBLE TEAM MEMBERS OF DIR WHO WORK TIRELESSLY TO PROTECT WORKERS EVERY DAY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THEIR UNFLAGGING COMMITMENTS BASS XPERTISE AND PROFESSIONALISM INSPIRES ME EVERY DAY. I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR LET ME- TURN AND START WITH SENATOR LATER TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MAN PRO TEM. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MEET UP- MS HAGEN AND- HELLO MORE DISCUSSION AND SHEET METAL MY QUESTIONS AND SHE HAS NO OPPOSITION I FEEL NO NEED TO PUT ANY OF THE QUESTIONS ON THE RECORD AND I'M GOING TO BE VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED ARE SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OR MADAM PRETEND IT WAS DEFINITELY MY PLEASURE SPEND SOMETIME WITH YOU THIS MORNING DIRECTOR I REALLY APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND- BEFORE I GO TO THOSE I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR FOLLOWING UP OR SENDING ME AN EMAIL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW UP WITH MY RETROACTIVITY QUESTION REGARDING. AN PROPOSITION TWENTY TWO EIGHTY FIVE AND WHOSE INCLUDED HIS EXCLUDED AND THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD ON IT THE RETROACTIVITY. I DO WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME BECAUSE OF THAT CONVERSATION TO GET INTO SOME WORKERS COMP ISSUES- WE GOT INTO A COUPLE BIT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD ON WORKERS COMP IS THAT I'M GLAD THAT OSHA'S STEPPED UP AND MADE SURE THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC OR EMPLOYEES- ARE SAFE. BUT THEY DID FELL TO HOLD ADVISORY MEETINGS BEFORE ISSUING THE COBRA TEMPORARY STANDARD AND I WAS THEM I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVING MEETINGS NOW YOU SAID THAT THE LAST MEETING WAS TODAY YOU'VE HAD CONSISTENT MEETINGS- OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. A FEW WEEKS AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU'LL- TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE BUSINESS CAN A COMMUNITY NEEDS I WAS OUT WONDERING IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERING KEEPING THE RAKES TEMPORARY SINCE WE HAVE EVER CHANGING DYNAMAT DYNAMICS LIKE VACCINES CHANGES TO THE IMPACT THE SPREAD- THE DO YOU ANTICIPATE. THESE REGULATIONS BECOMING PERMANENT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- IT IS V. WE DID HAVE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS- AFTER THE EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STANDARD- WAS PUT IN PLACE AND IN FACT THEY STARTED LAST WEEK AND ARE CONTINUING- THIS WEEK. AND UP AT TODAY THEY CONCLUDE- IT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT- THAT CADENCE OR THAT PROCESS IS FAIRLY TYPICAL OF THE RULE MAKING PROCESS. WE DID HAVE- A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR AT FEEDBACK- AT THE- OVERSHADOWED THE STANDARDS BOARD MEETINGS- IN THE FALL- AND I ATTENDED THOSE MEETINGS AS A MEMBER AT COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHILE LISTENING TO ALL THE EMPLOYER AND LABOR FEEDBACK. AND WE TOOK AT ALL OF THOSE COMMENTS HELLO SHE TOOK ALL OF THOSE COMMENTS BACK- AND MADE SURE THAT- WE DID OUR BEST TO REFLECT. THE FEEDBACK- AND BALANCE THE NEEDS TO PROTECT. OUR WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA WITH YOU KNOW THAT THE EMPLOYERS- NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT AND IT YOU KNOW THE VISION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS- SO WE DID HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FEEDBACK- THE WE COMMENDED WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STANDARD THAT WE WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS BEFORE WE- RENDERED THE PERMANENT- STANDARD. AND SO AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S OCCURRING NOW- SO TO YOUR QUESTION IT'S- WE DO INTEND TO ISSUE PERMANENT STANDARDS BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE. THAT THINGS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING- WITHIN YOU KNOW DIFFERENT CDC GUIDANCE COMING OUT- YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL RESEARCH BEING DONE- AND IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT. GOING FORWARD WE MAY MODIFY- THAT THE REGULATION- OR MAKE SOME SORT OF- CHANGE TO THEM GOING FORWARD. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THAT- MY LAST QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS M. S. B. EIGHT SIXTY THREE WHICH I WAS ABLE TO TAKE PART OF BROUGHT RELIEF TO EMPLOYERS. AND GAIN GREATER BENEFITS TO WORKERS UNDER THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM AND I WOULD HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE REGULATIONS INTHAT WAY- SO THAT WE DON'T INCREASE COSTS TO THE SYSTEM. SOME EXAMPLES ARE LIKE YOU AND ME REPORTS COPY SERVICES AND- THE SUBSEQUENT BENEFIT INTRIGUED AND- THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THEY REALLY- THEY'VE- THEY'VE- THEY SHOULD BE COMING DOWN. BASED ON THAT THE PARAMETERS ARE SET WITH SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE WE'RE I'M HOPING TAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE THOSE COSTS. TO EMPLOYERS SO THAT GREATER BENEFITS GO TO OUR EMPLOYEES. YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND AN ABSOLUTELY- ONE OF THE- MAJOR GOALS THAT WE HAVE OUTLINED IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO REALLY FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES I THINK THAT IS OUR- BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COSTUMES GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME- WE ARE ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT- THE SIP T. F. B. U. ETF PROGRAMS TO SEE IF THERE ARE. WAYS WE CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ODD THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS- TO SORT OF STREAMLINED SOME OF THOSE CLAIMS- AND ALSO. LOOKING TO LEVERAGE THE POWER. BE AT COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS CHEESE WICK- TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL STUDY SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR POINT ON THAT COPY FEE SCHEDULES AND THAT- THAT THAT LEGAL MED LEGAL SCHEDULES- IF THERE WERE SOME STUDIES DONE BACK IN FRAME. I'M I'VE LOOKED AT THOSE A NIGHT I WOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO- APPROACH THE COMMISSION ON POSSIBLY. TAKING ANOTHER LOOK LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES- AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SEE IF THERE'S WAYS WE CAN. IMPROVE UPON THOSE SO ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO. FROM ANY NEW IDEAS IN THAT- BROWN- BUT OVERALL WE ARE IN FACT LOOKING AT WAYS TO. CONTINUOUSLY OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE. AS A COST SAVINGS MEASURE. THANK YOU MA'AM AND YOU FOR THE- AGAIN THAT WE HAVE THIS MORE MORE AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE ARE. SENATOR MR MAJORITY LEADER GO HIT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I UNLIKE MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T GET THE TIME AND- IT'D TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU SO I'M SO SORRY THAT I JUST GOT A COUPLE OF QUICK ENQUIRIES. I WANT TO ASK ON THE PUBLIC RECORD. THE FIRST ISSUE IS ON. FROM HOME WORK THAT WE'VE DONE- THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE RURAL STUDIES OF PROGRAM WHICH LOOKED AT AT FARMWORKERS AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THEIR WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES EIGHT YEARS GLORIA ALONG STATUS STATEMENT IN THAT REGARD THERE'S A SENTIMENT THAT IT'S INEFFECTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE THERE'S AN ISSUE ABOUT CAL OSHA'S EMPLOYERS HAVING DENIED MASKS PAID SICK LEAVE AND REFUSED TO ENACT PUBLIC SAFETY GUIDELINES LIKE SOCIAL DISTANCING FOR FARMWORKERS. I JUST WANTED TO JUST GET YOUR SENTIMENT ON THAT BECAUSE THERE'S AN ISSUE CERTAINLY OF TRUST AND KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING IS ABOUT THAT WITH I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A 100% ACCURATE I WASN'T THERE BUT CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE IN THE STUDY IS A PRETTY CREDIBLE AND I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR SENSE OF. YOUR THINKING ABOUT HOW THE FARM WORKERS ARE BEING TREATED AND WHETHER YOU HAVE. ANY PLANS WITH IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I APOLOGIZE IT- I HAD TROUBLE HEARING THE ENTIRE QUESTION BUT I THINK I HAVE A GENERAL SENSE OF. WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OKAY- YOU KNOW. I THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY I COME FROM- LAKE COUNTY- CALIFORNIA RURAL AREA IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND- I WAS VERY MUCH AN AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT DISTRICT AND SO- I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE- ALL OF THE- MANY CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE- WITH AGRICULTURAL AND- ENSURING THAT OUR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ARE- ARE. HEALTHY AND SAFE IN THE WORKPLACE- THAT'S REGARDLESS OF IF THERE'S A PANDEMIC OR NOT- AND- AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THAT REALM IN TERMS OF EDUCATING EMPLOYERS- EDUCATING WORKERS AND REALLY TRYING TO GET AT- HOW TO BEST REACH THEM. RIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF TRUST HI I'M- I. I I'M NOT SURE I WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO SAY IT'S A LACK OF TRUST AND HELLO SHOULD BUT- BUT PROBABLY MORE A LACK OF TRUST IN GOVERNMENT- SERVICE OR- YOU KNOW SORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT. AND. AND IT. ITS ACT YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS. I'D TO FIND NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO REACH THEM AND- YOU KNOW I'M VERY- I'VE BEEN VERY- EXCITED ACTUALLY ABOUT ALL OF THE GREAT IDEAS COMING FROM NOT ONLY FROM THE D. I. R. STAFF FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE HOLLOW SHAFT. DIVISION WORKERS COMP BUT ALSO- OUT WE WORK CLOSELY WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD- OUR LABOR AGENCY OF COURSE- AND ANOTHER A NUMBER OF OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND REALLY WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS- NAG IN PARTICULAR. AROUND HOW HOW DO WE BEST REACH- OUR MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS- AGRICULTURE BEING A VERY- AT HIGH ON THAT LIST PARTICULARLY- DURING THE WILDFIRE SEASON THIS YOU KNOW WHICH- UNFORTUNATELY HAS BECOME. ALL YEAR ALMOST THAT YOUKNOW HOW DO WE PROTECT THEM- I ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY NEED THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY NEED. AND WE HAVE DONE US A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK- IN THIS AREA OUR REGION EDUCATION. BUT WE HAVE MORE PLANNED- ALL DESPITE A COUPLE OF- WHAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY AT CREATIVE APPROACH WE RENTED OUT A MOBILE TRUCK- MOBILE BILLBOARDS- IT BACK IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER IN OUR LABOR COMMISSIONER LILLIAN. BROWN GARCIA ACTUALLY WENT DOWN AND- PARTICIPATED IN SOME OF THE OUTREACH EVENTS IN THE COACHELLA REGION. I'M AND- THE MOBILE BILLBOARDS- WE'RE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH I AND THERE'S SORT OF A CARAVAN OF- FOLKS THAT WENT FROM ONE AGRICULTURAL WORK SITE TO ANOTHER- ALONG WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE ARE PARTNERING WITH. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY KEY IN REACHING- MANY ARE FAR VULNERABLE WORKERS. IS GOING. TO THOSE- COMMUNITY BASED OR INCISIONS THE WHO FOLKS TRUST RIGHT- WORST MAYBE I KNOW- BUT A MAN OF THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE WELL KNOWN AND TRUSTED- AND WHAT WE DID BACK IN BOB- LATE LAST YEAR WAS I'M JUST EDUCATE FARMWORKERS ON THEIR RIGHTS- THIS WAS ON THE HEELS OF- HAVING HAD REPORTS. THAT THEY WERE SUFFERING RETALIATION- INCLUDING- ILLEGAL DISMISSAL FOR REQUESTING PAID SICK LEAVE- AND SO THIS WAS A VERY- TARGETED- OUTREACH ACTIVITY- IN IT WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON SOME OF THE- COMPLAINTS COMING TO US BUT- WE FELT WE REALLY NEEDED TO TAKE- MAKE A GESTURE EIGHT GRAND GESTURE IF YOU WILL- TO LET THEM KNOW THAT- THANK YOU FOR THAT RIGHT. I APPRECIATE I JUST I RAISE THAT BECAUSE A NUMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA SENATE. CARE DEEPLY ABOUT FARMWORKERS IMAGES WE JUST ASK ON THEIR BEHALF I THINK IN ADDITION TO MY OWN- TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DEBT REMAINS A PRIORITY AND THERE'S A SENSITIVITY THERE. JUST A LITTLE BIT IN EARLY NOVEMBER HELLO SHE RECEIVED AS STE AS OF HER NOVEMBER SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE. COLBERT NINETEEN RELATED COMPLAINTS CONDUCTED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ELEVEN COLD RELATED INSPECTIONS AND ISSUED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CITATIONS AT FORTY TWO LOCATIONS. A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CITATIONS ARE SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE COMPLAINTS. IS THERE IS A RATE OF ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT. HE DID M. I. QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH CONFIDENCE IN EMPLOYEES IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THESE INVESTIGATIONS OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU'VE GENERALLY REVIEWED DURING YOUR TEN YEAR- IT AND HAVE A CONFIDENCE THAT THESE THINGS WERE CONDUCTED IT AT THIS LEVEL BECAUSE OF A ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT. RATE OF- COMPLAINT SORTATION SEEMS TO JUST GENERAL STATUS PRETTY LOW. SHE WANTED TO DRAW THE YOUR TEN TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS THAT AND SEE IF YOU HAVE BEEN. IN THAT PROCESS AT ALL. SURE YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND- YES- WE HAVE HAD QUITE A BIT OF NEWS COVERAGE ON- ARE ON THE WAY ON OUR APPROACH- DURING THE PANDEMIC TO. TO INVESTIGATING- PLANS CALL THE OF COURSE BUT- IN ADDITION TO CODE WE HAVE ON GOING ON HEALTH AND SAFETY COMPLAINTS. AND SOME OF THAT SEEKS TO GIVE YOU UP- ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THIS- WE HAD- FOUR OVERALL ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS IN TWENTY TWENTY. WE PROCESSED OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED COOL THE NINETEEN COMPLAINTS- WE CONDUCTED EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ONSITE INSPECTIONS TO ADDRESS OVER NINETEEN HAZARDS. AND ISSUE TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX OCCASIONS WHICH AMOUNTED TO ABOUT TWO POINT THREE MILLION IN PENALTIES- TO THE END OF THE YEAR- WE CONDUCTED MORE THAN THIRTEEN THOUSAND ON SITE COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE AND VISITS WITH BOTH ENFORCEMENT AND CONSULTATION SERVICES- AND DIRECTING EMPLOYERS TO CORRECT HAZARDS IN EDUCATING THEM ON COULD NINETEEN REQUIREMENTS. AND DO YOU HAVE A HAS A PERSONALLY AS THE DIRECTOR DO YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE. THAT THAT THAT LEVEL OF IMPACT THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE FINES AND THE NUMBER OF CITATIONS THAT ARE ISSUED HAS BEEN APPROPRIATELY AGGRESSIVE IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THE EMPLOYEES. COMPLAINTS YES I THINK THAT WE ARE WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE INSPECTION PROCESS AND- WE THE WAY WE GO ABOUT- CONDUCTING OUR INVESTIGATIONS I THINK IS. ONE THAT- ARE REALLY FORCES EMPLOYERS TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION AND THERE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REMEDIATION IT'S NOT WE AREN'T ONE OF. AN ENTITY THAT NECESSARILY WALKS IN AND HANDS SOMEONE A CITATION AND WALKS OUT RIGHT LIKE OUR APPROACH IS TO HELP THE EMPLOYER. BOB GAIN COMPLIANCE AND WE GIVE THEM LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES REMEDIATE THAT. THAT SAID WHAT I LIKE TO HAVE- YOU KNOW. WHAT I LIKE TO HAVE FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF INSPECTORS OUT THERE- OF COURSE YOU KNOW IN A PANDEMIC- WE ALL WORRY ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING OR OR WHAT WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE- INSPECTORS THAT WE HAVE- WE'VE BEEN AUTHORIZED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON FILLING A LARGE NUMBER OF VACANCIES THAT EXIST. AND I THINK ONCE OF THOSE VACANCIES ARE FILLED- WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS THANK THANK YOU TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THAT- THAT WE DO HAVE THAT SUFFICIENT STAFF. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THAT COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVE OUR- DON'T REALLY RISE TO THE LEVEL OF MEETING AN INSPECTION WE FIND THAT EMPLOYERS WANT TO BE COMPLIANCE- FOR THE MOST PART. AND ART THROUGH OUR LETTER INSPECTION THAT WE SENT A LETTER INSPECTION FOR EVERY COMPLAINT THAT THAT WE OPEN- INVESTIGATION AND WE OPEN AND FOR THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THOSE. THEY ADDRESS AND REMEDIATE THE ISSUE THAT- COME TO OUR ATTENTION IT'S THE ONES WHERE WE- ARE MORE EGREGIOUS- WHERE THERE MAY BE AN OUTBREAK WHERE WE- STRATEGICALLY SEND OUR OUR INSPECTORS. I SEE THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MAJORITY LEADER- HE STARTED DOWN A LIST OF QUESTIONS- SO THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL I WOULD JUST ASK IN TERMS OF THOSE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE OBVIOUSLY- IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT YEAR. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO FEEL A NUMBER OF THOSE POSITIONS THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO CATCH UP ON THE. BACKLOG AND COATED. YES YES WE- WE RESULT HAVE A BACKLOG EXISTING BACKLOG BUT WE INTO YOUR QUESTION HAVE WE MADE PROGRESS PROGRESS. WE MOST DEFINITELY HAVE- WE HAVE- HIRED APPROXIMATELY THIRTY I BELIEVE YES FILLED THIRTY- OF OUR ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL I'M AS WELL SEVEN- HE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IN RECENT MONTHS- WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY- FORTY FOUR ENFORCEMENT POSITIONS THAT REMAIN TO BE FILLED. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD OUR REACHED OUT TO OUR SISTER AGENCIES THAT HAVE- AT A SAFETY ENGINEERS THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD WORKED AT CAL OSHA- AND THE LOAN TO THE STAFF BACK TO US- FOR APPEAR AN INTERIM PERIOD OF TIME- TO HELP US YOU KNOW WE SORT OF GET. MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND- THE LEADERSHIP THAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE INSPECTORS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS THEY'VE EXTENDED THEIR TIME TWICE NOW TO CONTINUE. B. THE WORK OUR WHILE WE CONTINUE TO GET STAFFED UP- IN CALLOW SAID I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT ONE THING SINCE- SINCE IF I POINTED OUT IN MY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS A FEW MONTHS AGO- THAT WE HAD- HIRED MORE STAFF IN DIR IN NOT JUST TELEVISION BUT IN DIR- YOU KNOW WE HAD- FANS SIGNIFICANT GAINS- FILE IN THE LAST MONTH. AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO FIVE. MAKE GAINES I MENTIONED PROXIMALLY TWO HUNDRED HIRES IN EIGHT MONTHS IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS SINCE THE- SENDING MY RESPONSES. WE'VE HIRED BY TWO HUNDRED MORE STAFF SO WE ARE STEADILY MAKING PROGRESS I HAVE I WOULD IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING- THAT TIME RIGHT NOW TO BE RECRUITING INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST AND SAFETY ENGINEERS BUT SO FAR WE HAVE FOUND I'M VERY HIGH QUALITY CANDIDATES WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. I'M AND WE ARE MAKING GAINS IN- OUR HIRING PROCESS. I WOULD BECAUSE YOU MAY KNOW WE LOST OUR HIRING AUTHORITY- SOMETIME AGO AND WERE IN THE PARK PROCESS OF REGAINING THAT HIRING IS THIRTY WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL HELP EXPEDITE OUR HIRING PROCESS ITSELF. GOT IT- I WANT OTHER UNRELATED QUESTION BUT- IT BECAUSE. OF COBIT OBVIOUSLY WORK AT AND THIS IS WORK REN'T TO FOR WAGED A LOT. AND TYPICALLY MEN OF THOSE GO TO ONE OF YOUR REGIONAL OFFICES I GUESS I WOULD ASK HAVE YOU NOTICED- FEWER WAGE CLAIMS BECAUSE OF THAT THAT ISSUE OF REGIONAL OFFICES JUST CURIOUS. I'M NO WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY- THE- I'VE TALKED TO OUR LABOR COMMISSIONER ABOUT THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES AND- THEY INDICATE THAT THE NUMBERS ARE ABOUT THE SAME- AS THEY HAVE BEEN. FREED PANDEMIC. WE TO YOUR POINT OF ACCESSIBILITY TO- TO STAFF WE DO- IF FOLKS. I HEARD THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER SCHEME COMES INTO THE OFFICE- WHEN NEEDED TO OUT TO MEET WITH FOLKS.
