JOBS CARP AND THE DISTRICTS HAVE

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.668
SEPARATE RULES AND REGULATIONS

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:50.670

DISTRICTS IN THEIR WORK. THIS

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:57.777
PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE NEEDED

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:59.278
RESOURCES TO INCREASE OUR

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:00.947

AND LOCAL POLICIES ARE

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.120

ANYWHERE BECAUSE I'M SURE WE

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.761
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS SO. THE

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.430
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:20.800
HISTORICALLY TRADITIONALLY. WE

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.101
HAVE THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.069
DEAL WITH STATIONERY'S

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:26.772
POLLUTANTS. IN THE OF. CARBON

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.642
HERE IN SACRAMENTO DEALS WITH

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:34.313
MOBILE OF POLLUTANTS CAN YOU.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.984
TO THE- REQUESTS FOR THE SIX

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.721
ADDITIONAL STEPS. YEAH HI GOOD

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.189
MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.057
ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:48.194
ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO WE DO HAVE

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.129
SOME COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL I

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.365
THINK FIRST OFF OVERALL WE THINK

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.266
THAT ENSURING THE BOARD HAS

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.600
ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO MONITOR

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.569
COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:57.503
THAT ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.138
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.673
POLLUTION PARTICULARLY IN

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.841
HEAVILY POLLUTED COMMUNITIES HAS

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:03.542
MERIT. SO WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:05.778
WITH THE UNDERLYING GOALS THE

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:06.379
CARDS TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.114
THIS PROPOSAL. HOWEVER WE DO

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.282
THINK THE PROPOSAL RAISES SOME

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:10.516
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR THE

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:11.984
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER-

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.152
PARTICULARLY RELATED TO

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.021
PRIORITIZING RESOURCES WHY

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.422
EXISTING RESOURCES ARE

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:17.757
INSUFFICIENT CHEN. AS THE

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.358
TERMINATIONS OR WHO SHOULD BE

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.560
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE EFFORTS WE

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:22.395
HAVE THREE MAIN SETS OF

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:24.397
QUESTIONS THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:25.498
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMMITTEE

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:26.966
ASKING MINISTRATIONS REPORT AT

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.235
AND IN THIS HEARING AND SO THE

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:31.304
FIRST IS. WHY SHOULD THE STATE

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.072
FOCUS OF LIMITED RESOURCES ON

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.507
MONITORING OF OIL AND GAS

00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:35.541
EXTRACTION FACILITIES RATHER

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:37.076
THAN OTHER SOURCES OF POLLUTION

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.345
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MANY HEAVILY

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.513
POLLUTED COMMUNITIES MOBILE

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:42.281
SOURCES SUCH AS DIESEL TRUCKS

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:43.749
AND EQUIPMENT ARE THE PRIMARY

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.818
SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION AND SO.

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.353
WE THINK ONE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.121
BUT AS THE ADMINISTRATION- ONE

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:51.223
KIND OF FOCUS ON OIL AND GAS

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.758
FACILITIES HAS SUCH A HIGH

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:55.027
PRIORITY. THE SECOND- QUESTION

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:56.696
WE THINK IT IS- WIRE ADDITIONAL

00:09:56.762 --> 00:10:00.766
RESOURCES NEEDED- AND- AS AS THE

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.468
BOARD MENTIONED IN ITS- INITIAL

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.003
COMMENTS CAR PARTY HAS SOME

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.571
EXISTING PROGRAMS AND STAFF

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.406
RESOURCES DEDICATED TO SOME

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:09.041
SIMILAR ACTIVITIES SO FOR

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.977
EXAMPLE THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING THE

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:12.611
STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD ERROR-

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:15.748
NEAR PETROLEUM SOURCES- BUT

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:16.849
WHICH SAID THE BOARD MENTIONED

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:19.251
IN ITS COMMENTS AS WELL AS

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:20.686
EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN ACTIVITIES

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:21.954
AND OTHER RESEARCH EFFORTS TO

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.689
BETTER UNDERSTAND EMISSIONS

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.324
FROM. FACILITIES THE LEGISLATURE

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.126
MIGHT WANT TO ASK CARGO EXPLAIN

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:28.961
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:29.562
THOSE EXISTING RESOURCES ARE

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:32.665
INSUFFICIENT- TO MEET ITS GOALS-

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:34.633
AND THEN FINALLY IT- TO GET TO

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.235
THE POINT THAT THE CHAIR JUST

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:44.710
MENTIONED WHY CARBS SO IF EVEN.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:45.344
IF MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.346
PROVIDE. OVERSIGHT OF OIL GAS.

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.147
IN THE- WHY IS CARBON ENERGY

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:50.049
CONDUCT EFFORTS- GEN LOCAL AIR

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:52.852
DISTRICTS TO HAVE THE- WERE. FOR

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:53.519
READ. STATIONARY OF POLLUTION.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:54.153
INCLUDING OIL AND IS STILL AND

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.422
SO FAR MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED A

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.890
CAR BROTHER THEN LOCAL AIR

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.558
DISTRICTS SO THAT IT WAS KIND OF

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:01.594
OUR OUR COMMENTS ON THE-

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.194
PROPOSAL SOME OF THE KEY

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:03.696
QUESTIONS WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.164
MIGHT WANT TO. EXPLORE DURING

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:06.065
THE HEARING AND HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:08.034
ANY QUESTIONS YOU UP SOME MISTER

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.770
BROWN. THE LOCAL DISTRICT HAS

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.505
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.107
THESE OIL FACILITIES AND WE

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:18.978
HEARD THE TESTIMONY THAT THE

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.246
CARB. DILLON RIGHT ALONG OR GET

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:24.250
IT TO IN. THAT DAY THAT THE-

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:27.019
WENT WITH THE LOCAL ARTISTIC IS.

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:30.389
ARE THEY SAYING THAT THEY ONE

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:31.891
THEY FOUND THIS WEEK THAT THEY

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:34.026
WOULD HAVE ONLY FOUND IT BECAUSE

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:35.928
CARP WAS THERE IN THE LOCAL AIR.

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.264
DISTRICT WOULDN'T FOUND THAT WE

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.032
COULD YOU HAVE YOU HAVE ANY. ANY

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.801
EVIDENCE OR ANY INFORMATION THAT

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.436
THAT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:45.738
AREN'T DOING THEIR JOB ON

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:46.839
REGULAR LEAKS THAT THEY WITH

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:50.709
FINE. I MEAN I THINK THAT'S ONE

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:52.011
OF THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.379
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A- CLEAR

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:56.048
ANSWER TO- THE POINT YOU'RE JUST

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:57.349
MAKING IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:59.018
THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS WHATEVER

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:00.686
KIND OF IDENTIFIED THAT. WEEK

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:04.223
ANYWAYS AND TRY TO ADDRESS IT

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.125
AND SO IT'S SORT OF THE- H. ARE

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:07.593
A MAGNITUDE OF KIND OF DIFFERENT

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.994
PROBLEM I THINK THAT IT'S KIND

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:11.263
OF A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT FOR US

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.164
TO. TO KIND OF WRAP HER HEAD

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.233
AROUND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.634
EVIDENCE THAT. HE'S SAYING THAT

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.002
THE WORKERS ARE SO FAR I'M

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.304
KINDA. IT IS A- BIG PROBLEM AT

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.072
THIS POINT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.040
THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT I THINK

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.075
THAT'S KIND OF AN ISSUE THAT WE

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:25.478
I THINK DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GOOD

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:26.979
INFORMATION. RIGHT NOW IN THIS

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.347
PCP IN FRONT OF YOU DO YOU SEE

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.616
IT AS DUPLICATIVE. ARE YOU IS IT

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:32.685
CLEAR TO YOU THAT IT'S A GOOD

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:33.285
DUPLICATIVE INSPECTIONS THAT

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.120
THEY COULD DO THAT THEY'RE GOING

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:36.088
TO DO- OR IS IT COULD BE

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:37.056
INDEPENDENT. INSPECTIONS AS A

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.357
GOOD U. S. STATIONARY SOURCES.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.226
WHICH IS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:40.659
HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:42.361
RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEY WOULD DO

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.898
THE INSPECTION. OR SET UNCLEAR

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:48.067
TO YOU. THAT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:50.136
I THINK THE WAY. THAT- WE HAVE

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:53.005
UNDERSTOOD IT IS THAT THAT- IT

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.340
WOULD BE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.475
WHERE THE PARK STAFF WAS KIND OF

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:57.910
GO ALONG WITH THEIR DISTRICT

00:12:57.977 --> 00:13:00.913
STAFF TO KIND OF MONITOR- ANY

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.882
KIND OF CONDUCT INSPECTIONS

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.583
ALTHOUGH BUT- YOU KNOW AND

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.352
THAT'S A QUESTION YOU MIGHT WANT

00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:08.687
TO ASK THE BOARD JUST TO CLARIFY

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:09.288
EXACTLY KIND OF THAT YOU KNOW

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.222
PRACTICE GOING TO HELP THOSE

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.324
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR. YOU AND

OCULAR- AT FINANCE. WOULD YOU

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:18.898

AMERICA FROM THEIR FORMER

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:32.344
FINANCE HOW WE ARE GOING TO-

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:34.847
TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO COURT

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:40.619
IS. ALLEGEDLY NOT A NEW PROGRAM

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:43.088
AND THAT IT SAY YOU WERE DOING A

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:45.925
JOINT INSPECTION AND ARE YOU I

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.359
GUESS ARE YOU SAYING THAT

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:49.495
FINDING THESE LEAKS WAS ONLY

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.597
BECAUSE DUE TO CARP STAFF OR WAS

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:59.438
THAT. JOINTLY DISCOVERED. IT'S

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.774
NOT A QUESTION FOR ME YES YES

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.343
YES I'M NO I'M NOT WE'RE NOT

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.045
MISS IT SO THE WAY THAT THE WAY

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:08.080
THAT IT WORKS SO THE DISTRICT

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:09.515
HAS PRIMARY FORTY OVER CERTAIN

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:12.184
POLLUTANTS- CARB HAS

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:13.852
RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULATE

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:15.754
GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTANTS WHICH

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:17.523
IS PRIMARILY METHANE FROM THE

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.693
SOURCES- AND SO- AND THEN WE

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.895
ALSO DELEGATE SOME OF THE A

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.964
FORTY TWO AND FOUR STAR RANK TO

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.131
LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS BUT NOT ALL

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:27.766
THAT FAIR DISTRICTS DO THAT- AND

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:30.035
SO WE ARE OUT AND HAVE PRIMARY

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:31.403
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCING OUR

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.572
METHANE RULE- THE DISTRICTS ARE

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.040
OUT AT THESE FACILITIES AND

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:37.543
FORCING THEIR OWN REGULATIONS-

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.012
F. AND THEN SO IF WE GO OUT WE

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.046
OFTEN GO WITH THE DISTRICT.

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:43.649
WE'RE BOTH KIND OF LOOKING FOR

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:44.850
DIFFERENT THINGS- IF THE

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.452
DISTRICT HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:47.620
IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER YOU TO

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:49.321
ALSO LOOK AT THE METHANE RULE

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.657
WERE OUT THERE ARE OUT THERE

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:52.958
WITH- ENSURING THAT WERE IN THE

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.526
LOOP IN TERMS OF ON WHAT WE'RE

WERE ALL CONSISTENT AND HOW WERE

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:00.432
IN FORCE IN THE RAKES AND

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.268
IDENTIFY IN THE WEEKS- IF WE

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:04.637
IDENTIFY LEAKS THAT ARE WITHIN

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:05.738
THE DISTRICT'S PURVIEW THEN WE

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:07.072
LET THEM KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.675
WE FOUND AND THEY FOLLOW UP AND

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.743
PURSUE WHATEVER ACTION IS

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:12.578
NEEDED. SO GOING IF THIS

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:14.680
PROPOSAL IS APPROVED YOU

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.615
ANTICIPATE THAT YOUR STAFF WILL

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:18.751
BE DOING THESE INSPECTIONS

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:19.251
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE AIR

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:21.920
DISTRICTS WE DO THEM SOMETIMES

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:24.923
INDEPENDENTLY- IF FOR EXAMPLE A

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.525
DISTRICTS NOT ABLE TO JOIN US

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.027
AND WE DO REACH OUT TO THE

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.295
DISTRICTS EVERY TIME WE'RE GOING

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.997
OUT TO A SITE TO LET THEM KNOW

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:33.198
WE'RE GOING AND INVITE THEM TO

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.501
COME ALONG WITH US SO WE'LL GET

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:36.235
TO THE HUNDRED SEVENTY

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:37.269
COMPLAINTS YOU KNOW WE RECEIVED

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:38.337
A REPORT THAT TALKED ABOUT

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:39.204
NOTHING AND THAT AND THE

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.907
CHALLENGE WITH MATH AND WE KNOW

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:42.708
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.443
WHOLE WORLD IS TRYING TO DO A

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.544
LOT ABOUT METHANE. AND WE HEARD

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.280
WE WERE LOOKING AT GAS

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.915
FACILITIES AND WILL FACILITIES

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:52.051
TRANSPORTATION AND IT WAS LIKE

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.086
THREE OR 4% OF THIS OF THE

00:15:54.153 --> 00:16:00.059
STATE'S METHANE IS FROM. LEAKS

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.960
AND THEN CITY 6% OF. PER IS FROM

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:04.029
LIKE. AND THINGS LIKE TO. SO

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.164
JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT I'M

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.799
CURIOUS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.867
ANYTHING COME OUT FROM CARP. ON

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.769
VERY TIGHT GESTURES OR AMP IN

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:13.005
THE AGRICULTURAL NOTHING ON

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:14.606
LANDFILLS WHICH ARE A BIG SOURCE

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.742
NOTHING ON FORGET PICKS THAT ARE

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:18.644
ARE. ARE CREATING METHANE

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.412
ABSOLUTE QUIET BUT THAT ON THIS

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:24.650
SMALL LITTLE. 4% FOR OIL LEAKS-

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:26.652
WE GOT A WHOLE A WHOLE NEW

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.153
PROGRAM SO I JUST PUT THAT OUT

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.256
THERE TO GIVE SOME TEXTURE TO.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:33.859
THAT THE BIGGER PICTURE- SO WHEN

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.694
YOU RECEIVE COMPLAINTS HE SAID

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:37.296
YOU THE TESTIFIED THAT YOU CAN

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.965
YOU GET. YOUR RECEIVE A LOT OF

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:42.668
COMPLAINTS A HUNDRED SEVENTY

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:46.972
PEOPLE- THESE ARE DIFFERENT FROM

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:50.175
THE FROM- THE RIGHT ALONG WHEN

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:51.243
YOU WRITE THAT THAT WAS THAT YOU

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.178
JUST YOU GOT SOME INFORMATION.

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:56.181
BY WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.182
COMPLAINTS RIGHT NOW ARE THE

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.852
COMPLAINTS DO YOU. TOSS THEM OR

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:01.453
PASS THEM ON TO THE AIR DISTRICT

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.355
WHEN SOMEBODY COME CALLS UP

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:07.092
WERE- WITH THIS ONE PERSON THAT

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.160
GETS TO RECEIVE SOME WHAT

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:11.263
HAPPENS. BUT WE DO REFER

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.364
COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET TO THEIR

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:15.534
DISTRICTS- AND AGAIN WE DO HAVE

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:17.703
ONE PERSON- DEDICATED TO OIL AND

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.605
GAS AND FORSMAN AND SO THEY DO

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:21.807
THEIR BEST TO INVESTIGATE. BUT

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.142
WITH THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:24.943
THAT WERE RECEIVING- WE DON'T

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.312
HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO AT THIS

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:31.116
MOMENT- TO INVESTIGATE IN DEPTH.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:34.086
ALL OF THEM- AND TO TRY TO

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:36.622
DETERMINE WHY WE ARE RECEIVING

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:39.792
THESE COMPLAINTS. BECAUSE RIGHT

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:45.898
WELL. IT I GUESS THE QUESTION OF

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.867
THE FOLLOW UP IS THAT IF YOU.

00:17:48.934 --> 00:17:50.502
YOU SAID THAT THE- DISTRICT YOU

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:51.370
DON'T YOU'RE NOT IN THE CAME

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.705
THAT THE OR DISTRICTS ARE DOING

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:55.407
THEIR JOBS BUT IF YOU GIVE THEM

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:56.708
THESE COMPLAINTS TODAY DID YOU

00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:58.410
GET SOME REPORT BACK THAT IT'S

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:00.312
BEEN REMEDIED OR ANYTHING LIKE

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.914
OUT OF THE OF OR SOME

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.816
INVESTIGATION OR SOMETHING WE

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.317
KNOW ABOUT THIS MORE WORKING ON

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:08.053
IT. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE WHAT DOES

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.588
THAT LOOK LIKE. WE DO COORDINATE

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.223
WITH THEIR DISTRICTS WE DO ALSO

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.724
STILL RECEIVE COMPLAINTS FROM

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:18.063
COMMUNITIES. SO. THE NEW STAFF

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.033
THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. HOW MANY

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:22.401
OF THOSE COMPLAINTS DO YOU THINK

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.002
ARE GOING TO BE ACTION THAT YOU

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:26.104
GUYS TO GET A TAKE VERSUS VERSUS

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:27.773
GETTING MORE INFORMATION TO THE

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.875
MAKING SURE THEY ALL GET PASSED

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:30.709
ON TO THE AIRPORTS THE LOCAL

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:34.613
AIRPORTS I MEAN WHAT. WHAT IS IT

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.216
THAT YOUR STAFF IS GOING TO DO.

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:38.884
SO I THINK WE INTO YOUR INITIAL

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.486
QUESTION I THINK IT'S HARD TO

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:43.021
KNOW- BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:45.390
TO. SORT OF DIVING A LITTLE

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.159
DEEPER TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.828
WHAT THE ISSUES ARE- AND WHY

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.096
WE'RE RECEIVING ALL OF THESE

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:54.266
COMPLAINTS- BUT WHAT WE WOULD BE

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:56.468
DOING IS. THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:57.970
RECEIVE WE WOULD INVESTIGATE WE

00:18:58.036 --> 00:18:59.872
WOULD DO INSPECTIONS WE WOULD

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:01.240
ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH OUR

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.541

DISTRICT PROGRAMS AND PERMITS

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:19.124
AND MAKING SURE THAT- YOU KNOW

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:20.292
THAT ALL OF THE AIR QUALITY

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:22.060
REGULATIONS ARE ARE SORT OF

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:23.428
HEALTH PROTECTIVE AND MEETING

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.097
OUR AIR QUALITY GOALS. NOW DO

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:26.732
YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THIS STAFF

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.133
WILL BE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE THEY

GET TO BE IN THE VICINITY OF

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:33.372
THESE OIL. FACILITIES THAT'S A

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:36.308
GOOD QUESTION I. PROBABLY IN

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.010
BOTH OKAY WE HAVE A SACRAMENT WE

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:40.279
HAVE A STOMACH CAL LOCATION SO I

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.713
THINK BEING IN BOTH LOCATIONS

WOULD BE IDEAL. AND OUR IS THE

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:56.428

HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES WE HAVE

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:35.127
THE ONE THE ONE P. Y. ON THE OIL

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:37.396
AND GAS. SO IT'S YOU IT'S YOUR

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:39.064
TESTIMONY THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:42.768
CANNOT BE USED TO SPOT

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:44.703
INSPECTIONS AT THE SPOIL.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.873
FACILITIES RIGHT. THEY CAN'T GET

SPENT THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.914
QUESTIONING. ONE POINT SEVEN

00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:04.816
MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE OIL

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:05.951
AND GAS OVERSIGHT WHEN THERE'S

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:07.686

BOARD TO OVERSEE THE ENTIRE

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:12.958
INDUSTRY. ENFORCING A METHANE

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:15.894
RULE- THAT IS WOEFULLY UNDER

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:17.829
ENFORCED AND- EVIDENCE SHOWS

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:18.997
THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS AREN'T

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:21.099
GETTING THE JOB DONE ON THEIR

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.534
OWN- POLLUTION RULES BEEN

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.369
REJECTED BY THE EPA RECENTLY IN

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:26.905
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND TO CALL

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:29.141
IT ANYTHING TO CALL IT SMALL IN

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:32.043
A QUIET AND SMALL ISSUE- MEANS

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.178
THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN WHAT IT'S

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.881
LIKE TO HAVE A LEASE SO CANYON

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:36.948
GO POISON TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OR

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:38.717
EVEN ALL OF SANTA MONICA BE SHUT

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.786
DOWN YESTERDAY FOR TWELVE HOURS

00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:43.088
BECAUSE- THERE'S A MASSIVE

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:45.824
GHASTLY- THIS IS HAPPENING ALL

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.259
THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH PLAN IN THE

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:49.361
CENTRAL VALLEY AND IT MAY NOT BE

00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:50.862
A- BIG OF A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:53.365
ISSUE. BUT IT IS ANYTHING BUT

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:55.233
SMALL AND QUIET IN LA WE HAVE

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.302
THOUSANDS OF SITES THAT

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:59.604
DESPERATELY ARE IN NEED OF

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:00.772
INSPECTION THAT THERE WOEFULLY

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:03.809
UNDER EQUIPPED. EITHER UNWILLING

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:04.576
OR UNABLE TO INSPECT THESE

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:07.078
SITES. AND I'M YOU KNOW I MIGHT

00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:09.047
MIGHT MY QUESTION OR MY CONCERN

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:11.249
IS THAT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. I DO

00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:12.951
THINK THAT THE AIRPORT IS GOING

00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:15.053
TO HAVE TO TAKE SOME SEMI

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.158
INDEPENDENT. LEADERSHIP HERE IN.

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:22.027
ADDRESSING THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:24.095
SIDE OF THESE FACILITIES

00:24:24.162 --> 00:24:26.665
THEMSELVES BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:29.000
HAPPENING- THERE ARE THERE'S

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:31.670
METHANE LEAKING IN A PLUME ALL

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:35.307
OVER. LOS ANGELES AND THE SOUTH

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:37.442
COAST IS NOT BEEN ABLE TO TELL

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:39.311
US WHY. INITIAL ESTIMATES FROM

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.646
BOTH NASA AND UCLA HAVE SHOWN

00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:43.682
THAT THERE IS AN ACCUMULATION OF

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:46.384
LEAKS FROM- THOUSANDS OF

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.253
ABANDONED OR IDLE OIL AND GAS

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.488
AND IT'S ALL OVER LA SO. THE

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.557
NOTION OF PUSHING BACK ON A

00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:54.292
MILLION SEVEN WHEN WE'VE GOT A

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:56.228
FORTY OR MILLION FOR WHEN WE'VE

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:57.796
GOT A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR

00:24:57.863 --> 00:24:59.297
BUDGET SURPLUS ON OUR HANDS

00:24:59.364 --> 00:25:01.733
SEEMS TO ME. A LITTLE BIT

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.303
MISSING THE BURNING FOREST FOR A

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.607
TREAT- I WOULD JUST ASK THE

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:11.276
AIRBOARD- IN IN LOS ANGELES

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:14.846
ALONE. HOW MANY SITES DO YOU

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:16.948
ANTICIPATE I MEAN IN TERMS OF

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:18.917
LOOKING AT THE OVERALL METHANE

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:20.485
FOOTPRINT OF A PLACE LIKE THAT

00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:21.786
WHERE. IT'S NOT JUST REFINING

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:24.856
BUT LEGACY OIL AND GAS WELLS.

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:27.559
HOW MUCH OF THAT WORKLOAD DO YOU

00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:29.594
THINK THIS. MODEST REQUEST IS

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:36.201
GOING TO COVER. I YEAH I DON'T

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:38.837
HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER ON THAT-

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:41.106
BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY- SEVERAL

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:43.742
SITES IN THAT REGION AND OTHER

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:45.410
AREAS OF THE STATE THAT WILL BE

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:48.380
FOCUSING ON- I DON'T HAVE THE

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:50.315
EXACT NUMBER FOR THAT. HOW MANY

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.117
SITES DO YOU KNOW TOTAL NOT HOW

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.318
MANY THIS WILL COVER BUT HOW

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:57.155
MANY SITES. ARE THERE IN SAY THE

00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:59.824
STATE OVERALL THAT ARE THE

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:01.626
TARGET OF THE METHANE RULE. FOR

00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:07.198
OIL AND GAS. I CAN GET BACK TO

00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:09.334
YOU I'M NOT- I DON'T HAVE THAT

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.937
DIDN'T HUNDREDS OR IS IT IN THE

00:26:12.003 --> 00:26:14.339
THOUSANDS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY. DO

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:15.974
IF IT'S OKAY CAN I CAN I GET

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.809
BACK TO YOU I'M I'M GONNA SAY

00:26:17.876 --> 00:26:20.812
THOUSANDS- BUT I DON'T HAVE THE

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:23.581
EXACT NUMBER OFF HAND. OKAY ENDS

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:27.352
AND IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:31.189
MONITOR- MONITOR THESE SITES I

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.857
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A

00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:35.760
PUBLIC HEALTH RULE ALSO PENDING

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:38.196
BEFORE CAL JIM WE'VE BEEN

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.831
LOOKING IN OVERSEEING THAT ISSUE

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.366
IN TERMS OF NEIGHBORHOOD OIL AND

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:44.269
GAS DRILLING- WITH THE SENATE

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:46.371
NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. IS

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:50.175
YOUR IS YOUR INTENTION HERE THAT

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:52.377
- THAT THESE KIND OF THIS KIND

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.712
OF ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:56.681
PROTECTION COULD DOVE TAIL WITH

00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:58.817
OVERALL ENHANCED MONITORING AND

00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:00.552
ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS AROUND

00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:02.754
PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN IT COMES TO

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:03.755
NEIGHBORHOOD OIL AND GAS

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:07.258
DRILLING. YES I DO THINK THAT-

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:08.793
ALL OF THESE EFFORTS SORT OF

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.230
COORDINATE AND- OUR PLAN IS TO

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:13.465
COORDINATE WITH ALL- RELEVANT

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:15.400
AGENCIES INVOLVED- WITH THESE

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.302
FACILITIES OKAY WELL IF YOU

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.770
COULD JUST GET BACK TO US I

00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:20.772
THINK IT BE INTERESTING TO SEE

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:23.408
HOW MUCH OF THE- HOW MUCH. OF

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.976
THE STATE GOES ON INSPECTED

00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:27.012
RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT YOU THINK

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:28.913
THIS THE SIX POSITIONS COULD

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.582
COVER IN TERMS OF THAT TOTAL

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:32.117
WORKLOAD I THINK THAT WOULD HELP

00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:33.518
WHILE. IF WE HOLD THIS OPEN

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:36.554
TODAY ESPECIALLY TO MAKE A- A

00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:38.256
LITTLE STRONGER AND WELL

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.758
PREPARED BETTER WELL PREPARED

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:41.092
CASE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:42.193
BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.062
STRONG CASE TO BE MADE HERE BUT

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:46.231
I DO THINK IT'S WORTH. FLESHING

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:47.232
OUT THESE DETAILS AND I

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:49.367
ANTICIPATE ONCE WE DO SO THAT

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:51.102
WILL FIND THAT THE ENTIRE STATE

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.771
OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T KNOW WHAT

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:54.672
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT THERE'S-

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:57.442
INVISIBLE. AND UNDETECTED

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.511
PROBLEMS OCCURRING ALL OVER THE

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:01.246
PLACE THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS ARE

00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:04.349
SIMPLY UNABLE TO COVER SO WITH

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:33.618
OF THE PROPOSAL WAS REALLY AIMED

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:37.855
AT AT RETURNING THESE- DOLLARS

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:40.424
AND SENSE BACK TO CONSUMERS- WE

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:42.026
BELIEVE THAT THIS MONEY BELONGS

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.394
TO THEM THIS IS THEIR MONEY AND

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:45.830
WE LIKE TO DO. TO GET IT BACK TO

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:47.264
CONSUMERS AND WE THINK THAT

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:48.666
PROVIDING THIS CONSUMER CREDIT

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:50.835
IS AN INCENTIVE TO GO INTO THE

00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:54.171
INTO YOU AT THE TREASURE TROVES

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:57.408
OF RECYCLING AND MATERIALS THAT

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.476
AND BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:00.277
PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR GARAGES AND

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:02.346
BRING THOSE OUT. AND GET THEM

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.281
RECYCLED SO CREATING A SHORT

00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:06.217
TERM PROGRAM BY WHICH WOULD

00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:07.685
HOPEFULLY BE AN INCENTIVE FOR

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:09.854
CONSUMERS TO BRING BACK- THE

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.122
BOTTLES AND CANS THAT THEY HAVE

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:16.293
IN THEIR GARAGES AND THEN WE.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.094
HAV ANOTHER- TEN MILLION

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.262
DOLLARS FOR NEW INVEST.

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:19.764
TECHNOLOGY AND WORKFORCE

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.166
DEVELOPMENT- AND WITH THAT

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:25.269
SENATOR AND I HAD TURNED IT BACK

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:28.906
TO YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.142
WITH THE L. A- DO YOU HAVE AN

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:33.277
OPINION ON THE P. C. P. PROPOSAL

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:36.747
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. HELLO

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.149

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:40.051
BROWN WITH THE LA- WE DO HAVE

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:42.820
SOME COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL-

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.622
SO WE DO THINK GIVEN RECENT

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.323
DECLINES AND RECYCLING RATES AND

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.859
CONSUMER ACCESS. TO RECYCLING

00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:50.761
OPPORTUNITIES AND A SUBSTANTIAL

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:53.097
FINE BALANCE IN THE FUND WE

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.031
THINK PROVIDING SOMEONE TIME

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.166
FUNDING TO TRY TO IMPROVE

00:38:55.232 --> 00:38:56.100
PROGRAM OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:58.803
LOT OF MERIT. HOWEVER WE THINK

00:38:58.869 --> 00:38:59.336
THE SPECIFIC PACKAGE OF

00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:01.305
PROPOSALS HERE LACKS SOME KEY

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:02.039
DETAILS AND RAISES SOME

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:03.841
IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS FOR

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:05.876
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. AND

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.211
SIMILAR TO LAST ITEM ASTON

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:09.413
MINISTRATION TO ADDRESS

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.848
IMMIGRANTS DAYS SO NO RUN

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:12.349
THROUGH SOME OF THOSE- KEY

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:14.185
QUESTIONS WE HAVE FOUR OF THEM.

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:16.320
SO FIRST DOES THE PROPOSAL

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:18.622
ADDRESS A ORDERS OF THE SPECIFIC

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.391
PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL ADDRESS A

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.359
WELL IDENTIFIED PROBLEM SO

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:24.095
CERTAIN PIECES SUCH AS THE

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:25.696
AUTOMATIC RECYCLING MACHINES

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:26.697
WE'VE BEEN CONTENT TO ADDRESS A

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:28.132
VERY WELL KNOWN PROBLEM OF

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.568
CONSUMER ACCESS TO. RECYCLING

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:32.203
OPPORTUNITIES HOWEVER IN OTHER

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.938
CASES. WE THINK THE

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:34.805
ADMINISTRATION HASN'T CLEARLY

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.574
IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM OR

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.342
EXACTLY HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.077
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SO. FOR

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:41.512
EXAMPLE- ACCORDING TO

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:42.747
ADMINISTRATION THE HUNDRED

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:43.614
MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU JUST

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:46.183
HEARD ABOUT FOR THE TEMPORARY

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.352
INCREASE IN C. R. V. VALUE- IS

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:49.687
MEANT TO ADDRESS THE KIND OF

00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:51.489
LARGE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS THAT

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:52.790
CONSUMERS PURCHASED DURING THE

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:55.426
PANDEMIC AND THAT ARE. ACTUALLY

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:57.228
STORING. HOWEVER WE HAVEN'T YET

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:58.462
SEEN MUCH KIND OF CONVINCING

00:39:58.529 --> 00:39:59.864
EVIDENCE THAT CONSUMERS ARE

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.832
STORING LARGE AMOUNTS OF

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.000
CONTAINERS THAT THEY PURCHASED

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.069
DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT EVEN IF

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.604
THEY ARE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW A

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.872
TEMPORARY INCREASE IN THE

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:09.673
BENEFIT ODING HER INTRODUCTION

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.908
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:13.144
HEARD SO PRESUMABLY. CONSUMERS

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.378
RESTORING BEVERAGE CONTAINERS

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.846
WITH SOME INTENSE READING THEM

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.448
IN THE FUTURE AND A TEMPORARY

00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:19.283
INCREASE IN THE C. R. V.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.685
ASSEMBLY SHIFT THE DATE BUT THE

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:22.820
CONCEPT IN GENERAL ARE GAMES BUT

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.455
HAVE VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON THE

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:33.497
OVERALL NUMBERS OF CONTAINERS.

00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:34.431
THAT ARE EVENTUALLY RECYCLES. SO

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:36.333
SECOND. QUESTION WE THINK HOW IF

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.935
IS EACH PIECE OF THE PROPOSED

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:40.437
ADDRESS- THEY PROBLEM IS BUT I-

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:41.605
THE MINISTRY HASN'T PROVIDED.

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:42.873
AND ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.676
PROPOSED SIX. TO THE RECYCLING

00:40:45.743 --> 00:40:47.278
GOALS INCREASE IN RECYCLING RATE

00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:49.814
SOARING. IN AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.448
WONDER UNITS. TO REPORT ON THE

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:52.817
REGIONAL. EACH PROGRAM TO

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:54.718
EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE SOME OF

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:58.155
THESE DIFFERENT GOAL. THIRD THIS

00:40:58.222 --> 00:40:59.957
RELATES TO THE- PREVIOUS POINT

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:01.458
HOWEVER THERE IS A FROM THE-

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.360
PILOT PROGRAMS AND FORM THIS

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.962
PROPOSAL SAID THE COMMITTEE I'M

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.630
IS AWARE OF HOW RECYCLE AND

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:07.431
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:09.633
IMPLEMENTING. FIVE PILOTS AIMED

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.734
AT EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:13.137
PRODUCTION OPTIONS- AND IS

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:15.306
PLANNING TO EXPAND BASED ON-

00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:17.374
BUDGET ACTIONS TAKEN LAST YEAR

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:19.276
TO AN ADDITIONAL FIVE PILOTS-

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.477
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:22.012
CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THESE

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.013
PILOTS YEAH AND SO THE

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.515
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANNA DIRECT

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.083
ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON THE

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.918
PROGRESS OF THOSE PILOTS. WHAT

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.787
ARE SOME OF THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES

00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:31.288
G. LESSONS LEARNED. AND HOW

00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:34.058
THOSE PILOTS HAVE INFORMED US-

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:35.459
THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL ENOUGH

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:38.662
IF NO RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE THE

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:39.663
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. THE

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:45.436
WAY. FUNDING AND SO MORE. IT'S

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:48.372
AVAILABLE. AND THEN THE FINAL

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.608
ISSUE OF IS DOES THE HAS ON TO

00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:52.109
HAVE SO THE LEGISLATURE MY WANT

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.277
TO CAN WAYS TO TARGET FUNDING

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:55.079
ACTIVE THERE ARE WE DON'T ON THE

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:57.681
REST LIKE RATES AND RATHER THAN

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:58.916
THIS ONE TIME BUT- WE THINK THAT

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.050
SOME OF THE IN PROPOSAL HAVE THE

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.385
POTENTIAL TO INCREASE RECYCLING

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.387
ON AN ONGOING BASIS SUCH AS THE

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:05.189
AUTOMATIC RECYCLING MACHINES IN

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:08.058
SUPERMARKETS- PROVIDING LOANS TO

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.393
RECYCLERS I CAN BE FORGIVEN IF

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.195
THE RECYCLER OPERATES FOR A

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.930
MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME. IN OTHER

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:15.065
CASES SUCH AS THAT THE INCREASED

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:16.901
TEMPORARY C. R. B. VALUE THE

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:18.402
PROPOSAL WOULD LIKELY YIELD ONLY

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:21.272
A LIMITED TERM RESULTS AND SO

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:22.172
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO-

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:23.874
DIRECT ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:24.909
WHICH PROGRAMS ARE MOST LIKELY

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:26.343
TO HAVE THOSE LONG TERM

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.012
RECYCLING BENEFITS AND PERHAPS

00:42:28.078 --> 00:42:29.480
FOCUS FUNDING PRIMARILY ON THOSE

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:32.249
TYPES OF EFFORTS SO THAT SO

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:33.651
THAT- IN MY COMMENTS THERE AND

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.019

BE GREATER WELL THAT'S

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:58.702
INTERESTING SHALL NOT BE GREATER

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:19.323
AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ALSO

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.524
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:22.526
INFORMATION TO YOUR STAFF AT A

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:24.128
LATER POINT SO- FIRST AND

00:44:24.194 --> 00:44:25.929
FOREMOST BE LANGUAGE THAT YOU'RE

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:28.465
REFERRING TO. THE 5% FOR THE

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:30.534
RESERVE IS DIFFERENT FROM-

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:32.336
LEGALLY DEFINED FOR AN EXISTING

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:35.272
FUND BALANCE SO A RESERVE IS

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.341
BASICALLY DEFINED AS A

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:38.609
CONTINGENCY RESERVE THAT IS

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:40.177
UTILIZED IN STEARNS

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:41.912
CIRCUMSTANCES PARTICULARLY FOR

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:43.647
WHEN THERE'S ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:46.717
AND IT IS. ACTUALLY ASIDE FOR

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:48.886
THAT PURPOSE. THE EXISTING FUND

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:50.721
BALANCE IS AN ACCUMULATION OF

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:52.322
SIGNIFICANT REVENUES THAT

00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:54.224
ACCUMULATED OVER TIME COMPARED

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:55.526
TO THE AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURES

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:57.261
THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED. FOR

00:44:57.327 --> 00:44:59.063
THOSE YEARS AND SO FOR THAT

00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:01.065
PURPOSE THAT DIFFERENCE IN THAT

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.466
LANGUAGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:06.437
APPLY IN. THIS PARTICULAR

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:08.272
SITUATION. WELL A FEW MONTHS AGO

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:10.040
- CAL RECYCLE WAS BEFORE US AND

00:45:10.107 --> 00:45:11.742
THEY SAID THE RESERVE AT THAT

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:14.645
TIME WAS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:16.713
NINE MILLION- AND- NOW THE

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.215
DEPARTMENT REPORTS THAT THE FUND

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:20.918
BALANCE IS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:22.052
FIVE MILLION WHICH IS AND-

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:23.720
ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION MORE.

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:26.156
BUT YOUR CALCULATION YOUR BCP

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:28.225
HASN'T CHANGED. AT LEAST AT

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:30.227
LEAST WE GOT THAT NUMBER

00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:31.195
WOULDN'T SHOULD THERE BE AN

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:33.097
ADJUSTMENT. EVEN GIVEN YOUR

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:35.365
LIMITED INTERPRETATION OF THE 5%

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:41.038
CONTINGENCY FUND. SO I PROBABLY

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:42.272
WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.208
AGAIN THERE'S JUST THE NEW ONES

00:45:44.274 --> 00:45:46.276
THERE- IN TERMS OF A RESERVE AND

00:45:46.343 --> 00:45:48.979
A FINE BALANCE THE EASY P. DOES

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:50.948
HAVE IT UPDATED AND MOST RECENT

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:53.350
UPDATED BY THE VISION STATEMENT.

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:56.520
WHICH IS- THE MOST RECENT ACTUAL

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.188
NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE FOR THE

00:45:58.255 --> 00:46:00.257
CURRENT YEAR- AS WELL AS THE

00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:02.059
PROJECTED FUND BALANCE FOR THE

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:04.461
BUDGET YEAR SO AS YOU NOTED THE

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:06.163
NUMBERS IN THE B. C. P. ARE THE

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.798
MOST RECENT NUMBERS THAT THE

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:09.700
ADMINISTRATION HAS. AT THIS

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.902
POINT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:13.770
MOST OF US HERE IN THE

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:16.773
LEGISLATURE LOOK AT A MINIMUM

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.208
REQUIREMENT CAN YOU COMMENT ON

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:19.877
THE MAXIMUM REQUIREMENT THERE'S

00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:21.879
THIS IS AN ODD THING THAT YOU

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:26.717
SAY THE MAXIMUM RESERVE SHALL BE

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.685
YOU KNOW. 5% AND EVEN THEN YEAR

00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:31.855
EVEN IN YOUR CALCULATION IT WITH

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:32.856
THE CONTINGENCY THE RESERVE

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:38.262
LIMIT. DOESN'T THAT REQUIRE A

00:46:38.328 --> 00:46:39.429
DIFFERENT CALCULATION BY

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:43.500
FINANCING BY THE CAL RECYCLE.

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:44.668
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:46.136
I HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU I

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.572
AND I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:49.273
CONCERNS AND HOW WE GENERALLY

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:51.141
LOOK MOST OF THE TIME AT

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:54.311
MINIMUM- VERSES MAXIMUM- BUT I

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:56.346
WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO FOLLOW

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:57.147
UP WELL LET ME PUT A DIFFERENT

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:58.849
WAY WHAT'S A HEALTHY RESERVE

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.784
RIGHT WHAT THE HELL TO RESERVE

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:06.490
WE HAVE YOU KNOW. THE- P. R. C.

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:07.991
ONE FOUR FIVE EIGHT ZERO PRINT

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:09.793
TO SEIZE A PRINCESS TO THE TALK

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.427
ABOUT. CONTINGENCY WHAT DO YOU

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:12.196
WHAT THIS FINANCE WHAT THIS IS

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:12.963
SAID MINISTRATION THINK AS I

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.698
HELP THE RESERVE- FOR PEOPLE'S

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:17.734
DEPOSITS. THAT ARE BEING HELD.

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:21.638
DO WE HAVE A NUMBER THERE. WHEN

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:23.874
IT IS TIME FOR A MINIMUM

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.375
RESEARCH FOR THIS ARTICLE I MEAN

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:28.612
LOOKING AT IT DIFFERENTLY. IT

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:34.451
OKAY- YEAH YES THEIR DRIVER PART

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.253
OF FINE AND- DID YOU HAVE BEEN A

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.755
LITTLE BIT HERE TO- SO.

00:47:38.822 --> 00:47:39.990
GENERALLY WORK FOR MANY

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:41.491
DIFFERENT TACK TO FIND YOU KNOW

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:44.328
WE THINK ABOUT LIKE- 5210% KIND

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:45.462
OF YOU KNOW GOOD RESERVE

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:47.331
RESERVE. HOWEVER IN CERTAIN

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:49.933
CASES. WHERE THERE'S POTENTIAL

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.436
VOLATILITY WITH EITHER THE LEVEL

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.705
OF RAM YOU ALREADY PATRICK I'M

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:56.073
TRYING TO TAKE A LOT MORE

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.507
PRUDENT TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:59.676
OVER THERE. IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:01.011
THERE'S I THINK YOU HAVE

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:03.280
UNDERLYING FACTORS WHY WE DO

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.616
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS. A KIND OF

00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:06.950
MORE PRUDENT LEVEL TO HAVE A

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:09.486
LITTLE BIT OF A I RESERVE I

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:10.420
THINK ONE IS. WHEN WE'RE

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:12.456
THINKING ABOUT THE REVENUES OVER

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:13.790
THE COURSE OF ENDEMIC WE THOUGHT

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:14.958
YOUR CONSUMER BEHAVIOR

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:17.194
TECHNICALLY CHANGED TO WHAT IT

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:19.363
WAS BEFORE. NOW THAT THE CURRENT

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:21.498
CONDITION THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.600
THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT DOES

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:25.569
THE FILM- CHARACTER AND LEVEL OF

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:28.372
CONTINUED OUR BEHAVIOR LOOK AT

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:29.940
THAT REVENUE FROM. THEIR

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:31.508
PROJECTED CURRENT YEAR AND

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.043
BUDGET YEAR THEY'D MAKE A PRETTY

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.578
FLAT WHICH MEANS THAT WE ARE

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:36.513
MOVING IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHAT

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.515
THE SIMILAR TYPE BEHAVIOR.

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:39.983
HOWEVER THERE STILL EMERGENCY

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.985
AFTER AFTER WHETHER THAT WILL

00:48:42.052 --> 00:48:44.454
ACTUALLY CONTINUE AT THIS POINT

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:46.256
BASED OFF OF THE DAY THAT WE

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:48.492
HAVE- WE THINK IT COULD. BUT NOW

00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:50.294
EVERYTHING'S OPENING BACK UP AND

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.029
BE OF PEOPLE MAY NOT BE BUYING

00:48:52.095 --> 00:48:53.363
IT MAY BORROW GOOD THAT COULD

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:56.033
SIGNIFICANTLY SHAPE. SHIFT WHAT

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:58.335
IT WHAT AT THAT AMPLE THAT AND

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:02.139
THAT UNCERTAINTY OF. ALL REVENUE

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.740
COULD CALL THE RELIEF IMPACT

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:06.710
REFUND ABOUT AND THE THANK THE A

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.912
THIS PROPOSAL- KNOW ONE OF THE

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.380
BIG COMPONENT THAT THE INCREASE

00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:11.882
THE REDUCTION OPPORTUNITY. TO

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:13.984
THEN BE ABLE TO CREATE ACCESS

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:15.719
AND THEN ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:17.521
INCREASE OUR RECYCLING RATE

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:18.722
WHICH INCREASED IN THE REFINERY

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:20.657
IS IT'S GOOD BECAUSE WE WANT TO

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:23.393

BALANCE. AND FLOW WOULD BE

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.735
THINKING ONE TIME AND- ARE KNOW

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.870
HOPEFULLY WHICH IS OUR GOAL

KNOW. REPEAT THE RV THAT WE GET

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:50.754
OUT. WHICH IS GOING EIGHT THE

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.189
FUND BALANCE IN MOST LIKELY A

00:49:52.255 --> 00:49:53.623
KIND OF THE OUT YOUR- AND WE'RE

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:56.026
NOT BE TWO P. THAT. ARE SOMEWHAT

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:58.195
FOLLOWED TILED- THE FUND BALANCE

00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:00.330
ARE BEING X. PRUDENT THAT

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:01.698
LEAVING A HIGH LEVEL THIRD.

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:02.999
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF WE DON'T AND

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:05.369

RETENTION RATE INCREASE AGAIN.

00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:13.210
THEN KNOW WE MAY GET A NEW AREA

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:15.612
WHERE. WE'RE IT OR A REDUCTION.

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.814
AND LOW. FOR THOSE WHO READ AND

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:19.750
WE CAN GET CASE IT IS MORE TO

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:21.985
HAVE A LITTLE BIT LEVEL RATHER.

FIVE I'VE NEVER MAKE MAKE THEN

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:32.896
IN THIS CASE. IN MAKES SENSE

00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:35.799
THAT GIVER A LITTLE BIT MORE A

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.134
BOOK. YEAH MISTER. THE WHY.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.034
WHAT'S A HEALTHY. IS HE NOW AND

00:50:38.101 --> 00:50:40.203
I WAS A LIE OF INFORMATION

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.338
THERE- WE NOTE THAT THERE HAVE

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:42.939
BEEN A FUN BALANCE WE'VE GOT

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.107
BACK AND FORTH I'VE BEEN FOR

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:46.276
FIVE YEARS MANY OF MY- TO BE.

HERE FOR FIVE YEARS IN THIS

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.279
COMMITTEE ABOUT WHAT THE REPORT

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:50.180
FROM BALANCES GOING TO BE MAY

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:52.682
AND WHAT IT IS IN OCTOBER AND WE

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.551
GO BACK IN. FORTH BOOK WELL I

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:56.420
HAVE I KNOW MEMBERS HAVE

00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:57.654
QUESTIONS THAT THEY WANT TO ASK

00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:00.323
AND WE'RE GOING TO GO. TO THEM

YOUR STAFF ON THE- ROAD YOU HAVE

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:06.363
A COMMENT OR A AND AN- ON THE-

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.465
I'M I'M EQUAL 25% OF THE TOTAL

00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:10.434
AMOUNT PAID TO PROCESSOR. 10% DO

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.636
YOU HAVE WELL I YOU KNOW BECAUSE

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:15.806
OLD HABITS DIE HARD SENATOR AND

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.908
AT YOU KNOW AND READING OF THE

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:19.009
LANGUAGE OF THE COMMITTEE

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:21.011
CONSULTANT I THINK THAT THAT

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:23.513
FIVE PERCENT. THE RESERVE FOR

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.048
CONTINGENCIES WHICH SHALL NOT BE

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:26.917
GREATER THAN AN AMOUNT EQUAL 25%

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:28.285
OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID TO

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:30.287
PROCESSORS AND THE FACT THAT IT

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:32.289
WAS NOT GREATER THAN IS

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:34.291
REFERRING BACK TO THAT SAID A

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:36.159
LANGUAGE RELATING TO YOU

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:38.161
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SO I

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:39.629
THINK WHEN THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:41.631
CRAFTED THIS LANGUAGE IT WAS

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.700
INTENDED TO PREVENT THE AD

LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- WE HAVE

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:18.842
FIVE PILOT PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.477
CURRENTLY RUNNING THEY WERE VERY

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.445
SLOW ON GETTING STARTED BY NO

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:24.414
FAULT OF THEIR OWN UNFORTUNATELY

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:26.149
WE PASSED THAT STATUTE WE PASSED

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.584
THE APPROPRIATION TO HELP THEM

LONG WITH THE REST OF THE PLANET

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:34.057
EACH OF US INDIVIDUALLY WERE HIT

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:36.493
WITH A PANDEMIC THAT IMPEDED THE

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.628
ABILITY TO GET THOSE PILOT

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:40.630

NOW AS OF. TODAY ALL UP AND

00:56:41.931 --> 00:56:43.867
RUNNING AND TESTING SOME REALLY

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:49.072
INTERESTING IDEAS AROUND. SOME

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:50.707
FLEXIBILITY THAT WE CAN

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:51.341
INTEGRATE INTO TO THE STATE. I

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:53.042
FORGET REGION AND TIME. OF

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:55.912
PEOPLE AND GEOGRAPHIC'S I HAD TO

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.614
REALLY THAT PROVIDE A GREATER

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.082
LEVEL OF SERVICE ACROSS THE

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.955
REALLY INTERESTING PILOT PROJECT

WHERE THEY'RE WORKING WITH I

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:09.092
THINK IS THAT FIVE OR SIX

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:10.226
DIFFERENT THIRDS DICTION. WITH

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:13.663
IN ALBANY DID YOU TAKE BACK- AND

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:14.931
IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET THAT

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:16.366
STARTED THAT WAS A LOT TO

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:18.201
ORGANIZE BUT THEY ARE NOW UP AND

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.235
RUNNING AND WE ARE REALLY

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:21.204
EXCITED AND OF AND IT'S GOING TO

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:22.839
TAKE A COUPLE YEARS. BUT WE'RE

00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:24.274
REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:29.379
OUTCOME OF THAT TYPE OF SYSTEM-

00:57:29.445 --> 00:57:30.947
THE PILOT PROJECT IN SAN

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:33.249
FRANCISCO THE ONE AND IRVINE TO

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:34.818
CULVER CITY. SAN MATTEO THEY'RE

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:36.019
ALSO TETING SOME NEW

00:57:36.085 --> 00:57:37.620
TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW TYPES OF

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:39.823
SYSTEMS AND FLEXIBILITIES IN THE

00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:42.158
SYSTEM SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY-

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:44.160
PROPOSING IN THIS PROPOSAL. IS

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:47.063
TO BUILD OFF OF SOME OF THAT.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.798
AND WHAT WORKS ADDITIONALLY

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:52.001
SEEING. IN THE PILOT PROJECTS-

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:53.670
AND USING SOME OF THE STATE

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:55.471
REYES AND DEPLOYING THEM AT THE

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:57.273
STATE LEVEL TO SOME OF THESE

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.775
OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT DON'T

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:00.844
HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO DO IT

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:02.445
THEMSELVES WERE ALSO VERY

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:04.314
EXCITED TO SEE I THINK WE HAD

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.816
CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.918
WEEKS. OUT WITH TEN ADDITIONAL

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:12.055
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE. LOOKING

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:13.356
TO APPLY THE PILOT PROGRAM SO

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.824
THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING IT'S

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.693
JUST VERY EARLY DAYS. SO THEY

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:18.094
JUST WANT TO GO INTO THAT AND

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.996
THROUGH THE CHAIR AND I WANT TO

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:21.831
JUST TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:23.333
SCRAP I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:26.402
CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE SEEING-

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:28.238
THROUGHOUT BUT- SAID. ONE OF THE

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:29.505
SUGGEST BEING CANDID I THINK ONE

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:31.374
OF THE WHY WE'RE SEEING SUCH A

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:32.742
SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS. IS THE LACK

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.277
OF ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:36.913
BE ABLE TO. TURN IN THEIR

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.617
RESPECT RECYCLED MATERIAL. SO WE

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:42.051
HAVE THESE KIND OF PROJECTS-

00:58:42.118 --> 00:58:44.120
MADAM DIRECTOR IF YOU CAN TALK

ABLE TO RE OPEN ON A MORE

00:58:48.391 --> 00:58:50.660
AGGRESSIVE BASIS. AND I TOTALLY

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:52.362
AGREE WITH YOU COVERED HAS

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:53.396

INCLUDING. GETTING NEEDS RURAL

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:57.367
CENTER IS BACK OPEN. BUT I THINK

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:59.168
WHAT YOU SAID VERY ELOQUENTLY TO

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:01.337

YOUR IDEAS ON THAT- IN IN IN

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.814
PARTICULAR FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA.

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.549
YOU REALLY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:14.617
RIGHT YOU'RE EITHER THROWING A

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:16.452
LANDFILL OR YOU'RE TAKING TO

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:17.253
RECYCLING CENTER AND THERE'S NO

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.988
IN BETWEEN. SO IF YOU CAN TALK

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.757
ABOUT A BROADER ABOVE AND BEYOND

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:25.061
THESE. KIND OF PROJECTS IN YOUR

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:27.297
THOUGHTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:27.964
THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO THAT'S -

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.966
RIGHT AND AS YOU AND I ARE BOTH

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:32.268
FROM A RURAL PART OF THE STATE

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:33.736
AND AT PROBABLY IN DIFFERENT

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:35.438
PARTS OF OUR LIVES. HAD PERSONAL

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:37.340
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AND SO I AM

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:39.575
VERY VERY PERSONALLY. AS

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:41.711
SENSITIVE AND AWARE TO THE

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:43.379
CHALLENGES OF RURAL CALIFORNIA

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:45.481
BUT IT ALSO EXTENDS TO URBAN

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:47.450
PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE. PEOPLE

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:50.520
DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO TO

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:53.923
RECYCLING CENTERS- WHERE AT THE

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.358
PRICE OF REAL ESTATE IS REALLY

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:56.893
HÌNH SAID THE CHALLENGES ARE A

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.394
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN

00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.396
DIFFERENT. LOCATIONS UT GETTING

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:03.733
A PERMANENT SOLUTION- FOR THOSE

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.336
REGIONS THAT MAY NOT BRING IN.

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.271
THE NUMBER OF BEVERAGE

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.707
CONTAINERS TO REALLY MEET THE

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:13.843
REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATUTE AND

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.812
- BE A FREE STANDING- MONEY

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:18.047
MAKING BUSINESS. IS A HUGE

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:19.983
CHALLENGE AND I THINK. HE'S BEEN

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:21.884
PART OF WHAT WE SEE. IN RURAL

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.686
PARTS OF THE STATE IS THEY'RE

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:25.121
NOT BRINGING IN ENOUGH BEVERAGE

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.790
CONTAINERS. TO MAKE THE BUSINESS

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:30.460
MAKE SENSE AND I THINK. AS YOU

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:32.028
KNOW TRANSPORTATION COSTS TO

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:34.564
PROCESSING CENTERS THE COST OF

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.465
REAL ESTATE ACOSTA PERMITTING

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:39.469
THE COST OF. AS HAVING AND-

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:42.071
EMPLOYEES THERE. THE FOR HOURS

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.272
WHERE THEY'RE NOT BRINGING IN

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.741
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE ALL

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.677
THINGS. THAT IF WE COULD IMPART

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:48.845
SOME FLEXIBILITY INTO THE

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:52.181
SYSTEM. WOULD AG. BE MAKE IT

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:54.417
MORE LIKELY THAT THESE-

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.352
RECYCLING CENTERS COULD SIXTEEN

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.588
IN PLACES LIKE HUMBOLDT COUNTY

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:01.224
LIKE MENDOCINO COUNTY- YOU

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:03.526
COUNTY. ALPINE COUNTY SOME OF

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.561
THE COUNTIES THAT WE KNOW ARE

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:08.965
CONSTANTLY STRUGGLING- AND AB

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:10.166
THIRTEEN ELEVEN LAST YEAR WE ARE

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:11.434
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.769
IMPLEMENTING THE COMPONENTS OF

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.203
AB THIRTEEN ELEVEN SEVERAL OF

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.671
WHICH WILL REQUIRE US TO DOT.

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:16.906
REGULATIONS BUT WE ARE

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:18.274
ATTEMPTING TO FAST TRACK THOSE

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:19.909
REGULATIONS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:25.014
THE FLEXIBILITY AND- HOURS. OF

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.149
OPERATION- AT THE FLOOD. AND

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:28.684
HAVE AND- TO BRING AND BACKDROP

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:31.320
SO. IMPARTING SOME OF THIS

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:34.524
FLEXIBILITY TO RECYCLING CENTERS

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.092
I IN PARTS OF OUR STATE THAT ARE

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.061
NOT GOING TO SEE THE CONSISTENCY

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:40.229
OF HIGH VOLUME WILL HOPEFULLY

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:43.199
ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A BUSINESS

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:47.970
MODEL THAT MAKES SENSE. THANK

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.439
YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:51.707
THINK THAT- IN. AS YOU'RE

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:53.476
DISCUSSING- CENTER DOLLY I JUST

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.278
MADE A COMMENT AND I AGREE I

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.814
THINK YOU KNOW GAME. HAVING ONE

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.883
IS. OKAY BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.086
TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BECOME-

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.088
DIVERSIFIED IN LOCATIONS

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:07.023
ESPECIALLY I MEAN WHETHER IT'S

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.991
URBAN OR RURAL I THINK THAT IS

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.860
THE GOAL AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:12.495
WORDS INTO OUR CHAIRS MOUTH. I

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.863
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE ITEMS

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:16.265
THAT HE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:17.433
IS TO MAKE IT AS CONVENIENT AS

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.202
POSSIBLE AND IF YOU'RE IN

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:20.369
TRINITY COUNTY YOU LIVE IN

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:21.737
HAYFORK YOU'RE MOST LIKELY NOT

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:22.872
GOING TO DRIVE. AN HOUR AND

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:23.973
TWENTY MINUTES TO GET TO

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.109
WEAVERVILLE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:27.076
RECYCLING I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.945
THE CHALLENGE AND I AND I KNOW

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.079
THAT YOU'RE A COMMITTED TO THIS

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:32.381
BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT THE

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:34.016
PEACE THAT WE NEED TO E ABLE TO

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.185
GET BACK TO. IT THE LAST THING

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.420
AT MEADOW DR IF IT'S- ALRIGHT

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.554
WITH THE CHAIR LIKE TO TALK

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.256
ABOUT SCRAP- AGAIN I DON'T MEAN

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:42.191
TO KEEP BEATING DRUMS SO- BUT IN

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:44.026
RURAL THERE'S A LOT OF SCRAP

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.362
METAL. ANDTHERE'S BEEN A REAL

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.030
CHALLENGE TO BE ABLE TO REDEEM

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:49.966
THAT RECYCLING CENTERS CAN YOU

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.268
TALK ABOUT STRATEGY ON HOW WE

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:53.803
CAN INCLUDE SCRAP. AT THESE

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.404
RECYCLING CENTERS AND

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:59.408
INCENTIVIZE CONSUMERS. TO BE A

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.744
RETURN THAT AND- I'M SO THANK

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:03.212
YOU QUESTION SENATOR. SO I WILL

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.648
SAY AND THEN. CAN PRO IT'S-

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.049
QUITE INTEREST. IN AND THAT. AT

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.451
YOU KNOW TWENTY PLUS YEARS THAT

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.418
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:10.920
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ONE OF THE

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:13.489
THINGS THAT HAS I THINK. HAD THE

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:16.826
MOST AT THE QUICKEST AND MOST

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:20.463
INTERESTING IMPACT. ON AND ON

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.966
AND- THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THIS

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:26.769
PARTICULAR FIND IS THE PASSAGE

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:29.639
OF AB SEVEN NINETY THREE WHICH

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.240
WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KINGS BELL

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:34.410
ON MINIMUM CONTENTS. AND

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.179
REQUIRING MINIMUM CONTENT TO

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.648
SCRAP VALUES IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:40.383
THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:42.785
HAVE ACTUALLY STABILIZED OVER

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.420
THE LAST TWO YEARS OR WERE

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:44.854
STARTING TO STEVE'S

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:47.823
DESTABILIZATION AND I THINK THAT

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.825
IS BECAUSE- LEGISLATION LIKE

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:51.127
SEVEN NINETY THREE THAT NOW

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.595
REQUIRES A MINIMUM. RECYCLED

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:56.098
CONTENT- I'LL AND IT PROVIDES

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.401
THE MARKET THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.469
THAT THE CERTAINTY OF THAT

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:02.004
PARTICULAR SUPPLY AND THE

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:04.373
CERTAINTY THAT IT WILL BE NEEDED

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.508
FOR THE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:09.946
ARE BEING- BEING- AB RETURNED

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:12.148
RECYCLED AND RE MANUFACTURED. I

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.783
THINK ON THE BIGGER PICTURE AS

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:15.785
WE ARE LOOKING AT BUILDING OUT

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:18.955
RECYCLING CENTERS AND INCREASING

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:20.523
THE TYPES OF MATERIALS THAT WE

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.258
ARE BRINGING INTO OUR CIRCULAR

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.694
ECONOMY I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.964
AMAZING. IF WE COULD BUILD THAT

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.700
DEVOS IF YOU WELL I'M MORE

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.034
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS I

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.536
KNOW ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS WANTED

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:34.904
TO USE THAT IS JUST AMAZING

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.138
DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS FROM

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.441
REVIEWS TO RECYCLE AND I THINK.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:39.675
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO START

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.277
LOOKING AT MODELS ABOUT HOW WE

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:42.578
CAN PLACE THOSE IN DIFFERENT

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.814
PARTS OF THE STATE SO THAT THAT

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.752
SCRAP IN THOSE- THOSE. THINGS

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:50.953
ARE OUT IN THE WORLD THAT- THAT

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.888
PEOPLE ARE HOW A HARD TIME

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:53.489
RECYCLING OUT WE COULD

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.157
CONSOLIDATE AND BRING BACK AND

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.125
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO. TO

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:58.327
BE OF GREAT BENEFIT I THINK

01:04:58.394 --> 01:04:59.228
CALIFORNIANS BUT THAT WE COULD

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.396
WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.198
SO I'M AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.232
BUILDING OUT THE CIRCULAR

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:05.501
ECONOMY THAT BEAT BEING BEVERAGE

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.336
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. IS

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:08.771
FOUNDATIONAL TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.273
CIRCULAR ECONOMY WAS OUR FIRST

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:12.808
RECYCLING PROGRAM IT IS YOU KNOW

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.910
RESPONSIBLE FOR REALLY SETTING

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.879
THE TONE EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.215
THIS PROGRAM AND REALLY USING IT

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.083
TO BUILD OUT A FULL CIRCULAR

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:23.019
ECONOMY AND GET. TO A PLACE

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.353
WHERE EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHEN

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.588
THEY THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:28.024
THEY USE THINK ABOUT HOW DO I

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.992
MAKE IT IT'S NEXT LIFE NOT HOW

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:32.461
DO I THROW IT AWAY IS. OUR

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.764
FOREMOST GOAL HERE CAP CYCLE.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.065
THANK YOU KNOW THIS CLOSE WITH

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:38.200
THIS IN TURN IT BACK OVER THE

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:40.169
CHAIR AGAIN I THINK- THERE'S

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:41.937
BEEN AN URGENT NEED URBAN AND

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:44.240
RURAL- I JUST TALK ABOUT RULE

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:46.842
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I KNOW- AND-

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.811
GRATEFUL TO BEABLE TO GET. THAT

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.212
THESE RULES SOME OF THESE RULES

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:52.515
CENTERS RE OPENED- THERE IS BEEN

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.116
A PENT UP DEMAND IN NASA

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:55.951
TRACTORS IN THE BEGINNING. THERE

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:57.453
IS LITERALLY A TO OUR QUEUE. TO

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.056
GET IN ONCE THE ARCADA FACILITY

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:03.459
OPENED- AND- I DO WANT TO SAY-

01:06:03.526 --> 01:06:04.827
THE TRACTOR WAS INTIMATELY

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.095
INVOLVED WITH THAT AND JUST WANT

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.797
TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR MOVING

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:09.498
THAT FORWARD BECAUSE THAT. I

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:11.100
WON'T SWEAR BUT IT WAS A BIT OF

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.102
A SHOW GETTING TO WHERE WE WERE.

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:17.206

ADULTS YOU- COLLECT THAT WE

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:42.858

OTHERWISE BEEN ABLE TO- COLLECT-

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.230

ACHIEVED WHAT WAS AGAIN I

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:55.938
BELIEVE RIGHTLY THERE IS AN

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:59.007
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR- THEIR

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.309
REDEMPTION VALUE BACK OUT OF

THEIR BEVERAGE CONTAINER. TO

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.212
THIS DEPARTMENT HAVE A NUMBER I

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:05.314
KNOW. AND I'M GOING BACK TO

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.217
MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:11.220
OF THE COVE IT- THERE WAS. I

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:13.756
HEARD REPORTS THAT THAT THE

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:15.924
HAULERS WERE NOT RECYCLING

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:16.892
ANYTHING BECAUSE OF HEALTH

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:18.193
CONCERNS AND THEY WERE JUST

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:20.729
TAKING EVERYTHING OFF TO THE-

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.998
THE LANDFILL I DON'T I DON'T I

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.233
CAN'T CONFIRM WHETHER THAT'S

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:26.034
TRUE OR NOT BUT WOULDN'T THAT.

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:27.569
AFFECT THE RECYCLING RATE IF

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:29.138
THEY THINGS JUST WENT TO

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.639
REGRETTABLY TO THE LANDFILL

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:35.611
ADMITTEDLY FOR HEALTH REASONS.

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:36.311
DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON THAT.

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:39.214
WELL SENATOR AT. WE'D THAT IS

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:40.549
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.151
HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT NOT FROM

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:44.186
CALLERS NOT FROM RECYCLERS SO I

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.454
WOULD BE CURIOUS FOR THAT'S

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:48.023
COMING AND I WOULD SAY- THAT WE

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.525

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.059

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.461
DOING AT THAT AT RIGHT NOW

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:56.365
WHICH- WHICH WILL COME OUT. I

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.634
BELIEVE. LATER THIS YEAR- WE ARE

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.269
NOT SEEING RECYCLABLE BEVERAGE

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:02.704

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.740
NUMBER OF RECYCLED FULL COVERAGE

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:06.175
CONTAINERS SHOWING UP IN

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:08.076
LANDFILLS WHICH IS WHY WE THINK

GOOD POINT IT. THERE SHOULD BE.

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:00.469
REPORTING IN THIS THERE'S A LOT

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:03.238

THEN HOW WHAT THE FACTS ARE-

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:11.513
BECAUSE THIS ONE TIME MONIES AND

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.081
IN SOME THE LIFESPAN TO SOME OF

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:14.916
THESE PROJECTS OR- CREDITORS

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:18.386
LIKE FORTY WEEKS. SO I THINK THE

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.355
IT WOULD BE BEHOOVE THE-

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:21.389
COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:23.758

01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:25.293
REQUIREMENT- PUT IN THIS. IT

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.863
GOES FORWARD. OKAY LET'S LET'S

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.465
PICK UP ON THE- SEVENTY MILLION

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.601
TO ESTABLISH THE- MOBILE

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.436
RECYCLING AND RURAL OR

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:36.938
UNDERSERVED- WE DO HAVE A

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:39.441
CURRENT PILOT PROGRAMS FOR. UP

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:41.810
BOB MOBILE RECYCLING. WHAT WE

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:44.479
LEARNED FROM THOSE PROGRAMS- AT

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:48.049
CAL RECYCLE AND- HOW DO YOU SEE

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:49.718
THEM BEING PLACED INTO THESE

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:52.087
FOUR DIFFERENT REGIONS MORE.

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:54.956
LESSONS LEARNED. SO I THINK THAT

01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:57.225
WAS A REALLY EXCELLENT I'M POINT

01:19:57.292 --> 01:20:00.095
THAT ROSTER BROUGHT UP AND OUR

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:03.165
MOBILE RECYCLER IN AND IN CULVER

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:07.235
CITY HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR.

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:08.737
THEY'RE ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:11.239
LONGER AND LOCAL RECYCLERS I

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.975
THINK CENTS TWENTY TWENTY AND SO

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:16.278
FAR THEY ARE CURRENTLY SERVING

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:23.552
INTO. A FOLDER CITY- AND- NUMBER

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:24.753
OF CONTAINERS THAT THEY WERE

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:26.254
DEEMED THROUGH THE MOBILE

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:29.090
RECYCLING IS ROUGHLY FOUR AND A

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:32.060
HALF MILLION- AYE CONTAINERS AYE

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:35.397
RECYCLED AYE BETWEEN NOVEMBER

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:36.665
TWENTY TWENTY AND MARCH TWENTY

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:39.434
TWENTY TWO. I'M SO I THINK IF

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.902
THE QUESTION IS THAT THIS IS

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:42.837
GOING TO INCREASE OUR RECYCLING

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:45.340
RATE SIGNIFICANTLY I DON'T KNOW

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:46.808
THAT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:48.877
SATISFIED WITH THE MOBILE

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:51.646
RECYCLING OR ANY OF THESE OTHER

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:53.415
SYSTEMS- I THAT WE ARE TESTING

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.250
IN SOME OF OUR RECYCLING CENTERS

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:56.985
IF THE QUESTION IS DID WE

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.187
INCREASE ACCESS AND DO THE

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:02.090
CONSUMERS- AND PEOPLE OF THAT

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:03.758
LOCATION FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:06.027
GREATER ACCESS. I THINK THAT YOU

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:08.196
WOULD GET A SIGNIFICANT ANSWER

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:09.631
OF THE PEOPLE OF CULVER CITY

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.533
HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THIS

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.934
PARTICULAR SYSTEM AND ARE

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:16.304
LOOKING TO EXPAND SO I THINK YOU

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:17.973
KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.975
WORTH NOTING IN TERMS AND WE ALL

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.177
KNOW THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.078
TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD VERY

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:25.380
SIGNIFICANT DECREASES. IN THE

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:27.849
NUMBER OF RECYCLING CENTERS IN

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:31.253
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- AND

01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:33.455
THAT THAT THAT QUESTION CALLS

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.823
INTO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:37.192
HAVE PROVIDED ADEQUATE ACCESS TO

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:39.461
THIS PROGRAM BUT WHAT DID HAPPEN

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.563
IS EACH TIME WE LOST HUNDREDS OF

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:43.531
RECYCLING CENTERS OUR RECYCLING

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:45.734
RATE ONLY WENT DOWN ONE TO THREE

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.136
PERCENT. SO IT'S IN THESE AREAS

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.971
WERE NOT NECESSARILY UP

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:52.340
RECYCLING HUGE QUANTITIES IT IS

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.442
REALLY JUST ENSURING OVERALL

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:58.280
ACCESS TO A PROGRAM THAT EVERY

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.147
CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO. RIGHT

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:01.049
OKAY I MEAN BECAUSE NO CULVER

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:03.652
CITY IS A DENSE POPULATION URBAN

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:06.187
AREA AND YOUR PREVIOUS REMARKS

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:07.822
ABOUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:09.024
THE RURAL AREAS THE

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.525
TRANSPORTATION COSTS THAT THAT

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.160
THAT HAS TO GO IN AND THE

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:14.796
SCARCITY. OF THE SCARCITY SO I'M

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:16.831
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. ARE

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:19.401
THERE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE PILOT

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:20.335
PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE RUNNING

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:22.437
RIGHT NOW THAT WILL DO BEST

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:26.308
PRACTICES OR- IS THIS ENTIRELY.

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:28.109
YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PROGRAM FROM

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:30.512
ALL THE CURRENT MOBILE PROGRAM

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.447
SAID THAT WE HAD. THAT IS A

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:33.915
REALLY GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU

CENTER I WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:36.885
TREATING THIS OR WE WOULD

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:38.086
PROPOSE TREATING THEM.

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:40.889
DIFFERENTLY THAN B. FROM THE

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:42.657
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE RUNNING

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:44.192
AT THAT ARE BEING RUN BY THE

01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:45.493
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.263
STATE THIS IS- OF A FIRST FOR

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.265
CALIFORNIA WOULD THAT WE WOULD

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.800
BE CONTRACTING DIRECTLY. WITH

01:22:51.866 --> 01:22:55.403
RECYCLING AND ENTITIES- AND WHAT

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.605
WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON IS

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:59.908
HELPING BUILD OUT AND STATE AND

LOCAL CONSERVATION CORES OUT

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:05.613
REALLY BUILDING OUT A DEMAND FOR

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.884
THIS KIND OF- AT OPPORTUNITY IN

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:11.252
THESE REGIONS BUT WE WANT TO

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:13.054
REALLY THE REASON WE'RE TALKING

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:15.623
ABOUT DOING FOUR. SEPARATE

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.959

THE ENTIRETY OF NORTHERN

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:33.708
CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO LOOK VERY

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.410
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE NEED TO

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:38.279
DO FOR SANTA MONICA OR ADD YOU

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.148
KNOW USING THE EXAMPLE OF CULVER

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:41.850
CITY AND SO WHAT WE REALLY WANT

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:44.152
TO DO IS TAKE WHAT WE KNOW AT

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:46.154
THE STATE LEVEL. ABOUT WHAT IS

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:47.422
WORKING FROM THE PILOT PROJECTS

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:49.691
BUT JUST IN GENERAL AND DEPLOYS

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:52.961
SOME SOME IDEAS AROUND AND IT IN

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:54.028

ENTIRETY OF CALIFORNIA PROTECTED

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:13.314
THAT SOUNDS GOOD IT JUST IT

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:14.816
CREATES SOME IT DOESN'T SEEM

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:15.817
CONGRUENT WITH THE OTHER LINE

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.352

BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:59.194
SOMETHING GOES RIGHT AND ONE OF

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.628
THESE FOUR REGIONS. JUST A

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:03.498
THOUGHT CENTER DOLLY HAS A

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:05.133
QUESTION AGAIN. OKAY DO THEY

HAVE THE FLEET REQUIRED FOR THE

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:08.670
MOBILE SERVICES LIKE LIKE HOW

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:11.372
MUCH- OF THIS WOULD GO TOWARDS

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:12.907
ACQUIRING NEW VEHICLES AND

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.275
UPGRADING EQUIPMENT TO MEET THE

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:16.511
MOBILE SOURCE. AND HOW MUCH WILL

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:18.112
IT IMPACT RECYCLING RATES- CARDS

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.881
MOBILE SORT A SOURCE

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:24.552
REQUIREMENTS. AND STILL ACTUALLY

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.688
AT AS SENATOR BECAUSE WE WOULD

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:28.723
BE CONTACTING FOR THIS WE WOULD

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.225
NOT BE USING ANY OF THESE FUNDS

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.926
TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE. ANY

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:35.129
VEHICLES WE ARE LOOKING TO-

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:39.434
CONTRACT. AND THE CONTRACTORS

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:40.101
ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO MEET

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:43.271
THE EMISSION STANDARDS IN MOBILE

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:48.243
SOURCE IMPACTS OF CARP. ANY

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.745
OTHER MEMBER OF AND INDUSTRY AND

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:53.848
PLATE- THEY WOULD HAVE TO MEET

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:57.385
ALL CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:59.621
. BUT WE ARE NOT ADDING ANY

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:05.426
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS HERE. SO

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:06.895
ON THE SEVENTY MILLION FOR THE

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.963
RURAL AREAS ARE THOSE LOANS OR

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.199
GRANTS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:15.270
GIVEN OUT. FOR THE MOBILE THE

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:17.906
MOBILE RECYCLING CORRECT THOSE

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.841
ARE CONTRACTS OKAY THOSE

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:21.943
CONTRACTS AND YOU YOU TO

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.812
SUBMISSION FOR REGIONS SHOULD WE

MOM IS THAT COULD BE FOR

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:28.216
CONTRACTS OR IS THERE GOING TO

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.585
BE SUBCONTRACTS WITHIN A REGION

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:32.186
IN CALIFORNIA. STILL PART OF THE

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:34.722
REASON I KNOW- RUSS'S YEARLY

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.424
NOTED THAT THAT PART OF THE

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:37.125
REASON THAT WE DIDN'T GO INTO

01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:39.460
THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL ON THIS

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:40.595
PARTICULAR PROVISION ALL OF THE

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:43.498
P. C. P. IS THAT WE WANT TO DO A

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:44.699
PUBLIC PROCESS THAT INCLUDES

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:48.169
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- RECYCLERS-

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:49.837
AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:53.174
DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO- CHIU

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:54.576
AND MAYBE IT ENDS UP BEING FIVE

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:57.412
REGIONS. THAT IN MY MIND I CAN

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:59.714
KIND OF SEE THAT THE FOR BUT THE

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:02.350
BEST WAY TO DEVISE A SYSTEM THAT

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:05.286
WORKS FOR ALL OF THE RURAL AREAS

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:06.020
OF THE STATE SO WE REALLY WANT

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:07.255
TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:08.856
STAKEHOLDERS AND DEVISE A SYSTEM

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:11.359
THAT THAT WORKS. WHAT ACT THAT

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:13.027
NOW WHAT FACTORS WITH CAL

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.729
RECYCLE BE USING IN THE

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:19.067
TERMINATING THE FUNDING. FOR

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:20.168
THESE RECIPIENTS OR- HELLO. THE

01:27:20.234 --> 01:27:22.270
PRIORITIES FOR THE RECIPIENTS.

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:25.006
WELL THE PERSON FOR MOST- FACTOR

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:27.942
AND SENATOR AS WE DISCUSSED IS

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:30.678
HOW IS THIS GOING TO PRODUCE-

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:33.214
NOTICEABLE INCREASES IN- AND

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:35.316
MEANINGFUL. AND INCREASES IN

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:39.220
ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM- OR AS

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:41.022
WORLD CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY IN

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:44.225
THOSE RECYCLING DESERT-AND LIKE

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:45.960
I SAID WE WOULD LIKE TO SET UP A

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:48.129
PUBLIC PROCESS BY WHICH WE WOULD

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:50.031
DEVELOP A CONTRACTING CRITERIA.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.499
WHERE WE WOULD THEN PUT THE

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:54.302
CONTRACT OUT TO BID- BUT ALSO

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:56.471
GIVING CREDIT BUT BY ALSO GIVING

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:57.839
PRIORITY TO OUR CONSERVATION

01:27:57.905 --> 01:28:01.042
FOREST- AND THE STATE COURT. I'M

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:03.811
ON THE LET'S MOVE TO THE FIFTEEN

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:05.246
HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE REVERSE

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:06.347
VENDING MACHINES IN PARTICULAR

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:08.149
THE FIFTY MILLION FOR HIGH

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:11.019
SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. WHY NOT.

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:12.787
WHY COLLEGES AND HIGH SCHOOLS

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:14.455
AND WHY NOT YOU KNOW PUBLIC

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:17.058
FORMS THAT HAVE A BETTER. OF

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.961
BROADER SPECTRUM OF- OF FOLKS

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:21.629
LIKE A LIBRARY OR COMMUNITY

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.197
CENTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:25.833
BECAUSE OF THE- ANTICIPATED.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.902
CHALLENGES YOU MAY HAVE ON GOING

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:31.806
ON TO A- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SITE.

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.408
IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU WELL IF WE

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:37.211
DID NOT PROPOSED. ELEMENTARY

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:39.013
SCHOOL. BUT I THAT YOU THAT

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.015
BECAUSE I IT WAS A CONVERSATION

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.250
THAT I HAD WITH YOU WHERE- AND

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:44.052
LIBRARIES WAS BROUGHT UP I DON'T

01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:45.887
I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT I THINK WE

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.155
TALKED ABOUT LIBRARIES. AND I

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.222
THINK THAT'S A GREAT ADDITION TO

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:50.258
THIS WHAT THE REAL IDEA THOUGH

01:28:50.324 --> 01:28:51.059
BEHIND UNIVERSITIES AND HIGH

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:53.828
SCHOOLS AS THAT BECAUSE- THEY

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:55.963
HAVE- TYPICALLY HAVE BENDING

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:57.965
MACHINES ON SITE WOULDN'T IT BE

01:28:58.032 --> 01:29:00.368
GREAT. I F. AS A UNIVERSITY

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:02.503
STUDENT OR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:04.372
AFTER YOU FINISHED YOUR BOTTLE

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:06.007
OF WATER IF YOU COULD PUT IT

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:07.875
DIRECTLY INTO YOUR OVERSPENDING

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:10.111
MACHINE AND THAT THAT MONEY WENT

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.914
INTO. A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.349
THAT YOU SET UP OR DAY- HIGH

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:17.218
SCHOOL COULD BE DOING SOME FORM

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:19.020
OF CHARITY DRIVE AND PEOPLE

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:21.122
COULD BE BRINGING. THEIR BOTTLES

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.657
AND CANS FROM HOME AND DOING

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.125
CHARITY THERE SO WHAT WE WERE

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.561
REALLY DOING IS YOU KNOW ART THE

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.029
YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:30.531
REALLY GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:32.333
LEAD THIS NATION AND EVERYTHING.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.069
BUT I REALLY IN THIS CASE THEY

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:37.672
ARE VERY AT ENVIRONMENTALLY.

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:40.241
AWARE AND WHY NOT BUILD ON THAT

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:43.978
BY PROVIDING THEM THE TECHNOLOGY

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:46.681
AT TO BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM SO

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:48.416
WASN'T REALLY INTENDED TO HAVE

01:29:48.483 --> 01:29:50.485
PEOPLE WALKING ONTO UNIVERSITY

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:51.419
CAMPUSES ARE HIGH SCHOOL

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:53.855
CAMPUSES IT WAS REALLY INTENDED

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:55.356
FOR THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:57.325
NORMALLY ON THOSE FACILITY FEEL

01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:59.660
LIKE THOSE BUT I LOVE THE IDEA.

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.062
OF EXPANDING THAT TO OTHER

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:04.265
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS LIKE- LIKE

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:06.067
LIBRARIES SO THE INTENDED

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:08.169
REDEEMER WILL BE LIKE ON A

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.537
COLLEGE CAMPUS JUST A COLLEGE

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:14.742
STUDENT THERE'S. NO OTHER

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:17.779
THERE'S NO OTHER. DO EIGHT.

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:20.348
RIGHT RIGHT I MEAN IF YOU THINK

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:22.416
I LIKE A I THINKING AS I. AND

01:30:22.483 --> 01:30:25.086
CITY COLLEGE. HOW MANY. OF RE

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:26.254
COMING AND GOING FROM A CITY

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.089
COLLEGE CAMPUS EVERY DAY AND

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:31.993
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THEY HAD

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:33.094
ACCESS TO THIS TECHNOLOGY RIGHT

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:36.164
THERE. AGAIN THE IDEA OF

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.565
EXPANDING IT TO OTHER PUBLIC

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:39.033
FACILITIES YOU HAVE FIFTY

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.202
MILLION FOR SUPERMARKETS- HOW

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:43.037
DID YOU ARRIVE AT THAT FIGURE

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.405
FOR SUPPORT THAT'S A THOUSAND

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:45.606
MACHINES FOR ALL THE

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:46.641
SUPERMARKETS IN THESE

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.976
UNDERSERVED. RURAL URBAN AND

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:52.213
SUBURBAN AREAS. SENATOR AS WE

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.115
WORK I'M WORKING THROUGH THE

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:57.618
DISCUSSIONS- WITH OUR- NOW

01:30:57.685 --> 01:31:00.354
PARTNER OVER AT CVS WE WERE

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.923
LOOKING AT ALL OF THE PARTS OF

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:04.258
THE STATE THAT ARE. NOT

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:06.828
ADEQUATELY SERVED AND LOOKING AT

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:09.530
ALL OF THEIR PARTICULAR SITE

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:10.932
BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:11.999
THEIR SETTLEMENT BUT WE STARTED

01:31:12.066 --> 01:31:14.035
LOOKING AT GROCERS ACROSS THE

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.369
STATE AND SO FROM OUR

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:17.905
PERSPECTIVE. AS A YOU KNOW A

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:20.641
THOUSAND- REVERSE VENDING

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:23.077
MACHINES AT GROCERY STORES IS A

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.579
SIGNIFICANT DEPLOYMENT THAT

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:26.514
ALLOWS US TO TRULY TEST WHETHER

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:28.749
THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:31.953
UTILIZED STATEWIDE. BUT ALSO-

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:36.791
NOT SO OF SO MANY THAT WE WOULD.

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:43.364
BE AT A STRUGGLING TO- PROVIDE

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:44.999
OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. I THE

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:46.200
MILLION THE WE HAVE FOR YOU

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:48.636
PROPOSE FOR START UP LOANS I'VE

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:51.005
TALKED TO ADVOCATES AND DAVE

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:53.341
KRIEG THEY'VE SHARED WITH ME A

01:31:53.407 --> 01:31:56.811
MODEL THAT- OF ENTERPRISE WOULD

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:59.513
NEED SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.315
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH.

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:03.317

ONE OF THESE CHALLENGED AREAS

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.694
TO. BUY THE EQUIPMENT SERVICE A

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:15.863
PROCESSOR AND GET AND GET THE

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:19.367

COMMUNITY THAT'S THERE- AND YOU

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:25.406
KNOW I. SORT OF. LIVE THE DREAM

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:27.775
OF BEING A RECYCLER PROCESSOR IN

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:31.879
THIS AREA- YOU GUYS. IT APPEARS

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:34.181
TO BE THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS AS

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:36.050
PROPOSED IN THE B. C. P. IS. A

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.618
RATHER LOW NUMBER AND IT'S A

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:41.222
LOAN FOR PARTICIPATION- COMPARED

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:43.024
TO THE IN THE HUNDRED MILLION TO

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:44.859
THAT REACHED RICHARD. HOW DID

OF RESULTS DO YOU EXPECT. WITH

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:51.565
THAT WITH THAT TYPE OF MONEY.

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:53.134
THE REASON THAT WE STRUCTURED

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.702
THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF THE

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:56.304
PROPOSAL THE WAY THAT WE DID

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.506
SENATOR WHAT IS THAT WILL WIND

01:32:58.572 --> 01:33:01.275
IT IS LOANS BECAUSE WE WANT TO

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:03.377
ENSURE THAT THE EXPENDITURE OF

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:06.414
THE FUNDS. IS AT IT PROCREATE

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.249
EXPENDITURE AND STATE DOLLARS

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:10.618
AND SO IT IS A FORGIVABLE LOAN

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:13.020
AS IT STRUCTURED BUT IT IS ALSO

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:15.623
INTENDED TO BE A START UP COST

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:17.758
AND NOT BE AN ONGOING

01:33:17.825 --> 01:33:19.694
SENSITISATION OF THE RECYCLING

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.462
CENTER. ONE OF THAT I THINK

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.130
CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE NOTING

01:33:23.197 --> 01:33:24.432
HERE IS THAT IT WOULD BE VERY

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:26.200
SIGNIFICANT TO HOW THEY HAVE A

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:29.437
RECYCLING CENTER. AND AT

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:31.405
SIGNIFICANT COST TO HAVE A

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:33.774
RECYCLING CENTER AT SUBSIDIZED

01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:35.776
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS AND

01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:37.778
REGIONS OF THE STATE AND AS

01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:39.246
THESE ARE ONE TIME FUNDS WE

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:40.715
CAN'T CONTINUE THE

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:43.951
SUBSIDIZATION. OVER THE LIFE OF

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:45.519
THE RECYCLING CENTER AND SO WE

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:47.355
DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SYSTEM

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.857
THAT CAN'T SUSTAIN ITSELF SO THE

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:52.793
INTENTION HERE WAS TO PROVIDE. A

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.528
START UP COSTS AND FOR THOSE

01:33:54.595 --> 01:33:56.130
RECYCLERS WHO HAD A BUSINESS

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:57.932
MODEL WHERE THE WHAT THEY REALLY

01:33:57.999 --> 01:33:59.233
TRULY NEEDED WAS FOR. START UP

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:01.135
COSTS WE WOULD HELP SUBSIDIZE

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.737
THE START UP COSTS BUT THAT THE

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:04.705
BUSINESS MODEL INTO ITSELF WOULD

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:07.742
HAVE TO WORK- I'VE ITS EVENTS EL

01:34:07.808 --> 01:34:10.244
MOMENTO VENTILATION SO. I'M AND

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:11.812
THEN AGAIN IF THEY ARE LOANS SO

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:14.315
THAT WE HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:16.050
RECRUIT THOSE DOLLARS IF THEY

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:18.386
ARE NOT APPROPRIATELY EXPENDED.

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:19.553
AND WHEN YOU SEE APPROPRIATELY

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.856
EXPENDED THE MAIN I'VE SUGGESTED

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:23.624
THAT THEY STAY IN BUSINESS FOR

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:28.062
THREE YEARS. SO THAT THEY THEY

01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:30.765
HAVE SOME. ACCRUED TO- THE

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.233
KICKED THE COMMUNITY AND THEN

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:35.169
GIVING THEM THIS FORGIVABLE LOAN

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:36.470
TO STAY IN BUSINESS WILL BE

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:38.339
BUILT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE DO YOU

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:40.508
HAVE HAVE YOU TALKED IT. ACTUAL

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:43.244
INVESTORS OR INVESTORS THAT

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:44.412
WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT MODEL OR

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:45.579
DIFFERENT. NO THAT'S VERY

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:47.415
CONSISTENT SENATOR WENT WELL

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:49.450
WHAT THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT ALSO-

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:52.453
YOU KNOW I WOULD ADD TO THAT-

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.722
APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AS THOSE

01:34:54.789 --> 01:34:56.657
FACILITIES WOULD NEED TO BE DONE

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:58.092
TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:59.326
OPERATING CONSISTENT WITH OFF

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:02.029
OKAY LAST QUESTION FOR ME- AT

01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:04.732
THE END OF A- PAGE SEVENTEEN OF

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:06.634
OUR STAFF REPORT. WE TALK ABOUT

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:08.002
THE LIMITATIONS OF THE BOTTLE

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:10.738
BILL AND CAL RECYCLE PUBLISHED

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:14.842
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- THE

LIMITED ABILITIES XCERRA WE

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:21.882
TALKED ABOUT. IMPROVING

01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:23.918
RECYCLING AND MANUFACTURING

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.886
SHARING RESPONSIBILITIES THAT'S

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:27.254
A GOOD AND INTERESTING THOUGHT

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:29.857
AND ENHANCING ADAPT ADAPTABILITY

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:33.627
AND SUSTAINABILITY IN BETWEEN

01:35:33.694 --> 01:35:34.495
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TODAY WE

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:38.065
HAD. REPLANTED CLOSING ITS TWO

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:40.167
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR.

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:42.837
LOCATIONS HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:46.841
RESPOND TO THE TWO THOUSAND

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:48.976
SEVENTEEN CAL. RECYCLED

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:52.113
PUBLICATION. WELL I THINK YOU

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:53.948
KNOW I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:55.015
OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:57.318
SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT HAD

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:59.019
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WHERE THE

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.821
LEGISLATURE HAS INCORPORATED

01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:02.323
SOME OF THE CONCEPTS TO THE

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:06.794
TWENTY SEVENTEEN- WHITE PAPER

01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:08.562
THAT THE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT AT

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:11.298
THAT JUNCTURE. I HAVEN'T SITTING

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:14.101
HERE SOMEPLACE WHAT PAPER AND SO

01:36:14.168 --> 01:36:16.871
I WOULD SAY FIRST AND FOREMOST I

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:19.440
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHITE PAPER

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:21.242
RECOMMENDED- DOING SOME PILOT

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:23.511
PROJECTS TO TEST SOME MORE

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:25.246
FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS SO AS YOU AND

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:27.014
AS WE DISCUSSED AND AS YOU ALL

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:28.482
WELL KNOW WE ARE DOING THAT

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:30.784
RIGHT NOW IS A STATE AND ACROSS

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:31.218
MANY DIFFERENT LOCAL

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:33.521
JURISDICTIONS- OVERALL

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:35.990
SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN THE SYSTEM

01:36:36.056 --> 01:36:38.325
AND I THINK YOU WILL ALSO KNOW

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:39.793
IN THE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.295
WHITE PAPER THERE ARE SOME

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:43.430
STATUTORY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:49.570
AT THAT- THAT TO BE AT WHAT YOU

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:50.905
WERE MADE AS IN ADDITION TO. THE

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:54.141
WERE THAT WE IN TWENTY TWENTY AB

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:56.777
PURSUANT TO AB AT FIFTY FOUR AND

01:36:56.844 --> 01:36:58.212
I THINK THE OVERALL THEME OF

01:36:58.279 --> 01:37:00.080
THOSE VIEWS THE WHITE PAPER AND

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.783
THE AB FIFTY FOUR REPORT IS THAT

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:05.186
THERE ARE SOME- CHANGES THAT

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:07.354
SHOULD BE MADE TO THIS PROGRAM

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:10.057
TO PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY I

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:11.625
TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:14.028
AS THE NEEDS ARE DEMANDED BY THE

01:37:14.094 --> 01:37:15.529
PEOPLE IN THOSE PARTS OF THE

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.164
STATE AND I THINK THIS PROPOSAL

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:18.832
REALLY GOES TO THAT FIGHT

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:21.302
AGAINST MOBILE RECYCLING IN

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:22.570
PARTS OF THE STATE DEPLOYING

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:24.138
MOBILE RECYCLING IN PARTS OF THE

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:26.307
STATE WHERE I HAVE RECYCLING

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:29.643
CENTER. PERHAPS AT AND ISN'T

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:31.011
GOING TO BE PROFITABLE OVER THE

01:37:31.078 --> 01:37:33.214
LONG TERM DEPLOYING RPM'S CHIP

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.916
GROCERS WHO WANT TO BE A PART OF

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:37.885
THE SOLUTION BUT DON'T HAVE THE

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:41.021

SO WITH THE EXISTING DELAYS

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:03.296
BUILT INTO THE STATURE WERE

01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:04.097
CONCERNED THAT THESE PLANTS

01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:05.532
WON'T BE READY UNTIL TWENTY

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.701
TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.036
AND FOR COMMUNITIES ON THE

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:10.904
GROUND THIS COULD MEAN DELAY IN

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:12.072
GETTING RELIEF AND MOVEMENT

01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:14.975
TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY THE APRIL

01:45:15.042 --> 01:45:17.878
FINANCE LETTER NOTED THAT EIGHT

01:45:17.944 --> 01:45:18.445
HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:19.246
MILES COULD GO TRY THIS YEAR

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.914
ALONE AND IF WEARING CONTINUE

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:22.716
DROUGHT THAT NUMBER'S ONLY GOING

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:24.184
TO CONTINUE TO GET WORSE OVER

01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:26.486
TIME- SO WE JUST ARE CONCERNED

01:45:26.553 --> 01:45:29.356
ABOUT WHAT HOW THIS ACTION- TO

01:45:29.423 --> 01:45:30.657
REJECT THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:33.660
TODAY COULD NOT FURTHER DELAY

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:35.395
THAT TIME FRAME AND- ADD MORE

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:37.731
WORKLOAD TO THE TO THE BOARD'S

01:45:37.798 --> 01:45:38.532
PROCESS. AND YOU'RE MINDFUL OF

01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:40.367
THE SIX MILLION THAT WILL BE

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:42.002
ALLOCATED TO COMPLETE THAT THE

01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:44.438
SEQUEL AND THE AT LEAST

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:46.573
PRESENTATION OF A MINIMUM AMOUNT

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.375
OF CHALLENGES THAT THAT THIS

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:51.344
AREA HAS HAD OKAY YEAH YEAH I

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:53.180
THINK THAT THAT THE FUNDING IS

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:54.481
HELPFUL- BUT IT'S JUST THAT

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:56.650
THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:58.351
DONE IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME

01:45:58.418 --> 01:46:00.120
AND AGAIN GIVEN THAT THERE IS A

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:00.787
STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT THEY

01:46:00.854 --> 01:46:02.222
WAIT A YEAR TO START ON GETTING

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:04.091
THAT PLAN READY- WE'RE CONCERNED

01:46:04.157 --> 01:46:05.392
ABOUT HOW THAT THAT ADDS

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:05.992
POTENTIAL DELAY THERE BUT OUR

CERTIFIED PROCESSORS AND

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:56.343
ADDITIONAL METHODS OF COLLECTION

01:46:56.409 --> 01:46:58.845
WE THINK THOSE FUNDS COULD BE

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.747
USED BETTER AND- ARE MORE WELL

01:47:00.814 --> 01:47:02.182
SPENT AND THAT WAY. WE KNOW

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:03.116
THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS WILL

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:04.084
ALSO INCREASE THE STATE

01:47:04.151 --> 01:47:05.185

BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME POLICY

CAL RECYCLE PARTICULARLY THOSE

01:48:06.079 --> 01:48:07.280
PIECES THAT ALLOW THE COURT TO

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:09.282
BUILD ON THEIR EXISTING

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:11.384
EXPERIENCE- IMPLEMENTING SOME OF

01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:13.019
THE PILOT PROGRAMS. SO WE

01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:14.688
APPRECIATE DIRECTOR WAGNER'S

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:16.523
CALL OUT FOR PRIORITIZING CALLS-

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:17.691
COURSE FOR THOSE MOBILE

01:48:17.757 --> 01:48:19.259
RECYCLING PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:21.361
ARE BEING FUNDED- THERE'S AN

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:23.096
OVERLAP BETWEEN SOME OF THE

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:23.997
POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:25.265
DEVELOPED LEGISLATIVELY THE

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:26.666
COURTS ARE IN SUPPORT OF AND

01:48:26.733 --> 01:48:28.435
THIS B. C. P. SO WE APPRECIATE

01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:29.436
THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:48:29.502 --> 01:48:31.304
ADMINISTRATION WORKING TOGETHER

01:48:31.371 --> 01:48:32.939
TO IMPROVE WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS A

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:34.341
SYSTEM THAT'S IN NEED OF. SOME

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:35.008
SOME IMPROVEMENTS AND SOME

01:48:35.075 --> 01:48:37.310
UPDATES- WE WOULD SUGGEST TO

01:48:37.377 --> 01:48:39.012
FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS- THAT AREN'T

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:40.513
SPELLED OUT EXPLICITLY IN THE B.

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:41.982
C. P. SO FIRST THERE ARE

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:43.683
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AS WE

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:45.218
ALL KNOW IN THE MOBILE OF BUY

01:48:45.285 --> 01:48:46.786
BACK CENTRES AND THEN

01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:47.320
INSTALLATION OF AUTOMATIC

01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:48.488
RECYCLING MACHINES WHICH-

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:49.756
DIRECTOR WAGNER ALSO REFERRED TO

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:51.258
AS REVERSE VENDING MACHINES. AND

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:53.059
LOCAL COURTS ARE CALLED OUT IN

01:48:53.126 --> 01:48:54.961
THE B. C. P. BUT THE QUESTION IS

01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:56.129
WHETHER LOCAL COURTS WILL BE

01:48:56.196 --> 01:48:57.797
ABLE TO HELP STAFF THOSE

01:48:57.864 --> 01:48:58.865
ACTIVITIES IN PARTICULAR. WE

01:48:58.932 --> 01:49:00.033
THINK THAT THERE WILL NEED TO BE

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.035
SOME LOCAL CORE ACTIVITIES

01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:03.904
RELATED TO THOSE MOBILE PROGRAMS

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:05.405
THE A. R. M.'S AND OTHER

01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:06.373
TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIGHT BE

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:08.275
DEPLOYED- AND SECOND THERE WILL

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:10.277
LIKELY BE SOME TIME BETWEEN WHEN

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:11.845
THE BUDGET IS ENACTED IN ONE.

01:49:11.912 --> 01:49:13.813
MOBILE PROGRAMS ARE UP AND

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:14.481
RUNNING. WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:16.049
TO INCREASE IN FUNDING TO LOCAL

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:17.817
COURSE IN THE INTERIM TO.

01:49:17.884 --> 01:49:18.852
INCREASE THEIR BEVERAGE

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.420
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAMS

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:21.488
WILL THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:22.923
ARE BEING FOR THOSE MOBILE

01:49:22.989 --> 01:49:26.226
PROGRAMS ARE. BEING DEPLOYED.

01:49:26.293 --> 01:49:30.030
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER

01:49:30.096 --> 01:49:31.031
CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE

01:49:31.097 --> 01:49:32.632
LOUIS BROWN TODAY ON BEHALF THE

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:34.434
CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION.

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:36.002
SPECIFICALLY TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:39.372
CAL RECYCLE- BCP WE DO WANT TO

01:49:39.439 --> 01:49:40.573
THANK THE GOVERNOR. FOR COMING

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.208
FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL TO.

01:49:42.275 --> 01:49:44.577
START TO LOOK AT HOW WE BETTER

01:49:44.644 --> 01:49:47.147
USE- THE AMOUNT THAT IN RESERVE.

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:48.281
SIX HUNDRED MILLION IS A LOT OF

01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:49.649
MONEY. HIGHNESS MONEY THAT

01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:51.484
SHOULD BE USED TO IMPROVE THE

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:53.086
SYSTEM AND IMPROVE PEOPLE'S

01:49:53.153 --> 01:49:55.355
ABILITY TO ACTUALLY RECYCLE. HOW

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:56.923
WE'RE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:59.392
HUNDRED MILLION TO DOUBLE- THE

01:49:59.459 --> 01:50:02.028
CRV- IN MANY OF THOSE AREAS THAT

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.463
ARE UNSERVED- THOSE ARE NOW

01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:05.598
BEING SERVED BY GROCERY STORES.

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:06.900
AND MANY AREAS IN THE RURAL

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:08.535
AREAS OR SMALL GROCERY STORES.

01:50:08.601 --> 01:50:10.370
SIMPLY CAN'T HANDLE HOW WHAT

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:13.473
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO NOW- AND

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.342
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT

01:50:15.408 --> 01:50:17.210
INCREASED. POTENTIAL VOLUME-

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.311
THAT WOULD COME FROM THAT SHORT

01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:19.980
TERM BENEFIT WE DO BELIEVE THAT

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.881
MONEY SHOULD BE. INVESTED IN IN

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:23.917
THE INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE HEARD

01:50:23.984 --> 01:50:25.785
A LOT ABOUT FLEXIBILITY IN THE

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:28.121
CONVERSATION TODAY. YET THE BCP

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:30.223
IS REALLY SILO. WE'RE TALKING

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:32.559
ABOUT CERTAIN MONIES FOR RBM FOR

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:33.626
DROWNED OUT CERTAIN MONIES FOR

01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:35.328
MOBILE WE THINK THOSE DECISIONS

01:50:35.395 --> 01:50:36.930
SHOULD BE MADE ON A LOCAL LEVEL.

01:50:36.997 --> 01:50:38.798
HOW TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE

01:50:38.865 --> 01:50:41.001
BEST OPPORTUNITY. FOR

01:50:41.067 --> 01:50:42.135
CONVENIENCE TO HAPPEN IN THOSE

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:44.070
AREAS. WE ALSO HAD NO DISCUSSION

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:46.139
ABOUT CONVENIENCE- WE'RE STILL

01:50:46.206 --> 01:50:48.375
WORKING OFF OF A HALF A MILE

01:50:48.441 --> 01:50:50.043
RADIUS CIRCLE AROUND A GROCERY

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:52.445
STORE. THAT WAS WRITTEN THIRTY

01:50:52.512 --> 01:50:55.215
YEARS AGO. OF THE 40% OR SO OF

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:57.350
UNSERVED ZONES WE'VE ONLY SEEN A

01:50:57.417 --> 01:51:00.620
REDUCTION IN- RECYCLING BY EIGHT

01:51:00.687 --> 01:51:02.589
TO TEN PERCENT. THOSE UNSERVED

01:51:02.655 --> 01:51:05.425
ZONES WERE BEING OPERATED BY LOW

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:08.762
PERFORMING. RECYCLERS HOW CAN WE

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:10.964
ASSIST LOPER. RECYCLERS TO STAY

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:13.666
IN BUSINESS SO THEY HAVE AN

01:51:13.733 --> 01:51:14.401

RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. BACK THAT

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:18.538
NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:19.706

MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE CAN

01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:46.833
BETTER MOVE THAT MONEY FORWARD.

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:47.834
TO ACTUALLY OBTAIN THOSE GOALS

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:48.802

AGREE THAT MORE DETAILS ARE

01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:08.614
NEEDED AND THE OTHER

01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:10.583

RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:16.589
QUALITY ON TIME PAYMENTS AND

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:18.157
FORGIVABLE LOANS WE THINK THOSE

01:58:18.224 --> 01:58:20.326
ALL MAKES SENSE WORKS BY THE

01:58:20.393 --> 01:58:21.494
POTENTIAL POTENTIAL TO DEPLOY

01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:23.429
REVERSE VENDING MACHINES BUT WE

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:25.031
BELIEVE THE POINT IS MACHINES AT

01:58:25.097 --> 01:58:26.566
HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WILL

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:28.301
REALLY MISS THE MARK AND COULD

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:29.969
INHIBIT USE OF THOSE FACILITIES.

01:58:30.036 --> 01:58:30.503
BY MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL

PUBLIC- MY BACK THE ENVELOPE

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:34.574
CALCULATIONS IS FOR MOST HIGH

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.441
SCHOOL THAT WOULD EQUAL AN

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:37.143
INVESTMENT OF ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:39.412
PER KID AT THE HIGH SCHOOL WHEN

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:40.413
THERE AREN'T ADEQUATE REDEMPTION

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:42.215
OPPORTUNITIES ANOTHER IS THAT

01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:43.983
THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE STRONG

01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:45.585
MISGIVINGS ABOUT DOUBLING THE

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:47.320
REFUND PAID TO CONSUMERS BECAUSE

01:58:47.386 --> 01:58:48.988
IT ONLY LASTS A VERY I'M IN

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:51.557
COULD BE EXACT BY THE TIME WE

01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:52.992
GET REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES OUT

01:58:53.059 --> 01:58:54.794
TO THOSE WHO DON'T HAPPEN TODAY

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:56.529
SO WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:58:56.596 --> 01:58:58.731
MERIT AND AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:58:58.798 --> 01:58:59.298
