OUR FORECAST. THIS ADDITIONAL

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.645
EIGHT MILLION IN REVENUE WOULD

WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:01.927
WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOTTO BE

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:04.096
SUSTAINED IN THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:05.831

FUND REVENUES WILL GROW AT AN

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:44.403
AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF ABOUT 4%

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.471
NO THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:48.540
LOWER THAN THE TWENTY YEAR

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.376

THE END OF THE MULTI YEAR

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.194
PERIOD. A KEY REASON FOR THE

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.996
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.231

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.899
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS IN

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.601
THE AREA THE PERSONAL INCOME

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:20.239
TAX. AND IN PARTICULAR- HOW WE

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:21.206
ESTIMATE THE TRENDS

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:23.208
ENCOMPASSING COMPENSATION FOR

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:26.745
THE HIGH. A HIGH INCOME EARNERS

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:30.182
PARTICULAR. OUR FORECAST

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:31.216
ASSUMES THAT HIGH INCOME

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.918
EARNERS WILL CONTINUE TO

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:35.020
RECEIVE RELATIVELY STRONG WAGE

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.422
AND SALARY GROWTH WHICH IS

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:38.457
CONSISTENT WITH THAT YOU KNOW

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:42.227
RECENT HISTORY. AND YOU KNOW IF

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:43.929
WE WERE TO COMPARE IT TO THE

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.397
ADMINISTRATION'S. IT IT TEARS

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:46.899
THE ADMINISTRATION'S OUR

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:50.335
FORECAST. IS EXPECTING MORE A

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:51.937
GROWING SHARE OF WAGES AND

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:54.006
SALARIES WILL BE GOING TO THE

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:55.774
LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME WAGE

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:58.677
EARNERS SO THAT'S PROBABLY. THE

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:02.714
KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR TWO-

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:06.318
WE'LL TAKE YOUR OUTLOOKS. SO

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:08.454

UNCERTAINTIES. THOUGH I WOULD

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:29.741
JUST NOTE THAT THIS AMOUNT

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.543

RESEARCH FROM THE SAME SOURCE-

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.548
THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN WOULD

THAT WERE IN THE MAY REVISION

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:19.858
BUT GIVEN THE USE OF OUR HIGHER

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.860
REVENUE ESTIMATES. IT WOULD

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:24.162
PROVIDE FOR MORE DEBT PAYMENTS

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:25.697

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:28.033
SPECIFICALLY RELATIVE TO THE

SO FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THAT'S

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.967
A THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.034

THESE ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS FOR

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:57.589
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WOULD

00:20:57.656 --> 00:21:00.359
ALSO TRANSLATE TO AN INCREASE

INTO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:13.271
RESERVES. THE REST OF IT ABOUT

BETWEEN ONE TIME AND ONGOING-

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.120

WHICH WE HAVE OVER TIME WE HAVE

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:40.165
SAID IS YOU KNOW ADVANTAGEOUS

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.067
BECAUSE IT CREATES A QUESTION

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:42.380
PROJECTED REVENUES FOR THEIR

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:43.982
ONGOING EXPENDITURES RATHER

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:46.117
THAN ONE TIME SPENDING. AND

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:46.985
THIS IS REALLY DUE TO TWO

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:48.820
REASONS BUT- I'M SURE WILL BE

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:50.455
FAMILIAR TO THIS COMMITTEE THE

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:51.923
FIRST BEING THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.326
REVENUE PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.394
TO QUITE A BIT OF VOLATILITY-

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:57.729
AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE HIGHEST

00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:59.097
INCOME EARNERS IN CALIFORNIA

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:01.833
CONTINUE TO PAY- A SIGNIFICANT

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.734
SHARE OF THE STATE'S INCOME

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:05.770
TAX- FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:07.405
EIGHTEEN THE TOP 1% OF EARNERS

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:17.182
ACCOUNTED FOR. ABOUT. 46% OF

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:19.784
ALL- SO INCOME TAX. AND I WAS

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:20.986
JUST OVER A AND SOME THOUSAND.

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:22.020
TAX RETURNS SO CORRECT IN THE

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:23.755
STOCK MARKET NOT EVEN EVERY-

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:24.256
COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:26.191
NEGATIVE IN. TO COME. REVENUES

00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:28.026
AND SECOND I'M OF THE NATURAL.

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:28.693
SOMETHING WE BEEN LEARNING

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.161
QUITE A ABOUT THIS PAST YEAR

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:31.796
IS. THERE'S ALSO JUST A LOT OF

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:32.797
UNCERTAINTY AROUND BUILDING

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.633
THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET COMPARED

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.902
TO OTHER BUDGETS- AND THAT IS

00:25:36.968 --> 00:25:38.270
BECAUSE OF THE INFLUX OF STUFF

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.472
SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING-

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:42.340
THAT'S COMING INTO THE STATES-

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:43.775
AND THE INCOMING ASSOCIATED

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:47.445
ROLES IN REGARDS TO THE USE OF

00:25:47.512 --> 00:25:49.247
THOSE FUNDS- RECENTLY. WE'VE

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:51.016
BEEN WE'VE WE'VE WITNESSED AND

00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:52.984
EXPERIENCED THIS IN THE PAST

00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:55.153
WEEK OR SO- IN REGARDS TO

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.921
FEDERAL GUIDELINES BEING

00:25:55.987 --> 00:25:57.522
RECENTLY RELEASED. FOR THE

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.157
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AFTER OUR

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:02.627
PHONE- AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE-

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:03.495
TO CHILD CARE PROPOSALS THAT

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:04.496
WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAY

00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:06.932
REVISION THAT- USED OUR

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:09.601
FINDINGS- WE LEARNED WILL. WILL

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:10.969
NO LONGER BE ABLE TO USE OUR

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:13.038
FUNDS- AND REQUIRE A GENERAL

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:14.372
FUND BACK FILLED IN THE BUDGET

00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:16.341
YEAR AND BEYOND TO MAINTAIN

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:17.108
THESE PROPOSALS SHOULD BE

00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:17.909
SHOULD BE MAINTAINED HIS

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:19.811
PROPOSALS. AND THAT'S JUST ONE

00:26:19.878 --> 00:26:22.180
EXAMPLE OF- THE UNCERTAINTY

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.381
BEHIND THE PROPOSALS IN THIS

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.717
BUDGET- FOR WHICH GUIDELINES

00:26:25.784 --> 00:26:27.385
WILL BE ISSUED OR HAVE AN ISSUE

00:26:27.452 --> 00:26:28.253
THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THAT

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.389
RIGHT NOW- AND FUTURE YEAH. BY

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:32.457
LINES THEY COULD HAVE

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:34.693
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS EVEN AFTER

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:36.127
A FINAL BUDGET HAS BEEN PASSED

00:26:36.194 --> 00:26:38.563
LATER THIS YEAR- SO THE MATE

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.665
MARRIAGES REVENUE FORECAST YES

00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:41.533
IS MORE CAUTIOUS THAN THE ONLY

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:43.401
OTHERS TO COVER THESE RISKS.

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:44.836
AND THEN BUDGET REVISIONS

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:46.838
BUDGET STRUCTURE LIKEWISE AS

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.039
PROMISED- ON ONE TIME SPENDING

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:49.507
OVER I'M GOING SPENDING WE HAVE

00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:51.710
A NINETY TEN SPLIT. 90% OF THE

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.244
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS ARE BEING

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.980
USED FOR ONE TIME BUT- ONE TIME

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.014
EXPENDITURES VERSUS TEN

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:59.451
PERCENT- I'M VERY TARGETED- I'M

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:02.087
GOING EXPENDITURES. AND THIS IS

00:27:02.153 --> 00:27:03.021
REALLY BECAUSE IT IS MUCH

00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:05.123
EASIER TO PULL BACK OR REDUCE

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.325
ONE TIME EXPENDITURES AND ON

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:10.362
THE FLIP SIDE IT IS- NOT TOO

00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:12.364
EASY OR QUICK TO UNWIND OR CUT

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.698
ON GOING EITHER ENTITLEMENT

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.800
STATUTORY OR CONSTITUTIONAL.

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:17.168
OBLIGATIONS SHOULD THE STATE

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:19.270
NEED TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY. TO

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:20.972
A NEGATIVE FISCAL SCENARIO. SO

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.141
THAT SAID AGAIN- THERE ARE MANY

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:24.509
SURE PARTIES IN BOTH THE

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:26.044
BUDGETS- AND AS THE GOVERNOR

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:28.079
STATED YESTERDAY- THE

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:29.514
ADMINISTRATION IS OPTIMISTIC.

00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:30.715
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

00:27:30.782 --> 00:27:32.317
WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.986
DETAILS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY

00:27:35.053 --> 00:27:37.722
ONCE IN A GENERATION- BUDGET

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:47.198
THAT WILL SUPPORT MILLIONS. OF

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:47.766
CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU VERY

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:50.001
MUCH. THANK YOU MISLI. I HAVE

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:52.604
COUPLE OF. FOR AND FOR. LA- SO

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.673
FIRST. I'M MISLEAD YOU X. THAT

00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.612
THE- ADMINISTRATION- FIVE THIS

00:28:00.678 --> 00:28:02.514
CONCERT ABOUT COST PRESSURE IN

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.983
RELATIONSHIP TO THE

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.553
LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET- BUT MY

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.388
WHAT WILL YOU COULD TELL ME

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:14.325
WHAT IS THE GROWTH FACTOR WHICH

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:16.961
THE WEAPONS USING FOR YOUR OUT

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:20.765
YOUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS. I WAS

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:23.134
SURE I THINK WE ARE BETWEEN ONE

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:29.607
AND 2% COLBY WAIT ON THE LINE

00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:32.010
WHO COULD CONFIRM THAT BUT I

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:32.944
BELIEVE IT IS ABOUT HALF OF

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:36.981
WHAT- THE LA O'S BIRTH ACTORS.

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:40.919
COME ON I THINK THAT'S WHAT I

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:43.988
HAD SEEN IN THE DOCUMENT TO SO

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:44.556
WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:47.959
HAVE KOBE- YEAH IF ONE IN TWO

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:52.597
PERCENT. 4% GROWTH AND- MR PECK

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:55.366
YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE WHAT THE

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:58.203
LA ROSE- WROTE THE ESTIMATE IS

00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:59.971
AND WHETHER THAT WHETHER THAT

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:01.773
IS HIGHER THAN HISTORICAL

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.077
AVERAGE OR LOWER. WELL OURS IS-

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:08.046
MORE IN THE RANGE OF AROUND 4%

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:12.951
IN THE OUT YEARS. AND OUR

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:15.186
IMMEDIATE IF YOU LOOK AT IT

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:17.288
OVER A TWENTY YEAR TIME FRAME

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:18.857
OURS IS ACTUALLY STILL A BIT

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:21.192
LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE ANNUAL

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:24.395
GROWTH RATE ALTHOUGH- YOU KNOW

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:26.564
I WOULD SAY INHERENTLY I MEAN

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.099
THERE'S A RANGE THERE IS NO WAY

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.767
TO PREDICT FOR CERTAIN WHAT THE

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:33.404
REVENUES WILL BE- AND WE TRY TO

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:35.306
DO OUR BEST ESTIMATE THAT COMES

00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:36.574
IN AT ABOUT US FIFTIETH

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.710
PERCENTILE SO REVENUES COULD

00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:40.278
CERTAINLY BE HIGHER OR LOWER

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:42.714
THAN WHAT WE ESTIMATED. AND YOU

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.149
KNOW SO I DON'T I DON'T

00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:46.417
DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING- REALLY

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:50.855
THAT MY- COLLEAGUES AT THE

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:51.489
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID IT'S

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:53.358
JUST- YOU KNOW THIS BUT THE

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:55.160
FACTS ARE. OURS GROWS AT ABOUT

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:56.995
4% IN THE OUT YEARS WHICH IS A

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:59.164
LITTLE BIT SLOWER OVER THE LAST

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.299
TWENTY YEAR PERIOD THAN WHAT.

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:04.869
WE ACTUALLY SAW. THIRTY YEAH I

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:08.506
MEAN DO. NOT TO PUT WORDS IN

00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:11.376
YOUR MOUTH BUT IT WHEN I.

00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:13.378
WHETHER SOMEONE AND CLEARLY

00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:14.646
THESE ARE FORECAST TO THEIR

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:16.014
PROJECTIONS BUT WHETHER WE

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.715
FULLY AGREE WITH THE 4%

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:20.218
PROJECTION. WOULDN'T YOU

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:23.755
DESCRIBE A ONE BETWEEN 122% SIR

00:30:23.821 --> 00:30:26.357
NOT EVEN 2% GROWTH PROJECTION

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:28.960
IS BEING PRETTY CONSERVATIVE

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:29.527
CONSIDERING THE TWENTY YEAR

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:36.334
AVERAGE. YES AND AS I STATED IT

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:37.802
OUR OUR GROWTH RATE IS MORE

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:40.939
CAUTIOUS- AND I WANT TO JUST

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.774
KNOWING THAT I SAW THE GROWTH

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.475
RATE IN THE IN THE AGENDA AND

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:46.544
IT'S NOT BETWEEN ONE POINT SIX.

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:48.913
AND TWO POINT 7% TO BETWEEN ONE

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.051
AND A HALF 23% GROWTH RATE- AND

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:53.885
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S THAT

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:56.120
IMPORTANT. POINT I THINK I'D

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:57.455
LIKE TO MAKE IS NOT SO MUCH

00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:58.856
WHO'S RIGHT IN REGARDS TO THE

00:30:58.923 --> 00:31:01.059
REVENUE BUT JUST THE INCREASED

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:04.295
RISK- AND I'M BANKING ON HIGHER

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.130
REVENUE SHOULD NOT COME AND SO

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:08.266
I THINK THAT IS. PROBABLY THE

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:08.766
MOST IMPORTANT POINT THE

00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:11.502
HIGHLIGHT HERE. AND YET WE KNOW

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:14.339
THAT. CERTAIN THINGS IF WE

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:16.741
DON'T BUY NOT FINDING THEM BY

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:19.143
ADOPTING A MORE. A MORE

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.279
CAUTIOUS AS THEY SAY THEN THERE

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:24.148
ARE. WELL LET'S PUT IT A

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:26.551
DIFFERENT WAY WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:29.621
IMPROVE LIVES NOW WHEREAS THE

00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:31.122
CAUTIOUS APPROACH MIGHT NOT.

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:34.659
AND WHO'S TO SAY WHAT FURTHER

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:38.162
COSTS THAT MAY THEN CAUSE US.

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:39.597
IF BY NOT TAKING THE

00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:42.100
INVESTMENTS NOW SO THAT'S MORE

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.736
MY COMMENTARY BUT LET ME ASK

00:31:44.802 --> 00:31:47.138
YOU A DIFFERENT QUESTION MISLI-

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:49.374
I UNDERSTAND THAT DEPARTMENT OF

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.709
FINANCE HAS SENT A LETTER TO

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.778
COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS.

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:56.347
REQUESTING COST ESTIMATES FOR

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:58.349
THE STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTION

HAVE YOU ALREADY RECEIVED THE

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:02.754
RESPONSES FROM THE COUNTY'S.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.389
YES I'M SURE WE DID ISSUE A

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:06.724
LETTER- LAST WEEK AND DID THE

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:08.926
DEADLINE FOR COUNTY ELECTION

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:13.164
IN REGARDS TO- POTENTIAL COSTS

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:14.465
FOR THE RECALL ELECTION WAS DUE

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:15.967
YESTERDAY SO AT THIS POINT

THE FIFTY EIGHT- STATES THAT

00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:24.542
SORRY COUNTIES RESPONSES- SO.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:25.710
THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE

PEOPLE SEE THE MONEY THAT'S

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:48.090

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:51.126
UNDERSTAND- CLEARLY THAT THERE

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:52.628
WAS MONEY THAT WENT INTO THE

01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:54.797
EDUCATION RAINY DAY FUND TO

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:55.865
MAKE IT OVER FOUR BILLION

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:57.800
DOLLARS THAT THERE'S A PAY DOWN

01:08:57.867 --> 01:09:00.736

THAT THERE IS PAY OFF OF THE

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.775
DEFERRALS AND BILLIONS OF

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.344
DOLLARS AT BOTH THE COMMUNITY

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:11.647
COLLEGE AND THE R. K. THROUGH

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:13.682
TWELVE LEVEL THAT WE RESTORED

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:16.785
FUNDING AT EVERY BRANCH LEVEL

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:18.020
AND THEN HAVE A COST OF LIVING

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:20.723
INCREASE ABOVE IT THAT'S IN THE

01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:22.725

ABOUT THESE GROWTH PROJECTIONS

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.446
BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM THE

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:21.350
CONCERN. THAT PERHAPS OURS

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.419
MIGHT BE TOO AMBITIOUS BUT I

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:24.720
THINK THE EXACT THING THAT YOU

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:26.388
JUST DESCRIBED THE FACT THAT IN

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:28.557
OUR BUDGET STRUCTURE WE ARE

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:29.592

THAT IN IN THE CASE WHICH ONE

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.335
COULD HAPPEN. THAT THE GROWTH

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:41.704
IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECT WE'VE AT

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.872
LEAST CREATED CUSHION. AND LESS

DEBT FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND WE

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:48.243
KNOW THAT DEBT OBVIOUSLY

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.312
INCREASES OUR COSTS OVER TIME

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.748
SO. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:53.282

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.517
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THE

PROGRAM AND I'VE BEEN TALKING

BENEFIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY NINE

TAX CREDITS. ALTHOUGH THEY MAY

02:22:49.694 --> 02:22:51.896
PROVIDE RELIEF WON'T. OFFSET

02:22:51.963 --> 02:22:53.064
ANY OF THE INTEREST THAT

02:22:53.131 --> 02:23:00.638
ACCRUES AGAINST. THE DEBTORS IS

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:01.940
THAT CORRECT. ALL RIGHT YEAH I

02:23:02.006 --> 02:23:02.840

THAT PAID. THE TRUST SO. IF

02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:12.750
THERE IS A- IN THE U. TRUST

02:23:12.817 --> 02:23:13.551
FUND FOR THE STATE OF

02:23:13.618 --> 02:23:17.188
CALIFORNIA THAT IS- OVER TWO

02:23:17.255 --> 02:23:18.923
CONSECUTIVE YEARS THERE THERE

02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:20.491
WOULD BE AN IMPACT ON THE

02:23:20.558 --> 02:23:24.762
EMPLOYER TAX RATE. AT THE

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:25.697
FEDERAL LEVEL WELL THIS. AT THE

02:23:25.763 --> 02:23:27.632

THE STATE HAS A NEGATIVE

02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:42.480
BALANCE- THAT CREDIT IS

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:46.184
REDUCED- ANNUALLY- FROM A FIVE

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:48.653
POINT 4% AND I THINK IT'S POINT

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:52.123
3% ANNUALLY. SO IT. IT AND

BUSINESSES PARTICULAR MEDIUM TO

02:27:07.018 --> 02:27:08.886
LARGE SIZED BUSINESSES- THAT

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:09.987
THEY TEND TO SHOULDER A LOT OF

02:27:10.054 --> 02:27:15.660

COMMITTEE OR MAYBE THE CHAIR

02:27:21.699 --> 02:27:23.634
OUR OUR OFFICE WAS NOT-

02:27:23.701 --> 02:27:24.602
NECESSARILY INVOLVED WITH THE

02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:25.803
CRAFTING OF THIS ELEMENT OF THE

02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:27.338
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. FAIR

02:27:27.405 --> 02:27:29.640
ENOUGH. FIVE JUST A COUPLE

02:27:29.707 --> 02:27:31.509
THOUGHT SENATOR NEWMAN FIRST

02:27:31.576 --> 02:27:33.711
OFF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:36.747
WAIVED INTEREST RATES FOR THE

02:27:36.814 --> 02:27:38.716
U. Y. DE THREE SEPTEMBER. WE

02:27:38.783 --> 02:27:39.417
DON'T KNOW ABOUT MOVING

02:27:39.483 --> 02:27:42.053
FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY ON YOUR

02:27:42.119 --> 02:27:44.455
PREVIOUS QUESTION ONCE THE

02:27:44.522 --> 02:27:45.957
LEGISLATURE PUTS THE TAX CREDIT

02:27:46.023 --> 02:27:48.125
IN PLACE IT WOULD TAKE A TWO

02:27:48.192 --> 02:27:50.761
THIRDS VOTE. TO ELIMINATE THAT

02:27:50.828 --> 02:27:52.964
TAX CUT FROM SMALL BUSINESSES

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:55.366
SO. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE

02:27:55.433 --> 02:27:57.235
TO VOTE BY TWO THIRDS TO

02:27:57.301 --> 02:28:00.972
ELIMINATE IT- THE LOGIC FOR

02:28:01.038 --> 02:28:05.409
THIS. IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME IS

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:09.513
THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE- STOCK

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:11.649
MARKET IN OTHER INDICATORS MANY

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:13.618
OF OUR LARGER BUSINESSES HAVE

02:28:13.684 --> 02:28:16.654
BEEN DOING. VERY WELL AND SOME

02:28:16.721 --> 02:28:19.123
PROFITING. YOU KNOW DOING THEM

02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:21.158
FAR BETTER IN FACT UNDER THIS

02:28:21.225 --> 02:28:23.828
PANDEMIC WERE AS OR SMALL

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:25.529
BUSINESSES. HAVE BEEN

02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:27.531
PARTICULARLY HURT NOW OBVIOUSLY

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:28.666
THERE'S ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS THERE

02:28:28.733 --> 02:28:30.268
SOME LARGE BUSINESSES WHO WERE

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:32.770
HURT ALSO BUT IN GENERAL THE

02:28:32.837 --> 02:28:34.905
SMALL BUSINESSES HAD A FAR

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:37.975
WORSE ECONOMIC IMPACT THEN THE

02:28:38.042 --> 02:28:41.112
LARGER. BUSINESSES SO THE

02:28:41.178 --> 02:28:43.381
MOTIVATION WAS TO HELP THOSE

02:28:43.447 --> 02:28:43.981
WHO ARE MOST WHO'VE BEEN MOST

02:28:44.048 --> 02:28:46.584

BILLION IT MAKE A COMMENT WHAT

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:04.368

02:53:32.435 --> 02:53:51.120
FOR ONE MOMENT.

02:54:28.291 --> 02:54:29.325
SENATOR DRAWS

02:54:29.392 --> 02:54:30.893
OR DID YOU WANT TO COME IN HERE

02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:37.433
ON ANY OF THOSE. I'M TRYING TO

02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:38.034
REMEMBER THE PARTICULARS OF IT

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:47.877
BUT. THIS COMES UNDER- YES- I'M

02:54:47.944 --> 02:54:49.879
NOT SURE WHAT WHAT IT'S IT IS

02:54:49.946 --> 02:54:51.747
AN EMERGENCY IT'S SEVEN FIVE

02:54:51.814 --> 02:54:53.049
MA'AM IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY

02:54:53.115 --> 02:54:54.417
ITS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:54:54.483 --> 02:54:55.418
GENERAL FUNDS FOR HOMELESS

02:54:55.484 --> 02:54:57.253
YOUTH EMERGENCY SERVICES COUNTY

02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:00.323
HOUSING WHICH SOUNDS AMAZING

02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:03.326
BUT IT IS ALSO- I BELIEVE EIGHT

02:55:03.392 --> 02:55:04.660
TIMES THE AMOUNT THAT IT WAS

02:55:04.727 --> 02:55:05.795
LAST YEAR SO I'M JUST CURIOUS

02:55:05.862 --> 02:55:07.630
ARE WE SERVING MORE REVIEWS

02:55:07.697 --> 02:55:10.132
WHICH IS GOOD WELL IT'S SAD

02:55:10.199 --> 02:55:10.867
THAT THEY'RE HELPING YOU KNOW

02:55:10.933 --> 02:55:13.035
HOMELESS BUT- I JUST WONDER WHY

02:55:13.102 --> 02:55:15.271
INCREASE SO DRESS ON AND I CAN

02:55:15.338 --> 02:55:17.139
ADDRESS THAT OKAY ON THE

02:55:17.206 --> 02:55:21.677
HOMELESS OBVIOUSLY. THE- WE

02:55:21.744 --> 02:55:23.512
HAVE INCREASED THE INVESTMENT

02:55:23.579 --> 02:55:25.081
FOR HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL.

02:55:25.147 --> 02:55:27.617
BUT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR HOMES

02:55:27.683 --> 02:55:29.719
PROGRAMS DON'T NECESSARILY

02:55:29.785 --> 02:55:31.120
SERVE HOMELESS YOUTH IN BECAUSE

02:55:31.187 --> 02:55:33.189
HOMELESS YOUTH HAVE. VERY

02:55:33.256 --> 02:55:36.726
PARTICULAR NEEDS. ON AN OFTEN

02:55:36.792 --> 02:55:39.161
SHOULD BE A SEGREGATED SAFE

02:55:39.228 --> 02:55:41.297
FROM ADULTS TURNING ON THE H.

02:55:41.364 --> 02:55:43.065
SO IT WAS FELT THAT WE NEEDED

02:55:43.132 --> 02:55:45.534
TO SEPARATE SOME FUNDS. IN OUR

02:55:45.601 --> 02:55:47.203
INVESTMENT OVERALL HOMELESSNESS

02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:48.871
IS A GREAT DEAL LARGER

02:55:48.938 --> 02:55:51.073
OBVIOUSLY THAN LAST YEAR'S AND

02:55:51.140 --> 02:55:53.376
SO THIS IS I WOULD SAY PROBABLY

02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:55.378
NOT PROPORTIONATELY LARGER BUT

02:55:55.444 --> 02:55:57.046
LARGER FOR THAT REASON. THAT'S

02:55:57.113 --> 02:55:58.748
PERFECT MA'AM I JUST LIKE IT

02:55:58.814 --> 02:56:00.917
WAS A GOOD PROPOSAL BUT I JUST

02:56:00.983 --> 02:56:02.451
DIDN'T. UNDERSTAND WHY THE

02:56:02.518 --> 02:56:04.287
INCREASE CAN I JUST ACCEPT THAT

02:56:04.353 --> 02:56:05.988
AS- THE SAME THING WITH THE

02:56:06.055 --> 02:56:11.294
STATE- ITEM NUMBER- TWENTY FOUR

02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:12.995
AT ITS TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONE

02:56:13.062 --> 02:56:15.231
TIMES GENERAL FUND FOR THE NEXT

02:56:15.298 --> 02:56:17.400
THREE FISCAL YEARS. FOR THE CAL

02:56:17.466 --> 02:56:20.202
THE A. P. PROGRAM FOR YES YES

02:56:20.269 --> 02:56:21.570
SO THAT'S SEVEN TIMES HIGHER

02:56:21.637 --> 02:56:23.539
THAN LAST YEAR AND THE REST OF

02:56:23.606 --> 02:56:25.374
THAT IS THE SAME. CORRECT I'M

02:56:25.441 --> 02:56:27.510
SURE THE SET PAD THAT YOUR MATE

02:56:27.576 --> 02:56:28.911
THE STRUCTURE MAY WANT TO

02:56:28.978 --> 02:56:31.948
ADDRESS THAT BUT I CAN SAY.

02:56:32.014 --> 02:56:36.452
THAT- WE- OUR SUBCOMMITTEE

02:56:36.519 --> 02:56:39.188
WANTED TO INCREASE THE

02:56:39.255 --> 02:56:41.290
INVESTMENT IN THE CALIPHATE

02:56:41.357 --> 02:56:42.458
THEIR MIND GUN VIOLENCE

02:56:42.525 --> 02:56:44.660
PREVENTION LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF

02:56:44.727 --> 02:56:46.395
THE PROJECTIONS THAT WE MAY NOT

02:56:46.462 --> 02:56:48.364
HAVE. FUNDING TO DO SO WE WERE

02:56:48.431 --> 02:56:51.434
UNABLE TO- HOWEVER I THINK ALL

02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:54.203
OF US KNOW. TRAGICALLY GUN

02:56:54.270 --> 02:56:58.307
VIOLENCE IS UP. AND SO TOO IT

02:56:58.374 --> 02:57:01.010
IS OBVIOUSLY THE TIME THAT WE

02:57:01.077 --> 02:57:03.112
WOULD WANT TO GREATLY INCREASE

02:57:03.179 --> 02:57:04.714
OUR INVESTMENT IN THOSE

02:57:04.780 --> 02:57:06.615
ACTIVITIES THAT CAN HELP REDUCE

02:57:06.682 --> 02:57:09.151
GUN VIOLENCE AND I'M SURE THAT

02:57:09.218 --> 02:57:11.287
WENT INTO THE SUB COMMITTEES

02:57:11.354 --> 02:57:13.456
DELIBERATIONS AND I READ MANY

02:57:13.522 --> 02:57:15.725
STAKEHOLDER LETTERS. ON THIS

02:57:15.791 --> 02:57:18.828
PARTICULAR ITEM- BUT I CAN

02:57:18.894 --> 02:57:20.396
CERTAINLY ALLOW THE SCEPTRE

02:57:20.463 --> 02:57:22.465
COMMON IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO

02:57:22.531 --> 02:57:24.266
SENATOR DRUGS OR- THIS IS ON

02:57:24.333 --> 02:57:25.868
ACCOUNT THAT I DON'T HAVE

02:57:25.935 --> 02:57:27.937
ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD. OKAY

02:57:28.004 --> 02:57:28.871
THANK YOU MA'AM AND THEN MY

02:57:28.938 --> 02:57:30.840
LAST QUESTION AGAIN WE WERE

02:57:30.906 --> 02:57:31.741
ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE A

02:57:31.807 --> 02:57:33.509
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF VOTES

02:57:33.576 --> 02:57:36.812
TOGETHER SO- IT'S A SEVEN FOUR

02:57:36.879 --> 02:57:37.880
AND IT'S ON THE U. I TRUST

02:57:37.947 --> 02:57:40.783
FUND- SO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE

02:57:40.850 --> 02:57:42.952
ARE. THE RECOMMENDATION ON ITEM

02:57:43.019 --> 02:57:44.420
NUMBER THIRTY ONE FROM THE

02:57:44.487 --> 02:57:46.288
SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE WHICH IS US

02:57:46.355 --> 02:57:47.423
AT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO

02:57:47.490 --> 02:57:49.058
REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S ONE POINT

BREAKS. IF WE ACCEPTED THE

GOVERNOR'S ONE POINT ONE

02:57:57.967 --> 02:58:00.136
BILLION DIRECT REDUCTION THAT

02:58:00.202 --> 02:58:01.771
SAVES THE STATE ABOUT TWENTY

02:58:01.837 --> 02:58:02.705
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN

02:58:02.772 --> 02:58:04.507
INSURANCE INTEREST PAYMENTS

02:58:04.573 --> 02:58:06.942
WILL THESE TAX CREDITS APPLIED

02:58:07.009 --> 02:58:09.812
TO THE REDUCTION OF THE U. I

BALANCE OF THE SEASON THE DEBT.

02:58:48.684 --> 02:58:50.719

BUT I WAS DISTRACTED NOW

02:58:59.095 --> 02:59:00.429
BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING OUT OR

QUESTION WHICH I CAN'T NUMBER

ONE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

02:59:15.144 --> 02:59:16.445
WAIVED INTEREST THERE'S NO

02:59:16.512 --> 02:59:18.147
INTEREST UNTIL SEPTEMBER

02:59:18.214 --> 02:59:20.015
WHETHER THEY ACT FURTHER WE

02:59:20.082 --> 02:59:22.351
DON'T KNOW YET NUMBER TWO THE

02:59:22.418 --> 02:59:25.855
WAY THAT THE- PAY DOWN WAS

02:59:25.921 --> 02:59:27.423
STRUCTURED UNDER THE DEPARTMENT

02:59:27.490 --> 02:59:30.292
OF FINANCE WHILE IT WAS PAYING

02:59:30.359 --> 02:59:32.461
DOWN LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE DECK.

02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:34.430
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BENEFITED

02:59:34.497 --> 02:59:38.000
THE- BUSINESSES UNTIL. GOOD

02:59:38.067 --> 02:59:40.302
POINT THE FUTURE PERHAPS TWENTY

02:59:40.369 --> 02:59:41.537
TWENTY NINE EVEN TWENTY THIRD

02:59:41.604 --> 02:59:44.406
ADDITIONALLY IT WAS. FOR ALL

02:59:44.473 --> 02:59:48.444
AND- OUR STRUCTURE NOW WITH A

02:59:48.511 --> 02:59:49.812
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

02:59:49.879 --> 02:59:52.715
CREDIT ON GOING. WHAT IS

02:59:52.781 --> 02:59:54.083
TARGETED TOWARDS OUR SMALLER

02:59:54.150 --> 02:59:55.851
BUSINESSES WHO OBVIOUSLY ARE

02:59:55.918 --> 02:59:57.753
THE ONES WHO SUFFERED THE MOST

02:59:57.820 --> 02:59:59.321
DURING THIS PANDEMIC THEY HAD

02:59:59.388 --> 03:00:01.724
THE MOST ECONOMIC IMPACT. AND

03:00:01.790 --> 03:00:04.260
DUST THE- THE ABILITY TO PAY

03:00:04.326 --> 03:00:09.265
THAT DEBT IS WHAT IS- HAS A

03:00:09.331 --> 03:00:11.467
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEM MORE

03:00:11.534 --> 03:00:12.935
THAN MOST OF OUR LARGE

03:00:13.002 --> 03:00:15.304
BUSINESSES NOW NOT ALL OF OUR

03:00:15.371 --> 03:00:17.439
LARGE BUSINESSES THRIVE. DURING

03:00:17.506 --> 03:00:20.075
THE PANDEMIC BUT MANY DID THUS

03:00:20.142 --> 03:00:23.312
YOU SEE THE- EVERY AND ECONOMIC

03:00:23.379 --> 03:00:24.813
INDICATOR SHOWS THAT THE ROPE

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:26.949
THE STOCK MARKET OUR OWN

03:00:27.016 --> 03:00:28.984
REVENUES VARIOUS OTHER THINGS

03:00:29.051 --> 03:00:30.786
SO THE FEELING WAS IN OUR

03:00:30.853 --> 03:00:33.022
RESTRUCTURING. THAT THE

03:00:33.088 --> 03:00:35.457
LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSIBILITY AT

03:00:35.524 --> 03:00:37.026
THIS POINT IN TIME WAS TO MAKE

03:00:37.092 --> 03:00:38.961
SURE THAT WE ARE ASSISTING

03:00:39.028 --> 03:00:42.364
THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE

03:00:42.431 --> 03:00:43.799
MOST ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED. AND

03:00:43.866 --> 03:00:45.367
THEN MY FINAL QUESTION THEN WE

03:00:45.434 --> 03:00:46.735
CAN VOTE MA'AM I APPRECIATE

03:00:46.802 --> 03:00:48.504
YOUR COMMENTS AND TWO BILLION

03:00:48.571 --> 03:00:49.338
DOLLARS OF UNEMPLOYMENT

03:00:49.405 --> 03:00:50.839
INSURANCE TAX CREDIT SINCE THAT

03:00:50.906 --> 03:00:52.174
WAS REDONE REJECTING THE

03:00:52.241 --> 03:00:53.676
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT COMING

03:00:53.742 --> 03:00:55.678
UP WITH THE SENATE'S. PROPOSAL

03:00:55.744 --> 03:00:59.281
AND IT SAYS IT GOES FROM TWENTY

03:00:59.348 --> 03:00:59.882
TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY

03:00:59.949 --> 03:01:00.449
TWENTY THIRTY THREE CAN WE

03:01:00.516 --> 03:01:01.183
DURING THIS BUDGET BIND FUTURE

03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:03.886
LEGISLATURES. AND ABILITY TO

03:01:03.953 --> 03:01:05.054
CRAFT THEIR OWN BUDGET WILL

03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:06.355
THIS CONTINUE TO GO WHERE CAN

03:01:06.422 --> 03:01:09.158
IT BE CIRCUMVENTED NEXT CYCLE

03:01:09.225 --> 03:01:11.527
FOR OR THE CYCLE AFTER. SO ANY

03:01:11.594 --> 03:01:14.430
STATUTE WE PASS CAN BE UNDONE

03:01:14.496 --> 03:01:16.565
BY A FUTURE LEGISLATURE HOWEVER

03:01:16.632 --> 03:01:18.334
IN THIS CASE IT WOULD REQUIRE A

03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:20.169
TWO THIRDS VOTE BECAUSE IT IS A

03:01:20.236 --> 03:01:22.805
TAX CREDIT. BUT WE CAN AFFECT

03:01:22.871 --> 03:01:25.074
CAN NEER FULLY BIND ANY FUTURE

03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:27.409
LEGISLATURE THOUGH BY TWO

03:01:27.476 --> 03:01:29.245
THIRDS VOTES IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY

03:01:29.311 --> 03:01:30.112
BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO

03:01:30.179 --> 03:01:32.681
