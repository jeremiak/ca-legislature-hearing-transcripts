00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.796
THEY COULD NOT MONETIZE THOSE

00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:50.262
DANGEROUS ASPECTS OF THESE

EXISTENCE OF THE RABBIT HOLE ON

SOCIAL MEDIA OUR RESEARCH UNIT

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:03.675
SHORENSTEIN HAS BEEN LOOKING

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:05.177
DEEPER AT THIS PHENOMENON.

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:06.278
GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE

00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:07.712
MEANS GETTING PULLED INTO

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:08.947
ONLINE COMMUNITIES ARE SUB

00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:10.715
CULTURES WHERE THE SLAYING

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:12.551

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:14.719
UNFAMILIAR BUT NEVERTHELESS

COMPLETELY ENGROSSING.

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:18.123
THEREFORE ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.491
OF SOCIAL MEDIA THAT LEADS

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:21.193
SOMEONE DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE.

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:23.295
INCLUDING ABOUT A MINUTE-

00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:25.797
REPUTATION WHICH IS A KEY

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:26.965
FEATURE THAT RELATES TO SEEING

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:28.800
THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER ON

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:31.636
A SINGLE PRODUCT. REDUNDANCY IS

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:32.237
SEEING THE SAME THING ACROSS

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:33.538
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:35.140
RESPONSIVENESS IS HOW SOCIAL

00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:36.808
MEDIA AND SEARCH ENGINES ALWAYS

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.877
PROVIDES SOME ANSWER UNLIKE

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:40.745
OTHER FORMS OF MEDIA SO IF YOU

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:43.748
ASK YOUR- SEARCH ENGINE WHAT IS

00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:46.685
Q. AN HONOR WHAT IS-

ELECTROMAGNETIC VACCINES. YOU

00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:53.992
REINFORCEMENT IS THE WAY THAT

ALGORITHMS WORK TO CONNECT

00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:57.229
PEOPLE AND CONTENT SO THAT ONCE

KEYWORD ALGORITHMS WILL

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:02.634
REINFORCE THESE INTERESTS. SO

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:04.603
REPETITION REDUNDANCY

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:05.203
RESPONSIVENESS AND

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.873
REINFORCEMENT ARE KEY ASPECTS

00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:09.641
OF THE DESIGN OF SOCIAL MEDIA

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:12.777
PLATFORMS MAKE KEEP PEOPLE.

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:15.080

CONSPIRACY THEORIES IDEAS ARE

00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:25.490

BUT WHAT'S AND- HERE IS ABOUT

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:41.873
THE WAY IN WHICH THE RABBIT

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.743

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:47.746
FIRST TOP THE STEEL AND WHAT'S

00:25:47.812 --> 00:25:50.448
REALLY AREN'T THAT IMPORTANT IS

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:53.018
THAT WE KNOW THAT FACEBOOK ALSO

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:55.787
KNEW. THAT THEIR STOCK THE

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:56.922
STEEL GROUPS WERE GROWING

00:25:56.988 --> 00:25:58.290
EXPONENTIALLY ON THEIR

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:01.660
PLATFORMS AND ADDS SOME OF THIS

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:03.228
CONTENT TO WAS VIOLENT AND

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:05.030
EXCITING AND FACEBOOK

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:07.265
STRUGGLED. TO REMOVE THAT

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:09.067
CONTENT BECAUSE OF THIS SHEER

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:11.770
SCALE AND VOLUME AT WHICH IT

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:13.571
WAS ARE CURRENTLY.

00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:15.941
MISINFORMATION IS A SCARE AT

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:18.243
SCALE IS A FEATURE OF FACEBOOK

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.911
SOUND DESIGN AND IT'S NOT

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:21.980
EASILY ROUTED OUT. AND BECAUSE

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:23.615
FACEBOOK DEFINES THE PROBLEM OF

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:25.183
MISINFORMATION AT SCALE IS ONE

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.651
OF COORDINATED INAUTHENTIC

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:28.453
BEHAVIOR THEY WERE WOEFULLY

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.055
UNPREPARED TO HANDLE THE

THREATS POSED BY THEIR OWN

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.758
PRODUCTS. BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:35.160
ANOTHER FUTURE IS POSSIBLE IF

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:36.461
TECH COMPANIES REGULATORS

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:38.196
RESEARCHERS AND ADVOCACY IN THE

SHOULD THIS BE A SOCIAL

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:40.358
RESPONSIBILITY IN YOUR VIEW. OR

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:42.060
EVEN AN INDUSTRY IT HAS TO BE A

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:44.295
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY I'LL TELL

YOU ARE WE FOLLOWING THE Q.

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:48.433
ANON COMMENT ON FOR QUITE A

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.502
LONG TIME BEFORE IT. WE BECAME

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:52.937
A MASSIVE PHENOMENON. AND STILL

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.472
THERE ARE POINTS ALONG THE WAY

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:56.641
THAT IT IF YOU DO SPECIALIZE IN

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:58.543
UNDERSTANDING THESE DIFFERENT

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.445
SUBCULTURES YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:02.013
THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.948
GROW THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:04.783
START TO GET MORE AND MORE

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:09.354
ATTENTION- BUTTE COUNTY MAN-

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.489
FIGURE OUT TO SOME DEGREE

00:28:11.556 --> 00:28:13.391
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE PLANNING

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:15.493
FOR MASS VIOLENT EVENTS. IT WAS

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.495
NO SURPRISE TO ANY RESEARCHER

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:19.731
JOURNALIST THAT WAS COVERING-

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:21.466
MAGGA AFTER THE ELECTION THAT

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:22.600
THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.736
INCIDENT AT THE CAPITOL PEOPLE

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:25.370
KNEW THAT THE CAPITAL WAS GONNA

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:28.173
BE STORMED- BUT IT DOES TAKE A

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:30.775
VERY STATUS ACTUALIZED OF

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:33.178
KNOWLEDGE WHERE PEOPLE ARE.

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:35.914
RESEARCHING AND WATCHING THESE-

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.182
THESE THESE PHENOMENON

00:28:37.248 --> 00:28:38.817
DEVELOPED AND IT'S REALLY A

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:40.852
PROBLEM OF SCALE THAT IF YOU

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:42.153
THINK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.222
PLATFORMS THERE REALLY LIKE-

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:46.558
BOOMBOXES. THE CONTENT IS THE

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:47.992
CASSETTE TAPE THAT GOES IN THEM

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:49.494
AND THEN OUR ALGORITHMS ON THE

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.330
VOLUME THAT DRIVES. HOW MANY

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:54.032
PEOPLE END UP HEARING IT SUIT

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:55.233
YOU SHOULD REALLY THINK ABOUT

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.602
THEM. I IN THAT WAY AND THINK

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:59.370
ABOUT WELL WHO TURNS THE VOLUME

00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:01.005
AND RIGHT NOW IT'S PLATFORM

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:03.475
COMPANIES. WHO TEND TO TURN THE

00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:04.876
VOLUME UP ON THINGS THAT ARE

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:07.545
NOT WHEN OUTRAGEOUS- WHICH NOW

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:10.115
WE CAN TELL MOBILIZES PEOPLE TO

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:12.083
DO THINGS OFF PLATFORM BUT SO

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.052
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS-

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:15.653
WHEN I WHEN YOU SAY IT SHOULD

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.622
BE BORNE BY SOCIETY AND LARGER

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:20.959
SOCIAL COST. ARE YOU SAYING BY-

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:23.128
BY THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES-

00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:24.729
BECAUSE THERE THE VOLUME

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:26.631
CONTROLLERS ARE YOU SAYING BY.

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:30.101
BY GOVERNMENT OR SOME OTHER

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:30.702
PUBLIC KIND OF INSTITUTION. I

00:29:30.768 --> 00:29:33.571
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE- A

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:35.773
PUBLIC AGENCY THAT LOOKS OUT

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.775
FOR THIS. KIND OF CONTENT

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:38.510
WHETHER IT'S RUN BY THE

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:41.112
GOVERNMENTS ARE. CONTRACTED IN

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:44.516
SOME WAY TO HAVE CIVIL SOCIETY.

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:46.985
OUR WORK ON THAT ASPECT. BY AND

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:49.787
LARGE LOOKING MEANS LIABILITY

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:51.256
WITHIN THESE COMPANIES SO THERE

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:52.891
ARE NO WAY INCENTIVIZE TO SEEK

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:56.060
OUT. THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:57.529
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:59.164
TWENTY IS WE SAW A FAIR AMOUNT

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.967
OF- DOMESTIC. DISINFORMATION

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:05.003
CAMPAIGNS IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:07.172
WHERE IS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- WE

00:30:07.238 --> 00:30:09.340
SAW MORE FOREIGN INFLUENCE AN

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:12.844
ANONYMOUS. I TAX AND SO I DO

00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:14.913
THINK THAT THIS. DATE THE IT IS

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:17.715
THE TIME NOW FOR SOME FORM OF

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:18.616
GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT ESPECIALLY

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:21.786

IN ORDER TO TARGET- VULNERABLE

SUICIDE AND SELF HARM. I THEY

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:11.629
DO COMPANIES DO WORK VERY HARD

THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT LOOK UP

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:26.477
ONLINE OR DIFFERENT METHODS ARE

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:28.846
AHEAD OF TIME SO. THE COMPANIES

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:30.782
ARE PARTICULARLY FACEBOOK AND

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:33.017
TRIED TO- REMEDY THAT

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:35.820

PERFECT ESPECIALLY ON INSTAGRAM

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.923
AND SO THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.159
HOW THESE ALGORITHMS WORK AND

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:43.961
HOW THEY- AND- INSPIRE CERTAIN

00:32:44.028 --> 00:32:45.763
KINDS OF BEHAVIOR AND SITE

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.964
CERTAIN KINDS OF PUBLIC

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:49.167
UPRISINGS. THE BETTER OFF WE'RE

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:51.035
GOING TO BE AS A SOCIETY IF WE

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.103
CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE HOSE

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.238
HARMS COME FROM AND- AND IF THE

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:56.107
PENALTIES DON'T ALREADY EXIST

00:32:56.174 --> 00:33:00.278
ARE. THEY MAY HAVE TO BE- YOU

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:03.348
KNOW- LOADED ON DOWN THE LINE

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:04.482
THE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS THE

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:06.451
ADVERTISING ON THERE'S A

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:09.554
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF. ADVERTISING

SO WHAT. WE KNOW NOW IS THAT

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:34.278
THE BECAUSE FACEBOOK DOESN'T

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:34.912

IN. WITH THE ROHINGYA THEY'VE

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:09.440
HAVE THEY STARTED TO FERRET OUT

00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:10.942
THOSE SORT OF ACTIVE CALLS FOR

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:13.211
VIOLENCE I DON'T HAVE A SENSE

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:14.545
OF SORT OF HOW THE PLATFORMS

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:16.047

COMING UP IN MARCH WE'RE GONNA

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:31.529
BRING IN CLIMATE. SCIENTISTS

YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW DO YOU

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:33.598
YOU WANT. THE COST ACCORDING

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:35.800
CHANGE AND- GOOD FOR BURKE-

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.335
BURKE DISEASE FOR FRAMEWORK

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:38.703
THAT WERE LOOK INTO ONES LIKE

00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:40.071
YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE COST OF

CANCER. AREN'T TO SOCIETY AND

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:45.209
TO THE LABOR FORCE AND WE'RE

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:46.544
THINKING ABOUT IT PER SECTOR

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:47.778
YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE COST OF

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.380
MISINFORMATION AT SCALE WHEN

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:52.850
MANY- LARGE NEWS RENTS HAVE TO

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.619
BRING ON A DISINFORMATION

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:57.154
REPORTER OR TWO OR THREE. I AND

00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:58.556
YOU SEE THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR

00:35:58.623 --> 00:35:59.724
YEARS IT'S POPPED UP IN A BUNCH

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.193
OF DIFFERENT. ART NEWS ROUNDS

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.394
AND THEN OF COURSE LOCAL NEWS

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:05.296
OPERATIONS ARE NOT ABLE TO

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:06.697
FULLY ARMED BRING ON

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:10.768
DISINFORMATION. REPORTERS BY.

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.403
THE MORE WE SEE DISINFORMATION

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.672
TARGETING LOCAL ELECTIONS AND

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:16.807
HAPPENING ON A- VERY SMALL

00:36:16.874 --> 00:36:18.376
SCALE LIKE KERN THE CASE OF

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.644
WHAT HAPPENED TO MICHAEL TUBBS

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.345
IN STOCKTON WHERE THERE WAS A-

00:36:21.412 --> 00:36:22.947
A FACEBOOK PAGE THAT WAS REALLY

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:25.583
DRIVING THIS IDEA THAT HE WAS A

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.519
VERY CORRUPT. PERSON BUT WE

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:30.855
HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.723
THAT AND WE ARE REALLY. AT THE

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.926
FOREFRONT OF BEGINNING- TRYING

00:36:34.992 --> 00:36:35.760
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WATER THE

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.595
QUANTITATIVE MEASURES THAT

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:39.430
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO USE ARE

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:41.599
IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN SURVEY

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:42.500
FOR INSTANCE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.835
OFFICIALS. RIGHT NOW WHAT WE

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:46.337
KNOW IS EVERYBODY'S QUITTING.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.339
ALEXION OFFICIALS ARE QUITTING.

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:49.607
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:50.708
QUITTING AND ONE OF THE BIG

00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:53.511
REASONS IS THAT THEY CAN'T KEEP

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:55.313
UP WITH THE FLOW-

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:58.049
MISINFORMATION. AND AS WELL IT

00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:59.850
TAKES A IN OUR PERSONAL TOLL ON

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:01.052
THEM ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:03.020
BEING TARGETED WE ALSO SEE A

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:05.556
BUNCH OF PEOPLE- RESIGNING FROM

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:07.358
POSITIONS ON SCHOOL BOARDS FOR

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:08.125
INSTANCE BECAUSE OF THE

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:10.795
TARGETING. AROUND JOHN CRITICAL

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:13.297
RACE THEORY AND TEACHING BRINGS

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.499
AND RACISM ARE TEACHING

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:17.635
CHILDREN ABOUT RACE AND RACISM.

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:19.604
AND SAID THESE ARE BIG SOCIETY

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.205
WIDE STRUGGLES AREN'T THEY'RE

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:22.406
NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED BY

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:24.809
CREATING NEW TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:29.113
NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED. BY-

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.617
FIXING. BUT WE DO HAVE TO HAVE

00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:35.753
THE TECH SECTOR- SB WE HAVE TO

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.221
UNDERSTAND THE TECH SECTOR MUCH

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:38.756
BETTER AND WE HAVE TO EVEN

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:41.025
EXPLORE IDEAS LIKE ANTI TRUST

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:43.694
IN A WAY THAT- MAY SPLIT

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:46.130
ADVERTISING FROM THE OTHER

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.032
FUNCTIONS OF TECH COMPANIES.

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:50.001
AREN'T SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:52.770
THAT OUR ADVERTISING COMPANY IS

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:55.239
ARE SPREADING THE WEALTH AROUND

OROTHER WEB PAGES. AND SO ON

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:02.013
IN SHORT WE DON'T QUITE KNOW

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:03.614
YET WHAT THE TRUE COST OF

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.716
MISINFORMATION ARE BUT IT IS A

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.318
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE WORKING ON

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:09.587
AND I'M HOPEFUL BY EARLY NEXT

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.122
YEAR WE'LL HAVE. A COUPLE OF

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:12.556
DIFFERENT MODELS AND FRAMEWORKS

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.725
THAT WE CAN WORK WITH. I AND

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:15.926
THEY'LL BE CALLED POLICE AND

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:18.829
DISSERTATIONS AND WHAT NOT TO

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:23.234
TAKE UP THAT. PROBLEM THANK YOU

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:23.801

TODAY AND FOR HER HER TESTIMONY

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.578
I WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THE

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:37.782
STATEMENT THAT THE CUSTOMERS A

00:38:37.848 --> 00:38:39.784
FACEBOOK AND- THESE THAT.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.252
SOCIAL PLATFORMS ARE THE COST

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:43.287
ARE THE ADVERTISERS BECAUSE

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:46.190
THAT TOTALLY CHEFS- THE WAY

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:49.093
THAT I THINK OF- OF REGULATION

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.463
AND HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT. THE

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.831
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:56.801
CONTENT AND HOW IT'S BEING

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:58.636
PERVADE- SO THAT THAT WAS

00:38:58.703 --> 00:38:59.737
REALLY VERY INTERESTING AND

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:01.505
THEN I AM I THE ONLY QUESTION I

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:05.976
HAVE. IS THAT- IF HE YOU KNOW

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:08.279
IT IT IT APPEARS THAT AND THERE

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.814
HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION AROUND

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.415
THE ALGORITHMS AND SHARING

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:13.350
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THOSE

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:16.954
ALGORITHMS ARE CREATED FROM AT

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:20.391
THE STATE LEVEL- WE HIRED A

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:24.061
COMPANY WITH A CONTRACT TO DO

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:26.864
SMALL BUSINESS. GRANTS AND IT

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.166
WAS BASED ON AN ALGORITHM AND

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:31.736
IT WAS TRUST ME WE'RE GOING TO

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:33.137
GET TO THE RIGHT. BUSINESSES

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:35.539
THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND-

00:39:35.606 --> 00:39:38.008
AND I THINK THAT IT'S PROVEN TO

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:40.077
BE THE CASE BUT I THE QUESTION

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:43.547
I HAVE IS. IS THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:39:43.614 --> 00:39:44.849
DISCUSSION ABOUT GETTING MORE

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:45.783
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.854
ALGORITHMS ARE ARE CREATED. AND

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.990
AND THAT THEIR PROPRIETARY SO

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:54.091

TRUST US YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.761
WORK OKAY AND IT IT APPEARS TO

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:58.763
ME THAT. THAT IT THAT IT'S THE

00:39:58.829 --> 00:40:01.632
ALGORITHMS THAT CREATED THIS

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.200
CONTENT THAT SHOWED UP ON THE

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:04.635
CAROL SIDE I GUESS WAS THE NAME

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:06.637
OF THE OF THE PERSON THAT THEY

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:09.540
CREATED. AND THEN I JUST.

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:11.575
WONDER IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON.

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:14.044
ON HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:16.580
ABOUT ALGORITHMS AND WILL BE IN

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.849
A WEEK WE WHICH I TEND TO GIVE

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:22.453
GREAT DEFERENCE TO- TO

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.654
CONFIDENCE INTO THINGS THAT ARE

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:25.322
PART OF THE PROPRIETY IN FOR

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:26.557
INFORMATION THAT THE COMPANY'S

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.659
USE BUT IT MAY BE THAT WE NEED

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:29.226
TO LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE BIT

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:31.996
DIFFERENTLY AS WELL. YES SO THE

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:33.197
ALGORITHMS YOU HAVE TO THINK

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.932
ABOUT. YOU KNOW STATE SPOKE

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.300
NICK CLEGG RECENTLY CAME OUT

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.102
AND SAID THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:39.103
ALGORITHMS RUNNING ACROSS

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.605
FACEBOOK. INTO IT'S NOT A CASE

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:45.409
THAT IN. AN ALGORITHM DOES THIS

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:47.111
YOU KNOW ALL OF THE THINGS WHAT

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:48.646
WE EAT WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.347
IS THE FACT THAT. MANY

00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:52.383
DIFFERENT I TECHNOLOGICAL

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:54.385
PIECES LIKE CAST. MEMBER THE

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:55.886
OLD STEREOS WE USED TO HAVE THE

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.321
OF THE RECEIVER IN THE RECORD

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:58.789
PLAYER YOU HAVE THAT CONSENT

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:00.391
ACT. SO THINK ABOUT IT LIKE A

00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:03.060
COMPONENT SYSTEM. AND DIFFERENT

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:05.429
ALGORITHMS ARE GOING. OUT RAINY

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:07.565
CONTENTS AND SORT CONTENT IN

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.233
DIFFERENT WAYS. AND WHAT THE

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.703
RANKING IS BASED ON IS ARE.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.939
THESE LITTLE DIALS OR KNOBS

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:18.108
THAT THEY TURN. WHERE FOR

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:19.777
INSTANCE AT FACEBOOK THEY-

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.313
AFTER JANUARY SIXTH. TURNED OUT

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:26.383
THE KNOB THAT- ON NEWS QUALITY.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.685
AND SO IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:29.320
THE ALGORITHM WAS READING EVERY

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:30.454
PIECE OF NEWS BECAUSE

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:31.689
ALGORITHMS CAN'T TELL YOU

00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:33.023
WHAT'S TRUE OR FALSE OR WHAT'S

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.292
LEFT OR RIGHT. BUT WHAT IT DID

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:37.695
WAS IT IT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT.

00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:40.798
HOW ARE REPUTABLE IS THIS NEWS

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:42.967
ORGANIZATION IS IT WIDELY

00:41:43.033 --> 00:41:45.402
TRUSTED DOES IT. HAVE AN OFFICE

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:48.672
SPACES A HABIT SUBSCRIBERS IS

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:51.275
IT- LET YOU KNOW ARE THERE ARE

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:53.010
ITS ADVERTISERS ON THE UP AND

UP. ON AND IT INCREASED NEWS

00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:58.382
QUALITY AND THROUGHOUT THE SITE

00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:00.851
WHAT YOU SAW. WAS THAT IT LOST

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:02.987
BASED BURKE ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:04.021

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:06.590
CONTROVERSIAL. PEOPLE WEREN'T

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:07.625
SHARING SOME OF THE CONTENT

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:08.993
BECAUSE- FOR INSTANCE THE NEW

PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO GET

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.634

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.435
IT TENDS TO DO REALLY WELL ON

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:20.137
THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IS

THINGS THAT ARE OUTRAGEOUS. AND

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:30.748
SO- IT TIME FOR BUT ONE THAT

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:31.548
YOU MAY THINK OF RELATED TO THE

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:33.284

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.954
ON YOU CRANSTON'S IN TWENTY

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:37.721
EIGHTEEN I WAS INVOLVED IN THE

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.990
STUDY OUR STATE AND SOCIETY ON

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:41.058
THE ALTERNATIVE INFLUENCE

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:42.660
NETWORK WHAT WE SHOWED WAS

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:44.662
BASICALLY THAT. A VERY SMALL

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:45.329
PROPORTION OF WHITE

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:47.598
SUPREMACISTS WERE GETTING. A

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:49.166
LOT OF ATTENTION ACROSS THE

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:50.935
APPS AND MORE MANAGING TO GET

00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:53.437
ON OTHER PEOPLE'S. LIVE STREAMS

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:54.705
AND WE'RE MAKING QUITE A BIT OF

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.440
MONEY BY BEING COMPLETELY

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:58.208
OUTRAGEOUS AND TALKING ABOUT

00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:01.178
YOU KNOW- WHITE GENOCIDE IN THE

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.613
BRAIN THE COMING OF AGE. NO

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.416
STATE. AND SO WE SHOWED THEM

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.083
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.718
CHARACTERISTICS WERE AND WHO

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:09.453
THESE ACCOUNTS WORK AND THEN

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.155
OVER TIME WHAT THEY DID WAS

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:12.456
THEY DEVISED A WAY WHERE THEY

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:14.325
STARTED TO BAN. WHITE

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:16.961
SUPREMACIST CONTENTS AND BUT A

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:18.762
BIG FACTOR WASN'T NECESSARILY

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.397
THAT THE RESEARCH WAS STOCK.

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.299
WHICH IS PART OF IT BUT THE

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:25.636
ADVERTISERS LIKE CISCO DID NOT

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:27.805
WANT THEIR PRODUCTS. BEING

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:30.274
SHOWN OVER WHITE SUPREMACIST

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:32.443
CONTENT AND SO ARE THE

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:34.979
ADVERTISERS REALLY HAD QUITE A

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:37.548
SAY IN HOW THE TECHNOLOGY

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:41.018
OPERATE IT. AND SAY YOU HAVE TO

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:42.386
THINK ABOUT WELL IF THE

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.288
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO REACT TO

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:46.223
ADVERTISING BOYCOTTS. BUT

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.658
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY GONNA

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:51.695
REACT TO OUR COMMUNITY PRESSURE

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:52.496
OR PEOPLE SAYING YOU KNOW

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:54.131
THERE'S A LOT AT. EIGHT FOUR

00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:55.666
CONTENT ON HERE LOTS OF LIKE

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:58.135

00:43:58.202 --> 00:44:00.604
CONTENT. AND YOU KNOW LIVED

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.239
SANTA CLARA FARMS IS OFFERING

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:05.509
AND- IT'S AWFUL BUT LAWFUL. BUT

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:06.877
ONE STEP FURTHER FROM THAT IF

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:08.212
ADVERTISERS SAY HEY I DON'T

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:10.047

HONEST CONTENT. I AND- THEY DO

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.452
CHANGE THE PRODUCT AND SO

00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:16.387
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:17.721
IMPORTANT THAT YOU THINK ABOUT

00:44:17.788 --> 00:44:19.456
THE WEIGHT OF ADVERTISING HERE

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:22.259

BECAUSE WE WANT TO PUSHTHE-

00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:41.345
THE ADVERTISERS TO BE MORE

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:43.347
SENSITIVE TO THAT COMMUNITY

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:44.448
NEEDS AND THAT WHAT THE

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.383

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:54.598
COULD SHIFT OR EVOLVE AND

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:57.334
PERHAPS THEY SHOULD. BUT THAT

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.335
WILL ONLY HAPPEN WITH THE

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:00.070
AGREEMENT OF THE MAJORITY OF

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:01.238
THE PEOPLE ON THE SUPREME

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:03.507
COURT. SO I AM HERE TO TALK

00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:04.775
ABOUT THE BARRIERS THAT NEED TO

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.376
BE NAVIGATED LIFE IN LIGHT OF

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:08.478
THAT PRACTICAL AND LEGAL

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:10.447
REALITY. ACOSTA COUNTRIES

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.049
LEGISLATORS ARE SPENDING TIME

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.817
CRAFTING LEGISLATION THAT IS

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.852
CLEARLY CONTRARY TO THE U. S.

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:16.787
SUPREME COURT'S CURRENT

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:18.889
JURISPRUDENCE. OTHERS ARE

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:20.290
PROPOSING LAWS THAT FALL IN

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:22.092
GRAY AREAS BUT THAT STILL HAVE

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.560
HIGH ODDS OF BEING STRUCK DOWN

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:25.962
ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. SO I

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:27.364
WOULD URGE LAWMAKERS TO BE VERY

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:28.665
CLEAR SIGHTED ABOUT WITH THAT

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:31.835
MEETS- AND ABOUT WHERE AND HOW

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.837
TO SPEND TIME AND TAXPAYER

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.306
MONEY. AND POLITICAL CAPITAL ON

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:38.342
PROPOSALS THAT MAY AT BEST BE

00:49:38.408 --> 00:49:40.844
GAMBLES AT WORST BE A WASTE OF

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:43.580
THAT TIME AND TAXPAYER MONEY

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.582
AND POLITICAL CAPITAL. THE

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.850
FIRST OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:49.286
BARRIERS AND IT IS THE SIMPLEST

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:50.721
IT IS THAT LAWMAKERS CAN'T

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:52.956
PROHIBIT SPEECH THAT IS

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:53.423
PROTECTED BY THE FIRST

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.026
AMENDMENT. IN THE U. S. THAT

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:57.994
INCLUDES SOME HORRIFIC THINGS

00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:59.329
IT INCLUDES THINGS THAT MANY

00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:01.998
PEOPLE FIND MORALLY ABORTS THE

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:05.635
VIDEO OF THE TERRIBLE MASKER IN

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:06.536
CHRISTCHURCH NEW ZEALAND FOR

00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:09.706
EXAMPLE- IS LEGAL TO SHARE IT

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.908
IN MANY PROBABLY MOST CONTACTS

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:14.010
ONLINE. THE SUPREME COURT HAS

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:16.980
EXPLICITLY SAID HE RECENTLY IT

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:18.281
BUT HATE SPEECH IS

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.950
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED WE

00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:21.618
ALSO KNOW THAT LIES INCLUDING

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.387
DANGEROUS LIGHTS ARE OFF AND

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:25.222
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED. A

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:27.724
LAW THAT PROHIBITS THIS LAWFUL

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.826
BUT AWFUL SPEECH IS LIKELY TO

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.695
VIOLATE THE COUPLE WILL HAVE A

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:34.865
THE CONSTITUTION UNDER CURRENT

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.666
SUPREME COURT CASE LAW. THE

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:37.734
SECOND POINT IS ALSO PRETTY

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.569
OBVIOUS BUT MAYBE WHAT SPELLING

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:41.438
OUT IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.373
RESTRICT CERTAIN SPEECH IT ALSO

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.175
CAN'T HELP PLATFORMS TO

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:47.043
RESTRICT THAT SPEECH AND I

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.645
EXPLAINED IN A RECENT PAPER

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.180
THIS INCLUDES LAWS TELLING

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:51.915
PLATFORMS TO TAKE DOWN LAWFUL

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.817
SPEECH. IT ALSO INCLUDES LAWS

00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:54.985
TELLING THEM TO CHANGE

00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:57.020
ALGORITHMS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE

00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:58.555
OR SUPPRESS OR MAKE LESS

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:01.391
VISIBLE THAT SAME LAWFUL BUT

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:03.894
PERHAPS MORALLY TERRIBLE SPEECH

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:04.761
ALL OF THESE ARE THINGS

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.696
PLATFORMS MAY DO VOLUNTARILY

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:08.298
AND OFTEN DO AND I THINK SHOULD

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:10.901
DO. BUT THEY LIE OUTSIDE THE

00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:12.302
POWER OF GOVERNMENT. WELL HERE

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:14.438
IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. CAN I HELP

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:15.739
ON THAT THAT WE SHOULD ALL

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:16.807
AGREE ON WHICH IS THAT

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.675
LAWMAKERS CAN'T CIRCUMVENT THE

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:22.012
CONSTITUTION BY OUTSOURCING

00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:23.513
GOVERNANCE TO PRIVATE PLATFORMS.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.115
GOOD THING NONE OF US WOULD

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:25.715
WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD THAT

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:26.983
BYPASSES BILL OF RIGHTS

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.019
PROTECTIONS THROUGH PRIVATIZED

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.387
GOVERNANCE WHETHER WE'RE

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:31.288
TALKING ABOUT SPEECH ON

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:34.758
PLATFORMS POLICING OR ANYTHING

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:37.527
ELSE THAT AFFECTS ALL RIGHT. MY

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:39.963
THIRD POINT IS MORE COMPLICATED.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.098
LAWMAKERS CAN'T CRAFT RULES BUT

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:43.900
LOOK CONSTITUTIONAL ON THEIR

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:46.236
FACE BUT THAT PREDICTABLY IN

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:47.671
THE FACT THAT ARE GOING TO LEAD

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:49.639
PLATFORMS TO ERR MASSIVELY ON

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:51.041
THE SIDE OF REMOVING LAWFUL

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:53.610
SPEECH. THIS IS THE LESSON FROM

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.078
A SUPREME COURT CASE FROM THE

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:56.580
NINETEEN FIFTIES VERSUS

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:58.615
CALIFORNIA IN WHICH THE COURT

00:51:58.682 --> 00:51:59.983
STRUCK DOWN A LAW HOLDING A LOS

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.419
ANGELES BOOKSELLER LIABLE FOR

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:03.887
BOOKS ON HIS SHELVES. ALTHOUGH

00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:05.422
THE LESSON OF A LARGE BODY OF

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:07.224
HUMAN RIGHTS LITERATURE WARNING

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.925
AGAINST LEGAL OBLIGATIONS THAT

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.560
INCENTIVIZE PLATFORMS TO

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:12.162
PROTECT THEMSELVES BY TAKING

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:14.598
DOWN THEIR USERS. BUT ACTUALLY

00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:16.399
LEGAL SPEECH WE KNOW THAT RULES

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:18.301
LIKE THIS ARE ABUSE OF THE

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:19.736
GOVERNMENT ACT OF ECUADOR FOR

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.505
EXAMPLE SEEMINGLY USED FALSE

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.772
LEGAL ALLEGATIONS TO GET

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.641
YOUTUBE FACEBOOK AND OTHER

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:26.042
PLATFORMS TO REMOVE VIDEO

00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:28.712
FOOTAGE OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:30.213
CRITICAL JOURNALISM. THIS IS AN

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.615
AREA WHERE A LOT OF MY RESEARCH

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.617
FOCUSES ON THAT YES I'M HAPPY

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:34.885
TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT THE

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:36.720
DETAIL CARE AND CLEANING HOW

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:38.154
NOT JUST SPEECH RIGHTS THAT

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:39.389
RIGHTS TO PRIVACY AND EQUAL

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:41.658
PROTECTION CAN BE ON THE LINE.

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:43.960
WITH LAWS LIKE THIS. THE FOURTH

00:52:44.027 --> 00:52:45.328
OF MY FIVE POINT GETS INTO

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:46.830
TERRITORY THAT IS A LESSON TO

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.832
IT. AND WHILE THE FIRST THREE

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.600
POINTS MORE MOST RELEVANT FOR

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.702
PROPOSALS CURRENTLY COMING MORE

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.538
FROM THE POLITICAL LEFT. THIS

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:55.739
ONE RELATES TO PROPOSALS THAT

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:57.140
TEND TO COME TODAY FROM THE

00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:59.309
POLITICAL RIGHT. TO BE CLEAR I

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.710
DON'T ACTUALLY THINK ANY OF

00:53:00.777 --> 00:53:01.845
THINGS THESE THINGS ARE

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.980
INNATELY POLITICAL OR LEFT

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:05.916
RIGHT ISSUES- BUT THIS IS HOW

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:08.051
THE POLITICS IN AMERICA TODAY

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:09.352
HAPPENS TO LINE UP. THE

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:11.321
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE IS THIS

00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:13.557
LAWMAKERS CAN'T TELL PLATFORMS

00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:15.592
WHAT EDITORIAL STANDARDS TO SAT

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:17.294
OR DICTATE THEIR CONTENT

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.295
MODERATION OR BANKING

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.163
STANDARDS. JUST AS GOVERNMENT

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:21.798
CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT LAWFUL

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.267
SPEECH THEY MUST TAKE DOWN.

00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:26.903
THEY ALSO CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.838
LAWFUL SPEECH THEY MUST CARRY.

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.340
THIS IS WHY IT DISTRICT COURT

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:31.708
RECENTLY STRUCK DOWN A FLORIDA

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:32.842
LAW THAT ATTEMPTED TO DO

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.544
JUSTICE THANK THAT POPCORN'S

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:35.845
HAD TO LEAVE UP CERTAIN

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:38.081
ACCOUNTS OR POSTS RELATING TO

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:38.582
ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL

00:53:38.648 --> 00:53:40.684
DISCUSSION. AND TO BE CLEAR THE

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.352
CASE LAW HERE ISN'T ABOUT

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:44.120
INTERNET USERS SPEECH RIGHT SO

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:47.824
MUCH. THIS IS ABOUT PLATFORM

00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.025
SPEECH RIGHT. FOR BETTER OR FOR

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.393
WORSE THERE IS A LONG OF

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.394
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:53.863
IDENTIFYING EDITORIAL RATES FOR

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:54.998
COMPANIES THAT SELECTIVELY

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.967
CHERRY THIRD PARTY SPEECH.

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:58.468
INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE CABLE

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:01.171
COMPANIES AND JUDGES INCLUDING

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:02.505
BRETT KAVANAUGH TWENTY SADDAM

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:05.675
THAT THE- DC. CIRCUIT COURT I

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:07.010
HAVE POINTED OUT THESE

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.912
PRESIDENTS AS CLEAR BARRIERS TO

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:10.246
HAVING SIMILAR MUST CARRY

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:13.316
OBLIGATIONS FOR PLATFORMS LIKE

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:14.951
YOUTUBE OR TWITTER. THIS TOO IS

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:16.853
AN AREA I HAVE A LONG ARTICLE

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.055
ABOUT AND I AM HAPPY TO TALK

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.757
MORE ABOUT IT IF PEOPLE ARE

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:22.759
INTERESTED IN DOING SO. MY

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:24.160
FINAL POINT AND THIS IS ONE I

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:26.129
HAVE TRULY MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:27.163
IS THAT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.932
VERY STEEP CONSTITUTIONAL

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.368
BARRIERS. EVEN TOO MANY FORMS

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:33.103
OF COMPELLED TRANSPARENCY

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:35.472
REPORTING FOR COMPANIES. ERIC

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:37.173
GOLDMAN HIS TESTIFYING AFTER ME

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.708
HAS DONE MORE RESEARCH ON THIS

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.043
TOPIC AND CAN SPEAK MORE TO THE

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.479
LAW BUT THE BASIC ISSUE AS LAID

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.080
OUT IN A RECENT CASE THAT

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:45.982
STRUCK DOWN A MARYLAND LAW

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:47.817
REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY ABOUT

00:54:47.884 --> 00:54:49.986
CAMPAIGN ADS. GETS BACK TO THIS

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:51.187
IDEA THAT PLATFORMS ARE

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:52.822
FUNCTIONING OF PUBLISHERS AND

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.357
THAT COMPELLING A PLATFORM TO

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:55.992
STATE WHAT SPEECH AT REJECTED

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:58.361
AND WHY IT IS SIMILAR TO

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.397
FORCING THE LOS ANGELES TIMES

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.165
TO SAY WHAT ARTICLES IT MAN.

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:05.635
AND WHY AND SHOULD EXPLAIN ITS

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:06.670
PROCESS FOR DECISION MAKING. I

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.672
DON'T LOVE THAT OUTCOME I

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:10.473
CONSIDER MYSELF AN ADVOCACY FOR

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.442
BETTER TRANSPARENCY AND I AM

00:55:12.509 --> 00:55:13.943
HAPPY THAT PENDING EUROPEAN

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.745
UNION LAWS ARE LIKELY TO GET IT

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.647
FOR US. I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:18.848
THINKING ABOUT WHAT GOOD

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.483
TRANSPARENCY LOOKS LIKE ABOUT

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.986
HOW TO DO TRANSPARENCY AND NOT

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:24.654
WHETHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL.

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:27.123
CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS IT AS A

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.826
LEGAL OBLIGATION. THAT SAID I

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:31.494
WOULD ALSO BE VERY CONCERNED

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:33.096
ABOUT HAVING FIFTY DIFFERENT

COMPLEXITY AND EXPENSE OF

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.404
TRANSPARENCY REPORTING ARE VERY

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.206
REAL PARTICULARLY FOR SMALLER

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:44.908
COMPANIES IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:46.843
IMPOSE THAT COST AND ACCEPT THE

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:47.911
BURDEN THAT MAY PLACE ON

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:49.112

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.680
DIVERSITY OF ONLINE SPEECH

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:52.382
ECOSYSTEMS. WE SHOULD HAVE A

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:54.184
CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT BENEFITS

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.385
WE'RE GETTING AND WHAT

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:57.587
PARTICULAR KINDS OF DISCLOSURES

00:55:57.654 --> 00:55:59.689
ARE LIKELIEST TO GET US THERE.

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:01.791
ALL CLOSE BY BRIEFLY MENTIONING

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:03.093
A COUPLE OF OTHER PARTS OF THE

00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:05.729
CONSTITUTION. SOME LIKE THIS

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.097
THE PRIMACY AND DORMANT

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.998

FRAGMENTATION- THAT I WAS JUST

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:13.636
REFERRING TO BY RESERVING

00:56:13.703 --> 00:56:14.871
CERTAIN POWERS TO FEDERAL

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:17.006
CONGRESS AND- I CAN ONLY

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.308
IMAGINE HOW FRUSTRATING THAT

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.844
MUST BE TO YOU AS YOU WATCH THE

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.679
GRIDLOCK. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:24.481
OTHERS LIKE THE TAKINGS CLAUSE

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.282

ACCOMMODATIONS MODEL. THAT

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:32.322
WOULD TAKE AWAY PLATFORMS

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:33.790
ABILITY TO ENFORCE CONTENT

00:56:33.857 --> 00:56:36.025

00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:38.128

THE U. S. AND AS I SAID I THINK

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:04.554
THAT CHANGE CAN HELP ADDRESS

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:06.589

SECTION TWO THIRTY ELIMINATE

SOME TYPES OF LIABILITY BASED

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.108
ON THIRD PARTY CONTENT BUT IT

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.976
LEAVES OTHER REGULATORY TOOLS

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:49.379
IN PLACE. FOR THIS REASON I'M

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:51.014
BAFFLED I SEE SECTION TWO

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.448

WEST. INSTEAD I'LL MENTION

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.258
THREE WAYS IN WHICH SECTION TWO

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.559
THIRTY. PRESERVES REGULATORY

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:06.062
EFFORTS. FIRST SECTION TO

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.397
THIRTIES LIABILITY MODEL

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:09.766
ENCOURAGES INTERNET SERVICES TO

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.300
UNDERTAKE SOCIALLY VALUABLE

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.236
EDITORIAL SERVICES THAT THEY

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:15.405
WOULD OTHERWISE ISSUE IF THEY-

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:17.206
FACE LIABILITY FOR THEIR

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.375
EDITORIAL JUDGMENT CALLS WERE

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:21.677
ERRORS. WITHOUT SECTION TWO

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.446
THIRDS PROTECTION AND I BELIEVE

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.781
A STELLAR MENTIONED AS INTERNET

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.816

SPEECH VENUES- AN OUTCOME THAT

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:33.523
NO ONE WOULD FIND VALUABLE. I

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:34.824
THINK THE OTHER MORE LIKELY

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.826
START IS THAT WITHOUT SECTION

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:37.593
TWO THIRTY ERRANT'S SERVICES

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.195

CONTENT TO RISKING AND SIMPLY.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.134
SHUT DOWN OUR ABILITY TO TALK

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.202

RECORD F. IS SET THE ORIGINAL

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.172

RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY LEGAL

VIOLATION ONLINE. AND THE THIRD

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.216
WAY- THE CONGRESS RESERVED

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:02.085
REGULATORY EFFORTS IS THAT

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:03.719

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:27.943
PLACE IN HAVE COMMANDED A HARD

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:32.014
TIME WITH. SPEAK BRIEFLY TO

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.615
THAT I THINK ERIC'S SORT OF IS

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:34.549
THE RIGHT PERSON FOR MOST OF

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.251
THE ANSWER BUT I MEAN ONE PIECE

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.420
IS THAT STATE LEGISLATURES

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:40.055
ABSOLUTELY CAN AND DO CREATE

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:41.523
CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.558
PLATFORMS. UP FOR THINGS THAT

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:45.427
ARE NOT ABOUT THE SPEECH

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:46.428
TRANSMITTED BY THE PLATFORM'S

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.163
USERS SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.732
SEVERAL RECENT- CASES ON CD TWO

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.934
THIRTY- SAYING IT BETTER CLAIM

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.037
CAN PROCEED FOR EXAMPLE-

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:58.840
AGAINST SNAP. BASED ON A BAD

01:17:58.907 --> 01:17:59.975
PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT SNAP

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.543
ITSELF WAS GENERATING OR

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.479
AGAINST AIRBNB- BASED ON-

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:06.581
TRANSACTIONS AND LOCAL HOUSING

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:09.418
REGULATION- BUT- WHERE THE

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.386
CLAIM IS BASED ON SPEECH THAT

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:13.221
USERS POST TO PLATFORMS THAT

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:15.157
DOES MOVE INTO THE SPACE THAT

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:17.225
CONGRESS HAS OCCUPIED. THROUGH

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:19.594
ITS CDA TWO THIRTY NOW FOR THE

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:20.695
SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT YOU'RE

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.030
BRINGING UP THE TRAFFICKING

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:25.834
CLAIMS. THERE WAS A- CHANGE TO

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:26.868
THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION A

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:28.003
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THROUGH

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.806
THAT SESTA FOSTA LEGISLATION

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:31.840
THAT WAS INTENDED TO TARGET

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:33.608
PRECISELY THAT AND WHICH DID

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:34.876
OPEN UP ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.912
CLAIMS- THAT HADN'T EXISTED

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.580
BEFORE. AND I SHOULD BE VERY

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.215
CLEAR WITH YOU THAT I AM

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.516
INVOLVED IN A CONSTITUTIONAL

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.385
CHALLENGE TO SESTA FOSTA I

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:46.455
THINK THAT- BEAT MERRICK'S.

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:47.823
CHALLENGE HAVE BECOME MORE AND

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:49.591
MORE EVIDENCE AS THE YEARS HAVE

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.493
GONE BY SINCE THE LAW PASSED AS

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.928
THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE OF

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.930
BAD LAWS FAILURE TO ACHIEVE ITS

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:57.566
PURPOSES IN AND THE INCREASE IN

01:18:57.632 --> 01:19:01.236
RISK AND HARMS TO- TAKE PEOPLE.

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:03.371
INVOLVED IN COMMERCIAL SEX WORK

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:05.440
SO I DO THINK THERE'S GREAT

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:07.442
COMPLEXITY IN WHAT A

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:09.144
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW COULD LOOK

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:11.246
LIKE ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE BUT

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.914
I THINK THAT IS. YOU KNOW OFF

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:13.982
TO THE SIDE AND I'M NOT THE

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:15.050
SAME AS THE QUESTION YOU'RE

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:16.685
ASKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF THAT

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:18.153
FEDERAL LEGISLATURE VERSUS THE

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:26.928
STATE LEGISLATURES- ERIC DO.

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:27.929
YOU WANT TO SPEAK MORE TO THIS

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:29.998
ONE. BUT WITH THE CHURCH.

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:33.602
ASSURE YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.270
CENTER FOR REYES- THE ISSUE AND

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:37.572
ASKING I THINK SERIES OF IN

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:41.476
QUESTIONS- EVERY OTHER FOCUSED

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:42.477
ON SEX TWO THIRTY I THINK

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:43.512
BESTSELLERS OR TALKED SOME OF

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:47.015
THE- LIMITS- TRUCKS TWO THIRTY

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:47.782
APPLY TO. ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:49.551
WAYS WHICH A MIGHT BE STRUCTURE

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:52.554
WHETHER IT'S AS A- A SAID

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.523
REACHED WITH DAMAGE AS A SIMPLE

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:57.359
RESTRICTION WITH- IN. RELIEF

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:58.827
AVAILABLE A SECTION TWO THIRTY

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:00.328
APPLIES TO ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:20:00.395 --> 01:20:01.930
WAYS TO WHICH- THE LIABILITY

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:04.900
MIGHT ATTACH- THAT TO BE CLEAR

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.501
AND WE DO NEED TO REITERATE ITS

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:08.703
SECTION TWO THIRTY DOESN'T

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:11.106
RESTRICT ANY CLAIMS AGAINST

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.240
ACTUAL WRONG TO WORKERS.

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.276
CAUSING THE HARM TO CHOOSE-

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:16.411
REFERENCED- DOES NEVER BEEN

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:17.412
COVERED BY SECTION TWO THIRTY

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:18.880
SO WE'RE ONLY TALKING NOW ABOUT

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.615
THE INTERMEDIARY SERVICES

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:23.385
LIABILITY- AND IN THAT SECTION

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:24.986
TO HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:27.088
THINGS LIKE NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.924
I SCHEMES ARE ARE INCONSISTENT

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.058
WITH SECTION TWO THIRTIES

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:34.196
PROHIBITIONS- SO- THE FACT THAT

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.764
NOTICES MIGHT WORK IN OTHER

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.065
CONTEXTS SAY THE COPPERY

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:38.767
CONTACTS- THAT DOESN'T

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.001
TRANSLATE INTO THE SECTION TO

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:41.803
THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THERE HAVE

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.238
BEEN OCCASIONAL CHALLENGES TO

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:44.272
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:45.941
SECTION TWO THIRTY THERE ARE

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:48.210
BELIEVE PENDING CHARGES- IN

01:20:48.276 --> 01:20:50.345
COURT TODAY- THOSE CHALLENGES

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:52.147
HAVE GONE GONE ANYWHERE- I

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.215
THINK THAT THIS IS FAIRLY

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:57.485
WITHIN CONGRESS'S. AUTHORITY ON

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.221
TO US STRUCTURE OF THE KIND OF-

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:00.722
SPEECH ENVIRONMENT SAID IT

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.123
WANTS AND THAT'S SINCE WHEN I

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:02.958
THINK ABOUT SECTION TWO THERE

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.326
IS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE FIRST

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:05.961
AMENDMENT THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.295
SAYS THE FLOOR ABOUT THE TIME

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:08.496
DISTRICTS FROM IT IN OUR

01:21:08.563 --> 01:21:10.932
SOCIETY. BUT CONGRESS CAN AND

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:12.901
IN SOME CASES HIGHS AHEAD

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:14.903
DOCTORS SPEECH ENHANCING LAWS

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:15.870
AND YOU MIGHT LOOK AT SECTIONS

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:17.639
THERE IS IN THAT CATEGORY

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.474
WITHIN CONGRESS'S PURVIEW TO DO

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.576
SO- THE LAST. I'M JUST GONNA

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:22.744
MENTION ABOUT- PRIOR RIGHTS OF

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:24.112
ACTION WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:26.448
THE POSSIBILITY THAT- PRIVATE

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:28.617
RIGHTS OF ACTION WOULD BE-

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:31.186
BROUGHT IF ENABLED I JUST FEEL

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:32.454
THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.389
HUMAN HISTORY- AND IN

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:42.697
PARTICULAR- THE LOSS IN FLORIDA

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:44.733
ANTI X. I HAVE INCLUDED. RIGHTS

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.635

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:47.702
DECISION. FOR SERVICE THAT

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:49.437
MAKES BILLION TO. A DAY ABOUT

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:51.640
CONTENT IN THEORY EACH PERSON

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:52.974

SEE TO FOR LIKE THIS SERVICE

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.177
TODAY UNDER. THE PURSE. IF IT

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:57.912
HAD PLAN OF WE COULD LIVE.

01:21:57.979 --> 01:21:59.748
BILLIONS OF LAWSUITS. PER DAY-

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:00.949
AND I DON'T KNOW THE WORK. TO

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:02.284
HANDLE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT A

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.786
SOLUTION BEYOND ABOUT

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:06.688
ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU

UNDERLYING POINT AROUND THE

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:18.967
FIRST AMENDMENT I THINK MIGHT

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.436
BE HELPFUL FOR FRAMING THE

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:26.074
CONVERSATION I- THE IRAQ IT

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:26.908
GETS AT THE ALSO THE SAFE

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:28.410
HARBOR PROVISIONS IN SECTION

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:31.146
TWO THIRTY BUT- TO BE CLEAR.

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:32.981
CERTAIN KINDS OF SPEECH ARE NOT

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.015
PROTECTED WE'VE TALKED A LOT

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.717
ABOUT THE SPEECH THE A POOR

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.352
INTER AWFUL SPEECH THAT IS

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:41.289
LAWFUL- BUT- THREATS OF

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:44.159
VIOLENCE. ARE NOT

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:47.228
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED- I

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:48.530
CAN CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:51.032
BIT MORE IN IN JUST IN THAT

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:54.803
PARTICULAR CONTEXT- WHAT

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:58.840
CONSTITUTES- AT BOND AB RIGHT

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.975
SPEECH THAT ISN'T

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:01.576
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED IN

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:06.181
THAT CONTEXT. WHAT KIND OF

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:08.316
THREAT IT HAS TO BE TO BE

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:14.389
CONSIDERED- UNPROTECTED SPEECH.

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:16.491
SO I CAN SPEAK TO THIS I MEAN

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:19.627
THAT THE- UNDERLYING-

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:21.763
BRANDENBURG STANDARD FROM THE

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.598
SUPREME COURT INVOLVES ASKING

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:26.134
QUITE THERE THE THREATS CREATES

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:31.673
AN IMMINENT RISK OF HARM- AND-

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.174
I AM I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN THE

01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:34.242
DETAILS OF THAT SORT OF

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:35.243
SUBSEQUENT CASE LAW

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.945
INTERPRETING THAT BUT SOMETHING

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:38.613
THAT I THINK IS REALLY RELEVANT

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.782
FOR. THIS DISCUSSION AND WHICH

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:42.684
I THOUGHT ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IS

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:45.954
YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT EIGHT

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:49.557
THE RATS THAT IS LEGAL WHEN

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:51.693
MADE MAYBE IN A BAR BECAUSE

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.027
NOBODY BELIEVES THE SPEAKER'S

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:56.131
GOING TO ACT ON IT MIGHT BECOME

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:57.799
ILLEGAL ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.734
PERMISSIBLE TO RESTRICT WHEN

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:02.137
DISSEMINATED ON THE INTERNET IN

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:04.038
A WAY THAT MIGHT LEAD TO MOB

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:06.975
VIOLENCE OR LEAD TO- I'M

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.144
MENTALLY UNSTABLE PEOPLE THE

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:10.645
PERSON BEING MOTIVATED BAITED

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.013
BY IT AND TAKING ACTION.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.481
THERE'S A PROFESSOR NAMED

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:14.682
LARISSA LET'S SEE WHO'S WHO'S

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:17.452
WRITTEN REALLY. ON ON THIS

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:21.389
QUESTION- AND I THINK THE

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:24.159
BOTTOM LINE IS. MAYBE I. GOT TO

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:25.460
BOTTOM LINE AND I APOLOGIZE

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:26.828
BUT- I THINK IT IS QUITE

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.830
POSSIBLE THAT AND SORT OF CASE

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:31.266
BY CASE BASIS- COURTS COULD

01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:33.868
LOOK AT INSTANCES OF ONLINE

01:24:33.935 --> 01:24:37.338
THREATS- AND- RESTRICT THE MORE

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:38.106
THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE RESTRICTED

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:40.041
THAT THREAT IN A BAR ROOMS. BUT

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:42.010
I DON'T THINK THAT TRANSLATES

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:43.578
TO IT LIKE A CONSTITUTIONALLY

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:48.483
PERMISSIBLE STRUCTURE WHERE-

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.718
PLATFORMS WRITTEN LARGE ARE

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:53.021
REQUIRED TO PROHIBIT A WHOLE

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.889
CLASS OF SPEECH THAT CURRENTLY

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:56.291
LEGAL YOU KNOW BEFORE WE MOVE

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:57.859
THE LINE FROM WHAT THE LAW

FEDERAL RESOURCES- IN CASE OF

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES AND THAT NO

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:13.781
ACTION IS TAKEN. I THINK IN THE

WORLD OF GOING YOU KNOW HOLDING

MOTION- THAT SAID I'M I DIDN'T.

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:24.692
PUT IN MIND OF A SUPREME COURT

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:25.860
CASE FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:28.629
CALLED ALONENESS- WHICH WAS-

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:31.499
PROSECUTING A MAN WHO POSTED

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:32.667
THREATS TO HIS EX WIFE ON

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:35.436
FACEBOOK- INCLUDE IN THE FORM

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:37.038
OF RAP LYRICS AND- BEING

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:41.976
COLLUDED THINGS. LIKE AND

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.478
PARAPHRASING BUT- FULL UP THAT

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:44.345
TEMPER RISK ORDER PUT IT IN

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:46.147
EUROPE. DO YOU THINK IT WILL

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.050
STOP A BULLET- AND STATEMENTS

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:51.419
ABOUT- GOING AND SHOOTING

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:53.788
PEOPLE AT SCHOOLS REALLY REALLY

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:56.924
SCARY YOU KNOW AS A PARENT.

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:58.559
REALLY SCARY STUFF AND THE

01:29:58.626 --> 01:30:00.261
SUPREME COURT SAID NO IT IS

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:01.696
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO PROSECUTE

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:02.797
THIS GUY FOR SAYING THESE

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.999
THINGS AND SO THE LIMITS. YOU

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:08.002
KNOW ON WHAT. BUT THE LIMITS

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:11.739
THERE ARE ARE DIFFICULT. I'LL

01:30:11.806 --> 01:30:13.474
JUST ADD- THAT- THE

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:15.810
CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT WIND SOME

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:17.678
STATEMENT ONLINE IT CONSTITUTES

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:20.414
A TRUE THREAT- THAT SIGNALS A

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:23.151
PANIC IMMINENT ACTIONS THAT

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:25.820
SUPPORT CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IS

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:27.355
REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO

01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:28.756
DETERMINE AND I THINK YOUR

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:31.425
ANALOGY ABOUT- WHAT SOME MIGHT

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:33.961
SAY IN A PARK- TO SOMEONE IN

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:35.830
PHYSICAL SPACE- THERE'S AN

01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:37.698
IMMINENT- POSSIBILITY OF

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:39.333
VIOLENCE IS THE PEOPLE ARE

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.568
PHYSICALLY IN THE SAME SPACE

01:30:40.635 --> 01:30:42.603
TOGETHER- THAT ISN'T SHOWING

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:46.474
THE ONLINE WORLD- AND SO- WHAT.

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:48.409
WHENEVER WE SEE THAT LEVEL OF

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:49.610
EMINENCE THE NUMBER ONE

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:51.078
RECOURSE ALWAYS HAS TO BE WHAT

01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:52.346
IS LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A JUNE TO

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:54.615
PROTECT THE TARGETS OF THIS-

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:56.517
POTENTIALLY IMMINENT VIOLENCE-

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:57.652
AND IF WE THINK THE LAW

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:58.686
ENFORCEMENT STOP TAKING THOSE

01:30:58.753 --> 01:30:59.754
CASES IF WE THINK THAT THEY

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:01.556
DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:02.857
CARE OF THEM THEN I THINK WE

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:03.991
NEED TO ADDRESS IT ON THOSE

01:31:04.058 --> 01:31:05.493
TERMS. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.261
VERY MUCH HAND CUFFED IN THIS

01:31:07.328 --> 01:31:09.030
AREA BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:10.398
SPEAKERS HAVE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:31:10.464 --> 01:31:12.099
RIGHTS TO ESPOUSE ARE VIEWED

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.768
SEN SO THE EXAMPLE THAT MISS

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.236
TAYLOR GAVE ABOUT THESE RAP

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.971
LYRICS BEING QUOTED THAT COULD

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:18.306
VERY WELL BE THE KIND OF THING

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:19.841
THAT STARTS TO VIRGIN TO FIRST

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.609
AMENDMENT PROTECTED. SPEECH AND

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:22.810
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN BE

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:25.746
PARALYZED BY THE FACT THAT THEY

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.114
HAVE TO GET A RIGHT THEY HAVE

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:30.117
TO- ABOUT PROTECT- CITIZENS

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:31.152
FROM VIOLENCE BUT THEY ALSO

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.753
HAVE TO RESPECT THE FIRST

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.856
AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO SPEAKERS-

01:31:34.922 --> 01:31:36.791
SO I THINK THERE'S NO EASY

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:39.427
SOLUTIONS HERE IN PART BECAUSE

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:40.595
OF THE FACT THAT THIS WILL

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:42.563
ALWAYS BE FACT SPECIFIC AND THE

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:43.564
FACT THAT THINGS ARE TAKING

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:45.600
PLACE ONLINE REDUCES THE

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:46.868
LIKELIHOOD OF SOME IMMINENT

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:48.202
VIOLENCE IN A WAY THAT MAY NOT

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:50.071
BE TRUE. IF PEOPLE ARE JUST ARE

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:51.672
LEGALLY WITH AND- YOU KNOW THE

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:54.108
SWINGING RADIUS OF THEIR FEST-

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.611
HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH- IF WE

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:57.378
THINK THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:58.546
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMITMENT

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:06.254
TO THIS ISSUE I THINK WE. NEED

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:06.821
TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ON ITS

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.422
OWN TERMS. THANK YOU ARM. DOES

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:09.824
THE FOLLOWING TO SEND CORTEZ.

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:12.260
QUESTION SO THE EASING EXAM

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:16.163
FROM A VERY OLD CASE. IF ARM.

01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:17.832
AN INDIVIDUAL POSTS ON SOCIAL

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:20.167
MEDIA HEY EVERYBODY COME TO THE

01:32:20.234 --> 01:32:23.137
ABC THEATRE AND MIDWAY THROUGH

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:27.475
THE SHOW OR CONCERT. YELL FIRE.

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:28.910
AND THAT BECOMES A TREND THAT

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:33.915
BECOMES A THING AND- SOMEONE

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:35.283
TRIES TO ENJOYING THE SOCIAL

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:36.617
MEDIA PLATFORM FROM POP

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:40.621
PROMULGATING THIS ACTIVITY-

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:41.956
ISRAELI BE DONE CAN THEY BE

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:50.264
ENJOINED. I'LL START WITH MISS

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:50.731
KELLER THAT'LL TURN TO

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:57.571
PROFESSOR GOLDMAN. I'LL.

01:32:57.638 --> 01:33:01.776
SETTING ASIDE THE MUCH INTERNET

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:04.312
DEBATED QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:33:04.378 --> 01:33:06.614
SPEECH IN A CROWDED THEATER

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:10.818
EXAMPLE- I THINK YOU KNOW THE

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:12.920
CORE OF THIS QUESTION IS IF

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:15.756
THERE ARE PEOPLE ORGANIZING

01:33:15.823 --> 01:33:19.260
DANGEROUS THINGS ON ON A

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:22.229
PLATFORM- WHAT CAN BE DONE

01:33:22.296 --> 01:33:24.365
ABOUT BASS WHAT LIABILITY CAN

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.167
BE IMPOSED ON THEM I'M NOT THEM

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.335
IF THEY ARE ORGANIZING

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.803
SOMETHING THAT WILL FORESEEABLY

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.071
YOU KNOW BECAUSE REAL WORLD

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:32.340
VIOLENCE AND DAMAGING- AND-

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:33.874
THERE'S AN ACADEMIC THEM SUSAN

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.643
BENESCH WHO HAS WHAT I THINK IS

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:36.243
A REALLY USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:37.912
THIS. I WAS BECAUSE THAT

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:39.246
DANGEROUS SPEECH LOOKING LIKE

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:40.915
VERY INCORRECTLY AT WHAT SPEECH

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:45.820
FORESEEABLY- IS LIKELY TO LEAD

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:48.189
TO REAL WORLD VIOLENCE- I THINK

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:50.091
AGAIN SORT OF TO GO BACK TO THE

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:51.759
POINTS THAT BET ERIC AND I WERE

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.160
BOTH RAISING AND- IN RESPONSE

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:53.861
TO THE PREVIOUS SET OF

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.629
QUESTIONS. THE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:33:55.696 --> 01:34:00.267
THRESHOLD FOR PLAN- I'M LAWS

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:03.371
CAN ACT BECAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:05.373
REALISTIC THAT SOMETHING REALLY

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:06.073
DANGEROUS IS GOING TO HAPPEN

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:10.344
VERY SOON- THOSE. ARE VERY VERY

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:13.014
HIGH- AND THEN BEYOND THAT IF

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.915
THE IDEA IS TO PUT THE

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:17.151
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE FACEBOOK-

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:18.853
OR TWITTER OR YOUTUBE TO

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:20.955
IDENTIFY WHEN PARTICULAR SPEECH

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:23.090
HAS REACHED THAT THRESHOLD.

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:24.492
WHERE IT COULD IN FACT BE

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:28.896
LEGALLY PROHIBITED- IT IS.

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.698
UNREALISTIC I THINK TO EXPECT

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:31.799
THAT THEY WILL DO A GOOD JOB

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:34.068
THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE I

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:34.969
THINK WE CAN PREDICT WITH

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.470
COMPLETE CERTAINTY THAT THEY

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:37.938
WILL DO WHAT THEY DO IN

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:39.040
RESPONSE TO THINGS LIKE

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:40.374
COPYRIGHT TAKEDOWN NOTICES

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:42.476
WHICH IS JUST TO ERR. VASTLY ON

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:44.045
THE SIDE OF TAKING DOWN MORE

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:46.447
CONTENT THAN THE LAW REQUIRES-

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:47.848
AND WE MIGHT YOU KNOW TAKING

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:49.383
OFF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:53.054
HACKS AND PUTTING ON. YOU KNOW

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.288
FOR THE PUBLIC. HATS WE MIGHT

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:57.558
SAY THAT'S FINE. WHAT THE A

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:59.026
LITTLE BIT OF THAT CONSTANT

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:01.562
PROTECTED SPEECH- BUT AP YOU

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:02.997
KNOW THAT THE LAW ISN'T ALLOWED

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:04.665
TO TAKE OFFICE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:08.069
LAWYER HAT- BUT B. YOU KNOW I

01:35:08.135 --> 01:35:09.537
THINK UNDER THOSE STANDARDS YOU

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:13.941
WOULD LOSE BOTH- RIGHT WING AND

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:16.610
LEFT WING PROTESTS YOU WOULD

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:19.513
LOSE. PRO TRUMP HOPE PROTESTS

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.782
AND BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTEST

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:24.518
YOU WOULD LOSE- POLITICAL

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:26.921
ACTIVITY. ARE POTENTIALLY FROM

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:28.489
ALL ACROSS THE POLITICAL

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:29.924
SPECTRUM AND REALLY AFFECT THE

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:31.292
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:33.861
ONLINE WHICH SEEMS APPEALING IF

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:34.762
YOU DON'T LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:36.030
ARE ORGANIZING ONLINE OR OR

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:38.099
THINK THEY'RE DANGEROUS- AND

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:40.434
DISTURBING. IF YOU THINK IT IS

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.803
AN IMPORTANT EXERCISE OF RIGHTS

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:44.738
AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION THE

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:46.073
ABILITY OF PLATFORMS IF THEY'RE

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.575
GIVEN THAT THE OBLIGATION OF

01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:48.976
FIGURING OUT WHICH IS WHICH

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:50.244
THEY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:51.178
THAT RIGHT WHATEVER YOU THINK

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.646
RIGHT IS YOU KNOW WHATEVER ONE

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:53.447
THINKS RIGHT AS THEY'RE NOT

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.049
GOING TO GET IT RIGHT- THEY

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:57.651
WILL JUST ERR ON THE SIDE OF

01:35:57.718 --> 01:36:00.020
TAKING DOWN. A LOT. SO BUT THAT

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:01.322
THAT'S NOT QUITE MY QUESTION MY

01:36:01.388 --> 01:36:03.991
QUESTION IS. IT IMAGINE IF WE

01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:06.026
ENACT A LAW THAT SAYS WHEN YOU.

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:09.196
HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A-

01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:13.968
A RISK OF SERIOUS DANGER- AND

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:15.803
YOUR INFORMED YOU'RE THE SOCIAL

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.405
MEDIA PLATFORM YOUR TOLD HEY.

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:20.141
YOU KNOW PEOPLE AGAIN USING THE

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:22.076
EXAMPLE PEOPLE ARE NOW SHOUTING

01:36:22.143 --> 01:36:24.145
FIRES IN SHOUTING FIRE IN

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:26.280
THEATERS. AND WE THINK YOU

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:27.281
SHOULD TAKE THAT DOWN IF YOU

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:29.583
DON'T TAKE THAT DOWN. THEN

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:30.784
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELD CIVILLY

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:33.888
LIABLE I THINK YOUR ANSWER IS

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:37.291
WE CAN'T. THE RIGHT. I THINK

01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:39.793
UNDER CITY A TWO THIRTY YOU

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:45.633
CAN'T- I HAD I THINK UNDER THE

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:46.400
AND THAT YOU KNOW AS ERIC

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:47.434
MENTIONED THERE AS BECAUSE OF

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:48.402
ALL THE MENTIONED THAT THERE

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:49.436
ARE CASES THAT THAT SPEAKS OF

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:50.971
THIS THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW

01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:52.640
NOTICE SPACE THE LIABILITY OR

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:53.874
TAKING THINGS DOWN WHEN YOU

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:56.110
KNOW ABOUT IT- AND COURTS HAVE

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:57.845
HAVE REJECTED THE IMPOSITION OF

01:36:57.912 --> 01:36:59.713
THAT KIND OF LIABILITY. UNDER

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.216
CDA TWO THIRTY THEN YOU KNOW

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:03.784
SETTING TO THIRTY ASIDE IF THIS

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:05.452
IS PURELY A FIRST AMENDMENT

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:08.355
QUESTION- I THINK ULTIMATELY

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:10.024
WOULD HINGE ON WHAT KIND OF

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:13.093
KNOWLEDGE- CAN REASONABLY BE

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.528
ATTRIBUTED TO THE PLATFORM IF

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:17.231
WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE THINK

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:20.334
PLATFORMS CAN RELIABLY AND

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:23.370
ACCURATELY KNOW WHAT SPEECH IS

01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:24.672
ACTUALLY ILLEGAL AND ACT

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:26.840
AGAINST THAT SPEECH. THAT

01:37:26.907 --> 01:37:29.310
PUSHES YOU CLOSER TO BEING IN

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:30.311
THE WORLD OF A LAW THAT MIGHT

01:37:30.377 --> 01:37:32.112
BE CONSIDERED NARROWLY TALORED

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:36.951
ENOUGH TO. YOU KNOW. TO ACHIEVE

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:38.686
A COMPELLING INTEREST WITHOUT

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:39.687
HAVING A BUNCH OF COLLATERAL

01:37:39.753 --> 01:37:42.389
DAMAGE IF INSTEAD OR IF YOU'RE

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:43.958
A CO PRODUCTION IS THAT

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:45.492
PLATFORMS WON'T HAVE THAT

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.461
ABILITY TO DO A GOOD JOB

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:49.697
DISCERNING. LEGAL SPEECH FROM

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.031
ILLEGAL SPEECH AND YOU KNOW

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:52.933
ACTING ACCORDINGLY THAT GETS

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.803
YOU FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WORLD

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:57.972
OF YOU KNOW WHAT CONCEIVABLY A

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:59.373
COURT CONSIDER COULD CONSIDER

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.575
TO BE NARROWLY TAILORED- AND

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:03.277
THIS IS KIND OF THE LESSON OF

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:04.678
THIS MYTH PERSISTS CALIFORNIA

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:06.380
CASE THAT I MENTIONED. IT SAID

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:08.182
YOU CAN'T HAVE STRICT LIABILITY

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:09.650
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT ASSUME THAT

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:10.651
A BOOKSELLER IS GOING TO GO OUT

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.253
AND READ EVERYTHING ON ITS

01:38:12.319 --> 01:38:14.221
SHELVES AND THEN THE QUESTION

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:15.856
IS OKAY AND YOU KNOW AT WHAT

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:17.658
POINT TERM. KNOWING OR BEING

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:18.726
CAPABLE OF KNOWING ABOUT

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:20.361
ILLEGAL ACTION CAN YOU IMPOSE

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:22.396
LIABILITY THE CLOSEST WE HAVE

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:24.098
TO AN INTERNET CASE ON THIS AS

01:38:24.164 --> 01:38:25.266
A DISTRICT COURT CASE FROM THE

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:27.368

OUT AND WALK A BUNCH OF

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:51.759
INNOCUOUS CONTENT TO. AND SO IT

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:52.259
WAS STRUCK DOWN ON THOSE

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:54.928

THE USE OF FAKE ACCOUNTS TO

SPREAD MESSAGES. TO THE AVERAGE

01:51:45.632 --> 01:51:46.666
LAYPERSON THIS MAY SOUND

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:49.235
SIMILAR TO MISINFORMATION IN

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:49.736
FACT THEY ARE COMPLETELY

01:51:49.803 --> 01:51:52.138
DIFFERENT. IF I SAY THAT CATS

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:53.773

DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A

01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:59.145
SCIENTIST- IT'S TEN YEAR OLD

01:51:59.212 --> 01:52:01.381

STILL MISINFORMATION. AND

01:52:06.219 --> 01:52:06.753
HOPEFULLY PEOPLE CAN RECOGNIZE

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.455
THAT. IN A SENTENCE IN A

01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:11.291
SENTENCE THAT IS. BY ON. SAY IF

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:12.559
I SET UP TWO THOUSAND TAKE

01:52:12.625 --> 01:52:13.993
ACCOUNT. TO SAY THAT CUTS ARE

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.628
DORA. THE IS FAKE REGARDLESS OF

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:16.463
THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOTHING

01:52:16.529 --> 01:52:18.865
WRONG WITH ST STE. AND FACEBOOK

01:52:18.932 --> 01:52:19.999
WOULD BE CORRECT TO TAKE THE

01:52:20.066 --> 01:52:21.367
STOCKTON NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE

01:52:21.434 --> 01:52:23.002

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:27.941
MESSAGE. AND SO PEOPLE A RIGHT

01:52:28.007 --> 01:52:29.442
TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH A CONSTANT

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:32.178
OUT THERE ARE GENUINE QUESTIONS

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:33.313
ABOUT WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE I.

01:52:33.379 --> 01:52:34.948
MISS REGARDS TO MISINFORMATION

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:37.283
AND HATE SPEECH. BUT TAKEN DOWN

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:38.751
TAKE A CONCERT A RAM BY A

01:52:38.818 --> 01:52:39.586
GOVERNMENTS TO SPREAD THEIR

01:52:39.652 --> 01:52:40.753
MESSAGE IT'S NOT ABOUT A

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:42.122
SNIPPET THAT SPEECH IT IS

01:52:42.188 --> 01:52:43.656
IMPACT NECESSARY TO PROTECT

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:45.425
THAT FREEDOM. JUSTICE STOPPING

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:46.793
BALLOT BOX STUFFING IS

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:50.697
NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE RIGHT

01:52:50.763 --> 01:52:51.264
TO VOTE AND THE SANCTITY OF

01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:52.198
DEMOCRACY. I HOPE THIS IS CLEAR

01:52:52.265 --> 01:52:55.135
AND MAKE SENSE. AND SO AND SO

01:52:55.201 --> 01:52:56.936
AND SO ULTIMATELY THE

01:52:57.003 --> 01:52:58.271
DICTATORSHIPS OF TODAY ARE

01:52:58.338 --> 01:53:00.340
USING ARE USING THIS ACTIVITY

01:53:00.406 --> 01:53:02.108
TO REPRESS THE CITIZENRY IN THE

01:53:02.175 --> 01:53:03.676
SAME WAY THAT THE WARSAW PACT

01:53:03.743 --> 01:53:05.545
COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIPS.

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:07.046
BUSTING CROWDS TO STICK

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:08.348
DETECTIVES WE COULDN'T

01:53:08.414 --> 01:53:09.883
THEMSELVES AS HAVING FAR MORE

01:53:09.949 --> 01:53:11.217
SUPPORT THAN THE ACTUALLY THAT.

01:53:11.284 --> 01:53:12.785
GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON A VERY

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:14.888
SPECIFIC. THAT THEY WORKED OUT.

01:53:14.954 --> 01:53:16.523
AND SO THIS IS IN AZERBAIJAN

01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:19.192
SMALL NATION. IN IN THE

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:20.760
CAUCASUS BUT IT'S OFFICIALLY AT

01:53:26.299 --> 01:53:28.134
THIRTEEN. IT'S DEMOCRATIC IN

01:53:28.201 --> 01:53:29.936
THE SAME WAY THAT NORTH KOREA

01:53:30.003 --> 01:53:30.503
IS THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:33.606

FAKE ACCOUNTS TO HARASS THE AND

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:45.518

SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES

THEMSELVES AND THIS MAKES IT

02:01:32.485 --> 02:01:34.620
IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE CONSUMERS

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:35.988
TO MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS OR

02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:38.357
EVEN GOVERNMENTS TO STEP IN AND

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:40.192

FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH

PERSPECTIVE BUT WE HAVE A

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:11.123
BRIEF. INTRODUCTION I WORK AT

02:02:11.190 --> 02:02:12.491

WHICH IS PART OF IT AND I H. IN

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:15.294

INFORMATICS RESEARCH BRANCH

02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:18.264
WHEN I COULD IMAGINE THAT

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:19.932
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND INCLUDES A

02:02:19.999 --> 02:02:21.634

ADDITION TO OVERSEEING A

02:02:27.973 --> 02:02:30.142
PORTFOLIO OF FUNDED RESEARCH I

ALSO LET LEAD A ROBUST RESEARCH

02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:34.080
PROGRAM ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND

02:02:34.146 --> 02:02:36.148
HEALTH COMMUNICATION AND A OVER

02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:37.717
THE LAST FIVE FOUR YEARS WE

02:02:37.783 --> 02:02:39.351
HAVE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING

02:02:39.418 --> 02:02:40.319
THE SPREAD OF HEALTH

02:02:40.386 --> 02:02:42.421
MISINFORMATION RECENTLY I

02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:44.423
SERVED AS A GUEST EDITOR FOR A

02:02:44.490 --> 02:02:45.191
SPECIAL TEAM ISSUE ON THIS

02:02:45.257 --> 02:02:47.059
TOPIC FOR THE AMERICAN JOURNAL

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:49.328
OF PUBLIC HEALTH- OUR BRANCH AT

02:02:49.395 --> 02:02:51.731
NCI SUPPORTS RESEARCH THAT AIMS

02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:52.932
TO REALLY OPTIMIZE

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:54.800
COMMUNICATION TO FACILITATE.

02:02:54.867 --> 02:02:56.569
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC STE IF

02:02:56.635 --> 02:02:57.603
DECISION MAKING ABOUT THEIR

02:02:57.670 --> 02:02:58.771
HEALTH WHETHER IT'S CANCER

02:02:58.838 --> 02:03:00.773
SCREENING TOBACCO CESSATION OR

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:03.209
VACCINATION IN RECENT YEARS

02:03:03.275 --> 02:03:04.677
THOUGH OUR WORK HAS BEEN

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:06.512
COMPLICATED BY A COMPLEX AND

02:03:06.579 --> 02:03:07.646
EVOLVING SOCIAL CULTURAL

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:09.415
POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AND THE

02:03:09.482 --> 02:03:11.784
GROWTH OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS WE

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:13.886
ALL KNOW FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND

02:03:13.953 --> 02:03:17.723
OUT IT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED

02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:18.991
PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.960
STRATEGIES ARE INADEQUATE IN

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:22.628
THE FACE OF POLITICIZATION

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:23.863
POLARIZATION AND

02:03:23.929 --> 02:03:25.698
MISINFORMATION. AND WE'RE

02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:26.565
SEEING EVIDENCE OF

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:28.300
DISINFORMATION ACTORS TAKING

02:03:28.367 --> 02:03:30.269
ADVANTAGE OF A HEALTH CRISIS

02:03:30.336 --> 02:03:31.237
AND THE PUBLIC'S HEIGHTENED

02:03:31.303 --> 02:03:32.905
EMOTIONS TO FURTHER THEIR

02:03:32.972 --> 02:03:35.074
AGENDA IN FACT THERE'S BEEN A

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:36.842
LOT OF RESEARCH ON NEGATIVE

02:03:36.909 --> 02:03:38.844
EMOTIONS SUCH AS FEAR AND ANGER

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:40.946
BEING EXPLOITED TO SPREAD

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:45.851
MISINFORMATION. ESPECIALLY

02:03:45.918 --> 02:03:46.786
ABOUT VACCINES. SO THESE ARE.

02:03:46.852 --> 02:03:48.420
SUGGEST TO OUR ALLY THAT THE

02:03:48.487 --> 02:03:50.389
SPREAD OF HEALTHCARE. WILL

02:03:50.456 --> 02:03:52.491
CONTINUE BEYOND THIS PANDEMIC

02:03:52.558 --> 02:03:54.126
AND IS SOMETHING THAT PUBLIC

02:03:54.193 --> 02:03:55.628
HEALTH HAS TO WRESTLE WITH IN A

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:57.930
LONG TERM. SO MY BRIEF REMARKS

02:03:57.997 --> 02:03:58.898
WILL ADDRESS THREE BROADER

02:03:58.964 --> 02:04:00.666
POINTS WHITE HOUSE

02:04:00.733 --> 02:04:01.934
MISINFORMATION IS A CRITICAL

02:04:02.001 --> 02:04:04.236
BUT COMPLEX PROBLEM WHAT DO WE

02:04:04.303 --> 02:04:07.239
KNOW. FROM OUR RESEARCH- AND

02:04:07.306 --> 02:04:08.574
SOME KEY QUESTIONS WE NEED TO

02:04:08.641 --> 02:04:10.409
ANSWER IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:12.778
RESPOND. WE KNOW THAT TODAY

02:04:12.845 --> 02:04:14.246
SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME A

02:04:14.313 --> 02:04:15.781
PRIMARY SOURCE OF NEWS AND

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.750
INFORMATION AND USERS ARE

02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:18.918
SHARING THEIR HEALTH

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:21.287
INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE

02:04:21.353 --> 02:04:22.922
REALLY THOUGHT OF THIS AS A

02:04:22.988 --> 02:04:24.356
VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:25.758
HEALTHY FOR MANY WAYS

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:27.326
CONNECTING PATIENTS WITH

02:04:27.393 --> 02:04:29.328
SIMILAR HEALTH. CHALLENGES AND

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:31.230
OFFERING SUPPORT ONSTAGE

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:32.865
INFORMATION TO GATHER A HEALTHY

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:35.568
DIET HOWEVER THE SHARING A FULL

02:04:35.634 --> 02:04:37.536
SPENT ON PROVEN INFORMATION ON

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:38.571
SOCIAL MEDIA HAS MANY

02:04:38.637 --> 02:04:40.339
CONCERNING CONSEQUENCES FOR

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:42.308
HEALTH. IT COULD LEAD PEOPLE TO

02:04:42.374 --> 02:04:43.576
MAKE HOW HARMFUL HEALTH

02:04:43.642 --> 02:04:45.578
DECISIONS LOSE TRUST IN THE

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:47.746
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OR SPEND

02:04:47.813 --> 02:04:49.548
MONEY ON USELESS OR EVEN

02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:51.450
HARMFUL TREATMENTS. HOWEVER

02:04:51.517 --> 02:04:52.785
SOME OF THESE CONCERNS OUR

02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:54.620
ASSUMPTIONS AND WE REALLY DO

02:04:54.687 --> 02:04:59.058
NEED MORE EVIDENCE ON. THE

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:13.205
EXTENT TO WHICH. MANY. I DON'T

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:14.740
THINK DR JOE HANG ON FOR SECOND

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:20.145
THERE'S SOME INTERFERENCE OKAY.

02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:23.849
BUT IT MAY BE IT MAY BE

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:25.184
SOMETHING HITTING THE

02:05:25.251 --> 02:05:27.086
MICROPHONE YOUR MICROPHONE. NOW

02:05:27.152 --> 02:05:27.987
I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'M

02:05:28.053 --> 02:05:31.690
PUTTING MY- I PUT MY PRINT IS A

02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:34.059
SPEECH ON MY KEYBOARD AND- OKAY

02:05:34.126 --> 02:05:36.228
ALL RIGHT THANK. THANK YOU FOR

02:05:36.295 --> 02:05:37.596
IT FOR LETTING ME KNOW BECAUSE

02:05:37.663 --> 02:05:38.764
I COULDN'T TELL FROM MY END SO

02:05:38.831 --> 02:05:39.531
I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO

02:05:39.598 --> 02:05:40.900
INTERFERE WITH YOUR TESTIMONY

02:05:40.966 --> 02:05:43.168
THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU-

02:05:43.235 --> 02:05:44.670
I THINK ANOTHER BIG ISSUE IS

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:46.405
THAT THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH

02:05:46.472 --> 02:05:48.173
SHOWING THAT DISINFORMATION

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.309
CAMPAIGNS CREATE AN IMPRESSION

02:05:50.376 --> 02:05:51.710
THAT THERE'S NO CONSENSUS

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:53.379
EXISTING ON TOPICS SUCH AS

02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:55.381
VACCINES OR CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:57.082
IN FACT THIS SCIENCE IS LARGELY

02:05:57.149 --> 02:06:00.519
SETTLED. SO- IF YOU SEE THAT

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:02.388
THERE'S REALLY A SENSE OF

02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:04.623
APATHY OR CONFUSION OR DISTRUST

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:06.425
I COULD BE VERY MUCH TO IT

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:08.527
RESULT OF BEING. EXPOSED TO

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:10.362
MISINFORMATION SO PEOPLE COULD

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:12.031
END UP AVOIDING HEALTHCARE OR

02:06:12.097 --> 02:06:13.165
MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE

02:06:13.232 --> 02:06:15.134
DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR HOUSE.

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.835
ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION

02:06:16.902 --> 02:06:18.537
IS THE IMPORTANT AND THIS WAS

02:06:18.604 --> 02:06:20.673
ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED BY DAVID.

02:06:20.739 --> 02:06:22.741
MISTER SEA FREEZE COMMENT ABOUT

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:24.209
THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN REAL

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:26.578
WORLD AND ONLINE WORLD. SOCIAL

02:06:26.645 --> 02:06:28.147
MEDIA INTERACTIONS HARMFUL

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:29.982
EFFECTS ARE ESPECIALLY GREAT

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:31.951
WHEN REAL WORLD INFLUENCE

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:34.320
TRANSLATES INTO ONLINE POWER

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:36.822
FOR EXAMPLE WE SAW THIS- THIS

02:06:36.889 --> 02:06:38.390
LAST YEAR ATTEMPTS AT USING.

02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:39.959
COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS TO

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:42.127
EMBOLDEN RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:44.296
ON TWITTER HAS CONTRIBUTED TO

02:06:44.363 --> 02:06:46.098
MANY EXPERIENCING ANTI ASIAN

02:06:46.165 --> 02:06:48.701
HATE AND VIOLENCE AND I AGE WE

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:49.768
HAVE A LOT OF RESEARCH

02:06:49.835 --> 02:06:50.836
DEMONSTRATING THAT SUCH

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:52.938
EXPERIENCES HAVE DOCUMENTED

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:54.974
NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES.

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.408
FINALLY THE SPREAD OF

02:06:56.475 --> 02:06:57.810
MISINFORMATION IS A COMPLEX

02:06:57.876 --> 02:06:59.778
PROBLEM THE MORE WE GET INTO IT

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.313
THE MORE WE SEE THAT SO MUCH IS

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:03.415
NUANCED A LOT OF CONTENT IS NOT

02:07:03.482 --> 02:07:05.384
PROVABLY FALSE BUT SIMPLY

02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:07.286
MISLEADING. A BASED ON

02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:09.021
INSINUATION OR CHOICE OF

02:07:09.088 --> 02:07:11.256
VISUALS OR AT PERSONAL

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:12.758
ANECDOTES THAT ARE HARD TO

02:07:12.825 --> 02:07:15.027
REFUTE. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW VERY

02:07:15.094 --> 02:07:16.528
BRIEFLY I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE

02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:18.163
A FEW KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM

02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:20.366
RESEARCH. THERE IS A LOT OF

02:07:20.432 --> 02:07:21.867
RESEARCH ASSESSING THE ACCURACY

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:23.969
OF HEALTH. INFORMATION ON

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:25.938
VARIOUS HEALTH TOPICS TWO

02:07:26.005 --> 02:07:28.574
EXAMPLES A RECENT PAPER LOOKED

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.642
AT COMMON CANCERS- BEING

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:32.411
COVERED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:37.282
FOUND OVER 30% CONTAINED

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:38.050
MISINFORMATION AND EVEN HARM

02:07:38.117 --> 02:07:39.084
BILL INFORMATION. AND ARE

02:07:39.151 --> 02:07:40.986
CONTAIN MR. GARNER MORE ENGAGE

02:07:41.053 --> 02:07:42.187
THAN THOSE WITH ACCURATE

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:44.123
INFORMATION. ANOTHER YOUTUBE

02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:45.591
BASED ANALYSIS FOUND THAT

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:48.627
PROSTATE CANCER INFORMATION-

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:50.362
THE VIDEOS ON PROSTATE CANCER

02:07:50.429 --> 02:07:54.099
AT INFORMATION AT UP 277% THAT

02:07:54.166 --> 02:07:55.868
CONTENT BOX CONTAINED BIASED OR

02:07:55.934 --> 02:07:58.303
FALSE CONTENT- OBVIOUSLY WE

02:07:58.370 --> 02:08:00.305
DON'T NEED TO- I DON'T NEED TO

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:02.574
ELABORATE ON KOPET NINETEEN

02:08:02.641 --> 02:08:03.409
RELATED MISINFORMATION BECAUSE

02:08:03.475 --> 02:08:05.611
IT RUNS. FROM ORIGINS OF VIRUS

02:08:05.677 --> 02:08:07.346
TO PROMOTING OF- PROMOTION

02:08:07.413 --> 02:08:09.048
ABOUT IMPROVEMENT TREATMENTS.

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:10.783
SO I THINK THE IMPORTANT PART

02:08:10.849 --> 02:08:12.851
IS TO MOVE BEYOND ANALYZING

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:15.020
CONTENT TO I INVITE. TO

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:16.488
IDENTIFY MAJOR SOURCES OF

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:20.826
MISINFORMATION AND ONES THAT

02:08:20.893 --> 02:08:21.460
ARE MOST LIKELY TO COST HEART.

02:08:21.527 --> 02:08:22.694
THANK SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

02:08:22.761 --> 02:08:23.962
THE BEST PERSONALITY THE

02:08:24.029 --> 02:08:25.264
CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF

02:08:25.330 --> 02:08:26.999
INFORMATION SILOS AND ECHO

02:08:27.066 --> 02:08:28.767
CHAMBERS- WHETHER IT'S BY

02:08:28.834 --> 02:08:30.536
RECOMMENDING SIMILAR CONTENT TO

02:08:30.602 --> 02:08:32.404
WHAT USERS HAVE ALREADY SEEN OR

02:08:32.471 --> 02:08:34.106
MAKING IT EASY FOR USERS TO

02:08:34.173 --> 02:08:35.941
SELF CURATE THEIR FEET. THESE

02:08:36.008 --> 02:08:37.276
FEATURES ARE DESIGNED TO

02:08:37.342 --> 02:08:39.545
MAXIMIZE ENGAGEMENT AS WE KNOW

02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:40.612
BUT THEY DO REDUCE THE

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:42.081
LIKELIHOOD THAT INDIVIDUALS

02:08:42.147 --> 02:08:43.882
WILL BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT

02:08:43.949 --> 02:08:46.251
CONTRADICT THEIR EXISTING VIEWS

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:47.519
WHICH THEN IN THE LONG RUN

02:08:47.586 --> 02:08:49.121
MAKE. EXPOSURE TO

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:52.057
MISINFORMATION THAT MUCH HARDER

02:08:52.124 --> 02:08:53.158
TO COME BACK. SALI SOME

02:08:53.225 --> 02:08:55.027
RESEARCH SHOWING THERE ARE SOME

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:56.829
WAYS WE CAN ADDRESS IT. UP

02:08:56.895 --> 02:08:58.597
WE'VE SEEN LITERATURE ON

02:08:58.664 --> 02:09:00.199
BANKING OR CORRECTING FALSE

02:09:00.265 --> 02:09:02.434
MISINFORMATION. IN THE REALM OF

02:09:02.501 --> 02:09:04.970
HEALTH CAN BE EFFECTIVE HOWEVER

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:06.338
OUR RESEARCH AND OTHERS HAVE

02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:08.173
SHOWN THAT CORRECTIONS ARE NOT

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.908
AS EFFECTIVE WHEN THE ISSUE HAS

02:09:09.975 --> 02:09:13.345
BECOME POLARIZED AND VIEWS. OF

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:13.779
THE TOPIC HAS BECOME

02:09:13.846 --> 02:09:16.582
ENTRENCHED. ANOTHER SOLUTION IS

02:09:16.648 --> 02:09:18.383
MORE OF A LONG TERM ONE AIMING

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:19.985
AT BROADENING HEALTH LITERACY

02:09:20.052 --> 02:09:21.520
EFFORTS TO INCREASE HEALTH

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:24.089
SCIENCE AND MEDIA LITERACY FOR

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:26.258
EXAMPLE RAISING AWARENESS THAT

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:27.359
THERE ARE COMMON TECHNIQUES

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:29.228
COMMONLY USED BY AGENTS OF

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:31.597
MISINFORMATION AND

02:09:31.663 --> 02:09:32.898
DISINFORMATION. USING PUBLIC'S

02:09:32.965 --> 02:09:34.366
UNDERSTANDING THAT SCIENCE IS

02:09:34.433 --> 02:09:37.002
INHERENTLY COMPLEX AND

02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:39.638
EVOLVING- OR CONSIDERING

02:09:39.705 --> 02:09:40.873
INDUCING A HEALTHY SCRATCH

02:09:40.939 --> 02:09:42.608
SKEPTICISM TOWARDS CLAIMS THAT

02:09:42.674 --> 02:09:44.510
ARE OVERLY SIMPLISTIC IT COULD

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:46.745
ALSO HELP TO DECREASE PEOPLE'S

02:09:46.812 --> 02:09:49.348
VULNERABILITY. FINALLY WHAT ARE

02:09:49.414 --> 02:09:51.483
SOME RESEARCH NEEDED NOW WE

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:52.851
NEED RESEARCH TO INFORM

02:09:52.918 --> 02:09:54.786
MEASURES OBVIOUSLY AND I THINK

02:09:54.853 --> 02:09:56.955
A FEW I'M JUST GONNA COME AND-

02:09:57.022 --> 02:09:59.358
BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE A FEW

02:09:59.424 --> 02:10:01.293
HIGHLIGHTS HI. YES I'D LIKE TO

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:03.462
HIGHLIGHT NUMBER ONE MORE WORK

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:04.863
NEEDS TO UNCOVER THE

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:06.999
MOTIVATIONS AND TECHNIQUES

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:08.667
BEHIND MISINFORMATION EFFORTS

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:10.669
AND REFLECT THESE KNOWLEDGE IN

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:12.070
ALGORITHMICS DESIGNS AND

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:14.206
PRACTICAL CHANGES IF WE DON'T

02:10:14.273 --> 02:10:15.741
UNDERSTAND THE ROOT CAUSES OF

02:10:15.807 --> 02:10:17.976
MISINFORMATION WE WILL CONTINUE

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:19.711
TO PLAY A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE

02:10:19.778 --> 02:10:21.146
WHERE EVERY WITH EVERY PIECE OF

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:22.548
NEW MISINFORMATION THAT

02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:24.616
EMERGES. SO IN OTHER WORDS AND

02:10:24.683 --> 02:10:25.918
WE'VE PROBABLY HEARD THE SHOTS

02:10:25.984 --> 02:10:27.386
THROUGHOUT THE TESTING-

02:10:27.452 --> 02:10:29.655
TESTIFIED MONIES THAT WE NEED A

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:31.623
SYSTEMIC STRUCTURAL APPROACHES

02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:33.091
INSTEAD OF PATCHWORK BANDAID

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:35.093
SOLUTIONS I'M PART OF THIS

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.695
APPROACH INCLUDES WORK TO

02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:38.664
BETTER UNDERSTAND MOVEMENT. OF

02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:42.301
MISINFORMATION ACROSS PLATFORMS

02:10:42.367 --> 02:10:44.570
AND ACROSS DIFFERENT. LANGUAGES

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:45.704
AND SORT OF THINKING ABOUT

02:10:45.771 --> 02:10:47.906
SOCIAL MEDIA AS AN ECO SYSTEM

02:10:47.973 --> 02:10:51.877
THAT'S BOTH DECENTRALIZED. BUT

02:10:51.944 --> 02:10:52.444
INTERCONNECTED. MOREOVER WE

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:53.245
NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:54.880
CONSEQUENCES OF CONTENT

02:10:54.947 --> 02:10:56.381
MODERATION EFFORTS DONE BY

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:59.551
PLATFORMS. TO THE STATE THERE

02:10:59.618 --> 02:11:01.119
IS SO LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT

02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:03.055
OUTSIDE THE COMPANIES SO MORE

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:05.591
ACCESS TO DATA AND TRANSPARENCY

02:11:05.657 --> 02:11:07.593
WOULD ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO

02:11:07.659 --> 02:11:09.261
EVALUATE THE DIFFERENTIAL

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:11.430
EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRACTICES.

02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:12.931
IN FACT ACTUALLY MITIGATION

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:14.733
MEASURES COULD LEAD TO SOME

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.002
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:18.637
CREATING AN INFORMATION VACUUM

02:11:18.704 --> 02:11:20.372
AND WE SEEN THIS WITHOUT ONE

02:11:20.439 --> 02:11:22.307
STUDY LOOKING AT HPV VACCINE

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:24.376
INFORMATION ON PINTEREST. AFTER

02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:25.844
CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:28.780
WERE IN PLACE BOTH- CREDIBLE

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:31.650
AND NON CREDIBLE INFORMATION

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:33.185
WERE REDUCED. THE OVERALL

02:11:33.252 --> 02:11:35.320
AMOUNT OF HPV VACCINATION

02:11:35.387 --> 02:11:37.656
CONTENT WAS WAS BASICALLY ARE

02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:40.125
GREATLY REDUCED SO I THINK THIS

02:11:40.192 --> 02:11:41.893
IS ALSO A REMINDER WE CAN JUST

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:44.496
REMOVE BAD COUNT CONTENT BUT WE

02:11:44.563 --> 02:11:45.030
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE

02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:47.432
PROVIDING. EVIDENCE BASED

02:11:47.499 --> 02:11:49.334
INFORMATION ON THE SIDE- THE

02:11:49.401 --> 02:11:51.436
LAST POINT IS I THINK WE NEED

02:11:51.503 --> 02:11:53.872
TO AND I AND I AGE WE FOCUS SO

02:11:53.939 --> 02:11:55.274
MUCH OF OUR WORK ON ADDRESSING

02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:56.541
HEALTH DISPARITIES AND

02:11:56.608 --> 02:11:58.243
PROMOTING HEALTH EQUITY. SO WE

02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:59.811
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT

02:11:59.878 --> 02:12:01.747
OF EXPOSURE TO MISINFORMATION

02:12:01.813 --> 02:12:03.015
ESPECIALLY ON THE MOST

02:12:03.081 --> 02:12:05.250
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- WE

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:06.485
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONNECTION

02:12:06.551 --> 02:12:07.919
BETWEEN MISINFORMATION AND

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:09.955
HEALTH DISPARITIES IT COULD BE

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:11.256
THAT BY ENDORSING

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:13.225
MISINFORMATION AND BEHAVING IN

02:12:13.292 --> 02:12:15.260
SUCH A WAY. IN ONE COMMUNITY

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:16.595
FOR EXAMPLE WOULD ENSURE TO

02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:17.896
MIDDLE CLASS INDIVIDUALS

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:19.531
REFUSING VACCINATIONS FOR

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:21.533
CORBETT AND NOT WEARING MASKS

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.101
INDOORS COULD STILL

02:12:23.168 --> 02:12:24.870
DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT THE

02:12:24.936 --> 02:12:26.672
POOR OR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:28.240
SO YOU THINK ABOUT A VACCINATED

02:12:28.307 --> 02:12:29.775
CUSTOMER MARKET CLERK WITH

02:12:29.841 --> 02:12:31.076
CHRONIC DISEASE WORKING IN THAT

02:12:31.143 --> 02:12:33.078
AREA WITH LOW VACCINE UPTAKE

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:35.180
FOR EXAMPLES. SO MY FINAL

02:12:35.247 --> 02:12:36.515
THOUGHT TO END IS THAT

02:12:36.581 --> 02:12:37.949
MISINFORMATION IS A COMPLEX

02:12:38.016 --> 02:12:39.718
CHALLENGE AND HAS THE POTENTIAL

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:41.453
TO CAUSE GREAT HARM TO THE

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.588
PUBLIC'S HEALTH- I'M CITING THE

02:12:43.655 --> 02:12:44.890
OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL'S

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:47.726
ADVISORY. WE DO NEED A WHOLE OF

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:49.261
SOCIETY APPROACH TO

02:12:49.328 --> 02:12:50.395
SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED HIS

02:12:50.462 --> 02:12:54.700
PROBLEM. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO

02:12:54.766 --> 02:12:56.134
TAKE QUESTIONS. AND I. FOR MY

02:12:56.201 --> 02:12:58.070
SHUFFLING OF PAPER ON OVERLY

02:12:58.136 --> 02:13:00.505
WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU DR-

02:13:00.572 --> 02:13:02.507

SHOW AND THEN PERHAPS FOR

02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:19.324
MISTER SEA FREE AS WELL. EIGHT

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:20.659
EIGHT SIMILAR QUESTION THAT I

02:13:20.726 --> 02:13:23.161
ASKED OF THE PREVIOUS PANELS IN

02:13:23.228 --> 02:13:26.531
TERMS OF QUANTIFYING- OR IN

02:13:26.598 --> 02:13:27.999
SOME WAY PROVIDING SOME

02:13:28.066 --> 02:13:30.335
ESTIMATE OF THE OVERALL SOCIAL

02:13:30.402 --> 02:13:33.939
COST- DOCTOR CHOU IN THE IN THE

02:13:34.005 --> 02:13:35.741
PUBLIC HEALTH CONTEXT. ARE

02:13:35.807 --> 02:13:36.808
THERE ANY EFFORTS TO ACTUALLY

02:13:36.875 --> 02:13:39.911
SCOPE OUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF

02:13:39.978 --> 02:13:42.514
THIS MISINFORMATION- HAS BEEN

02:13:42.581 --> 02:13:44.316
ON OUR PANDEMIC AND WHAT THE

02:13:44.383 --> 02:13:46.518
ADDITIONAL COSTS ESSENTIALLY OF

02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:51.056
HAVING THESE PLATFORMS AS- AS

02:13:51.123 --> 02:13:52.824
NETWORKS FOR SUCH

02:13:52.891 --> 02:13:53.692
MISINFORMATION IN OTHER WORDS

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:56.762
THE- WITHOUT. THAT SPEED OF

02:13:56.828 --> 02:13:59.564
TRAVEL OF INFORMATION FLOW

02:13:59.631 --> 02:14:01.433
WOULD WE HAVE LOST. FEWER

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.635
PEOPLE TO COVERT AND HOW MANY

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:05.303
FEWER PEOPLE MIGHT WE HAVE LOST

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:08.073
AND HOW HOW MUCH MORE LIFE

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:08.740
MIGHT WE'VE SAVED HAVE YOU HAVE

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:11.243
YOU LOOKED INTO. THAT SORT OF

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:14.179
SCOPE OF INQUIRY. THANK YOU-

02:14:14.246 --> 02:14:15.847
FOR YOUR QUESTION- I CAN'T GIVE

02:14:15.914 --> 02:14:17.582
YOU A SPECIFIC NUMBERS

02:14:17.649 --> 02:14:19.151
UNFORTUNATELY BUT I DO WANT TO

02:14:19.217 --> 02:14:21.253
SAY THIS IS A BIG BIG AREA

02:14:21.319 --> 02:14:23.321
EMERGING AREA OF RESEARCH I

02:14:23.388 --> 02:14:24.656
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DATA AND

02:14:24.723 --> 02:14:26.057
WHAT THE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:27.759
IS TO CONNECT THE DOTS SO WE

02:14:27.826 --> 02:14:29.027
HAVE THE EVIDENCE OF

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:31.530
MISINFORMATION EXPOSURE WE CAN.

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.064
QUANTIFY YOU KNOW ON THIS

02:14:33.131 --> 02:14:35.200
PLATFORM ON THIS TOPIC THERE IS

02:14:35.267 --> 02:14:36.902
A LOT OF MISINFORMATION THIS

02:14:36.968 --> 02:14:39.504
AMOUNT. NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:41.807
MUCH THAT EXPOSURE TRANSLATES

02:14:41.873 --> 02:14:43.775
TO INDIVIDUALS BEHAVIORS-

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:45.010
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME

02:14:45.076 --> 02:14:47.512
NATIONAL DATA THE PEW DATA-

02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:49.548
TIZER FAMILY FOUNDATION AND ANY

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:51.450
OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN SAY

02:14:51.516 --> 02:14:52.851
LOOKING AT IN THE SPECIFIC

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:54.286
CONTEXT OF THIS PANDEMIC.

02:14:54.352 --> 02:14:56.221
LOOKING AT AXING HESITANCY AND

02:14:56.288 --> 02:14:58.190
MEASURING KIND OF ENDORSEMENT

02:14:58.256 --> 02:15:01.126
OF SIR TEN MINUTES AND YOU KNOW

02:15:01.193 --> 02:15:02.761
CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT A FALSE

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:04.996
CLAIMS ARE LINKED TO A

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:07.365
HESITANCY OR REFUSAL OF

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:09.768
VACCINATION- SO I DO THINK

02:15:09.835 --> 02:15:11.603
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS WE

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:13.271
CONNECT THE DOTS WHERE WE SEE

02:15:13.338 --> 02:15:14.806
THAT MISINFORMATION DUST.

02:15:14.873 --> 02:15:17.609
TRANSLATE INTO HOLES AND DOG

02:15:17.676 --> 02:15:20.078
IMPACTS AND LIVES LOST AND LYFT

02:15:20.145 --> 02:15:22.180
SAVED- BUT I DON'T HAVE

02:15:22.247 --> 02:15:23.849
SPECIFIC NUMBERS I DO THINK

02:15:23.915 --> 02:15:25.984
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:28.253
FOR US FOR US AT NIH AS WELL AS

02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:32.290
YOU KNOW MANY MANY OTHER

02:15:32.357 --> 02:15:33.458
YOU IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY

02:15:33.525 --> 02:15:35.360
NEEDED CURRENTLY ISN'T BEING

IN SUCH A WAY THAT CONTENT

02:17:28.206 --> 02:17:30.475
MODERATION IN REDUCING THE HEAT

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:31.309
RIGHT WHAT I DON'T BELIEVE

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:33.211
ANYBODY AT ANY OF THESE MAJOR

CHALLENGE HERE IS YOU KNOW HOW

02:17:58.069 --> 02:17:59.404
DO WE CHANGE THE INCENTIVE

02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:01.539
SYSTEM SO THAT. THESE

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:03.241
INCREDIBLE COMPANIES WILL

02:18:03.308 --> 02:18:05.176
ACTUALLY BE ABLE. IN THE

02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:07.812

RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:16.521
DISINCENTIVE IN IN FACT. YOU

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:19.791
TRANSPARENCY IS SO CRITICALLY

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:22.661
IMPORTANT AND WHY TRANSPARENCY

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.262
AT THE LEVEL OF AGGREGATE

02:18:24.329 --> 02:18:25.664

MILLION PEOPLE. ENDED UP IN

02:19:35.734 --> 02:19:37.202
THAT SYSTEM ACCORDING TO THESE

DOCUMENTS AND SO THAT'S JUST

02:19:39.204 --> 02:19:40.638
COMPLETELY UNTENABLE IT

02:19:40.705 --> 02:19:42.474
ESSENTIALLY MEANT THAT THESE

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:43.975

COMPLETELY FREE RIDE. AND THAT

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:57.422
THERE IS NO NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:19:57.489 --> 02:19:58.757
ENFORCE WHERE THERE WAS NO ONE

02:19:58.823 --> 02:20:01.025
FORCED ME. OF THEIR POLICIES

02:20:01.092 --> 02:20:02.894
THAT THEY HAVE SO STEP ONE IS

02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:03.762
WE NEED TO GET SOME REALLY

02:20:03.828 --> 02:20:05.463
CLEAR TRANSPARENCY ON WHAT'S

02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:07.465
ACTUALLY GOING ON. AND THEN

02:20:07.532 --> 02:20:09.067
NUMBER TWO WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT

02:20:09.134 --> 02:20:11.102
ARE THOSE BEHAVIORS WHAT ARE

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:13.271
THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF. CHANGES

02:20:13.338 --> 02:20:14.372
THAT THEY'RE MAKING TO THEIR

02:20:14.439 --> 02:20:16.641
INCENTIVE SYSTEMS AND TO THE

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:18.843
PRODUCTS THAT ACTUALLY HELP TO

02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:20.779
MITIGATE THIS HATE SO I DO

02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:23.081
THIS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE

02:20:23.148 --> 02:20:25.183
COMPANIES THEMSELVES ALL OF

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:26.785
THEM HAVE TO MEET THIS MINIMUM

02:20:26.851 --> 02:20:28.019
BAR THEY'LL ACTUALLY BE

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:30.121
INCENTIVIZED TO COMPETE ON HOW

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:32.090
WELL THEY'RE PROTECTING US ON

02:20:32.157 --> 02:20:34.025
HOW WELL THEY ARE ACTUALLY

02:20:34.092 --> 02:20:35.994
IMPROVING THEIR SYSTEMS. AND

02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:37.629
THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BE THE ONE

02:20:37.695 --> 02:20:39.731
WHO IS DOING A WORSE JOB BUT

02:20:39.798 --> 02:20:41.332
TODAY THERE'S NO INCENTIVE

02:20:41.399 --> 02:20:43.735
BECAUSE- IF I GO I'VE BEEN TOLD

02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:45.804
YOU KNOW IF ONE COMPANY GOES

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:46.805
OUT AND SAYS ONE THING THERE'S

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.540
NO INCENTIVE OR OR NEED FOR

02:20:48.606 --> 02:20:50.041
ANOTHER COMPANY TO DO THE SAME.

02:20:50.108 --> 02:20:52.744
SO THEY ALL LOOK BAD I DON'T

02:20:52.811 --> 02:20:54.746
WANT TO JUST PRESENT A FACE.

02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:56.881
AND THAT IS A PROBLEM SO I

02:20:56.948 --> 02:20:59.450
THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY AT THE

02:20:59.517 --> 02:21:07.025
CORE IF WE NEED. TO UNDERSTAND

02:21:07.091 --> 02:21:07.926

IN KEEPING PACE WITH BAD

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:12.436
ACTORS. ACCORDING TO THE COURT

02:30:12.503 --> 02:30:13.838
DETERMINED TO MISUSE OUR

02:30:13.904 --> 02:30:16.107
SERVICES- TRANSACTION HAS

02:30:16.173 --> 02:30:18.075
EVOLVED OVER TIME- FROM VERY

02:30:18.142 --> 02:30:19.810
SIMPLE TECHNIQUES SUCH AS BLOCK

02:30:19.877 --> 02:30:21.879
WEST. AND RATE LIMITING ON

02:30:21.946 --> 02:30:23.848
CERTAIN ACCOUNTS. TO MORE

02:30:23.914 --> 02:30:25.316
SOPHISTICATED AUTOMATED SYSTEMS

02:30:25.383 --> 02:30:26.917
BY MANY OF THE EARLY TECHNIQUES

02:30:26.984 --> 02:30:29.353
REMAIN IMPORTANT TOOLS I NEW

02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:30.888
ALGORITHMIC APPROACHES- THAT

02:30:30.955 --> 02:30:32.823
WHOLE SIGNALS FROM A VARIETY OF

02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:33.691
SOURCES ARE CENTRAL TODAY TO

02:30:33.758 --> 02:30:35.326
KEEP UP. THE BATTLE BETWEEN

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:37.094
SPAMMERS AND APART FROM CAN BE

02:30:37.161 --> 02:30:38.863
CHARACTERIZED AS ARMS RACE-

02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:40.431
ESTIMATES QUICKLY ADAPT TO

02:30:40.498 --> 02:30:42.366
DETECTION TECHNIQUES AND

02:30:42.433 --> 02:30:43.134
PROVIDERS MUST CONTINUALLY

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:45.102
RESPOND- OUR COMPANIES HAVE

02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:46.303
APPLIED MANY OF THE TECHNIQUES

02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:47.371
AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM

02:30:47.438 --> 02:30:49.240
PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM BEING

02:30:49.306 --> 02:30:49.807
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN THIS

02:30:49.874 --> 02:30:51.909
CONTEXT. TO OTHER FORMS OF

02:30:51.976 --> 02:30:54.612
HARMFUL CONTENT. SO I WILL JUST

02:30:54.678 --> 02:30:56.213
PAUSE TO NOTE THAT MODERATION

02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:57.715
IS MUCH EASIER FOR ISSUES AND

02:30:57.782 --> 02:30:59.450
TOPICS THAT FALL INTO AN EASY

02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:01.886
DICHOTOMY. BY FORMS OF ILLEGAL

02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:04.054
CONTENT AND EVEN- SPAM. HOWEVER

02:31:04.121 --> 02:31:05.523
INCREASINGLY ARE ONLINE

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:06.557
DISCOURSE FALLS INTO VARYING

02:31:06.624 --> 02:31:08.826
SHADES OF GRAY I'M PARTICULARLY

02:31:08.893 --> 02:31:11.228
IN AND MISINFORMATION. AND

02:31:11.295 --> 02:31:12.296
IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING

02:31:12.363 --> 02:31:14.298
VIOLATIVE CONTENT CAN BE

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:15.766
INCREDIBLY SUBJECTIVE WORK.

02:31:15.833 --> 02:31:17.067
GIVEN THE ENORMOUS VOLUMEOF

02:31:17.134 --> 02:31:18.135
CONTENT ONLINE AND THE

02:31:18.202 --> 02:31:19.170
OFTENTIMES NUANCED DISTINCTIONS

02:31:19.236 --> 02:31:20.604
ABOUT WHETHER CONTENT VIOLATES

02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:22.940
COMMUNITY STANDARDS- I IS

02:31:23.007 --> 02:31:24.108
MEMBER COMPANIES WORK HARD TO

02:31:24.175 --> 02:31:25.009
STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE

02:31:25.075 --> 02:31:26.911
BETWEEN FACILITATING SPEECH-

02:31:26.977 --> 02:31:29.046
AND MITIGATING HARM. OUR MEMBER

02:31:29.113 --> 02:31:30.147
COMPANIES RECOGNIZE THAT THEY

02:31:30.214 --> 02:31:31.282
DO NOT ALWAYS ACHIEVES THE

02:31:31.348 --> 02:31:38.322
PERFECT BALANCE- BUT THEY'RE

02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:39.457
CONSTANTLY LEARNING AND ACTING

02:31:39.523 --> 02:31:40.925
NOT GETTING THEIR APPROACHES-

02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:42.126
WE ARE BY NO MEANS FIRST- AND

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:42.660
THEY'RE ALL. BE ROOM FOR

02:31:42.726 --> 02:31:43.894
IMPROVED- WITH BILLION OF

02:31:43.961 --> 02:31:44.462
PIECES OF CONTENT EVERY DAY

02:31:44.528 --> 02:31:46.530
THERE WILL BE NO OF MISSED-

02:31:46.597 --> 02:31:47.965
INSTANCES WHERE WE- MISS CLASS.

02:31:48.032 --> 02:31:49.767
OR TO MAKE IT CHOI. ARE BOUND

02:31:49.834 --> 02:31:52.069
HAPPEN. WITH THE IMMENSE. OF

02:31:52.136 --> 02:31:54.038
CONTENT ON OUR PLATFORMS I JUST

02:31:54.104 --> 02:31:56.006
ON ONE PLATFORM ALONE IN ABOUT

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:58.142
AN HOUR THE FIRST HOUR OF THIS

02:31:58.209 --> 02:31:59.877
PRESENTATION FOR EXAMPLE. THERE

02:31:59.944 --> 02:32:00.945
WERE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO

02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:02.446
MILLION PIECES OF CONTENT

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:03.881
REMOVED FROM THE PLATFORM THAT

02:32:03.948 --> 02:32:06.116
VIOLATED RULES AND THAT'S- THAT

02:32:06.183 --> 02:32:07.284
DOESN'T SPEAK TO THE NUMBER OF

02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:08.786
DECISIONS THAT HAD TO BE MADE.

02:32:08.853 --> 02:32:10.488
ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE LAST UP.

02:32:10.554 --> 02:32:12.590
AND SO EVEN IF WE WERE NINETY

02:32:12.656 --> 02:32:14.758
NINE POINT 9% ACCURATE. THAT IS

02:32:14.825 --> 02:32:16.460
REMEMBER REMOVED NINETY NINE

02:32:16.527 --> 02:32:17.928
POINT 9% OF ALL CONTENT WE

02:32:17.995 --> 02:32:19.597
SHOULD HAVE REMOVED- AND WE

02:32:19.663 --> 02:32:22.233
LEFT AT NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF

02:32:22.299 --> 02:32:23.234
ALL CONTENT WE SHOULD'VE LEFT

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:24.835
UP. I WE WOULD STILL BE MAKING

02:32:24.902 --> 02:32:25.703
MILLIONS OF MISTAKES EVERY

02:32:25.769 --> 02:32:28.772
WEEK. AND SO I SAY THIS TO JUST

02:32:28.839 --> 02:32:30.174
REINFORCE THAT BALANCING THE

02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:32.376
JUST INTEREST IS DIFFICULT- AND

02:32:32.443 --> 02:32:33.744
ESPECIALLY SO WHEN IT COMES TO

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:37.314
MISINFORMATION ANOTHER

02:32:37.381 --> 02:32:37.815
SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIES.

02:32:37.882 --> 02:32:38.749
UNIVERSALLY X. THAT'S- OF HATE

02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:40.918
SPEECH MR. DON'T NECESSARILY

02:32:40.985 --> 02:32:42.453
EXIST AND IT CAN BE REALLY

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:44.622
DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY- AND

02:32:44.688 --> 02:32:48.225
PEOPLE WILL DISAGREE- OFTEN

02:32:48.292 --> 02:32:50.861
AND- AS TO WHAT- WHETHER IT'S

02:32:50.928 --> 02:32:52.663
ALLOWED OR NOT UNDER OUR RULES-

02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:54.665
AND EVEN IF THERE WERE- UNIFIED

02:32:54.732 --> 02:32:56.200
DEFINITIONS BUT IS OFTEN VERY

02:32:56.267 --> 02:32:57.735
DIFFICULT TO OPERATIONALIZE-

02:32:57.801 --> 02:32:59.904
THESE VALUE JUDGMENTS

02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:01.505
ESPECIALLY AT THE SCALE. BOB AS

02:33:01.572 --> 02:33:03.140
NOTED BY PREVIOUS PANELISTS A

02:33:03.207 --> 02:33:04.375
SECTION TWO THIRTY IN THE FIRST

02:33:04.441 --> 02:33:06.110
AMENDMENT ENABLE ONLINE

02:33:06.176 --> 02:33:06.977
COMPANIES THE FLEXIBILITY TAKE

02:33:07.044 --> 02:33:08.746
ACTIONS AGAINST HARMFUL AND

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:10.114
ILLEGAL CONTENT WITHOUT HAVING

02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:11.081
TO CHASE SIGNIFICANT

02:33:11.148 --> 02:33:12.616
LITIGATION. OR REGULATORY

02:33:12.683 --> 02:33:14.318
BURDENS WHICH WOULD DISCOURAGE

02:33:14.385 --> 02:33:16.287
INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT. AND

02:33:16.353 --> 02:33:17.054
THOSE INVESTMENTS WOULD

02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:18.856
CONTINUE MAKING THE INTERNET A

02:33:18.923 --> 02:33:19.623
BETTER SAFER EXPERIENCE FOR

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.191
EVERYONE. IN THIS FLEXIBILITY

02:33:21.258 --> 02:33:22.826
ISSUE TO COMBAT IN CONSTANTLY

02:33:22.893 --> 02:33:25.429
EVOLVING- THREATS AND SO WITH

02:33:25.496 --> 02:33:27.197
THAT IN MIND I WOULD LIKE TO

02:33:27.264 --> 02:33:29.133
DISCUSS A FEW CONSIDERATIONS

FOR THIS COMMITTEE- IT'S BEEN

02:33:30.834 --> 02:33:31.702
MENTIONED ALREADY BUT

TRANSPARENCY REPORTING THIS IS

02:33:33.571 --> 02:33:35.339
JUST ONE ISSUE WITH AND CONCEPT

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:35.940
MODERATION THAT THIS COMMITTEE

02:33:36.006 --> 02:33:37.508
HAS CONSIDERED- IN THIS

02:33:37.575 --> 02:33:39.577
LEGISLATIVE SESSION- AND MANY

02:33:39.643 --> 02:33:41.045
OF OUR PLATFORMS RECOGNIZE THE

02:33:41.111 --> 02:33:42.212
BENEFIT. OF INCREASED

02:33:42.279 --> 02:33:44.114
TRANSPARENCY. ABOUT THEIR

02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:46.083
CONTENT MODERATION EFFORTS- AND

02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:47.318
ALREADY REALLY SUBSTANTIAL

02:33:47.384 --> 02:33:49.119
TRANSPARENCY REPORTS AND HERE

02:33:49.186 --> 02:33:51.121
LIKE TO PAUSE AND JUST- SHARE A

A LOT OF THEM INCORPORATE CRAFT

02:35:46.003 --> 02:35:47.137
SOME OF THEM ARE ARE MORE

02:35:47.204 --> 02:35:49.139
INTERACTIVE THAN OTHERS BUT- WE

02:35:49.206 --> 02:35:51.308

CONTINUING NOT OUT FOR- I WILL

02:36:01.485 --> 02:36:03.387
DISCUSSION THAT YOU KNOW

02:36:03.454 --> 02:36:04.788
OFTENTIMES ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:36:04.855 --> 02:36:07.658
BROUGH- LEAD TO SOME. ISSUES AS

02:36:07.725 --> 02:36:15.933
FAR. AS THE INFORMATION THAT'S

02:36:15.999 --> 02:36:17.067
THAT'S PRESENTED- COME HAVE

02:36:17.134 --> 02:36:18.135
VERY DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES AS

02:36:18.202 --> 02:36:19.369
FAR AS- THE RESOURCE THAT THEY

HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THESE F.

02:36:21.138 --> 02:36:22.172
AND ALSO TRYING TO COME. ACROSS

02:36:22.239 --> 02:36:23.741
PLATFORM CAN ALSO BE TRICK AND

02:36:23.807 --> 02:36:25.542
MAY LEAD TO- SOME FIRST. AS FAR

02:36:25.609 --> 02:36:27.444

THOUGH THAT WE'VE BEEN WARY OF-

02:36:32.816 --> 02:36:34.384
PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

02:36:34.451 --> 02:36:35.719
COULD FORCE US TO DISCLOSE TOO

02:36:35.786 --> 02:36:37.454

02:38:55.225 --> 02:38:57.995
THIS- SO I WOULD LIKE TO TALK

02:38:58.061 --> 02:38:59.696
TO YOU ABOUT- ARE WHAT

02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:01.698
REPRESENTS THE CONSENSUS VIEW

02:39:01.765 --> 02:39:03.700
OF OUR COMMUNITY- OF INTEGRITY

02:39:03.767 --> 02:39:05.535
PROFESSIONALS. MEANING THESE

02:39:05.602 --> 02:39:07.404
ARE ALL POINTS THAT WE HAVE MET

02:39:07.471 --> 02:39:09.406
AND DSCUSSED IN DETAIL- AND

02:39:09.473 --> 02:39:10.574
THERE'S BROAD CONSENSUS AMONG

02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:11.775
OUR MEMBERS WITHIN OUR

02:39:11.842 --> 02:39:13.477
COMMUNITY HAVE AGAIN PEOPLE WHO

02:39:13.543 --> 02:39:15.078
ACTUALLY TRIED TACKLING THESE

02:39:15.145 --> 02:39:16.914
PROBLEMS FROM WITHIN THE

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.382
PLATFORMS THEMSELVES- WE

02:39:18.448 --> 02:39:19.783
BELIEVE THAT INCREASE

02:39:19.850 --> 02:39:21.885
TRANSPARENCY. IS THE EXTREMELY

02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:23.954
VALUABLE TOOL AND WHEN

02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:25.222
EMPLOYMENT IT COMPREHENSIVELY

02:39:25.289 --> 02:39:38.201
AND WELL. THE SOCIAL MEDIA

02:39:38.268 --> 02:39:40.170
COMPANIES AND ALSO TO VALIDATE

02:39:40.237 --> 02:39:41.271
THAT AND ENSURE THAT THEY'RE

02:39:41.338 --> 02:39:42.539
USING BEST PRACTICES ARE

02:39:42.606 --> 02:39:43.707
RESPONSIBLY BUILDING OUR

02:39:43.774 --> 02:39:45.909
PLATFORMS. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE

02:39:45.976 --> 02:39:47.144
THAT THE RIGHT TRANSPARENCY CAN

02:39:47.210 --> 02:39:48.712
HELP ELEVATE THE INFLUENCE OF

02:39:48.779 --> 02:39:50.514
THE INTERNAL TEAMS THAT ARE

02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:52.249
TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE HARMS

02:39:52.316 --> 02:39:54.217
THAT OCCUR ON THE PLATFORMS-

02:39:54.284 --> 02:39:55.686
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE

02:39:55.752 --> 02:39:56.787
THINK THAT TRANSPARENCY IS A

02:39:56.853 --> 02:39:57.988
VERY IMPORTANT STEP BUT IT'S

02:39:58.055 --> 02:39:59.923
ALSO NOT THE- ONLY STOP- AND

02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:01.124
THEN YOU KNOW OUR ORGANIZATIONS

02:40:01.191 --> 02:40:02.326
DURING NEW AND THIS IS SORT OF

02:40:02.392 --> 02:40:04.294
LIKE THE FIRST CONCEPT THAT WE

02:40:04.361 --> 02:40:07.831
HAVE TACKLED. FOR PUBLIC. I'M

02:40:07.898 --> 02:40:09.733
TRANSPARENCY CAN TAKE MANY

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:12.169
DIFFERENT FORMS I'M AND ONE

02:40:12.235 --> 02:40:14.304
THING TO STRESS IS THAT WE NEED

02:40:14.371 --> 02:40:16.239
AT MANY DIFFERENT FORMS.

02:40:16.306 --> 02:40:17.841
IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENCY

02:40:17.908 --> 02:40:18.875
REQUIREMENTS TO BE VERY

02:40:18.942 --> 02:40:21.144
COMPREHENSIVE TO ENSURE THAT

02:40:21.211 --> 02:40:22.679
THERE'S NO UNINTENDED

02:40:22.746 --> 02:40:24.681
CONSEQUENCES FROM FROM VARIOUS-

02:40:24.748 --> 02:40:26.750
IN CENTER UNINTENDED INCENTIVES

02:40:26.817 --> 02:40:28.585
CREATED WITHIN THE COMPANY- WE

02:40:28.652 --> 02:40:29.886
WANT TO CREATE AN ACTUAL

02:40:29.953 --> 02:40:31.722
INCENTIVE STRUCTURE THAT YOU

02:40:31.788 --> 02:40:32.889
KNOW LEADS TO BETTER BUSINESS

02:40:32.956 --> 02:40:34.925
DECISIONS- AT LEAST CELESTE

02:40:34.992 --> 02:40:35.926
FARMS ON THE PLATFORMS AND SO

02:40:35.993 --> 02:40:36.660
WE REALLY NEED TO BE

02:40:36.727 --> 02:40:38.261
COMPREHENSIVE AND WIDE RANGING

02:40:38.328 --> 02:40:39.162
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE

02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:41.298
TRANSPARENCY NEED. TO DO THAT-

02:40:41.365 --> 02:40:42.799
SO ON THAT FRONT THERE ARE

02:40:42.866 --> 02:40:44.134
SEVERAL DIFFERENT FORMS THAT WE

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:46.103
WOULD LIKE TO SEE PLATFORMS-

02:40:46.169 --> 02:40:48.105
UTILIZE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN

02:40:48.171 --> 02:40:48.739
THEY'RE MAKING THEMSELVES MORE

02:40:48.805 --> 02:40:52.209
TRANSPARENT. THE FIRST IS

02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:53.744
AGGREGATED AND SUMMARY DATA.

02:40:53.810 --> 02:40:55.212
AND SO ON THIS IS SIMILAR TO

02:40:55.278 --> 02:40:56.813
THE TRANSPARENCY REPORTS- THAT

02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:58.215
WERE JUST SHOWN BY THE- THE

02:40:58.281 --> 02:41:00.784
PROCEEDING- SPEAKER HI AND CAN

02:41:00.851 --> 02:41:02.753
INCLUDE DATA SUCH AS- THE

02:41:02.819 --> 02:41:04.354
NUMBER OF USERS WHO WERE

02:41:04.421 --> 02:41:06.757
EXPOSED TO HARMFUL CONTENT- AND

02:41:06.823 --> 02:41:07.991
WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE

02:41:08.058 --> 02:41:09.860
FREQUENCY OF EXPOSURE SO HOW

02:41:09.926 --> 02:41:11.395
OFTEN ORDER USERS REPEATEDLY

02:41:11.461 --> 02:41:14.698
EXPOSED TO HARMFUL CONTENT. OR

02:41:14.765 --> 02:41:15.198
OUR COMMUNITY STANDARDS

02:41:15.265 --> 02:41:16.533
VIOLATING CONTENT. I'M

02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:17.968
TRANSPARENCY CAN ALSO NEEDS TO

02:41:18.035 --> 02:41:19.836
COME IN THE FORM OF CONTENT

02:41:19.903 --> 02:41:22.305
BASED DATASETS- AND SO THESE

02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:23.974
WOULD BE PUBLIC RELEASES OF

02:41:24.041 --> 02:41:25.909
CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM. AN

02:41:25.976 --> 02:41:27.110
EXAMPLE THAT WE WOULD REALLY

02:41:27.177 --> 02:41:28.311
LIKE TO SEE AND WE THINK WOULD

02:41:28.378 --> 02:41:29.379
UNLOCK A LOT OF VALUABLE

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:32.649
RESEARCH- IS A RANDOM SAMPLE OF

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:35.118
YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF

02:41:35.185 --> 02:41:36.820
IMPRESSIONS ON PUBLIC CONTACT-

02:41:36.887 --> 02:41:38.121
THIS WOULD CREATE A-

02:41:38.188 --> 02:41:40.023
STANDARDIZED DATASET- THAT

02:41:40.090 --> 02:41:41.691
EVERYONE COULD AGREE- AGREE

02:41:41.758 --> 02:41:43.527
UPON AND AS REPRESENTATIVE OF

02:41:43.593 --> 02:41:44.461
WHAT USERS ARE SEEN ON THE

02:41:44.528 --> 02:41:46.163
PLATFORM AT LEAST IN THE PUBLIC

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:48.665
CONTENT SPACE- AND INTEGRATE

02:41:48.732 --> 02:41:50.033
MORE. MORE STRUCTURED

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:51.334
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN BUT THE

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:53.737
PLATFORMS- AND EXTERNAL BECAUSE

02:41:53.804 --> 02:41:57.307
HE WORKS- WE'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE

02:41:57.374 --> 02:41:59.543
DETAILS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF

02:41:59.609 --> 02:42:00.644
ALGORITHMS THAT ARE USED ON THE

02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:01.745
PLATFORMS AS WELL AS THE

02:42:01.812 --> 02:42:03.914
OVERALL PLATFORM DESIGN. AND AN

02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:05.582
EXAMPLE OF THIS COULD BE YOU

02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:07.117
KNOW WHAT CLASSIFIERS WHAT

02:42:07.184 --> 02:42:08.485
MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ARE

02:42:08.552 --> 02:42:10.320
BEING USED IN THE RANKING OF

02:42:10.387 --> 02:42:12.889
CONTENT IN FEEDS- YOU KNOW AND

02:42:12.956 --> 02:42:13.890
IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING

02:42:13.957 --> 02:42:15.325
EXAMPLE WOULD BE YOU KNOW WHAT

02:42:15.392 --> 02:42:17.360
USER ENGAGEMENT ACTIONS ARE THE

02:42:17.427 --> 02:42:19.029
PLATFORMS TRYING TO PREDICT.

02:42:19.096 --> 02:42:21.331
AND HOW DO THOSE PREDICTIONS-

02:42:21.398 --> 02:42:24.134
CHANGE THAT THE ORDERING OF

02:42:24.201 --> 02:42:25.602
CONTENT IN THEIR FEEDS. AND

02:42:25.669 --> 02:42:27.704
FINALLY AND VERY IMPORTANTLY

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:28.705
WE'D LIKE TO SEE DETAILS AND

02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:30.240
DESCRIPTIONS OF INTERNAL

02:42:30.307 --> 02:42:31.441
COMPANY PROCESS SEATS AROUND%

02:42:31.508 --> 02:42:34.010
DECISION MAKING- AN EXAMPLE

02:42:34.077 --> 02:42:36.713
HERE COULD BE A DISCLOSURE OF

02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:38.815
THE METRICS THAT COMPANIES USE

02:42:38.882 --> 02:42:39.716
IN THEIR EXPERIMENTATION

02:42:39.783 --> 02:42:42.519
PROCESS AND FOR GOALS. SO WHAT

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:43.620
ARE THE METRICS THAT INTERNAL

02:42:43.687 --> 02:42:45.355
TEAMS ARE USING WHEN THEY MAKE

02:42:45.422 --> 02:42:47.390
DECISIONS YOU KNOW IN AB TEST

02:42:47.457 --> 02:42:48.091
WHETHER OR NOT TO SHIP A NEW

02:42:48.158 --> 02:42:50.060
FEATURE OR NOT- COMPANIES VERY

02:42:50.127 --> 02:42:52.162
REGULARLY USE METRICS- IN KEY

02:42:52.229 --> 02:42:54.564
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS- TO TELL

02:42:54.631 --> 02:42:55.899
IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SHIPPING

02:42:55.966 --> 02:42:57.701
TO FEATURE- AND WE'D LIKE TO

02:42:57.767 --> 02:42:59.102
SEE TRANSPARENCY FROM COMPANIES

02:42:59.169 --> 02:43:00.337
ON WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT

02:43:00.403 --> 02:43:01.571
THEY USED TO MAKE THOSE

02:43:01.638 --> 02:43:02.973
DECISIONS. AND WHAT ARE THE

02:43:03.039 --> 02:43:04.141
METRICS THAT THEY USED TO SET

02:43:04.207 --> 02:43:05.575
GOALS FOR TEAMS LIKE WHAT IS

02:43:05.642 --> 02:43:07.844
THE COMPANY ACTUALLY TRYING TO

02:43:07.911 --> 02:43:11.448
DRIVE- THIS WAS JUST A BRIEF

02:43:11.515 --> 02:43:13.316
TASTE LIKE. TRANSPARENCY REALLY

02:43:13.383 --> 02:43:14.451
NEEDS TO BE CAUGHT-

02:43:14.518 --> 02:43:15.519
COMPREHENSIVE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:17.787
TECHNICAL DETAILS- AND AT THE

02:43:17.854 --> 02:43:18.788
INTEGRITY INSTITUTE WE ARE A

I THINK I WAS INVITED HERE

02:44:24.754 --> 02:44:26.823
TODAY. WHICH IS AS A RESEARCHER

02:44:26.890 --> 02:44:28.892
AND A SCHOLAR AND ACADEMIC AND

02:44:28.959 --> 02:44:30.160
I THINK WHAT I REALLY KIND OF

02:44:30.227 --> 02:44:33.230
WANNA BE THE JUDICIARY

02:44:33.296 --> 02:44:34.364
COMMITTEE TO TAKE AWAY AS A

02:44:34.431 --> 02:44:36.733
SCHOOL AS A AS A SCHOLAR OF

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:39.202
TRANSLATING BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY

02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:40.870
PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGISTS

02:44:40.937 --> 02:44:43.640
AND- LAWMAKERS IN A REALLY

02:44:43.707 --> 02:44:44.841
UNIQUE TIME IN HISTORY WHERE

02:44:44.908 --> 02:44:47.043
THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF HARD

02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:49.546
TRANSLATED TRANSLATED WORK- TO

02:44:49.613 --> 02:44:51.081
FIGURE OUT HOW THESE COMPANIES

02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:52.449
WHICH ARE VERY COMPLEX AND

02:44:52.515 --> 02:44:53.850
LEARNING IN MUCH DIFFERENT WAYS

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:56.119
THAN OIL COMPANY IS OR EVEN

02:44:56.186 --> 02:44:59.055
AUTO MANUFACTURERS- TO IMPACT

02:44:59.122 --> 02:45:00.557
PEOPLE'S LIVES AND TO IMPACT

02:45:00.624 --> 02:45:03.260
THEIR RIGHTS- IN CRITICAL WAYS.

02:45:03.326 --> 02:45:05.195
AND I THINK THOSE TYPES OF

02:45:05.262 --> 02:45:06.796
UNDERSTANDINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY

02:45:06.863 --> 02:45:08.098
NECESSARY TO CRAFTING GOOD

02:45:08.164 --> 02:45:13.103
LEGISLATION- IN THE LONG TERM

02:45:13.169 --> 02:45:13.903
AND INTERVENTIONS. SO I WOULD

02:45:13.970 --> 02:45:15.405
SAID I SPENT A LOT OF TIME BOTH

02:45:15.472 --> 02:45:17.307
INSIDE. TALKING TO FORMER

02:45:17.374 --> 02:45:19.643

02:45:19.709 --> 02:45:21.544
TWITTER FACEBOOK GOOGLE YOUTUBE

02:45:21.611 --> 02:45:25.081
PINTEREST AIRBNB A LOT OF. THE

02:45:25.148 --> 02:45:27.884
MAJOR AND MINOR- FIRMS THAT

02:45:27.951 --> 02:45:30.086
TRAFFIC AND KIND OF MAKING-

02:45:30.153 --> 02:45:32.455
SPEECH AVAILABLE TO. THEM AS

02:45:32.522 --> 02:45:34.124
MOST AS MANY USERS AS POSSIBLE

02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:35.592
AND I WOULD ALSO ENDEAVOR TO

02:45:35.659 --> 02:45:37.060
FIND OUT. HOW MANY OF THOSE

02:45:37.127 --> 02:45:39.062
USERS FALL OUTSIDE THE U. S.

02:45:39.129 --> 02:45:41.665
NEVER MIND CALIFORNIA- AND SO

02:45:41.731 --> 02:45:45.035
ACTUALLY ONLY ONLY 79% OF USERS

02:45:45.101 --> 02:45:47.103
ARE BASED IN THE US. MOST OF

02:45:47.170 --> 02:45:49.706
THEM ARE IN FACT BASED. OUTSIDE

02:45:49.773 --> 02:45:52.108
OUR BORDERS AND SO I THINK THAT

02:45:52.175 --> 02:45:53.443
THAT'S JUST THE IMPORTANT THING

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:54.344
TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT AS

DISCUSSING KIND OF HOW. TO

02:45:58.748 --> 02:46:01.351
POTENTIALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON

02:46:01.418 --> 02:46:03.086
THESE PLATFORMS AND CHANGE HOW.

02:46:03.153 --> 02:46:05.121
THEY THEY RUN THEIR COMPANY IS.

02:46:05.188 --> 02:46:06.589
THAT THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE

02:46:06.656 --> 02:46:08.058
GOING TO HAVE IS NOT GOING TO

02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:09.693
JUST BE I'M ON U. S. CITIZENS

THERE ARE FACTS THAT. THAT IN

02:46:15.298 --> 02:46:17.400
CALIFORNIA HAS THAT CARRY FAR

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:20.337
OUTSIDE. ITS BOUNDARIES I'M

02:46:20.403 --> 02:46:21.905

02:50:25.949 --> 02:50:27.250
FOR THIS KIND OF GOAL. AND

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:28.217
INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO DO

02:50:28.284 --> 02:50:29.719
EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE MANDATED

02:50:29.786 --> 02:50:31.621
TO DO BY- HE'S FOUNDING

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:33.990
DOCUMENTS. I'M WE ARE GOING TO

02:50:34.057 --> 02:50:35.725
HOLD FACEBOOK ACCOUNTABLE IN A

02:50:35.792 --> 02:50:38.728
SMALL WAY- TO TRY TO MAKE THIS

02:50:38.795 --> 02:50:40.029
SPACE BETTER AND TO TRY TO GET

02:50:40.096 --> 02:50:41.364
YOU BACK SIGNALED THE HOW TO

02:50:41.431 --> 02:50:42.398
MAKE YOUR PLATFORM BETTER FOR

02:50:42.465 --> 02:50:44.834
YOUR USERS. AND THAT AND WHILE

02:50:44.901 --> 02:50:46.135
HOLDING KIND OF INTERNATIONAL

02:50:46.202 --> 02:50:48.538
HUMAN RIGHTS AND- THE STANDARD

02:50:48.605 --> 02:50:50.873
FACEBOOK'S AS FAR. SO THAT

02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:53.910
BEING SAID- THERE HAS BANNED I

02:50:53.977 --> 02:50:55.511
THINK JUST GENERALLY MUCH MORE

02:50:55.578 --> 02:50:57.213
INDEPENDENT AND MUCH MORE

02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:59.582
ROBUST THAN MANY OF US IMAGINE

02:50:59.649 --> 02:51:01.317
INCLUDING ME I WAS CAUTIOUSLY

02:51:01.384 --> 02:51:03.953
OPTIMISTIC- BUT I DON'T THINK I

02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:04.921
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT'S

02:51:04.988 --> 02:51:06.055
GOTTEN TO THIS POINT THERE'S A

02:51:06.122 --> 02:51:07.223
LOT OF INSTITUTION BUILDING

02:51:07.290 --> 02:51:08.591
THAT JUST NEEDED TO GET DONE AT

02:51:08.658 --> 02:51:10.727
LIKE A VERY FOUNDATIONAL LEVEL.

02:51:10.793 --> 02:51:12.195
OR SOMETHING OF THAT SCALE TO.

02:51:12.261 --> 02:51:14.130
PLAY EVEN HEAR APPEALS FROM A

02:51:14.197 --> 02:51:15.798
GLOBAL AUDIENCE THEY KIND OF

02:51:15.865 --> 02:51:18.368
THEY HAVE TO SELECT- CASES THAT

02:51:18.434 --> 02:51:21.504
ARE. I LIKE IT ASTRONOMICALLY

02:51:21.571 --> 02:51:23.172
LIKE AT AN ASTRONOMICAL LEAVES

02:51:23.239 --> 02:51:25.141
SMALL AMOUNTS ARE GIVEN THE

02:51:25.208 --> 02:51:26.442
AMOUNT THAT APPEALED THROUGH

02:51:26.509 --> 02:51:27.844
THEM AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY HARD

02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:29.012
WORK AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

02:51:29.078 --> 02:51:31.114
THAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SO I

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:33.349
JUST I THINK IT'S ONE EXAMPLE

02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:34.884
OF THE KIND OF EIGHT EIGHT

02:51:34.951 --> 02:51:36.719
YOURSELF REGULATORY MECHANISM

02:51:36.786 --> 02:51:37.920
BUT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE SELF

02:51:37.987 --> 02:51:39.355
REGULATORY. FACEBOOK DID THIS

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:41.557
ON ITS OWN. BUT THERE IS NO

02:51:41.624 --> 02:51:43.226
REASON THAT THIS COULD NOT BE

02:51:43.292 --> 02:51:46.195
MANDATED. BY BY GOVERNMENT IN

02:51:46.262 --> 02:51:47.597
FACT CANADA IS IN THE PROCESS

02:51:47.664 --> 02:51:49.332
OF BASICALLY WRITING A MANDATE

02:51:49.399 --> 02:51:52.135
INTO- INTO A BOX THAT WOULD

02:51:52.201 --> 02:51:54.804
REQUIRE- SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES

02:51:54.871 --> 02:51:56.105
A CERTAIN SIZE TO HAVE THIS

02:51:56.172 --> 02:51:59.142
TYPE. OF A BOARD- AND SO IT IS

02:51:59.208 --> 02:52:00.443
ONE MECHANISM OF GOVERNANCE

02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:02.211
THAT KIND OF GIVES POWER BACK

02:52:02.278 --> 02:52:03.212
TO USERS WHICH I THINK IS THE

02:52:03.279 --> 02:52:05.648
MOST IMPORTANT THING- A FOR ANY

02:52:05.715 --> 02:52:06.849
TYPE OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION

02:52:06.916 --> 02:52:08.785
TO DO. IS TO NOT NECESSARILY

02:52:08.851 --> 02:52:10.186
SPEECH THE CONTENT ITSELF BUT

02:52:10.253 --> 02:52:14.424
THE ABILITY OF THE USER

02:52:14.490 --> 02:52:15.992
CONTENT TO THAT. I WILL JUST

02:52:16.059 --> 02:52:21.998

GENOCIDE IN MYANMAR ALL. AN ACT

OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM WHICH

02:54:01.731 --> 02:54:02.231
ENDED WITH THE CAPSULE BEING

02:54:02.298 --> 02:54:03.666
STORMED. AND YET APPARENTLY

02:54:03.733 --> 02:54:07.937

NOTHING TO SEE HERE YEAH. MY

02:54:09.505 --> 02:54:10.773
ORGANIZATION THE CENTER FOR

02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:11.941
COUNTERING DIGITAL HEIGHT WAS

02:54:12.008 --> 02:54:13.776
SET UP TO DISRUPT THE WORK OF

02:54:13.843 --> 02:54:15.812
MALIGNANT ACTORS NLINE. BUT

02:54:15.878 --> 02:54:17.280
ALSO TO ACCELERATE THE MOMENT

02:54:17.346 --> 02:54:19.182
WHEN BIG TECH HAS TO FINALLY

02:54:19.248 --> 02:54:21.717
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THE

02:54:21.784 --> 02:54:23.319
FACT THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT

02:54:23.386 --> 02:54:25.922
CONNECTS FAMILIES LOVED ONES

02:54:25.988 --> 02:54:27.790
FRIENDS AND YOU COMMUNITIES OF

02:54:27.857 --> 02:54:31.494
INTEREST. IT ALSO HAS POWERED

02:54:31.561 --> 02:54:33.095
MODERN EXTREMISM. SCIENCE

02:54:33.162 --> 02:54:36.666
DENIAL HATRED. BULLYING

02:54:36.732 --> 02:54:39.402
TERRORISM A HOST OF REAL WORLD

02:54:39.468 --> 02:54:42.371
HARMS. LOOK IN THE PAST YEAR

02:54:42.438 --> 02:54:44.006
THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE

02:54:44.073 --> 02:54:46.542
FACED THREE TESTS. ONE WAS THE

02:54:46.609 --> 02:54:48.411
ELECTION MISINFORMATION THAT

02:54:48.477 --> 02:54:51.113
MOB THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION I

02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:51.681
LEAD TO THE STORMING OF THE

02:54:51.747 --> 02:54:55.785
CAPSULE. FAILED ANOTHER WAS TO

02:54:55.852 --> 02:54:57.420
DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE CRISIS

02:54:57.486 --> 02:54:58.988
MENTAL HEALTH PARTICULARLY

02:54:59.055 --> 02:55:00.356
AFFECTING OUR YOUNG WOMEN.

02:55:00.423 --> 02:55:03.893
FAILED I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:05.328
BUT I'D RATHER TRUST MY KIDS

02:55:05.394 --> 02:55:08.097
WITH PRINCE ANDREW BUT

02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:10.032
INSTAGRAM'S ALGORITHMS FRANKLY.

02:55:10.099 --> 02:55:11.701
BUT THE CALVET CONDEMNING IN

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:13.736
PARTICULAR HAS LAID BAD THE

02:55:13.803 --> 02:55:15.972
EXISTING REAL WORLD HARMS

02:55:16.038 --> 02:55:18.274
CAUSED BY ONLINE MISINFORMATION

02:55:18.341 --> 02:55:20.576
ON THE SYSTEMATIC FAILURE OF

02:55:20.643 --> 02:55:22.044
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO

02:55:22.111 --> 02:55:23.512
PROTECT THAT USES FROM THOSE

02:55:23.579 --> 02:55:25.681
HARMS. AND THERE HAS BEEN A

02:55:25.748 --> 02:55:29.752
QUANTIFIABLE DEATH TOLL.

02:55:29.819 --> 02:55:31.988
MULTIPLE STUDIES INCLUDING OUR

02:55:32.054 --> 02:55:33.556
OWN HAVE SHOWN THAT THOSE WHO

02:55:33.623 --> 02:55:35.524
ARE MOST RELIANT ON SOCIAL

02:55:35.591 --> 02:55:38.494
MEDIA FOR INFORMATION ALL MORE

02:55:38.561 --> 02:55:42.331
VACCINE HESITANT. BIG TECH IS

02:55:42.398 --> 02:55:44.700
PROVEN ITS POTENTIAL

02:55:44.767 --> 02:55:46.702
DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:55:46.769 --> 02:55:49.205
AND IT REQUIRES SCRUTINY. IN

02:55:49.272 --> 02:55:51.240
MARCH TWENTY TWENTY I PIVOTED

02:55:51.307 --> 02:55:52.808
THE SENSES RESEARCH IS AN

02:55:52.875 --> 02:55:53.910
IMPACT STUFF TO FOCUS

02:55:53.976 --> 02:55:56.379
EXCLUSIVELY ON CORONAVIRUS AND

02:55:56.445 --> 02:55:58.581
PRESCIENTLY. ANTI VACCINE

02:55:58.648 --> 02:56:00.650
MISINFORMATION ACTIVES IN THAT

02:56:00.716 --> 02:56:02.518
TIME CCH HAS REPEATEDLY

02:56:02.585 --> 02:56:04.520
DEMONSTRATED BUT THE PLATFORM

02:56:04.587 --> 02:56:06.722
SYSTEMS FOR PREVENTING THE

02:56:06.789 --> 02:56:07.123
SPREAD OF HARMFUL

02:56:07.189 --> 02:56:11.394
MISINFORMATION I'M NOT WORKING.

02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:13.062
THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE SYSTEMS

02:56:13.129 --> 02:56:15.197
THEY HAVE DESIGNED TO PREVENT

02:56:15.264 --> 02:56:17.166
THE SPREAD OF HATRED SUCH AS

02:56:17.233 --> 02:56:19.235
THE ANTI BLACK RACISM. ANTI

02:56:19.302 --> 02:56:23.940
SEMITISM MISOGYNY. IN SHORT

02:56:24.006 --> 02:56:26.509
WHAT CCH IS FOUND IS THAT

02:56:26.575 --> 02:56:27.843
PLATFORMS WHEN GIVEN THE

02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:29.345
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN MY

02:56:29.412 --> 02:56:31.714
FAILURES OR EVEN CORRECT THE

02:56:31.781 --> 02:56:33.916
HOMES THEY SAID- COMPANIES

02:56:33.983 --> 02:56:35.785
CHOOSE TO EMPLOY A PLAYBOOK OF

02:56:35.851 --> 02:56:38.354
DENY CULPABILITY DEFLECTS

02:56:38.421 --> 02:56:42.391
CRITICISM AND DELAY ANY

02:56:42.458 --> 02:56:44.660
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. WE SEE HOW

02:56:44.727 --> 02:56:46.195
MUCH THE CLASS OF THAT IN THE

02:56:46.262 --> 02:56:48.631
PAST FEW MONTHS BOTH IN THE U.

02:56:48.698 --> 02:56:51.634
K. E. I'M IN THE US WITH THE

02:56:51.701 --> 02:56:53.636
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT

02:56:53.703 --> 02:56:55.404
ON LOBBYING TO STOP REGULATION

02:56:55.471 --> 02:56:57.873
FROM HAPPENING OR AT LEAST BEND

02:56:57.940 --> 02:56:59.642
IT TO THEIR INTERESTS. IT FOR

02:56:59.709 --> 02:57:01.677
EXAMPLE PLATFORMS OFTEN CLAIM

02:57:01.744 --> 02:57:02.611
THAT THEY REMOVE HARMFUL

02:57:02.678 --> 02:57:05.047
CONTENT WHAT IS REPORTED TO

02:57:05.114 --> 02:57:06.816
THEM BUT THIS IS SIMPLY UNTRUE.

02:57:06.882 --> 02:57:08.484
ALL REGULAR ORDER IS A PLATFORM

02:57:08.551 --> 02:57:10.886
ACTION ON REPORTS OF HARMFUL

02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:13.255
HATE MISINFORMATION SHOW THAT

02:57:13.322 --> 02:57:15.424
THEY FAILED TO ACT ON AROUND

02:57:15.491 --> 02:57:16.292
EIGHTEEN TEN POSTS THAT ARE

02:57:16.359 --> 02:57:20.029
REPORTED TO THEM USING THEIR

02:57:20.096 --> 02:57:20.629
OWN TOOLS THAT BOUGHT IT LAST

02:57:20.696 --> 02:57:22.765
ON. IT'S NOT JUST VACCINE OKAY

02:57:22.832 --> 02:57:24.533
MISINFORMATION OR EVEN HATE

02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:26.202
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. ALL RECENT

02:57:26.268 --> 02:57:27.703
FAILURE TO PROTECT REPORT

02:57:27.770 --> 02:57:29.372
SHOWED THAT FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM

03:09:05.667 --> 03:09:07.202
AMPLIFYING HEAT. IT WOULD

03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:09.104
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

03:09:09.171 --> 03:09:10.706

PROTECTING USERS NOT ON HOW

THEY CAN OPTIMIZE THE MOST

03:09:16.044 --> 03:09:18.080
CORROSIVE CONTENT TO KEEP US

03:09:18.146 --> 03:09:20.082

POSSIBLE. TODAY MOST MAJOR

03:09:24.352 --> 03:09:26.221
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ONLY

OPAQUE ARBITRARY BIASED AND

03:09:35.497 --> 03:09:37.365
INEQUITABLE WHY IS THIS THE

03:09:37.432 --> 03:09:39.468
CASE. CURRENTLY SOCIAL MEDIA

03:09:39.534 --> 03:09:41.069
COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE TO NO

03:09:41.136 --> 03:09:43.171
LEGAL OR FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

03:09:43.238 --> 03:09:44.806

03:09:46.708 --> 03:09:48.810
OF SERVING AS A DEFLECTION AWAY

03:09:48.877 --> 03:09:49.611
FROM THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT

03:09:49.678 --> 03:09:51.313
CONTENT PROLIFERATES ON

03:09:51.379 --> 03:09:53.648
PLATFORMS. RECENT REVELATIONS

03:09:53.715 --> 03:09:55.317
FROM LEAKED DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT

03:09:55.383 --> 03:09:57.152
THIS ISN'T JUST A THEORY

03:09:57.219 --> 03:09:58.687
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FACEBOOK HAD

03:09:58.754 --> 03:10:00.088
AN UNANNOUNCED PROGRAM CALLED

03:10:00.155 --> 03:10:01.923
CROSSCHECK THAT ALLOWED OVER

PUBLISHED RULES AND POLICIES.

03:10:09.731 --> 03:10:10.799
THAT MEANT THAT NONE OF THE

03:10:10.866 --> 03:10:12.667

03:10:12.734 --> 03:10:14.436

ANYTHING THEY WANTED WHENEVER

03:10:22.844 --> 03:10:24.980
THEY WANTED. WE ONLY KNEW ABOUT

03:10:25.046 --> 03:10:27.082
THIS BECAUSE OF A WHISTLEBLOWER

03:10:27.149 --> 03:10:28.950
NONE OF THIS WAS DISCLOSED IN A

03:10:29.017 --> 03:10:31.019
SINGLE PLATFORM REPORT. WHAT

TO REPORT ON THEIR POLICIES AND

03:10:36.792 --> 03:10:38.727
ENFORCEMENT CONSISTENTLY. THERE

03:10:38.794 --> 03:10:40.262
ARE CLEAR ISSUES WITH THE WAY

03:10:40.328 --> 03:10:41.897
PLATFORMS CRRENTLY SHARE THE

BASICALLY THAT LAW SCORE IT

PER. OF ALL HE CON ON PLATFORM.

03:11:07.122 --> 03:11:08.657

03:11:13.395 --> 03:11:14.496
THESE NUMBERS IT'S BASICALLY

03:11:14.563 --> 03:11:15.831
INTENTIONALLY DECEPTIVE IN

THEY'RE RESPONDING TO HATE

03:11:30.078 --> 03:11:31.847
EXTREMISM AND MISINFORMATION.

03:11:31.913 --> 03:11:34.049
THIRD INFORMATION IS HARD TO

COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPARENCY WILL

03:12:21.329 --> 03:12:22.731
FINALLY CLARIFY PLATFORM

03:12:22.797 --> 03:12:24.299
POLICIES AND REPEAL DATA

03:12:24.366 --> 03:12:25.600

HIGH QUALITY DATA. NOT JUST

FORCING COMPANIES TO REVEAL

SUPPRESSING FREE SPEECH. IT IS

03:12:59.801 --> 03:13:02.537
NOT ABOUT REFORMING SECTION TWO

03:13:02.604 --> 03:13:03.638

03:13:11.513 --> 03:13:13.248
TRANSPARENCY REPORTS ARE NOT

03:13:13.315 --> 03:13:15.250

CURRENTLY MOST SOCIAL MEDIA

03:13:25.026 --> 03:13:27.495
PLATFORMS ALREADY TRACK MUCH OF

ADVANTAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA

03:13:43.345 --> 03:13:44.579
PLATFORMS IF THEY WERE MORE

03:13:44.646 --> 03:13:46.581

THESE POLICIES ARE BEING FORCED

03:18:57.759 --> 03:18:58.893
EQUITABLY AND AT SCALE. IF I

03:18:58.960 --> 03:19:00.495
CAN JUST BUY OF PROBLEM A

03:19:00.561 --> 03:19:03.598
PRETTY ANALOGY- IN APOLOGIZE

03:19:03.665 --> 03:19:05.600
FOR THAT BUT- IN LOCAL

03:19:05.667 --> 03:19:08.202
GOVERNMENT. WORK BY BY STATE

03:19:08.269 --> 03:19:10.405
LAW THERE'S A THING CALLED THE

03:19:10.471 --> 03:19:13.875
BROWN ACT WHICH- IS ABOUT

03:19:13.941 --> 03:19:15.410
TRANSPARENCY IT'S ABOUT-

03:19:15.476 --> 03:19:16.844
TRANSPARENCY THE PUBLIC IN

03:19:16.911 --> 03:19:18.146
TERMS OF THE BUSINESS OF THE

03:19:18.212 --> 03:19:19.547
LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE TO DO

03:19:19.614 --> 03:19:21.983
IT. OPENLY BUT THERE ARE

03:19:22.050 --> 03:19:25.720
CERTAIN- EXCLUSIONS TO THAT. IN

03:19:25.787 --> 03:19:29.290
AND ONE OF THEM- IT IS. WOULD

03:19:29.357 --> 03:19:32.327
YOU HAVE HER THREATS- WHEN YOU

03:19:32.393 --> 03:19:34.362

03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:37.865
KINDS OF THINGS IT'S NOT THAT.

03:19:37.932 --> 03:19:39.534
IT'S NOT THAT THE ENTITIES

03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:40.168
INVOLVED DON'T WANT TO GET TO

03:19:40.234 --> 03:19:41.869
THE BOTTOM OF IT. BUT THERE'S

03:19:41.936 --> 03:19:44.138
SORT OF A- A LIMITED VERSION OF

03:19:44.205 --> 03:19:46.174
TRANSPARENCY WORD THAT LOCAL

03:19:46.240 --> 03:19:48.409
GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWED TO TAKE.

03:19:48.476 --> 03:19:50.345
THAT CONTENT BUT TAKE THAT

03:19:50.411 --> 03:19:52.880
ISSUE I'M SORRY TAKE THE ISSUE

03:19:52.947 --> 03:19:56.217
INTO A- INTO A MORE CLOISTERED.

03:19:56.284 --> 03:19:58.453
THE LESS SAID. PRESIDENTIALLY A

03:19:58.519 --> 03:20:00.788
NON PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT AN

03:20:00.855 --> 03:20:03.257
ENVIRONMENT WHERE ELECTED

FOR PROTECTING THE PUBLIC CAN

03:20:08.863 --> 03:20:10.832
STILL. GET THAT INFORMATION

03:20:10.898 --> 03:20:12.667
THAT THEY NEED AND GET IT ON

03:20:12.734 --> 03:20:14.602
THE TABLE AND FIGURE OUT

03:20:14.669 --> 03:20:15.169
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S SOME

03:20:15.236 --> 03:20:17.405
ACTION OBVIOUS REASON FOR THAT

03:20:17.472 --> 03:20:19.040
IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO

03:20:19.107 --> 03:20:22.110

03:20:22.176 --> 03:20:26.247

RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE AN OPEN

03:20:29.050 --> 03:20:32.019
PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT. AND SO. I'M

03:20:32.086 --> 03:20:33.488
WONDERING IF THERE'S BEEN

FROM YOUR SIDE OF THINGS- THE

03:20:38.159 --> 03:20:40.628
LEAGUE- YOU KNOW OTHER ALLIES

03:20:40.695 --> 03:20:42.897
SO TO SPEAK ABOUT SOME SORT OF

03:20:42.964 --> 03:20:47.368
A HYBRID. APPROACH WHERE- YOU

03:20:47.435 --> 03:20:48.403
KNOW IT'S THAT KIND OF

03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:50.338
INFORMATION IS NOT OFF LIMITS

03:20:50.405 --> 03:20:52.507

PUBLIC UNTIL. APPROPRIATE

03:20:54.776 --> 03:20:57.512
GOVERNMENTAL. OVERSIGHT COULD

03:20:57.578 --> 03:20:58.913

03:21:05.186 --> 03:21:06.254
REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS TO

KNOW THAT WELL TRANSPARENCY

03:21:08.322 --> 03:21:09.824
ISN'T EASY IT'S CERTAINLY

03:21:09.891 --> 03:21:11.959
POSSIBLE SOMETHING'S ACTUALLY

03:21:12.026 --> 03:21:13.795
CAN AND SHOULD BE DISCLOSED TO

OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPARENCY

03:21:25.706 --> 03:21:27.208
METHODS AND MECHANISMS THAT

03:21:27.275 --> 03:21:28.576
MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

03:21:28.643 --> 03:21:30.077
SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE WE CAN

LIKE THE INSURRECTION AND YES

03:24:32.727 --> 03:24:34.762
IT'S INCREDIBLY CONCERNING

03:24:34.829 --> 03:24:36.697

MORE ACCESS TO RESEARCHERS AND

03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:56.584
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT'S

KINDS OF MEASURES. WILL FULLY

03:25:20.741 --> 03:25:21.742
OR DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO

03:25:21.809 --> 03:25:24.178
REQUIRE THE FORCE OF LAW OR

03:25:24.245 --> 03:25:24.712
SOME OTHER KIND OF PUBLIC

03:25:24.779 --> 03:25:28.783
FRAMEWORK TO. TO BRING. I GUESS

03:25:28.849 --> 03:25:29.383
INTEGRITY FOR LACK OF A BETTER

03:25:29.450 --> 03:25:32.319
WORD. YEAH I THINK- WE

03:25:32.386 --> 03:25:34.689
DEFINITELY SEE PLATFORMS TAKING

03:25:34.755 --> 03:25:37.591
STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION-

03:25:37.658 --> 03:25:39.560
YOU KNOW CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS

03:25:39.627 --> 03:25:40.327
DUE RIGHT LIKETHE MAJOR

03:25:40.394 --> 03:25:43.197
PLATFORMS HAVE- BEEN PROACTIVE

03:25:43.264 --> 03:25:45.833
IN IN DISCLOSING BOTH DATA SETS

03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:48.869
AND NUMBERS- I THINK WE NEED A

03:25:48.936 --> 03:25:50.638
LOT MORE I THINK THERE'S A LOT

03:25:50.705 --> 03:25:53.274
MORE TO BE DONE- AND SO I GUESS

03:25:53.340 --> 03:25:55.342
LIKE WE WILL SEE IF WE ARE ABLE

03:25:55.409 --> 03:25:56.911
TO GET- COMPREHENSIVE

03:25:56.977 --> 03:25:58.913
TRANSPARENCY. ON A VOLUNTARY

03:25:58.979 --> 03:26:01.415
BASIS I'M I DO THINK THATYOU

03:26:01.482 --> 03:26:02.750
KNOW ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS

03:26:02.817 --> 03:26:04.385
THAT WE ARE NOT. WE HAVE NOT

03:26:04.452 --> 03:26:05.453
SEEN EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA

03:26:05.519 --> 03:26:07.188
PLATFORM THAT WE WILL EVER SEE

03:26:07.254 --> 03:26:09.190
RIGHT- TECH TALK IS THAT IS NOT

03:26:09.256 --> 03:26:11.292
THE LAST PLATFORM THEY'LL EVER

03:26:11.358 --> 03:26:12.193
SORT OF LIKE REACH A BILLION

03:26:12.259 --> 03:26:13.961
USERS- WE SHOULD EXPECT NEW

03:26:14.028 --> 03:26:14.929
PLATFORMS TO COME UP IN THE

03:26:14.995 --> 03:26:17.131
FUTURE- AND WE SHOULD NOT

03:26:17.198 --> 03:26:19.100

BURDEN THEN TAKE THEM ON- YOU

03:27:31.038 --> 03:27:32.039

QUICKLY I KNOW IT'S A REALLY

03:27:38.512 --> 03:27:39.780
SMALL POINT BUT I JUST WANTED

03:27:39.847 --> 03:27:41.515
TO SAY AS MUCH AS CALIFORNIA

03:27:41.582 --> 03:27:44.919
WANTS TO THANK THAT BUT- HERE'S

03:27:44.985 --> 03:27:46.987
THE- AS CAL. GOES GOES THE

03:27:47.054 --> 03:27:48.622
NATION THAT ACTUALLY THE PHRASE

03:27:48.689 --> 03:27:50.257
MEETING FORTY AND IT'S ASKING

03:27:50.324 --> 03:27:51.792
GOES SO GOES THE NATION SO LIKE

03:27:51.859 --> 03:27:55.196
I JUST. THANKS PANEL ABOUT

03:27:55.262 --> 03:27:57.665
MISSING PER. JUST GOT EXTENT

03:27:57.731 --> 03:28:01.435
BETTER OUT THERE- ANYWAY. I BE.

03:28:01.502 --> 03:28:02.536
THE POINT THAT I WAS GOING TO

03:28:02.603 --> 03:28:03.571
MAKE IT YES THERE ARE KINDS

03:28:03.637 --> 03:28:04.805
THAT THERE LOTS OF DIFFERENT.

03:28:04.872 --> 03:28:06.240
THAT THE COMPANY ARE ENGAGING

03:28:06.307 --> 03:28:07.708
WITH RESEARCHERS AND SOCIAL

03:28:07.775 --> 03:28:08.843
SCIENCE RESEARCHERS- I'M

03:28:08.909 --> 03:28:12.046
LETTING ME INSIDE FACEBOOK

03:28:12.112 --> 03:28:13.247
WITHOUT AN NDA. AND ALLOW ME TO

03:28:13.314 --> 03:28:17.251
TAKE CONVERSATIONS- A VERY-

03:28:17.318 --> 03:28:18.986
UNUSUAL STEP FOR THE COMPANY OF

03:28:19.053 --> 03:28:20.588
STEAK AND HADN'T DONE NOT WITH

03:28:20.654 --> 03:28:22.923
PRETTY MUCH ANYONE BEFORE AND-

03:28:22.990 --> 03:28:24.058
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S DONE

03:28:24.124 --> 03:28:25.593
SO CENTS THERE'S A FEW

03:28:25.659 --> 03:28:26.594
REPORTERS I THINK WHO HAVE

03:28:26.660 --> 03:28:28.295
LIMITED NDAS OR SOME TYPE OF

03:28:28.362 --> 03:28:30.097
THING BUT THERE IS. THAT WAS A

03:28:30.164 --> 03:28:31.131
BIG STEP AND THE MAIN REASON

03:28:31.198 --> 03:28:32.433
THAT THEY LET ME DO THAT WAS

03:28:32.499 --> 03:28:33.734
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE

03:28:33.801 --> 03:28:34.902
OF A HUGE TRANSPARENCY

03:28:34.969 --> 03:28:36.337
INITIATIVE AND SO IS GOING TO

03:28:36.403 --> 03:28:38.639
LOOK A LITTLE BIT. SKETCHY IF

03:28:38.706 --> 03:28:40.341
THEY WANTED SOMEONE TO COME IN

03:28:40.407 --> 03:28:41.408
AND BRING TRANSPARENCY AND

03:28:41.475 --> 03:28:43.310
THEN. LIKE SADDLE THEM WITH AN

03:28:43.377 --> 03:28:45.646
NDA BUT MORE OF THAT NEEDS TO

03:28:45.713 --> 03:28:47.081
HAPPEN THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE

03:28:47.147 --> 03:28:48.883
KIND OF ANTHROPOLOGISTS LIKE

03:28:48.949 --> 03:28:50.351
KIND AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS

03:28:50.417 --> 03:28:51.585
GOING IN AND TALKING TO THE

03:28:51.652 --> 03:28:52.853
COMPANIES THAT SEEING WHAT'S

03:28:52.920 --> 03:28:54.021
HAPPENING ON THE INSIDE AND

03:28:54.088 --> 03:28:55.823
BRINGING US OUT. I DIDN'T JUST

03:28:55.890 --> 03:28:57.658
OBSERVE OF COURSE LIKE OVER THE

03:28:57.725 --> 03:28:58.592
COURSE OF A YEAR INSIDE

03:28:58.659 --> 03:29:00.861
FACEBOOK ON AND OFF. JUST

03:29:00.928 --> 03:29:03.063
FACEBOOK- AND THAT ONE TEAM I

03:29:03.130 --> 03:29:05.432
DEVELOP SOURCES I MET PEOPLE I

03:29:05.499 --> 03:29:07.568
LIKE DEVELOP PEOPLE WHO.

03:29:07.635 --> 03:29:08.636
CONTINUE TO TELL ME THINGS

03:29:08.702 --> 03:29:10.537
TODAY- THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE

03:29:10.604 --> 03:29:11.805
TYPES OF THINGS THAT I FIND

03:29:11.872 --> 03:29:14.375
FROM BY IT BUT- LAND CREDENCE

03:29:14.441 --> 03:29:15.409
TO EVERYTHING REFERENCES HOW

03:29:15.476 --> 03:29:17.611
GOING TO- COME OUT AND SAID-

03:29:17.678 --> 03:29:19.513
AND I THINK THAT THOSE TYPES OF

03:29:19.580 --> 03:29:20.314
RELATIONSHIPS ARE REALLY

03:29:20.381 --> 03:29:22.816
IMPORTANT. BETWEEN KIND OF

03:29:22.883 --> 03:29:23.918
ACADEMICS AND SCHOLARSHIP

03:29:23.984 --> 03:29:25.252
ALWAYS THAT AND JOURNALISTS TO

03:29:25.319 --> 03:29:27.321
VOICE SUDDENLY KIND OF THE EDGE

03:29:27.388 --> 03:29:29.023
OF GATEKEEPING BETWEEN THAT

03:29:29.089 --> 03:29:31.625
LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATORS AND-

03:29:31.692 --> 03:29:35.396
AND THE FIRMS SO JUST TO YOUR

03:29:35.462 --> 03:29:38.599
POINT ABOUT- LARA ADOLESCENTS

03:29:38.666 --> 03:29:45.940
WHICH IS. THAT KAIST.

03:29:46.006 --> 03:29:47.074
FACEBOOK'S BEEN IT LIKE

03:29:47.141 --> 03:29:48.175
DISTRICT OF JUST GIVES A LITTLE

03:29:48.242 --> 03:29:48.909
BIT OF CLARITY OF LIKE WHY

03:29:48.976 --> 03:29:49.977
WOULD FACE. DO SO LIKE THAT ONE

03:29:50.044 --> 03:29:50.544
OF THE REASONS THAT THEY DID

03:29:50.611 --> 03:29:51.612
SOME LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE- THE

03:29:51.679 --> 03:29:53.814
TYPE OF RESEARCH. THAT EDELSON

03:29:53.881 --> 03:29:55.849
WAS ENGAGED IN WAS BASICALLY

03:29:55.916 --> 03:30:00.587
USING A PLUGIN OR API TO. GREAT

03:30:00.654 --> 03:30:02.356
PERSONALLY. INFORMATION

03:30:02.423 --> 03:30:05.559
CONCEIVABLY FROM FACEBOOK- SO

03:30:05.626 --> 03:30:07.695
THAT THEY COULD USE THAT THEY

03:30:07.761 --> 03:30:08.929
WOULD REMOVE THE K. I. IF THE

03:30:08.996 --> 03:30:10.597
PERCENT OF VIOLENT. PATIENT AND

03:30:10.664 --> 03:30:12.232
THEN THEY WOULD TRY TO LIKE USE

03:30:12.299 --> 03:30:13.200
THAT AND THE REASON THAT

03:30:13.267 --> 03:30:15.202
THEY'RE DOING THAT. IS BECAUSE

03:30:15.269 --> 03:30:17.705
THERE IS. A FAILURE OF THE

03:30:17.771 --> 03:30:19.373
COMPANY IS TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE

03:30:19.440 --> 03:30:22.109
OF INFORMATION. ON THEIR OWN

03:30:22.176 --> 03:30:24.778
AND THERE IS A LACK OF TRUST.

03:30:24.845 --> 03:30:26.447
BETWEEN WHAT THE COMPANIES WILL

03:30:26.513 --> 03:30:28.615
PROVIDE RESEARCHERS VERSUS WHAT

03:30:28.682 --> 03:30:30.084
THEY THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE

03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:31.685
TO GET ON THEIR OWN AND I WILL

03:30:31.752 --> 03:30:32.619
SAY THAT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO

03:30:32.686 --> 03:30:34.154
BE BOTH. YOU HAVE TO HAVE

03:30:34.221 --> 03:30:35.756
PEOPLE LIKE LAUREL SAID OUT

03:30:35.823 --> 03:30:37.624
THERE SCRAPING AND SEEING

03:30:37.691 --> 03:30:39.560
WHAT'S GOING ON PEOPLE ACTUAL

03:30:39.626 --> 03:30:41.028
SPEEDS AND YOU HAVE TO CHECK

03:30:41.095 --> 03:30:42.730
THAT AGAINST WHAT THE COMPANIES

03:30:42.796 --> 03:30:44.965
ARE PROVIDING. THAT IS WHAT

03:30:45.032 --> 03:30:47.067
LIKE LITERALLY THE DEFINITION

03:30:47.134 --> 03:30:48.235
OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT COME

03:30:48.302 --> 03:30:49.436
THROUGH TWO PHASES OF

03:30:49.503 --> 03:30:52.006
TRANSPARENCY- I JUST WILL SAY

03:30:52.072 --> 03:30:53.574
REALLY QUICKLY TO YOUR POINT

03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:56.010
ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. THIS IS. A

03:30:56.076 --> 03:30:57.544
WORD THAT GETS BANDIED ABOUT IS

03:30:57.611 --> 03:30:59.646
THIS MAGIC BULLET IT IS SO

03:30:59.713 --> 03:31:01.215
COMPLICATED AND IT CHANGES

03:31:01.281 --> 03:31:02.716
MEANING ACROSS DIFFERENT

03:31:02.783 --> 03:31:05.252
CONTEXTS AND DEFERRED BALANCES-

03:31:05.319 --> 03:31:07.121
WE DO NOT EXPECT FOR EXAMPLE.

03:31:07.187 --> 03:31:08.956
THE SUPREME COURT TO TELL US

03:31:09.023 --> 03:31:10.124
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN

03:31:10.190 --> 03:31:12.259
CHAMBERS OR IN DARK

03:31:12.326 --> 03:31:14.161
CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEM.

03:31:14.228 --> 03:31:15.763
THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT

03:31:15.829 --> 03:31:17.765
WE ARE ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIKE

03:31:17.831 --> 03:31:20.000
HAVE THE PRIVACY OF THEIR IDEAS

03:31:20.067 --> 03:31:25.973
AND LIKE. AND HOW THEY MAKE

03:31:26.040 --> 03:31:27.074
DECISIONS. BUT HAVING A REAL

03:31:27.141 --> 03:31:28.609
ACTS. IN A AT THE END OF THE

03:31:28.675 --> 03:31:29.977
DAY. AND SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

03:31:30.044 --> 03:31:30.878
PUT THEIR NAME. AND REFERENCE.

03:31:30.944 --> 03:31:33.647
AND LIKE ENTIRE STATURE OF

03:31:33.714 --> 03:31:36.016
THEIR OFFICE BEHIND IS WHY WE

03:31:36.083 --> 03:31:38.986
MIGHT PUT FAITH IN THE LAW. AND

03:31:39.053 --> 03:31:40.921
THAT SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE

03:31:40.988 --> 03:31:42.222
ANYTHING CLOSE TO THAT RIGHT

03:31:42.289 --> 03:31:44.792
NOW. AND YET. THESE COMPANIES

03:31:44.858 --> 03:31:46.760
ARE GOVERNING US IN THIS WAY

03:31:46.827 --> 03:31:48.028
OVER A HAVING EVEN THOUGH THEIR

03:31:48.095 --> 03:31:49.630
PRIVATE COMPANIES I WILL SAY

03:31:49.696 --> 03:31:50.431
THEY'RE MORE LIKE A PUBLIC

03:31:50.497 --> 03:31:53.233
SQUARE. THAN ANYTHING ELSE- AND

03:31:53.300 --> 03:31:54.468
THEY ARE DOING THAT KIND OF

03:31:54.535 --> 03:31:55.569
FROM A PRIVATE PERSPECTIVE

03:31:55.636 --> 03:31:57.504
WITHOUT WITH LIMITED REPORTS

03:31:57.571 --> 03:31:58.472
FOR SOME OF THE THINGS I DO

03:31:58.539 --> 03:31:59.673
THINK THEY'VE TRIED TO GET

03:31:59.740 --> 03:32:01.075
THERE IN VARIOUS WAYS AND-

03:32:01.141 --> 03:32:02.543
SOMETIMES THEY'VE- DONE WELL

03:32:02.609 --> 03:32:04.478
AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVEN'T. AND

03:32:04.545 --> 03:32:05.746
THIS JUST NEEDS TO KEEP THIS

03:32:05.813 --> 03:32:08.715

03:36:08.322 --> 03:36:10.557
PEOPLE ARE BEING SEX TRAFFICKED

03:36:14.394 --> 03:36:17.397
IS AS JOURNALISTS HAVE RECENTLY

03:36:17.464 --> 03:36:20.367
DOCUMENTED A TYPICAL FOR

03:36:20.434 --> 03:36:24.104
DISTRIBUTORS OF ABDUCTED SEXUAL

03:36:24.171 --> 03:36:27.040
MATERIALS THESE DAYS TO IGNORE

03:36:27.107 --> 03:36:29.676
THEIR PLEAS FOR TAKING THEM

03:36:29.743 --> 03:36:33.246
DOWN DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME

03:36:33.313 --> 03:36:35.482

03:36:35.549 --> 03:36:39.353
OTHERWISE- THIS GOES ON FOR

03:36:39.419 --> 03:36:42.656
WEEKS EVEN YEARS OF IT AND IT'S

03:36:42.723 --> 03:36:45.859
ALSO FAIRLY TYPICAL OF THEM- TO

03:36:45.926 --> 03:36:48.829
REGARD FINES OR DAMAGE AWARDS.

03:36:48.895 --> 03:36:52.933

LIMITED- TO. A CENTRALLY A COST

03:36:58.305 --> 03:37:00.741
OF DOING BUSINESS. AND

03:37:00.807 --> 03:37:02.709
TYPICALLY THE DAMAGE AWARDS

03:37:02.776 --> 03:37:05.112
HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO THOSE WHO

HARMED HERE BUT ARE ONLY ONE

03:37:14.154 --> 03:37:16.790
PART OF THEM. SO WHAT HAS

03:37:16.857 --> 03:37:18.158
HAPPENED HERE IS THAT THE

03:37:18.225 --> 03:37:21.128
PURVEYORS OF THESE MATERIALS.

03:37:21.194 --> 03:37:23.029

VIOLATIONS SO THIS PROPOSED LAW

03:37:28.969 --> 03:37:32.939
COULD BRING AN END TO THAT. IT

03:37:33.006 --> 03:37:34.875
GOES BEYOND EXISTING CALIFORNIA

03:37:34.941 --> 03:37:38.145
LAW TO MENTION JUST A FEW WAYS

03:37:38.211 --> 03:37:41.114
IN WHICH IT DOES THAT- IN NOT

03:37:41.181 --> 03:37:42.949

03:37:43.016 --> 03:37:45.285
OBSCENITY MATERIALS AS THE

03:37:45.352 --> 03:37:47.587
EXISTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING LAW

FOR ADULTS IS IN CALIFORNIA.

03:37:50.424 --> 03:37:52.793
ARE THE OBSCENITY DEFINITION

03:37:52.859 --> 03:37:56.930
IT'S HARM. THAT IS THE IDEA OF

03:37:56.997 --> 03:37:59.266
HARM IS NOT PART OF OBSCENITY

03:37:59.332 --> 03:38:02.536
LAW- THE HARM USED TO MAKE THE

03:38:02.602 --> 03:38:04.771
MATERIALS FOR EXAMPLE. ARE IS

03:38:04.838 --> 03:38:06.506
COMPLETELY IRELEVANT TO ITS

03:38:06.573 --> 03:38:09.242
LEGAL DEFINITION AND ALSO IT'S

03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:10.477
WELL KNOWN THAT IT'S ALMOST

03:38:10.544 --> 03:38:13.980
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE OBSCENITY.

03:38:14.047 --> 03:38:16.750
OF SENATOR CORTEZ IS LAW IS

03:38:16.817 --> 03:38:18.952
ALSO NOT VOIDED IF THE

03:38:19.019 --> 03:38:21.388
MATERIALS WERE MADE IN A PUBLIC

03:38:21.455 --> 03:38:25.492
PLACE AS QUITE A LOT. OF THESE

03:38:25.559 --> 03:38:27.861
MATERIALS ARE ALTHOUGH BY NO

03:38:27.928 --> 03:38:29.963
MEANS ALL AND IT ALSO IS A

03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:31.665
VOIDED IF THE MATERIALS WERE

03:38:31.731 --> 03:38:36.670
EVER SENT BEFORE BY ANYONE- AS

03:38:36.736 --> 03:38:38.805
THE REVENGE PORN LAW IN

03:38:38.872 --> 03:38:41.274

03:38:41.341 --> 03:38:44.544
BILL COVERS THOSE WHO ACTUALLY

03:38:44.611 --> 03:38:47.447
HAD THE SEX IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS

03:38:47.514 --> 03:38:49.416
UNLIKE THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA

03:38:49.483 --> 03:38:51.818
DEEP FAKE LAW WHICH ONLY

03:38:51.885 --> 03:38:55.355
COVERS. THE PEOPLE IN THOSE

03:38:55.422 --> 03:38:58.758
MATERIALS WHO DIDN'T- AND THIS

03:38:58.825 --> 03:39:02.162
LAW PARTICULARLY WITH ITS

03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.796
STRONG NOTICE REQUIREMENT. WHAT

03:39:02.863 --> 03:39:04.865
MAKES THE JOB OF SOCIAL MEDIA

03:39:04.931 --> 03:39:08.335
NETWORKS AND PLATFORMS EASIER

03:39:08.401 --> 03:39:10.604
WHO SAY THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO

03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:12.839
BE SELLING THE MATERIALS

03:39:12.906 --> 03:39:14.674
MATERIALS THAT ARE COERCED OR

03:39:14.741 --> 03:39:17.777
STOLEN. OR TAKEN AWAY FROM

OR PERMISSION OF THE MATERIALS

03:39:21.882 --> 03:39:26.052
MADE ACTIONABLE BY S. B. FOR

03:39:26.119 --> 03:39:26.820
THIRTY FIVE. IT WOULD ASSIST

03:39:26.887 --> 03:39:29.256
THEM IN IDENTIFYING THOSE

03:39:29.322 --> 03:39:31.725
MATERIALS- AT THIS POINT THEY

03:39:31.791 --> 03:39:34.194
HIRE THEY SAY A LOT OF PEOPLE

03:39:34.261 --> 03:39:35.695

03:39:35.762 --> 03:39:37.497
IDENTIFICATIONS WILL THIS BILL

03:39:37.564 --> 03:39:39.699
WOULD HELP THEM. A LOT IN THAT

03:39:39.766 --> 03:39:43.136
RESPECT. IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING

03:39:43.203 --> 03:39:44.704
THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT HAS

03:39:44.771 --> 03:39:47.274
NEVER PROTECTED COERCED STOLEN

03:39:47.340 --> 03:39:50.310

MAKE THEM. THERE IS NO

03:39:58.552 --> 03:40:02.556
MOUSETRAP HERE- WHERE MEDIA

03:40:02.622 --> 03:40:05.859
PLATFORMS ARE WORRIED ABOUT

03:40:05.926 --> 03:40:08.295
BECOMING LIABLE FOR MATERIALS

03:40:08.361 --> 03:40:08.895
THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE

03:40:08.962 --> 03:40:13.199
KNOWN- WERE EITHER OF WHICH IS-

03:40:13.266 --> 03:40:15.135
PREVENTING WHICH WAS THE MAIN

03:40:15.201 --> 03:40:17.137
GOAL OF FEDERAL SECTION TWO

WHEN THAT NOTICE IS IGNORED-

03:40:27.213 --> 03:40:29.816
THAT THE STATUTORY DAMAGES

03:40:29.883 --> 03:40:31.918
START TO ATTACH. AND ANY

03:40:31.985 --> 03:40:36.189
LIABILITY CAN TAKE PLACE- IT'S

03:40:36.256 --> 03:40:38.291
ALSO AGAIN WORTH NOTICING IS

03:40:38.358 --> 03:40:44.230
THAT CHILD **** WHICH- IS ARE

03:40:44.297 --> 03:40:46.132
PROHIBITED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW

03:40:46.199 --> 03:40:49.436
AND ALSO FEDERAL LAW IS ASSUMED

03:40:49.502 --> 03:40:53.440
TO BE COERCED OR MANIPULATED OR

03:40:53.506 --> 03:40:57.043
STOLEN AND- HARMFUL. TO THOSE

03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:59.512
WHO ARE IN IT THEREFORE THERE

03:40:59.579 --> 03:41:01.081
IS NO FIRST AMENDMENT

03:41:01.147 --> 03:41:03.783
PROTECTION TO IT WHAT THIS LAW

03:41:03.850 --> 03:41:06.519
DOES IS MAKES EXPLICIT ALL

03:41:06.586 --> 03:41:09.956
THOSE ASSUMED PRECONDITIONS.

03:41:10.023 --> 03:41:12.792
FOR ADULTS AND REQUIRES PROOF

03:41:12.859 --> 03:41:16.062
OF THOSE ABUSES BEFORE ANYTHING

03:41:16.129 --> 03:41:16.630
CAN BE DONE ABOUT THE

03:41:16.696 --> 03:41:19.199
MATERIALS- AND I'D ALSO BE

03:41:19.265 --> 03:41:22.035
HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION.

03:41:22.102 --> 03:41:23.970
OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF

03:41:24.037 --> 03:41:26.239
PROTECTING CHILDREN- WITHOUT

03:41:26.306 --> 03:41:28.908
ALSO OF PROTECTING COERCED

03:41:28.975 --> 03:41:32.412
ADULTS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO

03:41:32.479 --> 03:41:34.147
NAKED AND SEXUAL MATERIALS. ARE

03:41:34.214 --> 03:41:38.218
MADE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION-

03:41:38.284 --> 03:41:41.721
I THINK AS HE IS RECOGNIZED BY-

03:41:41.788 --> 03:41:45.191
THIS LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT.

03:41:45.258 --> 03:41:48.962
THE PROBLEMS OF DIGITAL MEDIA-

03:41:49.029 --> 03:41:51.031
AND THAT IT IS PAST TIME FOR

03:41:51.097 --> 03:41:53.600
THE LAW TO CATCH UP WITH

03:41:53.667 --> 03:41:56.836
PREDATORS WHO HAVE LONG BEEN

03:41:56.903 --> 03:41:58.938
ALLOWED TO OPERATE IN THE LEGAL

03:41:59.005 --> 03:42:00.807
SHADOWS BUT ACTUALLY ON THE

03:42:00.874 --> 03:42:05.311
BRIGHT CUTTING EDGE. OF VISIBLE

03:42:05.378 --> 03:42:08.815
TECHNOLOGY. OF SEX TRAFFICKING

03:42:08.882 --> 03:42:11.217
CHILDREN AND ADULTS MOSTLY

03:42:11.284 --> 03:42:13.520
WOMEN AND GIRLS ALSO TRANS

03:42:13.586 --> 03:42:16.723
PEOPLE- REAPING GARGANTUAN

03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:20.326
PROFITS AND CONTINUING TO EVADE

03:42:20.393 --> 03:42:23.296
ACCOUNTABILITY IN WAYS THAT

03:42:23.363 --> 03:42:27.100
DAMAGE EVEN DESTROY LIVES WITH

03:42:27.167 --> 03:42:30.236
IMPUNITY. SO THIS BILL IS

03:42:30.303 --> 03:42:31.404
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THAT

03:42:31.471 --> 03:42:34.340
PROBLEM AND I'D BE HAPPY TO
