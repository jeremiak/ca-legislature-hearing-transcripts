PRESIDENT TO ADOPT A

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:13.778
COMPREHENSIVE ASSAULT WEAPONS

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:16.614

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:21.286
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT AFTER

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:23.988
THE LATEST SHOOTINGS WHERE WE

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:26.024
SAW THAT THE BOMB STOCK OF BEING

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.092
USED AND THERE WAS A CALL TO AT

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.861
LEAST BAND THAT'S IN THERE WAS A

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.296
PROMISE THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:32.197
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED ABSOLUTELY

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:34.132
NOTHING.

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:35.867
AND RAPID FIRE ASSAULT WEAPONS

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:37.802
WITH LARGE CLIPS OF AMMUNITION

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:40.238
HAVE ONLY ONE PURPOSE THE MASS

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:42.273
SLAUGHTER OF LARGE NUMBERS OF

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.042
HUMAN BEINGS.

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:45.710
THERE THESE OF WEAPONS ARE

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:48.213
DESIGNED FOR MILITARY USE TO

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.915
ACHIEVE THAT MISSION IN COMBAT.

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:52.951
FOR NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS EIGHTY

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.586
YEARS FEDERAL LAW HAS BANNED

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:57.155
MACHINE GUNS GRENADES AND BOMBS

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:58.623
OTHER WEAPONS OF WAR LIKE

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.091
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:02.126
THAT ARE SIMPLY TOO DANGEROUS TO

00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:03.861
BE IN CIVILIAN HANDS.

00:31:03.928 --> 00:31:05.096
CONGRESS PASSED AN ASSAULT

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:06.764
WEAPONS BAN THIS PART OF THE

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:07.765

ENFORCEMENT ACT IN NINETEEN

00:31:10.435 --> 00:31:11.736
NINETY FOUR BUT AS WE ALL KNOW.

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:14.072
IT EXPIRED IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:15.907
FOUR AND WAS NOT RENEWED.

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:18.042
BEFORE ITS EXPIRATION.

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:19.611
THE FEDERAL ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:20.979
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:23.348
SHOOTING VICTIMS BY FIFTY FOUR

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:24.983
POINT 4% ACCORDING TO A

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:28.019
QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY STUDY.

00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:29.988
COMPARED WITH A TEN YEAR PERIOD

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:31.756
BEFORE THE BAND WAS IN PLACE THE

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:33.291
NUMBER OF MASS SHOOTINGS DURING

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:36.594
THE BAND FELL BY 37%.

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:38.329
AND THE NUMBER PEOPLE DYING FROM

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:41.165
MASS SHOOTINGS BY 43% BUT AFTER

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:43.268
THE BAN LAPSED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:44.636
AND FOUR THE NUMBER SHOT UP

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:45.503
AGAIN.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.538
AND IT'S TARNISHING ONE HUNDRED

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.540
AND 83% INCREASE IN GUN

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:51.976
MASSACRES AND TWO HUNDRED AND

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:54.646
39% INCREASE IN DEATHS.

00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:56.314
THE ONLY GUN CONTROL MEASURE

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:58.182
THAT HAS TO HAVE A STATISTICALLY

00:31:58.249 --> 00:32:00.018
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE NUMBER

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:02.320
AND SEVERITY OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:03.888
IS THE FEDERAL ASSAULT WEAPONS

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:04.922
BAN.

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:06.758
IT'S GOAL IS TO STEM HORRIFIC

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.526
MASS SHOOTING INCIDENTS IT WON'T

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.395
STOP EVERY GUN MASSACRE WE KNOW

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:12.397
THAT BUT IT WILL CUT DOWN ON

00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:13.865
THEIR CARNAGE.

00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:15.600
IT WILL ALSO REDUCE THE PROBLEMS

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.335
OF POROUS BORDERS FOR STATES

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:19.337
LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT A PASSED

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:21.339
TOUGH GUN CONTROL LAWS AND YET

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:23.041
WITH OTHER STATES BY HAVING

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:24.108
LACKS LAWS.

00:32:24.175 --> 00:32:25.610
PEOPLE CAN SIMPLY TRANSPORT

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:27.945
THESE FIREARMS IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:32:28.012 --> 00:32:30.415
THIS HAS TO BE TAKEN ON A

00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:32.150
NATIONAL LEVEL AS WELL.

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:33.184
IN LIGHT OF THE STATISTICAL

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:34.886
SIGNIFICANCE I BELIEVE IT'S TIME

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:36.254
FOR CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:38.389
POLICIES. TO MATCH THE VIEWS OF

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:39.724
THE STATE'S CITIZENS AND TO

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:41.059
STAND UP.

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:42.660
AND START SHOULD TAKE A STAND

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:44.262
WITH THE VICTIMS OF THESE

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:46.297
HORRIFIC CRIMES CAL STIRS HAS

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:48.166
ALREADY TAKEN THE STEP OF THE

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:49.367
VESTING ITS HOLDINGS INCOME

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:50.301
MANUFACTURE.

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:53.438
PERHAPS REALIZING THE DISCONNECT

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:55.073
RETIREES INVESTMENTS AND

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:57.175
TEACHERS MISSION OF KEEPING

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.943
STUDENTS SAY FROM THE CLASSROOM.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.280
AND FURTHER AS PRESSURE IS

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:02.914
MOUNTING ON WALL STREET TO DO

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.582
SOMETHING ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE.

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:06.250
I BELIEVE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.920
TIME FOR US AS A STATE THE CALL

00:33:08.986 --> 00:33:11.289

OF WHICH ARE DROPPING GUN STOCKS.

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:19.497
AND ASKING WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:20.565
WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.200
THEIR PRODUCTS DON'T END UP IN A

00:33:22.266 --> 00:33:23.968
MASS SHOOTING.

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.503
SEVERAL MAJOR RETAILERS

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.372

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:31.194
WHEN SOMEONE DOES WALK UP WITH A

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.395
DIVESTMENT BILL I THINK THEY

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.330
NEED TO IDENTIFY --

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.465
WHERE THEY CAN GET THE DOLLARS

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:37.100
TO OFFSET THE LOSSES FOR THEIR

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.868
PROPOSAL --

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:40.470
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:41.671
A SIGNIFICANT PENSION --

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.272

TO AND THIS IS MEMBERS MONEY IT

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.077

LEGISLATURE CAN JUST TAKE AND DO

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:50.880
WHAT THEY WANT.

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:52.648
OR NOT WANT WITH --

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:53.950
BUT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:54.851
A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH I THINK

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.019
THIS IS A MORE THOUGHTFUL

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:56.919

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:11.034
RESPONSIBILITIES FUNDS GET THE

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.935

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.039
IN CALIFORNIA DIVESTITURE IS A

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.940
REALITY SAW BE SPORTING A BILL

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.209

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:30.186
PROCESSORS AT JUST THE

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:31.554
LEGISLATURE.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.589
SO THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY FOR

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:36.359
LEGISLATION SO BECAUSE BUT

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:38.728
CERTAINLY IT WITHIN THAT OF RACE

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:40.530
PENSION FUNDS --

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:43.633

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.310
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT POTENTIAL

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.312
CONSEQUENCES ARE THEY DO HAVE A

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.081
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY.

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.649
ARE UNDER LAW --

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:00.683

FOR HER SECURITY.

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.216
AND SO HE DRAGGED HIMSELF INTO

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:36.684
WORK EVERYDAY UNTIL HE REACHED

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:37.718

IN ITS STATE.

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:52.900
AND SO THE COURT HAD TO PICK UP

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.001
THE SLACK AND CERTAINLY WAS A

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.469
TRAGIC EXPERIENCE FOR HIM HIS

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:56.938
WIFE TO WONDER IF HE WOULD EVEN

01:32:57.004 --> 01:32:58.539
MAKE IT TO THAT FINISH LINE.

01:32:58.606 --> 01:32:59.540
I'M.

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:00.741
I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY MISTER

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:02.443
BOLTON'S ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:03.778
IT'S THOROUGH AT SIX IT IT

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:04.712
EXPLAINS ALL OF THE BEST

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:06.080
ARGUMENTS.

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:07.415
THE MOST IMPORTANT ARGUMENT TO

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:08.282
MAKE IS THAT UNDER THIS BILL NO

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:09.750
JUDGE GETS A DOLLAR MORE OR A

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.385
DOLLAR A DAY SOONER.

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:11.953
THAN THEY WOULD GET IF THEY

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.154
STAYED ON UNTIL FINAL RETIREMENT

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.488
AGE.

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.190
IT'S SIMPLY ALLOWS THE JUDGE TO

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:17.558
GET THE YEARS OF SERVICE THAT

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:18.759
JUDGE HAS ACTUALLY SERVED.

01:33:18.826 --> 01:33:20.728
AT A LATER DATE.

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:22.263
I AND ACTUALLY FORGO SOME

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.431
INCREASES THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE

01:33:23.497 --> 01:33:24.832
OTHERWISE RECEIVED SOME JUDGES

01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:26.534
WILL TAKE LESS SOME WILL GET THE

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.535
BENEFIT AT A LATER DATE THAT HAD

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:29.136
THEY STAYED ON THE BENCH.

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:31.205
A IT'S A VERY SMALL ASK BUT I

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:32.373
THINK IT ADDRESSES THE MOST

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.342
TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:35.276
THAT ARE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:35.876

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.078
BILL.

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:37.645
SO ICE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:39.413
BUTTONS.

AGREE THIS IS A WORTHY

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:36.303
INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE

BUT HE IS CERTAINLY CORRECT THAT

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.313
REALLY UNIQUE.

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.214
PROGRAM WITHIN --

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.617
THE STATE SYSTEM IT IS THE ONLY

01:34:49.683 --> 01:34:52.219
HYBRID PROGRAM THAT I KNOW OF

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:54.522
ANYWHERE IN PUBLIC SERVICE WHERE

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.290
YOU HAVE A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:57.558
UNTIL THE EXACT MOMENT OF

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:58.559
VESTING.

01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:00.127
AT WHICH CASE YOU CONTRIBUTE YOU

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:02.730
CHANGE TO A DEFINED BENEFIT.

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:04.231
IT ALSO IS THE ONLY SYSTEM I

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:05.699
KNOW OF THAT HAS THIS SORT OF

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:07.168
CLIFF VESTING.

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:09.203
A THAT SORT OF CLIFF VESTING IS

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:10.504
ACTUALLY ILLEGAL IN PRIVATE

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:13.441
PLANS SO THIS IMPROVEMENT IS

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:15.509
IMPORTANT AND IT'S WORTHY --

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:17.378
THERE HAS BEEN QUESTION AND AND

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:18.679
SO THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:19.947
ASSOCIATION HAS A SUPPORT IF

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:22.216
AMENDED POSITION THERE HAVE BEEN

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:24.185
VARIOUS ABOUT COST ESTIMATES

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:26.153
ABOUT THE PLAN OVERTIME AND THEY

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:26.720
HAVE.

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:28.522
VARIED WILDLY.

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:29.957
A AT THE PRESENT TIME --

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:31.892
WE BELIEVE --

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:35.429
THE ACTUARIAL COST IS THESE

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:35.996
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:36.730
MILLION PER YEAR --

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:40.334
THE SPONSORS HAVE INDICATED THAT

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.002
NO -- POSED

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:44.171
PEPPERIDGE JUDGE SHOULD HAVE

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:45.706
THEIR RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:48.109
INCREASED BECAUSE OF THE

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:49.944
ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL.

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:51.479
THE OTHER UNIQUE THING ABOUT

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:54.081
JUDGES PENSION LAW UNDER PEPPER.

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:56.917
IS THIS ONE HALF OF NORMAL COST

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:58.919
OBLIGATION ON NEW PEPPERIDGE

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:00.521
JUDGES.

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.456
HAS THE HIGHEST EMPLOYEE

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:04.291
CONTRIBUTION I'M AWARE OF IN THE

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:06.827
STATE SYSTEM IT IS PRESENTLY

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:08.796
SIXTEEN POINT 75% OF SALARY

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:09.096
[inaudible]

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:11.665
WHICH IS FAR HIGHER THAN ANY

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:13.701
OTHER EMPLOYEES THAT I KNOW OF

01:36:13.767 --> 01:36:15.669
SO WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT

01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:17.571
THE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:19.840
JUDGES WHO COULD SEE THAT

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:22.243
SIXTEEN POINT 75% GO UP.

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:22.877
AND WE HAVE ASKED FOR

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:25.079
CLARIFICATION THAT THEIR

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:26.480
CONTRIBUTION WOULD NOT BE

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:29.250
INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE

01:36:29.316 --> 01:36:29.550
[inaudible]

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:30.985
WHICH WOULD [inaudible]

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:33.921
IMPLEMENT THE A STATEMENT MADE

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:36.157
BY THE SPONSORS THAT NO POST

01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:37.625
PEPPER JUDGE WOULD PAY MORE FOR

01:36:37.691 --> 01:36:38.792
THIS BENEFIT.

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:39.994
IF THAT AMENDMENT IS INCLUDED

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.662
WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT THE

01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:43.531
BILL AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

GET GO --

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:43.891
WHEN THIS STARTED LAST YEAR?

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:46.927
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT --

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.562
COLLEAGUES I I WANT TO TALK

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:49.063
ABOUT THE REQUEST FOR AN

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:51.665
AMENDMENT --

01:37:51.732 --> 01:37:52.733
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED JUDGES

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.401
THAT R. J. ARRESTS ONE AND THEN

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:55.769
YOU HAVE?

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:57.338
ROUGHLY THIRTEEN HUNDRED BETTER

01:37:57.404 --> 01:37:58.906
CHERISH TO IN ANOTHER TWO

01:37:58.973 --> 01:38:00.140
HUNDRED BETTER POST PEPPER THAT

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:01.842
ARE NEW --

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:04.778
WHEN THE ACTUARIES I DO THE?

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:07.147
CALCULATION OF THE CONTRIBUTION --

01:38:07.214 --> 01:38:08.482
I CERTAINLY EMPATHIZE WITH THE

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:09.917
FACT THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:11.952
POST PEPPER JUDGES --

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:13.787
WE WORK WITH CALPERS YESTERDAY

01:38:13.854 --> 01:38:16.156
AFTERNOON AFTER THIS ISSUE WAS.

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:18.158
BROUGHT TO US AND THEY'RE A

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:19.560
LITTLE RELUCTANT TO MAKE ANY

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:21.662
RECOMMENDED CHANGES.

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:23.664
IN THAT THE BILL AS IT IS A IT

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:24.665
WOULD BE VERY HARD TO TELL

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:25.566
ACTUARY HOW TO MAKE SOME

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:27.034
CALCULATIONS --

01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:28.068
SO THAT'S WHY I'M [inaudible]

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:30.738
SORT OF NOT GOING THE AMENDMENT

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:32.439
ROUTE I'M KIND OF SAYING THIS IS

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:33.040
LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS A

01:38:33.107 --> 01:38:34.041
YEAR.

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:35.242
IT WAS A LOT BIGGER WHEN WE

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:36.810
STARTED WE HAD A LIABILITY THAT

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:38.178
WAS OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:39.313
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:42.416
ACTUARIES AT CALPERS AN EXTERNAL.

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:44.184
AND SO I I BELIEVE THAT THE

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.520
GOVERNOR I SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:48.722
ACCOMMODATE THIS COST WE'VE JUST

01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:50.357
GIVEN SOME GET FUNDING TO THE TO

01:38:50.424 --> 01:38:51.625
THE JUDICIARY BRANCH IN THIS

01:38:51.692 --> 01:38:53.327
CURRENT BUDGET THAT WAS APPROVED

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:54.061
LAST WEEK.

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:55.129
AND WE'RE ALSO DOING A WHOLE LOT

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:56.430
FOR THE MENTALLY ILL AND THE

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:58.365
HOMELESS I I WOULD THINK THAT --

01:38:58.432 --> 01:39:00.367
WE SHOULD BE REFLECTIVE OF WHO'S

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.336
REALLY WORKING HARD MAKING OUR

01:39:02.403 --> 01:39:04.505
JUDICIAL SYSTEM WORK AND FOR FOR

01:39:04.571 --> 01:39:06.440
THIS SMALL AND A MODIFICATION

01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:07.741
WE'RE GIVING A BIG INCENTIVE. TO
