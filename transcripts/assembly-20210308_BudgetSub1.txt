OF PANEL FIVE. AS WE BEGIN TODAY. I DO WANNA. HAVE SOME OPENING REMARKS. THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR OUR STATE. HOW THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION RESPONDS TO THIS PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY AND WHAT CHANGES WE MAKE TO RISE OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. STRONGER ARE HOW HE WILL BE REMEMBERED. SO WE MUST START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS NOT HIT US ALL EQUALLY. SOME HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SHELTER IN PLACE AND WORK FROM HOME WHILE OTHERS HAVE BEEN LABELED ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE EXPOSED THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE DISPARITIES PARTICULARLY FOR ARE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY THAT WE WILL HEAR ABOUT LATER OUR DEEP AND WIDE. BUT ARE NOT SURPRISING. WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO LACK INSURANCE GET SICKER AND THEY DIE SOONER. THIS PANDEMIC WHICH HAS MAGNIFIED AND EXACERBATE EXACERBATED UNDERLYING HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LATINOS AND OUR UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY. FORCE US NOW TO ASK HOW CAN WE CHANGE SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE FOR THE NEXT CRISIS. WE KNOW THAT THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF OUR STATE'S REMAINING UNINSURED IS OUR UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY COMMUNITY THAT HAS CONTINUED TO DO THE ESSENTIAL WORK NEEDED FOR OUR STATE TO HAVE A BOUNTIFUL HARVEST BUT WHO HAVE NOT HAD THEIR OWN BASIC ESSENTIAL NEEDS. TAKEN CARE OF. CENTRAL TO THAT IS THE BASIC HUMAN RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. FOR US TO DIRECTLY AND SERIOUSLY ADDRESS EQUITY THUS AFFECTING THE DISPARITIES BORN OUT IN THIS PANDEMIC WE MUST WORK TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AS OUR NORTH STAR. WE MUST AT A MINIMUM MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT TO PROTECT OUR ELDERS AND SENIORS FROM THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNIY THIS YEAR WHILE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW TO ACTUALIZE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. BUT THIS BEGS THE QUESTION. WILL THE GOVERNOR MAKE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE A PRIORITY CAN MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO KEEP ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE AND HELP. THIS IS HIS LEGACY. THIS IS HOW HE WILL BE REMEMBERED HI STAND READY TO ROLL UP MY SLEEVES TO PUT FAITH AND WORKS INTO ACTION TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. WITH THAT FRAMING LET'S BEGIN TODAY'S HERE. WE WILL BEGIN WITH A PANEL ONE ON HEALTH FOR ALL. FOR THOSE PANELISTS OR PRESENTERS PLEASE PRESENT IN THE ORDER THEIR NAME APPEARS ON THE AGENDA. WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED. LET'S BEGIN WITH JOSE TORRES FROM HEALTHAXIS. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSE TORRES ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION AND A CO SPONSOR IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDING FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL. ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO ROUTINE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE. THEY ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDIC HOW WHICH COVERS EMERGENCY ROOM CARE. THE EMERGENCY ROOM IS THE LEAST EFFICIENT MOST EXPENSIVE WAY TO PROVIDE CARE AND NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS COVERED UNDER FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL. AS A RESULT UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS REMAIN UNINSURED LIVE CENTER THANK YOUNG- AND R. ONE MEDICAL EMERGENCY AWAY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN. WE NEED COVERAGE AND CARE NOW ESPECIALLY PANDEMIC THAT EXACERBATES EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND HAS TARGETED THE SAME COMMUNITIES OF ESSENTIAL AND EXPOSE WORKERS. BY EXPANDING MEDIC HOUSE WITH ALL INDOCUMENTADOS WE CAN CLOSE ONE OF THE LARGEST REMAINING COVERAGE GAPS AND STRENGTHEN THE HEALTH SYSTEM THAT WE ALL RELY ON. WE WOULD TAKE A LARGE STEP TO ENSURE EVERYONE DAHLE IN OUR STATE HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK YOU TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND ANY HEALTH. THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ORVILLE THOMAS. CIBC GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT OUR HEALTH FOR ALL CAMPAIGN AND THE PRESSING NEED TO PUSH FOR A MEDIC CAL EXPANSION TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS MY NAME IS WARFEL THOMAS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER I ALSO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE'S COMMUNITY BAXEEN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. OVER THE LAST YEAR DURING COPE IT. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS HAVE MADE UP A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF WORKERS DEEMED AS ESSENTIAL. THEY HAVE CONTINUE TO PUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AT RISK TO SERVE THE STATE AND TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY MOVING. THIS WORK OFTEN HAPPENED AND CONTINUES TO HAPPEN DESPITE LIMITED ACCESS TO BASIC WORKER PROTECTIONS. PP AND WITH IMMIGRANT WORKERS TYPICALLY LIVING IN COMMUNITIES THAT LACK BASIC HEALTH ESSENTIALS. THIS IS ALSO HAS HAPPENED TO A POPULATION THAT HAS HISTORICALLY NOT HAD ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE LEAVING THE MOST VULNERABLE TO THE CORONA VIRUS SINCE THEY HAD. MORE UNDERLYING CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND COMORBIDITIES THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PREVENTIVE CARE. AND NOW IS WE ARE STARTING TO THINK THROUGH THE VACCINATION FUEL RECOVERY IS IMPORTANT NOTE THAT IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE STILL FALLING BEHIND. AS THEY ARE UNDER REPRESENTED. IN VACCINATION RATES COMPARED TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. AND ON INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY IT WOULD BE NEGLIGENT. TO NOT MENTION THAT IMMIGRANT WMEN HAVE BEEN MOST AFFECTED OR MORE AFFECTED THAN THEIR WHITE CONTEMPORARIES DURING COATED WITH JOBS IN RESTAURANTS HOSPITALITY HEALTHCARE BEING CUT. WITHOUT A PROMISE OF FIRST RETURN OR POSSIBILITY TO TURN TO THOSE JOBS AT ALL. I UNDERSTAND THE PUSH FROM COMMUNITIES IN ELECTED OFFICIALS TO GET BACK TO A SENSE OF NORMAL AND TO BE IN OUR LONG NEEDED RECOVERY. BUT WE MUST NOT USE BACK TO NORMAL AS A STANDARD WE MUST GET BACK TO SOMETHING BETTER. THE LAST SEVEN YEARS CALIFORNIA POLICY CENTER AND OUR PARTNERS AT HEALTH ACCESS. HAVE SUCCESSFULLY WORKED WITH LEGISLATORS AND TWO GOVERNORS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARECOVERAGE TO PREVIOUSLY UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE HELD FOR ALL KIDS AND HEALTH FOR ALL YOUNG ADULTS CAMPAIGN. THERE ARE NOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. THAT CAN RECEIVE MEDICAL COVERAGE IF THEIR INCOME ELIGIBLE. AS SUCCESSFUL AS THOSE CAMPAIGNS WERE THEY DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT OR IMMEDIATELY. IT TOOK A PUSH FROM OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND A VULNERABILITY TO SHARE THEIR STORIES OF DEATH AND LOSS. NOW IS THE TIME TO FINISH THE CAMPAIGNS THAT WE STARTED AND GROW FROM SOME TO ALL. THIS ISSUE IS ALSO TIMELY AS THERE IS A FEDERAL PARTNER IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS. THAT POLITICAL ALIGNMENT MAY ALLOW FOR THE STATE TO START THE INVESTMENT IN HEALTH CARE EXPANSION AND WORK ON FUTURE COST SAVINGS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS CAUSE AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR STATES UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION. THIS HEARING AND THE TESTIMONY FROM WITNESSES WILL HOPEFULLY HELP BRING THIS HEALTHCARE TO EVERY CALIFORNIANS. BY ELIMINATING THE BARRIERS BASED ON WHERE SOMEONE WAS BORN. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN YOUR EFFORT TO ENSURE HEALTH FOR ALL. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM LAUREL LUCILA. GOOD AFTERNOON AND I HAVE SOME SLIDES TO SHARE I SEE I CAN SHOW THEM NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAUREL THIS YEAR I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM AT THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY ON THE REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC. I WANTED TO START BY BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGING HOW INTEGRAL AND DOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE TO OUR STATE. THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION UNDOCUMENTED- CALIFORNIANS MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR WORK FORCE. THEY PAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXES EACH YEAR. AND MOST ARE LONG TERM RESIDENTS WITH STRONG ROOTS IN THE STATE AND THEY'RE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AS WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT UC BERKELEY AND UCLA WE PROJECTED HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS WOULD BE UNINSURED AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO AFTER A D. IMPORTANT STATE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO REMOVE THE STATE CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WE ESTIMATED THAT THREE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS I WOULD BE UNANSWERED AFTER AS YOUNG ADULTS EXPANSION THE STATE AFFORDABILITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA AND AFTER THIS STATE. MANDATE WAS IMPLEMENTED. BUT UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS AT MAKE UP THE LARGEST GROUP OF UNINSURED AS- AROUND ONE POINT THREE MILLION UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE UNINSURED. AND THEY MAKE UP THE LARGEST GROUP BECAUSE THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM ACA AND MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY UNDER FEDERAL POLICY AND UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE OFFERED A JOB BASED COVERAGE BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. LAUREL ARE YOU PUBLIC LORALAI I APOLOGIZE- WE HAVE A PRESENTER WHO NEEDS TO PRESENT AND I WENT OUT OF ORDER SO- IT'S- NOT TRADITIONAL BUT I MAY ASK YOU TO PAUSE YOUR PRESENTATION YES OKAY I WILL US STOP SHARING THE SLIDES AND WE WILL HAVE WILLIAM SERRANO ALAMO PRESENT AT THE MOMENT AND WE WILL COME BACK. RIGHT TO YOU LAUREL THANK YOU. FOR YOUR INDULGENCE LILIANE IF YOU CAN BEGIN. THANK YOU. AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LILLIAN SERRANO AND TODAY I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE STORY OF AN ORTHODONTIST. MY MOTHER IN LAW WHO WAS UNDOCUMENTED AND UNINSURED LIKE MANY OTHERS IN OUR STATE. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN MY FAMILY AND I SUFFERED THE LOSS OF MY MOTHER IN LAW AFTER MONTHS OF TRYING EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TO US TO GET HER MEDICAL CARE. THE NATIONAL LEVEL ARRIVE IN ESCONDIDO CALIFORNIA OVER TWENTY YEARS SEVERAL. SHE BUILT A LIFE HERE WITH HER EIGHT KIDS- MY HUSBAND WHO WAS THE FIRST IN HIS FAMILY TO GRADUATE WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND WEBER TOOK CARE OF HER KIDS GRANDCHILDREN AND EVEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS SHE WAS A COMMUNITY LEADER WHO ALWAYS STRIVE TO DEMONSTRATION. AND LOCAL HEARINGS. IT WAS NORMAL FOR THEM TO HANDLE THEM OUT TO GO MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS WITHOUT DOCTORS VISITS. MONTHS BEFORE HER DEATH SHE STARTED COMPLAINING OF STRONG ABDOMINAL PAIN SO WE TOOK HER TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CLINIC. NONE OF US COULD HAVE IMAGINED THE POSSIBILITY THAT WOULD SEEM LIKE A STOMACH PROBLEM WAS CALLED BLADDER CANCER. IT WAS A LONG PROCESS JUST TO GET HER CLOSE TO A DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE COMMUNITY CLINICS ARE NOT THE SIGN FOR THIS CASES. WE NEED A SPECIALIST AND TESTING THE CLINIC CAN OFFER. WE TRIED EVERY PLACE BUT MOST DON'T TAKE PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE THE PRICES WERE TOO HIGH IN THE WAITING TIME WAS TOO LONG. AND WEBER KEPT COMING IN AND OUT OF THE LOCAL EMERGENCY ROOM. IT WAS ONLY AFTER SHE WENT TO THE ER AT UCSD MEDICAL CENTER SHE WAS ABLE TO GET A PROPER ASSESSMENT. AT THAT POINT THE DOCTOR WAS ABLE TO CONFRONT THE HARD TRUTH. THAT SHE HAD FINAL STAGE GALLBLADDER CANCER. THE DOCTORS THINK THAT THE CANCER HAD ALREADY BEEN SPREADING FOR OVER FIVE YEARS. THEY EXPLAINED TO US THAT THE EARLY SYMPTOMS COULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSED WITH DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS. THE NATIONAL WEBER HAD NEVER VISITED A DOCTOR FOR HER PAIN BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF THE PROJECT. ONCE SHE HAD FINAL STAGE CNCER THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO. NOVEMBER PASSED AWAY SURROUNDED BY ALL HER KIDS AND GRAND KIDS ON HER HOSPITAL BED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF FINALLY RECEIVING A MEDICAL TREATMENT. THOSE WERE THE LONGEST AND MOST PAINFUL WEEKS OF OUR LIVES. THE WOMAN WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF ALL OF US EVEN ME GOOD I'M SURE HER BLOOD WAS ON THE BED IN PAIN AND THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO. WE ALL KEPT ASKING OURSELVES WHAT SHE COULD HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY COUNT ON REGULAR DOCTORS VISITS. OR EVEN WHEN SHE FELT THE STOMACH PAIN. WHAT IS SHE WAS NOT UNDOCUMENTED DOES SHE HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. GETTING A PROPER MEDICAL CARE EARLY COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE LOSS OF THE NATIONAL GUERRA A COMMUNITY LEADER WHO WAS THE HEART OF OUR FAMILY. WE WOULDN'T NEED TO SEE HER SUFFER WITHOUT A WAY OF PREVENTING OR STOPPING HER PAIN. WE WOULDN'T BE LEFT WITH UNPAID MEDICAL BILLS. MY FAMILY AND I ADVOCATE FOR HELPFUL FOR ALL BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVER EXPERIENCE WHAT WE WENT THROUGH. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER OR DIE FROM A TREATABLE CONDITION NO MATTER WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILLIAM FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE WILL NOW MOVE TO LAURA LUCIR. SERVING THE UNINSURED ESTIMATES THAT A WAS DISCUSSING I WERE PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN AND OF COURSE A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN. IT CALIFORNIA WE SENIOR AND MANY CALIFORNIANS LOSE JOB BASED COVERAGE DUE TO LOSING THEIR JOB DURING CONVENTION AS AND AT THE SAME TIME MEDICAL ENROLLMENT AND COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLMENT HAVE GROUND. WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT THE NET IMPACT OF THESE COVERAGE SHIFTS HAS BEEN ON THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN THE STATE- BUT WHAT'S MOST RELEVANT TO THIS CONVERSATION TODAY IS AS HOW HAS THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED AND UNINSURED ADULTS CHANGED- FIRST IT WE'VE HAD A POSITIVE CHANGE THAT BETWEEN JANUARY AND OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. EIGHTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AGES NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE GAMES FULL SCOPE MEDICAL BENEFITS UNDER THE YOUNG ADULT EXPANSION. AND THAT EXPANSION IS ALREADY REFLECTED AND ARE UNINSURED ESTIMATES. ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S LIKELY THAT THERE WERE AND DOCUMENTED WORKERS. WHO LOST JOBS COVERAGE DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN THEY LOST THEIR JOB WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY- BUT EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC FUEL AND DOCUMENTED WORKERS HAD JOB BASED COVERAGE TO BEGIN WITH. AS ON AS A WHOLE AND IT SEEMS VERY LIKELY TO ME THAT UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS HAVE CONTINUED TO MAKE UP THE LARGEST GROUP OF UNINSURED. EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WERE EXPERIENCING WORSE ACCESS TO CARE THIS IS DATA FROM COLLEAGUES AT UCLA THAT SHOWS THAT 44% OF UNDOCUMENTED LOW INCOME ADULTS. HEY DID NOT HAVE A U. S. USUAL SOURCE OF CARE. COMPARED 224% OF CITIZENS AND DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WITH THE SAME INCOME LEVEL. AND UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BY COVERED BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND HEALTH WISE. WE DON'T HAVE DATA ON KOBE CASES AND DEATHS SPECIFICALLY BY IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT WE KNOW THAT NONCITIZEN IMMIGRANTS. LIKE ME AT TO HAVE CERTAIN RISK FACTORS FOR COBIZ INCLUDING RISK FACTORS RELATED TO WORK. A STUDY BY UCSF RESEARCHERS COMPARED THE ACTUAL TAX RATES FOR CALIFORNIA WORKING ADULTS AGE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER DURING THE PANDEMIC TO THE EXPECTED DEATH RATES BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THEY FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE THE RISK OF DEATH. BUT FOR ALL CALIFORNIA ADULTS WITH 22% HIGHER DURING THE PANDEMIC- BUT IT WAS EVEN WORSE FOR THOSE WHO WORK IN OCCUPATIONS THAT ARE COMMON AMONG NON CITIZENS. WHAT THIS TABLE SHOWS IS THE FIVE TOP OCCUPATIONS. FOR NON CITIZEN WORKERS NATIONALLY. I FOR CUTS. AS THE MORTALITY RATE WAS 16% HIGHER DURING THE PANDEMIC COMPARED TO PRE PANDEMIC AND THAT WAS THAT THE OCCUPATION WITH THE VERY HIGHEST INCREASE AND THE DEATH RATES. I RECALL CHIRLA WORKERS- HAD A 55% INCREASE THE MORTALITY RATE DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR CONSTRUCTION LABORS IT WAS FORTY NINE PRESENTS AND FOR MAIDS AND HOUSEKEEPERS 33% LATINOS HAVE ALSO BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC THIS IS DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT REFLECTS ALL LATINOS THE VAST MAJORITY OF HIM ARE CITIZENS. HOWEVER APPROXIMATELY 86% OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE LATINO SO THIS DATA. TELLS US SOMETHING BROADLY ABOUT HOW UNDOCUMENTED. LATINO ADULTS- HAVE FARED DURING THE PANDEMIC. WELL THAT HE KNOWS OF ALL AGES HAVE HAD HIGHER RATES OF TESTING POSITIVE FOR KOBE AND OF DYING FROM COPE IT AND THE DISPARITY IS ESPECIALLY SEVERE UP FOR OLDER LATINO ADULTS FOR THOSE AGES SIXTY FIVE TO SEVENTY NINE- THE CHINOS MADE UP ALMOST HALF OF THE KOBE DEATHS. BUT ONLY AT 822% OF THE POPULATION OF THAT AIDS. HE'S A DISPARITIES IN CODE RELATED OUTCOMES ARE THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF LONG STANDING HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR IMMIGRANTS FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY. I LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE IS LIKELY ONE OF MANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THESE DISPARITIES. THERE'S AT LEAST ONE STUDIES THAT SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OUR- IT AS AN INSURANCE RATES AND HIGHER CO THAT CASES AND DEATH RATES AND THAT'S- NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THE PAST RESEARCH. THAT HAS FOUND THAT HAVING INSURANCE IMPROVE PEOPLE'S USE OF PREVENTIVE CARE AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE THEY GET MORE REGULAR CARE FOR THEIR CHRONIC CONDITIONS HAVING INSURANCE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER MORTALITY RATES. ELEMENT INSURANCE IMPROVES FINANCIAL SECURITY AND CREWS WORK FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE ALSO STRONGER WHEN EVERYONE IS INCLUDED. EXPANDING MEDICAL REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS A VERY WELL TARGETED POLICY. TO ACHIEVING OUR STATE'S GOAL OF MOVING CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND THAT'S BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE HEALTH. BASED ON THEIR INCOME BUT FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS LACK INSURANCE AND VERY MUCH NEED THIS POLICY. I ESTIMATE THAT ONE POINT OH FOUR MILLION UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIA ADULTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE L. UNDER AN EXPANSION. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE ARE ALREADY ENROLLED AND RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDICS ALL. WHICH COVERS EMERGENCY AND PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES USING FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST IT MEANS THAT MOST OF THOSE ELIGIBLE CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY POSITIONS HAVE FULL BENEFITS WHEN THE POLICY IS IMPLEMENTED AS WAS DONE- WITH THE EXPANSION OF CHEN DOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. AND SECONDLY THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LARGE PART OF THE COST IS ALREADY BEING COVERED. GIVEN THAT EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES ARE AMONG. THE MORE EXPENSIVE TYPES OF CARE. UNDER AN EXPANSION ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIA ADULTS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ENROLL IN THE SYSCO GUEST ON THOSE AGES IT HAS TWENTY SIX IN A- AND THIS REFLECTS. MOSTLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE BENEFITS CLASS I ASSUME THAT HALF OF THOSE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ENROLLED WITH NEARLY A ROLL. AND AMONG AMONG THESE AND ROWLEY'S TWENTY NINE THOUSAND ARE. AGES SIXTY FIVE PLUS. SO TO SUMMARIZE MY THREE BECAUSE A POINTS YESTERDAY WHERE THAT UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST GROUP OF UNINSURED IN THE STATE. AND THAT A UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT BY THE PANDEMIC- AS IS SUGGESTED BY THE DATA ON THE OCCUPATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATES DURING THE CANS AT MAC. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IF ELIGIBILITY WERE EXPANDED NEARLY NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS COULD GAIN FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE AND THAT WOULD REDUCE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNINSURED BY THE STATE IN THE STATE BY APPROXIMATELY ONE REPORTER. THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KATY REBEL FROM COVERED CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND KATIE RAVEL POLICY DIRECTOR COVERED CALIFORNIA HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO TALK ABOUT A COVER CALIFORNIA AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR ENROLLMENT TRENDS AND RECENT FEDERAL ACTIONS AND POLICY CHANGES THAT MAY IMPACT OUR PROGRAM. AS YOU KNOW THE AFFORDABLE CHARACTER MAGICALLY CHANGE THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET WHICH IS WELL SUB- SUMMARIZED IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S AGENDA FOR TODAY. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS THE CREATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE'S THROUGH WHICH ELIGIBLE AMERICANS CAN PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND ACCESS. FEDERAL SUBSIDIES TO REDUCE THEIR MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS. COVER CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE IS THE LARGEST STATE RUN EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITH OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN ROYALTIES. TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA ENACTED FOR FIRST STATE BASED PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES OVER 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES TODAY. THE PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES INCREASED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE SECOND YEAR THAT THREE YEAR PROGRAM. AND NOW MOVES TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON OUR INVOLVEMENT AND THEN I'LL RETURN TO THE STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM IN A FEW MOMENTS TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE AND AT THAT PENDING FEDERAL STIMULUS LEGISLATION. AS OF JANUARY NEARLY ONE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAD EITHER RENEWED OR SIGNED UP FOR NEW COVERAGE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IN THIS REPRESENTED A HIGH WATER MARK FOR OUR INVOLVEMENT OVER THE LIFE OF OUR PROGRAM- THE NUMBER ALSO REPRESENTS A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. POINT- INCREASING PLANTS. OF THE SAME TIME PERIOD LAST YEAR. OF OUR MEMBERSHIP 90% RECEIVE FINANCIAL HELP INCLUDING SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND WHO RECEIVED STATE SUBSIDIES. AND OF THOSE STATE SUBSIDY RECIPIENTS NEARLY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ARE MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND 6100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHO WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES I AM REALLY I HAVE BENEFITTED FROM OUR STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. SO LET ME NOW ADDRESS WHAT COVER CALIFORNIA DID ADMIT COVERAGE MORE ACCESSIBLE DURING THE PANDEMIC. OF FIRST WE ACTED QUICKLY IN TWENTY TWENTY. TO ENSURE THAT ALL IMPACTED AN ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS WERE ABLE TO SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE. WE DID THIS BY IMPLEMENTING A SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD THAT SPANNED FROM MARCH TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. TO AUGUST THIRTY FIRST. WE ALSO DURING THAT TIME INVESTED NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNEW OF THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD. AND DURING THAT TIME TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS SIGNED UP FOR COVERAGE. WHICH WAS MORE THAN TWICE THE NUMBER. WHO SIGNED UP DURING THAT SAME PERIOD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THEN ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH. OF THIS YEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD OF THE STATE THAT ARE SERVED BY THE FEDERAL MARKETPLACE. COVERED CALIFORNIA IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE AND IT DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FOLLOW THIS BY ANNOUNCING A SPECIALENROLLMENT PERIOD UP FOR CONSUMERS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. AND OUR SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD RUNS FROM FEBRUARY FIRST THROUGH THE FIFTEEN. DURING THIS TIME MORE INVESTING SIX MILLION TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THE SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD INCLUDING WITH A DIGITAL AND TELEVISION ADS. THAT STARTING IN FEBRUARY. MELTER DISK SOME OF DISCUSS AND PROPOSALS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL RELATED HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE'S AND HOW THEY MIGHT IMPACT CALIFORNIA. I THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN THE FEDERAL STIMULUS PROPOSAL UNDER CONSIDERATION IN CONGRESS INCLUDES SEVERAL PROVISIONS THAT WOULD IMPACT EXCHANGES. OF FIRST IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE PREMIUM SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS HELLO 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL OF FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO COVERAGE YEARS. IT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE CURRENT FEDERAL CAP ON SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS OVER LEVEL AND ENSURE THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN EIGHT POINT 5% OF THEIR INCOME. IN PREMIUMS FOR THE BENCHMARK PLAN. THIS PROVISION WOULD ALSO APPLY FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. FINALLY THERE'S A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD MAKE RECIPIENTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. OFFERED THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. SHOULD THESE PROPOSALS THE ENACTED A COVER CALIFORNIA WILL WORK WITH THE AND- YOU KNOW ALLEGES TO IMPLEMENT ANY NEEDED. WHAT WE CAN SAY IS THAT THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY STRUCTURE THAT'S PROPOSED WOULD BE MORE GENEROUS THAN THE STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE TODAY FOR INSTANCE IN STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM L. CONSUMERS PAY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND 18% OF THEIR INCOME FOR PREMIUMS IF THEY'RE IN OUR WOULD BE THE FEDERAL PROPOSAL BE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS. OF FOR ALL ENROLLEES. IN OUR PROGRAM. AND FINALLY A TO YOUR QUITE. OF THE FEDERAL. WOULD PROVIDE FORGET FOR. WHO HAVE TO WRITE. AND RE. FEDERAL SUBSIDIES PREMIUM SUBSIDY THAT RICK THEY RECEIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY- ALL CONSUMER AFTER. THEIR SUB. SOME AT OUR GET A REFUND DURING FILING PROCESS SOME OF CASES PROPOSED. I WOULD FORGET THE READ. THE COVER CALIFORNIA PREMIUMS AND PRO ALL REQUIRE RECKON. THROUGH THE FRANCHISE BOARD ALSO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAL COULD CONSIDER. HEARING FEDERAL POLICY. A DOZEN END OF MY REMARKS I LOOK FOR TO SPEAKING YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY. NEXT HAVE DIRECTOR LIBEL. DR ON THE LOWER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON BOTH FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- TO START ALL. WELL SORT OF THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA'S WORLD MEDICAL MORE THAN HALF OF THE CHILDREN. GO FOR THE COVERT UPDATE BEGAN WE WERE ACTUALLY SINGLE DECLINE IN THE MEDICAL CASE LONG MOMENTS TWENTY SIXTEEN- HIGH POINT- THE COMPANY WAS DOING STRONG ALL.

ALL IN THE CURRENT WE OF COURSE WELL ON. ASCENTIAL THIRTEEN ONLY AND CONTINUING TO RUN- THE- THANK YOU ALMOST FOURTEEN WILL EXCUSE ME ALL. IMPAR OF THIS THE FIVE ABOUT WAS PART OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH MORE- WE SUSPEND ALL READ IT NAY OF MEN CAL ELIGIBILITY AND SO THAT MEANS THAT. BY TIME THE ALL WORKING SEE ANIMALS WHICH IS EXPRESS TO BE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL PASS TO SUBMIT TO CUBA. ALL OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR PEOPLE A MONTH WHO WERE.

NUMBER ONE ELEMENT IS ONE WHAT ON LATE TO THE COME. YOU MAY FIND THAT THERE IS A PORTION OF CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE WELL IT ROLLED OFF THE MACHINE. BECAUSE OF. I'M GOING TO GO CLIMATE SURROUNDING. I MEAN. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE WORLD. ASK YOUR- I HAVE BEEN A SHIFTS AND SQUADRONS BETWEEN- OF SPANISH SPEAKING SEVERAL OF THE- LEAD TO THANK THAT THERE MAY BE POSSIBLE DOWNLOAD CRUSHER ON ENROLLMENTS JUST OUT OF CONCERN- WHERE FEDERAL POLICIES DON'T SO THAT MAY- CLAY SOME- WON'T HAVE SOME OF THAT TOMORROW YEAH. THE NEW YORK- TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE MEDICAL CREW. PART OF THE THAT MAKE I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO WELL J. C. COOPER. OUR CHIEF DEPUTY JULY AND STAY MEDICAID WHAT. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. I'M SO I WILL SPEAK TO- THE ACA AS OUR DURING THE PUBLIC HELP THEM- I WILL COVER A AREA OF WHERE EXPANDED. DURING THE HEALTH AND THEN I WILL QUICKLY TOUCH ON SOME ADDITIONAL ITEMS FOR CASELOAD- SO DO YOU SEE AS ACTED IMMEDIATELY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REQUEST- OVER SIXTY OR SEVENTY VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES ACROSS VERY- MULTIPLE. FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES- IT INCLUDED THINGS LIKE PROVIDER PARTICIPATION BILLING- AND CONDITIONS FOR PAYMENT OF FLEXIBILITIES AROUND STATE THEIR HEARINGS ARE BENEFIT FLEXIBILITIES INCLUDING AS A TELEHEALTH EXPANSION WHICH WE PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED TO THIS GROUP- AS WELL AS ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS- FOR THINGS LIKE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TESTING. OXYGEN ARE VERY CRITICAL ITEMS THAT WERE NECESSARY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITIES ARE TO MEET THE NEEDS- OVER THE GROWING MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A WEEKLY STAKEHOLDER ANNOUNCEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT ALL THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY PLANS AND OTHERS A CONTRACT ALL THE VARIOUS CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EXPENSIVE. AND RELAUNCH THE VARIOUS WEB PAGES SO THERE WAS AN EASY WAY FOR PEOPLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OR TO STAY CURRENT WITH THOSE FLEXIBILITIES. THEY ALSO ISSUED A BENEFICIARY NOTICE TO ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SO THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR RIGHTS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AS WELL AS SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT WERE BEING ROLLED OUT TO THE INSURED THEY KNEW HOW TO ACCESS CARE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. SHE STAYS HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE GIVEN OUR MANY OF THE OUR PROVIDER OFFICES IN THE VERY EARLY PART OF THE PANDEMIC HAD ACTUALLY CLOSED OR RESTRICTED ACCESS. WHICH WE SAW THE LARGE INCREASE OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES DURING THAT. TIME WE ALSO LAUNCHED A MET A CAL NURSE LINE WHICH PROVIDED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ACCESS TO ALL UNDER THE- ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. ALSO IN UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS ARE THROUGH THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NURSE LINE WE ALSO INCLUDED CONNECTING UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE COVERAGE AS WELL AS IF THEY WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE- ARE UNINSURED COVERAGE GROUP. I NOW KIND OF WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE VARIOUS ELIGIBILITY FLEXIBILITIES SPECIFICALLY THAT WE ROLLED OUT DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AS BILL MENTIONED. WE DO HAVE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES SO. ANY INDIVIDUAL ON THAT CAL WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS- ESSENTIALLY OUR STATE HAS STAYED ON DURING THE ENTIRE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND WILL STATE ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL AND HAVE COVERAGE UNTIL THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WHICH IS CURRENTLY PROJECTED TO BE THROUGH THE END OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ALSO WAGE PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING FOR CHIP BENEFICIARIES WE ADDED THE OPTIONAL UNINSURED COVERAGE NINETY- CODE NINETEEN ELIGIBILITY GROUP. WHICH INCLUDED TESTING AND- TESTING RELATED SERVICES AND TREATMENT OF FOR THOSE BENEFICIARIES TO RECEIVE SERVICES DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WE EXPANDED HOSPITAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE OVER SIXTY FIVE AGE AND DISABLED POPULATION AS WELL AS ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HOSPITAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY TO BE COVERED MORE THAN ONE- H. P. PERIOD IN A GIVEN TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. ALSO THEY COULD NOW HAVE TWO PERIODS WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY IT WAS JUST ONE. WE ISSUED GUIDANCE TO OUR COUNTIES FOR HOW TO ENROLL WITHOUT AN APPLICANT SIGNATURE AS WELL WAS ROLLED OUT TELEPHONIC ENROLLMENT IN OUR AFFECT PROGRAM PROGRAM. AND EVERY WOMAN COUNTS. KHAGANATE AS INDEED. I'M HAS TO STICK IN ON MEDICARE AND THE DEPARTMENTS BUDGET- AS I WILL EXPLAIN DURING HIS INTRODUCTION ON THE MEDICARE CASELOAD HAS BEEN DECLINING SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE'RE WE DID HAVE A PEEK AROUND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION SIMILAR TO THE NUMBER OF LIVES. CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN OUR PROGRAM TODAY- IN UP UNTIL THAT POINT WE WERE SEEN THAT DECLINE AND TELL THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY A HIT. WITH THE CAN I WITH THE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE OF REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF COURSE OF THE- PANDEMIC. WE HAVE SEEN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF CASELOAD- ON THE MEDICAL SIDE. MEDI CAL I'M HAS REACHED AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LEVELS OF ACROSS ALL EIGHT CODES. IN OUR LARGEST GROWTH SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LEVELS IS IN THE ACA OPTIONAL EXPANSION WHERE IS PRIOR TO THAT IT HAD BEEN PRETTY STEADY AND WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE. OF BASED ON PREVIOUS LETTERS THAT WE LEVELS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. I'M THE CURRENT CASE LOAD UP. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS FOURTEEN MILLION BNEFICIARIES. OUT WHICH DOES INCLUDE A FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE OR A ONE POINT SEVEN. MILLION DOLLARS BILLION DOLLARS SORRY A GENERAL FUND INCREASE IN IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE CASE LOAD IS PROJECTED AT FIFTEEN POINT SIX MILLION BENEFICIARIES. OF WHICH IS A THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE AND A THIRTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND INCREASE. OUR COSTS RELATED TO THE CASE LOAD IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WERE- BUILT OFF OF TRENDS FROM ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS- OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC OF BUT THINGS HAVE. EVOLVED SINCE THAT TIME AND WE HAVE A LOT MORE DATA SO THE DEPARTMENT- DOES CONTINUE TO LOOK AT MORE RECENT DATA AND ACTUALS AND WE'LL BE UPDATING OUR CODE NINETEEN CASELOAD PROJECTIONS- AFTER MAY REVISE TIME PERIOD. I'M SO THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM NED RESNICK COUGH WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF OUR FINDINGS FROM OUR OFFICES ANALYSIS OF THE MEDIC HOW BUDGET FOR THE COMING YEAR- THE KEY PART OF OUR ANALYSIS WAS FOCUSED ON CASELOAD. BECAUSE CASELOAD GROWTH ACCOUNTS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF YOUR OVER YOUR FUNDING EIGHT- IT IF YOUR OF YOUR FUNDING INCREASE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUT OF- FIVE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ABOUT TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AS RELATED TO UNDERLYING CASE OF GROWTH. THE KEY TAKE AWAY OF OUR ANALYSIS IS WE THINK K. SO GROWTH WILL BE LOWER THAN THE- INSPIRATION PROJECTS AND IN FACT WE'RE EXPECTING CATHOLIC RELATED COSTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN IS PROJECTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. BUT HAVING SAID THAT WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING MAKING ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW I'D SAID WE RECOMMEND WAITING FOR ME WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE DATA ABOUT KISSING GROWTH OVER THAT THE COMING MONTHS TO. MAKE A MAKE AN ASSESSMENT. OF WHAT SHOULD BE GOING FORWARD. THE REASON WHY WE THAT AT- KIDS ARE GROWTH WILL BE LOWER AND THEREFORE COST LESS A PRIMARILY AS- WE THINK THAT IN ORDER FOR K. SO GROWTH LEVELS- IN ORDER FOR A- A CASELOAD GROWTH TO REACH THE LEVELS PROJECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. MONTHLY CREASE CASELOAD GROWTH WE NEED TO INCREASE BY NEARLY FIFTY PERCENT- MORE THAN IT HAS ON AVERAGE DURING THE PANDEMIC THUS FAR FROM MARCH TO DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY- SO- FROM LESS THAN A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND NEW ENROLLEES PER MONTH WHICH IS DIDN'T EAT THE AVERAGE AS FAR WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE UNTIL NEARLY TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. WE FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE- WITHIN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY BUT IT'S LIKELY A WORST CASE SCENARIO. I ALSO WE THINK THAT- LESS OF THE GROWTH WILL COME FROM- SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THAT IS PROJECTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION- BUT MORE LIKELY. MORE OF THE GROWTH WILL COME FROM FAMILIES AND CHILD THIS ADULTS FROM THE ACA OPTIONAL EXPANSION AND THOSE POPULATIONS ARE TYPICALLY LESS COSTLY TO COVER SO SAID THAT ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR SOME OF THE SAVINGS WE ANTICIPATE- BUT BUT AGAIN. THESE PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND SO WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING ANY ADJUSTMENTS AT THIS TIME UNTIL MORE DATA IS AVAILABLE TO REVIEW I THANK YOU AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE PANEL I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS. HAVE QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE I WILL BEGIN MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS BOTH JOSE TORE AS AN ORACLE THOMAS. I WANTED YOU TO HELP FRAME IT FOR US- YOUR EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THE UNINSURED POPULATION. HOW ARE THESE POPULATIONS AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND HOW ARE ALL OF US AFFECTED BY MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LACKING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. HI THIS IS A HORRIBLE THOMAS FROM THE CALIFORNIA POLICY CENTER I'LL GO FIRST. AND YOU KNOW TO HOW THE POPULATION IS AFFECTED BY A LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH ARE I THINK WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR WHAT HAPPENS WITH COBIT AND FOR THOSE POPULATIONS THAT DO NOT UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW THEIR PRIOR CONDITIONS OR THEIR HEALTH- BEING ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMORBIDITIES AND SO IF THEY HAD ACCESS OVER THE YEARS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS AND TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMIC WHETHER THAT IS. TAKING TIME AWAY FROM LIFE THREATENING WORK OR TRYING TO ENFORCE AND TO GET MORE PRECAUTIONS- FOR CONDITIONS THAT THEY KNOW PUT THEM AT GREATER RISK WHEN IT COMES TO THE GREATER POPULATION I THINK. WE COULD SAY THAT THE COST OF CARE. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS DOES GO UP WHEN WE SEE THAT A LACK OF ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE. AND CLINIC VISITS. WOULD RESULT IN GREATER- YOU KNOW TRIPS TO EMERGENCY ROOM FOR CARE THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IT HAS TO DEAL WITH LARGER CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT ARE MORE ADVANCED STAGES- WHETHER THESE ARE THINGS LIKE- LIKE THREATENING ILLNESSES SUCH AS CANCER TO DEEPER STAGE. OR THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED- WHETHER IT IS- ADVERSE HEALTH REACTIONS THAT HAPPEN WITH WORKFORCE OR WORKING CONDITIONS. THOSE ARE A COUPLE THAT I COULD THINK UP THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'LL- PASS IT ALONG TO MY PARTNER JOSE FOR SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS. YES OF COURSE THANK YOU R. O. N. TO ADD ON TO WHAT I HAVE A PARTNER OR JUST MENTION. THERE THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION DOES NOT HAVE ANY ACCESS TO PREVENT OR PRIMARY CARE SO WHEN DAISY HOW. ISSUE CRIME CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES- DIABETES HEART DISEASE OR CANCER THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET IT TAKEN CARE OF AS IT AS IT SHOULD BE- FOR VARIOUS DISEASES THEY MIGHT USE THE EMERGENCY CARE BUT THEY CAN'T SEE. LONG TERM CARE AND- AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM SAME WITH IF THEY WORK IF THEY CONTRACT HOPE IT. UNDER THE UNDER THE CAR UNDER THE CURRENT STATUS THEY'RE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING THAT ANY MEDICAL CARE RELATED TO KOBE IT BY THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO ADDRESS ANY OTHER UNDERLYING CONDITIONS SO. AN OVERALL. IT'S JUST THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS LACK OF ACCESS AND IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IN THE LONG TERM. WHERE WE- AN OFFICIAL LONG TERM WEAR DRESSING THESE CHRONIC CONDITIONS NOW WHAT STATE WOULD GO ON AND SAVE A STATE HEALTH CARE. COSTS IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. WITHOUT FRAMING I'D LIKE TO NOW TURN MY QUESTIONS TO THE LAUREL LUCIA AND I'M LOOKING AT PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR PRESENTATION HERE TODAY. AND REALLY LOOKING OUT THE PERCENT OF LATINOS COVERED CASES AND DEATHS COMPARED WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION. AND WHAT'S STRIKING TO ME ARE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST IS THAT THE LATINO POPULATION WHILE THIRTY EIGHT POINT 9% OF THE OVERALL CALIFORNIA. WE ONLY REPRESENT FIVE TO SEVENTY NINE. IS THAT BECAUSE OF OUR UNDERLYING HEALTH DISPARITIES IS THAT BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF. PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE ACCESS ARE YOU ABLE TO COMMENT ON WHY THERE'S SUCH A DISCREPANCY- IN THAT FIGURE. SURE EIGHT YEAH D. B. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRESS AND A PUBLIC CASES THAT ARE AMONG LATINOS AND THEIR SHARE POPULATION IS A- IT IS SEVERE ENOUGH ACROSS ALL AGES BUT PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO ARE SIXTY FIVE TO SEVENTY NINE. AND A- I THINK A LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE IS ONE DRIVER OF THE OF THE TRANS RESTING HERE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE SOLE DRIVER OCCUPATIONAL RISKS ARE ANOTHER DRIVER- HOW DID HOUSING AND IS ANOTHER RISK FACTOR FOR CO THAT- ED THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT UNDERLIE THIS BUT BUT HEALTH INSURANCE IS ONE OF THEM. AND THEN THE MECHANISM BY WHICH HEALTH INSURANCE COULD AFFECT COULD. SPREAD AND COPE WITH THE DEATH RATES AS IS THAT WE KNOW FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCH THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED. AND IN THAT CASE A COVETED THAT'S COULD BE TESTING OR- FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY FEEL SICK WITH KOBE- IN GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE AND- WHEN PEOPLE. ARE HESITANT TO GET TESTING BECAUSE. OF COST A- YOU KNOW THEY- END UP AS A SPREADING IN THE AFFECTS ALL OF US AND- I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES THE QUESTION. IT'S CLOSE BUT I REALLY WANT TO DIG IN HERE A LITTLE BIT IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF COMBAT DEATHS FOR LATINO SENIORS AND- MY QUESTION IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE UNDERLYING HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT LACK OF PREVENTIVE CARE IS IT THAT. THEY HAVE UNTREATED DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION AND THAT WHEN THEY THEN GET COVE AND THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO GET SICKER AND DIE SOONER IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING BORN OUT IN THE STATE IS THAT- A TREND CONSISTENT. I THINK THAT. WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS DEFINITELY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR- A. EIGHT. D. A. I THINK A LOT MORE RESEARCH WOULD HAVE TOBE DONE SAID J. IDENTIFIED LIKE HOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH. THE LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE IS DRIVING THESE. DISPARITIES BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. LET ME TRY AND APPROACH THE QUESTION AND FROM A DIFFERENT AND AN ECONOMIC WAY IF I CAN- DOES IT COST CALIFORNIA MORE OR LESS TO MAKE THE UP FRONT INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE TO PEOPLE. AS AN EXAMPLE DOES THE UP FRONT INVESTMENT RESULT IN SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN WHAT IT. MAKES SENSE FOR US TO BE INVESTING IN PREVENTATIVE CARE SO WE DON'T HAVE THEIR UNDERLYING DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION THE OUT OF CONTROL AND HAVE THESE. OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES THAT WE'RE SEEING. I THINK THE BEST RESULTS YEAR EXPANDS MEDICAL REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS THAT IT WILL IMPROVE PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE- AND THEREFORE IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES. A IT WILL REQUIRE SOME STATE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE THEY USE MORE CARE- AND THAT'S AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WHICH IS AS REDUCING BARRIERS TO CARE BASED ON ON COSTS AND INSURANCE STATUS I AM. THERE IS CERTAINLY ARE ARE CASES WHERE- IT. HEALTH EXPENDITURES WILL BE LOWER WHEN YOU GET THE PREVENTATIVE CARE YOU NEED BUT THERE ARE ALSO CASES WHERE- HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES COULD BE HIGHER BUT THE OUTCOMES ARE BETTER. LOOK AT THE CANCER SCREENING THEY NEED AT THE RIGHT TIME- IT MAY IDENTIFY MORE CANCER CASES BUT WE'LL SEE PEOPLE LIVING LONGER HEALTHIER LIVES WHICH IS ULTIMATELY THE CALL. AND I ALSO AM. SEE THISAS A INVESTMENT AND REDUCING INEQUITY IN THE STATE- THE BIGGEST GROUPS OF UNINSURED. BY ELIGIBILITY STATUS OF COURSE AS I SAID IN MY PRESENTATION ARE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BUT WHEN WE COME AS- A CALIFORNIANS ARE. ANOTHER BIG GROUP OF UNINSURED AS ARE LATINO CALIFORNIANS AND SO- EXPANDING MEDIC HOW WOULD TAKE SOME STATE INVESTMENT BUT IT WOULD BE- AND INVESTMENT INDIVIDUALS WHO CURRENTLY LACK COVERAGE TODAY WHICH HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT BENEFITS US ALL AND IT WOULD ALSO BE AN INVESTMENT. IN REDUCING INEQUITIES. IF I COULD BRING YOU BACK TO THIS. THAN I WAS HOPING THAT- YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT HOW YOU ARE RECOMMENDING TO TAKE STEPS TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. ARE YOU RECOMMENDING A PHASED IN APPROACH STARTING WITH SENIORS THIS YEAR AND IF SO WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT PHASES. THANK YOU AT CHAIR AROUND OF THAT QUESTION I THINK WE HAVE LOOKED AT SENIORS BEING THE DOWN PAYMENT AND THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED THAT SEVERAL TIMES OVER THIS YEAR. I AND AS FAR AS WHERE THE NEXT STEPS GO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND SEE WHERE THEIR HEADS ARE AT AND WHERE THEY THINK IS THE BEST QUALITIES POLICY DECISION. FOR THE AND DOCUMENTED POPULATION. IF I COULD I NOW WANT TO BRING IT TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND TO- DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN AND- HI I WAS STRUCK DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN THAT THIS IS THE LARGEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM WE HAVE AND- I THINK THAT'S A POWERFUL STATEMENT ANYONE AYE- THINK IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU REPRESENT UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY LIKE MINE WHO YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET FOR US TO EFFECTIVELY WORK ON ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALSO HELPING ARE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY MATTERS FOR MANY OF US HERE ON THE DYESS. BUT I WANTED TO TALK IF I COULD ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF OUR STATE A LITTLE BIT WE'RE NOT BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE AND WANTED TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE CASELOAD NUMBER BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCY BETWEEN OUR CURRENT CASELOAD AND THE PROJECTIONS THAT WE ARE TO GROW INTO AND- I. WONDERING IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON WHERE THOSE SAVINGS WILL BE GOING AND WHETHER THEY COULD BE RE DIRECTED TOWARDS HELPING TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES WE SAW DURING THE PANDEMIC- YOU TAKE A SHOT OF. ALONG WITH- ALL FIRST HOUSE. J. C. MENTIONED NO MENTION- WE WILL BE A- AT THE MAYOR OF THOSE WILL BE LOOKING OLD TRIANGLE. ALL A SUDDEN IN MY REMOTE WERE BROUGHT OF. DRIVERS IMPACT THAT YEP WHY I REMAIN ON. WELL I'M- TURNING TO THE CORE ARE WHERE WE'RE GO- IF ABOUT. YOUR THINGS TO SAID ABOUT AND X. LITTLE IN ANYWAY BECAUSE THAT I THINK IS THERE IS NOW SEEMS TO ME SORT OF A HUMAN APPRECIATE. OF THE NEED FOR HEALTH COVERAGE PEOPLE ALL WAS WELL BEFORE IT'S NOT IN NOW. WELL AND DOZENS NISMAN'S TWO ARE BROKEN. ALL ON ENSURE POPULATION INCOME LARGISH BURKE OF THE CORNER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON. WHAT I THINK IS OUR SHARED FOLDER WITH DESIRE OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE ALL. SO LET ME STOP. I'M ONE OF THOSE LINES THEN I WON'T SLOWLY GO AND LOOK AT CASELOAD GROWTH I WILL ALSO IDENTIFY THAT- MISS ROUTE REVAL FROM- SHOULD COVER CALIFORNIA TALKED ABOUT SAVINGS FROM THE FEDERAL SUPPORT AND 410026100% AS WELL AS THE INCREASED F. MAP THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AS WELL AS THE WINDFALL THAT OUR STATE IS GOING THROUGH THERE ARE MULTIPLE AVENUES FOR US TO HAVE A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION THAT THAT I THINK THE QUESTION FOR MANY OF US IS WHEN. WE'RE PUSHING AND MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION- WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WHEN I OPENED. AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO STOPPABLE BY LANE ALL THE CLEARLY THOSE ARE STILL THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE LEADERSHIP. SPOKE FROM THE B. WHILE BE HAPPY EARLY THAT LOS OUR COUNTY ALL. TO GET YOU KNOW TO THAT PLACE SOME POINT WHERE WE CAN SEE WE HAVE YOU. YOU WALK THROUGH WHAT CALL MEANS THE THAT SEEKS. I THINK I HEAR YOU LIGHT AND- HAPPY FOR ALL OF US TO THE STAY WITH OUR OWN LANE- DO THINK I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE UP THE URGENCY THAT MANY OF US ARE FEELING FROM THIS PANDEMIC WE- OUR HOME AND- HEAR LOUDLY FROM OUR COMMUNITIES THE STRUGGLE THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW AND- REALLY BELIEVE- THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING. TOGETHER AND COLLABORATIVE LEE IS IMPORTANT AND- MOVES OUR STATE FORWARD AND ULTIMATELY IT IS- HOW WE TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO ARE VULNERABLE AND HAVE NEEDS RIGHT NOW THAT ALL OF US WILL BE REMEMBERED AND- DO YOU WANT TO. THANKS A LOT I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE BOTH HERE. WELL I STILL- I'VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE DIRECTOR AND TO AS WELL AS YOUR CANDOR DURING THIS DISCUSSION. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD PANEL ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON THE PANEL TO. STERLITE BORN YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF LEADING OFF PANEL TO. YES ALONG WE SENT TO MATURITY WELL. THE PANEL COURSES REGARDING OUR PROPOSED TRAILER BILL TO- ALL. PENALTIES FOR IMPROPER DISCHARGES- LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES- THE BACKGROUND HERE IS CLEARLY WE RECOGNIZE THE ISSUE RESOLVED ALL SO THE TRANSFERS DISCHARGES READMISSIONS CAN BE A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE- BUT RESIDENTS IN THESE FACILITIES AND DEVELOP VERY VULNERABLE- ALONG AND THEIR CARE CAN BE CHALLENGING AND FACILITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WOULD DEPEND ON. SERVICES POURTANT INSTEAD QUOTE. FEDERAL MEDICAID LAW STIPULATES- THE SINGLE STATE AGENCY JUST YET COS IS REQUIRED TO CONDUCT THEIR HEARINGS OR RESIDENTS WHO BELIEVE. OFTEN TRANSFERRED JUST DISCHARGED OR REFUSE NATIONAL USUALLY FROM OF ALL HOSPITALS- AND THE HEARINGS ARE TO PROVIDE YOU CROSS BOTH THE RESIDENT I AM FROM THE FACILITIES- TO MAKE THE CASE OF THE FULFILL RESPONSIBILITIES. WE CURRENTLY CONDUCT A COUPLE HUNDRED OF THESE HEARINGS ANNUAL MOST OF WHICH ARE DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE RESIDENT. ALL JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE ARE LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE REASONS ON. THE LONG TERM CARE FACILITY CAN DISCHARGE HOME A RESIDENT- CENTRALLY. ALL RESIDENTS NEEDS CAN'T BE MET ASSEMBLY. HOWEVER THE FACILITY IS RESPONSIBLE. THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR DISCHARGE PLANNING TO OCCUR. ONE IS WHERE THE PRESIDENT WILL NOW SAY R. O. THERE IS LOCAL CALLED SOMEWHERE ELSE- HOME SO THIS HOSPITAL CONSCIOUSLY BROWN. ARTICOLI WE RECEIVED COMPLAINTS ALL- ABOUT HOME FAILURE FACILITIES TO COMPLY WITH OUR HEARING DECISION- AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO ENFORCEABLE- AUTHORITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY ALL OF THOSE COMPLAINTS. BE COMPOSED CURRENTLY BILL SEEKS TO REMEDY THAT WELCOME. CONTINUE TO SORT OF WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS BOTH WARM CAMERON TRIAL. SPACE AROUND WHAT- IT'S SOMETHING WE- ALL- IN TERMS OF QUESTIONS WHICH BARS- WE CAN ACCOUNT FROM AND SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN. WELL BOROUGH. HE DID NOT OWN- ACTIONAL BEHALF OF THE DISPOSE. AND WE ONLY KNOW THOSE CURRENTLY IF IS INFORMATION IS BROUGHT BACK SO THAT MAYBE MORE OPEN. SURE BUT CERTAIN. TO- CHECK THE NUMBER BHOSLE IS STRUGGLING TO- AND SO OF LAWS THE SOLDIER BEHAVE IT'S NOT. CREATE A REVENUE STREAM ALL WE WOULD BE MORE. HAPPY IF- AS A OF WE NEVER HAD THE OPERATOR TO ALONG COLLEGE. OR MMHM. BUT THE PROCESS WITH- HE HEARING IS GOING TO BY A LONG TERM WILL TRAIN THE HEARING- RESIDENT AND LOCAL SO THE ALL CAN INTRODUCE EVIDENCE BEFORE CUSTOMER EXAMINING CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES- IN ORDER TO AVAIL THE FACILITY MUST SHOW THAT THE- FOLLOWING FEDERAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. TO DISCHARGE RESIDENT. THERE'S A LEGAL REASON REASON FOR CRIMES DOCUMENTS. RESIDENTS MEDICAL WORKERS THE FACILITY UNDER WILL DISCHARGE PLANNING TO ENSURE CYNICAL FORMALLY DISCHARGED. SHORTLY PROVIDED WRITTEN NOTICE OF TRANSFER AND DISCHARGE ALL RECORD CONTENT INCLUDING BOOSTING THE LOCATION TO WHICH. IS BEING DESTROYED- RESIDENTS TYPICALLY WORK THEMSELVES THIS YEAR OKAY EARLY FAMILY MEMBER. OR TABLET WILL BE- PERSONAL TYPICALLY WORK WAS SO WITH THEIR OWN. ASIAN WITH TURNS OUT MOST RECENTLY- BY PHONE- SHOWS. B. HEARINGS- WE'RE ARE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL STATE MORE ON NOT THIS AS FORMAL. WHICH ARE COULD NOT. WHERE ONE OF THE JUDGES THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ON BECAUSE OF WE ALL THIS FOR A LONG TIME MAINTENANCE- IN ORDER. TO SURE DANGER A VERY. IN REAL TIME SO WITH THAT BUT WILL TOOK AND ARE PRO. WEST NEXT ON MY LIST OF PRESENTERS I JC FOLLOW BY AMY BLOOM BURKE. I DON'T THINK J. C. ACTING US ALMOST. GENERAL AND- AT MAXWELL AMY BLOOMBERG. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ANY BLOOMBERG WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES REPRESENTING OVER NINE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES. SERVING PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ACROSS THE STATE. CAMPUS OPPOSED TO DH CS IS BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT WILL PLACE NEW ADDITIONAL FINES ON FACILITIES THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH TRANSFER OR DISCHARGE HEARING DECISIONS. CALF AS OPPOSED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS NUMBER ONE TRANSPORTERS ARE CHALLENGING AND COMPLEX ISSUE AS HAS BEEN STATED ALREADY THESE HAPPEN VERY RARELY AND ARE OFTEN DONE BECAUSE A PATIENT POSES A SAFETY RISK TO OTHER RESIDENTS AND STAFF. FACILITIES HAD VERY FEW TOOLS TO ADDRESS RESIDENTS WHO ARE VIOLENT AND CHILLS AT RISK. NUMBER TWO THE CURRENT HEARING PROCESS IS BROKEN AND A NICE TO PROCESS TO FACILITIES HEARING OFFICERS AT THESE INFORMAL HEARINGS NOT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AND THE UNDERLYING REASON WHY FACILITY IS SEKING TO TRANSFER OR DISCHARGE A PATIENT IS NOT CONSIDERED. ONLY WHETHER A FACILITY HAS FOLLOWED THE APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IS REVIEWED IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS PROCESS MORE FAIR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES SHOULD OVERSEE THESE HEARINGS AND THE REASON FOR THE JUST CHARGE THE COR SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES REQUIRED UNDER THE FEDERAL DOUBLE FEDERAL. REGULATIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. PENALTIES THE EIGHT S. C. M. S. RT THE TO SIGN FACILITY FOR PHILLY TO WITH TRANSFERRED TO CHARGE HEARING DECISIONS THIS PROPOSAL AS A NAIL FINE AGAINST FACILITIES THAT IS TWENTY TIMES THE CURRENT FINE ASSESSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE ALREADY PROVIDES FOR A FIFTY DOLLAR PER DAY FINE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIRES THE FACILITIES AT TAKE THEIR RESIDENT BACK IN ORDER TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL PLAN OF CORRECTION AND THE FACILITY REFUSES TO DO SO ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CAN ISSUE A BI LEVEL CITATION UNDER HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR ET. AND FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE EIGHT FOUR WITH A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF APPROPRIATE. CAN QUESTIONS THAN FOR G. TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL I PENALTY. AND ESPECIALLY A THOUSAND PER DAY WHICH IS TWENTY TIMES HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PENALTY. NUMBER FOUR WE BELIEVE THIS IS A POLICY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED AND POLICY COMMITTEE AND NOT IN A TRAILER AND A BUDGET TRAILER BILL. IN TERMS OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED. TO DESCRIBE THE MOST COMMON SITUATIONS THAT CAUSE FACILITIES TO VIOLATE TO DH CS ORDERS TO ADMIT OUR READMIT PATIENTS THESE SITUATIONS HAPPEN VERY RARELY MOST COMMON SITUATIONS ARE WHEN A RESIDENT MAY HAVE A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUE AND ESTHER AND TWO OR HARM TO ANOTHER RESIDENT OR STAFF MEMBER. OTHER SITUATIONS ARE WHEN A RESIDENT NO LONGER NEED SKILLED NURSING CARE BUT REFUSES TO LEAVE THE FACILITY THERE ARE SOME RESIDENTS THAT DISAGREE WITH THE NOTICE OF JUST CHARGE THEY RECEIVE THAT MAY BE RELATED TO FAILURE TO PAY FOR CARE OR NO LONGER REQUIRING THE LEVEL OF CARE. PHYSICIAN MUST CERTIFY FOR. THE SECOND. DESCRIBE WAYS IN WHICH THE HEARING PROCESS AT DH CS COULD BE CHANGED. AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE OVERSEE A FORMAL TRANSFER DISCHARGE HEARING. AND ADDITION THE RATIONALE FOR WHY THEIR RESIDENT IS BEING TRANSFERRED OR DISCHARGED WITH THE COURSE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES- UNDER THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL REGULATION LIKE TO SEE THOSE CONSIDERED. NOT JUST WHETHER AT THE FACILITY HAS COMPLETED THE APPROPRIATE KEEPER BURKE. AND NUMBER THREE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS PATIENT SOMETHING THAT GOES ON- AND THE SKILLED NURSING PROFESSION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. NO THERE'S NOT AN ISSUE OF PATIENT DUMPING THERE ARE SOME RESIDENTS THAT DISAGREE WITH THE NOTICE OF JUST CHARGE AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. THAT THEY RECEIVE THAT MAY BE RELATED TO FAILURE TO PAY FOR CARE OR NO LONGER REQUIRING THE LEVEL OF CARE THAT A PHYSICIAN MUST CERTIFY FOR. WE BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS THE LACK OF CARE AND SERVICES TO SUPPORT THOSE WITH DEMENTIA AND OTHER NEUROBEHAVIORAL DISORDERS THAT RESULTS AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS TOWARDS OTHER RESIDENTS AND THE VERY STAFF THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE CARE. ALSO WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS THE LACK OF HOUSING FOR TRANSIENT INDIVIDUALS THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ACCEPT AN ORDER SIX LAST ASSIST HOSPITALS. FOR SHORT TERM CARE AND THERE NOT BEING ANY SAFE PLACE TO DISCARGE THEM FALLING TREATMENTS AND THEY'RE LEFT WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE. CHARGE OF LOCATION. WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT WHICH WE- APPRECIATED AND HOPE TO CONTINUE. TO WORK ON THIS. HAVE A PROCEED AT THE CONVERSATION THUS FAR. THANK YOU WITHOUT A WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS AND SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUNS THANK YOU UP MISTER CHAIR- AND FOR AMY AND HER- DISCUSSION JUST A FOLLOW UP ON THE- LACK OF HOUSING TO START DISCHARGE. OF PATIENTS TO IS THAT. ALSO A CAUSE FOR- BACKING UP THE BED SPACE OR SPACE- WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S ITSELF BECAUSE OF. NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT HOUSING EXTERNALLY. YES I BELIEVE THAT'S ALL THE. WITHOUT SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL TO WE WILL MOVE ON THE PANEL THREE ON SUSPENSIONS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PAYMENTS AND MEDICARE ALL OPTIONAL BENEFITS WE HAVE THREE PRESENTERS DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN J. C. COOPER AND COREY HARSHA WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. DIRECTOR ALLY BORN PLEASE BEGIN. WE CORRECT GEN LISTICLE BURKE. SO CURRENT LAW CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF A NUMBER OF PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND A NUMBER OF OPTIONAL BENEFITS AT THE END OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET GENERALLY- PROPOSES TO DELAY THOSE SUSPENSION DATES BY ONE YEAR SAW WALK THROUGH THE CURRENT PROPOSED SAYS THAT- NEW DATES OF JULY OF TWENTY TWO OR POSITIONS DENTAL NONEMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION TRAUMA SCREENINGS DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AND VALUE BASED PAYMENTS. OZ'S NEW SUSPENSION DATE OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR ICF D.'S FREE STANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE AND R. C. BASS ITEMS. THERE'S NO PROPOSED SUSPENSION FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH FAMILY PLANNING LOAN REPAYMENTS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INCENTIVE OF COOL. BUT AIDS HIV WAIVER HOME HEALTH AND PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE- ALSO WOULD KNOW THAT THE POST PARTUM ELIGIBILITY- EXTENSION IS THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWO. AT ALL OPTIONAL BENEFITS THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWO INCLUDING AUDIOLOGY AND SPEECH THERAPY- AND OTHER ODD OPTIONAL BENEFITS PROVISIONAL POSTPARTUM CARE EXTENSION- IN WOULD NOTE THAT THE EXPANSION OF SCREENING FOR ADDITIONAL SUBSTANCES ALSO KNOWN AS EXPERT. I'M HAS BEEN MOVED TO A PREVENTATIVE SERVICE UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND THEREFORE REQUIRED TO COVER. IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. REGARDING ANY RATIONALE JUSTIFICATION FOR HAVING THE SUSPENSIONS- IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET YOU WILL- DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN REGARDS TO THAT QUESTION THIS CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS. NEXT WE HAVE HARSH ENOUGH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK AFTER ARAMBULA KOREAN SHEET WITH THE AUDIO- AS AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA FOR THIS HEARING OUR OFFICES PUBLISHED ANALYSIS- DISCUSSING THE SUSPENSIONS ACROSS THE BUDGET GENERALLY- NOT JUST NOT JUST ENGAGE THE ASTON AND MEDICARE BUT ACROSS ACROSS THE BUDGET- IN WHICH WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE NEW BUDGET BILL SUSPENSION FINDINGS FROM OUR OUR OUR POST WE FIND THAT MOST OF THE SUSPENSION ITEMS. FUNDED CORE STATE SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE TREATED AS ONGOING COSTS- AND NOT AS TEMPORARY COST AS THE SUSPENSION MECHANISM MAKES THEM. WE ALSO FIND THAT- THE SUSPENSIONS CREATE UNCERTAINTY FOR PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS OF SERVICES FOR THE PROGRAMS- POTENTIALLY AFFECTED BY THE SUSPENSIONS- WHICH COULD SORT OF HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON ON SERVICE DELIVERY- WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ARE OUR CONCERNS WITH THE SUSPENSIONS ARE WITH THE MECHANISM OF. SUSPENSION SPECIFICALLY- MEANING THAT OUR OUR RECOMMENDATION TO REJECT A NEW SUSPENSION LANGUAGE DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE STATE FROM ASSESSING WHICH SUSPENSION ITEM SHOULD CONTINUE GOING FORWARD- YOU KNOW WE SORT OF A DREAM- YOU KNOW IN OUR IN OUR POST WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE REALITIES OF SORT OF THE MULTI YEAR- CHALLENGES THAT THE STATE WILL FACE WITH HIS FISCAL SITUATION AND- WE VIEW THAT- WE'VE YOU ADDRESSING THE YOU KNOW THE STATE'S. FISCAL FUTURE IN THE MULTI YEAR AS SOMETHING THAT CAN ASSIST THEM THAT CAN OCCUR SEPARATELY- FROM THAT FROM THE SUSPENSION MECHANISM SPECIFICALLY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE RAISE ISSUES WITH- THAT SORT OF CONCLUDES OUR OUR OFFICES. THANK VERY MUCH MEMBERS AND QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE I DO HAVE WHAT FOR THE DEPARTMENT- JC COOPER I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF FIGHT COULD ABOUT WITH THE SUSPENSIONS WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE THAT PROP FIFTY SIX REACHES ITS FULL POTENTIAL IN TERMS OF ATTRACTING AND RETAINING PROVIDERS INTO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. COULD WE DO BETTER WITH MORE CERTAIN LONG TERM PROVIDER RATES AND SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. WELL WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT- YOU KNOW MEDIC CALIFORNIANS THING IS VERY COMPLICATED- WE HAVE A BASE RATES- AND THEN WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF. A BOTH SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS WELL AS DIRECTED PAYMENTS ARM AND VARIOUS- MECHANISMS IN WHICH AND HOW WE PAY FOR OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM- AND SO I THINK WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO EVALUATE HOW WE CAN ENSURE WE HAVE. A NETWORK ADEQUACY FOR ALL OF OUR BENEFITS YEARS IN REGARDS TO APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO BOTH PROVIDERS OF DENTAL SERVICES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES THAT- ARE RECEIVING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FROM PROP FIFTY SIX. I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T SEE- CERTAIN PIECES- BEING HIGHLIGHTED ADDS NOT SUBJECT TO SUSPENSION AND OR AREAS WHERE WE DON'T EEN FEEL LIKE CMS WOULD ALLW FOR- THE TRANSITION OUT OF SUCH POP- YOU KNOW SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS BECAUSE OF HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OF ALL PROPERTY SIX PIECES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AS WE CONTINUE THOSE EVALUATIONS. I WILL SIMPLY STATES- THE FITS AND STARTS MAKE. COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THOSE PROVIDERS TO IMPLEMENT. EFFECTIVELY AND- FOR BETTER LONG TERM PLANNING WOULD BE NICE TO GIVE THEM THAT CLARITY- BUT- WITH THAT I WILL TURN OVER QUESTIONS TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU I'M BEING THAT- WE'VE BEEN IN LAW THIS IS MY FOURTH YEAR ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THEN. THIS WHOLE- SOME SUSPENSION NON SUSPENSION IS REALLY CONFUSING AND- THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD OR THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO YOU KNOW I PUT MY SITUATION- MYSELF IN THE OF THE PLACE OF FOLKS. KIND OF IN MY OWN PERSONAL BUDGET- AND MY OWN KIND OF INCOME AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAN- YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LOOKING FORWARD IF THEY'RE UNDER THREAT OF. IT'S BEEN SUSPENDED NOT SUSPENDED YOU KNOW. AGAIN IT'S VERY CONFUSING. BUT I THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE PROVIDERS pPAYMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE- THE SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER WE DONT SUSPENDED OR SUSPENDED HOWEVER WE WANT TO SAY IT BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S REALLY CONFUSING BUT THE POINT IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THESE PAYMENTS- ARE STEADY SO THAT- NOT ONLY THE PROVIDERS CAN PLAN FOR THE FUTURE BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE SOME ASSURANCES THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET. THOSE SERVICES AS BY MAKING SURE THAT PROVIDERS. HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES- SO IT'S AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND I THINK. YOU KNOW IN SOME INSTANCES I THINK IT'S ON PURPOSE I'M NOT SAYING BAGHDAD. THAT THAT. THIS IS INTENTIONAL HOWEVER THE CONFUSION. S. IS ARE NOT JUST FOR ME BUT I THINK FOR OUR FOLKS THEY NEED THOSE SERVICES. ONE ONE. YEAR THEY CAN GET SERVICES THE NEXT YEAR THEY CAN'T AND SO. WE NEED SOME STABILITY AND I'M PLEADING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND I'M PLANNING WITH WITH THE YOU KNOW KIND OF ANYBODY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT. WE CAN'T. OF HAVE THESE ISSUES HANGING OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS BECAUSE IN THE SERVICES ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED- TO LOOK AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT SERVICE IS NOT ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED TO OUR COMMUNITY SO. AGAIN I PLEAD WITH ALL OF US TO KEEP TRYING AND YOU KNOW COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT ASSURES A PROVIDERS THAT THEY WILL GET PAID. APPROPRIATELY MOVING FORWARD WE YOU KNOW OUR OUR FISCAL- SITUATION IS GOOD AND IT'S PROJECTED TO NOT BE THAT GREAT. BUT IF WE DON'T PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITY THEN. WE HAVE A REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES AT STAKE YOUR SOUL THANK YOU. THE DOCTOR WOULD. THANK END THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPRESENTATION HI I WONDER HAS THE DEPARTMENT EVER CONSIDERED LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS FOR EXAMPLE A COUPLE OF YEARS INSTEAD OF A SINGLE YEAR- YOU KNOW YEAH I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE HISTORY I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THE HISTORY THAT. THAT SENSUALLY THE STAKEHOLDERS TO PUT PROP FIFTY SIX TOGETHER WE'RE TOLD THAT YOU KNOW THERE REALLY ISN'T MONEY IN THE STATE BUDGET TEAM INCREASE RATES AND SO. THE CHALLENGE WAS TO GO OUT AND FIND REVENUE SOURCE WHICH THEY DID AND PASS THIS PASSED AS PROPOSITION. WHICH HAS NOW BEEN YOU KNOW USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS- NOT ALWAYS TO THE INTENT OF THAT WELL WHAT HOW IT WAS WRITTEN. SO KNOWING THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S CHALLENGING TO GET PROVIDERS TO PARTICIPATE LONG TERM. IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD NOT LOOK AT THIS AS A LINE ITEM BUT LOOK AT IT IN WHOLE MORE HOLISTICALLY. AS AN INVESTMENT IN TREATING THE MOST NEEDY POPULATION OF OUR STATE. AND LOOK AT THIS AND FIND CONSIDER FINDING THIS ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS. ALL THE PARTS YOU ARE COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS LININGS THE- SUSPENSIONS ARE AN EXTENSION OF THE STATE LIGHTS SUSPENSIONS REMARKS. BY THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION WILL MARK MY WORDS BACK WORKABLE ISN'T STANDING AT BY ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT AND NOT. WHAT ARE YOUR THE L. A. O. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY WE ARE THE STATE APPEARS TO BE FIGHTING FOR A LARGE BUDGET DEFICITS WALMART SUSPENSIONS REMARKED AS NECESSARY TO MITIGATE THIS BUDGET. BUDGET DEFICITS. BRING SEASONS FROM FRAMEWORK RESULT IN THE STATE OF THE- TO MAKE THE SOLDIERS AND. APOLOGIES COMMITTEE IDENTIFY YOURSELF. START OUT WORKING APART THANK YOU SIR. SO BUT BUT I WOULD GUESS IT WAS THAT EVEN WHEN WE GOOD YEAR. THE THERE WAS NO IT TO AT IT THIS WAY IT'S IT THAT OFTEN JUST FEELS LIKE IT'S A- IT'S ALMOST A- OF THIS SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE. STE SPENT IN A WAY THAT'S YOU KNOW. YOU'VE CLEARLY HEARD THE REAL LEGISLATURE LEASE THIS COMMITTEE HAS STRONG DESIRE TO SEE HOW THIS IS SPENT AND ALLOCATED. YET EVEN IN THE GOOD YEARS. THAT YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THIS OVER A MULTI YEAR BASIS NEVER HAPPENED AND NOW WE CAN USE THE PROJECTIONS OF THE FUTURE AS A WAY TO FURTHER FORCED ALL THAT- I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE PROVIDER BASE THAT THAT SERVES THESE NEEDY POCKET THIS NEEDY POPULATION. NEEDS STABILITY AND- AND PART OF THAT STABILITY LEADS TO BETTER QUALITY CARE MORE TIMELY CARE AND POTENTIALLY LESS COST TO THE STATE OF PEOPLE KING. DICTUM WE GET THE CARE THEY NEED FROM TRUSTED PROVIDERS WHEN THEY NEED IT SO SON CERTAINTY. IS NOT HELPFUL AND WHILE YOU MAY THINK AS THE DEPARTMENT THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW WILL SOUND WAY OF BUDGETING THINGS. FROM A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE IT'S REALLY NOT AND- AND I WOULD JUST IMPLORE. THE DEPARTMENT AT SOME POINT ON THIS ISSUE AND OTHERS TO NOT NECESSARILY LOOK AT THESE AS LINE ITEMS LOOK AT THEM AT THE HUMAN IMPACT AND THE PROPHETIC CARE IMPACT THAT'S HAPPENING FOR PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW THAT'S A BIG PARADIGM SHIFT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT OTHER THINGS OUT THERE YOU KNOW PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT OFTEN GET PUSHED ASIDE- THIS IS JUST. THE UNCERTAINTY IS LEADING TO A POTENTIALLY UNCERTAINTY AMONG PROVIDERS AND POTENTIALLY POOR OUTCOMES WHICH IN THE LONG RUN ACROSS ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE STATE MORE MONEY. SO I'M JUST AT SOME POINT YEAH CAN WE CHANGE THE PARADIGM A LITTLE BIT AND LOOK AT THESE THINGS MORE HOLISTICALLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. I JUST WANT A SECOND DOCTOR WAS MOTION. TO LOOK AT THIS- MORE HOLISTICALLY. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE ARE NO VOTES HERE TODAY. TAKING NO MOTIONS- BUT I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO THANK PANEL THREE AS WE MOVE ON THE PANEL FOR.
