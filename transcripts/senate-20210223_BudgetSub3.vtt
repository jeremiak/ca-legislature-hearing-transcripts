SORT OF OPTIMISTIC GROWTH

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.124
ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

ABOUT. HIS SLOW GROWTH AMONG

00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:26.472

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:39.218
OPTIMISTIC GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS.

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:41.954
OUR OFFICE IS POINT IS NOT

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:45.391
THAT- YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:47.059
BETTER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:48.727
INFANTS AND TODDLERS IF THEY

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:50.563
WERE ABLE TO COME INTO THE

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.532
INTERVENTION SERVICES THAT CAN

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.034
REALLY HELP WITH LATER LIFE

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.069
OUTCOMES AND IN FACT IF THEY

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.270
ARE IF THEY WERE TO RECEIVE

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.306
THESE SERVICES THAT CAN NOT

00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:02.441
ONLY HELP- THEM ON AN

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:05.010
INDIVIDUAL BASIS BUT ALSO. IT

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:06.512
FROM A PHYSICAL PERSPECTIVE IT

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:07.713
CAN MEAN THAT THEY REQUIRE

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.648
FEWER SERVICES OR OVER THE

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:11.584
COURSE OF THE LIFESPAN WHICH

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.486
ALSO TRANSLATES INTO LOWER COST

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.689
FOR THE STATE- POINT REALLY IS

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:19.858
THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS IF THE

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:23.462
IF THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO-

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.497

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.299
TODDLERS BACK INTO THE SYSTEM.

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.701
ARE NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:31.804
HOPE IT COULD MEAN THAT COSTS

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.440
IN THE BUDGET YEAR- ARE

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.976
OVERSTATED AND WE TOOK A LOOK

CASELOAD GROWTH AND CONSIDERED.

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:41.680

POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF RE OPENING

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:47.486
AND WE ESTIMATE THAT COSTS IN

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:48.721
THE BUDGET COULD BE OVERSTATED

00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:50.522
IN THE BDGET YEAR BY AS MUCH

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:51.991
AS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

ARE LOOKING AT RECOVERY- BY

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:46.045
HAVING A REGIONAL CENTERS AND

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.046
WE TALKED TO THE REGIONAL

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:49.148
CENTER DIRECTORS- BECAUSE WE

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.016
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.886
INCREASED WORKLOAD OF. DOING

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.454

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.456
INDIVIDUALS ON- I'M IN A VERY

00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:00.859
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND WANTED

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:01.860
TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:06.198
TO- AND I HANDLE THAT WORKLOAD-

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:07.666
EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES THE

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:09.768
IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING KIDS ON

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:11.070
FOR SERVICES SKINNER THAN

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:13.339
LATER. ON AND IT REALLY HAS

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:15.674
BEEN MORE OF THIS ALL HANDS ON

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:17.976
DECK TO STATE THAT WE IT'S NOT

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:20.279
A MATTER OF CAN WE OR SHOULD WE

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.214
AS A MATTER WE NEED TO DO THIS-

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:24.283
SO THEY STARTED TO DO SOME OF

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.819
THE RECOVERY NOW- AND SO WHEN

00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:29.054
WE TAKE A LOOK AT BEING ABLE TO

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.623
BUILD. UP THE INTAKES AND

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.326
BRINGING KIDS ON. YOU MUST HAVE

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.495
A- COMMENT ABOUT WE ARE GOING

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:39.965
TO HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF NAY

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.567
REVISED IS STILL HOW WE'RE

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.902
DOING IN OUR RECOVERY BE ABLE

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:46.138
TO HAVE. A BETTER- KIND OF

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:49.608
CLARITY AND TO BE- PROJECTIONS

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:52.077
OR BUDGET YEAR- THANK BECAUSE

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.846
IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT AREA WE

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:54.380
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:56.248
REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE THOSE

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:59.084
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM- TO

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.953
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE- TO

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:02.354
CLINICIANS TO DO THE

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.489
ASSESSMENTS THAT THEY HAVE

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.257
THEIR EARLY START- STAFF

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.059
BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO REDUCE

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:09.928
THAT- OPERATIONS DOLLARS TO

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:11.397
REGIONAL CENTRES MAY BE PUT IN

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:13.198
A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE TO.

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:15.000
REDUCE THE STAFF THAT ARE

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:16.568
WORKING AN EARLY START AND THEN

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:18.871
SHOULD WE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:20.706
BRING MY KIDS ON. THAN WHAT

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:21.840
THEY HAD THE EFFECTIVE

00:17:21.907 --> 00:17:24.109
COORDINATION FOR SERVICES OR

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.245
WOULD WE THEN BE- REPLACING ONE

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:28.380
PROBLEM WITH ANOTHER- SO THAT'S

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:30.382
THAT WAS I'M TO THE POINT OF

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:32.484
HOW WE TOOK THIS APPROACH- IN

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:34.420
HIS PROPOSED BUDGET OKAY. CAN

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:35.654
YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.922
SINCE I THINK WE ALL

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:37.890
ACKNOWLEDGE AND GETTING KIDS

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:40.392
AND IS SOONER IS BETTER AND

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:41.994
THAT THE DROP OFF HAS BEEN

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:48.200
BECAUSE KIDS ARE BORN. THE

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:49.168
DOCTOR BUT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT A

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.402
NINETY YOU SEE YOU WERE THERE

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:51.937
DOING A- PUTTING SOME STUFF ON

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:52.571
THE WEBSITE BUT HOW ARE WE GO.

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.840
OUT MORE. AND I. THESE KIDS

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:55.674
BECAUSE OUGHT WE KNOW IF THE

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.042
COST WILL GET LARGER IF THEY

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:58.010
YOU KNOW THEY DO GET INTO. SOON

00:17:58.076 --> 00:17:59.244
ENOUGH IN THEN TRY TO. INTO AN

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:01.647
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT IS ALSO

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:02.648
RIGHT GOING THROUGH ITS OWN

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:04.683
STRUGGLES TRYING TO RE OPEN. SO

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.984
WHAT ARE WE DOING PROACTIVELY

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:07.853
TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS AND

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.321
FAMILIES ARE RECEIVING SERVICES

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:10.389
HAS BEEN A FOR EVERY CHILD AT

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.124
HOME NOT RECEIVING SERVICES.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:15.661
THAT'S EXTRA STRESS ON A FAMILY

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:16.228
THAT IS ALSO TRYING TO COPE

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:16.695
DURING THIS PANDEMIC.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.530
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THE

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.432
QUESTION- AND THAT'S WHERE THE

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:22.434
WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.871
THE- ICC WHICH- IS- REALLY A

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.372
GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS AS THE

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:28.207
INTERAGENCY COORDINATING

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:30.976
COUNCIL- AND THE WORK THAT THEY

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:34.079
DO. THEIR PROFESSIONALS THAT

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:36.648
ARE WITHIN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD.

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:38.450
DEVELOPMENT AND EARLY START

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:40.219
PROGRAMS- TO REALLY LOOKING

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:41.854
NICE THAT'S TO WHAT IT DOES

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.756
STRATEGIES- CHILD FIND HAS BEEN

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.258
ONE OF THE AREAS INTO HOW WE

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:47.593
COULD REALLY DO THAT OUT OF

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:50.028
REACH- AND AGAIN IT'S- KIND OF

00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:51.864
A MULTI SYSTEM APPROACH-

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.532
THERE'S BEEN AND EVEN UNDER

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.834
THE- ICC THEY'VE BEEN

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:56.835
DISTRIBUTING COMMUNITY

RESOURCES AND FIRES IN INFO

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.138

MULTIPLE LANGUAGE. IS ALSO

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:05.477

HAD- THE ICC I BELIEVE AND I

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:15.787
HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:18.290
THE CLARITY ON THAT- BUT THEY-

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:19.758
CAN'T. REALLY TOOK A LOOK AT A

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.394
PLAN TO DO PROACTIVE OUTREACH

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.796
BUT ALSO TO OUR REACH WITHIN

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:26.331
YOU KNOW HEALTH PLANS BUT THEN

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.500
ALSO LOOKING AT- WHAT ARE SOME

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:33.272
OF THE- KINDA EDUCATION AND-

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:35.541
OUTREACH TO PEDIATRICIANS- SO

WE HAD REACHED OUT TO THE

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:39.311
ASSOCIATION'S TO ALSO BE ABLE

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:40.546
TO RAISE AWARENESS WITHIN

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:42.881
PEDIATRICIANS. OF WE ALSO OOK

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.616
A LOOK AT HOW DO WE DO AVERAGE

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:45.951
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY BASED

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.453
ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE- WE ARE

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.389
VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT THOSE

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.190
THAT COULD BE GREATEST IMPACTED

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.259
OUR OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:57.529
WHICH WILL GREATER. IMPACT A

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:59.765
DISPARITY- OF THAT WE DON'T

00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:03.168
WANT TO CONTINUE TO- HAVE AND

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.536
PARTICULARLY IN THE AS PART IN

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:07.205
IN THIS AREA. SO IT MORE LIKE I

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:08.373
SAID WE HAVE THIS FOCUS GROUP

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.075
THAT HAS ALSO REVIEWING KIND OF

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:13.178
THE- KIDS THAT- WE NEED TO DO

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:14.446
SO OUR REGION PROACTIVE

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:17.149
APPROACH SO IT'S NOT. I OFTEN

00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:18.517
SAY THAT IN MANY OF THESE

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:21.119
EFFORTS IT CAN'T JUST BE ONE

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:23.388
EVENTS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:24.590
TAKE A LOOK AT ARE THEY

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:25.591
EFFECTIVE AND IF THEY'RE NOT

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:27.326
EFFECTIVE. WHAT ARE THE THINGS

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.660
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:36.201

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:30.854
REALLY BALANCE- SIMULTANEOUS

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:32.656

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:58.448
THEY NEED MORE WORK ACTUALLY AT

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.517
THIS TIME- THE DIRECTIVES THAT

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:01.652
THE DEPARTMENT HAS ISSUED HAVE

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:03.353
REALLY HELPED- SERVICE

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.155
PROVIDERS AND REGIONAL CENTERS

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.957
RESPOND IN A FLEXIBLE WAY TO

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:08.325
THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.861
CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES-

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:12.329
BUT IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN WITH

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:15.399
OUT. OF CHALLENGES- WE HAVE

00:47:15.465 --> 00:47:17.467
HEARD FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE

00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:18.468
DIRECTED AT SOME OF THE

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.304
DIRECTIVES MAY NOT BE.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.973
IMPLEMENTED IN AN ENTIRELY

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.908
CONSISTENT WAY ACROSS THE

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:27.010
TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS-

00:47:27.077 --> 00:47:28.178
FOR A COUPLE OF THEM THAT THERE

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:29.947
MIGHT BE SORT OF A LACK OF

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.582
CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THE

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.850
DIRECTIVE IS TRYING TO DO- OR

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:35.819
HOW TO HOW TO REALLY IMPLEMENT

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:38.422
THAT DIRECTIVE. AND THEN- THE

00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:40.023
POINT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON AT

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.159
THE MOMENT IS THAT THE DURATION

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:44.995
OF THE FLEXIBILITIES- MOST OF

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.964
THEM BEING IN PLACE FOR THIRTY

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.132
DAYS AT A TIME. HAS WE'VE HEARD

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:51.335
THAT THIS IS CREATED- A LOT OF

00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:54.538
UNCERTAINTY DURING WHAT IS

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:55.872
ALREADY AN UNCERTAIN TIME- AND

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:57.874
THIS IS COUPLED WITH ALSO

00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:00.244
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT A POSSIBLE

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.879
SUSPENSION OF- SUPPLEMENTAL

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:04.348
PROVIDER RATES WHICH WILL

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:05.882
REALLY WE WILL ADDRESS IN THE

00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:09.386
NEXT ISSUE- AT THE HEARING

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:12.122
TODAY. AND THE GENERAL LACK OF

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:13.523
INFORMATION ABOUT READ REFORM

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.726
GOING FORWARD. SO WHAT ONE

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:17.461
THING THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IS

00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:19.062
THAT IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:21.331
CONSIDER WHICH DIRECTIVES AND

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:24.167
FLEXIBILITIES- MIGHT BE

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.603
EXTENDED AT LEAST THROUGH THE

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:27.137

NOTED THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:32.442
IS ALREADY CONSIDERING SORT OF

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:34.711
A LONG TERM- USE OF SOME OF

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.713
THESE DIRECTIVES BUT- I'M SORT

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.049

MAY BE HELPFUL TO THE SERVICE

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:45.789
PROVIDER. COMMUNITY AND WE ALSO

00:48:45.856 --> 00:48:47.624
JUST SUGGESTED THAT- THE

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:49.159
LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:50.360
ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:52.195
REGIONAL CENTERS TO ENSURE THAT

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.298
THERE'S EVEN APPLICATION OF

00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:57.267
THESE DIRECTIVES ACROSS THE

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.368

THE DEPARTMENT IS AWARE THAT-

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:12.049
THE THIRTY DAY EXTENSION SOME

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:14.251
HAVE BEEN- DIFFICULT FOR OUR

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:17.187
COMMUNITY- WITH THE EXECUTIVE

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:19.056

EXECUTIVE ORDER. WE ARE LIMITED

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:23.427

TO- GET THOSE EXTENSIONS OUT AS

QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HISTORY AT

30 DEGREES JUST POSSIBLE AND

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.302
WE'RE CONTINUING TO REFINE THAT

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:34.571
PROCESS- THE DIRECTORS THAT ARE

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:37.341

THOSE DO NOT HAVE A THIRTY DAY.

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:47.818

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:54.991

THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:55.271
NUMEROUS- BUT I WOULD POINT TO

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:57.140
ONE IN PARTICULAR AND THAT IS

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:58.875
THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:00.310

GENERALLY SPEAKING IN MY

OPINION THE DIRECTIVES ISSUED

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:19.262
BY THE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.798
EXTREMELY HELPFUL. FOR EXAMPLE

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:23.933
ALLOWING SERVICE COORDINATION

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.052
IN MY OPINION THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.487
LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:45.121

GOING FORWARD. I WOULD JUST ASK

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.653
TREATING- THESE COSTS AS

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.788
ONGOING. THE LEGISLATURE WILL

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.323
BE ABLE TO MAKE COMPENSATING

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:31.226
COMPENSATING BUDGET CHOICES

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:32.594

INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THESE

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:38.700
ONGOING PROGRAMS COST THANK YOU.

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:39.267
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NIGHT I

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:42.404
THINK. FROM THE HEARING WE HAD

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:43.705
LAST WEEK ALSO AND WE TALKED

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:47.075
ABOUT- SUSPENSION AND THEN TO

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:50.779
THIS WEEK. IN THE CONVERSATION

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:52.214
THAT WE'VE HAD ABOUT A LACK OF

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.882
CERTAINTY AND THE INABILITY TO

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:56.151
PLAN AND THE NEED TO RAISE

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:58.019
RATES SO WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH

01:20:58.086 --> 01:20:58.954
PROVIDERS TO DO THE VERY

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.022
IMPORTANT WORK I THINK THAT WE

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.857
ALL AGREE WOULD NEED TO BE NONE

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:04.125
THAT A BUDGET MUST BE MADE

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.728
WITH- SOME LEVEL OF CERTAINTY

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:09.831
AN- EXISTING IN REALITY. SO I

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:11.066
THINK UP SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:12.267
SAYING IS THOSE TWO THINGS

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.468
DON'T ALWAYS THEY'RE NOT LINED

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.537
UP IN SOME OF THE PROPOSALS

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.939
THAT WE SEE AND I WOULDA I

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:20.108
THINK I WOULD SPEAK FOR- ACROSS

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:22.210
THE AISLE WHEN WE SAY. THAT WE

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:24.546
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BUDGET THAT

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:25.480
PEOPLE CAN COUNT ON THE

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.015
CERTAINTY THAT IS BASED IN

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:28.950
REALITY OF WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:30.518
GONNA CUT AND NOT CUT DOWN AND

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.187
WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PLAN FOR

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:34.322
THE FUTURE- SO I WOULD I WOULD

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:35.624
SAY I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:38.727
LOOK FORWARD TO REVISITING HOW

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:40.695
WE DO THIS. A DIFFERENT. I

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:42.230
THANK YOU AND I THINK I'VE

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.465
RAISED THIS ISSUE MULTIPLE

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:44.899
TIMES BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:46.568
THIS IS PRIMARILY TOLD THE USE

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:47.569
AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:50.071
AND STALE POINT OUT SO- AND BY

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:51.473
THE WAY THIS IS NOT A GOOD TOOL

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:52.807
SO I'M NOT SUGGESTING WE USE

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:55.210
IT. ANYWHERE ELSE- BUT WHAT

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.878
WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE BUILT IN

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:58.847
CUTS. THAT WE WILL EACH YEAR

01:21:58.913 --> 01:22:00.148
DECIDE WHETHER WE WILL NOT

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:03.885
EXECUTE. FOR JUST HEALTH AND

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.020
HUMAN SERVICES SIGNIFICANT CUTS.

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:07.856
AND SO WE TALK A BUDGETS IS

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:09.858
BEING PRIORITIES- WE DON'T DO

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.626
THAT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:14.562
BUDGET. WE JUST WE MAINLY DO

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:15.263
THIS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:17.565
SERVICES AND I THINK IT

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:19.634
FORTUNATELY IT SENDS I THINK.

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:22.370
TO BE A WRONG MESSAGE ABOUT HOW

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:26.308
MUCH WE VALUE- SOME OF THE MOST

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:27.842
VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN THE STATE

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:30.745
OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE DO THIS

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:32.047
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:33.648
THINK SORT OF HAPPENED AFTER

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.116
THE LAST GREAT RECESSION AND

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:38.086
THOSE KIND OF A TOOL TO ITS ERA

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:40.488
BUT AND IT DOES DISTORT THE WAY

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:41.956
WE LOOK AT OUT YEARS TO AND I

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:43.425
THINK YOU KNOW WE TRY TO DO YOU

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:45.360
KNOW WE OUGHT WE TO DO A

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:46.361
RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING WE'VE PUT

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:49.764
IN MANY MEASURES ACTUALLY- TO

01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:55.003
ENSURE THAT- WE HAVE- FUNDS TO.

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.937
TO HELP US THROUGH THE BAD

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:58.206
TIMES- IN FACT ACTUALLY MADE

01:22:58.273 --> 01:22:59.374
THE ACTIONS WE JUST TOOK TO

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:01.142
HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND TO

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:03.211
HELP INDIVIDUALS AND SO FORTH.

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.612
OR BECAUSE OF A PRUDENT

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:07.716
BUDGETING. THAT WE'VE DONE- BUT

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:09.284
BY BUILDING IN THE SUSPENSIONS

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:12.153
AND THEN. SORT OF. PROJECTING

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.788
THAT WE WERE A QUOTE ACTUALLY

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:16.991
GONNA MAKE THESE CUTS- OUT INTO

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:19.127
IT OUT YEARS NO MATTER WHAT THE

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:20.895
ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. AND

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.497
THEN SAYING THAT WILL EACH YEAR

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:23.865
WILL REEVALUATE YES OF COURSE

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:25.734
WE VALUE IN EVERY PART OF THE

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.036
BUDGET EACH YEAR BUT THE BILL

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:30.338
THEN AUTOMATIC CUTS. INTO THE

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:32.073
AND THEN COOKED SUSPEND THEM

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.842
ONE YEAR AT A TIME I THINK IS-

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:35.210
IN INTO POTENTIALLY JUST LIKE

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:35.977
YOU DON'T HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.379
SERVICES AGAIN I DON'T THINK

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:38.847
THAT WE SHOULD DO IT ACROSS THE

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:39.314
BUDGET THAT'S NOT ONE

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:40.982
SUGGESTING BY ANY MEANS. I

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:43.651
THINK IS AN APPROPRIATE AND- WE

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:44.786
REALLY SHOULD HAVE. A

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.055

BILLION AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.559
WAS ESPECIALLY INSTRUMENTAL IN

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:05.493
SECURING THOSE NEEDED

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.262
INVESTMENTS. AND WE WERE

WINFIELD THE IMPLEMENTATION IS

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:19.540
SLOW I'M SPECIALLY SLOW DURING

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.208
THIS INITIAL PHASE IN PERIOD.

01:36:21.275 --> 01:36:23.244
OF THE THIRTY THREE HUNDRED

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:24.912

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.680
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS FOUR

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:27.314
HUNDRED NINETY NINE PEOPLE HAVE

SERVICE PROGRAM INTO THE SELF

01:36:32.786 --> 01:36:34.622
DETERMINATION PROGRAM SO AFTER

01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:38.659
ALMOST. THREE YEARS THAT'S

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:39.627
ABOUT 20% THE QUESTION IS ON MY

01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:41.228
AS WELL THIS RATE IS A SIGN OF

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:41.996
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:44.565
PROGRAM FOR IS IT JUST THE PACE

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.167
OF IMPLEMENTATION. I'VE LOOKED

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:47.301
AT IT FROM MANY ANGLES AND MY

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:48.903
CONCLUSION IS THAT THE SLOW

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:49.770
PACE IS A MATTER OF

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:51.472
IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE GOOD

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:52.840
NEWS IS THERE'S MANY PLACES AND

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:54.875
WAYS TO IMPROVE ON

01:36:54.942 --> 01:36:56.443
IMPLEMENTATION AT FIRST I

01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:57.745
WANTED KNOWLEDGE THE DELAYS

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.580
CAUSED BY CORPORATE. DIRECTOR

PEOPLE WITH IBD EVERYONE

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.557
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. BOB

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:11.158
ENSURING GREAT LEADERSHIP TO

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:12.593
JUST IT BEING HENCE THIS

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.662
PROGRAM DESPITE BE INCREDIBLE

01:37:14.728 --> 01:37:18.065
BARRIERS THE PENAMPANG TO MAKE

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:20.601
POST. BIANCO GOOD. IN AUGUST OF

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:21.068
TWENTY TWENTY WINFIELD

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:22.503
MENTIONED STATEWIDE SELF

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:23.604
DETERMINATION ADVISORY

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:24.905
COMMITTEE PRODUCER BERIA'S

01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:26.240
RECORDS. ON THE SELF

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:27.274
DETERMINATION PROGRAM

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:30.010
IDENTIFIED FOUR MAIN BARRIERS

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:31.445
I'M GONNA SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE-

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:33.280
BARRIERS AND WE'VE PROVIDED

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:34.882
THAT REPORTS IN ITS

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:35.382
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THIS

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:37.418
COMMITTEE. I ALSO THINK THAT

01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:39.086
THE DDS DATA THAT'S IN THE

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:40.754
AGENDA IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:42.923
IT HELPS US. LOOK AT WHERE OUR

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.458
BREAKDOWNS MAY BE HAPPENING AND

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:45.926
COME UP WITH TARGETED REMEDIES

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:48.128
NOW WE CAN SEE WHO WAS

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:49.697
COMPLETED EACH STEP OF THE

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.498
PROCESS AND WE CAN SEE IF I

01:37:51.565 --> 01:37:53.300
REGIONAL CENTER- THE DATA SHOWS

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:54.802
THERE'S A DROP OFF BETWEEN

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:57.438
STEPS ONE AND STEPS TO. 85% OF

01:37:57.504 --> 01:37:59.073
PEOPLE COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP

01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:00.774
BUT ONLY TWENTY EIGHT HAVE

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:03.077
FINISHED THE SECOND STEP- SO WE

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.211
CAN LOOK AT AND THINK WHAT'S

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:05.346
HAPPENING THERE IN THE PROCESS

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:07.314
INCOME OF THE TARGET REMEDIES.

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:09.450
FOR EACH STEP OF THE PROCESS SO

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:11.819
SOME SOLUTIONS INCLUDE- SETTING

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:13.187
BENCHMARKS FOR THE DIFFERENT

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:14.154
DATA POINTS THAT ARE THE

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:15.155
DEPARTMENTS TRACKING AND

01:38:15.222 --> 01:38:17.791
REPORTING ON- AS I MENTIONED IS

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.693
A GOOD ENOUGH THAT 85% OF

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.495
PEOPLE FINISH THE FIRST STEP-

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.197
IS IT BAD THAT ONLY TWENTY. 8%

01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:24.565
OF FINISH THE SECOND STEP AT

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:26.200
THIS POINT THE PROCESS OR IS IT

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:28.135
JUST A NATURAL PART IN FLOW

01:38:28.202 --> 01:38:29.970
THIS PROCESS. A BENCH MARKS

01:38:30.037 --> 01:38:30.938
WILL SET UP REASONABLE

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:33.107
EXPECTATIONS. FOR EVERYBODY

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:35.409
INVOLVED YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:36.010
GONNA TAKE TO GET ACROSS THE

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:37.945
FINISH LINE. ALSO BETTER

01:38:38.012 --> 01:38:39.413
SOLUTIONS EACH REGIONAL CENTER

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.682
SHOULD SET A GOAL FOR HOW MANY

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:42.549
PEOPLE CAN ENROLL IN THE NEXT

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.151
SIX MONTHS. I JUST SAID IT'S

01:38:44.218 --> 01:38:49.456
PRACTICAL. AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:50.090
ANOTHER RECOMMENDED IS THERE'S

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:51.225
BE A KEY. TO ENROLL FOR. WHO

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:52.226
ARE MY OF LOCAL SELF

MOTIVATED. AND THEY SHOULD.

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:03.937
THEY SHOULD BE ON. LASSETER'S

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:04.571
ONE BURIED IT DOESN'T SHOW UP

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.206
IN THE DATA OF THE PHASE IN

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:07.808
PERIOD ITSELF HAS CREATED ITS

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.910

THIS PERIOD ENDS ON JUNE TWENTY

01:39:21.955 --> 01:39:24.358

STATEWIDE BAN WITHOUT CHANGE ON

01:39:26.393 --> 01:39:27.895
THAT WITH THE SYSTEM AND SHIFT

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:29.697

PARTICULAR ITEM SO- AND REALLY

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:49.416
IT'S THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:51.919

NOTED STATUTES ARE REQUIRED A

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:03.964
THREE YEAR- PHASE INFURIATED.

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:05.566
AFTER THE TIME THAT THE

DEPARTMENT RECEIVED APPROVAL

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.970
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR

ENDS- THIS SUMMER. AND IT'S

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:20.514
UNCLEAR AND AT THAT POINT

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:22.483
STATUTES SAYS THAT THE PROGRAM

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:24.184

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:47.674
IS- PRIMARILY FISCAL SO STATUTE

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:48.809
REQUIRES THAT THE SELF

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:51.178
DETERMINATION PROGRAM- BE

01:40:51.245 --> 01:40:53.947
BUDGET NEUTRAL. AND THE WAY

01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:55.349
THAT IT'S WORKING IS THAT THE

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:58.051
INDIVIDUAL BUDGET FOR EACH-

01:40:58.118 --> 01:40:59.520
CONSUMER IS BASED ON THE

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:01.522
PREVIOUS YEAR'S SPENDING ON

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:03.724
THAT CONSUMER AT LEAST TWO

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:05.259
CONSIDERATIONS ARE CAN BE

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:07.494
ALLOWED HOWEVER SO FOR ONE IF

01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:08.829
SOMEBODY IS NEW TO THE SYSTEM

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:10.330
AND DIDN'T HAVE SPENDING IN THE

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:12.666
PREVIOUS YEAR OBVIOUSLY- A NEW

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:14.435
BUT IT HAS TO BE DEVELOPED.

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:18.005
SECONDLY IF AN INDIVIDUAL HAD-

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:20.507
SOME AMOUNT OF UNMET NEED IN

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:22.075
THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT CAN BE

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:24.478
ACCOUNTED FOR AND WHAT WE'VE

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:26.847
BEEN HEARING FROM SOME REGIONAL

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:27.948
CENTERS AS WELL AS FROM THE

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.950
DEPARTMENT ITSELF IS THAT

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:32.986
CONCERT COMING IN HIGHER- FOR

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.588
INDIVIDUALS THAN IN PREVIOUS

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:36.356
YEARS. AND THIS COULD REALLY

01:41:36.423 --> 01:41:39.359
MEAN A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST-

01:41:39.426 --> 01:41:40.928
IT COULD MEAN THAT CONSUMERS

01:41:40.994 --> 01:41:42.229
WERE NOT GETTING EVERYTHING

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:43.730
THAT THEY NEEDED IN PREVIOUS

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:44.965
YEARS AND THIS IS SORT OF

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:47.067
MAKING UP FOR THAT IN THE SELF

01:41:47.134 --> 01:41:48.802
DETERMINATION PROGRAM. COULD

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:50.771
ALSO MEAN THAT SERVICES THAT

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:52.372
ARE PROVIDED OUTSIDE OF THE

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:55.008

OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL DDS

01:41:56.743 --> 01:41:59.346
SERVICE PROVIDER NETWORK- COULD

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:01.849
YOU COULD COST MORE. AND THAT

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:03.650
IN TURN COULD BE A REFLECTION

01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:05.586
OF THE RATE CHALLENGES- THAT

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:09.423
WE'VE ALREADY. HEARD DISCUSSED

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.225

TO THAT- IT IS AFTER YOU'VE HAD

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:23.763
YOUR ORIENTATION DO YOU STILL

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:24.664
WANT TO GO ON AND CONTINUE IN

01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:27.167
THE PROGRAM. 85% SAID YES TO

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:28.034
SPEAKING DIRECTLYTO YOUR

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:30.670
QUESTION ABOUT DEMAND AND ALSO-

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:32.339
DECREE WITH DRUG DEPARTMENT'S

01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:34.140
COMMENT THAT. WITH 20% OF THE

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:35.942
PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROGRAM IT'S

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:37.010
NOT QUITE A REPRESENTATIVE

01:48:37.077 --> 01:48:38.411
SAMPLE AS TO WHAT THE

01:48:38.478 --> 01:48:40.747
EXPENDITURES WILL BE WHETHER.

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:41.381
WHETHER NOT THE L. A. O.

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:44.951
CONCERNS. WITH CAN BE SUPPORTED

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:46.853
BY INFORMATION. I THINK. THAT

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:51.625
CAN. THANKS VERY MUCH. THIS IS

01:48:51.691 --> 01:48:54.127
THE LOOKING THROUGH. SOME OF

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:55.595
THE INFORMATION PRESENTED TOOK

01:48:55.662 --> 01:48:59.299
THE FIRST OF ALL- IF SOMEONE IS

01:48:59.366 --> 01:48:59.733
GOING THROUGH SELF

01:48:59.799 --> 01:49:03.203
DETERMINATION- AT WHAT POINT IT

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:05.672
ARE SIMPLE OF THE FORTY FORTY

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:06.306
SEVEN PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:08.008
A PLANET HAVE EXPENDTURE IF

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:09.442
THEY DECIDED THIS ISN'T WORKING

01:49:09.509 --> 01:49:11.778
FOR THEM CAN THEY GET BACK OUT

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:19.552
AGAIN. YES FROM REGIONAL CENTER

01:49:19.619 --> 01:49:21.388
CONSUMERS CAN OPT OUT OF SELF

01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:22.389
DETERMINATION IF THEY WANT TO

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:24.357
GO BACK TO TRADITIONAL SIX AT

01:49:24.424 --> 01:49:26.893
ANYTIME. ANYTIME OKAY ALL RIGHT

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.695
OKAY THAT THAT'S HELPFUL TO

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:29.529
KNOW AND THEN THE OTHER

01:49:29.596 --> 01:49:31.264
QUESTION IS THAT IT IS THAT THE

01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:32.732
AMOUNT OF THE BUDGET THE AMOUNT

01:49:32.799 --> 01:49:34.801
OF MONEY TO BUDGET. IT IS THAT

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:37.637
IS BASED ON- THE PREVIOUS I

01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:38.939
GUESS THE PREVIOUS YEAR BEFORE

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:40.173
YOU DECIDE TO ENTER INTO SELF

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:44.844
DETERMINATION. IS A- NOW- WELL

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:46.646
CERTAINLY SOME DEVELOPMENTAL

01:49:46.713 --> 01:49:47.380
DISABILITIES MAY BE FAIRLY

01:49:47.447 --> 01:49:49.449
STABLE OVER TIME CERTAINLY

01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:50.583
CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE AND

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:51.918
SOMETIMES SOME OF THE DEVELOP

01:49:51.985 --> 01:49:52.719
DISABILITIES MAY NOT BE SO

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:54.087
STABLE DEPENDING ON THE NATURE

01:49:54.154 --> 01:49:56.022
OF THE DISABILITY IS. ARE THERE

01:49:56.089 --> 01:49:58.091
JUST THEIR INTENTION THAT THEIR

01:49:58.158 --> 01:50:00.560
ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE FOR

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:02.629
THOSE THINGS OVER TIME OR I

01:50:02.696 --> 01:50:03.797
KNOW THIS IS WE'RE STILL KIND

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.865
OF NEW OURS OURS AFFECTS BUDGET

01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:07.067
FOR I MEAN HOW FIX IS THIS

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:09.436
BUDGET OVER TIME. AND HOW DOES

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:13.740
IT TAKE ACCOUNT OF CHANGING.

01:50:13.807 --> 01:50:14.207
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THAT

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:15.041
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. YEAH SO

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:17.210
THIS DETERMINE PRO. IS SIMILAR

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.778
TO TRADITIONAL. MANAGEMENT AND

01:50:18.845 --> 01:50:21.481
THAT- THE PLANNING TEAM COMES

01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:24.317
UP WITH A PLAN. DENNIS THAT

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:26.219
PLANNED AT THE TOWN BUDGET IS

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:29.823
DETERMINED AND INDEED- IS

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:32.625
DERIVED FROM THE BUDGET. SO THE

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:34.627
MONEY TEAM LOOKS AT PRIOR

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:36.096
TWELVE MONTHS OF EXPENDITURES

01:50:36.162 --> 01:50:37.230
AND THEN THEY CONSIDER ANY

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:38.798
UNMET NEEDS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:50:38.865 --> 01:50:41.034
MIGHT HAVE. AND THEN THAT HELPS

01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:42.669
TO DETERMINE WHAT IS IN THE I.

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:44.938
P. AND ASK THE BUDGET AND SPIN

01:50:45.005 --> 01:50:47.040
OKAY SO I WAS IN THE SELF

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.475
DETERMINATION PLANNED AHEAD OF

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:51.177
BUDGET FOR ONE YEAR. AND THEN

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:52.779
THEY MADE CERTAIN CHOICES.

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:55.348
PLANNING TEAM WILL LOOK AT THAT

01:50:55.415 --> 01:50:56.516
AND THEN DECIDE NEXT YEAR'S

01:50:56.583 --> 01:51:01.588
BUDGET ARDELL. LOOK AT A

01:51:01.654 --> 01:51:04.124
HYPOTHETICAL SET OF- THAT THAT

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:05.191
FOR. OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:05.959
SELF DETERMINATION PER THAT ARE

01:51:06.026 --> 01:51:07.861
DID NOT DECIDE TO PURCHASE. IT

01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:09.362
SO I'M JUST WONDERING LIKE HOW.

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:11.031
WHAT DOES THE TEAM LOOK AT IF

01:51:11.097 --> 01:51:11.831
SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY IN THE SELF

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:15.268
DETERMINATION- PROGRAM- ARE

01:51:15.335 --> 01:51:16.202
THEY ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WHAT

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.771
THEY ACTUALLY CHOSE TO SPEND

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:19.239
UNDER BUDGET ARE THEY LOOKING

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:20.974
AT A HYPOTHETICAL PLANNED FOR

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:23.276
SOMEONE OF THIS AND SIMILAR

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:25.512
CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S BASED ON

01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:27.347
THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR NEEDS

01:51:27.414 --> 01:51:29.015
AND THOSE NEEDS CAN BE

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:31.251
REVISITED AND ANYTIME. OKAY OUT

01:51:31.317 --> 01:51:32.052
SENT OUT OF THE PLANNING TEAM

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:34.054
COULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:37.357
BUDGET BASED ON. THAT'S CORRECT

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:41.161
OKAY ALL RIGHT- AND THEN- I

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:42.095
GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS

01:51:42.162 --> 01:51:45.432
THAT- SO I GUESS. IS IT- WILL

01:51:45.498 --> 01:51:47.133
COMING SOON WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.503
BRANCH THIS OUT TO EVERYONE.

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:52.505
BUT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:51:52.572 --> 01:51:54.140
COMMENTS MADE THAT IT SEEMS TO

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:56.009
BE POPULAR BECAUSE 85% PEOPLE

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.310
OF TO GET ORIENTED SHOWS TOO

01:51:57.377 --> 01:51:58.678
BUT SAME TIME- IT MAKE NOTE

01:51:58.745 --> 01:52:00.547
THAT WE- WE HAVEN'T HIT THE

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:02.449
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. RIGHT LET

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:03.750
ME WITH A TWENTY FIVE WE'VE HAD

01:52:03.817 --> 01:52:06.219
SPACES WE'VE HAD THREE THOUSAND

01:52:06.286 --> 01:52:07.353
THREE HUNDRED. TWENTY SIX

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:10.523
PEOPLE SELECTED BUT THEN A

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:12.392
HUNDRED SEVEN. YEAH ELEVEN

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:13.426
SEVENTY TWO THE TRUE SO WORD

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:15.161
THAT CONTINUE PARTICIPATION

01:52:15.228 --> 01:52:17.230
ONLY TWENTY ONE FIFTY FOUR. OF

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.698
WHICH ONLY FOUR TO FORTY SEVEN

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:20.300
ARE CONTINUING SELF. NOT SAYING

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:21.334
THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT THIS

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.470
BUT- IS THERE A THOUGHT THAT

01:52:23.536 --> 01:52:25.105
PERHAPS WERE I MEAN WE HAVEN'T

01:52:25.171 --> 01:52:26.239
REALLY UNVEILED A PHILIP THE

01:52:26.306 --> 01:52:29.476
PILOT IN SOME WAYS THAT INITIAL

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:30.610
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SO. IS THE

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:33.146
PLAN TO STILL THE CONTINUE THE

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:36.116
PILOT TO GET MORE DATA OR TO I

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:37.650
MEAN WE'RE AT THAT WE'RE GOING

01:52:37.717 --> 01:52:38.618
WE'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST A

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:39.719
POINT WHERE SINGLE NOW WHAT'S

01:52:39.786 --> 01:52:41.187
GOING TO OPEN UP TO EVERYONE

01:52:41.254 --> 01:52:42.122
BUT DO WE REALLY KNOW ENOUGH

01:52:42.188 --> 01:52:44.090
ABOUT THIS. SINCE WE CAN'T EVEN

01:52:44.157 --> 01:52:46.459
GET THE PILOT TO BE COMPLETELY.

01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:52.665
FILLED. AND DOCTOR CANADA.

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:54.567
NANCY BIRDS MENDES. YEAH THERE

01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:56.369
IS A COUPLE THINGS I'D LIKE TO

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:58.972
MAKE NOTE OF IT IS THAT WE ARE-

01:52:59.038 --> 01:53:01.241
EVALUATING- WHAT ARE KIND OF

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:03.009
PLANNED FOR ROLLOUT LIKE. LIKE

01:53:03.076 --> 01:53:06.379
I HAD HAD HAD SAID THAT WE FIND

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:07.113
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.682
FOR US TO. HAVE A PRETTY

01:53:09.749 --> 01:53:12.218
COMPREHENSIVE- KIND OF PLANET

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:14.154
APPROACH TO NEXT STEPS TO

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.955
ADDRESS- THE BARRIERS THAT HAVE

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:17.757
BEEN DISCUSSED BUT THEN ALSO

01:53:17.824 --> 01:53:21.628
TO. IDENTIFY YOU KNOW HOW TO

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:23.229
WHAT THE DIGITAL GUARDRAILS IF

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:25.698
ANY ARE NEEDED- SOME EXAMPLES

01:53:25.765 --> 01:53:27.567
OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOU KNOW

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:28.935
HOW ARE WE APPROACHING THERE'S%

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:30.670
THAT I USE. AND SELF

01:53:30.737 --> 01:53:32.338
DETERMINATION THE ONLY VENDOR

01:53:32.405 --> 01:53:33.239
TO SERVICE IN SELF

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.175
DETERMINATION IS THE FINANCIAL

01:53:35.241 --> 01:53:38.678
MANAGEMENT SERVICE- AND AS WE

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:40.947
LOOK AT- SOME OF THE BARRIERS

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:42.715
SOME OF IT IS CENTERED AROUND.

01:53:42.782 --> 01:53:44.784
AND HOW WE'VE APPROACHED OUR

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:47.387
OUR OUR STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.956
MANAGEMENT SERVICES SO. WE NEED

01:53:50.023 --> 01:53:51.491
TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE

01:53:51.558 --> 01:53:52.292
GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THAT

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:55.395
FORWARD- SO TO YOUR POINT AS

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:58.298
FAR AS- ARE WE GOING TO USE

01:53:58.364 --> 01:54:00.266
MORE INFORMATION TO HELP INFORM

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:01.734
US AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT.

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:02.602
YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO IT YOU

01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:05.138
KNOW AS NOTED WE HAD. MORE THAN

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:07.106
DOUBLED- THE NUMBER OF

01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:08.608
PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE MOVED

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:11.344
PAST ORIENTATION. PASSED HAVING

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:12.545
THEIR BUDGET THAT TOO THERE'S

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:14.314
MANY PLANT. WE HAVE MORE

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:15.882
INDIVIDUALS OF THAT MILESTONE

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:18.184
AT THE LATER STAGES THAT WE DID

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:20.753
EARLIER ON- I WILL SHARE WITH

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:26.326
YOU THAT NATIONALLY- THERE'S-

01:54:26.392 --> 01:54:27.694
MOST STATE WHO HOW ASSAULTED.

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.729
PROGRAM AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE

01:54:29.796 --> 01:54:32.899
ABOUT THAT- AVERAGE ABOUT

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:35.768
10215% OF THOSE. WHO ARE WITHIN

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:37.870
THEIR WAIVERS ACTUALLY OPTED TO

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:39.572
PARTICIPATE IN A SELF

01:54:39.639 --> 01:54:42.242
DETERMINATION PROGRAM- AND I'M

01:54:42.308 --> 01:54:43.476
NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S A CAP

01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:45.078
THAT WE WOULD WANT TO ACHIEVE

01:54:45.144 --> 01:54:47.513
TO- BUT I THINK IT GIVES US A

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.882
LITTLE BIT OF VISIBILITY INTO.

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:51.517
WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE

01:54:51.584 --> 01:54:53.653
EXPERIENCED- WHEN THEY'VE HAD

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:56.889
THE BROADER- DOOR OPEN FOR A

01:54:56.956 --> 01:54:58.758
MORE PARTICIPANTS BEYOND WHAT

01:54:58.825 --> 01:55:00.393
WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN OUR FIRST

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:02.295
THREE YEARS OF THE PILOT OF OR

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:03.162
NOT I SHOULDN'T USE THE TERM

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:06.165
PILOT. OF THE FADED OF THE

01:55:06.232 --> 01:55:08.167
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED VERSES-

01:55:08.234 --> 01:55:11.070
HAVING IT OPEN TO OUR BROADER

01:55:11.137 --> 01:55:13.106
COMMUNITY. OKAY SO I GUESS WHAT

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:15.441
I'M NOT HEARING IS- THE ANSWER

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:16.743
TO THE QUESTION WHICH IS THAT

01:55:16.809 --> 01:55:18.544
DO YOU PLAN TO CAN T. D. IT

01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:20.079
WELL I GUESS YOU'LL TELL. OF

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:29.856
PLAN TO CONTINUE TO PILE WHICH

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:31.157
BY THE WAY STILL HAS SLOTS SO

NOW THAT THEY'RE STILL A LOT OF.

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:28.634

TERMS OF HOW TO MOVING THIS

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:47.553
PROGRAM FORWARD AND BE SURE

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.188

CERTAINLY NOT OPPOSED TO DOING

01:58:53.125 --> 01:58:54.494
SELF DETERMINATION I THINK THAT

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:57.163
THE ISSUE IS THAT- SOUNDS LIKE

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:58.164
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE

01:58:58.231 --> 01:58:59.565
GUARDRAILS YET GIVEN THE

01:58:59.632 --> 01:59:01.067
LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:02.568
WE HAVE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:03.870
STILL. DON'T HAVE THAT MANY

01:59:03.936 --> 01:59:05.805

UP OKAY- FOR THAT AND SO I

01:59:13.479 --> 01:59:14.113
THINK WE WANT TO BE SURE WE

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.883
HAVE THOSE. ENOUGH DATA TO SO

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:18.117
THAT WE HAVE THOSE LESSONS

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:20.319

THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED-

02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:46.472
WHAT I'M SEEING FROM MY POINT

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:47.573
OF VIEW IS THAT EVERY PART OF

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:49.542

LEADERSHIP IS WORKING ON AN

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:04.890
EVIDENCE OF THAT IS HOW MANY

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:06.292
MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ROLLED

COMMUNITY IN THE LEGISLATURE AS

02:07:58.137 --> 02:08:01.874
THEY NOTED- DOES- PROPOSED THE

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:03.809
TWENTY ONE DIFFERENCE- FRC'S-

02:08:03.876 --> 02:08:05.477
WE WOULD DO THIS THROUGH A

02:08:05.544 --> 02:08:06.612
REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WE WOULD

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:10.015
WORK- THROUGH- THAT THE

02:08:10.082 --> 02:08:12.518
COMMUNITY TO PROPOSE THAT AND

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:13.485
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS

02:08:13.552 --> 02:08:15.354
PROPOSED. YES WHAT IS THE

02:08:15.421 --> 02:08:16.688
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAMILY

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:18.357
RESOURCE CENTER AND KIND OF A

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:19.992
COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR HOW IS IT

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:22.528
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT- AS A

02:08:22.594 --> 02:08:24.329
PROBABLY NOTED AND THE AGENDA

02:08:24.396 --> 02:08:25.931
AT THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:28.167
ARE REALLY ENGAGED IN EARLY

02:08:28.233 --> 02:08:29.668
START WELL SOME OF THEM MAY

02:08:29.735 --> 02:08:31.003
HAVE CONTRACTS WITH REGIONAL

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:32.037
CENTERS TO DO SOME OTHER

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:33.605
EFFORTS THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS

02:08:33.672 --> 02:08:35.908
REALLY HAS BEEN. ON CONNECTING

02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:38.844
TO THE COMMUNITIES- IN AN EARLY

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:40.979
START AND HELP BEING KIND OF-

02:08:41.046 --> 02:08:43.382
PARENT EDUCATION- THIS REALLY

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:46.085
BROADENS THAT SO WHAT WE WOULD

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:48.187
BE ASKING IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:08:48.253 --> 02:08:49.421
ONE OF THOSE DIFFERENCE WHERE

02:08:49.488 --> 02:08:50.823
FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS CAN

02:08:50.889 --> 02:08:53.459
EXPAND. THEIR EFFORTS AND WOULD

02:08:53.525 --> 02:08:58.363
BE ABLE. TO HIRE ONE OR MORE-

02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:59.131
NAVIGATE THAT ARE TRUSTED THE

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:00.232
CAN. SO IT WOULD BE DRIVEN

02:09:00.299 --> 02:09:02.568
BASED ON EITHER A FAMILY MEMBER

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:04.837
OR SOMEBODY THAT IS- SEPARATE

02:09:04.903 --> 02:09:07.372
FROM A REGIONAL CENTER- TO BE

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:10.109
ABLE TO HELP FAMILIES- CONNECT

02:09:10.175 --> 02:09:11.143
AND UNDERSTAND REGIONAL CENTER

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:13.045
SERVICES. ALSO GENERIC

02:09:13.112 --> 02:09:14.980
RESOURCES AND OF BUILDING THAT

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:17.816
BRIDGE BUT ALSO BUILDING B.

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:20.152
INDIVIDUALS AND THE FAMILIES-

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:21.987
SKILL SETS TO BE ABLE TO AT-

02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:25.290
ADVOCATE AND NAVIGATE- EVEN

02:09:25.357 --> 02:09:27.459
BEYOND THE WORK THAT- THAT

02:09:27.526 --> 02:09:29.094
COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS WOULD BE

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:32.931
ABLE TO DO WITH THEM- WE WOULD-

02:09:32.998 --> 02:09:35.534
BUILD N A- MEASURE THAT WOULD

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:37.970
BE PRE AND POST. SO WE WOULD BE

02:09:38.036 --> 02:09:39.171
ABLE TO HAVE A STANDARDIZED

02:09:39.238 --> 02:09:41.006
MEASURE ACROSS THE STATE YOU'VE

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:42.841
HEARD ON A COUPLE OF THE OTHER

02:09:42.908 --> 02:09:44.610
PANEL SOME OF THE CHALLENGES-

02:09:44.676 --> 02:09:46.078
OF SOME INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE

02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:48.747
HAD GOING FORWARD- THAT THE

02:09:48.814 --> 02:09:50.149
CONSISTENCY BETWEEN RACIAL

02:09:50.215 --> 02:09:51.984
CENTERS AND SO AGAIN THIS IS

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:53.685
REALLY ABOUT. THE DEPARTMENT

02:09:53.752 --> 02:09:55.921
THEN ISSUING AT PROVIDING KIND

02:09:55.988 --> 02:09:56.955
OF THE STRUCTURE AROUND IT SO

02:09:57.022 --> 02:09:59.358
WE WOULD HAVE CONSISTENCY IN

02:09:59.424 --> 02:10:01.126
THE GOALS AND THE TRAINING AND

02:10:01.193 --> 02:10:02.227
EXPECTATIONS THAT WOULD BE

02:10:02.294 --> 02:10:04.229
ACROSS. EACH OF THOSE AND THEN

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:05.764
THE SAME FOR THE MEASURES THAT

02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:09.168
WE WOULD. BE PUTTING FORWARD-

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:10.402
AND WE CAME UP WITH THE

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:13.272
PROPOSED AMOUNT- WE LOOK TO SEE

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:14.740
HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO HAVE

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:17.276
A COUPLE OF POSITIONS- THAT

02:10:17.342 --> 02:10:19.244
WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK WITHIN

02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:21.146
THE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:22.781
AS WELL ASTHE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:25.384
SUPPORTS THAT WOULD GO IN. AND

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:27.519
SO ON AN AVERAGE IS ABOUT- ON A

02:10:27.586 --> 02:10:29.021
ON GOING BASIS IT WOULD BE

02:10:29.087 --> 02:10:31.390
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:32.524
THOUSAND PER. AND REGIONAL

02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:34.059

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:35.527
STAKEHOLDER INPUT WE ARE GOING

02:10:35.594 --> 02:10:37.396
TO- EVLUATE HOW IT WOULD BE

02:10:37.462 --> 02:10:39.031
DISTRIBUTED- THROUGHOUT

02:10:39.097 --> 02:10:41.533
CALIFORNIA WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:43.402
SMALLERREGIONAL CENTERS HAVE.

02:10:43.468 --> 02:10:46.905
ALMOST IS AS MANY CHALLENGES AS

02:10:46.972 --> 02:10:47.406
LARGER REGIONAL CENTER

02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:49.675

DON'T WANT TO MEASURE IT BASED

02:10:59.084 --> 02:11:00.686
ON THAT WE WANT TO MEASURE TO

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:02.754
BASED ON BASED ON HOW WE CAN

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:06.792

AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO LEARN

02:16:16.968 --> 02:16:19.704

THINGS ARE EASIER CAL. HOWEVER

02:16:30.482 --> 02:16:31.816

YOUR ACCESS HAS BEEN IMPROVED-

02:16:47.232 --> 02:16:49.034
PURCHASE OF SERVICE IS AN

02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:51.636
IMPORTANT METRIC- AND IT'S ONE

02:16:51.703 --> 02:16:53.638
THAT WE- CONTINUED OUR TO

02:16:53.705 --> 02:16:55.106
REQUIRE REGIONAL CENTERS TO

02:16:55.173 --> 02:16:57.375

02:16:57.442 --> 02:16:59.444
OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THAT

02:16:59.511 --> 02:17:01.680
THE AGE THE PLACE OF RESIDENCE

02:17:01.746 --> 02:17:03.248
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND

02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:04.916
SERVICES THE DISTANCE THAT

02:17:04.983 --> 02:17:06.484
PEOPLE. EITHER NEED TO BE

02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:09.254
TRANSPORTED- OR THAT THE

02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:11.256
SERVICE PROVIDER MUST COVER TO

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:13.325
GET TO. I AM PEOPLE'S

02:17:13.391 --> 02:17:14.626
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CONDITIONS

02:17:14.693 --> 02:17:16.761
ALSO AFFECT OF PURCHASE OF

02:17:16.828 --> 02:17:18.663
SERVICE SPENDING. WELL OF

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:19.898
COURSE WILL CONTINUE AT A

02:17:19.965 --> 02:17:21.333
POPULATION LEVEL TO COMPARE

02:17:21.399 --> 02:17:23.902
THOSE THINGS- WERE ALSO TRYING

02:17:23.969 --> 02:17:25.637
TO DIVE DEEPER INTO OUR DATA TO

02:17:25.704 --> 02:17:27.272
LOOK AT SIMILARLY SITUATED

02:17:27.339 --> 02:17:30.342
INDIVIDUALS. TO DRAW MORE FINER

02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:32.911
COMPARISON- LIGHTLY LIKE IF YOU

02:17:32.978 --> 02:17:36.247
WILL. BUT WE'VE ALSO LEARNED

02:17:36.314 --> 02:17:38.917
AND IT PROBABLY IS OBVIOUS YOUR

02:17:38.984 --> 02:17:40.318
IF WE HAVE A POT OF ELEVEN

02:17:40.385 --> 02:17:42.220
MILLION DOLLARS AND WE FIVE

02:17:42.287 --> 02:17:43.622
HUNDRED PROJECTS WITH IT.

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:45.023
THAT'S NOT A GREAT DEAL OF

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:47.125
MONEY IT'S ROUGHLY A HUNDRED

02:17:47.192 --> 02:17:48.493
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PROJECT

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:50.061
AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT WITH

02:17:50.128 --> 02:17:51.429
THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:52.998
INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE

02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:54.666
CONCENTRATED AND IMPACTFUL

02:17:54.733 --> 02:17:56.368
RESULTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE

02:17:56.434 --> 02:17:58.970
SYSTEM. THIS IS ALSO

02:17:59.037 --> 02:18:00.705
EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:02.107
BECAUSE OF THE ANNUAL FUNDING

02:18:02.173 --> 02:18:03.375
CYCLE A NUMBER OF THESE

02:18:03.441 --> 02:18:06.111
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN TIME LIMITED

02:18:06.177 --> 02:18:07.145
TO EITHER TWELVE OR TWENTY FOUR

02:18:07.212 --> 02:18:10.148
MONTHS- SO YOU'RE RAMPING UP

02:18:10.215 --> 02:18:11.983
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO RAMP

02:18:12.050 --> 02:18:13.752
DOWN TO REPORT ON IT TO MEASURE

02:18:13.818 --> 02:18:16.254
THE IMPACT. AND THAT IN A LOAN

02:18:16.321 --> 02:18:17.489
RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

02:18:17.555 --> 02:18:20.525
STATE'S SUSTAINABILITY OF THE

02:18:20.592 --> 02:18:20.992
IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT

02:18:21.059 --> 02:18:22.761
SUMMERTIME. SO WITH THESE

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:24.462
CONCERNS IN MIND IN TWENTY

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:26.398
TWENTY. STATEWIDE EQUITY

02:18:26.464 --> 02:18:28.566
MEASURES WERE IMPLEMENTED TO

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:29.334
ALLOW ALL OF US TO TRACK

02:18:29.401 --> 02:18:33.672
PROGRESS IN IN A BETTER WAY. WE

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:36.875
SO FAR ANALYZE CHANGES FROM

02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:38.276
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE YEAR BEFORE

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:40.645
THE EQUITY GRANTS THROUGH

02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:44.182
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR-

02:18:44.249 --> 02:18:45.884
OF THE TWENTY ONE POPULATION

02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:48.086
LEVEL EQUITY MEASURES EIGHT OF

02:18:48.153 --> 02:18:49.654
THEM IMPROVED BY THREE POINTS

02:18:49.721 --> 02:18:52.323
OR MORE. TEN CHAU DOLLAR MINOR

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:54.225
CHANGE AND THREE ACTUALLY

02:18:54.292 --> 02:18:57.929
SHOWED US IT WAS A LARGE CAP-

02:18:57.996 --> 02:18:59.931
NOTABLY TO WE WERE CONCERNED TO

02:18:59.998 --> 02:19:00.765
SEE THAT THERE WAS NO

02:19:00.832 --> 02:19:02.367
IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE SIX

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:03.568
MEASURES THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:06.204
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HISPANIC OR

02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:08.273
SPEAK SPANISH. ALSO WE'RE

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:10.375
CONTINUING TO IDENTIFY THINGS

02:19:10.442 --> 02:19:11.242
THAT THAT CONCERN US A GREAT

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:13.244
DEAL WE'RE CONTINUING TO

02:19:13.311 --> 02:19:15.113
ANALYZE MORE RECENT DISPARITY

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:18.950
DATA FROM BOTH OF US THAT AT

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:19.584
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SCHOOL

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:22.220
YEAR IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES

02:19:22.287 --> 02:19:25.790
FISCAL YEAR- THERE IS ROOM FOR

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:27.392
A LITTLE BIT OF OPTIMISM ONE

02:19:27.459 --> 02:19:28.993
PRELIMINARY FINDING THAT I'LL

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.462
SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT AMONG

02:19:30.528 --> 02:19:33.231

FOR ASIANS COMPARED TO WHITES

02:19:39.003 --> 02:19:40.472
IMPROVED IN SIX REGIONAL

02:19:40.538 --> 02:19:44.175
CENTERS. WELL THE PER CAPITA

02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:45.677

IMPROVED IN TEN OF THEM- SO WE

02:19:49.547 --> 02:19:51.015
DO THINK WE'RE MANAGING TO MOVE

02:19:51.082 --> 02:19:52.350
THE NEEDLE A LITTLE BIT LOOKING

02:19:52.417 --> 02:19:55.854

BASIS THROUGH A WHAT WE CALL

OUR COMMUNITY IN THINKING ABOUT

02:26:52.770 --> 02:26:54.939
S. THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR THAT

02:26:55.006 --> 02:26:56.607
I AM TESTIFYING ABOUT THE SAME

02:26:56.674 --> 02:26:57.875
URGENT PROBLEMS AND DISPARITIES

VOICE OF OUR COMMUNITY. I WAS

02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:08.252
ASKED TO ADDRESS WHETHER DDS

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:09.854
FUNDED PROJECTS TO ADDRESS

02:27:09.921 --> 02:27:11.322
DISPARITIES HAVE BEEN MAKING

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:13.224
THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. BASED

02:27:13.291 --> 02:27:16.561
ON THE DATA. IT CLEAR IT IS

02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:17.094
CLEAR THAT THINGS ARE NOT

02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:19.063
GETTING BETTER. AFTER FIVE

02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.798
YEARS OF DISPARITY GRANTS

02:27:20.865 --> 02:27:22.833
LATINOS ASIANS AND AFRICAN

02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:25.102
AMERICANS ARE STILL RECEIVING

02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:27.538
FEWER SERVICES THAN WHITES AND

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:28.472
THE DISPARITIES CONTINUE TO

02:27:28.539 --> 02:27:30.508
WORSEN. DISABILITY VOICES

02:27:30.575 --> 02:27:32.543
UNITED ANALYZE THE MOST RECENT

02:27:32.610 --> 02:27:34.378
DATA AND WE FOUND THAT PROFOUND

02:27:34.445 --> 02:27:37.148
DISPARITIES STILL EXIST IN ALL

02:27:37.215 --> 02:27:38.249
TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS

02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:40.551
PARTICULARLY WITH WHAT THE

02:27:40.618 --> 02:27:43.654
LATINOS. FOR EXAMPLE. AFTER THE

02:27:43.721 --> 02:27:44.488
FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO

02:27:44.555 --> 02:27:47.959
SPEND ON GROUNDS. INCLUDING

02:27:48.025 --> 02:27:49.026
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. DIRECTLY TO

02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:51.062
REGIONAL CENTRES THERE WAS ONLY

02:27:51.128 --> 02:27:52.496
THREE REGIONAL CENTERS OUT OF

02:27:52.563 --> 02:27:54.198
THE TWENTY ONE. THAT PROVIDED

02:27:54.265 --> 02:27:56.734
THE LATINOS HALF OF WHAT THE

02:27:56.801 --> 02:27:58.970
WHITES RECEIVED ONLY HALF. AN

02:27:59.036 --> 02:28:00.571
ALL THE OTHERS PROVIDED LESS IN

02:28:00.638 --> 02:28:02.773
THAT HOUSE. NOW WE HEAR THAT

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.909
THE REASON IS PROBABLY BECAUSE

02:28:04.976 --> 02:28:05.509
THE LATINO COMMUNITY TEACH OUR

02:28:05.576 --> 02:28:07.612
CHILDREN. AT HOME INTO

02:28:07.678 --> 02:28:09.914
ADULTHOOD. BUT EVEN WHEN YOU

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:12.650
COMPARE THE LATINO ADULTS WHO

02:28:12.717 --> 02:28:13.718
WHY DID THOSE THAT ARE LIVING

02:28:13.784 --> 02:28:17.054
AT HOME THE DISPARITIES REMAIN.

02:28:17.121 --> 02:28:18.889
AND WHILE ASIANS AND AFRICANS

02:28:18.956 --> 02:28:20.491
AMERICANS DON'T FACE THE SAME

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:22.226
LEVEL OF DISPARITIES THEY ARE

02:28:22.293 --> 02:28:23.628
STILL FACING SIGNIFICANT

02:28:23.694 --> 02:28:25.129
INEQUITIES ARE THE MEASURE ANY

02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:28.899
MEASURE. MANY PEOPLE OF COLOR

02:28:28.966 --> 02:28:29.433
CONTINUE TO REPORT FEELING

02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:31.702
INTIMIDATED. AN OVERWHELMED BY

02:28:31.769 --> 02:28:34.238
THE SYSTEM AND ARE SOMETIMES

02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:36.274
THE WE'RE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP IN

02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:38.643
FEAR RETALIATION WE NEED TO SEE

02:28:38.709 --> 02:28:40.911
MORE OF A CULTURAL CHANGE AT

02:28:40.978 --> 02:28:43.214
THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL. WE

02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:45.650
SEE MORE OF A CULTURAL.

02:28:45.716 --> 02:28:49.587
HUMILITY TO BE IMPLEMENTED. WE

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:51.389
DO NOT DENY THAT THE REAL BY A

02:28:51.455 --> 02:28:53.157
SUCCESS WE NEED TO STOP

02:28:53.224 --> 02:28:54.825
ATTRIBUTING DISPARITIES TO THE

02:28:54.892 --> 02:28:57.028
ETHNIC CULTURES OF FAMILIES OR

02:28:57.094 --> 02:28:59.697
THEIR LACK OF EDUCATION OR

02:28:59.764 --> 02:29:00.631
KNOWLEDGE OF THE OF THE ENGLISH

02:29:00.698 --> 02:29:02.733
LANGUAGE WE MOVED WE NEED TO

02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:04.468
MOVE INTO A CULTURE OF HUMILITY

02:29:04.535 --> 02:29:06.070
EMPATHY OF THE ACCEPTANCE AND

02:29:06.137 --> 02:29:09.073
SUPPORT. REGIONAL CENTERS NEED

02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:10.775
TO MAKE A CONCENTRATED EFFORT

02:29:10.841 --> 02:29:13.377
TO MEET FAMILIES WHERE THEY'RE

02:29:13.444 --> 02:29:14.979
AT AT EVERY LEVEL. I WAS ALSO

02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:16.681
ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE TWO NEW

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:18.416
PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR THE

02:29:18.482 --> 02:29:19.884
FIRST IS TO FIND A ONE TIME

02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:21.719
INDEPENDENT. EVALUATION ON THE

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:23.754
DISPARITY PROJECTS. THIS IS AN

02:29:23.821 --> 02:29:25.389
ACTION THAT DISABILITY VOICES

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:27.458
UNITED HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:29.226
WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THIS

02:29:29.293 --> 02:29:31.696
REQUEST AND WE SUPPORTED. IT IS

02:29:31.762 --> 02:29:34.465
CRITICAL THAT THE EVALUATION BE

02:29:34.532 --> 02:29:34.899
FROM THE COMMUNITIES

02:29:34.965 --> 02:29:36.967
PERSPECTIVES. ABOUT THE

02:29:37.034 --> 02:29:38.703
EVALUATORS MUST HAVE DIRECT

02:29:38.769 --> 02:29:40.571
INDEPENDENT ACCESS TO THE

02:29:40.638 --> 02:29:42.440
FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:29:42.506 --> 02:29:44.208
PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROJECTS.

02:29:44.275 --> 02:29:45.409
MANY OF THE PROJECTS ARE NOT

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:47.311
RUN BY CBO'S BUT BY THE

02:29:47.378 --> 02:29:48.713
REGIONAL CENTERS AND

02:29:48.779 --> 02:29:49.547
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT LED

02:29:49.613 --> 02:29:53.417
BY PARENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT

02:29:53.484 --> 02:29:53.984
THAT THESE GET EVALUATED AS

02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:56.253
WELL. THE PROPOSAL WAS TO SPEND

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:57.488
THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

02:29:57.555 --> 02:29:59.890
ON THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR

02:29:59.957 --> 02:30:00.458
PROGRAM BASED IN THE FAMILY

02:30:00.524 --> 02:30:02.460
RESOURCE CENTER. WHERE WE SEE

02:30:02.526 --> 02:30:04.028
THE VALUE OF FAMILY RESOURCE

02:30:04.095 --> 02:30:05.262
CENTRES WITHOUT A DOUBT AND WE

02:30:05.329 --> 02:30:07.164
BELIEVE THAT MORE PEER TO PEER

02:30:07.231 --> 02:30:08.933
SUPPORT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WE

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.935
ARE CONCERNED THAT THE

02:30:11.001 --> 02:30:11.535
ENGAGEMENT WITH FAMILIES WILL

02:30:11.602 --> 02:30:13.738
BE LIMITED. BECAUSE TRUE

02:30:13.804 --> 02:30:15.439
COMMUNITY OUT REACH HAS TO BE

02:30:15.506 --> 02:30:17.842
NEUTRAL AND UNBIASED MANY SEE

02:30:17.908 --> 02:30:19.810
THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS AS

02:30:19.877 --> 02:30:20.644
AN EXTENSION OF REGIONAL

02:30:20.711 --> 02:30:23.147
CENTERS THE PROMOTER AND THE

02:30:23.214 --> 02:30:24.682
NAVIGATOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:26.617
REPRESENT THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE

02:30:26.684 --> 02:30:27.952
WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS

02:30:28.018 --> 02:30:28.753
REACHING OUT INTO THE

02:30:28.819 --> 02:30:31.122
COMMUNITY. AND THAT LOYALTY IS

02:30:31.188 --> 02:30:32.256
OFTEN PERCEIVED TO BE THE

02:30:32.323 --> 02:30:34.158
SYSTEM THAT THEY REPRESENT. A

02:30:34.225 --> 02:30:35.693
PROGRAM LIKE THE INTAKE OF O.

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:38.496
AS IN OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO

02:30:38.562 --> 02:30:41.699
OUT REACH INTO FROM THE COMMUTE

02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:43.768
BACK INTO THE REGIONAL CENTER.

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:44.602
IT IS FROM FAMILIES

02:30:44.668 --> 02:30:48.005
PERSPECTIVES FROM OUR ISSUES

02:30:48.072 --> 02:30:49.140
ARE CHALLENGES IN OUR NEEDS. WE

02:30:49.206 --> 02:30:51.142
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER

02:30:51.208 --> 02:30:52.843
FOR THE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM TO

02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.712
SUCCEED TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL.

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:56.814
IT WILL REQUIRE COLLABORATION

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:58.716
TO INCLUDE CPOS. WHO ALREADY

02:30:58.783 --> 02:30:59.683
HAVE AN ESTABLISHED

02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:01.519
RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST OF

02:31:01.585 --> 02:31:03.554
RESPECT AND VALIDATION WITH

02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:06.157
FAMILIES. DESPITE THE LACK OF

02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:07.825
PROGRESS WE ARE HEADING IN THE

02:31:07.892 --> 02:31:10.961
RIGHT DIRECTION. IN IT COULD

02:38:06.476 --> 02:38:07.845
WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD

02:38:07.911 --> 02:38:09.546
WHETHER THERE'S INTERACTION

02:38:09.613 --> 02:38:11.315
WITH OUR FAMILIES WE'RE SEEING

02:38:11.381 --> 02:38:13.083
THAT THAT THIS IS NOT A

02:38:13.150 --> 02:38:14.484
PRACTICE THAT THERE ARE A LOT

02:38:14.551 --> 02:38:17.120
OF TIMES. FAMILIES THEY FEEL

02:38:17.187 --> 02:38:19.656
ARE ARE DOWN TO THEY THEY STILL

02:38:19.723 --> 02:38:22.125
MADE A FAIRER- AND IT'S ALREADY

02:38:22.192 --> 02:38:24.061
A REALLY COMPLICATED SYSTEM TO

02:38:24.127 --> 02:38:27.064
NAVIGATE THROUGH. AND WHEN A

02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:31.735
PARENT DOES. FEEL EMPOWERED AND

02:38:31.802 --> 02:38:32.402
GETS TO A POINT WHERE THERE ARE.

02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:35.339
ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS THEN

02:38:35.405 --> 02:38:36.940
A LOT OF TIMES THEY FEEL THAT

02:38:37.007 --> 02:38:38.976
STRONG PUSHBACK IN IN IN ITS

02:38:39.042 --> 02:38:40.444
PERCEIVED AS IN DATA

02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:43.580
INTIMIDATION. IN MANY CASES-

02:38:43.647 --> 02:38:45.883
THAT PUSHBACK IS AUTOMATICALLY

02:38:45.949 --> 02:38:47.718
SENT THROUGH TO WHAT THEY CALL

02:38:47.784 --> 02:38:49.620
IT A FAIR HEARING WHICH- WOULD

02:38:49.686 --> 02:38:51.355
PROBABLY THIS THERE'S NOTHING

02:38:51.421 --> 02:38:53.790
FAIR ABOUT A FAIR HEARING WHEN

02:38:53.857 --> 02:38:55.592
IT COMES TO OUR COMMUNITY. OKAY

02:38:55.659 --> 02:38:57.227
ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THE

02:38:57.294 --> 02:38:59.529
FOLLOW UP ON THAT- YOU KNOW I

02:38:59.596 --> 02:39:02.833
IF IT THINK- APPRECIATE THIS-

02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:06.103
PROPOSAL- THAT'S FOR US AND

02:39:06.169 --> 02:39:06.703
WHAT WE LEARNED FROM SOME THE

02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:08.672
PREVIOUS PROJECTS- BUT I THINK

02:39:08.739 --> 02:39:10.574
I KNOW THAT- ADDRESS BAR

02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:11.742
TONIGHT'S HATS MANY

02:39:11.808 --> 02:39:13.176
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS ISSUE

02:39:13.243 --> 02:39:14.711
BECAUSE THIS ISSUE SPEND LONG

02:39:14.778 --> 02:39:17.047
STANDING UP BEFORE I EVEN WAS

02:39:17.114 --> 02:39:18.248
ON THE SUB COMMITTEE WE WERE

02:39:18.315 --> 02:39:19.983
DEALING WITH THAT AND WE'VE

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:24.488
BEEN DEALING. FOR MANY YEARS- I

02:39:24.554 --> 02:39:25.122
GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT WELL ONE OF

02:39:25.188 --> 02:39:26.356
THE- AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE

02:39:26.423 --> 02:39:27.624
HAVE GRANTS WE HAVE PROGRAMS I

02:39:27.691 --> 02:39:28.659
THINK ONE THINGS WE'VE TALKED

02:39:28.725 --> 02:39:31.728
ABOUT BEFORE- IS ABOUT ALSO

02:39:31.795 --> 02:39:33.697
CHANGING THE CULTURE WITHIN.

02:39:33.764 --> 02:39:36.366
THE THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND SO

02:39:36.433 --> 02:39:40.037
FORTH- AS WELL SO IT'S MORE- TO

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:42.472
TRY TO MAKE IT MORE WELCOMING

02:39:42.539 --> 02:39:44.675
FOR PEOPLE- FOR AGAIN- FAMILIES

02:39:44.741 --> 02:39:46.310
OF COLOR AND AGAIN THE

02:39:46.376 --> 02:39:47.511
DISPARITY STILL PERSIST I

02:39:47.577 --> 02:39:48.812
APPRECIATE I HEAR APPROVED

02:39:48.879 --> 02:39:50.781
MEANT I HAVEN'T HEARD MAGNITUDE

02:39:50.847 --> 02:39:52.716
SO- SO I'VE HEARD WHAT I'VE

02:39:52.783 --> 02:39:53.817
HEARD SOME TESTIMONY SAYING

02:39:53.884 --> 02:39:55.018
THAT THINGS HAVE. GONE THE

02:39:55.085 --> 02:39:55.919
RIGHT DIRECTION THAT'S ALWAYS

02:39:55.986 --> 02:39:57.254
GOOD BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD

02:39:57.321 --> 02:39:59.990
MAGNITUDE OF THE MOVE LIKE SO.

02:40:00.057 --> 02:40:01.124
AND WE'RE HEARING TESTIMONY

02:40:01.191 --> 02:40:02.659
FROM DISBELIEF VOICES UNITED

02:40:02.726 --> 02:40:04.294
THAT ACTUALLY THE MOVEMENT

02:40:04.361 --> 02:40:06.930
ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT- SO IN

02:40:06.997 --> 02:40:08.598
ADDITION TO PROGRAMS ARE UNDER

02:40:08.665 --> 02:40:09.800
STANDARDS ARE BEING PUT IN

02:40:09.866 --> 02:40:10.801
PLACE FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:40:10.867 --> 02:40:11.868
LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY PASSED A

02:40:11.935 --> 02:40:14.771
LAW SAYING THAT- BOARDS-

02:40:14.838 --> 02:40:16.573
CORPORATE BOARDS SHOULD HAVE.

02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:18.108
AT LEAST SOME REPRESENTATION

02:40:18.175 --> 02:40:21.011
OF- YOU KNOW OF THIS VENTURE

02:40:21.078 --> 02:40:22.412
YEAH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT

02:40:22.479 --> 02:40:24.381
COMMUNITIES UNDER CORPORATE

02:40:24.448 --> 02:40:26.283
BOARDS. YOU THINK THAT REGIONAL

02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:27.951
CENTER SHOULD TO DO EVEN MORE

02:40:28.018 --> 02:40:29.319
THAN A CORPORATE BOARD SHOULD.

02:40:29.386 --> 02:40:31.922
SO ARE THEIR STANDARDS FOR-

02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:34.091
DIVERSITY ON THE BOARDS OF THE

02:40:34.157 --> 02:40:35.392
REGIONAL CENTERS AND ALSO

02:40:35.459 --> 02:40:37.894
STAFF- TO THAT THAT THE

02:40:37.961 --> 02:40:40.364
DEPARTMENT HAS SET OR- OR THAT-

02:40:40.430 --> 02:40:45.068
IT THAT'S BEING SET. TO ENSURE

02:40:45.135 --> 02:40:45.769
THAT WE HAVE- IT MORE.

02:40:45.836 --> 02:40:47.270
BASICALLY SURE WE A- VOICES IN

02:40:47.337 --> 02:40:49.072
THE GOVERNANCE OF- THESE VERY

02:40:49.139 --> 02:40:51.742
IMPORTANT THAT INSTITUTIONS.

THERE IS AND HAS BEEN- GOSH I

02:40:56.813 --> 02:40:58.281
CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME WHEN IT

02:40:58.348 --> 02:41:02.319
WAS- BROUGHT INTO TWO LOTS BEEN

02:41:02.386 --> 02:41:05.088
MANY MANY MANY YEARS- THAT THAT

02:41:05.155 --> 02:41:06.523
THE BOARDS OF THE REGIONAL

02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:07.824
CENTERS HAVE TO REPRESENT THEIR

02:41:07.891 --> 02:41:10.660
COMMUNITY- SO THAT DIVERSITY

02:41:10.727 --> 02:41:13.030
AND WE TRACK AS A DEPARTMENT WE

02:41:13.096 --> 02:41:15.132
TRACKED THAT BY- AND YOUR

02:41:15.198 --> 02:41:17.334
REVIEW- AND REQUIRE REGIONAL

02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:18.835
CENTERS IF THEY ARE NOT IN

02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:21.605
COMPLIANCE- BUT WITH- THE

02:41:21.671 --> 02:41:23.507
DIVERSITY OF THEIR COMMUNITY.

02:41:23.573 --> 02:41:25.609
AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN ON

02:41:25.675 --> 02:41:29.379
HOW TO ACHIEVE- TO ACHIEVE THAT.

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:31.515
IN ADDITION- RECENTLY SOME OF

02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:33.216
THE OTHER- AREAS IN WHICH WE

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:34.451
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:41:34.518 --> 02:41:35.485
BOARD WAS INFORMED OF THESE

02:41:35.552 --> 02:41:38.021
ISSUES IS THAT IF IT WASN'T

02:41:38.088 --> 02:41:40.290
LAST YEAR IS THAT PRIOR YEAR-

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:41.825
WE HAD PROPOSED AND THERE IS

02:41:41.892 --> 02:41:44.428
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE- THAT WAS

02:41:44.494 --> 02:41:47.064
WAS ADDED. ON TO REQUIRE

02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:49.900
REGIONAL CENTERS TO- PRESENT TO

02:41:49.966 --> 02:41:52.069
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THEIR-

02:41:52.135 --> 02:41:54.571
DISPARITY KIND OF- THAT THE

02:41:54.638 --> 02:41:56.673
INFORMATION AND- THEIR

02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:58.241
PROPOSALS AND THEIR PLANS

02:41:58.308 --> 02:41:59.309
BEFORE SUBMITTING TO THE

02:41:59.376 --> 02:42:01.378
DEPARTMENT. IS WE REALLY WANT

02:42:01.445 --> 02:42:02.379
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOARDS

02:42:02.446 --> 02:42:04.448
ALSO HAD AN INCREASED

02:42:04.514 --> 02:42:07.651
AWARENESS. OF THE- THE

02:42:07.717 --> 02:42:10.620
INFORMATION THAT THE COMMUNITY

02:42:10.687 --> 02:42:12.422
IS SHARING- WITH THE REGIONAL

02:42:12.489 --> 02:42:14.524
CENTER AS WELL AS THEIR DATA

02:42:14.591 --> 02:42:17.994
RELATED TO PURCHASE OF SERVICE-

02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:21.531
WE ALSO IN ADDITION BECAUSE-

02:42:21.598 --> 02:42:23.967
BEING. A MISTER GOMEZ AND

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:26.369
OTHERS HAVE SHARED- THE CONCERN

02:42:26.436 --> 02:42:30.340
ABOUT THE- ACCESS OR THE-

02:42:30.407 --> 02:42:34.511
FAIRNESS BE KIND OF APPROACH TO

02:42:34.578 --> 02:42:36.680
FAIR HEARINGS AND THAT IS THE-

02:42:36.746 --> 02:42:38.048
DUE PROCESS THAT THE REGIONAL

02:42:38.115 --> 02:42:40.250
CENTER SYSTEM HAS AND THIS IS

02:42:40.317 --> 02:42:41.451
ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT I DO

02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:42.752
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

02:42:42.819 --> 02:42:44.754
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR- SERVICE

02:42:44.821 --> 02:42:46.890
ACCESS AND EQUITY WORKGROUP AND

02:42:46.957 --> 02:42:49.226
EVALUATE. YOU KNOW IS THERE-

02:42:49.292 --> 02:42:52.362
ALTERNATIVES- THAT WE COULD-

02:42:52.429 --> 02:42:55.132
HAVE AVAILABLE TO- PROVIDE A

02:42:55.198 --> 02:42:58.335
REVIEW- UNDER DUE PROCESS AND-

02:42:58.401 --> 02:42:59.336
BECAUSE THOSE ARE CERTAINLY

02:42:59.402 --> 02:43:01.605
ISSUES THE CULTURE- WE

02:43:01.671 --> 02:43:05.075
PRIORITIZED- DISPARITY- GRANTS

02:43:05.142 --> 02:43:06.710
WE WANTED TO HAVE CULTURAL

02:43:06.776 --> 02:43:09.946
SENSITIVITY AND- TRAINING-

02:43:10.013 --> 02:43:11.381
WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND

02:43:11.448 --> 02:43:13.216
SERVICE PROVIDERS- THIS IS AN

02:43:13.283 --> 02:43:14.417
AREA THAT I THINK WE CAN DO

02:43:14.484 --> 02:43:17.420
MORE- WE'VE WE HAVE BEEN TAKING

02:43:17.487 --> 02:43:18.522
A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE

02:43:18.588 --> 02:43:20.624
DIFFERENCE- CAN I TRAININGS

02:43:20.690 --> 02:43:22.626
THAT HAVE. REALLY POSITIVE KIND

02:43:22.692 --> 02:43:24.027
OF OUTCOMES AND IMPACT WHETHER

02:43:24.094 --> 02:43:25.562
IT'S IMPLICIT BIAS OR CULTURAL

02:43:25.629 --> 02:43:28.265
SENSITIVITY- SO THAT IS

02:43:28.331 --> 02:43:29.733
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

02:43:29.799 --> 02:43:37.407
EXPLORING- THERE WAS. ALSO.

02:43:37.474 --> 02:43:39.609
THAT THE STANDARD INFORMATION

02:43:39.676 --> 02:43:42.045
PACKETS- THAT WE INTRODUCED-

02:43:42.112 --> 02:43:43.213
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:45.215
FAMILIES HAVE SHARED- EVEN

02:43:45.282 --> 02:43:46.483
ENTERING INTO THE REGIONAL

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:47.551
CENTER SYSTEM IS THAT THEY

02:43:47.617 --> 02:43:49.219
DIDN'T HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE

02:43:49.286 --> 02:43:51.054
SAME INFORMATION WHICH AN

02:43:51.121 --> 02:43:52.923
INCREASE DISPARITIES- SO WE

02:43:52.989 --> 02:43:54.658
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE-

02:43:54.724 --> 02:43:55.892
WERE INTRODUCED IN THAT WE'RE

02:43:55.959 --> 02:43:57.794
IN THE FINAL STAGES OF HAVING-

02:43:57.861 --> 02:44:00.397
THAT. AVAILABLE AS WELL- AND I

02:44:00.463 --> 02:44:01.798
HAD ONE FINAL THOUGHT AND I

02:44:01.865 --> 02:44:04.234
APOLOGIZE THAT IT'S LESLIE SAID

02:44:04.301 --> 02:44:06.002
IT TAKEN NOTE- MAYBE SOMETHING

02:44:06.069 --> 02:44:07.804
TRIGGER AND I'LL CIRCLE BACK

02:44:07.871 --> 02:44:10.674
WITH THE COMMITTEE ON IT. OKAY

02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:16.379
SHE US- I US SEEM LIKE A- AGAIN-

02:44:16.446 --> 02:44:18.782
MAY THE STAFF ARE REALLY- IT I

02:44:18.848 --> 02:44:19.749
THINK THAT- YOU WE'VE WE'VE

02:44:19.816 --> 02:44:21.451
TOUCHED ON THESE BEFORE WHEN WE

02:44:21.518 --> 02:44:22.619
HAD AND OUR CONVERSATIONS I

02:44:22.686 --> 02:44:24.654
THINK. GOT THIS POINT TWO OR

02:44:24.721 --> 02:44:26.556
THREE YEARS AGO. ANDTALKED

02:44:26.623 --> 02:44:27.857
ABOUT THE NEED FOR A CULTURAL

02:44:27.924 --> 02:44:29.359
CHANGE- WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE

02:44:29.426 --> 02:44:31.328
SOME SORT OF- AB AND APPRECIATE

02:44:31.394 --> 02:44:32.963
YOUR PRESENTATION TO HAVE SOME

02:44:33.029 --> 02:44:34.698
REPORT ON SOME UNKNOWN WHERE WE

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:36.933
ARE WITH THE AMPLE ARE. ALL

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.902
OUR- REGIONAL CENTERS THAT THEY

02:44:38.969 --> 02:44:40.370
HAD TO DIVERSITY PARK IT'S WHAT

02:44:40.437 --> 02:44:44.407
ARE TODAY IT'S ADDRESS SO- AND

02:44:44.474 --> 02:44:45.675
ALSO IN TERMS OF OUR STAFFING

02:44:45.742 --> 02:44:47.744
AS WELL. SO I DO APPRECIATE THE

02:44:47.811 --> 02:44:49.479
PROGRESS DEPARTMENT IS MAKING

02:44:49.546 --> 02:44:50.480
AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS

02:44:50.547 --> 02:44:52.215

WORK TO DO AND I THINK AND

02:44:59.289 --> 02:44:59.723
CERTAINLY DON'T WANTTO

02:44:59.789 --> 02:45:01.958
UNDERMINE THE- PROJECTS ARE

02:45:02.025 --> 02:45:03.360
BEING PROPOSED BUT I THINK WAS

02:45:03.426 --> 02:45:04.961
WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.

02:45:05.028 --> 02:45:06.796
PROJECTS ARE GREAT BUT- YOU

02:45:06.863 --> 02:45:07.464
KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:08.832
CULTURE ITSELF OF THE

02:45:08.898 --> 02:45:10.367
INSTITUTION OTHERWISE- YOU
