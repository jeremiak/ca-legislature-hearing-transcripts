00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:44.615
ASSISTANCE WITH THAT'S NOT I

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:45.850
DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO THE FACT

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:46.818
THAT WE'VE HAD ALL THESE

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:49.554
WILDFIRES AND THOUSANDS OF HOMES

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:49.921
HAVE BEEN LOST.

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:52.457
BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS

00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:54.225
THAT -- WE

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:56.894
NEED TO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:59.096
ASPECT OF THE DISCUSSION AS WELL

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:00.498
AS HARDENING THE GRADE IN THESE

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:01.933
OTHER THINGS SO.

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:03.234
IT TURNS OUT THE STATE FIRE

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:05.269
MARSHAL INC A MAINTAINED TO LIST

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.704
OF UPGRADES THAT HOMEOWNERS AND

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.173
HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS SHOULD

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.975
UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THEIR HOMES

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.543
MORE RESILIENT TO WILDFIRES.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.445
INCLUDING AS I MENTIONED GETTING

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:15.580
RID OF WHO WOULD --

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:17.114
OR ROUTE A SHINGLE ROOFS AND

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.416
WOOD SIGHTINGS.

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:19.584
BUT OF COURSE THE COST OF THESE

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.252
CAN BE.

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:22.787
QUITE PROHIBITIVE I KNOW WHEN WE

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:25.189
REPLACED OUR SHINGLED ROOF IT

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:27.558
WAS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:29.160
UP BUT IT'S NECESSARY YOUR

00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:30.461
INVESTMENT HOLE FOR MANY PEOPLE

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:31.762
YOUR HOME IS YOUR PRIMARY

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:32.730
INVESTMENT.

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.899
AND BECAUSE OF A THE YEAH

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:36.634
INCIDENTS OF FIRES AND THEIR

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:38.636
IMPACTS OF THIS IS THE KIND OF

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:40.872
THING WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING OUR

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:42.406
ATTENTION ON ITS HOMEOWNERS WE

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:43.908
ARE EMPOWERED THERE ARE THINGS

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:44.876
WE CAN DO.

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:46.544
AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM SO I

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:47.879
WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW HOMEOWNERS

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:49.780
AND BUSINESSES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:51.382
OF THIS PROGRAM.

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:53.117
A TO FINANCE SOME OF THESE ARE

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:54.952
HOME HARDENING UPGRADES RIGHT

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:57.154
NOW PAYS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR

00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:58.189
ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:00.391
PROJECTS AND SEISMIC UPGRADES

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:00.992
AND I WILL TELL YOU THOSE ARE

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:02.727
ALL IMPORTANT NO QUESTION ABOUT

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:03.327
IT.

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:04.428
BUT AS WE LOOK AT THE

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:07.565
DEVASTATION OF THE SHOULD BE

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:10.401
ADDING THIS KIND OF CRITERIA --

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:12.970
TO THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.839
PAYS FOR ANYTHING AND SO.

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.574
WITH THAT I KNOW AS I MENTIONED

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:17.942
THAT THE CHAIR IS WORKING ON

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.545
REFORMING PACE I HAVE NO.

00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:22.213
QUARREL WITH THAT I THINK THAT

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.748
THAT WORK IS IMPORTANT AND I

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:25.349
KNOW HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:26.651
LOTS OF DISCUSSION.

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:28.686
BUT AGAIN WALL PACE IS THERE

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:30.221
LET'S ADD THIS VERY IMPORTANT

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:34.058
CRITERIA TO HELP EMPOWER PEOPLE

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:34.892
TO TECH THEIR HOMES ARE IN THESE

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:36.227
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:37.762
CIRCUMSTANCES SO.

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:39.430
SPECIFICALLY THIS MEASURE

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:40.765
INCORPORATES ITS OWN CONSUMER

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:42.233

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:51.642
SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:53.210
FINANCED UNDER THE BILL.

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:54.612

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:00.551
SEVERITY SONGS TARGETING THIS

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:01.886
FUNDING FOR THAT WHERE IT'S

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:03.054
GOING TO DO THE BEST.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.523
A BEST AND AND HIGHEST USE

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.491
LIMITING THE TYPES OF PROJECTS

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:09.060

SHOULD BE DOING ALL THOSE THINGS.

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:53.004
BUT WHEN THE HOMES THEMSELVES

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.305
ARE THE FUEL.

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.107
WE WILL NEVER SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:22.399
SOME POINT SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:23.634

GIVING HAVING MORE TOOLS IN THE

SO THAT'S WHY I A DECIDED THAT

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.406
EXPANDING PAYS TO ALLOW FOR

00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:03.507

UNDERWRITING.

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:10.714
A WHICH IS WHY I'VE MADE THE

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:13.884
