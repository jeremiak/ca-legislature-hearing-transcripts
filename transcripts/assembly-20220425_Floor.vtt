00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:23.433
THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AS A

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.136
GENOCIDE. BEFORE AN OCCURRENCE

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:28.538
THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF THREE

00:53:28.605 --> 00:53:30.574
MILLION VICTIMS. INCLUDING THE

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.876
SYRIANS GREEKS AND OTHER

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:35.245

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:37.847
OVER A HUNDRED YEARS TO GIVE

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:39.549
THIS TO WAIT. BUT EVEN THEN IT

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:40.717
COMES WITH THE DENIAL BY THE

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:43.787
PERPETRATORS THEMSELVES. AND WE

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.589
COULDN'T SEE THIS MORE CLEARLY

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.657
THAN WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:50.894
. WHEN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:56.566
OF ARMENIA AZERBAIJAN FUELED BY

00:53:56.633 --> 00:54:00.437

CONTINUE TO CARRY OUT YET

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.780
ANOTHER ATROCIOUS ATTACK WHILE

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:13.383
THE WORLD WAS IN THE SLUMBER OF

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.719
THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. AND WHEN

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.587
OUR COUNTRY HAD A PRESIDENT

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:20.056

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:23.093
A BLIND EYE. OF DURING THESE

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:27.597
ONGOING AND SO UNFORTUNATELY.

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.399
BECAUSE THE GENOCIDE ITSELF WAS

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:35.005
NOT. UNEQUIVOCALLY STATED AND

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:37.774

GOTTEN RID OF BEFORE AND THIS

00:54:56.126 --> 00:55:00.830
HAPPENED BEFORE ALL OF US. SO

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:02.766
EVEN WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY EVEN

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:06.269
WITH. THE AMPLE INFORMATION THAT

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:08.171
WE HAVE EVEN WITH THE CLICK OF A

00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:10.407
BUTTON HOW QUICKLY INFORMATION

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:15.278
GETS DISSEMINATED. IT'S HARD TO.

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:17.180
I THINK THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:19.616
COULD HAPPEN WHEN WE KNOW SO

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:22.986
MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT IT DID. IT

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:26.322
HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE US. AND

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:29.225
THAT IN ITSELF IS THE REASON WHY

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:31.728
WE NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:35.265
ALWAYS SPEAK OUT ALWAYS EDUCATE

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:39.069
AND ALWAYS TELL OUR CHILDREN.

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:40.570
WHAT DEBT AND THAT INCIDENT

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:42.939
MEANS BECAUSE OF THREE

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:46.609
GENERATIONS REMOVED. I'M STILL

00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:50.046
IMPACTED BY IT. I RAN FOR OFFICE

00:55:50.113 --> 00:55:52.749
AND GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS

00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:56.152
BECAUSE OF THE DEEP. DEEPLY HELD

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:58.555
SENSE OF INJUSTICE THAT'S

00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:01.324
OCCURRED I KNOW MANY OF US.
