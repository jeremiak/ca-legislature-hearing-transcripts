THE VICE CHAIRMAN CAME UP WITH RESPECT TO THE ADOPTION OF THE RULES SO HE'S HERE SO. WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. WELCOME MISTER ROSS. WE ARE NOW AT THE PART OF THE AGENDA TO ADOPT THE COMMITTEE RULES FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY LEGISLATIVE SESSION. COPY OF THE PROPOSED RULES WAS PROVIDED TO YOU BEFORE THE HEARING TODAY. THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEES RULES -- FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I HAVE SPOKEN TO MR VICE CHAIRMAN AND TO SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- WITH THAT I WILL NEED A MOTION BUT I BELIEVE MISTER ROTH YOU HAVE A COMMENT TO MAKE FIRST WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR. THAT THE AND THERE'S SOME. WHAT APPEARED CHANGES TO THE RULES AND THAT'S FINE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IN? ADOPTING THESE CHANGES. OF THAT THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THIS AND THAT IS THAT SHOULD A HONOR REQUEST COME FORWARD FROM A MEMBER [inaudible] THE CHAIR. DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER THESE CHANGES TO HOLD THAT REQUEST BUT INSTEAD MUST BRING THE REQUEST TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING. THAT'S CORRECT THE RULES ARE BASICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RULES FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SESSION. AS STATED IN JOINT ROLE MEETING NUMBER TWENTY THE CHAIR SHALL SET THE HEARING OF AUDIT REQUEST AND ARRANGE THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. NOTICE OF HEARING ABOUT A REQUEST WILL BE GIVEN TO THEIR QUESTOR AND SUCH OTHER APPROPRIATE PERSONS REQUIRING NOTICE. ON A REQUEST WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED IN THE ABSENCE OF THE REQUESTED WITHOUT HIS OR HER CONSENT HOWEVER I REQUEST MAY BE PRESENTED BY THE REQUEST IS REPRESENTATIVE AUTHORIZED IN WRITING. SO I BELIEVE THAT -- SETTLED THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU YES QUESTION YOUR QUESTION SIR. YES JUST FOR COMPLETE CLARITY SO. SO. THE UNDER THE RULES THAT WERE ADOPTING. CLOSING QUESTION OF THIS ON THE RULES WERE ADOPTING. ANY AUTO REQUEST THAT IS SUBMITTED THE CHAIR. SHALL SCHEDULE A NOTE AND THERE'S NO DISCRETION FOR THE CHAIR. TO THE CLIENT SCHEDULED CORRECT THAT. SO THE ISSUE OF SHALL IN MAY. WHICH IS ADOPTED IN THE SENATE RULES AND THE DOCTORS IN THE ASSEMBLY RULES WHERE THE CHAIR OF EACH COMMITTEES AS MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU HAVE THAT AUTHORITY UNDER THE JOINT RULES THE FIRST SENTENCE OF JOINT RULE TWENTY THE CHAIR SHALL IT'S A SHALL. SET THE HEARINGS OF ODD REQUESTS AND ARRANGE THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. SO THE CHAIR HAS TO SET YEAH. HEY GUYS GONNA FURTHER CLARIFICATION BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS FOR THE RECORD. AND THAT IS THAT UNLIKE OTHER. COMMITTEES WILL THIS HAS A TWO CHARACTERISTICS ARE DIFFERENT THE OTHER COMMITTEES ONE IS THAT IT HAS MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES. ARM AND TO I AM THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MEMBERS WILL SUBMITTED AUDIT LETTER. I WANT TO FIND MYSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY SUBMITTED AUDIT LETTER AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT WASN'T SET OR WOULD EVEN KNOW WITH EXISTED BECAUSE STAFF AND FOR MY STAFF THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS THE CASE BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES I'M TOLD. WORLD AUDIT LETTER WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEN IT'S WITHDRAWN. IN THE CASES OF THE WITHDRAWAL IT'S NOT NOTICE BECAUSE LIKE WE HAVE ON THE HEARING TODAY CERTAIN MEMBERS WHO ACTUALLY JOINED TOGETHER IN THIS IN THE IN AN ALTERNATIVE AUDIT LETTER WHICH IS FINE BUT THE NOTION IS IN THE BILL RULES OR VOTING ON TODAY IS THAT. EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF EITHER HOUSE OF EITHER PARTY WHO SUBMITS AND WANTS TO PURSUE AN AUDIT WHETHER WE CHOOSE TO PURSUE IT OR NOT IS A SEPARATE QUESTION IS COMMITTEE. BUT THAT IT COMES BEFORE THE FULL BODY THAT'S THE THING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND I THINK. AND THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS YES CORRECT THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS YES IT'S GOING TO BE CARRIED THROUGH AS PREVIOUS AUDIT COMMITTEE RULES -- THAT WE SEEN IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT WE DO ALLOW THE AUTHOR OF ANY AUDIT REQUEST TO PULL THEIR REQUEST UPON -- THEY'RE PREPPY IF THEY IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO DO SO. BUT THAT SAID DEPENDENT ON THE U. PROVIDED ONLINE ALLIANCE OF WHICH YOU PUT YOU GIVE THAT OPTION UP AND UP UNTIL WHICH AT THAT TIME LINE BEFORE EACH COMMITTEE. THEY CAN'T PULL IT IS HEARD BEFORE THE FULL COMMITTEE. THOSE ARE THE COMMITTEE DEADLINES CAREER LATER QUESTOR NOT A REQUEST TO BE IN BY A CERTAIN DATE SO THAT THE COMMITTEE CAN DO ITS WORK. THE AUDITOR CAN TO HER DUE DILIGENCE ABOUT TRYING TO ESTIMATE THE COST IN THE HOURS THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO FULFILL SUCH AUDIT. BUT IT IS UP TO THE REQUESTED AT THAT TIME WHETHER OR NOT THEY WISH TO PURSUE. THAT HONOR REQUEST TO BE HEARD BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. OR TO WITHDRAW THE REQUEST. SO HOPEFULLY THAT BRINGS CLARITY AND I'D LIKE TO OBVIOUSLY WELCOME THE NEW MEMBERS TO J. LACK AS WELL AS WELL AS MYSELF. AND WITH THAT I'LL ASK FOR A MOTION TO ADOPT THE RULES SO MOVE. RIGHT MOVE BY MISTER ROTH SECOND BY MISTER BORDERS -- COMMITTEE SECTOR CALL THE ROLL. MOTION TO ADOPT THE COMMITTEE RULES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER SALAS AYE SALAS AYE. BOERNER HORVATH.

LAST TEN YEARS IT DID NOT HAS NOT BEEN THAT CONSISTENT WE'VE GROWN A LITTLE BIT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SO IT WE WERE SMALLER. PROBABLY SIX OR EIGHT YEARS AGO. I HAVE ASKED THE CHAIR THIS AND I'M JUST GOING TO ISSUE SPOTTED FOR THE COMMITTEE. OUR AND I KNOW THAT THE TALKS POKEY TOLD ME TO A SPOKE TO THE VICE CHAIR ON THIS COMMITTEE I'M INTERESTED IN IN YOUR ESTIMATES. AND HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU'VE BEEN YOU COME IN AND WE WERE MAKING DECISIONS BASED UPON ESTIMATES -- BUT THE QUESTION I'M ASKING IS IN THE EVENT THAT THE ESTIMATE IS. UP UNDER IS OKAY BUT IF IT'S OVER YOU COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE TO ASK FOR FURTHER FOR FURTHER APPROVAL OF THE AMOUNT OF A PROBATION. WE DO NOT COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IF AN AUDIT ENDS UP GOING IT ENDS UP COSTING MORE THAN WHAT. THE ESTIMATES ARE IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS -- IN LOOKING AT OUR WORK -- WE IT SOME THAT COME IN UNDER BUDGET THERE ARE SOME THE END UP GOING OVER BUDGET THE REASON IS A LOT OF TIMES WE END UP GOING OVER BUDGET IS THIS IS OUR BEST GUESS WE HAVEN'T HAD THE UP TO TALK TO THE DEPARTMENTS. SOMETIMES WE RUN INTO ACCESS ISSUES SOMETIMES IT'S ISSUES WITH THE DATA -- BUT IN IN THEY ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE DONE AND IT'S AT LEAST A YEAR AND A HALF OLD TO BE FULL DISCLOSURE. MOSTLY THE AUDITS ARE WITHIN NOW WE PRESENT -- I PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE. BUT THE REASON REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENTS OR AND OR THE AGENCIES AND OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE JUNIATA FROM. WELL THE AUDITS ARE -- PRO RATED BASICALLY OUT TO DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES THERE'S A PROCESS WE USE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE HAVE TO PRESENT THAT INFORMATION TO FINANCE AS FAR AS HOW MUCH EACH OF THE AUDITS HOW MUCH TIME YOU TO THE OUT ITS. TO HOW MUCH IT COST AND THEN THAT SPREAD AMONG THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT WE OUGHT IT AND WHAT ABOUT OF THE LOCAL MANDATE RULE WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THESE AUDITS AND REQUIRING OTHER. NON STATE JURISDICTIONS TO BE ADDED -- THERE ARE SPECIFIC RULES RELATED TO LOCAL. I DON'T REMEMBER [inaudible] THAT. THE FORMER QUE. PLEASE APPROACH MY LAST QUESTION. IT IS OPTIONAL YEAH BOB PULLED OFF CHEAP EVERY STEP DAUGHTER. CENTER HERTZBERG THAT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TAKES ALL OF OUR INFORMATION INCLUDING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARTISTS THAT WE DO AND TO THEIR PROCESS THROUGH A PRO RATA PROCESS STATE. THE BILL BACK TO YOU THE STATE AGENCY OR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THEY DO IT IS NOT A LOCAL MANDATE IN TERMS OF THE STATE A WRITTEN QUESTION AUDIT AND THEN. THERE'S THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE OF REIMBURSEMENTS AND OFFICER ASKING LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD OR SOMETHING TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THEIR BUDGETS THAT. THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THE ON AS FAR AS AS FAR AS MY UNDERSTANDING IS NOT A LOCAL IT IS NOT A REIMBURSABLE STATEMENT. THANK YOU. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE DíAS. OKAY HEARING AND SEEING NONE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER THREE THE OUT ITS FOR THE J. LACK CONSIDERATION -- WE DISPENSE WITH THE CONSENT CALENDARS ITEMS NUMBER ONE AND TWO WE WILL MOVE TO THE REGULAR CALENDAR AND WE WILL BEGIN WE ARE AND SIGN IN ORDER SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH -- AGENDA I'D TWO ZERO ONE NINE DASH ONE ZERO FOUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES SUPPORT OF HOMELESS STUDENTS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CHIU -- MISTER RAMOS AND MISS REAVIS THEY'VE ALSO ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO DISPLAY. A POSTER BOARD. OF THE ISSUE THEY WILL PRESENT. ON THIS MORNING. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO THE WORK OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ON THIS REQUEST AND THIS IS MY FIRST ORDER REQUEST MY FOUR PLUS YEARS. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE CONTEXT OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST. IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING THE MOST INTENSE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS INTERSTATES HISTORY AND THIS PARTICULARLY IMPACTS STUDENTS. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OVER A QUARTER MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA ARE HOMELESS THIS IS A STUDENT HOMELESSNESS CRISIS DRIVEN BY A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SKYROCKETING INEQUALITY IN EXTREMELY HIGH CHILD POVERTY RATES. THE CRUX OF THIS REQUEST IS BASED ON TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DATA COLLECTED BY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES COMPILED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WHICH SAYS THAT OVER A QUARTER OF ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ALMOST TWENTY SIX HUNDRED CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND FOUR HUNDRED DISTRICTS HAVE REPORTED EXACTLY ZERO HOMELESS STUDENTS. THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE GIVEN THE HOMELESSNESS WE ARE ALL SEEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE THINK IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THERE ARE EXACTLY ZERO HOMELESS STUDENTS AND A QUARTER OF K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE. THROUGH THIS AUDIT WE HOPE TO UNDERSTAND WHY STUDENT HOMELESSNESS IS GOING UNDER REPORTED WHAT BARRIERS ARE FACING SCHOOLS AND IDENTIFIED THE STUDENTS AND WAS BACK WHAT BEST PRACTICES EXIST. FOR DISTRICTS IN PROVIDING THE SUPPORT THE STUDENTS NAY. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL STATE LAW TO IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS AND PROVIDE THEM SERVICES. IF THEY'RE NOT BEING COUNTED THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE CRITICAL SERVICES THEY NEED FROM HEAD START TO PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS ETCETERA. THE STUDENTS IN YOUR BASS THE DIFFERENCE AND THEY NEED SERVICES TO SUCCEED. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE WE IGNORE IT. APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I WANT TO THANK OUR CORE QUAESTORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS REAVIS AND ROSS FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE I'M GOING TO TURN OVER TO MR THIS [inaudible] ASSEMBLY WOMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL -- I WANNA THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR LEADING THIS AUDIT REQUEST AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS FOR HIS PASSION TO HELP HOMELESS YOUTH -- AT MY OLD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- IN LOS ANGELES UNIFIED 24% OF THE CHILDREN ARE CONSIDERED HOMELESS. UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS MAP OF THIS IS A STATE WIDE ISSUE FROM YOUR RICA TO SALLY NICE TO SAN DIEGO YOU KNOW WHERE THE RED SPOTS INDICATE -- THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HOMELESS AT OUR SCHOOLS -- I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE FIRST HAND AND HOW HOMELESSNESS AFFECTS OUR CHILDREN. I FOUNDED A NON PROFIT THAT WORKS WITH YOUNG GIRLS TO GET THEM INTERESTED IN STEM. AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT STUDENTS WASN'T SHOWING UP TO OUR PROGRAM AND I ASSUME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS AN INTEREST IN STEM ANYMORE. BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS HOMELESS. AND WASN'T THINKING ABOUT STEM SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT AND WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO EAT BECAUSE SHE WAS SLEEPING IN THE CAR WITH HER MOM. THIS IS SADLY SOMETHING CHILDREN IN MY DISTRICT FACE EVERY DAY AND UNFORTUNATELY CHILDREN STATEWIDE ARE ALSO FACING. CALIFORNIA HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMELESS SCHOOL CHILDREN YET OVER FOUR HUNDRED DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED EVEN A SINGLE HOMELESS STUDENTS WERE FAILING THESE CHILDREN. THE STATE NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE OUR FAILURES ARE TAKING PLACE SO THAT EVERY STUDENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS REQUEST -- AND NEXT ALL HIGH HANDED OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROMMEL'S. DRAMAS PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- CHIU IN REVERSE FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD AND SUPPORTING OUR HOMELESS YOUTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS MY COLLEAGUES STATED WE ARE CONCERNED ON THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS WHICH REPORT LOW TO NO HOMELESS STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE FOURTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THIS AUDIT WILL EXAMINE A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY ANSWER MARINO COUNTY. TO GAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW OUR SCHOOLS ARE PROVIDING AND REFERRING SERVICES TO OUR HOMELESS YOUTH. WELL I SAT ON ASSEMBLY -- COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE WORK TO IDENTIFY HOMELESS YOUTH WITHIN THE COUNTY INFORMED A HOMELESS YOUTH TASK FORCE WITH A CO CHAIR BRENDA DOWDY FROM THE COUNTY SCHOOLS. IN THE AREA THAT'S THERE. I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE TO REVIEW THE DATA AND PRACTICES AND LEARN ON AREAS THAT CAN BE IMPROVED. AND WITH THIS AUDIT WE WILL PROVIDE OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS THE CRITICAL TOOLS THAT WILL LEAD TO SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF HOMELESS YOUTH BECOMING HOMELESS ADULTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. OKAY NEXT WILL MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR PRESENTATION ON THIS I REQUEST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS THE MEMBERS INDICATED THIS IS AN AUDIT AND HOMELESS HOMELESS YOUTH AND SCHOOLS SO WE WOULD START THE FIRST OBJECTIVES THEY'VE ASKED US TO ACCOMPLISH IS. AT THE STATE LEVEL LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION WHAT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES DO THEY HAVE IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING PART OF EDUCATION HAS A LOT OF THE DATA SO WILL SPEND. SOME TIME WITH THEM CERTAINLY TRYING TO CAPTURE THAT DATA AND DOING ANALYSIS OF THE DATA ALSO LOOKING TO SEE WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE DOES THE STATE LEVEL PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT EDUCATION BUT ALSO THE BOARD. PROVIDE TO ELLIE ETS AND HELPING THEM IDENTIFY HOMELESS YOUTH AND CERTAINLY IDENTIFY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE TO THE KIDS IN THEIR PARTICULAR DISTRICTS -- ALSO ASKING US TO LOOK AT HOW COLLABORATION IS WORKING -- BETWEEN THE STATE LEVEL AND LOCAL LEVEL CERTAINLY THE ELEAZAR THE DISTRICT LEVEL AND THE SCHOOLS -- THEY'VE ASKED US TO LOOK AT A THREE YEAR WINDOW THREE FISCAL YEARS TO TRY TO CAPTURE THE DATA TO LOOK FOR TRENDS SO AGAIN I'M. IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THAT WILL BE INFORMATION THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS I INDICATED MY OPENING COMMENTS WE HAVE IT AUDITOR'S WHO HELP US DO DATA ANALYTICS. SO WE WILL CERTAINLY DO -- WORK IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA AND TRY TO CATEGORIZE -- THE HOMELESS YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA AND RURAL ETCETERA THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THE MEMBERS HAVE ASKED US TO LOOK AT THEN THEY HAVE CPAS PACIFIED. THEY WANT US TO LOOK AT LEAST ONE CHARTER SCHOOL. AND THREE TO FIVE DAILY ACE THE BUDGET PROVIDED TO YOU TODAY IS ON THE HIGH END SO WE WANTED TO ESTIMATE IF WE GO TO A CHARTER SCHOOL AND FIVE ELLIE ACE. AND AS MISTER RAMOS INDICATED THEY SPECIFIED AT LEAST ONE IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY ONE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND ONE ACTUALLY THAT IS DOING A GOOD JOB OF IDENTIFYING HOMELESS YOUTH AND PROVIDING SERVICES. UP TO HOMELESS YOUTH SO THEY HAVE HELPED US WITH SOME OF THE SELECTION OF THOSE ELLIE ACE. AT EACH OF THE ALLEY A THEY'VE ASKED US TO LOOK AT WHAT METHODS ARE THOSE EARLY AGE USING TO IDENTIFY THE YOUTH WHAT TYPE OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ARE THEY RECEIVING -- AND WORKING WITH HOME HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS -- ARE THERE SPECIFIC LIAISONS AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL WHO ARE ASSISTING THE SCHOOLS IN IDENTIFYING THESE YOUTH. AGAIN LOOKING AT COLLABORATION IS THEY'RE SHARING OF DATA AMONG SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- DO THE ELLIE ETS -- PURSUE ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO ASSIST THEM IN IDENTIFYING THESE YOUTH AND HOPEFULLY PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE YOUTH SO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT EACH OF THE ALLEY ACE. AND THEN ANOTHER OBJECTIVE SIMILAR TO THAT IS LOOKING FOR BEST PRACTICES ARE THEIR TRENDS OUT THERE ARE THEIR BEST PRACTICES THAT WE'RE SEEING AT SOME OF THE EARLY EIGHTIES -- THAT OTHER ELEAZAR OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BENEFIT FROM SO WE WILL GO THROUGH THOSE SAME. QUESTIONS LOOKING AT MESSAGE FRIDAY SOUNDS COLLABORATION AT CETERA AS FAR AS IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION THEY'VE ASKED US TO ANSWER IS. LOOK AT NATIONAL INFORMATION IS THERE -- INFORMATION THAT OTHER STATES ARE ARE PRACTICES THAT OTHER STATES ARE USING THAT PERHAPS CALIFORNIA WOULD BENEFIT FROM. SO THE AUDITS THIRTY NINE HUNDRED HOURS AS I SAID IT IS ON THE HIGH END WE WE DECIDED TO ESTIMATED BASED ON FIVE ELEAZAR. THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND THEN THE WORK WE WOULD HAVE TO DO AT THE STATE LEVEL BOTH AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND AT THE BOARD. AN AUDIT OF THAT SIZE WILL TAKE QUITE A BIT OF TIME BUT ONE THIS IS AN AUDIT THAT -- IS CERTAINLY ARE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A SIGNING A COUPLE OF AUDIT TEAMS TO IT. SO TO THE EXTENT I HAVE STAFF ROLLING OFF I CAN ADD A TEAM TO THIS AUDIT SO THAT INSTEAD OF ONE TEAM GOING OUT TO SIX LOCATION I'VE GOT TWO TEAMS. AND AND THEY'RE OUT CONDUCTING AUDIT WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO GET THIS PROJECT DONE MORE QUICKLY AND GET THE INFORMATION TO THE MEMBERS -- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU I THINK AT THIS TIME WE TYPICALLY MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM THE DíAS. SO LET ME AT THIS TIME AND RIGHT REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AFFECTED AGENCIES TO THE TO GIVE TESTIMONY IF THEY SO. THEY WISH TO DO SO [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY IF YOU COULD PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD PRETTY GOOD GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE AND STAFF MY NAME IS KIND JACKSON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT. TONY THURMOND BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT IS IF THIS AUDIT WERE TO TAKE PLACE. IT COULD POTENTIALLY EDUCATE AND INFORM THE STATE IN REGARDS TO EDUCATION HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. THE STATE COULD GAIN A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF MOST OF THE FEDERAL -- MCKINNEY VENTO THE MINUTE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIANS SERVERS CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH THAT OUR ROLE IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE UP FOR YOU THE LANDS UPON WHICH I VIEW THIS. AS A FORMER HOMELESS STUDENT IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. AS A SON OF A SINGLE CAFETERIA WORKER WHO IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES BECAUSE OF OUR HOMELESS DISLOCATION REQUIRED ME TO TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN SOUTH CENTRAL LA JUST TO GET. TO SCHOOL. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BELIEVE THAT ELEAZAR IDENTIFYING HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY WITH THE RESOURCES AND CAPACITY THAT THEY HAVE. ELLIE AGE RECEIVE SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A VARIETY OF WAYS. THIS AUDIT WERE TO HAPPEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BELIEVES THAT THE OUTCOME COULD DEMONSTRATE AN ISSUE OTHER THAN IDENTIFICATION. IT COULD ILLUMINATE BARRIERS THAT ELLIE ETS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FACES AND ALL AREAS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MCKINNEY VENTO ACT -- ONE OF WHICH IS LIAISONS DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY AND SLACK. BASED ON THE DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED FROM DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN APPLICATION PROCESS. FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE ELEAZAR REPORTED. FULL TIME EQUIVALENT FTE EASE OF LESS THAN POINT 5% WITH NINETY THREE OF THEM REPORTING LEDS INDICATING ZERO F. T. E. WHICH IS ALMOST THE HOMELESS LIAISON. THAT SAID WHILE I CANNOT SPEAK TO ALL ELEAZAR HAVE REACHED OUT TO DISTRICTS SO THAT I HAD A UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE GROUND LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SAN DIEGO UNIFIED THEY HAVE VERY STRONG WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR AGE PARTNER AGENCIES AND THE COUNTY. ARE THEY HAVE SCHOOLS I AND ONE PARTICULAR CASE PERKINS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION OF OVER 30%. THAT SAID. VERY SHE WAS NOT IDENTIFICATION BUT AS THE COMMITTEE TRIES TO GET I SUSPECT THERE DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE THAT DO HAVE IDENTIFICATION ISSUES. SO I I WOULD SAY ARE UNDER THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT THE HOMELESS PROGRAM WAS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP ASSA HOMELESS EDUCATION PLAN AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS. ONE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CONSULTANT TO SERVICE FOURTEEN HUNDRED HOMELESS LIAISONS AND THE STATE AND SHE'S HERE WITH US TODAY SHOULD YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING YOUR COMMENTS UNDER TWO MINUTES MOVE ALONG THROUGH THE AGENDA. AT THIS TIME -- I KNOW I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU BUT STATE AGENCIES THAT WOULD LIKE -- TO PROVIDE COMMENT AT THIS TIME ON THIS ITEM. OKAY HEARING AND SEEING NONE WE WILL NOW MOVE TO QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS AND IF I COULD JUST ASK ONE SINCE WE HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HERE -- YOU KNOW IN YOUR TESTIMONY HAD STATED ZERO F. TEASE A WE HAVE AN IDENTIFIED SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY HOMELESS STUDENTS OR WITHIN THE POINT 5% WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT DONE -- TO REACH OUT TO THOSE SCHOOLS TO FIND OUT WHY THEY'RE NOT REPORTING ANY OR DO THEY TRULY NOT HAVE ANY HOMELESS STUDENTS. I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S DONE WHAT ACTIONS OF DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN THE SUPERINTENDENT IS TAKEN TO HELP ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. IS A GOOD QUESTION ONE OF OUR BEST PRACTICES IS WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOME DISTRICTS PROVIDE A REPORT ZERO HOMELESS YOU STUDENTS ARE LIAISON DOES PROACTIVELY REACH OUT. TO THAT DISTRICT TO VALIDATE AND OR VERIFY IF THAT IS TRULY THE CASE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THEIR STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES -- FOR FOREIGN ROMAN AND REPORTING TRICKS. AND HOW MANY DISTRICTS ARE NOT REPORTING. I HAVE OUR TECHNICAL EXPERT HERE WITH ME WHO COULD -- A SUCCESS WITH WITH ONCE I HAVE SOME DATA HERE MAYBE THIS CAN HELP SAYS AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS WAS IN THE AUDIT LETTER THAT. WE WORKED WITH MR CHIU IN THE AUTHORS ON OVER A QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED OUT OF TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SCHOOLS REPORTED THAT THEY HAD IDENTIFIED NO HOMELESS STUDENTS AT ALL. SO MAYBE THAT. THAT HELPS BUT THAT NUMBER HAVE YOU REACHED OUT. TO THOSE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS IS THAT WHAT. YOUR TESTIMONY AS INDICATING. THE CALIFORNIA PLEASE COME TO THE MIKE. I'M LIANE WHEELER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I AM THE CONSULTANT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING THE LIAISONS AND THEIR LIAISE TO IMPLEMENT THIS LAW -- TYPICALLY IN THE PAST I BELIEVE I DON'T WORK AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL I WORK MORE AT THE L. THE A LEVEL BECAUSE THERE'S ONE OF ME AND FOURTEEN HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SO WHEN I I THINK THE LAST DATA THAT WE RECEIVED WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE ELEAZAR THAT REPORTS WERE. WERE IMPORTING ZERO HOMELESS STUDENTS. AND TYPICALLY WHAT I HAVE SEEN AS AS I REACH OUT TO THEM AND GIVE THEM THEY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE TECHNICAL SENSE. A LOT OF TIMES THEY REPORT BACK AND SAY WELL WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY STUDENTS ON OUR TOTAL POPULATION WE HAVE A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE ONE SCHOOL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS. THAT REPORT THIS AND THEY KNOW WHERE ALL THEIR HOMELESS STUDENT STUDENTS ARE. AND OR OR WHERE ALL THEIR CHILDREN OR STUDENTS ARE PERIOD AND SO THAT IS THE PRIMARY THING THAT WE DO. HAVE OUR OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. SO THEY'RE IDENTIFIED IN THEIR REACHED OUT. TO EVERY DISTRICT WIDE -- DISTRICTS STATEWIDE SCHOOL. OKAY FANTASTIC THANK YOU LET ME I KNOW SENATOR MINING. AS A QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. LET ME START BY THANKING THE REQUEST YEARS OF THIS ON IT -- IN MY AREA THE SALINAS SCHOOL DISTRICT REPORTS OVER 30% HOMELESS. THE THRUST OF A LOT OF THIS ON IT IS BETTER MONITORING BUT I KNOW PART OF IT IS ALSO TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES -- EITHER THE AUDITOR OR OR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I THINK THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEAN KIDS ARE NECESSARILY LIVING ON THE STREET IN SALINAS THEY MIGHT BE. SHARING A GARAGE WITH MULTIPLE FAMILIES WITHOUT. FACILITIES WITHOUT BATHROOMS ETCETERA. COULD ONE OF YOU SHARE FOR THE COMMITTEE WHAT WHAT CONSTITUTES HOMELESSNESS FOR SCHOOL STUDENT. YES SIR AND BROADLY BROADLY SPEAKING CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHO ARE SHARING HOUSING DUE TO A LOSS OF HOUSING ECONOMIC HARDSHIP OR SIMILAR REASON. LIVING IN MOTELS HOTELS TRAILER PARKS OR CRACK CAMPGROUNDS DUE TO A LACK OF ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATIONS LIVING IN EMERGENCY OR TRANSITION SHELTERS OR ABANDONED AND HOSPITALS. CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHOSE PRIMARY NIGHT TIME READ OR OR NEARLY USED AS A REGULAR SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION FOR YOU FOR HUMANS. CHILDREN AND YOUTH LIVING IN CARS PARKS PUBLIC SPACES ABANDONED BUILDINGS SUB STANDARD HOUSING BUS OR TRAIN STATIONS ARE SIMILAR SETTINGS MIGRATORY CHILDREN AND YOUTH LIVING IN ANY OF THE ABOVE. SITUATIONS THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL TO SHOW. THE SCOPE OF THIS -- WHEN WE HEAR 30% IN SALINAS THAT JUST SOUNDS STAGGERING IN BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE FACTORS THAT? THE CONSTANT HOMELESSNESS AND THEN A QUESTION I THINK FOR THE FOR THE AUDITOR. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE TO THIS OF HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WORK WAS SOCIAL SERVICES TO TRY. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FAMILY AND TO MOBILIZE SUPPORT. RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S A CLASSROOM SIDE OF HOW THIS HOW HOMELESS STUDENT PRESENTS. LEARNING CHALLENGES TEACHING CHALLENGES IN THE CLASSROOM WE'LL YEAR ON IT LOOK AT THOSE DIFFERENT ARENAS SOME MAYBE SHARE A LITTLE BIT HOW. HOW THE ON IT? DETERMINES BEST PRACTICES TO BE SHARED -- AS PART OF THIS ON IT. I THINK BEST PRACTICES WOULD BE IN THE EVENT WE WE SEE -- SITUATIONS WHERE. A STABLE ELEAZAR HAVE IDENTIFIED HOMELESS YOUTH AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARTNER WITH PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO GET SERVICES TO THOSE CHILDREN AND CERTAINLY LOOKING AT ANY NATIONAL. STUDIES THAT ARE OUT THERE RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS -- WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE INFORMATION IN TWO DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES RELATED -- TO IDENTIFICATION OF HOMELESS YOUTH BUT WORKING WITH PROVIDERS AND THAT WOULD BE IN MY VIEW THE SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE HOW ARE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WORKING WITH IN THE COMMUNITY. WE CONDUCTED AN AUDIT LAST YEAR LOOKED AT IT FROM THAT COMMUNITY SIDE OF IDENTIFYING HOMELESS. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST USE UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH IN PARTICULAR -- BUT THESE CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT ARE OUT IN EACH OF THE COMMUNITIES AND HOW THEY'RE IDENTIFYING TYPES OF SERVICES TO PROVIDE. A HOME TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS SO THE OBJECTIVE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO SPECIFIC ELLIE ACE GOING TO A CHARTER SCHOOL WE LOOK AT IT THERE AND THEN ALSO IN THE OBJECTIVE -- THAT THE MEMBERS HAVE ASKED US TO LOOK AT TRENDS AND OR BEST PRACTICES WE WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT THE SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE AND LIAISONS AND YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WORKING WITH -- COMMUNITY NOW PROVIDERS THANK YOU AND IF I MIGHT MISTER CHAIR JUST KIND OF A FINAL COMMENT OR QUESTION. MY GUESS IS THERE'S SOME OVERLAP WITH TRUANCY FIGURES -- ARE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMALA HARRIS -- WE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS TRYING TO DECRIMINALIZE TRUANCY AND REALLY FOCUS ON FAMILY DYNAMICS SCHOOL DYNAMICS AND SUPPORTING STUDENTS WERE THERE WAS CHRONIC. TRUANCY -- UNFORTUNATELY OUR FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL SPACE I THINK SOME MISINFORMATION IN THE MEDIA SUGGESTING THAT SHE SOUGHT TO CRIMINALIZE TRUANCY WHEN IN FACT IT WAS JUST THE OPPOSITE. WE WORK TO TO UNDERSTAND BUT I WOULD THINK THERE'S GONNA BE SOME OVERLAP. IN. STUDENT HOMELESSNESS. ENTRANCE HE TRANS AND IF THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- TO ADD TO YEAR INDICATORS I THINK THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. ALSO FOR FOLLOW UP FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO UNDERSTAND THAT BEHIND THAT STUDENT. IF WE FIND HOMELESSNESS HAD WE MOBILIZE SUPPORT RIGHT AT AND THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT SENATOR -- THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT WILL WILL TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT AND AND ABSOLUTELY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE I THINK YOUR OBSERVATION IS. A 100% CORRECT. OR WE JUST FOLLOWED DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE THOSE NUMBERS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE REPORT ZERO HOMELESS STUDENTS BUT HIGH TRUANCY RATES. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU GUYS CAN PROVIDER. MAYBE HELP ASSIST THE AUDITOR WITH. OTHER AT LEAST GO I JUST MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT TO DOVETAIL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO LOOK AT DIFFERENT AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO TAP IN AND HELP THE STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO HAD RECEIVED A FEDERAL GROUND GRANT OUTSIDE OF THE MCKINNEY VENTO GRANT. OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH A MINIMUM OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IS TARGETED AT EDUCATION AGENCIES. FOR HOMELESS YOUTH AT RISK USE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO ARM. IT YOU KNOW MAKE THESE NONSTANDARD PARK PARTNERSHIPS. WITH CITIES FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN THE LAST COMMENT I I WOULD JUST MAKE IS AS WE APPROACH THIS. IT I BELIEVE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE RESOURCES THAT DISTRICTS AND THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED TO ACTUALLY CARRY OUT THE WORK ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE -- ONE LIAISON TO SERVE -- FOURTEEN HUNDRED ELLIE ACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE -- CENTER WIENER HAS THREE I REQUEST IS FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT AUTO REQUEST TO US IN A A FULLY SUPPORT IT. ON I I THINK. THE NUMBERS THAT I'VE SEEN IN MAY PERHAPS ARE IT'S AN UNDERCOUNT BUT EVEN WITHOUT. PROBABLE UNDER CAL I'VE SEEN STATEWIDE. WE HAVE 5% OF STUDENTS ABOUT STATEWIDE THE NUMBERS THAT I'VE SEEN ARE HOMELESS. WHICH EVEN 5% IF IT EVEN IF IT'S NOT HIGHER THAT'S IT'S OUTRAGEOUS ARE PARTICULARLY OUTRAGEOUS AND CENTER MINING'S DISTRICT AND SALINAS AREA -- OUT BUT IT'S JUST IT'S SOME IT'S A IT'S A MORAL FAILING -- BY OUR STATE. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT I HOPE THAT THIS IS HELPS LAY GROUNDWORK FOR OTHER FORMS OF CHANGE ONE MORE DATA POINT IMPORTANT DATA POINT -- AND THERE'S TWO THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT THE FIRST IS THAT I THINK THAT THERE IS A PERCEPTION WITH THE HOMELESSNESS. CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A IT IS SIMPLY ABOUT -- MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION AND ALTHOUGH WE OF COURSE AND ARE HOMELESS POPULATION OF SIX SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CHALLENGES ABSOLUTELY -- SO MANY HOME HUGE OF PORTION OF OUR HOME SUBDIVISION ARE NOT. MENTALLY ILL ARE NOT ADDICTED THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING -- AND TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE. THEY'RE THEY'RE LIVING IN A SHELTER OR A CAR OR GOING FROM THE CHARTER MOTEL AND THERE'S SOME HELL ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER TO GET THEIR KID TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING TO GET TO WORK TO DO WITH THE NEW THAT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TO ME IT SHOWS HOW RESILIENT. PEOPLE ARE UP WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO HELP -- THESE FOLKS AND IT'S NOT IT WE CAN'T JUST FOCUS ONLY ON MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION IS A POOR AND THAT IS. IT'S ABOUT HELPING THEM. AND THAT GETS TO THE DEEPER ISSUE OF WHY ARE WE DRIVING FAMILIES IN THE HOMELESSNESS AND LET'S BE CLEAR IT'S NOT TO IT DOESN'T JUST RANDOMLY HAPPEN. WE AS A STATE DUE TO POLICY CHOICES AROUND HOUSING OR DRIVING FAMILIES IN THE HOMELESSNESS OR DRIVING FAMILIES IN THE POVERTY OR DRIVING CHILDREN IN THE HOME WITH US. BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO CREATE AN OF HOUSING IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA AT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND WE HAVE ALLOWED COMMUNITIES TO OPT OUT. THE BUILDING HOUSING WE HAVE ALLOWED COMMUNITIES -- TWO IS AFFECTIVELY PROHIBIT APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES -- AND DOT IS DRIVING PEOPLE IN THE HOMELESSNESS AND SO WE NEED FUNDAMENTAL REFORM -- INVESTMENTS AND SUPPORT FOR THESE FAMILIES BUT IT IS A BROADER POLICY QUESTIONS SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US TO FULFILL THE HOUSING NEED WE'VE STARTED ON THAT JOURNEY. THE LAST FEW SESSIONS AND WILL CONTINUE REDUCE YES THIS IS A FAN HOWEVER PLEASE BOERNER HORVATH WARNER. WE'LL GET IT -- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRING THIS ISSUE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I THINK I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME OF YOU. AND MY DISTRICT WHILE IT'S THAT COAST IS GENTLY -- AFFLUENT WE DO HAVE A POCKET OF POVERTY INVESTOR THE MCKINNEY VENTO NUMBERS ABOUT 10% OF THIS TO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CHILDREN. ARE HOMELESS. AND I AGREE WITH SENATOR WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S A MORAL FAILURE ON US THAT WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THE KIDS WITH THE ADVANTAGE THAT I HAVE GOING FOR IT. I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT ONLY HOUSING ITS HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO BE REALLY WORKING ON I WOULD -- ARE ALSO SUGGESTED THIS UNIFIED IS A GREAT EXAMPLE THAT HAS A VERY BROAD AND VERY DEEP MEASUREMENT OF MCKINNEY VENTO WHERE AS I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER CITIES IN MY DISTRICT I DON'T THINK HAVE AS BROAD AS IN DEEP SO. YOU'RE LOOKING AT I MAYBE ONE WITH BEST PRACTICE THAT MIGHT BE A SUGGESTION -- TO CONSIDER THAT -- ONE AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO ASK IS WE'VE PUT YOU KNOW I I KNOW WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL WE AT ACTIVE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AND I KNOW EVERY CITY OF MY DISTRICT DOES IN LAST YEAR'S MONEY FOR HOMELESSNESS OF THE COUNTIES SO HOW ARE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CORNING WITH THE COUNTIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED THE COUNTIES ACTUALLY GET TO SERVE THESE HOMELESS KIDS. CAN YOU ASSIST WITH THAT. GOING BACK TO THE DEFINITION COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND THERE'S A DEFINITION DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOUSING UNDER HOOD. AND EDUCATION SO A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES THAT ARE -- POSSIBLY IDENTIFIED AS HOMELESS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR HAD SERVICES AND THERE'S A DISCONNECT THERE BUT AGAIN GOING BACK -- TO MY COLLEAGUES DISCUSSION LIAISONS DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO MAKE THOSE COLLABORATION COORDINATION THEY'RE WEARING TWO THREE SOMETIMES FOUR FIVE HATS -- WITHIN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SO WE I LEAN ON THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION -- LIAISONS TO TRY TO BRING THOSE RESOURCES TO THEIR LIAISONS -- TO GET NO THE WHERE THOSE HOUSING PROGRAMS ARE WHAT SERVICES ARE THERE -- BUT IT IS A CAPACITY ISSUE. AND I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WHEN WE DO THIS AUDIT WILL WE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT WHAT OPTIONS. ARE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BEST PRACTICE OF SCHOOL TO DRESSING CHILD HOMELESSNESS -- AND USE HOMELESSNESS THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO HOW THEY DO CREATE THOSE BEST PRACTICES IN COORDINATION WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES BECAUSE HOPEFULLY WE'RE ALL WORKING ON OUT TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL OF REDUCING CHILD. AND YOUTH HOMELESSNESS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS FOR MEMBERS ON THE DíAS HEARING AND SEEING THAT AT THIS TIME WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. WE COULD LIVE IT LIMIT PUBLIC COMMENTS -- TO TWO MINUTES PER SPEAKER THAT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED. AT THIS TIME WHEN WE ASK IF THERE IS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS AGENDA ITEM. HEARING AND SEEING NINE HIGH WILL TURN IT BACK TO MEMBERS ON THE DíAS FOR A MOTION TO APPROVE [inaudible] SOME OF WITH TERMINATE SO MOVED BUT OF A SUBURB OF EXCUSE ME. I WAS CHAIRMAN I THOUGHT ONE QUICK QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT OR THE OTHER WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THE THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL. AGENCY OR THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN HONORED BY -- BY THE STATE. OKAY MAYBE IT'S A QUESTION FOR THE AUDITOR. AND HAVE BEEN THE AUDITOR FOR NINETEEN YEARS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT AN AUDIT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO HOMELESS YOUTH AND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAS COME. UP BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. WAS A SATISFACTORY HISTORY OKAY AT THIS TIME THEN LET ME ASK YOU SIR CLOSING COMMENTS FOR MANY OF THE AUTHORS. I WANT TO JUST APPRECIATE OF THE GOOD CONVERSATION OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK -- THE PART OF EDUCATION AND I KNOW YOUR COMMITMENT AND HELPING US. GET TO THE ANSWER HERE -- LET ME JUST ALSO ECHO SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID BY SENATOR WIENER -- OFTENTIMES THE FACE OF ABOUT STUDENTS AND WE THINK ABOUT WHERE STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS -- OFTENTIMES THEY ARE HIDDEN -- IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CHILDREN WHO WERE SLEEPING IN A TENT UNDER FREEWAY OR IN A FIELD BUT IT'S STUDENTS WHO ARE LIVING IN THERE. IN A CAR ON A ON A COUCH WITH THEIR FAMILY DOUBLE OR TRIPLE DUB -- IN A MOTEL A CAMPGROUND A HOTEL. IN THAT CREATES UNIQUE CHALLENGES -- FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TRYING TO IDENTIFY THIS -- I ALSO WANT TO MENTION I KNOW WAS ALLUDED TO THAT MANY OF THE SCHOOLS LISTED ARE SMALL SCHOOLS THAT IS TRUE. BUT I ALSO HAVE A LIST OF HUNDREDS OF THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE VERY LARGE SCHOOLS -- FACT OF GOD PAGES OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS AND OVER FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS AND IN MANY THE SCHOOLS THEY HAVE HUNDREDS IF NOT OVER A THOUSAND STUDENTS. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED MEAL PROGRAMS AND YET THEY'RE REPORTING EXACTLY ZERO HOMELESS STUDENTS AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING -- TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AGAIN APPRECIATE -- ALL THE WORK THAT I ONCE YOU'RE ON THIS AND IF ANYTHING THE ONE AND THANK YOU HEARING THIS REQUEST -- A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP I THINK HAVE TO DO WITH THE CAPACITY THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ON LIKE WE ONLY HAVE ONE HOMELESS COORDINATOR FOR THE WHOLE STATE AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS IS -- THE STATE WIDE ISSUE THE THAT NEEDS MORE RESOURCES AND I HOPE THAT. ON THROUGH THIS AUDIT AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE START -- WE CAN BEGIN TO ADDRESS THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN IN CLOSING THANK YOU FOR THE THE DIALOGUE THAT HAS GONE AROUND I'M HERE TODAY AT AROUND THIS DíAS -- DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS YOUTH IN THE HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT ARE THERE 30% IN SALINAS. SAN MARINO COUNTY WE HAVE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND HOMELESS STUDENTS -- IN SAN BENITO COUNTY ITSELF SO WE SEE IT AS AN AREA THAT CONTINUES TO START TO NEED DIALOGUE IN MOVING THIS ISSUE FORWARD THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP IN IDENTIFYING. RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE BARRIERS THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE -- TALKED ABOUT SO THAT WE CAN IN IDENTIFYING HELPING ARE HOMELESS YOUTH SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP BECOMING A DAHLE HOMELESS -- IN OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK THIS IS A PROACTIVE WAY TO LOOK AT THAT WE CONTINUE TO OPEN UP THE DIALOGUE AROUND THE HOMELESS YOUTH AND WITH THIS -- THE OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HERE SOME WOMEN CHAO AND AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVA SO WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS ITEM.

OKAY THAT MOTION CARRIES WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THAT ON THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AT THIS TIME WE WILL MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER. THREE TWO ZERO ONE NINE DASH IS ONE ZERO ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. AND QUIRK SILVA ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHATEVER WHEN YOU ARE READY TO BEGIN. THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- SOME OF YOU MAY REALIZE THAT SIX YEARS AGO -- THE STATE DRASTICALLY CHANGED ITS METHOD FOR FUNDING OF SCHOOLS -- IN THE K. TWELVE EDUCATION SYSTEM REPLACING OF THE A COMPLEX FUNDING METHOD THAT USE A LOT OF CATEGORICAL. OF THAT IT HAD IN PLACE FOR FORTY YEARS WITH WHAT WE CALL THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA ALSO KNOWN AS EL CFF. SB FF REQUIRES VARIOUS METHODS AND ACTIONS BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS. WITHIN A DISTRICT EL CAP IS REQUIRED TO ADDRESS EIGHT DIFFERENT POP PRIORITIES INCLUDING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND PUPIL ENGAGEMENT. A DISTRICT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO DESCRIBE ITS NEEDS SET GOALS AND PERFORM AND ALICE'S. TO DATE NO DETAIL REVIEW HAS TAKEN PLACE TO DETERMINE WHETHER FUNDS UNDER LC FF TOTALING MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SCHOOL YEAR BEEN SPENT APPROPRIATELY -- AND I NEED TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT WHEN THIS BILL WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED OUR THIS PROCESS WAS WE WE SHOULD THERE WOULD BE SOME -- ONGOING ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WITH REGARDS TO THE MONEY THAT WAS THE YEAR -- WE HAVE TRIED EACH YEAR TO ACQUIRE THAT INFORMATION AND HAVE YET TO HAVE FAILED TO DO SO SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR ANY TIME KNOW THAT WE HAVE -- PUT TWO OR THREE PIECES OF LEGISLATION ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK OFTEN WITH EIGHTY MEMBERS IN THE ASSEMBLY FORTY IN THE SENATE ASKING FOR THIS AND AND BEING VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR WHO FELT IT WAS TOO EARLY. TO ACTUALLY BEGIN TO EXAMINE WHAT WE HAD DONE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE STATE OUGHT TO FIND TO THEY'LL SEE IF THE FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED PROPERLY TO HELP STUDENTS ACHIEVE ACADEMIC SUCCESS. HOWEVER TEST SCORES AND NOT IMPROVING FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND OTHERS WERE ROUTINELY DIGNIFIED AS THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA K. TWELVE SYSTEM. I BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF BILL C. F. F. TO DETERMINE WHETHER DISTRICT EXPENDITURES ON LCF HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE AND OF LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANTS ARE MEETING THE GOALS NECESSARY TO ENSURE IMPROVED EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. FOR STUDENTS WERE CHRONICALLY LOW ACHIEVEMENT. AT THE BUDGET LEVEL WE ARE A COSTLY AND BEING PREPARED -- TO TO ADD MORE MONEY TO ELSE IF IF IT IS NOW CURRENTLY FULLY FUNDED. AND OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING WITH IT THE QUESTION BECOMES IS THIS THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD TO DO THE KIND OF FUNDING THAT WE WANT TO SEE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES TO ELSE EFF OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS. AND IS NOW HERE WE THAT DOWN THERE WAS A POCKET A SIGNIFICANT POCKET OF STUDENTS WHO ARE BEING AND WOULD BE UNSERVED AND LCF IN SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT IN AS A RESULT A TO READ AND IT RESULTED IN THREE HUNDRED MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS GOING TO THOSE. SPECIFIC STUDENTS WE MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS WHEN WE STARTED THIS LC FF AND I WAS INTRICATELY INVOLVED IN IT -- THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT THAT COSTS CHILDREN TO NOT TO DO WELL AND WE HAVE DONE A FIVE THOSE ISSUES ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT MAYBE THOSE WERE NOT THE REAL ISSUES THAT AFFECTED THE ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS. WE ALSO MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE WOULD NOT USE MONEY FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES LIKE SALARY INCREASES WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS CHANGED -- NOT BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT BY THE SUPERINTENDENT AT THAT TIME THAT THOSE MONIES CAN GO THERE THERE'S ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE SOME TRANSPARENCY THAT THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND THE PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE CATEGORICAL STUDENTS THAT ARE. EITHER LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO HAVE LANGUAGE ISSUES ARE STE ALL WHO ARE FOSTER CARE THOSE ARE THE CATEGORIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN TO SEE IF THAT MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING IN THAT DIRECTION. SO WE'RE REQUESTING AN AUDIT FOR AT LEAST THREE LARGE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT CONTAIN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE CONSIDERED LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS ACOSTA STUDENTS. THE STATE AUDITOR'S TO USE HER DISCRETION AND SELECT THE THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND PERFORM THE FOLLOWING WE HOLD. A DIGNIFIED EXCESS EACH SCHOOL DISTRICTS GOLD CONTAINED WITHIN THE EL CAP AND ELSEWHERE THAT AIM TO RAISING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT ESPECIALLY GOES INTO THE TO BENEFIT LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER KIDS. DETERMINE WHETHER DISH NO GOALS COULD BE HELPFUL TO EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN ASSURING THE SUCCESS OF THE STUDENTS. WATER DIGNIFIED EVALUATE ANY MEASUREMENT IN MEASUREMENT TOOLS USED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ASSESS SUCCESS IN EDUCATING STUDENTS INCLUDING STUDENTS ARE CATEGORIZE IT IN THOSE CATEGORIES. DETERMINE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SPENDS FUNDS TOTAL FUND AND SPENT ON WIDE AS WELL AS A SCHOOL WIDE BASIS. AGAIN A FIVE EXPENDITURES AT SCHOOLS BY CATEGORIES AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXPENDITURES ARE BEING SPENT APPROPRIATELY. FURTHER TO IDENTIFY THE FUNDING TO RECEIVE AN EXPANDED ON EACH SCHOOL BY CATEGORIES INCLUDING FUNDING CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED AND YOU'LL SEE A FAIR. TO EXTENT PRACTICAL REVIEW MULTIPLE SCHOOL YEARS AND HELP PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FUNDING AND EXPENDITURES OF CHAINS AND ELSIE FF. IDENTIFYING CAM AND EVALUATED SCHOOL DISTRICTS METHODOLOGY FOR DISTRIBUTING AND SPENDING FUNDS ON ITS STUDENTS OR IS VERY SCHOOLS. AND REVIEW AND ASSESS WHETHER EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT THE MOST RECENT L. CUP COMPLIES WITH THE SPIRIT AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH AL CATS. ESPECIALLY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVING MEASUREMENTS AND HELPING STUDENTS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF GROUPS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONICALLY LOW ACHIEVEMENT -- ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE EL CAP THAT MAY HELP IMPROVE THESE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS. MOST OF YOU HAVE SEEN. THE THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS IN TERMS OF FUNDING THE VARIOUS WAYS OF METHODS OF PRESENTING INFORMATION AND SUPPOSEDLY SHARING WITH PARENTS AND TERMS OF WITH. SOME SENSE OF TRANSPARENCY WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO TALK ABOUT CONTINUING FUNDING THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS THE MET THAT THAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE. TO GET TO THE GOALS WE SET FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS MAKING SURE THAT WE CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR GOALS OF THE LCS. LC FF AND ON THE GOVERNOR BROWN SO AS A RESULT OF THAT WE'RE REQUESTING AN AUDIT -- AS WE CAN. BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF THIS -- INCREASING LC FF. THANK YOU MISS WEBER APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- ITEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I MY UNDERSTAND YOUR PASSION I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS BEFORE US -- LET'S HAVE A PRESENTATION BY THE STATE AUDITOR ON THIS REQUEST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WILL MAKE THIS BRIEF IS DOCTOR WEBER DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF LAYING OUT WHAT SHE'S ASKED US TO DO AND WE HAVE ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IN THE ANALYSIS SO WE WILL DEFINITELY LOOK AT THREE LARGE. GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- AS SHE INDICATED SHE WANTS TO IF I DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE CONSIDERED LOW INCOME ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOUTH. AND AND LOOKING AT THE LCF THE FORMULA AND AS AS SHE INDICATED THE EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT EVALUATING THEIR METHODOLOGY FOR DISTRIBUTING AND SPENDING THOSE FUNDS DISTRICT WIDE AND AT THE VERY SCHOOLS WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR DISTRICT. SHE IS ALSO INTERESTED IN US LOOKING AT A THREE YEAR WINDOW SO WE WILL LOOK AT THREE FISCAL YEARS. AND AND LOOK AT THE EXPENDITURES AND THE FUNDING PROVIDED OVER THOSE THREE YEARS HOW HAS THAT FUNDING CHANGED HAS IT CHANGED AS FAR AS THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES THAT ARE BEING FUNDED ETCETERA. AND THEN. DETERMINE. FOR EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN A SELECTION OF SCHOOLS WITHIN THOSE DISTRICTS -- ARE THEY EXPENDITURES APPROPRIATE AND AGAIN IN WHICH CATEGORIES ARE THOSE EXPENDITURES BEING INCURRED AND IS THAT THE APPROPRIATE BEST USE OF THOSE FUNDS. AS SHE ALSO INDICATED WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS A LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS LOOKING AT THE GOALS AT EACH OF THE ELLIE AIDS HAS ESTABLISHED -- AND DO THOSE GOALS TIED TO RAISING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AGAIN PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO STUDENTS. WHO ARE LOW INCOME -- AGAIN. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOUTH -- ALSO ASKING US TO LOOK AT THOSE TO EDUCATED COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF L. C. F. F. -- IN IN ASSISTING CHRONICALLY LOW ACHIEVING STUDENTS. IMPROVE THEIR THEIR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND THEN AS SHE ALSO TALKED ABOUT LOOKING AT MEASUREMENTS -- ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE USING OUT WHAT TOOLS DO THEY USE AT EACH SCHOOL TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS THE SUCCESS OF STUDENTS ARE THERE ADDITIONAL TOOLS THAT. BOTH THE SCHOOLS AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN USE OCT TO AGAIN TRY TO ADDRESS -- LOW ACHIEVING STUDENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT THE L. C. F. F. MONEY IS BEING USED FOR THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE IN THOSE PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE BUDGET IS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED HOURS THE REASON FOR THAT IS AGAIN WE'RE GONNA BE GOING TO THREE DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEN ULTIMATELY IN SOME LOCATIONS DRILLING DOWN. TO INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS AND HOW THEY ARE USING LC FF MONEY. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION OF THIS TIME LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE ANY AFFECTED AGENCIES I WOULD LIKE. TO GIVE COMMENT AND WOULD APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU KEEP THIS COMES TO TWO MINUTES. HEARING AND SEEING NONE WE WILL RETURN BACK TO MEMBERS ON THE DíAS FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -- ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO PLEASE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU DOCTOR WHATEVER -- FOR BRINGS UP I WAS A SCHOOL TEACHER AND ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS -- THAT I HAD I WAS A REDWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CASEY OF UNFUNDED DISTRICT TO GO ON IT YET -- BY -- BUT WITH THAT MY SCHOOL IN PARTICULAR WAS A 100% -- OF REDUCED -- LUNCH AND MY FRUSTRATION WAS THAT THE THE KIDS IN MY SCHOOL WERE THE ONES THAT QUALIFIED FOR THE ADDITIONAL FINES. AND WHEN WE KEPT ASKING WHERE THE MONEY WAS COMING OF WHERE THE MONEY WAS GOING THEY SAID ALL WE HAVE TO BE -- EQUITABLE AND GAVE AROUND THE WHOLE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH WAS. ALWAYS MY AT MY FIGHT IF THE KIDS IN MY SCHOOL WERE THE ONES A QUALIFIED FOR FOR THE EXTRA FUNDING THAN THE KIDS IN THAT SCHOOL SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE MONEY. AND SO -- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR FOR THE FOR BRINGING THIS WAR AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHEN THE FILE THESE OUT OF THE L. CAPS THEY AND THE PLANS THAT THEY HAVE WHERE DO THEY GO IT FEELS LIKE TO GO TO SOME BLACK HOLE SOMEWHERE. AND DO THEY GET AN APPROVAL DO THEY GET -- I DON'T SOME KIND OF A ACCOUNTABILITY OR YES R NO LIKE OUR BUDGETS TO THE BUDGETS GO TO THE TO THE TO THOSE THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND THEY GET A EITHER A THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN. DO IS THAT TRUE FOR THE EL CAP AS WELL AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER -- IF YOU COULD PROVIDE AGAIN DOCTOR WEBER THIS IS -- SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN -- EATING AT ME FOR A LONG TIME AS WELL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS PART BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF OUR KIDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE -- THESE CHALLENGES ARE NOT BEING SERVICE AND I THINK WITH THIS WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE MONEY THAT WE ARE PROVIDING FOR THEM. THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS WILL MOVE TO SENATOR ROTH AND SENATOR DRAWS OF INSIDER MINING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DR RONA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS MATTER FORWARD I'VE BEEN. INTERESTED IF NOT CONCERN FOR SOME TIME ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EL CAP PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONCENTRATION GRANT WITH ITS FIFTY OVER 55% REQUIREMENT. IN TERMS OF GETTING THE MONEY DOWN WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF THE IN PARTICULAR THE DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS IN OUR IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM AS YOU WELL KNOW MUCH. MORE THAN I YOU CAN HAVE TO DISTRICTS -- IN A LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE. AND ONE DISTRICTS CAN HAVE MORE THAN THE 55% DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS THE OTHER DISTRICT HAS LESS THAN 55% OF THE DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS -- REQUIREMENT. YOU CAN HAVE SCHOOLS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LINE WITH THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. FOSTER KIDS AND ONE SCHOOL 50% INCREASE IN THE CONCENTRATION GRANT AND THE SCHOOL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINE DOES NOT GET THE 50% CONCENTRATION GRANT. YET THEY'RE EDUCATING THE SAME STUDENT POPULATION THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME SO. MADAM AUDITOR I LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF YOUR AUDIT AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONCLUSIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU LET'S MOVE THIS CENTER DRAWS A THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR MAKING THIS PROPOSAL OUT TO COVER THE SCHOOLS ON THIS ISSUE -- ONE QUESTION IS. UP. THE THE CRITERIA FOR YOUR SELECTION OF WHICH SCHOOLS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT COULD FIT PROBABLY. I DON'T KNOW HUNDRED HUNT HUNDREDS. ALL OF THEM I MEAN MOST OF THEM SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT WOULD GO INTO THE PROCESS THAT'S THAT'S ONE AND IF IN THE PROCESS. THERE WAS A WAY OF FIGURING OUT THERE MAY BE SCHOOLS FOR PARENTS OR COMMUNITY WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED. IN THE PROCESS OF EL CAP TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK AS MUCH AS A POSSIBLE -- A WORK FOR THE RIGHT WAYS AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT MAYBE SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO LIST HERE LIKE PARENT AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS. BUT HOW COULD WE GET TO THAT AS WELL BIG. A I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE MODELS FOR IT TO WORK GOOD AND WHERE THE BAD MODELS OF NOT TO FOLLOW AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EXACTLY. YOU KNOW BY NUMBERS THAT WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT THANK YOU THE OF THE LAW THAT TALKS ABOUT L. C. F. F. AS WELL AS EVEN THE L. CAPS TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENT ENGAGEMENT PARENT INVOLVEMENT. AND THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO THESE PLANS IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRESENTED TO PARENTS. AND APPROVED BY APPEARANCE AND MOST DISTRICTS IF YOU GO TO BAY PARENTS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON WELL EITHER WAY IT'S FOR PRINT PRESENTED TO THEM IT'S ALL DONE IN ITS HANDED FOR THEM TO SAY OKAY -- AND MOST OF THEM THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON AND IF YOU READ THE L. CAPS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ON THE INTERNET THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNED FOR PARENTS ARE BUT REALLY DESIGNED FOR IT. I DON'T KNOW RESEARCHERS MAYBE BECAUSE MOST PARENTS AND MOST OF US CAN'T READ THEM CORRECTLY. AND SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHAT'S PARENTS AS OPPOSED BE INVOLVED SO AS THEY LOOK AT THE LAN SAY WHAT OKAY WHAT WOULD THIS THING SUPPOSED TO DO ONE OF THE PIECES WAS PLANNING GAVE ME. IT IS A LAYS SO WHAT YOU'LL YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IN THE REPORT WHO WHO PUT THEIR PLANS TOGETHER WHO USE PARENT INVOLVEMENT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT ENGAGE WITH THAT SHOULD BE THERE AS A PART OF IT AS SOMETIMES BEEN LOST. AND OR EITHER DIMINISHED IN TERMS OF PAN ROLE IN IT -- AND DOES SO AS A RESULT I'VE OF PARENT ENGAGEMENT PARENT INVOLVEMENT HOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PLAN WAS AND I SAY WELL YOU DISTRICT AS OPPOSED TO DO THIS AND THEY SAID WELL THEY DIDN'T ALL THEY CAME IN A MEETING. SLAP IT ON THE TABLE TOTAL THIS IS WHAT IT WAS AND THEN IT WENT ON TO SOMETHING ELSE AND SO SO THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE AND IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LAWN WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES IT REQUIRES A LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT. SO WITH THAT WORK. WOULD THAT BE PART OF THE SELECTION PROCESS OR HOW HOW COULD THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE LEFT IT UP TO OUR OUR AUDITOR TO PICK THAT SCHOOLS WE HOPE THAT THERE ARE LARGE ENOUGH SCHOOLS WHERE THEY HAVE THE KIND OF DIVERSITY OF PROGRAMS. AND RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE BOB AND WHICH WANTED SOMEONE DOING BETTER THAN OTHERS -- SOME SCHOOLS ARE DOING BETTER THAN OTHERS WITHIN A DISTRICT ITSELF SO WE KIND OF LEFT IT TO THE AUDITOR'S WE WOULDN'T. WE WOULDN'T HAVE JUST A A KIND OF A SPECIALTY SCHOOL WHERE IT ONLY HAVE CERTAIN THINGS THAT HAPPEN BUT BROUGHT ENOUGH IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS AND STUDENTS AND THE POPULATIONS IS THERE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHAT WE DISCOVER IF YOU'VE GOT A DISTRICT WHERE. THE WHOLE DISTRICT AND SO I THINK THAT MAYBE ONE OF SAN DIEGO WHERE EVERYBODY'S FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH WITH THE MONEY COMES IN AND MAKE IT COULD BE DISPERSED ALL THE KIDS. TO PRINT AND THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS BUT OFTENTIMES THE CHALLENGE BECOMES IN THE LARGE DISTRICT WHERE YOU HAVE THE SOMETIMES A DIVISION BASED ON ECONOMICS. AND SO THE MONEY COMES IN ESOS THE DISTRICT REALLY TAKEN THAT EXTRA MONEY AND PUTTING IT INTO THOSE SCHOOLS THAT REALLY NEEDED ARE THEY ARE THEY DISTRIBUTING IT A WIDELY AND BROADLY TO EVERYBODY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- WHEN AND I GUESS MOST OF YOU KNOW I WAS I WAS SO INVOLVED IN THIS BECAUSE WHEN THE WHEN I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY THE GOVERNOR ASKED ME TO HELP HIM GET THIS THROUGH? AND THERE WERE TWO OF US WHO REALLY WORKED HARD -- ONE DEMOCRAT MYSELF IN THE REPUBLICAN. AND PART OF THAT WAS THAT THEY WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY. THERE WOULD BE TRANSPARENCY I SAID YOU CAN GIVE PEOPLE MONEY AND THEN I TELL THEM WHAT TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE I CAN GUARANTEE IT WILL NOT GO WHERE YOU WANTED TO GO. SO WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY THERE'D BE TRANSPARENCY AND ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS AND ALL OF US WENT BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS AND TOLD OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT ARE STRUGGLING YOU'RE GOING TO GET 20% MORE FOR THESE KIDS ISSUE AND THIS THE NEXT AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND WE AND IT NEVER REALLY MATERIALIZE THAT WAY IN MOST DISTRICTS. SO -- SO WE LOOKED AT IT AND AND IN MANY WAYS -- SOME OF THE MY CONCERN IT IT HAS TO DO WITH MY OWN PERSONAL INTEGRITY OF INSURING TO PEOPLE THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN I WAS NUMBER. ONE BUT NUMBER TWO THAT WE HAVE DISTRICTS THAT MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SUPPORT THIS EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW KNEW THAT THERE DISTRICT WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM IT. BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH OF FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH KIDS IN THAT HAVE NOTHING FALL SECURE BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD USE THE MONEY APPROPRIATELY. TO HELP KIDS WITH STRUGGLING IN ALL OF US WHO SIGNED ON TO IT BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF WE HAD DISTRICTS BUT CERTAIN DISTRICTS THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH STUDENTS. THE COMMITMENT WAS AT THE STATE LEVEL THEY AND AS A RESULT THOSE AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES MIGHT SUFFER QUOTE UNQUOTE BUT NOT GIVING THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY. THAT WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE DISTRICT SO I FEEL SINCE IT AND I HOPE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES IT WE HAVE TO BE HAVE SOME INTEGRITY ABOUT THIS. THAT THOSE DISTRICTS TRUSTED US TO ENSURE THAT IF WE TOOK MONEY THAT WAS NOT DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY ACROSS THE STATE. THAT WE WOULD DO WOULD DUE DILIGENCE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE KIDS ARE STRUGGLING THE HEART IS WOULD GET THE RESOURCES THAT WE WOULD CLOSE THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE WAYS OF DOING SO WITHOUT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN DISCUSSION IT MAY IT'S NOT HAPPENING AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S A PART OF IT. THE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO BUT WE'LL SEE IF IF AND AS WE TALK ABOUT MOVING FORWARD I DON'T WANT TO GET DOWN TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW AS WE HAVE WITH ALL THE CATEGORIES AND DISCOVER WHAT YOU KNOW IT WAS A BAD PLAN. WE CITIZENS OF MALES WE COULD LOOK AT IT A DIFFERENT WAY -- IT IS AFTER FIVE YEARS IT IS TIME FOR US TO ASSESS WHAT THE NOT GUILTY OF THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO. AND IS THIS WAY THAT WE FEEL WE CAN FIND OUR SCHOOLS AND ACTUALLY GET THE RESOURCES. TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT BUT MOST IMPORTANT TO GET THE RESULTS WE WANT ALL THE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND APPRECIATE YOUR DUE DILIGENCE ON THAT I REMEMBER THAT DISCUSSIONS IN THE FIGHTS WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING LC FF AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN -- TO ASSIST THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT REALLY NEED IT OKAY AT THAT TIME SIR MUNNINGS QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON. THANK YOU JUST A COMMENT -- WANTED -- TO ECHO THAT THE CONCERN THAT SENATOR ROTH RAISED WITH RESPECT -- TO WE WE HAVE TO SCHOOL DISTRICT ONE LARGER ONE SMALLER -- BASICALLY YOU CAN GO DOWN A MAJOR ROAD IN FRESNO AND CLOVIS AND ON ONE SIDE IT'S ONE ON THE OTHER IT'S THE OTHER. THE PERCENTAGES IN THE LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE ARE OBVIOUSLY -- A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE BUT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGES LAST THEN OBVIOUSLY IN THE SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICT. RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET IN ONE DISTRICT AS COMPARED TO ANOTHER THE SAME CHILD WITH THE SAME PATHOLOGIES IN THE SAME ISSUES. IS GETTING HALF AS MUCH PER PUPIL AS THE ONE SIMPLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. THE SECOND AREA OF OF CONCERN IS THAT THE SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICT. IS ACTUALLY SEEING A LARGE INFLUX OF PARENTS REQUESTING. AT THE MOVE FROM THE LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH ALL THE LC INVEST MONEY INTO A THE SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WHY IS THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICT. ACROSS THE STREET WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND WITH POVERTY CHILDREN IS ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE. AND FAMILIES ARE BEGINNING TO KIND OF FIGURE THAT OUT. AND SO THERE IS A SENSE AT LEAST IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT BIG GAPS ARE THE FUNDING -- BUT SMALLER BUT SUCCESSFUL -- TO GET HALF AS MUCH SO THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISPARITY THERE IF REACHING. FAMILIES AND KIDS IS IT ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND POVERTY KIDS IS THE GOAL WE OUGHT TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS PERCENTAGES MAY BE. SMALLER BUT THE ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT. IS SUPERB AND THAT OUGHT TO BE WORDED RATHER THAN IN SOME INSTANCES WHERE. SOME PARENTS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FEEL THAT THAT THERE'S A PENALTY FOR IT SO THAT'S THAT'S JUST A OBSERVATION FROM. THE DISTRICTS IN OUR IN IN IN WHERE I REPRESENT. BUT I THINK IN YOU'VE DISCOVERED ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT IMPACT. STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND STUDENT SUCCESS AND THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT IT'S NOT JUST DEPENDENT UPON THE MONEY THAT YOU GET BUT MORE IMPORTANT SO IT DEPENDS UPON THE PEOPLE IN THE CLASSROOM. AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE LEADERSHIP AT THAT SCHOOL TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN FOR KIDS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GIVING MONEY. IT WILL NOT. MAKE A DIFFERENCE UNLESS IT IS APPROPRIATELY USED AND IN THE CLASSROOM FOR STUDENTS AND I THINK WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT OVER THE YEARS AS WE'VE SEEN MONEY INCREASE. WE NOT NECESSARILY SEEING THE RESULTS BECAUSE IT WOULD DO SOME THINGS BUT IT WON'T DO EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW AND AND SOMETIMES OF SMALLER DISTRICT IS MORE DESIRABLE BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS SOME LARGE DISTRICTS STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO LARGE. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT DON'T FOCUS ON SOMETIMES THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. APPRECIATE THE CONCERN ABOUT AND THANK YOU THE SALMON MOVED TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEEP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF A MISS OUR IN IN YOUR NINETEEN YEARS AS A STATE AUDITOR OF WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME. YOU AUDIT OF THE LC FF AND E. L. K. F. IS RELATIVELY NEW MR DEEP.

IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AS DOCTOR WEBER INDICATED -- IT IT HAS NEVER BEEN AUDITED SO THIS WOULD BE A FIRST LOOK AT HOW WELL HAS THIS PROGRAM THE PROGRAM'S BEEN IN PLACE LONG ENOUGH. FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT -- BUT IT WOULD BE THE FIRST LOOK AT LC FF AND CERTAINLY THE USE OF EL CAPS NOW SOME OTHER AUDITS THAT WE'VE DONE WE HAVE LOOKED AT L. CAPS.

GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR ENTERTAINING THIS REQUEST I'M HERE TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. THAT THE COMMITTEE APPROVED A FINANCE -- MY SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IS IN A SEVERE A BUDGET DEFICIT LIVE LITERALLY TEETERING ON THE BREAK BRINK OF INSOLVENCY. THE STATE TAKEOVER -- POTENTIALLY LOOMING. THIS PAST FALL ARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION REJECTED OUR DISTRICTS BUDGET PLAN BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO RELATE TO ON GOING DEFICIT SPENDING. A FEW WEEKS LATER OUR STATE FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM VIC MATT. I REVIEWED THEIR DISTRICT INCLUDES AN ALSO CONCLUDED THE DISTRICT IS AT HIGH RISK -- FOR INSOLVENCY. AND ESSENTIALLY THEY FOUND THAT -- THE DISTRICT AND IS GOING TO RUN OUT OF CASH AND SO WE KNOW THAT WE WE KNOW THE DISTRICT IS ACTUALLY WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS THAT AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THEY'RE GOING TO IN THE NEAR FUTURE. BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION REMAINS IS IS HOW DO WE GET HERE WHAT CAN WE DO TO PREVENT THIS DISTRICT ANOTHER SIMILAR DISTRICTS. FOR IT FROM THESE ISSUES IN YOU KNOW FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE HERE I THINK THE ISSUE THAT REALLY MAKES MY CONSTITUENTS AND ME FRANKLY AND MY COLLEAGUES WHO REPRESENT THE SECRETARY UP SCRATCHED HER HEAD. IS THIS DISTRICT IS AT THE BRINK OF INSOLVENCY AT A TIME WHEN WE'VE INCREASED REVENUE FROM THE STATE BY 50%. 250% MORE MONEY FOR MY TAX DOLLARS GOING TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN MORE BROKE AND USUALLY HAVE DISTRICTS WHO ARE ABOUT TO GO BROKE WHEN WE'RE IN A RECESSION. WHEN THERE'S LESS MONEY GOING TO A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT RIGHT HERE -- THE IS IS REALLY -- AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW WE CAN PREVENT THIS FROM. EVER HAPPENING AGAIN. AND I WILL STE A STATE THAT -- THIS IS NOT THE ONLY DISTRICT THAT HAS GOING THROUGH TOUGH TIMES. THIRTY SIX UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA NOT ME DISTRICTS ARE AT THIS POINT WITH THICK MAT LITERALLY ON THE ON THE VERGE OF RUNNING OUT OF CASH AND SO -- YOU COULD PROBABLY HAVE THE SAME DISCUSSIONS FOR QUITE A FEW DISTRICTS AND SO WE DID LOOK AT LOOKING AT MULTIPLE DISTRICTS WE LOOK TALK TO THE AUDITOR STAFF WE FIGURED. HAVING A DEEP DIVE INTO ONE DISTRICT WILL CERTAINLY HELP US HERE IN SACRAMENTO HELP LEADERSHIP HELP THE SCHOOL BOARD HELP THE COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT HERE. AND TO PREVENT THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. I DID WANT TO KNOW TWO THERE WERE SOME EARLY QUESTIONS ON THIS AUDIT. AS FAR AS OVERLAP WITH EXISTING -- FINANCIAL ANALYSIS WE DID WORK WITH THE AUDIT TEAM AND WITH THICK MAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS AUDIT WOULD NOT. DUPLICATE EXISTING WORK BUT TAKE A DEEPER DIVE OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS BACK TO LOOK AT I'D BUDGET DECISIONS -- ACTIONS -- YOU KNOW FINANCIAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THE POINT TIME DECISIONS ARE LAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS TO TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE FINANCES OF OUR SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS A DISTRICT IS TRYING TO ACT RIGHT NOW IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO ADDRESS SOME OTHER BUDGET ISSUES SO I'M ASKING IF THE COMMITTEE ADOPTS US TODAY. THAT WE HAVE THE AUDIT START -- AFTER MAY FIRST TO ALLOW THEM TO TO TO WORK ON THEIR CURRENT BUDGET ISSUES AND NOT GETTING AWAY WITH WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO WITH ADOPTING THEIR THEIR BUDGET THIS -- THIS SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER -- SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION AND I I GUESS FOR ME TODAY TO SPEAK AS WELL PLEASE PROCEED [inaudible] OKAY. WHAT GOOD DAY EVERYONE A MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATE VAN BUREN I SERVED ON THE SACRAMENTO CITY EL CAP COMMITTEE? FOR TWO TERMS -- I'M CURRENTLY SERVING AS AN ARTS AND EDUCATION ADVISER TO THE DISTRICT. I'M HOMEOWNER A TAXPAYER. A STOCK STATE GRADUATE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M A PARENT OF THREE STUDENTS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SACRAMENTO CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT. MY SERVICE AS AN EL CAP REPRESENTATIVE. WE SPENT HOURS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE BUDGET. AS AN ADVOCATE FOR ARTS AND MUSIC EDUCATION I WAS PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON POTS OF MONEY. THAT WOULD BE USED TO HIRE AND TRAIN TEACHERS TO INTEGRATE THE ARTS INTO THEIR CURRICULUM. WHAT I FOUND WAS A VERY CONFUSING OPAQUE SYSTEM? THAT SEEMED DESIGNED TO OBFUSCATE ACTUAL REVENUE AND SPENDING. I HAVE REVIEWED THE FISCAL RISK ANALYSIS PUBLISHED BY THE FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM ON DECEMBER TWELFTH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THREE ITEMS POPPED OUT AT ME. ONE FEDERAL DOLLARS WERE LEFT ON SPENT AND WILL RETURN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WELL UNRESTRICTED MONEY RAN OUT LEAVING A DEFICIT. TWO THERE IS A SMALL GROUP IN THE BUSINESS OFFICE. OF THE DISTRICT TO ARE VIRTUALLY UNDER -- MAKING SPENDING AND HIRING DECISIONS WITHOUT CONSULTING A LARGER GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS. NUMBER. THREE EMPLOYEES MADE FUTURE BUDGETING DECISIONS BASED ON A ONE TIME INFLUX OF FUNDS EVEN THOUGH GOVERNOR BROWN INSTRUCTED THE SCHOOL DISTRICT NOT TO DO SO. THE DISTRICT WENT ON AN ADMINISTRATIVE HIRING SPREE. IT IS UNKNOWN OR IF OR HOW MUCH OF THIS MONEY ACTUALLY WENT INTO THE CLASSROOM. I SUPPORT THE REQUEST OF AN AUDIT STARTING MAY FIRST. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS REGARDINGWHICH POTS OF MONEY TO SPEND. ON STUDENTS AND PROGRAMS. WHO MADE THE DECISION TO HIRE NEW ADMINISTRATORS AND WHY? WERE THESE HIRES NECESSARY WHAT JOB CATEGORIES WERE NEWLY CREATED FOR THEM. WHO IMPROVE SALARY INCREASES ARE BONUSES FOR ADMINISTRATORS? WHAT QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING TO CURRENT FISCAL DECISION MAKERS ACTUALLY HAVE? WILL THESE EMPLOYEES BE INVOLVED IN FUTURE DECISION MAKING. OUR SCHOOLS ARE IN TROUBLE. I AM AN ADVOCATE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND I DO NOT WANT TO SEE A TAKEOVER. OF OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS BY THE UNDERSTANDING WHY WE LANDED IN THE SITUATION. IS TO UNDERGO A DETAILED BROAD AUDIT. OUTLINING WHO WHAT. WHEN AND WHY? WE MUST BE TRANSPARENT WE MUST HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. TAXPAYERS WHO FUND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS DESERVE TO KNOW HOW THEIR TAXES ARE BEING SPENT. AND FAMILIES DESERVE TO KNOW WHY FEDERAL DOLLARS WERE LEFT ON SPENT. PLEASE UPPORT AND IMPLEMENT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY'S REQUEST FOR AN AUDIT IMMEDIATELY WE HAVE LIMITED TIME TO RIGHT THE SHIP BUT I AM CONFIDENT WITH THE CORRECT TEAM ON BOARD. WE CAN RETAIN LOCAL CONTROL AND PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO THE PUBLIC THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS CRAIG POWELL AND I AM THE PRESIDENT. OF I ON SACRAMENTO WHICH IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG ORGANIZATION AND POLICY ADVISORY GROUP. IT'S BEEN IN OPERATION SACRAMENTO FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS DRILLING DEEP AS WE CAN INTO. INTO WHAT'S GOING ON AND UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND SO FORTH -- WE'RE RECENTLY MADE THE DECISION TO EXPAND AND CREATE A UNIT CALLED AYE ON SACRAMENTO SCHOOLS -- AND THE AND THE REAL TRIGGER FOR THAT HAS BEEN THIS FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH THIS SEGMENT A CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT. UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'M A RETIRED CORPORATE LAWYER I'M A FIFTH GENERATION SACRAMENTO THE THIRD GENERATION OF MY FAMILY SECOND GENERATION OF MY FAMILY OUT OF THREE TO GO THROUGH CITY SCHOOLS -- I ALSO SERVICE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SACRAMENTO TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. AND I WANT TO APPLAUD -- MEMBER MCCARTY FOR MAKING THIS REQUEST HE AND I HAVE NOT ALWAYS SEEN EYE TO EYE ON ISSUES -- HOWEVER FROM TIME TO TIME AND THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE AND WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT -- FOR HIS PRINCIPLED APPROACH TO TO LAW MAKING AND POLICY -- AND ALWAYS HAVE. THIS IS A DISTRICT THAT IS IN SEVERE CRISIS AND ITS CONSTITUTES THE BIGGEST SINGLE THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF SACRAMENTO. IS THE FAILURE OF THIS DISTRICT LET ME REPEAT THAT THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE FUTURE SACRAMENTO. AND ITS CHILDREN. SO THIS IS THE FIRE DRILL TIME FOLKS I AM SHOCKED THIS HASN'T BEEN DONE YEARS AGO -- AND AND REGULARLY DONE -- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH ISSUES AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES NOW LET AN EFFORT TO RECALL SCHOOL BOARD ABOUT TWO DECADES AGO IN AN EFFORT CO CHAIRED BY THEN. CITY COUNCIL MEMBER -- THE LATE SAMPLE NOW -- THAT EFFORT FELL SHORT. LED TO A A SLATE BEING PUT FORTH BY VAN SACRAMENTO MAYOR JOE SERNA AND AND PHIL ANGELIDES WHICH SUCCESSFULLY. TOSSED OUT A POORLY PERFORMING SCHOOL SCHOOL BOARD WHICH DID FRANKLY A VERY GOOD JOB FOR ABOUT A DECADE. AND THEN AND THEN THINGS WENT BAD. AND THEY'VE BEEN GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE -- PART OF THE PROBLEMS THE COLLAPSE OF LOCAL MEDIA THE BEE IS A SECOND TO BE IS A IS A SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF NOT ABLE. TO STAFF -- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH THREE REPORTERS LIKE IT DID IT ONE TIME -- SO WE'LL FORM AN ORGANIZATION TO TRY TO TRY THIS TO TO TO TO MAKE FILL UP FOR THAT VACUUM BUT WE DON'T HAVE SUBPOENA POWER. WE DON'T HAVE THE POWERS OF DISCOVERY WE DESPERATELY NEED -- AT A RESPECTED ORGANIZATION. EXAMINER TO REVIEW THIS TO COME UP WITH FINDINGS THAT THE PUBLIC CONTRAST. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE THAT THE PARTIES IN PLAY HERE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND THE TEACHERS UNION ARE LOBBING BOMBS ON ONE ANOTHER AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO TO TRUST. THE STATE AUDITOR HAS A STRONG REPUTATION REPUTATION OF BEING TRUSTED. SO WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WHEN THE FINDINGS OF THIS AUDIT COMES OUT. WHO ARE RUNNING FOR SCHOOL BOARD WILL BE ASK DO YOU SUPPORT THIS FINDING -- THIS RECOMMENDATION OF THE STATE AUDITOR OR PEOPLE WILL CREATE CANDIDATES WILL CREATE PLATFORMS WILL SAY WE ARE RUNNING ON A PLATFORM TO IMPLEMENT THE THINGS RECOMMENDED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. AND TO REFRAIN FROM THE THINGS. THAT SHE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING BEEN THIS DISTRICT. SO THIS IS THAT IMPORTANT THAT WE SEE SO -- WE WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT -- WE WE DO FEEL THAT THEY ARE A LOT OF COMMON ISSUES BETWEEN THIS GESTURE CAN A NUMBER AROUND THE STATE. MASSIVE VOEPEL BALL LIABILITIES SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR DISTRICT. TWELVE BILLION OR WHATEVER THEN LA AND THEIR NUMBER OF OTHERS AND THERE'S SOME UNIQUE ISSUES BUT I DO THINK THERE OBJECT LESSONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THIS. IN A DEEP DIVE BY THE HONOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY BRING WITNESSES TODAY THE SITE WILL MOVE TO PRESENTATION BY THE STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS MR MCCARTY INDICATED THIS WILL BE AN AUDIT OF SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE DO HAVE THE FIGMENT REPORT AND CERTAINLY WILL REVIEW THAT REPORT. WHAT MR MCCARTY INDICATED IS VIC MATT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FITMENT SICK MATT LOOKED AT ABOUT A FOURTEEN MONTH WINDOW WHAT MR MCCARTY IS ASKING US TO DO IS LOOK AT A FULL FIVE YEAR WINDOW? WHICH IS WHAT THE BUDGET OF THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT IS BASED ON SO WE WOULD LOOK AT REVENUES EXPENDITURES THEIR BUDGET PROJECT PROJECTIONS THEIR BUDGET PREPARATION FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. TO REALLY TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTIONS THAT TO THE DISTRICT TOOK OVER THOSE FIVE YEARS ORIN SOME CASES FAILED TO TAKE. A THAT WERE REALLY THE DRIVERS A PRIMARY CAUSE OF THEIR CURRENT FISCAL. SITUATION -- AS AS HIS WITNESSES INDICATED WE WOULD LOOK AT WHO MADE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS WHAT WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE OVER THAT TIME FRAME THAT AGAIN LED TO OUR CONTRIBUTED. TO THE SITUATION THAT THE DISTRICT FINDS ITSELF PROJECTIONS OF LOOKING AT THE REASONABLENESS OF THEIR BUDGET PROJECTIONS OVER THOSE FIVE YEARS -- WHAT ACTIONS IS THE DISTRICT TAKING OR INTENDING TO TAKE TO TRY TO RESOLVE -- THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION -- LOOKING AT AS I SAID THEIR BUDGETING PRACTICES THEIR FINANCIAL PRACTICES -- DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY COULD IMPROVE UPON -- AND DO A BETTER JOB OF PROJECTING AND THEN CERTAINLY -- TRACKING THEIR THEIR FINANCES HE SPECIFICALLY ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAS MADE MULTIPLE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DISTRICT MISS MCCARTY WANTS US. TO RELIEF DRILL DOWN AND FIGURE OUT OKAY WHICH OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED -- I HAVE THOSE ASSISTED IN IMPROVING THE DISTRICT IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED WHAT'S THE RATIONALE WHY IS THE DISTRICT NOT IMPLEMENTING THOSE PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE FOCUS OF THE DISTRICT AND MINIMIZING THE IMPACT ON STUDENTS OF THE SITUATION AT THE DISTRICT FINDS ITSELF AND SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING. TO MITIGATE ANY ADVERSE IMPACT ON STUDENTS AT SEX CITY UNIFIED -- THIS AUDIT IS RELATIVELY SMALL -- IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED HOURS -- SO WE AND AGAIN IF IF THE THE REQUESTED FOR US TO DELAY STARTING THIS AUDIT UNTIL MAY THAT'S EASILY DOABLE AS I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT. WE HAVE STAFF THAT CAN START AUDIT IN MARCH AND APRIL BUT AGAIN THERE ARE AT LEAST ONE AUDIT -- DOCTOR WEBBER'S AUDIT THAT WAS APPROVED WHERE WE COULD PUT A COUPLE OF TEAMS ON THAT PARTICULAR AUDIT -- AND HOMELESSNESS AUDIT AS WELL WHERE THAT'S A LARGE AUDIT WHERE WE'VE ASKED. BEEN ASKED TO GO TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DISTRICTS SO I CAN THROW A COUPLE OF TEAMS AT THAT AS WELL. AND THEN WHEN. IF THE COMMITTEE APPROVES THIS WE WILL HAVE STAFF AVAILABLE TO STARTED IN MAY IF THAT'S THE DESIRE OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU THANKS FOR PRESERVATION OF THIS TIME LET'S ASK IF THERE ARE ANY AFFECTED AGENCIES I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY -- IF YOU WOULD PLEASE CONTRAST HERE AT THE TABLE. PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS OKAY ELECT SUPERINTENDENT SEXY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- GOOD MORNING -- CHAIRMAN SALAS AND MEMBERS OF THIS JOINT COMMITTEE -- AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU THIS MORNING -- FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY YEARS OUR DISTRICT HAS BEEN SERVING SACRAMENTO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WITH QUALITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT PREPARE STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER. WE CURRENTLY SERVE OVER FORTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS AND WHERE THE THIRTEENTH LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE. WE'RE ALSO ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE AREA AND OVER INCOME ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. AS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE NEWS OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS HAD TO DISAPPROVE BUDGETS AND IS CURRENTLY AT RISK. OF STATE TAKEOVER IF WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN CUTS BY JUNE TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET. AS YOU KNOW STATE TAKEOVER WOULD HAVE MANY DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR SCHOOLS -- BUT I WANT TO GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES. SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD MEAN AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT LESS MONEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO SPEND ON OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE WE WOULD PAY MARKET RATE INTEREST ON A STATE LAW ON THAT WOULD BE ISSUE TO US. AND APPOINTED ADMINISTRATOR WOULD TAKE OVER AND LOCAL CONTROL WOULD BE LOST. I SHOWN ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE IN OTHER EXAMPLES RECOVERY COULD TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS. AND OVERALL EXPERTS AGREE THAT A STATE TAKEOVER IS BAD FOR STUDENTS. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE'VE UNDERGONE FOR FINANCIAL REVIEWS AND THESE HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING AREAS OF FOCUS FOR US. THEY INCLUDE LAST FALL THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION APPOINTED A FISCAL ADVISER THAT IS IN OUR DISTRICT CURRENTLY. HAS BEEN STATION INSIDE AND IS WORKING WITH DISTRICT OFFICES TO REVIEW THE WORK OF OUR BUDGET TEAM AND BUSINESS SERVICES DEPARTMENT. THANK MATT COMPLETED A FISCAL HEALTH ANALYSIS AND ISSUED A REPORT IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AN AUDITING FIRM CHRO L. L. P. COMPLETED AND PRESENTED AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF OUR DISTRICT AND PRESENTED THEIR FINDINGS IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CONDUCTED A FEDERAL. PROGRAM MONITORING REVIEW TO ENSURE DISTRICT IS PROPERLY SPENDING FEDERAL FUNDS. NOW BASED ON THE WORK OF THESE FOR INDEPENDENT ENTITIES WHO CONDUCTED REVIEWS OF OUR DISTRICT ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO OUR DISTRICTS BUDGET CHALLENGES STEMMING FROM OUR COSTS. EXCEEDING OUR REVENUES. AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE FOR OUR DISTRICT MY CURRENT PRIORITY IS TO ENSURE THAT IN THE COMING MONTHS. MY STAFF ARE 1100% DEDICATED TO DOING THE WORK NECESSARY TO AVOID A STATE TAKEOVER. WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT ANY DISTRACTION TAKING US AWAY FROM DOING THEWORK OF SAVING OUR SCHOOLS PUTS US AT EVEN GREATER RISK OF A TAKEOVER. I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE REQUESTED STATE AUDIT FOR DISTRICT AND I DON'T OBJECT TO THE INTENT. BACK I WOULD ASK THAT THE REVIEW OF THE OUGHT TO GO BEYOND THE PROPOSED THREE TO FIVE YEAR PERIODI'VE BEEN SUPERINTENDENT FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS. BUT WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON THE TIMING OF THE AUDIT. AND I WOULD ASK THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. WORK TO IDENTIFY A REASONABLE TIME LYING TO CONDUCT THE AUDIT. AND AT THAT TIME LINE INVOLVED STARTING IT AT THE END OF JUNE ONCE WE SUBMIT A BALANCED BUDGET AND SAVE OUR DISTRICT. I SAY THIS BECAUSE IN MY LAST POST AT FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I OVERSAW AN AUDIT BY THE STATE AUDITOR AND CAN SPEAK TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO AFFECTED WE FOCUS ON OUR CURRENT CHALLENGES. ONE CLOSE BY SHARING THAT SAVING OUR SCHOOLS IS DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME OUTSIDE OF HAVING THE HONOR OF SERVING A SUPERINTENDENT I'M THE PARENT OF FOUR CHILDREN AND SEXY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT RANGING. FROM FOURTH GRADE ALL THE WAY TO A TWELFTH GRADE. AND MY EXPECTATION IS THAT WE WILL SAVE OUR SCHOOLS AND THAT I WILL SEE MY CURRENT FOURTH GRADER GRADUATE WITH THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN I'M COMMITTED TO FINDING BUDGET SOLUTIONS THAT SERVE OUR STUDENTS TODAY AND FOR YEARS TO COME AND ASK THAT YOU PLEASE WORK WITH ME. AND MY TEAM TO IDENTIFY A REASONABLE TIME LINE FOR THIS AUDIT. THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STATE AGENCIES THAT WOULD WISH TO COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. HEARING AND SEEING NINE LET ME TURN IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE DíAS FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS LET ME ASK A QUICK QUESTION OF SOMEONE MEMBER MCCARTY. I GIVE THE TESTIMONY I BELIEVE YOU. TO HAVING THE AUDIT REQUEST -- AFTER ME SO [inaudible] THE CORRECT. YEAH WELL THE THE REQUEST WAS TO HAVE IT START IMMEDIATELY UPON THE VOTE TODAY AND WE SAT DOWN WITH THE AUDIT TEAM AND WITH THE DISTRICT THIS WEEK AND WE THOUGHT A FAIR. MIDDLE GROUND WAS MAY FIRST -- THEY LOOTED THAT THE FIRST -- FEW WEEKS ARE GETTING SEA LEGS GOING IN. MAKING THE REQUEST BACK AND FORTH MEETING WITH THE DEPARTMENT SO -- IN REALITY MAY FIRST WHAT WE BELIEVE -- ACHIEVE THE THE DESIRES OF THE DISTRICTS TO NOT GET IN THE WAY WHICH I DON'T WANT NOT -- TO DISMISS THEIR DEAR DOING TOUGH WORK RIGHT NOW AND DOING MADE YEAR CUTS TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GO INTO RECEIVER SIT RECEIVERSHIP SO. I THINK THE MAY FIRST DATE WILL ALLOW US TO TO TO GET TO THAT POINT. OKAY AS ONE OF THAT CLEAR CLARITY FOR TACKLING A BIG ISSUE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THE HEADLINES -- RECENTLY ABOUT SEC UNIFIED BUT WE KNOW THAT THOSE CARRY ON OTHER DISTRICTS AS WELL IN TERMS OF TRYING TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET WITH THAT IDEA WE HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE DíAS. SENATE ROTH DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. FOR YOU [inaudible] OKAY. ADDITIONAL ALL CENTER BOARD JUST IN THE HOME OF TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON. THANK YOU I I TO JUST WANTED SOME CLARIFICATION I HAVE A REAL SOFT SPOT FOR FOLKS THAT WANT TO GET INFORMATION -- I THINK IS POLICY MAKERS -- WE SHOULD HAVE -- ACCESS TO AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE -- BUT DID I HEAR YOU EARLIER MENTIONED THAT -- IF THE DRUG DRASTIC CHANGES ARE DONE THAT THAT -- THE DISTRICT GO BANKRUPT AND WHAT MONTH WAS OUR OUR CURRENT CASH FLOW -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS -- PREDICTING THAT WE WOULD BE RUNNING OUT OF CASH IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OF COURSE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY JUST MENTIONED WE ARE MAKING CUTS NOW WE'VE STARTED TO MAKE CUTS ALL THIS PAST YEAR -- TO EXTEND THAT DEADLINE -- AND INTO THE BUDGET ADOPTION ADOPTION PROCESS IN JUNE -- SO THAT ALL OF THOSE CHANGES WILL REFLECT A DELAY. IN THAT DATE SO ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT IN AUDIT WOULD YIELD INFORMATION THAT'S NOT ALREADY PROVIDED BY THE FOR ENTITIES WHO HAVE PROVIDED OVERSIGHT ON THIS MATTER PRIOR. WELL. AS I SAID I SUPPORT THE INTENSE WHICH IS TO LOOK DEEPER AT BUSINESS PROCESS SEES IT CETERA THAT MIGHT. MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. I WAS SIMPLY STATING THAT OUR FOCUS IS ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR WORK RESULTS IN A BALANCED BUDGET SO THAT WE DO NOT RUN OUT OF CASH BY NOVEMBER -- AND WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE STATE AUDITOR TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY FINDINGS BEYOND THAT FOR THE LONG TERM ARE IMPLEMENTED. PERHAPS WE COULD ASK THE AUTHOR IN THE AUDITOR -- THE SCOPE OF THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND WHAT THINK MATT DATED MAYBE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE DISCOVERS WE ANTICIPATE. CHANTING WELL THERE IT THERE ARE TWO HURDLES ONE WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE THE EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW. BUT EVEN DO THAT THE WORD THE MARGINS ARE SUPER STAND SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE DISTRICT GOING FORWARD. WHAT HAPPENED HOW YOU FOR THIS IN THE FUTURE -- Là THEORIES OUT THERE -- ONGOING EXPENDITURES ONE TIME MONEY TOO MUCH ADMINISTRATION EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS WE COULDN'T AFFORD LOT OF BLOAT FEDERAL MONEY LEFT ON THE TABLE SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ALL THESE THINGS AND OF THE THE THE THICK MAT THE EXISTING ON ITS FOCUS WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS LOOK OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. IT IS WE CAN TAKE A STEP BACK AND SO THE SUPERINTENDENT THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY CAN REALLY HAVE A BUT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AS FAR AS HOW WE GOT HERE BECAUSE THIS. WATER LAS STRAP DISTRICTS THIS IS ABNORMAL ALIVE DISTRICTS HAVE THE SAME POPULATIONS THE SAME DEMOGRAPHICS RIGHT AROUND THIS AREA AND THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO RUN OUT OF CASH IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AND SO. YOU KNOW THIS HAS A SHORT TERM -- ISSUE THAT THEY'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM PICTURE AS WELL. SO THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS. AND COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION -- VIA. YES IT WAS WE WROTE THE AUDIT REQUEST WITH THAT ONE QUESTION MARK WE DIDN'T WANT TO DUPLICATE WORK AND SO THERE IS THIS OUT GETTING IN THE WEEDS TOO MUCH. THERE'S A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IN THIS GROUP CALLED FIX MATT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM KIND OF BY THE STATE TO DEPARTMENT OF THAT. WHICH HAS BEEN DOING SOME ANALYSIS ON WHERE THEY'RE AT TODAY LIKE THE CASTLE ISSUE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. TODAY AND TOMORROW THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND SO WE DID WE DIDN'T WANT TO DUPLICATE THAT SO THIS AUDIT THAT WE CRAFTED. GOES WELL BEYOND THAT GEN. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON PLACE. DO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SUPPORT THE AUDIT IF THE DATE WAS MOVED INTO JUNE OR AT THE END OF YOUR BUDGET. ACT AND YOU OPPOSE THE AUDIT IF IT IS IN MAY. WELL WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT I WORK WITH -- THE STATE AUDITOR -- SO THAT -- WE ARE EXCLUSIVELY ON PASSING A BALANCED BUDGET AT THE END OF JUNE -- SO IF THAT REQUIRES -- BEGINNING TO DO SOME INTERACTION SOME -- GATHERING OF INFORMATION. I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR STAFF'S TIME IS DEDICATED TO THE AUDIT AFTER WE PASS A BALANCED BUDGET. I MEAN I WOULD. I AGAIN I I THINK I'M GONNA ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF UNDER BORDERS. I REALLY THINK THAT THIS ORDER IS FIRST RATE AND HAS A FANTASTIC REPUTATION. AND WHEN WE PLACE THESE KINDS OF DIFFICULT MATTERS IN THE HANDS OF THE AUDITOR. HER TRACK RECORD HAS BEEN. TO FIND OUT THE INFORMATION NECESSARY AND TO REALLY GET TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION. THAT YOU MENTIONED -- THAT I GUESS YOU HAD A PERIOD OF TIME IT FRESNO UNIFIED AND OUT -- I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT -- GIVEN SOME OF THE CAN OF US IN. FRESNO CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT FRESNO. UNIFIED THAT THERE IS I THINK A SIGNIFICANT QUESTION ABOUT. THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND HOW IT GOT INTO THIS MESS. AND IF THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL OVERLAY. WELL TOUGH -- SO I'M GOING TO I WAS INTENDING TO EITHER NOT VOTE ON THIS. BECAUSE OF THE DUPLICATION AND BEAT BUT QUITE FRANKLY I THINK YOU GOT TO GET DOWN TO TO TO HOW DID THIS HAPPEN GO BACK DEEP INTO IT -- IF IT GETS THAT IF IF IT GETS A LITTLE BIT ON THE WAY FROM. MAY I THINK THIS AUDITOR HAS THE SENSITIVITY IN THE PROFESSIONALISM -- TO MOVE IT FORWARD WITHOUT GETTING IT IN THE WAY. AND JUST A LITTLE. POINT OF CONCERN HERE BASED ON THE FRESNO EXPERIENCE. WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FAILURE TO UTILIZE FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S A BIG QUESTION THAT THAT HAS TO HAVE SOME ANSWERS NUMBER. ONE AND NUMBER TWO YES THERE WERE CONTRACTS I GUESS IN THE THICK MAT THAT SAID QUOTE UNQUOTE ON AFFORDABLE. BUT I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE PROCESSES OF HIRING ADMINISTRATORS BULKING UP THAT THAT THE TOP END WHILE -- THE SCHOOL -- AT THE DESK IN FOR STUDENTS. IT BEGINS TO BE UPSIDE DOWN SO I'VE I'VE SENT TO CHANGE MY MIND I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS AUDIT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET IN THE WAY. AND I THINK YOU BETTER DO SOME REAL SERIOUS WORK BETWEEN. NOW AND I GUESS IN IN JUNE FOR THE SAKE OF THE KIDS THAT YOU. REPRESENT -- AND SO I'M GONNA BUT I ON THIS -- MORLOCK. THANK YOU RICHARD I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT LISTENING TO THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION I'M ON ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT'S LOOKING AT THE FUTURE THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SO WE APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU ARE HERE THANK ARE NOT PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER CHAIR I SERVED ON THE FOR THE BY PRIOR YEARS SAID THIS ROLE ON THE SENATE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW. TWENTY SEVEN ONE WHICH OVERSEES EDUCATION. AND SO I SPENT SOME TIME. YOU KNOW GETTING INTO THIS ROLE -- BUT LAST YEAR WE DECIDED TO GET. ALL THE KAFIRS THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS FOR ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND JUST SEE WHAT WE COULD FIND THEY'RE NOT EASY TO GET MISTER CHAIR THE NOT ALWAYS ON THE WEBSITE SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BUT IN OUR ROLE AS LEGISLATORS WE NEED. TO LOOK AT DETAILS LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MANAGE SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T MEASURE IT. SO WE TOOK ALL THE COMPREHENSIVE IN YOUR MIND ONE NUMBER THAT WAS THAN. THE NET UNRESTRICTED POSITION IT SHOULD BE NET ASSETS BUT FOR TWO THIRDS IT WAS. NET DEFICIT. AND SO -- WE HAVE. SOME SERIOUS ISSUES FACING. THIS LEGISLATURE I BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE. AND AND AND IF THE OUT OF THE NINE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR SACRAMENTO CITY PLACED -- EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN IT'S IT'S NEAR THE BOTTOM. THAT'S BY TAKING THEIR UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT AND DIVIDING IT BY THEIR POPULATION. WE DID THE DID THAT FOR ALL THE DISTRICT INCLUDING LA UNIFIED PRESS TRY TO SEE WERE BEING EVERYONE IS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SACRAMENTO CITY. AND YOU JUST LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT OF THE UNRESTRICTED THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. PLACE THEM SIX FROM THE BOTTOM THEY'RE JUST ABOVE FRESNO. L. A. U. S. D. SAN DIEGO U. S. D. SAN FRANCISCO UST AND LONG BEACH UST. SO WE HAVE A DISTRICT LIKE LA UNIFIED WHICH JUST CAME OUT WITH THEIR COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR JUNE. THIRTY EIGHTEEN THEY HAD TO PUT ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] OF UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS. THAT'S MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. SO WE'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS ISSUES WE CAN LOOK. AT ONE DISTRICT AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN LOOKED AT BY VIC MATT. OBVIOUSLY BUT BUT WE HAVE A SYSTEMIC ISSUE THAT WILL BE FACING ALL OF US. AS IF FIX MATT HAS TO MAKE LOANS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND WE'RE TALKING LA UNIFIED IF WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM A TEN BILLION DOLLAR LOAN. I DON'T KNOW OR WE FIND THAT MONEY. WE JUST KIND OF WIPED OUT ALREADY THE BAND AND UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT WE HAVEN'T EVEN SET ASIDE A DOLLAR FOR THE READY THEY FUND FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF OUT MISTER CHAIR I I I WOULD HOPE THIS IS A POSITIVE THING THAT IS IN A STALLING THING -- BECAUSE THESE ISSUES ARE VERY CRITICAL AND AND THEY WILL BE KNOCKING AT YOUR BECAUSE THE CAPPERS FOR JUNE THIRD. INCLUDED IN AND SOME OF THESE NUMBERS. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THEM YET IT'S IT'S IT'S MARCH. AND WE'VE GOT CPA'S PROBABLY WAITING FOR ACTUARIAL REPORTS BUT BUSH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN DECEMBER SO WE'RE WE'RE FINDING. REAL ON DELAYS IN IN THIS INFORMATION BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ITEM IN BUT IT BUT WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT ONE WE GOT NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. PROVIDERS ARE VAST -- BALLS ON ON TO THE OTHERS TO HELP US HELP THEM. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SIR MORE LIKE FOR SHOULD THOSE COMMENTS WE KNOW THAT -- THIS AUDIT REQUEST EVEN THOUGH WE'RE LOOKING ONLY AT SACRAMENTO UNIFIED -- DOES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE AND SO -- WILL BE LOOKING FOR TO THE RESULTS SHOULD DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT DEFINITELY. YOUR NOTE SIR ARE WELL TAKEN. OKAY AT THIS TIME WE ASK IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THIS HOW. IF THIS AUDIT IS IS APPROVED -- DOES IT IN ANY WAY -- STOP OR HINDER. THE STATE. FROM TAKING OVER THIS LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IF BY NOVEMBER OF OF THIS YEAR THE OUT OF MONEY MEANING. IF IF THE SUPERINTENDENT CANNOT MAKE ENOUGH CUT. BYE BY NOVEMBER AND IT GOES INTO INSOLVENCY WILL YOUR AUDIT AT THAT TIME -- HINDER THE STATE AND THINKING THIS OVER. NO OUR AUDIT WOULDN'T HINDER ANY CALIFORNIANS CERTAINLY LEGISLATURE -- DECIDES WITH RESPECT TO SEX CITY UNIFIED WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO IF WE IF IT'S APPROVED AND WHERE. WITH A MAY FIRST START DATE -- WE WILL BE SENSITIVE AS WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST TWO ENTITIES THAT ARE IN THE MIDST OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH THEIR BUDGET. SITUATION AND TRYING TO MAKE CUTS AND ONE THING THAT MY OFFICE CAN DO IS AS MR MCCARTY INDICATED HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT FIVE YEARS. SO WE CAN START BY LOOKING FIVE YEARS AGO GIVE US YOUR BUDGET YOUR KAFIRS FROM A FEW YEARS AGO AND STAFF CAN BE DOING ANALYSIS ON THAT WORK. AND NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THAT THE DISTRICT IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO STAGE OUR WORK SO TO SPEAK -- TO AVOID ANY INTERFERENCE WITH WHAT THE DISTRICT IS ATTEMPTING TO DO AT THIS TIME -- BUT MR DEEP THERE. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OUR AUDITS WOULD NOT HAVE ANY -- NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS ON ANY FUTURE DECISIONS RELATED TO THE DISTRICT AS FAR AS THE DISTRICT BEING TAKEN OVER IF IT IN FACT ENDS UP BEING INSOLVENT LATER THIS YEAR. EARLIER YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT -- IT WOULD. HOW LONG IS THAT IN TERMS OF LIKE WEEKS AND MONTHS A TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED OUR AUDIT WILL TAKE US ABOUT SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE? BASED ON A A TYPICAL AUDIT TEAM NOW ONE THING WE WILL DO AND THE SENATE OR BOARD JUST ASK THE QUESTION. SOME OF THE AUDITS THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT REFERRED -- TO OUR AUDITS OF PROBABLY THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE I THINK HE MENTIONED CROW THEY'RE ISSUING AN AUDIT -- OR AN OPINION ESSENTIALLY ON THE DISTRICTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- FOR SIX SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEY ISSUED THAT THAT OUGHT SO THAT'S A ONE YEAR LOOK THE FEDERAL COMPLIANCE WORK THAT HE REFERRED TO THAT'S TYPICALLY LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT YEAR. USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND MAKING SURE THAT THE THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY LOOK AT WHY WAS THERE FEDERAL MONEY LEFT ON THE TABLE WHY WAS THERE FEDERAL MONEY RESEARCH RETURN BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE WORK THAT MR MCCARTY IS ASKING US TO DO THAT ARE VERY SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM WHAT HAS CURRENTLY BEEN DONE. BY SOME OF THE ENTITIES A SUPERINTENDENT MENTIONED AND I THINK ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IS LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW AND AGAIN WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ALLOW THE DISTRICT TO CONDUCT. THE WORK IT NEEDS TO DO TRY TO RIGHT THE SHIP IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS -- AND WE CAN START BY LOOKING AT PRIOR YEARS -- SO THAT WE WE DO ALLOW THE THEY NEED TO MAKE. HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS QUESTIONS MEMBERS HAD THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND SENSITIVITY AROUND -- THE MAY FIRST JUNE BUDGET -- DEADLINE DISCUSSIONS INSIDE THAT'S TIME WE ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE ON THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] HEARING AND SEEING NONE WE WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU COULD PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES OR LESS WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

ONE ZERO TWO DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATOR PROGRAM -- THIS RUBIO WHEN YOU ARE READY TO BEGIN PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER TERM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS AUDIT HERE TODAY. I AM -- PROPOSING DECIDED BECAUSE THERE IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION THE D. WC. HAS MISMANAGED A VITAL QUALIFIED MEDICALLY GRAHAM. THIS MISMANAGEMENT HAS CAUSED HARM TO CALIFORNIA'S INJURED WORKERS EMPLOYERS AND PHYSICIANS. THE PLUMMETING NUMBER OF Q. ENEMIES IN THE FACE OF SURGING DEMAND HAS RESULTED IN UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN INJURED WORKERS BEING SEEN BY TWO I MEAN. Q. M. E. PHYSICIANS THIS MEANS LONGER WAITS FOR INJURED WORKERS ODD TO HAVE THEIR CLAIMS ADJUDICATED RESULTING IN MORE COST AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY FOR EMPLOYERS AND INEFFICIENCIES. FOR THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. A D. W. C.'S MISMANAGEMENT HAS OCCURRED IN TWO CRITICAL WAYS BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THE LACK OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION -- WAS ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND HAVING THESE DELAYS ALSO AFFECTS. EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS MORNING BUT THE FIRST THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS D. W. C. HAS FAILED TO REVISE THE FEE SCHEDULE UNDER WHICH YOU ARE ME PHYSICIANS ARE REIMBURSED FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS. THE WC IS REQUIRED UNDER LABOR CODE FIVE THREE ZERO SEVEN POINT SIX TWO REGULARLY REVISED SECURE ME FEE SCHEDULE YET THAT HAS NOT DONE SO SINCE THE IPHONE WAS INVENTED. THE LAST TIME THE FEE SCHEDULE WAS REVISED WAS TWO THOUSAND AND SIX JEREMY DOCTORS HAVE. BEEN LEAVING THE SYSTEM FOR YEARS AS THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WORKING FOR TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WAGES. D. W. C.'S FAILURE TO REGULARLY REVISED TWO ENEMIES. REIMBURSEMENTS AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION HAS DECIMATED THE QUEUE IN A SYSTEM WHEREAS THERE WERE OVER FOUR THOUSAND Q. AMY PHYSICIANS PERFORMING THESE IMPORTANT EVALUATIONS WHEN THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THERE ARE NOW APPROXIMATELY ONLY. TWO THOUSAND SO WE WENT FROM FOUR THOUSAND DOWN TO TWO THOUSAND DURING THE TIME DURING THIS TIME FRAME THE DEMAND FOR CURING ME PHYSICIANS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED FROM -- SIXTY THOUSAND PANEL REQUESTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX TO OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN ADDITION BEGINNING IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN D. W. C. BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS WHICH RESULTED IN TWC'S THIS MISSING HUNDREDS OF CURE ME PHYSICIANS FROM THE PROGRAM ON THE BASIS OF DO D. W. C.'S FALSE ALLEGATIONS. OF OVERBILLING AND THE REASON ARE IN THE RESULT IN LITIGATION A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE IN LOS ANGELES FOUND THE D. WC WAS ENGAGING IN UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS AND WAS DEPRIVING Q. AMY PHYSICIANS OF THEIR DUE PROCESS. RIGHT TO A HEARING SINCE THE LAWSUIT D. W. C. HAS CONTINUED TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE. TO MANUFACTURE FALLS FINDINGS OF OVERBUILDING AGAINST YOU AND ME PHYSICIANS. THIS AUDIT THIS AUDIT IS TIMELY AND VALUABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSES OF ON GOING BECAUSE OF D. W. C.'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE KI&lt;c.cyan&gt; JOIN&lt;/c&gt; ME PROGRAM. I HOPE TO LEARN WHERE THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG FOR SO LONG WITH THE Q. AMY PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN QUICKLY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THESE ROOT CAUSES. FIXING THE QUEUE ANY PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE RAPID BENEFIT FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM [inaudible] THANK AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. RIGHT SOMEONE EVER AGREED YOU HAVE WITNESSES. AT THIS TIME WE MOVED HERE WITNESSES AND AND SUPPORT THANKS -- GOOD MORNING THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME NECKLACE ROXBOROUGH AND I'M WITH THE LAW FIRM OF ROCKS FOR APARTMENTS NINE AGE RUNNING LOS ANGELES. ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO MENTIONED. THE LAWSUIT -- THAT OCCURRED THEY WERE IN FACT TO RETURN MAN DAMOS WHICH ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL LEGAL PLEADINGS. THEY AROSE BECAUSE MY OFFICE RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS FROM HIGHLY. HIGHLY QUALIFIED Q. ARMIES I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WERE. SHARES. OF ORTHOPEDICS CHAIR CHAIRS OF THE HEART SURGERY ORGANIZATIONS AFFAIRS HOSPITALS WHO ARE BEING THREATENED. BY FOLKS OF THE D. W. SAY. AND WE LOOKED INTO THAT. AND AFTER A COUPLE MONTHS DETERMINED THAT THE HEY THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT HAD BEEN VIOLATED [inaudible] REGULATIONS. HAVE BEEN PASSED WITH OUT GOING THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS. I MET WITH THE D. WC I MET WITH THE D. I. R.. OR ATTEMPTED TO MEET AND TALK TO THEM AND I SAID YOU FOLKS FOR ENGAGE IN UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS. THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE SO SO LAWSUITS WERE FILED. AND WE PREVAILED. AND WE PREVAILED ON TWO VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES WHICH IS WHY THIS AUDIT IS SO IMPORTANT. THE Q. ARMIES ARE SORT OF THE THAT THE THE SPOKE IN THE WHEEL OF WORKERS COMP. WHEN INJURED WORKERS THERE'S A DISPUTE AS TO THE NATURE EXTENT OF THEIR INJURY YOU GET QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINERS TO DETERMINE A CONTESTED ISSUE? WITH Q. ARMIES LEAVING THE SYSTEM WHICH IS WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS GOING ON WITH ORTHOPEDICS LEAVING THE SYSTEM AND SO ON WE ARE ASKED TO BRING AN INJECTION BECAUSE WHAT THE CUBANS WERE APPLYING FOR RE APPOINTMENTS THEY WERE BEING DENIED HEARINGS. I READ THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTORS MARCH FIRST LETTER TO THE CHAIR. AND MR PIERCE SOTO WHO IS NOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR -- IDENTIFIED AN APPEAL PROCESS IN THAT LETTER. JUDGE CHAO FAN OUT IN A FEBRUARY SIXTH AND I HAVE RECORDS OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD WANT. THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE FEBRUARY SIXTH HEARING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HE SAID TO THE WC I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINERS WAIT SIX AND EIGHT MONTHS WHICH HAVE BEEN THE CASE. THEN NOT GIVE MANY HEARING DATES. THEN SAY IT'S GONNA TAKE FORM MORE MONTHS TO GET A HEARING AND WHO KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET A RULING. AND SO HE ORDERED THEM TO GIVE US HEARINGS. AT THE SAME TIME IT WASN'T JUST THE OPINION OF OUR LAW FIRM BUT WAS THE OPINION OF JUDGE CHAO FOUGHT. ONE OF THE PREMIUM -- JUDGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON RENTS WHO SAID IN MY OPINION THESE ARE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS AND YOU FOLKS ARE IN TROUBLE. IT WAS AFTER THAT OCCURRED THAT THE D. WC MATT. WE HIRED A MEDIATOR AND WE SETTLE. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU FOLKS THAT. THE Q. AMIS. AT A GERMAN FROM HARPER UCLA. THEY HAD TO HIRE ME AND PAY ME A FORTUNE TO DEFEND. AND ALSO PREVENT BEING TURNED OVER FOR THE MEDICAL LICENSING BOARD BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T FOLLOWING WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE. UNDERGROUND BILLING REGULATIONS. AND SO THIS AUDIT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER SORT OF BACK THE CURTAIN BUT THE D. W. C.. AND FIND OUT WHO'S REALLY BEEN PULLING STRINGS BECAUSE THE UNDERGROUND RIGHT REGULATIONS. CONTINUE TO THIS DAY. SHORTLY AFTER THE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS WERE WITHDRAWN THE D. W. C. WITHIN A WEEK CAME OUT WITH NEW REGULATIONS. FIVE HUNDRED PAGES. FIVE HUNDRED PAGES OF OPPOSITION WERE FILE. AND THEY WERE WITHDRAWN. THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR WHO I DON'T BELIEVE WAS THE MYSTERY DIRECTOR AT THE TIME APPEARED IN FRONT SHE SAID AND WAS. WAS TOLD BY AND SHE WAIT TO HAVE STAKEHOLDER MEETS AND COME UP WITH. REGULATIONS THAT ARE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TO THE INJURED WORKER IN THE QUEUE AMIS. WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT. BUT ONE THING THAT THAT I WAS HAPPY TO NOTICE THERE'S NO DISPUTE AS TO WHY THIS AUDIT SHOULD TAKE PLACE AND THERE'S NO DISPUTE. THAT AN AUDIT SHOULD TAKE PLACE BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR AT THE END OF HIS LETTER HAS SAID. HE WILL FULLY COMPLY AND COOPER AND ANY REVIEW AND THE ONLY THING HE ****. IF THIS COMMITTEE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE AUDITOR. LOOK AT FRAUD ON THE QB'S PART WHICH PERSONALLY. NO OBJECTION TO BECAUSE IF THERE IS FRAUD AND CUMAE SYSTEM. ABSOLUTELY THAT CAN BE PART OF THE AUDIT. BUT IT IS UNDERSTOOD IT IS UNCONTESTED. BY EVEN ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR BECAUSE HE SAYS HE WILL FULLY COOPERATE. SO LET'S GET THIS AUDIT LET'S FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON BECAUSE I SERVE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. I HARDLY GOT ANYTHING AND NOW I SEE IN THE IN THE LETTER OF MARCH FIRST THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF EMAILS. LASTLY VERY QUICKLY. WHEN THE BILLING? DEMANDS WERE MADE OF MY CLIENTS THE DOCTORS. MY DOCTORS HAVE A CHOICE PAY ROCKS WERE A BUNCH OF MONEY. OR CUT A DEAL MOST SOMEONE DECIDE TO CUT A DEAL DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY GOES. IT DOESN'T GO TO THE D. WC OR THE AGENCY THE COAST FOR THE CARRIERS. SO THE D. WC WHO BY THE WAY HIRED INTERNALLY AND PUT SIX LAWYERS ON THE CASE AGAINST MY CURE THE DOCTOR SIX LAWYERS. THEY'RE DOING THE COLLECTION WORK FOR THE CARRIER INDUSTRY WHO BY THE WAY PAID THE BILLS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION. SO THE AUDIT WOULD REALLY HELP GET SOME TRANSPARENCY IN SOME -- SOME CLARITY HELP BRING REALLY GOOD ORTHOPEDIC DOCTORS BACK INTO THE SYSTEM WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE HARASSED. AUDITED. AND CHASTISE. FOR NOT DOING SOMETHING TECHNICALLY CORRECT WHEN THEY CAN BE IN THE PRIVATE FIELD AND THE INJURED WORKERS DEFINITELY DEFINITELY NEED THEM SO THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I ASK. THAT THE OUGHT TO BE APPROVED AND I THINK THE SYMBOL LINK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES I'M SORRY WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION AND WILL MOVE TO THE AGENCY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF. AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO INDICATED CHRIS COMPENSATION LOOKING AT THE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATOR PROGRAM AND BASICALLY SHE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW IDENTIFY HOW MANY Q. AMIS HAVE BEEN. REGISTERED THROUGH THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION AND HOW WHAT IS THAT TREND LOOK LIKE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- AND COMPARE THAT TO THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR THESE CALL. HE'S QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINERS TO CONDUCT ANALYSES -- OF INJURED WORKERS AND THEN IDENTIFY IF THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE WHICH IT APPEARS THERE HAS BEEN BASED ON SOME OF THE INFORMATION WE'VE SEEN WHAT IS A DIVISION DOING. TO TRY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF Q. EMMYS AVAILABLE TO CONDUCT THESE TYPES OF ANALYSES AND THEN TO PARTICULAR AREAS LOOKING UP THE PROCESS FOR APPOINTING OR RE APPOINTING AN INDIVIDUAL AS A CUE I ME. THERE'S AN INITIAL APPOINTMENT AND THEN THEY HAVE TO RENEW AND GET REAPPOINTED I THINK IT'S AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT BUT THE MEMBER IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT THAT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE IT COMPLIES WITH LAWS. REGULATIONS AT CENTER AND THEN IN THE EVENT AN INDIVIDUAL'S DENIED APPOINTMENT A REAPPOINTMENT ASKING US TO LOOK AT THE APPEALS PROCESS AND ARE THE QUEUE A MAYES OR THE CANDIDATES -- BEING GIVEN DUE PROCESS AS FAR AS IS THE DIVISION COMPLYING AGAIN WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO AN APPEAL OR A COMPLAINT FILED BY. BY A QUEUE IN ME SO ASKING US TO LOOK AT A SAMPLE OF APPEALS. ALSO AS SHE INDICATED SHE WANTS US TO LOOK AT THE FEE SCHEDULE WHEN WAS THE FEE SCHEDULE FIRST ESTABLISHED HAS IT BEEN UPDATED HOT WHAT PROCESS DO THEY GO THROUGH TO DETERMINE THEY BEING THE DIVISION. GO THROUGH TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE THE END AND A PRO QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINER FOR THEIR SERVICES -- AND THEN ALSO ASKING US TO LOOK AT THE DIVISION IS THE DIVISION IS CONDUCTING AUDITS OF Q. AMIS -- POWER THEY PRIORITIZING THEIR DECISION MAKING AS FAR AS WHICH AUDITS TO CONDUCT WHICH INDIVIDUALS TO AUDIT WHAT WHAT CLAIMS TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND THEN AS MAYES RUBIO AND AND HER WITNESS INDICATED LOOKING AT SOME OF THE COLLECTIONS. THAT THE DIVISION HAS MADE -- ASSERTIVELY ARE ALLEGEDLY ON BEHALF OF THE INSURANCE CARRIER SO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE FUNDING A RELATED -- TO THE QUEUE AT MAYES AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE AUDIT IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOURS IT WOULD TAKE US ABOUT SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU THIS TIME -- MOVED TO THE AFFECTED STATE AGENCIES I BELIEVE WE HAVE A COUPLE HERE TODAY. SO VEGAS CAN APPROACH THE MICROPHONE IDENTIFY YOURSELVES WHICH AGENCY OR WITH WE APPRECIATE THAT [inaudible] PLEASE BEGIN. CHECK MY WATCH GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GEORGE PEREZ SAID ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. I CAN'T SAY THAT I'VE ARGUED A CASE IN COURT IN QUITE AWHILE -- AND WHILE I DISAGREE WITH MANY OF THE ASSERTIONS THAT WERE JUST MADE I WILL SAY I DO AGREE. THAT WE SHOULD GO FORWARD AND CONDUCT THIS AUDIT AND WE WILL COME WILL COOPERATE CERTAINLY COOPERATE WITH ANY DECISION YOU MAKE REGARDING THIS REQUEST AND WE ARE PREPARED TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS THERE MAY BE OR SHARING ANY DOG GUARDING THE QUEUE IN THE PROGRAM I BELIEVE THE DIVISION HAS ADMINISTERED THIS PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANDATES OF THE LEGISLATURE. IT CERTAINLY IS WORTH LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF Q. IN THESE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY CAN ADEQUATELY SERVE OUR INJURED WORKERS. AND WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE REASONS FOR THESE DECLINING NUMBERS I THINK IT'S REALLY EASY TO SAY THAT OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS HAS RESULTED IN THE CLAIM NUMBERS A Q. ENEMIES. BUT WE DO NEED TO CONSERVE GIVE CONSIDERATION OTHERFACTORS NO STATEWIDE SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS AND MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN REPORTS IN THE MEDIA LATELY ABOUT THAT. IN THIS SHIFT IN THE WAY MEDICINE IS PRACTICED MANY PHYSICIANS ARE NOW WORKING FOR LARGER HEALTH CARE GROUPS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THEIR PHYSICIANS. TO TO CONDUCT Q. IN THE EVALUATIONS SOME ONLY LIMIT THEIR PHYSICIANS TO ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES PER PATIENT AND THAT'S TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR OUR SYSTEM. WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR PHYSICIANS IN Q. INCLUDING OUR Q. IN THESE ARE REACHING RETIREMENT AGE AND JUST LEAVING THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS WE NEED TO TAKE THAT ALL INTO CONSIDERATION AND I WILL SAY INCLUDING OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AND A FOR Q. ME HAS LEFT OUR SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT THEY WILL BE IDENTIFIED AS AS AS ABUSING OUR BILLING PRACTICE AND THEY HAVE AND THEY'VE LEFT. THE SYSTEM OF AND I THINK THAT'S FINE. ONE THING IS CERTAIN OUR Q. ENEMIES HVE MORE AND MORE WORK THE NUMBER OF HANDLE REQUESTS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FOR Q. IN THE EVALUATIONS HAVE GONE UP. SUBSTANTIALLY FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND LAST YEAR. IN THIS. EXIST DESPITE THE FACT THAT SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY THREE WHICH CAME INTO EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN IT REMOVED MEDICAL TREATMENT DISPUTES FROM THE CUE I MEANS FROM AN AREA OF Q. AMIS REVIEW. THIS INCREASED LITIGATION IN OUR SYSTEM MAY BE AT THE HEART OF THIS PROBLEM REGARDLESS AS I SAY ALL THESE FACTORS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WE WILL CERTAINLY A SYSTEM EXAMINING THIS MATTER. THE TAUGHT THERE IS TALK OF THE FEE SCHEDULE THE DIVISION IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVISING THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT IS REASONABLE AND WHAT IS NOT GIVEN ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SYSTEM BUT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT WE HELD STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS LAST OCTOBER. WE RECEIVED PROPOSALS FROM STAY CALL THE SCHEDULE IN DECEMBER AND WE ANTICIPATE IN THE NEXT MONTH WE'LL CONDUCTING ADDITIONAL MEETINGS SO THAT WE CAN REACH THAT REASONABLE REASONABLE COMPENSATION FOR THE PHYSICIANS IN OUR SYSTEM WHO DO THESE EVALUATIONS. THE RAND CORPORATION HAS REVIEWED OUR FEE SCHEDULE AND FOUND IT TO BE ADEQUATE AND IN LINE WITH OTHER STATES. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER WE DO MOVING FORWARD IN THIS AREA THAT THE RULES ARE CLEAR AND THE TYPES OF MEDICAL REPORTS THAT NEED TO BE SUBMITTED. IS VERY VERY OBVIOUS TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY VERY IMPORTANTLY -- PHYSICIANS GET PAID FOR THE WORK THEY DO. I LOOK FORWARD TO INITIATING FORMAL RULE MAKING ON THIS PROCESS IN THE YEAR AND HAVING THIS INEFFECTIVE FAIRLY SOON. WHILE I CAN'T SAY I CERTAINLY CAN'T SAY THAT I AGREE WITH SEVERAL THE ASSERTIONS MADE IN THIS AUDIT REPORT IN THIS AUDIT REQUEST ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT SOME OF OUR THAT THE THAT WE MAY BE SOMEHOW CONSPIRING WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT DEBATING THESE POINTS WILL TAKE US TO THE SOLUTIONS ARE SYSTEM NEEDS. TO THAT END THE STATE AUDITOR IF THIS AUDIT IS CONDUCTED CAN LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE AND CERTAINLY REACH THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE ADMINISTER THIS PROCESS THANK YOU AS WITH AUDITS WE HOPE THERE'S CLARITY. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT -- TESTIMONY PLACE HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS AMY WILSON ON THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL COOLEY IS THE COMPLETE BRIEFING AT SIZE WE APPRECIATE ABSOLUTELY -- JUST BEGIN BY SAYING THAT SHOULD THE COMMITTEE BE ASSURED THAT LABOR AGENCY AND THE DIVISION ARE PREPARED TO COOPERATE AND SUPPORT THE AUDITOR IN ITS FULFILLMENT -- IN IN THAT SPIRIT YOU KNOW THE DIVISION HAS SOUGHT TO BE FORTHCOMING IN ITS RESPONSE THAT IT SUBMITTED LAST WEEK TO THE COMMITTEE. ADDRESSING THE ITEMS -- IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT REQUEST LETTER -- AND WE FURTHER ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE ADDITIONAL INCLUSION -- OF THE ITEM WE NOTED IN THE LETTER OF THE REVIEW OF THE QUEUE ANY REPORTS AND CORRESPONDING BILLINGS -- WE BELIEVE THIS AREA OF INQUIRY WOULD SUPPORT THE MEMBERS INTENT TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF POTENTIAL ABUSE IN THE SYSTEM FOR THE OVERALL GOAL OF ENSURING APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY TREATMENT OF INJURED WORKERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL -- TESTIMONY OR COMMENTS FROM ANY AFFECTED AGENCIES I WISH TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME. HEARING AND SEEING NONE I WILL TURN IT BACK TO MEMBERS ON THE DíAS FOR QUESTIONS WE WILL BEGIN WITH SENATOR TO BURKE. DON'T YOU YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD WELCOME THE AUDIT WHICH IS GOOD I A QUESTION I HAVE IS. WOULD YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH THE ASSERTIONS MADE. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY I WAS SHE SAID YOU'RE STARTING A PROCESS THAT YOU'VE GOT A NUMBER OF FACTORS AT PLAY -- BUT CLEARLY YOU KNOW HAVING THE BACKLOG WITH RESPECT TO WORKERS COMP IT'S ALREADY TOUGH ENOUGH AS IT IS IS NOT A GOOD THING. IN YOUR JUDGMENT DO YOU THINK THIS AUDIT COULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HELP THAT. IS YOU HELP GIVE US GUIDANCE AND ALLEGE OR TO GET RID OF SOME OF THAT BACK ON GAINES POSSIBLE THAT COULD HAPPEN. I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE COULD HAPPEN -- I THINK TAKING A LOOK AT THE SYSTEM -- IT IS VERY TIMELY IT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME BUT OF COURSE OUR SYSTEM YOUR SYSTEM IS CHANGING. THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE IS CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE DISPUTES IN WORKERS COMPENSATION YOU HAVE BEEN CHANGING OVER THE YEARS AND SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S ALWAYS HEALTHY TO LOOK AT THE PROCESSES WE HAVE. AND SEE WHAT KIND OF RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT OBSERVATIONS CAN BE MADE BY A NEUTRAL OBSERVER -- MAYBE MAYBE THAT WILL TAKE US TO A GOOD PLACE OKAY THANKS. CARE. SENATOR ROTH PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ARE CORRECT WITH RESPECT TO THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. AND PHYSICIANS WHO WERE COMING OUT OF RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. TEND TO MIGRATE TO THE LARGER GROUP PRACTICES. AND NOT TO THE SMALL A GROUP PRACTICES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. SO GIVEN THAT IF IF I'M RIGHT AND IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND I THINK WE BOTH ARE. OF WHAT. WHAT IS YOUR DIVISION WHAT IS THE THE AGENCY DOING -- TO TO THINK AHEAD AND PLAN -- FOR MEDICAL EVALUATION. UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES -- THAT'S ONE THING I WILL SAY IS THAT THE DIVISION HAS NEVER REALLY CONDUCTED OUTREACH IN TERMS OF TRYING TO BRING CUBIES INTO OUR SYSTEM. NO WE HAVE PUT OUT AT THE ESSENTIALLY NEWS L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G SAYING&lt;/c&gt; WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A QUEUE IN THE EXAM. PEOPLE SHOW UP AND TAKE THE EXAM AND I MUST SAY I KNOW I WILL CERTAINLY SAY THE QUEUE IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM -- ARE ARE EXCELLENT PHYSICIANS -- BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO START LOOK GOOD GOING BEYOND THAT -- WE NEED TO START GOING TO THESE LARGER MEDICAL GROUPS AND SEEING HOW WE CAN INCORPORATE THEM INTO OUR SYSTEM. I'M I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A VALUABLE STEP FORWARD AND I AND I REALLY WANT TO WORK IN THAT DIRECTION -- THANK YOU MISTER I LOOK FORWARD -- TO SEEING WHAT THE STATE AUDITOR FINDS ASSUMING THIS REQUEST IS APPROVED. THANK YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE -- SALOON RUBIO WORKING WITH OUR STAFF AND THE SCOPE IN CRAFTING OF THE LETTER -- DELVING INTO SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE AGENCIES AS WELL WE'VE KNOW THAT Q. AND ME'S. AT ONE POINT WE HAD -- A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM SWITCH MEANT WORKERS WERE ABLE TO SEE A QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINER. WE KNOW THOSE NUMBERS OF DIDN'T DECREASED I BELIEVE AN AUDIT WILL SHED SOME LIGHT AS TO WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT INJURED WORKERS AREN'T WAITING. UNNECESSARILY LONGER THAN THEY NEED TO BE -- AND MAYBE WE COULD IDENTIFY SOME BEST PRACTICES MOVING FORWARD TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE AS WE BEGIN OUR BUDGET DISCUSSIONS AND SUCH FORTH -- MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT LET ME ASK ASSEMBLY WOMAN REVIEW IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON MOVING FORWARD WITH THE AUDIT ALRIGHT LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE WE MOVE TO A VOTE. HEARING AND SEEING NANA HOW RETURN IT BACK TO THE DíAS ASK FOR IS THERE A MOTION ON THIS ITEM. THE MOTION BY MISTER WORD SECONDED BY MISTER HERTZBERG -- THE STRUCTURE CALL THE ROLL.

MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS BY SENATOR MORLOCK. CONSIDER MORE LIKE WHEN YOU ARE READY TO PROCEED PLEASE DO SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'LL. DO THAT TIME I WILL KEEP THIS BRIEF -- THIS IS NOT -- ANOTHER REQUEST AS A RESULT OF ANYTHING I FOUND THAT -- IS OF OF OF SUPER -- IS YOUR CONCERN OTHER THAN OF MY MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS SAY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP YOU NEED TO SPEND A DIME TO MAKE A QUARTER AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN ORANGE COUNTY. TO DO THAT WORKERS COMPENSATION RESOLUTIONS COMBINED LARGE AMOUNTS IN RESTRICTED BANK ACCOUNTS TO COVER ANTICIPATED FUTURE COSTS. AND WE HAVE TO ASK OUR THOSE RESERVES ADEQUATE ARE THEY TO HIRE THE TOO LOW. AND CAN SETTLEMENT TO BE NEGOTIATED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THOSE THAT ARE -- DEALING WITH ONGOING MEDICAL ISSUES FROM WORKERS COMP RELATED -- EVENTS. OUR OUR OUR OUR OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE ARE IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UTILIZING THE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE COUNTY OF ORANGE RETAIN THE LEGAL FIRM BY. THREE NEW TO ME TO REVIEW THE STATUS OF THE RESERVES OVERSEEN. BY ITS RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT. IN AFTER IT WAS DONE OVER A PERIOD TIME IN REDUCE RESERVES BY FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. BY LEGITIMATE FAIR AND PROFESSIONAL. REARRANGEMENTS TO CLOSE CASES ORANGE COUNTY'S ANNUAL BUDGET IS ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION SO FORTY TWO MILLION MAY NOT BE A LARGE AMOUNT BUT IT COMPARED TO A STATE. BUDGET LIKE OURS WE COULD PROBABLY LOOK AT SAVINGS NEAR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. OR WE FIND OUT THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE GREAT WORKERS COMP -- SETTLEMENT. I ISSUES -- INSIDE THE COUNTY AND SEARCH GIVEN BY THE STATE I I HAVE WORKED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY RIVERS AND LIVES ON THEIR RESERVES. AND THEIR STAFF IS ASSURED ME THAT THERE ARE -- DOING QUITE WELL BUT PERHAPS THE STATE AUDITOR CAN USE THEM AS BENCHMARKS OR MODELS FOR OTHERS. AND THE STATE WORKERS COMPENSATION -- FIND AT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE BY THE THE APPLICANTS THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING THE BENEFITS AND THE TAXPAYERS.

HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THOSE -- PROCESSES AND AND REALLY HANDLING THOSE WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. IN ADDITION OTHER SENATORS ASKED US TO LOW AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE AS FAR AS SETTING THE RESERVE AMOUNTS. OF FOR PAYMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS AND THEN HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT A SAMPLE OF CLAIMS AT THE DEPARTMENTS AND CERTAINLY AT STATE FUND -- TO ASSESS THEIR PROCESS -- FOR HANDLING THOSE WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS FOR PROCESSING THEM HOW TIMELY ARE THERE HOW APPROPRIATE IS IT AND REALLY TRYING TO IDENTIFY -- AN AVERAGE INCOME POTENTIALLY COMPARING THAT TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS TO SEE IF THERE ARE. WAYS THAT THE STATE CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT AND THESE PER AGENCIES IN PARTICULAR CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT IN PROCESSING WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND GET THE GETTING THE PAYMENTS TO THE INJURED WORKERS. AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT LOS RUN REPORTS -- AND LOOKING AT THOSE REPORTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE TOTAL COST INCURRED THE TOTAL BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID ANY OUTSTANDING RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE FOR OPEN CLAIMS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON THIS ITEM -- BUT SURE MEMBERS AS YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ITEM THAT I AM. DEEPLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ITS IS AN ITEM THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE EFFECTS THAT. THERE BE POLICIES OF HAD ON THE MOST -- COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE -- WITH THAT SAID YOU KNOW I AM PREPARED TO RESUBMIT -- THE AUDIT REQUEST BASED OFF THE ANSWERS FROM THE AGENCY AND DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. WHERE TO BEGIN? I FEEL LIKE MY PASSION IS IS OVERWHELMING ME JUST A BIT. JUST BECAUSE OF I KEEP THINKING OF THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE. THAT ARE SUFFERING THE MOST UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE YET I KNOW THEY DON'T EXIST ONLY IN MY COMMUNITIES WITH THE EXISTING COMMUNITIES. PROBABLY FOR EVERYONE SITTING AROUND THE DíAS -- IT IS FOR THAT REASON WHY FOUGHT SO HARD WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE PASSED ONE OF THOSE MEASURE MEASURES WAS ASSEMBLY BILL -- THREE NINETY EIGHT BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH I BELIEVE -- SUPERMAJORITY OF MEMBERS VOTED FOR NOT ONLY IN THE ASSEMBLY BUT ALSO IN THE SENATE AS WELL. AND IN THAT WE FOUGHT VERY HARD TO BE THE MEASURES -- TO ENSURE THAT THE POLICIES GOING FORWARD ACTUALLY. MADE A DIFFERENCE IN SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND WHAT WERE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS. AND SO -- THREE MONTHS AGO THE ELIO BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN ASSEMBLY BILL THREE NINETY EIGHT ISSUED A REPORT IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT IDENTIFIED SEVERAL ISSUES WHEN LOOKING AT THE OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND BENEFITS -- LOOKING AT GHQ PROGRAMS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSPORTATION ADMISSION POLICIES A CARB. LET ME STATE FOR THE RECORD -- THE COMMITMENT AND CONTINUING EFFORT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEIR RESOURCES BOARD TO IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND REDUCING. GAS EMISSIONS ANOTHER CREATURE YOUR PLANS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND MITIGATE OUR CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMMENDABLE. AND A LOT OF ALL GOAL. AND IT IS WELL DESERVING OF OUR ATTENTION AND RECOGNITION WELL WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. THE EFFECTS OF POOR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE OF DRAMATIC AND LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ON THE AND AND IN THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE. AND AND WE KNOW THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT ONLY. HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR LIVES BUT TO OUR KIDS AND SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN CARB DESIGNATED. FORTY FIVE OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS NON ATTAINMENT JONES TO SAY THAT AGAIN. FORTY FIVE OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE. OUR IN NON ATTAINMENT. THESE COUNTIES MAKE UP ABOUT 75% OF THE STATE INCLUDE THOSE IN SACRAMENTO VALLEY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THE INLAND EMPIRE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND EVEN -- SOME COUNTIES CLOSE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND SOME OF THE COASTAL REGIONS AS WELL. AIR QUALITY THAT EXIST IN OUR STATE RESULTS IN REAL AND SERIOUS HEALTH RISKS TO OUR STATE AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE DISTRICTS AND CONSTITUENTS -- THAT I REPRESENT IN THAT MANY OF YOU REPRESENT AS WELL. SOME OF THESE RISKS BUT CALIFORNIA'S AT RISK FOR PREMATURE DEATH AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS SUCH AS ASTHMA. AND LUNG CANCER. AREAS IN A THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE CONSISTENTLY RANKED AS HAVING THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE STATE AND EVEN THE NATION. KERN IN KINGS COUNTY OR FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED AS EXTREME. pACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION THE CITY OF BIGGER STILL RANKS WORST SECOND WORST AND THIRD WORST IN THE NATION FOR THREE CATEGORIES OF OUR QUALITY. LIVING IN POVERTY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED TO AIR POLLUTION. HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND PEOPLE WHO DO NOT OWN CAR SUFFER VEHICLE POLLUTION LEVELS. AVERAGE. CENTRAL BAKERSFIELD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAVE THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF PARTICULATE MATTER POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES. OWING IN PART TO GEOGRAPHIC AND WHETHER DIFFERENCES. THAT RETAIN POLLUTION IN THESE AREAS. ROUGHLY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ABOUT 19% OF THE STATE POPULATION LIVE IN POVERTY. THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OUR QUALITY AND EMISSIONS MUST BE FACTORED INTO POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT OUR STATE HAS IMPLEMENTED TO APPROVE AIR QUALITY. AND ACHIEVING AIR QUALITY GOALS FOR THE FUTURE. THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE POOREST REGIONS OF THE STATE AND IN AREAS WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY ARE DIRECTLY LINKED. AS WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ADDRESSING AIR QUALITY IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE EXAMINE AND UNDERSTAND THE MOST EFFICIENT. AND COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ACHIEVE OUR THAT IS WHY I AM REQUESTING. FOR US TO LOOK AT AN AUDIENCE. ON THE TRANSPORTATION POLICIES OF THE PROGRAMS OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. SO THAT WE CAN BE WELL INFORMED. ABOUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AND HELPING TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF HEALTH OUTCOMES OF THE AREAS WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. I WOULD LIKE TO MEANT TO COMMAND CARP FOR BEING HERE TODAY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS AUDIT. AND FOR OUR SHARED COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING INCENTIVES AND PROGRAMS TO THE MOST ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY DISADVANTAGED. AREAS OF OUR STATE. CARVERS MADE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HELP ADDRESS THESE ISSUES FOR INSTANCE IN 20171880% OF THE FUNDING. UP FOR FUNDING AGRICULTURE REPLACE MEASURES FOR MISSIONS REDUCE REDUCTION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. HOWEVER THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES AND UNKNOWN COSTS AND BENEFITS BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT. TO MANY OF THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND ENSURING THAT WE INVEST HEAVILY. IN THE MOST POLLUTED AND POOREST AREAS OF OUR STATE. FOR EXAMPLE I JON MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES FROM RULE CAN COUNTIES INVOICING OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF INVESTMENT. IN ELECTRICAL VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS FOR RURAL AREAS. AND ON A SIDE NOTE ALL. THERE WAS A SENATOR ONE OF OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES WHO ACTUALLY CAME TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY -- TO TO TO HOST A HEARING WHICH WE HOSTED TOGETHER. HAD A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TIME FINDING A PLACE. TO PLUG IN HIS OWN VEHICLE. OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED IN THE VOLKSWAGON CYCLE TO Z. E. V. INVESTMENT PLAN. ONLY TWO MILLION OR 1% OF THAT MONEY IS PROPOSED FOR RULE CHARGING STATIONS. THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AND ADDRESSED MOVING FORWARD AS WE INVEST IN POLICIES AND PLANS TO IMPROVE OUR QUALITY IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE UNDERSTAND. THE IMPACT THAT THESE WILL HAVE ON OUR STATE WHICH IS WHAT THE OUT A REQUEST WOULD HELP TO ACHIEVE. I AM PROUD TO VOTED FOR LAST YEAR'S EXTENSION. OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM MAYBE THREE NINETY EIGHT CAN YOU TO BE AN ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER FOR THE NATION IN THE WORLD. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE REPORT RELEASED A REPORT THAT WAS REQUIRED THAT WAS REQUIRED AS PART OF AB THREE NINETY EIGHT THERE. RAISES A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND I KNOW COSTS ABOUT THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN PLACE. THE LA -- REPORT ALSO CALLED FOR GREATER USE OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS TO ASSESS POLICY AFFECTS. AS ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS IN THE NATION AND THE WORLD. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ACT BOLDLY NOT BLINDLY. IT IS THE HOPE OF THIS REQUEST THAT WE REVIEW AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS AN OPPORTUNITY COST OF THESE POLICIES ON THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. THIS CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TOOLS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POLICIES MOVING FORWARD [inaudible] AND THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M JUST GOING TO GO TO MY CLOSING REMARKS MISTER CHAIR. IN CONCLUSION I BELIEVE NO AGENCY SHOULD BE ABOVE REPROACH. NO AGENCY SHOULD BE ABOVE REPROACH AND IT IS OUR DUTY AS LEGISLATORS WHO ARE STEWARDS OF THE TAX. PAYER DOLLAR TO DOLLAR TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT IS EFFICIENT. AND RESPONSIVE TO CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS IT IS MY INTENTION TO CONTINUE TO EXAMINE AND REVIEW CARBON OTHERS TO ENSURE WE ARE GETTING THE MOST EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE USE OF OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ARE TRUE TO THE GOVERNOR'S WORDS -- THAT HE SAID DURING HIS STATE OF THE STATE. WHERE HE CALLED FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY AND MORE ACCOUNTABILITY? WE NEED TO STAND UP AND TAKE AN ANALYTICAL HAVING IN OUR MOST POLLUTED COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND AUDIT CAN HELP PROVIDE THE NUMBERS WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHICH PROGRAMS ARE WORKING. AND WHICH ONES ARE NOT ARE WE GETTING THE DESIRED REDUCTIONS IN OUR MOST POLLUTED AREAS WHERE OUR FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING. THANK YOU MISTER GIVE ME WITNESSES. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE MOVING TO THE STATE. MINIMUM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS INDICATED IT WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ONE SET OF OBJECTIVES IS LOOKING AT EXISTING POLICIES AND THIS IS. WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS -- AND LOOKING AT A SELECTION OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE HAD A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IMPACT -- AND PARTICULARLY IF THERE'S INTERACTIONS WITH VARIOUS PROGRAMS AS WELL BUT LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SELECTION OF SOME OF THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WERE INTENDED TO REDUCE OVERALL EMISSIONS AND AND BE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS -- HE'S ALSO ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS REGIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CLEANING THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AS FAR AS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTS AND BENEFITS OF SOME OF THESE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS ON REGIONS OF THE STATE. PARTICULARLY INCLUDING SAN JOAQUIN THEN ANOTHER OBJECTIVE IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE BE HAS DONE TO EVALUATE NEW POLICIES OR PROGRAMS THEY HOPE TO IMPLEMENT. AND WHAT FACTORS DID ON THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD CONSIDER WHEN CONDUCTING THOSE ANALYSES SO WE WOULD BE EXPECTING TO SEE THEM LOOKING AT AFFECTS AND BENEFITS TO AIR QUALITY EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. REGIONAL AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS TO SIT THEIR ANALYSIS AND WHAT FACTORS DID THEY INCLUDE IN CONDUCTING THAT ANALYSIS. ALSO LOOKING AT THESE ANALYSES TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A ARE BE CONSIDERED AN ANALYZED AGAIN INTERACTION BETWEEN A NEW PROGRAM AND AN EXISTING PROGRAM. TO THE EXTENT THERE MAY BE DETRIMENTAL. OUTCOMES WITH RESPECT TO THAT ALSO LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT A R. B. AGAIN IN CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES CONSIDERED. MEASURABLE OUTCOME SO THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR IMPROVEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM -- AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE OUR KEY OBJECTIVE IS REALLY LOOKING AT A ARBY'S PROCESS FOR EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THESE TRANSPORTATION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. AGAIN ARE THEY CONSIDERING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PARTICULAR PROGRAMS ARE THERE WAYS A. R. B. COULD IMPROVE HOW IT MEASURES THE EFFECTS AND BENEFITS OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS -- THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE STATE. AND THEN -- IDENTIFYING PROGRAMS THAT ARE BOTH EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING GAS EMISSIONS BUT PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE NOT SO THE STATE COULD MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AS TO WHICH PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN. AND THOSE PERHAPS THAT ARE NOT AS BENEFICIAL AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED -- THE BUDGET FOR THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT IS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED HOURS WE THINK SOME OF THE ANALYSES WILL BE RELATIVELY COMPLEX WE ALSO AS I SAID SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES ARE REALLY LOOKING AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND WHAT ANALYSES HAVE THEY COMPLETED. OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND CERTAINLY ANY PROGRAMS THAT THEY HOPE -- TO IMPLEMENT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MISTER [inaudible] AMANDA MARKETERS -- OR ANY OTHER AFFECTED AGENCY -- WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD? THANK YOU VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON IT RICHARD CORY MAKE SECOND OF OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO AND SPEAK WITH YOU. THE FEW REMARKS I'D LIKE TO MAKE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. AS YOU ARE AWARE. MANY OF CARBS PROGRAMS ACHIEVE A TRIPLE. BANG FOR THE BUCK REDUCING CRITERION TOXIC EMISSIONS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT COMMUNITY HEALTH. AS WELL AS REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS AFFECT CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS IS OUR GOAL WE'RE DEVELOPING POLICY OUR PACKAGE OF POLICIES REGULATORY AND INCENTIVES ARE DRIVEN BY STATE LEGISLATIVE MANDATES. AND APPROPRIATIONS AS WELL AS A REQUIREMENT TO ACHIEVE FEDERAL. HEALTH PROTECTIVE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. DUE TO LOCAL AND STATE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS INCENTIVES AND INITIATIVES EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN TRENDING DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD. THIS PROGRESSES WHY ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD COPY CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM. IS REGULATIONS RANGE FROM SETTING VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS FOR CLEANER FUELS DEVELOPING CLEANER FORMULATIONS FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS. A FEW EXAMPLES OF OUR PROGRESS TODAY DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSIONS WHICH HAVE SERIOUS LOCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLICATIONS HAVE DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 80% SINCE 199080%. IN RESPONSE TO A SERIES REGULATIONS VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND SENATE BASED PROGRAMS CARBON PLUMMETED. OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS STATE WIDE EMISSIONS AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH IMPACTS FROM AIR TOXICS EXPOSURE HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY ABOUT 75%. AS AN EXAMPLE IN RIVERSIDE THE SIDE OF OUR FUTURE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOTOR VEHICLE TESTING FACILITY. THE SKIES ARE VISIBLY CLEARER AND THE NUMBER OF ON HEALTHY DAIS. IS ONE THIRD WHAT IT WAS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. EMISSIONS FROM A NEW CAR ARE 99% CLEANER. THAN A CAR FROM THE NINETEEN SEVENTY SANDERS ESTABLISHED IN CALIFORNIA THIS PROGRESSES IN RESPONSE THAT WORK AND FOLLOWED NATIONALLY. AS I MENTIONED THE STANDARDS SET HERE COPY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. THUS PEOPLE WELL BEYOND OUR BORDERS. BENEFIT FROM CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP ON CLEAN AIR. LET ME BE CLEAR ON THIS POINT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S MORE WORK AHEAD OF US APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS NEARLY FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS STILL LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT EXCEED. THE FEDERALLY HEALTH PROTECTIVE STANDARDS EXPOSURE TO DIESEL PARTICULATES. IS TOO HIGH ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES NEAR FREIGHT FACILITIES [inaudible] PORTS RAILYARDS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. AND TO THE MAIN POINTS RAISED IN LA -- THIS REPORT. THE REPORT WAS DRIVEN BY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION IS NOTED AB THREE NINETY EIGHT WHICH DIRECTED LA -- TO LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND BENEFITS OF CALIFORNIANS GHG GOALS. REPORT USES GHG REDUCTION LANDS. DOES NOT CONSIDER THE OTHER STATE GRAMS THE FOCUS ON REDUCING OTHER FORMS OF POLLUTION OZONE PARTICULATE MATTER. TO CHEAP AIR QUALITY REDUCTIONS AND METER HEALTH BASED AIR QUALITY STANDARDS IN COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE SOUTH COAST IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. BY APPROACHING THE REPORT FROM A PURE GHG FOCUS THE LA -- REPORT CONCLUDES THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE RELYING MORE ON CAP AND TRADE FOR CHEATING GHG GOALS. THIS APPROACH MISSIONS MISSES THE OTHER KEY DRIVERS REGARDING OUR TRANSPORTATION STRATEGIES THE NEED TO REDUCE KNOCKS EMISSIONS. AND TOXIC POLLUTANTS IN SHORT. THE FOCUS FOR PROGRAMS IS MUCH MORE DIVERSE. AND THE PACKAGE OF POLICIES THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IS BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE. EMISSIONS TO CHEAPER FEDERAL MANDATES STATE REQUIRED STATUTORY PROGRAMS ENERGY THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. FURTHER. THE PLANS ARE HOLISTICALLY PRESENTED IN THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. AS WELL AS THE SCOPING PLAN. ANOTHER KEY POINT IS TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO MEETING OUR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS SPECIFICALLY. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS 40% OF OUR GHG EMISSIONS. 80% OF OUR KNOCKS EMISSIONS. AND ABOUT 95% OF OUR DIESEL PM EMISSIONS THE SECTOR CONSISTS OF OVER THIRTY MILLION CARS TRUCKS. CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT MARINE VESSELS BUSES MOTORCYCLES IN THE LIST GOES ON THE STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING EMISSION REDUCTIONS MUST CONSIDER. THE COSTS AS WELL AS THE FEASIBILITY. IN SHORT THERE'S NO SINGLE SOLUTION WE CANNOT ACHIEVE HEALTHIER QUALITY. TO REACH OUR CLARA CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT THE MULTI PART AIR QUALITY GOALS WITHOUT A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH FURTHER. DISTRESS OLDEST MISTER GORE. THIS -- FORTUNATELY AS A TWO MINUTE RULE ON PRESENTATIONS AND I TEND TO BE PRETTY LIBERAL THAT. FOR EVERYBODY SO BUT HAVING SAID THAT I I WOULD I THINK I NEED TO ASK YOU. TO GET CLOSE TO WRAPPING UP I WOULD EL DO THAT AND THIRTY SECONDS. AS CHAIR SO WITH IN MY REMARKS. RESPOND TO EACH OF THE QUICK QUESTIONS THAT WAS RAISED IN THE J. LACKS LETTER TO US. IN MY POINT IS. THIS QUESTIONS WERE REASONABLE APPROPRIATE. NO DEBATE ON THAT. MY POINT IS. THE RESPONSE TO THOSE QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS TO DEVELOP REX THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE WE POST THIS INFORMATION THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN FACT. BECAUSE OF FITNESS INFORMATION FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROCEEDS IS SUBMITTED ANNUALLY. TO LEGISLATURE. TO MY POINT IS BY VIRTUE OF FORCE THE LEGISLATURE BY VIRTUE OF DOCUMENTS THAT WE ANALYZE AND TRACK EMISSIONS. COMPLIANCE WE DO MANUAL COMPLIANCE REPORT COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS MY POINT IS THE RESPONSE I BELIEVE THOSE QUESTIONS. IS ALREADY AVAILABLE AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH STAFF AND WALK THROUGH THAT WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY UNTIL. I TO TODAY SO IN CLOSING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S THERE'S A LOT HERE WHAT I JUST SAID. BUT IN FACT THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT WOULD ACCOMPLISH OVER THIRTY PROGRAMS. BUT AGAIN MY MAIN POINT IS I BELIEVE THE F. MATERIALS. WE ALONG WITH MY TEAM -- OPEN THE MEETING WITH MEMBERS OR YOUR RESPECTIVE STAFF TO DISCUSS MATERIALS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WERE ALSO OPEN TO DISCUSSING HOW TO BETTER DISSEMINATE INFORMATION WITHOUT I'LL CONCLUDE. THANK YOU WELL BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR A QUESTIONS -- LET ME JUST MAKE A COMMENT AND ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS MYSELF TO SORT OF SET THE STAGE -- FOR OTHER QUESTIONS THAT MAY FOLLOW -- MISS CHAIRS YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE FOR SINCE I READ THIS REQUEST ABOUT THE BREADTH OF THE REQUEST. FRANKLY IT APPEARS TO ME BASED ON THE THE QUESTIONS AND THE ISSUES TO BE STUDIED. BY THE STATE AUDITOR TO BE ABOVE STATEWIDE PROGRAMMATIC REVIEW OF THE YEAR RESOURCES BOARDS. GRAMS WHICH MAY BE APPROPRIATE -- AT SOME POINT BUT PERHAPS NOT AT THIS TIME AND PERHAPS NOT IN THIS. IN THIS FORM OF THIS WAY. BASED ON YOUR OPENING. AND YOUR CLOSING I GUESS IT APPEARS THAT YOUR PRIMARY CONCERN WHICH IS A JUSTIFIABLE. ONE IS EQUITY FUNDING IN THIS OTHER AREAS -- IN THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS NON ATTAINMENT AREAS IS THAT. IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT. THAT THAT'S THE FIRST I'VE BEEN MISTER -- MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR MISTER ROTH ECONOMY LIKE. HELLO SO HAVING SAID THAT LET ME JUST AS THE ME JUST ASK. OF SOME FOLKS IN QUESTIONS I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN GET AT LEAST INITIALLY GET AT SOME OF THIS INFORMATION -- IN ANOTHER WAY -- SCORE YOU'VE HEARD. THE COMMITTEE CHAIR. SOMEONE OVER SALAS EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT EQUITY FUNDING -- IN THE STATE NOT ONLY IN THE AREA THAT HE REPRESENTS BUT PERHAPS OTHERS BUT CERTAINLY WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS AREA BECAUSE THAT'S THE YEAR HE REPRESENTS. HE'S ASK FOR THE STATE AUDITOR TO JUMP IN HERE AND DO AN AUDIT BECAUSE HE'S HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING INFORMATION FROM APPARENTLY FROM ME -- RESOURCES BOARD AND HE'D LIKE THE INFORMATION TO DELIVER TO BE DELIVERED IN SOME. WRITTEN FORMAT -- NOW ARE YOU. OR IS HE A ARE BE ABLE TO AND WILLING TO WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO GET HIM THE INFORMATION THAT HE HAS REQUESTED WITH RESPECT IN PARTICULAR TO EQUITY FUNDING IN THE NON ATTAINMENT AREAS WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE ONE THAT HE REPRESENTS. ABSOLUTELY. AND WHAT TIMELINE WOULD YOU NEED TO DO TO HAVE IN ORDER TO DO THAT. BEFORE WE DECIDE IF HE'S WILLING TO DO SO -- TO REVISIT THIS REQUEST. THE FIRST STEP IS HE'LL HAVE A REPORT BY THE END OF THIS WEEK THAT DOCUMENTS G. G. R. F. CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES. BY BASED ON LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS THAT ALSO TRACKS AB FIFTY YOU KNOW FIVE WHICH IS HOW MUCH OF THOSE DOLLARS IS GOING AND DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SO LET THIS WEEK FIRST REPORT. FIRST WELL AND AND AND I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN. IN A OR B. RESPONDING DIRECTLY TO REMEMBER TO THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE ON HIS SPECIFIC REQUESTS SO WHAT ADDITIONAL TIME WE YOU NEED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THOSE. I I'D LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN. WITH THE HIS STAFF NEXT WEEK WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE AD FUNDING THERE THE INFORMATION THAT WAS DESCRIBED IS ALREADY AVAILABLE I DON'T NEED TO PULL I'VE JUST WILL DRAW FROM WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS APPROPRIATIONS WHERE THOSE DOLLARS HAVE GONE HOW MUCH OF GOING INTO THE VALLEY SO I'M READY TO SIT DOWN. NOW. WELL MISTER CHAIR ONE APPROACH YOU MIGHT. CONSIDER TAKING HERE IS. TO TAKE UP THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON ITS OFFER TO PROVIDE TO NOT ONLY SIT DOWN WITH YOU BUT MY INTENT WOULD BE TO HAVE THEM PROVIDE YOU WAS WRITTEN. RESPONSES TO YOUR INQUIRY AND IF YOU DEEM THOSE RESPONSES TO BE SATISFACTORY -- I GUESS THAT COULD BE THE END OF IT IF YOU DEEM THE RESPONSES TO BE TO NOT BE SATISFACTORY. YOU COULD -- REVISIT YOUR AUDIT REQUEST WITH YOUR COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE YOUR DIPLOMACY AND ALL THE THE HOURS OF DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD ON THIS ITEM -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I STILL WANTED TO PROCEED AT LEAST. WITH PRESENTING TODAY'S AUDIT IS TO GET THINGS ON THE RECORD -- LIKE I STATED IN MY OPENING I DO CARE ABOUT THOSE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE SUFFERING THE MOST NOT ONLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATES WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT A COMMUNITY OFF THE FOUR OH FIVE FREEWAY. DOWN AT THE BORDER OR EVEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS YOU KNOW I CARE ABOUT THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THOSE FAMILIES ARE LIVING. EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN POOR AIR QUALITY STANDARDS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF PM TWO POINT FIVE ARE PM. TEN WE KNOW THAT. PREMATURE DEATHS -- THOSE FACTORS LEAD TO PREMATURE DEATH SLIGHTLY TO A NUMBER OF HEALTH OUTCOMES -- THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET I FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN. FIGHTING AND ARGUING FOR FOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND WHICH IS WHY. WHEN WE POSSIBLY BILL THREE NINETY EIGHT WE FOUGHT SO HARD TO INCLUDE SOME OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION SINCE THEN -- BUT FOR THE RECORD -- MISTER CHAIR OF I CAN'T PERHAPS SO WE CAN -- SPEED THIS ALONG WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS READ A LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE FOR THEIR BE SO THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

MISTER CHAIR I ASSUME -- THAT YOU WILL PROVIDE A COPY OF THOSE I NOTICED THAT THEY WERE TAKING NOTES FURIOUSLY BUT THAT YOU WILL PROVIDE A COPY OF THOSE. QUESTIONS TO THE A. R. B. REPRESENTATIVES. SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE ANSWERS MISSED COR YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ASKING. I DO YOU MAY NEED TO REVISE YOUR TIME ASIDE UPWARD I WILL INDEED -- THIS COMMITTEE MEETS PERIODICALLY IN THE NEXT MEETING IS. IS IN JUNE. WELL THE BILL WOULD REACT CLOSE AGAIN MISTER CHAIR YES. WE'LL GET TO A SHOPPING LIST. TO A MISTER CHAIR SO YOU'LL YOU HAVE THE ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE SCHEDULE SO I ASSUME IT WILL BE A MONTH OR SO BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE MEETS AGAIN AT LEAST. SO I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE THAT PERIOD OF TIME COULD COMPILE TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS QUESTIONS I WILL NEED SEVERAL WEEKS TO WRITE PREPARE WRITTEN RESPONSE THE MATERIAL EXIST BUT WE NEED TO PUT IT ALL IN ONE PLACE AT LEAST A MONTH. REAL RECTIFIED AND I APPRECIATE MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE -- THE TESTIMONY GIVEN THAT. THAT THE AUTO REQUEST THAT WE DID SO THAT WAS A REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE BUT PERHAPS THESE QUESTIONS WILL PROVIDE SOME CLARITY NOT ONLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BUT AS WE LOOK TO MOVE FORWARD AND POSSIBLY -- RESUBMITTED NOT A REQUEST -- BY LEASE WE HAVE EVERYTHING ON THE RECORD THAT SOMETHING THAT I DID WANT TO AT LEAST ACCOMPLISH HERE TODAY SO -- MISSED YOUR JUST TO MAKE MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE CLEAR. GIVEN THE AIR BEES COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS YOU WILL WITHDRAW YOUR REQUEST TODAY SUBJECT TO THE ABILITY TO RESUBMIT THE AUDIT REQUEST IF THE RESPONSES ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU. THAT IS CORRECT AND IT'S UNDER I BELIEVE OUR PURVIEW -- ALSO CALLED SPECIAL HEARING IF WE IF NEED BE ABSOLUTELY. NOW I THINK OF SOME OF YOUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OF FIRST CENTER HERTZBERG. THE DOCUMENT THAT YOU SUBMITTED MISTER CHAIRMAN TO THIS COMMITTEE ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHT SETS FORCE. FIVE QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE HAS THREE SUB PARTS THE SECOND ONE FOR THE THIRD TO IN THE LAST TWO DON'T. THOSE QUESTIONS MAY BE HAMMERED INTO THE LIST YOU JUST READ OF TWENTY FIVE QUESTIONS MANY OF WHICH HAD MANY SUBPART -- I'M JUST TELLING YOU AS A STUDENT OF THIS INSTITUTION I DON'T LIKE WHAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ASKING ANY AGES MARK AND TO REALLY DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND ASK THE QUESTIONS BUT WHAT I FEEL HERE TODAY IS THAT YOU WENT AND SUBMITTED A REQUEST YOU HAVE THE AUTHOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COME INTO THIS BODY. YOUR OF CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT YOU THEN HAD HER PREPARE REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THE FRAMEWORK IN PER VIEW AND TIME LINES NECESSARY. AND YOU CLEARLY HAVE HAD A VERY DETAILED LIST PREPARED BEFORE YOU SAT DOWN TODAY IN WHAT WAS BEFORE US TODAY ALL OF WHICH MAY BE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS BUT ALL MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF THE OF WHAT YOU ASKED HERE TODAY. WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THE AUDIT WAS THOSE QUESTIONS MAY OR MAY NOT BE INCLUDED THE ART I WOULD SUSPECT A LOT OF THEM WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE AUDIT. I CAN GO BACK TO AND READ THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK ON PAGE TWO OF YOUR TWO PAGE LETTER. WHICH IS BASICALLY A HALF LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A HALF A PAGE AND WHAT YOU JUST READ WAS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT. SO I I I WELL I HAVE DIFFERENCE TO THE VICE CHAIR AND TO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WITH RESPECT TO THIS I THINK FROM THE PROCESS STANDPOINT WELL THERE HAS BEEN I THINK DIPLOMACY ON THE PART OF THE ACTING CHAIR THE VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO RESPECT YOUR WISHES IT AND TO BRING THE CAR THE PEOPLE FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. I'M A LITTLE -- DISTRAUGHT ABOUT HOW THIS THING CAME ABOUT THEY WANT TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS THAT'S FINE BUT I'M VOTE NO ONE THIS AUDIT B. FOR NO OTHER I WAS GOING TO VOTE NO BEFORE A BILL NO AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK THE PROCESS HERE TODAY. IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE SHOULD COMPORT OURSELVES IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS INFORMATION NOT TAKEN THAT THAT TAX PAYERS MONEY TO WRITE UP A REPORT IF THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE CASE. THANK YOU. ADD IF I COULD ADDRESS THAT THANK YOU SAID HERTZBERG I APPRECIATE YOUR POINT OF VIEW -- OBVIOUSLY WE HAD SUBMITTED THIS THE QUESTIONS THAT WE FRAMED IN THE AUDIT WE'RE HOPING TO GET TO ALL THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE QUEST ONCE WE HAVE THIS INFORMATION. I THOUGHT IT WOULD INFORMED THE REST OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I HAD WHICH IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE POLICIES THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLICIES. MOVING FORWARD TO US IS LEGISLATORS WOULD HAVE THE DATA AVAILABLE. TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS TO MAKE SURE COMMUNITIES ARE SUFFERING THE MOST DON'T CONTINUE TO SUFFER THE MOST BECAUSE OUR POLICIES THAT I'VE SEEN WHERE. THEY SAY THE BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE BENEFITS THAT WE SEE UNTIL TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW MEANWHILE FAMILIES LIVING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE SUFFERING NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT THE HEART THAT WATER THOSE POLICIES. THAT WE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTING NOW AN EXPANDING ON TO HELP THOSE FAMILIES TODAY AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS -- SOME DISCOMFORT FOR MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE -- IN THE SENTENCE SO I WANTED TO ALLOW NOT ONLY US TO CONTINUE TO PROCEED DILIGENTLY ON THESE EFFORTS. BUT TO GIVE SOME TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES ALSO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE WERE GOING. AND LET ME JUST SAY I APPRECIATE -- THE WAY YOU'RE HANDLING THIS -- MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THAT -- CENTER. I THINK -- THE THE MAKER OF THIS ITEM NOW THAT YOU HAVE WITHDRAWN ON THE PROPOSED AGENDA ITEM -- PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A RESPONSE FROM -- THEY ARE BE I THINK I POINTS MOOD. EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT -- SINCE YOU'RE HAPPY MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS AND HOPEFULLY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE -- RESPONSIVE PARTNERS RESPONSE THE DEPARTMENT -- AND IF THIS MATTER NEEDS TO COME BACK YOU KNOW I'M ALL EARS I'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOUR FINDINGS ARE. THE IDEA OF AN AUDIT TYPICALLY AT LEAST IN MY OPINION. IS WHEN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE. ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION FROM THOSE WHO ARE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE HAVE TO RELY UPON. AN EXPERT AND IN HER TEAM TO COME OVER AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT -- ALL THE STONES ARE TURNED OVER BUT I THINK IN FROM YOUR STANDPOINT IT'S NOT THERE YET BUT IT MIGHT BE MOVING FORWARD SO I RESPECT. YOUR WISHES AND WILL ADDRESSES THAT. FUTURE TIME NOW. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. FIRST SENATOR RATHER THAN THEIR MONEY. YES -- I APPRECIATE -- SO CHAIR -- TO RAISE ISSUES TODAY -- I COME FROM LA. WE HAVE THE DIRTIEST AIR IN THE U. S.. MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR IS HIT ESPECIALLY HARD [inaudible] ALL. WERE FAMOUS FOR THE EXCITED. UP UP PROBLEMS. AS WAS TRIGGERED BY THE PARTICULAR LET OUT SPEED BY THE TRUCKS. THEY'RE PROBABLY FIVE SIX SEVEN FREEWAYS THAT CRISS CROSSED TO THROW MY DISTRICT. AND KIDS NORMALLY HAVE TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY OBAMA TO TREAT THEIR RESPECT RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES -- SO I KNOW WHAT. IT IS TO REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT NEEDS THE ATTENTION. NOW -- I WOULD OF LIKED THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE RAISING THAT AS WHAT IS. PERSONALLY ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU I WOULD HAVE LIKED A MUCH MORE. FOCUSED. ATTENTION BECAUSE I THINK A REPORT THAT ENCOMPASSES SO MANY ISSUES AS YOU HAVE REYES AND MAY NOT GET. TO BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO COVER SO MUCH GROUND MAY NOT GET. TO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE FOCUS SO. I WOULD HOPE YOU. WOULD CONSIDER RECONSIDER SOME OF THOSE SO THAT WE GIVE THE PROPER FOCUS AND ATTENTION IN A WAY THAT WE COULD REALLY GRAPPLE WITH IT. AND MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING IT WITH YOU ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES LIKE I SAID THEY AFFECT COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE. WHETHER IT'S NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL OR SOUTHERN -- AND MY INTENTION IS ONCE WE RECEIVE ANSWERS FOR ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND THE ONES POSE NODDED AS WELL FROM. THEY ARE BE THAT I'LL SHARE THAT WITH EVERY MEMBER THANK YOU SENATOR US OF SOME MONEY. THANK YOU. MISTER ACTING CHAIR MISTER CHAIR -- YOU ANSWERED MY QUESTION JUST THEN I WOULD APPRECIATE COPIES OF RESPONSES YOU RECEIVED FROM CAR -- TAKING IN. THE BIG PICTURE HERE -- THE WORK OF CAR IS TO CONTINUE TO PUSH. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. IN THE BROADER ISSUE IS CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTING THE PLANET. CALIFORNIA'S PROVEN TO BE A LEADER. IN SETTING GREENHOUSE -- GAS EMISSION REDUCTION. TIME TABLES AND YET WE KNOW THE IMPACTS IN CHANCES ARE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES -- BUT AS PART OF THE ONGOING WORK OF CARB -- THE RESPONSE TO THE EARLIER -- LA -- REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS. I THINK THE SOLUTION TODAY IN AGAIN CONTINGENT UPON. THE THOROUGHNESS OF THOSE RESPONSES. BUT I THINK IT ACTUALLY. HAS THE POTENTIAL OF EXPEDITING GETTING THIS INFORMATION TO YOU AND TO THE COMMITTEE -- IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM MISTER COREY MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION. IS. EXISTENCE AND IT'S A MATTER OF COMPILATION AND MAKING SURE IT'S IN IN THE MANNER THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'VE RAISED. BUT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL HERE I THINK OF A WIN WIN OF NOT HAVING. TO ABSORB THE COST OF AN ON IT THE AUDITOR'S SET UP TO DO THIS WORK BUT AS WE KNOW EVERY ON IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT TAKES TIME. SO WITH THE COOPERATION OF CARB -- IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE GET THE RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTIONS THAT YOU SEEK IN CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT POTENTIALLY IN A MORE EXPEDITIOUS MANNER -- AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER TO SHARE THE RESPONSES THE RECEIVE WITH THIS AND THANK YOU MISTER A VICE CHAIR ACTING CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN RESOLUTION OF THIS. THANKS IN MINING COLLEAGUES ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOLLOW UP DID YOU PRESENT THIS LIST AND JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE WE HAVE FOUR AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR REQUEST FOR NOT IT. WAS THIS LIST THAT YOU JUST READ PRESENTED TO THE BOARD AND REJECTED THEY WOULDN'T PROVIDE THE INFORMATION OR JUST THE FIRST AND THE HEARING IT SO THIS IS -- QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING A WORKING POLLUTED AIR FAMILIES MOST WHAT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED. TO LOOK AT THOSE AREAS BUT YOU KNOW THE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO IS ARE WE EVEN MONITORING THOSE AREAS. HAVE WE SEEN A GROWTH OR REGRESS IN THESE AREAS FOR THE MOST POLLUTED AREAS THESE ARE QUESTIONS I CAME UP WITH -- THIS MORNING AS I WAS -- CONTEMPLATING IT LAST NIGHT TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. ON THE AUDIT REQUESTS SPEAKING WITH MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- SO WE WILL BE SUBMITTING THOSE BUT BUT YOU KNOW HOW TO JAN OFTEN SUBMITTED TO THEM IS MY QUESTION WHETHER I I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE IS ALL THE MEMBERS AGREE. BECAUSE I READ THE QUESTIONS YEARS ONLY ONE QUESTION EVEN RELATES TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE OTHERS JUST SIMPLY -- BROAD QUESTIONS THAT RELATE TO THE PROGRAM IN ITS ENTIRETY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WAS YOUR OBJECTIVE MY ONLY SENSES THE SWITCH TO THIS AND DID THESE THE FOLKS. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND A WE HEAR BECAUSE THEY SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE THIS TO YOU AND YOU NEED TO GET IN ON IT OR HAD THIS THE FIRST INSTANCE WHERE THEY'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THESE QUESTIONS RIGHT. SO LET ME HELP FRAME THIS OF THE AUDIT WE KNOW A LOT OF THE POLLUTION THAT OCCURS IN THE GHG. THAT OCCURS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND PROPS AROUND THE WORLD IS BECAUSE OF TRANSPORTATION. RIGHT IT IS LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES THESE QUESTIONS IN THE AUDIT REPORT WERE DESIGNED AT THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT AFFECT. NOT ONLY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BUT SOUTH COAST LOS ANGELES. EVERY DISTRICT FOR EVERY MEMBER THAT'S REPRESENTED HERE TODAY. THE QUESTIONS LIKE I SAID I CAME UP WITH THIS MORNING I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT NEW QUESTIONS OR QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKING. FOR FOR YEARS BUT IF WE NEED TO PUT IT IN A LETTER FORMAT I'M PREPARED TO DO THAT AND SUBMIT THAT AND GIVE THE RESULTS TO THIS COMMITTEE INTO EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND IT ON THE ON THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE EXPENSE OF THE AUDIT THIS IS NOT THE MOST EXPENSIVE AUDIT. THAT THE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY APPROVED TODAY [inaudible] SIR. THANK YOU MAY A VICE CHAIR ROTH I'M LIKE SEVERAL COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE UP THE AIR WAS JUST MORE. OF A SUPPORT. I WANT TO A TO ASK YOU -- I KNOW THAT -- MRS ALICE IS GOING TO SIT. AND THAT YOU ARE GOING TO TRY YOUR BEST TO EASE RESPOND TO HIM -- IN WRITING -- SHOULD FOR WHATEVER REASON HE'S. NOT SATISFY WITH THOSE -- THOSE RESPONSE AND HE BRINGS THIS REQUEST -- BACK INTO THIS COMMITTEE HEARING AT A LATER DATE -- FROM YOUR POSITION AS AN AGENCY A WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED. TO THE STATE AUDITOR -- REVIEW YOUR A YOUR AGENCY. I THINK IT WOULD REALLY. IF IF THIS SCENARIO YOU JUST DESCRIBED PLAYED OUT AND WE WERE NOT RESPONSIVE. MAY THAT'S THE COMES BACK THIS COMMITTEE I WILL SIT ON THE SIDELINES BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE SPONSORED TO EACH OF THESE QUESTIONS. WERE -- I SO SO I WAS TOLD THAT AND AND AND AND AND NO I'M THE NEWEST KID ON IN THIS THIS GROUP [inaudible] YOUR BUT WE'LL GIVE YOU A SOMETIME -- AS AS A LET'S LIVE OF BODY WE DO HAVE -- OUR LET'S LIVE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND IS NOT THAT WE DON'T -- TRUSTS -- WHAT YOU WHAT YOU SAY -- WHAT GET THE REPORT BACK BUT IT IS GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR AND -- FOR THE REPUBLIC TO AT LEAST HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF ICE LOOK AT ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT -- YOU'VE BEEN DOING AND I ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT A CAR HAS BEEN DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE. BUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE LEADING THE YOUR PROGRAM IF OF THE MEAL IF IF EVERYTHING IS HUNKY DORY. I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION I GUESS MY FIRST RESPONSE WAS THAT AS I LOOKED AT THE QUESTION THE NATIONAL QUESTIONS I SAW NOT THESE ARE NEW ONES BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN BE EQUALLY RESPONSIVE TO THEM. MY RESPONSE WAS IF ONE CONSIDERED THE DATA THAT'S ALREADY OUT THERE THROUGH A SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE REPORTS ACTUALLY SO MIDDLE SOME OF WHICH ARE ANNUAL AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC PROCESS WE GO THROUGH. THAT WAS MY MAIN POINT WAS. THE INFORMATION'S IN THERE SO I COULDN'T HELP BUT ASK WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE AUDIT GOT IT.

EVERY REQUEST THAT CAME BEFORE US -- TODAY ON AND AND I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER A MEMBERS.
