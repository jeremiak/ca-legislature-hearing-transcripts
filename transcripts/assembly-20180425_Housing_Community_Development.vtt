HAVEN'T SEEN THE ACTUAL

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:16.014 region:rollup2

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:17.549 region:rollup2
TO SAY ONE WHERE THE OTHER

WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD BE OKAY

00:35:17.549 --> 00:35:21.553 region:rollup2
WITH THAT. OUR MAIN CONCERN IS

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:23.254 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THE ZONING

00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:25.023 region:rollup2

GENERAL PLAN ARE INCONSISTENT.

00:35:25.023 --> 00:35:28.059 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU WANT TO USE THE

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.994 region:rollup2
HIGHEST DENSITY IF DEVELOP ONCE

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:30.929 region:rollup2

US BUT WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.633 region:rollup2
IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE HOUSING

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:36.968 region:rollup2
ELEMENT. NOT THE LAND USE

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:38.937 region:rollup2
ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN IT'S

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:40.639 region:rollup2
TOO GENERAL IT'S OUT THIRTY

00:35:38.937 --> 00:35:42.207 region:rollup2
YEARS AND I THINK IT INVITES

00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:43.708 region:rollup2
SPRAWL IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY

00:35:42.207 --> 00:35:45.043 region:rollup2
CAREFUL BECAUSE. IF THE

00:35:45.043 --> 00:35:49.614 region:rollup2

00:35:50.949 --> 00:35:54.519 region:rollup2
PUSHING OUT AG LAND THAT WERE

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:56.521 region:rollup2
STILL WEAK CONSISTENT WITH S. B.

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:57.655 region:rollup2
THREE SEVENTY FIVE.

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:58.556 region:rollup2
.

00:35:57.655 --> 00:36:00.892 region:rollup2
FOR THE TRANSIT IS THE

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:02.794 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IS IT CETERA SO.

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:04.829 region:rollup2
IF IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LAND

00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:06.364 region:rollup2
USE ELEMENT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:08.400 region:rollup2
TO AGREE TO THAT IS JUST

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:09.467 region:rollup2
TO BROUGHT INTO GENERAL IT'S

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.069 region:rollup2
MEANT TO BE.

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:12.103 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT

00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:13.671 region:rollup2
WERE CONSISTENT WITH S. B. THREE

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:14.939 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE WHATEVER CHANGES

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:17.008 region:rollup2
ARE MADE TO THE BELL.

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:18.677 region:rollup2
ON THE ISSUE OF.

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:20.211 region:rollup2
ADVERSE IMPACT

00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:21.846 region:rollup2
THAT DEFINITION AND THERE WERE

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:23.348 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY SURE WHAT IT DOES

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:25.116 region:rollup2
IT'S AN INTENT LANGUAGE SECTION.

00:36:23.348 --> 00:36:25.950 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DAY THAT TERMS THAT

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:28.286 region:rollup2
ARE USED IN THERE ARE NOT

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.220 region:rollup2
DEFINED SO WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:31.022 region:rollup2
WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.991 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT CLEAR US EXACTLY

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:35.226 region:rollup2
WHAT IT DOES. ON AND WE DON'T

00:36:32.991 --> 00:36:35.827 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO DECIDE SO

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:38.029 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE MAIN ISSUES FOR

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:38.897 region:rollup2
US.

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:40.698 region:rollup2
CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE

00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:42.801 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:43.735 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ALSO IN OPPOSITION I'M

00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:45.036 region:rollup2
ALL JUST ECHO THE ISSUES THAT

00:36:43.735 --> 00:36:46.771 region:rollup2
APA BROUGHT UP REGARDING THE

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:48.139 region:rollup2
ADVERSE IMPACTS SECTION WE DO

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:50.108 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UNCLEAR

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:51.409 region:rollup2
NEW LANGUAGE. ADDED TO THE BILL

00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:53.411 region:rollup2
AND SO WHILE THE PROPONENTS

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:54.646 region:rollup2
ARGUING THAT THIS IS GOING TO

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:56.147 region:rollup2
INCREASE CLARITY WE THINK THAT

00:36:54.646 --> 00:36:57.415 region:rollup2
COURTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:58.783 region:rollup2
THROUGH LITIGATION TO FIGURE OUT

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.818 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE NEW PROVISIONS

00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:01.586 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MEAN.

00:36:59.818 --> 00:37:02.821 region:rollup2
SEE STOCK IS THE REPRESENTATIVE

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:04.622 region:rollup2
OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN

00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:06.224 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW COUNTIES

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:07.192 region:rollup2
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING AND

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:08.727 region:rollup2
ZONING FOR HOUSING IN THE

00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:10.128 region:rollup2
UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF THE

00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:11.129 region:rollup2
STATE. AND SO WHILE WE

00:37:10.128 --> 00:37:12.831 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT THE INTENT OF

00:37:11.129 --> 00:37:14.532 region:rollup2
THIS MIL BILL MIGHT BE FOCUSED

00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:16.301 region:rollup2
ON URBANIZED AREAS AND MAYBE

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:17.635 region:rollup2
INFILL PROJECTS WHERE. I'M

00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:19.471 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ZONING

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:21.206 region:rollup2
AND NOT BEING AS HIGH AS ALLOWED

00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:21.973 region:rollup2
IN THE GENERAL PLAN WE THINK

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:23.575 region:rollup2
THERE'S GONNA BE PERVERSE

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:25.844 region:rollup2
IMPACTS IN THE UNINCORPORATED

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:27.479 region:rollup2
AREAS OF THE STATE. WHERE ZONING

00:37:25.844 --> 00:37:29.581 region:rollup2
MAY ALLOW FOR LOW DENSITY

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:31.349 region:rollup2
HOUSING RIGHT NOW BUT BECAUSE OF

00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:33.551 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM DESIGNATION IN THE

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:35.720 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLAN THIS IS ALLOWING

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:36.621 region:rollup2
AND SOMEONE TO COME IN AND GET A

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.156 region:rollup2
PROJECT APPROVED? THAT'S

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:40.125 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT WITH THE UNDERLYING

00:37:38.156 --> 00:37:40.925 region:rollup2
ZONING ORDINANCE AND DOING

00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:42.293 region:rollup2

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:44.329 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR BROADER

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO WE

WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:59.277 region:rollup2
DENSITIES ON A PARCEL BY PARCEL

00:37:56.875 --> 00:38:01.112 region:rollup2
BASIS RATHER THAN JUST ASSUMING

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:03.281 region:rollup2
THAT ANY RURAL PARCEL THAT

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:04.249 region:rollup2
ALLOWS FOR SOME LEVEL OF

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:06.417 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT RIGHT

00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:07.652 region:rollup2

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.346 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRE THOSE FEES TO BE

SLIGHTLY AMENDED NOT ONE.

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.996 region:rollup2
GOT IT OKAY YEAH I THINK IT WAS

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.564 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVEL THAT IS REALLY HIGH

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.931 region:rollup2
NUMBERS THAT I HAVE A HARD TIME

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:10.066 region:rollup2
KEEPING UP WITH.

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:11.134 region:rollup2
.

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:12.402 region:rollup2
SO I THINK CERTAINTIES REALLY

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.870 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND I AND I KNOW OUR

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.871 region:rollup2

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.643 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.544 region:rollup2
ON THE FRONT BY EVE SPEC THAT AS

01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:21.244 region:rollup2
A CONSUMER NOTHING SHOULD BE

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:22.546 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:24.214 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT JURISDICTION'S

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:25.749 region:rollup2
SHOULD PUBLISH THESE I RECOMMEND

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.651 region:rollup2

SHIFT LATER BUT YOU KNOW THAT

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:34.124 region:rollup2
THE PIPELINE THING IN THAT

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:36.626 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE HELD SEPARATELY.

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:38.495 region:rollup2
I I I I GUESS THAT THAT THAT

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.029 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD BASS

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:41.064 region:rollup2

CLARITY ON ON THE AMENDMENTS.

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:44.768 region:rollup2
TO BE SUPER CLEAR COMMUNITY

SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:54.044 region:rollup2
THINK WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:54.945 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES TAKES TO GET A

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:57.948 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:59.216 region:rollup2
APPROVED OF BY DECISION BODY

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:00.383 region:rollup2

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:08.458 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE THE END GOAL YOUR

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.227 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE IN THIS ACTUALLY BUILD

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:12.028 region:rollup2
MORE HOUSING RIGHT AND TO REMOVE

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:13.763 region:rollup2
A DECISION MAKING BODIES ABILITY

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:15.265 region:rollup2

PROJECT TO PROVE. THAT WE WOULD

01:02:16.1000 --> 01:02:21.238 region:rollup2
WANT TO GIVE UP THAT OPPORTUNITY

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.072 region:rollup2

UTILITIES CRACKED SO THAT THE

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:32.649 region:rollup2
WHOLE IDEA IS.

WE'RE NOT TRYING TO AFFECT THE

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:35.352 region:rollup2
HOOK UPS ALL OF THAT SHOULD BE

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:36.786 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING IN

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:38.421 region:rollup2
ADDITION THERE THERE WAS A

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:40.590 region:rollup2

YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THAT

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:58.942 region:rollup2

EFFICIENT AND HOW WE BUILD

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:46.449 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICS OF

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.950 region:rollup2
BUILDING LARGER BUILDINGS THAT

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:49.251 region:rollup2

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:51.220 region:rollup2

SEVERAL APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN

AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:07.203 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS. EVEN THOUGH THAT THE

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:08.237 region:rollup2

ALL OF THOSE BUILDINGS ARE UNDER

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.907 region:rollup2
SIX STORIES BECAUSE OF THE

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.776 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS OF BUILDING THOSE

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:14.910 region:rollup2
LARGER BUILDINGS WHICH IN MY

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:17.413 region:rollup2
MIND WAS A REAL MISSED

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:19.015 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE NOT ONLY

01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:20.850 region:rollup2
MORE HOUSING AND MORE AFFORDABLE

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.851 region:rollup2
HOUSING BUT LARGER UNITS FOR THE

PEOPLE THAT ARE MOVING IN

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.053 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TO MAKE THOSE PRO.

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:25.521 region:rollup2
FORMAS WORK ON THE SHORTER

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:27.223 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS THEY REALLY HAVE TO

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:28.391 region:rollup2
CRAM THE UNITS AND AND THEY END

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:30.226 region:rollup2
UP WITH VERY SMALL UNITS WHICH

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:32.395 region:rollup2
AFFECTS BUT RESIDENTS QUALITY OF

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:33.763 region:rollup2
LIFE. AND WHAT WE END UP WITH

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:35.231 region:rollup2
LESS BE ABLE TO HOUSE LESS

01:15:33.763 --> 01:15:36.298 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE WE

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:38.634 region:rollup2
HAVE ALMOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:42.304 region:rollup2

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:44.140 region:rollup2
VERY AREA TO WORK SO WE HAVE THE

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:45.107 region:rollup2
GOAL IN THE STATE OF HAVING MORE

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.809 region:rollup2

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:53.382 region:rollup2
HURDLE THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:55.684 region:rollup2
FOR DEVELOPERS TO OVERCOME TO

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:58.154 region:rollup2
FULLY UTILIZE THE LAND THAT'S

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:59.255 region:rollup2
THERE IN THOSE AREAS. SO OUR

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:00.790 region:rollup2

01:15:59.255 --> 01:16:02.158 region:rollup2
INTERESTING CONCEPT FOR THAT I'D

LIKE HIM TO A TO TALK ABOUT AND

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:05.694 region:rollup2
I'LL TELL YOU WHY. WE FEEL THAT

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.463 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS BILL

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:09.131 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN HE'S FINISHED.

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:11.367 region:rollup2

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:51.874 region:rollup2
USED ACTUALLY IN TWELVE STATES

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:53.375 region:rollup2
AROUND THE U. S.. TO REDUCE AND

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:55.377 region:rollup2

STATIONS THE VERTICAL HOUSING

01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:04.987 region:rollup2
PROGRAM PROVIDES THE MISSING

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:05.521 region:rollup2
FINANCING TO PRODUCE SCORES OF

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:06.589 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE AND MARKET RATE

01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:07.656 region:rollup2

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:09.225 region:rollup2
WITHIN  GIVEN PROJECT THAT

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:10.693 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE BUILT

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:12.027 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THIS TOOL WHILE BRINGING

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:14.029 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THE PER UNIT

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:15.464 region:rollup2
COST DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY AND AT

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:17.833 region:rollup2
LEAST DOUBLING THE VALUE OF THE

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:19.468 region:rollup2
PROPERTY AYE IN UNDERLYING TAX

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:20.603 region:rollup2
BASIS COMPARED TO SIMILAR.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:22.605 region:rollup2
SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT.

01:17:20.603 --> 01:17:24.940 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE

01:17:22.605 --> 01:17:25.774 region:rollup2
PRODUCED UNDER THE STATUS QUO.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.276 region:rollup2
THIS PROVISION RIVER REFLECTS

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:28.744 region:rollup2
BOTH A HIGHER LEVEL OF

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:29.578 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE UNITS SET ASIDE

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:30.513 region:rollup2
WITHIN A GIVEN PROJECT.

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:32.481 region:rollup2
THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE

01:17:30.513 --> 01:17:34.016 region:rollup2
GENERATED AND DEEPER LEVEL OF

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:36.051 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY THAT IS REQUIRED

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:37.419 region:rollup2
UNDER CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:38.687 region:rollup2
DENSITY BONUS LAW AND THE BILL

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:40.122 region:rollup2
WOULD PRODUCE AFFORDABLE UNITS

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:41.991 region:rollup2
AT AROUND HALF OF THE COST OF

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:42.825 region:rollup2
WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:44.159 region:rollup2
DEVELOP ON THEIR OWN.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:45.227 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM PAYS FOR THE COST OF

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:46.962 region:rollup2
THE INCREASED DENSITY IS

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.897 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED IN

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:49.465 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ACCRUE TO DEVELOPER

01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:51.167 region:rollup2
PROFIT.

01:17:49.465 --> 01:17:52.902 region:rollup2
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN A HIGHER

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:54.503 region:rollup2
DENSITY PROJECT COSTS ROUGHLY

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:55.538 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT MORE PER SQUARE

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.806 region:rollup2
FOOT ON AVERAGE.

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:59.775 region:rollup2
THEN TO BUILD A LOWER DENSITY I

01:17:57.806 --> 01:18:01.510 region:rollup2
HOUSING PROJECT YET RENTS IN

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:03.078 region:rollup2
MANY PLACES EVEN AROUND TRANSIT

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:04.813 region:rollup2
ARE NOT THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.848 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE FOR THAT DENSER

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.415 region:rollup2
PROJECT TO MAKE.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.650 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL.

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:09.051 region:rollup2
SENSE

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:09.685 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN AFFORDABLE UNITS

01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:10.953 region:rollup2
ARE CONTEMPLATED AS PART OF THE

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:12.321 region:rollup2
PROJECT

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:14.056 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS IS FAR MORE

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:16.091 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY RATIONAL TO BUILD

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:17.593 region:rollup2
LOW DENSITY PROJECTS RATHER THAN

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:18.994 region:rollup2
HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS. NOW WHICH

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:20.763 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY COST LOCAL

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:21.830 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS MUCH NEEDED OUR

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:23.432 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX REVENUE.

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.867 region:rollup2
CONTACT DEVELOPMENT HOUSING

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:26.602 region:rollup2
UNITS IN FOR GOES THE PROP

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.836 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPMENT OF

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:30.172 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE UNITS ALTOGETHER.

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:31.006 region:rollup2
IN FACT RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:33.108 region:rollup2
WITHIN IN MANY AREAS AROUND THE

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:35.311 region:rollup2
STATE. WITHIN A HALF MILE RING

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:36.845 region:rollup2
AROUND TRANSIT WHO DID THAT THE

01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:38.380 region:rollup2
PRODUCERS OF MID RISE LOWER

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:40.082 region:rollup2
DENSITY APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.952 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PAY MORE FOR LAND AND.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:43.419 region:rollup2
THEN THE DEVELOPERS OF HIGH RISE

01:18:42.952 --> 01:18:47.489 region:rollup2
MORE UNIT.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:48.624 region:rollup2
LARGER APARTMENT BUILDINGS.

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:49.225 region:rollup2
IT'S OF THIS THIS VEHICLE THIS

01:18:48.624 --> 01:18:51.427 region:rollup2
TOOL PROVIDES A WAY FOR HIGH

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:52.328 region:rollup2
DENSITY PROJECTS TO PENCIL OUT.

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:54.296 region:rollup2
I LIKELY PROVIDING THE SAME

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:55.798 region:rollup2
RETURNS TO THE HOUSING PRODUCER

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:57.399 region:rollup2
AS WITH THE LESS EXPENSIVE LOWER

01:18:55.798 --> 01:18:59.034 region:rollup2
DENSITY PROJECT THAT DOESN'T

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:01.670 region:rollup2
OFFER THE SAME PUBLIC BENEFITS

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:02.938 region:rollup2
AS THIS INCREASED DENSITY WOULD.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.640 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THIS VEHICLE BRIDGES

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:06.041 region:rollup2
THE DELTA IN CREATES AN ECONOMIC

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.177 region:rollup2
RATIONALE FOR DEVELOPERS TO

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:09.144 region:rollup2
BUILD A HIGH DENSITY WALKABLE

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:11.013 region:rollup2
PROJECT TO REALIZE THE FULL

01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:12.481 region:rollup2
SUITE. OF PUBLIC BENEFITS

01:19:11.013 --> 01:19:14.016 region:rollup2
INCLUDING IN ADDITION TO THE

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:15.651 region:rollup2
QUANTITY QUALITY AND

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:17.319 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY BENEFITS ARE

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:18.954 region:rollup2
CREATING ADDITIONAL AYE JOB

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:20.189 region:rollup2
CREATION AND EMPLOYMENT INCOME.

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:21.590 region:rollup2
CAUSING DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN

01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:22.925 region:rollup2
VEHICLE TAILPIPE EMISSIONS

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:24.493 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE PROJECTS WOULD BE

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:26.295 region:rollup2
LOCATED NEAR TRANSIT STATIONS

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:27.563 region:rollup2
AND SERVING INCOMING POPULATIONS

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:29.365 region:rollup2
THROUGH ACCOMMODATE OF WHAT WE

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:31.066 region:rollup2
CALL IN PLACEMENT RATHER THAN

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:32.868 region:rollup2
THE DISRUPTIVE DISPLACEMENT. OF

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:35.004 region:rollup2
EXISTING POPULATIONS AND ON THAT

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:36.405 region:rollup2
LAST POINT THIS LEGISLATION ALSO

01:19:35.004 --> 01:19:37.940 region:rollup2
INCORPORATES IDENTICAL

DISPLACEMENT THROUGH DEMOLITION

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:46.015 region:rollup2
AND REDEVELOPMENT. WOULD ALSO

01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:47.716 region:rollup2
HELP IMPROVE I INVESTMENT IN

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:48.684 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY DIVESTED

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.718 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:19:48.684 --> 01:19:51.787 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM WOULD MAKE

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:53.922 region:rollup2
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING POLICIES

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:54.957 region:rollup2
MORE WORKABLE ACROSS THE STATE

PRODUCTION OF A CERTAIN KIND OF

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.330 region:rollup2
HOUSING QUICKLY BECOME JUST

01:20:00.062 --> 01:20:03.098 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BARRIER. TO PRODUCING

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:04.266 region:rollup2
ANY KIND OF HOUSING AT ALL.

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:06.168 region:rollup2
THE VERTICAL HOUSING PROGRAM

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:08.203 region:rollup2
PROVIDES OF A VIABLE FINANCING

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:10.039 region:rollup2
MODEL TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE ENABLE

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:12.174 region:rollup2
MORE UNITS THROUGH INCLUSIONARY

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:12.808 region:rollup2
HOUSING POLICIES THAT THAT THAT

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:14.209 region:rollup2
THOSE POLICIES WOULD OTHERWISE

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:16.211 region:rollup2
SEEK TO MANDATE.

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:18.280 region:rollup2
INTO REALITY AND FINALLY THE

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:20.049 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.717 region:rollup2
USE OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO

01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:23.018 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACHIEVE

01:20:21.717 --> 01:20:24.386 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY GOALS AND

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:25.187 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHES WHAT LOCAL

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:27.790 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WOULD TYPICALLY

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:28.991 region:rollup2
REQUIRE. DOUBLE THE CAPITAL TO

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:30.459 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE EITHER BY DELIVERING

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:32.127 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THEMSELVES WERE BY

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:33.329 region:rollup2
BUYING DOWN RENTS.

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:36.065 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

REPRESENTING BRIDGE HOUSING A

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.670 region:rollup2
BRIDGE HOUSING IS A NONPROFIT

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:43.439 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER I

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:45.040 region:rollup2
THAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY THAT

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.275 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE LARC. MANY OF THE

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.977 region:rollup2
LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:50.546 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IN THE STATE PRIMARILY

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:52.481 region:rollup2
INFILL AND IN URBAN AREAS.

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:54.683 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:55.784 region:rollup2
YET THE OFF THAT WE SUPPORT THE

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:56.318 region:rollup2

01:20:59.922 --> 01:21:03.892 region:rollup2
POST REDEVELOPMENT.

01:21:01.657 --> 01:21:05.728 region:rollup2
HAVING HOUSING INCREMENTS

.

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:15.564 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD

01:22:15.564 --> 01:22:19.134 region:rollup2
JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.836 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTANDING THIS IS

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:22.771 region:rollup2
FOR DISCUSSION ONLY.

01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:25.307 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WERE I THINK REALLY

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:27.142 region:rollup2
INTRIGUED BY THE CONCEPT OF

01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:28.377 region:rollup2
VERTICAL HOUSING. WITH OIL AND

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:29.578 region:rollup2
GROWING IN EXPENSIVE AND DOWN

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:31.413 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:22:29.578 --> 01:22:33.148 region:rollup2
EXPLORING VERTICAL HOUSING

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:34.216 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN HIGH TRANSIT AREAS

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.784 region:rollup2
I THINK MAKES A HIGH DEGREE OF

01:22:34.216 --> 01:22:37.586 region:rollup2
SENSE.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:39.254 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WORK CONCERNED WITH THIS

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:41.290 region:rollup2
SPELL AS YOU'VE BEEN CONCERNED

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:43.225 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER BILLS REGARDING

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:44.993 region:rollup2
BRINGING BACK SOME FORM OR

01:22:43.225 --> 01:22:46.428 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OF REDEVELOPMENT.

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:47.863 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE TWO THIRDS VOTER

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:50.199 region:rollup2
APPROVAL THRESHOLD.

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:51.733 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN EITHER

01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:53.802 region:rollup2
TAX INCREMENT FINANCING OR

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:55.170 region:rollup2
APPROVING BONDS AGAIN THIS IS

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.873 region:rollup2
NOT A FOREIGN POSITION FOR US WE

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:59.708 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED HERE LAST WEEK AGAINST

01:22:57.873 --> 01:23:00.776 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY THIRTY SEVEN AS WELL.

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:02.578 region:rollup2
ON THAT FRONT.

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:03.846 region:rollup2
I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE

01:23:02.578 --> 01:23:06.148 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH TAX INCREMENT

01:23:03.846 --> 01:23:07.349 region:rollup2
FINANCING AND MONEY BEING TAKEN

01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:09.284 region:rollup2
FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:10.652 region:rollup2
AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN BEING

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:12.821 region:rollup2
DIVERTED FOR SOME OTHER CAUSE.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:14.256 region:rollup2
HAVING THAT VOTER APPROVAL WHICH

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:16.158 region:rollup2
LASTS FAR BEYOND.

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:17.726 region:rollup2
THE DEBT THAT WAS APPROVED

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:20.162 region:rollup2
EITHER BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:21.163 region:rollup2
THE OTHER LOCAL ENTITY. AND NOT

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.763 region:rollup2
JUST MAKES AUDIT SENDS SPECIAL

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:23.932 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PROJECTS

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:25.467 region:rollup2
THAT COULD LAST THIRTY TO FORTY

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:27.236 region:rollup2
YEARS LONG AFTER THIS GOVERNMENT

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:28.170 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS ARE OUT OFF OUT OF

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:31.206 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:32.441 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION MEMBERS IT'S WORTHY

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:33.041 region:rollup2
TO NOTE HERE TO THAT AB TWENTY

01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:34.676 region:rollup2
FIVE FIFTY THREE ALSO INCLUDES

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:35.878 region:rollup2
AN ELEMENT OF INCLUSIONARY

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.712 region:rollup2
ZONING.

01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:38.580 region:rollup2
WHERE BEFORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:40.048 region:rollup2
AND YOU DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO BE

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.117 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZED BY THE BUILDER? IT'S

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:43.619 region:rollup2
WORTH NOTING THAT A RECENT STUDY

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:44.753 region:rollup2
ON INCLUSIONARY ZONING SHOWED

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:46.121 region:rollup2
THAT ONLY ELEVEN HUNDRED UNITS

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:47.556 region:rollup2
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WERE

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:50.292 region:rollup2
PRODUCED OVER THIRTY FIVE YEAR

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:51.260 region:rollup2
PERIOD. AND AT THAT RATE IT

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:51.860 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE AT LEAST A HUNDRED

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.829 region:rollup2
YEARS TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.163 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND WE WERE

01:23:53.829 --> 01:23:56.832 region:rollup2
JUST ARGUE THAT.

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:58.100 region:rollup2
WE LISTEN WE DO NEED AFFORDABLE

01:23:56.832 --> 01:23:59.268 region:rollup2
HOUSING WE NEED TO BE BUILDING A

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:01.169 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND

01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:03.005 region:rollup2
UNITS OF NEW HOUSING YEAR WERE

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:05.007 region:rollup2
ONLY BUILDING HALF THAT. AGAIN

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:06.508 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL IS INTRIGUING BUT

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:07.876 region:rollup2
INCLUDING AN INCLUSIONARY ZONING

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:09.912 region:rollup2
PIECE JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:11.113 region:rollup2
BEST WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:13.382 region:rollup2
THANKS.

01:24:11.113 --> 01:24:14.616 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER OPPOSITION.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:17.753 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:20.255 region:rollup2
ANY COMMENTS.

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:21.690 region:rollup2
I WILL FIRST THANK THE AUTHOR

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:24.326 region:rollup2
FOR BRINGING FORTH THE BIG IDEA.

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:25.794 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING

01:24:24.326 --> 01:24:26.395 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME DURING THE WORST

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:28.263 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:30.399 region:rollup2
HISTORY. I THINK THIS IS A VERY

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:31.800 region:rollup2
INTRIGUING IDEA IT'S A NEW IDEA

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:33.969 region:rollup2
FOR FOR MANY OF US.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.537 region:rollup2
AND I'LL JUST SAY CASE FOLKS

01:24:33.969 --> 01:24:36.905 region:rollup2
ARE WONDERING OF THE AUTHOR

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:38.941 region:rollup2
KNIGHT HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:40.442 region:rollup2
AND HAD AGREED IN CONCEPT ON A

01:24:38.941 --> 01:24:41.777 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF. POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:43.111 region:rollup2
BUT GIVEN THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:44.279 region:rollup2
OF HAD TO THREAD NOT JUSTICE

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:45.581 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BUT ALSO COMMITTEE

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:48.083 region:rollup2
STARTING AT ONE THIRTY THIS

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:49.952 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON WITH. AMENDMENTS THAT.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:51.019 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE HAD MORE STAFF.

01:24:49.952 --> 01:24:52.487 region:rollup2
WORKING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:53.455 region:rollup2
LIKELY UNABLE TO PULL TOGETHER

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:55.424 region:rollup2
BY THEN.

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:57.059 region:rollup2
I THINK WE DECIDED TO START THE

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:58.627 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ARE AND HOPEFULLY

01:24:57.059 --> 01:24:59.261 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THIS YEAR TO

01:24:58.627 --> 01:25:01.463 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:02.297 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION NEXT

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:04.166 region:rollup2
YEAR WITH THE AUTHOR ALDOUS LAY

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:04.833 region:rollup2
OUT A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT WERE

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:07.803 region:rollup2
LAID OUT IN THE COMMITTEE

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:08.437 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS AND. SINCE IS THE FIRST

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:09.004 region:rollup2
TIME I'VE HAD TO ENGAGE WITH THE

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:10.672 region:rollup2
SPONSOR.

01:25:09.004 --> 01:25:11.406 region:rollup2
NO I THINK FIRST OF WE ARE VERY

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:12.975 region:rollup2
SCARCE.

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:14.509 region:rollup2
PUBLIC DOLLARS TO INVEST IN

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:15.477 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:17.346 region:rollup2
AND.

01:25:15.477 --> 01:25:19.381 region:rollup2
I THINK THE IDEA THAT SOME OF

01:25:17.346 --> 01:25:21.116 region:rollup2
THESE DOLLARS MIGHT GO TO

01:25:19.381 --> 01:25:22.951 region:rollup2
SUPPORT MARKET RATE HOUSING IT'S

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.619 region:rollup2
INTRIGUING BUT VERY MUCH A NEW

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:25.487 region:rollup2
CONCEPT.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:27.189 region:rollup2
GIVEN HOW FEW DOLLARS WE HAVE

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:29.324 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD DEVOTE TO A

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:29.658 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THAT IS AN

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.660 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT.

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:32.761 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR AND I HAD DISCUSSED.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.663 region:rollup2
.

01:25:32.761 --> 01:25:36.898 region:rollup2
SECONDLY THE THIRTY FIVE YEAR

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:38.333 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY HOW THAT.

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:39.334 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT WE WOULD

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:40.836 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY BE DOING THIS FOR

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:43.305 region:rollup2
THREE AND A HALF DECADES WAS

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:45.040 region:rollup2
ALSO A DIFFERENT ISSUE RELATED

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:46.475 region:rollup2
TO THAT TEN. OF LOVE TO GET SOME

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.342 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT AND THEN

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:50.012 region:rollup2
THIRDLY.

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:51.513 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE

01:25:50.012 --> 01:25:53.148 region:rollup2
WHERE THE SUBSIDIES WOULDN'T BE

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:55.017 region:rollup2
NECESSARY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:57.753 region:rollup2
DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO DOWNTOWN

01:25:55.017 --> 01:25:59.388 region:rollup2
LA DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO. ARE

01:25:57.753 --> 01:26:00.489 region:rollup2
OAKLAND SAN JOSE YOU WOULDN'T

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:02.290 region:rollup2
NEED THE SUBSIDIES

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:03.925 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING IN

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:05.127 region:rollup2
THE BILL AS DRAFTED THAT CREATED

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:07.229 region:rollup2
THAT DISTINCTION SO.

01:26:05.127 --> 01:26:08.597 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN YOU WOULD

WANT TO AND SENT HOUSING.

01:26:08.597 --> 01:26:11.400 region:rollup2
CREATION THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:13.735 region:rollup2
BE INCENTIVE

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.604 region:rollup2
FIGURED OUT THAT FINE BALANCES.

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:16.872 region:rollup2
IS A CONCEPT I THINK WE NEED TO

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:17.672 region:rollup2
TO WRAP AROUND SO IF YOU HAVE

01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:19.775 region:rollup2

CONVERSATION.

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:24.079 region:rollup2
ON THIS INNOVATIVE IDEA.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:26.214 region:rollup2

REPRESENT ONE OF THE GROUND

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:06.374 region:rollup2
ZEROES OF THE HOUSING CRISIS

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.577 region:rollup2
BEING LOS. ANGELES.

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:11.179 region:rollup2
AND THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOODS

01:29:08.577 --> 01:29:12.881 region:rollup2
ARE AROUND IT. AND SEE EVERY

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:14.649 region:rollup2
SINGLE DAY THE IMPACT OF NOT

01:29:12.881 --> 01:29:16.051 region:rollup2
JUST WHAT'S HAPPENED WHEN CITIES

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:18.453 region:rollup2
REFUSE TO BUILD BUT ALSO THE

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:19.821 region:rollup2
RESULT OF MANY YEARS OF POLICIES

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:21.723 region:rollup2
BUT THE LOCAL ON THE STATE LEVEL

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:22.724 region:rollup2

OF HOUSING THE RESULTS IN AND.

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:25.327 region:rollup2
SO IN A LOT OF WAYS I FEEL LIKE

01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:26.461 region:rollup2
WE'VE GONE BACKWARDS WHAT WE

01:29:25.327 --> 01:29:28.897 region:rollup2
REALLY SHOULD BE DOING IS

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:31.433 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WHAT WE WANT WE WANT

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:32.934 region:rollup2
LARGER. TALLER INFILL NEAR

01:29:31.433 --> 01:29:34.369 region:rollup2
TRANSIT IN NEAR JOBS AND A LOT

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:36.137 region:rollup2
OF THESE COMMUNITIES SO HOW DO

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:37.839 region:rollup2
WE GET THERE AND THIS BILL IS

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:39.107 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY GET US THAT

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:40.408 region:rollup2
TYPE OF HOUSING AS OPPOSED TO

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:41.710 region:rollup2
PUTTING IN. A BUNCH OF

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:43.144 region:rollup2
STIPULATIONS AND JUST SEEING

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:44.279 region:rollup2
WHAT WE GET I THINK WE NEED TO

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:45.714 region:rollup2
WORK FROM OUTSIDE AND WORK

01:29:44.279 --> 01:29:46.882 region:rollup2
BACKWARDS AND TO YOUR QUESTION

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.183 region:rollup2
IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THESE ARE

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:49.718 region:rollup2
IN THE AREAS WE WANT THEM. I

01:29:48.183 --> 01:29:51.887 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE DO THE SAME THING

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:53.154 region:rollup2
WE ASK OUR MUNICIPALITIES AND WE

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.322 region:rollup2

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:57.659 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES WHO WANT TO TAKE

01:29:55.824 --> 01:29:59.461 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THIS. TO IDENTIFY

01:29:57.659 --> 01:30:00.962 region:rollup2
THOSE AREAS THAT COULD BOOST

01:29:59.461 --> 01:30:02.130 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FOR THIS TYPE OF GROWTH

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:03.932 region:rollup2
LET THE PLANNERS DO THEIR WORK

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:04.599 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY REALLY TRYING TO

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:06.835 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE THIS AND WHERE IS THE

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:09.070 region:rollup2
MARKET UNABLE TO PROVIDE THAT

01:30:06.835 --> 01:30:10.872 region:rollup2
HOUSING BEAT BECAUSE OF. THE THE

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:13.141 region:rollup2
REALITIES OF THE AREA THE

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:15.410 region:rollup2
FINANCING THE TYPE OF AREA THAT

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:17.045 region:rollup2
IT CURRENTLY IS SO THAT THEY CAN

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:18.513 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED A DIFFERENT FUTURE

THOSE AND LET THIS WORK IN THOSE

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:25.854 region:rollup2
AREAS. BUT EXCLUDING AREAS WHERE

01:30:24.686 --> 01:30:28.023 region:rollup2
THE MARKET HAS SHOWN THAT IT'S

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:29.324 region:rollup2
ALREADY ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN

01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:30.692 region:rollup2

01:30:29.324 --> 01:30:31.726 region:rollup2
MARKET TAKES OVER AND BECAUSE

01:30:30.692 --> 01:30:32.827 region:rollup2

THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL WORK

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:41.102 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO GO INTO

OF TAX DEDUCTIONS.

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:16.124 region:rollup2

01:38:16.124 --> 01:38:18.693 region:rollup2
FOR NEARLY ALL LOW INCOME

HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROJECTS THE

CAPITAL ACCOUNT STARTS VERY

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.562 region:rollup2
HIGH.

01:38:20.428 --> 01:38:22.764 region:rollup2
AS THE TAX CREDIT INVESTOR

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.998 region:rollup2
LIMITED PARTNER MAKES ITS

01:38:22.764 --> 01:38:25.366 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIRST YEAR

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:26.667 region:rollup2
TO. AND SLOPES DOWNWARD OVER

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:27.135 region:rollup2
TIME AS THE PARTNER TAKES

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:28.436 region:rollup2
INTEREST DEPRECIATION

DEDUCTIONS.

01:38:28.436 --> 01:38:30.838 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THAT THE ACCRUING

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:31.539 region:rollup2
INTEREST ON EACH CD LOAN IS

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.840 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL

01:38:31.539 --> 01:38:34.675 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIONS REDUCES THE CAPITAL

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.110 region:rollup2
COUNTS.

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:37.211 region:rollup2
IN MOST THE PROJECT TO WORK ON

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:38.713 region:rollup2
OUR STATE CAPITOL COUNTS ARE NOT

01:38:37.211 --> 01:38:40.515 region:rollup2
AN OBSTACLE.

01:38:38.713 --> 01:38:41.349 region:rollup2
BUT FOR SMALL AND I WANT TO SEE

01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:43.217 region:rollup2
A GROWING NUMBER OF PROJECTS

01:38:41.349 --> 01:38:44.719 region:rollup2
THEY APPEAR TO BE.

01:38:43.217 --> 01:38:46.320 region:rollup2
IF ANY POINT IN A TAX CREDIT

01:38:44.719 --> 01:38:48.189 region:rollup2
PARTNERS CAPITAL CAN'T REACHES

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.224 region:rollup2
ZERO DURING THE FIFTEEN YEAR TAX

01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:50.758 region:rollup2
CREDIT WE CAPTURE PERIOD. ONE OF

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:52.026 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS MUST GENERALLY

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:53.094 region:rollup2
HAPPENS.

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:54.862 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS AT THE PARTNER MUST

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:56.697 region:rollup2
STOP TAKING ANYMORE THE PROMISED

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:58.199 region:rollup2
TAX CREDITS OR DEDUCTIONS.

01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:59.767 region:rollup2
AND LESSEN UNTIL THEIR CAPITAL

01:38:58.199 --> 01:39:00.968 region:rollup2
COUNTY COMES POSITIVE AGAIN.

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:02.069 region:rollup2
IF THIS OCCURS DURING ELEVEN

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:03.271 region:rollup2
YEAR PERIOD DURING WHICH THE LOW

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:04.739 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT IS

01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:05.706 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED.

01:39:04.739 --> 01:39:07.642 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKELY BE CATASTROPHIC FOR

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:09.177 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT.

01:39:07.642 --> 01:39:10.077 region:rollup2
THE SECOND POSSIBILITY IS THAT

01:39:09.177 --> 01:39:11.512 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT IS GENERATED WAS

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:12.814 region:rollup2
CALLED MINIMUM GAIN WHICH IS A

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:14.115 region:rollup2
POSITIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:39:12.814 --> 01:39:16.050 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TAX BASIS. AT

01:39:14.115 --> 01:39:17.251 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING DEBT.

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:18.286 region:rollup2
YOU'RE CONTINUE TAKING THE LOW

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:19.821 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSING CREDITS AND

01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:20.388 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIONS EVEN THOUGH DOING SO

01:39:19.821 --> 01:39:21.956 region:rollup2
MAKES THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT GO

01:39:20.388 --> 01:39:22.990 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE.

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:23.791 region:rollup2
NOW THE WORDS THE BENEFITS

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.725 region:rollup2
INVESTOR HAS TAKEN OUT OF THE

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:26.627 region:rollup2
PROJECT EXCEED WHAT THEY'VE

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:28.029 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTED.

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:29.463 region:rollup2
THE SECOND OUTCOMES CERTAINLY

01:39:28.029 --> 01:39:29.997 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN THE FIRST HOWEVER IT

01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:31.432 region:rollup2
HAS ANOTHER QUITE NEGATIVE

01:39:29.997 --> 01:39:32.733 region:rollup2
OUTCOME.

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:34.435 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE TAX CREDIT INVESTOR

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:35.803 region:rollup2
CAN EXIT THE PROJECT THE PROJECT

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:37.271 region:rollup2
CAN BE RETURNED TO THE SPONSOR.

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:38.206 region:rollup2
TAXES MUST BE PAID ON THE

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:39.941 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE CAPITAL ACCOUNT THE

01:39:38.206 --> 01:39:42.176 region:rollup2
EXTRA BENEFITS.

01:39:39.941 --> 01:39:43.377 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:44.946 region:rollup2
WHEN THE OPERATION OF THE

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:46.514 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT SPONSOR TYPICALLY HAS

01:39:44.946 --> 01:39:47.048 region:rollup2
THE OPTION TO REPURCHASE THE

01:39:46.514 --> 01:39:48.983 region:rollup2
PROJECT FROM A TAX CREDIT

01:39:47.048 --> 01:39:50.551 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP. INSECT BITE OF THE

TAX CREDIT INVESTOR.

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:53.087 region:rollup2
THE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PAY.

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:54.455 region:rollup2
TAXES

01:39:53.087 --> 01:39:55.089 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF A TAX CREDIT

INVESTOR ON THE NEGATIVE CAPITAL

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:57.658 region:rollup2
COUNT.

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:59.460 region:rollup2
THOSE ACCOUNTS ARE GONE NEGATIVE

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.061 region:rollup2
BY TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.762 region:rollup2
WHICH IS NOT BE DIFFICULT TO

01:40:00.061 --> 01:40:03.130 region:rollup2
SPONSOR. USUALLY NONPROFIT

01:40:01.762 --> 01:40:04.198 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT MIGHT HAVE TO COME OUT

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:05.266 region:rollup2
OF POCKET I HAVE MILLION TO

TAX CODE PARTNERSHIP.

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:12.740 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY ON BOTH OF THESE

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:14.408 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AS CONSULTANTS

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:16.077 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES WE DO OUR BEST TO

I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:07.929 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE IT'S

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:10.364 region:rollup2
GREATLY EXACERBATED BY RECENT

01:41:07.929 --> 01:41:12.199 region:rollup2

PRICING.

01:41:21.876 --> 01:41:24.745 region:rollup2
LOWER PRICING MAKES CAPITAL

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:26.280 region:rollup2
CAMPERVANS WORSE.

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:27.715 region:rollup2
TAX REFORM ALSO EFFECTIVELY TOOK

01:41:39.327 --> 01:41:42.029 region:rollup2
EXERT NEGATIVE PRESSURE AND

01:41:40.328 --> 01:41:43.364 region:rollup2
CAPITAL ACCOUNTS.

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:44.465 region:rollup2
HIGHER COSTS MEANS DEVELOPERS

01:41:43.364 --> 01:41:45.766 region:rollup2
ALSO GENERALLY A BIGGER FUNDING

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:46.701 region:rollup2
GAPS

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:48.202 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS WE NEED MORE MONEY

01:41:46.701 --> 01:41:49.971 region:rollup2
FROM EIGHT CD.

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:50.471 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY FOR MAKE CITY OUGHT

INTEREST.

01:41:51.372 --> 01:41:57.244 region:rollup2
ALSO HURTS THE CAPITAL ACCOUNTS.

01:41:56.010 --> 01:41:58.479 region:rollup2

01:57:32.445 --> 01:57:35.949 region:rollup2
A CONCEPT THAT HASN'T REALLY

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:37.651 region:rollup2
BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT.

01:57:35.949 --> 01:57:38.885 region:rollup2
OF EIGHTY USE AND I DO WANT TO

01:57:37.651 --> 01:57:40.387 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE LAND USE

01:57:38.885 --> 01:57:41.955 region:rollup2
RELATED PROVISIONS IN THE BILL

01:57:40.387 --> 01:57:44.557 region:rollup2
AS EVERYONE KNOWS IN TWENTY

01:57:41.955 --> 01:57:45.959 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN WE PASSED TWO MAJOR LAWS

01:57:44.557 --> 01:57:47.060 region:rollup2
OVERHAULING EXCESS REDRAWING

01:57:45.959 --> 01:57:48.261 region:rollup2
UNIT LAW.

01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:50.297 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST BECAME EFFECTIVE IN

01:57:48.261 --> 01:57:52.065 region:rollup2
JUNE I'M SORRY JANUARY TWENTY

01:57:50.297 --> 01:57:54.501 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN SO LOCAL AGENCIES ARE

01:57:52.065 --> 01:57:56.136 region:rollup2
NOW AT THE TAIL END OF UPDATING

01:57:54.501 --> 01:57:58.338 region:rollup2
THEIR ORDINANCES AND HERE WE ARE

01:57:56.136 --> 01:58:00.440 region:rollup2
AGAIN. REWRITING THE CODE IN A

01:57:58.338 --> 01:58:01.574 region:rollup2
VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY I'M I WANT

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:03.710 region:rollup2
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:05.712 region:rollup2
IMPACT SPECIFICALLY ON COUNTIES

01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:07.681 region:rollup2
WHERE I THINK SOME OF THIS BILL.

01:58:05.712 --> 01:58:09.449 region:rollup2
IS REALLY FOCUSED ON URBAN AREAS

01:58:07.681 --> 01:58:11.584 region:rollup2
AND NOT THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS

01:58:09.449 --> 01:58:13.219 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE MIGHT BE REASONS FOR

01:58:11.584 --> 01:58:13.787 region:rollup2
A SORT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:15.021 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS

01:58:13.787 --> 01:58:16.389 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:17.991 region:rollup2
THE SIZE OF THESE UNITS IN

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:20.026 region:rollup2
UNINCORPORATED AREAS IS GONNA

01:58:17.991 --> 01:58:21.361 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE MUCH LARGER AND SO

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:23.096 region:rollup2
THE IMPACTS ON INFRASTRUCTURE

01:58:21.361 --> 01:58:25.031 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO BE

01:58:23.096 --> 01:58:25.632 region:rollup2
GREATER FOR INSTANCE PLASTER

01:58:25.031 --> 01:58:26.633 region:rollup2
COUNTY RIGHT UP THE HILL FROM

01:58:25.632 --> 01:58:28.802 region:rollup2
US.

01:58:26.633 --> 01:58:30.837 region:rollup2
ALLOWS TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET

01:58:28.802 --> 01:58:32.005 region:rollup2
OF EXCESS THREE RESIDENTIAL USES

01:58:30.837 --> 01:58:33.707 region:rollup2
SO THAT COULD INCLUDING EIGHTY

01:58:32.005 --> 01:58:36.309 region:rollup2
YOU ARE GARAGE AT CETERA AND

01:58:33.707 --> 01:58:37.444 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE MINIMUM SIZE ALLOWED.

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:40.013 region:rollup2
IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP TO NO

01:58:37.444 --> 01:58:41.081 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ON SIZE FOR

01:58:40.013 --> 01:58:42.916 region:rollup2
ACCESSORY RESIDENTIAL USES

01:58:41.081 --> 01:58:45.251 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A LARGER PARCEL.

01:58:42.916 --> 01:58:47.354 region:rollup2
ONE OTHER ISSUE FOR US IN TERMS

01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:48.788 region:rollup2
OF THE LIMITATIONS ON

01:58:47.354 --> 01:58:50.423 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ON PARCEL SIZE IS

01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:51.992 region:rollup2
AN UNINCORPORATED AREAS YOU HAVE

01:58:50.423 --> 01:58:53.326 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE

01:58:51.992 --> 01:58:54.494 region:rollup2
SEWER AND WATER SERVICE. SO BY

01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:57.163 region:rollup2
JUST

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:58.832 region:rollup2
STRIKING THE ABILITY TO USE

01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:59.1000 region:rollup2
PARCEL SIZE IS A SCREENING

01:58:58.832 --> 01:59:00.567 region:rollup2
CRITERIA FOR WHETHER AND EIGHTY

01:58:59.1000 --> 01:59:01.768 region:rollup2
YOU CAN STATE ON A PARCEL OR

01:59:00.567 --> 01:59:02.602 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:59:01.768 --> 01:59:04.237 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO FORCE PEOPLE

01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:05.171 region:rollup2
INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY GET

01:59:04.237 --> 01:59:06.506 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE

01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:07.741 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND THEN

01:59:06.506 --> 01:59:09.809 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY GO TO TRY TO PULL

01:59:07.741 --> 01:59:10.877 region:rollup2
THEIR WELL OR SEPTIC PERMIT.

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:12.245 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:14.147 region:rollup2
GET THE UNIT APPROVED SO I DON'T

01:59:12.245 --> 01:59:15.348 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S A POLICY OUTCOME

01:59:14.147 --> 01:59:15.982 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:18.051 region:rollup2
SEE.

01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:19.519 region:rollup2
FINALLY I JUST WANT TO POINT

01:59:18.051 --> 01:59:21.454 region:rollup2
OUT THAT THERE'S A VERY

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:22.789 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE

01:59:21.454 --> 01:59:25.358 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF THE BILL WHICH IS

01:59:22.789 --> 01:59:27.060 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE INSTEAD OF AS THE

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:28.995 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN LIES DEAD. TO

01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:30.964 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THE AREAS WHERE EIGHTY

01:59:28.995 --> 01:59:31.898 region:rollup2
USE ARE PERMITTED THE LAW WOULD

01:59:30.964 --> 01:59:33.566 region:rollup2
NOW CHANGED TO REQUIRE THE

01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:34.567 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE SO BASICALLY THE

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:36.269 region:rollup2
ORDINANCE WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:59:34.567 --> 01:59:38.038 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY RE WRITTEN TO SAY

01:59:36.269 --> 01:59:39.939 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY ARE EXCLUDED AND SO

01:59:38.038 --> 01:59:41.408 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS.

01:59:39.939 --> 01:59:42.776 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WITH THE PROVISIONS

01:59:41.408 --> 01:59:44.844 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD SEEK TO LIMIT THE

01:59:42.776 --> 01:59:46.780 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO PRECLUDE EIGHTY USE

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:48.681 region:rollup2
IN AREAS THAT MIGHT HAVE HIGH

01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:50.583 region:rollup2
FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY OR OTHER

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:52.786 region:rollup2
ISSUES LIKE THAT BY IMPOSING A

01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:54.287 region:rollup2
STANDARD. THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT

01:59:52.786 --> 01:59:55.522 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER PARTS OF LAND USE LAW

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:57.090 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE PREPONDERANCE OF

01:59:55.522 --> 01:59:58.892 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE VERSUS THE SUBSTANTIAL

01:59:57.090 --> 02:00:00.560 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE STANDARD SERVER THESE

01:59:58.892 --> 02:00:02.695 region:rollup2
REASONS AND MANY MORE OUTLINES

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:03.897 region:rollup2
ARE LETTERS AYE WE REMAIN

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:05.699 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO THE BILL.

02:00:03.897 --> 02:00:06.1000 region:rollup2

DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER LEGALIZING

02:02:19.966 --> 02:02:23.069 region:rollup2

SOME HEADWAY BUT NOW THERE'S

02:02:27.273 --> 02:02:30.376 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION NOW THAT EVERYONE

THE ALICE ACT TO WAS CREATED TO

02:10:36.362 --> 02:10:39.398 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN

02:10:37.496 --> 02:10:40.132 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE.

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:41.934 region:rollup2
I HARDLY REMEMBER NINETEEN

02:10:40.132 --> 02:10:43.636 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE MYSELF.

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:45.905 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS CREATED TO ADDRESS A

02:10:43.636 --> 02:10:48.474 region:rollup2
VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE AND RENT

02:10:45.905 --> 02:10:49.108 region:rollup2
CONTROL JURISDICTIONS TO ALLOW

02:10:48.474 --> 02:10:54.613 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS TO ALL TENANTS IN THE

02:10:49.108 --> 02:10:56.649 region:rollup2

02:10:54.613 --> 02:10:58.250 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH THAT.

02:10:56.649 --> 02:11:00.019 region:rollup2
HOWEVER OVER THE YEARS SOME

02:10:58.250 --> 02:11:01.854 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS HAVE EXPLOITED THE ACT

02:11:00.019 --> 02:11:03.489 region:rollup2
AND USE IT AS A TOOL TO AVOID

02:11:01.854 --> 02:11:05.358 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RENT

02:11:03.489 --> 02:11:06.559 region:rollup2
CONTROL LAWS.

02:11:05.358 --> 02:11:08.160 region:rollup2
THE ELLIS ACT EXPRESSLY

02:11:06.559 --> 02:11:09.762 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS WITHDRAWING LESS THAN

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:11.530 region:rollup2
ALL THE UNITS IN THE BUILDING

02:11:09.762 --> 02:11:13.065 region:rollup2
FROM THE RENTAL MARKET.

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:14.800 region:rollup2
AND THE LAW INDICATES THAT THERE

02:11:13.065 --> 02:11:15.901 region:rollup2
IS ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.703 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING

02:11:15.901 --> 02:11:19.672 region:rollup2
RENTAL AMOUNTS

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:20.940 region:rollup2
WHEN UNITS. ARE RE OFFERED FOR

02:11:19.672 --> 02:11:23.376 region:rollup2
RENT

02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:25.177 region:rollup2
THIS ALL GETS VERY TECHNICAL BUT

02:11:23.376 --> 02:11:25.745 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALSO LANGUAGE GOVERNING

02:11:25.177 --> 02:11:27.246 region:rollup2
THE TENTH LEAST TERMINATION

02:11:25.745 --> 02:11:28.814 region:rollup2
DATE.

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:31.150 region:rollup2
THAT SOME LANDLORDS HAVE

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:33.252 region:rollup2
INTERPRETED AS ALLOWING MULTIPLE

02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:34.553 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL DATES IN ADDITION

02:11:33.252 --> 02:11:36.789 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO PROVISION THAT

02:11:34.553 --> 02:11:38.357 region:rollup2
SPECIFIES THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE

02:11:36.789 --> 02:11:40.025 region:rollup2
DAY. THAT APPLIES IF THE

02:11:38.357 --> 02:11:41.927 region:rollup2
PROPERTY IS PUT BACK ON THE

02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:43.696 region:rollup2
RENTAL MARKET.

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:45.431 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WAS INTENDED BY

02:11:43.696 --> 02:11:46.766 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL LAW.

02:11:45.431 --> 02:11:48.534 region:rollup2
SOME LANDLORDS HAVE TAKEN

02:11:46.766 --> 02:11:50.636 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THIS CONFUSION BY

02:11:48.534 --> 02:11:52.371 region:rollup2
REMOVING UNITS FROM THE RENTAL

02:11:50.636 --> 02:11:54.273 region:rollup2
MARKET. AND RETURNING THEM IN A

02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:56.575 region:rollup2
PIECEMEAL FASHION AS

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:58.978 region:rollup2
UNCONTROLLED UNITS TO AVOID THE

02:11:56.575 --> 02:12:00.813 region:rollup2
ACT'S RESTRICTIONS AND EVADE

02:11:58.978 --> 02:12:02.047 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL GOING FORWARD.

02:12:00.813 --> 02:12:03.649 region:rollup2
SOME OF APPLY DIFFERENT

02:12:02.047 --> 02:12:06.085 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL DATES TO DIFFERENT

02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:08.320 region:rollup2
UNITS AND CLAIMED THAT RETURNING

02:12:06.085 --> 02:12:09.688 region:rollup2
ONE UNIT TO THE MARKET. DOES NOT

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.625 region:rollup2
OBLIGATE THE LANDLORD TO RE

02:12:09.688 --> 02:12:16.162 region:rollup2
OFFER ANY OTHER UNITS TO FORMER

02:12:12.625 --> 02:12:17.329 region:rollup2
TENANTS AGAIN AS THE ACTOR OF OF

02:12:16.162 --> 02:12:18.864 region:rollup2
OF REQUIRES.

02:12:17.329 --> 02:12:21.434 region:rollup2
THIS ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO

02:12:18.864 --> 02:12:22.635 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAW LESS THAN

02:12:21.434 --> 02:12:23.903 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE UNITS FROM THE RENTAL

02:12:22.635 --> 02:12:25.604 region:rollup2
MARKET.

02:12:23.903 --> 02:12:28.274 region:rollup2
AND IN EFFECT NEVER ACTUALLY

02:12:25.604 --> 02:12:30.376 region:rollup2
LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET AT ALL.

02:12:28.274 --> 02:12:32.278 region:rollup2
OF WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF THREE

EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THINGS

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:04.343 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD.

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:05.311 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS

02:15:29.955 --> 02:15:32.324 region:rollup2
.

02:15:31.423 --> 02:15:33.959 region:rollup2
YEAH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:35.327 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL AND

02:15:33.959 --> 02:15:37.029 region:rollup2
SO I DO I DO I THINK IT'S

02:15:35.327 --> 02:15:38.163 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WHAT MISTER BLOOM JUST

02:15:37.029 --> 02:15:40.432 region:rollup2
EMPHASIZED.

02:15:38.163 --> 02:15:42.668 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE

02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:43.669 region:rollup2
AGREEING TO I'M HOPEFULLY COMING

02:15:42.668 --> 02:15:46.071 region:rollup2
OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE.

02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:48.374 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN WHEN

02:15:46.071 --> 02:15:49.541 region:rollup2
THE LANDLORDS AND REAL ESTATE

02:15:48.374 --> 02:15:52.244 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY CAME TO THIS

02:15:49.541 --> 02:15:54.413 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. THEN THEY SAID WITH

02:15:52.244 --> 02:15:56.081 region:rollup2
THE ALICE ACT ITEM WE NEED

02:15:54.413 --> 02:15:59.451 region:rollup2
RELIEF WE NEED PROTECTION.

02:15:56.081 --> 02:16:01.553 region:rollup2
FROM. I OF LOCAL ORDINANCE AT

02:15:59.451 --> 02:16:03.222 region:rollup2
THAT WE PERCEIVE MAY. FORCE US

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:04.990 region:rollup2
TO REMAIN IN THE RENTAL HOUSING

02:16:03.222 --> 02:16:07.092 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AND WE NEED REALLY FROM

02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:08.627 region:rollup2
THIS NASH CASE THAT WE THINK

02:16:07.092 --> 02:16:09.895 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE A STATE AND AROUND

02:16:08.627 --> 02:16:12.464 region:rollup2
HOUSING BUSINESS AND IN THAT

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:13.699 region:rollup2
RESPECT. THE ELLIS ACT WAS A

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:17.036 region:rollup2
SHIELD A SHIELD.

02:16:13.699 --> 02:16:19.204 region:rollup2
FOR LANDLORDS TO.

02:16:17.036 --> 02:16:20.506 region:rollup2
WHO MAY AS I SAY BE FORCED TO

02:16:19.204 --> 02:16:21.507 region:rollup2
STAY IN THE RENTAL HOUSING

02:16:20.506 --> 02:16:23.008 region:rollup2
BUSINESS TO DO?

02:16:21.507 --> 02:16:25.044 region:rollup2
THE OPERATION OF THE LOCAL

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:27.680 region:rollup2
ORDINANCES WAS A SHIELD NOW MANY

02:16:25.044 --> 02:16:29.682 region:rollup2
YEARS LATER. EMPHATICALLY WITH

02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:32.684 region:rollup2
THE ADDITION OF COSTA HAWKINS.

02:16:29.682 --> 02:16:34.286 region:rollup2
TO OUR SET OF LAWS REGULATING

02:16:32.684 --> 02:16:36.021 region:rollup2
LOCAL RENT CONTROL AT THE STATE

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:37.556 region:rollup2
LEVEL. WE ARE SEEING A DIFFERENT

02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:40.426 region:rollup2
TREND AND THAT TREND IS THAT THE

02:16:37.556 --> 02:16:42.127 region:rollup2
SHIELD HAS BEEN TURNED IN SOME

02:16:40.426 --> 02:16:44.863 region:rollup2
CASES INTO A SWORD. A SWORD THAT

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:46.632 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED TO EVADE.

02:16:44.863 --> 02:16:48.801 region:rollup2
A CLEAR REQUIREMENTS OF THE

02:16:46.632 --> 02:16:50.869 region:rollup2
LOCAL ORDINANCE WITH RESPECT TO

02:16:48.801 --> 02:16:52.571 region:rollup2
BOTH GOOD BECAUSE REQUIREMENTS

02:16:50.869 --> 02:16:54.073 region:rollup2
AND INSURING. BOTTOM THE

02:16:52.571 --> 02:16:57.009 region:rollup2
PRESERVATION OF RENT CONTROL

02:16:54.073 --> 02:16:58.577 region:rollup2
UNITS AND SO THAT PARTICULAR

02:16:57.009 --> 02:16:59.745 region:rollup2
WITH THESE AMENDMENTS TODAY IS

02:16:58.577 --> 02:17:01.380 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IT'S

02:16:59.745 --> 02:17:03.148 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:05.050 region:rollup2
IF YOU AGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF

02:17:03.148 --> 02:17:07.086 region:rollup2
THE ALICE ACT WHICH IS THE HOT.

02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:08.620 region:rollup2
IT PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR A

02:17:07.086 --> 02:17:10.189 region:rollup2
CLAMOR TO GO OUT OF THE RENTAL

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:11.890 region:rollup2
HOUSING BUSINESS.

02:17:10.189 --> 02:17:14.059 region:rollup2
NOTHING WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:16.195 region:rollup2
AFFECTS ANY LANDLORD DESIRING TO

02:17:14.059 --> 02:17:17.763 region:rollup2
DO THAT BUT WHAT WE ARE.

02:17:16.195 --> 02:17:19.331 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE IS TIGHTEN

02:17:17.763 --> 02:17:21.467 region:rollup2
UP THE RULES FOR THOSE ARE USING

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:23.202 region:rollup2
ALICE ACT. IN IN A WAY THAT IT'S

02:17:21.467 --> 02:17:24.002 region:rollup2
GAMESMANSHIP TO AVOID THE

02:17:23.202 --> 02:17:25.504 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF THE LOCAL

02:17:24.002 --> 02:17:28.774 region:rollup2
ORDINANCE AND.

02:17:25.504 --> 02:17:30.109 region:rollup2
AND IN SO DOING WE ARE I THINK

02:17:28.774 --> 02:17:32.711 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL

02:17:30.109 --> 02:17:33.979 region:rollup2
INTENT OF THE ACT. UPDATING IT

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:36.215 region:rollup2
IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE ARE

02:17:33.979 --> 02:17:37.349 region:rollup2
SEEING AS ARE THE TRENDS BY SOME

02:17:36.215 --> 02:17:38.517 region:rollup2
UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS WHO WERE

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:39.885 region:rollup2
USING ALICE ACT NO WAY THAT WAS

02:17:38.517 --> 02:17:40.652 region:rollup2
NEVER INTENDED.

02:17:39.885 --> 02:17:42.287 region:rollup2
I THINK WITH THE AMENDMENTS

02:17:40.652 --> 02:17:43.689 region:rollup2
TODAY AND WITH THE WORK THAT

02:17:42.287 --> 02:17:45.290 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE WITH CA WE HAVE A

02:17:43.689 --> 02:17:47.693 region:rollup2
BILL THAT'S VERY NARROWLY

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:48.327 region:rollup2
TAILORED TO THAT OBJECTIVE. AND

02:17:47.693 --> 02:17:51.029 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE

02:17:48.327 --> 02:17:52.831 region:rollup2
AND I ABOUT.

02:17:51.029 --> 02:17:53.966 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:17:52.831 --> 02:17:55.534 region:rollup2
MY NAME IS ALLISON REGAN I'M A

STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF

02:17:55.534 --> 02:17:58.303 region:rollup2
WEST HOLLYWOOD OF COURSE ONE

02:17:56.869 --> 02:17:59.872 region:rollup2
ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER

02:17:58.303 --> 02:18:01.106 region:rollup2
OSTROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM HAS

02:17:59.872 --> 02:18:02.407 region:rollup2
SAID I ALSO JUST WANT TO POINT

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:03.775 region:rollup2
OUT. THIS BILL IS REALLY IN

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:05.177 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILL IT'S

02:18:03.775 --> 02:18:06.345 region:rollup2
MEANT TO ADDRESS WHAT WE'RE

02:18:05.177 --> 02:18:08.380 region:rollup2
SEEING IS A CURRENT AFFORDABLE

02:18:06.345 --> 02:18:10.582 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS. BECAUSE IT SEEKS

02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:12.151 region:rollup2
TO CURB THE MOST EGREGIOUS

02:18:10.582 --> 02:18:14.486 region:rollup2
ABUSES THAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE

02:18:12.151 --> 02:18:15.854 region:rollup2
GROUND WHERE SOME UNSCRUPULOUS

02:18:14.486 --> 02:18:17.890 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS WILL TARGET THE MOST

02:18:15.854 --> 02:18:19.191 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE FAMILIES WHO ARE AT

02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:20.425 region:rollup2
RISK FOR DISPLACEMENT.

02:18:19.191 --> 02:18:22.227 region:rollup2
SO THIS CLOSE OF SOME OF THOSE

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:23.862 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLES AND GETS BACK TO WHAT

02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:26.198 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL

02:18:23.862 --> 02:18:28.100 region:rollup2
WAS WHICH WAS TO ALLOW LANDLORDS

02:18:26.198 --> 02:18:30.402 region:rollup2
TO COMPLETELY LEAVE THE RENTAL

02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:31.703 region:rollup2
MARKET. AND SO AS AS BRIAN SAID

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:33.038 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING IT BEING USED NOW

02:18:31.703 --> 02:18:34.606 region:rollup2

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:17.676 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION PASSED IN ORDER TO

02:20:16.475 --> 02:20:19.144 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT A PROPERTY OWNER

02:20:17.676 --> 02:20:20.445 region:rollup2
COULD EXIT THE MARKET AND IT'S

02:20:19.144 --> 02:20:22.481 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT

02:20:20.445 --> 02:20:24.316 region:rollup2
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE

02:20:22.481 --> 02:20:25.584 region:rollup2
TO USE. THE OUTSIDE WHETHER IT'S

02:20:24.316 --> 02:20:27.486 region:rollup2
IN SAN FRANCISCO WEST HOLLYWOOD

02:20:25.584 --> 02:20:29.021 region:rollup2
OR SANTA MONICA THEY ARE VERY

02:20:27.486 --> 02:20:31.056 region:rollup2
SMALL RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS

02:20:29.021 --> 02:20:32.624 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO DATA FROM EACH OF

02:20:31.056 --> 02:20:34.293 region:rollup2
THOSE CITIES THE AVERAGE UNIT

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:36.028 region:rollup2
SIZE IS LESS THAN FOUR CITIES

02:20:34.293 --> 02:20:36.928 region:rollup2
ARE SMALL MOM AND POPS. WHO ARE

02:20:36.028 --> 02:20:38.330 region:rollup2
USING THE ELLIS ACT?

02:20:36.928 --> 02:20:39.898 region:rollup2
AN OWNER WHO HAS A LARGE

02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:40.866 region:rollup2
BUILDING DOES NOT TYPICALLY DO

02:20:39.898 --> 02:20:42.301 region:rollup2
THIS IT DOESN'T MAKE FINANCIAL

02:20:40.866 --> 02:20:43.535 region:rollup2
SENSE THEY'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF

02:20:42.301 --> 02:20:45.337 region:rollup2
STAYING IN THE RENTAL MARKET. SO

02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:47.005 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT NOTICE

02:20:45.337 --> 02:20:48.573 region:rollup2
ALSO WHEN THE OUTSIDE IS USED

02:20:47.005 --> 02:20:50.809 region:rollup2
IT'S ALWAYS USED AS A LAST

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:52.044 region:rollup2
RESORT IT IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:52.778 region:rollup2
AND DIFFICULT TO GO TO AN

02:20:52.044 --> 02:20:55.180 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE PROCEEDING.

02:20:52.778 --> 02:20:56.181 region:rollup2
IT COSTS UPWARDS OF HUNDREDS OF

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:57.382 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE

02:20:56.181 --> 02:21:01.153 region:rollup2
TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS

02:20:57.382 --> 02:21:02.187 region:rollup2
SOLDIERS DO USE IT AS A LAST

02:21:01.153 --> 02:21:02.754 region:rollup2
RESORT.

02:21:02.187 --> 02:21:03.388 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID I THINK OUR

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:04.723 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES WITH THIS LEGISLATION

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:06.792 region:rollup2
WAS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS

02:21:04.723 --> 02:21:08.727 region:rollup2
BALANCE. AND THAT LITTLE UNITS

02:21:06.792 --> 02:21:10.996 region:rollup2
COULD BE RETURNED TO THE RENTAL

02:21:08.727 --> 02:21:12.531 region:rollup2
MARKET AFTER A APPEARED OF TIME

02:21:10.996 --> 02:21:14.032 region:rollup2
THAT WAS REASONABLE AND I THINK

02:21:12.531 --> 02:21:15.667 region:rollup2
WE'VE GONE TO THAT WE'RE GETTING

02:21:14.032 --> 02:21:16.802 region:rollup2
TO THAT POINT IN. YOU KNOW WE

02:21:15.667 --> 02:21:19.905 region:rollup2
ALL KNOW THAT WE FACE A

02:21:16.802 --> 02:21:19.905 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS SO

02:21:19.971 --> 02:21:23.008 region:rollup2
WE WOULD LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITY

02:21:21.506 --> 02:21:24.443 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE TO RETURN UNITS TO

02:21:23.008 --> 02:21:25.610 region:rollup2
THEM RENTAL MARKET. HOT SO I

02:21:24.443 --> 02:21:26.645 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:28.246 region:rollup2
FOR WE APPRECIATE THESE ON

02:21:26.645 --> 02:21:29.114 region:rollup2
NUMBER WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL

02:21:28.246 --> 02:21:30.582 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WERE.

02:21:29.114 --> 02:21:31.450 region:rollup2
WE'VE GONE THERE BUT ONCE YOU

02:21:30.582 --> 02:21:32.351 region:rollup2
SEE THE LANGUAGE I THINK WE'LL

02:21:31.450 --> 02:21:35.787 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO.

AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED OF

02:21:45.130 --> 02:21:48.200 region:rollup2
THE ELLIS ACT WAS A BIPARTISAN

02:21:46.932 --> 02:21:49.301 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE THE THAT WAS REACHED

02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:50.669 region:rollup2

CONDITIONS.

02:22:03.949 --> 02:22:06.651 region:rollup2
THE L. SAT DOES PROVIDE A

02:22:05.584 --> 02:22:07.686 region:rollup2
REASONABLE SOLUTION TO GIVE

02:32:11.656 --> 02:32:16.260 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY ARE FORCED TO LEAVE

02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:18.630 region:rollup2

UNAFFORDABLE.

02:32:26.838 --> 02:32:30.508 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS ALSO A CRISIS IN AN

02:32:30.041 --> 02:32:31.709 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:32:30.508 --> 02:32:34.345 region:rollup2

02:33:20.591 --> 02:33:23.561 region:rollup2
OF THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:25.163 region:rollup2
BILL. AT THIS TIME.

02:33:23.561 --> 02:33:27.031 region:rollup2
I'M ASKED MS REGAN TO DO CAPITA

02:33:25.163 --> 02:33:29.267 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SHE'LL DO WITH MORE

02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:30.535 region:rollup2

ON THE.

02:33:30.535 --> 02:33:34.105 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY SO AS WE MENTIONED

02:33:32.136 --> 02:33:36.174 region:rollup2
BEFORE THIS THIS DOESN'T DO

02:33:34.105 --> 02:33:38.076 region:rollup2
ANYTHING TO. CHANGE.

02:33:36.174 --> 02:33:40.812 region:rollup2
BUT THE LANDLORD'S ABILITY TO

02:33:38.076 --> 02:33:41.446 region:rollup2
LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET WHAT IT

02:33:40.812 --> 02:33:43.881 region:rollup2
DOES IS IT.

02:33:41.446 --> 02:33:46.918 region:rollup2
BALANCES OUT.

02:33:43.881 --> 02:33:48.052 region:rollup2
THE IT VIENT INCENTIVE NOW TO

02:33:46.918 --> 02:33:49.487 region:rollup2
EMPTY THE BUILDING IN ORDER TO

02:33:48.052 --> 02:33:51.022 region:rollup2
PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET TO

02:33:49.487 --> 02:33:53.424 region:rollup2
CHARGE MARKET RATES ESSENTIALLY

02:33:51.022 --> 02:33:55.159 region:rollup2
SO. WHO'S AT RISK HERE ARE THE

02:33:53.424 --> 02:33:57.295 region:rollup2
CURRENT TENANTS WHO ARE WHO ARE

02:33:55.159 --> 02:33:59.397 region:rollup2
PROBABLY LONG TERM LOW RENT

02:33:57.295 --> 02:34:01.532 region:rollup2
TENANTS AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE

02:33:59.397 --> 02:34:03.234 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS THAT WE. IT BECAUSE

02:34:01.532 --> 02:34:05.169 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE HAS IT HAS USED THE

ALICE BILL PROPERLY THEY WILL

02:34:05.169 --> 02:34:09.373 region:rollup2
HAVE LEFT THE RENTAL MARKET

02:34:06.337 --> 02:34:10.641 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY. AND SO THE CONCERN WAS

02:34:09.373 --> 02:34:12.443 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS THAT

02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:14.312 region:rollup2
ARE ONLY SEEKING TO USE IT AS A

02:34:12.443 --> 02:34:16.080 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY MEASURE IN ORDER TO

02:34:14.312 --> 02:34:17.148 region:rollup2
EMPTY THE BUILDING AND SO WHAT

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:19.650 region:rollup2
THE MEASURES ARE.

02:34:17.148 --> 02:34:20.651 region:rollup2
OUR TO OUR INCREASE RIGHT NOW

02:34:19.650 --> 02:34:21.853 region:rollup2
THERE'S A RESTRICTION.

02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:23.354 region:rollup2
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE

02:34:21.853 --> 02:34:24.789 region:rollup2
OF SOMEONE RE ENTERS THE MARKET

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:26.557 region:rollup2
IN TWO YEARS WE'VE INCREASED

02:34:24.789 --> 02:34:28.059 region:rollup2
THOSE TO FIVE YEARS OF THE SAME

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:31.162 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ARE PLACED BUT THE

02:34:28.059 --> 02:34:32.096 region:rollup2
TIME LIMIT IS TWO TO FIVE OKAY.

02:34:31.162 --> 02:34:33.431 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY INSTANCE OF THERE'S

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:34.699 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS AND NOW GOES TO FIVE

02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:36.634 region:rollup2
YEARS ARACHNIDS FOR OKAY.

02:34:34.699 --> 02:34:38.336 region:rollup2
THE SECOND PROVISION IS A FIVE

02:34:36.634 --> 02:34:40.438 region:rollup2
YEAR RESTRICTION PROVISION THAT

02:34:38.336 --> 02:34:41.939 region:rollup2
REMAINS AS IT IS WE ORIGINALLY

02:34:40.438 --> 02:34:43.841 region:rollup2
WERE UPPING THAT TEN WE'VE

02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:45.476 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWN THAT AT THE REQUEST OF

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:47.845 region:rollup2
THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION.

02:34:45.476 --> 02:34:49.180 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE DONE

02:34:47.845 --> 02:34:52.083 region:rollup2
IS WE'VE ELIMINATED THERE'S

02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:53.117 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A CAP ON DAMAGES FOR

02:34:52.083 --> 02:34:55.153 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROVISIONS WE'VE

02:34:53.117 --> 02:34:55.787 region:rollup2
TAKEN THAT OUT.

02:34:55.153 --> 02:34:57.288 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

02:34:55.787 --> 02:34:58.856 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING IS WE'VE

02:34:57.288 --> 02:35:01.225 region:rollup2
CLARIFIED IT'S A IT'S A

02:34:58.856 --> 02:35:02.827 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION. WHICH WAS THE

02:35:01.225 --> 02:35:04.862 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL TO

02:35:02.827 --> 02:35:06.731 region:rollup2
HAVE ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE

02:35:04.862 --> 02:35:08.733 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROPERTY WHERE IT

02:35:06.731 --> 02:35:09.700 region:rollup2
CONCERNS OF THE TIMELINES FOR

02:35:08.733 --> 02:35:11.602 region:rollup2
THESE RESTRICTIONS AND WE'VE

02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:13.070 region:rollup2
CLARIFIED THAT. IN VARIOUS

02:35:11.602 --> 02:35:14.705 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL TO MAKE

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:16.474 region:rollup2
IT CONSISTENT THAT THERE IS ONE

02:35:14.705 --> 02:35:17.575 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR THE PROPERTY

02:35:16.474 --> 02:35:20.411 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THAT.

02:35:17.575 --> 02:35:22.613 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN ONLY

02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:24.182 region:rollup2
WITHDRAW ALL OF THE UNITS FROM

02:35:22.613 --> 02:35:26.484 region:rollup2
THE FROM THE RENTAL MARKET YOU

02:35:24.182 --> 02:35:27.251 region:rollup2
CAN'T THEN. RETURN THEM TO THE

02:35:26.484 --> 02:35:28.653 region:rollup2
RENTAL MARKET IN A PIECEMEAL

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:29.854 region:rollup2
FASHION IN THE PROPERTIES OF

02:35:28.653 --> 02:35:31.455 region:rollup2
THEIR ON THE RENTAL MARKET ARTS

02:35:29.854 --> 02:35:33.057 region:rollup2
OFF.

02:35:31.455 --> 02:35:34.292 region:rollup2
OKAY SO I UNDERSTAND THE FOUR

02:35:33.057 --> 02:35:35.827 region:rollup2
MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AS

02:35:34.292 --> 02:35:36.460 region:rollup2
IT'S CURRENTLY CSUS AGREED TO

02:35:35.827 --> 02:35:37.161 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:39.230 region:rollup2
HER HERE.

02:35:37.161 --> 02:35:41.399 region:rollup2
IS THAT THAT THE TWO YEAR.

02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:43.868 region:rollup2
TIME LIMIT NOW GOES TO FIVE

02:35:41.399 --> 02:35:45.937 region:rollup2
YEARS EVE NOT YOU'VE OUT REMOVE

02:35:43.868 --> 02:35:47.238 region:rollup2
THE TEN YEAR EXTENSION KEEPING

02:35:45.937 --> 02:35:47.939 region:rollup2
AT THE EXISTING FIVE WHICH IS

02:35:47.238 --> 02:35:49.874 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW.

02:35:47.939 --> 02:35:51.642 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NO CAP ON DAMAGES

02:35:49.874 --> 02:35:53.277 region:rollup2
FOR PROPERTY OWNERS WHO VIOLATE

02:35:51.642 --> 02:35:54.912 region:rollup2
THE TERMS OF ALICE.

02:35:53.277 --> 02:35:56.280 region:rollup2
TIME AND THAT THERE IS A UNIFORM

02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:57.315 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL DATE NOT A PEACE

02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:58.316 region:rollup2
MILLON SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT

02:35:57.315 --> 02:35:59.951 region:rollup2
THE BILL THAT WERE FACED WITH.

02:35:58.316 --> 02:36:02.019 region:rollup2
THEIR TWO PROVISIONS THAT I

02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:02.587 region:rollup2
WOULD BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

02:36:02.019 --> 02:36:03.955 region:rollup2
I WANNA MAKE SURE WITH FIVE

02:36:02.587 --> 02:36:05.389 region:rollup2
POINT ONE IS A DIVERT PIPELINE

02:36:03.955 --> 02:36:06.591 region:rollup2
PROVISION I RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE

02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:08.226 region:rollup2
COULD BE IN A RAIN DALLAS

02:36:06.591 --> 02:36:09.193 region:rollup2
PROCESS TODAY. I'M I THINK

02:36:08.226 --> 02:36:10.328 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS A CONCERN

02:36:09.193 --> 02:36:11.562 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL WOULD AFFECT

02:36:10.328 --> 02:36:13.197 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO EXERCISE

02:36:11.562 --> 02:36:14.999 region:rollup2
THEIR RIGHTS NOW IN ADVANCE OF

02:36:13.197 --> 02:36:16.500 region:rollup2
THIS BECOMING LAW A WHAT IS THE

02:36:14.999 --> 02:36:17.468 region:rollup2
STATUS OF THAT IN THIS BILL SO

02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:20.037 region:rollup2
WE'VE AGREED WE'VE AGREED TO

02:36:17.468 --> 02:36:22.673 region:rollup2
THAT IN PRINCIPLE EMERGES.

02:36:20.037 --> 02:36:23.474 region:rollup2
FIRING UP THE LANGUAGE.

02:36:22.673 --> 02:36:24.976 region:rollup2
THE RESULT OF.

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:25.977 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:36:24.976 --> 02:36:27.211 region:rollup2
SOME HERE AND THAT AND THAT WILL

02:36:25.977 --> 02:36:29.180 region:rollup2
BE CLEAR IN THAT YOU DON'T.

02:36:27.211 --> 02:36:29.714 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A NEED

02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:31.215 region:rollup2
FOR OUR DESIRE TO DO SOME

02:36:29.714 --> 02:36:32.416 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ACTION YOU KNOW I

02:36:31.215 --> 02:36:33.284 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE TO TREAT PEOPLE.

02:36:32.416 --> 02:36:35.553 region:rollup2
WHO FOLLOWING THE RULES

02:36:33.284 --> 02:36:36.187 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY? IN THAT WAY HIM AS

02:36:35.553 --> 02:36:37.755 region:rollup2
MUCH AS WE WANT TO CHANGE IT YOU

02:36:36.187 --> 02:36:38.923 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:36:37.755 --> 02:36:40.491 region:rollup2
DIDN'T SPY SAFE YOUR INTERNET

02:36:38.923 --> 02:36:43.427 region:rollup2
TODAY YOU PLAY BY TODAY'S RULES

02:36:40.491 --> 02:36:44.028 region:rollup2
IF THE LAW CHANGES SUBSEQUENTLY.

02:36:43.427 --> 02:36:45.096 region:rollup2
THEN THE THAT THOSE RULES WILL

02:36:44.028 --> 02:36:46.163 region:rollup2
APPLY OKAY.

02:36:45.096 --> 02:36:47.832 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE THE LAST QUESTION

02:36:46.163 --> 02:36:48.833 region:rollup2
IS WITH CARTED TO THE VACANT

02:36:47.832 --> 02:36:51.335 region:rollup2
UNITS.

02:36:48.833 --> 02:36:52.436 region:rollup2
ISSUE I AND MR BUT I THINK YOU

02:36:51.335 --> 02:36:54.739 region:rollup2
WERE SAYING THAT THERE'S A.

02:36:52.436 --> 02:36:56.340 region:rollup2
A TERM WHICH I DON'T MAYBE THE

02:36:54.739 --> 02:36:57.108 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANCE IS LOST ON ME BUT

02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:59.277 region:rollup2
VENTED.

02:36:57.108 --> 02:37:00.444 region:rollup2
UNIT YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT A

02:36:59.277 --> 02:37:03.881 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE I KNOW

02:37:00.444 --> 02:37:05.116 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALSO SIGNIFICANT.

02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:07.084 region:rollup2
SURE THERE THERE WAS A REQUEST

02:37:05.116 --> 02:37:08.619 region:rollup2
US A SEVENTY SIXTY POINT FOUR

02:37:07.084 --> 02:37:10.988 region:rollup2
WE'VE CHANGED THE WORD

02:37:08.619 --> 02:37:12.857 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS TO UNIT. BECAUSE

02:37:10.988 --> 02:37:13.958 region:rollup2
WE WILL AGAIN THAT'S CONSISTENT

02:37:12.857 --> 02:37:15.259 region:rollup2
WITH THE POSITION THAT THERE'S

02:37:13.958 --> 02:37:16.794 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE AND

02:37:15.259 --> 02:37:17.728 region:rollup2
SOME COURTS HAVE BEEN CONFUSED

02:37:16.794 --> 02:37:19.196 region:rollup2
BY THE USE OF THE WORD

02:37:17.728 --> 02:37:20.831 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS BECAUSE IT SEEMS

02:37:19.196 --> 02:37:21.365 region:rollup2
TO ME IN ONE THING AND ONE

02:37:20.831 --> 02:37:22.400 region:rollup2
SECTION ANOTHER THING AND

02:37:21.365 --> 02:37:24.402 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE.

02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:26.103 region:rollup2
SO WE CHANGE THE WORD TO UNIT.

02:37:24.402 --> 02:37:27.905 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT SUSPICION ASKED US

02:37:26.103 --> 02:37:29.540 region:rollup2
TO ADD THE WORD RENTAL IN FRONT

WHEN I THINK ABOUT RENT CONTROL

REALITY THAT.

02:39:42.039 --> 02:39:45.743 region:rollup2
WE MAY HAVE A BALLOT INITIATIVE

02:39:44.742 --> 02:39:47.111 region:rollup2
WHERE THIS MAY BE A STATEWIDE

02:39:45.743 --> 02:39:48.679 region:rollup2
ISSUE SO I THINK OF IT IN THE

02:39:47.111 --> 02:39:50.815 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF LIKE WHAT WOULD THIS

02:39:48.679 --> 02:39:52.917 region:rollup2
MEAN NOT JUST FOR MUNICIPALITIES

02:39:50.815 --> 02:39:54.351 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE YEARS. OF WORKING ON

02:39:52.917 --> 02:39:55.920 region:rollup2
THIS BUT SHOULD THIS TIME AND

02:39:54.351 --> 02:39:57.388 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENING AND THROUGH A

02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:59.924 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE BALLOT INITIATIVE ON

02:39:57.388 --> 02:40:01.358 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF IMPACT HAS AND THE

02:39:59.924 --> 02:40:03.160 region:rollup2
SECOND PIECE IS.

02:40:01.358 --> 02:40:05.329 region:rollup2
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH.

02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:08.199 region:rollup2
OBSCURE CREATIVE.

02:40:05.329 --> 02:40:09.300 region:rollup2
SCARY KIND OF HOUSING SITUATION

02:40:08.199 --> 02:40:10.601 region:rollup2
IN MY DISTRICT LIKE I DO NOW

02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:12.603 region:rollup2
WITH THE NATURAL DISASTERS.

02:40:10.601 --> 02:40:15.206 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE.

02:40:12.603 --> 02:40:15.806 region:rollup2
SO MANY EXAMPLES NOW OF THINGS

02:40:15.206 --> 02:40:17.208 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT OF THE

02:40:15.806 --> 02:40:19.143 region:rollup2
BOX.

02:40:17.208 --> 02:40:20.511 region:rollup2
AND AND IN THINGS THAT.

02:40:19.143 --> 02:40:21.979 region:rollup2
I.

02:40:20.511 --> 02:40:22.913 region:rollup2
I COULDN'T HAVE NECESSARILY

02:40:21.979 --> 02:40:25.883 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF.

02:40:22.913 --> 02:40:27.818 region:rollup2
BUT BEFORE THIS BUT THAT ALSO

02:40:25.883 --> 02:40:29.386 region:rollup2
WORRY ME BECAUSE.

02:40:27.818 --> 02:40:31.489 region:rollup2
I DID THERE'S A LOT OF HOUSING

02:40:29.386 --> 02:40:32.823 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE REBUILT AND BUT

02:40:31.489 --> 02:40:34.525 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO I MEAN THERE WAS A

02:40:32.823 --> 02:40:36.026 region:rollup2
PERIOD IN INVENTOR OF WHERE WE

02:40:34.525 --> 02:40:37.428 region:rollup2
WERE WE WE CAN FAN FIND

02:40:36.026 --> 02:40:38.629 region:rollup2
VACANCIES ANYWHERE AND WE NEEDED

02:40:37.428 --> 02:40:41.398 region:rollup2
TO PUT PEOPLE AND.

02:40:38.629 --> 02:40:42.733 region:rollup2
ANY SEE MY COLLEAGUE WHOSE

02:40:41.398 --> 02:40:44.902 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES I MEAN WE'RE SO.

02:40:42.733 --> 02:40:46.036 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT AND I DON'T

02:40:44.902 --> 02:40:50.241 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS.

02:40:46.036 --> 02:40:51.942 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE TO THOSE TWO THINGS I

02:40:50.241 --> 02:40:53.777 region:rollup2
THINK AND HAVE ME LOOKING AT

02:40:51.942 --> 02:40:55.379 region:rollup2
THIS BILL I'M IN A DIFFERENT WAY

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:57.181 region:rollup2
THAT I MAY HAVE OTHERWISE LOOKED

02:40:55.379 --> 02:40:58.816 region:rollup2
AT IT. AND AND I KNOW.

02:40:57.181 --> 02:40:59.984 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE.

02:40:58.816 --> 02:41:01.452 region:rollup2
WE'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH WITH

02:40:59.984 --> 02:41:02.786 region:rollup2
ASK QUESTIONS.

02:41:01.452 --> 02:41:04.155 region:rollup2
HAD THEY WENT THROUGH THE IN

02:41:02.786 --> 02:41:06.257 region:rollup2
ALLEGANY OUNCES AND YOU KNOW

02:41:04.155 --> 02:41:06.524 region:rollup2
POINT OUT SOME SOME AREAS THAT

02:41:06.257 --> 02:41:09.894 region:rollup2
WERE HOW.

02:41:06.524 --> 02:41:11.695 region:rollup2
THAT WERE OF CONCERN AND I AM

02:41:09.894 --> 02:41:13.664 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT.

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:15.099 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT ON

02:41:13.664 --> 02:41:18.435 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE SITES.

02:41:15.099 --> 02:41:20.137 region:rollup2
BY I THINK THE CLARIFICATION ON

02:41:18.435 --> 02:41:21.438 region:rollup2
AND IN A DEFINED DEFINING THE

02:41:20.137 --> 02:41:24.542 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL DATE.

02:41:21.438 --> 02:41:25.910 region:rollup2
ON WHEN I'M UNITS GO BACK INTO

02:41:24.542 --> 02:41:28.245 region:rollup2
THE MARKET ARE PIECES THAT.

02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:29.914 region:rollup2
I THINK OUR AS WAS SPOKEN NEEDED

02:41:28.245 --> 02:41:31.282 region:rollup2
I'M AND THIS WAS NEVER INTENDED

02:41:29.914 --> 02:41:32.483 region:rollup2
TO BE A LOOP AROUND.

02:41:31.282 --> 02:41:34.485 region:rollup2
LA.

02:41:32.483 --> 02:41:36.287 region:rollup2
I ALSO AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF

02:41:34.485 --> 02:41:37.888 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONES ABOUT WHEN YOU

02:41:36.287 --> 02:41:39.089 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THE TIMING TWO TO FIVE

02:41:37.888 --> 02:41:41.058 region:rollup2
FIVE TO TEN.

02:41:39.089 --> 02:41:41.992 region:rollup2
JUST CREE OTHER PARTICULAR

02:41:41.058 --> 02:41:44.528 region:rollup2
ISSUES SO.

02:41:41.992 --> 02:41:46.797 region:rollup2

SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE I IT

02:41:46.797 --> 02:41:49.867 region:rollup2
DOES CHANGE HOW I THINK ABOUT

02:41:48.566 --> 02:41:52.136 region:rollup2

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:03.280 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION.

02:42:01.979 --> 02:42:04.481 region:rollup2

IS THE SAME AS THE LAST BILL BUT

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:53.083 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ALSO ELIMINATES THE

02:49:50.781 --> 02:49:54.484 region:rollup2
CAP ON INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS WHO

02:49:53.083 --> 02:49:55.986 region:rollup2
