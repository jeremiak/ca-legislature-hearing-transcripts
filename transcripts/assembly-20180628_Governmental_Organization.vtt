I DO WE HAVE --

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:42.675
WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.642
MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SCOTT

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:44.310
WHAT SHOULD BE AT THE CALIFORNIA

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:46.211
STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.846
WORKERS CAN BE VERY BRIEF MAKE

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.181
THREE POINTS.

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:51.684
BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITY ISSUES

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.918
IN THE WILD FIRES WITH MOST

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.320
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:55.487
EVERY YEAR.

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:58.457
THE UTILITIES GET ABOUT 25% OF

00:15:58.524 --> 00:15:59.992
THE MONEY THEY INVEST INTO THE

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.527
SYSTEM FOR OPERATIONS AND

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:02.494
MAINTENANCE FROM THE INVESTMENT

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:03.529
COMMUNITY.

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:06.398
THAT'S NOW GONE SO AT A TIME

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.133
WHEN WE NEED TO INVEST TO HARDEN

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.768
THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT MORE

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:10.969
FIREPROOF.

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:13.405
WERE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE LESS

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.708
THEN A ROLE YOU HAVE 75% OR LESS

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:16.975
OF THE DOLLARS WE TYPICALLY

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.577
WOULD HAVE TO INVEST.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.245
SO THIS BILL IS CRITICAL IN THAT

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:21.947
IT FORCES THE P. YOU SEE FOR THE

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:23.982
FIRST TIME TO FOCUS ON SAFETY

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:26.218
AND AND PUT MORE TIME AND EFFORT

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:28.220
INTO SAFETY.

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.955
THE SECOND THING THAT THIS BILL

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:31.924
DOES IS IT OPENS UP THE PROCESS

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.125
TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:35.661
FIRE OFFICIALS TO PART TO PAY.

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:37.229
AND THEN LASTLY THE AMENDMENTS

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:39.031
THAT THE AUTHOR WORKED OUT WITH

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:40.866
THE COMMITTEE ARE REALLY

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.568
GROUNDBREAKING MISTER CHAIRMAN.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.970
IN TWO RESPECTS IT SAYS THAT.

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:47.072
NGUYEN THESE PLANS ARE ADOPTED

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.273
AND WIN THE PEACE YOU SEE THEN

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.708
ADOPTS.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.610
A A RATE INCREASE LIKE THEY DO

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.746
IN EVERY RATE CASE. FOR

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:55.514
INVESTMENT BUT WHEN THEY ADOPT A

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.049
RATE INCREASE TO HELP PAY FOR

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:59.485
THIS INVESTMENT IN THE SYSTEM.

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:01.220
THAT THEY'VE THE RATE INCREASE

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.155
HAS TO BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:04.757
BENEFIT.

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:06.325
THAT IS RECEIVED BY EACH RATE

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:07.793
TEAR.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.062
EACH RATE CLASS SO THAT IT

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:12.664
PROTECTS AGAINST --

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:13.565
FOR INSTANCE THERE'S CONCERNS

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:15.234
THAT PERHAPS INDUSTRIAL OR

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.836
AGRICULTURAL OR BUSINESS --

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:18.971
RATEPAYERS WOULD BE

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:20.506
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIT THIS

00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:22.674
PROTECTS AGAINST THAT THE SECOND

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:23.842
THING THAT IT DOES THAT IS

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:26.111
GROUNDBREAKING.

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:27.579
IS IT IS STATES THAT WHEN THE

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:29.982
RATE INCREASE IS APPROVED LIKE

00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:31.617
IT IS IN EVERY GENERATE CASE TO

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:33.585
PAY FOR THESE INVESTMENTS.

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:35.387
THAT THE RATE INCREASE HAS TO BE

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.989
APPLIED [inaudible]

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:39.057
GEOGRAPHICALLY.

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.192
CONSISTENT WITH THE AMOUNT OF

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:41.627
INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THOSE

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:42.928
AREAS FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible]

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:44.530
IF.

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.064
SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:47.533
IS APPROVED IN.

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:48.233
NEED --

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.068
TERRITORY FOR CERTAIN

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:52.037
INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM.

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:54.907
AND A A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:55.507
THEM ARE BEING APPLIED IN THE

00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:57.609
STATE. 80% OF ITS GOING TO THE

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.578
BAY AREA AIR 80% IS GOING TO ONE

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:01.513
PARTICULAR AREA.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.614
THE RATE INCREASE WE

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:03.849
PROPORTIONATE TO WEAR THAT

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.684
BENEFIT WILL GO SAID THE RATE

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.920
PAYERS WILL ONLY BE PAYING FOR

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:09.655
THAT HARDENING OF THE SYSTEM.

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.356
IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.625
THEN OVER YEAR OVER THE YEARS AS

AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.852
SAFETY RELIABILITY IS NOT THE

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.753
FOCUS OF THOSE RATE CASES.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.688

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.468

THE PLANT THEY WILL BE FINE.

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.444
THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH DOES NOT

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:41.280
EXIST NOW AND SHOULD GREATLY

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.281

RIGHT NOW THE COMMISSION LOOK AT

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:08.373
ALL FACTS RELATED TO THIS

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.041
SPECIFIC EVENT.

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:12.277
AND DETERMINAR ABILITY.

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.212
THE BILL INSTEAD.

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.447
WOULD ONLY ALLOW THE COMMISSION

00:25:15.513 --> 00:25:17.082
ASK ONE QUESTION.

00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:20.585
AND THAT IS IS THERE A PLAN.

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:21.920
THAT HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:23.188
COMPLIED WITH THAT'S IT NOT ALL

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:25.056
FACTS.

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:26.258
ONLY IF THE PLANET BEEN

00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:27.592
SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH AND

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.261
THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:30.629
BECAUSE THERE MAY BE FACTS THAT

00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:32.130
WOULD INDICATE LIABILITY FOR THE

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.164
UTILITY.

00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:34.599
WHICH PREVENT SHIFTING THE COSTS

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:36.234
TO RATEPAYERS.

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:37.235
BUT TEN NEED IT WOULD NOT ALLOW

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:39.738
THAT LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS FOR

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:41.473
THE CPC PROCEEDING.

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:42.908
THE LANGUAGE TODAY THE INTENT

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:44.376
LANGUAGE WAS TAKEN TODAY.

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:45.677
REFERS TO NEGLIGENCE THAT IS A

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:48.580
COURT PROCEEDING.

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:49.681
THAT IS NOT TO SEE THE CPC

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:51.516
PROCEEDING.

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:53.818
AND IN THE EVENT THAT 99% THE

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.220
TIME THESE CASES ARE SETTLED IN

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:56.488
COURT OR OUT OF COURT WITHOUT A

00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:58.089
TRIAL.

00:25:58.156 --> 00:25:59.357
THERE'S NO FINDING OF NEGLIGENCE

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:01.293
IT'S AN OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT.

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:03.495
SO IT LEAVES UNTOUCHED.

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:05.497
PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT SAYS.

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:07.132
THE COMMISSION CAN ONLY LOOK AT

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:08.533
WHETHER THERE WAS A PLAN.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.368
WAS A COMPLIED WITH.

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:11.803
IF IS COMPLIED WITH THEN THERE

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.171
IS AUTOMATIC.

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:15.473
LIABILITY SHIELD FOR THE UTILITY

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.175
WHICH MEANS THE RATEPAYERS.

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:18.410
WHO PAY FOR THE SAFETY

00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:20.045
MITIGATION ON THE FRONT END?

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:22.247
WILL ALSO BE ABLE BE FORCED TO

00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:24.482
PAY FOR THE COSTS OF THE

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:25.884
WILDFIRES TO ANY OTHER MAJOR

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:26.451
EVENT.

00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:28.586
THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND THE

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:30.755
REASONS WHY WE ARE.

00:26:30.822 --> 00:26:31.389
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I'M HAPPY

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:35.727
ANSWER QUESTIONS ON MISTER

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:36.661
CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:37.996
MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:39.064
MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.765
ASSOCIATION AND FOR SOMEONE OF

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:41.499
KNOWLEDGE --

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:43.134
THE EFFORT OF THE CHAIR TO

00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:44.502
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:45.804
HAVE EXPRESSED --

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.138
BOTH IN MEETINGS AND PREVIOUSLY

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:47.706
IN -- IN

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:48.940
COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND THE

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:50.809
AUTHOR OF FOR WORKING ON THAT AS

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:52.711
WELL HOWEVER --

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:53.244
THEY DAY THEY DON'T GO FAR

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:56.414
ENOUGH THE FIRST RECOMMENDED

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.115
AMENDMENT TALKS ABOUT

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:58.817
CONSIDERING --

00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:00.051
YEAH THESE FACTORS.

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:03.755
CONSIDER IS VERY WEAK --

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:04.489
BECAUSE IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:05.557
THE PEACE YOU HAVE TO DO

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:06.825
ANYTHING DIFFERENT.

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.860
THEM WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TODAY.

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:09.961
ARE THEY CAN CONTINUE WITH THEIR

00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:12.030
THE PROCESS AS THEY HAVE WE DO

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:12.797
NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT PROCESS

00:27:12.864 --> 00:27:14.232
WORKS OUT.

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.867
VERY WELL FOR REPAIRS --

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:17.535
CONCERT OR IN ADDITION TO THAT --

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:19.371
I THINK IS MISTER HERNANDEZ IS

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:22.073
ALREADY EXPLAINED THE REDEFINING

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.808
JUST AND REASONABLE --

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:25.310
AS THIS BILL DOES.

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:26.778
CREATES A BIT OF A LOOP WHERE

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:29.047
JUST AND REASONABLE FEES INTO

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:31.850
THE SECTION FOR FIFTY ONE IN THE

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:32.851
PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE.

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.753
SMITH TALKS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.454
UTILITIES CAN PUT INTO THE RATES

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:37.956
WELL IF IT'S JUST AND REASONABLE%

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.991
MAKE IT PUT IT INTO THEIR RATES --

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:41.459
BEEN LATER THE AMENDMENTS THAT

00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:42.060
WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED BY THE

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:43.495
COMMITTEE TALK ABOUT --

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:45.030
MAKING SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.032
WITH SECTION FOUR FIFTY ONE SO

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:48.033
THE BILL KINDA POINTS BACK

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:49.901
AROUND THROUGH SECTION FOR FIFTY

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:51.036
ONE BACK TO ITSELF WITH THE

00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:51.936
AMENDMENTS.

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.104
AND THAT IS A CONCERN BECAUSE IT

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.372
DOES NOT ADDRESS THE OF THE

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:56.374
SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:57.008
TALKED ABOUT.

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:57.642
THE LAST POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE

00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:58.777
IS.

00:27:58.843 --> 00:28:00.512
WE ALL AGREE --

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:02.514
1100% THAT THAT SAFETY IS

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.282
CRITICAL SAFETY IS IMPORTANT.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.550
WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:06.785
ALL WILDFIRES BUT IT SHOULD BE

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:10.021
OUR GOAL TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:10.455
TO PREVENT THOSE --

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.856
AND MITIGATE THE DAMAGE TO YOUR

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:13.258
COMMUNITIES HOW TO OUR

00:28:13.324 --> 00:28:14.359
BUSINESSES --

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:15.693
AND TO THE STATE AS A WHOLE.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.363
HOWEVER THIS BILL GOES FURTHER

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.365
PROVIDING LIABILITY PROTECTION

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:21.533
TO THE UTILITIES AND

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.034
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THOSE

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:24.536
THOSE ISSUES WE CANNOT SUPPORT

00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:28.106
THIS BILL THE TIME.

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.574
MICHAEL VOCAL OR ON BEHALF OF

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.009
THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS

00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:33.611
ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING.

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:35.080
MANY OF THE LARGEST SAN JOAQUIN

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:35.980
VALLEY.

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:37.148
FARMING OPERATIONS FOOD

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.250
PROCESSORS AND WATER AGENCIES

00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:41.820
WHO YOU SIGNIFICANT ENERGY.

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:43.154
LIKE MISTER JOSEPH I'VE BEEN

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:44.989
PARTICIPATING IN RAPE CASES

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.724
GENERATE CASES BEFORE THE PUBLIC

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:47.525
UTILITIES COMMISSION NOW 428-

00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:50.061
YEARS.

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.329
I'M I'M GONNA VIGOROUSLY

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:52.263
DISAGREE WITH HIS

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.032
CHARACTERIZATION THAT RAPE CASES

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:56.534
ARE NOT ABOUT SAFETY.

00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:57.769
YOU CAN GIVE YOU TWO VERY

00:28:57.836 --> 00:29:00.538
CONCRETE EXAMPLES. ONE IS WHAT'S

00:29:00.605 --> 00:29:01.806
GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND THE SO

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:04.142
CAL GAS GENERAL CASE.

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:06.978
AS IT RELATES TO ALMOST ENTIRELY

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:09.114
THE IMPACTS AND SAFETY MEASURES

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.949
THAT HAVE PUT IN PLACE.

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:12.450
SINCE ONLY SO CANYON THEY'RE

00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:14.986
ASKING 440% RATE INCREASE OF

00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:15.753
THEIR CUSTOMERS TO COVER THE

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.422
COSTS.

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.858
SAME THING HAPPENED IN PJ NAY

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:20.992
FOLLOWING SAN BRUNO AS YOU MIGHT

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.727
EXPECT.

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:24.496
SO FOR SOMEONE TO SUGGEST THAT

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.965
THESE CASES AREN'T ABOUT SAFETY

00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:29.467
IS JUST FLAT OUT WRONG.

00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:31.402
THEY'RE ENTIRELY ABOUT SAFETY

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:34.539
WHEN SAFETY IS THE PRIMARY ISSUE.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:35.640
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:37.375
HERE IN THE NEXT GENERAL RATE

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.577
CASE WITH P. JEANNIE.

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:42.280
RATES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:43.915
CUSTOMERS AS RIPPER ALL I'M WELL

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:45.783
AWARE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.952
PICKING UP SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:48.920
BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE THE

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:50.755
SYSTEM SAFER.

00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:51.990
IN RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA PICK UP

00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:53.858
THOSE COSTS THIS BILL

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:55.693
UNFORTUNATELY SET UP A PROCESS

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.096
WHERE I DO BELIEVE IT IS A

00:29:58.163 --> 00:29:59.397
ALMOST A BLANK CHECK FOR THE

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:01.599
UTILITIES.

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:02.233
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SKIN IN THIS

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.136
GAME WHY WOULDN'T YOU SPEND

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.971
EVERY DIME THAT THE COMMISSION

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:08.806
WILL LET YOU SPEND ON SAFETY.

00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:10.408
BECAUSE IT WILL REDUCE POTENTIAL

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.343
YOUR LIABILITY EVEN IF SOME OF

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:13.778
THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT VERY

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:15.914
COST EFFECTIVE.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.182
IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY YOU DON'T

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:18.950
CARE YOU'RE GONNA SPEND EVERY

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:21.219
DIME HUMANLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:23.621
IT'S GREAT PAYER FUNDS.

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.356
AND THAT'S STILL A HUGE ISSUE WE

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:27.959
HAVE GOING FORWARD SO WE ALSO

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:30.161
HAD A LOVELY CHAT WITH THE HELL

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:32.096
OFFER LAST EVENING ABOUT THE

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.064
BILL -- WE

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.632
WERE FOR CLOSER TOGETHER WE

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:35.967
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HE'S

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.235
DOING TO TRY AND MOVE IN THIS

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:38.736
DIRECTION.

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:40.104
IT NEEDS TO MOVE A LOT FURTHER

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.339
AYE THESE AREN'T THE ONLY ISSUES

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:43.141
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.175
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:46.077
YOU KNOW WHO PAYS FOR THE

00:30:46.144 --> 00:30:46.978
EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:49.247
LIABILITY THAT'S LIKELY TO COME

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:50.815
OUT OF THE FIRES FROM LAST YEAR.

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:51.749
AND SOME OF THAT AND

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.151
UNFORTUNATELY IS PROBABLY ALSO

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:54.686
GOING TO BE SHARED.

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:56.854
BY CUSTOMERS AND OUR RATES ARE

CUSTOMERS FACE IN ANY OTHER

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.161
STATE AND IN OUR SECTORS.

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:06.064
THANK YOU.

SOONER DOT AYE I WANTED TO POINT

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:22.033
OUT AGAIN THAT YOU KNOW THE BILL

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:24.235
IS AND UTILITIES --

00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:26.137
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:28.105
THIS ISSUE ON YOU KNOW AND AS AS

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:29.240
PEOPLE --

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:31.108
REPRESENTATIVES FROM DISTRICTS

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:31.676
THAT BOTH HAD FIRES RAVAGE

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.244
THROUGH --

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.212
ARE DISTRICTS AND BURNED DOWN

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:36.914
HOMES AND HAD AND WE'VE HAD

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.582
LIVES LOST --

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.084
THE STATUS QUO.

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:43.120
IS UNACCEPTABLE AND YOU KNOW SO.

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:44.622
BUT ONE OF THINGS I DID WANT TO

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.390
POINT OUT HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW.

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.358
THE CURRENT PROCESS HE'S

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.093
OBVIOUSLY AREN'T TAKING CARE OF

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.661
THEM THEY MAY ADDRESS SAFETY --

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:53.030
BUT THEY NO I DON'T THINK WE CAN

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:54.965
BE SATISFIED THE CURRENT PROCESS

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.400
IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THESE

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:57.735
ISSUES AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:59.003
AT THE HEART OF YOUR BILL IS

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.504
THAT WE NEED TO SET --

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:01.906
THE BAR HIGHER --

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:02.773
FOR THE UTILITIES THAT THERE'S

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:03.307
MORE THAN YOU DO THEY NEED

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:06.243
APPROVED MINUTES --

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.511
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A COST

00:39:07.578 --> 00:39:08.713
THAT THERE'S A COST ASSOCIATED

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.715
WITH THAT.

00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:14.385
AND AND YOU KNOW --

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:15.486
AND THE OTHER PART OF IT WHEN I

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.954
HEAR SAN HOME AND THE COSTS ARE

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:18.055
SO HIGH WILL.

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:19.390
THEY'RE NOT HIGH BECAUSE OF THIS

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:20.524
YOU KNOW ME YES THIS IS AN

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.526
ADDITIONAL COST BUT THE REAL

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:23.427
REASON THEIR HIGHS BECAUSE OUR

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:24.528
PS.

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:26.097
AND BECAUSE OF AB THIRTY TWO IN

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:27.331
THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE ALONG

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:28.566
THOSE LINES THAT'S WHY RATES ARE

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:29.934
SO HIGH AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.135
VERY DIFFICULT.

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:33.270
OF FOR FOR MANY DIFFERENT

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:34.105
BUSINESSES DEALING WITH THIS

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:35.906
ISSUE -- BUT

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.608
THE COST OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:41.045
SYSTEM IS SAFE AND THAT ARE.

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:42.847
OUR HOMES OUR FAMILIES ARE SAFE

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:43.481
IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:44.515
BETTER NOW.

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:45.649
WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT MY

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:46.951
CONCERN IS WITH THIS RECENT

00:39:47.017 --> 00:39:48.953
AMENDMENT IT SEEMS THE MAYBE

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:52.690

WHICH THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTED

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.424
WOULDN'T HAPPEN --

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.993
IN FACT IN --

SECTION TWENTY EIGHT NINETY NINE

00:44:57.861 --> 00:44:58.562
POINT FOUR WHICH IS ON PAGE

00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:00.531
FOURTEEN OF THE BILL.

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:02.299
IN LINE'S FOUR THROUGH SIX SAYS

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:03.333
THE COMMISSION SHALL CONDUCT AN

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.402
ANNUAL PROCEEDING. TO REVIEW

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:06.770
EACH UTILITIES COMPLIANCE WITH

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:09.206
ITS PLAN INCLUDING.

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:11.141
A FACTUAL ANALYSIS OF ANY MAJOR

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.076
EVENTS THAT OCCURRED

00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:12.376
[inaudible]

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:13.310
SO [inaudible]

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:16.680
IT'S IT WILL STILL BE THE CASE

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:17.815
AT THE COMMISSION WILL DO IT

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:19.583
AFTER THE FACT REVIEW IF

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.285
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DETERMINE.

00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:22.252
WHETHER THE AGILITY COMPLY WITH

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.587
THIS PLAN ON ONE HAND OR WAS

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:25.089
NEGLIGENT ON THE OTHER.

00:45:25.155 --> 00:45:26.690
SO THAT'S NOT BEING TAKEN OUT OF

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:28.158
OF THE PROCESS THAT'S

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:29.259
SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT AS

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:36.233
SOMETHING THAT WILL OCCUR --

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.034
AND THE SECOND QUESTION YOU

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:40.604
ASKED WAS ABOUT.

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:42.706
BUT I'M I I WANT TO BE.

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:47.311
REALLY FOCUSED ON THE CHANGE IN.

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:49.213
OUR WHAT COMPLIANCE MEANS WHO

00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:50.414
WHAT THAT'S HIM THAT IMPACT

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:50.914
MIGHT END UP BEING FOR

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:52.649
RATEPAYERS I THINK THAT'S WHAT A

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:53.617
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE.

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:54.685
PRETTY PRETTY BROAD CONCERNS

00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:56.386
ABOUT.

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.455
YES AND AND THAT'S WE WE'VE

00:45:58.522 --> 00:45:59.556
HEARD THOSE CONCERNS AND THERE'S

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:00.491
BEEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:01.558
TRY TO ADDRESS IT.

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:03.494
THE LAST SET OF AMENDMENTS WHICH

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.995
ARE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS BEING

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:07.297
OFFERED IN THIS COMMITTEE --

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:07.931
WHICH ARE AT THE VERY END OF THE

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:08.765
BILL [inaudible]

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:11.602
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY INTENT

[inaudible] TO CHANGE.

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:16.507
THE EXISTING UTILITY LIABILITY

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:17.508
FOR NEGLIGENCE IF THEY ARE

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:19.076
NEGLIGENT THEN THIS BILL DOES

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:20.511
NOT PROTECT THEM MOREOVER

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:22.045
SENATOR HILL --

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.247
WHO IS PATIENTLY WAITING TO

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:24.248
PRESENT ONE OF HIS BILLS NOT

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:25.949
THIS ONE SENATOR HILL HAS A BILL

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:28.485
WHICH ALSO EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS?

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:31.522
ANY RECOVER AND RECOVERY. FOR

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:33.123
NEGLIGENCE AND SENATOR DODD IS A

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.857
COAUTHOR THAT BILL [inaudible]

00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:35.859
SO.

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:37.694
WHY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:38.328
EXPRESSED BY THE RATE PER GROUPS

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:39.429
WE'VE?

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:40.898
TAKE A LOT OF AMENDMENTS TO TRY

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.466
TO BE SURE THEIR FEARS ARE NOT

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:44.868
REALIZED ANSWER DOES THAT --

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:46.937
ALSO RELATED EXPEDITED BASIS AND

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:49.406
A LIMITATION ON EVIDENCE.

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:50.841
THERE IS NO LIMITATION THAT

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:53.610
EVIDENCE THE RATE CASE PLAN.

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.779
PROCEEDING --

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:56.847
WE'VE TAKEN A MEMBERS TO

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:57.881
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE FACT

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:59.950
THAT THAT PROCEEDING WILL BE A

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:01.585
FULL BLOWN PROCEEDING --

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.020
IT CAN TAKE AS LONG AS THE

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:04.254
COMMISSION NEEDS TO TAKE WE

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.822
THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT IT

00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:07.391
BEING EXPLAINED TO COMPRESSED.

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:09.092
WE TOOK AMENDMENTS TO SAY WE

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.627
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT BE DONE IN

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:11.628
EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT THEY CAN'T

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:12.963
FINISH IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS TAKE

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.231
AS LONG AS YOU NEED TO STEP BIG

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:15.933
MAKE A FINDING THAT ANY LONGER.

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.034
THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.802
REQUIREMENT THAT EXISTS AT ANY

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:20.003
RATE CASE RIGHT NOW.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:21.371
I WILL THINK YOU I SEE THAT ONE

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:22.306
OF THE OTHER WITNESSES THAT

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:22.940
PROVIDED TESTIMONY HAS A COMMENT

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.775
ON THE IF I IF THE CHAIR DOESN'T

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:27.544
MIND.

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:28.745
I'M FROM MINISTER.

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.948

GONNA NOT YOUR HANDS BEHALF OF

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.317
TERMS -- ON

00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:35.519
YOUR QUESTION REGARDING --

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.888
THE CURRENT PROCESS PROCESS AND

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.823
HOW THE BILL IS CHANGING IT.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.593
THE THE PROPONENT A WITNESS JUST

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:44.294
STATED ABOUT THE NEGLIGENCE.

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:46.563
PIECE THAT IS IN THE AMENDMENTS.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.599
THE USE OF THE WORD NEGLIGENCE

00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:50.267
MEANS THAT THAT PROVISION THAT

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:52.436
LINE ONLY APPLIES TO THE COURT

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.671
PROCEEDING IT DOES NOT TOUCH.

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:56.640
THE CPUC PROCEEDING SO LET ME

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:57.908
JUST BE CLEAR IT SAYS WHERE

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:58.942
WHERE.

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:01.712
UTILITIES FOUND NEGLIGENT AND IT

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:03.847
CAN BE PASSED ON THAT NEGLIGENCE

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:05.249
FINALLY CAN FIND CAN ONLY OCCUR

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:06.950
IN COURT AND MOST OF THESE CASES.

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:08.151
MOST THE LITIGATION THERE

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:09.853
SETTLED OUT OF COURT THERE IS NO

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.154
FINDING OF NEGLIGENCE OR OR NON

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.889
A BUDGETS.

00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:16.159
THE THE KEY THING ON YES THIS

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.761
BILL DOES REQUIRE A REVIEW OF A

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:19.463
MAJOR OF IT THAT IS TRUE

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:19.763
[inaudible]

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.065
DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:23.667
COMMISSION.

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.702
DETERMINATION WOULD NO LONGER BE

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:26.970
ABOUT ALL OF THE FACTS RELATED

00:48:27.037 --> 00:48:29.373
TO THE MAJOR EVENT IT WOULD ONLY

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:31.441
BE ON THE QUESTION WAS THE PLAN

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:32.943
SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH THAT

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.478
IS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN A

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:35.946
FIVE VERY BRIEFLY CAN JUST GIVE

00:48:36.013 --> 00:48:36.680
YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT SOMEONE

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:37.147
REYES TO ME I'VE BEEN.

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:38.548
USING.

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:40.651
THE PLAN REQUIRES THAT A MILLION

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:43.186
TREES ARE CUT BACK.

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.221
FURTHER IF FURTHER CLEARANCE

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:45.922
FROM POWERLINES.

00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:47.824
AND UTILITY CUT BACK.

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:51.428
ALL BUT THREE WOULDN'T THAT.

00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:52.362
THAT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:53.697
COMPLIANCE SOMEBODY WOULD ARGUE

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:54.231
AND SAY THEY SHOULD NOT BE

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.465
LIABLE.

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:56.066
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY ARE

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:57.067
GOING TO HURT.

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:58.568
THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS BILL IS

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.404
THAT HER CURRENT LAW.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.072
THAT MAY BE TRUE HOWEVER IF YOU

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:04.474
LOOK AT ALL THE FACTS WHAT IF.

00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:06.376
THE UTILITY WAS RECEIVING CALLS

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:06.943
FOR CONSUMERS FOR TWO WEEKS

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.378
STRAIGHT.

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:09.379
THAT THOSE THREE TREES THAT THEY

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:10.580
HADN'T CUT BACK.

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.749
WERE SPARKING FIRES.

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:14.785
AND THEY DID NOTHING ABOUT IT.

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:16.286
UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT FACT

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:18.822
WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE CPUC.

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:20.490
UNDER THIS BILL THAT FACT WOULD

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:22.959
NOT BE CONSIDERED IT WOULD ONLY

00:49:23.026 --> 00:49:23.960
BE CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:25.295
THEY'RE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:27.764
AND ONE WOULD ARGUE THAT. THREE

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:28.432
TREES OUT OF A MILLION MIGHT BE

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:30.367
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:32.002
BUT IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T TAKE

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:33.637
THEM AWAY FROM BEING IMPRUDENT

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:35.238
BY NOT RESPONDING TO TWO WEEKS

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:37.207
OF CALLS ARE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:38.241
THREE TREES AND THAT'S A MAJOR

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:39.276
DIFFERENCE.

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:41.378
ARE YOU LOOK AT ALL THE FACTS

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:41.945
AND MAKE A DETERMINATION OF

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:43.013
LIABILITY.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.214
IS CURRENT PROCESS ARE YOU GONNA

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:46.450
LOOK AT STATURE COMPLIANCE WITH

00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:48.652
THE PLAN AND THAT'S IT.

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:49.186
NOT AT THIS BILL DOES AND

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:51.054
HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS.

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:51.955
I THINK YOU ARE AND WHAT THE

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:53.690
COMMITTEE DOES.

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:54.291
TO IS THE WRONG TERM THESE BUT

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:55.192
TO SUFFER.

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:56.059
GOING THROUGH THIS VERY GOING

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:57.194
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.029
DIFFERENT SIDES OF THIS IS.

00:49:59.096 --> 00:49:59.963
I TO USE THE SAME TERMED A

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.465
SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE --

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:03.667
IN PRE MEDIA FOR FOR THAT ISSUE

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:04.668
THAT WERE WERE TRYING TO DEAL%

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:05.669
WITH.

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.137
OUT MR DOT IS THERE I'M NOT

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:08.205
ASKING YOU TO MAKE A CHANGE ARE

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:10.107
TAKEN AMENDMENT BUT I MEAN HOW

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:12.909
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU COULD --

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:15.112
TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OR IS

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:16.546
THIS DEFINITION IN THIS THIS

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.949
PART OF YOUR BILL SOMETHING THAT

00:50:19.015 --> 00:50:20.317
IS MISINTERPRETED OR IT'S NOT

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:21.518
MISINTERPRETED IT YOU JUST CAN'T

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:22.352
CHANGE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:23.420
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ACTUALLY

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:24.855
ACCOMPLISHING A LOT.

00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:26.423
WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER STUFF IN

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.292
YOUR BILL THAT'S VERY GOOD --

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:32.996
BUT THIS MIGHT BE A BIT TOO MUCH.

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:35.098
I I I I I HEAR BOTH SIDES HERE

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:36.933
AND I'LL TELL YOU.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.034
IF WHAT IT TAKES IS TO FIND

00:50:38.101 --> 00:50:39.836
ANOTHER WORD BESIDES NEGLIGENCE

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:41.738
I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH

00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:43.340
THE WITNESS --

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.275
FOR YA FROM TURN BAD --

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:47.144
RESPECT HIM AND AND EXPERIENCE

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.378
THAT HE HAS.

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:50.647
SO THAT MAYBE SOMETHING THAT WE

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:51.915
THAT'S NOT MAYBE SUBWAY NEED TO

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.183
LOOK AT WE WILL LOOK AT THAT I

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.651
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.019
WILL LOOK AT THAT WITH THE

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.087
WORKING THE ASSEMBLY WORKING

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:57.487
GROUP.

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:59.122
I THINK THAT'S YET THAT'S VERY

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:01.358
FAIR I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:02.426
HAVE AN HONEST ARBITER --

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:05.061
THAT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TWO

00:51:05.128 --> 00:51:07.097
TWO ADDRESSED.

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.565
THE THE ISSUE THAT'S BEFORE US

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:11.535
BEFORE WE BRING IT --

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:13.370
TO APPROPRIATIONS PERHAPS OR

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:14.070
MOST CERTAINLY THE ASSEMBLY

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:15.639
FLOOR AYE SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF

00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:17.474
BILL HERE EVEN IF YOU.

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:18.408
DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION OF

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:20.977
THE BILL.

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.746
BUT THAT DOES A LOT OF GOOD I

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:23.847
JUST WANNA MAKE THAT POINT.

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.849
ON I ALSO TRUST THAT YOU'LL WORK

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:28.051
OUT THE CCA ISSUE I THINK THAT'S

00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:29.553
SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY DOABLE

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:30.754
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE YOU'RE

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:32.989
COMMITTED TO IT --

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:34.524
YOU KNOW I I AM JUST REALLY TORN

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:37.160

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.862
COURTESY VOTE TO YOU.

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.263
I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL VOTE ON

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:41.631
IT ON THE FLOOR.

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.767
I HOPE THAT YOU RESOLVE THIS

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:45.335
ISSUE OR DELETE THAT PROVISION

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:46.903
THAT CAUSES A LOT OF

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:49.272
CONSTERNATION ABOUT A FIFTEEN OF

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:52.909
THE COST. TO RATEPAYERS AND I

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:53.677
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:56.112
EVERYONE WHO WE REPRESENT SHOULD

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:57.113
BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

MOVE ON I KNOW THAT THIS COULD

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:35.852
POTENTIALLY OR WHAT I'M TOLD BY.

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:36.920

THE CHOICE THEY'RE SEEKING RIGHT

NOW.

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:51.368

AND SENATOR DODD I'LL JUST

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:56.540
QUICKLY ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH A

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:57.908
LOT THAT WERE MADE PRIOR TO ME --

00:52:57.974 --> 00:53:00.143
IN PARTICULAR ON THE CCA'S YOU

95% OF MY DISTRICT IS COVERED BY

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:04.247
CITY IS THE OTHER 5% IS GOVERNED

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.348
BY MUNICIPALLY OWNED UTILITY --

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:07.551
SO IF THAT CAN'T GET WORKED OUT

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:08.785
THEN I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:10.387
THE BILL MOVING FORWARD --

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:12.255
I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY --

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:13.323
AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.558
YOU WORKOUT ON THAT AS WELL AS

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:16.560
ON THE RATE PAYER A CONCERNS

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:17.727
THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY ONE OF MY

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:19.796
COLLEAGUES AND AND YOU'RE

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:21.064
HOPEFULLY EVEN.

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:22.766
ONCE THEN RESULT IS HAS BEEN

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.134
IMPROVED ALL HAVE IT --

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.603
THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT IT AGAIN

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.971
MOVING FORWARD THINK HE'S

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:28.271
[inaudible]

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:33.944
MISTER COOLEY.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.012
I'VE GOT QUESTIONS REGARDING THE

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.614
AMENDMENTS BUT MY GENERAL VIEW

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:38.915
IN THIS AREA I THINK IS THAT THE

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:41.051
PUBLIC.

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.352
WILL GO ALONG WITH SAFETY IF

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:44.287
THEY FEEL THERE'S A REASONABLE

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:46.456
SHARON OF THE PAIN.

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:48.658
I'M CONCERNED THAT THE

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.528
SHAREHOLDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY.

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:53.296
ON THE HOOK.

00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:55.899
EVEN NO THEY MAKE THE INVESTMENT

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:56.700
THEY STAND TO GAIN BASED ON

00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:59.469
THEIR INVESTMENT --

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:01.204
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:03.406
WHERE WE'RE PUTTING RATES THAT

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:04.274
THE RATE STRUCTURE OTHER

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:05.809
RATEPAYERS.

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.143
BUT THE SHAREHOLDER SORT OF OUR

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.545
ENSLAVED FROM THE OFFICE SUITE

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:09.679
DEAL IF YOU'RE A SHAREHOLDER

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.181
HERE.

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.716
YOU GENERALLY YOU PUT UP YOUR

00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:14.017
CAPITAL YOU TAKE YOUR RISK AND

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:15.819
YOU GET A RETURN.

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:16.453
AND HERE THIS WOULD BE REMOVING

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:17.754
NAY.

00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:20.023
HUGE RISK COMPONENT FROM THAT

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:20.991
CAPITAL INVESTMENT BY

00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:21.491
SHAREHOLDER.

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:26.062
AND ARM IN GENERAL I THINK THAT.

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:27.497
THE REVIEWS BY THE PUBLIC WOULD

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.199
BE SKATING.

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:30.900
IF THEY SEE THEIR RATES GOING UP

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.035
AND IT COMES OUT THAT THE

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:32.736
SHAREHOLDERS WERE SORT OF

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:36.206
INSULATED FROM SHARON THAT.

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:38.308
AND THEN SIDE JUST A GENERALIZED

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:39.843
OBSERVATION THAT GIVES ME SOME

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:41.277
CONCERN HERE.

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:42.512
THE MORE PARTICULAR THING IS I

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:47.083
READ THE ANALYSIS AND THE

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.985
ACCORDING TO YOU WHEN YOU ANY

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:50.887
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS JUST LAST

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:53.189
DECEMBER A P. YOU SEE PROCESS

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:55.125
COMPLETED ITSELF [inaudible]

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:57.394
ESTABLISHING --

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.697

AND SYSTEMATIC WAY I GUESS AND

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.238
IDENTIFY WHERE THE HIGH FIRE

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:09.706

THIS IS SIX MONTHS OLD THIS BODY

00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:13.410
OF WORK.

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:15.111
WHICH WOULD SEEM TO SAY THERE

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.379
ARE SOME JUST SOME EFFORT TO

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:18.181
KINDA LOOK AROUND CALIFORNIA C.

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.916

I I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:54.984
CLIMATE ZONE MEANS.

00:55:55.051 --> 00:56:05.562
IN RELATION TO THE EXISTING WORK.

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:06.663
JEFF YESTERDAY ABOUT WHAT IS

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:11.267

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:14.137
NECESSARILY THE HIGH FIRE

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:14.604
THROUGHOUT [inaudible]

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:16.639
DISTRICTS.

00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:18.208
OKAY MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:21.144
RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION --

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:22.946
ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY.

00:56:23.012 --> 00:56:25.548
THE COMMISSION ALREADY USES A

00:56:25.615 --> 00:56:27.584
SET OF CLIMATE ZONES.

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:30.186
SEC BASELINE RATES --

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:32.021
AND THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOME

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:33.223
AREAS THE STATE ARE HARDER THAN

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:34.424
OTHERS SOME AREAS A COOLER THEY

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:35.558
HAVE DIFFERENT WEATHER.

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:37.227
AND SO TO SET A BASELINE USAGE

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:38.661
RATES THE COMMISSION HAS A

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:39.963
SERIES OF CLIMATE ZONES AND SO

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:41.464
WE AND WE SPECIFICALLY AND

00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:42.465
INTENTIONALLY ADOPTED.

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:45.401
AN EXISTING STRUCTURE SO THAT WE

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:46.436
WOULDN'T BE INVENTING ANY NEW WE

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:47.670
ALSO WOULDN'T CRANNY THE

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:48.938
ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY OR

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:50.240
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN.

00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:51.908
AND IT BE USING SOMETHING THAT.

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:53.209
EVERYBODY AT THE P. YOU SEEN

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:55.211
KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS --

00:56:55.278 --> 00:56:58.081
AND THEY ARE RELEVANT --

00:56:58.148 --> 00:56:59.182
TO THE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:01.885
AREAS IN THE STATE.

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:04.120
HOUSES CORRESPOND TO THE HIGH

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:05.722
FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS TO NEW

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:09.292
WORK OF THE P. UC --

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.827
IT THE REALITY IS THAT WOULD

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:12.428
SEEM TO RELATE TO THE COST IF

00:57:12.495 --> 00:57:13.696
YOU YES FOR SURE --

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:15.665
AND WHAT WE SAW WITH THE NEW

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:17.967
MAPS IS AN AWFUL LOT OF THE

00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:19.736
STATE IS A HIGH FIRE RISKS KNOWN

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:21.504
AT THIS POINT --

00:57:21.571 --> 00:57:23.406
AND SO MOST OF THE CLIMATE ZONES

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:24.941
WILL PROBABLY HAVE HIGH FIRE

00:57:25.008 --> 00:57:26.910
RISK IN THEM --

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:27.544
THAT'S THE REALITY WE FACE RIGHT

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:28.978
NOW.

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:30.980
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE --

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:32.615
EQUAL RISK OR THE COST SHOULD BE

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:33.416
SHARED EQUALLY OR INVESTMENT

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:35.018
SHOULD BE SHARED EQUALLY.

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:36.519
BUT PART OF THE AMENDMENT THAT

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:37.987
WAS PROPOSED TODAY.

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:40.123
IS TO CORRELATE WHERE THE

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.858
INVESTMENTS ARE MADE --

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:42.992
WITH WHO'S PAYING FOR THEM SO

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.427
THAT PEOPLE HAVE A REAL CLOSE

00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:46.329
RELATIONSHIP.

00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:47.897
AND AS YOU SAID IN A PEOPLE

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:48.531
GOING TO PAY FOR SAFETY THAT ARE

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:49.632
GETTING --

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:50.867
AND WE WANTED.

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:58.341
CAPITALIZE ON THE FACT

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:58.641
[inaudible]

00:57:58.708 --> 00:57:59.375

WHICH KILEY.

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:07.984
I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE MORE

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:10.086
CLARITY ON THIS DISPUTE OVER THE

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:12.121
LIABILITY STANDARD SO WE HEARD

00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:13.022
FROM THE PROPONENTS THAT THEY'RE

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:14.090
STILL GONNA BE A NEGLIGENCE

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:15.792
STANDARD AYE IN COURT AND THE

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.694
RESPONSE FROM THE WITNESS --

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.762
FROM TURN IS THAT --

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:22.699
MOST OF THOSE CASES OF COURSE

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:24.500
THAT'S TRUE KIND OF IN ANY KIND

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.870
OF LITIGATION AND I YOU KNOW THE

00:58:26.936 --> 00:58:28.838
THE LIABILITY STANDARD AT PARIS

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:31.074
ON NOT ON THE TERMS OF THE

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:31.875
SETTLEMENT SO.

00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:32.775
COULD YOU JUST MAKE IT A LITTLE

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:35.612
MORE I STILL MORE EXPLICITLY WHY

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:37.680
YOU THINK THAT HAVING AYE AYE

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.883
NEGLIGENCE STANDARD IN --

00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:41.017
IN THE CONTEXT OF A COURT

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:42.685
PROCEEDING AS OPPOSED TO A CPUC

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:45.388
PROCEEDING IS IN A SUFFICIENTLY --

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:49.359
POWERFUL LEVER TO INDUCE --

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:51.060
EFFICIENCY IF YOU MEASURES

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:51.361
[inaudible]

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:54.130
IF YOU.

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:54.731
IF I MAY UM FINDER SENATE THE

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:56.165
QUESTION I DON'T.

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:57.367
KNOW THAT WOULD MAKE A STATEMENT

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:59.469
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:01.337
NEGLIGENCE STANDARD SHOULD BE.

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:02.605
CHANGED OR THE USE OF THE

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:03.473
NEGLIGENCE STANDARD SHOULD BE

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.275
CHANGED I THINK MY COMMENT WAS

00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:07.844
THAT AT LEAST UNDER CURRENT LAW.

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:08.678
THERE'S A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:09.879
THAT.

00:59:09.946 --> 00:59:11.214
CAN BE USED IN COURT BUT IF THE

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:14.250
CPC THE STANDARD IS --

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:14.550
IS -- ONE OF

00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:16.286
PRUDENCE.

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:17.620
WHETHER YOU TO ACT PRUDENTLY OR

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:18.855
NOT AND SELL MY REFERENCE THE

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:19.856
WORD NEGLIGENCE IN THE PROPOSED

00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:21.491
AMENDMENTS.

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:22.959
WAS THAT THE IMPACT OF THAT

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.994
AMENDMENT WOULD ONLY BE ON IN

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:27.630
COURT LITIGATION AS OPPOSED TO

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:30.566
IS THE PRECEDING THE CPUC.

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:31.701
AND MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD --

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:32.869
RESPOND TO THAT.

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:34.637
THE COMMISSION FINDS NEGLIGENCE.

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.673
ALL THE TIME.

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.675
EDISON WAS FOUND NEGLIGENT FOR

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:39.309
ITS HANDLING OF THE SENATE KNOW

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:40.677
FREE --

00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:42.779
STEAM GENERATOR FAILURE.

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:44.480
P. GINNY WAS FOUND NEGLIGENT BY

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:46.282
THE PC FOR THE EXPLOSION IN SAN

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:47.183
BRUNO.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.519
SO IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE THAT

00:59:49.585 --> 00:59:50.820
NEGLIGENCE REFERS ONLY TO A

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:52.422
COURT PROCEEDING IT'S SOMETHING

00:59:52.488 --> 00:59:53.756
THE COMMISSION DOES AND HAS DONE

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:55.758
IN THE PAST AND YOU KNOW IF

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:56.926
NECESSARY I PRESUME WILL

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:58.194
CONTINUE TO DO IN THE FUTURE SO

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:58.728
THE THAT.

00:59:58.795 --> 00:59:59.729
DICHOTOMY THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.698
HERE JUST IS NOT ACCURATE MISTER

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.266
CHAIRMAN IF IT ENDED IN ADDITION

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.968
TO THAT THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.235
GIVEN EARLIER BY THE TURN.

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:08.972
WITNESS STATING THAT IF.

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:10.873
THE UTILITY HAD BEEN NOTIFIED

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.775
THAT THERE WAS A PARKING POWER

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.777
LINE AND THEY DID NOTHING THAT

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.379
THIS BILL WOULD EXEMPT THEM.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.181
I WOULD BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.616
PAGE.

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.218
FIFTEEN LINES FIVE THROUGH SIX

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.287
WHAT SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.888
ONE OF THE DISQUALIFIER SO

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:26.856
UTILITY.

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:28.524
WOULD BE IF THEY HAD ADVANCE

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:31.094
NOTICE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES CAN

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.596
CONSTITUTING NONCOMPLIANCE.

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.331
SO THE EXAMPLE EGGS THE

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:37.767
IDENTICAL EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.435
IS EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED IN THE

HEALTH ROLE VIS A VIS THE PUBLIC

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:39.674
POLICY DEVELOPMENT IS TO

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:41.109
CAREFULLY REVIEW THE SCIENTIFIC

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:43.010
EVIDENCE ALLOWING US TO ASSESS

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:44.445
THE POTENTIAL IMPACT.

01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:45.947
ON THE CITIZENS OF CHANGES TO

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:47.715
PUBLIC POLICY BEING PROPOSED

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:49.517
THROUGH LEGISLATION AND TO

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.185
ENSURE THAT YOU S. LEGISLATORS

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:52.453
HAVE THE FACTS BEFORE MAKING A

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.488
DECISION.

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.022
THE POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACT OF

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:56.724
NINE OH FIVE IS CLEAR.

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.392
OVER FORTY YEARS OF PEER

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:00.194
REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC DATA

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:01.963
CONFIRMS THAT EXTENDING ALCOHOL

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:04.198
SALES TO FOUR AM WOULD MEAN MORE

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:06.234
INTOXICATED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.035
MORE DO YOU AYE CRASHES MORE

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:10.138
PERSONAL INJURIES ER VISITS MORE

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:12.507
DEATHS MORE VIOLENT CRIME.

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:14.308
THIS HEALTH BURDEN WOULD BE BORN

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:15.643
NOT JUST BY THE RESIDENTS OF THE

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.745
PILOT COUNTIES BUT BY THOSE OF

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:19.347
SURROUNDING COUNTIES INTO WHICH

01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:20.782
INTO WHICH LATE NIGHT DRINKERS

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:22.049
MAY TRAVEL.

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:24.185
YOUR JOB IS LEGISLATORS IS TO A

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:25.953
WAVE OF THIS POTENTIAL HEALTH

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.255
BURDEN AGAINST THE POTENTIAL

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:28.156

01:30:28.222 --> 01:30:29.590

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:38.499
IN DOING SO I URGE YOU TO

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:40.168
CONSIDER THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:41.169
NOT SIMPLY ANOTHER SPECIAL

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:42.703
INTEREST.

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:44.438
IT IS THE BEST EXPRESSION OF

01:30:44.505 --> 01:30:46.174
SOCIETY'S INTEREST IN THE COMMON

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.141
GOOD.

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:48.776
IN ASSURING THE CONDITIONS IN

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:50.545

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.647
ACHIEVE MAXIMUM HEALTH AS SUCH

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:53.447
WE BELIEVE THAT HEALTH

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.716
CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD ALWAYS

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:57.485
TRUMP THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS.

IT'S HEALTH VERSUS PROFITS

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.326
CHOICE SHOULD BE EASY NO ONE

NINE OH FIVE THANKS.

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:11.699
GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LYNN

SACRAMENTO.

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:20.007
MATT CALIFORNIA OPPOSES SENATE

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:22.476
BILL NINE ZERO FIVE CALIFORNIA

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:23.878
SHOULD RETAIN A UNIFORM BAR

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:24.779
CLOSING.

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.114
TIME TO HELP PREVENT BAR HOPPING

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:28.449

CLOSING TIME.

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:32.920
WITH THIS BILL NEIGHBORING

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:34.789
CITIES COULD FACE A SPILL OVER

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:37.058
EFFECT IN INCREASED DEMAND ON

01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:38.159
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:39.460
RESOURCES NEEDED TO KEEP ROADS

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:41.929
SAFE.

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.397
WE'VE ALSO HEARD THE ARGUMENT

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:44.966
THAT EXTENDING BAR HOURS WOULD

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:46.934
ELIMINATE THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:48.402
AND OF POTENTIAL RUSH.

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:49.704
OF DRUNK DRIVERS LEAVING THE

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.172
BARS AT TWO A. M..

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:52.974
QUITE FRANKLY OUR ROADS ARE

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.142
RELATIVELY UNOCCUPIED TO A. M.

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:57.778
AS COMPARED TO FOUR AND FIVE AM.

01:31:57.845 --> 01:32:00.615
CALIFORNIA STILL HAD OVER ONE

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:01.449
THOUSAND FATALITIES ON OUR

01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:04.118
ROADWAYS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:06.287
DUE TO DUI CRASHES THAT'S A

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:10.391
SIXTEEN POINT 2% INCREASE OVER.

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:10.925
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THIS

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:12.026
LEGISLATION WILL PUT FRESHLY

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:13.761
IMPAIRED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD AT

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:15.563
THE TIME OF DAY WHEN COMMUTERS.

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.736
OUR ROADWAYS.

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:23.070
AGAIN THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:25.006
RESEARCH DOES NOT INDICATE THAT

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:26.274
EXTENDING HOURS WOULD MAKE US

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.208
SAFER.

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:28.209
RATHER THE RESEARCH SHOWS THE

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:30.311
OPPOSITE.

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.246
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:35.082
WERE TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:36.584
NINETY SEVEN PEOPLE.

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:38.085
KILLED ON OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS

01:32:38.152 --> 01:32:40.521
DUE TO DO YOU AYE CRASHES.

01:32:40.588 --> 01:32:42.156
AN AVERAGE OF ONE ALCOHOL

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:43.824
IMPAIRED DRIVING FATALITY OCCURS

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:45.927
EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES.

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:47.361
SO FOR EVERY FIFTY MINUTES THAT

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.297
WE SIT HERE.

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:50.631
SOMEONE IS BEING KILLED IN

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:54.068
IMPAIRED DRIVING CRASH.

01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:55.303
AND REMEMBER THESE ARE JUST

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:56.671
NUMBERS THEY IS THERE'S ART

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:57.905
NUMBERS AT ALL THEY'RE HUMAN

01:32:57.972 --> 01:32:59.740

THERE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND LIKE

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:05.713
ME.

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.114
THIS BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:08.749
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRAGEDIES

01:33:08.816 --> 01:33:10.518
ON CALIFORNIA'S ROADS MOTHERS

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:11.719

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:13.254
RESPECTFULLY URGES ARE

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:14.956
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS TO VOTE

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:15.523
NO.

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:16.824
ON SENATE BILL NINE ZERO FIVE

01:33:16.891 --> 01:33:22.263
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.231
I GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:25.099
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME

IS CARSON BENEFITS FREDRICKSON

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:28.869
HERE FROM ALCOHOL JUSTICE --

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:30.538
THE FACT THAT EXTENDING LAST

01:33:30.604 --> 01:33:31.806
CALL TIMES CAUSES HARM IS REALLY

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:33.374
NOT UP FOR DEBATE WE HAVE

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:34.809
RESEARCH INDEPENDENT AND PEER

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:37.044
REVIEWED FROM FOUR CONTINENTS

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:37.812
LOOKING AT HALF A CENTURY OF

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:38.646
DATA.

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.481
ALL THAT DEMONSTRATES THIS.

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:41.916
DISCUSSION STARTS BUT

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:43.284
IMPORTANTLY DOES NOT END WITH

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:45.086
ANNE MARIE CRASHES.

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:46.654
SO CALIFORNIA IS IN A PRETTY

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:48.222
MUCH ON THAT KNOWLEDGE CRASH

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:50.591
CRISIS ARE THE MOST RECENT ODS

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:51.625
REPORT HAD INTOXICATED TALLIES

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:54.028
UP 20% OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.830
THESE ARE VERY DRAMATIC ENDS TO

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:57.098
A NIGHT OUT AND THAT WE'LL SEE

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:58.532
MORE OF THEM WITH LITTLE LAST

01:33:58.599 --> 01:33:59.667
CALL TIMES ACCORDING TO

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:00.167
INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:01.669
SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED BY OVER

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:02.903
A DOZEN AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:03.971
EXPERTS.

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:06.007
AS THE CDC COMMITTEE THAT DOCTOR

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:07.441
CASTLE LAUNCHES REFERRING.

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:09.310
TO I IN THIS CASE COMMONSENSE

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:10.745
ALIGNS WITH THE RESEARCH BOTH

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:11.812
COMMONSENSE AND RESEARCH SHOW

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.481
THAT PARTY HOTSPOTS ATTRACT

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:15.583
PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY CAN'T BUDGET

01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:16.951
FOR CAR SERVICE THEY WILL DRINK

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:18.319
MORE THAN IF THE BAR CLOSED IT.

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:19.420
TOO THERE WILL BE MORE EXHAUSTED

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.188
WHEN DRIVING HOME AND THAT WILL

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.189
LEAD TO MORE DE WISE AND MORE

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:23.924
CRASHES.

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:27.161
BUT PRESSURES ARE NOT THE ONLY

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:27.795
HARM THEY'RE NOT EVEN THE CHIEF

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:27.995
HARM.

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:28.562
THE EVIDENCE OF SPIKES IN

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:29.263
INJURIES AND CRIME IS

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.865
OVERWHELMING AYE WE'VE SEEN THIS

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:32.433
IN NEW YORK THERE'S A STUDY --

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.301
THAT THAT NEW YORK HAS THE SORT

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:34.935
OF LOCAL CONTROL STATE THAT WERE

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.637
SO.

01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:38.506
SOSA I SEE AS AN IDEAL.

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:41.308
AND THERE THAT THAT EXTRA HOUR

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:42.777
OPEN AFTER ONE THE START EACH

01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.045
EXTRA HOUR AFTER ONE A AND NEED

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:44.912
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VIOLENT

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:45.813
CRIMES.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.283
BELIEVE IT'S ALMOST FIVE PER.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.151
HUNDRED THOUSAND THE TOTAL COST

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:51.018
OF THIS IS TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:52.553
DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.988
THIS AND AT THIS ANALYSIS DID

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:55.923
NOT INCLUDE NEW YORK CITY.

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.158
I YOU CAN LOOK --

01:34:57.224 --> 01:34:58.959
ELSEWHERE CHEN IN NORWAY --

01:34:59.026 --> 01:34:59.894
THERE WAS A PATCHWORK OF

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.829
EXTENDED RETRACTED LAST CALL

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:03.764
TIMES EVERY HOUR FUTURES

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:06.000
EXTENDED ADDED 17% OF THE RATE

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:09.003
OF ASSAULTS --

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:10.538
EVERY HOURS ATTRACTED DECREASED

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:13.207
ASSAULT BY 21% IN THE IN IN

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:15.676
AMSTERDAM WHICH A YOU KNOW MOST

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:17.445
WAS HE IS A GLOBAL CITY.

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:18.612
THEY THEY CREATED IN FACT

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:20.181
EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF UP

01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:22.249
PARTY ZONES THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:24.185
CREATE AND SAW THAT THOSE RESULT

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.786
IN 34% INCREASE IN LATE NIGHT

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.388
AMBULANCE CALLS.

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:28.956
THESE FIGURES ARE JUST A SMALL

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:31.992
SAMPLE OF THE FORTY OR FIFTY

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:32.760
THAT OUR BY THE REFER TO BY

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:34.862
EXPERTS.

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:36.564
ALSO WITH THAT MIND WE WE WE

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:37.932
OBJECTED TO SOME OF THE SERB

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:38.966
MISUSE OF SCIENTIFIC TERMS IN

THIS ISSUE ARE AND IF I WOULD

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:22.135
NOT BE PROPOSING A BILL. TO

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:25.839
I AND I DO NOT THINK I DON'T

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:28.141

TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THE

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:34.975
ALLIES TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:36.276

CDC AND WHAT THAT SHOWS

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:37.464
CONCLUSIVELY IS THAT THERE IS

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:38.098
HARM KEEPING THE BARS OPEN LATER

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:38.398

AT IN THESE ESTABLISHMENTS IT

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:53.080
WOULD BE QUITE EMPTY AND AS

01:45:53.146 --> 01:45:54.247
MILLENNIAL IT'S BEEN MY

01:45:54.314 --> 01:45:55.515
OBSERVATION THAT I'VE SEEN

01:45:55.582 --> 01:45:57.651
INDIVIDUALS TYPICALLY GOING OUT

01:45:57.718 --> 01:45:58.185

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:02.889
THAT OCCURS LAST CALL MAYBE AT

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:03.724
ONE THIRTY SO WE'RE ONLY TALKING

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:05.826
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF.

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.627
TO CONSUME YOUR BEVERAGE OR TWO

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:10.163

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:13.033
HAVE AN INTEREST YOUR RESPONSES

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.202
THAT WITH SUCH A SMALL SHORT

01:46:15.268 --> 01:46:16.269
PERIOD WE KNEW OF TIME.

01:46:16.336 --> 01:46:18.605
THAT IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:19.773
INDIVIDUALS WHO IS ACTUALLY

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.274
COUNTER INTUITIVE TO WHAT YOU

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:22.676
WERE SUGGESTING WHICH IS.

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:24.144
TO THIS IF WE WERE TO SUPPORT

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:25.212
THE BILL AND ALLOW FOR AN

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:26.413
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.348
INDIVIDUALS DON'T AS USE MENTION

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:29.583
FEEL LIKE THEY NEED.

01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:32.853
TO CHOW DOWN AND CONTINUE TO

01:46:32.919 --> 01:46:36.423
FELLOW FIND AN OPERA FAST PACED

01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:38.058
RATHER THAN HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:39.126
ABSORB --

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:41.194
THAT THAT ALCOHOL AND OR HOW

01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:42.796
THAT HAS APPEARED OF TIME AND OR

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:44.798

01:46:48.101 --> 01:46:49.936
OTHER CONFLICTING EVIDENCE TO TO

01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:51.371
A BEST INDICATE THAT IN FACT IN

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:53.273
ACTUALITY THAT THAT IS NOT THE

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.775
CASE IN IN CURRENT REALITY IN

01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:55.642
EXISTENCE IF.

01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:56.777

ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF ANYBODY

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:02.849
HERE IS NOT REALLY RELEVANT

01:47:02.916 --> 01:47:04.050
WHAT'S RELEVANT IS WHAT THE

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:05.886
RESEARCH IS FROM THE CDC AND THE

01:47:05.952 --> 01:47:06.720
CDC.

01:47:06.787 --> 01:47:08.455

BASED ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IS

01:48:14.921 --> 01:48:17.057
SAYING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE'S

01:48:17.123 --> 01:48:18.124
PATTERNS OF HOW THEY DRINK OF

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:20.794
DRAMATICALLY CHANGE IN ADDITION.

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:22.262
I'VE LOVED.

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:23.797
I'VE BEEN IN OTHER STATES LIKE

01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:26.132
FLORIDA --

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:27.300
WERE YOU EVERYBODY THAT CARD AND

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:28.869

LONG AS THE DRIVERS NOT DRINKING.

01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:33.206
THAT'S LEGAL I'VE BEEN AND

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:34.708
LOUISIANA WHERE YOU PULL UP WE

01:48:34.774 --> 01:48:37.410
GET UP MARGARITA LIKE IT.

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:38.311
LIKELY DRIVE TO LOOK AT TACO

01:48:38.378 --> 01:48:40.680
BELL AND SO I'VE SEEN SOME

01:48:40.747 --> 01:48:42.749
REALLY ABHORRENT WAYS OF DOING

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:44.651
THIS I DON'T SEE THAT.

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:45.418
IN YOUR BILL ESPECIALLY STATE

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:47.587
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GATHERING

01:48:47.654 --> 01:48:49.322
DATA THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:50.824

ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON --

01:48:52.425 --> 01:48:53.727
ASKED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK

01:48:53.793 --> 01:48:55.695
LA AND THE OTHER CITIES WILL BE

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:57.864
PERFECT EXAMPLES OF HOW WE CAN

01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:00.767
ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS AND SEE --

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:02.736
WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON

01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:03.837
HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT?

01:49:03.904 --> 01:49:05.305
THE OTHER THING IS ALSO BEING

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:06.373

JURISDICTIONS A LOCAL COUNCIL

01:49:12.078 --> 01:49:14.547

01:49:14.614 --> 01:49:16.149
DEVELOP A PLAN.

01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:17.884
WORKING WITH CH P. AND OTHERS SO

01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:20.387
THAT WILL BE THE SAFEST.

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:22.589
POSSIBLE SITUATION GROW FROM TWO
