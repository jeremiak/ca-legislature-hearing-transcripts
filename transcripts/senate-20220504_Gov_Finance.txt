YOU GOT THE HIM YEAH THAT MADAM CHAIR THIS IS VERY URGENT I'VE CENTER- I WAS ALSO VERY GOOD WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MOVE THE BILL I HAVE A THERE IS A MOTION WELL WELL WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR HERTZBERG CENTER YOU'RE AWESOME YES- A QUESTION- CENTER. NUMBER- OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE REALLY PRECIOUS TO US EVEN IN THESE- AND FORCING TIMES. IT'S COULD YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY YOU THINK A TAX CREDIT. IS SO IMPORTANT TO THIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND IT IS A AND A GLAD TO HEAR IT'S HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IS CREATING THOUSANDS OF JOBS. SOMETIMES OUR TAX CREDITS AIMED AT AND IN. THAT WE MAY BE LOSING OR IS GETTING ATTRACTED FROM TAX CREDITS LIKE THE FILM TAX CREDIT IN ANOTHER PART OF THIS. COUNTRY SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT WHY AND- SOMETIMES THERE'S A THRESHOLD AS TO BUSINESSES UNDER CERTAIN AMOUNT OR BUSINESSES- OF THAT REACH THAT THRESHOLD COULD. YOU EXPLAIN A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY. WE WOULD E GIVING A TAX CREDIT TO OUR SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY BUT- THERE'S TWO REASONS THAT I CAN THINK OF- THE FIRST REASON IS IT IS IT IS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY- ALTHOUGH IT IS GROWING HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THERE'S NO. SORT OF. INHERENT REASON WHY IT SHOULD BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT FOR HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE OTHER- INCENTIVES THAT REMAIN HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE COULD MOVE THE TAXES THAT COULD MOVE THE NUMBER OF OTHER. OTHER AREAS- THE SECOND REASON IS THIS IS AN EXISTING TAX CREDIT BY BASICALLY DISALLOWING IT ONE IT CREATES CONFUSION. BUT TO IT SENDS A VERY STRONG MESSAGE THAT TELL. IS ANTAGONISTIC IF WE IF WE BASICALLY REVERSAL DONE THE PAST WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WERE ACTUALLY ANTAGONISTIC. TO THE INDUSTRY AND SO- RATHER THAN SEND THAT MESSAGE I SUGGEST THAT WE- EXTEND THE CREDIT THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS. AND IT'S RELATIVELY LIMITED EXPANSION AS TO- FACILITIES ARE ON THE GROUND IN THIRDLY I SUPPOSE- IT WOULD SEEM A BIT BIZARRE IF WE START TAXING THINGS IN SPACE AND ABSENT I AM INFORMED ABSENT THIS TAX CREDIT WOULD ACTUALLY BE. TAXING PERSONAL PROPERTY ONCE FROM CALIFORNIA THAT'S IN SPACE THIS STATE PRIDES ITSELF WITH BEING AT THE VANGUARD AND CERTAINLY THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD REMAIN THE VANGUARD. AND I'M NOT THE GREATEST FAN OF TAX CREDITS. BUT THEY HAVE THEIR PLACE. AND THIS IS MORE THAN SYMBOLIC I CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIVE. THE COST OF THIS INDUSTRY ARE INCREDIBLE LIKEWISE INCREDIBLE. BUT THEN SO ARE THE BENEFITS I THINK OF A HOLE IN THAT INDUSTRY BASED IN THE STATE. CONTINUE OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION. NOBODY FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION SHOWED UP THERE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION BUT I'M INCREDULOUS THAT THEY OPPOSED THIS. AND I'D LIKE THEM TO COME AND EXPLAIN WHY IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE AN INTEREST. IN THIS OPPOSING THIS BILL. CENDRILLON BURKE I HAVE DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT YOUR LEGISLATION THANK YOU SIR. WELL I JUST HAVE TO- AGREE THAT- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ON THE VANGUARD MY FATHER WORKED IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND SO I REMEMBER WHEN- THEY WERE MAJOR- COMPANIES THAT HIRED ENGINEERS THAT DID THE WORK HERE. AND THAT ALSO DID THAT THE TESTING RIGHT OUT ON THE AIR AIRFORCE BASE- AND A LOT OF THAT LEFT WHEN WE LEFT THERE. THE SPACE RACE- I DID HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK AND MY ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS WHY DO YOU NEED THIS. I'M QUITE FRANKLY THERE BEING- ENCOURAGED TO MOVE TO OTHER STATES WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING GIVEN- CREDITS BENEFITS- MONEY AND- AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE INDUSTRY'S WE REALLY NEED TO KEEP HER BECAUSE- THEY HAVE THE DATE ALTHOUGH IT'S LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- THAT THE LIST OF SUPPLIERS. IS STATEWIDE AND THEY'RE JUST AS MANY- SUPPLIERS OF TALENT AND EQUIPMENT FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THERE FOR SENATE FROM SAID FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE- TAX CREDITS TO MAKE SENSE- AND DIE WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS THE BILL TODAY AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS KEPT THEM HERE AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD. IDEA TO- TO CONTINUE DOING THAT SO THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR HERTZBERG- THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON ON APPROACH KINS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATORS CAPITO HI CABALLERO I NIELSEN AYE NIELSEN AYE DOURADO ROSATO I HERTZBERG. HERTZBERG FIVE WINNER.

BORDER ZERO FOUR EYES NOSE NO ZERO WE WILL LEAVE THAT THE ROLE OPEN. I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BILL CENTER MCGUIRE S. B. TEN SEVENTY FOUR. WELCOME. GOOD MORNING AT VENTURE MR BY SHARE IS IT ALL RIGHT TO PROCEED YES YOU MAY LONG TIME NO TALK MANAGER YES- WOULD LIKE EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING HOW DO. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY AYE THINKING ABOUT HIM CHAIR- AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE INCREDIBLE WORK ON THE BILL. THAT YOU HAVE BEEN I SINCERELY ENGAGING I'M GRATEFUL. AND I TRULY WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE STAFF AS WELL WELL WE HAVE COURSE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE. AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. VENTURE SB TEN SEVENTY FOUR IT'S GONNA LUMINATE THE EXISTING WEIGHT BASED CANNABIS CULTIVATION TAX. IN ROLE THE GOLDEN STATE'S CANNABIS TAXES INTO A SINGLE PERCENTAGE BASED EXCISE TAXES WOULD BE TIME TO SAIL. THE BILL HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING AS CALIFORNIA HAS A- STORAGE IN CHALLENGE HISTORY ON CAMPUS WHICH WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED PROP SIXTY FOUR WHICH LEGALIZED COMMERCIAL DUAL USE CANNABIS FOR FOLKS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. THE ACT ALLOWS FOR THE LICENSE. REGULATION OF BOTH COMMERCIAL ADULT USE IN MEDICINAL USE CANNABIS ACTIVITIES- BUT- THE CHALLENGE WITH PROP SIXTY FOUR IT PUT THE STATE UNDER SOME RIDICULOUS. TIME LINES TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THIS IS LITERALLY MEET MEANT THAT THE STATE HAS TO BUILD THE PLANE. AS WE ARE FINDING. A WHILE WE'VE TRIED TO FIX ALL THE ISSUES WERE PROP SIXTY FOUR SINCE HIS PASSAGE. OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST REMAINING CHALLENGES IS THE TAX STRUCTURE. THE PRODUCTS A SIXTY FOUR CONTAIN TO SPECIFIC TO THIS. ADDRESS THE EXCISE TAX IS WELLS THE CULTIVATION TAX. AND THE EXCISE TAX IS AT A SEPT FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF THE GROSS RECEIPT OF ANY CANNABIS OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS. AT THE TIME OF SALE. THE CULTIVATION TAX IS WEIGHT BASED ITS CHARGE PER OUNCE ON HARVESTED CANNABIS. SO CURRENTLY THE CHALLENGE. WITH THE CULTIVATION TAXES. IT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR WHEN PRICE OF CANNABIS. IN PRICES HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN HALF IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. IN THE CULTIVATION TAX PER WEIGHT REMAINS THE SAME REMAINS FIXED WHICH IS CAUSING AN ENORMOUS TAX BURDEN- IN REGARDS TO SMALL FAMILY GROWERS. IN THIS SITUATION DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH THE EXCISE TAX BECAUSE IT'S A PERCENTAGE OF THE SALES PRICE. SO CULTIVATION TAXES ARE CRUSHING SMALL FARMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE SMALL GROWERS HAVE TRIED TO COME INTO THE REGULATED MARKET THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT. AS SET UP IN PROP SIXTY FOUR WELL COMPETING AGAINST THE BLACK MARKET. THE BLACK MARKET ISN'T FOLLOWING THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY RULES AS ESTABLISH PER CALIFORNIA VOTERS. AND UNLIKE ANY OTHER AGRICULTURAL CROP IN CALIFORNIA CANNABIS IS EXTENSIVELY TAX AT THE FARM HE MATCHING IF WE HAD TO PAY THIS FOR TOMATOES OR A- HEAD OF LETTUCE OR CARROTS. THIS IS CREATING A DOWNWARD TREND OF CANNABIS FARMERS BECAUSE TEY SIMPLY CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE BLACK MARKET IN COMMERCIAL CANNABIS. THE TAX BURDEN IS GROWING DISPROPORTIONATELY. INVEST PRICE COLLAPSE AND IT'S SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF CANNABIS FARMERS OUT THERE WHO ARE SMALL FAMILY FARMERS. SB TEN SEP. EIGHT EXISTING WEIGHT BASE CAMP. FISHING TAX IN ROLE THE CANNABIST A STATE CANNABIS TAXES INTO A SINGLE PERCENTAGE BASE EXCISE TAX. SO THIS KEEPS IT ESSENTIALLY WHERE THE- SAID- AT THE SAME TAX RATE. SB TEN SEVENTY FOUR ALSO TEMPORARILY SUSPENDS THE CULTIVATION TAX. FULLY UNTIL JULY FIRST TO THE TWENTY. IN TOUCH FOR TWENTY SIX IF THE LEGISLATURE. MONEY AS PER OF THE BUDGET PROCESS THE TAX REDUCTION IS PART OF BUDGET CONVERSATIONS EVEN AS WE SPEAK IN ITS ONGOING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION I DON'T THINK I'M LETTING THE CAT OF THE BAG IS. AT THIS IS BEEN ONGOING FOR WEEKS NOW AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT A DEAL WILL BE REALIZED IN THE COMING FEW WEEKS. NOW I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE BILL WHICH I WILL CHARACTERIZE IS A BIT OF HOG WASH. OUT FIRST- THAT I'VE HEARD SOME SAY THAT IF THERE WILL BILL PASSES THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO CUT PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY CANNABIS TAXES. THIS IS NOT TRUE. SO IT IS ALWAYS BEEN OUR INTENTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS WERE NOT IMPACTED. AND TO MAKE IT SUPER CLEAR WE'VE AMENDED THE BILL TO MAKE SURE. THAT ANY REDUCTION IN TAXES CAN ONLY OCCUR IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES AS PART OF BUDGET CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT TO. BEGIN ADMINISTRATION RETURN GRATEFUL FOR. IS ENGAGING ON THE SUBJECT EVEN AS WE SPEAK. NOW IF NO FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATED. THE CANNABIS TAX INSULT CONSOLIDATION GOES INTO A SINGLE. STATE EXCISE TAX WHICH WOULD BE REVENUE NEUTRAL. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE CULTIVATION TAX WOULD GO TO ZERO. IN THE EXCISE TAX IS ADJUSTED TO BRING IN THIS EXACT SAME TAX REVENUE BUT IT TIME TO SAIL. AT THE RETAIL SIDE. WE WOULD NOT SEE A REDUCTION IN TAXES COMING IN CONSUMERS WOULD NOT BE PAYING MORE IN TAXES THEY IF WE DON'T SEE THE BACKFILL. SECOND WE'VE ALSO HEARD A CONCERN THAT THERE SHOULD BE IN L. L. A. O. STUDY IMPACTS. I FOCUS ON THE IMPACTS OF ANY TAX CHANGE. I WILL BE I AM BIASED. THERE HAVE BEEN STUDY AFTER DAM STUDY AFTER STUDY ON CANNABIS TAXES IN CANNABIS IN THE STATE OVER THE YEARS IN ON EVERY MAJOR CANNABIS POLICY. IN CANDIDLY WE GOT TO IMPLEMENT WITH THE VOTER SAID WE NEEDED EMPLOYMENT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LASTLY WE'VE HEARD THAT ANY TAX CHANGES SHOULD BE TEMPORARILY. AND WHILE THE BILL OUTLINES A TEMPORARY FRAMEWORK FOR REDUCING OVERALL TAX BURDEN I HAVE TO DISAGREE THAT WE WOULD ONLY TEMPORARY GET RID OF THE CULTIVATION TAX FRAMEWORK IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT STATES THAT ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING. A CULTIVATION TAXES AS WE SEE NOW OVER HALF OF ALL STATES IN THE UNITED STATES AMERICA EITHER RECREATIONAL OR MEDICINAL USE. THEY ARE NOT LOOKING AT A WEIGHT BASED CULTIVATION TAX BECAUSE IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK IN IT CRUSHES A SMALL FAMILY FARMERS. FINALLY HOW TO SAY THIS. SB TEN SEVENTY FOUR USES THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROPOSE REVISING CANNABIS TAXES TO A SINGLE PERCENTAGE BASE EXCISE TAX. IT SUPPORTED BY RURAL COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN NOT A PROP SIXTY FOUR REQUIRED US TO LITERALLY BUILD THIS PLANE IS WERE FLYING IT. AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE BRINGING THIS FORWARD GIVEN ENTER THANK YOU SO MUCH WE HAVE. WITH US TODAY WE HAVE EIGHT PIECE IS A SMALL FARMER FROM TRINITY COUNTY IN WITH SUPERVISOR REX BOHN FROM HUMBLE COUNTY TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT WE'VE HAD IN RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR IN IBM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THOSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF THE HEARING AND TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATION. THE CHAIR WILL INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. HE SAID I WILL BE PERMITTED IN EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME- AND WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY DO HERE IS TWO MINUTES EACH. AND ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE TWO IDENTIFIED. LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT IT AND SEVENTY FOUR ADD UP AND THEN FILTER MCGUIRE SAID HE'S BEEN A GREAT PARTNER WITH THE STUFF YOU'RE ALL THE WAY THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. I TALKED WHEN ASSEMBLY HEARING AFTER THE PROP ABOUT. THE APPROVAL AND- PROP FIFTY FOUR AND IT WAS IT WAS A OUT ASSEMBLY HEARING ON WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR COUNTIES. NOW WITH LEGALIZATION. WELL SIX YEARS LATER I BY A MILE. UNDER THE SMALL AND THEN DEPEND AGAIN FARMERS CURRENTLY FACES RESTIVE STATE FORCED OUT THE FLIGHT MARKET. THE FEAR OF PORTABLE LIGHTER MARKET IS THEY CAN GO IN THE BLACK. IT'S DUE IN LARGE PART A CLASS WHOLESALE MARKET PRICES FOR CANNABIS FLOWER COMPOUNDED BY LAST WEEK LAST WEEK FACEBOOK BASIC FACT. WHAT REPORT REMAINS THE SAME REGARDLESS OF MARKET CONDITIONS. BUT LIKE THE FEATHER- ALLUDED TO. THE CHALLENGES ARE PARTICULARLY HARD FOR OUTDOOR CANNABIS FARMERS WHO TYPICALLY HAVE LOWER YIELDS. AND SELL PRODUCTS FOR LOWER PRICES. WHAT MARKET CONDITIONS OF HIGHLIGHTED HIGHLIGHTED THE INEQUITIES OF STUFF THE BASIC FACT. MANY THE CULTIVATION TAX LIMITATIONS- JERICHO FAR BASED THAT. ON AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS A SINGLE WEIGHT FACT AND NOT ACCOUNT. FOR WIDELY- RIGHT VERY GREAT A FLOWER WHICH CAN VERY BASED ON CULTIVATION ABOUT THAT. BUT ALSO EVEN IN THE CANNABIS. DESPITE A SINGLE PLANT. MANY OF ALMOST PULLED THE- A LONG PART OF OUR BETTER 85% OUR- LIE. EXTEND THOUSANDS EVEN. OUR HOMESTEAD PARK ANIMALS DOES NOT THE BILL AFTER. IF THEIR LIVES. AND IN TWO THOUSAND. THE APPS AND COME OUT OF THE STORE IF WE WORK WITH THEM AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING TODAY. SB KILLED SEVENTY FOUR WOULD ESTABLISH A MORE SENSIBLE TAX STRUCTURE. FOR LIKE THIS CANNABIS THE BOOK PROVIDED THAT'S A LIFE BY FOR CRAP LIKE IF YOU FOR DESSERT. CHOSEN TO STEP FORWARD IN THE LEGAL MARKET AND REGULATED CANNABIS MARKET AND A FAIRFAX. WE MAKE A BETTER CALIFORNIA AND I THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME. I THANK THAT ARE REQUIRED RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WITNESS ADRIN KEYS. THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO BE THERE IN PERSON BUT MAJESTICALLY FINANCIAL REASONS ADMITTED THAT A POSSIBLE FORTY TODAY MY NAME IS ADRIAN KEYS I'M A LICENSED SMALL OUTDOOR CULTIVATOR IN TRINITY COUNTY BEFORE. I AM ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND SERVE AS A REGIONAL CHAIR TO THE ORIGINS COUNCIL WHICH REPRESENTS NEARLY NINE HUNDRED INDEPENDENT SMALL LICENSED CANNABIS BUSINESSES STATEWIDE. THE CULTIVATION TAX IS A BURDEN TOO GREAT TO BEAR FOR MANY OF CALIFORNIA SMALL CALL TO SLOWLY GET THE CULTIVATORS AND EXCESSIVE TAXATION IS DRIVING FORCE BEHIND. REGULATING SALES. PROPOSITION FOUR. THAT IT. THE TRANSITION EXISTING MEDICAL INDUSTRY INTO. PROVIDE REASONABLE ACCESS TO REGULARLY CANNABIS FOR CONSUMERS AND TO ALLEVIATE THE IMPACTS OF THE AN UNREGULATED MARKET I SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THIS HAPPENING IN FACT ALL AROUND ME WEISS'S CULTIVATORS RUN THEIR LAST LEGS WE ARE THE VERY PEOPLE REFER TO IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR AND ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. PRESENTLY A TREATY COUNTY ONLY ABOUT HALF OF PREVIOUS LICENSE SITE HAS SUBMITTED RETOOL FOR THE COUNTY. HISTORIC LEVEL OF ELITE FIFTEEN AREAS OF ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SMALL PRODUCERS WERE REDUCED TO A HANDFUL OF LICENSEES AND A THRIVING ON REGULATED MARKETS. IF NO ACTION TAKEN. FAILED TO THE REGULATED MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE LICENSE LEGACY CULTIVATORS WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE THEIR BUSINESSES AND THEIR HOMES. AND ILLICIT MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE. RESHAPE THE BENEFITS CANNABIS TAXES PROVIDED. DRUG PREVENTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS IN FACT MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS THE RECIPIENT OF THE CDFW WATERSHED ENHANCEMENT GRANT AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT. PLEASE SUPPORT THE PERMANENT ELIMINATION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX. AND OVERALL KILLER THIS TAX REDUCTION AND THE LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS TO BACK FILL TAX REVENUE LOSSES TO THESE BENEFICIAL AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS. THE CULT OF THE FLAT RATE CULTIVATION TAX STRUCTURES DOES NOT WORK FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. DROP IN THE VALUE OF A WHOLESALE POUND OF CANNABIS FROM ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH A HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS WITHOUT GOING TOWARDS THE CULTIVATION TAX. IS A RECIPE FOR FARMERS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO SMALL HOSTED FARMERS ALL OVER THE STATE RIGHT NOW. THE BEST WAY TO GENERATE TAX REVENUE IS TO INCREASE CONSUMER PARTICIPATION. AND PRESENTLY LESS THAN HALF THE CANNABIS CONSUMING CALIFORNIA'S PURCHASED IN THE REGULATED SYSTEM. LEAVING A FAST ON TOUCH POOL OF POTENTIAL TAX REVENUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTHFOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY APPRECIATE YOU CALLING IN- AND THIS WORKS- IT'S A WAY TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A DEMOCRACY EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE- YOU'RE WAY FAR.

AND THEN IMPOSING 25% AND STATE TAXES AND THEN WHATEVER LOCALS DECIDE TO DO SO THIRTY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. HAS MADE TEN OF US NOT JUST HARD TO ACCESS BUT HAS MADE IT VERY EXPENSIVE. TO PURCHASING LEGAL CANNABIS IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE- SO IF YOU- LOW INCOME- YOUR GOOD LUCK TRYING TO FIND LEGAL CANNABIS THAT YOU CAN AFFORD IT SO NO WONDER THE ILLICIT MARKET IS ABSOLUTELY THRIVING. IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE STRANGLING THE LEGAL MARKET- WITH TAXES WITH WITH WITH SOME OF THE REGULATION AND WITH THE- BROAD BANDS- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WAS STRANGLED IN THE LEGAL MARKET- AND WE NEED TO STOP DOING THAT. ZACKS RELIEF IS PART OF THAT AND I SAY THAT AS A PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT WHO- YOU KNOW BELIEVES THAT YOUR TAXES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FUNDING GOVERNMENT- BUT WE WENT TOO FAR HERE AND SO- THERE ARE VARIOUS BILLS ONE OF MINE WILL BE HEARD. LATER TODAY TO TRY TO PROVIDE- TAX RELIEF TO THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT WE STILL HAVE. WE TAXES ARE IMPORTANT IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY BUT WE ARE WITH OVER DONE IT WITH OVERSIGHT AND WE NEED TO TAKE. A DEEP BREATH AND RESTRUCTURE HOW WE TAX CANNABIS- AND SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I ASSUMING THIS IS ALL GOING TO RESULT IN THE BUDGET. WITH ALL OF OUR VARIOUS- BILLS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THAT CONVERSATION- AND I'LL MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD I WILL SAY THAT I% AM SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO BUT STILL TRYING TO THE CULTIVATION. TAX I WILL BE VERY CLEAR I DO NOT SUPPORT INCREASING THE EXCISE TAX- BUT I WAS IN THE AUTHORS DOING THAT. TRY TO MAKE IT REVENUE NEUTRAL AND NOT OR SOME DIFFERENT TEMPTATIONS. PROP SIXTY FOUR AND WE CAN AND CAN'T DO. ABOUT ON THE CRIED DO NOT SUPPORT RAISING EXCISE TAX OF MEL B. HARMFUL. TO RETAILERS IN PLACES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO- AND YOU COULD END UP. REALLY MAKING A PROBLEM IN SOME WAYS WORSE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO REDUCE THE COST OF RETAIL CANNABIS OF THE STOP GOING WAS A MARKET. SO THIS IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY- BUT I DID WANT TO JUST PUT ON THE RECORD THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO INCREASING. THE EXCISE TAX. I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE- MOTIONS BEEN MADE A SENATOR WIENER CENTER RAZA THANK YOU. I KNOW THE AUTHOR WORKS REALLY REALLY HARD AT WHAT YOU DECIDE TO JUMP INTO SO I REALLY APPRECIATE NOT BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT DEBATE AND THOSE KINDS OF- BILLS AND LEGISLATION I COUNT ON YOU DEPEND ON YOU A LOT YOU HAVE ENORMOUS CREDIBILITY- JUST SOMETHING THAT- SENATOR WINNER JUST MENTIONED WHICH I WAS GOING TO ASK. IS WHAT DO ALL THESE BILLS ARE THEIR DIFFERENCES THAT NEED STILL NEED TO BE RESOLVED I KNOW THERE'S ONE ABOUT- REDUCING THE EXCISE TAX FROM FIFTEEN TO FIVE PERCENT. HOW DO THEY ALL FIT INTO JUST. YOU KNOW IN YOUR OPINION WE JUST APPROVED THE MALL AND THEN LEAVE IT UP TO SOME YOU KNOW SOME OF THE GROUP TO ADDRESS IT- IS A LEGAL ISSUE COULD YOU JUST DESCRIBE THAT MORE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF BILLS TODAY ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH WHEN SENATOR AND- IF IT'S THROUGH THE CHAIR- YEAH SO. LOOK I THINK BIG PICTURE ON A LOT OF THE ISSUES IN REGARDS TO REVENUE IN TAXES IT'S GOING TO BE RESOLVED IN THE BUDGET. SO THERE HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON GOING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN. THE AUTHORS OF THESE INDIVIDUAL BILLS. ESPECIALLY FOCUS ON REVENUE IN TAXES. IN THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS GOING TO NEED TO BE RESOLVED WITH IN THE BUDGET. AND THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD BELONG. ON THE BIG PICTURE OF TAXES AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY OWN EDITORIAL I THINK EVENTUALLY WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK WHEN I SAY WE EAT THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO. GO BACK TO THE VOTERS SO WHAT WE SEEN IN EARLY ADOPTER STATES ACROSS THIS NATION WHO HAVE LEGALIZED RECREATIONAL CANNABIS I'M GONNA USE OF THE TERM THAT CENTER WIENER. I SAID IS THEY OVERSHOT ON TAXES ON TO HIGH SO WE HAVE. SOME IN THE OPPOSITION YOU HEARD TODAY SAID THAT THERE IS- THE CHALLENGES DON'T EXIST I WELCOME. THE OPPOSITION TO COME TO THE NORTH COAST. THE VAST MAJORITY ARE SMALL FAMILY FARMERS THEY'VE LITERALLY BEEN FARMING CANNABIS FOR DECADES LONGER THAN I'VE BEEN ALIVE. AND THEY ARE DYING ON THE VINE. WE HAVE A MAJOR ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE CULTIVATION BUT ULTIMATELY AMOUNT OF CENTER WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO- WORK THIS OUT IN THE BUDGET. AND THEN I THINK A BIG PICTURE WE MAY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS HERE AS THE INDUSTRY MATURES. THAT'S WHY I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE A CAUGHT MY OWN EDITORIAL LONG TERM. SENATOR NELSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M A FAN OF THE AUTHOR. IN THE AREA THAT HE REPRESENTS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE I REPRESENTED A GOOD PORTION OF IT MYSELF. I'VE NOT BEEN A FAN OF CANNABIS IN FACT IN THE EIGHTIES- AUTHORED THE CAMP PROGRAM TO STAMP OUT MARIJUANA. THE TRAIN'S LEFT THE STATION. WHAT HAS NOT LEFT THE STATION IS THAT BLACK MARKET THAT INSIDIOUS BLACK MARKET. VERY DANGEROUS BLACK MARKET. AND I DO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEGITIMATELY TRY. STRIVING. TO GROW THE MARKET MARIJUANA. THEN I STIPULATE THE MERIT OF. THE USE OF MARIJUANA FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES. SO WITH KIND OF SETTING ASIDE MY HISTORIC IN THE BIASES I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD FOR THE TIMES THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING NOW I THANK THE AUTHOR AND I WILL SUPPORTERS GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I AM I WANT AGREE WITH MY WITH MY COLLEAGUES I THINK THIS IS- TO TAX. CULTIVATION DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE- BUT- WE ARE BUILDING THIS AIRPLANE AS AS WE FLY IT AND THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY AND I DO THINK WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS AND ASK THEM FOR PERMISSION TO CHANGE SOME OF THE- ELEMENTS OF. THE ORIGINAL- OF THE ORIGINAL- PROPOSITION I IT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH PROPOSITIONS IS THAT ONCE YOU GET IT. ONCE YOU PUT IT DOWN ON PAPER. IF THE REALITY CHANGES- AND SOCIETY CHANGES YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS AND YOU'RE SO YOU'RE STUCK WITH THE DETAILS AND SO. WE'RE LEARNING AND I THINK- BECOMING A LITTLE BIT WISER AND DOES THIS MAKE SENSE AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET TAKEN CARE OF IN THE BUDGET AND- YOUR FOCUS ON. MOVING AWAY FROM TAXATION AT THE POINT OF- AT THE END OF A CULTIVATION SEASON MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME SO MANY SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING MORE WORK ON IT CLEARLY MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WIENER DO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.

KNOWN AND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATORS CAPITO I GOT THE AUTO HI NIELSEN HI NIELSEN HI DURAZO. TERRAZZO HI HERTZBERG AYE HERTZBERG BY WIENER. WIENER HI THANK YOU SO MUCH RECUPERO THE BILL IS OUT FIVE ZERO. ONE NO ANDREA DID YOU SO- WE DO. CENTER GROVE. WELCOME EUROPE ON S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM I AM HONORED TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTSWE KNOW ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW FROM THE HIGH COST OF GASOLINE COLLEAGUES IN THE INFLATION RATE IS THE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN IN FORTY YEARS AS OF APRIL TWENTY NINTH YEAH AUSTIN GASOLINE IN CALIFORNIA HAS JUMPED TO FIVE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY CENTS A GALLON ON AVERAGE. COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS PER GALLON THAT'S A DIFFERENCE OF A DOLLAR FIFTY FIVE PER GALLON FOR WATER CONSTITUENTS FOR POINT WHERE PAIN JUST LAST YEAR. WELL THIS IS NOTHING NEW FOR CALIFORNIANS TO BE THE HIGHEST GAS TAX PRICES IN THE NATION CAN IT STILL. PANDEMIC SIMPLY CANNOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE TAX THE GAS TAX IMPOSED BY CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT. EVEN THOUGH MANY ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE MONTH ON JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR JUST A FEW MONTHS FROM NOW THE GAS TAX WILL GO EVEN HIGHER- IT'LL BE AN INCREASE ON THE GASOLINE EXCISE TAX OF FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL TAX INCREASE ON GAS FOR FIVE AT FIVE POINT 6% WELL JUST BECAUSE A MORE DETRIMENTAL TO FAMILIES NEEDING TO PUT FUEL IN THEIR CAR TO GO TO WORK. LIKE THAT. CURRENTLY REQUIRES. DEPARTMENT AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO ANNUALLY ADJUST THIS TAX ON GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. TO THE GVERNOR'S CREDIT THIS PAST YEAR HE IDENTIFIED THIS INFLAMMATORY- THIS INFLATIONARY PRESSURE AS A PROBLEM IN THE JANUARY BUDGET IN HE PROPOSED A ONE YEAR SUSPENSION OF THE GAS INCREASE. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEADLINE TO STOP THE ADJUSTMENT JUST PASSED THIS SEND. OUR CONSTITUENTS TO BE WONDERING WHY THIS LEGISLATURE WOULD ALLOW TAXES TO BE INCREASED ON GASOLINE WHEN THE PRICE PER GALLON RECENTLY RE REACH HISTORICAL HEIGHTS. WE NOW KNOW THAT THIS YEAR'S INCREASE WHAT IF THIS YEAR'S INCREASE LOOKS LIKE BUT NEXT YEAR IT COULD BE EVEN WORSE IN MARCH IN THE INFLATION RATE WAS EIGHT POINT FIVE PER CENT CALLS THAT'S THE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. IF PLACE IN STAYS HIGH OUR CONSTITUENTS WILL FACE ANOTHER INFLATIONARY INCREASE NEXT YEAR I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SUSPEND THE DEBT GAS TAX INCREASE BUT I DO BELIEVE THE PUBLIC WANTS US TO TAKE A STEP FURTHER. AND GIVE THEM THE REAL HELP THAT THEY NEED AT THE GAS PUMP. SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX WILL STOP THE GAS TAX AND- BY PERMANENTLY ENDING THE ANNUAL INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS IN BOTH THE GASOLINE TAX IN THE DIESEL FUEL EXCISE TAX. THIS IS THE ONLY LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO OFFER A PERMANENT HELP FOR THE TAXPAYERS AT THE PUMP. AND WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT. SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX IS MUCH NEEDED TO STEP TO BE IN A MUCH NEED TO STEP TO PROTECT FAMILIES FROM THE GROWING PRICE OF GASOLINE AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ON THE PHONE IS THE MAYOR OF TAFT A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. AND HE'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE INDIVIDUAL THAT REALLY CARES ABOUT PEOPLE OR SOME OF THE POOREST PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. DAVE NOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HE ADDED M. THE MAYOR DO- IT NOR- ARE YOU ON THE PHONE. YES MADAM CHAIRMAN OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ALTHOUGH THE IDEA BEHIND AUTOMATICALLY INCREASING EXCISE TAX ON GAS AND DIESEL BASED ON THE CPI IS LIKE A GOOD IDEA. IN REALITY IT SERVES THE INCREASE THE TAX BURDEN ON CALIFORNIANS AUTOMATICALLY EVERY TIME THEY CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. BUT SOME FOURTEEN MILLION ONE IS 36% OF THE POPULATION CURRENTLY LIVING NEAR OR BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL AND CURRENTLY PAYING YOUR THE HIGHEST RATES FOR BOTH TRANSPORTATION ENERGY GAS AND DIESEL AS WELL AS IN HOME ENERGY. ANY ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDEN SERVES TO DESTROY THE ABILITY AT THE SAME FAMILIES WORKING FAMILIES. PAGE NEEDS A CALL OF LIFE. BUT IT THE CURRENT FUNDED BY MANY OF THE SAME WORKING TAXPAYING FAMILIES THAT PROVIDE FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIALLY FORTUNATE BY NEW PLUG ANY NEEDS. YOU TO THE EVER WIDENING HEALTH GAPS THAT EXIST IN THE STATE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF THE TESLA BUYER WITH A HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. MORE THAN TWICE THE NATIONAL MEDIAN INCOME PLUGIN EDIE OWNERS PAY ABSOLUTELY NO STATE OR FEDERAL HIGHWAY TAXES OR SALES TAXES BECAUSE THEY DON'T PURCHASE GAS OR DIESEL. WITH THE ANNUAL CPI INCREASE ON FUEL AND THE VALUE OF THE TAX HOLIDAY FOR THE FORTUNATE FEW. INCREASES WELL THE CRUSHING COST OF HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE AND FUNDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AGAIN LANDS ON THE BACK TO THE UNDERSERVED THE LOWER INCOME POPULATION. THIS SOCIAL INJUSTICE THE BY PRODUCT OF MULTIPLE STATE POLICY THAT AGAIN ABANDON THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS OF A GROWING SECTION OF OUR POPULATION. CAN BE PARTIALLY DRESSED BY THE PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL ELEVEN FIFTY SIX THEREFORE. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

OUR INDUSTRY FOUGHT. INCLUDE THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE X. TAX RATES WITHIN AS FEW ONE SO THAT STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE PACE OF IMPROVEMENTS. TO OUR THEN BELEAGUERED SYSTEM THAT'S COMING AROUND AT THIS POINT TIME. THE TAX IT JUST MEANT. IS TARGETING OUR BACKLOG.

WITH NEARLY SIXTEEN BILLION TO HAVING FLOWN INTO OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM SINCE SB ONE PASSED EVEN WITH THE OBVIOUS SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE SEEN UNDER WAY TODAY WE KNOW THAT WE WILL BE SEEING A GROWING GAP IN RESOURCES TO ME ROADWAY AND LOCAL REPAIR NEEDS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THEN EARLIER. YOU KNOW I CONSIDER IT. RATHER SADLY USING. THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THIS ISN'T A SAVE ALL BY ANY MEANS. AND THESE GAS PRICES ARE STRICTLY AN ABSOLUTELY DRIVEN BY FEDERAL POLICY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. WHICH HAVE INHIBITED SUPPLY WE WERE. NOT DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN NATIONS ON OUR ENEMIES. FOR FUEL TWO YEARS AGO AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS. NOW WE ARE AT THE MOST PERILOUS TIME FOCUS THEIR ENERGIES ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL POLICIES. NOW AS WELL REGULATORY POLICIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU CANNOT CONSERVE YOUR WAY INTO THE FUTURE. FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN THEN EITHER ENERGY. OR IN TERMS OF WATER WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT. THIS BILL. IS A MINOR HELPING HAND THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS- DRIVE BY THOSE GAS STATIONS LOOK AT THOSE PUMP PRICES. AND WONDER HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET TO WORK THE PICKED THE KIDS UP AT SCHOOL. IT'S SCARY TO SEE OUR COUNTRY COME TO THIS I WILL MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU THERE IS A MOTION BY SENATOR NELSON THIRD WIENER I THANK YOU CENTER GUERRERO- I'M- NOT SURPRISINGLY I THINK THE AUTHOR I'M EXTREMELY OPPOSED- TO THE SPELL OF HIS BILL WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DISASTROUS FOR CALIFORNIA'S- EFFORT TO- ACTUALLYTAKE CARE OF OUR ROADS- TO REBUILD OUR DILAPIDATED STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM TO SUPPORT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THIS IS A VERY EXTREME. MEASURE THIS ISN'T EVEN MORE I MEAN I DON'T LIKE TO THINK IT WAS PROPOSING WHICH IS A ONE YEAR- THE LADY OF THE- OF THE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT THIS IS A PERMANENT ELIMINATION OF- THE INFLATIONARY- COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT- FOR THE GAS TAX AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S A HALF A BILLION THIS YEAR. CLOSE TO A DEAL NEXT AND NOT WILL COMPOUND. OVER TIMES OVER THE NEXT DECADE DISABILITY BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN RESURFACING ROADS IN FIXING STATE HIGHWAYS AND IN SHORING UP OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MEMBERS WE'RE TALKING OVER TIME TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. JUST SUCKED OUT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS STATE AND THAT MEANS ROADS WILL BE BUMPIER MORE. OUR CARS WILL BE DAMAGED BY KREDI ROADS- WE WILL HAVE MORE OF THOSE HORRIBLE POTHOLES ON THE STATE'S HIGHWAYS THAT CALTRANS WON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AFFECTS. AND PEOPLE WHO RELY ON BUS SERVICE OR SERVICE OR TRAIN SERVICE TO GET TO WORK OR WHEREVER THEY'RE GOING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT LONGER I HAVE BY. WORSE EXPERIENCES- AND SO THIS IS NOT JUST SOME MINOR TEN. PIECE FOR WHILE WE HIKED GAS PRICES THAT SEEM TO BE. USING A MAYBE COMING DOWN THIS IS NOT TEMPORARILY. THIS IS A PERMANENT WRECKING BALL TO OUR ABILITY AS A STATE TO. WE ARE. DR SYSTEM ARMS THIS IS A VERY SEVERE VERY HARMFUL WHY ARE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND SUCH ABOUT **** BAD SHAPE PEOPLE GET VERY FRUSTRATED AND LIKE- WE WILL PASS THE GAS TAX INCREASE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WE STILL HAVE ROADS THAT ARE IN BAD SHAPE AND HIGHWAYS SO YOU MUST NOT BE DOING ANYTHING THE REASON IS BECAUSE FOR THIRTY YEARS THIS STATE WAS DENIED BUDGETS GET PASSED TAX AND- THIRTY YEARS AT THE CLUB. IN REAL VALUE ABOUT 50% DIDN'T GO UP BY INFLATION FROM THE EARLY NINETIES UNTIL YOU KNOW ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO- AND SO WE REALLY ALLOWED ARE TRANSFERRED TO HAVE A STRUCTURE TO DETERIORATE AND WE ARE DIGGING OUT OF DEEP OR NOT YOU CAN'T DO IT TO YOUR IT TAKES TIME THE LAST THING WE SHOULD BE DOING IS SHOOTING OURSELVES BUT BY SUCKING ALTERNATELY TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF OURS. PREDATION BOND- I ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY A MA'AM OF THE TO DOWN THERE'S A OF MESS. GOING NOT NOT JUST IN THIS HEARING BUT FROM YOU KNOW I'M NOT JUST FROM REPUBLICANS. ODDS THE TRAGICALLY FROM SOME DEMOCRATS TO- DIED- IF WE TRUST THE SPENDER LOWER THE GAS TAX YOUR GAS PRICES ARE GONNA GO DOWN I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. GAS GAS TAXES ARE NOT BEING DRIVEN ACHIEVEMENT GAS PRICES ARE NOT BEING DRIVEN BY WEATHER YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS OR THAT GAS TAX. IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE OIL COMPANIES. I'M TO BLAME THE BITE IN ADMINISTRATION FOR YOU KNOW SOME OF CONSTRAINING OIL SUPPLY AND WE HAVE SO MANY. FEDERAL GAS LEASE OR WILL WE SAYS IT WILL COMPANIES AREN'T EVEN USING Y. FOR THEIR OWN BOTTOM LINE BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN OVER SUPPLIED DATA WILL COMPANIES BENEFIT. FROM HAVING HIGH GAS PRICES AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO TRY TO CONSTRAIN THAT- AND TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY MORE THE GUY AT THE PUMP. THAT IS IT WILL COMPANIES CATERING TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA WILL COMPANIES DON'T CARE. IF SOMEONE WHO IS LOW INCOME HAS TO PAY MORE AT THE PUMP TO GET THE WORK BUILT COMPANIES COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THAT. THEY CARE ABOUT PLEASING THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE KEEPING THE PRICES HIGH. AND WE COULD ELIMINATE THE STATE GAS TAX TOMORROW AND THAT IS NO GUARANTEE BUT GAS PRICES WILL GO DOWN AT ALL. AND THE DEBT WILL COMPANIES ARE JUST AS LIKELY TO STOP POCKET THE DIFFERENCE. AND WE WILL BE SUBSIDIZING THE OIL COMPANIES SO THIS IS I THINK A MISREPRESENTATION OF THE PUBLIC TO SAY THAT DO THAT PASSING THIS BILL OR LOWERING GAS TAXES. IS GOING TO LOWER YOUR GAS PRICES PROBABLY WON'T. BUT WHAT IT WILL DO IS MAKE YOU HAVE TO GO TO MY- MORE. WHEN YOUR CAR GETS DAMAGED BECAUSE WERE SUCKING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF ROAD RESURFACING HIGHWAY REPAIRS. AND BUS AND TRAIN SERVICE SO I AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I'M VOTING NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YOUR EYES ON. IT WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE COMMENTS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE COULD. SENATOR EYES THANK YOU- I DO- NUMBER A COMMON THE AUTHOR FOR RAISING THE ISSUE OF WHAT. IT IS THAT POOR AND MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH WITH GAS PRICES- I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE THAT THE GAS PRICES ARE BEING INCREASED AS MUCH AS THEY ARE. MY PROBLEM WITH WITH THE BILL IS THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THOSE PRICES WILL GO DOWN. IF WE ELIMINATE THE AND INFLATION IN THE GAS IN THE GAS TAX THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM AND I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT EVERYTHING THE CENTER WIENER SAID BUT- IF THERE WAS RELIEF AND IT WAS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH. I WOULD COUNTERBALANCE THAT WITH OKAY WE WILL BE LOSING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE FIRST YEAR ALMOST BILLION DOLLARS THE NEXT YEAR- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF LOSS OF JOBS. LOST TO BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON THESE ON ON THIS- INVESTMENT. THROUGH IN BALANCING THE TWO I DON'T SEE ONE THAT THE- REGULAR WORKING PEOPLE. NEED TO GAS UP THEIR CARS AND TRUCKS TO GET TO WORK I DON'T SEE HOW THEY GET THE RELIEF SO THAT'S THE PRIMARY REASON. THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. VERY GOOD- TO SAY THAT THAT- THAT MANY OF THE THINGS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID- RIGHT IBM. ARE TRUE ABILITY I GUESS I SEE THIS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND- TO THE EXTENT THAT- THE GOVERNOR'S TALKED ABOUT. GAS TAX RELIEF THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT GAS TAX RELIEF I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION CONTINUE UNTIL WE FINALLY ADOPT BUDGETS AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF RELIEF FOR GONNA. GIVE TO THE TAXPAYERS- BUT ALSO I THINK THERE THERE ARE ALWAYS SEE ISSUES POLICY POSITIONS THAT WE TAKE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THAT THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TAP THAT THE TAX BEING THERE THE TAX NOT BEING THERE WHEN WE START- FOCUSING ON- ELECTRIC VEHICLES WERE IGNORING THE FACT THAT THEY USE THE ROAD THE CLOG THE HIGHWAYS BUT THEY DON'T PAY INTO A SYSTEM- AND WHEN WE START LOOKING AT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WHICH IS- PENALTY ON COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THING HOUSING- AND THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD HOUSING FOR THEIR WORKFORCE BUT ACTUALLY ARE BUILDING HOUSING FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S WORKFORCE WHO'S TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES WE DON'T RECOGNIZE IT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRAVELING THOSE REALLY LONG DISTANCES WHAT BETTER ROADS AND THEY WANT WIDER ROADS AND BIGGER ROADS AND WE'VE MADE THE COMMITMENT IN CALIFORNIA NOT TO WIDEN OUR FREEWAYS SYSTEM ON THE SO. ON THE SOME REALLY. SYSTEM OF- OF DOING THINGS WITH ONE HAND AND NOT DOING IT WITH THE OTHER AND I THINK THIS THIS WHOLE ISSUE I HAVE TO AGREE THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT REDUCING THE TAX. IS GOING TO BENEFIT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT BUT THERE'S A DISCUSSION GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S A BUDGET GOING ON THAT TO BEING CREATED AND- WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS AS PART OF A DISCUSSION BUDGET DISCUSSION THAT'LL BE- THEY'LL BE CONCLUDED IN A MONTH- WELL I'LL BE VOTING ON A BUDGET. AND HOW WE HOW WE HELP. OUR CITIZENS THAT ARE A RESIDENTS THAT ARE REALLY STRUGGLING IS IT'S GOT TO BE PART OF THAT BUDGET AND- AND I KNOW THAT- THAT ALL PARTIES AT THE TABLE WILL HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND SO I'M- WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY UNDERSTANDING THAT YET- PROBABLY WON'T GET THE VOTES. THAT IT NEEDS DOWN THE ROAD BUT- BUT I DO THINK THAT- I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING ON THIS AND- AND- AND I THINK THAT THAT LOOKING AFTER THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE LEAST THE LEAST. ABLE TO PAY THE HIGH PRICES IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE STATE ITSELF I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT SO THERE IS A MOTION BY SENATOR NELSON THE MOTION IS. TO PASS BUT FIRST BE RIVER RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS- YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS BILL- TO MOVE FORWARD I WOULD APPRECIATE IT I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOME JUST GONNA RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF. COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TO TRY TO CORRECT THE RECORD SO OBVIOUSLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES IS TAKING THEIR CUES FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. AND I WANT YOU TO BE REASSURED THAT OPEC SETS THE OIL PRICE RIGHT TEXAS AT SOME RANDOM OIL COMPANY IN KERN COUNTY OR ANYWHERE ELSE DOESN'T JUST RANDOMLY GO ON MEDICAL CHARGE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY SO OPEC ON A WORLD VIEW SETS THE OIL PRICES AND THEN THAT'S FILTERED DOWN THE UNITED STATES- IN EVERYWHERE THAT USES OIL. THE SECOND THING IS THAT OIL COMPANIES SELL TO REFINERIES THAT REFINE OIL THE CELL GET. THAT GASOLINE IS RETAILER LIKE A VALERO OR A CHEVRON GAS STATION MUCH LIKE WE'RE EITHER ANY OF PERSON ON THE DIESS WOULD GET THEIR GAS IS THAT GAS RETAILER IS NOT REQUIRED TO PAY THE ADDITIONAL TAX TO THE CITY CALIFORNIA EVERY GALLON OF GAS THAT THEY SELL. THE PRICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY DROP FOR EVERY GALLON OF GAS IT'S KIND OF LIKE AS AN EMPLOYER EVERY QUARTER W HAVE TO FILL OUT A D. E. SIX WE TAKE TAXES OUT OF AN EMPLOYEE'S CHECK. WE BALANCE THAT WITH R. D. E. SIX WE MATCH ON SOME OF THOSE TAXES AN EMPLOYER TAX MATCHING THE RECENT A FORM. YEAH THE STATE. IS IT PLAYER I WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE- OUT OF MY EMPLOYEES. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE TAXES OUT OF THE EMPLOYEES CHECKS. BECAUSE WHEN I SET MY FOR MEN TO THE STATE THAT THEY VERIFY IN BALANCE. THEY WOULD SHOW THAT I JUST PAID MY PORTION AND NOT THE EMPLOYEES PORTION. SO I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE- KIND OF. I WE HAVE READ THE BILL NOPE. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. AND I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THE OTHER POSITION THAT YOU MADE YOU ALSO SAID THAT THIS IS CATASTROPHIC AND IT WOULD ELIMINATE ROAD CONSTRUCTION DOLLARS. THE OPPOSITION'S OWN TESTIMONY SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS HAS FLOWED INTO THIS ACCOUNT. THIS BILL BEFORE YOU IS ONLY THE INFLATIONARY INCREASE THAT IS AUTOMATIC EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP THAT SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. THAT ALREADY EXISTS FROM FLOWING INTO THE ACCOUNT. THAT MANY STILL GOING TO BE THERE FOR ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S NOT GOING TO STOP THIS IS THE FIVE POINT 6% INCREASE STARTING JULY FIRST THAT WILL INCREASE THE COST OF GAS. FOR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES INNER CITY LOS ANGELES THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT DRIVE MILES AND MILES AND MILES JUST TO GET THE FEEL TO PICK THE FRUIT THAT WE EAT. AND THEY ARE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT INCREASE. THIS YEAR HI I'M GOOD LET'S JUST BE HONEST EVERYONE OF US WILL PAY THIS GAS TAX INCREASE. IT WILL GRIPE AND COMPLAIN ABOUT IT YOU KNOW I POSTED A PICTURE THE OTHER DAY I DRIVE A FORD EDGE IN MY GAS WAS A HUNDRED SIX DOLLARS TO FILL UP A FORD EDGE. I HAD A AND SIX DOLLARS I'M A GREAT ABOUT IT. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN EVEN IN LOS ANGELES IN THE INNER CITIES IN PROBABLY IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND DATA THAT CAN'T TO PAY THAT HUNDRED SIX DOLLARS TO FILL UP THEIR GAS TAX. THIS IS AN IMMEDIATE RELIEF AGAIN WE DON'T SET THE OIL PRICES. OPEC DOES AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE TAX THE RETAILER THE CHEVRON GAS STATION THE MINI MARKET THE SEVEN ELEVEN. THAT SELLS GAS WILL NOT CHARGE THAT GAS AT THE PUMP IT'S NOT GONNA BE RETAINED BY WHAT YOU CALL THESE EVIL OIL COMPANIES. THAT ARE TAKING THIS MANY AND POCKETING IT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. THEY REFINED OIL AND REFINERIES LIKE I SAID IT GOES TO THE RETAILER THE RETAILER SELLS THE GAS AND DOESN'T APPLY THE TAX. TO THE GAS PER GALLON. THE OTHER THING IS MY COLLEAGUE. IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE DONE THIS TO ME AND I KNOW THIS BILL DACA PASTIMES GONNA SAY IT. YOU TURN EVERYTHING POLITICAL. EVERYTHING I'D A BILL THE OTHER DAY. THAT WAS ABOUT STOPPING HUMAN TRAFFICKING PERPETRATORS. FROM AND- TO GO TO JAIL FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME DID THEY SELL. LGBT KIDS TRANSGENDER KIDS THEY BRUTALIZE WOMEN ANY PRODUCT RHONDA SANDERSON SOMETHING GOING ON THE FLORIDA. CAPITOL THERE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RUN TO AND DOES IN THIS BILL HERE HAS NOTHING TO DO. WITH ANYTHING GOING ON IN WASHINGTON DC- OIL COMPANIES THIS BILL IS BEING. BROUGHT TO YOU GUYS TO GIVE IMMEDIATE. RELIEF MEDIA RELEASE DOES. TO SEE. THE GAME TAX HE- IT WAS RELIEVED. AT THE GAS PUMP WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT INCREASE IT WAS SUSPENDED FOR ONE YEAR SO THE INCREASE IS NOT THERE. DID THE OPPOSITION STILL GET THEIR SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS MORE THAN WE'VE EVER SPENT. IN THE HISTORY PROBABLY OF CALIFORNIA. ABSOLUTELY THIS BILL JUST IT GETS THE GAP. THEY'RE STILL GONNA GET THE FIFTY ONE CENTS A GALLON. FOR THE GAS TAX SO THAT THEY CAN DO ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH AGAIN IS SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. THEY'RE JUST NOT GONNA GET THE FIVE POINT 6% EXCISE INCREASE STARTING JULY FIRST. WHICH WILL GIVE US. A RELIEF AT THE GAS PUMP I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BUT- REMATCH WE DO HAVE A MOTION. MOTION IS DUE PASSING BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATORS CAPITO HI SANTIAGO HI NIELSEN HI NIELSEN HI DURAZO. THE ROSEAU NO HERTZBERG. WIENER WIENER NOW. TO THE MAKING MEDICARE'S NOT PASS. WOULD YOU. IF THERE IF THERE IS NO OBJECTION- WE CAN GRAB RECONSIDERATION THANK YOU FOR GOOD US SENATOR YOU HAVE SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR I DO HOPEFULLY I'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH THIS BILL I AM SO GOOD MORNING MANAGER MEMBERS I HAVE S. B. LOOK FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH IS A HOMELESS FOSTER YOUTH AND FOSTER YOUTH EMPLOYER TAX CREDIT- I. E. I APPRECIATE TO LIVE BY SAYING THAT I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBER TODAY AND I APPRECIATE COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE BILL BUT I DO NEED TO MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION. A LOT OF OUR FOSTER YOU ARE HOMELESS THEY ARE- THE BILL FIRST INCLUDED HOMELESS AND FOSTER YOUTH BUT A LOT OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH ARE HOMELESS THERE THE SILVER SURFER KIDS THAT STAY ON OUR NEIGHBORS COUCHES ARE ON OUR COUCHES THE E. R. YOU KNOW THEY SPEND SOME NIGHTS WITH SOME FRIENDS AND SOME LIKE TO THE OTHERS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF AN EMPLOYER IS ABLE. F. YOU. R. S. B. CONSIDERED A FOSTER YOUTH BE THE HOME AT IF THAT MAKES SENSE LIKE I DON'T I WANT LET ME EXPLAIN IT BETTER I GUESS BECAUSE THE AMENDMENTS WERE UNCLEAR AND SO MY CLARIFICATION IS IF AN EMPLOYER HIRES A HOMELESS FOSTER YOUTH WILL THEY STILL GET THE TAX CREDIT BECAUSE THERE ARE FOSTERING BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE HOMELESS FOSTER YOU SINCE WE'RE ELIMINATING THE WHOLE. WELL THAT THE REASON FOR ELIMINATING IT WAS THAT IT ALREADY IS IN STATUTE AND SO THE IDEAS THEY CAN PICK WHATEVER CREDIT IT IS THAT- MEETS THEIR NEEDS GREAT OKAY I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE. OKAY SO LET ME START BY SAYING I'M ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS I THINK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY STAFF. SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL ALLOW PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS TO OBTAIN A TAX CREDIT MODELED AFTER THE CURRENT FEDERAL WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT TO PROMOTE HIRING. OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S A FOSTER YOUTH OR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. THE MAXIMUM CREDIT ALLOWED PER YEAR PER EMPLOYEE IS TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS NOT PER YEAR. TOTAL TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO OBTAIN VARIOUS TAX CREDITS FROM HIRING SELECT QUALIFIED FULL TIME EMPLOYEES INCLUDING VETERANS. DISABLED PERSONS LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT RECIPIENT. SECOND CANCERS AMONG THESE- WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS TAX CREDIT OR FOSTER YOUTH WHO FACE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE ODDS. AND ARE OFTEN AMONG THE MOST SEVERELY IMPACTED BY EVERY INCREASE EVER INCREASING COST OF THE BASIC FOOD AND HOUSING. CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE OFTEN STRUGGLE WHEN THEIR LIFE- WHEN LIKE CRISIS IS HAPPEN TO THEM THEY HAVE DRAMATIC LOST NEGLECT ABUSE. NGUYEN M. D. X. OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THEY MAY EVEN LIKE NECESSARY NETWORKS OR RESOURCES LEAVING THEM WITH LITTLE SUPPORT IN THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THEIR OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH AND OUTLOOK ON LIFE. IT'S CLEAR STUDENT EMPLOYMENT LEADS TO GREATER SELF SUFFICIENCY AND DISCIPLINE IT REDUCES THE TIME THAT YOU SPEND. I'M ON THE STREETS IT TEACHES THEM HE JOB SKILLS AND SOCIAL SKILLS AND PROVIDES INCOME STABILITY NECESSARY TO FIND IN MAINTAINING HOUSING. AND I'VE OFTEN SAID AS A JOB CREATOR IN THIS STATE FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT. AND SOLUTION TO POVERTY IS A JOB. TOGETHER THESE FACTORS REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT FOSTER YOUTH WILL BECOME STUCK IN A CYCLE OF POVERTY- HOMELESSNESS AND DEPENDENCY ON PUBLIC BENEFITS AND SERVICES. SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR TAKES A PER IN IF APPROACH INVESTS. IN YOU SUPPORTING THEM WITH GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT AND OFFERING THEM A BETTER CHANCE AT A SOLID START IN LIFE IT ALSO SUPPORTS THE BUSINESSES. THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE NOT A RISK BUT A CHANCE ON SOMEBODY THAT POSSIBLY- MAYBE A HIGHER RISK OF EMPLOYMENT AND I DON'T MEAN THAT NEGATIVELY I'M JUST SAYING THAT. WHEN PEOPLE COME TO AND GET EMPLOYED AND THE EMPLOYER GOES WILL WHERE DO YOU LIVE THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED YOUR ADDRESS THEY WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO WORK SO WE COUNSEL PEOPLE TO COME FROM THE HOMELESS CENTER. WE TELLING COUNTY. I LIVE DOWNTOWN. IT'S NOT THAT THE EMPLOYER ISN'T SO MUCH WORRIED ABOUT BUT WHEN YOU'RE THE WORD HOMELESS CENTER. THE EMPLOYER MICHAEL HI HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET TO WORK YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE A PHONE I CAN'T REACH AND IF I NEED TO. SO THERE'S A LOT OF IT NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT GO AROUND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND SPECIFICALLY OUR FOSTER YOUTH. SO I WOULD JUST APPRECIATE I VOTE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR TODAY IS- MICHELLE A COP CASH. SHE'S THE AREA NEEDS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP DIRECTOR FOR THE ALLIANCE WHO WORKS EVERY DAY WITH FOSTER YOUTH AND FAMILIES HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THANK YOU MISS COPPERS GO HEAD THE- MORNING. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE AND SENATE COMMITTEE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH YOU TODAY.MY NAME IS MICHELLE CAUGHT CASH AND THE IRANIANS DIRECTOR FOR THE ALLIANCE DEFENDING THE CONSECUENCIA WE WERE NONPROFIT THAT SUPPORTS OVER FIFTY AGENCIES AND NONPROFIT GREATER SACRAMENTO REGION THAT ARE DEDICATED TO PROTECTING CHILDREN. AND STRENGTHENING PLEASE. HOW MAY OF YOU HAVE THAT GIVEN A JOB RECOMMENDATION SOMEBODY WITHIN YOUR CIRCLE. OR HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT IN AMERICA ON AVERAGE FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT FROM THEIR PARENTS AT THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO. OR THE IN SIX IN TEN PARENTS SAY THAT THEY'VE GIVEN SOME FINANCIAL HELP TO THEIR ADULT CHILDREN IN THE PAST YEAR THEY'RE OVER SIXTY THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH IN THE SYSTEM WHO OFTENTIMES LACK THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. MEANING THAT FOR THEM THERE WITHOUT THE JOB RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT A CIRCLE OF SUPPORT WITHOUT PADDING FALL BACK ON. WE INVEST SO LITTLE IN THEM YET EXPECT SO MUCH OF THEM BY THE TIME THAT THEY AGE OUT OF THE SYSTEM. ONE OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH ONLY 45% OF THESE CHILDREN WILL EVER BE ADOPTED. THAT MEANS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN WILL AGE OUT OF THE SYSTEM ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND AROUND HALF OF THESE WILL END UP HOMELESS OR INCARCERATED AT SOME POINT. LAST SCHOOL YEAR THERE WERE OVER THIRTY TWO THOUSAND SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN ENROLLED IN THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND TO GIVE YOU A VISUAL OF THAT AND THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH TO FILL FIFTY TWO CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO REGIONAL LOAN THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FOSTER YOUTH WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT. A HALF TO FILL SIX ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. ONLY ABOUT HALF OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH IN OUR SCHOOLS WILL GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL ON TIME. AND DURING THEIR SCHOOL YEARS THE AVERAGE FOSTER YOUTH WILL BE MOVED ON AVERAGE TO BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE DIFFERENT PLACES HOMES. WITH EACH MOVE ANY SEMBLANCE OF A SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD WILL BE BROKEN ONCE AGAIN. DURING THEIR TRANSITION AGE TWO YEARS. MANY MAY ENTER INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAMS AND MOVE INTO UNFURNISHED APARTMENTS WHERE THEY'LL GET HELP FROM NON PROFITS LIKE MIND HELPED HOUSE- AND FURNISH THEIR- THEIR SPACES. YES AT TIMES THEY MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A CAN OPENER AND CAN. FORCE SILVERWARE OR TOILET PAPER. AND IT'S NO WONDER THAT WHEN A TEEN OR YOUNG ADULT AGES OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM ABOUT 50% OF THEM WILL BE WITHOUT A JOB IN FOUR YEARS. ABOUT 25% OF THEM THE INCARCERATED. OVER ONE IN FOUR SOMETIMES UP 231% OF TRANSITION AGE TEENS WILL EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS. IN THE GREATER SEX CRIMINAL REGION ONE THIRD OR 34% OF HOMELESS PEOPLE REPORTED THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN FOSTER CARE. AND A TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN STUDY BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OF SACRAMENTO. ASKED HOMELESS AND TRANSITION TO EASE AGE YOUTH WHAT TWO THINGS COULD SACRAMENTO DUE TO HELP PEOPLE BETTER AND- WHAT TWO THINGS COULD SACRAMENTO DO BETTER TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. 48% OF THE HOMELESS YOUTH ANSWERED PROVIDE MORE JOBS AND TRAINING FOLLOWED BY 44% WINS OR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS JOB CAN PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND PRIORITIZES IMPORTANT DEMOGRAPHIC. THANK YOU WE HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS IN SUPPORT THAT IS THAT CORRECT YES SIR MISS MACLAINE SHE'S ON THE PHONE SIR OKAY CAN YOU PUT IT THROUGH MODERATOR. YEAH GO AHEAD. HELLO AND THANK YOU SENATOR GROW FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CALL IN FOR IN YOUR DISTRICT AND REGION- THE FOR THE SPEAKER RIGHT BEFORE ME DID A GREAT JOB OF TELLING YOU THE STATISTICS THAT SURROUND AND CHILDREN THAT ARE AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE. WE KNOW THAT THE PIPELINE TO THEM MAJORITY OF OUR MAJOR SOCIAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BIG OPINIONS ABOUT AND STEM FROM FOSTER CARE. WHAT HE MENTIONED AND SPENT TIME IN FOSTER CARE. BEDI SHOW ANYWHERE FROM 4280% OF OUR PRISON POPULATION HAS THE BRIDGE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT 70% OF. GIRLS AGED OUT OF FOSTER CARE WILL BE PREGNANT BY THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. ONLY 50% WILL GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND EVEN MORE SHOCKINGLY ONLY 3% WILL GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE DESPITE THE FACT THAT IS- ACCORD TO THE STATE THEY RECEIVED A FREE RIDE TO ANY STATE SCHOOL. YOU HAVE A SAYING THAT SAYS THERE COMES A POINT WHERE WE ADEQUATE PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THE RIVER AND WE HAVE TO TRAVEL UPSTREAM AND FIND OUT WHY THEY'RE FALLING IN. AND THE REALITY IS- BUT IT MAJOR SOCIAL ISSUES IF FOSTER CARE. TODAY BEFORE YOU SENATOR GROW HIS PROPOSED A BILL THAT IS AN UPSTREAM BELL. KERN COUNTY WE HAVE OVER TWO THOUSAND KIDS IN FOSTER CARE- I AM ALISON MACLEAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT BAKERSFIELD ANGELS WHICH IS A NON PROFIT- THAT EXISTS TO WRAP. RELATIONAL AND RADICAL SUPPORT AROUND OUR USE THAT ARE AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN AND KIDS AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE ARE COUNTY. AND THAT ARE MATCHED IN OUR PROGRAMS. AND WE DO WHAT THE THING EVERY DAY SUPPORT THESE KIDS TO HELP LAUNCH THEM FOR THE FUTURE THAT WE DO FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN. AND SO WE DO THINGS LIKE HELP THEM- I APPLIED FOR COLLEGE BEFORE WE HELP THEM. AND GET THEIR FIRST JOB OR WE HELP THEM OBTAIN A DRIVER'S LICENSE. WE HAVE TWELVE YOUTH GRADUATING THIS MONTH FROM HIGH SCHOOL TWELVE OUT OF TWELVE. SO THAT THAT SHOWING US THAT WE CAN USE A RADICALLY SUPPORTED THE OUTCOMES CHANGE. THE REALITY THE WE HAVE A OF LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT WE PARTNER WITH TO GIVE ARGUES SHOT. AND TO GIVE THEM LIKE. BETTER ROADS BETTER CHANCE AT A JOB BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS NECESSARILY MAKE THE VERY BEST EMPLOYEES AT FIRST. THEY TEND TO BE UNRELIABLE AND INCONSISTENT BECAUSE THEY MODELED MODELED THE ADULTS THAT THEY'VE HAD IN THEIR OWN LIVES WHICH ARE UNRELIABLE AND- INCONSISTENT. AND WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BILL IS THIS IS A SENSE OF I MEAN. BUSINESS IS TO GET THESE KIDS A HAND UP NOT A HAND OUT. BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN WE HAVE TO BUILD AT THE STATE LEVEL TO GIVE KIDS FOR MONEY. IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY. FOR HAVING CHILDREN OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS WITH THE MONEY WE HAND THEM OUT OF MY FOR TEENAGE CHILDREN WOULD NOT BY EITHER. AND SO RATHER THAN USING IT TO PAY RENT OR WHATEVER THEY'LL PROBABLY GO OUT AND BUY THE LATEST IPHONE. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE BILL IS THAT WE'RE INCENTIVIZING BUSINESSES. TO HADES YOU FOR ACTUALLY DOING WORK AND OTHER PROGRAMS BUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE KIDS. WERE GIVEN IT TO LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT. THAT THESE KIDS LEARN TO WORK FOR IT. WHAT SENATOR GROW SAID THE- TO POVERTY IS. A J. O. E. AND- THE OTHER REALLY GREAT. ABOUT THIS BILL IS IT GOING TO GET BUSINESS ON. A THE LAND IN TO OUR LOCAL CARE. AND SO MANY DON'T KNOW. I TELL YOU RIGHT AFTER TO GO. I DID NOT KNOWN ANY OF THESE DID AND I HEARD OF. AND A CHECK THAT YOU'RE OF MY LIFE MOST BUSINESS OWNERS DON'T KNOW EITHER AND SO THIS BILL WILL ALLOW US TO PULL BACK THE CURTAIN A LITTLE BIT AND CHANGE THE LENS THROUGH WHICH- BUSINESS OWNERS SEE ARE AFTER YOUR COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE BIG OPINIONS EVERYBODY PROBABLY IN THIS ROOM ABOUT OUR PRISON POPULATION OR HOMELESS POPULATION. FOUR AND- H. PREGNANCY AND ABORTION BILL THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS IN MY OPINION THAT WE CAN AGREE ON LIKE TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE ARE UP UP QUICKLY. YEAH WHAT ARE YOU. ABOUT SHOT THAT THEY CAN. ADD A FEW. AND I THIS BILL THAT I WRAPPED UP THE STORE. AND ACTUALLY I KNOW FOR I NEED TO SAY ONE MORE SENTENCE AND THEN WE NEED TO MOVE ON I APOLOGIZE.

OFF FOR THE SERVICES EVEN WITH A JOB OF THOSE FOSTER YOUTH ARE GOING TO NEED SUPPORT A LOT OF SUPPORT AND WITHOUT THE SUPPORT AROUND THEM THE AND THE THEIR EMPLOYER MAY NOT SUCCEED SO- THAT'S ONE THING I THINK WE NEED TO REMIND OURSELVES THANK YOU. SENATOR LUNAR. I'M THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN I- AND TERRY I SAID THIS BILL AFTER TODAY AND I THANK YOU FOR- FOR- FOR THE BILL TO REALLY HELP- HOMELESS USE AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH TO BE ABLE TO GET JOBS AND GET THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER- I DO WANNA TO NOTE- BUT I WASN'T ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE AUTHORS ON THE CLOTHES BEFORE BUT THERE THERE IS ACTUALLY TI&lt;c.cyan&gt;- WE LOOK AT AND&lt;/c&gt; I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE- DONE A LOT OF WORK AROUNDS- HOMES YOUTH IN FOSTER YOUTH- 40% CASH IT'S NOT YOUTH IDENTIFY AS LGBT- IN ADDITION I ALSO BE T. TO YOU ARE HAVEL OVER A IN THE FALL CARE- SEEM ASK YOURSELF WHY IS A FIVE THAT HOME THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SO INTENSELY OVER REPRESENTED AMONG HOMELESS USE AND YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM GREEN LOOK AT USE OVERALL IN THE WORLD IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT FORTY PLUS PERCENT OF ALL YOUTH ARE. WITH MUCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE BUT ALMOST HALF OF HOMELESS YOUTH ARE LGBTQ AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT PERCENTAGES IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM BUT I'S VERY HIGH WHY IS THAT THIS IS RANDOM NO IT'S NOT RANDOM IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY SOCIETY TREATS THESE CODES THREE TO MY GARBAGE LIKE GARBAGE PEOPLE THAT SOCIETY IS TRYING TO RAISE THEIR OFFER KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOMES THEIR THEIR TREATED HORRIBLE SCHOOL- THEY ARE TOLD FROM EARLY AGE BUT THEY DON'T MATTER THAT THEY HAVE NO WORTH- THAT THEY'RE FAKING IT WE SEE THAT WITH TRANS KIDS ARE PARTICULARLY TRYING TO SCAM YOUR WAY ON TO SPORTS TEAM OR- INTO A RESTROOM- THAT YOU'RE MAKING IT UP AND- MANIPULATING. AND SO IS IT ISN'T WONDER THE DISCO. STRAW WITH RATES OF SO HARM. BUT ALSO WITH HIGHER RATES OF HOMELESS. AND AN ENTRANCE THE FOSTER CARE. AND WITH TRAFFICKED. THIS IS A ROUGH TO A BILL- A- A VERY PROBLEMATIC TO. THAT THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE A FEW WEEKS AGO THE DOT PASSED. OUT OF COMMITTEE- AND SOME OF THE BACKERS OF THAT BILL. SOME OF WHOM. DO NOT HAVE STRONG RECORDS IN SUPPORTING LGBTQ. CIVIL RIGHTS- WORDS. REFERENCING LGBTQ KIDS BEING TRAFFICKED. BETTER SOMEONE LGBTQ ART BELL- AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT. THE WHY LGBTQ KIDS. OR SOMETIMES TRAFFICKED WHEN THEY'RE OUT ONE OUR STREETS AND HAVE NO WAY TO TRY TO EVEN SURVIVE AND ENGAGE IN SURVIVAL SEX WORK THAT THAT'S REAL BATTLES REAL IN OUR SOCIETY AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THERE TREATED BY OUR SOCIETY. AND YEAH ONE PEOPLE LIKE RHONDA SANDERSON GREAT JOB IT AND ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LITERALLY SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT WHO YOU ARE IN SCHOOL BUT IT'S A LEGAL. T. EVEN TALK ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS A HUMAN BEING IN SCHOOL OR THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR PARENTS PUT IN JAIL. BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT HEALTH CARE FOR THE TRANS KID THAT'S NOT POLITICIZING ANYTHING. THAT'S EXPLAINING WHY SO MANY OF THESE KIDS ARE ON THE STREET WHY SO MANY OF THESE KIDS ARE IN FOSTER CARE. WHY SO MANY OF THESE KIDS QUESTION THEIR OWN WORTH AND ENGAGE IN SELF HARM THAT'S NOT POLITICS. THAT IS POLITICS AND POLITICS BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS WHO WERE TRYING TO. THAT WHEREVER THEY'RE TRYING TO GO ON THE BACKS OF CHILDREN. AND THAT EXPLAINS WHY THESE CHILDREN SUFFER SO MUCH- AND SO I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE PUSHING FOR THIS BILL THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND I SUPPORT A HUNDRED PERCENT- AND IF WE CAN HELP THESE KIDS. ON GET OFFICE. EXISTS ACCESS FULLY OUT OF FOSTER CARE GET THEM JOBS THAT'S FANTASTIC AND I COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BUT I DID THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT. TO SERVE EXPLAINED- THESE OTHER DYNAMICS THAT ARE VERY VERY VERY REAL THANK YOU. THE COMMENTS QUESTIONSJUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS BELT- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT- YOU KNOW WE TAKE WE TAKE THE ISSUES. IN PIECES AND TRY TO SOLVE THEM OUT LITTLE BY LITTLE AND- MANY TIMES THERE THERE'S A MUCH BROADER ISSUE THAT- BECOMES DIFFICULT TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND AND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF FOSTER CARE HAS- HAS LONG BEEN A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE WANT TO PROTECT KIDS BUT SOMETIMES WHEN THEY GET INTO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THEY JUST DON'T GET THE HELP THEY NEED- AND I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE- I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK- IN. IN THAT SYSTEM AND IT'S FRUSTRATING- HOW LITTLE SUPPORT FOSTER KIDS GET IN THE END OF DAY MAY BE SAFE FOR IT FOR SOME OF THEM DURING THE EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT THEY'RE THAT THERE ARE CONSIDERED MINERS BUT% THEN AFTER THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY SUPPORT IN AS WE KNOW FAMILY SUPPORT IS. IS EVERYTHING IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WE GOT TO CREATE OUR OWN FAMILY SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- WE DO HAVE A MOTION- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SO WE'RE GONNA LET YOU CAN CLICK. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM SURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE BILL AND ALSO MY CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES- BUT WHAT MISC. SAID I TOUCH MY HEART BECAUSE IT IT IS TRUE YOU KNOW MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT I OWN OF EMPLOYMENT STAFFING COMPANY AND WE PUT AT RISK KIDS SECOND CANCERS SUCH AS OUR OIL INDUSTRY PROS PROVIDES A 55% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE OIL INDUSTRY OUR SECOND CANCERS AND MOST OF THEM WOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO PRISON HAD THEY NOT AND THE HAVE THESE JOBS THAT PAY WELL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. BUT I THINK A LOT OF IN THE OIL HER CULTURE YEAH ARE THE BOILING YEAH REALLY OIL ENACT. EMPLOY MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN THE- CHANCE ON SOMEONE- IT THE I. RE DO BELIEVE THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT CHANCE ON SOMEONE IF THERE WASN'T SOME BENEFIT SO THAT IF THEY DID HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS THEY WOULD AT LEAST HAVE SOME WAY TO RECOUP SOME OF THEIR LOSSES THROUGH TAX CREDIT. AND BUT THESE PROGRAMS FOR SECOND CHANCE THERE'S A MILITARY VETERANS HAS AND- HAVE BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA- THERE'S A HUGE PERCENT OF SUCCESS. WHEN YOU GET SOMEONE A JOB. AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH FOR FOSTER CARE AND YOU. THEY GET SOME OF THESE PLACES GET SIX SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THESE GROUP HOMES IN THESE KIDS WALK OUT OF THERE WITH NOTHING. BUT A PILLOWCASE OR SUITCASE- IF THEY'RE LUCKY AND SO WE DON'T OFFER. A YOU KNOW WRAP AROUND SERVICES I APPLIED- BAKER STILL THE JEWELS. AND DEBT THAT- ERR IF YOU'RE A COMMUNITIES PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ALLIANCE WITH WHAT THEY DO. TO WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR FOSTER CARE YOUTH WE'RE BUILDING A FACILITY IN BAKERSFIELD FOR. HOMELESS TRANSITION WE'VE DEDICATED TWENTY OF THOSE UNITS TO SPECIFICALLY FOSTER CARE. BECAUSE THEY IN AND IT HAS ACCOUNTABILITY IN RAP BROWN SERVICES AND- BECAUSE WE NEED THAT. AND WE'RE ALSO DOING A THING CALLED FOREVER FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY WHICH I WHICH WAS ADOPTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE EIGHTEEN. YOU STILL NEED A FAMILY TO GO HOME TO AND HAVE THANKSGIVING WITH CHRISTMAS. MAYBE TALK TO THE YOU KNOW YOUR SUMMIT ADULT ABOUT. BUYING A CAR OR OPENING A CHECKING ACCOUNT OR YOU NEED THE SKILL SETS THAT A LOT OF OUR FORMER. FOSTER YOUTH HER FOSTER HOMELESS YOU DON'T HAVE.

FIVE HIGHEST HIGHEST RISK TERRITORY WITHIN THE STATE- OF THAT BUT IT ALSO SERVES AS A SUPPORT MECHANISM FOR THE STATE'S OVERALL AGENDA MAKING- A REDUCTION IN OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT- IN LASTLY- I THINK- BY THE UP THE SOLE OPPOSITION THAT WE HEARD- I'M NOT CERTAIN WHY THAT OCCURS BECAUSE THIS IS A GENERAL FUND ASK- FOR- FOR THIS TYPE OF TAX CREDIT AND SO BASED ON WHAT I WAS ABLE TO- DISCERN. IS THAT I THINK ANY OPPOSITION AB WE'RE GONNA STATION JUST RELYING ON GENERAL FUND DOLLARS SO I DON'T IT'S NOT ON THE MERITS THE BILL IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH THAT BEING SAID WE ALL SUFFER FROM WILDFIRES IN SOME OF ITS ALLIES SUFFER EVEN MORE ACUTELY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE MOST EVERYBODY HERE I'M WITH THE EXCEPTION POSSIBLY SENATOR WIENER- EVERYBODY HERE HAS SOME TIER THREE WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HELP THOSE MOST IMPACTED MAKE THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL- INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY.

FOR A GOOD MORNING MENTION ANY VIRTUAL SOURCES ASIAN THANKS FOR THE TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THE BILL WELL THAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE FOLLOWING MY COLLEAGUES SO HE'S GOING TO DO SOME STAGE SETTING BUT I WILL SAY THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE BRINGING ON ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND MAY WANT OF UTILITY SCALE SOLAR. IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT STRIKES A CAREFUL BALANCE BETWEEN MAKING SURE THAT THE- COUNTIES ARE COMPENSATED. FOR CITING THE PROJECTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THE RATE PAYERS ARE NOT DUE UNTIL THE BURDENS WITH A NEW TAXATION. THE OTHER ELEMENT OF THIS BILL HELPS TO- RETAIN COMPETITIVENESS BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND THE NEIGHBORING STATES TAX STRUCTURES. TO HELP PREVENT ACCIDENTS OF PROJECTS FROM CALIFORNIA TO THE OTHER STATES- WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THIS IS A PRETTY TECHNICAL BILL. WE ENGAGED EARLY WITH THE COUNTIES AND ALSO WITH THE ASSESSOR'S. HAVING GOOD PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM AS WELL AND ALSO. APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF BOTH THE IRON WORKERS FOUND THAT LABOUR'S.

THANK YOU OF MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- YEAH MY NAME IS RAJKUMAR FROM WITH THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION- WE ARE THAT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE SOLAR INDUSTRY- AND I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR SB THIRTEEN FORTY. THE BILL IS CRITICAL TO HELPING THE STATE MEETS LONG TERM CLIMATE ENERGY RELIABILITY NEEDS IN A MANNER THAT KEEPS CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE WITH NEIGHBORING STATES INSURERS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SOLAR JOBS STAY IN CALIFORNIA. BY RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT ROLE THE SOLAR ENERGY WITH PLAYING CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MIX THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED PROP SEVEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THIS AUTHORIZED THE CAT THE LEGISLATURE TO EXCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION SOLAR ENERGY SINCE COULD. FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROPERTY TAXATION. SO APPROACH IS REAL HELP TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF SOLAR AND IT IS SUCH THAT NOW IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE PRICE RESOURCES. IN THE STATE'S ENERGY MIX. AND THIS IS VERY CRITICAL TO HELPING THE STATE MANAGES COSTS BECAUSE WE CONTINUE GO FORWARD HOP AND WE TRIPLE THE GRID SIZE OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. FURTHER AND IMPORTANTLY SB THIRTEEN FORTY. ONE FOR THE HOMEOWNERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT USE TO INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY ARE NOT UNNECESSARILY BURDENED BY HIGHER COSTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE- LEADERSHIP OF CENTER HERTZBERG ON THIS MATTER AS WELL THANK YOU.

BERNADETTE HELLO THAN WHAT THE WHITE AMEND GRIP ON BEHALF OF AB ASKED IN SHOCK RIGHT. MADAM CHAIR NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS QUEUED UP VERY GOOD WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OPPOSITE THAT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE ONE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS PAUL YEAR YODER FROM KERN COUNTY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR SHUTTER INTO SCHMELZER LAND WE HAVE THE KERN COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS NOT SURE OF THEIR YES OKAY GREAT SO THE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATIONS. HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS BILL TO. THE THRESHOLD QUESTION WITH THIS BILL IN THIS POLICY IS. THIS IS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA WANT TO CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE A LARGE SCALE SOLAR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE BACKS OF KERN COUNTY AND THE RESIDENTS OF KERN COUNTY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED FOR OVER A DECADE NOW. KERN COUNTY HAS APPROVED SOLAR PROJECTS IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO SUNSET THE SOLAR TAX EXCLUSION. WE'VE DONE THIS EXCLUSION NOW MULTIPLE TIMES. SO IN GOOD FAITH KERN COUNTY WENT ALONG WITH THIS EXTENSIONS OF THIS TAX BREAK TO COMMERCIAL LARGE SCALE SOLAR HAS COST KERN COUNTY A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION OR LESS TEN YEARS TO MEMBERS IMAGINE SAN BENITO LOSING A HUNDRED MILLION OVER TEN YEARS. SHASTA SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES. LOSING THAT SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND CAN AGAIN THIS I THINK AS YOU ALL KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. SO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THIS WAS A NEW AN EMERGING EMERGING INDUSTRY IT ISN'T ANYMORE IT'S A STABLE. LONG TERM INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. THE COUNTIES FISCAL LOSSES HAVE SUBSIDIZE GREEN ELECTRONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. NOW MATURE ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES AND ADJUSTMENTS NEED TO BE MADE BELIEVE SOLAR CAN BE A GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN A LONG TERM INVESTMENT PART PARTNERS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY HERE MEMBERS AND WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION. LANGUAGE CAN BE MORE CAREFULLY AND MORE THOUGHTFULLY CRAFTED WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO RESHAPE ANY TAX CREDIT IN A WAY THAT MAKES THESE INVESTMENTS MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A WAY TO DO THIS THAT WILL ACTUALLY GROW LARGE SCALE SOLAR RATHER THAN HAVE THIS TENSION AND WHAT IS INCREASINGLY FEELING LIKE A FIGHT. I'M GONNA STOP THERE AND- LET'S SEE SACRAMENTO'S REPRESENTED C. SIX WEEKS I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE UNTIL THE LANGUAGE CAN BE CHANGED SO THAT IT BETTER INCENTIVISES LARGE SCALE SOLAR IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. JEFF NEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. WE CAME IN WITH THE CONCERNS POSITION TO THIS COMMITTEE. WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE- SOLAR. INDUSTRY AND THE AUTHOR I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME- SOME REVENUE FROM THESE PROJECTS- SHOULD GO TO THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE CITED- WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM TO. TO SEE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE BALANCES AS- AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS. I WAS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN THAT THIS- THIS THIS A SUBSIDY WE WILL THEY AND AN INCENTIVE OR SUBSIDY IS BORN A PREDOMINANTLY BY. RURAL AREAS THAT HAPPEN TO BE SUNNY- FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE IN THE STATE. AS A WOULD LIKE TO. CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO FOR THE TESTIMONY IN THE ROOM I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE MISTER MODERATOR IF YOU COULD QUEUE UP WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTEEN FORTY EXPRESS OUR BELIEF THAT YOU CAN IMPORTANT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. MADAM CHAIR NOBODY IS GIVING UP. OKAY VERY GOOD WILL BRING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THAT'S FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS CENTER NIELSEN TO CONFESS SOME FRUSTRATION WITH THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. AS HAS BEEN TESTIFIED HERE IT'S BEEN AROUND QUITE A WHILE. IT IS MATURING. IT HAS ITS PLACE IN OUR ENERGY MIX. THE TOO MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF HOW WE CAN BE TO BENDED ON A ONLY AND ENERGY. AND SOLAR ENERGY IT HAS ITS PLACE. BUT IF THAT'S WHERE WE PUT ALL THE EGGS IN OUR ENERGY BASKET. OUR CHILDREN THE GENERATIONS WILL SUFFER GREATLY. THEY AGAIN HAVE THEIR PLACE BUT MY FRUSTRATION IS A SOLAR INDUSTRY SEEMS TO BE QUITE GREEDY. EVERY YEAR SEEKING NEW ADVANTAGES FOR THEM. TO SUSTAIN ITSELF. DOWN ON THE FARM WE CALL IT WINNING THE CALF. MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE WINNING OF THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. AND AS TESTIFIED HERE AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE THE COUNTIES COMING FORTH EXPRESSING CONCERNS CONCERNS. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M VOICE. I DON'T SEE THE SOLAR INDUSTRY HELPING AND SUPPORTING OR EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT BEING AWARE OF COGENERATION. WHICH WOULD HELP US CLEAN UP THE FORCE IN THE WILDLANDS AND CUT DOWN THESE ENORMOUS CATACLYSMIC FIRES THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. THE QUIT BEING SO SELFISH. AND THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE ENERGY BASKET FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SUPPORTING OTHER ENERGY PRODUCING ENTITIES AND HELPING THE COUNTIES AS THEY HAVE EXPRESSED HERE THEIR OWN CONCERNS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR CONCERNS MOTION. CENTER HURT FOR YOU CAN MAKE THE MOTION YEAH. THE SENATOR RAZA MAKES MOTION I DO HAVE A I DO HAVE A COMMENT AND I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE- FROM THE COUNTY- TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW IS CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS INVESTED A- LOT OF. TIME ENERGY AND MONEY ON THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME THAT WE STILL- THAT WE ARE STILL BUYING OUR SOLAR PANELS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WE DON'T EVEN PRODUCE THEM HERE IN IN OUR COUNTRY AND SO FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT AND SAY WE REALLY WANT TO GO GREEN AND YET WE DON'T DO IT OURSELVES IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THAT THOSE ARE JOBS SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE. THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF NEW SMALLER COMPANIES THAT ARE STARTING UP- BUT WE NEED TO. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THEIR SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THAT'S OUR WORKFORCE. SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT- WE HAVE INCENTIVIZE. GREEN TECHNOLOGY. IN THEM WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S BEEN GREAT BUT- BY THE- COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HAD THEWHERE WITH ALL TO. SET UP THE CCA'S. I ALWAYS FORGET WHAT THE ACRONYM STANDS FOR BUT THE CHOICE EXIT HE COMMUNITY CHOICEAGGREGATE THAT'S WHY I CAN NEVER REMEMBER BECAUSE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TWO THOUSAND YEAH AND- AND THAT. THOSE ARE FOR THE MOST PART THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE INVESTED IN THOSE ALTERNATIVE. ENERGY CAN CONGLOMERATES ARE ON THE COAST AND THEIR WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES AND THEY HAVE LESS NEED. WE HAVE THE SAID THEY SAID THEY HAVE A NEED FOR ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE LESS OF A NEED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS HOT AS THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND THEY'RE NOT AS COLD AS THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND MY POINT I'M MAKING WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT- WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. IS BUILD SOLAR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND TRANSPORT THAT ENERGY TO THE COAST AND WHILE THAT'S A GOOD THING- I THINK THE CENTRAL VALLEY I DON'T BENEFIT FROM THAT DEVELOPMENT. AND SO I'VE BEEN ENCOURAGING THE CCA'S. TWO IF THEY'RE GONNA BILL SOLAR PANELS- THAT THEY DO IT. AROUND COMMUNITIES IT REALLY NEED THE ENERGY- WHAT- AND I DO HAVE TO COMMEND THAT. SAN MATTEO CCA FOR BUILDING SOLAR AROUND UNLESS FINANCING THEY'RE GOING TO INCLUDE THE CITY OF LOS FINE YES AND THEY'VE ALSO AGREED. THAT THEY WOULD EXTEND THE SAME OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES MENDOTA FIREBAUGH. SAN JOAQUIN THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND IN THIS GETS BACK TO OUR OUR THAT OUR- ENERGY POLICY GOALS AS WELL AS OUR- CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IS THAT THAT AREA. WILL LOSE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A MILLION ACRES OF AG LAND PRODUCTION ONCE SIGMA CLIQUE KICKS IN SO WE HAVE THESE SEPARATE SYSTEMS RIGHT WE HAVE THE WATER SYSTEM IS SEPARATE THEN ENERGY THAT SEPARATE THEN THEN- LAND USE BUT BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER THE COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY GONNA SUFFER IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RESOURCES THAT HAVE A LOT OF. OF PEOPLE THAT ARE- HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS AND THAT- RELY ON AGRICULTURE THAT ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A LIVELIHOOD AND THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ENERGY IN THERE AND SO WEAK MY POINT ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS THAT- WE NEED TO SHARE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT HAVE SOLAR PANELS ARE GOING INTO COUNTY THAT THEY SHARE IN THE BENEFIT OF THE SOLAR PANELS AS WELL AS WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I HEAR THAT THAT- THERE'S SOME MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND I WILL I WILL I AM. ASSUMING THAT YOU WILL APPLY TO THE COURT WILL GET THERE AND SO UP WITH THAT YOU MAKE INCLUDE. THEM THE MAGIC THAT'S TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF CALIFORNIA. INFORMED BY FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. EACH OF US HAVE RESPECTED BURDENS. EACH OF US CONTRIBUTE IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO WHAT IS CALIFORNIA. THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE HARBOR. THOSE TRACTORS WOULD COME TO. PLOW THOSE FIELDS COME FROM A LOT OF THOSE SHIPS. THAT THOSE KIDS ARE. SUCKING UP THAT THE ASTHMA AND THE PROBLEMS THEY FACE BECAUSE THE TRACTORS. HOW MANY PEOPLE FROM EACH OF THE COUNTIES GO TO. SANDALS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. AND UTILIZE THAT FACILITY. WHAT COUNTIES ARE ENGAGED IN SELF HELP AND WHICH COUNTIES ARC. THE QUESTION IS WE IS A STATE. IN THE BIG PICTURE POLICY THIS INFORMED BY THE QUESTIONS HERE IN THE- OPPOSITION HERE. HAVE AN OBLIGATION. WE SIT BACK IN A RIP IN A AND R. AGENCIES TELL US THAT WE'VE GOT TO PRODUCE SEVENTY GIGAWATTS SEVENTY GIGAWATTS SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR POWER. TO MEET THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO WE'RE CREATING THIS EXTRAORDINARY TRANSITION. THAT'S HAPPENING AT A TIME WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE WATCHED TECHNOLOGY CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. AND YOU KNOW I TRY TO BUILD THE SOLAR FACTORY IN LOS ANGELES IT DIDN'T WORK. THE BILL FOR OFFICERS THAT WE SHOULD PUT EVERY ONE OF THOSE JOBS SHOULD BE HERE. AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IN LOOKING AT THE ECONOMICS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JOBS WITH RESPECT TO UTILITY GRADE SOLAR DON'T GO TO THE STATE. BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT MONEY WE WANT THOSE JOBS HERE WE WANT THAT THOSE FACILITIES TO BE BUILT HERE WE DON'T WANT THEM IN A NEIGHBORING STATE THAT ALSO HAVE SON. THAT MUCH MORE TO BE JUST POLICY. EXES SO YES IT'S MATURED DRAMATICALLY YES THE TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED JUST THE PRICING HAS GONE DOWN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A AS AS A STATE. TO MOVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE AND THIS IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT. AND I'VE HAD SOME VERY IMPORTANT INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM KERN COUNTY AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR- THEIR POINT OF VIEW I GET IT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU TALK IT LANDED ABUSE OTHERWISE WHAT'S THOSE OTHER REVENUE STREAMS- IS REVENUE FROM THIS. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO FIGURE OUT. WE CAN BALANCE. AS THINGS CHANGE I THINK A LOT OF THIS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW IS WE'RE GOING TO BE GREEN HYDROGEN WHICH IS BASICALLY SOLAR CELLS AND WATER. MAKING HYDROGEN WHICH IS GONNA BE EXPORTABLE YOU CAN PUT IN PIPES YOU CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS. I THINK WE'RE IN THIS DEVELOPING STAGES OF WHAT'S GOING ON WE MADE THE SUN SETS BECAUSE WE MADE ANTICIPATIONS WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WOULD BE. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE- JUST FINISHED CAMANCHE HERE IS THAT WE'RE NOT THERE YET THAT WE HAVE TO SEND MARKET SIGNALS THE COMPANIES TO INVEST. AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND SO. I WOULD JUST SUGGEST TO YOU. THAT THIS IS A THOUGHT AND INTO. APPROACH THAT IS NOT BEING PACKAGE. IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO MARKET SIGNALS. AND WHERE WE ARE I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE FOREVER. BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS IS NECESSARY FOR US. TO ACTUALLY HARMONIZE AND MEET THE GOALS AND EVERYBODY TO CARE THE WRIST CARRY THE RESPECTIVE BURDENS. OF WHAT'S NECESSARY YOU KNOW ALL THE GOODS MOVING THE COMES OUT OF LA AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS INFORM ALL OF US. SO WITH THAT. I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFFERS MADE SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES TO IT. LAST YEAR I BOUGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE MOTION IS. DO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATORS CAPITO HI CABALLERO HI NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO DURAZO TERRAZZO HI HERTZBERG HERTZBERG HI WIENER RIGHT WIENER HI. FORTY ONE. THE BILL IS OUT. FOUR TO ONE. I AM LOOKING FOR AUTHOR CENTER BRADFORD. YOU'RE GOING. SENATOR BRADFORD WE'RE GOING TO START WITH S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY ONE. THE TO THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MA'AM AND CHEER AND I AM HERE TO PRESENT TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WHAT TOOL ONE LUMINATE THE CANNABIS CULTIVATION TAX AND REDUCE EXCISE TAX ON CANNABIS PRODUCTS IS WILL ALSO MOVE THE POINT. OF TAX COLLECTIONS FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR TO THE RETAILER OR POINT OF SALE I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- AND ANALYSIS AS WE ALL KNOW AND CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN VOTERS APPROVED THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR THE CONTROL REGULATE AND TAX ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA ACT. WHILE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARE STILL MINUTES EARLY STAGES CANNABIS INDUSTRY STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE AS LEGALLY OPERATED BUSINESSES WITH MANY ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE NOW DECEMBER LAST YEAR DIVERSE GROUP OF CANNABIS BUSINESS LEADERS AND CONSUMERS ALERTED TO POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE. THAT THEIR INDUSTRY WAS IN CRISIS STRUGGLING TO OPERATE IN FACE AN IMMINENT LOSS OF THEIR BUSINESSES NOT ONLY HERE IN THE STATE. BUT I ATTENDED A CONFERENCE LAST DECEMBER IN A LAND OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE WOULD BLOCK STATE LEGISLATORS. AND THIS IS A CRISIS ALL OVER UNITED STATES SPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO EQUITY OPERATORS. AND THEY'RE HOPING THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE. THE INDUSTRY REPORTED THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A ROBUST LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET IS BEING SQUANDERED BECAUSE OF. EXCESSIVE TAXATION AND OVERREGULATION FOR OUR REGULATIONS LEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS ARE AT LEAST 50% MORE EXPENSIVE. THAN ON THE ILLICIT- UNDERGROUND MARKET CALIFORNIA TAX POLICIES RESULTING IN AN ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ILLICIT MARKET TO EXPAND. AND MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES TO COMPETE WITHOUT SOME KIND OF REAL MEANINGFUL SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE I AM AFRAID THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS DESTINED TO FAIL SB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WOULD ELIMINATE CANNABIS CULTIVATION TAX REDUCED EXCISE TAX. FROM 15% 25% AND MOVE THE POINT OF COLLECTION OF THE EXCISE SAYS FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR% THE RETAILER. WILL TO CULTIVATION EXCISE TAX ARE CURRENTLY COLLECTED AT THE POINT OF ISTRIBUTION OFTEN REQUIRING CANNABIS RETAILERS TO PAY ACCESS TAX BEFORE EVER- MAKING A SELL ON CANNABIS SO IN ESSENCE YOU'RE PAYING FOR INVENTORY I MEAN OPINION ATTACKS ON INVENTORY THAT YOU MIGHT NOT NEVER STILL AND AS WE ALL KNOW ALL OF. THESE PRODUCTS HAVE EXPIRATION DATE AND I'VE VISITED- RETAILERS AS WELL AS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WHERE. THEY HAVE TO GO OUT IN- DISPOSE OF- WHY A BIT OF THIS PRODUCT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEY ALSO JUST CAN'T PUT IT IN THE TRASH CAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIAL- RECYCLER ARE COLLECTOR TO COME IN AND- HANDLES SITUATION. WHICH IS ADDITIONAL COST AND BURDEN TO THE BUSINESS. AND WHILE THE ELIMINATION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX AND A REDUCTION OF EXCISE TAX MAY DECREASE TAX REVENUE FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE REVENUE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT YOU WILL HAVE GREATER DEMAND FROM THE LEGAL OPPORT OPERATORS WILL TOOL MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE AND- FROM GOING FROM GOING TO DRIVE MORE- BUSINESSES TO THE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS VERSUS THE LEGAL. OUR UNTIL THE MARKET CAN SYMBOLIZE INCREASE CELLS. ARE REALIZE WERE PRESENT PURSUING A GENERAL FUND REVENUE. TO OFFSET ANY REDUCTION IN THE CANNABIS TAX FUND TO ENSURE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON THAT WILL. CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THIS MEASURE AND I HAVE A WITNESS HERE TO TESTIFY. ON BEHALF I THINK IT'S A MEETING CONSTRUED. VERY GOOD WE HAVE AMY CHEN HAD FROM THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WELCOME YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION HERE TO EXPRESS OUR ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT FOR SB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE. AND TO CONVEY OUR SINCERE APPRECIATION TO SENATOR BRADFORD ON BEHALF OF OUR OVER FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS FOR INTRODUCING THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS WERE CLEAR ABOUT THEIR EXPECTATIONS WHEN THEY PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WHICH STATED AND I QUOTE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PEOPLE AND ACTING THIS ACT TO TAKE. NON MEDICAL MARIJUANA PRODUCTION AND SALES OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET AND TO TAX THE GROWTH AND SALE OF MARIJUANA. IN A WAY THAT DRIVES OUT THE ILLICIT MARKET AND QUOTE. SB TWELVE ANYONE OFFERS MEANINGFUL TAX REFORM FOR CALIFORNIA'S REGULATED CANNABIS INDUSTRY BY ADDRESSING MANY OF SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES THAT ARE DRIVING LEGAL OPERATORS AND CONSUMERS TO THE ILLICIT MARKET. A RECENT STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE REASON FOUNDATION WHICH WILL BE RELEASED LATER TODAY. EXAMINES CONSUMER PURCHASING HABITS AND FOUND A CLEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS TAX RATES AND CONSUMER PARTICIPATION IN THE LEGAL MARKET. AND ANALYZING THE TAXATION OF LEGAL CANNABIS THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE COMBINATION OF CALIFORNIA'S CULTIVATION AN EXCISE TAX COUPLED WITH LOCAL TAXES CAN BE AS HIGH AS NINETY DOLLARS PER OUNCE. WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE DOLLARS PER POUND. FOR COMPARISON LEGAL CANNABIS TAXES AVERAGED THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY A POUND IN OREGON AND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX POUND IN COLORADO. FINDINGS FURTHER VALIDATED PREVIOUS REPORTS THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY APPROXIMATELY THIRD. SHOULD BE. BASED ON THE STATE'S POPULATION AN ESTIMATED ADULT USAGE RATES AND SHOWS THAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF ALL CANNABIS SALES CONDUCTED IN CALIFORNIA STILL TAKE PLACE IN THE ILLICIT MARKET. FURTHER EXACERBATING THESE ISSUES AS A STATE WIDE LACK OF ACCESS TO LEGAL CANNABIS RETAILERS. SINCE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA LOCALITIES HAVE BANNED THE SALE OF CANNABIS MORE THAN HALF OF THE STATE'S READ LEGAL RETAILERS ARE LOCATED AND JUST EIGHTEEN CITIES. DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF LOWER TAXES AND GREATER ACCESS TO LEGAL RETAILERS RESIDENTS IN OREGON SPEND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MORE PER CAPITA ON LEGAL CANNABIS I RESIDENTS IN COLORADO SPEND THREE HUNDRED AND 35% MORE PER CAPITA ON LEGAL CANNABIS. THAN RESIDENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE LEGAL CANNABIS PRICES MORE NEWMAN HAD TO ASK YOU TO OKAY IT TO THE END NO PROBLEM SO SB TWO TWELVE EIGHTY ONE IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY TAX REFORM BILL THAT OFFERS GENUINE REFORM WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO STABILIZING CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET. AND CURBING THE STATE'S ILLICIT MARKET SO FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE HAVE PAMELA LOPEZ FROM CAN NORMAL. CALIFORNIA NORMAL GOOD MORNING PAM LOPEZ WITH K. STREET CONSULTING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA NORMAL. I WHICH IS THE STATE'S CANNABIS CONSUMER RIGHTS AND CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUP. WE ARE HAPPY TO SUPPORT SB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE AND THANK SENATOR BRADFORD FOR INTRODUCING HAS THIS BILL AND HIS WORK ON THIS ISSUE. REDUCING CANNABIS TAXES IS CRITICAL IF THE STATE WHICH IS TO BRING THE TWO THIRDS OF CANNABIS CONSUMERS. WHO ARE STILL BUYING BLACK MARKET CANNABIS INTO THE LEGAL ECONOMY. IT IS BETTER FOR THEIR HEALTH AND IT WILL ALSO HELP THE STATE MEET THEIR CANNABIS TAX REVENUE GOALS. AS MS JENKINS MENTIONED- THE REASON FOUNDATION WILL BE RELEASING A REPORT LATER TODAY. THAT SHOWS THAT REDUCING CANNABIS TAXES WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE STATE CANNABIS TAX REVENUES. ARE BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE WILL BUY LICENSED PRODUCTS I AND BE PAYING THOSE TAXES. THE FACT THAT TWO THIRDS OF CANNABIS CONSUMERS ARE STILL BUYING ILLEGAL CANNABIS IS A CRITICAL PART OF THIS ANALYSIS. IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY CONSUMERS WHO AREN'T ABLE TO PAY THESE HIGH TAXES. THAT WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH ROOM TO GROW IN TERMS OF BRINGING NEW TAXPAYERS. INTO THE ECONOMY WITH LOWER TAXES. THE REPORT SHOWS THAT THE DIVISION TAX ZERO OUT. AND THAT THE EXCISE TAX CAN BE LOWERED SIGNIFICANTLY- AND THAT THE CANNABIS TAX BASE WILL STILL GROW SUBSTANTIALLY. IN CALIFORNIA WE ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO TAKE ACTION NOW I AM BRING MORE CONSUMERS INTO THE TAX PAYING CANNABIS ECONOMY. BOTH FOR THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY AND TO MEET THE STATE'S CANNABIS TAX REVENUE GOALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT.

OPENING 81% EVEN GREATER CHALLENGES FOR USE IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND SENATOR MCGUIRE STILL. IT TO ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL. BECAUSE OF THE FAR GREATER TAX CUTS BUT MUCH LARGER AMOUNTS IN PERMANENTLY SB KOBE ONE WILL REQUIRE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. TO BE SEIZED THE SUBSIDIZED PROFITS THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A CENTRAL PACKED FUNDED PROGRAMS FROM CHILD CARE TO USE PREVENTION DIVERSION FROM INCARCERATIONS. ARE UNINSURED OR STRUGGLING FOR COVERAGE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AFTER TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC THAT KILLED A MILLION PEOPLE HAD HI TO SALES FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN FUNDING. YES THIS BILL WOULD DIVERSE FORMS OF CONTROLLERS TO HELP EDUCATION RACIAL JUSTICE HOUSING OR OTHER NEEDS TO GIVE IT TO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. WHY TARGETED BREAKS THE EQUITY LICENSEES MAKES SENSE AND IT'S NOT WHAT IS PROPOSED THE VAST MAJORITY BENEFITS WILL GO TO THE LICENSEES WHO ARE NOT ACTUALLY LICENSEES. SADLY ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OF OUR FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS AND CREATED EQUITY LICENSING PROGRAM THAT IS THE PROBLEM. WE NEED TO FIX. THE BILL LOOKS PROFITS REDUCED. CAN BE. WE BECOME. BY SALES. THAT WILL BEGIN EVERY STOPS ABUSE FOR GOAL OF THE STATE. IT IS NOT CLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT DOES INCREASE SALES WOULD COME FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET OTHER THAN CONGRESSIONAL WIDESPREAD. USE TARGETED MARKETING OF THE INDUSTRY. WHAT CANNABIS BOTH HAVE VALID MEDICAL USES OF CANNABIS IS NOT STRAWBERRIES. CANNABIS IS NOW THE LEADING CAUSE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FOR TEENS DAILY OR NEAR DAILY CANNABIS USE AMONG CALIFORNIA DON'T CRIPPLE THE PAST DECADE.

MENTIONED EARLIER COMMISSION BY DOT LEGAL ANALYSIS BY MR COHEN CONCLUDED THAT THESE ARE INADMISSIBLE AMENDMENTS TO PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IN CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT AND PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSITION.

AND WHILE CALIFORNIA'S CLEARED THE PATH FOR CANNABIS INDUSTRIES TO OPERATE LEGALLY MANY OF THE COUNTLESS VISITORS ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE THRUSH THOSE OF OUR OWN BY WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OUR EQUITY OPERATOR SO- IT'S A CRISIS AND AS I STATED I ATTENDED A CONFERENCE ON IN DECEMBER AND ATLANTA WHERE WE HAD OVER FOUR HUNDRED STATE LEGISLATORS FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THEY'RE ALL SAYING THE SAME THING THAT. EQUITY OPERATORS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN EVEN THOUGH THE MODEL ARE LEGISLATION SB TWELVE NINETY FOUR WHICH ARE OUT THERE THREE YEARS AGO FOUR YEARS AGO TO CREATE THE FIRST SOCIAL SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY IT'S FAILING MISERABLY. AND ENTREAT ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. REPORTING TWENTY TWO ONE BY THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION NOTES THAT WHILE THE BARRIERS TO MARKET ENTRY ARE HIGH FOR. ANY CANNABIS OPERATOR THE ODDS ARE AGAINST AVERAGE EQUITY OPERATOR WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES AND ADVANTAGES. OF OTHER OPERATORS IN THE MARKETPLACE REPORT RECOMMENDS PROVIDING TAX RELIEF AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT CANNABIS SOCIAL EQUITY. OPERATORS FEDERAL LAW IN TAX EQUITY AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT PROHIBITS TAXPAYERS FROM DEDUCTING OR CLAIMING. FOR ANY AMOUNTS PAID OR IN CURE. INCURRED IN CARRYING ON ANY TRADE OR BUSINESS AND SUCH TRADE OR BUSINESS CONSIST OF TROPIC KING IN A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. SINCE CANNABIS CONTINUES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A SCHEDULE ONE CONTROLLED STOP SUBSTANCE A BUSINESS THE SALES CANNABIS EVEN IN THE STATE WERE IN THIS LEAGUE IT IS LEGAL CANNOT DEDUCT ORDINARY. AND NECESSARY BUSINESS EXPENSES. FROM OTHER FEDERAL TAXES ONE WAY TO A FACT GOAL OF FINANCIALLY HOPING EQUITY OPERATORS TO THE STATE TAX CREDIT FOR CANADA'S BUSINESS RELATED TO EXPENSES. DUCKS CREDIT WOULD REDUCE THE TAX LIABILITY OF EQUITY THE CANNABIS OPERATORS ARE BROUGHT PROVIDE SOME RELIEF THAT MAY HELP THEIR BUSINESSES SURVIVE THIS WILL STOP TO TAX CREDIT THAT WILL ALLOW. A LICENSE EQUITY OPERATORS IN CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY COULD NOT WRITE OFF BUSINESS RELATED EXPENSES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE TAX CREDIT WOULD HELP EQUITY CANNABIS OPERATORS THAT WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY.

INCLUSIVE TWELVE NINETY THREE INCLUDES A SUNSET DATE OF DECEMBER THIRTY ONE ON TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN HERE TESTIFY WILL MISTER SHOCKLEY IS NOT YOUR TESTIFIED WE HAVE A REPLACEMENT HERE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. YES WE HAVE KALO FERGUSON THE DEPUTY DEPUTY DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA EQUITY COUNCIL YES THANK YOU. THERE'S MY NAME IS COME OVER. I'M IF YOU'RE FOR CANNABIS EQUITY POLICY COUNCIL. C. P. REPRESENTS HUNDRED OF CANNABIS EQUITY ENTREPRENEURS OF ALL LICENSE TYPES ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING EQUITY OPERATOR FROM SACRAMENTO THE BAY AREA LOS ANGELES AND EMERGING SAN DIEGO MARKET. OUR GOAL IS TO PROMOTE MEDICAL CANNABIS POLICY AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. ANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING A COMMERCIAL CANNABIS BUSINESS. HOWEVER WHAT MANY OF YOU THE PUBLIC DO NOT KNOW DO NOT REALIZE THAT THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND THE CAMERAS INDUSTRY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER. TO LEGITIMATE EQUITY OPERATORS. A TWENTY SEVENTEEN MARIJUANA BUSINESS DAILY REPORT FOUND THAT FIVE POINT SEVEN CANNABIS BUSINESSES FOUNDERS IDENTIFIED AS LATINO. FOUR POINT 3% IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN AMERICAN AND TWO POINT FOR PERSONS AS ASIAN. SEVERAL OF THE SAME OBSTACLES THAT LEAD TO INEQUITIES FOR COMMITTEES OF COLOR. AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN INDUSTRIES LIKE HOUSING AND HEALTH CARE ARE CREATING THE SAME CHALLENGES IN THE CANNABIS MARKET. AMONG OTHER THINGS IT IS HOW IT IS MORE CHALLENGING FOR EQUITY OPERATORS TO ACQUIRE INITIAL CAPITAL FINANCING. IS MORE CHALLENGING FRANKLY OPERATORS TO FIND ELIGIBLE REAL ESTATE AND IT'S HOUSING TO GO TO THE LICENSING PROCESS. CANADA'S EQUITY OUT OF THE NORTH FACE PROBLEMS RELATED TO ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT'S A PRESS THEIR ABILITY TO REACH OPTIMAL GROWTH RATES. THE HIGH TAX RATE INDUSTRY PAIRED WITH THE INABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL THEREBY HINDERS THE ABILITY OF EQUITY OPERATIVE TO COMPETE WITH LARGER OPERATIONS. IN THIS IS THE PAPERWORK NECESSARY TO APPLY FOR CANNABIS LICENSE. FOR NORTH MUST ALSO PROVE THAT THEY ARE BONA FIDE EQUITY APPLICANTS. THIS REQUIRES BUSINESS BUSINESS OWNERS SELECT ONES HERE TODAY. THE DOCTOR THIS NO HOOPS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR A LICENSE. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THESE WHO CAN GO TO GOING TO A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE WINDOW TO FILE FOR ONE COVERED INITIAL SPOTS. ONE OF THE COVETED MISSILES BUT FRANKLY LICENSES AND PROCESS THAT LED TO A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY. EACH OF THESE CHALLENGES COMES WITH INCREASED COST EQUITY ENTREPRENEURS ADDITIONAL LEGAL FEES THE TIME SPENT FOR RESEARCH AN EXTRA PAPERWORK. AND OTHER RESOURCES WE HAVE NEEDED THEY HAD NEED TO SPEND AWAY FROM THEIR BUSINESS PLANS. THIS LED TO A HUGE DISADVANTAGE FOR EQUITY OPERATORS BEFORE WE BEFORE THEY EVEN OPENED THE DOORS. TO THE BUSINESS FOR PUBLIC. SB TWELVE NINE THREE. IS CRITICAL BECAUSE PROVIDES EQUITY OPERATORS SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL RELIEF NEEDED TO ALLOW THE BUSINESS TO THRIVE. THIS BUSINESS HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN EQUITY AND NON EQUITY BUSINESSES. THE FUNDING FROM TAX CREDITS HEALTH EQUITY BUSINESS RECOUP SOME OF THE COSTS THAT WE NEED. THEY NEED TO USE OUR A TF CARD TO USE IN OTHER AREAS TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS I SOCIAL EQUITY OPERATORS.

TWELVE NINETY SO COMMITTEE MEMBERS- WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME WE STARTED AT NINE O'CLOCK THIS MORNING AND- AND BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER COMMITTEE HEARING TO START AT ONE THIRTY AND THIS ROOM IS NEEDED- BY ONE THIRTY SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO- FOR THE REMAINING CASE THAT BILLS IS TO SET UP A FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR EITHER SIDE SO THAT WE CAN. TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THROUGH ALL OF THAT WITNESSES THAT WANT TO TESTIFY AND ANNOUNCED THAT THE WITNESSES TO BE AS SUCCINCT AS POSSIBLE- IN ORDER FOR US TO YOU KNOW APPROPRIATELY HERE BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET AS MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE LINE AS POSSIBLE SO- CENTER WELCOME THANK YOU WELL- SO LET ME THINK THE COMMITTEE IN THE CHAIR. TIME IT ANY GIVEN TO THIS. ALSO WE DISCUSS THE SUPPORT ISSUE THAT WOULD ARE YOU TODAY- HAVE YOU TAKE THE AMENDMENTS IN THE- COMMITTEE ALL THE AMENDMENTS. ARE THIS YEAR OUR LEGISLATURE IS ENGAGED IN IMPORT DEBATE OVER AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE MORE REASONABLE AFFORDABLE LEGAL PATHWAYS FOR STREET AND MOBILE VENDING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE- THE EFFORT FOR A BUILT UPON THE GROUND BREAKING WORK OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR- AND COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA TO DECRIMINALIZE STREET VENDING. IT'S A BILL THAT I BUT IF- AND- WHEN IT PASSED AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE WORK OF OUR COLLEAGUE LENA GONZALEZ IS WORK TO TRY TO MAKE ESSENTIAL REFORMS OF THE RETAIL FOOD CODE. IN HER BILL THAT SHE HAS MOVING I WHICH PASS AND HEALTH COMMITTEE RECENTLY TO COME BEFORE THIS BODY FOR LATER THIS MONTH- NOW. BY BRINGING THIS BILL TO YOU TODAY BECAUSE IT'S MY SINCERE BELIEF THAT IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE INCLUDING MY DISTRICT SICKLY HIGH TOURIST AREAS CHARLIE I TOURIST AREAS ARE THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE THERE'S A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE BUT BUT IT BUT IT BUT A NOT INSIGNIFICANT- FOLKS WHO ARE EXPLOITING THE GOODWILL. OF ARE MORE PERMISSIVE VENDING LAWS TO OPERATE WITH THAT DEGREE OF IMPUNITY AND DISREGARD FOR PROPERTY PUBLIC SAFETY. AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AS THIS BILL IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED TO MAKE A VERY MODEST CHANGE. TO THE CIVIL PENALTY FRAMEWORK THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD UTILIZE IN THE YOU REGULATE REGULATION STREET VENDING. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE OPTION TO IMPOSE A HIGHER FINE ON VENDORS WHO WERE CITED FOR THE EXACT SAME VIOLATION FOUR OR MORE TIMES WITHIN A ONE YEAR PERIOD. HOWEVER TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION A LOCAL GOVERNMENT MUST ALSO. ONE ESTABLISH IN DISTRICTS DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO ANY AREAS WHERE THEY BANNED EITHER STATIONARY OR ROAMING SIDEWALK VENDORS TO. IDENTIFY VENDING DISTRICTS IN BANNED AREAS ON THEIR WEBSITE THROUGH PROMINENT SIGNAGE AND TO ADDRESS LANGUAGE ISSUES PROST ONLINE ALL VENDING REGULATIONS IN THE MOST TO MOST COMMONLY SPOKEN LANGUAGES IN THE JURISDICTION. CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT WAYS TO- TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF THE BILL IF THAT'S OF INTEREST TO THE TO THE FOLKS HERE- THIS COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL ALSO REQUIRE THE GO BIZ ISSUE REPORT ON THE EXTENT OF NON COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL SIDEWALK VENDING ORDINANCES IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. IMPOSE A THREE YEAR SUNSET- SO THAT THOSE WHO SUPPORT THIS BILL MUST RETURN TO SACRAMENTO TO SHOW THAT THE LAW IS WORKING AS INTENDED. THE LEGISLATION SUPPORTED AND SPONSORED BY THE CITY SANTA MONICA- BECAUSE IN HIGHLY TRAFFICKED TOURIST DESTINATIONS SUCH AS THE SANTA MONICA PIER SAFE REGULAR. NURSES BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING. A CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS UTILIZING THE CIVIL PENALTY STRUCTURE UNDER CURRENT STATUTE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOCK. ROGUE VENDORS FROM OPERATING IN AN UNSAFE MANNER IN THE CITY. HAS CHOSEN. I TO CREATE A TASK FORCE TO BRING POLICE OFFICERS TO THE PIER TO ENFORCE CRIMINAL PENALTIES. NOW YOU MAY I HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT TO THE- TO THE- OPPONENTS OF THE BILL- YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE- I GUESS THE COMMENT THAT YOU HEAR A LOT AS WELL A LOT OF THESE ACTIVITIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL SO THE BILL'S UNNECESSARY. BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THE PROBLEM THAT WE RUN INTO WITH THAT ARGUMENT IS THAT IT BASICALLY. WE'RE BASICALLY TELLING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T SOLICIT EVEN SLIGHT MODIFICATION CIVIL. I'M AND AS A RESULT YOUR PRACTICE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT CITIES LIKE SANTA MONICA ARE JUST GONNA INSTEAD ALL THEY ALL THEY CAN DO IS JUST PUT IN MANY MORE POLICE AT GREAT COST- AND ALSO A YOU KNOW TO ENFORCE THE CRIMINAL PENALTIES THAT ARE STILL AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT BELIEVE IT THAT'S NOT ULTIMATELY IN THE INTEREST OF THE FOLKS. WHO ARE BEING ADVOCATED FOR BY SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. SO MY STAFF AND I'VE BEEN TALKING THE OPPONENTS THIS BILL SINCE LAST YEAR- WE- WE SHARE THEIR SINCERE VISION. TO BRING MORE VENDORS OUT OF THE SHADOWS TO LEGITIMATE THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY. AROUND THE STATE- I'VE OFFERED I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE IN A MOMENT MAKING AN ACRONYM MY BILL CONTINGENT ON THE NOT GONNA CENTER GONZALEZ IS LEGISLATION BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVE THAT CHANGES TO THE RETAIL FOOD CODE. ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MOBILE VENDORS TO GET LICENSED. BUT WHERE I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION IS IN THEIR ASSERTION THAT NOTE CHANGES THERE'S LITTLE NO. ROOM FOR CHANGE WE MADE A CIVIL PENALTY FRAMEWORK IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE TO BOLSTER SINCERE EFFORTS BY CODE ENFORCEMENT. TO ENSURE THE VENDING IS OCCURRING IN A SAFE MANNER. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE VERY MODEST CHANGES SUCH AS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE- COMMITTEE- TO THE FRAMEWORK IN CONCERT WITH CONTINUE TO BUILD A MORE EQUITABLE FINANCIALLY ACCESSIBLE PATH TO LEGAL MUMBO. AND STREET VENDING. SO JOINING ME IF I IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY ARE CINEMA CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FLANIGAN THING AND- RANDALL SCOTT WHO'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PHYSICIANS WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR ALL WHO TESTIFIED ON. YOU KNOW I HAD TO TWENTY A COUPLE OF ISSUES AND CONCERNS I HAVE AND A COUPLE ISSUE THOUGHT SOMEONE TO SHARE. WITH THE PUBLIC AND WITH THE AUTHOR- YOU I'D COMMITTED TO THE CHAIR IF YOU TOOK THE AMENDMENTS AND I'M SAYING YOU YOU ARE TAKING AMENDMENTS GESTURE PROPOSED COMMITTEE PROPOSED. THAT WOULD VOTE FOR TODAY AND IT SAID THE SAME THING TO YOU AND MY WORD MATTERS. I AM IT YOU KNOW BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M GOING TO DO IT ON THE FORMIDABLE IN THE FLOOR AND HERE'S THE REASON AND I A AND IT'S MY FAULT TO SOME EXTENT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE OPPOSITION. I THINK IT WAS SEVEN SEVEN BILLS THAT I DID WITH THE WESTERN CENTER OF THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS IN WITH FEES AND FINES IN THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF FEES AND FINES AS A TOOL. NECESSARY TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND HOW THESE FEES AND FINES PRECLUDE TESTIMONY CREATES SOME CHALLENGES- WANT TO TAKE SOME TIME WITH THEM IF IT'S OKAY TO THE COMMITTEE IT AFTER THIS SUSPENSION TIMES COMMITTED THAT I WOULD DO BECAUSE I HAVEN'T DONE THAT. AND IT'S KIND OF A FAUCET. BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE ARE THEY WERE GETTING FROM THE- WE ARE TO TALK. THAT AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT WHOSE IMPACT WITH THAT LOOKS LIKE A BLUE BOOK FOR TODAY. I PROMISED MADE IT. REALLY MATTERS USUAL WORD. AND A AND THE DAY I JUST WANT TO SHARE THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO THE OPPOSITION DID COME BY MY OFFICE AND TO TALK TO MY STAFF AND I HAD THE CHANCE TO BE BRIEF. SO I CERTAINLY TALK TO THE SIDE TALK TO YOU IN A CERTAINLY TALK TO THE CHAIR IN THAT REGARD SO I. WANT TO SUPPORT TODAY BECAUSE MY WORDS WORDS. BUT I WANT TO DRILL INTO IT IF I COULD SPEAK TAKE A LITTLE OF YOUR TIME- SENATORS. AND ALSO I'D LIKE TO- YOU TO FURTHER DISCUSS IT NOT NOW BUT JUST. THE ID YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING. ABOUT DOUBLE JOINING THIS WITH CENTER GONZALEZ IS SEVEN NINETY TWO. IN TERMS OF THE PAST TOGETHER AS A TEAM. RIGHT OR OR EVEN SINGLE JOINT WHERE WHERE THOSE ARE WHERE HER BILL WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON THE PASSAGE OF OUR OKAY SINGLE SHOW THAT WERE. INITIALLY A WORKING TOGETHER I DON'T ADDRESS THAT IS A POSSIBILITY OF A SOLUTION TO LET'S ALL CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU GUYS OKAY. IT'S GOING TO MAKE THAT CLEAR IT'S MY FAULT FOR. NOTHING REALLY I PROCEED TO COMMONSENSE CENTER AND I'VE BEEN VERY SUPPORT OF ALL YOUR WORK WITH WESTERN CENTER OTHERS. ON IT. BINDS AND- YOU KNOW THIS IS. THAT WE'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND A PATH HERE THAT WILL ALLOW FOR SOME SORT OF- YEAH ACCOUNTABILITY ASSOCIATE WITH THE PROBLEMS. RIGHT I'M YOU KNOW THERE THE IMPOUNDMENT WAS NOT A GOOD WENDY OF CERTAINLY NOT. GONNA QUIT. AT WHAT YOU HAD. FOLKS I DON'T THINK THEY'VE- THAT THERE'S. I WAS WITH. IT WITHOUT SOME OF. WANTED TO ALSO ABOUT. I CAN HELP YOU OUT. YOU EMAIL WILL BE SENT TO IT YEAH. I FOR. A LITTLE. YEAH AND- SOME TIME. GUYS CHIRLA I'M NOT. DOT ABOUT. DETAILS OF THIS. I SURE TRYING TO SOLVE. CENTER EYES OF SENATOR- ALLEN AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS SENATOR HERTZBERG- I HOPE THE IT THE IS. A LIVE IN LOS WITH THEIR MEN MANY. OF THE CITY THE COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE. WILL DE OR NOT THE- AREAS FOR STREETS. BUT IT'S THEIR ONLY. OF YEAH THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW CREAM ON THE TOP HERE THIS IS THEIR ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE. AND THEY MANY OF THEM AS YOU KNOW CENTER ALAN MANY OF THEM ARE IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE NOT NOT ELIGIBLE WE HAVE LAWS THAT WE HAVE PASSED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT MAKES THEM INELIGIBLE FOR MOST OF. THE SAFETY NET THAT OTHERS HAVE AND AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME ESPECIALLY IN THE PANDEMIC SO. SO THAT'S THE REALITY THAT YOU AND I AND EVERYBODY ARE FACING- I DO KNOW THOUGH THAT THIS IS THE WRONG DIRECTION IN MY OPINION BECAUSE I YOU KNOW JUST THIS MORNING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR BILLS ON THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY THAT SHOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO DEAL WITH- IS NOT SUCCEEDING BECAUSE OF ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS. THAT THE SOLUTION THAT THEY ARE BEING PROPOSED ARE NOT COULD FIND THOSE LISTED BUSINESSES IT'S TO GIVE A BIGGER TAX BREAKS IT'S TO CUT DOWN ON THE TAXES IT'S IT IS NOT LET'S PENALIZE THEM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK. OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE MY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ARE. ADMINISTRATIVE FEES CRIMINAL FEES COURT FEES WERE ELIMINATING THEM BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TOO POOR THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO THEY JUST CAN'T. SO I JUST ASK YOU TO USE THAT AS THE STARTING POINT I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT OUR POOR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO AND SO WE HAVE GOT TO DIG IN AND FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER TO GET THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS OF. THE- SERVES SOLACE AS BE NICE SEVENTY TWO ON A CO AUTHOR IT'S A LATINO CAUCUS PRIORITY I DON'T KNOW FROM HER POINT OF VIEW EXACTLY WHERE- YOUR YOUR BILL WOULD END UP BUT IT'S CERTAINLY. DIGGING IN. NOT COMING UP WITH SOMETHING IS GONNA FURTHER PENALIZED FURTHER- IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PICK UP YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE FINES ANYWAY SO IT DOES NOT GET TO WORK THE SOLUTION THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SO. I CAN'T SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FURTHER IMPOVERISH PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY LOOKING TO MAKE A LIST. AND WE HAVE TO FIND A MORE OF A DIFFERENT ANSWER TO THIS- AND YOU COULD SEE THIS IS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. FOR THE FOR THE MOST PART I KNOW THAT THEY WERE ALL CALLERS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE OTHERS WHO TRIED TO COME IN. AND IT DOES CREATE THIS- OF THIS PROBLEM. BUT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT DIRECT AND HAVE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS MORE SPECIFIC. THAT'S WHAT CENTER GONZALEZ BILL IS IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC BILL THAT'S NOT LOOKING TO PENALIZE MORE BUT IS LOOKING TO FIX THE ISSUES- SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD URGE YOU URGE YOU TO DO. WHAT IF I MAY VENTURE I MEAN IT. YEAH SENATOR IF I CAN WE GET THROUGH ALL THE COMMENTS AND THEN ALLOW YOU THE TIME TO CLOSE- I'M TRYING TO IT WE NEED TO FINISH IN THIS ROOM AND I'M- AGAINST ALL ODDS TRYING TO GET THIS FINISHED UP. SENATOR WIENER WANTED TO SPEAK INSERTED SENATORS OKAY. HI FEDERAL AND I WOULD NORMALLY PASS BUT THIS FOR THIS A KNOWN THIS IS IMPORTANT AND I AND I AGREE I'M FROM A LINE OF A LOT OF WITH CENTER HEARD WAS SAYING AND I AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT CENTER TO ROSS SO- WAS SAYING- THAT I SUPPORTED WHOLEHEARTEDLY OF- PART OF LARA'S BUILD I'M FORTY SIX AND I SUPPORTED- CENTER SALAS- NOT CONTINUE TO DO SO- AND I THINK- BUT- MUCH AS I. HAVE SOME OF SUPPORTING TO SUPPORT THOSE THOSE EFFORTS I THINK THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT SOME CITIES ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND ARE TELLING US THAT THEY DON'T. TO PASS- AND I THINK IT'S AND FOR US TO SAY. NO AND I THINK I'M GONNA MOVING THIS OUT OF. TO A BE ON A- THERE THE FIND THE BILL MAKES YOUNG. AND YOU AND I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I'VE ALSO BEEN VERY ALIGNED WITH THE WORKERS CENTER HERTZBERG AND OTHERS. TO TRY TO GET RID OF A LOT OF THE FINES. ON THE IT DOES MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND I'M HOPING THAT THERE CAN BE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR. THAT YOU ARE OPEN TO DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME OF THE- OPPONENTS. OF THE BILL WITH MY NORMALLY MALIGNED AND WORK CLOSELY AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT. THAT IT THAT. THAT IF PEOPLE WANT TO SAY NO THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT BUT JUST ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER- OTHER OPTIONS ARE NOT PREPARED TO TRY TO. KILL THIS BILL IN ITS FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK YOU ARE TRYING TO RESPOND. TO A REAL ISSUE AND YOU'RE TAKING A GOOD FIT STOP EVEN THOUGH I'LL BE HONEST THIS PARTICULAR POST NO DOES. MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE AND I IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WOULD NORMALLY SUPPORT BUT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY. TO CONTINUE IN THAT GOOD FAITH EFFORTS ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ENGAGE WITH THE OPPONENTS. WITH WITH COMMUNITIES DURING. IN THE CITIES. OF THE CITIES BUT SOME OF THE GROUPS WHO ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND- COMMENTS TO TRY TO. INDUCE MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS- BUT I WILL- MOVE THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY AND I DO APPRECIATE. OUR WORK. SO I MIGHT. I'M JUST GONNA DIE- WITH ALL THE EVERYTHING THAT'S VINCE BE FOR THE EXACT REASON- THE SENATOR AND I. STRUCK OVER THIS. BECAUSE I SUPPORTED- THE ORIGINAL LOT OF BELL I'M 1100% AND- IN MY COMMUNITY WE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. AND THE COMMUNITY THAT REPRESENT WOULD BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO- ALLOW VENDING AND TO PROTECT THE BUSINESS. ENVIRONMENT AS WELL BUT WE DON'T HAVE. MAJOR TOURIST ATTRACTIONS. AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE SPOKE WITH. WERE MANAGING TRYING TO MANAGE. BIG TOURIST ATTRACTIONS WITH- WITH AT SOME CONDUCT IT'S PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS FROM I'M SURE THE VENDORS THAT WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM RIGHT- DISPOSAL OF FOOD ISSUE DISPOSAL OF- FUEL ISSUES- BLOCKING SIDEWALKS INCLUDING BLOCKING EMERGENCY ACCESS I'M JUST SOME SOME SOME THINGS THAT ARE VERY SERIOUS AND THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY SO- I CENTER I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA WORK ON THIS CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT- AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH EVERYBODY. BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE WHAT WE WANT OUR VENDORS TO BE ABLE TO SELL NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TO. BE ABLE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS RULES AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT THERE'S AMENDMENTS IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS CITIES AND THE VENUES. TO TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHERE IT IS THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN BEND AND HOW HOW YOU CAN BE YOUR SET UP AND I THINK THE LICENSE THE LICENSING. OR THE- ABILITY TO GET PUBLIC HEALTH- LICENSES TO SELL FOOD IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THAT- I. CENTER GONZALEZ'S BILL SOUGHT APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE- I. IT'S NOT DONE YET BUT I MINUTES I AM GOODNESS FORTY TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION SO SENATOR YOU MAY CONCLUDE. I ACTUALLY DID WE GET A MOTION ON THIS. I NEED A MOTION DOT. I NEED A MOTION- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BY FIRST AMEND IN REVERSE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR YOU MAY CONCLUDE YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THIS QUESTION THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE WHO CALLED IN. TO PARTICIPATE- ZERO THIS IS A THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE WE'RE FACING HERE AND IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS YOU'LL SEE THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD THAT THIS BILL IS ENGAGED IN. I'M SENATORS OFFICES BILL AND IS SEEKING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GET PERMITS. OUT WHICH IS A CONCEPT THAT I THROUGH THE ETHICALLY INDOORS IN FACT ORIGINALLY IDEA WAS THAT YES WE SHOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO PERMITS. AND OUT FOR THAT SMALL PORTION THAT THAT THE THAT JUST REFUSES TO COMPLY. ON REPEATED LOOK BASED ON A REPEATED BASIS THERE HAS TO BE SOME FORM OF ACCOUNTABILITY. I'M HERE IF IT'S NOT FIND LET'S THE OF WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE WE WE'VE TRIED A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT. I WE RUN UP FLAGPOLE THE CHALLENGE WE RUN INTO QUITE FRANKLY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN IN OUR IN OUR VERY RESPECTFUL AND CORDIAL CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE OPPOSITION WE STARTED EVEN A YEAR AGO. R. AS BY THE END OF THE DAY THEY JUST THE THEY'RE JUST I THINK PHILOSOPHICALLY OPPOSED. TO ANY TOOL. AREN'T THAT THE CITY COULD UTILIZE THAT WILL WILL ULTIMATELY HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE AT THAT SMALL PORTION OF POPULATION. THAT SIR. YEAH SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE I'M RUNNING INTO HERE. AND YEAH WE GOT THAT LIKE THE ISSUE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED. OF THE THAT IT FACES ARE VENDORS WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY AND AT THE ARE AMONG OUR MOST VULNERABLE. IS VERY REAL AND THE ISSUES THAT IS EXISTING AND THESE. ARE DESTINATIONS IS VERY REAL AS WELL I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THAT ISSUE ADDRESSED IF THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY LET'S FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY- BUT IT'S A REAL PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS.
