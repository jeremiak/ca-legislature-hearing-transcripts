00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.463
THE TRAGIC INCREASE IN SCHOOL

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.232
SHOOTINGS ON CAMPUSES. EVERY

AFTERNOON. SINCE NINETEEN

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.880
SEVENTY THERE BEEN A HUNDRED

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.114
SIXTY FOUR SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:39.152
CALIFORNIA. HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.653
AND I'M HOPING THAT WE SEE IN

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.156
OUR LAST ONE. BUT IT'S BEEN SAID

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:44.591
THAT HOPE ISN'T A STRATEGY. IN

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:47.193
THIS CASE HOPE ISN'T A STRATEGY.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.395
WE MUST DO MORE TO PROTECT OUR

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:50.997
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ON OUR

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.231
SCHOOL SITES. WELL CALIFORNIA'S

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.733
ADOPTED STRONG FIREARMS STORAGE

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.837
SAFETY LAWS IN APPROXIMATELY 68%

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.272
60% OF FIREARM RELATED INCIDENTS

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.274
AT SCHOOLS THE FIREARM WAS TAKEN

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.710
FROM THE STUDENTS HOME FRIEND OR

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.111
RELATIVE. MANY PARENTS ALSO

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.312
WRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THEIR

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.246
CHILDREN DO NOT KNOW THE

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:09.215
LOCATION OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.784
FIREARMS CHILDREN OUT. IN

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:14.153
NINETEEN SB NINE OH SIX WILL

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.421
REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.756
HOUSEHOLD FIREARMS AND INCLUDE

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.257
INFORMATION ON SAFE FIREARM

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.759
STORAGE LAWS. THESE MEASURES

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.227
WILL INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:22.762
AWARENESS OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.530
TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.432
NUMBER ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM IS

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.167
THE DISREGARD OF WARNING SIGNS

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:30.136
BEFORE AN INCIDENT AS WE'VE SEEN

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.205
RECENTLY IN THE TRAGEDY IN

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.273
MICHIGAN. IN ALMOST EVERY CASE

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.010
OF A SCHOOL SHOOTING THERE WAS A

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.044
CLEAR WARNING SIGNS. RESEARCH

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.580
SHOWS THAT KNOWING THE SIGNS OF

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:43.082
GUN VIOLENCE CAN PREVENT IT. IN

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.450
93% OF INCIDENTS SCHOOL SHOOTERS

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:46.786
PLAN THEIR ATTACK IN ADVANCE.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:47.954
MOST MADE THREATENING OR

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:49.122
CONCERNING COMMUNICATIONS TO

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.924
PARENTS FRIENDS OR EDUCATORS.

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:53.760
LET'S BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT TALKING

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.895
ABOUT AN ROTC CLASS WE'RE NOT

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.798
TALKING ABOUT A GAMER. WE'RE NOT

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:00.233
TALKING ABOUT ITER CHECK IDLE

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.368
CHATTER. WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.604
ABOUT IS A CREDIBLE THREAT. THIS

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:05.204
BILL WILL AUTHORIZE CONCERNED

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:07.373
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO ACT ON

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.275
THESE CREDIBLE FIREARM THREATS

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:11.344
AND AGAIN LET'S BE CLEAR. WE'RE

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.347
NOT EXPANDING ANYBODY'S RIGHTS

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.249
OR PRIVILEGES WERE NOT GIVING

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:17.784
EXTRA SORRY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.186
THAT THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:21.821
AGAIN LET'S TAKE MICHIGAN FOR

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:24.057
EXAMPLE. THEY HAD THE AUTHORITY

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:26.092
TO INVESTIGATE THEY DIDN'T SAME

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.593
IN CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE THE

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.595
AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE WHAT

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.330
I'M SAYING IS THAT TO MAKE SURE

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.366
THAT THEY DO. THIS BILL WILL

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:36.102
AUTHORIZE AUTHORIZED. CONSIDERED

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.071
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO ACT ON

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.840
A CREDIBLE THREAT NOT GIVE THEM

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.175
EXTRA AUTHORITIES TO DO SO IT

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:45.078
JUST WILL AUTHORIZE THEM TO ACT

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.012
ON THOSE THREATS. PRIORITIZING

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.346
THE SAFETY OF STUDENTS BY

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.449
INCREASING TRANSPARENCY ENSURING

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:50.917
SAFE AT HOME FIREARM STORAGE AND

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.585
ALLOWING A PERCEIVED THREAT

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.720
THREAT TO BE PROPERLY

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:56.656
INVESTIGATED. IS CRUCIAL TO

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.024
LESSENING THE CHANCE OF TRAGEDY

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.193
LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR ON WHO WOULD

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.462
BE DOING THE INVESTIGATION WE'RE

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.529
NOT ASKING TEACHERS WE'RE NOT

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.564

PERSONNEL TO DO THEIR JOB WHEN

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.138
THEY RECEIVE A CREDIBLE THREAT

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.272
THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.440
LOTS OF FOLKS TO THE- WE'RE

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.675
GONNA FORCE TEACHERS TO GO

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.744

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:39.165
WORK WE'RE ASKING THE TRAINED

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:35.093
IS HERE- AND I JUST WANNA SHARE

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:39.063
THAT- SOMEBODY WHO IS- PERUT AND

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.299
ALSO- NO MY WIFE SAID ON THE

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:43.368
SCHOOL BOARD FOR A LONG TIME AND

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:44.669
IN KEEPING STUDENTS SAFE IS. IS

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.170
A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BUT I

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:48.306
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL- IN

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:51.709
ITS FORM IS GOING TO DO IT IT'S-

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.211
THE AUTHOR THINKS IT'S GOING TO

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:55.213
DO NUMBER ONE I THINK IT

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.183
INFRINGES ON- GUN OWNERS RIGHTS

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.318
WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS ON THE

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:04.155
BOOKS THAT ARE. WE ARE REQUIRED

00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:07.692
. SKEWS ME WE ARE REQUIRED TO-

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.961
HAVE THOSE IN THE SAFE OR

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:11.729
LOCKED- WE ARE FREE YOU'RE FULLY

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:13.598
BY A FIREARM IT IS REGISTERED WE

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.099
ARE FINGERPRINTED THERE'S A

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:16.734
BACKGROUND CHECK YEAH DONE IN

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:19.203
CALIFORNIA- SO THERE'S A LOT OF

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.972
ALREADY LAWS ON THE BOOKS ABOUT

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:23.308
PEOPLE KNOWING WHO HAS- FIREARMS

00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:24.776
BUT THIS WOULD- I THINK IT

00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:26.944
BRIDGE THE RIGHTS ON THE

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:27.712
STUDENTS AS WELL- I WANT TO

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.380
COMMEND THE AUTHOR LAST. AUG

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:31.716
AWESOME BILL THAT- I THOUGHT

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:33.685
WILL DO ACTUALLY MORE FOR-

00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:36.054
HELPING KEEPING STUDENTS SAFE IT

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.122
WAS THE BILL THAT- WE WOULD

00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:40.224
EDUCATE THE SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:45.196
THE- CAFETERIA WORKER. EVERYONE

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:48.132
THAT IS IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:49.834
THAT IS- DEALING WITH KIDS TO

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:51.769
IDENTIFY WHEN THERE'S MENTAL

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:54.272
HEALTH ISSUES. AND AND TO BE

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.907
ABLE TO SEE THAT THEY MAY NEED

00:32:55.973 --> 00:32:57.542
COUNSELING AND THAT I THINK THAT

00:32:57.608 --> 00:32:59.043
BILL WHICH I SAID HOLY SUPPORT

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.411
ELECTED I'M I'M REALLY SADDENED

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:02.880
TO SEE THAT IT IT GOT HUNG UP IN

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:04.082
THE ASSEMBLY AND GETTING GET OUT

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:05.383
AND GET SIGNED INTO LAW BECAUSE-

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.718
THAT BILL ACTUALLY. I BELIEVE

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:08.619
WOULD DO A LOT MORE THAN THIS

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.722
BILL AND SO- THIS BILL IS A LOT

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:12.724
OF WORK I THINK IT INFRINGES ON

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.927
THE RIGHTS OF- PARENTS AND

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:17.061
STUDENTS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:19.197
I'LL BE OPPOSING THE BILL TODAY.

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:20.998
THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY CENTER

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:26.270
CHAU BOOK. SO VERY INTERESTING

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:27.638
BECAUSE I'VE ALSO BEEN IN

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:29.107
SUPPORT OF YOUR PASSED BILLS

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:31.442
WITH WITH REGARDS TO OUR

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.010
BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND I THINK AS

00:33:33.077 --> 00:33:35.046
I'VE EXPRESSED IN PREVIOUS

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:39.083
COMMITTEES IS. THE ISSUE THAT WE

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.485
HAVE RIGHT NOW IS BEHAVIOR

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.320
HEALTH CONCERNS AND THAT'S WHY I

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:44.389
THINK WE'VE BEEN SUCH PARTNERS

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:47.992
ON ON LEGISLATION THAT. PROVIDES

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:51.262
RESOURCES- IN OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:54.966
ADDRESS THE ISSUE AT HAND BUT I-

00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:56.901
WAS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:57.902
LIKE TO LISTEN TO WITNESSES VERY

00:33:57.969 --> 00:33:59.637
CAREFULLY TO SEE WHAT SOME OF

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:01.339
THE CONCERNS ARE. AND I EAT I

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:03.141
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HOW YOU WOULD

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:06.644
RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT-

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:09.213
THIS BILL AND IN MIND YOU I

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.518
THINK THE TITLE IS VERY- WHAT'S

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:18.689
THE WORD- LET ME JUST GIVE YOU

00:34:18.756 --> 00:34:19.924
AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.325
ISSUES THAT IT DOES VIOLATE

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:24.262
VIOLATE- MANY OF THE AT

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:30.334
CONSTITUTIONAL- VOIGTS RIGHT BUT

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.103
- FIRST OF ALL I DON'T THINK IT

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.272
IT IT DOES IN THE SENSE THAT I

00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:37.074
AM COGNISANT OF THAT THE DOJ

00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:40.044
ALREADY HAS. 80% OF THE DATA ON-

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:42.079
GUN OWNERSHIP REGISTERED GUNS-

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:44.048
AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:45.116
AMENDMENTS THAT I'M PROPOSING TO

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.584
TAKE IS THAT WE NARROWED THE

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:47.518
REGISTRY PIECE BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:49.720
80% OF THAT INFORMATION ON THE

00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:53.024
SEARCH AND SEIZURE PIECE- WHICH-

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.561
I THINK. I WAS. SUBJECT TO SOME

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:58.062
OF THE PASSION WE'RE NOT

00:34:58.129 --> 00:34:59.430
CHANGING ANY OF THE LAWS ARE

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:00.565
RIGHT TO PRIVILEGES THAT SCHOOL

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:01.966
DISTRICTS HAVE TO SEARCH

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:03.334
PROPERTY SO WE'RE NOT EXPANDING

00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:05.203
THAT SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.003
ANY FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.340
THERE- AND SO I THINK WE'RE ON

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:10.441
SOLID CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS AND

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:13.077
AGAIN I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:15.446
AND- TRYING TO WORK WITH FOLKS

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:17.315
AS YOU HEARD EVEN SOME OF THE

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:18.716
OPPOSERS WERE IN MY OPINION

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.284
QUITE SORT OF SOFT IN SOME OF

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:21.352
THEIR OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:23.287
KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN GOOD

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:24.388
FAITH- WITH THEM TO TRY TO

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:25.556
ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. AND I

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:28.759
THINK IN THE END THAT THEY WERE

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.261
GOING TO ADDRESS ALL OF. SO I

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:31.128
THINK. EVERYBODY WAS SCHOOL

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:32.997
SAFETY AND IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.232
ESPECIALLY IN OUR SCHOOL

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.700
DISTRICT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE

00:35:35.766 --> 00:35:37.235
PROTOCOLS IN PLACE IF THERE WAS

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.470
ANY SORT OF THREAT IN THE SCHOOL

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:40.204
DISTRICT WHY IN CALIFORNIA WHY

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:41.439
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:44.041
PARTICULAR BILL IS NEEDED- EVEN

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:46.677
IN A MODIFIED. VERSION DO YOU

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:48.613
HAVE ANY DATA THAT SHOWS THAT

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.881
THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY NEEDED IN

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:51.816
CALIFORNIA THAT WE DO NOT HAVE

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:53.751
ALREADY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. WHAT

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.888
WE HAVE AS HUMAN NATURE- AND

00:35:56.954 --> 00:35:59.290
BEING AT. SCHOOL PARENT MYSELF

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:01.325
BEING A MEMBER OF MANY SCHOOL

00:36:01.392 --> 00:36:03.294
ORGANIZATIONS I'VE BEEN IN ROOMS

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:05.229
WHERE PARENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:07.298
SAID. WELL THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.400
IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:10.868
A PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY I

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:12.103
THINK THAT'S A NORMAL HUMAN

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:13.337
TRAIT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:15.406
SAY. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:16.741
ON OUR STREET OR WE DON'T HAVE

00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:18.409
THAT IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY AND

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.410
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THAT

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:20.978
HESITANCY THAT I UNDERSTAND AND

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:22.079
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:23.848
MICHIGAN. YOU KNOW YOU CAN

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:25.116
NEVER. YOU CAN NEVER PREDICT

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:26.717
WHEN YOU'VE PERFECTED SOMETHING.

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:28.519
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PREVENTED. DO

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:29.887
I BELIEVE THIS WILL PREVENT HIV

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:31.722
YES IF I DIDN'T I WOULDN'T

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.824
PROPOSE IT. AS A PARENT OR

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:35.159
LEGISLATOR I DON'T WANT TO READ

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:37.295
A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE. THAT HAS

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:38.362
DETAILS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:40.298
IN MICHIGAN. IS IT GONNA HAPPEN

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.599
TOMORROW I DON'T KNOW WILL

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:42.967
HAPPEN TEN YEARS FROM NOW I

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:45.102
DON'T KNOW. BUT THE POINT IS WE

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.404
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY. TO

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.906
TAKE PRUDENT STEPS. TO SAY TO

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:50.942
ADMINISTRATORS. WE WANT TO

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:52.710
LESSEN YOUR BURDEN. BY

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:53.844
COMPELLING YOU TO INVESTIGATE

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:55.212
ONLY WHEN THERE'S A CREDIBLE

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:56.447
THREAT AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:58.316
THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE MISS.

00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:59.584
INTERPRETING WE'RE NOT TALKING

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.319
ABOUT. IDLE CHATTER. WE'RE

00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:03.921
TALKING ABOUT THOSE THREATS THAT

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:05.990
WE KNOW TO BE REAL. THAT MIGHT

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:07.892
FOR SOMEBODY TO TAKE IN ACTION

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:08.793
BECAUSE IT WON'T HAPPEN

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.494
COMMUNITY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:13.798
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS- TO

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:14.799
THE CHAIR DO WE HAVE ANYBODY

00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:16.534
FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND-

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:17.735
THAT COULD ANSWER A QUESTION

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:20.638
WITH REGARDS TO. POLICY IN IN

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:23.174
ACTUALLY. PURSUING A POTENTIAL

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.078
THREAT AS I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:28.512
ANYONE HERE FROM NEOVIA SCHOOL

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:31.515
DISTRICTS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:32.984
VERY CLOSELY WITH ACCESS- AND

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.418
THEY'VE GIVEN US A NUMBER OF

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.153
THEIR CONCERNS AND I BELIEVE

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.090
WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS- I THINK

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:39.724
WE'RE GONNA ACT OF EVENTUALLY

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.426
ADDRESS ALL OF THEM- SO. YOU

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:44.929
KNOW THEY DIDN'T COME UP IN

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:45.663
OPPOSE IT TODAY AND SO I THINK

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:46.530
THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:48.432
WORKING IN GOOD FAITH I'M NOT

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:50.267
GONNA SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I'M

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:52.703
CONFIDENT

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.738
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AND I

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.139
BELIEVE- CHECKED WITH MY STAFF.

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:56.574
ACCESS CONCERNS WERE VERY

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.275
SIMILAR THE ONES EXPRESSED BY

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:00.077
RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHICH I KNOW

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:01.379
YOU REPRESENT YEAH AND THAT'S

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:02.713
YOU KNOW I HAVE A SCHOOL

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.348
DISTRICT IN MY THAT HAS

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:05.883
EXPRESSED CONCERNS AND I'M

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.418
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.186
NOT THIS BILL NEEDS A LITTLE

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:11.722
MORE TIME TO WORK WITH THAT-

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:12.456
THIS TIME AROUND OR SHOULD WE

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:15.092
COME BACK TO IT- MAYBE NEXT

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:16.694
YEAR- WITH SOME OF THE WORK

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.062
ALREADY IN PLACE BECAUSE I THINK

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.930
RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:20.598
HESITATION FROM MANY

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.667
STAKEHOLDERS WITH REGARD TO THE

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.702
LANGUAGE WITHOUT SEEING AND I

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:26.237
KNOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:28.272
THAT AND I'VE BEEN IN. YOU KNOW

THIS ISSUE IS SERIOUS ENOUGH

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.158
THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:24.094
HAVING DRILLS. FROM MASS

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:26.797
SHOOTINGS RIGHT TO EVEN MY OWN

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.432
CHILDREN WHO ATTEND SCHOOL AND

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.167
THAT HAS ACTUALLY AFFECT ON ALL

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:31.735
CHILDREN RIGHT- WE'VE ACTUALLY

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:33.504
IN THIS VERY COMMITTEE. FOR

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.372
BILLS AROUND- YOU KNOW HER AT

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:37.141
LEAST ONE BILL AROUND THIS ISSUE

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:39.643
AND DON'T WANT TO CONCERNS WAS

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.911
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM THAT

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:42.613
ACTUALLY CAN CAUSE CHILDREN WHO

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:45.149
HAVE TO GO THROUGH DRILLS WHERE

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:47.051
ESSENTIALLY- THE EXPECTATION IS

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:49.219
THAT SOMEONE'S. GOING TO SHOW UP

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:51.388
IN THEIR SCHOOL AND HARM THEM

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:54.124
WITH A GUN AND- THE IDEA THAT

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.727
CHILD HAS TO PREPARE FOR THAT.

00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:59.763
POSSIBILITY IT IS THIS IS NOT

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.599
GOOD FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SO-

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:03.534
I THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.669
WANT TO EXPAND AND YOU'VE BEEN A

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:07.004
CHAMPION OF EXPANDING MENTAL

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:09.473
HEALTH SERVICES AND- RESOURCES

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.341
FOR PEOPLE IN SCHOOL AND I KNOW

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.544
MANY OF US HAVE- BUT WE ALSO

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:14.478
NEED TO TRY TO GET. THE ROOT OF

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.480
SOME OF THIS RIGHT SO WHAT IS

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.514
CAUSING THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:18.649
DISTRESS INTO SO MANY DIFFERENT

00:45:18.715 --> 00:45:19.650
THINGS. THAT'S REALLY DOESN'T

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:22.553
HELP WHEN YOU. HAVE CHILDREN WHO

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.088
HAVE TO GO THROUGH DRILLS. AND

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:26.857
FRANKLY FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY-

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:29.259
SO- TO. IT FOR THE POSSIBILITY

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:31.028
OF SOMEONE TO SHOW UP WITH A-

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:33.063
WITH A WITH A GUN AND- CERTAINLY

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.998
THERE ARE MANY WEAPONS BUT- GUNS

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:37.000
ARE. PARTICULARLY DEADLY AND THE

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:39.703
DESIGN TO BE SO. AND SO THAT IS

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.840
A YELLOW RIBBONS- WE HAVE TO.

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.908
CONFRONT THAT AS WELL- THE FACT

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:46.844
THAT- IT'S ENOUGH OF A

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:50.080
POSSIBILITY THAT MANY SCHOOL

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:50.848
DISTRICTS FEEL COMPELLED. TO

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:53.450
ACTUALLY- PUT THEIR STUDENTS AND

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.452
STAFF. THROUGH THESE DRILLS.

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:56.987
THAT THAT THAT THE POSSIBILITY

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:58.355
OF AN EVENT LIKE THAT HAPPENING

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:00.124
IS SUFFICIET THAT THAT WOULD

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.558
HAPPEN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:04.394
DO THAT. SO YOU KNOW I THINK I

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:06.196
DO- AND I. THAT YOU KNOW. I

00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:08.198

WORK WITH THE- WITH THE I GUESS

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:17.174
THE OPPOSITION AND ALSO. PEOPLE

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.821
IT WAS THIS BILL THAT WAS THE

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:41.458
APPROACH THAT WAS BEING TAKEN-

TO FIND ESTABLISH OR SOMETHING

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:50.300

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.035

DISTRICTS OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES.

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:20.117
WHO WANT TO BE TASKED WITH

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:21.084
COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM

COMMITTEE BUT WE'RE VOTING ON

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.927
THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY. I

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.829
CANNOT SUPPORT A REQUIREMENT

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:33.330
THAT SCHOOLS INTERJECT

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.399
THEMSELVES INTO ISSUES. BEST

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:37.000

ENFORCEMENT. SCHOOLS ARE

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:41.138
STRETCHED THIN ON ON MANDATE

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.606
FROM US HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:43.907
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ARE STRESSED

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:45.575
OUT AND EXHAUSTED. THEY'RE JUST

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:47.711
TRYING TO HANG ON TO THE BEST

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:48.612
THEY CAN FOR OUR STUDENTS AND

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:50.680
THIS IS ONE MORE BURDEN. I

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:51.948
CANNOT SUPPORT A REQUIREMENT

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:53.550
THAT STUDENTS BE INVESTIGATED

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.118
FOR DISOBEDIENCE OF SCHOOL

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:57.354
RULES. WE HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:59.856
THAT OUR ZERO TOLERANCE APPROACH

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.892
HAS PERPETRATED. MORE LONG FIRST

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:03.960
FORSMAN AND LESS DISCRETION FOR

00:51:04.027 --> 00:51:05.862
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO KNOW THEIR

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:07.764
STUDENTS BEST CAN CONTRIBUTE TO

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:09.833
THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.001
WILL BE HEARING A BILL LATER

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:13.136
TODAY BY SENATOR BRADFORD THAT

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:14.438
REMOVES MANY REQUIREMENTS FOR

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:17.073
MANDATORY REPORTING TO LAW

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.008
ENFORCEMET WHILE LEAVING THAT

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:21.144
DISCRETION TO EACH SITUATION. WE

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:23.046
ALL WANT TO ENSURE SCHOOLS ARE

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.981
SAFE AND TO PREVENT HORRIFIC

00:51:25.048 --> 00:51:25.715
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THERE'S NO

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:27.551
QUESTION THERE. I BELIEVE A

00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:29.219
BETTER APPROACH IS BY ADDRESSING

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.387
STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND I

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:31.755
THINK YOU'VE HEARD THAT FROM

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:33.056
ALMOST ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.691
TODAY. YOU YOURSELF ARE CARRYING

00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:36.293
SEVERAL BILLS A MENTAL HEALTH

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:38.028
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW CRITICAL IT

00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:39.162
IS THAT WE HELP STUDENTS

00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:40.997
FAMILIES. AND SCHOOLS NAVIGATE

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:43.733
TRAUMA AND HARDSHIPS. WE SHOULD

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.101
PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE AND FUND

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:47.070
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SCHOOL

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:48.505
BASED HEALTH AND COMMUNITY

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:50.307
SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS STUDENTS

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:52.075
UNDERLYING NEEDS. AND TO ENSURE

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:54.344
SCHOOLS ARE SAFE WELCOMING AND

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:56.713
INCLUSIVE FOR ALL STUDENTS. THIS

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.215
IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE A

00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:00.617
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:02.452
THIS BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER I

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:04.054
WILL BE VOTING NOW. MISTER

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.090
PORTANTINO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:08.458
CLOSE PLEASE DO SO. I WOULD

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:15.432
THINK THAT. THANK YOU FOR THIS

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.133
ROBUST CONVERSATION- I

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.035
RESPECTFULLY ASK TO SEE IF THE

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:19.836
BILL COULD MOVE TODAY- AS YOU'VE

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:21.271
HEARD FROM A NUMBER THE

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:22.405
STAKEHOLDERS WE ARE WORKING IN

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:23.540
GOOD FAITH TO ADDRESS THEIR

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.041
CONCERNS I BELIEVE WE'LL GET

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.610
THERE I BELIEVE MUCH OF THE

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.512
STATE'S SOFT OPPOSITION WILL BE

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:31.581
RELIEVED- WHEN WE DO- TYPICALLY

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.083
DURING THE FIRST POLICY

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.618
COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:35.785
PRESENTED WITH AMENDMENTS TO

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:37.120
CONSIDER AND WE CONSIDER WHETHER

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:38.822
WE WANT TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:41.057
OR NOT I WAS HOPING TO HAVE THAT

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:41.858
WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN DEALING

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:43.760
INDIVIDUALLY WITH A LOT OF IT

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:47.063
THE INSTITUTIONS- AS MY

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:49.533
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID- NO ONE

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.568
WANTS TO READ ABOUT A TRAGEDY IN

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:53.169
THE PAPER. NOBODY WANTS TO. READ

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:54.304
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THOSE

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:55.539
FOLKS IN MICHIGAN OR THINKING

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.240
ABOUT TODAY'S THINKING IF I

00:52:57.307 --> 00:52:58.975
WOULD HAVE COULD WE HAVE SAVED A

00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:01.144
LIFE. WELL YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:02.746
SAVE A LIFE. BUT YOU KNOW DEEP

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:04.581
IN YOUR HEART THAT IF YOU DO

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:06.016
EVERYTHING YOU CAN. YOU WILL.

00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:07.551
AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.119
RESPECTFULLY ASK. TO HAVE THIS

00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:11.187
BILL MOVE TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:12.022
SO WE CAN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS

00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:13.323
WHICH ARE LEGITIMATE. AND WE

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.191
SAID ALL ALONG WE'RE HAPPY TO

WE LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE BIT IN

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:52.580
TERMS OF. WE DO HAVE THIS

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:53.714
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO

01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:55.116
DECIDE TO CHOOSE PUBLIC SERVICE

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:56.717
AND YOU KNOW WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:57.818
NOT JUST ABOUT BEING ELECTED

01:35:57.885 --> 01:36:00.621
OFFICIALS ALSO ABOUT SERVING AND

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:02.857
GOVERNMENT RIGHT. AND AND THEN

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:03.858
THERE'S DIFFERENT ROLES RIGHT

01:36:03.924 --> 01:36:05.593
AND CERTAINLY IF SOMEONE HAS

01:36:05.659 --> 01:36:06.794
RESPONSIBILITY OVER YOU KNOW

FORTH- AND- THE- WOULDN'T MEAN

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.633
HAVE TRANSPARENCY SO WE KNOW

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.201
THAT THEY'RE NOT SELF DEALING.

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:16.170
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- THEN

01:36:16.237 --> 01:36:17.104
THERE'S OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.372
PROBABLY NOT REALLY IN THAT

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:20.040
CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN THE

01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:21.675
QUESTION IS THAT. WHAT ARE WE

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:23.277
REALLY SERVING AT THAT POINT TO

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:25.179
RATE IF TO ACTUALLY. IDENTIFY

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:27.081
SPECIFIC PEOPLE NEAR PACIFIC

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:28.516
SALARIES RIGHT AND SO THEY'RE

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:30.718
NOT THAT KIND OF ROLE. AND SO I

01:36:30.784 --> 01:36:32.419
REALIZE THIS IS PERHAPS A LITTLE

01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:33.387
LARGER THAN THE SCOPE OF WHAT

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:35.656
THEY DID THAT BUT THIS BILL DOES

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:36.557
ADDRESS THAT FOR FIRST FOR

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:39.059
SCHOOL SO. AND AT MAYBE

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:40.661
REVISITING SOME ISSUES- WITH-

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.062
THE PRIOR. PRIOR LEGISLATION

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:43.564
BUT- YEAH I JUST WANNA BE A

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:45.065
LITTLE SENSITIVE TO THE FACT

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:46.567
THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE THE

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:52.206
FINANCIAL. INFORMATION IS. NOW.

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:52.673
CONSIDERED PRIVATE AND

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.141
CONFIDENTIAL. AND THEN SAYING

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:56.143
THE IF YOU. ARE SIDE TO ENGAGE

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:57.344
IN PUBLIC SERVICE BUT NOT HAVE

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:58.779
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC

01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:01.015
DOLLARS DIRECTLY. THAT YOU HAVE

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:02.583
TO GIVE UP THAT PRIVACY JUST FOR

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:04.218
SERVING JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:37:04.285 --> 01:37:05.953
WORKING IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:06.654
SOMETHING. I THINK YEAH I DON'T

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.988
DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM FROM

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:09.790
WORKING THERE AND YOU ONE COULD

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:11.425
ARGUE THAT MAYBE THAT'S NOT

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.626
ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM

01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:16.363
DOING SO- BUT- I DO I. I DO HAVE

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.732
SOME CONCERNS- THAT PERHAPS WE

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:20.267
CAN BE THOUGHT THROUGH- BUT

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:22.236
AGAIN I DO YOU KNOW THE

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:24.138
UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT THE IDEA

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:25.439
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:27.208
TRANSPARENCY TO WE CAN IDENTIFY.

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:29.310
A FRAUD OR A PEOPLE ARE SELF

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:30.377
DEALING AND I THINK THAT'S

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:33.781
REALLY IMPORTANT SO- SO DATS-

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.883
I'VE- HOPEFULLY UP WE CAN HAVE

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:37.284
SOME FURTHER DIALOGUES THE BILL

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.252

THE PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T KNOW

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:57.238
ABOUT IT. AND THEY DID IT IN A

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:58.405
WAY- BUT I BELIEVE WAS

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:00.040
UNDERHANDED AND THEY'VE SPIKED

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:02.943

01:38:59.533 --> 01:39:01.535
TITLE IS. AND WHAT IT PAYS AND

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:03.837
SOME PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:04.471
THE SPECTRUM ARE UNDERPAID. AND

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:05.439
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THOSE

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:07.241
FOLKS WHO. HAVE MET THOSE

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:08.776
CRITERIA CENTER UNDERPAID AS

SERVICE- BECAUSE IT'S A PASSION

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:17.985
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S-

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:19.887
OPPORTUNITY ON BOTH ENDS. OF

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:20.988

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:15.109
THESE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES.

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:15.809
IT'S FRUSTRATING WHEN THE

OR FAMILY HISTORY IS NOT

01:56:32.151 --> 01:56:33.953
INDICATED BECAUSE THAT. WOULD

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:36.823
ACTUALLY- THAT DOES ACTUALLY END

01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:38.124
UP POTENTIALLY EVEN CAUSING HARM

01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:39.625

02:29:32.596 --> 02:29:34.565
CONCERNS SENATOR DOLLY. WITH THE

02:29:34.632 --> 02:29:40.204
MANAGER SO I- FIVE THE ED IS SB

02:29:40.271 --> 02:29:42.139
I THINK BY FORTY THAT CREATED

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:43.974
THE ORIGINAL SO I MY QUESTION IS

02:29:44.041 --> 02:29:45.409
THAT. THERE'S A THERE'S A FINITE

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:47.011
AMOUNT OF CAL GRANTS THAT ARE

02:29:47.078 --> 02:29:50.081
AVAILABLE AND THE PREVIOUSLY

02:29:50.147 --> 02:29:52.950
JIM. LEGISLATION ALLOWED FOR- WE

02:29:53.017 --> 02:29:54.452
CALL DREAMERS THAT WERE IN THE

02:29:54.518 --> 02:29:56.320
PIPELINE COMING TO BE ABLE TO GO

02:29:56.387 --> 02:29:58.255
ON AND MAKE AN EXCESSIVE CAL

02:29:58.322 --> 02:30:01.225
pTHE CAL GRANT HAS BEEN

02:30:01.292 --> 02:30:03.094
OVERSUBSCRIBED IS NOT IT'S NOT.

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:04.495
WE GET SIX BUT- THERE'S NOT

02:30:04.562 --> 02:30:06.230
ENOUGH MONEY TO GO AROUND SO

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:08.265
WHAT WHAT HOW DO YOU SEE THIS

02:30:08.332 --> 02:30:09.300
PIECE OF LEGISLATION INTERACTING

02:30:09.367 --> 02:30:10.901
THAT AND ALLEVIATE THAT SAME

02:30:10.968 --> 02:30:12.470
PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:14.171
WE'RE ACTUALLY REDUCING THE-

02:30:14.238 --> 02:30:18.242
CRITERIA OF. OF TIME YOU HAVE TO

02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:20.711
BE IN THE- IN THE SCHOOL TO. BE

02:30:20.778 --> 02:30:22.246
ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE CALGARY

02:30:22.313 --> 02:30:23.547
REYES SO THE IDEA IS THAT THIS

02:30:23.614 --> 02:30:25.316
WOULD LIKELY INCREASE THE NUMBER

02:30:25.383 --> 02:30:27.418
OF STUDENTS WHO COULD QUALIFY-

02:30:27.485 --> 02:30:29.453
AND FOR THE CAL GRANT- THERE ARE

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:31.122
STILL CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS AND

02:30:31.188 --> 02:30:32.356
THAT'S BEEN OVER SUBSCRIBED AND

02:30:32.423 --> 02:30:33.557
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WILL

02:30:33.624 --> 02:30:35.993
CHANGE IT. WILL THIS CREATE MORE

02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:36.994
OF AN OVER SUBSCRIPTION I THINK

02:30:37.061 --> 02:30:38.396
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT WE

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:40.464
DECIDE TO DO WITH THE GAL GRANT

02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:41.499
I KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN

02:30:41.565 --> 02:30:42.299
MULTIPLE EFFORTS INCLUDING

02:30:42.366 --> 02:30:44.001
CURRENTLY. ON REVAMPING THE CAL

02:30:44.068 --> 02:30:45.603
GRANT- AND SO I'M GUESSING

02:30:45.669 --> 02:30:46.937
YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THAT THAT

02:30:47.004 --> 02:30:48.239
THOSE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS IN

02:30:48.305 --> 02:30:49.940
CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN BUT THIS

02:30:50.007 --> 02:30:51.308
DOES NOT ADDRESS THE CAL GRANT

02:30:51.375 --> 02:30:52.943
PIECE THAT THE SEPARATE PIECE.

02:30:53.010 --> 02:30:54.412

BUS RIDE. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:19.189
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY- I THINK

02:33:19.256 --> 02:33:22.159
WE ARE IN THE BOTTOM OF THOSE.

02:33:22.226 --> 02:33:24.061

TERMS OF PROVIDING-

02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:30.401
TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL NOW WHY

02:33:30.467 --> 02:33:34.838
IS THAT IMPORTANT- THE SURVEYS

02:33:34.905 --> 02:33:37.308
WE CALIFORNIA HAS A PRETTY HIGH

02:33:37.374 --> 02:33:41.111
ABSENTEEISM RATE FOR OUR- K.

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:42.580

02:33:42.646 --> 02:33:45.616
STUDENTS IN IN THE SURVEYS. OF

02:33:45.683 --> 02:33:47.184
WIRE THESE CHILDREN MISSING

02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:49.053
SCHOOL IT IS COME OUT AGAIN AND

02:33:49.119 --> 02:33:51.622
AGAIN FOR MANY OF THEM IT WAS

02:33:51.689 --> 02:33:52.690
LACK OF TRANSPORTATION. NOW WE

02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:54.658
KNOW THAT IF YOU MISS SCHOOL IN

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:57.027
THAT CRITICAL TIME PERIOD THOSE

02:33:57.094 --> 02:33:59.196
EARLY GRADES YOU FALL BEHIND. IN

02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:03.300
SCHOOL. AND SO IF WE CAN PROVIDE

02:34:03.367 --> 02:34:05.402
ANSWERED THAT ONE QUESTION BY

02:34:05.469 --> 02:34:07.938
PROVIDING SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION

02:34:08.005 --> 02:34:09.206
THEN WE'VE ADDRESSED A VERY

02:34:09.273 --> 02:34:12.109
IMPORTANT SCHOOL SUCCESS ISSUE.

02:34:12.176 --> 02:34:15.012
NOW IT WAS AFTER PROP THIRTEEN

02:34:15.079 --> 02:34:17.281
THAT CALIFORNIA REALLY REDUCE

02:34:17.348 --> 02:34:19.416
THE FUNDING TO SCHOOLS REGARDING

02:34:19.483 --> 02:34:22.586
TRANSPORTATION WHICH WE AT THAT

02:34:22.653 --> 02:34:23.687
POINT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN

02:34:23.754 --> 02:34:25.189
THERE IS SOME LOGIC BECAUSE WE

02:34:25.255 --> 02:34:26.490
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:28.592
STAYED IN THE CLASSROOM BUT

02:34:28.659 --> 02:34:29.627
WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION

02:34:29.693 --> 02:34:30.561
NOW WE'RE IN A HEALTHIER BUDGET

02:34:30.628 --> 02:34:33.097
SITUATION. AND THE WAY THE BILL

02:34:33.163 --> 02:34:35.032
IS CONSTRUCTED IT WOULD ALLOW

02:34:35.099 --> 02:34:37.401
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO UTILIZE

02:34:37.468 --> 02:34:40.137
PUBLIC TRANSIT PUBLIC TRANSIT IF

02:34:40.204 --> 02:34:41.872
IT IS AVAILABLE IN THAT AREA OR

02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:43.974
TO UTILIZE- CONTRACT SERVICES

02:34:44.041 --> 02:34:47.077
WITH OF COURSE A PROPERLY

02:34:47.144 --> 02:34:48.612
QUALIFIED DRIVERS SO THERE'S

02:34:48.679 --> 02:34:50.547
SOME FLEXIBILITY. AND I'M

02:34:50.614 --> 02:34:51.882
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES WHO

02:34:51.949 --> 02:34:54.084
WERE BRIEFED AMENDMENTS WHICH

02:34:54.151 --> 02:34:56.620
ARE TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:34:56.687 --> 02:35:00.924
SO THAT- WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT-

02:35:00.991 --> 02:35:02.326
PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS A FREE

02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:05.095
BUS RIDES BY TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY

02:35:05.162 --> 02:35:06.697
EIGHT AND THAT THE BROUGHT THE

02:35:06.764 --> 02:35:07.398
SMARTEST OF THAT IS A

02:35:07.464 --> 02:35:09.533
TECHNOLOGIST THAT. THERE'S A

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:12.436
VARIETY OF THINGS THAT COULD-

02:35:12.503 --> 02:35:14.438
MAKE THIS DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT

02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:16.073
RIGHT AWAY WHETHER IT'S THE

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.442
SUPPLY SHORTAGE AROUND- SCHOOL

02:35:18.509 --> 02:35:20.577
BUS AVAILABILITY OR- DRIVER

02:35:20.644 --> 02:35:22.279
SHORTAGES ARE VERY THINGS LIKE

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:24.448
THAT SO OF COURSE WE WANT TO

02:35:24.515 --> 02:35:27.051
ACHIEVE THIS WE DON'T WANT TO

02:35:27.117 --> 02:35:27.918
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR

02:35:27.985 --> 02:35:31.922
SCHOOLS. ON THE OTHER AMENDMENT

02:35:31.989 --> 02:35:33.090
IS TO- AT THE SAME TIME THAT

02:35:33.157 --> 02:35:34.358
WILL DELAY THE REQUIRED

02:35:34.425 --> 02:35:35.826
IMPLEMENTATION WE WOULD NOT

02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:38.028
PREVENT ANY OF THOSE SCHOOLS

02:35:38.095 --> 02:35:39.730

02:35:49.707 --> 02:35:51.442

03:24:42.937 --> 03:24:44.071
IS THERE OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT

03:24:44.138 --> 03:24:46.741
CLARIFICATION AND THEN THIS IS

03:24:46.807 --> 03:24:47.642
THE SECOND QUESTION I DO HAVE IS

03:24:47.708 --> 03:24:50.778
THAT- RELATED TO THE PROVISION-

03:24:50.845 --> 03:24:51.712
THAT YOU'RE REMOVING THE

03:24:51.779 --> 03:24:54.015
PROVISION RELATES TO WILLFUL

03:24:54.081 --> 03:24:54.982
DISTURBANCE OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL

03:24:55.049 --> 03:24:56.717
OR PUBLIC SCHOOL MEETING. AND TO

03:24:56.784 --> 03:24:59.887
FIND ASSOCIATED- A CERTAINLY

03:24:59.954 --> 03:25:02.456
UNDERSTAND PERHAPS WHY THIS

03:25:02.523 --> 03:25:04.158
MAKES SENSE TO REMOVE FOR

03:25:04.225 --> 03:25:08.496
STUDENTS- I GUESS THE QUESTION

03:25:08.562 --> 03:25:11.032
IS THAT- SOMEONE WHO IS NOT

03:25:11.098 --> 03:25:12.266
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCHOOL SHOWS

03:25:12.333 --> 03:25:14.635
UP IN THE SCHOOL OR AN ADULT WHO

03:25:14.702 --> 03:25:15.903
HOPEFULLY IS- WOULD HOPEFULLY

03:25:15.970 --> 03:25:18.105
HAVE EXERCISE BETTER JUDGMENT-

03:25:18.172 --> 03:25:21.075
SO NOT A PUPIL AT THE SCHOOL

03:25:21.142 --> 03:25:22.043
STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL- BEFORE

03:25:22.109 --> 03:25:24.345
WE'VE SEEN CASES OF TEACHERS AND

03:25:24.412 --> 03:25:26.013
OTHER SCHOOL PERSONNEL BEING

03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:28.015
HARASSED OR SOMETIMES EVEN

03:25:28.082 --> 03:25:30.251
ASSAULTED ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW THEY

03:25:30.317 --> 03:25:31.152
ACTUALLY COMMITTED SALT. THE

03:25:31.218 --> 03:25:33.020
OTHER LOTS OF PRACTICE IN THE

03:25:33.087 --> 03:25:34.722
PLACE- IS THERE A REASON WHY WE

03:25:34.789 --> 03:25:36.724
WOULD JUST SIMPLY REMOVE THIS

03:25:36.791 --> 03:25:38.559
FOR STUDENTS AND STILL KEEP IT

03:25:38.626 --> 03:25:39.460
IN PLACE PERHAPS FOR OTHER

03:25:39.527 --> 03:25:40.561
PEOPLE GIVEN THE FACT

03:25:40.628 --> 03:25:42.163
UNFORTUNATELY THESE INCIDENTS

03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:44.131
HAVE HAPPENED EVEN RECENTLY. I

03:25:44.198 --> 03:25:46.333
THAT'S AGOOD QUESTION AND OUR

03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:48.302
GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE SURE WE'VE

03:25:48.369 --> 03:25:49.603
SEEN EXAMPLES WHERE STUDENTS

03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:52.973
WERE KNOCKING ON DOORS AND

03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:53.774
REPORTED AND- TURNED OVER T

03:25:53.841 --> 03:25:55.876
POLICE. YES IF SOMEONE ON THE

03:25:55.943 --> 03:25:57.278
RISE COMES ON CAMPUS WE WOULD

03:25:57.344 --> 03:25:59.080
HOPE THAT. NOT ONLY TEACHERS BUT

03:25:59.146 --> 03:26:00.681
ANY RESPONSIBLE ADULT WOULD DO

03:26:00.748 --> 03:26:03.851
THE NECESSARY- NOTIFICATION TO.

03:26:03.918 --> 03:26:05.886

03:47:10.216 --> 03:47:13.052

AREN'T THINKING ABOUT THE

03:47:30.303 --> 03:47:31.537
DEVELOP OR AT LEAST WORKING THEM

03:47:31.604 --> 03:47:33.306
TO BE SURE THAT WHAT THEY'RE

03:47:33.373 --> 03:47:33.840
DOING IS DEVELOPMENTALLY

03:47:33.906 --> 03:47:36.075
APPROPRIATE SO I JUST WANNA BE

03:47:36.142 --> 03:47:37.310
SURE DOES THAT. THAT COULD LEVEL

03:47:37.377 --> 03:47:38.144
SUPERVISION- AT A REALIZE THAT

03:47:38.211 --> 03:47:39.912
DESPITE COULD ALSO APPLY TO THE

03:47:39.979 --> 03:47:41.314
PUBLIC SIDE WHICH WE ALREADY

03:47:41.381 --> 03:47:42.715
HAVE IN PLACE WHICH I UNDERSTAND

03:47:42.782 --> 03:47:43.716
ANALYSIS WE DON'T QUITE

03:47:43.783 --> 03:47:45.585
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CAME ABOUT

03:47:45.651 --> 03:47:46.853

REASON WE HAVE THESE STANDARDS

03:47:54.560 --> 03:47:56.262
IS ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:47:56.329 --> 03:47:58.731
CHILDREN WHO ARE PARTICIPATING.

03:47:58.798 --> 03:48:00.133

03:48:00.199 --> 03:48:03.069
THE APPROPRIATE- ACTIVITIES AND

03:48:03.136 --> 03:48:06.372
THAT- SINCE THE- SOME THE

03:48:06.439 --> 03:48:08.074
DEFICIT OTHER FOLKS AREN'T

03:48:08.141 --> 03:48:08.741
THAT'S NOT PART OF THEIR

03:48:08.808 --> 03:48:11.544
VALUATION- THAT- THAT. THE AT

03:48:11.611 --> 03:48:12.412
LEAST THE CHILD CARE CENTER

03:48:12.478 --> 03:48:14.347
STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BE SURE

03:48:14.414 --> 03:48:16.249
THAT THE ACTIVITIES THEY CHOSE

03:48:16.315 --> 03:48:18.251
TO DO THEM END UP WITH. ARE

03:48:18.317 --> 03:48:19.285
DEVELOPING A PROPERTY FOR THAT

03:48:19.352 --> 03:48:22.088
PARTICULAR AGE. SO HOPEFULLY YOU

03:48:22.155 --> 03:48:23.756
