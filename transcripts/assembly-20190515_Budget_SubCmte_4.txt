ADMINISTRATION'S MAYBE VISION PROPOSALS FOR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SCHOOL STARS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND WE'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER -- ONE FUTURE WORK. FUTURE WORK COMMISSION AND LET AGENCY OPERATIONS JUST. THE PROPOSAL. HELLO MADAM SECRETARY HELLO. I LIKE THE RING. I'M SORRY LIKE THE RING TO THAT. MATTER OF FACT. LET OF SECRETARY. FOR THE COMPLIMENT. I DON'T THINK I'M NOT GOING HEARINGS. THIS CAN ONLY GET BETTER I SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY I WANTED TO JUST TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES -- TO BECAUSE THIS ITEM IS ABOUT THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY VISION FOR THE WORK -- THE DEPARTMENTS AND DIVISIONS UNDER THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TOUCH THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES ON A DAILY BASIS. FOR THE LOWEST WAGE EARNERS IN THE STATE WE ENFORCE LABOR STANDARDS THAT PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM POVERTY. INJURY RETALIATION. FOR THOSE OUT OF A JOB WE PROVIDE UNEMPLOYMENT AND DISABILITY INSURANCE TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. AND TRAINING AND SKILLS BUILDING. FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES WE OVERSEE PUBLIC SECTOR LABOR RELATIONS. AND FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE AND FOR THE EMPLOYERS. WE PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR WORKER TRAINING. WE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. AND WE CONNECT JOB SEEKERS TO PROGRAMS APPRENTICESHIPS AVAILABLE IMPROPER CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AT EMPLOYERS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT INVESTING IN THEIR PEOPLE IS THE BEST INVESTMENT THEY CAN MAKE IN THEIR BUSINESS. AND WE ALSO PROVIDE LABOR MARKET DATA. THAT WE USED TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF OUR POLICIES AND PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. SO BECAUSE OF THIS WIDE REACH THE EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS INTERACTING WITH THE LABOR AGENCY AT ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS AND DIVISIONS. CAN DRAMATICALLY SHAPE THEIR VIEW OF GOVERNMENT. AND SO IT IS THE ROLE OF THE LABOR AGENCY AND MY JOB AS LABOR SECRETARY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK AT OUR OPERATIONAL. I'M FUNCTIONS THAT WE STREAMLINED TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. THAT WE ENGAGE IN PROACTIVE WORK IN ORDER -- TO INSURE THAT WE'RE DOING OUR JOBS WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. AND THAT OUR WORK IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PARTIES BOTH OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE PRIORITIES. ONE OF THEM IS THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION. ARE THERE ARE POSITIONS THAT WOULD HELP TO STOP THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION AND FUNDAMENTALLY THAT WORK IS TO ENSURE THAT. INNOVATION AND AUTOMATION ARE NOT ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH JOBS -- WORKPLACE STANDARDS AND A STRONG ECONOMY THAT LIFTS UP EVERY CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHAT WE'LL BE DOING IS LOOKING AT AT POLICIES ASSESSING OF PREDICTIVE -- MEASURES OF WHERE JOBS ARE GOING WHAT JOB WILL BE IMPACTED WHAT JOBS WE LOST AND WHAT WE CAN DO AS GOVERNMENT TO HELP -- TO TO INSURE THAT. AS THE STATE OF INNOVATION AS A STATE WORKPLACE JUSTICE WE ALIGN OUR OUR OUR VALUES IN CREATING A STRONG ECONOMY. UP WE ARE A PART OF LOOK AT THE OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS IS ALSO A WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO STREAMLINE TO MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE OUR SERVICES TO WORKERS WHO ARE SEEKING JOBS. AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR WORK FOR SERVICES ARE OF ARE ALIGNED THERE'S A COHERENT STRATEGY AND THAT -- THAT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A WAY TO PROVIDE OF A STREAMLINED USER FRIENDLY METHOD OF GETTING ACCESS TO WORK FOR WORK WORKFORCE BENEFITS. UP AND FINALLY OF OUR PROPOSAL ALSO SEEKS -- TO PUT POSITIONS IN THE LABOR AGENCY THAT WOULD LEAD THESE EFFORTS THE STRATEGIC PROACTIVE EFFORT -- TO TO TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES AND TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE OF OF THE RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE LABOR AGENCY. I I I CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BUT I'M GONNA STOP HERE AND SEE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FINANCE [inaudible] LL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAS ALAMO THE LA L. -- AS A SECRETARY TO MENTION THIS PROPOSAL IS IS SORT OF UP TO TWO PIECES ONE RELATED TO THE AGENCY STAFF POSITIONS IN THE OTHER RELATED TO THE THE COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF WORK. OUT REGARDING THE LATTER ON THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL INCLUDED A A SIMILAR IDEA. AT THE TIME CALLED THE THE WORK GROUP ON THE FUTURE OF WORK AS PART OF ACTUALLY -- ITEM FIVE OF THIS AGENDA THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDED WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. ON WHEN WE ORIGINALLY RECEIVED THE THE MAY REVISION WE WERE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE. TWO ARE SIMILARLY NAMED COMMISSIONS WERE SORT OF EXISTED AT THE SAME TIME AND WE FOLLOWED UP WITH WITH -- AGENCY STAFF AND CLARIFIED THAT THE WORK GROUPS OF THE JANUARY VERSION HAS EVOLVED INTO THIS PROPOSAL ON THAT'S OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A TO Z. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THAT DYNAMIC IN THAT PROCESS AND CLARIFY FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF BUT OTHERWISE -- REGARDING THAT THE NATURE OF THE COMMISSION OR THE AGENCY PROPOSAL WITH NO COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER SURE ANY QUESTIONS. FIRST I WANT TO JOIN THE CHAIR AND WELCOMING MADAM SECRETARY AND AGREE THAT IT DOES HAVE A NICE RING TO IT -- HAD A COUPLE OF JUST DAY QUESTIONS AROUND SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES AND WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT BE COVERING THROUGH THE COMMISSION -- NUMBER OF US HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC OF PORTABLE BENEFITS -- I ALSO COUPLE YEARS AGO HAD A BILL TRYING TO THINK THROUGH -- FAIR SCHEDULING POLICIES IN THE WORK FORCE GIVEN AUTOMATION AND TECHNOLOGY AND I'M ALSO CURIOUS ABOUT HOW YOUR THING ABOUT AROUND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT I'M ASSUMING THESE ARE TOPICS THAT YOU MAY BE COVERING BUT COULD USE IS GIVE US A SENSE OF THE THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION ARE YOU GONNA. LOOK AT SPECIFIC TOPICS LIKE THIS. TELL US WHAT WHAT THE COMMISSION GONNA DO THANK YOU SO MUCH SO OF THE BROADER ANSWER IS YES THOSE ARE -- THOSE AND OTHER ISSUES ON THE TABLE -- PART OF THE CHARGE OF THE COMMISSION IS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF WORK HOW WAS WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE AND WHAT KIND OF SOCIAL COMPACT DO WE WANT IN CALIFORNIA? TO INSURE THAT EVERYBODY SHARES IN THE PROSPERITY OF THE STATE -- AS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER NOTED THERE IS A HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR THERE'S A PROBLEM OF AFFORDABILITY AND THIS WILL RELATE TO MY COLLEAGUE -- CHAZ'S POINT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK WHICH IS THAT MORE MANY OF THE BROAD POLICY -- IDEAS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION UP. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A GOOD JOBS THAT IN THE COMMUNITY THE MOST AND SO -- ADDRESSING CLIMATE ADDRESSING THE HOUSING SHORTAGE ADDRESSING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION AND CLEAN WATER ACCESS ALL OF THESE ARE NOT POLICIES THAT EXIST IN A VACUUM THEY ARE OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. AND ENSURE MORE EQUITY AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS WHAT WILL THE JOBS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM THOSE -- THOSE EFFORTS LOOK LIKE AND THAT IS WITHIN THE VERY DEFINITION OF THE FUTURE OF WORK UP SO THE IDEA OF WHAT THE PORTABLE BENEFITS RIGHT THE IDEA -- OF OF OF SCHEDULING AND WORKPLACE FLEXIBILITY ALL OF THOSE ARE WITH IN THE REALM OF FUTURE OF WORK AND OUR GOAL IS TO BRING TOGETHER. PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS PEOPLE REPRESENT EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES TECH COMPANIES INNOVATORS DISRUPTORS VENTURE CAPITALISTS ACADEMICS AND RESEARCHERS TO TACKLE ALL OF THESE UP ALL OF THESE ISSUES. RIGHT WHAT CM DO A TIME FRAME FOR WHEN THE REPORT MIGHT BE FINISHED SO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF INCLUDES A FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY PROGRESS REPORT -- I BELIEVE THAT THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE BEYOND THAT AND WE'RE CURRENTLY PLANNING FOR AT LEAST ABOUT A YEAR -- OF OF OF WORK AND THEN ANOTHER YEAR OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA ROLL OUT -- AND ENGAGE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION AND THEN ONE OTHER SUBSTANTIVE -- AREA -- YOU MENTIONED INCOME INEQUALITY AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY IS CONCENTRATING WEALTH AND MAKING INCOME INEQUALITY FORMER EXACERBATED ARE YOU GONNA THINK ABOUT TAX POLICIES OR OTHER. IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FOR THE ECONOMY THAT COME OUT OF THE FACT THAT THE WORK FORCE HAS CHANGED. SO RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE MANY POSSIBILITIES AS TO WHAT THE WHAT THE POLICIES OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL COME FROM THE COMMISSION ARE AT ADDRESSING THAT FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF OF POVERTY JOB QUALITY AND HOW INNOVATION AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF NOT. JUST WORKERS BUT ALL PEOPLE CALIFORNIA IS A KEY PART OF THAT SO WE'RE GONNA BE OPEN -- TO TO ALL IT TOOK TO LOOK ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT ARE GENERATED BY THE CONVERSATION BY THE COMMISSION MEMBERS. AND ALSO LOOK FOR TO ENGAGING WITH YOU ALL AS OF LEGISLATORS ON ON ON ON WHAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND WHAT THEY COULD LOOK LIKE GREAT LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT PARTICULAR REPRESENTING A CITY THAT. REPRESENTS THAT TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION BUT ALSO VERY MUCH AS STOOD WITH WORKERS WE SORT OF REPRESENT THAT DICHOTOMY -- THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH AND LOOK FOR TO YOU THOMAS THE ANSWERS. Q. SEVEN THANK YOU JUST IRVINE AUTOMATION PART A LITTLE BIT -- OBVIOUSLY AUTOMATION OF A LOT AG IN MY DISTRICTS LOSING MORE MORE AUTOMATION'S BECAUSE THE COST OF LABOR. AND AND HOW DEEP YOU CAN GO INTO THAT BESIDES LABOR PART BECAUSE SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH -- SOME LOST CLIMATE CHANGE -- WE DO A LOT IN CALIFORNIA HERE. THAT. IS NOT DONE ELSEWHERE SO YOU LOOK AT OUR FOLKS ARE INVOLVED IN THE AG INDUSTRY. OTHER FEES ARE A LOT MORE HIGHER NOT BECAUSE OF LABOR BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S IT'S PESTICIDES OR FARM EQUIPMENT IMPLEMENTS SO HOW HOW DEEPLY GO TO THE AUTOMATION PIECE. SO MY HOPE IS -- AND THE PLAN IS TO ACTUALLY GO DEEPLY A KNIFE TO COME UP WITH MEANINGFUL PROPOSALS THAT THEN WE ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TURN INTO REALITY IMPLEMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE THESE THESE ARE NOT NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR NOT QUESTIONS THAT WERE ONLY ASKING CALIFORNIA BUT I DO THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF OUR STATE. BECAUSE OF THE TALENT POOL BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT OF EMPLOYERS. WHO ARE BOTH OF THE CUTTING EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND IT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE -- STRONG WORKPLACE STANDARDS ARE GOOD FOR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE THINGS I THINK THAT WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY ASK CALIFORNIA TO REALLY DIVE IN MORE DEEPLY AND NOT JUST QUIT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT BUT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY REALLY WORK. SO I I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BUTFOR INSTANCE IFFOR FOR FRUIT AND CITRUS IT'S A WORLDWIDE MARKET WOULD DEAL WITH A LOT OF CITRUS CONFIRMATION. OBVIOUSLY THE COST OF OF DOING BUSINESS IN ASIA IS MUCH CHEAPER. NOT JUST LABOR I'M TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF A I MEAN JUST TO REALLY GET A TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON THAT AND REALLY LOOK AT THAT AND THE SAME THING WITH STRAWBERRIES WE SEE A LOT OF STRAWBERRIES. THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH ARE PRESENT PLUS DRIVERS GOING HERE BUT ALSO A LOT GOING TO MEXICO SO THAT THE COSTS ARE MUCH DIFFERENT BUT YET. IT'S IT'S STILL WE'RE STILL DOING THE SAME ANIMAL SO I MEAN I WOULD HOPE THAT DIE WOULD BE VERY DEEP AND REALLY BECAUSE NO ONE YET HAS YET REALLY EXPORTED. AND WHAT THE TRUE IMPACT ISSUES ARE. SO THE ANSWER IS YES WE WANT EXPLORE THOSE AND THAT INDUSTRY -- IN PARTICULAR IS ONE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AS OF WILL SITTING AT THE CROSSROADS OF MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT IN THAT THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN OUR PROPOSAL THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA PAUSE BECAUSE WE HAVE MISTER LACKEY HERE'S WITH A QUORUM SO CAN WE HAVE -- ROLL CALL PLEASE TO STEPS QUORUM. COOPER HERE. TO HEAR LACKEY. THE VARIANCE IN WHAT.

THERE'S AN INTRAPARTY THAT WILL BE COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S OKAY THAT'S BUT THAT WE HAVE NOT INDICATED WHEN A FINAL REPORT WILL COME OUT OR WERE POTENTIALLY INTERIM INFORMATION -- AS WERE WORKING OUT WILL COME OUT BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE COMMISSION ITSELF IS A PUBLIC BODY SO WE DO ENCOURAGE. PARTICIPATION INVOLVEMENT -- AND ATTENDANCE BY ALL. INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AND MOVE THE PROPOSED FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION ALSO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS ON THE WORK FORCE [inaudible] BROADLY -- YES IN IN THE SENSE THAT -- WHAT I MENTIONED EARLIER RIGHT THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS OUR COMMITMENT -- TO POLICIES DO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS THE NEED TO TRAIN WORKERS FOR THOSE JOBS AS THE CHANGE AND THOSE ARE ALL ABSOLUTELY SQUARELY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE COMMISSION. AND WHERE THE SIX ONGOING POSITIONS NEEDED FOR THE LABOR AGENCY. SO THAT RELATES TO THE THE AT THE FUTURE OF WORK -- COMMISSION IS ONE ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL THE SECOND IS TO PROVIDE THE STAFFING AND THE LEADERSHIP. YET THE LABOR AGENCY TO FULFILL THE ORIGINAL GOAL OF THE LABOR AGENCY WHICH IS TO PROVIDE -- OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP A COHERENT STRATEGY ACROSS ALL THE DEPARTMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF THE BOARDS OF THE PANELS UNDER THE LABOR AGENCY. THANK YOU SOMEONE THINKING THAT VICTORY FOR COMMITTEE HEARING AND SPEAKING TO US -- REFER THE CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AND TAKE ACTION NEXT WEEK SOARING HOME THIS ITEM OPEN THANKS VERY MUCH I WILL CHAIR THANK YOU ABSOLUTE MEMBERS. THIS REMOVED ITEM NUMBER -- TWO PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT. YEAH I SEE THAT MISS WHICH HAS JOINED US GOOD AFTERNOON MR MEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG EDWARDS I'M CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL NATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL -- GENTLY EXPAND THE UNIT THAT WAS CREATED IN THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN TO REVIEW -- APART THE CLAIMS -- TO INSURE THAT -- THIS ACTIVITY WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY PRIOR TO THAT TIME. NOT MONITORED NOT REVIEW THESE ACTIONS ARE PRIVATE ACTIONS THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE EMPOWERED BY THE AT TO TO TAKE IN LIEU OF THE STATE. AND SO IT WAS AGENCIES -- AND THE DEPARTMENT'S DESIRE TO JUST -- TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE'S -- INTERESTS WERE WELL SERVED BY THIS PUZZLE THIS PROPOSAL WILL. ADD NINE POSITIONS AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS -- TO EXPAND THIS EFFORT AND MY COLLEAGUE WILL -- BRIEFLY KIND OF PROVIDE A BROAD OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL SPECIFICALLY IN COPLEY ACCOMPLISH AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. THANK YOU ON THE PARKING UNIT WAS STARTED A FEW YEARS AGO WITH THE IDEA OF PROVIDING SOME STATE OVERSIGHT TO THE PAGO PROCESS TO GET SOME IDEAS OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT. AND TO PROVIDE SOME OF OVER A FEW OF WHETHER IF THE SYSTEM WAS BEING ABUSED OR NOT. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OR WE HAVE ON DONE THAT WE HAVE DONE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS ONE THING IS THAT WE REVIEW PAGA NOTICES. THAT COME BEFORE ALL OF THE OLD W. T. H. O. TO REVIEW THEM TO SEE TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON ON THE SECOND THING THAT WE DO IS SOME OF THE A SUBSET OF THOSE CASES. BASED UPON OF THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR STAFFING AND THE PRIORITIES THAT WE GIVE TO CERTAIN TYPE OF CASES WE TAKE ON FOR INVESTIGATION. AS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING THOSE CASES TO GROUP BE PURSUED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR THROUGH THE BY THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. AND THEN THERE IS A THIRD OF A CATEGORY OF WORK THAT WE DO WHICH IS THAT WE REVIEW PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS. AND ALL OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS ARE WHERE PRIVATE. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S HAVE FILED ACTIONS IN SUPERIOR COURT. AND THOSE CASES ARE NOW BEFORE THE COURT FOR SETTLEMENT AUTHORIZATION WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE ACT. IN THOSE SITUATIONS OR WE LOOK AT THOSE TO GET SOME IDEA OF WHETHER ONE THE PENALTIES ARE BEING PAID TO THE STATE UNDER THE AGREEMENT -- APPEAR TO BE. ALL SUFFICIENT AND SECONDLY ALL WHETHER THE WORKERS WHO WERE AFFECTED BY THE VIOLATIONS ARE BEING APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATED. ON END IN THAT OTHER SAUCE. OF POLICIES ARE ARE BEING ENFORCED BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WHEN THEY PURSUE THESE MATTERS IN COURT ART AFFECT STEPPING INTO THE SHOES OF THE STATE. AND SO ALL THE UNIT WAS SET FOR TWO LAW TO TO MONITOR THOSE THINGS AND AND TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN TO PURSUE CERTAIN CASES. OF GRIEF WE THINK THAT THE UNIT HAS BEEN SIX THIS WILL IN DOING THAT -- THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL LARGE CASES OR WHICH THE UNIT PICKED UP OFF FOR INVESTIGATION AND HAS PER AND IS PURSUED ALL OF THOSE CASES ON THEIR VARIETY OF REASONS WHY. ARE WE THINK THAT THE STATE INTERVENTION IN THOSE CASES HAS BEEN ALL IMPORTANT. TO THE OVERALL ENFORCEMENT. ON THERE SOME THINGS THAT WEEK IS A STATE AGENCY ARE ABLE -- TO TO TO ENFORCE THE LAW WHICH PRIVATE PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO DO SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS REALLY NOTABLE. IS THAT THERE ARE CASES WHERE THE SITUATIONS WITH VERY SEVERE VIOLATIONS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THE STEP OF COORDINATING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN ACTUALLY GETTING PROSECUTION OF THOSE CASES. AND WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE CASES ALL THAT'S ALREADY GONE THROUGH WHERE THEY'RE AWFULLY PLEA BARGAIN WAS ENTERED BY THOSE ALL IN ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO BECAUSE THOSE VIOLATIONS. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE PURSUING THE ECONOMIC OF RESTITUTION FOR THE WORKERS MATTER FACT IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE THAT I'M REFERRING TO IS GOING FORWARD TODAY ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS FOR THE UNIT IS DOING THAT. ON BUT WHAT IT'S BECOME CLEAR OVER THE LAST. YOUR OR TWO IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE TO THIS IS. ALL COMMITTED TO THIS IS INSUFFICIENT TO HAVING A REASONABLE SAMPLE AT A REASONABLE INPUT INTO THE SYSTEM OVERALL. AND IT'S THOUGHT THAT ON BY ESSENTIALLY DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THAT UNIT WE CAN EXTEND THE SUCCESSES THAT THE UNIT IS HAD THOSE FOR ALL TO TWO MORE TO MORE SITUATIONS AND CONTINUE. TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THE SITUATION SUCH THAT THE ALL LAWS ARE BEING ENFORCED IN THE WORKERS OF WHO RELY ON US IN THOSE LAWS. ARE HAVING ARE GETTING REMEDIES AND GETTING RESTITUTION FOR THE WAGES THAT ARE OWED. UNDER THIS WE WOULD BE ADDING ON A COUPLE OF ATTORNEYS TO THE UNIT. ALSO OF THERE WOULD BE ON INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF INVESTIGATORS -- IN THE THE HOPE IS THAT WHILE WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE DOING FEW WERE REFUSE OF INCOMING PAGA NOTICES THAT THE REVIEW THAT THE WORK THAT WE WOULD BE DOING ON THOSE WOULD BE MARCH MORE THOROUGH. AND WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR FIRST FEW YEARS SO THAT'S BEEN THOROUGH UP TILL NOW. NO IT'S BEEN WELL IT'S IT'S BEEN THOROUGH FOR THE ONES THAT WE HAVE TAKEN ON AND SO ON WITH THE RESULT THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF REVIEWS -- THAT WE DO -- SO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHEN WE GET WE AND WE GET ABOUT APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED NEW PAGA CLAIMS BEING FILED EACH MONTH WITH THE LW DA -- IN WILL BE TO AS WE WE DO PROVIDE OF APPLY SOME ANALYTICS TO THAT TRYING TO FOCUS IN ON PRIORITY AREAS. SO NO FOR THE STATE FOR THE L. W. D. A. AND THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ON THE PRIORITY IS TO LOOK AT INDUSTRIES WHERE LOW WAGE WORKERS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED OF TO A LARGE EXTENT. THERE ARE MANY OTHER BLOG PAGA NOTICES TO COME IN FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES FOR EXAMPLE FINANCIAL SERVICES WITH RELATIVELY HIGH PAID INDIVIDUALS INSURANCE INDUSTRY THINGS LIKE THAT. IN THOSE INSTANCES IN OF THOSE CASES ARE BEING HANDLED CURRENTLY BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND ON THEY CAN DOG DO THAT. SUFFICIENTLY ON WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF THE LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES ON YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE SEE ON THE MOST ABUSE AND AND AND ONE OF FOCUS THE THE ATTENTION. WELL I AGREE WE NEED PREPARERS BUT IT'S TRUE THAT MOST OF THE MONEY GOES TO THE ATTORNEYS THESE CASES AND NOT THE WORKERS. WELL THAT. THAT GETS TO THIS THIS ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS WHICH IS OUR REVIEW OF THE SETTLEMENT SO IT IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT THE ALL THAT'S THE I I YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T HAVE. ALL THAT JUST FOR ANECDOTALLY IT APPEARS TO BE CORRECT IT IF IT APPEARS THAT IN MANY INSTANCES ON THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES. OUR OUR YOU KNOW PROPORTIONATELY OUTSIZED SO FOR OUT TO PROTECT THE WORKERS SHOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY THAT IS COLLECTED GO THE WORKERS AND NOT THE ATTORNEYS. OLD ABSOLUTELY. OKAY ABSOLUTELY HOW WE GO ABOUT FIXING THAT. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE ARE REVIEWING THOSE AND WHAT. AND WHAT WE HOPE TO DO WITH WITH PART OF THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING. IS TO BE INTERVENING IN COURT. TO LOG COMMENT EDWARD APPROPRIATE CHALLENGE ALL PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS IS BEING YOU KNOW OUT OF WHACK IN DOG IT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD. SEE OURSELVES DOING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF THE OF THE PROGRAM THERE'S BEEN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF ON ENGAGEMENT WITH WOMEN -- REVIEWING THAT THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A LIMITED NUMBER OF CASES WHICH WERE WHERE WE'VE ACTUALLY INTERVENED. ON TO COMMENT IN DAHLE PURSUE THAT WE WOULD SEE THAT UNDER THE PROPOSAL. BEING LARGELY INCREASED SO THAT WE WOULD BE COMMENTING ON APPROXIMATELY SIX CASES A YEAR IN COURT TRYING TO HAVE AN IMPACT THAT WAY. ONE LEGISLATURE'S ALWAYS BEEN. FOR THE WORKERS IN SOME LAWS BE PASSED MATURE LAWS. TO ENSURE WORKERS RIGHT SO. I DON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE IN THIS REPORT. AS FAR AS TRYING TO ADJUST THAT% TO MAKE SURE THOSE FUNDS GO THE WORKERS SO. IT BE GOOD TO SEE THAT AT SOME POINT REALLY IDENTIFIES THAT IS BEING IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE IN REVIEWING CASES WITH STAFF I MEAN IT'S IT'S GLARINGLY -- RELEVANT THAT AND NOT RELEVANT BUT IT'S IT'S JUST CLEARLY THAT -- EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES THE ONES THAT ARE COMING ON THE SHORT END OF THE STICK YOUR SITE WILL CITIES IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT WE DO. RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE WE JUST HAD A CASE IN SAN JOSE WITH RESTAURANT WORKERS. WARES SOMEHOW THIS EMPLOYER. DIDN'T KNOW THAT. HOURS PASSED THE THE DAY OR FORTY AND WE NEEDED TO BE PAID A TIME AND A HALF WE PICKED UP THAT CASE BECAUSE WE SAW WAS FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS WE WORKED THE CASE UP WE ENDED UP GETTING A RESOLUTION. OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON THAT CASE WHICH MORE THAN -- COMPENSATED THE WORKER FOR THE WORKERS FOR THE UNPAID WAGES. AND WHAT WE RECEIVED FOR THE STATE ON THAT CASE WAS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CIVIL PENALTIES. NO WE THINK THE OBVIOUSLY OUR FIRST GOAL IN THE WORK THAT WE DO. IS TO GET THE MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF THE WORKERS -- IN SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO OF WE WE WE TO THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS IN THEM WE WE LITIGATE THE CASES IF NEED BE TO GET THAT RESULTS SO BY BEING AGGRESSIVE WITH THAT WE THINK WE ARE ACCOMPLISHING. THE END THAT THE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF TRANSFERRING THAT SAME -- SAME PRIORITIES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT'S THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE CONCERTED WORK OVER THE NEXT YEARS IN PART OF IT IS BY EXAMPLE AND PART OF IT IS GONNA BE BY US BEING IN THE SUPERIOR COURT. AND REALLY YOU KNOW SAYING. GIVING OUR OPINION AS TO SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE DEFICIENT THAT NEED TO BE RE WORKING THEY NEED TO GO BACK AND DO MORE WORK ON IT AND AND GET THE WORKERS WHAT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU [inaudible] FINANCE. HI MARC MINUTES APART AND FINANCE JUST WANTED -- TO IF YOU KNOW EMPHASIZE THAT WE HAVE MUTUAL GOALS -- AWAY THIS PROPOSAL INTENDS TO DO IS -- ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE ON MORE CASES AND WHICH WOULD LEAD TO MORE FORSMAN OF LABOR LAWS AND THE BETTER RECOVERY WAGES FOR AFFECTED OF AFFECTED AFFECTED EMPLOYEES [inaudible] LL. THANK YOU I'M WITH REGARD TO THIS SPECIFIC BUDGET PROPOSAL IT'S A AT SOAP WORKLOAD AUGMENTATION -- WE'VE REVIEWED IT OBVIOUSLY THAT THE POCKET UNIT HAS HAD SOME FRUITFUL INVESTIGATIONS SENSE IN THE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WE SUSPECT THAT THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE WITH THE AUGMENTATIONS. OF COMMENTS SPECIFIC TO THAT ELEMENT ON YOUR COMMENTS THOUGH MISTER CHAIR I THINK DO RAISE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THE POLICY AROUND PAGA -- POLICY CHANGES WERE ENACTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO ON THIS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. TO PROVIDE THE AGENCY MORE OVERSIGHT OVER THESE PRIVATE LEGAL ACTIONS ON ONE BY PRODUCT OR BENEFIT OF THIS AUGMENTATION MIGHT BE THAT THE LEGISLATURE OUR OFFICE AS WELL AS A LABOR AGENCY. LEARNS MORE ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE ON THE THE PRIVATE LEGAL SIDE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT. WEATHERED CHANGES OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS OVERSIGHT ROLE ON ARE APPROPRIATE FUTURE CHAIR THE CHAIRS COMMITTEE HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN THAT AND SEEING THAT GOING FORWARD SO. LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE TWO OF YOU ON THIS ISSUE THANK. A QUESTION COMMITTEE. I WENT UP A PUBLIC COMING ON THIS ITEM [inaudible] NOTION SPEAK. JUST ONE MORE QUESTION WHAT IS A MAYBE VISION PROPOSED SHIFTING OVERSIGHT FROM PAGA UNIT TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE TWENTY SIXTEEN PROPOSAL ESTABLISHED -- A POSITION IN THE LABOR I MEAN SORRY IN THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY -- TO PROVIDE A GENERAL OVERSIGHT AND POLICY DIRECTION THAT POSITION REMAINS THAT HAS NOT CHANGED WHAT WE ARE STREAMLINING. THIS PROPOSAL IS THE DAY TO DAY OVERSIGHT IN MANAGEMENT OF THE STAFF AFFECTED LEE ENGAGED IN THE NOTICE REVIEW IN THE INVESTIGATION IN THE SETTLEMENT REVIEW SO AGENCY OVERSIGHT REMAINS. OF THE HOPE IS THAT IS THAT THIS ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE WILL HELP US STREAMLINED THE DAY TO DAY MANAGEMENT OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU ISRAEL THIS ITEM OPEN -- SOLANO NEXT AUTUMN. ISSUE NUMBER THREE GENERAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO HARMONIZE -- TWO SEPARATE PIECES OF LEGISLATION. THAT WILL PASS A. B. -- NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WAS PASSED IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN IN A. B. -- I'M SORRY SB -- THIRTEEN FORTY THREE WAS PASSED A TWO YEARS LATER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THOSE SEPARATE PIECES OF LEVEL THE LEGISLATION BOTH REQUIRE REPORTING FROM THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY -- V. REPORTING REQUIRED WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT UNDER EACH OF BILL AND SO THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO HARMONIZE THOSE DIFFERENCES STREAMLINED THAT REPORTING -- AND ACCOMPLISH THE THE NATIONAL -- INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE -- AND THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. THANK YOU SORT OF STOPPER SECOND BECAUSE WE HAVE -- MISTER THERE IN THIS WEEK'S HERE MARIN GO FOR THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR.

OKAY -- GOING CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT ALL THIS ITEM OPEN -- I SHOULD NEVER FOR EMPLOYMENT BUILDING APARTMENT MAYBE VISION PROPOSALS GOOD AFTERNOON TO SEVEN MEMBERS -- PATRON WITH EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT -- WITH SEVERAL ITEMS IN FRONT OF YOU THE CLAIMANTS PRIVACY MEASURE WHICH IS AN EXACT WHICH IS THE RESULT OF THESE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S. REVIEW OF OUR DOCUMENTS AND TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR SYSTEMS. BENEFITS SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION WAS A CONTINUATION. OF A PROJECT TO HELP MODERNIZE MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. A BENEFITS IN THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA'S ARE ACCUSTOMED. TO INTERACTING WITH -- NOT ONLY STATE AGENCIES BUT ALSO -- AS THE REST OF THE BUT CITIES AND COUNTIES UP TO PROVIDE BENEFITS. THE CONTINUATION OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT. THAT THE PAID FAMILY BENEFIT -- AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SERVE IT WE FOUND THAT THROUGH. A STUDY AND ALSO LOOKING AT SOME OF OUR OTHER STATES THAT HAVE BEEN PARKED UPON. PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAMS THAT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT BENEFIT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND WHAT EXACTLY IT IS IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT -- WE ALSO HAVE -- SOME PROGRAMMING REGARDING THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE MILITARY EXIGENCY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BENEFITS. FOR OF OUR MILITARY FAMILIES AS THEY A DEAL WITH BEING SENT OFF. TO FIGHT. AS WELL AS TO JUST SOME ADJUSTMENTS. MAY TWO WILL FUNDS [inaudible] FINANCE [inaudible] COMMENT LL. THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS IN IN THIS ITEM AND ALL -- FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE THE BCP RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO THE LENGTHENING OF THE PAID FAMILY PROGRAM AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FROM. SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS -- THE GOVERNOR NOTES THAT THIS EXPANSION -- WILL REQUIRE SOME TECHNOLOGY CHANGES ON AND AS PART OF THE TRAILER BILL THAT PUTS INTO PLACE THE EXPANSION THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TO EXEMPT. THIS TECHNOLOGY PROJECT FROM THE STATE'S PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE. PROCESS WHICH IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S -- I. T. OVERSIGHT PROCESS I IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US AT THIS POINT WHY THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT -- WOULD BE EXEMPTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION FROM ITS OWN IT OVERSIGHT PROCESS. ON WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS CONCERN WITH EDT AND THEY POINTED OUT TO US ON THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST IN THEIR VIEW THIS SYSTEM CHANGES RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND THEREFORE ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT CARRIES PRETTY LOW RISK GOING FROM SIX WEEKS. TO EIGHT WEEKS ON AND ALSO THE THE INFLAMMATION IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINES RATHER TIGHT -- THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO GO TO EIGHT WEEKS BY JULY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR AND SO MINDFUL OF THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS -- BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THAT THE PROCESS. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE OF TIMELINESS AND MEETING THAT IMPLEMENTATION DATE I'M WE THINK THERE ARE SOME TRADE OFFS WITH THIS APPROACH OBVIOUSLY ON THAT THE POWER PROCESS OF THE PROJECT PROVE A LIFECYCLE PROCESS. HELPS ENSURE THAT IT SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL -- SO WITHOUT IT THERE SOME REST THERE -- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SOME OF THOSE INSURANCES DO TAKES MORE TIME -- AND SO THE QUESTION BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR EXEMPTION OUT RELATES TO THAT TRADE OFF ABOUT HITTING THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR JULY ONE OF NEXT YEAR.

ISSUE NUMBER [inaudible] FIFTEEN THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM REQUESTING FROM MY OFFICE SPECIFICALLY I'M REQUESTING AN INCREASE FOR GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION BY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. ALONG WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE TO A RE ENFORCEMENT ALLOCATION. THE SHIP WILL ASSIST THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE WITH ITS EFFORT TO APPROPRIATELY REALIGN. FUNDING BASED ON WORKLOAD GOVERNMENT CODE AND BEST PRACTICES. FURTHERMORE THIS REALIGNMENT WILL ALLOW THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO REDUCE ITS DEPENDENCE ON REIMBURSEMENTS THUS REDUCING -- MY OFFICES RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CURRENT UNSUSTAINABLE FUNDING STRUCTURE. WE JUST CAME FROM THE SENATE WHERE THEY APPROVED AS BUDGETED WITH THE ADDITION OF BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ASKING MY OFFICE TO REPORT NEXT YEAR. ON THE OFFICES OVERALL RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY RECENT WERE PENDING CHANGES IN RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS THE IMPACT DUE TO THE LOSS OF THE WAKE. WORKLOAD I HOPE THIS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS OF YOUR STAFF NOTED IN THE STAFF COMMENTS AND I AM AMENABLE TO INCLUDING IT [inaudible] FINANCE. GOING TO GET OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE FEEL PERMANENT FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE PROBLEM THE TRANSIT OFFICES FACING. THIS FUNDING REALIGNMENT ROLL RIGHT SIZE IT'S FUNDING STRUCTURE TO BETTER REFLECT ITS CURRENT BUSINESS NEEDS HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN BROWN WITH THE LA OKAY -- WE THINK THAT THE TREASURE IN INTEREST IN RIGHT SIDE IN. THE OFFICE OF BUDGET COULD COULD VERY WELL MAKE SENSE I THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT IT'S A VERY TECHNICALLY COMPLEX. A PROPOSAL IN ONE THAT'S BACKED BY A CONSULTANT REPORT THAT'S QUITE LENGTHY WE'VE ONLY JUST STARTED TO REVIEW A IN SO. OUR THOUGHT IS THAT GIVEN THAT COMPLEXITY. ONE THING THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THE PROVING THE PROPOSAL ON A ONE YEAR BASIS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE OFFICE. TO MOVE FORWARD AS PLAN WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE ANY OTHER PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES AND INTENTIONALLY AND THEN -- WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO GET A NEW PROPOSAL IN JANUARY WHAT WHERE WE'D HAVE MORE TIME TO REVIEW IT AND THEN REPORT BACK TO YOU. GIVE ME MORE INFORMATION ON THE WITH PROPOSAL. THE WEEK ISSUE. BY I CAN DO THAT IN THE THIRD TREASURER WOULD PREFER BECKY. WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN AND WE ARE PROCESS VOUCHERS FOR THEM MRS BEEN ON ONGOING CONTRACT FIRST QUITE SOME TIME. THE S. IT. IS -- GOING AWAY BECAUSE OF THE ELECTRONIC BENEFITS TRANSFER PROGRAM SIR PAPER VENTURES ARE BEING REPLACED BY ELECTRONIC CARDS. SO THAT WORKLOAD IS GOING TO GO AWAY AND IT'S GOING TO CALL THE CLIENT SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT CONTRACT. IS FOR ABOUT FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. SO THE CONTRACT ALSO SUPPORTS A LOT OF COST WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT INDIRECT COSTS SUCH AS THE OUR ADMIN EXECUTIVE AND IT COST SIR WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND REDIRECTING THOSE COST WILL BECAUSE OUR PROGRAM DIVISIONS TO HAVE TO INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENTS AND THERE ARE A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH. THAT NIGHT THANK GOD MISTER SCHAEFFER CAN SPEAK TO THOSE REST. THANK YOU BECKY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THE SEVERAL OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOSS OF WICKED BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE STATE LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY -- ACT. A REPORTS AT THE OFFICES MADE OUT JUST COVER TWO OF THEM. AND THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND. HAS CONSISTENTLY EXPRESSED SOME DISPLEASURE WITH THE OFFICE ON THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENTS WE SEEK FROM THEM. AND HAVE REPEATEDLY MENTIONED TO US THAT THEY WOULD HOPE -- TO SECURE LEGISLATION TO ENABLE THEM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STATE TREASURY. THANKFULLY THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED -- AT THIS POINT -- SIMILARLY THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES -- WHICH IS NOT REQUIRED -- TO KEEP FUNDS IN THE STATE TREASURY BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT STATE REVENUES -- VOLUNTARILY KEEPS FUNDS IN THE STATE TREASURY. THE RESULT IS THAT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A PROBLEM OF FIXED COSTS VERSUS VARIABLE COSTS. AS THE VARIABLE COSTS GO AWAY THE FIXED COSTS. ARE NOT NECESSARY REDUCED. IN A COMMENSURATE WAY AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WHAT WEEK I EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT. IS THAT -- WE WOULD -- WE WOULD SEEK TO AVOID -- KIND OF AN UP AND DOWN -- PROBLEM WITH THE FUNDING. LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD HAVE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE FAMILY. ONE OF THE INDIRECT COSTS THAT IS -- THAT IS FUNDED IN THIS FASHION IS THE LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND WHERE REIMBURSEMENTS ARE DISTRIBUTED. THROUGHOUT THE A A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND. SERVICES MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND OF CALIFORNIANS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BY ENABLING THEM TO INVEST ON TOP OF THE STATE TREASURER. SO WE DO -- HAVE SOME DEGREE OF ANXIETY ABOUT. BEING TOO VOLATILE IN THE LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENTS LAST WE SET OFF. AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING FOLKS WITHDRAW FROM THE LOCAL AGENCY FUND WE HAVEN'T QUIDDITY MEET SUCH DEMAND. BUT IT PROBABLY DOESN'T BENEFIT. TO THE PROGRAM AT ALL CANNOT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER OTHER QUESTIONS ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. UNDERSTAND STAFF IS GOING TO MEET WITH TREASURER STAFF ON THE SIDE AND COME BACK TO COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK FOR AN HOUR AND HOLD OPEN. NEXT ITEM. THANK YOU. I REMEMBER SIX MAYBE VISION HEALTHY PROPOSAL CAN YOU MISTER CHAIR DANIELLE BRANDON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDED A ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION PROPOSAL TO JUMPSTART HOUSING PRODUCTION. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES THAT SAME COMMITMENT TOM WITH A FEW KEY CHANGES. SO WITH REGARD TO THE PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS FOR HOUSING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED MISSED FIFTY MILLION FOR REGIONAL PLANNING. AND FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND EXPANSION THE MAY REVISION MAINTAINS THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR REGIONAL PLANNING THAT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TWO REGIONS AS DEFINED AND A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND WE KNOW THAT WE'VE ADDED SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS ELIGIBLE FOR THESE PLANNING GRANTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR JURISDICTIONS HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THEIR PLAN AND INCREASED HOUSING GOALS. THE MAY REVISION INSTEAD PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO PROVIDE GAP FUNDING TO NEW CONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS HIGH DENSITY AFFORDABILITY MIXED INCOME HOUSING. I AND SOME OF THE SHORT TERM GOALS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTABLISH NEW SHORT TERM GOALS THE MAY REVISION AMENDS THIS TO ALIGN THE HOUSING SHORT TERM. AB SORRY HOUSING SHORT TERM PRODUCTION GOALS WITH THE FORTHCOMING SIX CYCLE RENOWNED. IN ADDITION THE MAY REVISION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP LONG TERM REGIONAL HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS THE RENEW RINA PROCESS BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND MAINTAINS THE LINKAGE TO SB ONE FUNDING. MOVING ON TO THE HOMELESSNESS AID. SORRY. SO WITH HOMICIDE IN PLANNING FOR SHELTER PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDEDFIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS. AND PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR MEETING MILESTONES AS OUTLINED -- IN REQUIRED REGIONAL PLANS IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. THE MAY REVISION INCREASES THIS ALLOCATION TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. M. REMOVES THE INCENTIVE GRANT MEETING MILESTONES DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. THE MAY REVISION CHANGES DISTRIBUTE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO THE THIRTEEN LARGEST CITIES TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TWO COUNTIES AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. MAY REVISION ALLOCATES THESE BASED ON THAT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNT AS OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COUNT. IT ADDS FLEXIBILITY TO HELP FUNDS CAN BE SPENT IN CALLS OUT EMERGENCY SHELTERS NAVIGATION CENTERS. RAPIDLY HOUSING RENTAL ASSISTANCE PREVENTION PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING INNOVATIVE JOB PROGRAMS AND INNOVATIVE HOUSING PROJECTS AS POTENTIALLY USE OF FUNDS. FINALLY THE MAY REVISION MAKES APPLICATION PROCESS MORE FLEXIBLE IN ORIGINAL PLANS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED THEY CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE APPLICATION. AND AT THIS TIME I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I WILL. NEW THIS MORALIS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR OFFICE RAISED SOME CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET -- REGARDING HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS OVERALL WE THINK THAT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL MOVES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IN PARTICULAR THE RE PURPOSING OF GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS TOWARDS THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM AS WELL AS PROVIDING SPECIFIC HOMELESSNESS SERVICES WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO YIELD MORE CERTAIN BENEFITS. IN ITS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND HOMELESSNESS -- ONE AREA WHERE WE STILL WANT TO SORT OF MAKE NOTE OF IT IS THIS QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES ITS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS FUNDS IN PARTICULAR. THE GOVERNOR'S DECISION IT TO EXPAND RESOURCES TOWARDS HIGHER INCOME LEVELS AND WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST INTO THIS CONTINUES TO BE A POLICY QUESTION BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT REVISED. THAT ASPECT OF HIS PACKAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE THE STRUCTURE. SO FIRST LET ME JUST SAY I WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AROUND HOUSING AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE LEVELS OF FUNDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND DEATHLY DON'T WANT MY COMMENTS TO ME MISCONSTRUED IN NOT ME NOT SAYING THAT BIG PICTURE THANK YOU -- ONE QUESTION I HAD AROUND THE IN FILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM SO WHAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING AROUND TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT AND I WANTED TO ASK IF TRANSIT AGENCIES WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDING AND THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT IS. LAST YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD STREAMLINED HOUSING PRODUCTION ON PART OWN SURFACE PARKING LOTS AND SO. TRANSIT SYSTEM IS NOW IMPLEMENTING THE BILL BUT DOESN'T HAVE FUNDING FOR PLANNING OR STAFFING AND JUST THAT PARTICULAR BILL ALONE COULD RESULT IN THIRTY THOUSAND NEW UNITS OF HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA. WITH AT LEAST A THIRD OF THAT BEING AVAILABLE -- TO TO LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS SO. AT THE LEAST I'D LIKE TO ASK AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS AROUND WHETHER BART COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING. FOR IMPLEMENTING A LAW THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION ON PART OWNED LAND BUT MORE GENERALLY I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE INVOLVED IN PLANNING FOR HOUSING -- UNDER THE UNDER THAT TRANSIT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS ALONG WITH DEVELOPERS FOR THAT FOR THE CONNECTIONS BUT UNDER THE AYE AYE G. PROGRAM. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TRANSIT AGE I WOULD LET ME DOUBLE CHECK TO COME BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THE TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE ELIGIBLE OPTIONS AND OF THE INFIRM -- INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAMS I'D LIKE TO MAKE A SPECIFIC REQUEST THAT THAT BE CONSIDERED AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE THERE ARE DEVELOPER THE HOUSING NORMALLY WE WOULD OR THE THEY WERE DEVELOPER THEY WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE MANAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE PLAN IT IS PART OWN LAND. SO IT'S UP TO THEM AT THIS MOMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT AND THEY'RE IN. TWO DOZEN CONVERSATIONS -- AROUND TWENTY SIX PART STATIONS AND ALL THE CALIFORNIA HOW TO DO THAT AND IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT -- BOOST TO TO HOUSING PRODUCTION SO AT MY OFFICE HAPPY TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT THIS FURTHER BUT LIKE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THIS ACCOUNT. NOT SERVE YOU COULD GET BACK TO US ON A KIND OF AN ANSWER THE BIG RIGHT. ON THE OTHER SIDE TO QUESTIONS I HAVE -- PIGGY BACK ON THE ALLEY OWES QUESTIONS AROUND HOMELESSNESS -- SO FIRST AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SAY THE COMMITMENT OF THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT YOU ARE. GOING TO PUT INTO HOMELESSNESS IS IS FANTASTIC I KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS CHARACTERIZED THE MONEY AS GOING TO ONE TIME INTERVENTIONS -- BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE RESTRICTIONS OF FLEXIBILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO RESPOND HOMELESSNESS AND THE REALITY IS THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR OF SO CALLED ONE TIME FUNDING -- AND I THINK THEY'RE JUST CONCERNED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FOR SPENDING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IT BE PUT TO TO BEST USE AND I THINK WE ALL SHARE THAT. SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL PRECLUDE ANY OF THE JURISDICTIONS CITY COUNTY CONTINUANCE OF CARE. FROM USING FUNDING FOR INTERVENTIONS LIKE. THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF A SHELTER OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT LONGER TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE PERSONS RAPID RE HOUSING AND INCENTIVES TO LANDLORDS. TO ACCEPT TENANTS AND WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EFINITIONS OF THE LISTS OF USES FOR THESE FUNDS. SURE AND SO WE HAVE MADE THE USES A LOT MORE FLEXIBLE WITH REGARD TO THOSE SPECIFIC I DON'T BELIEVE THOSE ARE SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT I DON'T KNOW -- I'LL HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE LANGUAGE I'M SORRY JUST. WE RELEASED IT LAST NIGHT AND I'M STILL SETTING UP ON IT MYSELF AND BUT WE DO HAVE. SOME LATE NIGHT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I'M SORRY Là LATE NIGHT SO YEAH -- BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE EXPANDED THESE USES INTO AREAS WHERE THEY CAN BE USED AS ONE TIME FINDINGS AND BE MOST EFFECTIVELY IS STE OKAY. I THINK WHAT I WILL SAY IS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LIST. OF THE USE OF FUNDS THAT INCLUDE REAL EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES FOR MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. SO LONG TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT BASED HOUSING VOUCHERS THAT ARE TIED TO SUPPORT HOUSING. OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS I'LL JUST GIVE THE EXAMPLE THAT RAPID RE HOUSING WHILE IT'S BEEN USEFUL FOR SOME FOLKS HAS NOT BEEN AS EFFECTIVE AS I THINK WE ALL ANTICIPATED BECAUSE IT'S TIME LIMITED. AND AT THE END OF THE ASSISTANCE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO MOVE AND SO. MY HOPE IS THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE EXPLICITLY REQUIRES PROGRAM FUNDS TO BE SPENT ON INTERVENTIONS THAT MOVE PEOPLE TOWARD PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS -- AND THEN ONE THING I ACTUALLY LIKE TO ASK THAT BUT I HOPE IS IS NOT DIFFICULT AS I HOPE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES A REPORT BACK. TO ALL OF US ON THE USE OF FUNDS AND SPECIFICALLY HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MOVED INTO. PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS -- IF WE'RE GONNA SPEND YOU KNOW HALF BILLION LAST YEAR AND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR. WE NEED TO KNOW FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHAT'S WORKING SO THAT NEXT YEAR IF WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WHICH WE PROBABLY WELL. WE KNOW WHERE THE BEST ON THE MONEY I DON'T THINK ANYONE KNOWS THAT AT THIS POINT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND WE LIKE TO FIGURE THAT OUT. ONE LAST THING I KNOW WHO -- THE TROUBLING PATROL BILL LANGUAGE IS NOT A COME OUT ON THE LOW INCOME TAX BLOG HOUSING TAX CREDIT RIGHT THAT THAT WAS NOT AGENDAS FOR TODAY'S MEETING. TEL AVIV MORALS ASSEMBLY BUDGET IT IT CAME OUT AND THEN I GOT PULLED BACK THE RELATING TO SEE THE REVISED VERSION. BUT WE WERE TALKING WE JUST WANTED THEM TO THEY CAN TALK ABOUT ANY OF IT. OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO SET THIS POINT ON HOW YOU'RE PLANNING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES THAT ARE SWIRLING AROUND THE TAX FOR IT. AND THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS Sí CREDIT REALLY AND I JUST KNOW THAT WE ARE TAUGHT WE TOOK IT DOWN SO THAT BECAUSE WE REALIZE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO BE TAUGHT -- CHANGED A NET AND WORKING ON THOSE AND WILL BE POSTED AGAIN ONCE WE'VE REACHED DECISIONS ON APPRECIATE THAT I'D LET ME JUST TOUCH ON A FEW ISSUES THAT I'LL BE LOOKING AT WHICH IS. ONE I UNDERSTAND. THAT THE TRAILER BILL IS MAYBE PROPOSED A 30% CREDIT AS OPPOSED TO A 50% CREDIT -- HAVE QUESTIONS AROUND THAT -- WE KNOW THAT THE HIGHER CREDITS USUALLY NEEDED FOR HIGHER COST AREAS TO PROVIDE ENOUGH SUBSIDIES SO -- SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHETHER THE LOWER AMOUNT IS THE RIGHT ONE AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT DATA. OUT WHAT THAT WILL ENTAIL. THE SECOND THING I WANT TO MENTION IS JUST ENSURING THAT FOR THE CREDIT TO BE EFFECTIVE THAT IT BE ON GOING -- I KNOW YOU'RE VERY WHERE THE FACT THAT -- THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AS OLD AS A LOW IS A SIGNIFICANT AND APPRECIATED ONE TIME FUNDING PROPOSAL WHERE THE BROADER HOUSING COMMUNITY BELIEVES IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE HOUSING TAX CREDIT MARKET. FOR THERE TO BE ONGOING STREAMS OF FUNDING SO. AGAIN HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THAT -- AND THEN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE TROLL BILL LANGUAGE WILL PROPOSE A WARNING THE CREDIT ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS WITHOUT COMPETITION. AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS AND BEEN RAISED ABOUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE COMPETITION HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE QUALITY PROJECTS. SO -- LOVE TO AND HELP YOU GAUGE WITH US YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT BUT OBVIOUSLY Và COMES OUT WITH SOME OF THOSE ASPECTS I WILL HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THAT SO JUST WANNA SAY THAT UP FRONT. AND I'M GONNA FOR MY TWO CENTS IN WOULD ALLOW FOR HOMELESS IS THAT'S GREAT. I'M A STILL NOT DOING SO SOME OF THE ROOT ISSUES WITH GUARDING MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE THOSE ARE BIG ISSUES WITH THAT THIS IS. THAT'S ALL PART OF THE FRAMEWORK BUT A MYSTERY ONE PUBLIC COMMENT. NICOLE WATERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- WE'VE MUCH APPRECIATE THE REVISED HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL COMING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND ARE SUPPORTIVE OF IT BROADLY AND ARE STILL LOOKING. INTO THE DETAILS [inaudible] THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND YOUR AUNT WE WILL TRY YOUR AUNT'S WE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI WE SUPPORT THE MAYOR'S MY REVISED PROPOSAL ON HOUSING HOMELESSNESS. AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE URBAN CAUGHT. URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA -- RELATIVE TO THE HOUSING PROPOSAL WE SUPPORT THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR HOUSING RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT'S AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE PROJECTS IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS RELATIVE TO THE HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL WE WANT EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S REVISED PROPOSAL ON HOMELESSNESS. SPECIFICALLY WE SUPPORT THE INCREASE FLEXIBILITY TIED TO THE PROPOSAL THE INCREASE FUNDING OVERALL IN THE DIRECT ALLOCATION OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO COUNTIES. AND AS WELL AS THE TO USE OF THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN POINT TIME COUNTS. WE REALLY WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE DIRECT ALLOCATION TO COUNTY IS SHOULD BE VIEWED NOT JUST AS A SIDE ROAD PROJECTS. LED BY COUNTIES BUT AS INVESTMENTS IN SYSTEM LEVEL COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES TO AND HOMELESSNESS THANK YOU. FOR FINANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE HOMELESS FUNDING CAN EXPLAIN WHAT THE GOVERNOR ADDED A NEW PART OF FUNDING FOR COUNTIES. IN WITH THE COUNTIES HAVING THE PRIMARY ROLE OF SERVICES. HOW WILL THEY USE THIS FUNDING? SURE AND SO WITH THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE HEAP FUNDING I'M THE PLAN WITH THE REGIONAL PLANS WAIT THERE IS AN INDICATED NEED FOR COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL ROLE IN THOSE REGIONAL PLANNING -- THAT. PORTIONS BY APOLOGIES -- SO THEY WILL NEED FUNDING FOR THAT AND I'M SORRY [inaudible] A THEIR INDIVIDUAL ROLE IN THE REGIONAL PLANNING IS A NEED AND IN ADDITION WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE STILL WORKING WITH THE KEEP FUNDING. WE DON'T WANT TO INUNDATE THEM TOO MUCH WITH TOO MUCH FUNDS WE SPREAD OUT THAT'S WHY. WHO'S IN CHARGE THE PLANNING THAN FOR THE REGIONAL HOUSING. THE REGIONAL PLANS I'M SORRY. WHO'S IN CHARGE YES MENTION IT SHOULD BE A GROUP EFFORT BETWEEN ALL OF THE PARTIES WITHIN THE REGION. IS IT A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. CAN I DOUBLE CHECK AND GET BACK TO YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. THERE WERE HOLES AUTUMN OPEN. EVEN ANSWER TODAY OR I'LL GET BACK TO THIS AFTERNOON YES RIGHT HERE OKAY -- SADDAM OPEN OUR NEXT ISSUE IS UNDER SEVEN HOMELESS COORDINATING A FINANCE COUNCIL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JENNY PARTY FOOT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION -- REQUEST NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND AND SIX POSITIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY AND THEN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND AND THREE POSITIONS ON GOING. TO EXPAND THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. THREE OF THE PROPOSED POSITIONS WOULD BE LIMITED TERM -- FOR TWO YEARS TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTING KEEP NOW THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN DISBURSED -- THE STAFF NEED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT AND MONITORING TO BE SURE THAT HE FUNDS ARE USED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WE ARE REQUESTING THREE PERMANENT STAFF TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT. THE ONGOING ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAM ACTIVITIES FOR THE COUNCIL. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE STAFFING AND SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSED NEW GRANT PROGRAM. THOSE COSTS WOULD BE COVERED BY THE PROPOSED 5% ALLOCATION FOR STATE OPERATIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OIL. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD WITH. EXCUSE ME MR AGAIN LOOKING FORWARD WELL THE STAFF ALSO HELP MR THE NEW PROGAM IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE. NO THESE FUNDS WOULD NOT BE USED FOR ADMINISTERING THE NEW PROGRAM. ADMINISTRATING AND STAFFING COSTS FOR THE PROPOSED NEW PROGRAM WOULD COME OUT OF THE 5% -- ALLOCATION FOR STATE OPERATIONS THAT IS INCLUDED IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THAT PROGRAM. SO THIS WOULD BE ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THE COUNCIL'S MANDATES -- AND IMPLEMENTING HEAT FOR THE THE DURATION OF THE GRANT PROGRAM ARE THE PROGRAMS PRETTY SIMILAR LOW -- THEY ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OF ONE IS THE ADDITION OF COUNTIES IS ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. SO THE NUMBER OF GRANTEES WILL INCREASE FROM THE FORTY FOUR CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND ELEVEN LARGE CITIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEAP. TO THE THIRTEEN LARGE CITIES THE FORTY FOUR CONTINUES OF CARE AND THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO THAT'S AN INCREASE. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ADDITION THE REGIONAL PLANS THAT ARE REQUIRED. IN ORDER -- TO GET ACCESS TO THESE NEW FUNDS WILL REQUIRE SOME WORKLOAD AND SOME REVIEW BY THE COUNCIL STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THOSE PLANS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSED USE OF THE NEW GRANT PROGRAM FUNDS THAT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF ENTITIES DOING THEIR OWN THING SHOULDN'T IT BE MORE COORDINATED VERSES ARE PRETTY. WELL THE TEAM WILL BE LED BY SOMEONE WHO WILL BE OVERSEEING BOTH OF THE GRANT PROGRAMS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM HE IS THAT. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS IS REALLY -- REALLY AN IMPORTANT ROLE AND THAT THE GRANT MANAGEMENT ROLE CAN BE PERFORMANCE YOU KNOW UNDER THAT KIND OF THE PROGRAM IF YOU WILL THAT LOCAL PARTNERSHIP CAP -- AND SO WE WOULD PROPOSE TO HAVE THE GRANT MANAGER FOR HEAP -- AND THEN A NEW GRANT MANAGER FOR THE NEW PROPOSED PROGRAM. THAT'S LOW NEW GRANTEES FOR THE PROGRAM NOT THE STAFF CORRECT. A THAT'S CORRECT. IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY MISTER CHAIR. YES. IT'S IT WOULD BE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF THE GRANTEES BUT NOT STAFF NOT STAFF NOT CURRENTLY. THAT WOULD THAT THE PROPOSED STAFF WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY REVIEWED AND DONE THE ANALYSIS YET TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR THE NEW PROGRAM WOULD BE REQUIRED IN STORE EXPECTATION IS THAT. THE 5% THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE GRANT PROGRAM FOR STATE OPERATIONS WOULD BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO COVER ADDITIONAL COSTS RIGHT BUT THAT WILL GO BACK TO MY POINT EVERYONE DOING THEIR OWN THING AND NOT BEING COORDINATED. TOGETHER THEY'LL ALL STILL BE UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY AND WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNCIL AND WHAT IS THE OVERSIGHT CONSIST OF HELL. HOW MUCH OVER CIDER MINIMAL ONE OF THE NEW ONE OF THE NEW PROPOSED PERMANENT POSITIONS WOULD BE A NEW DEPUTY SECRETARY WHO WOULD FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE HOMELESSNESS INITIATIVES -- THAT ARE OVERSEEN BY AGENCY CURRENTLY BOTH THE HOUSING PORTFOLIO AND THE HOMELESSNESS PORTFOLIO ARE OVERSEEN BY ONE PERSON ONE DEPUTY SECRETARY. AND SO GIVEN THE INCREASE IN ATTENTION -- IN THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING -- INITIATED. AGENCY WOULD PROPOSE TO HAVE THOSE TWO THAT ONE POSITION SPLIT INTO TWO HIGH LEVEL DEPUTY SECRETARIES TO REALLY OVERSEE. THE HOMELESS IS PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE HOW THE COUNCIL HEAP. AND THE NEW PROGRAM.

DECLINING SHARE OF EXPORTS FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND DECLINING SHARE OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM 25% IN. THE SAME TIME OTHER STATES HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY. IN ARE GAINING SHARE. FORTY OF FIFTY STATES HAVE INTERNATIONAL TRADE SPECIALISTS. WHEN CALIFORNIA ELIMINATED MOST OF ITS INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT SPENDING IN? TWO THOUSAND THREE THE WORLD WAS NOT CONNECTED LIKE IT IS TODAY. THE INTERNET WAS IN ITS INFANCY. CHINA WAS NOT THE ECONOMIC POWER IT IS TODAY. OTHER STATES HAD NOT RAMPED UP THEIR INTERNATIONAL TRADE EFFORTS. TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND CALIFORNIA MUST CHANGE WITH THEM IF IT WANTS TO MAINTAIN ITS SHARE. OF WORLD TRADE AND INVESTMENT. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE FINANCE [inaudible] L. L.. BRENT WITH THE FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE AS IT AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA THE STATE'S TRY ATTRACT TECHNOLOGY TRADE AND COMMERCE AGENCY ONCE HAD AN EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL TRADE. PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN THAT AGENCY WAS ABOLISHED -- OUR OFFICE ROUTE ON THAT. THAT WE LONG HAD QUESTIONED THE VALUE AND IMPACT OF MANY OF THE AGENCY'S PROGRAMS. WE FOUND THAT EVEN AT PEAK FUNDING. THE STATE STREET AGENCY PROGRAMS ASSISTED ONLY A VERY SMALL PORTION. OF TARGETED. INDUSTRIES ARE BUSINESSES. AND WE SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR IMPACT. ON EXPORTS OR FOREIGN INVESTMENT. OVER THAT PERIOD OF THE LATE EIGHTIES NINETIES INTO THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT STATE INVOLVEMENT IS UNNECESSARY. IN MOST INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT AFFECT A STATE SHARE. OF INTERNATIONAL EXPORTS AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. AND WE ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE RESOURCES REQUESTED BY GOBIZ WOULD HAVE MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON THAT TREND THAT. THAT THE GOV IS MENTIONED JUST RECENTLY. MOREOVER TO THE EXTENT THAT COMPANIES CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY TRANSACT BUSINESS IN FOREIGN MARKETS ON THEIR OWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL TRADE ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. STATISTICAL INFORMATION OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES AND ASSISTANCE. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST FOR THESE -- THREE POSITIONS THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO OPEN A PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE SIDE OF MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S LOUISE PORT DEAL WITH THE INLAND EMPIRE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS I E.

YOU KNOW DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S GROWTH TO BECOME THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

YOU KNOW INLAND EMPIRE HAS GROWN OVER THE PAST YEARS TO BECOME THE LOGISTICS HUBS FOR THE STATE IN THE NATION. HOWEVER YOU KNOW IF WE WANT TO GROW BEYOND THAT WILL GO AB ECONOMY THAT THOSE ON THE OTHER THAN THAT.
