PARENTS AND SIBLINGS THESE

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:11.309
PATIENTS HAVE FOUGHT WARS TO

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:13.845
DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS LIVE DURING

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:14.779
AND CAME OUT OF THE GREAT

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:17.382
DEPRESSION AND BUILT OUR

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:19.651

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.186

THIS VIRUS WITH THEIR CARE

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:27.025
GIVERS. WE UNDERSTAND HOW THIS

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.027
VIRUS SPREADS AND YET WE HAVE

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:31.896
ISOLATED THE SENIOR SENIORS AND

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:33.665
THEY'RE DYING ALONE BECAUSE WE

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:36.034
ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH. PERHAPS

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.602
IN REFLECTION WE CAN FINALLY

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:40.004
ACKNOWLEDGE COVERT NINETEEN

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:42.173
DIDN'T CAUSE THESE PROBLEMS BUT

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.242
DRAMATICALLY REVEALED THE

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.263
AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE TO

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.265

LACK OF CONSISTENT TESTING OF

STRATEGY. THE BROADER ISSUE IS

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:26.251
UNFORTUNATELY NOT A NEW ONE IT

00:31:26.317 --> 00:31:27.518
IS ROOTED IN OUR COLLECTIVE

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:29.721
FAILURE TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY

00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:31.990
TO TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM OF CARE

MANY OF THESE SAME ISSUES SOME

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:06.224
TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO. THE

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:07.392
STATE'S CURRENT OVERSIGHT

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:09.661
STRUCTURE IS TOO FRAGMENTED TO

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.462
ALLOW EFFECTIVE COORDINATION

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.431

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:18.636
INSTITUTIONALIZATION AT THE

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:20.471
EXPENSE OF HOME AND COMMUNITY

00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:22.707
BASED SERVICES PERFORMED A

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:24.142
PREFERRED BY CONSUMERS

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:26.711
CONSUMERS CONTINUE. TO TAKE

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.313
ISSUE WITH THE QUALITY OF CARE

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:30.048
AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:32.150
AND REGULATORY CHANGE HAS NOT

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:33.451
KEPT PACE WITH THE CHANGING

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:34.952
DEMANDS PLACED ON RESIDENTIAL

CARE FACILITIES. ALL SEEM TO

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:40.058
COMMON THESE DAYS AS WELL. SO

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:42.026
WHY HASN'T MUCH HAPPENED FOR

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:43.695
OVER TWENTY FOUR YEARS

00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:45.063
UNFORTUNATELY OUR FAILURE TO

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.764
ACT STEMS FROM A MUCH LARGER

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.499
PROBLEM ROOTED IN PERVASIVE

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:51.336
SOCIETAL AGEISM AND ABLE ISM

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.571
THAT HAS NOT PRIORITIZE THE

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:54.439
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS OLDER

00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:57.041
ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:59.644
AND CARE GIVERS. WE SHOULD ADD

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:01.245
TO THIS ALSO THE DRIVE OF

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:05.016
PROFITEERING. AS A BODY WE NEED

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:06.851
TO PRIORITIZE THESE ISSUES AND

00:33:06.918 --> 00:33:09.721
INVEST IN INNOVATION. AND WE

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:10.321
NEED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF

00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:12.990
AGEISM. IF WE ARE NOT USING

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:14.459
THIS TIME TO DEMAND CHANGE THEN

00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:17.962
WHEN. PRIOR TO COVERT NINETEEN

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:19.263
WE DISCUSSED THE NEEDS OF THE

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.299
GROWING POPULATION OF SENIORS

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:22.934
AND WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE IN

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.603
TEN YEARS. BUT OUR INACTION AND

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.071
WEAK FOUNDATIONS RELATING TO

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:28.773
SENIORS AND THE DISABLED

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.708
COMPOUNDED WITH COVERT NINETEEN

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:31.943
WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE THE

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:33.911
NUMBERS OF SENIORS. IN OUR

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:36.047
STATE AND NATION AT A TIME WHEN

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:37.849
THERE'S GONNA BE HISTORICAL

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.084
GROWTH OF THAT AGE POPULATION.

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:41.486
THE MAY REVISED IS AN EXAMPLE

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:43.955
OF AGEISM. IT ON FAIRLY

00:33:44.021 --> 00:33:46.090
BALANCED CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET ON

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:47.792
THE SHOULDERS OF OUR FRAIL

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.994
ELDERLY ELDERLY AND DISABLED.

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:52.130
IT IS A PROPOSAL THAT IS UNJUST

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:54.565
AND UNFAIR. I'M PROUD OF THE

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:56.634
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL WE WILL BE

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.669
VOTING ON WITHIN A WEEK. OUR

VALUES ARE CLEAR WE WILL NOT

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.006
FURTHER HARM SENIORS AND THE

AND WHEN HE SAID THAT WE HAVE

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.468
NOT HAD SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT.

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:25.936
THAT WE LACK SUFFICIENT

00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:28.072
COMMUNITY SETTINGS FOR US TO BE

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.107
ABLE TO AGE IN PLACE WITH

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:32.977

ARE THINGS THAT WE HAD BEEN

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.475
WORKING ON OVER THE LAST YEAR

00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:06.910
BUT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPEDITE

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:07.778
THEM THROUGH THE EXISTING YOU

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:09.880
KNOW PROCESS. AND SOME OF THESE

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:12.349
THINGS ARE NEW AND BRAND NEW

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:14.451
NOT ONLY TO CALIFORNIA BUT

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:15.452
THERE WILL BE A BRAND NEW TO

00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:17.154
THE NATION. I A PROPOSED THESE

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:19.523
SIX STRATEGIES TO SEE EN MASSE

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.758
THEY ARE VERY INTERESTED AS

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:21.759
WELL BECAUSE THEY ALSO

00:44:21.825 --> 00:44:25.162
RECOGNIZE. IT AS A NATION THERE

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:28.399
IS TO DO. SO THE STRATEGY THAT

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:29.700
I WANTED OVER FIRST AND FOR

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.268
TESTING WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:33.103
KNOW WHERE IT IS AT ALL TIMES.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.072
SO WE HAVE REQUIRED ALL OF OUR

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:36.140
FACILITIES TO DO BASELINE

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:39.076
TESTING WHICH MEANS. ALL STAFF

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:41.111
ALL RESIDENTS MUST BE TESTED BY

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:42.780
JUNE THIRTIETH. AND THEY HAVE

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:45.549
TO REPORT THOSE TESTING RESULTS

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:46.150
TO US AND WE POST THEM ON OUR

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.318
WEBSITE THEN AFTER THAT THERE

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:49.987
IS A POSITIVE CASE JUST ONE

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.121
POSITIVE CASE THE WILL DO

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.890
REPEAT TESTING FOR EVERYONE

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:55.059
THAT FACILITY EVERY WEEK. UP IF

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.727
THEY HAVE ZERO POSITIVES THAN

00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:57.594
THEY WILL DO SURVEILLANCE

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:59.496
TESTING OF ALL THE HEALTHCARE

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:01.231
WORKERS 25% A WEEK UNTIL YOU

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:02.699
HAVE ALL OF THE HEALTHCARE

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:03.367
WORKERS ONCE A MONTH GETTING

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:05.969
TESTED. UP THE SECOND STRATEGY

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:07.104
IS REALLY ABOUT FAXING

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:09.306
PREVENTION WORK FORCE- SO WE

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.608
REALIZE THAT. MANY FACILITIES

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:14.111
ONLY HAVE A PART TIME I KEY. IN

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:15.579
THERE- IN THEIR SKILLED NURSING

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:16.914
FACILITY WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.382
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE MULTIPLE

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.917
HATS WHAT ROLES THEY HAVE TO

00:45:19.983 --> 00:45:22.586
KERRY. SO WE ALSO ISSUED AN AFL

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:24.755
THAT STATES THAT EVERY SNAP IN

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:26.423
CALIFORNIA MUST HAVE A FULL

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.258
TIME INFECTION PREVENTION THIS.

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:29.893
OF WHETHER THEY HAVE TWO PEOPLE

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.795
TOGETHER OF THAT ARE THEN

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.330
TRAINED EITHER BY OUR STAFF

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:34.465
WE'VE OFFERED TRAINING TO BE

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:35.499
ABLE TO DO THAT TO GET THEM

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.935
SOME COMPETENCY TESTING. OF BUT

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:40.237
THAT IS A MUST. OF THE THIRD

00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:41.872
STRATEGY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:43.240
OPERATIONALLY SCENE IS JUST

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.109
SHEER EDUCATION NOT ONLY RE

00:45:45.175 --> 00:45:46.777
EDUCATING ALL OF OUR SURVEYORS

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:49.646
ON. PARTICULAR I. T. OF HIGH

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:51.381
INFECTIOUS DISEASES BUT ALSO

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.450
WORKING WITH ALL OF THE AN ACE

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:56.453
LPN. RN OUT THERE IN THESE

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.455
FACILITIES. OF FOR. IS

00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:00.457
SOMETHING THAT IS BRAND NEW TO

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.925
THE NATION AND THIS IS

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:03.160
COMPLETELY CHANGING AND

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:04.428
REFORMING HOW WE WOULD DO

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:06.797
QUALITY SAFETY OVERSIGHT. SO IN

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:09.533
LIEU OF. OR IN ADDITION TO THAT

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.736
ONCE A YEAR CMS CERTIFICATION.

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:15.105
SURVEY IN ADDITION OUR STATE

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:18.642
WHAT ALSO A SIGN TO THREE.

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:20.611
FACILITIES TO EACH ONE OUR

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:23.680
SERVER. THEY HAVE TO HELP.

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.949
SHIFT EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SB

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:30.254
WHEN WE- TO CHECK DALY PART OF

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:30.954
QUALITY SAFETY OVER GROUP THE

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.256
BE ABLE TO TRAIN STAFF IF TO BE

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:33.824
ON SITE EVERY WEEK AND WE

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:35.159
BELIEVE THAT THAT PRESENCE WILL

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:36.260
MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:37.761
ALREADY IN THIS PANDEMIC WE

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.329
HAVE BEEN MORE ON SITE THAN WE

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:41.698
EVER HAVE BEFORE IN HERE

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:43.333
ALREADY NOTICING A BIG

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.802
DIFFERENCE IN THE B. P. PLACES

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:48.071
THAT WERE GOING AS WELL AS WERE

00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:48.772
NOTICING A DIFFERENCE THE

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:53.443
ABILITY TO- MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.745
OF DEATH IN CASE IT. UP THE

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.747
FIFTH ONE IS QUALITY AND SAFETY

00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:58.982
OVERSIGHT ACT. SO THIS IS THE

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.884
STATE WHERE ALL STATES ACTUALLY

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:01.919
HAVE BEEN DOING MOST OF THE

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.887
LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION. BY

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:07.357
PAPER AND MANUAL PROCESSES IT'S

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:07.925
TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED TO BE

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:09.493
ABLE TO HAVE REAL TIME DATA AS

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.061
WELL AS- BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:13.130
FACILITIES AND TRANSPARENCY TO

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.331
BE ABLE EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:15.766
SEE WHAT WERE SEEN. WHAT

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:17.901
RECITING. WHAT THE PLANS ARE

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.803
CORRECTION ARE AND ONCE WE HAVE

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.104
THIS MOBILE APP WHERE TO A

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:22.439
PORTAL SYSTEM CLOUD BASED

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:24.041
SYSTEM THAT WE BE ABLE TO THAT.

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.842
IMMEDIATELY POST THE RESULTS

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.244
THE FACILITY WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:28.512
IMMEDIATELY ENTER THEIR PLANS A

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:29.947
CORRECTION. ALL OF THAT WOULD

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:32.282
BE TRANSPARENT FOR OUR

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:34.117
STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL. AND LAST

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:34.785
BUT NOT LEAST PREDICTIVE

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:36.753
ANALYTICS. LICENSING AND

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.555
CERTIFICATION ACROSS THE NATION

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:40.657
TENDS TO BE A VERY REACTIVE

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:42.993
TYPE OF WORK. YOU GO AND ONCE A

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.995
YEAR ON A SCHEDULE. YOU GO IN

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.964
WHEN THERE IS A REACTION TO

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.334
EITHER CMPLAINTS. OR INCIDENT.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.635
AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.070
CREATE MORE OF A PROACTIVE

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.705
APPROACH AND SO WHAT WE STARTED

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:56.373
TO DO IN THESE LAST COUPLE OF.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.375
MONTHS IT STARTED TO GATHER

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:01.044
DATA. NOT ONLY DATA FROM. HIM

00:48:01.111 --> 00:48:02.946
COMPLAINTS HISTORY IN THE PAST.

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:04.982
BUT ALSO. SELECTING DATA FROM

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.183
THE DAILY REPORTING THAT WE'RE

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.151
REQUIRING ALL OF THE FACILITIES

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:09.653
TO PROVIDE AT. WE TAKE ALL THAT

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.288
DATA AND COME UP WITH THE HIGH

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:13.090
RISK LIST EVERY DAY. IF YOU'RE

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.558
A FACILITY AND UP ON THE HIGH

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:16.193
RISK LIST THEY GET AN IMMEDIATE

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.028
PHONE CALL REACH OUT AND THEN

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:19.963
WE ALSO GO ON SITE. THAT WEEK

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.832
TO BE ABLE. TO SEE WHAT'S GOING

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:24.468
ON. AND SO TRYING TO LOOKING.

00:48:24.534 --> 00:48:27.437
INDICATORS AND A ESTABLISHED

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:30.207
KIND OF A PROJECT OF. I THINK

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:32.342
IT. MAY BE. WITH STAFF SHE-

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.477
WHERE MIGHT BE A- SECTION

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:34.878
CONTROL ISSUES THAT'S ALLOWING

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.346
US TO BE WAY MORE PROACTIVE

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:38.282
THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND SO ALL

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:40.717
OF THIS IS BRAND NEW. IT'S

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.552
DEFINITELY LEANING FORWARD. AND

00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:44.354
SO FAR WHAT I WAS HAPPY TO SEE

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:47.424
IT AS WE STARTED TO- ROLL OUT

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:48.725
SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES AND

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:50.160
SOME OF THESE OTHER INITIATIVES

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.061
OLD ROLL OUT THIS SUMMER AND

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:53.730
FALL. OF WE WERE HAPPY TO SEE

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.065
THAT AT LEAST TO SEE A MASK THE

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:57.467
CMS DATA CAME OUT LAST WEEK.

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.670
SHOWED THAT. DESPITE THE FACT

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:02.339
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. MORE

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:04.141
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AS

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:05.642
WELL AS SKILLED NURSING SKILLED

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:07.844
NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS. WE

00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:09.212
HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED TWENTY

00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:11.848
FOUR. HOWEVER WE ARE TWENTY

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:13.517
THIRD IN THE AVERAGE DEATH RATE

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:15.819
AND WE ARE BY FAR. LOWER THAN

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:17.287
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AVERAGE IN

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:19.256
EVERY KEY INDICATOR. WHETHER

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:20.257
THAT'S CASES BUT THAT THAT

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.559
STAFF. BUT THE STAFF RESIDENTS

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.861
WE ARE BY FAR LOWER THAN ANY

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:26.596
OTHER STATE. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:49:26.663 --> 00:49:27.998
BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.232
BEEN DOING ON SITE BECAUSE THE

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:30.600
OTHER SET OF DATA THAT CMS

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.302
RELEASED LAST WEEK. WITH THE

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:34.504
AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT SURVEYORS

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:36.673
HAVE PHYSICALLY BEEN ON SITE.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.641
AND YOU CAN SEE A DIRECT

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:40.143
CORRELATION. BETWEEN CALIFORNIA

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.378
WOULD BEEN ON SITE TO OLDER

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:44.081
FACILITIES. EXCEPT FOR A FEW

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.816
WHICH WE ARE ACTUALLY FINISHING

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:47.684
UP THIS MONTH. BUT ALL OF THOSE

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:50.053
FACILITIES DIRECTLY CORRELATES

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.621
TO READ THEN YOU SEE THE CASES

00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:53.190
BY DEATH RATE. AND THEN YOU

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.458
LOOK AT OTHER STATES THAT WERE

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.860
ON THEIR 30% OF THE TIME 20% OF

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:58.628
THE TIME AND YOUR SEEN A HUGE

00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:00.764
HUGE IMPACT. IN IN THEIR DEATH

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.566
RIGHT AND SO WE DID. THAT

00:50:02.632 --> 00:50:04.401
ISSUES ME TO PLEASE YES I ARE

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:06.536

WOULDN'T MIND WOULD YOU PLEASE

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:14.978
WRAP UP. WE CAN'T HAVE ALL

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:17.314
RIGHT PANELISTS GO TEN MINUTES

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:17.881
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK FOR

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:20.851
SO. SORRY MY APOLOGIES. NOW

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:22.386
THAT'S FINE I JUST WANTED TO

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:23.186
SAY THAT THERE'S A CORRELATION

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:26.723
WE SEE THAT THERE'S AN- ADD.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.658
WELCOME THAT CHANGE. AND I WANT

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:30.260

TODAY. SO THAT WE CAN BE ABLE

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:35.766
TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS

00:50:35.832 --> 00:50:37.501
TOGETHER. THANK YOU IT WILL BE

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:30.046
GARGANTUAN EFFORT AND A

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:31.848
HERCULEAN EFFORT I THINK THAT

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:33.983
THE STATE HAS HAD TO UNDERGO.

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:37.987
TO BRING TESTING TESTING- UP.

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:40.723

ABLE TO ACT. AND NUMBER SIX

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:54.671
THIS ONE POINT TO BE VERY CLEAR

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:56.606
ABOUT AS WELL. SKILLED NURSING

00:57:56.673 --> 00:57:58.474
WERE REALLY NOT HAPPY.

00:57:58.541 --> 00:57:59.676
BEGINNING OF THIS PAN I THINK I

00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:00.410
THINK ANYONE WHO AT THIS STORE

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:04.514

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:07.917
M. THAT'S WHERE NO CAST KNOWS

00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:08.885
BIRD I DON'T BELIEVE BECAUSE I

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:12.322
THINK. THE ENTIRE SOCIETY

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:13.256
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.891
GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:16.593
EVERYONE WAS MUCH MORE FOCUSED

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:17.994
INITIALLY ON THE HOSPITAL'S

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:21.531
KNOWING THAT WE MIGHT BE FORTY

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:22.332
THOUSAND HOSPITAL BIT SHORT.

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:22.832
SNIFFS WE'RE NOT AT THE

00:58:22.899 --> 00:58:24.200
BEGINNING OF THE LINE AND SO

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:26.202
CONSEQUENCES THAT. BEING

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:28.571

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:33.843
CONFLICTING STANDARDS AND

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.445

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.054
GUIDANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:46.256

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:02.951
DOESN'T HELP THE NARRATIVE IN

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.621
ANY WAY. IF ANYTHING IT COME IT

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:07.723
COMPOUNDS THE GUILT AND THE

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.058
ANXIETY THAT THE RESIDENTS

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:11.060
EXPERIENCE AND THOSE WHO LOVE

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.195
THEM SO WHAT I'M HERE TODAY TO

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.831
SAY IS WE NEED TO BE FLOODING

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.866
THESE FACILITIES WITH RESOURCES

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.001
AS WELL AS HOLDING THEM

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.402
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PROBLEM FOR

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.838
THAT FOR CARE THAT THEY ARE

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:23.872
MANDATED TO PROVIDE. SO UNDER

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:26.175
THE GUISE OF RESOURCES THE FOR

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:26.642

OMBUDSMAN'S BACK IN THE

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:29.078

THAT WE DO THIS **** NILLY I'M

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:31.513
SUGGESTING THAT IS DONE

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.148
THOUGHTFULLY AND WITH. A

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:33.949
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:36.985
APPROPRIATE. I CAN ASSURE YOU.

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:38.454
EVERY LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.022
IS INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:41.623
FACILITIES THAT STRUGGLE TO

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.392
PROVIDE GOOD CARE PRIOR TO THE

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.227
NINETEEN. AND IT IS THOSE

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:46.462
FACILITIES THAT OUR GREATEST

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:47.896
RISK THAT THE OMBUDSMAN'SARE

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:50.232
ANXIOUS TO GET BACK IN AND LOOK

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:51.600
BEHIND THE CURTAIN. THE SECOND

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.836
RESOURCE. THE STATE NEEDS TO

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.205
ADDRESS THE ISSUE. SHAMEFUL

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.740
PRACTICE WITH VERY FEW

01:12:57.806 --> 01:13:00.075
EXCEPTIONS. OF PAYING CNA IS A

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:02.878
POVERTY WAGE. YEAR AFTER YEAR

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.346
WE HEAR THE INDUSTRY LIMIT THAT

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:06.148
THEY CAN'T KEEP STAFF. AND

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:07.382
RATHER THAN ADDRESSING THE

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.751
ISSUE THE NEED TO PAY A

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.552
PROFESSIONAL WAGE. FACILITY

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:11.820

CARING DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS WE

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.463
CAN'T BE SO NAIVE AS TO THINK

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.132
THAT THEY'RE WORKING SIXTY TO

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:25.000
EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK IN MULTIPLE

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:25.701
FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY LOVE

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.503
WHAT THEY DO. THEY WORK THESE

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:30.038
KINDS OF OURS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:30.606
WHAT'S REQUIRED TO COVER THE

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:33.509
RENT. EVEN DURING A PANDEMIC

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:34.777
BOTH INDUSTRY AND DEPARTMENT

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:35.911
LEADERS JUSTIFIED THE

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:37.946
CONTINUING UTILIZATION OF CARE

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.248
STAFF WORKING IN MULTIPLE

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.350
FACILITIES. WITH SEEMINGLY NO

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:42.818
REGARD TO THE FACT THAT CARE

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:45.087
STAFF WITH NO MALICE INTENT ON

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.822
THEIR PART. WE'RE SPREADING OF

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:49.892
THE NINETEENTH FROM FACILTY TO

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:50.425
FACILITY AND ACROSS COUNTY

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:52.427
LINES. INDUSTRY DEPARTMENT

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.829
LEADERS STATED PUBLICLY THEIR

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:55.898
FEARS THAT IF FACILITIES DIDN'T

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:56.899
YOU STAFF THAT WORKED IN

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:58.000
MULTIPLE FACILITIES THEY

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.835
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COVER THEIR

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:02.104
BE SHIPPED. AND WHILE TARGET

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.072
AND SAFE WAY. FOUND A WAY TO

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.874
PAY HAS A DIFFERENTIAL THIS

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.810
INDUSTRY REFUSES TO LET THE

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:09.878
GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE. AND I

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:11.680
BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNOW

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:13.248
THAT IF THEY DID PAY A SALARY

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:14.516
WORTHY OF THE HARD WORKING

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:17.252
PROFESSIONAL JOB OF CARING. FOR

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:19.021
ELDERLY AND FRAIL RESIDENTS

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.856
THEY WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO

POINT TO THE HIGH TURNOVER OF

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:23.859

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:26.195
FACILITIES IT'S MORE THAN 60%

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:28.230
EVERY YEAR AS THE REASON WHY

TAKE CARE WHY THEY'RE

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:30.732
CHRONICALLY OPERATE SHORT

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.234
STAFFED. AND WHY THEY CAN'T GET

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.503
A HANDLE ON FACILITY COMPLIANCE

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:36.338

EXTREMELY SHORT TERM CHALLENGES

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:50.572
WITH THE BUDGET PICTURE BUT

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.539

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:02.250
PASS A BACK TO YOU YOU MISTER

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:04.552
CHAIR BUT WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.688
LEASE A COLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN A

LONGTIME ADVOCATE AND- WAS A

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.125
WONDERFUL SPEAKER ON THIS

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:13.094
PANEL. THINK SHE- IDENTIFIED AN

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:15.397
ISSUE THAT MANY OF US FOR.

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:16.531
YEARS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.500
WHICH IS A- LACK OF ADEQUATE

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:22.103
WORK FORCE WITHIN THIS AREA.

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:22.937
AND I THINK YOUR IDENTIFICATION

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:26.541
OF HAZARD PAY IS SPOT ON AS WE

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:28.476

PROTOCOLS AND BELIEVE THAT AS

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:38.486
WE ARE INCREASING THOSE SKILLS

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:40.488
WE SHOULD ALSO BE INCREASING

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:42.957
THEIR PAY. AS THAT WILL HELP US

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:45.660
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR ELDERLY OUR

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:47.362

OVERDUE AND I THINK WE AS A

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.168
STATE SHOULD LOOK TO FIGURE OUT

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:55.036
HOW TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:57.706
IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY. SO WE CAN

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:58.606

AT THIS AND TRYING TO GET SOME

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.065
NUMBERS OF THE NUMBERS WERE

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:39.400

VOLUNTARILY COMING IN SO I WAS

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:42.971
WONDERING FROM A STATE

PERSPECTIVE HOW ARE WE MAKING

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:45.573
SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.741
ACCURATE. THIS IS MY FIRST

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:50.278
QUESTION SECONDLY I KNOW MR

BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:58.686
OUR GOAL THAT THAT WAS THE

BIGGEST PLEA FROM THEM AS THEY

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:01.890

THIS TO MEET THESE NEEDS.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.514
ANTICIPATING THESE NEEDS

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:29.050
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS- AND

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.485
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:32.954
I MEAN AT ONE IN EVERY FIVE.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.089
NURSING FACILITY AS SOME OF

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:37.992
CORONAVIRUS INCIDENT. SO TRYING

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:52.273
PLEASE. THAT QUESTION I BELIEVE

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.641
YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT- YOUR

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:55.476
LOVED ONE WAS IN IN KERN COUNTY

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:56.911
AND I'M I'M VERY WELL AWARE OF.

01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:59.180
THE OUTBREAKS. WE'VE HAD A KERN

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:02.216
INTO LARRY. AND IN THOSE CASES

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:04.118
IN IN ESPECIALLY IN KERN COUNTY

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:05.887
REMEMBER EARLY ON. WE WOULD

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:07.422
SEND A TEAM WITHIN TWENTY FOUR

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:08.923

HELP WHEN THERE IS JUST NOT

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:20.602
EVEN STAFF RIGHT AND SO I THINK

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.070
THAT WAS THE CASE IN THOSE

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:23.237
PARTICULAR FACILITIES THERE.

DISRESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO

ABOUT THOSE WORKERS. IT'S

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.128
REALLY IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.964
LOSE A COLEMAN'S- COMMENTS THAT

IT'S RESOURCES AND

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:13.334
ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN WE TALK

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.469
ABOUT THE RESOURCES. ONE OF ONE

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:17.238
OF THE SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:19.273
THE FACT THAT IF YOU HAVE THE

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.308

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:22.176
RECEIVING THESE COVERT POSITIVE

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:24.312
CO GOOD TO PATIENTS YOU RECEIVE

01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:27.748
EXTRA PAY. THE FACILITY DOES.

SEVERAL TIMES. I DON'T WANT TO

01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:26.827
DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:28.061
INFECTION PREVENTION AND

01:44:28.128 --> 01:44:29.663
CONTROL THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:32.399
ESSENTIAL. IN FACILITIES BUT I

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:33.767

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:35.202
YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE LATEST

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:36.203

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:39.840
AND FACILITIES. THE LATEST

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:41.208
RESEARCH FROM HARVARD FROM THE

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:43.910
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO- AND FROM

01:44:43.977 --> 01:44:45.612
BROWN. IT'S BASICALLY TELLING

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:46.913
US THAT THAT THAT THAT THE

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.749
THERE IS NOT. REALLY A LOT OF

01:44:48.815 --> 01:44:50.050
CORRELATION IN TERMS OF THE

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:52.085
QUALITY OF THE BUILDING. AND

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:53.286
THE QUALITY THE HISTORY OF THE

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.554
BUILDING IN TERMS OF ITS STAR

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:56.356
RATING. IT'S INFECTION

01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:58.592
PREVENTION OR ANY OF THAT. WHAT

01:44:58.659 --> 01:45:01.028
IS CORRELATED MORE TOWARD KOBE

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:02.896
IS THE INTENSITY OF COLD IN THE

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:04.965
COMMUNITY. THE SIZE OF THE

01:45:05.032 --> 01:45:07.434
BUILDING- AND THINGS MORE THAT

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:10.170
NATURE. SO IF YOU SEEN THE

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:11.471
FIRST WRESTLING AND I STATES

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.173
THAT HAD TO COPE WITH DEATH.

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.975
WAS A FIVE STAR FACILITY THAT

01:45:15.042 --> 01:45:16.376
HAS HAPPENED ALSO HERE IN

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:19.046
CALIFORNIA TO. SO I THINK THAT

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:20.714
THE AGAIN NOT TO DIMINISH THE

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:22.449
IMPORTANCE OF THOSE ISSUES.

01:45:22.516 --> 01:45:24.618

TESTING. THEY WERE ALL PRONE TO

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:32.559
THE SITUATION AS PER. I

01:45:32.626 --> 01:45:34.461
APPRECIATE THAT AND I DON'T

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:36.063
WANT TO BELIEVE IT THE POINT

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:40.600
BUT OBVIOUSLY. I WAS IN. THE TO

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:42.202
TIM THEN THE MINUTE I AM NOT

01:45:42.269 --> 01:45:48.308
WILL. AT WHICH- IS FIVE OR-

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:48.909
IT'S A MATTER OF HOW YOU RUN

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:49.543
THE FIRST. AND WHAT'S THEN YOU

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:51.645
INTO. THAT ENSURES THE SAFETY

01:45:51.712 --> 01:45:55.282
SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU EXCUSE

01:45:55.348 --> 01:45:57.084
ME CHAIR MAC MAC THIS IS LISA

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:58.552
COLEMAN IF I COULD RESPOND TO

01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:00.420
IT ALSO I'M I THINK PART OF

01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:01.621
THIS DISCUSSION WE ARE MISSING

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:04.458
A MAJOR COMPONENT AND THAT IS

01:46:04.524 --> 01:46:06.259
THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH A LARGE

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:09.096
PART OF THE FRUSTRATION AND

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:10.764
INCONSISTENCIES IN THE

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:12.032
BEGINNING THE SKILLED NURSING

01:46:12.099 --> 01:46:13.567
FACILITY WHAT A DIFFERENT

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:14.901
POSITION I DON'T THINK ANYONE

01:46:14.968 --> 01:46:17.270
WITH CALVET ACCEPT ONLY PERSONS

01:46:17.337 --> 01:46:18.605
THAT HAD NEGATIVE TESTING

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:21.174
EXCEPT PEOPLE WITH CUT- CITY

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:22.743
PERSON OUT BECAUSE THEY FELL

01:46:22.809 --> 01:46:24.177
DOWN BUT REQUIRE THAT THEY STAY

01:46:24.244 --> 01:46:25.746
IN THE HOSPITAL UNTIL THEY GET

01:46:25.812 --> 01:46:27.047
TO TEST TO PROVE THAT THEY

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:28.448
DON'T HAVE IT. IT WAS THAT WAS

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:30.784
THE INCONSISTENCY OF MESSAGING

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:32.252
THAT COSTS SO MUCH PROBLEM IN

01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:33.587
THE BEGINNING AND THAT GOES

01:46:33.653 --> 01:46:35.789
BACK TO MY LEGISLATIVE REQUEST

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:37.424
THOSE LOCAL PLANNING

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:40.727
ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO HAVE AN

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:45.966
EXPERT IN LONG TERM CARE. LOCAL.

01:46:46.032 --> 01:46:47.334
PUBLIC HEALTH. ARE INTIMATE

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.202
AWARE OF WHICH SKILLED OR THE-

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:53.240
HISTORICALLY STRUGGLES FROM.

01:46:53.306 --> 01:46:55.475
REGULATORY IN COMPLIANCE AND SO

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:56.877
WHEN A HOSPITAL IS JUST

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:59.012
CHARGING A CO THAT POSITIVE

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:01.148
PERSON TO A FACILITY. THAT THAT

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:02.415
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OF A

01:47:02.482 --> 01:47:03.817
DECISION THAT WAS MADE BY

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:05.952
EXPERTS OF FACILITY THE PUBLIC

01:47:06.019 --> 01:47:07.120
HEALTH AND THE OFFICE MANAGER

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:08.855
AT THE FACILITY RATHER THAN THE

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:09.956
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE

01:47:10.023 --> 01:47:11.858
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES.

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:13.326
AND ALSO ON THE FUNDING I

01:47:13.393 --> 01:47:14.661
WOULDN'T TO POINT OUT THAT

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:16.363
THERE IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON

01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:18.031
TOP OF THE 10% SKILLED NURSING

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.399
FACILITY INTEREST YOU'RE

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:20.867
LOOKING AT TO GET THIS COMING

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:23.603
BUDGET. ABC THIRTEEN TWENTY

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:24.404
NINE IS LOOKING TO GIVE THEM AN

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:26.973
ADDITIONAL NINETY TWO MILLION

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.375
IN GENERAL FUND. FOR QUALITY

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:30.310
CARE. AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE

01:47:30.377 --> 01:47:32.679
IS NOTHING IN THAT NINETY TWO

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.047
MILLION DOLLARS THAT SAYS THEY

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:36.049
HAVE TO PAY A LIVING WAGE. I AM

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:38.285
THRILLED TO HEAR. THAT

01:47:38.351 --> 01:47:38.852

CODE IS RAPID. AND THAT NINETY

01:47:46.426 --> 01:47:47.427
TWO MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE

01:47:47.494 --> 01:47:49.095
THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:52.799
PUT A LINK. TO STAFFING. FOR

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:54.701
THAT ADDITIONAL MONEY. THANK

IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT THERE

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:24.417
WAS NO COMMENT THERE WAS THERE

01:55:24.484 --> 01:55:26.319

THIS IN GENERAL ON YOUR ON THE

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:36.095
MASTER PLAN ON AGING AS WE'RE

01:55:36.162 --> 01:55:38.231
LOOKING AT THAT. TO EMPHASIZE

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:40.533
FLEXIBILITY FOR COMMUNITIES- MY

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.735
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE

01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:43.303
DISTRICT I REPRESENT DO NOT

01:55:43.369 --> 01:55:46.472
LOOK LIKE. LOS ANGELES- THEY

01:55:46.539 --> 01:55:48.308
DON'T LOOK LIKE- SAN FRANCISCO.

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:50.043
THERE SMALL RURAL AND OFTEN

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:52.011
HAVE A VERY LIMITED RESOURCES

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:53.646
AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE-

01:55:53.713 --> 01:55:54.847
LOOK AT THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:58.117
HAVE FLEXIBILITY- IN IN OUR IN

01:55:58.184 --> 01:56:00.353

REFERENCED THE IMPORT OF LONG

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:07.794
TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. BUT IT

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:09.128
WOULD OUT THAT IT WAS ALSO

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:10.730
SUBJECT TO A MAJOR BUDGET CUTS.

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:11.998
AND A AT A TIME WHEN I THINK WE

01:56:12.065 --> 01:56:14.701
NEED THAT THE MOST. AND THAT'S

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:16.269
THAT'S PRETTY PRETTY DOES HEART

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:18.538
AND SO. I DO HAVE A FINAL

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:21.808
QUESTION AND THAT IS IN AS FOR.

01:56:21.874 --> 01:56:27.580
MR CORNET. AND MOVE ON TO WORK.

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:29.082
WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR- PANEL.

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:31.584
PAMELA PAM QUESTIONS MISTER.

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:32.218
SAID THAT YOU WE WERE HAMPERED

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:33.286
BY A LATE START NASH.

01:56:33.353 --> 01:56:35.855
INTERNATIONALLY STATE- IF

01:56:35.922 --> 01:56:37.190
YOU'RE YOU'VE BEEN PLAGUED WITH

01:56:37.256 --> 01:56:41.461
INADEQUATE PP TESTING- I WOULD

01:56:41.527 --> 01:56:45.164
POINT OUT THAT- ABOUT 67% OF

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:45.998
RESIDENTS OF SKILLED NURSING

01:56:46.065 --> 01:56:48.368
FACILITIES ARE ARE MEDI CAL.

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:50.403
THEN ANOTHER 25230% ARE

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:53.072
MEDICARE- AND SO THERE ARE

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:54.273
THERE NOT A HUGE NUMBER OF

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:56.075
PRIVATE PAY. SO THE VAST

01:56:56.142 --> 01:56:58.478
MAJORITY OF INCOME TO SKILLED

01:56:58.544 --> 01:56:59.112
NURSING FACILITIES IS

01:56:59.178 --> 01:57:02.281
GOVERNMENT. AND WITH THAT-

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:04.217
SHOULD IS OVERSIGHT AND THAT'S

01:57:04.283 --> 01:57:07.387
WHY WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF

01:57:07.453 --> 01:57:08.254
PUBLIC HEALTH- SO INVOLVED IN

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:11.591
OVERSEE. I AM CONCERNED AND

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:14.160
FRUSTRATED THE FIRST OUTBREAKS

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:16.763

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:30.143
YOUR OWN PP AND I POINT THIS

01:57:30.209 --> 01:57:32.278
OUT BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:33.579
OF YOUR SKILLED NURSING

01:57:33.646 --> 01:57:37.049
FACILITIES ARE FOR PROFIT AND

01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:38.418
THEY'RE MAKING. A LOT OF MONEY.

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:41.354
SO WHEN DID YOU BEGIN TO CA

01:57:41.421 --> 01:57:43.489

DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPLIES- IT

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:27.493

THE MOST OF MOST IN MEDI CAL

02:00:17.009 --> 02:00:20.780
LEAST IS THE MOST. A GOVERNMENT

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:21.314
FUNDED OF ANY PART OF THE

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:22.949

SAME TIME. THE THIS CENSUS THE

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:35.828
CENSUS WAS COMING DOWN ON THE

02:00:35.895 --> 02:00:37.096
MEDICARE POPULATION BECAUSE

02:00:42.735 --> 02:00:44.737
ITSELF IS STILL THESE WERE EVEN

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:46.172
MORE SWEET FINANCE. I'D ALSO

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:47.607

EVEN HIT ANY OF FACILITIES AT

02:00:51.177 --> 02:00:51.677
THIS POINT NOT THAT'S OKAY

02:00:51.744 --> 02:00:52.578

INFORMATION AND THAT WAS

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:29.782
OBVIOUSLY DEVASTATING BECAUSE
