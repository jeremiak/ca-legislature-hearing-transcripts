00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:38.803
WE MEAN THAT TEN YEARS

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.405
PURCHASERS PUBLIC HEALTH

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:42.340
INSTITUTIONS SOCIAL SERVICE

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:44.209
AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS

00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:44.909
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND IN MOST

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:47.245
CASES EMERGENCY RESPONSE

00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:48.646
PROVIDERS AN AGENCY CAN'T

00:30:48.713 --> 00:30:51.549
PARTICIPATE IN MOST HIV

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:53.151
ACTIVITY. PART BECAUSE THEY

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:55.987
WERE DESIGNED. TO EXCHANGE

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:57.822
PHYSICAL HEALTH DATA. ALSO DUE

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:58.790
TO THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM

00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.858
DON'T HAVE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:02.860
IN PLACE WITH WHICH THEY CAN

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:05.496
SHARE DATA WITH OTHERS. THE

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:08.199
THIRD CATEGORY OF ISSUES IS- IS

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:10.168
REALLY A LEGAL ONE AND THIS IS

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:12.470
FOCUSED ON CLICK ON COMPLEX AND

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:13.338
RIGID EXCHANGE RULES AND

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:14.839
REGULATIONS. AND IN THIS CASE

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:16.174
THERE ARE MANY RESTRICTIVE

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:18.109
AMBIGUOUS AND THE LINE STATE

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:20.078
AND FEDERAL LAWS. THE RESULT IN

00:31:20.144 --> 00:31:22.280
MANY ORGANISATIONS ELECTING NOT

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:23.448
TO PARTICIPATE IN DATA EXCHANGE

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:25.483
ACTIVITIES GEARING LIABILITY

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.118
AND REALLY AMBIGUITY

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.720
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:30.989
AND ARE AND ARE NOT ALLOWED TO

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:32.657
EXCHANGE. SO THOSE ARE THE

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.425
THREE MAIN CATEGORIES OF ISSUES

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.194
WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND PURPORT

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:38.129
THROUGH. A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:39.364
AND RESEARCH EXTENSIVE RESEARCH

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.366
WE'VE DONE AND- I'M OVER MANY

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:44.335
YEARS- AND MANY OF THE OTHER

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:45.036
STATES THAT HAVE H. I.

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:47.105
INITIATIVE COMPLEX. OUR NEXT

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:54.779
LIKELY. NOW WE IN THIS REPORT

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.314
DESCRIBED FOR SCENARIO TO

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:58.616
REALLY HELP THE HUMAN AND- OF

00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:02.854
THIS. H. I. IN. AND WE NOTED

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.256
PER THE DE IMPACT IT'S- AND ARE

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:06.891
AMERICAN LATIN ACT NATIVE CAN

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.960
WHO BEEN PART HARD HIT BY THE

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:11.029
PANDEMIC. BUT DISPARITIES EXIST

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.897
BEYOND THE PANDEMIC AND THEY

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:14.232
EXISTED AND THEY PRE DATED AT

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:15.466
AND THE LIMITED H. I.

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:17.869
INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TODAY

00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:19.971
DOES NOT SERVE THEM WELL. NOW

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:22.607
BEFORE SCENARIOS REALLY TRIED

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:23.274
TO CREATE THIS SEARCH WITH

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:24.475
HUMAN PICTURE OF WHAT ACTUALLY

00:32:24.542 --> 00:32:26.244
HAPPENED TO AN INDIVIDUAL IN

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.478
NEED FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:29.714
WHEN THEY TRY TO SEEK SERVICES

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:30.315
WITH THE PROVIDERS TRY TO CARE

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:32.250
FOR THEM. I'M TO THE FORESTERS

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:34.419
ARE AS FOLLOWS FIRST DISASTER

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:35.987
BONTA PRIMARILY WE'RE REALLY

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:37.588
FOCUSING ON WALL PARTS BECAUSE

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:38.756
THEY BECOME INCREASINGLY

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:41.359
PRESENT AND- UNFORTUNATELY IT.

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:44.696
AN ANNUAL. EVENT IN CALIFORNIA.

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.097
AND RECENTLY THEY DISPLACED

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:47.765
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:49.701
OF BALLOTS OF RESIDENTS

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:51.135
EVACUATED AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES

00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:53.671
OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTIES. AND

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:55.740
WITHOUT THESE ROBUST DATA

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.775
EXCHANGE CAPABILITIES.

00:32:57.842 --> 00:32:59.177
EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:00.345
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE

00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:01.412
PROVIDERS HAVE THE COMPLETE

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:03.548
INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT NEEDS

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:04.749
WHEN A PATIENT ARRIVES IN THE

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.117
CLINICS ARE IN THE HOSPITAL

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:07.685
WE'RE SEEKING CARE AND THEY

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:09.420
HAVE UNLIMITED MEANS ELECTRONIC

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.688
ELECTRONICALLY SHARING WHAT

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:12.423
THEY DO NOW ONCE THEY ACTUALLY

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.193

AN RESPONSE- AND WORLD VERY OF

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:29.207
THE ISSUES HERE BUT JUST IN.

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:30.241
PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTIONS WE

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:32.543
SEE DATE HAVE ACCESS TO RE TIME.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.579

VACCINE AND OTHER INFORMATION

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:42.153
THAT NECESSARY TO RAPIDLY

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.322
MOBILIZE RESPONSES AND

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:46.624

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:49.394
OF REAL TIME ACCESS TO THAT

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.428
INFORMATION. I CAN'T LINK

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:52.697
RECORD THEY CAN'T SHOW FOR

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.165
EXAMPLE THAT SOMEBODY GOT THE

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:56.134

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.873
CAN RAPIDLY BE MOBILIZED TO

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:04.776
SUPPORT THEM. SO THEY CAN'T

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:06.744
LIKE THOSE RECORDS. PUBLIC

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:07.779
HEALTH CANNOT DEMOBILIZE

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.480
RESOURCES AND OTHER PROVIDERS

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:11.215
TO CARE FOR THAT NUMBER BASED

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:15.286
ON WHAT THEY'RE- A THIRD ISSUES

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:15.820
RUN CERTAIN PATIENTS WITH

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:16.721
COMPLEX NEEDS AND THIS IS

00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:18.856
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR-

00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:20.425
CALIFORNIA NOW IN IN LIGHT OF

00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:22.360
WHAT. WHAT CULT CAL AIM WHICH

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:23.928
IS THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:24.462
SERVICE PROGRAM WHICH IS

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.431
LAUNCHING NEXT YEAR. WHICH IS

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:28.132
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.168
ADDRESS THOSE. INDIVIDUALS

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:34.839
ENROLLED IN MEDICARE NOW- WE

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.507
HAVE A NUMBER OF. TECHNIQUE IN

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:39.043
A IF AN INNOCENT WE THE PAY

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.312
WITH NEEDS OFTEN HAVE CRY

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.613
MEDICAL CONDITION LIKE THAT OR

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.515
HEART COULD BEHAVIORAL AND

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:45.516
SOCIAL MEETING THEY HAVE A

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.385
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OR

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:48.419
SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:51.022
ILLNESS SOCIAL NEEDS LIKE

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:52.223
HOUSING INSECURITY. AND THE

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.458
NETWORK OF PROVIDERS THAT

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:54.926
CERTAIN HAVE NO WAY OF SHARING

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:56.861
VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT EACH

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.596
ONE OF THOSE FACTORS. SO THAT

00:34:58.663 --> 00:35:00.298
WHEN PROVIDERS ARE TRYING TO

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:02.400
CARE FOR THEM HELP THEM GET

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:03.634
HOUSING HELPED THEM GET IT BUT

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:05.036
REPORTER THE SUBSTANCE USE

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:07.438
DISORDER. IT'S INCREDIBLY

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:08.172
DIFFICULT ACCESS INFORMATION TO

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:09.974
DO THAT. AND THE RESULTANT

00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:11.275
UNCOORDINATED CARE AND

00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:13.578
INCREASED MORBIDITY AND

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:14.846
MORTALITY FOR THOSE NUMBERS.

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:16.380
FINALLY QUALITY REPORTING BY

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:19.450
BASED CARE. REPAIRS HELP PLANT

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:20.585
IN THE MEMBERS HAVE TO ACCESS

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:23.321
TO HELP INFORMATION SO. I NEED.

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:24.922
WHO IS TRYING TO FIND A

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:29.193
PROVIDER FOR. GLAUCOMA FOR- AN-

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.329
A CHRONIC DISEASE MAY NOT OR OR

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:32.830
A SURGERY PROCEDURE MAY NOT

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:34.565
HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT.

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:37.268
PROVIDERS AND THEIR OUTCOME HOW

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:38.503
WELL THEY PERFORM ON A

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:41.606
PARTICULAR SURGICAL PROCEDURE

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:42.874
HOW MUCH IT COSTS- AND SO THEY

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.342
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM

00:35:44.408 --> 00:35:45.510
CHOOSE THE PROVIDER THAT BEST

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:46.844
MEET THEIR NEEDS AND FOR A

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:48.579
HEALTH PLAN AND PURCHASERS TO

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:50.081
DEVELOP VALUE BASED. PAYMENT

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:51.415
PROGRAMS THAT ARE BASED ON

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:52.850
THINGS LIKE QUALITY BECAUSE

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:53.751
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:55.319
CLINICAL DATA. THEY CAN'T

00:35:55.386 --> 00:35:57.388
REALLY USE THAT TO DRIVE

00:35:57.455 --> 00:35:58.322
DECISIONS ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:01.893
ON OUR NETWORK. AND WHAT SHOULD

00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:04.428
THE BY THE- PAYMENT PROGRAMS BE

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:06.631
BASED ON. SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:07.632
THINGS THAT WE DESCRIBE IN OUR

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:10.268
IN OUR REPORT. AND THAT REALLY

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:12.770
HELPS- ILLUSTRATE THE IMPACT OF

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:15.139
THE HUMAN TOLL OF A LOCKING. H.

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:16.908
I. INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:18.876
OPTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO FALL

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:24.348
IN A MOMENT. NOT QUITE THE. SO

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:25.550
IN TERMS OF THE KEY ACTION

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:26.851
TAKEN THESE OPTIONS FOR

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:29.654
CONSIDERATION SO- CLEARLY WHEN

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.489
YOU CONSIDER THESE FOUR

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:33.224
SCENARIO THERE'S A COMPLEX

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:36.127
SENTENCE HIV CHALLENGES. THE

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:37.361
HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT GAPS

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:38.663
IN OUR INFORMATION EXCHANGE

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.431
CAPABILITIES AND I HAVE SERIOUS

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:42.199
IMPLICATIONS FOR RESIDENTS.

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.534
PROVIDERS TO CARE FOR THEM AND

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:45.303
THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCIES

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:47.605
TO COVER AND SUPPORT THEM. SO

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:49.373
AS I MENTIONED WE SUPPORTER

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.075
NUMBER STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:52.877
RESEARCH INTO A NUMBER OF

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:55.546
DIFFERENT STATE POLICIES. TO

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:57.148
HAVE SOME SOME WHICH HAVE

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:58.015
MARKED COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE

00:36:58.082 --> 00:37:02.119
HIV. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT-

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.121
THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:05.623
SERVICES- HIV STRUCTURE

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.658
SERVICES AND INITIATIVES ARE

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.994
BEST SUPPORTED WHEN THEY USE A

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:12.863
RANGE OF POLICY CONTRACTING AND

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.532

COORDINATED WAY. AND

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:19.971
SPECIFICALLY WE FOUND THAT

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:21.205
STATES THAT HAD MORE REQUIRE

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:23.341
HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THE

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:25.876
FOLLOWING COMPONENTS. ONE THE

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:26.811
BIGGEST DRAWBACK PUBLISHED A

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.846

ALL OF THE DATA WITHIN REASON I

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.978
MEAN THAT THERE OBVIOUSLY SOME

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:43.446
LIMITATIONS ON WHAT THE STATE

00:54:43.513 --> 00:54:44.681
CAN DO FOR AN ORIGINALLY

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:46.716

AND CLAIMS DATA I MEAN THAT'S

00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:02.832
REALY WHAT THEY HAVE AT THEIR

DISPOSAL DISPOSAL BY AND LARGE-

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:08.471
AND FOR- YOU KNOW THE PHARMACY

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:10.774
THAT. A CLAIM IS VERY MUCH LIKE

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.842
IT'S ALMOST. CLINICAL BECAUSE

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:14.678
IT DESCRIBES THE PRESCRIPTION

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.613
THAT WAS ACTUALLY DISPENSE. BUT

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.916
I'LL TELL YOU THAT THE PERSON.

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.217
MATT FOREMAN AND FOR YOU CAN

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:23.119
MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT WHAT THAT

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:25.055
INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WHO. SPENT

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:27.824
THAT DRUG HABIT YOU CAN'T. NOT

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.225
DETERMINE IT RIGHT DOESN'T MEAN

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:32.195
THEY HAVE DIABETES BUT IT'S

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:33.463
INFORMATION THAT IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.863
BUT IT'S BASICALLY

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.766
ADMINISTRATOR SO IT'S LIMITED

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:39.436
AND CAN HELP INFORM THINGS LIKE

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.471
THE VALUE OR THE PRICE THAT WAS

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:44.140
PAID FOR A SERVICE. BUT IT

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:45.542
GENERALLY CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:48.211
CLINICAL OUTCOMES. BOTH DATA

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.946
LIVE WITHIN ELECTRONIC HEALTH

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.015
RECORDS OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.983
RECORDS. AND SO YEAH PLAN

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.518
SHOULD ALL PLANS IDEALLY SHOULD

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.420
BE SHARING ADMINISTRATIVE DATA

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:59.389
LIKE CLAIM. BUT THEY ALSO

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:01.524
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO WITH THE

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:03.026
CLINIC RESTRICTIONS ABOUT HOW

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:05.228
THEY CAN USE THAT. CLINICAL

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:06.396
INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.431
UNDERSTAND WHO THE WHO THE HIGH

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:09.799
QUALITY PROVIDERS ARE WHO THEY

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.835
MAY WANT HAPPEN THOSE NETWORKS

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:13.803
BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOOD OUTCOME.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.438
WHAT THE COST OF THE SERVICES

00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:17.507
ARE THAT THEY GET- THAT THEY

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:19.375
PAY FOR. THAT YOU WE CAN

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:22.912
ACTUALLY. BEND THE COST CURVE.

00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:24.881
THAT'S GREAT. SO YOU'VE YOU'VE

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:26.416
BEEN YOU'VE BEEN A STUDENT THIS

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:28.618
FOR MANY MANY YEARS SO- THEN

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:30.553
THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.822
INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE-

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.491
THERE ARE H. I. EASE THAT ARE

00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:36.326
OPERATING OUT THERE BUT THEY'RE

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:37.060
NOT THEY'RE NOT TERRIBLY

00:56:37.127 --> 00:56:39.229
LINKED. I THINK THERE THERE ARE

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:40.697
SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO FEEL

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.732
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD STUDY THE

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:44.634
NEED FOR THIS YOU KNOW THIS

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.936
THIS GOING FORWARD RATHER THAN

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:49.539
ACTUALLY MOVING ON SOMETHING- I

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:51.274
GUESS I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:53.443
YOU'RE PROBABLY YOU'VE STUDIED

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.211
THIS FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS.

00:56:55.278 --> 00:56:56.346
DO YOU THINK WE REALLY NEED

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:59.582
ANOTHER STUDY OR SHOULD WE BE

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:00.150
MOVING ON SOMETHING AT THIS

00:57:00.216 --> 00:57:04.220
POINT. IN YOUR OPINION ALL. IN

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:06.322
MY OPINION WE START YEAH WE'VE

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:09.259
DONE WE'VE STUDIED THE ISSUE.

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:12.262
BUT I MEAN WE KNOW EVERYTHING-

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:13.730
I THINK THE TIME FOR ACTION IS

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:16.299
NOW I THERE'S IN MY MIND

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:20.170
THERE'S NO NEED TO WAIT AND

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:22.372
STUDY THE PROBLEM ANY LONGER.

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:24.541
BUT WHAT REALLY IS NECESSARY AS

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.876
PART OF THIS PROCESS. IS TO

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:30.046
HAVE A REALLY CLEAR SET OF

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:31.648
GOALS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:33.917
TOWARDS. AND THAT REALLY NEED

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.451
TO COME FROM THE STATE. THEY

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:37.720
NEED TO HAVE AN ARTICULATED

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:39.722
POINT OF VIEW ABOUT WHAT KIND

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:40.924
OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.959
ACTIVITIES WE WANT TO SUPPORT

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:46.196
TO ENABLE SPECIFIC STATE GOAL.

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:47.630
THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.933
OF TIME FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO ALL

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:50.667
FOR THE STATE AND STAKEHOLDERS

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:52.168
TO REALLY SORT OF MAKE THAT

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:55.238
PROCLAMATION. AND WHEN THEY'RE

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.507
GOING THROUGH THAT SORT OF THAT

00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:01.845
INTERNAL ANALYSIS AND THAT- AND

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.546
ADVANCING RECOMMENDATION. YES

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:04.614
THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHAT

00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:05.715
OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AND WHAT

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:07.350
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE. TO

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:10.119
BE SUCCESSFUL AND HOW THEY'RE

00:58:10.186 --> 00:58:11.120
EXCHANGING INFORMATION TO

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:14.057
ADVANCE. POLICY AND PROGRAM

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:15.992
GOALS. SO WE SHOULD NEVER STOP

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.794
STUDYING THE ISSUE BECAUSE YOU

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:19.963
CAN ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING. BUT

00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:21.164
I THINK GENERALLY WE HAVE A

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:22.198
PRETTY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:23.900
WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE NOW

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.568
THEY'RE BIG GAPS IN PHYSICAL

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:27.670
HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE WE

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:28.571
NEED TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS WE

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:30.039
NEED. THIS FINANCING IF

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:32.208
NECESSARY. AND THERE MAY BE

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:33.910
NEED TO BE POLICY AND

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:36.446
REGULATORY THINGS LIKE MANDATE.

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:37.981
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:40.250
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. INFORMATION

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:42.385
EXCHANGE WITH CLINICAL DATA AND

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:43.720
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:45.521
POLICIES TO ENABLE TO DO THAT.

00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:46.689
WE KNOW THERE IS A NEED TO

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:48.558
ACCESS SOCIAL SERVICE DATA LIKE

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:51.761
HOUSING. INFORMATION AND THAT

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:53.463
THERE'S A NEED FOR CAPACITY FOR

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:55.231
INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP SUPPORT

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:56.532
AND MAKE THE BRIDGE BETWEEN

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:58.067
HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

00:58:58.134 --> 00:58:59.969
SYSTEM. AND ELECTRONIC HEALTH

00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:02.538
RECORD. IT CAN BE DONE WE'VE

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:04.073
SEEN IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THERE

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.675
ARE GOOD STUDIES THAT HAVE

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:07.477
SHOWN HOW IT CAN BE DONE AS

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:09.679
BEST PRACTICES. IT'S REALLY

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:10.413
TIME AT THIS POINT

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.715
IMPLEMENTABLE AND TO PRIORITIZE

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:15.752
THAT WE CAN- THE QUINT. AND

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:19.956
INTERNET. SO I'M THINKING AHEAD

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:22.759
A LITTLE BIT SO IF WE HAD. A

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:25.028
ROBUST SORT OF CENTRALIZED

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:25.528
STATE HEALTH INFORMATION

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:27.931
EXCHANGE. I JUST THINK ABOUT

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:29.933
THE VALUE POTENTIAL VALUE OF

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:31.834
THAT IN THE COVIDIEN COVERT FOR

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.603
EXAMPLE THERE IS A GREAT

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:35.004
INTERVIEW ON NPR RECENTLY THAT

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:36.339
I LISTEN TO THAT TALKED ABOUT

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:38.775
THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE EFFICACY

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:41.978
OF THE CODE NINETEEN VACCINE

00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:43.346
FOR THE LONG HAUL WE DON'T KNOW

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:45.148
THAT. BUT IF WE HAD INTO IT WE

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:48.051
HAD A WAY TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:49.252
THAT DATA S IF WE KNEW THE

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:51.988
PATIENT. CONTRACTED IT LATER

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:54.524
ON- WE COULD BE DOING SOME OF

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:56.926
THESE HEALTH POPULATION STUDIES

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:58.194
TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT WE

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.329
CAN'T DO THAT NOW BECAUSE THE

00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.763
SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:05.568
FRAGMENTED- AND THAT'S- LAST

01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:07.804
NIGHT I WAS ON A CALL-

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.605
REGARDING. WITH WITH OUR

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:13.643
ADMINISTRATION- REGARDING-

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.812
ISSUES AROUND COVE IT. AND ONE

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.914
OF THE THINGS THAT WE ASKED OF

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.515
THE STATE IS YOU KNOW CAN YOU

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:22.785
TELL US- HOW MANY YOU KNOW IN

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:26.089
STATEWIDE AND IN EVERY COUNTY

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:28.091
YOU KNOW- BREAKDOWN OF THE

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:30.159
NUMBER OF CASES THE NUMBER OF

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:32.628
VACCINES THAN THE ETHNICITY OF

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:34.497
WHO'S GETTING THEM IN. AND THE

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:37.500
ANSWER WAS NOT REALLY WE DON'T

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.569
HAVE WE CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT WE

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:42.138
CAN'T EASILY DO THAT WE CAN DO

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.240
IT BUT IT REQUIRES LOTS OF

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.575
PAPER AND LOTS OF LOTS OF

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.777
COORDINATION BUT BUT WITH THE

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.145
HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE WE

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:50.747
COULD PROBABLY DO THAT WITH

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:53.383
WITH WITH QUERIES AND NOT A TO

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:56.285
DO. TOO DIFFICULT WAY IF IT

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:59.355
WAS. PUT TOGETHER RIGHT. RIGHT

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:01.057
THERE THE BUT PUBLIC HEALTH

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:04.127
INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT CALIFORNIA

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:06.629
HAVE TODAY LIKE CAL READY AND

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:08.631
CARE FOR NOT DESIGNED FOR A

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:12.335
GLOBAL PANDEMIC- AND IT AND

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.504
IT'S CLEAR YOU KNOW THE- IT WAS

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.205
SO CAL READY WAS NOT ABLE TO

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:17.607
HANDLE JUST THE VOLUME THE

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.909
SHEER VOLUME OF DATA. FOR EVERY

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.944
RESIDENT IN THE STATE TO GET

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.281
TAX ON A ROUTINE BASIS THE CAP

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.349
THAT CAPACITY DID NOT OCCUR.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:27.316
CARE WHICH IS THE SET OF

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:29.318
IMMUNIZATION REGISTRIES WAS

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.120
REALLY DESIGNED. FOR PEDIATRIC

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.388
MOSTLY FOR PEDIATRIC

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:34.490
IMMUNIZATION NOT. AS A

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:38.461
REPOSITORY FOR AND FOR AND FOR.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.796
OUR SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:41.764
VACCINATE EVERY SINGLE RESIDENT

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.766
AND HELP TRACKING REPORT ALL OF

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:44.967
THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S BACK

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.102
ACTUALLY DOING A FAIRLY GOOD

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.603
JOB WITH THINGS LIKE INVENTORY

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:49.472
MANAGEMENT NOT PERFECT. THERE

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:52.241
ARE SOME INTERFACES WITH THE HR

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:52.842
SO SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY KIND

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:55.111
OF WORKS- AND YOU GOTTA GIVE

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.779
HIM CREDIT- THEY DON'T GET A

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:57.747
LOT OF IT BUT YOU GOT TO GIVE

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:59.015
SOME CREDIT TO THEM. BUT THE

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.783
PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS WHO HAVE

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.086
BEEN FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:06.422
WORKING TIRELESSLY. NOW WHAT

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.157
DATE WHAT ISN'T HAPPENING. WHAT

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:11.461
YOU MENTIONED. WE DO NOT HAVE

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:13.796
THE ABILITY TO LINK A RECORD I

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.565
THINK THE PUBLIC HEALTH HAS ON

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.533
A POSITIVE TAX OR EVEN A

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.102
VACCINE LET'S JUST SAY A

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:21.237
POSITIVE TAX. EFFECT OF THAT

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:23.239
PERSON ARE THEY A MEDIC CAL DO

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:25.675
THEY GET FOOD STAMPS DO THEY

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.510
ARE THEY HOMELESS. THAT

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.279
INTEGRATION OF DATA. THAT BACK

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:33.749
BACK BY LOAD DATA. IT DOES NOT

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.351
ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.353
PROVIDERS WHO SERVE THE

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.654
INDIVIDUAL WHO JUST GOT TESTED

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:41.390
POSITIVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:42.258
THE VIRUS THE CAUGHT COVER

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.527
NINETEEN. THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.696
DATA LINKED TOGETHER AND A WAY

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:48.431
TO. IDENTIFY THE TO THEY CAN

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.166
IMMEDIATELY RESPOND AND SAY

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.434
OKAY WE KNOW THIS INDIVIDUALS

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.236
ON MEDICAID. WE KNOW WHAT THOSE

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:54.937
BENEFITS ARE WE CAN MOBILIZE

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.739
THOSE MEDICAL SERVICES TO THAT

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.708
INDIVIDUAL. WE KNOW THAT THEY

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.676
HAVE DATE THAT THEY'RE ON FOOD

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.845
STAMPS. WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.780
GOING TO LIKELY HAVE PRUDENT

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.549
SECURITY SO WE NEED TO MOBILIZE

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.317
FOOD TO THEIR PRESIDENT BECAUSE

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:12.255
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE T BE-

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:15.324
ISOLATING FOR TWO WEEKS- OUR IF

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.025
THEY'RE UNEMPLOYED THAT THEY

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:17.193
DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A PAYCHECK

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.594
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.196
SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME-

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:22.098
FURTHER YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.934
THAT CAPABILITY AND IF WE WERE

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:25.434
JUST. AND IF WE WERE TO

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:27.670
PRIORITIZE. THE ABILITY FOR

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.772
SYSTEMS TO SHARE INFORMATION

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.874
WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND- PUBLIC

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.776
HEALTH THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.144
ALONG WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:37.313
TO MARRY THOSE DATA. ORDER THE

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.915
LONGITUDINAL TYPE OF STUDY SO

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.082
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PHOEBE

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:41.450
AFRICA THE LIKE YOU'RE STAYING

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.219
FOR LONG HAULERS. WE HAVE A

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:44.787
BETTER PICTURE OF HOW TO

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:47.323
RESPOND AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.025
COVERED IT'S BEEN FOR SOME OF

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:51.127
THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE.

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:53.496
ADVERSELY IMPACTED. I ALSO

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:56.265
CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT OUR

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:57.767
OUR ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO

01:03:57.833 --> 01:04:00.369
ACCESS VACCINES AND TESTING.

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.038
WOULDN'T BE DRAMATICALLY

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:04.273
IMPROVED IF YOUR PROVIDER.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.375
COULD QUERIA SYSTEM AND SAY.

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.577
AND LOOK AT ALL THE VACCINE

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:09.679
AVAILABILITY OR ALL THE TESTING

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:11.681
AVAILABILITY AND MATCH YOU UP

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:12.848
IT WOULD PREVENT YOU AS THE

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:15.084
CONSUMER FROM HAVING TO MAKE

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:17.153
CALL AFTER CALL AFTER CALL. OR

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.821
SPENT HOURS AT A COMPUTER

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:19.755
TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE AN

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:21.557
APPOINTMENT TO GET A VACCINE.

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:23.392
OR OR WHATEVER IF WE HAD THE

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:24.894
ABILITY TO SYNTHESIZE THIS

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.762
INFORMATION IN A WAY. THE

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:29.031
OUTCOME IN AND OF AND THE USER

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:29.932
EXPERIENCE WOULD BE GREATLY

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:34.971
ENHANCED- I THINK. IT CERTAINLY

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:37.273
WHAT. WE'RE EXPERIENCING THAT

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.174
NOW IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.243
ACCESS TO VACCINES FOR

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.911
TEACHERS. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.346
WHERE'S THE DOOR IF I CAN FIND

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:44.714
UP AND GET BACK TO ME THAT

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.515
THOUGH. WE CAN GET OUR KIDS TO

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:48.317
SCHOOL BUT BACK IN THE SCHOOL

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:51.354
MORE MORE RAPIDLY. WORK THAT

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.655
ANY TEACHER HOW CAN TELL YOU

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:53.489
WE'RE GOING TO THAT PROCESS

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:56.292
RIGHT NOW AND IT AND IT IS

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:57.526
CHALLENGING. WE DON'T HAVE WE

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.995
DID NOT DESIGN THE

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.329
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.498
TODAY. AND ALL THAT- SO

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.467
ABSOLUTELY THAT IS. THAT'S ONE

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:07.436
OF THE OUTCOMES OF NOT HAVING.

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:07.937
WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:10.539
SUPPORT. ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:13.142
IN GETTING- BACK TO BACK WINS

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:16.045
UNDERSTANDING APPLY CHAIN AND-

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:16.646
ALL THE CAPITA ISSUES YOU JUST

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:18.781
MENTIONED. THANK YOU I'M I

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.650
THINK DECEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY HAD

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:24.587
A QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.255
PRESENTATION AND UNFORTUNATELY

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:27.256
I DON'T HAVE THE BEST HEARING

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:29.191
IN THIS ROOM IS REALLY ACCURATE

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:31.360
SO I APOLOGIZE BUT THERE'S YOU

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.695
KNOW SOMETHING THAT KIND OF I

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:34.196
JUST WANT YOU TO SEE IF YOU TO

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.498
DRESS AND YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:37.266
IN THE PRESENTATION BUT- YOU

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.401
KNOW I HAVE A CONCERN OF HOW

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:40.202
WELL THE EXCHANGE OF HEALTH

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:42.972
INFORMATION CALIFORNIA EVER A

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:49.545
LINE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.414
YEAH I MEAN I THERE IS SO

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.583
CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY COMPLEX.

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:58.454
WEB- NIELSEN POLICIES- PRIVACY

01:05:58.521 --> 01:05:59.722
AND SECURITY POLICIES AND SOME

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:02.024
OF THEM- SOMEONE DO CONFLICT

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:05.394
WITH FEDERAL LAW- AND I- HI I

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.129
DON'T THINK THEY'LL EVER. IN MY

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:08.431
LIFETIME AT LEAST COMPLETELY

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:10.132
HARMONIZE MEANING THAT. WE ARE

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:11.934
JUST GOING TO DISCARD OUR LAW

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:13.202
THEY WERE PLANNING TO FEDERAL

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:15.304
LAW. THERE ARE AND THERE THERE

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:17.073
MAY BE VERY GOOD REASONS FOR-

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.708
AND RATIONALES FOR WHY CERTAIN

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:20.509
POLICIES LIKE HIV I THINK

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.278
THERE'S VERY GOOD REASON WHY.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:26.549
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AROUND.

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:27.149
SHARING DATA WITHOUT INFORMED

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:28.417
CONSENT. I AND THERE. SO WE MAY

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.152
NEVER GET TO A POINT WHERE WE

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:31.854
ARE COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:34.724
FEDERAL POLICY. WHAT'S REALLY

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.325
IMPORTANT I THINK FOR US TO

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:39.595
MEANINGFULLY. ENGAGE IN DATA

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:42.098
EXCHANGE IT FOR THE STATE TO GO

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:42.998
THROUGH A PROCESS OF

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.333
IDENTIFYING WHAT WHO DON'T

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.370
ALIGN. AND SHOULD WE TRY TO

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.839
AMEND. BECAUSE I THERE'S NO

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.006
RATIONAL OR THE RATIONALE DOES

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:52.408
NOT SUIT THE CURRENT DATE

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.677
MEANS. THE MADE INTERNATIONAL

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.612
TWENTY YEARS AGO. OR EVEN TEN

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.214
YEARS AGO BUT TODAY THE

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.082
RATIONALES CHANGED OR THE

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.184
SYSTEMS OF CHANGE TO OVERCOME.

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:05.521
THE REASON WHY THE POLICY WAS

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.390
CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:07.990
GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS PROCESS

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:10.893
OF. REVIEWING ALL OF THOSE

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.796
RULES AROUND CALIFORNIA DATA

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.699
PRIVACY AND SECURITY. AND WE

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.601
IDENTIFY THOSE POLICIES THAT WE

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.603
THINK SHOULD BE CHANGED OR

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:21.570
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE COULD BE

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:24.039
REVIVED WHAT WOULD BE LEFT WITH

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:25.975
OUR SET THE POLICY THAT WE

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.576
COLLECTIVELY AGREE. SHOULD

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.645
REMAIN THAT DIFFER FROM FEDERAL

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:33.249
POLICY. AND IN THAT CONTEXT YOU

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:36.552
CONSTRUCT A CONSENT THAT THAT

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:38.387
THAT DOCUMENT THAT BASICALLY

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:40.356
CALL THOSE POLICIES OUT THERE

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:43.359
WE RECOGNIZED THAT THEY EXIST

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:43.893
BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT WITH

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.828
FEDERAL POLICY. IF WE INFORM

UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR DATA CAN

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.470
BE USED. THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.138
AS WE CAN DOAND IF WE CAN

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:57.673

ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE DATA

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:16.111

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:18.614
PLEASURE TO SEE YOU ALL- BIG

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.215
COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:21.850
REALLY SHINE A LIGHT ON THE

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.819
NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THAT EXIST

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:24.353
THROUGHOUT THE HEALTHCARE

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.855
DELIVERY SYSTEM- I WAS THE

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:28.824
FIRST QUESTION A LITTLE ALLUDES

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.092
TO WHICH IS HOW CAN CALIFORNIA

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:31.894
DEVELOP WAY EACH ID POLICY THAT

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.395
BEST SUPPORTS THE STATE AND

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:35.364
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:36.231
AND EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO THE

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:37.433
CURRENT AND FUTURE A PUBLIC

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:39.568
HEALTH EMERGENCY. THE CHRONIC

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:40.903
UNDERFUNDING OF OUR PUBLIC

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.104
HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE HAS

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:44.073
MANIFESTED ITSELF DURING THE

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:45.874
PANDEMIC RESPONSE IN NUMBER OF

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:49.011
WAYS- FROM THE FAILURES OF THAT

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:50.846
CALTRAIN THE SYSTEM TO THE

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.849
DIFFICULTIES OF THE VACCINE

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:54.583
DISTRIBUTION AND TRACKING. ONE

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:56.318
OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:57.586
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IS BY

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.788
ENSURING THAT WE ARE COLLECTING

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.890
AND SHARING DATA AT SCALE-

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.525
HOWEVER RIGHT NOW I SEE ARE YOU

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.094
MEMBERS ARE STILL USING FAX

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.595
MACHINES TO SHARE PATIENT

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.564
RECORDS. CALIFORNIA MUST DO

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:10.899
BETTER. S. CI YOU BELIEVE THAT

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:12.668
IN ORDER FOR THE STATE O SHARE

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:14.703
DATA AT SCALE WE MUST HAVE

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:17.172
BROAD PARTICIPATION. WITHOUT A

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.108
MANDATE IN PLACE THERE ARE A TO

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:21.610
MANY REASONS FOR- HOSPITALS AND

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:23.212
HEALTH PLANS TO NOT SHARE THE

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:25.581
DATA UNIVERSALLY. SO WE WIND UP

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:27.549
WITH THAT INADEQUATE PATCHWORK

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.752
OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:32.588
TODAY. FOR US WE KNOW

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.189
INFORMATION IS POWER FRONT LINE

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:35.324
HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO HAVE

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.759
BEEN WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:39.028
OF THE PANDEMIC SINCE DAY ONE-

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:41.230
COULD UTILIZE HIV TO MAKE

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:42.498
CERTAIN THE HEALTH CARE TEAMS

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:43.799
UP ACCURATE REAL TIME

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.601
INFORMATION. ABOUT THEIR

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:48.237
PATIENTS. A STATE Y. H. I. E.

01:11:48.303 --> 01:11:50.406
NEEDS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.274
PROVIDERS. OF BURST AND

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:54.243
COMPREHENSIVE UNIFIED RECORD SO

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:56.845
CARE TEAMS CAN- CAN KNOW AS

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:59.048
MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT EVERY

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:01.283
SITUATION THEY'RE WALKING INTO.

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.851
IF A PATIENT COMES INTO ANY

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.753
HEALTHCARE SETTING OUR CARE

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.022
TEAM MEMBERS DESERVE TO KNOW IF

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:08.457
THAT PATIENTS TESTED POSITIVE

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:10.426
FOR COKE WITH NINETEEN. SO THAT

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:14.129
ARE. SO THAT PROPER PRECAUTIONS

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:15.698
CAN BE TAKEN. FRONTLINE WORKERS

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.900
NEED TO KNOW THEIR PATIENTS AND

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:18.801
PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:20.969
MUST HAVE READILY AVAILABLE

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:24.306
DATA. ON HANDS THAT SO THEY CAN

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.175
DO THEIR JOBS MORE EFFECTIVELY.

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:28.844
IN HEALTHCARE GAPS IN PATIENT

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:31.346
DATA HAVE- CAN HAVE DISASTROUS

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:32.981
IMPACTS ESPECIALLY DURING AN

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:35.350
EMERGENCY. EVERY GAP IN DATA

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.685
MAKES IT HARDER FOR SEIU

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:38.420
MEMBERS ARE FRONTLINE WORKERS

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:40.823
TO DO THEIR JOB. AND MANY OTHER

01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:42.391
STATES HAVE SHOWN THE ABILITY

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.193
FOR H. ID'S TO SUPPORT THEIR

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:47.096
PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES IN

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:48.964
CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOLLOW SUIT.

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.566
I'M IN WITH REGARD TO THE

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:53.302
SECOND QUESTION ABOUT HOW- ANY

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:55.771
SHOW YOU CAN UTILIZE THAT TO

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:56.739
HELP THE STATE DIDN'T FIND

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:58.040
BEGIN TO ELIMINATE HEALTH

01:12:58.107 --> 01:12:59.742
DISPARITIES YOU THINK THIS IS

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:00.676
ONE OF THE MOST IN QUEST

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:01.677
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ON THE

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.146
PANEL- AS WE HAVE SEEN DURING

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.415
THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE OF COLOR-

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:07.416
IN THOSE AND DISADVANTAGED

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.017
COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY BEARING

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:10.519
THE BRUNT OF THIS PANDEMIC AND

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:12.354
FRANKLY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.456
THAT- WE EVEN HAVE ACCURATE

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.492
SENSE OF HOW BAD THINGS REALLY

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:18.927
ARE. YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO MAKE A

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:21.029
GOOD FAITH GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:22.164
ADDRESS HEALTH CARE INEQUITIES

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.232
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TRUE

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:25.134
PICTURE OF WHERE THE EXISTING

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.136
HOW PROFOUND THEY ARE. S. YEAH

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.570
YOU BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT A

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:31.273
ROBUST STATE WHITE EACH IT CAN

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.941
HELP THE STATE MOVE THE NEEDLE

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:34.843
ON EQUITY. AND THERE ARE

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.913
SEVERAL THINGS WE MUST CONSIDER

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.314
AS THIS POLICY AND FINANCES.

HEALTHCARE SERVICES HEALTH

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:42.484
INSURERS AND PROVIDERS MUST BE

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.586
REQUIRED TO COLLECT RACE AND

BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. WE

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.676
SHOULD REQUIRE THE STATEY. H.

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.344

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:04.660
A LONG STANDING ISSUE AS IT

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.520
CONDITIONS TO ENCOURAGE THOSE

AND GET THESE PATIENTS IN TO

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:42.657
GET THEIR VACCINE SO WE WENT

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:45.827

DAYS WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.846
INFORMATION AND THEN WE WERE

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:06.481
ABLE TO THROUGH THE PUBLIC

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:08.083
HEALTH SYSTEM CONTACT THOSE

THEIR VACCINE WITHOUT A ROBUST

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:19.894
H. I EAT- WE WOULD NEVER BE

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:20.495
ABLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF PUBLIC

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:25.367
HEALTH. SO HAVE- IN- HOW CAN WE

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:26.735
REPLICATE THIS FOR ALL OF

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:29.204
CALIFORNIA WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.738
TO ACCOMPLISH HERE IN THE

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:31.639
INLAND EMPIRE HERE'S WHAT I

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:34.409
WOULD DO NEARLY A 100% OF THE

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:37.045
HOSPITALS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:38.046
FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR H. I.

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:41.049
E. PARTICIPATION REALLY SPED UP

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:43.718
WHEN OUR LARGEST- LOCAL HEALTH

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:45.754
PLAN ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.288
INCENTIVES FOR H. I EAT

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:50.058
PARTICIPATION AND DATA SHARING.

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.260
TO GET UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.162
WE WILL NEED TO BUILD BUILD ON

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:57.832
SUCCESSFUL MODELS LIKE THE ONE

01:23:57.899 --> 01:23:58.466
WE DEVELOPED HERE IN THE INLAND

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:00.568
EMPIRE. A STATE WIDE H. I. E.

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.270
NEEDS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:04.706
DATA AND TOOLS FOR PRACTICES

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:07.475
WHICH DOES INCLUDE ALERTS SO

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:10.278
ALERTS MEANS- WHEN A PATIENT IS

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:12.380
ADMITTED- OR GO TO THE

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:14.716
EMERGENCY ROOM OR IS DISCHARGED

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:17.619
FROM THE HOSPITAL. TO MAKE SURE

01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:18.119
THAT THEIR PRIMARY CARE

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:20.688
PHYSICIAN KNOWS ABOUT THAT IF

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:21.923
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN THE

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.825
HOSPITAL AND THAT THEY'RE ABLE

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.027
TO GET THEIR PATIENTS IN IN A

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:28.863
TIMELY MANNER TO PROVIDE FOLLOW

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:29.330
UP CARE SO THEY'RE NOT

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.766
READMITTED. ALSO ANALYTICS

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.134
TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:35.170
RUN POPULATION HEALTH TYPE OF

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:37.071
REPORTS ON ALL OF THEIR

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:39.941
PATIENTS NOT JUST A ONE ON ONE

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.843
BASIS. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.279
NEED COMPREHENSIVE UNIFIED

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:46.047
RECORDS THAT CONTAINS ALL THE

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:49.684
pMATTER WHERE THAT PATIENT

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:52.654
RECEIVES THEIR CARE. AND LASTLY

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.923
HIV ACCESS SHOULD BE FREE WE

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.858
ARE VERY LOW LOW COST FOR SMALL

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:59.093
PRACTICES SMALL PRACTICES

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.263
CANNOT ABSORB LARGE IT AND-

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:05.333
CLASS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.968
INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS.

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:08.903
THE NEXT QUESTION HOW CAN H. I.

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:10.672
E. BE UTILIZED TO HELP THE

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:13.575
STATE IDENTIFY AND BEGIN TO

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:15.577
ELIMINATE HEALTH DISPARITIES

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:17.779
THAT CONTINUE TO IMPACT FAR TOO

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:20.114
MANY CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:22.050
CAN I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:23.351
THE CRITICAL ROLE OF SMALL

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:25.820
PRACTICES AND MAKING SURE EVERY

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:27.755
PERSON IN CALIFORNIA HAS

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:29.624
EQUITABLE ACCESS TO NEEDED

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:31.259
HEALTH CARE INCLUDING THE

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:33.795
VACCINES. ONE OF THE TRENDS WE

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:35.497
ARE SEEING IS THAT COVERT

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:37.131
ACCION'S ARE BEING DELIVERED

01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:39.567
OUT MARCH COMMUNITY SITES NOT A

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.870
PHYSICIAN OFFICES. THIS MEANS

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:43.771
THAT PRACTICES ARE COMPLETELY

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.540
IN THE DARK ABOUT THEIR

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:47.542
PATIENTS JACKSON NATION STATUS

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:49.077
DOCTORS CAN LOOK AT PATIENTS

01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:51.079
VACCINATION STATUS ONE OTHER

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:52.981
TIME OF THE VACCINATION

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:54.949
REGISTRY BUT FOR OBVIOUS

01:25:55.016 --> 01:26:00.021
REASONS THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE-

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:01.289
FOR BUSY PRACTICES. I'M REALLY

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:02.690
EXCITED ABOUT THE MODEL IN

01:26:02.757 --> 01:26:04.626
MARYLAND WHERE THE H. I. E.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.694
PROVIDES DAILY VACCINATION

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:09.297
REPORT SEGMENTED BY AGE RACE

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.599
AND GEOGRAPHY TO PROVIDERS

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.668
ACROSS THE STATE. THE H. I. E.

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:15.303
RECEIVES A DAILY VACCINATION

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:17.138
DATA FILE FROM THE STATE

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.440
REGISTRY AND THEN MATCHES IT UP

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.142
WITH THE PATIENT LESS HE H. I.

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.710
E. ALREADY HAS FOR EACH

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:25.013
PROVIDER. PROVIDERS GET A DAILY

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:27.148
REPORT OF ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:29.851
VACCINATION STATUS. ADDRESSING

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:31.252
DISPARITIES WILL TAKE A LOT OF

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:33.388
PROACTIVE OUTREACH FROM TRUSTED

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:35.957
ADVISORS THOSE TRUSTED ADVISORS

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:39.761
ARE ARE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:41.996
PROVIDERS. ROW AFTER ROW REJECT

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:43.431
THEM POSSIBLE WITHOUT

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:45.333
INFORMATION AND THE INSIDE

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.302
PROVIDERS NEED UNIFIED RECORDS

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.170
THAT COMBINE INFORMATION FROM A

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:51.339
PATIENT'S HEALTH PLAN AND ALL

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:53.141
OF THEIR PROVIDERS NO MATTER

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:54.809
WHERE THEY SEEK THEIR CARE.

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.477
THEY NEED TOOLS TO IDENTIFY

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:59.380
SUBSETS OF THEIR PATIENTS BASED

01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:02.050
ON RACE GEOGRAPHY AND THAT

01:27:02.116 --> 01:27:04.919
PREVENTED IT NEEDS VACCINATION

01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:06.988
STATUS. ALL THE INFORMATION

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.289
ORGANIZATIONS CAN PROVIDE

01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:10.692
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURETO MEET

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:13.528
THESE NEEDS THE STATE WIDE H.

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:14.662
I. E. SHOULD BE THE PLATFORM

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:16.264
THAT COMBINES CLAIMS AND

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:18.533
CLINICAL DATA TO PRODUCE A

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.435
UNIFIED VIEW OF PATIENTS

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:22.437
HEALTH. AND PROVIDE ANALYTIC

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.572
TOOLS TO SUPPORT PROACTIVE

01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:28.009
OUTREACH AND POPULATION HEALTH.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:30.244
THE NEXT QUESTION WHAT IS THE

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:31.980
BEST WAY TO ESTABLISH DATA

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:33.881
EXCHANGE ACROSS HEALTHCARE AND

01:27:33.948 --> 01:27:35.783
SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ENABLES

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.785
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

01:27:37.852 --> 01:27:39.821
AND PATIENT CENTERED CARE

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:43.725
COORDINATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:45.426
LAY OUT A STRATEGY FOR EXCHANGE

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:47.962
ACROSS A PHYSICAL BEHAVIORAL

01:27:48.029 --> 01:27:49.998
AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS.

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.633
BUT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO LOSE

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:54.068
SIGHT OF HOW FAR WE ARE TODAY

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:56.237
FROM WIDESPREAD INFORMATION

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:57.772
SHARING JUST AMONG HEALTH CARE

01:27:57.839 --> 01:28:00.108
PROVIDERS AND PLANS WHERE WE

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:02.210
ALREADY HAVE WORKABLE H. I. E.

01:28:02.276 --> 01:28:04.979
MODELS AND SUPPORT OF POLICIES

01:28:05.046 --> 01:28:07.081
THROUGH YEP UP. BUT AFTER

01:28:07.148 --> 01:28:08.383
FIFTEEN YEARS OF EFFORTS AND

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.118
MILLIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:12.053
DOLLARS EXPANDED WE STILL HAVE

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.522
A FRAGMENTED SYSTEM. WHERE DATA

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:16.190
CANNOT MOVE EASILY BETWEEN

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:18.059
REGIONAL H. I. EASE THE

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.761
NATIONAL EXCHANGE NETWORKS AND

01:28:19.827 --> 01:28:21.462
STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:24.265
DEPARTMENTS. SO AS WE EXPAND

01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:25.299
THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE ARE

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:26.868
CONSIDERING WE NEED TO BE

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.770
DRIVEN BY BOTH URGENCY AND

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:31.406
PRAGMATISM WE DON'T HAVE A

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.707
HUNDRED OR EVEN TEN YEARS TO

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:35.443
FIGURE THIS OUT. LET'S SET A

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.545
GOAL THAT ALL HEALTH FOR HEALTH

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:40.048
PROVIDERS AND PLANS PARTICIPATE

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:42.583
IN HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE.

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.318
SHARE NEEDED DATA WITHIN THE

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:46.320
NEXT FEW YEARS OUR PHYSICIANS

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:48.189
CANNOT PROVIDE BETTER CARE TO

01:28:48.256 --> 01:28:50.058
PATIENTS WITHOUT A FULL VIEW OF

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:51.859
THE PATIENT'S RECORD. AND THEIR

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:53.895
HELP. BUT AT THE SAME TIME

01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:55.129
LET'S PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:28:55.196 --> 01:28:58.132
SUPPORT AND BASECAMP LIMITATION

01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:00.101
SO EVEN THE SMALLEST PROVIDER

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.303
CAN PARTICIPATE WITHOUT

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.971
HARDSHIP. LET'S DEFINE A

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:05.673
MINIMUM SET OF DATA THAT SHOULD

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.408
BE SHARED ACROSS SOCIAL AND

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.143
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.945
VIABLE WORKFLOWS TO SUPPORT

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:14.148
THIS EXCHANGE. AND LASTLY LET'S

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:16.551
ELIMINATE THE POLICY MURKINESS

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:18.553
THAT OFTEN SLOWS PROGRESS IN

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:20.888
THIS AREA. AND THE LAST

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:22.657
QUESTION WHAT POLICIES CAN

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.826
CALIFORNIA ENACTED LEVERAGE THE

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.094
PROGRESS MADE THROUGH THESE

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.329
NETWORKS BUT BE MORE INCLUSIVE

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:29.897
ENGINE AND ENSURE THAT

01:29:29.964 --> 01:29:32.667
CALIFORNIA'S H. I. E. SYSTEM

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:34.435
SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS AND

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.337
PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ADDRESS

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:38.906
THE WHOLE PERSON. EARLIER I

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:40.475
POINTED OUT THAT IN ORDER TO

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.743
STRENGTHEN PUBLIC HEALTH

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.377
IMPROVE CARE AND ADDRESS

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:46.114
DISPARITIES PROVIDERS IMPLANTS

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.682
NEED INSIGHTS ABOUT WHICH

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:50.184
PATIENTS ARE HIGH RISK WHICH

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.552
PATIENTS NEED PREVENTATIVE

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:53.287
CARE. WHICH PATIENTS REQUIRE

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:55.757
FOLLOW UP IN WHICH PATIENTS ARE

02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:39.645
THINK MENTIONED EARLIER GAPS IN

THE DATA SHARING ARE NOT DUE TO

02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:43.115

02:07:32.411 --> 02:07:33.779
INSIDERS HAVE BEEN REALLY KEY

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:34.513
TO GETTING HIGH LEVELS OF

IN CHINESE AS WELL AS- IN

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:43.188
ADOPTING. EIGHTY WELL BEFORE.

02:07:43.255 --> 02:07:44.690
THESE FOR GOING TO JUST BRIEF

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:45.491
ADDRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE FIRST

02:07:45.557 --> 02:07:47.693
PROPOSED GOAL OF A STATE WIDE

USE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:54.333
PURPOSES IT'S A REAL WAR THE

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:57.636
GOAL AND- IN THIS CONTEXT IT

02:07:57.703 --> 02:07:58.604
CAN HELP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH

02:07:58.670 --> 02:08:00.272
EMERGENCIES LIKE COVERT.

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:03.509
EFFECTIVELY JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:04.510
ONE OF OUR H. I. DOES THE SMALL

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:05.744

PUBLIC HEALTH TO USE THE DATA

02:08:09.915 --> 02:08:12.017
AND THEIR H. ID TO. MAP OUT THE

DIFFERENT PRIORITIZATION

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.857
FOR MOST OF THE POPULATION OF

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:20.092
HUMBOLDT COUNTY. IS A GREAT

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:21.794
EXAMPLE OF THE VALUE PROVIDED

02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:23.829
BY LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS

02:08:23.896 --> 02:08:25.764
BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND COUNTY

02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:27.733
PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M SWITCHING

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.968
GEARS TO USING HA FOR SOCIAL

02:08:30.035 --> 02:08:31.503
SERVICES AND SOCIAL CURRENTS OF

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:32.538
HEALTH WHAT IS PARTNERSHIP

02:08:32.604 --> 02:08:34.573
LEARN. ABOUT THE INFORMATION

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:36.575
NEEDS- FROM WHOLE PERSON CARE

02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:38.610
COUNTIES REALLY THERE'S A THREE

02:08:38.677 --> 02:08:40.712
LESSONS ON THAT I THINK THAT

02:08:40.779 --> 02:08:41.647
WE'VE WE'VE LEARNED THE FIRST

02:08:41.713 --> 02:08:43.549
IS THAT. BRINGING DATA TOGETHER

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:45.684
WITH INTERFACES DOES NOT MEAN

02:08:45.751 --> 02:08:47.052
THAT DATA WILL ACTUALLY BE USED

02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:49.788
OR USEFUL- ALIGNING INCENTIVES

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:50.956
OF DIFFERENT WHOLE PERSON CARE

02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:52.758
PARTNERS WAS CHEATING GETTING

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:55.327
THEM TO USE. A SHARED

02:08:55.394 --> 02:08:56.095
COMMUNICATION AND RESOURCE

02:08:56.161 --> 02:08:58.230
PLATFORM. ORGANIZATIONS THAT

02:08:58.297 --> 02:09:00.165
DEVELOPED EXTENSIVE INTERFACES

02:09:00.232 --> 02:09:01.133
BUT HAVE NOT ALIGNING

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.135
INCENTIVES FOUND LITTLE VALUE

02:09:03.202 --> 02:09:04.570
IN THESE INTERFACES.

02:09:04.636 --> 02:09:05.737
ORGANIZATIONS WITH ALIGNED

02:09:05.804 --> 02:09:06.905
INCENTIVES DEVELOPING MORE

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:08.774
ROBUST CARE PLANS AND A GOOD

02:09:08.841 --> 02:09:10.008
EXCHANGE OF COMMUNICATION

02:09:10.075 --> 02:09:11.610
BETWEEN MEMBERS OF CARE TEAMS.

02:09:11.677 --> 02:09:12.878
EVEN IF THEY HAD CLASS

02:09:12.945 --> 02:09:18.016
INTERFACES BUILT. LESS EXPECTED

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:18.917
EXCHANGE. SO PEOPLE IS THE CAR

02:09:18.984 --> 02:09:20.586
OF ALL INTERFACES AND SYSTEMS

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:22.254
MAY VASTLY EXCEED THE TIME

02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:24.089
SAVINGS OF JUST HAVING ACCESS

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:25.958
TO THE SYSTEMS EXTRACTING

02:09:26.024 --> 02:09:27.426
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM ONE

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:28.861
AND BRIEFLY ENTERING INTO

02:09:28.927 --> 02:09:30.529
ANOTHER SYSTEM. MEANS TO BE A

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:32.464
PRIORITY PRIORITIZE PACE OF

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:34.800
INTEGRATION OF DATA NOT ASSUME

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:38.203
THAT MORE INTEGRATION MORE

02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.770
AGGREGATION IS AUTOMATICALLY

02:09:38.837 --> 02:09:41.106
BETTER. AND FINALLY I MANY

02:09:41.173 --> 02:09:42.207
ORGANIZATIONS DON'T HAVE THE

02:09:42.274 --> 02:09:43.442
CAPACITY OR EXPERTISE IN

02:09:43.509 --> 02:09:45.444
ANALYTICS TO USE THAT DATA THEY

02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:48.180
ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO GENERATE

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:49.448
NEW KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM MUCH

02:09:49.515 --> 02:09:51.316
LESS ADDITIONAL DATA BROUGHT IN

02:09:51.383 --> 02:09:52.484
FROM OTHER SOURCES. BUILDING

02:09:52.551 --> 02:09:54.753
ANALYTICS CAPACITY OF THE DATA

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.989
WE ALREADY HAVE WILL GENERATE

02:09:57.055 --> 02:09:59.258
MORE VALUE. FINALLY LET ME MOVE

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:00.559
ON TO THE QUESTION OF THE

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:02.394
OPTIMAL SCOPE OF COMMUNITY

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:02.794
HEALTH INFORMATION

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:05.564
ORGANIZATIONS- WHAT IS PC LEARN

02:10:05.631 --> 02:10:07.332
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE. A ONE KEY

02:10:07.399 --> 02:10:08.834
TAKEAWAY I THINK IS THAT

02:10:08.901 --> 02:10:11.069
IMPROVING ACCESS TO USABLE DATA

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:13.205
AND INFORMATION ACROSS.

02:10:13.272 --> 02:10:14.173
DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND

02:10:14.239 --> 02:10:15.374
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.209
NOT ACHIEVED BY HAVING A SINGLE

PLATFORM. A STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK

02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:24.049
FOR EXCHANGING DATA BETWEEN

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:25.684
ORGANISATIONS AND NGOS WHAT IS

02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:27.653
NEEDED NOT A SINGLE STATEWIDE

02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:29.521
ORGANIZATION TO BE THE

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:30.122
AGGREGATOR OF DATA THROUGHOUT

COORDINATING EXCHANGE THIS

02:10:35.427 --> 02:10:37.863

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:38.630
THE FIRST TO FINANCIAL

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:41.500
STABILITY. AND A SECURE AND

02:10:41.567 --> 02:10:43.869
ROBUST TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. ARE

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:45.604
DEFINITELY FAVORED BY LARGER

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:48.507
ORGANIZATIONS ON. THIS THE NEXT

02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:50.275
TO GO A COMMUNITY RESPONSE OF

02:10:50.342 --> 02:10:51.944
GOVERNANCE THAT INCLUDES

02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:53.779
CLINICAL INPUT THAT ALLOWS.

02:10:53.845 --> 02:10:55.314
LOCAL COMPETITORS TO BUILD

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:56.315
SUFFICIENT TRUST TO WORK

02:10:56.381 --> 02:10:58.350
TOGETHER. AND THE LAST ONE THE

02:10:58.417 --> 02:10:59.284
MANAGEMENT FOCUSED ON THE

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:00.752
OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS IN

DIMINISHED ON. A DIMINISH

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:08.760
RELATIONSHIP TO SCIENCE SO AND

02:11:08.827 --> 02:11:11.230
SO THE SIZE OF THE H. I. O. IS

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:12.497
REALLY IN THE MIDDLE MIDDLE

02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:13.699
GROUND WHERE IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO

02:11:13.765 --> 02:11:14.733
OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:16.435
ROBUST TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM BUT

02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:17.269
IT'S SMALL ENOUGH TO BE

02:11:17.336 --> 02:11:19.204
COMMUNITY RESPONSIVE. AND MEET

02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:20.472

STATE ACTIONS ARE NEEDED NOW

THEY ARE CAPABLE AND THEY'RE

02:13:56.294 --> 02:14:01.600
ABLE TO. PUSH NOTICES- I THINK

02:14:01.666 --> 02:14:03.602
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY-

02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:05.137
ARE CURRENTLY DOING IT FOUR

02:14:05.203 --> 02:14:07.839
ONE. AND ALSO TO WHAT EXTENT

02:14:07.906 --> 02:14:10.142
THEY PUSH COMES FROM THE

02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:12.677
PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE- THE

02:14:12.744 --> 02:14:16.281
GAPING DOES NATIONAL- HIV- A

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:19.017
NETWORK. OF BY THE IN REALITY

02:14:19.084 --> 02:14:20.752
THEY ARE CAPABLE AND THE FACT

02:14:20.819 --> 02:14:22.854
THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE FOR

02:14:22.921 --> 02:14:23.822
EXAMPLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:25.857
STARTING MAY OF THIS YEAR WITH

02:14:25.924 --> 02:14:31.062
THAT- REQUIREMENTS. FROM OF-

02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:34.766
THE FOR THANK MEDICAID. UNDER

02:14:34.833 --> 02:14:36.835
WE CAN REGULATIONS- THE NEED TO

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:40.605
PUSH OR SOMETHING CALL AT T.

02:14:40.672 --> 02:14:41.640
ADMISSION DISCHARGE AND

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:43.608
TRANSFER IS VERY SIMPLE AND SO

02:14:43.675 --> 02:14:45.477
I THINK I THINK- WE'RE GOING TO

02:14:45.544 --> 02:14:48.280
BE A LOT MORE OF- OF. THE

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:52.217
ABILITY TO PUSH OUT- MESSAGES

02:14:52.284 --> 02:14:55.454
AND NOTICED THAT- TO ANYBODY

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:58.523
THAT NEEDS AN INCLUDING PUBLIC

02:14:58.590 --> 02:15:00.158
HEALTH. OKAY WELL THAT'S

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:01.660
INTERESTING BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE

02:15:01.726 --> 02:15:02.494
TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS WE HAVE

02:15:02.561 --> 02:15:04.362
ONE. WE HAVE ONE PERSON WHO

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:06.465
SAID NOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT IS

02:15:06.531 --> 02:15:09.801
AN INDIVIDUAL QUERY AND DOCTORS

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.303
WERE AS YOU HAVE SAID THAT THAT

02:15:11.369 --> 02:15:13.305
THEY CAN A NATIONAL NETWORKS DO

02:15:13.371 --> 02:15:15.173
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUSH ALERTS

02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:18.343
OUT SO- THAT CREATES A LITTLE

02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:19.444
CONFUSION FOR THE COMMITTEE

02:15:19.511 --> 02:15:21.346
HERE. YOU EITHER YOU EITHER

02:15:21.413 --> 02:15:22.781

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:24.983
USED OR YOU HAVE TO DO THE

02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:27.819
QUERY SO- NOT REALLY SURE OUT

02:15:27.886 --> 02:15:30.021
WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS-

02:15:30.088 --> 02:15:31.089
I LOOK AT THIS ISSUE HERE BUT

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:33.024
THAT'S A- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A

02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:34.259
DISCREPANCY OR OR OR A

02:15:34.326 --> 02:15:36.528
DIFFERENCE OF. OPINION ON THAT

02:15:36.595 --> 02:15:40.131
SO- IT YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE

02:15:40.198 --> 02:15:42.400
AREAS OF THE STATE THAT DO NOT

02:15:42.467 --> 02:15:44.936
HAVE ANY HAVE AN H. ID- THE BAY

02:15:45.003 --> 02:15:46.471
AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAS A HUGE

02:15:46.538 --> 02:15:48.073
WHITE SPACE WHICH IS. KIND OF

02:15:48.139 --> 02:15:50.041
SHOCKING TO ME BECAUSE OF. THE

02:15:50.108 --> 02:15:50.976
FACT THAT IT IS A LARGE

02:15:51.042 --> 02:15:52.143
METROPOLITAN AREA YOUNG WITH

AREAS THAT ARE COVERED UP BY A

02:16:43.428 --> 02:16:45.030
CURRENT REGIONAL HIV CAN

02:16:45.096 --> 02:16:47.666
ACTUALLY EASILY BE COVERED. BY

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:49.768
THAT STATEWIDE APPROACH ONCE

02:18:07.612 --> 02:18:10.448
HERE- BUT IT'S UNEVEN AMONG THE

02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:12.684
PROVIDERS BECAUSE IT'S LARGER

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:14.185
SYSTEMS THAT ARE USING THE

02:18:14.252 --> 02:18:15.387
NATIONAL NETWORKS EXCHANGE WITH

02:18:15.453 --> 02:18:17.188
EACH OTHER. MAKES IT DIFFICULT

02:18:17.255 --> 02:18:18.156
FOR SMALL PROVIDERS TO

02:18:18.223 --> 02:18:20.692
PARTICIPATE- SO THAT'S WHAT WE

02:18:20.759 --> 02:18:22.060
YOU KNOW AS WE TRY TO DEFINE

02:18:22.127 --> 02:18:23.295
THE PROBLEM TRYING TO SOLVE

02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:26.665
FOR. THAT POLICYMAKERS ARE IS

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:27.265
ONE OF THE PROBLEM TRYING TO

02:18:27.332 --> 02:18:29.334
SOLVE FOR. IS AREN'T

02:18:29.401 --> 02:18:30.935
NECESSARILY DATA EXCHANGE WHITE

02:18:31.002 --> 02:18:32.137
SPACES THAT THAT THAT'S

02:18:32.203 --> 02:18:34.005
PROVIDERS WHO CAN'T PARTICIPATE

02:18:34.072 --> 02:18:38.376
IN THE FORMER DATA EXCHANGE.

02:18:38.443 --> 02:18:38.910
THAT'S HAPPENING IN THOSE

02:18:38.977 --> 02:18:39.544
REGIONS. WITH YOU JUST KIND OF

02:18:39.611 --> 02:18:40.845
MADE IN OUR IN FAVOR OF

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:42.747
SOMETHING MORE COHESIVE AND-

02:18:42.814 --> 02:18:45.784
THERE. AT IT. IF THEY CAN'T

02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:47.052
PARTICIPATE THEN WE SHOULD BE

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:48.687
GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:18:48.753 --> 02:18:49.187
FIND SOMETHING THEY CAN

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:50.989
PARTICIPATE IN. ISN'T THAT

02:18:51.056 --> 02:18:55.326
CORRECT. YEAH WELL ANYONE THAT

02:18:55.393 --> 02:18:56.628
COULD COME IN SEVERAL FORMS I

02:18:56.695 --> 02:18:58.496
MEAN THERE COULD BE REGIONALLY

02:18:58.563 --> 02:19:00.231
GILES I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

02:19:00.298 --> 02:19:02.567
WITH DOCTOR MORE- THE CLOSER WE

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:04.502
KEEP A CHILD WAS TO THE GROUND.

02:19:04.569 --> 02:19:06.204
EASIER IT IS TO BUILD TRUST AND

02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:11.076
LOAN- YOU KNOW OR- WE NEED TO

02:19:11.142 --> 02:19:12.744
SUPPORT THE PROVIDERS. IN

02:19:12.811 --> 02:19:13.845
GETTING ONTO MORE ROBUST

02:19:13.912 --> 02:19:15.146
SYSTEMS ALLOW THEM TO

02:19:15.213 --> 02:19:18.249
PARTICIPATE IN OTHER FORMS OF

02:19:18.316 --> 02:19:19.684
DATA EXCHANGE. OKAY STILL ALL

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:21.986
THOSE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX IS.

02:19:22.053 --> 02:19:23.855
SENATE JUST OF BRIEF BRIEF WORD

02:19:23.922 --> 02:19:24.823
ON THAT YOU KNOW THERE WERE

02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:26.624
SOME ATTEMPTS TO CREATE HEALTH

02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:27.859
INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS IN

02:19:27.926 --> 02:19:29.694
THE BAY AREA IN THE PAST AND

02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:31.196
THEY COULDN'T GET PAST THE

02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:33.398
TRUST ISSUES AND THE THING IS

02:19:33.465 --> 02:19:34.199
NOT AN EXTERNAL MANDATE ONE

02:19:34.265 --> 02:19:36.167
OVERCOME THE TRUST CHALLENGES

02:19:36.234 --> 02:19:37.736
IN THE END YOU DO HAVE TO COME

02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:39.304
UP WITH A MECHANISM TO GET

02:19:39.370 --> 02:19:42.307
COMPETITORS TO. FEEL SAFE-

02:19:42.373 --> 02:19:43.608
CONTRIBUTING DATA THAT THEY YOU

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:45.076
CAN SEE WITH EACH OTHER AND

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:47.278
UNDERSTAND THEIR ON THAT THEIR

02:19:47.345 --> 02:19:49.814
MUTUAL MUTUAL CHARACTER AND

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:51.549
QUALITY CARE FOR THEIR YOUR

02:19:51.616 --> 02:19:55.086
PATIENCE IS AT STAKE SO. I'M

02:19:55.153 --> 02:19:57.822
NOT SURE. ELABORATE ON TRUST

02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:59.891
FOR ME BECAUSE- AT THE END OF

02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:01.860
THE DAY THIS IS THE PATIENTS

02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:04.863
INFORMATION. THE MEDICAL RECORD

02:20:04.929 --> 02:20:07.866
IS THE PATIENT'S RECORD. THE

02:20:07.932 --> 02:20:10.101
PROVIDER IS THE CUSTODIAN OF

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:11.269
THE RECORDS IT'S NOT THE

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:13.938
PROPERTY OF THE PLAN OR THE

02:20:14.005 --> 02:20:16.608

CUSTODIAN OF THAT SO ARE YOU

02:20:19.911 --> 02:20:20.445
SAYING THAT PART OF THE ISSUE

02:20:20.512 --> 02:20:23.114
IS THAT. ENTITIES DON'T WANT TO

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:23.648
TRUST EACH OTHER WITH THE

02:20:23.715 --> 02:20:25.850
INFORMATION. BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:27.252
YOUR IN FOR IT'S NOT YOUR

02:20:27.318 --> 02:20:29.721
DECISION TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

02:20:29.788 --> 02:20:30.822
IT'S THE PICK IT SHOULD BE THE

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:32.791
PATIENT'S DECISION AND THAT'S

02:20:32.857 --> 02:20:34.526
KIND OF WHAT THE CONSENT IS SO.

02:20:34.592 --> 02:20:36.895
HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

02:20:36.961 --> 02:20:38.797
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I'M- I

02:20:38.863 --> 02:20:40.098
DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND RIGHT

02:20:40.165 --> 02:20:41.366
WELL LET ME. THE WEIGHT HA

02:20:41.432 --> 02:20:42.867
STALK THEY DON'T WORK BY ASKING

02:20:42.934 --> 02:20:44.936
EACH INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DO YOU

02:20:45.003 --> 02:20:47.305
WANT TO CONTRIBUTE. TO THIS H.

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:48.540
ID THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE WORK.

02:20:48.606 --> 02:20:49.474
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

02:20:49.541 --> 02:20:51.209
LOOKING AT DOING NOW THAT'S

02:20:51.276 --> 02:20:51.776
SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING TO

02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:54.412
CONSIDER SO. YES SO IF THAT IS

02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:55.446
CONSIDERED IT WILL ACTUALLY

02:20:55.513 --> 02:20:56.581
SORT OF IF YOU THINK ABOUT IF

02:20:56.648 --> 02:20:59.083
YOU WERE TO REQUIRE. AN OPT IN

02:20:59.150 --> 02:21:00.852
FOR ANY H. I EAT IT WITH IT

02:21:00.919 --> 02:21:01.953
WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE THAT

02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:02.954
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE OF

02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:04.255
TRYING TO GET THAT KIND OF-

02:21:04.322 --> 02:21:06.257
COMPREHENSIVE DATA. SO BECAUSE

02:21:06.324 --> 02:21:07.358
YOU'RE GETTING COMPREHENSIVE

02:21:07.425 --> 02:21:09.027
DATA WITHOUT PATIENT CONSENT

02:21:09.093 --> 02:21:11.462
YOU HAVE TO USE- THAT'S WHERE

02:21:11.529 --> 02:21:12.931
THE TRUST COMES IN THERE HAS TO

02:21:12.997 --> 02:21:14.098
BE IT HAS TO FIT WITHIN THE

02:21:14.165 --> 02:21:16.801
FRAMEWORK OF. OF OF HIPPA. AND

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:18.603
ALSO IN THE FRAMEWORK OF

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:21.472
PRIVACY AND SECURITY- AT THE

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:22.907
END THAT DOES THAT'S WHERE THAT

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:25.043
THE CHALLENGES. ARISE THERE'S

02:21:25.109 --> 02:21:26.477
ALSO THERE ARE SOME FRANKLY

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:28.012
THERE ARE SOME ORGANIZATIONS

02:21:28.079 --> 02:21:29.347
WORK WE'RE NOT FOR PROFIT WE

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:30.381
DON'T. YOU KNOW HAVE TO HAVE

02:21:30.448 --> 02:21:31.616
THIS CONCERN BUT- BUT THERE

02:21:31.683 --> 02:21:33.718
ARE- YOU KNOW ORGANIZATIONS WHO

02:21:33.785 --> 02:21:35.954
ARE WHO ARE. COMPETITORS IN THE

02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:37.755
SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA WE'RE

02:21:37.822 --> 02:21:38.990
WORRIED THAT THE DATA MIGHT BE

02:21:39.057 --> 02:21:43.061
MIND TO BE USED FOR- AFRICAN-

02:21:43.127 --> 02:21:44.362
COMPETITIVE PURPOSES SO THAT

02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:49.534
THAT'S. A CONCERN THAT'S THAT'S

02:21:49.601 --> 02:21:50.335
OUT THERE. SO IT A BUSINESS.

02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:52.470
ISSUE NOT AT AT THE TRUST ISSUE

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:53.605
THE BUSINESS LAW. NOT IN THE

02:21:53.671 --> 02:21:54.973
INTEREST OF THE PATIENT'S

02:21:55.039 --> 02:21:58.810
OVERALL HEALTH CONDITION. YEP I

02:21:58.877 --> 02:22:00.278
WOULD SAY THAT IT STEP THAT

02:22:00.345 --> 02:22:02.647
SOME OF THE MAJOR CERTAINLY

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:04.148
WHEN CINICIANS GET TOGETHER

02:22:04.215 --> 02:22:05.416
THEY ALL GENERALLY AGREE THAT

02:22:05.483 --> 02:22:06.618
WE NEED TO EXCHANGE DATA TO

02:22:06.684 --> 02:22:08.553
IMPROVE HEALTH. ON THE HEALTH

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:10.355
STATUS OF OUR MAP OF OUR OF OUR

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:12.190
PATIENTS WE SERVE. THAT'S

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:13.258
THAT'S NOT IT THAT'S KNOWS NO

02:22:13.324 --> 02:22:14.559
DISAGREEMENT THERE BUT THE

02:22:14.626 --> 02:22:16.327
QUESTION IS WILL ALL PLAYERS

02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:19.330
WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA

02:22:19.397 --> 02:22:19.964
ONLY BE USING THE DATA FOR THAT

02:22:20.031 --> 02:22:24.469
PURPOSE. FOR WITHHOLDING THAT

02:22:24.535 --> 02:22:26.504
INFORMATION SO THAT IT CAN'T BE

02:22:26.571 --> 02:22:29.073
SHARED. ALL RIGHT I GUESS SO

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:31.876
OKAY. I WILL TAKES IT TAKES

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:33.044
ACTIVE WORK TO CREATE AN

02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:34.178
INTERFACE THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT

02:22:34.245 --> 02:22:36.147
ACTIVE WORK TO YOU KNOW IT IT

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:38.182
TAKES DOLLARS IT TAKES-

02:22:38.249 --> 02:22:39.817
DISCRETIONARY ENERGY TO BUILD

02:22:39.884 --> 02:22:42.153
EACH EACH OF THOSE INTERFACES

02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:43.688
SO. IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT

02:22:43.755 --> 02:22:46.457
REALLY WORTH HOLDING AS MUCH AS

02:22:46.524 --> 02:22:47.258
DE PRIORITIZING YOU MIGHT SAY.

02:22:47.325 --> 02:22:50.495
OKAY OKAY THANK YOU- ACTUALLY

02:22:50.561 --> 02:22:54.265
QUESTION FOR DOLORES- IF YOU-

02:22:54.332 --> 02:22:55.333
IF YOU'RE A NEW YOU'RE STILL

02:22:55.400 --> 02:23:01.239
OUT THERE SO- YOU TALKED ABOUT-

AND IN THE RIVERSIDE AREA THE

02:23:17.155 --> 02:23:20.825
WORST. AN EMPIRE- THE MAJORITY

02:23:20.892 --> 02:23:23.528
OF HOSPITALS ARE PARTICIPATING

02:23:23.594 --> 02:23:25.330
THERE ARE A COUPLE THAT ARE

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:29.000
NOT- BUT AND THEN THE MAJORITY

02:23:29.067 --> 02:23:31.069
OF THE LARGE GROUPS ARE

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:34.105
PARTICIPATING AND NOW WE ARE

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:37.442
DOWN TO TRYING TO BRING ON THE

02:23:37.508 --> 02:23:40.244
SOLO SMALL GROUP PRACTICE-

02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:42.647
PHYSICIANS WHICH BRINGS ITS OWN

02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:45.450
CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE COSTS

02:23:45.516 --> 02:23:48.453
THAT THE A EHR VENDORS. MAY

02:23:48.519 --> 02:23:51.589
CHARGE THAT THE PRACTICE TO DO

02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:54.092
THE WORK ON THEIR END ALTHOUGH

E. S. AT NO COST FOR THE

02:24:00.164 --> 02:24:03.334
AMATORY PROVIDERS BUT IT TAKES

02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:05.069
A LOT DID YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE

02:24:05.136 --> 02:24:06.804
INTERFACES THE INTERFACES ARE

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:10.842
EXPENSIVE- I HAVE ONE-

02:24:10.908 --> 02:24:13.344
PEDIATRIC PRACTICE THAT HAS

CHALLENGES THAT THE SMALL

PRACTICES HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:24:56.421 --> 02:24:59.590
THE I. T. EXPERTISE THEY DON'T

02:24:59.657 --> 02:25:01.726
HAVE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

02:25:01.793 --> 02:25:03.594
THAT WAS JUST FOR ONE REPORT

THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES FOR

02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:12.036
THE SOLO SMALL GROUP PRACTICE

02:25:12.103 --> 02:25:14.872
TO PARTICIPATE- AND A LOT OF

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:16.441
THAT. HAS TO DO WITH THE DATA

02:25:16.507 --> 02:25:18.443
BLOCKING THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE

02:25:18.509 --> 02:25:21.546
RESOLVED BUT- AMONGST LONG

02:25:21.612 --> 02:25:23.548
ANSWER AND I APOLOGIZE SO I

02:25:23.614 --> 02:25:25.383
WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THEBIG

02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:28.953
PRACTICES ARE PARTICIPATING A

02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:30.621
98% OF THE HOSPITALS ARE

02:27:34.845 --> 02:27:38.716
THING THAT ALL THOSE EFFORTS-

HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY

02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:41.018
WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. AND YOU KNOW

02:27:41.085 --> 02:27:42.687

WHAT ARE THE ABSOLUTELY

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:47.725
ESSENTIAL PIECES THAT WE THINK

02:27:47.792 --> 02:27:51.429
NEED TO HAPPEN- NO MATTER HOW

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:53.331
WE NEED FOR NINETEEN EXCHANGE

OTHER STATES THE OTHERS TALKING

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:59.270
STATEWIDE HIV. THE CENTRAL

02:27:59.337 --> 02:28:00.571
COMPONENT THAT I LAID OUT

02:28:00.638 --> 02:28:01.939
EARLIER IN MY TALK NEED TO

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:04.141
HAPPEN NO MATTER WHICH OF THOSE

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:05.676
RIGHTS WILL TAKE. AND THAT'S

02:28:05.743 --> 02:28:07.211
REALLY WHERE CNN'S NOT RIGHT

02:28:07.278 --> 02:28:08.946
NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE

02:28:09.013 --> 02:28:10.314
REALLY FOUNDATIONAL THINGS THAT

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:11.782
AS YOU YOU KNOW AS AS A

02:28:11.849 --> 02:28:14.218
CONFERENCE HERE YOU DON'T A LOT

02:28:14.285 --> 02:28:14.785
OF US OF SAYING ROUGHLY THE

02:28:14.852 --> 02:28:17.321
SAME THINGS. PUBLIC HEALTH DATA

02:28:17.388 --> 02:28:21.092
FEDERAL FUNDING. SUPPORT FOR

02:28:21.158 --> 02:28:22.293
SMALL PRACTICES. AND SO I DON'T

02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:24.195
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE'VE-

02:28:24.262 --> 02:28:26.964
CHANGED POSITION AS MUCH AS WE-

02:28:27.031 --> 02:28:28.165
TOOK A STEP BACK AND SAID ONE

02:28:28.232 --> 02:28:29.934
OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS IN

02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:30.701
ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL BUILDING

02:28:30.768 --> 02:28:32.670
BLOCKS BEACH IS TO PUT IN

02:28:32.737 --> 02:28:34.772
PLACE. TO REALLY LOOK AT

02:28:34.839 --> 02:28:37.308
EXCHANGE FORMER- I FOUND IT

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:38.743
INTERESTING. WHEN YOU WERE

02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:42.947
TALKING YOU TALKED ABOUT- DATE

02:28:43.014 --> 02:28:44.148
WITH THAT WITH THE QUESTION

02:28:44.215 --> 02:28:45.616
THAT WAS COVERT RELATED YOU

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:47.918
TALKED ABOUT WITH THAT WE GREAT

02:28:47.985 --> 02:28:48.853
FOR PRACTICES TO HAVE THE

02:28:48.919 --> 02:28:51.889
ABILITY TO ACCESS CAL READY-

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:55.559
AND- AT THE ACCESSIBLE AT A

02:28:55.626 --> 02:28:57.194
POINT AT A POINT IN THE

02:28:57.261 --> 02:29:00.197
PRACTICE. BUT THAT'S KIND OF A

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.766
ONE WAY FLOW OF INFORMATION FOR

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:06.737
A DOCTOR TO ACCESS ACCESS. SO

02:29:06.804 --> 02:29:09.473
ARE YOU AGAINST THE- THE FLOW

02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:11.409
OF INFORMATION THE OTHER WAY

02:29:11.475 --> 02:29:12.943
BECAUSE BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW

02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:14.779
IT'S GREAT IF YOU WANT TO QUERY

02:29:14.845 --> 02:29:16.280
IF THE DOCTOR WANTS TO UERY

02:29:16.347 --> 02:29:17.548
AND FIND OUT IF THIS PATIENT

02:29:17.615 --> 02:29:19.617
THERE BUT WOULDN'T IT BE NICE

02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:21.852
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE

02:29:21.919 --> 02:29:24.722
INFORMATION FLOWING YOU KNOW TO

02:29:24.789 --> 02:29:25.222
YOU. THROUGH AN ALERT OR

02:29:25.289 --> 02:29:29.060
SOMETHING. OH OH OH ABSOLUTELY.

02:29:29.126 --> 02:29:30.761
I MEAN THE PROBLEM WITH THE

02:29:30.828 --> 02:29:32.863
PROBLEM WITH THE CDPH DATA

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:35.566
TODAY. IS THAT IT ONLY FLOWS

02:29:35.633 --> 02:29:37.802
ONE DIRECTION WE HAVE PROVIDERS

02:29:37.868 --> 02:29:38.869
WHO ARE PUTTING PEOPLE INTO THE

02:29:38.936 --> 02:29:40.871
SYSTEM AND YOU CAN'T GET

02:29:40.938 --> 02:29:43.641
ANYTHING BACK OUT- YOU KNOW

02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:45.209
CDPH HAS IT AND YOU KNOW I

02:29:45.276 --> 02:29:46.677
MIGHT SORT OF DOWNTIME WHICH

02:29:46.744 --> 02:29:49.480
SHE COMMENT ON THIS. CD PH HAS

02:29:49.547 --> 02:29:50.715
NHL YOU CAME WHEN WHAT WITH

02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:52.450
THIS GOVERNMENTS AND DEMOCRATS

02:29:52.516 --> 02:29:54.352
THAT. J. GATEWAY ONLY SWINGS

02:29:54.418 --> 02:29:57.088
ONE WAY. AND SO IT'S GREAT TO

02:29:57.154 --> 02:29:58.756
DEMAND BUT IT DOESN'T GET DATA

02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:00.624
BACK TO THE POINT CARE NOW I

02:30:00.691 --> 02:30:03.894
THINK YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS.

02:30:03.961 --> 02:30:05.062
HOW DO WE GET THAT DATA IN THE

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:08.833
POINT OF CARE. AND AGAIN.

02:30:08.899 --> 02:30:10.601
MULTIPLE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX.

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:12.403
THE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BIGGER

02:30:12.470 --> 02:30:14.805
SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTED DIRECTLY

02:30:14.872 --> 02:30:17.675
AT ICE- KEPT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:30:17.742 --> 02:30:19.443
DATA. OTHER SMALLER PRACTICES

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:20.378
ARE GOING TO NEED REGIONAL

02:30:20.444 --> 02:30:21.312
HEALTH INFORMATION

02:30:21.379 --> 02:30:22.747
ORGANIZATIONS AGGREGATE AND

02:30:22.813 --> 02:30:24.782
STUFF AS AN INTERMEDIARY. ON

02:30:24.849 --> 02:30:26.484
THAT DATA IS ALL DIFFERENT WAYS

02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:28.953
WE CAN DO THIS BUT WE NEED TO

02:30:29.019 --> 02:30:32.923
REALLY ENHANCE THAT ABILITY FOR

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:34.358
DAVID A FLAWED SYSTEM. AND IT'S

02:30:34.425 --> 02:30:35.760
I'VE FIND IT JUST A GENERAL

02:30:35.826 --> 02:30:38.362
COMMENT- SEVERAL PEOPLE OF FOLK

02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:40.765
HAVE HAVE TALKED ABOUT SMALL

02:30:40.831 --> 02:30:43.234
PRACTICES AND- A SENSE OF.

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:44.568
HAVING BEEN SOMEONE WHO WAS

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:46.537
ACTUALLY IN A SMALL PRACTICE.

02:30:46.604 --> 02:30:49.407
AS A DENTIST- YEAH I I'VE I SAW

02:30:49.473 --> 02:30:50.775
THOSE CHALLENGES AS WELL AND IT

02:30:50.841 --> 02:30:52.443
WAS IT WAS A CHALLENGE FOR ME

02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:54.779
AS A PROVIDER TO ADOPT. A

02:30:54.845 --> 02:30:56.213
CERTAIN KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES

02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:59.116
BECAUSE OF MY LOCATION OR AND

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:00.684
THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THOSE

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:03.254
TECHNOLOGIES AND SO ON SO. SO I

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:05.189
RECOGNIZE THAT IN WHATEVER WE

02:31:05.256 --> 02:31:07.425
WORK ON YOU CAN BET THAT I'M

02:31:07.491 --> 02:31:08.926
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT MAKING

02:31:08.993 --> 02:31:11.195
SURE THAT SMALL PROVIDERS- ARE

02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:12.930
ABLE TO DO THIS. BUT I DON'T

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:14.799
WANT TO SEE SMALL PROVIDE THE

02:31:14.865 --> 02:31:17.868
SMALL THE SMALL PROVIDER ISSUE.

02:31:17.935 --> 02:31:20.070
AS BEING AS AN IMPEDIMENT FOR

02:31:20.137 --> 02:31:21.972
US TO DO SOMETHING I THINK

02:31:22.039 --> 02:31:23.340
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS FOR THAT

02:31:23.407 --> 02:31:26.010
AND I THINK THAT- I THINK EVERY

02:31:26.076 --> 02:31:27.878
EVERY PROVIDER NEEDS TO BE ABLE

02:31:27.945 --> 02:31:29.480
TO BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE A

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:30.915
HAPPY ABLE TO ACCESS. THE SAME

02:31:30.981 --> 02:31:32.316
INFORMATION BECAUSE AT THE END

02:31:32.383 --> 02:31:34.084
OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT

02:31:34.151 --> 02:31:36.454
QUALITY OF CARE APPROPRIATE

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:39.356
CARE NON DUPLICATIVE CARE CARE

02:31:39.423 --> 02:31:41.459
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ERRORS-

02:31:41.525 --> 02:31:42.626
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE

02:31:42.693 --> 02:31:44.495
INFORMATION- AND I THINK THAT

02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:46.163
THAT PUTTING ALL THAT TOGETHER.

02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:47.965
IS REALLY IN THE BEST INTEREST

02:31:48.032 --> 02:31:50.801
OF THE PATIENT AND SO- I WANT

02:31:50.868 --> 02:31:51.869
TO KEEP COMING BACK TO THE

02:31:51.936 --> 02:31:53.471
PATIENT BECAUSE IT IS REALLY

02:31:53.537 --> 02:31:55.473
ALL ABOUT THE PATIENT. AND THE

02:31:55.539 --> 02:31:59.310
DATA IS THEIR DATA AND ALL THE

02:31:59.376 --> 02:32:00.377
ALL THE SYSTEMS AND ALL THESE

02:32:00.444 --> 02:32:01.612
OTHER PEOPLE. ARE THE

02:32:01.679 --> 02:32:03.347
CUSTODIANS SO NEVER FORGET THAT

02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:06.150
PART OF IT- AND I THINK THAT

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:07.685
THAT'S A REALLY A REALLY

02:32:07.751 --> 02:32:08.686
IMPORTANT THINGAND I THINK

02:32:08.752 --> 02:32:10.788
IT'S- YOU KNOW IT I THINK JUST

02:32:10.855 --> 02:32:14.558
A GENERAL COMMENT HERE ABOUT

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:15.359
THAT IS IT. IT IS- IT IS

02:32:15.426 --> 02:32:20.064
DISCONCERTING. TO NOTE THAT I.

02:32:20.130 --> 02:32:21.632
COULD GO TO ANOTHER PART OF THE

02:32:21.699 --> 02:32:24.869
STATE THE STATE. AND HAVE TO

02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:26.537
SEE A MEDICAL PROVIDER THAT IS

02:32:26.604 --> 02:32:28.439
OUTSIDE OF MY CURRENT MEDICAL

02:32:28.506 --> 02:32:31.008
SYSTEM THAT HAS A PRETTY GOOD

02:32:31.075 --> 02:32:33.444
HAS A REALLY GOOD ROBUST.

02:32:33.511 --> 02:32:34.245
RECORD SYSTEM WITH IN THAT

02:32:34.311 --> 02:32:36.981
SYSTEM. AND THAT PROVIDER MAY

02:32:37.047 --> 02:32:38.949
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ACCESSING

02:32:39.016 --> 02:32:41.352
THAT INFORMATION ESPECIALLY IF

02:32:41.418 --> 02:32:42.920
I WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND THEY

02:32:42.987 --> 02:32:45.189
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM-

02:32:45.256 --> 02:32:45.823
BUT THEY WOULD THEY WOULD MIGHT

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:48.259
KNOW MY NAME AND MY AND BE ABLE

02:32:48.325 --> 02:32:49.059
TO ACCESS INFORMATION THAT WAY

02:32:49.126 --> 02:32:53.631
BUT- BUT THE LACK OF ABILITY

02:32:53.697 --> 02:32:54.999
FOR INFORMATION TO FLOW IN A

02:32:55.065 --> 02:32:58.769
WAY. THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO- TO

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:00.404
GET THE APPROPRIATE CARE AT THE

02:33:00.471 --> 02:33:02.973
APPROPRIATE TIME IS WHAT IS

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:05.476
DRIVING- DRIVING THIS THIS

02:33:05.543 --> 02:33:06.844
MIGHT MY DESIRE TO DO

02:33:06.911 --> 02:33:08.779
SOMETHING- SOMETHING MORE ABOUT

02:33:08.846 --> 02:33:11.782
THAT- AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE MOVE

02:33:11.849 --> 02:33:13.918
AROUND IN THE STATE AND- AND

02:33:13.984 --> 02:33:17.054
THEY- AND IN JUST BECAUSE THEY

02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:19.423
DO DOESN'T MEAN. THEY SHOULD.

02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:22.026
HAVE TO NOT GET THE OPTIMAL

TIMELY WAY THAT'S COMPLETE

02:33:32.236 --> 02:33:34.305
ENOUGH TO PAINT A PICTURE TO

02:33:34.371 --> 02:33:35.806

FOR A C. PAN. I THINK IT'S A

02:33:59.530 --> 02:34:02.466

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:23.053
SHOULD WE BE THINKING OF

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:24.288

HEARD FROM THE RIVERSIDE

02:36:58.642 --> 02:36:59.877
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THAT YOUR

02:36:59.943 --> 02:37:01.879
HOSPITAL DOESN'T PARTICIPATE IN

02:37:01.945 --> 02:37:07.151
THEIR SYSTEM THERE- SO JUST IN

02:37:07.217 --> 02:37:10.053
GENERAL HOWWOULD KAISER NO IF

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:12.923

WELL I WANTED TO MAKE A POINT

02:37:22.733 --> 02:37:25.402
ABOUT THAT- COMMENT BECAUSE I

02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:30.507
THINK- WHAT DID THE- EXCHANGES

02:37:30.574 --> 02:37:33.110
HIGHLIGHTING IS THE ABILITY FOR

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:35.179
AN ORGANIZATION TO BE A PART OF

02:37:35.245 --> 02:37:38.015
FOR EXAMPLE IN NATIONAL-

02:37:38.081 --> 02:37:40.117
NETWORK A NATIONAL HRD NETWORK

02:37:40.184 --> 02:37:42.119
LIKE EHEALTH EXCHANGE YOUR AIR

02:37:42.186 --> 02:37:45.289
QUALITY OR- COMMA WELL OR ON

02:37:45.355 --> 02:37:48.091
ONES. AND STILL BE ABLE TO

02:37:48.158 --> 02:37:51.128
CONNECT THROUGH THAT WITH THE-

02:37:51.195 --> 02:37:56.200
LOCAL REGIONAL HIV THAT IS.

02:37:56.266 --> 02:37:56.834
ALSO CONNECTED TO THAT NATIONAL

02:37:56.900 --> 02:38:00.337
NETWORK- SO THAT IS A WAY THAT

02:38:00.404 --> 02:38:05.742
WE- SEE AT THE- VIABLE WAY IN

02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:08.712
THE FACT THAT THE WAY WE-

02:38:08.779 --> 02:38:09.213
CONNECT TO MANY OF OUR

02:38:09.279 --> 02:38:11.548
PROVIDERS TO- THE DIFFERENT

02:38:11.615 --> 02:38:13.250
NATIONAL NETWORKS THAT EXIST

02:38:13.317 --> 02:38:15.319
AND- WITH SOME OF THE REGIONAL

02:38:15.385 --> 02:38:18.655
NETWORK AS WELL SO- SO I THINK

02:38:18.722 --> 02:38:21.792
I THINK. MY POINT WHAT PRETTY

02:38:21.859 --> 02:38:24.494
TO HIGHLIGHT HOW. STILL THERE

02:38:24.561 --> 02:38:26.663
IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:38:26.730 --> 02:38:28.899
INTERCONNECT THE CHINESE I'M

02:38:28.966 --> 02:38:30.734
THRILLED THAT INTERCONNECTION

02:38:30.801 --> 02:38:32.569
AVE TAKE PARTICIPANTS TOOK TO

02:38:32.636 --> 02:38:36.373
EACH OTHER AND SO THAT. EACH OF

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:37.274
THE PARTICIPANT DOESN'T HAVE TO

02:38:37.341 --> 02:38:39.576
REALLY PARTICIPATE IN EVERY ONE

02:38:39.643 --> 02:38:42.346
OF THE HIV THAT COULD NOT

02:38:42.412 --> 02:38:48.051
HAPPEN IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION.

02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:50.387
SO RIVERSIDE COULD GET YOUR

02:38:50.454 --> 02:38:53.557
INFORMATION. BUT THEY HAVE TO

02:38:53.624 --> 02:38:54.691
GO THROUGH A THIRD PARTY THIRD

02:38:54.758 --> 02:38:57.928
PARTY ESSENTIALLY AN AND THEY

02:38:57.995 --> 02:39:00.797
COULD BRING THEIR BORDERS SO

02:39:00.864 --> 02:39:02.766
YEAH I MEAN IT JUST LIKE- ANY

02:39:02.833 --> 02:39:05.669
PROVIDER INSIDE DATA IN THEM

02:39:05.736 --> 02:39:07.704
THE RIVER SIDE H. ID LIKE TO GO

02:39:07.771 --> 02:39:13.110
THROUGH THEY RIVERSIDE HIV AS A

02:39:13.176 --> 02:39:13.977
THIRD PARTY INTERFACE. OR

02:39:14.044 --> 02:39:16.713
NETWORK. HI THERE CONNECT TO A

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:19.283
NATIONAL NETWORK. I'M THROUGH

02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:20.617
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE

02:39:20.684 --> 02:39:23.287
TWO HIV IS THAT THE RIVERSIDE

02:39:23.353 --> 02:39:26.290
PROVIDER CAN TALK TO THE

02:39:26.356 --> 02:39:28.425
CHRYSLER PROVIDER OR VICE VERSA.

02:39:28.492 --> 02:39:29.493
SO WHY NOT JUST WHEN I JUST

02:39:29.559 --> 02:39:31.528
PARTICIPATE WITH WITH RIVERSIDE

02:39:31.595 --> 02:39:33.263
WHITE WHITE WHITE WHY DON'T WHY

02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:39.036
DON'T YOU PARTICIPATE. WELL I

02:39:39.102 --> 02:39:40.537
THINK WE DON'T CONNECT TO

02:39:40.604 --> 02:39:44.775
RIVERSIDE- WE ALSO CONNECT TO

02:39:44.841 --> 02:39:46.677
THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND IF THE

02:39:46.743 --> 02:39:50.914
QUESTION BECOMES REALLY WHICH-

02:39:50.981 --> 02:39:53.083
VEHICLE DO YOU USE TO.

02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:56.153
AUTOMATICALLY REACH THE OTHER

02:39:56.219 --> 02:39:57.154
PROVIDER THAT YOU NEED TO REACH

02:39:57.220 --> 02:40:01.024
TO- WHETHER YOU USE IT TO DO DO

02:40:01.091 --> 02:40:04.094
IT THROUGH DAVIS- HIV TO HIV

02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:06.496
CONNECTIONS OVER THEY DO JOIN A

02:40:06.563 --> 02:40:09.633
PARTICULAR HIV. AND EXCHANGE

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:11.501
DATA WITH THEM- AND SO THOSE

02:40:11.568 --> 02:40:15.005
ARE YOU KNOW. TO BUY A WEIGHT

02:40:15.072 --> 02:40:16.740
OF- EXCHANGING THE INFORMATION

02:40:16.807 --> 02:40:18.875
AT THE END AS YOU POINTED OUT

02:40:18.942 --> 02:40:20.444
DR WITH IMPORTANT THING IS TO

02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:23.947
BE ABLE TO DO IT ALL. BASICALLY

02:40:24.014 --> 02:40:25.015
DELIVER THE RIGHT CARE TO THE

02:40:25.082 --> 02:40:27.451
RIGHT PERSON AND CHIEVING THAT

02:40:27.517 --> 02:40:29.619
INTERCONNECTION AND ACHIEVING

02:40:29.686 --> 02:40:32.456
THAT EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION-

02:40:32.522 --> 02:40:34.958
BY CONNECTING YOU KNOW THE

02:40:35.025 --> 02:40:37.227
DIFFERENT HIV- IT'LL COMMITTEE

02:40:37.294 --> 02:40:42.566
WHAT. WOULD WHAT. WOULD SERVE

02:40:42.632 --> 02:40:43.533
DOUBLE SPACING. IT FEELS A LOT

02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:45.068
CONTRA- IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY

02:40:45.135 --> 02:40:48.972
SEAMLESS. SO LIKE I GUESS I

02:40:49.039 --> 02:40:52.075
GUESS. THAT'S IT JUST DOESN'T

02:40:52.142 --> 02:40:53.610
IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY SEAMLESS

02:40:53.677 --> 02:40:56.747
SO- SO AND IT JUST. KIND OF YOU

02:40:56.813 --> 02:41:00.050
KNOW THERE. AND IT DIDN'T JUST

02:41:00.117 --> 02:41:00.517
TO FOLLOW UP THE OTHER

02:41:00.584 --> 02:41:03.754
INTERESTING. ASPECT OF THE

02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:06.823
TECHNOLOGY NOWADAYS IS THAT-

02:41:06.890 --> 02:41:08.291
THROUGH NEWER TECHNOLOGY AND TO

TRYING TO ACTIVATE A FROM

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:17.801
ANOTHER PROVIDER I THINK WITH

02:41:17.868 --> 02:41:22.606

PROVIDE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

02:41:52.936 --> 02:41:58.275
TO. ACTON DATA IN REAL TIME

02:41:58.341 --> 02:41:58.875
THROUGH THE STATE YEAH I FROM

02:41:58.942 --> 02:42:00.977
OTHER PROVIDERS. BECAUSE

02:42:01.044 --> 02:42:02.079
PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO BE

02:42:02.145 --> 02:42:04.481
REQUIRED TO MAKE THAT DATA

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:05.115
AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO

02:42:05.182 --> 02:42:07.551
BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT AN API

02:42:07.617 --> 02:42:09.586
PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS OTHERS TO

02:42:09.653 --> 02:42:12.122
ACT. I THINK I THINK WE'RE

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:13.557
WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IN

02:42:13.623 --> 02:42:17.394
THE NEAR FUTURE- A DESTRUCTIVE

02:42:17.461 --> 02:42:20.730
CAPABILITY. THROUGH API TO

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:22.933
ACTIVE IN REAL TIME DATA ABOUT

02:42:22.999 --> 02:42:26.303
ANYONE IN A SECURE MANNER- WITH

THE APPROPRIATE- YOU KNOW. A

02:42:28.672 --> 02:42:30.507
PROTECTION PLAN ON ALL THAT SO

02:42:30.574 --> 02:42:31.308
I THINK THAT IS A VERY

02:42:31.374 --> 02:42:34.511
DIFFERENT WAY. OF CONSIDERING

02:42:34.578 --> 02:42:37.814
BATES TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF.

02:42:37.881 --> 02:42:40.217
SENDING A QUERY AND WAITING FOR

02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:42.552
A RESPONSE TO COME BACK. OR ITS

02:42:42.619 --> 02:42:44.454
SUMMARY DATA TO COME BACK INTO-

02:42:44.521 --> 02:42:48.558
COMPLEX- DATA STRUCTURE FORMAT.

02:42:48.625 --> 02:42:50.594
AND HAVING TO RECEIVE THAT DATA

02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:52.496
AND OPEN IT AND REVIEW IT. IN

02:42:52.562 --> 02:42:55.665
ANOTHER CHRONIC- OF BIO AT THE

02:42:55.732 --> 02:42:58.235
OTHER END I THINK BIG MEAL API

02:42:58.301 --> 02:42:59.970
TECHNOLOGIES ARE USING

02:43:00.036 --> 02:43:06.977
'UALLY

02:43:07.043 --> 02:43:07.978
YOU AT TI ARE GOING TO. THEY'RE

02:43:08.044 --> 02:43:10.080
VERY QUICKLY DESCRIBE WAY.

02:43:10.147 --> 02:43:13.583
WORTH THINKING THAT THE YOU

02:43:13.650 --> 02:43:15.685
KNOW TRADITIONAL MODELS OF HIV.

02:43:15.752 --> 02:43:19.756
SO HOW HOW NOW DO YOU AT WITH

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:20.991
KAISER INTEGRATE NETWORK

02:43:21.057 --> 02:43:23.260
SERVICES- OUT OF NETWORK

02:43:23.326 --> 02:43:25.295
SERVICES WITH YOUR ENROLLEE SAY

02:43:25.362 --> 02:43:27.931
SOMEONE GOES OUT OF NETWORK FOR

02:43:27.998 --> 02:43:28.665
SOMETHING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:43:28.732 --> 02:43:30.834
RELATED HOW DO YOU EXCHANGE

02:43:30.901 --> 02:43:32.169
INFORMATION BACK AND FORTH

02:43:32.235 --> 02:43:34.237
THERE THAT DOES THAT DOES THAT

02:43:34.304 --> 02:43:35.772
DOES IS THAT CAN THE PROVIDER

ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE

02:43:37.474 --> 02:43:39.342
PATIENT DO YOU GET DO YOU GET

02:43:39.409 --> 02:43:40.977
INFORMATION FROM THE PROVIDER

02:43:41.044 --> 02:43:43.914
HOW DOES THAT WORK- SENT IT IN

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:48.885
IN. YES WELL YES WE DO CONNECT

02:43:48.952 --> 02:43:50.320
TO OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS

02:43:50.387 --> 02:43:52.622
THAT THEY MENTIONED WE- HAVE

02:43:52.689 --> 02:43:56.293
OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED- OUT OF

02:43:56.359 --> 02:43:57.861
NETWORK PROVIDER OR NON KAISER

02:43:57.928 --> 02:44:02.766
PROVIDERS- WE USE- HORRIFIED.

02:44:02.832 --> 02:44:03.967
SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF WE

PROVIDERS WE USE THE. WE NEED

02:44:17.714 --> 02:44:20.650
TO HEY- PROVIDER THAT IS USING

02:44:20.717 --> 02:44:25.121
ALSO THE SAME- YOU KNOW

02:44:25.188 --> 02:44:25.755
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM

02:44:25.822 --> 02:44:28.592
THAT WE USE- MEANING BASICALLY

02:44:28.658 --> 02:44:31.494
AN EPIC PRODUCT WE USE THE EPIC

02:44:31.561 --> 02:44:32.862
NETWORK TO CONNECT TO THEM AS

02:44:32.929 --> 02:44:36.099
WELL SO WE HAVE WE REACHED THE

02:44:36.166 --> 02:44:37.534
PROVIDERS THAT WE NEED TO

02:44:37.601 --> 02:44:40.971
COMMUNICATE WITH- IN DIFFERENT

02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:42.539
WAYS- AND- IN A MANNER THAT

02:44:42.606 --> 02:44:44.808
THEY ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

02:44:44.874 --> 02:44:48.078
WITH THAT. AND SO DID YOU KNOW.

02:44:48.144 --> 02:44:50.080
BY I SAID WE HAVE. A HUNDRED

02:44:50.146 --> 02:44:52.782
AND FIVE MILLION- INSTANCES OF

02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:54.551
EXCHANGING DATA GAP IN

TWENTY- THROUGH THE VARIOUS

02:44:58.788 --> 02:45:02.025
NETWORKS YOU KNOW USING. FAQ

02:45:02.092 --> 02:45:03.293
HEALTH EXCHANGE WHICH IS THE

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:05.395
NATIONAL NETWORK DIRECT

02:45:05.462 --> 02:45:09.032
EXCHANGES- CAREQUALITY- AND ALL

02:45:09.099 --> 02:45:11.134
THOSE OTHER ENTITIES THAT AE

02:45:11.201 --> 02:45:14.371
IN ALL THE OTHER. ARE ABLE TO

02:45:14.437 --> 02:45:16.673
COMMUNICATE BACK WITH UP SO

02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:20.110
THIS. TRULY WORKING I MEAN IF

02:45:20.176 --> 02:45:22.212
THAT IF THAT IS THE REALITY. SO

02:45:22.279 --> 02:45:24.247
YEAH I IN YOUR IN YOUR COMMENTS

02:45:24.314 --> 02:45:26.182
YOU SAID THAT YOU BELIEVE THE

02:45:26.249 --> 02:45:28.084
SYSTEM IS AND I QUOTE. WHAT I

02:45:28.151 --> 02:45:31.421
HEARD IS ROBUST AND WORKS WELL.

02:45:31.488 --> 02:45:33.790
BUT YET YOU JUST ILLUSTRATED

02:45:33.857 --> 02:45:36.326
FOR DIFFERENT. WAYS THAT AN

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:37.360
OUTSIDE OF OUT OF NETWORK

02:45:37.427 --> 02:45:38.461
PROVIDER MIGHT HAVE TO

02:45:38.528 --> 02:45:39.729
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU THAT

02:45:39.796 --> 02:45:43.600
DOESN'T FEEL VERY SEAMLESS. AND

02:45:43.667 --> 02:45:47.404
I'D NOT SURE THAT. THAT WHAT

02:45:47.470 --> 02:45:48.238
WOULD BE THE WHAT IS THE

02:45:48.305 --> 02:45:52.042
OBJECTION THEN TO AN INTEGRATED

02:45:52.108 --> 02:45:54.277
STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION

02:45:54.344 --> 02:45:57.247
EXCHANGE. THAT IS A SINGLE

02:45:57.314 --> 02:46:04.988
POINT. OF INFORMATION. WELL I

02:46:05.055 --> 02:46:07.991
THINK THEY DIDN'T GET BETTER I

02:46:08.058 --> 02:46:09.526
MEAN I THINK THAT TURNITIN OR

02:46:09.592 --> 02:46:14.297
THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- TWO-

02:46:14.364 --> 02:46:16.232
ELIMINATE ALL THE NETWORKS AND

02:46:16.299 --> 02:46:18.735
YES THAT LEAVES ONE- THAT

02:46:18.802 --> 02:46:21.271
EVERYBODY USES IN THIS STATE

02:46:21.338 --> 02:46:23.039
AND I THINK. WE HEARD

02:46:23.106 --> 02:46:24.841
THROUGHOUT THE TESTIMONY OF

02:46:24.908 --> 02:46:26.509
SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL.

02:46:26.576 --> 02:46:29.079
HOW THAT. I MEAN THAT THAT'S I

02:46:29.145 --> 02:46:30.447
MEAN BASICALLY EVERYBODY TALKED

02:46:30.513 --> 02:46:33.283
ABOUT THE NEED TO LEVERAGE DAY

02:46:33.350 --> 02:46:35.018
INVESTMENT THAN THE PERSPECTIVE

02:46:35.085 --> 02:46:37.387
THAT WE'VE DONE. AND EVEN

02:46:37.454 --> 02:46:39.522
THOUGH IT DOES NOT SEEM LESS I

02:46:39.589 --> 02:46:41.758
THINK IT IS MORE SIMPLIFIED

02:46:41.825 --> 02:46:45.929
THAT NEED. IT IS THE PERCEIVED.

02:46:45.995 --> 02:46:47.697
I'M I THINK IT WITH THE NEWER

02:46:47.764 --> 02:46:49.632
TECHNOLOGIES THE NEW YORK I DID

02:46:49.699 --> 02:46:51.968
USE OF IT REQUIRE API INTERFACE

02:46:52.035 --> 02:46:55.004
AND- HM SEVEN FIVE STANDARDS

02:46:55.071 --> 02:46:57.741
AND- AND THE DATA THAT THE U.

02:46:57.807 --> 02:46:59.209
S. T. I. DATA SAID. I THINK

02:46:59.275 --> 02:47:00.343
IT'S EVEN GOING TO BE MORE

02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:03.346
SEAMLESS TO. ACHIEVE THAT AND

02:47:03.413 --> 02:47:04.681
SO PEOPLE AT THE END ARE GOING

02:47:04.748 --> 02:47:07.050
TO BE ABLE TO. RIGHT NOW WE

02:47:07.117 --> 02:47:09.386
COMMIT WE CONNECT TO FOR FIVE

02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:10.720
DAYS OF THE BIG MAJOR NATIONAL

02:47:10.787 --> 02:47:12.956
NETWORK. I THINK ONE OF THE

02:47:13.022 --> 02:47:15.558
GOALS IN THE FUTURE THROUGH

02:47:15.625 --> 02:47:17.627
NATIONAL EFFORTS BIKE- THE

02:47:17.694 --> 02:47:19.496
TRUSTED EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK. AND

02:47:19.562 --> 02:47:21.731
COMMON AGREEMENT EACH THAT

02:47:21.798 --> 02:47:22.832
PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY

02:47:22.899 --> 02:47:29.406
TO- YOU KNOW JOIN ONE. HIV THE

02:47:29.472 --> 02:47:32.041
LAW H. I. ORIGINALLY YES THEY

02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:34.344
THEY TELL YOU. HIV I WILL BE

02:47:34.411 --> 02:47:36.045
ABLE TO COME. WITH ANYBODY ELSE

02:47:36.112 --> 02:47:39.249
NOT JUST THE ONE LOCAL.

02:47:39.315 --> 02:47:41.384
REGIONAL OR STATE OKAY BUT A

02:47:41.451 --> 02:47:45.155
THE NATION SO- IT IN REALITY

02:47:45.221 --> 02:47:46.790
THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE

02:47:46.856 --> 02:47:50.160
NETWORKS. IS WORKING IN WORKING

02:47:50.226 --> 02:47:52.929
MOST MORE SEAMLESSLY THAT IT.

02:47:52.996 --> 02:47:56.332
APPEARS IT IS PERCEIVED TO BE

02:47:56.399 --> 02:47:58.134
COMPLEX BECAUSE THERE'S

02:47:58.201 --> 02:47:59.102
MULTIPLE NETWORKS CONNECTED

02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:02.038
BUT- THERE ARE MANY I GET

02:48:02.105 --> 02:48:03.473
EXAMPLES IN OTHER INDUSTRIES

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:04.641
WHERE DEATH IS THE PAINT

02:48:04.707 --> 02:48:06.242
MULTIPLE NETWORKS CONNECTED TO

02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:08.578
EACH OTHER AND STILL WORKING-

02:48:08.645 --> 02:48:12.982
SO ANYWAY I BELIEVE THAT- FROM.

02:48:13.049 --> 02:48:16.886
OUR PERSPECTIVE- THAT THERE IS

02:48:16.953 --> 02:48:19.589
REALLY NO NEED TO RIP UP REFUND

02:48:19.656 --> 02:48:21.257
REPLACE ALL THESE EFFORTS THAT

02:48:21.324 --> 02:48:23.460
HAVE HAPPENED AND DEDICATE THE

02:48:23.526 --> 02:48:26.362
READY NOT LIKE TO RIVERSIDE AND

02:48:26.429 --> 02:48:28.965
LIKE ALL OTHER ONES- I'M TRYING

02:48:29.032 --> 02:48:32.602
TO CREATE. A NEW STATEWIDE

02:48:32.669 --> 02:48:37.240
SINGLE CENTRALIZED SYSTEM. THAT

02:48:37.307 --> 02:48:39.075
WORKS PRIMARILY WITHIN

02:48:39.142 --> 02:48:41.511
CALIFORNIA. I'M WHENEVER

02:48:41.578 --> 02:48:42.612
THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF

02:48:42.679 --> 02:48:44.247
CALIFORNIA THEN THAT MIGHT BE

02:48:44.314 --> 02:48:45.915
CONNECTED TO OTHER NETWORK OF

02:48:45.982 --> 02:48:46.816
WELL WHAT THAT'S ALREADY

02:48:46.883 --> 02:48:52.555
HAPPENING. WITH THE NATIONAL

02:48:52.622 --> 02:48:53.523
NETWORK. I THINK THAT THE CHAO

02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:55.758
IS AND I GO BACK TO- THE FACT

02:48:55.825 --> 02:48:57.060
THAT THERE ARE AREAS OF THE

02:48:57.126 --> 02:48:59.062
STATE THAT ARE NOT IS

02:48:59.128 --> 02:49:01.264
INTEGRATED AS AND THAT THE

02:49:01.331 --> 02:49:03.233
SYSTEM ISN'T AS ROBUST AND

02:49:03.299 --> 02:49:06.536
ISN'T WORKING AS WELL AS YOU AS

02:49:06.603 --> 02:49:08.838
YOU. AS AS YOU HAVE SAID. OUR

02:49:08.905 --> 02:49:09.706
TO THE BAY AREA ARE NOT

02:49:09.772 --> 02:49:11.541
CONNECTED. THEY'RE NOT THEY

02:49:11.608 --> 02:49:12.342
DON'T COULD THEY DON'T

02:49:12.408 --> 02:49:13.910
COMMUNICATE WELL PARTS OF

02:49:13.977 --> 02:49:15.345
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE

02:49:15.411 --> 02:49:17.580
INLAND EMPIRE ARE NOT CONNECTED

02:49:17.647 --> 02:49:18.781
AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WORK

02:49:18.848 --> 02:49:21.951
REALLY WELL. SO IN SPITE OF

02:49:22.018 --> 02:49:23.253
YOUR BELIEF THAT THE SYSTEM IS

02:49:23.319 --> 02:49:25.054
ROBUST AND WORKS WELL IT'S NOT

02:49:25.121 --> 02:49:26.356
WORKING WELL FOR EVERYONE IT

02:49:26.422 --> 02:49:28.224
MIGHT BE YOU KNOW YOUR SYSTEM

02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:29.893
MAY BE WORKING WELL FOR YOU.

02:49:29.959 --> 02:49:31.294
AND OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS MAYBE

02:49:31.361 --> 02:49:33.196
WORKING WELL FOR THEM BUT IT'S

02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:34.664
NOT ALL WORKING WELL FOR

02:49:34.731 --> 02:49:36.666
EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA. YOU

02:49:36.733 --> 02:49:38.735
SAID YOU YOU **** YOU YOU YOU

02:49:38.801 --> 02:49:39.936
CONTRACT OUT WITH ARE YOU WORK

02:49:40.003 --> 02:49:41.871
AT WITH TWENTY SIX HUNDRED

02:49:41.938 --> 02:49:43.573
OUTSIDE PROVIDERS I BELIEVE

02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:46.042
THAT WAS THE NUMBER YOU GAVE ME.

02:49:46.109 --> 02:49:47.544
OVER TWENTY. TWENTY SIX

02:49:47.610 --> 02:49:49.579
HUNDRED. RIVERSIDE MEDICAL

02:49:49.646 --> 02:49:52.181
ASSOCIATION HAS FOUR THOUSAND.

02:49:52.248 --> 02:49:55.451
DOCTORS WE PROBABLY HAVE IN THE

02:49:55.518 --> 02:50:00.156
STATE. SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY

02:50:00.223 --> 02:50:02.559
THOUSAND MEDICAL PROVIDERS. BUT

02:50:02.625 --> 02:50:04.093
YOU'RE ONLY TALKING TO TWENTY

02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:06.729
SIX HUNDRED YOU SAID. YOU ONLY

02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:09.332
CUT SO ON THAT DOES IT FEEL

02:50:09.399 --> 02:50:11.000
TERRIBLY COLLABORATIVE SO

02:50:11.067 --> 02:50:15.471
THAT'S THE POINT. SO WHAT. AND

02:50:15.538 --> 02:50:17.507
WHEN I THINK TWENTY SIX HUNDRED

02:50:17.574 --> 02:50:18.007
ON THE TWENTY FIFTH THE

02:50:18.074 --> 02:50:20.410
DIVISIONAL POSITION- I MEAN FOR

02:50:20.476 --> 02:50:22.145

REASON IT IS AND NOT BECAUSE OF

02:51:28.144 --> 02:51:29.379
THE SYSTEM'S NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:51:29.445 --> 02:51:31.247

LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND

02:54:26.222 --> 02:54:28.024
LOOKING AT- WHAT KINDS OF DATA

02:54:28.090 --> 02:54:30.126
EXCHANGE WE NEED TO DO TO

02:54:30.193 --> 02:54:31.194

INVESTIGATED. I YOU KNOW WHAT

02:54:39.569 --> 02:54:41.871
EXACTLY WHAT DATA EXCHANGES DO

02:54:41.938 --> 02:54:43.539
THEY HAVE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN-

02:54:43.606 --> 02:54:46.108
IN- IN MARIN COUNTY THEY HAVE A

02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:47.476
DATE CHANGE WITH THE LOCAL

02:54:47.543 --> 02:54:48.644
HOSPITAL TO GET TO FIND OUT

02:54:48.711 --> 02:54:50.746
WHEN THE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN-

02:54:50.813 --> 02:54:53.249
ADMIT ADMITTED DISCHARGED AND

02:54:53.316 --> 02:54:54.550
THEY HAVE AND THAT'S REAL

02:54:54.617 --> 02:54:56.018
IMPORTANT FOR YOU KNOW DOING

02:54:56.085 --> 02:54:57.553
FOR THESE HIGH RISK PATIENTS

02:54:57.620 --> 02:54:58.888
AND THEN THEY ALSO HELP US AT

02:54:58.955 --> 02:55:00.256
THE EXCHANGE WITH THEIR

02:55:00.323 --> 02:55:01.924
HOUSING. MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

02:55:01.991 --> 02:55:04.193
SYSTEM- AND SO THEY THEY THEY

02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:05.528
FOUND OUT THAT THOSE ARE SORT

02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:07.129
OF A TWO CORE INTERFACES DAY

02:55:07.196 --> 02:55:09.866
THAT THEY MOST NEED NOW- THAN

02:55:09.932 --> 02:55:10.867
CONGRESSIONAL MY COUNTY

02:55:10.933 --> 02:55:12.435
INTERFACE WITH A NUMBER OF

02:55:12.501 --> 02:55:15.204
COUNTY LEVEL- A SOCIAL SERVICE

02:55:15.271 --> 02:55:16.572
FUNCTIONS THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR

02:55:16.639 --> 02:55:18.341
COUNTY SYSTEMS AND THEY STILL

02:55:18.407 --> 02:55:21.043
HAVE A LONG. LIST OF FUTURE

02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:22.411
ONES THEY'D LOVE TO DO BUT

02:55:22.478 --> 02:55:24.847
THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF THEM AND

02:55:24.914 --> 02:55:26.115
REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT BUT THEY

02:55:26.182 --> 02:55:27.083
BEGIN THE THING I'D LIKE TO

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:28.618
POINT OUT IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A

02:55:28.684 --> 02:55:30.152
BASIC CASE MANAGEMENT FUNCTION

02:55:30.219 --> 02:55:31.621
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND THEN

02:55:31.687 --> 02:55:33.122
YOU SPEND A LOT OF EFFORT TO

02:55:33.189 --> 02:55:34.724
BRING IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT DATA

02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:37.159
STREAMS. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:55:37.226 --> 02:55:39.228
THAT DATA WILL BE USED OR OR

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:41.731
REVIEWED REGULARLY ARE ACTED

02:55:41.797 --> 02:55:43.399
UPON IT THAT DATA ALONE WILL

02:55:43.466 --> 02:55:45.902
NOT CHANGE OUTCOMES THAT NEEDS

02:55:45.968 --> 02:55:47.470
TO BE IN THE IN IN THAT IN THE

02:55:47.536 --> 02:55:55.912
CONTEXT OF A INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:55:55.978 --> 02:55:56.545
THAT'S ABLE TO ANALYZE THE DATA

02:55:56.612 --> 02:55:59.015
THE- END OR- PRESENTED. IN A

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:00.950
WAY THAT. YEAH USER FINE. THAT

02:56:01.017 --> 02:56:03.753
MEANING- FINDS YOU. AND OF. AND

02:56:03.819 --> 02:56:04.320
SO THAT'S WHAT I THE THINGS

02:56:04.387 --> 02:56:05.421
WE'VE- IS THE- THE DESIRE FOR

02:56:05.488 --> 02:56:08.057
DATA TO BE- AND- IN. JUST SO.

02:56:08.124 --> 02:56:10.226
SHE OUTCOME. DOESN'T LEAD TO

02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:11.394
THAT CHANGED OUR COMMUNITY TO

02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:12.628
ACTUALLY HELP THE UNDERLYING

02:56:12.695 --> 02:56:14.130
SYSTEMS OR COURT IT'S BETTER TO

02:56:14.196 --> 02:56:16.132
HAVE FEWER EXCHANGES. WITH A

02:56:16.198 --> 02:56:17.433
ROBUST SYSTEM THAN A LOT OF

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:19.368
EXCHANGES WITH THE LESS. LESS

02:56:19.435 --> 02:56:22.872
ALIGNED. INCENTIVES UNLESS A

02:56:22.939 --> 02:56:24.307
ROBUST SYSTEM. SO FEWER

02:56:24.373 --> 02:56:26.575
SYSTEMS. SAVING HERE TO

02:56:26.642 --> 02:56:27.910
GREATNESS YES YOUR

02:56:27.977 --> 02:56:28.844
INTERPRETATIONS SO IT'S SO

02:56:28.911 --> 02:56:31.047
SINGLE SYSTEM WOULD BE MORE

02:56:31.113 --> 02:56:34.784
BENEFICIAL TO YOUR MODEL. WHOLE

02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:36.018
PERSON POPE PERSON CARE MODEL

02:56:36.085 --> 02:56:37.887
CORRECT WELL HERE'S THE THING-

02:56:37.954 --> 02:56:40.122
SO- EVERYONE OF THE WHOLE

02:56:40.189 --> 02:56:41.090
PERSON CARE COUNTIES THEY'RE

02:56:41.157 --> 02:56:42.458
FUNDAMENTALLY CASE MANAGEMENT

02:56:42.525 --> 02:56:44.927
SYSTEM SO SIMILAR TO- AND SO

02:56:44.994 --> 02:56:46.062
THAT CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

02:56:46.128 --> 02:56:47.897
COULD BE A STANDALONE SYSTEM

02:56:47.964 --> 02:56:49.031
LIKE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD

02:56:49.098 --> 02:56:50.032
SYSTEM BUT JUSTICE CASE

02:56:50.099 --> 02:56:51.567
MANAGEMENT OR MIGHT BE PART OF

02:56:51.634 --> 02:56:54.770
ANOTHER SYSTEM ONE COUNTY- USED

02:56:54.837 --> 02:56:56.439
THEIR PRIMARY CARE. HEALTH

02:56:56.505 --> 02:56:58.240
CENTERS IS THERE A PARTICULAR

02:56:58.307 --> 02:57:01.143
CONTRACT DIS AND THEY USE A

02:57:01.210 --> 02:57:02.011
CASE MANAGER SYSTEM THAT'S

02:57:02.078 --> 02:57:02.979
IMBEDDED IN THERE LIKE TRONIC

02:57:03.045 --> 02:57:04.714
HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM SO THOSE

02:57:04.780 --> 02:57:06.882
ARE THE END PRODUCTS SYSTEMS

02:57:06.949 --> 02:57:08.150
AND I KNOW WITH EACH AYE YOU'RE

02:57:08.217 --> 02:57:09.085
NOT PROPOSING THAT WE ALL

02:57:09.151 --> 02:57:10.086
THROUGHOUT OUR EIGHT YEAR

02:57:10.152 --> 02:57:12.121
MARCIN USE THE SAME PMR SURVEY

02:57:12.188 --> 02:57:13.656
THIS IS LIKE THEM HAVING THEIR

02:57:13.723 --> 02:57:15.224
OWN EMR. AND THE QUESTION IS

02:57:15.291 --> 02:57:16.892
HOW DO THEY INTERFACE WITH WITH

02:57:16.959 --> 02:57:19.261
OTHER- OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN

02:57:19.328 --> 02:57:21.163
THEIR WITHIN THEIR THEIR AREA

02:57:21.230 --> 02:57:23.532
IN THE PRIORITY I THINK IS THAT

02:57:23.599 --> 02:57:25.468
THAT HOSPITAL- JUST CHARGE

02:57:25.534 --> 02:57:27.503
ADMISSION INFORMATION IT'S ALL

02:57:27.570 --> 02:57:28.771
PART PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY A

02:57:28.838 --> 02:57:30.172
STEP NUMBER I MENTIONED A THIRD

02:57:30.239 --> 02:57:31.774
IT'S THE TRANCE STATE H. ARE

02:57:31.841 --> 02:57:34.110
YOU THAT- THE COLLECTIVE

02:57:34.176 --> 02:57:36.112
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES- EVERY

02:57:36.178 --> 02:57:37.313
PLATFORM WHICH REALLY IS

THIS WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN AND

03:14:27.822 --> 03:14:29.491
PRINT. IT IS. CRITICAL FOR

03:14:29.557 --> 03:14:31.726
THERE TO BE A STATEWIDE HIV

03:14:31.793 --> 03:14:33.328
NETWORKING CALIFORNIA SO THAT.

03:14:33.395 --> 03:14:34.629

WIDE EXCHANGE OF DATA THAT

03:14:44.873 --> 03:14:45.874
NEEDS NOT JUST PRIVATE

03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:47.442
INTERESTS BUT THE INTERESTS OF

03:14:47.509 --> 03:14:50.111
THE PUBLIC. IN SHARING DATA IS.

03:14:50.178 --> 03:14:52.547
BUSINESS TRUST. NOT NECESSARILY

03:14:52.614 --> 03:14:54.082
PRIVACY BUT BUSINESS TRUST

03:14:54.149 --> 03:14:55.283
WHICH IS ALL THE MORE REASON

03:14:55.350 --> 03:14:56.684
WHY. WHY THE LEGISLATION YOU'RE

03:14:56.751 --> 03:14:58.720
CONSIDERING IS IT IS ALL THE

03:14:58.787 --> 03:15:00.588
MORE IMPORTANT- BECAUSE IT WILL

03:15:00.655 --> 03:15:02.690
TAKE IN THE AGE. FRANKLY AND

03:15:02.757 --> 03:15:04.392
SOME STRONG INCENTIVES OR SOME

03:15:04.459 --> 03:15:05.627
SORT OF MANDATE FOR THIS TO

03:15:05.693 --> 03:15:07.962
HAPPEN. AND WE KEEP UP WITH

03:15:08.029 --> 03:15:09.464
THAT GOING ON BUT RESPECTED THE

03:15:09.531 --> 03:15:10.932
FEDERAL LAWS AND ESSENTIALLY

03:15:10.999 --> 03:15:12.801
WHAT IN WHAT IS BEING

03:15:12.867 --> 03:15:13.435
CONSIDERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA

03:15:13.501 --> 03:15:15.270
IS. IS UNLIKELY TO MAKE THOSE

03:15:15.336 --> 03:15:16.938
FEDERAL LAWS WORK BETTER.

03:15:17.005 --> 03:15:18.339
BECAUSE ON PROVIDERS ARE ALL

03:15:18.406 --> 03:15:20.075

A RANGE OF IMPORTANT PURPOSES.

03:15:28.883 --> 03:15:30.151
THE STATE OF THE ART. TO MAKE

03:15:30.218 --> 03:15:30.618

THE THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY

03:15:54.676 --> 03:15:57.112
BEEN THAT BY OTHERS IN IN THE

03:15:57.178 --> 03:15:59.614
HEARING- I THINK THE CHALLENGE

03:15:59.681 --> 03:16:01.316
AHEAD OF US HAS LESS TO DO WITH

03:16:01.382 --> 03:16:03.351
MOVING DATA I THINK API THE

03:16:03.418 --> 03:16:05.386
NATIONAL NETWORKS. WILL MAKE

03:16:05.453 --> 03:16:07.455
THAT PROCESS EASIER AND EASIER

03:16:07.522 --> 03:16:10.091
TO DO OVERTIME IT HAS TO DO

03:16:10.158 --> 03:16:11.693
WITH POINT EDITED TOGETHER AND

03:16:11.759 --> 03:16:13.995
DR MARK SAID SO ELOQUENTLY EACH

03:16:14.062 --> 03:16:15.864
AND PULLING OUT THE INSIDER

03:16:15.930 --> 03:16:18.166
IMPORTANT SO- MANIFEST MINEX

03:16:18.233 --> 03:16:19.934
THE REASON WE WERE ABLE TO RUN

03:16:20.001 --> 03:16:22.670

03:16:24.539 --> 03:16:28.009
DAYS TO HELP THE VACCINATORS

03:16:28.076 --> 03:16:29.410
TARGET THE PLUG THAT IN THAT

03:16:29.477 --> 03:16:31.446
MOMENT IT BECAUSE WE WERE

03:16:31.513 --> 03:16:32.413
ALREADY COLLECTING CONTACT

03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:33.815
INFORMATION WE WERE ALREADY

03:16:33.882 --> 03:16:35.917
COLLECTING HOSPITALIZATION WE

03:16:35.984 --> 03:16:37.719
ALREADY HAD ALL OF THE AND

03:16:37.785 --> 03:16:39.220
HEALTH INFORMATION AT OUR

03:16:39.287 --> 03:16:41.589
DISPOSAL. AND AS WE THINK ABOUT

03:16:41.656 --> 03:16:43.658
THE USE CASES THAT JONAS-

03:16:43.725 --> 03:16:45.860
HIGHLIGHTED THEY WILL ALL

03:16:45.927 --> 03:16:48.329

UP DATA FROM MANY SOURCES TO

CREATE CLEAN AND UNIFIED RECORD

03:16:54.435 --> 03:16:56.337
AND THEN CREATING POPULATION

03:16:56.404 --> 03:16:58.173
LEVEL INFORMATION FUND THAT.

03:16:58.239 --> 03:16:59.574
THAT'S THE THING I WANT THE

03:16:59.641 --> 03:17:01.009
STATEWIDE ENTITY TO CREATE FOR

03:17:01.075 --> 03:17:02.844
THE STATE AND I THINK THEY'RE

03:17:02.911 --> 03:17:04.445
SMART WAYS FOR THAT TO BUILD ON

03:17:04.512 --> 03:17:05.780
THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

03:17:05.847 --> 03:17:07.248
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THEIR

03:17:07.315 --> 03:17:08.816
SMART WAYS TO ACQUIRE DATA

03:17:08.883 --> 03:17:09.884
SHARING I THINK IT WILL

03:17:09.951 --> 03:17:12.153
REQUIRE. MANDATE AS WELL AS IN

03:17:12.220 --> 03:17:14.322
SAM. AND THEY'RE SMART WAYS TO

03:17:14.389 --> 03:17:16.157
DEPEND ON FEDERAL FUNDING BUT I
