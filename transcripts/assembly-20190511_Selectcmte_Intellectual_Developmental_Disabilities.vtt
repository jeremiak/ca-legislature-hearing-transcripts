INTO A WORKING REDWOOD COAST

00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:31.743

00:28:53.932 --> 00:28:55.233
THING RIGHT.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.204
SO PART OF MY ROLE IT REDWOOD

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:03.141
COAST IS TO GO IN TO SCHOOLS AND

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:05.276
TALKED TO STUDENTS WHO ARE WITH

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:07.178
DISABILITIES WHO ARE

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:12.984
TRANSITIONING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.190
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:21.593
KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT THEY

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:21.893
WANT TO DO.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.096
BUT IN ALL MY YEARS AND DOING

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:27.132
THAT I'VE NOTICED SOME BARRIERS.

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:29.501
SO.

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:30.168
YOU ALL GO TO SCHOOL AND PEOPLE

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:32.170
ASK YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:35.206
YOUR LIVES AND YOU WANTED TO DO

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:37.108
WHEN YOU GREW UP AND I'M SURE

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:39.210
WESLEY CHESBRO SAID I WANT TO BE

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:41.679
A STATE ASSEMBLY MAN AND THEN A

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:41.880
SET.

00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:45.316
A SENATOR I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:49.287
HAPPENED.

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:50.989
SO.

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:53.158
WHAT HAPPENS THOUGH WON'T YOU

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:54.959
GUYS GET THAT EXPERIENCE PEOPLE

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:55.593
WITH DISABILITIES DON'T OFTEN?

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.061
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES DON'T

00:29:57.128 --> 00:29:59.130
GET TO HAVE THE LAKE.

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:00.965
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:01.599
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.368
GOING TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES SO

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.170
I'D GO INTO SCHOOLS AND THOSE

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.238
CONVERSATIONS HAVE STARTED TO

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:07.472
HAPPEN.

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:11.342
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:11.643
ANSWER YES.

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:13.478
THEY HAVE NO Y. DE I AM THAT IS

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.313
REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE I THINK THE

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.083
SCHOOL SYSTEM SHOULD BE STARTING

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.252
PLANNING EARLIER WE SHOULD BE

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:23.121
GIVING PEOPLE MORE SUPPORT.

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:25.290
EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:27.825
OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT THEY

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:29.260
BETTER THEY ARE LIFE EXPERIENCE

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:33.231
AND I THINK THAT LIKE EVERYBODY

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:37.068
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:41.139
AND EMPLOYMENT REGARDLESS OF

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:45.310
DISABILITY OR NOT -- THE THINGS

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:45.643
THAT I ALSO.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:53.017
TEND TO DO IS GO IN -- TO IS GO.

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:55.153
SORRY I SKIPPED AHEAD OF MYSELF

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.288
ANOTHER BARRIER THAT I SEE IS

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:59.424
THAT WE HAVE WHEN LOOKING FOR

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.459
EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:05.129
DISABILITIES WE HAVE SOMEWHAT OF

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:07.165
A EMPLOYER BIAS.

00:31:07.232 --> 00:31:07.699
THEY ASSUME THAT BECAUSE

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:09.701
SOMEBODY HAS A DISABILITY THAT

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:11.636
THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF DOING SOME

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:15.039
JOB OR BECAUSE SOMEBODY MIGHT

00:31:15.106 --> 00:31:15.640
HAVE SOME KIND OF INTELLECTUAL

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.008
DISABILITY.

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:19.444
AND CAPABLE OF DOING SOME TO ARM

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.446
I STAND UP HERE BEING ABLE TO

00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:23.514
TALK TO ALL OF YOU.

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.283
BUT I HAVE.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.151
I KNOW THAT THE THINGS HAPPEN

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.387
BECAUSE IN VARIOUS STAGES

00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:31.089
THEY'VE HAPPENED TO ME YOU HAVE

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.991
NO IDEA HOW MANY OF MY FRIENDS

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:35.260
PEOPLE MISTAKE FOR MY YOU KNOW

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:37.095

AND SPEAK TO THEM INSTEAD OF ME

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:41.032
THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING I FIND

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:47.305
THAT ENTERTAINING -- BUT IT'S

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:48.006
IT'S A REALLY IT'S A REALLY KIND

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:49.540

THEY ARE VERY NICE PEOPLE AND

00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:03.388
GOOD FOR THEM BUT IT ADDS TO THE

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:05.023
DIVERSITY.

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.392
THE CULTURE AND THE PRODUCTIVITY

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:10.995
OF THAT BUSINESS AND THAT

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:11.396
CREATES REVENUE.

00:32:11.462 --> 00:32:13.064
AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:15.133
BUSINESS TO GROW.

REGIONAL CENTER FROM THE SCHOOL

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:15.076
PERSPECTIVE AND I'M SURE THE

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:17.179
REVERSE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE --

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:19.181
BUT YOU'RE WERE SMALL COMMUNITY

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:19.814

AND SO -- DOT THAT CLASSROOM

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:31.293
WHICH USED TO BE ONE CHILD EARLY --

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.361

TO THREE AND WE SERVE CHILDREN

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.467
WITH AUTISM BUT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:41.102
TO HAVE THAT DISABILITY

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:41.770
NECESSARILY THEY CAN HAVE SOME

01:20:41.836 --> 01:20:43.672
ARE LIKE CHARACTERISTICS SO THEY

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.307

AND BE SERVED BY THAT CLASSROOM --

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:54.082
AND THE REASON WE HAVE THREE IS --

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.516
FAMILIES LOVE THEM.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.116
AND THEY REALLY HAVE GREAT

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:57.419
OUTCOMES AND SO -- THEY'RE VERY

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:59.321

IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A PRESCHOOL

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.658
CLASSROOM AND IT FEELS LIKE THAT

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.360
AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.295
SOME SUPPORT TO THE FAMILY AS

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:07.896
WELL AS A CHILD BECAUSE WHEN

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:09.197
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIRTH TO

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:09.798
FIVE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOT

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:15.136
JUST SERVING THE CHILDREN.

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:17.172
BUT THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL.

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:17.706
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:18.340
WORKED REALLY WELL I DON'T KNOW

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:19.174
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:19.841
CLASSROOM ITSELF BECAUSE I DON'T

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:20.442
REALLY KNOW YOUR BACKGROUND.

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:21.343
AND EARLY INTERVENTION WHAT YOU

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:23.345
KNOW OR YOU DON'T KNOW -- AND SO

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:23.912
I THINK IF YOU COULD HAVE A

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.146
PICTURE OF WHAT THAT IT.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.382
AND I THINK D. M. BIGGEST

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:29.284
BENEFIT FOR FAMILIES IS THERE

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:31.019
NOT HAVING TO GO THROUGH

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:33.054
SEPARATIST CESSNA PROCESSES.

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:33.588
AND THEN BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.523
FAMILIES I HAVE FAMILY THAT

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.192
DROVE FROM RED WAY THIS WAY WEEK

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:39.261
THREE TIMES FOR ASSESSMENTS.

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:41.229
THEY HAD TO DO THAT TWICE FOR

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:43.031
EACH AGENCY WHEN THEY TURNED

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:45.100
THREE THAT CREATES A BEAR FOR

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:47.068
ACCESSING SERVICES.

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:49.304
AND SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE FINDING A

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:49.904
CLASSROOM THAT SET UP LIKE A

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:51.439
TODDLER CENTER IS THAT CHILDREN

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:53.441
ARE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES --

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:56.111
WHERE MAYBE THEY WERE ABLE TO

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:59.414
GET ENOUGH ABA PROVIDERS BECAUSE

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:00.015
WE KNOW THAT'S THAT AND SPACE

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.449
ACTORS FOR CHILDREN IN A SERIES

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:02.017
OF THE TALK MORE ABOUT THAT

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.051
LATER?

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:05.120
BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY NEED THOSE

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:05.754
SAYS BECAUSE FOR OUTCOMES LATER

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.155
IN LIFE.

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:09.491
IF WE CAN CHANGE OUR TRAJECTORY

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.026
THEY'RE GONNA NEED LESS SERVICES

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:13.061
AS THEY GET OLDER.

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:15.297
I'M IN ADDITION A THINK WHAT'S

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:17.299
UNIQUE IN A BARRIER RIGHT NOW

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:17.899
THAT WAS SPOKEN TO EARLIER.

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.701
IS THAT OUR COUNTY HAS THE

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.003
HIGHEST ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:29.177
EXPERIENCE NUMBERS IN THE STATE.

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:29.711
WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:30.178
LITTLE TWO YEAR OLD?

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:30.812
MAYBE THEY'RE EXPOSED TO TRAUMA

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:33.281
OR THEY HAVE -- OTHER DOMESTIC

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.150
VIOLENCE GOING ON IN THE HOME

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:35.784
THAT CHILD CAN LOOK LIKE A CHILD

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.218
AUTISM.

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:37.886
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ARE

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:39.721
YOU GOING TO DENY THEM SERVICES

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.289
BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIGH ACES

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.525
SCORES BECAUSE WE THINK IT MIGHT

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.460
BE THAT WELL WE DON'T DO THAT IN

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.228
THIS COUNTY.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:47.896
THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:49.497
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE THINK IT

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:51.466
MIGHT BE AND THAT'S SOMETHING TO

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:53.034
THINK ABOUT IS THE STATE AS WE

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.236
LOOK AT WHAT NEEDS ARE FOR

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:55.870
SERVICES AND REALLY THINK ABOUT

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:57.472
THAT MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT.

01:22:57.539 --> 01:22:59.641
IN ADDITION THE COUNTY OFFICE

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:03.244
HAS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ZERO

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:03.878
EIGHT MENTAL HEALTH COOPERATIVE

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:17.025
THAT MAKE WALKLEY INVEST HEAVILY

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:17.692
IN HAVE BEEN A PART OF IN REALLY

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:21.062
TRYING TO EDUCATE.

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:23.298
INDIVIDUALS THAT -- TO BUT IF

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.500
THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE NEEDS HOW

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:27.335
DO THEY GET INTO THOSE.

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:29.204
AND SO HAVING FUNDING FOR OTHER

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:31.473
QUALITY INTERVENTION I THINK IS

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:31.740
CRITICAL.

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.775
OR THAT PACIFIC DIAGNOSIS REALLY

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.543
THAT'S WHAT THE TICKET IS SET TO

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.412
GET INTO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES.

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:39.347
THE OTHER PART OF HIM AGAIN AS

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:41.216
THEY WERE RULES SO OUR FAMILIES

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:41.883
ARE TRAVELING REALLY FAR TO GET

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.251
TO THESE SERVICES.

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:45.453
AND THE OTHER BIG THING WHICH I

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.255
KNOW IT M. YOU KNOW PART THE

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:47.889
COUNTY OFFICE IS PARTICIPATING

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:49.424
IN A LOT OF LIKE RANTS RIGHT NOW

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:51.259
WE'RE PART OF THE CITY IT'S A

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:53.228
SUPPORT INCLUSIVE PRACTICES

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:53.862
GRANT AND WE'VE APPLIED FOR TWO

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:55.430
OTHER GRANTS. TO CREATE MORE

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.332
INCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITIES IS THE

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:59.434
LACK OF ACCESS TO GENERAL

01:23:59.501 --> 01:23:59.934
EDUCATION PRESCHOOLS.

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.636
AND CHILDCARE FOR MANY OF OUR

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.204
FAMILIES IF YOU.

01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:05.140
HAVE A CHILD WITH A DISABILITY

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:05.774
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A REALLY HARD

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.342
TIME FINDING CARE.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:09.577
AND A GOOD CARE AND SO -- IS

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:11.279
SPECIFICALLY THIS COUNT WE DO

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:11.880
NOT HAVE ENOUGH CHILD CARE

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:13.348
PROVIDERS FOR THE NUMBER OF

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.450
CHILDREN AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.352
ARE TALKING PROVIDERS CAN PICK

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:18.052
AND CHOOSE WHICH KIDS THEY WANT.

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:19.687
AND SO I HAVE A NUMBER OF KIDS

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.623
WHO HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT OF

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.191
PRESCHOOLS NUMBERS OF TIMES I

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:23.858
THINK THAT'S AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:25.627
THAT'S ALSO BEEN NOTED ABOUT THE

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.262
THE HIGH RATE.

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:29.264
THAT HIGH RATE HAPPENING -- SO

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.332
HAVING -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:33.134
HAVE MORE INCLUSIVE PARTNERSHIPS

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:35.303
WITH -- NO PRIVATE PRESCHOOLS OR

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.472
A NOTE AND STATE PRESCHOOLS AND

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:38.039
THINGS LIKE THAT WOULD BE

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.607
ANOTHER GREAT THING FOR THE

01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:41.409
STATE TO LOOK AT I KNOW STATE

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:42.043
PRESCHOOLS AND HAVE STARTS ARE

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.478
SUPPOSED TO SERVE A CERTAIN

01:24:43.545 --> 01:24:45.580
NUMBER OF KIDS WELL I'M WHO HAVE

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.182
SPECIAL NEEDS.

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:47.849
BUT WOULDN'T FRANKLY IT'S GOING

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.551
TO BE THOSE CHILDREN WHO ARE

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:51.252
MORE MILD NEEDS AT END OF

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:53.388
ACCESSING THOSE THOSE PROGRAMS

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:54.022
THE CHILDREN WHO ARE MORE UNIQUE

01:24:54.088 --> 01:24:55.123
NEEDS LIKE KIDS WITH AUTISM OR

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:57.225
OTHER TYPES OF DISABILITIES ARE

01:24:57.292 --> 01:24:57.859
GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME --

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.627
THOSE AGENCIES JUST DON'T HAVE

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.463
THE SKILL SET OR THE RESOURCES

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.331
TO BE ABLE.

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:03.898
TO YOU KNOW MEET THOSE KIDS

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:05.233
WHERE THEY'RE AT AND SO -- I

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.435
KNOW THAT -- WHAT WE WOULD LIKE

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:09.404
TO SEE MORE IS MORE PARTNERSHIPS

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:10.038
IS I'M WILLING TO PARTNER WITH

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.506
THE COUNTY OFFICE? TO RUN

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:13.441
CLASSROOMS -- SO WE HAVE THAT

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:15.643
AND FOR INCLUSION REAL INCLUSION

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:17.645
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE EQUITY

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:19.447
WE HAVE TO HAVE BE ABLE TO MEET

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:27.288
KIDS WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THAT

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:27.889
DOES MEAN THINKING DIFFERENTLY

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.291
THAT MEAN LOOKING AT YOUR

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:30.792
RESOURCES DIFFERENTLY.

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:41.636
AND THEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:42.270
MANDATED TO PROVIDE IT IS SOME

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:42.937
TYPE OF INCENTIVE TO DO IT -- SO

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:45.173
UP HERE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:45.773
THE BIG CHALLENGES AS YOU GUYS

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:46.241
GO BACK TO THAT ARE.

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:47.208
THERE REALLY STRUCK.

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:49.310
COOL IN CHILDCARE.

01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:51.112
WE'RE STRUGGLING TO GET KIDS

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:51.412
[INAUDIBLE]

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:53.314
I NEED.

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:53.882
IN PRESCHOOL THAT JUST GOES

01:25:53.948 --> 01:25:55.216
ALONG WITH YOU I MEAN YOU GROW

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:55.750
UP WITH THAT EXPECTATION.

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:56.351
THE KIDS YOU GO TO PRESCHOOL

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:57.552
WITH GREW UP WITH THAT

01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:58.186
EXPECTATION AS WELL THAT THAT

01:25:58.253 --> 01:25:59.754
JUST WITH NORMAL LOOKS LIKE IS

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:00.154
RANGE OF PEOPLE.

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:00.788
AND THEIR FAMILIES EXPECTED AS

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:01.589
WELL AND SO -- UP HERE THAT'S

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.291
THAT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING I

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:05.093
KNOW THAT'S CHALLENGING ACROSS

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:07.328
THE STATE -- I I TRAVEL AROUND

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:09.130
FOR THIS POSITION AND I GET TO

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:11.199
SEE OTHER PROGRAMS.

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:11.866
LAST WEEK WE WERE AN LA LOOKING

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:15.136
AT THEIR INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOLS.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:17.272
THEY'RE VERY RICH DISTRICTS THAT

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:19.240
ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT -- AND

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:19.874
THEIR CLOSE TOGETHER SO THEY

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:22.010
DON'T HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES

01:26:22.076 --> 01:26:25.079
THAT WE DO -- BUT SO YOU KNOW --

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:25.747
WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU AND IN

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:27.415
SOME WAYS IS THAT WHAT THE

01:26:27.482 --> 01:26:28.082
THINGS ARE GOING REALLY WELL AS

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:29.250
THAT COLLABORATION AND THAT

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:31.219
TAKES A LOT OF RELATIONSHIP

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:31.786
BUILDING AND I THINK THAT'S

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.488
CHALLENGING WHEN YOU HAVE?

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:35.723
YOU KNOW CASE MANAGERS WHO HAVE

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:37.625
HIGH CASELOADS THAT THEY CAN'T --

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:40.194
THIS IS OUR ENGAGE IN THE SAME

01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:42.063
WAY THEY WANT -- TO AND WE HAVE

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:43.364
LIMITED SERVICE PROVIDERS SO YOU

01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:45.767
OR MAYBE THE HAVE CERTAIN PEOPLE

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.402
AND THEY WANT TO WORK

01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:48.002
COLLABORATIVELY BUT YOU CAN'T

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:49.337
FIND OTHER PEOPLE TO WORK WITH --

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:51.472
BUT THEN AS WELL AS YOU KNOW

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:53.107
THAT.

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:53.741
AT THIS LOCAL LEVEL WERE REALLY

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.343
TRYING TO MAXIMIZE AND

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:57.278
EFFECTIVELY USE ALL OUR

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:59.414
RESOURCES AND I THINK THAT I

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.081
THINK THAT'S IT THE THING ABOUT

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:01.649
A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT'S

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:03.418
IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU CAN DO A

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:04.018
REALLY GOOD JOB WITH LIMITED

02:35:17.174 --> 02:35:19.410
SURPRISE ME AND SOME DON'T

BECAUSE I KNOW THE NATURE OF OUR

COMMUNITIES.

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:23.947
THE HIGH RATES OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS

02:35:24.014 --> 02:35:25.883
AND AND AND IT MAY BE MORE THAN

02:35:25.949 --> 02:35:27.751
TO ABIDE OF SOME MAYBE THREE OR

02:35:27.818 --> 02:35:28.419
FOUR DIAGNOSIS WITH SOME OF OUR

02:35:28.485 --> 02:35:31.188
CLIENTS AND AND THAT THE

02:35:31.255 --> 02:35:31.855
CHALLENGES THAT THAT THAT THAT

02:35:31.922 --> 02:35:32.089
FACES.

02:35:32.156 --> 02:35:33.757
WE ALSO HEARD THAT EARLY

02:35:33.824 --> 02:35:35.659
INTERVENTION WORKS AND WE ARE

02:35:35.726 --> 02:35:36.260
HEARING MORE AND MORE ABOUT

02:35:36.326 --> 02:35:39.296
EARLY INTERVENTION -- IN OUR

02:35:39.363 --> 02:35:39.963
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AS WE HEAR

02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:41.699
OF PEOPLE COMING FOR TO TALK

02:35:41.765 --> 02:35:43.467
ABOUT THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY

02:35:43.534 --> 02:35:45.335
CRITICAL THAT WE GET.

02:35:45.402 --> 02:35:47.471
THE RESOURCES AS EARLY AS

02:35:47.538 --> 02:35:48.005
POSSIBLE I'M A DENNIS BY

02:35:48.072 --> 02:35:49.606
TRAINING THAT'S WHAT I DID FOR

02:35:49.673 --> 02:35:51.975
ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AND I KNOW

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:53.811
THAT PREVENTION AND EARLY CARE

02:35:53.877 --> 02:35:55.479
MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE.

02:35:55.546 --> 02:35:58.148
AND ONE OF MY CONTINUAL

02:35:58.215 --> 02:35:59.216
FRUSTRATIONS AT THE STATE IS WE

02:35:59.283 --> 02:36:01.452
DON'T INVEST IN PROGRAMS.

02:36:01.518 --> 02:36:03.587
LIKE WE SHOULD SO MANY TH

02:36:03.654 --> 02:36:05.689
SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE OUR

02:36:05.756 --> 02:36:07.491
LINE ITEMS IN A BUDGET AND THAT

02:36:07.558 --> 02:36:07.825
EVERY YEAR.

02:36:07.891 --> 02:36:09.593
IF WE COULD INVEST IN AND

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.662
ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD ON

02:36:11.729 --> 02:36:13.864
PROGRAMMING WHETHER IT'S WHETHER

02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:15.866
IT'S DIABETES PREVENTION OR THE

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:17.568
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY

02:36:17.634 --> 02:36:20.204
OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS.

02:36:20.270 --> 02:36:21.805
THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE

02:36:21.872 --> 02:36:25.476
QUALITY OF LIFE AND PEOPLE'S.

02:36:25.542 --> 02:36:27.544
OVERALL HEALTH -- THEIR OUTLOOK

02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:29.747
ON ON THE FUTURE WOULD BE MUCH

02:36:29.813 --> 02:36:31.315
MUCH DIFFERENT AND AND IS IT IS

02:36:31.381 --> 02:36:31.815
A CONTINUAL SOURCE OF

02:36:31.882 --> 02:36:33.717
FRUSTRATION TO ME THAT WE DON'T

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:35.319
WORK THAT WAY.

02:36:35.385 --> 02:36:37.821
AND THAT WHY IT IS PARTICULARLY --

02:36:37.888 --> 02:36:40.023
REWARDING TO BE WORKING WITH --

02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:43.494
SOMEONE WHO SHARES THAT PASSION --

02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:45.195
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A HAVE

02:36:45.262 --> 02:36:45.829
A HAVE A PARTNER IN IN SOME OF

02:36:45.896 --> 02:36:47.598
THESE SOME OF THESE -- ENDEAVORS

02:36:47.664 --> 02:36:49.233
AS WE GO FORWARD.

02:36:49.299 --> 02:36:51.301
WELL WHEN I I'M REALLY GRATIFIED

02:36:51.368 --> 02:36:53.437
FOR WAS IT HE GOT TO SEE THE

02:36:53.504 --> 02:36:55.439
AMAZING STRENGTH IN UNITY OF OUR

02:36:55.506 --> 02:36:57.241
COMMUNITY.

02:36:57.307 --> 02:36:59.743
AND YOU DON'T SEE THAT IN A LOT

02:36:59.810 --> 02:37:01.545
OF AREAS AND AND IT IS --

02:37:01.612 --> 02:37:03.213
PARTICULAR HEARTENING TO ME WHEN

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:03.747
I COME TO OUR COMMUNITIES

02:37:03.814 --> 02:37:05.549
THROUGHOUT THIS THIS MASSIVE

02:37:05.616 --> 02:37:07.451
DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT.

02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:09.520
THAT IT IS ONE OF THE HALLMARKS

02:37:09.586 --> 02:37:11.588
OF RURAL CALIFORNIA IS IT WE

02:37:11.655 --> 02:37:13.457
STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE WE HAVE.

02:37:13.524 --> 02:37:14.057
TO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:37:14.124 --> 02:37:15.526
OUTSIDE RESOURCES BUT BY

02:37:15.592 --> 02:37:17.594
STICKING TOGETHER WE PROVIDE A

02:37:17.661 --> 02:37:23.300
QUALITY OF CARE FOR PEOPLE THAT

02:37:23.367 --> 02:37:23.634
IS DIFFERENT.

02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:25.502
AND BETTER I THINK THAN THAN A

02:37:25.569 --> 02:37:26.069
LOT OF COMMUNITIES SO -- WE

02:37:26.136 --> 02:37:27.538
HEARD ABOUT ASUS -- SOMETHING

02:37:27.604 --> 02:37:29.540
THAT I'VE BEEN ACUTELY AWARE OF

02:37:29.606 --> 02:37:31.742
THAT HUMBLE COUNTY HAS A IT HAS

02:37:31.809 --> 02:37:33.410
THE HIGHEST RATE IN THE STATE IS

02:37:33.477 --> 02:37:34.077
NOT JUST THE HIGHEST RATE IT'S

02:37:34.144 --> 02:37:37.514
TWICE THE AVERAGE.

02:37:37.581 --> 02:37:38.115
WE NOW HAVE A SURGEON GENERAL

02:37:38.182 --> 02:37:39.917
APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEW SOME

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:41.518
THAT WILL ADDRESS.

02:37:41.585 --> 02:37:43.520
SOME OF THAT SHE'S AN EXPERT IN

02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:46.623
ACES AND MICHAEL WAS TO GET HER

02:37:46.690 --> 02:37:49.560

02:37:49.626 --> 02:37:51.628
AND TO MEET WITH.

02:37:51.695 --> 02:37:52.229
FINALLY -- AND THE REASON I

02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:53.530
ASKED ABOUT AUTONOMY IN THE

02:37:53.597 --> 02:37:55.632
ABILITY FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO

02:37:55.699 --> 02:37:56.333

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.267
OUR BEST.

02:37:57.334 --> 02:37:57.534
IS THAT.

02:37:57.601 --> 02:37:59.636
ANOTHER FRUSTRATION IS THAT AT

02:37:59.703 --> 02:38:01.605
THE STATE WE DO A LOT OF ONE

02:38:01.672 --> 02:38:02.105
SIZE FITS ALL THINGS.

02:38:02.172 --> 02:38:04.308
AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE

02:38:04.374 --> 02:38:04.875
FLEXIBILITY WE NEED TO BE

02:38:04.942 --> 02:38:05.609

ITS WHATEVER IT DOESN'T.

02:38:13.417 --> 02:38:15.285
THE DISTANCES THAT WE HAVE TO

02:38:15.352 --> 02:38:15.886
TRAVEL FOR SERVICES ARE MUCH

02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:17.921
GREATER IT'S NOT AS NOT ONLY IS

02:38:17.988 --> 02:38:19.656
A MUCH GREATER DISTANCE TAKES

02:38:19.723 --> 02:38:21.692
LONGER SOMETIMES -- HEALTH CARE

02:38:21.758 --> 02:38:23.627
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS 30%

02:38:23.694 --> 02:38:25.863
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT IS IN

02:38:25.929 --> 02:38:29.366
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND SO

02:38:29.433 --> 02:38:29.900
WITH HEIGHT WITH GREATER

02:38:29.967 --> 02:38:31.902

NEED AS MUCH IT'S JUST THE

02:38:39.576 --> 02:38:41.445
OPPOSITE WE ACTUALLY OFTEN NEED

02:38:41.511 --> 02:38:41.645
MORE.
