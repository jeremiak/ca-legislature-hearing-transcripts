FOR MEMBERS HERE IN THE CHAMBERS. TODAY WE HAVE. ON CONSENT A. B. FOUR EIGHTY FOUR MEDINA ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE TWENTY SEVEN WORD AND ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FORTY SEVEN CORK WHICH BE TAKEN UP ON CONSENT ONCE A QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED. WE NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM BUT PRESENCE OF THE VICE CHAIR SO WILL BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE. MEMBERS THEN WILL GO INTO A FILE ITEM FILE ORDER WHICH IS FILE. I DON'T NUMBER ONE WHICH IS AB FOUR SIXTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN FRIEDMAN. I SOMEONE FRIEDMAN THIS DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION BOTH I THINK I'LL FEEL FREE 2% WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL- AB FOUR SIXTY IT WOULD PREVENT THE SALE OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS AND THEIR EQUIPMENT AS HAVING THE RIGHT OF A GUIDE TO SIGNAL OR SERVICE DOG. AND ALSO REQUIRES THE SALE OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS AND EQUIPMENT TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY DISCLOSURE SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND WHAT HAVING THESE ANIMALS ACTUALLY MEANS IN THE EYES OF THE LAW. THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT A HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEED FOR AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOG THAT IS NOT A GUIDE SIGNAL OR SERVICE DOG TO FINE AND LET THE HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER COMPLIES WITH CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS MEMBERS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL AND A SERVICE DOG AND THE TWO CLASSIFICATIONS DO NOT. ALLOW THE OWNER OF THAT ANIMAL TO HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF PUBLIC ACCESS IS DEFINED BY THE LAW THIS IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC AND BECAUSE OF THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT BUT THEIR OWN PRIVILEGE ACCESS AND PUBLIC SPACES. THAT CAN PUT OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND THERE ARE MANY REALLY SAD EXAMPLES OF THIS HAPPENING. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO USED. TRAINED SERVICE DOGS EARNED THEIR RIGHT TO BE IN PUBLIC SPACES AS A RESULT OF A RIGOROUS TRAINING PROCESS. THAT ENSURES THAT THERE SERVICE DOGS SATISFIED BEHAVIORAL STANDARDS UNDER THE ADA TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY THEMSELVES BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC IS SAFE. FROM WHAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE ANIMALS. THE FRAUDULENT SELLING OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOGS IN IDENTIFYING EQUIPMENT IS ENTITLING THE SAME ACCESS RIGHTS OF SERVICE DOG. NOT ONLY CREATES CONFUSION FOR THE OWNER OF THE ANIMAL BUT ALSO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH EIGHTY LAWS. ADDITIONALLY THE PERCEIVED NEED FOR THIS IDENTIFYING EQUIPMENT TO THE BUSINESSES STRESSING THIS REQUIREMENT. IS DEFRAUDING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS BILL TO ME CAME FROM HEARING A NEWS REPORT. ABOUT A FAMILY THAT HAD BOUGHT. I SUPPOSE AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL FOR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE ARTISTIC SON ONLY TO HAVE THAT SAME ANIMAL TURN AROUND AND KILL OTHER ANIMALS IN THEIR HOUSE. WELL IT TURNED OUT THAT THIS DOG HAD JUST BEEN PURCHASED HAVE BEEN ADOPTED FROM THE POUND A FEW DAYS EARLIER. NOT GIVEN ANY TRAINING AND SOLD TO THESE PEOPLE FOR THIS VERY FRAGILE AND VULNERABLE CHILD. THAT'S A TRAGEDY THAT IS FRAUD THAT HAS REALLY SAD CONSEQUENCES FOR EVERYBODY AND WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND- THE ANIMALS. AB FOUR SIXTY WILL HELP CURTAIL THE MISREPRESENTATION OF BUYING AND SELLING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOGS. AND THEY'RE IDENTIFYING EQUIPMENT IS HAVING EQUAL ACCESS RIGHTS AS TRAINED SERVICE DOGS. CREATING A SAFER PUBLIC SPACE FOR EVERYONE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS MORNING AS WELL AS CROSSMAN FROM CANINE COMPANIONS AND ROBERT DOW FROM GUIDE DOGS FOR THE BLIND.

THANK YOU- TO FILE ITEM NO ELEVEN THEN AS AS WE SEE NO ADDITIONAL WILL GO TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF IT'S OKAY WHICH IS A FILE ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY WILL HELP CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SAFEGUARD OPIOID MEDICATIONS AND REDUCE THE ACT OF PILFERING A POWERFUL ON RAMP TO THE NATION'S CURRENT OPIOID ADDICTION CRISIS. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE A PHARMACIST TO PROVIDE SCHEDULED TO HAND TO AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS I E. MORPHINE OXYCODONE FOR RENTAL AND IN A LOCKABLE CONTAINER. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT OF PRESCRIBERS ABILITY TO OPT OUT ON BEHALF OF THEIR PATIENTS IN CERTAIN CASES. PILFERING THE ACT OF SNEAKING A SMALL NUMBER OF PILLS HOPING THAT IT WILL GO UNDETECTED IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF USED OPIOID ABUSE. STUDIES SHOW THAT EACH YEAR NEARLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND SEVENTEEN. INITIATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE BY PILFERING MEDICATION FROM AND AN ADULT IN THEIR HOME. THE OUT DATED CHILD RESISTANT PRESCRIPTION VIALS CURRENTLY IN USE HAVE NOT BEEN MODIFIED IN NEARLY FIFTY YEARS. IN THE FEDERAL POISON PREVENTION PACKAGING ACT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THE GOAL WAS TO PREVENT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE FROM GAINING ACCESS TO ASPIRIN. TODAY THOSE SAME CHILD LOCKS ARE USED TO PROTECT MEDICATIONS RANGING FROM COUGH MEDICINE TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MANAGEMENT MEDICATIONS THAT ARE EIGHTY TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE. LEADING PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CALLED FOR IMPROVED PACKAGING OF OPIOIDS AND OTHER ADDICTIVE MEDICATIONS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. REQUIRING LOCKING PRESCRIPTION VIALS FOR POWERFUL NARCOTICS IS A LOW COST WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO MODERNIZE THE ANTIQUATED FEDERAL LAWS THAT ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING THIS NATIONWIDE EPIDEMIC. WITH ME TODAY ARE MARK BURKE AT WITH AND BE ADVOCACY AND SHERRY DAILY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANDY LOOK FOR CARRYING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION- AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE. ACCORDING TO RECENT STUDIES- ADOLESCENCE ONE ADOLESCENT BEGINS ABUSE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION EVERY MINUTE. TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR. THAT IS THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND THE DOCTOR REGULATE MENTIONS AT FOURTEEN THIRTY COMPARATIVELY ELIMINATE HELP FOR HIM- BY DOING THREE THINGS NUMBER ONE IT ALERTS THE PATIENT. OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THIS MEDICATION. NUMBER. TWO AT THE- DISINCENTIVE TO MEDICATION- STOPS FROM HAVE BIG THE- BILE CANNOT BE OPEN. AND NUMBER THREE A QUICKLY ALERTS THAT MEDICATION HAS BEEN WITH. AND THIS IS A CRITICAL BECAUSE IF BE PAGE- WHETHER THAT PARA- WORLDSPAN WERE SOMEONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE NO THAT THEIR MEDIC BEEN TAMPERED WITH. THEY CAN MEET. TAKE REMEDIATION. AND WE KNOW WITH TREATMENT- THE SOONER YOU BEGIN TO THE SOONER YOU FINE OUT THERE'S ISSUE THE BETTER CHANCE THERE IS LONG. TO SIX- EVERY STEP. HAS RE SHOWN THE- DRUG USE HAS A SHARPLY DURING LAST YEAR THE PANDA. SO THESE NUMBERS OF SIX BALLOT. AT ELEVEN EVERY.

CURRENTLY THE STILL BY WHOLE FOR LACK THAN A DOLLAR AND BY CAN. THE CAR OF A ONE MONTH SUPPLY OF A TYPICAL. DRUG RANGE ANYWHERE FROM HUNDRED AND EIGHT. TO SIX HOW DOLLARS SO AGAIN A VERY SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO ELIMINATE BILL FOR. ADDITIONALLY THIS PERFORMED IS TO BE A REAL. FOR THAT IN THERE TO. IS IN PLAY AND IS OPERABLE. AND USE FOR OTHER ISSUES.

FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL THREE EIGHTY FOUR THIS ALSO DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION THE BOTH SIDES. WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUBMIT MATURE MISTER CHAIRMAN BURS PRODUCTION PERCENT EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR. WANT TO CONFIRM THAT ALL THE ACCEPTED COMMITTEES TECHNOL MENACE IT ALIGNS. WITH THE REST OF THE BILL'S LANGUAGE I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK AND GUIDANCE ON THIS BILL. THREE YEARS AGO THIS COMMITTEE PASSED AB TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN. WHICH LLOWED VETERINARIANS DISCUSSED THE USE OF CANNABIS WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR STATE LICENSE AND ENABLE CANNABIS FOR THERAPEUTIC ANIMAL USED TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS. IN REGULATED DISPENSARIES. THE DISCUSSION PIECE OF AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY ONE ON THE PASSED BOTH HOUSES WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN EVER INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE ROLE FOR CANNABIS USE WITH THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS AND MANY PET OWNERS. ARE ALREADY ENGAGING WITHOUT A CLEAR RECOMMENDATION AND GUIDANCE FROM THE VETERINARIAN. IT IS TIME TO ALLOW VETERINARIANS TO BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND THE USE OF CANNABIS ON AN ANIMAL PATIENTS FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. ENABLE THESE PRODUCTS TO COME TO MARKET THAT ARE SAFE AND CLEARLY LABELED FOR PET USE RATHER THAN PET OWNERS USING CANNABIS PRODUCTS. DESIGNED FOR HUMAN USE ON THEIR PETS OR REVERTING TO UNDERGROUND MARKET. EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD TO ADOPT GUIDELINES FOR VETERINARIANS TO FOLLOW IN RECOMMENDING THE USE OF CANNABIS DERIVED. THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS ON AN ANIMAL WITHIN THE VETERINARIAN CLIENT PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. SIMILAR GUIDELINES FOR PHYSICIANS RECOMMENDING CANNABIS WERE DEVELOPED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. TO ENSURE CANNABIS PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR USE ON AN ANIMAL CAN BE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS IN A REGULATED MARKET. AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR ADDS THESE PRODUCTS THE DEFINITION- UNDER THE MINUTE MEDICINE ON. ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY YEAH. AND ALLOW THESE PRODUCTS TO BE. TO LICENSE. IF A DEER TO CANADA REGULATE ABOUT MANY THOUGHT **** LABELING. CONSUMERS CALIFORNIA WIDE ACCESS CANNABIS AND MANY PET OWNERS. ALREADY LOOKING AT KIND OF A PROVIDER PARTICULARLY THEIR PET. LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE PROVIDING PET OWNERS WITH THE TOOLS TO BETTER INFORM THEIR DECISION. ON HOW BEST TO USE CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR THEIR PETS PROMOTE SAFE. RESPONSIBLE USE. I BELIEVE THIS BILL STRIKES A REASONABLE BALANCE. BETWEEN THE EXISTING COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CANNABIS. AND THE ABILITY OF VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS PROVIDE CLEAR RECOMMENDATIONS GUIDANCE. FOR THEIR CLIENTS. AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND THE VETERINARY KIND OF THE NOIDA CAN I MEAN I CAN'T I MEAN. AS WELL AS BUSINESS GROUPS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. AND BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING ANIMAL WELFARE. AND RESCUE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. WITH WITH US TODAY ON THE PHONE. IS A DOCTOR TIM XU FOUNDER AND CEO OF THAT. CD AND THE FOUNDER OF ANIMAL CANNABIS COALITION AS WELL AS ELIZABETH ORECK. NATIONAL MANAGER OF INITIATIVES FOR BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OFFERED WOULD YOU KINDLY OPEN UP THE LINES FOR THE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES EACH. AND WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR SHE- GET MORE CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS OF THE CA. MY NAME IS DR JAMES. ANIMALS THAT MERION PRACTICE GENERAL MOTORS. OKAY MEDICINE. BARBARA THIRTY BENEFITS OF CANNABIS HUMANS AND PRACTICE INTO FIFTEEN JUST BUT V. D. SO THAT I CAN PROVIDE ANIMALS THE BENEFITS. AS A HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER I HAVE A MORAL AND ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO PURSUE IN UNDERSTAND ALL THERAPEUTIC AVENUES THAT PATIENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM. ANIMALS SUFFER FROM DISEASES JUST LIKE PEOPLE THEY STRUGGLE WITH PAIN ANXIETY INFLAMMATION NAUSEA SEIZURES AND END OF LIFE CHALLENGES. ALL THESE ARE CONDITIONS THAT WE KNOW CANNABIS CAN HELP WITH. OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS WE'VE SEEN COUNTLESS PET TO BE PROVIDED REMARKABLE BENEFITS FROM CANNABIS. IN SOME CASES BE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN LIFESAVING. SUCH AS WITH PETS SUFFERING FROM EPILEPSY AND HAVING DAILY SEIZURES OR ARTHRITIC PETS HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING AROUND WITH PAINFUL JOINTS. TIME AND TIME AGAIN BECAUSE PET OWNERS TELETECH CANNABIS IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THEIR PETS. BUT ARE THE SOURCE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION FOR PET OWNERS YEAH THEY'VE BEN PREVENTED FROM PROVIDING VALUABLE INFORMATION PET OWNERS NEED TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS FOR THEIR PETS HEALTH CARE. AB THREE FOUR RIFLES RESTORED THE PLACE TO THE VETERINARIAN BY ALLOWING THEM TO RECOMMEND CANNABIS AND PROVIDING SAFE ACCESS TO PET OWNERS IN A LICENSE REGULATED MARKET. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE HEALTH OF HUMAN PATIENTS BY ALLOWING THEM ACCESS TO CANNABIS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA COULD BECOME THE FIRST STATE ADVOCATE FOR THE HEALTH OF ANIMAL PATIENTS BY ALLOWING THEM ACCESS TO CANNABIS. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE CALIFORNIA THE LEADING ADVOCATE FOR ANIMALS IN OUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. WITH YOUR SUPPORT EIGHTY THREE FOUR WE CAN STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WITHOUT A VOICE AND MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR ALL CREATURES. THANK YOU.

NINE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WHAT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION WILL BEGIN WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HEARING THE COMMITTEE CHAMBERS- ASSEMBLY CHAMBERS WITNESS BEGIN OPPOSITION WILL LIMIT YOUR PRIMARY WITNESS TESTIMONY TO TWO MINUTES PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. WE'D LIKE TO THANK YOU THE ASSEMBLY CARLA FOR HIS KEEPING THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE ON THE FRONT BURNER AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR ALLOWS VETERINARIANS TO RECOMMEND CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR USE IN ANIMAL AND LEGITIMIZES EXISTING AND ALLOWS FOR NEW CANNABIS PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR ANIMALS. THAT SOUNDS GREAT. WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT WE ALL SUPPORT THAT. BUT BEFORE THINGS DEVELOP THAT WOULD LATER BE EXPLAINED AWAY AS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE ARE BOUND BY CONSCIENCE TO POINT OUT WHAT AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR DOES NOT DO. KHANNA'S DISPENSARIES ARE BOTH ADULT USE AND MEDICAL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ALLOW. MANY JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT ADULT USE AND ARE ONLY MEDICAL FOR EXAMPLE NAPA COUNTY IS MEDICAL ONLY. CONSEQUENTLY THERE ARE MORE MEDICAL DISPENSARIES THAN ADULT USE IN CALIFORNIA. AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR DOES NOT CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO INCLUDE VETERINARIANS IT JUST PROHIBITS DISCIPLINARY ACTION FROM THE VETERINARY MEDICAL. THEREFORE THE VETERINARIAN'S RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE WORTHLESS IN NAPA COUNTY. CHANGING THE DEFINITION AS WE PROPOSE WOULD INCLUDE ANIMALS AS PATIENTS UNDER MATH PERSON AND RIGHTFULLY SO BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS RECREATIONAL USE OF CANNABIS FOR AN ANIMAL. THE GOVERNMENT WARNING LABEL SAYS KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN AND ANIMALS THEY ARE DEFENSELESS HOWEVER WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION CANADA'S MAYBE INAPPROPRIATE THERAPY. BY INCLUDING ANIMALS AS PATIENTS IT ENTITLES THE RESEARCHERS WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM TO APPLY FOR A PORTION OF THE FUNDS ALREADY ALLOCATED BY PROP SIXTY FOUR. FOR RESEARCH UC DAVIS AS A FULLY LICENSED AND BA APPROVED FACILITY FOR RESEARCH ON ANIMALS. THURMOND STRUGGLING FOR FUNDING FOR EVEN BASIC PRE CLINICAL TRIALS FOR YEARS. THE TAX REVENUES THAT THESE NEW PRODUCTS GENERATE WOULD MORE THAN- THAN OVERCOME ANY FEAR DEFICIT OF A ON GOING RESEARCH. THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AS PROPOSED SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TO BE INCLUDED IN VETERINARY MEDICAL CANNABIS LEGISLATION UNFORTUNATELY THERE NEXT BOARD MEETING ISN'T UNTIL THE TWENTY SECOND OF APRIL. I WOULD EXPECTED MEMBER CARL WOULD BE HEARING FROM THEM AFTER THE BOARD MEETING. AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR IS WRITTEN OPENS THE FLOODGATES FOR BUT FOR BRAND NEW ASPECT OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. AND ALSO LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN FOR UNSCRUPULOUS. AND OF. READERS AND GREED WE PROPOSE THAT THE VETERINARY CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD IN MEDICAL RETAIL OUTLETS ONLY AND ONLY WITH A VETERINARIAN'S RECOMMENDATION. AS WE HAVE STATED EARLIER THIS IS NOT ABOUT ACCESS IT'S ABOUT SAFETY AND PROTECTION AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR SUGGEST THAT THE REGULATORS WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS. THE REGULATORS IN HERE TO THE LETTER OF LEGISLATION AND DID NOT EMBELLISH THE NOTION THAT THE REGULATORS WOULD INSERT SEEKING PRECAUTIONS IS FALLING. IT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR LITIGATION LET'S GET THIS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PUT THE TOOTHPASTE BACK IN THE TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE- HAVE A POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HEARING THE COMMITTEE CHAMBERS WAS INTO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE LIMIT YOUR TESTIMONY TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE BNP COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MANPOWER. MY NAME IS DR GARY RICHTER AND I REPRESENT THE VETERINARY CANNABIS SOCIETY A NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR ANIMALS. AS THE ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE CONSIDERS AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR. VCS THANKS THE COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MANPOWER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WHAT HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO BE LEGISLATION THAT BENEFITS BOTH PETS AND THE VETERINARY PROFESSION. AS CANNABIS BECOMES MORE BROADLY LEGALIZED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THIS BILL MAY BE. MAY ACT AS A TEMPLATE FOR OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATORS AS THEY CONSIDER HOW TO HANDLE CANNABIS FOR ANIMALS. THE VCS SUPPORTS THE SPIRIT OF AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR IN THAT IT PROTECTS VETERINARIANS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION FROM THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. WITH REGARD TO A VETERINARIAN RECOMMENDED CANNABIS FOR THEIR PATIENTS. THIS APPROACH IS A CONTINUATION OF AB TWO TWO ONE FIVE WHICH BECAME LAW IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALLOWING VETERINARIANS TO DISCUSS THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS WITH THEIR CLIENTS. THE VCS MAINTAINS VETERINARIANS NOT MARKET FORCES SHOULD BE LEADING THE KNOWLEDGE BASE AND GUIDANCE. CONCERNING MEDICAL CANNABIS USE FOR ANIMALS TO BE CLEAR. THE ONLY GOAL OF THE VETERINARY KIND OF A SOCIETY WITH REGARDS TO EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR IS FOR THIS BILL TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY. IN A VCS IS VIEW THE CURRENT FORM OF EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR IS LACKING NECESSARY SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT DANGEROUS TO ANIMALS. WHOSE OWNERS SEEK OUT MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR THEIR PET WITH OR WITHOUT A VETERINARY RECOMMENDATION. BECAUSE THE BILL FAILS TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM SUCH AS A WRITTEN RECOMMENDATION FOR VETERINARIANS TO BE THE ACTUAL DECISION MAKERS AS TO THE POTENCY AND STRUCTURE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SUPPLEMENTS TO BE ADMINISTERED TO ANIMALS. THE KEY QUESTION WHO DECIDES HOW MUCH CANNABIS IS APPROPRIATE MEDICINE IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE BILL AND LEAVES A GAP. THE BILL ALSO APPEARS TO DUPLICATE NOW CURSES TEN MILLIGRAM PER SERVING. FOR ELIGIBLE CANNABIS PRODUCTS INTO THE ANIMAL USE ENVIRONMENT. TO BE CLEAR TEN MILLIGRAMS OF THC FOR A SMALL ANIMALS SUCH AS A SMALL DOG OR A CAT COULD BE A LETHAL DOSE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ADMINISTERING CANNABIS TO ANIMALS MUCH LIKE WE WOULD TO A SMALL CHILD THAT IS NON VERBAL THESE ARE NONVERBAL PATIENTS WHO CANNOT TELL US HOW THEY FEEL. AND IN ORDER TO SEE IF WE GIVE CANNABIS TO THESE PATIENTS MEDICAL GUIDANCE IS. IS NECESSARY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME HERE IN THE CHAMBERS. AND NOW WE HAVE A JUST A NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. GOOD MORNING SUSAN TIVEN. LUCKILY IN LEGALLY. MY POSITION IS THAT I DO NOT SUPPORT AND LESS AMENDED THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME.

TWELVE OH FIVE NEAR KNOWS A NOTE TO A VICE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE KALRA COLLEAGUES WILL TURN TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY FOUR BY SEVEN MEMBER KILEY. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M PRESENTED A BILL THAT I HOPE CAN BE A POINT OF CONSENSUS. THAT COBIT ERA SANCTIONS SHOULD NOT BE EXTENDED. BEYOND THE CO VIDEO. NOW WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON HOW THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN MANAGED. I MYSELF HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT CRITICAL YOU MIGHT SAY. OF THE STATE'S APPROACH- TO LOCKDOWNS. AND BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS AND I'M SURE FOLKS HERE- AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH ME TO VARYING. DEGREES I WILL KNOW THE CALIFORNIA'S HAD THE STRICTEST. WALK DOWNS OF ANY STATE AND I TEND TO BELIEVE MOST PEOPLE DON'T TRULY BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN IT RIGHT. WELL THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES HAVE GOTTEN IT WRONG. AND EVEN THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID. QUOTE WE'RE ALL GENIUSES IN HINDSIGHT. THE PUTTING ALL THAT ASIDE. EVEN IF YOU ARE OF THE MIND THAT THE STATE HAS GOTTEN EVERYTHING EXACTLY RIGHT. AND ANY ESTABLISHMENT THAT WAS AT ANY POINT OUT OF COMPLIANCE WAS IN THE WRONG I STILL THINK THIS IS A BILL WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT. TO ESTABLISH THE VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE.AGAIN THAT COVERT ERA PUNISHMENTS SHOULD NOT BE EXTENDED. BEYOND THE COVERED AREA. THE QUESTION IS ADDS OUR ECONOMY REOPENS IS OUR APPROACH GOING TO BE PUNITIVE AND PETTY OR FOR GIVING AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WE FOCUS ON RETRIBUTION AND RETALIATION OR ON RESTORATION AND REVITALIZATION. MY BELIEF IS THAT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO SETTLE SCORES IT IS TIME FOR A MOVE EVERY OBSTACLE TO RESTORING THE LIFE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF OUR PEOPLE THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SPITE CERTAINLY NOT SPITE BACKED. BY THE FORCE OF STATE POWER. THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY FOUR. INSURERS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL. CANNOT RESERVE REVOKE A LICENSE FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COVERT NINETEEN A MERCHANT'S YOURS. UNLESS IT CAN BE PROVEN THAT A LACK OF COMPLIANCE. CONTRIBUTED TO THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROPOSAL. IN THE CONTEXT OF. WHAT OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS GONE THROUGH. SMALL BUSINESSES COMPRISE ROUGHLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE THAT WAS BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. AND STATE DATA RELEASED LAST AUGUST SURE THE CLOSE TO HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES WERE AT RISK OF SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. MINORITY OWNED ESTABLISHMENTS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AND AFFECTED THE SURVEY CONCLUDED WITH A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES OWNED BY AFRICAN AMERICANS DROPPED ABOUT DROPPING BY 41% LATINO OWNED BUSINESSES BY 32% IN ASIAN OWNED BUSINESSES BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. ROUGHLY 36% OF IMMIGRANT OWNED BUSINESSES WENT UNDER AS ONE EXAMPLE TAKE THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY LAST AUGUST ASIDE FROM THE THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS THAT ALREADY GONE OUT OF BUSINESS 30% SAID THEY WOULD EITHER LOSE THE RESTAURANTS PERMANENTLY WILL BE REQUIRED TO DOWNSIZE. OPERATIONS THIS WAS IN EFFECT NOT JUST OF THE PANDEMIC ITSELF. BUT OF COVERT NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS THE WERE OFTEN UNCLEAR. AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY CHANGING. AS A RESULT MANY BUSINESSES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER. WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE'S MANDATES. SOMETIMES THIS IS BECAUSE THEY WERE SIMPLY UNAWARE OF WHAT THE MANDATES OR UNAWARE THAT THEY WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. AT OTHER TIMES THERE WAS A GOOD FAITH DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE AUTHORITIES AS TO WHETHER THEY WERE IN COMPLIANCE AND IN OTHER OCCASIONS. YOU ESTABLISHMENTS WERE FORCED. THAT HAVE FACED AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE. WHETHER TO OBEY MANDATES THAT DIDN'T EXIST IN ANY OTHER STATE AND CLEARLY WE'RE NOT DOING ANY GOOD. OR WHETHER TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR EMPLOYEES. TO REJECT THIS BILL IS TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO PROLONG SUFFERING BEYOND THE LIFE OF THE VIRUS. AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. AND I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL ADDITIONAL REASONS WHY WE SHOULDN'T EXTEND COBRA ERA PENALTIES. BE ON THE COVERED AREA THE FIRST IS THAT WOULD BE A DEPARTURE FROM OUR CURRENT AND PAST PRACTICES. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE CAMPUS WHEN THIS STATE DECIDED TO REAL LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL CANNABIS WE DIDN'T SAY WELL FOR FOLKS THAT IN THE PAST WERE CONVICTED OF CANNABIS POSSESSION WE'RE STILL GOING TO CONSIDER YOU A CRIMINAL BECAUSE YOU NEWS AGAINST THE LAW AT THAT TIME AND YOU CHOSE TO USE IT ANYWAY. NOW WHAT WE DID IS WE SAID NOW WE'RE NO LONGER GOING TO CONSIDER YOU CRIMINALS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CLEAN SLATE AND LIKE THOSE CONVICTIONS CLEAN. IN THE SAME VEIN NOW THAT BUSINESSES ARE ALLOWED TO BE OPEN OR GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO BE OPEN. WE SHOULDN'T SAY WE'RE STILL GOING TO PUNISH YOU. FOR BEING OPEN IN THE PAST. WHEN YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. THE SECOND ADDITIONAL REASON TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. IS THAT IF WE PURSUE THE PATH OF A LICENSE REVOCATION OF KEEPING BUSINESSES CLOSED FOR PAST PRACTICES IT WILL FAVOR LARGE CORPORATIONS OVER THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. BIG COMPANIES HAVE HAD BIG COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE STATE BY STATE GUIDANCE ON EXACTLY WHAT THEIR FRANCHISES NEED TO DO- YOU KNOW THEY'VE HAD- THEY'VE BEEN DOING BY- I THRIVING STOCK MARKET AND THEY HAVE. A LARGE MARGINS AND RESOURCES. TO ABSORB THE COST OF SHUTDOWNS THAT SIMPLY AREN'T AVAILABLE TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND IF THE GOVERNMENT NOW ITSELF CAUSES ADDITIONAL SMALL BUSINESSES TO CLOSE. IT IS ONLY GONNA- ADVANTAGE THESE LARGE COMPANIES EVEN MORE. THE THIRD POINT I'D RAISE IS THAT THE PROPOSAL THE PRINCIPLE THAT IS IN THIS BILL IS IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE WHAT IT SAYS. IS THAT OUR STATE AGENCIES SHOULD FOCUS THEIR RESOURCES ON THOSE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY CREATING A PROBLEM SO THERE'S STILL THE OPPORTUNITY IT REPLACES PURSUE SANCTIONS BUT ONLY IF IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE'S BEEN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. I THINK THAT ACTUALLY WOULD GO A LOT FARTHER TOWARDS CURBING TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS THAT HAVING STATE BUREAUCRATS GOING AROUND SEARCHING FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS OR TARGETING BUSINESSES THAT PERHAPS THE MOST OUTSPOKEN- OR OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW THESE ESTABLISHMENTS OR- POLITICALLY DISFAVORED OR JUST END UP BEING UNLUCKY. AND THE FINAL POINT I'D RAISE IS THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POSTAL FOR RESTORING TRUST THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF DISTRUST BRED THROUGHOUT THE STATE- BY THE OFTEN EXISTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE IMPOSED. AND I THINK THAT THIS GESTURE OF GOODWILL. WOULD REALLY GO A LONG WAY. I WANT TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT- IF YOU WILL TO ADDRESS. A COUPLE ARGUMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD RAISED AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL. NOW THERE'S ALWAYS THIS IDEA OF DETERRENCE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THESE PENALTIES THERE IS A DETERRENT BUT THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T APPLY TO THIS SITUATION. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA- WHAT WE'RE GONNA ASK THESE COMPANIES THAT IS BUSINESSES TO BEHAVE BETTER THE NEXT TIME A ONCE IN A CENTURY PANDEMIC COMES AROUND THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING- THAT- YOU KNOW IS. IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE A RECURRING PHENOMENON. AB SECOND THING A POINT THAT'S ARGUMENTS AND REYES IS THAT THERE IS- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY PROVE. THAT BUSINESS WAS A CAUSE OF TRANSMISSION BUT I THINK THAT THAT VERY ARGUMENT IS A REASON WHY WE SHOULD DOPT THIS BILL ISN'T IS EVIDENCE ITSELF- THAT THE STATE HAS NOT BEEN PURSUING SANCTIONS IN A WAY THAT'S GUIDED BY PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED. WITH STOPPING BUSINESS ACTIVITY THAT CONTRIBUTES TO TRANSMISSION THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP A CONTACT RAISING SPECIAL TOOLS BY WHICH THAT COULD BE DEMONSTRATED. BUT MAIN ARGUMENT I HEARD AGAINST THIS IDEA. IS THAT. IT'S SOMEHOW REWARDING BAD BEHAVIOR IT'S UNFAIR TO TREAT THE SAME- BUSINESSES THAT DECIDED TO OBEY THE ORDERS AND STAY CLOSED. AND THOSE THAT DECIDED. TO OPEN. I POINT OUT FIRST OF ALL THAT EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT. THAT'S STILL NO REASON TO PURSUE THE NUCLEAR OPTION OF AN OF A LICENSE REVOCATION. I'D CERTAINLY POINT OUT THAT THIS IS AGAIN A DEPARTURE FROM LET'S SAY THE WAY WE'VE TREATED CANNABIS WHERE YOU MIGHT SIMILARLY REYES THE POINT WELL THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE WANTED TO USE CANNABIS WHEN IT WAS ILLEGAL BUT THEY OBEY THE LAW. AND SO NOW WE'RE TREATING THEM THE SAME AS THE PEOPLE WHO DID CHOOSE TO OBEY THE LAW. BY THE SAME REASONING. THE SAME REASONING WOULD APPLY HERE. THE FINAL POINT I WANT TO RAISE IS THAT THE WAY THINGS ARE BEING DONE RIGHT NOW IF WE PROCEED WITH THESE LICENSE REVOCATIONS FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS THERE'S A MUCH GREATER- THERE'S A MUCH MORE PERVERSE IN EQUITY. WHICH IS TO SAY THAT BUSINESSES THAT OPEN SAFELY ARE TREATED THE SAME WAY AS BUSINESSES THAT OPENED RECKLESSLY SO YOU COULD HAVE HAD A BUSINESS THAT DECIDED TO OPEN AND DID EVERYTHING IT COULD TO MAKE THINGS SAFE AND ELIMINATE ANY REAL RISK OF TRANSMISSION YOU KNOW THEY I. INSISTED ON MASKS THEY PUT UP THOSE PLASTIC DIVIDER THINGS- THEY DIDN'T DEEP CLEANINGS EVEN THOUGH THE CDC NOW SAYS THAT THAT. WAS KIND OF POINTLESS MANY OF ANOTHER BUSINESS THAT DECIDED TO OPEN IT WAS COMPLETELY RECKLESS AND PACKED PEOPLE INTO TO TAKE ORDERS YET UNDER THE WAY THINGS ARE BEING DONE NOW THEY'RE TREATED EXACTLY THE SAME DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE MISTER KIND YES I'M CLOSING RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND SO I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT EQUITABLE FRIEDMAN. THEN THAT ACTUALLY WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THIS BILL. BUT IF THE STATE'S GOING TO PURSUE PUNITIVE ACTION. THEN THERE SHOULD AT LEAST NEED TO BE A BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE PART. OF THE STATE AGENCY TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS HARM DONE. AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND- AS A WITNESS TODAY I HAVE DAVID BUTLER WITH UNITED CHAMBER ADVOCACY NETWORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR WOULD YOU KINDLY OPEN UP THE LINES FOR MISTER BUTLER MISS BUTLER UP TO TWO MINUTES. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. A GOOD MORNING CHAIR LOAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF YOU CAN. UNITED CHAMBER ADVOCACY NETWORK WHICH IS THE COALITION OF LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE ACROSS FOUR COUNTIES. HERE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OVER FIVE THOUSAND MEMBER BUSINESSES. EACH YEAR WE SURVEY MEMBER BUSINESSES DETERMINE THEIR NEEDS AND CONCERNS RELATIVE TO STATE LEVEL ISSUES. AND OVERWHELMINGLY THIS YEAR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND OPERATORS INDICATED THEIR BUSINESS AT BEEN. ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY STATE AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT DECISIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND NOW SEEK TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY AND REACHED OUT WAS THEIR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. FORTUNATELY IN OUR CITIESAND TOWNS ARE CHAMBERS HAVE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND STAFF. WHO REGULARLY BUT PARTICULARLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. HAVE WORKED WITH SMALL BUSINESSES TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE CHANGING MANDATE. DISTRIBUTE FEDERAL AND STATE RELIEF. AND ALTER LOCAL ORDINANCES TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS WITHIN SPECIFIC GUIDELINES. ARE CHAMBER MEMBERS AND LEADERS SEEK A SIMILAR REPORT LEVEL OF PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU. THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT YOU OVERSEE. IN THE PAST THE LEGISLATORS MADE CHANGES TO STRUCTURE AND PROCESS TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES MOST NOTABLY BY ESTABLISHING SMALL BUSINESS OF ADVOCATES WITHIN STATE AGENCIES. AND ENACTING FIX IT FIRST LEGISLATION ALLOWING BUSINESS OWNERS TO AVOID PURPOSE LAWSUITS. YOU CAN CHAMBER STRONGLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY FOUR WHICH IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY MENTION SEEKS TO REMOVE THE THREAT OF LICENSE REVOCATION TO BUSINESS OWNERS AND OPERATORS DURING THE CURRENT CODE EMERGENCY. UNLESS SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PARTICULAR BUSINESS. BY APPROVING AB FIFTY FOUR YOU'LL ONCE AGAIN POSITION THE STATE LEGISLATURE AS A PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESSES HELPING THEM AVOID PUNITIVE AND OFTEN ARBITRARY PUNISHMENT. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECLARED EMERGENCY THANKS FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I FELT MONEY BT FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR ANY ADDITIONAL. WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE NO FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEN NO ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE CHAMBERS OR IN THE COMMITTEE ROOMS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. IN IS YOUR MIND IF THEY'RE IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. GOOD MORNING TO REMEMBER MY NAME IS MICHELLE GIVEN WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVE AT THE STATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT YOUR HONOR STATE. CALLING IN IN OPPOSITION K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; FIFTY FOUR. STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH ORDERS ARE CRITICAL TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF DISEASE ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC LIKE OF THE NINETEEN. ENFORCEMENT OF THE BORDER THE COURT GREATER COMPLIANCE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENFORCEMENT BEGINS WITH EDUCATION IT DOES NOT START WITH CLOSURES AND ONLY ACTUALLY THE PENALTIES INCLUDED AFTER REPEATED INCIDENCES OF NON COMPLIANCE. NON COMPLIANCE COMES IN MANY FORMS AND CAN RANGE FROM EXCEEDING THE CAPACITY LIMIT. NEGLECTING MAPPING REQUIREMENTS OR FAILURE TO REPORT CRITICAL CASES AMONG OTHERS. REQUIRING AGENCIES TO PROVE A DIRECT CORRELATION FOR EVERY INSTANCE THE SCENARIO OF NONCOMPLIANCE AND TRANSMISSION IS NOT FEASIBLE AND RISK FURTHER SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ENDEMIC LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RELIED ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL WITH. A KEY PARTNER IN THAT EFFORT EIGHTY FIFTY FOUR WOULD PROHIBIT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT A HOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL PROVOKING A LIFE. FOR EVEN THE MOST EGREGIOUS PIZZA THE NOT QUITE. BECAUSE THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO FIRST BE TO BE ESTABLISHED AND THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY THINGS. DURING AN EMERGENCY QUICK ACTION CAN SAVE LIVES AND MUST NOT BE TENDER AND IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE A NO ONE ELSE IN Q. AND APPOSITION.

WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY FOUR BY MYSELF ALL GOING TO TURN OVER THE GAVEL TO OUR VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- PRESENTING AB. ELEVEN NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I AM PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY FOUR WHICH AS YOU KNOW OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS AREAS OF JURISDICTION OVER THE FISHERIES BUREAU. BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT THIS ISSUE WAS PUT BACK ONTO OUR RADAR WHEN THE FREE BRITNEY DOCUMENTARY WAS RELEASED IT SHOULD LIGHT ON THE MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE CONSERVATORSHIP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE DOCUMENTARY IS A TRAGIC STORY OF A TALENTED YOUNG WOMAN WHO REACHED THE HIGHEST PEAKS OF FAME. AND WAS LUCKY. AND THEN BECAME ISOLATED HARASSING ALSO CITED A POINT OF BREAKING DOWN. BUT THIS BILL ISN'T JUST ABOUT BRITNEY SPEARS SOME WOULD SAY TE CURRENT SYSTEM IS A CIRCUS. AFTER DOING OUR OWN RESEARCH ON THE CALIFORNIA'S CONSERVATORSHIP LAWS WE FOUND THAT A HUGE EFFORT TO REFORM THE SYSTEM IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX DID NOT TAKE EFFECT. DUE TO THE TOXIC. ECONOMIC RECESSION THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. IN ADDITION THE LOSS DID NOTHING TO HELP PEOPLE AVOID CONSERVATIVE SHIPS. CREATE RESOURCES FOR FAMILIES ARE PROVIDE FUNDING TO MAKE EXISTING SYSTEMS WORK BETTER. ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY FOUR CREATES A MUCH NEEDED OVERSIGHT IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM REQUIRES THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO COORDINATE WITH THE LICENSING ENTITY OF PRODUCERS. AND GIVES US MORE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE UNDER CONSERVATORSHIP. IT SHOULD BE CRIMINAL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE PLACED IN CONSERVATORSHIP MOST OF WHOM ARE SENIORS AND VULNERABLE TO ABUSE. LET'S NOT MAKE THIS AN OOPS MOMENT WE NEED TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. IT'S OUR PREROGATIVE AS MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS PASSIONS COMMITTEE TO GIVE THE FUTURES BUREAU THE TOOL TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. PLEASE HELP US MAKE THE CURRENT LAWS STRONGER THAN YESTERDAY. BY VOTING I ON THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THIS WE HAVE A SECOND.

FIFTY NINE ZERO NO FIFTEEN IS WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS SOMEONE IS HEARING FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB. TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I WILL KEEP THE PRESENTATION BRIEF BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PRESENTATION ON THIS BILL BECAUSE THE MERITS OF THIS BILL ARE CRITICAL- AB TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS WHO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM. A DRUG OR DEVICE COMPANY TO DISCLOSE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND WRITING TO EACH PATIENT PRIOR TO TREATMENT. THE DISCLOSURE WOULD REQUIRE A LINK. TO THE ALREADY EXISTING FEDERAL OPEN PAYMENTS WEBSITE AND A PATIENT SIGNATURE. OPEN PAYMENTS IS A IS THE EASY TO USE FEDERAL WEBSITE. WHICH LISTS FINANCIAL EXCHANGES BETWEEN DRUG AND DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS GOING BACK TO. TWENTY FOURTEEN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TYPE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S NAME AND YOU CAN SEE IT. IF YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE IF THEY'VE RECEIVED MONEY AND FOR HOW MUCH AND FOR WHAT DURATION INCLUDING EVEN FREE LUNCHES. IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROGRAM IT'S EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AND IT'S TRANSPARENCY. I THINK PROVIDES THE CREDIBILITY NECESSARY. FOR ALL DOCTORS TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WHILE ACCEPTING THESE PAYMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO A CONFLICT OF INTEREST PHYSICIANS FAILING TO AFFIRMATIVELY DISCLOSE POTENTIALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION CAN PUT THAT RELATIONSHIP TO RISK. ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS A WENDY CONNECT WHO UNDERWENT UNDERWENT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOLLOWING A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. SUFFERED GREATLY SHE NEEDED TO HAVE SIX MORE SURGERIES TO UNDO WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE FIRST SURGERY. IT WAS FOUND OUT THAT SHE HAD THE BRCA GENE WHICH MADE HER VULNERABLE FOR BREAST CANCER SO SHE WENT IN TO GET A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. THE DOCTOR THE SURGEON THAT WAS RECOMMENDED TO HER CAME EXTREMELY- RECOMMEND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BUT WHAT HE DID NOT DISCLOSE TO HER IS THAT HE AS USING A DEVICE. A PRODUCT THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN FDA APPROVED. IT'S FINE THAT IT WAS AN FDA APPROVED HE COULD STILL USE IT BUT HE NEEDED TO LET HER KNOW THAT HE IS GOING TO BE UTILIZING- A PROCEDURE AND THE PRODUCT. THAT HAS NOT BEEN FDA APPROVED AND THAT IT COULD CAUSE SEVERE CHALLENGES. HE DID NOT. WENT AHEAD AND UTILIZE THAT ON HER. SHE SUFFERED SO GREATLY THAT SHE HAD HAD SHE HAD TO HAVE SIX MORE SURGERIES IN ORDER TO UNDO. WHAT HAD BEEN DONE THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED WITH WITH ONE SURGERY. SHE BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP TO ME SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT- OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST LITERALLY TWO AND A HALF YEARS. IN ORDER TO BRING IT. TO THIS POINT TODAY- WITH ME. I AM JOINED BY DR CHARLES ROSEN FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR MEDICAL ETHICS OF WHO IS ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO AUTHORED THE OPEN RECORDS FEDERAL. RECCA OPEN RECORDS PROGRAM AS WELL AS MY CONSTITUENTS WENDY CONNECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THERE ARE TWO I WILL LIMIT TESTIMONY FOR UP TO TWO MINUTES PER INDIVIDUAL PLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WELCOME HELLO. OKAY HI MY NAME TWENTY CONNECT AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY NO I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THERE AND GET THE HELL MY BACKGROUND THOUGHT GET THAT PART. BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT A SIMPLE DISCLOSURE OF MY DOCTOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST WOULD HAVE BEEN POWERED MY HUSBAND WHO IS A PHYSICIAN I NEED TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. HAVING KNOWN ABOUT THESE FINANCIAL CONFLICT I WOULD NEVER HAVE CONSENTED TO THE SURGERY AND SUBSEQUENTLY COULD HAVE AVOIDED. SEVERE COMPLICATIONS REQUIRING. THE SEVERAL UP. AND THE CAN PAIN IN THE- THAT EXIST. I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS AN INFORMED CONSUMER. BUT MY SITUATION MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WITHOUT KNOWING ABOUT YOUR DOCTORS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY PATIENT. HAVE FULLY INFORMED CONSENT. AS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN A VERY POINTED OUT THE TYPE CAN ALSO BE A POSITIVE BUT IT'S THE PATIENTS RIGHT NOW DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL HIGH IS LEGALLY REQUIRED WHEN A DOCTOR SENT YOU TO A FACILITY THEY HAVE A FINANCIALINTEREST THE PATIENT MUST SIGN A DOCUMENT BUT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE IS NOT REQUIRED WHEN THEY PRESCRIBE A DRUG FOR YOU DOING JACK OR DEVICE TO IMPLANT INSIDE YEAH. THAT'S THE THING PREPOSTEROUS THINK ABOUT OPIOIDS THE DRUG COMPANIES INCENTIVIZED DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE THE TICKETING KILLED THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS AND THE HIGH COST OF PRESCRIBING BRAND NAME DRUGS OVER. THAT HOSTAGE IN THERE IT DOES. FACED WITH THE- A DOCTOR MAKE TWICE. IT'S BEEN A ONLY RIGHT FOR A CASE TO FACT THE SAME TYPE. OF TRANSPARENCY FROM A DOCTOR THAT'S REQUIRED WHEN YOU'RE REALLY CHAIR OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE DEEPLY ABOUT PATIENT PROTECTION PASSING AB ONE TWO SEVEN EIGHT WILL DO JUST THAT IT WILL EMPOWER PATIENTS WITH THE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION THEY HAVE THE RIGHT NOW LIFE DEPENDS ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PRIMARY WITNESS PLEASE. MY NAME IS CHARLES ROSEN I'M A PROFESSOR OF ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY AT THE UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN FOR THIRTY YEARS AS WELL AS PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR MEDICAL ETHICS. IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT A CERTAIN MEDICAL DEVICE PASSED THE FDA IN AMERICORPS STUDYING WAS TAKEN OFF THE MARKET TWO YEARS LATER AFTER MANY PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN MY OPINION. I LATER FOUND OUT THAT MANY OF THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY AND SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH ENDORSING THE PRODUCT HAD BEST FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE SUCCESS WHEN THIS WAS DONE ON THE PATIENTS AND DOCTORS. IN AFRICA LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY ENDED UP SPEAKING WITH SENATORS CALL AND GRASSLEY RESPONDED TO THIS NEED BY PROBING THE- LEGISLATION CALLED THE POSITION PAYMENT SUNSHINE ACT WHICH- MISTER NAZARIAN REQUIRED. I WAS ASKED BY THE SENATORS TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS FOR IT WHICH I DID THE ACT. PASSED IN REQUIRES ALL MEDICAL. THE COMPANIES TO RIP TO THE FROM AT THE- TO THERE MONEY OR THE LACK AND HOW MUCH. INDUSTRY RESISTED REVEALING FINANCIAL DETAILS OF SUCH PAYMENTS THE POSITIONS IN RESEARCH OR PRACTICE BECAUSE IT BRINGS OUT FOR ALL TO SEE THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL BIAS IN RESEARCH OR PATIENT CARE MAKE THAT. THIS OFTEN MAKES DOCTORS IMPATIENT PRESIDENT THAT PARTICULAR DEVICE OR DRUG TOLD MORE INDEPENDENT RESEARCH IS DONE. INDUSTRY DOES NOT WANT ANY DELAY OF THIS MAY HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PROFITS FOR THAT PRODUCT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS AB TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT ONLY MAKE PATIENTS AWARE IN WRITING OF THIS DATABASE THEY CAN ACCESS REGARD ANY COMPANY THE DOCTOR HAS THE LIST OF HAVING A FINANCIAL POWER. NOTHING MORE THE DOCTOR DOES NOT HAVE TO GIVE ORAL NOTIFICATION OR AMOUNTS OF COMPANY PAYMENTS INVOLVED. THERE'S NO INCREASE IN DR PAPERWORK OR TIME JUST ANOTHER SIGNATURE PAGE PER PATIENT. PATIENTS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW IF THE DOCTOR HAS AN INDUSTRY TI&lt;c.cyan&gt; HAVE ACCESS THAT IF THEY&lt;/c&gt; WANT AND AS IMPORTANTLY. THIS IS PART OF LEGALLY MANDATED. INFORMED CONSENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT CONCLUDES THE- OPPORTUNITY FOR PRIMARY WITNESSES TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. WHEN I MOVE ON TO THE LINE'S OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SIGNIFY THEIR SUPPORT WITH NAME AND AFFILIATION.
