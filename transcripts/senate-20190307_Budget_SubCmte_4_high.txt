WE ARE CHARGED WITH THE OPERATIONS MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA. AND I HAVE PROVIDED WITH YOU HI I'M JUST SOME BACKUP MATERIAL ON IN THE WHITE FOLDERS AS WELL AS JUST A COPY OF THAT THE SLIDE DECK THAT I'M JUST GONNA RUN THROUGH IS. AS I PROVIDE JUST AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS GAL IS AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SO THIS GAL IS ONE OF THE LARGEST. AND MOST DYNAMIC IT SYSTEMS AT THE STATE HAS EVER DEPLOYED -- IT STARTED OFF AS JUST A BUDGETING REPLACEMENT SYSTEM AND TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND A TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IT WAS BROUGHT IN TO BASICALLY REPLACE THE LEGACY SYSTEMS. OF THE FOR CONTROL AGENCIES THAT ARE MY PARTNERS SO AT THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. THE PROCUREMENT PIECES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JOHN I FINANCE -- AND AGAIN IT WAS THE PURPOSE FOR THIS WAS TO PROVIDE THAT CENTRALIZED A SINGLE SINGLE SYSTEM OR ALL OF THE INFORMATION ARE ALL THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE STATE COULD BE FOUND. SO AND THEN WE PICTURE IT IN IN THE THE TREES YOU CAN SEE THE ROOFS ALL GOING OUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THEN AGAIN WE'RE COMING INTO THIS INDUSTRY THAT IS GOING TO BE A SINGLE SOURCE OF THAT INFORMATION. THE THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEM -- IS WHAT MAKES. THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM IS IS REALLY WHAT MAKES THIS. UNIQUE I AGAIN AS YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A POPULATION OF IN EXCESS OF THIRTY NINE MILLION RESIDENTS. WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND SO OUR STATE GOVERNMENT IS IS OPERATING TO SUPPORT THOSE PEOPLE AND THAT AND THIS ECONOMY. THE SYSTEM TODAY HAS ABOUT 65% OF TOTAL BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES RUN THROUGH OUR SYSTEM THAT TOTALS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED NINETY THREE BILLION DOLLARS -- IN OCTOBER WE BROUGHT ON TO THE TREASURY FUNCTIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER WHICH MEANS THAT WE DO ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS OF BANKING HAPPENS WITHIN THE THE FISCAL SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES THE EIGHT LARGE BANKS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES BUSINESS WITH. I'M OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AS WELL AS THE FIFTY OR SO -- GANG. MAKE A COUNTER -- ARE AT LARGE PROGRAMS THAT THE TREASURER MANAGES AS THE BANK FOR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND VENDORS THAT DO BUSINESS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SELLING GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE. AND THEY UTILIZE -- THE THE FISCAL SYSTEM AND THE PLATFORM THAT PRODUCED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES CALLED CAL E. PROCURE. WE HAVE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND USERS CURRENTLY UTILIZING THE SYSTEM WE WERE ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED TO BE ABOUT A THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND USE OUR SYSTEM. WHERE -- EIGHTEEN I EXPECT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ALL HAVE CLOSER TO TWENTY THOUSAND AND USERS BECAUSE I'M STILL ON BOARDING SOME OF THE USERS FOR THE THE MOST RECENT DEPARTMENTS THAT CAME ON AS WELL AS BY THE TIME WE BRING IN OUR DEFERRED EXEMPTS DEPARTMENT OR THE DEFERRED. DEPARTMENTS -- WE WILL PROBABLY BE CLOSER HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM. AND IF YOU FLIP TO SLIDE. SIX I THIS IS JUST A KIND OF A PICTURE SUMMARIZING SOME OF WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID WE HAVE A WERE INTENDED TO COME ON TO THE SYSTEM -- ARE DEPLOYED AGAIN WE HAVE ABOUT NINE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN -- ACCOUNTING AN ERP SYSTEM A MODERN ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. THAT HAS NOT BEEN PASSED ITS USEFUL LIFE AT THIS POINT BUT WHEN WE GET WHEN THEY GET TO THAT POINT THEY WILL BE COMING ON TO THE FISCAL SYSTEM. WE NOW ANY THAT WE SET OUT TO DEPLOY IS IN -- IS IN THE SYSTEM IN THE DEPARTMENTS AND CONTROL AGENCIES ARE UTILIZING THAT FUNCTIONALITY WE HAVE ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED REQUIREMENTS LAUGHED AND THOSE PERTAIN TO THE THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S CASH BOOK OF RECORD COMING OVER WE'VE ALREADY MOVED. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OTHER PIECES OF THAT THE THE CONTROLLER SYSTEM WE JUST RECENTLY MOVED OVER WARRANTS AND THEY'RE RUNNING IN PARALLEL SYSTEM WHICH YOUR STAFF. RODE UP ABOUT THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION ON HOW WE'RE RUNNING SOME OF THE THE CONTROL FUNCTIONS THROUGH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. IN PARALLEL. FOR I LIMITED TIME. SO WE HAVE THAT AS WELL AS THE BUILDING OUT OF THE AT THE KAFFIR WHICH IS THE I ALWAYS GET. THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTING. IN. REPORT THANK YOU. THAT THE CONTROLLER - DOES PRODUCE THROUGH THROUGH THE SYSTEM. THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES JUST -- ILLUSTRATE THE IF SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED INTO THE FISCAL SYSTEM REPLACING. THESE ARE THE KEY LEGACY SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPLACED AND THAT WAS SLIDE. SEVEN AND THEN ON SLIDE EIGHT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN OUR LEGISLATIVE REPORT AND IT. MEASURES US AGAINST THE LEGISLATIVE OBJECTIVES SET FORTH IN STATUTE. AND WE HAVE MET THOSE LEGISLATIVE EXIT -- OBJECTIVES AND WE'RE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING THE FINAL. TO SELL ON THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT. ON PAGES TEN AND ELEVEN ON PAGE TEN THE TRANSPARENCY WEBSITE IS SOMETHING THAT WE EXPECTED TO FULLY DEPLOY. IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO DO THAT WE ACTUALLY ISSUED AND PUT OUT THE SITE EARLY AS A PILOT. WE STARTED WITH FOR DEPARTMENTS LAST JULY AND WE'RE NOW AT SIXTY SIX DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY HAVING THEIR EXPENDITURE INFORMATION UP ON THE TRANSPARENCY WEBSITE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENTS THE MINISTRATION. TO REFINE THE TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT ARE UP AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS IN FORMATS THAT. THAT I CAN BE UTILIZED BY ALL SO AGAIN THAT HAS BEEN WE RECEIVED POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON IT THOSE FOLKS IT MORE THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CODES FOR SACRAMENTO AND AND CODES FOR IT -- MEREKA TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS CAN TELL THAT OTHER FOLKS HAVE BEEN ON THE SYSTEM AS WELL. SO THAT IS ON TRACK AND WE WILL BE BRINGING ON THE REMAINING DEPARTMENTS IN -- THAT THIS THIS COMING SUMMER. THEN THE FINAL PIECE OF THE THE FUNCTIONALITY AND THE PROJECT ITSELF IS THE SCO REALLY STATUS. IN S. P. R. SEVEN WE DID BREAK DOWN THE RELEASE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CONTROLLER INTO FIVE MAJOR MILESTONES. AND AGAIN AFTER -- SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AT TRYING. TO TO CUT OVER THE BOOK OF RECORD IN ONE FELL SWOOP -- WE DECIDED COLLECTIVELY AS THE THE FOR PARTNER AGENCIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH SCALE. TO BREAK IT INTO -- SEPARATE BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND ROLL IT ON ALLOWING FOR SOME STABILITY SOME STABILIZATION OF THE SYSTEM AND SOME VALIDATION FRM THE CONTROLLERTO TO VALIDATE THAT THE INFORMATION IN THE SYSTEM. IS MAKING SENSE WITH THEIR WITH THEIR BOOK OF RECORD SO LIKE I SAID WE ARE -- CURRENTLY. SCHEDULED TO RELEASE THE REMAINING PARTS OF MILESTONE THREE AND THEN MILESTONE FOR IN THIS FISCAL YEAR AND AS INDICATED ON SLIDE ELEVEN AND IN SOME OF THE WRITE UPS OF OVERSIGHT ENTITIES WE ARE. CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE TIMELINE IN THE SCHEDULE. FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE KAFFIR FUNCTIONALITY. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. REGARDING THE DELAYS -- WILL THEY REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS. IMAM IN THIS BUDGET YEAR OR IN THE FUTURE AND SECOND -- WILL ANY OF THE DELAYS -- FOR CHALLENGES TO CLOSING OUT -- MONTH OR YEAR AND REPORTS WILL THEY RESULT IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT. WITH REGARD TO OUR FINANCIAL STANDING. SO WITH X. WITH THAT TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION. WE ARE STILL IN THE ANALYSIS PHASES TO WHAT COMPONENTS WE WOULD NEED TO TO MOVE AND HOW MUCH THAT WILL COST. AGAIN THE THE TOTAL PROJECT WAS AT NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WE SEE WE HAVE NOT COMPLETELY EXPENDED THOSE RESOURCES AS OF YET. SO WHATEVER ASKED WE WOULD COME TO THE LEDGE. IF IF THE NINETEEN DIDN'T COVER THOSE TOTAL EXPENDITURE SO IT'S IT'S TOO EARLY TO KNOW AT THIS POINT HOW MUCH -- OR IF WE WOULD BE COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- BUT WE EXPECT AGAIN THE STEERING COMMITTEE IS WORKING ON THIS ENDEAVOR RIGHT NOW AND SO IT IT WILL BE AND NOW. IN A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF MONTHS VERSUS YOU KNOW YEARS WILL WILL KNOW SHORTLY. WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT USING AN AGILE METHODOLOGY OR THE SPRINTS THIS LAST ASIO MILESTONE PIECES WHICH MEANS THAT WE MOVE THINGS FORWARD WHEN WHEN THEY'RE READY TO GO AND WE'VE PUSH THINGS OUT WHEN THEY NEED MORE TIME AGAIN FOCUSING ON THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. GOING OUT SO THAT THE SYSTEM. DOESN'T PRESENT MORE ISSUES. THAN SAUCE NO WE NEED TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION WE'RE PUTTING OUT IN THE SYSTEM IS IS ACCURATE AND SECURE. SO THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION. THEN THE SECOND PIECE WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENTS ARE CLOSING THEIR MINDS [inaudible] THE I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT WE KNOW WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE ON A CREDIT RATING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE IN THE SYSTEM. WE HAD ONLY FIFTEEN THAT ARE OUR HEAD. ESTIMATED STATEMENTS TO THE CONTROLLER AND THAT WILL BE USED IN OUR IN THEIR REPORT. TO THE BOND RATING AGENCIES. THE YOU KNOW THE HISTORY ON WHAT. GOES INTO YOUR BOND RATING AND AND THE STATE'S CREDIT RATING. VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. AND IF AND AGAIN THE TREASURE TO SPEAK TO THIS MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I CAN BUT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD PROVIDED TO US INDICATED THAT. THE MAIN REASONS FOR ANY NEGATIVE MOVEMENT ON THE KAFFIR HAD BEEN BECAUSE OF LATE BUDGETS ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. OR AT SOME SORT OUT WHETHER VOTER PROPOSITIONS THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE WHERE YOU TAKE ADAM IF THERE'S A MAJOR INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT THAT. IS ALLOCATING SPENDING THOSE AT THOSE PERIODS OF TIMES WE'VE SEEN A NEGATIVE IMPACT. OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE THE THE GLOBAL RECESSION THAT WE HAD AND WAS THE LAST TIME THAT THAT THIS WAS IMPACTED. WE HAVE PRODUCED TO ESTIMATED STATEMENTS BEFORE IN THE PAST. THOSE DID NOT RESULT IN NEGATIVE DOWNGRADES BUT AGAIN. THAT'S ALL ANECDOTAL WHAT THE HISTORY AS IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE MOST ACCURATE FINANCIAL RECORDS TO ADD TO THE CITIZENS AS WELL AS TO THOSE THAT ARE INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA BONDS. AND THAT IS WHAT FISKE OUT IS IS REALLY STRIVING TO DO SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THOSE DEPARTMENTS -- WE HAVE RESOURCES THAT ARE ARE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THEM -- INCLUDING THE ON BOARDING OF AS YOU KNOW SOME CONTRA REDIRECTING SOME OF MY CONTRACTOR STAFF TO WORK WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST MATERIAL FOR THE STATE OF ALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEIR BOOKS ARE CLOSING ON TIME. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS FOR THE DEPARTMENTS TO CLOSE. IS. AT EDUCATION AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR UNDERSTANDING THE NEW SYSTEM WE WENT FROM A TRANSACTIONAL I SYSTEM WHICH WAS MOSTLY CAL STARS MISS IT APARTMENTS WERE ON THE CAL STARS TRANSACTIONAL SYSTEM. TO TRUE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM AND SO THERE IS A LEARNING CURVE FOR THE DEPARTMENTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO ENTER. YOUR EXPENDITURES INTO THE PROPER LEDGERS AND YOU REVENUES IN THE PROPER LEDGERS. AND SO THAT IS AN ONGOING EFFORT THAT WE HAVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH IT WITH AGAIN MY FOR PARTNERS. TO EDUCATE THE DEPARTMENTS. AND WE'VE LOOKED AT RECENTLY FROM DOING THEIR OWN BOOKS TO USING THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES CONTRACTED FISCAL SERVICES. TO AGAIN IF THEY'RE TOO SMALL. OR IF THEY HAVE SEPARATION OF DUTIES ISSUES WITHIN A NEW. ROBUST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WE ARE LOOKING TO TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT THEM BESIDES JUST. SAYING HE'S GONNA DO IT FASTER HIS. THAT'S HARD THANK YOU HELLO OFFICE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS BRIAN METZGER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- SO WE LIKE TO ORGANIZE OUR COMMENTS AROUND -- TO GENERAL TOPIC AREAS THE FIRST BEING THE DELAYS IN THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION AND THE SECOND BEING THE ON GOING CHALLENGES FOR THE PROJECT -- THE FIRST IS THAT IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED THAT THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION WILL NOT BE COMPLETED BY JULY -- TWENTY NINETEEN AT BASED ON THE SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT THE MOST RECENT -- ONE WE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION -- THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IS DIRECTING THE FISCAL PROJECT TO SUBMIT WHAT IS CALLED A PROJECT OF THE DOCUMENT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CALLING IT -- TO UPDATE -- THE POTENTIAL COST AND SCHEDULE TO OF THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION AND POTENTIALLY OTHER TOPICS -- THIS WOULD POTENTIALLY BE IN LIEU OF A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT -- BARRING ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND COST OR SCHEDULE -- THIS PROCESS -- IT WOULD REPRESENTS -- AND HAVE THE SAME AUTHORITY AS A SPECIAL REPORT PROCESS -- WHICH WOULD BASICALLY SET A BASELINE BY WHICH THE PROJECT WOULD BE MEASURED AS FAR AS ITS COST AND SCHEDULE GOING FORWARD -- BUT AS WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THIS PROCESS IS CURRENTLY NOT IN STATE I. T. POLICY -- IT IS POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE PROPOSING INTRODUCED BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET CYCLE -- HOWEVER WE REMAIN CONCERNED AND INTRODUCING A NEW PROCESS FOR UPDATING THE COST AND SCHEDULE OF PROJECT THE SIZE OF FISCALE -- WITHOUT IT BEING IN STATE I. T. POLICY -- MAY LIMIT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCESS -- WE WOULD ALSO BASED ON THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ASKED THE DEPARTMENT SORRY THE LEGISLATURE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT -- TO EXPLAIN THE NEW PROCESS -- TO DESCRIBE -- THE AUTHORITY ON WHICH IT RESTS -- TO DESCRIBE. HOW IT WOULD DIFFER FROM THE SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT PROCESS -- AS WELL AS TO YOU CAN MENTION WHAT ROLE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PLAY -- UNDER THIS NEW PROCESS. WE WOULD ALSO WITH REGARDS THE CHALLENGES THAT I THINK THE DIRECTOR -- MENTIONED -- WE CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ON BOARDING OF REMAINING DEPARTMENTS FROM THE JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN RELEASE -- THAT ARE CONTINUING TO USE LEGACY SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO USING FOR SCALE -- THOSE DEPARTMENTS ARE CONTINUING TO ARE -- HAVING TO MATE MAY POTENTIALLY HAVE DELAYS IN CLOSING THEIR MONTH AND AND YEAR END FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO USE THEIR LEGACY SYSTEMS. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE ARE DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE PART OF THE SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT -- THAT ARE ANTICIPATED TO COME ONLINE TO FISCAL -- BUT ARE NOT CAPTURED IN PROJECT COST CURRENTLY -- AND WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT INDIVIDUAL BUDGET REQUESTS TO LATER COME ON FISCAL -- AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE AGAIN KIND OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE DEPARTMENTS ALREADY FACING WITH MONTH AND IN YOUR AND CLOSE -- DID APART AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED FIFTEEN HAD TO SUBMIT ESTIMATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ARE THE DEPARTMENT SAID CAME ONLINE IN JULY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE MUCH LARGER -- AND SO THE RISK OF NOT CLOSING THOSE MONTH AND IN YOUR AND STATEMENTS ON TIME -- COULD BE GREATER FOR THE STATE -- AND SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. LET ME A IN I'M. TURN TEMPORARILY WHERE THE CHAIRS AND IN ANOTHER MEETING. THIS IS A MAYBE PEOPLE TECH KIND OF INNOCUOUS AREA FORCED SUBCOMMITTEE. AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK ABOUT MUCH. BUT I SUBMIT I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS FOR MANY YEARS. EVEN AS A CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD PRISON TERM FOR MANY YEARS WERE. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WAS IMPLEMENTING A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM. IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD RECORD FOR THE STATE THAT PRIDES ITSELF AN ITCH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND LEADERSHIP. IN FACT TO THE CONTRARY IT'S A DISGRACE. ALMOST ALL OF OUR MAJOR TECH PROJECTS HAVE BEEN WAY OVER BUDGET. AND THEY'VE CRASHED [inaudible] VERY FEW. CAN WE EVER SAY. HAVE SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE. AND THAT'S NOT TOLERABLE ANYMORE. AND I WOULD. SET FOR THE RECORD THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE LA ALL RIGHT NOW. ARE ABSOLUTELY. ISSUES THAT I'M GOING TO BE. STAYING ON FOR THE REST OF MY CAREER. BECAUSE AGAIN WE'VE SQUANDERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND I'M I'M NOT COMFORTABLE. WITH IMPLEMENTING A NEW PROCESS. BEFORE WE EVEN UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. AND WE'RE AND I FEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE ADVOCATING EVEN MORE OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY FOR OVERSIGHT. IT STARTED OUT BEING SOMETHING CALLED AND I BLACKED OUT OF KUWAIT OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND I GUESS IT'S NOW DO IT I THINK RIGHT. IT'S THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY YEAH THAT WELL. NOW THIS DEBT. AB CHANGE MANY TIMES THAT BUT THAT IS NOT MY POINT. THE CHANGING AND MAJOR DECISIONS. THE ISSUE RELATED TO MILESTONES IS CRITICAL. AND WE JUST CANNOT. HAVE THAT INTIMATE [inaudible] OVERSIGHT. OF ALL THE TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS AGENCY BY AGENCY. AND THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOW. WITH THE NUMBERS OF AGENCIES COMING ON LINE OR PREPARING. TO UP. WE NEED EVEN BETTER OVERSIGHT THAN MILESTONES. WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT WOULD BE FISCAL DISCIPLINES. IF YOU WILL EVEN PENALTIES. IF CONTRACTORS. ARE NOT. COMPLETING THE JOB OR IF YOUR DEPARTMENT IS NOT. COMPLETING ITS WORK. IN A TIMELY MANNER. THEN ON BUDGET. WHAT SHOULD WE THE LEGISLATURE DUE TO ENSURE THE OVERSIGHT? AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE CONTINUED THE LACE AND OVERRIDES. THERE IS A LOT IN ALL OF THAT. A LOT BUT IT'S IT'S A CRITICAL ERROR IT IT ABSOLUTELY ALIENS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT. THE CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO PUT A STAUNCH THE BLEEDING HERE SO. THIS SYSTEM DOES MANAGE CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF EXPENDITURES THROUGH THE SYSTEM. IT DOES CURRENTLY MANAGE THE TWO TRILLION DOLLARS IN BANKING. THE DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING ABLE. TO TO PAY THEIR BILLS TO FUNCTION AND TO DO THEIR WORK AND THAT IS ALWAYS WHAT IS KEY FOR US AS WELL AS MY FOR PARTNERS. SO IF YOU DEPARTMENT IS COMING ACROSS AN ISSUE WE WORK SPECIFICALLY WITH THEM. TO MAKE SURE THAT -- CRITICAL LIKE FIRE SAFETY ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENTS DEAL WITH THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET THOSE PAYMENTS AND EXPENDITURES. OUT THE DOOR -- THAT IS THE WE CANNOT STOP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM CONSERVING THE PEOPLE THE I'M WITH RESPECT TO THE TO THE BUDGET THE BUDGET AND SCOPE OF THE OF THIS PROJECT HAS SWUNG SIGNIFICANTLY. WE STARTED OFF AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT WHEN WE WERE JUST THE BUDGETING SYSTEM SO THAT WAS THE FIRST. ESTIMATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD WE WENT UP AS HIGH AS ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY AT NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOSE CHANGES HAPPEN BECAUSE WE'VE INCREASED OR DECREASED SCOPE OVER OVER THE YEARS. AND PART OF THAT HAS OCCURRED BECAUSE IT IS A LONG PROJECT SO THINGS THAT WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE GOING TO NEED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND A CERTAIN WAY OF DOING IT. AREN'T NECESSARILY. WHAT WE NEEDED IN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN WE STARTED DEPLOYING? SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THROUGH THE THE AMENDMENT PROCESS THROUGH THE SPR PROCESSOR OR THROUGH THE UPDATE PROCESS THAT THE CITY IS PROPOSING. THAT. WE GO IN AND AND WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT. WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ON STILL MAKE SENSE AND IF IT DOESN'T THEN WE TAKE THAT OUT AND WE REMOVE IT FROM THE SCOUT? AND SO THAT HAS BEEN THE HISTORY ON THIS PROJECT SO. IT. IT HAS HAD TO COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL TIMES ASKING -- FOR CHANGES TO ITS SCOPE AND SCHEDULE BUT AGAIN IT IS TO PRODUCE THAT PRODUCT THAT WILL PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION AND THAT TRANSPARENCY THAT THE DEPARTMENT -- HAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS THAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN UTILIZE TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS. SO. I WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU KNOW HAVING FOUR THOUSAND OF THE FORTY TWO HUNDRED REQUIREMENTS ALREADY IN PLACE. IS IS. REALLY AN INDICATION THAT THE PROJECT IS SUCCESSFUL WHAT. IT MAKES IT MORE CHALLENGING AND MORE DIFFICULT IS AN IMPLEMENTATION IN THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT PIECE. THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT KEYS. IS THE HARDEST PART -- WE WE CHANGE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY CALIFORNIA DOES BUSINESS. AND THAT MEANS THAT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE HAD. TO DO THEIR JOBS DIFFERENTLY. I THERE ARE THINGS THAT WERE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE REQUIREMENTS AND POLICY. AS WELL AS REGULATION THAT THE DEPARTMENTS WERE EXPECTED TO COMPLY WITH. THAT FISCAL SYSTEM. EIGHT IF YOU WERE UNAWARE OF IT YOU'RE NEW TO THE STATE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS HURDLE OR THAT HURDLE. YOU CANNOT PROCEED IN THE SYSTEM UNTIL YOU'VE FULLY COMPLIED WITH THE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT. INTO THE SYSTEM SO IT DOES PROVIDE. A MORE. ACCURATE. ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IT IS HARDER FOR DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE OF THAT THINGS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RECONCILE TWO MONTHS. DO THEIR BUDGETS AND SO IT IS MORE THAN JUST THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OF THE TECHNOLOGY IT'S WHAT THAT. TECHNOLOGY MEANS TO THE IT TO THEIR DAY TO DAY WORK AND AGAIN I I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENTS ARE BEING REQUIRED TO PUT INTO THE SYSTEM. IS MORE DETAILED. THEREFORE LEADING TO MORE TRANSPARENCY BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT YOU DO HAVE THAT LEARNING CURVE ON AND HOW YOU YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY A HUGE UNDERTAKING WE ARE THE LARGEST FINANCIAL ERP SYSTEM -- IN THE POT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND I WOULD ARGUE IN IN THE WORLD GIVEN WHERE MUCH LARGER THAN ANY -- IS SO IT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WHILE WE CAN LOOK TO OTHER STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES AND AND HOW THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED IT WE ARE UNIQUELY CALIFORNIAN AND WE HAVE. OUR LAWS AND OUR STRUCTURES THAT HAVE ADDED TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS IMPLEMENTATION AND FOR THE DEPARTMENTS. SO WELL I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT IT ISN'T A DIFFICULT FOR THE DEPARTMENTS I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THIS. EFFORT HAS BEEN. THOUGHTFUL METHODICAL IT HAS BEEN SLOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY. TODAY THAT IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW OUT OBSOLETE BY THE TIME FOR FULLY UTILIZING. ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS ARE UTILIZING THE FISCAL SYSTEM THERE ARE VERY FEW THERE'S EIGHTEEN BETTER CURVE -- CALENDARS AT THIS -- CALENDARS AT CAL STARS SORRY -- THEY THE LEGACY ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SOME OF THAT IS FOR THE FEDERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'RE STILL CAN WE STILL WORK ON THERE'S ABOUT. SIX OR EIGHT OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS. AND MOST OF THE OTHERS THAT ARE UTILIZING BOTH SYSTEMS IT'S TO DO SOME VALIDATION OF SOME OF THE LAST. RELEASE ENHANCEMENT SO WE'VE DONE SOME MOST OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS WILL BE COMING OFF OF THEIR GROUPS ARE EXPECTED TO COME OFF OF CAL STARS. AT THE END OF MARCH SO IT'S IF THEY'RE NOT DOING TO COMPLETE. DUPLICATE SYSTEMS IT'S REALLY SOME OF THEM ARE USING CAL START TO DO SOME OF THE REPORTING THAT THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM. SUMMER DOING I USING IT -- FOR PAYMENT TO FOREIGN VENDORS BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT WITH OUR PARTNERS -- BUT FOR THE FOR THE BULK OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN THE BULK OF THE DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING SPENT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE. FOREIGN TRACKED WITHIN OUR SYSTEM WELL YOU TRACKING BUT THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE CONTINUED DELAYS. I WANT TO GET THAT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE CAN THEN EFFECT CONSEQUENCES. THAT THERE SOME KIND OF PENALTY. TO THE CONTRACTOR. OR TO THE DEPARTMENTS THEY THEY CAN'T JUST KEEP DOING THIS AND I'M NOT COMFORTABLE BUT YOU'VE GOT ANY MECHANISMS IN THERE. TO MAKE THEM REALLY ACCOUNTABLE MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE TRANSPARENT THAT IS STILL ACTIVITIES THIS PROCESS IS THAT YOU'RE. DEALING WITH NOW IS GOING TO EVEN GIVE US A LET LESSER ABILITY TO OVERSEE AND IMPLEMENT CONSEQUENCES WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE CONTINUED FAILURES. SO THERE ARE CONTRACT CONTRACTUAL CONSEQUENCES FOR EXTENSION OKAY DO YOU EVER EMPLOYED THE YES WE HAVE AND I CAN PHONE A FRIEND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH THAT. JUST YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO AS IT COSTS THESE BUSINESSES SUBSTANTIAL MONEY I HOPE AT I WOULD IMAGINE SO. ON ABOUT THE STATE AGENCIES AND WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE AGENCIES ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE CONTROL THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT OR THE UTILIZATION OF THE PRODUCT. SO WITH EITHER ONE HAVE WORKED WITH CAGE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT WE DID BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE MILESTONES AND LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE DID TILE HI THE MILESTONES. TO SUM APPROPRIATION DOLLARS FOR FOR THE SO THAT MECHANISM. IS IN PLACE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO SUCCESSFULLY DELIVER ON THE BUT I BELIEVE WILL BE AT THE THE FOUR MILESTONES WE HAVE A GOOD WAY AT THE FIFTH MILESTONE. COMPLETED BUT BECAUSE OF RESOURCES CONSTRAINTS OR ISSUES THAT COME UP ON A PROJECT THIS COMPLEX AS WE'RE TRYING TO REPRODUCE. INFORMATION IN THE LEGACY SYSTEM THAT IS UTILIZED REDUCE THE KAFFIR. WE HAVE COME UP WITH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE INITIALLY KNOWN RECOGNIZED AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN PLACE SO INSTEAD OF JUST AGAIN BUILDING. WHAT WE WERE BUDGETED AND WHAT WE HAD SCOPED? WE ARE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE SCOPE RIGHT TO PRODUCE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE NEED AND NOT JUST. YOU KNOW MAKING MAKING THE DATES SO THAT IS HOW YOU KNOW THE CONTROL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN -- MOST RECENTLY BEEN BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE FUNCTIONALITY. WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENTS WE ARE. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE WE HAVE PROVIDED AND WHAT WE CALL USER SUPPORT LABS WEEK THEY BRING IN THEIR TRANSACTIONS INTO MY DEPARTMENT. THEY SIT WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS EITHER FROM MY DEPARTMENT WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCES STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AS NEEDED DEPENDING ON THAT ISSUE. AND WE HELP THEM WORK THROUGH WHAT THERE'S DON I'M MORE. LABS IN THE WITH THIS FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR THAN WE DID IN ALL OF LAST YEAR. AND WE HAVE. WE DON'T EXPECT TO SLOW DOWN ON THAT SO WE'RE PROVIDING MORE HANDS ON KEYS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENTS. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM WE ALSO HAVE A SIGNED -- WHAT WE HAD BEEN DOING IS HAVING? WHAT IT COLUMN READY MISS CORNERS TO PART WITH TO HELP DEPARTMENTS COME ON TO THE SYSTEM WE HAVE REPURPOSE THOSE READING THIS COORDINATORS? TO BE KIND OF THE THE DEPARTMENTAL LIAISONS AND HAD LEARNT WHAT ARE YOUR ISSUES BEFORE THEY KNOW THE ISSUES SOMETIMES WE CAN SPOT THE ISSUES. AND HELP THEM HEY I I REALIZE YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF TICKETS AND THEY ARE I'M GONNA DO A SPECIAL LAB JUST FOR YOU BECAUSE YOUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE -- TRANSACTIONS AREN'T. WHAT THEY SHOULD BE IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT IS SOMETHING NEW THAT WE ARE DOING NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHIFT RESOURCES FROM? ONBOARDING DEPARTMENTS TO ACTUALLY SUPPORTING THEM AND SO WE ARE HOPING TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR THE DEPARTMENTS IN THAT REGARD -- AND THEN AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT FISCALE DOESN'T HOLD ANY -- ANY STICKS WERE JUST WE CAN PROVIDE CARE TO MAKE A PROVIDE ASSISTANCE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT PORTION THE CONTRACTS AND WE DEPEND ON THE PART OF THE GENERAL SERVICES. NOTE WE MANAGE OUR CONTRACT OKAY. THAT SO YOU WERE THE ONE THAT CAN PENALIZES A CONTRACTOR WHO DOES NOT MEET THE MILESTONES ARE COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT YES AND I DON'T KNOW IF. JENNY SAID THAT THIS HAPPENED A ONCE OR ONCE OR TWICE ARTS HAPPEN SOMETIME CORRECT CAN I ASK -- PLANNING ON YOUR JUST COME ON UP. JUST TO PROVIDE THE THE BACKGROUND ABOUT HOW OFTEN ITS USE THAT THE SIZE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS THE H. A HIGH AND CHIEF DEPUTY AFTER FOR THE BOND FOR SCALE. ALSO THE PROGRESS OF A PREDATOR FISCAL. SO WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH ACCENTURE -- AND THERE. A DIFFERENT MECHANISMS IN THE CONTRACT TO HOLD ACCENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SERVICE LEVELS. AND WE HAVE USED THAT IN THE PAST SO -- IN A COUNTRY THAT SERVICE LEVELS FOR RESOLUTION OF TICKETS. AND TIME YEARS LOOSEN UP SYSTEM -- ISSUES IN THE SYSTEM. AND ON A PERIODIC BASIS WHERE IT'S CENTER HAS MISSED. THE SERVICE LEVELS HI THERE WE HAVE GIVEN US CREDIT OVER THE YEARS. I DON'T HAVE THE THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THE CREDITS WE RECEIVE FROM EXTENSION. OF YOU HAVE HAD. SEVERAL OF THOSE INSTANCES WHERE. THEY HAVE MEANT MISSED THE MARK ON THE SERVICE THAT WAS IN PENALTIES [inaudible] WELL THAT. I'M STILL NOT. OVERLY CONFIDENT OF WHERE WE'RE HEADED OKAY. AT AND MADAM CHAIR MIKE THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT I MAKE IS CALIFORNIA OVER DECADES IS SQUANDERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE NOT WORKED BEEN OVER BUDGET. ALWAYS DELAYED ALWAYS DELAYED AND DO OUR DAUGHTER WHAT WHATEVER WE'VE CALLED IT OVER THE YEARS. AS SUPPOSED TO BEEN THE AGENCY TO AFFECT CHANGE AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT TO MY OPINION SIGNIFICANTLY YET. AND WE HAVE TO GET MAKE SURE OF THAT AS WE PROCEED AND I'M AWARE OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. LANGUAGE. CERTAINLY IS A MEMBER THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND VICE CHAIR I'VE BEEN A PART OF THAT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO MORE SO I'M SUGGESTING THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE HAVE TO BE VERY FASTIDIOUS IN? AS WE PROCEED TO AUTHORIZE BUDGETS. FOR THIS AGENCY. AND THE DEPARTMENTS THERE IT. THAT WE HAVE TO EFFECT A DIRECT OVERSIGHT. IN OUR ABILITY TO PULL IN THE RANGE. PERIODICALLY SO -- WE CAN'T WAIT AROUND AND DO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND THEN STE FULL OF THE YEAR WE COME BACK TO BUDGET COMMITTEE AND WELL HOW YOU DOING. WE CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG. THAT IN AND NOT BE IN PERSONAL THERE'S MANY GOOD PEOPLE IN YOUR AGENCY THAT I DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL. BUT IT'S JUST BEEN A LONG TIME. HEMORRHAGE AND WE NEED TO STOP THE BLEEDING [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER NEAR -- FIFTY THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL. I'M SORRY JUST A FEW QUESTIONS YES. JUST JUST COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE -- FIRST OF ALL I THINK IS CENTER NIELSEN JUST ILLUSTRATED. YOU HAVE A TOUGH JOB SO. SO MS IS MISS BARCELONA IN THE NEEDLE. IS SOLD ON DISC JUST A FEW QUESTIONS WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL BUDGET FOR THIS PROJECT. IT WAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND IT ONLY REPLACE THE BUDGETING SYSTEM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT? THE COMPLEXITY IT WAS A ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG -- FOR WHEN WE BROUGHT IN THE FOR CONTROLLING THERE'S A START AT ONE FORTY AND YOU SAID IT WAS IT NINE EIGHTEEN IS THAT TODAY. CORRECT BUT IT'S GOING TO GO TO ONE POINT SIX NO IT WAS AT ONE POINT SAY I IN THE MIDDLE IT WENT UP AND THEN. SO IT'S AT NINE EIGHT THAT'S OF PROJECTED COST TO COMPLETION. CORRECT AND ACCENTURE IS THE PRIME YES IN OF THE BEEN THE PRIME SINCE THE BEGINNING YES I HAVE. BEEN ON IN TWENTY TWELVE AND NOT NOT FOR TODAY BUT FOR THE FUTURE PERHAPS OF IF YOU COULD LET US KNOW. WHAT CHANGES EXPANDED THE SCOPE ANOTHER WORDS US FOR CERTAIN SHE WHEN I SAY YOU I I REALIZE THIS? WAS LONG BEFORE YOU WERE PERCENT CHARGE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN CHANGES THAT THAT WE ASK FOR WE MEAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT EXPANDED THE SCOPE YOU CAN EXPECT THE CONTRACTOR. TO BASICALLY SUCK THAT UP. THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN CHANGES THAT WE THOUGHT NO THERE PROBABLY WITHIN THE SCOPEIS THAT RIGHT. OKAY SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD BREAK THAT DOWN FOR US FOR FUTURE HEARING JUST WHAT WE THINK WAS WITHIN WITHOUT. IN TERMS OF PENALTIES CENTER NIELSEN'S POINT WHAT PENALTIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. IN OTHER WORDS YOU'VE CUT THEM BACK SOME PLACES IF YOU HAVE IF YOU COULD JUST LET US KNOW THAT -- YOU SAID IT'S AT 98% FUNCTIONALITY RIGHT NOW IS THAT RIGHT OKAY SO WE HAVE FOUR THOUSAND OF I BELIEVE FORTY TWO HUNDRED REQUIREMENTS -- DEVELOPING DEPLOYED BUILT TESTED DEPLOYED. IN THERE WAS A PROJECT OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROJECT ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT PROJECT. OKAY THAT WAS THE CONTROLLERS PAYROLL PROJECT RIGHT IF YOU ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PROJECT AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE NOT SO WHAT THEY WERE ARMED. BOTH PROJECTS WERE STARTED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME TIME AND THEY WERE ENVISIONED TO RUN IN PARALLEL AN INTERFACE TOGETHER AT AT SOME POINT -- WE ARE INTERFACING TO SOME OF THE OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. AND WE HAD TO CUSTOMIZE A COUPLE OF PIECES IN OUR SYSTEM -- UNTIL WE HAVE. THE LONGER TERM SOLUTION -- FROM WHATEVER PAYROLL SYSTEM WE ULTIMATELY SO WHEN WILL THAT HAPPEN. YOU'D HAVE TO ASK THE CONTROLLER SORRY. BUT IT AIN'T FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE SAID IS GOING TO BE. IN -- OPERABILITY IS THAT RIGHT IT'S ALL RIGHT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE CREE LEGACY SYSTEM WE CURRENTLY -- HAVE INFORMATION THAT COMES FROM THEIR LEGACY SYSTEM CORRECT BUT BUT SOME DAY. I UNDERSTAND LEGACY SYSTEMS BASED ON KOBOL AND EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM THAT UNDERSTANDS WHAT COBLE IS RAISE THEIR HAND. ROLL OVER. FIFTY MAYBE SIXTY ANYWAY THAT THAT OPERATES ON THE COLD BALL SYSTEM RIGHT [inaudible] SO. I THINK IT DOES IN ANY EVENT AT ANY OF IT SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF OUT OF DATE. ROM. IN ANY SENSE OF WHEN THAT SYSTEM WILL BE INTEROPERABLE WITH YOUR SYSTEM. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY'RE IN -- EARLY PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT -- TO PLAN THAT I BELIEVE I HAVE FOLKS HERE FROM THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THAT WOULD BE BETTER ABLE. TO SPEAKER -- TO THE STATUS OF THE I THINK RECALLING BUT IT'S CALLED SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH. WE'LL WE'LL LEAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER DAY -- OKAY. I THINK TO CENTER NIELSEN'S POINT THAT WE WILL NEED A PERHAPS A DEEPER DIVE -- ON THIS AND LASTLY AGAIN. YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHIES SO. OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR -- YES. JUST THE PHENOMENA THAT I BELIEVE. KIND OF INSTITUTIONALIZED. THEN IT'S THE PRODUCT TO THE GREAT TO LIKE NICK TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. BUT I FEAR THAT. SOME OF THESE PROJECTS OVER THE DECADES. EITHER BY THE PROVIDER OF OR MAYBE BY THE AGENCIES. WE HAVE HAD NEW TECHNOLOGY. KIND OF THE CHARMING MEETING. TEMPTING US. AND SO WE GET DOWN THE TRACK ON SOMETHING WITH CONTRACTED FOR NOW THAT'S ALL OLD. AND NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING NEW. THE NEWEST RATE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE IN THIS AREA WHAT NO NO WE HAVE TO THROW THAT ALL AWAY. AND NOW WE HAVE. EMPLOY THE NEW. SO I WANT US TO BE AWARE OF THAT NOW THERE'S NEW PROCESS CAN YOU. REALLY LAID OUT VERY SPECIFICALLY HOW THAT'S GONNA LOOK BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED LA -- HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT. SENATOR I BELIEVE THAT THAT QUESTION IS MORE -- IT IS BETTER ANSWERED BY THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AS THE RECEIPT AS THE RECEIVER OF THE REQUIREMENT WE WILL PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WITH WHATEVER INFORMATION THEY ARE. THEY'RE ASKING US. TO CONTINUE ON THE PROJECT IN THEIR ROLE AS YOU KNOW OUR OVERSIGHT AND EIGHTY OR ONE OF OUR OVERSIGHT ENTITIES. THE MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT AND AGAIN I DO KNOW THAT CD T. IS HERE AS WELL AND CAN SPEAK TO THIS MORE THOROUGHLY BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT BECAUSE WE ARE USING AN AGILE IMPLEMENTATION. THAT. OUT WE ARE NOT TO THE PROJECT THAT DON IT'S REALLY THE TIMING OF THAT THE LAST. NO 2% OR SO BUT AGAIN. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THAT DOCUMENT WILL WILL LOOK LIKE AT THIS POINT -- WE'RE STILL. EVALUATING KIND OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WE NEED TO GO INTO WHETHER THAT COMPONENT WE AGAIN BUT I DO BELIEVE CITY TEAM WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER THEM I HOPE SO BECAUSE I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WAY BEFORE THE BUDGET JUST FINALIZE THIS YEAR.

MY COLLEAGUE IS FROM L. L. -- I JUST WANTED TO GIVE SOME BACKGROUND AS TO WHY WE ARE. INTRODUCING THIS TRAILER BILL ON THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IRS HAVE INCREASED THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT -- MUNICIPAL ISSUANCES ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY FOR TAX EXEMPT FINANCING'S. GS MARCH THE GOAL THAT'S SHORTHAND FOR THE GOLDEN AND SINGS ARE CONSIDERED AN ISSUE ONCE OF MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BY THE STATE. AND SUCH AS FINANCING SADDAM HAVE UNINTENDED EFFECTS ON THE STATE'S OTHER FINANCING PROGRAMS ABSENT PROPER COORDINATION -- SO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CURRENT STATUTE GOVERNING THE GS SMART PROGRAM WILL ENSURE INCREASED COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN GS SMART AND OTHER MAJOR STATE FINANCING PROGRAMS. INCLUDING THOSE MANAGED BY THE S. TEO AND THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD -- TOO COMPLICATED STE THE TRAILER BILL ADDS LANGUAGE TO REQUIRED YES AND A TO OBTAIN. TREASURES OFFICE AND FINANCE APPROVAL FOR TERMS AND CONDITIONS USED THE GS MARK PROGRAM. M. TO AVOID INCONSISTENCIES WITH OTHER STATE FINANCING -- DESERVE BETTER ENSURE THAT STATE SPEAKS TO THE MARKET AND ONE CONSIST. I IT ALSO REQUIRES DDS TO PROVIDE NOTICED OF EACH TRANSACTION TO FINANCING THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE OF THAT THE G. SMART FINANCINGCAN BE COORDINATED WITH OTHER STATE FINANCINGS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE IRIS TIMING REQUIREMENTS FOR STATE EXIT EXCUSE ME PROTECT STATE TAX EXEMPT. ISSUANCES ARE MET. ALSO -- AS LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE GS MARK PROGRAM TO USE LAW FIRMS THAT ARE PULLED FROM A LIST OF BOND COUNSEL FIRMS. THEIR PRE QUALIFIED FOR THE OF BY FAMILIARITY WITH STATE -- ON TAX EXEMPT FINANCING'S AND ADDS CAN CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS TO CONFORM TO CURRENT PRACTICE OF OTHER STATE MUNICIPAL ISSUE RESEARCH ISSUERS ARE -- I'D ALSO NOTE THAT WE WERE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE TREASURES OFFICE ON THIS ITEM AND THEY ARE -- IN CONCURRENCE WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS AND ONE LAST NOTE IS THAT THE AMENDMENTS -- DO NOT PRECLUDE -- DS WILL STILL BE THE IMPLEMENTING -- ENTITY FOR THIS PROGRAM WITHOUT A BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] SIR NIELSEN [inaudible] NOW. NOW TO START YOUR YEARS SIMPLY ASKING PLACE HOLDER LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING -- IT'S AMENDMENT TO CURRENT STATUTES AMENDMENT TO GIVE CARS STATUTES [inaudible] OKAY WELL. I'M BEING A LITTLE NIT PICKY BUT NOT. NOW WE ARE DOING SO MUCH MORE. UNCONSCIONABLE A IN TRAILER BILLS. TRAILER BILL HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF THE BUDGET. IN OVER YEARS. THAT HAS BEEN VERY LOOSELY INTERPRETED. WHERE BY NOW WE'RE DOING MAJOR POLICY CHANGES I DO NOT SUGGEST JUSTICES MAY BE A MAJOR POLICY CHANGE THAT WE'RE DOING MAJOR POLICY CHANGES IN BUDGET? TRAILER BILL. THERE ARE NO POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS WE HAD ONE HUGE ISSUE JUST LAST YEAR THE ONLY HEARING WAS HELD AND UP. FOR AND THERE WERE FOUR MEMBERS SITTING THERE. AT THE TIME. THAT'S VERY INADEQUATE PARTICIPATION SO I WOULD HOPE FOR SOMETHING LITTLE STRONGER THAN. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND SOMETHING THAT WOULD. CONSTITUTE A BILL IN ITSELF WHERE IT WAS EXAMINED AND THEN THE POLICY COMMITTEE. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS TOWARD THE RIGHT END. FINANCE WOULD HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT AND THEREFORE I WOULD HOPE THE LEGISLATURE WITH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS -- THE COMMENT [inaudible] ANYBODY [inaudible] NO. OKAY -- I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION -- IS THIS FINANCING PROGRAM HAVE ANY A MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT -- THE DEPARTMENTS ARE PRIORITIZING THE PROCUREMENT OF OF RESPONSIBLE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS IS THE SENATOR THE IT AT THIS TIME THE FINANCING PROGRAM DOES NOT THE FINANCING PROGRAMS A MECHANISM -- FOR DEPARTMENTS TO PAY FOR HE PURCHASED IT WOULD BE THE CONTRACTING PROCESS IN WHICH THOSE PROVISIONS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN WHICH IS A SEPARATE PART OF THE THE PURCHASING PROCESS [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- NO MORE QUESTIONS -- THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO ADOPT A PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH. TIAS SMART PROGRAM AND OTHER STATE FINANCES AND STRENGTHEN THE COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER STATE FINANCING PROGRAMS FOR YOUR MOTION [inaudible] LIMON OKAY [inaudible] WE THE ROLL CALL YES SENATOR DRAWS THEM YES. SENATOR NELSON NO. SENATOR ON FOR OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT ISSUE THANK YOU ISSUE A IS REQUESTING I TRAVEL PROGRAM I WILL OF OUR COLLEAGUE -- FRIEND JAMES AND JOIN US IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ENERGY TO SEE SUPPORT PROGRAM WHO OVERSEES THE TRAVEL PROGRAM -- JUST BY WAY OF OF BRIEF INTRODUCTION THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INCREASED ENOUGH ALREADY -- TO THE SERVICE REVOLVING FUND IN TGS WHICH ADMINISTERS THIS PROGRAM -- FOR OF APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE PURPOSE OF THE INCREASE IS IS TO ESSENTIALLY PHILIP PROMISE THAT WE MADE TO DEPARTMENTS IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE CREATED THE PROGRAM. SO WE UPGRADED STATEWIDE TRAVEL PROGRAM SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE IDEAS THAT WE WOULD COMBINED ALL PURCHASING POWER OF THE STATE AND ALSO HAVE A SINGLE PLACE FOR ALL TATE TRAVEL TO TO TAKE PLACE THROUGH. MAKING EASIER THERE FOR BOTH USERS OF TRAVEL -- TO BOOK THE TRAVEL AND ALSO MAKING MORE EFFICIENT FOR THE STATE TO MANAGE ACCOUNT FOR THAT TRAVEL. THAT GOT COLLABORATION WE ACTUALLY RECEIVING REVENUE IN THE FORM OF INCENTIVES FROM OUR TRAVEL PARTNERS IS AND WERE ABLE TO PASS ALONG THE SAVINGS TO STATE DEPARTMENTS. WHO ARE CURRENTLY PAYING BOOKING FEES? THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU BEFORE YOU FOR THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WOULD GO TO OFFSET BOOKING FEES -- FOR HOTELS AND RENTAL CARS WHICH I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT POINT IN THIS DISCUSSION SO WE HAVE AT THIS POINT JOHN SERVICES GENERATE ENOUGH REVENUE TO OFFSET THE FIVE DOLLAR BOOKING FEE THAT DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY PAY. FOR HOTEL AND RENTAL CAR SO WE'RE BASICALLY ASKING FOR AN INCREASE IN THAT ALREADY TO THEN PAY THAT BOOKING FEE ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENTS -- AND WERE YOU DOING THAT WITH MONEY THAT WE'RE RECEIVING FROM THE TRAVEL VENDORS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM WITH THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND LOOK FOR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. YES JUST WAIT. I'M SORRY WILL HAVE A SCAN OF THE LA ISLAND WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE LANGUAGE OR WITH THE PROPOSAL I SHOULD SAY THE QUESTION. IS DOES THIS MEAN THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO REBOOK OURSELF WITH TICKETS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH A TRAVEL AGENCY. OR CELLS PERSONALLY THAT I CAN ACTUALLY DO IT MYSELF. SO I I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE LEGISLATURE'S TRAVEL PRACTICES PER SE -- I THANK YOU ALL FOR FOR THE LEGISLATIVE TRAVEL OFFICE TO BOOK YOUR TICKETS AND YOU CAN. BOOK SOUTHWEST TICKETS THROUGH OUR CONCUR SYSTEM BOTH THROUGH TRAVEL AGENTS AND THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. SO. IT'S THROUGH THE THE ORGANIZED CHURCH. OKAY DOES THAT MEAN I CAN BOOK MY TICKET. DIRECTLY OR DO I STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH. SOME TRAVEL AGENCY. CENTER TO ADD TO POINTS OF THIS THE STATE WIDE HEALTH PROGRAM IS AND IS MANDATORY FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS AS AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM FOR OTHER ENTITIES ITS ACTUALLY USED BY SEVERAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE USES THAT ARE ON TRAVEL TRAILER NADER TO BOOK THEIR TRAVEL TO DO -- SO IT IT'S YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR YOUR TRAVEL IS KIND OF OUTSIDE THE PERSONAL OUT OF OKAY GENERAL BUT A GENERAL STATE PLAY YOU NEED TO RE BOOK A FLIGHT WOULD YOU JUST TRAVEL SYSTEM CORRECT. AWKWARD THAT I CAN'T. WITHOUT INCURRING ANY ADDITIONAL STATE EXPENSE CHANGE MY FLIGHT FROM ONE O'CLOCK FLIGHT TO A THREE O'CLOCK FLIGHT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH. A COUPLE DIFFERENT. ENTITIES BUT OKAY GOT IT COULD QUESTIONS [inaudible] YES SIR. ON THAT POINT IS IN THIS AN AUTOMATIC A INVITATION FOR CONTINUING RAISING THE BOOKING FEES THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE COULD BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT LIMITED ON WHAT YOU'RE GONNA PAY IN THE BOOKING FEE WHATEVER THE BOOKING FEE AS ASKED SO SENATOR ACTUALLY THE THE BOOKING FEES ARE CONTRACTED THEY'RE CONTRACTED THROAT TRAVEL MANAGEMENT SERVICE PROVIDER IN ITS COMPETITIVE. SO ACTUALLY IF ANYTHING GOOD THE MORE VOLUME WE BRING TO THE PROGRAM THE THE LOWER THE FEET SOMETHING LIKE A ONE TIME. COULD HOLD -- MOVE ON TO I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS READ LIKE TO HEAR ON PUBLIC COMMENT. FIRST TURN. GOOD MORNING AYE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS RENE BAYARDO SO YOU CALIFORNIA I WOULD JUST START BY SAYING I HAVE THE SAME CONCERN WITH CONCUR A SENATOR UMBERG. SO -- ACTS ARE COMING TO MORE GENERAL TO THE PROGRAM WE THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THE STATE IS TRYING TO UTILIZE ITS PURCHASING POWER WE THINK IT'S PART OF THAT IN OUR P. PROCESS THAT THERE'S THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY. ASK QUESTIONS OF THOSE THAT WE CONTRACT THEY'RE HELD TO HIGH STANDARDS AND ALSO THAT THAT GOES DOWN CHANGE TO THAT -- IF. AIRLINE X. -- CONTRACTS WITH SO COUNTER SO CHARACTER WHAT SUBCONTRACTOR WHY THAT ARE ALSO MEETING THE SAME STANDARD SO WE WANT TO HAVE THAT I WORK IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN THE CHAIR -- WILL CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION BUT WE HAVE SOME -- MEMBERS HERE TODAY THAT WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AS WELL ABOUT THE ABOUT THE PROGRAM THANK YOU THANK YOU.

WE WE WE THANK YOU AND WE HOPE FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE BENEFITS ARE BEING EXTENDED TO WORKERS AT THE AIRPORTS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WELL -- I THINK THAT LEADS TO A FEW QUESTIONS. ON THIS PROGRAM BUT I THINK IN GENERAL. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE STATE THERE WERE CONTRACTING OR SUBCONTRACTING WITH -- AND USING A TAXPAYER RESOURCES TOWARDS -- COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT VIOLATING. LABOR LAWS AND OR PROVIDING LIVING WAGES. THIS CERTAINLY MADAM CHAIR IT'S A FAIR QUESTION AND AND JUST -- TO THE CARD IS IN A RECOGNIZE THE THE STORIES OF CALIFORNIANS OF REAL PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. AND CERTAINLY THIS ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO ENSURING ALL OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE A LIVING WAGE AND I ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE AND ALL THE THINGS SPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE OUT HARD WORKING THE TOUGH JOBS -- THAT WE ALL NEED HIM FOR I THINK THAT'S CLEAR CLEAR POINT BY THE WITNESSES AND SOMETHING THAT WE ALL TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THANKS -- WITH THAT I AM I THINK WE TO SPEAK SPECIFIC TO THE PROGRAM AN ITEM BEFORE US BUT ALSO BE RESPECTFUL OF YOUR QUESTION. OF KIND OF HIGHER LEVEL DETAILS AROUND HOW WE CONTRACT -- AT THE STATE LEVEL SO MATT BENDER HAS JOINED US FROM OUR LEGISLATIVE OFFICE USE THAT KIND OF THE EXPERT ON ALL THINGS CONTRACTING -- SPECIFIC TO THE CONTRACT -- THAT I THINK IS MENTIONED BOTH IN THE STAFF REPORT AND CLEARLY SEVERAL IN A SPOKE. TO LA ACTS AND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES ARE THINK WE WE WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE DO HAVE A REALLY WHAT IS A SAVINGS CONTRACTS THAT WE PUT OUT -- RECOGNIZING THAT THE STATE HAS PURCHASING POWER AND SO -- WE GO OUT AND TRY TO FIND AIRLINES WILL GIVE US THE DISCOUNT AND SAVE AS MUCH MONEY FOR THE STATE AS POSSIBLE ON THE CONTRACT CURRENTLY THAT WE HAD TO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WHO DOES PROVIDE A DISCOUNT. A DISCOUNTED FARE TO USERS. AS A RESULT THAT CONTRACT RESULTS IN ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN ANNUAL SAVINGS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CONTRACT IS UP AT THE END OF THIS YEAR IS THAT THE STAFF REPORT ALSO POINTS OUT WE'RE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING. WHAT NEXT -- QUITE HONESTLY EVEN WITHOUT THAT CONTRACT WERE STILL TRAVELING RIGHT THIS TRAVELS HAVING A STATE REGARDLESS OF THE CONTRACT WERE TRYING TO MAXIMIZE VALUE FOR THE STATE THROUGH THE CONTRACT -- WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DISCUSS WITH YOU AND AND ANY OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES INCLUDING -- MEMBERS OF SEATO IN THEIR LEADERSHIP ABOUT HOW WE MAKE THAT A RESPONSIBLE CONTRACT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STAPLES HAS THE AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO DO SO THROUGH OVERSIGHT -- BUT WITH THAT YOUR BROADER QUESTION I THINK I'LL LET MATCH I'M IN IT AND AND THAT'S YOUR QUESTION REGARDING POSSIBLE CON. IS OKAY -- MET BETTER DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES OF THE YOU KNOW THE THE GENERAL REQUIREMENT THAT -- BETTER BE A RESPONSIBLE BETTER IS -- CLICKABLE ACROSS ALL AREAS OF PUBLIC CONTRACTING OF PUBLIC WORKS GOOD SERVICES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN DETERMINING WHETHER. A BIDDERS ARE RESPONSIBLE BETTER WERE GUIDED BY STATE LAW INCLUDING -- NUMBER DECISIONS OVER THE YEARS BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC WAGE AND BENEFIT REQUIREMENTS FOR PEOPLE WORKING -- FOR CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO THE STATE THERE ARE TWO MAIN AREAS WHERE THOSE ARE REGULATED -- THE ONE IS AND PUBLIC WORKS WHERE TRAITS PEOPLE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RAILING WAGE LAW. THAT INCLUDES BOTH STATE PROJECTS AND SOME STATES SPOT STATE SPONSORED PROJECTS WERE THE STATE IS. EFFECTIVELY. CAUSING THE PROJECT TO HAPPEN AND JASON MAY BE IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXACT BOUNDARY CHASE MAY BE BLE TO ADDRESS THOSE. THE OTHER IS AND THE SPECIFICS OF SERVICES. CALLED OUT INSPECTION NINETEEN ONE THIRTY FOR THE GOVERNMENT CODE -- THOSE -- JANITORIAL HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES CUSTODIANS FOOD SERVICE WORKERS LAUNDRY WORKERS WINDOW CLEANERS. AND SECURITY GUARD SERVICES AND SORRY WHAT SECTION WAS -- NINETEEN ONE THIRTY FOR THE PUBLIC CONTRACT. OF SORRY MIKE. GOVERNMENT CODE -- A HANDS. WHEN WHEN THE STATE IS CONTRACTING SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE SERVICES -- THE PROVISION THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY PROVIDE EMPLOYEE WAGES AND BENEFITS. THAT ARE VALUED AT AT LEAST 85% OF THE STATE EMPLOYER COST PER WAGES AND BENEFITS IN THE COMPARABLE -- STATE JOB CLASSIFICATION -- WE CASUALLY GET THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT -- THAT SOMEBODY ISN'T DOING THAT IN -- AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE LOOK INTO IT WE TALKED WITH THE CONTRACTOR WE TALK WITH THE EMPLOYEES AND WE DO OUR BEST TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND GET THE CONTRACTOR IN COMPLIANCE IF THEY'RE NOT [inaudible] OKAY -- YOU KNOW I I CAN APPRECIATE THAT -- LOOKING FOR THE VALUE AND USING OUR CONSUMER POWER -- AND I KNOW THAT'S WHY I APPLAUD THE PROGRAM AS WELL -- FOR DOING THAT -- AT THE SAME TIME -- IF THAT RESULT IF PART OF THAT NOT DIRECTLY BUT IT ONE THING IS FOR A COMPANY THEN TURNS AROUND. AND DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT -- SO ALL THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO I TALKED ABOUT HAVING HAD MEDICAL INSURANCE. PRIOR TO A DIFFERENT COMPANY COMING IN. A BY THE END CONTACTED BY THE AIRLINE OR HAVING OTHER -- VERY IMPORTANT THINGS IN THEIR LIVES WAGES. SO HERE WE ARE HELPING OUR YOU KNOW LOOKING AT VALUE AS GREEN IN OR SAVING US MONEY BUT THEN. THOSE SAY MEN AND WOMEN MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO END UP HAVING TO GET PUBLIC SERVICES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD. OR THEN I GIVEN THE HEALTH INSURANCE SO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THERE TAXPAYERS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. THAT THE VALUE SHOULD BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE THE WELL BEING OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PROVIDE THAT THE SERVICES SO -- I THINK WE'RE GONNA PULL THIS OPEN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION -- I APPRECIATE ALL THE GOOD WORK OF THE TROUBLE PROGRAM I THINK WE HAVE TO DO MUCH MORE IN THE AREA OF WHETHER IT'S A DIRECT. A COMPANY THAT WE'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH OR SUBCONTRACTOR OF THAT COMPANY. SO THEY COULD GET OUT OF NOT DOING OF WHAT THEY SHOULD I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION. TO HI THANK YOU SENATOR. THE MORE THINGS -- WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS OPEN -- OKAY CLICK ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO TESTIFIED TODAY. SO THAT NEXT ISSUE IS ISSUE NUMBER -- NINE THIS IS OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE SERVICE OF WOMEN INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT AND FACILITY DEVELOPMENT REQUESTS -- THIS IS ACTUALLY THE THIRD YEAR WE ARE BRINGING UP THE STUFF YOU SEE PEOPLE THIS PROGRAM BEFORE -- THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. TWO YEARS AGO OR ASK. FOR THIS PROGRAM TO INSTALL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FLEET AND WORKPLACE THROUGHOUT STATE FACILITIES THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME REQUESTED THAT INSTEAD OF PROVING A FIVE YEAR PLAN THEY WANT US -- TO BOTH MAKE TO ASK FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE PREVIOUS -- SUCCESSES OF THE PROGRAM AND WHERE WERE KIND OF CHANGING AND SHIFTING IT FOR CHANGING SHIFTING SO THIS YEAR'S REQUEST IS FOR A TOW -- ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION -- TO OUR SERVICE REVOLVING FUND CASH AUTHORITY THE OTHER 50% IS JUST AUTHORITY TO THE SERVICE REVOLVING FUND -- TUNES -- SUPPORT THE INSTALLATION -- ZERO USING ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- WITH ME SAID NANCY AND WHOSE ARE DRIFTING DIRECTOR OF THE SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM WHO CAN SPEAK IN DETAIL TO BOTH OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE THUS FAR IN THE WORK WE HAVE BEFORE US -- BUT WE'RE HAPPY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE THEM. I'M SORRY ALEJO'S. WE JUST HAD A COUPLE COMING CONSISTENT WITH SOME F THE COMMENTS WE MADE IN PAST YEARS AS AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR THAT UP SIMILAR PROPOSALS COME FORWARD -- MAINLY OR COMMENT CENTER AROUND ON THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY AMBITIOUS -- GOAL AND THIS IS JUST FIRST THIS IS FOR STATE THESE CHARGING STATIONS -- AT STATE FACILITIES BOTH FOR EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS FOR STATE VEHICLES -- SO THIS WITH THIS PLAN THIS FIVE YEAR PLAN WOULD BE ABOUT NINETY FOUR MILLION -- AND SUPPORT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHARGING -- CHARGERS BASICALLY HI TO SERVE THOSE KINDS OF VEHICLES BUT REALLY THE GOALS ARE EVEN BEYOND THAT AND SO THAT THE COST COULD BE SOMEWHAT MORE THAN NOT. AND SO WE JUST NOTED IN THE PAST THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER GIVEN THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS WEATHER -- IT WOULD LIKE TO SPEND GENERAL FUND WHICH IS CERTAINLY AN OPTION AND IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE OR OTHER FUNDING SOURCES WHICH HAVE BEEN USED FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE -- THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND ON THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER FUND THAT'S BEEN USED FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN THE PAST THE ALTERNATIVE. AND RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM OF FUND SO THERE ARE SOME OTHER FUNDING SOURCES DEPENDING ON THE DECIDED PRIORITIES WE JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT FOR FOLKS [inaudible] OKAY. NO COMMENT OKAY CENTERS. SANDERS MAN I IT JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION -- WE DO HAVE THE THE STATE'S GOAL OF FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROADS BY TWENTY THIRTY SO HOW DOES OUR PROGRAM FIT INTO THAT. SO AS YOU KNOW THAT IS A VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE GOAL I THINK THAT WITH THE STATE THAT AND THE NUMBER THAT WE WILL BE INSTALLING IS A MUCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THAT HOWEVER I WOULD SAY THAT IT HAS. A SIGNIFICANCE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP BY THE STATE AS WELL AS BEING AN EXAMPLE -- SO WE WOULD BE ABLE THE INFLUENCE INDUSTRY FOR INSTANCE -- TO IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION IN TERMS OF EMPLOYEE ADOPTION OF VEHICLES IT CETERA BUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER THAT WE WILL BE INSTALLING IS A MUCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THAT FIVE MILLION. SO -- CAN WE GET SORT THAT IN FOR MORE INFORMATION AS TO MORE INFORMATION AS TO I KNOW IT'S SMALL. BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE WHAT KIND OF INFLUENCE WE CAN HAVE THE STREET -- IS OUR WAY OF YOU KNOW DESCRIBING THAT MORE THAN WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE INFLUENCE. AT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF CHARGERS WE EXPECT INSTALL AND WITH THE FIVE YEAR FUNDING IS. SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED BUT I'M JUST SAYING IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED IN THE STATE CODE -- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED THE FIVE MILLION IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO SUPPLY THE STATE FLEET WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPLY A 100% OF WHAT THE STATE FLEET NEEDS. IN TERMS OF EMPLOYEE ADOPTION WE ARE PROJECTING SOMEWHERE HIGHER THAN 5% OUR NUMBERS ARE BASED ON A 5% ADOPTION BUT WE'RE EXPECTING IT COULD BE EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT 5210% EVEN SO. A IN TERMS OF JUST MEETING THE STATE NEEDS IT COULD BE EVEN DOUBLE THIS NUMBER [inaudible] RIGHT. THE MORE COMMON THING. THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS OPEN RIGHT. ALL RIGHT -- I'M SORRY PUBLIC COMMENT NONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK HIM SANDERS THANK YOU SENATOR OUT WILL MOVE INTO ISSUE. TEN THIS IS OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ITEM -- HISTORICALLY IN THE BUDGET CENTER NIELSEN I'M SURE KNOWS AS WELL AS THE WE'VE HAD A CONTROL SECTION SIX POINT ONE WHICH WAS ALLOCATE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS TO DIFFERENT APARTMENTS IT DUE TO FOR ME. PROJECTS -- THIS YEAR THE APPROACH YOU WITH A REQUEST IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF FUNDS FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS WILL BE DOING THE SAME -- TO DO SPECIFIC PROJECTS SO WE ARE REQUESTING SIXTEEN MILLION -- IN THIS FISCAL YEAR AND GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES ALREADY TO ADDRESS -- FEW CRITICAL DEFERRED MEANS PROJECTS INTERSTATE BUILDINGS -- WITH ME -- TO FOR THIS ONE I'VE JAMAL MANY IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR A FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OKAY [inaudible] OF CURRENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO AS THE DEPARTMENT REFERENCE THIS IS REALLY A PART OF A NUMBER PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING FORWARD THIS YEAR REGARDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION. DOLLARS WORTH OF THOSE PROPOSALS ACROSS MORE THAN TWENTY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ARE COMMENTS AS AN OFFICE ARE ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT ACROSS THOSE SO IT'S IN THE THINGS I'M. GONNA MENTION -- REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT OF JOURNAL GENERAL SERVICES ALSO -- APPLY TO THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT VETERANS DEPARTMENT WHICH I HEAR ABOUT LATER ON TODAY AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE HURT BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WANTED TO POINT OUT -- AS WAS REFERENCE THIS IS WE'VE PROVIDED SOME SIGNIFICANT FUNDING IN THIS AREA IN THE PAST -- AS A STATE -- ACTUALLY ABOUT I THINK ONE POINT. THREE REALLY SIGNIFICANT -- INVESTMENTS IN TRYING TO TACKLE ARE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG -- BUT THEY'RE STILL QUITE A BIT OF IDENTIFIED NEED ACROSS MANY DEPARTMENTS. WE HAVE REALLY TWO MAIN -- AREAS OF RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THESE PROPOSALS -- AND THE FIRST IS REALLY THAT -- THAT. ESTHER I'LL BE ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE REPORT ON THE PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN AND THE REASON FOR THAT OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. THIS YEAR'S APPROACH DIFFERS FROM PAST YEARS APPROACHES WITH THE CONTROL SECTION SO THIS YEAR BASICALLY DEPARTMENTS ARE GONNA BE PROVIDED WITH -- KIND OF A LUMP SUM AMOUNT AND DEPARTMENTS WILL IDENTIFY THE PROJECT THAT THEY'RE GONNA AND UNDERTAKE SOME PROJECT SOME DEPARTMENTS HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED THOSE PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE TGS HAS IDENTIFIED SOME PROJECT THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING TO UNDERTAKE. IDENTIFIED THOSE PROJECTS -- BUT EVEN IF THE DEPARTMENT HAVE IDENTIFIED AS PROJECTS THE WAY THAT THAT -- MECHANISM IS SET UP THEY COULD MAKE CHANGES TO THOSE PROJECTS SUBSEQUENTLY AND SO REALLY THIS REPORTING LANGUAGE WOULD JUST ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE INFORMATION -- ON WHAT PROJECTS ARE ULTIMATELY UNDER TO RIGHT WHICH PROJECTS WERE UNDERTAKEN IN KIND OF TRACK THAT I'M IN THAT WOULDN'T BE TOO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT DEPARTMENTS ARE CURRENTLY DOING WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVED IN PAST YEARS THEY'VE. THEY'VE TRACKED WHAT PROJECT THEY ULTIMATELY HAVE UNDERTAKEN. REALLY THE SECOND ON MAJOR AREA OF RECOMMENDATION FOR ASK IS RELATED TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAINTAINING OUR BUILDINGS ON AN ONGOING BASIS BETTER. SO I THEY MENTION WE'VE WE'VE INVESTED QUITE A BIT OF STATE FUNDING AND IN DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE -- OVER THE YEARS AND WE STILL IN MANY CASES HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG -- AND THAT'S TRUE FOR EXAMPLE FOR TGS -- SO IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHEN WE STARTED PROVIDING THEM WITH FUNDS THE BACKLOG WAS IDENTIFIED AT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION. AND NOW IT'S TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION AND WE HAVE -- WE'VE GIVEN THEM TWENTY SEVEN MILLION IN THAT TIME FRAME SO THERE BACK LIKE IT'S CONTINUED TO GROW EVEN WITH THESE ADDITIONAL INFUSIONS OF FINES -- THAT POINTS TO POTENTIALLY -- MAYBE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THEIR ON GOING MAINTENANCE PROGRAM THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT FINDING IT SUFFICIENTLY OR MAYBE TERE ARE OTHER ISSUES GOING ON THERE -- OR MAYBE WE'RE JUST NOT TRACKING IT WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE PROBABLY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE -- POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THAT AND AND TO KIND OF KEEP UP WITH THEIR ON GOING MAINTENANCE. AND SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT BECAUSE WE REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING TO PROVIDE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING EVERY YEAR RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD. PROVIDE FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG AND THEN WE SHOULD TRY TO ENCOURAGE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE BETTER MAINTENANCE POLICIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO WE DON'T CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THIS BACKLOG. ON SO PART OF THAT WE THINK IS HAVING DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THIS -- ONE REPORTED BUDGET HEARINGS LIKE THIS ON ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIR BUILDINGS ARE MAINTAIN SUFFICIENTLY ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- AND ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT IS AGAIN SOME SOME SUPPLEMENT REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT WE THINK WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH WOULD HAVE THE DEPARTMENT REPORT. IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONLINE WHAT ITS BACKLOG AS AND IT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S GROWN IN THE INTERIM AT THAT POINT THEY SHOULD HAVE. MOM LIKELY SPENT THESE FUNDS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE BACK LIKE HAS CONTINUED TO GROW WE REQUIRE REPORT FROM THEM ON WHAT THEIR PLAN IS NOW ON WHY IT'S GROWN AND WHAT THEIR PLAN IS TO ADDRESS IT -- BECAUSE WE REALLY DO YOU THINK THAT -- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET A BETTER HANDLE ON HOW DO WE HAVE BETTER ON GOING MAINTENANCE PRACTICES -- ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE SUMMARY PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] QUICK FINAL. JUMP BETTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- THE REPORTING STRUCTURE UNDER THE EXPLAIN WHY NO DIFFERS FROM THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH THIS YEARAND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS -- OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW -- TO BAKER AN EFFECTIVE IN TARGETED REPORTING STRUCTURE FOR THIS PARTICULAR STATEWIDE. BATCH OF PROPOSALS. OKAY. SO I WHICH WE'RE TRYING ARE YOU TRYING TO GET. A ARE YOU TRYING TO GET TO A OF MASTER LIST OF ALL THE DEFERRED. MAINTENANCE. BY DEPARTMENT AND THEN IN TOTAL FOR THE STATE. SO -- TYPICALLY THE PART THAT WITH AT LEAST THE YEAH BUT IDEA OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET. EXACTLY ALL OF THEM SO IT ACTUALLY OVER IT IN RECENT YEARS -- DEPARTMENTS HAVE PUT TOGETHER A LIST OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT MAKE UP THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG SOMETIMES IT'S TAKEN A SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THE BUDGETS BEEN INTRODUCED -- TO TO HAVE THOSE WITH SOLIDIFIED BUT THOSE LISTS EXIST -- AND SOMETIMES THEY'VE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME SO WE'VE BEEN GETTING THOSE LESSONS I THINK TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND IF YOU LOOK ACROSS DEPARTMENT SOMETIMES THEY'VE GONE UP AND DOWN IN PROJECT THE PHONE UP AND YOU'D EXPECT SOME OF THAT BECAUSE YOUR BUILDING'S AGING NEW THINGS COME UP. IT IS THAT THE LEVEL OF CHANGES OVER FROM YEAR TO YEAR HAVE BEEN -- HARD TO EXPLAIN I THINK OUR RECOMMENDATION SO WE HAVE THAT -- IN MANY CASES THIS YEAR ALTHOUGH NOT IN ALL CASES. I THINK OUR WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW -- WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS INFORMATION ON WHAT PROJECTS ARE ULTIMATELY UNDERTAKEN WITH THESE FUNDS BECAUSE? OF BAG THE CURRENT APPROACH WOULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE ANY WAY OF KNOWING WHICH SPECIFIC PROJECTS ARE ULTIMATELY FUNDED WITH THESE FUNDS AND IN SOME CASES -- PLACE WITH PAST FINDING SOME OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT NOT NECESSARILY FOR FOR DJ SPECIFICALLY BUT IN SOME CASES THEY'VE BEEN VERY LARGE PROJECTS -- MANY YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- INDIVIDUALLY SO SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN VERY LARGE I'M IN SOME CASES DEPARTMENTS HAVE CONSIDERED PROJECTS THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE THINGS THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SO WE THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT'S GOING TO GO -- ME WHAT'S ALTERNATELY FIND IT AND THAT THAT THAT ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY WILL BE HELPFUL AND I'LL HELP IT'S JUST TRACK BETTER -- KIND OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THOSEBACKLOGS -- MEET AT NEAR FROM YEAR TO YEAR THE PRACTICES IN BASIS. OKAY -- JUST TO JUST ONE QUESTION -- BABY USING YOUR DEPARTMENT -- THAT WOULD HELP US FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS IS HOW WOULD YOU PRIORITIZE A PROJECTS. OR HOW HAE YOU PRIORITIZE THE PROJECTS. SO WE'VE WE'VE GONE THROUGH -- A GREAT DEAL OF CONSIDERATION INTERNALLY AND THEN ALSO LIVED IN OF THE PARTNERS -- WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT EVEN IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE WORKED OUTSIDE OF AGING -- OUR DEPARTMENT WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ON THE SAME PAGE AND IF YOU IF YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE CATEGORY OF PROJECTS THEY'RE ALL -- THEY'LL KIND OF FILE ON THE FIVE GENERAL CATEGORIES -- WE'VE LISTED AT LEAST THREE IN OUR ANALYSIS AND AND REALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT FAR LIFE AND SAFETY ISSUES THE MOST IMMEDIATE ONCE YOU HAVE TO DRESS RIGHT AWAY. THE ONE AND AFTER THAT YOU HAVE CRITICAL ONES WHICH COULD LEAD FIRED BY. ANY OF THE INSPECTION SERVICES OR THE ADMINISTRATION OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND STATE AS WELL AS OUR TOP THREE PRIORITIES AFTER THAT I MEAN. IT REALLY KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE EMERGENCIES THAT WERE RESPONDING TO A REQUEST -- FROM OTHER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IS MORE LIKE REAL. IN ALMOST EMERGENCY IT IS FOR THE AGE OF OUR BUILDINGS AND FOR THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE TALKING BY SPACE IN THIS PROPOSAL RETIREMENT ELEVATORS AND PILOT AND SAFETY SYSTEMS. THESE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW WE NEED TO REPLACE IMMEDIATELY. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY OF DRIVEN IT. WOULD TO PUBLIC. PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. OKAY SO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVE THE REQUESTED FUNDING FOR THE DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE. ON THE TOP SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE RECORDING RETRIEVED CHOIR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO NOTIFY THE CHAIR. OF THE JAIL BC PRIOR TO ALLOCATING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING TO THE DEPARTMENTS. I HAVE A MOTION [inaudible] OKAY. SENATOR DORADO YES. CENTER NIELSEN NO. SENATOR UMBERG YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER I'M GONNA PASS ON TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER KENNY WHO WILL HANDLE THE CAP ALI ITEMS. WELL. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- FOR ITEMS ELEVEN TWELVE AND THIRTEEN WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO RUN THROUGH THE ABUSE OR TREAT THEM SEPARATELY HAVEN'T YOU LIKE ME. TO THEY'RE ALL FREE CAPPELLI PROPOSALS ON THREE PUBLIC PROJECTS -- WELL WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR THEM OKAY ALL SEPARATELY BUT YOU COULD DESCRIBE THEM. TOGETHER. AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK IN VOTE. FOR THEM SEPARATELY. TO DO EARLY DESIGN PHASES WE ARE NOW -- ASKING FOR THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OR DEMOLITION FUNDS -- TO KNOCK DOWN THAT BUILDING -- THIS IS A SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLD COMPLEX THAT IS GROSSLY OVER SIZED AT ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND GROW SQUARE FEET -- RIGHT NOW THE PRINT PLAN OCCUPIES -- A PERCENTAGE OF THAT -- AND OTHER ACTUALLY RELOCATING TO LEASE SPACE -- AND IT'S ABOUT A 75% SPACE REDUCTION TO GIVE YOU A SENSE FOR HOW OVERSIZED FACILITY IS -- IT IS WELL PAST ITS USEFUL LIFE -- DILAPIDATED THE FOUNDATION IS FAILING -- IT DOESN'T HAVE CENTRAL HEATING THERE CAN'T BE REPURPOSE FOR OTHER USES -- AND THE BUILDING AND THE SITE ITSELF IS. ON SITEYOU HAVE AS BEST AS LEAD ARSENIC MERCURY -- GOT PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IN THE DIRT -- THERE IS -- UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS -- THAT NEED TO BE REMEDIATED -- WHEN THE PRINT THAT WAS ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY CREATED WAS BACK WITH THE STATE PRINTER ACTUALLY PRINTED TEXT BOOKS FOR CALIFORNIA AND THEY LITERALLY BOB TRANSPORTED THEM VIA TRAIN ACROSS THE STATE? TO THE RAILROAD SPUR LIKE ON THE PROPERTY ITSELF IN THE THE REMEDIATED IT'S AN ANTIQUE ANTIQUATED -- FACILITY ITSELF -- WE WE WOULD WE NEED TO TAKE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS OF DIRT AND REMEDIATED TO DISPOSE OF IT -- IT IS A CONTAMINATED SITE -- SO THIS PROJECT WILL BE REQUESTING TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FOR THE ACTUAL DEMOLITION. OF THE SECOND PROJECT BEFORE YOU IS THE RICHARD BOULEVARD COMPLEX -- WE ARE REQUESTING -- ONE BILLION IN LEASE REVENUE BOND FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A OF A COMPLEX A LITTLE TO CONTACT FOR THIS PROJECT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THAT UPDATED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AT LEGISLATIVE REQUEST. DIGITS COMMISSION INDEPENDENT FIRM DO A LONG RANGE PLANNING STUDY FOR SACRAMENTO OFFICE SPACE -- THAT LONG RANGE PLANNING STUDY IT IDENTIFY -- FOR SPACE ACT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH SPACE IN SACRAMENTO FOR THE PROJECTED GROWTH OF STATE EMPLOYEES -- AND WE'RE FINDING THAT OUT -- JUST IN PRACTICE EVERY DAY -- WE ARE SEEING THAT SACRAMENTO IS IMPACTED LEASING PERSPECTIVE J. L. L. WHICH IS A A NATIONAL REAL ESTATE FIRM IS ADVISING CLIENTS THAT THEY EXPECT RATESIN SACRAMENTO TO GO BETWEEN 78% ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS -- IN FACT WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING LESSORS ATTEMPTING TO HIKE RATES UP -- ONE VERY LARGE LEASE IN SACRAMENTO -- AND DURING REGIONAL GLACIATIONS A LESSOR -- WAS VERY INSISTENT ON A 30% INCREASE OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM A 30% INCREASE -- BUT IT'S REFLECTIVE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE MARKET. IN SO -- IN LIGHT OF THE LONG TERM PLANNING SPACE NEEDS DIGEST PROPOSED IN PREVIOUS YEARS THREE BUILDING PROJECTS THIS IS THE THIRD OF THOSE BUILDING PROJECTS THE FINAL -- ONE THE OTHER TWO BUILDING PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE BOTH ARE ON BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE -- WE ARE ULTIMATELY LOOKING TO LEVERAGE THESE BUILDINGS TO ADDRESS OUR MOST EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AS WAS JUST TESTIFIED THERE IS A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- ISSUE THAT WE HAVE ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO THAT SAME CONSULTANT WHO DID THE PLANNING STUDY ALSO CATALOGS -- WENT THROUGH DID ASSESSMENTS AND EVALUATIONS ARE XIN SEES AND THEN RANK THEM IN TERMS OF SEVERUS AND MOST EFFICIENT BUILDINGS -- UP WE CAME OVER THE SEQUENCING PLAN AS WE BUILD THESE NEW BUILDINGS WILL TAKE TENANTS FROM THE MOST EFFICIENT SPACE PUT THEM INTO THE NEW BUILDING'S. RENOVATE THE SPACE BEHIND THEM AND THEY TAKE TENANTS FROM THE NEXT MOST EFFICIENT SPACE AND PUT THEM IN THOSE BUILDINGS AND RENOVATIONS TO ADDRESS OUR DEFICIENCIES -- THIS IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE WAY OF OF DOING THAT -- THESE BUILDINGS ARE ALSO -- THIS ONE AND YOU ALSO -- BUT THE RESOURCES RENOVATION THEY ARE PART OF A NEW BREED OF STATE CONSTRUCTION THAT WE ARE DOING SACRAMENTO THESE PROJECTS -- HAVE BOTH PROJECT LABOR AND COMMITTEE WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS THEY EMPHASIZE AGENCY CONSOLIDATIONS WERE SING BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND 30% REDUCTION IN STATE BUT PRINT BY DOING THESE PROJECTS -- WE ARE LOOKING AT WORKING DEPARTMENTS FOR EFFICIENCY PURPOSES SO -- DOCUMENT SCANNING -- ID CAN ACTUALLY I THINK -- THE BILLION MEASURES -- THEY'RE ALSO DESIGNED THESE PROJECTS FOR FUTURE FLEXIBILITY AND APARTMENT OF GROWTH AND WE ALSO HAVE -- A PRETTY ROBUST IN A VERY UNIQUE I THINK SMALL BUSINESS AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. MONITORING PROCESS AS PART OF THESE PROJECTS. AND THEN FINALLY -- OUR RESOURCES RENOVATION SO I MENTIONED -- THAT STUDY THAT IN FIVE OR MOST EFFICIENT BUILDINGS WELL THIS IS NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST -- IT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT BUILDING THE STATE OWNS -- WE ARE ASKING FOR A POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA TO RENOVATE THE BUILDING. THIS BUILDING WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR IT WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED THE RETIREMENT BUILDING AND IT WAS THE FIRST MAJOR STATE OFFICE BUILDING CONSTRUCTED BY. THE STATE -- YEAH POST WAR ENVIRONMENT -- IT IS ALSO A HISTORIC BUILDING -- THE BUILDING IS IN NEED OF A ALL BUILDING SYSTEMS MECHANICAL PLUMBING ELECTRICAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS NEED TO BE REPLACED -- THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES FOR THE BUILDING INCLUDING. THE NEED TO INSTALL FIRE SPRINKLERS -- WE WILL NEED TO RENOVATE THE THREE STORY A THREE SEVENTEEN STORY STAIRS IN THE BUILDING FOR EXITING FOR BUSES TO MEET CODE AND CORRECT SEISMIC DEFICIENCIES. IT'S COME A BAD THING TO HAVE EXITING STAIRS HAVE SEISMIC DEFICIENCIES -- THE PRECAST PANEL SKIN ON THE BUILDING -- WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT -- WITH WITHSTAND AN EARTHQUAKE MEANING YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE CONCRETE PANELS FALL OFF THE BUILDING A STAFF. IS GREAT BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS SACRAMENTO -- ASBESTOS AND LEAD PAINT OR PERVASIVE IN THE BUILDING THE BUILDING IS NOT ADA COMPLIANT -- WE NEED TO OPERATE UP THE CONTROL LIGHTING SYSTEMS AS WELL IT NEEDS A NEW ROOF AND ELEVATORS [inaudible] THAT'LL. THAT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. WHO WAS EVER WALK INTO A BUILDING LIKE THAT THE TENANTS ARE VERY HAPPY AT THE PROSPECT OF OF GOING TO THE NEW SPECS AND HAVING THE BUILDING RENOVATED? SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON THE PROJECTS. QUESTION BECAUSE TO THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS AS WAS NOTED BY THE DEPARTMENT -- A COUPLE OF THESE ARE JUST BASICALLY CONTINUATIONS OF PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PROJECTS AND A CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE -- EXPECTED THE COST WOULD BE LAST THEY WERE CONSIDERED PREVIOUSLY -- AND THEN THAT RESOURCES RENOVATION AS WAS REFERENCED IS -- IS IDENTIFIED AS A AS A VERY HIGH NEED IN SORT OF NEXT TO NOT PLANNED SO AS LONG AS LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO BE. COMFORTABLE WITH THAT PLAN THAT'S PROBABLY THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP FOR FOR YOU TO UNDERTAKE I'M SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS. THE CONCERT THE CONCERT. I'M JUST SOMETHING RELATED TO WHAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR BIDDING ON THE SELECTION OF SO -- I'LL USE THE THE THE RICHARD BLOOM ARE COMPLEX SO. THAT IS A DESIGN BUILD PROJECT -- SO -- WE OPERATE UNDER PUBLIC CONTRCT CODE.

SAME WITH KELLY TO OUR OR OUR STAFF IF OF THE FUTURE VETERAN IS INTERESTED IN A STATE JOB THEY CAN ME WITH WITH ONE OF OUR FOLKS OR KELLY CHAR. AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS SO MOST OF THEM ARE STILL IN THE MILITARY BUT THERE WERE READY -- TO SEPARATE -- AND WORKFORCE HAS BEEN A PART OF MANY OF OUR PRESENTATIONS OKAY IT'S YOU HAVE A VERY SIMILAR MISSION. SEEMS LIKE IT'S OVERLAPPING IS THAT RIGHT I KNOW SIR -- THERE WE HAVE A LOT MORE -- IN TERMS OF SERVICES AND PRESENTATION AND INFORMATION FOR EDUCATION BENEFITS FOR BUT CALVET HOME LOANS -- ON VETERANS HOMES. AND WE HELP. HELP THEM FIND AND DIRECT THEM TO THE THEIR COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICES SO THAT THEY CAN SEEK AND OBTAIN BENEFITS -- AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO TO GET AND SO SO OKAY SO THEY'RE A LOT MORE. YOU DO A LOT MORE I CAN'T THAT DURING THE BRIDE RIGHT. DO YOU HELP FOLKS FIND A JOB. NOT DIRECTLY -- MOST OF OUR EXPERTISE IS IN THE OTHER BENEFITS. AND THE JOBS THAT WE CAN HELP THEM FIND MORE DIRECTLY ARE WITH THE STATE. I WORK FOR WORRIES COMES IN IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. OKAY -- SO IT YES I'M NOT COME TOGETHER NEW BUT I'M. I'VE BEEN OUT OF THIS BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A I HATE THIS WORD. BUT I USE IT A LOT OF SYNERGY. BECAUSE YOU'RE. AUDIENCE IS EITHER A SIMILAR -- IT'S LEASED A SIMILAR AUDIENCE VETERANS NATIONAL GUARD. SEEMS LIKE THAT. THERE WOULD BE A BENEFIT IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S COMPLETE COORDINATION DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS USEFUL -- YES SIR I THINK OF WHAT WE TRY TO DO AS BEST WE CAN IS COORDINATE WITH THEM AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE INCLUDED IN OUR RIGHT PRESENTATIONS. IN IT AND LIGHTING THE SHOW UP WHAT I MEA IS THAT HAVING AN INTEGRATED. PROJECT. JOIN THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT VETERANS BECAUSE EVERY VETERAN WAS IN THE MILITARY. SO. AND AM I MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING BUT IT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE. THAT WE COULD. CREATE SOME EFFICIENCIES I'M GONNA VOTE I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BUT IT SEEMED MAY WE COME BACK AND TALK. WITH EACH OF YOU ABOUT HOW WE COULD CREATE SOME EFFICIENCIES. IN TRYING TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. TO FOLKS LEAVING THE YOU'RE LEAVING THE MILITARY. YOU WANT A JOB YOU'RE GOING TO HELP WITH STATE JOBS RIGHT. JOBS BUT A PERSON LEAVING THE MILITARY. JUST ONCE A JOB. RIGHT.

IT WILL LEAVE THIS DAY WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU ANY ADDITIONAL IMMIGRATION ALL EAT TOGETHER YEAH. RIGHT OKAY THANKS USER. JUST JUST ONE MORE QUESTION -- HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE OF? HOW'S THE PROGRAM PRIORITIZING. TARGETED DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE TO BE BEST SERVED THOSE ARE OR MAYBE THOSE MOST IN NEED TO PRIORITIZE AND ANYWAY. WELL WAY -- LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE COUNTIES IN THE LOCATIONS THE THE LINKS HELP WITH THAT BY BEING ON THE GROUND IN THOSE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS -- DOING RESEARCH TO FIND OUT THE TYPE OF VETERAN THAT IS LIKELY TO BE THE IN THAT AREA -- IN CERTAIN AREAS. THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF AN INTEREST AND VETERANS HOMES -- AND GETTING A CALVIN HOME LOANS AND IN OTHER AREAS. PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNGER VETERANS -- THE HIGHER EDUCATION BENEFITS SO OF THE EMPHASIS USUALLY COMES. MOVE IN THE PRESENTATIONS BUT ALSO IN THE ONE ON ONE SESSIONS THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE PROGRAM I THINK -- DOES ITS BEST WORK SO WE'LL WE HAVE A GENERAL PRESENTATION AND THEY THEY MAKE APPOINTMENTS AFTERWARDS AND MEET ONE ON ONE TO TO TALK WITH THE CVS SO ARE OTHER MEMBERS WHO PRESENTED. ON THERE'S INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND I'VE SEEN THAT PERSONALLY SO IT IT HELPS TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO KNOW SO THEY TEND TO GET GET TAILORED BY SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND THE PRE RESEARCH WE DO GOING INTO THE? EVENT -- BUT A LOT OF THAT IS DONE IN THE ONE ON ONE SESSIONS. ANY MORE QUESTIONS NOT. FOR TODAY SO WE'LL. WITH CENTER NUMBER FOLLOW UP YES YEAH WITH HIS WITH THE ISSUES I THINK THE REALLY GREAT IDEAS. OKAY. ALEJO'S. JACKIE BRISTOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE REYES NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD NOTE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS ON WHEN THIS PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY CREATED IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE DEPARTMENT TO DO SOME WORK TO IDENTIFY TARGET POPULATIONS AS YOU'RE REFERENCING AND THEY PARTICULAR IDENTIFY -- TO ACTIVE DUTY SERVICEMEMBERS OF TRANSITIONING OUT I'M RETURNING BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE AND STUDENT VETERANS SO THEY'RE CURRENTLY I'M SURVEYING AND DOING THESE PRESENTATIONS AT MILITARY INSTALLATIONS -- CAPTURING THAT ACTIVE DUTY -- MEMBER POPULATION IN THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY THAN TAKING IT TO THE NEXT STEP TO TARGET AND DO SERVICE DELIVERY FOR THE SECOND IDENTIFIED POPULATION PROCESS WHICH IS STUDENT VETERANS. SO QUESTION THAT WE WOULD RAISE IN GENERAL IS MORE OF THIS LONG TERM PLAN TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY OTHER TARGET POPULATIONS WHAT WITH THOSE LOOK LIKE -- HOW WOULD THEY EXPAND THEIR SERVICE DELIVERY TO TARGET THOSE POPULATIONS AND WHERE -- WHAT ACCESS POINTS WITH A PARTICULARLY BE LOOKING AT AND THEN ALSO JUST BROADER QUESTIONS ABOUT LEVEL OF SERVICES WHILE NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CURRENT PROPOSAL OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT BROADER?

WE ARE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK HERE AND DO A BUNCH OF REMEDIATION WRECKED A COUPLE OF THE OTHER THINGS IS IS THAT WITHIN THE READING AREA I GO IN PARTICULAR. THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF WILDFIRES -- THAT HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY CLOSE TO THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY -- REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT MORRELL BUILDING WAS THERE ARE NOT WE MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN OBLIGATED TO JUST INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON THE PROPERTY ITSELF -- JUST BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT RISKS THAT ARE THERE.

GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU A GERMAN -- MADAM CHAIR -- FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY YES SO -- I AM THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE pMINORITY IN UNDER REPRESENTED VETERANS A DIVISION AND ALSO I OVERSEE THE STATE. DVD PROGRAM AS OF JULY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TO ADD TO YOUR QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THAT POINT. THAT WAS FOUND IN THE AUDIT. I YES WE DO IT KNOWLEDGE THAT AT CAL THAT AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS ON THAT IMPROVEMENT IN HARMONY WITH THE TGS. AND SINCE THAT ACTUALLY BEFORE SINCE BEFORE I JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND BOTH WHILE THE AUDIT WAS BEING CONDUCTED. AND WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS A STEPS IN VARIOUS WAYS ONE OF THOSE STEPS IS -- DISSOLVING THE INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD MORE TOWARDS THE MILITARY VETERANS CODE AND THAT OUTLINES OUR DUTIES THERE IN REGARDS TO WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENTS. AND ALSO INCREASE YOUR NUMBERS A DVD MAKING SURE THOSE TV'S ARE SUCCESSFUL. I AT THAT TIME BEFORE THIS DATE WE WERE MORE IN LINE WITH. WHAT D. G. S. WAS DOING THE WASN'T WE WEREN'T SO MUCH FOLLOWING THAT -- THAT GO TO THERE ARE SOME CONFUSION WHICH OUT WITH STATE AND THE AUDIT AS WELL. SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF YOUR OWN INTERNAL AUDIT AND WITH RESPECT TO LEASES AND SO FORTH. SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S OVERLAP WITH THE GS IS THAT RIGHT. I I USED FOR INTO MEETING -- BRENT RUNNING LEASES LIKE MANAGING YOU SAID THAT. INTERNALLY YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO IN ESSENCE -- I I SUPPOSE MANAGE LEASES AN AUDIT IS THAT RIGHT WELL WE WE CURRENTLY ALREADY -- I I GUESS LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK SO SO THE DEPARTMENT CHEN SERVICES HAS HAS AUTHORITY APPROVAL THIRTY ULTIMATELY FOR ALL LEASES -- OF OF STATE PROPERTY I'M SURE THERE'S SOME EXCEPTIONS BUT FOR ALL OF OUR OF A LEASES -- DONE PROBABLY GO THROUGH THE GST GET APPROVED BY TGS -- AND SO THERE'S THEY HAVE WHO WHO PROVEN BUT I'M. IT'S IT'S A COME UPON US TO ACTUALLY OPERATE THEM SO EIGHT YOU KNOW DID YES ISN'T NECESSARILY AT THE OFFER VETERANS HOME FOR EXAMPLE. WITH MANAGING LEASES MANAGING RELATIONS WITH -- WITH LESSEES MAKING SURE THE COMPLYING WITH TERMS OF LEASES THOSE SORTS OF THINGS -- SO WE'RE STILL WE STOP HUGE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER SPACES IS ARE OVERLAP BETWEEN D. G. S. AND YOU WITH RESPECT TO MANAGING LEASES. YES CORRECT OKAY. SO I'LL LEAVE THIS AGAIN FOR ANOTHER DAY. IT IT IT IT SEEMS LIKE TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES THAT. JUST ORGANIZATIONALLY THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES EITHER YOU'VE GOT. A LOT OF FOLKS INVOLVED OR YOU GOT NOBODY INVOLVES SO I'LL LEAVE IT FOR ANOTHER DAY AS TO HOW. CALVET BGS ARE GOING TO DIVIDE UP RESPONSIBILITIES. THE OTHER. IT'S A QUESTION WITH RESPECT I'VE READ BOTH THE AUDITS I JUST READ THE DVB AUDITS. IT'S IT'S SO INTERESTING -- SO IS ANYBODY THERE EVER TRY TO ASK A QUESTION. BY PRETENDING THERE A DV B. E. BECAUSE I'VE DONE THIS WITH THE DMV OF DONE THIS WITH. AL THAT I'VE DONE THIS WITH THE GS WERE JOHN Q. CITIZEN CALLS IN. IF YOU'RE JOHN Q. CITIZEN CALLING HIM WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT A DV BE EITHER SIR CATIA RE CERTIFICATION. IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY. GET TO THE RIGHT HUMAN BEING GET AN ANSWER IS THIS IS AN WHATEVER TRIED THAT IT IT CALVET. ACTUALLY I HAVE NOT DONE THAT PERSONALLY SIR. BUT I HAVE SPOKE TO DIFFERENT. VETERANS THAT ACTUALLY IT CURRENTLY WE ARE ASSISTING AND I RECOGNIZE THAT IN MY SHORT TIME AS THE NEW STATE ADVOCATE. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS THAT. THAT IS UPDATED WITH THE CURRENT LINKS AND PHONE NUMBERS A POINT OF CONTACT SO WE HAVE A FAX YOU KNOW HOW TO BECOME CERTIFIED WE HAVE A FACT SHEET ON HOW TO DO BUSINESS. WITH ARE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A LOT IT. ACTUALLY IF IF YOU ITS THE DISAFFECTION THAT BE GREAT BUT I RECOMMEND THAT YOU AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY IT CALVET. WHO'S ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF DVB EASE JUST JUST TRY TO BE AT THE V. B. E. FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND TRY TO GET AN ANSWER. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD REALLY REALLY HARD. SO. I AGREE HAVING SAID THAT I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND OF ULTIMATELY GOT A SCRAM SO OKAY. ALL RIGHT WATER. NO CONCERNS I'M JUST WOULD REITERATE -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING IN OUR CONVERSATION THE DEPARTMENT THAT THIS UNIT WOULD ALSO ASSIST AND MONITORING COMPLIANCE -- AS IT RELATES TO THIS STATE AUDITS BUT OVERALL. SIR YES SIR YES MA'AM JUST BRIEFLY I DID. I TRIED TO THINK OF THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN THIS BUT IN A MILITARY CONTEXT IT'S LIKE A FIFTEEN SIX OFFICER MAY BE DRAWN. THEY MAY BE A TANKER THEY MAY BE AN INFANTRYMAN THEY MAY BE AS SUB MARINER WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS. THEY'RE DRAWN AND TASKED WITH AN INVESTIGATION WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE TEAM. THAT SPECIALIZED TO UNDERTAKE SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS LIKE YOU MENTIONED SIR DID LIKE HOW DO WE CHECK OUR INTERNAL QUALITY AND SO FORTH. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BCP IS REALLY ABOUT IS TO GET. FOLKS RATHER THAN HAVE IT BE DONE AT HAWK. SO JUST USING THE MILITARY ANALOGY. SO IF IF ONE PRETENDS TO BE A PRIVATE IS NOT BEING PAID. THEN YOU SAY I'M PRIVATE STUFFY TRIED TO GET PAID AND YOU FIND OUT THAT. THERE'S BASICALLY. NO WAY FOR SOMEONE. THE FINANCE OFFICE PERSON IS THE FINANCE OFFICER. THEN IS RESPONSIBLE NOT JUST HELP PRIVATE SNUFFY BUT ALSO CREATE A SYSTEM SO WHEN PRIVATE SNUFFY DOESN'T GET PAID. THAT HE OR SHE CAN CALL SOMEBODY DIRECTLY AND SAY I'VE NOT BEEN PAID. VERSUS TRYING. TO YOU KNOW. GO ONLINE LARA SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET PAID. TO ANALOGY IS WITH IN THAT WORKS WITH THE ENVY TO BY THE WAY. THE REALITY IS WITH DVB EASE IF YOU SAY HEY I'D LIKE TO BE A D. V. B. E.. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THERE'S A NUMBER? AND YOU CALL IT. THEN YOU FIND OUT THAT DOESN'T WORK. OR THAT YOU SPEND MANY DAYS TRYING TO GET TO A HUMAN BEING FOR GENERALLY HELPFUL IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S A SYSTEMIC ISSUE. THAT NEEDS TO GET RESULT OF SALT LADEN VERSE RIGHT YES THINGS ARE WORKING ON YES AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT SIR THANK YOU. BUT WE ARE ONE MORE MY ITEM WE NEED. TO DISCUSS OKAY SO MOVES. CENTER DORADO YES SENATOR NIELSEN SENATOR UMBERG LET'S SEE LET'S SLOW DOWN -- LET'S LET'S TAKE IT UP HERE. OKAY WE CAN PUT IT OFF. WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE HERE SO. WHAT ARE THEY ASKING -- FOR WOULD PLAY FOUR MILLION. NINE PERMANENT POSITIONS TO SUPPORT SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER [inaudible] FIRST CYBER. OVERALL WE HAVE QUESTIONS. WELL -- LET'S SEE WHAT FINANCE IN LA -- HAVE TO SAY. I SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH IS THAT OKAY. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL THIS REALLY SHORT -- GOOD AFTERNOON OR YOU WILL GET A LITTLE [inaudible] DO. I'M IN A TECHNOLOGY DIRECTOR AND JOINING ME CHIEF DEPUTY TO YEAH CHRIS CREWS AND YOU'VE ADMINISTRATIVE OFF. A MILES BURNETT TO WE CAN GO RIGHT INTO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE B. C. PEAS THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED FOR THE SECURITY OPERATION CENTERS. AND WE JUST LEAVE IT AND MAKE IT OPEN THAT WAY. OKAY DO YOU YOU DO YEAH IT'S BASICALLY BY THE DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE STATEWIDE ENTERPRISE NETWORK AND THAT NETWORK IN THESE POSITIONS ARE ALLOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THIS DEPARTMENTAL IN TERMS OF MITIGATING MONITORING AND MANAGING EFFECTIVELY ANY SECURITY INTRUSIONS OUR VULNERABILITY SO LIKE FISCAL ALL YOU HAVE. X. AMOUNT OF RESOURCES DEVOTED TO FISCAL AND THAT'S A IDENTIFIABLE NUMBER ALSO HOLDS AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THE NINE POSITIONS WERE ASKING FOR WILL DO THE TRIAGE AND DO DILIGENCE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE WHITE NETWORK THIS CALLOUS ONE COMPONENT OF THAT NETWORK. SO THEY WOULD BE SPREADING DIVERSIFIED THROUGH THE EXISTING PROCESS. BUT THE POSITIONS ARE PHYSICALLY LOCATED AT THE SECURITY OPERATION RIGHT INTERNET IT'S IT'S PHYSICALLY PARTY CD KEYS BUDGET COST. SO IT'S NOT ALLOCATED DISPERSED TO THOSE ACTUAL UNITS IT'S ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY CENTRAL. YEAH SIR COST RECOVERY PROCESS THAT WE GET THE FUNDING FOR THE EXISTING FUNDING. OKAY YOU HAVE TO INDULGE MY IGNORANCE -- SO SO FOR EXAMPLE. JUST USING FISCAL SO THIS CALL YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF CYBERSECURITY. FUNCTION WITH RESPECT TO FISCAL RIGHT. IS THAT RIGHT. YES I I I BELIEVE I IF THEY MEET LIVE RIGHT AS A TRY SO EACH OF DEPARTMENT INCLUDING DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS A DISCOUNT HAVE THEIR OWN. RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SECURITY HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO ENTERPRISE LEVEL THE PROMINENT TECHNOLOGY DOES PROVIDE THE OVER. I'D LIKE A DECISION A LAYER UMBRELLA IF YOU WOULD TO OVERSEE WHAT THEY DO AS WELL AS MONITORING WHAT THEY DO. IN THIS PARTICULAR SONS THAT THE SECURITY OPERATION OPERATIONS CENTER IS THE CENTRAL MONITORING WHEN IT COMES TO AUTO TRAFFIC IN AND OUT AT THE STATE GOVERNMENT. THAT INCLUDES DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE SCALE WAS LIKE A TIERED APPROACH. SO THE PORTION THAT IS ALLOCATED GET THIS GAL FOR WHAT THEY DO IT'S A COST RECOVERY A PERSPECTIVE THE HOW WE COST RECOVER THE THE THE FUNDING THAT WE EXPAND ON IT BUT THE PERSONNEL. OF MANAGING THAT HERE YOU KNOW HIGHER LEVEL TIER WE SITES UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE SICK COST RECOVERY ANOTHER WOULD YOU TELL FISCAL HATE. WITNESS RIGHT WITH IT COST US A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF SERVICE RIGHT TO YOU. AND THAT'S AN IDENTIFIABLE NUMBER IS THAT RIGHT OKAY. OKAY THAT'S THAT THAT IS MY QUESTION AND IDENTIFIABLE NUMBER -- IT IS PART OF THE YEAR ENDS UP BEING PART OF YOUR BUDGET OR FISCAL ITS BUDGET. YOUR BUDGET OKAY. IT'S LIKE HAVING THE HOLDING IN A GATED COMMUNITY RATE. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL GATE THIS CALL HAVE TO IDENTIFY IT IN ORDER. TO GET A GIVE A BACK TO EACH DEPARTMENT SUCH AS HAS FOR THE GALS THE SCALE WOULD HAVE A WAY -- TO REIMBURSE US ALTHOUGH THEY DO HAVE INCLUDED IN THEIR OWN PLACE WOULD SB COULDN'T THAT'S MY QUESTION AND WILL NOT A BUDGET-AUGMENTATION FOR THEM IS JUST AN EXPENDITURE. RIGHT SO LIKE ANY OTHER EXPENDITURES AN EXPENDITURE THEY'RE GOING YOUR KERR -- FOR YOUR CORRECTIVE SURPRISES SO WE'RE A WARRANT OPPRESSORS WORK COST RECOVERY ORGANIZATION SO WE HAVE A A BUDGET RIGHT BUT WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND RAISE THAT AND REVENUE THROUGH OUR CLIENTS RIGHT SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT MAYBE THE CHAIR. ALSO WENT WE'RE GIVING A POT OF MONEY TO ONE ENTITY RIGHT FOR GIVING AND THAT ENTITY IS GOING. TO PAY YOU SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING TO PART OF THEIR BUDGET IS GOING YOU WHICH IS FINE I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE THE PROCESS AND IT WAS SUCH A LARGE PIECE OF THAT THAT THAT PRETTY BURDEN ON THEM THEY WOULD GO TO FINANCE A LOOK FOR SOME. KIND OF AUGMENTATION ON THEIR END RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] GOOD. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. A FOR NOTHING. ALL YOUR TIME OKAY ALL RIGHT WE NEED A MOTION AS YOU WALK OUT SENATOR. SO MOVED OKAY SENATOR ALSO YES CENTER NIELSEN FENDER AMBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MA'AM OKAY I THINK THIS IT. THOUGH CLOSING REMARKS. LAUGHING. ALL RIGHT I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY EVEN EVERYBODY WHO LEFT. FOR ALL YOUR SERVICES WE REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT. I DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
