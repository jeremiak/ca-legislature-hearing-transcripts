AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE EXCLUSION ACTS OUR STATE AUTHORIZES SEGREGATION OF CHINESE AMERICANS IN SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND OTHER PUBLIC FACILITIES. AS WELL AS ALLOW FOR ALIEN LAND LAWS IN ANTI MISCEGENATION LAWS TO PREVENT CHINESE AMERICANS FROM OWNING PROPERTY. THIS WAS CALIFORNIA LAW UNTIL THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL MIGHT WESTSIDE COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO MENTION IF WE DO NOT REMEMBER HISTORY WE WILL REPEAT IT.

THIS MEASURE RECOGNIZES MAY SIX TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS A HUNDRED THIRTY SIX ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT. THIS RACISM DISCRIMINATORY POLICY DENIED CHINESE PEOPLE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS. IMMIGRATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR NATION'S HISTORY. PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE COME TO AMERICA AND BROUGHT WITH THEM NEW IDEAS. AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. DIVERSITY INCLUSION ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT SETS OUR NATION APART. WOULD MAKE AND WHAT MAKES OUR NATION GREAT. THERE ARE THOSE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE US REVERT TO HARMFUL POLICIES LIKE THIS ONCE AGAIN DENYING CITIZENSHIP AND REFUGE THE PEOPLE THEY PERCEIVED AS DANGEROUS? WE MUST NEVER FORGET HOW DANGEROUS THESE POLICIES CAN BE OR HOW MUCH HARM THEY CAN CAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES. AJ ARE THIRTY SIX REMINDS US TO HONOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND TO CONDEMN ANY POLICIES. THAT SEEK TO THREATEN WHAT WE AS AMERICANS AND CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA STAND FOR. I URGE SUPPOSED BOARD FOR AJ ARE THIRTY SIX. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR THIRTY SIX. WHICH COMMEMORATES THE CRITICAL LESSONS OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT AND THE HARDSHIPS ENDORSED BY THE PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT IN THE UNITED STATES WHILE CONDEMNING THE ACTS DISTURBING PARALLELS TO APPAREL FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS IMMIGRATION POLICIES OF TODAY. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE DIVERSE FIFTY FIRST DISTRICT I AM PROUD TO REPRESENT CHINATOWN IN LOS ANGELES. I HAVE HEARD THE STORIES OF THE CHINESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHO GATHERED IN THESE COMMUNITIES TO FIND SANCTUARY. FROM THE RESENTMENT AND STRIFE THAT CAME ABOUT THE TIME OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT. DECADES LATER SOME FAMILIES STILL REMEMBER. IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO DESPITE PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT COMING TO THE U. S. AND MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS. LIKE BUILDING THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD AS WELL AS LABORING IN BUILDING BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST COAST. IMMIGRANTS FROM CHINA HAD THE GATES OF TH UNITED STATES SLAMMED SHUT IN THEIR FACES. THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT WAS PASSED IN AN ERA OF FEAR. WHERE PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT WERE LABELED AS YELLOW* WHEDON'S? DIRTY. EVEN SAYING THOSE WORDS GIVES ME. TREMENDOUS. FEELINGS ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING TODAY. ADDED TO THAT THERE WAS WIDESPREAD PARANOIA THE LED MANY IN THE U. S. TO BELIEVE THAT THE CHINESE PEOPLE WERE HERE TO TAKE OUR JOBS AND UNDERCUT OUR WAGES. SOUNDS LIKE VERY SIMILAR PARALLEL LANGUAGE OF TODAY. THERE ARE MANY DISGRACEFUL PARALLELS TO THE SENTIMENT THAT EXISTS WHICH ARE DIRECTED TO IMMIGRANTS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS MOST OF WHICH THAT HATEFUL SENTIMENT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE LATINO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY OF TODAY. THE CHINESE EXCLUSION NOT SET UP A PATTERN OF SEEN A PHOBIA IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY WERE AN ENTIRE GROUP WAS EXCLUDED FROM COMING TO THE UNITED STATES SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ETHNICITY. TRAGICALLY THIS BIGOTRY IS STILL GOING ON TODAY. WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK ANY FURTHER THAN TODAY'S HEADLINES REGARDING THE RESCINDING OF TPS THE MISGUIDED CALLS FOR A FOOLISH BORDER WALL IN THE PROPOSED MUSLIM BAND. TO. SIVA DAMAGE THAT THIS DISCRIMINATION HAS DONE AND CONTINUES TO DO SO BY DIVIDING PEOPLE FROM VARIOUS DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS ACROSS OUR STATE AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.
