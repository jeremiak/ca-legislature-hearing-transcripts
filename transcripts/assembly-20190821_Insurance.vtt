00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:10.795
DEFINES THE NORMAL INSURANCE

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:11.796
MARKET AS BOTH ADMITTED

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:13.097
CARRIERS AND SURPLUS LINES

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:14.732
CARRIERS. AND I JUST WANT TO

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.134
CLARIFY THAT JUST BECAUSE

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.769
THAT'S THE NORMAL MARKET THAT

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:19.170
DOESN'T MAKE THE FAIR PLAN THE

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:22.006
ABNORMAL MARKET. JUST WANTED TO

00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:26.844
CLARIFY THAT. IN ALSO LASTLY TO

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:27.945
INSURE QUALIFIED PROPERTY FOR

00:32:28.012 --> 00:32:28.546
WHICH BASIC PROPERTY INSURANCE

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:29.147
CANNOT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:31.883
NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET. WE'RE

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:32.884
THERE FOR YOU WE WILL WRITE

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.385
ANYWHERE IN THE STATE WE WERE

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:36.354
AS LONG AS THE PROPERTY IS IN

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:36.921
TROUBLE CONDITIONAL GOING TO

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:37.522
THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE LATER.

00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:40.291
BUT THE REASON PEOPLE DON'T

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:40.858
TEND TO KNOW ABOUT THE FAIR

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:44.362
PLAN EITHER IS BECAUSE. YOU

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:45.496
ONLY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT US WHEN

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:46.864
YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE

00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:48.299
ELSEWHERE SO THE LAST TIME THE

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.401
FAIR PLAN WAS SORT OF. YOU KNOW

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:52.503
IN THE PRESS IF YOU WILL

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:53.638
GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION WAS

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.573
AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.207
WHEN THE INSURANCE MARKET KINDA

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.142
SEIZED UP SO THAT'S ABOUT THE

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.477
LAST TIME THE FAIR PLAN WAS

00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:00.478
REALLY. YOU KNOW IN THE

00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:02.213
LIMELIGHT IF YOU WILL BECAUSE

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.548
WE WERE THERE TO FILL IN THE

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:04.749
MARKETPLACE BECAUSE THERE WAS

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:07.318
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A REAL

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:08.419
DIFFICULT IN THE ENTIRE STATE

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.521
TO ATTEMPT INSURANCE. WE'RE

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:12.223
SEEING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NOW

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.191
SO AGAIN THIS IS NOW WHY THE

00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:14.592
FAIR PLAN KEEPS BUBBLING UP I'M

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.361
OCCASIONALLY ASKED IF WE

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:18.029
ADVERTISE IN THE ANSWER IS NO

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:19.664
NOBODY SHOULD KNOW ABOUT US

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:20.932
UNLESS THEY CAN'T GET INSURANCE

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.467
ELSEWHERE SO WE KINDA RUN BELOW

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:25.403
THE RADAR. I ALSO FIND MYSELF

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.738
SAYING REGULARLY THAT I WORK IN

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:29.140
OPPOSITE WORLD FOR ME SUCCESS

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.275
IS DEFINED BY A SHRINKING BOOK

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.244
OF BUSINESS FOR ME WHEN NOBODY

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:34.312
KNOWING ABOUT US IS A GOOD

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:37.682
THING. SO IN MANY WAYS WERE

00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:38.716
SORT OF THE OPPOSITE OF THE OF

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:40.485
THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:41.519
WERE ABSOLUTELY THERE FOR THE

00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:43.354
MARKET PLACE WHEN IT NEEDS US

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:44.422
BUT IF YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:47.258
ABOUT US THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:47.859
THAT MEANS WE HAVE A VERY VERY

00:33:47.925 --> 00:33:54.365
HEALTHY MARKET. MOVING ON THE

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:54.966
SIDE THREE. AGAINST LIVERMORE

00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:56.634
BACKGROUND. FAIR PLAN IS NOT A

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.002
STATE AGENCY I FIND THAT

00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:58.636
PEOPLE. SOMETIMES THINK THAT'S

00:33:58.703 --> 00:33:59.871
THE CASE. RUSSIA PRIVATE

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:00.471
ASSOCIATION COMPRISED OF ALL

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.539
INSURERS. LICENSE TO WRITE

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:03.441
PROPERTY INSURANCE IN

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:03.941
CALIFORNIA SO IF IT'S AN

00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:06.811
ADMITTED INSURER. IN THE STATE

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.045
OF CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE A

00:34:08.112 --> 00:34:09.013
CHOICE THEY HAVE TO BE A MEMBER

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.183
OF THE ASSOCIATION. AND WHAT

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.484
THAT MEANS HIS THOSE SAME

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:15.486
COMPANIES ARE ARE NOT OFF THE

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.321
HOOK WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:20.158
ASSESS THE INSURERS. IF WE NEED

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:22.193
MONEY TO PAY CLAIMS NOW THE

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.761
GOAL IS OF COURSE NOT TO EVER

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:25.663
GET IN THAT POSITION WE NEED TO

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.932
HAVE ACTUALLY SOUND RATES WE

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:28.533
NEED TO BE ABLE TO PAY LOSSES

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:31.302
OVER TIME. THE NORMAL INSURANCE

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.903
MARKET IS BUT BASIC AND WE'RE

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.671
BACK BY THE MARKET SO THERE

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.039
WILL NEVER BE AN OPPORTUNITY

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:38.075
WHERE THE FAIR PLAN CANNOT PAY

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:38.676
CLAIMS AND THAT'S A VERY VERY

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:42.246
GOOD POSITION TO BE IN. THERE'S

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:42.814
PUBLIC FUNDING NOR TAXPAYER

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.483
MONEY IS INVOLVED. THIS IS

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.884
SOMETHING TO THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:47.819
SURPRISED TO HEAR WERE VERY

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.687
SMALL ORGANIZATION WE HAVE LESS

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:52.757
THAN SIXTY EMPLOYEES WE ARE A

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:54.826
FULL FULL SERVICE INSURANCE

00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:56.227
COMPANY WAS LESS THAN SIXTY

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:57.862
EMPLOYEES WE DO IT ALL. WE

00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:00.731

THE CLAIMS WE AYE BY

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.536
REINSURANCE WE DO PRETTY MUCH.

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:06.537
EVERYTHING A NORMAL INSURANCE

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:07.872
MARKET AS ONLY WITH A MUCH

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.874
SMALLER STAFF WE ALSO SERVICE

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:12.376
OUR POLICIES MAILER HELP OUR

NEW BROKERS UNDERSTAND HOW TO

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:16.647
USE OUR SYSTEM AT CETERA. THE

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:17.782
GOOD THING ABOUT SUCH A SMALL

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:19.383
STAFF IS WE ALSO HAVE VERY LOW

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.285
EXPENSES WHICH WERE ABLE TO

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:22.787
PASS ALONG A RATES WE WANT TO

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.522
KEEP OUR EXPENSES DOWN. TO TRY

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:26.090
TO KEEP RATES AS LOW AS

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:27.592
POSSIBLE AND THAT'S ANOTHER

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:29.527
THING MY STAFF TENDS TO CALL ME

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:30.061
A BUDGET HAWK AND THEY'RE

00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:33.898
RIGHT. MY GOAL IS TO LET'S KEEP

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:36.033
EXPENSES DOWN AGAIN SO WE DON'T

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.534
HAVE TO PASS THAT ON. IN

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:40.771
PREMIUM. MOVING ON A PAGE FOR

00:35:40.838 --> 00:35:41.339
SO WHERE DOES THE FAIR PLAN

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:44.475
RIGHT. FAIR PLAN RIGHTS IN ANY

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:47.078
LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA SUBJECT

00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:47.645
TO VERY LIMITED UNDERWRITING

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:50.615
GUIDELINES INCLUDING. OF THE

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:51.182
HOUSE MUST BE AN INSURABLE

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:53.184
CONDITION WHAT THAT MEANS IS

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:55.753
BASICALLY NO ON REPAIR DAMAGE

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.456
IT'S A PRETTY LOW BAR SO. HOME

00:35:58.523 --> 00:35:59.090
CAN'T BE VACANT FOR MORE THAN A

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:02.093
YEAR. AGAIN NOT SOMETHING

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:03.094
WITHIN THE CONTROL THE

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.228
HOMEOWNER AND NOT ATTRACTS A

WHOLE LOT OF. LOS ACTIVITY AND

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:09.367
SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR RULES AND

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:11.068
LASTLY NO ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.637
CAN TAKE PLACE AT THE PROPERTY

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:13.437
IN YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT WE

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.240
INSPECTIONS BUT WE WON'T WRITE

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:18.009
THOSE POLICIES. FOR ALL INTENTS

AND PURPOSES WE WRITE JUST

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.013
ABOUT ANYTHING SO AGAIN WE WILL

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.180
WRITE I TELL PEOPLE THIS ALL

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:24.849
THE TIME I WILL WRITE A WOOD

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:26.717
CABIN WITH THE WOOD ROOF IN THE

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:28.886
MIDDLE OF A FOREST WITH NO FIRE

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:29.487
PROTECTION. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:32.290
THERE FOR. I WILL ALSO WRITE

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:34.125
PROPERTIES THAT AREN'T THAT

00:36:34.191 --> 00:36:35.927
EXTREME. BUT FOR WHATEVER

REASON. CAN'T GET INSURANCE

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:38.829
ELSEWHERE THAT'S OUR ROLE IN

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:40.298
THE MARKETPLACE IS TO MAKE

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.699
SURE. THAT THE PROPERTY

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:42.934
INSURANCE MARKET IS STABLE THAT

INSURANCE WE ARE THERE FOR THEM.

00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:48.973
SO THERE WILL NEVER BE A

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.874
SITUATION WHERE A POLICY HOLDER

00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:53.711
WHO YOU KNOW. HOUSE A HOUSE

00:36:53.778 --> 00:36:56.380

MANY OF THOSE WE FIND. AND THE

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:03.221
HOUSE HAS BEEN VACANT FOR MORE

00:37:03.287 --> 00:37:05.323

IS WE CAN DEFINITELY MAKE SURE

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:12.330
PEOPLE ARE TAKEN CARE OF. AND

00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:13.631
PROBABLY WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.600
THESE DAYS IS WE WILL ENSURE A

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:18.603
PROPERTY REGARDLESS OF ITS

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.037
EXPOSURE TO BRUSH WILD FIRE.

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:21.505
AGAIN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THERE

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:23.074
FOR. WE WILL NEVER TURN AWAY

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.109
PROPERTY BASED ON LOCATION THAT

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:26.777
IS NOT ONE OF OUR CRITERIA. WE

00:37:26.844 --> 00:37:29.213
WILL WRITE WHAT EVER. A

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.847

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.107
OF POLICIES AGAIN THAT WOULD BE

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:31.075
COUNTER TORE PURPOSE IN THE%

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:33.277
MARKETPLACE. SO WE ACTUALLY

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:35.146
HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:36.247
CONCENTRATIONS OF POLICIES IN

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:37.982
CERTAIN POCKETS OF THE STATE

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.684
BUT AGAIN I STRESS THAT'S WHAT

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.986
WE'RE THERE FOR NOW THE NORMAL

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:43.287
INSURANCE MARKET YOU KNOW THEY

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:45.022
MIGHT BE LOOKING AT SPREADING

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.724
THE RISK OUT WHICH CANDIDLY IS

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.092
A VERY SMART THING TO DO FROM A

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.027
LOS PERSPECTIVE. BUT AGAIN FROM

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:52.096
WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM WE WILL

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.098
NOT WE WILL NOT TURN ANYBODY

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.633
AWAY BECAUSE WERE WRITING TOO

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.168
MANY PROPERTIES IN THAT AREA

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:58.936
THAT WOULD NEVER OCCUR WITH US

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:01.439
AND AGAIN ON TOP OF THAT WILL

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:04.909
ALSO READ THE HIGHER RISK PROP.

00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:05.509
PROPERTIES WILL WRITE A WOULD

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:10.848
ROOF. YOU KNOW THERE A LOT OF

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:12.616
COMPANIES WON'T UNDERSTANDABLY.

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:13.417
WILL WRITE A WOULD ROOF IN THE

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:14.518
MIDDLE OF A FOREST IF NEED BE

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:15.619
AGAIN WE WRITE THE HIGH RISK WE

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:18.089
RIGHT CONCENTRATIONS. HOWEVER

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:21.425
MOVING ON TO PAGE SIX. NOW I'VE

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:21.926
TALKED A LOT ABOUT BRUSH

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:23.527
WILDFIRE BUT THE FAIR PLAN

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:24.895
HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN AND URBAN

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:27.932
WRITER OF BUSINESS IN FACT 61%

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:31.235
OF OUR BUSINESS TODAY. IS URBAN

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:34.071
BUSINESS WE WRITE HELLO IN FACT

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.874
ABOUT 80% ACTUALLY THE LESSON

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:38.642
ABOUT 75% OF OUR BUSINESS IS IT

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:43.681
IS IN LA COUNTY WE WRITE. A

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:44.648
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF URBAN

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:45.649
BUSINESS STILL THE MAJORITY OF

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:46.851
WHAT WE WRITE SO WHEN PEOPLE

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.085
HEAR ABOUT THE FAIR PLAN THEY

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.854
DON'T ALWAYS THINK THAT. BUT

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.822
THE URBAN CUSTOMER IS OUR CORE

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:55.793
CUSTOMER STILL AT THIS POINT.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.996
WE ENSURE TWO POINT 7% OF THE

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:01.465
HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:02.466
THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN HIGH AN

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.802
EXTREME WHILE FOR RISK AREAS.

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.771
WHAT THAT MEANS IS NINETY SEVEN

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:09.673
POINT 3% OF THE HOUSING STOCK

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.908
IN THOSE AREAS ARE WRITTEN BY

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:12.576
THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:13.944
THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG

00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:16.213
STATISTICS SO WE'RE THERE FOR

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.149
THE FOR THE SMALL. NUMBER OF

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.384
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY NEED US BUT

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:22.052
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE VOLUNTARY

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.654
MARKET IS STILL VERY VERY

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:24.755
ACTIVE IN THESE AREAS NOT

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:25.289
THAT'S A SIGN OF A HEALTHY

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:27.491
VOLUNTEER MARKET. NOW THAT SAYS

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:31.762
WE HAVE GROWN. TWENTY TWO

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:32.329
THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:33.364
DWELLING POLICIES IN THE LAST

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.366
TWELVE MONTHS NOW THAT'S LET ME

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:36.934
PUT THAT IN CONTEXT FOR YOU

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:38.002
SINCE TAKING OVER THE FAIR PLAN

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:40.037
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE'VE BEEN

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:41.806
STEADILY DECLINING ABOUT

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.641
ANYWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:44.275
THREE HUNDRED POLICIES A MONTH.

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:48.045
SORT OF A SLOW. SLOWED DROP OFF

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:48.813
IN THE LAST MONTH WE'VE GROWN.

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:52.583
SO. DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.450
AT THIS NUMBER THE WAY I LOOK

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:55.719
AT THIS NUMBER IS OKAY I SAW

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:56.687
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:58.422
SACRAMENTO BEE THIS MORNING AND

00:40:58.489 --> 00:40:59.723
SAID THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:00.724
THOUSAND POLICIES WERE NON

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.626
RENEWED BY THE INSURANCE

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:03.227
INDUSTRY UNIFORMLY PICKING UP

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:04.728
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND OF THOSE.

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.163
THAT MEANS WE STILL VERY

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.730
HEALTHY VOLUNTARY MARKET AND

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:09.834
ALSO MEANS. THAT THE SYSTEM IS

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.936
WORKING BECAUSE THESE TWENTY

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:12.937
TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS ARE

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:15.873
COMING TO US WHEN THEY NEED US

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.708
SO AGAIN OVERALL THE SYSTEM IS

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:20.678
WORKING IF I COULD AND BY THE

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:22.079
WAY ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:23.747
HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF THE-

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:24.849
SPEAKERS OF A PLEASE GO AHEAD

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:28.085
NASCO. OR MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:29.386
UNTIL THE SPEAKERS FINISHED BUT

00:41:29.453 --> 00:41:30.487
ON THAT POINT I THINK IT'S

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:33.190
IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:34.225
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:35.993
THOUSAND OR WHATEVER THAT THREE

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:36.560
HUNDRED PLUS THOUSAND THAT'S

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:37.494
OVER A PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:39.563
CORRECT YOU KNOW I JUST SAW

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.233
THAT THE HEADLINE SO I YEAH.

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:45.269
YOU DON'T THEIR SUMMARIZING

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:47.705
ACCUMULATIVE NUMBERS OVER I

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:50.674
THINK IT WAS A FOUR YEAR PERIOD.

00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:51.876
BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T SQUARE

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:52.476
WITH THE NUMBER THAT YOU JUST

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:53.010
GAVE US FOR THE PAST YEARS

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:58.549
INCREASE. OKAY THAT POINT TAKEN

00:41:58.616 --> 00:41:59.183
AGAIN I JUST READ THE HIGH JUST

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.051
READ THE THANK YOU MISTER

00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:02.519
CHAIRMAN WELL LIKE I SAY YEAH.

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:03.053
THEY'LL BE OTHERS SPEAKERS

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.589
TALKING ON THE DATA THIS

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:06.490
MORNING AND WILL HAVE A CHANCE

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:10.961
TO. SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:11.896
I GUESS ABSOLUTELY PLEASE COULD

00:42:11.962 --> 00:42:12.496
YOU PLEASE CONTINUE THE BATON

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:13.430
SO WHAT I CAN POINT TO

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:14.465
FACTUALLY AND ACCURATELY IS

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:16.300
THAT WE'VE GROWN TWENTY TWO

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:16.934
THOUSAND AND ONE I. WANTED ONE

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:17.701
POLICIES IN LAST YEAR WELL. NOW

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.436
LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR FOR

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:21.005
THOSE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:22.439
CUSTOMERS. IT FEELS LIKE AN

00:42:22.506 --> 00:42:24.341
AVAILABILITY CRISIS. I'M NOT

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:27.011
GONNA DO MINIMIZE HOW THESE

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:28.746
PEOPLE MUST FEEL ABOUT THE

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.214
INSURANCE AVAILABILITY FOR

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:33.017
THEIR PROPERTY IT'S PROBABLY A

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:33.651
REALLY BAD FEELING BUT THE GOOD

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:37.054
NEWS IS. THAT THE VAST MAJORITY

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:38.188
OF THE CUSTOMERS WHO'VE BEEN

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:39.123
NON RENEWED BY THEIR INSURANCE

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.858
COMPANY CAM FIND INSURANCE

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:42.693
ELSEWHERE IN FACT IF YOU LOOK

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.529
THE LAST BULLET ON THE PAGE.

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:47.364
WHICH NEW BUSINESS OVER TIME

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:48.799
AND HAVE BEEN SINCE LAST

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.901
NOVEMBER YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE

00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:53.037
WE WERE EXPECTING A AN INCREASE

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:53.570
IN BUSINESS AFTER THE CAMP

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:57.207
WOLSELEY FIRES. AM THE POLICIES

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:57.808
THAT WE WROTE AS NEW BUSINESS

00:42:57.875 --> 00:43:02.813
IN NOVEMBER. ALMOST ONE OUT OF

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.414
FIVE OF THOSE POLICIES ARE NO

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:03.981
LONGER WITH US BY THE END OF

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:07.217
JULY. THAT'S A VERY STRONG

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:09.353
STATISTIC WHAT THAT TELLS ME

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.322
WHAT I TAKE FROM THE STATISTIC

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:12.323
IS THAT PEOPLE ARE PANIC BUYING

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:14.892
FROM US. AND THAT'S EXACTLY OUR

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:17.227
ROLE WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.363
GO WITHOUT INSURANCE NO MATTER

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.964
HOW LONG IF IT'S A IF IT'S A

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.332
DAY IF IT'S A WEEK OF ITS A

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:22.599
MONTH. THEY SHOULDN'T GO

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.534
WITHOUT PROPERTY INSURANCE AND

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.569
THEY ARE WELCOME TO AND THEY

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:27.304
ARE ABLE TO COME TO THE FAIR

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:30.007
PLAN AND GET INSURANCE. UNTIL

00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:30.574
SUCH TIME THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:34.278
OPPORTUNITY. OR CANDIDLY THE

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:35.813
TIME BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE TIME

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:37.281
TO SHOP AROUND AND GET

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:38.949
INSURANCE ELSEWHERE I CAN SPEAK

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:40.284
FOR THE TIME I REASON I'M I'M

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:41.218
AN INSURANCE CUSTOMER I

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:42.186
RECENTLY WENT THROUGH THIS

00:43:42.252 --> 00:43:44.355
PROCESS I. I ALSO UNDERSTAND

00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:45.723
THAT IT'S NOT SO EASY TO GO OUT

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.024
AND SHOP AROUND AND GET NEW

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:48.392
INSURANCE SO IT'S NOT A SIMPLE

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:49.693
THING TO DO NECESSARILY. BUT

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.894
AGAIN THE GOOD THING IS ALMOST

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.830
ONE IN FIVE OF OUR CUSTOMERS

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.031
HAVE MANAGED TO PLACE INSURANCE

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:55.766
OR LEAVE THE FAIR PLAN. SO

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.401
PRESUMABLY GET INSURANCE WITH

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:59.203
ANOTHER COMPANY AGAIN A VERY

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:01.705
SOLID STAT BUT ALSO IT SHOWS

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:03.107
ONCE AGAIN THE SYSTEMS WORKING

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:05.476
CUSTOMERS ARE COMING TO US WHEN

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:08.112
THEY NEED US. AND THEY LEAVE

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:08.645
WHEN THEY NO LONGER DO. SO

00:44:08.712 --> 00:44:11.915
THAT'S A GOOD THING. YEAH I

00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:12.850
WORKING OPPOSITE WORLD WE'RE

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:13.450
TRYING TO HELP COST LEAVE THE

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:15.652
FAIR PLAN. SO MOVING ON TO

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:19.356
SLIDE SEVEN. WHAT DO WE WRITE

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:19.923
WELL IN A NOT SHOW WE WRITE

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.457
WHAT THE NORMAL INSURANCE

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:21.025
MARKET WON'T. AND WHAT IS IT

00:44:21.091 --> 00:44:25.229
THEY WON'T WRITE. FIRE. SO

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:28.966
THINK OF US AS BEING ME.

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:30.667
EARTHQUAKE WRITER OF YOU KNOW

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:31.802
INSTEAD OF EARTHQUAKE WE WRITE

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:33.404
FIRE THIS IS A PERIL THAT THE

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.372
INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN SOME

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:38.776
AREAS IS HESITANT TO WRITE

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:40.010
AGAIN THAT'S OUR ROLE WE WRITE

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:42.312
A BASIC PROPERTY. PER THE YOU

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:43.914
KNOW THE PURPOSES OF THE FAIR

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.716
PLAN A BASIC INSURANCE POLICY

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:48.018
RIGHT FIRE EXTENDED COVERAGE IN

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:49.653
VMM VMM IS VANDALISM MALICIOUS

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.855
MISCHIEF EXTENDED COVERAGE

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:54.058
WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE WIND

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:54.625
AND SOME YOU KNOW SOME OTHER

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:57.327
MINOR COVERAGES BUT. OUR

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:58.862
PRIMARY PERIL WHAT WE WHAT WE

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:01.832
KNOW WHAT WE DO WHAT WE ADJUST

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:02.933
WHAT WE TAKE CARE OF CUSTOMERS

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.401
WITH DAY IN AND DAY OUT IS

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:08.405
FIRE. THAT'S OUR CORE PRODUCT.

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:09.239
WELL RIGHT THOSE BRUSH WILDFIRE

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:10.908
EXPOS POLICIES WERE RIGHT OLDER

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:11.809
HOMES THIS IS ONE OF THE

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.010
REASONS WHY WE HAVE A BIG URBAN

00:45:13.077 --> 00:45:14.878
BOOK. WE HAVE A LOT OF POLICIES

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.413
ON THE BOOK A LOT OF PROPERTIES

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.347
ON THE BOOKS THAT ARE MORE THAN

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:20.050
EIGHTY YEARS OLD THAT'S NOT

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:21.218
NECESSARILY AN ATTRACTIVE

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:22.653
PROPERTY FOR A- YOU KNOW A

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:25.722
VOLUNTARY A NORMAL INSURANCE

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:29.193
MARKET. BUT AGAIN WILL WRITE IT.

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:29.827
I WILL ALSO WRITE. PROPERTIES

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:30.794
THAT HAVE BASICALLY NO FIRE

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.696
PROTECTION I DON'T HAVE A FIRE

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:34.731
DEPARTMENT WITHIN FIVE MILES OF

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:37.167
THEIR HOME. THERE'S NO FIRE

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:37.734
RESPONSE ABSOLUTELY WE WILL

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:40.604
WRITE THEM. AND WE'RE NOT WE

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:42.139
HAVE A LOT OF POLICIES WE WRITE

00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:43.340
A LOT OF PROPERTIES AT STILL

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:45.476
HAVE NOT BEEN TO WIRING NOT AN

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.911
ATTRACTIVE ABSOLUTELY NOT

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:50.013
ATTRACTIVE RISK FOR A VOLUNTARY

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:50.614
WRITER. BUT AGAIN WE FILL THE

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:53.750
NEED. TO GIVE THOSE FOLKS

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:54.384
INSURANCE SO WE WILL WRITE KNOB

00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:59.022
AND TUBE WIRING. SO MOVING ON

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.224
TO PAY DATE SO WHAT DOES THE

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.126
NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET RIGHT

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:03.026
WELL VIS A VIS THE POLICIES

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:06.063
THAT WE WRITE. OF THE NORMAL

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:06.597
INSURANCE MARKET WRITES A

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:08.966
DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION POLICY.

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.767
NOW WHAT THAT TYPICALLY LOOKS

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.603
LIKE IS A COMPANY WILL TAKE

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.638
THEIR HOMEOWNER'S POLICY AND

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:16.106
ADD AN ENDORSEMENT TO IT NOT

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:17.341
ENDORSEMENT SOMETIMES SAYS

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.042
SOMETHING LIKE THIS POLICY

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:21.578
COVERS EVERYTHING EXCEPT WHAT

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:24.014
THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT TO COULD BE

00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:24.648
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE OF THAT IS

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:25.616
THAT I'VE SEEN LANGUAGE AS

00:46:25.682 --> 00:46:27.284
SIMPLE AS THAT. I'VE SEEN

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:28.185
LANGUAGE THAT TALKS A LITTLE

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:29.786
BIT MORE ABOUT WE EXCLUDE FIRED

00:46:29.853 --> 00:46:31.555
WEEKS WITH EXTENDED COVERAGE WE

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.157
EXCLUDE VANDALISM UNLESS AS MR

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.758
SUMMER MORE COMPREHENSIVE

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:35.993
SUMMER OTHERS BUT AT THE END OF

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:36.827
THE DAY THEY ALL MEAN THE SAME

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:39.730
THING. THEY'LL COVER.

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:40.330
EVERYTHING ELSE OF HOMEOWNERS

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:46.537
POLICY. COVERS EXCEPT FOR THE

00:46:46.603 --> 00:46:47.104
FIRE BECAUSE THE FIRE PIECE.

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:49.439
THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY HIGH

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:50.674
RISK IN CERTAIN AREAS AGAIN. I

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:51.608
KEEP STRESSING THIS POINT BUT

00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:52.676
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR WE

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.845
RIGHT THE FIRE PIECE THIS IS

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:55.345
WHAT THE MARKET DOESN'T

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:58.282
NECESSARILY ONE RIGHT. NOW IT'S

00:46:58.348 --> 00:46:59.516
A REALLY GOOD THING THAT WE

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:00.584
HAVE SO MANY COMPANIES WHO

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:02.186
RIGHT DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:03.554
POLICIES BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.154
HAVE THIS MUCH COMPETITION YOU

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.689
END UP WITH PRICE COMPETITION.

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:06.223
SO THESE COMPANIES ARE OUT

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:09.259
THERE. THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:10.994
THEIR MULTI LINE CUSTOMER THEY

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:11.862
DON'T WANNA LOSE THE CUSTOMER

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:13.897
WHO HAS THEIR THREE HOT THREE

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:16.633
AUTOS THEIR HOME THEIR UMBRELLA

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.868
POLICY THEIR LIFE POLICY THEY

00:47:17.935 --> 00:47:18.902
DON'T WANT TO MISTER LOSE THAT

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:20.137
CUSTOMER. SO THOUGH RIGHT A

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:21.605
DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION POLICY

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.074
ALONGSIDE A FAIR PLAN POLICY

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:25.142
AND THEY CAN KEEP THAT CUSTOMER

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:26.944
AND WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.445
THAT. IS THAT CUSTOMER GETS TO

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:29.580
KEEP THEIR AUTO HOME DISCOUNT

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:31.848
WHICH IS IT IN MANY IN MOST

00:47:31.915 --> 00:47:33.116
CASES IS A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:35.219
FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS. WHAT KEEPS

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:37.588
THE RELATIONSHIP INTACT BECAUSE

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:38.055
THEY'RE STILL COVERING

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:39.656
EVERYTHING THAT THEY- ARE

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:41.592
WILLING TO COVER NAMELY NOT

00:47:41.658 --> 00:47:44.161
FIRE. AND THE CUSTOMER

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:45.562
MAINTAINS THEIR MULTI LINE

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:47.231
DISCOUNT SO THIS IS A REALLY

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:48.065
GOOD THING AND THAT. I ACTUALLY

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.399
WORK VERY CLOSE IN FACT LAST

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:51.068
WEEK I WORK WITH A VERY LARGE

WITH THEM AND GIVING THEM IDEAS

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.713
ON HOW TO STRUCTURE THEIR

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:04.548
POLICY THINGS TO CONSIDER

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.717
THINGS THINGS HELP WHAT THE

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:10.053
SIZE OF THE MARKET MIGHT BE

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.687

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:21.658
ENCOURAGE THEM. TO THINK

00:49:21.725 --> 00:49:24.227
OUTSIDE THE BOX AND IT'S

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:25.562
SEVERAL OF THESE COMPANIES THAT

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.763
WRITE D. I. C.'S I'VE ACTUALLY

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.298
DEALT WITH SEVERAL OF THEM. MY

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:29.533
BELIEVE IN OTHER ONES GOING TO

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:30.934
BE COMING OUT WITH SOME ONE

COMPETITION IN THIS SPACE. SO I

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:40.310
KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:41.311
DISCUSSION ABOUT ASKING THE

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:41.878
FAIR PLAN TO WRITE A PACKAGE

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.814
HOMEOWNERS POLICY. AND THE

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.048
ANALOGY I WOULD DRAW IT BE LIKE

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:46.583
ASKING THE FLOOD INSURANCE.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.951
PROGRAM TO WRITE THE PACKAGE

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:49.386
HOMEOWNERS POLICY WE SPECIALIZE

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:52.456
IN FIRE. THAT'S KIND OF OUR

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:55.225
WHEEL HOUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:57.527
ASKING US TO WRITE ALL THESE

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:58.729
OTHER THINGS A THE WATER THE

00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.864
PFAFF THE LIABILITY. BELIEVE IT

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.532
OR NOT THOSE ARE COMPLETELY

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:03.567
THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:05.936
UGH. LINE OF INSURANCE IF YOU

00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:06.803
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.739
EXPERTISE WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:10.006
WE'RE NOT THE CLAIMS KNOWLEDGE

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:11.641
WE DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEMS WE

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:13.210
DON'T THERE'S- WOULD HAVE TO

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:14.544
KIND OF BUILD EVERYTHING FROM

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:15.512
THE GROUND UP. AND WHAT THAT

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:18.115
WOULD MEAN IS WELL OUR EXPENSES

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:20.650
WOULD GO UP OF COURSE AND SO.

00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:21.718
RATHER THAN COMPETE WITH THE

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:22.686
VOLUNTARY MARKET WHICH IS

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:25.288
AGAIN. PER THE YOU KNW THE FOR

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:26.890
PURPOSES OF THE FAIR PLAN TO

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.525
MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:29.826
VOLUNTARY MARKET. SO I DO WANT

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.995
TO COMPETE WITH THEM. SO I SEE

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:34.364
MY ROLE IS BEING GETTING THE

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:36.733
VOLUNTARY MARKET TO WRITE MORE

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.667
OF THESE DE I SEE POLICIES AND

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:39.736
CREATE EVEN MORE COMPETITION.

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:41.438
BETWEEN THOSE COMPANIES.

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.206
RECENTLY I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:44.574
TO CONSIDER WRITING A

00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:46.910

FOR SO LON THAT IT'S HARD

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:50.433
CODED INTO MANY PARTS OF OUR

THAT'S PROBABLY TO SOME PEOPLE

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:07.851
SOUNDS LIKE A LONG WAY OUT

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:09.686
CANDIDLY I'D LIKE NOTHING

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:10.253
BETTER TO HAVE THEM TO HAVE

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.255
THAT AVAILABLE. YESTERDAY THE

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:14.090
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS A FOUR

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:15.325
ONE EFFECTIVE DATE MEANS

00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:16.927
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE LOCKED

00:53:16.993 --> 00:53:19.162
DOWN. BY FEBRUARY FIRST BECAUSE

THERE'S A MARKET NEED FOR THIS.

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.413
HOLD UP ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT BE

00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:38.014
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IT

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:39.783

RATHER THAT WHEN THAT BECOMES A

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:56.406
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE NOBODY

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:59.909
ELSE. WILLING TO WRITE A POLICY

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:02.478
ANYA AND FAIR IS THE ONLY IS

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.547
THE MEAL INSURER OF LAST RESORT

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:05.815
WHICH IS AS YOU SAID IS YOUR

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:08.818
PURPOSE. PEOPLE GET THE INCH

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:10.086
THAT PLAN BUT THEN THEY

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:11.754
ABSOLUTELY NEED TO GET

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:13.590
ADDITIONAL INSURANCE AND SO

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.325
THEY GO OUT FOR A D. I. C. OR

00:58:15.391 --> 00:58:16.459
SUPPLEMENTAL AND FROM WHAT I'M

00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:19.495
HEARING THAT IS REALLY WHAT. IS

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:22.799
THE HUGE EXPENSE FOR PEOPLE.

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:23.399
VERY IN DIFFERENT DEGREES BUT

00:58:23.466 --> 00:58:26.202
I'M HERE MORE LIKE MAYBE ABOUT

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:26.769
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.137
FAIR PLAN YOU KNOW BASIC PLAN

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:31.441
BUT THEN. WHAT COULD GET THEM

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:34.077
UP TO A TOTAL MAYBE NINE

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:34.677
THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:37.680
IS THE D. IC PLAN. AND SO I

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:38.214
THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE

00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:41.684
GETTING SOME OF THIS. THE PUSH

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:42.452
BACK AND PEOPLE ARE SAME WAY

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.821
WILL MAYBE. COULD FAIR PLAN

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:47.423
ACTUALLY MAYBE. THROUGH A BY UP

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.292
NOT JUST. FOR THE SAME PRICE

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:50.960
BUT MAY FOR BUYING UP ON THE

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:53.730
EXISTING BASIC PLAN.

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:54.330
INCORPORATE IN SOME OF THESE

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:55.298
OTHER METRICS AND WE'RE GOING

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:57.433
TO HEAR FROM SOME. OTHER

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.334
WITNESSES LATER THIS MORNING ON

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.570
THAT IDEA BUT I MEAN I HEARD

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:02.138
YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:02.772
THAT HEY THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:06.409
WERE. GEARED UP TO DO. BUT IT

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:07.043
JUST SOUNDS LIKE THAT OUT THERE

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:10.613
IN THE MARKET. IS NOT MAYBE

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:11.214
THERE ARE THERE ARE PLANS BUT

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:14.717
ARE THEY AFFORDABLE. YOU KNOW

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.185
WITHIN REASONABLE REACH OF

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:18.521
PEOPLE YOU KNOW LIVING IN SOME

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:19.389
OF THESE AREAS SURE AND THAT'S

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:22.358
AN AND- AFFORDABILITY IS A VERY

00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:23.993
REAL CONCERN I'M SORRY TO HEAR

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.428
THAT DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:29.299
POLICIES ARE ABOUT MUCH. WHAT I

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:31.034
WOULD SAY IS THERE IS A PRETTY

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.368
HEALTHY MARKET FOR DISTANT

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:33.670
DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.239
YOU KNOW I PUT ON. ON THE SLIDE

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:37.240
OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:38.775
LISTED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.843
INSURANCE WEBSITE OF COMPANIES

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.844
THAT CURRENTLY RIGHT A

00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:43.479
DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS

00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:44.080
POLICY. THE GOOD THING ABOUT

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:46.916
COMPETITION IS. YOU CAN USUALLY

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:48.151
SHOP AROUND AND GET A BETTER

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:50.086
PRICE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:52.755
ANYBODY SEEN PRICES LIKE THAT.

00:59:52.822 --> 00:59:54.357
TO SHOPAROUND BECAUSE IT'S NOT

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:56.492
THE FIRE PIECE THAT WHAT I'M

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:57.393
HEARING FROM IF I UNDERSTOOD

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:58.227
CORRECTLYIT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:59:58.294 --> 00:59:59.996
THE FAIR PLAN OF THE FIRE PIECE

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.631
THAT'S THAT'S DRIVING UP THE

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:02.165
TOTAL COSTS BUT IT'S THE

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.567
DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION. COST

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:05.134
AND AGAIN I WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.570
THOSE CUSTOMERS TO SHOP AROUND.

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:08.805
FOR THE FAIR PLAN TO OFFER

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:11.207
SOMETHING LIKE THAT I CAN'T SAY

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.475
THAT WOULD BE ANY LESS AGAIN

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.510
KEEPING IN MIND. WHO WE ARE WE

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.112
TAKE LIKE THE HIGHEST RISK

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.814
POLICIES AND IN THEORY WE'D

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.149
PROBABLY BE MORE EXPENSIVE. AND

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:24.487
SO. NOT TO MENTION WE'D WE

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:25.054
WOULD ENCOURAGE SIGNIFICAN

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:25.888
EXPENSES JUST TO GET TO THAT

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:26.990
POINT AND THEN WE HAVE TO HIRE

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:27.757
PEOPLE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:29.525
TO HANDLE A WATER CLAIM I MEAN.

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.694
ALL ALL JOKING ASIDE. WE DON'T

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:32.962
HANDLE WATER CLAIMS WE DON'T

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.063
HANDLE THE CLAIMS WE DON'T

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.398
HANDLE LIABILITY CLAIMS AND SO

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:38.201
WE'RE COMPLETELY LACKING ANY OF

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:39.302
THAT INFORMATION WHERE IS THE

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:41.437
VOLUNTARY MARKET. THAT'S THE

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.206
BEAUTY OF COMPETITION THEIR

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.807
NUMBER COMPANIES OUT THERE BOTH

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:47.810
SURPLUS LINES MANY SURPLUS

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:48.378
LINES COMPANIES IN FACT I'VE

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:48.978
BEEN WORKING WITH THE SURPLUS

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.814
LINES MARKET. OF THE PRICES ARE

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.416
ALL ACROSS THE BOARD SO THE

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.351
REALLY WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:55.852
YOUR CUSTARD YOUR YOUR

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.086
CONSTITUENTS TO DO A SHOP

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.522
AROUND. BECAUSE THOSE ARE

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:01.491
REALLY HIGH PRICES AND I FIND

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:04.761
THAT. SURPRISING AND I BUT

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:05.328
THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER FOR

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:10.266
THEM OUT THERE. MAYBE JUST AS A

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.601

DOES IS SHOPPERS AND SO HILL

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:17.874
MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE US SOME MORE

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.576
INFORMATION ON THAT BUT WOULD

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:21.744
WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE I MEAN

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:23.780
YOU YOU YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW THIS

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:24.814
VERY WELL BUT I MEAN IS THERE A

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:27.450
REFORM OUT THERE. THAT MIGHT

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.218
HELP THIS KIND OF SLIVER OF

01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:30.353
CUSTOMERS THAT WERE AT THAT I

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.954
THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.356
WHETHER IT WHETHER RUNNING INTO

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:35.391
THIS PROBLEM IS THERE REFORM

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:36.692
OUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:38.528
CAN BE DONE EVEN TO THE

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:42.131
DEPARTMENT OR LEGISLATION OR

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:42.765
OTHERWISE. THAT MIGHT HELP THAT

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:47.870
SITUATION. I THINK THAT TO I'D

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:48.371
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:48.938
NECESSARILY REFORM BUT I'M

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:50.606
PLANNING TO CONTINUE MY

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.275
DRUMBEAT WITH THE VOLUNTARY

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.143
MARKET TO ASK MORE AND MORE

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.511
COMPANIES TO WRITE DIFFERENCE

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:56.012
IN CONDITIONS POLICIES I

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.548
MENTION I HAD A MEETING LAST

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.450
WEEK WITH A REALLY LARGE

INSURANCE COMPANY. AND THE YOU

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:04.387
KNOW I. PUSHED ON THEM THEY

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:06.255
CAME BACK THEIR ENQUIRING I

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.790
THINK THE MORE COMPANIES WE CAN

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.025
GET TO WRITE THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:10.526
CONDITION THE MORE COMPETITION

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:11.894
THERE IS AND OF COURSE AS I

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.062
MENTIONED BEFORE YOU KNOW I

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.330
WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.832
SURPLUS LINES MARKET. AND

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.667
PERHAPS QUESTION I CAN HAVE A

EVEN MORE IN THAT IN THAT

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.271
REGARD I THINK COMPETITION IS

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:23.673
REALLY THE BEST THING FOR THESE

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:28.444

AND THE BIGGEST PART OF THE

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.216
PREMIUM REALLY IN THEORY SHOULD

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:37.353
BE ON THE FIRE SO. WHAT I WOULD

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:37.987
SAY THAT IS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.055
MAKING A LOT OF MONEY ON THOSE

AGAIN I WOULD SAY COMPETITION

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.129

CARRIERS TO BE PRIMA FACIA

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:17.587
EVIDENCE BUT A DILIGENT SEARCH

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:20.122
HAS TAKEN PLACE. IN SOME

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.190
INSTANCES ADMITTED INSURERS

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:22.625
WILL MAKE A BUSINESS DECISION

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.493
NOT TO COVER A PARTICULAR RISK

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.229
OR CLASS OF RISKS THESE ARE

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:28.798
USUALLY IN CASE OF DISTRESSED

NEW COMPLEX OR HIGH CAPACITY

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:33.970
RISKS. IN THE HOMEOWNERS MARKET.

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.371
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY AN

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.340
ADMITTED CARRIER MAY REDUCES

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:39.442
INSURED CONCENTRATION FOR

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.110
INSTANCE IT MIGHT FIND THAT IT

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.478
IS TOO CONCENTRATED IN A

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.780
PARTICULAR AREA OR THE RISK

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:46.849

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:47.416
TO FORCES BEYOND ITS CONTROL

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.352
SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE. IN

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.087
THESE CASES CONSUMERS NEED

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:51.654
OPTIONS OR THEY WILL BE LEFT

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:52.788

THEY NEED. THEY CAN PROCURE

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:55.224
THAT COVERAGE EITHER THROUGH

OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF RISKS

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.233
THAT GO INTO SURPLUS LINES ARE

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.469

COMPANIES OUT THERE ARE VERY

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.963
VERY CLOSELY WATCHING WHAT'S

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.799
GOING ON WITH THE FAIR PLAN

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:53.702
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE WE GOT

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:54.336
THIRTY TWO MILLION I BELIEVE IN

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:54.937
CAPITAL WHICH IS NOT A WHOLE

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:57.306
LOT OF MONEY. LET ME BE REALLY

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.009
CLEAR SO WE ARE. AT RISK OF

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:00.876
DOING AN ASSESSMENT SO WHAT

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:01.477
DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE MEMBER

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:04.213
COMPANIES. THAT MEANS. THEY

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.414
CARE A LOT ABOUT THEIR

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:07.483
ASSESSMENT POTENTIAL. RIGHT

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:08.951
THEY DON'T WANT THE FAIR PLAN

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:10.186
TO GO OUT THERE AND SAY. HEY

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.354
COUGH UP. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:13.556
DOLLARS IN THE WAY THAT STOOD

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:15.124
UP AS IT'S DONE BY MARKET

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:17.393
SHARE. SO IF A COMPANY RIGHTS

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:18.928
10% OF THE PREMIUMS IN THE

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:21.530
STATE. FOR HOMEOWNERS. THAT

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.766
MEANS THEY HAVE TO COUGH UP 10%

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.000
OF WHATEVER THE ASSESSMENT

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:27.136
AMOUNT IT IS. SO WHY ARE THE

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.370
RIGHT OUT CREDIT SO IMPORTANT

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.406
WELL TODAY. THE RIGHT UP

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:32.908
CREDITS ARE LIMITED TO A VERY

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.710
VERY SMALL AREA MOSTLY IN LA

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:37.112
COUNTY. THE CURRENT DEFINITION

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.214
IN THE INSURANCE CODE IS THE I

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.683
SO BRUSH WILDFIRE AREAS WHICH

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:41.784
IS AGAIN I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:43.819
TINY LITTLE AREAS. AND THAT

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.454
HASN'T CHANGED IN DECADES THE

01:08:45.521 --> 01:08:46.355
DEFINITION OF THAT HAS NOT

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:48.591
CHANGED IN DECADES. I BELIEVE

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:51.026
CHAIRMAN DALY HAS HAS SOME

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:53.929
LANGUAGE TO. INCREASE THAT. SO

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:55.798
THAT COMPANIES WILL HAVE THE

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:59.235
INCENTIVE. TO RIDE IN AREAS

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.637
THAT ARE HIGH OR VERY HIGH.

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:02.471
BRUSH WILDFIRE EXPOS PER

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:03.806
CALIFORNIA NOW WHY IS THAT

01:09:03.873 --> 01:09:05.674
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A ONE

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:06.675
FOR ONE OFFSET IF A COMPANY

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:09.111
RIGHTS A DOLLAR PREMIUM IN AN

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.713
AREA THAT'S CONSIDERED A RIGHT

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:13.015
OUT CREDIT AREA. THAT REDUCES

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.183
THEIR MARKET SHARE BY THE SAME

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.151
DOLLAR. SO WHAT IS THIS

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:17.286
ACCOMPLISH WELL WHAT IT DOES IS

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:19.421
IT PUTS A CHECK IN THE POSITIVE

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.957
COLUMN FOR A COMPANY TO WRITE.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.792
A POLICY IN AN AREA THAT'S

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.160
CONSIDERED HIGH IN VERY HIGH

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:28.197
BECAUSE THEY GET THE OFFSET. ON

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:29.565
THE BACKEND FOR POTENTIAL

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:31.600
ASSESSMENT. SO IF A COMPANY

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.168
LET'S SAY THEY HAVE A 10%

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:35.070
MARKET SHARE IN THE STATE TODAY

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:35.671
THEY WRITE 10% OF THE PREMIUMS

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:38.574
AND HOMEOWNERS TODAY. IF THEY

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:40.543
END UP WRITING A FULL 1% OF THE

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.777
PREMIUMS IN THESE AREAS THEY

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.212
CAN REDUCE THEIR POTENTIAL

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.681
EXPOSURE BY A FULL PERCENT AND

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:46.715
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:50.119
MONEY SO. THE REASON I'M

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:50.686
SUPPORTING THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:53.322
TERM DALY HOUSES BECAUSE- IT

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:55.524
PROVIDES INCENTIVE. TO THE

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:57.960
VOLUNTARY MARKET TO WRITE

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.929
POLICIES IN THOSE AREAS AGAIN

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:02.131
BECAUSE THEY WANT THAT OFFSET.

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:03.399
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SON

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.834
TODAY. AGAIN ALL WE'RE LOOKING

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:07.002
TO DO ARE ALL ALL I'M

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:08.070
SUPPORTING IS AN IS AN

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.506
EXPANSION OF THE AREAS FOR

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:11.373
WHICH COMPANIES CAN GET

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.642
CREDITS. BECAUSE BEING ON THE

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.844
RECEIVING END OF A YOU KNOW

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.680
DOING THE MATH ON A ON AN

01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:18.747
ANNUAL BASIS COMPANIES CARE A

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:20.683
LOT ABOUT THIS. AND THEY WILL

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:22.084
CARE EVEN MORE IF THEY HAVE

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.719
MORE OPPORTUNITY TO GET RIGHT

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:25.254
OUT CREDIT SO I WANTED TO JUST

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:26.922
I MANAGE TO COMPLETELY SKIP

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.357
THAT BUT I JUST WANTED TO

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:29.858
SUPPORT. OF THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:10:29.925 --> 01:10:30.859
CHAIRMAN DALY HAS GOING THIS

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:32.494
AFTERNOON BECAUSE I BELIEVE.

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.096
AGAIN IT'LL PUT A CHECK IN THE

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.532
POSITIVE COLUMN FOR INSURANCE

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:37.533
COMPANIES TO WANT TO WRITE IN

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.635

THREE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE.

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:11.073
WE WOULD WISH THAT THAT LIMIT

WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE SOONER

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:16.578
AND I UNDERSTAND THE- THAT SHE

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:19.381
PRESENTED REASONS WHY IT CAN'T.

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:21.416

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:25.087
CAN MOVE UP THAT APRIL DATE.

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:27.656
SHE ALSO DISCUSS AN ISSUE THAT

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.091

BETTER COVERAGE PACKAGE IS LONG

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:48.577
OVERDUE FOR URBAN POLICY

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.712

MAJORITY OF FAIR PLAN BUSINESS.

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.017
AND IT IS CRITICAL AS MORE

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.752
CALIFORNIANS FROM RURAL

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.320

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.223
THE FAIR PLAN FOR COVERAGE. I

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.557
UNDERSTAND THE REASONS THAT

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:05.260
WERE PROVIDED BY WHY THAT MIGHT

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.628
NOT BE A GREAT IDEA FOR THE

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:09.231
FAIR PLAN. BUT I WANT TO MAKE

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:10.332
IT CLEAR THAT PURCHASING

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:13.936
SEPARATE POLICIES. EACH ONE

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.170

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:18.073
LOAD A SEPARATE COMMISSION. AND

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.841
ALL OF THAT COMBINED WITH WITH

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.176
WHAT IS A VERY EXPENSIVE FIRE

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:25.147
POLICY. MAKES IT A VERY

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.249
EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION TO PUT

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.184

THE PEOPLE IN THE RURAL AREAS

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:45.667
THAT ARE HAVING YOU KNOW THIS

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:48.003
ISSUE MOVING THE FAIR PLAN. SO

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.505
IT WOULD BE SO EXPENSIVE TO PUT

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:51.873
TOGETHER TO IN THREE POLICIES

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.275
TO ACCOMPLISH. WHAT AN AGE OF

THREE PROVIDES. DATA SHOWS

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:59.214
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A 49%

INCREASE IN SURPLUS LINES

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:01.583

TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO

FOUR YEARS SURPLUS LINES

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:11.193

FIVE BY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:15.063
POLICIES FOR THOSE IN A STATE

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.566

01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:18.934
INCREASE IN SURPLUS LINES

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:22.437
WRITINGS IN THAT AREA. THE

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:24.006
GROWTH IN THESE ALTERNATIVE

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:25.907
MARKETS THE FAIR PLAN AND STE

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.577
AND THE SURPLUS LINES REFLECTS

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:30.112
THE TREND IN THE VOLUNTARY

AREAS OF HIGH FIRE RISK ARE ON

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:37.419
THE INCREASE. AND I WANT TO

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.488
STRESS THAT THIS NEW DATA THE

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:40.455
DATA THE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.557

INSURERS RETRENCHING FURTHER IS

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:56.171
WHAT WE BELIEVE AS FIRES OF THE

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:59.408
CAMP CAR BALLSY HILL FIRES.

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.176

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:07.849
NEAR THE END OF THE YEAR THE

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:10.018
FULL EFFECTS OF THOSE FIRES ON

PROBABLY AREN'T IN THE DATE.

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:17.025
THIS EXPECTATION IS CONSISTENT

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:18.493
WITH CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:28.670
OF INSURANCE. NON RENEWAL IS

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:31.073
GENERALLY EXPECTED TO GET WORSE

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:32.774
IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:35.043

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.998
FIRE RISK SAID THERE ARE MORE

01:18:57.065 --> 01:19:00.235
NON RENEWALS AHEAD. NOW WE

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:01.937
UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE STATE

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.004
WITH OVER EIGHT MILLION

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:05.674
INSERTED RESIDENCES THESE

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.241
NUMBERS MAY SEEM EVENTS AND

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:09.611
SIGNIFICANT. BUT AGAIN I HOPE

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:11.613
EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES TO THE

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.448
INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:13.982
WHERE THE NON RENEWALS ARE

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:17.419
TAKING PLACE. IT CREATES BOTH

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.921
PERSONAL AND REGIONAL CRISES

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:21.356
AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.024
PROPERTY VALUES AND THOSE

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:26.661
COMMUNITIES CAN BE TROUBLING.

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.330
AND JUST SO IT'S JUST NOT MY

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.165

INSURANCE FROM ANY KERRIER. IF

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.631
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T DO SOMETHING

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.366
ABOUT THIS PROPERTY VALUES WILL

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.801
DROP TAXES WILL GO DOWN AND

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.136
LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.271
DEPENDENT UPON THE PROPERTY

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:14.075
TAXES WILL BE IN TROUBLE. IF

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:16.244
YOU ARE A NEIGHBOR OF. EMPIRE

NOT REDUCING FUEL LOADS ON YOUR

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:20.549
SHARED BOUNDARY WHAT CAN A

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:28.323
HOMEOWNER DO. THE WE WORK OUR

OUR INSURANCE COMPANY DROP THIS

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:42.637
ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WE

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:43.939
WERE ABLE TO GET NEW INSURANCE

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:46.741
THE COST US SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.843
DOLLARS LAST YEAR. IT WENT UP

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:50.812
TO OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:53.281
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS IT IS

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:59.654
OUTRAGEOUS. AND ONE MORE. SO

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.056
THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS RIGHT

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:02.657
THESE IF YOU GO OUT IN THE

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:04.392
COMMUNITIES THIS IS WHAT YOU

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:06.261
HEAR. NOW THIS JUST SEEM LIKE

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:08.096
BIG NUMBERS BUT WHEN YOU GET

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:10.565
DOWN TO INDIVIDUAL AREAS IT'S

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:11.967
THERE'S A CONCENTRATION OF

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:14.135
PEOPLE IN THIS SITUATION.

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:15.470
MAKING THEIR INSURANCE ON

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:18.073
AFFORDABLE THEIR HOME ON

01:21:18.139 --> 01:21:18.607
AFFORDABLE. THEIR HOME AND

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:24.045
SELLABLE. BUT NON RENEWALS ARE

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:26.081
ONLY A PART OF THE STORY.

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:28.283
INSERTS FILINGS FOR PREMIUM

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.817
HIKES ARE COMING IN RECORD

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:32.120
NUMBERS. IN TWO THOUSAND

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:35.190
FIFTEEN WE RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE.

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:37.058
OF FILINGS FOR RATE INCREASES

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:37.859
FOR HOMEOWNERS POLICIES TWENTY

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:40.629
FIVE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:43.865
IT WAS THIRTY FOUR. IN TWO

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:47.702
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT WAS FIFTY.

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:48.670
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT WAS

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.506
SIXTY NINE. AND JUST THROUGH

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:53.275
JULY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:56.144
WERE ALREADY AT SIXTY THREE. WE

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:57.612
REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT MANY IN

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.814
SIR GROUPS WRITING HOMEOWNERS

01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:01.516
INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA SO WHAT

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.418
THAT TELLS YOU IS THE SAME

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:05.453
INSERTS ARE COMING IN FOR

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.822
MULTIPLE RATE INCREASES SO WITH

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:10.659
LAYERING ONE ON TOP OF THE NEXT.

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:12.294
IN THE BOOK OF EACH OF THOSE

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.330
RATE INCREASES CAN FALL HEAVILY

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:16.931
ON A SMALL SUBSET OF THAT

01:22:16.998 --> 01:22:19.934
INSURERS RISK POPULATION. SAN

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.736
FELIPE DOES NOT HI WELL FIRE

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.972
AREAS. SO WHILE YOU LOOK AT A

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:26.174
RATE OF RATE FILING LOG IT SAYS

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:28.009
THAT COMPANIES ARE COMING IN

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:30.445
FOR A 7% INCREASE. THAT'S

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:32.614
TALKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF AN

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:33.214
AVERAGE ACROSS THE WHOLE BOOK

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.817
OF BUSINESS. OFTENTIMES WHAT IT

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.252
REALLY MEANS IS PEOPLE IN THE

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:38.753
URBAN AREA ARE GETTING NO

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.922
INCREASE. AND THE PEOPLE IN THE

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.957
HIGH RISK AREAS BECAUSE IT'S A

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:45.093
SMALL SEGMENT OF THE BOOK. ARE

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.162
GETTING DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:48.730
MASSIVE INCREASES 50% AND MORE

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:53.868
FREQUENTLY. AND WE UNDERSTAND

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:55.503
THE SERVICE ARE REACTING TO

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.205
POSSIBLY THE WORST CALIFORNIA

01:22:57.272 --> 01:23:00.141
HOMERS LOSS RATIOS OF ALL TIME.

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:03.511
TWO HUNDRED AND 1% IN TWO

01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:04.079
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A HUNDRED

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:04.579
AND 70% IN TWO THOUSAND

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.415
EIGHTEEN. THUS FAR THE

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.150
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN APPROVING

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:10.352
MUCH GREATER THAN 90% OF THE

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:13.488
REQUESTED INCREASES. AS

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:15.557
INSURERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:16.157
THE REQUEST HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:20.095
SOUND. WITH THESE INCREASES

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:22.897
INSERTS WILL TAKE IN HUNDREDS

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:23.598
OF MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:26.134
DOLLARS EACH YEAR IN THE YEARS

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.736
AHEAD IN ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:32.240
WILDFIRES. BUT COMMISSIONER

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.376
LARA AND THE DEPARTMENT ASKS

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:34.976
WHAT ABOUT THE HOMEOWNERS WHO

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.211
HAVE LIVED IN THESE.

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:39.914
COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES.

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:41.483
COVERAGE THAT WAS READILY

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:44.552
AVAILABLE FOR MANY YEARS AND

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:45.019
PREMIUMS THAT WERE NOT

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:47.288
SIGNIFICANTLY OUT OF LINE.

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:47.889
URBAN PRICES HAVE NOW FLIPPED

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:52.260
ON THEM. THEIR SITUATION TURNED

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.863
UPSIDE DOWN IN JUST A VERY FEW

01:23:54.929 --> 01:24:00.769
YEARS AND THEY NEED HELP. SO MR

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:02.871
Là ALARA ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:05.039
THESE ISSUES NEED MASSIVE

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:06.941
ACTION AT MANY LEVELS TO

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:09.611
MITIGATE THE ISSUES AND PREPARE

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:10.211
FOR CLIMATE RISK AND A GROWING

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.814
STATE POPULATION. MUCH OF THIS

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.282
IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:15.884
INSURANCE INDUSTRY OR ITS

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:19.554
REGULATOR TO RESOLVE HELLO. BUT

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:20.188
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THE

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:21.723
COMMISSIONER BELIEVES CAN BE

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.158
DONE TO HELP THOSE POLICY

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:26.161
HOLDERS WHO ARE IN CRISIS. AND

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.695
HELP THOSE WHO SUFFER LOSSES

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:28.730
FROM FUTURE WILDFIRES WE NEED

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:33.034
TO ANTICIPATE. THESE ARE

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:34.302
PROPOSALS THAT THE INSURANCE

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.104
INDUSTRY SHOULD DO AND THAT

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:37.639
WILL HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT ON

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:40.475
COSTS OR LOSSES GIVEN THE SCOPE

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:44.112
OF THE CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE.

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:46.314
ONE EXAMPLE A VERY IMPORTANT

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:46.815
CHANGE THAT WOULD ASSIST

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:47.282
HOMEOWNERS THROUGHOUT

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:50.351
CALIFORNIA WOULD TO GIVE THEM A

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:51.986
MUCH EARLIER NOTICE OF NON

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:52.520
RENEWAL OF THEIR INSURANCE

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:56.724
POLICIES. PEOPLE NEED TIME TO

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.827
MITIGATE THEIR PROPERTY OR PICK

01:24:58.893 --> 01:24:59.360
TO POSSIBLY PRESERVE THEIR

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:03.465
RENEWAL. FOR HOMEOWNERS THIS

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:04.232
CAN MEAN TIME TO DO A MAJOR

01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:06.434
PROJECT TO THEMSELVES OR TO

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:07.035
HIRE SOMEONE TO DO WHAT CAN BE

01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:10.071
DIFFICULT. BUT IMPORTANT

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:11.372
PROJECT SUCH AS REMOVE TREES

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:13.475
ARE BRUSH THE NEXT AND THE NEXT

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:16.845
STRUCTURAL REPAIRS. IT MAY BE

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.313
NECESSARY TO MOVE PROPANE TANKS

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:20.248
AWAY FROM THE HOME OR REPLACE A

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:21.850
DECK WITH NON COMBUSTIBLE

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:24.552
MATERIALS OR IN CLOSE VINCE.

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.387
OLDER INDIVIDUALS IN PARTICULAR

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:26.855
MAY NEED TIME TO SEEK

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:30.492
ASSISTANCE. SOME POLICIES

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:32.227
HOLDERS MAY NEED TIME TO OBTAIN

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:34.662
LOANS OR GRANTS OR OTHER

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:38.766
ASSISTANCE WITH COSTS. A

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:39.367
HUNDRED EIGHT ONE HUNDRED AND

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:39.901
EIGHTY DAYS A NON RENEWAL

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:42.871
NOTICE. WOULD PROVIDE THE

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.539
NECESSARY TIME TO TAKE THESE

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.774
ACTIONS FOR PEOPLE AND THE

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:47.342
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:51.346
ELSEWHERE. OR AT LEAST IT WOULD

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:53.481
ALLOW TIME FOR SCARING THE

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.183
MARKET FOR THAT POSSIBLY VERY

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:58.386
ELUSIVE IT RENEWAL COVERAGE

01:25:58.453 --> 01:25:58.987
WITH AN ENTITY OTHER THAN THE

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:01.756
FAIR PLAN. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:06.327
MUCH LONGER NOTICE. HOMEOWNERS

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:08.363
AND LOCAL LEADERS ALSO HAVE A

01:26:08.429 --> 01:26:11.065
GREAT DESIRE TO HAVE A MEANS OF

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:12.400
ACHIEVING SOME CERTAINTY THAT

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:15.737
THERE IS AN AVENUE. NO MATTER

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:17.639
HOW NARROW THAT IF NAPA

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.173
NAVIGATED WOULD ALLOW A

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:19.707
HOMEOWNER TO RETAIN THEIR

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:22.510
COVERAGE. THIS COULD BE

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.245
ACHIEVED BY CREATING A

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:26.247
REQUIREMENT THAT INSURERS WILL

01:26:26.314 --> 01:26:28.383
OFFER COVERAGE TO HOMEOWNERS

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:29.984
WHO MEET COMPREHENSIVE AND

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.619
EFFECTIVE HOME HARDENING

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:34.389
CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS. THIS

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.957
REQUIREMENT COULD ALLOW FOR

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:36.758
EXCEPTIONS FOR OTHER

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.960
CONSIDERATIONS OF RISK AND BE

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.728
FLEXIBLE TO ACCOUNT FOR AN

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:41.195
ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:45.867
CONDITIONS. IT WOULD TAKE TIME

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:47.068
FOR THIS MITIGATED POPULATION

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:49.304
OF WRIST TO GROW. BUT OVER TIME

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.105
THESE HOMES WITHOUT A NOT ONLY

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:51.706
BE REDUCING THEIR OWN RISK OF

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:55.209
LOS. BUT DECREASING AMBER FLOW

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:56.544
IN THE CASE OF A WILDFIRE TO

01:26:56.611 --> 01:27:00.315
HELP PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:02.016
SIGNAL EMITS SHOULD BE

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.184
INCREASED TO REDUCE THE

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:05.453
LIKELIHOOD OF A POLICY HOLDER

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.189
LEFT WITHOUT COMPENSATION IF

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:08.790
THERE ENSURE SOLVE SUFFERS ON

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:12.794
INSOLVENCY. ADDITIONAL LIVING

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:14.629
EXPENSE COVERAGE SHOULD BE

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:17.398
EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:17.999
DON'T SUFFER A DIRECT LOSS TO

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:21.569
THEIR PROPERTY. BUT WHOSE HOMES

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:24.839
BECOME UNINHABITABLE FOR A TIME

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:25.440
UNTIL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:29.410
IS REPAIRED. AND I HOPE YOU'RE

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:30.945
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:32.847
PARADISE ELECTRIC LINES DOWN

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:34.582
WATER SYSTEM DOWN. NO SEWAGE

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:39.153
SYSTEM. PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES WERE

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:39.754
STILL STANDING COULD NOT LIVE

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:45.560
IN THOSE HOMES. IT WOULD BE

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:46.260
IMPORTANT TO MANY POLICY

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:48.096
HOLDERS IF THE LAW WAS ENACTED

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:50.264
TO PROHIBIT THE REDUCTION IN

01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:52.100
THE REPLACEMENT COST PAY TO A

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:54.002
CLAIMANT RESULTING FROM THE

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:57.005
DEDUCTION OF THE LAND VALUE.

01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:57.639
WHEN THE INSERT WHO HAS

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:58.840
SUFFERED A TOTAL LOSS OF THE

01:27:58.906 --> 01:28:01.976
DWELLING CHOOSES TO RE LOCATE

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:02.577
AND PURCHASE A HOME AT ANOTHER

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:05.580
LOCATION. THIS WOULD BE A

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:08.149
PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT VALUE

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:10.051
TO BOTH SENIOR CITIZENS. AND

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.153
FAMILIES WHO CAN'T GO THROUGH

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:12.620
THE ORDEAL AND TIME OF

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:16.024
REBUILDING. MR LARA HAS

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.925
SPECIFICALLY APPROACH THE

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.894
INDUSTRY TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.729
THIS MARK. SEC YOUR LANGUAGE ON

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:27.702
THE. NOVEL I THINK WE CAN GET

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:31.539
YOU LANGUAGE CERTAINLY. END OF

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:36.010
GREAT FINANCIAL. THE EMOTIONAL

BENEFIT CONSUMERS WHO HAVE

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:39.047
SUFFERED A TOTAL LOSS SHOULD BE

01:28:39.113 --> 01:28:40.882
ABLE TO OBTAIN A SUBSTANTIAL

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:41.416
PORTION OF THEIR CONTENTS

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:44.385
CLAIMS. WITHOUT GOING THROUGH

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:46.287
THE GRUELING AND UNDERSTANDABLY

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:48.289
HEART RENDING PROCESS OF THE

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:50.158
HOMEOWNER HAVING TO IDENTIFY

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:52.860
EVERY ITEM HE OR SHE OWNED.

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:54.929
IT'S PURCHASE PRICE DATE OF

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.632
PURCHASE COST AND CONDITION

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.434
JUST THE KEPT THE ACTUAL CASH

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.269
VALUE THAT'S THE DEPRECIATED

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:03.471

REPEATS WANTS THE RECEIPTS

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.442
GIVES ME WHAT'S THE ITEM IS

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:08.710
REPLACED TO RECEIVE THE

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.878
REPLACEMENT COST. WOULD LIKE

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:13.581
SOME WAIVER OF THE SIGNIFICANT

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:14.048
AMOUNT OF THE CONTENTS

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:17.652

THINKS THEY ARE UNDERINSURED

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:22.990
FOR THE REBUILD OF THEIR HOME.

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:25.159
THAT IS DUE IN LARGE PART

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:26.694
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:29.797
IT COST TO BUILD A HOME. THE

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.365
GREAT MAJORITY OF HOMEOWNERS

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:34.402
RELY ON THE ESTIMATE EVERY LOOK

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:35.002
PLACEMENT COST PROVIDED BY THE

BECAUSE. INSURERS ARE

ONE ESPECIALLY ON AN ANNUAL

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:50.084
BASIS. THAT SITUATION WOULD BE

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:51.619
IMPROVED IF THERE WAS A

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:54.055
REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY INSURED

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.723
GETS A ROUTINE ESTIMATE OF

COMMENTS FROM CONSUMERS VERY

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:24.452
BRIEFLY. THESE ARE FROM PEOPLE

WHO HAD LOSSES IN CINEMA.

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:29.257
STRUCTURAL REIMBURSEMENT WAS

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:29.824
NOT ADEQUATE TO REBUILD THE

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:33.127
HOUSE. WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.495
WHEN WE PURCHASED AND REVIEWED

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:37.565
OUR POLICY PERIODICALLY THAT WE

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:38.166

REBUILD OUR HOUSE AS IT WHAT'S-

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:41.002
WE WERE TOLD WE PAID FOR

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.905
ADDITIONAL COVERAGE. TO BE

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:45.406
CONFIDENT THAT WOULD WE WOULD

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:47.408
BE REIMBURSED AT THE RATE OF

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:48.009
BUILDING COST WHEN A DISASTER

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:53.147
OCCURRED. ANOTHER COMMENT.

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:54.282
POLICY LIMITS WOEFULLY

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:57.318

BECAUSE THE COMPANY. FALLS BACK

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:03.724
ON CALIFORNIA LOSSING

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:06.194

REGARDLESS OF GOAL STATED TO

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:14.135
AGENT NO JUST READ ONE MORE. MY

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:15.903

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:18.206
SQUARE FEET WITH A THREE CAR

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.511
THE ABSOLUTE CHEAPEST BETTER

TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:30.318
PER SQUARE FOOT WHICH WOULD

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:33.054
HAVE BEEN SIX HUNDRED AND

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:33.688
NINETY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

SHORT FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:41.362
TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.730
THAT BUILDER WENT OUT OF

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:43.931
BUSINESS BECAUSE THEIR BIDS

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:47.001
WERE TOO LOW SAID THE TWO

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:47.802
HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS A

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:01.282
SOMETHING TOTALLY WITHIN THE

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:04.318
INSURERS ABILITY TO RESOLVE. IT

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:06.020
IS SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:06.621
ALLOW TO OCCUR IN OTHER LINES

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:09.924

AND YOU KNOW THE REPRESENTATIVE

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:04.778
IT'S HERE WITH ME. SURE YEAH WE

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:08.649
HAD A CRASH COURSE IN ASSURANCE

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:10.851
AND UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY IN

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:13.821
THIS ON THIS ISSUE. FOR LAST

01:38:13.887 --> 01:38:19.193
YEAR BECAUSE IT. AS TO

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.961
TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT ARE

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:23.163
SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF THEM.

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:25.032
OF ABOUT THE RISKS THAT THEY

01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:27.167
FACE IN THE STATE. BUT I DO

01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:28.569
WANT YOU TO REMEMBER AT OF

01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:29.903
EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING AT YOU

01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:32.039
WHAT JOEL SAID. ABOUT THE RATE

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:32.906
INCREASES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:38:32.973 --> 01:38:34.808
GRANTED AND THE MONEY THAT IS

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:35.843
GOING TO BE COMING INTO THE

COFFERS OF THE INSURERS AND

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:39.713
JUST REMEMBER THAT THAT IS A- A

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.348
SOURCE OF SOME OPTIMISM HERE

01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:43.651
AND THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM.

01:38:43.717 --> 01:38:45.185
THAT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED VERY

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:46.787
THOUGHTFUL. BECAUSE THIS IS A

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.989
MARKET THAT REQUIRES BALANCE

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:51.091
STRAIGHT SO WE DON'T WANT TO GO

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:53.093
TOO FAR WITH MANDATES THAT THAT

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.195
MAKE A PROBLEM WORSE WE WANT TO

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:57.698
FIND. THE I THINK A LOT OF THE

01:38:57.765 --> 01:38:59.400
SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED HERE ARE

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:03.337
GOING TO BE SMALL STEPS SUCH AS

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:05.139
THE RIGHT OUT CREDIT ISSUE THAT

01:39:05.205 --> 01:39:08.208
AT LEAST TALKING ABOUT. SUCH AS

01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:09.310
SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:11.979
JOLT CALLED OUT GIVING PEOPLE

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:16.116

THINGS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR

01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:17.785
YOU. OUR ORGANIZATION IS VERY

01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:18.886
CLOSE TO THE GROUND SO ALL

HEAR FROM THEM ALL THE TIME AND

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:26.660
I HAD BEEN COMING UP HERE FOR

01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:27.328
MEETINGS OF THE STREAM

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:29.596
MORTALITY TASK FORCE AND INTO

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:30.931
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OVER THE

LAST FOUR YEARS BECAUSE- I SAW

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:34.601

WILD FIRES JUST MADE EVERYTHING

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:42.343
A LOT WORSE. SO THAT. WE HAVE A

01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:44.211
SURVEY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN

01:39:44.278 --> 01:39:46.413
CONDUCTING AND THE- THAT WE DO

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.881
SURVEYS THAT'S A BIG PART OF

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:50.718
OUR WORK AND THE FIGURE OF TWO

01:39:50.784 --> 01:39:51.285
THIRDS OF DISASTER SURVIVORS

01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:52.720
BEING UNDERINSURED COMES.

01:39:52.786 --> 01:39:54.688
LARGELY FROM OUR SURVEYS AND

01:39:54.755 --> 01:39:57.191
IT'S BEEN A CONSISTENT SURVEY

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:58.659
BUT I WANT TO PUT THAT ASIDE

01:39:58.726 --> 01:40:00.427
FROM IT WE HAVE A SURVEY GOING

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:03.197
ON OUR HOME PAGE. ON FOR DON

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:05.232
RENEWALS BECAUSE YEAH WE HAD

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:07.468
WERE WERE SORT OF PART OF OUR

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:08.802
JOB IS TO BE A FULL TIME NAG

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:11.004
AND WORRY WART. SO WE HAD BEEN

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:12.373
SAYING TO THE DEPARTMENT GOSH

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:14.241
YOU KNOW. SURPLUS LINES

01:40:14.308 --> 01:40:15.542
COMPANIES ARE PICKING UP A LOT

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:16.844
OF THE RISKS THAT THE NAME

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:17.811
BRAND CARRIERS HAD BEEN

01:40:17.878 --> 01:40:18.812
COVERING BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:21.248
COVERED BY SIGA. SO YEAH WE HAD

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:23.117
ONE COMPANY GO UNDER MERCED

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:24.284
FROM THE CAMPFIRE THAT'S- YOU

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:26.420
KNOW NOT GOOD BUT GREAT THAT IT

01:40:26.487 --> 01:40:28.789
WAS ONLY ONE WE DON'T WANT TO

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.524
BE. WE DON'T WANT THAT NUMBER

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:31.992
TO GROW AFTER THE NEXT RIGHT

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:33.494
EVENTS WE WANT TO KEEP AN EYE

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.763

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:39.733
GIVEN THAT. SURPLUS LINES

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.969
POLICIES ARE NOT BACKED BY THE

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:44.204

EQUIVALENT OF THE FAIR PLAN

01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:26.547
SUDDENLY THERE FAIR PLAN WAS

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:27.347

START FROM SCRATCH HERE WE CAN

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:04.418
BE LOOKING AT SOME OTHER

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:07.855
SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TRIED.

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:08.622

BY CONSUMERS BARTON JUST

01:42:12.826 --> 01:42:13.660
BECAUSE- BECAUSE WE WORK IN

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:14.695

01:42:28.742 --> 01:42:29.743
FROM THE PRICING BECAUSE THE

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.278
PRICING WOULD MAKE YOU THINK.

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:32.913

ALSO GET TO ENGAGE AT THE

01:42:46.193 --> 01:42:47.661
POLICY LEVEL WITH PEOPLE LIKE

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:49.963

01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.964
DROP BY YOUR INSURER IN

IS A DOUBLE SIDED SIMPLE

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:57.704
DOCUMENT THAT I WILL MAKE

INSURER TO CHANGE COURSE AND

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:06.413
AGREED TO RENEW YOU. WE TALK A

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.614
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOUR LOCAL

FIRE DEPARTMENT THEY HELP. YOU

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:12.386
BUT HERE AGAIN THIS CUT FALLS

01:43:12.452 --> 01:43:14.655
BACK IN YOUR LAP. WE DON'T HAVE

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:16.123
MITIGATION STANDARDS FOR WHILE

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:18.458
BUYER REDUCTION THE STATE. THE

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:20.694
INSURERS HAVE BEEN VERY VERY.

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:23.664
RELUCTANT TO VOLUNTARILY AGREE

01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:25.032
THEY YOU KNOW I'VE LEARNED NOT

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:27.100
TO USE THE WORD DISCOUNT. WHEN

01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:29.036
IT COMES TO YOU KNOW WILL IF

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:32.306
SOMEBODY DOES. DO WE WHACK AND

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:33.507
CLEAR BRUSH BILLION TO REWARD

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:35.842
THEM OR ARE THEY CAN JUST HAVE

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:36.843
WASTE OF THEIR TIME AND MONEY

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:40.247
AND NOW BE EVEN MORE. ANGRY AND

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:41.982
I THINK INSURERS ARE GOING TO

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.451
REALLY HAVE TO COME FORWARD I'D

01:43:44.518 --> 01:43:46.019
LIKE TO SEE THEM COME FORWARD

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:47.988
WITH THEIR IDEA BECAUSE-

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:49.289
THERE'S BEEN GENERALLY A SENSE

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:52.292
OF. WHY CAN'T WE DO DISCOUNTS

01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:54.895
CAN'T POLICE IF THEY CONTINUE

01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:55.529
TO BRIGHT WE HAVE TO DO

01:43:55.596 --> 01:44:02.202
SOMETHING. RIGHT BUT WE DON'T

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:10.611
HAVE. A RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:11.111
WHEN WE SAGE TO GET YOUR

01:44:11.178 --> 01:44:11.712
INSURANCE CHANGED COURSE IN.

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:13.113
THAT HAD BEEN GOOD ADVICE OF

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:13.780
PEOPLE WERE WORKING WITH A GOOD

01:44:13.847 --> 01:44:14.414
AGENT OR BROKER THAT THAT KNEW

01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:15.549
HOW TO FIND THE COMPANY THAT

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:16.149
WOULD WRITE BUT THAT SEEMS TO

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:16.783
BE GETTING EVEN HARDER. SO NOW

01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:17.351
I THINK WE DO HAVE TO GIVE

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:18.118
PEOPLE MORE TIME I THINK GIVING

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:18.919
THEM INSTEAD OF FORTY FIVE DAYS

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:19.753
NOTICE. GIVING HIM A HUNDRED

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.154
AND EIGHTY DAYS MAKES A LOT OF

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:23.357
SENSE. ELTON AND I THINK YOU

01:44:23.423 --> 01:44:24.491
KNOW GENERALLY THE CARRIERS NO.

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:25.459
YOU KNOW HALFWAY INTO THE

01:44:25.525 --> 01:44:26.693
POLICY YEAR WHETHER THEY'RE

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.327
GOING TO RENEW THAT POLICY OR

01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:29.763
NOT AND I THINK SO SOMETHING

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:31.198
MORE THAN FORTY FIVE IS

01:44:31.264 --> 01:44:33.967
DEFINITELY CALLED FOR. I THINK

01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:35.669
WE DO HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE AND

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:39.973
EDUCATION OF AGENTS ABOUT THE

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.241
FAIR PLAN YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:44:41.308 --> 01:44:42.676
AGENTS I TALK TO YEP. YESTERDAY

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:44.511
SAID WELL OF COURSE YOU CAN'T

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:45.245
GET A LEAD YOU CAN GET

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:46.446
TEMPORARY RANK COVERAGE THE

01:44:46.513 --> 01:44:48.949
FAIR PLAN. I CAN'T I FEEL SO I

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:49.716
DON'T WANT TO PUT ANY OF MY

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:51.318
CLIENTS IN THAT BECAUSE- THEY

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:52.619
COULD LOSE THEIR HOME IF THEY

01:44:52.686 --> 01:44:54.655
CAN'T PAY THEIR MORTGAGE. SO IT

01:44:54.721 --> 01:44:56.123
TURNS OUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:58.258
ACCURATE YOU CAN GET. SOME A.

01:44:58.325 --> 01:44:59.292
ELLIE COVERAGE OF THE FAIR PLAN

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:02.362
SO ALWAYS WITH THESE THESE WHAT

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:03.664
WE CALL RESIDUAL MARKET

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:05.399
PROGRAMS LIKE THE FLOOD.

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:08.235
POLICIES OR THE CIA A LOT OF

01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:10.070
AGENTS. REALLY THE BETTER

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:11.672
AGENTS DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH

01:45:11.738 --> 01:45:13.774
ABOUTTHESE PLANS BECAUSE THE

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:14.408
COMMISSIONS ARE LOWER AND THEY

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:15.709
DON'T LIKE TO PUT PEOPLE IN

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:16.910
THESE PLANS BECAUSE THEY DON'T.

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:18.211
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OR EAT AND

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:19.880
THEY THEY WOULD RATHER PUT A

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:20.947
MINUTE WITH A COMPANY THAT THEY

01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:23.150
KNOW. BUT NOW YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:45:23.216 --> 01:45:24.718
GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE

01:45:24.785 --> 01:45:26.420
EDUCATION ON THE PRODUCER SIDE.

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:29.723
I'M AND I THINK JUST TO TRY TO

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:31.091
GET CLOSER TO WRAPPING UP SO.

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:33.060
SO WHO STEP TWO DON'T PANIC

01:45:33.126 --> 01:45:36.396
STOP START SHOPPING. YOU KNOW A

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:37.197
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS FEELING

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:39.366
THAT GEE. YOU KNOW DON'T I HAVE

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:41.568
SOME VESTED RIGHTS HERE. I'VE

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:43.270
BEEN PAYING FOR THIS POLICY FOR

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:45.238
THIRTY YEARS AND YOU KNOW AND

01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:46.473
ALL THESE YEARS I NEVER HADA

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.775
CLAIM. HOW CAN THEY JUST DROP

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.444
ME WHEN I NOTHING'S CHANGED ON

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:52.979
MY END. SO YOU KNOW IT PEOPLE

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:59.019
ARE PRETTY SHOCKED WHEN YOU SAY.

01:45:59.086 --> 01:45:59.619
TO THEM THERE'S REALLY NOTHING

01:45:59.686 --> 01:46:07.427
THAT THIS. DATE OR A LAWYER

01:46:07.494 --> 01:46:08.028
COULD DO AS LONG AS THEY GAVE

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:08.895
YOU FORTY FIVE DAYS NOTICE. AND

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:09.463
AS LONG AS THEIR OF. THEIR

01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:09.996
COMPLYING WITH THEIR OWN

01:46:10.063 --> 01:46:10.630
UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES AND NOT

01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:11.364
BEING DISCRIMINATORY OR

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:12.599
INCONSISTENT. RIGHT SO. SO

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:13.834
AGAIN THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:15.669
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAYBE.

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:16.636
YOU KNOW WE WERE LOOKING TO

01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:17.237

PEOPLE YOU DON'T WANT. I DON'T

01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:22.075
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:46:22.142 --> 01:46:23.677
HEALTHY FOR OUR MARKET. SO

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:24.911
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A MIDDLE

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:27.280
GROUND. SO THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

01:46:27.347 --> 01:46:29.015

TRANSACTION IS NOT BEING ABLE

01:48:21.494 --> 01:48:22.562

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:33.139
EVEN IN THE ROUGH STAGES FOR

01:48:33.206 --> 01:48:35.642
PEOPLE WHO FOR WHOM THE PRICE

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:37.244

BURDEN FOR THEM YOU KNOW WHAT

01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:42.315
THEY HAD BEEN PAYING EIGHT

01:48:42.382 --> 01:48:43.183
HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR AND

01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:44.985
SUDDENLY THERE BILL AS SIX

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:46.987
THOUSAND. WE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:48.121

YOU KNOW BECAUSE INSURANCE IS

01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:55.629
DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR

CONSUMER PRODUCT YOU ARE

LEGALLY REQUIRED TO BUY IT YOU

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:02.903
YOU'RE A CAPTIVE IN A SENSE I

01:49:02.969 --> 01:49:03.737
THINK WE DO HAVE TO DEVELOP

01:49:03.803 --> 01:49:04.704
SOME SORT OF ASSISTANCE

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:05.939
PROGRAM. FOR PEOPLE WITH

PREMIUMS SO THAT THEY CAN

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:08.975
CONTINUE TO PROTECT THEIR

01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:11.878
ASSETS I'M FINALLY I DO THINK

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:14.247
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:49:14.314 --> 01:49:16.216
US TO TRY TO GET BACK TO SOME

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:21.054
SORT OF A AND A SIMPLER SIMPLER.

01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:22.689
POLICY THAT SO THAT PEOPLE

01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:26.359
DON'T HAVE TO BUY A FAIR PLAN

01:49:26.426 --> 01:49:32.265
POLICY I D. IC. UP FLOOD POLICY

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:39.306
EARTHQUAKE FORCE AT. POLICIES

01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:40.206
YOU KNOW IT JUST LIKE WE'VE

01:49:40.273 --> 01:49:40.974
BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:42.075
ANALYSIS AT OF THE AFFORDABLE

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:42.676
CARE ACT WHAT'S AN ESSENTIAL

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:43.944
BENEFIT. WHAT IS THE ABSOLUTE

01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:45.378
MOST ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF

01:49:45.445 --> 01:49:46.413
SOMEBODY'S HOME THAT WE KNOW

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:47.047
THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROTECTING

01:49:47.113 --> 01:49:48.982
AND CAN WE- HELP THE MARKET.

01:49:49.049 --> 01:49:51.351
YOU DEVELOP A SIMPLER BASIC

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.086
PRODUCT THAT WILL MEET THOSE

01:49:53.153 --> 01:49:54.754
NEEDS THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY

01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:56.589
AFFORD. AND I DO THINK SOME

01:49:56.656 --> 01:50:00.226
SOME EFFORT HAS TO GO INTO THAT

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:02.295

TO BOUNCE BACK WE DO WANT YOU

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:11.638
KNOW THE AS IT HAS. TYPICALLY

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:13.540

THAT'S TO HELP THE PUBLIC. FROM

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:07.754
MY POSITIONING. IT'S GOING TO

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:10.523
GET A LOT WORSE BEFORE IT GETS

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:12.792
BETTER NONE OF THIS HAPPENED IN

01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:15.695
A SHORT TERM IT HAS BEEN GOING

01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:18.498
ON FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS BEING

01:52:18.565 --> 01:52:21.034
A MEMBER OF RC RC AND WE BEGAN

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:22.702
TO LOOK AT THE TREE MORTALITY

01:52:22.769 --> 01:52:24.537
THE ISSUES IN THE FOOT HILLS.

01:52:24.604 --> 01:52:26.606
AND THEN THE FIRES. AND ALL OF

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:31.311
THIS HAS BEEN BUILDING. AND I'M

01:52:31.377 --> 01:52:33.413
IN A I'M IN A REALLY FOCUSES

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.048
MUCH AS THEY CAN BECAUSE TIME

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:39.018
IS VALUABLE ON YOUR PART. BUT

01:52:39.085 --> 01:52:39.619
THE WAY I'VE SEEN THIS FOR THE

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:45.325
LAST. A FEW MONTHS AT LEAST IS

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:47.093
THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS TO HEAD

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:50.029
DOWN THERE IS THE LONG TERM

01:52:50.096 --> 01:52:50.597
WORK ON THIS PROBLEM IN THE

01:52:50.663 --> 01:52:54.100
SHORT TERM. ONE OF THE SHORT

01:52:54.167 --> 01:52:56.336
TERM OBJECTIVES THAT I WOULD

01:52:56.402 --> 01:52:58.037
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:52:58.104 --> 01:53:01.141
GET INVOLVED WITH. IS BEING

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:04.010
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH

01:53:04.077 --> 01:53:07.680
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COVERAGE.

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:08.915
TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR DAILY

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:14.320
ISSUED NOW. THE LONG TERM WE'RE

01:53:14.387 --> 01:53:15.321
GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

01:53:15.388 --> 01:53:17.857
PUBLIC ATTITUDE THE WAY THEY

01:53:17.924 --> 01:53:20.293
LOOK AT INSURANCE THE WAY THEY

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:23.563
MODIFIED THEIR LIFESTYLE. THE

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:26.132
COMMUNITIES HARDENING OF OUR

01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:27.267
COMMUNITIES AND WORKING ON A

01:53:27.333 --> 01:53:30.737
STATE PROGRAM. AND I'VE SEEN

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:32.138
THAT I'VE BEEN TO MORE

01:53:32.205 --> 01:53:34.207
COMMITTEE MEETINGS MORE

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:34.807
MEETINGS WITH THE STATE THAN I

01:53:34.874 --> 01:53:37.877
EVER THOUGHT MORE OUT THERE. AN

01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:40.613
ICY COOPERATION THIS HEADED IN

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.383
THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO I THINK

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:45.151
THAT THAT PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:45.718
IS ACTUALLY COMING TOGETHER

01:53:45.785 --> 01:53:49.989
PRETTY WELL. NOW COMES A WHAT

01:53:50.056 --> 01:53:52.792
CAN WE DO IN A RELATIVELY SHORT

01:53:52.859 --> 01:53:55.328
PERIOD OF TIME. I'LL TELL YA

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:57.163
JUST IN THE LAST HOUR I'VE

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:59.732
HEARD SOME GREAT IDEAS I THINK

01:53:59.799 --> 01:54:01.401
YOU HAVE A VERY TALENTED ROOM

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:04.170
FULL OF EXPERTS HERE. THE

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:06.139
RUNNER POSITION THEY CAN

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:08.708
ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:09.943
AND CAN DO THINGS FOR THE

01:54:10.009 --> 01:54:11.477
PUBLIC IN A RELATIVELY SHORT

01:54:11.544 --> 01:54:15.448
PERIOD OF TIME. AND I'M GONNA

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:17.550
GIVE IT JUST A COUPLE OF IDEAS

01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:19.152
THAT I'VE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH

01:54:19.219 --> 01:54:24.123
ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER ON. I

01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:27.427
WOULD TAKE THE FAIR PLAN. AND I

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:30.230
WOULD TRY AND ENHANCE IT WITH A

01:54:30.296 --> 01:54:32.298
HUNDRED AND 25% A HUNDRED AND

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:35.902
50% 2100% OF OPPORTUNITY TO

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:38.304
ENSURE THEIR HOUSE. THERE'S

01:54:38.371 --> 01:54:40.039
LOTS OF DETAILS ATTACHED TO

01:54:40.106 --> 01:54:43.943
THIS AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY.

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.646
BUT I THINK AGAIN WITHIN A FIVE

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:48.348
MINUTE DISCUSSION WITH THE FARE

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:49.749
PAYING A PLAN IN THE BACK OF

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:51.551
THIS ROOM I THINK THERE'S

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:53.386
OPPORTUNITY IN A WILL TO MAKE

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:55.421
CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN ONCE YOU

01:54:55.488 --> 01:54:57.023
PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE AROUND THE

01:54:57.090 --> 01:54:58.625
TABLE. AND ACTUALLY THINK YOU

01:54:58.691 --> 01:55:01.227
HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE HERE. I

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:03.763
WOULD DO THAT NUMBER ONE. I'D

01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:06.399
ALSO LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:55:06.466 --> 01:55:08.601
ENHANCE THE FAIR PLAN WITH

01:55:08.668 --> 01:55:12.372
SPECIAL FORM COVERAGE. IF THE

01:55:12.438 --> 01:55:14.707
NOT SPECIAL FORM AT THE VERY

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:17.543
LEAST BROAD FORM COVERAGE AND

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.879
THESE ARE TERMINOLOGIES THAT IN

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:21.748
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY A LOT OF

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:23.950
US TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND AND I

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:26.185
DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO

01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:28.855
GO INTO DETAIL AT THIS POINT. I

01:55:28.921 --> 01:55:29.922
THINK THE LIABILITY IS STILL A

01:55:29.989 --> 01:55:33.593
CRITICAL PIECE OF AT. WHEN YOU

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.395
ADD THE LIABILITY TO ANY

01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:37.597
HOMEOWNERS THE SPECIAL FOR THE

01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:40.466
SPECIAL AND THE LIABILITY THAT

01:55:40.533 --> 01:55:42.135
COMES IN THE STANDARD PREFERRED

01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:42.669
MARKET POLICY THEY'RE NOT

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:46.239
EXPENSIVE. YOU HAVE TO WORK

01:55:46.306 --> 01:55:48.007
WITH THEM A BIT AND HAVE

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:50.176
EXCLUSIONS RATHER IT'S A PIT

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:52.912
BULL AN ELEPHANT OR HER TO

CATTLE IN YOUR BACKYARD YOU

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:56.416
HAVE EXCLUSIONS BUT YET YOU

STILL PROVIDE LIABILITY MOST OF

01:55:59.052 --> 01:56:00.920
YOUR HOMEOWNER POLICIES AS YOU

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:02.288

SAME EXCLUSION CAN BE ATTACHED

01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:11.531
TO THE FAIR PLAN I DON'T

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:12.131
BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE THAT

01:56:12.198 --> 01:56:16.135
COMPLICATED. I ALSO BELIEVE

01:56:16.202 --> 01:56:18.338
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A BIT OF

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:19.672
RE UNDERWRITING WITHIN THE FAIR

01:56:19.739 --> 01:56:24.010

01:56:24.077 --> 01:56:25.178
THAT NEED TO BE MODIFIED THAT

01:56:25.244 --> 01:56:30.717
WOULD BE FINANCIALLY PRUDENT I

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:31.818
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

01:56:31.884 --> 01:56:32.452
INTENTION HERE TO UNDERMINE THE

01:56:32.518 --> 01:56:35.588
FAIR PLAN. I THINK WHAT WE'RE

01:56:35.655 --> 01:56:38.758
TRYING TO DO AS A CONSUMER. IS

01:56:38.825 --> 01:56:42.362
TO HELP THEM BUILD ONE POLICY

01:56:42.428 --> 01:56:44.864
NOT TO BUILD MULTIPLE POLICIES

01:56:44.931 --> 01:56:45.331
THAT BEGIN TO GET VERY

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:48.935
EXPENSIVE. I'VE HEARD OF THE

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:51.537

01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:53.506

01:56:57.944 --> 01:57:00.480
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT

01:57:00.546 --> 01:57:04.317
IS UNREALISTIC. THAT WILL HAVE

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:07.553
AN IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES ON

01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.223

01:57:11.457 --> 01:57:14.060

ABOUT THE OTHER PART OF THE

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:25.477
WHENEVER POSSIBLE. I THINK THE

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:25.978
OTHER THING WE NEED TO

02:06:26.045 --> 02:06:28.213
UNDERSTAND IS AVAILABILITY AND

02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:29.281
AFFORDABILITY ARE TWO DIFFERENT

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:30.883
ISSUES. I LIVE IN CHARGE IS

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:32.384
AVAILABLE BUT AN INDIVIDUAL

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:33.585
DOES NOT LIKE THE PRICE WHICH

02:06:33.652 --> 02:06:34.954
WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:36.622
PRICES ARE GOING UP THAT'S NOT

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:38.190
THE SAME THING AS NOT HAVING A

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.224
CHAIRED. CHARTS AVAILABLE TO

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:40.859
YOU WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:42.161
AS WE LOOK AT THE VARIOUS

02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:43.228
ELEMENTS THAT WE USE THAT

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:44.897
SOMEWHAT TO JUDGE WHETHER NOT

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:45.965
THE VOLUNTARY MARKET IS

02:06:46.031 --> 02:06:47.633
WORKING. OUT WE HAVE THREE

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:52.905
TOOLS WE HAVE THE FAIR PLAN.

02:06:52.972 --> 02:06:53.505
YOUR TO PRESENTATION FROM THEM

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:58.444
THAT THEY HAVE. SOME. INCREASED

02:06:58.510 --> 02:07:00.145
BUT NOT DRAMATIC INCREASES YOU

02:07:00.212 --> 02:07:01.246
HEARD FROM THE SURPLUS LINES

02:07:01.313 --> 02:07:01.814
INJURED. INDUSTRY THAT THEY

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:03.082
HAVE SOME INCREASE BUT NOT A

02:07:03.148 --> 02:07:04.516
DRAMATIC INCREASE. ANOTHER TOOL

02:07:04.583 --> 02:07:05.551
THAT WE USE IS WHETHER NOT.

02:07:05.617 --> 02:07:06.352
HOMEOWNERS ARE UNABLE TO FIND

02:07:06.418 --> 02:07:07.119
INSURANCE AND THEREFORE THEIR

02:07:07.186 --> 02:07:08.821
LENDER PLACES AND CHARTS ON THE

02:07:08.887 --> 02:07:11.223
PROPERTY TO PROTECT THE LENDER.

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:12.458
I KNOW HAVING HAD THIS HAPPEN

02:07:12.524 --> 02:07:15.194
TO BE ONCE. A BY MISTAKE. ODD

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:15.861
THAT THE POLICIES ARE

02:07:15.928 --> 02:07:17.896
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE. I

02:07:17.963 --> 02:07:19.298
THE COVERAGES MARCH LESS AND IT

02:07:19.365 --> 02:07:20.432
REALLY REALLY GETS YOUR

02:07:20.499 --> 02:07:22.134
ATTENTION. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH

02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:23.869
WE HAVE NOT HEARD MUCH ABOUT

02:07:23.936 --> 02:07:24.937
LENDER PLACED IN CHARGE OF THIS

02:07:25.004 --> 02:07:26.472
MARKET PLACE. WHICH WOULD BE

02:07:26.538 --> 02:07:27.806
LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE

02:07:27.873 --> 02:07:29.174
ARE ABLE TO FIND INSURANCE

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:29.908
SOMEWHERE TO MAKE SURE THEY

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:30.642
MEET THEIR MORTGAGE

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:32.644
APPLICATIONS. ONE THING WE

02:07:32.711 --> 02:07:34.046
DISCOVERED AB TALKED ABOUT THE

02:07:34.113 --> 02:07:35.114
TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:36.348
INSURANCE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WE

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:40.886
BOTH SERVED ON. IT WAS AS MUCH

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:45.491
FUN AS YOU COULD IMAGINE. ONE

02:07:45.557 --> 02:07:46.058
OF THAT WE HAD THIS DEBATE.

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:46.658
CONSTANTLY ABOUT AVAILABILITY

02:07:46.725 --> 02:07:47.860
AND AFFORDABILITY AND NOT QUITE

02:07:47.926 --> 02:07:48.594
UNDERSTAND IT WHETHER OR NOT

02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:51.663
INSURANCE WAS AVAILABLE A PART

02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:52.664
OF IT CAME DOWN TO WE GET

02:07:52.731 --> 02:07:54.266
STARTED TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:55.134
MARKETS AND UNDERSTAND THAT

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.869
COMPETITION IN THE MARKET AND

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:58.170
CONSUMERS ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE

02:07:58.237 --> 02:08:00.339
HOW TO SHOP FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:03.175

HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS NOT

02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:07.279
AVAILABLE. BECAUSE YOU'RE USED

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:08.747
TO THAT RELATIONSHIP IF YOU

WORK WITH AN AGENT WHO MAY ONLY

SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTS THAT THE

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:18.303
DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND

02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:20.272
THEY OR THEIR OPTION IS ONLY

02:16:20.338 --> 02:16:21.873
GOING WITH A MINUTE. CARRIERS

02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:24.709
IN THE SAME SCENARIO. YOU'RE

02:16:24.776 --> 02:16:25.343
JUST KIND OF GOING FORWARD HAVE

02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:27.212
BEEN IN THE BUSINESS ABOUT

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:28.179
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND DECEMBER

02:16:28.246 --> 02:16:29.848
WAS THE FIRST TIME I WROTE. A

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:31.883
FAIR PLAN POLICY. AND THIS WHEN

02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:34.386
THE NON ON RULES STARTED COME

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:35.954
THROUGH FOR PEOPLE. AND I THINK

02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:38.356
PEOPLE. IT MADE SENSE THEY WERE

02:16:38.423 --> 02:16:39.357
SHOCKED IT MADE SENSE THEY TOOK

02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:42.160
THINGS IN STRIDE. AND THEN ONCE

02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:43.862
THE FOUR ONE. RATE INCREASE

02:16:43.929 --> 02:16:46.531
HIT. ALL THE SOLUTIONS REALLY

02:16:46.598 --> 02:16:48.633
BECAME A SUPER UNREASONABLE AND

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:49.935
OTHERS. TO SO I DEFINITELY

02:16:50.001 --> 02:16:51.269
THINK THERE'S SOME FACTORS ARE

02:16:51.336 --> 02:16:52.437
SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT FOR

02:16:52.504 --> 02:16:54.239
THE FAIR PLANTED. TO ENHANCE

02:16:54.306 --> 02:16:55.273
THEIR PRODUCT TO LOOK AT

02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:56.341
DISCOUNTS RIGHT NOW THE ONLY

02:16:56.408 --> 02:16:57.409
DISCOUNT AVAILABLE AS THE FIRE

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:59.911
WISE. COMMUNITY DISCOUNT WHICH

02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:01.846
IS A 10% DISCOUNT. PARADISE WAS

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:04.049
ACTUALLY. CLASSIFIED IN FAR WHY

02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:07.118
IS. A FAR WISE COMMUNITY. IN EL

02:17:07.185 --> 02:17:08.486
DORADO COUNTY I THINK

02:17:08.553 --> 02:17:12.390
PERSONALLY FLATS IS THE ONLY.

02:17:12.457 --> 02:17:13.024
ONE THAT'S- BASED ON THAT SO AS

02:17:13.091 --> 02:17:16.995
FAR AS ERRORS. OF OPPORTUNITY I

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:17.596
WOULD SAY DISCOUNTS WOULD BE

02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:18.763
GREAT ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT

02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:19.598
PEOPLE DO TAKE MEASURES TO MAKE

02:17:19.664 --> 02:17:20.765
THEIR HOUSE MORE FIRE SAFE YOU

02:17:20.832 --> 02:17:21.366
KNOW THE TERM HARDENING HOME

02:17:21.433 --> 02:17:23.268
RATHER. STEPS ON THERE'S NO

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:24.703
DISCOUNT FOR ANY OF THAT THOSE

02:17:24.769 --> 02:17:26.838
EFFORTS. ON IT ACTUALLY COST

02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:28.607
MORE YOUR INSURANCE COSTS MORE

02:17:28.673 --> 02:17:29.474
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:17:29.541 --> 02:17:31.376
INCREASING REPLACEMENT COST. SO

02:17:31.443 --> 02:17:32.777
THE SO THE COST TO REPLACE YOUR

02:17:32.844 --> 02:17:34.713
HOME WOULD BE MORE SO. THERE'S

02:17:34.779 --> 02:17:36.114
DEFINITELY SOME AREAS WHERE I

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:37.215
DON'T THINK WE'RE FOR IN THE

02:17:37.282 --> 02:17:38.283
SHORT TERM THERE COULD BE SOME

02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:39.517
THINGS THAT COULD BE LOOKED AT

02:17:39.584 --> 02:17:40.919
TO MAKE THINGS MORE REASONABLE.

02:17:40.986 --> 02:17:43.822
FOR CONSUMERS IT IT'S BEEN.

02:17:43.888 --> 02:17:47.158
REALLY SHOCKING TO SEE IT YOU

02:17:47.225 --> 02:17:47.759
KNOW EVEN IN CASES WHERE. THE

02:17:47.826 --> 02:17:50.795
FIRE HYDRANT IS. JUST A FOOT

02:17:50.862 --> 02:17:51.563
PASSED A THOUSAND FEET FROM

02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:52.130
THEIR HOUSE THAT COMMUNITY

02:17:52.197 --> 02:17:54.065
FRIENDS OF A THREE THOUSAND

02:17:54.132 --> 02:17:54.599
DOLLAR PREMIUM DIFFERENCE

02:17:54.666 --> 02:17:55.133
LITERALLY BECAUSE THE FIRE

02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:58.136
HYDRANTS. JUST NOT ONE FOOT

02:17:58.203 --> 02:18:00.672
CLOSER AND SIMILAR WITH THE

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:02.340
FIRE THE FIRE STATION SITUATION

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:04.743
IT'S A BIG ISSUE THERE'S- YOUR

02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:06.111
I KNOW IN ELDORADO COUNTY

02:18:06.177 --> 02:18:07.078
THERE'S FIVE THERE'S A FEW

02:18:07.145 --> 02:18:08.313
CASES WHERE THE FIRE HAD FIRE

02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:09.514
STATIONS. ARE NOT CONSIDERED

02:18:09.581 --> 02:18:12.083
MAN FULL TIME. THE MANDARIN THE

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:13.084
FIRE SEASON WHERE MATTERS THE

02:18:16.354 --> 02:18:17.856
ELDRED SO THAT AGAIN THAT'S A-

02:18:17.922 --> 02:18:20.191
ABOUT A THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR

02:18:20.258 --> 02:18:20.792

THE STREET IS CONSIDERED MAN SO

02:18:23.628 --> 02:18:25.230
THERE'S JUST SOME THINGS ON THE

SHORT TERM THE CAN WE LOOK AT

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:27.766

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.632
BUT FIELD HEARINGS. WITHIN THE

02:21:47.699 --> 02:21:50.602
COMMUNITY. I DILIGENTLY TRACK

02:21:50.668 --> 02:21:52.303
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ARE AND

02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:53.905
LEARNING TO AT THE LEGISLATURE

02:21:53.972 --> 02:21:55.306
BUT MOST PEOPLE IN THE

02:21:55.373 --> 02:21:56.407
COMMUNITY ARE AWARE OF THIS AND

02:21:56.474 --> 02:21:57.976
THERE I THINK THAT. THAT'S

02:21:58.042 --> 02:21:59.210
REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT

02:21:59.277 --> 02:22:00.912
COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE AND MAKE

02:22:00.979 --> 02:22:01.512
SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AT THE

02:22:01.579 --> 02:22:03.248
TABLE WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED.

02:22:03.314 --> 02:22:04.883

02:22:04.949 --> 02:22:05.917
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE

02:22:05.984 --> 02:22:07.785
IN THE COMMISSIONER WHO HAS.

02:22:07.852 --> 02:22:08.820

STAKEHOLDERS AND THAT'S REALLY

02:22:11.656 --> 02:22:12.991
IMPORTANT STEP BUT I THINK IT'S

02:22:13.057 --> 02:22:14.125
A LEGISLATURE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

02:22:14.192 --> 02:22:15.827
