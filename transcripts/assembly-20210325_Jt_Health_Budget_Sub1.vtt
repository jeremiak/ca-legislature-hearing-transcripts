MINIMUM THRESHOLD AND STANDARD

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:15.633
BUT IT IS A NATIONAL STANDARD

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.368
THAT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:23.708
MEET OUR EXISTING ROBUST. AND-

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.810

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:29.113
IN THIS LEAGUE IS BASED IN. TWO

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.115

THIS PROPOSAL LEAVES DISCRETION

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:43.628
TO DH CS TO DECIDE WHETHER. TO

DECIDE WHAT THEY CAN MONITOR-

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.466
BASED ON NCQA STANDARDS THAT

WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS FULLY

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.963

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.765
ALL STANDARDS IT'S UNCLEAR IF

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:22.633
THERE WILL BE A REQUIRED

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.869

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.906

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:36.514
THESE ARE APPROPRIATE AND

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:38.449
SUFFICIENT STAKEHOLDERS IT

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:39.951

WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT BASED ON

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:15.039
SOME OF THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS.

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:15.639

COULD ON. AS AS THE- KNOWS I'VE

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.580
AUTHORED BILLS THAT WOULD.

00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:24.381
ESTABLISH A QUALITY ASSESSMENT

QUALITY AND FOR US TO REDUCE

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.592
HEALTH DISPARITIES. CONSIDERING

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:35.960
THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT

00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:37.561
THAT. WE ARE PUTTING INTO

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:39.997
CALTRAIN HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL

IMPROVEMENT. SO WHAT I WOULD

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.272
SAY IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:51.175
TAKE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:52.743
TO HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING QUALITY

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.079
OF ONE ASPECT IS THE PROPOSAL

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:58.449
TO- HAVE. NCQA ACCREDITATION

00:41:58.515 --> 00:42:00.551
WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR. A SET OF

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:03.120
STANDARD RULES ACROSS ALL PLANS

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.855
IN REGARDS TO THE QUALITY

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:05.723
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY HAVE

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:08.092
IN PLACE- BUT THAT IS JUST ONE

00:42:08.158 --> 00:42:10.527
OF THE VARIOUS PIECES I WE ALSO

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:14.365
HAVE BEEN OF. INCREASING OUR

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.499

IT WILL BE LOOKING AT OTHER

00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:22.473
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN REALLY

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:23.874

SPACE. I THINK WE ARE CLEARLY

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:32.316
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED TO

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:34.285
THINK DIFFERENTLY AROUND HOW WE

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:35.953
WORK WITH OUR MANAGED CARE

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.088

INTEGRATION UP OF PROJECTS THAT

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:52.036
WE'RE DOING ACROSS THE STATE OF

00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:53.637
CALIFORNIA IS WE KNOW IT'S

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:54.805
GOING TO BE A COMBINATION OF A

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:55.706
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:57.474
TO HELP US MOVE THAT QUALITY

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:59.810

THIS. PRESENTATION ASSEMBLY

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.885
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT

PLANTS ACTUALLY HAVE THE

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.587
ABILITY TO DO OUTRAGE AND

THEY HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.059
POSSIBLE TO DO THAT SO I THINK

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.327

SAY THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT.

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:54.531
THE COST TO FOR A CO TO UNDERGO

OF A MILLION DOLLARS AND SO.

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:02.539
THAT MEANS THAT'S A MILLION

00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:04.041
DOLLARS IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:06.043
GO TO PROPERLY TO PATIENT CARE

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.545
OR OR WHATEVER- AND IF YOU'RE

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:09.513
HOLDING THEM TO THE SAME

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.448

EVER CHANGE OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.084
WHAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:16.020
THAT- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE BEING

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:18.188

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:36.900
THESE FLOW MORSE. ADDITIONALLY

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.608
NOT OF THIS MEDICAID MANAGED

00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:47.511
CARE PLANS- INCLUDING THE WHO

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:50.147
TO ARE CURRENTLY REALLY SOME TO

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:51.782
COST COMPETITION. TO OPERATE

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:54.217
MORE THE THEN AND IT IT WOULD

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:56.219
COME THIS BY. BUT CHEN NOT

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:57.888
REMEMBER PLANS FOR THE FOLKS OF

00:50:57.954 --> 00:50:59.823
THIS THEY PAY FOR IF THOSE ARE

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.392
IF THOSE ARE COST- OUR

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.094
OPPONENTS GET REIMBURSED FOR

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:05.662
THE- COST OF THE PLANS WITHIN

THEIR OWN RE WHAT VERY

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:11.401
ADJUSTMENTS- AS MISS CAN- AND

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:13.003
SO HERE THE HIGHER. WERE

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.870
RECEIVE LESS THAN REIMBURSE

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:15.172
WHILE THE LOWER PLANS WOULD

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:18.074
RECEIVE A FINAL PLANNER- DUE TO

00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:22.045
LEVEL- AS PREVIOUSLY- AS

00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:24.714
PREVIOUSLY THOUGH THE DALLAS

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:25.449
THE POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE OF THIS

00:51:25.515 --> 00:51:26.950
FOR IS THAT IT MY WOULD PRODUCE

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:29.152
DIFFERENT WINNERS AND LOSERS.

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:31.288
THEN UNDER TODAY'S- SIX- PERCH

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:47.871
THOSE. WHO NOT. THE SOUND

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:50.073
PUBLIC POLICY PROVIDED IMPROVED

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.108
EFFICIENCY WITHOUT COMPARING

THE BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCE

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:56.780
SUCH AS BY REDUCING ACCESS OR

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:59.483
QUALITY OF CARE. TODAY WE DO

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:02.686
UNDERSTAND THAT THE STTE'S-HIGHER COST MEDICAL PLANS ARE

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.221
OFTEN DO PERFORM SOMEWHAT

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:05.522
BETTER THAN SOME OF THE LOWER

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:07.190
COST PLANS ON A RANGE OF

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:09.159
ACCESSING QUALITY MEASURES. AND

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:10.560
THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:11.795
WHETHER THE TRANSITION TO

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.296
REGIONAL RATE SETTING WHAT

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:15.031
IMPROVING EFFICIENCY BUT AT THE

00:52:15.098 --> 00:52:18.401
COST OF. ACCESSING QUALITY AND

PRESENT THAT PERSPECTIVE OF THE

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.244
HOPE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:03.079
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:06.082
ASSOCIATION- OF LAW LOCAL

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:08.718
HEALTH PLANS. LIKE OURS I'M SO

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:11.922
THE KEY QUESTION WE HAVE IS

00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:13.623
ABOUT REGIONAL RIGHT STATING IS

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.425
WE DON'T QUESTION THE VALUE OF

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:16.593
DOING IT BUT RATHER THE

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.061
QUESTION IS WILL IT BE DONE

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.963
PROPERLY AND FAIRLY. THERE IS

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.831
TREMENDOUS VARIATION ACROSS THE

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:23.466
LOCAL HEALTH CARE MARKETS EVEN

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.635
IF- PLANS HAVE STANDARDIZED

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:27.971
BENEFITS SO IN THE BAY AREA FOR

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.740
EXAMPLE- IN NOT HOSPITAL

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:33.710
MARKETS ARE BEARISH OUR REGION.

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:36.146
ON UCSF CONTRACTS WITH SAN

00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:37.547
FRANCISCO HEALTH PLAN THE SAME

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:39.282
BASIS IS THAT CONTRACTS WITH

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:40.917
ANY OTHER HOSPITAL IN SCOTT

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:42.786
THAT'S CONTRACTED WITH WITH THE

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:44.588
HEALTH PLAN YES YOU SEE STAFF

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:45.889
DEMANDS A PERCENTAGE OF

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:48.224
CHARGES. I'M FROM THE HELP PLAN

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:50.193
A SAN MATTEO AND OUR MEMBERS

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.895
JUST LIVE A FEW MILES OUTSIDE

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.763
OF SAN FRANCISCO SO ONE

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.298
QUESTION THAT WE HAVE IS HOW

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.334
WILL DH D. H. U. S. ACCOUNT FOR

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.935
THE REAL ON HEALTH CARE COST

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:01.204
DIFFERENCES. AMONG COUNTIES

00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:02.072
THAT MAY BE GROUPED INTO THE

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:04.341
SAME REGION WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:07.777
DETAIL ON THAT YET- AS- DEPUTY

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:09.179
DIRECTOR HARRINGTON MENTIONED

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:10.847
RESEARCH JASMINE IS- IS A

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.816
PRIMARY METHOD USED FOR IS.

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:14.417
ASSESSING THE RISK OF SERVING

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:16.486
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THAT IS

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:17.787
FOR COMPENSATING A PLAN THAT

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:19.656
HAS MEMBERS WITH MORE HEALTH

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:23.193
ISSUES AND THEREBY- WITH HIGHER

00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:26.062
COSTS. AND SO WE UNDERSTAND

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:27.230
RISK IT JUST MEANS LIKELY TO BE

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.765
USED FOR STUDY RATES AMONG

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.934
PLANS IN OUR REGION- BUT I

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:32.102
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:54:32.168 --> 00:54:33.436
THAT RISK ADJUSTMENT IS A

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:35.605
PROBLEMATIC METHODOLOGY. IT IS

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:37.340
A CERTAIN ZERO SUM GAME SO

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:38.908
THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.677
LOSERS AS HAS BEEN NOTED. ON

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.545
ITS USE NOW IN THE G. PLAN

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.147
COUNTIES AND THE RISKS ARE NOT

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:45.715
APPROPRIATELY CAPTURED

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:47.651
ACCORDING TO ANALYSES THAT

00:54:47.717 --> 00:54:49.653
WE'VE DONE ON USING IT.

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:58.428
ACTUARIES HARD BY LH. PC EVEN

00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:00.063
THE MAN ALL ONLY ACCOUNT FOR OF

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.865
THE- D. A. KERR APPROACH

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:04.100
EXPLAIN ABOUT PER OF THE REST.

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:04.601
AND THE PROPOSED FUTURE

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.836
APPROACH IS- BELONGINGS. LIKE

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:08.738
US HIGHER PERCENTAGE- HEALTH

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:10.607
PLAN TO STORE BUT- THE HIGHEST

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:12.342
RISK MEMBERS IF THE CURRENT

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:13.943
RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY IS

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:16.613
CONSISTENTLY AND REPRESENTED.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.180
THE COSTS OF THESE HIGH RISK

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:19.449
MEMBERS. OF STUDIES PRODUCED BY

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:21.151
THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES AND

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:22.585
CONCLUDED THAT NO RISK

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.020
ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY CAN

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:25.955
FULLY EXPLAIN RISK DIFFERENCES

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:27.857
IN THE PRESENCE OF SIGNIFICANT.

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:29.959
RISK VARIATION AMONG PLANTS.

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:31.394
EXPECTED RESULT AND WOULD BE%

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:35.598
UNDER FUNDING PLANS. WHICH

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:36.199
SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:38.334
NEEDS. I ANY ON ON THE LINE

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.936
PROBLEMS WITH THIS JUST ME

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.538
MATTHEY WHICH IS METHODOLOGY

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:46.109
BUT ONLY COME. IN WHICH RIGHT.

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:46.743
I'M FINE WE DON'T HAVE DAY ON

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:49.512
THE AND ON CEILING PLANS PLANTS

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:50.914
BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT BEEN PART

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.115
OF ANY OF THE STATE RESIDUALS

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:54.084
AND EFFORTS TODAY SO THAT IS

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.151
SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'RE

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.886
CONCERNED ABOUT. WITH THE CODES

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:59.122
PLANTS. NOW TO STAND BY- SAYING

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.457
THAT THAT THAT STATE YOU REALLY

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.258
DECIDE ON ITS POLICY GOALS UP

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:06.229
FRONT- SO FOR EXAMPLE AND- THEN

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:07.997
JOHNSON POINTED OUT THE CLOSE

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:08.965
MODEL PLANS IT CONSISTENTLY

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.567
SCORED AMONG THE HIGHEST.

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:14.637
QUALITY SCORES- HOW WILL

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.106
QUALITY BE INCORPORATE THE

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:17.874
RIGHTS PROCESS AGAIN WHEN

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:20.944
COURAGE ONTO YOUR THAT THE-

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.879
DOES PLAN. TO REALLY AND CALL

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:24.948
IN THE RIGHT SETTING. HOW MUCH

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:27.117
DEEPLY THAN IT HAS TODAY- WILL

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:28.752
PROGRESS QUALITY INNOVATION

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.954
LOST PLANS ARE DRIVEN TO

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.655
FORWARD IT YOU COST

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:34.858
EFFICIENCIES. AND AND I THINK

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:36.159
ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT POINT

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.427
IS RISK ADJUSTMENT WILL NOT

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:39.295
ACCOUNT FOR HEALTH DISPARITY.

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:40.597
IF THE REGIONAL RATE SETTING

00:56:40.663 --> 00:56:42.232
PROCESS DOES NOT ADEQUATELY

00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:43.733
RECOGNIZED THAT YOU REDUCE

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.301
FIRST DISPARITIES ADEQUATE

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:46.402
FUNDING PERHAPS EVEN MORE

00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:48.371
FUNDING NEEDS TO BE DIRECTED TO

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:49.906
COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDERS WERE

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:52.642
DISPARITIES ARE HIGHER. I'M TO

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:53.943
THE EXTENT REGENERATE SAID HE

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.745
DOES NOT PRIORITIZE QUALITY

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.514
ACCESS INNOVATION AND

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.581
COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITIES

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.150
BEING SIR THERE MAY BE

00:57:00.216 --> 00:57:01.718
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ON

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:03.186
LOCAL HEALTH PLANTS. SO WE'VE

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:05.388
TO RECOMMENDATIONS ON FIRST-

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:08.258
AND WE YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:09.626
THIS WILL BE THE CASE BUT

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:10.593
HEALTH PLANS NEED TO BE AT THE

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.595
TABLE HELPING DESIGN THE

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:13.329
STRUCTURE FOR REGIONAL RATE

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:15.064
SETTING. AND SECONDLY IT WAS A

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:16.366
HIGHLY TECHNICAL THIS WILL BE A

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:18.234
CRITICAL INITIATIVE AND THE

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:19.836
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE INVOLVED

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:21.171
TO ENSURE THAT IT'S FAIR AND

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:22.672
HELPS ACHIEVE THE OVERALL STATE

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:24.374
POLICY GOALS IN THE MEDICARE

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:34.317
PROGRAM- THANK YOU. HAPPY TO

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:34.951

VERY MUCH NOW WE WILL HEAR

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:38.421
DOCTOR. DATE COULD TOLD T. WHO

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:39.422
IS. CENTER PALO ALTO.

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:42.425
FOUNDATION IN SANTA CRUZ C.

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:44.194
THANK GOODNESS AND THANK YOU MY-

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.029

FUN TODAY I AM WE ARE WE HAVE A

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:49.966
MASS VACCINATION CLINIC AND

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:51.634
I'VE COME IN FROM OUTSIDE-

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.236
DOING THAT WORK I HAVE A COUPLE

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.704
REFLECTIONS AT THE END OF MY-

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.906
TIME I LIKE TO SHARE. BUT FIRST

00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:58.341
I LET THIS WORK LET ME JUST SAY

00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:00.176
THIS WORK IS SO IMPORTANT AND I

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:02.212
APPRECIATE THE FOCUS THAT

00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:03.046
YOU'RE MAKING BECAUSE THIS IS

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:05.181
TRANSFORMATIONAL IN A FIFTY

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:06.082
PLUS YEARS OF MEDICAID IN

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.384
CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN LICENSE IN

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:10.320
IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTY NINE

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:12.355
YEARS THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:13.957
TRANSFORMATIONAL. SET OF

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:16.259
CHANGES I'VE SEEN IN SO FROM

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.827
THE PERSPECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:20.230
PHYSICIANS CARING FOR OUR OUR

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:22.098
MEDIC CAL MEMBERS. IS AN

00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:24.200
OPPORTUNITY TO IN IN IN BUILD

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:26.769
TRUST AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.972
WE CAN ENCOURAGE OR BUILD

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:31.274
TRUST- FOR THE- PHYSICIANS IN

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:33.776
CALIFORNIA IS MAKE THE WORK

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:35.411
TRANSPARENT MAKE THE FEE

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:37.914
SCHEDULE TRANSPARENT. AS BEST

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:40.350
AS POSSIBLE DON'T REINVENT THE

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:43.319
WHEEL AS WE MOVE- SO MANY OF

00:58:43.386 --> 00:58:46.022
THESE DUAL BENEFICIARIES INTO

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:48.024
THE INTO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM A

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:52.495
LINE ARE. HOW WE VIEW AND RISK

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:55.164
ADJUST AND BUILD GEOGRAPHIES

00:58:55.231 --> 00:58:56.232
ALIGNED WITH WHAT MEDICARE IS

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:58.534
DOING AND KEEP IN MIND THE

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:01.004
QUADRUPLE AIM WHICH WOULD BE-

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.940
IMPROVE PATIENT EXPERIENCE

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:05.975
IMPROVE PROVIDER EXPERIENCE.

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:08.044
IMPROVE CLINICAL QUALITY AND

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:09.612
LOWER THE TOTAL COST OF CARE

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:10.713
AND I THINK THERE'S AN

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.548
OPPORTUNITY TO DO ALL FOUR OF

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:14.684
THOSE. SO LET ME JUST BRIEFLY

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:17.186
TOUCH ON WHAT I MEAN BY ALLYING

00:59:17.253 --> 00:59:19.722
WITH MEDICARE. FIRST OF ALL

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:21.291
WHAT OTHER GEOGRAPHIES HOW WE

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:22.892
DIVIDE TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:24.627
WELL WE USE ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:26.663
WILL WE USE THAT THE NINETEEN

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.598
COVERED CALIFORNIA REGIONS- I

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:31.501
WOULD NOT I WOULD ADOPT WHAT.

00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:34.337
WHAT CMS ADOPTED A WHICH ARE

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.072
VERY CAREFULLY THROUGH A

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:38.107
PROCESS A DERIVED BY THE OFFICE

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:42.912
OF. MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET IT

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.347
HAS TO VIED CAL INTO A PROXY

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:46.149
TWENTY TO CHARTER. BASED ON-

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:47.517
THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE WE'RE

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:50.787
THE ONLY STATE WHERE THE PART A

00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:53.690
FACILITY ARE. ICING STRUCTURE

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:55.191
AND THE PART B. PHYSICIAN AND

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:57.160
OUTPATIENT- GEOGRAPHIES ARE

00:59:57.226 --> 00:59:59.195
ALIGNED I RECOMMEND THAT WE

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.397
ADOPT DOES GEOGRAPHY FOR

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.800
EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO GEOGRAPHY

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:06.169
CONSISTS OF YOLO EL DORADO

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:08.271
CLASSROOMS SACRAMENTO. AND

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.340
SONOMA CONSIST OF ITS OWN

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.574
GEOGRAPHY AND THE MEDICARE FEE

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:13.743
SCHEDULE PROGRAM SAN FRANCISCO

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:16.245
AND SAN MATTEO AND MY TALKED

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.880
ABOUT WHAT THAT MARKET AND HOW

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.415
SAN MATTEO RELIES ON SAN

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.184
FRANCISCO HOSPITALS THAT MARKET

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.619
IS ONE GEOGRAPHY. OF THE SECOND

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.521
THE POINT IS HOW DO WE SET

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.725
RATES BASED ON A COST INPUTS.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:31.227
SAMSCLUB AREA HAS THE MOST

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:31.861
EXPENSIVE HEALTHCARE MARKET IN

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.629
THE COUNTRY- THE MEDICARE

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:35.798
PROGRAM ANNUALLY MEASURES THE

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:38.201
COST TO DELIVER CARE IN EACH OF

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:39.369
ITS FOUR HUNDRED GEOGRAPHIES

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:41.304
AROUND THE COUNTRY THE BAY AREA

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.673
IS THE HIGHEST ALMOST DOUBLE

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.675
WHAT THE AVERAGE COST TO

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:48.378
DELIVER A HOSPITAL SERVICE. FOR

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.079
AMERICA'S MEDICARE POPULATION

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.714
WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:53.082
SHOULD SHOULD FOLLOW AND

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.752
TRACKED AND ADOPT REGIONAL

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.587
RATES. BASED ON WHAT IT COSTS

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.288
TO CARE FOR PATIENTS THE SINGLE

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:01.791
BEST SOURCE OF THAT DATA IS THE

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.493
ANNUALLY PRODUCED MEDICARE

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.161
HOSPITAL WAGE INDEX AND I

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:06.662
RECOMMEND THAT WE USE THAT IN

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:08.664
THE RIGHT SETTING. RISK

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.967
ADJUSTMENT IS AS MYERS SAID

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:13.836
ANOMALY IMPORTANT I'M STRUCK BY

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.738
I'M A I'M A COMMISSIONER ON THE

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:16.839
CENTER CALL FOR AN ALLIANCE FOR

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.441
HEALTH WE HAVE. SANTA CRUZ

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.976
MONTEREY AND MERCED COUNTY I'M

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.377
STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THE

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:23.579
HIGHEST OXIDATION RATES IN

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.048
THOSE THREE COUNTIES FOR CODE

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:26.649
ORANGE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. BUT

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.317
THE CAT WHICH HAS THE LEAST

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:30.420
COVERT PENETRATION AND HAS HAD

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:32.588
THE GREATEST SUCCESS BECAUSE OF

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:34.457
THE DEMOGRAPHICS AS COMPARED TO

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.792
MERCED COUNTY WHICH HAS THE

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.027
LOWEST VACCINATION RATE AND HAS

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.996
THE GREATEST DISEASE BURDEN.

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:42.265
AND HOW DO WE RISK ADJUST WELL

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:44.133
RISK ADJUSTMENT IS WHAT IT IS

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.637
ALREADY USED FOR ALL OF THE 40%

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.272
OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICARE

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:50.173
BENEFICIARIES THAT ARE MEDICARE

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:52.008
ADVANTAGE. THERE IS UP THE

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:55.044
PHYSICIANS ARE OR WELL ADAPTED

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:56.012
TO THE RISK ADJUSTMENT

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.914
METHODOLOGY USED IN AN MBA

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.283
PROGRAM IT IS THE SAME RISK

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:02.018
ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY WE USE

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.454
IN COVERED CALIFORNIA WHERE WE

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.988
A RISK ADJUSTER CROSSED THE

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:08.291
COMMERCIAL PLANS. THE CARE FOR

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.292
CERTAIN THE HETEROGENEOUS

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.160
POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA IN

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.962
FACT OVER BILLION DOLLARS MOVES

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:16.065
FROM OF A PLAN THAT CARES FOR

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.468
LESS SICK CALIFORNIANS TO

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.336
ANOTHER PLAN WHICH CARES FOR

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.538
THE SICK POPULATION. THE RISK

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.707
ADJUSTMENT TOOL IS BUILT FROM

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.909
THE PATIENT WE ACTUALLY MEASURE

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.678
RISK IS DEFINED BY THE

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:30.446
DIAGNOSIS CODES OF THE PATIENTS

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:32.882
IT'S ENTIRELY APPLICABLES TO

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.917
THE MEDICARE POPULATION. AND IT

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.652
AND IN FACT WE COULD ENHANCE IT

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:15.984
DESCRIBE IN OUR- REPORT- KELLY

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:19.221
PROPOSALS RELATED TO SENIORS

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:20.856
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:23.859
ON THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:26.094
CARE FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:29.264
WITH DISABILITIES- STDS IS A

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:32.200
HIGHLY FRAGMENTED. AND THAT'S

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:33.935
THE CASE BOTH FOR THROUGH THE

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:37.105
LANDSCAPE- A PROGRAM SUCH AS- I

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:40.208
HSS AND- AT PACE AND SO ON BUT

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.244
ALSO FOR- FRAGMENTATION

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:46.214
BETWEEN. MEDIC HAL AND MEDICARE

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:49.417
SO. WE TO THINK THAT- THE

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:50.452
DECENT PROPOSAL COULD

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:51.653
POTENTIALLY IMPROVE

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.822
COORDINATION BETWEEN MEDICARE

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.257
AND MEDICARE FOR THE SENIOR

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:57.259
POPULATION AND THAT THE DUAL

01:19:57.325 --> 01:19:59.961
ELIGIBLE POPULATION BUT THERE

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:01.796
ARE POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:04.132
BETWEEN THE SCALABILITY OF THE

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:07.269
D. STEP MODEL AND THE LEVEL OF

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:09.971
COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION.

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:12.040
THAT DISTANCE WOULD OFFER AND

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.608
THERE'S ALSO- SOME QUESTIONS

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:14.943
REGARDING THE LEVEL OF

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:17.245
STANDARDISATION STATEWIDE THAT

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.514
WOULD BE POSSIBLE. NOW THAT THE

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:20.715
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FROM THE

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.417
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T REALLY

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:24.753
SPECIFY WHAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:26.855
BE REQUIRED OF THE STEPS AND

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.657
BECAUSE THE STATE IS GOING TO

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.792
BE SETTING UP A DECENT CONTRACT

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:32.694
TERMS UNDER CAL AIM- THIS COULD

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.563
BE A POSSIBILITY THIS COULD BE

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:35.664
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:38.533
LEGISLATURE TO. THINK ABOUT-

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.368
WHAT SORT OF TERMS AND WHAT

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:42.037
REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE IMPOSED

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:44.706
ON ANTI STEPS ONE MORE ONE MORE

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:48.243
COMMENT- WHICH IS- THAT. IT A

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:52.013
AND- HOW VIABLE IT IS TO TAKE

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.516
THE STEPS STATEWIDE INTO INTO

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.518
EVERY COUNTY AND WHAT SORT OF A

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:59.221
POLICY OR FISCAL INCENTIVES.

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:02.324

THAT'S JUST SOMETHING ELSE THAT

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:09.497

OVERSIGHT ROLE FOR THE

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.221
DEPARTMENT AND- IT. ACCOUNT AND

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:35.156
EVALUATE OF THIS PER. THIS IS A

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:37.458
ANOTHER PRIMARY- OVERSIGHT. OF

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:39.661
PLANS DO USE THAT SHE INCLUDE

01:26:39.727 --> 01:26:40.995
HIM DATA THAT THAT MEASURE

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:42.297
WHETHER MEDICARE ALLEN THESE

01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:44.432
THAT PLANS ARE CONNECTING TOOLS

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:46.601
TO NEEDED LONG TERM SERVICES

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:47.235
AND SUPPORTS AND DOING SO

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:50.104
EQUITABLY. LTSS UTILIZATION IS

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:53.207
THAT JUST REFERENCE THIS- IS A

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:56.778
VERY COMPLEX AND- FRAGMENTED

01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:58.680
SYSTEM AND SO THE COORDINATION

01:26:58.746 --> 01:27:00.248
OF THAT LTSS UTILIZATION THE

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.849
REFERRALS. I'M EVEN

01:27:01.916 --> 01:27:04.185
EXPENDITURES- INCLUDING

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:05.219
EXPENDITURES ON HOME AND

01:27:05.286 --> 01:27:06.821
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES REALLY

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.623
MUST BE MONITORED AND TRACKED

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:11.392
VERY CLOSELY- ADDITIONALLY

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.261
EARLIER REFERENCE TO YOU KNOW

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:15.263
BROAD BASED DEMOGRAPHICS DATA

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:16.264
COLLECTION AND I THINK THAT'S

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:17.599
REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I ONLY

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.067
JUST COLLECTING INFORMATION.

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:22.070
BUT SELECTING AND SYNTHESIZING

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:23.137
THAT INFORMATION WITH LOCATION

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:25.840
DATA- SO THAT WE CAN REALLY

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.241
TRACK THE INTERSECTION I'LL BE

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:30.044
BETWEEN- DISPARITIES. AB OF HOW

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.946
PEOPLE ACCESS CARE AND THEN

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:34.816
REALLY SAID AS BENCHMARKS- FOR

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.384
PLANS TO HELP REDUCE THOSE

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:38.586
REDUCE THOSE EFFORTS. RELATEDLY

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:39.721
THE PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:41.823
PROCESS AS WELL AS THE- CARE TO

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:42.924
LIVE AS WELL AS THE CARE

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:44.926
DELIVERY- PROCESS MUST

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.661
PRIORITIZE REDUCING THESE

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:50.031
DISPARITIES- SB EQUITY CENTER-

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.499
DURING THE CCI DEMONSTRATION

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:53.267
PROCESS THE RED NUMBER OF

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:55.303
DISPARITIES THAT CAME TO BEAR-

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:56.304
AT IN TERMS OF WHO

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.206
PARTICIPATED. IN THE COMEDY

01:27:58.272 --> 01:28:04.946
CONNECT PROGRAM WHO OPTED OUT.

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.114
AT YOU PART. THERE THERE WERE

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.249
EFFORTS TO ENGAGE. AND RELATE

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:09.851
TO NEW YORK I CAN OF AND L. E.

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:12.053
P. COMMUNITY. HOWEVER THAT THAT

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.454
WASN'T ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL AND SO

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:16.424
WE SAW HUGE- MASS OPT OUT OF

01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:18.926
DISTINCT- EXCUSE OF COLOR IN

01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:20.194
THE TO BE GOOD FOR FISHING

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:22.130
PATIENTS THAT REALLY COULD HAVE

ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:26.888
MEDI CAL ON THESE FOLKS ARE

THE RATE OF. DUE TO COLDER IS

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:00.354
THREE TIMES HIGHER FOR DAHLE

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.089
DOUBLES COMPARED TO THE GENERAL

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:04.225
MEDICARE POPULATION. YES HE

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.294
SAID THE OF DUELS ARE FORWARD

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.662
AND MORE LIKELY TO BE PEOPLE OF

AND THE NEEDS OF DUAL ELIGIBLES

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:25.713
WAS A WAS A MAJOR FOCUS FOR US.

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.014
ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WAS

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:28.316
CALLING FOR PLANS AND WE

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:29.817
RECOGNIZE THAT BUSINESS IT'S

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:32.053
GOING TO HAPPEN QUICKLY. REALLY

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:34.355
A LONG TERM PLAN TO GUARANTEE

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:35.990
THAT THERE WILL BE INTEGRATED

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:37.225
OPTIONS EVERY PART OF THE

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.594
STATE. OFFER DUAL ELIGIBLES

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.596
REACH COULD BE CASE PROGRAMS.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.598
SOMETHING LIKE HOW MANY CONNECT

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:45.032
BUT BETTER WE'RE TRULY

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:48.069
INTEGRATED DUAL ELIGIBLE

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:48.936
SPECIAL NEEDS PLANTS. THIS

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:50.838
RECOMMENDATION ALSO SPEECH THAT

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:52.406
GEOGRAPHIC INEQUITIES IN THE

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:54.375
STATE MANY RURAL PARTS THE

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:56.410
STATE FARM HELP ABSOLUTE ALL

01:31:56.477 --> 01:31:59.547
AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF OPTIONS

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:03.684
FOR- RANGES FROM LTSS OPTIONS

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:05.720
TWO OPTIONS FOR INTEGRATED CARE.

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:07.121
BUT EVEN IN URBAN AREAS THERE

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:11.325
ARE MAJOR PROBLEMS- AND- AND

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:12.760
THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY CRITICAL

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:16.397
WHY. I SUPPORT THE STATE'S

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.000
REQUIREMENTS THAT THE DIS NEXT

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:21.168
REALLY BE ONLINE AS THEY CALL

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:24.205
IT- I DO ARGUE THAT THERE'S TOO

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:24.772
MUCH CHOICE ON THE MEDICARE

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:27.608
SIDE. I'M SIXTY FIVE AND I'VE

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:29.510
BEEN A BOMBARDED WITH MAIL

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:30.311

ADVANTAGE PLANS IN LOS ANGELES

01:32:32.613 --> 01:32:33.481
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MORE

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.616
THAN NINETY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:37.818
OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE ALL THESE

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:39.220

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:42.223
PLANS- INCLUDE TOOLS AND THEIR

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.057
MARKETING WHETHER INTENTIONALLY

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:45.359
OR NOT. AT TIMES IT'S VERY

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:47.628
MISSILE VERY MISLEADING AND

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:49.530
CONFUSING FOR DOOR MEMBERS

01:32:49.597 --> 01:32:51.399
OFFER DAHLE BENEFICIARIES SO

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:53.367
WHAT WE REALLY NEED I THINK IS

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:54.769
A CURATED CHOICE AND LONG

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:56.971
DISTANCE WITH THE COLLEGE THAT.

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:58.239
AGAIN THERE MAY BE FEWER

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:00.274
CHOICES FOR DUAL ELIGIBLES BUT

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:03.077
IT WOULD BE REAL MEANS SO- DO A

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.578
LOT OF TROUBLES AND AGAIN UNDER

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.580
THIS PROPOSAL THEY CAN STAY IN

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:08.015

OR MAKING PEOPLE OF ROLE IN R.

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:13.688
D. STEPS AGAINST DAVIES FOR

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:15.623
SERVICE WORK ON THEY WOULD HAVE

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:17.625
AT LEAST ONE TRULY INTEGRATED

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:26.100
MEDICARE MEDICAID PLANS. ON. IF

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:26.667
THAT'S WHAT THE AND WHAT WE

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:28.536
WANT. I'M ANOTHER KEY. OF AND

01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:29.637
OTHER OF TOUCH ON ON THIS IS

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:31.739
WHAT IS TRULY. TRUE INTEGRATION

01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:32.840
GO BEYOND JUST INTEGRATE

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.842
MEDICARE MEDI CAL BENEFITS-

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:36.544
THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:38.312
IT MEANS INTEGRATING OR CLOSE

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:39.947
COORDINATION OF HEALTH WITH

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.682
LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

01:33:41.749 --> 01:33:44.085
WITH BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES.

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.386
AND OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.854
SUCH AS HOUSING AND FOOD

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:49.623
AVAILABILITY. THE STATE SHOULD

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:50.491
ENSURE THAT THE ALIGNED YOU

STEPS ARE HIGHLY INTEGRATED AS

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:54.562
POSSIBLE. SO JUST ONE EXAMPLE

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.066
VERYLEAST ANY ONLINE DO YOU

STEP ON PASSED TO TAKE

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:01.702
RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOTH

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:03.771
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDED

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:05.906
LONG TERM CARE. IS NOT THE

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:07.908
DISTANCE WILL HAVE NO INCENTIVE

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:09.810
TO HELP PEOPLE AVOID LONG TERM

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.979
NURSING HOME STATES. SO UNDER

01:34:12.046 --> 01:34:13.014
FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CHAO MANY

OUR MEMBERS MOVE OUT OF NURSING

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.188
HOMES AND THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.723
BECAUSE WE ARE RESPONSIBILITY

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:24.825
FOR LONG TERM CARE- AND

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:27.495

INTEGRATED MEDICARE MEDI CAL

01:34:34.468 --> 01:34:38.205
CARE CAN HAVE. SO TODAY 55% H.

01:34:38.272 --> 01:34:41.275
P. S. M.'S ELIGIBLE- CAL MANY

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.009
CONNECT TOOLS HAVE BEEN

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:43.978
VACCINATED- WE THINK THAT'S

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.446
GOOD PROGRESS BUT IT'S STILL

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:47.948
LOWER THAN THE 75% FRACTION

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:49.683
VACCINATION RATE FOR THE SIXTY

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.852
FIVE PLUS. GENERAL POPULATION

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:59.860
IN THE COUNTY OVERALL- AND IT

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:00.661
WE THINK IT'S GOOD PRICE

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:01.595
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ALL BUT

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:03.130

OTHER CHALLENGES. AND THE

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:09.336
REASON WE CAN MAKE THIS KIND OF

01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:10.471
PROGRESS IS BECAUSE THESE

A DIVERSE GROUP OF SENIORS- WHO

KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF NURSING

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:07.054
HOMES. AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:08.022
THE FOUNDATION OF OUR

01:37:08.088 --> 01:37:11.525
ORGANIZATION WE NOW SERVE ABOUT

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:12.092

BOTH WORLDS AS THE PHYSICIAN

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:36.483
EARLIER WE'RE SPEAKING TO. ALL

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:37.618
OF THE MEDICARE AND THE

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:46.227
MEDICAID. OUTSIDE YOU KNOW A

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:47.895
MULTI SET OF CALL MEASURES- WE

QUALITY PLAN AVAILABLE TO THEM

01:37:59.106 --> 01:37:59.740
AND TO THE POINT THAT THE

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:01.175
POSITION WAS MAKING EARLIER ONE

01:38:01.242 --> 01:38:03.244
OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE- OF

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.679
OUR STRONG PROVIDER NETWORK SO

01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:06.947
PROVIDERS JUST NEED TO PROVIDE

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:09.650
CARE. WE DO ALL THE REST IN THE

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:11.051
FACT HE'S NEVER WHICH IS THE

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:13.354
WRAPAROUND SERVICES. INCLUDING

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.722
THE INTEGRATED LONG TERM

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:16.690
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND WHAT

01:38:16.757 --> 01:38:18.525
THAT'S BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER IT

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:21.328
IS LESS THAN 1% OF OUR DUAL

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:23.764
ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES ARE.

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:24.865
ENROLLED IN A LONG TERM CARE

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:27.134
FACILITY AND THOSE NUMBERS THAT

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:29.403
MIGHT WAS MENTIONING BE ADAMANT

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:30.838
RELATED TO CODE BUT A LOT OF

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:32.306
THAT HAS TO DO WITH FOLKS WHO

01:38:32.373 --> 01:38:34.241
WERE LIVING IN LONG TERM CARE

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:38.846
FACILITIES. AND OUR- YOU KNOW

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:40.581
OUR- RIGHT AFTER I READ FOR

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:42.316
BEING IS TO KEEP SENIORS LIVING

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:43.951
HEALTHY AND INDEPENDENTLY IN

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:45.719
THE COMMUNITY. AND YOU HAVE TO

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:48.989
DO THAT BY. FULLY INTEGRATING.

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:50.824
THEIR WHOLE PERSON NEEDS WHICH

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.793
IS WHY I LOVE THE WHOLE PERSON

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.261
MODEL I LOVE WITH THE STATE IS

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:56.930
DOING WITH COUNTING- WHAT DH CS

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:59.133
IS TRYING TO DO AND THE MANY

01:38:59.199 --> 01:38:59.667
STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY'RE

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:02.102
BRINGING TOGETHER. I'M STILL

01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:03.070
ONE LESSON WE DID LEARN FROM

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:04.638
THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.573
WAS THAT PROVIDERS ARE KEY

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.275
STAKEHOLDERS AND THEY INFLUENCE

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:10.411
BENEFICIARY CHOICE. AND SO WE

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:12.146
HAVE TO WORK WITH A PRODUCT

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.781
THAT HAS STRONG PARTNERSHIP

01:39:13.847 --> 01:39:15.983
WITH THOSE PROVIDERS- AND

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:17.284
ENABLES THEM TO YOU AS THE

01:39:17.351 --> 01:39:18.752
DOCTOR SAID DELIVER CARE

01:39:18.819 --> 01:39:20.187
REGARDLESS OF THE BENEFICIARIES

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:25.292
COVERAGE THEY JUST KNOW. THAT.

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:25.826
THEY NEED TO PROVIDE HIGH

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:26.794
QUALITY CARE. I KNOW LESSON WE

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:27.828
LEARNED IS THAT BENEFITS

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:30.264
CHOICES IMPORTANT SO I'M TO THE

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:31.498
POINT AT THAT THE LEGAL AID

01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:33.233
SOCIETY WAS MAKING. THERE WAS A

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.803
LOT OF. BENEFITS RETURNED WHERE

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.471
FOLKS WERE DISTANT ROLLING FROM

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:41.208
THEIR ASSIGNED PLANS- WE SAW.

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.376
AMAZING STABILITY IN OUR

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:43.944
MEMBERSHIP THROUGH THIS-

01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:46.847
TRANSITION BECAUSE WE ARE FULLY

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:48.916
INTEGRATED BECAUSE WE PROVIDE

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:50.784
GOOD SERVICES BUT ALSO BECAUSE

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:51.985
OF THE BENEFITS FREE CHOICE

01:39:52.052 --> 01:39:53.821
WHEN THEY WHEN THEY HAD.

01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:56.323
INTEGRATED OPTION- THAT MY IT

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.957
WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THE

01:39:57.024 --> 01:39:58.759
COUNTIES WE SERVE I'M IN THIS

01:39:58.826 --> 01:39:59.727
IS A GREAT OPTION ISN'T

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:01.762
RIVERSIDE SAMBAR DINO AND LOS

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:04.331
ANGELES COUNTIES. I'M WITH

01:40:04.398 --> 01:40:06.066
RESPECT TO THE LTSS OF

01:40:06.133 --> 01:40:08.402
DELEGATION- THAT ANASTASIA WAS

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:10.838
TALKING ABOUT SO OUR MODEL HAS

01:40:10.904 --> 01:40:13.507
BEEN FULLY INTEGRATED- AND NOT

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:14.775
ONLY HASN'T ALLOWED US TO

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:15.476
ACHIEVE THOSE LOW

01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:17.177
INSTITUTIONALIZATION RATES THAT

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:18.879
I TALKED ABOUT THAT LESS THAN

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:20.314
ONE PERCENT. BUT WE'VE ALSO

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:21.849
BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE LOWER

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:23.984
ACUTE UTILIZATION LOWER

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:25.753
READMISSION AND SO WHAT THIS

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:27.588
MODEL DOES IT CREATE SAVINGS

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:29.456
FOR BOTH MEDIC HOW AS WELL AS

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:32.459
MEDICARE. I'M SO NOT ONLY IS IT

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.927
YOU KNOW MODEL THAT PRODUCES

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:40.267
HIGH QUALITY OUTCOMES IT. ALSO

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:41.902

THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES HAVE

01:57:28.775 --> 01:57:30.810
MERIT AND DEATH THAT IT THAT

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:32.912
IT. LINKS BACK TO THE CORE

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:34.247
MISSION OF CALAIS AND THAT IT

01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:36.382

01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:44.190
THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF

01:57:44.257 --> 01:57:45.658
WHETHER IT COULD CREATE A STATE

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:47.960

PREPARED TO SAY THAT IT WOULD

01:57:51.497 --> 01:57:52.832
CREATE A STATE MANDATE BUT IT

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:55.468
IS SOMETHING TO POTENTIALLY

SO NOT ACTUALLY BEGINNING THIS-

02:18:03.908 --> 02:18:06.945
IMPLEMENTABLE OF THE PROCESS-

02:18:07.012 --> 02:18:09.514

TO BE SURE THAT THAT HAS BEEN

02:18:28.099 --> 02:18:30.935

PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE

02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:24.355
IMPLEMENTED PRIOR TO THE

02:19:24.422 --> 02:19:25.857
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO THE

02:22:54.666 --> 02:22:55.900
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:22:55.967 --> 02:22:57.335
COMMENTS ABOUT FROM DIRECTOR MY

02:22:57.402 --> 02:22:59.103
BORN ON THE TINY. AND AGREED

02:22:59.170 --> 02:23:00.371
THAT COUNTY SO NOT BE PUBLIC

02:23:00.438 --> 02:23:02.240
PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:04.976
CURRENT CASELOAD. GIVEN THE- P.

02:23:05.043 --> 02:23:06.644
EIGHTY FIVE. OR THE TIME WHEN

02:23:06.711 --> 02:23:08.780
WE STARTED BIG OUT AFTER THAT

02:23:08.846 --> 02:23:10.648
BOB HOPE EMERGENCY IS LIFTED.

02:23:10.715 --> 02:23:11.950
AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE

02:23:12.016 --> 02:23:13.785
CONSIDERATION OF HOW TO WORK

02:23:13.851 --> 02:23:15.753
WITH. THAT UPCOMING CHALFONT

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:16.821
MIGRATION WHICH OF COURSE IS

02:23:16.888 --> 02:23:18.756
FEDERALLY REQUIRED. AND WILL

02:23:18.823 --> 02:23:21.426
RESULT IN SOME OFF WALKS OF

02:23:21.492 --> 02:23:23.594
CASES LATELY AS WE SORT OF MOVE

02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:25.496
BETWEEN THE SYSTEM. OF COURSE

02:23:25.563 --> 02:23:30.902
WE ILL ATTEMPT AND ALWAYS. O

02:23:30.969 --> 02:23:31.502
MINIMIZE THAT TO THE GREATEST

02:23:31.569 --> 02:23:32.136
EXTENT POSSIBLE. WE HAVE ASKED

02:23:32.203 --> 02:23:32.770
FOR A INFORMATION FROM OTHER.

02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:34.172
OF IT THINKING REGARDING THE

02:23:34.238 --> 02:23:35.740
PUBLIC POSTING OF COUNTY

02:23:35.807 --> 02:23:38.042
PERFORMANCE DETAILS. ITSELF MAY

02:23:38.109 --> 02:23:39.544
NOT JUST BE MOST LIMITED TO THE

02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:41.479
EXISTING MEASURES BUT WE'RE NOT

02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:42.413
CLEAR ON WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE

02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:43.748
INCLUDED. I THINK IT'S

02:23:43.815 --> 02:23:44.882
IMPORTANT TO GET CLARITY ON

02:23:44.949 --> 02:23:46.017
THAT BEFORE ANY SUCH CHANGES

02:23:46.084 --> 02:23:47.585
THAT HAPPENED ON THAT SHOOT.

02:23:47.652 --> 02:23:48.820
ATTORNEYS UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL

02:23:48.886 --> 02:23:51.055
BE EXPECTED ABOUT. THAT I WILL

02:23:51.122 --> 02:23:52.256
ALSO SEND A PRIOR SYSTEM WAS

02:23:52.323 --> 02:23:53.625
CREATED QUITE AWHILE AGO AND

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:55.193
BEFORE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:56.728
AMOUNT OF DATA WAS ACTUALLY ON

02:23:56.794 --> 02:23:58.396
THE INTERNET AND AVAILABLE. SO

02:23:58.463 --> 02:23:59.831
UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT MIGHT BE

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:04.168
SHOWN AND HOW OFTEN. THAT MIGHT

02:24:04.235 --> 02:24:04.669
BE UPDATED IS ALSO VERY

02:24:04.736 --> 02:24:05.603
IMPORTANT. I ALSO LIKE TO

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:06.537
FURTHER HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR

02:24:06.604 --> 02:24:08.773
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR PHD AT.

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.108
THE MEDICAL PROGRAM HAS

02:24:10.174 --> 02:24:11.676
UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM

02:24:11.743 --> 02:24:13.311
CHANGES ESPECIALLY WITH THE

02:24:13.378 --> 02:24:17.615
ACA. I THINK- AS I AS WAS NOTED

02:24:17.682 --> 02:24:19.550
THAT CAL AIM PROPOSAL WILL

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:21.853
CREATE A VERY SIGNIFICANT. PART

02:24:21.919 --> 02:24:23.121
OF CHANGES TO OUR MEDIC HEALTH

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:25.723
SYSTEM. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IN

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:27.291
TWENTY YEARS IN THIS JOB. THE

02:24:27.358 --> 02:24:28.693
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:31.329
ELIGIBILITY. HAD THE BIGGEST

02:24:31.396 --> 02:24:33.931
IMPACT WE HAVE JUST SEEN SO

02:24:33.998 --> 02:24:35.767
MANY CHANGES. AND I WILL

02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:36.634
MENTION THAT WE'VE NOT HAD AN

02:24:36.701 --> 02:24:38.469
UPDATED REGULATIONS PACKAGE OF

02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:40.071
MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND

02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:41.806
ELIGIBILITY. SO WHAT WE HAVE IS

02:24:41.873 --> 02:24:43.574
A CONTINUUM OF LETTERS THAT

02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:44.776
COUNTY THE FEDERAL LAND OF

02:24:44.842 --> 02:24:46.744
THAT. IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT

02:24:46.811 --> 02:24:48.079
FOR STAFF TO THREAD THE NEEDLE

02:24:48.146 --> 02:24:49.147
BETWEEN MULTIPLE I'LL COUNTY

02:24:49.213 --> 02:24:50.681
LETTERS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH A

02:24:50.748 --> 02:24:52.717
PARTICULAR SITUATION. AND THIS

02:24:52.784 --> 02:24:53.751
CAN LEAD TO CONFUSION AND

02:24:53.818 --> 02:24:54.986
UNINTENDED DELAYS IN

02:24:55.053 --> 02:24:56.587
ELIGIBILITY OR OTHER ERRORS

02:24:56.654 --> 02:24:57.655
THAT WOULD BE AFFORDABLE FOR

02:24:57.722 --> 02:24:59.891
CLARITY. SO WOULD LIKE TO ASK

02:24:59.957 --> 02:25:00.858
THAT THE STATE WORK WITH

02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:02.260
COUNTIES TO ADDRESS. BOTH

02:25:02.326 --> 02:25:04.395
COMMON ISSUES THAT WE THREE I'M

02:25:04.462 --> 02:25:04.862
TRYING TO IMPROVE THE

02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:05.997
COHESIVENESS OF OUR

02:25:06.064 --> 02:25:07.265
INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNTIES WHICH

02:25:07.331 --> 02:25:09.300
IS REALLY CRITICAL. AND FINALLY

02:25:09.367 --> 02:25:10.401
I JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT

02:25:10.468 --> 02:25:11.836
EXISTING STATUTE OF THE

02:25:11.903 --> 02:25:12.904

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:14.505
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. AS

COUNTY PENALTIES. WITH THE

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:18.476
BENEFIT OF TIME WE HAVE THE

HE MEASURES OVER TIME. WITH

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:31.155
SUCH PROPHECIES WHEN THEY ARE

02:25:31.222 --> 02:25:32.423
COUPLED WITH THAT PUBLIC

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:33.891

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

02:25:44.168 --> 02:25:46.070

THIS GOAL TO IN HOUSE ENHANCE

COUNTY ELIGIBILITY OVERSIGHT

02:26:24.675 --> 02:26:26.377
MONITORING- AND THAT'S BECAUSE

02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:27.778
AND MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY IS

02:26:27.845 --> 02:26:29.747
DONE RIGHT. MILLIONS OF

02:26:29.814 --> 02:26:31.182
CALIFORNIANS GET THE HEALTHCARE

02:26:31.249 --> 02:26:34.085
THEY NEED AND ARE ELIGIBLE FOR.

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:35.086
AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THE

02:26:35.153 --> 02:26:36.821
APARTMENT YELLING YELL AT THAT

02:26:36.888 --> 02:26:38.856
COUNTIES RECOGNIZE THE

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:39.690
MONUMENTAL CHANGES IN THE

ACCOUNT OR CARD OVER THE PAST

02:26:41.159 --> 02:26:42.793
DECADE I ADD TO THE LIST THAT

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.562
WE'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH- CAR

02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:45.663
WONDERFUL HEALTH FOR ALL

02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:46.931
EXPANSIONS FORCE GOVERNMENT

02:26:46.998 --> 02:26:47.899
ACCOUNT TO KIDS AND YOUNG

02:26:47.965 --> 02:26:48.866
ADULTS REGARDLESS OF

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:50.835
IMMIGRATION STATUS. I ALSO WANT

02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:51.936
TO NOTE THAT ARE CAL SUCH

02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:53.337
TRANSITION IS NOT LIKELY TO BE

02:26:53.404 --> 02:26:56.474
COMPLETE UNTIL MID TO LATE

02:26:56.541 --> 02:26:57.074
TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THEN-

02:26:57.141 --> 02:26:59.710
YEAH PANDEMICS AND MUCH MORE

02:26:59.777 --> 02:27:00.745
HAS CHANGED SINCE THESE

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:01.712
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:03.848
ORIGINALLY ENACTED. AND SO NOW

02:27:03.915 --> 02:27:06.217
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

02:27:06.284 --> 02:27:07.752
OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING

02:27:07.818 --> 02:27:10.922
PROPOSAL. IS BROADER THAN

02:27:10.988 --> 02:27:12.590
SIMPLY ADDRESSING WHAT WAS

02:27:12.657 --> 02:27:14.192
DETERMINED TO BE THE PRIORITIES

02:27:14.258 --> 02:27:16.661
IN YEARS PAST AND BROADER THAN

02:27:16.727 --> 02:27:18.529
SIMPLY ADDRESSING PASSED AUDIT

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:21.132
FINDINGS AND THAT IT DOES NOT

02:27:21.199 --> 02:27:24.068
FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON COUNTY

02:27:24.135 --> 02:27:31.375
ACTIONS. HERE'S WHAT. MORMON

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:33.511
STANDARDS ASTOR AND THE BAND

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:34.712
ALERT MONITORING PRODUCT AS WE-

02:27:34.779 --> 02:27:37.448
THAT OUR WAR. AFTER BUT THEY-

02:27:37.515 --> 02:27:39.083
THOSE MY CHANGES TO MEDICAL.

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:40.818
AND THE ALSO FROM THE- PER. DO

02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:43.187
NOT COMPREHENSIVELY MEASURE OR

02:27:43.254 --> 02:27:45.556
MONITOR THE MOST COMMON DAY ARE

02:27:45.623 --> 02:27:47.124
YOURS AND OBSTACLES THE

02:27:47.191 --> 02:27:51.262
CALIFORNIANS FACE. ONE MEDIC

02:27:51.329 --> 02:27:52.496
COUNTY IS A ROW ISLEY DID NIGHT

02:27:52.563 --> 02:27:55.399
DISK. OR IT AND WORDS WHEN

02:27:55.466 --> 02:27:59.170
PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE IN

02:27:59.237 --> 02:28:00.738
ERROR. SO LIKE THE LEGISLATURE

02:28:00.805 --> 02:28:03.140
ASKED TODAY AT THE AGENDA WE

02:28:03.207 --> 02:28:04.141
ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING THE

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:06.110
DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED WITH THE

02:28:06.177 --> 02:28:08.346
LEGISLATURE COUNTIES ADVOCATES

02:28:08.412 --> 02:28:09.614
AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.048
ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AND

02:28:11.115 --> 02:28:12.416
MONITORING TO PROTECT AND

02:28:12.483 --> 02:28:14.719
GUARANTEE ACCURATE AND TIMELY

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:17.421
MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY. CHECK THIS

02:28:17.488 --> 02:28:19.523
ONE EXAMPLE AFTER THIS CALL THE

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:21.425
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HANDS

02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:22.860
MOST OF THE CURRENT THIRTEEN

02:28:22.927 --> 02:28:23.594
MILLION PLUS MEDICARE

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:25.863
BENEFICIARIES WILL BE SUBJECT

02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:27.565
AGAIN TO ANNUAL RENEWABLES.

02:28:27.632 --> 02:28:30.201
THAT MEANS NEARLY A MILLION

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:32.169
DETERMINATIONS EVERY MONTH PLUS

02:28:32.236 --> 02:28:33.337
NEW APPLICATIONS AND MAYBE

02:28:33.404 --> 02:28:35.206
COMING AT AND UNDER THE CURRENT

02:28:35.273 --> 02:28:37.241
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 90% OF

02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:38.542
RENEWALS MUST BE COMPLETED WHEN

02:28:38.609 --> 02:28:40.344
INFORMATION IS SUSPENDED AND

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:42.113
NOTICES SENT APPROPRIATELY.

02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:43.814
THIS MEANS THAT WOULD FIT IN A

02:28:43.881 --> 02:28:45.683
WORST CASE SCENARIO EVERY MONTH

02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:47.351
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED

02:28:47.418 --> 02:28:48.219
THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS GOOD

02:28:48.286 --> 02:28:49.620
AFTER MEDIC CALDERON EASILY CUT

02:28:49.687 --> 02:28:51.422
OFF AND UNDER OUR EXISTING

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:53.291
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ALL YOU

02:28:53.357 --> 02:28:58.529
WOULD SEE. IS A PASSING SCORE.

02:28:58.596 --> 02:28:59.664
SO THE ISSUE THE IS THAT PER

02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:01.766
STATE. THAT MEASURE IS ACTUALLY

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:03.534
HELPFUL TO GUIDE OPERATIONS AS

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:04.235
IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY

02:29:04.302 --> 02:29:06.637
TODAY. BUT IT FALLS SHORT OF

02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:07.938
WHAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS

02:29:08.005 --> 02:29:09.573
NEED TO SAMPLE WEIGHTS ALLOWS

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.108
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

02:29:11.175 --> 02:29:12.276
TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:13.878
IT DOES NOT MEASURE WHEN YOUR

02:29:13.944 --> 02:29:16.981

02:35:29.186 --> 02:35:30.854
COUNTY PARTNERS I THINK ONE

02:35:30.921 --> 02:35:32.489
THING THAT WE HAVE- IF

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:33.657

MANY WEEKS IN ORDER TO GET

IS ALSO NEEDED TO EVALUATE THIS

02:43:00.303 --> 02:43:02.072

BY DIFFERENT PROVIDERS THE

02:43:33.904 --> 02:43:35.805
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS DEPENDS

02:43:35.872 --> 02:43:36.606
ON WHETHER THE CHILD IS

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:42.112

CLOSE THE GAPS THAT WERE THERE-

02:47:29.739 --> 02:47:30.206
BEFORE COULD. AND THEN THE

02:47:30.273 --> 02:47:30.807
LARGE GAPS THAT WERE CREATED

02:47:30.874 --> 02:47:32.509
THE POP HEALTH EMERGENCY IS.

02:47:32.575 --> 02:47:34.277
THANK YOU OF FINAL A I WAS

02:47:34.344 --> 02:47:36.279
HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE

02:47:36.346 --> 02:47:39.015
NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAMS.

02:47:39.082 --> 02:47:40.583
COMMENTER QUESTION REGARDING

OVERSIGHT OF THE MEDICARE

02:47:42.152 --> 02:47:44.387
MANAGED CARE PLANS AND HOW THIS

02:47:44.454 --> 02:47:46.589
PROPOSAL WILL BE AFFECTING THE

02:47:46.656 --> 02:47:47.957
WAR IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON

02:47:48.024 --> 02:47:50.760
THAT YOUR- SO IF WE IDENTIFY

02:47:50.827 --> 02:47:52.762
ANY AREAS- THAT WOULD BE

02:47:52.829 --> 02:47:54.697
CONSISTENT ACROSS THE WHOLE

02:47:54.764 --> 02:47:56.399
CHILD MODEL AND CCS PROGRAM OF

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:58.401
COURSE WE WOULD. IMPLEMENT THAT

02:47:58.468 --> 02:48:00.103
ONE THING I WOULD SAY BECAUSE

02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:01.237
OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN

02:48:01.304 --> 02:48:02.539
MANAGED CARE THERE ARE

02:48:02.605 --> 02:48:04.340
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PROTECTIONS

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:06.609
IN PLACE FOR CHILDREN- CCS

02:48:06.676 --> 02:48:07.744
CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THE WHOLE

02:48:07.811 --> 02:48:10.146
CHILD MODEL PROGRAM THEN- IN D.

02:48:10.213 --> 02:48:12.615
AS STATE ONLY AND OR THAT THE

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:14.617
P. FOR SERVICE AS CCS PROGRAM

02:48:14.684 --> 02:48:16.619
AND SO. SOME OF THIS INITIATIVE

02:48:16.686 --> 02:48:18.588
IS ACTUALLY JUST ELEVATING TO

02:48:18.655 --> 02:48:20.790
THE SAME LEVEL OF- GRIEVANCE

02:48:20.857 --> 02:48:23.159
APPEAL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS THAT

02:48:23.226 --> 02:48:24.794
ACTUALLY EXIST AND ARE REQUIRED

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:26.496
IN MANAGED CARE AND I THINK IT

02:48:26.563 --> 02:48:28.364
BECAME VERY CLEAR TO US WITH

02:48:28.431 --> 02:48:29.632
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHOLE

02:48:29.699 --> 02:48:30.600
CHILD MODEL SOME OF THE

02:48:30.667 --> 02:48:32.268
DIFFERENCES THAT HISTORICALLY

02:48:32.335 --> 02:48:33.870
HAVE EXISTED FOR THE CCS

02:48:33.937 --> 02:48:35.672
CHILDREN. THAT HAVE BEEN CARVED

02:48:35.738 --> 02:48:38.107
OUT TO FEE FOR SERVICE- AND SO

ABLE TO APPEAL THOSE BENEFITS

02:55:49.005 --> 02:55:50.039
IF FOR SOME REASON SOMETHING

02:55:50.106 --> 02:55:52.141
WAS DENIED OR MODIFIED THAT'S

02:55:52.208 --> 02:55:53.609
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR US TO

OF THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY

02:56:01.417 --> 02:56:03.019
LOOKING TO EXPLORE ELECTRONIC

WELL AS LIKE I MENTIONED

HOW WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION

02:56:11.027 --> 02:56:13.362

OUR APPLICATION PROCESS WHICH

02:56:14.730 --> 02:56:15.698
CAN BE A CHALLENGE WE KNOW

02:56:15.765 --> 02:56:17.333
THAT'S A HUGE LIFT BUT WE DO

02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:19.302
THINK IT'S SO CRITICAL FOR US

02:56:19.368 --> 02:56:20.403

DISTURB BRIEFLY- WE FEEL THAT

02:56:49.365 --> 02:56:50.933
THIS PROPOSAL MAKES SENSE AND

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.836
CONCEPT. THAT IMPROVING THE

02:56:53.903 --> 02:56:55.938
ABILITY OF THE STATE TO

02:56:56.005 --> 02:56:57.807
CONTACT- INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD

02:56:57.873 --> 02:57:00.476
BENEFIT FROM MEDICAL SERVICES-

02:57:00.543 --> 02:57:02.044
CLEARLY IMPROVES THE ABILITY OF

02:57:02.111 --> 02:57:04.013
THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.247
THOSE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THOSE

02:57:05.314 --> 02:57:08.751
SERVICES- I WOULD ALSO NOTE

02:57:08.818 --> 02:57:11.520
THAT- ASSEMBLY WHOLE PERSON

02:57:11.587 --> 02:57:12.788
CARE ADMINISTRATORS HAVE NOTED

02:57:12.855 --> 02:57:16.192
THAT. AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE

02:57:16.258 --> 02:57:17.994
FOR THEM WAS JUST THE ABILITY

02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:18.995
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH

02:57:19.061 --> 02:57:21.030
BENEFICIARIES SO- THIS IS

02:57:21.097 --> 02:57:23.966

TIME AND- WE FEEL THAT AGAIN

02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:29.638

02:57:38.214 --> 02:57:40.049
OKAY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

02:57:40.116 --> 02:57:41.484
OF MEMBERS KATHY THUNDERWING

02:57:41.550 --> 02:57:43.152
MCDONALD WITH THE COUNTY WALKER

02:57:43.219 --> 02:57:45.454
DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. WE DO

02:57:45.521 --> 02:57:46.455
NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE

02:57:46.522 --> 02:57:48.357
PROPOSED WORKGROUP WE DO THINK

02:57:48.424 --> 02:57:50.493
AS THE SKIPPER NOTED THAT THIS

02:57:50.559 --> 02:57:52.261
IS MORE COMPLEX THAN I THINK.

02:57:52.328 --> 02:57:55.331
MAYBE ARE REALIZED ON FIRST

02:57:55.398 --> 02:57:57.333
BLUSH GIVEN THAT KEEPING

02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:02.204
PEOPLE'S ADDRESSES UP TO DATE.

02:58:02.271 --> 02:58:02.838
SOUNDS LIKE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE

02:58:02.905 --> 02:58:03.472
PASSED. BUT IT ACTUALLY NOT AS

02:58:03.539 --> 02:58:05.608
AS YOU MIGHT THINK I THINK-

02:58:05.674 --> 02:58:07.109
AGAIN THE SKIPPER GOT A GREAT

02:58:07.176 --> 02:58:08.210
JOB OF EXPLAINING THE STEPS

02:58:08.277 --> 02:58:09.879
THAT COUNTIES HAVE TO FOLLOW.

02:58:09.945 --> 02:58:12.715
THE MAIN. GOAL THOUGH IS TO

02:58:12.782 --> 02:58:15.217
ENSURE THAT WE ARE VERIFYING

02:58:15.284 --> 02:58:16.685
WITH AN INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY

02:58:16.752 --> 02:58:18.187
HAVE INDEED CHANGED THEIR

02:58:18.254 --> 02:58:19.688
ADDRESS OR OTHER CONTACT

02:58:19.755 --> 02:58:21.757
INFORMATION. BEFORE WE ACTUALLY

02:58:21.824 --> 02:58:23.392
EFFECTUATE THAT CHANGE IN OUR

02:58:23.459 --> 02:58:25.761
COMPUTER SYSTEM WHICH IS THAT

02:58:25.828 --> 02:58:27.430
NOT ONLY THE CASE MANAGEMENT

02:58:27.496 --> 02:58:28.297
SYSTEM BUT IT'S ALSO THE SYSTEM

02:58:28.364 --> 02:58:30.800
OF RECORD. FOR MEDICCAL IF WE

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:32.168
DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT-

02:58:32.234 --> 02:58:34.103
INFORMATION WE MAY LOSE CONTACT

02:58:34.170 --> 02:58:35.571
WITH THEM AND SO WE CAN'T JUST

02:58:35.638 --> 02:58:37.473
TAKE THE WORD OF SOMEONE IN A

02:58:37.540 --> 02:58:38.474
HEALTH PLAN OR SOME OTHER

02:58:38.541 --> 02:58:40.309
STORES. INTEL WE'VE HAD A

02:58:40.376 --> 02:58:41.410
CHANCE TO DOUBLE CHECK WITH

02:58:41.477 --> 02:58:43.712
THEM. THE OTHER REASON WHY IT'S

02:58:43.779 --> 02:58:44.713
SO IMPORTANT TO DO THAT IS

02:58:44.780 --> 02:58:46.615
BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED A

02:58:46.682 --> 02:58:47.149
CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND

02:58:47.216 --> 02:58:48.751
SOMEONE MOVES. THEY ARE

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:50.119
SUPPOSED TO REPORT THAT TO US

02:58:50.186 --> 02:58:52.154
WITHIN TEN DAS IF WE FIND OUT

02:58:52.221 --> 02:58:53.355
EITHER DIRECTLY FROM THEM OR

02:58:53.422 --> 02:58:54.590
THROUGH ANOTHER SOURCE SUCH AS

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:56.492
THE HEALTH PLAN REPORT. THAT

02:58:56.559 --> 02:58:57.660
APPEARANCE THEIR ADDRESSES

02:58:57.726 --> 02:58:59.528
CHANGED THE COUNTY HAS TO READ

02:58:59.595 --> 02:59:00.863
THE TERMINOLOGY ABILITY BASED

02:59:00.930 --> 02:59:02.231
ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE

02:59:02.298 --> 02:59:03.666
TERM AND- YES THEY WERE MADE

02:59:03.732 --> 02:59:06.402
ELIGIBLE OR NOT. AND SO TAKING

02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:07.069
SOMEONE ELSES WORD FOR AN

02:59:07.136 --> 02:59:09.705
ADDRESS CHANGE. ULTIMATELY LEAD

02:59:09.772 --> 02:59:12.975
TO A SET OF- SORT OF SET UP FOR

02:59:13.042 --> 02:59:14.510
OUR PROCEDURES THAT TAKE PLACE.

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:15.911
THAT COULD ULTIMATELY RESULT IN

02:59:15.978 --> 02:59:17.046
A PERSON BE BEING MADE

02:59:17.113 --> 02:59:19.081
INELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. AND

02:59:19.148 --> 02:59:20.816
SO I THINK IT'S ONE REASON TO

02:59:20.883 --> 02:59:23.352
TREAD CAREFULLY INTO THIS AREA.

02:59:23.419 --> 02:59:25.421
TO ENSURE THAT WERE BOTH

02:59:25.488 --> 02:59:26.755
ACCURATELY AND EFFICIENTLY

02:59:26.822 --> 02:59:28.858
DOING THAT BUT ALSO THAT WE'RE

02:59:28.924 --> 02:59:30.826
NOT TAKING NEGATIVE ACTIONS

02:59:30.893 --> 02:59:32.695
THAT COULD. AFFECT THE- AND

02:59:32.761 --> 02:59:33.963
INDIVIDUAL OUR FAMILIES

02:59:34.029 --> 02:59:40.703
ELIGIBILITY- WITHOUT. BEING

02:59:40.769 --> 02:59:42.204
VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. OR

02:59:42.271 --> 02:59:42.838
HEAD OF SITUATION THAT HAPPEN

02:59:42.905 --> 02:59:44.740
WITHIN THE- AND WE DON'T THAT

02:59:44.807 --> 02:59:45.808
AFTER- YOU KNOW DISCONTINUE

02:59:45.875 --> 02:59:47.176
PEOPLE ELIGIBLE UNLESS WE

02:59:47.243 --> 02:59:49.111
ABSOLUTELY. TO BECAUSE OF AN

02:59:49.178 --> 02:59:51.213
ELIGIBILITY. SO WITH THAT- WE

02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:52.915
THINK THAT THE WORKGROUP CAN

02:59:52.982 --> 02:59:55.885
HELP TO SORT OUT THOSE. KIND OF

02:59:55.951 --> 02:59:57.920
THORNY ISSUES AND IDEALLY PUT

02:59:57.987 --> 03:00:00.689
IN PLACE SOME PROCESS FEES. AND

03:00:00.756 --> 03:00:02.158
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT

03:00:02.224 --> 03:00:03.526
PARTIES THAT ARE ENGAGED AND

03:00:03.592 --> 03:00:04.426
WHEN SOMETHING WOULD BE

03:00:04.493 --> 03:00:05.895
REPORTED. HOW IT WOULD BE

03:00:05.961 --> 03:00:07.396
REPORTED AND HOW THAT THAT

03:00:07.463 --> 03:00:09.165
WOULD BE THAT ACTED UPON OR-

03:00:09.231 --> 03:00:11.267
DISPOSITION. THANKS FUNNY HAPPY

03:00:11.333 --> 03:00:12.868

DIABETES AND MENTAL HEALTH.

03:00:55.511 --> 03:00:56.679
YOU'RE JUST HEALTH DISPARITIES

03:00:56.745 --> 03:00:58.414
MEDIKAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND

03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:00.115
PROVIDERS AND THE STATE MUST

EXPLICITLY DOCUMENT AND MEASURE

03:01:01.850 --> 03:01:03.152
THE EXISTENCE OF DISPARITIES

03:01:03.219 --> 03:01:05.454
AND TARGET RESOURCES TOWARDS

03:01:05.521 --> 03:01:07.056
ELIMINATING THEM. AIMED AT THE

03:01:07.122 --> 03:01:08.958
FINAL RULE REQUIRES THE STATE

03:01:09.024 --> 03:01:10.292
TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE AND

03:01:10.359 --> 03:01:12.328
REDUCE DISPARITIES BASED ON AGE

03:01:12.394 --> 03:01:14.697

MEASURES AND THERE I HOPE

03:01:35.651 --> 03:01:37.886
DISPARITIES ANALYSIS. I'M

03:01:37.953 --> 03:01:39.888
WALDRON LP- I HAVE BEEN VERY

03:01:39.955 --> 03:01:41.624
HELPFUL IT'S BECOME CLEAR TO US

03:01:41.690 --> 03:01:44.727
AND WE- ARE AT THAT TIME. THAT

03:01:44.793 --> 03:01:46.528
THERE'S STILL A WIDE VARIATION

03:01:46.595 --> 03:01:47.863
IN DATA QUALITY AND

03:01:47.930 --> 03:01:49.231
COMPREHENSIVENESS. WHICH

03:01:49.298 --> 03:01:51.033
SERIOUSLY LIMITS THE GENERAL

03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:53.269
GENERAL GENERALIZE ABILITY OF

03:01:53.335 --> 03:01:54.837

AND YOU KNOW WHERE AND YOU KNOW

03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:00.643
A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE IS. STILL

03:02:00.709 --> 03:02:02.578
THE NORM FOR THE PLAN TO NEED

03:02:02.645 --> 03:02:03.879
TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MEMBERSHIP

03:02:03.946 --> 03:02:05.614
IT DOESN'T YIELD THE STATE YOU

03:02:05.681 --> 03:02:07.349
KNOW NEAR THE LEVEL OF DATA

03:02:07.416 --> 03:02:07.850
THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO

03:02:07.916 --> 03:02:09.418
IDENTIFY DISPARITIES. AND

03:02:09.485 --> 03:02:16.358
TARGET THE NECESSARY.

03:02:16.425 --> 03:02:17.126

MANDATORY VERSUS OPTIONAL. I'M

03:07:06.648 --> 03:07:07.449

INCREASE FROM WHERE WE WERE

03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:43.084
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. THE

ANY FURTHER INTO THOSE NUMBERS.

03:17:52.660 --> 03:17:55.363
ADDITIONALLY I'D LIKE TO NOTE

03:17:55.430 --> 03:17:57.165
THAT THE PILOT PROGRAMS TESTED

03:17:57.232 --> 03:17:58.499
IN THE DTI WERE THE FIRST TIME

03:17:58.566 --> 03:17:59.734

03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:07.242
DIRECTION FOR SEVERAL YEAR

03:18:07.308 --> 03:18:08.643
SEVERAL YEARS BUT DENTISTRY IS

03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:10.011
JUST STARTING ALONG THAT PATH

03:18:10.078 --> 03:18:11.713
AND THIS WAS A VERY INNOVATIVE

03:18:11.779 --> 03:18:13.448
PART OF THE DTI AND WILL BE

03:18:13.514 --> 03:18:15.550

IN FLORIDA AND OTHER LOW COST

03:18:23.491 --> 03:18:24.692
INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL REDUCE

03:18:24.759 --> 03:18:26.094
THE NEED FOR MORE EXPENSIVE

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:27.128
