BUILDING MORE RESERVES RELATIVE

00:32:54.238 --> 00:33:00.511

FROM OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:07.872
SHOULD THERE BE A SEPARATE

CERTAINLY SO --

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:16.214
ONE THING THAT WE MENTIONED IN A

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.416
RECENT REPORT IS THAT THE

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:19.750
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:21.085
CONSIDER SAVING.

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:22.753
BOTH FOR AN ECONOMIC RECESSION

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.255
AND FOR A NATURAL DISASTER

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:25.857
SHOULD THOSE THINGS OCCUR

00:35:25.923 --> 00:35:28.059
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND WHEN WE HAVE

00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:29.861

THOSE GENERALLY JUST FOCUS ON A

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:34.665
RECESSION BUT IF.

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:36.033

IN ONE ACCOUNT YOU COULD CHOOSE

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.448
TO PUT IT IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:51.983
THE ADVANTAGE OF PUTTING IT IN

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:53.351
SEPARATE ACCOUNTS IS OF COURSE.

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:55.319
IT JUST HELPS SORT OF CLARIFY

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:09.133
AT THE YOU KNOW AT THE SAME AT

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:09.700
THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:12.537
HAVING THE MONEY AVAILABLE IS

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:13.504
REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:30.655
THE THINKING BEHIND THE OPTION

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.890
TO CREATE A SEPARATE RESOLVE --

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:35.293
FOR PAYING FOR OTHER DISASTER

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.627
RELATED COSTS --

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:37.862
WOULD NOT THAT THE

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:39.530
ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE.

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:40.998
TO ME TO RETAIN AS MUCH

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:43.334
FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE TO

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:44.835
ADDRESS STRAIGHT STATE NEEDS.

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:46.737
ON THAT CREATING A SEPARATE

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:49.373
RESOLVE FOR SPECIFIC PAPPAS

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.175
REDUCES THAT FLEXIBILITY --

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:52.476
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE VAST

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:54.512
MAJORITY OF FINDING OUT OF THE

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:57.181
S. IF YOU HAS HISTORICALLY.

00:36:57.248 --> 00:36:59.951
BEEN USED TO SATISFY THE NEEDS

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:00.418
THE STATE'S NEEDS FOR

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.987
EMERGENCIES NATURAL DISASTERS.

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:08.259
AND DISASTER RECOVERY --

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:08.826
THE END OF RECESSION IS NOT

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:11.963
ENOUGH WAS HE HOWEVER WE ARE

00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:14.065
HAPPY TO CONTINUE HAVING ON

00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:17.201
GOING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT.

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:19.003
THANK YOU SIMILAR MANNER TO THE

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.104
DISASTERS WERE SEEING WITH THE

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.872
FIRES AND FLOODS OR IF INCREASED

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:23.474
DRAMATICALLY A MEMBER FOR

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:24.909
RESPONDING BACK TO FIRES BACK IN

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.544
THE LATE EIGHTIES EARLY NINETIES.

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.646
THERE'S DEFINITELY SMALLER

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:31.482
BECAUSE THAT THE COST --

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:33.818
FOR THESE DISASTERS WHY WOULD IT

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:35.620
LIMIT FLEXIBILITY IF YOU TO PUT

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:39.290
IN TWO SEPARATE FUNDS --

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:41.926
WE DO WE DO APPRECIATE --

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.194
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULTIES

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.196
IN THE ECONOMY BUT THE

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:46.597
ADMINISTRATION FEELS THAT.

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:49.467
THE RESULTS WE HAVE CURRENTLY ON

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:50.868
THE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH THE

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:52.503
BUS APPROACH WE ARE TAKING

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.372
LOOKING AT THE LONG TOM.

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:55.339
IS.

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:58.142
IS IN TO TO A LARGE EXTENT

00:37:58.209 --> 00:37:59.644
ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE NEEDS.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.712
BUT I I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO

00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:03.314
WRAP MY ARMS AROUND GOING BACK

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:05.216
TO THE THE PREVIOUS RECESSION

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:06.150
HAVE A GREAT IT WAS.

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:07.652
HE STILL PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.453
FUNDED RIGHT NOW TO THIS DAY IN

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.057
YEAH THE THE EXT RECESSION MAY

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.392
NOT BE AS IMPACTFUL AS IT WAS.

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:16.260
YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS ONE STILL.

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:19.096
WE PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED SO I MEAN.

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.264
TO ME YOU CAN EVER HAVE A LARGER

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:23.367
LARGE ENOUGH RESERVE SO AND JUST.

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:24.568
TRAFFIC WE HAVE TO SEPARATE AND

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:25.703
NEVER GOT PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.340
IT'S GOING TO BE WITH THE THE

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:29.907
ARCTIC BLAST WHATEVER IT'S

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:31.375
CALLED --

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:33.077
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA DO YOU HAVE

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.346
MORE PROBLEMS SO I AM NOT SURE

00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:35.946
IF I AGREE WITH YOU TOTALLY ON

00:38:36.013 --> 00:38:39.316
THAT BUT WOULD DO WE NOTED

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:39.617
[inaudible]

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:43.521
THANK YOU.

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.923
SO ON THE PANEL NUMBER TWO OKAY.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.324
I'M SO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.627
OUT INTRODUCES THE GOVERNOR'S OB

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.829
BUDGETARY BORROWING PROPOSALS AS

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:53.964
WELL AS OUR COMMENTS RELATED AND

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:55.499
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THOSE

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:56.600
PROPOSALS.

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:57.401
SO -- THE

00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:58.536
GOVERNOR PROPOSES A TOTAL

00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:00.571
BUDGETARY BORROWING PACKAGE OF

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:01.605
FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.307
THAT BUDGETARY BORROWING BEING

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:04.575
OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS THAT THE

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.610
GENERAL FUND STILL OWES THAT --

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:09.613
IT USED TO BORROWING THAT USED

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.215
TO ADDRESS FOR FALLS IN THE PAST --

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:13.050
AT THE TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS OF

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:14.819
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ARE TO

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.487
REPAY TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:17.588
APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:18.923
BILLION DOLLARS IN SPECIAL FUND

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:19.857
LOANS.

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:23.561
AND THEN TO REPAY ONE POINT

00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:25.296
SEVEN TO BUDGETARY DEFERRALS.

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:26.897
ARE THE SPECIAL FUND LOANS WOULD

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.065
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:29.800
ELIMINATE WHAT IS AN EXISTING

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.302
MULTI YEAR PLAN TO ADDRESS THOSE

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:33.337
SPECIAL FUND LOANS OVER THE NEXT

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:35.106
FEW YEARS --

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:37.308
AND THEN WOULD REPAY THE

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:39.643
ENTIRETY OF THAT AMOUNT IN IN

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.911
NINETEEN TWENTY JUST USING

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:42.346
GENERAL FUND AVAILABLE RESOURCES.

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:43.848
ON THE ON THE TO BUDGETARY

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:45.182
DEFERRALS --

00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:47.084
ONE IS A PAYROLL DEFERRAL AND

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.886
WHICH JUNE PAYROLL FOR STATE

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:50.287
EMPLOYEES AS REFLECTED AS IT

00:39:50.354 --> 00:39:51.388
FROM JUST AN ACCOUNTING

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:52.890
PERSPECTIVE IN JULY.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.391
ON THIS DOES NOT AFFECT WHEN

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.160
STATE EMPLOYEES ARE PAID --

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:57.661
AND THEN THE SECOND IS THAT THE

00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:59.563
FOURTH QUARTER PAYMENT TO

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.432
CALPERS GOES OUT IN THE FIRST

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:03.434
QUARTER OF THE FOLLOWING FISCAL

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:04.969
YEAR JUST A FEW DAYS LATE.

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:06.604
I'M BOTH OF THESE ARE ACTUALLY

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.605
ASSOCIATED WITH ONGOING

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:11.008
BUDGETARY SAVINGS BECAUSE THE

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.643
YOU KNOW PREVIOUS JUNE'S.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.612
PAYMENT FOR STATE EMPLOYEE

00:40:14.678 --> 00:40:15.446
PAYROLLS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:16.881
CHEAPER THAN THE UPCOMING JUNE

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.182
BECAUSE PAYROLL TENDS TO GROW

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:19.750
OVER TIME AND SO THAT.

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:20.885
THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:21.919
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS EACH YEAR

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:23.220
THAT THE BUDGET ACCUMULATES AS A

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:24.855
RESULT OF THESE JUST ONGOING

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:25.990
ACTIONS.

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:28.225
SO WE HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS

00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:32.363
RELATED TO THE IS THE FIRST ARM

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:32.930
RELATED TO THE SPECIAL FUND

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:33.397
LOANS.

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:33.864
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:34.965
LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE HIGH

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:36.834
INTEREST LIABILITIES LIKE MAKING

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:38.335
A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO THE

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:40.838
PENSION SYSTEMS OVER REPAYING

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:41.505
THE SPECIAL PHONE LINES OF THIS

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:42.640
YEAR.

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.308
AND THAT'S BECAUSE PENSION

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.576
PAYMENTS HAVE MUCH HIGHER

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:47.011
INTEREST RATES ASSOCIATED WITH

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:47.978
THEM SPECIAL FUND LOANS HAVE

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:50.047
VERY LOWER SOMETIMES NO INTEREST

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:50.514
AT ALL.

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.515
AND THE STATE COULD SAVE

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.884
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF IF IT

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:56.020
PRIORITIZE THOSE HIGHER INTEREST

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:57.288
LIABILITIES.

00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:58.322
LET ME KNOW DIFFERENT IN A A

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:00.324
HOMEOWNER CARDHOLDER PAYING OFF

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:01.759
THEIR HIGH INTEREST EXACTLY

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.194
EXACTLY.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.128
I'M.

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.362
MORE AND THEN OF COURSE THE

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:06.397
STATE WOULD KEEP ITS CURRENT

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:07.731
PLAN THAT IT ALREADY HAS IN

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:09.366
PLACE TO ADDRESS THE SPECIAL FOR

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.935
MONTHS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:12.670
WE ALSO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.705
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO UNDO THE

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.106
TWO DEFERRALS --

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:17.041
AND THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:19.443
THIS THE FIRST IS THAT

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.878
ESSENTIALLY IT BE YOU KNOW AS I

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:22.079
MENTIONED BEFORE THESE BOTH

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:23.614
INVOLVE SOME STATE SAVINGS THAT

00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:24.715
ARE ON GOING.

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:25.983
BUT ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION HAS%

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.484
INDICATED THAT ONE OF THE

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:28.919
REASONS TO UNDO THESE DEFERRALS

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.254
IS TO PUT A TOOL BACK IN THE

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.755
TOOL BOX FOR THE STATE TO USE

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:33.824
AGAIN IN A FUTURE RECESSION.

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.526
THIS IS MORE LIKE A RESERVE

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:37.061
ACTION THAN IT IS LIKE A DEATH

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:38.162
ACTION.

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.897
AND SO AS A RESULT WE RECOMMEND

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.065
USING THAT ONE POINT SEVEN

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:42.166
BILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WANTED TO

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:43.100
BUILD MORE RESERVES WITH

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.301
ACTUALLY JUST PUTTING THAT MONEY

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:45.870
IN RESERVE BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:46.871
LITTLE BIT INTEREST ON THAT

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:48.305
MONEY YOU WOULD JUST KEEP THE

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:48.973
STATE SAVINGS THAT ARE

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:49.340
ASSOCIATED FROM.

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:51.008
YEAR TO YEAR AND IT WOULD JUST

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:52.676
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CERTAIN --

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:56.580
THAN THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND DO

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:57.181
ON DOING AND REDOING IT TO FOR

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:58.616
ALL.

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:00.517
HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.

00:42:00.584 --> 00:42:00.985
FINANCE.

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:01.719
GREG BREAST DEPARTMENT OF

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.454
FINANCE --

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:03.954
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:07.558
CERTAINLY TO THE DEBT SO WHILE

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.293
WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.594
DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS WHETHER

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:11.929
IT'S RETIREMENT LIABILITIES ARE

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.831
BUDGETARY DEBT OR PUTTING MORE

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:16.133
RESERVES SIDE --

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.168
THIS APPROACH WAS CAN EVEN

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:20.204
HANDEDLY RECOGNIZING ALL THE

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:21.205
DIFFERENT.

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:24.909
TO THAT GETS OUT THERE IN TRYING --

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:27.778
TO TO TAKE A A PLAN FORWARD THAT

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:30.047
WOULD PAY OFF CERTAIN THINGS AND

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.782
THEN ALSO ADDRESS SHORT TERM

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:32.917
WHICH IS MORE THE BUDGETARY

00:42:32.983 --> 00:42:34.618
LOANS PAYING THOSE OFF.

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.153
IN THE LONG TERM DEBT OF THE

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.721
RETIREMENT --

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.590
PAYMENTS --

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:40.557
WHAT WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:41.659
DIFFERENT ING --

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:44.094
INTEREST PAYMENTS OR DIFFERENT

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:45.195
INTERESTS THAT LIABILITY

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:46.697
ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIFFERENT

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:50.301
TYPES OF DEBT --

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:50.668
FOR INSTANCE --

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:53.404
WELL THE THE LA --

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.238
STATED THAT --

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:56.407
PAYING OFF THERETIREMENT DEBT

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:58.676
OVER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS --

00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:00.377
WITH MORE OF A A LARGER OF

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:02.346
PAYMENT WOULD WOULD HELP OUT IN

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:03.047
SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:05.683
LATER -- IF

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:07.918
WE PAY OFF SOME OF THE DEBT SO

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:10.354
WE HAVE NOW THAT ARE DUE FOR THE

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:12.222
BUDGETARY LOANS THOSE PROGRAMS

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:13.424
THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS COULD

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.960
USE THOSE FUNDS --

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:17.027
TO FOR THEIR THEIR PROGRAMS

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:18.195
THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DONE

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.463
OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.165
YEARS BECAUSE IT ALONE TO BEEN

00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:23.701
OUTSTANDING --

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:24.768
TO CERTAIN THINGS THE TO THAT

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:26.437
EXPRESS BACKED THEY WERE TRYING

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:29.039
TO BALANCE A VERY DELICATE.

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:31.442
TO A PRIORITIES AGREEMENTS AMONG

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:31.942
OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.644
INVOLVED

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:39.216
ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.317
THIS ONE QUICK QUESTION IF THE

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:41.652
DECISION IS MADE TO PAY OFF

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:42.920
ADDITIONAL DEBT.

00:43:42.987 --> 00:43:43.687
WHAT WOULD LEGISLATURE NEED TO

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:46.123
DO TO DIRECTLY MINISTRATIONS

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.093
TIMING OF PAYMENTS?

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:50.594
I DO DO YOU MEAN TIMING A

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:52.262
PAYMENT WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:53.364
CORRECT YEAH.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.766
I'M AT SO YEAH THERE IS --

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:56.333
ONE IMPORTANT THING THAT I

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.334
DIDN'T MENTION IN THE

00:43:57.401 --> 00:43:59.269
PRESENTATION HERE --

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:01.038
IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:03.307
PROPOSES MAKING MOST OF THESE

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:06.443
DEBT REPAYMENTS INCLUDING THE

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.011
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:10.114
PENSIONS WHICH WERE AGENDA.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.049
VERY EARLY IN THE FISCAL YEAR --

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:13.117
IN JULY --

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.852
OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:16.086
FISCAL YEAR AND THAT'S DESPITE

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.288
THE FACT THAT THE STATE'S MAJOR

00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:19.289
REVENUE --

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:21.258
COLLECTION MONTHS ARE DECEMBER

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.627
JANUARY AND APRIL AND IT REVENUE

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:24.995
ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY ON

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.463
CERTAIN WE DON'T HAVE ANY

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:27.564
PARTICULAR REASON TO BELIEVE

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:29.166
THAT THIS ESTIMATE IS ANY LESS

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:30.567
ON CERTAIN THAN ANY OTHER YEAR.

00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:32.269
BUT BECAUSE REVENUE ESTIMATES

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:33.437
ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN WE

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:34.938
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO WAIT

00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:36.373
UNTIL LATER IN THE FISCAL YEAR

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.875
ONCE THE STATE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:39.576
ITS COLLECTIONS --

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:40.878
TO MAKE THESE PAYMENTS SUCH THAT

00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:43.147
WE CAN BE ASSURED THAT ON THE

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.681
REVENUES ARE GOING TO

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:46.016
MATERIALIZE THAT WE ANTICIPATE.

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:47.818
THANK YOU.

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:49.053
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS IN THE

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.220
COMMISSION WILL MOVE ON TO USER

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:52.389
MAY I ANSWER --

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:53.457
TO I MEAN AS FAR AS THE AT THE

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:54.491
GENERAL FUND CASH FLOW

00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:55.926
MANAGEMENT.

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.428
WE DO.

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:59.730
LOOK THAT OVER VERY SERIOUSLY

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:03.400
VERY CAREFULLY EACH EACH YEAR.

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:04.902
AND WITH OUR BUDGETARY --

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:06.170
DEBTS AND EVERYTHING WE WANT TO

MAKE SURE THOSE ARE INCORPORATED

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.506
IN A TIMELY FASHION IN TERMS OF

00:45:09.573 --> 00:45:11.208
OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS.

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:12.576
CAN THE EARLIER IN THE YEAR THAT

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:14.344
MAYBE THE LARGER PAYMENTS GO OUT

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:16.080
THE MORE BENEFIT THEY WOULD HAVE

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:17.581
FOR THAT YEAR ESPECIALLY IF

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.216
YOU'RE INVESTING MONIES --

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:20.517
SO WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:22.920
THERE'S EQUAL WAITING ON ON SOME

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:23.387
OF THESE.

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:25.222

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:33.163
SOME ARE ARE MORE LATER BUT

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.799
CERTAINLY WE TAKE A VERY --

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.868
FISCALLY PRUDENT APPROACH TO

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.236
EVALUATING THE CASH FLOW

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:40.471
PROJECTIONS.

00:45:40.537 --> 00:45:42.406
AND ONCE WE DO THOSE AGAIN IN

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:43.607
JUNE WILL TAKE INTO

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:44.875

FEW DECADES --

00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:36.553
ON AVERAGE AND THEN AS A RESULT

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.388
RESULTING IN SLIGHTLY LOWER

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:40.190
EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS OVER TIME

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:42.526

THAT SAVINGS OVER TIME FOR THE

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:44.161
STATE.

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:45.829
THAT SAID ON THE STATE SAVINGS

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:46.763
ASSOCIATE WITH EACH OF THE

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.265
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS IS LIKELY

PAYMENT OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:55.072
THE SYSTEM ANTICIPATES THAT THAT

00:47:55.138 --> 00:47:56.840
WOULD RESULT IN ABOUT SIX POINT

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:58.475
THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:00.277
OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES.

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:01.812
CAL STAR IS ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:02.879
THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WOULD

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:04.214
RESULT IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:05.849
FEW DECADES BUT IN CONTRAST TO

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:08.352
CALPERS THERE'S AN ESTIMATED 20%

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:09.820
CHANCE THAT THE STATE WOULD NOT

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.288
ACHIEVE SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:12.055
FEW DECADES.

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:13.190
AND THAT RATHER THOSE SAVINGS

00:48:13.257 --> 00:48:17.394
WOULD BE ACHIEVED HOSTAGE.

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:18.228
TWENTY FORTY SIX SO ARE THE

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:19.563
FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT DOES

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.331
PROVIDE SOME OF OUR COMMENTS

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:23.033
RELATED --

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.134
TO OF THESE PENSION PAYMENTS AND

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:25.769
THEN A COUPLE OF OPTIONS FOR

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.271
CONSIDERATION.

00:48:27.337 --> 00:48:29.172
FIRST ON ON THIS CALPERS VERSUS

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.707
CAL STIRS ISSUE THAT I JUST

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:32.943
BROUGHT UP AN IMPORTANT THING TO

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:33.877
CONSIDER IS YOUR SORT OF

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:36.413
THINKING THROUGH THIS DYNAMIC IS

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.714
WHAT IS YOUR GOAL FOR THE

00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:39.149
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT.

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:40.751
ON THE ONE HAND ON THE

00:48:40.817 --> 00:48:42.853
LEGISLATURE MIGHT HAVE THE GOAL

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:44.655
TO ADDRESS UNFUNDED LIABILITY

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:46.623
EQUALLY ACROSS THE SYSTEMS OR OR

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.958
ACROSS BOTH OF THE SYSTEMS.

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:49.459
IN WHICH CASE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:50.761
PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE SENSE THE

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.429
LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO HAVE A

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:54.731
GOAL TO MAXIMIZE STATE SAVINGS

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.466
OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES IN

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:58.669
WHICH CASE A PAYMENT TO CALPERS

00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:01.538
VERSUS CASTERS WOULD BE JUST

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:03.340
MORE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE BACK ON

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:04.141
I'M.

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:06.109
SECOND ON THE CALPERS PAYMENT

00:49:06.176 --> 00:49:07.477
AND THE WAY THAT IT'S STRUCTURED

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:08.645
SPECIFICALLY.

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:10.380
SO THE SYSTEM ANTICIPATES THAT

00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:12.082
THIS WOULD RESULT IN SIX POINT

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.216
THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:14.718
IN TOTAL --

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.086
AND THAT THE GENERAL FUND WOULD

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:17.321
MAKE A THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:18.689
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT --

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:19.256
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT SIX

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:21.825
POINT THREE BILL BUT THE SIX

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:22.693
POINT THREE BILLION IN SAVINGS

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:24.261
WOULD ONLY ACCRUE TO THE GENERAL

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:25.095
FUND.

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:26.697
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN --

00:49:26.763 --> 00:49:27.831
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:28.632
THE GENERAL FUND THAT MAKES

00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:30.767
PENSION PAYMENTS IT'S ALSO OTHER

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:32.469
FUNDS LIKE THE FEDERAL FUNDS --

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:34.237
SPECIAL FUNDS AND THEN TRUST

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:35.672
FUNDS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE CSU

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:36.606
TRUST FUND.

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:37.908
SO THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.209
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:40.844
WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED THREE

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:42.713
BILLION FOR THE GENERAL FUND AND

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:43.847
THREE POINT THREE BILLION

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.282
APPROXIMATELY FOR THESE OTHER

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:46.783
FUNDS.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:50.420
I'M WE JUST HAVE TO GLOSS OVER

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.154
SOME OF THE TECHNICAL DETAIL

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:55.492
HERE BUT WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE --

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:56.026
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:57.427
CONSIDER.

00:49:57.494 --> 00:49:58.862
THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY MAXIMIZE

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:00.063
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT WOULD

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.198
PROVIDE SLIGHTLY MORE GENERAL

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:02.599
FUND BENEFIT.

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.067
IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT FUNDS THAT

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:06.236
BENEFIT FROM THE PLAN ALSO REPAY

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:07.604
THE GENERAL FUND FOR THEIR

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:08.905
PROPORTIONATE SHARE.

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:10.006
IT WOULD REQUEST THAT THE

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:11.942
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:12.642
FUNDS --

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:14.111
REIMBURSE THE STATE FOR THE

00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:15.846
BENEFIT THAT IT WOULD ARRIVE AS

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:17.581
A RESULT OF THE PLAN.

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:18.515
AND THEN FINALLY IT WOULD

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:19.716
MAXIMIZE BENEFIT TO THE MOTOR

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:21.451
VEHICLE ACCOUNT WHICH CURRENTLY

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.653
BENEFITS BY ONLY ROUGHLY THREE

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.187
HUNDRED MILLION UNDER THE

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:25.322
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT WOULD

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:27.457
BENEFIT BY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:29.926
UNDER OUR OUR OUR ALTERNATIVE.

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:32.028
HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:32.329
[inaudible]

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:35.465
FINANCE.

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.267
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:38.769

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:46.109
FIRSTLY I I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.878
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.379
PRIMARY GOAL IS TO ADDRESS BOTH

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.747
SYSTEMS --

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:54.584
UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO THIS THAT

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.686
REALLY SPEAKS --

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:58.054
TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT --

00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:00.157
THE STATE DIRECTOR OF THE

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:02.559
CASTERS PAYMENT TO CALPERS --

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:03.393
AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S A

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.295
PROBABILITY THAT THE SAVINGS

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:06.830
WILL BE ACHIEVED --

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:07.964
BY THE STATE SOONER FROM THE

00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:09.833
CALPERS SIDE VERSUS THE CAL STAR

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.101
SITES BOTH PROPOSALS ARE REALLY

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.370
AIMED AT MAXIMIZING SAVINGS OVER

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:15.172
THE LONG TERM --

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:16.807
IN AND OUT TO THE YELLOW YES

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.341

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.480
BILLION DOLLARS TO THE FIVE

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:24.781
STATE PLANS BASED ON THE

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:26.416
UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF EACH OF

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:27.884
THOSE PLANS --

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:30.754
AND REQUIRE THE REPAYMENT FROM

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:35.058
THE NON GENERAL FUND FUNDS --

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.393
AGAIN -- OUR

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:37.360
PROPOSAL IS TO AIMS AIMS TO

MORE ACT EQUITABLY --

00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:45.302
WHILE THE LA THOSE ALTERNATE

00:51:45.368 --> 00:51:46.837
RECOMMENDATION WOULD INCREASE

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.138
GENERAL FUNDS APPROPRIATE SHARE

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:50.040
THE BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:52.275
PROPOSED PAYMENT WE NOTE THAT

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:54.778
THE CURRENT PROPOSAL ALREADY --

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:57.547
DEDICATES THE MAJORITY OF THE

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:59.483
BENEFIT TO THE GENERAL FUND --

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:01.518
ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:02.385
THE YELLOW ALEJO'S

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.287
RECOMMENDATION WOULD REQUIRE

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:06.823
THAT WE EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.124
OF THOSE OTHER FUNDS TO MAKE

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.926

IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SB STE WHICH

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:17.434
MADE THE US SIX BILLION DOLLAR

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:19.669
SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT.

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:22.939
TO CALPERS AND WAS STRUCTURED IN

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:24.574
SUCH A WAY THAT WE HAVE FOR

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.810
OTHER FUNDS REPAYING THOSE LOANS

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:28.478
AS WELL AS A GENERAL FUND.

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:29.579
AND THEREFORE --

00:52:29.646 --> 00:52:31.581
THE ADDITIONAL LOAN THAT WE

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.316
WOULD BE CREATING THROUGH THIS

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:34.818
PROPOSAL.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.453
WOULD -- PUT

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.488
ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON THESE

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.423
OTHER FUNDS THAT SHOULD BE

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.526
GREATLY CONSIDERED.

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:45.061
I'M ALSO UNLIKE THE SPD FOR

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:47.430

AN ALMOST IMMEDIATE REDUCTION TO

YIELD SAVINGS OVER THE LONG TERM.

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:55.372
WHICH MEANS IT COULD BE MORE

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:56.940
DIFFICULT FOR THESE FUNDS TO

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.975
ABSORB ANOTHER --

BOTH THE DETERMINISTIC BASIS.

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:36.780
WHICH ASSUMES THAT THE FUND

00:53:36.846 --> 00:53:37.414
WOULD EARN SOME PERCENT EACH AND

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.214

CURRENT BENEFIT PAYMENTS --

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:58.602
EXCEEDING ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS

00:53:58.668 --> 00:54:00.070
TO THE SYSTEM.

00:54:00.136 --> 00:54:01.004
THERE IS A RISK OF THE SYSTEM OF

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.238
BEING FORCED TO SELL PRODUCTIVE

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:03.974

AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME.

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.443
AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO THE

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:07.544

ENHANCE RETURN.

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:10.180
AS THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.548

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:13.183
INVESTMENT OFFICE IN MANAGING

THE COMMENT THAT MAYBE.

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:36.539
IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT SAVINGS

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.341
COULD BE ACHIEVED BY GIVING THE

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:39.709

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.804
THAT SITUATION LED TO THE

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:10.306

00:55:33.963 --> 00:55:36.499
WHICH WAS KEY IS OUR BOARD WAS

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:38.468

IT'S THIS LIMITED AUTHORITY THAT.

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:52.749
IS LEADING TO THE SITUATION THAT

00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:54.784
IF WE DO RECEIVE MONEY FOR THE

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:57.420

THE SUPPLANTING PAYMENTS --

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:16.579
MORE OF THE THREE BILLION WILL

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.114
LIKELY BE NEEDED TO EFFECTUATE

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:19.248

OVER THE YEARS AND SO

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.061

MORE ISSUES JUST TO BE BRIEF.

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.533
ONE IS THAT HISTORICALLY WHEN

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.302
THE RATES WERE DROPPING THE

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.337

THE STATE WAS ABLE TO RECAPTURE

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:28.845
THE SAVINGS.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.213
AND THEN WHEN HE WENT UP SHE WAS

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:31.247
SUPPOSED.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.449
TO DO THAT BUT ONE THAT SCHOOL

SYSTEM WENT TO ALL THE HAVE

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.421
HISTORICAL KIND OF PROMISE.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.323
HIS JIM JUST EMBEDDED NOW SO

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:42.358
IT'S GONE IN TERMS OF HOW WOULD

CALC STIRS WE DO SUPPORT A AND

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:24.994

FISCALLY PRUDENT WE WE DISAGREE

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:28.130

THE COMMENTS HOW WE DISAGREED

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:32.235
THAT WE SHOULD WAIT TO

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:35.004
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION FOR A

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:37.173
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE BELIEVE

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.008
THAT SOMETHING THAT'S NEEDED NOW --

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.977
I DO WANT TO NOTE --

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:41.677
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:42.745
THAT'S PER THAT --

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.313
THE PROPOSAL BUT I KNOW CAL

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.182
STIRS WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO

TEACHERS RETIREMENT BOARD LEVEL

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:51.420
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:52.655
STAKEHOLDERS WERE ADAMANTLY

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:55.057
OPPOSED TO WHAT WE DO APPRECIATE

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:56.158
THE DILEMMA THAT IT PUT TO

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:57.760
TEACHERS RETIREMENT BOARD IN.

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.929

OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT CHANGING THAT

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:22.084
BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:23.753
ON EDUCATION AND THAT BOARD --

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:25.354
WHILE THEY DO VERY MUCH CARE

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.023
