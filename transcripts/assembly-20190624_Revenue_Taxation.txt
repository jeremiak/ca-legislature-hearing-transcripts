ONE CHANGE WE HAVE A PROPOSED WE HAVE A CONSENT CALENDAR FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR. FILE ITEM TO SB FIVE SEVEN SEVEN WILL BE MOVED TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR. WITH THAT WE ARE A SUB CURRENTLY A SUB COMMITTEE BUT THIS ITEM IS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY WHY DON'T WE MOVE TO FILE ITEM. SEVEN SB TWO NINETY FOUR SENATOR HILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR IN THE COLLEAGUES. I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF THEY'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE ON CRAFT IN THE LANGUAGE TO ALLOW FOR THESE. THESE CHARITIES TO EXEMPT A PRO RATED PORTION OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES AS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS AND COMMENT H.. AND ALSO HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE LOWERED THE CAP OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION AS SUGGESTED IN COMMON QUE. SB TWO NINETY FOUR WILL AID NON PROFITS AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BY EXPANDING THE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A SAYS PROPERTY ABOUT THE PROPERTY ANNUALLY. SPECIFICALLY IT WILL HELP A VERY DESERVING CHARITY FROM DAY ONE WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. YOU'RE ALL AWARE FOUR OUT OF FIVE LEAST AFFORDABLE RENTAL MARKETS NATIONWIDE ARE IN CALIFORNIA. NON PROFITS THAT DID NOT RECEIVE ANY TAX CREDITS OR LOANS FROM THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE A CAP PLACED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX IT MAY BE EXEMPTED ANNUALLY. AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS THAT DO RECEIVE TAX CREDITS OR LOANS FROM H. CD HAVE NO LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES THAT CAN BE EXEMPTED. AND NO MINIMUM PERCENTAGE REQUIRED OF TENANTS WHO ARE LOW INCOMEIN ORDER TO RECEIVE A PRO RATED PORTION OF THE PROPERTY TAXES EXEMPTED. THE REQUESTED SAMITY OAK OF SAN MATEO COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE. IN IN SB TWO NINETY FOUR WE LOWERED THE THRESHOLD FOR NONPROFITS. TO RECEIVE A PROPERTY TAX BENEFIT THE SAINT FRANCIS CENTER IN MY DISTRICT RECENTLY WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE A FORTY EIGHT UNIT. APARTMENTCOMPLEX ALL WITH PRIVATE DONATIONS. AT A COST OF TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE BUILDING HAD EXISTING TENANTS IN BECAUSE OF HOW TIGHT AND EXPENSE OF THE BAY AREA RENTAL MARKET IS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO IMMEDIATELY AFFECT ALL OF THE TENANTS THAT WERE NOT LOW INCOME. AND THEY PAY THE PRICE THEY RECEIVE THE TAX BILL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE COUNTY. WITH THE SAN MATEO COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE CALLED MY OFFICE AND REQUESTED THAT THE SAINT FRANCIS CENTER. AND OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED CHARITIES GET A PRO RATED PORTION OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES EXEMPTED AS LONG AS THEY HAVE AT LEAST. 50% OF LOWINCOME TENANTS AND I AGREED WITH THEM IT'S ONLY FAIR AND IT MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US THIS OPPORTUNITY AND SURE I VOTE AND I DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AUDREY RETIRED CHECK ON BEHALF OF SAN MATEO COUNTY AND THE SAN MATEO COUNTY ASSESSOR IN SUPPORT OF SB -- TWO NINETY FOUR OUR COUNTY HAS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE AN UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND FOR HOUSING WHICH HAS LED TO SOME OF THE HIGHEST HOUSING PRICES IN THE COUNTRY. AND GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CHALLENGES IN OUR AREA IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO PRESERVE IN THIS IS. WHICH FAMILY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS DESPITE RECENT ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE THE CAP AND TO KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASING PROPERTY VALUES THE CURRENT PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION CAP LIMITS THE ABILITY OF THESE TYPES OF NONPROFITS TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE CURRENT 90% LOW INCOME TENDENCY REQUIREMENT LIMITS CHARITIES LIKE SAINT FRANCIS WITH A FEW MODERATE INCOME TENANTS IN THE BUILDING FROM BENEFITING FROM THE EXISTING PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. LOWERING THE REQUIRED PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME TENANTS AND PRO RATING THE EXEMPTION WOULD HELP TO ALLEVIATE DISPLACEMENT THAT CAN RESULT WHEN A CHARITY PURCHASES A BUILDING WITH EXISTING TENANTS AS WAS RECENTLY THE CASE WITH THE STATE FOR SAINT FRANCIS CENTER. AND ALLOWS THEM TO USE THESE FUNDS TO HELP MORE FAMILIES SECURE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT SB TWO NINETY FOUR THANK YOU. MANAGER MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION -- AS THOSE OF YOU IN LA COUNTY MAY BE AWARE AGE OF HIS ON EMBARKED ON A VERY AGGRESSIVE -- HOUSING LOW INCOME HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ON PROGRAM WE CURRENTLY HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE UNITS OF LOW INCOME HOUSING LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ON TRACK -- TO TO GET UP TO ABOUT TEN THOUSAND UNITS OVER AND THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING AT ALL WERE -- CERTAINLY CONCERN IN THE LONG RUN THAT THE CURRENT TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR A PROPERTY TAX CAP. I'M WOULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY -- TO TO EMBARK ON THAT -- ON THAT DEVELOP PROG. A PROGRAM AS AGGRESSIVELY AS WE WOULD LIKE -- WE APPRECIATE THE HUNDRED MILLION THAT YOU ALL AGREE TO APPRECIATE -- SENATOR HELL MOVING THIS BILL WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TALKED QUIRK -- I'M KNOWN AS THE GREEN RIVER REAPER ON THIS COMMITTEE BUT I LOVE YOUR PAL. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THERMAL AND ADDRESS BOOK THE GRIM REAPER. REMEMBER THAT -- ONE OKAY SO I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION JUST -- THE IS THIS A THIS ST FRANCIS IS A SICK. IS A PART OF THE CATHOLIC CHARITIES OR SUBJECT DODGE HAPPENS TO BE THE NAME NO I THINK IT'S A I MEAN I'VE KNOWN THEM FOR MANY YEARS IT IS JUST A NAME I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S NOW REALLY AREN'T AFFILIATION -- I MEAN THE THE WOMAN WHO -- CAN FACILITATES AND OPERATES AT THE DIRECTOR OF IT IS -- IS A SISTER. OF BUT NOT OF OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH I BELIEVE BUT IT'S NOT. A PART OF THE CHURCH THIS IS A SEPARATE NONPROFIT. THEN THAT'S WHY IF IT WERE CHURCH IT WOULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT. TO IT IS IT'S RUN BY A NUN. AND A NINE IT SHE IS A NUN SISTER CHRISTINA IS A NON. BUT IT'S NOT A WITH AS WE CALL CATHOLIC ORGANIZATION. WHICH THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS NOT THIS IS A A NON PROFIT THAT SAFE FOR ONE C.. THREE IN IN CALIFORNIA IN THAT'S IN BECAUSE OF ITS FOCUS ON A SEPARATE FROM A EVEN FOR WORD CHURCH SEPARATE FROM A CHURCH OR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION. AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S REQUIRED TO HAVE A LOT OF NODDING GOING ON HERE DID I STRIKE A NERVE SOME. KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN I DO YEAH I JUST I'M. I MEAN IT'S CALLED SAINT FRANCIS AND IS NOT BY ACCIDENT -- WAS A FRENCH IS WHY NO I GO TO SAN FRANCISCO CHURCH IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD TIME QUITE FAMILIAR ST FRANCIS WHICH TELLS ME THAT THIS WAS ON PURPOSE IT WAS NAMED THIS WAY. AND SO IT IS AFFILIATED WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SOME WAY AND I'M JUST ASKING A IN ON WHAT IT REALLY ASIAN IS IT IN. IT IS A DISTINCT. NONPROFIT AND AND I THINK THE CONFUSION IS IS THAT -- IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY FOR THE BILL'S PURPOSES IT'S NOT IMPORTANT WHETHER IT'S FOR CATHOLIC CHURCH OR OR ANYTHING ELSE IT'S FOR ANY ORGANIZATION AS AS SOME OF THE WITNESSES AS TESTIFIED TO AYE THINGS IN OUR OFFICE. IS A NON PROFIT IT'S NOT A ONE OFF BILL IT'S NOT A ONE OF A BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CONCERN WAS AS WE WERE NODDING BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT A ONE ALL I KNOW. I UNDERSTAND THAT I MEAN I'M I'M I'VE READ THROUGH IT I JUST IN LITTLE -- CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING KELLER ORGANIZATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DO WANT TO THANK A MARK CHURCH WHO IS THE SAN MATEO COUNTY ASSESSOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND IN HIS SUPPORT IN THIS BECAUSE HE'S RECOGNIZES THE THE NEED THAT -- THIS BILL WAS WILL RESOLVE SO THANK YOU APPRECIATE RESPECT YES RIVAL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MANAGER I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. MOVING TO FILE ITEM [inaudible] EIGHT SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN SEVERAL CASKEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE MEMBERS AND I TO UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD JUST BE PRESENTING THIS AFTERNOON AND AT THE PRO BRITTONUM -- THEY CONSIDER YOU'LL CONSIDER OF VOTE SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN WOULD PROVIDE A STUDENT LOAN TAX CREDIT FOR THE ENTIREAMOUNT OF INTEREST A PERSON PAID ON THEIR STUDENT LOAN -- THROUGHOUT THE YEAR STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS NOW THE SECOND HIGHEST CATEGORY OF HOUSEHOLD DEBT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITH OVER FORTY FIVE MILLION BORROWERS COLLECTIVELY -- IN ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS MAKING IT GREATER TEMPLE THE CREDIT CARD DEBT AND AUTO LOAN GETS COMBINED. THIS STATE IS DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY WOMEN. IT'S STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES STUDENTS OF COLOR AND FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS THE BURDEN OF THESE LOANS ON THESE PEOPLE HAVE RESULTED. IN A GENERATION POSTPONING TRADITIONAL LIFE MILESTONES LIKE BUYING A HOME GETTING MARRIED STARTING A FAMILY AND SAVING FOR RETIREMENT. THE PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND ADVANCED DEGREES IS HIGHLY ENCOURAGED IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE PRICE TAG FOR ATTENDING COLLEGE IN THE NEED FOR STUDENT LOANS TO COVER THOSE COSTS HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY. WELL INCOME GROWTH HAS REMAINED STAGNANT. IN PROVIDING THIS CREDIT SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN RECOGNIZES THE COST CALIFORNIANS HAVE INCURRED IN PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION AND PROVIDES SMALL MEASURE OF RELIEF. SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN IS SUPPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF PARKS ASSOCIATIONS AND SILICON VALLEY ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN -- DEMOCRATIC CLUB IN WITH ME I HAVE CHRISTOPHER LONG AND MICHAEL CUSTIS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS FOR LONG AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WAS SHEPHERD MULLIN BUT I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING IN MY CAPACITY AS A DELEGATE FROM THE CONFERENCE A CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS. IN SUPPORT OF AS BEFORE. SEVENTY SEVEN WE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE. DO WE WANT TO GIVE HIGHLY EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE AN INCENTIVE TO REMAINING CALIFORNIAN USE THEIR SKILLS HERE. BY PROVIDING MEANINGFUL RELIEF FROM THE MOUNTAIN OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT THEY FACE WITH THIS BILL. OR DO WE WANT TO STAND BY AND WATCH THESE YOUNG MINDS LEAVE FOR A HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE ELSEWHERE. DUE TO THE CRUSHING COMBINATION OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT CALIFORNIA'S HIGH COST OF LIVING THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT. AND LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN MANY AREAS OF THE STATE. THIS BILL PROVIDES A SOLUTION THAT BREAKS FROM THE CURRENT COOKIE CUTTER. NATIONWIDE MODEL THAT APPLIES EQUALLY TO SOMEONE LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO AS IT DOES TO SOMEONE WHO IS LIVING IN NEBRASKA OR SOUTH DAKOTA WHERE THE COST OF LIVING IS SO MUCH LESS. THE STUDENT LOAN CRISIS IS WELL KNOWN AND NOT GOING TO BELABOR IT HERE. BUT IN JUST THE LAST TWELVE YEARS IT HAS SKYROCKETED A HUNDRED AND 57% FROM FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS TODAY. 40% OF STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ARE EXPECTED TO DEFAULT ON THEIR LOANS BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON A PERSONAL NOTE I WORKED ALL THROUGH COLLEGE TOOK TWO YEARS OFF IN BETWEEN UNDERGRAD AND LAW SCHOOL TO PAY DOWN MY OWN PERSONAL STUDENT LOANS. RECEIVED A NINETY THOUSAND DOLLAR SCHOLARSHIP TO ATTEND LAW SCHOOL. AND WAS ABLE TO REFINANCE MY LOANS THANKFULLY TO A MUCH LOWER INTEREST RATE YET LAST YEAR ALONE I PAID MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN INTEREST PERSONALLY. ON MY OWN STUDENT LOANS. TUITION ALONE AT THE LAW SCHOOL THAT I ATTENDED IS NOW MORE THAN FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT DOESN'T IN COSTS THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE COST OF LIVING. BUT MY STORY IS HARDLY UNIQUE FROM MY GENERATION AND I'M HERE TODAY TO BE A VOICE FOR THAT. AS THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST TEACHERS DOCTORS ENGINEERS LAWYERS AND SCIENTIFIC MINDS CONTEMPLATE LEAVING THIS STATE. WE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE. DO YOU WANT TO SIT BY. WELL MORE AND MORE CALIFORNIANS LEAVE. WE'LL ALL LOSE OUT ON THAT POTENTIAL TAX REVENUE. OR DO WE WANT TO USE THIS BILL AS A MEANS TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL RELIEF. AND INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO STAY HERE. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR AS BEFORE. SEVEN SEVEN THANK YOU WE HAVE A QUORUM IF WE CAN JUST PAUSE AND WE DON'T -- SHE LEFT. I WAS THIS CLOSE ALL RIGHT SO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- CONDITION GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. MY NAME IS MICHAEL CASA SOME A RESIDENT OF NEW YORK NEW YORK CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TO PART OF SB SOME. FORTY SEVEN SB. FOUR SEVEN SEVEN HOME PERSONAL INCOME TAX CREDIT DEDUCTION FOR QUALIFIED EDUCATIONAL LOANS. AS A RECENT GRADUATE OF SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY MY STUDENT LOAN DEBT. EXCEEDS OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IN LOANS. WHEN I STARTED COLLEGE IN? TWO THOUSAND NINE AT ENTERED WITH THE G. D.. HELLO LOVE OF OF A LEGO LEVEL OF EDUCATION. THROUGH MY COLLEGE CAREER I CHOSE -- TO CONTINUE ACQUIRING AN ASSOCIATE OF ARTS BACHELOR OF ARTS IN A MASTERS OF SCIENCE. IN URBAN REGIONAL PLANNING A TON OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY. A RECENT GRADUATE ON MAY. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY NINETEEN A AND I RECEIVED THREE CERTIFICATE FOR MY MASTERS ONE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT. THE THIRD ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING. I'M CURRENTLY -- LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT I HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN WORKING PART TIME SINCE I'VE GRADUATED. I'VE HAD SOME LEADS BUT I'M STILL CONCERNED ABOUT PAYING OFF MY DEBT WHICH START -- TO MY PAYMENT START IN DERRY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE ACCORDING TO MY NET NOW COUNT. THE COST OF THE TO LIVE IN THE BAY AREA HAS -- COST IT CAUSED ME TO DRAW ON STUDENT LOANS OF A COURSE FROM MY TENURE EDUCATIONAL CAREER AS I STATED I ENTERED COLLEGE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WITH THE GT. AFTER THOSE YEARS I USED UP MOST OF MY FEDERAL GRANT LOAN SO I HAD TO START WHEN I DECIDED TO GO TO THE MASTERS OF URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING I DECIDED. TO DRAW LOANS IN ORDER TO REACH MY GOALS -- AND GET A MASTERS IN URBAN REGIONAL PLANNING. I'M ONE OF THE FIRST STUDENTS -- ONE OF THE FIRST MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY TO GET HIGHER EDUCATION MY MOM AND DAD BOTH ONLY HAD. HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE ARE HIGH SCHOOL. DIPLOMAS. AND MY BROTHERS NONE NONE OF THEM GRADUATED OTHER THAN HIGH SCHOOL. I DECIDED TO GO BACK WHEN I WAS THIRTY EIGHT GOING ON THIRTY NINE CRISIS IN MY LIFE AND YOU KNOW RIGHT BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND NINE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN -- YOU KNOW WHEN I GOT INTO SAN JOSE CITY COLLEGE A LOT OF MY MENTORS -- ADVISED ME THAT I SHOULD GO INTO HIGHER EDUCATION AND CHOIR. MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND AT THAT TIME I WAS A STUDENT TRUSTEE AT TEN OF THE EVERGREEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. IN A CHAPTER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES WAS ENCOURAGING THAT. THROUGH THE BILLS ARE GOING TO LEGISLATURE FOR THE STUDENT SENATE FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS FACT. THAT THEY NEEDED MORE PEOPLE TO GRADUATE WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE RIGHT AND SO. THAT ENCOURAGE ME AND AND TO GET MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN. THROUGH MY EDUCATIONAL. COURSES AT TIMES A STATE I DECIDED TO GET MY MASTERS DEGREE. BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE AND AND THAT I WAS GOING TO BE STUCK WITH OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AND I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT THIS BILL WOULD GREATLY HELP NOT ONLY ME. BUT MILLIONS OF OTHER STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE OCCURRED DID ALONG THAT. I'M SORRY. CLEARLY I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL NOT ONLY FOR ME BUT FOR THE MILLIONS OF OTHER STUDENTS. THAT HAVE OCCURRED STUDENT LOAN DEBT INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK YOU ADDITIONAL IN THIS ISN'T SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR PARK -- SENATOR Y. CASKEY YOU'VE BEEN MY FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. MIKE IN TYPE TWO CONCERNS WITH THE BILL FIRST OF ALL IT'S A NON REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT. AND ARGUABLY THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THIS THE MOST NEED HELP THE MOST. ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY TASTES STATE TAXES BECAUSE THEIR INCOME IS TOO LOW. AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE LEFT ENTIRELY OUT OF THIS. THE OTHER THING IS THE COST IS PRETTY HIGH IT'S A BILLION DOLLARS. AND I JUST WONDER IF THAT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT REDUCING TUITION AT STATE SCHOOLS. ARE UP SCHOLARSHIPS AT CETERA SO MY CONCERN IS THAT. THIS DOES NOT GO THIS MONEY WOULD NOT GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED NAMELY THOSE PEOPLE ARE MAKING TOO LITTLE INCOME. TO PAY TAXES AND THEN. YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THERE'S A BETTER USE OF THE MONEY. THIRTY CHAIR FIVE THERE'S THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE HIGH PRICE OF OF OF A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION RIGHT NOW IS IS PROHIBITING SOME PEOPLE TO GO THE QUESTION IS IS THIS MANY FOLKS IT'S A DIFFERENT BATCH OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING TO GO TO SCHOOL OR MOVING FORWARD IN SCHOOL. WE WANT TO BRING THAT PRICE DOWN THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US LEGISLATURE THE REALITY IS THAT A WHOLE GENERATION OF PEOPLE ARE STUCK WITH THE STUDENT DEBT. THERE'S NO RELIEF FROM THEM EVEN IF WE MADE. UNIVERSITY FREE THEY WOULD STILL BE STUCK WITH THEIR SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THIS IS THIS IS DIRECTED AT THAT CHUNK OF FOLKS WITH THE THE PRICE TAG OF BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THE OTHER QUESTION IS. THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE SO LITTLE OF THEY DON'T PAY TAXES IMAGINE A SINGLE MOM IS A TEACHER. DOES IT MAKE ENOUGH WITH DEDUCTIONS TO PAY TAXES YOU'RE NOT GIVING THAT PERSON A A BREAK AT ALL. OF THIS GENTLEMAN OVER HERE WHO IS YET. I THINK TO GET A PERMANENT JOB. HE WOULD GET NO BREAK SELL THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. WE GET NO BREAK FROM YOUR BILL BECAUSE IT'S AND NON REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT. YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT I GUESS THE IN IN SHEER NUMBERS THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE STUDENT LOANDEBT ARE PEOPLE I HAVE SOME IN COMMAND OF OF TAXES AT THE PAIN BECAUSE THE THE CHALLENGES THAT IF THEY HAVE PAID ANY. OF THEIR STIFF THERE THAT. POR I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE PAYING BACK IN THEIR THEIR THEIR STUDENT LOAN DEBT. BUT THEY STILL OWE IT IN IF YOU'D MAKE IT A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT [inaudible] AND IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO HELP THAN THOSE FOLKS ON THE POOR AND THANK YOU. AT THIS YEAR I AND I BEGAN I'M CHAIRING THE SENATE A SORRY THE ASSEMBLY IS A SELECT COMMITTEE ON STUDENT AT ODDS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU DIGGING INTO THAT LOOKING FOR SOME CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE ENORMOUS BURDEN OF STUDENT AT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCING. I DO AGREE WITH DOCTOR PARK I THINK THE MAKES A REALLY GOOD POINT ABOUT. MAYBETAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT IS THIS THE MOST EFFECTIVE. WAY TO ADD TO INAV TO SPEND WHAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF MONEY. AND YOU KNOW ARE THERE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN RELIEVE THE BURDEN THAT WOULD BE MORE EQUITABLE AND MORE EFFECTIVE. HI I GUESS I GUESS OLD THROUGH CHURCH THE SAME THING IT'S IT'S THE POT OF WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING PROSPECTIVELY AT THE COST OF EDUCATION WHICH IS IMPORTANT AND BRING THAT DOWN SO THAT YOU DON'T ENCOURAGED GET IN FIRST PLACE. AND THEN THE ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION THE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY IN DEBT WITH THERE'S NO PROGRAM YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGE THE DISCHARGED REALTY OF PRIVATE. LOANS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE BILL TRILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL DEBT THAT'S GONE UP THAT'S NOT BY ACCIDENT SO I'M JUST VERY NARROWLY. I WAS MORE REFERRING TO THE POINT ABOUT YOU MAKING IT A REFUNDABLE REFUNDABLE VERSES NON REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT SAID THAT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BENEFIT. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SPECTRUM AS WELL AS PEOPLE THAT. KNOW THAT ARE EARNING AN INCOME I WILL TAKE A IN DEPTH LOOK AT THAT. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL FIND DOCTOR KIRK HAS EDUCATED US ALL IN THIS COMMITTEE ON AND WE HAVE FOUND NORMALLY HE IS CORRECT ABOUT THAT. THE PROCESS OF THOSE WHO ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM SOME OF THESE WERE SOME OF THESE TAX CREDIT SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU. UP RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A QUORUM FOR REAL ACTUALLY THIS TIME SO. MR HI ONLY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WORK HERE. GROW HERE CHIU [inaudible] GRAY. MAYES MELENDEZ MULLIN PETRIE-NORRIS. QUIRK HERE. RIVAS. TING. WE HAVE A QUORUM I WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I WOULD WHEN YOU HAVE. TIME -- TO TO CONSIDER THE MEASURE I HOPE -- YOU LOOK AT IT POSITIVELY AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. MOVING TO FILE ITEM. NUMBER ONE SB THREE OH NINE THIS ITEM IS FOR REGULAR ORDER OF BUSINESS. SENATOR RUBIO WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. OF THE BILL. REAL QUICKLY JUST THANK YOU FOR FOR HAVING ME HERE JUST -- WANTED TO PRESENT SB THREE ONLINE WHICH WOULD REMOVE THE MINIMUM DONATION REQUIREMENT THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. MUST RACE IN ORDER TO REMAIN LISTED ON THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX FROM. FORM UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE OR CSL IS THE STATUTORY AUTHORIZED BY YOU DEDICATED TO ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND IT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF SIX I'M SORRY FIFTY FIVE TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE. IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND HELPS SHAPE POLICIES THAT AFFECT THEIR LIVES. THIS WONDERFUL PROGRAM BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THIS YEAR'S SO HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED ON VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS VIA THE INCOME TAX CHECK OFF. WHICH HAS PROVIDED NEARLY ALL FUNDING FOR ITS FOR I'M AN ADVOCACY PROGRAM. HOWEVER OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE CSO HAS RECEIVE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IN CONTRIBUTIONS AND THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CSL REMAINS. ON THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS LIST ONLY IF THE RECEIVED MORE THAN -- TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND I DO HAVE A WITNESS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IS THE YOU KNOW. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. COME ON UP. ARE YOU IN SUPPORT -- COME PLEASE RIGHT HERE TO THIS MY GRAY HERE THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY. ARE THE GUYS TALK FAST. WORK FAST TOO I'M IN WARRANT THE CHAIR OF THE LEDGE COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE AND I MET WITH MANY OF YOU. IN OUR WORK AND I TELL YOU THAT. AS A VOLUNTEER. I VOLUNTEERED TO COME UP HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU TO SAY I TO WANT YOU TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL AT MRS IN SUPPORT. HI AM ELEANOR BLOCK AND I BEEN ON THE CSL SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND I HOPE THAT YOU DO PASS THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. MR BRO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CENTER RUBIO IS THIS YOUR EXPERT WITNESS. I HAPPEN TO KNOW MISTER PORTER HE'S THE SEVENTY THIRD ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SENIOR LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE ALSO OUR PAST COMMANDER. THE AMERICAN LEGION POST TWO EIGHTY ONE AND AGAIN IN THE GAL AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS COULD SEE JOHN AND OF COURSE BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. AFTER QUIRK. SO WHAT IS THE MONEY USED FOR THAT COMES THROUGH THIS VOLUNTARY -- FIND. VOLUNTARY DONATION FUND WHAT IS IT USED. FOR I'M GONNA LAST. OUR EXPERT WITNESS TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU OKAY SO HISTORICALLY IT HAS BEEN USED TO FUND THE ORGANIZATION POTH. ROBBERY SIXPENCE AS AS WELL AS THE ADVOCACY. PIECE OF THAT WHICH INVOLVES OUR ANNUAL SESSION AND MEETING WITH LEGISLATORS TO FIND SPONSORS FOR OUR BILLS. AS YOU CAN SEE IN [inaudible] TWENTY FOURTEEN SOMETHING HAPPENED. AND WE BEGAN TO THEN SEE DIMINISHING RETURNS FROM THE VOLUNTARY TAX CHECK OFF. AND THEN WE BEGAN TO USE TEMPORARY FUNDING. THROUGH DOUBLE TRIPLE A ONE TO FUND THE ORGANIZATION UNTIL WE COULD RETURN. TO TAX CHECKOFF. FUNDS TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE. I PROVIDED A HISTORICAL REFERENCE THAT SHOWED THE FROM. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE RIGHT UP AND DOWNS. AND THEN I ALSO PROVIDED SOMETHING THAT SHOWED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT -- PROVIDED. FOR I WILL REFER TO IT AS THE CONTINUOUS FOR OUR FUNDING THROUGH THE TAX CHECK OFF. OF THE ANNUAL SESSION AND THE LEGISLATOR VISITS [inaudible] BUT WHAT. ALL RIGHT IS IT WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY PAYING FOR DON'T HAVE A PERMANENT EMPLOYEE. OKAY OKAY I HAVE -- EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRINTING POSTAGE ARE THERE IS TRAVEL INVOLVED IN BRINGING THE ALLEGE COMMITTEE AND THE J. R. C. JOINT RULES COMMITTEE WE THEN ALSO OR INVOLVED IN. FOR SOMETHING CALLED STATE FEES ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A STAFF TO PERFORM ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS LIKE HR ACCOUNTING FISCAL OUT WE ARE CHARGED INSTEAD. OF P.. THOSE FEES ARE ASSESSED AGAINST US OKAY SO MY CONCERN IS SO -- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU ONLY GOT. A NINETY ONE THOUSAND THROUGH APRIL OF THIS YEAR -- FIFTY ONE THOUSAND MY CONCERN IS THIS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY. NOW YOU ARE A STATE DEPARTMENT TAURUS STATE FUNCTION I THINK THIS SHOULD COME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. ARE THEY GIVE US TRAVEL MONEY AND PER DIEM AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE STAFF -- I THINK THIS WOULD JUST BE A BETTER SOLUTION. AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO LOOK INTO THAT NEXT YEAR AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET TRYING MAKE CASE FOR IT. MY CONCERN HERE IS TWO FOLD ONE IS. THERE BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF VERY GOOD -- INSTITUTIONS -- EIGHT THE LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE RESEARCH FIND MUNICIPAL SHELTERS SPAY NEUTER FOND. CALIFORNIA BILL POLICE ACTIVITIES LEAGUE FUND WHICH HAVE COME OFF. AND I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS SHOULD HAVE A A SPECIAL. DISPENSATION WHEN WE DON'T GIVE IT TO OTHERS -- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE THIS -- BUT I'M I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT THIS SETS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE GROUPS THAT COME OFF -- ARE WORTHWHILE GROUPS FURTHER WE NOW HAVE A LINE OF PEOPLE READY TO GO ON WHEN OTHER PEOPLE COME OFF. AND IF WE WERE TO GRANDFATHER IN THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THERE NOW -- IT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR JUST KEEPING. OTHER GROUPS OFF SO THIS IS A CONCERN I HAVE AND I REALLY DO THINK. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN FROM 200-500-0028 TO WHAT WAS IT. NINETY YEAH NINETY THOUSAND LAST YEAR TO FIFTY ONE THOUSAND SO FAR THIS YEAR. BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS A STATE SHOULD BE FUNDING. AND THAT'S SAD. I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE IN THE LONG RUN THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS CONSIDERING THAT THE FUNDS JUST AREN'T COMING MAN. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN I'M I'M I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT UP. FIRST THIS YEAR SO HAS BEEN PART OF THE ORIGINAL FOUR THERE WERE ON THE TAX CHECKOFF IN SINCE THEN. THERE'S BEEN TWO HUNDRED CSL PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED AND SIGNED INTO LAW SO. THEIR BODY OF WORK IN TERMS OF REPRESENTING THE SENIOR POPULATION EVERY WORKING TOWARDS LEGISLATION THAT'S MEANINGFUL AND YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT I I REALLY DO BELIEVE IN BUT HE I'M GONNA LET HIM ANSWER THAT THE PART IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING SOURCES AND HOW IT'S BEEN. DIMINISHING OVER THE YEARS -- THERE WERE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. JUST A REMINDER. WE WERE. WERE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NOW. THERE'S A THIS IS OUR PERCEPTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT. WE ARE BEING GIVEN FUNDS FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECT OF THE ORGANIZATION NOT THE ADVOCACY. PIECE. OUR SO WHAT MY NEXT. POINT TWO THERE IS AND THEN WHAT WE ARE. POINTING OUT IS THAT WE WERE ORIGINALLY ON THE TAX CHECK OFF. AS ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE NO MINIMUM. SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THE OTHER FUNDS WERE ADDED. TO THAT STATUS WE SOMEHOW LOST. THAT STATUS IT'S NEVER BEEN ABLE TO REGAIN THAT. THIRD JUST ANOTHER REMINDER -- WE'VE SEEN OUR REVENUE DIMINISH BY OVER 80% WITH. NO ONE ABLE. TO CONVEY TO US. WHAT WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED AS YU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE DONORS ARE? THAT'S PROTECTED UNDER THE FRANCHISE TAG ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY RIGHT AND THAT WE'RE WE'RE FACED WITH NOW IS. ATTEMPTING TO RESURRECT. THOSE AT DONOR BASE AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS EACH TIME. WE ARE NOT STATED WE LOSE A POSITION WE WERE NUMBER TWO OR NUMBER THREE ON THE TAX CHECK OFF FOR YEARS. HOW ACCORDING TO SENATOR MORLOCK THIS PRESENTATION WITH REGARD TO SB? TWO FORTY ONE WE'RE ONLY DEALING WITH A FINITE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ANYWAY. THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE TAX CHECK OFF IF HE'S RIGHT. OUR AND SO. OUR CONCERN IS THAT WHEN WE LOSE. SKEWS ME IF WE LOSE OUR POSITION. THEN WE START OVER AGAIN IN TERMS OF OUR MARKETING. BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER NUMBER TWO OR THREE WERE NOW TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT OR WHATEVER THE POSITION WILL BE AND SO THE MARKETING AGAIN SLIPS. AND YOUR RECOGNITION FACTOR IS GONE AS WELL SO WOULD YOU WOULD OPPOSE ME IF I WANTED TO ADD MORE MONEY TO YOUR BUDGET NEXT YEAR. ONE ISRAELI THAT THAT'S A BETTER SOLUTION -- SINCE YOU ARE SUNSET IN THIS IN -- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ALL I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BUT I I I ASK YOU TO WORK WITH ME NEXT YEAR AND TRYING TO GET YOUR BUDGET. INTO ALL OF YOUR FOR BUDGET INTO THE GENERAL FUND I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE. AREA I MEAN YOU KNOW I HAVE STAFF. THEY HELPED ME -- WORK FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE MY GOALS -- I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE STAFF FOR THAT AND I JUST THINK THAT'S A A BETTER SOLUTION BECAUSE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT'S GOING DOWN AND GOING DOWN PRECIPITOUSLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- BUT I THINK THAT IN THE LONG RUN THAT THAT WOULD BE A BIT BETTER SOLUTION THANK YOU. SEVEN AWRY WELCOME THAT OFFER. A AND WILL LOOK FOR DOING THAT. JUST ONE WATER REMINDER SO WE HAVE EVEN RESORTED TO A VENDOR. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY AND FIND THAT DONOR PLACE. STONE WE'RE WE'RE INCHING UP BUT WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA HIT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THIS YEAR WITH FIFTY ONE THOUSAND CURRENTLY IN THAT. IT HAS ARE MAY RESULT IN. IN MY HUMBLE OPINION SO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER WILL BE TALKING. TO GREAT AND I'M SURE MR BRO WILL BE -- WORKING WITH ME AS WELL. IT HAS ALWAYS [inaudible] MR MAYES. THE JUST QUICKLY I DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS WAS PART OF THE REASON WHY BUT I IS THERE SOME LEGAL QUESTION ABOUT USING DOLLARS THE TAX DOLLARS FOR ADVOCACY MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT IN THE BUDGET WHY IT'S PART OF THE NOW WHAT DOES YOUR STAFF DO ON YOUR BILLS. WELL THAT'S A LITTLE DO WELL YEAH EXACT DATE THEIR STATE STAFF IT'S A LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE PART OF IT SO ANYWAY WELL I I I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK INTO. I'M SORRY YES NO THAT'S OKAY HERE THAT -- THAT'S OKAY I'M A HANDLE THIS. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE CAN DO THAT. DOCTOR QUIRK AND MISTER BRO IF THAT IF THEY SO CHOOSE CAN HELP FIND A MORE SUSTAINABLE SOURCE. FOR FOR YOU ALL STAFF SO WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR YES THANK YOU AND I DO APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORKS QUESTIONS OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE HERE BUT I JUST WANT TO SHOW THESE LAST OUT THIS LAST PIECE OF INFORMATION THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA ESTIMATES THAT THE BY BY THE YEAR.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT ON FILE ITEM. SIX SB TWO FORTY EIGHT I LOST MY CROWD I LOST MY CROWD ON IT. YOU WILL YOU DON'T HAVE. TO MATTER TO VENTURE THANK YOU FOR AYE HERE IN THIS BILL I KNOW IT'S JUST A HEARING ONLY -- IT BUT IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE. THIS BILL IS SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT YOU CONSIDERED AND MOVE FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE RENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. RENTERS TAX CREDIT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO ONLY INCREASE ONCE. SINCE THEN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FORTY YEARS AGO. AND OF COURSE SINCE THEN RENTS HAVE FIVE GONE UP SUBSTANTIALLY SOME CASES TRIPLED. WHILE THE LEGISLATURE'S MADE STRIDES IN EXPANDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING LITTLES BEEN DONE TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES STRUGGLING WITH SKYROCKETING COSTS OF RENT. IS INSTEAD OF DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SINGLE AND JOINT -- FOR FILERS THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE THE CREDIT FOR THOSE WITH DEPENDENTS. MAKING THE CREDIT MORE HELPFUL IN FAIR TO SINGLE MOMS DADS AND FAMILIES. THE BILL MAKES THE RENTERS TAX CREDIT REFUNDABLE SO THAT EVEN THOSE WITHOUT A TAX OBLIGATION CAN RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF THE TAX CREDIT. OUR THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE RENTERS WHO DON'T GET A CREDIT TODAY TO GET ONE UNDER THIS BILL. AND WHILE WE'RE DOING A LOT OF CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO ADVANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A LOT OF THAT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME. AND HAVE A RENTERS TAX CREDIT CAN HELP SOMEBODY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. AND IT IS SUBJECT TO THE BUDGET AX SO -- THIS ONLY PROVIDES AN AUTHORIZATION AND EVERY YEAR WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO TO MAKE A CHOICE AS TO WHETHER WEWANT TO SUPPORT THAT -- CREDIT -- IN THE IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE GIVEN OUR BUDGET CIRCUMSTANCES. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS -- LEWIS -- MAYOR MIRANTE TAKE. FROM CALIFORNIA ME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LUIS MONTERO COMPANY M. B. I HERE AT TO SUPPORT I SB TWO FORTY EIGHT I THINK THE SENATOR DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF RECAPPING WHAT. THE BILL IS INTENDED TO DO BUT MAYBE I COULD JUST PROVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT FOR HOW THE STATE. TYPICALLY SPENDS ITS TAX EXPENDITURES ON THE ISSUE OF HOUSING. STILL IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES MOST RECENT TAX EXPENDITURE REPORT. YOU'LL FIND THAT JUST IN THE CATEGORY OF INCOME TAX EXEMPTIONS WHICH THIS WOULD BE. THERE IS ABOUT TWELVE POINT SIX SIX BILLION DOLLARS -- ALLOCATED -- FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP TAX EXPENDITURE ACTIVITIES SPREAD ACROSS THE SIX POINT NINE ONE HOME ON OCT OWNER OCCUPIED HOMES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO DOLLARS -- PER HOME. IN IN IN THAT SAME DOCUMENT GO FIND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED FOR THE RENTERS -- TAX CREDIT AT THE EXISTING ONE WHICH SPREAD ACROSS THE FIVE POINT -- EIGHT ONE RENTER MILLION RENTER OCCUPIED HOMES IS ABOUT TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND THIRTY EIGHT CENTS -- SO A PRETTY BIG DISPARITY THERE -- WE'RE SUPPORTING AS BE TWO FORTY EIGHT FOR THE REASON THAT IT PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TODAY -- AND HELPS CLOSE THAT GAP. I STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE THE THANK YOU IT IS NO IN IS IS IN SUPPORT. TWENTY BE WITH THE A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SO SHE CAN HEAR SUPPORT. TIM CAMERA WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC ADVISERS IN SUPPORT THANKS. RESIDENTS ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. BOB NEARING BATTLEFIELDS STIRLING COMPANY IN SUPPORT. IN THE GOING WITH CAPITAL ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR ROSANNA CARPACCIO -- ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF ALAMEDA ALSO IN SUPPORT [inaudible] WHEN OPPOSITION? SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. A CELL ASSEMBLY ARLAND AS WE'RE GONNA MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU THE GRIM REAPER HAS TO WAIT A MINUTE -- SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AGAIN I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL RECOGNIZE ON THIS COMMITTEE IN IN THESE CHAMBERS AT THIS HOUSING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE -- THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE IS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH IS NOT JUST ONE THING I WISH IT WAS OR WE COULD DO THAT BUT THIS THIS CERTAINLY IS GOING TO HELP THEIR A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BUY A HOME UNDER A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO CAN'T AFFORD HOME RIGHT NOW BUT REGARDLESS WE HAVE A LOT OF RENTERS OUT THERE? AND WE REALLY DO NEED TO BRING THESE IDEAS FORWARD AND TRY TO HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THE RESIDENTS AT THE RAN -- AND HELP THEM PERHAPS WORK TOWARD HOME HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT THIS IS THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SEEMS TO BE LEFT OUT A LOT ARE THE RUNNERS SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY WIDE SUPPORT. SHIP DOCTOR QUIRK. SO MY CONCERN HERE IS JUST THE LAWS OF ECONOMICS. SO YOU HAVE A DEMAND CURVE IN SUPPLY CURVE. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS INCREASE. IN. MONEY AVAILABLE TO RANCHERS WILL SIMPLY RESULT IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY OF RENTAL HOUSING WHICH THERE ISN'T [inaudible] THAT BASICALLY. I MEAN I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT READ THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE HOUSING. ARE GOING TO SAY WELL NOW WE CAN CHARGE MORE. AND THE PEOPLE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY AND YOU CAN CHARGE A LITTLE BIT MORE. SO MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS WOULD ALL BE TAKEN UP. IN THE FACT BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY TAKING IN THE RANTS. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS THE OTHER IS THAT IT'S SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND ARE THERE BETTER WAYS TO HELP OUT RANCHERS. YOU ALSO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF ALL THE MONEY THAT IS SPENT ON HOMEOWNERS. I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF ACTUALLY -- OVER TIME WE ARE THE ONLY DEVELOPED COUNTRY. THAT ALLOWS HOMEOWNERS THOSE TAX BREAKS IN BRITAIN DAVE -- TAKEN THEM OUT. ARE THEY DID IT OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS SO PEOPLE AT TIME TO ADJUST. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY FAIR THING TO DO I DON'T EXPECT THAT IT'S GOING TO PASS ANYTIME SOON -- BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS A BIG -- DISCREPANCY HERE BETWEEN HELPING THE MORE WEALTHY FOLKS. BUT THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION ABOUT. THE PRICE OF THESE HOMES FOR EXAMPLE MY SON IS LOOKING AT A HOME IN REDWOOD CITY. ARCHERY HALFWAY BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE TO BE LIVE. THE STAR HOME IS A MILLION AND A HALF. I'M WILLING TO BET THAT IF WE DIDN'T ALLOW TAX DEDUCTIONS ON THAT THE PRICES WOULD GO DOWN SO WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THAT I'M WORRIED THAT ALL OF THE SLACK. WHICH SIMPLY ALL OF THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY WOULD BE TAKEN OUT BY THE PEOPLE AROUND THE HOUSING. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER. HAPPY TO HAVE CHAIRS PERMISSION OF COURSE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOUR ANALYSIS ABOUT SUPPLY AND DEMAND IT'S REALLY THE BIG IT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM AND WE'RE CERTAINLY WORKING AT A FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND HAVE FOR FOR A COUPLE YEARS. BUT IT'S SLOW TO HAVE ITS EFFECT BUT LISTEN IF YOU'RE A RENTER IN YOUR PAIN 506070%. OF YOUR INCOME ON RENT. AND A BILL LIKE THIS COMES ALONG WITH ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP TO GET INSTEAD OF HAVING A SIXTY DOLLAR CREDIT. BUT TO GO UP TO FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR THAT THAT'S GONNA BE THAT'S GONNA BE A BIG HELP TO YOU AND IS IT GOING TO CHANGE THE THE PROFIT CURVE FOR A A LANDLORD. LOOK EVERYONE AND IS GOING TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES IN THE MARKET PLACE FOR THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN'T CONTROL THAT. BUT I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IN UNDER THIS BILL YOU'RE GONNA HELP TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. I THE LOWEST END OF THE ECONOMIC SCALE WHO ARE SUFFERING THE MOST SO DO WE NEED TO BUILD MORE -- OF HOUSING OF COURSE. BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING AND FORTY YEARS TO HELP THOSE IN THE LOWEST AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH THAT SINGLE MOMS AND DADS THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE THAT REFORM IN THE LAW. IT'S NOT THERE TODAY AT THE COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING THEM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I KNOW IT'S NOT A DECISION POINT TODAY. AND I ALSO WOULD JUST RECOGNIZE AGAIN THAT. THESE THINGS ARE SUBJECT TO THE BUDGET WE NOW WE HAVE LOTS OF CHOICES IN THAT IN THAT FRAMEWORK. BUT WE CAN PERFORM THE CREDIT TO HELP SINGLE MOMS AND DADS IN THIS BILL AND THEN HOPEFULLY WITH THE RIGHT -- ECONOMY AND AND CHOICES THAT WE CAN FIND AT EACH YEAR AND MAKE GOOD CHOICES THERE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. MOVING THE FINAL NINE SB FIVE TWENTY ONE SENATOR PORTANTINO WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT MY READING SORRY THANK YOU AYE MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I'M PRESENTING SB. FIVE TWENTY ONE WHICH WOULD ALLOW A TAX CREDIT TO A TAXPAYER THAT OWNS THE PROPERTY RENTED TO OR AT LEAST FIVE PERSONS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER SECTION. EIGHT THE UNITED STATES HOUSING ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN AN AMOUNT EQUAL 23% OF THE AMOUNT. OF RENT OR LEASE PAYMENTS AND LIMITED TO FIVE QUALIFIED PROPERTIES PER TAXPAYER PER TAXABLE YEAR -- WE KNOW THERE'S A HOUSING SHORTAGE WE THINK THIS IS AN INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ONE STATISTIC THEN THE CITY OF PASADENA -- THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES THAT WERE TAKING SECTION EIGHT THIS PAST YEAR DECREASED BY ONE HUNDRED SO THAT WAS A SERIOUS IMPACT. I THEY WERE FROM. THIRTEEN HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED WE SEEK TO TRY TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE AND EVEN OUT THE ECONOMICS. OF IT AND SO WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD APPROACH AND WOULD LOVE TO SET UP THE FRAMEWORK. AND AGAIN -- DISCUSS IT IN EACH BUDGET YEAR GOING FORWARD WITH ME I HAVE PETERS -- BACK REPRESENTING THE CITY OF GLENDALE WHICH BROUGHT THE IDEA TO MY ATTENTION AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I AM SURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU -- I THINK THE CENTER DID A VERY GOOD JOB AND AND PUTTING THE ISSUE FORWARD. I WOULD ONLY LIKE TO ADD THAT FOR MANY LANDLORDS THE DECISION TO ACCEPT A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. INTO THEIR PORTFOLIOS MOTIVATED PRIMARILY ON A COST BENEFIT BASIS AND IN THIS TIGHT HOUSING MARKET OF LANDLORDS ARE OPTING TO LOOK. AT THOSE THAT COULD PAY THE HIGHER RENT WE'VE SEEN MANY CASES IN WHICH TENANTS THAT WE'VE ISSUED VOUCHERS TO GO OUT TRY TO CONTRACT UP OF UNITS. COME BACK TURN THEIR VOUCHER BACK IN AFTER WAITING YEARS ON THE WAITING LIST PROGRAM SAY THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE UNIT. MAINLY DUE TO THE RIGHT LEVELS THAT ARE DICTATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN THIS FORMULA. WE THINK THAT THIS TARGETED TAX INCENTIVE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP PLACE SECTION EIGHT TENANTS IN CALIFORNIA -- ON A CLOSER TO EQUAL GROUND -- IT WHEN WHEN THEY ARE OUT THERE -- TRYING TO SECURE UNIT WITH THEIR SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY TO PASS THE NUMBER BANK ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL.
