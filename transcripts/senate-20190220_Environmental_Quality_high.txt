THIS IS THE FIRST SOLO HEARING OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE OF A VERBAL QUALITY COMMITTEE OF THE OF THE TERM SO WE WANT TO BEGIN BY ADOPTING THE COMMITTEE RULES. AND BUT I I THINK WE NEED TO CALL ROLE FIRST. SO BEFORE WE EVEN A DOCTOR. RECEDED. THE STATUS OF CORN. I AM ALLEN HERE BATES HILL. STONE. MY CASKEY HERE. OKAY SO WE'VE GOT A QUORUM THAT'S FANTASTIC -- WITHOUT OBJECTION WILL WILL -- LAST THE THE SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL ON THE COMMITTEE RULES. OKAY. ALLEN. I BATES [inaudible] HILL. HILL AYE STONE AYE STONE AYE WIECKOWSKI. AYE CASKEY AYE. IN SENATE RESIDUE OF A VISOR VOTE. ON THIS NOW. OKAY RECEIVED THAT. I WANT TO SAY I I I DO APPRECIATE YOUR THE PRESENCE OF SENATE GLAZER WHO IS NOT ON THIS COMMITTEE BUT IS IS INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE WITH IS ACTUALLY AT OUR AT OUR RETREAT -- WE TALKED ABOUT SEVERAL THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND I WAS IN A SMALL BREAKOUT GROUP OF CENTER GLAZERS VERY. THOUGHTFUL AS AS EVER AND AND I THOUGHT YOU'D ENJOY BEING HERE AND BEING A PART OF THIS DISCUSSION I REALLY DO APPRECIATE DRIVING IN FROM YOUR DISTRICT APPEAR. AS I HOPE IS GOING TO BE A FRUITFUL INTERESTING CONVERSE A TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND IT'S THAT CALIFORNIA'S PATH AS AN INTERNATIONAL LEADER AND PARTICIPANT REDUCING GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THEN OF COURSE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA AND SOLIDIFIED ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE ON CLIMATE CHANGEWHEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN THE GOVERNOR. SIGNED SB THIRTY TWO WHICH REQUIRES THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO ENSURE THAT STATEWIDE GHG EMISSIONS ARE REDUCED BY AT LEAST 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. BY. TWENTY THIRTY BY THE END OF TWENTY THIRTY THIS IS THE SB THIRTY TO TARGET THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING TODAY [inaudible] NOW -- WHY ARE WE HERE SPECIFICALLY WELL THE CHAIR OF THE A. R. B. MADE SOME VERY INTERESTING REMARKS -- THEIR BOARD MEETING BACK IN DECEMBER -- WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING AT AMENDMENTS THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM? POST TWENTY TWENTY AND A CHAIR SAID I WILL QUOTE. WE HAVE A LOT MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAT WE NEED GOING FORWARD WE KNOW WE NOW KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT ON A LINE THAT'S GOING TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET MUCH LESS THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STEP BACK AND TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THE ROLE THE CAP AND TRADE ANOTHER MEASURES PLAY. IN GETTING US TO THAT POINT. I'M SURE GOES OUT SAYING THAT REGARDLESS OF THE DETAILS THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM A. R. B. REMAINS STATUTORILY OBLIGATED TO ENSURE. THAT CALIFORNIA MEETS THE TWENTY THE THE SB THIRTY TO TARGET -- IN YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS REALLY OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO HEAR FROM THE CHAIR CAN FLESH OUT. THE THOUGHTS BEHIND THOSE COMMENTS AT THE BOARD MEETING AND THEN HAVE A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT WE MEET THESE SB THIRTY TWO GOALS THAT ARE ARE SO IMPORTANT. SO WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM CHAIR NICHOLS WE'RE GONNA HERE -- WE'RE WALKS THE FIRST YEAR OF LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEMS A POLICIES FROM THE LA -- WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM CARE NICHOLS. AND HOPEFULLY HEAR FROM HER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU CAN ENSURE THAT WE MEET THE GOALS -- AND WHAT SORT OF ASSISTANCE OR INTERVENTION THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE AUDA AUDA CONSIDER. WE'RE THEN GOING TO HEAR FROM THE SENATE'S APPOINTEE TO THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET. ADVISORY COMMITTEE THE IT MAC. ABOUT BOTH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ON WHICH THE I MAC ADVISE THEIR B. AS WELL AS THE STATE'S OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA LASTLY HERE FROM A PANEL ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC FEASIBILITY OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IN THE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED. TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. SO SHOULD BE A REALLY INTERESTING DISCUSSION I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO IT A GREAT DEAL I I WANT TO THANK MISTER SEE ANOTHER'S FOR ALL THEIR HELP ON PREPARING THE BACKGROUNDER. AND WITHOUT OF LOVE -- TO GIVE MY COLLEAGUES OPPORTUNITY MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS TO LIKE TO MAKE OR OKAY ALL RIGHT. YES JUDGE AND AND I I NAY OBVIOUSLY MAJOR SHOUT OUT TO MY THE FORMER CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES THE BUDGET IN THIS AREA -- MR CASKEY THANK YOU CHAIRMAN -- ALLEN AND I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR A COUPLE OF INTRODUCTORY MARKS I'VE BEEN YOU KNOW. DEEPLY INVOLVED IN -- CLIMATE CHANGE DISCUSSIONS AND EIGHT YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE IN -- IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT WE AS A BODY AND IS THE STATE NEED TO DO MORE TO MEET THE CLIMATE GOALS THAT WE SET OUT IRAQ COP TWENTY FOUR IN KATOWICE POLAND -- JUST TWO MONTHS AGO. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THE SPEAK WITH A NUMBER SPEAK IN AN ON THE NUMBER OF THE FORMS BUT ALSO SOME OF THE DELEGATES THAT WOULD THERE. WITH THE HOUSE OF NATIONALS THAT PARTICIPATED IN OTHER ADVOCATES AND THEY ALL HAD ONE CONTINUOUS CHORUS WAS THAT WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DOING WHAT IT WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP. AND IT'S WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT THE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN AN IMPEDIMENT TESTS ARE REACHING OUR A COMICAL SO WHETHER IT'S THE COLD RELAXATION ORDER. TODAY THIS MORNING'S NEWS ABOUT THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IT'S LIKE BE GOING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR ELECTRIFICATION -- FROM THE FUEL STANDARDS IN THE POWER PLANT EMISSIONS THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM OF LITERALLY SETTING OUR NATION BACK GENERATIONS BY THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE TAKEN SO EVERYONE IS LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA TO LEAD. THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUR POLICIES AND ARE PROGRAMS THEY CAN THAT THEY CAN EMULATE AN ADOPT AND DO A COPY CAT ON AND THEY ALL WANT TO KNOW. TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW HOW WE ADJUSTING ARE ARE THE PAUL WHOEVER POLICY FOR TWENTY THIRTY BUT HOW WE ADJUSTING OUR PROGRAMMING. SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S AS THE BACKGROUNDER OF THE AT TO THE COMMITTEE -- POINTS OUT THE CAPTURE PROGRAM IS PROVIDING PRACTICALLY NO BENEFIT TO REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GASES IT PLACES A GREAT WHICH PLACES A GREATER BURDEN ON OUR STATE AGENCIES IN THE LEGISLATURE'S TO PROMULGATE CAPEN. OR COMMAND CONTROL MECHANISMS TO CALL FOR GREATER REDUCTIONS. IN IN POLLUTION AND AT A GREATER SPEED TO TAKE FROM FROM - THE COP IT BRING BACK IS -- IS MORE ACUTE -- STAFF REMINDS US THAT THE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN HAS UPPED. THE INDICATED THAT THE ROLE THE CAP AND TRADE IS GET A PET PLAYS NOW 38% THIS WAS WE WERE IN SINGLE DIGIT THIS WAS ALWAYS MUST BE THE FALL BACK PROGRAM. AND A REGULAR PROGRAMS WERE SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE THE LION'S SHARE SO IT'S A CHALLENGE BEFORE US -- AND I LOOK FOR FROM HEARING FROM THE PANELISTS MISTER CHAIR WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- YOU KNOW -- AND WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE. DOCTOR STONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CHALLENGE THE THREE NEW SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE RECALL -- DEPENDING ON US THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. I I DO WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE AND SALUTE THE THE PAST CONTINUED AND FUTURE LEADERSHIP THAT A SINGLE CASKEY AS AS PROVIDED IN THIS AREA AND THIS HAS BEEN A REAL PASSION FOR HIM. AND I KNOW HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO PLAY IT REALLY IMMENSELY IMPORTANT ISSUE PRO WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING HAND IN GLOVE TOGETHER. ON ON THESE ISSUES -- BOTH ON THIS COMMITTEE AND AND ELSEWHERE AND SO ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU BYE. OKAY LET'S GET STARTED WITH ROSS BROWN WHO'S THE PRINCIPAL FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LA ELSE WAS GOING TO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A REVIEW -- AS TO THE I SAID THE POLICY LANDSCAPE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I A WE PUT TOGETHER A BRIEF HANDOUT FOR TODAY'S PRESENTATION SO YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT AS PART OF YOUR INFORMATION IF YOU DON'T PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BE HAPPY. TO DISTRIBUTE OR GIPSON EXTRA COPIES TO THE SERGEANT TO PASS OUT -- THERE'S A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER HERE. THERE'S A LOT OF POLICIES WHAT ISSUES TO DISCUSS -- I'M GONNA TRY TO MOVE THROUGH THE INFORMATION THE HAND OUT PRETTY QUICKLY -- BUT I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS -- MINUTE JUST EVERYONE DISHES TERRIBLE IT IS A QUESTION BUT HOW DO WE GET THESE A LITTLE EARLIER -- SO WE CAN. HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH THE LA -- IN TERMS OF I MEAN WHAT WE WILL TRY TO GET THEM TO YOU AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON ON YOU KNOW HOW FAR IN ADVANCE IS MOST HELPFUL FOR YOU TO GET IT. TO GET IT TO YOU -- YEAH WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF BALANCE SOME OTHER WORKLOADS SO SOMETIMES THE TYPE TIME LINES WILL GET A LITTLE BIT TIGHT BUT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO TRY AND GET IT TIMELINE AS IS MOST HELPFUL FOR YEARS ITSELF TO START AFTER I STARTED OR NO NO. PROBLEM ALLEN AND BY THE WAY THAT THEIR PRESENTATION IS ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL FOR ANYBODY DOES NOT A COPY RIGHT NOW -- SON'S GONNA WALK THROUGH QUICKLY TO SOME BACKGROUND ON KIND OF OVERALL EMISSIONS WERE EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN WHAT THE NATURE STATE POLICIES ARE AND GET INTO A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE FINDINGS THAT WE'VE. HAD IN SOME OF THE REPORTS THAT WE'VE ISSUED IN RECENT YEARS JUST OOKING AT THE STATE'S POLICIES MENTAL ISSUES FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. SO REAL QUICKLY PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT I'M GONNA SKIP OVER REALLY QUICKLY THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF EMISSIONS AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES -- TRANSPORTATION BEING THE LARGEST -- PAGE -- TO THE CHAIR COVERED KIND OF THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS ARE NOT GONNA GO OVER THOSE. IN ANY MORE DETAIL AGAIN CARB ALSO HAS A REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SCOPING PLAN TO LAY OUT THE PLAN FOR HOW THE STATE WILL ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS -- THE BOX AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT INCLUDES A KIND OF HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IT'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. CAP AND TRADE FRIDAY POLICIES AROUND SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS LIKE METHANE EMISSIONS. A RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD -- INCENTIVES AND REGULATIONS AROUND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH TARGETS -- LOWERING CARBON INTENSITY IN TRANSPORTATION FUELS WHICH IS A REGULATION DEVELOP BY CARBON -- VARIOUS VEHICLE RELATED PROGRAMS IN THE LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. AS WELL AS POLICIES AROUND REDUCING VEHICLES MILE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT THIS JUST GIVES -- GRAPHICAL SUMMARY OF WHAT THE STATE'S TARGETS ARE -- IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY THIRTY AND THEN WHAT ACTUAL MISSIONS HAVE BEEN SINCE -- A. B. THIRTY TWO PASSED SO YOU CAN SEE MISSIONS HAVE GONE DOWN AND GOOD NEWS THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE STATE MATT IT'S TWENTY TWENTY TARGET AND EMISSIONS WERE BELOW THE ANY -- SIXTEEN I THINK JUST ANOTHER KEY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS CHART IS JUST THE LEVEL OF AMBITION GOING DOWN TO THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL SO JUSTIN. ANNUAL TERMS THE KIND OF YOU KNOW ANNUAL REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO HIT THAT -- TWENTY TWENTY TARGET ARE ABOUT AT PRODUCTIONS -- NEEDED TO GET THAT TO THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET IT'S CLOSER 24% PER YEAR SO MUCH MORE AMBITION AMBITIOUS TARGET. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND OUT THIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF KIND OF WHERE -- WHAT WE'RE EMISSIONS ABANDONED SECTORS -- DIFFERENT SOURCES OF EMISSIONS -- PLAYED A KEY THING TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE DARK LINE IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS -- EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRICITY THAT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO FAR -- TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO GOING DOWN SOME ALTHOUGH IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IT'S PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT -- AND SOME OF THE OTHER MAJOR CATEGORIES OF REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT SO THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS ELECTRICITY AND MOST OF THOSE OF THOSE REDUCTIONS OF COME FROM. A REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONSFROM IMPORTED ELECTRICITY. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT. OF THIS JUST SUMMARIZES -- SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL NOW CARBS MODELING AND THEIR TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN -- THAT THE CHAIR MENTIONED -- THE CUMULATIVE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE -- AND CAR BEST MATES WOULD BE NEEDED TO MEET THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL ARE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION METRIC TONS. OF THE BIGGEST POLICIES THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS TO HELP HELP ACHIEVE THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE CAP AND TRADE A 38%. OF RADIO OF POLICIES AROUND SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AT 35%. AND THEN -- OTHER POLICIES RELATED TO MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS -- RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY. ARE. A LITTLE BIT SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF KIND OF THE OVERALL CUMULATIVE MISSION REDUCTIONS -- THAT IT FORECAST WOULD BE NEEDED TO MEET THE STATE'S GOALS -- DOING HIGHLIGHT JUST A COUPLE THINGS. THE ANALYSIS DONE BY CAR DOES FOCUS ON CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS SO IT'S KIND OF THE OVERALL AGGREGATE EMISSIONS. YEAR OR YEAR AND YEAR -- YEAR OVER YEAR -- AND THE FOCUS ON IN THAT ANALYSIS IS NOT EXPLICITLY ON KIND OF THE ANNUAL MISSIONS IN THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS. IS THE STATE'S STATUTORY TARGET NOW THERE IS A A STRONG SORT OF SCIENTIFIC BASIS AND AND HAVE AN INTEREST IN FOCUSING ON Q. MOTIVE EMISSIONS GIVEN THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. TO STAY IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND SO THERE'S THERE'S ABOUT COMMITTED EMISSIONS OVER TIME WE JUST WANNA SORT OF HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S NEAR THE STATE'S GOALS ARE EXPRESSED IN ANNUAL AN ANNUAL TERMS AS WE WILL GET TO IN A LITTLE BIT ON NOT CREATES A BIT OF ATTENTION AND KIND. OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS SET UP PARTICULARLY CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT MIGHT ACTUALLY CHIEF THAT ANNUAL TARGET AND TWENTY THIRTY FINALLY -- THE SCOPE AND PLAN IDENTIFIES pCAP AND TRADE AS SORT OF THE POLICY TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE NEEDS ITS TWENTY THIRTY GOAL SO IT'S SORT OF A HIGHLIGHTED AS KIND OF THE THE BACKSTOP FOR THE THE THE TOOL IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE WHERE OTHER POLICIES. AREN'T ACHIEVING -- AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF REDUCTIONS TO MEET THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL CAP AND TRADE WILL SORT OF PICK UP THE REST OF THE REMAINDER THAT ARE NEEDED TO TO MEET THE STATE'S GOALS. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR HAND OUT. GO BRIEFLY THROUGH -- SOME REPORTS THAT WE'VE ISSUED AND HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE KEY TAKEAWAYS -- FIRST -- JUST KIND OF ON THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF THE HE'S JUST -- BY WAY OF BACKGROUND. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT THE BILL THAT EXTENDED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN ESTABLISHED A REQUIREMENT FOR OUR OFFICE. TO ANNUALLY ASSESS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND BENEFITS OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE POLICIES AND GHG TARGETS. AND SO THIS DECEMBER LAST DECEMBER WE ISSUED A COUPLE REPORTS -- ONE OF THEM WAS JUST KIND OF PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE GENERAL TYPES OF A FAX. THAT STATE CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE AND SO THAT'S VERY COMPILER WILL IN GENERAL DISCUSSION. OF THE THE TYPES OF TEXAS STATE POLICIES -- AND WHAT WE COULD CUT SEE ABOUT NEAR THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE AFFECTS SOME OF THE KEY TAKEAWAYS ARE ARE REALLY I THINK THAT THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF STATE CON A PIECE. ON A POLICY SO FAR UNCLEAR -- AND THAT'S FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- ONE IS THAT JUST THE POLICIES HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF AFFECTS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- THERE ARE -- REDUCTIONS DIED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS AS WELL. THERE'S A VARIETY OF COSTS INCLUDING KIND OF DIRECT FINANCIAL COSTS MAYBE IN A MORE EXPENSIVE SOURCE OF ENERGY AND SO THERE'S KIND OF A DIRECT HIRE FINANCIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING THAT. AS WELL AS MORE CAN KIND OF IMPLICIT OR INDIRECT COSTS SAID FOR EXAMPLE IF -- ENERGY IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MAYBE HOUSEHOLDS WILL ADJUST THE THERMOSTAT OR ON THEIR H. BACK A LITTLE BIT LASSEN SO THERE'S SORT OF A A CHANGE IN SORT OF COMFORT -- BENEFIT THAT SOMEONE MIGHT GET FROM THAT TO LIVE JUST OF A WIDE VARIETY OF AFFECTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE POLICIES. ARE OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE -- AND THAT GETS TO OF THE LAST SECTION HONEST ON PAGE SIX IS THE KEY CHALLENGES AN ESTIMATE IN THOSE POLICY AFFECTS. OTHERS A WIDE VARIETY OF THEM AND THEN TRYING TO TEASE OUT. WHAT THE SPECIFIC AFFECT OF A PARTICULAR POLICY A PARTICULAR GROUP OF POLICIES IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT? GIVEN THE CHANGES AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES ANOTHER TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS SOME OF WHICH ARE UNRELATED TO THE STATE'S KIND OF POLICIES THEMSELVES AND SO SIR TRYING TO TEASE ALL THOSE OUT AS A AS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. ON PAGE SEVEN WE TALK ABOUT TO SOME OTHER CHALLENGES IN TRYING TO KIND OF COME UP WITH A NUMBER ON KIND OF WHAT THE OVERALL ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE POLICIES ARE -- INCLUDING TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR A IMPACTS ON EMISSIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS -- AND EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AND AS WELL AS CONSIDERING SOME OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT STATE POLICIES AND OTHER FEDERAL POLICIES. I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO PAGE -- EIGHT SOME COMMENTS ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM A COUPLE OF LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO WE ISSUED A REPORT -- HIGHLIGHTING SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM -- DOING A STATE UP FRONT -- AS AN OFFICE WE THINK OF ECONOMY WIDE PRICING POLICY LIGHT CONCENTRATE IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE POLICY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. GIVEN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT -- POTENTIAL EFFECTS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT POLICIES AND THE DIFFICULTY IN ESTIMATING THOSE WE THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT OF VALUE AND A PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY AND PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE TO DIFFERENT BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE. WITH COSTLY TO THEM AND SO RELYING ON A KIND OF FLEXIBLE ECONOMY WIDE MARKET PRICES PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AND WE THINK IT'S THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY AND IN MOST CASES -- BUT THAT SAID -- AND ARGUE CAP AND TRADE LIKELY IS NOT PLAYED A PRIMARY ROLE IN EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO FAR -- THE PRICES HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY LOW AND NOW THEY HAVE HAD AN EFFECT YOU DO STILL HAVE A PRICE ON A MISSION SO I DO THINK THEY ARE HAVING AN EFFECT BUT THE PRICE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW -- BECAUSE EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN BELOW THAT OF THE PROGRAM -- OTHER FACTORS LIKE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS ANOTHER ON THE POLICIES OF THE STATE IS IMPLEMENTED ARE. LIKELY -- MAJOR DRIVERS AND COST EMISSIONS TO REMAIN BELOW CAPS FROM EXACTLY WHICH ONE OF THOSE FACTORS IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY BUT THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT -- ARE LIKELY DRIVING -- HAVE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DOWNWARD TREND IN EMISSIONS -- THE DETAILS OF THE POST TWENTY TWENTY CONCENTRATE IMPLEMENTATION -- WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS -- SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM. AND SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE WE HIGHLIGHT SOME KIND OF KEY ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AND OVERSIGHT -- MANY OF THE KEY IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS HAVE A KEY TRADE OFFS JUST BETWEEN COSTS AND EMISSION REDUCTIONS OR EMISSIONS CERTAINTY. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE BALANCE THAT -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND CARBON -- WILL HAVE TO STRIKE IN A LOT OF THESE DECISIONS. I'M JUST GONNA HIGHLIGHT TWO OF THEM IN THE SECOND BULLET. I'LL WE DISCUSS MANAGING ALLOWANCE PRESENCE CERTAINTY. SO GIVEN THE MORE STRANGE -- FUTURE PRICES ALTHOUGH THEY'RE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY. NAME MIGHT HAVE TO INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE ADOPTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO MEET THE STATE'S. TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND SO -- TRYING TO SORT OF AGAIN BALANCE -- THOSE HIGHER PRICES WITH THE EMISSIONS AND CERTAINTY IS A KEY CHALLENGE AND I THINK ONE QUESTION -- FOR THE LETTERS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT FOR CAR BAR AND OF ARE THE TOOLS FOR MANAGING ALLOWANCE PRICES SUCH AS A PRICE FLOOR PRICE CEILING. AND SO CALLED SPEED BUMPS ARE THEY SAID AT LEVELS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE LEGISLATURE BALANCES THOSE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN -- WHAT WHAT THE OVERALL COSTS ARE AND CERTAINTY AROUND MEETING THOSE EMISSIONS TARGETS ND SO -- THAT'S ONE ONE KEY AREA FOR OVERSIGHT THE SECOND ONE A HIGHLIGHT AS IS THE FIRST BULLET ON YOUR PAGE -- IS SENDING THE EMISSIONS CAPS AND THE KEY QUESTION AND OUR VIEWERS ARE THE PROGRAM CAPS AT A LEVEL THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATUTORY TWENTY THIRTY ANNUAL TARGET TEN OUT THIS IS JUST KIND OF A GRAPHICAL ILLUSTRATION OF OF I THINK SORT OF ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS HERE. IS JUST THIS QUESTION AROUND WHETHER A LARGE NUMBER OF THANKED ALLOWANCES IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM INCREASES THE RISK OF EXCEEDING THE STATE'S ANNUAL TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. SO JUST TO KIND OF WALK YOU THROUGH THIS FIGURE THE THE MORE STEEP LINE -- WHAT'S GONNA STARTS OUT AT THE TOP OF THE LEFT AND THEN -- GOES DOWN TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET -- THOSE ARE KIND OF THE THE ANNUAL PROGRAM CAPS. FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THE SHALLOW LINE THAT IS KIND OF A AN EXAMPLE EMISSIONS SCENARIO WHERE EMISSIONS ARE STILL DECLINING AND IN THE FIRST SEVERAL YEARS OF THE PROGRAM EMISSIONS THE GOOD THING THAT EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN BELOW THE CAPS BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT. THERE'S A KIND OF BANK OF ALLOWANCES THEY'RE BUILT UP THAT YEARS. AND SO -- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN GET OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY IF THERE'S A LARGE BANK OF ALLOWANCES THAT CAN THEN BE USED IN LATER YEARS THEN. YOU CAN MEET OUR SORT OF OVERALL CUMULATIVE. EMISSIONS GOALS SET OUT BY THE PROGRAM BUT WHEN HE REACHED TWENTY THIRTY YOUR ANNUAL EMISSIONS MIGHT NOT BE ON THE TRAJECTORY THAT YOU WANT -- AND AND THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR SB THIRTY TWO TARGETS. SO THAT'S KIND OF A WE THINK A KEY QUESTION. FOR CARBON AND JUST FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS IS THE PROGRAM SET UP IN A WAY. THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND THE LEVEL OF AMBITION ABOUT TARGET. SO -- PAGE ELEVEN MOVE THROUGH THERE'S NO WE HAVEN'T WE ISSUED ANOTHER REPORT FOCUSING MORE SPECIFICALLY ON THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION POLICIES. ON THE CHART ON PAGE ELEVEN GIVES YOU A SENSE OF JUST THE WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TRANSPORTATION RELATED SPECIFIC YET SHE POLICIES THAT THE STATE HAS. INCLUDING LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS REGULATIONS INCENTIVES -- INFRASTRUCTURE. HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE VOUCHERS FOR A CLEANER HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AS WELL AS PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS. LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED SO I WILL GO THROUGH THOSE IN DETAIL BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE THE RANGE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. PAGE TWELVE OF THE HAND OUT -- JUST SUMMARIZES SOME OF OUR KEY TAKE AWAYS AFTER HAVING REVIEWED THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION OF LITERATURE ON ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THOSE PROGRAMS. AGAIN THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECTS ARE LARGELY ON CLEAR THERE ARE CLEARLY SOME BENEFIT SOME SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAMS AS pSISTER TRYING TO PINPOINT WHAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE ARE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF THE REASONS THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE TRYING TO SORT OF TEASE OUT. THE EFFECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. RELATIVE TO OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES IN GASOLINE PRICES AND OTHER FACTORS. IS DIFFICULT -- THERE'RE. WORSE SOME MORE SORT OF PROSPECTIVE ANALYSES TRYING TO SORT OF FORECAST WHAT THE EFFECTS OF THESE PLICIES WILL BE ONCE ARE IMPLEMENTED. I TINK ONE GAP THAT WE IDENTIFIED AS THAT THEY'RE NOT MANY ESTIMATES OF ACTUAL PROGRAM AFFECTS AFTER THEIR IMPLEMENTED AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY BUT WE SEE THAT THIS AS ONE OF SIGNIFICANT GAP IN KIND OF THE OF STATE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT HAVE THE EFFECTS. OF THESE POLICIES BEEN WHAT'S EFFECTIVE OTHERS RELATIVELY LIMITED NUMBER OF TRYING TO KIND OF RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES LOOKING BACK ON ON WHAT HAS THE PROGRAM ACHIEVED -- AND THOSE ARE DIFFICULT AND SOMETIMES CAN REQUIRE YOU KNOW VERY ADVANCE TO TO SINGLE TECHNIQUES OR MAYBE ON IN THE EARLY STAGES OF PROGRAM EXPANSION OR DEVELOPMENT TRYING TO SORT OF SET UP THE PROGRAM AS AS A PILOT AND TRYING TO SORT OF SET UP THAT WAY TO TRY. TO EVALUATE THE PRO EXCUSE ME. OF THE LARGE NUMBER POLICIES -- TARGETING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS CREATES A VARIETY OF OF CHALLENGES INCLUDING JUST CHALLENGES TRYING TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF EACH PARTICULAR PROGRAM -- AND POTENTIAL LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN -- DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT OPERATE A SIMILAR TYPES OF PROGRAMS. HOLDON MOVE ON QUICKLY -- FINALLY ON PAGE -- THIRTEEN THE THERE'S NOT ALWAYS GREAT EVIDENCE ON THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF EACH PROGRAM BUT BASED ON THE THE EVIDENCE THAT WE DID FIND ON THE COSTS OF REDUCING THE A TON OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN EACH PROGRAM -- MANY OF THE POLICIES OR SOME OF THE POLICIES ARE RELATIVELY COSTLY WAYS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- RELATIVE TO FOR EXAMPLE A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM -- HOWEVER IT CAN THEY COULD BE VALUABLE ANOTHER -- CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE -- SOME OF THE POLICIES COULD BE VALUABLE AND KIND OF PROMOTING ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE A CARBON PRICE ON ITS OWN EXAMPLE -- RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES PARTICULARLY EARLIER STAGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OR PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS. EVEN WITH A CARBON PRICE THERE MAY NOT BE SORT OF AN ADEQUATE INCENTIVE AND PRIVATE. PRIVATE ENTITIES MAY NOT INVEST IN THOSE THINGS AND SO THERE MAY BE A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT. TO KIND OF PROMOTE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND THOSE TYPES OF KIND OF ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE INNOVATION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- OTHER AREAS ARE CO POLLUTANTS AGAIN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT SHE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS. IN REDUCING POLLUTANTS AND SO -- YOU KNOW I HAD TO EXTENT PROGRAMS ARE SIR TARGETED AT THOSE THOSE BENEFITS THEY THEY MIGHT BE VALUABLE -- IN THAT REGARD. FINALLY PAGE -- FOURTEEN JUST SOME HIGH LEVEL -- ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AGAIN WE THINK USING RELYING ON A COMPANY WIDE CARBON PRICING -- WOULD ACHIEVE LOW COST GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION-REDUCTIONS I'LL AND COST EFFECTIVENESS IN OUR VIEW IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS THE GOALS. BECOME MORE AMBITIOUS AND THE TARGETS BECOME MORE AMBITIOUS OUT -- TO TWENTY THIRTY WERE WARY THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IMPLEMENTING COUPLE COMPLIMENTARY POLICIES AND BUT CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY'VE. IDENTIFIED A AN AREA WHERE CARBON PRICING DOESN'T ADEQUATELY SORT OF ENCOURAGE -- COST EFFECTIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS -- FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER -- ONE OTHER ISSUE WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS -- AND ARGUE THERE SHOULD. LIKE WHAT IS THAT WOULD MEAN COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES WHAT SO YEAH SEVENTY YEAR. RIGHT SO I THINK. THE WAY WE VIEW IT AS THINKING ABOUT WHAT CARBON PRICING DOES AND WHAT IT DOESN'T DO. AND YOU KNOW CARBON PRICING CAN KIND OF ENCOURAGE -- VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS ONE THING THAT. A COMMUNIST WILL OFTEN POINT TO THAT PRICING DOESN'T DO FOR EXAMPLE IS -- EVEN WITH A PRICE ON CARBON THERE MAY JUST BE AN UNDER INVESTMENT IN KIND OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- THAT'S ONE I THINK COMMON EXAMPLE ON JUST BECAUSE SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF INVESTING. AND MORE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION WILL SOMETIMES SPILL OVER TO OTHER FIRMS OR AND SO -- YOU KNOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR ON ITS OWN MIGHT TEND TO UNDER INVEST IN THOSE AREAS AND SO -- YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE'S SORT OF FOCUSING AND SOME OF IT'S A NON CARBON PRICING POLICIES ON WAYS TO KIND OF PROMOTE THAT TYPE OF INNOVATION OR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- IT'S KIND OF ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT SORT OF YOU KNOW HOW. TO YOU KNOW HOW TO KIND OF WRAP OTHER POLICIES AROUND CARBON PRICING -- THERE'S I THINK THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER -- ARGUMENT I THINK -- FOR SOME FEELING AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO MY COMMENTS WILL POINT TO THE SUN. KIND OF AFFECTS OF YOU KNOW YOU NEED THE FILLING STATION OR THE CART WHICH ONE COMES FIRST SORT OF THE THE FILLING STATION OR THE VEHICLES AND THERE MIGHT BE A RATIONALE FOR GOING TO TRYING TO PROMOTE SERGEANT CHARGING FOR EXAMPLE YEAH -- BUT TRYING TO SORT OF IDENTIFY WE AWAY THOSE GAPS ARE AND WHAT WHAT CARBON PRICING DOESN'T ACHIEVE ON ITS OWN AND THEN TRYING TO SORT OF FIT THE POLICIES -- TO TO TO THOSE PARTICULAR GAPS. AND SO FOLKS IN POLICIES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO ENCOURAGE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS -- I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE THE LEGISLATURE THINKS ABOUT THAT WE JUST WANTED. TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT -- GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA BEING ABOUT 1% OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THAT LIKELY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AFFECT HAVE IS ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT ENCOURAGES EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND SO -- HOW TO DO THAT IS NOT ALWAYS AN EASY QUESTION AND NOT ALWAYS AN EASY QUESTION TO ANSWER -- BUT MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHICH FOR EXAMPLE WHICH POLICIES ARE LIKELY TO SERVE AS A DEMONSTRATION FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHICH ONES ARE LIKELY TO BE. ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND KIND OF FOCUS ON ON THOSE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE -- AS WELL AS POLICIES AGAIN. THAT MIGHT PROMOTE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN THEN BE USED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND THINKING ABOUT -- WHICH POLICIES ARE MOST EFFECTIVE AT DOING THAT AND THEREFORE MIGHT HAVE THE SORT OF SPILLOVER BENEFITS IN. AN AMBUSH AS EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. AND FINALLY -- ESTABLISHING A ROBUST SYSTEM TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF STATE CLIMATE POLICIES ITALKED A LOT ABOUT I DON'T. KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW SO FAR -- SOME EXAMPLES THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT REQUIRING DEPARTMENTS TO CONDUCT RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS AGAIN OF IT OF ITS MAJOR POLICIES -- FOR EXAMPLE IS COULD INCLUDE AS A PROGRAMS BEING ROLLED OUT TRYING TO PLAN. FOR HOW HOW THAT PROGRAM WILL BE EVALUATED -- OFTENTIMES IN OUR VIEW THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE. ON AND SO THE AND THAT MIGHT MEAN BRINGING AND RESEARCHERS EARLY ON AS THE PROGRAM'S BEING ROLLED OUT -- TWOS KIND OF SET UP A SYSTEM FOR YOU KNOW WHAT DATA MIGHT NEED TO BE COLLECTED -- OR TO THE VALUE WITH THE PROGRAM AFTER IT'S IMPLEMENTED A SO THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT GET INFORMATION ON ON WHAT THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM TO BAN -- AGAIN IT GETS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS TRYING AND TRYING TO SORT DEMONSTRATE WHICH POLICIES ARE AFFECTED OF AND AND THEREFORE CAN KIND OF INFLUENCE -- EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. SO I WILL END MY COMMENTS THERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. WELL THIS IS GREAT AND VERY. COMPREHENSIVE I I DO APPRECIATE EVERYTHING IT'S IN HERE AND THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SUCH A CONFERENCE PRESENTATION. AS IS THAT IT WILL LOSE I WANT TO GET EARLIER SO I COULD. SO GET ALL IN -- IN IN TIME SO LET'S OPEN THE FOR LET'S OPEN THE COMMITTEE -- THE FOR THE FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND THOUGHTS -- MR CENTER. YOU COMMENT ON OUR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS THAT -- ON COVERED. ENTITIES AND THE CAPTAIN TRIPLE THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT 80% OF THE ENTITIES THAT ARE COVERED THOSE ENTITIES AND WILDFIRES NO WE'VE GOT. TWELVE YEARS GOING FORWARD WE DO BEFORE WE GET TO TWENTY THIRTY IN SORT OF AN AUNT. IN ANTICIPATION AT THE MORE INTENSITY WHEN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE WITH THE CHARRED -- LUMBER SITTING THERE IF WE DON'T WE MOVE WE DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT CONTINUES TO ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS. CALCULATION WHICH WE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FRIEND PAT WE DIDN'T INCLUDE THAT. YEAH I MEAN AND JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND. YOU KNOW THE CHART ON FIGURE THREE WHICH KIND OF GIVES YOU A EMISSIONS THAT ARE COUNTED IN SORT OF THE OFFICIAL STATE INVENTORY. OF THOSE DON'T INCLUDE -- ANY SORT OF CHANGES AND CARBON RELATED TO FORESTRY FOR EXAMPLE -- I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S INCREASING WORK IN THAT AREA SORT OF TRYING TO ESTIMATE THOSE THE FACTS AND I THINK ONE CHALLENGES. TRYING TO SORT OF ESTIMATE THE SORT OF LONG TERM EFFECTS OF ENOUGH YOU KNOW CARBON BEING RELEASED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND THEN BEING SEQUESTERED AND AND TREES THAT MIGHT GROW SORT OF BEHIND THAT AND SO. YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT SORT OF THE LONG TERM -- CARBON IMPLICATIONS. IS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK YOU KNOW BOTTOM LINE IS -- SOME OF THE KIND OF OFFICIAL STATE INVENTORIES WE HAVE DON'T INCLUDE KIND OF THE NATION'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT IT'S CLEARLY A KIND OF AN IMPORTANT AREA -- AND I THINK THE STATUS -- IS IS CONTINUING TO TRY AND MONITOR AND TRY TO DO A BETTER JOB OF KIND OF COUNTY IN -- WHAT THOSE CHANGES ARE? JUMP TO PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR PRESENTATION WHAT CAN WHAT LESSONS CAN WE TEACH OTHER JURISDICTIONS ON REDUCING IS THIS AN AREA OF HOW WE MANAGE NO WE DO A LOT OF SUPPRESSION DO WE DO WE HAVE THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FORCE MANAGEMENT. FOR THE CONTROLLED BURNS TO WERE LIMITED GROWTH IN OUR AND OUR WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE MEAN THAT THESE AREAS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TO HELP MEET THAT. THAT THAT THAT -- CAM TO EFFECTIVE -- EMISSIONS BY -- TWENTY THIRTY I MEAN I I THINK THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES SORT OF ON THEIR OWN I GUESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH BAY KIND OF INFLUENCE ACTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS I GOT I AND I FRANKLY DON'T REALLY KNOW KIND OF YOU KNOW HOW HOW THE STATE CAN KIND OF TARGET. ITS ACTIVITIES -- TO TO DO ALL OF THE ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU TOUCH ON ARE IMPORTANT -- NOT JUST FROM SORT OF A GREENHOUSE GAS PERSPECTIVE BUT JUST A AN OVERALL KIND OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND FORCED HEALTH. PERSPECTIVE -- I THINK THIS QUESTIONS AROUND WELL HOW DO YOU. TARGET POLICIES -- IN A WAY THAT HAVE THAT KIND OF MAXIMUM IMPACT ON WHAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING IS JUST INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ONE AND IT'S FRANKLY I THINK DIFFICULT FOR US TO KIND OF COME UP WITH SORT OF AN ANALYTICAL ANALYTICAL ANSWER TO THAT BUT ANYTHING IT'S OF IT THROUGH THE LENS. OF ON YOUR TECHNOLOGIES OR JUST. TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS MIGHT BE. WILLING. TO ADOPT SO I THINK IN PARTICULAR SOMETHING THAT'S COST NO COST EFFECTIVE POLICIES A GREAT OUT WELL ON THE ON THAT METRIC YOU KNOW I THINK OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR COST EFFECTIVE POLICIES BUT AS FAR AS SORT OF TRYING. TO TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONES ARE GOING TO HAVE THE THE ISN'T THINKING ABOUT. SO FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE IN THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW THE OPTIONS IT IS AKTION SEASON FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM SO WE'RE GOING -- TO BE WATCHING THOSE NUMBERS -- THAT GO IN -- THIS YEAR MY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS THAT WE'RE STILL UNDER AB THIRTY TWO WHICH REQUIRES US TO SPEND EVERY PENNY UNDER THE LAW TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND WE HAVE. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT AND AND AB SIX SEVENTEEN ARE YOU KNOW SO MP ALLOW SOME WIGGLE ROOM HOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY SPEND THE MONEY BUT BUT URINALYSIS PREVIOUSLY IS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WE'RE STRICT GUIDELINES -- WE CAN USE SOME OF THE AUCTION MONEY THAT COMES. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE OPTIONS MY NUMBERS HAVE BEEN OF FOLLOWING IS ABOUT THE AUCTION PROCEEDS ARE COMING IN -- FOR THESE OUT. FIVE AUCTIONS IS THAT DRIVE WITH WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE COULD HAPPEN AT LEAST THIS FISCAL YEAR. E. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT I THINK SOMETHING IN THAT RANGE IS -- PROBABLY RIGHT I MEAN I THINK -- IT'S HARD TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT NUMBER OF FUTURE ALLOWANCES AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF THE POST TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWANCES HOW MANY OF THOSE WILL SELL IMMINENCE AND SOME PAST AUCTIONS THEY HAVE AN ALL SOLD SO IT. NOTED THAT THE NUMBERS COULD SWING A LITTLE BIT ON THAT BUT I THINK THAT GENERAL RANGE SEEMS RIGHT ONE OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS WHAT'S COULD BE THAT FLOOR. NUMBER AND WE YOUTH YOU HAVE A AND CAP SAYS THE CAP IS GOOD SENSE AND IN THE LEGISLATURE WE SET UP THE PROGRAM WE'VE GAVE THE AIRPORT COMPLETE CONTROL OVER IT. DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ON WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE COULD SET A FLOOR OR SET A CAP GIVEN. GIVEN WITHOUT TRIGGERING A PROP. TWENTY SIX POINT SIX IS A NEW DEAL BUT BUT IS THAT IS THAT A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT WE COULD ENCOURAGE. THE AIRPORT TO BY SETTING SETTING ARE CAPPED AND NO AND NO IT'S NOT PROHIBITED JUST SORT OF THINGS THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IF WE DO IT IN ORDER. TO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL NOT. AS A TAXI MECHANISM BUT SORT OF FOR FILLING THE STATUTORY DIRECTION THAT WE'VE GIVEN. YEAH I MEAN I THINK ON THE LEGAL QUESTION -- I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY WE I MEAN THAT'S PROBABLY A QUESTION BEST FOR COUNCILMAN ON AND BUY SOMETHING WHICH I DON'T THINK WE CAN A PINE ON A KIND OF WEATHER THOSE TYPES OF CHANGES WOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE OR NOT. I THINK FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT -- INSURING THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AWAY THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH ITS GOALS IN ITS PRIORITIES AND THAT MIGHT MEAN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL A MORE SPECIFIC DIRECTION AND WRITE IT DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO WE YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY THINK THOSE ARE ISSUES LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. AND ONE FINAL QUESTION MISTER CHAIR IS -- ONE MILLION METRIC TONS. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME GUIDANCE HERE ON AND WHEN WE GO THROUGH WE WOULD LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON HOW THE SPEND CAP AND TRADE MONEY -- AGAIN I WOULD I BELIEVE THAT WERE. WERE -- IT LOOKS LIKE WE TO GET THREE POINT TWO BILLION VERSUS TWO POINT FIVE BILLION BUT THE LONG THOUGH INMAY WHEN THE FINAL OPTION IS IS IS AND IT'S SO SO THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY. THE MAY REVISED FOR THE FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THE SENATE TO LOOK AT HOW WE WOULD BEST INVESTED SHOULD I BE USING OR SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE BE USING. THESE THESE -- A PERCENTAGE IS THAT YOU'VESET FORTH OF HOW MUCH 30% OF THE CUMULATIVE REDUCTION SHOULD BE COMING FROM CAP AND TRADE SHOULD SO SHOULD THAT WOULD BE THE INVESTMENT IN A SMALLER PERCENTAGE IN RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO BECAUSE IT'S ONLY. REPRESENTS 3% OF WHAT ARE SHORT TERM TARGETS ARE I I GET THE INVESTMENT IN AND OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUT IT ID SORT OF GUIDELINES ON WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD BE GOING. OR CAN YOU FLUSH IT OUT AND SEEING WHETHER MAY BE IT MAY BE WE MAKE IT BETTER SHORT TERM ACHIEVEMENTS BECAUSE WE CAN TALK ABOUT GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK. RIGHT -- AND I AGAIN WE'RE GOOD IT WE'VE GOT REQUEST THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID ON THIS LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS AND ALL THESE OTHER. VARIOUS PROGRAMS OF WHAT WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING THE INVESTMENT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS UNDERSTAND YEAH I MEAN I I WOULDN'T LOOK AT THE NUMBERS -- ON PAGE FIVE AS SORT OF GUIDELINES OF HOW TO THINK ABOUT SPENDING CAP AND TRADE REVENUE -- I THINK WE WOULD THINK ABOUT -- YOU KNOW WHERE YOU KNOW FIRST OFF WATER KIND OF LEGISLATORS PRIORITIES AND IF IF THE PRIORITY IS KIND OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WHERE ARE SORT OF GAPS -- EITHER IN CARBON PRICING OR JUST ANOTHER POLICIES THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE THE MONEY TO ENCOURAGE THE MOST -- PRODUCTIONS WITH THAT MONEY -- THAT COULD INCLUDE KIND OF YOU KNOW FOCUSING ON SOME OF THESE CATEGORIES -- BUT AT THAT SORT OF DEPENDS ON THE THANK -- YEAH BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE ALSO I THINK SORT OF OTHER GOALS THAT. IN SOME CASES LEGISLATURE HAS IDENTIFIED IN COPELAND REDUCTIONS ANOTHER THING SO YOU KNOW THAT WHILE THE GX SHE'S MIGHT HAVE TO BE BALANCED AGAINST SOME OF THOSE OTHER GOALS AS WELL. WITH THE LIMITATION OF HOW MUCH OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE OPTIONS ALLOW US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY VERSUS WHAT WE'RE BOUND BY LAW TO DO SIMPLE MEDICATION RIGHT SURE I CAN'T BREAK THE LAW. BY [inaudible] THANK YOU -- QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS I'VE FINISHED ON THANK YOU A SERVER. THE RATE PRESENTATION I THINK WITH ANY OF OUR PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF THINGS IMPORTANT -- TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE SUCCESS. OR LACK OF SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. WHY IS IT BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF? OUR CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAMS AS IT BECAUSE WE THE DATE IS TOO HARD TO COLLECT OR IS IT BECAUSE SIMPLY IS FAILING TO COLLECT IT. IN I I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH -- AT EIGHT I DO WANT TO BE UP FRONT THAT -- IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TRY TO SORT OF TEASE OUT AND SPECIFY THE EXACT AFFECTED FOR PARTICULAR POLICY AMONGST A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT EMISSIONS AND COSTS. IN OTHER WAYS -- WE DO THINK THAT -- WITH KIND OF A MORE VALUATION THERE'S PROBABLY OPPORTUNITIES TO JUST TO GET SOME BETTER INFORMATION MAYBE NOT ON EVERY SINGLE POLICY BUT ON SOME OF THEM -- AND MIGHT REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I THINK JUST LOOKING BACK AT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED -- THERE MAY BE SOME CHALLENGES THERE BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE IN THE STATE THAT -- CONTRITE A SORT OF TEASE OUT THE EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR POLICIES BUT ME ON SOME INSTANCES IT MIGHT BE LIMITED. I THINK ON A ON A GOING. GOING FORWARD BASIS TRYING TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE HAND AS POLICIES ARE BEING EITHER EXPANDED OR NEW POLICIES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED -- AND OUR VIEW TRYING TO THINK ABOUT -- BEFORE THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED HOW IS THE STATE GOING TO BE EVALUATING THOSE PROGRAMS AFTER THEIR IMPLEMENTED IS THERE SORT OF A PROCESS IN PLACE. FOR YOU HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT -- AND PLANNING -- THAT UP FRONT CAN BE VERY HELPFUL IN TRYING. TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW EITHER WHAT TYPE OF DATA MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN ORDER TO KIND OF VALUE WITH THE PROGRAM SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE LINE. OR IN SOME CASES IT MIGHT MEAN TRYING TO SET THE PROGRAM UP IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES EVALUATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW PILOTS BEING ED AND CERTAIN AREAS EARLY ON AND THEN. USING THAT AS SORT OF A A WAY TO EVALUATE IT BEFORE BEFORE IT GETS EXPANDED. APPRECIATE THAT -- I'M PAGE -- TEN YOU'RE LA -- ASSESSMENT A CAPTAIN A SICKLY -- OPINED THAT -- SOME OF THE BANK ALLOWANCES -- COULD AND ACCORDING TO YOUR PRODUCTION NOT ALLOW US TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS -- DO YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A NECESSITY AS A RESULT OF THAT. LACK OF ATTAINMENT TO MODIFY THE PROGRAM IN ANYWAY. I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT AND WHERE EMISSIONS WILL BE GOING GOING FORWARD I MEAN THE EXAMPLE THAT WE PERCENT ON THAT CHART IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THERE ARE OTHER. SCENARIOS THAT COULD BE DIFFERENT -- BUT WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO ASK CARP FOR EXAMPLE HOW THEY ENVISION CAP AND TRADE ENSURING THAT THE STATE NEEDS THAT GOAL VOCALIST THAT IS IN FACT SORT OF A PART OF THE REASON FOR HAVING CAP AND TRADE AS ENSURING THAT WILL BE THE TOOL TO KIND OF HELP. ACHIEVE THAT GOAL UNDER WHAT SCENARIOS MIGHT THAT NOT HAPPEN AND WATER SORT F THE CONTINGENCY PLANS OR WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS. FOR RESTRUCTURING THE PROGRAM OR JUST MODIFYING THE PROGRAM IN SOME WAYS TO PROVIDE GREATER CERTAINTY THAT IT CAN ACHIEVE THAT -- I MEAN IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT YOU KNOW MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING ALLOWANCE PRICES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE TRADE OFFS -- BUT IN OUR VIEW YOU KNOW SETTING UP THE PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL AMBITION OF THE STATE'S GOALS IS IMPORTANT. AND YOU HAVE OTHER TOOLS LIKE A PRICE CEILING FOR A CONCERNS AROUND -- YOU KNOW COSTS BECOMING TOO HIGH AND SO WE THINK THAT SORT OF THE TOOL THAT COULD BE USED TO CUT MEDICAID THAT BUT THE THE THE CAPS AND SORT THE PROGRAM STRUCTURE OF THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES BEING ISSUED SHOULD BE SAID IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE. GOALS IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT WE SHOULD BE LIMITING -- FINITE LEE THE AMOUNT OF ALLOWANCES THAT CAN BE PURCHASED -- I MEAN I HATE. I THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ADOPTING AB THREE NINETY AIDS. ESTABLISHED A HARD PRICE CEILING AND DIRECTED CARP TO ESTABLISH A HARD PRICE CEILING AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD REASONS TO DO THAT -- ULTIMATELY THERE'S GOING TO BE A SORT OF A TRADE OFF BETWEEN COSTS IN A MISSION CERTAINTY AND AT SOME POINT -- YOU KNOW MAYBE THE COST MIGHT JUST BE A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH IN YOUR AND THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE SOME OF THE EMISSIONS CERTAINTY AND SO. THAT INTO A PRICE CEILING. IT'S A LOT OF SENSE AND SIR TRYING TO BALANCE THOSE TRADE OFFS AND REALLY. I THINK THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO ISSUE KIND OF AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES AT THAT PRICE CEILING AND SO WE THINK THAT SORT OF DESIGN MECHANISM. MAKES MAKES SOME SENSE -- WHERE YOU KIND OF SET THAT PRICE CEILING IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION -- BUT THE THE OVERALL SORT OF DESIGN OF SINCE INTERVIEW. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY MORE QUESTIONS FROM -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I JUST HAD A QUICK WHEN I WAS CURIOUS ON PAGE BY PAGE TEN PAGE SKEWS GIVES A PAGE. THIRTEEN OF REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION POLICIES SEEM TO GENERALLY BE MORE COSTLY. IN CAP AND TRADE WHAT SORT OF AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS COULD WE USE TO SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON TRANSPORTATION. ARE YOU MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT N ON THE ARE. JOB CENTERS JOBS OPPORTUNITIES THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE MOST OF THEM BIG CONCERN IS FOCUSED NOW ON AND CERTAINLY WITH THE TRANSPORTATION POLICIES A LOT OF THE RESISTANCE. TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHETHER IT'S REAL OR NOT REAL HOW TO DO IT PEOPLE PUSHING BACK ON THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSPORTATION POLICIES THAT HAVE BECOME PART OF THE F.. SO HOW DO WE LOOK AT THAT GOING FORWARD. I'M I MEAN I THINK LIKE WITH ALL THESE ISSUES IS TRYING TO SORT OF STRIKE THAT RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN. THE STATE'S BUREAU CHIEF IN THOSE -- GOALS AND I'M TRYING TO DO THEM AND THE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY -- AND YOU KNOW IT I THINK IT REALLY JUST IT'S IT'S ON KIND OF A CASE BY CASE BASIS IT SORT OF DEPENDS ON WHAT'S POLICY YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT A LOT OF THE TRANSPORTATION RELATED POLICIES ALTHOUGH. MANY OF THEM FOCUS ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN PART TO ACHIEVE OTHER -- OTHER GOALS LIKE -- IMPROVEMENTS IN REGIONAL AND LOCAL AIR QUALITY AND SO -- YOU KNOW TRYING TO SORT OF VALUE WAIT THE PRINCIPALLY I MEAN GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND KIND OF COST PER TON IS AN IMPORTANT METRIC BUT THERE ARE OTHER. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL WILL YOU MAKE IT SOUND GENERALLY THEY'RE MORE COSTLY THAN CAP AND TRADE IT SEEMS TO ME WE NEED. MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON WHAT SPECIFIC. AREA FENCE REALLY WE NEED TO TARGET TO BRING SOME BALANCE. YEAH YEAH I'M I'M IN -- THE COUPLE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE LOOKED AT HAD JUST -- COSTS THAT WERE -- YOU KNOW AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN KIND OF THE CURRENT CAP AND TRADE ALLOWANCE PRICE -- AT NOT KIND OF FOR THE MARGINAL EMISSION REDUCTION OR THE KIND OF THE INCREMENTAL EMISSION REDUCTION -- MINUTE -- JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE I THINK YOU KNOW IN OUR VIEW. TRYING TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WAYS IN WHICH POLICY USE KIND OF WRAP AROUND OR OR A CHEAP THINGS THAT CARBON PRICING DOESN'T ACHIEVE THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND THERE. MAY BE SOME I KNOW AND THAT AND THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE AGAIN -- THERE'S A LOT OF POLICIES RE REFER AT THAT REVOLVED AROUND KIND OF PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS AS WELL AS PRODUCTIONS AND AND CO POLLUTANTS AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW THOSE PROGRAMS. CAN BE TARGETED TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS ABOUT THE CHIEF YOU KNOW EITHER A PROMOTE MET PROMOTING A PARTICULAR TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY OR ADVANCEMENT IN TECHNOLOGIES OR REDUCING COPELAND'S IS IMPORTANT. BUT THANK YOU IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MIGHT BE WHERE ARE YOU DO YOU REALLY. TAKE A LOOK. IS IT BETTER RECEIVED BY THE PUBLIC AND CERTAINLY THE COST OF LIVING ISSUES THAT. ARE FORMERLY CONNECTED TO MUCH OF THAT FROM THE THANK YOU REPRESENTATION MICROBIAL SPRAY LEARNED. WHAT WE'RE WHERE DO YOU JUST? WHEN YOU SEE THAT 38% NUMBER AND THE SCOPING [inaudible] PLAN [inaudible] DOES THAT. WHERE'S THAT SIT WITH YOU DOES THAT DOES THAT SEEM OUTLANDISH DOES IT SEEM DOABLE THE SEEM REASONABLE -- WHAT WERE YOU ON THAT NUMBER? IN I MEAN A I GUESS I HAVE A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ON IN -- ONE WE WE THINK RELYING ON CARBON PRICING AS SORT OF A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY -- I THINK THE OTHER THOUGHT IS -- AND THE KEY QUESTION IS WE ASK IS IS THE PROGRAM SET UP IN A WAY THAT WOULD KIND OF ACHIEVE THOSE. THOSE TYPES OF REDUCTIONS THAT SORT OF 38% AND SO -- YEAH RIGHT THAT'S WERE SORT OF QUESTIONS AROUND IS THE PROGRAM ARE SORT OF THE LEVEL OF THE CAPS OR JUST THE THE KIND GENERAL SET UP OF THE PROGRAM IS IT -- IN LINE WITH KIND OF THE THE THE TRUNK OF THE PILOT IS BINS WERE CARVED OUT FOR IT. IS IT YOUR SENSE THAT THE AIR BE HAS ENOUGH TOOLS. TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE AND AND AND AND KNOCK IT DOWN. ADEQUATELY IMMEDIATE GIVEN ALL THE POLITICAL PRESSURES THAT EXIST. BUT I THINK THAT -- THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE A WIDE VARIETY OF CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM INCLUDING CHANGES. THAT. MIGHT IT JUST FUTURE COPS OR MAYBE JUST SORT OF A SET OF RULES RELATED -- TO FUTURE CAPS IF IF THE BANK OF ALLOWANCES GETS TOO LARGE FOR EXAMPLE -- MS IT ALMOST A SIGNAL THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA GET MORE AGGRESSIVE IS THAT IS THAT THE MESSAGE IS BEING SENT BY THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S PROBABLY A QUESTION BUT I MEAN IT IS -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A TOUGH BALANCE AS WELL I MEAN YOU KNOW GIVEN THE AMBITION OF THE GOALS THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT CHANCE THAT YOUR PRICES IN ORDER TO KIND OF IF IF THESE TYPES OF JUDGMENTS ARE MADE. THAT PRICES COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY ANSWERS ARE TRYING TO MANAGE. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE HIGHER PRICES IS DEFINITELY A CONCERN AND SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE. THOUGHT THROUGH CAREFULLY -- BUT AGAIN WE DO THINK SORT OF YOUR FOLKS MISSIONS TARGETS BUT THEN RELYING ON SNOW PRICE CEILINGS AND AND SPEED BUMPS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT TO MANAGE. AND COSTS IS IS REALLY THE BEST WRITER SHE CRIME. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. NOW. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND AND VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT THE TURN [inaudible] GET. I OKAY WILL NEXT YEAR FROM TERRY NICHOLS WHO WILL -- COME UP AND TALK TO US ABOUT THE PATH. LEADING FORWARD WE WERE ALL EAGERLY ANTICIPATING HER REMARKS IN -- COURSE MISS NICHOLS IS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE SUPPORT. YOU MAY RECEIVE WHEN YOU'RE READY [inaudible] GOOD MORNING [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR INVITING ME THANK YOU FOR RUSSIA QUOTING ME -- THIS MORNING AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING -- IT WAS A REMINDER BUT ALL REALLY INSPIRATION AYE YEAH RIGHT IT WAS A GREAT -- HOPEFULLY -- SETTING OF THE STAGE FOR WHAT I HOPE IS GOING TO BE. OF A YEAR OF COLLABORATION AND THINKING OF WHICH IN WHICH WE CAN EXPAND UPON AND IMPROVE OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS. AND I THINK IT INDICATES AS YOU CAN TELL THAT I HAVE A PROPENSITY FOR THINKING OUT LOUD BUT WHEN I DO. IT'S IN THE DIRECTION OF TRYING TO CONSTANTLY BE ASKING THE QUESTION OF HOW WE CAN DO BETTER. AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE DOING THE SAME THING. AND SO -- I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES -- I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE LA -- I'M SURE WE WILL AGREE WITH SOME OF THEIR POINTS AND I KNOW WE DISAGREE WITH OTHERS BUT THE I THINK HE HAS LEFT OUT. ONE ELEMENT OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS THE REVENUE THAT HAS BEEN COMING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS FROM INTERNATIONAL VISITORS. AS WELL AS PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATES TRIPPING THROUGH CALIFORNIA TO LEARN WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW WE'RE DOING IT I'M BEING A LITTLE BIT FACETIOUS BUT OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP BUT THAT WAS REFERRED TO BY. SENATOR Y. CASKEY IS A VERY REAL IT'S ALSO THINGS THAT WE DON'T ENTIRELY KNOW HOW TO QUANTIFY BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT OTHER STATES OR OTHER SUBNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS -- PICK UP ON THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING WE ARE HELPING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND A MUCH BIGGER WAY THAN CALIFORNIA CAN DO A LOAN AND AT A TIME WHEN. AS WE ALL ARE AWARE OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME A LEADER IN THE ANTI TERRORIST OUT ANTI ACTION MOVEMENT ON BUT I BELIEVE WE ALL AGREE IS. THE SINGLE MOST PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM OF OUR TIME -- I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT IT'S WORTH -- CONTINUING TO REMEMBER SO -- I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN -- SINCE I REJOINED THE BOARD AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND WE DEVELOPED THE FIRST SCOPING PLAN UNDER AB. THIRTY TO THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TAKEN SENATE TARGET AND THIS IS VERY SIMPLE THE WAY THAT THE A. R. B. HAS APPROACHED ITS. TASK IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT AS WELL IS TO LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. SET A TARGET IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF TONS THAT NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE AIR. AND THEN DEVELOP A PLAN TO REMOVE THOSE TONS -- THIS IS NOT THE WAY EVERYBODY DOES THESE THINGS AND FOR EXAMPLE OF ONE COULD -- IMAGINE A THERE'S A CARBON PRICING PROGRAM THAT DID NOTHING BUT PUT A PRICE ON CARBON WITHOUT HAVING A TARGET AND YOU WOULD ACHIEVE SOME REDUCTIONS BY THAT. BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE CHEATING ENOUGH FOR TOO MANY -- AND YOU WOULDN'T BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE OTHER TYPES OF TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED -- WE HAVE HAD OUR PROGRAM -- EVALUATED AND HAVE TAKEN INPUT FROM. COMMITTEES AND BOARDS OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS GOING TO THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY THAT. IF YOUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE A SET NUMBER OF EMISSIONS THAT THE MIX OF BANDAIDS AND INCENTIVES AND PRICING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS USED. IS PROBABLY THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY YOU COULD HAVE GONE ABOUT ACHIEVING THAT GOAL. WHO SAID THAT WHO THAT WAS SAID BACK IN 200-010-2000 -- TWELVE WE HAD AN MRI AND ECONOMIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- WE'VE HAD -- PEOPLE LIKE. THAT NOW NOW MEMBER FOR THOSE CASO BOARD DOES SEVEN POINTS BEING AND OTHERS WHO'VE SERVED AS ADVISERS TO THE PROGRAM OVER THE YEARS. AND THEY REPEATEDLY LOOKED AT THESE I'LL BE HAPPY TO FURNISH YOU WITH SOME. QUOTES ARE CITATIONS ON THAT -- BUT I THINK WE ARE NOW AT A POINT WHERE WE CAN SEE THAT MOVING AHEAD TOWARDS OUR TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS. WE NEED TO GO FURTHER AND WE NEED A FASTER AND THAT'S TRUE FOR CALIFORNIA'S GOALS IT'S ALSO TRUE FOR THE WORLD'S GOALS THAT. ARE NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE AND NOW THE VERY SERIOUS THE FACTS OF THE WARMING THAT'S ALREADY TAKING PLACE AND WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN BAKED INTO THE SYSTEM. SO -- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ARRAY OF TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL AND WHETHER THERE WERE% USING ALL OF THEM AND WHETHER THERE'S OTHERS THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF AND WHETHER WE CAN TWEAK ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE THEM BETTER. CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO THE CAP AND TRADE AND BY THE WAY HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S AN AUCTION GOING ON EVEN AS WE SPEAK. OKAY ONE PERSON WHO FOLLOWS IT ON THE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD. QUARTERLY AUCTIONS AND FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROGRAM THAT HAVE RAISED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- IS WELL KNOWN BUT THE FACT THAT AN OPTION IS TAKING PLACE ON ANY GIVEN DAY OR WHAT THE RESULTS OF THAT AUCTION ARE. SELDOM PERCEIVED BY THE PUBLIC AND ACTUALLY WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING OUT WITH OKAY IF YOU KNOW BUT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT EVEN OKAY FOR ME TO ASK LIKE WHAT OF THE BIDS LOOKING LIKE WHAT WHAT'S COMING IN HOUSE IT GOING. THIS TAKES PLACE IN A COMPLETELY SEALED ATMOSPHERE -- WE DON'T CERTIFY THE RESULTS OF THE AUCTION UNTIL THERE'S AN OUTSIDE MONITORING COMMITTEE THAT SAYS THAT THE AUCTION WAS CONDUCTED IN A FAIR. WAY -- WE HAVE NEVER ELATION OR INSIDER TRADING OR OF THE THINGS THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT CREATING A MARKET AND ALLOWANCES WERE WHAT PEOPLE WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU KNOW MARKETS WEREN'T LOOKING THAT. GOOD BACK THEN AS A SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WORKING FAIRLY AND NOW WE FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE INDEED THIS MARKET HAS FUNCTIONED -- IN A CLEAN AND EFFECTIVE MANNER AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY -- I DON'T SPECULATE OF A LOUD ABOUT CHANGES WE MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT MAKING TO THE MARKET BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEND ANY SIGNALS -- IN ADVANCE OF A FORMAL RULEMAKING OPEN PROCEDURE FOR FEAR THAT -- THAT THAT MIGHT CAUSE A PROBLEM SO -- IN ADDITION TO THE MARKET OF COURSE -- WE ALSO HAVE AND THIS IS PERHAPS THE FUNDAMENTAL. BUILDING BLOCK OF THE ENTIRE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA IS THE HOUR OF VEHICLE PROGRAMS THE OUT THE LOW CARBON OR THE HELP LEVEL EMISSIONS AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROGRAMS AT THE STATE OPERATES. OUT WHICH ARE UNDER THREAT. AGAIN EVEN AS WE MEET HERE TODAY -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THEY INTEND TO PROCEED FULL STEAM AHEAD ON ROLLING BACK. THE OBAMA ERA A FEEL OF AND WE HEAR THIS IS NOT EXACTLY A SURPRISE BUT THE ONLY THING THAT'S A SURPRISE ABOUT IT IS THAT THEY'VE. APPARENTLY CHOSEN TO PUT OUT A BIG BLAST AT CALIFORNIA TODAY WHICH APPEARS TO BE PART OF A CONTINUING SERIES OF A VOLLEY IS THAT WE WILL BE SEEING -- COMING FROM WASHINGTON AND IT'S IT'S VERY SAD -- WE HAVE -- THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AT PROGRAM SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH DOESN'T OFTEN GET TALKED ABOUT BUT WHICH IS A REALLY FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCK OF OUR FUTURE AT HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE THINK ARE GOING TO IN THE LONG RUN. MAKE OUR STATE MORE RESILIENT AND ALSO. REDUCE EMISSIONS -- AS WELL AS OUR RENEWABLE AT PROGRAMS WHICH WE NOW KIND OF TAKE FOR GRANTED BUT WHICH HAVE INDEED. REDUCED EMISSIONS AND AND CERTAINLY MADE THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR BY FAR THE LEADER IN TERMS OF HAVING -- MOVE FORWARD ON ACHIEVING GREENHOUSE GAS. GOALS SO -- I I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE PROGRAM IS BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF DATA THAT WAS DEVELOPED LONG BEFORE AB THIRTY TWO EVEN PASSED THAT. THE STATE HAD BEGUN COLLECTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DATA FEEL USE DATA AND THAT WAS USED IN TURN AS PART OF THE MANDATORY REPORTING PIECE OF THE WHAT BECAME THE CAP AND TRADE RULE. AND WHICH HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN -- CONTESTED NOW IT ONLY COVERS THE MAJOR EMISSIONS SOURCES THAT -- ARE AT COVERED UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BUT THAT IS A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE SOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND WE THINK THAT -- THAT PLUS OF RIGOROUS ANALYSIS WHICH AS HAS BEEN SUBJECTED -- TO REVIEW AND AND IS. SOUGHT INPUT FROM MANY DIFFERENT -- TO IS A GOOD START BUT AGAIN -- WE WANT TO DO AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE TO DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS AT THE SAME TIME TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY. OF HUMMING ALONG -- WHENEVER I GET INVOLVED IN -- HEARING ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE POTENTIAL. FOR OVER ALLOCATION IN THE MARKET OR THE NEED -- TO USE PRICES MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN WE'RE DOING NOW -- I THINK ABOUT THE YELLOW. FAST IN PARIS AND I THINK ABOUT THE MANY TIMES IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ON THE VERGE OF HEARING THAT ENERGY PRICES IN CALIFORNIA WORD GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE. AWAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO HARM TO OUR ECONOMY -- THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THIS ARRAY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. IN A WAY THAT HAS BOTH KEPT US ON TRACK IN TERMS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. AND NOT DRIVEN ORDINARY PEOPLE TAKE TO THE STREETS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW WE'RE DEPRIVING THEM OF THE ABILITY TO GET TO WORK -- IF IT IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER ACHIEVE. THE LEVEL OF PERFECTION THAT -- MIGHT BE DESIRABLE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF ALL OUR POLICIES IS THAT WE LIVE IN A VERY COMPLICATED ECONOMY CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY COMPLEX ECONOMY AS WE IT REPEATEDLY I TOLD -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE LIVE IN A POLITICAL WORLD WHERE WE KNOW THAT -- THERE ULTIMATELY THE PUBLIC WILL ONLY SUPPORT BUT THEY THINK THEY CAN LIVE WITH AND WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY KEEP ASKING OURSELVES IF WE'RE MAKING THE PROGRESS THAT WE HOPE TO MAKE. RESPONDING TO THE DESIRE THAT WE HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC TO ADDRESS GLOBAL WARMING AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT DOING IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYBODY. TO TO GET TO WORK SOUTH. AT THE FOCUS LOW NOW INCREASINGLY HAS TO BE ON THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BECAUSE AS YOU HEARD IT ACCOUNTS. FOR NEARLY HALF OF THE EMISSIONS AS WELL AS BEING A LEADING CAUSE OF AIR POLLUTION AND A CONGESTION AND OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. THESE EMISSIONS FROM THE SECTOR ARE RISING DESPITE INCREASES IN FUEL EFFICIENCY AND VEHICLES AYE WHICH WILL CONTINUE DESPITE WHAT. MADE TURNED OUT TO BE A ROLE THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY IS ON TRACK TO CONTINUE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY CATEGORIES AND AND THEY HAVE TO IF THEY'RE GOING TO SURVIVE IN A IN A GLOBAL MARKET -- BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO START ADDRESSING SERIOUSLY -- HOW COMMUNITIES AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE PLANNED AND FUNDED AND BUILT? THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS HAS TO INCLUDE LOOKING AT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING. WE NEED REAL ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS LOCATED IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET TO WORK SCHOOL AND GO ABOUT THEIR LIVES WITHOUT SPENDING HOURS IN THEIR CARS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO REALISTICALTERNATIVES. WERE SLATED TO SPEND MORE THAN ONE TRILLION DOLLARS UNDER CURRENT SATE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PLANS. WE SHOULD BE MAKING INVESTMENTS THAT WILL INCREASE CLEAN MOBILITY OPTIONS CLEAN UP IN SUPPORT LOW AND ZERO EMISSIONS MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND GOODS. AND HELP BUILD COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TRULY SUSTAINABLE. AS INDICATED IN THE SP ONE FIFTY REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED LAST NOVEMBER. WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT A RANGE OF WAYS TO CUT SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLE TRAVEL INCLUDING BY PILOTING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO INCREASE MOBILITY OPTIONS ACROSS. DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNITIES AND WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO GET CALIFORNIANS INTO LOW AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. WE NEED TO BE PUSHING A RIDE CHER COMPANIES LIKE LIFT AND UBER TO TRANSITION THEIR FLEETS TOWARDS ZERO EMISSIONS. WE NEED TO B. CHARTING A PATH TO REACH THE GOVERNOR'S STATED GOAL OF ZERO DIESELS BY. TWENTY THIRTY SO THAT'S  LOT OF WORK -- IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD -- COLLECT AND AND ANALYZE ALL OF THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE IN THIS AREA AND TO BE COMMIT OURSELVES TO FINDING MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ACHIEVE RESULTS. IN ADDITION THE TRANSPORTATION THOUGH ACHIEVING OUR TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE TARGETS IS GONNA RQUIRE GREATER SUSTAINED ACTION ACROSS THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. WHILE THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR HAS MADE HUGE STRIDES WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STAY ON TRACK TOWARDS ARE 1100% RENEWABLE ENERGY GOAL. AND CONTINUE PUSHING AHEAD ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLEAN ENERGY STORAGE WE NEED TO BE DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES TO DE CARBONIZED OUR BUILDINGS. WE NEED TO BE A TURNING TO OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS LIKE FORESTS AND FARMS AND TURNING THEM INTO EMISSIONS THINKS. THAT WILL SUCK CARBON OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE. WE NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES THAT WILL BOTH CAUGHT FIRE RISKS AND UTILIZE BIOMASS RESOURCES FROM OUR FORESTS AND WORKING LANDS IN INNOVATIVE WAYS. LIKE LOW CARBON FUELS AND PRODUCTS THAT WILL PROVIDE A REAL AND LASTING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO KEEP SLASHING EMISSIONS OF THE MOST POTENT AND FAST ACTING SUPER POLLUTANTS LIKE METHANE BLACK CARBON. AND HYDROPHOBIC HYDROCHLORIC CARBONS AND WE HAVE TO KEEP INVESTING IN THE KINDS OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION THAT WILL SPAWN THE NEXT GENERATION OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED. TO DE CARBONIZED ALL OF THESE THINGS -- WE BELIEVE ARE WITHIN THE POSSIBILITY AND INDEED WILL BE INTERESTING AND I MEAN INTERESTING AND THE MOST HEY -- FOR US TO BE ENGAGED IN AND PEOPLE LOOK TO CALIFORNIA TO COME UP WITH INNOVATIVE IDEAS IN THESE IN THESE AREAS -- FINALLY OF COURSE WHAT WE DO HERE IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF GLOBAL EMISSIONS. BUT WE RECOGNIZE IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE GLOBAL ACTION NEEDED SO AS WE TURN UP THE DIAL HERE WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE. WORKING WITH PARTNERS IN OTHER STATES PROVINCES AND COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE MADE THE TREK TO GLAMOROUS PLACES LIKE KATOWICE AS WITH THIS TOO AS WELL AS TWO OTHER. POINTS AROUND THE GLOBE -- BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT I THINK THAT WE CONTINUE -- TO AT PAY ATTENTION TO HOW ARE PROGRAMS ARE BEING INTERPRETED AND TAKEN UP BY OTHER PEOPLE AND WE NEED. TO BE OUT REPORTING BACK TO YOU AND TO THE PUBLIC ON SOME OF THAT. COLLABORATING WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS REALLY CAN HELP US TO COST EFFECTIVELY SCALE LOW IN ZERO CARBON TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE CAN UTILIZE TO CUT EMISSIONS HERE AND THAT WILL HELP US TO TRANSITION. TO A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY SO. NO WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE -- AND THE ADMINISTRATION OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS AND CITIZENS UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHO HAVE COME FORWARD WITH SOLUTIONS AND PARTICIPATED. IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND WORKSHOPS AIMED AT PROMOTING -- LOWER CARBON LIFE IN CALFORNIA -- IT'S DELIVERED A RANGE OF BENEFITS BEYOND JUST THE REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- BUT AGAIN THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE SO -- WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH YOU AND WITH THAT I THINK I'LL JUST. ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE FOR ME. I HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU COULD ASK ME RIGHT HERE. WE WE WE GET A COPY THAT -- AS FEDERAL CASKEY. I WANT TO GO BACK AND REVISIT THE ORDINARY PEOPLE YELLOW FESS OUTRAGE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN I GOT ELECTED IN. TWENTY TEN THE PRICE OF GASOLINE IN CALIFORNIA WAS. THREE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS A GALLON. IT'S TO THE WE'VE DONE SB ONE THAT INCREASE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE WITHIN CAP AND TRADE THE SKY WAS GONNA FALL AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. ALL OVER THE OPINION THAT THAT IF WE HAD A ANOTHER CARBON TAX AND OIL SEVERANCE TAXES SOME. A SUCH THAT THE ORDINARY MARKETS SPREAD THAT PRICE AROUND IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THE UNITED STATES ITS MORNING THE CATION OF WHAT HAPPENS DESTRUCTIVELY IN VENEZUELA OR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. IF WITH THE WITH THE SAUDIS VERSES YOU KNOW OUR WELL MEANING PROGRAMS DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT. THE SKY IS FALLING AND AND THIS THE THE SORT RELATIVELY STABLE PRICE OF THE FUEL IN THE LAST DECADE WELL IT CERTAINLY IF YOU WERE LOOK -- ACROSS TEN YEARS THE PRICE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY STABLE IF YOU LOOK ON A WEEK TO WEEK OR MONTH TO MONTH BASIS IT GOES UP AND DOWN A LOT AND CALIFORNIA IS. KNOWN FOR HAVING EVEN SOMEWHAT MORE VOLATILE GASOLINE PRICES THAN OTHER PLACES DO BECAUSE WE HAVE SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE PLANS THAT ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA -- IN A IDEA I NO LONGER GO TO A GAS STATION I'M HAPPY TO SAY AS I WAS ABLE -- TO BUT MYSELF INTO A OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES NOT TOO LONG AGO BUT I DO HEAR A LOT FROM PEOPLE ABOUT THE PRICE OF GASOLINE AND I KNOW THAT. WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY SEES A SPIKE IN GASOLINE? PEOPLE REACT AND THERE'S DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE OR THERE'S SOME DISRUPTIVE WEATHER EVENT THAT CAUSES THE PRICES TO GO UP BY MORE THAN A PENNY OR TWO A GALLON. SOMETIMES EVEN AT THAT LEVEL YOU YOU HEAR A PUBLIC RESPONSE NOW IT LEVELS OFF GENERALLY AND IT HAS SO YOU KNOW AFTER WE'VE AB YELLED AFTER TAT MEDIA DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING AND AFTER YOU APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS. ANY TRUST VIOLATION OR OTHER OF MANIPULATION IN THE MARKET IT USUALLY TURNS OUT THAT -- PRICES YOU KNOW HAVE SETTLED BACK DOWN AGAIN AND NOTHING HORRIBLE HAS HAPPENED -- WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS A WHOLE CONVERSATION THAT -- AS YOU WELL KNOW -- THERE'S A STRONG. MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SEE -- OIL PRODUCTIONAND REFINING -- PHASED OUT OR BAND AND OUR STATE -- THERE'S ALSO PEOPLE WHO. FEEL THAT -- LIVING NEAR. TO A BURDEN ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFER OFTENTIMES FROM WORST AIR POLLUTION THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE SO IT BECOMES AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE AS WELL. FOR THE PAST YEARS -- I THINK WE'VE BEEN OPERATING UNDER A POLICY OF TRYING TO REDUCE DEMAND AS A WAY TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF OIL PRODUCTION AND OIL ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE COULD GET TO A POINT WHERE WE HAD ACHIEVED OUR ZERO EMISSION GOALS. AND THEY WOULD STILL BE AN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AND WE HAVE THE REFINING CAPACITY HERE. AND THEY WOULD SELL THE PRODUCT IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE ITSELF THE LEGITIMATE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY RIGHT -- IS SO IF WE ARE GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT THAT. WHOLE SECTOR IT DESERVES TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT IN A IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY I THINK THAT'S A LONG ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT -- YES THERE PROBABLY IS ROOM TO RAISE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE TO CONSUMERS BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE SOMETHING THAT'S DONE VERY THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY. GOT A I GUESS THE THE FOCUS WILL BE ON THIS MEDIUM TERM GOAL OF TRYING TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS AND AND WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBERS THAT YOU'VE RELEASED ABOUT THE INCREASED VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND POLLUTION GOING UP IN THIS SECTOR WIENER UNDERSTAND PEOPLE ARE WORK AND THEY'RE ALL ALL. THESE OTHER THINGS AND AT THE WHAT'S ANOTHER MARK THE SENT. I'M YOU INDICATED -- THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO HAVE THAT NEXUS BETWEEN TRANSPORTATION HOUSING AND I THINK WE'VE DONE THAT IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. PEOPLE CONTINUE TO FORGET THAT THE 35% OF THE MONEY GOES TO HOUSING OR TRANSIT OR RAIL CONNECTIONS AND OF THE 60% THAT'S DESIGNATED YOU KNOW IF IF THE WHITE HOUSE KEENLY THREE POINT. TWO OPTION NUMBER IS CORRECT THAT'S OVER A BILLION ONE THAT GOES TO HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION. GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE'S 40% DISCRETIONARY FUNDS IS THAT DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE IN THAT MEDIUM VERSUS THE OTHER WE'LL GET TO THE CLERK AT THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS ALL THE OTHER -- PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN IS FUNDING IN THE END OF THIS YEAR'S WELL -- IDEA I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PRESENTS A PRETTY CLEAR -- VIEW OF HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE FUNDS ALLOCATE THIS I'M NOT GONNA TRY. TO REDO THAT HERE -- BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT -- FROM CARBS PERSPECTIVE THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TURN OVER THE FLEETS. OF BOTH LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE THE TRANSPORT SECTOR OF A HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES OUT REMAINS VERY HIGH ON THE LIST OF SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE -- BECAUSE THOSE VEHICLES IN THE MARKET ARE GONNA BE USED ALL THE TIME OF WHETHER IT'S A LIFT OR pTAKING. GOODS FROM OUR PORTER THE AIRPORT AND DISTRIBUTING THEM TO PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY -- THESE VEHICLES US STAY ON THE ROAD FOR DECADES AND THEY ARE BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY LARGE SHARE OF OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AS WELL AS OUR AIR POLLUTION PROBLEMS SO -- I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY -- WE'VE SPENT TOO MUCH ON THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS IN FACT I THINK WE'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF CREATING A MIXOF OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FUNDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE. CONTINUING TO BE A TO APPEAR ON THE SCENE AND ALSO -- MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR FLAYED SEND AN INDIVIDUALS TO TO PURCHASE THESE CLEANER VEHICLES A HOUSING PROBLEM HOWEVER AND DEALING WITH CALIFORNIA'S -- CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF HOUSING CAP AND TRADE AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE OF BUT MY UNDER IT'S NOT THE ONLY -- SOURCE THAT OF PEOPLE CAT OR SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT NEXUS BETWEEN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND WE GETTING ON LET'S GO TO I HAD BEFORE GOING TO THE COP. TWENTY FOR IN A CUT OF PIZZA I WAS IN NORWAY AND I ACTUALLY WENT TO A WASTE GENERATION -- INCINERATION PLANT THAT WAS PUTTING ON A CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON CAPTURE MANDATE THERE NO WE CHANGED OUR BUILDING YOU KNOW IT'S THIS IS ONE OF THE UNTHINKABLE CERTAIN TALK BULLS AND CALIFORNIA TALKING ABOUT CONSIDERATION. BUT I ACTUALLY DID IT AT THAT CHAIRMAN ALLEN'S FIRST -- MEETING IN EQ. WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL CALIFORNIA THIS IS A ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WILL SAY GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGY AND GIVEN OUR DESIRE TO SHOW THE WORLD HOW WE CAN DO THAT WE JUST SIT AND LESS. LET OUR LANDFILLS ROCKED AND AND LET THINGS TO DISINTEGRATE AND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT EVEN WITH THE BEST RECYCLING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ALL THE MONEY ALL THE ALL THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM EMISSIONS THAT ARE TURN. OCCURRING AT OUR LANDFILLS RIGHT NOW AND IF THAT'S A IS APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT. AGAIN TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT ALSO. SO CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF CAPTURING THE METHANE FROM OUR LANDFILLS -- WE DON'T ALWAYS RE UTILIZE IT IN A WAY THAT SAYS -- PROGRESSIVE OR IS AB. AS CLEAN AS IT MIGHT BE AND WE DO NEED TO DEMONSTRATE OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH METHANE. I IN GENERAL BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF IT OUT MENTIONED EARLIER FROM NOT JUST THE LANDFILLS BUT FROM -- TREES AND OTHER VEGETATION THAT'S ARRIVING ON ON LAND AND SO FORTH AND PUTTING THAT TO WORK IN A IN A WAY THAT WILL GENERATE -- JOBS AND GENERATE PRODUCTS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY -- IN THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS PLAN THAT INCLUDES -- DERRY DIED JESTERS AND USING THE POTENTIAL FOR USING THE GAS THAT'S GENERATED FROM THOSE -- TO POWER AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT AS YOU KNOW JUST BEGINNING TO REALLY BE. INVESTIGATED AND AS I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS -- WE SEE THIS AS AN AREA. FOR RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS A LOT OF BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THE TECHNOLOGY FOR GETTING CARBON OUT OF THE AIR IS STILL PRETTY MUCH IN THE R. D. AND D. STAGE THERE ARE COMPETING IDEAS OUT THERE THEIR PRODUCTS THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE WORKING ON AND OUT WE SHOULD BE. TAKING IT NG DEMONSTRATION ON THESE ARE AT THE END OF IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WE HAVE NOT PAID AS MUCH ATTENTION TO BUT MANUFACTURING WHETHER IT'S CLASS PLANTS OR CEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE DEMONSTRATING A WAYS IN WHICH YOU COULD CAPTURE AND RE USE -- CARBON FOR BENEFICIAL PURPOSES THE IS A REALLY HOT AREA -- FOR ENTREPRENEURS AND AND INVENTORS RIGHT NOW AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HELP PROVIDE SOME. OF THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN TEST THESE THINGS OUT. IN AND ONE FINAL QUESTION ON OUR ACHIEVING THE SB THIRTY TWO GOALS WE'VE TALKED PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAVE TO PROVIDE A SMOOTH TRANSITION. YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO YOU KNOW NOT WITHSTANDING SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WHICH WITH THE SET. RAILS AND AND AND AND CAPS PUTTING PUTTING THAT ASIDE FOR A MINUTE. WE ALWAYS NEED TO READJUST. OUR NUMBERS GIVEN THE NEW IF RICE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH USED TO SAY NOW WHAT DO YOU DO WE LOOK AT THE THE IF WE SET A INCREASE A FLOOR EARLIER THAT -- RATHER THAN LATER WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THAT SEEMS TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO THE MARKET OF A SMOOTHER TRANSITION THE PAIN IS COMING BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SPREAD OUT OVER A DECADE VERSES. THE LAST YEAR'S WHAT IS YOUR THINKING ON THAT AS WE'VE GOTTEN THESE NEW NUMBERS HAVE COME IN AND STAFF THIS WONDERFUL JOB SAYING. NOT ALWAYS QUANTIFIABLE RIGHT MMHM. OF WELL IT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE ARE STUDYING AS PART OF PUTTING TOGETHER THE NEXT SCOPING PLAN -- WE HAVE NOT COME UP WITH ANY -- DEFINITIVE -- RESPONSE YET -- TO BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT SAYING THE PROGRAM IS PERFECT AS IT IS AND SHOULD CONTINUE THAT EVER HAVING ANY CHANGES MADE IT AND I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE LOOKING AT TO ANNUAL. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM'S OPERATION. NO MATTER WHAT -- IN TERMS OF MAKING AND ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS YOU KNOW X. AMOUNT OF THE REDUCTION SHOULD COME FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM VERSUS WHATEVER. IT IS OF YOU KNOW AT THE MOMENT -- IS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AS A POLICY. COULD BE DONE I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO LOOK AT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS MIX OF MEASURES AND INCENTIVES THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER TO TRY. TO KEEP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE -- TO A TO A PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO WITH MINIMUM COST AND MAXIMUM. SIDE BENEFITS I MEAN THAT'S WHAT ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN RIGHT BUT I DON'T THINK WE KNOW YET WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER AS TO ACHIEVING THAT PERFECT MIX THAT THE ALTERNATIVE IS JUST. IF WITH IF IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE HEARING IS TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THEN WE'RE STUCK WITH COMMAND CONTROL. THAN THAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE ALTERNATIVE A THEN YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE A ALTERNATIVE BE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DESTRUCTIVE. TO THE BUSINESSES AND SAYING YOU THOU SHALL DO THAT SO THAT'S YOUR CHARGE AS CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FOR THE PRESENTATION -- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR RECOGNITION THAT -- SPIKES AND GASOLINE PRICES CAN PROVOKE. A LOT OF ANGER AND I A REPRESENT A LOT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THE EASTERN. WHEN WE SEE THESE PRICE INCREASES PEOPLE GET TAKE OFF AND -- THE VOLUME OF EMAILS AND TELEPHONE CALLS TO OFFICE -- SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE -- YOU KNOW. IT WAS MENTIONED THAT -- IN A CALIFORNIA CAN'T DO IT ALONE YOU KNOW WE CAN CONTROL ABOUT 1% OF THE EMISSIONS CONTROLS OF OF THE GLOBE WE NEED WE NEED COOPERATION FROM FROM OTHER COUNTRIES -- BUT IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO OUR POLICIES THAT. THE COST OF FUEL ELECTRICITY AND HOUSING TRANSPORTATION CAN BE IMPACTED. STATE SENATOR -- ACOSTA USED -- ASSERTION THAT THE PRICE OF GASOLINE HASN'T -- INCREASED -- SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE AND MAYBE EVEN AT AND FACTOR INFLATION BUT WE DON'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS -- SUPPLY AND DEMAND -- WE ARE NOW A OIL EXPORTER MONAURAL IMPORTER AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF FRACKING NOT ONLY WITHIN CITY CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- PARTICULAR THE WESTERN STATES -- BUT WE HAVE SEEN -- PROBLEMS IN IN OTHER COUNTRIES ONTARIO CANADA WHICH I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE TOO A LITTLE BIT THAT -- THEY WITHDREW FROM THE CAPITATE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE THE NEGATIVE PUBLIC PRESSURE AND WE SEE AN AWESOME VIOLENT PROTESTS AND IN FRANCE. AS A RESULT OF HIGHER PRICES -- WHILE OUR CITIZENS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE AND MARCHED IN THE STREETS BECAUSE OF HIGH ENERGY. COSTS WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST ENERGY COSTS AND IN THE COUNTRY AND 53% OF THE CITIZENS IN A RECENT POLL JUST SAID THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING. LEAVING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING HERE IS. IS SO EXPENSIVE SO -- WHILE WE SET A GOOD EXAMPLE HERE AND UNDER UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP YOU YOU HAVE BEEN -- TAKING AB THIRTY TO SB. THIRTY TWO TO THE AT THE PROPER LEVELS AND WERE SAYING THE OPTIONS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL -- HOW DO WE COMBAT THESE OTHER? COUNTRIES AND SEE THESE HIGHER COSTS AND ARE TAKING A STEP BACK AS WE ATTEMPT. TO HARMONIZE THE THE WORLD -- THAT'S A BIG AND COMPLICATED QUESTION AND I'M. NOT GONNA TRY TO ANSWER FOR EVERY PLACE BUT ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT. I THINK YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT -- ENERGY MANDATE AND IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE AND AND AND THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT AS OUR STANDARDS OF LIVING CONTINUE TO RISE AROUND THE GLOBE. PEOPLE WANT WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY IN TERMS OF APPLIANCES AND AIR CONDITIONING AND IN THEIR MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD THAT. WON'T BE LIVEABLE -- WITHOUT SOME OF THESE BENEFITS -- CALIFORNIA CAN BE A NET EXPORTER OF SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT INCREASE EMISSIONS AND HOPEFULLY ALLOWS US TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO EXIST -- IN. LITIF SAFETY -- AS A PLAN AT AND SO THAT'S THE TASK I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT IT'S A IT'S A MORE. COMPLICATED IN SOME WAYS BUT IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT DIFFERENT PLACES A START FROM DIFFERENT STARTING POINTS AND THEY ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AS YOU GO ALONG THAT THERE ARE PLACES NOW WHERE -- FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW SOLAR ENERGY ISN'T BEING UTILIZED AT ALL BUT COULD BE USED IN A VERY COST EFFECTIVE WAY. AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT'S OUT THERE NOT EVERY PART OF THE GLOBE AT CAN OR SHOULD. DEVELOP IN THE WAY THAT WE DID STATE AND AS A COUNTRY WE WERE BLESSED WITH ALL THESE. RESERVES OF COAL AND OIL THAT OTHER PEOPLE JUST DON'T HALF AND SO OUT WE'RE KIND OF NOW GOING BACK AND RE INVENTING SOME OF THESE -- IDEAS AND AND WERE IN IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN BE HELPFUL TO OTHER PLACES AND NOT JUST OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF OUR HEART BUT OUT OF SELF INTEREST BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY WILL. BENEFIT IF OTHERS ARE ABLE TO USE SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL SO -- I I SEE THIS PROGRAM IS A AS POTENTIALLY. A WINNER FOR CALIFORNIA'S DESIRE TO ATTRACT THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST OF ENTREPRENEURS AND IT DOES CNTINUE ON THE PATH THAT WE'VE BEEN ON FOR ALL THESE YEARS OF EXPORTING OUR AT UNIVERSITY YOU KNOW TOP THE TOP -- EXPORTS IN THE IN THE WORLD AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT AS YOU SAY PUTTING TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE ALREADY ADAM. BUT THE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE AND I KNOW IN YOUR DISTRICT THEY DO -- NEED TO USE MORE ELECTRICITY FOR AIR CONDITIONING BECAUSE OF THE HOTTER SUMMERS AND THAT'S JUST CONTINUING TO GET WORSE -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE THE HOUSES MORE EFFICIENT TO MAKE THE AIR CONDITIONING ITSELF MORE EFFICIENT. AND YOU KNOW ALLOW FOR WAYS -- TO TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY THAT ARE DON'T USE AS MUCH RESOURCES AS WERE USING TODAY IF WE CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH I THINK ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE AND WHICH WE COULDN'T GET THE INVESTMENT NOT JUST FROM GOVERNMENT BUT FROM. THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO DO THEN I THINK WE HAVE. FOUND A WAY WE CAN FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS ACTUALLY A A NET WIN FOR THE ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND I I I COME FROM A A VERY -- GREEN COUNTY -- WE HAVE GEO THERMAL. JEFF WE HAVE WIND. WE HAVE SOLAR. I IN FACT -- OUR COUNTY SPEARHEADED THE EXPANSION OF PEACE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THE WE COULD BE GREEN SO THAT WE COULD LOWER ELECTRICITY RATES ESPECIALLY IN. THE PALM SPRINGS AREA WERE GUESTS TO BE A HUNDRED TWENTY TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE PEAK OF SUMMER. SO OUR EDITOR CITIZENS OF REALLY -- STEP UP TO THE PLATE -- THE SCOPING PLAN AND OTHER STATE POLICIES CALL FOR GREATER ELECTRIFICATION NEWS YOU MENTIONED BY EXAMPLE THAT YOU DRIVE AN ELECTRIC CAR NOW I'M. VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT I'M I'M I'M SORT OF A SOMEWHAT OF A GREEN REPUBLICAN I ACTUALLY OWN THREE ELECTRIC CARS. AND VERY PLEASE WITH -- THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE ESPECIALLY WITH. RANGING RANGE RANGE ANXIETY AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS NOW THAT ARE STEPPING UP AND CERTAINLY WE WE'VE SEEN A BIG -- SOLOMON FROM VOLKSWAGEN THIS GOING TO PROVIDE FOR MORE ELECTRICAL CHARGING STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE THERE IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A SUCCESSFUL. MARKETING OF THESE CARS SO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE RANGE ANXIETY THAT -- CONCERT MAYES SYSTEM AND I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO SOME MAJOR COMPANIES ABOUT THE TEST LET TRUCKS -- END OF THE RANGE THAT THEY GET AND THE ONLY CHALLENGE THEY HAVE NOW AS YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE PACE AT WHICH THEY CAN BE -- RECHARGE -- BUT WE KNOW THAT WITH THESE WITH THE BATTERIES -- THAT CALLS FOR CERTAIN MINERALS THAT ARE READY MIND AND OTHER PARTS OF THE OF THE WORLD EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A DRAMATIC -- AMOUNTS OF LITHIA AT THE SALTON SEA AREA THAT WE TRY TO MARKET -- TO TEST Là AND OTHERS BUT WE'RE BUT THESE -- LITHIUM ION BATTERIES -- IN GETTING THAT LET THEM IS BEEN LINKED TO SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. CHILDHOOD SLAVERY ESPECIALLY IN THE CONGO AREA -- AND HAS A A. R. BE CONSIDERED ITS POTENTIAL ROLAND EXACERBATIONS OF THIS. MORAL CRISIS -- IN ENSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING -- LITHIUM FROM -- ETHICAL SOURCES IF YOU WILL NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS QUESTION'S BEEN ASKED BUT WE WE'RE SAYING -- A LARGER SALE OF ELECTRIC CARS AND HYBRIDS -- THAT HAVE A CERTAIN LIFE. WHAT HAS BEEN FOUGHT IN A? FIVE IF IT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED I APOLOGIZE BUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH ALL THESE OLD BATTERIES -- IS THIS GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL -- DEBACLE FOR US IN HERE WE'RE TRYING. TO HAVE A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT BY EMBRACING THIS TECHNOLOGY BUT ARE WE CREATING A HAZARD. AT THE END OF LIFE OF THESE PRODUCTS. A SO I I THINK I HEARD TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ALL START WITH THE BATTERY ONE WHICH IS -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE ON BATTERY RECYCLING AND HOW TO EXTRACT THE MINERALS SUCH AS LITHIUM FROM -- USED BATTERIES THEIR VARIETY OF DIFFERENT -- IDEAS FOR THE BEST RIGHT NOW THERE ARE. YOU PEOPLE UTILIZING SOME OLD BATTERIES AS A STORAGE -- FOR ACCESS ELECTRICITY AND TIMES OF WHEN THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY BEING GENERATED AND THEN ALLOWING IT TO BE RELEASED WHEN THERE'S A NEED FOR THE ELECTRICITY SO THEY CAN YOU CAN TAKE A BASICALLY A WHOLE ARRAY OF THESE AUTOMOTIVE BATTERIES AND GROUP THEM TOGETHER AND USE THEM. AS A STATIONARY SOURCE FOR STORAGE AND AND GIVING BACK OF ELECTRICITY BUT THERE'S ALSO WORK BEING DONE ON EXTRACTION OF THE MINERALS AND REUSING THEM IN BATTERIES. AND AS ELECTRIC VEHICLES BEGIN TO BE MORE THAN THE RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF THE MARKET THAT THEY ARE NATIONALLY YOU'RE GONNA SEE MORE PLANTS THAT ARE. BEING CREATED TO DO THAT -- ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION -- WE HAVE NOT -- TAKEN ON A ROLE IN TERMS OF OF TRYING. TO POLICE LITHIUM IS BEING -- PRODUCED RIGHT NOW. BUT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS SOME PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING -- WE KNOW ARE BEING PROPOSED FOR FINDING MORE LITHIUM FINDING BETTER WAYS TO USE THE LITHIUM THAT WE HAVE HERE DOMESTICALLY SO I'M AWARE OF BOTH A MINING PROJECT IN NEVADA AND A PROJECT AT THE SALTON SEA TO TAKE LITHIUM OUT OF THE GEOTHERMAL STEAM WHICH IS. CURRENTLY BEING OUT PROMOTED BY. A COMPANY THAT DOES BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA -- WHICH LOOK PRETTY INTERESTING AND HAVE SOME VERY -- POTENTIALLY POSITIVE SPIN OFF SIDE EFFECTS -- IN TERMS OF OTHER -- RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THINGS THAT COULD BE ATTRACTED BY BY THOSE PROJECTS SO -- WERE. ENTHUSIASTICALLY FOLLOWING IT OTHER THAN THAT JUST TRYING TO BE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON THANK YOU. I LOVE THE FORMA MORE ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES TO THE END OF LIFE ISSUES AND AND AND THEN -- YEP SOME -- QUESTIONS FROM THE FROM THE MEMBERS. MR YES CENTER LASER. WHAT CHAIR NICHOLS IT'S THAT IT'S? IT'S SO WHY HISTORICAL TO HAVE YOU HERE HAVE AT THAT FOR A DESCRIPTIVE TERM YOU'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. THANK YOU I THINK. I'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT SO IT'S ALWAYS. THAT'S MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT -- THE WORK THAT YOU DO AS SO IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE INNER GLOW AND AS I SAID TO THIS HEARING -- IN HERE FROM -- SO MANY EXPERTS INCLUDING YOURSELF IT IS VERY COMPLEX. AND IT'S IT'S NOT AS EASY TO GET YOUR HANDS AROUND EVEN AS A POLICYMAKERS LAWMAKER. TERMS OF WHAT A THE RIGHT CHOICES TO MAKE AND WE TALK ABOUT BALANCING THE TALK ABOUT. DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE IN OUR PEOPLE AND THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCE AND HOW THESE THINGS OF THAT BUT AT AND I'VE OF HIS OF MINDFUL OF YOUR REFERENCE EARLIER ABOUT YOUR Q. AN AD THAT WAS BEEN PREPARED FOR YOU. SO I THINK ABOUT STANLEY AS I ASK YOU THIS QUESTION -- WHAT DO YOU THINK -- OF WHAT YOU THINK THE AT THE AVERAGE PERSON. UNDERSTANDS OUR KNOWS ABOUT THE SPACE IN WHICH YOU OCCUPY WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIGGEST MISUNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAVE -- IN THEIR LIFE -- THAT THAT YOU COULD CLEAR UP RIGHT HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT -- HERE THEY THEY HEAR ALL THE ALL THE NATIONAL IT. EXCHANGE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND INTERNATIONAL. I ISSUES IN COUNTRIES MET IN THE AND THEN THEIR OWN LIFE THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING. WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THEIR BIGGEST MISUNDERSTANDING OF YOUR WORK [inaudible] A OF THIS PROBABLY. IS NOT THE ANSWER THAT I WOULD GIVE IF I'D HAD A LOT MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT BUT BUT I WHAT I ACTUALLY THINK IS THE BIGGEST MISUNDERSTANDING. WITH THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE THAT WE HAVE IS THE FEAR THAT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THE PROBLEM. THE MORE I SEE OF THE NEWS CYCLE OF THE REPORTING WHICH NOW ALWAYS IDENTIFIES THE TIE BETWEEN GLOBAL WARMING AND THINGS LIKE SPECIES EXTINCTION AND FIRES AND FLOODING AND SO FORTH. THE MORE I FEEL THAT -- PEOPLE ARE FEELING. IT WE'VE GONE FROM DENIAL TO OVERWHELMED BY THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM AND HOW HARD IT IS TO ADDRESS. AND SO IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT I WOULD WANT TO DO IT WOULD BE TO TRY. TO FIND A WAY TO COMMUNICATE THAT ALTHOUGH. ADDRESSING IT IS A CHALLENGE AND WE WON'T. TOTALLY SUCCEED IN MAKING OUR CLIMATE BUT IT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY MORE CARBON OUT THERE THAN WE COULD GET RID OF THROUGH -- EVEN THROUGH A VERY AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM OF OF OF CARBON CAPTURE NEVER THE LESS THAT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS. THAT WE KNOW ABOUT INCLUDING JUST SIMPLE THINGS LIKE PLANTING TREES -- THAT CAN IF DONE CORRECTLY IN THE RIGHT WAY IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND YOU KNOW THE TREES ARE ALLOWED TO LIVE AND SO FORTH. CAN ACTUALLY -- MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN WHAT LIFE WILL BE LIKE -- FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS SO -- I IT'S HARD TO BE BOTH A PESSIMIST TALKING ABOUT THE GLOOM AND DOOM THAT WE'RE FACING FROM SEA LEVEL RISE AND ALL THESE OTHER TERRIBLE THINGS. AND TO BE AN OPTIMIST AT THE SAME TIME THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AND IF I COULD. YOU KNOW IMPLANT ONE FOUGHT AND PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES WHO REPRESENT -- VOTERS AND WHO TALKED TO PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE TO HELP US TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COMMUNICATE THAT. THANK YOU AND IN ONE ONE OTHER QUESTION YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S BEEN WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE COMMUNITY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THERE'S CONSTANT CHATTER ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CHOICES THAT ARE MADE IN THE SPACE AND WE OWNING UP TO THE COSTS AND BENEFITS AND RISKS AND ALL THE REST. AND HAVE WEEK AT GIVEN AUTHORITY AWAY TO AND NINE ACCOUNTABLE -- BODY -- THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE LIKE BUT IF THERE WAS WHILE ONE MISUNDERSTANDING YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE AS LEGISLATORS -- THAT YOU COULD CLEAR UP FOR A ONE AND SPEAK TO TODAY WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT MISUNDERSTANDING BE -- I HAVE. I HAVE HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE ALTHOUGH MAYBE NOT DIRECTLY THAT -- THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINKS THAT THERE RESOURCES BOARD IS -- NOT INTERESTED IN OR NOT RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN AND I SAY THAT YOU KNOW. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EVERYWHERE ANTICIPATING EVERYBODY'S QUESTIONS OR PROVIDING THEM EVERY ANSWER THAT THEY WANTED BUT WE SURE TRY -- TO SEE THIS AS SOMETHING WHERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE NOT JUST AS THE AT NOT JUST IN PROVIDING THE MONEY -- YOU KNOW HAVING US ON THE BACK ALTHOUGH THAT'S ALWAYS NICE IF THAT HAPPENS BUT MOSTLY IT'S ABOUT REALLY TRIED TO GET -- EVERYBODY ON BOARD WITH THE OVERALL APPROACH BECAUSE IT IS SO BIG AND COMPLICATED SO I DON'T EXPECT THERE TO BE UNANIMITY ABOUT ANYTHING BUT I THINK IF WE CAN USE. HEARING IS LIKE THE TO TO PROMOTE A SENSE THAT THIS IS A SHARED ACTIVITY. THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING -- YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THERE WAS CERTAINLY A SENSE THAT -- A ARBY'S PROGRAMS WERE ONLY FOCUSING ON THE A LEAD IN THAT WE WEREN'T -- THINKING ENOUGH ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF PEOPLE IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT WAS A SPATE OF LEGISLATION THAT WAS DESIGNED TO BOTH EXPAND THE BOARD. ODD TO PUT MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THE BOARD AND TO MAKE SURE THAT A PERCENTAGE OF ALL THE FUNDS OF THAT ARE ACCUMULATED FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WERE SPENT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND IT SEEMED AT FIRST LIKE THIS WAS A INTENDED TO BE A LOT OF IT OUT THAT IT WAS A SIGN THAT. THINGS HADN'T BEEN DONE WELL IN THE PAST LET'S. JUST LIKE WHEN TERM LIMITS WERE PASS THERE IS A SENSE OF NEGATIVITY ABOUT AT ALL -- AND MAYBE IN SOME RESPECTS THINGS GO TOO FAR -- BUT I FIND THAT THE INCREASED ATTENTION AND ABILITY TO GO INTO -- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND TO SHOW THAT THE PROGRAM IS HAVING AN IMPACT THAT MONIES HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY SPENT IN COMMUNITIES ON PROJECTS THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT. IS A TREMENDOUS ASSET HAND WHEN PEOPLE -- IT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN PARTICULAR ARE ASKING ABOUT THE PROGRAM I ALWAYS MAKE IT A POINT TO TELL THEM ABOUT THIS PIECE OF IT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT IN ADDITION TO DOING A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND COLLECTING ALL THIS MONEY THAT WE ACTUALLY SPENT THE MONEY ON THINGS THAT WERE THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED IT FOR AND THAT WERE BENEFICIAL -- TO TWO PEOPLE AND THAT PART OF IT SOMETIMES JUST GETS LOST IN THE DISCUSSIONS SO I HOPE TO DO MORE OF THAT. THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH US TODAY -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP OVER SO MANY DECADES I THINK. ONE OF PEOPLE ARE GRAND KIDS LOOK BACK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING AND HAVE DONE -- IN THE PAST THAT THE LOOK AT YOUR LEADERSHIP WITH A GREAT MARKET DISTINCTION. AND AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE CENTER I CAN'T HELP IT SECOND THOSE THOUGHTS. I HAVE A NUMBER  THINK SOMEONE ASKED ABOUT BUT I REALIZE WE ONLY HAVE BEEN LESSEN OUR NOW I'M LEFT TO GO AND TO UP TO ADDITIONAL PANELS AND IT ALSO YOU. IN A STRONGLY HINTED THAT -- THERE'S ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT YOU WANT TO STATE PUBLICLY GIVEN -- THE IMPACT THAT YOUR REMARKS SOMETIMES HAVE ON THE MARKET THE AUCTIONS -- SO I'M GOING. TO SAVE SOME OF THESE THINGS FOR A FOR A ONE ON ONE MEETING BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY GREAT DEAL IN -- AND YOU KNOW I GUESS MY THE I'VE I I I'M STILL NOT AND ENTIRELY SURE HOW HAD -- YOU KNOW. THE YOUR JUSTIFICATION BY THE IN THE SCOPING PLANNED THOUGH -- I I CAN I CAN SURMISE WHAT SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO IN IN -- I IMPLICATE TERMS A DECISIONS AT THE RP. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE. TO GET A SPELL THAT OUT TOO MUCH -- BUT BUT I KNOW THAT TECH THAT CONTINUES TO BE AN AREA OF CONCERN OUT THERE AND THEY'RE I MEAN THEY'RE EVEN SOME FOLKS WHO. CLAIM THAT THE IMPACT IS BEEN EVEN LESS THAN 5% ADD. SO HOW WE GO FROM THERE ABOUT THE OTHERS DEBATES ABOUT THAT BUT HOW WE GO FROM THERE ARE TO THIRTY EIGHT IS -- SO TOUGH. AS A TOUGH THING YOU WANTED. TOUCH ON THAT AT ALL OR OR I THINK IT IS A LONGER CONVERSATION I IT IT'S NOT THAT I AM NOT WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT I THINK I'D LIKE. TO WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS AND THE THE REASONS WHY LEAVE -- ALLOCATED THE PERCENTAGES OF REDUCTIONS IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE AND IF YOU WANTED TO ASK US QUESTIONS IN WRITING AND HAVE US FOLLOW UP THAT WAY WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE. HAPPY TO DO THAT OR COME BACK ANOTHER AND I THINK I I ASSUME YOU'VE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CONCERNS OF THE LA -- AS AS REYES ABOUT BANKING AND YES YEAH. OKAY I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION MISMAS I SHARE A LAST QUESTION I'M NOT A QUICK QUESTION I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ON THIS NICHOLS I THINK YOU STARTED WHEN I DID BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE IT WAS ON ONE OF THE COMMITTEES ON I THINK. YOU CAME. I INTO THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME SO -- GOOD JOB MANY MANY YEARS ARE I JUST LIKE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS MY COMMENT TO OUR CHAIR I THINK IT WOULD BE SO VERY IMPORTANT. TO HAVE THIS NICHOLS BACK FOR A MORE EXTENDED CONVERSATION REGARDING OUR THEIR APPROACH ON A ARE BE BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED SPECIFICALLY WITH THE TIMING OF ALL OF THIS FAITHFULLY ELEVEN YEARS AND WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET A NEW TARGET. AND THAT IS I THINK WHAT CREATES THE EXTREME ANXIETY IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE MORE OF THE SAME ISSUE SAID IT HAS TO BE MORE OF THE SAME AND ASK ME FASTER. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN MAJOR IMPACTS TO OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WE CANNOT DENY THAT ANY LONGER. THE REGRESSIVE PRICING -- THE THE PRICING POLICIES ARE SO REGRESSIVE THEY'RE REALLY HURTING AND LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. MY BROTHER IS LOW INCOME HIS ENERGY BILL WAS ALMOST OUR 35% OF HIS TOTAL INCOME THIS MONTH. BECAUSE HE NEEDED SUMMIT HEAT. SO THESE ARE REAL STORIES OF OF CALIFORNIANS WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IN TERMS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT SAVING THE PLANET ALL OF THAT. THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE -- A DEEPER DIVE THESE ARE DEVELOPED AND THE SPEED AT WHICH EACH AND EVERYONE OF ON THIS IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THEY THINK WE HEARD IN THE EARLY COMMENTS. THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER COST EFFECTIVE MODEL WE NEED TO DO A A DEEPER DIVE ON WHAT IS WORKING AND AND WHICH IS FASTEST. IN GETTING A FIRMWARE CLOSER SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THAT TODAY. THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THIS NICHOLS COME BACK SO WE CAN HAVE pMORE OF THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION. I DO BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO HAVE MORE ENGAGEMENT IF. OVERSIGHT ALSO ON THE POLICIES THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A RB THEN THAT EXPAND -- MAJOR OF THE DISCUSSION HERE WHEN OUR FUNNY Q. LAST YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO FILL THOSE ARE JUST THAT I I WANT YOU TO KNOW AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW YOU'VE GOT A HUGE JOB. AND YOU'VE MANAGED IT SO VERY WELL WITH YOU KNOW THINGS THAT GO UP AND DOWN IN THE FIVE CALLS. THAT FINAL COMMENT GAS IN MY DISTRICT IF NOT LESS THAN THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE. SENATOR Y. CROSSKEYS BUYING HIS BUT I'D LIKE TO SEND MY ENTIRE POPULATION OUT THERE THANK YOU. YEAH YEAH I LOOK I I MEAN RIGHT AND THEN FOR EVERYONE WHO SAYS RAISES THE VERY VALID CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OUR COLLEAGUES ABOUT -- ABOUT PRICE IMPACTS THERE'S ALSO FOLKS ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU SAY. WE'RE NOT MEETING OUR GOALS WE HAVE A LOT FOR THE TO GO AND AND THIS IS A REAL EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. AND CALIFORNIA HAS SUCH A UNIQUE ROLE THAT IT'S PLAYING HERE THAT AND SO THERE'S THERE THOSE WHO CRITICIZE YOU FOR NOT BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH -- SO. A DIFFICULT. WELL DIFFICULT I'M STILL HERE. AND I'LL BE BACK TO QUOTE MY FOR BUT YOU'LL BE BACK. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK -- WELL IN FACT TO PRESENT A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND AND I KNOW SOMEONE WHO. HAS RAISED HIS OWN CONCERNS ABOUT THE AIR BEES PA WE HAVE DOWN DANNY CALLING WORD WHOSE -- SENATE APPOINTEE FOR IT MAC AS I MENTIONED THE INDEENDENT MISSIONS MARKET ADVISER COUNCIL I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOU RECENT FATHER OF TWINS IS THIS RIGHT AT THREE WEEKS AREA OMEGA WELL WELL MAZEL TOV AS WE SAY -- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT AT LEAST. THREE MEMBERS THE TRIBE HERE ON THE ON THE ON THE ON THE PANEL TODAY BREAKING. THERE YOU GO. RIGHT AS WELL I'M I'M A I'M A DAD OF A FOUR MONTH OLD AND SO I AND I I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T LOCAL MORE TIRED -- YOU'RE NOT LOOKING HARD ENOUGH ALL RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT WITH WE WERE THE GLASSES I GUESS SO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND AND PRESENTING I I JUST WAS GONNA PATERNITY LEAVE BUT THAT IS IT SHOWS YOUR DEVOTION TO THE STATE THAT YOU'RE HERE. PRESENTED TO US SO. PLEASE PRETTY WELL THANK YOU IN THE THANKS REALLY GO TO MY PARTNER NINA AND MY MOTHER IN LAW MADE THIS POSSIBLE TODAY -- SO AND I THINK IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL TRYING KEEP THINGS RELATIVELY SHORT AND ENGAGE ANY QUESTIONS YOU'LL HAVE -- I PREPARED AS A SHORTHAND OUT FOR YOU ALL THINK THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO SAY. ABOUT THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW IS -- THE DEBATES AND DISCUSSIONS ALL HAD I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS OF MY ROLE AS A MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE OR THE I MAC. IS TO REVIEW THE DECISIONS AND DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ADVICE ABOUT THOSE -- DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT THE THE SCOPING PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED AND FINALIZED. IN LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AFTER THE A MUCH INCREASED ROLE FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS YOU DISCUSS NATIONAL THROATED DIFFERENT NUMBER YOU ALL BEEN CITING THE NUMBER FOR CUMULATIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND IT'S TRUE THAT. THE PLAN FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS RELIES ON THIS PROGRAM 438% OF THE MISSION REDUCTIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY A NUMBERS ACTUALLY BUT SO THAT HALF OF THE WORK THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO ACCORDING TO THE SCOPE AND PLAN IS EXPECTED TO COME FROM THE CAPITA RATE PROGRAM. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THE SCOPE IN PLAN WE'RE CAP AND TRADE IS PLAYED A MUCH SMALLER -- AND AN ARGUABLY LESS SIGNIFICANT ROLE. AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THE RESPECT OF THIS PLAN IS THAT THE CAPITA RATE REGULATIONS ADOPTED IN DECEMBER. ALMOST NO RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PLAN. JUST ALMOST NO RELATIONSHIP -- UP THE TESTIMONY I HAVE IN WRITING WILL WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE DETAILS ABOUT THIS THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE SCOPING PLAN ARE RADICALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO THEIR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE PROGRAM -- THE REGULATORY ANALYSIS DONE DOESN'T CONFRONT THE PLANE STATUTORY DIRECTION. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THERE BEING TOO MANY ALLOWANCES IN THE PROGRAM WHICH A DOCTOR BROWN TALKED ABOUT -- AND I WON'T EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL. FROM THE ANNOUNCES THAT SON ALSO MY OPINION RESTS ON A BASIC MATTER THAT OTHER LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES HAVE IDENTIFIED -- AND WHICH FRANKLY I THINK IS WELL BELOW THE STANDARDS WE NEED TO SET FOR OURSELVES IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND AGAIN WHEREVER PEOPLE WANT TO COME OUT ON THE QUESTION OF WHAT ROLE. OF CAP AND TRADE AND OTHER REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS BASIC FACTS NEED TO BE CLEAR -- AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SO FAR IN THIS PROCESS -- I WILL REFER YOU TO A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS THE I A MAC PUT% OUT ITS FIRST ANNUAL REPORT IN OCTOBER. AND TO ADDRESS THIS DEBATE OVER WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM'S PERFORMING WELL RECOMMENDED METRICS TO TRACK THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE ACCESS COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS IN THE PROGRAM -- SO FA A. R. B. HAS NOT ENGAGED OR ADOPTED ANY SUCH METRICS BUT THERE ARE METRICS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN FACT EVERY OTHER CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN THE WORLD HAS THESE KINDS OF METRICS SO IN SOME RESPECTS FOR LACKING THE OTHER LEADERS IN THE SPACE -- IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE KINDS OF METRICS AND MY TEAM AND THERE'S HEROES PRODUCED. ONE I'D REFER YOU TO PAGE FIVE OF MY HAND OUT THE MOST COMPLICATED LOOKING CHART. IT'S ACTUALLY VERY VERY SIMPLE STATEMENT. IF YOU TRACK THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES AND CARBON OFFSETS THE INSTRUMENTS THAT CAN BE USED FOR COMPLIANCE IN THE CAPITA RATE PROGRAM TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S IN PRIVATE ACCOUNTS WITH PEOPLE ACTUALLY PURCHASED AT AUCTION. CAN YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS THEY FACE YOU CAN TRACK THE EXCESS BUILDUP OF THESE ALLOWANCES AN OFFSET IN PRIVATE ACCOUNTS THIS IS NOT SPECULATIVE THIS IS LITERALLY WHAT ENTITIES ARE HOLDING ACCORDING TO AIR BEES REPORTING. AND THERE'S BEEN A DEBATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- AS DOCTOR BROWN ALLUDED TO EARLIER THIS MORNING I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE POST TWENTY TWENTY MARKET DESIGN PACKAGE -- IN DISMISSING THIS PROBLEM ENTIRELY IN TAKING NO ACTION TO CORRECT IT. OF THE BOARD PROJECTED THAT AS A WORST CASE SCENARIO NO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ALLOWANCES WILL BE IN PRIVATE HANDS IN EXCESS OF THEIR COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS AND SAVED INTO THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY NO MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION -- THE METRIC MY TEAM HAS DEVELOPED A VERY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT WE ARE IN EXCESS OF THAT. AS OF THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE PROJECTIONS FROM INDEPENDENT NON PARTISAN FINANCIALLY DISINTERESTED GROUPS -- CLOCKING UP QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN THE ARBY'S PROJECTIONS. SHOWED. A AND IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FOR NOW WE ARE ON TRACK FOR THOSE PROBLEMS TO MANIFESTED THE SKILL THAT CRITICS HAVE IDENTIFIED -- I WANNA POINT OF THIS PROBLEM IS LIKELY TO GET WORSE FOR SOME TIME. THE PROGRAM CAPS ARE HIGHER THAN EMISSIONS COVERED IN THE PROGRAM AND SO LONG AS THESE OPTIONS CONTINUE TO SELL ALL THE ALLOWANCE IS MADE AVAILABLE. THE EXCESS SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES WILL ACCUMULATE AND PRIVATE ACCOUNTS -- THE ONLY WAY THIS PROBLEM DOESN'T GET BETTER OR SORRY GETS BETTER OF ITS OWN ACCORD IS IF PEOPLE STOP BUYING ALLOWANCES AT AUCTION WHICH MEANS LOWER REVENUES AND DISRUPTION THE PROGRAM. I DON'T THINK ANYONE EXPECTS THE COLLAPSE LIKE WHAT WE SAW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OR TWENTY SEVENTEN BUT QUESTIONS AROUND THE OUTLOOK FOR TIGHTLY INTERTWINED WITH THIS IF. THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO MANIFEST WE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS MEETING OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL -- IF THE OPTIONS STOP SELLING OUT -- WE MIGHT SORT OF MITIGATE THAT TO SOME EXTENT BUT YOU HAVE THE REVENUE IMPLICATIONS I JUST DISCUSSED. SO I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ALMOST HALF OF THE PLANNED REDUCTIONS FOR THIS AGGRESSIVE TARGET COMING FROM A PROGRAM. AND NO ANALYTICAL CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE REGULATORY DESIGNED THAT PROGRAM AND THOSE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE ARE IN QUITE A DIFFICULT PERIOD -- I ALSO WANT TO RESPECT -- THE COMMENTS MADE BY SENATOR BATES AND SENATOR STONE ABOUT COST IMPACTS. THERE IS THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE ARE COST IMPACTS WHEN YOU PURSUE CLIMATE POLICIES. I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT A MARKET BASED PROGRAM LIKE A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS THAT AFFORDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS DIRECTLY AND ONE ISSUE WE CAN DISCUSS IF IT'S OF INTEREST. IS WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE SHOULD BE RECYCLING SOME OF THE REVENUE RAISED BY THIS PROGRAM TO DIRECTLY MEDICAID THE COST IMPACTS TO LOW INCOME AND OTHER FAMILIES -- RIGHT NOW WE ARE BASICALLY A SPENDING ORIENTED MODEL WHERE ALMOST ALL OF THE REVENUE. GETS SPENT ON DISCRETIONARY AND PRE APPROPRIATED FORMULAS -- BY THE LEGISLATURE -- IT IS TRUE THAT RAISING PRICES WILL HAVE COST IMPACTS AND THAT IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT LEGISLATORS AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. TO CONSIDER ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES IF YOU WANT TO DO MORE THAN IT'S DOING TODAY. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RELY ON THIS PROGRAM TO DO MORE THAN IT'S DOING TODAY WHICH IS NOT MUCH. OTHER STRATEGIES NEED TO BE ADOPTED TO STAND TRACK FOR THE SB THIRTY TO TARGET. AND THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS TO ECHO DR BROWN'S TESTIMONY I THINK A LOT OF THOSE STRATEGIES LOOK MUCH LESS COST EFFECTIVE THAN A WELL DESIGNED MARKET BASED PROGRAM. AND SO APPRECIATING THAT HIGHER EXPLICIT ENERGY COSTS CARRY POLITICAL COSTS THE KERRY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR CONSTITUENTS. pSMART DESIGNS THAT THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURE THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION WE'RE OFF TRACK FOR THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET IN MY OPINION. I AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN BALANCING THESE ISSUES BOTH AT A OR B. AND IN THE LEGISLATURE. I'LL STOP THERE [inaudible] YEAH -- ONCE AGAIN I I JUST CAN'T HOW I THIS IS ALL COMPLICATED STUFF AND YOU KNOW VIEW ALL HAMMY BIG DOCUMENTS LITERALLY AT THE HEARING. AND IT'S HARD FOR ME. TO TO SOAK IT ALL IN AND SO I JUST I PUT A LITTLE MESSAGE OUT TO THE UNIVERSE THAT THE THE THE SOONER EVERYONE GOT TO SIR MATERIALS -- THE MORE WE CAN ACTUALLY GRAPPLE WITH THEM IN PREPARE FOR THIS HEARING BUT DO APPRECIATE YOUR ALBEIT VERY DARK ASSESSMENT. OF THE OF THE FACTORS AT PLAY I GUESS THE QUESTION IS -- WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THE LEGISLATURE DO? TO PUSH -- AN YOU DO I MEAN YOU'RE COMMITTEE DOES SERVE AS A AS IN AS CAN OFFICIAL ADVISER TO THE AIR BE. ARE YOU MAKING A SERIES OF RECOMMENDS THE I MAC MAKING -- LOOK WHAT WHAT I GUESS THE DID COME OUT OF THIS REPORT THAT THE THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD SPEND THE INTERPLAY WITH THERE BE ARE THEY WHOA WHOA -- THAT I IDEA CLEARLY THERE'S THE THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS HOW HOW'S THAT COMING ALONG CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE. THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE OVERSIGHT REPORT -- AND THE RIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS THERE AND WE'RE NOT TAKEN UP IN ANY SERIOUS AND SUBSTANTIVE WAY IN THE REGULATORY PROCESS -- I WANT TO KNOW WHY WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE THE CONFLICT. I DON'T THINK I COULD SPEAK TO A ARBY'S PERSPECTIVE ON THAT I THINK THE CHALLENGES OF INCREASING THE AMBITION OF THIS PROGRAM ARE SIGNIFICANT AND OBVIOUS AND I SUSPECT THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT. I ALSO THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT THE BOARD IS FRANKLY NOT BEING AS TRANSPARENT ABOUT ITS STATE OR ACTIONS. AS IT NEEDS TO BE IN A CLEAR LOOK AT THOSE ACTIONS CONTRADICTS A LOT OF THE RATIONALES FOR DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE SO I THINK THAT'S IT. INHERENTLY A CONTROVERSIAL THING -- I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE BOARD IN ADOPTING THE CAPITA RATE REGULATIONS ALSO SAID THEY WOULD START -- AN pYEAR AND I HEARD CHAIR NICHOLS TESTIFIED THAT. SOMETHING LIKE ANNUAL PROGRAM UPDATES MIGHT BE A CONSIDERATION SO I'M HOPEFUL ACTUALLY THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR OF SERIOUS CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE. IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO START REPORTING THE DATA IN A IN A WAY THAT -- FACILITATES A CLEAR I DISCUSS BOTH AIR BE AND LEGISLATORS NEED TO MAKE ABOUT THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN AMBITION COST EFFECTIVENESS. A AND SUCCESS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE. MMHM WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE DO -- WHAT WHAT ARE YOU ASKING US TO DO ANY PARTICULAR -- I'LL ALSO TO STEP BACK FROM MY ROLE ON THE COMMITTEE WHERE I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY POSITION ABOUT THAT -- I WOULD SAY -- I THINK CONTINUING THIS DISCUSSION IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK THEIR SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. YOU COULD DIRECT THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO ANALYZE SOME OF THESE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. YOU COULD APPROPRIATE FUNDS ARE OR SUGGESTED THAT FUNDS NEED TO BE APPROPRIATED TO DO SOME OF THE MONITORING AND EVALUTION THE DOCTOR BROWN TALKED ABOUT. THINK THERE'S BASIC. INFRASTRUCTURE QUALITY OF INFORMATION ISSUES WHERE -- STATEMENTS FROM THIS COMMITTEE OR FROM THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE HELPFUL TO ADVANCING A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT. REALLY IDENTIFYING THE TRADE OFFS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO PURSUE -- BE HAPPY ALSO TO MEET TO TALK IN MORE DETAIL APPRECIATING THAT THIS IS A LOT OF INFORMATION TO ABSORB RATHER QUICKLY -- I'D PREFER TO SUBMIT MATERIALS EARLIER AND AND WILL ARE ALLEN MY FAMILY EXCUSE ONE SOURCE OF COURSE OF COURSE I I DON'T MEAN TO YEAH -- THERE'S NO ACTIVE IN PRODUCING SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THREE WEEKS INTO MY BABY'S LIFE AND YOU HAVE TWINS SO. THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER THING -- OKAY A QUESTION FROM THE FROM THE MEMBERS THOUGHTS OKAY I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU FURTHER AND HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY SO CALLED THIS AND I MEAN IT DOES SEEM. OBVIOUSLY THE CHAIR OF WAS A LITTLE BLEAK BUT SHE DOES SEEM -- TO GOING TO BE VERY HELPFULLY AWARE OF IN THE ALLOW ITS BANKING PROBLEM EMERGE THE CHALLENGES -- YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE THIS. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR LIKE ROLE THAT -- THEY'VE. BUT BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND THAT -- CENTER IF I MAY I I WELCOME THAT I THINK THAT'S A VERY. PRODUCTIVE STOP -- I LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATIVE ENGAGEMENT. I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT A WEEK AGO THE REGULATOR ISSUED ITS FINAL STATEMENT OF REASONS TO NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE DOCUMENT DESCRIBING WHY THEY WON'T TAKE ANY ACTION ON THESE ISSUES. AND I WOULD NOT USE ANY OF THE THE TERMS YOU JUST DESCRIBED -- IN IN TALKING ABOUT THAT DOCUMENT WHERE IT'S A FAIRLY COMBATIVE AND DISMISSIVE APPROACH. TO UP FAIRLY ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE FROM MULTIPLE DISINTERESTED PARTIES THAT HAS JUST BEEN SORT OF DISMISSED. AND WHAT WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE IN THERE IN THE DOCUMENT. I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST LEFT TO AIR BE TO THE OBJECTIONS OF THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF FOR EXAMPLE THIS QUESTION BUT OVER SUPPLIES BEEN TO SAY IT'S ALARMIST IT'S SPECULATIVE IT'S THE RADICAL. WILL NEVER COME TO PASS THE FIGURE YOU SAW LA -- IN AND THE ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE HAND OUT IS JUST AN IDEA AND WE JUST ON OUT FOR WEBER HAPPEN -- INTO THAT I WOULD SHOW YOU FIGURE THREE AND AND MY HAND AT WORK AND YOU CAN NOW MEASURE IN A OR B. SOME DATA THAT THE PROBLEMS MANIFESTED TO A GREATER DEGREE. THAN THE WORST CASE ASSUMPTION FOR TWENTY TWENTY AS A TWENTY EIGHTEEN I THINK AGAIN WHEN ONE LOOKS CLEARLY AT THE DATA WITHOUT EXPRESSING JUDGMENTS ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS DATA -- OF A VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION BEGINS I HOPE. THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WILL WILL NOW UNFOLD. AS WE HOPEFULLY MOVE TO A POINT WITH KNOWLEDGE THE CURRENT MARKET IS NOT THE MARKET THAT'S NEEDED. TO ACHIEVE WITH IDENTIFIED IN THE SCOPE AND PLAN. OUT WHERE ONE GOES FROM THERE -- THERE ARE IMPORTANT TRADE OFFS TO MAKE BUT TO START WITH CLEAR DATA I THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING -- OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER KHAN WORD AND FOR TO THE FUTURE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO A VERY SHE PANEL WE HAVE PAUL JACOBS WHO'S WITH THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH WE HAVE ROBBIE PRESSURE. OUR TWO TWO FOLKS FROM FROM DIFFERENT A YOU SEE LABS. AND STEVE GLAZER IS A BIG FAN OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WE'VE GOT -- AND THE LABS THAT IT WAS ONE OF WHICH OR IS IN YOUR DISTRICTS OFFERS A LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB. WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY ROBBIE PRESSURE HERE -- I FROM LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LAB THAT IS INDEED IN YOUR DISTRICT AND HAS SOME INNOVATIVE AND INTERESTING THINGS TO TALK ABOUT -- AS WELL SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO -- LET'S START WITH YOU MISTER JACOBS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PARTICLES FROM THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND I'M GONNA BE GOING OVER A HANDOUT THAT I BELIEVE YOU GUYS HAVE IN YOUR ON MEMBERS PACKAGE. TELL SUPPORTING CLEAN TECHNOLOGY BREAKTHROUGHS -- I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO REACH OUR SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AND ALSO TO HAVE AN IMPACT. OF IN INFLUENCING OTHER JURISDICTIONS -- TO ADD TO IMPROVE THE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS READ ANY TECHNOLOGY BREAKTHROUGHS AND BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WORK REPORT BE PRESENTING AS DERIVE FROM REPORTS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MEMBERS YOUR COMMITTEE OF CENTER Y. CASKEY AND CENTER STERN. IF YOU'LL TURN TO PAGE. ONE REFERS ALL PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE CLEAN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE. THAT YOU TALK TO PRACTITIONERS FOR WORKING AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL SORTS OF TERMINOLOGY BEING REFERRED TO IN DIFFERENT STAGES. ARE VERY TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE TECHNICAL READYLIFT READYLIFT LEVEL NUMBER. FIVE OR YOU'RE VERY VAGUE TERMS LIKE -- COMMERCIALS EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND WE TRY TO CATEGORIZE THE DEVELOPMENT INTO SOME EASILY AND CALL AND AND CLEAR UNDERSTANDABLE -- CATEGORIES HERE STARTING WITH FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH. MOVING INTO APPLIED RESEARCH THAT MOVES INTO A DEVELOPING A PROTOTYPE THAT NEEDS TO BE THEM DENT DEMONSTRATE IN REAL WORLD CONDITIONS. AND THEN THE CURTAIN COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENT FINALLY AND WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED AN EXAMPLE OF A WELL KNOWN TECHNOLOGIST BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR -- SOLAR PANEL YOU CAN SEE A SNAPSHOT OF HOW THAT TECHNOLOGY LOOKS IN EACH STAGE I HOPE IS PROVIDE KIND OF A A BIG PICTURE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF HOW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPS. ALONG A VERY EXTENSIVE AND SOMETIMES LONG PIPELINE -- WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY BRAKE THERE IS IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT THE EARLIER YOU ARE IN THE PIPELINE THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY BREAK THROUGH THIS REALLY TO CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CURRENTLY SEE TODAY? IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TO THE HAND OUT WE DISCUSS SOME CHALLENGES THAT -- PARTICULARLY CLEAN TECHNOLOGY FACES AS IT MOVES THIS PIPELINE. THE FIRST AT A CHALLENGE THEIR FINANCIAL SO COMPARED TO SOFTWARE OR PHARMACEUTICAL INVESTMENTS CLEAN TECHNOLOGY IS CONSIDERED A VERY HIGH RISK INVESTMENT. THAT'S PARTLY DUE TO THE LONG TIME LINE IT TAKES TO REALIZE REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS FROM CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. AND ALSO THE HIGH CAPITAL COST REQUIRED UP FRONT PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT'S USUALLY A LOT LARGER MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN LIKE A SOFTWARE PHARMACEUTICALS. THERE'S OTHER POLICY STATE POLICIES THAT MIGHT PRESENT CHALLENGES TO MOVING TECHNOLOGY TO THE PIPELINE THESE MIGHT BE DUE TO INCONSISTENT IN LOCAL PROPERTY POLICIES. OR INCONSISTENT RESEARCH CONTRACTING PROCEDURES THAT WOULD INHIBIT SUMMER BEST RESEARCHERS FROM EXPLORING IN DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY -- WITH CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES ACTUALLY NON FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCIENTISTS WORKING IN THE HARD SCIENCES HE PHYSICISTS. YOU TALK ABOUT ON MATERIAL SCIENTISTS HAVE THE SKILL SET TO TRANSITION INTO THE ENTREPRENEURIAL OR BUSINESS SPACE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO FACILITIES. TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE OR TO MANUFACTURE YOUR SMALL DEMONSTRATION PROJECT SO THOSE ARE NON FINANCIAL KIND OF BARRIERS THAT CLEAN TECHNOLOGY FACES AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE PIPELINE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. THREE FOR PART OF OUR WORK WE REVIEWED WE'VE RECENTLY REVIEWED FORTY STATE PROGRAMS. THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY OR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION -- FROM THOSE FORTY PROGRAMS WE HAVE ESTIMATED THE CURRENT YEAR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING LEVELS. IN WHERE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUPPORTING THE PIPELINE IN EACH CATEGORY OF THE PIPING THAT WE HAVE DESIGNATED -- IT SHOULD BE NOTED HERE THAT ALTHOUGH THE STATE DOES NOT REPRESENT DOES NOT -- SUPPORT FROM MILLER RESEARCH THAT FUNDING IS USUALLY TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THREE UNIVERSITY. AND FINALLY IT FREED ME FROM WITH PASSING OF SOME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WHEN TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE TIME HERE. FINALLY ON THE LAST PAGE PAGE FOR WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF KEY ISSUES FOR THE COMMUNITY CONSIDER. THE FIRST THE FIRST ISSUE LOOKING BACK AT THAT -- TABLE ON PAGE THREE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE STATE INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE LEFT THE LAST STAGE OF OF THAT -- DEPLOYMENT WHICH IS A COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENT. EXPERTS TYPICALLY RECOMMEND THAT IF PARTICULARLY FOR TRYING TO FOSTER TECHNOLOGY BREAKTHROUGHS YOU ONE HAVE A BALANCED PORTFOLIO APPROACH. AND AND KIND OF OPTIMIZE WERE YOUR INVESTMENT STRATEGICALLY ARE ARE BEING PLACED -- REFERRING BACK TO THE LA -- DOCTOR TALKING ABOUT MARKET FAILURES FOR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY A LARGE DROP OFF OF FUNDING FROM THE APPLIED RESEARCH THE PROTOTYPE PHASE. THAT'S WERE FEDERAL FUNDS DROP OFF AND WE CURRENTLY SEE IN THE TABLE DON'T REALLY SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN SUPPORTING THE PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT'S CONSIDERED A WOULD BE CONSIDERED A A MARKET FAILURE IN IN THE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. ALSO REVIEWING OUR THE PROGRAM TO FIND IF THERE IS LIKELY PROGRAM OVERLAP SPECIFICALLY ON THE PROGRAMS ARE TARGETING ENERGY EFFICIENCY. HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THOSE A TARGET LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. AND PROGRAM OVERLAP CAN PRODUCE INEFFICIENCIES INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE INTENDED TO SUPPORT THIS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. WE ALSO FIND THOSE INCONSISTENCIES ACROSS STATE AGENCIES AND HOW THEY HANDLE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICIES. AND THE RESEARCH CONTRACTING PROCEDURES PARTICULARLY OF IP POLICY THERE IS NO STATEWIDE I POLICY RIGHT NOW SO EVERY -- AGENCY THAT THAT'S THE MINISTRY'S HAD A KIND OF GRANTS ARE BASICALLY REINVENTING THE WHEEL EVERY SINGLE TIME. AND THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE THAT SHOWN THAT I'M CLEAR IP POLICIES AND RULES REQUIREMENTS OF LIKELY LEAD TO THE DISCOURAGED MEANT. A VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT THAT'S SO CRITICAL IN THAT PROTOTYPE PHASE -- IN OUR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. AND SUMMARIZES MY PRECISION THANK YOU. AND IT AND WHO WOULD I'M. WHO WOULD WHO WOULD PROMULGATE THAT THE STATE AGENCY ID POLICIES ACT THAT'S ON IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE COULD DO? THAT'S SOMETHING TO LIKE SUCH A GOOD DEAL AS AN ADVISER YES YES OKAY. INTERESTING BILL IDEA OKAY. SO WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR HIM. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR NEXT WAY FOR MR PRESSURE DR PRESSURE. AWESOME SO SHERMAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY BEFORE. THE CALIFORNIA SENATE ENVIRONMENT. QUALITY COMMITTEE TODAY. ALL THIS I'M VERY HONORED TO DISCUSS STATES UP A CLIMATE JINGLES RESOURCE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY NEEDS -- IN CONNECTION WITH MEETING THE SB THIRTY TWO REQUIREMENTSOF THAT CALIFORNIA DEDUCE ITS OVERALL EMOTIONAL 40% BELOW THE NINETEEN NINETY LEVEL UP. SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT YOU NEED TO GET THEIR OF OF WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE KEY BARRIERS AND HE SAYS NEEDS. UP BEFORE I AGREE AYE AYE TALK ABOUT THOSE NEEDS EYES ONE THE TANKS WAS TO FALL A FEW FOR SUPPORTING THE DIESELS OF BERKELEY LAP. FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. WE HAVE BEEN A PARTNER OF BIGELOW STREET OF CALIFORNIA SINCE ITS FOUNDING [inaudible] AND UP. ART ROSENFELD ROOM SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW. WAS BURKE LAB SCIENTIST. OF WHAT IS CALLED AN ACTIVIST AND A PUBLIC SERVANT. ACROSS FROM THE FULL OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY. UP CALIFORNIA LONGSTANDING LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY POLICY AND SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY SEARCH. HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO SOMETHING CALLED A DOZEN FROZEN FOR EFFECT. THE FACT THAT PARK UP ELECTRICITY USE IN CALIFORNIA HAS NOT INCREASED FOR DECADES. WHAT IT DOES INCLUDE A 50% REST OF THE COUNTRY? UP IS IS STARTING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THE COMPANIES OF OF A NINETEEN SEVENTIES A PRODUCTIVE USE OF WHAT IF I LIKE TO CITY ELECTRICITY I GUESS. UP UP AND THAT IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE RULES IN FULL EFFECT ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY -- IMPROVEMENT IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY UP. TODAY I LEAVE THE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AREA AT BERKELEY LAB. THIS PARTICULAR AT SUCH AREA OF THE LAB IS COMPRISED OF MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED RESEARCHERS AND STOP. WHO SPEND THEIR PROFESSIONAL LIVES PURSUING THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TODAY? I IN ADDITION TO OUR PRIMARY WILL PRODUCE FUNDED BY. PRIMARILY BY THE BOTTOM ENERGY MUCH OF THIS RESEARCH IS ALSO. COMPUTER THE SUPPORT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MOST IMPACTFUL LEAVE BEFORE NAY FROM CALIFORNIA IS A COMMISSION. EPIC PROGRAM WHICH IS FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE PIPP PROGRAM. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO TIE OUTGOING CHAIRMAN VISOR MILLER. AND AND THE INCOMING TEACHERS ON MEN HAWK SHIELD. FOR THE TIRELESS WORK UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA ADVANCED TO SUPPORT RESEARCH THAT DEMONSTRATES SOLUTION TO THOSE. CHALLENGES JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE. WELL THE AP PROJECTS FUNDED IN YOUR DISTRICT. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THAT THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL THE TO CANNOT CONNECT ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OFF OF THE ONE DOLLAR INVESTED IN RESEARCH. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO ALMOST HUNDRED DOLLARS SAVINGS. AND THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT. FUNDING RESEARCH BEES OFF. NOT ORDER THANK GOD -- CAUGHT YOUR MILLION NICHOLS FOR BECAUSE SCOTT WAS A SUPPORTS QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH AT THE LAB INTENSE AND DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT AND MOMENT ANALYSIS. NOT GOING BACK TO THE TOPIC OF THE DAY AT WATER DONE HE SAYS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY NEEDS AND WELL THE GAPS IN DUMPS A MEETING THERE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS. FIRST OF ALL YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALREADY MADE A TWENTY TWENTY TARGET WHICH IS VERY COMMENDABLE VERY COMMENDABLE FEAT. NOW THE QUESTION IS FROM HERE TO TWENTY THIRTY WHAT ELSE WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT NEEDED. SO FOR ACHIEVING THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOALS WE WILL NEED A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DATE DE CARBONIZED TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. OF THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND THE BUILDING SECTOR BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TOP THREE GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTERS IN THE STATE. BUILDING HEATING IS PRIMARILY BASED ON NATURAL GAS AND I THINK I BELIEVE I HEARD SOME DISCUSSION RELATED TO THAT EARLIER TODAY YEAH. AND SO ELECTRIFICATION A BUILDING HEATING VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN ACHIEVING FUTURE. DAMAGING GOALS OF CALIFORNIA. IT ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF NON CARBON DIOXIDE REYES GOT A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. A PARTICULARLY FROM THE CRITICAL JUST SECTOR AND REFRIGERATION. OR DO YOU TO PLEASE TO US SOMEONE HE'D RAVES ARE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENT FOR AIR CONDITIONING IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND AND THE REFRIGERANT THAT WE USE TODAY HAVE A VERY HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AS COMPARED TO COVERED EXCITE. THAT'S AND I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO DATE BE A LOT OF ATTENTION TO UP. SWITCHING TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO RENEWABLE RESOURCES IS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL THE DATA INDICATE THAT THAT IN FACT A THE THE THE FUEL USE AND TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN IN CALIFORNIA'S INCREASING. AND AND AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE THESE TARGETS THE SWITCH TO RENEWABLE. ENERGY SOURCES FOR TRANSPORTATION. ALSO I END UP TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE OBVIOUS JUNIPER BEFORE YOUR GOALS. AND IN OUR OPINION THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE DOCTOR PROBLEM VERY BECOME WHAT'S MORE PENETRATION OF INTERVAL. SO WE HAVE TO FOLLOW TECHNOLOGIES AND STRATEGIES TO SOLVE THE DARKER PROBLEM I'D UP. CLOSE THE CONVERSION EXTENT STORAGE BASICALLY I'LL TALK ABOUT THE DENTIST COMBINATION OF STORIES AS WELL AS HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE NOTES IN THE BUILDING A HOUSE AND AND A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE STRATEGIES RIGHT UP. THE CONVERSION OF THE GOD A CULTURAL FOR US A SOLID WASTE STREAMS. AS WELL AS YOU DO A SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS LIKE METHANE. INTO VALUABLE CARBON NEGATIVE AND GOVERNOR TO BUY YOUR FIELDS AND BIOPRODUCTS. USING BIOTECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO VERY IMPORTANT. BUT IT FACES SOME UNIQUE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WHICH REQUEST FOR THE RESEARCH AND IT GOES BACK TO WHAT MR NICHOLS WAS SAYING. THAT IT IS OVERLY STUDIOUS AS WHICH IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THOSE BREAKTHROUGHS. AND FINALLY IN TOM SAW FOR THE ENERGY. OR DOING OF WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ONE THING WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS V. ALSO MUST DRAMATICALLY REDUCE ENERGY USE ASSOCIATED. MOVING IN THE AD THE SALINITY WATER THAT SCARED BECAUSE DESALINATION OF WATER IT IS VERY VERY AND AND AND MANAGEMENT. SO. LBNL THE BERKELEY LAB HAS BEEN PARTNERING WITH CALIFORNIA UTILITIES AND PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS TO CREATE FLEXIBLE BUILDING AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMER. ENERGY LOADS. THAT CAN HELP INTEGRATE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY TO THE GRID. UP FOR EXAMPLE SIMILAR POLITICAL ENERGY STORAGE MANY CUSTOMER LORD SUCH AIR CONDITIONING. OR WATER HEATING CAN BE CHARGED AND DISCHARGED RIGHT AND THAT COULD YOU CAN MATCH IT WITH A SWORD OR LOOK A SORT OF GENERATION. ALL MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED OLDER TO DEVELOP COMMON OPEN INTEROPERABLE METHODS FOR CONTROLLING AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER AND USE LOTS. R. L. BEEN AND AN L. IS ALSO THE BURKE LABS AS CONTINUING FORM WHAT FUNDED BY A CITY YOU SEE. TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF DEMAND TO SPONSOR RESOURCES. UP RESOURCE POTENTIAL INCLUDING SHIPPING LORDS WITH DYNAMIC PRICING AND SHIFTING DEMAND. DOCTOR Y USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SO THAT'S ONE STRATEGY HOW DO YOU MIND IS THE LOOK. SECOND STUDY AS YOU POINTED OUT IS ENERGY STORAGE. UP SO THE BERKELEY LAB AND OTHER COLLEAGUES OF OTHER LABS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S TRADITIONS AND EVEN A PRIVATE RESEARCH LABS. HAVE BEEN WORKING ON VARIOUS ENERGY SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING ELECTROCHEMICAL SORT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THOMAS WAS TECHNOLOGIES. CHALLENGES ELECTROCHEMICAL STORAGE SUCH A LEAVE HIM ON BATTERY. IS GOING TO BE SAFETY AND THIS CASA DEAL CRITICAL MATERIAL SUCH AS CORD AND I HEARD IT IN THE FEWEST BOTTLE THAT WAS DISCUSSED QUITE A BIT. AND WHICH IS A SEE THIS CHALLENGE. V. HAVE ACTUALLY EMBARKED OR DELETE FUNDED PROGRAM TO SOLVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS DISCUSSES THE RESOURCES OF THE COURT WHICH IS ABOUT YOU SIGNIFICANTLY IN TODAY'S THE TIME ABOUT. THREE THE TWO APPROACHES ONE IS HOW DO YOU DO FOR A DOUBLE UP. A LITTLE ABOUT THE WAS DOES NOT USE ANY COURT THAT'S CRITICAL WARD FORGET HIM ON BATTERY. AND SECOND ONE IS A RECYCLING GOLF THE CURRENTLY COMING BATTERIES SO THAT HE COULD RETRIEVE A LOT OF THESE MINERALS FROM THE OF THE FOR THE THE THE THE BATTERIES THESE ARE BOTH GOING TO PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FUTURE. AND AT THE SAME TIME THOMAS STORAGE IS ANOTHER STRATEGY IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUILDING. ALMOST 50% ENERGY GOES IN HEATING OR COOLING. SO THOMAS STORAGE CAN BE ANOTHER VIABLE OPTION SO THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR TO DISTRIBUTE IT AND THE DISTORTED. AS WELL AS CAN PROVIDE VERY ZONA CLIMATE CONDITIONING OF THE BUILDING WHICH WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT. A NEW A OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE IN THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE BUILDING RIGHT RIGHT. AND FINALLY ONE ONE TO ADMIT IT BUT I'M SURE AS HELL PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE THEIR BEDROOM WARM IS AT EIGHT BUT THEY DON'T NEED THE LIVING ROOM THAT THEY DON'T NEED THAT EVEN TO THE ALL THIS RESOURCE YES YOU KNOW HOUSE WARM YES. YOU'RE NOT THAT CAN BE ENABLED IF YOU HAVE A STORAGE IN THE IN THE WALLS OF THE BUILDING. AND AND ONE AND LOST ONE AND REYES STRATEGY IS SOMETHING ON THE GRID INTERACTIVE EFFICIENT BUILDING SO TODAY. IF YOU LOOK AT A BROADLY SPEAKING. LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF THE BURNING BODIES SEPARATE AND WALKED IN THE SUPPLY FROM THE GREAT. BUT WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS OUR IS THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM LEVEL YOU'RE ARE SCANNED THE BUILDING CONTINUOUSLY INTERACT WITH THE GOOD. SO THAT WE HAVE A HIGHLY EFFICIENT. SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDE BORDER OF THE DEMAND SIDE AND THE SUPPLY SIDE AND LOOKING AT I VERY HOLISTICALLY. AND IN FACT DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S DIVERTING SIGNIFICANTLY IN THAT DIRECTION BEFORE NEED A LOT OF RESEARCH IS SOMETHING CALLED A GRID INTERACTIVE EFFICIENT BUILDINGS YEAH. UP CONTRIBUTOR A MUCH TIME I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE THAT UP YOU KNOW V. DIVIDE THE STATE HAS MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING DEEP REDUCTIONS. UP IENEN VIEILLE NEEDED A CgA A ROBUST MULTI PRONG STUDY TOUCHES DEDUCTIONS. AND I WANT TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WHAT ROLE MR DICK UPSET. BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN AT LEAST IN MY OPINION IN THE FREE LOVE CANADIAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY IS THAT IF THERE IS A NEW BIXEL TODAY. IT TAKES ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS FOR THAT BREAK THROUGH THE MATERIALIZE INTO A VIABLE MARKET READY TECHNOLOGIES RESOLUTION A STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN PLAY A VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE. TO TO BRIDGE THAT GAP. AND UNDER THAT I'LL JUST MOVE FUNDING BUT FUNDING OF COURSE YES MA'AM. YEAH BUT WITH THE BE SURELY THE SAME REASONS WHY IT'S HARD TO GET PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING BECAUSE IT'S SO SPECULATIVE RIGHT. MILT EMILY HOW HOW DOES HOW DOES THE STATE FIGURE OUT A WAY OF PICKING LOSE I I CAN I IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S NOT AS YOU TECHNOLOGY I THINK I WILL BROUGHT UNDER TO ANY HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY. IT TAKES A LOT OF EMPIRICAL DATA SUGGESTS THAT IT TAKES ROUGHLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY IS EVEN RESPECTIVE OFF THE END OF LOCATION. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT NEXT COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY STILL TO GET FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS. BECAUSE HARDWARE IS JUST A TALENTED IS A LOT OF TRIAL AND ERROR. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH WE HAVE STARTED AT THE LOT AND ORDERED PARTS OF DEAL HE HAS STARTED LOOKING INTO SOMETHING CALL SIGNS OF SKILL UP. HOW DO YOU START DOING A LAW OF SINES RIGHT IN THE BIG INTO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU WOULD FACING SKINNING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY? SO RATHER THAN GOING FROM A LINEAR MODEL OF INNOVATION VERY OF DISCOVERY THAN. ENGINEERING THAT MARKET LOOKING OVER THE CIRCULAR MORTAL OFF OFF OFF ARE DOING -- OF THE DISCOVERY TO DEVICES. AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WHICH I WOULD SAY IS IS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN HOW YOU DO. A TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND I'M FINDING IT IS A QUITE FRANKLY WILL HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF A MODEL IF. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I'VE NEXT THAT TO HEAR FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TALK ABOUT ANOTHER INTERESTING SERIES OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND DOCTOR BONE. THANK YOU. CAROLYN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABS THOUGHT ON SOME TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PURSUE TO REACH SOME OF ITS CLIMATE GOALS. MY NAME IS STEVE BOWLING ALLEY THE ENERGY AND HOMELAND SECURITY PROGRAM AT LIVERMORE. I'M ALSO GRATEFUL THAT THIS IS A LITTLE MORE RELAXED SETTING THAN THE PREVIOUS TIME I WAS IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE WHEN I WAS ON GAS SUPERVISOR. AND THE HEAD OF THE DIVISION OF OIL AND GAS DURING A VERY CHALLENGING TIME IF YOU'LL REMEMBER FEAR OF SENATOR. THE THE STATE FACES MANY CHALLENGES BUT ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND CHAIR LOCAL MUCH MORE RESTED FOR THE FACT THAT. I AM ACTUALLY I SLEEP AT NIGHT NOW. WE ARE TWINS WELL AND MY KIDS ARE A LITTLE OLDER SO I I'VE BEEN IN THAT SLEEPLESS STAYS. WITH BACK A FEW YEARS AGO -- WELL THE CHALLENGES THE STATE FACES INSURE NICHOLS MENTIONED THIS IS THE CHALLENGE OF EMISSIONS FROM FROM -- VEHICLES. IT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE AND AND ONE THAT'S NOT EASILY TACKLED. IF YOU ADD THE ENERGY. EMISSIONS FROM THE PRODUCTION OF OIL IN THE STATE AND THE REFINING OIL THE STATE. TO THE EMISSIONS OF ROUGHLY TWENTY BECAUSE IN THE STATE OF ALL TYPES -- THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE STATE'S EMISSIONS THAT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION TONS. OF CO TWO A YEAR. AND THEN DEALING WITH THAT. IS IS IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE EVEN BY OPTIMISTIC. PROJECTIONS OF OF THE BUILD OUT OF THE ELECTRIC -- FOR VEHICLE FLEET IN THE STATE. OIL AND AND I I A GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL WILL STILL BE THE PREDOMINANT FUEL -- WELL INTO THE MID CENTURY -- EVEN IF YOU HAVE A BATTERY -- TECHNOLOGY BREAKS THROUGH -- ENERGY DENSITY DOUBLES OR TRIPLES COST DECREASE -- AND SAFETY IMPROVES. ITS FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN GET THAT INTO THE MARKET AS YOU JUST HEARD -- AND THE HALF LIFE OF AUTOMOBILES IN THE STATE IS FIFTEEN YEARS ROUGHLY. SO SO THERE'S THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET HERE IN IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. NOW FORTUNATELY THE STATUS HAD THE FORESIGHT TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL MECHANISMS FOR INCENTIVIZING NEW APPROACHES AROUND CARBON PRODUCTION OF THE TRANSPORTATION -- A SECTOR AND THAT'S THROUGH LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD -- THE FINANCIAL SICK IS THE INCENTIVE IS SIGNIFICANT IT IT IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A MARKET -- AND IT AND IT GOES UP AND DOWN BUT IT IT MAY ACTUALLY -- PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR D. CARBONIZATION PORTION OF THIS -- YOU KNOW MANY ANALYSTS ANALYSTS SUGGEST THAT THE STATE NEEDS. TO SECURELY TO DISPOSE OF ITS CURRENT EMISSIONS ALONG WITH SOME CO TO CAPTURE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. DEEP UNDERGROUND SOME BILLS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE FOR CCS SOMETIMES C. C. U. S. CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION AND STORAGE. AND YOU KNOW DO IT DESPITE ITS LOW PROFILE THE TECHNOLOGY IS ACTUALLY QUITE MATURE. THEIR SIXTEEN PROJECTS OPERATING WORLDWIDE. THERE'S GONNA BE FIVE OR SIX MORE BY -- TWENTY TWENTY AND THESE ARE A ROBUST PROJECTS FAIRLY LARGE -- DEBTORS SEQUESTERING MILLIONS OF TONS OF CO -- TWO AND THERE HAVE BEEN A SERIES OF ADVANCES IN HOW. TO MONITOR THE INJECTION OF CO TWO WITH OTHER RISKS SUCH AS INDUCED SEISMICITY. SO THE TECHNOLOGICAL STAGE HAS BEEN SET FOR THE STATE TO REMOVE SOME OF ITS TRANSPORTATION MISSIONS BY CAPTURING CO TWO REFINERIES AND ETHANOL PLANTS. AND SEQUESTERING IT SECURELY UNDERGROUND. AND IN ADDITION THE STATE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY EARLIER -- YOU ALLUDED SENATOR TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN THE STATE -- IF YOU THINK ABOUT BUILDING A ROBUST CARBON SECRET GEOLOGIC CARBON SEQUESTRATION INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN TO FROM IN ADMITTING-- INDUSTRY INTO A SEQUESTERING OR REDUCING -- INDUSTRY. COME. AND IN THE PROCESS YOU CAN OF REDIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DIRECT HIGH PAYING JOBS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE CARBONIZATION. THE INDUSTRY HAS ESSENTIAL EXPERTISE FOR UNDERGROUND INJECTION. AND COMBINED WITH THE STATE'S NEW WELL OF PREPARED REGULATIONS. RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE OR BOARD FOR GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATION -- IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION FOR A A SAFE AND SECURE PROGRAM -- IT PROVIDES A CCS PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO TRANSFORM A CARBON pCENTRAL VALLEY JOBS AND MANAGE A PORTION OF THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. THE STATE IS BLESSED WITH EXCELLENT GEOLOGY FOR THIS AN INITIAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT OVER TWO BILLION TONS OF CO. TWO COULD BE SEQUESTERED IN JUST THE DEPLETED OIL RESERVOIRS OF THE STATE ALONE. THERE ARE OTHER RESERVOIRS IN THE STATE THE COULD HANDLE CO TWO BUT JUSTIN THAT ALONE. IS FIFTY MILLION TONS A YEAR POTENTIALLY. THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY EQUALS THE EMISSIONS THAT ARE GENERATED BY THE IN STATE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND THE BURNING OF THAT OIL PRODUCED IN THE STATE. SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IS A IS A VIABLE TECHNOLOGY -- TO CREATE AN INDUSTRY THAT IS CARBON NEUTRAL AND AND LEAD THE WORLD IN THAT WAY. THE CHALLENGES THAT THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD CREDITS PROBABLY AREN'T ENOUGH AND AND TO GROW A VIABLE CO TWO STORAGE INDUSTRY THE STATE NEEDS. TO ASSESS THE REGULATORY PATH. ADELINE AND STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE DIVISION OF OIL AND GAS. THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARD STATE LANDS COMMISSION AIR DISTRICTS COUNTIES. AND TO CONSIDER SEQUEL. EVEN WITH A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FILE CASF THE PERCEIVED HIGH REGULATORY RISK. AND THE AND THE SEVERAL YEARS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN SLUG THROUGH THE AND THROUGH THE PERMITTING MAYES. MAY PREVENT THE BUILDING OF MUCH NEEDED PROJECTS. I EMPHASIZE A FIFTY MILLION TONS YEARS ONLY 25% OF THE SOLUTION. AND OTHER APPROACHES ARE NEEDED. THERE'S HUGE POTENTIAL IN AGRICULTURAL SOILS FOR LONG TERM CARBON STORAGE ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT THE RETURN OF SOIL CARBON. OF THE AGRICULTURAL STORES SOILS OF THE STATE OF IOWA ALONE -- TO PRE DUST PULLED. PRE DECIBEL LEVELS BECAUSE THE QUEST FOR A HUNDRED BILLION TONS OF CO -- TWO THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE AGRICULTURAL SOILS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS FOR SIMILAR SIMILAR LEVELS OF STORAGE. HOWEVER OUR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING AND VIABLE PATHWAYS FOR STORAGE AND SO SOILS LONG TERM. OUR EMBRYONIC COMPARED WITH CCS AND MUCH MORE WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE. THERE ARE ANOTHER OTHER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR EXAMPLE PYROLYTIC CONVERSION OF FOREST WAYS TO BIO FUELS. THE STATE HAS A PLAN -- TO TO THIN A MILLION ACRES A YEAR -- THAT PRODUCES OF BIO -- THAT PRODUCES FOREST WASTE. THAT IF YOU BURN IT YOU GET A SEAT. ZERO TWO EMISSIONS -- IF YOU LET IT ROT YOU GET CO TWO EMISSIONS BUT IF YOU TURN IT INTO BIO FUEL YOU CAN REDUCE. THE THE ABOUT. AND MANAGE THE CO TWO THAT COMES FROM THAT AND AS THE QUESTRADE UNDERGROUND -- SO -- PYROLYTIC CONVERSION OF FOREST WAYS TO BIO FUELS DIRECTOR CAPTURE AND CATALYTIC CONVERSION OF THE CO TWO TWO USEFUL PRODUCTS INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION FUELS. ARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE BEING WORKED ON RIGHT NOW. ALL THESE ARE MAKING PROGRESS BUT ARE FAR FROM READY TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS THAT THE STATE HAS. IN UMMARY WE SEE CCS IS A PROVEN VIABLE TECHNOLOGY TO HELP THE STATE IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM. TO DEAL WITH INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. THIS IS REALLY A TRANCE TRANSITIONAL TECHNOLOGY WE'RE NOT GOING TO STORE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BUY TIME. AND AND TIME IS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IF WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM AGGRESSIVELY -- FROM THE EARLY NINETIES WHEN IT WAS CLEAR IT WAS A PROBLEM WE MIGHT BE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION. BUT WE NEED ALL ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE HOW DO YOU CAPTURE THE CARBON AS PART OF THIS. SO -- THE ACCOUNT WELL IF YOU CAN'T YOU CAN CAPTURE FROM OF THE REFINERIES. IF YOU HURT CARBON CAPTURE AND VICES DEVICES ON THE RISE THE NICE THING ABOUT REFINERIES IS pIS THAT THE CO TWO STREAM IS RELATIVELY CLEAN -- FAIR AND BUT YOU CAN CAPTURE IT DIRECTLY FROM THE AIR AS WELL IN IS AS YOU HEARD CHAIR NICHOLS THAT'S THAT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY THAT'S QUITE READY FOR PRIME TIME IT'S MAKING GOOD PROGRESS. BUT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO THEN TAKE OUT CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND OTHER TOXICS. SPECIALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OR AROUND THE OIL FIELDS. AND SUCK ALL THAT STUFF OUT AND PUT IT UNDERGROUND SO THE CCO TO THE GOES UNDERGROUND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECTLY PURE. FACT THE ETHANOL PLANTS ACTUALLY SYQUEST TO THE FOOD INDUSTRY AT A LOSS -- REFINERIES DON'T SEQUESTER CO TWO RIGHT NOW THERE'S A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT PRODUCER DO IT. ARE THEY PUTTING YOUR COKE. TO GET BACK IN THE ATMOSPHERE. GROWTH OF OR OR THE RICE PRODUCERS PUT IT IN TO FUMIGATE THEIR THEIR SILOS THINGS LIKE THAT CRIME -- I SEE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD YOU KNOW IN NOT IN YOUR HEAD DOCTOR PRESSURE YOU YOU'RE INTO THIS TECHNOLOGY OR I MEAN I THINK -- THEIR TICKETS CONTROVERSIAL I SUPPOSE RALLY HAVE SOURCE CAPTURE IS STILL VERY EXPENSIVE RIGHT IT IS A AND THAT IS GOING TO FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE I MEAN CHEMISTRY IS USED IN SEPARATING THE AT THE SHE WOULD DO FROM THERE. AND I MEAN KIM IS IS -- IS ENERGY INTENSIVE PROCESS BUT JOBS ALL THIS YEAR DO YOU HAVE BEEN HEATED UP. TO GET THIS YOU WILL BE OUT. SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WORLD ENERGY ACCOUNTING OF THE CARBON SICK THE SENATE THERE ARE NEW TECHNOLOGIES COMING ALONG THERE ARE LESS ENERGY INTENSE YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH. WITH THE ONES YOU CAPTURE IT RIGHT AND YEAH I MEAN HAVING YOUR STRESS TAUGHT IT FINALLY DO SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS GOING TO BE THAT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GONNA CAPTURED IT. THE AFTER DAHLE SUPPORTED SUMMER TO SEQUESTER AGAIN SUGGESTED I TWENTY CAPTURED RIGHT RIGHT THIS A BIG DECISIONS TO BE MADE -- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AS YOU AS YOU POINTED OUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT. YOU HAVE A ABOVE IN TERMS OF THE THROUGH THE BPM OF CO TWO WE ALREADY HOUSE GASES IN THE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. AND SO ARE A VALID ALLOCATED SIXTY FIFTY PPM THAN. I MEAN THERE'S NO WAY OUT CAM YOU HAVE. I'M A PRAGMATIST IN THIS WAY THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS THAT EVERYTHING IS HARD THAT'S WHY THE PROBLEM IS HARD RIGHT. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO YOU'VE GOT TO PUT EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE AND TO AND FIGURED OUT THERE ARE THERE IS A REFINERY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF BAKERSFIELD THAT YOU CAPTURE THAT CO TWO INPUT RIGHT UNDERGROUND IN THE OILFIELDS THERE. THERE ARE THERE ARE. RELATIVELY LOW HANGING FRUIT. THE TREES CALL BUT THE FOR FOR THESE VERY CHALLENGING PROBLEMS BUT IS YOUR EASY THE PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED RIGHT OF COURSE. OKAY ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU BALL. YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY DONE THE STOCK DOCTOR I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THANK OVER IT. AND AND YOU KNOW I'VE GOT I'VE CAUCUS STARTING ALREADY SRT STARTED SO WHEN WE GOT TO HEAR PUBLIC COMMENTS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IF YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY PRESENTATIONS I LOOK FOR TO FONG UP WITH EACH OF YOU. ON SEVERAL ISSUES SELF THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU RUNNING IN FRIGHT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED THANKS FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WENT BEHIND IT IS THAT. THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING. ITSELF OKAY. LOOKS SO I I I BEG OF YOU TO BE SHORT -- AND AND CONCISE AYE MINUTES STRICTLY LIMIT EVERY COMMENT TO TWO MINUTES IF YOU COULD DO IT SHORTER I WOULD REALLY PERSONALLY BY LILY HAVE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS -- ALREADY BEGUN SO UNDERSTOOD FEATURE ALEX JACKSON WITH ENERGY SEE I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO SOME THE CONVERSATION EARLIER WHICH SEEM TO SUGGEST AS WE LOOK AHEAD WE'RE GOING TO FACE THE FINAL TENSION BETWEEN AFFORDABILITY AND A SAFE CLIMATE. AND I THINK THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE THUS FAR -- AS OUR HOMES BUILDINGS AND VEHICLES GET MORE EFFICIENT CALIFORNIA'S ARE ACTUALLY SAVING MONEY. EVEN AFER ACCOUNTING FOR INDUSTRIES COMPLIANCE COSTS AND WITH SMART PROTECTIONS LIKE OUR CLIMATE CREDIT WOULD PROVIDE A LUMP SON BILL -- TO ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT AND NOW HE'S OF SHOWN THAT IS ACTUALLY ALLOWING LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO BENEFIT FINANCIALLY FROM OUR PROGRAM. THANK SHOULD PROVIDE SOME COMFORT THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AGGRESSIVELY AND THAT WE CAN DO SO NOT ON THE BACKS OF OF LOGAN CALIFORNIA SO YES WE NEED TO RAISE OURS. OUR AMBITION BUT REALLY THE PATH WE CAN LEAST AFFORD IS DOING NOTHING YEAH. YEAH GREAT OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR MY NAME IS THE BILL QUINN I'M THE THE PRESIDENT SINCE BEGINNING WITH YOUR OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR MY MONIQUE MY BALANCE ARE KNOWN AS C.. R. C. WAS A COALITION OF BUSINESS LABOR IN PUBLIC LEADERS BEEN HERE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CLIMATE DISCUSSION WORK ON AB THREE TO SB THREE TO A. B.. THIRTY THREE NINETY EIGHT THE SCOPING PLAN. OF APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY BUT GIVEN THE TIME WHAT% I'D LIKE TO DO SIMPLY OFFER TO MEET WITH YOU. TO SIT DOWN AND GO THROUGH THE LAW OF THE VIEWS OF THE CLIMATE OVER TO COME COMPLIANCE ENTITIES AND THEIR UNIONS ON THE STATE'S PLAN A PROGRAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU. TO GO OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA MISLI TILDES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FORTY PUBLICLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES IN THE STATE WE SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH APPROACH ACROSS SECTORS TO ACHIEVE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. EL KNOWIT'S BEEN SAID OF A FEW TIMES IN THIS HEARING THAT THE LECTURE SECTOR IS REALLY LEADING THE WAY ON EMISSION REDUCTIONS -- THERE'S A SECTOR SPECIFIC GOAL OF 72% -- EMISSION REDUCTIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY AB AFFORDABILITY FOR OUR MEMBERS IS A REALLY BIG ISSUE WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN. BE SUSTAINABLE AND REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS WHILE KEEPING ELECTRIC RATES AFFORDABLE A LOT RESTS ON THE ABILITY OF ELECTRIC RATE ELECTRIC PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY AT AFFORDABLE RATES. ROLLOUT OF UBS FOR EXAMPLE AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION THAT CONCERN THANK YOU AND HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU. ERIN WITH UNION CONCERNED SCIENTISTS -- I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY JUST A COUPLE CONSERVE OUR COMMENTS FIRST WE SHARE THE CONCERN THAT AN ACCESS A BANK ALLOWANCES IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. BECAUSE EMISSIONS TO EXCEED CALIFORNIA'S LEGALLY BINDING TWENTY THIRTY LIMóN AS OTHERS ARE PREVIOUSLY NOTED ABILITY TO BANK ALLOWANCES USE IN THE FUTURE MEANS THAT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM PROVIDES A HARD CAP ON Q. MOTHER THE MISSIONS. OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY NOT A HARD CAP ON MISSIONS IN TWENTY THIRTY INCREDULOUSLY DURING CARP TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE REST AN OVERSUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES WILL UNDERMINE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS INTENDED ROLE AS A BACKSTOP TO ME TWENTY SB THIRTY TWO LIMITS -- AND THEN I WANT TO RETURN TO A POINT THAT DOCTOR BROWN MADE N HIS REMARKS REGARDING THE USE OF CARBON PRICING VERSUS COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES YOU SEE US FOR SUPPORT CURRENT PRICING IS IMPORTANT TOOL. REDUCING CRIME AT POLLUTION BUT WE BELIEVE IN EVEN MORE STRONGLY IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT OTHER FOUNDATION OF POLICIES THAT REDUCE EMISSIONS FOSTER INNOVATION IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCE VALUABLE COULD BENEFITS. FOR COMMITTEES ACROSS STATE THINKING. YEP YEP ALL SET THE I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK ALSO TO SOMETHING DOCTOR BROWN TALKED ABOUT THE LA OVER FOUR EIGHT KNOWLEDGE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF FEELING OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS -- AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE ATMOSPHERE CARES ABOUT AND RAN REALLY ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING OUR CLIMATE AND PULLS WRIT LARGE -- WE SEE BANKING ACTUALLY IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO HELP ACHIEVE EARLY EMISSION REDUCTIONS WHICH ARE OF COURSE ESSENTIAL TO GREATER CUMULATIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS -- SO SO I THINK THAT POINT NEEDS TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT TAT BANKING DOES INCENTIVIZE THOSE REDUCTIONS AND AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO WE SEE THAT THE BANK OF ALLOWANCES. SET YOUR OF YOUR WHAT ARE DISCRIMINATION OCCURS IT BECAUSE THEY SURE I MEAN THAT CONCERN I I'M MY BEST UNDERSTANDING THEIR CONCERNS THAT. IT'S JUST BEEN A FOR YOUR FOR FOLKS. TO SORT OF BY A CREDITS INTO THE FUTURE AND AND SO. SURE SO HOW WE SEE IT IS THAT OF ALLOWANCES PURCHASE NOW AND NOT USE NOW REPRESENTS A TON OF THE MISSIONS IS NOT EMITTED NOW SO THAT IS THERE FOR LESS TIME. MEAN DECADES IN THIS CASE AT THAT TIME ISN'T DAMAGING THE ATMOSPHERE -- BUT I THINK THERE'S A YOU KNOW OF THE FURTHER POINT THAT BY HAVING THIS MAN OF ALLOWANCES. OF THIS ALSO REALLY INCENTIVIZE IS CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY TAKES STEPS BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE THIRTY AND SET TARGETS FURTHER OUT -- THE BANK OF ALLOWANCES MIGHT BE A GREATER THREAT IF WE KNEW THAT CAP AND TRADE WAS GOING TO END IN -- TWENTY THIRTY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO YOU KNOW I'M ENOUGH OF AN OPTIMIST NOT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO I THINK IF WE LOOK OUT PAST. TWENTY THIRTY THAT WOULD ELIMINATE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS -- AND I THINK THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE RATE IS NOT THE END ALL BE ALL TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS THERE'S A LOT MORE AT THAT THE STATE CAN BE DOING AN ETF IS REALLY INTERESTED IN SCENES STATE TO MORE ON HEAVY DUTY ELECTRIFICATION BUILDING THE CARBONIZATION. PRODUCING METHANE EMISSIONS THAT SORT OF THING YEAH. YEAH YEAH MAKES MUCH ALL RIGHT THANK YOU EVERYBODY REALLY DO APPRECIATE AYE AYE THING AT THE THOUGHTFUL AND AND AND AND IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AND AND YOU KNOW LIKE THE LIKE ALL THE BEST HEARINGS. THEY OFTEN LEAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS OF BUT I DO BUT I'VE I DO WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS IN THE AND THE FOLKS WHO JUST CAME IN TO SPEAK. I KNOW HOW MUCH WORK GOES BEHIND THESE PRESENTATIONS AND AND AND ALL THE OTHER DAY REFLECTS OF THANK YOU TO YOU THANK YOU TO OUR STAFF -- AND WITH THAT THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED
