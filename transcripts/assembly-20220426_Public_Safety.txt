CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO THIS BILL ADDRESSES SKYROCKETING RATES OF CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT BY REQUIRING CAR DEALERS TO PERMANENTLY MARK CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WITH THE VIN OF THE VEHICLE TO WHICH THEY ARE ATTACHED CRIMINALIZING THE TAMPERING OF REMOVAL OF THAT BEEN MARKING AND REQUIRING SMOG CHECKS TO INCLUDE A NOTIFICATION TO DRIVERS ABOUT WHETHER THEIR CATALYTIC CONVERTER HAS BEEN MARKED THESE PARTS WORK -- COMPONENT VEHICLES EXHAUST SYSTEM THAT REDUCES OUR HARMFUL AIR EMISSIONS BY CONVERTING HYDROCARBONS AND CARBON MONOXIDE INTO LAW WATER VAPOR AND CARBON DIOXIDE IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THEY CONTAIN PRECIOUS METALS LIKE PALLADIUM RHODIUM AND PLATINUM WALL THEFT IS NOTHING NEW RECENT SPIKES IN THE VALUE OF PRECIOUS METALS TRACK A SPIKE IN THEFTS FOR EXAMPLE FIVE YEARS AGO RHODIUM COST EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS BUT NOW SELLS FOR MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER THAT SAME PERIOD THEFTS HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN TENFOLD IN CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL CLAIMS FILED WITH STATE FARM FOR EXAMPLE HIGH PRICES FOR THE PRECIOUS METALS FOUND IN THESE CONVERTERS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DUE TO SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE WITH RUSSIA PRODUCING ALMOST FORTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S MIND PALLADIUM SO LONG AS THIS FINANCIAL INCENTIVE EXISTS WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE THESE THEFTS CONTINUE WHILE VEHICLES MOST OFTEN HIT BY THIEVES INCLUDING SUVS AND FLEET VEHICLES WITH HIGH GROUND CLEARANCE AS WELL AS THE TOYOTA PRIUS ANY VEHICLE CAN BE TARGETED ONE STOLEN THIEVES TYPICALLY FLIP THESE PARTS FOR FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHILE VICTIMS CAN EXPECT TO PAY ANYWHERE FROM ONE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THE VEHICLE FIXED UNLESS THE THIEF IS CAUGHT IN THE ACT RED HANDED LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS FEW TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE THIS CRIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO LINK AN INDIVIDUAL WITH ANY SPECIFIC STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTER RIGHT NOW LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN PULL OVER A SUSPECT WITH DOZENS OF STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS SITTING IN THEIR TRUNK AND HAVE NO MECHANISM TO HOLD THAT INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABLE AS A RESULT EVEN WHEN A SUSPECT IS ARRESTED MANY ARE NEVER PROSECUTED CONSISTENT WITH BEST PRACTICES RECOMMENDED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO REQUIRES THE PERMANENT MARKING OF KHALKHIN BURGER WITH THE VEHICLES THAT UNDER THIS BILL DOES HAVE SCALLOP CONVERTER CAN BE EASILY TRACED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL VEHICLE AND LEGAL OWNERSHIP CAN BE ESTABLISHED IF THE MARKING ON THE PART IS REMOVED THE POSSESSION OF THAT PART IS A CRIME WHICH WILL SERVE AS A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT FOR ANY BLACK MARKET REPAIR SHOP OR METAL RECYCLER STORM PART I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- THIS BILL REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS -- THERE ARE SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION ABOUT ENSURING THE MARKING REQUIREMENT IS SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE AND SUFFICIENTLY NARROW FOR EXAMPLE THE CAR DEALERS ARE PROVIDE COMPELLING INFORMATION THAT HIGHLIGHTS VARIOUS EXHAUSTED SIGNS SOME OF WHICH VERY THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER DEEP INSIDE THE VEHICLE REQUIRING DEALERS TO MAKE A CALLACHAN BIRD WITH THIS DESIGN IS IMPRACTICAL AS THEY WOULD HAVE TO DISASSEMBLE MAJOR ENGINE COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE PART FORTUNATELY THE SAME DESIGN ALSO MAKES ACCESSING THAT COVER DIFFICULT FOR THIEVES -- AND THOSE VEHICLES ARE USUALLY NOT TARGETED I'M COMMITTED TO TAKING FUTURE AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS THESE PRACTICAL CONCERNS AND I APPRECIATE TO PRODUCTIE STATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE OPPOSITION SO FAR -- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE JONATHON FELDMAN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION TRAVIS AUSTIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR FOR A WE COULD HAVE THEM APPROACHING LOW OKAY THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY SO THEY'RE NOT HERE I HAVE FALSE ALARMS SO EASY OPERATION YOU HAVE HAS OFTEN EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR DO YOU HAVE TRAVIS AUSTIN ON THE TELEPHONE TESTIFIED COVERING DISTRIBUTOR AND I'M I'M HERE -- YOU MAY BEGIN WHILE WE WAIT FOR JONATHAN TO ATTEND THANK YOU THANK YOU TRAVIS AUSTIN AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CRIME CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT POSES UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THOSE CHALLENGES HEAD ON CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT IS DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE BECAUSE THE CRIME ITSELF CAN BE COMPLETED IN MINUTES AND THE STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS ARE TYPICALLY DEVOID OF ANY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION THIS MEANS THAT UNLESS THE PERPETRATORS CAUGHT IN THE ACT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTER THE STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS ARE THEN TYPICALLY SOLD TO AUTO DISMANTLING OR SCRAP METAL YARDS OR CORPS RECYCLERS OR THEY ARE OFTEN MIXED IN WITH LEGITIMATELY OBTAIN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AT THESE BUSINESSES EVEN IF CURRENT RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS ARE COMPLIED WITH IT IT'S SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCERN WHAT PART OF THEIR INVENTORY IS COMPRISED OF STOLEN PROPERTY NOW IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE ANY RECEIPT OF STOLEN PROPERTY CASE THE THRESHOLD DETERMINATION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE PROPERTY IS ACTUALLY STOLEN WITHOUT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER ONE FOR SENATE SIMPLY IS UNABLE TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION THIS BILL SOLVES THAT PROBLEM BY ENSURING THAT ALL NEW OR USED VEHICLES ARE EQUIPPED WITH CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THAT ARE PERMANENTLY MARKED WITH THE VIN NUMBER THIS BILL GIVES LAW ENFORCEMENT THE ABILITY TO CROSS REFERENCE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THEY ARE INVESTIGATING WITH KNOWN STEP STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DETERMINE HOW MANY CATALYTIC CONVERTERS IN THE BUSINESSES INVENTORY ARE REPORTED STOLEN AND CREATED CHAIN OF CUSTODY THAT LEADS BACK TO THE VICTIM OF THE FAST IDENTIFYING THE VICTIM IS CRITICAL AND ANY SUBSEQUENT PROSECUTION IN CONCLUSION THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY ASSIST LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT WILL PROVIDE JUSTICE TO MORE VICTIMS IN THE TURF CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU THANK YOU -- MR FELDMAN IN THE ROOM BUT SEEING HIM THERE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES ARE THERE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF -- AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO GREAT SPEAKING

WILL GO STRAIGHT TO YOU I MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS APOLOGIES FOR BEING LATE -- LOTTA CONSTRUCTION OUTSIDE -- JONATHON FELDMAN OUR STRATEGIES ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION -- APPRECIATE THE TIME THERE'S NO PANACEA TO SOLVE AN EXTRAORDINARY INCREASE IN CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CHANGES NEEDED TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT OF DEATHS OCCURRING IN AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE POLICY SOLUTION BY INCREASING THE NUMBER CATALYTIC CONVERTER CONVERTERS WITH THE VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ENGRAVED ON THE PART AND MAKING IT A VIOLATIONS KNOWINGLY POSSESS A CATALYTIC CONVERTER WITH THE VIN NUMBER REMOVED OR ALTERED LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL HAVE EVIDENCE NEEDED TO PROVE A CRIME WAS COMMITTED THIS ADDRESSES ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS LAW ENFORCEMENT FACES ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS THAT EVEN WHEN INDIVIDUALS FOUND IN POSSESSION OF MULTIPLE DETACH CATALYTIC CONVERTERS IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED WITHOUT EVIDENCE THE PARTS WERE STOLEN TO ADDRESS THIS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ACTUALLY IN MULTIPLE CITIES PARTNERED WITH AUTO REPAIR DEALERS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION TO OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET THEIR CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND GRAPE AND IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING STOLEN PARTS AND SOLVING CASES BY MAKING IT A STATEWIDE REQUIREMENT THAT MORE AND MORE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS BEING GRAPE LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE GIVEN THE ADVANTAGE TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM TARGETED THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL CURE BUT THERE ARE CRITICAL STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO MAKE AN IMPACT IN AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO TAKES A HUGE STRIDE FOR THAT REASON WE ASK FOR EITHER THANK YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO MAY BEGIN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TATUM ACKER WAS SAMPSON VISORS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION I SEE IN CDA HAS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO AND APPRECIATES THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE A DIALOGUE WITH US ON THIS BILL -- AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THIS MORNING AS WELL I'M THIRSTY IN CDA SUPPORTS THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF THE BILL AND TO THIS END CURRENTLY SUPPORTS OTHER CATALYTIC CONVERTER BILLS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON ENFORCEMENT AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL SEE INSIDIOUS CONCERNS RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT DEALERSHIPS PERMANENTLY MARK OR EDGE THE VIN NUMBER INTO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BEFORE THE VEHICLE CAN BE SOLD MANY VEHICLE MODELS INCORPORATE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS PART OF THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD REQUIRING DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS TO DISASSEMBLE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE VEHICLE ENGINE JUST TO ACCESS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER I AM JUST BY WAY OF TWO EXAMPLES TO PERMANENTLY MARK ONE FOOTBALL THE MODEL IT WOULD TAKE A DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS TWO POINT EIGHT TO FOUR HOURS TO PERMANENTLY MARK ONE VEHICLE DEPENDING ON THE ENGINE VARIANTS AND FOR CERTAIN ACURA MODELS AND IT CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FIVE HOURS SO I AM C. AND C. A. AS I MENTIONED REALLY APPRECIATES THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON A MORE TARGETED IN STREAMLINED SOLUTION WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS ARE NOT SADDLED WITH THE LABOR INTENSIVE AND COSTLY OBLIGATION OF PERMANENTLY MARKING EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE THEY SELL THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN ROME THE MOBILE TO THE PHONE LINES WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION OF H. B. TWO SIX EIGHT TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME ONCE AGAIN IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE THIRTEEN YES HI THIS IS CURT AUGUSTINE HOW WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION -- WE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THE BILL BUT OUR -- I WANT TO COMMEND MR GRAY ON THE COMMENTS HE MADE TODAY MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WERE ECHOED BY THE NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION AND WE HOPE TO WORK ON THE ETCHING PROVISION OF THE BILL WITH MR GREY THANK YOU THANK YOU NOW LINE FORTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD OLYMPIA CAMPBELL IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WERE IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO THIS PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME NOTHING ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU WITHOUT BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BUT THE COURT ONE OF THE OPPOSE IT ONE OF THOSE IN THE POST SAID THAT -- IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL YOU CAN DAMAGE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WHEN YOU ADD TO IT HI HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO THAT WE HAVE -- YEAH I ACTUALLY CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU KNOW EVERY MODEL VEHICLE BUT FRANK THIS IS A SERVICE THAT IS CURRENTLY OFFERED SO IF YOU TOOK YOUR VEHICLE DOWN YOU CAN GET YOUR CALENDAR AT STE AT TODAY THAT IT'S -- MULTIPLE THERE MAY BE NUANCE IS STRICTLY BECAUSE MANY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OUTSIDE OF DISPATCHING -- TO ENSURE THAT THAT -- YOU KNOW VIN NUMBER IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CATHOLIC CONVERT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE MOVE THE BILL ITS RESPONSE TO SEE AFTER HAD A QUESTION FIRST AND THEN RESPECT EASE OF ACCESS THAT THAT WITNESS WAS TALKING ABOUT -- IS THERE ARE POTENTIAL FOR THOSE TYPE OF VEHICLES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EIGHT EIGHT I I THINK THE WHOLE OPERATION OF STEALING CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND THEY USUALLY GET HIM OFF OF TRUCKS BECAUSE THEY'RE EASILY ACCESSIBLE YOU CAN GET IN LIKE THREE OR FOUR MINUTES WITH A BLOW TORCH BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO THAT WITH A VOLVO OR WHERE AN ACURA AND -- SEWERS ARE YOU LOOKING INTO MAKING MAKING SOME EXEMPTIONS FOR -- THE VEHICLES THAT DON'T HAVE EASE AND THAT ARE NOT EASILY ACCESSED BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE TO BE EASY BUT DOES I COULD I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD MAKE THEM DO THAT WELL I THINK IT'S A FAIR POINT OF CONCERN OBVIOUSLY OFFER THAT UP IN MY INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS -- WE'RE ACTUALLY OPEN AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING BETWEEN MY OFFICE AND THE VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENT NEW CAR DEALERS AND MANUFACTURERS CETERA -- WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PRACTICAL A PATH FORWARD HERE -- SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE HAVE REQUIRED FEDERALLY EIGHTEEN PARTS INCLUDING THE TRANSMISSION THE ENGINE TO BE MARKED WITH A BAT RIGHT THAT'S PART OF THE FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT PREVENTION STANDARD THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN FORCE THIS IS A TIME TESTED PRACTICE -- THAT'S EFFECTIVE BUT -- WE OBVIOUSLY CONSIDER ALL OF THOSE FACTORS AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE IN THE SENSE OF REQUIRING A -- ENGINE TO BE TAKEN COMPLETELY APART IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE BUT SAME TIME WE WANT TO CAPTURE THE LARGEST NUMBER VEHICLES NIGHT I ALMOST DON'T GO A DAY IN MY OFFICE WITHOUT GETTING COMMUNICATION FROM CONSTITUENTS THAT THIS IS HAPPEN TO THEM RIGHT AND AND WHILE WE CERTAINLY WANT TO CONSIDER THE COST OF ETCHING OR -- PROVIDING THAT BEEN ON A CALCULATOR WE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE ONE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR COST OF THOSE CONSUMERS RIGHT THAT THEY HAVE NO RECOURSE -- IN ADDRESSING EITHER RIGHT RIGHT SO NO I'M NOT AGAINST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM BUT THERE'S OTHER SERIAL NUMBER YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT STAMPED ON ENGINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE THOSE AFTERMARKET THOSE DURING THE MANUFACTURING OR THE MANUFACTURER YEAH BECAUSE THAT MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY CAN LOOK INTO IT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMEWHERE ALL OF THE ABOVE IS ON THE TABLE AND I HAVE A RECORD OF BEING A PRETTY PRACTICAL OR LEGISLATOR AND I WILL CONTINUE -- -- TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU YES APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY A CATALYTIC CONVERTER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR -- ENDS THAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE REALLY REALLY SUFFERING FROM THIS ARE THAT AUTO BODY REPAIR SHOPS WHO HAVE SHARED WITH ME THAT THEIR BUSINESSES ARE ON THE VERGE OF GOING UNDER BECAUSE OF THIS OF THIS CONCERN I AM A LITTLE A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING AT THIS BE AT FOCUSED ON KNOWINGLY POSSESSING BECAUSE THERE IS THE POTENTIAL SCENARIO WHERE STARTS WORKING ON THAT CAR -- HAVE -- IS SHAVED OFF FOR UNIDENTIFIED -- CATALYTIC CONVERTER AS A PART OF THAT CAR THAT THEY GO TO REPAIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO -- AT THE REPORTER REGISTER OR INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE THAT THEY ARE TECHNICALLY IN KNOWING POSSESSION OF OF A LIKELY STOLEN -- KIND OF REPLACE PART SO I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THAT IN ANY FUTURE AMENDMENTS I TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT POTENTIAL SCENARIO WHICH WOULD PUT THE SAME PEOPLE -- AS A PART OF THE INDUSTRY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP SUPPORT THEM IN IN IN IN A BAD WAY I APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN ALL CERTAINLY -- HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS THE -- THE BEST SOLUTION AND I I CAN TELL YOU IN MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY -- I'VE SPOKEN WITH MY LOCAL SHERIFF WHERE HE KNOWS OF A BLACK MARKET OPERATION RECYCLER AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING WITH THE PARTS AND NOBODY CAN REST ANYBODY -- FOR POSSESSION OF THE STOLEN PARTS BECAUSE OF THIS LACK OF A VENN NUMBER OR SOME WAY TO ASSOCIATE YOU KNOW THE CRIME -- WITH THE ACTIVITY WELL REASONED POINT NOW SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS IT THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT A SECOND THANK YOU FOR ANY OF THE COMMENTS SIR MISTER LUCKY AGAIN NOT TO STATE THE OBVIOUS BUT -- FIRST OF ALL THIS IS AS YOU INDICATED IF YOU'RE A VICTIM OF THIS IT'S DEVASTATING ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING -- THE COST IS HUGELY BURDENSOME I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR LEVEL OF INCOME AS AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING AS THIS COULD TAKE A TRANSPORTATION RIGHT OUT OF THE PICTURE SO THIS A HUGE HUGE PROBLEM I THINK STATEWIDE AND THE LEVEL OF EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS I KNOW THAT THERE'S A TASK FORCE IN MY COMMUNITY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND THEY'RE HAVING MIXED SUCCESS -- SO THIS IS TRULY NEEDED HOWEVER AND AND THEN REASONABLENESS I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED AND I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO -- GET THE BY AND WHEN IT COMES THE FLOOR I'LL PROBABLY HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE SO I I COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR BECAUSE THIS REALLY IS A POWERFUL PROBLEM AND -- I HOPE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET -- SOME REASONABLENESS A LITTLE BETTER REASONABLENESS FOR THE -- RESPONSIBLE A CAR DEALERS -- AS A PARTNER THANK YOU OUR SUMMER THE -- OUR TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- WILL FIRST APPRECIATE YOUR VOTE TODAY DILIGENTLY TO COME TO SOME REASONABLE AGREEMENT ON THOSE DETAILS AND ALSO LIKE COMMITTEE NOTICES IN THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT AREA -- IS A STATEWIDE ISSUE OF CONCERN AS WE'VE HEARD THIS AFTERNOON THIS AFTERNOON DOZEN BILLS INTRODUCED ON

START -- ONLY THING I WOULD SUGGEST LAW ENFORCEMENT ON DEALERS AND EVERYBODY GET TOGETHER ACTUALLY PROBABLY TO TALK TO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THESE THINGS OFTEN FOR MINUTES I DON'T KNOW WHY IT TAKES FOUR HOURS BUT MAYBE IT ALL OF YOU GOT TOGETHER AND TALKED ABOUT HOW TO GET IT OFF SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY CATCH IT IN MATTER EXPERTS AT HOW TO GET THESE THINGS OFF OF OF

S. SUPREME COURT HAS NOTED THAT FACE TO FACE CONFRONTATION ENHANCES THE ACCURACY OF FACT FINDING BY REDUCING THE RISK THAT A WITNESS WILL WRONGFULLY IMPLICATE AN INNOCENT PERSON AND THE COURT HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT THIS RIGHT SHOULD BE LIMITED ONLY IN NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THIS REASON CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT ENACTING LEGISLATION THAT COULD UNDERMINE THE CRIMINAL FACT FINDING PROCESS OR INADVERTENTLY LEAD TO WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS AB SEVENTEEN NINETIES BROAD APPLICATION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THIS PREVIOUS APPROACH I'M THE CURRENT STATUTE EXPLICITLY LIMITS THE USE OF THE PROCEDURE OF CLOSED CIRCUIT ARE TESTIMONY TO CHILDREN WHO ARE THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE OR YOUNGER AND EVEN THEN ONLY IN SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN FACED WITH THE PREVIOUS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE STATUTE TO INCREASE THE AGE TO EVEN FIFTEEN THAT THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY REJECTED THE PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD DREW THE LINE AT THIRTEEN DETERMINING THAT AGE TO BE THE APPROPRIATE AGE AT WHICH TO LIMIT THE STATUTE IN CONTRAST THIS BILL TODAY WOULD EXPAND TO ANY AGE NOTABLY THE LINE OF THIRTEEN APPEARS IN MULTIPLE STATUTES THE STATE HAVING CHOSEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO TREAT CHILDREN DIFFERENTLY AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS SAID FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AND WOULD URGE YOU TO VOTE NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU RT ANYMORE WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM IN OPPOSITION C.

LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOMEONE IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM GOOD MORNING KALRA RON REYES ON BEHALF THE JDC PACIFIC GIVE ALL DEFENDER CENTER AND OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU -- WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR COMMENTS MISTER CORK I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ACLU TESTIFYING FOR THE BILL SAID THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET THIS PROTECTION OF REMOTE TESTIMONY IF THERE'S CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF THAT THE PERSON WOULD BE HARMED READ THE BILL AND IF SO WHY DO YOU OBJECT TO THAT PROVIDING -- IT AS A CASE BY CASE ANALYSIS WHICH OF COURSE IS AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL IS TOO BROAD IN ITS APPLICATION AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WHERE THIS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BEFORE IT HAS BEEN FOR CHILDREN WHO POSE A PARTICULAR VULNERABILITY AND FACED PARTICULAR HARMS AND HAVING TO TESTIFY IN PERSON THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT THAN THESE PREVIOUS APPROACHES AND THAT IT WOULD EXPAND THIS PROCEDURE TO PEOPLE OF ANY AGE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID THERE IS CONCERN THAT THIS WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO ADDITIONAL EXPANSIONS WHEN THIS IS A RIGHT THAT HAS BEEN VERY CAREFULLY AND CAUTIOUSLY LIMITED BY THE COURTS AND BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST -- WELL I WELL TWO THINGS ONE IS YEAH CLEARLY THE CASE FOR CHILDREN IS DIFFERENT I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IF THERE'S CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THE WITNESS WOULD BE HARMED ALLOW THEM TO TESTIFY REMOTELY UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO -- THE CRIMINAL PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR WITNESSES IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR SURVIVORS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR DEFENDANTS AND NOT AS PART OF THE NATURE OF OUR EXISTING CRIMINAL SYSTEM -- AND WE CANNOT SEEK TO A ROAD THIS ESTABLISHED SYSTEM -- WHEN SURVIVORS FACE HARM BY HAVING TO TESTIFY AND IT'S AGAIN NOT TO DIMINISH THAT HARM NOT TO DISRESPECT THE EXPERIENCE OF SURVIVORS BUT THE RIGHTS OF DEFENDANTS AND THIS LONG ESTABLISHED RIGHT TO CONFRONTATION OF ONE'S ACCUSERS -- OUTWEIGHS THOSE -- THOSE HARMS SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WILDER'S -- NEEDS TO BE CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE YOUR FEELING IS THAT THIS WOULD REDUCE WELL AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT IT WHICH PROBABLY SPREAD TO OTHER THINGS BESIDES THIS BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT MOST WITNESSES -- ARE SHAKEN BY THE PROCESS AND SO YOU COULD END UP WITH MOST WITNESSES TESTIFIED REMOTELY IS THAT THE CONCERN MOST WITNESSES ARE ARE SHAKEN BUT WE NEED WE DO KNOW THAT THAT TESTIFYING EVEN TESTIFYING IN COMMITTEE CAN BE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT A DIFFICULT -- EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE AND YET OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM IS IS BUILT ON THIS NOTION OF CONFRONTATION -- EVEN WHEN IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE EVEN WHEN IT IS HARMFUL -- AND WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONS IT HAS BEEN LIMITED TO CHILDREN -- WHO ARE AS WE ALL RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND VULNERABLE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER BONTA I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR THIS BILL I KNOW THAT IN THIS SPEND AT CHALLENGING I MY SENSE IS THAT NARROWLY DEFINED -- AS IT RELATES TO PRO PER DEFENDANTS THERE HAS TO BE CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE AND -- THE VERY NATURE OF THE OF THE EDUCATE OF OF THE CRIME THAT'S BEING ADJUDICATED HAS TO DO WITH BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WITNESS -- I THINK IT'S IRONIC QUITE FRANKLY THAT WE'RE HEARING THIS IN COMMITTEE AT THE WEEK OF OF THIS WEEK OF SEXUAL LIKE LOOKING RECOGNIZING THEM SEXUAL ASSAULT AND AND DENIM DAY LIKE THE FACT THAT IS SO VERY NARROWLY TAILORED MATTERS TO ME I DO THINK THAT A TECHNOLOGY AND COVE IT HAS SHOWN US THAT AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE ENGAGED IN FACT FINDING QUITE QUITE ADMIRABLY AND -- WITH THE SKILL OVER THE COURSE OF OF CODE USING THE TECHNOLOGY REMOTE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO DO SELL -- AND I DO HAVE A CONCERN AS WE ALL SHOULD ABOUT THE SIXTH AMENDMENT -- AND THE CONFRONTATION CLAUSE TO I THINK THE CASE FIVE DEMONSTRATES AND KIND OF SHOWS THAT THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS OF THAT ONE AROUND FACE TO FACE -- INNER AT BEING ABLE TO CONFRONT FOR A FACE TO FACE AND THE OTHER AROUND CROSS EXAMINATION AND IS AN ALLOWANCE WITH REMOTE TO STILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT -- THAT'S AT EXPERIENCE OF FACE TO FACE EVEN THOUGH IT IS REMOTE -- AS WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THROUGHOUT FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I WANTED TO ADD THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD SOMETHING THAT I THINK QUITE HONESTLY WILL BE SOMETHING THAT THE COURTS WILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND -- AND WE WILL LEARN MORE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT I DO THINK THAT IT'S A VALUABLE FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO PASS IT THROUGH TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR BROADER IF YOU COMMENTS CHRISTINE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION I DO WANT TO DISCLOSE BY STATING IN A WHILE THE CONFRONTATION CLAUSE MANIFEST A PREFERENCE FOR FACE TO FACE CONFRONTATION IT IS A PREFERENCE I MUST OCCASIONALLY GIVE WAY TO CONSIDERATION A PUBLIC POLICY THE NECESSITIES OF THE CASE AND THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THE COMPETITION CLASSES NOT PROVIDE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO FACE TO FACE CONFRONTATION AGAIN THE QUESTION THAT WE ARE POSING TODAY TO THIS COMMITTEE THIS PROTECTING SURVIVORS ARE CRIMINAL STOCKADE AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY INTEREST IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE SECOND WHAT ELSE ONE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FOR ITS SUPPORT DISCUSSION OF FOR FOR FOR FOR THE CHAIR FOR ME DISCUSSION ABOUT ABOUT JUDGES AND IT DOES SAY THAT JUDGES UNDER'S EVIDENCE CODE TEXAS SEVEN SIX FIVE HAVE CAN EXERCISE CONTROL OVER INTERROGATION OF WITNESSES TO PROTECT THEM FROM UNDUE HARASSMENT OR EMBARRASSMENT I I GET THE FEELING THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S DON'T BELIEVE THE JUDGES WILL PROTECT VICTIMS AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT'S A LITTLE DISCONCERTING FOR ME THE JUDGES AREN'T EXERCISING PEOPLE FROM BEING STALKING BEING STOCKED DIDN'T THAT DO WE NEED TO GET TO THE CORE OF THAT AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE NEED TO GET TO THE COURT THAT OPENS IT UP SO THAT D. A.'S CAN NOW USE THIS -- FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND I'M NOT REALLY REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH GIVING THEM THAT KIND OF LATITUDE ALMOST OPENING IT UP TO THREE STRIKES KIND OF -- UNDERSTANDING THAT IF SOMEBODY'S AT HARM THAT WE JUST NEED TO GO TO ZERO TO SIXTY IMMEDIATELY JUDGES ARE THERE TO HELP PROTECT TO WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE IF YOU HAD SAID WE WOULD NOT BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE OF MANDATORY MINIMUMS THREE STRIKES -- JUDGES WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY VERY VERY HARSH BUT NOT ONLY ON STOCKERS BUT -- ALLEGED STALKERS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLY HARSH ON THEM AND THEY WOULD HAVE PROTECTED -- WITNESSES IN WAYS THAT -- THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW THAT WE WE WANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM BEING STOCKED -- WHETHER IT'S DENIM WE COULD NOT WE SHOULD ALWAYS WE SHOULD ALWAYS PROTECT PEOPLE FROM FROM BEING STOCKED WAY AND WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY'RE DIRT EVIDENTLY THE DA'S FONG I THINK THERE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT'S FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS THAT THAT THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE ARE BEING PROTECTED IN COURT EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS THAT IT IS AND IF IT ISN'T THEN WE NEED TO GET TO THE CORE OF IT WHICH IS WHAT OUR JUDGES NOT DOING TO ULTIMATELY HELP ON AB SEVENTEEN NINETY BASS A MEMBER CERVANTES THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY LACKEY HI BONTA BONTA HI BRIAN BRIAN HI CORK WORK NO SANTIAGO SEYARTO C.

THE DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT WILL ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIMES WHETHER THEIR DRUG ADDICTION MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES POVERTY WE WANT THESE COLLABORATIVE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS TO WORK THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOUR DRAWING ON MY EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS IS THAT CURRENTLY WITH CRIMES NOT ONLY BEING TREATED CHARGED AS MISDEMEANORS BUT THEY'RE ROUTINELY CITED AND RELEASED WITH -- NO CONSEQUENCES THE CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS HAVE NO INCENTIVE THEY HAVE NO REASON TO PARTICIPATE IN DIVERSION PROGRAMS I KNOW AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR AND AS A FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER THAT THE COMMON PRACTICE INCOME RECORDS WHEN YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF DIVERSION IS FOR THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO ADVISE THEIR CLIENT JUST TAKE THE DEAL JUST DO THE TIME BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WENT BE SETTING UP THEY WENT BE SETTING UP THEIR CLIENT FOR THESE OFTEN YOU KNOW ONEROUS TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE A BALANCE WITH REPEAT RETELL OFFENDERS TO ALLOW FOR THE AGGREGATION OF THE REPEAT FAFF TO TREAT REPEAT THEFT OFFENDERS AS SERIOUS CRIMES BUT NOT TO INCARCERATE THEM TWO BUT TO GIVE THEM THE OPTION OF THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT JOB TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED WITH HERE -- THE IDEA TO SUPPLY TEST FUND SUPPORTERS BILL -- IS STEVE MCCARTHY WITH THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS

SIDES OF THESE ISSUES AND WITH THE BENEFIT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WE DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE IT'S A BALANCED APPROACH TO RESTORING ENFORCEMENT OF SERIAL THEFT LIKEWISE THIS BILL CREATES SEEKS TO CREATE A MEANINGFUL OFFRAMP FOR INDIVIDUALS CHARGED THROUGH A FELONY THEFT DIVERSION PROGRAM OUR GOAL IS THE SOMEONE STATED IS NOT TO PUT MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL BUT CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT AT OUR STORES INTO INCENTIVIZE SERIAL THIEVES TO ACCEPT PRE TRIAL DIVERSION FORTUNATELY IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AUTHORITIES ARE SIMPLY CITING AND RELEASING MISDEMEANOR SUSPECTS WITH LIMITED PROSPECTS FOR REAL CONSEQUENCES THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE PERCEPTION OF THOSE WHO COMMIT THESE STUFFS ACCORDING TO A RECENT SURVEY BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR SHOPLIFTING PREVENTION JUST SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR THEFT EDUCATION COURSES BELIEVE THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED IF CAUGHT STEALING AGAIN VERSUS EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT NATIONWIDE THE DIVERSION ELEMENT OF THIS BILL IS ESSENTIAL WE WANT DIVERSION TO BE REAL AND EFFECTIVE AND AS RETAILERS WE ARE WILLING TO BE PART OF THAT EFFORT YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE NEXT WITNESS ABOUT HOW RETAILERS SPONSORED TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE

MEMBERS MY NAME IS MATTHEW EASILY WITH CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT PREVIOUSLY HAVING SUBMITTED A LETTER WE ARE A VERY LATE EDITION TO SUPPORT -- AND THERE ARE WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS STILL TO BE WORKED OUT IN THE BILL BUT WE ALSO THINK THERE'S REALLY A LOT TO LIKE HERE AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THIS BILL CAN OFFER IS LONG PAST TIME THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TOOK A HARD LOOK AT HOW IT DELIVERS REHABILITATIVE AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS CDC ARE CURRENTLY OFFERS A LARGE ASSORTMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT THEY'RE LACKING IN SEVERAL KEY FACTORS THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL PROGRAMS CURRENTLY OFFERED LACK CLEAR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND THE STATE DOES NOT SEEM TO SUFFICIENTLY EVALUATE WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS OUR SUCCESSES THIS ONLY LEADS TO THE CONTINUATION OF NEARLY EVERY NEW PROGRAM ENDLESSLY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS WORKING THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSED PILOT PROGRAM LENDS ITSELF TO BE RE EVALUATED BECAUSE IT'S TARGETED AT DELIVERING REAL CHANGE AND REDUCTION IN RECIDIVISM AND NOT JUST ANOTHER PROGRAM FOR THE SAKE OF COUNTING PARTICIPANTS EXISTING VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS OFTEN HAVE NO CORRELATION TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES TO WHICH THE INMATES ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED THIS RESULTS IN A SUBSTANTIAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY WHEN UPON RELEASE THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT THIS OFTEN LEADS TO THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED TO TURN BACK TO CRIME WHEN THEY HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS TO IDENTIFY THE NEEDS TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND POTENTIAL POSITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT THE SETTING IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION FOR THOSE WILLING TO FOLLOW THE RULES AND MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES AND COMMITMENTS THEY NEED TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION EVEN WITH THE APPROPRIATE MOTIVATIONS AND INTENTIONS THE PRESSURES FOUND FROM FELLOW INMATES CAN BE OFTEN TO GREAT TO KEEP THIS TO THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW PRISON POLITICS CAN OFTEN BE INESCAPABLE ONE PROGRAMS IN HOUSING OR DELIVERED IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AS THOSE WHO HAVE NO INTENTION OF IMPROVING THEMSELVES IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT REGARDLESS OF THE ENVIRONMENT ACCOUNTABILITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY PROGRAM DELIVERED IN PRISON THERE NEEDS TO BE THE CONTACT THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO FOLLOW THE RULES AND ANYONE WHO CHOOSES TO BE DISRUPTIVE CHALLENGING VIOLENT OR THREATENING SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PROGRAM FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYONE ELSE'S SUCCESS THE CCPOA LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE REQUEST

THANK YOU DAHLE WORLD BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER BRIAN I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I HAVE A LOVE ONE WHO'S SPENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED DAYS AND GEORGE BAILEY DETENTION CENTER IN SAN DIEGO I VISITED THERE MANY TIMES -- HER A LOT OF STORIES -- I THINK RECENT AUDITS HAVE REVEALED EVEN MORE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED ON AND SO YOUR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE COALITION OF OTHER SAN DIEGO LEGISLATORS COMING TOGETHER TO TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES -- GIVES ME A LOT OF HOPE AND I'M GREAT FOR THE BROUGHT THIS TO THIS COMMITTEE TODAY THE BILL SAID THAT YOU MAY CLOSE WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMITTEE AYE THERE IS DEFINITELY A CRISIS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE DYING BEHIND BARS A JAIL SENTENCE CANNOT BE A DEATH SENTENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THESE PEOPLE IN CUSTODY OR SOMEONE'S MOTHER FATHER SISTER BROTHER DAUGHTER SON AB TWENTY THREE FORTY THREE WILL BRING ABOUT THE NECESSARY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENSURE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS LAID OUT BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR ARE IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE SUICIDES AND ENSURE THAT THOSE IN CUSTODY IS ARE IN SAFE AND HUMANE CONDITIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SHARES RECOMMENDING I'VE CALLED CALDERON ON AB TWENTY THREE FORTY THREE BY SEVEN MEMBER WEBER THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AND THEIR IRAQI PLAQUENIL BONTA HI BONTA HI BRIAN BRIAN HI CORK SANTIAGO SAN DIEGO I SEE OUR TO SEE ACTONEL IT MEASURES ARE CALLED NEEDS ONE MORE MR SANTIAGO THANK FAMOUS TRIBE MUCH APPRECIATE THE THE TIME GIVEN TO US TO PRESENT ON THIS -- AB TWENTY SIX PRESUMPTION THAT WHEN A JUVENILE COURT TERM EDUCATION THAT MEANS WE'LL NO LONGER JUVENILE AND FULFILL THE RESPONSIBILITIES EDUCATE TO THEM BY A JUVENILE COURT A JUDGE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISMISS THE PERSON'S JUVENILE RECORD LESS THAT DISMISSAL I WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY FROM THE SAY THAT AGAIN THE THE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION IN A LESS THAT AND UNLESS THAT WE TAKE THIS OFF TO BE A LITTLE BIT CLEARSIDE PODESTA FOLKS NOW I'M SEEING FROM HEADS LOOKING AT ME SOMEONE MAKE SURE OF THE CLEAR I APOLOGIZE -- IT UNLESS THAT UNLESS THAT DISMISSAL WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY OR THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE NOW SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE SAY WELL WHAT IF THIS PERSON GOES DOES THAT'S WHAT THIS PERSON BECOMES A THREAT UNLESS THAT DISMISSAL WOULD ENDANGER THE PUBLIC SAFETY THIRTY VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A JUVENILE ADJUDICATION -- AND A CONVICTION THAT HAPPENS -- WHEN A PERSON IS AN ADULT THAT MEANS EIGHTEEN OR OVER BECAUSE A JUVENILE ADJUDICATION IS IS I'VE COME TO LEARN OVER THE YEARS -- IT IS WHEN IT IS WHEN THEY DO IT ALL GOES BEFORE COURT THERE'S NO A JURY OF THEIR PEERS -- DID YOU KNOW SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE REHABILITATIVE BUT WHEN A JUVENILE GOES BEFORE A COURT THE COURT IN MY MIND IN MANY CASES DETERMINE THE JUVENILES DONE SOMETHING BECAUSE IT THE BURDEN RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DEVELOP THAT SAID -- THERE IS NO REHABILITATIVE PROCESS I WANT TO STATE THAT BECAUSE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IN ADULT COURT ADULT COURT -- IS IS IT WENT WHEN A PERSON GOES TO TRIAL IT IS BEFORE THE COURT IN IT IS DETERMINED BY IT BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS SO AGENTS SO A PERSON HAS THE ABILITY TO PRESENT INFORMATION AND MAKE THE CASE TO A JURY OF THEIR PEERS NOW WE MAY HAVE A DETAILS OPTICAL DIFFERENCES ON HOW WE VIEW THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THOSE ARE FACTS WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WHEN A INDIVIDUAL -- IN AND AND IS PRODUCTIVE AND I'M A STATE AGAIN IS NO LONGER A DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY THE DATA JUDY CATION COULD BE -- COULD BE REMOVED AND AND THAT GOES A LONG WAYS -- IT ALLOWS A PERSON TO POTENTIALLY LIST IN THE ARMY GAIN -- AND EMPLOYMENT -- OUT OF STATE OR FACILITIES THAT REQUIRE A FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECKS OR SECURE OPC -- OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES NOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED WELL YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEAL A RECORD TO THE CEILING THE RECORD ONLY APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU WERE TO SEAL A RECORD -- YOU YOU COULD STILL GO TO SAY NEVADA AND HAVE THIS -- SHOW UP -- BUT I WE THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE ABILITY TO CLEAN ONE'S RECORDS IF THEY A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE GRANTED THEM BECAUSE THEY WANTED BECAUSE WE WANT THAT PERSON TO LIVE ITS LIFE -- -- FULFILLED AND IN HAVING THAT THE COURT -- THAT CASE AGAINST THEM WHEN THEY WERE A JUVENILE HAS HUGE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS I WANTED I WANT TO SAY THAT IF IT IF THE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION AND WE DON'T TAKE THAT AWAY IF IT ENDANGERS THE PUBLIC SAFETY PHONE TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE FOR FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THAT FROM ANTI RACISM COALITION AND JONATHAN LAVA FROM THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER THANK YOU I THINK I POINTED THE WRONG DIRECTION WHEN I DID THAT SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS YOU LOOKING DOWN GET THE NAMES RIGHT THANK MISTER GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MIGUEL I HAS GOT SCEA I'M A YOU'VE JUST A SPECIALIST WITH ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND A CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE TEEN I BECAME A WARD OF THE COURT OF CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT TIME IN CáC IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE A WHILE AT THESE INSTITUTIONS I WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT OF MY ACTIONS MADE UPON MY COMMUNITY AND MY FAMILY FURTHERMORE WHILE I WAS INCARCERATED I TOOK MANY VOCATIONAL AND COLLEGE COURSES TO PREPARE ME AS A TRANSITION HOME IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN SINCE MY RELEASE I'VE OBTAINED THREE ASSOCIATE DEGREES AND A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM UC RIVERSIDE AND I BECAME A FATHER TO TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS NOW A BRAND NEW HOMEOWNER MOST RECENTLY I WAS APPOINTED AS A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS BE SEC THAT BEING SAID MY REENTRY WITH CHALLENGING HOWEVER IT DID NOT COMPARE TO THE DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH MY JUVENILE RECORD BEING ASSESSABLE TO EMPLOYERS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES ESPECIALLY THOSE OUT OF STATE I HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL AND MAKE MULTIPLE SITUATIONS ABOUT WHETHER I SHOULD ANSWER YES OR NO -- TWO QUESTIONS CONCERNING MY JUVENILE BACKGROUND EVEN THOUGH I HAVE DEMONSTRATED MY RESILIENCE AND ABILITY TO SUCCEED AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO NAVIGATE MY TRANSITION INTO ADULTHOOD CURRENTLY EXISTING RECORD SETTING LAWS ARE LIMITED TO THE RELIEF THEY PROVIDE TO INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS MYSELF AND PRESENT CHALLENGES AROUND REENTRY FURTHERMORE THE CEILING AND REALLY FLIES RELIEF LAWS ONLY APPLY TO CALIFORNIA AGENCIES AND DO NOT EXTEND TO FEDERAL AGENCIES OR OTHER STATES AS A RESULT I AM LIMITED TO THE OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SUCH AS LAW SCHOOLS AND OTHER GOOD PAYING JOBS REQUIRING STRINGENT FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY NINE WILL HELP ALLEVIATE THESE LIMITATIONS ALLOW ME TO EXPLORE BETTER EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY AND COMMUNITY FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE I URGE THE COMMITTEE FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S JOHN OF THE LAW BUT I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER WHICH IS THE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY NINE WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION AND FRESH LIFELINES FOR YOUTH OR SPONSOR PARTNERSHIP IS BASED ON THE IDEA THE YOUTH EXITING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM DESERVE A CHANCE TO FULLY SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT BY HELPING TO FACILITATE THE DISMISSAL OF JUVENILE COURT PETITIONS WHEN YOU FOR EXITING PROBATION THIS BILL WILL ALLOW JUSTICE IMPACTED YOUTH TO FULLY ACCESS FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY UNDER CURRENT LAW EVEN IF THE YOUTHS RECORDS HAVE BEEN SEALED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES THAT REMAIN JUVENILE ADJUDICATIONS MAY HARM A NON CITIZEN CALIFORNIA YOUTH WHO IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE LAWFUL IMMIGRATION STATUS LIKE DR GOOGLE EDUCATIONS ARE A BARRIER TO ENTERING THE MILITARY AND OBTAINING FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT YOUTH APPLYING TO JOBS OR EMPLOYMENT LICENSES IN OTHER STATES FACE BARRIERS BECAUSE OTHER STATES MAY NOT FULLY RECOGNIZE CALIFORNIA RECORD SEALING A DISMISSAL PROVIDES THE STRONGEST PROTECTION AGAINST COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY NINE CREATES A PRESUMPTION THE JUVENILE ADJUDICATION SHOULD BE DISMISSED WHEN A YOUTH EXITS PROBATION UNLESS DISMISSAL OF THE PETITION IT WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY THE DEFINITION OF ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY IS EXACTLY THE DEFINITION THAT THE LEGISLATURE JUST ADOPTED LAST YEAR WHEN IT ENACTED SENATE BILL EIGHTY ONE WHICH AMENDED THE ADULT JUVENILE STATURE IF A JUVENILE JUDGE DETERMINES THAT DISMISSAL IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC SAFETY THE PRESUMPTION WILL NOT APPLY THE JUDGE WILL NOT DISMISS THE CASE AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY NINE ALSO PROVIDES IMPORTANT GUIDANCE TO JUDGES ABOUT HOW TO EXERCISE THE DISCRETION TO DISMISS A JUVENILE PETITION IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED THE ADULT DISMISSAL STATUTE LAST YEAR IS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THAT GIVING GUIDANCE TO JUDGES HOPES TO REDUCE THE VERY PROFOUND DISCREPANCIES AND DISPARITIES IN JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING THAT OCCUR FROM JUDGE TO JUDGE AND FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY NINE ACCOMPLISHES THIS VERY SAME GOAL FOR JUVENILE COURT WE HOPE THESE PRINCIPLES WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.
