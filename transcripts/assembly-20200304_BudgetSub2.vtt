ME AND THAT'S JUST ONE OTHER

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:01.038
ELEMENT. ANTIQUATED BRING OF.

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:02.806
UNDER ONE UMBRELLA EVEN

TABLE. WOULD WOULD BE WE BETTER

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:12.870
OFF- FLEXING SOME OF THESE

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:14.371
DOLLARS AND YOU LLOWING THEM

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:16.240
TO BE UTILIZED FOR. DISTRICTS

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:18.142
TO DISASTER CORPS NEEDS THE

00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:20.511
YEAH WE SAW. YOU KNOW YOU

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:22.012
WORKED HARD TRYING TO FOCUS ON

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.714
OUR DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:27.184
WHICH IS- FINANCIALLY SHAKY.

00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:29.052
JUST READ RECENTLY THAT OF THE

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.654
SAN DIEGO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.256
OF ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE IN

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:33.957
THAT CERTIFICATION LEVEL WHICH

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:36.160
ARE. ARE FINANCIALLY TROUBLING

00:46:36.226 --> 00:46:38.529
AND SO THAT BEING SAID. YOU

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:40.264
KNOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.399
HAVING ALL OF OUR RESOURCES GO

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.034
TO KEEP DISTRICTS FINANCIALLY.

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:47.171
STABLE OR DO A LITTLE BIT OF

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:49.173
THAT AND TO FOCUS ON OUR- OUR

00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:50.507
CORTINES BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:51.775
TRY TO BE EVERYTHING TO

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:53.544
EVERYBODY. YOU'RE NOTHING TO

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.113
NOBODY SO. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.115
SAY ABOUT THAT MR SPI. I'M A

00:46:58.182 --> 00:46:59.750
BOTH KIND OF PERSON AS WELL AND

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:01.451
I THINK THAT THE LIKE I SAID

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:03.153
THESE ARE NOT. MUTUALLY

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.655
EXCLUSIVE PROPOSITIONS I THINK

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:07.191
THAT WE DO NEED MORE FUNDING

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:09.126
FOR OUR SCHOOLS OVERALL AND I

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:09.927
THINK THAT WE NEED CREATIVE

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:11.862
PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS REALLY

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:14.331
CRITICAL NEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN-

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:15.999
LARGELY NOT. ADDRESS FOR MANY

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:19.102
MANY YEARS PRIOR- I THINK THAT

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.205
YOU AYE I'VE HEARD FROM- SOME

00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:22.606
LEGISLATORS OUTSIDE OF THIS

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:24.308
PARTICULAR CHAMBER WHO ALSO

00:47:24.374 --> 00:47:25.576
SAID OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

00:47:25.642 --> 00:47:28.579
REALLY HURTING. AND NEED HELP

00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:30.681
AND AS IS NO EXTRA MONEY LAYING

00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:32.683
AROUND MY SUGGESTION TO THEM.

00:47:32.749 --> 00:47:33.684
AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.052
COMMITTEE IS THAT WE WORK

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:36.853
CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.089
WE LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS TOGETHER

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.592
THAT WILL MAKE SENSE FOR OUR

00:47:41.658 --> 00:47:43.227
SCHOOL DISTRICTS BOTTOM LINE.

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:47.197
AND WILL MAKE SENSE ON THINGS

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:49.499
THAT REALLY I DON'T THEY ARE.

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:51.902
THE G. I REALLY THAT I GOVERNOR

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:54.438
IS REALLY ALSO WANTING TO DO

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.139
MORE AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:57.374
FIND WAYS TO WORK WITH THE

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:58.709
GOVERNOR ON IDENTIFYING

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:00.711
SOLUTIONS AND STRATEGIES THAT

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:02.112
WILL MEET ALL OF THE NEEDS OF

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:03.480
OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:04.548
ULTIMATELY ARE SIX MILLION

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.817
STUDENTS OKAY THANKS FOR CHAIR

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:07.751
YEAH I JUST WANNA YEAH BUT IF

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:09.286
YOU LOOK AT THIS BUDGET WE'RE

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:10.754
SLIDING BACK INTO THE CATEGORY

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:12.923
CLARA. AND THAT THAT IS

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.226
SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULDN'T

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:17.828
DO I THINK WE SHOULD SET THE

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:21.832
BAR GIVE DISTRICTS THE

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:22.399
RESOURCES IN THROUGH BUT YOU

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:24.301
KNOW NOT WE'RE ALWAYS DOING WE

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:25.535
SEE A HOLDING SOME OF THEM BACK

00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:27.237
SO THEY DON'T. MEAN JUNE

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:28.305
ACHIEVEMENTS THAT SOMETHING

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:32.676
DISCUSS FOR THAT POINT COM. I

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:33.343
CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNOR ON

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.345
THE ISSUE OF CAT. IS BUT AS I.

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:36.747
AS I LOOK AT THE BUDGET THAT

00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:38.315
HE'S PUT FORWARD I SEE IT

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:41.685
VALUING. WHAT ELSE CFF MEANS TO

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:44.054
OUR DISTRICTS I SEE A 12-1 IF

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:45.555
NOT. I'M GONNA DIE I DON'T

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:46.757
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT

00:48:46.823 --> 00:48:47.858
POINT JACK I'M NOT A LOT OF

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:48.959
MONEY SET ASIDE FOR LITTLE

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:50.794
PROJECTS EVERYWHERE YES THAT'S

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:53.397
GREAT. YES BUT THE FACT OF THE

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:55.032
MATTER IS THAT DOES SLICE BACK.

00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:56.733
TOWARDS THE CATEGORY CLARA HAS

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.601
THERE BEEN A CALL FOR

00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:59.102
CATEGORICAL SO I DON'T KNOW

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:00.170
THAT I WOULD SAY THIS GOES

00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:02.906
RIGHT BUDGET AND I WOULD SAY IT.

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:04.107
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WERE SLAIN

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:05.942
BACK IN THAT ERA. GOT IT. YEAH

00:49:06.009 --> 00:49:06.910
IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:08.612
SCHOOLS ARE ALL GOOD IDEAS A

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:11.548
TEACHER. PROGRAMS AND ALL OF

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.916
THOSE ARE IDEAS AND THEY'RE

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.651
NOT. ESSENTIALLY FLEXIBLE ON

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:16.053
EVERYTHING TO US BY DISTRICTS

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.688
WHEN THEY APPLY FOR GRANTS. AS

00:49:17.754 --> 00:49:19.089
YOU KNOW MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:20.157
AND KIDS ARE FROM SMALLER

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:22.426
DISTRICTS AND I DON'T ALWAYS

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:23.060
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.928
FOR THOSE OF. MY FOR JUST TWO

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:26.563
OTHER THOUGHTS NOT A QUESTIONS

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.132
THE COMMENT IS THAT. YEAH WE'RE

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.734
THIRTY NINE. IT'S A DISGRACE

00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:31.935
OUR FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:33.570
COMPARISON THERE STATES. I

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:35.439
AGREE WHAT WE YOUR TASK FORCE

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:37.541
AND- MISTER MARTZ SUED SHE AND

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:40.277
I AND SOME OTHER- ASSEMBLY.

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:42.212
DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING AT THEIR

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:44.114
CSPA PROPOSALS AND FULL AND

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:45.515
FAIR FUNDING AND TALKING ABOUT

00:49:45.582 --> 00:49:46.350
HOW WE CAN BRING THAT BACK

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.218
BECAUSE- THESE ARE JUST

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:50.153
BANDAIDS AND SO WE GET THAT.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.621
AND THEN I KNOW WE'LL GET INTO

00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:53.056
IT BUT I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:54.758
BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF. ON THE

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:56.593
PROPOSAL ON THE REWARD FOR

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.428
EARLY EDUCATION. I HAVEN'T

00:49:58.495 --> 00:49:59.563
TAKEN A POSITION ON IT YET

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:00.897
ANOTHER IS ACTUALLY A TRAILER

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.299
BILL IN A COMPANION BILL

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.333
INTRODUCED AND I THINK THIS

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.702
COULD BE NEEDS TO FULLY. THAT

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:07.170
THE IMPLICATIONS IT'S

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:12.075
INTRIGUING. TO HAVE A SOFT KISS

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:16.680
YOU ADD. YOU THINK. MY TAX.

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:17.781
KIDS ARE FAMILY. AND OUR PER.

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:20.283
AND THAT SHOULD BE. OUR ONLY

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.251
FOCUS ON HOW IT IMPACTS ADULTS

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:23.954
AND BUREAUCRATS YOU KNOW SO BE

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:24.821
IT SO. I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:26.323
TO BE HOW WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.158
GOING FORWARD SO. I WITH THAT

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:29.860
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ONE

00:50:29.926 --> 00:50:31.728
LAST YES- SURE IF I COULD THANK

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:33.764
YOU MISTER CHAIR- ON THE ISSUE

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.132
OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.401
HAVE GRANT WRITERS- THAT IS

00:50:37.467 --> 00:50:38.602
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:39.002
MONITORING WE HAVE

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:40.003
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.271
SMALLEST. AND RULED TRICKS.

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:44.307
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:44.908
DONE THERE ARE WAYS TO CREATE.

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:46.343
AN ESTABLISH. FORMULA THAT

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.578
ALLOW DISTRICTS TO BE SEE

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:50.046
FUNDS. BASED ON ELIGIBILITY

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:51.548
THAT THEY HAVE WHETHER IT'S

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:52.649
FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH OR OTHER

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.951
NEEDS. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:56.086
HAVE HELP REALLY FROM THE

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:58.121
LEGISLATURE. IN MAKING THAT THE

00:50:58.188 --> 00:51:01.057
WAY THAT OUR LEGISLATION IN

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:04.461
EDUCATION. THIS IS AN EX. JUST

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.263
LAST POINT ON THE SHOW ABOUT

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:07.731
THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS ARE IN THE

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:09.900
BUDGET- YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:12.636
SAY THAT. FOR AS MANY DISTRICTS

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.070
THAT HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN.

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:15.872
ABOUT GETTING RID OF THEM AND

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:17.374
JUST FUNDING DISTRICTS BOTTOM

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:19.142
LINE. I WOULD SAY WE PROBABLY

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:20.911
HEARD FROM AS MANY DISTRICTS TO

00:51:20.977 --> 00:51:22.045
SAY. THAT PROGRAMS LIKE

00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:23.413
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ARE VERY

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.248
IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND I WOULD

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:27.250
JUST ASK THAT W- WHAT WE HAVE

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:28.552
TOUGH CHOICES TO MAKE THAT WE

00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:29.820
NOT SAY IT'S ONE OF THE OTHER.

00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:31.655
BUT THAT WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.056
MAXIMIZE WHAT WE HAPPEN TO GET

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.758
MORE OF WHAT WE NEED- AND TO

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.126

TO EMPHASIZE IN THE BUDGET YEAR

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.365
IS THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY

THE EXTENT THAT THE GUARANTEE

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:23.072
IS HIGHER BY MAY IT'S LIKELY

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.340
THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:27.009
LARGER DEPOSITS DEPOSITS TO TE

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.344

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.846
THE STATE WOULD PROBABLY BE

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.814
ABLE TO. LARGER WITHDRAWALS

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:32.782
FROM THE RESERVE IS THERE THE

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:34.283
SOFT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.885
THE BUDGET OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:39.589
MONTHS. I TURNING TO PAGE THREE

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:41.424
OF OUR HAND OUT. WE THINK THE

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.558
GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATES OF GENERAL

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:43.593
FUND ROSE REVENUE ARE

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.394
REASONABLE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:46.829
IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO US IN

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.764
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. A LITTLE BIT

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.366
HIGHER THAN US IN NINETEEN

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.067
TWENTY AND A LITTLE BIT BELOW

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.902
US IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.204
OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD OUR

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:55.705
ESTIMATES ARE VIRTUALLY

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:58.007
IDENTICAL. WE ARE CONTINUING TO

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.509
MONITOR SOME RISKS TO THE STATE

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:00.543
ECONOMY INCLUDING SOME

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.411
SLOWDOWNS IN TRADE ACTIVITY AND

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:04.280
JOB GROWTH. BUT BASED ON WHAT

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:07.617
WE KNOW TODAY WE THINK THE

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:08.184
GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATE OF STATE

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.685
REVENUE AND THE GUARANTEE SEEM

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.454
REASONABLE. THE ADMINISTRATION

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.322
IS ABOVE US ON THEIR PROPERTY

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.892
TAX ESTIMATES ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:16.492
AND SEVENTY MILLION OVER THE

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:17.493
THREE YEAR PERIOD. YOU'LL BE

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.961
HEARING MORE FROM US ABOUT THAT

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:21.097
IN THE COMING DAYS BUT I THINK

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.098
YOU'LL SEE THAT DIFFERENCE I

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.599
KNOW A LITTLE BIT BY THE TIME

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:26.702
WE DO OUR NEXT OUTLOOK IN MAY.

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:28.171
AGAIN ANY CHANGES IN GENERAL

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:29.305
FUND REVENUE OR PROPERTY TAX

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:30.740
ESTIMATES WOULD AFFECT HOW MUCH

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.475
FUNDING IS AVAILABLE IN YOUR

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:33.609
OVERALL PROPOSITION NINETY

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:36.679
EIGHT BUDGET. I TURNING TO PAGE

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:38.814
FOUR- ALL OF THE INCREASES IN

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.283
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED OVER THE

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:41.317
THREE YEAR PERIOD SUPPORT

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:42.451
NEARLY FOUR BILLION IN NEW

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.955
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS YOU THE

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:46.889
ADMINISTRATION INDICATED

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.691
EARLIER THOSE NEW PROPOSALS ARE

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:51.160
DIVIDED ABOUT EVENLY BETWEEN

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:51.627
ONE TIME AND I'M GOING

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:53.930
AUGMENTATIONS. FOR K. TWELVE

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.631
SCHOOLS THE ON GOING FUNDING IS

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:56.732
REALLY A STORY ABOUT THE TWO

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.501
POINT 29% COST OF IT JUST

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:00.369
MEANT. MOST OF THE ONE TIME

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.672
FUNDING AS YOU HEARD IS ABOUT

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:03.272
IMPROVING THE EDUCATION WORK

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:05.074

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.577

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:09.378
PERFORMING SCHOOLS. PAGE FIVE

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:10.846
IS JUST A RUNDOWN OF THIS OF

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.381
THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IT'S

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:13.649
JUST A DIFFERENT SLICE OF THE

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.786
THE ADMINISTRATION SHEET I'LL

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:19.121
COVER EACH OF THOSE PROPOSALS

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:21.224
IN MORE DETAIL LATER THIS YEAR

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.925
TURNING TO PAGE SIX WE THINK

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:24.727
THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET OVERALL

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:26.662
HAS SOME POSITIVE COMPONENTS-

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.197
WE THINK THE MIX OF ONE TIME AN

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.298
ONGOING PROPOSAL SEEMS

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:30.900

SET ASIDE ONE TIME ACTIVITIES

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.070
PROVIDES YOU WITH THE QUESTION

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:34.904
IN CASE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:37.273
DECLINES. IN TAT SCENARIO IT'S

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.008
LESS DISRUPTIVE TO ADJUST THE

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.309
ONE TIME SPENDING AN ONGOING

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:42.979
PROGRAMS LIKE THE LCF. I THINK

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.480
THE BUDGET ALSO WE THINK THE

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.715
BUDGET ALSO WITH DRAWS

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:46.916
ATTENTION TO SOME IMPORTANT

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:48.818
ISSUES IN EDUCATION- MANY

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.586
DISTRICTS FOR EXAMPLE DO

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.121
STRUGGLE WITH ACHIEVEMENT GAPS.

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.656
AND MANY DISTRICTS TO REPORT

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.058
HAVEN'T DIFFICULTY FINDING

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:56.626
TEACHERS IN CERTAIN SUBJECT

01:04:56.692 --> 01:05:00.630
AREAS TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN WE%

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:02.398
HAVE TWO MAIN CONCERNS TO

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:04.100
DROUGHT YOUR ATTENTION- FIRST

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.268
WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:06.636
PROPOSALSARE UNLIKELY TO

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:08.838
ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:09.438
PROBLEMS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:10.973
CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT WE THINK

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.308
MANY OF THE PROPOSALS WOULD NOT

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.509
ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:14.677
EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.513
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND- ENHANCE

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.482
THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE. MANY

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:20.983
OF THE PROPOSALS ALSO HAVE

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.084
LITTLE DETAIL ABOUT HOW THE

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:23.686
FUNDS TO BE SPENT WHICH MAKES

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.921
IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ASSESS

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:27.757
HOW EFFECTIVE THEY MIGHT BE.

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.158
SECONDLY WE'RE CONCERNED THAT

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:30.793
THE BUDGET DOES NOT PROVIDE

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.061
MUCH FISCALLY FOR SCHOOL

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:34.030
DISTRICTS. I DISTRICTS ARE

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.131
FACING COST PRESSURE FROM

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.732
VARIOUS SOURCES- PRIMARILY

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.601
HIGHER PENSION COSTS AND HIGHER

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.703
COSTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.671
ARE THE BUDGET DOES PROVIDE A

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.472
COLA- BUT GIVEN SOME OF THOSE

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:46.175
OTHER PRESSURES. WE THINK MOST

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:46.709
DISTRICTS HAVE AT. TIGHT

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:52.081
BUDGETS NEXT YEAR. TURNING TO

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.582
PAGE EIGHT AND OUR

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:54.784
RECOMMENDATIONS WE RECOMMEND

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.585
YOU CONTINUE TO RELY UPON A MIX

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:57.420
OF ONE TIME AND I'M GOING

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:59.422
SPENDING. DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:00.690
HAVE TO BE THE EXACT SAME AS

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:03.225
WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES BUT

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:03.793
WE THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS A

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:05.461
REASONABLE STARTING POINT. I

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.163
WOULD RECOMMEND FUNDING A FEW

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:07.930
OF THE GOVERNOR'S ONE TIME

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.498
PROPOSALS. FOCUSING

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:10.900
SPECIFICALLY ON THE PROPOSALS

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.034
THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:13.969
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS. AND HAVE

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.204
CLEAR OBJECTIVES AND SPENDING

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.239
REQUIREMENTS. WE RECOMMEND YOU

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:18.474
REJECT MOST OF THE OTHER ONE

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.176
TIME INITIATIVES- WHICH WULD

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.478
FREE UP ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.246
FOR OTHER EDUCATION PRIORITIES.

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:26.082
I FINALLY WE RECOMMEND USING

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.283
THE BULK OF THAT ONE TIME

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.919
FUNDING TO PROVIDE FISCALLY FIT

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.420
TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE THINK

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.521
THAT OF ALL THE OPTIONS ON THE

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.423
TABLE. AND HELPING A PROVIDING

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.425
ADDITIONAL PAYMENT TO ADDRESS

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:37.093
DISTRICTS UNFUNDED PENSION

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.295
LIABILITIES- IS THE MOST

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.030
PROMISING OPTION. THAT APPROACH

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.765
WOULD BOTH IMPROVE THE FISCAL

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.467
HEALTH OF THE PENSION SYSTEMS.

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:45.768
AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.970
REDUCE DISTRICT COST ON A LONG

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:50.172
TERM BASIS. IN ADDITION TO

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.407
PAYING DOWN LIABILITIES WE

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:52.541
THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER USING

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:53.609
A PORTION OF THAT PENSION

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:54.977
FUNDING TO REDUCE DISTRICT

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:57.146
DISTRICT COST PACIFIC LEE AND

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.280
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. RIGHT NOW

01:06:58.347 --> 01:06:59.515
DISTRICT PENSION RATES ARE

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:01.283
SCHEDULED TO INCREASE NEXT YEAR

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:02.918
ANDTHEN DROP SLIGHTLY THE YEAR

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:04.720
AFTER THAT. THE LEGISLATURE

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:06.288
COULD USE AROUND THREE HUNDRED

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.089
MILLION TO SOME WITHOUT THOSE

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:10.059
PENSION RATE INCREASES AT OUT.

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.861
ELIMINATE THAT HUMP AND LLOW-

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:12.862
PENSION COSTS TO GROW MORE

01:07:12.928 --> 01:07:14.630
SLOWLY AND STEADILY OVER THE

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.899
NEXT FEW YEARS. THAT'S REALLY

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:17.967
ARE TAKEN THE PROPOSITION AND

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:19.702
GET BUDGET AND IN A NUTSHELL

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:20.770
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUE TALK A

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:22.805
LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR REACTION

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:23.272
TO THE EARLY EDUCATION

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:27.076
PROPOSALS. US AIR CORTEZ WITH

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:28.043

PROPOSALS AND SINCE THE

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:34.383
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.918
DESCRIBED FEES- WE'LL JUST MOVE

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:38.187
ALONG TO PAGE TEN. WHICH LISTS

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:39.321
ARE ASSESSMENT INTO

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:41.123
RECOMMENDATIONS A BRIEF SUMMARY

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.459
OF OUR SUSSMAN RECOMMENDATIONS-

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:44.560
WITH REGARD TO THE STATE

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.295
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ON THE

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:47.496
GOVERNOR PER PROPOSES TO

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:48.664
PROVIDE TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.299
STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS AND WE

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:52.001
THINK THE PROGRAMS UNLIKELY TO

01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:52.968
ACCOMMODATE. THIS IT TO THE

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:55.738
SICK- ALL OF EXPANSION I'M IN

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.072
THIS IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE MORE

01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:58.040
OF THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE

01:07:58.107 --> 01:07:59.842
SLOTS AVAILABLE MADE AVAILABLE

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.444
IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WILL

GO AND USE AND WILL BE

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.646
AVAILABLE TO ALLOCATE IN THE

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.514
BUDGET YEAR. I'M SO WE THINK

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.215
IT'S ARE RECOMMENDING A MORE

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:07.716

SAME QUESTIONS I ADDRESS TO THE

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:18.140
SUPERINTENDENT THAT IS THAT. IN

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:21.210
THIS TIME WHEN- MEASURE SCHOOL

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:23.646
DISTRICTS ARE- TALKING ABOUT

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:26.081
NOT BEING ABLE TO- MADE THEIR

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:28.951
EXISTING COSTS LIKE LAUSD

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:31.020
OAKLAND IN SACRAMENTO- AMONG

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.022
MANY OTHERS- IN THESE GOOD

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:36.058
BUDGET TIMES ARE WHY ARE WE

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.094
TALKING ABOUT. CREATING NEW

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:39.962
PROGRAMS RATHER THAN FOCUSING

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.498
ON HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:44.433
WITH THEIR EXISTING COSTS SO

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.535
THERE IS NOT ANY CREATION OF A

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:47.936
NEW PROGRAMS WITH THE ON GOING

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.672
FUNDS ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:51.340
YOU SEE ARE ONE TIME PROGRAMS

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:52.608
WITH ONE TIME FUN AND THEY'RE

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:53.842
TARGETED. INTENSIVE

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.811
INTERVENTION AND WHAT WE ALSO

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:57.813
HEAR FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.814
WENT OUT ON IN OUR SPECIAL

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:00.783
EDUCATION REFORM EFFORTS THIS

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:01.917
YEAR AND WE SPOKE TO A LOT OF

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:02.885
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEIR

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.720
NUMBER ONE CONCERNON IS REALLY

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.955
TEACHER RETENTION- MENTAL

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:10.859
HEALTH ISSUES- BUT ALSO. YOU

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:11.560
KNOW JUST GO TO CLOSING THE

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:13.562
ACHIEVEMENT GAP UNBEATABLE TO

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.596
EDUCATE THE STUDENTS IN THEIR

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:16.031
CLASSROOM SO WE WERE TRYING TO

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.900
ADDRESS A LOT OF THOSE. ISSUES

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.635
IN THIS PART MORE TARGETED

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:21.370
INTERVENTIONS AND WE USE THE

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.105
ONE TIME FUNNY BECAUSE AGAIN-

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.807
AS THE LA POINTED OUT THOSE ARE

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:26.508
THINGS THAT. IF THE GUARANTEE

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.544
DROPS REVENUES DROP THOSE CAN

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.747
BE REDUCED- AND THE NEXT YEAR'S

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:36.051
BUDGET. IS THAT THE ENTIRE

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:38.787
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:39.254
DESIGNED TO CLOSE THE

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:44.126
ACHIEVEMENT GAP. I THINK WHAT

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.327
WE'RE FINDING IS THAT IN SOME

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:47.629
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH DEEP YES

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.665
IT SHOULD- BUT WERE FINING AS

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:50.833
AT THAT OVER THE EIGHT YEARS OF

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.067
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING PLAN

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.435
THAT WE STILL HAVE POCKETS OF

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:55.237
DEEP POVERTY AND IN THOSE DEEP

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.538
ALREADY WERE SEEN DISTRICTS

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.307
THAT ARE. I'M SHOWING THIS

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:01.510
PERSISTENT- ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:04.046
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THIS THEY-

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:04.613
COMMUNITY SCHOOL OPPORTUNITY

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.181
GRANT IS REALLY RECOGNIZING

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:08.684
THAT A CHILD EDUCATION IS NOT

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:09.418
ONLY IN THE CLASSROOM BUT IT'S

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:10.619
ALL OF THE OTHER SUPPORT AND

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:11.754
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED IN

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.589
ORDER TO ACCESS EDUCATION WHEN

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:14.823
THEY ARE IN THE CLASSROOM. SO

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.592
THESE PROP THESE PROPOSALS ARE

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:18.160
NOT RIGHT NOW OR THAT TYPE OF

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.428
RAP SERVICES NOT READILY

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:21.396
AVAILABLE IN THE CLASSROOM SO

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:22.598
SOMEBODY'S TARGET INTERVENTIONS

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:24.933
ARE TRY REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.335
WE NEED TO GET INTO THE

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:29.104
CLASSROOM IT AIDS SCHOOL

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:29.738
DISTRICTS AND UNDERSTANDING HOW

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:32.674
TO GET SERVICES TO STUDENTS AND

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.409
HOW. WELL HOPEFULLY. BE

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:36.278
DECREASED ACHIEVEMENT. WE'VE

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:37.012
HAD EIGHT YEARS OF LOCAL

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:39.748
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. TO

01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:40.549
ATTEMPT TO CLOSE THE

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.451
ACHIEVEMENT GAP. HOW WOULD YOU

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.452
CHARACTERIZE THE PROGRESS WE'VE

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:45.320
MADE. IN TRUMP I WOULD SAY THE

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.488
SO WE'VE MADE GREAT WE HAVE

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.724
MADE PROGRESS IN MANY AREAS AND

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:49.591
WE ARE SEEN ACHIEVEMENT GAPS

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:50.192
GROWS BUT WE JUST HAVE SOME

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.994
PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.295
THOSE ARE WAS STUDENTS THAT

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:57.266
HAVE- A LOT OF. DO THEY NEED

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:57.833
THEY NEED MORE SERVICES AND

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.802
SUPPORTS. WE NEED TO GIVE THEM

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:04.940
MORE MONEY. I DON'T KNOW THE

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.341
GIVING MORE MONEY IS THE ISSUE

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:07.142
I THINK A LOT OF SCHOOL

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.310
DISTRICTS MEDIATE ADDITIONAL

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:10.512
STATE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:14.183
WITH. THAT IS MORE TARGETED.

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:15.851
THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:18.754
CAPACITY TO PROVIDE THOSE

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:20.589
SERVICES AT THIS POINT. CITY IN

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:24.393
SUPPORT IS MORE MNEY. TARGETED

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:27.429
TARGETED OKAY- WHAT WHAT IS

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:31.300
YOUR- RESPONSE TO THE LA OWES-

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:33.435
RECOMMENDATION THAT TO. THE

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.604
LEGISLATURE REJECT MOST OF THE-

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.439
ONE TIME- INITIATIVES OF THE

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:38.240
GOVERNMENT'S ONE TIME

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.676
INITIATIVES TO FREE UP MORE

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:43.445
THAN A BILLION DOLLARS TO HELP

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:45.647
DISTRICTS WITH ONE TIME A

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:46.648
RELIEF TO PAY DOWN PENSION

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:48.684
LIABILITIES. WE WERE VERY

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:52.087
DISAPPOINTED EIGHT WHAT WAS SO

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.589
LAST YEAR WE DID INVEST THREE

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.123
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:57.426
DOING JUST THAT YES EXACTLY OUR

01:14:57.492 --> 01:15:00.562
CONCERN IS THAT WE INVESTED NON

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:01.897
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.398
GENERAL FUND THE LA OWES

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.133
PROPOSAL IS TO PRO TO INVEST

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.201
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.836
GENERAL FUND. SO WE JUST KNOW

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.905
THAT THAT'S A CONCERN. OUR

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.774
THANK YOU. SOMEONE NUMBER

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:15.244
LIMóN THANK YOU AT AND I WANT

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:16.812
TO ECHO WHAT SOME OF MY

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:17.512
COLLEAGUES HAVE ECHOED ABOUT

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:19.715
THE COLA- IT'S A BIG DEAL IT'S

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.350
IMPORTANT TO WEST SO IF IT'S

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:23.051
NOT IN PROJECTED BUDGET I THINK

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:24.286
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.822
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:28.724
PRIORITIZE IT EATS IT'S AN

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:30.792
IMPORTANT. AT ELEMENT THAT WE

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:31.627
NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.395
ACHIEVE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:34.196
AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:35.330
MORE BASIC ELEMENTS AS I.

01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:38.333
REVIEW AND LOOK OVER- ALL OTHER

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.403
IDEAS- YOU KNOW I LIKE A LOT OF

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:42.871
THESE ONE TIME SPENDING.

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:45.007
CATEGORIES BUT I ALSO FIND

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:48.243
THAT- THE START OFF AS ONE TIME

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.279
BUT THEN WE'RE BACK AVING THIS

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:51.580
CONVERSATION WILL WE FIND IT

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.782
LAST YEAR- AND SO I DO WE KEEP

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.817
GOING. ON AND KEEP FINDING IT

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.086
SO- IN THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A

01:15:58.153 --> 01:16:00.355
LONG LIST OF ONE TIME-

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:03.392
INITIATIVES- AND I EIGHT THINK

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.793
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO PRIORITIZE

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.028
WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:08.463
LEGISLATURE. ON SOME OF THESE-

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:11.400
ALL ARE GOOD ALL I LIKE ALL I

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.869
CAN LIVE WITH- HOWEVER I DON'T

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.103
KNOW THAT WE CAN DO ALL OF

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:20.075
THEM. I'M ON THE CHILD

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:20.709
NUTRITION RE AT REIMBURSEMENT.

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:21.810

TO THAT. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:41.663
SOME OF THIS IS CALIFORNIA

01:43:35.075 --> 01:43:36.243
THAT HAPPEN AND WE'RE ASKING

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:38.045
FOR THAT REIMBURSEMENT- THIS

01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:40.547
YEAR WILL BE THE FIRST YEAR. OF

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:43.483
STUDENTS WHO WERE ASI RBG

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:44.751
SUPPORTED WHO ARE GOING TO BE

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:46.119
WALKING ACROSS THE GRADUATION

01:43:46.186 --> 01:43:50.090
STAGE AND WE WANTED TO BE NOT

01:43:50.157 --> 01:43:51.825
THE LAST. THANK YOU. CAN REALLY

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:53.193
RESUME REST SOMEPLACE

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:54.928
INTERNATIONAL UNION WE ARE ALSO

01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:56.163
A MEMBER OF EDUCATION COALITION

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:58.699
IS ONE TO THROW THAT IN- AND WE

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:00.133
ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.535
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WE THINK

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:02.569
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:04.237
WERE. OVERLOOKED WE WERE JUST

01:44:04.304 --> 01:44:05.439
WE NOT TO SEE MODERATE TO

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.274
SEVERE A SPECIAL NEEDS INCLUDED

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:08.442
WE BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY ABOUT

01:44:08.508 --> 01:44:10.177
A NEED THAT SCHOOLS ARE. KIND

01:44:10.243 --> 01:44:11.612
OF DYING ON THE VINE FIND

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:12.980
FUNDING BUT IT'S ALSO AN EQUITY

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:13.647
ISSUE AS WE HAVE A

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:14.648
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:15.983
COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE

01:44:16.049 --> 01:44:17.084
OF STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW

01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:18.518
INCOME AND THEY'RE SO. IF WE'RE

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:20.220
ABLE TO FUND SEVERE TO MODERATE

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:21.388
WE STOP CANNIBALIZING THE BEES

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.923
WHICH STOPS CANNIBALIZING LC FF

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:24.491
SO WE DO THINK THAT OVERALL

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:25.592
IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT YOUR

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:27.961
DOLLARS- I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:29.296

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:30.797
AGREE WITH THE LOCAL PRODUCE

01:44:30.864 --> 01:44:32.032
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.533
THAT IT'S AN ACCESS ISSUE. WE

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.835
HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:37.004
ROLLING FOR FEAR- IN FOR YOU

REDUCED PRICE LUNCH- WE'RE

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:39.439
SEEING A DECLINE THERE BUT THAT

01:44:39.506 --> 01:44:40.107
DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T HAVE

01:44:40.173 --> 01:44:41.475
HUNGRY STUDENTS. SO WE THINK

01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:42.743
THOSE DOLLARS TO REALLY LOOK AT

01:44:42.809 --> 01:44:44.511
ACCESS A SOME SCHOOLS ARE DOING

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:45.979

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:47.581
THEY'VE BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:48.448
INSURING THAT KIDS GO HOME WITH

01:44:48.515 --> 01:44:50.217
