AB AND- IN THE MIST OF OUR STATE'S WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND. ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST EFFECTIVE HOUSING FINANCING TOOLS ARE STATES AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT. INCREASING THE TAX CREDIT BY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD IN TURN LEVERAGE. ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAX CREDITS LOCAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT. WHILE I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDED A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. ON LIKE THIS BILL THE INCREASES ONE TIME AND FUTURE INCREASES WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO AND APPROPRIATIONS. AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM OUR WITNESSES AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS LINE UP FUNDING SOURCES YEARS IN ADVANCE. AND INVESTORS NEED CERTAINTY. FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OUR STATE LOST ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN. THIS TAX RATES INVESTOR EQUITY DUE TO FEDERAL TAX LAW CHANGES. AND HAVING A STATE TAX CREDIT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FUNDED IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WILL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT INVESTORS WITH. LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO A WITNESSES THANK YOU SO MUCH THEM OVER TO OUR WITNESSES YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES WE WELCOME YOU WHO WOULD LIKE TO THEY KICKED OFF. PERSONALIZE NAY WHEN ORGANIZATION HEY I WELCOME BACK. MEMBERS I JULIE SNYDER REPRESENTING HOUSING CALIFORNIA A CO SPONSOR OF AB TEN AS YOU WELL KNOW ACCORDING TO THE STATE HOUSING DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY SHORT ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES THAT ARE AFFORDABLE THE CALIFORNIANS EARNING LESS THAN HALF OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. AND THE SHORTFALLS NOT GONNA DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT BUT CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE VERY STEADY PROGRESS TOWARDS THE DAY THESE FOLKS ARE NO LONGER HOMELESS OR PAYING TOO MUCH FOR RENT IT IS GOING TO TAKE BOLD STRATEGIES THAT HAVE PINPOINT TARGETING TO HELP THOSE WITH THE LEAST UP FIRST AND AB TEN FITS THIS BILL IT INCREASES APPROVING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW GENERATES RESULTS. THE PROGRAM NEEDS NO RAMP UP IT WILL SERVE YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE LEAST LIKELY TO BE SERVED BY THE PRIVATE MARKET FOR THIS REASON WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE A CO SPONSOR AND REQUEST DRIVE OUT THANK YOU. I THINK BEING HERE GOOD MORNING MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RIGHT AWAY WITH A CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM OUR FOLKS ARE THE DEVELOPERS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED IN PUTTING TOGETHER DEVELOPMENT DEALS I JUST WANT TO EXPAND A BIT ON WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MENTIONED WE'RE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE INCLUSION IN AB ONE A ONE OF THE ONE TIME EXPANSION OF THE STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX. PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO DO IT. AGAIN SIGNIFICANT. THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE TO DEAL ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WE NEED TO HAVE THIS BE AN ONGOING SOURCE TO THE GAME PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. AND PLAN ON. INCREASING THAT PIPELINE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND FOR THAT WE REALLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD TO SEE YOU WERE IN A WELCOME ANYONE WHO'S IN SUPPORT THE BILL.

FOR BEST MISS MINE I SEE SIR ANYONE ELSE WHO'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT. HEARING SEE NINE NUMBER TO WELCOME ANYONE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED PLEASE PORT. HEARING SEEN OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER TO THE COMMITTEE TO BE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WILL START WITH THE VICE CHAIR ANY QUESTIONS COMES VICE CHAIR. HERE LOOKING UP AT THE AMOUNT OF TAX CREDITS SEVEN. PROVIDED OVER THE LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS TO ADD I DON'T SEE IN THE STATUS STAFF REPORT LIKE A LIKE A CHARGE OF HOW. THE STATE HAS BEEN DOING TO DATE AND I'M. SORRY THAT I DIDN'T HOLD UP SOONERS DEAR GOOD GETTING BACK FROM BREAK I. DIDN'T GET TO TIME I'M JUST WEARING DOES DOES HOUSING NOW I'M GETTING TO SOMEONE'S GETTING TO AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S WEBSITE DOES HOUSING CALIFORNIA PROVIDE AT THAT DATA. IT WILL ROUGHLY WERE AT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR UNDER THE CURRENT TAX CREDIT PROGRAM SO OF THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN PROBABLY ABOUT A BILLION. SO WE'RE DOING KIND OF A FLAT HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. EIGHT IT'S BEEN ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHTY MILLION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS A HUNDRED MILLION THIS YEAR I THINK A COUPLE THINGS OF NOTE FOR THAT IS IT'S WOEFULLY BELOW WHAT THE STATE USED TO SPEND ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO. BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION WE SPENT ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR MORE THAN WE'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING AND SO THE TAX RATE AS I'M AS I MENTIONED IS AGAIN BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE PAST. DECADE ALSO PROBABLY UNDER SUBSCRIBES TO THE NEED IS CLOSER TO ABOUT A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT ARE LOOKING TO GET FUNDED AROUND THE STATE BLESSING I'LL JUST MENTION AS I. MENTIONED BEFORE IS EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND AT THE STATE LEVEL LEVERAGES TO FEDERAL TAX DOLLARS ON TAX CREDITS AND THEN AND EVEN MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS A SORT OF LOCAL DOLLARS AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT SO AGAINONE PRIVATE SECTOR ONE STATE DOLLAR OF INVESTMENT. CHUMS ANOTHER THREE FOUR FIVE OTHER DOLLARS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENT AND THAT'S WHY IT IS APPRECIATED. WONDERFUL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGH THE PROCESS. YEAH MAYBE I COULD. TAKE IT DOWN TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL. HOW MANY HOW MANY DEVELOPERS HAVE REQUESTED THE CREDIT. AND HOW MUCH HAS BEEN GRANTED AND IT IS THE AMOUNT OF REQUESTS HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE AMOUNT THAT'S AVAILABLE SO AS I AS I SAID EARLIER IT HAS BEEN MASSIVELY OVERSUBSCRIBED SO I WOULD SAY AT LEAST I HEARD UNDER SUBSCRIBE SO NOTE SO FOUR FIVE TIMES AS MUCH ANTICIPATED DEMAND IS FOUR FIVE TIMES WHAT WE HAVE AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS MOVING FORWARD. WHEN IT VERIFY THAT FOR THE RECORD APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU I THINK THIS VICE YOUR THINK THE LESS THERE IS WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR PROJECTS BENEFITTED JUST FROM THE STATE SIDE BUT HUNDRED TWO MILLION IN THAT YEAR IS WELL WITHIN THAT AS- THE GRUESOME AND SAID AT LEVERAGES FEDERAL DOLLARS TO COME IN AS WELL. SO OR GO TO THE CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR HIS WORK ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE. OF JUST GOT THE WORD ON THE NO FOLLOW THE NOTICE OF FINANCING A BILL REALLY FOR THE HOUSING BONDS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. LAST YEAR THEY HAD THREE TIMES.

COMPLETE ORDER COMPANIES OFFER A BETTER CHANCE OF FINE FOR A ADDITIONALLY IN THE STATE IS IN THE SUCCESS OF COMPANIES WILL ALLOW US TO RAISE THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY ALLOCATED BY GOBIZ IN FACT IF THE TEST IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY MEDICAL BILLS CAN BECOME A SELFISH SELF FUNDED PROGRAM AB TEN TWENTY SEVEN HAS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND HAS NO OPPOSITION THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ARE ABLE THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER PRECIADO YOU WERE AS WITH ACT BETTER OPEN. IT UP TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE I'M FOR. PLAN FROM THE MORLOCKS TO THE SENATE FOR THE OTHER DAY WAS GREAT TO BE TO SEE ALL THE GRAND BABIES WHOSE COULD STOP.

ARE THEY HOME NOW OR FLYING AS WE SPEAK. MANY OBVIOUSLY MILWAUKEE BUT WE TOOK THEM AROUND SACRAMENTO WE DID THE GREAT. WE DID THIS SACRAMENTO TRAIN OUR UNIT FOR LUNCH ON SUNDAY AND WE DID. WHAT TO THE JELLY BELLY FACTORY YOU KNOW WE DID ALL THESE. WITH GRAND KIDS AND WE JUST HAD A GREAT TIME I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT AND- I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE TRAIN I TRY TO GET ON THE TRAIN IT CHRISTMAS TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIKE A SPECIAL CHRISTMAS TIME THING BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT REALLY EARLY. YEAH AND I'M NOT THAT ORGANIZED. TRAIN ROBBERY. ACTORS ON BOARD ALONE SUNDAY. AND AT THE END THE ROBBERS APOLOGIZE TO MY FOR YOU. AND HE APPRECIATED THAT BECAUSE HE WAS PRETTY SHOOK UP I BET. THEY APOLOGIZE. A VERY EAGLE AS AMERICANS MIKE QUESTIONING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M JUST THE THERE'S A AT A HISTORICAL TERM CALLED GRUB STEAK AND A LOT OF MERCHANTS WOULD. GIVE OF MINING EQUIPMENT TROUBLES AND ALL THE REST TO MINORS FOR A GRUB STAKE IN IF THE MINOR DID WELL THEN THE MERCHANT WOULD OWN A PORTION OF THE MINOR THE CLAIMANT AND SO THAT WAS JUST LIKE IN THE ARTICLE IS A RISK KIND OF A THING I AND I'M KIND OF SITTING HERE GOING THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL REMINDS ME OF ITS CREATIVE IT'S BUT I I'M- I WERE READY TO GET. FROM OUR BUSINESSES 4% HAVE FUN MONEY YES INCOME TAX AND PROPERTY TAX AND PAYROLL TAXES AND SO I'M TRYING TO GET MY ARMS AROUND. THIS CONTENT. THIS IS IN LIEU OF THAT THIS THISIS SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE CREDIT. THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL CREDIT THAT THEY WOULD BE APPLYING FOR AND SO THIS IS WE DON'T THERE'S NO POTENTIAL LOSS FOR THE STATE. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EXTENDING CREDIT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT PARTNER EXACTLY SO THERE'S NO ACTUAL RISK IN THIS CASE TO THE STATE AND IT WOULD JUST GIVE THEM AN ADDITIONAL. CREDIT RIGHT BUT IT WILL GIVE THE STATE THE RIGHT TO. AUDIT THE BOOKS AND ONLY WELL ONLY AT THE TIME WHEN. BUT LIKE WHEN WE FIRST DECIDE WHAT THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THIS THE COMPANY IS IN THE STATE WOULD INTO AN INDEPENDENT. AUDITOR WOULD AUDIT THE COMPANY TO DECIDE ACTUAL VALUE. AND THEN WHEN IT CAME TIME TO SELL THERE WOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. AND IF IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT AND IT. NO LOSS TO US WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM CREDIT WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. WELL I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A DO WE HAVE ANY. SIMILAR PROGRAMS AROUND THE COUNTRY AT THE STATE. CALPERS. TOPICS ARE THE RIVER CALPERS A BY STOCK OF A COMPANY THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT ANIMAL ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE INVESTED IN THE PAST AND SPECIFIC. AN IMPRESSIVE PROJECT MICROPHONE ON ANY GIVEN THE SENATORS IN SEVERAL YES THE CARLSON DOWN ASSEMBLY REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE. CALPERS HAS IN THE PAST INVESTED IN INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES THEY DON'T ALWAYS DO THAT SOMETIMES THEY GO THROUGH A LARGER INSTITUTION THAT INVEST IN INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES THEY DON'T ALWAYS INVEST. JUST IN STOCKS PUBLICLY. TRADED COMPANIES YEAH IF IT WITH BRIGHT THEY HAVE. OTHER OTHER VENTURE CAPITAL THEY CAN INVEST IN BUT THIS IS THIS IS WORK COMPANIES COMING UP AND SAYING. WE WANT TO CREDIT BUT WE'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR THAT CREDIT TO TRADE OFF. RIGHT AND THEY'RE APPLYING ANYWAY SO IT'S JUST SIR OTHER COMES SO THIS IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR THAT THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED AND THIS IS INITIAL VOLUNTARY FACTOR THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED. SO THEY'RE ALREADY COMING FOR THE CREDIT THIS IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR THAT THING ON I'M LOOKING AT IS A CPA KINDA GOING HOW WHAT I WOULD WHAT I. WHAT I CALL A IT JUST DEPENDS AND IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE COMPANY FOR A LARGER COMPANY IT'S EASIER TO PRIDE PROVIDE MORE INCENTIVES FOR A SMALLER COMPANY THEY HAVE LESS INCENTIVES AND SO THIS IS ACTUALLY A BENEFIT TO SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT ARE APPLYING FOR THE CREDIT IS ACTUALLY WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO BE. SEVEN ONE BURKE I REALLY LIKE THE CREATIVITY. I IN THANK CARL.

THIS IN THE WOMAN AT BROUGHT FOR THIS IDEA. BUT BY ANY OTHER INDUSTRY GROUP BUT THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO HER WE WANTED KNOWLEDGE YOUR HARD WORK ON THE SHARE OUR VALUES TAX CREDIT ON YOU HAVE BEEN PUT IN A LOT OF BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS INTO THIS ISSUE WE JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. ARE AND WE ALSO WANT TO SEE A THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL WE'RE GONNA TRY IT OVER TO THE SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT IN THE WILL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE SOME OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND- FRIENDS I'D ALSO LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING YOU AND- COMMITTEE. FOR HELPING WITH THIS LEGISLATION THE YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF WAS INVALUABLE IN HELPING CRAFT THIS AND SO NOW I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE TO PRESENTED. I WILL BE IN THE COMMITTEE IS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT REDUCE. REDUCE THE ALLOCATION TO FIFTY MILLION PER YEAR OVER FIVE YEARS. ALSO THE TECHNICAL CLEANUP LANGUAGE. OF AB FOURTEEN FORTY TWO ESTABLISHES THE SHARE OUR VALUES FILM TAX CREDIT. AND WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD ALLOCATE FIFTY MILLION PER YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS. FOR FILM PRODUCTION RELOCATION FROM STATE SEEKING TO RESTRICT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION RIGHTS. OPERATIONALLY THE LEGISLATION MIMICS THE EXISTING FILM TAX CREDIT THREE POINT NO THAT MEANS THAT THE FILM COMMISSION PROVIDES OVERSIGHT AND DEVELOPS RULES AND GUIDELINES. CREDITS WILL BE ISSUED ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS AND AS AND THIS IS ONLY OPEN TO APPLICANTS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE RELOCATION TAX CREDITS UNDER THE EXISTING THREE POINT OH PROGRAM. SIMILAR TO THE PROCESS ESTABLISHED IN THE. THREE POINT OH FILM TAX CREDIT WHICH REQUIRES AN APPLICANT TO SUBMIT A NARRATIVE STATEMENT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A RELOCATION CREDIT. AB FOURTEEN FORTY TWO REQUIRES THAT THE APPLICANT SUBMIT A NARRATIVE STATEMENT DESCRIBING HOW THEY SHARE CALIFORNIA'S VALUES. GUARDS TO REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SEVERAL OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES HAVE ACTIVELY RECRUITED THE FILM INDUSTRY FROM CALIFORNIA MAINLY THROUGH EXTENSIVE TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS. RECENTLY NEW MEXICO NEW YORK ILLINOIS AND OTHERS HAVE SOUGHT TO ENTICE INDUSTRIES FILMING AND STATES. OF WITH STRICT ABORTION LAWS TO RELOCATE THEIR PRODUCTION TO THOSE STATES IN CALIFORNIA THE FILM INDUSTRY IS ONE OF OUR FLAGSHIP INDUSTRIES. CALIFORNIA'S FILM TAX CREDIT NOT ONLY GENERATES CORPORATE INCOME TAX AND PERSONAL INCOME TAX REVENUES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ARE NOT FORCING THESE EMPLOYEES TO SEEK WORK IN STATES THAT HAVE SHOWN THEY DO NOT VALLEY WOMEN OR THE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. FOR TEXT ON THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE FILM INDUSTRY ACCORDING TO RECENT STUDIES WITH A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION INVESTMENT APPROVED PRODUCTIONS WOULD GENERATE NEARLY ONE POINT NINE BILLION OF DIRECT IN STATE SPENDING. THIS MEANS SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION AND QUALIFIED WAGES SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND QUALIFIED VENDOR EXPENDITURES AND THE HIRING OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND CAST AND NINE THOUSAND CREW MEMBERS. THE COMMISSION STUDY HELPS QUANTIFY THE LABOR AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF FURTHER INVESTING IN THIS FILM TAX CREDIT. WILD IS FIGURES ARE IMPRESSIVE THERE ARE OTHER FACTS AND FIGURES THAT ARE EQUALLY NOTEWORTHY. ALABAMA RECENTLY BANNED ABORTION FROM THE TIME A WOMAN IS KNOWN TO BE PREGNANT WITH NO EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE AND INCEST. GEORGIA BANNED ABORTIONS AT SIX WEEKS THE STATE CAN INVESTIGATE WOMEN'S MISCARRIAGES AND DOCTORS COULD BE SENTENCED TO UP TO TEN YEARS IN PRISON. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT GEORGIA HAS THE SECOND WORST MATERNAL MATURE BUT MORTALITY RATES IN THE US IT'S TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY I COULD GO ON AND ON. THESE ARE THE SAME STATES THAT HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY LOWERED FILM PRODUCTION FROM CALIFORNIA. AB FOURTEEN FORTY TWO PROVIDES THE FILM INDUSTRY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEY STAND WITH WOMEN AND SHARE OUR VALUES WHILE BRINGING CRITICAL JOBS BACK TO OUR STATE. I'D LIKE TO THANK MY CO AUTHORS INCLUDING CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS SENATOR LEYVA AND ASSEMBLY WOMANLY MULLIN. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK ON LABOR FOR STANDING WITH WOMEN AND THEIR RIGHTS. AND TODAY I'M FORTUNATE TO HAVE ALEX SECULAR WITH LABOR'S LOCAL SEVEN TWO FOUR.

BRIEF TESTIMONY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AS AN LIMóN PRECIADO DEAD WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO TO KICKS OFF STRAGGLER PLEASED TO FLOOR SORCERY OF TWO MINUTES WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ALEX ANNULAR I AM THE BUSINESS MANAGER FOR LABOR'S LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY FOUR. WHICH IS AN AFFILIATE WHICH IS AFFILIATED WITH THE LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OR NORTH AMERICA. BETTER KNOWN TO ALL OF YOU AS LIKE YOU IN A. LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY FOUR REPRESENTS OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS LABORS WHO WORK IN THE MOTION PICTURE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY. RETURNING FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION WORK TO OUR GREAT STATE IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE SHARE OUR VALUES TAX CREDIT. WE HAVE CONSPICUOUSLY BEEN STRONG ADVOCATES FOR BOTH THE CREATION EXTENSION OF THE CALIFORNIA FILM. AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION INCENTIVE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND THIS IS WHY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN FORTY TWO IN ITS EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE AND INCENTIVIZE ADDITIONAL FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION RETURNING TO CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A TIME OF GREAT CHANGE AND ALSO OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN OUR BUSINESS WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA IS IN POSITION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES. AB FOURTEEN FORTY TWO WOULD CREATE THOUSANDS OF HIGH QUALITY WELL PAYING JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFIT THE STATE'S OVERALL ECONOMY IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ON BEHALF OF OUR SIXTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT WOMEN AND LEVERS THAT WORK IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY WOMAN THREE OF US FOR SUPPORTING WOMEN AND LABOR AND WORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.-THANK YOU SO MUCH REPRESENTATION TO REGRET FOR YOUR HERE MISS HUMPHREY WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HANGING WITH US THIS MORNING.
