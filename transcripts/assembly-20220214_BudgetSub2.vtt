THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS MATT.

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:18.009
SO IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE LAST

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:20.145
THAN ANY OF THE AREAS SHOWN WE

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:21.179
THINK IT LIKELY WOULD NEED TO

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.114
SPEND MORE AND OTHER STYLE

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:26.251
AREAS- ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:27.852
SPENT MORE AND ANY OF THE AREAS

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.521
SHOWN YOU POTENTIALLY COULD FREE

00:26:29.587 --> 00:26:31.389
UP STYLE SPENDING ELSEWHERE.

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:34.626
WITHIN OR BEYOND THE HIGHER

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:36.061
EDUCATION SECTOR OF THE BUDGET.

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:37.629
SO IT'S TURNING TO THE SEGMENTS

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:39.931
BASED BY JETS YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:41.566
GOVERNOR PROPOSES A FIVE POINT

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:43.234
33% COLA FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.737
APPORTIONMENT. MORE RECENT DATA

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:47.639
SHOWING THAT COLA RATE IS LIKELY

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:49.908
TO COMING CLOSER TO SIX POINT

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.609
SEVENTEEN PERCENT. THAT WOULD

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:53.578
RAISE COSTS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:55.613
MILLION SO INSTEAD OF A FOUR

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.681
HUNDRED AND NINE MILLION DOLLAR

00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:58.483
PORTION INCREASED. COSTS WOULD

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.086
BE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

00:27:01.152 --> 00:27:02.187
MILLION. THE COLOR RATE WILL BE

00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:04.589
LOCKED DOWN IN APRIL BUT WHETHER

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:06.157
FIVE OR SIX OR SIX AND A HALF

00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:07.292
PERCENT THESE ARE AMONG THE

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:10.428
HIGHEST COLDER RATES THE

00:27:10.495 --> 00:27:11.363
COLLEGES WHAT ABOUT PERCEIVED.

00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:12.998
THE COLLEGE PENSION RATES THOUGH

00:27:13.064 --> 00:27:14.432
ALSO ARE INCREASING IN THE

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:17.268
BUDGET YEAR AT AN UNUSUAL PACE.

00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:19.404
TWO POINT 2% FOR THE STIRS

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.339
DISTRICT CONTRIBUTION AND TWO

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:23.241
AND A HALF PERCENT FOR THE PERS

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:25.276
DISTRICT CONTRIBUTION. AND IS

00:27:25.343 --> 00:27:26.978
RELATIVELY HIGH RATES ARE

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.847
LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE X.

00:27:28.913 --> 00:27:32.484
EXPIRATION OF THE PREVIOUS STATE

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.985
PROVIDED PENSION RELIEF. AND

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:35.153
THEN IN ADDITION TO PENSION

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.454
PRESSURES I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:38.289
HEARING ABOUT SALARY PRESSURES

00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:39.357
BOTH THE COLLEGES AND

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:41.426
UNIVERSITIES LIKE WE ARE- ARE

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:42.560
LIKELY TO FACE GREATER THAN

00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:44.429
NORMAL SALARY PRESSURE GIVEN

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.197
INFLATION IS AT HISTORICALLY

00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:49.034
HIGH LEVELS. THE TURN FOR A

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.969
MOMENT IN THE UNIVERSITIES BASED

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:52.370
INCREASE SAYS IF YOU LOOK AT

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:55.140
THINGS HERE SIX ON PAGE SEVEN OF

00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:57.075
THE BUDGET BRIEF. YOU CAN SEE

00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:59.077
ABOUT CSU'S PROJECTED OPERATING

00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:01.312
COSTS SALARIES HEALTH CARE COSTS

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.348
PENSION COSTS LEN IN THAT

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:05.617
SERVICE. THOSE PROJECTED

00:28:05.683 --> 00:28:07.519
OPERATING COSTS ARE TO GROW

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:10.789
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE FIVE

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:11.756
PERCENT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS-

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:13.091
AT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:15.827
PROPOSED. IN CONTRAST UC'S

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:17.295
PROJECTED OPERATING COSTS ARE

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.330
EXPECTED TO GROW SLIGHTLY LESS

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:21.533
THAN ITS GENERAL FUND BASED WHEN

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.668
COUPLED WITH THE TUITION REVENUE

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:25.603
AND EXPECTS TO GAIN. AND THE BIG

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.005
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:29.407
IS THIS TUITION FACTOR SO

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:31.109
WHEREAS THE ISSUES OPERATING

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:33.044
COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO FALL

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:35.814
SHORT. EVERY YEAR PERIOD YOU SEE

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.749
IS EXPECTED TO MAKE ENDS MEET

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.250
LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE GREATER

00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:42.454
TUITION REVENUE THAT'S EXPANDING

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.522
ITS BUDGET CAPACITY. ATTORNEY

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:46.224
GENERAL MATT WITH A FOCUS ON

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:47.826
WHAT OUR MOMENT LEVELS HOW

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:49.160
THEY'VE BEEN CHANGING WHAT'S

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.096
DRIVING THOSE TRENDS ARE THEY

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:53.298
WITHIN THE CAMPUSES CONTROL AND

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:55.233
WHAT CAN THE LEGISLATURE DO

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.001
MOVING FORWARD. SO IF YOU LOOK

00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:59.471
AT FIGURE EIGHT ON PAGE TEN IT

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.172
SHOWS THOSE ENROLLMENT TRENDS.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:02.774
IT SHOWS THAT ENROLLMENT IS DOWN

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:05.977
NOTABLY AT THE COLLEGES OVER THE

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:07.412
PERIOD. IT SAYS THAT CSU

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:10.782
ENROLLMENT WAS GROWING IN

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:11.416
NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:14.452
AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT THEN

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:15.854
FALLON TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IT

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.888
SHOWS THAT YOU SEE ENROLLMENT

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:18.423
CLIMBED OVER MOST OF THE PERIOD

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.560
BUT THEN DECLINED SLIGHTLY IN

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:23.561
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WHEN YOU

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:24.629
WERE STARTING YOUR ENROLLMENT

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:25.797
TARGETS LAST YEAR YOU WERE USING

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:27.065
THE BEST AVAILABLE DATA AT THE

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:29.100
TIME NOT BEST DATA WITH COMING

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:33.138
FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AT THAT

00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:35.340
THE COLLEGES WAS DOWN. BUT THE

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:36.608
DATA WAS SHOWING THE ENROLLMENT

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:38.309
AT THE UNIVERSITY IS WAS MORE

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:40.645
ROBUST THAN EXPECTED. EVEN IN

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.180
THE EARLY PART OF THE PANDEMIC

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:43.348
WITH THE SHIFT TO REMOTE

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:45.683
OPERATIONS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.685
INVOLVEMENT AT THE UNIVERSITIES

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:49.287
BROUGH. SO GIVEN THE STATE OF

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:51.356
MOST FOLKS SIX SUSPECTED THAT

00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:52.490
UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT WOULD

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:54.526
CONTINUE TO GROW IN TWENTY ONE

00:29:54.592 --> 00:29:56.928
TWENTY TWO. PARTICULARLY WITH

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.062
THE SHIFT BACK TO IN PERSON

00:29:58.129 --> 00:29:59.564
INSTRUCTION. A SENSE THAT TIME

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:00.698
WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE UPDATED

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:02.066
DATA IS SHOWING THE ENROLLMENT

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.802
IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:06.104
WEAKER THAN EXPECTED AT ALL OF

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:08.106
THE SEGMENTS. WHAT'S DRIVING THE

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:10.542
CHANGES. ONE FACTOR IS THE JOB

00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:11.743
MARKET WE KNOW THAT THE JOB

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.444
MARKET IS GOOD RIGHT NOW MANY

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.346
JOB OPENINGS A RECENT INCREASE

00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:17.849
IN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. WE

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:19.684
JUST MORE BROADLY ARE RISING.

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:21.119
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.420
AND SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.989
JOB MARKET. YOU SEE ENROLLMENT

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:27.759
AND CONTRAST IS THE LEAST THE

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.327
FACTOR OF THE THREE SEGMENTS.

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:30.929
MUNITY COLLEGES ALSO HAVE MORE

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:32.530
STUDENTS TO HAVE CHILDREN SO

00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:34.799
THESE ADULTS MIGHT HAVE HAD TO

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:36.301
TAKE TIME AWAY FROM SCHOOL AND

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:37.569
WORK SO THEY COULD CARE FOR

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:38.736
THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND OTHER

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:40.271
FAMILY MEMBERS. AND THIS

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:41.706
CHALLENGE AGAIN IS MOST

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:42.774
PREVALENT AMONG COMMUNITY

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.510
COLLEGES THESE PREVALENT AT UC.

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.712
I'M BOTH FACTORS THE JOB MARKET

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:49.214
AND CHILD CARE RESPONSIBILITIES

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.716
ARE LARGELY BEYOND THE DIRECT

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:53.518
CONTROL OF THE CAMPUS AS- WE

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:54.852
ALSO KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S

00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:55.653
HAPPENING AT THE COMMUNITY

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.722
COLLEGES. M. AND STARTING TO

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:59.257
IMPACT WHAT WERE SEEN AT THE

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.825
UNIVERSITIES SO TRANSFER

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:03.528
APPLICATIONS TO CSU FOR EXAMPLE

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:05.563
ARE DECLINING HAVE BEEN

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.765
DECLINING. SO THE DECISIONS

00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:09.867
BEFORE YOU ENTERED WHICH ARMS OF

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:11.970
WHAT TO DO ABOUT INVOLVEMENT AND

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.671
YOUR CHURCH TRADITIONALLY DO SAT

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:15.240
AND ROMAN TARGETS FOR EACH OF

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:17.242
THE SEGMENTS. OVER THE PAST FEW

00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:19.010
YEARS YOU TYPICALLY START THEM

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.312
FOR BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE THIS

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:22.914
GIVES THE UNIVERSITIES TIME TO

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:23.948
PLAN AND MANAGE THEIR

00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:25.817
INVOLVEMENT WHILE STILL ALLOWING

00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:28.086
YOU DOES THAT OVERALL TAX THAT'S

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:30.822
LEVELS. UNLESS STATE TYPICALLY

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:31.856
PROVIDES ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:34.292
FUNDING NOT TO LINE TO THOSE

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:35.693
TARGETS. THE STATE DOESN'T

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.562
TYPICALLY GO BACK AND ADJUST

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:38.930
ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:41.399
RETROACTIVELY. SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:42.433
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT THE

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.270
STATE PROVIDED CSU WITH GROWTH

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:47.472
FUNDING IN NINETEEN TWENTY TO

00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:49.641
GROW BY TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:52.010
AND ENDED UP GROWING BY ABOUT

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:52.910
FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS BUT THE

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.712
STATE DIDN'T GO BACK AND ADJUST

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.682
CSU'S LEVEL CORD A FUNDING LEVEL

00:31:57.749 --> 00:31:59.284
ACCORDINGLY. YOU SEE OVER THE

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.519
PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS EXCEEDED

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.221
ITS BUDGET TARGETS IN THE STATE

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:04.522
HASN'T EVEN KNOWING THAT THE

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:07.792
STATE HASN'T TO DATE GONE AND

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:08.793
PROVIDED YOU SEE FIND MORE

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.728
FUNDING. THE MAIN REASON THE

00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:11.963
STATE DOESN'T MAKE THESE

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.731
RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS IS

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:14.766
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT THE

00:32:14.832 --> 00:32:16.834
STATEMENTS TO DISREGARD THE

00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:18.603
STATE TARGETS SO IT DOESN'T ON

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.438
THE STATE THE STATE DOESN'T WANT

00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:21.939
TO ENCOURAGE THE STATEMENTS.

00:32:22.006 --> 00:32:23.841
INDEPENDENTLY MAKE THEIR OWN

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.276
TARGETS THEIR OWN DECISIONS

00:32:25.343 --> 00:32:27.545
ABOUT ACCESS ABOUT ASSOCIATED

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:29.213
STATE COSTS ABOUT ASSOCIATED

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.582
PROGRAM QUALITY THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:32.750
HAS WANTED TO MAKE THESE

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.819
DECISIONS IN COORDINATION WITH

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:36.321
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:32:36.387 --> 00:32:37.522
SEGMENTS. THE LEGISLATURE DOES

00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:38.756
HOWEVER TYPICALLY TAKE INTO

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.425
ACCOUNT ANY UPDATED ENROLLMENT

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:43.895
DATA WHEN IT SUCKS IT'S NEW

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:45.363
ENROLLMENT TARGETS. SO MOVING

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.099
FORWARD. FOR THE COLLEGE AS-

00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:49.400
PROVIDING A ROAMING GROWTH

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.636
FUNDING EVEN IF IT'S ON USED IS

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:52.837
VERY LOW OVER ASK IF THE

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:54.539
COLLEGES DON'T USE THAT THAT

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:57.342
FUNDING- REVERTS TO THE PROP

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:58.242
NINETY EIGHT RIVERS AN ACCOUNT

00:32:58.309 --> 00:33:00.578
BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PROP

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:03.214
NINETY EIGHT PURPOSES. AT CSU

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:04.582
YOU COULD CONSIDER NOT PROVIDING

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:06.617
A MOMENT FUNDING IN TWENTY TWO

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:08.419
TWENTY THREE. DS USER AGREEMENT

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.555
IS EXPECTED TO STILL BE DOWN

00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:12.724
FROM PREVIOUSLY FUNDED LEVELS.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:13.925
BUT YOU COULD CONSIDER SPENDING

00:33:13.991 --> 00:33:16.294
A NEW TARGET FOR TWENTY THREE

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:16.961
TWENTY FOUR THAT WOULD TAKE INTO

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:18.429
ACCOUNT THIS MOST RECENT WOMAN

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:21.499
DATA. ARE YOU SEE EIGHT YOU

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:23.868
COULD PROVIDE LESS FUNDING IN

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:25.103
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THAN YOU

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:26.070
EXPECTED A YEAR AGO BECAUSE I'M

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:28.373
GONNA AS EXPECTED TO. NOT MEET

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:30.074
THE TARGET THAT USE THAT. BUT

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.510
THEN AGAIN MOVING FORWARD FOR

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:33.711
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YOU

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:35.012
COULD USE THAT MOST RECENT

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.848
EMPLOYMENT DATA THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:37.682
SET A NEW TARGET. REGARDLESS OF

00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:38.883
WHAT YOU DECIDE THAT THE

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.084
STATEMENTS IF YOU DECIDE ON A

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:41.686
ROMAN TARGET WE WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.788
YOU TO SET ASIDE. AFFECTIVELY

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.056
RESERVE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:46.524
FUNDING SO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:48.626
AND BE ABLE TO COVER IT. IN THE

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:49.794
YEAR IN WHICH THE GROWTH

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.462
MATERIALIZE THAT THIS THIS IS

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:53.030
WHAT YOU HAD DONE THE LAST FEW

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:53.798
YEARS. AND THAT WOULD BE IN

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:55.066
CONTRAST TO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:56.834
APPROACH IN THE OUT YEARS OF

00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:58.636
FINDING IT WITH IN THE BASE.

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.304
FUNDING AND AS A STANDALONE ITEM

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.907
IS JUST A MORE TRANSPARENT

00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:04.342
BUDGET PRACTICE. FINALLY ON

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:06.177
FACILITY MAINTENANCE OVER THE

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:07.612
LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE STATE HAS

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:09.180
BEEN PROVIDING THE SEGMENTS ONE

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:11.082
TIME FUNDING FOR THEIR BACKLOGS.

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:13.384
EVEN WITH THE STATE ALLOCATIONS.

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:14.952
OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACKLOG

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:16.888
IS ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL AS IT

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:19.590
WAS FIVE YEARS AGO. BOTH THE CSU

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.959
AND UC BACKLOGS ARE NOTABLY

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:24.595
LARGER TODAY. A COUPLE OF YEARS

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:25.797
AGO THE LEGISLATURE ASK THE

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:27.165
UNIVERSITY IS TO THE METS

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:29.467
FACILITY MAINTENANCE REPORT BOTH

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:30.468
OF THOSE REPORTS HAVE BEEN

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.737
SUBMITTED WE HAD A CHANCE TO

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.906
LOOK AT THEM. THEY SHOW THAT CSU

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:36.407
IS FALLING ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:37.642
MILLION DOLLARS SHORT OF

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:39.277
SPENDING WHAT IT NEEDS TO ON AN

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:41.279
ANNUAL BASIS TO ADDRESS THE

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:43.581
CAPITAL RENEWAL. AND YOU SEE THE

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:45.283
SPENDING ABOUT A BILLION LAST

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:47.285
THAN WHAT IT NEEDS ANNUALLY TO

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:48.920
ADDRESS ITS CAPITAL RENEWAL SO

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.621
THAT'S NOT EVEN TO ADDRESS THE

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:54.091
EXISTING BACKLOG THAT'S JUST TO

00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:55.193
KEEP THE BACKLOG FROM GROWING.

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.260
ADDRESSING THESE LARGE

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:57.995
UNDERLYING BUDGET CAPS IS LIKELY

00:34:58.062 --> 00:35:00.064
TO BE DAUNTING. BUT WE ENCOURAGE

00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:01.566
YOU TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:03.668
TO ADDRESS THEM AND ULTIMATELY

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:04.836
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH

STATEMENTS TO BUILD A LONG TERM

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:09.273
PLAN. THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.042
BACKLOG AND FULLY FUND THE

00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:13.244
ESTIMATED ANNUAL CAPITAL RENEWAL

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:16.113
NEEDS. I KNOW I WENT OVER THAT

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:16.747
PRETTY QUICKLY AND I'M HAPPY TO

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:18.549

AND THE UC. AND AS YOU'RE AWARE

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:45.329
THAT WE ADDITIONALLY HAVE

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:47.131
FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:50.501
FOR THE SHIFT OF NINE HUNDRED

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:52.670
TWO STUDENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:53.371

CURRENTLY. AND NON RESIDENT

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.175
STUDENTS AT THREE CAMPUSES AND

00:37:58.242 --> 00:37:59.577
THAT WOULD BE SHIFTING TO

I GUESS THAT THE ISSUE THAT THAT

WE- ARE GRAPPLING WITH IS THAT.

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.303
IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.172
WOULD HAVE AT LEAST SIX THOUSAND

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:31.375

CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.621
A ROUGH ROAD. WITH NO OR VERY

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:13.090
LITTLE OFFICE HOURS- NO

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:14.425
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:16.593
STUDENTS AND AS THE ARTICLE

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.595
POINTS OUT SOMETIMES NOT EVEN

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:20.698
HAVING THE RESPECT OF OTHER

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:22.633
FACULTY MEMBERS AT THEIR OWN

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.003

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:34.144
SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:38.816
FOR PART TIME HEALTH INSURANCE-

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:41.385
BECAUSE THEY AND ESPECIALLY

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:44.321
THOSE PART TIME FACULTY WHO HAVE

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:47.091
TO GO FROM ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:49.626
TO ANOTHER HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:52.429
TIME IN GETTING- HEALTH

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:55.799

HAVE TO- THE L. A. O. IS. AND TO

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:04.775
THOSE FACULTY WHO HAVE TO GO

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:09.747
FROM ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER. THE EXISTING PROGRAM CURRENTLY

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:11.749
DOESN'T ALLOW FOR ANY

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.283
REIMBURSEMENTS FOR THESE SO

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.420
CALLED FREQUENT FREEWAY FLYERS

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.055
DESPITE WORKING OVER 40%

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:22.459
WORKLOAD. AND I WOULD- ADVOCATE

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:24.762
TO CHANGE THAT TO ALLOW IS

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.563
FREEWAY FLYERS TO PAY OUT OF

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.967
POCKET TO PURCHASE HEALTH CARE

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:32.236
AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO. TO

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:34.104
ADDRESS THOSE OF PART TIME

00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:36.206
FACULTY ON HEALTH INSURANCE

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:39.109
BETTER AND THAT IS A QUESTION TO

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:42.279
THE L. A. O. JENNIFER COULD

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.814
SHOWER AGAIN FROM THE ALEJO SO

00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:45.682
THIS WAS A CONCERN THAT WE

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:47.985
RAISED IN OUR ANALYSIS SO. IT'S

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.586
NOT JUST THE YOU WERE RAISING

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.021
THE ISSUE OF A PART TIME FACULTY

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:52.856
MEMBERS WHO MIGHT BE WORKING AT

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:54.458
MULTIPLE DISTRICTS BUT JUST WHAT

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:56.660
THE DISTRICT IS DECIDING WHETHER

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.362
TO GRANT THEM HEALTH CARE

00:44:58.429 --> 00:44:59.630
BENEFITS. AND AT THE SAME TIME

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:00.864
THEY MIGHT BE WORKING ONE YEAR

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:02.266
AND NOT ANOTHER YEAR DEPENDING

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.967
ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:06.703
ENROLLMENT DEMAND- SO IT'S FOR

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:08.739
THESE REASONS THAT A FACULTY A

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:10.140
PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS MIGHT

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:12.209
JUST HAVE A HARD TIME HOLDING ON

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:14.578
TO. GOOD HEALTH CARE YEAR AFTER

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:16.413
YEAR SO AS YOU KNOW COVER

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.515
CALIFORNIA IT IS PROVIDING

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:20.084
HEALTH CARE TO PARK CONTENT

GENEROUSLY SUBSIDIZED DURING THE

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.591
PANDEMIC. AND SO WE WERE JUST

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:29.059
CAUTIONING THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:30.828
BEFORE CREATING A NEW PROGRAM

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.262
THROUGH THE CALL URBAN AND

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:33.864
MASSIVELY EXPANDED PROGRAM

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:35.265
BECAUSE THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT

00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:37.167
EXISTS TODAY DATES FROM THE

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:38.769
NINETIES BEFORE COVER

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:42.005
CALIFORNIA- BUT FOR THE INCREASE

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:43.907
IN SUBSIDIES THAT'S MAKING

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:44.842
HEALTH CARE IDEALLY MORE

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:47.311
AFFORDABLE- SO IT'S PREDATING

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:49.079
COVERED CALIFORNIA'S THE BEFORE

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.380
IT. MAKING THAT PART TIME

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:53.050
HEALTHCARE PROGRAM MUCH BIGGER

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:53.984
WE WERE JUST WANTING TO MAKE

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:56.086
SURE THAT YOU WANT IN THE STATE

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:57.554

00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:59.690
TIME FACULTY MEMBERS BY EIGHT

00:45:59.756 --> 00:46:01.625
MAKING THEM NO LONGER ELIGIBLE

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:03.127
FOR COVER CALIFORNIA BECAUSE AS

00:46:03.193 --> 00:46:05.129
SOON AS THE DISTRICT DOES OFFER

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:07.064
HEALTH CARE. IF IT MEETS A

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.932
CERTAIN AFFORDABILITY THRESHOLD

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.567
THE PART TIME FACULTY OF SORT OF

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:12.936
OBLIGATED TO TAKE AT VAPE

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:14.638
FORFEIT THEIR RIGHT TO

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.875
CALIFORNIA IT WAS ONE JUST SORT

00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:19.910
OF CAUTIONARY NOTE WHICH IS WHY

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.545
WE SAID BEFORE MOVING FORWARD

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:22.546
THE STATE COULD COLLECT MORE

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:24.381
INFORMATION HOW MANY PART TIMERS

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.049

NEW PROGRAMS WITH ON GOING MONEY

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:59.069

RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS PART OF

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:03.640
THE PROCESS. AND THEN TO A

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.041
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF THE RIGHT

00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:06.710
OF THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS

00:54:06.776 --> 00:54:11.014
I BELIEVE IT'S TWENTY THREE

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:11.781
TWENTY FOUR- THOSE HOLD HARMLESS

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:12.983
PROVISIONS. PROVISIONS WOULD

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:16.453
CEASE TO EXIST. IS THAT ACCURATE

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:17.687
THAT'S A QUESTION FOR I DON'T

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:21.891

STUDENT SENATE FUNDING FORMULA

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:31.134
IS SET TO EXPIRE WITH THE TWENTY

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:32.802
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. SO IT'S

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:35.405
CLEAR SAID THE LAST YEAR BE

AND IS IT WAS A WITH THE TO

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:39.409
ELIMINATE THAT THAT SUNSET DATE

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:42.646
SO WHAT WE SET UP AS A CLIFF NOT

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:50.220
NECESSARILY A SLOPE. WHAT. HOLD

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:52.088
HARMLESS PROPOSAL SO DISTRICTS

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:05.635
THEY RECEIVED IN THE PREVIOUS

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:06.970

FORWARD AND COST OF LIVING

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:09.739
ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO THE

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:10.907
RATES UNDER THE STUDENT CENTERED

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:13.309
FUNDING FORMULA- DISTRICTS WOULD

THEY WOULD UNDER THE FULL

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:18.748

A GRADUAL SLOPE TO. ALL

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:21.885

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:29.025
MORE MORE ABOUT HOW THAT IS A

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:30.560
SLOW. AND NOT A CLIFF FOR SOME

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.695
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:33.763

REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET IS

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:42.999
SUFFICIENT TO COVER INFLATION

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:44.467

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:17.313
MENTIONED- 50% OF COMMUNITY

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.049
COLLEGES WILL BE IN PERSON IS

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.818
THERE A REASON. FOR THE 50%

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.820
VERSUS JUST HAVING THEM GO

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:26.789
COMPLETELY BACK IN PERSON. ON

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:27.390
EARTH OBVIOUSLY THE

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.425
UNDERSTANDING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:32.495
GUIDELINES MAY CHANGE THAT. IN

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:34.397
ORDER PART IN A FINANCE.

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:35.898
IMITATIONS PHOTOS REALLY

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.767
DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.470
HAVE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS WHEN

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.438
PURSUING- THEIR ENROLLMENT- WE

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:43.539
NOTICED THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:44.841
WITH A CLIENT AT THE COMMUNITY

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:46.409
COLLEGES AND SO D. D. CORE

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.411
ASPECT OF THE- ADMINISTRATION'S

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.679
PROPOSAL IS REALLY TO ENSURE

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.881
THAT STUDENTS HAVE AVAILABLE

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:54.283
OPTIONS- AND I THINK. THAT'S

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.685
RIGHT ABOUT 50% IS TO TRY TO

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.587
MEET STUDENT DEMAND. GOT GOT IT

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.856
HAVE HAVE WE HEARD FROM STUDENTS

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:02.658
ARE DIFFERENT- COLLEGES THAT

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.694
THIS IS THE WAY THEY WANNA. THEY

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:07.930
WANT TO GO. THERE THERE HAVE

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:11.367
BEEN SOME- ATTEMPTS TO CONDUCT

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:12.535
SURVEYS OF STUDENTS GET

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:13.836
UNDERTAKEN BY THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.738
OFFICE I'D I DEFER TO STAFF AND

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.907
THAT THE CHANCE UP TO SPEAK MORE

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:18.841
TO THE RESULT OF THE SERVICE

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:22.278
BUT- I KNOW THAT HAPPENED TO.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.613
GOT IT SO THAT THE THING THAT WE

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:24.514
COULD SAY FOR CANCER OKAY OKAY

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.783
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GUESS I

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:27.884
WOULD JUST SAY I'M CONCERNED

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.820
ABOUT. OF THE THREE SEGMENTS NOT

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.889
THE ONE SEGMENT THAT HAS NOT.

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:33.990
COME BACK IN PERSON EVEN THOUGH

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:35.792
THE OTHER. INSTITUTIONS HAVE

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.960
FOUND A WAY TO BE BACK IN PERSON

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:41.798
THEY HAVE- THEY HAVE GONE BACK

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.167
TO ONLINE FOR A COUPLE WEEKS BUT

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:44.934
IN GENERAL HAVE BEEN BACK IN

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:47.370
PERSON SO I AM VERY CONCERNED

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:48.471
THAT THE COMMUTER CALL JUST

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.139
CONTINUES TO REMAIN THIS HIGH

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.575
PERCENTAGE. ON THROUGH DISTANCE

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:55.311
LEARNING AND I DO WONDER WHETHER

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.180
THAT'S THEM- KEEPING KEEPING

01:01:57.246 --> 01:02:00.349
STUDENTS LESS MOTIVATED OR

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:03.619
KEEPING STUDENTS AWAY THANK YOU

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:06.522
. SOMEONE ARRESTS. AS A FOLLOW

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:09.392
UP TO YOUR TEAM'S QUESTION IT'S

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.660
CLEAR THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.295
ENROLLMENT HAS SUFFERED THE

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:17.133
GREATEST LOSS AND- SO PERHAPS.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.768
THE THIS I THINK THIS IS

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:19.569
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:21.704
BE VISITED- THE FACT THAT WE'RE

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:24.874
NOW GOING TO FIFTY PERCENT-

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:28.377
ONLINE. BUT I'M WONDERING IF

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:30.446
THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.914
THAT THAT THAT BEEN

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.984
IDENTIFIED- THAT ARE CAUSING THE

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.253
DECREASE IN ENROLLMENT. BOTH AT

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.855
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND AT

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:42.658
CSU'S AND WHAT IT IS WE CAN DO

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:48.831
TO HELP IN THAT REGARD. MAYBE I

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.334
FELT THE SPONSOR JENNIFER PAJALA

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.902
AGAIN AT THE L. A. L. I'M I

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:54.504
THINK IT'S TRICKY AGAIN BECAUSE

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.038
ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS SEEMS TO

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.640
BE THE JOB MARKET AND THE JOB

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:01.244
MARKET IS REALLY COOL AND- SO

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.845
THAT IS A BEEN WE DON'T KNOW

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:05.214
AND- HOW COLLEGE IT NORMALLY WE

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.817
SEE DURING ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:08.317
THAT COLLEGE ENROLLMENT

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:11.320
DECLINES. AND COLLEGES EVEN

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.855
BEFORE THAT TOWARD THE FINAL

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:14.957
YEARS OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:18.794
WERE ALREADY PATCHED HOLE IN. SO

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:19.762
IT IS THE- TO KNOW WHAT IS

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.631
WITHIN THE COLLEGES CONTROL TO

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:23.299
TRY TO INCREASE THEIR ENROLLMENT

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.234
LEVELS BECAUSE IT COULD BE THAT

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.036
JOBS ARE JUST VERY ATTRACTIVE

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:27.937
FOR THE POPULATION WHO

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:30.406
OTHERWISE. WOULD BE AND BUILDING

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.341
ON THE COLLEGE'S. AND WE ARE

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:35.044
ALSO TOLD THAT WHEN THE COLLEGES

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.479
HAD BEEN OFFERING THE SAME

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:39.248
COURSE IN PERSON ANDONLINE

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:41.384
THEIR WAIT LIST FOR THE ONLINE

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.818
ARE LONGER AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:45.288
OPENING UP MORE ONLINE. SO I

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:47.056
THINK SOME COLLEGES ARE TRYING

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:49.458
TO BE AS SENSITIVE TO STUDENT

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:52.228
DEMAND AS POSSIBLE. AND BECAUSE

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:54.330
COLLEGES GENERALLY ARE FACING

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.865
SUCH ENROLLMENT DECLINES ARE

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:58.067
STARTING TO BE MORE CREATIVE TO

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:00.303
TRY TO ATTRACT STUDENTS SO

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.904
THEY'RE STARTING TO DO SHORTER

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.040
TERMS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES SO

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:06.175
THAT MAYBE RATHER THAN A SIXTEEN

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.743
WEEK SEMESTER THEY MIGHT OFFER

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.812
SOMETHING FOR FOUR WEEKS. AND

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:10.880
THEY'RE STARTING TO DO THINGS

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:12.982
LIKE HAVE OPENED AN OPENING

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:14.350
DATES THAT AREN'T ALWAYS JUST

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:15.918
THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER THE

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.954
BEGINNING OF JANUARY WHERE YOU

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.189
COULD ENROLL A MID TERM AND

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:21.757
STILL GET A CERTIFICATE OR

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:24.760
COURSE CREDIT. SO THERE. ON AT

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:27.196
LEAST SOME OF THEM ARE TRYING TO

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:28.631
BE CREATIVE- BUT WHETHER IT'S

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:29.899
GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO EVER GET

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.901
BACK TO PRE PANDEMICS IS VERY

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:35.404
UNCERTAIN. AND WHETHER 50% OR

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.873
80% OR 20% IN PERSON IT'S

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.308
PROBABLY GOING TO VERY BY THE

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.577
PROGRAM HOW MUCH HANDS ON WORK

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.779
IS TYPICALLY REQUIRED. STUDENTS

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.348
LEVEL OF INTEREST YOU CAN

01:04:45.414 --> 01:04:46.582
IMAGINE VERY DIFFERENT

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:49.285
STRATEGIES FOR CULINARY ARTS AS

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.621
AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:55.291
IN ENGLISH OR MATHEMATICS. SO I

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:56.692
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:57.493
COLLEGES DO HAVE SOME

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.328
FLEXIBILITY TO SURVEY THEIR

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:00.463
STUDENTS FIGURE OUT THEIR

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.465
INTEREST DEVELOPED THERE- COURSE

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:05.401
OFFERINGS ACCORDINGLY AND THAT

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:06.769
WE CAN RECOGNIZE IT THERE ARE.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.004
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WITHIN

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.106
COLLEGES CONTROL AND THEN THINGS

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:15.278
LIKE THAT JOB. MARKET THAT ARE

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.445
OUTSIDE THEIR CONTROL. THANK YOU

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:17.747
AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS MUCH TO

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:19.682
PUT BLAME ON ANY JUST TO WHAT IT

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.817
IS WE AS A STATE NEED TO DO. TO

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:23.252
HELP BECAUSE IT IS A PROBLEM

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:24.153
THIS DIDN'T DECLINE IN

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.389
ENROLLMENT AND BOTH CAMPUSES AND

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:31.060

WHICH WAS COMPLETELY A TYPICAL

01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:53.747
FOR OUR INVOLVEMENT OBVIOUSLY WE

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.015

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:09.129
ON OUR- ON OUR INVOLVEMENT AT UC

01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:11.198

01:41:20.073 --> 01:41:22.309
THROUGH THAT FACT OF HAVING SO

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:23.544

AMOUNT OF- HOUSING INSECURITY

01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:58.344
THAT EXIST IN OUR SYSTEM. SO WE

01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:02.181
ARE WORKING HARD TO- WORK WITH-

01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:06.452
R. SEVENTY- THREE DISTRICTS TO

01:57:06.519 --> 01:57:08.121
COME UP WITH A COMMON WAY OF

01:57:08.187 --> 01:57:09.489
APPROACHING THIS IN TO BUILD THE

01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:10.923
INTERNAL CAPACITY TO HELP THE

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.892
SYSTEM. WHICH IS NOT

TRADITIONALLY- OVERSEEING

01:57:15.728 --> 01:57:18.231
STUDENT HOUSING BUT NOW- THERE

01:57:18.297 --> 01:57:19.565
IS A CONSENSUS THAT THIS IS THE

01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:21.100
DIRECTION WE NEED TO MOVE AND I

01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:23.736

BUILDING MORE STUDENT HOUSING.

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:44.157
IS HOW STUDENTS ACTUALLY PAY FOR

01:57:44.223 --> 01:57:45.258
THAT HOUSING AND CERTAINLY THE

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:46.292

02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:08.594
IS TO JUST THE THINGS THAT- JEFF

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:10.162
CASTRO MENTION THAT IS TO. LOOK

02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:15.848
