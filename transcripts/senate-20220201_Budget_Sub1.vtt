00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:36.842
QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:40.279
ITEM AND- OF AND I'M AND ASK A

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:40.946
COUPLE OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.015
DECIDING WHETHER THEY WANT TO

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:45.317
ASK AND- OF THE FIRST ONE

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:46.985
ACTUALLY RELATES TO COMMENT AT

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:49.187
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S JUST

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:52.658
MADE. BECAUSE LOCATION IS NOT

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.426
JUST TO LOOK AT NEXT YEAR'S

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:57.029
BUDGET BUT TO MONITOR THE IMPACT

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:58.664
IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.732
HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET.

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.834
AND EVEN THOUGH. FOR THE

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.336
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST JUST POINTED

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:06.572
OUT THE OBVIOUS THAT DID SOME

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:09.074
STATISTICS WON'T BE M. ON THE

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:10.342
COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OF

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.177
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM UNTIL THE

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:14.613
MAY REVISED I WAS GONNA ASK AT

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.848
LEAST TO STUDENT AID COMMISSION

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:19.084
AND OTHERS CAN COMMENT. ABOUT TO

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:21.286
WHAT- WHAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:24.489
TO IMPLEMENT IT HOW IT'S GOING

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:25.490
IF YOU FEEL THERE'S ANY

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.459
PROBLEMS. ARE JUST GIVE US AN

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:31.096
OVERVIEW OF WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:36.335
TO IMPLEMENT THAT THUS FAR. AND

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:37.302
I THINK WE'LL START WITH THE

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:39.538
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KRISTA

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:44.142
LOGICAL PERSON. WELL I WILL SAY

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:47.713
THAT- IMPLEMENTATION- IN

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:49.781
NOVEMBER OF THE REMAINING CAL

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.750
GRANT RECIPIENTS WERE L. R. FOR

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:54.920
THE ENTITLEMENT RECIPIENTS- THEY

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:58.023
WERE INITIALLY- ELIGIBLE BUT NOT

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.692
RECEIVING AWARDS AND IT DID TAKE

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:03.428
A MAJOR EFFORT TO GET THAT DONE

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:07.733
AND WHAT'S FOR US IS IT YOU KNOW

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.001
THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. I

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:11.670
BELIEVE THAT WE PLEASED WITH THE

00:21:11.737 --> 00:21:13.071
RESPONSE WITH THE NUMBER OF NEW

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:14.673
AWARDS I GOT DISTRIBUTED AND

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.141
SENT OUT TO THE COLLEGE

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:20.145
CAMPUSES- BY NOVEMBER AND- SO

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:23.815
FAR WE HAVE I THINK THAT THE

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:26.618
PAID RATE IS STILL BEING PROCESS

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:29.254
SO IT'S NOT A 100% YEAH BUT

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.223
WE'RE REALLY WORKING ACTIVELY TO

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:32.491
GET THAT PAID RATE TAKING CARE

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:33.592
OF SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.260
THE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS. WE

00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:37.195
CAN PROVIDE THE DETAILS I'M PAID

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:40.098
RATES AND- AND THE NUMBER OF

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:43.602
STUDENTS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:45.370
RECEIVED THEIR DISBURSEMENTS YOU

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:48.974
MEAN YOU CAN NOW ONE I HELP THAT

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:49.908
HAVE THAT DETAIL UNLESS MY

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.144
COLLEAGUES- JAKE HAS THAT

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.645
MOREOVER THE OTHER QUESTION IS

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:58.650
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RATES AND-

00:21:58.717 --> 00:21:59.384
CHANGING RATES DISSENT MEAN THAT

00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:00.652
. SOME PEOPLE BE AT ELIGIBLE FOR

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:02.888
RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS IF THE

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:04.222
RATES WERE IN PLACE BUT THEY

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:06.124
WERE NOT REALIZED AS THEY

00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.827
STARTED THE SCHOOL YEAR. SO WHAT

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:11.129
HAPPENS UNDER THE PREVIOUS-

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:14.166
COMPETITIVE GRANT- WE HAD A POOL

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:16.001
OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:18.537
STUDENTS. ARE JUST UNDER THREE

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:19.137
HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:21.573
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A CAL GRANT BUT

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.307
THEY WERE PLACED IN THE

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:24.376
COMPETITIVE POLE AND THEY'RE

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:25.944
ONLY FORTY ONE THOUSAND AWARDS

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.146
IN THAT COMPETITIVE POLE SO WHAT

00:22:28.213 --> 00:22:29.781
HAPPENED IS THERE'S ABOUT ONE IN

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:32.551
EIGHT STUDENTS WHO WAS ELIGIBLE

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:33.985
AND ACTUALLY GOT AN AWARD THE

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:34.953
REMAINING STUDENTS DIDN'T GET.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.657
AWARDS INSTITUTE IF THEY HAD GPA

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:40.692
. WERE A TO GET AWARDS AND SO

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:42.661
THE AWARDS THAT ARE OFFERED TO

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:44.396
THEM AND THE FINAL STEP IS FOR

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:45.864
THEM TO ACTUALLY WALK INTO THE

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:49.167
FINANCIAL AID OFFICE AND PICK UP

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:50.202
THEIR TAX. BILLS WILL BE

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:50.836
CONSIDERED BURNER HAS HIS HAND

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:52.871
UP BEFORE COLUMN YOU JUST SAID

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:55.040
ONE THING. HE SAID IF THEY HAVE

00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:57.909
GPAS. DOES THAT MEAN IF THEY

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:01.446
HAVE THEM AVAILABLE- IS THAT IT

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:03.181
DOES THAT MEAN AND I'M SORRY

00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:05.617
THIS IS THE- SPECIAL INTERESTS

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:08.053
QUESTION FROM SOMEBODY THAT WENT

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.654
TO A GRADE LAW SCHOOL. IF YOU

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:11.356
WANT TO A PASS NO CREDIT SCORE

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:13.458
AND YOU HAVE NO GRIP. DO NOT

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:17.462
QUALIFY FOR GRANT. I THAT'S A

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:19.264
TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT I KNOW I

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:21.166
KNOW YOU WILL QUALIFY FOR CAL

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.768
GRANTS BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:24.836
TO DETERMINE THE GPA AND I'M NOT

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.673

YOU KNOW THUS FAR- FOR THE

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:34.619
IMPLEMENTATION AND ANY CHANGE IN

00:27:34.686 --> 00:27:36.521
THE PROGRAM OR ANY PROBLEMS AND

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:37.722
WE'LL START WITH THE EXECUTIVE

DIRECTOR AND THEN I WILL GO TO

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:44.429
MISTER BREMER. AFTER THAT. SO WE

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.931
HAVE STARTED CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:48.967
THE SEGMENTS TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:51.403
DETAILS AS WE KNOW THEM IN THE

00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:52.270
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FROM LAST

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.273
FROM LAST. AND WE BEGUN TRYING

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.508
TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WOULD

00:27:56.574 --> 00:27:58.643
WORK IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE CAL

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.944
GRANT PROGRAMS BECAUSE THERE IS

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:01.379
AN OVERLAY WITH THE CAL GRANT

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:03.548
PROGRAMS SO IT'S MIDDLE CLASS

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:06.618
SCHOLARSHIP PLUS. IN THE CURRENT

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:08.353
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.889
. STUDENTS WHO ARE HIGHER INCOME

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.524
THAN THE ELIGIBLE CAL GRANT

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.691
SEASONS ARE THE ONES WHO GET

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:15.126
AWARDS AND NOW WITH THE NEW

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:18.029
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP- UC AND

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:22.000
CSU STUDENTS. WHO WHO- RECEIVER

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:24.569
CAL GRANT AS WELL AS STUDENTS

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:25.904
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THE

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.173
FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN TWO

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:29.541
HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR ARE ALSO

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:30.708
ELIGIBLE SO IT'S BEEN GREATLY

00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:32.844
EXPANDED. SO THE DETAILS THAT

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.712
WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW YOU

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:36.648
ACTUALLY DETERMINE THAT CUSTOMER

00:28:36.714 --> 00:28:38.483
TENDONS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.086
BASED ON. THE COST OF ATTENDANCE

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:44.089
AND THAT THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:45.657
SCHOLARSHIP WOULD BE THEIR LAST

00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:49.494
DOLLAR IT. STUDENT. SENATE

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.897
OFFICERS WOULD- ADDRESS THE-

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:54.399
FINANCIAL. PROGRAMS THAT

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.301
STUDENTS ARE. FOR PACKAGES AND

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:58.269
WHATEVER REMAINS THAT'S WHERE

00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:00.004
THE STATE WOULD COME IN AND USE

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.873
MIDDLE CLASS ADULTS SCHOLARSHIP

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.476
TO CLOSE THE UNMET NEED GAP. AND

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.111
AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE FUNDING

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:08.580
LEVEL THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED WE

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:09.481
CAN CLOSE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:11.716
PERCENT. OF THAT OF THE UNMET

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:15.286
NEED GAP. AND AND THERE'S

00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:16.254
DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN.

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:18.123
IMPLEMENT SO THOSE ARE THE

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:19.624
ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE

00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:22.193
OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.262
BY. WE'VE YOU GO TO THE L. A-

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:26.664
THING WHEN YOU SAY YOU CAN MEET

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.166
TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. OF THE

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:30.135
UNMET NEED GAP. DOES IT MEAN

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:32.537
THERE 76% UNDERDRESSED AT THAT

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:35.907
POINT. THE FUNDING WOULD COVER

00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:37.609
CORRECT IT'S ONLY THAT THE

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:39.210
CURRENT FUNDING IN THE BUDGET

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:40.512
PROPOSAL WHICH COVER

00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:43.248
APPROXIMATELY 24% OF WHAT WE

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:45.316
ANTICIPATE THE FULL COST OF

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:46.851
IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:48.686
OVERSEE YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS

00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:51.089
AND WHEN YOU SAY THE FULL COST

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:52.390
OF IMPLEMENTING THAT'S REALLY

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:55.193
STAFF. AND THAT'S WITH THIS ITEM

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.961
MORE TALK ABOUT RIGHT WERE THERE

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:57.929
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE N THE

00:29:57.996 --> 00:30:03.334
COSTS OF IMPLEMENTATION. ARE NOT

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.469
BUYING A DRESS STORE BY THE

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:05.136
BUDGET. WELL THE STAFFING THIS

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:07.205
IS ISSUE I'M REFERRING TO BEING

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:08.540
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE MIDDLE CLASS

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:11.476
SCHOLARSHIP CRAFT FENDI. HASH IN

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.144
THE GRANT TO PASS A WRECKED

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.079
ASSISTANCE. CORRECT THAT'S WHAT

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:17.248
THIS MEANS FOR YOU TO NOW OKAY

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.017
JUST TRYING TO CLEAR THAT UP BUT

00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.185
I INTERRUPTED YOU WHEN YOU WERE

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:24.422
GOING TO GO ON TO SOMETHING

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:25.557
ABOUT THE L. A. O. RIGHT THE L.

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:26.858
A. O. POINTED OUT THAT. THERE

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:28.326
ARE SOME YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:29.394
COMPLEXITIES WITH IMPLEMENTATION

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.161
THAT WE'RE REALLY STARTING

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:31.930
THROUGH RIGHT NOW. AND WE THINK

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.565
THAT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:35.099
CAN REALLY STREAMLINED SO THAT

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:36.367
WE CAN GET THE FUNDS OUT AS

00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:38.269
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE WE

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.437
KNOW THAT STUDENTS ARE IN DIRE

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:41.539
NEED NOW. SO WE'RE REALLY

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.741
LOOKING AT VARIOUS OPTIONS-

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:45.610
PROBABLY TWO OF THE MOST COMPLEX

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.278
ISSUES THAT WE THINK WARRANT

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.247
SOME CONSIDERATION AND WE REALLY

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:50.949
WANT TO HAVE A ROBUST

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:52.150
CONVERSATION WITH THE DIFFERENT

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:54.619
STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS QUESTION.

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:58.623
CLEAN OF LEADS SENATE STAFF.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.492
REALLY GET SOME INPUT. SHE ALL

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.927
ONE- RIGHT NOW MIDDLE CLASS.

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.395
REQUIRES THAT THIS BE THE LAST

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:05.964
DOLLAR TO PROVIDE IN THE

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.466
STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE.

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.435
THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:12.370
IMPLEMENT AND THE SEGMENTS HAVE

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:14.038
REALLY SPOKEN OUT QUITE A BIT

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:15.540
IT'S MUCH EASIER TO IMPLEMENT

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:17.175
IT. AS PART OF THE OVERALL

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:20.178
PACKAGING SO THAT YOU CAN KIND

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:22.614
OF RELY ON THE SPECIFIED AMOUNT.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.349
BECAUSE LAST DOLLAR THAT AMOUNT

00:31:24.415 --> 00:31:26.951
VARIES IT'S A MOVING TARGET. AND

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:29.053
SO WHAT ARE THE IDEAS TO MAKE IT

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.322
EASIER AND STAFF NOT JUST FOR

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.791
THE- BUT ALL. FINANCIAL

00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:35.693
ADMINISTRATORS EMPLOY. A

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.596
SEAMLESS WAS BE TO MAKE AN EARLY

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:40.665
. FIRST THAT MEANS YOU KNOW AND

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:46.204
THEN TO ALSO HAVE A DEFINED.

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:47.705
THAT YOU COULD GO BACK INTO YOUR

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:49.741
PACKAGING SO ARE TWO ISSUE THAT

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:50.842
WE REALLY. BUDGET CONTINUE JUST

00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:52.377
AND HEAR FROM THE ARCHITECTS OF

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:53.945
THE PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:55.446
SEGMENTS IN TERMS OF AN

00:31:55.513 --> 00:31:57.749
IMITATION WERE PREPARED TO

00:31:57.815 --> 00:32:00.385
FACILITATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS-

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:01.819
OKAY SO WE'VE ALREADY STARTED

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:03.388
BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:05.223
THAT WE'RE ZEROING IN ON. THANK

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.225

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.411
BUT I THINK REALLY REFLECT WHERE

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:27.812
WE ARE IMPLEMENTATION AND SOME

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:29.914
OF THE KEY CHALLENGES- THAT WERE

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:31.582
CONSIDERING TRYING TO WORK

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:32.250

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.633
BEEN FOR THEM TO ACCESS

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.068
FINANCIAL AID HOW COMPLICATED IS

00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:18.302
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:19.704
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BOTH IN THE

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.039
L. A. R. O. REPORT- AS WELL AS

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:24.041
AS SOME OF THE OTHER MATERIALS-

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:25.876
WE RECEIVED AND ALSO I THINK IN

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:27.244
IN SEVERAL YOUR TESTIMONIES.

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:28.846
IT'S I GUESS MY QUESTION IS YOU

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:32.416
KNOW DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:35.786
SCALE- WITH WHICH THIS

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:38.055
COMPLEXITY IS A PROBLEM LIKE IN

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:40.224
OTHER WORDS- HOW MANY STUDENTS

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:41.759
ARE PREVENTEDEVERYTHING FROM

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:44.395
ACCESS AND CAL GRANT WE HAVE

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:45.830
SOME SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:47.164
PROBLEM. AND DO WE HAVE. IT

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:48.899
IDENTIFY RECORD. MEANS TO REDUCE

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:50.968
THIS COMPLEXITY. THERE'S

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:53.638
STREAMLINING OR OTHERWISE- YOU

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:54.405
KNOW SO I GUESS THAT THAT WOULD

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.107
BE MY QUESTION I THINK FOR C.

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:58.275
SACK AND THEN AND PERHAPS FOR

00:37:58.342 --> 00:37:59.377
ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO TAKE ON

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:08.686
THAT QUESTION. LET'S GO TO- I'LL

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:11.155
TAKE A STAB AT THAT QUESTION-

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:14.058
REALLY THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:15.559
NAVIGATING THE FINANCIAL AID

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:18.362
SYSTEM IS REALLY ONE OF THE CORE

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:19.330
PRINCIPLES BEHIND CAL GRANT

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:23.134
REFORM AND WHAT LED US TO- DOING

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.403
THE WORK IT WAS A OF ONE YEAR

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.471
WORK GROUP THAT WE CONVENE

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:29.073
LOOKING AT ALL THE OBSTACLES FOR

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.842
STUDENTS. YOU ACCESS FINANCIALLY

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.611
AND IT IS DEFINITELY A BARRIER

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:36.414
PARTICULARLY FOR FIRST

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.648
GENERATION LOW INCOME SO

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:41.986
SPINELLI. AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:43.320
THE GUYS PRINCIPLE THAT WE NEED

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.855
TO MAKE THIS A USER FRIENDLY

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:46.557
THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS BUILT

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:48.225
IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE FOR VERY

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:50.027
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND OVER

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:52.096
THE YEARS. WE ADDED A LOT OF

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.331
LAYERS TO THE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:56.267
VARIOUS MEANS THIS IS THE FIRST

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.202
TIME THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:00.971
ATTEMPTED TO REDESIGN THE CAL

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.840
GRANT BASED ON TODAY'S STUDENTS

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:05.843
NEEDS SO THAT'S WHY WE TAKE

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:06.877
EIGHT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CAL

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:07.978
GRANT PROGRAMS THAT'S WHAT WE

00:39:08.045 --> 00:39:10.181
HAVE NOW. AND WE REALLY NARROW

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:12.283
IT DOWN TO TWO PROGRAMS CAL

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:13.651
GRANT TO FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:39:13.718 --> 00:39:15.753
STUDENTS WITH ONE SET OF

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.588
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND CAL

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:20.057
GRANT FOR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:21.258
AND ONE SET OF ELIGIBILITY

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.861
REQUIREMENTS. RIGHT NOW IT

00:39:23.928 --> 00:39:25.029
STUDENT APPLIES FOR FINANCIAL

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:26.931
AID THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHICH OF

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:28.866
THE EIGHT PROGRAMS ARE PLANNED

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:29.900
FOR ALL WITH DIFFERENT

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:32.470
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. AND

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:34.638
WHAT ONE OF BUT WE'RE REALLY

00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.707
HOPING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS CAL

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:38.676
GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK IS THAT

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:40.044
WE EMPOWER STUDENTS AND FAMILIES

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:42.146
NO I'M APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:45.116
AID THIS IS WHAT I'M APPLYING

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.584
FOR HERE ARE THE REQUIREMENTS.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.120
AND TO BE ABLE TO BE INTENTIONAL

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:50.888
IN THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:51.989
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO GO TO

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.791
COLLEGE ABOUT WHAT THE COST OF

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.893
GOING TO COLLEGE ARE SO THAT'S A

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.829
HUGE PART OF OPENING ACCESS.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:00.664
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE FAMILIES

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:04.635
THAT RULE THEM. THIS THEY'RE NOT

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:06.670
. OR THAT WE CANNOT CALL. AND WE

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.072
BELIEVE WILL GOAL. WAY IN THEM

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:10.040
ARMENIAN WITH THE IN. EARLY ON

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:11.842
THAT SAY. GET HAVING TO

EVENTUALLY A LOOK UP TABLE THAT

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:14.912
SAYS I MAKE THIS AMOUNT OF

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:17.214
MONEY. THEREFORE I AM ELIGIBLE

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:19.416
FOR THIS AMOUNT OF SPENDING AND

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:20.851
WE THINK THAT'LL BE POWERFUL FOR

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.686
THOSE FIRST GENERATION FAMILIES

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.789
AND THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:27.191
START LIMIT LET ME REPHRASE THAT

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:30.561
BECAUSE MAYBE I DO IT WILL- X. A

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:32.763

WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:41.872

KNOW I CLEARLY THE PROBLEM AND

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.546
JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE OF LIKE.

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:50.047
DO WE KNOW HOW BIG THE PROBLEM

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:52.183
IS TO INTERVIEWS WITH STUDENTS

00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:54.618
THROUGH SURVEYS- AND THEN

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:57.087

CAN SHOW WHO WHO'S NOT GETTING

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:20.744
AN AWARD THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:21.946
GET IN A WORD AFTER CAL GRANT.

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:26.083

HEAT MESSAGE TALK THE NEED TO

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.077
CONSIDER THIS IS PART THE BUDGET

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:42.780
BY HE ALSO X. THAT- ANOTHER KEY

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:46.250
READ. ONE FIFTY SIX WERE HIS

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.751
BELIEF I PRESUME IN FOR BY

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:48.952
ANALYSIS THE X. BRANCH THAT-

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:51.355
THIS WOULD RESULT IN UNTENABLE

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:54.958
COST PRESSURES TO THE STATE- DO

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.693
YOU STILL THINK THAT THIS IS

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.898
TRUE- AND IF NOT SORT OF WHAT'S

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:03.167
CHANGE THAT THAT MIGHT- YOU

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:04.034
KNOW. ESSENTIALLY WITH THEIR

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:05.235
FARMS HERE LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:08.005
THE ONES PROPOSING FOURTEEN

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:09.039
FIFTY SIX INSIDERS WONDERING SIR

00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:10.841
WHAT WHAT WHAT THE REASON FOR

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:11.775
THE CHANGES OTHER THAN THE

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:14.244
BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE- OUT YOU

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:15.379
KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:16.313
SIGNIFICANT CAUGHT. LAST YEAR I

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:21.218
AM NOT SURE YOU MEAN. I THINK

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.554
THERE ARE TWO ISSUES. THAT THAT

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.124
WE NEED TO ADDRESS ONE IS- THIS

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:28.258
YOU NEED COMMISSION AND

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:29.793
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.296
HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF DATA

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:34.531
THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH IN

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:36.667
TERMS OF WHAT I BELIEVE THE COST

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:41.438
PRESSURE WORK WE HAVE- TO COME

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:42.473
AND HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT COST

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:46.777
PRESSURE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.645
OTHER THE LAST. REALLY A LINE ON

00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:50.514
THE COSTS PRESSURES TO START

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:53.584
WITH A THE SAME- BASED WEIGHT

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:57.654
COSTS AND- AND SO WE'VE DONE

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.990
THAT AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:01.425
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE TO PASS

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:04.728
CATCHERS THAT- JAKE EARLIER BUT

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:08.265
IT IS. SOMETHING THAT WERE IN

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:09.867
LINE WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:12.569
. THIS IS ISSUE IS THAT IT'S OUR

00:46:12.636 --> 00:46:15.873
BELIEF THAT. THEY AB FOURTEEN

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:16.940
FIFTY SIX THE BIGGEST COST

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:19.776
PRESSURE OF AB FOURTEEN FIFTY

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:21.512
SIX REALLY WAS CAL GRANT IN

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:22.045
TITLE MEANT FOR COMMUNITY

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:24.615
COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO WHEN THAT

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:26.550
WILL BE DRESSED IN THE BUDGET

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:27.885
YEAH REALLY JUST LEFT THE

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:30.120
REMAINING COMPACT AND PULL FOR

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:32.222
THE FOR INSTITUTIONS EIGHTEEN.

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:34.558
AND STREET WHO IS A TEN COLLEGE

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:36.560
BEYOND WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF HIGH

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.995
SCHOOL IF THEY'RE GOING TO YOU

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:43.767
THE CSU. CALLER HE TO THAT

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:45.536
COMPARE PULL SOME TO THE CALL

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:46.770
COMPETITORS PULL ALBEIT AS LONG

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:48.438
AS IT WOULD READ THOSE BARRIERS

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:50.307
BRING THEM INTO THE ENTITLEMENT

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:52.242
MIX AS WELL SO THAT ALL STUDENTS

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:54.011
IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU DECIDE TO

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:55.779
START COLLEGE AT TWENTY TWO MORE

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.414
THAN A YEAR OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:00.217
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO COMPETE FOR

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:02.152
A VERY LIMITED PULL CAL GRANT

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:08.625
SHE WOULD GET A CAL GRANT. SO

00:47:08.692 --> 00:47:11.895
THOSE COSTS. IN THE WAY. TO YOUR

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:14.398
MANAGE THESE COSTS AND- BUT AT

00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:15.899
THE SAME TIME PROVIDE THE

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:18.402
PREDICTABILITY AND THE ASSURANCE

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:20.103
TO FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS IN

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.638
PARTICULAR BUT LOW INCOME

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:23.707
STUDENTS. IN ALL OVER ALL THAT

00:47:23.774 --> 00:47:25.509
THEY CAN AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:27.511
AND THIS IS WHAT IT COSTS. BUT

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:29.379
BUT WE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS WE

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:31.715

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO LET ME

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.564
GO TO REBEKAH KIRK. I THINK

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:49.399
SHE'S GOING TO ANSWER YOUR

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:51.335
QUESTION GOT SERVICE THANK.

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.738
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM JUST

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:57.241
WANTING CHECK TO CLARIFY WE ARE

00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:58.709
HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:00.444
STUDENT AID COMMISSION ABOUT THE

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.346
MOST RECENT PROPOSAL HOWEVER

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.681
WE'VE NOT YET SEEN. ANY DETAIL

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:07.117
OR SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FOR THIS

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:08.652
YEAR'S VERSION OF THE PROPOSAL

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.454
THAT WE HAVE NOT YET HAD AN

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.822
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:14.491
DETAILS OR TO CONDUCT OUR OWN

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:16.193
FISCAL ANALYSIS AND WHAT'S BEING

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.263
PROPOSED AT THIS. I WOULD JUST.

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:20.464
SPEAKING HAS THE CAL GRANT

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.566
PROGRAM IS AN ENTITLEMENT AND

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:23.900
EXPANSION OF ENTITLEMENT

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:26.303
PROGRAMS BEYOND WHAT WE'VE

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.638
ALREADY SEEN AS A SIGNIFICANT

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:29.606
EXPANSION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:31.942
ONE BUDGET ACT AT THE EXPANSION

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:33.810
IN TITLE MEANT CAN BE

00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:35.412
CONSIDERABLY COSTLY. THERE'S

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:36.146
ALSO A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:37.848
UNCERTAINTY INVOLVED BECAUSE IT

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:39.983
IS AN ENTITLEMENT EVEN IF THERE

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.852
IS A PROJECTED COST AT A CERTAIN

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:43.420
LEVEL THAT CAN FLUCTUATE

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:45.522
SIGNIFICANTLY AS CASELOAD

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.558
INCREASES OR DECREASES OVER TIME

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:50.060
SO FROM FROM THE FINANCE

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:52.329
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THE

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:54.164
EXPANDING ENTITLEMENTS AS ALWAYS

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:56.867
A SOMEWHAT RISKY AND A CONCERN

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:58.702
FOR US BECAUSE IT LIMITS

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:01.738
BUDGETARY FLEXIBILITY AS WELL AS

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:02.606

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:18.922
THAT CAN MAKE THAT STUDENT

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:19.856
COMMISSION IS PREPARED TO

ADDRESS FROM A FINANCE

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.259
PERSPECTIVE WE CAN NOT BECAUSE

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:24.194
WE'VE NOT YET SEEN A SPECIFIC

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:25.062

THESE TWO PROGRAMS WITH THE

CLOSE TO SEE WHAT THAT IS-

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:51.648
OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BE FISCALLY

RUN. AND I THINK ONE OF THE

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:07.764
REASONS IN MY VIEW- THE

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:09.533
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN SO RESILIENT

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:11.101

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.016
UNIVERSITIES HAVE SOME OF THE

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:02.052
LOWEST DEBT IN THE NATION UPON

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:05.822
GRADUATION. AND IT GOES ON TO

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:08.058
SAY THAT IN NINETEEN NINETY. TWO

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:09.426
THOUSAND NINETEEN AND 2046% OF

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.861
THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GRADUATES

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.629
HAVE A STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AND

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:14.231
THE AVERAGE LOAN DEBT OF THE

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:18.535
CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GRADUATE. IN

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:19.069
NINETEEN TWENTY TO TWENTY

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.403
NINETEEN I'M SORRY TWENTY

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.672
NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. WAS

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:23.306
TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:24.574
AND TWENTY FIVE. PLACING THE

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:27.077
STATE THIRD LOWEST IN THE NATION

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:30.180
ON THIS MEASURE- I JUST WANT TO

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:33.049
SAY THAT- THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:35.385
PROUD OF I MEAN IT I KNOW THAT

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:36.486
WE STILL HAVE SOME CHALLENGES.

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:40.323
WE'LL FOR. MAKING COLLEGE- MORE

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.291
AFFORDABLE FOR MANY OF OUR

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:42.893
STUDENTS BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:44.728
REALLY GOOD PROGRESS I THINK IN

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.730
A VERY POSITIVE PERSPECTIVE IN

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.532
MY OPINION. ON THAT AND I THINK

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:50.934
IT- WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AND

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:52.502
ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:54.104
COMMENDED. THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:57.541
BEEN TESTED- MADE AN EFFORT TO

00:52:57.607 --> 00:52:58.675
CREATE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE

00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:03.513
IN THIS CALIFORNIA. SO ON THAT-

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.648
I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:06.683
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE- MIDDLE

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.185
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP- WHAT ARE THE

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:10.520
OVERALL DIFFERENCES IN THE

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:11.721
IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES

00:53:11.788 --> 00:53:13.189
BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS AND THE NEW

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:15.792
VERSIONS OF. OF THIS GRANT AND

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:18.528
THEN FROM THERE. AB I'M GOING TO

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:22.933
WANT O KNOW. IF- THE C. S. A.

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:25.135
C. I BELIEVE THAT ANY STATURE

00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:27.304
TERRY STATUTORY CHANGES ARE

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.340
NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM IN

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:32.442
EMPLOYMENT IN THE CHANGES. I

00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:34.244
THINK WE'LL GO TO WHO ARE WITH

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:35.445
GOING TO ASK WHICH ONE AND THAT

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:38.281
ANSWERS THIS QUESTION MR BREMNER

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:39.516
HAS HIS HAND UP SO LET'S GO TO

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:42.385
HIM. SURE AND SENATOR THIS IS A

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:44.054
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.789
STRUCTURE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:46.723
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM IN A COUPLE

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:50.527
OF KEY- REGARDS. THE FIRST IS

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:51.995
THAT THE- CURRENT MIDDLE CLASS

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.363
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAT WE'RE

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.165
PAYING OUT THIS YEAR. IS STILL

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.666
ONE THAT'S BASED ON COVERING UP

00:53:56.733 --> 00:53:58.768
PERCENTAGE OF TUITION. FOR

00:53:58.835 --> 00:53:59.836
STUDENTS THAT DO NOT RECEIVE A

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.938
CAL GRANT. SO THAT'S A SMALLER

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.340
UNIVERSE OF TOTAL STUDENTS THAT

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:05.909
WE SERVE. AND IT'S- I NEVER

00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:07.677
WANED RANGE AND THE TYPES OF

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:08.511
AWARDS THAT WE PROVIDE TO

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:11.114
STUDENTS. AGAIN JUST BASED ON

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:12.315
THAT PERCENTAGE OF TUITION

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:16.319
COVERAGE FOR NON CALTRAIN

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:17.921
RECIPIENTS. AND THE NEW

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:23.126
STRUCTURE BEEN. HELLO THE

00:54:23.193 --> 00:54:24.327
GOVERNOR'S. WE WOULDN'T BE

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:25.895
SERVED ALL AND FAMILIES HELLO

00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:27.330
CERTAIN INCOME BUT A RECEIPT

00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:29.132
CALTRAIN OR NOT. AND THE TARGET

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:31.835
OF THE AWARD WOULD BE. UNMET

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:33.503
NEED FOR A STUDENT TO COVER

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.572
THEIR TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:37.007
AFTER FACTORING IN THE OTHER

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:38.575
FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID FOR WHICH

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:41.444
THEY QUALIFY. A STUDENT

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.712
CONTRIBUTION THAT'S CONSISTENT

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:44.414
ACROSS ALL STUDENTS IN THE

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:47.017
PROGRAM. AS WELL AS FOR FAMILIES

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.818
WITH INCOMES OVER ONE HUNDRED

00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:50.220
THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ADDITIONAL

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:52.355
PARENTAL CONTRIBUTION. WHAT THIS

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:53.423
MEANS IS THAT THERE ARE

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.825
ADDITIONAL METRICS WE NEED TO BE

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:58.094
ABLE TO INCORPORATE AND HOW WE

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.429
DO THIS AT THIS DO NEED

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:01.064
COMMISSION AND IDENTIFY THE

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:02.132
AWARD AMOUNTS FOR EACH OF OUR

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:04.701
POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS. AS I NOTED

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:06.036
EARLIER WE NEED TO KNOW THE

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.804
TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM AND

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:09.706
WHAT THE TOTAL COST OF

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:10.407
ATTENDANCE IS FOR ALL OF THE

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.208
STUDENTS WOULD BE RECIPIENTS. WE

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:13.576
CAN ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S THE

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:14.944
ANNUAL APPROPRIATION TOWARDS

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:19.983
THIS PROGRAM. FOR WHICH WE CAN

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.051
PRO RATE THE WAR- CAN. ACROSS

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:22.552
ALL RECEIVE OF THE CURRENT

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:23.887
STRUCK. AND WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:25.055
ALL OF THE OTHER FORMS OF

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:25.922
FINANCIAL AID FOR WHICH THE

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.291
RECEDING SO WE CAN IDENTIFY

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:30.093
UNMET NEED GAP FOR EACH OF THE

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:37.200
STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM. SO THAT. CERTAINLY HAS X. THE NUMBER OF

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:38.068
STUDENTS WE WOULD SEE BECAUSE

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:39.102
FROM ABOUT. FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.270
AND THIS KERR PROGRAM. THAT

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:42.038
WOULD IN JUST THREE SIXTY

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.273
THOUSAND AND THE NEXT ITERATION

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:45.108
OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE WILL BE

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:45.608
IMPLEMENTING IN THE NEXT

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:48.511
ACADEMIC YEAR. IT ALSO. MEANS A

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:49.979
MORE COMPLICATED WORK

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:51.815
INDIVIDUALIZED SET OF AWARDS FOR

00:55:51.881 --> 00:55:53.583
EACH STUDENT PARTICIPATION. SO

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.085
THAT'S CHANGE THE-

00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:56.419
CONSIDERATIONS WE CAN MAKE

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:57.787
AROUND HOW UNDER ITS CURRENT

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.255
STRUCTURE WILL BE ABLE TO INFORM

00:55:59.322 --> 00:56:00.724
STUDENTS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:01.891
AWARD AMOUNT THAT THEY CAN

00:56:01.958 --> 00:56:03.760
ANTICIPATE RECEIVING. BECAUSE

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:04.661
IT'S NOT REALLY MUCH MORE

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:06.663
INDIVIDUALIZED FOR EACH STUDENT

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.198
IS RECEIVING AN AWARD BASED ON

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:09.999
THEIR COST OF ATTENDANCE AND

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:10.900
THEIR OTHER FORMS OF AID FOR

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.869
WHICH THEY RECEIVED. SO I THINK

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:13.837
THAT COULD HAVE DIRECTOR GARCIA

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.138
NOTED WE DO THINK THERE ARE A

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:17.073
COUPLE OF TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.007
THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.576
STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT WOULD

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:21.177
HELP US STILL MOVE FORWARD IN

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:23.012
MPLEMENTING WHICH IN THIS

00:56:23.079 --> 00:56:24.380
CURRENT APPROPRIATION. MIGHT

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:27.217
ALLOW US TO PROVIDE. A CLEAR

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:29.219
PICTURE TO STUDENTS EARLIER

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:33.723
ABOUT THE- PROTECTION YOU SEE.

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.525
PREACHING FROM THE LAST ALL ARE

OF STUDENTS HOW MUCH OF AN AWARD

YOU WANT TO SEND TO EACH OF

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:43.399
THOSE STUDENTS. RATHER THAN

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:45.635
GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS-

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:46.903
FIGURING OUT ALL OF THEIR OTHER

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.705
FORMS OF AGE FIRST. AND THEN

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.206
WHAT THE YOUNG MAN NEED GAP IS

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:51.207
AND WE THINK THAT YOU COULD

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:52.342
STILL DO THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:54.110
PROCESS IN SUCH A WAY THAT STAYS

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:55.745
WITHIN. THE APPROPRIATIONS

00:56:55.812 --> 00:57:00.450
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AND- HAS

MIGHT BE RECEIVING FROM THE

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:58.601
CAMPUS. AND THEN WHAT IS THE-

00:58:58.668 --> 00:59:01.204
HOW. THIS PROGRAM- IN THE STATE

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:02.739
BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT NOW THERE

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:04.707
IS A PROPOSED APPROPRIATION OF A

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:06.309
TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED THIRTY TWO

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:07.744
MILLION FOR WHICH WE KNOW

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:08.845
THERE'S- A BROAD LEGISLATIVE

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:11.381
SUPPORT- THAT MEANS THAT IT'S

00:59:11.447 --> 00:59:12.815
NOT A FINAL APPROPRIATION AND WE

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:14.417
DON'T HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL DATA

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:16.085
FROM OUR CAMPUSES. AROUND WHAT

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:18.087
THE AID PACKAGE LOOKS LIKE. SO

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:20.223
WE COULD IDENTIFY- INITIAL

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.624
PROJECTED THE WORDS BUT THOSE

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:23.126
WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:24.427
BASED ON THE FUNDING AMOUNTS

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.396
RECEIVED AND CHANGES TO OUR

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:27.430
STUDENTS FINANCES OVER THE

00:59:27.497 --> 00:59:29.165
COURSE OF AN ACADEMIC YEAR. AND

00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:29.966
TO THE CHANGES IN THEIR

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:31.100
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE OVER THE

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:32.802
COURSE OF AN ACADEMIC YEAR. I'M

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:34.070
BECAUSE OF HIS LAST DOLLAR

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:35.672
NATURE OF THE PROGRAM AWARDS CAN

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.573
CHANGE FOR STUDENTS. EVEN IN THE

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.042
COURSE OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR THAT

00:59:39.108 --> 00:59:41.144
THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED. WE HAD

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.445
A SIMILAR PROGRAM THOUGH IN A

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:45.081
MUCH- MORE REDUCED CO WHEN WE

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:46.416
WERE FIRST IMPLEMENTING THE

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:48.184
CURRENT MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:49.585
PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES JUST ON

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:52.422

FOR MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP-

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.431

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.248
SOMETHING WE CAN TAKE BACK FOR

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.450

COMMENT HERE MENTIONED HAVE YOU

WERE JUST THIS AND I REALLY.

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:59.255
THAT THAT'S GAVEL DOWN THE TENTH

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.297
WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO CONTINUE

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:09.565
TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:11.100
IS VERY IMPORTANT WE STILL HAVE

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.636
FOUR. ITEMS ON THE AGENDA AND

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:14.904
LET ME JUST MAKE A SUMMARY

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:18.174
COMMENT WHICH IS THAT I THINK

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:21.177
THE STAFF'S. ARE CHARGED AT THE

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:23.146
BEGINNING OF THE BUDGET IN THE

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:25.148
THREE YEAR EXENDITURES MENTIONS

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:27.116
PART OF THE CASE VERY WELL WHICH

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:29.118
IS SAID. WE REALLY MADE

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.820
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES LAST YEAR TO

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:33.656
ADD ACCESS. IN THE GOVERNOR IS

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:36.726
PROPOSING GOING SOMEWHAT MORE IT

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.461
IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET IN THE

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:42.865
NEXT YEAR. AND YET WE ALSO WANT

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:46.069
IN MAY TO HAVE REALLY DETAILED

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:49.105
OUR DATA. ON THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:50.940
OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR SO WE

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:53.776
CAN JUDGE IT IN OUR FINAL

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:57.246
DECISIONS. AND I THINK SPEAKING

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:59.649
FOR MYSELF I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:01.551
WHAT CENTRO CULTURAL BOGUE

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:05.088
POINTED OUT ABOUT THE- WHO DEBT

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.389
BEING LOWER IN CALIFORNIA

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:07.924
COMPARED TO SOME OTHER STATES

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:10.893
BUT WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.328
AND APPRECIATE WHERE THE

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.729
GOVERNOR'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:16.365
ENTITLEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME.

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:19.168
IF I HAVE A BROTHER WHO HAD

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.603
THREE KIDS THAT WENT TO COLLEGE

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.805
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND IT AND

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.107
HE WAS JUST HANGING BY HIS

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.975
FINGERNAILS FINANCIALLY ALL THE

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:28.344
WAY THROUGH. AND I THINK THAT

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.113
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.948
ACCESS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:34.050
GET AS CLOSE TO A DEBT FREE

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:36.252
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AS WE CAN.

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:38.754
AND THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK NOT

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:41.824
JUST AT THE IMPLEMENTATION AND

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.392
VERY IMPORTANTLY LOOK AT THE

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:45.027
SIMPLIFICATION IN A WAY THAT IT

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.462
DOESN'T SCREEN PEOPLE OUT OF THE

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:49.031
PROCESS. AT THE SAME TIME WE

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:49.899
HAVE TO LOOK GOING FORWARD AT

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:53.302
THE GAPS AND DO OUR BEST TO MEET

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:56.706
THEM WHETHER IT'S THROUGH

01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:58.207
LEGISLATION. TO THAT WE THE

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.976
BUDGET. AND I THINK DISC HAS

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:02.345
BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL TO THOSE

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:05.047
DIFFERENT ISSUES AND WE WANT TO

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.049
LOOK AT THE DATA AS IT CONTINUES

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:09.719
TO COME IN. AND THEN I'LL WORK

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:11.554
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.422
ASSEMBLY TO TRY TO MEET THOSE

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:15.391
GOALS IN WATER WE CRAFTED MAY

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:18.294
AND JUNE AND- AND I REALLY FEEL

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:19.629
LIKE WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:22.665
FOREVER. BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:25.134
AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS MANY OF

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.502
THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN THIS

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:28.171
COMMITTEE IT WILL MAKE A

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:28.704
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:31.207
PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND THE ABILITY

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:32.842
TO ENTER THE ECONOMY IN A GOOD

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:35.611
WAY. AND IF WE COULD EVER GET ON

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:36.379
WITH THE DRESSING THE HOUSING

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:37.813
ISSUE. THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.849
SO INDEBTED FROM COLLEGE THAT

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.717
THEY WERE EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:43.486
GETTING INTO THE HOUSING MARKET

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.054
SO ALL THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WE

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.822
WANT TO LOOK AT I THINK AND

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:48.991
CONSIDER GOING FORWARD AND- I

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.726
APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:55.031

01:25:57.585 --> 01:25:58.720
EQUIVALENT STUDENTS LOWER THAN

01:25:58.786 --> 01:26:03.358
THEY WERE. PREVIOUSLY. WHAT HE

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:06.828
STANDS FOR THE LEGISLATORS AMONG

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:07.929
THE GROWTH TARGET FOR TWENTY

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:08.963
TWENTY THREE. BECAUSE IT CSU

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.266

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:12.767
HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR STUDENTS ON

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:13.601
TO THIS LOWER BASELINE LEVEL THE

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.703
CURRENT ACT. IT STILL WOULD BE

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:16.771
PROJECTED TO SERVE FEWER

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.706

YEARS EARLIER TWENTY TWENTY

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:23.945
TWENTY ONE. AND SO WE THINK THAT

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:25.613
THE LEGISLATURE. WE WISH TO

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.148

YES THE- YOUR YOUR AGENDA ITEM I

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:44.272
THINK THAT- PROPERLY- REFLECTS

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:45.907
THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST THAT

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:47.375
WE HAVE WITH THE TEN AGAINST

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:48.810
CALIFORNIA BAPTIST ASSOCIATION

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:50.611

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:53.314
MILLION DOLLARS- THAT WILL COVER

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:55.049
THE GENERAL SALARY INCREASE BUT

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.083
THEN THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:59.554
ELEMENT CONSTRUCTION INCREASE SO

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.321
EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.890
THEIR- WE ALSO HAVE- I NUMBER

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:05.426
MANDATORY ITEMS THAT- THIS KING

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:07.695
POINTED OUT. IN HER ANALYSIS AND

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.564
THAT IS REFLECTED JAMES WELL

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.766
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.968
BASIC THAT WE MUST COVER SO FOR

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:18.573
EXAMPLE. CALPERS SHEETS ANYMORE

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:22.376
HEALTH CARE- PROGRAM COSTS THOSE

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:24.078
COSTS HAVE GONE UP BY ABOUT

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.479
FORTY NINE DOGS YOURSELF THOSE

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:27.048
ARE FIRM COSTS THAT WE WILL HAVE

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:28.449
IT THE UNIVERSE REGARDLESS OF

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:31.052
HOW MUCH FUNDS PROVIDED. IN THE

01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:32.420
BEYOND THAT IT JUST BECOMES A

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:34.188
DECISION MAKING TREE ULTIMATELY

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:36.123
WHEN YOU THE GOVERNOR IN THE

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:38.025
ASSEMBLY COME TO A CONCLUSION ON

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:40.161
WHAT WILL BE IN THE BUDGET NOPE

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:41.963
IT'S TOUCH UP MORE BECAUSE WE

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:43.598
HAVE SO MANY OTHER PARTIES LIKE

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:45.933
TO ADDRESS FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.335
BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:48.970
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE WOULD BE

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:52.707
REALLY DIFFICULT TO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:56.744
REALLY BEST A LOT OF PAIN CITING

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:57.912
. AND LONG TERM DEBT SIR ON USED

01:31:57.979 --> 01:31:59.614
TO STILL. WILL TO THAT A LITTLE

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.049
BIT MORE LITTLE BIT WEST ADVICE

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:03.317
JUAN AND OTHERS. BUT IT JUST

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:05.553
MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER TO BE

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.220
ABLE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE OTHER

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:09.390
PRIORITIES. THAT ARE NOT.

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.092
FREEING CLEAR RIGHT IN OUR FACE

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:12.693
SO TO SPEAK BUT ARE THINGS THAT

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.428
ARE ASPIRATIONAL. LIKE TO

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:16.430
INVESTORS. LIKE TO GRADUATION

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:18.232
AND SHIP REPLY CAN FACILITY

01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:19.867
ITSELF WILL BE MORE CHALLENGING

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:21.035
OBVIOUSLY NOTICING THAT STILL

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:23.704
HAS THAT STILL OPEN A SENATOR.

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.706
RELATED YOUR QUESTION. IS THAT

01:32:25.773 --> 01:32:27.508
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER.

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:28.943
REPRESENTED AND NOT REPRESENTED

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:30.778
GROUPS THAT HAVE HAVE NOT HAD

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:33.714
ANY SORT OF A RESOLUTION TO

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:36.250
THEIR- SALARY NEEDS FOR. FOR THE

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:37.785
FUTURE SO THOSE ARE THAT'S

01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:38.319
THAT'S GONNA BE NO THEIR

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.154
TRUNCHEONS. OF COSTS THAT WE

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.556
WILL BE- I NEED TO ADDRESS WITH

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:44.458
THIS TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION

01:32:44.525 --> 01:32:46.560
DOLLARS SO. I DON'T WANT TO DO

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:48.029
NOT SOMETHING PRICE I DON'T WANT

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:52.900
TO INFLUENCE. YOUR YOUR- NEGOTIN

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.969
. BY A UP QUESTION BUT IF. HE

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:57.405
WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT HOWEVER

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:58.973
YOU CONCLUDE THOSE AGREEMENTS

01:32:59.040 --> 01:32:59.941
YOU HAVE ENOUGH FROM THE

01:33:00.007 --> 01:33:02.443
GOVERNOR'S 5% TO PAY FOR THEM. I

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:04.879
WILL CERTAINLY SIR DUCK THAT

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.047
QUESTION FOR NOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:08.015
LET THAT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:10.551
THE UNIONS AND- MANAGEMENT WORK

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:11.585
THEMSELVES THROUGH AND WE'LL

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.087
JUST HAVE TO SEE WHERE THOSE

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:14.655
AGREEMENTS PLAN BUT OBVIOUSLY

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:16.057
IT. THIS WILL BE ONE OF ONE THIS

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:17.391

GAPS- NOT ONLY IN THE SHORT TERM

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.539
BUT WITH THE GOAL OF ELIMINATING

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:41.709
THEM PERMANENTLY- THAT INCLUDES.

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:43.577
SOME OF THAT GAP HAS IS CAUSED

01:34:43.644 --> 01:34:45.780
BY STUDENTS SIMPLY LEAVING THE

01:34:45.846 --> 01:34:47.648
UNIVERSITY DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.183

I MENTION IN TERMS OF. A FOCUS

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:53.354

AMONG OTHERS THAT MAY HAVE LEFT

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:03.097
THE UNIVERSITY DURING THE

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:05.699
PANDEMIC AND- FINDING OUT IN

LEVEL- THE REASONSWHY THEY LEFT

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:14.575
THE CSU WHAT STEPS CAN BE TAKEN

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:16.010
TO GET THEM BACK INTO THE C. S.

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:19.547

01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:23.717
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND AS A

01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:25.619
REFERENCE THAT REALLY IS AT AN

01:35:25.686 --> 01:35:27.455
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND I'LL I'LL

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:28.456
HIGHLIGHT ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES

01:35:28.522 --> 01:35:30.591
SAN FRANCISCO STATE THAT BEGAN

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:33.094
THIS WORK VERY EARLY- FOCUSING

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.728
ALL STUDENTS FROM THE ENTERING

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:37.298
CLASS OF TWENTY NINETEEN OR FALL

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:38.699
TWENTY TWENTY. THAT WERE NO

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:41.635
LONGER STILL ENROLLED AND AGAIN

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:44.038
SORT OF CREATING A TRIAGE TEAM

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:45.673
TO MAKE OUT REACHED STUDENTS TO

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:51.178
WORK THROUGH INDIVIDUAL. C.

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.480
ISSUE COMMUNITY IN THIS ASE SAN

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:54.115
FRANCISCO STATE AND IN THEIR

01:35:54.181 --> 01:35:56.417
CASE WHILE THEY MAY HAVE ONLY

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:59.353
INITIALLY. HAD A GOAL OF

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.155
RECOUPING 10% OF THEIR STUDENT

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:02.556
OF THOSE STUDENTS AN ACT FIRST

01:36:02.623 --> 01:36:04.125
PASSED ACTUALLY DOUBLE THAT IN

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:06.127
AND RECOUP TO- 20% OF THOSE

01:36:06.193 --> 01:36:08.062
STUDENTS SO IT'S THAT VERY

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:09.864
INDIVIDUALIZED STRATEGY THAT IS

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:12.032
IN THE SHORT TERM. AS WELL AS

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:14.368

COURSES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.775

LOOK AT THE- G. THE STRUCTURE. I

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:36.624
THOUGHT OLOGY THE- THE MODE OF

INSTRUCTION TO REALLY LOOK AND

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:40.561
SEE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.696
TO RETHINK AND REWORK THAT

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:44.365
TEACHING APPROACH SO THAT WE

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:45.966
HAVE STRONGER OUTCOMES AGAIN

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:47.601
USING THE SAME CURRICULUM AND

01:36:57.111 --> 01:37:00.181
TO BE MORE SYSTEMIC CHANGES.

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:02.249
FOCUSED ON- AS I SAID SORT OF

THE- THERE'S ONE BUILDING THAT

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.708

SO I THINK THE PRIORITY IS.

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:13.367
SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT POINT SEVEN

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:14.968
MILLION JUST FOR THE FACILITIES

01:41:15.035 --> 01:41:17.704
TO MAKE SURE THEY COME BACK. AND

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:18.272
THEN THIRTY MILLION FOR AN

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:21.275
ADDITIONAL- ACADEMIC CENTER THAT

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:24.144
MIGHT FOCUS. ON THE REBUILD AND

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:26.513
VISITORS AND OTHER THINGS AND MY

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:30.751
QUESTION IS. COULD YOU SPEAK TO

01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:32.286
. WHERE MONEY HAS COME IN FOR

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:33.720
THE REBUILT I MEAN AS THEIR

01:41:33.787 --> 01:41:36.623
DISASTER RELIEF MONEY IT IS

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:38.325
THEIR OTHER STUFF THAT THAT IS

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:39.993
COMING IN THIS IS JUST THE

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.095
UNFUNDED GAP AT THE END TO DO

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:45.098
THE REBUILD BAND- JUST SPEAK TO

01:41:45.165 --> 01:41:47.835
SORT OF WHAT MIGHT BE A REQUEST

01:41:47.901 --> 01:41:51.472
RELATED. TO THAT. SENATOR SO IN

01:41:51.538 --> 01:41:53.740
IN KIND OF A ROUGH ORDER OF

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:56.410
MAGNITUDE. SO THERE'S A CURRENT

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:58.612
ESTIMATE OF BETWEEN FORTY NINE

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:00.614
POINT THREE MILLION AND FIFTY

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:02.416
FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:04.418
TO RE TURN THE RANCH TO ITS

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:06.053
PRIOR STATE SO THIS IS JUST KIND

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:08.188
OF THESE TWO PIECES OF THIS OF

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:11.558
THIS RANCHES SITUATION FIRST AS-

01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:12.626
CAN WE GET IT BACK TO WHAT IT

01:42:12.693 --> 01:42:14.895
WAS BEFORE AND THEN THERE'S AN

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:16.396
ASPIRATIONAL ASPECT OF IT.

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:18.198
THAT'S BEYOND THAT FOR-

01:42:18.265 --> 01:42:20.300
EXPANDING AND MAKING A LARGER

01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:22.536
EDUCATIONAL CENTER SO JUST ON

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:24.204
THE PART OF GETTING THE RANCH

01:42:24.271 --> 01:42:26.473
BACK TO WHERE WAS BEFORE

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:28.675
OBVIOUSLY WITH NEW BUILDINGS IN

01:42:28.742 --> 01:42:29.743
THE RENT FOR STRUCTURE. RIGHT

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.279
NOW WE HAVE ABOUT THREE PIECES

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:35.582
OF THIS RESTORATION FIRST IS

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:36.283
ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MILLION

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:39.152
DOLLARS ESTIMATED- THAT WILL BE

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:41.054
COMING IN FROM INSURANCE THAT

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:43.524
COVERS YOU KNOW BUILDINGS THINGS

01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:45.726
THAT WERE COVERED IN THAT WAY-

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:48.061
THEN ALSO THE CAMPUS SAN LUIS

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:53.033
OBISPO HAS SUBMITTED EAST. BASED

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:54.935
ON THEIR TO. REIMBURSED FOR

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:56.770
YOU'RE LOOKING T ABOUT ELEVEN

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:58.639
POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

01:42:58.705 --> 01:43:01.575
REIMBURSEMENT SOME MANY MONTHS

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:03.944
IF NOT YEARS DOWN THE ROAD-

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:06.780
THAT'S USUALLY AT. THAT DURATION

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:07.281
OF TIME IT TAKES PAYMENT

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:10.217
ACTUALLY. FOLLOW THROUGH AND

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:12.252
FINISH OFF CLAIMS. THAT LEAVES

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:14.121
THE CAMPUS WITH THAT AMOUNT THAT

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:17.758
YOU MENTION EIGHT POINT SEVEN

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:18.292
EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:20.294
DOLLARS. OF KIND OF A GAP

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.396
BECAUSE ON A FEMA CLAIM THEY

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:23.330
COVER TYPICALLY SEVENTY FIVE

01:43:23.397 --> 01:43:28.268
PERCENT. OF THE COST OF A CLAIM

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:29.303
AND THEN THERE'S THIS KIND OF

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:31.405
THIS GAP AND WHAT'S ALSO PART OF

01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:33.674
THIS EQUATION ON THE EIGHT POINT

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:34.408
SEVEN MILLION THAT YOU REFERENCE

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:38.812
SENATOR. IS THIS NOTION THAT-

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:39.813
THERE'S AN ADJUSTMENT OVER THE

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.416
WHOLE. TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:44.318
BECAUSE AS TIME MARCHES ON AND

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:45.819
CONSTRUCTION COSTS INCREASING

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:48.188
PERMITTING- REMAINING COST

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:50.324
INCREASES WELL. WE'RE WE'RE JUST

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:52.125
BUILDING IN AN ADDITIONAL THE

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:54.027
CAMPUS IS BUILT AN ADDITIONAL

01:43:54.094 --> 01:43:56.396
10% ADJUSTMENT JUST A FACTORY

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:58.632
AND I'M NOT JUST GETTING THE

01:43:58.699 --> 01:44:01.802
MONEY BACK- TO COVER CURRENT

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:03.537
COST BUT YOU DO NEED TO BUILD IN

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:04.738
SOME SORT OF FUNCTION OF

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:06.607
INSULATION SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:08.208
ABOUT EIGHT POINT SEVEN EIGHT

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:09.876
EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:12.212
DOLLARS. F FUNDING GAP- BUT I

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:13.547
DIED ALSO DON'T WANT TO LEAVE

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:14.047
THE COMMITTEE WITH THE

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:15.849
IMPRESSION THAT THIS IS ALL

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:17.184
GONNA COME TOGETHER SUPER

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:19.720
QUICKLY AT THE MOMENT YOU KNOW

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:22.923
THE CAMPUS HAS A MULTI YEAR-

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:25.158
PLAN IN TERMS OF GETTING GETTING

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:27.260
A SWANTON PACIFIC RANCH BACK UP

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:29.262
AND RUNNING. SEPARATELY APART

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:31.798
FROM THAT THERE'S THIS DESIRED

01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:33.000
JUST HAPPENED EVEN BEFORE THE

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:34.501
FIRE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:36.336
THAT THERE WAS A DESIRE TO AND

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:39.172
ACTUALLY- A PERMIT TO ACTUALLY

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:40.907
EXPAND ALL OF THE EDUCATIONAL

01:44:40.974 --> 01:44:42.542
CENTER FACILITIES PRETTY

01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:44.678
EXTENSIVELY- FROM THAT VANTAGE

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:46.580
POINT THAT'S THAT'S ASPIRATIONAL

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:49.216
SAYING THAT IS GOING TO THAT

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:51.084
THAT'S ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT

01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:52.519
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:54.655
THERE'S NO FUNDING. FROM ANY

01:44:54.721 --> 01:44:56.189
SOURCE COMING IN FOR THAT THAT'S

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:57.824
GONNA REQUIRE PHILANTHROPIC AND

01:44:57.891 --> 01:44:59.960
OTHER SOURCES ON THE GROUND IT'S

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:01.461
KIND OF A LONG TERM ASPIRATIONAL

01:45:01.528 --> 01:45:03.063
AS MUCH SO HOPE THAT WAS HELPFUL

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:04.464
TO YOU THAT ACTUALLY WAS VERY

01:45:04.531 --> 01:45:06.199
HELPFUL AND- I HAD THE

01:45:06.266 --> 01:45:08.301
MISFORTUNE DURING MY NINE YEARS

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:10.470
ON THE CITY COUNCIL TO HAVE A-

01:45:10.537 --> 01:45:11.905
HUNDRED YEAR STORM IN THE FIRST

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:14.908
SIX WEEKS AND THEN AN EARTHQUAKE

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:22.649
DESTROY OUR DOWNTOWN THE. YOUR

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:24.418
IN YEARS BETWEEN AND THE FEMA.

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:25.018
OF PAYMENT FOR THE FOR DESERVE

01:45:25.085 --> 01:45:26.153
HAD NOT BEEN. BY THE TIME A LOT

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:28.088
OF THEM BY THE OF THIS DOES. SO

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:29.923
UNDER HOW. OF THAT PROCESS TAKES

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.626
UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT ARE YOU

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:34.261
ARE MAKING PROJECTIONS AND

01:45:34.327 --> 01:45:35.762
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS AS SORT

01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:37.698
OF THE PLOT NUMBER BASED ON ONCE

01:45:37.764 --> 01:45:39.533
INSURANCE AND FEMA AND OTHER

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:42.602
THINGS CALM. BUT WE ARE ALSO IN

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:44.571
A UNIQUE BUDGET SITUATION THIS

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:45.772
YEAR WHERE THERE WILL BE

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:47.207
PRIORITY TO ONE TIME

01:45:47.274 --> 01:45:49.109
EXPENDITURES AND NOT ON GOING

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:51.044
EXPENDITURES AND SO I WOULD

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:54.114
HOPE. THAT YOU AGREE ON THIS AND

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:55.949
GIVE US THE CHANCE TO HELP YOU

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:57.250
THIS YEAR IF SOME OF US ON THE

01:45:57.317 --> 01:45:59.553
COMMITTEE WANT TO DO THAT AS WE

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:02.022
MOVE TOWARD. THE DECISION MAKING

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:04.224
IN MAY SO I THINK WE WOULD WANT

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:06.259
TO MAKE SURE. THAT YOU UPDATE

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:08.795
THESE NUMBERS MAKE THEM CLEAR IF

01:46:08.862 --> 01:46:10.230
THERE WAS A ONE TIME

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:12.265
APPROPRIATION MAY DID IT BE DONE

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:13.300
IN A WAY THAT IT COULD SURVIVE

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:16.536
YEARS AND MAKE SURE THAT IT. IF

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:18.105
MAJOR GAP ONE HOWEVER THESE

01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:20.807
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES COME IN.

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:23.043
AND I WOULD JUST HOPE. THAT

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:25.645
FINANCE IN AND AWAY- WOULD WORK

01:46:25.712 --> 01:46:27.514

LITTLE OVER THREE MILLION

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:21.628
DOLLARS THAT WE WOULD BE

EMPHASIZE CAN WE DO ALL OF THEM

01:51:02.355 --> 01:51:03.289

NUMBER IS THAT SATURDAY

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:16.036
SOMETHING IF YOU COST ESTIMATE.

01:51:16.102 --> 01:51:18.438
FOR DOING EACH OF THOSE FOUR

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:20.106
EXTRA STUFF ITEMS. AND WHILE I

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:21.775
CAN'T GET A MENTAL MATH OFF THE

01:51:21.841 --> 01:51:25.245
TOP OF MY HEAD. AND DEBT WE DID.

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:26.513
FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:29.949
PROPOSED APPLICATION LEVEL. AS

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:31.584
TWO HUNDRED ONE MILLION FIVE

01:51:31.651 --> 01:51:33.019
PERCENT. WOULD LIKELY BE ENOUGH

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:35.655
TO COVER. SAID BULLETED ITEMS AS

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:37.557
IT REGARDS AS IT RELATES TO

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:40.326
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND AS OTHER.

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:41.661
I'M COSTS BUSINESS JUST TRYING

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:43.263
TO FIND THINGS LIKE MAINTENANCE.

01:51:43.329 --> 01:51:45.665
AND OPERATING EXPENSES AND

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:47.700
EQUIPMENT INFLATION. IT WOULD

01:51:47.767 --> 01:51:49.536
ALSO BE ENOUGH TO COVER THAT

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:51.604
SALARY INCREASES INCLUDED IN THE

01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:58.178
AGREEMENT LANDSCAPES FACULTY.

01:51:58.244 --> 01:51:59.212
AND WE THINK THAT WOULD LIKE

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:01.047
LEAVE ENOUGH FOR APPROXIMATELY

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:02.982
THREE PER INCREASE IN SALARY FOR

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:14.294
OTHER NON OF. I HAVE ONE MORE

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.796
QUESTION BUT I'M GONNA WAIT- I

01:52:16.863 --> 01:52:18.198
WOULD MAKE SURE I HAVE A

01:52:18.264 --> 01:52:21.034
ANDERSON THIS BEFORE I ASK SO-

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:23.937
OKAY. YEAH OF GIVE THIS BACK TO

01:52:24.003 --> 01:52:27.474
US INNER LAYER. THANK YOU VERY

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:34.747
MUCH MEN. THANK YOU CHAIRED BY.

01:52:34.814 --> 01:52:37.217
I THANK YOU CHIRLA AND- I JUST

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:40.120
WANT TO THE GOVERNOR FOR- THE 5%

01:52:40.186 --> 01:52:41.588
BASING CREATES I THINK THAT IS

01:52:41.654 --> 01:52:46.759
CRITICAL FOR US TO- PORTION- I

01:52:46.826 --> 01:52:48.394
KIND OF THINK OF THE CSU'S IN

01:52:48.461 --> 01:52:50.730
AND HIRE A GENERALLY IS- SUBJECT

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:52.365
TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF LOCAL

01:52:52.432 --> 01:52:54.100
CONTROL THAT THIS LEGISLATURE.

01:52:54.167 --> 01:52:57.103
OFTEN LOOKS TO IN ALLOCATING-

01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.538
BUDGET FUNDS. IT IS CERTAINLY I

01:52:58.605 --> 01:52:59.839
THINK THIS YES ARE BETTER

01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:02.742
POSITIONED AND THEN. WE OR THE

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:04.844
GOVERNOR TO TRY TO ALLOCATE

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.112
FUNDS TO SOME OF THEIR DIFFERENT

01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:08.014
NEEDS AND- I THINK. IT'S BEEN

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:09.082
AWHILE SINCE WE'VE GIVEN THE

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:11.050
SIGNIFICANT BASED INCREASE I

01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:12.018
THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE OF

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:15.021
THESE FUNDS. MY QUESTION HERE.

01:53:15.088 --> 01:53:16.489
AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY FOR

01:53:16.556 --> 01:53:18.424
MR STORM OR SOMEONE ELSE FROM

01:53:18.491 --> 01:53:20.693
CSU. I EASE YOU KNOW WE TALK

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:23.296
ABOUT THE DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT.

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:25.064
I WANTED TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:26.933
BIT ON THAT IN AND SEE IF WE

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.568
COULD UNDERSTAND SIR WHAT WAS

01:53:28.635 --> 01:53:30.136
CAUSING THIS AND TO WHAT DEGREE.

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:31.171
THAT THE CRIME WAS DRIVEN BY

01:53:31.237 --> 01:53:32.972
SHORT TERM COVERAGE RELATED

01:53:33.039 --> 01:53:35.241
FACTORS VERSUS LONGER TERM MORE

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:37.744
STRUCTURAL FACTORS. IN I GUESS I

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.679
JUST START BY ASKING DO WE HAVE

01:53:39.746 --> 01:53:42.515
ANY DATA GENERALLY ON. LIKE WHAT

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:44.517
VARIABLES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:53:44.584 --> 01:53:46.619
INCREASES OR DECLINES IN

01:53:46.686 --> 01:53:49.022
ENROLLMENT- TO MAYBE I'LL START

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:53.393
THERE. AND I BELIEVE THAT MR

01:53:53.459 --> 01:53:54.894
STORM'S GOING TO HAND OUT TO

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:56.996
MISSION OKAY. THAT'S RIGHT THANK

01:53:57.063 --> 01:53:59.866
YOU I THINK YOU CENTER MAN- YES-

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:02.202
YOU DATE SO THE INFORMATION THAT

01:54:02.268 --> 01:54:03.903
IS IN THE AGENDA IS CERTAINLY

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:05.838
LOOKING AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL

01:54:05.905 --> 01:54:07.207
FOR THE CSU AND ALL OF OUR

01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:09.609
CAMPUSES. BUT TO YOUR QUESTION

01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:11.177
IN TERMS OF GETTING UNDERNEATH

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:13.279
THAT WE DO SEE VARIATION BY

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:15.615
CAMPUSES- SO FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IN

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:19.052
FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE HAD-

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:20.820
AT LEAST TWO CAMPUSES THAT WERE

01:54:20.887 --> 01:54:23.022
EITHER AT OR ABOVE. THEIR HIGH

01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:24.524
WATER MARKS FOR ENROLLMENT IN

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:27.660
PRIOR YEARS SO- THE OUTCOMES ON

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:30.597
CAMPUSES WE SEE DO SEE VARIATION

01:54:30.663 --> 01:54:31.898
SOME OF THAT IS GEOGRAPHIC SO

01:54:31.965 --> 01:54:35.068
CAMPUSES THAT ARE- PERHAPS MORE

01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:36.603
RURAL AND DEPENDED ON STUDENTS

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.371
FROM OUTSIDE THE REGION POTS AND

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:40.073
TO MEET THEIR ENROLLMENT NEEDS.

01:54:40.139 --> 01:54:43.376
ARE THEIR ENROLLMENT TARGETS.

01:54:43.443 --> 01:54:45.245
THIS A GREATER TO DOWN SOME OF

01:54:45.311 --> 01:54:47.780
CAMPUS IN HER AND SO. AREAS THAT

01:54:47.847 --> 01:54:49.582
. BE AND I SAY MAY BECAUSE I

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:52.118
THINK THERE'S A NOT ONLY-

01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:53.886
INVESTIGATION IN OUR SYSTEM BUT

01:54:53.953 --> 01:54:55.989
IN HIGHER EDUCATION WRIT LARGE-

01:54:56.055 --> 01:54:58.057
MAYBE AND DURING THAT WINDOW OF

01:54:58.124 --> 01:54:59.425
TIME WHERE INSTRUCTION WAS

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:00.927
LARGELY ONLINE THAT STUDENTS

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:03.730
CHOSE TO- MAKE DECISIONS TO

01:55:03.796 --> 01:55:05.431
REMAIN CLOSER TO HOME SO CLOSER

01:55:05.498 --> 01:55:07.533
TO POPULATION CENTERS THROUGHOUT

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.036
THE STATE. WE ALSO- AND AGAIN.

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:12.572
THE ACROSS CAMPUSES BUT IT'S ALL

01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:14.440
SOME DECLINES IN AVERAGE UNIT

01:55:14.507 --> 01:55:16.843
LOAD- IT SO WELL AS WELL WE HAD

01:55:16.909 --> 01:55:18.745
SEEN YEAR OVER YEAR THE AVERAGE

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:20.880
UNIT THAT STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN-

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:22.448
INCREASING WHICH WAS A PART OF

01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:23.850
OUR STRATEGY FOR GRADUATION

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:25.385
INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO

01:55:25.451 --> 01:55:27.687
GET STUDENTS. TO COMPLETION-

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.822
MORE QUICKLY- WE SAW A SLIGHT

01:55:29.889 --> 01:55:31.691
DEEP- DEATH AND THAT AND WE SAW

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:33.559
SOME VARIATION BY SPECIFIC

01:55:33.626 --> 01:55:36.029
STUDENTS SEGMENTS- AGAIN.

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:37.497
INVESTIGATING THAT TRYING TO

01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:38.898
ADDRESS AND AS I MENTIONED IF

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:40.366
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE RE ENROLLMENT

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:41.934
WORK AT OUR CAMPUSES ARE DOING.

01:55:42.001 --> 01:55:43.336
THAT'S OFTEN AT A VERY

01:55:43.403 --> 01:55:45.772
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT- LEVEL TO

01:55:45.838 --> 01:55:47.840
UNDERSTAND THE REASONS PERHAPS

01:55:47.907 --> 01:55:48.808
THEY DID LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:51.444
SO. THERE ARE A VARIETY I THINK

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.146
WHAT IS ENCOURAGING IS WHAT

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:55.748
WE'RE SEEING FOR FALL TWENTY

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:56.616
TWENTY TWO AS I MENTIONED.

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:58.084
APPLICATIONS FOR A FIRST TIME

01:55:58.151 --> 01:55:59.952
STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE

01:56:00.019 --> 01:56:00.620
GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL THIS

01:56:00.687 --> 01:56:02.655
SPRING- HAVE BOUNCED BACK. AND

01:56:02.722 --> 01:56:06.793
AROUND 15% ACROSS THE SYSTEM- WE

01:56:06.859 --> 01:56:08.895
AS AS BY WHAT I BELIEVE MY

01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:10.763
COLLEAGUE FROM- OR MAYBEBOTH

01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:12.699
FROM THE L. A. O. AND DEPARTMENT

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:14.667
OF FINANCE REFERENCE- WE ARE

01:56:14.734 --> 01:56:16.602
WATCHING CLOSELY OR IN IN CLOSE

01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:17.637
COMMUNICATION WITH OUR

01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:19.405
COLLEAGUES IN THE CALIFORNIA

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:20.039
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S

01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:21.841
OFFICE ABOUT. THEIR EXPERIENCE

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:23.609
WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:25.278
ACROSS THE STATE WE KNOW AND NOT

01:56:25.345 --> 01:56:26.479

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:29.882
COLLEGES SAW THE MOST DRAMATIC

01:56:29.949 --> 01:56:32.719
DECREASES IN ENROLLMENT AND SO-

01:56:32.785 --> 01:56:34.620
WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO TRY

TO GET BETTER PROJECTIONS- BUT

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:39.092

OPPORTUNITY. IN. TERMS OF-

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:45.732
GREATER ENROLLMENT OFFER.

01:56:45.798 --> 01:56:46.733
PROSSER SYSTEM THAT WOULD COME

WITH THIS WITH THE- THE BUDGET

01:56:47.533 --> 01:56:49.202
PROPOSAL. THANKS FOR A QUICK

01:56:49.268 --> 01:56:50.670

WHEN I LOOK AT. THE- THAT THE

01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:54.941
DECLINE IN. AT BOTH COMING

01:56:55.007 --> 01:56:56.909
COLLEGES AND CSU. I GUESS IT.

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:58.010
BACKS WERE OF WHICH IS YOU KNOW

01:56:58.077 --> 01:56:59.645
PEOPLE ARE STAYING HOME MORE AND

01:56:59.712 --> 01:57:02.281
MAYBE. MORE RELUCTANT TO GO JOIN

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:03.883
A VIRTUAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT

01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:05.118
WHO WANTS TO GO TO SCHOOL LET

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:07.186
ALONE A VIRTUAL SCHOOL RIGHT-

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.755
BUT ALTERNATIVELY YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.089
WE'RE KIND OF IN THE SECOND YEAR

01:57:10.156 --> 01:57:11.290
OF WHAT IS A VERY INTERESTING

01:57:11.357 --> 01:57:13.059
LABOR MARKET. AND IT IS

01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:14.560
CERTAINLY THE LAST I'D SAY SIX

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:15.962
MONTHS TO YEAR WE'VE SEEN A VERY

01:57:16.028 --> 01:57:17.196
TIGHT LABOR MARKET WITH EVER

01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:19.699
INCREASING WAGES I WAS DRIVING

01:57:19.766 --> 01:57:21.200
BY AND IN AND OUT THE OTHER DAY

01:57:21.267 --> 01:57:23.236
AND I SAW. A SIGN FOR TWENTY.

01:57:23.302 --> 01:57:25.538
MAY NOT AS- NOTHING MAYBE I

01:57:25.605 --> 01:57:26.572
SHOULD TAKE A PART. JOB BECAUSE

01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:29.208
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD WAGES- CANNOT

01:57:29.275 --> 01:57:31.210
. AFTER WE HAVE ALL TEN BUDGET

01:57:31.277 --> 01:57:34.547
HERE FAIR ENOUGH. HI I WAS YOU

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:36.682
KNOW JUST KIND OF WONDERING- YOU

01:57:36.749 --> 01:57:37.116
KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE

01:57:37.183 --> 01:57:38.885
HISTORICALLY. MAYBE BECAUSE WE

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:40.119
DON'T HAVE THE COVERT SPECIFIC

01:57:40.186 --> 01:57:41.487
DID I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TO.

01:57:41.554 --> 01:57:44.390
NAY SENT ITS TO RECENT. BUT YOU

01:57:44.457 --> 01:57:45.525
KNOW PRESUMABLY YOU GUYS HAVE A

01:57:45.591 --> 01:57:47.226
SENSE OF LIKE WHAT HAPPENS

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:48.428
DURING RECESSIONS AND ECONOMIC

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:50.196
BOOMS. I IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE

01:57:50.263 --> 01:57:51.364
WE HAD A TIGHT LABOR MARKET BUT

01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:52.865
DO WE TEND TO SEE DECLINES IN

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:54.434
ENROLLMENT OR BOARD. NO IMPACTS

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:55.935
ARE ONE OF THE FACTS OF. THESE

01:57:56.002 --> 01:57:57.904
TYPES OF TIGHT LABOR MARKETS ON

01:57:57.970 --> 01:58:00.406
ENROLLMENT AT CSU'S. SACRAMENTO

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:01.441
WONDERFUL QUESTION AND

01:58:01.507 --> 01:58:02.775
ABSOLUTELY THERE IS A

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:04.844
CORRELATION I'M TRADITIONALLY

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:06.979
WITH. THE LABOR SITUATION AND

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:09.949
THE ECONOMY I'M PARTICULARLY.

01:58:10.016 --> 01:58:10.983
FOR AT THE TRANSFER STUDENT

01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:13.152
POPULATION AND POST BACK- THAT

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:14.720
INDIVIDUALS MAY CHOOSE NOT. TO

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:17.623
EAT TO EITHER DELAY. OR TO STOP

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:19.258
OUT. I'M IN THOSE STUDENT

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:20.993
CATEGORIES WHEN THERE IS A VERY

01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:23.296
TIGHT LABOR MARKET BECAUSE

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:27.099
THOSE- THE COST BENEFIT. IN THE

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:28.768
MARK DATA DELAYED MARKET TIME.

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:31.204
YOU TEARS YOUR AND DRIVING. AND

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:34.474
TRYING TO DO THE HARD. I DON'T.

01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:35.842
MANY OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:37.410
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IN IN

01:58:37.477 --> 01:58:38.578
SORT OF ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:39.946
HAVE SORT OF FLYING OUT THE

01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:41.380
WINDOW DURING THE PANDEMIC I

01:58:41.447 --> 01:58:42.582
DON'T THINK THAT'S JUST FOR THE

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:44.116
CSU I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:58:44.183 --> 01:58:45.251
CERTAINLY SEEING AND HEARING

01:58:45.318 --> 01:58:46.953
THAT FROM. OUR COLLEAGUES FROM

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:49.021
UNIVERSITIES AND INSTITUTIONS

01:58:49.088 --> 01:58:51.023
ACROSS THE COUNTRY- YOU KNOW FOR

01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:52.758
EXAMPLE AS I MENTIONED WE

01:58:52.825 --> 01:58:54.193
ACTUALLY BUCKED THE NATIONAL

01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:56.095
TREND IN THE PRECEDING FALL THE

01:58:56.162 --> 01:58:57.763
FIRST BALL OF THE PANDEMIC AND

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.165
ACTUALLY HAD RECORDS CSU

01:58:59.232 --> 01:59:01.467
ENROLLMENT AND I ACTUALLY SAW

01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:03.002
INCREASES IN TRANSFER STUDENTS.

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:04.937
AT A TIME WHEN THEN- THERE WERE

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:07.240
SIGNIFICANT LAYOFFS AND SO NOT

01:59:07.306 --> 01:59:09.709
EVERYTHING WAS LINING UP AS IT

01:59:09.775 --> 01:59:11.911
S IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN OTHER.

01:59:11.978 --> 01:59:13.846
OKAY RECESSIONS AND DURING A

01:59:13.913 --> 01:59:15.214
VERY STRONG ECONOMIC TIMES AND

01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:17.350
LABOR MARKET SO. IT'S A LITTLE

01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:19.151
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ.

01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:21.420
WHAT THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT WILL

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:23.723
BE BUT CERTAINLY FOR CERTAIN

01:59:23.789 --> 01:59:25.591
STUDENT POPULATIONS THAT- A

01:59:25.658 --> 01:59:27.260
CRITICAL IS A TRANSFER STUDENTS

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:29.262
AND POST BACCALAUREATE STUDENTS.

01:59:29.328 --> 01:59:31.130
THEY'RE THEY'RE- WEIGHING BACK

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:32.732
COST BENEFIT OF GOING INTO THE

01:59:32.798 --> 01:59:33.799
LABOR MARKET IS SOMETHING THAT

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:35.401
MAY BE OF HIGHER. IMPORTANCE

01:59:35.468 --> 01:59:37.103
RIGHT NOW. SO FINAL QUESTION FOR

01:59:37.169 --> 01:59:39.405
YOU- WE SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE

01:59:39.472 --> 01:59:40.339
GETTING THIS WRONG A LITTLE BIT

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:42.275
AND AT LEAST FOR LIKE THE NEXT

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:43.643
FEW YEARS WE'RE GOING TO SEE A-

01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:44.777
DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT BEYOND

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:45.811
WHAT WE'RE- PROJECTING RIGHT

01:59:45.878 --> 01:59:47.280
NOW. WILL BE THE IMPACT

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:49.782
STRUCTURALLY ON YOUR BUDGET- AND

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:51.150
WHAT WOULD THAT IMPLY FROM OUR

01:59:51.217 --> 01:59:52.285
PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS WHERE WE

01:59:52.351 --> 01:59:53.886
SHOULD DIRECT RESOURCES DURING

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:56.455
WHAT IS A- YOU KNOW. AN UNUSUAL

01:59:56.522 --> 02:00:00.426
SECULAR HI HERE AS FAR AS OUR

02:00:00.493 --> 02:00:01.127
BUDGET SITUATION. ANOTHER IS

02:00:01.193 --> 02:00:02.328
WHAT WHICH WE SPEND THIS MONEY.

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:04.664
ASSEMBLY WANNA HELP THE CSU'S-

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:06.265
YOU KNOW PROP UP THINGS. BUT

02:00:06.332 --> 02:00:07.567
ASSUMING ALSO THAT WHEN THEY SEE

02:00:07.633 --> 02:00:09.735
MAYBE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS-

02:00:09.802 --> 02:00:11.003
DECLINES IN ENROLLMENTS WHAT

02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:12.672
WHAT IS THE BEST BANG FOR THE

02:00:12.738 --> 02:00:16.242
BUCK. WELL IF I COULD TAKE THAT-

02:00:16.309 --> 02:00:17.777
I THINK ONE THING I NEED TO STEP

02:00:17.843 --> 02:00:19.979
BACK AND- EXPLAIN SOMETHING

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:21.547
FIRST SENATOR SO WE CAN

02:00:21.614 --> 02:00:24.750
UNDERSTAND HOW ENROLLMENT WORKS

02:00:24.817 --> 02:00:26.185
FUNDAMENTALLY FROM A BUDGETARY

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:28.921
PERSPECTIVE. SO SINCE THE

02:00:28.988 --> 02:00:31.057
BEGINNING OF THE CSU. THERE'S

02:00:31.123 --> 02:00:33.025
BEEN THIS CONTRACT ESSENTIALLY

02:00:33.092 --> 02:00:34.860
BETWEEN THE C. ISSUE IN STATE.

02:00:34.927 --> 02:00:36.295
AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENED

02:00:36.362 --> 02:00:38.464
FOR MANY DECADES AND ABOUT A

02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:40.166
COUPLE DECADES AGO THIS MODEL

02:00:40.232 --> 02:00:42.168
WAS A LITTLE BIT OF JUSTICE BUT

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:43.669
THE IDEA WAS THAT. FOR EVERY

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:46.872
STUDENT THAT WE ADD WORK EDUCATE

02:00:46.939 --> 02:00:49.275
WE WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING FROM

02:00:49.342 --> 02:00:50.509
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO

02:00:50.576 --> 02:00:54.780
EDUCATE. IN OVER THE LAST SIX

02:00:54.847 --> 02:00:57.316
DECADES WE HAVE INCREMENTALLY

RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE STATE

02:00:58.951 --> 02:01:00.286
TO EDUCATE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

02:01:00.353 --> 02:01:02.154
STUDENTS AND THAT'S CALLED WHAT

02:01:02.221 --> 02:01:03.155

TIMES ARE GOING TO BE BELOW THAT

02:02:02.014 --> 02:02:04.083
. RIGHT NOW THERE MIGHT BE YOU

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:05.184

EDUCATING THEM THAT'S A TOUGH

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:56.569
CALL TO MAKE BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:12.785
HYPOTHETICALLY. YOU COULD

REDIRECT SOME OF THAT FUNDING TO

02:03:14.386 --> 02:03:16.288
OTHER THINGS LIKE GRADUATION

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:17.823
THIS YEAR. SO YEAH WHILE IT

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.592

02:03:19.658 --> 02:03:20.793
ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR OUR

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:24.363
CAMPUSES. I ANTICIPATED. YOU

THERE WILL BE MONEY THAT WILL BE

02:03:27.333 --> 02:03:28.634
DEDICATED TO GRAB CHIPS THE

02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:30.636
CURRENT LOT OF STUDENTS SO THAT

02:03:30.703 --> 02:03:32.338
THEY CAN GET JUST ALL THE

COURSES THEY NEED TO DO THAT.

02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:36.008
BUT AS FOR OUR PLANNING GOES

02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:38.244
WE'RE MARCHING FORWARD WITH THE

02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:40.679
IDEA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION.

BUT MEASURES TO PROPOSALS

02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:44.517
ENACTED. THAT WE WILL BE GROWING

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:47.052
ARE LED BY THAT NINE THOUSAND

AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WOULD

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:43.001
ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN

02:10:43.068 --> 02:10:43.869
THINKING ABOUT A LONG TERM

COMMUNITY COLLEGE WEEK YESTERDAY

02:20:54.279 --> 02:20:55.880
AND THEN MAP WITH A NUMBER OF

02:20:55.947 --> 02:20:58.016
TRUSTEES AFTERWARDS. AND THEY

02:20:58.082 --> 02:21:00.285
WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:21:02.253 --> 02:21:04.022
I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT AND

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:05.023
SOME OF THE REGENTS AT THE

02:21:05.089 --> 02:21:06.825
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT

02:21:06.891 --> 02:21:09.194
IT AND WE HAVE CSU HERE. AND THE

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:11.529
INTERESTING THING IS THAT OF

02:21:11.596 --> 02:21:13.431
THIS PROGRAM IS OVER SUBSCRIBED

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:15.400
ALREADY AND IT'S IN ITS FIRST

02:21:15.466 --> 02:21:17.569
YEAR AND THERE IS A BIG DEMAND

02:21:17.635 --> 02:21:18.436
AS I MOVED TO THE DISTRICT

02:21:18.503 --> 02:21:19.971
AROUND THE STATE DURING THE

02:21:20.038 --> 02:21:22.173
INTERIM. THE WHOLE LEVEL OF

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:23.775
HOUSING AND SECURITY AT THE

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.543
HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:27.979
PHENOMENAL AND SO. I REALLY

02:21:28.046 --> 02:21:31.249
APPRECIATE CSU PAWNING REALLY

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:32.717
APPRECIATE THE MAXIMIZING

02:21:32.784 --> 02:21:34.452
WHATEVER THEY CAN GET AND I KNOW

02:21:34.519 --> 02:21:36.454
THERE WAS A BLIP AND SORT OF HOW

02:21:36.521 --> 02:21:40.558
THIS UNFOLDED. AT CSU AND I JUST

02:21:40.625 --> 02:21:42.360
HOPE AS WE WORK THROUGH ALL

02:21:42.427 --> 02:21:43.862
THREE BRANCHES AND GET REPORTS

02:21:43.928 --> 02:21:45.730
JUST LIKE THIS FROM THE OTHER

02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:50.602
TWO BRANCHES. THAT THE FINANCE.

02:21:50.668 --> 02:21:52.337
DEPARTMENT WILL REALLY ASSESS-

02:21:52.403 --> 02:21:54.005
BECAUSE A ANECDOTE I HEARD THERE

02:21:54.072 --> 02:21:55.073

02:21:55.139 --> 02:21:57.075

THREE YEARS AND THAT SNAP. AND

02:22:00.578 --> 02:22:02.013
SO I WOULD HOPE THE FINANCE

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:04.015
DEPARTMENT WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT.

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:06.384
THE AMOUNT IT'S BEEN APPLIED FOR

02:22:06.451 --> 02:22:08.319
WHETHER IT HAS SOME VALIDITY.

02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:11.155
WHETHER THIS INDICATES ARE OF. A

02:22:11.222 --> 02:22:13.157
DEMAND IT'S MUCH GREATER THAN-

02:22:13.224 --> 02:22:14.559
MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE AND

02:22:14.626 --> 02:22:16.661
