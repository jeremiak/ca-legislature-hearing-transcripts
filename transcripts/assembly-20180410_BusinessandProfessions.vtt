00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:14.859 region:rollup2
IT IS STILL SCHEDULED FIVE ARE

00:38:12.924 --> 00:38:17.061 region:rollup2
NOT AS OF USABLE AS OUR

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:18.363 region:rollup2
SCHEDULES TWO THREE AND FOUR

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:19.430 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S ALSO MEDICAL USE.

00:38:18.363 --> 00:38:22.167 region:rollup2
BUT THEY CONTAIN SOME VERY

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:24.002 region:rollup2
POWERFUL DRUGS INCLUDING PRO

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:24.502 region:rollup2
METHOD CODING I'M GOING TO

00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:25.370 region:rollup2
MENTION THIS ONE BY ME.

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:27.238 region:rollup2
IT IS THE CAUSE OF MANY

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:29.374 region:rollup2
ROBBERIES PARTICULARLY IN THE

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:30.742 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO AREA OF PHARMACIES

00:38:29.374 --> 00:38:32.410 region:rollup2
AND ADDITIONALLY THE PRODUCT

00:38:30.742 --> 00:38:34.846 region:rollup2
ITSELF IS EXTRAORDINARILY

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:36.514 region:rollup2
VALUABLE ON THE STREET. BUT COST

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:38.449 region:rollup2
THE PHARMACY OR WHAT'S WHAT

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:40.251 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ONCE CAUGHT COST THE

PHARMACY TWELVE DOLLARS A PLATE.

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:42.887 region:rollup2
GOES FOR TWELVE HUNDRED TO

00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:43.688 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:45.423 region:rollup2
STREET.

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:46.958 region:rollup2
THAT THAT CREATES A TREMENDOUS

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:48.526 region:rollup2
DEMAND FOR THIS PRODUCT IT NEEDS

00:38:46.958 --> 00:38:50.528 region:rollup2
TO BE TRACKED AND TRACED AS

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:52.764 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COME INTO PRESCRIBERS AND

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:53.965 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET PRESCRIPTIONS TO COME

00:38:52.764 --> 00:38:57.502 region:rollup2
OUT AND THEN RESELL THE DRUG.

00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:59.170 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY ON THE DATA ON

00:38:57.502 --> 00:39:00.305 region:rollup2

THE CURIOUS DATABASE IS NOT A

00:42:47.098 --> 00:42:49.667 region:rollup2
THIS DRAMA OVER OVER THE COURSE

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:51.202 region:rollup2
OF A FEW YEARS FOR THE NEED FOR

HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. BUT IT'S

00:42:57.742 --> 00:43:02.313 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE DEGREE AWAY AND SO IT'S

00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:04.449 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.802 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WHO WAS PRESCRIBING THE

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:34.337 region:rollup2
MEDICATION SO I MADE THE MISTAKE

01:09:32.802 --> 01:09:35.905 region:rollup2
OF DEEMING IT OKAY AND SAVE. IT

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:37.607 region:rollup2

TABLETS BEFORE THE DISEASE

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:41.044 region:rollup2
CONSUMED MY ENTIRE LIFE

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:42.545 region:rollup2
PARALYZING ME UNTIL I COULD TAKE

THE CYCLE OF PHARMACISTS FLIGHT

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:48.985 region:rollup2
MY PRESCRIPTION STATING THAT IT

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:50.653 region:rollup2
WAS SUSPICIOUS HOW QUICKLY I

01:09:48.985 --> 01:09:52.255 region:rollup2
WOULD GO THROUGH THE REFILLS. MY

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:53.523 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WAS NOTIFIED AND I WAS

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:54.690 region:rollup2
CUT OFF FROM FEATURE OPIATE

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.793 region:rollup2

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:58.628 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY BY THIS TIME I WAS

01:09:56.793 --> 01:10:00.129 region:rollup2
ALREADY HEAVILY ADDICTED AND NOW

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:01.631 region:rollup2
WAS LEFT TO GO INTO WITHDRAWAL

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:03.433 region:rollup2
ELEVEN WITHOUT ANY HELP OR

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:04.734 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OR EDUCATION FROM THE

01:10:03.433 --> 01:10:06.202 region:rollup2
VERY DOCTOR THAT PRESCRIBED AND

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:08.204 region:rollup2
TO ME.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:10.807 region:rollup2
I FELT ALONE SCARED ANGRY AND

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:12.975 region:rollup2
ASHAMED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WHAT

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:14.644 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL WHAT'S BUT I LEARNED.

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:16.112 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE FEAR OF GOING INTO

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.746 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL IS WHAT CAN I

01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:19.415 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL LIFE FOR OVER FOUR

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:20.650 region:rollup2
YEARS MY LIFE QUICKLY BECAME ALL

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:21.517 region:rollup2
ABOUT CHASING MY NEXT TYPE

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.852 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY THING

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:24.253 region:rollup2
THAT KEPT ME FROM GOING INTO

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:25.588 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL.

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:27.256 region:rollup2
I ISOLATED MYSELF FROM MY

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:29.092 region:rollup2
FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY BECAUSE I

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:30.159 region:rollup2
WAS ASHAMED OF WHAT I WAS DOING

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:32.395 region:rollup2
AND I WAS AFRAID OF SOMEBODY

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:33.730 region:rollup2
FINDING OUT. I FOUND MYSELF IN

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:34.931 region:rollup2
THIS NEVER ENDING CYCLE OF

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.200 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY BEING IN FIGHTER

01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:39.168 region:rollup2
FLIGHT MODE. I DID THINGS I

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.137 region:rollup2
NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD I LIED I

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:43.873 region:rollup2
STOLE A BECAME SOMEONE I NO

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:49.045 region:rollup2
LONGER RECOGNIZED I HAD GIVEN.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:50.646 region:rollup2
I HAD GIVEN UP.

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:53.883 region:rollup2
I DID THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:55.518 region:rollup2
WOULD DO I DID THAT.

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:57.587 region:rollup2
I BECAME SOMEONE I NO LONGER

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:59.255 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE I'D GIVEN UP ON LIFE

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.289 region:rollup2
AND HAD TRULY ACCEPTED THAT I

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:01.557 region:rollup2
WOULD DIE YOUNG.

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:03.659 region:rollup2
I SPENT MANY NIGHTS SETTING

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:04.927 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE ALARMS TO TRY TO STAY

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:06.095 region:rollup2
AWAKE BECAUSE I KNEW THERE WAS A

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:07.864 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY THAT I WOULDN'T WAKE

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:09.465 region:rollup2
BACK UP.

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:11.167 region:rollup2
I LOST MY MORALS MY HEALTH MY

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:13.136 region:rollup2
SELF ESTEEM. AND MY HOPE AND MY

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:15.037 region:rollup2
HAPPINESS BUT MOSTLY I LOST MY

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:16.839 region:rollup2

THREE YEARS OLD.

01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:27.016 region:rollup2
IF I KNEW THAT WHAT I KNOW NOW I

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:28.784 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE APPROACHED MY INJURY

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:30.486 region:rollup2

PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS I'M OR MINORS

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:10.680 region:rollup2
ARE PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS. I'M WE

01:14:06.342 --> 01:14:11.314 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME VERY SAD. VERY SERIOUS

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.214 region:rollup2
CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT'S

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:13.382 region:rollup2
WRITTEN.

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.317 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE SPELL DRAWS A

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:15.184 region:rollup2
HARD LINER FIVE DAYS FOR

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.852 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION REGARDLESS OF

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:17.753 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PATIENTS AT NEEDS ARE

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:18.721 region:rollup2
UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS.

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:19.855 region:rollup2
SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO THE DOCTOR

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:20.389 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO APPOINTMENTS.

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.223 region:rollup2
AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:24.093 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO THAT

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:26.062 region:rollup2
PATIENT AND WE THINK THAT TIME.

01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:28.764 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IS NEEDED AND THAT'S

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:29.365 region:rollup2
WHY THESE ARE POSITION DECISIONS

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.132 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE MADE IN THE BEST

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:31.901 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF THE PATIENT.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:34.070 region:rollup2
IT ALSO PRESCRIBES I INFORMED

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:35.037 region:rollup2
CONSENT LANGUAGE OR WHAT NEEDS

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.639 region:rollup2
TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:37.206 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE FEEL LIKE THAT'S

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:38.107 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.342 region:rollup2
ASIDE.

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:41.143 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS NEEDS TO BE PATIENT

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:42.712 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC AND THE POSITION NEEDS

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:43.846 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:45.081 region:rollup2
ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE RELEVANT

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:45.614 region:rollup2
TO THAT PATIENT THE OTHER

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:46.949 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS THEY MIGHT BE

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:49.251 region:rollup2
TAKING.

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:50.686 region:rollup2
BUT SETTING A STANDARD FOR WHAT

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:52.555 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HAS TO BE IN THAT

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:54.190 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION PLAN WE WOULD SAY

01:14:52.555 --> 01:14:56.158 region:rollup2

IT IS A REMINDER TO US THE WORK

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:51.814 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO DO IN OUR STATE

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.381 region:rollup2
TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOU AND

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:53.516 region:rollup2
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.284 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

01:15:53.516 --> 01:15:57.920 region:rollup2
SO VERY IMPRESSED BY IT.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:59.889 region:rollup2
TO THE QUESTIONS OF THE

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.956 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION REYES ACTUALLY THINK

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.291 region:rollup2
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR HIM SEEM

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.792 region:rollup2
IS REPRESENTED.

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.859 region:rollup2
ON THE INFORMED CONSENT

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:06.128 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:07.063 region:rollup2
.

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:09.331 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:10.132 region:rollup2
PREVENTS THE DOCTOR FROM GIVING

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:12.001 region:rollup2
ALL THE CONSENT THAT YOU JUST

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:13.269 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:15.805 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT WHEN THEY COULD

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:17.807 region:rollup2
STILL DO ALL THAT YOU JUST SAID

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:19.108 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SPELL. LIST THAT'S HOW

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:21.043 region:rollup2
I READ IT MAYBE I SHOULD ASK THE

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:22.711 region:rollup2
AUTHOR YES YES YES IT DOES AND

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:23.813 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY CAN SAN ACTUALLY THE

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:25.981 region:rollup2
PURPOSE FOR IT IS BECAUSE IT

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:27.750 region:rollup2
ALSO WERE ADDING TO WHAT THEY'VE

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:29.185 region:rollup2
ARI. THE OPEN SPAN OF WHAT THEY

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.086 region:rollup2
CAN ALREADY ASK YOU CAN CONTINUE

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:31.754 region:rollup2
TO DO THEIR JOB THE WAY THEY'VE

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:34.723 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING THAT PORTION WE JUST

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:37.593 region:rollup2
ALSO ARE ASKING THAT THEY ASK IF

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:39.662 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN PASSED USE OR

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:41.730 region:rollup2
PAST ABUSE APPARENTLY. HELPFUL

01:16:39.662 --> 01:16:43.199 region:rollup2
SO AND IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.033 region:rollup2
TO NOT.

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:44.700 region:rollup2
CITY LOW BAR FOR WHAT IS

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:46.202 region:rollup2
INFORMED CONSENT AND I MAKE SURE

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.170 region:rollup2
THAT THE PHYSICIANS DON'T HAVE

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:49.271 region:rollup2
THEIR HANDS TIED THAT'S ALL THE

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:52.007 region:rollup2
CADENCE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:53.008 region:rollup2
AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.509 region:rollup2
ANY IDEAS THAT MISTER DALI IS A

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:54.410 region:rollup2
CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL

01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:56.712 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS A FAIRLY RURAL PART

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:57.713 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE. AND SO I I FIND

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:59.081 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:01.250 region:rollup2
NO WORTHY BUT ADD TO THAT POINT

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:02.184 region:rollup2
HAVE THOSE WHO CANNOT EASILY GET

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:03.486 region:rollup2
TO EIGHT PHYSICALLY TO A

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:05.020 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN.

01:17:03.486 --> 01:17:06.956 region:rollup2
SO NOT THE CASE YOU CAN OFTEN

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:09.692 region:rollup2
CALL YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHERWISE

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:10.726 region:rollup2
WOULD WITH ANYTHING STOP THAT

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:12.528 region:rollup2
SUPERMARKET BECAUSE OF THE

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:14.530 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE OF DRUG YOU CAN CALL IN

01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:15.331 region:rollup2
CAN YOU CAN'T CALLING HOWEVER I

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:17.366 region:rollup2
WILL BE SUPER CLEAR THAT THAT.

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:18.767 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES ALLOW DOCTORS TO

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:19.902 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE MORE THAN FIVE DAYS IF

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:20.436 region:rollup2
THEY FELT IT WAS MEDICALLY

01:17:19.902 --> 01:17:22.738 region:rollup2
NECESSARY SO LONG AS IT IS

01:17:20.436 --> 01:17:25.374 region:rollup2
NOTED.

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:26.642 region:rollup2
IN THE MEDICAL RECORD.

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:29.078 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T IF IT IS

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:30.379 region:rollup2
MEDICALLY NECESSARY GOT OKAY I'M

01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:30.980 region:rollup2
THINK YOU KNOW I REALLY THE

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.715 region:rollup2
STATUS WHEN CAREFULLY BECAUSE

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.184 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE OVERLY

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:37.253 region:rollup2
RIGID. BUT AS YOU KNOW PARENTS

01:17:35.184 --> 01:17:38.621 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS I AM

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:39.655 region:rollup2
TERRIFIED AT THE PROSPECT THAT

01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:40.723 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:42.491 region:rollup2
TO THEM OBVIOUSLY THE INJURY TO

01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:45.160 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH BUT THEN THE

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:46.896 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL LIFELONG FAX.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.830 region:rollup2
SO I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT YOUR

01:17:46.896 --> 01:17:48.731 region:rollup2
BILL THINKING.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.231 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SOMEONE BAKER

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:51.200 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:52.868 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.469 region:rollup2
BUT MR BLUE.

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:56.505 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPOSITION.

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:58.340 region:rollup2
.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.942 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CAN YOU EXPLAIN JUST

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.477 region:rollup2
ON THAT NARROW POINT OF THE.

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:04.780 region:rollup2
FIVE DAYS IF THERE'S.

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:06.015 region:rollup2
A AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOCTOR TO.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.883 region:rollup2
PLACED IN THE RECORD A NOTATION

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:08.484 region:rollup2
THAT WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WOULD

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:10.052 region:rollup2
BE IN THE RECORD ANYWAY THAT

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:12.688 region:rollup2
IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY TO GO

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:15.324 region:rollup2
BEYOND FIVE DAYS. WISER PROBLEM

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:16.692 region:rollup2
JUST ON THAT SPECIFIC PROVISION.

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:18.494 region:rollup2
I THINK SPECIFIC TO THAT THE

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:20.863 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION AT. IS TO THE POINT

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:21.497 region:rollup2
OF.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:23.365 region:rollup2
PUTTING THE PROVIDER IN A PLACE

01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:25.634 region:rollup2
OF LIABILITY BECAUSE IT ASSUMES

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:27.603 region:rollup2
THAT FIVE DAYS IS THE MAX THAT

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:29.004 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY. AND THAT

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:31.307 region:rollup2
GOING ABOVE THAT WOULD BE

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:33.876 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE OR REQUIRES A SPECIFIC

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:34.510 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION OF WHY THEY MIGHT

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:36.111 region:rollup2
NEED TO GO ABOVE THAT. AND IT.

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:37.346 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:38.981 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID IT'S ASSUMING THAT

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:40.249 region:rollup2
FIVE DAYS WOULD BE THE MAX THE

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:41.317 region:rollup2
COULD EVER BE NECESSARY AND THIS

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:42.518 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO PATIENT

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:43.852 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC.

01:18:42.518 --> 01:18:46.855 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD NOT BE WRITTEN INTO

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:47.957 region:rollup2
STATUE OF BECAUSE IT IS NOT.

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:50.025 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO BRIGHT LINE THAT WE

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:51.860 region:rollup2
CAN DRIVE WHAT NUMBER OF DAYS IS

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:53.195 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO EVERY SINGLE PATIENT

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.697 region:rollup2
AND WILL ALWAYS BE SUFFICIENT.

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:56.065 region:rollup2
AND SO CUTTING IT OFF OF FIVE

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:57.1000 region:rollup2
DAYS MINCING AFTER THAT YOU HAVE

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:58.867 region:rollup2
TO DEFEND YOURSELF WE THINK IS

01:18:57.1000 --> 01:19:01.704 region:rollup2
REALLY LEGISLATING THE PRACTICE

01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:03.339 region:rollup2
OF MEDICINE. AND I'M.

01:19:01.704 --> 01:19:05.174 region:rollup2
AND REALLY IT'S JUST NOT

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:06.875 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. AND DOES NOT HAVE

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:08.143 region:rollup2
ANY DATA TO SUPPORT THAT THAT

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:11.313 region:rollup2
WILL BE APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:12.915 region:rollup2
SINGLE PATIENT EVERY TIME.

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:14.617 region:rollup2
IF THEY THE CHAIR I COULD

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:15.084 region:rollup2
RESPOND ABSOLUTE I DOES THIS EDC

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:16.418 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOES GIVE A

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:18.120 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION AND IT IS THREE

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:20.122 region:rollup2
DAYS SO WE HAVE WE HAVE TAKEN

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.324 region:rollup2
THAT INTO ACCOUNT ALSO IF IT

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:25.060 region:rollup2
WEREN'T. NECESSARY WE WOULDN'T

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:26.395 region:rollup2
ALL BE HERE.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.062 region:rollup2
IF WAS A NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:28.230 region:rollup2
SOME HARD AND FAST DECISIONS WE

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:29.131 region:rollup2
REALLY WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.898 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THIS AND QUITE

01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:32.534 region:rollup2
FRANKLY.

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:33.969 region:rollup2
ANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:35.137 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE MOUTH OR TAKE TEN

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:37.706 region:rollup2
YEARS FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:39.008 region:rollup2
BECOME COMMON PRACTICE AND THIS

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:41.276 region:rollup2
EPIDEMIC HAS NINETY ONE DEATHS

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:45.581 region:rollup2
EACH DAY FORTY TWO OF THEM ARE

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:48.651 region:rollup2
FROM PRESCRIBE OPIATES.

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:50.052 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL MEMBERS WISHING SPEAK.

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:52.321 region:rollup2
I COULD JUST CALL MAYBE ASK A

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:54.323 region:rollup2
QUESTION OPPOSITION SO IT IS.

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:56.225 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF US ARE TRYING

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:56.825 region:rollup2
TO APPROACH THIS FROM DIFFERENT

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:58.027 region:rollup2
ANGLES AND.

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:58.727 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A QUESTION BAILEY

01:19:58.027 --> 01:20:00.029 region:rollup2
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ABOUT

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:01.563 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE THIRTY DAY

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:03.032 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION IS OBSOLETE AND

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:04.733 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT.

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:06.101 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU INVOLVED A STEP

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:08.103 region:rollup2
THERAPY WHERE.

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:10.039 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES HEALTH INSURANCE

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:11.373 region:rollup2
PLANS WILL SAY YOU NEED TO TRY

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:12.741 region:rollup2
THIS FIRST THE SECOND IN A

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:14.943 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN WILL GET DOWN TO WHERE

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:15.978 region:rollup2
MAYBE I DON'T FOR. A IS BEST TO

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:18.781 region:rollup2
DECIDE EFFECTS AND THINGS LIKE

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:20.182 region:rollup2
THAT IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION

01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:21.850 region:rollup2
WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY.

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:24.787 region:rollup2
OF BEING INVOLVED WHETHER

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:27.156 region:rollup2
THE THIRD BECAUSE IN MY VIEW.

01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:27.756 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I KNOW WE ALL WORRY

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.257 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE COST OF HEALTH CARE

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:29.458 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:31.160 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE HARM IN IN ISSUING

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:32.661 region:rollup2
FIVE DAYS IN SAYING.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.262 region:rollup2
LET ME CALL YOU FOR FOLLOW UP

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.029 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS MAY

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:36.332 region:rollup2
BE.

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:37.966 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT DRUG IS REQUIRED OR

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:40.002 region:rollup2
ARE HIS.

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:41.804 region:rollup2
ARE YOU WORKING ON ANY OF THESE

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:43.238 region:rollup2
ISSUES ARE IS ANY. INFORMATION

01:20:41.804 --> 01:20:45.641 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF CHANGE WHAT'S GOING

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:47.776 region:rollup2
ON.

01:20:45.641 --> 01:20:49.678 region:rollup2
YES ACTUALLY THERE HAVE BEEN

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:51.080 region:rollup2
GREAT CHANGES THAT POSITIONS

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:53.048 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE IMPROVE PRESCRIBERS OF

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.350 region:rollup2
MAINE. I'M OVER THE YEARS IN

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:56.018 region:rollup2
THEIR PRESCRIBING PRACTICES

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:57.619 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN TWO YEARS AWARE

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:59.621 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY A FEW

01:20:57.619 --> 01:21:01.156 region:rollup2
STATES THAT HAS NOT HAD. AN

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:03.125 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:05.360 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY. I'M

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:08.030 region:rollup2
DOWN TRENDING WE HAVE SOME OF

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.697 region:rollup2
THE LOWEST PER CAPITA I'VE

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:10.232 region:rollup2
OPIOID PRESCRIPTION PRESCRIBING.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.800 region:rollup2
AND.

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:13.535 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.770 region:rollup2
POSITIONS ARE TAKING THIS VERY

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:16.171 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY AND HAVE CHANGED THEIR

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:17.606 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING PRACTICES HAVE

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:18.674 region:rollup2
STARTED WORKING WITH. YOU KNOW

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.708 region:rollup2
LET'S TRY OTHER MEDICATIONS

01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:20.242 region:rollup2
FIRST AND SEE IF THIS IS

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:22.678 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY WHEN

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:24.146 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:25.814 region:rollup2
THEY MAY HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:27.349 region:rollup2
HAVE A STRONGER MEDICATION

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:28.884 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR YERS

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:30.619 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN TASKED WITH MAKING

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:31.186 region:rollup2
FOR THEY APPROPRIATELY TREAT

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.755 region:rollup2
PAIN AND DO NOT UNDER TREAT

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:34.590 region:rollup2
PAIN.

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:36.558 region:rollup2
SO COMING BACK FROM THAT AS

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:37.860 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT THAT HAS BEEN

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:39.495 region:rollup2
DONE ON THE THE PROVIDER

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.562 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY OR BY THE PROVIDER

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:42.164 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:45.067 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WOULD ASK THAT WE ARE

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:46.702 region:rollup2
ALLOWED. CONTINUED DOING THAT AS

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:48.904 region:rollup2
AND MAKING THOSE DIFFERENT

01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:49.772 region:rollup2
CHANGES AND CONTINUE SEEING IT

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.807 region:rollup2
AND THE DATA AS IT'S REPORTED.

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:55.244 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:21:51.807 --> 01:21:57.513 region:rollup2
AND SO SETTING SOMETHING LIKE A.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:58.080 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST SOLID MIND AS TO WHERE

01:21:57.513 --> 01:21:58.413 region:rollup2
YOU CAN PRESCRIBE AND WHAT'S

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.149 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:01.984 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN ITS JUST

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:03.118 region:rollup2
NOT THE WAY TO GET THERE AND

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:04.887 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO EVERY

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:06.588 region:rollup2
PATIENT. THAT. THEY DON'T ALWAYS

01:22:04.887 --> 01:22:09.158 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO CALL

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:10.959 region:rollup2
THEIR POSITION AND. YOU KNOW I

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:11.794 region:rollup2
FIVE DAYS AND SAY CAN MAKE MEN

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:13.262 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T WORKING FOR ME I

01:22:11.794 --> 01:22:14.663 region:rollup2
THINK IN AN IDEAL SITUATION THAT

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:16.265 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GREAT BUT I DON'T THINK

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:19.435 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY PATIENT HAS THAT WITH

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:20.869 region:rollup2
THEIR PHYSICIAN. AND SO. IT'S

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:22.971 region:rollup2
THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS WHERE.

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:24.006 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DETERMINE

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:26.241 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO

01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:27.543 region:rollup2
FOLLOW PATIENTS AND WE CAN'T

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:28.444 region:rollup2
JUST SAY THAT.

01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:30.612 region:rollup2
THE BEST KNOW BEST CASE SCENARIO

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:32.047 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT. IS THE WAY TO TREAT

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:34.183 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:35.584 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THAT WILL DEFINITELY

01:22:34.183 --> 01:22:38.320 region:rollup2
HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF

01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:38.954 region:rollup2
I END AND YOU GUYS ARE DIFFICULT

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.888 region:rollup2
POSITIONS BECAUSE WE PLATFORM SO

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:41.190 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:42.224 region:rollup2
WHERE DOCTORS?

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:43.192 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. TOLD THE AUDIENCE THAT

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:44.827 region:rollup2
IN THE NINETIES WE WERE MANDATED

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:46.128 region:rollup2
TO TREAT PAIN AND IF WE DON'T

01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:48.063 region:rollup2
TREAT PAYING WE WILL GET A BAD

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:48.263 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FROM PATIENTS.

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:49.231 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:51.066 region:rollup2
SO I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE WORKING

01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:53.168 region:rollup2
ON IT MY OWN PERSONAL SITUATION

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:56.205 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:58.173 region:rollup2
BUT MY DAUGHTER FELL OFF BARS AT

01:22:56.205 --> 01:23:00.375 region:rollup2
GYMNASTICS FRACTURED A WILL HAVE

01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:01.410 region:rollup2
A SCOOP PUT AN A CHOCK. AND WHEN

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:02.344 region:rollup2
SHE WOKE UP SHALL DISCOMFORT YOU

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:04.279 region:rollup2
KNOW WE'RE THINKING CHILDREN'S

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:04.913 region:rollup2
TYLENOL THE ONLY THING A NURSE

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.014 region:rollup2
COULD GIVE HER AN EIGHT YEAR OLD

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:07.216 region:rollup2
MORPHINE.

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.217 region:rollup2
AND UP SO OBVIOUSLY WE TURNED

01:23:07.216 --> 01:23:10.319 region:rollup2
THAT DOWN.

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:12.421 region:rollup2
THAT MORPHINE IS SOMETHING YOU

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:13.222 region:rollup2
GET FAR HOSPICE PATIENTS AND.

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:13.822 region:rollup2
DYING SOLDIERS ON THE

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:14.923 region:rollup2
BATTLEFIELD SO I THOUGHT THAT

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.725 region:rollup2
WAS A LITTLE.

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:19.628 region:rollup2
AND I'D NEVER RESEARCH IT TO

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:21.497 region:rollup2
FIND OUT IF THAT WAS AN

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:23.398 region:rollup2
INSURANCE STEAL OUR OR. OR WHAT

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.900 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S A SINGLE LITTLE

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:26.635 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE TO ME BUT.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:27.769 region:rollup2
IF YOU SEE THE BILLS ARE COMING

01:23:26.635 --> 01:23:30.639 region:rollup2
UP TODAY THE CURSED AT A PACE

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:32.574 region:rollup2
CROSS CITY LINES THE DATABASES

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:33.075 region:rollup2
ONE IS PERHAPS TRYING TO DO WHAT

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:33.775 region:rollup2
MR GALLAGHER STRANDED.

01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:34.943 region:rollup2
.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.911 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:37.846 region:rollup2
THINGS WE NEED TO WORK ON AND.

01:23:35.911 --> 01:23:41.216 region:rollup2
SO. THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF MY

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:42.784 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS.

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:44.419 region:rollup2
ON ANY OTHER MEMBERS MISSION

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:46.021 region:rollup2

YES AND I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:50.893 region:rollup2
I I DON'T THINK THE CONCEPT OF

PRESCRIPTION LIMITS LATELY

01:23:50.893 --> 01:23:52.861 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.362 region:rollup2
CRIMES REQUIRE SAFETY AND

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:55.297 region:rollup2
EXCEPTIONAL LEGISLATIVE

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:57.366 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:58.634 region:rollup2
I THINK TO SAY THAT FIVE DAYS

01:23:57.366 --> 01:24:01.436 region:rollup2
CREATES LIABILITIES FOR DOCTORS.

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:02.771 region:rollup2
IT.

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:03.572 region:rollup2
AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A COP OUT

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:06.775 region:rollup2
LOCK SOMEONE HAS TO BE

01:24:03.572 --> 01:24:07.976 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE WHEN THEY PRESCRIBE

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:09.278 region:rollup2

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:46.274 region:rollup2
ISSUED A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER OR

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:48.810 region:rollup2
PLANT TAG. UNLESS THE PLANT IS

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:49.811 region:rollup2
DEEMED MATURE.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.278 region:rollup2
WHICH HAVE DEFINED TO ME THE

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.480 region:rollup2
CANNABIS PLANT THAT IS

01:25:50.278 --> 01:25:53.982 region:rollup2
FLOWERING.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.150 region:rollup2
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER I THINK

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:57.819 region:rollup2
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT STARTS

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:59.521 region:rollup2
PRESENT ANY SOME COMPLEXITY.

01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:01.256 region:rollup2
AS YOU START SEEING PLANTS GROWN

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:03.091 region:rollup2
A CONSUMABLE SCALE IN LARGE

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:05.527 region:rollup2
WAREHOUSE FACILITIES.

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:07.562 region:rollup2
TWENTY DEFY WHICH PLANTS ARE

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:08.830 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MATURE FEAR FLOWERING.

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:11.266 region:rollup2
INVOLVES A LOT OF.

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:12.801 region:rollup2
DILIGENT INSPECTION

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:15.137 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO CHARACTERIZE WHAT'S

01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:17.773 region:rollup2
IN THAT WAREHOUSE.

01:26:15.137 --> 01:26:18.907 region:rollup2
AND SORT SHIP SOME BIRD NOT A

01:26:17.773 --> 01:26:19.941 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:21.510 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF OTHER STATES IS

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:23.512 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE ONLY

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:25.781 region:rollup2
SOLUTION AVAILABLE. WE ARE NOT

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:26.381 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PERSON TO TRY TO

01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:27.449 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT FOR STATE FOR THIS

01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:28.650 region:rollup2
SOUND.

01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:31.286 region:rollup2
CANNABIS GROW CYCLES CAN BE

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:35.557 region:rollup2
NATURAL VIA OUTDOOR SUNLIGHT.

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:36.825 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE MANUFACTURED.

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.426 region:rollup2
USING MIX SLIDER INDOOR LIGHT

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:38.226 region:rollup2
CYCLES.

01:26:37.426 --> 01:26:38.994 region:rollup2
KEEP PLANTS IN A VEGETATIVE NON

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:41.963 region:rollup2
FLOWERING STATE.

01:26:38.994 --> 01:26:43.865 region:rollup2
A.

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:44.800 region:rollup2
WITH THE ABILITY DEMOING DECIDE

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:46.001 region:rollup2
IT'S TIME TO GET A PICTURE AND

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.103 region:rollup2
FLORA YOU CAN SPEED IT UP.

01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:49.805 region:rollup2
BY STEPS THAT THE GORE WILL

01:26:48.103 --> 01:26:51.139 region:rollup2
TAKE.

01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:52.708 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF PLANTS ALLOWED TO

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:54.209 region:rollup2
BE CULTIVATED IS CURRENTLY

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.776 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON THE TYPE OF LICENSE

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:56.545 region:rollup2
ISSUED THE AMOUNT OF CANOPY

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:57.479 region:rollup2

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:59.915 region:rollup2
OF EACH LICENSE ISSUED.

01:26:57.479 --> 01:27:01.216 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:26:59.915 --> 01:27:03.051 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CURRENT REGULATIONS

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:04.119 region:rollup2
ONLY MATURE PLANTS ARE COUNTED

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.320 region:rollup2
TOWARD THE CANOPY SIZE HE'S FOR

01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:07.522 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHAT'S

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.490 region:rollup2
FLOUR AND WHAT'S NOT.

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:09.925 region:rollup2
THIS CREATES A PROBLEM FOR LOCAL

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:10.992 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AS WELL AS LOCAL LAW

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:13.128 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT SORTS A LOGISTICS

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:14.529 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:27:13.128 --> 01:27:15.864 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE THEY NEED TO SEEK TO

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:17.365 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT CANNABIS BUSINESS

01:27:15.864 --> 01:27:18.166 region:rollup2
ARMENIAN ALL THE LEGAL

BE PLUGGED UNDER THE TAG OF THE

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:28.310 region:rollup2
AND HAVING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:30.078 region:rollup2

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:32.180 region:rollup2
SIZE FOR THE GIVEN LICENSE.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:33.949 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.617 region:rollup2
TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:36.718 region:rollup2
FLOWERING AND NON FAR IMPLANTS

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:38.620 region:rollup2
WITHIN A GIVEN FACILITY WHICH

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:40.055 region:rollup2
MAY BE. A VERY CONSIDERABLE SIZE

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:42.023 region:rollup2
EXPANSE.

01:27:40.055 --> 01:27:43.792 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T REALLY SIZE IT UP

01:27:42.023 --> 01:27:45.660 region:rollup2
THAT READILY.

01:27:43.792 --> 01:27:47.062 region:rollup2
ARE. WHERE YOU MAY HAVE HUNDREDS

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.329 region:rollup2
OF PLANTS PER ROOM TIGHTLY PLACE

01:27:47.062 --> 01:27:49.998 region:rollup2
TOGETHER?

01:27:47.329 --> 01:27:51.466 region:rollup2
?

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:53.435 region:rollup2
IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS COLORADO

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:54.569 region:rollup2
WASH IMPLANTS ARE EASILY

01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:57.005 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED BY ME AS MATURE

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:58.607 region:rollup2
PLANTS BY A HEIGHT REQUIREMENT.

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:59.674 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES EIGHT INCHES CAN BE

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:00.442 region:rollup2
GOING AS HIGH AS TWENTY FOUR

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:01.977 region:rollup2
INCHES.

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:04.813 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:28:01.977 --> 01:28:06.114 region:rollup2
SO THIS BILL PROPOSES TO SHORTER

01:28:04.813 --> 01:28:07.582 region:rollup2
RE CALIBRATE HOW WE ARE

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:09.451 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING AND OVERSEEING THIS

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:11.253 region:rollup2
GROWING INDUSTRY.

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:14.222 region:rollup2
BY USING THE STANDARD OF TAGGING

01:28:11.253 --> 01:28:15.657 region:rollup2
PLANTS AT A YOUNG AGE.

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:17.492 region:rollup2
ALLOWING THEM TO BE ASSESSED

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:18.593 region:rollup2
BASED ON THEIR SIZE.

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:20.729 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.996 region:rollup2
DO QUICKLY VISUALLY IN A LARGE

01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:22.864 region:rollup2

.

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:28.637 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY BY

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:30.071 region:rollup2
CHANGING DEFINITION MATURE

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:31.773 region:rollup2
CANNABIS PLANTS TO MEAN ANY

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:34.176 region:rollup2

01:28:34.176 --> 01:28:36.711 region:rollup2
CENTER FLOWERING.

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:38.213 region:rollup2
REQUIRES PLACE WE TAGGED AT AN

EARLIER STAGE

01:28:38.213 --> 01:28:43.451 region:rollup2
AND EASIER TO UNDERSTAND.

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:46.421 region:rollup2
IS YOUR OF IDENTIFY STATE.

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:46.822 region:rollup2
DRAGON ACCORSI ANY OF US THAT

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:49.925 region:rollup2

GO OUT TO THE NURSERY TO BUY

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:53.562 region:rollup2

CELL PLANTS.

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:56.431 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY COMMON NOW TO HAVE

01:28:54.396 --> 01:28:57.499 region:rollup2
LITTLE TAGS PUT ON ALL MANNER OF

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:58.300 region:rollup2
PLANTS IT'S IT.

01:28:57.499 --> 01:28:59.501 region:rollup2
STANDARD TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.569 region:rollup2
RECYCLABLE IT DOESN'T DAMAGE THE

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:02.704 region:rollup2
PLANT.

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:03.772 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY A BUSINESS RETAIN

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:05.006 region:rollup2
IN A LOT OF SETTINGS

01:29:03.772 --> 01:29:06.107 region:rollup2
BUT HERE WE ARE USING FOR A LAW

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:07.943 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE.

COMMERCIAL CANNABIS MARKET WE DO

01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:17.719 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE RULES.

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:19.054 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOW. LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:29:37.973 --> 01:29:40.876 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT NEED.

OPTIONS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:31:00.355 --> 01:31:03.858 region:rollup2

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:49.116 region:rollup2
AND A BILL IS UP IN CONGRESS

FOR THE D. E. TO DEVELOP THEIR

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:45.773 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS. THAT WE HAVE

CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR QUITE

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:53.748 region:rollup2
AWHILE.

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:55.383 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MULTIPLE ON.

01:40:53.748 --> 01:40:56.984 region:rollup2
WAIT THINGS THAT YOU'LL PERSKY

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:59.086 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE IT WILL BENEFIT ANY

01:40:56.984 --> 01:41:00.388 region:rollup2
OPIOID CRISIS IS PART OF THE

01:40:59.086 --> 01:41:02.556 region:rollup2
REASON YOU SEE THIS MOMENTUM

01:41:00.388 --> 01:41:03.958 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY. IS OTHER STATES ARE

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:05.359 region:rollup2
SEEING THIS IS A VALUABLE TOOL

01:41:03.958 --> 01:41:06.494 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS WHAT THEY'RE SEEING

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:08.429 region:rollup2
IN THEIR STATES.

01:41:06.494 --> 01:41:10.765 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE VERY OBVIOUS

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:12.767 region:rollup2
THINGS IS THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE

01:41:10.765 --> 01:41:14.635 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO READ A PRESCRIPTION

01:41:12.767 --> 01:41:16.337 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT MORE LEGIBLE.

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:17.738 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO OCCURS IN THE PHARMACY

01:41:16.337 --> 01:41:19.540 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE INPUTTING THE DATA

01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:21.509 region:rollup2
INTO THE COMPUTER IT WOULD COME

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:23.210 region:rollup2
IN E. PRESCRIBING DIRECTLY INTO

01:41:21.509 --> 01:41:24.445 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM SO NOT ONLY WITH THE

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:27.315 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBER OR MISREAD THE

01:41:24.445 --> 01:41:29.250 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBERS WRITING. NOT OCCUR

01:41:27.315 --> 01:41:30.251 region:rollup2
AT THE PHARMACY ITSELF WOULDN'T

01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:31.852 region:rollup2
ADD ADDITIONAL AIRS WHEN THEY'RE

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:33.120 region:rollup2
IN PUTTING THE INFORMATION INTO

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:34.488 region:rollup2
THE COMPUTER.

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.823 region:rollup2
IT WOULD REDUCE PATIENT WAIT

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:37.358 region:rollup2
TIME BECAUSE PRESCRIPTION WOULD

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:38.826 region:rollup2
ALREADY GO TO THE PHARMACY OF A

01:41:37.358 --> 01:41:40.761 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBERS CHOICE.

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:42.396 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ENABLE FAST RETRIEVAL

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:44.265 region:rollup2
OF RECORDS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:45.666 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN THEIR ELECTRONICALLY.

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:48.235 region:rollup2
IN A PHARMACY WHERE SPACE IS

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:49.870 region:rollup2
VERY COMPACT AND VERY VALUABLE

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:51.405 region:rollup2
IT WILL SIMPLIFY THE RECORD

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:52.673 region:rollup2
STORAGE WE HAVE RECORD

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:54.041 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT REQUIRE RECORD

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:56.043 region:rollup2
BEING KEPT ON THE PREMISES FOR

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:57.244 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS. AND FOR VARIOUS

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:59.347 region:rollup2
THINGS SOMETIMES OF ONE SEVEN OR

01:41:57.244 --> 01:42:00.848 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS AND THAT BECOMES A

01:41:59.347 --> 01:42:04.251 region:rollup2
REAL STORAGE PROBLEM.

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:06.020 region:rollup2
BE ON IT WILL MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:09.056 region:rollup2
THOUGH IT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY

01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:10.858 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO

TWENTY ONE THAT'S

01:46:35.456 --> 01:46:38.559 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS FROM NOW?

01:46:36.924 --> 01:46:40.327 region:rollup2
A LOT OF ELECTRONIC

01:46:38.559 --> 01:46:41.695 region:rollup2
MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEMS ACTUALLY

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:43.197 region:rollup2
ALLOW THIS CAPABILITY MY

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:44.031 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN DOES THAT NOW CAN.

01:46:43.197 --> 01:46:46.300 region:rollup2
AND.

01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:47.568 region:rollup2
WITH SEVEN STATES CURRENTLY ARE

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:49.670 region:rollup2
NINE STATES A CURLY HAVE THIS IN

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:51.171 region:rollup2
PLACE AND ANOTHER SEVENTEEN THAT

01:46:49.670 --> 01:46:53.540 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY CONSIDERING IT.

01:46:51.171 --> 01:46:55.943 region:rollup2
I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS THAT

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:56.844 region:rollup2
THE THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE AND

01:46:55.943 --> 01:46:58.145 region:rollup2
AND MORE AND MORE STATES TO COME

01:46:56.844 --> 01:46:59.346 region:rollup2
ONLINE THE MORE MORE AFFORDABLE

01:46:58.145 --> 01:47:00.714 region:rollup2
BE IT WILL BE EVEN MORE USER

01:46:59.346 --> 01:47:02.449 region:rollup2
FRIENDLY IT WILL BE.

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:05.586 region:rollup2
IN AYE AYE IN ADDITION.

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:06.253 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT THAT PHYSICIANS

01:47:05.586 --> 01:47:08.789 region:rollup2
MAY BE ABLE TO DO THIS THROUGH A

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:14.061 region:rollup2
NAP OR SOMETHING AS WELL.

01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:14.595 region:rollup2
OR A SECURE PORTAL BUT YOU KNOW.

01:47:14.061 --> 01:47:16.196 region:rollup2
I.

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:17.031 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OR HOW FEW

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:18.098 region:rollup2
I SHOULD SAY PHYSICIANS DON'T

01:47:17.031 --> 01:47:19.967 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER.

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:21.635 region:rollup2
IN THIS DAY AND AGE UMP THERE

01:47:19.967 --> 01:47:22.936 region:rollup2
MAY BE ONE OR TWO WERE FEW OUT

01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:24.138 region:rollup2
THERE AND I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT.

BY.

01:47:24.138 --> 01:47:27.007 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IN THE LONG RUN

01:47:25.406 --> 01:47:29.209 region:rollup2
THIS IS MUCH SAFER.

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:31.578 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND MUCH

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:33.147 region:rollup2
BETTER FOR THE CONSUMER GET

ALWAYS.

01:54:36.136 --> 01:54:40.040 region:rollup2
FOR SAY A RETAILER WHICH IS WHAT

01:54:38.305 --> 01:54:42.476 region:rollup2
THE PHARMACIST WOULD BE IT IN

01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.844 region:rollup2
THIS ROLE TO HAVE A EITHER

01:54:42.476 --> 01:54:44.845 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC DEVICE FOR SENATE

01:54:43.844 --> 01:54:47.781 region:rollup2

FRONTLINE HIM TO THE RETAILER

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:56.223 region:rollup2
LINE WHAT FLEXIBILITY AS IT HAVE

01:54:55.489 --> 01:54:58.358 region:rollup2
FOR THE PHARMACIST WHO IS

01:54:56.223 --> 01:54:59.860 region:rollup2
FINDING THESE THINGS ARE MOVING

01:54:58.358 --> 01:55:00.460 region:rollup2
OFF THE SHELVES NOBODY'S?

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:02.596 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IT.

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.764 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT FLEXIBILITY IS

01:55:02.596 --> 01:55:04.364 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ON THE SIDE OF COUPLE

01:55:03.764 --> 01:55:05.766 region:rollup2
OTHER FOUGHT QUESTIONS ON THAT

01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:06.900 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:55:05.766 --> 01:55:07.868 region:rollup2

TYPE GUY APPRECIATED.

01:55:07.868 --> 01:55:12.405 region:rollup2
THE THIS HAS A SENSEI SUNSET SO

01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:14.141 region:rollup2
WE WILL KNOW WHETHER IT'S IT'S

01:55:12.405 --> 01:55:15.776 region:rollup2
HAVING SOME EFFICACY. UP BUT

01:55:14.141 --> 01:55:17.310 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE PHARMACIST

01:55:15.776 --> 01:55:18.845 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A BUNCH OF

01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:20.380 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MODELS.

01:55:18.845 --> 01:55:22.015 region:rollup2
THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST

01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:23.884 region:rollup2
ONE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW PEOPLE

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:25.218 region:rollup2
AND TO SAY HERE IS A WAY TO BE

01:55:23.884 --> 01:55:26.620 region:rollup2
ABLE TO KEEP YOUR DRUGS SAFE.

01:55:25.218 --> 01:55:27.854 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE DISTINCTION IS

01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:28.955 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A WE DON'T

01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:30.123 region:rollup2
HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF SOME OF

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:31.525 region:rollup2
THESE OTHER CLEANING SUPPLIES NO

01:55:30.123 --> 01:55:33.059 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT THEY'RE DANGEROUS

01:55:31.525 --> 01:55:35.996 region:rollup2
AND AND MANY OF THEM HAVE.

01:55:33.059 --> 01:55:37.364 region:rollup2
CHILDPROOF CAPS THIS ONE IS A

01:55:35.996 --> 01:55:38.698 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED

01:55:37.364 --> 01:55:40.367 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TEENAGERS ARE THE ONES

01:55:38.698 --> 01:55:41.101 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LIKELY TO. TO DRINK THE

01:55:40.367 --> 01:55:42.903 region:rollup2
CLEANERS.

01:55:41.101 --> 01:55:45.071 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT

01:55:42.903 --> 01:55:47.107 region:rollup2
WE'RE PROPOSING TEENAGERS CAN

01:55:45.071 --> 01:55:49.042 region:rollup2
GET INTO AS WELL OR IF THEY GET

01:55:47.107 --> 01:55:50.076 region:rollup2
INTO IT THEN THE PARENTS AWARE

01:55:49.042 --> 01:55:51.878 region:rollup2
OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOME OF

01:55:50.076 --> 01:55:52.078 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THEIR. PRODUCT HAS

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:56.416 region:rollup2
BEEN.

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:59.486 region:rollup2
AT. TAKEN IN SOME WAY SO THE

01:55:56.416 --> 01:56:00.587 region:rollup2
IDEA AND IN REALLY WHAT WE'RE

01:55:59.486 --> 01:56:04.391 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR IS AND IT'S AN

01:56:00.587 --> 01:56:06.359 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND AND

01:56:04.391 --> 01:56:10.730 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T. TOLD THE PHARMACISTS

01:56:06.359 --> 01:56:12.933 region:rollup2
HOW THEY HAVE TO. MARKET THIS

01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:15.368 region:rollup2
I'M JUST THAT IT'S AVAILABLE

01:56:12.933 --> 01:56:18.472 region:rollup2
OKAY AND.

01:56:15.368 --> 01:56:19.639 region:rollup2

SCRATCH VERY HELPFUL AND I ALSO

01:56:20.307 --> 01:56:21.374 region:rollup2
HAVE A QUESTION AS TO THE

01:56:20.841 --> 01:56:23.910 region:rollup2
PENALTY.

01:56:21.374 --> 01:56:24.678 region:rollup2
FOR THE PHARMACIST WHO MAY HAVE

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:26.746 region:rollup2
FAIL FOR WHATEVER REASON OF

01:56:24.678 --> 01:56:27.581 region:rollup2

RESTOCK WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS.

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:29.983 region:rollup2

PROVISIONS YOUR CONCERN MAKES

01:56:35.188 --> 01:56:36.323 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY

01:56:35.789 --> 01:56:37.123 region:rollup2

ALMOST HALF OF THEIR OVERALL

02:28:55.527 --> 02:28:58.663 region:rollup2
TIME AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING I

02:28:57.095 --> 02:28:59.898 region:rollup2

COULD BE VERY VERY RIGID AND

02:29:07.806 --> 02:29:10.708 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOURS IS A LOT WHEN IT'S A

02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:13.378 region:rollup2
HALF OF THE REQUIREMENT.

02:29:10.708 --> 02:29:14.979 region:rollup2
SO AND I LIKE A DOCTOR EGGMAN I

02:29:13.378 --> 02:29:16.114 region:rollup2

APPLY AND PERHAPS THE AMOUNT OF

02:29:26.558 --> 02:29:31.229 region:rollup2
TIME. SO THAT WE ARE MAKING SURE

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:33.431 region:rollup2
THAT PHYSICIANS ARE ABLE TO.

02:29:31.229 --> 02:29:34.466 region:rollup2
MEET THEIR HOURS IN OTHER AREAS

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:35.633 region:rollup2
