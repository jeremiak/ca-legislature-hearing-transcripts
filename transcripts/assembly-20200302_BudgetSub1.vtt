00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:17.027
SCALE MOBILE QWERTY FACILITIES.

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:19.229
I'M MORE ARE WE THERE YET- WE

00:43:19.296 --> 00:43:20.965
GET THERE IS THAT SOMETHING SO

00:43:21.031 --> 00:43:22.666
AS YOU KNOW QUARANTINE AND I'M

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:24.601
IN THE WORLD OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:26.337
QUARANTINE HAPPENS BEFORE YOU

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.671
HAVE COMMITTEE EACH MISSION SO

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:30.574
WHAT YOU HAVE ME TRANSIT AND WE

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:31.742
MOVED TO MEDICATION AND THEN

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:35.312
OUR GOAL BECOMES. GOING THE

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:36.146
SPREAD AND SO CORPS ISN'T

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.548
NECESSARILY THE NEXT STOP

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:39.483
HOWEVER I AM I THINK WE ARE

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:40.784
STILL LOOKING AT THE NEED FOR

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:43.253
QUARANTINE AS WE TRY TO SLOW

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.756
THE SPREAD. OF THIS DISEASE AND

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:47.257
SO IF WE- VOTERS COMING AND

00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:49.226
THAT WE KNOW HOW TO EXPOSURE WE

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:50.527
STILL WANT TO QUARANTINE THEM.

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:53.664
BUT THIS DOES NOT- GET BAKER.

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:55.766
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TURNED OUT-

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:58.869
AND ARE MORE PEOPLE. THAT HAVE

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:00.504
ALREADY RETURNED DIVERT

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:04.174
TRAVELERS WHO ARE SELF DURING

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:05.743
THE- SENATE BOMB HOT. PUSHERS

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:10.080
AND ARE STILL BE TRAIN. VERY

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.548
BASIS FOR THEIR FOR DAY. PERIOD

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:13.650
I'M CAN DOWN THE DAYS TO COME

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:14.752
NOT ONCE THEY BECOME POSITIVE

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:15.853
OR THEY WILL NOT ALLOW THEM A

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:16.720
THE BASE OF THAT'S WHY WE WOULD

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:20.391
NEED A QUARANTINE FOR. CARE

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:21.658
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE- OF ANY

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:24.128

PREPARE THIS. I'M IN THE I

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.535

THEY REFUSE TO RESPOND IN

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.284
WRITING AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:54.258
ASKING- LET'S SEE HERE. I THINK

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:55.626
THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS AND

00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:57.694
IN SOME WAYS HARDEN BUILDINGS

00:44:57.761 --> 00:44:59.263
IF WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW OUR

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.532
EASIER AND WE NEED TO HAVE SORT

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:03.267
OF EVALUATE THAT AND ACROSS THE

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:04.668
CONTINUUM OF CARE AND WHAT WE

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:06.970
NEED. NOW AS FAR AS SMALLER

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.605
SCALE PREPARATION ASSISTING

WHICH PERSON PURCHASING NOT.

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:22.686
THE BASICALLY CANCER EXEDRA FOR

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:25.055
PROPER CLEANING AND SANITATION

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:25.656
EQUIPMENT WHAT ARE WE DOING IN

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:28.892

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:49.480
RESOURCE TO HANDLE THIS

LOOKING. FORWARD IN THE

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:56.253
FORESEEABLE FUTURE. I THINK

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.654
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.523

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.336
OTHER WE DON'T LOOK PREGNANT

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.638

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:54.977
IN THE STATE MATCH. THE MARCH

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:56.846

FURTHER INTO THE RESULTS AND WE

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:15.097
MANY OF THESE CHILDREN HAD BEEN

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.867
IN WORK IN THE PAST SO IT'S NOT

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:20.636
TO SIMPLY READ THE CHILDREN TO

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:21.670

WORKED. IT LOOKS LIKE THE SAME

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:42.158
NUMBER BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE TWO

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.193
DIFFERENT YEARS WERE ABLE TO

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.227

ADEQUATELY PRIORITIZED AND CAL

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:23.594
AIM TO ENSURE MEDI CAL AND

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:25.630
ROLLED EASE OUR PROP AT

THAT LITTLE BIT AND HELP TO

LITTLE MORE TO THAT IF YOU

02:28:41.746 --> 02:28:44.048
COULD YEP YES SO I'M CERTAINLY

02:28:44.115 --> 02:28:45.716
NOT THE EXPERT ON CALLAHAM SO

02:28:45.783 --> 02:28:47.385
SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE

02:28:47.451 --> 02:28:48.786

WORK GROUPS THAT BEEN WORKING

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:53.658
ON CAL AIM. I THINK THE POINT

02:28:53.724 --> 02:28:55.960
OF THAT COMMENT IS JUST

02:28:56.027 --> 02:28:57.461
RECOGNIZING THAT IF THE DAY AS

02:28:57.528 --> 02:28:59.630

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:13.911
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT

02:29:13.978 --> 02:29:14.545
IN THE KERN CALENDAR. IN TERMS

02:29:14.612 --> 02:29:16.047
OF. PROVIDING VALUE BASED

02:29:16.113 --> 02:29:17.014
PAYMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS- RECEIVE

02:29:20.384 --> 02:29:22.186
TESTING AND SO. I THINK THE

02:29:22.253 --> 02:29:23.921
IDEA IS THAT IF THE STATE HAD

02:29:23.988 --> 02:29:26.490
ROLLED FORWARD. AS YOU KNOW HAD

02:29:26.557 --> 02:29:29.093
MORE STRATEGIC FOCUS ON THESE

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:31.495
INITIATIVES THAT CAL AIM- WOULD

02:29:31.562 --> 02:29:33.030
HAVE MORE OF A FOCUS ON MAKING

02:29:33.097 --> 02:29:35.066
SURE THAT FOLKS HAVE. ACCESS TO

02:29:35.132 --> 02:29:37.668
THE SERVICES THEY NEED- I MASS

02:29:37.735 --> 02:29:39.804
THAT WE- BRING THAT UP WHEN WE

02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:42.273
HAVE THE HEARING TO SEE- AND

02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:44.442
JUST TO. BE CLEAR FOR THOSE WHO

02:29:44.508 --> 02:29:45.843
ARE WATCHING COLIN IS ALSO

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:47.478
KNOWN AS MEDICAL HEALTHIER

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:50.648
CALIFORNIA FOR ALL- IT IS.

02:29:50.715 --> 02:29:52.283
ACRONYM IS SUPPOSED TO STAND

02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:53.718
FOR ADVANCING IN INNOVATING

02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:56.087
WITHIN MEDI CAL. AND THE GOAL

02:29:56.153 --> 02:30:00.157
IN MANY PARTS IS TO. LEAVE

02:30:00.224 --> 02:30:02.193
DECREASE THE NUMBER OF SILENCE

02:30:02.259 --> 02:30:02.693
WE HAVE BEEN HELD. THIS

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:04.795
INTEGRATION AND SO- I THINK

02:30:04.862 --> 02:30:06.263
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR US

02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:07.264
TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WHEN

THAT HCV IS ASSOCIATED WITH

THAT UNIVERSAL SCREENING COULD

02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:43.987
HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NET BENEFIT

02:42:44.054 --> 02:42:45.555
IN TERMS OF IMPROVED HEALTH

THOSE FOR LOW INCOME UNINSURED

02:42:56.199 --> 02:42:58.034
OR UNDERSERVED. HAD VERY LOW

02:42:58.101 --> 02:43:00.137
RATES OF HCV SCREENING UNDER

02:43:00.203 --> 02:43:01.838
THE PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS

02:43:01.905 --> 02:43:03.707
AND STATED THAT IMPLEMENTATION

02:43:03.773 --> 02:43:05.442
OF A SUCCESSFUL SCREENING MAY

02:43:05.509 --> 02:43:07.644
REQUIRE ADDRESSING. VARIOUS

02:43:07.711 --> 02:43:09.613
BARRIERS TO SCREENING AND

02:43:09.679 --> 02:43:11.515
TREATMENT AND DISEASE AND

02:43:11.581 --> 02:43:14.751
DIVERSE POPULATIONS. SO THE

02:43:14.818 --> 02:43:16.019
INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE ASKING

02:43:16.086 --> 02:43:16.987
FOR TODAY WOULD BEGIN TO AN

02:43:17.053 --> 02:43:18.555
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS

02:43:18.622 --> 02:43:19.823
PARTICULARLY FOR FOLKS WHO ARE

02:43:19.890 --> 02:43:21.625

PREVENTION SERVICES ARE

02:43:22.559 --> 02:43:23.693
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:25.095
YOUNG PEOPLE USING DRUGS WHO

02:43:25.162 --> 02:43:27.297
ARE OFTEN DISENFRANCHISED FROM

02:43:27.364 --> 02:43:28.899
TRADITIONAL RESOURCES AND

02:43:28.965 --> 02:43:30.467
HEALTH CARE NETWORKS AND

02:43:30.534 --> 02:43:32.836
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY STIGMA. A

RECENT REPORT BY THE NATIONAL

02:43:34.204 --> 02:43:36.239
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING

02:43:36.306 --> 02:43:38.475
MEDICINE FOUND THE KEY BARRIER

02:43:38.542 --> 02:43:40.510
TO CARE FOR THOSE USING DRUGS

02:43:40.577 --> 02:43:40.977
WAS STIGMA AND THAT IT

02:43:41.044 --> 02:43:42.279
PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM SEEKING

02:43:42.345 --> 02:43:43.914
IN ACCESSING CARE AND ALSO

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:46.750
AFFECTED EFFECTIVE PROVIDER

02:43:46.816 --> 02:43:48.618
PATIENT RELATIONSHIPS. RESEARCH

02:43:48.685 --> 02:43:49.953
FROM THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION

02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:51.288
FOR THE STEP STUDY OF LIVER

02:43:51.354 --> 02:43:53.089
DISEASES FOUND THAT ADDRESSING

02:43:53.156 --> 02:43:54.624
GAPS IN PREVENTION CARE AMONG

02:43:54.691 --> 02:43:58.328
YOUTH IS ESSENTIAL TO

02:43:58.395 --> 02:43:58.962
ADDRESSING THE HCV EPIDEMIC. SO

02:43:59.029 --> 02:44:00.497
ARE PROPOSED INVESTMENT WOULD

02:44:00.564 --> 02:44:02.465
ALLOW US TO BILL AND SUCCESSFUL

02:44:02.532 --> 02:44:03.600
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS WERE

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:06.570
FUNDED HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN

02:44:06.636 --> 02:44:07.137
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

02:44:07.204 --> 02:44:08.772
AND WE ESTIMATE THAT 95% OF

02:44:08.838 --> 02:44:10.173
THOSE WHO ARE LINKED TO IN

02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:10.941
RETAINING CARE THROUGH THE

02:44:11.007 --> 02:44:13.176
PROJECTS WERE ACTUALLY CURED.
