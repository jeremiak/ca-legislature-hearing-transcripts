THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SO SCARED COMMITTEE. FIRST OFF AGAIN WILL HAVE A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS. FIRST OF ALL SOME REMEMBER OBERNOLTE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE COMMITTEE DAY IN PLACE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRO. SECOND WE HAVE THREE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY. FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. TWENTY FIFTY TWO BONTA AND FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE. AB TWENTY SEVENTY SIX RODRIGUEZ ARE ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. KNOW WHAT TAKE OF THE CONSENT CONSENT GALLAGHER. AS SOON AS WE HAVE A QUORUM SO THAT WAS STARTED SUBCOMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BRO ONE GO HERE AND PRESENT. OUR OWN I'M SORRY IF THAT. IT'S ONE OF THOSE MORNINGS. THERE YOU GO. NOT. NOT. GO AHEAD WOULDN'T. UNTIL RECENTLY FIRE PROTECTION AND THE BIG BEAR VALLEY WITHIN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND THE WEST END OF THE VALLEY IT'S BEEN PROVIDED BY THE BIG BEAR LAKE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT. AND ON THE EAST OF THE VALLEY IT'S BEEN PROVIDED BY THE BIG BEAR CITY COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT. SEVERAL YEARS AGO A STUDY WAS DONE THAT REVEALED THAT CONSOLIDATING THOSE AGENCIES INTO ONE ORGANIZATION WOULD RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF BETTER FIRE PROTECTION SERVICE AT LOWER COST TO THE TAXPAYERS AND THEREFORE. BOTH AGENCIES VOTED TO ESTABLISH A NEW JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY CALLED THE BIG BEAR FIRE AUTHORITY. THE PLAN WAS ALWAYS TO TRANSPORT THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE FIRE PROTECTION PERSONNEL IN BOTH OF THE AGENCIES TO THE NEW AUTHORITY BUT ONE IMPEDIMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THE TWO AGENCIES UTILIZE DIFFERENT RETIREMENT AGENCIES. YEAH I THE FIRE THOUGHT THE OF FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT UTILIZES THE SAME MARINO COUNTY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT AGENCY OR S. B. SARAH. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICTS PERSONNEL ARE WITH PURRS SO SEVERAL YEARS AGO I AUTHORED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT TO TRANSFER ITS PURRS CURRENT PURSE PERSONNEL TO THE FIRE AUTHORITY. AND THE S. B. SARAH SYSTEM WITHOUT THE OUR EMPLOYMENT THE. TERMINATION LIABILITY. AND THAT. WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR HOWEVER RECENTLY A NEW IMPEDIMENT HAS ARISEN AND. APPARENTLY STATE LAW PROHIBITS THIS BE SIERRA FROM TRANSFERRING ITS EMPLOYEES FROM THE. A FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT TO THE FIRE AUTHORITY WITHOUT IMPOSITION OF TERMINATION LIABILITY EVEN THOUGH BOTH AGENCIES ARE STAR WITH S. B. SARAH SO THIS BILL AB TWO THOUSAND FOUR CLARIFIES THAT THE. AGENCY MAY TRANSFER THOSE EMPLOYEES TO THE NEWLY CREATED AUTHORITY WITHOUT TERMINATION LIABILITY THIS WILL RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF HIGHER QUALITY FIRE SERVICE TO MY CONSTITUENTS AT LOWER COST THE TAXPAYERS AND I HOPE IT'S WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO THOUSAND FOUR TODAY IS JEFF WILLIS HE IS CHIEF OF THE NEW BIG BEAR LAKE FIRE OR THE. NEW BIG BEAR FIRE AUTHORITY. JEFF WILLIS. RIGHT SO JUST DOES THE BACK UP BUT AT SOME MENTAL PART OBERNOLTE SAID IS THIS IS BETTER. A WORK IN PROGRESS FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN KNOWN BY THE GOVERNING BOARDS THAT YOU KNOW THE TRANSFER PERSONNEL AND AND ALL THAT GOES WITH IT IS PUBLIC THE LARGEST HURDLE TO OVERCOME I FEEL STRONGLY. TO TODAY THAT THAT WILL PASS PIECE OF ASSEMBLY BILL RIGHT HERE THAT TO WILL BUILD ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL. THAT WE'VE BEEN IN PURSUIT OF FOR NEARLY SIX SEVEN YEARS SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAY ALSO ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. SO WITH THAT THAT WE HAVE A QUORUM. SO WHAT SECTORS LIKE KALRA BEFORE CONTINUE.

THE QUESTION THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN THE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE FAILURE OF THE JPA LAST YEAR BUT I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH. THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THIS PARTICULAR JPA. AND IN THIS CASE OF THE PROTECT THE PROVISION OF FIRE PROTECTION SERVICE IS THAT ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OUR RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE GOVERNMENTS. RIGHT NOW THE EMPLOYMENT THE EMPLOYEES IN THE VARIOUS AGENCIES RETIREMENTS ARE PROTECTED BY THE. OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENCIES AND THE FIRE AUTHORITY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO.
