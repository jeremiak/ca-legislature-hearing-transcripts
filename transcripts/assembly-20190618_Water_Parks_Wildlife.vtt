YEARS WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION.

COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE WE

00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:38.662
SPENT AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:39.296
TIME.

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:42.132
WORKING ON A BILL THAT.

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:43.701

WE HAVE MORE SCIENTISTS WORKING

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:50.941
OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:51.275
IN THE OTHER.

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:53.344
WE SPEND MORE TIME PROTECTING

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.312
CULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:57.047
THAN ANY OTHER -- IN THIS

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:59.383
PARTICULAR INSTANCE IN TESLA WE

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.085
HAVE SPENT MORE TIME THAN ANY

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:02.953
OTHER MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS A

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.322
LEGITIMATE PLACE FOR OFF HIGHWAY

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:06.557
VEHICLE RECREATION.

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.559
HOWEVER THERE IS EXTRAORDINARY

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:10.828
LOCAL OPPOSITION.

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.529
AND IT WILL LIKELY CONTINUE.

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.632
AND AS LONG AS MR GLAZERS IN THE

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:16.233
LEGISLATURE AND AS LONG AS I'M

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.701
ALIVE WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE A

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.770
BILL LIKE THIS INTRODUCED UNTIL

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:21.672
THERE IS RESOLUTION.

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:23.707
OUR PROBLEM WITH THE BILL IS

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:25.442
THAT THERE IS THE IDEA.

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:28.646
THAT WE WILL HAVE A HEARING AND

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.447
THAT THE STATE PARKS WILL CHANGE

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:31.649
THEIR MIND.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.417
AND SUDDENLY TURN OVER THIS

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:34.952
PLACE THAT IS SET ASIDE FOR OFF

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:37.254
HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION AND

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:38.923
TURN IT OVER TO THE LOCALS.

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:40.591
MY BELIEF IS IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:42.426
DO THAT HEARING.

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:43.527
THEN THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:45.763
CONSEQUENCE FOR THOSE THAT MR

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:48.165
GLAZER SENATOR GLAZER REPRESENTS.

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.934
THE IDEA THAT WE DO THIS HEARING

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.235
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT PARKS

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:53.037
IS DONE EVERYTHING THEY ARE

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:55.306
SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:56.740
THEN WE QUICKLY.

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:58.208
PUT IN THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE

00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.710
RECREATION ACTIVITY AS IT WAS

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:01.545
PROPOSED TO DO THAT WE MOVE

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:02.746
FORWARD.

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:04.148
THAT WE NOT HAVE THIS HEARING IN

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:06.550

FOR MAINTENANCE OF THAT AREA I

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:07.424

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:36.486
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY O'DONNELL

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:38.088

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.457
MILLION ACRES.

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.025

AND OF THE REMAINING BALANCE

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:54.271
THAT'S ON THE BOOKS WE USE LESS

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:57.274
THAN ONE FIFTH. FOUR PEOPLE

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.809
CURRENTLY IN THE STATE.

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:02.212
WE HAVE GREEN SPACE AND IT'S NOT

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:03.980
IN MY DISTRICT IN MY AREA AT

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:05.649
THIS IT ROOM OF THE VALLEY WOULD

00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:08.385
ADD GREEN SPACE TO AN URBAN AREA.

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:10.253
THE HAS BEEN IGNORED THAT HAS

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.756
POOR AIR QUALITY AND VERY LITTLE

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:15.091
GREEN SPACE -- SO THAT'S WHAT I

A TON TO PRESERVE OUR THE

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:25.201
PROBLEM IS WE DIDN'T MAYBE

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:29.005
COULD A PARKED EVERYWHERE THAT

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:30.440
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN FACT IN

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.909
MANY CASES LANDS WERE ACQUIRED

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:34.644
THAT WERE SLATED FOR PARKS IN

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:35.412

GO BACK AND CHECK THE HISTORY

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:39.149
YOU'LL FIND THAT.

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.517
WE TOOK IT AWAY FROM THE PARKS

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:42.586
AND WE PUT HOUSES ON IT.

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:44.187
WE COVERED OVER THAT GREEN SPACE

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:46.089
THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED.

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:47.057

PURPOSES.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:27.203
THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST QUESTION.

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.437
YES SURE I'M HAPPY TO GET TO THE

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:29.138

CUMULATIVE OBJECTIVE FOR EACH

SUPPLIER THIS APPROACH WE FEEL

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:04.425
PROVIDES EACH WATER SUPPLIER THE

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:05.827
FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHICH

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:07.662

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.163
WHAT BASED ON WHAT IS BEST FOR

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.899
THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.901
HOWEVER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN PRIOR

CONSERVATION BILLS SB FIVE FIVE

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:17.639
FIVE DIRECTED D. W. ARE IN THE

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:18.673
WATER BOARD TO PROMULGATE

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.642
REGULATIONS RELATED TO WATER

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:21.576

VOLUMETRIC PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:26.314
BY TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE STATE

01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:27.916
BOARD ADOPTS THESE REGULATIONS

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.150
WATER LOSS WILL BECOME

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:32.387
ENFORCEABLE -- AS A STANDALONE

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:33.788
TARGET UNLIKE ANY OTHER.

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.323
ELEMENT IN THE OBJECTIVE.

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:36.324
THIS MEANS THAT IF A WATER

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:37.859
SUPPLIER MEETS THEIR OBJECTIVE

01:26:37.926 --> 01:26:39.227
BUT CHOOSES TO FOCUS ON

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.762
REDUCTIONS IN OUR WATER USE AND

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:42.063
DOES NOT MEET THEIR WATER LOSS

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:42.931
TARGET.

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:44.132
THEY WOULD FACE AN ENFORCEMENT

01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:45.500
ACTION UNDER THE WATER LOSS

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:47.435
REGULATIONS BUT IF SOME REASON

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:49.170
AN AGENCY DOES NOT MEET THEIR

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:50.371
OBJECTIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:51.806
DIFFICULTY MEETING THE WATER

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.241
LOSS STANDARD THE SUPPLIER COULD

01:26:53.308 --> 01:26:54.542
FACE TWO SIMULTANEOUS

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:56.344
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WERE ONE

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:57.178
VIOLATION.

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.180
OF LET ME BE CLEAR WATER

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:00.882
SUPPLIERS ARE COMMITTED TO WATER

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:03.284
LOSS AND WE WANT TO MEET THE

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.953
OBJECTIVES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:06.054

YOU KNOW AND ACTIVELY REDUCE

01:27:07.989 --> 01:27:09.157
WATER LOSS IT MAKES FINANCIAL

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:15.863
AND OPERATIONAL SENSE TO DO SO.

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:16.431
I'M WE FEEL WATER LOSS IS A

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:17.231
CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THE

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:18.499
OBJECTIVE AND THE CAPTURES A

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.133
SYSTEMS VARIOUS WATER USES BUT

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:19.767
WE DON'T FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:20.735
FOR WATER SYSTEMS TO FACE TO

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.303
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR THE SAME

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.438
VIOLATION.

01:27:23.504 --> 01:27:25.406
WE BELIEVE SB ONE THIRTY FOUR IS

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:26.407
A COMMONSENSE MEASURING

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:27.942

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.303
THE CLEANER UP PLACE WOULD BE TO

AND NOT HAVE IT BE A SEPARATE

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:42.977

THAT LAST LITTLE CLOSER FROM --

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:12.673
MISTER REED -- IS THERE ANY WAY

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.242
TO MAYBE FIND SOME CLARITY.

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:15.743
THE KIND OF DANCING WITH THAT

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:19.180
BALANCE OF OF THE LANGUAGE THERE.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.948
AS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS.

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:22.884
MAYBE TO THE SPONSOR THE LOS

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:26.187
ALSO GO BACK BUT BUT THE THE TH

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.055
A MY MY THINKING IS THAT THAT.

01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:28.689
THEY JUST DON'T READ AND WHAT

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:30.358
WE'VE DONE HERE HOWEVER I DID

01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:30.758
TRY.

01:30:30.825 --> 01:30:32.293
TO MEET THAT STANDARD I DID TRY

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.328
TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE IN THE

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:35.997
PROCESS AND BE HAPPY TO CIRCLE

ACHIEVED THE OBJECTIVE.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:41.335
AND TO CLARIFY THE POSITION.

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:42.770
YEAH AND I THINK THAT THE ISSUE

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:44.605
IS THE FACT THAT -- THE WATER

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:46.307
LOSS REGULATIONS PREDATED THE

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:48.209
CONSERVATION STATUTES SO THERE'S

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:50.144
AN EXISTING PROCESS IN PLACE
