THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY IN THE LICENSE TYPES ACROSS THAT THREE PROFESSIONS. SPECIFICALLY IT SPECIFIES THE STEPS NEEDED TO RENEW AN EXPIRED REGISTRATION. IT EXTENDS THE SAME ACCEPTANCE OF SUPERVISED EXPERIENCE FOR OUT OF STATE MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS AND PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELOR APPLICANTS WHO HAVE BEEN LICENSED IN THEIR HOME STATE FOR MANY YEARS.

I THINK YOU GOING DOCTOR ARAMBULA I JUST WANTED TO VERIFY IT'S NOT CHANGING A FOR THE LCSW WE DON'T BEGIN THE COLLECTION OF OUR HOURS TILL POST MASTER'S DEGREE. THE OTHER TWO. DEGREES ALLOW PEOPLE TO BEGIN COLLECTING THEIR CLINICAL HOURS PRE GRADUATION FOR A MASTER'S DEGREE WHICH IS WHY WE THINK ARE ARE. I LICENSES. THAT WAS SO A COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT OUR YOU'RE NOT LOWERING THE STANDARDS FOR THE LCSW YOU ARE JUST CREATING SOME. EQUITIES ACROSS AFTER THE LICENSE HAS BEEN ISSUED. THAT IS CORRECT WERE NOT WERE NOT ALLOWING THREE DEGREE HOURS FORFOR LCSW APPLICANTS WERE JUST. MAKING SOME CHANGES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING IN OUT OF STATE THAT HAVE A SOCIAL WORK LICENSE OUT OF STATE. THE A THREE THOUSAND THAT IF EVEN LICENSE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS WERE ACCEPTING THOSE HOURS WITHOUT MAKING THEM GO BACK AND EARN IT OUR. AND AND WE HAVE WE SAID WE HAVE SOME ARTICULATION BETWEEN THE LICENSE UP IN FROM OTHER STATES AS WELL AND AND THEIR REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPERVISION OF OURS. DO YOU MEAN THAT. I MEAN FOR THE CLINICAL LICENSE HOW MANY HOURS CAN BE USED WITH IT UNDER GROUP TO PROVISION HOW MANY UNDER INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISION. SO THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED HOURS TOTAL I BELIEVE IT'S SEVENTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. FOR. FOR. A CLINICAL AND I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S NO LIMIT AND IT'S SEVENTEEN HUNDRED CLINICAL HOURS IT CAN BE WHATEVER RAPIST THIRTY TWO HUNDRED TOTAL HOURS THAT ONE MUST UNDERSTOOD FROM CATEGORIES THAT YOU CAN COLLECT THE DATA. YOU HOURS UNDER THE CATEGORY SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE OTHER STATES HOW THE SAME CATEGORIES THEM WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT LICENSURE AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEBTS. IT VARIES. OCC ACROSS STATES BUT A PLAN WILL MAJORITY OF STATES REQUIRE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED HOURS. SOME OF THEM SOME OF THEM HAVE IT IN DIFFERENT WHAT YOU CALL BUT GETS. BUT. WE'VE LOOKED AT THE STANDARDS IT'S ALL VERY SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA THERE'S JUST SOME SOME DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF. WHAT THEY CALL IT OR? WHAT THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ARE BUT I CAN LOOK INTO IT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND AND IT'S MORE INFORMATION IF YOU'D LIKE? THAT I I WOULD LIKE THAT OKAY. AND IT ALL AND ALSO THAN OTHER STATES ALSO DON'T ALLOW. THE COLLECTION OF LICENSURE HOURS PRE MASTER'S DEGREE AND OTHER STATES ARE ALSO OFFER CLINICAL LICENSE FOR BASHERS LEVEL WE'RE NOT TALK ABOUT THAT AT THIS TIME CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT OR NOT.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY NINE TWO ONE A MEASURE TO BRING AWARENESS TO THE BENEFITS OF PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS. KNOWN AS PREP AND POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS PET. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND I'D LIKE TO SAY WERE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THIS BILL IS JOINT AUTHORED WITH ASSEMBLYMAN MIKE GIPSON. AND COOPER WITH SENATOR SCOTT WIENER. PREP IS A HIV AIDS SPECIFIC PREVENTIVE MEDICATION MEN FOR DAILY USE DESPITE PREP SUCCESS IN REDUCING HIV AIDS INFECTION. BY MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE RELUCTANT TO PRESCRIBE PREP BECAUSE THEY LACKED SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE FELT DISCOMFORT OR STIGMA. RELATIVE TO DISCUSSING OR TREATMENT TREATING PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS OR THEY LACK EXPERIENCE. IN PRESCRIBING PREP. ADDITIONALLY THE USE OF PEP WHICH MUST BE ADMINISTERED WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF EXPOSURE. BRITAIN IS WIDELY UNDER UTILIZED EVEN THOUGH PROVIDERS KNOW OF PAM. THEY LACK TRAINING IN PRESCRIBING AND COUNSELING. AS A RESULT THESE LIFESAVING TREATMENTS ARE NOT UTILIZED. TO BRING AWARENESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AB SEVENTEEN NINETY ONE WOULD REQUIRE THE MEDICAL BOARD. OF CALIFORNIA TO CONSIDER COURSES IN PREP AND PET MEDICATION MAINTENANCE AND COUNSELING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CONTINUING EDUCATION. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE AMANDA WALLNER.

PLANT IS NINETY NINE PERCENT EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING. HIV. AND HAVE. SEPARATE DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THE STATE'S PART NAVIGATORS HAVE MADE IT EASIER FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE AT A HIGH RISK OF HIV TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE DRUGS HOWEVER WE STILL SEE MUCH LOWER UPTAKE OF PREP THAN WE WOULD EXPECT AND A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR. THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE I'M BY PROVIDERS I'VE HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA OF ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD TO GO IN AND EDUCATE THEIR OWN PROVIDERS ABOUT WHAT PREP IS. YOU KNOW WHY THEY NEED IT WHY THEY'RE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR IT. AND IN ORDER TO GET TO THE LEVELS OF PREP USE THAT WE NEED TO TO REALIZE THE GOAL OF ENDING AIDS IN THIS GENERATION. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT DOCTORS HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE PREP COMFORTABLY THAT THEY CAN IDENTIFY WHO'S A GOOD CANDIDATE. TO TAKE PROPER WHO'S AT HIGH RISK. FOR AYE FOR GETTING HIV IN THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE PRESCRIBING THAT NOT ONLY WHEN IT'S.

AB TWENTY THREE HUNDRED WOULD AUTHORIZE WOULD AUTHORIZE VETERINARIANS TO FULFILL ALL OR PART OF THEIR SELF STUDY. CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSEWORK ASSOCIATED WITH PRO BONO SPAY AND NEUTER SERVICES VOLUNTARY SPAY NEUTER NEUTER SERVICES FOR CATS AND DOGS HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN PROVEN. AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD IN REDUCING SHELTER AND TAKE A AND EUTHANASIA RATES SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED LAWS REQUIRING MANDATORY ALTERATION OF DOGS AND CATS BUT UNFORTUNATELY COST AS A PRIMARY BARRIER. TO SPAY AND NEUTER SURGERY IN MANY COMMUNITIES. A TWO THOUSAND NINE PEER REVIEWED STUDY BY THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. FOUND THAT SPAY NEUTER RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FOR ANIMALS LIVING AN HOUSEHOLDS EARNING THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS ANNUALLY. FOR THESE LOWER INCOME PET OWNERS HIGH COSTS WERE THE MOST COMMONLY CITED REASON FOR NOT ALL TRADING NOT ALTERING THEIR ANIMALS. THE UNATTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THESE LAWS. IS THE RIGHT WING WHICH MEANT OF A BELOVED FAMILY PET TO A LOCAL SHELTER. DUE TO THE HIGH COST WHICH AND EAT WHICH CAN EASILY GO INTO THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. MATT LAUER VETERINARIANS TO OBTAIN CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDIT. THAT WIL LIKELY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THAT'S WILLING TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES BOTH NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY HAVE SEATS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR PROGRAMS.

HI GOOD MORNING SUSAN RATES OF THE SPCA ON THIS BILL A CONCEPT REALLY ARISES OUT OF OUR EXPERIENCE IN LA COUNTY WHERE WE'VE GOT A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR I'M INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITY THERE WAS A VERY HIGH. SHELTER INTAKE ANIMAL SHELTER INTAKE AND% EUTHANASIA RATE AND LA COUNTY AND WHAT. WE DID WAS WE ACTUALLY PLACE TEAMS ON THE GROUND AT SOME OF THE. SOLDIERS WITH THE LOCK HIGHEST INTAKE IN EUTHANASIA RATES AND THOSE HAPPEN TO BE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE. INTERVENED IN PEOPLE COMING TO THE SHELTER TO. RELINQUISH THEIR PAD WE ASK THEM YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP KEEP YOU TOGETHER WITH YOUR PATH. AND IT TURNS OUT ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED REASONS WAS AND THAT PARTICULAR CASE A MANDATORY SPAY NEUTER LAW THERE AND THE FOLKS JUST REALLY DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO. TIP TIP I'D DO THE SURGERY NOT TO MENTION JUST HAVING ACCESS TO THE SURGERY IN THEIR COMMUNITY IT'S. YA WELL DOCUMENTED THAT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THERE IT REALLY IS A DEARTH OF VETERINARY SERVICES GENERALLY. BUT THEN WHEN YOU ADD THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF HAVING A MANDATORY LAW IN THOSE PARTICULAR CASE SAYS YOU THE GAP REALLY REALLY GROWS AND SO THERE'S REALLY LITTLE TO NO ACCESS. SO THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE LA COUNTY BUT REALLY NATIONALLY WE SEE THE SAME THING. THE STATISTICS SHOW EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF PETS NATIONALLY ARE. SPAYED NEUTERED BUT IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT THAT. STATISTIC FALL TO NINE PERCENT SO I'M WE SEE THIS IN OPPORTUNITY GIVEN ON THE SUCCESS OF THAT NEW JERSEY AND YOUR CLAWS. FOR CALIFORNIA THAT MARY'S AND THAT THAT'S TO GET OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY TO REALLY DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT JUST. DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND THERE'S A FINANCIAL BARRIER THERE THIS CAN REALLY HELP. LIMON PHILLY.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE. WHICH WOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES BY PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE FOR CURRENTLY LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO GAIN MEDICAL TRAINING USING EXISTING TRAINING PROGRAMS WE START OFF BY SAYING I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPT. THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH FURTHER EXPAND ACCESS TO THE LOAN PROGRAM BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME ISSUES WITH THAT. PA PROGRAM FEE CHARGE IN WHICH I SPOKE TO THE CHAIR ABOUT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN THERE'S A RESOLUTION FOR THAT. CALIFORNIA IS FACING A SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN PROVIDE ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. THERE SIMPLY AREN'T ENOUGH GRADUATING PSYCHIATRIST TO MEET CURRENT DEMAND ONE IN FOUR PSYCHIATRISTS POSITION IN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM STATEWIDE OUR BACON AT ANY ONE TIME. SOME ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT DURING ANY ONE YEAR TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WILL BENEFIT FROM MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION OVER THEIR LIFETIME WILL REQUIRE THE SERVICES. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ADDRESS THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF OUR CITIZENS PARTICULAR HER PARTICULARLY AND UNDERSERVED AREAS AND I THINK. I'M SOME OF THE INCIDENTS THE VIOLENCE INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED RECENTLY REALLY UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CRISIS. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE AMEND STATUTES FOR EXISTING SAY PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE MENTAL HEALTH LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAM TO ALLOW DUAL STATUS TRAINEES. MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT IF THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK AND UNDERSERVED RURAL COMMUNITIES. INCREASING OPPORTUNITY FOR LICENSE. PSYCHOTHERAPIST TO GAIN DUAL LICENSURE AS PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS OR PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS WILL HELP. UP FINE AND ATTRACT THEM TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES GROWING THE PSYCHIATRIC WARD WORKFORCE WILL EXPAND THE SERVICES. TWO PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESSES WHICH WILL LEAD TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES FOR APPOINTMENTS AND MARK MOST INPUT MOST IMPORTANTLY. EARLIER EVALUATION AND TREATMENT. TO TAKE STEP A STEP TOWARD CLOSING THE GAP IN ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I ASK FOR YOUR I BOW TO SUPPORT THIS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM EXPANSION. WITH ME TODAY IS RHONDA HAGER FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. MEG. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU.

VERY LITTLE MALE HEALTH SERVICE. IS THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING AN INTEGRATED TEAM BASED CONCEPT AND CARE.

MORE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DO MORE WITH LESS AND SO GETTING PEOPLE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPERTISE AND LICENSURE PRINT CAN ONLY HELP AND AS WE ALSO KNOW IN SOME. COMMUNITIES PEOPLE OFTEN FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SO IT FIRST PRESENTS ITSELF AND MORE PHYSICAL CEMENTITE WAY SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOMEBODY UP SOMETHING ELSE. AND WHILE YOU'RE THERE THERE'S MORE WRAPAROUND SERVICES IT'S THAT THAT THAT CAN ONLY HELP AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT THE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND THEN MAKE SURE IT GETS PAID FOR.

BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST. CONCERNS IT'S BEEN RAISED TO ME RECENTLY IS ON STUDENTS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IT LACK OF THOSE KINDS OF SERVICES ONS SCHOOL SITES BUT.

SEE SOMETHING ARE THEY ARE THEY FEEL SOMETHING THAT THERE'S NO ONE THAT CAN GO TO ANY AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT SERVICES.

A POPULATION WITHOUT AS MANY SERVICES THEN WHAT KIND OF SAFETY THINGS ARE SET UP TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE MEDICATIONS STAY SAFE UNTIL THEY GET INTO THE PATIENT. A WE DID DISCUSS. SAFETY ISSUES AT LENGTH WITH THE BOARD OF PHARMACY AND WE HAVE. TAKEN THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ON SAFETY ISSUES THE MACHINE IS A IS A SECURE. MACHINE IT'S ACCESSIBLE. BITE BY ONLY BY PATIENTS WITH THE PROPER IDENTIFICATION AND THAT INCLUDES THEIR THEIR PRESCRIPTION NUMBERS AND COAT. THE LOADING OF THE MACHINE IS IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE. PROCESS WHERE THERE'S A SEPARATE COMPARTMENT. THAT IS. SHUT OFF FROM THE REST IN THE MACHINE. SO. ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THE. OR. AND AND. THE MACHINE STOCKS ITSELF IT'S VERY SECURE. AS I SAID WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS. THE SAFETY ISSUES AT LENGTH WITH THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. OKAY INTENSO ELEMENT AND THE DISPENSARIES SILICON BY IT ATM DISPENSARY.

AND INITIATED BY A LICENSED PHARMACIST YES AND AND THERE WOULD IS THERE ONLY A THE ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN ARRAY OF OF FAMILIES OF DRUGS TO BE USED IN THIS KIND OF. DISPENSING LOUD AT AT THE PRESENT TIME WE DON'T INTEND TO USE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES IN THE MACHINES THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE SAFETY CONCERNS. BUT THE MACHINE A IS CAPABLE. OF OF HANDLING THEM BUT OF THE FORMULARY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE NEEDS OF THE CLINIC WHERE THE MACHINE IS LOCATED SO SO EACH DISPENSARY WILL HAVE ITS OWN. THE FORMULA IS ONE OKAY. BASED ON BASED ON WHO THEY'RE TREATED RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BY SURPRISE. THANK MISTER JUST OF. A PROCESS QUESTION SO IT WOULD JUST BE. S. B. LIKE A. FOOD VENDING MACHINE WOULD BE OWNED BY THE CLINIC WOULD WITH A LICENSED PHARMACIST COME AND IT OPERATED AS SOME COMMENT WHAT'S THE PROGNOSIS OF THE. BUT NONE UNDER THIS PROCESS THE PHARMACY. WILL OWN AND OPERATE THE MACHINE AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY. AND SECURITY OF THE DRUGS INSIDE. EVERY. EVERY IT'S THE THE THE PROCESS FOR THE PATIENT IS THE SAME AS IF YOU WALK UP TO. A PHARMACY WINDOW. ONLY IN THIS CASE YOU'RE WALKING UP TO A MACHINE THAT ACTUALLY HAS A A VIDEO SCREEN SO YOU CAN SEE. THE PHARMACIST IF YOU IF YOU LIKE. SO IT'S NOT A COME IN OKAY I'M IN THE MOOD FOR THIS DRUG TODAY. YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND THE THEN THE PHARMACY WILL SAY OKAY.
