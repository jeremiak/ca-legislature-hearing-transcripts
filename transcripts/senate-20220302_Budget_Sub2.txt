BEGINNING WITH- AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION NET METERING. EFFORTS AND THE- FIVE P. U. C. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT. GOOD MORNING. QUESTION ONE YOU SAID GOOD MORNING NICE TO SEE YOU. YES HELLO GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS SIMON BAKER I AM THAT INTERIM DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. IT'S A PLEASURE BEING HERE JEREMIH COSTLY AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. HOW TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE CDC'S ROLE MAKING ON NET ENERGY METERING AND JUST AS A POINT OF PROCESS- I DO HAVE A SLIDE IN MY AM I THE ONE TO BE SHARING A SLIDER SO I JUST I GO THROUGH THIS VERBALLY. I THINK IT'S YOU. OKAY GO AHEAD. THAT'S LIKE SHOWING UP. VERY GOOD PERFECT AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY TODAY. OKAY. WHAT IS THAT ENERGY METERING OR NAM NAM AS AN ELECTRIC RATE CHARACTER THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO GENERATE THEIR OWN RENEWABLE ENERGY SO CALLED CUSTOMER GENERATORS TO SERVE THEIR ENERGY NEEDS DIRECTLY ON SITE AND TO RECEIVE A FINANCIAL CREDIT ON THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS FOR ANY SURPLUS ENERGY FED BACK TO THEIR ELECTRIC INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BY EIGHTY THREE TWENTY SEVEN. THE TURF WAS LAST UPDATED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ALIGN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS AND CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. S. DECISION ADOPTING THE CURRENT NANOSTRUCTURE THE COMMISSION STATED ITS INTENTION TO REVISIT THE POLICY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN MAJOR CHANGES TO THE TERROR OR DEFERRED DUE TO THE LACK OF INFORMATION ON THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE CHANGES TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AT THE TIME. AND ALSO BECAUSE RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS WERE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING TO TIME OF USE RATES. SO ON THE SIDE I HAVE- A TIMELINE OF SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS IN THE PRECEDING. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY THE RULE MAKING WAS OPENED. AND THEN IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE OR ALJ PRESIDED OVER A PRE HEARING CONFERENCE WITH THE PARTIES AND THE ASSIGNED COMMISSIONER ISSUED A SCOPING MEMO OF THE ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE PRECEDING. FROM JANUARY TO FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. THE ALJ ISSUED A RULING. WITH A STUDY THAT WE CALLED THE LOOK BACK STUDY WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY A VALUE AND EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT MEDICARE. AND ALSO A WHITE PAPER PROPOSING A SUCCESSOR TARIFF FRAMEWORK. STAKEHOLDERS ARE PARTY'S BEEN SUBMITTED COMMENTS AND REPLY COMMENTS. WORKSHOPS WERE HELD AND THE COMMISSION ADOPTED A DECISION REGARDING GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR A SUCCESSOR CARE. BAN IN MARCH THROUGH AUGUST OF LAST YEAR PARTY SUBMITTED NINETEEN DIFFERENT SUCCESSOR CARE PROPOSALS. THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS PROCEEDING AND WE HAD BROAD PARTICIPATION FROM MANY PARTIES. WE THEN HELP MORE PUBLIC WORKSHOPS AND THE PARTIES PROVIDED THEIR OPENING TESTIMONY AND REBUTTAL TESTIMONY. AND THEN THE A. L. J. POSTED AT TWELVE DAY EVIDENTIARY HEARING PROCESS AND THE PARTIES PROVIDED THEIR OPENING BRIEFS AND REPLY BRIEFS LAST YEAR AT THAT POINT THE EVIDENTIARY RECORD WAS COMPLETED AND THE ALJ DEVELOPED THE PROPOSED DECISION OR P. D. AND E. D. WAS RELEASED FOR COMMENT ON DECEMBER THE THIRTEENTH. SO MOST RECENTLY- PARTIES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING THEIR COMMENTS TO THE PD. AND THE CQC HAS YET TO TAKE UP THE PD ADDY BOATING MEETING. MANY TAKEHOLDERS ON ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE HAVE MADE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIRTY MEETINGS. AND THE COMMISSION CONTINUES INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS ON THE MATTER. COMMISSIONERS ADVISERS HAVE TAKEN DOZENS OF SO CALLED EX PARTE MEETINGS WITH PARTIES AND STAFF HAS MET FREQUENTLY WITH PARTIES TO INFORM THESE DELIBERATIONS. NOW GOING FORWARD TO SEE IF YOU SEE PLANS TO HEAR PARTIES ORAL ARGUMENTS. IN AN ORAL ARGUMENT DATE THAT HAS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED. AND ALSO TO CONSIDER POTENTIAL REVISIONS TO THE PROPOSED DECISION. IF I COMMISSIONER HAS YET TO ANNOUNCE A SPECIFIC TIMELINE FOR A DECISION BUT THE MATTER IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE COMMISSION. THAT WAS THE UPDATE THAT I HAD. FOR TODAY AND BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY ANY QUESTIONS. DOLLAR YOU RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR- THE INFORMATION SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- SO. WHAT I READ IN THE IN THE- INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME WAS THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS THESE RESOURCES AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO. ALL PEOPLE- ACTUALLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE GET. THEY'RE GONNA CHANGE OVER FROM GAS TO ELECTRIC OR IS. HELLO FIVE ON THE WRONG I'M ON THE WRONG ONE SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOLAR- ON THEIR ROOFTOP AREN'T PAYING FOR THE GRID- AT THE SAME RATE TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE SOLAR- AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE THAT THAT'S FAIR TO THE PEOPLE THAT THAT. DON'T HAVE SOLAR. RIGHT. SO THIS IS THE BALANCING ACT THAT- THE COMMISSION IS IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING THROUGH IN THE PRECEDING B. TWENTY THIRTEEN STATUTES- THAT- WE ARE OPERATING WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF- PROVIDES THAT THE ENSURE THAT THE SOLAR MARKET CONTINUES TO GROW SUSTAINABLY. AND ALSO THAT THE- THE COSTS TO NON SOLAR CUSTOMERS IS MINIMIZED AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY DAY- BUT THE CHALLENGE IN THIS PROCEEDING AND- AS I NOTED EARLIER AGAIN JUST AS ROBUST DEBATE ON ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE ABOUT HOW BEST TO. HOW BEST TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE- THE ALJS PROPOSED DECISION. PROPOSES TO- ESTABLISH OUT WHAT'S CALLED A NET BILLING TERRORIST. THAT HAS FOUR KEY COMPONENTS THE FIRST COMPONENT WHICH HEY MATT BILLING CUSTOMERS OR NEW SOLAR CUSTOMERS FOR THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY EXPORT TO THE GRAD BASED ON ITS VALUE TO THE GRAD- CURRENTLY- BAD ENERGY METERING CUSTOMERS ARE ARE PAID ESSENTIALLY THE- RETAIL RATE- FOR- ELECTRICITY AND SO- THE PROPOSED DECISION. I PROPOSES TO PAY BASED ON THE VALUE TO THE GRID AS MEASURED BY THE AVOIDED COST THE UTILITY WOULD OTHERWISE PAY FOR CLEAN ENERGY ELSEWHERE. THE SECOND COMPONENT IS THAT- THE NET BILLING TARIFF WOULD CHARGE- SO NEW SOLAR CUSTOMERS FOR THE ELECTRICITY THEY RECEIVED FROM THE GRAD BASED ON- AT A TIME OF USE TARIFF THAT HAS A HIGH DIFFERENTIAL. WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS IT WOULD INCENTIVIZE THOSE CUSTOMERS TO INSTALL MORE STORAGE- AND DISTORT THE SOLAR ENERGY AND SHIFT THEIR EXPORTS TO LATER IN THE DAY WHEN IT HAS. MORE VALUE TO ALL RATEPAYERS. TEN THIRTY IS THAT IT WILL CREATE A- JUST CHARGE- WHICH HAS BEEN- CALLED OUT THERE IN THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE BY SOME AS A SOLAR TAX- AND THAT WOULD BE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT NET BILLING CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT OF FIXED COSTS OF THE ELECTRIC RED- AS AS NON. SOLAR CUSTOMERS AND THEN OUT FORCEFULLY I'M THAT BILLING TERRACE THAT IS WHAT'S PROPOSED WHAT ARE PROVIDING A MARKET TRANSITION CREDIT OR OR A SUBSIDY THAT THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES FOR TEN YEARS SO THAT THE CUSTOMER CAN PAY BACK THE COST OF THEIR OF THEIR- SOLAR- PLUS STORAGE ENERGY SYSTEM IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS. AND THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO GROW- AND THAT ROOFTOP SOLAR REMAINS ECONOMIC BUT THAT CREDIT WOULD STEP DOWN OVER TIME SO. AS A NEW CUSTOMER- TODAY WOULD GET- WILL GET HIGHER SUBSIDIES AND I KNEW CUSTOMER NEW SOLAR CUSTOMER- NEXT YEAR AND FOLLOWING IT STEPPED DOWN OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. SO THIS IS- HOW THE ALJ HAS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY PROPOSALS THAT ARE ON THE RECORD AND PROCEEDING- BETTER- BEING CONSIDERED. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS. SO WHAT ABOUT THE EGGS COMMERCIAL I GUESS SOLAR IT'S SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO BEAT THEIR THEIR EXCLUDED FROM THIS PROCESS EVEN THOUGH- THERE. GETTING A SUBSIDIZED BASICALLY THEY'RE SUBSIDIZED BY THE LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR HOME. RIGHT SO AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE COMMISSION REVISED ITS NOT ENERGY METERING POLICY- THE APPROACH THAT WAS TAKEN WAS TO- TO ESSENTIALLY LOCK IN THE- THEN THAT ENERGY METERING ARRANGEMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY YEARS. AND THE INTENTION BEHIND THIS WAS THE PART WAS TO PROVIDE SOME STABILITY TO THE MARKET PLACE AND ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS WHEN MAKING AN INVESTMENT THEY- ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A REASONABLE PAY BACK PERIOD. THE PROPOSED DECISION OF THAT MINISTRY OF LAW JUDGE I WOULD PROPOSE TO CHANGE THAT- FROM A TWENTY YEAR- A LOCK IN OF THAT ARRANGEMENT TO A FIFTEEN YEAR AND SO AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS- ON THE EXISTING SOLAR CUSTOMERS WOULD- WOULD. GO ON TO THE- THE NEW MAPS BILLING STRUCTURE. OKAY SERVER MY LAST QUESTION IS I'M VERY FRUSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT. THAT PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD SOLAR ARE PAYING FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN'T CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THEN THERE GET THEIR RATES ARE ACTUALLY GOING OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE GRID. AND THAT FOLKS HAVE SOLAR DON'T SO WHAT IT WHAT IS THE- I GUESS. THE FRUSTRATION COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THERE'S A P. YOU SEE JUST HOW THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY- THE ACTING ON THIS ON THESE ISSUES OR IS THIS JUST GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION. RIGHT SO THE CQC IT. DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY THAT WAS GIVEN IT GIVEN TO IT. UNDER THE TWENTY THIRTEEN STATUTE ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH PROVIDES THE- THE GOVERNANCE FOR THAT NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM. AND WITHIN THAT STATUTE- THE COMMISSION WAS- WAS DIRECTED. TO ACCESS THAT THE COMMISSION MAY REVISE THE- THE TERRACE THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO ACHIEVE A NUMBER OF A JACK OBJECTIVES THAT WERE STALLED OUT IN THE IN THIS- THAT SECTION OF STATUTE WHICH INCLUDED ENSURING THAT THE THAT TERRORISTS- ENSURES THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS CITED RENEWABLE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION MARKET CONTINUES TO GROW SUSTAINABLY AND INCLUDE SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVES. DESIGNED FOR GROWTH AMONG RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT- ENSURED THAT THE TERROR YOU MADE AVAILABLE TO ELIGIBLE CUSTOMER GENERATORS THAT'S BASED ON THE COST AND THE BENEFITS. OF THE RENEWABLE ELECTRICAL GENERATION FACILITY AND THAT THAT TOTAL BENEFITS OF THE TERRORISTS TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OUR PROXIMITY EQUAL TO THE COSTS- IT ALSO AS REGARDS THE POSSIBILITY OF A OF A FIXED CHARGE- FOR SOLAR CUSTOMERS SWITCH AND IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENTS OF THE- DECISION. THE STATUTE PROVIDES THAT- BAD AT ANY SIX CHARGE FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS GENERATORS I SHALL BE AUTHORIZED ONLY IN A RULE MAKING PROCEEDING- AND THAT- THE COMMISSION SHALL ENSURE THAT THOSE I'VE GOT THE CUSTOMER GENERATORS ARE PROVIDE ELECTRIC SERVICE AT RATES THAT ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PARAMETERS THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS- PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION. TO GUIDE OUR PROCESS- ESTABLISHING. A I JUST AND REASONABLE CARE. BUT EVEN THAT THE- COMMENT I WANT TO MAYBE PUT IT IN THE TERMS IT IT. JUST FROM A FROM MY SIDE OF. THE SITUATION IS THAT WE BASICALLY THIS LEGISLATURE GAVE THE POWER TO. THE PC WHICH IS UP APPOINTED. BY THE BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE APPOINTS THOSE FOLKS AND WE GIVE THEM FREE REIGN TO BE ABLE TO GO AND CREATE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE PUT A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE. IS IF YOU HAVE ROFTOP SOLAR OR YOU HAVE SOLAR AND YOU CAN AFFORD IT. THAT YOU'RE GETTING A BENEFIT AND THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD SOLAR OR HAVE THE MEANS TO HAVE SOLAR ARE PAYING FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT. A SOLAR AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY- THE WRONG AND THAT'S OUR TWENTY YEAR CONTRACTS THAT AS WE KNOW- ELECTRICITY RATES ARE SKYROCKETING IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO MANY THINGS A GRID IT'S HASN'T BEEN MAINTAINED. A WILDFIRE AND- JUST QUITE FRANKLY THE COST OF GENERATION AND THE ABILITY TO BILL TO GET WHAT WE- ARE- GET THE AMOUNT THAT WE NEED. AND SO I THINK IT'S- BEHOOVES THE LEGISLATURE TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AND NOT JUST HANDED OVER TO. APPOINTED BODIES- THAT CAN CAN MANIPULATE THIS SO WHY ARE WE EVEN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IF THIS IF THIS IS IT YOUR- AT THE PUC'S LEVEL. SO WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PROCESS RIGHT NOW- OF REACHING A DECISION ON THESE ISSUES AND WE HAVE A ROBUST RECORD THAT HAS BEEN. COLLECTED OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO AS I WAS- OUTLINING EARLIER ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT I THINK THAT. THE COMMISSION- I TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION AS IT FIRST- ESTABLISHED REFORMS TO THE NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND NOW AGAIN AS WE ARE REVIEWING THE MATTER IS TO REALLY HAVE GOOD DATA. TO BE ABLE TO- MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND THAT- AND INFORMED FASHION. AND SO- THE LOOK BACK STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED. AND ENTERED INTO THE RECORD OF THE OF THE PRECEDING THAT WE'RE NOW UNDERTAKING WAS REALLY A KEY PIECE OF THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION. OUT TO THE DEGREE THAT WE HAVE- AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN WE FIRST REVIEWED THE TARIFFS AND SO- WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST RECORD. OUT TODAY TO BE ABLE TO- TO. MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO THAT- THE PROGRAM- BASED ON SOLID INFORMATION. WELL I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IN FUTURE THAT YOU PUT ON. HAVE THE ABILITY. TO AS INFLATION GOES UP WHICH WE'RE SEEING. INFLATION WENT UP SEVEN POINT 7% IN THE LAST YEAR YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT OVER THE NEXT OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. YOU NEED TO HAVE. THE ABILITY FOR INFLATION TO BE CALCULATED INTO THE PROGRAM SO THAT. THE DISADVANTAGED FOLKS THAT YOU. THAT I HEAR ALL DAY LONG ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING HELP IN CALIFORNIA AREN'T PAYING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR HOMES THIS IS REALLY. A TRAGEDY THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE PAYING. A HIGHER RATE. FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS SOLAR SO WE NEED TO PUT IN THE BILL YOU HAVE INFLATION SO THAT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY GETTING. SOLAR ARE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. AND THEY'RE BALANCING THE BOOKS ON THE BACKS OF. HARD WORKING POOR PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WRONG. ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THAT SIR. LET'S FOLLOW UP ON THE LINE OF QUESTIONING THAT THE CENTER HAVE A LEG TO BRING IN THE ALLEY- BECAUSE- I VOTED FOR. AB THREE TWO SEVEN BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND WE CERTAINLY IMPLEMENTED THAT METERING AND ALLOWED FOR A SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS IN IT BUT HOW MUCH LATITUDE DOES THE P. YOU SEE HAVE TO CONTINUE MODIFYING THE NET. ENERGY METERING IDEA OF DIFFERENT CRITERIA THAT THE PC I SHOULD BE USING WHEN THE TERM INTERNET ENERGY METERING STRUCTURE AND SO I THINK THERE'S- OTHER THE EXISTING KIND OF STATUTE INSTRUCTOR DOES GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT CONTINUED TO MAKE CHANGES TO TRY TO COMPLY WITH- KIND OF THE CRITERIA- AND THE STRUCTURE AS OUTLINED BY THE LEGISLATURE. OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE ALWAYS HAS SORT OF THE OPTION TO- CHANGE OR MODIFY THAT. I'M NOT AUTHORITY GOING FORWARD IF IT FEELS LIKE SHE NEEDS TO UPDATE THAT IN ORDER TO KIND OF ACHIEVED A DIFFERENT MIX OF BALANCE OF POLICY GOALS AND SO- THAT'S CERTAINLY SORT OF AN OPTION THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO CHANGE BUT WE THINK THAT- ORDER STATUS OF THE CURRENT. STRUCTURE SORT OF YOU KNOW PROVIDES DIFFERENT CRITERIA FOR EACH OF THE COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH THE STRUCTURE AND AS MISTER BAKER MENTIONS REALLY DOES KIND OF INVOLVED THIS SORT OF BALANCING OF DIFFERENCE- GOALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS LAID OUT FOR THE PC. WHEN ESTABLISHING A TERRORIST. I GUESS THE- IS DOES THIS DEBATE ON THEM REALLY TO BE A ZERO SUM GAME. DOES IT DOES IT DOES DO WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW THERE ARE BENEFITS OF HAVING ROOFTOP SOLAR. FOR A CLEANER ENERGY MIX THAT WE HAPPENED INFORMATION BEFORE THE P. YOU SEE OF THE- ADVANTAGES THAT WE'VE HAD- BUT IS IT POSSIBLE. TO DO MORE FOR LOW INCOME- THE COMMUNITIES IF THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS. MY COLLEAGUE- AND MOVE THE INDUSTRY IN A IN A REGIMEN OF MATTER TO- AVOID THIS AVOID THE COSTS. THAT WE THAT WE HAVE THAT DOESN'T REALLY. AT LEAST WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS GONNA BE THEDEATH KNELL TO THE- TO THE INDUSTRY. YES SIR IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE. THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS AND MOVE GRADUALLY. I MEAN I THINK- I THINK IT ALL KIND OF COMES DOWN TO BALANCING I MEAN THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENT WAYS- TO KIND OF STRUCTURE PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT YOU TRY TO AVOID SOME OF THE- KIND OF SHIFTING COSTS TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND KIND OF ESTABLISH A STRUCTURE FOR THAT AND THEN THERE'S THERE COULD BE SORT OF ROOM FOR A NOTHER DISCUSSION THAT'S RELATED ALSO ON KIND OF HOW TO PROMOTE SOLAR ON LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR EXAMPLE AND SO ANY KIND OF A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION COMES DOWN TO. YOU KNOW WHAT SH FINANCING STRUCTURE YOU WANT TO USE TO TRY TO PROMOTE- AN INCREASE IN SOLAR ADOPTION AND THE SOLAR INDUSTRY- ANY KIND OF ROOFTOP SOLAR AND WHETHER YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO RELY ON KIND OF THE HISTORIC IN EXISTING STRUCTURE OF USING- KIND OF THE NAME TERRORISTS TO DO THAT WHICH DOES HAVE- SOME. POTENTIAL REGRESSIVE EFFECTS VERSUS RELYING ON OTHER KIND OF FINANCING STRUCTURES TO ACHIEVE THOSE TYPES OF- GOALS OF PROMOTING SOLAR. YOU SEE ON THIS AVOIDED COST VALUE DO YOU SEE A GLIDE PATH THAT WE COULD PROCEED OR IS IT JUST. FOR CHANGING UNDER I GUESS UNDER THE AUTHORITY WITH A. B. THREE TWO SEVEN. RIGHT SO- ONE OF THE- THE KEY ASPECTS THAT THAT THAT WE ARE- EXAMINING IS HOW TO BRING THE- I'LL MOUNT THAT IS PAID TO THE- BEST SOLAR CUSTOMERS ARE CLOSER TO WHAT THE VALUE IS FOR ALL ALL RATE PAYERS AND THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT'S BEING EXAMINED IS TO PAY OUT BASED ON OF WHAT IT COSTS- BUT TO- TO GET THAT RIGHT OFF THE BAT IT COULD BE TOO ABRUPT FOR THE FOR THE INDUSTRY TO BEAR FROM THE- ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE- FOR THE- IS THAT- DISTRIBUTED. ROOFTOP SOLAR IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN- THE- YOU KNOW UTILITY SCALE ALTERNATIVE. WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH- WITH EMPLOYEE COSTS AND SO ON TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A COST DIFFERENTIAL THERE YOU KNOW THERE'S A SPOT TO GET THERE. AND SO THEN HOW DO WE HOW DO WE WHY NOT DOWN. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES ARE BEING EXAMINED IN THE PRECEDING OF A SUBSIDY AND THEN- WIND THAT SUBSIDY DOWN OVER TIME YOU YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THIS SIMILARLY AS- THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE- A SUBSIDY PROGRAM FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR AT ONE ONE TIME. AND AND THAT WAS STRUCTURED TO BASICALLY HAVE THE ASSETS TO BE HIGHER- IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN WIND GOES DOWN OVER TIME WITH THE- GOAL OF HAVING THE HISTORY- SEEK. COST EFFICIENCIES AND BRING THE COST OF THE TECHNOLOGY DOWN OVER TIME SO THAT THE SUBSIDIES TO BE REDUCED I MEAN WE DON'T WANT TO EXPERIENCE THAT THE GERMAN- EXPERIMENT RIGHT TO SHUT DOWN ALL THEIR NUCLEAR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FOR POLITICAL DECISION AND THEN MOVED TO COLE WE'D LIKE TO YOU KNOW I WHETHER IT'S- REAL OR NOT. WE'RE SAYING THAT WE SHUT DOWN YOU KNOW THE ROOFTOP SOLAR INDUSTRY AND PEOPLE MOVE TO BIO MASS ELECTRICITY THERE'S A THERE THERE THERE I CAN I AM. I LIKE THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE HAVE A WE'RE GOING TO BE DELIVERED CHIP AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A BALANCING ACT BUT THERE'S GREATER BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE- I GUESS SO WHAT'S UP. NEXT I SAW THE GUY WHO SAW THE GRAPH. STAKEHOLDER IN. IT THIS. THIS WE'RE GOING THROUGH BEFORE WE GET TO A FINAL DECISION- HOW HOW IS THAT PROCESS WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD NOW IN MARCH. I GUESS THE TIME LINE. RIGHT SO- THAT THE COMMISSION MAKES ITS ITS FORMAL DECISIONS BASED ON- THE RECORD THAT'S DEVELOPED IN THAT IN A FORMAL PROCEEDING AND SO AS I WAS NOTING PREVIOUSLY- BUT NOT GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OPENING A RULE MAKING AND DEVELOPING A ROBUST RECORD IN IN NOT PROCEEDING AT AND THE RECORD IS NOW- IN ESSENCE- CLOSED- AND SO THE MATTER IS NOW BEFORE THE COMMISSION- AND- PROPOSED DECISION THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE HAS- AND THEN BACK TO THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS. HAS OPTIONS OUR COMMISSIONERS HAVE OPTIONS TO PROPOSE ALTERNATE PROPOSED DECISIONS AND- HORTON OPERATIVE- THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES MAY ALSO. MAKE REVISIONS TO HER PROPOSED DECISION AND SO THOSE ARE ALL THE OPTIONS THAT ARE ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S ALL PART OF THE INTERNAL DELIVERY PROCESS THAT. WE'RE UNDERTAKING RIGHT NOW- AS FAR AS- ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER AND BUT IT'S REALLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING AT PUBLIC MEETINGS. WHERE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN COMING TO OUR PUBLIC MEETINGS AND- AND MAKING THEIR OPINIONS KNOWN BUT AS FAR AS WHAT THAT THE PARTIES HAVE TO STAY ON IN THE PROCEEDING- THAT THAT RECORD HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED. IN ANY IN ANY ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OUR CLIMATE IN TEXAS ALL IT'S BEEN RECEIVED INTO THE RECORD. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT IS ADDED. IT'S TIME THE FEDERAL PROCEEDING IT WHATEVER YOU'VE RECEIVED TO RECEIVE. THAT'S CORRECT AND IT IS A VERY ROBUST RECORD. OKAY TRUMP I KNOW THAT SENATOR STERN HAS WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC HE IS CONTACTED ME HE'S BEEN UNABLE TO APPEAR BECAUSE OF A FAMILY- CIRCUMSTANCE SO HE'S- WE MAY SUBMIT SOME QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP ON ON THIS- BUT THOSE ARE THE PICTURES OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. WE WILL- THIS IS INFORMATIONAL WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. PACKAGE ISSUE NUMBER TWO. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE. SOMEBODY FROM THE AIRPORT MR SIKONG HEN MR BORN FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING- CHURN REMEMBERS IS SERGIO AG O. R. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL ACTUALLY TAKE IT OFF AND THEN I'LL GET OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE AIRPORT AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO BROTHER LIBRARY OUT THE CAMPUS. HELLO IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT- WE COMMITTED ABOUT THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE YEARS OR THEIR MISSION VIEJO COLORATION AND I THINK WE DID- YOU KNOW MARKET CHANGING OF RESTAURANTS RANGING FROM ANY UPGRADE SHRUGGED PRESIDENT WILL BUT THERE IS. TO IT HELLO RATING- AND EQUITABLE ELECTRIFICATION OF PASSENGER VEHICLES AND RAIL ALL COUPLED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCENTIVES FOR IN STATE MANUFACTURING- NOW WOULD BE GOVERNORS BUDGET BROTHER TURNED BACK ADDITIONAL SIX POINT ONE BILLION ONE TIME OVER FIVE YEARS WITH A. BOOK BY COMEDIANS ARE MOST IMPACTED. BRINGING THE TOTAL AND THAT YOU ABOUT AND BILL. OVER SIX YEARS WELL EVEN CONTINUE TO ADVANCE HELLO CLAIM AND CUT. COOL THEY HELP INCREASE PRIVATE SECTOR CONFIDENCE- AND ALSO ENABLE PARTICIPATION IN THE MARKET ALLOWING THAT THEIR MISSION INDUSTRY CAPITAL CAPITALIZED ON SCALE ALL WHILE- HAVING A. A OKAY- ON A DRIVING. OUR DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT EACH. OF CALLUM. MOST POLLUTING SECTOR ALBUM GROUP PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALSO HELP REDUCE THE AGE DEPENDENT ON ALL HOPE YOU. ARE NOW THE BUDGET PROPOSES- TARGET INVESTMENT IN ADVANTAGE AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES INCLUDING. I TO INCREASE ACCESS THE BENEFITS IN TRANSPORTATION AND ALSO MORE THAN DOUBLED THE TARGET OR HEAVY DUTY MARKET COLORATION. AND ALL THE MANAGEMENT DO TIE IT BACK DIRECTLY TOWARD COLLECTIVE THEIR OWN MISSION- VEHICLE MARKET DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY WHICH ORGANIZED THE- EFFORTS AROUND THE FOUR KEY PILLARS I WISH OUR VEHICLES INFRASTRUCTURE END USERS AND ALL THE WORK FORCE- SO WHAT THAT WOULD TURN OVER- DO YOU LIKE HOLLY- REGAL AT THE CALIFORNIA. BOARD TO FURTHER ELABORATE ON SOME. OF THEM THAT WENT WITH WITHIN THE HOUR. ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD MORNING SHOW MEMBER AND THANK YOU TO MR ARGUE ARE FOR THAT INTRODUCTION I'M CRACKLED SINGLE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM ALL SOURCES AND INCENTIVES A CART. I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY MY INTERAGENCY COLLEAGUES TODAY. BUILDING ON THE LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP WITH THE BUDGET LAST YEAR THIS YEAR IS A PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING FOR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO TRANSFORM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND PRIORITIZED ACTIONABLE TRANSITION ENSURING THAT THESE INVESTMENTS SUPPORT ACCESS TO CLEANER TECHNOLOGY FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS BEYOND VEHICLE OWNERSHIP. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE SYSTEM CHANGE BY SUPPORTING COMMUNITY BASED MOBILITY PROJECTS TO LIFT UP PRIORITY POPULATIONS EXPAND THE TRANSPORTATION CHOICES THAT WE NEED INCLUDING BICYCLING WALKING AND TRANSIT. HELP TO TAKE CARS OFF THE ROAD AND MAKE FOR BETTER PLACES. AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR THEIR OWN PUBLIC PROCESS THE CARD. INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY TO UNDERSTAND OR GROW AND GROW OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WITH TRIBAL NATIONS WORLD COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. RECOGNIZING THAT IN ORDER TO REALIZE JUST TRANSITION FOR ALL. H. AND DIFFICULT UNLESS COUNTER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE CARD HELD OVER TWENTY PUBLIC MEETINGS AND DOZENS OF INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS SEEK INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND OUR ANNUAL FUNDING PLAN. WE HELP COMMUNITY LISTENING SESSIONS AND HEARD FROM RESIDENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN UNDERSERVED. WE RECOGNIZE THE OVER COMING YEARS OF NOT HAVING THEIR VOICES HEARD X. INTENTIONAL EFFORT ON OUR PART TO DO BETTER. AND WE'RE BUILDING PROGRAMS THAT SPECIFICALLY MEET THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY COMMUNITIES AND COMMITTED TO DOING MORE IMMEASURABLE CLEARLY DESCRIBED WAYS. CARB STANDS READY TO IMPLEMENT THE FUNNY HOST IN THIS BUDGET. WE'VE ALREADY MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE FUNDING APPROPRIATED IN. THE BUDGET WAS OVER TWELVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ALREADY ALLOCATED TO EXISTING PROJECTS BENEFITING CALIFORNIANS AND MOST OF THE REMAINING FUNDING TO SPEED THE FULLY ALLOCATED. TO PROJECTS THAT OF THIS YEAR'S BATTLE QUICKLY RUN THROUGH JUST ELEMENTS OF THIS PACKAGE. AT LEAST THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THE CARD. FROM MORE THAN DOUBLE THE FUNDING TARGETED FOR HIGHLY POLLUTING HEAVY DUTY. VEHICLES TRANSFORMING THEM TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY WILL EXPAND INVESTMENTS FOCUSED ON PASSENGER VEHICLE INCENTIVES FOR LOW INCOME LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. AND LIFT UP OUR MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THEIR COMMUNITY BASED MOBILITY PROJECTS ULTIMATELY STRENGTHENING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP AND APPLE FIND THE KEY PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT DELIVERING ON BOTH EQUITY AND SCALE. ON THE RUN THROUGH A FEW SPECIFICS FIRST WE HAVE THIS PROPOSAL. COMMENT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INCENTIVES INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMER PURCHASES INCLUDING CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. FINANCING ASSISTANCE BRAND NEW VEHICLE PURCHASES FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS ANOTHER EQUITY PROJECTS FOCUSED ON LOW INCOME YOUR CORNER SHIP WHERE WE KNOW WE NEED TO FOCUS. INCLUDES ZERO EMISSION MOBILITY PROJECTS FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND. OVER FOUR YEARS. TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE. ATTENTION EQUITY PRICE. THANKS CLEAN TRANSPORT OPTION. AND THEREBY REDUCE VEHICLE MY TRAVELED INCREASE ACTS TO ZERO EMISSION WILL. AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. IS LOCALLY DRIVEN PROJECTS RESPOND DIRECTLY TO CRITICAL MOBILITY NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS RESIDENTS WORK IN THE FRONT LINES LOOKED AT PRAIRIE POPULATIONS AND FOR CALLING FOR SYSTEM CHANGE. THESE PROJECTS ALSO CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTIONS INCLUDED IN THE LOW INCOME BARRIER STUDY. FOR OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND BUILD ON THE VISION ADVANCED AND CLEAN CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS. THIS INCLUDES LEGACY PROJECTS LIKE CLEAN MOBILITY OPTIONS THIS IS DANIEL TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROJECT CLEAN THE BUILDING SCHOOLS. AND PROJECTS TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY BASED TRANSPORTATION NEEDS ASSESSMENTS CAPACITY BUILDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OUTREACH WORKFORCE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT. WITH THIS FOR A PROPOSAL AND IN PUBLIC PROCESS I WAS ALSO CONSIDERING BUILDING A PILOT PROGRAM. IN CONSULTATION WITH CAL STAR INCENTIVIZE AND REWARD TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. TO RE PRIORITIZING. THAT WAS SENT EXPANDING TRANCE TO. THAT REDUCE VMT. MINOT STATE CRIME AN GOALS INSTEAD OF ROADWAY EXPANSION PROJECTS THAT INCREASE THE ANTI. BELLS WILL PROJECTS COULD INCLUDE TRANSIT ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION SPECTRUM MOBILITY SERVICES CARSHARING VANPOOLING NEW BIKES OR BIKE SHARING AND OTHER INNOVATIVE INVESTMENTS THAT REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON DRIVING. ULTIMATELY THIS PART OF THE PACKAGE FOCUSES ON TRANSFORMING THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WHAT IS THE BENEFIT EVERYONE. THE NEXT PART OF THE PACKAGE IS A MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY AND OFF ROAD ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND OVER FOUR YEARS TO DEPLOY APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND DRAYAGE TRUCKS THE PROXIMATE LI SEVENTEEN HUNDRED TRANSIT BUSES. PRODUCING HAVY DUTY VEHICLE POLLUTION ACCELERATING ELECTRIFICATION. FOCUSING ON SOURCES THAT POST PARTICULARLY HIGH EXPOSURE RISKS TO COMMUNITIES. THAT INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME I'M GIGI R. F. SUPPORT. ONE THREE ZERO EMISSION CLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT PRESS ARRANGE A VEHICLE CLASSES INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION AND AGRICULTURE. THAT INCLUDES TWENTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND OVER FOUR YEARS TO BE ABLE PORT ELECTRIFICATION. ALL LEVERAGING BOTH BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS BUILT IN CLOSE. COLLABORATION WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION. I THE PACKAGE INCLUDE INVEST IN EMERGING UPPER. FOR CALIFORNIA CITIES THIS IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND TO INVEST IN DEMONSTRATION AND PILOT PROJECTS AND HIGH CARBON SECTORS SUCH AS MARITIME AVIATION LOCOMOTIVES OFFERED APPLICATIONS. NUCLEAR IN PROGRESS. THESE INVESTMENTS COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH THE CC HELP MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS THE HUB OF STAFF MARK CREATION INNOVATION. AND WORKFORCE TRAINING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES BOOK CELEBRATING ZERO EMISSION SOLUTIONS IN THE TOUGHEST RESTATEMENTS THE TRANSPORTATION ECONOMY. OVERALL THIS PACKAGE THAT ADDRESSES EACH ASPECT OF THIS CRITICAL SECTOR LOOKING FOR WAYS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES. TO SUPPORT SYSTEM CHANGE TO ADDRESS HIGH POLLUTION SOURCES AND TO FIND INNOVATION THE FUTURE. WITH THAT I'LL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM. HEAD AND WRESTLE WITH THE EDUCATION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS HANNAH RUSSELL AND I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FUEL TRANSPORTATION DIVISION AUTHENTIC EXPRESSION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROPOSAL WOULD YOU SAY THAT. I WILL FOCUS ON THE PROPOSED ENERGY COMMISSION DOCUMENT ANOTHER COMPLIMENT THE CARBON BOUT THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. AGAIN I WANT TO MENTION THAT WE FOCUS ON EQUITY IN PARTY COMMUNITIES BUT PURPLE CALIFORNIA MUST ABOUT AN EQUITABLE TRANSITION TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE. CAN BENEFIT FROM CLEANER AIR IN OUR COMMUNITY AND NOT LIVE WITH LUCIEN OR THE THOUGHT OF QUOTE. CALIFORNIA ALSO. BENEFIT THE LOWER OPERATING COSTS. HE I WANT TO MENTION ROLE OF THE AND YOU CAN MY CAR AND HOW WE HAVE TO BE VERY COMPLIMENTARY ALL EVERY CONNECTION FOCUSES ON THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT BOTH ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND RIGOROUS ANALYSIS WITH PUBLIC FOLDER AND BUT WE ALSO ENABLE BEITBRIDGE INTEGRATION TO ENSURE THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE. OF THE GREAT. YEAH MAKE KILLED INVESTMENT TRANSPORTATION. OUT RECENTLY EARLIER THIS YEAR WE AWARDED THREE NEW AWARD FOR RENEWABLE AND GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION. AND THEN HAVE YOU KNOW CAR FOCUS ON THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE REGULATIONS. AND WE'RE EXCITED TO CONTINUE THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND ALSO HELP THE CALTRANS BUILDERS AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE MARKET. NATURAL GIVEN OVERVIEW OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION. OF THE PROPOSAL AND AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE STRONG EQUITY FOCUS HERE AND CREATING ACCESS TO HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS. YOU WILL BUILD ON SUCCESSFUL INVESTMENT PROGRAMS AND ALSO PROPOSED NEW WANTS TO TARGET CAT. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT THROUGH MATCH FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND WILL INVEST IN THE PRIVATE MARKET MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE ABOUT. THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS STILL ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO THE RAPID SCALE UP. OF THEIR MISSION CRITICAL. PART I OFTEN FIND THAT WE NEED A MASSIVE SCALE UP AND CHARGING REVEALING A BROKER CAN YOU TAKE OFF FOR TWENTY THIRTY. WHAT WE WANT TWO MILLION. REPORTER LIKE UNIFIED BY TWENTY THIRTY APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND THE TRUCK WE BOUGHT THIS. WHAT GOOD PLANNING YOU CAN'T WILL BE GOOD FOR THE BIG RED AND ADD BENEFICIAL NEW LOW TO MAKE THE GRID MORE EFFICIENT. THERE BY REDUCING ELECTRICITY COSTS FOR ALL RATEPAYERS. CAN ALSO HELP INTEGRATE NEW RENEWABLE AND PROVIDE ONE PARTNER W. THREE TO BUY DIRECT FUNCTIONALITY THAT. CAN NEVER BE MASKED BY GOT A GOAL. THE END OF THE CALL THE ENERGY COMMISSION OF THE- PROPOSAL FOR TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. TO BUILD OUT TARGETS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND ALSO FEEL IMPATIENT FOR HYBRID VEHICLES. ON THE LIGHT SIDE WE FOCUS ON INCREASING ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME DRIVERS AND PARTY CANDIDATE. WE ARE REQUESTING A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS NOT. AT ALL EQUITABLE AT HOME KERR DURING WHICH A COMPETENT BOTH MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS LIKE APARTMENTS. AND ALSO LOW INCOME SINGLE FAMILY HOME. WE KNOW THAT AT HOME CHARGING IS A CHEAPER FUEL COPPER DRIVER. IT'S VERY GREAT FRIENDLY. MORE CONVENIENT YOU ENTER. AND IT IS TO THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO DEPLOY IT A WIDE NETWORK OF PUBLIC CHARTER. WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE CHARGING AT HOME. THEREFORE WE'RE PROPOSING A BROAD NETWORK OF HIGH POWERED BACK ORDER TO CREATE ACCESS FOR EVERYONE. I'M A FOCUS OF THAT PORTION IS ON HIGH POWERED FAST CHARGERS. BUT WE ALSO INCLUDE PUBLIC LEVEL TWO. DEPENDING ON THE U. K. WE WILL INCORPORATE GREAT MEDICATION AFTER. SUCH A COLD BLOODED FISHER ARE DIFFERENT. I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE NEW VEHICLE FAIL. 12% OF THOSE WERE THEIR MISSION CRITICAL THIS IS THE HIGHEST UPTAKE SO FAR WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE RISE UP TAKE IT BY THOSE WHO LIVE IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. ONLY TO BROADEN ACCESS FOR EVERYONE. ON THE MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY FIVE BITS OF TRUCKS AND BUSES AND OTHER VEHICLES. WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR A ONE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE PORTION. AGAIN BOTH FOR LIKE BRICK AND HYDROGEN. AND THIS IS ANOTHER EQUITY INVESTMENT KNOW MEDIUM TO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE AND OUR MISSION AND- DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. WE WANT TO CUT HARMFUL DIESEL POLLUTION. OUT OF THOSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. WOULD YOU START A PENDANT AND POPLITEAL. PROPHETICALLY THE BUDGET FOR WORK- IT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR GREAT TRANSIT. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR A BROAD ARRAY OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROCUREMENT VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT NCLUDING CLEANING CONSTRUCTION AND AGRICULTURE. CREDITED A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TRANSACTION THE STATE COURT'S DETERMINATION. YOU NEED TO MAKE ME AN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT HAD ONE VEHICLE TO DELIVER INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PART DOES. AND A FINAL BUCKET. IS EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES BUCKET FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WILL AGAIN COMPLIMENT CARBON DIOXIDE. AND AVIATION MARINE LOCOMOTIVE AND ALSO AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION. DEVELOPMENT REPRESENT CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING THE INNOVATION PIPELINE AND BRINGING THOSE JOBS. AND INVESTMENT THE CALIFORNIA. NO NEED ROCK MATURE WE'VE ALREADY INTERNATIONAL DOT NET AND THEIR ADDICTION WHAT'S YOUR CARD I DON'T BE A GOAL AND ALSO HYDROGEN. INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE MARINES THAT SPECIAL. CONTINUE TO USE A ROBUST PUBLIC PRODUCT THAT. WHAT A GREAT NIGHT TO FORMER INVESTMENT THAT NOTHING OUT THERE YET. BETTER TECHNICIAN CARBOPLATIN EXCELLENT COLLABORATION PLAN LOCKER ON- TO CONTINUE BRINGING OUR UNIQUE EXPERTISE TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS EVEN BY TRUCK BUT THE DRUG MARKET DOT WAS RUNNING VERY LED BY GO BIZ WHICH ORGANIZES OUR EFFORTS WHILE THE PRIVATE ACTORS PUBLIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND WILL PORT YOUR QUESTION. WE WILL GET TO THOSE QUESTIONS SHORTLY. A LOT OF SHINY PENNIES HERE MISTER REID MR BROWN HAD THE- ALEJO. GOVERNORS AND- A FINANCE DEPARTMENT SAYS HERE'S ALL OUR SHINY PENNIES ON THE NEW PROGRAM SO WE WANT TO HAVE GIVE US FIVE YEARS HAVE NO OVERSIGHT DO YOU HAVE YOUR CAN YOU PROVIDE US WITH SOME INPUT ON YOUR VIEWS. OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS START AGAIN ROSS BROWN WITH THE L. A. O. WE SO WE RELEASED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF PACKAGE LAST WEEKEND SO YOU CAN FIND THAT- COUNCIL AND ALSO SOME- WEBSITE LA O. DOT CA DOT GOV. YOUR GENDER ALSO HIGHLIGHTS KIND OF A LOT OF OUR- COMMENTS AND ANALYSES AS WELL SO I'M NOT TRYING TO JUST TOUCH ON. WHAT I THINK ARE SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE AS A BODY WHICH THIS- YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL AND PACKAGED SO FIRST. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. WHETHER THE BANK OPPOSES MIX OF SPENDING OR A DIFFERENT MIX OF SPENDING KIND OF BEST ACHIEVES LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND ULTIMATELY. ABOUT JALEN CATIONS FOR MOBILE SOURCE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE PROGRAM'S. GONNA DEPEND ON HOW THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES DIFFERENT POLICY GOALS- SO FOR EXAMPLE. FOR MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS. ALL THREE GOALS ONE OR MORE OF THOSE KIND OF THE FALL. YOUR NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. NEAR TERM AIR POLLUTING. OR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS. TAKEALOT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT WHICH IS YOU HAVE SORT OF A GOAL OF KIND OF LONGER TERM GHG AND AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS. AND ENSURING THAT OUR QUALITY BENEFITS ACCRUING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO THERE'S KIND OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POLICY GOALS SO SCARED WITH. WITH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SO- I WANNA JUST MAYBE TRY YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS FIGURE ON PAGE ELEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA SO THIS IS ALL FROM OUR ANALYSIS- AND REALLY THE GOAL IS TO KIND OF TRY TO OUTLINE AGREED TO WHICH DIFFERENT- AT LEAST KIND OF CAR PROGRAMS- HEVS DIFFERENT GOALS AND SOME OF THE INHERENT TRADE OFFS- AND SO INCLUDE SOME OF THE- PROGRAMS THAT ARE PART OF THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE AS WELL AS SOME OTHER. PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THAT PACKAGE THAT ARE THAT ARE FUNDED ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET AND SO. IT REALLY MEANT TO KIND OF LAY OUT SORT OF YOU KNOW WHICH PROGRAMS THAT SHEEP WHICH OF THESE GOALS MOST EFFECTIVELY AND SO. FOR EXAMPLE TO THE EXTENT NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS ARE PRIORITY. AND THAT KIND OF I KNOW. YOU JUST THAT. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. PROGRAMS A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TIME- OTHER PROGRAMS ARE MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TON AND SO THESE ARE. ALL THESE ARE RELATIVELY HIGH COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER REGULATORY PROGRAMS AT THE STATE HAS FOR EXAMPLE SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND BUT- I GET. A COST EFFECTIVENESS ON THE NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE. GAS REDUCTIONS- YOU KNOW MURDOCH IN LOK AIR. ARE PRO SUCH AS FAR AWAY. AND THE FORMER. APPEAR TO BE. A MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER PRO- ON THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS SIDE THIS IS MORE OF A KIND OF A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT BUT- YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH. A PRIORITY ON KIND OF ADVANCING TECHNOLOGIES TO MEET SOME OF THE MORE LONG TERM. GHG AND AIR QUALITY GOALS THEN- THE LEGISLATURE COULD PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR KIND OF HEAVY DUTY PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS AND DOCTORS FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES WHETHER. THE TECHNOLOGY IS MORE ON HOW THE EARLIER STAGE. FINALLY IF A PRIORITY IS REALLY ENSURING THAT THOSE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS ACCRUE MOSTLY TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW TARGETING FUNDS TO PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE. POLLUTANTS COST EFFECTIVE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY AND WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE BENEFITS ARE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE. PROGRAMS RELATIVELY OF ON THEIR THAT MONEY IS SPENT SOME KIND OF PRIORITY POPULATIONS SO. I THINK THAT'S OUR ATTEMPT TO KIND OF JUST MAYBE SORT OF FRAME SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS OF THE LEGISLATURE. FACES DEPENDING ON ITS PRIORITIES AND HOW IT WANTS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING. SO I'M NOT TRY TO RUN THROUGH I'M CONSCIOUS OF TIME HERE JUST A FEW OTHER POINTS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT. ONE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WRECKED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD- AT BUDGET HEARING TODAY ON JUST SOME OF THE DETAILS OF SOME OF THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROPOSED A LOT OF THE FUNDING GOES TO EXISTING PROGRAMS. A COUPLE NEW PROGRAM SO FOR EXAMPLE THE- NEW EQUITABLE AT HOME CHARGING PROGRAM- FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. GRAHAM TARGET PRINTERS- YOU KNOW HOW OLD BENEFICIARIES BE NOTIFIED OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE FUNDS. AND HOW IS THE PROGRAM DIFFERENT FROM OTHER STATE PROGRAMS THAT KIND OF SUPPORT. INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS- ANOTHER ISSUE WE WANTED TO FIGHT IS- AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL FUNDING SO- THE PACKAGE INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION FOR EASY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE- FEDERAL FORMULA. PROGRAM GRANT FORMULA PROGRAMS FROM THE- INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL THREE BILLION NATIONWIDE THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU CHARGING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. THE DETAILS OF THAT HAVEN'T- BEEN SPECIFIED IT'S NOT CLEAR IT'S A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM SO IT'S NOT CLEAR. HOW MUCH CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE BUT WE- WE DO THINK THE LEGISLATURE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT THIS SPRING ON ITS PLAN FOR ENSURING. THAT STATE FUNDING FOR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WILL COMPLEMENT THIS NEW FEDERAL FUNDING. SO COULD INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF HOWSTATE FUNDING CAN BE USED TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE. OR A FILLING MAJOR GAPS IN IN FEDERAL FUNDING. AND AS SUCH IS THERE STILL SORT OF IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL AT THE TIME THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ADOPT THE BUDGET COULD CONSIDER. DELAYING FUNDING UNTIL IT HAS A- CLEAR PICTURE OF HOW STATE. FUNDING COMBUSTIBLE NATURAL SIGNING. AND THE FOURTH IN FIVE THING- WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS- JUST A BEING OF MULTI YEAR ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND THERE REALLY ARE TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING MULTI YEAR OUT YOUR FUNDING WHICH THIS PACKAGE DOES IT PROVIDES OVER THREE BILLION AND- ABOUT YOUR GENERAL FUND COMMITMENTS- SO ON THE ONE HAND. COMMITMENTS CAN PROVIDE. SOME BENEFITS IN PROVIDING MARKET CERTAINTY AND MAKING IT EASIER. FOR DEPARTMENTS TO DESIGN PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTER PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN PROVIDE MARKET CERTAINTY TO BUSINESSES. ARE CONSIDERING LONG TERM INVESTMENTS SUCH AS TRANSITIONING THEIR FLEETS TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND KNOWING THAT THERE'S- GOING TO BE FUNDING AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE- AND ALSO GREATER CERTAINTY EACH- CARD FOR EXAMPLE AN INVESTOR IN THE FUND IN AND DESIGNING PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT. ANOTHER BOY DESTRUCTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT HELPS AVOIDING A WEIGHTLESS GOING FORWARD. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A MULTI YEAR FUNDING PROPOSALS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION. DOESN'T HAVETO COME BACK OUT WITH A KIND OF A NEW BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL NEXT YEAR- AND SO THAT YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE OVERSIGHT THERE ARE SOME WAYS AROUND THAT BY. INCLUDING SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS- BUT ONE THING I THINK THAT'S JUST KIND OF A TRADE OFF OF THAT MULTI YEAR APPROACH THE OTHER OF COURSE IS IT DOES CREATE ADDITIONAL GENERAL GENERAL FUND PRESSURES. IN THE FUTURE YOUR SENSE OF POLITICAL POINT STATUES JUST THINK. ABOUT- ABOUT THAT TRADE OFF. SO BUT TO THE EXTENT THE ONE. DOES PROVIDE KIND OF MULTI YEAR FUNDING PART OF THE PACKAGE WE DO. THAT PRIORITIZE. THAT FOR PROGRAMS WHERE IT KIND OF CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE MARKETS SIGNAL BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES MAKING US LONG TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS SUCH AS HEAVY DUTY. AND OFFER A DOCTRINES. SO I WILL IN MY COMMENTS THERE ARE OF COURSE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF ANY HOUSE. YEAH I'M YOU KNOW I WILL GET TO THE- THE AIRPORT ENDED AND ENERGY COMMISSION. WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT ON FEBRUARY. TWENTY SECOND THE AIRPORT. ISSUED SOME REGULATIONS TO CHANGE THE QUALIFICATIONS ON THE DAY. A C. V. R. P. PROGRAM YOU KNOW WE- THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE. WORKED REALLY. HARD TO GET FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE- MILLION DOLLAR IN THE CV R. P. WHICH IS VERY POPULAR AND- MR RUSSO. MADE A COMMENT ABOUT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES GETTING ENCOURAGING THEM TO BUY. A SOLAR ENERGY IN THE- WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF ARE PUTTING MONEY INTO IT- THE GOVERNOR AGREED TO IT THEY'VE CHANGED THE ELIGIBILITY TO REDUCE. THE ROUTE TO REDUCE IT FROM THREE HUNDRED. THOUSAND FOR A COUPLE TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BASICALLY ELIMINATING A WHOLE GROUP OF MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS WITH VERY LITTLE FANFARE. IN SOMEWHAT OF A BETRAYAL IN MY MIND TO WHAT WHAT. WHAT WE HAD AGREED TO LAST YEAR IN THE THREE POINT NINE AND SOMEHOW. I'M HEARING THAT THAT WAS. LEGISLATIVE INTENT WHICH IS. ANYBODY WHO'S CASUALLY LISTEN TO ME UP HERE ANDTALK ABOUT THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING. NO REBATES AND HAVING CASH ON THE HOOD MUSTA MISSED THAT- BUT- GOOD TO TRADE OFF THAT WE HAVE I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU. IS DO YOU WANT JUST CAME UP WITH A REPORT AND SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE. OUR OUR THE PARIS PROMISE OF KEEPING HEAT- THE TEMPERATURE RISE TO BELOW ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES. THE CELL PACKAGE IN A LOT OF THIS IS A LONG TERM VERSUS SHORT TERM. AND LONG DISTANCE AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES IT DOES AS A REFERENCE AND I SHINY PENNY MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT STUFF BUT DOESN'T DO THE WORK. IF I HAD THE FIFTH YOU'VE SET UP FOR. CRITERIA IF I HAD TO CHOOSE ONE FORCE FOR LEGISLATORS LOOK AT WOULDN'T IT BE THE SHORT TERM- THE BENEFITS THAT WE CAN GET TO THE TABLE THE WORLD DOESN'T HEAT UP RATHER THAN HAVING THIS NET ZERO IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE IF I HAD TO JUST CHOOSE ONE I KNOW ONE BALANCING AND I KNOW I'M SACRIFICING THEIR QUALITY I'M I'M I'M ACTUALLY SAYING IT OUT LOUD. SO THAT THE AIR BOARD IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION CAN HEAR IT DON'T WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REDUCE THE HEATING OF THE GLOBE TO WITHIN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES AND THIS AND THAT YOUR FIRST CRITERIA MISTER. BROWN BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY JUST A POLICY CALLED FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND SO- I THINK DIFFERENT PEOPLE CAN KIND OF SEE YOU KNOW PRIORITIZE. THINGS DIFFERENTLY I MEAN I THINK IT'S- CERTAINLY REASONABLE TO KIND OF HAVE A NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AS A- AS A KIND OF CORE AND KIND OF TOP PRIORITY- BUT I THINK THAT'S KIND AND- NOT SOMETHING THAT KIND OF THE STAFF LEVEL WE CAN KIND OF SAY YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD BE KIND OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE DO THAT IT'S KIND OF A POLICY CALLED THE LEGISLATURE IS TRYING TO. BALANCE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT GOALS AND PRIORITIES BUT- WE DO THAT KIND OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT THOSE ARE AND TRYING TO BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE ABOUT. KIND OF YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH OF THOSE PRIORITIES IS KIND OF REALLY AT THE TOP OF THE LIST AND THEN KIND OF STRUCTURING YOUR BUDGET PACKAGE KIND OF AROUND THAT. MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. SO WE HAVE. THE PRESIDENT'S INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN. DISSECTING SINCE THE SINCE NOVEMBER. AND I'M TRYING TO. DETERMINE WHAT'S THE OVERALL STRATEGY. BUT THE- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AC SOME. PROJECTS ARE EXTENDED. OTHERS ARE DISCONTINUED. BUT DO YOU SEE. ON THIS. THE STRATEGY LINKING LAST YEAR'S THREE POINT NINE WITH THE SIX POINT ONE THAT THE GOVERNORS ASKING FOR. THE BECAUSE I'M GONNA ASK YOU AT THE AIRPORT AND SEE SEE SEE WHAT YOU WERE EXPLICIT DESIGNED TO AUGMENT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. MR BROWN YEAH I CAN DO UP TO THIRTY ONE TAKE THE QUESTION ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT- WITHOUT FOR ALL. I WAS GONNA ASK ROSS FIRST BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT FOR THE FIRST OVERALL STRATEGY FOR GIVEN WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MEAN I THINK IN GENERAL THE STRATEGY CONTINUES HELLO I'M JUST KIND OF PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S PACKAGE SO IT'S KIND OF- YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF EXPANDING THOSE IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE THERE ARE- KIND OF ARE TARGETING SOME NEW- NEW AREAS SO THAT AGAIN THE EQUITABLE AT HOME CHARGING IS KIND OF A- YOU KNOW A NEW FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM IT'S KIND OF ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE- I DO I DO THINK AGAIN IT'S GONNA BE. AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS JUST THESE QUESTIONS ARE. THE PACKAGE FITS IN WITH WHAT FEDERAL FUNDING IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE OR IS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPLORE AND- HOPEFULLY GET SOME CLARIFICATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON KIND OF HOW IT'S THINKING ABOUT. BOTH THE FUNDING THAT THE STATE KNOWS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE AS WELL AS SOME OF THESE OTHER. COSTS OF MONEY THAT ARE- ALLOCATED ON ANY. KIND OF COMPETITIVE BASIS AND SO. THE DETAILS OF THOSE ARE NOT QUITE CLEAR SO I THINK KIND OF THINKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW KIND OF THIS PACKAGE CAN BE STRUCTURED TO ENSURE THAT IT IT KIND OF SNOW CAN COMPLEMENT THAT MONEY AND- THAT'S AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDS AND- IF THERE IS IN GREAT DETAIL- THERE IS. WE'VE BEEN KIND OF A STRONG RATIONALE FOR- FOR THINKING ABOUT NOT WAITING AND KIND OF GET IN MORE DETAIL AND ENSURING THAT THE MONEY THAT STATE IS ALLOCATING. IS IS REALLY KIND OF JUST BEING USED IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE EITHER TO KIND OF LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING OR FILLING GAPS THAT ARE- THAT MIGHT BE THAT- THERE FROM FEDERAL FUNDING. S. S. ROSS WHO IS THERE AN OVERALL. STRATEGY GUIDING. THIS ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. YES STOPS. SO LET ME THINK ON THE FEDERAL P. FIRST AND THEN I CAN HELP HIM TO THE LARGE STRATEGY. ON THE FEDERAL SIDE THERE ARE TWO BUCKETS. THERE'S THE FORMULA GRANT FUNDING. AND A COMPETITIVE GRANT FUNDING. OF THE FORMULA GRANT FUNDING THAT THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION OF WHICH WHICH WILL COME TO CALIFORNIA OVER FIVE YEARS. ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ON FEDERAL GUIDANCE BUT BELIEVE. I WANT TO TAKE THAT REAL LEVIN BUT VERY RECENTLY. WE'VE ALREADY STARTED AGAIN WITH A CALL AND OTHER AGENCIES GREAT A CALIPHATE CALTRANS. AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE WHICH IS FAIRLY LIGHT AT THIS POINT. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SUBMIT PLANS BY THIS SUMMER. AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE APPROVED BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER- THAT FORMULA GRANT FUNDING TO CREATE THAT DIFFICULT WORK WE SPENT. A LOT OF PARAMETERS ON THE POWER. OF THE CHARGERS. AND THEN THEY NEED ALTERNATIVE FUEL CORRIDORS. SO YOU KNOW. THAT ONE IS GOING TO COME TO CALIFORNIA DELLA COMPLEMENT WHAT WE'RE- ASKING FOR HERE. THE OTHER DAY YEAH THE- SO WE CAN BOTH HAVE A ROBUST NETWORK ON THE ALTAR OF BUCCAL CORRIDOR. WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDING. AND THEN ALSO HAVE BEEFED UP THE THEM AND PUBLIC CHARGING. ACROSS THE STATE AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. THIS A BASKETBALL I COMPLETED IT AND REALLY BUILD OUT ALIVE WILL NOT WORK. WE NEED. DO THAT REALLY WELL. HE COULD GRANT HE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION. ACROSS THE NATION WHAT DO TRY TO BRING AS ABOUT HELP. WE A FEDERAL GUIDANCE HAS NOT BEEN REAL ON THE YET. OPEN TO FEED IN THE NEXT MONTHS. THE FEDERAL P. VERY MUCH THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE- LAST YEAR IS 80% FEDERAL FUNDS. AND THEN TWENTY PERCENT- NOT FUNDING WE WANT TO INCREASE THAT LEVEL EVEN MORE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR PROGRAM. TO GET MORE AND MORE PRIVATE INVESTMENT YOU MAKE THE FEDERAL FUNDING IN OUR STATE FUNDING GO EVEN FURTHER. BUT OTHER AREAS. NOW IT SHOULD JUST BE ABOUT THE PACKAGING A WHOLE OUR STRATEGY AROUND THIS BOOK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BUILT UPON MY- PACKAGE. ON INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE- WHAT WE'RE FORTUNATE TO GET FROM A LOT OF BLOOD PRESSURE AND THE FATE OF THE PURPLE BOX HERE. WELL PROTECTED TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS- BUT WE KNOW WE NEED TO CONTINUE DOING MORE IN THE EQUITY. THE BLACK CHARGE. A BROADER. PCS NETWORK AND YOUR POINT BEING. A MEDIA. CURRENTLY YOU CAN BE DOING IN A LONG TERM BASICALLY DOING REALLY PLAYS A FACTOR CREATING ACCESS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND VEHICLE PURCHASES SO WE CAN START GETTING PEOPLE TO THERE MUST BE A CULTURE TODAY I FEEL LIKE EVERY PURCHASE THAT NOT OF THEIR MAKING VEHICLE SUCH ANOTHER VEHICLE ON THE ROAD TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS- SO WE WANT TO TALK TO ALL OF THAT BUT LET ME STOP YOU THERE YESTERDAY YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY. THAT WE'VE GOTTEN AN INFLATION PROBLEM AND EVERYBODY WHO'S LISTENING TO THIS AND IT'S NOT LISTENING TO US NO STAT AND ONE THIRD OF THE INFLATION IS. IS DETERMINED BY THE VALUE OF CARS IN THE INSANE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR USED CARS WE'RE IN THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME TO ENCOURAGE POOR PEOPLE OR FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED PEOPLE TO GET INTO ABOUT TO PURCHASE A- USED CAR BECAUSE IT'S AT THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST PRICE IT COULD BE. MY THREE AND A HALF YEAR OLD SUBARU IS WORTH MORE TODAY THAN IT WAS. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN I BOUGHT IT THEN YOU'VE GOT A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO GET A LOT OF. UNSOPHISTICATED ACTUALLY- FINANCIALLY INSECURE PEOPLE TO GO BY ZIPS NOT EXAMS RIGHT NOW AT THE AT THE HIGH POINT FURTHER FUELING INFLATION IN CALIFORNIA HOW COULD THAT BE A STRATEGY I MEAN I GUESS IT MAY BE A GOOD STRATEGY BUT JUNE AND WE VOTED FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION BUT NOW CARBON IS ASKING FOR MORE MONEY ON THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION YOU GUYS ARE ASKING FOR AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. WITH IT WITH INFLATION WE DO HAVE SOME ECONOMIC CANNOT HEAR WHY WOULD YOU HAVE THAT STRATEGY. WHAT WOULD YOU NOT. CHILL OUT ON THIS UNTIL THE PRICE OF USED CARS CAME DOWN IN THE PRICE OF USED CARS IT TOOK. A INSULT TO INJURY THE CARD HAS NOW CHANGED THE CVR PETE SO THE WHOLE BATCH OF MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. HOW DOES THAT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE I GET THE SHINY PENNY I KNOW YOU WANT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA HAVING A SET UP BUT HOW DOES IT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE. TODAY RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES FROM EVERY CALIFORNIAN. JUSTIFIED. MR REGULAR RUSSIAN ARTIST YOU'RE SICK ALL. A DIFFERENT STRUGGLE ARE FIRST AND THE GENERAL BUDGET PRIORITIES HAPPY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PROGRAM STYLE I DON'T KNOW IF THE LEFT WANTS TO JUMP IN. YES SIR I AM PART OF FINANCE YEAH I THINK THE CAN READ THEM PLACE AN ISSUE DEFINITELY IF I'M THE KIND OF WORK MONITORING. I THINK YOU KNOW REGARDLESS WE THINK EITHER STILL SOME. CRITICAL CARE METHODS THAT HELP ACCELERATE OUR TRANSPORTATION INFORMATION GOLD. BALL DRIVING ON EQUITY. AND YET THIS POIGNANT KATHY HOW LONG B. INFLATION ISSUES WILL LAST- BUT THESE ARE OUR MULTI YEAR INVESTMENT THAT WE ARE PROPOSING HERE OVER OVER SEVERAL YEARS. BACK AND HELP THE DRIVE. AND FURTHER SUPPORT LOCAL. COMMUNITIES I'LL BE ABLE TO- ABOARD. OR OR AT LEAST HAVE SOME. ADDITIONAL INVENTIVE BAND AND FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE- COSTS OF- THERE WE SHOULD BE ABLE. WE SHOULD HAVE BREAK IN WE GET IT AND RUN AWAY AND- YOUR- YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT YOU'RE SPURRING INFLATION. AND ADDING WHEN YOU WE HAVE BUDGET OPTIONS WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE MORE MONEY FOR CLEAN CARS FOR ALL OR- OR OR MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAS IS IT WE CAN PUT OTHER- QUALITY. CARBON REDUCTION PROGRAM SO WE HAVE A WE HAVE A WHOLE SUITE OF THEM BUT THIS THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST. COMPONENT THAT FUELS INFLATION YOU GUYS ARE DOUBLING DOWN. THE RESTRICTIONS COMING UP AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. MR RUSSELL TWO THIRDS OF THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE HERE IN THE IN THIS SIX POINT ONE BILLION- BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET IS FOR HEAVY DUTY AND MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TERM INVESTMENT VERSUS A SHORT TERM INVESTMENT WHY FOCUS ON THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY- SECTOR WHAT SPECIFIC OUTCOMES ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING FOR HERE. AND HOW WILL THEY HELP US WITH OUR CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY GOALS AND- BE SPECIFIC PLACE. YEAH I COULD PICK THAT PRECEPTOR CYTOMETRIC CRACK ONCE BECAUSE THE CAR PART OF THAT- ON THEIR PERFECT YOUR SIDE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS EARLY. TO HELP MAKE THE TRANSITION HAPPENED AND IT REALLY IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY I MEAN I HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE'S A REASON WHY A LOT OF ANTI. GLOBAL ARE MAKING A SELECTION VEHICLES ARE OFTEN CHEAPER TO OPERATE LESS MAINTENANCE. LOWER FUEL COSTS WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT IT'S A GOOD FOR OUR BUSINESS IN THE CALIFORNIA. GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S GOOD FOR ECONOMIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. EITHER VEHICLE THAT. GENERALLY RUN ON PEOPLE. REALLY POLLUTING WE KNOW WE TO GET THE UPPER. THEY AHEAD OF TIME AND IT DOES TIME TO BUILD UP. THAT THERE COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM. NINE MONTHS TO YOUR PROJECT GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT. SO WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS TODAY. AND WE HAVE THE PROGRAMS ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED. KEEP HELPING THE POOR THESE BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO DO THAT. PROBABLY IN THE MEETING THAT YOU HAVE THE DESPAIR BUT ALSO VERY TARGETED IN PLACE OF LIKE FRIENDS ABOUT THE- ALTHOUGH IF YOU USE THE TRANSIT THAT THEM. AND ALSO PORT EQUIPMENT BURGER YOU HAVE BEEN WHILE. THAT WE THOUGHT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE MAKING INVESTMENTS THERE. TO BUILD ON THAT. I MEAN WHEN I THINK AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THE PICTURES. JUST ROWS AND ROWS OF COMBUSTION TRUCKS COME IN AND OUT OF AIRPORTS. WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW THE GRAY SKIES IN THE IN THE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHO'S SEEN THE MAPS OF ACCELERATED CANCER RISK. AND ACCOUNT DECLINING AIR QUALITY IMPORTANT FREE COMMUNITIES. THIS IS JUST A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AREA AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ALSO. ALSO. WE'RE HANGING ON THAT WORD IT'S ALSO. WELL I GUESS THE QUESTION IS MR IDEA ARE YOU CAN INVEST IN FIXED RAIL FROM OUR PORTS TO MOVE CARGO TO THE INLAND EMPIRE THE SAN JOAQUIN AND HAVE ZERO EMISSIONS WHY TWO THIRDS OF THIS INVESTMENT GOING IN TO. HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND CREATING WORSE IS NEAR ZERO EMISSIONS YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TRYING TO CREATE THAT TO FOCUS IN ON THE NEAR TERM WE CAN DO THINGS FOR. NEAR TERM EMISSIONS FOR. BIO FUELS TO BE MIXED WITH WITH DIESEL THAT WOULD REDUCE EMISSIONS IN THE SHORT TERM AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY. TOMORROW BUT WE'RE GOING FOR THE SHINY PENNY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHY THESE CHOICES. WE'RE DOING OUR PART OF FINANCE I GET A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF HIGHER AMOUNT YOU THAT WE HAVE ON THE HEAVY DUTY PRIDE THOUGH. I THINK NEAR KNOWLEDGE AT THIS SEGMENT IS IT A LITTLE BIT OF A LESS MATURE SEGMENT THAT DON'T NEED ADDITIONAL OR AT THIS STAGE- AND BIG KNOWLEDGE THIS SEGMENT IS ONE THAT CAUSES SIGNIFICANT LOCAL AIR POLLUTION AND NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. EARLY FOR LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ABELARD INVESTMENT AND THE HEAVY DUTY- AND KIND OF OPERATE. NOW WE CAN CAN DRIVE ECONOMIC OF SCALE L. BROUGHT IN. MY CHANGE- KIND OF WORK FOR COMMON COMPONENTS. TO ENSURE THAT IN THE LONG TERM. WE DO HAVE A MORE EQUITABLE TRANSITION- TO THE REMISSION TECHNOLOGY ENSURE THAT WE DO HAVE THE- NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE WHO- KIND OF. ALIGNED WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE BEATING IT AND- ACTUALLY INVESTMENT IN THAT AREA NOW. WE THINK COULD HELP BUT MORE IN THE LONG TERM GIVEN THAT THIS IS OUT OF THE- VARIOUS. SEGMENTS ONE OF THE- LESS MATURE SEGMENT. INTERMISSION VEHICLE. SO HOW ARE YOU GOOD AT HOW DOES THAT ADDRESS OUR CONGESTION PROBLEMS HENRY I GIVE NO WE'VE BEEN IN A PANDEMIC FOR TWO YEARS AND PEOPLE. ARE IN A HAPPY PLACE BECAUSE THERE'S- A LOT OF FOLKS ARE PEOPLE WORKING REMOTELY BUT WE HAVE. A CONGESTION PROBLEM AND IF ALL YOU'RE DOING IS TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF BUSES BECAUSE YOU'RE DURING COURAGE THEM TO BUY. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WITH REBATES AND INCENTIVES AND TAKE THE TRUCK'S NOT REPLACE ANY TRUCKS BUT MAKE THEM ZERO MISSION. ARE YOU JUST CREATING CLEAN CONGESTION I MEAN IF YOU'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE CONGESTION. YOU'RE SAYING- WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAN. DON'T YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BOTH OF THEM WITH US AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO BOTH OF THEM AND COME UP WITH SOME INCREMENTS OF ELECTRIC TRAINERS SOME WAY TO MOVE CARGO OUT THE PORCH. BEFORE IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE. BUT I SEE. IF YOUR LONG TERM BENEFIT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE IF YOU LOOK AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE YOUR YOUR BIG BAD IS THAT WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO. EIGHT MAGIC SO THAT EVERY HEAVY DUTY TRUCK IS ZERO EMISSION NOT NEAR TERM BUT NEAR ZERO ZERO AND WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY INVESTMENTS INTO FIX RAIL. TO MOVE THEM. YEAH I THINK THE ONE THING I KNOW IS THAT WE DO HAVE OTHER ZERO EMISSION MOBILITY PROGRAMS THAT I THINK THAT- EBOOK AND I'M BACK I DON'T KNOW IF ZOOM DROP ME FROM CLEARLY THAT SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT MR REGULAR FINISHES THOUGHT AND WE'LL COME BACK TO MR SICKLE. IN ORDER TO KNOW ON YOUR- WE DO HAVE- THERE- MISSION MOBILITY PROGRAMS THAT ARE BUILT AND WITHIN THEIR THEIR MISSION PACKAGE- WHICH WHICH DO HAVE HELP WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION OPTION THEY'RE NOT ONLY JUST THE VEHICLES BUT PROVIDE DIFFERENT TYPES OF- KIND OF PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY THAT BEING THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE WHICH I THINK. ARE REALLY GET THAT QUICK QUESTION. THIS IS A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE'LL GET TO GET BACK TO HELP THAT. THAT THIS HOUSE HOW ARE WE- TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PROPOSAL THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BUT MR SCOTT SORRY BUT THE- THE TECHNICALITIES YOU HAD. A NO PROBLEM YOU'RE GOOD IT DIDN'T ME ON. WHY WE HAVE NEW RULES FOR C. V. R. P. AND- THEN WHAT THE BIG THE BIG PLANETS. I WAS GOING TO DO THAT AND I THINK WHERE I WAS WITH A HEAVY DUTY PEACEFUL COMPLEXITY TO IT SOUNDS AND STRAGGLERS COVERED SOME OF THAT STUFF. JUST TO RE EMPHASISE THIS IS REALLY THE MOMENT AND HEAVY DUTY YEAH THERE IS A LOT. NOT ONLY ARE THESE THESE TRUCKS DRIVING BOTH CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE FAILURES AND TOXIC RISK. THEY'RE ALSO AT THIS FASCINATING COST MOMENT IN WHICH BIG INVESTMENTS ARE BEGINNING TO GO INTO THAT SPACE FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND IT IS OUR CHANCE I REALLY THINK TO FOCUS INVESTMENTS IN A LONG TERM AND STRUCTURED WAY GIVEN. THE SPEED AND PACE THAT FLEETS TURNOVER AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WITH CERTAINTY. TO REALLY DRIVE INVESTMENTS. THERE SO FROM MY- I'M THIS PROGRAM. THE CHUCKLE OUT OF BOX. THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO COUNTER CLIMATE CHANGE IN A BIG AND IMPORTANT WAY. AND THEY HELP US FOCUS ON THE EQUITY AIR QUALITY NEEDS WE NEED AND BY INVESTING IN MARCH NOW. THERE IS A CHANCE TO REALLY SUPPORT THAT TRANSITION AT A MOMENT WHEN IT REALLY MATTERS. I'M ON LIGHT DUTY AS I KNOW THAT'S AN AREA OF INTEREST TO. SAY A FEW THINGS ON. THE BOARD AND THE LEGISLATURE BOTH GIVE DIRECTION AND SENIOR PEACE OR IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIONS FROM OUR BOARD IN NOVEMBER. WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON ENSURING THOSE INVESTMENTS SOME FROM THE LAST CYCLE WOULD LAST OVER SEVERAL YEARS WE'LL CONTINUE TO FOCUS THAT PARTICULARLY ON THE LOWER INCOME FOLKS WHO NEEDED THOSE INVESTMENTS MOST. SO IT'S REALLY AN EFFORT TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE PROGRAM ACCORDING TO BOARD GUIDANCE ON AND WE'RE JUST FOCUSED PARTICULARLY IN EQUITIES SO THAT KIND. OF A MULTI MONTH PROCESS THAT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED NOW. I'M IN RESPONSE TO CONTINUED I'M STRONG UPTAKE INDEED WE JUST SAW THE MILLION ON TV SALE SO WE ARE SEEING SOME PROGRESS THERE. AS WELL. WE L. BYE BYE I- HERE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT BIG ORDERS SET ST UP ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FEB ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FIVE MILLION BY TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY WHO'S GOING TO BUY THESE CARS WHO'S GOING TO BUY THESE ELECTRIC VEHICLES I KNOW YOU YOU THINK YOU GOT THE NECK OF THE R. CAR D. DEALERS ARE DOWN ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SELL THEM BUT WHO'S GOING TO BUY THESE CARS IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE THEM WITH INCENTIVES WHEN THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS 90% OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOUGHT ELECTRIC VEHICLES. I READ THE REPORT SAID THAT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS PAID PLAYED A ROLE IF YOU COULD CURLING THEM BACK WHEN WE'VE AGREED WE FINALLY REACH ONE MILLION AND WE GOT THIRTY MILLION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. IN OUR OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS DONE THERE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND THAT YOU GIVE US A THREE YEAR APPROPRIATION AND WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO BOTH LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS MAKE SURE WE KEEP SUPPORTING THIS PROGRESS. AND ANOTHER THING I GUESS I'D SAY. THAT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE OVERALL PACKAGE INCLUDING INVESTMENT STOCK EXTEND THIS TO LOWER INCOME FOLKS I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. WE ARE SEEING COST ON THESE VEHICLES. I'M DOWN WE'RE SEEING HUGE INVESTMENTS AS THE PRESIDENT OBSERVED LAST NIGHT INSTEAD OF THE UNION. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FASTENS TO THE PUNCH REALLY DELAYS BEING MADE TO SOUND I HAVE TO SAY. THERE'S REALLY STRONG DEMAND HERE NOT ONLY IS THE MARKET EXPANDING IN CALIFORNIA AGGRESSIVELY. WERE SEEN BEING PRIVATE COMPANIES EVENT HERE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE BETTER VEHICLES THEY LAST LONGER. THEY'RE CHEAPER TO RUN. AND THEY FIND IT MORE FUN TO DRIVE SO THIS EXCITEMENT HERE. AND A LARGE PART OF THE CONVERSATION NOW I THINK IT'S CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE IN THE US BUT LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS MOVING FORWARD AND CONTINUING. TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THE MARKET THAT'S A FEW PIECES RIGHT. IS BOTH CARDS MAJOR REGULATORY EFFORTS LIKE ADVANCED CLEAN CARS TWO WHICH WILL IMPLEMENT THAT REGULATORY DRIVER. AND THEN THERE KEEP PROGRAMS LIKE THOSE IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION AND ELSEWHERE. THE HELP ENSURE BOTH INCENTIVES AND RATE STRUCTURES MAKE SENSE. AND FINALLY THE ONGOING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDING INVESTMENTS LEGISLATURE INSTRUCTED US O MAKE IN WHICH WE ARE MAKING. THAT INSURE THESE VEHICLES REACH PEOPLE IN COST EFFECTIVE WAYS THAT INCLUDES BOTH MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS. AND FOLKS OF LOWER INCOMES WHO TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED IN WHERE WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS. ON THE EVENTS. AND HOW OFTEN. LAST FROM THE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A- ABOUT A- APPROPRIATELY AS THIS RENTAL. TO I DON'T KNOW WHAT. YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING AT THAT JUST AREN'T THAT MANY ELECTRIC VEHICLES IF YOU HOW CAN YOU SAY IN ONE BREATH THAT PEOPLE LIKE HIM TO RUN BETTER BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THEM YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP YOUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE FOR IT TO BECOME. BECOME USED I WANT TO SELL IT AND YOU'RE CREATING THERE'S SCARCITY IN THE MARKET WITH VEHICLES PER SE I'VE I'VE MADE MY POINT- I GUESS. IT IS THE. IS THE IT'S A PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE SET OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE COULD PURSUE YOU KNOW THE VALLEY- TALKED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS YOU HAVE YOU HAVE. REALLY NOTHING HERE IN THE FARMER PROGRAM NOTHING HERE FOR CARL WARRIOR OTHER YOU KNOW YOU GAVE NOTHING FOR C. P. R. P. I MEAN YOU GUYS CAN ACTUALLY PROPOSING MINISTRATION TO PROPOSE MORE MONEY FOR CVR PETE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE SENATE. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SAY WE WANT TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM MORE EFFECTIVE SO MORE PEOPLE BUY NEW CARS IT'S OKAY. THIS IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO MAXIMIZE THE INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. OR PROVE YOUR QUALITY NOT JUST. HELLO SIR DR APARNA BY AND I THINK WE ALL HAVE BEEN INTO ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WANT TO. ADD ON HERE AS WELL IT DEFINITELY CAN YOU KNOW I THINK WE DEFINITELY DID LOOK ACROSS THE BACK OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS ONCE YOU PRIOR TO THAT THANK YOU FOR KIND OF THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT. STATIONS BY- BOGUS RENTAL INSURER- GOAL IS THE FOCUS ON EQUITY AND HOW BAD BEING ONE OF THE KEY- DRIVING FACTORS AND- CATERPILLARS OF WHAT THIS PACKAGES AND- WHEN LOOKING AT ADD EQUITY I THINK YOU KNOW IT DEFINITELY STILL HAVING- KIND OF OTHER REAL OTHER LANDED. IN HOW FROM THE KIND OF ECONOMY TIED UP BY. WHEN YOU ONLY ON AT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MISS EQUITY AND- LEAVE BEHIND A COMMUNITY. THAT WOULD OTHERWISE. NOT BE ABLE TO- PART OF THE BAY AND ACCORD AND- GET A DIVISION VEHICLE THAT AND BE PART OF THE PROGRAM. AT THE WEEKEND ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS WHERE- YOU KNOW THE STATE COULD STEP IN AT WORK. BASICALLY AND IN THIS AREA AND SO YOU KNOW. WELL WELL THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF OTHER KEY CONSIDERATION THAT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF. THE BIGGEST DRIVING FACTORS- WHICH IS WHICH IS WHY YOU KNOW WE ARE BUILDING AND THE- KIND OF ALLEGATIONS THAT THAT WE ARE I DON'T KNOW YOU GUYS KEEP DRONING ON ABOUT EQUITY EQUITY EQUITY. BUT THE CLEAN MOBILITY OPTIONS COST US ELEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER METRIC TON IN GREENHOUSE GAS. COST EFFECTIVENESS TO YOUR SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROJECT IS FIVE THOUSAND. FIFTY BOOKS YOU GET A JURY DIGESTED THAT WILL INCREASE AIR QUALITY AND IN PARTICULAR- PROVE OUR QUALITY AND CARBON. LIKE LESS THAN A HUNDRED. YOU KNOW THIS CHART HERE DEMO PILOT FOR THE HEAVY DUTY AND OFF ROAD SEPT IS. EIGHTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER METRIC TON. DID IT SOUNDS FRENCH FROM PAGE SEE A- IT'S NOT YOU KNOW WE WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THE PUBLIC. A RETURN ON THEIR IN. NOT PLEASE YOU KNOW THIS IS A FANCY. SHINY PENNY THAT WE WANT TO HAVE I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN NAME IT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO GO. BUT CLEAN MOBILITY OPTIONS- ELEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS I MEAN THEY L. WILLIAMS. GIVES YOU A CHART AND SEE THE CORAL MORE YOUR PROGRAM WHICH GETS POLLUTING FARM EQUIPMENT OFF. IS ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY JUST THE ECONOMIC CITY WE COULD DO THREE TIMES AS MUCH IN THE- GETTING BAD POLLUTING FARM EQUIPMENT OFF THE OFF THE- OUT OF THE SYSTEM. OR KARL MOYER SOME SMALL GENERATORS THEN THIS FANCY SPREADSHEET PROGRAM. DID YOU GUYS TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND I AND I'LL JUST KIND OF KNOW THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE WE DON'T SEE ALL THE PROGRAMS LISTED HERE- FOR EXAMPLE FARMERS ALREADY FIND ARMOR GOT RID GOT MULTI YEAR FUNDING IN LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL I THOUGHT. OTHER PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THAT PART OF THEIR MISSION VEHICLE PACKAGE DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT ALREADY IN THE BUDGET. NO NO I REMEMBER LAST YEAR I WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE BUDGET AND OVER THREE YEARS WHAT I'M ASKING IS YOU GUYS ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON SOME PROGRAMS. AND YOU'RE SAYING WE'VE GOT TO GO WIN BECAUSE IT'S WE'VE HAD SOME SURE RATS WHATEVER YOU DID AND WE WON YES I'M SAYING THAT'S NOT. DEFECTIVE WHY NOT THAT WHY NOT COMING WITH MORE MONEY ON THIS PROGRAM THIS IS A POPULAR PROGRAM THIS REDUCES. OUR CARBON IN THE SHORT TERM. I THOUGHT THAT EXPRESS. NOTHING IN THERE IF YOU GO WHAT EIGHTY THOUSAND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY THREE GESTURES AND WE KNOW METHANE IS KILLING US. ABOARD YOU HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANY PROGRAMS ANY AGGRESSIVE PROGRAMS NOT SIX POINT ONE BILLION. YOU KNOW ONE THING I WIL SPEAK TO ANYONE I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE MINISTRATIONS ALLOCATION DECISIONS THAT'S A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT I WILL SAY THAT SYSTEM CHANGE. REALLY IS CRITICAL HERE SORT OF THINK ABOUT THE METRICS THAT INFORM OUR PROGRAMS THEY'RE MORE THAN JUST STRAIGHT COST EFFECTIVENESS NOW PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY QUITE COST EFFECTIVE. BUT THESE ARE ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT LONG TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGE SO IT'S SPECIAL ANYTHING BUT THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WE'VE INVESTED AS A STATE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CONSTRUCT A SYSTEM THAT IS DEEPLY INEQUITABLE EXPOSES FOLKS TO AND RESOLVE NOT SEVERE POLLUTION. BUILDING OUT OF THAT DOES TAKE TIME BUT OVER THE LONG HAUL THAT IS A BIG AND IMPORTANT CHANGE IT'S NOT JUST COMMUNITIES CALLING FOR IT IT'S THE VISION THAT CALLOUSED AND OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED I THINK LARGELY. BECAUSE OF THAT IN THE LONG TERM HEALTH MOVE US AWAY FROM HAVING TO BUY EVERYONE SINGLE FAMILY OR SINGLE PASSENGER CARS IT'S A BROADER VISION BUT HELP SHIFT THE SYSTEM STATE. SO JUST MULTIPLE METRICS WE NEED TO CONSIDER ALL OF THESE FRONTS THAT I THINK ARE QUITE IMPORTANT TO THINKING ABOUT OUR NEXT YEAR. WOULD YOU CUT YOU WE'VE GONE THROUGH COVERT NOBODY'S ON THE BUSES NOBODY'S ON THE FIXED RAIL WHY DON'T YOU COME UP WITH A PROGRAM THAT WOULD SUBSIDIZE THE A BUS PASS OR TRANSIT PASS IN SACRAMENTO PEOPLE PAYING SEVEN BUCKS A DAY TO RIDE THE BUS IN SACRAMENTO TO SOME LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND- GOVERNMENT WORKERS. COME UP WITH A PROGRAM TO TREAT AT THAT INSTANT INCENTIVIZE THEM OR- GALVANIZE THEM TO RETURN TO THE BUS MAYBE ONE OR TWO DOLLAR TO A FLAT RATE AND SOMETHING THAT YOU SAY THANK YOU MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE GIVE PEOPLE THE DRIVE TESLAS TO GO BACK AND USE TRANSIT. EVEN THINKING ABOUT THAT I THINK THERE IS A METRIC OF POT YOU KNOW IT REALLY GREAT COUNTRIES ARE ONES WHERE THE WEALTHY RIDE TRANSIT AND I AGREE IT IS WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT THOUGH BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIG COMPONENTS OF CLEAN CARS FOR ALL OUR MOBILITY OPTIONS THAT ACTUALLY INCLUDES THINGS LIKE TRANSIT PASSES- IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN ADMINISTRATION LARGER VISION OF TRANSPORTATION SO THERE'S NO NEED. IN THESE PROGRAMS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS AND WE'RE QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THAT ALONG WITH SOME OF THE REGULATORY WORK WE'RE DOING AND HELPING TO ELECT. OR SCIENCE OR SLEEVES WE LOOK FOUR TO SEVENTY. ON THAT FOR A- ALLEY- HIS PRODDED IT SAYS CAN'T USE NEW PROGRAM. AND WE NOT SEEING DETAILS ON THEM- I'VE SAID ENOUGH. CENTER WOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I JUST WITNESSED BUT THAT WAS AWESOME SOMEBODY IS ACTUALLY ASKING FOR SOME DETAIL MEN ASKING FOR A LONG TIME. SO I WANT TO THANK- THE PRESENTERS- SO WE HAVE THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT LOOK WE'RE WE'RE SPENDING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. COUPLED WITH LAST YEAR'S IS THAT INVESTMENT WE'RE GONNA SPEND TEN BILLION THAT DOES THE PROPOSAL IS TEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS. AND IT'S OUT OF SEVERAL POTS- BUT DO YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR CAME UP WITH. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE. NO CELL. OF COMBUSTIBLE ENGINE VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS ON HOW THE INFRASTRUCTURE I WANT I WANTED MAYBE SPRING BOARD OFF OF WHAT THE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE H WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR BECAUSE WERE POPPING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN GRANTS FOR PEOPLE TO DO THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT IS TRYING TO GET US TO AS MY COLLEAGUE QUOTED THE SHINY PENNY AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE. SO TELL ME BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WHAT IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW IS THIS BUDGET. GOING TO GET US. TO WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NO COMBUSTIBLE ENGINES SALES OF VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION. YEAH I CAN SPEAK TO THEM FOR SOCCER SIDE- THAT YOU MENTIONED SO WE HAVE ROBUST TOOLS AND PLANTS THE PLANTS THAT ARE GOOD FOR HER COMPONENT MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO US BY THE LEGISLATURE SO WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH IS A STATE WIDE. OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS WE PROJECT FOR TWENTY THIRTY BEYOND- WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT A. B. TWENTY ONE TWENTY FIVE A REPORT BUT ALSO RECENT LEGISLATION SENATE BILL SIX FORTY THREE AND OUT THERE IN THE PAINTING ON THE HYBRID FIVE WHICH WE ARE GOING TO WANT LATER THAT YEAR WELL. WE ALL HAVE THINGS LIKE THAT DEMOCRAT ACTUALLY PLANNED AND ABOUT THE COMPANY WANTS LOOK- BRICK CORRIDORS YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLANNING AROUND THAT TO ENSURE THAT WE DO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL COMMUNITY AND THE FUNDING WE'RE REQUESTING HERE IN THE MAJOR PORTION OF THAT IT'LL HELP US FUND PROGRAMS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WE ACTUALLY LAUNCHED A ROLE COMMUNITY FAR FROM LAST YEAR I'M HEARING A COLDER. USER AS WELL AND MANY OTHERS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE INVESTMENT THEY'RE. JUST KIND OF A ONE THOUSAND- A VIETNAM FIFTY. WEATHER TEMPERATE. RELATIVE TO THE GEOGRAPHIC LAYOUT OF THE STATE. LOUIS COMMUNITIES NOW POPULATION CENTER. WE ACTUALLY PUT THAT RESEARCH TO WORK- SO CAN YOU WANT TO GO POTENTIAL AND- THE APPLICATION WINDOW CLOSES IN ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO. AND IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE OUR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WILL ALSO BE OVERSUBSCRIBED. THE MONEY RECIVED LAST YEAR AND MONEY WERE OUT BEFORE TODAY. WILL HELP. YOU EVEN MORE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING YOUR- AND CENTER JUST TO BUILD ON THE SUNDAY. SIDE AS THIS RESULTS NOTED RECORDING REALLY CLOSELY AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT BILL THAT'S HAPPENING IN A REALLY THOUGHTFUL WAY MISS BOTH. PUBLIC FUNDS. AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDS FOLKSY THE OPPORTUNITY HERE I MEAN. IT'S A PRETTY HARD TIME SEO IS WITH THE AUTO COMPANIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE FIRMS POURING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THIS DIRECTION THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH THEY RECOGNIZE THIS IS WHERE THE WORLD IS GOING TO WANT TO GET AHEAD OF IT. I THINK SOME OF OUR TASK THE CARD. IS MAKING SURE WE HAVE BOTH THE REGULATORY AND INCENTIVE SCAFFOLDING TO HELP US GET IT. THERE SEEN A LOT OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES AT ONCE SO THAT MEANS BOTH CREATING REALLY CLEAR REGULATORY DIRECTION AND BOTH THE LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY SIDE TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT PICK UP. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE REALLY THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE DURABILITY AND USED VEHICLES. MAKING SURE ALL THESE MARKETS WORK. AND ON THE INCENTIVE SIDE. REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE FOCUSING AND TARGETING THOSE PUBLIC DOLLARS AND SMART WAYS WHICH IS WHY WE FOCUS SO HEAVILY ON EQUITY AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND THINKING THROUGH HOW THIS WORKS FOR THE MANY LIKE UT SECTORS. AND OF COURSE ARE ALWAYS VERY OPEN TO DIRECTION WAYS TO DO THAT BETTER I THINK IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING. WELL YOU DIDN'T NEITHER OF YOU ANSWERED MY QUESTION THE QUESTION BECAUSE THE GUY YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOUR GIVING OUT TO. IN GRANTS AND. DOING STUDIES ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO. DISADVANTAGED AND ALL THAT. ACTUALLY TELL ME HOW WE'RE GOING TO. ELECTRIFY THIRTY MILLION CARS. IN CALIFORNIA WE WOULD JUST LAST YEAR I MEAN THIS IS JUST INSANE LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR ASKED US NOT TO CHARGE OUR CARS DURING THE P. S. P. WHEN WE HAD WHEN WE HAD WIND ADVANCE WE HAVE IT AND THAT THIS IS THE ELECTRIC GENERATION SIDE OF OUR STATE. NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT. SIXTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS LAST YEAR. WERE WE DIDN'T GENERATE POWER BECAUSE WE HAVE P. S. P. S. IS. NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT WERE IT BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. WE'RE GONNA HAVE ELECTRIC GRID SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE TO PUT ALL THESE. VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA THE REAL CHARGE OF. WE HAVE NO CHARGING STATIONS WE HAVE NO GENERATION I'M TALKING ABOUT JURORS WORK WE'RE GONNA SHUT DOWN. THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS AT DIABLO CANYON. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HOW YOU CAN REPLACE THAT. WE DON'T COUNT LARGE HYDRO THESE THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS I WANT TO KNOW WE LOOK I WILL I'M IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS. AND CARB UNDER AB THIRTY TWO FORCED ME TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE TECHNOLOGY IN MY TRUCKS AND IT COST ME A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY AND BY THE WAY THE TECHNOLOGY DIDN'T WORK. THE TRUCKS BROKE DOWN CAUGHT ON FIRE ALL KINDS OF THINGS. YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE BY TWENTY THREE BY THERE'S NO DETAIL IN HERE OF HOW THE PLAN GOES AND HOW WE'RE- GONNA REDUCE CARBON. CALIFORNIA ADMITS 1% OF THE WORLD'S CARBON YOU'RE TELL ME THAT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO. WILL IT GET INTO THE QUESTION HOW'S THAT GENERATING ELECTRICITY CALIFORNIA GONNA COME IF YOU'RE GONNA SHUT DOWN DIABLO CANYON AND IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS. AND WHERE'S ALL THIS ENERGY GONNA COME FROM. HOW'S IT GOING TO HAPPEN HOW WE GONNA CHARGE THESE CARS AND PUT IN THESE FIVE THOUSAND DC FAST CHARGERS. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE I'M ACTUALLY VERY GLAD YOU ASKED THAT. SO I WANT TO START BY NOTING THAT DIDN'T LIKE PS YEAH THANK. YOU YOU ARE A FUNCTION OF. WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DONE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT. WILDFIRES AND DROUGHT ENDED THE INACTION. OF NOT DEALING WITH. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT HAVE BANDAID SOLUTION TO REALLY CONNECT. TO THE REMOTE COMPUTER. LET ME ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT REGRET IN. RESILIENCY AND LIVE ARE TO OUR MISSION. AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PROACTIVE WORK IN THIS SPACE- I THINK FRANKLY WE COULD D A BETTER JOB OF EDUCATING FOLKS OF ALL WE ARE DOING IN THE STATE HAS ADVANCED ELECTRIC THE COMPLAINING CONSTANTLY. DEMAND FORECASTING CAPABILITIES. ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS HEATING ELECTRIC VEHICLE. AND WE- WE HAVE MULTI AGENCY COLLABORATION OF ENERGY COMMISSION AND- THE NETWORK OUT. THE TYPE OF TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS. THE BEAUTY INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING. AND WE CONTINUE TO ADD MORE CAPACITY TO THE GRID. WE CANNOT LET THE GRAND BE A BARRIER TO OUR ADOPTION. WE'VE GOT A TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF THE STATIONERY STORES IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE. AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD EVEN MORE ENERGY. FOR A COPY CAN GENERATION. SO AS WE LOOK AT UP GRIP ALL THE NEED TO BE CROSS ABOUT IT ACROSS. EIGHTY P. AND UTILITIES WE ALSO LOOK AT THE LOAD THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO COLLECTOR VEHICLES AS WELL. WE HAVE TO MAKE THE BY TWENTY THIRTY WILL HAVE BETWEEN 12221% NEW LOW COMPARED TO TODAY. AND THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM WIDE PEAK I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE INVESTMENT WE NEED TO BE MAKING OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL FOR DISTRIBUTION P. WE'RE PLANNING POLITICALLY BOTH THE- MODEL. AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WELL. BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW MORE LIKE A VEHICLE OR QUITE REMARKABLE. THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE ON SITE RESILIENCY IN A WAY THAT I GOTTA FEEL COOL COULD NEVER GET THIS IS NOT SOME FAR FETCHED THING WE'RE GONNA DO IN THE FUTURE THIS IS- WHAT THE FORD F. ONE FIFTY LIGHTING. WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT RECALLED LAUGHTER I THINK YOU HAVE ONE ORDER- I DO TOO SO WE ALL HAVE THAT ONE RELATIVELY SOON. AND THEN THAT'S NOT THE ONLY VEHICLE DOING IT YOU KNOW JUST A BIT DEEPER BALL THERE WAS A CUTE BABY SEX. SHOULD BUY TO REPLICATE THE BUILDING AS WELL EITHER WE'RE PLANNING FOR TODAY THE TECHNOLOGY HERE. WE DID NOT HAVE THE WILL TO CONNECT ABOUT. S. DRIVER PART OF MY BILL THING ALL JUST KNOW IS AGENDA I NUMBER THREE ACTUALLY ON THE- GREEN ENERGY IN. AT THE BUILDING IT IS BENEFITS WHICH I THINK WILL BE A TO DO IT OUT THERE AND DETAIL. THE NECK AGENDA. WHICH I THINK PARTIALLY GET YOUR QUESTION ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING. IN TERMS OF THAT KIND OF BROADER ENERGY PORTFOLIO. AND THAT THEY'LL BE THE NEXT DAY THAT. WELL OKAY I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE POWER AND I THIS IS A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE JUST HANDING OVER AND THERE'S NO DETAILS IS BASICALLY YOU KNOW YOU'RE SAYING GIVE US THE MONEY AND WE'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND IT OR WHAT WE'RE BUYING LATER AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME WHEN WE'RE PAYING. IN A RANGE FROM. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO A THOUSAND TO SIX TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TIME. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES IN THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE- WITH THAT PUT THE BULLET TRAIN. THE ACTUAL REDUCTION IN CARBON THAT THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE IS WHEN WE CAN GET INTO AN ESTIMATE OF THE THOUSANDS PART TIME IF IT EVEN DOES IT. SO FOR ME IT'S LIKE WE NEED A LOT MORE. DETAIL ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE AND I THINK THE PUBLIC IS STARTING TO DEMAND IT BECAUSE- LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PORTS IN THE DRY TRUCKS FOR A- FOR A MOMENT. LAST NIGHT I WAS MAYBE TWO WEEKS AGO WE HAD THE PORT AUTHORITY PERSON THERE'S ONE THERE'S ONE VEHICLE AVAILABLE AND WE I ASKED ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GONNA HAVE TO COME INTO THE PORTS. AND ALL I HEARD WAS ABOUT WE REALLY GOT TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS FOR. OUR PORTS. SO I DID SOME RESEARCH. THE REASON WE HAVE AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS IN IN THE PORTS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE. SUPER TANKERS SITTING OUT THERE IDOLING WAITING TO UNLOAD OIL COMING FROM ECUADOR. SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A BIT WE DON'T HAVE THE BILL WHICH HAVE NO. NO REGULATIONS LIKE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THEY'RE SITTING OUT EARLY IF IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU. CHANGE THE PORT AT ALL IT'S THE SHIPS THAT ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING. THE POLLUTION THAT IS POLLUTING SAN DIEGO THERE WAS AN NBC STORY ABOUT IT. BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HOW WE COULD PRODUCE. CLEAN FUEL GASOLINE OUT OF CALIFORNIA AND I ASKED LAST WEEK ABOUT THIS SIX HUNDRED WELLS VETERAN PERMITTING PROCESS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PERMITTED BECAUSE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THE JOB DONE FOR THESE OIL PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH THEY PRODUCE THE MOST. CLEAN ENERGY IN THE WORLD. AND WE'RE WE'RE WATCHING. NOW ECUADOR SENDING. 27% OF OUR OIL IN HERE AND THEY'RE DESTROYING THE RAINFOREST SO HOW CAN CALIFORNIANS FEEL GOOD ABOUT ABOUT IT WE'RE GONNA LEAD THE WORLD IN CLEAN TECHNOLOGY BUT WE DON'T USE OUR OWN TECHNOLOGY HERE WORK FOR FORCING US TO BRING OILS. AND OTHER PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN AND THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM. TO ME IS A IS THIS A PROCTOR SEE THE THINK THAT. WE'RE GOING TO LEAD THE WORLD BUT WE DON'T TELLTHE TRUTH THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WHERE EXPERT BRINGING EXPORTS IN HERE AND WE'RE NOT DEVELOPING OUR OWN RESOURCES IN A CLEAN. AND EFFICIENT MANNER AND ACTUALLY GETTING TALIB CALIFORNIA'S TAX BASE AND JOBS HERE. SO FOR SO- SOMEHOW SOMEBODY HAS TO. EXPLAIN TO ME HOW WE'RE GONNA DRIVE THE COST ON THE LAST THING I'LL POINT OUT WHICH I POINT OUT EVERY SINGLE TIME. IS WE TALK ABOUT WILDFIRE WILDFIRE. WHICH IS THE IT WHICH WE NEED TO BE SPENDING WE NEED TO SPEND ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLARS ON WILDFIRE IS THAT A TEN BILLION DOLLARS ON. GETTING PEOPLE IN EV'S. BECAUSE WE'RE BURNING DOWN OUR OUR IT- FORCED A MILLION ACRES BURNED IN MY DISTRICT LAST YEAR AND WE'RE NOT SPENDING THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO SPEND THERE AND IT DEVASTATES A WILDLIFE THE WATERSHEDS THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS NEED AND IT'S A PLACE WHERE WE SEQUESTER CARBON WHERE THIS MONEY'S GOING WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS IN A COMMON SENSE APPROACH WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF A WILDFIRE SO WE DON'T HAVE THE P. S. P. S. IS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. WE NEED A SICK MAKE OUR- OUR WATERSHEDS HEALTHY. AND THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING THE MONEY AND IT'S THE CHEAPEST PLACE WE CAN REDUCE CARBON. EXCELLENT AND I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION ON THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PACKAGE THAT'S- BEFORE US ON THE- BETWEEN THE AIRPORT AND THE C. E. C. HOW ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO ADMINISTER THE FEDERAL FUNDS. THAT ARE COMING THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE HOW DOES THAT. SOUND ON THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURES CODE TO CARVE DIFFICULT THAT THAT AND OBVIOUSLY HOW. YOU GUYS TOUCHED ON THE KAUFMAN I REMEMBER IN THE FALL THE AIRPORT WAS GOING THROUGH SOME REGULATIONS. YES SOME REGULATIONS ON THE ACTUAL MACHINES AND THEY WERE DEBATING WHETHER THEY WOULD SWIPE YOUR CREDIT CARD OR YOU HAVE TOUCHLESS. THERE'S A QUITE A ACRIMONY THAT HOW DID THAT. END UP BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE ARE CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO HAVE. THE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY- AND IT SEEMS SILLY TO ME BUT. MAYBE MISTER SIEGEL HOW YOU COULD. IN ME SURE- SINISTER SPEAKING FEDERAL FUNDS AS ACTS WITH YOUR CARD ASKED TO THE AXIS REGULATION THAT COMES FROM A STATUTE THE LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO INSURE OPEN ACCESS TO CHARGING THAT WE SEE REALLY IMPORTANT- WE HAD SOME COMPANIES- SUGGESTS THAT. SOME ASPECTS OF THAT REGULATION THAT ENSURE FOLKS WITH CHIP CARDS IS NOT EVERYONE IS A TAP CARD I'M IN CHARGE- WILL BECOMING OUTDATED. WE DID A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IS NOW OUT OF THE DRAFT REPORT WHICH BASICALLY SHOWS THAT ALTHOUGH THOSE TAP CARDS ARE BECOMING MORE PREVALENT. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE THEM THAT WILL BE REPORTING TO THE BOARD AND THAT WE CAN COMMENT ON THE DRAFT I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW- LATER. IN THE SPRING AND THEN THE BOARD CAN CHOOSE WHERE IT WANTS TO GO FROM THERE. I UNDERSTAND FROM THE BANKS THAT ANYBODY CAN GET A CARD WHEN I WAS SENT WHEN I WAS A COP TWENTY SIX. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A SWIPE MACHINE EVERYTHING WAS TAPPED EVERYTHING WAS GOOD IN SCOTLAND- AND ALL THAT IT IS GREAT BRITAIN BUT THIS GOT THAT. GENTLEMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT ON THIS ONE IT'S A OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR EYE ON AND WE'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS AND- WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. DURING THE BUDGET DISCUSSION SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WILL HOLD THAT MATTER OPEN AND HE SAID THE CLEAN ENERGY. INVESTMENTS- AND I THINK I HAVE EDUCATION GOOD MORNING IF IT'S STILL MORNING MORNING IT WOULD BE- GOING SHARE- SENATOR DOLLY MY NAME IS DREW BOWING I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND- KEVIN WILL BE TESTIFYING ON A NUMBER OF MATTERS BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING SOMEBODY MOVED VERY QUICKLY. WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO AT THE LA- REPORT NOTED CALIFORNIAN TWENTY TWENTY WAS POWERED BY CLEAN ENERGY- JUST SHY OF 60% OF OUR ENERGY WAS FROM CLEAN ENERGY FOR ALL RETAIL SALES 36% OF THAT WAS FROM RENEWABLES. IN ADDITION THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO REACHING THE SP THIRTY TWO GOAL OF 40% GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BY NINETEEN NINETY BY TWENTY THIRTY- BETTER BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY- A COUPLE YEARS AGO SO WELL OVER A DECADE IN ADVANCE SO I THINK THESE ARE THINGS TO BE PROUD OF. ON THE OTHER HAND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOUR REFLECTS THE MASSIVE. AMOUNT OF WORK STILL LEFT TO BE DONE. THE SCALE OF THE SHELL AND THEN. IN JUST ABOUT THIS WHEN YEAR WE PUBLISHED THE SB ONE HUNDRED FOUR AND IT MADE A COUPLE OF REALLY KEY FINDINGS FIRST BUT I KNOW IT IS A 100% CLEAN EIGHT A FIVE IS ACHIEVABLE SH BUT WE'LL NEED TO APPROXIMATELY TRIPLE OUR ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM SOLAR AND WIND. AND WILL NEED TO INCREASE BATTERY STORAGE RATES BY MUCH MORE THAN THAT. SO THIS PACKAGE BEFORE YOU PROPOSE TO INVEST TO BUILD TWO BILLION DOLLARS ACROSS SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS A FEW OF. WHICH YOU'LL HEAR FROM US A LITTLE BIT LATER THIS MORNING WE- ARE THE ENERGY COMMISSION WOULD MANAGE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION OF THAT. RESIDENTS DESIGN TO DO A FEW THINGS FIRST MAINTAIN A LASER FOCUS ON THE LIABILITY I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE LAST PANEL. ABOUT THE NEEDTO BE VIGILANT ABOUT RELIABILITY THAT'S JOB NUMBER ONE. SECOND SPUR PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAN GENERATE JOBS. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO LEVERAGE LEVERAGE SOME OF THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING TO CALIFORNIA OR COULD BE IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL ITH THE COMPETITIVE GRANTS. AND WE WANT TO PROMOTE EQUITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING IN TRIBAL LOW INCOME AND UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. THIS PROGRAM- THIS THIS PACKAGE WAS DEVELOPED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER AGENCIES. AND WE THINK IT REPRESENTS REALLY STRONG BOTH SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER THERE'S A NEED RIGHT NOW TO START REDUCING POLLUTION AND ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND THEN. ALSO THE LONGER TERM. THE PUBLIC THAT THE PRIOR- HANDLED LOOK AT TRANSPORTATION DECARBONIZATION I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU BRIEFLY- TODAY ABOUT HOW WE'VE WE POCKETED THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN THREE AREAS PURCHASE OR CHRISSY GENERATION CARBONIZATION. THE SECOND IS BUILDING THE CARBONIZATION AND THE THIRD IS INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION. YEAH LOTS TO COVER SOME OF MOVE REALLY QUICKLY FIRST. PROPOSING FOR ELEMENTS OF ELECTRICITY SYSTEM THE CARBONIZATION I'LL TAKE THOSE BRIEFLY WONDERED THE FIRST. LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE AND WERE SEEKING TREATMENT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS. REALLY KEY TO OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. IT WILL HELP US ENSURE RELY RESILIENT LECTURER WHEN THE NUMBERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE- CENTER DOLLY SHE POINTED OUT WELL WHEN THE GRID IS DOWN FOR FURTHER RESEARCH. THREE PRIMARY DRIVERS FOR THIS PROPOSAL THE FIRST AS WE HAVE DONE REALLY WELL WITH- LITHIUM TECHNOLOGY EVERYBODY OWNS THE SHOP ONE OR MORE. OUR NEXT HOUR BY LITHIUM. BUT IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED FOR THE GRID SCALE- STORAGE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE INTO THE FUTURE SO WE WANT TO INVEST IN A DIVERSIFICATION. PROGRAM AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OTHER CHEMISTRIES LIKE SAY IRON FLOW BATTERIES MECHANICAL STORAGE LIKE COMPRESSED AIR AND FLY WHEELS ANDTHERMAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT'S ONE REASON BEHIND SECOND IS. TO HELP COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE GRID OUTAGES AGAIN CENTERED ALL YOU KNOW TO THIS EARLIER- THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER PS PS A MENTION OF THE PAST TWO SUMMERS. BY THE OUTAGES SOME OF WHICH HAVE EXCEEDED FOUR HOURS AND FOUR HOURS IS GENERALLY THE BENCHMARK OF WHERE LITHIUM WORKS VERY EFFECTIVELY BEYOND THAT IT'S NOT THE BEST CHEMISTRY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF. TODAY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON THAT AND GET- STORAGE THAT LASTS LONGER AND THEN FINALLY A GREAT SUPPORT THE ISSUE IN A REPORT INDICATES WE NEED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF ADDITIONAL STORAGE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND WE GOT TO BRING THE COST DOWN TO GET THE PERFORMANCE BETTER IN THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS INVESTMENT WILL DO ARE BASICALLY SPELLS OUT THE PLAN AND A LOT MORE DETAIL- BUT I'M GONNA LEAVE IT AT THAT AND INVITE QUESTIONS AT. THE END. NEXT TO THE GREEN HYDROGEN. TREMENDOUS PROM IN HIDE YOUR- YOU'VE HEARD OF IT'S IMPACTS INCREASE. IT'S ALSO. VERY HELPFUL AND HARD TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS LIKE INDUSTRY THAT REQUIRES VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES. AND THEN FINALLY A GREAT SUPPORT IT I USUALLY CAN COMPLEMENT. OR REPLACE THE FOSSIL GASBURN THAT WE SEE TODAY. AND IT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR STORAGE I DIDN'T TO BE SHORT FOR A LONG TIME THEN USE LATER. HOWEVER WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT. IT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A NEWCOMER TO THIS CLEAN ENERGY SPACE. WHAT WE PROPOSE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A NO REGRETS STRATEGIES. THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA USE HYDROGEN YOU GOTTA PRODUCE IT YOU CAN'T PUT A WINDOW YOU CAN PUT UP A SOLAR PANEL YOU GOTTA PRODUCE IT USING ELECTRICITY FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SOURCES ARE GOING. AND WHAT WE WOULD PROPOSE TO DO IS USE- BUT LOOK AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS. DIFFERENT SKILLS THAT WE CAN USE ELECTROLYSIS SPLITTING THE HYDROGEN OUT OF H. TWO O. WATER TO- SECURE THAT HYDROGEN WILL BE USED FOR THE PURPOSES WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. SO RIGHT NOW ABOUT 95% OF ALL I DID IN THIS USED COMES FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND WE WANT TO REVERSE THAT TREND. WE APPRECIATE AND NOBODY QUESTIONS ON THIS THAT THERE IS FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THIS AND WE THINK WE ARE. OBJECTIVELY POSITION TO. RECEIVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THAT FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. AND HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER AS WELL. NEXT UP THE THIRD OF THE FOUR AND ELECTRICITY DECARBONISATION IS OSCAR WIN. CALIFORNIA HAS AN ENORMOUS UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT SURE WHEN. IT'S NICE BECAUSE IT COMPLEMENTS SOLAR WIND OFTEN BLOWS WHEN THE SUN ISN'T SHINING. CENTRAL IS THIS VERY LARGE COASTAL ECONOMIES CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS PARTICULAR UP ON THE NORTH COAST AND IN THE CENTRAL COAST. AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE GOALS THAT- BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS LAID OUT- LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR THIRTY GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND BY TWENTY THIRTY NATIONWIDE FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OFFSHORE WIND. AND WE WOULD USE THIS FUNDING FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR EARLY STAGE PLANNING. AND FOR SOME INITIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED. FINALLY- FIRST SECTOR IS ENERGY MODELING THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENTS SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO SHIFT OUR CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. SHE SHE LED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SP ONE HUNDRED REPORT AND WE LOOK IT UP A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. SHOP THE CARD WITH A CORE SCENARIO THAT COMBINED INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EFFORTS WE LOOK AT THIS VERY DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WITH DIFFERENT- COMBINATIONS OF RESOURCES. AND MODELING WAS CRITICAL TO THE SPOUSES. INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE A SMALL INVESTMENT IN MODELING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE WISE DECISIONS THROUGHOUT. EACH ALL RIGHT NEXT UP IS BUILDING DECARBONIZATION WE'RE SEEKING NINE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR BUILDING DECARBONIZATION AND WE'RE CALLING THE EQUITABLE BUILDING THE CAR BECAUSE- THAT'S REALLY WHAT OUR FOCUS IS. WE'VE DONE REALLY REALLY WELL IN CALIFORNIA NEW BUILDINGS WE HAVE AMONG THE CLEANEST- CLOSEST TO ZERO CARBON APPROACHING. ZERO CARBON BUILDINGS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. BUT HE HAS BEEN BUILDING LEVEL OF WORK TO DO. AROUND HALF OF ALL BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA WERE BUILT BEFORE THE ENERGY COMMISSION STARTED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. CREATING RULES ABOUT- ABOUT BUILDINGS AND HOW THEY CAN BE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TARGETING WITH THIS FUNDING IS AN EXISTING BUILDING STOCK. THE PROPOSALS AIMED AT THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US AND WE'RE LOOKING AT DIRECT INSTALLS. IN REBATES DIRECT INSTALLS IN PARTICULAR WE THINK WILL WORK WELL IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND MIDDLE INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THE REBATES WOULD BE TARGETED AT ALL CALIFORNIA COACH- I THINK I'M GONNA SKIP A LITTLE HERE IN MY NOTES TO MOVE ALONG BUT AGAIN HAPPY TO ASK QUESTIONS OR ANSWER QUESTIONS WERE LOOKING TO- DO WORKSHOPS ON ALL THESE TOPICS. AND REALLY REFINE FOR PRECISION WHAT WE WOULD BE- STYLING THE PROGRAM STATUS. SO FINALLY I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION WHERE WERE SEEKING FUNDING FOR TWO PROGRAMS. THE FIRST IS THE FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENT PROGRAM I THINK YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS WE WATCHED IT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH FUNDING FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMON INVESTMENT. PROGRAM AND IT WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL WE RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR FUNDING THAT WERE TWICE AS MUCH AS THE FUNDING WE HAVE AVAILABLE THERE WERE MANY UNSUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS. WHO HAD MERITORIOUS PROJECTS BUT WE HAD TO PICK THE BEST OF THE BEST AND SOME DIDN'T MAKE IT. SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE SHOWING 7280% ENERGY SAVINGS SO THIS IS BEEN A DEMONSTRABLY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM ONE THAT WILL YIELD IMMEDIATE RESULTS. ARE RELATIVELY IMMEDIATE RESULTS WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO GET GRASS OUT THERE. ABOUT 85% OF THE SITE TO THE CURRENT FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENT PROGRAM CALLED AFTER WE'RE IN DISADVANTAGED OR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WE AIM TO DO- THE SAME WITH THE- WITH THE NEW FUNDING TARGET. THOSE COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED. CARBS ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF PRO PLAY THIS ONE VERY HIGH. SO IT WAS IT WAS- DEFECTIVE AS A MATTER OF GETTING FUNDS OUT AREAS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF- OKAY SO ON THE SORT OF THING AND IT WAS EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE AS WELL. FINALLY WE ARE SEEKING TO EMULATE THE SUCCESS WE'VE HAD WITH THE FOOD PRODUCER WITH WITH THE WITH THE F. TYPE PROGRAM. WITH A BROADER INDUSTRIAL THE CARD SO WE WANT TO TAKE THE LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM THE ACTIVE PROGRAM IN APPLIED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES CALIFORNIA HAS- IS THE BEST STAFF REPORT NOTED. FORTY THOUSAND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES EMPLOYING ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIA'S. SECOND THE SECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER USE IN MORE THAN 20% OF OUR STATE'S CHICHI EMISSIONS. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY THAT THE TOP INDUSTRIAL GHG EMITTERS NOT INCLUDING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION WE'RE LOOKING AT- CEMENT CHEMICALS GLASS AND THOSE. THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF INDUSTRIES- WE'RE LOOKING AT ELECTRIFICATION. STORED WHERE IT MAKES SENSE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND A WHOLE SUITE OF TOOLS THAT WE THINK WILL. HELP INDUSTRY. AGAIN WE'LL BUILD MORE WE LEARNED ON F. TIPPED AND- BUT BUILT SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN THE INDUSTRIAL D. KERR PROGRAM WHICH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU THIS MORNING AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YEAH. MR MENON AT THE AIRPORT. I THINK THAT. PART WAS GOOD RESTAURANTS MY MISSING SOMEBODY SCREWED BEFORE IS OR SOMETHING WITH THE AIRPORT ARE YOU. I WAS ON. THERE'S I THINK THERE'S SOMEBODY FROM THE WATER BOARD THAT GOES BEFORE ME AFTER DREW I THINK IT'S TEN CRACK. OUR YES HI GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR- WHAT I WONDER AT PRESENT TODAY AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PACKAGES AN OVERVIEW OF A SPECIFIC. ENERGY STORAGE PROJECT THAT'S INCLUDED WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION TO RESTORE ON STORAGE OPERATIONS AT THE LAKE ORVILLE COMPLEX- THIS IS- IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH PUMPED STORAGE THIS WOULD BE A PROPOSAL TO. TURN A LAKE OR A BILL INTO A VERY LARGE BATTERY TO SUPPORT THE ELECTRIC GRAD WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO GENERATE UP TO NINE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY OUT OF THE LAKE ORVILLE COMPLEX WHICH IS BASICALLY A COMPARABLE TO THE POWER NEEDED TO PROVIDE- A CITY THE SIZE OF SAN FRANCISCO JUST TO GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE- THE SCALE. SO THAT PUMPED STORAGE IS A PROCESS THAT IN THIS CASE WOULD BE UTILIZED- EXCESS SOLAR GENERATION THAT'S AVAILABLE DURING THE DAY TO PUMP. WATER INTO LAKE LAURA BELL. AND THEN- GENERATE POWER OUT A LAKE OR A BILL RELEASED OUT WATER DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING- TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY SO REALLY ACT AS A LARGE BATTERY- TO TAKE SOLAR ENERGY DURING THE DAY AND THEN- RELEASE IT TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY AT TIMES OF THE DAY ONE WHEN POWER IS NEEDED. TO SUPPORT THE ELECTRIC GRID- ONE OTHER THING THAT MAKES THIS PROJECT VERY ATTRACTIVE IS THAT. MUCH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY IN PLACE SO THIS PROJECT CAN BE DONE AT A FRACTION OF THE COST OF THE COMPARABLE. ENERGY STORAGE PROJECT OF THIS SIZE AND IN A TIME OF ABOUT TO CAP THE AMOUNT OF TIME IS IT A TYPICAL. A PROJECT OF THIS AND SO OVERALL THIS IS A PROJECT AT ALL- YOU KNOW REALLY SUPPORT THE STATE'S ELECTRIC GRID- AT A- BETTER. CARE COSTS AND ALSO IN A SHORTER TIME THAN AND THEN ON THE OTHER PROJECTS. AND SO MAYBE AT THIS POINT ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THEIR BOARD. AND MR- IT'S GIVEN TO COVER THE NEXT ELEMENT OF THE PACKAGE AND I'LL JUST SAID THAT WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION MOVE THAT PROJECT FROM THE DROUGHT PACKAGE THROUGH THE CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENT BUT- LET'S HEAR FROM THE AIRPORT. YEAH THANKS TED ANDREW. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HI MY NAME IS MIKE THAT'S GIVEN. YEAH I'M WITH. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD'S RESEARCH DIVISION- HYDRO FLUOROCARBONS OR AGENCIES ARE THE FASTEST GROWING GREENHOUSE GASES IN CALIFORNIA AND GLOBALLY. THESE AGENCIES ARE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WITH HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL. THOUSAND TIMES THAT OF CARBON DIOXIDE. AND THEY HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE ADVERSE CLIMATE IMPACT IN THE NEAR TERM. SO ONE OF THE LARGEST USES OF HSCS IS IN REFRIGERATION. AND AIR CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT- CARBERY EARLY ON NEED TO REGULATE THESE GASES AND MANY OTHER STATES HAVE FOLLOWED HER LEAD IN ADOPTING SIMILAR RULES TO MITIGATE THESE POLLUTANTS. INCENTIVE FUNDING WILL HELP US MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS AND START TO ADDRESS AGENCIES UNDER CARBON NEUTRALITY- THIS PROPOSAL ASKED FOR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING. TO BUILD UPON THE ONE MILLION ALLOCATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. WHICH WAS FOCUSED FOCUSED ON COMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS COMMONLY USED IN SUPERMARKETS AND GROCERY STORES. ULTRA LOW GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TODAY HOWEVER A HIGHER INCREMENTAL COST AND LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. I MERRY BARRIERS TO THEIR ADOPTION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR EXISTING STORES BECAUSE IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND CHALLENGING TO TRANSITION TO AN ULTRA LOW GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL SYSTEM DUE TO INCOMPATIBILITY IS BETWEEN THE OLD AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF INCENTIVE FUNDS EXISTING STORES ARE LIKELY TO EITHER CONTINUE TO LOOT USE THEIR LEGACY SYSTEMS. OR DO A REFRIGERANT RETROFIT TO- MIDRANGE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL REFRIGERANT RATHER THAN INSTALLING A NEW SYSTEM. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CARD AWARDED FIFTEEN GRANTS TO SUPERMARKETS TO IMPLEMENT STATE OF THE ART CLIMATE FRIENDLY REFRIGERATION TECHNOLOGIES. THAT REDUCE THE CLIMATE IMPACT OF CONVENTIONAL HFC REFRIGERANTS BY. 99% THE PROGRAM IS 22% OVERSUBSCRIBED AND HAPPY AWARDS ONE STORES LOCATED IN LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER THIS REPRESENTS LESS THAN 1% OF ALL SUPERMARKETS IN CALIFORNIA AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ARE NEEDED TO HELP TRANSITION THOUSANDS OF EXISTING HFC SYSTEMS IN THE STATE AND WOULD BE CRUCIAL IN HELPING SMALLER STORES IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BESIDES SUPERMARKETS WE WOULD CONSIDER INCENTIVES FOR OTHER COMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION CATEGORIES AS WELL AS AIR CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT. SO DEPENDING ON THE SELECTED AND USES THIS FUNDING CAN REPLACE EXISTING HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL REFRIGERANT SYSTEMS AND ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND STORES. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS FUNDING IS EXPECTED TO HELP THESE TECHNOLOGY TYPES RICHARD CONNER IS A SCALE WHICH WILL LEAD TO FURTHER MARKET ADOPTION. AND THEREFORE GREATER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. SO THANK YOU- THAT WRAPS UP THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRESENTATION ON THAT ENERGY PACKAGE AND OF COURSE WE WOULD ALL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR VERY GOOD WILL. PRECEDE THE FOLLOW THROUGH FROM. LAST YEAR'S SENT MR BROWN YOUR COMMENTS FROM THE ALIEN'S PERSPECTIVE FOR GO TO. OF MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MR SHEARER- SIMILAR TO THE PACKAGE WE RELEASED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED CLEAN ENERGY PACKAGE LAST WEEK AND SO THAT'S ALSO POSTED OUR WEBSITE ON YOUR AGENDA INCLUDES A LOT OF OUR COMMENTS SO AGAIN I'M GONNA TRY TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE- A FEW COMMENTS FROM THAT- FROM THAT ANALYSIS. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO I'M GONNA DIVIDE MY COMMENTS INTO. TWO DIFFERENT PARTS ONE WITH JUST SOME OVERARCHING COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE AS A WHOLE AND SOME CONSIDERATIONS AND THEN I'LL GET INTO. A FEW OF OUR SPECIFIC COMMENTS OR RECOMMENDATIONS ON A FEW SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE PROPOSAL SO FIRST. ON THE OVER ARCHING COMMENTS- WE THINK THE PACKAGE GENERALLY TARGETS A REASONABLE SET OF ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE DEEP DECARBONIZATION SO IF YOUR GOAL IS KIND OF. LONG TERM DEEP DECARBONIZATION A PARTICULAR BILL ACTRESS DEGRADED AND EVEN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAN WE THINK. IN A FUNNY MOOD SUPPORT KEY AREAS WHERE SUBSTANTIAL. PROGRESS COULD HELP THE COST OF ACHIEVING THOSE THE VERY LONG TERM GOALS AND SO- BUT ALSO IN ALL THE OTHER LARGEST PIECES OF FUNDING RELATED TO BUILDING DECARBONIZATION TARGETS ONE OF THE- LARGEST SOURCES OF STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT. CHALLENGES TO KIND OF DECARBONISATION. S. KIND OF BIG PICTURE COM I THINK IT- WE DO OUR- STATE GENERAL RATHER THAN RATEPAYER FUNDS ELECTRIC REPAIR FUNDS IN PARTICULAR DOES HAVE MERIT- AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW MANY OF THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN PAID FOR BY- I'LL YOU RATE- THROUGH HIGHER ELECTRICITY RATES- AND- YOU KNOW THE COST FOR THESE CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS ARE ONE. ONE FACTOR ONE OF MANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO KIND OF CALIFORNIA'S RELATIVELY. HIGH RETAIL ELECTRICITY RATES AND WE THINK THAT THOSE THOSE HIGH RATES HAVE A VARIETY OF ADVERSE EFFECTS INCLUDING. ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE- DISCOURAGING ELECTROCUTION BECAUSE- THE FUEL IS IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE- AND JUST ON ON THE CANADA. ECONOMIC INEQUITY SIDE THOSE ELECTRICITY RATES. ARE ARE. KIND OF REGRESSIVE APPROACH TO RAISING REVENUE FOR- FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS FOR KIND OF CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS AND SO YOU THINK. THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT AND KIND OF YOU KNOW ALLOCATING STATE GENERAL FUNDS FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS RATHER THAN RELYING ON. ELECTRIC RATEPAYERS BACK. TO A KIND OF A DISCUSSION EARLIER AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT- THAT SURE WAS RAISING. THAT IS REALLY REALLY THIS PACKAGE WILL REQUIRE KIND OF LEGISLATURE BALANCING LONG TERM BENEFITS AGAINST NEAR TERM PRIORITIES SO. AGAIN MUCH OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING IS FOCUSED ON ACTIVITIES INTENDED TO MEET SOME OF THESE LONG TERM GOALS- ENERGY ISSUE REDUCTION BENEFITS FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ARE LIKELY TO BE RELATIVELY MODEST OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND SO. THE LETTER SAID YOU REALLY WILL HAVE TO KIND OF BALANCE SOME OF THOSE LONG TERM GOALS WITH OTHER NEARING MEDIUM TERM PRIORITIES. SUCH AS KIND OF. PROGRAMS TO MEET THE DONATED TWENTY THIRTY GHG GOALS. OTHER ENERGY RELATED PROGRAMS OR SENATOR DOLLY WAS- KIND OF HIGHLIGHTING. YOU KNOW ISSUES AROUND GRID RESILIENCY AND RELIABILITY- COULD BE KIND OF A MORE OF A NEAR TERM PRIORITY- OR JUST OTHER STATEWIDE PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME GOOD USE- GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FOR. THE FOURTH THANKS. REDUCTION COME I WANTED ON AGAIN BECAUSE OF RELATES THE AN ISSUE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHICH IS- THERE IS SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR SIMILAR ACTIVITIES- SO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NATIONWIDE FOR. THREE HUNDRED AND HUBS CARBON CAPTURE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS INDUSTRIAL MISSION DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS- IN MANY CASES THERE ISN'T DETAILED FEDERAL GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING CAN BE USED AND HOW IT WILL BE ALLOCATED AND SO- AT THIS POINT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE GOVERNOR'S. PACKAGE KIND OF STRATEGICALLY TARGETS FUNNY IN A WAY THAT BEST COMPLEMENTS THAT FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. SO FOR EXAMPLE- ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE STATE FUNDING TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS IN A WAY THAT. FURTHERS THE STATE GOALS SO SOME OF THE MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON PREVENTING OUTAGES AND ENHANCING GRID RESILIENCE. OCCUR ACQUIRE STATE MATCH- BUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE DOESN'T. HAVE ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR THAT STATE MATCH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO. EXPLORE THE ADMINISTRATION. ALSO EITHER KEYCAPS AND FEDERAL FUNDING OF THIS KIND OF. STATE FUNDING IS HELPING TO FILL. SO THAT'S- PROBABLY GOT INTO MY CAR THAT I HIGHLIGHT ON THE OVER ARCHING- PROPOSAL- JUST REAL QUICKLY I'LL TRY TO RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS IN COMMON SO WE HAVE ON THOSE ON THE EQUITABLE. EQUITABLE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION PROGRAM WHICH IS A LARGE CHUNK OF THE FUNDING HERE- WE'RE JUST RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED MINISTRATION TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON. HOW THAT PROPOSAL FITS IN WITH THE STATE'S OVERALL BUILDING DECARBONIZATION STRATEGIES SO. IN WAT ROLE WAS THE ROLE OF THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND DIRECT INSTALL PROGRAMS- RELATIVE TO OTHER POLICY CHANGES THAT COULD TRY TO ACHIEVE THE SAME GOALS SUCH AS AGAIN- COMPLEXITY RATE STRUCTURES AND CHANGES TO KIND OF ENCOURAGE. ELECTRIFICATION WHAT IMPACT WILL THE ELECTRIFICATION EFFORTS HAVE ON REMAINING NATURAL GAS COSTS AND- FOR CUSTOMERS THAT COME WITH MY CONTINUED OUT TO PAY FOR THOSE FIXED COSTS OF THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM. AND WHY IS THIS DO YOU SEE THE MOST APPROPRIATE AGENCY TO ADMINISTER THE DIRECT INSTALL PROGRAM- SO COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT IS ANOTHER STATE AGENCY THAT OPERATES A COUPLE OF. WEATHERIZATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED AT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND SO. WHAT IS IT. ABOUT WHETHER. THE DIRECTIONS PROGRAM TARGETED INCOME HOW IS LOOK AT AT AT THE INTERVIEW CAN OR ANOTHER. THE SECOND KIND OF SPECIFIC PROPOSAL I WANTED TO TOUCH ON IS THE WEARABLE PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT- WE DO THINK THIS PROPOSAL HAS POTENTIAL MERIT AS A WAY TO INTEGRATE RENEWABLE ENERGY UNDER THE GROUND- HOWEVER WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T- HASN'T PROVIDED A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS THIS PROPOSAL COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVES. SO WE RECOMMEND-THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY MINISTER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON THAT ISSUE I'M NOT I DON'T. A SECOND IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES PROVIDE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THAT PROJECT WE RECOMMENDED ADOPTION TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES ANNUAL REVENUE GENERATED FROM THIS PROJECT ONCE IT'S OPERATIONAL AND TRANSFER THAT FUND INTO THE GENERAL FUND- THIS IS BECAUSE IN OUR VIEW IT ESTATE TAX TAXPAYERS ARE PROVIDING THE FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT. TO BE REASONABLE FOR THE TAXPAYERS AND TO RECEIVE THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT- RATHER THAN KIND OF USERS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN US FINANCIAL BENEFITS.THIRD AND FINALLY- THIS IS A SMALLER PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL BUT- ENERGY RELIABILITY OFFERED CITY W. ARE THE PACKAGE INCLUDES THREE MILLION GENERAL FIND FORTY W. R. TO SUPPORT ENERGY RELIABILITY ACTIVITIES- BUT WE'RE RECOMMENDING A LETTER SENT TO REGRET THIS PIECE OF THE REQUEST BECAUSE- GWR HASN'T ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE. THAT MONEY. OVER OR KIND OF JUSTIFIED THE NEED FOR THOSE PARTICULAR RESOURCES SO. THAT WE MIGHT. THERE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YES ALI. YOU ARE THE JUST THE- START ON. THE POP STAR BECAUSE OF SOME I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH- THE I WANTED I WANTED TO ASK THE QUESTION THAT YOU WOULD USE IT SOMEWHAT- THE ONLY- SOMEWHAT ANSWERED. AND DOESN'T M. W. D. WHO RUN THE POWER PLANT RIGHT NOW THAT'S EXISTING ON ORVILLE AND NOW THOSE- RATES THE MONEY THAT IS GENERATED FROM THOSE MEGAWATTS THERE THERE. GOES INTO PAYING FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO- WOULDN'T WE WHY WOULD THE TAXPAYER BE ON THE HOOK HERE- FOR THIS PROJECT WHEN INDUCTEES ALREADY OPERATING. THE POWER OF THE ORVILLE. I BELIEVE IT'S M. W. D. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR I'M D. W. R. IS THE OPERATOR OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AND THEN WE HAVE TWENTY CONTRACTING ENTITIES THAT HELP PAY THE COSTS OF THE PROJECT AND THE BEAUTY IS ONE OF OUR LARGER CONTRACTORS AND CONTRIBUTES- MAYBE ABOUT HALF OF THE- REIMBURSABLE COSTS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. IN THE CASE OF THIS- PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT. WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MAKE THE BUSINESS CASE TO INVEST THIS INFRASTRUCTURE FROM A REPAIR PERSPECTIVES- I HAD BECAUSE THE COST BENEFIT RATIO OF THE PROJECT- IT'S NOT MAKES SENSE FROM THE WATER SUPPLY. REPAIR CHARGES- HOWEVER THE PROJECT PROVIDES YOU KNOW GREATER PUBLIC BENEFITS BY SERVING AS THIS BATTERY. THAT CAN THEN. PROVIDE RELIABLE POWER TO THE ELECTRIC GRID. SO YES CURRENTLY THE FUNDING MARKETS- ARE NOT ADEQUATE TO BASICALLY YOU KNOW PAY FOR THE PROJECTS ON ITS OWN THAT'S WHY WE'RE SPEAKING AT GENERAL FUND SUPPORTS AND THEN. YOU KNOW THE L. L. AS RECOMMENDATION- AT TAKING A LOOK AT THE NET REVENUES AND SOMETHING WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS WELL MOVING FORWARD. FIRST I I'M IN FAVOR OF POP STORAGE I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO- REUSE WATER AND WHEN WE'RE OVER PRODUCING IT TYPICALLY. DURING THE DAY WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF SUNSHINE I'M FOR THAT THE SECOND THING I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THAT AND THIS IS A DETAIL PROJECT WE HAVE THE THERMAL ITO- WE'RE WE NEED COLD WATER VERSUS. WHAT WILL FIRST ALL BAG NEEDS WARM WATER FISH DEEP COLD WATER- AND SO HOW DOES THAT INTEGRATE WITH THEIR MALITO AND HOW THAT PROJECT IS GOING TO- INTACT FISH OPERATE. THE FIRST AS AS A PUMPED STORAGE FACILITY IS THAT. WATER DOES WARM UP IN THE FAMILY- AFTER BAY AND SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO ADD HERE IS THAT AT TAPPING INTO THE COLDER PORTION. OF LAKE OROVILLE- TO OFFSET THAT WARMING EFFECTS THAT OCCUR- DURING PUMP STORAGE OPERATIONS- AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO. PROVIDE SOME GRAPHICS- AFTER THIS THIS- HEARING I HAD TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL IF THAT'S HELPFUL SENATOR THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I'M VERY. FAMILIAR WITH THE PROJECT AND I'M ALSO FAMILIAR WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE- ACT VERSUS- YOU KNOW THE TYPES OF WATER TO COME OUT OF THAT PROJECT SO- THAT WOULD LOOK FOR THAT SO MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE. NOT ONLY WAS IT THAT POKE ABOUT THE INDUSTRIAL- IN CALIFORNIA THE- DECARBONISING INDUSTRIAL SO I WANT TO DO AEROBIC ANYBODY CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION. WHAT WE SEE IN LEAKAGE IT WHEN I SAY LEAKAGE I MEAN COMPANIES THAT HAVE- CEMENT MANUFACTURERS IN MY DISTRICT THAT- HAVE SHUT DOWN IN THE PAST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET PERMITTED AND IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO DO WORK IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY MOVE THEIR COMPANIES. OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA STILL TRUCKING- THEIR THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE CALIFORNIA- SHIPPING THEM INTO CALIFORNIA- IS THERE EVEN ANY STUDIES DONE THAT SHOW THAT SHOW HOW MUCH CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT DUE TO- ART TRYING TO OFFSET OUR CARBON- THAT ACTUALLY PUSHES. COMPANIES OUT OF CALIFORNIA OR TO OTHER NATIONS- AND THEN WE STILL GET THE PRODUCTS IN HERE BUT WHAT ART- DONE IN A- ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY WAY- BOARD. THIS IS THE MAN NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GOOD MORNING. THE- INFORMATION AVAILABLE SO OUR COLLEAGUES OVER AT THEIR BORDERS AND- I DON'T HAVE THOSE STUDIES LOOKING BUT I WILL- COORDINATE WITH THEM AND GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT QUESTION. I WOULD REALLY PERSON I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR. A LONG TIME ABOUT. YOU KNOW. IN CALIFORNIA WE SAW OVER THE LAST. SEVERAL YEARS NOW. COMPANIES LEAVING CALIFORNIA. IN DROVES AND THAT'S A TAX BASE THAT WE NEED HERE. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S- MONEY THAT HAS BEEN PUMPED IN BY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS US. WE WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS OVERSEEING DEBT PILED ON TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WERE SEEN PEOPLE LEAVE CALIFORNIA IN DROVES- QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH TO DO BUSINESS HERE AND OUR REGULAR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. IS REALLY STRICT SO I NEED THERE SOMEBODY HAS TO DO THE EVALUATION OF ARE WE REALLY ENVIRONMENT AND FOR JUST PUSHING COMPANIES AND WORK FORCE OUT OF CALIFORNIA. TO SUPPLY THOSE PRODUCTS BACK INTO CALIFORNIA FROM EITHER ANOTHER NATION ANOTHER STATE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE HERE. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE LEAKAGES AND IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WE CAN GET AN ANSWER ON THAT BUT I DO KNOW- AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT THAT THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES THAT- HAVE RELOCATED. TO NEVADA OR SOME OTHER STATE OR ACTUALLY OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND THEY'RE SHIPPING- THOSE PRODUCTS BACK INTO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT'S- THEY CAN DO IT CHEAPER THERE THAN ON THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND- WE'RE STILL USING THOSE SO- THAT HURTS OUR TAX BASE AND IT HURTS OUR JOB MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN HER SEAT VARMINT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE SAME. LAWS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO TO LEAD THE NATION. WELL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD. GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE IN THE PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED. THAT DELIVERED TO CALIFORNIA ARE ACTUALLY PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M LIKE WHAT WE'VE SEEN. OVER THE PAST A COUPLE YEARS NOW WITH THE- OIL IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE DON'T. WE'RE NOT PRODUCING AS MUCH AS WE CAN IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE'RE EXPERTS OVER BRINGING EXPERTS IN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT WE'RE STILL. MORE POLLUTING THE WORLD. SOMEWHERE ELSE NOT HERE AND DRIVING THE COST OF LIVING UP IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR- INFORMATION I LOOK FORWARD TO- THE LEAKAGE INFORMATION FROM SOMEBODY I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD SUPPLY THAT MAYBE ELLY ELLS OFFICE- COULD DO A STUDY ON HOW MUCH HOW MANY JOBS WE ARE HOW MANY COMPANIES HAVE LEFT CALIFORNIA- OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. DUE TO THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT BUT STILL SELL THEIR PRODUCTS HERE. THAT SHOULD BE THE CARPENTRY BUT- PORTION OF THE AIRPORT- WE'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED BY THE ALLEY- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCEEDS FROM OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM DON'T GO TO THE COVERED ENTITY'S SWITCHER 75% OF THE POLLUTING ENTITIES WE SEE THAT THE INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION AND THE FOOD PRODUCTION- INVESTMENTS OUR GENERAL FUND- HIGH INVESTMENTS NOT CAP AND TRADE REVENUES OF. WE SEE THAT BUT ALSO THERE'S JUST A GENERAL FLAVOR THAT THE POLLUTER SHOULD PAY BUT WE KNEW THAT WE SAY IF YOU'RE POLLUTING IF YOU'RE EXTERNALITIES ARE SET TO BE PAYING FOR THAT SO. CAN YOU. EITHER CLARIFY OUR- THESE MONIES ANTICIPATED TO GO TO THE 25% OF THE POLLUTERS THAT ARE NOT COVERED AS A CARROT. FOR THE FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENTS IN THE INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION. BETTER I CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION IT WOULD- OUR OUR INTENTION IS NOT TO NARROW THEFIELD OF POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS WE WOULD NOT BE FUNDING DIRECTLY- THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE BUT WE WOULD BE BRINGING DOWN- COMPANIES AS AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE FOOD FOOD PRODUCERS PROGRAM WE WOULD BE BRINGING DOWN THEIR COSTS. AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS THAT WE MAKE A STATE INVESTMENT WE WITH WITH- WITH AFTER WE WORK WE ARE FUNDED I BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT 60% OF THE INVESTMENT WE REQUIRE 40% MATCH SO THE INDUSTRIES. ARE ALL REQUIRED TO PUT IN FUNDS THEMSELVES BUT ONCE THE PROJECTS ARE DONE THE SAVINGS ARE DURABLE THEY GO ON WELL INTO THE FUTURE SO ONCE THE EFFICIENCIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED- THEY EVERY YEAR CAN SAVE MONEY IF THEY CAN HELP WITH THAT. QUESTION THE JOBCENTRE DOLLAR RAISED AS WELL ABOUT COMPANIES- THE COMPANY'S COST. NO I NOT IN A WE HAD A- OUR ISSUE THAT TWO WE- ANIMATORS COACHING ABOUT THE COST PER METRIC TON AND MIKE MATHIS SAYING THAT THIS MAY BE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER METRIC TON. AT LEAST ON THE FOOD PRODUCTION. INVESTMENT SO YOU KNOW THERE'S IT'S RIGHT IT'S A- MERE. EIGHTY FIVE MILLION VERSUS SIX POINT ONE BILLION. OTHERS THAT THAT SORT OF JUMPS OUT AT THE TYPICAL LEGISLATORS- THAT OU'RE DOING. YOU'RE DOING- THE- EQUITABLE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON. HAVING PEOPLE GO WHEN INPUTTING AN ELECTRIC. EQUIPMENT HAVING PEOPLE- GET REBATES TO BUY ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AND IT CAN SHE WIN SEE LITTLE BIT ABOUT GOOD OLD FASHIONED WEATHERIZATION. NO I'LL GO BACK TO MY SHINY PENNY IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE- WE'VE HAD A ANIMATED- WRESTLING MATCH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON ON REFERRED TO FUNDING FOR REFRIGERATED FRIENDS FUNDING FOR WEATHERIZATION IT SEEMS THAT WE ALWAYS GET PUSHED BACK UP TO SEE THAT YOU GUYS ARE PROPOSING SOMETHING BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE DOING SORT OF. THE BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES IN THE ALLEY- ASK WHY WEISS FOOD ENERGY COMMISSION VERSUS THE VIET- HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THAT DOES THESE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION ME TO MY READING THE PROPOSAL WRONG. NO I THINK YOU DESCRIBED IT ACCURATELY IN TERMS OF- THE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING OUR PROPOSAL TO DIVIDE THE FUNDS WE'RE LOOKING AT- THE BULK OF THE FUNDS GOING TO THE DIRECT INSTALL SO SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION OUT OF THE OUT OF THE TOTAL BALANCE OF THREE MILLION GOING TO- TO REBATE PROGRAM. AND- THE DIRECT INSTALL WE WOULD NOT BE LOOKING JUST ELECTRIC APPLIANCES WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT BUILDING ENVELOPE SO INSULATION WINDOWS ETCETERA AND YES THERE ARE SIMILARITIES TO WHAT SHE HAS TO THE COMMUNITY- CHOOSE A DEVELOPMENT THAT DIVISION DOES- BUT IT WOULD WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM WE DO THINK THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS THE RIGHT ENTERTAINMENT TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS. THE PROGRAM IS MUCH NARROWER- IT FOCUSES MUCH MORE ON INTEREST ENVELOPE SO WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE. PACKAGE THAT- APPLE MAPS BUT- DOESN'T DUPLICATE WHAT THEY- AND WILL BE CLOSELY TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT YOU KNOW NOT DOING THE SAME SORT OF THING IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE SAME. CERTAINLY NOT THE SAME TOPICS. MR BROWN ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY BUDGET REQUEST BY THIS ADMINISTRATION ON. HISTORY THE GENERAL. HAVE SOMEBODY COME BY AND COCKY WINDOWS TO SCUM HELLO YOU KNOW LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR WEATHER RISING- OUR APARTMENTS AND HOMES AND BUSINESSES. DID I MISS IT IN THE BUDGET. WELL THAT WOULD BE THAT. OTHER THAN THIS PROPOSAL JUST THE JUST THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THAT UP WITH OTHER AGENCIES NOT WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION. YEAH I APOLOGIES IF- RIGHT I THINK IT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS ME BUT- MR BOAG CAN KIND OF JUMP IN AS WELL- I THINK- I I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK IN THE PART OF FINANCE MIGHT HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON THAT I THINK THERE WAS. SOME FUNDING FOR A KIND OF- LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION AS PART OF KIND OF THE RESILIENCY PACKAGE LAST YEAR DON'T- I HAVE TO KIND OF GO BACK AND DOUBLE CHECK THAT. THERE IS SOME KIND OF GOING BACK TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUE AS PART OF THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE. PACKAGE THERE WAS A FINDING OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR WEATHERIZATION TYPE ACTIVITIES- AND CST KIND OF HAS ITS KIND OF ONGOING PROGRAMS RELATED TO THAT ISSUE SO. THERE IS SOME MONEY IN THERE AND HAVE TO AGAIN I CAN KIND OF GO BACK AND TRY TO PULL TOGETHER SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT ARE KIND OF SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO. YOU AND YOUR SPOUSE. SERGIO I GO OUT WITH THE PART OF- I COULD JUST JUMP IN HERE REAL QUICK AND- YET. THEY'RE LUCKY CAREER FUNDING PROVIDED AT PART OF LAST YEAR'S MULTI YEAR PACKAGE OF BILLS. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THERE'S NOTHING ADDITIONAL- TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND THEN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE MILLION IMPORTS YEAH. THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM SO THERE IS ALREADY. A FUNDING. IN THE BUDGET WORD A COUPLE YEARS. YEAH YOUR CURRENT PROGRAM. I DON'T THIS. NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION TWENTY FIVE MILLION NINE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION TWENTY FIVE MILLION SO WE CAN I REMEMBER THOSE DEBATES WITH FINANCE TO GET THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN THERE THAT DIDN'T PAN IN THE BUDGET DISCUSSION SO I JUST DRAW SOME ATTENTION DEAR TO SOME OF THE LESS POPULAR TYPE PROGRAMS THAT ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS SO MAYBE WE SHOULD STEP BACK IN IN THE PAST THE OVERALL STRATEGY YEAH BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE LONG TERM VERSUS THE SHORT TERM AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION AND THE REFRIGERATION PROGRAMS CREATE MUCH MORE BENEFITS IN THE SHORT TERM. AND I GUESS I'M LOOKING FOR THE THOUGHT PROCESS TO SEE MINISTRATION WENT THROUGH WHEN BALANCING THE SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM INVESTMENTS- AND IS THERE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT DOING MORE IN THE SHORT TERM TO DRIVE STEEPER EMISSIONS. IN THE NEAR TERM YOU KNOW I GUESS AGAIN TO FIGHT. LET'S JUST BRING UP THE REFRIGERANT PROGRAM PUT MORE MONEY IN THERE TO GET THE GET THE BENEFIT OF IT. US SENATOR. REBEL AND I WOULD RESPOND. TO THAT BY SAYING IF YOU LOOK AT THE- BIG TICKET ITEMS THAT WOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE ENERGY COMMISSION- ABOUT HALF THE FUNDING. GOES TOWARDS BUILDING THIS IS VERY SHORT TERM SO WE NEED TO BUILD THE PROGRAM WE NEED TO DO THE PUBLIC OUTRAGE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE WE'RE DESIGNING IT PROPERLY WE WANT TO BE A MIX OF THE SORT OF- WHY WITH TYPE STUFF THAT. THE INSULATION- THE WEATHER IS ATION. COUPLED WITH THE LONGER TERM SO EVEN IN ONE PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING AT PAUL FOR A LOOK AT A QUICK INSTALLS DON'T HAPPEN QUICKLY. BUT THE- ADDRESS BOTH THE IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION AND DEMAND- ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS AND THEY'LL START MOVING TOWARDS- GETTING MORE ELECTRIC APPLIANCES IN THE- HOMES. THAT THEY CAN HELP WITH OUR- COMMUNITY OUT THERE TO BUILD THE- THE- BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT IS IN THE BUSINESS- MAKING YOUR- CONNECTIONS. IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO THAT ONE DEFINITELY A SHORT TERM. INDUSTRIAL AFTER THAT YOU POINTED OUT VERY GOOD VALUE LOW COST PER PER TON- ALSO VERY QUICK WE'VE WE'VE GOT MANY OF THOSE PROJECTS COMPLETE ALREADY AND IT'S ONLY A COUPLE YEAR OLD PROGRAM. WE THINK IT'LL STILL BE CURRENT CAN BE THE SAME THING. THE OTHER ONES ARE LONGER TERM WE ARE LOOKING AT LONGER RATIONS STORAGE AS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF. IF YOU TAKE THIS CAN TAKE SOME INVESTMENTS WE'VE GOT SOME TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'VE INVESTED IN WE'VE GOT OTHERS THAT WE SPENT STUDYING. AND WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE JUST ON THE CUSP OF BEING ABLE TO SCALE AND SO THESE INVESTMENTS WILL YIELD RESULTS IN THE SAME TIME FRAME AS THE OTHERS. BUT THEY THEY WERE HOPEFUL THAT THEY COULD BE AVAILABLE QUICKLY HI JIM ALSO WHEN SIMILARLY THESE TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER. ARE ARE YOU. ARE REPEATS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DRIVE THE KIND OF- APPLIANCES ADAPTATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. OTHER OTHER SORT OF POLICY TOOLS YOU COULD USE. ORDERED I MEAN THAT'S BECAUSE- IDEALLY WE'D WE'D- WE- REALLY LIKED THE FLEXIBILITY WE PUT FORTH THE DIVISION OF TWO THIRDS ONE THIRD TWO THIRDS DIRECT INSTALL FOR A REBATE. BUT WE WHAT WE WANT TO WORKSHOP THAT AND FIND OUT IN ONE MAY PROVE TO BE A BIT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE OTHER WE HAVE ESTIMATES ON WHAT THE COST PER TON WILL BE FOR EACH. BUT YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN AND EXPECT TO DO SO DURING THE- DURING THE- OPERATION THAT WE CONDUCTED. WELL I KNOW THAT THE- TURNING TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE SIMILAR ACTIVITIES HELLO IN TWENTY THREE OF OUR STAFF REPORT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CLEAN ENERGY HYDROGEN HUBS I'LL JUST NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE SECOND MOST HYDROGEN STATIONS IN THE WORLD. IN BED NEXT TO JAPAN AND I KNOW THAT ENERGY COMMISSION IS PROUD OF THAT AND IF WE JUST DO THE TWO HUNDRED STATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS WE WILL BE NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION SO HI RIGHT OF ALL THE THINGS I'M ANXIOUS ABOUT GETTING ONE OF THE FOUR ENERGY HUBS IS NOT ONE OF THEM RIGHT THAT'S NOT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD DO BUT WE HAVE CARBON CAPTURE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. AND I KNOW NOTE THAT THE- THIS GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS SILENT ON CARBON CAPTURE FOR ELECTRIFICATION CAN YOU. IS THAT BY DESIGN IS UP BY OVERSIGHT. N. N. Y. IF IT IS. WELL IN AN INDUSTRIAL THE CURVE WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF- TAKING CARBON AND EMBEDDING IT IN PRODUCTS SO THAT FORM OF SEQUESTRATION WERE SUPPORTIVE OF WE DIDN'T THINK THAT- THE TIME FRAMES ARE ARE ARE ARE. GOOD TO BE LOOKING AT INVESTING STATE DOLLARS IN IN THE IN THE- THE SITUATION I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE WE YOU PUT IT UNDERGROUND OR OTHERWISE TRY TO MOVE IT OUT OF- OF THE ABSTRUSE LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO WE BEGIN WE'RE FOCUSING ON WHERE WE COULD PUT IN PRODUCTS. BUT THE BUT NOT THE OTHER PART IN YOUR RIGHT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY IN IN THAT SPACE IN THE- IN THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. MISTER BROWN WE YOU READ THE- LIVERMORE LABS REPORTED SAID EVEN IF WE DO EVERYTHING THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO. AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO BE A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT. METRIC TONS PER YEAR SHORT AND ONE OF THE ANSWERS HIS. NATURAL WORKING LANDS. AND DIRECT CARBON CAPTURE AND THEN- THE CARBON. ALL FASHION CARBON CAPTURE I GUESS I WOULD SAY- DOES THAT CONCERN YOU WE'VE GOT SO MUCH FEDERAL TOO ON THE- OUT THERE THAT WE COULD USE TO MEET OUR SHORT TERM AND MEDIUM TERM- CARBONATION PROBLEMS AND THEN WORK FOR LIMITING THE PROTECT THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GOOD TO GO AFTER. YEAH AND ACTUALLY THIS IS- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE- HIGHLIGHTED ARE NOW ALSO SAYS WELL AND I JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO KIND OF GET TO IT IN MY COMMENTS BUT- I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE I MEAN THERE ARE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES IN CERTAIN TYPES OF CHRONIC CARBON REDUCTION. ACTIONS THAT ARE EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM THIS PACKAGE AND THE- CARBON CAPTURE GEOLOGIC STORAGES IS ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT SO- I MEAN I THINK BIG PICTURE IN A MEETING- THE SORT OF LONG TERM DECARBONISATION GOALS BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF SIMILAR DATE IS. IT'S FRANKLY- EXTREMELY CHALLENGING AND SO THE LEGISLATURE WILL I THINK NEED TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WANTS TO. TAKE CERTAIN TYPES OF OPTIONS OF TECHNOLOGY IS OFF THE TABLE TO KINDA YOU KNOW IN MEETING THAT GOAL AND SO WHEN THERE ARE SOME TRADE OFFS I MEAN IF YOU KIND OF FEEL EXPANDED TO A LARGER SET OF POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGIES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT COULD GO TO EACH. WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT LESS BUT WE DO THINK THAT AT THIS POINT KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE AND KIND OF THING INCLUDING AS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND TRYING TO EXPLORE. WHICH ONES ARE ABLE TO KIND OF ACHIEVE THE GOALS COST EFFECTIVELY GOING FORWARD- AND KIND OF EXPLORING THOSE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES- WE THINK IT'S KIND OF A REASONABLE APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT THINK ABOUT HOW TO EXPANDING THE- THE- OF THE OF TECHNOLOGIES AND KIND OF FACILITIES THAT COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FUNDING. THERE'S VALUE IN NEAR ZERO REDUCTIONS NOT ZERO BUT NEAR IS A REDUCTION IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S PATH. AS A MYSTERY I GUESS THE NEXT QUESTION IS THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE FEDERAL PROGRAMS REQUIRE. A MATCH IN THE IN THE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT ALLOCATE ANY STATEMENTS FOR THE GRID RESILIENCY AND I WAS WONDERING. AGAIN ON THE SAME SORT OF VEIN. WHY NOT IT'S A BIT TOO HIGHLIGHTED IN PAGE TWENTY THREE OF OUR OUR OUR. STAFF REPORT WHY ARE WE NOT. DOING THAT WHEN THE FEDERAL. YOU KNOW- INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AND JOB CHECK WAS WAS OUT AND OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER WE KNOW ABOUT THAT. AND IF THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ANY OTHER GAPS IS OUR STAFF REPORT. TALKS ABOUT. BUT SENATOR I WOULD POINT TO THE THERE'S SEVERAL THERE'S A THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATUTORY ELEMENTS UNDER GREATER LIABILITY AND WE WERE LOOKING AT A BROADLY AS OTHERS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THAT THAT IS FOR THAT IS A FORMULA GRANTS TO CALIFORNIA WILL GET. SHOULD IT BE A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF ONE OF THOSE POTS OF MONEY WHICH IS A FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE USING IS A ROUGH. ESTIMATE THAT'S 10% OF THAT SO CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING TO GET FIVE OR MILLION- FROM THE- FROM THE FORMULA GRANTS. THERE'S ANOTHER FIVE BILLION IN VERY SIMILAR IT'S WORDED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY BUT IT'S VERY SIMILAR FUNDING FOR GRADE A LOT GREATER LIABILITY. AGAIN ALSO FIVE BILLION AND THAT'S COMPETITIVE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER POT SHOULD SHIP WITH UNDER THAT WITHIN THAT SO WE'RE LOOKING OF COURSE AT THE FORMULA GRANT. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN. LEVERAGE THE EXPERIENCE WE'VE GOT PERHAPS SOME OF THE FUNDING WE WE'RE WE'RE SEEKING THE LONG DURATION STORAGE FUNDING COULD BE MATCH FOR- FOR THE SCREEN RELIABILITY IT'S NOT CERTAIN YET WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH DELIA. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT WE THINK THERE MAY BE A WAYS TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE STATE'S FUNDING. AS A AS A FORM OF MATCH FOR THAT ONE CERTAINLY THAT'S TRUE FOR HYDROGEN. AND SOME OF THE OTHER. HELLO AND THAT DOG MILLION MORE CHECKING FOR. COULD BE USED LEVERAGE THE- NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN HYDROGEN FUNDING. AND THAT'S NOT FOCUSED CHIEFLY ON ON VEHICLES IT'S MORE ON OTHER ASPECTS OF HOW HIGH SHE CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THE ECONOMY. BUT I MEAN WE HAVE A THIGH AGAIN LIMIT WE'RE WITH THAT. THEN WITH THE ANTICIPATED ADDITIONAL REVENUES COMING IN IT SEEMS LIKE THOSE ARE. YOU KNOW WE'RE I'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOOK AT PROJECTS ARE LOOK AT. INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD HELP US COME UNDER THE CAN LIMIT- AND IT SEEMS TO ME IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PUTTING MONEY IN. AND JUST SIT. THIS PICKING CARBON CAPTURE THIS HERE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PARALLELS THOUGH SO THAT WE CAN PARTICIPATE AT LEAST COMPETITIVELY. INSTEAD OF. CHOOSING WINNERS AND LOSERS NOW BEFORE HER. YOU KNOW IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. WE GOT TO THREE TO GET TO. BUY MY SHINY PENNY SIZED IN THE SKY.

OKAY MORNING CARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU TERROR HOUSEKI HONORABLE SENATORS RACHEL PETERSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION YES WE HAVE THE NEXT SEVERAL ITEMS ON THE AGENDA AND- BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TOWARDS SIXTY CHEAP ALE J. WHO'S GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT- ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF TOP LINE POINTS ABOUT ALL THE PROPOSALS TODAY- WE ARE WE HAVE CAREFULLY DESIGNED THEM TO ACCOMPLISH THE PERMANENT AND ONGOING WORK LOAD THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SET OUT FOR US THAT'S TRUE THAT'S DRIVEN BY OUR STATUTORY RULES AND MANDATES- SET OUT BY THE LEGISLATURE ACROSS THE SECTORS THAT WE REGULATE SO ENERGY TRANSPORTATION TELECOMMUNICATIONS. CYBERSECURITY AND CLEAN WATER. NEXT POINT IS WE ARE INVESTING OVER TO OUR RESOURCES STRATEGICALLY WE SCANNED OUR CORE OPERATIONS AND IDENTIFY THE AREAS- WHERE WE DO HAVE AN INCREASED PERMANENT AND ONGOING WORK LOAD. WITHIN THOSE CORE OPERATIONS DRIVEN BY LEGISLATION AGAIN DRIVEN BY NEW COMPLIANCE CONTROLS- THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL AUDITS AND BY INCREASED PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS. NOW WE DEFINITELY TAKE A LEAN APPROACH TO THOSE CORE OPERATIONAL PROPOSALS AND REALLY TRY TO ONLY FOCUS RESOURCES RESOURCE REQUESTS WHERE THEY ARE TRULY NEEDED. AND THEN THE LAST OUR PROPOSALS I BELIEVE ARE ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S AMBITIOUS POLICY GOALS WHICH HAVE BEEN UNDER ROBUST DISCUSSION THIS MORNING- BUT ESPECIALLY AROUND CLEAN ENERGY BROADBAND FOR ALL THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER AND SAFE- PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING WE HAVE ALL OF OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS LINED UP TO TAKE THROUGH THE ISSUES ON THE AGENDA. AND WE WILL ALL BE HERE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU TURNED OUT TO BE ASSISTANT CHIEF. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE PAXSON. THANK YOU ALL- GOOD MORNING SHARE THE MORNING SENATORS MY NAME IS PAT THEN I AM AN ASSISTANT CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE IN A- J. DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I AM PRESENTING ON AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOUR- BE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE DIVISION MANAGEMENT AND PRECEDING SUPPORT. WE'RE REQUESTING A TOTAL OF EIGHT POSITIONS WHICH INCLUDES ONE ASSISTANT CHIEF ALJ FIVE SUPPORT STAFF POSITIONS AND TO ASSUME SEATED MANAGERS. AS DETAILED IN THE AGENDA THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE DIVISION CONDUCTS FORMAL PROCEEDINGS SIMILAR TO A COURT SYSTEM AND HAS TWO BASIC RESPONSIBILITIES. ONE CONDUCTING HEARINGS CONSISTENT WITH DUE PROCESS TO DEVELOP A COMPLETE EVIDENTIARY RECORD TO SUPPORT PROPOSED DECISIONS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE COMMISSION. AND TO ADMINISTER THE CPUC. DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THIS DIVISION ALSO ACTS AS AN APPELLATE BODY WHEN AN ENTITY CITED THROUGH ONE OF THE COMMISSION'S TWENTY SEVEN CITATION PROGRAMS FILES AN APPEAL. THIS B. C. P. IS DESIGNED TO MAKE STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT OUR COURT SYSTEM FUNCTIONS BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. HE HAS TWO ELEMENTS FIRST ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT POSITIONS TO PROVIDE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW AND TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT TURNOVER AND THE NEED FOR RECRUITMENT HIRING AND TRAINING. AND SECOND ANALYST IN SUPPORT POSITIONS PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO BAIL J. N. A. L. G. MANAGEMENT. FIRST ON THE MANAGEMENT ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL. DUE TO RETENTION ISSUES FOR THE ALJ POSITION WHERE AT 20% ANNUAL TURNOVER WITHIN RANK AND FILE HE'LL CHASE OUR JUDGES HAVE LESS THAN THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WHICH IS TYPICALLY THE TIME IT TAKES FOR NEW A. L. J. AT THE C. P. U. C. TO BECOME FULLY TRYING. THIS MEANS THAT YOUR AGING MANAGEMENT MUST SPEND ADDITIONAL TIME TO TRAIN AND REVIEW WORK PRODUCTS. AS WELL AS CLOSELY MONITOR PROCEEDINGS SOTHAT WE CAN CONTINUE- WITHIN THEIR SUBJECT OVERSIGHT. WITH THIS REQUEST WE'RE REQUESTING ONE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANT CHIEF TECHNOLOGY POSITIONS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO FILL OUR VACANCIES AND PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT FOR THE JUDGES. THIS PORTION OF THE REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES CHIEF ANALYST POSITIONS THAT WILL PROVIDE ANALYTICAL AND PROGRAM SUPPORT TO THE NINE MEMBERS OF THE LG MANAGEMENT TEAM. CURRENTLY WE SHARE ONE LEGAL SECRETARY THAT PERFORMS DOCUMENT PROCESSING FUNCTIONS. SECOND WE'RE REQUESTING PROCEEDING SUPPORT FOR THE JUDGES IN THE FORM OF TWO ADDITIONAL ANALYSTS AND ONE LEGAL SECRETARY. FOR EACH FORMAL PROCEEDING AT THE C. P. U. C. THERE IS AN ASSIGNED COMMISSIONER AND ONE OR MORE ASSIGNED ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. UP TO FIVE HUNDRED PROCEEDINGS ARE OPENED AND CLOSED EACH YEAR WITH APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE OPEN AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ASSISTS THE ASSIGNED COMMISSIONER IN DETERMINING SCOPE FOR EACH PRECEDING. DEVELOPS THE PRECEDING RECORD CONDUCTS HEARINGS AND PREPARES PROPOSED DECISIONS FOR COMMISSION CONSIDERATION. ALL WITHIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIMELINES. THESE POSITIONS WILL PROVIDE DIRECT PROCEEDING MANAGEMENT AND DOCUMENT PROCESSING SUPPORT TO JUDGES. OUR STATUTORY PERIOD FOR COMPLETING PROCEEDINGS WERE SHORTENED BY S. B. TWO OH FIVE. POLITICIAN ALL REQUIREMENTS WERE ADDED TO IMPROVE PUBLIC ACCESS AND TRANSPARENCY THIS TEAM WILL HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET THOSE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND SERVE FUNCTIONS SIMILAR TO PARALEGALS OR COURT CLERKS IN THE CIVIL COURT SYSTEM. WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE MORE COMPLEX LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR HEARINGS THAT WE'RE HOLDING REMOTELY AND IN HYBRID FORM. THE LAST POINT THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT OUR DIVISION HAS UNDERGONE A TRANSFORMATION IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AS YOUR AGENDA POINTS OUT WE HAVE HIRED THIRTEEN JUDGES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND TWO OF THOSE YEARS WERE DURING THE CALL THAT PENDANT. BY ADDRESSING BOTH MANAGING MANAGEMENT AND ANALYTICAL SUPPORT. IT'S B. C. P. IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN TRAIN OUR NEW JUDGES. BRING THEM UP TO SPEED. AND MAKE OUR COURT SYSTEM FUNCTION WELL TO MANAGE OUR FORMAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ADDRESS ALL ASPECTS OF THE ESSENTIAL UTILITY SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIANS. SERVICE RELIABILITY EQUITABLE ACCESS PUBLIC SAFETY AND AFFORDABILITY STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN A L. G. DIVISION ONE AND A. O. J. MANAGEMENT AND THE OTHER INDIRECT PROCEEDING SUPPORT TO JUDGES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS VERY THOROUGH DIGESTION- MISTER BROWN DO YOU HAVE ANY OBSERVATIONS ON THE- LG DIVISION MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL. MR SURE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND- IN CASE IT'S HELPFUL WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES OR CONCERNS WITH THE REST OF THE KIND OF ITEMS ON THE AGENDA OF COURSE WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. YOU SEE THAT THEY WERE GONNA BE ON THE HOT SEAT THIS IS THE START IS STARTED I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE SHOULD WE EXPECT A DECREASE IN THE TURNOVER WITH THESE RESOURCES I MEAN YOU'VE OUTLINED THAT THERE THERE COULD BE A SIGN THERE- AND- IS SET. TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD EXPECT IT SHOULD IT BE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE. TRAINING AND MORE BACK OF SUPPORT HIS SECOND HELP WITH THE TURNOVER PROBLEM OR SUGGEST SOMETHING ABOUT. THE P. YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE LEAVE. ALSO THE FIRST ON THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR SO- THAT'S RECEIVING SUPPORT THAT THE- LAID OUT REALLY DOES ACTUALLY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THE JOB- EXPERIENCE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES. THE LAST TIME THAT YOU NEED TO SPEND ON- SUPPORT ITEMS LIKE MARSHALING EVIDENCE AND INSURING THAT I. T. WORKS FOR THE HEARINGS THAT ARE MANAGING HONESTLY THE HAPPIER THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY GET TO FOCUS ON THE REASON THAT THEY BECAME AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE HIGHLY INTERESTING SUBSTANCE. THE PROCEEDINGS THAT WE. ANYTHING ELSE. TO ADD I JUST THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE. TELL CHANGES YET AND THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT- B. B. THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE HERE IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS SORT OF THE TURNOVER AT THE RETENTION ISSUES- THERE ARE STRUCTURAL THINGS THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A ENVIRONMENT. WHERE JUDGES ARE ABLE TO WORK ON THE VERY INTERESTING WORK THAT WE DO HERE- AND THEY'RE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE SUBSTANCE- ON THE LG MANAGEMENT SITE- THE ADDITIONAL- ASSISTANT CHIEF ALJ IS REALLY ALSO INTENDED TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST. TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO JUDGES SO THAT WE AVOID BURNOUT AND THAT- WE ARE ABLE TO RETAIN REALLY SMART AND GOOD PEOPLE AS THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AS THEY BECOME BETTER AT MANAGING PROCEEDINGS AT THE COMMISSION. THANK YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW STEP INSTRUCTIONS- RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP THIS MATTER OPEN THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND THE CLARIFICATION ON ON THE PROGRAM AND WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS AUTHORIZATION FOR PERMANENT FUNDING OF LIMIT OF KEY LIMITED TERM POSITIONS. IN SUPPORT OF ENERGY POLICY STATUTES AND WE HAVE. HER BACKGROUND PROVIDES ALL THE STATUTES STEP WE'RE. GOING TO HAVE COVERED PLEASE GO AHEAD. UGH MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND GOOD MORNING SENATORS- MY NAME IS NICK SAID JOHNNY I'M WITH THE CQC'S ENERGY DIVISION PRESENTING ON THIS ITEM. WE ARE REQUESTING AUTHORIZATION FOR PERMANENT FUNDING OF NINETEEN AND A HALF HE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO BE MADE. PERMANENT AND THAT SUPPORT WORK CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING ELEVEN SEPARATE ENERGY POLICY STATUTES WHICH YOU REFERENCED MR CHAIRMAN. IN AREAS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON MICRO GRIDS AND RESILIENCY- BIOMETHANE ENERGY STORAGE INTERCONNECTION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY CUSTOM PROJECTS. WE ORIGINALLY RECEIVED THIRTY ONE AND A HALF POSITIONS TO PERFORM THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATUTES. WE HAVE TRIMMED DOWN THIS REQUEST BY TWELVE POSITIONS ARE JUST SHORT OF FIFTY PERCENT. THE ORIGINAL REQUESTS WERE- RELATED TO NASCENT INDUSTRIES AND WE'VE HAD SOME TIME SINCE THEN TO DETERMINE WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE AND THAT IS WHAT'S REFLECTED. IN THIS PARTICULAR BCP BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT THE PERMANENT WORKLOAD WOULD BE AND WHAT WOULD INVOLVE- SO WE ARE REQUESTING NINETEEN AND A HALF- POSITIONS TO BE MADE PERMANENT- THEY WILL CONTINUE THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE CQC'S WORK AND SPECIFICALLY- THE POSITIONS ENCOMPASS THE ENTIRE MICROGRID SECTION WITHIN ENERGY DIVISION FROM THE SUPERVISOR DOWN TO ALL THE STAFF AND THEY ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE INCREASED RELIABILITY. REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK AND REDUCE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS TO BUILD EXTENSIVE TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE. MICRO GRIDS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO HELP CALIFORNIA RESPOND TO THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE DISRUPTIONS IN THE LARGER GRID INCLUDING THE PS PS EVENTS THAT SENATOR DALLY. REFERENCED EARLIER. HAVING THE POSITIONS IN PLACE TO CONTINUE MY PROGRESS POLICY WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE PRETTY CLEARLY AND HERE TO STRICT SAFETY STANDARDS AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND TO FILL THEIR POTENTIAL TO GENUINELY IMPROVE. RESILIENCY AND REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK CAN ALSO SAVE MONEY FOR REPAIRS. THE BIO ENERGY POSITIONS ENCOMPASS ALL OF OUR RENEWABLE GAS AND BIOFUELS STAFF WITH AN INTEGER DIVISION AND ALL OF THE STAFF DEDICATED TO GASIFICATION WORK AND ENERGY PRODUCTION WORK ASSOCIATED WITH BIOMASS PROCESSING. AND THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO HELP US REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND TO DECARBONIZE OUR FUEL MOVING FORWARD AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE LOCAL AIR QUALITY EMISSIONS. BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN AND OTHER CLEAN FUELS- THESE POSITIONS ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL IN IMPLEMENTING THE RENEWABLE GAS STANDARD BUT THE PC JUST ADOPTED AT ITS LAST VOTING MEETING. LAST WEEK. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY POSITIONS ARE CENTRAL TO IMPLEMENTING THE STATUTE THAT REQUIRES US TO PROVIDE ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF CUSTOM ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS THAT HAVE TO BE REVIEWED ON A TIMELY BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH REPAIR INTEREST. THOSE PROJECTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO GROW ABOUT 20% OVER THE NEXT DECADE SO HAVING A STAFF IN PLACE TO PERFORM THE STATUTORY CHARLIE REQUIRED FUN IN THE MANNER. IS ESSENTIAL. AND FINALLY THE ENERGY STORAGE INTERCONNECTION POSITIONS ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATE'S ABILITY TO COST EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ENERGY STORAGE TO SUPPORT G. SHE REDUCTIONS FOR LIABILITY AND RENEWABLES INTEGRATION- AS ENERGY STORAGE QUICKLY BECOMES THE DOMINANT RESOURCE BEING TORTURED AND INTEGRATED INTO THE GRID. THE CQC BY APPROVING THIS B. C. P. WILL HAVE THE STAFF RESOURCES NEEDED TO CONDUCT EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OF THIS RAPIDLY GROWING AREA OF PROCUREMENT. REPAIRS ARE ALREADY PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR BULK ENERGY STORAGE AND THE CQC STAFF PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN EVALUATING WHICH PROJECTS TO IMPROVE SO THAT ENERGY STORAGE RESULTS IN NET SAVINGS AND NOT NET COSTS. TO REPAIRS WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING RELIABILITY GHG REDUCTION AND RENEWABLES INTEGRATION FURTHERMORE THE INTERCONNECTION POSITIONS WILL SUPPORT EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE INTERCONNECTION WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. AS DRAMATIC INCREASES IN THE QUANTITY AND COMPLEXITY OF NEW DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES ARE ADDED TO THE GRID AND WITH THAT I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SUPERVISORS. THE JOHNNY- MR BROWN. THREE YEARS AGO THE ENERGY COMMISSION CAME TO US ASK FOR THIRTY ONE AND A HALF POSITIONS LIMITED TERM AND THEY WERE GOING TO WORK ON ALL THIS PRODUCT NOW THEY'RE BACK THREE YEARS LATER AND SAYING HEY WE WANT TO CONVERT NINETEEN AND A HALF OF THESE POSITIONS TO FULL TO PERMANENT POSITIONS IT'S ALMOST A MODEL OF HOW STATE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RUN BUT WE HAVE A GOAL WE HAVE THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE PASS ALL THIS LEGISLATION TWENTY SIXTEEN WE COME IN WE WANT TO DO LIMITED TERM WE'RE GOING TO GET IT TOGETHER. AND THEN I GUESS PEOPLE COULD SEE THE GET THIS THE LEGISLATURE DEMANDED THAT YOU HAVE LIMITED TERM AND COME BACK TO US REPORT TO US IT'S ALMOST I COULD TEACH A GRADUATE CLASS ON HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS HERE FIVE WOULD YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT OR AGREE WITH THOSE THOSE OBSERVATIONS. MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING AND AGREE THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE KIND OF A GOOD EXAMPLE OF- KIND OF THE BUDGET PROCESS WORKING IN SORT OF WHY YOU HAVE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WHEN THE- ONGOING WORKLOAD IS IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THERE'S KIND OF A NEW PROGRAMMER NEW INDUSTRIES AND O. IMPROVING THEM ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS AND THEN RE ASSESSING WHAT THE ONGOING WORKLOAD. IS GOING FORWARD- SEEMS LIKE A- VERY REASONABLE APPROACH TO US AND THAT'S WHY WE KIND OF OFTEN RECOMMEND THAT APPROACH AND IT SEEMS LIKE- THAT'S APPROACH THAT IS BEING TAKEN HERE IT SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY WELL. VERY GOOD EXCELLENT REPORT SUPERVISORS AND CONNIE AND WE WILL KEEP THIS MATTER OPEN AND I THE REASON I DWELL ON THAT THE BENEFIT THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM SO THAT THE BLANKET EXEMPTION WERE.

AND MOREOVER IT WILL ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO CONTINUE EMPOWERING PROTECTING CALIFORNIA THROUGH ACCESS TO SAFE RELIABLE AND REASONABLE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

COMMUNITY FINE AFTER HE GOT THERE THAT DAY BUT HE GOT A FEW THAT ARE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM YET THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNDED FOR OVER TEN YEARS. AND CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED. OUR TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROGRAM FOR PROVIDING MULTIPLE BENEFITS OF SOCIAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT RECOGNIZED BY MISTREATMENT DISCONNECTING COMPLETE DISREGARD.
