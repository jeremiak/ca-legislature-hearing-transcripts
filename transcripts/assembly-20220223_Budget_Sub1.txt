BEFORE WE INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL TO BEGIN I WILL MAKE JUST A FEW INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS YEAR HAS BEEN TWO FOLD WE ARE FIRST REVIEWING PRIORITY ISSUES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND SECOND WE ARE EXERCISING OUR CRITICAL OVERSIGHT ROLE FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS THAT ARE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. AS PART OF BOTH OF THESE EXERCISES WE DISCUSS AND DELIBERATE ON WHAT ADDITIONAL MEANINGFUL CHANGES THIS TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET CAN FACILITATE TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD SOLVING THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS FACING OUR STATE. POVERTY AND ITS SIBLINGS OF HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS ARE PERVASIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR DISTINCTION OF HAVING THE HIGHEST RATE IN THE NATION MEANS THAT THERE REALLY ARE TO CALIFORNIA'S. ONE WHERE THE DREAM OF SELF SUFFICIENCY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND PERSONAL SAFETY AND SUCCESS AS POSSIBLE AND ONE WHERE IT IS NOT. TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM A PANEL ON ENDING POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA INFORMING US ABOUT THE VISION OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS ON A POPULATION SCALE IN OUR STATE. AND THEN WE'LL DISCUSS THE CORE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AND EACH OF THEIR ROLES WITH THE GOAL OF ENDING POVERTY CENTRAL TO THIS DISCUSSION. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY AND LEARNING AND TALKING ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE BRAIN IMPACTS OF POVERTY TRAUMA AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WE HAVE THE INFORMATION AND TOOLS TO TAKE ACTION TO END POVERTY I HOPE THAT TODAY'S DISCUSSION WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR BIG STEPS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BUDGET TO END POVERTY TO CLOSE RACIAL AND ETHNIC GAPS AND TO MAKE PERSON CENTERED OUTCOMES THAT ALLEVIATE SUFFERING. A CORE PART OF OUR EFFORTS WORKING FORWARD. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE AGENDAS FOR TODAY WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN. OUR FIRST PANEL ON ENDING POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. WE WILL GO THROUGH THE YOUR ORDER THAT IS AS IT APPEARS WITHIN THE AGENDA AND WE HAVE FIVE DISTINGUISHED PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL TODAY WE WILL BEGIN WITH DR DAVID GRETZKY PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY SENIOR ADVISER FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM. AND FOUNDER OF THE END OF POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA EPIC. THIRD DOCTOR W'KABI SEAN PEDIATRICIAN AND ACTING SURGEON GENERAL. FOURTH DIRECTOR TIM JOHNSON FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND FINALLY SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. L. WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS ON THE PANEL UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED LET US BEGIN WITH DR DAVID CRUSTY WELCOME AND PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. I'M HONORED TO HAVE BEEN INVITED BY THE CHAIR TO MAKE A PRESENTATION TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE OKAY I'LL GET RIGHT TO IT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT THAT I RECENTLY CO AUTHORED IS TO LAY OUT A LONG RUN PLANNED FOR BUILDING A JUST INCLUSIVE AND POVERTY PRETTY CULTIVATE. BECAUSE THE TASK COMPLETELY ELIMINATING POVERTY CAN SEEM DAUNTING WE WANTED TO DESCRIBE IN STEP BY STEP BLUEPRINT FOR. EXACTLY HOW WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN. THE BLUEPRINT COMES IN TWO PARTS. FIRST PARK RECOGNIZES THAT IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT ELIMINATING POVERTY WE CAN'T BANK EXCLUSIVELY ON THE SAFETY NET TO GET THAT JOB DONE. INSTEAD NEED TO BEGIN BY FIXING THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GENERATING SO MUCH POVERTY IN THE FIRST PLACE. INSTITUTIONAL WORK IS PRE DISTRIBUTED BECAUSE IT PREVENTS POVERTY FROM HAPPENING. AND THUS REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF AFTER THE FACT REMEDIATION THAT THE SAFETY NET HAS TO TAKE ON. THE BLUEPRINT DESCRIBES FOR STARTING POINT REFORMS WITHIN KEY INEQUALITY GENERATING INSTITUTIONS. NUMBER ONE WE SHOW THAT OUR LABOR MARKETS NEED TO BE REBUILT BY BREAKING DOWN LABOR SUPPLY BARRIERS EQUALIZING ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND EMPOWERING AND PROTECTING WORKERS. NUMBER TWO WE SHOW THAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE REBUILT BY DECRIMINALIZING QUALITY OF LIFE OF FENCES ENDING PRACTICES THAT TARGET PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PROVIDING MEANINGFUL SECOND CHANCES. NUMBER THREE WE SHOULD OUR WEALTH GENERATING INSTITUTIONS NEED TO BE REBUILT BY INCREASING ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP OPENING UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGULATING PREDATORY FINANCIAL SERVICES. AND FINALLY NUMBER FOUR WE SHOWED THAT THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS TO BE INCREASED BUT BEFORE MEANS OPENING AND INCENTIVIZING IN FUNDING DEVELOPMENT STREAMLINING BUILDING APPROVALS AND ENFORCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING TARGETS. THIS FIRST ROUND TO PRE DISTRIBUTIONAL WORK WHICH IS DESCRIBED OF COURSE IN MUCH MORE DETAIL IN THE REPORT ITSELF. BEST TARGETS THE UPSTREAM SOURCES OF POVERTY AND INEQUITY BLUEPRINT PROCEEDS FROM THE RECOGNITION THAT THESE PRE DISTRIBUTION REFORMS AS IMPORTANT AS THEY ARE WILL ALWAYS BE INCOMPLETE. EVEN IF THEY WERE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND HAD PRECISELY THE INTENDED EFFECTS THEY WOULDN'T ROAD OUT OLD IN EQUITIES BUILT INTO OUR INSTITUTIONS. IF THE JOB OF OUR SAFETY NET THE SACRED TO ALL OF OUR SAFETY NET TO PICK UP THE PIECES. AND HANDLE THESE RESIDUAL DESIGN FAILURES THAT'S A BIG JOB AND THERE WILL INEVITABLY THE SHORTFALLS WHEN SO MUCH IS ASKED TO THE SAFETY NET. DO THEN NOW TURNS RESEARCH OF KEY SAFE NET REFORMS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SHORTFALL. FOR WHICH I'LL MENTION. NUMBER ONE. WE NEED TO BETTER SUPPORT OVERLOOKED POPULATIONS BUT CURRENTLY AREN'T ELIGIBLE. FOR ALL THE SAFETY NET BENEFITS THEY NEED. NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO REDUCE HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS BY BOLSTERING SUPPORT FOR HOUSING IN SECURE HOUSEHOLDS. NUMBER THREE WE NEED TO SET UP DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEMS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO COORDINATE THE DELIVERY OF EXISTING SAFETY NET BENEFITS. AND NUMBER FOUR WE NEED TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO SECURING SUPPORT AND END STATE INTERCEPTION OF DEATH THE PREVENTATIVE FROM GETTING THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. WE WILL OUTLINE TO NEW PROGRAMS GUARANTEED INCOME AND BABY BONDS THAT ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT COULD NOT BE FULLY HANDLED VIA THESE FORMS A LOAN. THESE TWO PROGRAMS ESTABLISHING INCOME AND WEALTH FLOORS WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR ECONOMY- THERE'S MUCH RESEARCH SHOWING THAT CASH TRANSFERS WORK. WE NEED TO FURTHER EXPERIMENTALLY THIS PARTICULAR TYPES OF TRANSFER PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY COORDINATE WELL WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS. THE IMMEDIATE PROPOSAL THEREFORE IS NOT JUST REFORM EXISTING SAFETY NET PROGRAMS BUT ALSO TO SUPPORT ONGOING EXPERIMENTATION WITH TWO NEW PROGRAMS. SO WHY IT MIGHT BE ASKED WE NEED TO EXPERIMENT WITH GUARANTEED INCOME AND THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE GIVEN FEDERALLY MANDATED ELIGIBILITY RULES WITHIN EXISTING SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. WILL LIKELY BE IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE LIMON A PARTY WITHOUT A GUARANTEED INCOME SUPPLEMENT. THE CLOSES GAPS IN COVERAGE. THE SECOND PROBE. A BABY BONDS PROGRAM THE PARALLEL MINIMUM WEALTH FOR IT TAKES ON THE MASSIVE INEQUALITIES OF OPPORTUNITY GENERATED BY THE STATE'S WELCOME WELL BODIES OPPORTUNITY SOME OF OUR CHILDREN GREW UP IN A WORLD RICH WITH OPPORTUNITY WHILE OTHERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO REALIZE THEIR DREAMS. IT BABY BONDS WERE ESTABLISHED OVERSTREET'S CHILDREN WOULD HAVE GUARANTEED ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS OF GOING TO COLLEGE STARTING A BUSINESS OR CONTRIBUTING IN OTHER WAYS. THE CORE IDEAS THIS IS A DYNAMIC SYSTEM IN WHICH PRE DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION WORK HAND IN HAND. IT PRE DISTRIBUTION REFORMS BLUEBIRD IN EXCESS OF OUR EXPECTATIONS. WE CAN SIMPLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REDISTRIBUTION IF THEY FAIL TO DELIVER WE CAN BE THE AUTOMATIC STABILIZER OF REDISTRIBUTION BILLION WHAT. THE UPSHOT WE CAN INDEED COMPLETELY ELIMINATE RP THROUGH DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT BETWEEN PERCENT UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM REMEDIATION. I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MICHAEL TUBBS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU DR GRANT'S GAME MY NAME IS MICHAEL TO HELP THEM FORMER MAYOR CITY OF STOCKTON. I'M CURRENTLY SPECIAL ADVISER TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM ON ECONOMIC MOBILITY OPPORTUNITY FROM ACCOUNTS OF THE PERFORMER TEACHER BUT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS DISCUSSION- A YOUNG PERSON LIKE UNFORTUNATELY MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE- IS THAT CALIFORNIA WHO GREW UP IN POVERTY. AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TESTIFIED IT SPEAKING- AS A FORMER ELECTED US ON WITH ACCESS TO AGENCY AND WITH SOME POLICY KNOWLEDGE BUT I'M ALSO DEEPLY SAD THAT BECAUSE THERE'S FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH I'M AT THE SCHOOL WHERE I PLAYED BASKETBALL WITH BY. SIX SWIMMING CLASSES WITH WHO WHO AREN'T HERE WHO WHO WHO DIDN'T WEREN'T ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE TOO MANY HOME DIDN'T MAKE IT TO TWENTY FIVE WITH THE UNDERLYING A PRETTY BUSY CONDITION BEING THAT POVERTY IN POVERTY AS YOU POINT OUT MR CHAIRMAN THAT'S BEEN PERVASIVE IN IN OUR STATE. AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS BUDGET ARM IT WITH THE BUDGET SURPLUS WE TALK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT THAT THE SURPLUS IS BECAUSE SOME FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE DONE INCREDIBLY WELL DURING A TIME A MASS EFFORT. DURING A TIME OF THE MILLIONS OF WOMEN LEAVING THE WORK FORCE COULD BECOME A CHILD CARE ISSUES- HAVE DONE WELL TIME WHEN MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND IN THEIR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THAT THOSE WHO HAD A LOT OF MONEY AT EVEN MORE LIKELY AND THOSE TO START OFF BEHIND ARE EVEN FURTHER BEHIND AS WE PERSIST YOU THIS PANDEMIC AND THAT'S WHY THE. TOPIC OF THIS- COMMITTEE. THAT'S WHY. SERVE THE WORK WE'RE ALL CONNECT. CAN ARSON TO THE ENTIRE NOT. THERE ARE SAY IS NOW. FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO BE THE GO TO. ALL RIGHT THIS CAR MISTER CHAIRMAN I WAS IN IN. BUT THE FOR WITH MY NAME. I'M WITH HER GROW SON I. WAS GOING TO LAW OFF THE LOG ON TO THIS SHE SAID MAN I AM EXCITED ABOUT THAT POVERTY STAFF YOU'RE DOING.

WE ALL KNOW THE STATS WE ARE THOUGH THAT CALIFORNIA THE GOLDEN STATE HAS THE FIFTH LARGEST GDP IN THE WORLD. WE ALL KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA THE GOLDEN STATE HAS MORE BILLIONAIRES THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD BESIDES THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. WE KNOW THE FACTS WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE. IT'S ALSO THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN AND IN POVERTY WE SEE THE ISSUES WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WE SEE THE WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO. IT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSED BUDGET CAST A BOLD VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE STATE INCLUDING TWENTY TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IN INVESTMENTS IN HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY. TO ENSURE HEALTH COVERAGE FOR EVERY CALIFORNIAN REGARDING IMMIGRATION STATUS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ALSO A GREAT PARTY GIVES INVESTORS INCLUDE INCLUDING EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT.

TO CREATE BACK ON PO THERE CHAIRMAN THE ENTIRE SET KNOWS THAT WE TO LOOK AT HOW WE BILL BACK BETTER THE STATE THROUGH THE WITH. IN THE OP. BEFORE IT. IS EMAIL. BECAUSE IF WE SAW POWER IN. WE CREATE A- FOR THE RED OF THE COULD THE- WE KNOW THAT HOW. OFTEN THE COUNTRY'S GROUND FOR A BIG POWER THAT THAT THAT THAT THE CO LOOKS TO ENACT IN THIS MOMENT WORK HALTED A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN DO MORE IF IT WAS REALLY GRAPPLE WITH THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE POVERTY. WE SHOULD TOLERATE PARTY WE SHOULD OF WORK AROUND PARTY WE HAVE THE END IT IS NOT CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT BIG PART OF ENDING POVERTY ISN'T JUST AN POLICY IT'S AN UNDERSTANDING A COUPLE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH. TRUTH NUMBER ONE THE ISSUE IS THAT WITH PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY THAT THE PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM THAT THE PROSTHESES THAT THE POLICIES THAT THE STRUCTURES THAT THE WAGES THE LACK OF THE LACK OF BARGAINING IN BAD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT TERRIBLE SCHOOLS THAT THE UNSAFE NEIGHBORHOOD THE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS- BUILDS. THOSE ARE THE ISSUE. NOT THE PEOPLE IN NUMBER TO OUR PROGRAMS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED WITH GETTING AS MUCH PEOPLE IN THAT'S POSSIBLE AND NOT FROM EXCLUSIONARY LEADS WE SHOULD WHAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO QUALIFIES FOR BENEFITS. IN CALIFORNIA TO EASILY ACCESS THOSE BENEFITS IN FACT THERE IS THIS A REPORT FROM USC THAT'S SPOKE TO THE FACT THAT THE FOLKS ACTUALLY. WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THE BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO HAVE A WEDDING COUPLE SUB AND BURDENSOME AND DIGNITY STRIPPING IN THE HUMANIZING. THEY WILL HAVE A HUGE. DENT IN POVERTY. THEY GET PROFESSOR GRABS THE- REALLY LAID OUT FROM FROM A WHAT SHE BE DONE. AND I THINK I'M TO THE CHALLENGE AS TO MY WITH THE- WILL PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THAT ONE PERSON. WHO WORKS ON HARVEY ISSUES FULL TIME. WHO'S ACTUALLY IN POVERTY. I HAVE A WIDE. WHO WHO ADVOCATES ORGANIZES AROUND HARVEY ISSUES. THAT ARE IN POVERTY IT I THINK WHAT'S GOOD FOR US IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE SO WE GET MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME IN CALIFORNIA IT'S TIME TO BE TRUE TO WHAT WE SEE ON PAPER IT'S TIME TO LIVE UP TO OUR VALUES IS TRYING TO TRULY BE A GOLDEN STATE. GOLDEN STATE FOR ALL OF GOLDEN STATE FOR EVERYONE THE STATE WORK FOR EDWARD EVERYONE HAS OPPORTUNITY WHEN THE POLICIES ARE CHEST WHEN THE SYSTEMS. ARE CREATED AND THAT TOO. CREATE THIS FUNDS. BUT IT'S REALLY TO WE KNOW WE SHARE THAT ALL HE HAVE BEEN HERE DICK. AT ALL PEOPLE HAVEN'T VALUE AND ALL PEOPLE HAVE INHERENT WORTH AND NOT THE VERY LEAST SAID NOT LIVE IN MISERY SO NOT LIVE IN A LACKS TO NOT LIVE IN POVERTY. IN THE STATE WITH SUCH IMMENSE ABOUT DATES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DOCTOR TO BE COUPLE SEAN WHO IS THE ACTING SURGEON GENERAL. FOR THE STATE ACCOUNTABLE CALIFORNIA PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR DAVID COMPLETION. I'M A PEDIATRICIAN CHIEF HEALTH OFFICER AND ACTING CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL IT'S A TRUE PLEASURE TO JOIN THIS PANEL TODAY TO DISCUSS THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF EARLY LIFE STRESS AND PROPERTY. ADDING TO THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AS MANY AS A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS LIVES IN POVERTY OR IN NEAR POVERTY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE AS FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AS THIS PANEL WILL KNOW WELL. SINCE THEN COBIT NINETEEN IS ONLY LIKELY TO HAVE INCREASED POVERTY AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT STRESSORS AND INEQUITIES. IN THIS WILL FURTHER SEPARATE AT THE TO CALIFORNIA'S THE CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA MENTIONED. THE SCIENCE TELLS US THAT EARLY AND PROLONGED STRESS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LIFE ON HEALTH. WE KNOW THIS IN PART BECAUSE OF THE LANDMARK BURKE MY CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY THAT WAS LED BY THE CDC AND BY KAISER PERMANENTE A- IN THAT WORK THE DEFINED TEN EXPERIENCES. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR ACES WHICH INCLUDED CHILD ABUSE CHILD NEGLECT AND GROWING UP WITH A CHALLENGE SUCH AS SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD FACING INCARCERATION WERE UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. HE SAYS ARE EXTREMELY COMMON THE MAJORITY OF US MORE THAN SIX IN TEN CALIFORNIANS WILL HAVE EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE ACE BY AGE EIGHTEEN. AND ONE IN SIX OF US WILL BE EXPERIENCED. FOUR OR MORE ACES. AND WHEN A SAYS A WITHOUT STIFF PROTECTIVE FACTORS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SUPPORTED CARE GIVING. A WHOLE SET OF BIOLOGICAL CHANGES CAN GET SET INTO MOTION CALLED THE TOXIC STRESS RESPONSE. TOXIC STRESS DESCRIBES ALTERATIONS IN BRAIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION IN HORMONAL REGULATION IN METABOLIC PROCESS SEES IN THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND IN THE WAY THAT CELLS IN BODIES AGE. THESE BIOLOGICAL CHANGES CAN BECOME INCLUDED INTO THE WAY THAT OUR GENES ARE READ AND EVEN PASSED DOWN FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT. SO HE SAYS IN THE RESULTING TOXIC STRESS RESPONSE THAT CAN OCCUR OR A ROOT CAUSE TOO MANY OF THE MOST COMMON SERIOUS AND COSTLY HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TODAY. THIS INCLUDES NINE OUT OF TEN OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH NATIONALLY. SUCH AS HEART DISEASE CANCER DIABETES AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN LIFE EXPECTANCY AND HEALTH CARE COSTS. SO WHILE POVERTY WAS NOT ONE OF THE ORIGINAL TEN PIECES POVERTY IS CERTAINLY A PROFOUND DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND IT'S A RISK FACTOR BOTH FOR PIECES OCCURRING AND INDEPENDENTLY FOR TOXIC STRESS AS WELL. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CASES AFFECTING ALL COMMUNITIES WE DO KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES SOME POPULATIONS ARE AFFECTED DISPROPORTIONATELY. BREAK FOR INSTANCE FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN POVERTY ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HE SAYS AND OTHER ADVERSITIES IN ADDITION TO BEING LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE KINDS OF RESOURCES NEEDED TO REALLY PREVENT THOSE ACES FROM LEADING TO TOXIC STRESS. SO POVERTY CAN NOT ONLY AMPLIFY THE IMPACT OF BASIS BUT HE SAYS MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT A PERSON WILL SUFFER FROM CHALLENGES LIKE POVERTY HOMELESSNESS AND INCARCERATION. WE ALSO KNOW THAT POVERTY CAN INDUCE SIGNIFICANT STRESS ON A DAILY BASIS AND CAN LEAD THEIR BY TO THE TOXIC STRESS RESPONSE IN AND OF ITSELF TOXIC STRESS RESPONSE IN PLACE WE CAN ACTUALLY TREAT IT AS A HEALTH CONDITION. AND SEVEN SUPPORTED THE S. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA LAUNCHED THE PIECES AWARENESS SHOULD OF THROUGH WHICH CLINICIANS WILL RECEIVE TRAINING CLINICAL TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS AND REIMBURSEMENT TO SCREEN FOR AND TREAT. TOXIC STRESS THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH EAST AS- THE TREATMENTS THAT WE RECOMMEND BETTER EVIDENCE BASED INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ENHANCING SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIPS HIGH QUALITY SLEEP SLEEP. ANTI INFLAMMATORY NUTRITION EXERCISE MINDFULNESS PRACTICES EXPERIENCES IN NATURE AND WHEN NEEDED AND TO HEALTH CARE. SO FAR THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND MORE THAN HALF A MILLION MEDI CAL PATIENTS HAVE BEEN SCREENED FOR HE SAYS. THE ACES EQUITY ACT WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT EARLIER THIS YEAR HAS ALSO NOW SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED COVERAGE FOR EAST GREETING TO ALL PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. OUR COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS POSITION US TO CONTINUE REDUCING THE IMPACT OF EARLY ADVERSITY AND TOXIC STRESS IN FUNDAMENTAL WAYS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK TO POSITIVELY TRANSFORM LIVES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DIRECTOR TIM JOHNSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES DIRECTOR. THANK YOU CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON KIM JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND GLAD TO BE ON THIS DISTINGUISHED PANEL THIS AFTERNOON. THE COMMITTEES ASKED ABOUT THE PRIORITIES OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ON ENDING POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA AND CRITICAL NEAR TERM STEPS THAT MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED TO DO SO. I WANT JUST SAY HERE WISH SO MUCH THAT WE DO AND ACT TOGETHER ESPECIALLY WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED AND HISTORIC INVESTMENTS AT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE I JUST IN THIS PAST YEAR THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATIONALIZED ALTERNATELY. WE ARE WORKING TO ACHIEVE A CALIFORNIA WHERE RACE ETHNICITY GENDER IDENTITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND OTHER FORMS OF SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION NO LONGER PREDICT A PERSON'S FOR COMMUNITIES HEALTH AND LIFE OUTCOMES YOU JUST HEARD A LOT ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND REALLY ENSURING THAT HOUSING AND FOOD SECURITY WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. DR DISEASE AND WORSEN HEALTH AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY SO HOW WE ARE FOCUSED. ON ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE REDUCING HOMELESSNESS ESPECIALLY CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS BY FOCUSING ON THE HOUSING FIRST STRATEGY AND BUILDING UP PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND THE SUPPORT SERVICES NEEDED BY THOSE WE HOUSING SUPPORT INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AS A PATH OUT OF POVERTY AGAIN A SPACE WHERE JUSTIN THIS PAST YEAR OVER TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. I WAS. INVESTED TO SUPPORT THIS GOAL. OFF THE RECORD. AND UTILIZE MANY HOW A TOOL HELP YOU MANY THE COMP CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA'S MOST MOBILE RESIDENTS INCLUDING THE HOMELESS. THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND THOSE WHO ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED IN THE GROWING AGING POPULATION. THERE'S ALSO A STRATEGIC PRIORITY AROUND STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S SAFETY NET TO DISTRACT THE INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES THAT FUEL THE PANDEMIC IN ORDER TO LIFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. AND CREATE ECONOMIC SELF SUFFICIENCY AND THE SPACE THERE ARE PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUCH AS THAT. MAXIM A PAYMENT INCREASE THINK HOW WORKS OF SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT. ACTUALLY I WOULD ACTUALLY OPERATIONALIZE IN MORE IN THAT SPACE. I WE ALSO OF COURSE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR PROGRAMS THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW SYSTEM OR CAL OR WERE ABLE TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHAT IS WORKING. IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM DESIGN AND RESOURCES THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD. WE ALSO HAVE A STRATEGIC PRIORITY AROUND THE PEOPLE NEW AND INNOVATIVE PATHS TO TRAIN AND HIRE CULTURALLY COMPETENT WORKERS TO MEET THE FULL DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEEDS AND AGAIN. THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSES A ONE TIME ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OVER THREE YEARS IN THE CARICOM YOU WORK FORCE I BY BOTH THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THAT'S TRUE. NOT ONLY OF THE STRATEGY OF THE DELIVERY COMPONENTS OF OUR SAFETY NET BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN OUR PROGRAMS HAVE CAREER PATHWAYS. THAT CAN SUPPORT THEM. TO MEET THEIR GOALS. A LOT THERE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE AT THE FEW THAT FOR QUESTION. BUT WILL ON TO SAY QUESTION WAS WHAT ARE THE DID. OF THOSE. AND CORE SOCIAL NET. AND WHAT THIS MEAN TOWARDS OUR APPROACH TOWARDS EQUITY AND EQUITY. I CAN HELP WORKS I WOULD NOTE THAT- 79% OF THE COW WORKS ACT HE SLOWED OUR POPULATION BEING SERVED OUR CHILDREN THEIR CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN. AND CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF. THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION WHO PASS A SAFETY NET THAT CONTINUES THE CASH ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. FOR FAMILIES EXPERIENCING PROPERTY A PROPERTY FOR THE CHILD EVEN. IF THE PARENT IS NOT PARTICIPATING GIVEN THAT STABILITY TO THE FAMILY. NEARLY 90% OF THE OVERALL EXPLODING CAL WORKS IS FEMALE. I WOULD ALSO HAVE 31% OF THE CASELOAD SPEAKING AT AND AT FIRST LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. IN CALFRESH I WOULD NOTE THAT NEARLY 39% OF THE OVERALL FOUR POINT SIX INDIVIDUALS SERVED OUR CHILDREN. AT OVER TWO MILLION ARE AGES EIGHTEEN TO FIFTY NINE. I AM JUST A HUNDRED MILLION ARE OVER SIXTY. WE ALSO SEE A TWENTY SIX POINT 5% OF THAT CASELOAD AT. SPEAKING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AS AN EXAMPLE. SO JUST IF YOU'VE BEEN A GRAPHICS STATISTICS BEAR I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IN OUR HOUSING PROGRAMS THAT ARE HOMELESS PROGRAMS DISPARITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY EXISTS THERE. AGAIN ESPECIALLY. FOR A LOT OF OUR- THESE INDIVIDUALS COLOR. I AM INTO THE MEASURE WHAT THE PANEL RT SPOKE INTO TOO SO I TERMS THAT EQUITY. I HOW WE LOOK AT INFORMATION AND IN. OUR TOP AND THAT IT IT'S LIKE RECOGNIZE DAM FOR CARE AND- MAKING THAT ACT. TO BEGIN HIGH CHILDCARE AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES AS IT IS AS ROBUST AS IT CAN BE. A LOOKING AT DEVELOPING OUT WHICH WE DID TOGETHER AT THE CAL WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE H. DRANK THE BASED APPROACH TO CONNECTING. OUR FAMILIES EXPERIENCING CAR TO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO. ARE LOOKING AT KOKORIN STRATEGIES IN OUR TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS LOOKING AT LANGUAGE ACCESS IN TERMS OF. OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND MORE AND HOW WE ARE REACHING OUT PROGRAM SO AGAIN. ALL OF OUR POLICIES I WILL NOTE THAT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SPECIFICALLY AT TWO YEARS AGO NOW WE ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF EQUITY TO REALLY ENSURE THAT. OUR TEAM OUR STAFF HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT OUR POLICIES THROUGH A RACIAL EQUITY TRAIN AND LANDS. ARE IN THERE BUT THERE BY CONTINUE TO PROPOSED POLICIES THINGS LIKE OUR OUR WORK ON AT SUPPORTING IT CAN TO CONTINUITY FOR FAMILIES CONNECTED TO CAL WORKS EVEN MAYBE WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING TO GET. BY WITH THEIR CHILD AND THEIR MANY OTHER EXAMPLES THAT I CAN GIVE THAT SPACE BUT I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY. THE DATA IS KEY ABOUT WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR DATA TO SEE WHO WE ARE SERVING HOW THEY ARE DOING AND WHY. AND WHO ARE WE ARE SERVING- AND HOW WE CAN MEET BETTER REACH THOSE POPULATIONS WHICH BRINGS ME TO YOUR NEXT QUESTION ON THE AGENDA. AROUND HOW CAN BE BETTER FASTER POPULATIONS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. I'LL JUST NOTE NOTE IN TERMS OF AGAIN THE CAN. XIN WE HAVE A SAFETY NET THAT HAS MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. I WITHIN IT REALLY LOOKING AT NOT ONLY CASH SUPPORTS THE FOOD SUPPORTS THE HOUSING SUPPORTS THE HEALTH. SUPPORTS BUT HOW THESE TIED TOGETHER IN THE WHOLE PERSON AND THAT PERSON CENTERED. APPROACH TO WHAT WE'RE DOING. I WE CAN SIR LEARN A LOT INTO OF OUR EVERY STRATEGY. ARE AND YEAH AND AT A CERTAIN. FROM IN CALFRESH HOW MAKE SENSE TO THE S. I SS KEEP. HOW WE TARGETED INTENTIONAL FACT DIFFERENT MODES SCHOOL. SUPPORTS I WOULD DO IN THE SPACE OF. STUDENTS WHICH WOULD FEEL MORE ABOUT. THAT LATER IN YOUR- THIS AFTERNOON. IT'S HOW WORK WE HAVE IN OUR BALANCE. ACT THROUGH. OUT BOTH AGAIN LET'S JUST. IN THE- AT SUPPORT INVEST AROUND HOW WORKS OUT REGIONALLY. LONG A K. WORKS THEY- STATEWIDE ADVISED COUNTY. AGAIN WORK LOOKING TO BUILD ON THIS. THAT HAVE WORKED IN THE CALFRESH SPACE BUT AGAIN. I DEFINE HOW WE CAN CONNECT TO THE FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES AND AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE LANGUAGE ACCESS AND TARGETED. AND FOCUSED OUTREACH TO POPULATIONS WHO WE KNOW ARE ELIGIBLE AND NOT BEING SERVED. AND THEN FINALLY YOU HAVE A QUESTION RELATED TO AT THE GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT PROGRAM WE ARE THRILLED. TO BE LAUNCHING THIS INITIATIVE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. OVER FIVE YEARS ELIGIBLE INTO T. TO. HIGH PROGRAM THAT FOR THAT TEETH IN TO PER. WILL BE PRIORITIZING FUNDING FOR PILOT PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS THAT SERVE. AT CALIFORNIANS WHO AGE OUT OF AT THE FOSTER PROGRAM. AT OR AFTER AGE TWENTY ONE AND- OR WHO ARE PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS. I WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED WITH MANY ADULTS ON THIS PANEL AND OTHERWISE AND WITH MANY MANY STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP EMPLOYEES WHO WANT TO BUILD ON THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE TO DATE IN THE SPACE AND- LESSONS LEARNED. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE PRIORITY POPULATIONS THAT I JUST MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THE DESIGN AND THE RESOURCES AND CONNECTIONS THAT WOULD MOST BENEFIT THEM. AT TO REACH THEIR GOALS SO THAT HAS BEEN THAT THERE AT BOTH. OF OUR WORK OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. THE CHEST AND- AB RELEASED OUR- OUR OUR- FOR IN ABOUT. IN WILL BE. THAT SPACE AND I FINALLY AT THIS WEEK WE WILL BE RELEASING A PLANNING DOCUMENT TO HELP OUR PERSPECTIVE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS PREPARE. FOR THAT FINAL REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS WORK TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PILOT. I WHICH WILL BE RELEASED IN LATE SPRING. AND I WORK WITH THERE THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. L. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA MEMBERS AS SUNNY PEDIG WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PREPARED REMARKS BETTER HERE TO- TAKE NOTE OF ANY. SPECIAL REQUESTS OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAIRED TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION I FIRST WANNA THANK DR- CRUSTY FOR THE ENDING POVERTY BLUEPRINT- IF NO ONE HAS READ IT IS LINKED TO THE AGENDA AND I'M HAPPY- TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE. TAKING A LOOK AT IT BUT WANTED TO DIG INTO SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS THAT YOU ARE MOVING TOWARDS. AS I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO WHAT YOU SAID DURING YOUR TESTIMONY THAT WE CAN'T BANK EXCLUSIVELY ON THE SAFETY NET. AND THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO THE INSTITUTIONAL WORK THAT IS PRE THIS TRIBUTE ED THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEMS AND SPECIFICALLY. HOW THOSE SYSTEMS CAN ASSIST US IN ENSURING THAT PEOPLE ARE- AND ROLLED INTO PROGRAMS THAT THEY SHOULD BE APPLICABLE TO SINCE IT SEEMS THAT WE AS A GOVERNMENT HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THOSE SYSTEMS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ENROLLING INTO PROGRAMS AND WONDERING HOW YOU CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US TO INTEGRATE AND ALLOW THOSE POSTS PROGRAMS TO ASSIST. US TO EXTEND AS WELL. DR EMULATING DR GRETZKY HAD TO LEAVE TO TEACH A CLASS HE LEFT A MESSAGE IN THE CHAT THAT UN FORTUNATELY HAD TO LEAVE THE PANEL. WITH THAT I WILL FOLLOW UP AS- I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY THEN TURN THE QUESTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION- THE CLAIM THAT WE HAVE FROM HIM IS THAT OUR CURRENT DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEMS DO NOT ALLOW US TO APPROPRIATELY DO CRISIS DETECTION PROBLEMS AS WELL AS LEGACY MICRO SIMULATION MODELING. AND AS I WAS STATING EARLIER AT THE COURT OF APPLICATIONS I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INTEGRATE THESE DATA SYSTEMS TO BETTER ALLOW US TO STREAMLINE THE APPLICATION SYSTEMS TO THE US REDUCE BARRIERS AND ENROLLMENT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND FOLLOW UP WITH DOCTOR CRASKE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACTUALIZE SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS INTO CHANGES WE MAKE GOING FORWARD I'M HOPING TO HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION COMMENT ON THAT IF POSSIBLE. SURE JOHNSON AT THE PROPOSAL SERVICES I WILL JUST THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE OTHER STRATEGIC PRIORITIES I DIDN'T MENTION JUST IN TERMS OF BEING BRIEF IT'S CERTAINLY A FOCUS OF OURS WITH A CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH MANY MANY PARTNERS SO WE'D BE GLAD TO AT ITS BEST THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS REPORT. I WORK WITH DOCTOR DOCTOR RESCUE MATTERS AT TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS. I'D LIKE NOW FOLLOW UP WITH. MAYOR TUBBS OF FIVE COULD AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY. CHANGES THAT YOU CAN RECOMMEND TO US FOR THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT ARE COVERED UNDER. TODAY'S AGENDA AND FOR CAL WORK SPECIFICALLY. EFFORTS TO SHIFT THE CULTURE IN THE PROGRAM AWAY FROM WORK FOR FOCUSED TOWARDS BARRIER REMOVAL. CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT MATERNAL HEALTH AND FAMILY STABILIZATION. BUT I'M WONDERING WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO TO FURTHER FACILITATE THIS CHANGE IN OUR FAMILY STABILIZATION PROGRAM. AND WHERE WE SEE SO MUCH STIGMA AND SO MUCH DESTITUTION STILL EXIST. I'M HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT MAYOR TOPS. YEAH YOU MISTER CHAIR AND APPRECIATE BOTH THE WORK THAT'S BEEN ONGOING DIRECTOR JOHNSON INTO QUESTION YOU POSED AROUND SERVICE AND THE COORDINATION OTHER THINGS ANYTHING TO DO BETTER- MEET MISTER CHAIR IN TERMS OF. YOUR QUESTION I THINK WE HAVE TO AGAIN REALLY DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS IDEA THAT. IT'S NOT LIKE IF PEOPLE ARE WORKING IS BECAUSE THERE'S BARRIERS TO WORK OUTSIDE OF DESIRE I THINK SO MANY OF THE WAYS THIS COMES FROM SORT OF MY GRANDMOTHER SPENDING HER TIME AT THE CONGRESS AS BOTH THE OFFICER. IN SAN JOAQUINCOUNTY FOR TWENTY YEARS AND SO MUCH OF. THE ORIENTATION WAS AROUND THANK FORCING PEOPLE TO WORK WITH I THINK THIS THIS FOCUS ON LIKE LET'S REMOVE BARRIERS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO WORK. IS THAT RIGHT ONCE THE REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT IN WE HAVE TO GET RID OF WORK REQUIREMENTS AND I KNOW THAT SEEMS RADICAL I KNOW THAT SUBSTANCE IN TWO DIFFERENT PARADIGM SHIFT BUT BUT I'LL KNOW. TO YOUR POINT TO THE POINT IS CONVENING THAT WERE IN A MOMENT WHERE WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE IMAGINATIVE IN OUR THINKING AND REALLY PUSH BACK. ON DEC BAY HELD SACROSANCT THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ACTUAL OUTCOMES ARE NOTHING DO WITH SERVICE DELIVERY AND I REALLY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH DEEPLY HELD AND INGRAINED BELIEFS ABOUT WHY PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN IN IN IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS I THINK. CANCER QUESTIONS ARE CLEARLY MISTER CHARMING GETTING RID OF WORK REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE- SORT OF THE THAT THE NORTH THE NORTH STAR AND ALSO. CONNECTING TO TWO OTHER SUPPORTS I THINK DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND- PROFESSOR GRETZKY MENTIONED THAT THERE'S OVERLAP THAT VERY RARELY WILL YOU FIND. ONE PERSON WHO JUST QUALIFIED FOR ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS BUT THEY QUALIFY FOR A BUNCH OTHER PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE ONLY ABLE TO ACCESS A COUPLE OF PERHAPS THE QUALIFY FOR. SOME RELIEF BEGIN LEGALISTIC WEEK ABOUT OUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT OUR CITIZENS. AND THAT SOMEONE NEEDS THAT THAT YOU SUPPORT THE PROBLEM HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING. BORDER PEPPERONI CHARGES SUPPORT NINETY CREATORS WAY AT MAKE IT EASY. FOR FOLKS AT THEIR- SO THAT THEY CAN GET ON THE PATH. THIS THAT. BUT HARD. TO GET ON THE PATH OF THE- WHEN DON'T WANT TO FLOOR. THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STAND A THIS DIDN'T CRASHED INK. IN GAPS. I WILL EXPOUND. WHAT YOU DO SAID ABOUT HOW WE- USED. TO HELP TO PREVENT JUST TO REALLY MAKES I. MAKE THE TWO WE AS A- STATE ARE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO DO INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION SYSTEM MATCHES FOR THOSE WHO ARE ON TO CAL WORKS CALFRESH AND MEDI CAL. BUT WE DON'T TURN AROUND AND SAY IF THEIR INCOME WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT THEY WOULD THEN QUALIFY FOR A. B. AND C. AND I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE TURN THOSE PROGRAMS TO HELP US TO ASSIST PEOPLE. TO SECURE THE BENEFITS WE WILL MOVE A BIG STEP FORWARD TO ENDING POVERTY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR US TO LEAVE THE CONVERSATION TODAY WITH. IS THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE THERE TO HELP. THOSE WHO CALL THIS STATE HOME SECURE RESOURCES RATHER THAN TO PREVENT AND HINDER- THOSE WHO ARE. WHO ARE ASKING FOR HELP IN WHO NEED THE HELP. RIGHT NOW. WITH THAT. I DO FEEL OBLIGATED TO HIGHLIGHT AND UPLIFT MUCH OF THE WORK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE TO SUPPORT OVERLOOKED POPULATIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS HEALTHCARE WAS MENTIONED AND MEDICAL EXPANSION TO ALL IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FOR US TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN MEAN POVERTY DRIVER FOR MANY WITHIN OUR LATINO POPULATIONS BUT ALSO WANTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK THAT IS GOING ON WITHIN THE PATH FOR THE JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS WHO ARE. NEEDING A REAL SECOND CHANCE TO- COME BACK INTO SOCIETY AFTER BEING JAILED AS EXAMPLES OF HOW WE ARE HELPING TO SUPPORT OVERLOOKED POPULATIONS I KNOW THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK FOR US TO DO- I DON'T. WANTS TO END THIS CONVERSATION HERE TODAY AS I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR US TO HAVE. BUT WILL POINT TO THE FACT THAT THE SPEAKER HAS JUST BEGUN THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON POVERTY AND ON ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND WILL MOVE MUCH OF THIS CONVERSATION INTO THAT SELECT COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL ONE AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL TO. MOVING ON TO ISSUE TOO TODAY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND OVERSIGHT OVER KEY PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS AND CAL WORKS. WE WILL HAVE EIGHT PRESENTERS ON PANEL TWO. WE WILL BEGIN WITH JENNIFER HERNANDEZ FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT DIVISION DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WE WILL THEN HAVE CRISTINA MESSA CAL WORKS AND FAMILY RESILIENCE BRANCH CHIEF FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. JANINE DR FINANCIAL BUDGET ANALYST FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE L. A. RO. JAMAICA GASKINS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF GRACE AND CHILD POVERTY CALIFORNIA. JENNIFER BRETT B. THE LEAD CHAPTER ORGANIZER FOR PARENTS VOICES CALIFORNIA MIKE HERALDS THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND KATHY CENTRELINE MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. LET'S BEGIN WITH DEPUTY DIRECTOR HERNANDEZ WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE THIS IS ACTUALLY CRISTINA MESSA WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AT YOU FOR THE PRODUCTS AND END THE RESILIENCE FRENCH AND I WILL BE KICKING US OFF THIS AFTERNOON. I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US AS STARTING FIRST WITH ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS THAT YOU POSED AROUND HOW THE ADMINISTRATION SEEMS A ROLL CALL WORKS IN ITS OVERALL ANTI POVERTY STRATEGY. SO AT THE BED THE PRIMARY CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES EXPERIENCING POVERTY AT CAL WORKS PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ENSURING THAT OUR FAMILIES ARE SUPPORTED. ECONOMICALLY BUT ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL RESOURCES TO HELP OUR FAMILIES MEET THOSE BASIC NEEDS ARE AS AN INTERVENTION OF ME WE KNOW CAPTIONS ASSISTANCE APPROVED HELP. AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES AS WE HEARD EARLIER ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE PROBABLY- ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE'RE NOT QUITE AT THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S A GOAL OF INCREASING THE MAXIMUM EIGHTEEN MINUTES. AT 250% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AFTER ALL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THE CURRENT PROPOSED INCREASE AS DIRECTOR JOHNSON MENTIONED EARLIER I HAVE A SEVEN POINT 1% WILL BRING AYE THOSE NON EXEMPT- MAPPING AT THAT TIME MAXIM EIGHT PAYMENT LEVELS TWO NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH. ACCORDING TO THE STATE UNIT OUR FAMILY THREE RESIDING IN ONE OF OUR HIGH COST COUNTY. WHICH IS AT LEAST A 54% OF THE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THIS PROPOSAL POINT ONE PER. IN IS ON THE OF. AT CURRENT PRODUCTION OF THE FUNDING IN THE HARPER AND SUPPORT SEVEN. I A REMINDER THAT SUB ACCOUNT IS TO THE BILL. OF TO THE- THESE INCREASES. JUST LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WE- WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A FIVE POINT 3% MAPPING CREATES. THAT INCREASE BROUGHT OUR OUR MAP LEVELS TO NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH ACCORDING TO THE STATE UNIT OF THREE RESIDING IN THOSE HIGH COST COUNTIES WHICH EQUATED 251% OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IN ADDITION TO THE- A INCREASE ON THE MAP LEVELS COLORS HAS EXPERIENCED. THAT THROUGH. A ROBUST INVESTMENT ONCE BUDGET CYCLE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OTHER IMPLEMENTING THIS YEAR TO SUPPORT FAMILIES IN SUPPORT OF THE BROADER ANTI POVERTY STRATEGY. FIRST WE WANTED TO MENTION TO THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD INCREASED SO AS A REMINDER THAT EARNED INCOME DISREGARD. ALLOWS APPLICANTS TO WAIT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EARNED INCOME FOR EACH EARNER IN THE FAMILY AT TIME OF APPLICATION FOR COWARDS BENEFITS. CURRENTLY IS THE AMOUNT THAT EARNER CAN WAIVE THE APPLICATION IS NINETY DOLLARS. AND THAT IS MOVING UP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR EACH EARNER AFFECTIVE JULY AT THIS YEAR. WE ALSO SAW EXPANSION AND INVESTMENTS FOR THE PREGNANCY SPECIAL NEEDS PAYMENTS THAT RECIPIENTS RECEIVED. AS WELL AS EXPANSION FOR PREGNANCY ELIGIBILITY RULES. AFFECTED IN MAY OF THIS YEAR WILL SEE THAT INCREASE TO THE PREGNANCY SPECIAL. PAYMENT WHICH IS A MONTHLY SUPPLEMENT THAT'S PROVIDED TO PREGNANT CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS AND THAT IS MOVING FROM FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. THEN EFFECTIVE IN JULY- WE'RE EXPANDING CAL WORKS ELIGIBILITY TO ALL PREGNANT ADULTS. WHO ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR CAL WORKS CASH EVEN SERVICES INCLUDING THAT MONTHLY PREGNANCY SPECIAL NEED PAVEMENT. AS A REMINDER PRIOR TO THIS MOVE A FOLKS HAD TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE FIRST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY I TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR A WORK. I WERE ALSO MOVING INTO IN MAY OF THIS YEAR TO A SIXTEEN MONTH TIME LIMIT SO THE CAL WORKS MAXIMUM TIME LIMIT WILL INCREASE FROM FORTY EIGHT MONTHS TO SIXTY MONTHS ADDING TWELVE ADDITIONAL MONTHS AND EVERYONE'S. AT A TIME EIGHT. WE ALSO SAW IT INVESTMENT TO SUPPORT FAMILY REUNIFICATION ARE THE BUDGET AS PROPOSED INCLUDES NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF CASH EVEN SERVICES WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF THE CONTINUATION OF CHILD CARE SERVICES FOR THE CHILD TO THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN. WE HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE HOME BY CHILD WELFARE SERVICES AND THAT IS THE FACT AND JULY OF THIS YEAR. THIS CONTINUATION OF AID AND SERVICES INTENDED TO HELP PROMOTE. THE PREVENTION OF FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT AND SUPPORT THE REUNIFICATION OF OUR POWERS FAMILY. THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION THAT- IN THE AGENDA AROUND HOW IT WORKS HE SPOKE. AT SO QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT ARE THAT THE RECENT TRENDS IN COLOR SCHEMES VOTE. APPLICATION DENIALS EXIT RATES WHAT ARE THE DEPARTMENT'S CONCERNED ABOUT TAKE UP RATES IN THE PROGRAM FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ENROLLED IN COLOR. SO START FIRST SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR COLOR EXCUSE OVERALL AND THEN I'LL SHARE A OF I THOUGHT. THAT THE COLOR EXTRA UP RIGHT. SO I'LL CAL WORK AT CONTINUE EXPERIENCE IN THE CO IN OVERALL KEY FEDERAL FIRST HALF. SB TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALENDAR YEAR AT WORKS X. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN APPLICATION VOLUME DURING THE LATE SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS OF LAST YEAR AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS WERE EXPERIENCING. A LOSS OF THOSE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS I HAD BEEN EXPANDED. BY THE DEPARTMENT WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FOLKS OVER AT UT DETAINED SURE% THAT. RECIPIENTS THAT WERE FACING THAT BENEFIT CLIPPING EDT. HAD ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION NEEDED TO APPLY FOR SAFETY NET BENEFITS THROUGH A COLECTIVE OUTREACH STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDED. BOTH CALFRESH AND HOW IT WORKS. WHERE STILL WAITING ON FINAL DATA THEM WHETHER THE INCREASE THAT WEEKS CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN CASE LOAD BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL SEE THAT INCREASE I ONCE THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DENIALS OF APPLICATIONS THAT WERE PROCESSED DURING THE PANDEMIC WERE HEAVILY DID NINETY TWO BEING OVER INCOME. A LIKELY ATTRIBUTED TO BE ADDED TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS OF FOLKS WERE RECEDING HOWEVER WE ONLY HAVE DATA AVAILABLE THROUGH JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WE'RE UNABLE TO SEE AT THIS TIME IF THAT TREND REMAINED VERY NICE EDT BENEFIT CLASS. CURRENTLY ARE KEY IS. OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES BUT AGAIN WAITING ON MORE ACCURATE DATA TO DEMONSTRATE A THE CASE OF INCREASES THAT WERE ANTICIPATING WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CANGES. TO EXIT RATES IS THE KEYSTONE. HAS HELD FAIRLY STEADY THIS PAST YEAR. AND THEN THE LAST NOTE ON OVERALL COLOR SCHEMES VOTERS BE IMPLEMENTED COULD CAUSE FOR MANY OF OUR WELFARE TO WORK PARTICIPANTS. WE ALSO EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN OVERALL SOLUTION PEACE BOAT I THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC A BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE BLANKET GOOD BECAUSE FOR MANY OF OUR WELFARE TO WORK PARTICIPATING. AT WORST THING SHOULD. NOW MAKE UP A JUST UNDER WORKS. SPEAKING OUT TO CALL WORKS PICK UP RATES HOW TAKE A- THAT WAS. BY THE L. A. O. AND- LAST YEAR. A IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWO ONE- REPRESENTS A MOST READ DATA. AT THE L. OF DEVELOP THE METHODOLOGY IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FOLKS OVER AT OUR DEPARTMENT- IN A RESEARCH AUTOMATION DATA TEAMS. AND THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT THIS IS AT THE BEST AND MOST RECENT ESTIMATE OF THE LOCAL. A CALCULATING THE TAKE UP RATE RELIES ON THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA. ATTENDRE STAND THE POTENTIAL POPULATION. AND THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS NOT RELEASED MORE RECENT ACS DATA I DO TO DATA COLLECTION CHALLENGES. RESULTING FROM THAT COMPANY. TEAM PANDEMIC. THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS THIS BUREAU TO RELEASE THE NEXT. OF THAT THE NEEDED DATA AND EARLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME ADDITIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT TO SEE IF THERE'S MORE INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE. IN ADDITION TO THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY THE ATLEO AT JUST LAST YEAR. IN TERMS OF BEING BUDGET- AND THE QUESTION PERTAINING TO THE BUDGET PROPOSED REDUCTION OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO. ELIGIBILITY IN ADMINISTRATION FUNDING FOR COUNTIES- WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING FOR COMICS ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION IS DETERMINED BY. A NEW YOUR METHODOLOGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN COORDINATION WITH ACCOUNTING. AND IMPLEMENTED IN FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AT THE VERY VERY HIGH CASELOAD- AT PROJECTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC COULD NOT BEREALIZED HOW WORKS ALTHOUGH THE FUNDING INCREMENTS WERE MAINTAINED AND PROVIDED YOU COUNTIES IN BOTH FISCAL YEARS. NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AT THE CASE IT IS PRETTY TO INCREASE FISCAL YEAR TWO EIGHTEEN THREE IT'S NOT INCREASING AND NOT TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEM. ALL OF THOSE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO INCREASE YOUR AND CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BUT BASED ON THE APPROVED METHODOLOGY THAT HE SPOKE WITH ME TO BE A FORECASTED INCREASED TO JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND HE SAYS. TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE FUNDING LEVEL THAT WAS PROVIDED. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ZERO. AT JUST AS A REMINDER FOR HOW THE CALL WORKS IN THE ALLOCATION IS FUNDED. THAT COLOR THE ALLOCATION FUNDS THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ONE BEING EMPLOYMENT SERVICES THE SECOND BEING ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN THE THIRD IS CAL LEARN INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT BUTTON. BUT OF THE TOTAL SINGLE OUT. FUNDING FISCAL YEARS TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WHAT WE SAW WAS 63% WENT TO PLYMOUTH SERVICES. 36% WENT YOU ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION AND JUST ABOUT 1% WAS DISTRIBUTED OUT. FOR THE THIRD CATEGORY. WE ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE OTHER COMPONENTS WITHIN THE CALL WORKS BUDGET THAT ARE NOT FUNDED WITHIN THE SINGLE ALLOCATION THAT ARE FUNDED SEPARATELY AND THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES. AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED THROUGH ART IN HEALTH CLINIC PARTNERS- IT THAT SINGLE PUBLICATION DOES NOT INCLUDE BE EXPENDED SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS THE WORK EXPERIENCE PROGRAM IN WHICH BUT WAGES ARE SUBSIDIZED FOR PARTICIPANTS SETTING EACH. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE FAMILIES PEOPLE IS EACH AND THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM AND THE COW WORKS IN PROGRAM BUT THE THAT YOU CAN FIND AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE. OF THAT PROGRAM. AND THEN LASTLY ON THE PEACE AROUND AT THE- BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE STATUS OF THE COLOR WORKGROUP. BUT WE IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR LAUNCHED THE POLICY ALIGNMENT WORK GROUP. OF THE WORK GROUP HAS MET THREE TIMES WITH A FOURTH AND FINAL SESSION SCHEDULED FOR THIS WEEK. I JUST OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ORIGINAL COLOR POLICY ALIGNMENT WORKGROUP REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN. A REPORT ON THE WORKGROUP. RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL SOME OF THE FEEDBACK AND INFORMATION IS BEING SHARED IN THAT SETTING. A TO SUPPORT BOTH CALOR AS WELL AS COUNTY DRIVEN COVERS TWO POINT OH PRINCIPLES. IS SCHEDULED TO STILL BE RELEASED ON APRIL FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM JANINE DR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI THIS IS JEANINE DR WITH FINANCE I NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS POINT BUT THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE L. L. GOOD AFTERNOON RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- NUMBERS TO ADD BUT DO YOU THINK IT BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE ADDRESSED- THAT BEING ABOUT THE CASE OF DYNAMICS IN THIS PROGRAM. I KNOW THIS IS BEEN. A CONTRAST TO THE LEGISLATURE IN GENERAL TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR AS IT HAS BEEN TO OUR OFFICE. THE CONTEXT IS THAT HISTORICALLY WE EXPECT THEM ONE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE FOR THAT IN. SPECIFICALLY WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH THE CASELOAD FOR CAL WORKS AND OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WILL GROW BY US OUR OFFICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WERE PROJECTING LARGE CASELOAD INCREASES- AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC RECESSION FOLLOWING THE PANDEMIC LAST YEAR- NOW ACTUALLY TWO YEARS AGO- BUT- THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WHAT WE SAW WAS A TEMPORARY INCREASE THAT SEEM TO BE. AS PRIMARILY BY SOME POLICY CHANGES IN THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS FOLLOWED BY LOVE PRECIPITOUS DROP THAT REALLY HAS NO PARALLEL THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF CAL WORKS- WE ENDED UP WITH THE LOWEST CASELOAD IN THE PROGRAM'S HISTORY- SOMEWHERE AROUND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES- AS OF LAST SUMMER. NOW THIS OF COURSE WAS A CONCERN FOR THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE RESTORATION PROCESS IN PART BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS REACHING AS MANY ELIGIBLE FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE IS ALSO A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE'RE TASKED WITH PROJECTING HOW MUCH THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO COST SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PROPER FORECASTING- SAID THAT AND FOR OUR OFFICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION INDEPENDENTLY INVESTIGATED. THE POTENTIAL CAUSES OF THIS AND I THINK REALLY THROUGH A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION WE BOTH CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THIS DYNAMIC HAS TO DO WITH THE EXCEPTIONAL OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT'S BEEN OFFERED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS- THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC OKAY AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE EXPANDED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WHICH NOW REACHES MORE PEOPLE THAN IT USED TO AND FOR A LONG TIME WAS OFFERING A REALLY SUBSTANTIAL BONUS- DOES YOUR Y. BENEFITS- LAPSED LAST SEPTEMBER AND SO BOTH OF OUR BOTH OUR OFFICE AND THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTED. MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE INFLECTION POINT THE POINT AT WHICH CASE THAT BEGAN TO GROW AGAIN IN LINE WITH OUR HISTORIC EXPECTATIONS FINANCIAL DATA WE NOW HAVE THROUGH DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR AT LEAST IN PART IT DOES SUGGEST THAT SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR WAS AN INFLECTION POINT FOR CASE THOUGH THAT WE DID SEE RESUMES GROWTH AFTER MANY MONTHS OF DECLINE BUT TODAY THAT GROWTH APPEARS RATHER MODEST SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWO THOUSAND CASES PER MONTH OLD OUR OFFICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTED SOMETHING CLOSER TO TEN THOUSAND CASES. PER MONTH. NOW ONE POSSIBLE. WHY WE'RE SAYING GROWTH THERE THAT THERE STILL. WAS SOME. EIGHT AND- TAKES CHILD TAX CREDIT- WHICH ONLY ALLOW LAST DECEMBER SO PERHAPS- WITH BATTLE ABSENT WILL WILL START TO SEE A SLOW GROW AT AN EVEN GREATER. ASIDE FROM THAT AND NO REAL SUB COMMENTS OF WHAT'S BEEN SAID SO FAR OR WHAT'S CONTAINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SHEMITAH GASKINS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF GRACE AND CHILD POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY AGAIN I'M SINGING ATKINS- RACED IN CHILD POVERTY CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN AND OUR ORGANIZATIONAL MISSION IS TO DARE TO IMAGINE A LIBERATED FUTURE. FREE FROM SYSTEMIC RACISM AND POVERTY IN WHICH ALL CHILDREN EXPERIENCE THE CHILDHOOD OF ABUNDANCE DIGNITY LOVE AND OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN HARD AT WORK IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE END CHILD POVERTY TASK FORCE PLAN. ONE THAT YOU ALL WORKED ON AS A LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO BY PROFESSOR DAVID GONSKI WHO YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER. TODAY THIRTY EIGHT OF THE FORTY THREE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EVIDENCE BASED HAVE BEEN ADOPTED. THESE ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN COMBINED PERMANENT ONGOING COMMITMENTS TOTALING ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION AND OVER THIRTEEN BILLION ANNUALLY WHEN ALL PROGRAMS GO INTO EFFECT. TOGETHER CALIFORNIA HAS LIFTED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY BY FEDERAL ACTIONS TAKING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS INCLUDING EXPANDED CHILD TAX CREDITS AND THE MULTIPLE STIMULUS PAYMENTS YOU JUST HEARD FROM MISTER ANDERSON. HOWEVER WE ARE ALREADY SEEING TELL POVERTY RATE PARTLY BOUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO ASK FEDERAL AND STATE ONE TIME SOLUTIONS FALL AWAY AND MANY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE AND THE POST PANDEMIC ERA. CALIFORNIA MUST TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO SUSTAIN AND BUILD ON ITS RECENT REDUCTIONS IN CHILD POVERTY. A CORNERSTONE OF THE INTEL POVERTY PLAN IS IT INDEED CHILD POVERTY ACROSS THE STATE AND CUT OVERALL POVERTY BY FIFTY PERCENT. CHILDREN BORN INTO DEEP POVERTY FACE SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGES THAT MAKES SCALING THE ECONOMIC LADDER ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING. POVERTY HAD INCOMES IN THE BOTTOM FIFTH OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION AS ADULTS COMPARED INCOME FAMILIES. ONE NATIONAL STUDY FOUND IN OTHER WORDS BEING AND DEEP POVERTY MORE THAN DOUBLES CHILDREN'S CHANCES OF HAVING VERY LOW INCOMES IN THE FUTURE. RELATIVE TO MIDDLE INCOME CHILDREN. THE STATE YOU SAID CHAIRED. A CHAIR AROUND AND MAY MADE STRIDES IN MOVING CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY IT'S DEEP ON. WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN THERE YET AND WE KNOW OUR CAL WORKS FAMILIES ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ESPECIALLY AS EMERGENCY SUPPORT SUBSIDE. WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET SURPLUS WE SEE STRONG AVENUES TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS THIS BUDGET CYCLE. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM ON ITS PROMISE TO END EACH OUT POVERTY BY INCREASING CAO WORKS GRANTS 250% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. USING AN ASSISTANCE UNIT PLUS ONE APPROACH AND TO CONTINUE THE SUSPENSIONS OF THE LIFETIME LIMITS BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. ADDITIONALLY THEM PORN VESTMENTS AND TE COW WORKS PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT RACIAL EQUITY IN BIAS TRAINING FOR COUNTY LEVEL CAO WORKS STAFFERS ARE VITAL TO CREATING A SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM THAT IS TRAUMA INFORMED. AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT. LASTLY CALIFORNIA SHOULD INVESTIGATE STATE FLEXIBILITIES THAT ALLOW THE REMOVAL OF HISTORICALLY RACIST CLASSES IN CFO THE POLICIES IN THE CALVET PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS CENTERED IN WHOLE CHILD WHOLE FAMILIES TO PRODUCE THAT PARTICIPANTS WITH DIGNITY AND CARE. MEMBERS AND THE WEALTHY ESTATE AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO FAR IT IS A MORAL AND FISCAL IMPERATIVE THAT NO FAMILIES OR CHILDREN LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY. THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR YOUR TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU NEXT WILL HEAR FROM JENNIFER. WITH PARA VOICE CAL. HELLO CHAIRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER CRAPPIE WITH PARA PLACES CALIFORNIA A STATEWIDE PARENT LED ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING A DIVERSE GROUP OF THEM. MY TESTIMONY WILL OFFER TO EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES NAVIGATING THE COW WORKS PROGRAM PROCESS TO APPLY FOR CAL WORKS IS OVERWHELMING AND BURDENSOME WHEN FAMILIES ARE IN CRISIS THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS ADDITIONAL STRESS AND TRAUMA FROM THE ONE PLACE. THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP. AS A FORMER CAL WORKS PARTICIPATE MYSELF. I KNOW ALL TOO WELL JUST HOW SCARY IT CAN BE TO WALK THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY ASK FOR HELP. WHEN I MADE THAT JOURNEY ALMOST SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS TERRIFIED GRIEVING AND RECOVERING FROM UNSPEAKABLE TRAUMA. FILLING OUT THE APPLICATION GETTING APPROVAL AND STARTING MY JOURNEY WAS NO EASY TASK. BUT ONCE I WAS IN I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO LEARN ABOUT A SPECIAL PROGRAM AT MY ORIENTATION CALLED THE FAMILY SERVICE TEAM. STARTING THAT DAY I WAS MET WITH FIVE SOCIAL WORKERS ALL THERE TO HELP ME SUCCEED WE WORKED ON MY CHILD CARE NEEDS MY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT BY LEGAL CHALLENGES MY HOUSING CHALLENGES MY MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND HONESTLY MORE CHALLENGES THAN I CAN EVEN REMEMBER. THE SERVICES STARTED ROLLING IN IMMEDIATELY AND EACH MONTH ALONG THE WAY MY TWO YEAR JOURNEY WE MET AROUND A TABLE AND TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY CAN HELP TO SUPPORT ME AND WHAT THEY COULD DO TO HELP. BECAUSE OF THAT IN MY HARD WORK I RECEIVED MY A DEGREE BEGAN WORKING FULL TIME AND HELD ON TO MY CHILD CARE UNTIL MY CHILDREN AGED OUT DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR SOME PEOPLE. OUR SYSTEM INVOLVES WRAPPING OUR ARMS AROUND THESE PARENTS SUPPORTING THEM WITH THEIR OWN CHALLENGES WHATEVER THEY MAY BE. THE EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH CAO WORKS UNFORTUNATELY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE SEEKING SERVICES TODAY. NOW LET ME SHARE THE EXPERIENCE OF ONE OF THOSE FANS. GALLERY STORY REPRESENTS SO MANY OF THE CHALLENGES PARENTS FACE WHEN TRYING TO ACCESS OUR WORK. VALERIE IS A BLACK ENGLISH SPEAKING MOTHER OF FOUR HAS A MASTER'S DEGREE AND AS A- FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDER POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AFTER THE BIRTH OF HER FOURTH CHILD. THE ISOLATION FROM EPENTHETIC COUPLED WITH THE POST PARTUM DEPRESSION SALARY NEEDED SUPPORT FROM THE SOCIAL SERVICES SAFETY NET THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO HELP PEOPLE IN HER SITUATION RECIPIENT. VALERIE WAS ALREADY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE STAGE TO CHILD CARE SHE NEEDED TO GET BACK ON HER FEET. HOWEVER SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE NEEDED TO REAPPLY AND ENDED UP WAITING MONTHS SUBMITTING A MOUNTAIN OF PAPERWORK AND MAKING COUNTLESS PHONE CALLS OFTEN TO CENTRAL PHONE SYSTEMS WERE CALLS WERE NEVER ANSWERED. AFTER MONTHS WITH NO REYES RESOLUTION SHE GAVE UP. VALERIE DIDN'T BAIL THE SYSTEM DID. THIS IS NOT THE SYSTEM THAT WE NEED. THIS IS THE SYSTEM WE WALKED. BUT THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT IS FAILING FAR TOO MANY FAMILIES. WE HAVE TO FACE THE FACT THAT THERE IS RACISM IN THE SYSTEM. I CANNOT IGNORE THAT MY EXPERIENCE AS A WHITE MOTHER. WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM VALERIE'S AS A BLACK MAN. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS TODAY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A METAL DETECTOR. AND THE FIRST PERSON THAT THEY SEE AND COME IN CONTACT WITH IS A SECURITY GUARD SOCIAL WORKER READY TO HELP. LET ME LOOK AT HOW OUR PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THEIR STRUCTURE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE WITH THE MOST CHALLENGES WHEN IT ENGLISH SPEAKING MASTER DEGREE HOLDEN MOM WHO IS A MEMBER OF AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND SITS ON A VARIETY OF POLICY COUNCIL. CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. NEARLY THE SYSTEM IS FAILING WHEN WE MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PARENTS WE MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL PARENTS. AND THAT MAKE ISN'T. TO REBUILD AND RE CREATE SYSTEMS THAT ACTUALLY WORK FOR FAMILIES BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT HAS TO BE DRIVEN BY THOSE DIRECTLY IMPACTED. RECENTLY WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO ENGAGE FAMILIES AROUND IMPROVING THE CAL WORKS AND CHILD CARE SYSTEMS TO THE CREATION OF A PARENT ADVISORY. IF CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS WITH BLACK FAMILIES CHINESE AND SPANISH SPEAKING FAMILIES AND TRIBAL. WE WILL SHARE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THE LADY UP AS SOON AS THEY'RE READY IMPROVING THE SYSTEM CANNOT WORK WITHOUT CENTERING THE VOICES THAT HAVE BEEN IGNORED FOR FAR TOO LONG. CAREFULLY SAYS IS READY TO PARTNER WITH ANYONE WHO AGREE. AND I DO HAVE A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME DIRECTLY FROM HOW WORKS PARTICIPANTS THAT I WILL BE SENDING TO THE COMMITTEE RIGHT AFTER THIS HEARING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT INFORMATION NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MIKE HERALD WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. PEOPLE. HE SAID. WHERE I AM ABLE HEAR YOU MIGHT IF- YOU'RE STILL ON MUTE ABOUT NOW CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS YEAR WE HEAR YOU ALLOW AND CLEAR GO AHEAD. VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR ALERTING ME- SEASONAL I'M SAYING SELECT COMMITTEE ON POVERTY. FUNDING WHILE THIS CAN BE HAS DONE- GREAT. OVER YEARS AND ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. I HIGHER. YOUR THE ISSUE IS. AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD. TO PROTECT. WITH THE- INNOCENT APPLE- I'VE BEEN OUT TO ANSWER- SOME. TO BEFORE I DO THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY. THAT WE WILL WANT TO SAY. ARE ALSO WITH THE- OF. THE STAFF CAN. AND MUST- HAVE WORKED WITH THE TO WORK. FOR SOMETIME NOW. AND WE SHARE COMMON CONCERN AND IS AND FIRST. ON HOURS PROGRAM ON THE ISSUE OF POP MONTROSE AND CAL- AND WE THINK THERE'S- THAT CAN BE DONE- TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO MAKE THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY OUTLINE. IN THEIR ARE MORE ARE THINGS THAT THE COMMITTEE. SAID TAKE A VERY LOOK AT. I WANT TO DRESS OF THE THAT YOU CAN EARLY IN YOUR CASE IN YOUR QUESTION FROM PARK. MISTER CHAIR. AND THAT WAS- ABOUT THE SITE. ABOUT IT SOME APPLIES FOR SAY THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. SHOULD WE NOT BE REFERRED THEM WATER. TO OTHER. THAT IF YOU'RE THAT THEY WERE BE IN. TO FOR OF THE LIGHT BULBS BUT WORK. I THINK THIS IS THE ISN'T POSTED OVER- AND I THINK- SEE THIS- BUT SHE- OF ARC. APPROACH IN THE NUMBER OF- OKAY JUST RATES BY MINUTES FOR EXAMPLE ON. THIS PLEDGE. AND MANY GOVERNOR HAVE WORKED. TO MEDIC. OF RATE. I'M MORE OF. RECENT YEARS ESPECIALLY WITH THE EXPANSION OF CALPERS STUDENT. AT THE SITE WHICH BAND. AND BUT WHEN WE COME TO CAL WORKS. I KNOWLEDGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE RECENT DATA FROM EIGHTY UP ON THIS ISSUE- BUT THE- PUT THERE'S REASON TO THINK THAT ARE THAT ARE PERFORMANCE ISSUES DROPPING THE- OF THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE- AND WE WANT TO TALK STATES IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT WE'VE MAINTAINED OUR OUR PERSPIRATION RATE STRONGLY. BUT WITH THIS RECENT DROP IN THE CASE OF THE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WE HAVE REASON TO THINK ABOUT NUMBERS NOW DROP. PUBLISHED BELOW 50% THE AMERICAN AREA THAT WE THINK THE WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE THANK A VERY STRONG LOOK AT I THINK THIS IDEA OF AN SO CALLED NO WAY POLICY FOR GETTING PEOPLE IN THE TOWERS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT DOING. BUT THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE COULD BE DOING THAT- TO ADDRESS OTHER BARRIERS TO GETTING ON TO CHALLENGE THAT I'M MORE PREFIX SIMPLY BY HAVING YOU KNOW ONE MORE POLICY SO YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY SOME OF THESE BEFORE BUT I WILL TAKE THEIR REPEATED I BELIEVE SOME WE SHOULD A WOMAN THE CALLED THE IN THE FACT THAT THE MEN WILL BE STANDARDS ADEQUATE. WHICH IS A- ALL MEDICATIONS HOW MUCH INCOME PEOPLE CAN HAPPEN A FIVE FOR THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY A FAMILY CAN ONLY MAKE A FAMILY 310-005-0030 NINE DOLLARS A MONTH IN ORDER TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM THAT'S ABOUT 80% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL RIGHT. NOW SO WE'RE LEAVING. SIGNIFICANT NOT OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY UNABLE TO ACT IS FOR. BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS ARE. AMONGST WE GET RID OF THE OF A CATS. ON THEIR A BILL ON THE LINE. NOW TO DO THAT ON THE TABLE. OF ONE HUNDRED HOUR WAR. KNOWN AGAIN THIS IS A THIS IS JUST A ARTIST BARRIER THAT WE CREATED. THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON OUR PROGRAM- IT AT. WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT- ALL MOVING AWAY AS FROM WORK REQUIREMENTS AND RICHARD REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- MAYOR TOM JOHNSON EARLIER THAT THIS MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE RADICAL- WE DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY THAT RADICAL AT ALL- WE THINK THAT THE DAYS WHERE WE HAVE THE ONE THAT'S VERY STRICT COMPLIANCE PROGRAM IS JUST NOT- IT COMPORTS WITH THE REALITY OF CURRENT LIGHT PEOPLE HAVE MANY OPTIONS THEY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE PEOPLE CAN GET A DRY A JOB- DELIVERED COMMUTER WORKING FOR UBER THEY CAN MAKE MONEY THEY DON'T NEED TO JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS THAT WE CREATED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT MAKE IT SO HARD FOR PEOPLE TO STAY ON THE BOOKS AND- PEOPLE. ARE WILLING TO DO THAT AS MUCH ANYMORE THE WORK REQUIREMENT COMMITTEE AND STRICT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE ARE I THINK A MAJOR BARRIER PEOPLE JUST AREN'T WILLING TO DEAL WITH ALL THIS ANYMORE- BUT ADDITIONALLY- ALL. WE ALSO THINK THAT WE TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE VERY. WORK IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA ABOUT THE RE WHY T. ARE DOING HER EIGHT- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE MONTH THERE. A WATER SO PROCEDURAL THE NILE. B. FOR WILL YOU SPELL IN THE THAT ONE TALK TO. ABOUT WHAT MEANS. IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE. GAVE UP DURING PLAYOFFS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME OF YOUR PARKING AND FOR AND DATA ABOUT PAP COMPLY. OF THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT YOU SIMPLY DIDN'T WORKING HAVE A CLUE TO TRACK DOWN THE PEOPLE INTO WALK WITH THEIR- DROPPED OUT DON'T. TO THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE INTO LAW OF THESE VERIFICATION REQUIRED. AND STREAMED AND REALLY CUTTING THE BACK TO IS GOING TRUE NOTHING. SO WHAT HAPPENED I WILL JUST MEANT USE THAT THAT- IS UP THERE WITH THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE CAN BEGIN ALSO TO MAKE. SO FOR ALL BETTER NOW BUT WE'VE WORKED WITH THE PASCO TRYING TO SPEND OUT SEVERAL OF THE- RELAXING. OF BOYS THAT BIG. ORDER AND FOR TWENTY GOVERNMENT NAME SANCTIONS FOR. PROVIDED BLANCA GOOD CALL YOU'RE- IN THE PROBE. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TIMES OF PEOPLE TO MAKE OFF WITH THE KEEPING DOWN TO THE WILD OFFICE- THANKFULLY LAST MUCH. DOOR ELECTRIC SIGNATURES AND THAT PERHAPS THAT WAS OF THE- AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING MORE THINGS LIKE THAT TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK THAT. THE PEOPLE GET THE FULL BENEFIT BUT THE NEED. A NEW ONE AFTER EVERY JUST SAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN BE GET SCHOOL. THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW FAMILY. AND FAMILIES. AND HER FAMILY COULD TRYING TO OFFICE SYSTEM. PETER ARTICLE BERRY WE CAN A LET ME THEM PROVIDE THE ONLY THING THAT. AND WE SHOULD DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THAT OUR PROGRAMS- AND THE RULES THAT ARE PROGRAMS CAN PLAY. IN HELPING TO- I IMPROVE AND REDUCE POVERTY- LET'S SEE LET ME GET MY NOTE- OVER HERE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW- CONTINUE ON- WE WILL HAVE TERRORISTS. AND THINK ABOUT- WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND AND I WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT INFORMATION THAT ALSO KIND OF PIGGY BACK I THINK ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHER CHANNELS ARE SO UP IN BOTH. AND THEN TAKE THE- AS A RESULT OF THIS APPLICATION. I THINK- AND LOOKING AT THE DATA WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THESE BONDS THAN VOLUME. BEGINNING IT AT THAT YOU KNOW VERY BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE ALSO SAW THE PHONES AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. WHICH OF COURSE- THAT- CDSS REPRESENTATIVE MENTIONED WAS WHAT AND- THE U. Y. EXTENSION THE BOMBS FOR A- TO TEMPORARILY LAPSED. IN THE STATE- WORKED WITH EDT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNEW THAT THEY HAD OTHER PLACES TO GO. WE THOUGHT VERY QUICK BONTA N. OUR CASELOAD- OUR OUR APPLICATIONS A RESULT OF THAT. AND THEN AGAIN A MUCH LARGER INCREASE AT THE- END OF THE YEAR Y. EXTENSIONS AND INCREASES THAT HAPPENED. NEAR THE END OF LAST YEAR WE IN FACT WENT FROM AN AVERAGE OF AROUND EIGHT THOUSAND APPLICATIONS PER WEEK. AT THE BEGINNING A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHICH HAD BEEN DECREASING AS MR HURLED NOTED. TO AN AVERAGE OF AROUND FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOR A WEEK AT THE TIME THAT YOU AYE LAPSED- AT THE END OF I'M TWENTY TWENTY ONE- YOU WHY IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN A DRIVER I THINK TO KEEP. THE APPLICATION AND CAPABLE BUT LOWER. DURING MUCH OF THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THE U. Y. WAS. INCREASED SO MUCH OF EXTENDED FOR SO LONG. THAT FAMILIES WERE THAT COUNTIES RUNNING. HOW SO IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE. A UPTICK IN THE CASESONE THAT WAS. IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO UNDER. THAT- STATES LARGELY LEFT TO THE TERM OF THE OWN. FOR ALLEGED AND GRANT WHILE. IN THE CAL WORKS OR NATIONAL THAT AFTER ONE OF CALLED. AND HELLO. SIR THE- PERCENTAGE OF THE- WHO ARE I PART IF ANY STATE OTHER THAN VERMONT. FOR EVERYONE HUNDRED FAMILY WHO LIVE IN POVERTY HELLO FAMILIES ARE PROGRAM. AND IN FACT. STATE SERVICE. ONE IN TEN AND STUFF. I IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER TO THE- DIED SHE THE MIGHT MAY. IN OUR- AND SOME OF THEM WERE MENTIONED THE SCRAP INVESTOR HERALD. THINGS SUCH AS OF THE ARE CHANGE THAT WE'VE TO SOME TO GET WITH YOUR- MISTER CHAIR AN- THAT INDIVIDUALS TO GET ON- THROUGH. INCREASED THEIR ACT- INCOME DISREGARD AND THAT STATE ON THE PROGRAM WE THEY DO BECAUSE TO WORK IN IN. THEIR WAY GIVE ARE. THOSE CHOICES THAT HELP CAN HIM SO WE CAN CAN. TO MAKE SOME OF THE ADDITION CHANGE ALSO THINK WE THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY OVER OR- THAT ARE CURRENT SOME THAT FAMILIES HAVE FILL IN. EVERY SIX. AND IF THEY THAT THEY IN THE CAN BE THE FIFTEEN FROM THE PRO- WE'RE- OF WHAT IT'S A AREN'T. IT'S MORE OF A THIS PAPERWORK FOR. SIMILAR TO THE VERY. REQUIRED. TO FIND TO THE LONGER REQUIRE THOSE. ONE OF THE THING I THINK WE WANT TO ABOUT THAT IS THAT THERE ARE A PRO THAT OF OUR- ARE L. FOR. CALFRESH AND CAL AND THOSE DO YOU HAVE YOU GET VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS SO WANT TO ABOUT. ARE WE ABLE TO MAKE. IN THOSE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY HEALTH RIGHTS WHICH HAS BEEN PRETTY STRINGENT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT ON THE CALFRESH PANEL IN A WHILE SOME IDEAS THAT WE HAVE- THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE WORK GROUP TO THINK ABOUT. THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME FEDERAL CHANGES IN THE CALFRESH PROGRAM HEALTHWORKS WE COULD MAKE THOSE CHANGES. AND THEN WE'D BE OPERATING TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES AND WE JUST HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES THAT THAT MIGHT INTRODUCED FOR FAMILIES. OR FOR OUR WORKERS. HISTORICALLY I THINK OF THIS BOILS DOWN TO OUR PRO. IS PRETTY TOGETHER HALF- BEFORE THE NIGHT NINETIES- ONE REFORM STAFF. WERE ENACTED THE THING EVEN. YOU KNOW IT WOULD NOW THAT WE GOT POWER. WITH A STARK HAD A VERY. OR SISTER. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT IS. IN CLASSES FACT THIS AND RACIST- RULES OF- YOU KNOW COUNTY THE NUMBER OF. IN THE- AND- VIEWING PARENTS WHO LIVING POVERTY AS SOME. I'M NOT ABLE TO CARE FOR THEIR- THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ECHOES FACT YOU SEE. OUR AND I HELLO WE BEEN A TO MAKE THE- STRIDES. THERE'S MORE TO IT MORNING. AS WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO. AGAIN YOUR STUFF. ON AS WELL. THAT AND HAVE A KID. TO REALLY BUILD OUT AND THINK ABOUT HOW TO EMPLOY. THE TYPE OF TRAINING. AND INITIATIVES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR AND THAT ARE NOW UNDER WAY AS. WE THINK ABOUT CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. ON THE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD ASK TO ADDRESS IS- RELATED TO THE HI- AND I KNOW- THE- RECORD. TALK TO BENEFIT AND WHY WILL BE THE RESULT OF THAT ELIGIBLE HOPPER. KIND OF IT KIND THE PAST. WE DO ON. HOW THESE MINUTES. TECHNICALLY CALCULATED THE AMOUNT OF THE COPPER THE HOME SIXTEEN DOLLAR- ABOUT NINE. OF OUR- CURRENT ELIGIBILITY OPERATIONS BUDGET. THAT PROPOSED CUT IS SO SIGNIFICANT AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN CASES. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT. OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE RATE WE DID JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHAT THE STATE WAS TOTALLY EITHER NARROW THE SWINGS. BETWEEN UP TURNS AND DOWNTURNS AND IN CASELOADS AND THE ECONOMY WHAT WE WERE SAYING IS THAT COUNTIES WERE GETTING. VERY LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS GOING DOWN AND. CASELOADS WERE- WE'RE GOING- BUT STILL WE WERE CAN THAT ON SO THE IDEA WAS TO OF NAY THAT KIND OF- YOU KNOW KIND OF MINIMIZE THE SWINGS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE THINK AND NINE PERCENT. CUT OF THAT MAGNITUDE AND WHAT IT TAKES OF THIS GOING UP IS JUST- CERTAINLY NOT MINIMIZING THE SWING I GUESS I'D SAY- THE EFFECTS OF SUCH A CUT IS THAT COUNTY. HOW TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN YEAH WE HAVE TO CONTINUE EXTRA ACCEPT AND PROCESS APPLICATIONS THAT'S EXTREMELY CRITICAL AND AS YOU HEARD WHEN THAT BREAKS DOWN AND PEOPLE DON'T GET THEIR BENEFITS. IT LEADS TO MORE HUNGER MORE HOMELESSNESS AND JUST GREATER POVERTY AND GREATER INEQUALITY- OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE BUDGET INCLUDED A LOT OF NEW RESOURCES FOR INCREASED CASE MANAGEMENT. FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE MORE COMPLEX SITUATIONS AND TO HELP US REALLY START TO MOVE TOWARD THE CAL WORKS TWO POINT OH PRINCIPLES THE FEW WTA HOPE TO DEVELOP AND CHAMPION- OUR CONCERN IS THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SHIFTED. AWAY FROM EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND FOR ITS ELIGIBILITY OPERATIONS EVEN OVER THE LAST YEAR COUNTY OVERSPEND OUR ELIGIBILITY BUDGET BY ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS I THINK IT WAS ABOUT A 103% OF THAT AMOUNT SO 3% OR ABOUT EIGHTEEN. MILLION DOLLARS AND WE SHIFTED THAT PROBLEM EITHER CHILD CARE OR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY. NOW THE CHILD CARE IS NO LONGER IN THAT SINGLE APPLICATION AND TO WHERE THAT MONEY'S GOING TO COME FROM THE FROM PLANET SERVICES AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED. WHEN YOU PUT THAT MONEY AND IT'S NOT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDED LAST YEAR WITH THAT BUDGET WITH FINE AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. AND PROVIDE THAT EXCELLENT SERVICE BUT- IF WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN BE FOUND ELIGIBLE IF THEY NEED THESE BENEFITS THAT'S WHAT COUNTIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. AND IT JUST- IT JUST MAKES THE WHOLE PROGRAM OPERATE LESS EFFECTIVELY IF WE'RE SHIFTING FUNDS. AROUND WE THINK THE FUNDING SHOULD BE AFTER AND- STEP THAT BEAT THAT. HAPPY TO HEAR ANY. THANK YOU MUCH WITH I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DRIVE TO SEE IF ANY MEMBER OF. SEEN NINE. KEEP IT HERE AT THE- I WILL BY ECHOING WHAT JENNA GRATZ SAID ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO OUR ARMS AROUND THE PARENTS WHO ARE. BEING BRAVE ENOUGH AND SECURE ENOUGH TO ASK FOR HELP. INSTEAD OF FORCING THEM TO WAIT MONTHS ON A CENTRALIZED PHONE SYSTEM. I WOULD AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS NOT VALERIE WHO FAILED BUT THE SYSTEM ITSELF THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED. AND SO WILL LOOK TOWARDS MANY OF THESE COMPLIANCE ORIENTED SYSTEMS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE CURRENT UP TO. THE DAY UP TO THE MINUTE ATA ON TAKE A BREAK. AND SO I KIND OF WANT TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IF I CAN AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE L. E. O. CAME OUT WITH INFORMATION IN FEBRUARY OF. TWENTY ONE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE- FURTHER INFORMATION UNTIL EARLY IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THEY'RE REALLY CREATES A GAP IN DATA FOR US RIGHT. NOW AT WHAT IS AN INFLECTION POINT. WHAT WAS REFERENCE WITHIN THE AGENDA WAS THE U. Y. WHICH RELAPSED ON SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR WAS THAT INFLECTION POINTS THAT I'M- REALLY WANTING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE CAN. MAKE SURE WE ARE COLLECTING THAT DATA GOING FORWARD SO WE CAN MAKE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES IN REAL TIME AND HOPING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. CAN COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE ALLEY- WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AMOUNT OF CASES PER MONTH VERSUS WHAT WAS PREDICTED. THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR US AS THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE AS WE WERE MAKING BUDGET DECISIONS THIS YEAR. AND I'M WONDERING WHY THAT INFORMATION. IS NOT MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO US. THANK YOU KAREN I CAN GET STARTED ON THE RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION SO IN TERMS OF THE TAKE UP WITH THE L. A. ANALYSIS RELIED HEAVILY ON THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU DATA. AT THAT IS THE DATA WERE WE ARE EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT WAGON UPDATED INFORMATION DUE TO THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND THE ABILITY TO COLLECT A CENSUS LEVEL DATA. WE DO HAVE SOME DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND OTHER DATA AVAILABLE TRUST THE DEPARTMENT THAT WERE- WORKING TO EXPLORE WE DO NOT HAVE A DEEP JUST YET ON WHEN WE CAN. PRODUCE THAT ANALYSIS BUT GIVEN SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD TODAY TODAY. HAPPY TO TAKE ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK A AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT FOLKS WANT TO SEE IS THAT- ANALYSIS AT THE DATA IS AVAILABLE. I THINK THE OTHER PIECE ON A TAKE THAT TAKE UP RATE AT THE SIXTY. RATE- ENGAGEMENT WITH THE FOLKS OF CRAPPIE IS FOLKS EXPERIENCE. BENEFIT CLAPPED WELL ABOUT FOUR MILLION. CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IN SEPTEMBER AND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKLE THE FACTOR. FOR WIND. ANY TIME AND WHEN FOLKS ACTUALLY LOST CERTAIN AND BENEFITS. SO WHILE FOLKS STARTED TO ABOUT AND TO LATE. THAT MAY NOT HAVE IMPROPER SOME. SOME FAMILY INTO A- NO TWO DEPENDING ON A RECEIPT OF BENEFITS- IN SO. WE DO NOT HAVE A- ED THAT THE KEY SLOW DATA. I'M THE WHAT TURNED IN FROM WHAT TURNED FROM AN APPLE CANNOT EASE UP THE LATER MONTHS OF YEAR THE NEW ABOUT A MONTH LAG IN KEY DATE AND SO WE HOPE TO HAVE THAT I AT READY TO. YOUR SOON. IT I WOULD COST. MAKE SURE WE ARE LOOK AT THE- SCOPE WE ARE TALK ABOUT MILLION OF CALIFORNIANS WHO. LOST UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND. PEOPLE PER MONTH TWO. NOW ARE BEING ENROLLED INTO CAL WORKS AND I'M STILL WONDERING. WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANOTHER METRIC WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT RATHER THAN- US CENSUS INFORMATION WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A STATE RUN METRIC THAT WE MAY WANT TO BE LOOKING OUT AND TRACKING AS WELL. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS INFORMATION IN REAL TIME IN THE MIDST OF. THIS PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE MAXIMIZING AS MANY FAMILIES TO RECEIVE BENEFITS. THAT I'D I'D LIKE TO JUST FOLLOW UP AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. I'D I'D LIKE TO THE TRANSITION AND I WILL PULL AND WHAT A DATA POINT FROM THE ENDING POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE SAW THAT. PIANOS DISPROPORTIONATELY WERE IN POVERTY COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION FOR CALIFORNIANS. THAT I'D LIKE TO GET INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE USE SIZE AND THE EXCLUSION OF ARE UNDOCUMENTED. POPULATION AS I BELIEVE THAT MAYBE. GETTING TO THAT. OF POVERTY RATE THAT WE'RE WE LEARNED FROM THE FIRST PANEL THE IMPORTANCE FOR US TO. SUPPORT OVERLOOKED POPULATIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE- AND- WHETHER THIS IS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WE- CAN BEGIN TO HAVE AS I THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS. THE COMPLEXITIES THAT MANY OF OUR FAMILIES ARE FACING IN OUR STATE. SO IN REQUEST THE DATA ON THE IMPACT OF UNDOCUMENTED- AT THAT POINT OUT THINGS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING POVERTY I KNOW IT CAN HI I DIRECTOR JOHNSON HAD MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE PRESIDENT THAT WHILE CAO WORKS DOES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SERVE CHILD ONLY CASES. THAT INCLUDES FAMILIES THAT HAVE MIXED STATUS WE CAN- TAKE THAT QUESTION BACK TO EXPLORE WHAT DATA WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND TO SEE IF WE CAN USE THAT TO ALSO INFORM THE ANALYSIS THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER AROUND PROGRAM REACH. BUT I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE AGAIN IF THE PARENTSWERE COUNTED INTO THE A YOU SIZE THEY WOULD RECEIVE A LARGER BENEFIT. THUS ALLOWING US TO ADDRESS THE POVERTY FR MANY OF THESE FAMILIES. AND BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO COUNT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE FAMILIES WHO ARE EXPERIENCING POVERTY. REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND- WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOLLOW UP. ON THAT CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD. THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE FOR US TO AS WE GET INTO ISSUES FIVE LATER ON TODAY BUT I DO HAVE A FEW REQUESTS FROM THE CHAIR. BEFORE WE MOVE ON FROM TODAY. AND THERE ARE A SERIES OF REQUESTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN THE AGENDA THAT I WANT TO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH ARE CURRENTLY LISTED ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR. I'D LIKE TO KINDLY ASK DSS TO PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING. FIRST THE ESTIMATES TO BRING ALL GRANTS FROM DEEP POVERTY FOR IN A U. PLUS ONE UP TO FIFTY PERCENT. SECOND THE ADMINISTRATION TAKE UP RATES FOR CAL WORK SO THAT WE CAN TRACK THIS OVER TIME AS A STATE GOVERNMENT. THIRD TO REPORT BACK FROM DSS AT FUTURE HEARINGS ON THESE REQUESTS AND ON THE ISSUES IDENTIFIEDWITHIN THIS AGENDA. AND FINALLY THE ANALYSIS REGARDING THE SINGLE ALLOCATION REDUCTION FOR ELIGIBILITY SERVICES. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE WORK WITH MY SUB COMMITTEE ON MY STAFF TO ENSURE THE RESPONSIVENESS TO THESE REQUESTS. AND QUESTIONS AND DO WANNA SAY THANK YOU IN ADVANCE BUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE WILLING AND AMENABLE TO ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD. DEPARTMENT. YESTERDAY I JUST WOULD ALSO LIKE TO FLAG I THINK YOU CHAIR FOR THAT FOR THAT QUESTION WE WERE ABLE TO CONDUCT AN INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE COST OF THE AT BEING ABLE TO BRING A CALL WORKS FAMILIES AND THAT EIGHT YOU PLUS ONE CATEGORY UP 23% OF THE F. P. AND BASED ON THE INITIAL PRODUCTION CONSIDERING THAT THE SEVEN POINT ONE BILLION- AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT TO BRING- ALL THAT THAT YOU THAT THE FAMILIES PLUS ONE. UP 250% NPL THRESHOLD. FOR THE OTHER GROUP. AS A MAN WE ARE WERE INTO TO IN A RIGHT NOW THIS IS BASED ON OF A CRITERIA SHARED AS WELL AS SOME OTHER FEEDBACK- AND WE- SO MORE TO COME ON THE- ANALYST. AROUND UP RIGHT. WE WILL NOW TURN TO ASSEMBLY RUBIO FOR QUEST LINE DO YOU HAVE A FRAME AS TO A WE CAN GET SIM FROM. TO CLARIFY ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THE DATA ANALYSIS HE SAYS THAT IT WILL PICK UP THE PIECES THAT WE JUST THAT AND WHY WAS WOULD LIKE CLARIFICATION BUT- THE CHAIR ASK YOU KNOW FOR ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED AND I. YOU KNOW I NEED A SPECIFIC TIMELINE SO THAT I KNOW- WENT TO- YOU KNOW ASK AGAIN- JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE ON THIS. WHICH FOR THE DAY TO TAKE A BREAK DATA NOW. I'M DO NOT A TIMELINE WHERE WE ARE WORKING IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR INTERNAL RESEARCH AUTOMATION AND DATA PARTNERS- TO WORK ON THAT ANALYSIS. A NOW ONE IN FIVE BY. UP FOR THE DATA AND INFORMATION AROUND THE COST ANALYSIS OF BRINGING FAMILIES UP BEEN COMPLETED AND PROVIDED SO WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. AND THEN FOR THE ANALYSIS ON THE- MUNDINE. FOR THE YEAR I'M ALLOCATION THAT GOES OUT TO COUNTY IS ON THE ELIGIBILITY. ADMINISTRATION BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN COMPLETED AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THE ACCESS THAT INFORMATION AS WELL. THANK YOU AND WHEN YOU MEAN OUR FOLKS HAVE ACCESS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS IT ON A- WEBSITE SOMEWHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SEND US THE INFORMATION DIRECTLY. WE WILL. SEND THE INFORMATION TO YOU DIRECTLY THANK YOU. WITHOUT AYE- AS WE ARE CLOSING ISSUE TOO WIDE I DO WANT TO DRAW A PARALLEL TO ISSUE ONE WHERE WE SPOKE ABOUT MANY OF THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH- CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE POVERTY THAT WE HAVE DOWNSTREAM. AND THE ABILITY FOR US TO PREVENT AND GET UPSTREAM AYE I BELIEVE THAT CAL WORKS IS EXACTLY ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS THEREFORE ABLE TO IMPROVE AND- BETTER INCREASE ACCESS WERE SIMILARLY ABLE TO THEN PREVENT MANY PEOPLE FROM ENTERING INTO POVERTY. AND THUS CREATING BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM GOING FORWARD I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO GET THIS DONE RIGHT WHILE LISTENING TO THOSE WHO ARE USING THE SYSTEMS AND THE STRUGGLES THERE HAVE IN ACCESSING THE PROGRAMS. I THINK THERE'S A LOTS OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER AND LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE PER CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND AN OVERSIGHT OVER THE KEY PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS I'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THE PANELISTS FOR ISSUE TO AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. WE WILL HAVE THREE EXCUSE ME EIGHT PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL WE WILL BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR DAVID KILGOUR FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. FOLLOWED BY KRISTEN DONNA D. CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE CHILD CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. BY FOLLOWED JALIL BAKER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JACQUI BUT OSSEO WITH L. A. L. MIKE HERALD WITH THE WESTERN CENTER. ON LAW AND POVERTY AND THE SERVER FLORI PARENTS LEADER WITH STUDENTS PARENTS WHO ARE REIMAGINING CAL WORKS. FOLLOWED BY KAREN ROY DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AND SHARON MARDALE TRAY HO DIRECTOR OF THE MERCED MARIPOSA REGIONAL DEPARTMENT. OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES DIRECTOR KILGORE PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND SEVEN MEMBERS I IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO TALK ABOUT CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM IN SOME OF THE ADVANCEMENTS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN OUR SYSTEMS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND THIS IS A CONTINUATION AND I'M PLAN- PLEASED TO BRING THIS IN FRONT OF YOU OF A SERIES OF EFFORTS THAT WE'VE BEEN MOVING TOWARDS TO PRIORITIZE FAMILIES- AND THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM THE COLLECTIONS WE RECEIVED AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE GOT THE FAMILIES FIRST BEFORE. ANY GOVERNMENT- DEBT THIS PARTICULAR PIECE HERE- COMES AFTER A CHANGE TO OUR DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT DISTRIBUTION POLICIES WHICH PRIORITIZES FAMILIES FIRST SO RESOURCES COMING IN FROM THE IRS AND OTHERS LIKE THAT GO TO FAMILY DEBT FOR IT AND- I RECOUP GOVERNMENT AFTERWARDS. WITHIN WORKED WITH DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES TO INCREASE THE PASSED THROUGH FOR FIFTY DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST. WE'VE GOT NOW ONE MONTH UNDER OUR BELT TO START TO EXPLORE AND ANALYZE THE RESULTS OF THAT IMPACT THIS PIECE BEFORE YOU TODAY IS ABOUT PASSING THROUGH- ALL THE COLLECTIONS RECEIVE UP FORMALLY ASSISTED CASES- IT COMES WITH AN IMPACT TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS- BUT- OF A- LITTLE LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BUT THE IMPACT OF THE FAMILIES IS AN INCREASE OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GOING OUT. FAMILIES IN IT DIDN'T IT RESULTS IN ALL COLLECTIONS THAT ARE RECEIVED ON PAST DUE CHILD SUPPORT PASSING TO THE FAMILY'S IN WE WOULD. NO LONGER CLICK THAT AND CURRENT SUPPORT. ONE OF THE- IN HERE ABOUT WHY THE MINISTRY CHOSE TO ONLY- PAST- MAY THIS CHANGE THE FORMALLY. IT AND ARE SEVERAL. OF INTO THAT. WE HAD A PRETTY. CONVERSE OF CALL. ONE THIS. THAT MOVED FORWARD PASSING THROUGH- COLLECTIONS ON CURRENT SUPPORT CASES CASES WITH AN OBLIGATION DURING THE CURRENT MONTH- AND THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS AND THEY ARE PASSING THAT THROUGH THEIR SEEING GREAT RESULTS FROM THAT. WHAT THEY DIDN'T DO IS PASSED THROUGH THE FORMALLY ASSISTED SIDE OF THE HOUSE SO THAT THEY- THAT THE CHILD TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CURRENT MONTH. IT ROLLS OVER BECOMES ARREARS A PAST DUE CHILD SUPPORT WHEN THAT IS COLLECTED ITS RECOUP TO RETAIN IN ITS ENTIRETY TO THE GOVERNMENT- IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THEY'VE SUGGESTED THAT HAVING TO DO IT OVER AGAIN. THEY WOULD HAVE STARTED WITH THE REAR. OF THE HOUSE AND. THEN MOVED TO CURRENT SUPPORT AFTERWARDS. SECONDLY A WE HAVE. TO OUR FEDERAL. SO ON THE PASTOR AND DISREGARD. AND ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ON CURRENT SUPPORT IS THE FEDERAL MAXIMUMS AT THIS POINT IN TIME. IF WE WERE TO GO ABOVE THAT. WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOLE FOR ANY SORT OF PASSED THROUGH- RECRUITMENT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE RETAINED BUT DIDN'T. IN IN FAVOR OF PASSING UP WITH FAMILIES. THE THIRD PIECES ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE OF THINGS- WE JUST BARELY- IMPLEMENTED TO INCREASE TO ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND WE REALLY THANK OUR PARTNERS AND FORMER SOCIAL SERVICES LIKE FOR. HELPING US GET THAT DONE WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO ANALYZE THE IMPACTS OF THAT. WERE WE TO THEN GO AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD WITH FULL PASSED AT THIS POINT TIME. OUR IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE WOULD BE QUITE A WAYS OUT AND GIVEN- AND SYSTEM CHANGES AND- THE CENTRALIZATION SYSTEM. OUR SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE THROUGH. SUPPORT AND THAT'S A PRESS TAG OF A HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS TO THE STATE AND AS SUCH AS KEEPING THAT IN MIND IT WAS ONE THE QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED. UNDER THE IMAGE EXPECT LECTIONS- THE NUMBER PAYING. TO INCREASE- IN OUR BUT WE WENT TO. SEEING THEIR FOR THE- FEW THE IMPACT TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF ABOUT. A LITTLE LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. BUT IF TRAINS FOLLOW SIMILAR TO WHAT COLORADANS EXPERIENCED OUR COLLECTIONS WOULD GO UP KNOWING THAT WHEN FAMILIES ARE PAYING THE CHILD BUT THEY KNOW THAT THAT MONEY IS GOING TO GO OVER TO THE OTHER FAMILY INSTEAD OF RECOUP BY GOVERNMENT- I THINK THERE'S THIS AMERICAN HERITAGE- APPRECIATION OF THE FACT THAT THEY- FAMILY MEMBERS GOING TO GET THIS MONEY AND SO. FOLKS ARE MORE INCLINED TO PAY THE CHILD SUPPORT. THE SECOND BULLET I'M HERE IS REALLY ABOUT THE DECREASE OF A HUNDRED AND- THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSISTANCE COLLECTIONS AND THE DECREASE OF FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A NON SYSTEMS- WHETHER. YOU'LL SEE IN THE BUDGET THERE'S A DECREASE ON THE US RECOUP INSIDE THERE ISN'T- THAT IS THEN SHIFTED OVER TO THE TO THE PAINTER TO THE FAMILY SIR. THAT KIND OF OFFSETS BUT THERE IS A DECLINE IN OVERALL FOR COLLECTIONS FOR THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. THIS IS DISTANCE WHAT BECAUSE OF- THE PANDEMIC AND THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WERE PUT OUT TO FAMILIES THROUGHOUT EMPLOYMENT. DOES HAVE TAPERED OFF OR OR INDEED AND SO THOSE COLLECTION AVENUES ARE NO LONGER THERE. THAT CREATED A SPIKE IN COLLECTIONS- WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A RETURNS TO WHAT WE WOULD MORE CONSISTENTLY EXPECT TO SEE FROM CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. HAVE BEEN OUR PREVIOUS TRANSMIT BUT STILL SEE A CONTINUED OR A STEADY INCREASE OCTOBER COLLECTIONS AND SAID THE SPIKE IN THE DROP BACK. DOWN TO INCREASES THEIR- I CAN. QUESTION THREE PER SECOND AND JUST JUMP TO. NUMBER ON THE L. C. AND USED TO THE- CRIME. FOR THE CHILD'S FOR THE FOR THE RED ACT WE- RETURN. OR RE IMPLEMENTED THE FIFTH SIX NINE DOLLARS THAT PULLED. IN AN EFFORT TO BALANCE OUT THE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. THIS MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO BE AND IS BEING UTILIZED FOR INCREASES IN STAFFING RESOURCES TO BRING ALL OF OUR LOCAL CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES. UP TO AN EVEN PLAYING FILD WHEN IT RATE WHEN IT COMES TO PAYING FOR OR PROVIDING CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. ASSEMBLY LOCAL CHALFORDAGENCIES ARE WORKING ON THIS THOUGH I WILL ADMIT THERE AND THEY WILL ADMIT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT STRUGGLES RIGHT NOW COMING OUT OF PANDEMIC. I'M TRYING TO GET. ADDITIONAL WORK FOR SOME BOARD AND AS BEEN A CHALLENGE NOT JUST FOR CHILD SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL- MANY EVEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO. THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THE GROWING PAINS WITH RETIREMENTS AND- RECRUITMENT EFFORTS THAT UTILIZE THAT BUT- IT IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED USED IMPLEMENT NEW PROGRAMS IT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR. THE INCREASE HIRED. HIRING STAFF. PERSON. YOU WANT TO COVER THREE AND FIVE FROM. THANK YOU KILGORE. I FIND NUMBER. FOUR WITH. THE CLUB. OF OUR STATE. SO WE HAVE A ADDITIONAL PIECE OF TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- WHICH IS TIED COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL. TAX ABILITY EFFICIENCY AND MODERNIZATION AND CHILD SUPPORT I DON'T RULE. I CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A COMPLIANCE DEADLINE FOR COMING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAST ASPECTS OF THIS FEDERAL REGULATION. SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE HAVE OUT PLAYED OUT. A CHANGES TO STATUTES. OF MANY OF WHICH ARE TECHNICAL IN NATURE TO BRING US INTO. LINE WITH THOSE. FOR EXAMPLE CODIFYING AND- ASPECTS THAT ARE ALREADY PART OF CALIFORNIA'S LONGSTANDING CASE LAW. THERE IS SUPPORT FOR EXAMPLE SB TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I JUDICIAL COUNCIL REPORT ON THE REVIEW AT THAT GUY NINE. WHAT YOU COURAGE'S. THE STATE TO CODIFY THESE MATTERS TO KIND OF COMPLIANCE. FINAL. THE FUND RULE DOES NOT A FOLK ON APPEARANCE THE BILL TO HEY AT BOTH. ABILITY TO PAY WHEN ESTADO AN- AND ALSO LOOK TO HEY YOU. THE ORDER SO SOME OF THE OUR OF ARE A- THE PLACE FOR. BURKE CHANGE TO EAST OF SEVERAL- IT TURNS OUT THAT IT TO. WE NEED TO CLOSE. WHEN IT IS HER BEST TO UTILIZE IN EACH. OR IN. FOR PARENTS ATKINS GOALS. FORCED SO THIS DESPERATE SOME CHECK J. THAT ARE GENERALLY AGAIN THAT ARE PART OF LAW CALIFORNIA. IN MANY CPAS CHANGE TO. THAT ARE YOU BY ROCK CHILDS HE- RELATED TO APRIL. NO WAY REGARD TO THIS WEEK UNDER TO. A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGE ROP- THIS DECEMBER. WE ENGAGE WITH A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS AFTER THE LEGISLATURE. BUDGET AND REYES POLICY COMMITTEE INVITED THE TO A- VARIOUS. WE ALSO IN ALL LIKE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY. AND A LARGE GROUP OF ADVOCATES. WORK IN THE INCLUDING EXAMPLE BACKGROUND THE WESTMINSTER AMMAN FIVE. AS PART OF IT EACH WEEK AND JUSTICE TALK WISH PUBLISHING EIGHT MARCH OF FIFTY. I'M HOSTED THREE MEETING WHERE WE WALKED THROUGH OUR- VARIOUS. IN THE REGULATION AND COMPARED TO OUR- CURRENT STATUTORY AND LAW SHOW WHERE WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE CHANGE. WE ARE FOR. AND INPUT AB RIGHT NOW COMMENTS. AND THEN THE FINAL BILL USED AND DRAFT ON THAT OF FINANCE WEBSITE CORPORATE THOSE. I REQUEST THAT THOSE THAT CASE IS ALWAYS GO TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OPERATES THAT HE GOT FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. WE ALSO RECEIVED RECEIVED FEEDBACK MEMBERS OF THAT COALITION IN TERMS THAT THE ASPECTS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN SETTING UP PERCEPTION OF SUPPORT. INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT WOULD MAKE THEM REPORTS TWENTY CHANGES BASED ON THOSE COMMENTS- THE LAST QUESTION HERE WAS REGARDING COLLECTOR. STUDY THAT WAS PASSED AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. UNLESS I PUT THE BILL HE STUDIED WAS AUTHORIZED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT. I CHANGED YOUR LOG THAT WOULD PERMIT US TO CATEGORIZE CERTAIN READERS THE GOVERNMENT AS BEING ENTIRELY UNCOLLECTIBLE. THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY TO ADD PROVISION FOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT WHAT ALLOWS US TO COMPROMISE OR REPAIRS WHICH ARE- CHECKED APARTMENT SO IT'S ACCEPTANCE OF A SMALLER AMOUNT IN ORDER TO BRAVE THE LARGER AMOUNTS FOR REPAIRS. AND IT'S AGAIN COMPLEMENT YOUR TO THE CHANGE FOR THIS YEAR I IN ORDER TO. THE SELECT ACTUALLY NEED TO THE FAMILY RATHER THAN. THEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S. WE HAVE STARTED WORK ON THE AND TRY TO CHECK AND ASPECTS ABOUT OUR STATE MY OF WORK. AND WE HAVEN'T WITH THAT YOU CAL ANALYTICS PANEL OFFICE. AS LITTLE SERVER SHOPS WERE IS TO ASK OUR- THINGS THAT WHICH- BESIDES THE FACT THAT WERE ACTORS DID NOT STATURE. I WE ARE YOU TO. OUR YOU. ONE OF OUR KEY UNIVERSAL. THERE ARE MANY EXCELLENT OPTIONS IN THIS AND WE ARE TO WITH DIFFERENT UNIVERSITY TO DO THAT WORK FOR US. IMPLEMENTS THE FLEXIBLE THAT PROVISIONS RIGHT JANUARY AT ONE TWENTY TWENTY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR JULIA BAKER WITH THE OF. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBER TO THE BACK WITH A OF NO ADDITIONAL AT THE TIME THANK YOU STILL WITH THE HELLO. THANK YOU THIS IS JACKET HERE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE I'M YEAR AGENDA MENTIONS THREE KEEP BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AND I'LL JUST GO THROUGH EACH OF THEM AND HIGHLIGHT DARK MAJOR TAKE AWAYS. THE FIRST ONE BEING- ADOPTING A FULL PASS THROUGH POLICY FOR PAYMENTS COLLECTED FOR FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES AND WHAT THIS MEANS ESSENTIALLY IS. WHEN EIGHT PM WE SIGNED UP FOR CAO WORKS- WE REQUIRED THEM TO SIGN OVER A PORTION OF THEIR CHILD SUPPORT TO THE STATE SO THAT WE CAN ESSENTIALLY REIMBURSE OURSELVES FOR THE CARROTS CACHET THAT FAMILIES RECEIVING- AND WE- COLLECT COLLECT THAT WHILE THEY'RE RECEIVING CAL WORKS HOWEVER- IF THERE'S A MISSED PAYMENT AND WE WEREN'T ABLE TO REIMBURSE OURSELVES FOR THAT MONTH. WE KEEP TRACK OF THAT AMOUNT WHICH THEN GOES TO GOVERNMENT- THAT SO EVEN ONCE THE FAMILY LEAVES CAL WORKS OR THE CHILD I'M REACHES ADULTHOOD WE STILL SEEK PAYMENT ON THAT PASS DO GOVERNMENT BOWED- DEBT ARREARS. I'M SO BUT THEY'VE GOT BURKE IS ANY PAIN THAT ARE COLLECTED. FOR THAT PAST DUE GOVERNMENT. DECK INSTEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT RETAINING IT WE'RE JUST GONNA LET FORMER QARAX FAMILY KEEP THAT MONEY- AS MENTIONED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS MAXIMIZES FEDERAL FLEXIBILITIES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THIS WITHOUT HAVING TO REIMBURSE THEM. FOR THEIR SHARE OF- CAL WORKS RECOUP MEANT- HOWEVER IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSAL WE DO NOTE THAT THIS STILL MAINTAINS A DIFFERENCE AND THE PASTOR OF BROWN'S. RETWEET CURRENT AND FORMER CAL LOOKS FAMILIES SPECIFICALLY THE STATE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD STILL BE EIGHT WOULD STILL BE RETAINING A PERSON AT A PORTION OF COUNT OF CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS MADE FOR CURRENT POWER XPM LEASE TO REIMBURSE ITSELF BACK FOR CALVERT'S CASH AID. OVERALL WE BELIEVE THAT THE PASSED THROUGH FRAMEWORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY DECIDES TO ADOPTION REALLY REFLECTS THAT IT'S PROGRAM GOALS. I'M FOR EXAMPLE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THAT THE INTENT IS TO STABILIZE THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES- BUT SPECIFICALLY IT'S ONLY LIMITED TO FORMER CAT WORKS FAMILIES BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT CURRENT COVERAGE FAMILIES. ALSO EXPERIENCE- ALSO HAVE REPORTED INCOME OUTLOOK HAVE ALSO HAVE REPORTED INCOME LEVELS THAT ARE VERY VERY WELL SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO MINIMIZE THE PAST YOUR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CURRENT AND FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES. AND MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT ARE RECEIVING ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS. IT COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING A FULL PASSED HROUGH FOR BOTH FORMER AND CURRENT COLLEAGUES FAMILIES. OVERALL THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN I'M THINKING ABOUT WHAT PASSED THROUGH REMARK- IT WOULD WANT TO ADOPT INCLUDE PROPERLY TO EACH CHANGE BE IMPLEMENTED AS AS WAS REFERENCE BY THE ADMINISTRATION. ANY PASTOR CHANGES FOR CURRENT CAO WORKS FAMILIES LIKELY COULD NOT BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL SOMETIME IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE JUST DUE TO ACT YOU AUTOMATION CHALLENGES. ANOTHER THING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER THOUGH IS WHETHER ANY AUTOMATION PLANNING ACTIVITIES COULD BEGIN NOW- IN ORDER TO BETTER ENSURE THE EARLIEST IMPLEMENTATION DATE. OF ANY PASTOR CHANGES IT WOULD WANT TO ADOPT A CART CAL WORKS FAMILIES. AND OF COURSE ADDITIONAL COST TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE TO SUPPLEMENT OR ADD ON I'M TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO DO A FULL PASSED THROUGH. FOR FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES. LASTLY WE DO NOTE THAT- IN INCREASING THE PASTOR AMOUNTS FOR CURRENT AND FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER THAT WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY. FOR THAT FAMILY WHEN IT COMES TO. OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS AND HOW WOULD WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE SECOND A BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT'S LAID OUT IN THE AGENDA- REFERS TO A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING FOR LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES- THIS ESSENTIALLY IT BUILDS UPON A MAP AT ALL A FUNDING METHODOLOGY THAT WAS CONSTRUCTED BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE L. C. SA FUNDING METHODOLOGY AND THAT IT DOES NOT INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES- THAT COULD ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING COST PRESSURES AND FREE OF EXISTING FUNDS- BUT ALSO WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE LCC FUNDING METHODOLOGY. DOES NOT REFLECT ACTUAL FUNDING NEEDS I'M GIVEN THAT IT IS BASED OFF OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OPERATION LEVELS. HOWEVER SINCE THEN SO MUCH HAS CHANGED BUT THE PROGRAM OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF COVIC BUT ALSO- WE ANTICIPATE EVEN FUTURE CHANGES TO OPERATIONS LEVELS AS WE SEEK TO COMPLY WITH THE RECENT FEDERAL WORK REQUIREMENTS- BASED OFF OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INTRODUCED. SO WITH THAT SAID WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOT PROVIDING YOU FUTURE- FUNDING INCREASES UNTIL THE ADMINISTRATION. SAYS IT'S FUNDING METHODOLOGY TO ADDRESS THOSE IDENTIFIED SHORTCOMINGS SOME OF THE CHANGES ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND COULD BE ADDED TO THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY RELATIVELY QUICKLY. LIKE LIMITING THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS ADJUSTMENTS- TO A FIXED RATE DOOR ADDING AN ON GOING PROCESS IN WHICH BUDGETS FOR OVER FUNDED L. CSAS. ARE INCREMENTALLY REDUCED OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN THOSE EXCESS FUNDS ARE REDISTRIBUTED. TO UNDERFUNDED ALSO USING. OTHER POSSIBLE CHANGES INCLUDE USING ANY ADDITIONAL FUTURE FUNDING TO SUPPORT STAFFING MODELS ARE SERVICE MODELS THAT SPECIFICALLY ALIGNED. WITH LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM GOALS. THE LAST PROPOSALS IN AT PROPOSAL THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO. I'M TO CHANGE ROLE IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE I'VE RESET FEDERAL. WE ARE STILL COMPLETING OUR ANALYSIS OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUT TWO THINGS THAT I WOULD JUST POINT OUT IN TERMS OF THINGS THAT WERE CONSIDERING INCLUDE. ONE WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT MORE DETAILED LANGUAGE AND DEFINITIONS AROUND ANY NEW CRITERIA THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTABLISHING A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER OR DETERMINING IF PARENTS ABILITY TO PAY. IN ORDER TO ENSURE A STANDARDIZED APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW CRITERIA AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT FOR ALL FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY SIMILAR TO THE QUESTION THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA- WE ALSO RAISE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE PROPOSED CHANGES BETTER SUITED TO BE CONSIDERED THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS RELATIVE TO THE BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MIKE HERALD WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. EXCUSE ME MR JERRY BEFORE WE CONTINUE ON IN THE AGENDA ETCETERA IF- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE- DEPARTMENT HAS A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THE LATEST RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WOULD BE OKAY PLEASE PROCEED. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADD TO THE BAKER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS THE L. A. AS RECOMMENDATION TO WITHHOLD FUNDING TO LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES- THERE MANY LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES THAT REMAIN UNDERFUNDED. AND OUR GOAL WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS TO FIRST ADDRESS THE DISPARITY OF FUNDING AND TO THE IDENTIFIED COUNTIES AND BRING THEM TO PARITY I'M BEFORE WE REVISIT THE FUNDING CALCULATOR FOR ON GOING FUNDING PURPOSES. AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO THE DEPARTMENT CAN PROVIDE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION. ON WHAT THIS FUNDING IS STILL NEEDED. THAT'S OKAY AT THIS POINT WE WILL CONTINUE THE PANEL AND THEN TAKE ANY MEMBER QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM MIKE HERALD WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THINK ABOUT OUR STATE. THINK ABOUT OUR STATE'S CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM- THANK YOU THEY ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE THIS IN PLACE SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF THESE IN SITUATIONS ARE GETTING ENOUGH CASH ASSISTANCE ENOUGH MONEY IN THEIR LIVES SO THAT YOU KNOW THEY CAN HAVE THE BASIC NECESSITIES OF LIFE- THAT- YOU KNOW WE PUT WE YOU KNOW WE WERE VERY DEMANDING OF NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS WE THOUGHT WE WOULD PUT A GREATER BURDEN ON THEM TO- TO PROVIDE THEIR- COULD CHUCK OF THEIR RESOURCES THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW LARGE AWARDS TO BE. IT'S A BIT OF A MAJOR POLICY DISCUSSION THAT WE SHOULD BE HAVING- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN I TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THAT THE CHILDREN NEVER ARE GETTING VERY LITTLE OF THE CHILD SUPPORT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GO TO THE KIDS. PEOPLE LOOK AT ME LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ABOUT CAN'T BE AND I GO NO ACTUALLY THE WAY OUR SYSTEM WORKS IS THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TAKE THE MONEY. END USER TO RE IN THEM FOR THE CLOCK PROVIDE WELFARE BENEFITS. ANIMO CASES ONLY A PORTION IN THE BACK CASE ONLY A PORSCHE OF THE CHILD. HEY ACTUALLY GO THE PAN. THAT THE CHILDREN WHO NEED- THIS. IS REALLY CAL INTUITIVE I THINK MOST PEOPLE THE RELEASE TO LEARN WE ALL THE THIS TO- MAKE NOCTIS A REAL. MEET THEIR OBLIGATION. AND THE OTHER THING OF THE DAY THE MONEY REALLY DOES NOT GO TO THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES OF STATE BACK. I WANTED ACKNOWLEDGE START OFF LIKE KNOWLEDGE GENE. THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORTH HERE- NEED MINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. THEY ARE PROPOSING THE IN THIS POLICY AND ACTUALLY PASS THROUGH THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS THAT PARENTS MADE. TO THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE WALL ALL THE WAY ALONG. AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP THAT WE ALL NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THIS MONTH I NEED OF THE KIDS. AND AFTER WORLD TRYING TO DO HERE RIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE. THE KIDS DON'T LIVE IN POVERTY AND DESTITUTION AND YET OUR POLICY YOUR TO FOR HAS BEEN. PRIORITIZE THANK. NEEDS OVER THE NEEDS THE CHILD. SO YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT WHAT THE GUY HAS PROPOSED HERE. WE ALSO SUPPORT WHAT THE A. OWNERS JUST READ HOWEVER WHICH IS THAT WE SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE A FULL PASS THROUGH. FOR THE CURRENT CALLOUS CASES- AS THE L. A. L. NOTED IN MOST CASES. BUT THE FAMILY DOG HOW WORKS ARE. BENEFIT WHO ARE OPPENHEIMER CASE THE FAMILY OF FORMER KING. TO THE NEEDS OF EACH ARE GROWN. THEY NEED MONEY NOW. NOT IN THE THE ALL FIRST TWENTY YEARS THE TIME FOR CONTINUING TO DELAY THAT. IS COMMANDANT WE NEED TO EXPAND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCLUDE ALL THE CURRENT CAL WORST CASE. SO THAT THOSE FAMILIES ALSO GET THE ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED. NOW COLORADO HAS ALREADY DONE THAT. AND I THINK EVEN OUR DIRECTOR KILGORE MAY MENTION THIS IN HIS REMARKS AND CRESCENTA COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT WORKING WITH OUR COALITION ON THESE EFFORTS AND REDUCE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER BOB I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT THE COLORADO PILOT THAT WOULD POP RATED IS SHOWING REMARKABLE RESULTS. AND ENSURE. PRETTY SIMPLE- WHEN NON CRYPTO PARENTS THE RICH. AND NOT TO THE GOVERNMENT. THE PARENTS PAY MORE AND THEY PAY MORE OFTEN. SO WE IN COLORADO WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES BUT BELIEVE ONE STUDY CITED THAT THERE WAS 76% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PARENTS WHO PAY AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND OF THOSE WHO PAID THE FAMILY GOT OUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS MORE A MONTH IN INCOME. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR A VERY VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND THE FAMILIES WHO ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY CALIFORNIA. PROGRAM'S REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE- AND SO WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO FIND A WAY TO PASS THROUGH ALL THE CHILD SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT CASES WE ALSO WOULD ENCOURAGE. YOU TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IT YOU'RE UNFORTUNATE HAVE TO CHOOSE BASED ON THE BUDGET CONCERN. YOU KNOW WE WOULD PRIORITIZE THE CURRENT CASES FIRST BECAUSE WE THINK THE NEEDS OF THOSE FAMILIES ARE GREATER. BUT WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT WE CAN BE ABLE. AND ONE LAST THING WE WOULD JUST SAY ABOUT CHILD SUPPORT. IF WE WANT NON PARENTS TO PAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT OF WORK AND GENERATE INCOME. WE SPEND A LOT OF DRIVERS LICENSES OF NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS TO RENT ARREARS RIGHT NOW. AND MANY OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE POOR. SO TAKING AWAY THEIR LICENSE MEANS THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO WORK THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. WE SHOULD BE VERY NARROWLY APPLYING THIS LICENSE SUSPENSION REQUIREMENTS ONLY ON PARENTS WHOSE INCOME WE KNOW. AB DEVELOPMENT THE PAYMENT WE'RE NOT MAKING. GOING AFTER LOW LOW IN- INTO. THAT'S A SPENDING BILL AND JUST MAKES WORSE. THANK YOU MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ANY SIX AND THE SOFT LAURIE PARENT LEADER WITH THE STUDENT'S PARENTS WHO ARE REIMAGINING CAL WORKS ALSO KNOWN AS S. P. R. A C. PLEASE BEGIN.

ALL THANK YOU AND YOU DID GREAT. NEXT WE'LL HEAR KAREN REUTER OF THE CENTER TO OF TO SERVICES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHARITY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO BE APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF THE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY. IN CALIFORNIA AND A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I AM TRULY GRATEFUL I WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY IN MY COMMENTS. WE HAVE A COMMON PROBLEMS AND I AM COMMITTED TO THE WORK OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ERADICATE POVERTY. AND ADDRESS INTRUSIVE POLICIES THAT CREATE AN EQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND I AM NOT ALONE. THE PEOPLE THAT IT IS TO THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM CHAIR ABOUT THE FAMILIES WE SERVE EVERY DAY WE STRIVE TO HONOR THE MISSION TO FIGHT POVERTY AND INEQUALITY. I EMPOWERING PARENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR REMAIN SIGNIFICANT HOW WE DELIVER THOSE SERVICES NEEDS TO KEEP PACE WITH FAMILIES TODAY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS HAS SET THE RIGHT TONE. OR IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGES GUIDED BY THE FEDERAL LAW AND I AM EXCITED TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES. WITH YOUR HELP AND LEADERSHIP THE ABILITY TO HAVE A MORE OPEN AND RECEPTIVE PROGRAMS THAT IS FLEXIBLE. FAMILY FOCUSED APPROACHABLE TO PARENTS PAYING SUPPORT AND OFFERS CUSTOMIZED INTERVENTIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE. LIKE THE LEGISLATURE I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO PARENTS STORIES AND I AM COMMITTED TO GETTING AS MUCH MONEY TO FAMILIES LIKE. 101% CONCERT TO FAMILIES PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES. REMOTES RACIAL EQUITY AND IS TRANSFORMATIVE FOR CHILDREN. BUT IF YOU ASKED ME TODAY IF MY AGENCY HAS THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO TRANSFORM OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES I HAVE TO SAY NO. THE FEDERAL LAW HAS CHANGED AND EVERY COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY NEEDS TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION TOGETHER. THE FACT EVERY COUNTY IS NOT FINANCIALLY ABLE TO MAKE THIS MOMENT WE NEED YOUR HELP. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES ACROSS OUR STATE ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN AND CONTINUE BASS LINE SERVICES AS WE EMERGE FROM THE CULVERT CARE ACT. INDIVIDUALIZED PARENT LED CASE MANAGEMENT WITH HOLISTIC REMEDIES TO BARRIERS THAT REFLECT OUR CLIENT DEMOGRAPHICS IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. TO GET FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW TO WHERE WE ALL AGREE WE OUGHT TO BE. WE WILL NEED ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE PROMISES MADE PROMISES KEPT. THIS IS A LEADING PROGRAM. THE STATE INVESTMENT TRIGGERS A MATCHING INVESTMENT I ARTWORK FEDERAL PARTNERS SO WE CAN GET THE PROGRAM WE ALL ONCE AND FAMILIES EXPECT. TO GET FROM A TRIP SIX TRANSACTIONAL SYSTEM. TO A TRANSFORMATIONAL FAMILY CENTER PROGRAM IT WILL TAKE A VILLAGE. WE WILL WE WILL NEED LAWS REGULATIONS AUTOMATED SYSTEM CHANGES EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT BUT SUPPORTS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE WHICH- THE TABLE MUST BE SET WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS THAT INCLUDE COUNTY DIRECTORS THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL RULE. SURE EIGHT BEST PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND WE NEED PARENTS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AT THE TABLE TO TELL US IF WE ARE GETTING IT RIGHT.% WE ALL WANT MEANINGFUL CHANGE AS A DIRECTOR. I'M WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I DON'T WANT TO FLEX MUSCLE MEMORY BACK TO THE SAME SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THIRTY YEARS. I NEED THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE TRANSFORMATION FROM THE TOP OF OUR ORGANIZATION TOWARDS IRAQ SERVICE WORKERS. WE MUST DO THIS WORK INTENTIONALLY. AND THOUGHTFULLY IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT HAVE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO THE VERY FAMILIES WE ARE TRYING TO HELP. I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S HOW WE TOGETHER CAN GET SYSTEMIC CHANGE PROMOTING SYSTEMIC RACIAL EQUITY DOES NOT REST SOLELY WITHTHE ACCOUNTABILITY OF BAD ACTORS BUT WITH A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE COLLECTIVE SYSTEM OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES I PROGRAM LEADERSHIP. WHEREVER WE SET. WE NEED TO DO THIS WORK IN BOLD AND COURAGEOUS WAYS TO UNDO INSTITUTIONAL. AND STRUCTURAL RACISM. TO MAKE A PARADIGM SHIFT SERVICES SUCH AS GREATER LANGUAGE AND PROGRAM ACCESS SO PARENTS FEEL TRULY HEARD AND INCARCERATED PARENTS RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE AS SOMEONE WALKING INTO OUR OFFICE. EXPANSION OF OUR SERVICES TO INCLUDE NON MONETARY ORDERS. BROADENING THE REACH OF ACCESS OR VISITATION BASED ON ITS VALUE TO INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES AND LEARNING FROM CALIFORNIA'S TRIBAL NATIONS TO PROVIDE PARENTS. WITH THE OPTION TO DEVELOPING HIGH ORDERS THAT OUR PARENTS. I'LL TRULY VALUABLE HONORS EXTENDED FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS. AND BUILDING ON EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS TO PROMOTE POSITIVE CO PARENTING RELATIONSHIPS. THROUGH PARENTING TIME ORDERS. WE NEED THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE TRANSFORMATION FROM THE TOP OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS TO OUR DIRECT SERVICE WORKERS. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW WE EAT TOGETHER GET TO A REAL CHANGE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SHARON MARDALE TRAY HO THE DIRECTOR. FOR THE MERCED MARIPOSA REGIONAL DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR ARAMBULA AN HONOR TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M I'M SHARON WARDELL TRAY HO THE DIRECTOR OF THE MERCED MARIPOSA REGIONAL TRANSPORT AGENCY AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AS A DIRECTOR OF LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY. OFFERS A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT MY ORGANIZATION MY DEPARTMENT ASSIST OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND CASES IN BOTH RURAL AND MOUNTAIN REGIONS WITH HIGH POVERTY LEVELS AND PUBLIC ASSISTANCE CASELOADS 21% OF OUR CASELOAD IS CURRENTLY ASSISTED AND 66% BEING FORMALLY ASSISTED. THIS PAST YEAR WE COLLECTED OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH NEARLY 70% OF THOSE COLLECTIONS GOING DIRECTLY TO THE FAMILIES WE SERVE WE SERVE IN OUR CURRENT COMMUNITIES ABOUT ONE IN SEVEN FAMILIES WITH A NATIONAL RATIO ABOUT ONE IN FIVE BEING SERVED SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING OUR SERVICES TO A GREATER COMMUNITY THAT IS IN NEED. LIKE MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE FOR SAN FRANCISCO I THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR THESE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL ST FOR THE PROPOSED BUDGET TO GIVE OUR LOCAL AGENCIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO MAXIMIZE THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN A TIME WHEN SERVICES WITH GOALS OF REDUCING POVERTY AND CREATING STABILITY ARE SO VERY ESSENTIAL WILL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RECOMMENDING FULL PASSER OF COLLECTIONS ON FORMALLY ASSISTED CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS. PROMOTE CHILD AND FAMILY STABILIZATION. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFIC TO FULL PASSER OF ARREARS COLLECTION ON FORMALLY ASSISTED CASES BUILDS UPON AS- DIRECTED KILGORE DIMENSIONED BUILDS UPON PRIOR LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FAMILIES AS THEY ARE LESS RELIANT ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM IS A STARK THIRD LARGEST POVERTY PREVENTION PROGRAM IN THE STATE AND PASSING THE ARREARS COLLECTIONS THREE TO FAMILIES WILL HELP THEM CREATE GREATER STABILITY. REPRESENTING TO COUNTIES BOTH RURAL AMOUNT COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH PUBLIC ASSISTANCE CASELOADS THIS PROPOSAL WILL HAVE A MEANINGFUL AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR IMMEDIATE COMMUNITIES. IN MERCED COUNTY OF THE ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS DISTRIBUTED LAST YEAR IS A REARS OR PAST DUE CHILD SUPPORT. EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION OR ABOUT 73% WAS DISTRIBUTED TO FORMERLY ASSISTED CASES. BASED UPON CURRENT DISTRIBUTION HIERARCHY ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WENT TO FORMALLY ASSISTED FAMILIES SKEWS ME ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WAS COLLECTED WENT DIRECTLY TO FORMALLY ASSISTED FAMILIES. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ALL OF THOSE DOLLARS WOULD GO TO THE FAMILIES STRENGTHENING THEIR FINANCIAL SECURITY AND MINIMAP MINIMIZING THAT RISK OF LIVING IN POVERTY. WHILE INCREASING MONEY TO FAMILIES AS NOTED BY ADMINISTRATION THIS PROPOSAL IS WITHIN ALLOWABLE FEDERAL GUIDELINES SO LOW OR MINIMAL COST TO THE STATE. THOUGH THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CAN BENEFIT FAMILIES IT'S ALSO COMPLICATED AND STARTING WITH THE FORMERLY ASSISTED ARREARS IS A GOOD PLAC TO START. MANY OF THESE FAMILIES MAY BE RECEIVING A VARIETY OF NEEDS BASED SERVICES FROM FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS. EVALUATING IT FOR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR IMPACTS THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY MAY HAVE ON THE FAMILIES ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WILL BE NECESSARY. ANOTHER QUESTION IN THE AGENDA WAS HOW DOES FINALIZATION OF THE MANDATES OF THE FEDERAL FINAL ROLE IMPACT LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT OPERATIONAL PROGRAMS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE FOR FEDERAL FINAL RULE WILL ENABLE LOCAL AGENCIES TO CREATE ORDERS THAT ACCURATELY REFLECT AN INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CAN MINIMIZE ARREARS DEBT AND THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH ALLOWING PAST DUE CHILD SUPPORT. THE CALIFORNIA CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM ALREADY CONSIDERS A PARENT'S ABILITY TO PAY AN ACTUAL EARNINGS WHEN ESTABLISHING A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER THE FEDERAL FINAL RULES FOCUS TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF A STANDARD PRESUMED INCOME ABOUT. REQUIRES LOCAL AGENCIES TO ENHANCE THEIR ESTABLISHMENT PROCESS AND CONSIDER OTHER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS A PARENTS LOCATION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HISTORY AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS TO NAME A FEW. THESE MANDATES WILL CREATE CONSISTENCY AND SERVICES PROVIDED ACROSS THE STRAIT THE STATE AND CREATE GREATER SYSTEMIC EQUITY TO THOSE WE SERVE. IMPLEMENTING THE MANDATES OF THE FEDERAL FINAL RULE WILL GIVE LOCA AGENCIES FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH BOTH PARENTS TOGETHER THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION. CHILDREN IN OUR PROGRAM WILL ALSO BENEFIT FROM THESE NEW ESTABLISHMENT PROCESSES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ESTABLISH OF ESTABLISHING ORDERS THAT ARE BASED UPON INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF PAYMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT. CONSISTENT CHARGE PER PAYMENTS WILL BE SOMETHING THE FAMILY CAN RELY UPON EACH MONTH HELPING TO CREATE A STABLE HOUSEHOLD AND THEN THERE IS THE POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT THE CHILD. KNOWING THAT THEIR PARENT IS PAYING TO SUPPORT THEIR FINANCIAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT THEM. AS CALIFORNIA'S CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM IS PROGRESSIVE HAVING ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THE MANDATES OF THE FEDERAL FINAL RULE MOVING FORWARD I BELIEVE AS A STATEWIDE PROGRAM WE WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS NECESSARY ATTENTION. TO THE TOPIC OF SYSTEMIC EQUITY AND SEEK SOLUTIONS FOR POTENTIAL INEQUITIES. OPERATIONALLY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL FINAL RULE- A SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD FOR EVERY LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY STATEWIDE. TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THESE NEW MANDATES WILL REQUIRE CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND MORE RESOURCES WILL BE NECESSARY. WHAT IMPACT WILL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAVE ON CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM ABILITY TO PROMOTE CHILD AND FAMILY STABILIZATION. AT THE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED AND IS ANTICIPATING RECEIVING INCREASED FUNDS I AM GRATEFUL AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR AND DEPARTMENTS EFFORTS IN PREVIOUS SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET SEEKS A TWENTY POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS STATES GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION TO ASSIST THE UNDER FUNDED LOCAL AGENCIES. THESE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE FUNDING DISPARITY BETWEEN LOCAL AGENCIES WITHOUT THESE FUNDS LOCAL AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO ENSURE PARITY OF CURRENT SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. HAVING SAID THAT. THE CURRENT FUNDING METHODOLOGY WAS BASED UPON HOW WE OPERATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WITH THE FEDERAL FINAL RULE MANDATES EVERY LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY REGARDLESS OF ADEQUATE ADEQUACY OF FUNDING WILL BE REQUIRED TO DO MORE COMPREHENSIVE ACTIVITIES AND THIS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO GATHER AND EVALUATE NEW INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED. WHEN ESTABLISHING OR MODIFYING A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER. AN INVESTMENT OF MORE FUNDS WILL BE NECESSARY TO HELP ALL LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES TO ACHIEVE THIS. AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGH THE PANDEMIC RECRUITMENT AND HIRING PROCESS AS OF ARE TAKING LONGER AND AGENCIES STRUGGLE TO FIT FILL VACANCIES. THE FEDERAL FINAL RULE MANDATES WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAM AND TIME IT TAKES TO SUPPORT THE STEEP LEARNING CURVE FOR NEW EMPLOYEES IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT EACH LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY START HIRING TRAINING AND PREPARING FOR THE NEW WAY OF BUSINESS NOW. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS SEEM NON I WILL. KEEP IT HERE WITH THE CHAIR. I WILL BEGIN. AGAIN BY JUST WANTING TO MAKE SURE TO COMPLEMENT A NIECE OF FLORIDA THE PARENT LEADER WHO WE- HEARD EARLIER TODAY WHO WAS SPEAKING ABOUT HER FOUR YEAR OLD SON WHO WANTED TO BE A- RED. POWER RANGER I BELIEVE THAT WAS JASON AND I'M SHOWING TOO MUCH THAT I KNOW ABOUT THE POWER RANGERS. BUT BUT IT HELLO. IT ALLOWED ME TO REALLY CONTEXTUALIZE AND MAKE SURE THAT WERE PLACING THE FAMILIES AT THE CENTER. AND HER SUGGESTION HERE TODAY WAS WHY WE AREN'T HELPING CURRENT FAMILIES AND INSTEAD ARE FOCUSING ON THE FORMER. CASES OF THOSE WHO ARE IN THE SYSTEM AND I'M HOPING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. ON WHY WE WOULD CHOOSE THAT AS WE HEARD FROM. MIKE HERALD IT IS OFTENTIMES THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED. WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEED. I'M WONDERING WHY WE AREN'T PROVIDING THAT SIMILAR PASSED THROUGH FOR THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION DAVID OVERCORRECTED THE DEPARTMENT- IT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT TO THE IDEA THE CONCEPT OF FULL PAST YOU AND I THINK IDEALLY THE PROGRAM DETAILS FOR PROGRAM WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE AT SOME POINT IN TIME- THIS TOPIC A FULL PASSWORD CURRENT SUPPORT WAS BROUGHT UP TWO YEARS AGO. AND THROUGH THE TEACHER THE DISCUSSION NEGOTIATION WITH BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE MINISTRATION- IT WAS AGREED TO MOVE THE DISREGARD FROM FIFTY DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE FULL PAST YEAR. PART OF THAT PROJECT THAT ISSUE WAS THE PRICE TAG PART OF IT WAS WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY TO GO ABOUT THAT WE CAN'T DO FULL PASSED THE WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOLE ON THEIR PIECE IF WE WERE TO DO THAT BECAUSE- AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IS NOT GOING TO WAIT THEIR PORTION OF RECRUITMENT IF WE CHOOSE TO PASS THROUGH THE FUNDS- THROUGH THE WHOLE- THREE ANALYSTS SO ACTING ON A PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT MOVE TO ONE UNDER TWO HUNDRED AND JUST IMPLEMENT THAT IN JANUARY. I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE HOW MUCH OF THAT THE PAYMENTS IS PASSED TO THE FAMILY AND HW MUCH IS RETAIN OFF OF THIS NEW INCREASE THRESHOLD- AND WE HAVE SOME TIME TO DO THAT BECAUSE- THROUGH OUR ANALYSIS OF. OF SYSTEMS WE DON'T FEEL LIKE WE CAN REACH THIS OR GET TO THIS- SYSTEM CHANGE BECAUSE THIS IS A PRETTY MASSIVE ON THE CURRENT SUPPORT SYSTEMS SIDE OF THINGS AS OPPOSED TO THE- FORMER SIDE. WE DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THOSE IMPLEMENTATIONS IN THE SYSTEMS OF TOP TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SO I THINK THIS TOPIC OF CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE- AND WITH MORE DATA AS WE START TO SEE THE IMPACT OF. THE INCREASE PASTOR TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THERE'S NECESSARILY ANY EIGHTY. ISSUE FROM THE S. SO FROM DAY- THE GOVERNOR'S SIDE THAT THAT THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO GO WE'RE JUST NOT SURE THAT WE CAN TACKLE THIS RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT AS WITH FOR. I WOULD APPRECIATE A CHANCE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PORTION IS STATE RECRUITMENT VERSUS FEDERAL RECRUITMENT TO GET A. BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE I. EVENTUALLY ARE MAKING SURE WERE TAKING CARE OF. NEEDS- OVER COVER. NEEDS BUT NOW WOULD TO TRANSIT IF I COULD TO SPEAK LITTLE BIT ABOUT. AND ON TWENTY EIGHT OF THE AGENDA THERE'S A TOTAL OF EIGHTEEN POINT ONE BILLION AND CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS AS OF DECEMBER FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND IT REFERENCES THAT SIX POINT SIX BILLION WAS OWED TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND I'M HOPING TO GET A BIT MORE CLARITY ABOUT WHICH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. TO UNDERSTAND. RESPONSIBILITIES ABOUT WHO'S OWED WHAT ULTIMATELY- I BELIEVE THAT AS WE ARE HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS FROM THE COLLECTABILITY STUDY WE WILL GET TO A POINT WHERE WERE REALLY STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THOSE ARREARS WHICH ARE EITHER COMPROMISED OR DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE AND I'M WONDERING HOW WE CAN EFFECTIVELY. TRANSITION OR MOVE FORWARD TO TAKE THESE OFF OF OUR BALANCE SHEET IF THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE PER THE COLLECTABILITY STUDY AND I'M WONDERING HOW WE CAN DO THAT IN LIGHT OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY. BEING UNDER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GAMBLING AND SO IF I CAN I ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE L. A. O. TO SEE IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD OCCUR TO THE GAM LIMIT IF WE WERE TO. HELP TO RECTIFY THESE ARREARS THAT CURRENTLY ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AND WOULD APPRECIATE A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD REQUESTS FROM THE CHAIR AND THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC REQUEST ON THE AGENDA I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ARE ON PAGE THIRTY OF OUR AGENDA. I'D LIKE TO KINDLY ASK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES TO PLEASE PROVIDE FIRST AN ESTIMATE OF THAT FULL PASS THROUGH OF CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO CURRENTLY ASSISTING CASES WITH THE L. L. ASSISTING US. WITH AN EYE TOWARDS THE FULL PORTRAIT OF COST CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE POLL FULL PASSED THROUGH ALSO WITH THINKING ABOUT OPTIONS FOR A POTENTIAL PHASE AND RELATIVE TO WHAT DIRECTOR KILGORE TO SAID. ABOUT INFORMATION IN TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY FIVE. SECONDS I WOULD LIKE A NARROWER ANALYSIS OF THE STATUTORY CHANGES NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THE FINAL RULE WITH A MEETING WITH KEY LEGISLATIVE STAFF REQUESTED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS THIS. WITH THATI'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR WHICH IS ON CALFRESH AND THE CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND EMERGENCY FOOD THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND OVERSIGHT OVER THESE KEY PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS. WILL HAVE SEVEN PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL WILL BEGIN WITH JENNIFER HERNANDEZ FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT DIVISION DEPUTY DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. FOLLOWED BY TYLER WOODS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE L. A. O. KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. SHANTI PRASAD SENIOR POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. BUT SOBRE EL ESTUDIO SENIOR ADVOCATE FOR NOURISHED CALIFORNIA AND JAKE BRYMER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AIDES COMMISSION. LET'S BEGIN WITH DEPUTY DIRECTOR HERNANDEZ WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA I WILL BEGIN- FIRST WITH THE QUESTION REGARDING- CAL FIRST ADMINISTRATION AND SO- WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH AN UPDATE IN TERMS OF THE STATUS OF WHERE WE ARE- THE STATE AND COUNTY YOUTH WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME OUR ADMIN RE BASING CONVERSATIONS. TO DEVELOP A NEW METHODOLOGY ONCE WE ARE FURTHER PASSED IN THE PANDEMIC AND ELIGIBILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES HAVE STABILIZED AS YOU CAN IMAGINE- THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF READING AND HAVING TO FOCUS ON THE REAL TIME CHALLENGES AND SO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE FURTHER. DOWN THE LINE BEFORE WE ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS- HOWEVER THE CALFRESH ADMINISTRATION REBATES WILL BE ABLE TO RIGHT SIZE THE CALPERS COUNTY PROPHECIES WHILE WE ALSO DEVELOP A MULTI YEAR PLAN TO BRING EFFICIENCIES AND TO THE PROGRAM. I'M NEXT ITEM THAT IS ON THE AGENDA IS IN REGARDS TO THE- PROPOSED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR FOOD BANK FUNDING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET. AND SO I'M CDSS IS CURRENTLY PROVIDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF FOOD BOXES PER MONTH. TO OUR FOOD BANKS UTILIZING OUR COOPER NINETEEN GOOD BANKS THE PORT FUNDING. AND THIS FUNDING WOULD CONTINUE TO ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE AT THIS LEVEL THROUGH JUNE OF THIS YEAR. THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF FIFTY MILLION IS AN AUGMENTATION TO THE CALVET PROGRAM- AND IS PROPOSED TO ALLOW THE EMERGENCY FOOD BOX PROGRAM TO AND- WHILE PROVIDING FOOD BANKS WITH THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO. TO MAKE FOR A SMOOTH THE RAMP DOWN EFFORT RATE AS FEDERAL AND STATE EMERGENCY FOOD ALLOCATIONS BEGAN TO- TO TAPER OFF. THE THIRD ITEM IS RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EXPANSION- ANY PARTICULAR ADDRESS SCENE- THE TARGETED POPULATION- IN TERMS OF OUR STATUS RELATED TO THE PLANNING- WE HAVE ALREADY KICKED OFF OR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS IN FACT IT BEGUN ABOUT OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. THERE ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED QUARTERLY MEETINGS WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND WE ARE FOCUSING RIGHT NOW ON IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND SORT OF. DEVELOPING OUR TIMELINES. AS WE GET CLOSER TO- SORT OF RAMPING UP WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE INCREASE OUR OUR OUR MEETINGS. TO A BI MONTHLY CADENCE- IN PARTICULAR AS WE GET CLOSER TO ANTICIPATED IMPLEMENTATION DATE RIGHT- IN TERMS OF THE AUTOMATION. CONVERSATION THAT IS A LARGE PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON GOING ON A MONTHLY BASIS BETWEEN. THE DEPARTMENT KELSALL AS- AND- CWPA- THOSE HAVE BEEN REGULAR WEEK TAKING PLACE. IN TERMS OF WHO IS GOING TO BE TARGETED BY THIS EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM. THE FIFTY FIVE YEAR AND OLDER- POPULATION IS WHO WE ARE PROPOSING- FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE ARE THERE TEND TO BE FEWER SUPPORTS FOR THIS POPULATION- AND IN LIFE ALTERNATIVES FOR OLDER ADULTS YOU KNOW THEY THEY DON'T HAVE. THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE SCHOOL BASED MEALS OR OR OTHER PROGRAMS RIGHT. AND SO THEY WOULD OTHERWISE- PERHAPS- GO WITHOUT IT'S AND SO THAT IS ONE. REASON ON THE OTHER THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IT DONE IN THE- HE NEEDS AND SUPPORTS FOR THIS OLDER- OUR POPULATION IT'S ALSO A KEY PRIORITY AND GOAL OF THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING FOR TRUSTEES HI THIS POPULATION AND THIS PARTICULAR NEED. AND LASTLY THE PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR IDENTIFICATION OF FILLING KEY GAPS IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SUCH AS- WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH THE MEDICAID EXPANSION- TO ALL PERSONS REGARDLESS OF OUR DOCUMENT KITS DOT. THE NEXT ITEM IS RELATED TO THE SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION FOR- TO LOOK OLDER ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. I THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY BEGUN THE PROCESS- INTERNALLY WE ARE ENGAGING WITH OUR PARTNERS WITHIN THE RESEARCH AUTOMATION AND DATA DIVISION. THEY HAVE A HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN UNIT THAT HELPS TO FACILITATE- THE PLANNING PROCESS AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND SO WE ARE ENGAGING WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING A PLAN. ON HOW WE WOULD ROLL OUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW APPLICATION. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN A SERIES OF INTERNAL MEETINGS AND WE PLAN ON CONTINUE TO CONTINUING TO COORDINATE AND DEVELOP A PROCESS. TO ENGAGE OUR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS AND SO WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE DEPARTMENT WILL BEGIN CONVENING- WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. TO OBTAIN THEIR INPUT INTO THE SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION PROCESS AND WE DO FEEL WE ARE ON TARGET TO- RELEASE I IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE NEXT ITEM IS RELATED TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A STATE WIDE TELEPHONE BASED SERVICE MODEL. AND SO- WE WERE REQUIRED TO- TO PRESENT TO YOU A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT RESULTED IN A PROCESS KICKED OFF BY- SECTION SEVENTY B. OF ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THIRTY FIVE. AND SO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION WITH CHINESE. FOOD ADVOCATES- THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE THAWS I WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE IN A PROCESS TO IDENTIFY RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO IMPLEMENT A FULLY TELEPHONE BASED SERVICE MODEL STATEWIDE. AND SO THE RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED CONTAINED. WITHIN THE SUMMARY THAT I WILL PROVIDE TO YOU TODAY REALLY ARE- PURSUANT TO THAT CONVERTS THE CONVERSATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS REFLECTED OF THOSE STAKEHOLDERS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCESS. IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THAT WE LEVERAGED WE DID OUR LEVERAGE SURVEYS TO COLLECT INPUT FROM OUR COUNTY CALFRESH. ELIGIBILITY REPRESENTATIVES ALONG WITH FOOD ADVOCATES N. OR A CA YOU LABOR PARTNERS- IN ADDITION WE WANTED TO RECOGNIZE AND CALL OUT THAT MANY COUNTIES ARE ALREADY DOING- MUCH OF THIS. AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THEIR CURRENT TELEPHONE BASED BUSINESS OPERATION PRACTICES AND PROCESSING. AND SO THAT WAS VERY USEFUL TO HELP INFORM THAT THE CONVERSATION WE ALSO GATHERED FEEDBACK FROM THE SIZE AND INCORPORATED THAT INTO THE SUGGESTIONS- AND THAT THE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE SURVEYS ARE WE DID ALSO COORDINATE AND WORK WITH OUR PART NURSE. THE SPONSOR THIS SECTION OF THE BILL AND HOSTED A LISTENING SESSION TO GATHER FEEDBACK FROM EXPERTS WITH EXPERIENCE IN TELEPHONE BASED SERVICE MODELS- AND THEN LASTLY THE LISTENING SESSION I DID INCLUDE. OUR COUNTY CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY REPRESENTATIVES- ALONG WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND OTHER FOOD ADVOCATES. AND SO GENERALLY SPEAKING IN THE RECORD DIDN'T RECOMMENDATIONS THAT- ARE IDENTIFIED AGAIN REFLECTING- THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS- INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ESTABLISH TELEPHONIC BUSINESS PROPERTIES ACROSS THE STATE. I'M THAT WOULD ENHANCE CALL CENTER FEATURES THAT WOULD EXPLORE ITS POTENTIAL OF INTERACTIVE VOICE RESPONSE OR OTHERWISE KNOWNAS IVR SYSTEMS. AND EXPLORE IMPROVEMENTS IN HOW THE COUNTY IS- ARE IDENTIFIED AS COLORS IN OUTBOUND CALLS AND SO THAT'S AN INTERESTING ONE IT'S WHERE. I COUNTY CALLS AN INDIVIDUAL AND PERHAPS IT SHOWS UP AS A BLOCK CALLED RIGHT- WE WOULD WANT TO EXPONENTIALLY EXPLORE WAYS TO IDENTIFY IT AS COUNTY TAX RATES SO THAT INDIVIDUALS. ARE MORE LIKELY TO PICK UP THE CALL. I'M THE NEXT I THAT- I'D LIKE TO RAISE UP IN THE STAR OF AB SEVENTY NINE. THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT- THAT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE STAR OF WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATIONS. AND SO WITH THE AB SEVENTY NINE P. POPULATE IT'S OUR WORK GROUP BEGAN MEETING LAST YEAR IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND HAVE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY ON A MONTHLY BASIS- THE WORKGROUP HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DROPPED TO BETTER PEOPLE RELATED STAR SEVEN AND START SEVEN EIGHT FORMS. AND IS THOSE FORMS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER FINAL REVIEW I'M AND WE DO EXPECT TO FINALIZE THOSE WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. AND THEN ONCE WE'VE- FINALIZE THAT REVIEW- WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND INCLUDE THE WORKGROUP- IN CONSULTING WITH THE VENDOR TO HELP US INFORM HIM AND THEN- CENTER DESIGN ASPECTS AND USER TESTING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT REAL. LIVED EXPERIENCE IN INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE- ACTUALLY A PART OF OUR PROGRAM- HELP OFFER FEEDBACK RIGHT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE EFFORT. AND THEN- THE DEPARTMENT IS ON TRACK TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE A LETTER BY APRIL OF THIS YEAR TO INFORM COUNTY IS THAT AND THE CONSORTIA. ABOUT THE FORTHCOMING IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR PRE POPULATED STAR SEVEN AND- FROM THEN WE WOULD BE IN THE DESIGN AND USER. TESTING PHASE WHICH WE WOULD EXPECT TO THE BEGIN BETWEEN MARCH AND JUNE OF THIS YEAR. AND SO ALL OF THIS WOULD CULMINATE IN A LETTER SORT OF A HIGHLIGHTING THESE TIME LINES- AND THAT WOULD BE SCHEDULED FOR RELEASE IN NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR. WITH THE TARGETED- IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF THE ACTUAL FORMS IN THE SYSTEM BY JANUARY. OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. NO WE DID NOT. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR TYLER WOODS WITH THE TO OF FINANCE. I WAS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN BRIAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST A BRIEF MOMENT KNOWN AS- WAS REFERENCED BY THE QUESTIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION JUST ADDRESS ON C. FIVE IT EXPANSION- WE DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN IMPORTANT DECISION LAID OUT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- EXPRESSED A- DESIRE TO EVENTUALLY EXPAND THIS ASSISTANCE WHICH RIGHT NOW SERVES A VERY NARROW- POPULATION OF IMMIGRANTS. BASICALLY A LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY OF US IN FIVE YEARS. THIS IS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO EVENTUALLY EXPAND THOSE FOOD BENEFITS THE TOTAL POPULATION THAT IS CURRENTLY IN ELIGIBLE FOR. FOOD ASSISTANCE DO ENTIRELY TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS IS SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WITH SEVEN- FOLKS USING AN AGE BASED APPROACH BUT DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH AGE RANGES WOULD BENEFIT FIRST NOT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED WE START WITH AGES FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER AND THEY'VE GIVEN YOU SOME ARGUMENTS FOR WHY. BUT THERE ARE OTHER POPULATIONS ARE NEEDING- WE THINK LOOKING AT THE DATA OUT THERE ARE OTHER POPULATIONS THAT ARE BOTH LARGER AMONGST THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA AND MORE LIKELY TO BE. INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM AND THESE ARE JUST FACTORS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND IN DECIDING HOW EXACTLY THIS THIS ROLLOUTS WOULD BE TARGETED THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. GREAT THANK YOU AGAIN MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KATHY SANDERLING FEET OF PTA THE QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS- TALK ABOUT COUNTIES EXPERIENCE WITH CALFRESH AND WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON DURING THE PANDEMIC WHAT WE NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT THE WORK AND SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT MUST HERNANDEZ TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AS THE REPORT. SO FIRST OFF WHAT WE'VE SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC IS- INCREASES AND CAN EXPLODE AND APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN LARGELY SUSTAINED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PANDEMIC PERIOD. CALFRESH IS. USUALLY A LEADING INDICATOR OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. BOB GRAHAM THAT HISTORICALLY HAS GROWN FIRST DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR RECESSION WITH THE PANDEMIC HOWEVER WE THOUGHT- IN ADDITION TO THAT INITIAL INCREASE THE SAME KINDS OF BUMPS THAT I HAD TALKED ABOUT IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM PANEL. HOWEVER THE NUMBERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT EVERY POINT OF THE PANDEMIC THAN THE RAWNUMBERS THAT WE TALK ABOUT HOW. WE WENT FROM AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS FOR A WEEK BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. BUT DURING THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE REACHED AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICATIONS PER WEEK FOR A SHORT PERIOD SO THAT HAS BALLOT PAPER OFF THE BAT IT STILL REMAINS HIGH AND ABOVE THE FORTY THOUSAND NUMBER MORE LIKE. SIXTY THOUSAND. I WILL HONESTLY THAT MANY COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING AND THAT THE BUYER BUT THE SUSTAIN INCREASES HAVE REALLY EXACERBATED A SITUATION THAT WE'VE BEEN FACING FOR YEARS NOW IN WHICH COUNTIES ARE SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED FOR THE WORK THAT WE DO COULD MINISTER CAL CALFRESH ON BEHALF OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'VE NOT RECEIVED A COST OF DOING BUSINESS INCREASE FOR CALFRESH SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SO THIS MEANS WERE BEING FUNDED AS A WORKER SALARIES BENEFIT COSTS THE COST OF OFFICE SPACE IN OFFICE SUPPLIES EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO GO INTO OPERATING THAT OFFICE AND STAFFING AT- IT'S STILL THE SAME COST AS OF ONE TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. THAT IF THE STATE HAD PER. IN THE WILL AND PLAY AND JOB TO ITS SHARE OF CALFRESH ADMINISTRATION COSTS DURING THIS TIME. STATE GENERAL FUND THE COUNTIES WOULD BE HIGHER BY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE STATUTORY FEDERAL AND COUNTY MATCHING FUNDS THE TOTAL AMOUNT WHEN YOU TAKE THOSE INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. HIGHER AT THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD BE FUNDED THAN IT IS TODAY. THAT THE QUAKE TO ABOUT SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED WORKERS MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND WORKERS THAT WE WOULD HAVE ON THE JOB ON THOSE FRONT LINES. THAT WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO HIGHER BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THE SPOT. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN WE'RE UNDER FIVE. THE TWO MAIN THINGS YOU THINK ABOUT WITH CALFRESH OUR TIMELINESS AND ACCURACY YOU WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE HUNGRY TO GET THEIR BENEFITS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE YEAH WHEN SOMEONE IS ELIGIBLE YOU WANT TO FIND THEM ELIGIBLE IF THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE WE SHOULD FIND THEM NOT ELIGIBLE YEAH WE ALSO NEED TO CALCULATE THE APPROPRIATE BENEFIT AMOUNT. FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY. IN ADDITION SHIHO- THE CALCULATION COUNTIES HAVE GENERALLY THIRTY DAYS TO PROFIT A CALFRESH APPLICATION BUT SOMEONE WHO COMES IN AND HAS A CERTAIN. OF REQUIREMENTS THAT SUCH AS A VERY LOW AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE BANK HAVE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE NEED REQUIREMENT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PROCESS THOSE WITHIN THREE DAYS. AND COUNTY STRUGGLED WITH THAT'S QUITE FRANKLY AND IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING AND THE LACK OF STAFFING. ACCURACY IS REALLY CRITICAL AS WELL- THERE ARE FEDERAL REVIEWS OF OUR ACCURACY BOTH THAT ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION AT TRIAL AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT AMOUNT AND GETTING THAT WRONG IN EITHER DIRECTION A LOWER OR HIGHER BENEFIT. THAT SOMEONE IS A LEGIBLE FOR FINDING SOMEONE INELIGIBLE WHEN THEY'RE REALLY ELIGIBLE OR VICE VERSA CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT IN PENALTIES FOR THE STATE. THE COUNTIES ALSO SHARING THESE PENALTIES IF I COUNTY CONTRIBUTED TO THAT OVERALL. THE ISSUE THAT RESULTED IN THE PENALTY. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS AND- THAT IT COULD. TO THE R. FUNDING WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS RECEIVE FULL FUNDING FOR K. FOR INCREASED. THE AFTER FIVE I HAVE. OUT OF THE MEDICATION THAT BROUGHT IN YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SS I RECIPIENTS I WE WERE NOT FULLY FUNDED FOR THAT USE THAT INCREASE EVEN AT THAT TWO THOUSAND AND ONE LEVEL. AND THERE HAS BEEN RECENT LEGISLATION PASSED IN PARTICULAR A BILL THAT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO HAVE A PERSON IDENTIFIED TO WORK WITH THE COLLEGE SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT BENEFITS ARE MADE AVAILABLE WHICH WE TOTALLY AGREE THERE'S A FUNDING FOR THAT THE BUDGET WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT ISSUE AND HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED AND NAY. BUT TYPICALLY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION GAP WE ARE REQUESTING SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AS A BRIDGE TO THE NEW BUDGETING METHODOLOGY THAT MUST HERNANDEZ MATCH AND- WE'RE EXPECTING THAT METHODOLOGY TO BE USED IN TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IF WE STAY ON TRACK SO WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU'D BE DISCUSSING NEXT YEAR WITH ALL OF US DURING THAT I JUST YES SORT OF DISCUSSION OVER BUDGET CLASS ONE. SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND CAN BE SEEN AS A BRANCH THAT HOPEFULLY WILL ONLY LAST ONE YEAR TO US GETTING TO THAT METHODOLOGY. I WILL SAY THAT THAT- INTENDED DID ASK WHAT THEY'RE THINKING YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT ADDITIONAL DELAY AND THE METHODOLOGY. IT MADE SENSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC NOTHING IS A STEADY STATE RIGHT NOW AND SO DELAYING IT A COUPLE OF YEARS MAKES SENSE BUT WE ARE IT WORK HURTING COUNTIES ARE REALLY HURTING IN THIS PROGRAM AND- SO WE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT. OF THAT AT THE BRANCH. COUPLE MORE COMMON HERE- ARE MOVING NEEDLE AS FAR TAKE. AND RETAINING OF THE- WE THINK THAT WERE. MANY I THINK MOST. FOR CDS AFTER SHOPPING EXPLAINING THAT CHANGES TWENTY TWENTY ONE TRAILER BILL THAT INCORPORATED MOST ASPECTS OF THE BILL BY CHAIR TANK. THAT WE SPONSORED AT CEDAR BDA IT REALLY PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS NOT JUST YOU. I'M GETTING PEOPLE ON TO THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE RETAIN. OF THE PRE POPULATED FORM IN THIS HERNANDEZ MENTIONS REALLY EXCITING. I THINK- AS I ALLUDED TO IN THE POWER SECTOR MONEY- IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO GO FURTHER. THANK ELIPORT IN POLICY LAB RECENTLY DID SOME ANALYSIS OF CALFRESH DATA. AND THEY FOUND NOT A SURPRISE PEOPLE TEND TO DROP OFF AT RENEWAL OR WHEN THEY'RE FILLING IN THAT SEMI ANNUAL REPORT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR. BASICALLY WHEN THERE'S A PAPERWORK REQUIREMENT SOMEONE HAVE TO MAKE THAT REPORT. IT CAN RESULT IN A DROP BOX OF ELIGIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO. OTHERWISE ARE ELIGIBLE BUT THEY JUST DIDN'T GET THE FORM ACT. AND SO THE BEST WAY TO STOP THIS IS JACK MINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE THE REPORTING IN. THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT- AS I KIND OF AGAIN ALLUDED TO IN THE PRIOR PANEL WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL ADVOCACY TO BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THAT FOR CALFRESH- IT MAY BE WORTH PURSUING WE THINK WE'RE NOT THE ONLY STATE. THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT I COULD MAKE A CASE THAT WOULD BENEFIT. HUNGRY PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM- OBVIOUSLY THOUGH WE. COULD WE CAN'T JUST DOTHAT ON OUR OWN. AND THEN FINALLY REGARD TO THE CLASS RELATED TO THE STATE HEALTH. REPORT WE APPRECIATE THAT THE STATE THE FINAL REPORT REALLY TARGETED IN ON A FEW KEY RECOMMENDATIONS. WILL BE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE. HOW AND WHEN AND THE IDEAS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND WE THINK SOME OF THE IDEAS KIND OF PIGGYBACK ON EXISTING WORK IN AFRICA. SO THEY MIGHT BE EASIER TO GET. AS I WRAP UP I DO JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO COMMENT ON THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION REPORT. THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA. WE'VE PROVIDED SOME INPUT TO THE COMMISSION LATE LAST YEAR ON A DRAFT OF THE REPORT. AND HAD SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT WE SHARE WITH THE COMMISSION AT THAT TIME WE HAD A ANTICIPATED THING REVISED VERSION OF THE REPORT. PRIOR TO ITS RELEASE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY APPEARS REPORTED BEEN PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND HAVE NOT TAKEN PWBA CONCERNS INTO ACCOUNT. WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO GETTING MORE BENEFITS TO COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN OF PROGRAM CHANGES THAT WILL ENABLE THAT'S- BUT A NUMBER OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE COMMISSION REPORTER QUITE FRANKLY UNWORKABLE. GIVEN THE TIME THAT WERE UNDER HERE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND WRITING. TO FURTHER DETAIL THE ISSUES WE HAVE WITH THAT THE FACT REPORT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND OF COURSE THE BILL THE ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SHANTI PRASAD SENIOR POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. THANK YOU CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE- CITY. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT FOOD SECURITY AND THE CURRENT IMPACT ON HUNGER AND FUTURE IMPACTS ABOUT THE LOOMING WITH THE LOOMING FOOD CLIFF WHEN THE FEDERAL PUBLIC EMERGENCY OPERATION COMES TO AN END. THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY CURRENTLY EXPIRES ON APRIL SIXTEENTH BUT COULD BE EXTENDED IT PROVIDES SEVERAL TEMPORARY HELP US IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE HELPED TO MITIGATE HUNGER CONFERENCE IS CURRENTLY BEING EXPANDED TO MORE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THERE'S A SUSPENSION OF THE AVON TIME LIMIT. WHEN WE LOSE THE PHEV THE STATE COULD LOSE THESE PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES WHICH WOULD BE A MAJOR AND- ON HUNGER AT THE SAME TIME ADMINISTRATORS COULD LOSE FLEXIBILITY AS THEY'RE USING CREATING INCREASED WORKLOAD FOR COUNTIES. BUT PERHAPS THE MOST DAMAGING LOSS WILL BE THE END OF THE EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS FOR CALFRESH WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH IN FOOD PURCHASING POWER. DESPITE THESE ANOTHER PANDEMIC RELATED SUPPORTS FOOD INSECURITY RATES IN CALIFORNIA REMAIN VERY HIGH RATES DECREASED SOMEWHAT OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT AS OF OCTOBER ELEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS HOUSEHOLD PULSE SURVEY THE FOOD INSECURITY RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS EIGHTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT. THE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN IS TWENTY FOUR POINT 9% THE RACIAL DISPARITIES ARE WORSE THE LATIN NEXT POPULATION HAS TWENTY SIX POINT 1% FOOD INSECURITY. AND LATIN X. HOUSEHOLDS THE CHILDREN ARE AT THIRD B. FOUR POINT 7% AND THERE ARE SIMILARLY HIGH RATES OF HUNGER FOR ALL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THESE ARE SHOCKING TREATS AND FOOD BANKS ARE REPORTING THAT DEMAND HAS SPIKED IN TWO THOUSAND- IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO DUE TO THE HIGHEST INFLATION RATES IN FORTY YEARS AND THE- MAKRAN VARIANT AND THAT THEY CONTINUE TO SEE CLIENTS. WHO ARE ACCESSING A FOOD BANK FOR THE FIRST TIME THE LONG TERM REPERCUSSIONS OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC AND ENSUING ECONOMIC CRISIS. CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED WE'RE GRATEFUL TO CDSS FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK TO ENSURE COVERAGE ACCESS AND IT'S A BIG INCREASE IN CASELOAD. AND FOR IMPLEMENTING THE NEW PANDEMIC AB T. PROGRAM AND WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THAT AS MANY KIDS AS POSSIBLE RECEIVE THIS ASSISTANCE. AND THANKS TO THAT COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENTS FOR PROVIDING CRITICAL ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES WE SUPPORT THE REQUEST FOR ADEQUATE COUNTY FUNDING TO ADMINISTER CALFRESH ESPECIALLY AS DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO RISE. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO SEE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR DEVELOPING THE SIMPLIFIED CALFRESH APPLICATION FOR OLDER ADULTS AND HERE ADDITIONAL REQUESTS AND ITEMS WE SUPPORT. AS WE TRANSITION AWAY FROM COVERT RELATED EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND PROGRAMS WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE WE DO SO WITH THE PHASE OUT APPROACH. THAT PREVENTS SHOCKS TO PEOPLE'S BUDGETS AND THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS PEOPLE ARE STILL RELYING ON THEM TO PREVENT HUNGER. ESPECIALLY THE CALFRESH EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS AS AN EXAMPLE A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL ON SSI WHO IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS WILL RECEIVE ONLY TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH AFTER THE EA'S AND- LET'S LEARN FROM THE GREAT RECESSION'S RECOVERY IT TOOK TEN YEARS JUST TO REDUCE HUNGER TO PRE RECESSION LEVELS. OF 10% WHICH IS STILL UNACCEPTABLE AT FOUR MILLION FOOD INSECURE CALIFORNIANS FOOD BANKS TO CONTINUE TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PANDEMIC ARE ANTICIPATING AT LEAST TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC. AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO SEE THE GOVERNOR'S ADDITION A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET FOR COFFEE TO PURCHASE CALIFORNIA GROUND FOOD. AND WE REQUEST AN INCREASE TO THE ONGOING AMOUNT FROM EIGHT MILLION TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL BECAUSE FOODBANK DEMAND DOUBLED IT DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND THE STATE IS PROVIDING AT LEAST A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR EMERGENCY FOOD BOXES THE LAST TWO YEARS WHICH ENDS IN JUNE. SO THE BASE PRE PANDEMIC NEED WAS REALLY SIXTY MILLION AND WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY MILLION ONE TIME. TO MITIGATE THE PANDEMIC RECOVERY FOR A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION FOR HEALTHY. WE LEARN FROM OUR NETWORK SURVEY IN DECEMBER THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLIMATE RESILIENT EQUIPMENT NEEDS FOR FOOD BANKS AND THEIR FIVE THOUSAND PLUS AGENCY NETWORK HAVE INCREASED. BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS INCREASE IN FOOD THEY ARE DISTRIBUTING AND IT EXCEEDS SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE REQUESTING ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT A QUARTER OF THIS NEED. TO STORE AND TRANSPORT FOOD MORE EFFICIENTLY AND SUPPORT CLIMATE RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE. ANDWE REQUEST IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCESSING THE STATE DISASTER FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. CAFB ALSO SUPPORTS SEE FAST FOOD FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. INCREASING THE SNB AND TNB PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE PARITY WITH THE RECENT CALFRESH INCREASE. AND CAFB SUPPORTS CACHET PROGRAMS LIKE CAL WORKS TAX CREDITS GUARANTEED INCOME AND SSI SAID THAT CALIFORNIANS CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE POVERTY. PERMANENTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH HEAR FROM FED SOBRE EL ESTUDIO SENIOR ADVOCATE FROM NOURISH CALIFORNIA. EVERY GIRL GOT TENURE MYSELF BUT AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BY THE TIME TO SPEAK TODAY- MY NAME IS THAT THE VIOLENCE WILL BE YOU'LL AND I'M A SENIOR ADVOCATE WITH MARRIAGE CALIFORNIA- I JUST WANT TO START BY THINKING CHAIRPERSON ARAMBULA AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THEIR SUPPORT. AND SECURING FUNDING LAST YEAR TO BEGIN THE IMPLEMENTATION APPROVED FOR ALL BY INSURING SEPTEMBER SECOND READING AT THE CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ALSO KNOWN AS THE- THIS FINDING IS LAYING THE IMPACT. PARKS BY AND BENEFITS AND MANY CAL EVER. WHO ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM CAL YOU DID IT. STATUS WE ARE ALSO PLEASED WITH THE I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE OF THAT BEEN FOR. FIFTY FIVE AND OVER. FIFTY FIVE IS AN AND STEP TOWARDS AND- EVERY CAL. ACCESS IN ADDITION THE- REGARDLESS OF THAT IMMIGRATION STATUS. WELL PROPOSED. ALL OF THIS INITIAL FUNDING BY EXPANDING BENEFITS THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS OF ALL AGES. IT WILL ENSURE AN EQUITABLE STATE INTERESTS AND I THINK THIS SYSTEM THAT HELPS MITIGATE HUNGER AND POVERTY THAT HAVE BEEN BOTH EXACERBATED BY THE PEN THAT MAKE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IMMIGRANTS WERE ALREADY EXPERIENCING HIGH LEVELS OF FOOD INSECURITY AS A RESULT OF LOW WAGES. INCREASING HOUSING COSTS AND DESTRUCTIVE PICKING UP PROGRAMS ANTI IMMIGRANT POLICIES AND RHETORIC YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S WORTH PUTTING IN THE THIRD YEAR- CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO FACE THE PARCHMENT. AND HIGH LEVELS OF FOOD INSECURITY AND MAKING COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HIT ESPECIALLY HARD. HIGH INFECTION RATE STOP LOSSES AND LIMITED ACCESS TO PANDEMIC WRITTEN AFTERWARDS. IN ADDITION AND AGAINST EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF FOOD INSECURITY AS A RESULT OF THE FACIAL AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES AND BEING A PUBLIC NUISANCE WITHIN OUR STATE SAFETY NET PROGRAM. IMMIGRANTS ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY AND CHILDREN IN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE RITA FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO STRUGGLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. THE WILD HOW FAST AND THE CALIFORNIA FOR THE SYSTEM PROGRAM PROVIDES A CRITICAL LIFELINE FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW INCOME. PROGRAM EXCLUDE MANY AND AGAIN ON THE BASIS OF THE IMMIGRATION STATUS. THIS INCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. ARE DACA RECIPIENTS. TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS AND MIGRANTS NON AT EBS IMMIGRATION. AND SOME VISA HOLDERS. AND THIS IS THE FOR HER MEAN FOR IF I. SOMEONE THAT I'VE GOT CONSOLE THE YEARS AND WHAT TESTIFIED IN THE POP UP BOOK FOR ALL. THIRTY MINUTES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SHE'S A MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND MEGHAN INTEGRATION COLLABORATIVE. ALLEN HAD TO YOU AT THAT THE DAUGHTERS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH. IF YOU'RE A HUSBAND I'M NOT ELIGIBLE. I HARDLY KNOW HER FOR HAVE. WITH BACK. THROUGH BEFORE AND DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT HER SITUATION HAS WORKED AS A FAMILY REPUBLICAN CALLED IT. AND REDUCE INCOME. DUE TO JOB LOSS- WHY I'M HERE BECAUSE WE NEED A PERMANENT EQUITABLE SOLUTION THAT ADDRESSES THE LONGSTANDING ISSUE UP WOULDN'T THE CURING OF MY COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO LOOK FOR ALL. AND INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO ALL IMMIGRANTS HELP ALL COMMUNITY SIDE IMPROVED OUR ECONOMY AND HELP THE WEATHER CRISIS AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURN BUT BY ONE WORD WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING. SO WE STRONGLY URGE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO GO FURTHER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ALLOCATED AN OLD BUDGET. BY EXPANDING THE THOUGHT BENEFITS CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES REGARDLESS OF WHAT IMMIGRATION STATUS NO EXCEPTIONS MIKE GLEASON. THANK LOADING- THIS IS THE TIME FOR OUR STATE THAT CHAMPION EQUITABLE POLICIES ANDPUT FORTH A DIFFERENT VISION FOR OUR NATION ONE WHERE ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS THE FOOD THEY NEED. THANK. YOU KAREN COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL GO TO J. BURKE. DIRECTOR GOVERNMENT AND- RELATIONS FOR THE- STUDENT A- COMMISSION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ARAMBULA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE SUBCOMMITTEE TODAY WE KNOW FROM NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT PUTIN SECURITY IS A WIDESPREAD AND GROWING CHALLENGE OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES YOUR STUDENT SERVICE THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION HAS FOUND THAT ONE OUT OF THREE STUDENTS REPORT BEING SECURE AND IT'S DOING SURVEYS THAT WE CONDUCTED FROM THE ONSET OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE CHALLENGES. I'VE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED. RELATIVELY FEW ELIGIBLE COLLEGE STUDENTS RECEIVE CALFRESH BENEFITS FOR WHICH THEY QUALIFY. WHAT DATA IS LIMITED IN THIS AREA AND I'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN A MOMENT WHEN CDS AS ISSUED A REPORT ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE CALFRESH. THEY FOUND THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE LIKELY AND ROLLED. HOWEVER THAT'S OUT OF AS MANY AS FOUR HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ELIGIBLE. MR NEED COMMISSION CAN BE NO WORKER IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY. THAT INCLUDED STUDENTS CAMPUS BASIC NEEDS LEADERS RESEARCH EXPERTS AND STAFF FROM COUNTY AND STATE. AGENCIES TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY DO ARE NOT BACK. THE BENEFIT AND I. ME THROUGH WHICH WE BETTER THEM CALPERS SUPPORT. OKAY A BRIEF WE SHARE A FEW OF HIGH LEVEL TAKEAWAY AND WRECKED. THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN OUR THAT THE FACT YOU MAKE NOT RELEASED THE REPORT AND LOOK FOR TO JERRY AN ADVANCE CALL OF THAT. ART INCLUDING PARTNERS AT COUNTY STATE EIGHT- AND THE RECOMMENDED. HERE TO WORK- SIGNIFICANT REVISION THAT WE MADE AND- IN LIGHT OF. THEIR FEEDBACK IN RESPONSE AS WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THEM SINCE THE CONCLUSION OF THE WORKER PROCESS ITSELF. SO FIRST I'M TO START WITH SOME OF THE TAKEAWAYS AND WHY ARE SO FEW COLLEGE STUDENTS- COURT ELIGIBLE ACTUALLY RECEIVING CALFRESH. WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE FIRST THAT FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY STRUCTURED TO KEEP STUDENTS OUT OF THE SNAP PROGRAM. STUDENTS MUST QUALIFY FOR AN EXEMPTION IN ORDER TO APPLY. FOR YOURS THIS IS PUT AN EXTRA BURDEN OF PROOF ON STUDENTS TO NOT ONLY. APPLY AND MEET FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT ANY OTHER APPLICANT WOULD. BUT TO ALSO DEMONSTRATE AND ENSURE THAT THE COUNTY RECOGNIZES THEIR EXEMPTION FROM THE STUDENT WILL EACH TIME THERE'S A CHANGE IN POLICY ON HOW THOSE TWO APPLICATIONS CAN BE PROCESSED WATER RESULTING FROM FEDERAL OR STATE GUIDANCE. THIS MUST BE COMMUNICATED ACROSS. ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHICH CAMERAS IN INCOME AND PUT. OF SUCH. LIKE ALLOWING STUDENTS STOP THIRD THEIR. OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR AND THE TIMING OF STUDENTS MOVING INTO NEW COUNTIES ALSO CREATES A LARGE AND RECURRING SEASONAL SURGES APPLICATIONS. AT ALL ACADEMIC TERM BEGINS MANY COUNTIES WITH LARGE STUDENT POPULATIONS YOUR WAY OF APPLICATIONS THAT THAT AT THE SAME TIME. THIS CREATES REAL WORKLOAD ISSUES FOR STAFF THAT RESULT IN LONGER PROCESSING TIMES FOR STUDENT APPLICANTS. SO NOW THAT I'VE LAID OUT A FEW OF THE ISSUES THAT HINDER STEVEN ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. TO HELP BETTER SERVE STUDENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN PILOT NEW APPROACHES THAT WOULD HELP SUPPORT STUDENT ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM- ONE OF WHICH BEING- ESTABLISHING REGIONAL HUBS THE COUNTIES AS IS CURRENTLY UTILIZED IN THE CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR IMMIGRANTS. IT WOULD HAVE A SPECIALLY TRAINED TEAM OF COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS OKAY FONG PROCESSING STUDENT APPLICATIONS FROM WITHIN THEIR CONSORTIUM. AS CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS EXPANDING ACCESS PROGRAM FOR IMMIGRANT AND UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES. WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST CONSIDERING THE USE ON A PILOT BASIS OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION JUST URBAN DOCUMENTED STUDENTS THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDING THEIR INFORMATION TO THE STATE FOR FINANCIALLY PURPOSES. THIS CULD ULTIMATELY SERVE AS A PILOT FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONSIDER MAKING THIS IN PRACTICE- AVAILABLE WITH THE USE OF THE FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID. THE PASS UP. SO THAT THEY ARE ALSO CONSIDERED FOR SNAP BENEFITS WITHOUT SUBMITTING AN ADDITIONAL APPLICATION. WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BETTER LEVERAGE DATA AND A FEW KEY WAYS. FIRST WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA MUST START TO TRACK ACTUAL AND NOT ESTIMATED STUDENT APPLICATIONS AND ACCEPTANCE INTO THE PROGRAM. WE CAN ALSO LOOK TO SEE HOW WE CAN AT A MINIMUM PRE POPULATE THE CALPERS SHOP LOCATION WITH FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION DATA. TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REDUNDANT QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING STUDENTS. AS WELL AS UTILIZED FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEAL DATA FROM OUR K. TWELVE PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS LIKELY ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH AT THE MATRICULATION TO HIGHER EDUCATION. AND OF COURSE WE MUST ALSO SUPPORTER COUNTIES IN THE WORK OF PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. CALIFORNIA SHOULD USE THE FUNDING FORMULA TO APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZE COUNTIES EXISTING WORKLOADS AND CREATE INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO GENERATE AND PROCESS ADDITIONAL CASES. WE MUST ALSO EXPAND COMMUNICATIONS EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTING. NEW ACCESS POLICIES FOR STUDENTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR IT DETECTS. FINALLY A BENEFITS ARE ONLY HELPFUL TO STUDENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY UTILIZE THEM. WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CAN UTILIZE THEIR CALPERS BENEFITS ON CAMPUS BY DIRECTING COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO ACCEPT EBT CARDS CAMPUS BEAUTY DINING FACILITIES. GROWING NUMBER CAMPUS THAT IS ALREADY DONE THIS AND R. OR TAKING STEPS TO DO SO BUT THERE'S MORE WORK THAT CAN BE DONE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS FOR TODAY AND WE OF COURSE I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE OUR PARTNERS WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION. AT LOCAL AGENCIES. TO MOVE FORWARD IN BETTER SERVING OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'M INTERESTING INTERESTED IN THE YOU KNOW THERE IS DEFINITELY A SHORTFALL IN OUR FOOD BANK- ALLOCATION THIS YEAR AND I'M WONDERING WHAT WE CAN DO OR WHAT ARE WE DOING TO. MAKE SURE THAT THAT GAP IS FILLED- I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FOOD AND SECURITY WILL THINK THAT THAT JUST YOU KNOW FAMILIES GO TO FOOD BANKS AND THAT ARE ARE DESPERATE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE. ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE VISITING THE FOOD BANKS AS WELL AND THEIR FULL FOOD AD SECURE WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE PROVIDING. FOOD FOR THEIR STUDENTS- SOLD SO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR THE GAP FUNDING DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH AS TO HOW MUCH THAT IS AND WHAT. ARE YOU DOING OR WHAT ARE WE DOING I WOULD WE NEED TO DO TO BE ABLE TO FIVE FILL THAT GAP I KNOW ADDING MORE MONEY WOULD BE GREAT BY TODD HAVE THERE BEEN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TO- BRIDGING THAT GAP. IT IS A QUESTION. IT ARE YOU ASKING ME WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO OTHER THAN FUNDS. YES YES THANK YOU AT. WELL THERE CERTAINLY WHERE WE ARE CERTAINLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- AND ALL OF THE RELEVANT TAB- BUDGET LEADERS RESPONSES AS TO YOU KNOW ARE THEY OPEN TO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING- YEAH THERE'S CERTAINLY- THERE IS ROOM IN THERE CERTAINLY. AMENABLE TO- MORE FUNDING I MEAN OF COURSE I DON'T I DON'T HAVE MINIMAL I WANT TO SAY YES. THAT THEY'RE GOING. THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT OF COURSE- BUT- THAT IS THAT IS NOT THAT USUALLY NOT HOW NOT THROUGH THE RESPONSES THAT WE GET RIGHT AROUND AND THIS TIME IN FEBRUARY BUT- WE DEFINITELY WANNA AND WANNA YES ANSWERS WHILE I'M THERE THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO FUNDING FOOD- SO- YEAH I HOPE I HOPE I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION YES YES AND- DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE AS TO HOW MUCH THE SHORTFALL IS OR THE- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU NEED TO CLOSE THAT GAP. YEAH SO WHAT I WAS AS I SAID THERE SO RIGHT NOW WE GET EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING IN CALHOUN- AND- THERE IS. WE ARE ASKING TO INCREASE THAT TO SIXTY MILLION ON GOINGS ON INCREASE OF FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT A ONE TIME ASK. THE GOVERNOR'S ALREADY SUGGEST THAT PROPOSED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. ONE TIME ASK IN JANUARY AND WE'RE ASKING TO INCREASE THAT BY TEN MILLION. SO WITH ALL THE MATH DONE THAT WOULD BE A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION FOR CALIPHATE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- AND- OF COURSE THERE IS THAT BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THT'S GONNA SOLVE HUNGER AND- TO AND TO THE- TO MEET THE GAP OF THE EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS ENDING WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THEY'LL AND IT COULD END IS. AS EARLY AS THE MID APRIL BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN RIGHT NOW WHEN THE- FEDERAL A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS. BUT WERE WE- THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE- SORT OF A MITIGATION- THERE TO- KIND OF. HM THAT'S IT THAT'S IT IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE GAP- WHEN THOSE EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS AND WE THINK THAT. THAT THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER A PHASE OUT APPROACH THAT PREVENTS YOU KNOW THAT THAT SHOCKING LOSS- JUST TO SAFETY NET PROGRAMS- BUT- YOU KNOW. AGAIN WITH IT WE NEED. A VARIETY OF INPUTS FROM CALFRESH- TO- IN FOOD BANKS AND- JUST EIGHTY INCREASES ALL AROUND AND ALL OF THE CASH AID PROGRAMS FROM TAX CREDITS- TO- CAL WORKS. RIGHT WELL JUST TO PUT IT INTO CONTEXT- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING NUMBERS AND DOLLARS AND CENTS HEREBY. WHAT DO YOU KNOW I WANT TO BRING IT MORE TO THE HUMAN VALUE OF THIS WHAT HAPPENS ON APRIL. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE NUMBER- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR SERVICES LOOK LIKE AFTER A BILL IF WE DON'T- STEP UP AND GIVE YOU. YOU KNOW THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON. YOU KNOW THE. THE OF COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WITH THE IN IS FOR HIM MILLION DOLLARS MONTH. IN FOOD. OKAY I'M NUMBER OF P. NUMBER FAMILY THAT YOUR SERVICE. THERE IS SIR OKAY YOUNG THERE- I CAN GET THAT NUMBER TO YOU IT'S ACTUALLY AND I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE REPORTS IN THE SENATE BUDGET- REPORT I CAN PULL THAT UP. AND ANSWER THAT FOR YOU IN A IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS OR I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THE- I THINK WHAT MIGHT MY THE OBJECTIVE TO THE QUESTION IS TO BRING THE HUMAN VALUE TO THIS AND- YOU KNOW OUR- TO APPEAL TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A NUMBER ON THE ON THE- YOU KNOW THE- IT'S NOT JUST A LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET- THESE ARE ACTUAL FOLKS THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED NOT JUST FAMILIES BUT- YOU KNOW WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WE WANT TO SUPPORT. EVERYONE IN THE FOOD AND SECURITY EXCEPT WHEN I WORKED. IN THIS COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS AND SENSE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING BUT I THINK THE HUMAN VALUE IS ONE OF THEM CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IF THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO END IN APRIL SO THAT'S WHERE I'M THAT'S MY PURPOSE OF THE- FOR THE QUESTIONS. YEAH APPRECIATE THAT AND IT MEAN IT IS IT IS A SIGNIFICANT- NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS- AND- IF YOU WAIT TOO. LONG AFTER MOMENT CANCELING NINE. THAT NUMBER FOR YOU BUT IT IT WHEN IT WAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND IN A REPORT IT- IT WAS. IT WAS NOTED HOW APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH FOR HOW MANY FAMILIES- INVOLVES AND OR JUST TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WHILE YOU DO THAT- YOU KNOW ALL OF US HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN OUR DISTRICTS ARE DOING FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS- I MEAN THANKSGIVING WAS. IT FROM MY DISTRICT WAS THE BIGGEST EVER HE TO PUT IT INTO CONTEXT I USUALLY WOULD DO ABOUT- FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED- TURKEYS AND FOOD BASKETS FOR FOLKS THIS LAST YEAR WE DID THREE THOUSAND. AND SOLD BACK THAT INCREASE IN IN MY AREA JUST FOR THE HOLIDAYS WAS SO SIGNIFICANT THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE THANKFULLY WE WEREN'T- WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TURN ANYBODY AWAY BUT I WANT TO. SHOW THE IMPACT- TO THESE PROGRAMS ENDING IN IN APRIL AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE TURNED AWAY IF YOU TURN PEOPLE AWAY- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE- LIKE I SAID IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TALK BUT BUDGET IN DOLLARS AND CENTS BUT- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED. I AGREE WITH YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOU POINTING THAT OUT THAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT. ABOUT PEOPLE INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF NUMBERS THAT IS- REALLY IMPORTANT- AND- WE CAN TAKE UPON HIM AS A SORT OF INCOME AND- CLOSE TO GETTING THAT. NO I AM TRYING NOT THE YOU KNOW IT'S NO PRESSURE AYE AGAIN FOR ME THE OBJECTIVE IS TO MAKE IT IS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL IMPACT. I'VE DONE IT FOR YOU SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT NINE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS HAVE RECEIVED AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX DOLLARS PER MONTH IN EMERGENCY NUTRITION ALLOTMENTS. SO ONE POINT NINE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS AYE THAT'S NOT I CAN GIVE YOU THE EXACT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD NOT ENOUGH. MULTIPLY THAT BY YOU KNOW TWO THREE FOUR PEOPLE AND IT'S A IT'S A MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU WHAT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION WITH THE DEPARTMENTS TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS TO THE EMERGENCY ALLOTMENT WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH WHICH WILL NO LONGER BE GOING TO CALIFORNIANS AND I'M WONDERING THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION OR PLAN IF- THEY ARE TO DISCONTINUE THAT AFTER APRIL SIXTEENTH HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. SURE SO I'M A LOT OF THIS REALLY IS DRIVEN BY A FEDERAL DECLARATION OF AN EMERGENCY RIGHT- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS. SORT OF BIG PICTURE IN THE VARIOUS A SUPPORT THAT HELP PROVIDE ACCESS TO FOOD SO FOR INSTANCE THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT WE WERE JUST SPEAKING OF IN TERMS OF- THE- THE FLEXIBILITY OF THOSE DOLLARS FOR FELT CALHOUN. IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO LIFT UP BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY GIVES OUR LOCAL FOOD BANKS THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE FOOD THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY RIGHT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOODS AND THIS ACTUALLY HELPS ACCOMPLISH THAT- AND IT ALSO HELPS TO BOOST LOCAL ECONOMIES RIGHT WHEN WE'RE SUPPORTING LOCAL GROWERS AND SUCH SO IT YES. IT WOULD BE A GREAT LOSS OF FOR EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS BUT WE ARE ALSO THINKING ABOUT- OTHER AREAS WHERE WE CAN ALSO FURTHER REINFORCE. I WOULD JUST PUT IT ON THE SCALE OF ITS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PER MONTH THAT'S ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE YEAR. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME INVESTMENT PURSES. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT OUR FAMILIES ARE GETTING CURRENTLY AND JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WERE. REACTING TO THE APPROPRIATE SCALE- FOR WHAT'S ON THE HORIZON. I WOULD LIKE TO TRANSITION NOW TO- KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD'S QUESTION REGARDING- NOT RECEIVING A COST OF DOING BUSINESS INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE. HE WAS HOPING TO ASK BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- FOR A RESPONSE TO THAT. AS IT APPEARS FROM WHAT WAS PRESENTED AS IF. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT MATCHING FUNDS FOR US IF WE HAS THE STATE WORK TO INCREASE THAT CONTRIBUTION- PER THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS GOING UP SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE I'M HOPING. YOU CAN PROVIDE COMMENTS TO ADDRESS THAT. TIGER WOODS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN TAKE THE FIRST PART- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS A NEED TO RE EVALUATE THAT EXISTING METHODOLOGY AND THAT WAS IN PLACE. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AS MY COUNTERPARTS TO DSS MENTIONED- AMANDA CWDM MATCH AND THE PANDEMIC. ARE WOMEN IN OUR ABILITY TO GO AHEAD AND RE EVALUATE THAT AND HAVE. A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT UNDERLYING BASIS FOR THAT METHODOLOGY WOULD BE. AND WE ARE AT OUR INTENT IS TO ENGAGE AGAIN AND NOT AS WE START TO GET OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AGAIN. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT C. W. A. R. CAN HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BASIS FOR THEIR SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST. I WE WOULD BE OPEN TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO PROVIDE A DSS THE CHANCE TO COMMENT IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO AS WELL. I THINK FURTHER TO ADD KATHY SANDERLING DONALD SAID THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HELP US TO HIRE SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED WORKERS AND AS THEY WERE GOING THROUGH ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICATIONS PER WEEK DURING THE PEAK OF THE PANDEMIC IT IS APPARENT THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUED. NEED FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE WORKERS TO EVALUATE WITHIN THIS PROGRAM AND WILL AND MY QUESTIONS WERE ACTUALLY FOCUSING HOUSE ON WHAT JAKE BREMNER SAID WITH THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. EARLIER WE HEARD ABOUT TO TAKE UP RATES AND WE HEARD THAT CALFRESH ROUGHLY HAS A 70% TAKE UP RATE AND YET IF YOU WOULD DO THE MATH PER WHAT JAKE PRESENTED TO US THAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN. THOUSAND STUDENTS OUT OF- PROXIMALLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. WHERE TO TAKE A BREAK MUCH CLOSER 225230% AND THAT REALLY SCREAMS TELL ME ABOUT THE FOOD INSECURITY THAT SO MANY STUDENTS. IN HIGHER EDUCATION MUST BE FACING TODAY AND I WOULD BRING UP MUCH LIKE WE DO WITH AND HEALTH CARE AND FOCUSING ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE SIMILARLY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATION AND- THE STUDENTS HUNGER OFTENTIMES WILL PRECLUDE THEIR- ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY BE THE STUDENTS THAT THEY NEED TO BE. SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE ADMINISTRATION HOW IT RECEIVED THAT STUDENT AID COMMISSION'S TESTIMONY AND IF THEY HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT. SIR THIRD THE DEPARTMENT AND HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT LED TO THE STOCK- REPORT HOWEVER IT'S A FAIRLY EARLY AND WE HAVE NOT CONDUCTED A COMPLETE ANALYSIS BUT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE SECOND. THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED BUT CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE CALLING OUT GERMAN ARAMBULA IN TERMS OF. THE NEED TO CONNECT STUDENTS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PUT. THERE THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME FROM MY OFFICE ON THE SUBJECT LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME REQUEST FROM THE CHAIRMAN THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC REQUESTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE FORTY ONE. I'D FIRST LIKE TO ASK KINDLY FOR DSS FOR AN ANALYSIS REGARDING CURRENT CALFRESH ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AND IF THERE IS A QUANTITATIVE SHORTFALL IN WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. AND WHAT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO MEET CASELOAD AND PROGRAMMATIC DEMANDS. TO ASSURE THAT THE CURRENT LAW CAN BE IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATELY. SECOND I WOULD LIKE AN ESTIMATE ON ACHIEVING FOOD FOR ALL AS OUTLINED WITHIN THE AGENDA. AND THIRD FOR A DISCUSSION WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE VIABLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS NEXT. WITH THAT WE I'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THE PANELISTS FOR ISSUE FOUR WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE WHERE WE WILL HAVE FOR PRESENTERS WE WILL BEGIN WITH JULIE MICK QUIDI. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ACTING BRANCH CHIEF FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. FOLLOWED BY ERIN CARSON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FLORIDA'S MORE ALICE WITH THE L. A- AND KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CWD EIGHT. LET'S BEGIN WITH MISS MCWETHY WHEN YOU'RE READY. HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. THE HEARING AGENDA INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF THESE PROGRAMS BEGINNING ON PAGE FORTY THREE SO I'LL TRY TO FOCUS MY REMARKS SPECIFICALLY ON THE QUESTIONS ASKED AND LIMIT MY PRESENTATION TO FINANCE THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT AND HISTORIC TOTAL OF MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE GRANT FUNDS TO COUNTIES ANDTRIBES TO ESTABLISH CONTINUE AND EXPAND HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT SERVE CLIENTS OF LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES. INVESTMENTS FOR ME TO EXPAND MY COWARDS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM HOME SAFE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT ROOM KEY AND WE HOUSING STRATEGY AS WELL AS TO ESTABLISH THE. COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM. AB ONE THIRTY FIVE FURTHER EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF EXISTING PROGRAMSAND THEIR POTENTIAL REACH IN PARTICULAR FOR FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING THOSE NOT IN RECEIPT. OF AN EVICTION NOTICE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE BUDGET ENACTMENT CDSS BEGAN DEVELOPING GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE STATUTORY CHANGES MADE BY AB ONE THIRTY FIVE. AND THROUGH ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THE DEPARTMENT EVALUATED LESSONS LEARNED AND PROMISING PRACTICES WHICH WERE USED TO STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND PROGRAM GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITIES PREPARED TO SCALE THEIR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS AND EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE TREMENDOUS FUNDING EXPANSIONS. THAT WERE MADE THIS BUDGET YEAR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO SUPPORT AND STABILIZE FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR HOUSING INSTABILITY WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO SERVE NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES THROUGH THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM AND BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IN ADDITION TO THESE FAMILIES PRO DECENT FAMILY PROGRAMS CDSS HAS MADE OVER NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO SERVE SENIORS AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE EXPERIENCING OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. AND GRANTEES EXPECTED SERVE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SENIORS AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES THROUGH THE HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM. AND THE HOME STATE PROGRAMS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS WITH THESE HISTORIC FUNDING EXPANSIONS. CDSS ALSO UTILIZED A PORTION OF THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO ESTABLISH COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INITIATIVES WHICH WE LAUNCHED EARLY IN EARLY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THESE ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT EXPANSION AND GROWTH OF THE CDSS FUNDED HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS STATEWIDE AND WE'RE BASED UPON THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY COUNTIES TRIBES AND ALASKA REYES STAKEHOLDERS- HOUSING INSTABILITY AND RISK OF HOMELESSNESS IS INTRINSICALLY CONNECTED. TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM ACROSS THE HOMELESS RESPONSE SYSTEM AND IDENTIFIED HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA IT'S AN AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AND FAMILY SEEKING OR IN RECEIPT OF CAL WORKS BENEFITS ARE AMONGST THOSE WHO ARE MOST ACUTELY IMPACTED BY THIS AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. THREATENING THEIR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND RETAIN HOUSING LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS REQUIRE NOT JUST HOUSING PEOPLE WHO BECOME HOMELESS BUT ALSO PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS BEFORE IT OCCURS AND A CONTINUUM OF SOLUTIONS IS CRITICAL TO MEETING MEANS. THE MEETING FAMILIES WHERE THEY ARE ACTING IN THE INTERSECTION OF BROADER SUPPORT THROUGH SOCIAL SAFETY NETS INCLUDING PREVENTION ASSISTANCE THE AB ONE THIRTY FIVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS FUNDED BY CDSS TO INCLUDE HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION INCLUDING FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS NOT IN RECEIPT OF AN EVICTION NOTICE. GRANTEES ARE BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT AND EXPAND PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE THESE ADDITIONAL HOUSING INTERVENTIONS AND CDSS LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH COUNTIES AND TRIBES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO SOLICIT FEEDBACK. AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THESE RECENT CHANGES TO CONTINUOUSLY SEEK TO IMPROVE PROGRAM OUTCOMES. SHIFTING OVER TO OUR NEWS PROGRAM THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM. THIS THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED BY AB ONE SEVENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE STATE BUDGET APPROPRIATED EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROGRAM FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR ACQUISITION CONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION TO PRESERVE AND EXPAND AND BUILT IN SENIOR CARE SETTINGS THAT SERVE AS A SITE AND HAPPY. APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING ARE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS IN JANUARY FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS MADE AVAILABLE VIA I REQUEST FOR APPLICATION OR RFA FOR CAPITAL EXPANSION PROJECTS. AN INFORMATIONAL WEBINAR WALKING THROUGH THE RFA WAS PRESENTED IN EARLY FEBRUARY AND INCLUDED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED WEAPON ARE PARTICIPANTS INTAKE DATE OVER THREE HUNDRED APPLICANTS HAVE REQUESTED FORMAL CONSULTATIONS AND ARE WORKING WITH IMPLEMENTATION SPECIALIST TO FURTHER DEVELOP THEIR PROJECTS AND SUBMIT APPLICATIONS. WE ARE MONITORING THESE CONSULTATIONS CLOSELY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND APPLICATIONS THAT WILL BE SUBMITTED AND THE NUMBER OF NEW BAGS OR UNITS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM ULTIMATELY DEPENDS ON THE TYPES OF FACILITIES ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE APPROVED AND FUND AND HOWEVER EARLY ESTIMATES PROJECT APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND BEDS WILL BE CREATED. AND THREE THOUSAND THAT'S WILL. BE PRESERVED THROUGH THESE BONDS. I'M WITH TO THE PRESERVATION FUNDS ACROSS THE STATE- CD SEE THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT A FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE OPERATING SUBSIDY PAYMENTS TO PRESERVE BEDS FOR SSI RECIPIENTS. IN LICENSE ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND THREE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING SURVEY DATA WE ESTIMATE. THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SSI. WHO WERE LIVING IN EXISTING LICENSED ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES STILL USING AN ASSUMPTION OF ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. OF OPERATING SUBSIDY PAYMENT THE FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE SPREAD OUT IN VARIOUS WAYS FOR EXAMPLE A PAYMENT COULD BE MADE TO EVERY FACILITY IN THE STATE FOR EVERY SSI RECIPIENTS. THE OPERATING SUBSIDY PAYMENTS WOULD LAST FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS HOWEVER IF A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR MONTHLY PAYMENT WERE SPREAD OVER FIVE YEARS THE FUNDING WOULD SERVE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS. RECEIVING SSI. AND FINE- THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR PRESERVATION FUNDS IS STILL BEING FINALIZED HOWEVER WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT WE WOULD USE THAT ESTIMATE OF THE PROPORTION OF THE BEDS AVAILABLE AND EXISTING LICENSE FACILITIES CURRENTLY SERVING INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SSI. NOW CONCLUDE THAT ERIN CARSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HEY ERIN CARSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS MOMENT THANKS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM LOTUS MORALIS WITH THE L. A. L. THANK YOU CAN MEMBERS NUNEZ MORALES WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND YOUR AGENDA INDICATES AND THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES RECEIVED VERY SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATIONS FOR THEIR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. BECAUSE OF THIS WE THINK YOUR FOCUS TODAY ON OVERSIGHT AND CONTINUED FOCUS ON OVERSIGHT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING THE OUTCOMES THEY ARE PRODUCING AND WHETHER THEY ARE EXPERIENCING ANY CHALLENGES GETTING THE MONEY OUT FOR GETTING THE PROGRAM SET UP. AND THAT THOSE CHALLENGES CAN BE ADDRESSED QUICKLY. WE WOULD ALSO MENTION THAT OUR OFFICE RECENTLY PUBLISHED OUR INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PACKAGE OF HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS WHICH AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND- PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. ONE OF THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE REPORT THAT IS MOST RELEVANT TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY IS THE FOCUS ON COORDINATION. TO ENSURE THAT THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF STATE PROGRAMS RELATED TO HOUSING HOMELESSNESS WORK EFFECTIVELY TOGETHER. AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS CLICK INTO THE OVERALL APPROACH. IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I'M ON THAT NOTE WE HAVE REVIEWED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR POSITIONS TO ASSIST WITH THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH IS NOTED ON THE AGENDA TODAY. AND WE HAVE NO CONCERNS AS WE SEE IT AS AN IMPORTANT. BOTH FOR OVERSIGHT AS WELL AS COORDINATION EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD'S WITH CEDAR BDA. FRAN HELLO AGAIN- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY FROM GOING TO COUNTY WTA. THE FIRST QUESTION THE INTERNET IS RELATED TO HOW- COUNTIES ARE DOING WITH THE FUNDING AND- I FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT THE EXPANSION FROM THE CURRENT YEAR ARE TRULY IMPRESSIVE THAT AND WE WERE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE RECOGNITION THAT COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION UNDERSTAND HOUSING RELATED NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WE SERVING HEALTH PRACTICE SORRY. I IN CAN'T TELL WELFARE CAL WORKS AND THE BILL PROTECTION AS WELL AND THAT SIGNIFICANT VALUE THAT EACH STAFF OFFERS TO SENIORS AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. AS YOU KNOW WE'VE DISCUSSED THE INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE IT ALL OF THOSE UNDERLYING PROGRAMS ARE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO WORK IF SOMEONE IS ANNOUNCED OR AT RISK OF ADDICTION. OR HOMELESSNESS UNFORTUNATELY I THINK AS YOU'VE HEARD AND NOW ANTICIPATE ALL SAY THEY COUNTIES ONLY RECENTLY BEEN ABLE TO BEGIN SPENDING THE INCREASES BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO HAVE AN ALLOCATION GRADING. AND INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SPEND THE FUNDING AND I ESPECIALLY THE CHANGES THAT WERE ADOPTED RELATED TO PREVENTION ESPECIALLY EVICTION PREVENTION. AND SO- WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE ALL COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS LETTERS FOR EACH OF THE FUNDING- STREAMS FOR EACH PROGRAM THEY TOOK TIME FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP AN ISSUE- AS YOU KNOW AND THE LAST ONE FOR BRINGING FAMILY'S HOME IN OUR CHILD WELFARE AREA WAS POSTED ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO ON FEBRUARY A LOT. OF THE FAMED OUR OUR PARTNERS THE TVS THAT'S WORK CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET AND THE HOUSING AREA IT IS ABSOLUTELY NO WORKS EXCEPTION EVERYONE OF THE PROGRAM RECEIVED A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE SAYS AND THIS IS ALSO AN AREA OF RELATIVELY RECENT EXPANSION FOR CVS ANYWAY. SO THEY DEFINITELY NEEDED TO ENSURE THE FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE AND THAT THE NEW RULES WERE PROPERLY COMMUNICATED IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. THAT IT TOOK AWHILE EVEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN FOR A TRADING AT TIMES THINK FOR ALL OF THAT. I SAY THT THE THAT YOU MAY RECALL OUR- OF MORE YEAR PERIOD. WHICH WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH OF THE- IN IT TURNS. WAS A REALLY GOOD BOTH AS WELL DEFINITELY ROLLING FOR. AND THEM OVER. YEARS NOW THAT COUNTIES HAVE THE- ON HOW MUCH THEY'RE WORTH THE- THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE THE PROCESS OF AMENDING CONTRACTS LOCALLY WITH PROVIDERS. ENTERING INTO NEW CONTRACTS. IN LIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE OF DENTAL INCREASE SAYS AND THEN IMPLEMENTING THE NEW ABILITY TO USE FUNDS ON. PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. I WAS OFF LAST COMMENT ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AS WELL FROM THE FLEXIBILITIES OF THE SELECT FEET TO SPEND THE FUNDS- CERTAINLY QUICKLY AND MAYBE AT ALL IN SOME CASES THOUGH I THINK- SPEED IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE. IS JUST- A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK THAT'S AVAILABLE WE KNOW THAT WE ARE FACING THAT ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE IT'S NOT JUST A LARGER URBAN AREA IS SMALLER COUNTIES RURAL COUNTIES IN OUR SUBURBAN COUNTIES ALL REPORT. THAT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIND AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND ALL SAY THAT I THINK DURING THE PANDEMIC EVEN THOUGH THE EVICTION MORATORIUM WHICH WE STRONGLY SUPPORT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD THING FOR RENTERS- FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AFFECTED OR ARE HOMELESS. I MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND A PLACE FOR THEM IT'S MADE RENTS HIGHER OVERALL BUT THEY CAN'T FIND A VACANCY SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE IN THE GENERAL HOUSING MARKET OR THINGS THAT. COUNTIES ARE GRAPPLING WITH AS WELL AS THEY TRY TO FIND A PLACE FOR SOMEONE TO WHATEVER- I WILL SAY THAT WE'RE JUST SO GRATEFUL AS WELL TO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED. A MAJOR CHANGE TO ENABLE US TO USE FUNDS PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT OF AN EVICTION NOTICE WE KNOW THAT AFFECTION IS SO DAMAGING TO FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. IT LEADS TO JOB LOSSES NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND- BUT THE FICTION ACTUALLY LEAD TO JOB LOSS FOR PEOPLE. CHILDREN HAVE TO CHANGE ALL OF OUR STARTERS ON THE SIDEWALK IN A BAG- HERE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IT'S JUST A TREMENDOUSLY BAD FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES SO WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. A FEW THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT LAST YEAR BUT THAT WE I DIDN'T GET IT AND WITH LIKE A LOVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION. ARE GREATER ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING OR MAINTAINING HELPING WHICH- WOULD INCLUDE YOUR FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT SECURITY DEPOSIT SHORT AND LONG TERM RENTAL SUBSIDIES SERVICES TO HELP CLIENTS TRANSITION. FROM PERHAPS THE SHELTER OR A CAR INTO HOUSING. THEY MAY NEED SUPPLIES AND OTHER THINGS ORDER TO DO TO MAKE THE TRANSIT. I'M SECURING TEMPORARY OR- HOUSING- INCLUDING- AT A INTO LEASE AGREEMENT ARE FOR TEMPER DWELL UNITS. AND SECURING OUR PROPERTY THAT WE CAN YEAR OR MAKE AVAILABLE TO OTHER. ON SERVICE PROVIDERS YEARS AS TEMPORARY HER VERGE OF THE HOUSING. ALSO SOMEONE THAT OUT IN THEIR ON THE STREET. I'M WORKING WITH LANDLORDS TO TRY TO INCREASE THE ABILITY OF HOUSING UNITS AND- I'M HELPING AWARE THERE ARE PERHAPS GAPS IN LEGAL ASSISTANCE. FOR SOMEONE WHO MAY BE FACING AFFECTION. THERE'S ANOTHER ARE PROGRAM SPECIFIC IDEAS THAT WE HAVE WOULD CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE AS WELL AS THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL JUST. STOP THERE THANK EVERYONE AGAIN FOR THE HARD WORK IN PUTTING THINGS OUT AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT TO REALLY BE ABLE TO TAKE AND SPEND THESE FUNDS AND- ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN STAY HOUSE AND GET HOUSE. IF THEY ARE ARE HOMELESS NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BRING IT BACK UP TO THE- AND KEEPING HERE THE CHAIR- I I'D LIKE TO START WITH MISS MCWETHY A FIGHT CAN- THE SECOND QUESTION WE GET ASKED IN THE AGENDA. REALLY WAS REVOLVING AROUND HOW DSS HAD REPORTED THAT AN ESTIMATED 85% OF FAMILIES. WHO ARE TOUCHING THE HOMELESS SYSTEM. ARE RECEIVING OR WERE RECENTLY RECEIVING CAL WORKS. I'M HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME COMMENTARY ON WHAT YOU BELIEVE THIS TELLS US. ABOUT THE NEEDS WITH AND CAL WORKS AS A PROGRAM. THAT'S ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS POVERTY AND SHOULD BE HELPING US TO REDUCE THE INFLOW INTO HOMELESSNESS. AND HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SOAS MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS HOUSING INSTABILITY AND RISK OF HOMELESSNESS IS INTRINSICALLY CONNECTED TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIP SO THIS DATA POINT CAME OUT OF RESEARCH FROM THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB. AND STUDIES THAT THEY WERE DOING AND LOS ANGELES AND WHAT WE BELIEVE THIS MEANS IS THAT BECAUSE THAT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA ISSUE IS REALLY THE DRIVER OF HOMELESSNESS FAMILIES THAT ARE RECEIVING THAT HAVE LOW INCOME ARE AT GREATER RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE SMALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY INCIDENCE HOMELESSNESS PREVIOUSLY ARE AT GREATER RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS SO WHAT WE CAN SEE FROM THAT IS THAT. M. BY EIGHT BY. CONNECTING FAMILIES DIRECTLY TO HOUSING SUPPORTS THROUGH THE HUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM AND THEY'RE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM AS WELL AS UTILIZATION OF LIKE HOW WORKS HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT AND SUPPORT FAMILIES AND HOW WORKS PROGRAM. WITH HOUSING INSTABILITY. I WILL WITH YOU- THAT I BELIEVE MUCH OF THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE IS AN AFFORDABILITY ISSUE BUT WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE PROGRAM. THE ASSISTANCE WITH WHICH THEY WERE JUST RECEIVING IF WITHIN A MONTH OF THEM BEING OFF THE PROGRAM THERE THEN HOMELESS. ARE THEY RECEIVING ENOUGH SUPPORT. OR IS THE SUPPORT MAKING IT ON AFFORDABLE FOR THEM TO RETAIN AND KEEP THEIR HOUSING AS I BELIEVE THAT THE FAMILIES WERE SEEING WHO ARE BECOMING HOMELESS ASSISTANCE. EITHER CURRENTLY OR RIGHT BEFORE THEY BECOME HOMELESS REALLY SCREAMS TO ME ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED SO WE CAN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BEFORE IT OCCURS. WE'VE HEARD FROM KATHY SANDERLING MACDONALD HOW IT'S TREMENDOUSLY BAD FOR FAMILIES THAT THE TRANSITION THE CHANGING OF SCHOOLS THE RISK TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT THAT I'M REALLY WANTING US TO DIG IN AND FIGURE OUT WHAT OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORTS WE CAN. BE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE INTERACTING WITH THEIR CAL WORK SYSTEMS ARE NOT BECOMING HOMELESS THAT DATA POINT IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING FOR ME AND ONE IN WHICH I'M HOPEFUL TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM OR THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WITH AND CAL WORKS I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP TO STRENGTHEN. THE PROGRAMS ETHER- FOR THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE OR FOR THE LONG TERM ASSISTANCE AND I AND I WILL JUST MORE BROADLY SAY I BELIEVE THIS IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE EFFORTS WITHIN CALLIE IN AS WELL THE EFFORTS WE HAVE FOR INLAND SERVICES TO LOOK TOWARDS HOUSING TRANSITION NAVIGATION AND HOUSING DEPOSIT SAY I WOULD LIKE TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER WE CAN APPLY THAT FOR FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT AS WELL FOR THOSE WITH AND CAL WORKS AND- WOULD ALSO POINT TO THE- FIFTY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BOLD INITIATIVES- AS I BELIEVE MANY OF THOSE ISSUES RELATED TO BOTH CHILD AND MATERNAL OUTCOMES. THAT ARE BEING PUSHED BY THE ADMINISTRATION CAN BE IMPROVED TO FOR STRENGTHENING THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND PREVENTING FAMILIES FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WOULD APPRECIATE A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN THOSE PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR MEDICAL WITH THAT. ONE ONE OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS JUST DEAD THEN WORK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING TO BRING ON. MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES AND THE WORK AT THE DEPARTMENT'S DOING WITH OTHER HOUSING AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE COORDINATED AND THEIR- FAMILIES IN THE HOW WORK SYSTEM. HAVE ACCESS TO PERMANENT HOUSING THROUGH WHETHER IT BE HUNKY PROJECTS OR OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING ON- IN A KNOWLEDGE BEING WET- MISGENDERING DONALD. NOTED ABOUT THAT FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT AND FLEXIBILITIES AND- DIFFERENT BED THE GUIDANCE THAT WE DID WORK ON OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS DOES INCLUDE- AVAILABILITY OF THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN ORDER FOR. ALL FAMILIES SERVED THROUGH THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM TO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO- HOUSING ASSISTANCE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I BELIEVE ALL WERE TRYING TO ASK FOR IS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REALITY. AND THE DEPARTMENT'S ANALYSIS ON WHY THIS IS HAPPENING SO WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS GOING FORWARD. WITH THAT I WILL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS PANEL AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO- ISSUE SIX WHERE WE WILL HAVE SIX PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL. BEGINNING WITH ELIANA HI MORE IT'S IMMIGRATION INTEGRATION BRANCH CHIEF FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. FOLLOWED BY MAUREEN KEFFER CIVIL RIGHTS ACCESSIBILITY AND RACIAL EQUITY OFFICE CHIEF FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. FOLLOWED BY A NON NON NAY BECAUSE HE PRINCIPLE PROGRAM BUDGET ANALYST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE L. A. O. JACKIE GONZALEZ WITH POLICY DIRECTOR FOR IMMIGRANTS DEFENSE ADVOCATES AND CYNTHIA CHOI CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND FOUNDING PARTNERS. OF STOP AP I HATE LET'S BEGIN WITH MISS COMMA WHAT'S WITH THE DEPARTMENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON THAT I'M GLAD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ADRIANA CAME WHEN I AM THE IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION BRANCH CHIEF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS FOR THE HEARING TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF OUR IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE STAFFING REQUESTS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROGRAMS. SO IF IT'S HELPFUL I AM GOING TO BE MOVING STRAIGHT INTO ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS POSED FOR THIS ITEM. FIRST QUESTION WAS. IN REGARDS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FACING IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. AND HOW ARE FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE OPERATING TO SERVE THESE NEEDS. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OUR REFUGEES OF EXPERIENCE FIVE YEARS OF CONSTANTLY CHANGING IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT HAVE AFFECTED NOT ONLY THOSE SEEKING TO ENTER AND RECENT NEWCOMERS BUT ALSO MANY IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE LIVED IN OUR- COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES. IN A REPORT ISSUED THIS MONTH THE NATIONAL MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE HAD A LOT OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO FEDERAL IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHICH COLLECTIVELY THE REPORT STATES. AND I QUOTE NARROWED GRANT OF HUMANITARIAN PROTECTION INCREASED ENFORCEMENT AND MADE LEGAL IMMIGRATION MORE DIFFICULT. AS THE REPORT NOTES THESE FEDERAL ACTIONS BIG AND SMALL NOT ONLY DISRUPTED THE LIVES OF IMMIGRANTS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THEY ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN THE ENTIRE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN SOME OF THESE POLICIES AND REGULATORY CHANGES MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO UNDO. TODAY'S CALIFORNIA'S TODAY CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANTS BASED LONG BACKLOGS AND EXTENDED WAIT TIMES WHEN THEY APPLIED FOR IMMIGRATION BENEFITS SUCH AS DACA AND GREEN CARDINALS CITIZENSHIP APPLICATIONS PETITIONS TO BRING FAMILY MEMBERS FROM ABROAD. AT THE US CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES ALSO KNOWN AS USCIS. THE COOPER NINETEEN RELATED CLOSURES OF FEDERAL USCIS OFFICES SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICES IN IMMIGRATION COURTS EXACERBATED EXISTING DELAYS IN PROCESSING DOCUMENTS IMMIGRANTS NEED IN THEIR DAILY LIVES TO APPLY FOR JOBS. SEEK PUBLIC BENEFITS AND DELAYED THE ADJUDICATION OF IMMIGRATION REMEDIES IN THE COURTS THAT MIGHT ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES. MANY OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICIES ALONG WITH GOVERNOR NUISANCE. IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS TO PUBLIC BENEFITS AND LESSEN THE FEAR OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AND DEPORTATION. HOWEVER THE WILLINGNESS TO TRUST OF IMMIGRANTS TO ACCESS GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS MAY TAKE LONGER TO BE BUILT BACK UP. GIVEN THE CRUCIAL GROW CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT PLAN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR COMEDY IN OUR ECONOMY THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED STATE BUDGET INVESTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE SAFETY NET FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ENSURE ACCESS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. CALIFORNIA'S HISTORIC EXPANSION OF MEDICARE OUT TO ENSURE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ALONG WITH THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF FOOD ASSISTANCE TO UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS ARE KEY STEPS IN BUILDING UP THE TRUST THE GOVERNMENT SERVICES SEEK TO SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS OF PRO BONO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO ENSURING IMMIGRANTS ARE SUPPORTED IN THEIR JOURNEY TOWARD US CITIZENSHIP AND AUTHORIZED IMMIGRATION STATUS. ULTIMATELY ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS MANY CALIFORNIANS IMMIGRANTS FACED WITH THE LACK OF A PATHWAY TO LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENCY AND US CITIZENSHIP. FROM IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION PERSPECTIVE HAVING A GREEN CARD AND US CITIZENSHIP IS A KEY STEP THAT ALLOWS FOREIGN BORN INDIVIDUALS TO FULLY ACCESS ALL THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC BENEFITS AND SERVICES AFFORDED TO OUR RESIDENTS. AS WE KNOW IMMIGRANTS FOREIGN BORN CALIFORNIANS CRAP COMPRISE 27% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION AND A THIRD OF OUR LABOR. FORCE WHAT HAPPENED WHILE CHILDREN CALIFORNIA HAVE LEAST ONE IMMIGRANT PARENTS. AS WE RE IMAGINE LIFE AFTER THE PANDEMIC AND ARE RESET WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ENSURE THE POISON INTERESTED IMMIGRANTS ARE INCLUDED IN ALL OF OUR STATE POLICY CONVERSATIONS AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY HOUSING EDUCATION HEALTH CARE SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS FOR ALL OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. TO CONTINUE OR BEGIN TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. THE SECOND. QUESTION PERSON THE AGENDA WITH WITH REGARDS TO THE WHAT ASPECTS OF THE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE NETWORK IS MOST LIMITED. AND WHERE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AND EXPANSION. LAST YEAR IS CONGRESS CONSIDERED SEVERAL LARGE PIECES OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE BUILD BACK BETTER PROPOSAL THERE WAS HOPE THAT THERE THAT SOME FORM OF IMMIGRATION REFORM A POTENTIAL PATHWAY TO LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENCE. RESIDENCY OR CITIZENSHIP FOR CERTAIN GROUPS WOULD BE INCLUDED IT SIGNED INTO LAW. IN PREPARATION FOR THIS POSSIBILITY THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER FUNDERS BEGAN TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY BASED LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDER NETWORK TO PROVIDE IMMIGRATION SERVICES ON A LARGER SCALE IF IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAME A REALITY. IN OUR ASSESSMENT WE FOUND THAT MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM THE DESTRUCTION WROUGHT BY THE PANDEMIC AND ARE STILL FINDING WAYS TO DELIVER SERVICES ONLINE AND IN PERSON ON A LARGER SCALE. EVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDING THE SMALL NUMBER OF IMMIGRATION LAWYERS IN CALIFORNIA. COMPARED TO THE NEED THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND CAPACITY BY CONSIDERING INCREASED FUNDING OF ACCREDITED REPRESENTATIVES WHO COULD HELP IMMIGRANTS NAVIGATE IMMIGRATION BENEFITS APPLICATION PROCESS THESE. THERE'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR THOSE SEEKING TO SERVE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SUCH AS INTERPRETERS COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. WE WILL LOOK TO CONTINUE. TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES. TO BUILD UP COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE NETWORKS AND I TRAIN AND MY LINK MIGHT MULTI CALLED COP WHY TO ADVANCE WORK. WE WANT TO BE OUR EMIGRATE INTO AND- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SHARE THESE RESPONSE TODAY AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAPPEN QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MAUREEN TOUGHER. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MAUREEN KEPT HER AND I AM THE CHIEF OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACCESSIBILITY AND RACIAL EQUITY OFFICE AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I'LL BE ADDRESSING SPECIFICALLY THE QUESTION. ON THE AGENDA AROUND THE HEAT INCIDENTS SURVIVOR AND PREVENTION SERVICES PROGRAM BUT THEN IT THE PROGRAM IS COMPRISED OF A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OVER THREE YEARS FOR GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF HATE INCIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND ENGAGE IN PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. THE PROGRAM IS BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSION ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICAN AFFAIRS CDSS AND THE COMMISSION HELD A SERIES OF LISTENING SESSIONS IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH PARTICIPATION FROM OVER A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS AND STAKEHOLDERS PROVIDING INPUT ON THAT NEEDS GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN AREAS OF ANTI HATE SERVICES AND PREVENTION. THERE WERE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN AREAS OF CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LEGAL SERVICES NAVIGATION RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND ALTERNATIVES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT YOUTH DEVELOPMENT SENIOR SAFETY AND A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS. AS A RESULT OF THIS INFORMATION GATHERING AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CDSS ISSUED AN RFA FOR THE STOCK I HATE PROGRAM FOR UP TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS INCORPORATING INPUT FROM THE COMMISSION AND FROM THESE LISTENING SESSIONS. APPLICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW AND AWARDS ARE ANTICIPATED IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. AT SOME A TRAY. GRANT AWARDS WILL BE MADE BY INVITATION TO ORGANIZATIONS WITH A DEMONSTRATED CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER LARGE SCALE ANTI HATE SERVICE OF A PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND THESE AWARDS ARE ALSO EXPECTED THIS SPRING. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON NINETY FIVE THE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT NO FURTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE L. L. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN RYAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME VEHICLE FOR QUESTIONS. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JACKIE GONZALEZ POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE IMMIGRANT DEFENSE ADVOCATES. MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- WE JACQUI GONZALEZ POLICY DIRECTOR WITH IMMIGRANT DEFENSE ADVOCATE AND DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE FOR THIS INVITATION I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IT'S MADE ON ISSUES OF EQUITY AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE ESPECIALLY DURING THAT TIME ONCE WE'VE HEARD TODAY WE'RE ALL THINKING ABOUT CHALLENGES RELATED TO RACIAL JUSTICE AND IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS AND IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO THANK CDSS- FOR ALWAYS BEING WILLING TO PARTNER AND ENGAGE WITH ADVOCATES AND EXPLORING STICKS SOLUTION TO THESE ISSUES I CAN SAY I'VE BEEN ADVOCATE- FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW CDSS HAS CONSISTENTLY MOVED SWIFTLY AND MAKE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WHERE IT COULD TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. PARTICULARLY UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION- SOME OF THE MYRIAD WAYS PROVIDING SUPPORT AT THE BORDER MIGRANT SHELTERS DOC ASSISTANCE IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES TO THAT PROGRAM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND MORE RECENTLY THROUGH TARGETED INVESTMENTS LIKE THE BLACK IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE EQUITY PROJECT I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES- AND INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MOST TO CHECK ON THAT I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON TODAY IT'S THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION LEGAL FELLOWSHIP WHICH LAUNCHED JUST LAST YEAR. THE FELLOWSHIP IS AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO A CHALLENGE THAT HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES IN OUR STATE AND AS OF THE ON THAT AS- IT'S KIND OF IT'S MENTIONED I'M PASSED THE LACK OF LEGAL RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY DEPORTATION DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IN UNDERSERVED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY. ISOLATED REGIONS OF OUR STATE. ASIAN DEFENSE IS A THE CENTER TOOL- NEEDED TO FOR. AND OF THE COMMUNITY MANY OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN UNDER. REGIONS OF OUR STATE- AS THE CHAIRMAN KNOWS FAR TOO WELL GIVEN- HIS DISTRICT AND TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER AND FRIDAY EIGHT. TWENTY NINETEEN AT THE HEIGHT O THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S AGGRESSIVE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT POLICIES CALIFORNIA INVESTED IN THIS PROJECT AS A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR THE CODE. COULD GAIN ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS AND QUALITY DEPORTATION DEFENSE SERVICES. AT A MASS DEPORTATION AND VIOLATIONS OF DUE PROCESS CERTAINLY DON'T DOMINATE OUR HEADLINES BUT THE NEED HAS NOT ABATED. AND IT REMAINS AN EVER PRESSING CHALLENGE FOR CALIFORNIA. IF INCREDIBLE TO NOTE THAT JUST THIS PAST WINTER BETWEEN OCTOBER AND DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE NATIONWIDE IMMIGRATION COURT BACKLOG THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER SAW THE LARGEST SPIKE IN HISTORY. WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND NEW CASES ADDED TO ITS DOCKET AS A ROOT DIRECTORS ALL OF THE- ARRESTS BY ICE. AND MOST NOTABLY FOR CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS I LAKE IMMIGRATION COURT SAW THE LARGEST INCREASE IN CASES ACROSS THE NATION. AND SO MANY OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE RURAL REGIONS OF OUR STATE. INCLUDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND CENTRAL COAST ARE AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THIS COURT TO APPEAR A LOAN WITH NO LEGAL ASSISTANCE. SO WE HAVEN'T WORKED FOR YEARS- TO TRY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND HAVE I THINK BECOMING A REALLY GOOD PLACE WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTION TO THIS GAP IS A COLLABORATIVE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. THAT DEVELOPS A PIPELINE OF IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS I CAN BE TRAINED AND MENTORED BY HIGHLY SKILLED ORGANIZATIONS IN MORE URBAN AREAS AND IN HOUSE IN BEES- MORE RURAL AREAS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS IT ONLY TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES IN THESE REGIONS HAVE CONTINUED LAWYERS BY THEIR SIDE BUT THAT WE MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS LONGER TERM STATE FUNDING OF WHICH WE JUST HEARD THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT UNDER ONE CALIFORNIA. AND ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE- THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THREE YEARS APPROVAL TO REMOVAL DEFENSE EXPERIENCE TO ACCESS- THIS REMATCH FUNDING AND THE FELLOWSHIP DOES JUST THAT HE TRAINS THE NEXT GENERATION OF ATTORNEYS WILL ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOOD INTENTIONS ARE ABLE. TO CONTINUE ON TO HOW THESE COMMUNITY BOYER'S AND BE A TO PROVIDE THESE CREEK SERVICE. AND SINCE THE- YOUR TEN- JUST A YEAR AGO THAT FELLOWS ASSISTED HUNDRED OF FAN. ACROSS THE VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL COAST PROVIDING THEM WITH LEGAL CONSULTATIONS. AND REPRESENTATION AND BOND AND REMOVAL CASES OFTEN INVOLVING MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS AND UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. AND I KNOW THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT PANELS- THIS AFTERNOON YOU KNOW WE'VE NOTED HOW IMPORTANT THE ISSUE OF LEGAL STATUS IS FOR ACCESSING. YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF SERVICES. AND BENEFITS AND IT'S NOT JUST THE ISSUE OF LEGAL STATUS WHEN FOLKS ARE FACING DEPORTATION IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST STRESSFUL EVENTS IN THEIR LIVES I'M IT'S NOT ONLY THE ISSUE OF THE LACK OF THE WILL STATUS. IT'S REALLY THE THREAT OF BEING SEPARATED FROM FAMILY MEMBERS- LOSING A BREADWINNER AND BEING DEPORTED TO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE FACE YOU KNOW AND MANY MANY CIRCUMSTANCES TORTURE OR THE WORST CASE IS. THAT AND THAT'S THE REASON THE ADVOCATES AND LEGISLATORS ARE COMING TOGETHER IN THIS YEAR TO ASK FOR CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM TO PROTECT ON THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. THE OTHER QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS AND I WILL TRY TO WRAP UP I'M IN STATE WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT IS- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES SURROUNDING I'M LEGAL SERVICES AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER CALIFORNIA'S WAIT. FOR THE GAME WE'RE SO LUCKY TO BE IN A STATE WHERE BOTH- OUR GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING. AND PROTECTING OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE CONTINUE TO FACE IS HOW TO BE EXPAND THE POOL. OF INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN ACCESS- THESE SERVICES. AND LIKE I MENTIONED TRADITIONALLY YOU HAVE ORGANIZATIONS IN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM FUNDING BUT LACKS THE ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY. TO QUALIFY FOR THE FUNDING AND THAT'S WHERE PROGRAMS LIKE THE FELLOWSHIP PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. WITHIN THEIR AREAS OF THE LAW ADVOCATES BELIEVE THERE'S ROOM TO INVOLVE OUR CURRENT STATUTE AND ALSO OUR FUNDING MODELS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN TABLED- ON THESE ISSUES INCLUDING MOVING FROM WHAT'S CALLED A FEW PER CASE MODEL- TO A FULL TIME STAFFING MODEL TO ENABLE ORGANIZATIONS- TO KEEP STAFF ON LONGER TERM AS A SPECIALIZED IN THESE ISSUES AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING. ADVOCATES AND CDSS HAVE BEEN EXPLORING AND ENGAGING ON. AS WELL AS EXPANDING RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT NO FAMILIES ARE DEPORTED BASED ON PRIOR UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONVICTIONS- AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THE ISSUE THE FACING DOUBLE JEOPARDY SOMETIMES. AND SO IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK CDSS ONCE AGAIN- AND YOU KNOW THREE YEARS AGO I APPEARED BEFORE THE SAME COMMITTEE CHAMPIONING THIS FELLOWSHIP- MANY PEOPLE THAT WILL BE EXPECTING YOU SHOULD WOULD BE POSSIBLE. AND I'M REALLY PROUD AND HUMBLED TO SHARE HOW SUCCESSFUL THE LAUNCH HAS BEEN AND WE ASK THAT WE HAVE TODAY THAT THE STATE CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH ADVOCATES DEFINE THESE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS TO EQUITY GAPS. THE PROGRAM IN THESE INVESTMENTS SYMBOLIZE WATER FLOWING FROM THE LAWS OF OUR STATE TO BRIDGES THAT I THINK CAN BEEN TRULY DESERT'S WHEN IT CAME TO IMMIGRATION SERVICES. AND HAVING THIS I FIND CONTINUE TO FLOW TO THESE REGIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO NOT ONLY IMPACT THOUSANDS. OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN THE FUTURE BUT TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THESE REGIONS REALLY ARE ABLE TO ACCESS JUSTICE AND EQUITY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL GO TO CYNTHIA CHOI CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND THE FOUNDING PARTNER OF. STOP AP I HATE. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS. OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS TWO REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. OF OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANTI ÁP I HATE INVESTMENT MADE IN TWENTY TWO IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. AND WHAT WERE THE OUTCOMES- THAT WAS THAT FROM THIS FUNDING. AND SECONDLY WHAT ARE THE TRENDS YOU'RE SEEING AND WHAT ARE THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR DATA. UP WITH REGARD TO ANTI API HATE INCIDENTS AND HOW CAN THE STATE'S RESPONSE BE IMPROVED. A I WHERE WHERE THE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM THE FINAL SPEAKER SO ALLOW ME TO START MY BRIEF REMARKS BY THINKING. OF YOU FOR THE HISTORIC A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX MILLION INVESTMENT IN WHICH A HUNDRED AND TEN WILL GO DIRECTLY TOWARDS COMMUNITY BASED RESPONSES TO HATE. WE KNOW THIS WORK WILL TAKE TIME. AND WILL JUST BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE UNDER INVESTMENTS IN CRITICAL HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MEETS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE LIMITED ENGLISH- SPEAKING IMMIGRANTS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEN COMMUNITY IN COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HATE. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGH OUR DATA AND WHAT ELSE THE STATE CAN DO TO ADDRESS HATE. SINCE WE LAUNCHED IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY WE ESTABLISH THAT AND TASIA RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA IS SYSTEMIC AND PERVASIVE. AND AS WE APPROACH OUR TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT WE'VE DOCUMENTED OVER TEN THOUSAND INCIDENTS. AND IT CONTINUES UNABATED. AND WHILE WE RECEIVED INCIDENTS FROM ALL FIFTY STATES IN THE NATION. CALIFORNIA HAS THE DUBIOUS DISTINCTION OF LEADING IN INCIDENTS REPORTED IN FACT CALIFORNIA MAKES UP NEARLY FORTY PERCENT. OF ALL OUR INCIDENTS. WE HAVE ALSO FOUND DISTURBING TRENDS WOMEN REPORTED ALMOST TWICE AS MANY INCIDENTS AS MEN. MANY OF THE INCIDENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RACIALIZED AND SEXUALIZED VERBAL HARASSMENT. AND THE MAJORITY ARE TAKING PLACE IN SPACES THAT ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC NAMELY STREETS SIDEWALKS PRIVATE BUSINESSES AND ON PUBLIC TRANSIT NOT JUST DATA POINTS BUT REAL PEOPLE AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU JUST A HANDFUL OF STORIES WHICH I MUST WARN YOU ARE HARD TO HEAR BUT CAN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE HARM THIS TYPE OF VERBAL HARASSMENT CAUSES. EVEN WHEN NOT DIRECTED. AT YOU. THE DUDE WAS HARASSING ME ON THE TRAIN STATION AND CALLED ME A **** THE SAME TRAIN BUT WASN'T SATISFIED AND FOLLOWED ME CAR TO CAR SO I GOT UP EARLY AND HOPPED ON THE TRAIN. FOR MY SAFETY AND OTHERS. A SECOND INCIDENT I WAS VERBALLY HARASSED FOR TEN PLUS MINUTES ON THE MUNY. BUS BY A MAN CALLING ME A CHINKO REPEATEDLY YELLING HOW HE'S HAPPY ASIAN PEOPLE ARE GETTING BEATEN UP ROBBED AND KILLED- I DESERVE IT. I'M NOTHING COULD STOP HIM IF HE WANTED TO STEAL MY THINGS OR HURT ME. AND THE FINAL INCIDENT THAT I WANT TO SHARE AS I WAS SHOPPING AT A STORE WITH MY MASK ON. AN OLDER WHITE MAN CAME UP AND STARTED SCREAMING AT ME. YOU NEED TO STAY TEN FEET AWAY FROM ME YOU DISGUSTING BAD EATING **** YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM. WELL OUR DATA CENTERS ON THE EXPERIENCES OF API WOMEN STREET HARASSMENT IS A PERNICIOUS CULTURAL NORMS THAT EXIST LARGELY UNCHECKED IN UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY. AND AFFECTS ALL WOMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. STREET HARASSMENT THREATENS THE SAFETY OF WOMEN AND OTHER GROUPS AND RESTRICTS OUR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THE ABILITY TO MOVE FREELY THROUGH PUBLIC SPACES IS CENTRAL TO OUR ECONOMY WELLBEING AND ABILITY TO CARE FOR OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES. DESPITE THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES AND DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON ALL WOMEN AND OTHER GROUPS STREET HARASSMENT IS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AND EXIST ON THE PERIPHERY OF PUBLIC POLICY SOLUTIONS. MEANWHILE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS PROHIBIT GENDER BASED HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE AND IN EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS. AS UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION. JUST IMAGINE THAT OUR BEST SOCIETAL RESPONSE IS FOR GIRLS WOMEN AND SEXUAL MINORITIES TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES TO NAVIGATE THE WORLD ACCEPTING THAT STREET HARASSMENT IS JUST PART OF OUR DAILY LIVES AND THAT OUR CHOICES WILL BE LIMITED IN ORDER TO BE SAFE. FOR LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF ESSENTIAL AND FRONTLINE WORKERS THE CHOICES ARE EVEN MORE LIMITED. WE FIND THIS-UNACCEPTABLE AND HAVE SET OUT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH OUR FIRST EVER POLICY OBJECTIVE FEATURING THREE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND HATE AND HARASSMENT. USING A PUBLIC HEALTH FRAME AND A GENDER BASED APPROACH. FIRST WE MUST N. STREET ARREST MEANT TO EDUCATION BASED INITIATIVES. SECONDLY WE HAVE TO ADDRESS PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERS SAFETY THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE JOURNEY RIGHTS PROTECTIONS IN LARGE RETAILERS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF WORKERS AND CUSTOMERS. ALL THREE BILLS WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENTS ROUGHLY THIRTY TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS EACH. A SMALL INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT AFFECTS THE OVERALL WELL BEING OF WOMEN GIRLS AND OTHERS WHO ARE BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY STREET HARASSMENT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON ADDRESSING GENDER BASED STREET HARASSMENT WHEREVER IT OCCURS. BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HATE. IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND OF I WILL- FREESHEET ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE THAT IS A GREAT SUMMARY FOR THIS ENTIRE PANEL WHERE YOU ENDED PAYER AND- WILL- POINT OUT FOR- MISS JACKIE GONZALEZ- THAT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT CALIFORNIA IS AHEAD OF THE GAME BY THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE AND- HOW WE THEN BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT MANY OF. THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND WOULD LIKE TO UPLIFT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THE- IMMIGRANT- LEGAL JUSTICE FELLOWSHIP PROJECT AS I DO BELIEVE IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN CREATE SUSTAINABILITY GOING FORWARD AS MANY OF OUR CBO LACKED THE ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY. TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES FACING OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR US TO WORK ON AND WOULD SIMPLY HIGHLIGHT THAT WHILE THIS. FELLOWSHIP PROJECT AND COHORT IS BASED OUT OF THE NINE. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR US TO SIMILARLY LOOK TOWARDS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN LIGHT OF THE LARGEST SPIKE WE SAW OCCURRING WITHIN THE L. A. IMMIGRATION COURT. AND SO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE SIMILARLY PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF. SUPPORT TO ALL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA- BUT WILL SAY THAT I SPOKE WITH THE FELLOWS OF THIS COHORT AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH BOTH THEIR DEDICATION AND- A WILLINGNESS. TO UNDERTAKE AND TO PRACTICE AND TO HELP TO DEFEND OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IT WAS- IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT FOR MANY OF US WHO WORK IN THIS AREA TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE PAYING OFF. AND THAT THERE ARE REINFORCEMENTS ON THE HORIZON AND BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT INVESTMENT FOR US TO BE MAKING.
