THE IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN ON POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. WE HAVE ALL HEARD VARIOUS ISSUES THAT OUR STUDENTS ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY AND STAFF HAVE ENDURED AND CONTINUE TO INDOOR DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THIS HEARING WILL ALLOW US TO GAIN MORE UNDERSTANDING AND AWARENESS THE VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT HIGHER EDUCATION IS FACING AND YET HERE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE MAKING A CHALLENGING TIME LESS INTENSE.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA I THINK YOU LAID OUT THAT THE OVERALL ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON TODAY AND CERTAINLY WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME IN OUR IN OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE TALK ABOUT THIS UCCS YOU'RE HIRED BUDGET COMMITTEE COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID. BECAUSE WE SHUT DOWN RIGHT WING- WE'RE ABOUT TO START SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF OVERSIGHT FOR THE BUDGET- WE DO KNOW THAT OF COURSE ALL OF THE CALLS SYSTEMS HAD ESSENTIALLY GO. ONLINE NINETY NINE PERCENT- 95% I HAVE HERE. BUT THERE ARE SOME OVER ARCHING ISSUES I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY- SPECIFICALLY ENROLLMENT. I KNOW THAT YOU SEE AND SEE ISSUE- MAINLY A STATE FLAT BUT WE ARE CONCERNED WHAT HAPPENED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS. AND THEN FOR THE MAJOR DROP. IN ENROLLMENTS IN THESE ARE OF COURSE OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO WERE TRYING TO GET TO EITHER TRANSFER. OR ENTER THE WORKFORCE REALLY WANNA. EXPLORE THAT WE ALSO WANT TO EXPLORE- BASIC NEEDS ISSUES HOW THIS PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED OUR STUDENTS WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD. HOUSING AND- ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD BEFORE BUT I'M CERTAINLY OUR HEIGHT NOW. AND OVER OF COURSE THE CAMPUS BUDGETS FOR ALL THE SYSTEMS SO WITH THAT I WANT TO START WITH THE- THE FIRST PANEL. WE'RE GONNA DO TO MAKE SURE IT'S EASIER FOR THE MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE WITNESSES. OUR FIRST SEGMENT WE HAVE- THE SENSUALLY THE SEGMENTS UCCS YOU COMMUNICATE ALL AGES AND INDEPENDENT COLLEGES. WE'RE GOING TO BREAK IT UP INTO THREE GOING TO HAVE FIRST THE UC AND CSU. I PROVIDE- THEIR PRESENTATION A LOT LOT LESS TO ENGAGE WITH THEM. AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE AN INDEPENDENT COLLEGES- SO THAT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH. NATIVE RESTAURANT FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND RAINSTORM. FROM THE CSU SYSTEM. LET'S BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF COPING NINETEEN ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I AM A NATIVE ROSE FROM THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE UNIVERSITY. OKAY NINETEEN HAS CREATED UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR THE UNIVERSITY THAT WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. YOU SEE A STEPPED UP TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES BY WORKING TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO CALIFORNIANS IN NEED. I RESEARCHING FOR TREATMENTS AND A VACCINE AND BY TRANSITIONING TO REMOTE LEARNING. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS IN INCREDIBLE FLEXIBILITY SHOWN BY OUR CAMPUSES. PARTICULARLY BY OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF TO QUICKLY TRANSITION THIS PAST SPRING. FOR RESIDENTIAL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO REMOTE LEARNING. ALL WE HAVE MAINTAINED THE FOCUS ON HOW TO BEST DELIVER COURSES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. IN SPITE OF PANDEMIC RELATED. AWARE OKAY. SORRY BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO PUT UP TO WEAR THE MASK. YOU KNOW GOOD. ARE WE MAINTAIN THE FOCUS ON HOW TO BEST DELIVER COURSES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION IN SPITE OF PANDEMIC RELATED CONSTRAINTS THAT HELP KEEP ALL OF US SAFE. CAMPUSES RAMPED UP EFFORTS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY AND ACADEMIC AND COUNSELING SUPPORT. HELPS THE STUDENTS SUCCEED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. EVEN HIGHLY FOCUSED ON STUDENT BASIC NEEDS TO WORK QUICKLY TO DISTRIBUTE A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN KERR'S ACT FUNDING DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE. WE ALSO AUGMENTED THESE BONDS WITH PHILANTHROPIC COMMITMENTS FROM EACH OF THE CAMPUSES. OVER THESE PAST SEVEN MONTHS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WALKING TO USING CORPORATE GUIDANCE FROM OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. THIS SUMMER HE WORKED DILIGENTLY TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF INSTRUCTION. AND CAMPUSES DEVELOP DETAILED AND THOUGHTFUL FALL PLANS INCLUDING ROBUST TESTING PROTOCOLS THAT ENABLE US TO BRING BACK ON THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS BACK TO OUR CAMPUSES. AFTER TESTING TENS OF THOUSANDS BOTH SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC STUDENTS. UC CAMPUSES HAVE GENERALLY SEEN POSITIVITY RATES IN THE RANGE OF ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT. TO ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT. A FRACTION OF THE STATE'S FOURTEEN DAY AVERAGE OF THREE POINT 4% THIS IS A TESTAMENT TO THE COMMITMENT AND HARD WORK OF YOU SEE FACULTY STUDENTS AND STAFF. DESPITE OVER NINETEEN HAS HAD SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE UNIVERSITY. FROM MID MARCH THROUGH OCTOBER WE ESTIMATED TOTAL FISCAL IMPACT OF NEARLY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. OF THIS AMOUNT LOST REVENUE REPRESENTS TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AN EXTRAORDINARY COSTS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC ARE ESTIMATED AT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. REVENUE LOSSES HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY FELT BY OUR MEDICAL CENTERS IN IN OUR AUXILIARY OPERATIONS SUCH AS HOUSING AND DINING. ADDITIONAL EXPENSES INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY PP ADDITIONAL CLEANING TESTING AND TRACING INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH WILL LIKELY GROW AS CAMPUSES SPEND MILLIONS ON TESTING EVERY MONTH TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A RELATIVELY QUICK RECOVERY IN OUR MEDICAL CENTERS WITH AVERAGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS NEARLY EQUALING PRE COVERED RATES. HOWEVER WE REMAIN CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS RECOVERY AS WE WATCH CASES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA SPIKE TO RECORD HIGHS. OUR MEDICAL CENTERS ARE TAKING EXTRA STEPS TO ENSURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY IF WE EXPERIENCE A SIMILAR SURGE THIS WINTER. DURING THIS TIME WE WERE ABLE TO GROW OUR TELEMEDICINE PLATFORM IN CANAL PROVIDE EXPANDED MEDICAL CARE TO PATIENTS IN MORE RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE. STILL WE ARE UNLIKELY TO RECOVER LOST REVENUE DURING REDUCED OPERATIONS AND THIS WILL REDUCE THE MEDICAL CENTER RESERVES. THESE RESERVES COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS SEISMIC RETROFITS. HOUSING A DYING REVENUE ON THE OTHER HAND HAS NOT SEEN THE SAME RECOVERY IS THE MEDICAL CENTERS GIVEN THE REDUCED NUMBER OF STUDENTS LIVING ON CAMPUS. GENERALLY SPEAKING WE ARE LIMITING IT LIMITING OCCUPANCY TO ONE STUDENT PER BEDROOM. WHERE THERE IS A COMMUNAL BATHROOM. AND WITH A SLIGHTLY HIGHER DENSITY IN APARTMENT STYLE UNITS. A HOUSING UNITS VERY BY CAMPUS FROM A LOW OF 10% OCCUPANCY TO HIRE 57% DEPENDING ON THE TYPES OF HOUSING ON THE CAMPUS HOUSING POP PORTFOLIO. AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS. THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING REMAINS VERY STRONG AND WE EXPECT THAT HOW I CAN SEE IN THESE REVENUES WILL QUICKLY REBOUND WHEN IT IS SAFE TO BRING MORE STUDENTS BACK TO CAMPUS. WE ALSO FACE STRUCTURAL FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND ANTICIPATE A LONGER TIME TO RECOVER. THE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED A THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET CUTS FROM THE STATE THIS YEAR. AND THIS PANDEMIC RECESSION IS DIFFERENT- THAN WHAT WE FACED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE STRENGTH OF OUR OTHER REVENUE SOURCES. INCLUDING A MEDICAL CENTERS ARE IDEAL REYES AND OUR RESEARCH ENTERPRISE AS BUDGET CUTS WERE MADE BY THE STATE. WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF PROACTIVE STEPS TO MITIGATE THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND TO MINIMIZE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON JOBS WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL TO THE STATE YOU'RE COVERED. YOU STRATEGIES HAVE INCLUDED SECURING A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR LOW INTEREST TAXABLE BOND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL TO OUR CAMPUSES. HI VISION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY. DEFERRAL OF APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE EMPLOYERS SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE THIS YEAR WHICH WILL ROLL REPAY AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND HIRING FREEZES AND THE WHOLE THING OF SALARY ACTIONS TO CURB EXPENDITURE GROWTH. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDING IMPOSSIBLE BENEFICIAL TAX CHANGES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. AS AN EXAMPLE IF FEDERAL TAX CHANGES OCCURRED ONCE AGAIN ALLOWED US TO DO ADVANCE REFUNDING. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COULD BE FINED UP TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS WHICH WOULD YIELD PRESENT VALUE SAVINGS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE ACADEMIC YEAR COMMENCES FALL ENROLLMENT YOU SEE REMAIN VERY STRONG. MAINTAINING AND INCREASING ENROLLMENT AT UC STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE NATIONAL NUMBERS WERE OVERALL ENROLLMENT IS DOWN ABOUT 4% AND FRESHMAN ROMAN DOWN AS MUCH AS 16% ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. AS OF OCTOBER THIRTIETH. YOU SEE PROJECTED TO BE ABOVE TARGET FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ENROLLMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE LOCAL LAST YEAR'S LEVEL- NONRESIDENT ROMANS BY A RANGE OF 224% AT BOTH THE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE LEVELS WE'VE SEEN MORE CLASS FOR DEFERRALS OR READ MISSION. WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN PANDEMIC IN OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FROM STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. WELL AS MODEST DECLINE IN NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO HAPPEN CAMPUS BUDGET IT IS NOT AS CONCERNING AS A PREDICTIONS OF SOME OF THE MODELS THAT WE PREPARED OVER THE SUMMER. SO CLOSING OUR STRENGTH RESILIENCE WILL CARRY THE UNIVERSITY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH ALL OF YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. TO DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE PLAN FOR CALVARY. OUR CAMPUSES ARE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THOROUGHLY ENGAGED IN SCENARIO PLANNING ON THE RECOVERY. WE EXPECT MANY POSITIVE TRENDS WILL CONTINUE IN POST PANDEMIC I'M FIVE MINUTES. I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL EMERGE AS AN EVEN STRONGER INSTITUTION AS A RESULT OF THE DECISIONS AND ACTIONS TAKEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU WHAT WILL CERTAINLY COME BACK TO YOU NOW I WANNA HEAR FROM RYAN STORM WITH THE CSU. YES HEY I RYAN WE BELIEVE IF YOU JUST START SPEAKING THERE WILL PICK UP YOUR VOICE AND THE CAMEL WILL GO TO YOU SO. PLEASE BEGIN. IT IS A PHYSICAL BUTTON ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DEVICE BEHIND THE- NEWS THERE WE GO I THINK I'VE I THINK I'VE FIGURED IT OUT. ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON THAT YOU'RE BETWEEN ENSURE MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THINK I JUST FIGURED OUT I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME ON THAT END. YES OKAY GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU OKAY TECHNOLOGY IT IS SO MY NAME IS RYAN STORM I'M THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY. I'LL BRIEFLY SHARE WITH YOU THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN ON STUDENTS EMPLOYEES. STUDENT SUCCESS AND UNIVERSITY FINANCES. SO THROUGHOUT THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES CHANCER WHITE HAS GUIDED OUR COBIT NINETEEN RESPONSE BY OUR TWIN NOR STARS SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. AND MAINTAINING OUR STUDENTS PROGRESS 2 DEGREES. SO IN MARCH THE SINCE YOU MADE THE MASSIVE PIVOT TO APPEAR TO VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION. TRANSITIONING SEVENTY THOUSAND CLASSES TOGETHER WITH STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES TO VIRTUAL REALITIES. TODAY LESS THAN 7% IN A PERSON COURSE OFFERINGS FOR FALL TWENTY NINETEEN ARE BEING DELIVERED IN PERSON IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY. WHEN WE MADE THE BIG SHIFT TO VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION IN MARCH WE TOOK GREAT CARE TO MITIGATE THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT TO OUR STUDENTS. HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES WE MAINTAINED ON CAMPUS HOUSING IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WITH NO PLACE NO SAFE PLACE TO GO. WE DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND NEW LAPTOPS AND OFFERED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND WIFI HOT SPOTS TO HELP ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. AND INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE THOUSANDS OF LAPTOPS AND TABLETS ALREADY ON HAND THAT OUR CAMPUS IS MADE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS. WE CONTINUE TO MEET OUR STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS WITH NO CONTACT FOOD DISTRIBUTION. AND EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURE. CAMPUS COUNSELING SERVICES WERE ARE OFFERED VIRTUALLY SERVING STUDENTS THROUGH INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP SESSIONS AS WELL AS OFFERING- PROGRAMMING CENTERED AROUND COPING WITH UNCERTAINTY AND ANXIETY. BY SHIFTING TO A VIRTUAL MODALITY EARLY AT ALL ALLOWED US MORE TIME TO PREPARE FOR PRIMARILY VIRTUAL FALL. FACULTY WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO ENHANCE TEACHING AND LEARNING. ACROSS OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FACULTY MEMBERS OR MORE THAN 60% OF OUR TEACHING FORCE CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HOURS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING OVER THE SUMMER. WHAT WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE EFFORTS OF THOSE COMMITTED TO ENSURING OUR STUDENTS PROGRESS TO DEGREE. WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PANDEMIC'S ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE IMPACT THIS HAS HAD ON OUR VALUED EMPLOYEES. SO IN AN EFFORT TO EASE THE IMPACT THE CSU IMPLEMENTED MULTIPLE APPROACHES. USE OF RESERVES FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. INSTALLING NUMEROUS COST CUTTING MEASURES AND DEVELOPING OTHER CREATIVE WAYS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF COBIT AND AVOID LAYOFFS. THESE EFFORTS HAVE FOR THE TIME BEING UNMITIGATED ANY SYSTEM WIDE LAYOFFS OR FOR LOW PROGRAMS. HOWEVER AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL DUE TO THEIR UNIQUE CHALLENGES THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NOTICES OF LAYOFF. AN ACTUAL LAYOFFS. UNFORTUNATELY A CSU CAMPUSES HAVE HAD TO REDUCE BOTH MANAGEMENT POSITIONS APPROXIMATE A HUNDRED OF THOSE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF A PANDEMIC. AND ALSO REPRESENTED POSITIONS THAT WORK IN OUR NON CORE PROGRAM AREAS. THE NON CORE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC WITH THE MAJORITY THE LAYOFF PLAN NOTICES BEING THE RESULT OF A LACK OF WORK. NOW THE NON CORE PROGRAM. PHYSICIANS ARE SUPPORTED BY REVENUES SUCH AS- A SUGGESTED HOUSING FEES BILL PLANS PARKING AND RETAIL SALES. THESE OPERATIONS OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC DUE TO THE LACK OF STUDENTS ON CAMPUS. PROXIMATE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR LAYOFF NOTICES WERE INITIALLY SENT TO EMPLOYEES OF APPROX UP OUT OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THREE THOUSAND SETIA PLOYS. AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LABOR REPRESENTATIVES WE HAVE RESCINDED NINETY OF THOSE NOTICES. NO ONE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE PERMITTED THIS ISSUE HAS REASSIGNED CURRENT EMPLOYEES TO OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS US REDUCING THE NUMBER OF NOTICES. AS AN EXAMPLE CINEMA STATE THEY ISSUED NOTICES TO- FOOD SERVICE WORKERS AFTER CLOSING THEIR FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS. BUT WE'RE ABLE TO REASSIGN THIRTEEN EMPLOYEES TO OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS AND ANOTHER NINE EMPLOYEES WERE PROVIDED PART TIME WORK AS NEW WORK BECAME AVAILABLE. CURRENTLY THE CSU IS IN THE MEET AND CONFER PERIOD AS OUTLINED IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AT EIGHT CAMPUSES TO BE CLEAR NO REPRESENTED LAYOFFS. HAVE BEEN FINALIZED. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO MITIGATE THE LAYOFFS THIS ISSUE HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED MULTIPLE PAID LEAVE PROGRAMS TO KEEP EMPLOYEES IN THEIR POSITIONS. THESE PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON EMPLOYEES AGES SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER. OR PLOYS WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. ALSO PROVIDED COVERAGE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT WERE UNABLE TO WORK REMOTELY. OR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME TO DEAL WITH COVIDIEN PACKS SUCH AS CHILD CARE ILLNESS OR THE CARE OF A FAMILY MEMBER. WE'RE STILL TABULATING THE DATA BUT A PRELIMINARY FIGURES INDICATE THAT MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES UTILIZE A COMBINATION OR ALL OF THE PAID LEAVE PROGRAM TO SEE IF YOU OFFERED. ON AVERAGE PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES TOOK AN ESTIMATED. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HOURS OF LEAVE BETWEEN THE PERIODS OF MARCH EIGHTEENTH AND JUNE THIRTIETH. ALSO ON THE LEAVE PROGRAMS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYEES LIKE OURS- THAT HAVE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL FAMILIES FIRST CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE. I HAD TO PROVIDE THE FEDS PROVIDED TO TWO THIRDS OF EMPLOYEES PAY BUT THE A CHANCE ARE MADE THE DECISION TO INSTEAD PROVIDE ENROLLMENT IN THOSE LEVELS SO DESPITE THE UNPRECEDENTED EVENTS OF TWENTY TWENTY OUR STUDENTS HAVE PERSISTED AT REMARKABLE RATES OR MANY INSTITUTIONS NATIONWIDE HAVE REPORTED A DECLINE IN UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT THE CSU HASN'T ROLLED ITS LARGEST EVER STUDENT BODY. THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES COLLECTIVELY ENROLLED THE HIGHEST NUMBEROF STUDENTS IN OUR HISTORY NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WHICH IS A THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SPEEDS GREATER THAN FALL TWENTY NINETEEN. ADDITIONALLY THE SINCE YOU GRADUATED A RECORD NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN SPRING TWENTY TWENTY. BY CONFERRING DEGREES. INCLUDING. ONE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY BACCALAUREATE DEGREES. IN MAY ONLY TWO MONTHS AFTER PIVOTING TO A VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION IN MARCH THE CSU ANNOUNCED THAT FALL COURSES WOULD ALSO BE VIRTUAL. WE BELIEVE MAKING THAT DECISION EARLY ALLOWED STUDENTS AND FAMILIES- TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY. IT PROVIDES CERTAINTY AT A TIME OF TREMENDOUS UNCERTAINTY. NOW ANOTHER BRIGHT SPOT OF THE C. ISSUE IS THE CONTINUED SUCCESS SUCCESS OF GRADUATION TO SHIP TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WHICH CONTINUES TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES AND NARROW EQUITY GAPS EFFORT TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE NEEDS. L. LAST MONTH DOCTOR LORD BLANCHARD GAVE A PRESENTATION HIGHLIGHTING THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS MADE AS A RESULT OF. THE SUPPORT AND INVESTMENT BY THE STATE. HIS PRESENTATION CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AND A FULL REPORT WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY. IN THE MEANTIME I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY POINTS AND DOCTOR BLANCHARD'S PRESENTATION. SO FIRST STARTING WITH FIRST TIME STUDENTS. BEFORE GRADUATION RATE FOR FIRST TIME STUDENTS INCREASED BY THIRTY INCREASED 231% COMPARED 219% THE LAUNCH INITIATIVE FIVE YEARS AGO. THE SIX OUR GRADUATION RATE FOR THOSE FIRST TIME STUDENTS REMAINS AT 62% IN ON AVERAGE FIRST TIME STUDENTS ARE TAKING MORE UNITS PER TERM ALMOST FIFTEEN UNITS PER TERM. THAT'S THE MOST THAT WE'VE EVER HAD. IN OUR- EXPERIENCE. ANOTHER NOTABLE MILESTONE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO COPE IN NINETEEN. SIXTY RECORDED A RECORD RETENTION RATE EIGHTY FIVE POINT 5% OF FIRST YEAR STUDENTS RETURN TO CAMPUS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY. ALSO SEEING PROGRESS WITH TRANSFER STUDENTS. WHICH HERE GRADUATION RATE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS HAS INCREASED 2404% JUST SHY OF OUR TWENTY FIVE. THE FOR YOUR GRAD RATE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS HAS INCREASED 279% AS CHANCER WHITE HAS SAID QUOTE A LOT OF CREDIT GOES TO THE STUDENTS FOR THEIR PERSISTENCE AND FLEXIBILITY TRANSITION TO VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION. IN SUPPORT ARE MADE NECESSARY BY THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK AND DEDICATION OF OUR FACULTY AND STAFF WHO OVERCAME UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES TO ADVANCE THE. TO OUR FINANCES NOT SO GOOD OF A ROSY STORY HERE. SO WE SERVING CAMPUSES DURING THE SPRING TERM. AND AGAIN FOR THIS FALTER. AND ASK FOR THEIR ESTIMATES OF CODED RELATED REVENUE LOSSES AND COSTS FOR ALL FUND SOURCES. ALL TOGETHER IT IS JUST OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT AND THAT FIGURE INCLUDES THE RESULTING WHAT TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILLION. DOLLAR ONGOING STATE APPROPRIATION REDUCTION IN THIS CURRENT YEAR. CAMPUSES IN THE SYSTEM OFFICE CONTINUE TO SEEK WAYS TO DAMP TO DAMPEN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS UP AT THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. WE HAVE INITIATED A HIRING CHILL THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. WE STOPPED ALL TRAVEL AND HAVE CUT OPERATIONAL COSTS WHEREVER WE CAN. WHILE WE HAVE FAILED SAVINGS IN AREAS SUCH AS UTILITIES OTHER COSTS OF HAVE NECESSARILY INCREASED SUCH AS A PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT SANITATION FACILITY MODIFICATIONS FOR PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND OF COURSE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT SOFTWARE AND RELATED SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES REPORT THEY PLAN TO DRAW ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY POINT FOUR MILLION FROM PARK UNCOMMITTED RESERVES. JUST IN THE COURT EDUCATIONAL AND SUPPORT PASSED IN SUPPORT AREA ALONE. THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT WE HAVE TODAY. FOR NON CORE ENTERPRISES LIKE STUDENT HOUSING AND PARKING THESE AREAS ARE SUFFERING REVENUE LOSSES. IN OUR DRAWING ON SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF THEIR THOSE RESERVES AS WELL. SO BEING ABLE TO COVER DEBT SERVICE ON MORE RECENTLY CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERN OF THE UNIVERSITY. NOW ALL- CREDIBLE FINANCIAL FORECASTS INDICATE THAT THIS PANDEMIC COULD CREATE THREE YEAR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES TO THE STATE AND TO THE C. ISSUE. THEREFORE IF OUR FINANCES pMONTHS OR YEARS BEYOND WHAT WE KNOW TODAY. YOU NEED TO BE AWARE THAT WE WILL HAVE TO EXPLORE MORE DISCOURAGING OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US THAT COULD BE FURLOUGHS MORE LAYOFF NOTICES. THAT COULD BE LIMITING STUDENT ROMAN AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A SLOW DOWN IN TIME TO DO CREEK 2 DEGREES FOR OUR STUDENTS. WE HAVE SOME IDEAS WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU. ON HOW WE COMMUNICATE THE NEED OF ANY OF THOSE DIFFICULT CHOICES. SO CLOSING THIS ISSUE IS PERSISTING THROUGH THE DIFFICULT UNUSUAL TIME TO REMAIN TRUE TO OUR CORE MISSION AND DELIVER A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION TO OUR STUDENTS. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING THAT PACKS OF COKE IN NINETEEN. ALEX HAD WHAT IT'S HAD ON US CSU STUDENTS ARE EMPLOYEES ARE STILL SUCCESS AT THE UNIVERSITY'S FINANCES. THANK YOU AYE MR STORM AGAIN WE HEARD JUST NOW FROM UC AND CSU WE'RE GONNA WAIT A LITTLE BIT FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN INDEPENDENT COLLEGES ALLOW MEMBERS TO. ENGAGE ASK QUESTIONS COMMENTS OFF I'LL HAVE A FEW BUT I THE FIRST TORNADO OVER TO ANY COMMITTEES. LIKE TO JUMP INTO MISTER O'DONNELL YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE A PRESENTATIONS TODAY. BOB BUT QUESTIONS ARE YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON PAGES ONE AND TWO OF THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND. SHOWING COSTS LOSSES BECAUSE OF CODE NINETEEN DO THOSE NUMBERS ACCOUNT FOR FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS FOR THE FOR THE THREE MINUTES FUNDS THAT ARE. HANDED DOWN. TO THE SYSTEM. EITHER ONE COULD RESPONSIBLE. YEAH COMMITTEE PACKAGE BUT THE THIS IS NATHAN BROSTROM AND WE DID RECEIVE- ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN KERR'S ACT FUNNY THAT WENT TO OUR MEDICAL CENTERS AND CAMPUSES THAT IS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION SO THAT THAT IS A- A BENEFIT TO- I TO THE CAMPUSES MEDICAL CENTERS. THANK YOU IN THIS ISSUE. MAYBE WILL I HAVE THE UC STILL BEFORE US MISTER TRACKER JUST. ASK ONE MORE QUESTION A UNDER HIM. DO YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY MOVE AROUND FUNDS DO DO DO YOU FIND THAT WHAT THE STATE IS HANDED DOWN TO YOU IS IN THE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH FASHION WHERE YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND TO. TO WHERE YOU SEE IT. THE NEED IS. YEAH TO SOME EXTENT WE CAN- THERE IS SOME FUNGIBILITY B. IN THE- IN STATE FUNDING AND MEDICAL CENTERS. TO SHARE FUNDS WITH THEIR OWN CAMPUSES- WE HAVE- PROBABLY THE AREA THAT WE'RE MOST LIMITED IN IS THE- IS CONTRACTS AND GRANTS THOSE ARE VERY LIMITED ON WHAT WE CAN SPEND THE DIRECTOR. OF FUNDING ON. AND THEN ALSO- ARE WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT MEANS FOR OUR OUR BONDS. WE HAVE A GENERAL AN EDUCATIONAL LEAN WE HAVE THE- MEDICAL CENTER LEAN. AND THE- LIMITED PROJECT REVENUE BONDS WHICH ARE FOR HOUSING AND DINING. THOSE ARE ONLY WE CAN ONLY SPEND CERTAIN REVENUES TO WANT TO PAY THAT DEBT SERVICE SO THAT'S- THOSE ARE CONSTRAINED BUT OTHERWISE WE HAVE SOME FUNGIBILITY AND HOW WE MOVE FIVE. I FUNDS AROUND THAT WITHIN THE CAMPUS. SO IF THERE IS IF THERE IS A BOND FOR HOUSING LET'S SAY THERE'S OF ON HOUSING. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN'T AT THIS POINT. JONATHAN RESERVES TO CARRY THOSE FOR SOME TIME GOING FORWARD. ALL RIGHT WE DO WE HAVE- OUR HOUSING IS ABOUT 38% CAPACITY RIGHT NOW ACROSS ALL BUT IT RANGES FROM A LOW OF TEN PERCENT. AND SANTA CRUZ IN MERCED TO OVER 50% AT AT SAN DIEGO THE LEAN IS A SYSTEMATIC MEANS WE ARE ABLE TO USE REVENUES ACROSS THE SYSTEM TO COVER THAT IN ADDITION EACH. OUR HOUSING SYSTEM HAS RESERVE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DRAW ON TO PAY THE DEBT SERVICE. THANK YOU AND HAVE YOU ADDED AS AS OF YET HAVE THERE BEEN ANY LAYOFFS OR FURLOUGHS. ALL RIGHT. THERE HAVE BEEN- MOST OF THOSE HAVE BEEN TEMPORARY- TO DATE THERE HAVE BEEN- ONE THOUSAND A HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN ACROSS THE SYSTEM. BUT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY OF THOSE HAVE BEEN TEMPORARY LAYOFFS- WITH ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY- A PERMANENT WHITE HOUSE. AND PRESIDENT DRAKE IS WORKING ON SOME ACTIONS WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO. PRESERVE JOBS AND GOD REALLY MINIMIZED- ESPECIALLY PERMANENT LAYOFFS. AND SO WE'RE REALLY TAKING SOME ACTIONS TO THE REGENTS- I NEXT WEEK FOR CONSIDERATION THERE. THANK YOU. OKAY. REMEMBERS MR MEDINA. MY QUESTION IS TO YOU SEE AND I HAVE TO I UNDERSTAND THAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS UC STUDENTS REPORTER SIR. ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IN ORDER TO TAKE THE REMOTE REMOTE COURSES I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OVER 80% ARE NOT HAVING ACCESS TO A PRIVATE SPACE. OR SUFFICIENT MATERIAL TO TAKE THEIR COURSES. WHAT MEASURES AT UC CAMPUSES TAKING PROVIDE STUDENTS. ACCESS TO BROADBAND. INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. AND WHILE YOU MAY NOT HAVE A LIST. IN FRONT OF YOU IF YOU WOULD PLEASE FOLLOW UP WITH MY STAFF AND. REPORTER. FIVE CAN YOU START OVER OKAY YEAH I'LL BEGIN AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF U. UC STUDENTS HAVE REPORTED BEING CONCERNED ABOUT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IN ORDER TO TAKE THE REMARK REMOTE COURSES ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OVER 80% REPORT NOT HAVING TAXES TO PRIVATE STUDY SPACE OR SUFFICIENT MATERIAL TO TAKE THEIR COURSES WHAT MEASURES HAVE UC CAMPUSES TAKEN TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO BROADBAND AND INTERNET. CONNECTIVITY. YEAH THE- THAT THIS WAS A BIG- OUR CONCERN FOR ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES AND WHEN WE DO WE DO IT ANNUAL SURVEY OF IT UNDERGRADUATES. AND THEY FOUND JUST AS YOU REPORTED THAT MR MEDINA- 80% DID NOT HAVE AN APPROPRIATE STUDY SPACE- THAT GREW EVEN HIGHER WHEN YOU LOOK AT FIRST GENERATION OR PELL GRANT STUDENTS. AND MANY OF THEM DID NOT FEEL LIKE THEY HAD ACCESSTO- TO RELIABLE BROADBAND TO PARTICIPATE- SO WE DID SEVERAL THINGS FIRST LIKE I'D LIKE TO SEE IS YOU. WE DISTRIBUTED ON BOTH LAPTOPS AND HOT SPOTS- TO STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO NEEDED THEM- I SPENT LAST SPRING AT UC MERCED. AND WE WERE VERY- GRATEFUL AND HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH HEWLETT PACKARD WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO. DONATE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR QUITMAN JAZZ TO OUR OUR UC MERCED STUDENTS I KNOW EACH OF THE- EACH OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES HAD SIMILAR EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS HAD ADEQUATE- A LOT OF FUN. WE ALSO OPEN OUR CAMPUSES- MORE THAN- WE LET STUDENTS STAY IF THEY FELT THAT THEY IT WAS IN A MORE APPROPRIATE- A PLACE FOR THEM TO STUDY. ALSO FELT SAFER THAN THAN AT HOME SO- AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS ON CAMPUS ALL RIGHT NOW AGAIN. YOU KNOW THAT'S OUR CAPACITY IS WELL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND- BUT- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING A- SAFE POSITIVITY RATES- BUT WE WILL GET YOU THE- ALL THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE- OF TECHNOLOGY ARE WE DID HAVE A SPECIAL. SEGMENT OF THE CURES ACT FUNDING THAT WENT OUT SPECIFICALLY FOR TECHNOLOGY RELATED DATA DEFICIENCIES- AND WE CAN NOT WILL HIGHLIGHT THAT- AND MATERIAL FOR YOUR FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND NEEDS AND IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT BY CAMPUS. FORCE THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. ABSOLUTELY THIS QUESTION TO YOU AGAIN. UC RIVERSIDE THAT I. IN RIVERSIDE AS WELL AS UC IRVINE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO ME A SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- THAT THEY'RE GETTING CAUGHT IN LEASES IN LEASES WITH OFF CAMPUS HOUSING. NOT UC HOUSING BUT OFF CAMPUS HOUSING- PRIVATE LEASES BUT ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC BUT AGAIN NOW WITH CLASSES BEGINNING IN THE FALL STUDENTS I KNOW AT UC RIVERSIDE. AND IRVINE ARE GETTING STUCK WITH THESE LEASES ARE THAT THEY CAN'T GET OUT RIGHT DID LANDLORDS ARE SAYING WE WILL ONLY LET YOU OUT OF THE LEASE IF YOU FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE YOUR PLACE- AND SO THEY'RE GETTING CAUGHT WITH THE- NO BAD CREDIT IF THEY JUST MOVE AWAY. AND CERTAINLY AGAIN MORE FINANCIAL STRAIN IS UC ARE UC CAMPUSES DOING ANYTHING TO TRY TO AT LEAST. NOTIFY THE STUDENTS OR WHAT IS YOU SEE DOING SO THAT THAT DOESN'T CONTINUE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S QUITE AN ISSUE BOTH IN RIVERSIDE AND IRVINE. YEAH AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEAN I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON WHAT EACH CAMPUS IS DOING I KNOW WHEN I WAS AT- OR SAID IN THE SPRING. THAT WAS AN ISSUE IN A LOT OF THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW CAME TO US AND WANTED TO KNOW SHOULD THEY BE SIGNING THESE LEASES AND SO WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME ON CAMPUS RESOURCES. TO HELP THEM ESPECIALLY THEN BECAUSE ASIANS WITH- WITH LANDLORDS BUT- I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON WHAT EACH INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES DOING TO SUPPORT STUDENTS- I DO KNOW YOU KNOW IRVINE HAS QUITE A BIT OF. P. THREE HOUSING AND I KNOW THAT IRVINE STEPPED IN TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS- ON BEHALF OF- OF SOME OF THE STUDENTS TO- TO MITIGATE. THAT ANY. FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THEM. THANK YOU. OKAY I'LL HAVE A FEW THAT QUESTIONS YOU BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON THIS I THINK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS TO US I'LL START WITH YOU SEE. YOU SEE RIGHT HERE NATHAN WITH US AS FAR AS ENROLLMENT. I WANTED TO I'VE I'VE TALKED TO A FEW OF YOUR CAMPUS LEADERS IN LAST FEW MONTHS ABOUT. ENROLLMENT TRENDS OF SPECIFICALLY. WHAT HAPPENED WITH NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT AND WE REALIZE THAT SAID. FOR WRONG YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S A KEY PART OF THE THREE LEG GET FINANCIAL BASICALLY PATH FOR THE UNIVERSITY DOES STUDENT FEE REVENUE FROM CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS YEAH GENERAL FUND FROM THE STATE. AND NONRESIDENT THE EXTRA NONRESIDENT TUITION YOU GET ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS FOR ALL THE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS- WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THAT WITH THE TREND AS FAR AS NON RESIDENTS DURING THIS COVERED PANDEMIC. OUR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS ARE THE ONLY ONE- CHAIRMAN PARTY WHICH HAS SEEN A- DIP AT ALL AND IT HAS RANGED FROM- 2% DECLINE TO A 4% DECLINE ACROSS THE CAMPUSES. ARE INTERESTINGLY- INCOMING STUDENTS HAS BEEN IT HAS STAYED STRONG BUT IT'S A LOT OF RETURNING STUDENTS WHO DECIDED THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO IT REMOTELY. AND DID NOT RETURN TO CAMPUS THE FIRST PLACE WE SAW THIS WAS. AT BERKELEY WHICH IS YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR- OUR SEMESTER CAMPUSES SO THEY STARTED EARLIER THAN THE QUARTER CAMPUSES. THEY SAW DECLINE ARE BOTH IN RETURNING- NONRESIDENT STUDENTS PARTICULARLY INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND ALSO IN SOME OF THE ONE YEAR. MASTER'S PROGRAMS THAT WERE. VERY POPULAR WITH- SOME OF THEIR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. ARE THE- OTHER CAMPUSES THAT HAVE NOT SEEN AS BIG AS A CLIENT THE ONLY OTHER ONE THAT HAS A SIMILAR DECLINE IS UC IRVINE. BUT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A VERY BIG CLASS FOUR YEARS EARLIER AND SO THEY WERE DEIBERATELY ARE REDUCING THEIR- THAT THE NUMBER OF- OF STUDENTS- BUT AGAIN IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW. MUCH LESS THAN WE HAD PROJECTED- IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT 224% DECLINE- ED ANYONE ANYONE GIVING CAMPUS. ALL RIGHT SO AT AND WE KNOW WE HAVE A NON RESIDENT. POLICY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT. WE WORKED ON A YEARS AGO WITH YOU IT MYSELF TANG THINK THAT'S A FAIR. COMPROMISE CAME UP WITH IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A CAP UT IT'S R. RATIO SO. ESSENTIALLY EVERY- YOU KNOW NON RESIDENT STUDENT YOU ENROLL WE WANT TO THE ROLE ROUGHLY YOU KNOW THREE. THREE OR FOUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS DEPENDING ON YOUR CAMPUS- SO IS IT IS THAT YOU KNOW. APPLES TO ORANGES WORKS APPLES TO APPLES WHEN WE CAN LOOK AT. POTENTIALLY FEWER NON RESIDENTS DOES THAT AT ALL. EXPAND SPACE OR CAPACITY FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN. THAT IS ALWAYS THE ISSUE THAT WE HERE WE GO HOME TO OUR DISTRICTS AS WE HAVE A NEIGHBOR OR FRIEND OR SO AND SO'S GOT UP. FOUR POINT SOMETHING GPA AND CAN'T GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY SEE THE RATIO. AS WE SAW NEARLY IN TWO THOUSAND- TWO THOUSAND INCREASING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND YOU KNOW ROUGHLY ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED I'M REALLY DECLINE IN IN NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. BUT IS IT AS YOU POINT OUT THIS IS GOING CAMPUS BY CAMPUS AND SO ON I WILL BLOW THE OVERALL HE PERCENT CASH THAT SHOULD FALL MORE IN EACH OF THE CAMPUSES ARE ABOVE THAT WILL SEE THEIR RATIO. ON AND THEN IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING THAT THE- FOR YOU SEE CONTINUE IT REMAINS TO EVEN WITH. YOU SUCH A- IN IN THE MAIL. AND ACTUAL PRESIDENT ROLAND ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE FACT THAT WE. EIGHTY HUNDRED STUDENTS WAS. GEN YEAH AND LASTLY DO YOU THINK THE NON STUDENTS WHO ARE ARE IN THE UC IT JUST TOOK A TOOK A COVERED BREAK. JUVENTUS A PATE THAT THEY WOULD COME BACK ON OR THEY TRY TO GET THAT DEGREE ELSEWHERE PROBABLY MAKES SENSE THAT IT WOULD FINISHED OR SO CLOSE IT'S HARD TO FINISH UP SOMEWHERE ELSE SO YEAH. HOW DO WE SEE THAT PLAYING OUT. WELL MANY OF THEM WILL COME BACK BUT THEY JUST WANTED TO HAVE A MEETING PERSON RESIDENTIAL. AND ALSO YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THEIR INTERNATIONAL- ATTAINING. HE WAS ON THAT MAYBE YOU KNOW MAYBE. IT IS JUST NOT. I'M NOT ABLE FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND SO I THINK THEY IN ANY WAITING A SEMESTER OR WE NEED A FULL YEAR. BEFORE THEY RETURN TO. MRS YEAH. THANK YOU THAT MAKES SENSE- COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR RAINSTORM IN CS YOU CAN GET RYAN RYAN BACK AT. YOU KNOW I WAS PLEASED BY WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW MORE STUDENTS ARE TAKING- THE FIFTEEN UNIT GOAL. TO BE GOING TO BE GOING FULL TIME AND- WELL I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR A LITTLE BIT FROM OUR PRESIDENT HERE AT THAT SAC STATE. AND EVEN THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASING YEAR AFTER YEAR AND EVEN AND DURING CO THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT- INCREASES WELL SO- CAN YOU TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. MR STORM. YEAH I THINK I GENERALLY SPEAKING- THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT ARE DRIVEN- OUR SUCCESS IN THAT WHITE ONE IT'S JUST GETTING THE WORD OUT WORD OUT THAT. YOU NEED TO TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS IN ORDER TO GRADUATE IN A TIMELY FASHION AND- AS MORE AND MORE COHORTS OF NEW STUDENTS HAVE ENTERED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OR THE GRADUATION OF IT I MEAN WE'VE ESSENTIALLY HAVE A WHOLE. ALL OF OUR COHORTS OF STUDENTS ARE NOW STUDENTS WHO HAVE HEARD THAT MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND SO I THINK YOU JUST SEE THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENING YEAH THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MESSAGING POINTED AT THE OTHER POINT OF IT TOO IS OF COURSE THE FUNDING OF THE GRADUATION OF ITSELF. IT HAD BEEN ADDED HATS THREE SOLID YEARS OF REALLY SOLID FUNDING FOR THAT FOR THE GRADUATION OF. WHAT THAT ALLOWED FOR IS THE CAMPUS IS TO MATCH THAT DEMAND FROM STUDENTS AT ALLOWED CAMPUSES TO OFFER THOSE ADDITIONAL COURSES SO THAT. STUDENTS COULD TAKE THOSE UP TO FIFTEEN UNITS. WORTH OF COURSE IS NOT A GRADUATE AS AS THEY SEE FIT COURSE THAT I GRABBED IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAID THAT YOU MUST TAKE IT AWFUL LOAD. UP OF COURSE EVERY STUDENT HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CAN GO AT A SLOWER PACE OF THE CHU SO BUT- THE GOAL OF THE GRADUATION OF WAS TO OFFER THAT IS AS TO THE EXTENT WE COULD POSSIBLE TO OVER STUDENTS. I THINK- I. THINK WE'RE SHOWING A LOT OF GREAT SUCCESS SO FAR. YEAH WELL I OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT IS A VERY- IMPORTANT NEWS AND IT. IT IS A TWO FOLD HELP THAT HELPS THE STUDENTS GRADUATE. WITHIN FOUR YEARS WITHOUT AS MUCH DEBT- WE KNOW THAT'S THE STUDENTS GO ON FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS THEY- RUN OUT OF. CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY THEY HAVE TO BORROW MONEY. JUST SOMETHING OUT SAID THIS IS CYCLE. AND THEN FURTHER. YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR AS YOU TELL US WE HAVE. THIRTY THOUSAND SOMETHING. QUALIFIED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO WANT TO GO TO THE CSU WOULD. WHO CAN'T GET IN. SO THE MORE STUDENTS YOU KNOW FINISH IN FOUR YEARS THAT'S MORE SPACE FOR. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WHO WANT TO GET THE IN THE CSU SYSTEM- SO. APPRECIATE THAT ONE THING THAT I KNOW I TALK TO YOU ABOUT. DR RAMBLE AND I HAVE A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE PUSHED LEGISLATION. WOULD THEN. CSU PRESIDENT OF CASTRO. AND NOW OF COURSE HE'S THE LEADER OF THE CSU SYSTEM. TO TRY TO. CHANGE OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. TO REALLY- NEAR THE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE THIS FULL TIME. AND WITH WITH THE FINANCIAL AID SO NOT NECESSARILY FIFTEEN. PER SEMESTER BUT THIRTY PER YEAR SO. STUDENTS STILL WANT TAKE TWELVE FOR SEMESTER THEY CAN. DO SOMETHING IN WINTER SESSION OR SUMMER SCHOOL- WE THINK THAT ALL OF THE NAVAL STUDENTS MOST OF POORLY TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS- YOU KNOW BUT ALSO. ALLOW THEM TO NOT HAVE TO TAKE STUDENT DEBT AT THE END WHEN THEY'RE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY SO. LOOK. FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT THIS YEAR. THANK YOU MR TANG- AND HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY. MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IS QUESTIONS SO. THE. TWO POINT THREE BILLION- LOST THAT THAT DID NOT CLICK THAT DID NOT INCLUDE THE CODE THAT CARES ACT MONEY AS WELL AS THE FOR CSU THE SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT. REVENUE LOSS DID IT INCLUDE THE FIVE TWENTY FIVE FROM CARES. I KNOW IT DID NOT SO WHAT WE DID WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF BOTH OF THESE TERMS THE SPRING- TWENTY TWENTY TERM IN THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY TERM. SERVER AT OUR CAMPUS TO SEE WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE NOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL SHAKE OUT RIGHT. THE USE OF KERR'S ACT FUNDING WILL BE PART OF THAT MEDICATION ALSO YOU'LL SEE THE MITIGATION IN THE WAY OF. OUR HIRING FREEZE OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO-IN AND ALSO THE USE OF OUR OF OUR RESERVES. SO THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF A HIGH WATER MARK IN TERMS OF WHAT WE THINK OUR CAMPUSES HAVE IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE AND OBVIOUSLY THAT NUMBER WILL. LIKELY COME DOWN. OVER TIME BASED ON THESE MEDICATIONS SO IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF YOUR ACTUALS WHERE YOU ARE THE WE- REALLY HAVE A LOT OF. DETAIL ON ACTUALS OF OTHER THAN THE ACTUAL. CAUSES FOR. DETAIL JUST LOOKING FOR WHERE YOU ARE. YEAH YEAH YEAH- WHAT I CAN REPORT TO YOU WHAT WOULD BE THE COST TO DATE SO WE HAVE COSTS COVERED RELATED FOR ALL FUND SOURCES OF ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DATE. FROM THE START OF MARCH THROUGH- I THINK IT'S THROUGH THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER. AS I SAID ONE HUNDRED WORK BUT WAS MY QUESTION SO I JUST I JUST HOUSE WHERE ARE YOU. IN TERMS OF REVENUE MINUS EXPENSES ACTUALS AS OF TODAY. I CAN'T I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AS OF TODAY I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT THE DETAIL OF THAT. THANKS OF TEXAS SURVEY OF CAMPUSES TO DO SO. YOU DON'T YOU DON'T TRACK IT ON A MONTH BASIS. WELL WE DO IT MORE- PERIODICALLY JUST ON A MONTHLY BASIS- SO WE ARE JUST ABOUT TO POP THAT. YOUR QUICK LIKE WHEN LIKE ONCE A YEAR I THINK IT'S ALL THE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THAT BUT THAT'S THAT'S WAITING INTO AN AREA THAT I DON'T HAVE THE BEST UNDERSTANDING OF RIGHT NOW SAFETY PRACTICAL. THAT'S FINE. MISTER BREWSTER JUST SAY WE JUST WANT TO REITERATE FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM BEACH THE QUESTION. YEAH WE DO TRACK IT ON A- A MONTHLY BASIS- BOTH- FOR THE POTENTIAL OF. FUTURE HEROES THAT FUNDING BUT ALSO FOR FEMALE ONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE- I RECOUPED. SO OUR NUMBER ACTUALLY AS OF OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WAS TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AGAIN TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE OR REVENUE. THAT WAS- BELOW OUR PROJECTIONS AND- INCREASED- EXPENSES AND AGAIN THAT'S A ACROSS BOTH OUR CAMPUSES AND OUR MEDICAL CENTERS I GOT. A NOTICE. OF THE OF THE CURES ACT FUNDING. THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT MR LAST SENTENCE THAT WAS WHAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT'S A GROSS WITH FISCAL IMPACT BUT WE DID GET CARES ACT FUNDING OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND- SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS GOT GOT. TO THAT WAS CALCULATED INTO YOUR REVENUE NUMBERS. YEAH OKAY PERFECT IN AN THEY CAN. IN SIX QUESTION FOR BY FOR. BOTH CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A SENSE. YOUR YOUR TESTING PROTOCOLS YOUR CONTACT TRACING PROTOCOLS FOR. FURRY ART BY DO YOU KNOW YOUR STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF THOSE WHO ARE ON CAMPUS. YEAH MAYBE I'LL I'LL START OUR EVERY CAMPUS HAS THE DISKS ARE DIFFERENT- PROTOCOL BUT WE ARE TRYING WE ARE HEARING MANY OF THEM UP FOR EXAMPLE A UCLA- HAS DEVELOPED THE SWAP SEEK WHICH WILL BE A MUCH LOWER COST. OF PROTOCOL AND THEY'RE STARTING TO WORK WITH UC SANTA BARBARA ON IT ARE YOU SEE IS THAT IS LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH UC BERKELEY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW BERKELEY IS USING A- A COMMERCIAL- VENDOR WHICH IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN AND I ADDS TO THEIR COSTS. ARE UC SAN DIEGO HAS PROBABLY BEEN THE MOST RIGOROUS IN TERMS OF THEIR PROTOCOLS BECAUSE EVERYONE ON CAMPUS TWICE A MONTH- AND THEY DO IT ALL- INTERNALLY SO WE ARE HOPING ESPECIALLY MOVING INTO- WINNER AT QUARTER SPRING SEMESTER. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BRING MORE STUDENTS BACK ON CAMPUS BECAUSE OF THE- BOTH THAT THE- THAT THE TESTING THE CONTACT TRACING AND THEN THE QUARANTINE- ABILITY SO- RIGHT NOW WITH POSITIVITY RATES ARE WELL BELOW POINT FIVE PERCENT. WE STILL HAVE PLENTY OF CAPACITY FOR A QUARANTINING OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE- WHO. ARE ARE ARE COULD BE POSITIVE. I THINK THE ABOUT YOUR- TRACING PARTICLE. OUR I GET IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EACH CAMPUS BUT- UC SAN DIEGO IS PROBABLY THE- PROBABLY THE BUT THE MOST ROBUST WITH THAT AND THEY- ARE THEY HAVE BEEN INCORPORATING THAT THE OTHER THING THAT SAN DIEGO IS DONE IS THEY'RE ALSO USING IT FOR OFF CAMPUS STUDENTS WHO ARE COME ON AND THEY FOUNDED THEIR TEST THE POSITIVE THE RATES ARE HIGHER- SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS THREE TIMES HIGHER SO STUDENTS ON ON CAMPUS SO. ONE OF THINGS OR FINDING IS THAT IT'S ALMOST SAFE IS FOR STUDENTS TO BE IN A RESIDENTIAL- I CAMPUS BASED AYE AYE COMMUNITY. GREAT THANK YOU AND THEN- I JUST A FULL OPEN FROM THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER WAS- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LOSSES WERE YOUR DURING YOUR ANCILLARY SPACES LIKE HOUSING AND FOOD SERVICE SO HOW DO YOU I GUESS HOW DO YOU. MANAGE THAT AYE AYE I THINK FOR THE LONG TERM YOU MUST HAVE. SOME SOME AMOUNT OF DEBT SERVICE ON THE HOUSING OR THINGS LIKE THAT SO HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR PLAN ON MANAGING THE- YEAH THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND WE DO HAVE. YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE DEBT SERVICE ON ON- A LOT OF THE HOUSING. THAT'S PROBABLY OUR MOST FIXED EXPENSE- IN ADDITION PRESIDENT DRAKE. HAS BEEN ADAMANT THAT HE REALLY WANTS TO MINIMIZE- PERMANENT LAYOFFS WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOT. A PART OF THE PROBLEM AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO. PRESERVE USING REDEPLOYMENT AND OTHER OTHER MEASURES- TO PRESERVE- EMPLOYMENT- RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW THE RESERVES ARE STANDING UP. FOR A DELIVERIES- BUT WE'RE AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY AS WE MOVE INTO THE WINTER QUARTER AND SPRING SEMESTER. AGAIN AS I SAID- SYSTEM WATER ABOUT 38% CAPACITY. THAT RANGES FROM A LOW OF 10% TO A HIGH OF OVER FIFTY PERCENT- BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE RESERVES- WE WERE VERY- THE- THAT THE TAXABLE BOND ISSUE THAT I MENTIONED LAST SUMMER WE DID ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THE ALL IN RATES WERE ABOUT ONE. POINT FOUR PERCENT. OF FOR SEVEN YEAR TERM SO ARE VERY VERY LOW COST MONEY THAT ALSO GAVE CAMPUSES. ARE SOME QUESTION AND IN TERMS OF PRESERVING EMPLOYMENT. EVEN WITHOUT THE LOSS IN REVENUES. THE THANK YOU WE HAVE. PRESIDENT DRINKS ON OFFER. I THINK WE HAVE SOME PHILOSOPHY FOR OUR BUDGET APPROACH THIS LAST YEAR AS WELL SO THANK YOU. MISTER STORMERS JUST ASKED TO SEND QUESTIONS AROUND. CONTACT TRACING AND TESTING FOR YOUR. DON'T MISS A STORY STILL THERE JUST CHECKING. I NEED TO LEARN HOW TO HIT THAT YOU COULD NOT BE BUT I MY APOLOGIES THE WORST OF. SO FROM THAT FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT OF WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME. LUXURIES THAT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY CALLING SEVEN TERMS OF ACCESS TO DIRECT MEDICAL- FACILITIES LIKE THEY DO. AND SO FROM A FROM A- THE CSU STUDENT VANTAGE POINT THAT THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE EITHER PRIVATE- THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH SERVICE CARRIER OR ALSO DAY AT THAT CAMPUS HEALTH SEARCH SERVICES CENTER RIGHT- SO THAT'S- THAT'S- GENERALLY. WHAT WE'RE STUDENT WOULD WOULD GO FOR THAT TYPE OF CARE I THINK MAYBE- I'LL PUT THAT I PRESIDENT NELSON ON THE SPOT HE'LL BE IN YOUR PANEL TO IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE FULSOME. PLANTATION FROM WHAT A PARTICULAR CAMPUS HAS TO OFFER IN TERMS OF CONTACT TRACING. AND TESTING OF STUDENTS BUT I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THAT THAT BREADTH OF KNOWLEDGE OR- UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE AT THIS POINT. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH LIKE ME TO ANSWER THAT HOUSING QUESTION IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE AT MISTER PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT OVER AT ON OUR CAMPUSES WE'RE RUNNING OUT ON AVERAGE ABOUT A 20% CAPACITY OF OUR STUDENT HOUSING WE HAVE A- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT- DEBT SERVICE OUT ON OUR STUDENT HOUSING IN A VERY SPEC CANVAS RIGHT DEPENDING ON IF IT'S MORE READRESIDENTIAL OR OR OR MORE A COMMUTER NATURE. OF BUT IT IS A CONCERN- GENERALLY SPEAKING- BASED ON A COUPLE OF CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH- WITH OUR CAMPUSES- IN THAT ARE CFO'S. I WOULD SAY THAT MOST CAMPUSES ARE FEELING LIKE THEY CAN WEATHER- THIS PARTICULAR TERM PERHAPS INTO THE SPRINGIF THINGS. GET MORE DIFFICULT FOR IT THINGS WILL GET MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR HOUSING COME FALL- TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO COVER UP COSTS FOR STUDENT HOUSING. AND SO JUST UP APPRECIATE THAT COVERS A WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OPTIONS YOU'RE CONSIDERING THAT INTO. OF COURSE YOU UTILITY SERVICE IS ONE OF THOSE OF WE HAVE SOME RESERVES WE CAN WE CAN DO THERE- AND THEN IT WILL IT WILL ALSO DEPEND ON IN TERMS OF- IF. AND HOW MUCH WE CAN REPOPULATE GOING FORWARD- FOR THE SPRING WE ARE STILL VIRTUAL AND SO WHAT LIKE I SAID THE CFO'S OF SAID WELL WE THINK WE CAN GENERALLY GET THROUGH THE SPRING IF. YOU KNOW WE'RE AT OUR CURRENT OCCUPANCY LEVELS. BEYOND THAT THEN IF WE GET INTO THE FALL AND WE HAVE THE SAME LEVELS OF OCCUPANCY THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE CHALLENGE WITH IN TERMS OF- BEING ABLE TO COVER DEBT SERVICE BEING ABLE TO. PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF- bTINUED EMPLOYEE- THAT STOPPED THE PLOYS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE STUDENT HOUSING PROGRAM SECTOR BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO FEW MEMBERS FIRST. FOR AYE MR STORM SO YOU STAY RIGHT THERE AT FIRST MISTER O'DONNELL. YET THANK YOU I DO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS THESE SEE I DID NOT. GET AN ANSWER FROM THE CSU- I THE SPOKE TO QUESTION ONE WHICH IS ABOUT THE BACKFILL WITH IT WITH THE- CARE DOLLARS- BUT- WITH REGARD TO- FLEXIBILITY FOR THE C. ISSUE DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY. OF BILLS IN YOUR BUDGET. SO THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS YES. I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS WE WOULD SURE APPRECIATE MORE- RIGHT NOW WHAT WE HAVE THIS WE HAVE STATUTE THAT SAYS THAT WE ARE ALLOWED WITHIN WITH R. C. ISSUE FUNDS SO THIS WOULD BE PARKING. HOUSING AND- EVEN OUR OPERATION OUR CORE OR CORE AND NON CORE FOR WE HAVE THE- STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO LOAN FUNDS BETWEEN- THE- LOAN MONIES BETWEEN THOSE FUNDS. HOWEVER WE CANNOT AND DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER MONIES BETWEEN THOSE FUNDS. LIKE YOU AT THE STATE LEVEL. IN THE GENERAL FUND YOU RECEIVE REVENUES FROM A WHOLE HOST OF DIFFERENT SOURCES RIGHT YEAH HARPER TAXES PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND YOU CAN MELT THOSE TOGETHER. AND YOU CAN EXPAND THEM ON WHAT YOU NEED TO AT SIX AT. THE UNIVERSITY IN A WAY WERE HAMSTRUNG INTHAT WAY. WHERE WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE ALL OF OUR REVENUE SOURCES ESPECIALLY A COVERT ON. TALK ABOUT THE COVERT SEASON HERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY THEN BE ABLE TO UTILIZE ALL OF OUR REVENUE SOURCES IN ORDER TO MITIGATE. POTENTIAL LAYOFFS TO MITIGATE COST IMPLICATE. ANY DEFICITS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE IN A PARTICULAR PROGRAM ON A PARTICULAR CAMPUS SO. SO ONE THING THAT WE THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IS TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY. THROUGH A STATUTORY CHANGE TO CHANGE THAT TO A TRANSFER OF. FUNDS BETWEEN- TRANSFER OF MONEY BETWEEN FUNDS. OTHER STRAIGHT AFTER THAT OF COURSE- BUT- THAT'S THAT'S ONE THAT WAY WE COULD HAVE LOOKS BUT THE OTHER THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE A FORTY- AT THE MOMENT LIKE. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DOESN'T EVEN THE STATE HOUSE. WHERE YOU COULD- YOU COULD BORROW FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES RIGHT NOW. OUR ONLY AVENUE RIGHT NOW IS TOO LOW BETWEEN FUND SOURCES. OR TO UTILIZE THE RESERVES THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD. THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES OF THAT THAT THAT FLEXIBILITY- JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION WITH REGARD TO NEXT YEAR'S FRESHMAN CLASS. SO I THINK I'VE READ LATELY THAT THIS ISSUE IS- EDUCATING MORE STUDENTS THAN EVER HAS. SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT WHAT WOULD NEXT YEAR'S FRESHMAN CLASS LOOK LIKE MY TO BE LARGER. SMALLER BECAUSE SOME STUDENTS MIGHT HELD OFF. A YEAR MAYBE YOU MIGHT KNOW NUMBERS ASSOCIATED THAT MAYBE NOT. DO DO DO YOU HAVE ANY. YOU HAVE ANY PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT NEXT YEAR'S FRESHMAN CLASS MY LOOK ON. YES SIR THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT THE BIG CRYSTAL BALL QUESTION. GENERALLY SPEAKING UP FROM OUR ROLE WITH EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN OUR TRANSFER STUDENTS THAT BEARS ALMOST TO THE DOCK TO THE NUMBER. A SLIGHT DECREASE IN OUR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN. AND THERE COULD BE A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS WHY THAT'S THE CASE BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS ALLOWED US T MAINTAIN OUR ROLE THAT HAS HAS BEEN THE FACT THAT WE KNOW WE ANNOUNCED EARLIER INTENTIONS OF GOING VIRTUAL. JUST BEING ABLE TO ALLOW FAMILIES THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN FOR IT. SO IF ARE WHAT WE THINK IS OUR SUCCESS IN IN DECIDING WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BE FOR A SHORT PERSON. I THINK THAT WILL HELP INFORM US WHETHER FRESHMAN ENTER THE UNIVERSITY OR OR HAVE IT- THERE'S A DEMAND FOR FRESHMEN TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A WAYS OUT THERE IS JUST AN OUT THERE I WOULD THINK THOUGH THAT IF THE ECONOMY PROCESS AS IT IS- AND IF IT PERSISTS AS IT IS IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL TO. GAIN EMPLOYMENT THAT DO OTHER THINGS SO THERE MAY BE GREATER DEMAND TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION- BUT IT'S RIGHT NOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO FOR SEE WHAT THE ANSWER IS ON THAT INVOLVED TWENTY ONE. WHAT WHAT IS THE UNIVERSITY PROJECTING. ALL RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROJECTIONS THAT I THAT I'M AWARE OF FOR NEXT YOU PROBABLY WON'T HAVE LOCATIONS OR DO I ASSUME AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. THEY WOULD BE OUR DATABASE. YET THE END OF THIS MONTH FOR OUR CAMPUS BUT IT COULD IT COULD GO INTO THAT THE NEW YORK AS WELL SO. OKAY SO IS IT IS THE IS THE APPLICATION. DEADLINE TYPICALLY AS I RCALL. AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. IT'S THOSE APPLICATIONS FOR THE C. ISSUE AT LEAST ARE DUE AT THE END OF. NOVEMBER IS THAT BEEN ALTERED PUSH BACK AT ALL OR- IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE CAMPUS- BUT- FOR THE MOST PART. WE CAN HAVE A CUT OFF DATE OF. OF NOVEMBER LIKE YOU'RE SAYING OR COULD. DEPENDING ON DEMAND A PARTICULAR CAMPUSES. IT COULD BE IT COULD BE LATER IN THE YEAR YOU COULD BE EVEN. WELL IN THE SPRING TO SENDING OUT HOW MUCH OF A ROLE THAT IS AT THAT CAMPUS SO THE REASON WHY I THINK. SO NOW IT'S MARKETED TO TODAY. IT'S NOVEMBER THIRTIETH BUT IT COULD CHANGE. IT DEPENDS ON THE GENERAL ANSWERS IS OKAY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE NOT. ENROLLMENT GUY- YOUR NUMBERS GUY FOR BUT BUT BUT IT DOES BUT IT DOES DEPEND ON IT IT DOES DEPEND ON THE ON THE PARTICULAR CAMPUS. SO IS THAT YOUR EVERY YEAR IS NOT JUST TRUE IN. THIS SITUATION IT. IT CAN CHANGE IT CAN CHANGE YEAR TO YEAR DEPENDING ON HOW ENROLLMENT IS DOING AT OUR PREVIOUS CAMP ZIP FOR EXAMPLE. DEMAND IN THE LONG BEACH STATE. AT FULLER TEN. VERY HIGH THAT'S THAT'S UP IN OUR EXPERIENCE. IT'S ORT OF THE ROLE THAT DEADLINES ARE EARLIER IN THE YEAR. HOWEVER WE HAVE A- NUMBER OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES SONOVA HUMBLE SAN FRANCISCO. WHERE THOSE CAMPUSES. ARE EXPERIENCING LESS THAN ROBUST DEMAND AND LESSEN ROLL WITH. IT SO THAT THEY WILL KEEP THEIR ADMISSION. OR MISSION WENT OPEN LONGER ANDERSON ALLOW FOR THAT. MOMENT OF IT. SO SOMEONE LIKE CHICO WORM MANY STUDENTS. MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. MIGHT EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT IN OUR OWN. THAT CHOI EVERY IS IT JUST BECAUSE A COVERT. THAT'S TRUE EVERY YEAR I THINK- BUT- EVEN BEFORE COVE ED ARE ENROLLMENTS IN THE FAR NORTHERN- CAMPUSES HAVE IT SOFT OKAY. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU I TWO MORE QUESTIONS PERSEUS YOU MISTER MEDINA MR ARAMBULA THANK YOU A RYAN I'D I'D LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE DECISION- INITIALLY TO NOT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES- AND I THINK THAT THAT DECISION STAYED FOR AROUND SIX MONTHS I BELIEVE. AND NOW THE SITUATION WHERE EMPLOYEES ARE BEING LAID OFF- IF YOU COULD JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE RATIONALE FOR THOSE DECISIONS AND WHAT CHANGE TO GET US TO WHERE WE ARE HAVING TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES NOW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA WE'VE BEEN. DOING OUR BEST TO KEEP EVERYBODY IS EMPLOYED AS POSSIBLE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A NUMBER OF. LEAVE PROGRAMS- BEGINNING AT THE AT THE START OF THAT THAT- THE PANDEMIC. I STARTED OFF VERY EARLY ON WITH THOSE WHO ARE AGE SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE AND THOSE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS SO WE OFFERED. A NUMBER OF HOURS OF LEAVE THAT AND THEN WE ALSO HAD OTHER TYPES OF LEAVES THAT IF YOU COULD WORK ON SITE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE SAY UP TO THREE OR FOUR HOURS OF WORK THERE. ANOTHER ONE WAS IF YOU HAD TO CARE FOR KIDS OR YOU HAVE YOU WERE CARING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK OR YOU YOURSELF WERE SICK. GET A NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOWED AT ALLOWED EMPLOYEES- LITERALLY A MONTH TO TWO MONTHS AT A TIME TO BE ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE AND RETAIN POINT RETAINER HEALTH CARE. OKAY SO THAT WAS THAT THAT'S THE BACKDROP. WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO THEN. THIS POINT TIME WHERE YOU'RE NOTICING NOW THAT WE HAVE. WELL LET ME AT LEAST LET ME LET ME MAKE TWO TO TWO GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES SO. THE FIRST OF A PLOY IS WITH US IN OUR NON CORE AREAS TOO. SO THOSE ARE LIKE BOOKSTORES AND THINGS LIKE THAT- WHEN THERE WAS NO- NO NO FOOD SERVICE OR THE BOOKSTORES WERE CLOSE THOSE ENTERPRISES- HAD TO HAD TO LEAD A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES GO MOSTLY STUDENT WORKERS FOR THE MOST PART THERE- AND I WAS JUST BECAUSE THERE IS NO REVENUE COMING IN AND THERE WAS NOBODY THAT WAS THAT WAS. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BEING ON CAMPUS BECAUSE THE CAMPUSES WERE CLOSED WHEN IT COMES TO THE REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES WE PROVIDED ALL OF THESE LEAVE OPPORTUNITIES- THROUGH THE- AT THROUGH THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR SO JUNE THIRTY AT THAT THAT EXTENDED BECAUSE OF THAT THE FEDERAL CARES ACT. OF CARE SO WE HAVE WE HAVE THOSE WHAT IS BOILING DOWN TO NOW IN TERMS OF OUR THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR ORIGINAL LAYOFF NOTICES. IS THAT WE HAVE EITHER A LACK OF WORK OR WE HAVE A LACK OF FUNDS RELATED TO THESE. SO FOR IT LIKE I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY AT THE EXAMPLE WAS SENT ON THE STATE. THOSE WERE STATE EMPLOYEES THAT WORKED IN DINING SERVICES AND THERE WAS. NO DINING SERVICES BEING PROVIDED ON CAMPUS THE CAMPUS WAS LARGELY SHUTTERED. AND SO WE THEN HAD TO BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF WORK AND A LACK OF FUNDS RELATED TO IT WE HAD TO THEN LATE NOTICE THOSE FOLKS. BUT LIKE I ALSO SAID IN MY TESTIMONY IS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING AND MEETING CONFERRING WITH THESE UNITS TO REALLY TRY TO FIND GOOD PLACES FOR A PLACE THAT WERE THERE MAY BE A CLASSIFICATION OR TWO THAT MAY BE ABLE TO GO FROM BACK AND FORTH- IN THE CASE OF CINEMA. OF THOSE WITH SERVICE A NUMBER OF THOSE WHO SERVICE EMPLOYEES WERE CONVERTED OVER TEXT AUDIO OR THEY WERE ABLE TO BE RE HIRED ON A TEMPORARY BASIS SORT DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. BUT AT SOME POINT IT DOES HAVE TO GIVE WHERE YOU YOU DO RUN OUT OF FUNDS IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE TO CONTINUE WITH SOME OF THESE LAYOFFS. BUT THEY'RE. THERE THAT IS A KIND OF A FOR I RESORT AND TERMS OF. IF WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY AND BECAUSE THAT SERVICES NO LONGER BEING PROVIDED DURING THE PANDEMIC THEM THAT'S TO BE THE CASE NOBODY COMES TO THEM HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE REHIRED WITH THINGS CHANGE WITH THE POTENTIAL PANDEMIC LEAVES WE HAVE A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHERE EMPLOYEES CAN HAVE ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE YEARS TO. FIRST FIRST RIGHT OF RETURN BACK TO WORK SO THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER ADDED BENEFIT SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE'RE AT THIS POINT IN SOME INSTANCES- BUT IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF THE FOLKS SYSTEM WIDE. AS LONG AS THINGS DON'T CONTINUE TO SPIRAL DOWN IN TERMS OF THE PANDEMIC AND STATE FUNDING WE HOPE THAT WE CAN MITIGATE THIS EVEN FURTHER WITH HIRING FREEZES AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BUT IF THINGS GET WORSE- I CAN'T PROMISE TO YOU THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ADDITIONAL LAYOFF NOTICES IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER AMBER. THANK YOU AND- MY QUESTION IS CAN BE FOR YOU MISTER STORM IF I CAN- FIRST I WANT TO ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHT ENROLLMENT IT APPEARS THAT NATIONALLY WE'VE HAD ENROLLMENT DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 4% AND YES THERE ARE THREE CAMPUSES IN THE CSU SYSTEM THAT ARE SHOWING ALL TIME RECORD HIGH ENROLLMENTS WHETHER IT'S SACRAMENTO STATE. FRESNO STATE OR CSU BAKERSFIELD AND WOULD LIKE AND HOPE YOU COULD OR YOU MAY PUNCH TO- ROBERT NELSON WHO'S COMING LATER TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING TO ENCOURAGE ENROLLMENT TENDS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WELL YOU KNOW I THINK I DON'T KNOW ALL THE REASONS WHY OUR ROLE THAT IS TAKING OFF IN THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT WITH THE CENTRAL pTALKING ABOUT A CENTRAL VALLEY CAMPUSES RIGHT. YOU JUST SEALED-BY A LARGER GROWTH IN IN THE POPULATION- GOING THAT DIRECTION- YOU ALSO HAVE I THINK THE INSTANCE OF FOR NOW THIRTY YEARS YOU HAVE IT BEING BEATEN TO EVERY CHILD'S HEAD IN SCHOOL. THAT YOU SHOULD GO ON TO TRY TO BE A FOUR YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHT IT'S SO YOU HAVE A EXCEEDING NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE WANTING HER OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE WANTING TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND GO TO HIGHER AT REPUBLIC THE OTHER FACTOR IS OF COURSE- DATE THERE ARE ARE ARE. NO OPTIONS FOR LESS OPTIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT THEN. I SAY THEY WERE IN THE RECENT PAST- BUT I THINK YOU SEE THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A HUGE DEMAND GROWING AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE. AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING- BECAUSE- HISTORICALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS AS NOT HAD. EXCEEDINGLY HIGH RATES OF. HIGHER ED. I PARTICIPATION IT GRADUATION TENS OF TETRA. BUT MAYBE MAYBE A PRESIDENT NELSON COULD SHUT A LITTLE BIT BETTER LIGHT ON IT FOR FROM THE SIXTIES PERSPECTIVE. I MAY BE BIASED BUT AS A CENTRAL VALLEY NATIVE I THINK OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANY IN MY COMMUNITY ALLOW US TO ALSO GET BACK TO THIS GREAT STATE SO. I'M QUITE APPRECIATIVE OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE INTO BOTH THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISTURBING. MY NEXT QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER STORM THOUGH IF I COULD- I'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT FLEXIBILITY AND- ONE OF THE FLEXIBILITIES WE DID WITHIN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT WAS LOOKING OUT READ THE ABILITY TO RE DIRECT ON SPENT- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS AND WANTED TO ASK YOU IF THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU HAVE. A BEGUN TO DO TO MEET TO HELP TO COVER THE INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS THE- OTHER OPERATING COSTS. WELL I THINK IN THE SHORT ANSWER IS AT THIS POINT WE ARE. NOT FLEXING THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONEY TO BE USED OPERATE- EXPENSES AT THIS POINT. IN THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT. IS THE FACT THAT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF NEW STATE FUNDING. OR BOND FUNDING FROM GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND VOTES TO BE ABLE TO. SIGNIFICANTLY ADDRESS OUR MOST PRESSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS- RIGHT NOW OUR FOR OUR ONE OF OUR FIRST APPROACHES IN TERMS OF. SATISFIED WITH THE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF THE OPERATING FUND OUR CORE OUR CORE FOR OUR CORPORATE JET IS USING OUR RESERVES AS DIRECTED WITHIN THE BUDGET ACT. AND THEN ALSO USING SOME OF THESE OTHER TOOLS THAT I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT HIRING FREEZES. AND REDUCING TRAVEL THAT SORT OF THING WE REALLY WANT TO TRY TO PROTECT THE USE OF THAT- THAT REMAINING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ONE WE HAD A LOT OF A LOT OF CAMPUSES THAT WERE ON THE BRINK AND ARE STILL MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION TOWARDS FIXING SOME OF THE ROCK MORE PRESSING NEEDS. AND WITH THE FAILURE OF PROP THIRTEEN ON THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY BALLOT WITH NO FORESEEABLE G. O. BONDS- FOR FACILITIES GOING FORWARD AND WITH US IN A IN A DOWNWARD ECONOMIC CYCLE RIGHT NOW. WE JUST FEEL AT THIS POINT LET'S LET'S HOLD THAT FLEXIBILITY AT BAY AND TRY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE KEY THINGS BECAUSE EVENTUALLY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE THINGS FAIL YOU AND IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO ADDRESS THEM NOW THE WAIT UNTIL THE END. WHEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY POTENTIALLY IN YOUR IN THE IN THE IN THE DEPTHS OF HAVING A REALLY TOUGH BUDGETARY TIME AS A CAMPUS AND THEN YOU HAVE A WATER LIKE GO OUT OR THE ROOF IS THIS WINTER WAS THE WINTER THAT PRINT IT. AND SO OUR CAMPUSES ARE STILL STILL HOLDING TO THE USE OF THAT MONEY- WE'VE GIVEN THE DIRECTION TO THE CAMPUS IS TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT ROAD. IF THINGS DO PERSISTENT GET WORSE I THINK THAT YOU MAY SEE A CHANGE POTENTIALLY BUT AT THIS POINT WE WANT TO TRY TO PROTECT THE SMALL AMOUNT OF TO FOR ME THIS MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. FOR THE BEST USE WE GET TODAY. I JUST SIMPLY JUST ONE TO IT UP TO I HAVEN'T HEARD IT AND DISCUSS. THUS FAR TODAY AND IT IS ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOL CHEST. FOR US TO BE RIGHT TO ADDRESS AS WE GO FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER LIVING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS FOR- FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS HEARING MISTER SNOW REYES. A POINT THAT I WANTED TO GO OVER WITH HIM BUT ALSO WITH YOU SEE- AND I APPRECIATE. ALL THE EXTRAS THAT YOU'RE BRINGING TO THIS- WE'RE% DEALING WITH- YOU'D MENTION ENROLLMENT FIGURES. FOR NORTH BAY NORTH COAST SERVING CAMPUSES FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATE TO HUMBOLDT. AND WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH BOTH THE DOUBLE WHAMMY OF THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO MULTIPLE YEARS OF WILD FIRES. THAT HAVE BOTH- OF COURSE. BURNED DOWN THE HOMES OF. STUDENTS AND PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS EVEN THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT AT CINEMA STATE BUT ALSO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. AND I WANT TO ASK YOU- BUT BOTH SYSTEMS BUT TED BUT I. YOU FOR CSU YOU'RE SERVING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES YOU SEE. WOULD BE MORE MATRICULATING FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES AND WHETHER R NOT YOU SEEN. THE IMPACTS OF BOTH. THE WILD FIRES. OVER THOSE YEARS AND THAT IMPACT ON ENROLLMENT BECAUSE IT ON THE STATE. IS MAYBE MORE OF A COMMUNITY SERVING- IT DOES HAVE THAT IT'S A BIT OF A DESTINATION BUT YOU KNOW FIRST HUMBLE BEING MUCH MORE SO BUT ISTHERE THEY'RE ALL COMMUNITY SERVING. IN ALL OF THOSE. COUNTIES OR NEARBY COUNTIES HAVE BEEN SO IMPACTED BY FIRES AS THEY HAVE BEEN BY THE PANDEMIC. THAT EITHER YOU HAVE YOU SEEN. THE RESULTS OR OR OUTCOMES BECAUSE OF THOSE- OBSTACLES FOR STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN IT AND MATRICULATING. OR COULD YOU BE MORE SENSITIVE TO THAT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S MUCH MORE MY QUESTION. FOR YOU SEE WOULD BE. HOW HAVE YOU ADAPTED FOR- FOR THOSE CHALLENGES THAT THOSE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS OR RETURNING STUDENTS MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. ALREADY ALL STAR DENNIS LEVINE- SO I THINK IT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT- WE DO- I LIKE SEE IF YOU WE DO HAVE A- A- APPLICATION DEADLINE OF NOVEMBER THIRTIETH IT IS EXTENDED TO. DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST FOUR- FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS BUT- THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE EXTENDED THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF WILDFIRES AND THE NOT ONLY THE INABILITY. FOR OUR STUDENTS TO- APPLY BUT ALSO THE ABILITY OF SEVERAL OF THEM TO TAKE STANDARDIZED TESTS ARE BACK WHEN WE REQUIRED STANDARDIZED TESTS SO WE HAVE. OUR EXTENDED THAT- YOU KNOW CAMPUS AS WELL WE ARE NOT IN THE DIRECT- ZONE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED QUITE A BIT BY- THE- EQUALITY AND WE HAVE JUST ADOPTED A SYSTEM WIDE. AIR QUALITY STANDARD ALL RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE UNIFORMS VISIONS ON WHEN I CAMPUS IS- WHEN CLASSES ARE HELD WHEN OUTDOOR WORK IN ATHLETIC ACTIVITY- I TAKES PLACE BUT- I THINK THE VERY GOOD WE'VE NOT SEEN ANY DECLINES- WE DON'T. QUITE HAVE IS AS MUCH A REGIONAL A STUDENT POPULATION AS THE AS THE CAL STATE SYSTEM SO WE HAVE NOT SEEN DECLINES- BASED ON THIS BUT I DO THINK WE WANT TO BE A PRETTY. PARTICULARLY COGNIZANT OF OUR STUDENTS WHO MAY BE FACING- I CHALLENGES BEYOND THE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF THEIR APPLICATIONS. THANK YOU MISTER ROSTRUM. BUT FOR THIS ISSUES PER. IS THAT- I THINK YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT MR LEVINE THAT THE FACT THAT. YOU HAVE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS ON TOP OF THE PANDEMIC. AFFECTING HUMBLE IN CINEMA IN SAN FRANCISCO THE LIFE TAKE. I THINK WHAT I THINK ONE THING FROM THE FROM CINEMA AND A HUMBLE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. THERE'S AND THIS APPLIES TO CHICO AS WELL IS THAT THOSE CAMPUSES DRAW A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THAT THEIR STUDENTS FROM OUT OF AREA AROUND A REGION. AND SO YOU SEE PART OF THAT PLAYING OUT EVEN THIS YEAR- WITH THE FACT THAT- UP. YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT INSTINCTIVE NATURE DON'T TO WANT TO. STAY AT HOME AND NOT GO ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE STATE IN ORDER TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OVER THERE- SO THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF IT BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING IN TERMS OF THE DISSERVICE TO THOSE REGIONAL STUDENTS. UP THERE IS EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT A WEALTH OF. OPPORTUNITY THAT IS EXTENDED TO ALL THOSE LOCAL STUDENTS SO IF YOU'RE A IF YOU'RE A NORTH STATE STUDENT OR YOU'RE IN THAT THE HUMBLE AREA OR IN THE SNOWBERRY THERE'S- THERE'S- AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY THERE- SO IT IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT A- SITUATION WHERE- STUDENTS LOCALLY ARE ARE. ARE HAVING TO COMPETE WITH OUT OF AREA STUDENTS THERE'S A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC THERE AND IT AND THAT IS IN THE CASE IN TERMS OF ADMISSIONS I THINK THE ONE CHALLENGES THOUGH OF COURSE IS THAT- YET THE JUST THAT. THE DESIRE TO BE ENROLLED IN THOSE CAMPUSES AT THIS POINT WHATEVER WHATEVER THE TREND IS IN TERMS OF THE- AND- AND- IT STUDENTS ATTENDING. THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE DOWN HUMBOLDT HAS HAD A LONGER STRETCH OF THIS- THEY'VE GONE BACK SEVERAL- ACADEMIC YEARS WHERE THEIR ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN SOFT. SO NUMBERS ONLY BEEN EXPERIENCING THAT LATELY BUT INTERNET BUT BUT ACT THE RIVER QUESTION OF WHETHER THOSE STUDENTS LOCALLY ARE BEING SERVED. AT THAT UNIVERSITY THERE'S AMPLE OPPORTUNITY THE QUESTION IS GETTING THROUGH ALL OF THESE WILDFIRES AND ALL THESE PANDEMICS AND ALL THE OTHER PRESSURES ECONOMIC PRESSURES WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO ATTEND OR NOT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY DRIVEN BY. THE CHOICE OF THE STUDENT FAMILY THEMSELVES. I THINK MISTRESS NOW. OKAY YOU I ROBUST QUESTIONING THEIR FRIEND UC AND CSU ABOUT THIS ISSUE WE HAVE TWO OTHER MAJOR SEGMENTS IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH TWO MILLION STUDENTS AND ARE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE SO WE HAVE AT LEAST SET NEVER MET WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF ALEX GRAVES. WITH THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CALIFORNIA SERVICE START WITH LEE SETS. CAN YOU GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF BOTH THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE TO AND HIRED COMMITTEE. I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TAKING TIME TO LISTEN TO OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION. MY NAME IS WITH THAT AND IT AND THE- I SEEM TO RECALL FINANCING FACILITIES PLANNING I HAVE THE HONOR OF WORKING TO REPRESENT TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS AT A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES. THE STATE'S CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES PROVIDE A RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AIMED AT SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY IT STUDENTS SEEKING FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS CERTIFICATES TO ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS OR TO EARN A DEGREE TO TRANSFER. TODAY I AM GOING TO SHARE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED OF EDUCATION. AND OUR EFFORTS TO ENGAGE IRAN ROLE STUDENTS AND HOW WE MORE. THAT WERE ALLOCATED BY THE STATE. AS THE WORLD CONTINUES TO GRAPPLE WITH THE CONSEQUENCESOF COVER NINETEEN THAT AREN'T EVEN IMPACTED IT EQUITIES OF OUR ECONOMIC RECESSION HAVE BEEN GROSSLY APPARENT CALIFORNIA FACES THE DICHOTOMY OF AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT EXACERBATE INEQUALITIES FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS WILL FURTHER ENRICHING THE WEALTHY. THE STATE NEED TO PLAN FOR AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH A PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HOW MANY CALLS. HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL TO THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO COPE WITH NINETEEN SINCE SPRING OUR COLLEGES HAVE OPERATED EMERGENCY CENTERS COBA NINETEEN PATIENT OVERFLOW FACILITIES AND COLIN NINETEEN TESTING SITES FOR THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONTINUE TO EDUCATE THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S NURSES AND FIREFIGHTERS AS WELL AS EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS. BUT OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST HIT POPULATION IN ALL OF HIGHER EDUCATION. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE TONYA A STUDENT AT CHAFEE AND WORKING MOTHER WHO MADE THE DIFFICULT DECISION OF CAUSING HER EDUCATION TO WORK ANOTHER JOB PART TIME JUST TO SUPPLEMENT FOR LOST INCOME DURING THIS PANDEMIC. STUDENTS LIKE HONEY I DON'T HAVE FINANCIAL AID AS A SAFETY NET WELL TWO THIRDS THIS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ATTEND CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES ONLY 7% RECEIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THROUGH CAL GRANT. AND IN A SURVEY AND TOWN HALLS BY BOAT C. SACK IN THE STUDENT CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA GIVE ME COLLEGES. REPORTED LOSING MOST OF THE FINANCIAL INCOME AND HAVING CHANGES. AND THEIR FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS. FURTHER MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL STIMULUS OF WITH NOTRE ABSENT FOR SOME OF OUR POPULATIONS SUCH AS DREAMERS PART TIME STUDENTS AND- IN THIS STIMULUS DOLLARS. AND THOSE RESOURCES OR INSTEAD OF SUPPLANTED OR TEMPORARILY FILLED THROUGH RESERVES AND OTHER A CATEGORICAL. THESE ARE ALL TEMPORARY BANDAID ON ISSUE. AND WE KNOW THAT THE TOPIC TODAY IS REALLY TO FOCUS ON AREAS LIKE ENROLLMENT SO SURE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE SAW FOR SPRING AS WELL WHAT WE'RE SEEING FOR A FALL. TODAY'S CALL COPULATION HAS SHIFTED ITS FAR MORE DIVERSE IN FACT 64% CALIFORNIA'S ENROLLEES OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND 40% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE TWENTY FIVE AND OLDER WE SERVE LOTS OF ADULT LEARNERS. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGE IS A PLACE GREATER FOCUS ON OUTREACH TO POST TRADITIONAL STUDENT POPULATION. THIS WORK IS CHALLENGING BUT IT'S CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY OF THE STATE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR LEADERS CAN CONTINUE TO BE A STEADFAST PARTNER. SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE MOMENTUM. AND CONTRARY TO SOME OF OUR SPEC. AND WORRIES COMPLETIONS IN SPRING TWENTY pOUR SYSTEM. AND FAST ACTION LIMITED THAT THE CLIENTS THAT WE SAW IN SPRING TO DEATH UNDER RESPONSIVENESS OF OUR SYSTEM COMMITMENT OF OUR STAFF FACULTY AND OUR LEADERS TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM AND FOCUS ON PUTTING STUDENTS FIRST AND ADVANCING THEIR SUCCESS. WE PUT STUDENTS FIRST BY GIVING THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ON ANY OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WE TRANSITION TO ONLINE WITHIN A MATTER OF A WEEK. WE ISSUED GUIDANCE FLEXING AND ALLOWING THE USE OF SOME OF OUR CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS FOR A ONE TIME EMERGENCY GRANTS BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT STUDENTS HAD A FINANCIAL GAP THEY WERE DEALING WITH. WE MADE MERGING TWO GRANTS EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO RECEIVE WE PROVIDED LAPTOPS AND WIFI HOTSPOTS FOR STUDENTS SENATE MEAL PROGRAMS. ISSUED EXCUSE WITHDRAWALS PROVIDED STUDENT FEE REFUNDS THESE RAPID AND FAST ACTING STUDENT CENTERED ACTIONS MADE SURE STRUGGLING STUDENTS ARE NOT PLACED ON ACADEMIC PROBATION THEY DIDN'T LOSE ACCESS TO THEIR FINANCIAL AID I HAD SOME. AT LEAST MODEST FUNDS TO NAVIGATE THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE PANDEMIC THESE APPS ACTION STOP THE WORSE FROM HAPPENING. BUT OUR CHALLENGES KNOW THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES ARE FRALEY ATTACHED TO EDUCATION OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING MANY OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE NOW UBIQUITOUS ACROSS HIGHER EDUCATION UNCERTAINTY IN EMPLOYMENT DAY CARE UNCERTAINTY SHIFTING WORK SCHEDULES. UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES. MANY OF THESE THIS AND ARE NOT NEW FOR OUR STUDENTS BUT THEY'VE BEEN HIGH BY POPE IN NINETEEN. BUT ARE STILL PART OF THE INSTANT OF ARE STILL HAVE TO HAVE HAD TO OVERCOME ALL THE TIME. IN THIS SIGNED POSTER CLEAR. ARE STILL DESPERATELY NEED FINANCIAL AID ACCESS. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FALL. WE HAVE A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM- LIMITED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY- PROVIDE A LACK OF REAL TIME INFORMATION WILL HAVE ACTUAL BY JANUARY FIFTEENTH WHEN AND COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS REPORT. MOST ON ON DEFAULT TWENTY TWENTY TERM. SO IN ORDER TO OBTAIN PRELIMINARY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS FALL WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE R. P. GROUP. IN OUR PRELIMINARY SAMPLE INDICATES THAT HEAD COUNT ENROLLMENT IS DOWN BY ABOUT 7% FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY. BASED ON THE SAMPLE FTS IS DOWN BY AN ESTIMATED 10% FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY. AN EARLY SURVEY DATA INDICATES TO POSSIBLE PATTERNS STUDENTS ARE TAKING FEWER COURSES AND STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN ARE FACING GREATER CHALLENGES. WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR DATA. IN A VERY COMPREHENSIVE CENSUS SURVEY THAT INDICATED THAT LOW INCOME AND LOWER AND OLDER STUDENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO PASS THEIR EDUCATIONAL PLANS FOR FALL. BECAUSE THEY HAD INTERRUPTIONS IN THEIR INCOME. BY SUPPORTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN FEED THESE TRENDS. THE CANCERS OFFICE HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO RE ENGAGE IN SUPPORT OF DISTRICTS IS IN RE ENGAGING STUDENTS WE'VE LAUNCHED TWO MAJOR ENROLLMENT CAMPAIGNS OF IT ACROSS THE STATE. THESE TO COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA CAMPAIGNS FOCUSED ON STAYING AND ROLLED AND LATE START SO THAT WE CAN PROMOTE COURSES THAT WERE AVAILABLE LATER IN THE SEMESTER FOR OUR STUDENTS THESE CAMPAIGNS FOCUSED ON SOCIAL MEDIA MUSIC SITES THAT. WERE OFFERED IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. AND SPRING MAKE COLLEGE HAVE. NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THE DOLLARS AND YOU I'M MAC. THIS CALL AND TECH. EQUIPMENT TRAINING TO A QUICK TRANSITION TO ONLINE- ADDING NEW METALLIC EASE OF LEARNING AND ALL OF THE SPECIFICALLY ON TECHNOLOGY R. COSTA BEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION YOU CAN VIEW ON THAT. FUNDS COMBINED ARE COLLEGES OF LOST EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN IRAQ REVENUE FROM ENTERPRISE SERVICES LIKE CAFETERIAS BOOKSTORES PARKING LOTS AND OTHER SOURCES THAT ARE NEXT TO OFFSET KEY ACADEMIC SUPPORT ON CAMPUSES. IN SPRING OUR COST PER STUDENT HAVE INCREASED NEARLY 4% WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS FIGURE WILL GO UP AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY. FURTHER CERTAIN COURSES DON'T HOLD VIRTUAL MODELS THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES OFFER AND ARE CHALLENGING TO OFFER DURING THE PANDEMIC. THESE INCLUDE COURSES IN NURSING HOMES AND MEDICAL CENTERS CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTERS PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND OTHERS LIKE CTE HALF TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND LIMITED CAPACITY FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FACULTY FOR COLLEGES REDUCE CAPACITY MEANS INCREASED COSTS. WILSHIRE BRIEF WHAT WE GET WITH. AND YOU OF THE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RECEIVED TOTAL DEFERRALS OF ONE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN APPORTIONMENT FROM. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND AS YOU KNOW DEFERRALS CAN PERMIT AN AUTHORIZED DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN PROGRAMMATIC LEVELS BY CREATING OUT YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND WHILE THEY PREVENT CONCERT WE ARE WE- WHILE THESE ARE PREFERRED OVER. WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN MAKE A LIMITED INCREASES IN THE FUTURE. AND SO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WAS TASKED WITH DETERMINING METHODOLOGY FOR DISTRIBUTING THE BURDEN OF DEFERRALS THIS YEAR AND TRADITIONALLY DEFERRALS ARE NOT SPREAD EQUALLY AMONG ALL DISTRICTS AND FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON DISTRICTS THAT RELY MORE HEAVILY ON THE STATE FOR THEIR FUNDING. THESE DISTRICTS ARE OFTEN ONES THAT SERVE MORE LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND HAVE LESS PROPERTY WEALTH. AND AS A RESULT THEY HAVE A FUNDING. AND THESE DISTRICTS IN THESE SITUATIONS OFTEN HAVE TO BORROW MORE MONEY IN ORDER TO MEET PAYROLL AND OTHER STUDENTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. SO RECOGNIZING THIS THESE INEQUITIES THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CRAFTED AN APPROACH THAT INSURED EACH DISTRICT RECEIVED AT LEAST 83% OF THEIR FUNDING FROM ALL SOURCES THIS INCLUDED PROPERTY TAXES AND ENROLLMENT FEES. WITH THIS EQUITY ADJUSTMENT ALL SOURCE THE FUNDING VERY VALUE WAITED AND LOWER WEALTH DISTRICTS DIDN'T HAVE TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF BARLEY. SO AND THIS HEALTH CAN CALL. HAVE PROVED TO BE CRITICAL THE STATE AGAINST COLD IT WE ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF WORKFORCE TRAINING AND WE REPRESENT A PATH TO PRIME. TO PROSPERITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY FOR ALL. OUR STUDENTS ARE MOTHERS VETERANS WORKING LEARNERS DREAMERS AND SO MUCH MORE THIS POPULATION CONSTITUTES THE CORE OF OUR WORKFORCE. THEY NEED US AND WE NEED THEM. THIS STORY THERE'S A STORY THAT RESONATES WITH ME ONE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR NEWEST COLLEGE MADERA. HEY LITTLE SCHOOL WHO'S A FAST. AND ARMY NATIONAL GUARD. IN HIS TIME TO THE SPRING HE WAS DEPLOYED TO ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE TO HELP WITH FOOD DISTRIBUTION AS PART OF THE EMERGENCY. AND THOUGH HE HAD AN INTERRUPTION TO HIS EDUCATION HE IS COMMITTED TO COMPLETING HIS WORKFORCE AND SERVING HIS COMMUNITY. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE WE TRAIN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FIRST RESPONDERS AND- THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT SO IF WE HAMSTRING CALIFORNIA'S MANY COLLEGES NOW. WE WON'T BE READY AND AVAILABLE TO TRAIN THE WORKFORCE AND BE THERE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION THIS NEXT YEAR AHEAD AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL KEEP IN MIND THE VALUE THAT WE BRING TO CALIFORNIA. AND THE STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE. THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS THANK YOU LOSE THAT AND NOW GO TO ALEX GRAVES. ALEX YOU MAY BEGIN. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS ALEX GRACE WITH THE ICC YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE. ON THE OVER EIGHTY INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE. FROM SIMPSON UNIVERSITY IN REDDING. YOUR P. U. S. AT USC AND MANY MORE UP AND DOWN THIS GREAT STATE. COLLECTIVELY OUR INSTITUTIONS AND ROLL JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES. ABOUT 20% OF THE UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION IN THE STATE- AND THREE QUARTERS GIVE OR TAKE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION ARE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. AT THE OUTSET OF KOBE NINETEEN IN THE SPRING. AT SCHOOLS MOVED SWIFTLY TO GET THEIR STUDENTS HOME SAFELY TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO FOR VARIOUS REASONS NEEDED TO REMAIN ON CAMPUS. AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS GOT THE LAPTOPS HOT SPOTS- TABLETS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT THEY NEEDED TO CONTINUE. THEIR STUDIES- WHILE ALSO SHIFTING STUDENT SERVICES TO AN ONLINE MODALITY. I'D LIKE TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON TRENDS WE SEE RELATING TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE INSTITUTIONS OF MADE IN RESPONSE TO THAT AND WHAT ROLE MEANT ARE INSTITUTIONS LIKE THIS ACADEMIC YEAR. SO THE IMMEDIATE AND ONGOING IMPACTS OF KOBE NINETEEN ON INSTITUTIONAL FINANCES HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT- THIS SPRING WE SURVEYED OUR CFO IS FINDING IMMEDIATE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS- JUST FOR ROOM AND BOARD- REFINANCE- AND ENCLOSURES- IN TERMS NOT COMPLETED. WITH THE MEDIAN AMOUNT BEING ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE SAW MEDIAN LOSSES IN REVENUE FROM SUMMER PROGRAMS AND FACILITY RENTALS IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. AROUND ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER INSTITUTION. AND JUST FOR CONTEXT- THE MEDIAN ENDOWMENT OF OUR INSTITUTIONS IS AROUND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS- THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS RESTRICTED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF THOSE WERE. SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACTS. INSTITUTE HAVE SEEN ADDITIONAL BUDGET CHALLENGES EMERGES THE PANDEMIC IS CONTINUED. AND WHILE WE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM AND DON'T HAVE COMPREHENSIVE DATA- WE DO SEE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES INSTANCES ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS LARGE AND SMALL. I AM A FOURTEEN DOLLAR A PROJECTED BUDGET SHORTFALL FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO FIFTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF AUBURN. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AT OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE AND TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AT HARVEY MUDD COLLEGE AMONG OTHERS. ADDITIONALLY SCHOOLS HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO INVEST IN NECESSARY TESTING- FACILITY UPGRADES AND OTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES. FOR EXAMPLE CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY IN ORANGE COUNTY HAS SPENT EXCESSIVE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON VARIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY UPGRADES. INCLUDING OVER ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR TESTING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR VENTILATION UPGRADES AND OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PROVIDE WASHABLE MASKS TO STUDENTS. SO OUR SCHOOLS MANAGING THIS- THEY ARE. DOING THEIR BEST TO MANAGE THESE BUDGET ISSUES AND COST- CHALLENGES. THREE THINGS LIKE HIRING AND SALARY FREEZES- CUTTING TRAVEL BUDGETS SALARIED OPTIONS FOR SENIOR LEADERSHIP. AND POSTPONING NONESSENTIAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATIONS. FURLOUGHS HAVE ALSO OCCURRED AND IN IMPLEMENTING THESE- UNIVERSITIES HAVE GENERALLY APPROACH THIS I WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF DOING SO IN A MANNER- THAT WILL BE THE LEAST DISRUPTIVE TO THE ACADEMIC- INSTRUCTION AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO STUDENTS AND LASTLY. SCHOOLS ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING TO SEE WHAT SHORT TERM FUNDRAISING THEY CAN DO- WHILE ALSO SEEING WHAT OTHER FLEXIBILITY AS THEY MAY HAVE. WITHIN THE UNRESTRICTED FINDS IT IN THEIR ENDOWMENTS. TURNING TO ENROLLMENT THIS FALL AICC YOU DID SURVEY OUR ADMISSION AND ENROLLMENT STAFF- TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT IMPACT HOPE IT HAS HAD ON THEIR ENROLLMENT. WE HAD FIFTY SIX INSTITUTIONS RESPOND WHO COLLECTIVELY EDUCATE 91% OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SO WE FEEL LIKE IT'S A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE SAMPLE WE ASKED TO COMPARE. TWENTY TWENTY AND ROMANCE- TO THE OUT OF TWENTY NINETEEN AMONG FIRST TIME FRESHMEN AMONG TRANSFER STUDENTS AND ALSO RETURNING STUDENTS. OVER THREE QUARTERS OF INSTITUTIONS REPORTED DECLINES IN HOUSTON AND RONIT AND FIRST IN THAT ROLE THAT OVERALL INSTITUTIONS SEEN IMMEDIATELY DECLINE AROUND SEVEN PERCENT. WITH DECREASES ACROSS ALL THREE STUDENT POPULATIONS INCLUDING 10% FOR NEW STUDENTS AND 6% FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS. WE ALSO ASKED ABOUT SUMMER MELT- AND THE RESPONSES THERE WERE FRANKLY. STAGGERING I'M NOT A SINGLE INSTITUTION RESPONDED- THAT THEIR SUMMER MELTED DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR OVER HALF OF INSTITUTIONS RESPONDED THAT SUMMER MELT SOMEWHAT HIGHER. BUT MORE CONCERNING WAS THE 25230% AND INSTITUTIONS WHO ESPONDED THAT SUMMER MELT WAS MORE THAN 30% HIGHER. THAN THE PRIOR YEAR. SCHOOLS ALSO REPLIED THAT DEFERRAL RATES WERE UP AND IN SOME CASES AT HISTORIC LEVELS NOT PREVIOUSLY SEEN AT THEIR INSTITUTION- ONE REPORTED THEY HAD FIVE TIMES AS MANY DEFERRALS AS THE PRIOR YEAR. AND ANOTHER REPORTED DEFERRAL RATES WERE UP 80% SO IN CLOSING AS I WRAP UP I JUST OFFER A FEW OBSERVATIONS A FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. FIRST COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO HAVE SOME POPULATION OF STUDENTS ON CAMPUS YOU KNOW FOR COURSES OR PROGRAMMES IT CAN'T BE FULLY ONLINE OR FOR STUDENTS WHO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN ON CAMPUS HOUSING- THE COST OF TESTING IS SIGNIFICANT. AT LEAST IN OUR EXPERIENCE SO FAR WE'RE GENERALLY TALKING SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A TEST. AND SO ANYTHING THAT STATE CAN DO TO HELP BRING THESE COSTS DOWN I WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED WELCOME BY INSTITUTIONS AND HELP FREE UP CRITICAL RESOURCES FOR OTHER MISSION CRITICAL PURPOSES. SECOND THE ENROLLMENT DECLINES THAT WE SEE AND NATIONAL REPORTING AND OUR OWN SURVEY DATA. INDICATE A MASSIVE DISRUPTION WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION ACROSS ALL TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS ABOUT IMMEDIATELY AND FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN THE PIPELINE TH THESE WILL CONTINUE TO BE FELT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AND CERTAINLY FOR OUR SECTOR I THE LOAN IT CERTAINLY RAISES SOME CONCERNS- REGARDING STATUTORY TARGETS FOR THE EIGHTEEN WHICH OF COURSE IS TIED TO THE- GRANT AWARD AMOUNT FOR OUR STUDENTS- WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. PROMOTING COLLEGE ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THE INSTITUTION- PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES ARE ALL OVER THIS STATE IN ANY GIVEN REGION- YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THE MAJORITY OF FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONSBEING PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES. WE HAVE THIRTY SIX IN THE LA REGION ALONE SEVEN ORANGE COUNTY. FLORIDA EMPIRE AND SIX IN SAN DIEGO THIS IS EXAMPLES. SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND HIGHER EDUCATION RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS AS IMPORTANT AS EVER- TO ENCOURAGE AND PROMOTE COLLEGE- FOR STUDENTS SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS COMMON FROM THE DASH. I I'M GONNA CRUSH TO ALEX IT'S MY AND THAT SOME OF THE SMALLER INDEPENDENT COLLEGES. AND UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE- SMALLER RESERVES HAVE BEEN GREATLY IMPACTED IS THERE ANY DANGER OF SEEING ANY OF THESE SMALLER PRIVATE COLLEGES HAVE ENDED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SAY RIGHT NOW GIVE IN JUST YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE AND THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THIS TUNNEL IS- CERTAINLY WE HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE VERY- SMALL ENDOWMENTS- AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RESOURCES TO DRAW FROM- AND I THINK YOU KNOW THEY ARE ALL. SEEKING TO- ASSESS WHAT OTHER OPTIONS THEY HAVE EITHER IN TERMS OF. LINES OF CREDIT OR OTHER YOU KNOW STOP GAP MEASURES- TO HELP BRIDGE THIS DIVIDE BUT CERTAINLY THE LONGER- THIS DISRUPTION CONTINUES- THE MORE. THEY HAVE WILL BE FOR SOME OF OUR SMALLER REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU ALEX. THIS MCCARTY. YES THANK YOU- I APOLOGIZE I MISSED THAT COMMUNITY CALLS MOST OF IT PRESENTATION SO YOU MAY WANNA WENT OVER THIS. AT LEAST THAT BUT IF YOU CAN GIVE US A SNAPSHOT IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IN ENROLLMENT- DROPPING. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF AN IDENTICAL. STORIES BUT THERE BEEN ANY SURVEYS FROM YOUR CAMPUSES ON WHAT THAT. THE TOP ISSUES ARE BECAUSE YOU KNOW USUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A RECESSION. PEOPLE GO BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE COMMUNICATIONS BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF. PANDEMIC. IN A LOT OF OUR WORKERS. YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH A OWN ISSUES WITH THEIR OWNFOR. THEY MAY HAVE KIDS AT HOME AS WELL AND THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR ONLINE. EDUCATION SO- WHAT TYPE OF. OF ANALYSIS DO WE HAVE IF ANY. SIX MONTHS LATER. YEAH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. ONE OF THE THINGS I SHARED IS THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE THAT HAVE BEEN THE MOST AFFECTED PERSONALLY BY THESE CAN DAMAGE. BECAUSE THEY STARTED THIS PANDEMIC. ALREADY WITH LOCAL RESOURCES LOW ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID SO DIDN'T HAVE THE SAFETY NETS. ANY JOB LOSSES CHANGES IN WAGES AFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SO WHAT WE SAW IN SPRING WAS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GENERALLY MAINTAIN ENROLLMENTS THROUGHOUT. THE SPRING SEMESTER WHILE WE WERE DOWN- JUST UNDER DAY INTO JAN FIFTEENTH WHAT WE DID INSTEAD WAS A SEND A STATEWIDE SURVEY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ONE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS. AND BASED ON THAT SAMPLE WE'RE SEEING THAT WE ARE DOWN ABOUT THAT MEANS IS THAT IN SOME OF THE EARLY ANALYSIS WE'RE SEEING THAT STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN WERE LIKELY MOST AFFECTED AND THAT STUDENTS MAY STILL BE ON OUR CAMPUSES BUT TAKING FEWER CLASSES. IT'S A WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THEM AS INDIVIDUALS IT'S GOING TO BE KEY AS WE MOVE FORWARD BOTH TO MAINTAIN OUR PIPELINE TO AT UC AND CSU OF TRANSFERS IN ACC YOU. BUT JUST GENERALLY TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE. A GENERATION OF STUDENTS. ARE YOU ARE YOU THAT IT'S THE OLD OLDER STUDENTS. IS YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE YOUNGER STUDENTS WHICH I MEASURE OF THE PERCENTAGE WISE THAT YOU KNOW FRESH OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL ARE SIMILAR TO THE CSU STUDENTS WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE THINKING HEY THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY DO MORE AND TAKE MORE UNIT SO ARE YOU FINDING SOME OF YOUR YOUNGER STUDENTS ARE NOT ONLY. STICKING OUT BUT ALSO. TAKING MORE UNITS AND- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TIME THAT THERE. AT HOME SENSUAL. WE'RE WE'RE VERY WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN DIGGING INTO OUR DATA WENT COME JANUARY WHEN WE HAVE ACTUAL NUMBERS- RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY WORKING ON SPECULATION BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED JUST ON SURVEY DATA. IS THAT IN SUMMER WE DID HAVE INCREASES IN ENROLLMENT SO THAT PLAYS INTO THIS CONCEPT THAT STUDENTS MAY HAVE BEEN NOT TAKING ADDITIONAL COURSES AS THEY PREPARED TO ENTER FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS MAKING UP COURSES. OF VARIOUS POSSIBLE SCENARIOS FOR FALL OF BECAUSE 40% OF OUR POPULATION IS ADULT LEARNERS ARE ASKED IF THEY HAVE DEPENDENTS THAT ALSO ARE BACK IN SCHOOL AND GYM CLASSES. WE BELIEVE THIS COULD HAVE ADDED ADDITIONAL PRESSURES ON THEIR OVERALL LIFE UP BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AGAIN AS MENTIONED WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN AND WILL ANALYZE ONCE WE GET FURTHER DATA ON FULL. TWENTY TWENTY COME JANUARY. OKAY THANK YOU. I THINK THAT KIND OF. DR THANK YOU AND WAS THAT YOU HAD A COMMENT- JUST A MOMENT AGO THAT I REALLY WANT TO DRILL INTO YOU SAID YOU NEED TO SUPPORT THEM AS INDIVIDUALS AND WHEN YOU SAID THAT THAT HAS ECHOES WITHIN HEALTH CARE FOR US TO THINK ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND OFTENTIMES THERE ARE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATION THAT ALLOW CERTAIN STUDENTS TO DO WELL OR TO PERFORM UNDER WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS THAT SINCE YOU REPRESENT TWO MILLION STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. IS WHAT ARE WE CURRENTLY DOING TO MEET THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES I REMEMBER ARAMBULA THAT QUESTION REALLY ROOTED AT. SUPPORTING OUR END OF IT THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. SO WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THIS YEAR HAS BEEN ON A ONE TIME BASIS. ESSENTIALLY PULLING FROM FUNDS IN ONE PLACE TO SUPPLEMENT WITH OTHERS AND WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONGOING COSTS THAT ARE UNMATCHED. BY EITHER CARES OR FEMA. AND SO ONE OF THE KEY PIECES THAT WE ASK FOR IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE MENTAL HEALTH. NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE HIGHLIGHTED IN MULTIPLE TOWN HALL SESSIONS BUT ALSO IN THEIR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PRIORITIES. THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR AN INVESTMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES POTENTIALLY FROM PROP SIXTY THREE. THIS IS THAT SOMETHING THE STATE HAS DONE IN THE PAST INVESTING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ON THEIR CAMPUSES OR CONNECTED TO THE CAMPUS ITSELF. THAT'S GOING TO BE KEY RIGHT NOW WHAT WE HAVE- A SERIES OF- MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED ONLINE VIRTUALLY. BUT WE ALSO HAVE CAMPUS IS OPEN FOR- CONNECTING THEM TO OF COURSE PLANNING BUT- TO REALLY GET AT THE ROOT OF THEIR PERSONAL NEEDS I GOT INVESTMENT PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE. I'D LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH IF I COULD TO VETERANS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UC'S IN CSU'S AND HOW THEY- TREAT OUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS- AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER LOUIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND- AND THANK YOU VICE CHANCELLOR NAVARETTE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND YOUR SENSITIVITY TO STUDENTS AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ENROLLMENT TRENDS AND- MENTAL HEALTH PROBABLY IMPACTS IS QUITE QUITE A BIT BUT THIS IS A BROADER ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE OF THE PANDEMIC AND- A TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION LEARNING IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHAT HAVE WE SEEN NOT JUST IN IN MATRICULATION AS FAR AS YOU KNOW RETURNING STUDENTS AND OUR PEOPLE- IN ROLLING AT THIS CAMPUS IS BUT TO. COURSE COMPLETION ITSELF BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL ENROLL IN A COURSE BUT PERHAPS DROP OUT- AT SOME OR DROP AWAY- AT SOME POINT IN TIME THAT THAT MAYBE WE LEARNED SOME LESSONS IN THE SPRING THAT THAT WE TOOK WITH US THIS FALL HOW WE'VE BEEN STRENGTHENING THIS BECAUSE- COMMITTEE COLLEGES PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN EVERY COUNTY- IN CORNER OF OUR STATE- IT IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THIS IN A GRANULAR WHY THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY GIVE. WE'VE LEARNED A VARIETY OF THINGS FROM SPRING ALONE AND AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT WE LEARNED FROM FALL. BUT ONE KEY PIECE IS THAT AS- WE SAW IN THE SPRING IS THAT. HOW QUICKLY WE TRANSITION. OF HOW FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTIVE FOR STAFF AND FACULTY WAR REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE IN BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN. OUR COURSE SUCCESS RATES WE GENERALLY THEY REMAIN PRETTY STABLE. WHAT WE ALSO OFFERED IS STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A AN EXCUSE WITHDRAW. IT'S SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO BE AVAILABLE TO DISTRICTS THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE IF A STUDENT EVER FACES AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS A PANDEMIC. HAVING THE WIDESPREAD KNOWLEDGE OF THIS AS A WAY TO NOT PENALIZE STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID. OR THEIR ACADEMIC- THEIR ACADEMIC PATHWAY HAS BEEN VERY KEY. THE OTHER IS- HOW MUCH WE NEED TO DIVERSIFY OUR ONLINE. SUPPORT AS A SYSTEM ARE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF VARIOUS AT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT CAN SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. THOSE HAVE BEEN KEY AND AGAIN WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELVE INTO THIS BECAUSE- WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP EVERY SINGLE STUDENT THAT COMES THROUGH OUR DOORS ENGAGED AND ON THE RIGHT PATHWAY. THANK THANK YOU MISS NAVARETTE FOR FOLLOWING STUDENTS- SUCCESS AND HOW IT'S IMPACTING THEM AND PARTICULARLY. FOR THEIR THE IMPACTS TO FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE- COST OF LIVING IN SO MANY OTHER EXPENSES THAT GO INTO THIS THAT COULD BE PLACED AT RISK BECAUSE OF. HOW DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING IT IS FOR STUDENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC TO- TO RESPOND IN AND BE. THE STUDENTS THAT THEY HAD INTENDED TO BE. I ALSO WANT TO HAVE. ASK ABOUT THE SENSITIVITY TO- THE LEGISLATURE IS- FUNDING. OF THE FIRST IN AND NOW SECOND YEARS. OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST EDENS AND HOW THAT IS IN. OR NOT BY A- DROP IN IN CLASS THAT THEY HAD AND TO TAKE AND I KNOW YOU SAID THAT THE NUMBERS ARE STAINED KIND OF STATIC- BUT NONETHELESS THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THIS DOES THAT PUT AT RISK. ANY OF THEIR FREE- OR YOU KNOW THE FEES THAT HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED. FOUR I BELIEVE YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THE RESOURCES ALLOCATED UNDER ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN. OUT WHICH WAS CHAMPIONED BY THE ASSEMBLY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE PROVIDED AND NOTED IT- THAT OUR STUDENTS NEEDED EMERGENCY AID. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE ALLOWED STUDENTS TO MAINTAIN AND THAT YOU KNOW FREE COLLEGE. AS LONG AS THEY STATED ROLE WE HAD EXEMPTIONS FOR STUDENTS. UNDER AB NINETEEN IF THEY HAD TO DROP BY ONE AND ALL THAT SO WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T REMOVE THEM FROM THAT PROGRAM. THE OTHER THING THAT WE DID IS THAT THOSE. THOSE DOLLARS AND THAT CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. WAS VERY INTENTIONALLY CRAFTED BY THE ASSEMBLY TO BE FLEXIBLE TO MEET THE NEEDS. OF A PROMISE PROGRAMS LOCALLY. WHAT THAT DID IS ALLOWED THOSE FUNDS TO ALSO BE USED FOR MORE. FRANCE FOR THOSE VERY SAME STUDENTS SO. THAT PLUGS ABILITY MADE IT POSSIBLE TO AGAIN MEET EMERGENCY. LAST MINUTE NEEDS THAT STUDENTS MAY HAVE HAD UNTIL. IT AYE I'LL TAKE THIS TIME TO THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING THAT POSSIBILITY. AND THANK YOU MISS NUMBER. RESTRICTING THANK YOU ALSO DOES ANOTHER CORE TO MR READ I'M JUST GETTING US OF HOW THE CALL ARE DOING WITH THE TO. AND IF THE FORTY TO SET YOU KNOW LINES CREDIT AND DIFFERENT FINANCIAL TO CHOOSE FROM HELP GET TO THIS YEAR AND HOW HOW THEY'RE DEALING WITH A FUNDING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO. AS MENTIONED- DEFERRALS ARE MUCH PREFERRED OPTION OVER BASE REDUCTIONS. SO THIS YEAR WE HAVE. AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF DEFERRALS. BUT WE THANKFULLY HAD SOME VEHICLES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE BOTH BY THE STATE THERE ARE NEW- TAX ANTICIPATION REVENUE NOTE- THAT ALLOWS COLLEGES. TO BORROW AT LOW COST RATES AND LEVERAGES THE STATE'S TRIPLE A RATING SO THAT'S ONE OPTION. YOU KNOW COLLEGES CAN ALSO USE THEIR RESERVES. AND LINES OF CREDIT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE VEHICLES THAT THEY USE TO GET PAST. THESE DEFERRALS. WHAT WE DID AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS ALSO LOOK AT ALL THE SOURCES OF FUNDS. THAT COLLEGE RECEIVES AND WHETHER THEY ARE IN A HIGHER WHILE. NOT AREA. HIGHER PROPERTY WEALTH AREA. WHERE DOES THEIR A LOWER PROPERTY AREA. BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE LOWER PER BOTH AREA. AND PASSED FOR. THEY'VE HAD TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF TO. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BLOW WARM BECAUSE THEY GET MORE ON STAY DOLLARS. SO WHAT WE DID MAKE SURE EVERY SINGLE. RECEIVED AT LEAST EIGHTY THREE PERCENT- OF THEIR TOTAL FUNDS FROM ALL SOURCES IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THESE HIGH LEVEL OF DEFERRALS. I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF HOW WE DID THAT. AND A BRIEF ON OUR METHODOLOGY. NO THAT'S GREAT THERE THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION MAKES LOT OF SENSE THANK YOU. NOT SEEN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON A THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR. POLICE BEEN SELLING GALLAGHER IF I COULD GO AHEAD. MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ONE I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR FROM THE FIRST PRESENTATION OR- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A BIG ADVOCATE OF SAY AND HOW DO WE KIND OF GET BACK TO IN PERSON LEARNING I THINK A LOT OF US WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN I'VE CERTAINLY HAD A LOT OF. A CONTACT MY OFFICE FROM STUDENTS- WANTING TO. YOU KNOW GET BACK IN THAT ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY THINK THEY GET THE MOST OUT OF THEIR- FOR THEIR EDUCATION AT THIS POINT IN TIME- DO ANY OF THE CAMPUSES WHERE WERE YOU UYS THAT- IN TERMS OF. ARE YOU MAKE ANY DETERMINATION YET AS TO WHAT YOU MIGHT DO IN THE SPRING. SEMESTERS WE MAYBE HAVE SOME HYBRID SYSTEM. I KNOW IT CHICO- FOR INSTANCE THEY THEY KIND OF STARTED A HYBRID. MODEL ON CAMPUS- THAT THERE WAS YOU KNOW AN OUTBREAK ASSOCIATED THAT IT WAS NOT SO MUCH DUE TO. WELL WASN'T DUE TO ON CAMPUS INSTRUCTION RATHER MORE STUDENT GATHERINGS OFF CAMPUS- THAT HAD OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THE CONCERN FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT YEAH DO WE HAVE. PLANS FOR OFFERING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR THE SPRING SEMESTER. SURE AT THIS IS ALEX GRAVES GOING TO THE IC LIKE TAKE FIRST CRACK AT THAT. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS- YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW CONDITIONS ARE THOSE DECISIONS HAVE LARGELY BEEN DRIVEN BY A COUNTY LEVEL CONDITIONS- WITHIN THE STATE'S FRAMEWORK AROUND SAY FREE OPENING- SO IN SOME AREAS FOR EXAMPLE AT SIMPSON UNIVERSITY IN REDDING- DID. LARGELY REPOPULATE WITH IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AT THE BEGINNING THIS FALL TERM- WHILE ALSO GIVING STUDENTS WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON PREFERRED TO STAY- IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT THAT OPTION- YOU KNOW OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SUCCESS WITH THAT- WE HAVE INSTITUTIONS IN THE CENTRAL COAST TO HAVE REPOPULATED- BUT CONVERSELY AND L. A. COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE THIRTY SIX INSTITUTIONS- THE COUNTY THERE HAS. IT LANDED SOME ADDITIONAL MEASURES THAT HAVE MADE- ANY KIND OF RE POPULATION BEYOND- THOSE FOR YOU KNOW PROGRAMS THAT CAN'T BE DONE VIRTUALLY LIKE STUDIO ARTS- HEALTH PROFESSIONS THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING- SO I THINK YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONS ARE TRYING TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS RIGHT NOW FRANKLY- TO GIVE AS MUCH NOTICE TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FOR THE SPRING- BUT I THINK MUCH OF THEIR CALCULUS AND THAT. IN THEIR SCENARIO PLANNING WILL BE. DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS LOCALLY. TO ADDRESS BRIEFLY. ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL HAVE. CHANCELLOR OF BYRON BREELAND LATER YOU CAN PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE. A DISTRICT BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A SERIES OF HIGH GRADE OPTIONS ACROSS OUR COLLEGES OF LOS YOU'RE STILL ONLINE WHERE A POSSIBLE TO BE ONLINE CERTAIN CTE CLASSES IN ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES HAVE GONE BACK AT A VERY LIMITED CAPACITY WHERE. OF VARIOUS SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TEMPERATURE TESTING PLEXI GLASS- IMPLEMENTED ALL THESE VARIOUS PERCUSSION BUT AGAIN THANK GOD WE CAN ONLY OFFER A VERY LIMITED CAPACITIES. FOR THE SAFETY OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF THE MEMBERS WHO MAY BE OUR REMOTE. NOT SEEN ANY AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR PROVIDING VERY- IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO US AND US WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA I WILL INTRODUCE THE SECOND PANEL. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. SO IT IN THE SECOND PANEL I'M GOING TO BRING UP THE PRESIDENT OF CSU SACRAMENTO. ROBERT NELSON HE B. HE WILL BE AND WITNESS VIEW IN ROOM ONE TWENTY SEVEN. I WILL ALSO INTRODUCE THE CHANCELLOR OF SAN JOSE EVERGREEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT IS VIRANT CLIFF BREELAND AND HE WILL BE AND WITNESS VIEW IN ROOM ONE TWENTY SIX. SO PRESIDENT NELSON IF YOU ARE THERE AND YOU'RE READY YOU CAN BEGIN WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT HOW SACRAMENTO STATE HAS RESPONDED TO THE PANDEMIC. AND KEPT OUR ACADEMIC MISSION STRONG IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES. IT HAS BEEN AND THEN. CHALLENGING NINE MONTHS BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN PROUDER AND MORE IMPRESSED. HI HOW ARE FACULTY AND STAFF AND STUDENTS HAVE REACTED THEY ARE MY HEROES. AS YOU KNOW IN MARCH THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY IMMEDIATELY SHIFTED TO A VIRTUAL OPERATIONS. IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT FUN. SOME COURSES CLEARLY COULD GO ONLINE OTHERS SUCH AS NURSING AND ENGINEERING PROVED TO BE MORE CHALLENGES. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES OUR STUDENTS ACADEMIC. CONTINUE TO INCREASE ONLY SEVENTY ONLY SEVENTY OF OUR THIRTY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS WITH GREW DURING THE SPRING SEMESTER. IN ALL MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS ENDED THE TERM ELIGIBLE TO GRADUATE I RECOGNIZE NUMBER. MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE HAS CONTINUED TO RISE IT IS NOW TWENTY ONE. POINT SEVEN PERCENT. AN INCREASE. FROM JUST EIGHT POINT GRADUATION RATE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN L. AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS HAS TRIPLED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE GRADUATION RATE FOR HISPANIC STUDENTS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED TO TWENTY ONE POINT 1% WHICH IS LESS THAN ONE PERCENTAGE POINT. FROM OUR UNIVERSITY RIGHT. THE RISING GRADUATION RATES AT JUST SACKED STATE HAS COLLECTIVELY SAVED OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. GETTING THROUGH THE SPRING SEMESTER WAS A CHALLENGE. THE DECISION FOR ALL C. S. USED TO GROW VIRTUAL IN MAY HAS HELPED SET STATE THE STAGE FOR A SUCCESSFUL FALL SEMESTER. AS I SAID EARLIER NOT ALL CLASSES CAN BE TAUGHT ONLINE. 5% OF OUR NINE THOUSAND COURSES ARE CURRENTLY BEING TAUGHT IN PERSON BECAUSE OF THE NEED FOR SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUCH AS MANIKINS FOR NURSES AND SPECTROMETERS FOR BIOLOGISTS. ONLY FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE IN OUR DORMS. WE USUALLY HAVE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THE DORMS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS IN THE DORMS ARE FORMER FOSTER STUDENTS AND TOO MANY OF THEM WERE HOMELESS STUDENTS. PREVIOUS TO THE PANDEMIC. TO HELP THE FACULTY CONVERT THEIR EXISTING COURSES INTO ONLINE OR BLENDED COURSES WE USE ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL CARES ACT DOLLARS TO CONDUCT SOME RETRAINING EFFORT THAT WE CALLED TEACHING ONLINE SUMMER CAMP. MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED FACULTY TOOK PART IN THESE THREE. WEIGHT TRAINING SESSIONS. THIS SUMMER EFFORTS WERE NOT ONLY TO HELP THE FACULTY SHARPEN THEIR SKILLS ON CAMPUS AND ZOOM. BUT ALSO THE TRAINING EMPHASIZED EMPATHY FOR THE STUDENTS ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND STRESSED THE NEED FOR CONSTANT COMMUNICATION. HOPING OUR FACULTY TO PREPARE TEACH ONLINE MEANS NOTHING IF WE'RE NOT ALSO DOING SOMETHING TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR OUR STUDENTS. SINCE MARCH THE UNIVERSITY HAS SPENT MORE THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON TECHNOLOGY EQUIVALENT. LOAN THOSE PURCHASES TO OUR STUDENTS. THIS INCLUDES. ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE LAPTOPS. ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR HOT SPOT. WHICH WE PAY FOR EACH MONTH. THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE WEBCAMS. AND WE'VE PARTNERED WITH COMCAST TO HELP OUR STUDENTS GET FREE BROADBAND. THESE TECHNOLOGIES INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO COST THE UNIVERSITY MORE THAN FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH MONTH FOR THE HOT SPOT SALONE. BUT OUR STUDENTS FIRST DECISIONS HAVE CLEARLY PAID OFF AS OUR MOMENT IS UP AND OUR STUDENTS ARE TAKING MORE UNITS THAN EVER. AS OF THIS MONTH WE HAVE. RECORD NUMBER. THIS IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MORE THAN LAST YEAR. THIS FALL WE BEGAN IMPLEMENTING OUR LARGEST RECORD SCHEDULING EFFORT TO DATE. WHAT WE CALL THE HORN AND LYFT. RATHER THAN ALLOWING STUDENTS TO CHOOSE COURSES RANDOMLY EACH STUDENT PROVIDED. IS PROVIDED WITH OF COURSE SCHEDULE THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. WE'RE NOT LAUNCH PROVIDES STUDENTS AT PRE DESIGN FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN UNIT FIRST SEMESTER COURSE SCHEDULE WHICH IS BASED ON THEIR MAJOR AND ON THEIR INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HORN AT LAUNCH WILL HELP STUDENTS START THEIR COLLEGE CAREERS ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AND KEEP THEM ENGAGED IN THE COURSES AND HELP THEM GRADUATE ON TIME. SO FAR THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN VERY IMPRESSIVE. AS OUR FRESHMEN AVERAGING UPLOAD IS FOURTEEN POINT FIVE AN ALL TIME HIGH. THIS IS AN INCREASE FROM TWELVE POINT SEVEN UNITS IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WE ARE WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO GRADUATING OUR STUDENTS IN FOUR YEARS. FIFTEEN UNITS TIMES TO TIMES FOUR EQUALS A HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS A DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS. WELL THE PANDEMIC IS CHANGE HOW WE TEACH AND HOW WE OPERATE. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IT CANNOT DISTRACT US FROM THE WORLD. THAT IS SURROUNDING US. TO THAT END WE ARE MOVING AGGRESSIVELY WITH AN ANTI RACISM INITIATIVE THAT I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF HAVE EMBRACED. SACRAMENTO STATE DOES NOT JUST CONDEMN RACISM WE'RE UNDERWAY DURING IN OUR COMMITMENT TO END. RACISM TO THAT END I HAVE ALSO PLEDGED TO INVEST IN SANDERS PROGRAMS AND OTHER AREAS THAT ARE DOING ANTI RACISM WORK ON OUR CAMPUS. I PLEDGE TO SUPPORT FACULTY IN BUILDING. ANTI RACIST CURRICULUM AND ANTI BASS PEDAGOGY. AND I PLEDGE TO PROVIDE TRAINING DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO LEARN ABOUT THE ACTIONS THAT THEY CAN TAKE TO FIGHT RACISM. WE'RE ALSO INCREASING OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CHANGE THE WAY. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE POLICED. WE WILL NOT STAY QUIET AS OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES EXPENSE EXPERIENCE IN JUSTICE AND RACISM. WE'RE COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THIS IMPERATIVE. IN CONCLUSION. I WANT JUNE IN ALL SACRAMENTO STATE CONTINUES TO BE. OUR UNIVERSITY ON THE RISE. AND OUR THAT OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF HAVE ABSOLUTELY RISEN TO THE OCCASION. I KNOW THAT MANY OF MY FELLOW SIX CSU CAMPUSES HAVE UNDERTAKEN SIMILAR EFFORTS AS S. AND I PLEDGE TO YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE STUDENT SUCCESS. HOWEVER I MUST REMIND YOU AND CAUTION YOU. THAT WE ARE AN UNPRECEDENTED FISCAL TIMES. WE'RE FACING STATE BUDGET CUTS ISING SPENCER'S AND REVENUE LOSSES. SINCE ACT SINCE MARCH SACRAMENTO STATE I HAVE EXPERIENCE. ALL THIRTY MILLION. REVENUE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR REVENUE LOSSES FROM CAMPUSES AND FROM CAMPUS AND EXHILARATING FOR EXAMPLE FIFTEEN MILLION FROM HOUSING SIX MILLION FROM PARKING SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION FROM FOOD SERVICES JUST TO NAME A FEW. WE ALSO EXPERIENCED AT TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION. DOLLAR CUT IN STATE GENERAL FUNDING OF OUR BUDGET. AND WE HAVE HAD TO SPEND FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION IN RELATE OVER THE EXPENSES. AND THERE WILL BE MORE OR THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THEREFORE WE HAD TO GO INTO OUR RESERVES. AND WE'VE USED SEVEN MILLION OF OUR CAMPUS RESERVES UP TO THIS POINT. THAT LEAVES US WITH ONLY ONE MONTH OF RESERVES. THAT WE CAN CALL ON. SO THINGS ARE TIGHT. BUT WE MUST CONTINUE THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE THEM WITH THESE CUTS. I KNOW MANY OF YOU PERSONALLY. AND I KNOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT OUR STUDENTS AND YOU WANTTO SEE THE BEST FOR THAT M. AS TO ALL OF US AT SAC STATE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME. FOR HELPING SEX STATE. AND THE CSU SYSTEM. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. STINGERS UP I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU AND WE'LL GO NOW TO CHANCELLOR BYRON CLIFF REALLY AND THEN WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS. AND HE ISN'T WITNESS VIEW IN ROOM. ONE TWENTY SIX. THAT GOOD AFTERNOON TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION- AND THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER TWO I WANT TO THANK GOD BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA- GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE WITH YOU ALL THIS AFTERNOON. AGAIN MY NAME IS BYRON GOOD FREELANCERS A CHANCE FOR THE SAN JOSE EVERGREEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WHICH IS COMPOSED OF SAN JOSE CITY COLLEGE EVERGREEN VALLEY COLLEGE. AND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE EXTENSION CENTER IN THE CITY OF MIL PAETUS AS WELL AS A CENTER FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE. SAN JOSE EVERGREEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IS LOCATED IN THE HEART OF SILICON VALLEY. WE SERVE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS EACH YEAR. AND HAVE THE DAHLE DISTINCTION OF BEING DESIGNATED AS BOTH A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION AS WELL AS AN AGENT SERVING INSTITUTION. IN SPITE OF THE COOPER WEALTH THAT EXIST IN THE VALLEY. WE ALSO BOTH PERHAPS ON THE LARGEST INCOME AND WEALTH GAPS IN THE WORLD AMONG PEOPLE LIVING AND WORKING IN THE LAND OF INNOVATION ON THE SILICON VALLEY. IN OUR DISTRICT THE MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE LOW INCOME. WITH APPROXIMATELY FEE WAIVER FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE GOVERNOR FEE WAIVER. OUR FULL TIME FACTOR ALSO KNOWN TO BE AMONG THE MOST DIVERSE IN THE NATION. BREAKING IN THE TOP FIVE NATIONALLY AMONG THE TOP TWELVE HUNDRED PLUS TO YOUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT. YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT IT PRESENTED MANY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM. AND AS OF YESTERDAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT WE REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH OF A HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND NU KOPEN NINETEEN CASES NATIONALLY. WITH NO END IN SIGHT IN TERMS OF THE U. S. GETTING A HANDLE ON THE OUTBREAK. HEADING INTO WHAT IS BEING TERMED THE DARK WINTER. AS SUCH I CHALLENGES TO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES WE WILL NEED US THE MOST- SHOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE OUR FULL ATTENTION. AND ESPECIALLY OUR COMMITMENT OF RESOURCE. S. CLARA COUNTY WITH ONE OF THE ORIGINAL HOT SPOTS IN TERMS OF THE FIRST MAJOR OUTBREAK OF CORPORATE NINETEEN IN THE U. S. S. J. E. C. C. D. WAS ONE OF THE FIRST DISTRICTS IN THE NATION TO MOVE TO REMOTE OPERATIONS AND INSTRUCTION. IN FACT A DIFFERENT WENT FROM HAVING APPROXIMATELY 15% OF OUR OFFERINGS AND DISTANCE EDUCATION. TO HAVING APPROXIMATELY 95% OF OUR OFFERINGS- IN IN THIS IS EDUCATION A MATTER OF DAYS. OSTENSIBLY THERE WERE CONTINUE TO BE MANY CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS WHO MUST REMAIN THE FOCAL POINT. OF OUR EFFORTS- AS WELL AS OUR SYSTEM WIDE EFFORT. LOCALLY AND ACCORDING TO AN INTERNAL SURVEY CONDUCTED IN OUR DISTRICT WE FOUND THAT OUR STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HIGH RATES. OF A LOSS OF INCOME FOOD SECURITY HOUSING INSECURITY AND INCREASED RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME. GIVEN THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE COMMUTERS. IN FACT ENROLLMENT NUMBER SEVENTY DECLINE IN OUR DISTRICT. ARE YEAR OVER YEAR ENROLLMENT IS DOWN 9% AND HEAD COUNT AND ALMOST 15% IN FULL TIME STUDENT ENROLLMENT WHEN COMPARING PAUL TWENTY NINETEEN TO FALL TWENTY TWENTY. I MISS THE BACKDROP OF PORT NATIONAL LEADERSHIP. POLITICAL POSTURING IN ONGOING RACIAL UNREST IN AND DAY OUT OF THE IMPACT ARE EXTREMELY DIVERSE STUDENTS AND STAFF. AS WELL AS THE REALITY THAT MANY STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAD LOST OR WERE IN DANGER OF LOSING THEIR JOBS. OUR DISTRICT LIKE MANY OTHERS IN THE STATE NEEDED TO BE COGNIZANT OF HOW THE DOWN ECONOMY DISPROPORTIONATE. INFECTION AND DEATH RATES HAVE A CONTINUE TO IMPACT LOW INCOME. LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN AND ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES. WE WILL NEED TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT FOR FRONT OF ANY WELL INTENDED ECONOMIC RECOVERY IF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO REGAIN ITS ECONOMIC FOOTING. NATIONALLY WE COMPARED TO FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONTINUE TO SUFFER THE MOST WITH THE DECREASE OF ABOUT NINE POINT 5% ENROLLMENT. WHICH IS ENROLLMENT DECLINED NEARLY NINE TIMES THE PRE PANDEMIC LAW FREE. HOWEVER I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT'S PERHAPS EVEN MORE CONCERNING. AND THAT IS THE NUMBER OF FIRST YEAR STUDENTS WHO ALSO DROP- MOST DRASTICALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT A RATE OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO POINT 7% I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ENROLLMENT EXPERTS AND ADVOCATES FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE SHARED THAT THESE STUDENTS TEND TO LIVE IN MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLDS. THAT DON'T ALLOW FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. THERE ARE CRITICAL REALITIES TO BE MINDFUL OF IF WE START TO THINK ABOUT DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING A STRONG AND EQUITABLE POST PANDEMIC RECOVERY FOR THE STATE'S ECONOMY. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT FINDING FROM OUR DISTRICT'S LOCAL SURVEYS HIGHLIGHTED THIS STUDENTS HAVE HAD TO REDUCE THEIR COURSE LOW. WITHDRAW COMPLETELY OR NOT RETURN TO SCHOOL OR CLASSES DUE TO THE IMPACT. OF COVERT NINETEEN ON THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO CIVICALLY WE FOUND THE STUDENTS WERE CHALLENGED WITH A LACK OF ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND COMPUTER HARDWARE. THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS OF STUDENTS. BECAME THE MOST SALIENT WHEN WE MADE THE SWITCH TO DISTANCE LEARNING. FOR EXAMPLE WE PURCHASED AND DISTRIBUTED ABOUT HUNDRED FIFTY WIFI HOTSPOTS THREE HUNDRED COMPUTER MONITORS AND ABOUT A HUNDRED WEBCAMS. OUR STUDENT SERVICES TEAMS OF ALSO CONTINUE PROVIDING ACCESS TO FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE MOST NEEDY STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE MADE THE CONVERSION TO A VIRTUAL CAMPUS PROVIDED DISTANCE EDUCATION TRAINING ESTABLISH A CAMPUS REOPENING PLAN. CONTINUE STREAMLINING IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDED PATHWAYS AND GAVE THE MEASURING CLASSROOM. ANTI RACISM CURRICULUM STUDENTS ALSO INDICATED THAT ACCESS TO THE FOLLOWING SERVICES WERE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FROM A REMOTE ENVIRONMENT ACADEMIC COUNSELING LIBRARY SERVICES FINANCIAL AID TUTORING WHICH WE KNOW ARE ALL KEY COMPONENTS TO STUDENT SUCCESS I ALSO WANT TO HEAR THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR STUDENTS REPORTED THAT PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THEY HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH TAKING ACADEMIC CLASSES ONLINE. ARE CHLOE'S ALSO WORK CHALLENGE IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT WITH A LITTLE OVER HALF OF OUR FACULTY STATING THAT THEY HAD NO EXPERIENCE TEACHING ONLINE PRIOR TO COPE. FAR STAFF WE'VE BEEN SURE TO PROVIDE REMOTE ACCESS FLEXIBLE HOURS REQUIP COMMUNICATION CLEAR SAFETY GUIDELINES. AN ONLINE EMPLOYEE TO KIDS THE COPA NINETY PANDEMIC OF RESULT IN IT ON. DISRUPTION TO OUR COLLEGE OPERATIONS AND THE LIVES OF OUR STUDENTS. AS A DISTRICT AS INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES IN THE SYSTEM WE HAVE WORKED HARD AND INVESTED THE NECESSARY RESOURCES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. FOOD AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TO OUR STUDENTS- WITH THE MOST NEED. I TO WRAP UP BY. SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE AN- BEFORE THE TWELVE NINETY OUTBREAK WAS A PAN PLAY AND I TO THANK I CHIEF POLICE AND EFFORT AND ARE. FOR MANAGING THE PROCESS AND IT WE ALL DISCOVERED MANY OF COLLEGE ALSO DID NOT SUCH A- AS WE ALL WERE MORE FOR. ON A SHOOTER EXERCISE OR WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF AN EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER NAY DISASTER AND NOT ANTICIPATING A PANDEMIC. BUT THE SPECIFIC PLAN OUTLINES A DURING A PANDEMIC THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES FACING THE DISTRICT WILL LIKELY BE MAINTAINING STUDENTS PROGRESS TO COMPLETE CLASS REQUIREMENTS WHILE COMPLYING WITH ORDERS TO CLOSE THE CAMPUS. MANAGING AND LIMITING FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENT EXPOSURE BOTH ON AND OFF CAMPUS. COMPLYING WITH LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES. LOSS OF REVENUE DUE TO THE INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO OFFER COURSES AND OR STUDENT ILLNESS. THE PURPOSE OF THE DISTRICT COURT NINETEEN PANDEMIC PLAN IS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN PREPARING FOR IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDED TO COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS THAT AFFECT THE SALE OF THE EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. BY LIMITING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS AND MINIMIZING SOCIAL DISRUPTION WITHIN A COMMUNITY IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT IS HIGHLY COORDINATED. WITH LOCAL COUNTY AGENCIES. THE CRITICAL FOR OF EMPLOYMENT IS A OF STAFF AND TO FULL STRUCK. OR SOME TYPE OF HIGH BOB. THIS IS LEARNING PROTOCOL MAKE. HOWEVER PREPARATIONS MUST BE TAKEN TO ASSUME THAT MOST FACILITIES WILL RESUME TO BEING OCCUPIED. HERE IS TO BE CONSIDERED ARE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN A CLASS. BASED ON STUDENT POPULATION AND INTERNAL BUILDING SQUARE FOOTAGE. ONGOING CONCERNS OF NOTE INCLUDE OUR ABILITY TO HAVE A ROBUST CONTACT TRACING PROGRAM IN PLACE. AS WELL AS ACCESS TO COPE WITH TESTING FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS WHICH WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE- AND I'VE HEARD THE UC AND C. ISSUE A SEGMENT TALK ABOUT SOME OF THAT. I IN THEIR PLANS AS WELL. AB ANY PARTICULAR AS WE ARE CONSIDERING RESUMING ATHLETIC COMPETITION IN THE SPRING. THESE THINGS OF COURSE AT ADDITIONAL COST TO OUR BUDGETS. OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE SEEN DECLINES IN REVENUE. AS A RESULT THE ONLY WARM REMOTE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT INCLUDE OUR ENTERPRISE SERVICES SUCH AS THE BOOKSTORE AND CAFETERIA. AND OF COURSE OUR PARKING SPOT. THE IMPACT OF OVER NINETY OPPOSED. EDUCATION HAS BEEN ACROSS GLOBE. AND CERTAINLY IN THE FANTASQUE STATED. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND I WANT TO THANK THE JOINT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THESE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT BRIEFLY IMPACTED OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS EFFORTS. AS WELL AS THEIR ECONOMIC MOBILITY. AND NOT TO MENTION THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO SERVING. WE ALMOST PRIORITIZE HIGHER EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE BEST PATHWAYS TO ECONOMIC MOBILITY. AND IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR NATION'S RECOVERY. WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEING AT THE CENTER OF THESE EFFORTS. GIVEN THE OPEN ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY THAT WE PROVIDE TO ALL COMMUNITIES. BEING ABLE TO PUT ADDITIONAL RELIEF FUNDS TO USE WILL HAVE A HUGE. IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS ABILITY TO. IT THE PURSUIT OF THEIR- CERTIFICATES ENTRANCE GOALS DURING THE CHALLENGING TIMES. ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE EVERY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN OUR BORDER. I WANT THIS YEAR THANK ASSEMBLY COME HIGHER. IN THE ASSEMBLY BUT SUB COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TIME AND EFFORT TOWARDS IS ONGOING CHALLENGES FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHEN LANE AND WE WILL NOW OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS. MR MCCARTY YES I REALLY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION A WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF RUNNING SHORT ON TIME I JUST WANT TO GIVE. A PROPS TO MY LOCAL CSU PRESIDENT AT SAC STATE PRESIDENT NELSON IS IN A TREMENDOUS JOB. AS FAR AS PUSHING THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND JUST THAT FIGURE THAT HE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH WE'RE SAVING FAMILIES. IN IN MONEY AND STUDENT DEBT THAT THEY DON'T TO. IS JUST A TOTAL WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA AGAIN FREES UP SPACE SO I KNOW- RAINSTORM EARLIER WE'VE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. BUT I NEED I THINK WE OF COURSE HE DIDN'T LOOK AND SEE WE CAN DO TO RELICATE THIS ALL ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE. CAPAS SYSTEM THANK YOU. SURE RUMBLING DR ROOM ALL FOLLOW UP ON IF I CAN I THOUGHT A NELSON GAVE SOME SUGGEST THAT I INSTITUTION MAY WANT TO LOOK AT AND SO I JUST WANTED TO REPEAT THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT I GOT THEM RIGHT PRESIDENT NELSON IT SEEMS THAT YOU WERE FOCUSED ON STUDENT FIRST DECISIONS AND FOR YOU TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT THE TWO TOP THINGS YOU WORKED ON OR EMPATHY FOR ONLINE STUDENTS. AS WELL AS BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND WANTED TO HEAR IF YOU THOUGHT THOSE WERE TWO OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT YOU EMPLOYED AT SACRAMENTO STATE OR IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER OTHERS THAT YOU THOUGHT SHOULD BE PRIORITISED AHEAD OF THOSE. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS A RE. IT IS A REAL AND WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. WE THE PARKING GARAGE NUMBER FIVE. WHICH IS ONE BAY HOT SPOT. AND WE OUR STUDENTS ARE INTO. AND WORKING IN THEIR- SO THEY THEY CAN HAVE SPACE THERE. OFTEN THERE THERE WITH THE RUDE LITTLE KID IN LITTLE KIDS ARE ON THEIR BIKES RIDING AROUND IN THE PARKING GARAGE WHILE MOM IS WORKING. SO YOU HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GIVE THE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY MOSTLY YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN THEM. WHEN WE MADE THIS CHANGE IT WAS A HARD CHANGE. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR STUDENTS AND YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR FACULTY AND YOU GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY WILL SUCCEED. THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUESTION TO A CHANCER BREELAND. WHAT OTHER SUPPORT- WOULD YOU LOOK FOR OF THE LEGISLATURE DURING THIS TIME TO HELP THE NEEDS OF- OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. BUT THIS DID YEAH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER YEAH- I THINK YOU HEAR ME NOW YES SOUNDCHECK YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE CALL AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SUPPORT IN A NUMBER OF AREAS I THINK OF MENTAL HEALTH WAS ALREADY MENTIONED- MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING- WE'RE CERTAINLY- UNDERFUNDED WHEN IT COMES TO BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON OUR OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES- IT FOR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT I THINK IN THIS ENVIRONMENT TO BE CREATED UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY- TO BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY A LACK OF STAFF THERE- WE'RE ALSO CONTINUING TO HAVE TO FIND- THE TRANSITION- IN THIS NEW- ENVIRONMENT- I THINK MOVING FORWARD WE ARE GOING TO BE- I MENTIONED EARLIER WE TRANSITION FROM 15% ONLINE TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT. ONLINE IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO WE'RE GONNA NEED FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING- FUNDING- AND THAT IS OF OUR FACULTY AND OUR STAFF WHO ARE NOW BEING ASKED TO A FUNCTION AT A HIGH LEVEL IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. AND OF COURSE SUPPORT FOR OUR STUDENTS WE'VE HEARD THE DIGITAL DIVIDE EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC IS CERTAINLY POST PANDEMIC THAT DIVIDE IS INCREASED- WE TO HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET. IN OUR OF PARKING LOTS WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT BUT WE'RE ALSO SEVERELY LACKING OR SORELY LACKING ACCESS TO INTERNET AS FAR AS A HT SPOT OR EVEN LAPTOPS AND COMPUTERS ALTOGETHER THESE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES- WHEN- BACKDROP AGAINST OPERA NORMAL OPERATIONAL- COST- WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE LONG TERM- IN MAKING CHANGES I THINK A LOT OF A ONE TIME DOLLARS A NEED- IN ORDER TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS ARE TRAINING EFFORTS- AS WELL AS THE ONGOING NEED FOR PP ANY- AND ONE THING I'LL ADD- THAT WE DO NEED. TO START IMPLEMENTING IT START TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT CONTACT TRACING- AS WELL AS TESTING- ON A REGULAR BASIS- OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FACULTY AND STAFF- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN FUNDED FOR- AND IF SOMETHING IS GONNA BE IMPORTANT MOVING. FORWARD INTEL A VACCINE. I HAS BEEN THE- INTO COURSE JUST TO EVER. AND IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WE SERVE WE- THAT MAY TAKE UPWARDS OF TWO YEARS. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT WE DO HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER DATA. THANK YOU CHANCE. AND THEN TO PRESIDENT NELSON. I'VE HEARD A LOT DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THAT WE ARE ASKING. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO DO MORE WITH LESS. SO TO PRESIDENT JOHNSON WHERE. HOW CAN WE GET. TO THE PLACE WHERE WE UNDERSTAND THAT LESS IS LESS. AND THAT WE NEED TO BEGIN TO PRIORITIZE- OUR PRIORITIES. PRESIDENT NELSON. I HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG ON OUR CAMPUS THAT WE MUST DO LESS WITH LESS. WE CANNOT ASK MORE OF OUR FACULTY. THEY ARE WORKING HARD RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THEM AS THEY'RE APPROACHING THE END OF THE SEMESTER ARE BURNING OUT. WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM AT EVERY CABINET MEETING THAT I HAVE WE BEGIN BY DISCUSSING WHAT ARE WE NOT GOING TO DO. NOW WE WILL ALSO ASK OURSELVES WHAT ARE WE NOT GOING TO DO THAT WILL NOT HAVE ANY HARM TO OUR STUDENTS. SO WE LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR SUCCESS. WE SPENT FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON EXTRA SECTIONS THIS SEMESTER SO THAT WE CAN KEEP OUR GRADUATION RATES MOVING FORWARD. THAT IS ESSENTIAL WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IS A CENTRAL. I'VE ASKED MY CABINET AND OTHERS TO CUT THEIR LITTLE DARLINGS LITTLE DARLINGS IS A PHRASE FROM HEMMING WAY AND ONE HEMINGWAY WITH A HE SAID IF IT. WAS SOMETHING THAT HE LOVED IT PROBABLY WASN'T SOMETHING THAT HE REALLY NEEDED. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS TO BE ABLE TO. IN SHORT THERE EVERYONE IS STILL MOVING FORWARD BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT NORSTAR THAT RYAN STORM TALKED ABOUT. OF HELP. AND THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. RENDON ANNOUNCED AND I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ASK ANY OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WEATHERBY K. TWELVE OR HIGHER ED TO DO MORE WITH LESS SO I LIKE THAT YOUR CONCEPT OF DOING LESS WITH LESS SO THANK YOU AND I BEFORE I. I'D ASK THEM TO GO ON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO ONE. OUT THERE- ANY OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO ARE WATCHING THE REMOTELY WHO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SO NOT SEEN ANY BY I THANK THE TWO PANELISTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND SHARING YOUR WISDOM WITH THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT I WILL BRING UP NOW- GINGER CLARK. PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL EDUCATION THE ROGERS SCHOOL OF EDUCATION ASSOCIATE VICE PROVOST FOR ACADEMIC AND FACULTY AFFAIRS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SHE IS FROM THE LOS ANGELES REMOTE ACCESS STATION. A PROFESSOR CLARK THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US. YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I'M I'M REPRESENTING U. S. C. AS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT UNIVERSITIES AND I WEAR A FEW DIFFERENT HATS AT USC AS YOU'VE MENTIONED I AM I AM FACULTY IN THE ROSSIER SCHOOL I TEACH IN THE MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY PROGRAM THERE I'M AN ASSOCIATE VICE PROVOST FOR ACADEMIC AND FACULTY AFFAIRS WHERE I DEAL WITH. ISSUES RELATED TO OUR PART TIME AND FULL TIME TEACHING TRACK RESEARCH TRACK PRACTITIONER TRACK AND CLINICAL TRACK FACULTY AND THESE ARE ALL OF OUR FACULTY WHO ARE NOT ON THE TENURE TRACK. I'VE ALSO BEEN LEADING USC'S TEACHING EXCELLENCE INITIATIVE AND FINALLY I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING. SO TO GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT OF USC'S CONTEXT USC HAS ABOUT FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE UNDERGRADUATE AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE GRADUATE. ABOUT TEN THOUSAND OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE REPRESENTING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE VISA AND TIMES ON CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN ENCOUNTERING IN TERMS OF THE SHIFT TO ONLINE EDUCATION. SO IN TRYING TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS ARE LEARNING DURING THE COVERED AREA WE CREATED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INCLUSIVE PRACTICES TO ADDRESS OME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS ARE FACING. THE FIRST WAS A POLICY TO RECORD ALL CLASS SESSIONS AND MAKE THOSE AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS IN THE CLASS. AND THAT WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS TIMEZONE ISSUES- ISSUES WITH CARE GIVING OR HOME ENVIRONMENT LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. OR ILLNESS. WE ALSO OFFERED ACCOMMODATIONS FOR EXAMS PARTICULARLY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS SO THAT STUDENTS COULD TAKE EXAMS OR ASSESSMENTS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF. SEVEN AM AND TEN PM AND THEIR LOCAL TIME ZONES. WE OFFERED LAPTOP LOANER PROGRAMS HOT SPOT PROGRAMS MANY OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN SOME OF OUR OUR- COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE. WE ALSO OFFERED HOUSING FOR SOME OF OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE CHALLENGING LIVING AND LEARNING CONDITIONS. AND WE OFFERED CLASS ACCOMMODATIONS AROUND THINGS LIKE THE CAMERA ON POLICY WE ASKED FACULTY THAT IF THEY WERE GOING TO REQUIRE STUDENTS TO HAVE THEIR CAMERAS ON THAT THEY WOULD MAKE COMMENDATIONS FOR STUDENTS WHO HAD ISSUES THAT MADE THAT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM. WE ASKED FACULTY AS AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED TO BE EMPATHETIC AND TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH THEIR STUDENTS PROVIDING ASSIGNMENT EXTENSIONS IF NECESSARY DURING THE CRISIS. THE UNIVERSITY ALSO HELD MULTIPLE EVENTS TO ADDRESS RACISM AS IT PLAYS OUT IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC PERIOD. AND R. USC CENTER FOR RACE AND EQUITY HELD TRAINING FOR FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS ON ANTI RACIST PRACTICES. TO GIVE YOU A PICTURE OF OUR FACULTY WE HAVE SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED FULL AND PART TIME FACULTY. ABOUT FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED OF THOSE REGULARLY SPEND TIME IN THE CLASSROOM AND THE RESTER RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS. OF OUR TEACHING FACULTY ABOUT A THOUSAND ALREADY REGULARLY TEACH IN OUR ONLINE PROGRAMS. WHEREAS THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED OR SO TEACH PRIMARILY ON GROUND. USC HAS OVER A HUNDRED ONLINE CERTIFICATES AND PROGRAMS PRIMARILY IN OUR MASTERS IN PROFESSIONAL DOCTORAL DEGREES AND VITERBI SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING HAS THAT ONLINE PROGRAM SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. SO ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR FACULTY WERE ALREADY PREPARED TO TEACH ONLINE WHEN COVERT HIT. BUT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE OTHER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. I'M ACTUALLY PART OF THAT 75% I TAUGHT A CLASS ONLINE FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SUMMER. AND I CAN TELL YOU IT TOOK ME ABOUT THREE TO FOUR TIMES AS LONG TO PREPARE FOR THAT CLASS THEM FOR MY ON GROUND CLASS. EVERYTHING WHEN YOU TEACH ONLINE HAS TO BE VERY ORGANIZED AND PREPARED AND PRE PACKAGED. SYNCHRONIZER LIFECLASS SESSIONS SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF STUDENTS IN THE COURSE MATERIAL THINGS LIKE. GUIDED DISCUSSIONS WERE GROUP WORKER CASE REVIEWS. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT INCREASES LEARNING AND KEEP STUDENTS ENGAGED AND IT PREVENTS THE ZOOM FIFTY. LECTURE SHOULD BE RECORDED AND VIEWED BEFORE CLASS IN SMALLER CHUNKS. FOLLOWED BY AN ACTIVITY WHERE STUDENTS ARE ACTIVELY APPLYING WHAT THEY'VE JUST HEARD TO HELP MAKE THE MATERIAL STICKIER AND TO HELP THEM REALLY LEARN IT WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO MAKE MULTIPLE RECORDED MANY LECTURES AND CREATE MULTIPLE SMALL ASSIGNMENTS TO FOLLOW THOSE LECTURES TO BE VIEWED ASYNCHRONOUSLY OUTSIDE OF CLASS TIME. ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS GRADING CRITERIA ALL OF THAT HAS TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR BECAUSE STUDENTS DON'TGET THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO GET CLARIFICATION FROM YOU AS A FACULTY MEMBER AS THEY WOULD IN AN ONLINE OR ON GROUND COURSE. SO THIS REQUIRED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK. AND IT USUALLY TAKES MONTHS TO TRANSLATE AN ON GROUND COURSE TO AN ONLINE COURSE. AND FACULTY EVERYWHERE HAD TO DO IT IMMEDIATELY. OUR FACULTY STUDENTS AND STAFF REALLY ROSE TO THE OCCASION AND I KNOW THAT OUR STATE AND INDEPENDENT COLLEGE COLLEAGUES TO THE SAME. THEY DESERVE SO MUCH CREDIT FOR THE AMOUNT OF WORK AND EFFORT THEY'VE PUT IN TO ENSURE A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION DURING THIS CRISIS. UNIVERSITIES HAVE HAD TO ACT QUICKLY TO SUPPORT FACULTY IN MAKING THIS CHANGE A U. S. C. WE PROVIDED FACULTY AND STAFF STIPENDS TO HELP OFFSET INTERNET COSTS. WE CREATED A WEBSITE WITH RESOURCES TO HELP FACULTY. USER LMS WHICH WAS BLACKBOARD FOR US. TO PUTS THEIR COURSE MATERIALS IN THEIR ASSIGNMENTS. TO TEACH THEM HOW TO USE THEM FOR HOLDING LIVE CLASS SESSIONS AND MEETINGS AND TO UNDERSTAND EVIDENCE BASED ONLINE TEACHING PRACTICES. WE CREATED WORKSHOPS RANGING FROM THE BASICS OF USING BLACKBOARD AND ZOOM. TO USING MORE ADVANCED SCHOOLS TO ALLOW FOR MORE DYNAMIC AND FLEXIBLE TEACHING. WE CREATED A SIX WEEK TRAINING INTENSIVE TO PROVIDE SOUP TO NUTS GUIDANCE ON GETTING COURSES ONLINE AND PROMOTING HIGH QUALITY ONLINE INSTRUCTION. WE USED TO CALL COURT MODEL IN THAT INTENSIVE PROMOTING FACULTY COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE SO THAT FACULTY COULD MENTOR AND LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER. AND TO HELP THEM PREPARE FOR THEIR SUMMER AND FALL CLASSES. AND WE CREATED A SELF STUDY VERSION OF THAT INTENSIVE. ODD TO HOPE TO ALLOW FACULTY WHO COULDN'T MAKE IT TO THE IN PERSON TRAINING TO DO THE SELF STUDY ON THEIR OWN. FACULTY WERE VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. IN A TYPICAL YEAR OUR CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING MIGHT TRAIN A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FACULTY SINCE MARCH OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FACULTY HAVE ATTENDED WORKSHOPS CLOSE TO A THOUSAND PARTICIPATED IN THAT SIX WEEK LONG INTENSIVE I MENTIONED. AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED VIEWS THE ASYNCHRONOUS SELF STUDY VERSION OF THE INTENSIVE MATERIALS. WE'VE BEEN MONITORING OUR PROGRESS AS WELL SERVING STUDENTS AND FACULTY THREE TIMES SINCE MARCH. ASKING WHAT SUPPORT SERVICES LEARNING TOOLS ARE WORKING WELL AND WHAT ARE THEIR EVOLVING NEEDS FOR SUPPORT. THE CHALLENGES WE FACED OBVIOUSLY WITH THE TIME FRAME THAT WE HAD IN WHICH TO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT WAS A BIG CHALLENGE. THE DIFFERENTIAL AND FAMILIARITY AND COMFORT LEVEL OF BOTH FACULTY AND STAFF AND STUDENTS IN ONLINE TEACHING AND LEARNING. A SMALL NUMBER HAVE NEVER HAD NEVER LOGGED INTO OUR LMS AND SO WE HAD FOLKS WHO WERE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH TECHNOLOGY AND WE HAD FOLKS WHO REALLY HAD TO PROVIDE MUCH MORE INTENSIVE SUPPORT TO HELP THEM GET COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. WITH THOSE TOOLS. AND THEN THE THIRD CHALLENGE WAS CREATING SUPPORT RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FACULTY AND STUDENTS IMMEDIATELY AS THOSE THOSE NEEDS EMERGED. THE POSITIVES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THIS FOR US HAS BEEN A RENEWED FOCUS ON TEACHING. THERE'S BEEN AN UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON OUR COURSES AND TO AND ARE TEACHING STRATEGIES. WHEN WE LOOK AT TEACHING OUR COURSES IN A DIFFERENT WAY IT REALLY FORCES US TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT KINDS OF STRATEGIES ARE USING. AND HAVE THOSE BEEN EFFECTIVE AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO US ONLINE SOMETIMES THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO IT THAN THE WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS. IT'S ALSO GIVING FACULTY A CHANCE TO REVIEW. BEST TEACHING PRACTICES. AND TO GET MORE EXPOSURE TO ONLINE LEARNING TOOLS. A BIG TAKE AWAYS FROM THIS AND I'M SURE THAT THESE ARE HAPPENING- AT OUR STATE AND- INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION COLLEAGUES AS WELL. IS IT FACULTY AND STUDENTS ARE VERY ENGAGED STAFF FOR SUPPORTING THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON AND LEARNING ONLINE IS WORKING. FACULTY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SUPPORT FOR THEIR TEACHING WHEN IT HAS VALUE. WHEN IT MEETS THEIR NEEDS AND WHEN IT'S OFFERED THROUGH MULTIPLE MODES IN ORDER TO FIT THEIR VARYING SCHEDULES. AND FINALLY THE FLEXIBILITY THE ONLINE TEACHING TOOLS PROVIDE ALLOW FACULTY MORE CHOICES TO HELP STUDENTS LEARN SO THE MORE WE CAN SUPPORT THOSE TOOLS THE BETTER. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU DR CLARK. QUESTIONS REGARDING. I DO HAVE A QUESTION I WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. WITH A DOG FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS I SPENT- IN THE CLASSROOM TEACHING IN THE CLASSROOM I'VE NEVER ONCE. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OR OR NEED TO DO ONLINE TEACHING BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT TEACHING IN THE CLASSROOM IS THAT YOU SEE THE STUDENTS IN FRONT OF YOU. AND YOU CA WHEN THEY'RE GETTING SOMETHING WHEN THEY'RE CATCHING ON AND WHEN THEY'RE NOT. I THINK STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM ALSO. PROBABLY AS OPPOSED TO ONLINE- FEEL FREER YOU KNOW THE RAZOR AND- ASK A QUESTION A- TEACHER THE PROFESSOR BALANCES DISCUSSION. OF MAKING SURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE HESITANT TO SPEAK UP. TO SPEAK UP. I'VE I'VE HEARD A LOT OF THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW CAN'T OR DON'T HAPPEN ONLINE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A- ONLINE DISCUSSION- YOU KNOW TEACH A PROFESSOR AT INTERACTING WITH STUDENTS WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN PROFESSORS AND TEACHERS DUE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE A QUESTION OR THE STUDENT WHO'S HESITANT TO PARTICIPATE ESPECIALLY ONLINE DOES AND I WOULD THINK THAT YOU KNOW FIRST GENERATION A LOWER INCOME A STUDENTS MAY. MAY BE IN THAT AREA MORE THAN THAN OTHER STUDENTS. THAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I COME FROM A FAMILY OF TEACHERS MY SISTER AND BROTHER IN LAW ARE TEACHERS AND WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN. IN ONLINE TEACHING AND THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT OUR FACULTY HAVE TALKED ABOUT AS WELL. IS HOW DO I GET HOW DO I GET A GAUGE FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY CLASSROOM AND IT. IT IS A BIT LIKE LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE YOU DO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO LOOK FOR THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU WOULD IN PERSON. WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE INTERACTING WITH STUDENTS ONLINE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU CAN BE MORE AND ARE ACTIVE WITH YOUR STUDENTS YOU CAN YOU CAN. ORGANIZER CLASS SO THAT THERE ARE MORE CHECK INS WITH STUDENTS- AND FRANKLY I'VE HAD FACULTY TELL ME AND I'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE AS WELL. USING THINGS LIKE CHAT FEATURES. OR BREAKOUT ROOMS CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE LESS IN IN PERSON CLASSES. AS IT ALLOWS THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN A WAY THAT MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE BECAUSE IT FEELS A LITTLE LESS INTIMIDATING TO GET ON A CHAT AND RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO SAY IT- VERBALLY AND SO. THAT'S SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR FACULTY IS TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO CONNECT WITH THEIR STUDENTS. AND FIND WAYS TO ALLOW THEIR STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN THE CLASS THAT MAYBE IS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL ONLINE INSTRUCTION. CHAU FROM HOW YOUR DISK. IT THE TEACHING. AT USC YOU YOU YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T THINK ANY. ANY ANYTHING HAS REALLY BEEN LOST- IN SHIFTING TO. TO ONLINE EDUCATION. AS FAR AS LEARNING. WELL I THINK THE TRACK. I THINK THE TRANSITION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE- BUT WE ARE HEARING FROM FACULTY THAT THEY'VE- THEY'VE FOUND NEW TOOLS OR NEW WAYS OF DOING THINGS THAT. THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OF BEFORE SO WHILE THE TRANSITION WAS DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE I THINK AND YOU KNOW I THINK FOR ALL OF US WE WERE IN A BIT OF. DENIAL FOR AWHILE HOPING THIS WOULD ALL JUST GO QUICKLY AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO DO IT FOR A FEW WEEKS. OVERTIME IS THE REALITY SET IN WE SORT OF DUGGAR HEELS IN AND TRIED TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS WORK WELL AND I THINK OUR FACULTY IN AND IT SOUNDS pHAVE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE REACHING THEIR STUDENTS AND THAT EFFECTIVE WAY. AND MY LAST QUESTION DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL BE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED. DURING THIS PANDEMIC USING DISTANCE LEARNING THAT WILL- CONTINUED AFTER THE PANDEMIC. IN THE WAY WE TEACH THE WAY WE INTERACT WITH OUR STUDENTS. ABSOLUTELY I'VE- I THINK- YOU KNOW AS I SAID BEFORE THE FACULTY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERING WAYS TO CONNECT WITH THEIR STUDENTS ONLINE THAT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ON GROUND. BUT THERE'S NO REASON THAT THEY COULDN'T CONTINUE TO USE SOME OF THESE ONLINE TOOLS EVEN WHEN THEY GO BACK TO FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION. SO FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW ALLOWING- DOING POLLING DURING CLASS. CAN SOMETIMES GET A GAUGE OF WHETHER STUDENTS ARE ARE ACCESSING MATERIAL ARE UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL LIVE SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT IN YOUR INSTRUCTION IN THAT MOMENT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF FACULTY HAVEN'T HAD ACCESS TO BUT AFTER HAVING ACCESS TO IT THROUGH THEM. THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE IN FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION AS WELL SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN CAPITALIZE ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED NOW. BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOT SEEN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I THANK YOU DR CLARK FOR SHARING WITH US- THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AND WITH THAT I WILL NOW GO TO THE STUDENTS. OF THE FIRST STUDENT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT SENATE FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUFF AND COULD DOOR AND HE WILL BE FOR A WITNESS VIEWING ROOM ONE TWENTY SIX. SECONDS STUDENT IS EIGHT IN. PARIS AUSTIN HAVE PRESIDENT OF THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND HE IS IN WITNESS VIA IN ROOM ONE TWENTY SEVEN STEPHAN IF YOU'RE READY PLEASE BEGIN. YES ALL RIGHT- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA SURE MCCARTY MEMBERS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION- COMMITTEE ON THE MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER TWO I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY. AS AS WAS SAID EARLIER MY NAME IS STEVEN COULD LOWER I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR THE SS ECO WHAT I'M PROPERTIES GOVERNANCE AND ADVOCACY GROUP RECOGNIZED IN THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS THAT REPRESENTS THE OVER TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS. AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. YES YOUR BILL HAS BEEN FIRST RIGHT AND NEED IN MY DIFFERENT WE HAVE ADOPTED LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENTS. WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR STUDENT FRANCHISE MADE GETTING THE STUDENTS VOTING PRIVILEGES WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR STUDENT NINE PLUS ONE RIGHT. DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION ON CAMPUSES- EVEN ADOPTED AN ANTI RACISM STUDENT PLAN OF ACTION THIS YEAR. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CODE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HARD ON A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT ESPECIALLY OUR STUDENTS. WE'VE BEEN REACHING OUT TO OUR STUDENTS DO TOWN HALLS. REGION MEETINGS- AND SURVEYS TO GAUGE THEIR MOST CRITICAL NEEDS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. STUDENTS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AND THEY'VE SPOKEN UP ON ISSUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE BASIC NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE STUDENT SERVICES AND EVEN STUDENT WORKER OPPORTUNITIES. THE THING IS A LOT OF THESE ISSUES WERE ACTUALLY PRESENT CREE COVE IT AND THE PANDEMIC IS ONLY EXACERBATED THE- ALTHOUGH IN THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSES TRIPLE C. I'M ALSO A STUDENT READ THE COLLEGE. IN THE HEART OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I AM S. M. S. STUDENT THAT IS EXPERIENCING A LOT OF THESE ISSUES SO THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME. AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC I AM A- THE OLDEST OF FIVE CHILDREN AND MY YOUNGEST IS THAT IS MY LITTLE SISTER. AND SHE MOVED IN WITH ME. SHE RECENTLY DROPPED OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SO SHE COULD WORK FULL TIME AS A HEALTH CARE WORKER SHE'S A CNA. AT A LOCAL CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL THIS IS ACTUALLY PUT MYSELF AND MY FAMILY IN JEOPARDY I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TESTED WEEKLY FOR KOBE. BECAUSE MY SISTER BACK IN JUNE TESTED POSITIVE. BECAUSE THERE IS AN OUTBREAK AT HER ADDED CONVALESCENT HOME. BECAUSE SHE'S IN A VERY VULNERABLE POSITION. I'M ALSO A FATHER THAT'S GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. MY FAMILY WENT FROM A DUAL INCOME TO A SINGLE INCOME BECAUSE MOST OF MY SIGNIFICANT OTHER HAD TO ACTUALLY QUIT HER JOB IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FIVE YEAR OLD WAS ACTUALLY DOING IS ON MY SCHOOL WORK AND MAKING SURE THAT HE WAS. THERE ANY CITIZEN CLASSES. I'M ALSO P. TEACHER FOR A LOCAL K. THREE SIX. AND I'VE HAD TO HAVE FLUCTUATING WORK HOURS THAT IS CONFLICTED WITH MY SCHOOL SCHEDULE. AND IF YOU THINK THAT- COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN AND PUBLIC COMMENTS CAN GET OUT OF HAND. I WANT YOU TO TRY TEACHING SIXTY KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS ON ZOOM. YOU KNOW WHILE THEY'RE SHOWING YOU EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR HOUSE. MOREOVER JUST FOR EXAMPLE- TECHNOLOGY IN BROADBAND ISSUES. ARE ARE EXISTING IN IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IN ORDER CAN TO CONTINUE THEIR STUDIES. BUT THIS RESOURCES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS. SPECIFICALLY AT MY COLLEGE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL% SEMESTER SEMESTER THERE WAS A TWO WEEK WAITING PERIOD FOR ANY STUDENT THAT WANTED TO GET A COMPUTER WHY FIVE BECAUSE THOSE RESOURCES WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME. SO FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF SCHOOL WE HAD STUDENTS THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO CHECK THEIR CANDIDATES. GOING TO THERE'S CLASSES OR UTILIZE ANY OF THOSE RESOURCES BECAUSE THE RESOURCES WERE NOT THERE. I ALSO LIVE IN A RURAL PART OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OR BROADBAND INTERNET. IS NOT REALLY READILY AVAILABLE THERE IS NO XFINITY. SATELLITE INTERNET IS NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO GET ON TO DO. SO I HAD TO ACT ACTUALLY PURCHASE A SECOND CELL PHONE TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE A HOT SPOT. YOU MAY NEED- TO MY- PHONE CARRIER JUST TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE MY STUDIES. OTHER STUDENTS. THEY HAVE THAT. WITH THE RESOURCE LIKE I DO AT THE END THEY'RE IN THE SAME SHE USES I AM. ANOTHER ISSUE IS BASED NEEDS. WE HAVE STUDENTS EXPERT PRUDENCE. HOUSE AND SIX. AND THE RESOURCES EXIST FOR THEM TO UTILIZE. BUT THEIR RESOURCES ARE NOT AS READILY AVAILABLE AS THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE IN PERSON. MY SCHOOL IS DOING TWO DAYS A WEEK FOOD PANTRY. BUT WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS DON'T JUST EXPERIENCE FOOD INSECURITY IS TWO DAYS A WEEK. I'M FORTUNATE BECAUSE I DO HAVE A JOB THAT NOT ALL STUDENTS ARE AS LUCKY AS ME. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO- YOU KNOW. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE TWENTY DOLLARS THAT IT TOOK FOR ME TO PURCHASE THIS JACKET JUST TO BE HERE BECAUSE MY NORMALS IN THE- WASN'T APPROPRIATE FOR THIS MEETING. I ACTUALLY IF I ALREADY EXPERIENCED THIS- IS THIS PANDEMIC FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. I WAS ACTUALLY COUCHSURFING FOR THREE SEMESTERS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I GOT MY STUDIES DONE. AND I LOOK TO THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THAT SITUATION NOW. AND HOW ARE THEY BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW THE FOOD PANTRY I FREQUENTED DAILY. I HAD TO GET YOU KNOW MY CUP OF NOODLES MY MAC AND SHE'S JUST TO BE ABLE TO FEED MYSELF EVERY DAY. AND THEY'RE STILL STUDENTS OUT THERE THAT NEED THAT RESOURCES DAILY AND IF THOSE RESOURCES ARE JUST NOT THERE AS WE- EARLIER THERE ARE STUDENTS THAT ARE BREAKING LEASES SO I THINK YOU. SO MUCH CHAIRMAN ENOUGH FOR BRINGING THAT UP BECAUSE IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THERE ARE STUDENTS THAT ARE DOING THAT ALSO. AND THAT THAT HOUSING IN SECURITIES AND THE- THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THE FAT IS PUTTING IT THAT MAN IS INSURMOUNTABLE. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STUDENT SERVICES WE HAVE ADMISSIONS COUNSELING FINANCIAL AID EUROPEAN SDS **** ALL THE STUDENT SERVICES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC I THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BECOME MORE READILY AVAILABLE. AND OVER TIME THEY HAVE BEEN. BUT NOW THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS THAT STILL DO NOT HAVE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE RESOURCES. TO BE ABLE TO STAY. IN THE KNOW WITH ALL OF THE SERVICES. STATE OR WHAT THE SERVICES ARE NOW DOING IS THEY'RE ACTUALLY SERVING JUST THOSE THAT HAVE RELIABLE INTERNET. THE TIME TO TAKE OUT OF THEIR DAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT TAKES TWO TO. BE A PART OF THOSE. BE A PART OF THOSE STUDENTS SERVICE MEANING. ARE SO WORKERS. AS YOU KNOW AND CUTTING DOWN ON ON JOB. AND DO THINGS LIKE OUR STUDENTS WORKERS WERE OF THE FIRST TO GO AND I NEED. DOESN'T WORK FOR US TO MORE. WHEN THERE'S LESS OFF. NOW IN ONLINE AND BY. FOR IF STUDENTS TO. BE WITH THEIR CAMP. ANOTHER AND ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT ARE MEANT HEALTH IT. HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW REACHING AND SAYING MENTAL IS THAT UTMOST IMPORTANCE. AND IT ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THING THAT THERE'S FROM THE MOST IS THE LACK RESOURCES FOR MEANT HEALTH. YES IF YOU'RE BUSY CONDUCT A SURVEY THAT HIGH. THE ON IS. AND OVER 65% OF THE RESPONSES SAID THE STUDENTS WERE- WE'RE SUFFERING FROM SOME SORT OF MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES BY THE TRANSITION TO ONLINE LEARNING. THEY IT'S EXPECTING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. THEIR THAT THEY'RE NOW IN ARE NOT SAFE THEY MIGHT BE TO BUSY AND NOW CLASSES IN SOME IN SOME INTO CLASS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING HARDER. TO GET THREE COMMUNICATION CLASS WHERE YOU KNOW IN IN WHEN I WAS TAKING A IN PERSON I WOULD GO TO CLASS YOU KNOW PARTICIPATE IN MY LECTURE GO HOME AND PREPARE FOR THE TIME THAT I NEED TO SPEAK. OR WHEN THAT CLASS TRANSITION TO ONLINE LEARNING I ACTUALLY HAD A DISCUSSION BOARD POST THAT WAS DUE EVERY WEEK AN ARTICLE THAT I HAD TO READ AND WRITE ON. AND THEN ALSO ON TOP OF THAT SPEAKING- AND MAKING MY SPEECH AND ACTUALLY HAVING TO DO IT IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY ELSE. THERE WAS. I CAN'T USE SOME TEACHERS ARE ACTUALLY REQUIRING THAT CAMERAS ARE TO BE ON. FOR ME I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW MY SCHEDULE DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW FOR ME TO ALWAYS HAVE MY CAMARON DURING OUR MY MEETINGS. HI I'M A MULTI TASKER I CAN ALSO DO MY SCHOOL WORK WHILE BRUSHING MY TEETH AND YOU KNOW COOKING FOR MY SON WHILE HE'S ACTUALLY ON HIS- ON HIS CLASS FOR HIS KINDERGARTEN CLASS SO- YOU KNOW THE RESTRICTIONS FOR CAMERA USE IT. IS SOMETHING THAT'S THERE TO- FIND FINANCIAL AID IS OF ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT SET UP TO ACCOUNT FOR THE TRUE COST OF COLLEGE. WHY IS IT THAT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THEM IS THE- CHEAPEST TUITION BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE OPTION BECAUSE WE'RE- AS WAS STATED BYPASS BY CHANCE OR NEVER AT EARLIER. NO LESS THAN 7% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVING CAL GRANT. SAYS A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY BEING EQUIPPED WITH THE RESOURCES TO GET THROUGH THEIR- SCHOOL AND GETTING THE FUNDING THAT THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY GO THROUGH. I RECEIVED- I DO NOT RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID AT ALL TO BE A PART OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM I SUPPORT MYSELF THROUGH MY JOB. AND I RECEIVED A ONE TIME DAY CARES FOR GRANT FUNDING. AND AS A CHAIR MEDINA SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN A NINE MONTH- PANDEMIC AND I RECEIVED ONE CHECK FOR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS- AND- AND THAT HAS HAD THE LAST. FOR NINE MONTHS ON TOP OF ONE ON TOP OF MY WORK SO YOU KNOW OTHER STUDENTS ARE ARE GO. THROUGH THIS WHOLE THIS WHOLE THING ALSO SO. I JUST WANT TO SAY CLOSE. I JUST ONE TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR. THIS HEARING AND AN AND LISTENING TO US- AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO CAME BEFORE ME I LOOK FORWARD TO THE REMEDIES THAT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS- AND THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS SO THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THAT PERSPECTIVE FOR OUR TWO MILLION PLUS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS- LASTLY WERE HAVING A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SATIATE. STUDENTS ASSOCIATION. EIGHT IN THE AVAILABLE. YES I AM. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA JR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS A NURSE TOSSING HIM I'M A RISING SENIOR MAJORING IN GLOBAL STUDIES AT UCLA AND I'M PROUD TO SERVE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION THE OFFICIAL VOICE OF OVER TWO HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THIS LEGISLATURE FOR ITS LEADERSHIP IN PROTECTING STUDENTS FROM THE MOST SEVERE IMPACTS OF THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES DURING THE ONSET OF THIS PANDEMIC THIS LEGISLATURE PROTECTED BASIC NEEDS FUNDING STATE CAL GRANT AID AND SUPPORT FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND THE STATE BUDGET. AND AS WE CONFRONT YET ANOTHER YEAR OF PANDEMIC AHEAD OF US THESE CONTINUE PROTECTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS EXCEPT THERE'S ONE THING THAT STUDENTS HAVE LEARNED OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS IT'S BEEN PASSED THE CRISES WE FACE BEFORE HAVE ONLY BEEN DEEP IN BY THIS PANDEMIC AND IN ANY APPLICABLE COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE AND RECOVERY WE ONLY BOLD SOLUTIONS TO THE ACCESS. BASIC NEEDS BROADBAND AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISES. IMPACTING STUDENTS RIGHT NOW. NOW I WANT TO SET US THE CURRENT BECAUSE WE'RE MEETING AT A CRUISE INFLECTION POINT IN THE FUTURE OF ACCESS. FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. JUST A WEEK AGO THE USE OF AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. FOR THE ADMISSION OF UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS T UC WAS VOTED DOWN BY THE CALIFORNIA ELECTORATE. AND INTEREST TWO WEEKS ANXIOUS FUTURE UC STUDENTS WILLSUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND ADMISSIONS CYCLE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BY CALL BUT- WE ARE ALREADY SEEING HOW THIS PANDEMIC HAS PUSHED VULNERABLE STUDENTS. OUT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THE NEXT GENERATION OF UC STUDENTS. BY NOT INVESTING IN UC STUDENT ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS OR STATE PROGRAMS. SET UP A NATIONAL LIKE YOU SEE SCOUT VITAL IN PER. TENS OF HIGH SCHOOLS WITH ACCESS TO THE COURSE THEY NEED. TO SATISFY A THREE G. OR- SEVERAL. STUDENT INITIATED SAY POP. WHICH ARE PROVEN TO BE OF THEM SUCCESS WAYS. TO AND- UNDER A TO. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTION OUR NEED FURTHER. TO BUILD STUFF SYSTEM FOR ON REPRESENT STUDENTS. BUT I YOUR COMMITTEES NOW EVEN MARK YOU GET OUT TO USE. VERY FIRST BASIC NEEDS ACCESS HIGH AND THESE BASIC NEEDS. HAVE ONLY IN. DURING THE DOWN. NEARLY ONE IN THREE COLORS RED L. TO AND ONE IN FOR NINE HOLE GRANT OF WHICH ELIGIBLE. WERE BEING VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. AND THESE BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES ARE HEIGHTENED FOR DOCUMENT STUDENTS OR INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FORMS OF SUPPORT. NO GRATEFUL FOR THE ONE TIME FUNDS IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET THAT WAS APPROVED. TO PROVIDE AID TO UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ACROSS THREE PUBLIC EDUCATION SEGMENTS. BUT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC OF THIS PANDEMIC WILL LAST BEYOND THIS BUDGET CYCLE AND ADDITIONAL ONE TIME DOLLARS FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT AID ARE NECESSARY IN THE YEAR AHEAD. ON THE GROUND. NEEDS PERSON HAVE TAKE THE ROLE OF PANDEMIC FIRST FIRST. MARSHALLING SCARCER. TO UC'S MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. BUT THEY'RE CRUCIAL WORK IS CONSTRAINED IN ADDRESSING NEW AND EMERGING BASIC NEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THIS PANDEMIC. BURKE STUDENT TRANSIT ACCESS IS A BASIC NEED. FOR STUDENT LEARNING ONLINE INTERNET ACCESS IS A BASIC NEED. AND FOR A PARENTING STUDENT CHILD CARE IS A BASIC NEED. BUT UNDER CURRENT STATE STATUTE STATE BASIC NEEDS DOLLARS CAN ONLY NARROWLY BE USED FOR ADDRESSING FOOD AND HOUSING INSECURITY. EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF WHAT STATE BASIC NEEDS FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR AND DO A LOT OF GOOD IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF UC'S MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS DURING THIS MOMENT. AND FAR BEYOND. AND ONE OF THESE EMERGING BASIC NEEDS WHICH STUDENTS ARE SPECIALLY STRUGGLING WITH. OVER A YEAR OF ONLINE LEARNING IS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE RELIABLE BROADBAND INTERNET. WELL PUBLIC EDUCATE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN PROVIDING STUDENTS. ACCESS TO NECESSARY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TO PURSUE ONLINE. FOR MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THE STATE OF ALL LOW COST BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS REMAINS ELUSIVE. HAVE YOU SEE STUDENTS AND 60% OF NON FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING ACCESS TO RELIABLE INTERNET FOR THEIR STUDIES I THINK THEY'RE DOWN OVER A YEAR PERHAPS OF CONTINUED ONLINE LEARNING. ADDING TO THE EDUCATION TRUST LAST OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND UC STUDENTS AND OVER ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- ACROSS SEGMENTS HAVE NO INTERNET ACCESS. AND WITHIN THE DIGITAL CLASSROOM OVER ONE IN THREE STUDENTS DON'T EVEN FEEL CONFIDENT AND USE THESE TOOLS FOR REMOTE LEARNING. A STATISTIC THAT IT'S EVEN WORSE AMONG LACK NEXT BLACK AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. THEY CAN STEP INTO A THE OF BY TWO THREE THINGS FIRST BY WORKING WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE REDUCED PRICE CONNECTIVITY. FOR LOW INCOME POST SECONDARY STUDENTS WITHOUT A CAP ON SPEED. SECOND BY INVESTING IN NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS PORTABLE CELLS ON WHEELS TO CLOSE COVERAGE GAPS FOR STUDENTS AND RURAL AND UNDER SERVED REGIONS. AND THIRD OF CONTINUING TO EMPOWER INSTITUTIONS TO DISTRIBUTE PORTABLE HOTSPOTS AND DEVELOP LOCALIZED BROADBAND PROGRAMS FOR THEIR STUDENTS SUCH AS THE PROGRAM'S DISC DESCRIBED TODAY. BUT BEYOND THE VISIBLE DIGITAL DIVIDES THERE EXISTS A GROWING INVISIBLE CRISIS AFFLICTING YOU SEE STUDENTS AND STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE GROWING NATIONAL STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. AT THE END OF THE JUNE ACADEMIC YEAR JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL REPORTED THAT ONE INFOUR PEOPLE AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE. IN ADDITION 92% OF YOU SEE STUDENTS REPORT BEING WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF BEING ISOLATED FROM THEIR FRIENDS DURING COVERT NINETEEN. WELL NEARLY 60% OF STUDENTS NATIONALLY REPORT BEING WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THIS PANDEMIC ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. ADDRESSING THIS CONCERNING TREND REQUIRES US TO INVEST IN PREVENTION AFTER. NOW MORE EVER AND THAT'S WHY WE AS UC'S ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF UC HEALTH'S PROPOSED STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH BUDGET REQUEST TO THE STATE. THAT IS BEING PRESENTED AT THE UC REGENTS MEETING NEXT WEEK. AS YOU CAN SEE THE SIX MONTHS HAVE NOT BEEN EASY FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS AND WE HAVE A LONG HARD ROAD I HAD. TO RESPOND AND RECOVER TO COVERT NINETEEN IN A WAY THAT BEST SUPPORT STUDENTS. EVEN WITH SOME OF THE BEST EFFORTS MADE BY OUR INSTITUTIONS WE NEED THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE STATE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE DEEP BARRIERS. AND ACCESS GAPS AMONG OUR STUDENTS. AND IN THE COMING MONTHS UC STUDENTS LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR TO BEST SUPPORT THE OVER ONE QUARTER MILLION STUDENTS. IF NOT IN PERSON OVER THE NEXT YEAR BUT IN THEIR HEARTS CALLED YOU SEE HOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- PERSPECTIVE FROM THE- UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS STUDENTS. AND IN APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK AS WELL. THAT CONCLUDES I DO NOT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR EITHER YOU NOR STEVEN BUT THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING AN INSIGHT ON WHAT THE REALITY IS FOR SOME OF OUR STUDENTS TODAY AND- WE'VE WE'VE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR THE LAST. COUPLE YEARS ANYWAY ABOUT THE NEEDS ESPECIALLY THE COMMUNICATORS I WANNA SAY TELL THAT TO STEVEN. AND SO WILL CERTAINLY YOU KNOW COULD TAKE THESE ISSUES INTO CONSIDERATION WE- LOOK AT CRAFTING NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AND IN LOOKING AT HAD PUBLIC POLICY RELATED TO OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OUR STUDENTS- WITH THAT WE NOW HAVE- PUBLIC COMMENTS. WITHOUT ANY OTHER MEMBERS HERE ASKING QUESTIONS AS WELL WITHOUT PUBLIC COMMENT IF WE HAVE ANYBODY- ON THE LINE WE CAN WE CAN KICK YOU OUT. IF NOT JUST A REMINDER THE PUBLIC COMMENT NUMBER IS. ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. ACCESS CODE FORTY TWO A TWO THIRTEEN FIFTEEN. AGAIN THE NUMBER IS. ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE IS FORTY TWO OH TWO. THIRTEEN FIFTEEN. DO WE HAVE ANYBODY. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. WE HAVE A GENTLEMAN ONCE AGAIN AS A REMINDER IF YOU ARE. YOU ON THE PHONE LINE TO WHICH TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. WHILE WE WAIT FOR THAT DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT FROM ANYBODY IN THE ROOM. HI MY NAME IS KATHERINE MCBRIDE. I'M A GRADUATE OF SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY. I'VE SPENT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN CLASSROOMS AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER. FIRST I WANT TO MENTION THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM THERE IS NO PANDEMIC EMERGENCY IT'S AN OUTBREAK THE VIRUS HAS A GREATER THAN 99% RECOVERY RATE AND IS NO WORSE THAN THE FLU. I AGREE WITH GALLAGHER ON THE- IMPORTANCE OF GETTING BACK TO IN PERSON IN PERSON LEARNING THE CAMARADERIE IN SCHOOL LIFE IS A HUGE PART OF LEARNING PROCESS. THERE'S GREAT JOY. IN THE IN PERSON LEARNING I CANNOT IMAGINE BEING A STUDENT IN THIS DYSTOPIAN NEW NORMAL ENVIRONMENT. THERE'S NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING OR EVEN MASKS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. THIS IS ALL UNNECESSARY COLLEGES TRADITIONALLY OFFERED ONLINE CLASES THIS IS GREAT FOR SOME STUDENTS EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT LEARNING STYLES. HOWEVER THIS IS LEARNING IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. FURTHERMORE THE USES AT A GREAT A VERY LOW RISK OF COVER DEATH WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR THIS MINDSET IS FAR MORE UNHEALTHY THAN THE RISK OF KOBE DEATH SUICIDE RATES AVE SKYROCKETED IN THE USE. TOO MUCH TIME AND MONEY IS BEING SPENT ON COBIT PLEASE STOP WASTING OUR TAX DOLLARS ON THE PLAN THE PLAN DOWN MAKE AND DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE MOMENT CONTINUES TO DROP. AT THE RATE THIS IS GOING. THE BECAUSE THE TESTING IS USELESS AN INACCURATE. THE PROPOSAL CONTACT TRACING OF VACCINES IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD NEVER INCLUDING YOUR BUDGET. THANK YOU MAY HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WRAP UP THANK YOU. I USUALLY HAVE A MINUTE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT NOT A LOT OF ANY HERE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE SO. IF YOU KEEP IT INTERESTING I'LL BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE. SO TODAY WE TALKED ABOUT BUDGETING FOR HER EDUCATION RIGHT HOW TO DISTRIBUTE MORE OF OUR MONEY. THROUGH YOUR SUGGESTIONS CORRECT HOW OFTEN DO ANY OF YOU TAKE A STRANGER'S ADVICE ON HOW AND WHERE TO SPEND YOUR MONEY. SO HOW DOES THAT IN MENTIONING HOW WE NEED TO DEVISE WAYS TO MITIGATE JOB CUT OFF. FROM AN ORCHESTRATED ECONOMIC CRASH MAYBE WE COULD ACTUALLY EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS. FUNDED TEACHING KIDS HOW THE SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS THEM FAR MORE THAN ANY HOMEMADE FABRIC MASK EVER COULD FROM ALLY. FIND TEACHING THEM HOW TO GO AFTER IN FOR THE- FIND THEM HOW TO READ THEM BACK INSERTS. FIND EXPOSING HOW INDOCTRINATED THEIR EDUCATION REALLY IS. FINE TEACHING STUDENTS THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO SUFFER IN SCHOOL FOR YEARS THEN IN THEIR FUTURE JOB TO HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER THAT'S JUST AS WORTHLESS AS THE U. S. CONSTITUTION IS TO ALL OF YOU. AND MAYBE FOR EXTRA CREDIT LET'S BUDGET SOME MONEY FOR TEACHING THEM ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION AND THE ROTHSCHILD FAMILY. THANK YOU. BUT.
