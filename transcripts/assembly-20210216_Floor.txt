THE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL TWENTY NINE BY SENATOR- BURKE AND OTHERS AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS IN THE CLEARLY URGENCY THERE ARE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. MR BERMAN YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB TWENTY NINE AUTHORED BY SENATOR UMBERG. SB TWENTY NINE WILL REQUIRE ELECTION OFFICIALS TO MAIL A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. TO EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTER FOR SPECIAL ELECTIONS HELD IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. AND WILL ALSO REQUIRE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS TO USE A VOTE BY MAIL TRACKING SYSTEM. THAT WILL ALLOW VOTERS TO TRACK THEIR BALLOTS. TO PROTECT BOTH VOTERS AND POLL WORKERS LAST YEAR I AUTHORED A. B. C. EIGHT SIXTY. WHICH WAS A SUCCESSFUL STRONGLY BI PARTISAN EFFORT. THAT APPLY TO THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION AND REMIND EVERYBODY. NINE REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR AB EIGHT SIXTY LAST YEAR. THIS YEAR SB TWENTY NINE EXTENDS OF THOSE VOTE BY MAIL RULES FOR SPECIAL ELECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I THINK WE SHOULD EXTEND THE KEY PROVISIONS OF AB EIGHT SIXTY PERMANENTLY. AND I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO DO SO. I BELIEVE THAT THOSE CHANGES WILL LEAD TO MORE INCLUSIVE AND REPRESENTATIVE ELECTIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO DEBATE ON THAT BILL LATER THIS YEAR. SB TWENTY NINE DOES NOT SEEK TO ENACT LONG TERM- ELECTIONS POLICY. RATHER THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS NOT GONE AWAY. IT CONTINUES TO THREATEN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. AS A RESULT WE NEED TO ACT QUICKLY TO EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS AUTHORIZED BY EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY FOR ELECTIONS HELD THIS YEAR. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AB EIGHT SIXTY WAS A HUGE SUCCESS WELL THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT AFFECT TURN OUT IT IS NOTABLE THAT MORE THAN 80% OF CALIFORNIANS REGISTERED VOTERS CAST BALLOTS. IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION THE HIGHEST CALIFORNIA TURN OUT SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY TWO. WHEN GIVEN THE OPTION THIS PAST ELECTION NEARLY 87% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS CHOSE TO VOTE. USING THE BALLOT THAT WAS MAILED TO THEM PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA'S RURAL RURAL COUNTIES WHICH I'VE WRITTEN IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SB TWENTY NINE ALSO ENJOYS THE SUPPORT OF LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES THE TWO COUNTIES THAT CURRENTLY ARE HOLDING SPECIAL ELECTIONS. TO FILL VACANCIES IN THE LEGISLATURE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR UMBERG I AFTER I VOTE ON SB TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU MR BERMAN. DR CHOI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AND A COLLEAGUE SAW TODAY I RISE IN OPPOSITION NOT TO S. B. TWENTY NINE WHICH REQUIRES SO EVERY COUNTY- TO SEND EVERY REGISTERED TO VOTE OR A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT FOR ANY ELECTION TWENTY ONE EVEN IF WILL BE REGISTERED THE BORDER DID NOT THE REQUESTED A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT AND IT REALLY FOR THE ART IS OUR NORMAL HEALTH THOUGHT EMERGENCY. AT THE TIME OF THE ELECTION. WE WERE TOLD THIS UNIVERSAL VOLTA BY MAIL PROCESS WAS UNNECESSARY OF FORTY AT TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION FOR SAFETY REASONS DURING THE OF CORBETT NINETY IN ENDEMIC. HOWEVER WE KNOW IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ADMINISTER IN PERSON ELECTIONS WHILE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH THE FROM COLD WITH NINETY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE REDUCTIONS ARE ARE AUTHORIZED TO FOR YOU SO AND THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE HAVE BEEN VACCINATED ALTHOUGH MANY MILLIONS OR MORE NEEDS TO BE- VACCINATED AS SOON AS A POSSIBLE. SINCE WE ARE MOVING OUT OF THIS UP AND THAT MAKE OUT WITH THE VACCINES AND A WE KNOW WE CAN SAFELY OR FOR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS ARE TO THOSE SO WHO REQUEST ONE WIRELESS SAFETY ALL OFFERING SUCH IN PERSON VOTING FOR THOSE SO WHO DO NOT WANNA RECEIVER A VOTE. BY MAIL BALLOT ARE WILL BE VOTING AGAINST OUR S. B. TWENTY NINE TODAY ALSO A LOT OF A WASTE OF FOR THOSE SO WHO CHOOSE TO MORE DIRECTLY IN PERSON AND- MANY BELLOWS ARE SUBJECT TO BE SENT. TO THOSE TO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALL HAVE BEEN DEAD OR MOVED UP OUT OF THERE. ALL CURRENT HOME. PROTECTING THE INTO OF OUR ELECTIONS SO IT IS SO ONE OF THE MOST A SACRED TO RESPONSIBILITIES SO OR WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT. ANDERSON SAID SB TWENTY NINE PROVISO NORTH STATE GARCIA AGAINST THE VOTER FRAUD AND- MANDATES DO ARE UNIVERSAL MAY LOCK THE BALLOT SYSTEM EVEN IF ALL NORMAL HELD FOR HIM ADJUSTED EXISTS OF LOCALLY I RESPECTIVELY BUDGET A NOVOTEL. ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR CHOI. RECOGNIZE SAYING MR SAY OUR TOE IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY I STAND IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWENTY NINE I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN FOR VOTER HEALTH AND SAFETY AND I OF COURSE SUPPORT ENSURING THAT EVERY CITIZEN WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE AS EASY ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD. HOWEVER THIS LEGISLATION IS SIMPLY NOT NECESSARY. THIS PAST YEAR WE HAVE ADJUSTED TO NEW SAFETY STANDARDS AND THE U. S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL CONCLUDED THAT IN PERSON ELECTIONS. CAN BE SAFELY HELD. WITH A PROPER APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS. VOTERS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT VOTING AT THE POLLS ARE FREE TO VOTE BY MAIL. AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. WE SAW IN THE LAST ELECTION MANY VOTERS ALSO CHOSE TO PHYSICALLY GO TO THE POLLS TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR BALLOT. OR TO UTILIZE ANY OF THE SPECIAL SERVICES. AND THAT IS THEIR RIGHT TO DO SO. WE ALSO OBSERVE THAT THE EFFORT TO CENTRALIZE VOTER LOCATIONS RESULTED IN FEWER LOCAL POLLING LOCATIONS. AND BECAUSE LONGER LINES AND INCREASED. IN PERSON CONTACT. WE STAND HERE AND DISCUSS THE PUBLIC SAY HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE ELECTION YET THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL HEALTH SAFETY OF BALLOT HARVESTING AND INDIVIDUALS GOING DOOR TO DOOR SOLICITING BORDER BY MAIL BALLOTS. I TRULY FEEL THAT WE HAVE THE MEANS AND THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO HANDLE THESE NEXT ELECTIONS WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH. HEALTH IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. AND MISTER BENNETT YOU ALSO ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINETEEN SIXTY POINT NINE MILLION BALLOTS WERE CAST IN STATEWIDE IN SPECIAL ELECTIONS IN OREGON. IN THAT TIME PERIOD THOSE TWENTY YEARS THERE WERE THIRTY EIGHT CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS OF VOTER FRAUD. THAT IS LESS THAN A TEN THOUSANDS OF A PERCENT IN TERMS OF THE PROBLEM. WE HEAR HERE OPPOSITION BASED ON INTEGRITY OF LACKED A LACK SHINS AND VOTER FRAUD IT SIMPLY IS NOT BACKED UP BY THE EVIDENCE. THE EVIDENCE OF A WASHINGTON POST ANALYSIS FOUND THAT. OF FOURTEEN POINT SIX MILLION BALLOTS CAST IN THE FIVE STATES THAT HAVE ALL ACTION BALLOTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AT MOST THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS AND FINALLY THE NONPARTISAN AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION. FOUND THAT. WASHINGTON WOULD HAVE REPORTED EIGHTY MORE CASES OF FRAUD HAD IT NOT INTRODUCED VOTE BY MAIL THE EVIDENCE SIMPLY DOES NOT SUPPORT THE ALLEGATION THAT VOTER FRAUD IS A REASON WHY WE SHOULD NOT DO SOMETHING THAT EXPANDS DEMOCRACY PARTICULARLY EXPANDS DEMOCRACY FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY GETTING TO THE POLLS AND VOTING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT MR MACE YOUR RECOGNIZED I THANK YOU MR SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS- MEASURE I SUPPORTED THIS MEASURE IN COMMITTEE AND THE TRUTH IS- I'VE BEEN A BIG FAN OF A VOTE BY MAIL WELL FOR A VERY LONG TIME I CAN'T THINK OF THE LAST TIME THAT I WANT. TO VOTE IN PERSON. WHAT IS SHOCKING TO ME- IS AT THIS STAGE. OF US EVEN HAVING THIS DEBATE BECAUSE I REMEMBER BEING A- YOUNG ISSUE A REPUBLICAN ACTIVIST. GOING OUT AND TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE BY MAIL BECAUSE WE THOUGHT REPUBLICANS WERE IN TURN OUT. A MORE THE TRUTH IS THIS IS THE SAFEST. IT CAN BE VERIFIED. IT'S CHEAPER IT'S EASIER I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A MEASURE THEY'LL BE COMING FOR THIS NEXT YEAR THEY'LL MAKE THIS PERMANENT IN THE FUTURE. MEMBERS ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. MR BERMAN YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS BILL WOULD ONLY MAKE THESE CHANGES FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AS ONE OF REITERATE THAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY WEAKER THAN THE BILL THAT THIS BODY PASSED LAST YEAR WITH A STRONG BIPARTISAN VOTE INCLUDING NINE OF OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES VOTING FOR MY BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS STRONGER. THAN THIS ONE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HOW MANY COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING ORANGE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE ARE ALREADY VOTERS CHOICE ACT COUNTIES WHERE THE VOTERS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ALREADY GET A BALLOT SENT TO THEM IN THE MAIL AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT REQUESTING ONE ALL THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS EXPAND THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE SAFELY AND SECURELY WITHOUT RISKING THEIR HEALTH- IN ANY SPECIAL ELECTIONS THAT OCCUR IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IT WITH% THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR BERMAN AND WITH THAT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. THIS TAKES FIFTY FOUR ON THE URGENCY. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS WERE IS THERE TO VOTE THIS TAKES FIFTY FOUR. MR BERMAN MOVES A CALL. MEMBERS MEMBERS CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION. LEVINE WE WILL NOW BE MOVING TO THE ASSEMBLY OBSERVANCE OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH. WITHOUT OBJECTION. WE REMOVED THE FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO ACR EIGHTEEN KAMLAGER FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIRD READING. THIS KAMLAGER YOU READY TO PRESENT. THE CLERK WILL READ ACR EIGHTEEN ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION EIGHTEEN BY SIMPLY MEMBER KAMLAGER AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO BLACK HISTORY MONTH. GALLAGHER YOU CAN OPEN ON THE MEASURE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I RISE TO PRESENT ACR EIGHTEEN BLACK HISTORY MONTH. THE STORY OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH BEGINS IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN HALF A CENTURY AFTER THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT ABOLISHED SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT SEPTEMBER THE HARVARD TRAINED HISTORIAN CARTER G. WOODSON AND THE PROMINENT MINISTER JESSE MORLUN FOUNDED THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF NEGRO LIFE AND HISTORY. AN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO RESEARCHING AND PROMOTING ACHIEVEMENTS BY BLACK AMERICANS AND OTHER PEOPLES OF AFRICAN DESCENT. THAT GROUP SPONSORED AND NATIONAL NEGRO WEEK IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX CHOOSING THE SECOND WEEK OF FEBRUARY TO COINCIDE WITH THE BIRTHDAYS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS. IN THE DECADES THAT FOLLOWED MAYORS OF CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BEGAN ISSUING YEARLY PROCLAMATIONS RECOGNIZING NEGRO HISTORY WEEK. BY THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES THANKS IN PART TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND A GROWING AWARENESS OF BLACK IDENTITY NEGRO HISTORY WEEK HAD EVOLVED INTO BLACK HISTORY MONTH ON MANY COLLEGE CAMPUSES. PRESIDENT FORD OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED BLACK HISTORY MONTH IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX CALLING UPON THE PUBLIC TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HONOR THE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED ACCOMPLISHMENTS. OF BLACK AMERICANS IN EVERY AREA OF ENDEAVOR THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. THE BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS NOT ABOUT ELEVATING THAT ONE BLACK FRIEND THAT WE ALL HAVE. IT IS ABOUT HONORING THE RICHNESS THAT WE ALL EXPERIENCE FROM BLACK EXISTENCE. AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT HAS COME AT AN EXTREME COST. AND IF WE ARE TO CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY THEN WE MUST ALL FIGHT FOR BLACK FUTURES. BLACK FUTURES INVITING SISTANCE OUR COLLECTIVE FUTURES WHICH ARE IN PERIL. 73% OF BLACK PEOPLE. LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE OBESITY AND FOOD AND SECURITY. BLACK CHILDREN REPRESENT 19% OF THE NATION'S PRESCHOOL POPULATION YET 47% OF THOSE CHILDREN RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE OUT OF SCHOOL SUSPENSION. 61% OF ACT TESTED BLACK STUDENTS AND GRADUATING CLASSES MEET NONE OF THE FOUR ACT COLLEGE READINESS BENCHMARKS COMPARED HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS. HAVE AN OWNERSHIP RATE OF 61% COMPARED WITH 55% PERCENT FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO ARE BLACK. BLACK PEOPLE ARE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE UNEMPLOYED THAN WHITE AMERICANS. BLACK AMERICANS HAVE LOWER FIGHT GO SCORES MORE STUDENT DEBTS A LARGER AMOUNTS OF HIGH INTEREST DEBTS. HAVE FEWER ASSETS THAN WHITE. AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE HOMEOWNERS TO OWN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES WHAT HAVE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. BLACK PEOPLE WHO OWN FIFTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. ARE EXPOSED TO MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS AIR POLLUTION AND POISONOUS HEAVY METALS. THAT ARE PROFOUNDLY WHITE PEOPLE WITH ANNUAL INCOMES OF LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. THESE STATISTICS ARE SHAMEFUL AND INTERCONNECTED. YET DESPITE THIS DATA. OUR HISTORY REVEALS ARE RELENTLESS FEARLESSNESS. AND THIS COUNTRY'S FEAR OF US. DID YOU KNOW THAT THE EARLIEST ONE OF THE EARLIEST U. S. PATENTS GRANTED WAS TO A BLACK MAN. HOW DO WE KNOW THIS WELL IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE NORBERT RELU INVENTED AN EVAPORATOR THAT WAS USED IN SUGAR PRODUCTION. THE REASON THE PATENT FILE NOTES HIS RACE IS BECAUSE SOMEONE TRIED TO TAKE IT FROM HIM. BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK. OVER SEVEN HUNDRED PATENTS WERE FILED BY BLACK PEOPLE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY AND NINETEEN FORTY. WE INVENTED ALL KINDS OF THINGS THE ELEVATOR. ROTARY ENGINES A TAPERED GOLF T. OF FERTILISER DISTRIBUTOR AND THE PRECURSOR TO THE GAS MASK. BUT THERE WERE DIPS IN THOSE INNOVATIONS. ONE DAY IT WAS IN NINETEEN HUNDRED WITH PLESSY V. FERGUSON. THE SUPREME COURT RULING THAT SAID BLACK PEOPLE WERE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL. SUDDENLY WE WERE KICKED OUT OF LIBRARIES COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS. CUT AWAY FROM TALKING WITH OTHER INVENTORS. WE WERE ALSO LYNCHED AND FORCE TO DEFEND OUR LIVE IN SEGREGATED AMERICA SCOTLAND CONCERT. I THINK OF THOSE HISTORIES. BECAUSE IT HELPS ME NAVIGATE THE GIVE AND TAKE OF BEING BLACK IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SHOULDERING THE BURDEN OF DEFENDING AND DEFINING BLACK EXISTENCE. LAST YEAR MY DAUGHTER WAS SCHOOLS ROOMING WITH HER CLASS. AND THE TEACHER SAID YOU KNOW I'M FROM OHIO WHERE WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BLACK PEOPLE. AND NOW I ONLY PREFER DARK SKINNED PEOPLE. A FEW YEARS AGO MY HUSBAND WHO'S AN ATTORNEY. I WAS DROPPING OFF SOME PAPERWORK AT THE COURTHOUSE IN BUSINESS CASUAL AND THE CLERK SURROUNDED BY STAFF SAID- ARE YOU THE THREE O'CLOCK SURRENDER. YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. DOING HUMANITARIAN WORK. IN THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS OF WEST VIRGINIA WITH MY CLASS THE PRIEST WHO ORGANIZED THE GROUP PULLED ME TO THE SIDE AND SAID. DON'T BE OFFENDED IF SOMEONE CALLED YOU A **** THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A BLACK PERSON BEFORE. I NOW THINK OF THE AUDACITY OF THAT PRIEST AND I'M CLOSING MISTER CHAIR. TO PLACE THAT BURDEN ON A CHILD. TO SHOULDER A LOAN. RATHER THAN TO THE GROUP. AND TO USE THE GROUP'S COLLECTIVE STRENGTH TO COME BACK EDUCATE AND ADDRESS THAT KIND OF IGNORANCE. TELLING ME THAT DIDN'T FIX ANYTHING. IT JUST SHIFTED HIS ACCOUNTABILITY. THESE STORIES OLD AND CURRENT REMIND ME OF HOW WE ARE STILL ON OUR OWN. LIKE HOW ON WE ON HOW. YES LIKE IN TULSA IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE. WHEN THE MASSACRE THAT DAY BURNED DOWN AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF BLACK PEOPLE. SO I CLOSE BY SAYING IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING. IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING DO SOMETHING. I'VE SHARED WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS HISTORY SO THAT NOW YOU KNOW. AND NOW YOU MUST DO. IT IS NOT UP TO ONE BLACK PERSON ON YOUR STREET IN YOUR CHURCH AT YOUR JOB OR IN THESE CHAMBERS TO CARRY THESE BURDENS ALONE. BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW. AND NOW THAT WE KNOW WE MUST DO SOMETHING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR CHURCHES AND OUR WORKPLACES AND IN THESE CHAMBERS TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY TO DEFEND THE EXISTENCE AND TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE. OF BLACK PEOPLE. THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE MR MEDINA FROM THE REAR THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR EIGHTEEN. ACR EIGHTEEN WILL RECOGNIZE FEBRUARY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THISBLACK HISTORY MONTH IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE BLACK HISTORY IS CALIFORNIA HISTORY. WITHOUT THE SOCIAL EDUCATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND SEVERAL OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY OUR STATE WOULD SIMPLY NOT BE WHERE IT IS TODAY. FROM FEARS LEADERS LIKE OUR OWN DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER. CALIFORNIA'S FIRST BLACK SECRETARY OF STATE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILLIE BROWN AND CONGRESS MEMBER KAREN BASS THE FIRST BLACK MEN AND WOMEN SERVICE SPEAKERS OF THE ASSEMBLY RESPECTIVELY. AND CALIFORNIA'S OWN CAMERA HERE'S OUR FIRST BLACK AND ASIAN AMERICAN VICE PRESIDENT. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS GIVEN US EXCEPTIONAL STATE WIDE AND NATIONAL LEADERS. HOWEVER WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE PAINFUL HISTORY. THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS AND DIVERT FROM ITS INCEPTION OF THIS COUNTRY TO THIS DAY. SLAVERY VOTER SUPPRESSION POLICE BRUTALITY AND MORE CONTINUE TO SYSTEMATICALLY SHAPE THE EXPERIENCES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS EVERYWHERE. WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THIS HISTORY WE CANNOT CORRECTIVE THAT IS WHY TEACHING THIS IS ST BEYOND FEBRUARY IS CRITICAL AND WHY THE LATINO CAUCUS HAS PRIORITIZED ETHNIC STUDIES FOR ALL IN RECENT YEARS. THIS PAST YEAR ALONE HAS REMINDED US ALL THE WORK STILL LEFT TO BE DONE. AND HOW WE MUST ALWAYS STRIVE TO BE BETTER ALLIES AND UP LIVE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE TO BOTH CELEBRATE THE TALENTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND RECOMMIT TO WORKING TOWARDS A MORE JUST STATE. AND NATION. THANK YOU MR MEDINA WE WILL NOW RECOGNIZE MISTER BLOOM FROM THE REAR OF THE TRAIN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. EIGHTEEN ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. BLACK HISTORY MONTH HELPS US CHARTER FUTURE BY ASKING US TO REFLECT ON THE LESSONS OF THE PAST. IT ENHANCES OUR APPRECIATION OF THE WIDE RANGING CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN SCIENCE MUSIC LITERATURE AND AS WE JUST HEARD FROM THE MEMBER FROM LOS ANGELES A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ENDEAVORS. THIS MONTH ALSO CALLED ENOUGH TO USE THE LESSONS OF HISTORY SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY AND EMPATHIZE WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY. JUST AS UNDERSTANDING THE HOLOCAUST HELPS GENTILES TO UNDERSTAND JEWS. SO IT IS THAT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AND EVERYONE. I KNOW THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY AND OPPRESSION AND SO MUCH MORE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND JUST WHY BLACK LIVES MATTER. HISTORY SHOWS US WHERE ARE COMMON THREADS ARE AND COMMON THREADS CAN LEAD TO COMMON UNDERSTANDING. BLACKS AND JEWS SHARE EXPERIENCES RANGING FROM SLAVERY TO EXILE DISCRIMINATION AND BEING SUBJECTED TO HATE TO ACTS OF HATE AND INTOLERANCE. HISTORY CAN BE QUITE PERSONAL TO. FOR EXAMPLE THE MEMBER FROM PASADENA AND I. ARE THE SAME AGE AND GREW UP IN THE SAME TOWN. BUT AS THE AS CHILDREN ARE PATHS WOULD LIKELY NOT CROSS BECAUSE THE CITY OF PASADENA AND THE SCHOOLS OF PASADENA WERE DE FACTO SEGREGATED AT THAT TIME. AS A YOUNG CHILD I REMEMBER THE DAWN OF FAIR HOUSING LAWS AND I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE TALK AT THE DINNER TABLE ONE NIGHT. A BRICK IT CRASHED THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAMILIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE LAWS. IN THE DEED RESTRICTED ALL WHITE AND CLAVE OF NEARBY HASTINGS RANCH. HAVE THINGS IMPROVED YES BY SOME METRICS AND NO BY OTHERS. IT'S A SAD COMMENTARY THAT TODAY BLACKS AND JEWS SUFFER FROM THE HIGHEST RATES OF HATE SPEECH AND CRIMES OR THAT SO MANY BLACK LIVES ARE LOST IN ENCOUNTERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO OUR HISTORIES. OUR STORIES HELP TO GUIDE US FORWARD AND I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE EACH OF US INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY TO USE THIS MONTH TO REFLECT ON THE AMAZING HISTORY OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. BLACK HISTORY LIKE JEWISH HISTORY IS A RICH TAPESTRY. AND FOR EACH OF US THERE IS MUCH TO CELEBRATE. YET ALSO SO MUCH THAT IS DISTRESSING. WE SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO USE THAT HISTORY TO HELP US AS DR KING SO ELOQUENTLY PUT IT. TO BEND THE LONG ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE TOWARDS JUSTICE. ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS I THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM LOS ANGELES AND THE BLACK CAUCUS FOR OFFERING IN SPONSORING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION AND ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM THIS WORKS TO RECOGNIZE AND REJECT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS TO SUPPORT ACR EIGHTEEN RECOGNIZING BLACK HISTORY MONTH. BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS A TIME TO CELEBRATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT BLACK WOMEN HAVE MADE TO OUR COUNTRY. IN THIS RECOGNITION OF YOUR HISTORY IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE KNOWLEDGE AND EXULTS. THE WORK OF BLACK WOMEN WHO CONTINUE TO BREAK. BARRIERS ERECTED BY SOCIETY THE CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO FULLY VALUED THEM. DESPITE THE SOCIETAL FAILURES BLACK WOMEN HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT. OF EVERY MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY. FROM ABOLITION TO RECONSTRUCTION TO WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE AND VOTING RIGHTS. FROM WOMEN'S RIGHTS EQUAL PAY TO CIVIL RIGHTS AND LGBTQ LGBTQ RIGHTS. FROM SOCIETAL JUSTICE TO RACIAL JUSTICE TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND POLICE REFORM JUST TO NAME A FEW. AT EVERY FIVE BLACK WOMEN HAVE SHOWN UP FOR THIS NATION AND TAKING MORE OF THE HEADS AND SACRIFICED MORE THAN MANY OF US WILL EVER KNOW OR UNDERSTAND. THEIR WORK IS OFTEN GIVEN THE REST OF US A BLUEPRINT FOR CHANGE WHETHER THEY CHOSE. TO BE LEADERS. OR THE LEADERSHIP WAS FORCED UPON THEM OUT OF NECESSITY. OR SURVIVAL. THE UGLY TRUTH THAT WE SHOULD ALL SET WITH HOWEVER IS THAT BLACK WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE YET TO RECEIVE. THE EQUITY THEY DESERVE THE JUSTICE THEY ARE OWED OR THE PLACE OF THE TABLE POWER THEY HAVE BURNED. WITH EVERY SUCCESS STORY. AND BARRIER BREAKING HIGHLIGHTED IN A C. R. EIGHTEEN THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF BLACK WOMEN WHO FACE A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF DISPARITIES IN PAY. HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HOUSING ACCESS. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. EMPLOYMENT DATA FROM DECEMBER SHOWS THAT WOMEN BORE THE BRUNT OF THE JOB LOSS BUT ALARMINGLY THAT BURDEN IS FALLING SQUARELY ON THE SHOULDERS OF WOMEN OF COLOR. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO LOST EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND JOBS DURING THE MONTH OF DECEMBER. DURING THAT SAME PERIOD WHAT WOMEN ACTUALLY GAINED JOBS. AND THE BLACK WOMEN WHO ARE STILL IN THE WORK FORCE DISPROPORTIONATELY WORK IN SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT SECTORS OF THE PANDEMIC. OFTEN ROLES LACKING PAID SICK LEAVE AND THE ABILITY TO WORK FROM HOME. THAT IS PART OF THE REASON THEY ARE COVERED NINETEEN COMPARED TO THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. AND IRONICALLY ENOUGH IT IS A BLACK WOMAN. DR COMMITTEE CORBETT. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE VACCINE THAT WILL HELP AND THIS PANDEMIC. FOR ALL OF US. AS LEGISLATORS WE HAVE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE EGREGIOUS DISPARITIES AND OTHER INEQUITABLE REALITIES THAT IMPACT BLACK WOMEN BY PASSING LAWS THAT HELP PROTECT WORKING FAMILIES. THESE INCLUDE EXTENDING PARENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE HEALTH CARE THE MATERNAL CARE. IT ALSO INCLUDES RELIEVING THE BURDEN OF THE PANDEMIC WITH ITS INCREASED TESTING IMPACTING DISTRIBUTION AND ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR THE WOMEN WHO HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR HEALTH SECURITY OUR ECONOMY ON THEIR SHOULDERS OF THE CENTRAL WORKERS. INCLUDING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS GROCERY STORE WORKERS AND RETAIL WORKERS CAN SAFELY PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WE SHOULDN'T BE SHOCKED BY THE CONDITIONS THAT ALLOWED THE PANDEMIC TO RAVAGE THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THEY EXISTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT. THAT CENTURIES OF STRUCTURAL RACISM AND STATE SANCTIONED DISCRIMINATION AND VIOLENCE HAVE HAD. ON THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. ONCE WE DO THAT WE CAN ACCEPT OUR ROLE IN RECTIFYING THE CONSEQUENCES AND WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND OTHER BLACK COMMUNITY LEADERS TO TEAR DOWN. THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS THAT CONTINUE TO LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLACK CALIFORNIANS TO THRIVE IN THE STATE. LET'S START TODAY BY SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION THAT CELEBRATES BLACK HISTORY MONTH. I COMMIT TO WORKING TOGETHER FOR GOING FORWARD TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. ON BEHALF OF LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON IT. VETERANS WORKS OF THIS. WERE T ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTRESS IN MY ARE TODAY BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA L. G. CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF A C. EIGHTEEN I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION FORD. MEMBERS LET US BE CLEAR BLACK HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY BLACK HISTORY IS CLEAR HISTORY BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS A CELEBRATION OF BLACK LIVES IN THE COUNTLESS COUNTLESS CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT THERE HAD ON OUR GREAT COUNTRY. THEIR INVENTION HAS PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES OF AMERICAN INNOVATION THEIR BRAVERY IN COMBAT TO DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS WE HOLD SO DEAR AND THEIR PERSISTENCE IN THE FACE OF CONTINUED HOSTILITY HAS PAVE THE WAY. FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF ESSENTIAL CIVIL RIGHTS. IN THE SPIRIT OF INTERSECTION MALADY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THREE IMPORTANT BLACK AMERICANS. IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY WHO I MADE IMMENSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMERICA. BAYARD RUSTIN WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. HE WORKED TOGETHER WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR WITH PHILIP RANDOLPH AND ELLA BAKER HE HELPED ORGANIZE THE MONTGOMERY BOYCOTT. HE ALSO HELPED ORGANIZE FREEDOM WRITES IN THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON. A GAY MAN RUSTIN BECAME A VOCAL ADVOCATE FOR GAY RIGHTS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES A MOVE WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY COURAGEOUS I'VE THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN LGBTQ RIGHTS WERE ACTIVELY OPPOSED BY MUCH OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. ERNESTINE EXISTING EARNEST TIME ASKING WHAT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK CHAPTER OF THE DAUGHTERS ABILITY THE FIRST CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ADVOCATING FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS. SHE WAS THE VETERANS AND CIVIL RIGHTS. SHE ALSO BROUGHT HER EXPERIENCE FROM THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT TO CALL FOR EQUALITY IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY SHE PARTICIPATED IN THE REMINDER DAYS MARCHES WHERE SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON OF COLOR AND OFTEN TIMES THE ONLY WOMAN. TO BE PART OF THE REMINDER DAY DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN. NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. JAMES BALDWIN FAMOUS FOR HIS WORK AS AN AUTHOR AND A PLAY RIGHT MANY OF HIS WORK EXPLORING THE INNER SEXUALITY OF ETHNICITY SEXUALITY AND CLASS IN UNITED STATES HE WAS ALSO ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HE BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE MOVEMENT AFTER REPORTING ON IT FROM THE NEW YORKER THE HARPER HARPER'S AND THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE. WALDRON JOINED THE CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY. HE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY DELIVERING LECTURES ON RACIAL INEQUALITY AND CALLED ON PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. ALONG WITH BAYARD RUSTIN BALDWIN WAS AMONG THE GAY MEN INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT SEVERAL OF HIS NOVELS. INCLUDED OPENLY GAY CHARACTERS AND RELATIONSHIPS. MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ CAUCUS REMAIN TOGETHER IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE BLACK CAUCUS WE JOIN THEM. AND BEING COMMITTED TO WORKING TOWARDS REALIZING OURSHARED DREAMS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A C. R. EIGHTEEN. CERVANTES IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OR DEBATE. ON THIS MATTER. SENATE HEARING NONE HAS COME UNDER YOUR CLOTHES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM ALL OF THE CAUCUSES. FROM ACROSS THE STATE FOR SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. EIGHTEEN. YOU KNOW I BRIEFLY MENTIONED NINETEEN TWENTY ONE IT WAS THE YEAR OF ONE OF THE MOST WORST WORST INCIDENTS OF RACIAL VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN HISTORY IT WAS THE TULSA RACE MASSACRE. WHERE BLACK PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON SIGHT. AND IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND BLACK AFFLUENCE AND EXISTENCE WAS LITERALLY BURNED TO THE GROUND. NO ONE CAME TO HELP THEM. AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOT THE STATE GOVERNMENT. NOT EVEN THE FEDS. NO ONE MATT TOLD BLACK PEOPLE THAT WE WERE ON OUR OWN. YET STILL WE'VE HAD AN UNBRIDLED NEED AND DESIRE TO CREATE- WHETHER THROUGH ARCHITECTURE SPORTS AKADEMI OF THE LAW. THE CREATIVE ARTS SO I JUST ASK YOU WHEN YOU STOP AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT OR PULL OUT AN IRONING BOARD. THINK OF BLACK INNOVATION WHEN YOU TURN ON YOUR HOME SECURITY SYSTEM OR ADMIRE A TESLA S. MODEL.

TO CHURCH ELDERS AND ANCESTORS. HOWEVER REMEMBERING THE STRUGGLES THAT ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS HAVE ENDURED IN IMMIGRATING TO THE UNITED STATES IS NOT AN EXERCISE THAT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE NEW LUNAR NEW YEAR. OR TWO INDIVIDUALS OF THE API DESCENT IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL DO AS WE SHAPE A MORE INCLUSIVE DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE NOW WELL ACROSS THE COUNTRY OUR API COMMUNITY ENDERS DISCRIMINATION BULLYING AND HARASSMENT. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP USING OFFENSIVE ETHNICALLY BASED TERMS TO DESCRIBE HOLDEN NINETEEN FIELD BIGOTRY AND VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST OUR API COMMUNITY.

MEMBERS YOU SEE WE CELEBRATE THE LUNAR NEW YEAR'S WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT HOLIDAY FOR THE API COMMUNITY. IT IS A TIME FOR FAMILIES TO COME TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE A NEW BEGINNING. IT IS TIME TO CELEBRATE TRADITION AND FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. IT HURTS THAT THIS NEW YEAR HAS BROUGHT SO MUCH HURT AND PAIN AND VIOLENCE. TO NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THIS WHOLE NATION IT HURTS TO KNOW THAT MY áP ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE BEING ATTACKED.

I SUPPORT HR TWENTY THREE. AND. I HAVE A REQUEST FOR A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR MY VERY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN JOSE WITHOUT OBJECTION. VERY WELL SO SUPPORT THIS BILL GREAT BILL THANK YOU SIR. BUT I'M ALWAYS VERY SENSITIVE IT'S LIKE A LITTLE NERVOUS TO ME OKAY A LITTLE NERVOUS TWITCHING ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT. SO MY QUESTION TO MY BROTHER COLLEAGUES. IS WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DEFINITION OF HATEFUL RHETORIC UNDER THIS BILL BECAUSE THAT COULD BE TWISTED AND TURNED BY ANYBODY. SIR SHOW YOU MAY CHOOSE ANSWERED OUR NICHOLS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS BIGGER I AM DETAIL LIKE TO AFTER THE CLOSE. THANK YOU MICHELLE. MISTER CHOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY THREE AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FORTY NINE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH IS ALSO THE FIRST MEETING MAJORITY ASIAN AMERICAN ELECTORAL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. LAST FRIDAY AS MANY OF US CELEBRATED THE LUNAR LUNAR NEW YEAR. THE API CAUCUS HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TO DENOUNCE THE GROWING INCIDENCE OF HATE CRIMES THAT MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. HAVE EXPERIENCED ACROSS THE STATE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. UNFORTUNATELY ON THAT VERY DAY THE MEDIA REPORTED THAT AN INSULTING MESSAGE WAS SCRAWLED IN HUMAN FECES ON THE FRONT DOOR OF AN ASIAN ALL PRE SCHOOL IN THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA. IN MY DISTRICT. WHICH WAS THE LATEST HATE FILLED ATTACK AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS. TO SAY THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS TURNED OUR LIVES UPSIDE DOWN IT'S TRULY AN UNDERSTATEMENT. YET FOR MANY API'S IT HAS ALSO BECOME VERY PERSONAL. SIMILAR TO A TIME BOMB WAITING TO EXPLODE TRIGGERED BY FEELINGS OF ANGER AND FEAR LASHED OUT AGAINST US AND MANIFESTED THROUGH VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ATTACKS. SIMILAR INCIDENTS BEGAN SURFACING SINCE APRIL OF LAST YEAR. WHEN WE LEARNED ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AFTER AN ATTACK BY BULLIES WHO ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING THE VIRUS. THE FOURTH GRADE TEACHER WHO HEARD A STUDENT SAY KILL THE CHINESE. A FAMILY WHOSE VEHICLE WAS VANDALIZED WITH HATEFUL MESSAGE REFERENCING CORONAVIRUS. LIKE EVERYONE ELSE API SO ALSO VICTIMS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION YES LASHING OUT ONCE RESTORATION OF THAT WOULD VIOLENCE AGAINST API COMMUNITY IS WRONG. VIOLENCE WILL NOT BRING THIS PANDEMIC TO AN END BUT IT WILL CONSOLE DIVISIONS AMONG US COMMUNITIES AND UNDERMINED THE TRUST THAT IS NECESSARY TO DEFEAT THIS VIRUS. IN FACT MANY API GROUPS TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO RAISE MONEY IN A QUIET PP PUTS PEOPLE IN NEED. FOR EXAMPLE IN A SAN DIEGO VALLEY AREA WHICH IS WHY REPRESENT MORE THAN A MILLION A PP PIECES WERE DONATED TO FRONTLINE WORKERS AND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WITHIN WEEKS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE ARE FIGHTING THE SAME BATTLE. IF WE ARE TO PREVAIL DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES WE MUST ADDRESS ISSUES OF DISCRIMINATION. BY DISPELLING NEGATIVE IMAGES AND ATTITUDES AND HIGHLIGHTING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR STATE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. LET US PUSH BACK ON THOSE WHO THROUGH ACTS OF DISCRIMINATION. SEEK TO DIVIDE US. WE MUST STAND UNITED AND THIS OF ALL VIOLENCE WHEN WE SEE IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN MOTIVATED BY HATE. HEY CRIMES HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY PLEASE FILL AYE ON HR TWENTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MICHELLE MISTER COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY THREE MY COLLECTION CABLE I HEAR YOUR PASSION I HEAR ANGER AND I SUPPORT YOU. UNCOMMITTED BASED ON HATE AND IGNORANCE OR GERM INTOLERANCE DIRECTOR THE GROUP INDIVIDUAL HAVING COMMON CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS RACE RACE. ETHNICITY RELIGION NATIONALITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER EVEN PEOPLE WITH MENTAL OR PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. HEY MOTIVATED CRIMES CAN INCLUDE ACTS SUCH AS VERBAL THREATS. PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSAULT. AND EVEN MURDER. CALIFORNIA PENALIZE THOSE CONVICTED OF HATE CRIMES WITH MISDEMEANORS OR FELONY CONVICTIONS. IN THE MOST SEVERE CASES THE PERSON TO BE SENT TO STATE PRISON. STATE PRISON CONDITIONS MEAN THE PERPETRATOR ACTED VIOLENTLY THE VICTIM OF VICTIM SUFFERED GREAT INJURY BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY. SADLY THESE TYPES OF CONVICTIONS ARE CONSIDERED NON. UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. AND ALLOW FOR THE PERPETRATOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EARLY PRO OPPORTUNITIES. ONLY. SERVING A FRACTION OF THEIR SINS. MEMBERS WE HATE CRIMES ARE GOING. NOT GOING DOWN. THIS IS HR SERVICE RESOLUTION TO RUN A PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON THAT'S PRETTY EASY TO PRESS. BUT WHAT'S THANK MORE PRESSING LATER THIS YEAR YOU'LL BE OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YOU'LL SEE BILLS THAT WOULD ADDRESS HATE CRIMES. HAVE GONE UP. HONG KONG FLU THE ASIAN FLU I MEAN YOU HEAR THAT EVERYDAY. TALK ABOUT API WITH THE TRANSGENDER OF DRAMATICALLY MUSLIM OF DRAMATICALLY. AND OTHERS IN OUR COUNTRY SO HOW DO WE PROTECT. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE ONE SET UP INCIDENT SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT THAT'S GREAT IT'S A RESOLUTION BUT LATER ON THIS YEAR. WHO CAN STAND UP FOR THE VICTIMS IN THIS. BECAUSE SOMEONE CONVICTED OF A HATE CRIME A VIOLENT HATE CRIME. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD GO TO PRISON. IF YOU'RE BURNED OUT A SYNAGOGUE KELOWNA API COMMUNITY MEMBER. OR SOME OTHER TRANSGENDER. FOR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. YOU DESERVE SEVERE PUNISHMENT THE RIVER IS THE WHAT HAPPENED THERE THIS YEAR. MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN YOU IF WE DO THE RIGHT THING AND WHO WE STAND FOR. THAT'S WE WILL COME DOWN TO SELL I URGE YOU SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION IS A GREAT RESOLUTION AND MY BROTHER FROM CAMPBELL. THANK YOU I LOVE YOU. AMOS COOPER. MR LEE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THANK YOU MEMBERS ARE RISING AND EXPRESSING A STRONG SOLITUDE WITH US ALL THE ALREADY WITH US AND YOUR SUPPORT I REPRESENTS A DISTRICT THAT IS A PLURALITY ASIAN AMERICANS NOT QUITE LIKE THE FORTY NINTH DISTRICT WHICH IS A MAJORITY OF ASIAN AMERICANS THAT WE DO HAVE A COMPETITION OF WHO HAS THE BETTER FOOD ASIAN FOOD OUR DISTRICT- BUT I WILL SAY THAT I'VE HEARD A LOT OF COMMENTS WHERE PEOPLE DO FEEL UNHEARD THEY FEEL NEGLECTED. A LOT ASIAN AMERICANS YOUNG AND OLD FEEL SCARED RIGHT NOW AND THEY FEEL PERHAPS EVEN WORSE IGNORED THEY FEEL INVISIBLE AND THIS IS A CENTRAL STRUGGLE TODAY'S AMERICAN IDENTIFYING A VISIBLE UNTIL RECENTLY UNTIL RECENTLY THAT THE NEW START TALKING ABOUT IT AND WE START TALKING MORE ABOUT IT PEOPLE START FEELING LIKE THEIR CONCERNS ARE BEING HEARD AND THAT IS THE IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. IN ADDRESSING THESE HATE CRIMES IN ADDRESSING THE PAIN THAT ARE COMMITTEES ARE SUFFERING. LEWNARD NEW YEAR WHICH CELEBRATED THIS PAST WEEKEND. IS NORMALLY A TIME OF CELEBRATION FOR FAMILIES. BUT THIS YEAR WE'RE FACING FEAR AND UNREST. MANY OF US COULDN'T CELEBRATE THE YEAR OF THE OX. LIKE MYSELF WITH MY GRANDPARENTS BECAUSE OF THE BAD DEMOCRATS. A BUDGET MAKE THAT WE OFTEN. ARE UNFAIRLY SCAPEGOATED FOR AND IS IT. A SURPRISE AT ALL IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE RISE IN ASIAN HATE CRIMES WHEN YOU ADD A SITTING PRESIDENT. VALIDATE CLAIMS SUCH AS THE WUHAN VIRUS THE CHINESE VIRUS WHATEVER RACIAL EPITHET YOU COME UP WITH. AND YOU HAVE HEARD OF PARROTED ACROSS. THE COUNTRY. THAT'S THE COUNTRY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS THE REASON APART A LARGE PART OF WHY WE HAVE THESE THINGS. JUST LAST WEEK IN SAN JOSE IN THE CITY THAT I REPRESENTS A SIXTY FOR ALL GRANT SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER WAS ROBBED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. AHEAD OF LUNAR NEW YEAR. THIS IS HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. TIMES ARE OF COURSE TOUGH AND PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED BUT OUR ASIAN ELDERS WHO ARE THE MOST REVERED MEMBERS ARE COMMUNITIES ARE INNOCENT OF A LARGER FORCES AT PLAY POWER CAUSING THESE THINGS. I AM COMMITTED WITH MY LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES API CAUCUSES ALL THIS CHAMBER TO BE ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES XENOPHOBIA OF RACISM AND CRIME. AND THAT BEGINS. A TOUGH NEW ONCE CONVERSATION ABOUT CRIME ABOUT THE ROLE RACE AND SOCIETY AND I DO BELIEVE THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS READY TO HAVE A- DISCUSSION. JUST OVER THE WEEKEND I WAS HEARTENED TO SEE THE ORGANIZING GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING DONE IN OAKLAND CHINATOWN AS WELL AS MANY OTHER CHINATOWNS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT'S DISPLAYED IN FULL DISPLAY V. INTER GENERATIONAL AND INTERRACIAL SOLAR THAT EXISTS BETWEEN WITH BETWEEN ALL RACES. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO. SEEK TO EXPLOIT SOME FACTS OF THESE INSTANCES TO PUT A WEDGE BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES. I AM NOT I CANNOT RECOUNT YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE SEEN EVEN OTHER ASIAN AMERICANS TO SAY VERY VERY NASTY THINGS. AND JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT IT'S GOT TO COME OUT OF PLACE OF FEAR. AND SOMETIMES FEAR CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR WITH. SO IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE OLIDARITY KEEP WORKING TOGETHER AND KEEP WORKING COMMITTEE DRIVEN APPROACHES TOGETHER BECAUSE WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE ARE SHOULDER WE'RE SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH OUR BLACK SIBLINGS WITH OUR BROWN'S DOUBLING. AND OUR NATIVE SAID LET'S JUST SAYS THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY. HAS PUT MANY MANY CHALLENGES IN FRONT OF ALL OUR COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE STRONGER WHEN WE ARE FIGHTING TOGETHER AGAINST STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT ARE CAUSING THESE THINGS. AND SOMETIMES THESE ANSWERS WILL BE TOUGH THEY'LL BE NUANCE AND THEY'LL BE HARD TO HEAR BUT THOSE ARE THE CHALLENGES WE MUST OVERCOME. ORGANISING I'VE SEEN AMONG THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT FULLY. WITH YOU ALL. SO I'M THANKFUL FOR THE ATTENTION. AND THE PASSION WE HAVE IN THIS CHAMBER AND I FEEL FOR ONE THAT'S- THE HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS NOT IGNORED THIS CHAMBER. AND THAT'S SOMETHING. THE NEW YEAR IS A CHANCE TO START AGAIN AND A SHARE IN THE HOPE OF GOOD THINGS TO COME. TWENTY TWENTY THEYEAR OF THE OX. WHICH IS SAID TO BRING STABILITY AND-CALMNESS. AND I'M HOPEFUL WE WILL EMERGE. FROM THE STRONGER AS A COMMUNITY WITH OUR ALLIES STRONGER AND CALMER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LATE MR GABRIEL. WE ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY THREE. AND ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY WE STAND STRONGLY IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE API CAUCUS AND WITH THE API COMMUNITY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME. AS JEWS WE ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF HATE CRIMES OF THE POWER OF HATE AND BIGOTRY. WE KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE TARGETED WE KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE METAL DETECTORS AND ARMED GUARDS OUTSIDE OF OUR COMMUNITY CENTERS AND OUR HOUSES OF WORSHIP. IT'S FOR THIS REASON THAT WE ARE SO DISHEARTENED AND OUTRAGED. BY THIS SENSELESS VIOLENCE AND THE REALLY UGLY BIGOTRY THAT WE ARE WITNESSING AGAINST THE API COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. I WAS DISCUSSING WITH M COLLEAGUE FROM CAMPBELL LAST WEEK SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES ABOUT THE HATE AND DISCRIMINATION THAT OUR COMMUNITIES FACE ABOUT THE FACT THAT. THEY COME FROM RECYCLED STEREO TYPES FOR BIGOTRY THAT HAS REARED ITS HEAD IN THE PAST. THAT PLAYS ON THE FEAR OF THE OTHER. ABOUT THE VIOLENCE THAT'S OFTEN PRECEDED BY HATEFUL RHETORIC BY PEOPLE WHO MAY BE SPEAKING IN CODE. BUT THAT CODE IS UNDERSTOOD AND INSIGHTS ACTION. BY THE FACT THAT NO MATTER WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES CONTRIBUTE NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY. THIS UNDERLYING SENSE THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT SURE RECALLS MAYBE WE'RE NOT REALLY REALLY WELCOME HERE BY EVERYBODY. AND WE KNOW AS AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY SAID THAT HATE CRIMES DON'T JUST IMPACT INDIVIDUAL VICTIMS. THAT THEY THEY HAVE A BROADER IMPACT ON THE TARGETED COMMUNITY ON OTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FOLKS THAT FEEL HATE AND ULTIMATELY ON THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. THAT IS OUR CLOCKS AND THEY ARE MEANT TO DIVIDE US AND THAT IS WHY ALLY SHIP AND PARTNERSHIP ARE SO ESSENTIAL HERE. I WOULD SAY ONE OF FOR ME IN MY SHORT TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL MOMENTS FOR ME. WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THE A. P. I. CAUCUS. AND ALL OF THE OTHER CAUCUSES IN OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP STOOD WITH THE JEWISH CAUCUS AFTER THE ATTACK THE DEADLY ATTACK. AGAINST THE SYNAGOGUE IN POWER. AND HOW MUCH THAT MEANT TO ME PERSONALLY AND HOW MUCH THAT MEANT TO OUR JEWISH CAUCUS AND HOW MUCH THAT MEANT TO THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO SEE ALL OF. THE OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. STAND BY OUR SIDE. AND pIMPORTANT THE API COMMUNITY FEEL THE SAME SENSE OF SUPPORT. I FEEL THE SAME SENSE OF ALLY SHIP. I HOPE THAT OUR API COLLEAGUES IN THE IF I COMMUTING THE STATE UNDERSTAND THAT WE IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. HAVE YOUR BACK. WE STAND STRONGLY WITH YOU. THAT WE DEEPLY VALUE YOU. THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE CALIFORNIA WITHOUT OUR INCREDIBLE API COMMUNITY. AND THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO TAKING ACTION TO PROTECT YOUR- AND WE KNOW TO THAT END WE KNOW THAT THAT FROM OUR STATE AUDITOR THAT HATE CRIMES ARE DRAMATICALLY UNDER REPORTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THIS SPIKE IN HATE THAT WE ARE SEEING AGAINST THE APEC COMMUNITY. THAT'S PROBABLY JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AS MUCH AS THOSE NUMBERS ARE JUMPED UP IN AN ALARMING RATE THAT IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AND WHAT THIS COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCING WHAT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE EXPERIENCING. AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT THE JEWISH CAUCUS HAS DECIDED THAT THIS SESSION WE WILL MAKE CONFRONTING HATE CRIMES ONE OF OUR LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE API CAUCUS AND ALL OF THE CAUCUSES IN THIS BUILDING TO ADVANCE MEANINGFUL LEGISLATION THAT WILL ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND I THINK THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS A STRONG AND IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THAT EFFORT SO I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING FORTH THIS RESOLUTION FOR SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF IT. I WANT TO REAFFIRM THE ALLY SHIP OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AND THE JEWISH CAUCUS AND I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK GABRIEL MISTER. BONTA YOUR- IN THE REAR THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY THREE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THE AUTHOR I DEEPLY. THIS BODY LOUDLY AND WITH ONE VOICE CONDEMNING AND DENOUNCING THESE UNACCEPTABLE ACTS OF HATE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST API. COMMUNITY AS OTHERS SPEAKERS HAVE ALREADY DETAILED API COMMUNITY MEMBERS. HAVE TO OFTEN BEEN VICTIMS OF THE IN A PHOBIA. OF OTHERING OF SCAPEGOATING AND PHYSICAL ATTACKS. INCLUDING TRAGICALLY MURDER IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN OAKLAND'S CHINATOWN WE'VE SEEN THE HORRIFIC AND THE VICIOUS AND GRAPHIC ATTACKS ON OUR- BELOVED ELDERS. THESE ATTACKS WE ALL KNOW ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND WE SIMPLY CANNOT AND WILL NOT TOLERATE THEM AS HAS BEEN STATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESTATE ALL COMMUNITIES ALL COMMUNITIES DESERVE TO BE SEEN.
