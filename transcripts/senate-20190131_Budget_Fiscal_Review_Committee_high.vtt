00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:49.976
IN A FEW MINUTES THE STATE CAN

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.577
CAN SOMETIMES GET QUITE A BIT OF

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:52.411
FEDERAL FUNDING --

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.980
DATE MINISTER THAT THEY ALSO

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.281
ADMINISTER KEEP PROGRAM CALLED

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.516
THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.185
ASSISTANCE ACT PROGRAM --

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.153
AND THAT FUNDS --

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:01.287
REPAIR AND REPAIR AND

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.288
REPLACEMENT OF PUBLIC

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:04.157
INFRASTRUCTURE AND REIMBURSES

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.658
SOME LOCAL COSTS SO.

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.960
THOSE ARE SOME CRITICAL OF

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:08.294
MORALS THAT --

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.162
YES PLACE.

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:10.763
IN TERMS OF FIRE ANOTHER

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.832
DISASTER RESPONSE THERE ARE A

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:16.602
FEW KEY DEPARTMENTS THERE --

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:17.236
THEY'VE DEPARTMENT FORESTRY AND

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:20.540
FIRE IN STATE --

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.941
DEPARTMENT INVOLVED IN FIRE

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.410
RESPONSE SO THEY'RE PRIMARILY

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:26.979
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE-RESPONSIBILITY AREAS THAT'S

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:29.348
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE STATE --

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:30.049
THAT THE STATE IS HER FIRST

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.617
MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.586
PROTECTING A MOST OF THAT IS

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.588
PRIVATE LANDS --

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:37.223
BUT THEY ALSO ARE JUST CRITICAL

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.691
IN GENERAL WITH REGARD TO FIRES.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:39.725
THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:40.860
DEPARTMENT IS ALSO --

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.628
AN IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT THAT CAN

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:43.563
BE --

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.864
HARNESS REALLY WHEN THERE'S A

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:46.599
NEED THEY CAN BRING TO BEAR A

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.835
LOT OF FEDERAL RESOURCES

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.069
MILITARY TYPES OF EQUIPMENT

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.737
AIRCRAFT FOR EXAMPLE BUT THEY

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.172
ALSO HAVE STAFF THAT CAN SERVE A

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:54.540
VARIETY OF ROLES IN HELPING TO

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.175
RESPOND.

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:57.977
AND RECOVER FROM DISASTERS.

00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.078
I'M ALSO JUST WANT TO MENTION OF

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.613
WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT WATER

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.247
RESOURCES WE DON'T THINK ABOUT

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.715
THEM VERY MUCH --

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:04.083
SOMETIMES IN CONTACT THE FIRES

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.451
BUT THEY CAN BE IMPORTANT THAT

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:06.652
CAN PROVIDE SANDBAGS IN THOSE

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:07.420
KINDS OF THINGS IF THERE'S GONNA

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:08.721
BE A MUD SLIDE.

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:09.255
BUT THEY ALSO ARE REALLY

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.823
IMPORTANT IF WE IF WE GET A

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.592
FLOOD EVENT AND THAT COURSE THE

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.493
STATE IS NOT JUST FROM THE FIRES

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.461
BUT WERE FOREIGN FRONT TO FLOODS.

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:18.464
EARTHQUAKES AND AND OTHER TYPES

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.166
OF DISASTERS AS WELL.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.601
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE --

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:22.568
TWO WE HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.636
DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED IN RECOVERY

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.605
ASSISTANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.540
TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL --

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:29.308
THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF FIRST --

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:30.810
ON THE GROUND IN TERMS OF

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:32.812
CLEANING UP THE DEBRIS THEY GET

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.347
ALL OF THE REALLY HAZARDOUS AND

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.015
TOXIC KINDS OF MATERIALS OF

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:37.383
THEIR PROPANE TANKS ARE AS BEST

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.751
AS THEY COME IN AND MAKE SURE

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.319
THAT THOSE ARE COLLECTED AFTER

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:43.022
FIRE RATHER MAJOR DISASTER --

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.724
SO THEY DON'T CONTAMINATE --

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.058
CONTAMINATE OUR BEAUTIFUL

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:49.262
ENVIRONMENT POWER CYCLE PAYS A

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.696
REALLY CRITICAL ROLE NAY THEY

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:51.664
ACTUALLY GET THE BULK OF THE

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:53.799
MATERIAL ASH THE CONCRETE THE

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.334
METALS AND THEY CLEAN THAT UP

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:56.168
AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:58.037
ABOUT THAT AND YOU KNOW WE'LL

00:08:58.104 --> 00:08:58.804
WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM COVER CYCLE

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.139
TODAY -- BUT

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.874
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:02.642
WITH REGARD TO FIRES IN

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.709
PARTICULAR --

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.278
ALSO JUST QUICKLY TO MENTION THE

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.412
DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THEY

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:07.880
ADMINISTER TEMPORARY SHELTERS

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.415
AND THEY ALSO RUN A PROGRAM THE

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:10.249
STATE HAD TO PROVIDE SOME

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:12.285
ADDITIONAL CASH ASSISTANCE TO

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:13.252
FOLKS -- ITS

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:15.922
IT'S ABOUT UP TO TEN THOUSAND

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.990
DOLLARS SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:20.559
FULLY MAKE PEOPLE WHOLE BUT IT

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:22.328
IS IS CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTION.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.963
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE WE

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.530
SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE STATE

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:25.564
FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED FOR

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.833
DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.501
I'M JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:30.836
THINGS SO CAL FIRE HAS A FACT

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.638
BASED BUDGET FOR FIRE CONTROL

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:33.806
RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT'S

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.408
USUALLY ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:36.542
A YEAR --

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:38.844
THEY ALSO HAVE A BASE BUDGET FOR

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.379
THEIR EMERGENCY FUNDS AND THAT'S

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:43.582
USED WHEN A FIRE INCIDENT EXCEED

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:44.884
THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:47.720
RESPONSE AND USUALLY THAT'S

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.789
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION.

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.090
SEVEN ADDITION --

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:52.091
YES ALSO HAS THE CDA PROGRAM

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:53.759
WHICH I REFERENCED --

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:54.894
PREVIOUSLY AND THEY HAVE A SET

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:55.861
UP FOR THAT PROGRAM.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:56.996
SO IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:57.697
THAT THERE ARE SOME BUDGET

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.265
MECHANISMS THAT THE STATE HAS

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.733
HISTORICALLY HAD TO MAKE MJOR

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.068
ADJUSTMENTS THIS IS PRETTY

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:03.436
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:04.570
WHEN THE NEXT DISASTER GOING TO

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.838
HIT AND WHAT LEVEL OF RESOURCES

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:06.739
WE'RE GONNA NEED AND WE NEED TO

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:07.440
MAKE BE.

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:07.974
ABLE TO MAKE CURRENT YEAR

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.875
ADJUSTMENTS --

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.777
OFTEN IF THERE IS A NEED TO ADD

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.546
A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:14.680
SO THERE THE E. FUND HAS A

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:16.349
PROVISION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:17.683
FINANCE CAN MAKE AUGMENTATIONS --

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.785
AND THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER ACCOUNT

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.988
AND I KNOW --

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:22.888
THIS IS ESTHER RESPONSE

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.924
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:25.491
THIS ACCOUNT ACTUALLY CENTS

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:26.625
ADDED -- AS

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.327
OF JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR --

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:29.929
BUT IT'S BEEN HAVE AN IMPORTANT

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.764
TOOL FOR THE STATE TO USE --

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.766
TO WHERE BY AGAIN --

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:34.800
THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:37.436
FINANCE CAN ALLOCATE FUNDS FROM

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:37.970
ONE OF THE STATE'S RESERVE

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.572
ACCOUNTS. TO PAY FOR

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.540
UNANTICIPATED COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.342
WITH DISASTERS.

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.977
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE --

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:46.078
FOUR WOULD PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:46.779
OF INFORMATION ON FEDERAL

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:48.047
FUNDING --

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.448
SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLAYS

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:50.416
A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.917
HELPING TO FIND DISASTER

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.619
RESPONSE AND RECOVERY COSTS IN

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:54.920
THE CASE OF A VERY MAJOR

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:55.988
DISASTER.

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:56.989
ON THERE ARE LOTS OF FEDERAL

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.891
PROGRAMS IN THE KEY THINGS THEY

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.793
FIND OUR RESPONSE --

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.728
DEBRIS REMOVAL REBUILDING PUBLIC

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.130
INFRASTRUCTURE --

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.598
THEY ALSO HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.266
THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.367
PROGRAM WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:08.934
ABOUT THAT AS PER THE THIRD

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.202
PANEL -- AND

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:11.737
THAT FIND SOME PROJECTS THAT CAN

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.305
REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:14.407
DISASTERS SO THAT'S AT THE KIND

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:16.042
OF INTERESTING AND HELPFUL

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.510
PROGRAM THAT THEY HOP TO HELP US

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:18.344
REBUILD.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.279
AND ALSO BE MORE RESILIENT AND

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.914
THE FUTURE.

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.049
I AM SO IN GENERAL THE STATE

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.917
GETS ABOUT A 75% COST YOU'RE

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:26.118
THAT KIND OF A RULE OF THUMB

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:27.453
THAT THE SEVENTY THAT THE FEDS

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.854
COME IN AND PAY ABOUT 75%.

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:32.158
IT'S NOT ALWAYS 75% IT CAN BE

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.726
MORE WE CAN SOME WE CAN REQUEST

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:34.827
A HIGHER LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:36.662
AND WE HAVE REQUESTED A HIGHER

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:37.663
LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT BOOK FOR

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.632
BOTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:40.433
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES.

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:44.003
I THINK WE REQUESTED A 100% FOR

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.271
CERTAIN CATEGORIES IN FOR I

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.440
THINK NINETY DAYS --

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:49.141
WE MAY OR MAY NOT GET THAT BUT

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.943
ALSO SOME ACTIVITIES ARE NOT

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.244
ELIGIBLE SO SOMETIMES THAT WE

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:54.447
CAN GET A LOWER REIMBURSEMENT --

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.115
SHARE IF ULTIMATELY SOME OF THE

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:58.217
ACTIVITIES WE UNDERTAKE AREN'T

00:11:58.284 --> 00:11:58.651
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.152
REIMBURSEMENT --

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.520
SO IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:04.223
THAT VOCALS TYPICALLY CONTRIBUTE --

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.791
IF IT'S IF THEIR LOCAL COST SO

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:08.260
USUALLY THERE'S A 75% FED CUP

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:09.361
FEDERAL COSTS CHAIR.

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:10.329
AND THEN THE STATE LOCAL THE

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.131
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT REMAINING

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:13.532
25% IF IT'S A STATE COST WE

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:16.368
PRODUCED THE FULL 25% THE LOCAL

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.337
COST THE STATE USUALLY COVERS

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.906
75% OF THAT 25% AND LOCALS COVER.

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:23.309
UP 25% OF THE 25% WHICH IS ABOUT

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.877
6% -- BUT

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:26.278

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:36.268
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:38.804
UNFORTUNATELY AS AS YOU ALL ARE

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.239

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:42.041
EVEN DESPITE ALL THE ACTIONS

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:44.843
THAT WE TOOK IN 200-017-2000 AND

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.845
EIGHTEEN WAS EVEN WORSE --

00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:47.479
IT WAS REALLY A VERY DEVASTATING

00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:50.416
YOU AND I KNOW WE'LL HEAR A LOT

MORE ABOUT THAT --

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:52.885
SO I'M NOT GOING TO A LOT O

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:55.454
DETAIL BUT THE CAMPFIRE WAS --

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.690
WAS EXTREMELY DEVASTATING A

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:00.225
PARTICULAR TO THE COMMUNITY

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.127
PARADISE ON THE WALL THE IN

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:03.896
HELL'S FIRES WERE ALSO VERY VERY

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:05.130
DESTRUCTIVE AND THERE WERE

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:07.433
OTHERS AS WELL AS WE HEARD SO --

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:08.901
IS REALLY DEVASTATING YEAR --

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.536
PAGE SIX HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:11.537
FINANCIAL --

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:12.671
PIECES I KNOW WE'LL HEAR MORE

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:13.872

PERSONAL PIECES SOON --

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:17.042
BUT THE STATE USE THAT TRIO A

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.477
PROCESS THAT I MENTIONS TO

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:19.778
ALLOCATE FUNDS IN THE CURRENT

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:22.114
YEAR. TO HELP ADDRESS RESPONSE

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:23.649
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:26.719
FIRES AND THE TABLE ON PAGE SIX

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:27.953
SUMMARIZES --

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.422
THAT FINANCIAL OUTLAY THAT THE

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.091
STATE MADE SO OR IS MAKING --

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.559
SO YOU'LL SEE A FEW THINGS JUST

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:34.993
THE BOTTOM LINE NUMBERS ARE

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.428
PRETTY STRIKING --

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:38.597
OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS AN

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:39.965
ESTIMATED COSTS IN TERMS OF

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.438
DISASTERS.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.207
WE DO ANTICIPATE BUT THE THE

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:49.274
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL MEMBERS

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:49.942
ARE QUITE A BIT --

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:51.176
SO THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:53.345
ESTIMATE THEY'RE ESTIMATING --

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.680
75% OF ELIGIBLE COSTS OF COURSE

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.349
THAT COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER --

00:16:57.416 --> 00:17:00.552
BUT I'M EVEN WITHOUT MILLION

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:02.454
DOLLARS WORTH OF STATE NAT COSTS

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:03.889
THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT'S QUITE

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:05.357
SUBSTANTIAL --

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:06.258

IN THIS IS ACTUALLY A CONDENSED

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:11.530

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:12.097
THEY'RE ACTUALLY EVEN MORE

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:13.432
DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE OTHER

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:14.366

OF DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED --

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.271
BUT YOU'LL ALSO NOTICE BY FAR

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:22.508
THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL ACTIVITY IN

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.877
TERMS OF COST IS DEBRIS REMOVAL --

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:26.578
SAID THE DEBRIS REMOVAL COSTS

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:28.013

QUITE LARGE --

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:32.551
WELL OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.221

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.702
IMPACT.

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:41.872
WE CAN THEN BUILD AROUND THAT --

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:43.173

OF IT SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO

00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:55.619

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:53.069
BUILT ON A REMOVAL OF THE DEBRIS.

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.471
SO FOR THOSE OF US AND URBAN AND

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:56.105
SUBURBAN.

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:58.508
AREAS WE WE KIND OF WONDER WHY

00:57:58.575 --> 00:58:00.009
WITH THE STATE HAVE TO COME IN.

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:02.045
AND REMOVE DEBRIS FROM THESE

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:04.547
WILDFIRES OWNS AND AYE AYE AYE

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:06.015
AND ALWAYS WILL BE CLINICAL ICE

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:07.584
WHEN TRYING TO THE DEFINITION OF

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:08.718
MAYBE THE HISTORY OF HOW.

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:12.088
THAT STARTED IN WHY A EVERYONE

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:14.023
IS RESPONSIBLE.

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.658
FOR AIN'T THROUGH THEIR TAXES

00:58:15.725 --> 00:58:18.595
FOR FOR THIS SERVICE --

00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:20.430
FALL INTO THE PART I CAN I MIGHT

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:22.265
DEFERRED TO DIRECTOR GO DUE TO

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:24.100
FOR PART OF THE CENTER AS WELL --

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.201
THE COST PER DEBRIS REMOVAL

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:26.870
GENERALLY EXCEED THE COMPONENTS

00:58:26.936 --> 00:58:28.504
OF THE INSURANCE THAT ARE

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.639
ALLOTTED FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL WE

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:31.207
DO RECOVER THAT COMPONENT UNDER

00:58:31.274 --> 00:58:32.876
INSURANCE THAT IS A LOT OF FOR

00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:35.078
DEBRIS REMOVAL --

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:35.812
I'M GONNA.

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:37.780
WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUEST FOR

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.315
ASSISTANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:42.018
AND IF I WOULD I WOULD DEFER TO

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:45.488
TRADITION.

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:47.557
SO CENTER I THINK ON THE THE

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:49.792
CASE BY CASE SOMEBODY WAS HOME

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:50.760
BURNS DOWN AND THEIR FIRE

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:54.497
INSURANCE TYPICALLY HANDLED BY.

00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:56.366
HOWEVER THE INSURANCE COMPANY I

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:58.301
HIRES -- IS

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:00.270
THE THE NORMAL PROCESS FOR A

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:02.538
CASE BY CASE EVEN A MODERATELY

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:03.673
SMALL MAYBE A COUPLE HOMES.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.474
BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.276
KIND OF OF FIRE IMPACTS THE

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:07.877
LOSSES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN --

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:09.078
HERE --

00:59:09.145 --> 00:59:10.513
THESE EVENTS RESULT IN A COUPLE

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.347
THINGS FIRST OF ALL THEY RESULT

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:13.583
IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:16.819
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAKE THE

00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:18.321
CAMPFIRE FOR EXAMPLE --

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.156
MOST OF THESE HOMES WERE BUILT

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:21.624
IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES THE

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:23.526
APP'S BEST THIS AND OTHER KINDS

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:24.827
OF HOUSES MATERIALS IN THEM.

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:27.864
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT --

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:29.432
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A MASSIVE AMOUNT

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:30.900
OF LOSSES LIKE THAT IT'S A VERY

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:32.402
LEVEL OF SOME PEOPLE ARE UNDER

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:34.804
SURE SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT INSURED --

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.372
AND ULTIMATELY IT IS IN THE BEST

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:37.840
INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:40.176
AND SAFETY FOR THE STATE.

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:44.347
TO COME IN AND OF WORK TO REMOVE

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:45.481
FIRST OF ALL --

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:46.950
IDENTIFY ALL THE HOUSEHOLD

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:48.718
HAZARDOUS WASTE PAINS PASSED THE

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:51.321
SIDES -- ALL

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:52.455
OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE YOU

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:53.823
KNOW PROPANE.

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.491
AND GET THOSE OFF OF THE WAY

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.093
DISPOSE OF THEM APPROPRIATELY

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.828
AND THEN COME IN --

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.630
AND AND BEGIN THE PROCESS OF

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:01.898
DOING THE DEBRIS REMOVAL

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.366
ULTIMATELY THOUGH I HAVE TO TELL

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.133
YOU THAT EACH AND EVERY

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.768
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER WATCH WE

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:06.803
START --

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:11.274
THAT FACE TO OF DEBRIS REMOVAL

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:13.676
UP TO THE HOMEOWNER THEMSELVES

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.244
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE THEY

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:16.646
WANTED A STEP INTO THE

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:19.682
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM OR NOT. 99% A

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:22.285
TIME THEY THEY ALL DO BECAUSE IT

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:23.486
IS -- IT IS

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:24.887
THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.255
WAY OF DOING IT --

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:28.691
IF THERE ARE INSURANCE PROCEEDS

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.393
THAT -- ARE

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.761
NOT TIED TO YOU TO THAT

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:34.330
INDIVIDUALS INSURANCE --

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:39.602
PACKAGE THAT CALLS FOR DEBRIS.

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.204
WHEN WE MAKE THIS CLEAR TO THEM

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.871
AND THEY FIND THE RIGHT OF ENTRY

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:42.672
FORM WHILE WE WORK WITH THE

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:44.007
COUNTY TO GO IN AND PULL BACK

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:44.674
THOSE?

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:45.341
THOSE SECTIONS OF THE INSURANCE

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:46.909
PROCEEDS THAT ARE DESIGNATED FOR

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.845
DEBRIS CLARENCE TO REIMBURSE THE

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:49.679
GOVERNMENT.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:52.315
SO ULTIMATELY IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.783
IT'S ABOUT REALLY HEALTH AND

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.485
SAFETY THE SECOND PIECE IS

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:57.387
ECONOMIC RECOVERY THE SOONER WE

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:57.987
CAN GET --

01:00:58.054 --> 01:00:59.689
THESE COMMUNITIES CLEARED OF A

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:01.057
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FIRE DEBRIS

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.425
THE SOONER THAT COMMUNITY CAN

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.893
GET BACK UP ONLINE.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.129
REBUILDING CAN START TAX BASE

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:07.864
CAN START TO BE GENERATED AND

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:10.233
THAT BACK COMMUNITY CAN CAN MOVE

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:11.434
FORWARD.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.936
OFFICE POINT TO US IS THE CINEMA

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:16.773
COUNTY AND AND JUST ABOUT A YEAR

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:21.210
AFTER THE 5% REBUILT.

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:22.345
AND THAT IS REALLY BECAUSE WE

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.113
RAPIDLY WHEN AND WERE ABLE TO

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.449
MOVE OUT WE KNOW HISTORICALLY

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.551
THAT IF LEFT UP TO EACH AND

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:30.420
EVERY PERFECTLY THAT SIZE OF A

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:31.087
DISASTER.

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.555
THAT THAT WE WOULD SIT THERE FOR

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:33.523
YEARS BEFORE IT GETS THEN IT

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:35.258
GOES TO THE COUNTY HAS TO GET

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.526
INTO ABATEMENT PROGRAM

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.261
ULTIMATELY IT BECOMES ANOTHER

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.063
FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR THE COUNTY.

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:41.531
THEREBY EXASPERATING THE

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.266
INABILITY TO DO GOOD ECONOMIC

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:45.101
RECOVERY AND GET BACK GOING

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:45.902
AGAIN.

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:48.104
SO AND ME TO SAY THAT THAT AT

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:49.839
ANY TIME DEPENDS ON ON THE

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:51.974
COUNTIES EACH COUNCIL DIFFERENT.

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.844
IN THE CASE OF SANTA'S SAN DIEGO

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.412
LAST YEAR DURING DURING THE THE

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:57.780
I THINK WAS THE WEST FIRE.

01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:59.282
THE COUNTY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:00.616
TO ALSO STEP IN AND DO THE

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.819
DEBRIS AND WE WORK WITH US ON

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.520
SOME COST REIMBURSEMENT THINGS

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:05.888
SO IF THE COUNTY HAS THE ABILITY

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.290
AND MANY COUNTIES LIKE TO DO

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:09.192
THAT IF IT'S A MANAGEABLE SIZE

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:10.193
DISASTER.

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.461
BUT WE'RE SEEING THE CHI

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:12.695
DISASTERS WE'VE BEEN SEEING THEM

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.864
IT REALLY IS A A VERY MASSIVE

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.599
FILES SORT OF RECOVERY.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.301
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO BE

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:20.103
CLINICAL ABOUT IT NOT AND

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:23.773
UNEMOTIONAL BECAUSE CERTAINLY

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.707
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.342
THE THE ISSUE IS.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.644
WE'RE STILL BUILDING.

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:30.646
AND WILDFIRES OWNS AND I HAVE

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:31.347
THE MY COUNTY.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.381
LAGUNA BEACH CERTAINLY HAD A

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:36.552
MASSIVE CONFLAGRATION IN NINETY

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:37.153

I'M JUST SITTING HERE OKAY WE

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:46.362
DID LEARN SOME THINGS OVER THE

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:47.497
YEARS LIKE DON'T YOU SHAKE

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:48.831
GROUPS ANYMORE --

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.134
BUT I IS THERE.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.068

INSURANCE RATES IN THE IN THE

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:21.264
WALL THEM BERMAN AND INTERFACE

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.932
IN THOSE HIGH INTENSITY ZONES --

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:25.034
HAVE GONE UP --

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:27.737

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.375
FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR FOR

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:33.409
ANY KIND OF DISASTER

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.844
INDIVIDUALLY SHOULD PROTECT YOUR

PROGRAM THERE STRICTLY --

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.359
BUT THE REALITY IS IS THAT THOSE

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:51.627
INSURANCE RATES ARE HIGHER IN

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:52.361
THOSE AREAS LET ME ALSO STATE

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.330
THAT -- THAT

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:56.199
THE BUILDING CODES THAT WE DID

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:57.833
THAT WE CALIFORNIA HOUSE FOR FOR

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.068

THE WORLD AND THAT KIND OF THING

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:05.374
THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.710
CAN'T AND SHOULDN'T AND WON'T.

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.779
DO MORE IN THAT AREA WHICH WHICH

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.047
WE'VE BEEN WHICH WE'VE BEEN

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:12.648
TALKING ABOUT AND AND LOOKING AT

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:13.816
TRYING TO FIND.

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:16.219
OTHER PROGRAMS IN OTHER WAYS TO

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:17.853
INCREASE THAT RESILIENCY

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.755
CAPABILITY ALONG IT'S MORE THAN

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:20.990
JUST DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLEARING

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:22.525
IT IS REALLY WHAT IS YOUR

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:23.693
STRUCTURE LOOK LIKE.

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.628
AND MAYBE THAT'S THROUGH --

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.030
INCENTIVES TO DO RETROFITTING

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.999
FOR HOMEOWNERS WORKING MORE WITH

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.667
THE ENSURE I'D LIKE TO SEE THE

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:32.201
INSURANCE COMPANIES QUITE

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:34.203
FRANKLY COME TO THE TABLE MORE

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:37.006

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.107
TAKING SOME INTEREST MONEY THAT

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.275
YOU'RE MAKING AND PUTTING IT

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:40.710
INTO A MITIGATION PROGRAM THAT

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:41.611
COULD.

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.145
COULD COULD MATCH --

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.180
MAYBE MATCH THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:45.748
LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T MATCH --

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:48.517
WITH STATE DOLLARS OR OR DO A

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:53.556
PROGRAM A GRANT TO THE HOMEOWNER

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:54.523
AND IF THE HOMEOWNER DOES IT.

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:56.325
THEN BRING DOWN THEIR INSURANCE

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.794
PREMIUMS MAYBE 20% --

01:04:58.861 --> 01:04:59.929

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.430
THERE OF A OF A OF THE BENEFIT

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:02.865
BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE SOMETHING

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.500
POSITIVE TO BUY DOWN THE RISK OF

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.335
THE OF THE DISASTER WE'VE DONE

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:07.536
THIS IN THE EARTHQUAKE AREA AND

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.105
IS PROVING TO BE.

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.373
PRETTY POSITIVE AND I I THINK

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:12.375
THAT'S AN AREA WE NEED.

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.643

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:44.440
SOME MIGHT THING TO WORRY ABOUT

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:45.274
I JUST DAHLE I'M A ONE THE FIRE

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:48.010
DEPARTMENT COMES BUT IN DISASTER.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:48.877
AS WE SEEN.

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:51.146
WHEN YOU DIAL 911- YOU MAY NOT

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:51.714
GET THOSE FIREFIGHTERS RIGHT

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.381
AWAY?

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.216
THEY MAY NOT COME FOR A FEW

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:56.952
HOURS OR MAYBE A DAY BECAUSE

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:58.287
WE'RE IN A STATEWIDE RED FLY

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:59.955
CONDITION AND WE'VE GOT.

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:01.490
A MAJOR CATASTROPHE IN THE NORTH

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.025
PULLING RESOURCES IN A MAJOR

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.627
CATASTROPHE THE SOUTH FULLY

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:06.729
RESOURCES.

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:08.397
MUCH MOST OF THE STATION SEVEN

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.965
BROWNED OUT.

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:10.933
AND AND THERE'S JUST A WERE

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.202
RESOURCES IMMEDIATELY.

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.137
SO PART OF PREPAREDNESS.

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.139
HIS FIRST IN WORKING TO GET

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:20.009
INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN BUILDING

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:20.876
EMPOWERING THEMSELVES AND

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.277
BUILDING A CAPABILITY THE SECOND

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.847
THING IS THEN WORKING WITH OUR

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:28.717
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS --

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.853
TO TO UNDERSTAND THAT EMERGENCY

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:33.389
MANAGEMENT IT IT'S IT'S A

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:35.591
COMPLEX BUSINESS AND IT'S NOT

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:36.825
JUST ABOUT.

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:38.093
RESPONDING AT PUTTING THE WET

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.662
STUFF ON THE REST OF IT IS.

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:42.598
IT IS IS PRE EVENT MITIGATION.

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:44.266
THE ABILITY TO PREPARE THE

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.735
COMMUNITY AND HARDEN IT. TO DO

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:49.004
GOOD ANALYSIS OF OF THE THREATS

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:50.506
THAT THEY FACE FIRST WHAT THE

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:51.774
RECOGNIZED THE THREATS.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.709
AND THEN AND THEN PUT MITIGATION

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:54.710
EFFORTS IN AND THAT MEANS

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:56.178
LEVERAGING EVERY MEDICATION

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:58.447
DOLLARS THAT MEANS OUR LOCAL.

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:00.249
ELECTED BODIES NEED TO

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:03.318
PRIORITIZE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:04.319
AND MEDICATION AS A AS A P. A

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:06.088
FACTOR AND IT ALSO GOES DOWN

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.022
INTO OUR LOCAL PLANNING

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:09.091
COMMISSIONS WHICH WHICH AS THEY

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.693
BUILD OUT COMMUNITIES.

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:11.994
THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT WHAT

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.562
IF IS THAT COMMUNITY RESILIENT

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:16.031
ENOUGH TO A DISASTER OKAY AND

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.466
THEN FROM THAT.

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:22.371
BUILDING IN ENOUGH CAPACITY OF

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.940
AFTER YEARS OF OF DOWNTURN IN

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.575
ECONOMICS EXCEPT FOR A WHILE WE

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.110
STILL HAVE FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:28.744
LAW ENFORCEMENT OF THE PUBLIC

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.112
SAFETY ENTITIES.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:30.846
THAT HAVE NOT COME UP TO FULL

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.648
SPEED YET AND HAVE RESOURCE

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:34.183
ISSUES RIGHT --

01:12:34.249 --> 01:12:35.651
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THERE WE HAVE

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:37.820
EMERGENCY MANAGERS IT'S ALL OVER

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.621
THE MAP IN CALIFORNIA SUMMER

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.824
LOCATED BURIED IN THE DEPARTMENT

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:44.093
OF HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:46.028
SUMMER IN THE CEO'S OFFICE IT'S

IT RUNS THE GAMUT --

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.198
AND SO WE NEED TO RAISE THE

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:51.366
STATURE OF THAT ROLE SO THAT

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:53.168
THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL --

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:55.771
CAN ACTUALLY HELP THE COMMUNITY

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.272
RECOGNIZED THE THREATS BEYOND

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:59.108
THE TRADITIONAL FIRE IN AND LAW

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:00.609

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:03.979
CAN I JUMP IN JAIL JUST TO HELP

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:04.480
SORRY I THOUGHT IT WAS A

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:05.881
COMPLICATED ANSWER IT.

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.850
WAS SO THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.051
DEFINES ME READING IS FOR

THE SORT OF TWO AND A HALF FOR

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:15.624
ONE AND A HALF STRATEGY TO MAJOR --

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.293
WARS AT THE SAME TIME AS WELL AS

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.728
THREE SMALL ARMED CONFLICTS IS

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.563
SORT OF THE STANDARD WORKING

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:23.465
DEFINITION OF RATING IS TO

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:27.936
DEPARTMENT DEFENSE DO YOU GET TO

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.404
THAT SORT OF QUANTITATIVE.

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.173
THINKING I I I GET THE SORT OF

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.374
THE THE HOLISTIC THINKING BUT

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:32.975
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS IF

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.309
THERE'S SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN A

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:37.713
SANTA CRUZ COUNTY I HAVE THREE

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.047
MAJOR --

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:41.216
MAJOR FIRE DISASTERSAT THE SAME

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.152
TIME -- YOU

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.620
KNOW WITH YOU ANALYZE THOSE

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:46.655
COUNTIES RESOURCES LIKE TO DO WE

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:48.490
HAVE THE I MEAN THE USER DEFINED

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.459
IN LIKE IF WE HAVE FOUR TO TIME

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.294
AND TWO SMALL ARE WE READY WITH

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.829
AN EARTHQUAKE ON TOP LIKE HOW

HOW DO YOU SORT OF DO THAT

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:56.965
SIMPLE.

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:58.967
SNOT SIMPLE MATH SO THAT'S

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.335
THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN I

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:01.904

SORT.

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:10.846
OF DOING THE OVERALL MATH HERE

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:11.613
ON WHAT.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.848
WE DO DO WE DO HAVE A VERY

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:14.817
SIMILAR --

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:17.553
CONSTRUCT WHERE WE CAN WE HAVE

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.721
TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AT

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.657
LEAST TO WHAT WE CALL LEVEL --

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:22.491
ONE THOSE ARE CATASTROPHIC

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.226
EVENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE

STATE AND ALL AND THEN A LEVEL --

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:30.098
TO AND SO YOU HAVE GOT TO LEVEL

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:32.000
ONE LEVEL TWO AND LEVEL TWO IS

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:32.601
JUST YOU KNOW IT'S NOT

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.236
NECESSARILY. FOR THE CUTS A BAD

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.839
DAY BUT IT'S IT'S NOT

IT'S IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE ALL

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:49.952
HANDS ON TRAINING TO TO ENSURE

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.587
THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY.

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:55.090
DO THAT THE THAT THAT'S THE

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:55.357

WE'RE WOLSEY IN CAMP BOTH LEVEL

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:02.164
ONES YES SO DURING THAT THAT

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:03.699
INCIDENT WHO WHO AND WE AND

MODESTY THOUGH --

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:08.737
SORT OF LEADING IN BEING

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.706
STRETCHED THIN WE WEREN'T PRE

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.040

BILLION DOLLAR TAB IF THE FEDS

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.348
ARE GENEROUS ENOUGH TO KEEP HELP

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.083
IN FOR THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

WE'RE NOT.

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:55.677
CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED IN THAT FOR

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:57.546
ALL THESE OTHER CRUCIAL

MAYBE INGO IN JUMP IN THAT I LA --

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:18.433
I MEAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHT ON

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.602
THAT.

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.371
ONE TOP PROVIDE SOME INITIAL

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:23.939
COMMENTS IN MY COLLEAGUES AS

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.741
COMPUTERS IT'S IT'S HERE ALSO

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:26.475
AND SHE CAN PROVIDE SOME

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:27.342
COMMENTS ON THAT.

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.143
HELLFIRE SIDE --

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:29.177
BUT IN TERMS SAID THAT THE

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:30.645
STATE'S BUDGETARY READY DAYS --

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:31.646
WE DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT RESERVE

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.415
FIND WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.717
I'M TAKING QUITE A BIT OF ACTION

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:36.985
TO REALLY --

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:37.552
REALLY PROVIDE SOME FUNDING

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:38.754
THERE AND BASICALLY WE'VE BEEN

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.523
USING THAT TO HELP TO HELP US --

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.391
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:43.725
UNANTICIPATED COSTS AND IT'S

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:44.826
BEEN VERY VERY VALUABLE --

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:46.228
IT PROBABLY IS WORTH US THINKING

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.596
ABOUT YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE HOW

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:49.131
MUCH THAT SHOULD BE IF IT'S

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:50.532
GOING TO ACTUALLY --

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:51.600
OF COURSE --

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.668
SERVICE AS AS BOTH SORT OF A

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:56.471
SELF INSURANCE FOR SOME OF THESE

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.173
MAJOR DISASTERS IN HELPING US

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.074
THAT WE NEED TO IS CASH FLOW

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:00.842
NEEDS AS WELL AS BUDGETARY

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:01.576
RESILIENCE OF THOSE ARE THE

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:02.511
KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS I THINK

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:04.346
WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE --

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:08.917
BUT THANKFULLY WE'VE BEEN AND

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:11.553
ALSO WOULD HAVE GOOD BUDGET

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.021
SITUATION --

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:14.823
THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR AND AND

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.425
THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN IN

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:17.926
ALLOWING US TO MAKE THESE KINDS

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:19.428
OF EXPENDITURE SO I THINK IT'S A

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.430
CONTINUING CONVERSATION --

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:22.564
WE DON'T HAVE LIKE A RAINY DAY

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:24.399
FUND IN THE SAME WAY FOR THIS WE

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:26.034
SORT OF SET ASIDE OUT OF OTHER

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:27.235
RESERVES TO GET READY BUT IF THE

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:28.236
BUDGET TAKES A TURN AND WE'RE

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:29.438
NOT LOOKING THAT GOOD IN TO OR

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:31.206
THREE YEARS BUT THE FIRES

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:31.740
ACTUALLY GET WORSE THAN.

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:32.641
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.209
EXACTLY RIGHT SO WE DON'T HAVE A

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:35.911
DESIGNATED RESERVE IT'S JUST FOR

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:37.946
DISASTERS INSTEAD WE WERE USING

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:40.916
OUR OUR SIR GENERAL RESERVE FUND --

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:42.217
TO HELP US ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:43.985
FISCAL CHALLENGES WE HAVE HAD

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.287
DISASTERS --

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:47.022
SO I THINK IT IS WORTH HAVING A

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:47.989
CONVERSATION ABOUT --

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.257
HOW HOW WHAT WE WANT THOSE

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:51.093
RESERVE LEVELS TO BE TO INSURE

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.761
THAT WE CAN HAVE IT MEET THOSE

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:53.395
NEEDS AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:54.196
AND CERTAINLY?

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:56.364
YOU KNOW WE MAY NOT WANT TO

01:18:56.431 --> 01:18:58.300
DRIVE DOWN THAT RESERVE FOLEY --

01:18:58.366 --> 01:18:59.734
BECAUSE IN YOUR EVEN WHEN WE

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:01.803
HAVE A AND ECONOMIC KIND OF

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:03.905
STRESS IN OUR IN OUR STATE

01:19:03.972 --> 01:19:04.806
BECAUSE WE WANT.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:05.574
TO YOU TO THINK THAT WE HAVE THE

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.676
SYSTEM WE DO WILL PROBABLY WANT

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:10.011
TO HAVE SOME CUSHION THERE --

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.346
FOR THE EVENT THAT WE HAVE SOME

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.215
MAJOR DISASTER COSTS I'M SO I

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:13.882
THINK THOSE ARE CUT CONVERSATION

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.050
THEIR OFFICE WOULD BE VERY

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:17.119
INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO HAVE.

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:20.755
A WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND I'M

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:24.526
CERTAINLY VERY.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.962
I'M JUST IN TERMS OF FIRE

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:29.030
ANALYSTS ARE FAVORITE TO LOOK

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:30.432
OVER YOUR SHOULDER ALL AREA.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:31.399
BUT IT AND SO I AM I WOULD ALSO

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:35.403
KNOW IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL-READING IS THAT AND THE BUDGET --

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:36.705
DOES INCLUDE A HIGHER AND NOW

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:38.140
I'VE SORT OF BE SLAIN BUDGETED

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.808
AMOUNT FOR THAT YOU FIND --

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.042
AND THAT'S JUST A FUNCTION OF

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.410
LOOKING AT HOW THAT YOU FIND

01:19:42.477 --> 01:19:43.578
COSTS HAVE BEEN GROWING IN

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:45.447
RECENT YEARS AND SO THERE IS

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:46.181
SOME --

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:48.383
PLANNING AHEAD FOR POTENTIALLY

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:48.783
HIGHER --

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:51.219
COSTS ON THE FIRE RESPONSE SIDE

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:52.621
ON IN TERMS OF THE MULTI YEAR WE

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:53.688
CAN TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT

01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:55.223
MORE ON THE NEXT PANEL BUT I

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.825
THINK IT GETS TO THE HEART OF

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:57.459
SOME YOUR QUESTION SENATOR STERN

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.260
HAVE --

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:00.162
LOOKING OUT WAIT WHAT IS THE

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:01.596
IDEAL LEVEL OF READINESS OR

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.331
RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS AND

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:04.199
AND SO -- WE

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:05.567
CAN TALK ABOUT IT MORE BUT ONE

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.801
OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MAY WANT

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:07.569
TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:08.470
THINKING ABOUT THIS WHOLE

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:10.438
PACKAGE OF HOW DO WE RESPOND TO

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:13.141
WILDFIRES AND DISASTERS IS --

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:13.708
EIGHTEEN THE ADMINISTRATION

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:14.743
HASN'T PUT FORWARD AN ASSESSMENT

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:17.045
RECENTLY OF WHAT THE CAPACITY IS

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:18.713
OF STATE AND LOCAL SYSTEMS

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.949
COMBINED ON IF THERE'S ANY GAPS

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.117
AND SAID YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:24.619
AUGMENTING RESOURCES ADDING FIRE

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:25.554
ENGINES ADDING.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.689
AN AIR RESOURCES I YOU MAY WANT

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:29.291
TO HAVE MORE OF AN ASSESSMENT

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:30.592
LIKE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS VERY

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.794
LIKELY NOT GOING TO BE A ONE

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:33.595
YEAR --

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.996
THING OF INCREASING RESOURCES

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.565
WE'VE DONE IN RECENT YEARS IT'S

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:37.999
VERY LIKELY TO CONTINUE THAT

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:40.202
TREND IN FUTURE YEARS AS WE HAVE

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:41.803
THESE VERY AS SEVERE FIRE

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.104
SEASONS AND SO.

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:44.739
I YOU MAY WANT TO THINK MORE

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:47.475
ABOUT IT A MULTI YOUR STRATEGY

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:49.811
WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THE NEXT.

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:52.047
OKAY THANKS CAN I JUST SAY ONE

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:54.883
THING PLEASE ARE SO.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:21:00.622
KEEP IN MIND THAT OVER THE

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.023
COURSE OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:06.094
MYSTERY IT'S IN THE OVER ARCHING

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.262
PREPAREDNESS LEVEL RIGHT YOU

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:08.763
KNOW WHETHER IT'S TECHNOLOGY

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:10.465
WHETHER IT'S MEETING WE HAVE WE

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.367
FINALLY MET THE LAST YEAR THE

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:13.235
BLUE RIBBON.

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:15.403
FIRE COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.038
ON THE NUMBER OF OF WE ASK

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.907
ENGINES THAT NEEDED TO BE PUT IN

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:20.475
THE SYSTEM THAT'S A AUGMENTING

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.177
FORCE THAT IS BE A ABOVE AND

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:24.079
BEYOND THE EXISTING AND WE ARE

01:21:24.145 --> 01:21:25.947
NOW MEETING THAT.

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.582
THAT IS THAT THE NEXT STEP IS TO

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:28.416
GO BACK AND RE EVALUATE IS THAT

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:29.751
GIVEN THE CURRENT THREAT WE

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:31.486
CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:32.454
THE NEXT STEP.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.588
BUT I THINK THE USE OF

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.056
TECHNOLOGY --

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:38.326
BETTERTO HELP BY DOWN THE RISK --

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:41.696
BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'LL TAKE IT

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:42.464
TAKE A PAGE OUT A HOMELAND

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:43.298
SECURITY --

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:45.834
YOU CAN YOU CAN SPEND BILLIONS

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.202
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ON

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:48.737
RESOURCES AND ARE STILL GOING TO

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:50.205
BE A SECURITY THREAT SO.

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:52.240
IT'S ALL IN HOW YOU BEST UTILIZE

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.509
THAT TO TO MOVE US FORWARD I

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:55.110
THINK THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:57.479
AREAS WE CAN AND I AND I LOVE

01:21:57.545 --> 01:22:00.582
THAT FRAME BECAUSE IT.

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:01.750
I TO GETTING THAT MATH TIGHT FOR

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:02.984
US ON BUDGET COMMITTEE SO WE CAN

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:03.618
ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND OKAY WE'RE

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:04.452
MAKING A BILLION DOLLAR

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:06.254
INVESTMENT BUT ACTUALLY GET ME

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.489
JUST LIKE WE DO ON FIND OUT

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:09.024
PENSION LIABILITIES ARE DEBTS

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:09.924
RIGHT YOU'RE ACTUALLY.

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.026
YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY TO SAVE

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.127
MONEY RIGHT THIS WORKS ON

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.328
INFRASTRUCTURE IT HAPPENS AND

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:14.896
HEALTHCARE SORT OF LOOKING AT

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.364
THOSE ARE LONG TERM OUTCOME FOR

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.400
RIGHT NOW IT FEELS.

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:21.136
A LITTLE BIT LIKE.

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:21.970
BUT WE'RE NOT QUANTIFYING THE

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:23.872
PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING EVEN LIKE

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:24.773
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO CAPTURE THOSE

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.107
METRICS ACCURATELY IN A WAY I

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:27.542
KNOW IT'S A ROUGH SCIENCE HERE

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.576
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET TO A POINT

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.045
WHERE LIKE PERFECTLY QUANTIFIED

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.246
OF EXACTLY WHAT IS.

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:33.081
RATING IS MEAN OR EXACTLY HOW

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:34.783
MUCH RISK AND WE BOUGHT DOWN AND

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:36.117
WILDFIRES ARE INHERENTLY CHAOTIC

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:37.485
THAT'S WHAT NATURAL DISASTERS

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:38.687
ARE RIGHT THERE UNPREDICTABLE

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.455
AND SOMEWHAT ACTS OF GOD OR THE

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:41.790
WERE CONTRIBUTING TO IT NOW

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:44.059
GIVEN OUR FOSSIL FUEL PATTERNS

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:47.796
BUT YEAH.

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:50.432
LET'S LET'S START TIGHTER SO

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:51.299
WHEN.

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.301
HOW MUCH RISK ARE WE BUYING DOWN

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:55.370
RIGHT WHAT COST SAVINGS ARE WE

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:57.105
GENERATING FOR THE STATE WITH?

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:59.107
EITHER HOME HARDENING A SMARTER

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:01.576
INSURANCE POSTURE GETTING MORE

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.678
LOCAL COORDINATION SOME OF THESE

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:05.613
SUBPOENAS TO ADVANCE SUPPRESSION

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.449
EFFORTS PRESCRIBED BURNS RIGHT

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:08.583
CERTAIN THAT THEY ALL SORT OF

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.218

DOES THE FIRST A COUPLE OF

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:48.042
OBSERVATIONS.

SOMETIMES WE GET PRETTY

01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:52.280
DISGUSTED ABOUT SOCIETY. ONE OF

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:53.815
THE VERY INTERESTING THINGS TO

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:55.650
ME AND I LOOK AT YOUR MAP THERE

01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:58.386
THE OUT OF STATE RESOURCES.

01:25:58.453 --> 01:25:59.888
DURING THE FIRE PARTICULARLY

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:01.356
WHEN IT WAS RAGING.

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:03.925
BEING UP THERE ON SITE. ONE OF

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.393
THE THINGS IT WAS INSTRUCTIVE TO

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.762
ME THE AMOUNT OF COMMENTS FROM

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:10.331
OUT OF STATE RESPONDERS WHO SAID

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:11.566
THAT THEY'VE BEEN RESPONDING ALL

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:14.502
OVER AMERICA KATRINA YOU NAME IT.

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.004
TO EMERGENCIES THEY SAID WE HAVE

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:17.539
NEVER SEEN THE OUTPOURING OF

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:20.408
SUPPORT. FOR A COMMUNITY THAT

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:22.043
WE'RE SEEING HERE.

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:23.344
AND THAT WAS MANIFESTED IN MANY

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.946
WAYS.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.814
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GIVES US A

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.483
LITTLE BIT OF HOPE.

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:30.184
ANOTHER OBSERVATION WHICH WILL

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:32.120
APPLY TO OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:34.756
AS WELL AND THAT IS MANAGING THE

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:37.158
FORCE IN THE WILD PLANTS.

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:38.192
POST FIRE.

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:39.561
AS ONE UP THERE THE FIRST THING

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.796
THAT REALLY STRUCK ME.

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:44.532
WAS A LARGE TREES.

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:48.002
SCORCHED BUT THE LORD BARK.

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:51.739
MAYBE TWELVE FEET UP MAYBE LESS.

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:53.074
BUT THE CANOPIES LARGELY

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:57.445
UNTOUCHED. NINE FORESTER BY THE

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:58.513
HAD TO BE A PRODUCT OF PARTLY

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:01.649
THE AMOUNT OF ACCUMULATED FUEL.

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:03.818
AVAILABLE TO THE FIRE

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:04.118
[inaudible]

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:06.154
THE WINDS.

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.488
AND THEN THE CANYONS.

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:10.758
THE CHANNEL THOSE.

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:12.627
THAT WAS THE ONLY GOOD THING

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.329
THAT I SAW OF THAT.

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:16.998
IS THE CHARACTER OF THAT RICH

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.000
AND IT'S NOT JUST PARADISE THE

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.235
CITY YOU'VE GOT AT THE RICH IS

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:22.971
FOR I REFER.

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.872
TO WHAT HAS BEEN SUCH A VALUE TO

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:25.807

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:28.276
GREAT TREES.

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:30.111
AND I'M HOPEFUL BASED ON WHAT

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.446
I'VE SEEN LITTLE LOT OF THOSE

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.181
TALLER TREES.

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:36.351
THAT WERE SCORCHED.

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:36.985
BUT WON'T BE WE CAN SUCH A DEAL

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:37.885
DIE.

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:39.020
WITH THE CANOPIES INTACT AND

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.955

THERE'S SOME HOPE THAT THE

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:47.528
CHARACTER THAT COMMUNITY.

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:48.796
CAN TO THEM TO SOME DEGREE

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:31.606
FAIR TO SAY THAT THEY ARE A WE

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:32.507
NUMBER.

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:33.141
IS POTENTIALLY

01:28:33.207 --> 01:28:34.809
DISPROPORTIONATELY A LITTLE BIT

01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:35.476
LOWER.

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:37.311
DURING THIS POINT IN THE CLEANUP

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:41.716
THAN WE'VE SEEN BUT GENERALLY

WE GENERALLY SEE A PRETTY

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:48.122
SIGNIFICANT UPTICK IN THE NUMBER

I DON'T THINK WE'RE ALARMED AT

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:55.163
THE NUMBER I THINK IT'S VERY SAY

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:56.431
MIGHT BE A LITTLE LOWER

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:57.265
DISPROPORTIONATELY NUMBER WE

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:58.166
SEEN BUT WE EXPECT TO SEE AN

01:28:58.232 --> 01:28:59.701

I WAS GOING TO SAY TO THEM

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:12.113
[inaudible]

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.748

THE FIRST.

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:18.453
MONTH AND A HALF OR SO.

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:20.722
REALLY WAS TO GETTING ALL THAT

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:23.558
HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE OFF WE

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:26.961
ARE NOW COLLECTIVELY COMPLETE

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.763

AND AS MR ARMEY NOTED A

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:15.122
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:17.458
SPENDING TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:18.792
MILLION IS.

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:20.828
TO IMPLEMENT THE A PACKAGE OF

01:38:20.894 --> 01:38:23.998
BILLS THAT WERE PASSED IN.

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:25.899

01:38:28.869 --> 01:38:30.170
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:31.805

THIS ENHANCED FIRE PROTECTION --

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:35.943
AND THESE ARE THE THE CAL FIRE

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:37.911
RESOURCES THAT MR ARMEY DISCUSS

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:39.346
THAT THE THIRTEEN YEAR ROUND

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:42.783
FIRE ENGINES THE FIRST PHASE OF

01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:44.385
THAT IS THE ONE THIRTY AIRCRAFT.

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:45.719
AND THAT THE NUMBERS THAT MISTER

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:46.887
ARMEY PRESENTED OR A LITTLE

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:48.389
HIGHER FOR THE ENHANCE FIRE

01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:49.857
PROTECTION I THINK THE

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.258
MINISTRATION IS ALSO --

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:53.294
POINTING OUT THE HUNDRED AND

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.161
NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:55.696
HELICOPTERS THAT'S NOT A BUDGET

01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:57.598
PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU THIS YEAR

01:38:57.665 --> 01:38:58.165
THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:00.434
APPROVED IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND

01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:02.002
AND IT'S A MULTI YEAR PLAN --

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:04.071
BUT THAT IS ONE THING TO KEEP IN

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:05.072
MIND THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL

01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:07.641
COSTS I RELATED TO THE CONTINUED

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:08.275
IMPLEMENTATION ON THE

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:09.543
HELICOPTERS.

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:10.577
I'M AND THEN THERE'S JUST A FEW

01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:12.846
TIMES SMALLER PROPOSALS RELATED

01:39:12.913 --> 01:39:18.819
TO THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE LANDS --

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:19.687
AND SO WE JUST WANTED TO PRESENT

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:20.688
THAT IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF SORT

01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:21.555
OF THINKING ABOUT.

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:23.824
WHAT ALL THE PROPOSALS ARE?

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:24.491
I'M WE'RE OBVIOUSLY STILL IN THE

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:25.626
VERY PRELIMINARY STAGES OF

01:39:25.693 --> 01:39:26.760
REVIEWING THESE BETTER PROPOSALS

01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:28.228
ON AND WE WILL HAVE A MORE

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:28.929
DETAILED --

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:29.997
COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

01:39:30.064 --> 01:39:30.898
YOU AS WE GET INTO THE SUB

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:32.599
COMMITTEE PROCESS AND THAT FOR

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:33.801
TODAY WE WANT TO JUST MAKE SOME

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:35.769
INITIAL ANSWER OF HIGH LEVEL

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:37.204
COMMENTS ON HOW YOU MIGHT WANT.

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:39.173
TO START THINKING ABOUT OVERALL

01:39:39.239 --> 01:39:41.975
AND WILD FIRES FINDING AND THEN

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.644
HOW TO BALANCE PRIORITIES.

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:45.179
AND SO FIRST I YOU'RE GONNA WANT

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:47.548
TO THINK ABOUT.

01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:50.651
FIRE RESPONSE AND FOREST HEALTH

01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:52.553
AND FIRE PREVENTION I IF YOU

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.721
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES

01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:55.022
THAT WE'RE FINDING IN THE BUDGET

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:56.690
AND THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE WAS

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:59.126
VERY FOCUSED ON FOREST HEALTH.

01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:00.994
AND FIRE PREVENTION.

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:02.830
WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S COMING IN

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:04.531
AND MAKING A LOT OF ADDITIONAL

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:05.265
AND THAT?

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:06.867
HAS BEEN THE REQUESTS ARE TEND

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:09.002
TO BE ON THE FIRE SUPPRESSION

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:11.472
AND FIRE RESPONSE SIDE BOTH OF

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:12.673
THESE THINGS ARE NEEDED.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.974
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:14.608
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CONSIDER

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:16.009
IS THE X. TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:17.478
YOU'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:19.179
BEYOND WAY THE LEGISLATURE

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:20.981
ALREADY INDICATED THROUGH THE

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:22.383
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE LAST YEAR.

01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:24.952
DO YOU WANT TO BALANCE BETWEEN

01:40:25.018 --> 01:40:27.488
MORE FOREST HEALTH OR MORE AT

01:40:27.554 --> 01:40:29.223
FIRE SUPPRESSION RESOURCES AND

01:40:29.289 --> 01:40:30.691
SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:32.326
WHEN YOU'R LOOKING AT THE FIRE

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:33.660
SUPPRESSION RESOURCES AND WE

01:40:33.727 --> 01:40:35.062
TOUCHED ON THIS A LITTLE BIT

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:37.498
EARLIER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.700
NOT PUT FORWARD IT RECENTLY A

01:40:39.767 --> 01:40:42.069
VERY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN LOOKING

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:43.737
AT STATE VERSUS?

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:46.673
LOCAL AND CAPACITY AND GAPS

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.508
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THIS

01:40:47.574 --> 01:40:48.909
INFORMATION IS AND NOT BEING

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:51.412
CONSIDERED AND IT'S IT'S NOT A

01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:53.347
CRITICISM OF THE WORK THAT THE

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:54.548
L. YES AND HOW FIRES DOING

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:55.115
CURRENTLY.

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:56.650
BUT IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:57.885
ADDING THESE BUDGET

01:40:57.951 --> 01:40:59.520
AUGMENTATIONS THERE'S BEEN A

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:00.554
NUMBER OF THEM IN THE CURRENT

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:01.855
YEAR AND NUMBER OF THEM IN THE

01:41:01.922 --> 01:41:02.823
PRIOR YEAR.

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:04.425
I'M LOOKING AT ADICIONAL FIRE

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:05.893
ENGINES LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:09.163
STAFF SEEN HELICOPTERS AIRCRAFT

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:11.031
AND AND THEN HOW YOU FACTOR IN

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:15.836
THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM --

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:18.605
THE PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES AT

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:19.640
WEAR THAT.

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:22.042
AND THAT CAPACITY IS IN THE GAPS

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:23.577
ARE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT

01:41:23.644 --> 01:41:24.411
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT COULD AND

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:26.447
FORMER OF A MULTI YEAR STRATEGY

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:28.182
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CONTINUE

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:29.616
TO HAVE THESE VERY SEVERE FIRE

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:30.818
SEASONS --

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:32.219
AND MORE AND MORE RESOURCES ARE

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.120
NEEDED --

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:34.655
ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW FIRE ENGINES

01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:36.557
POTENTIALLY IN FUTURE YEARS

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:37.925
WHERE YOU LOCATE THOSE --

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:39.560
RIGHT NOW FOR CALIFORNIA --

01:41:39.626 --> 01:41:41.061
SORT OF CONSTRAINED AS BEST

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:42.496
WHERE THEY PUT YOU FIRE ENGINES

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:43.597
BASED ON WHERE THEY HAVE A

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:44.798
STATION THAT CAN ACCEPT A NEW

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:45.666
ENGINE.

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:46.900
DO WE NEED TO BE THINKING LONGER

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:48.335
TERM ABOUT CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:49.703
PROJECTS TO THE NEED TO BE

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:50.938
BUILDING NEW STATIONS JUST

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:52.072
HAVING A BROADER ASSESSMENT

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:53.640
COULD HELP AND FORMER OF A MULTI

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:54.675
YEAR STRATEGY.

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.143
SO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHERE

01:41:56.210 --> 01:41:57.644
WHERE WE TRYING TO GET TO IN

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:59.313
TERMS OF READINESS --

01:41:59.379 --> 01:42:00.547
AND ALSO WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:01.982
GOING TO BE OVER THE LONG TERM

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:03.817
AND AND IS THE LEVEL THAT WERE

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:05.652
YOU WERE TAKING ON IN THIS YEAR

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:06.153
THE LEVEL THAT YOU'RE

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.154
COMFORTABLE WITH --

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:08.555
KNOWING WHERE IT MIGHT GO IN THE

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:09.556
FUTURE --

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:11.692
AND I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT

01:42:11.758 --> 01:42:15.295
AND ACTUALLY WANT ONE MORE THING

01:42:39.052 --> 01:42:48.562
QUESTIONS.

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:50.264
WE OFTEN FOLLOWED BY LUMIGAN

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.299
ABSURD TO AYE KOWSKI STERN.

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:56.837
AND WHAT YOU NAY MCGUIRE.

01:42:56.904 --> 01:43:01.675
THE TO NIELSEN.

01:43:01.742 --> 01:43:02.709
THIS SHOULD BE UP.

01:43:02.776 --> 01:43:03.610
AND OBSERVATION [inaudible]

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:05.846
BUT IT'S I GOING FORWARD

01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:07.548
OBSERVATION.

01:43:07.614 --> 01:43:10.384
APPLICABLE THE THINGS THAT WE DO.

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:11.318
PROTECT THE IN TERMS OF

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:14.688
PREVENTION.

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:16.256
THE FIRE TAX WAS IMPOSED SEVERAL

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:18.091
YEARS AGO.

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:20.661
IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS THEREAFTER

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:21.895
IN MY INQUIRIES IN THE BUDGET.

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:23.630
SUBCOMMITTEE.

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:27.100
ABOUT HOW THOSE MONIES WERE USED.

01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:28.101
AND THE PUBLIC WAS PROMISED

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:29.903
SUPPRESSION [inaudible]

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:31.772
WELL.

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:34.007
THAT DIDN'T EXACTLY HAPPEN.

01:43:34.074 --> 01:43:35.742
AND IT DID NOT INSPIRE IN ME

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:37.311
CONFIDENCE.

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:37.844
THAT THAT WAS A VERY GOOD

01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:39.279
INVESTMENT.

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:42.182
BECAUSE CAL FIRE DIDN'T USED.

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:43.283
FOR THE PURPOSES IT WAS

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:45.652
PRESENTED AND PROMISED.

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:47.654
AND I TAKE IT CANNOT BE MUCH

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:49.256
ARGUED THAT.

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:52.059
IT WASN'T A GRAND SUCCESS BASED

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:52.960
ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THESE

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:55.963
FIRES.

01:43:56.029 --> 01:43:57.831
MY POINT TO THAT IS WHATEVER WE

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:00.300
DO PROSPECTIVELY WE NEED TO HAVE

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:01.602
SET UP TRACKING.

01:44:01.668 --> 01:44:02.970
AND THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:05.405
COMMITTEES NEED TO BE VERY TOUGH

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:06.940
IN THEIR SCRUTINY OF HOW

01:44:07.007 --> 01:44:09.376
RESOURCES THAT ARE DEPLOYED AS

01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:11.044
WE WILL BE IN THIS BUDGET.

01:44:11.111 --> 01:44:12.913
NUMBER THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:13.647
WHAT HE'S BEING WILLING TO

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:14.881
DEPLOY.

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:16.450
WITH THAT KEEP AN EYE ON AND

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:18.018
MAKE SURE IT IS USED FOR THE

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:21.054
PURPOSES INTENDED AND PROMISED.

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:22.422
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:24.157
NECESSARILY BEEN SOLD HERE THUS

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:26.526
FAR.

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:28.328
IT WILL BE THE SAME THING AS WE

01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:29.830
GET INTO ANOTHER SECTION HERE

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:32.265
AND THAT'S THE NINE ONE ONE

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:33.400
ISSUE THE GOVERNOR'S CAMANCHE

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:34.001
WITH THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.702
SOMEONE NOW THE GENERAL FUND AND

01:44:35.769 --> 01:44:36.703
THEN THEY'LL BE SOME.

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:38.739
DECIDING FOR THE NEXT RESOURCES

01:44:38.805 --> 01:44:40.173
ARE GOING TO BE.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.142
IN OUR DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR

01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:43.443
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:46.546
AT THE VERY END OF THE YEAR.

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:48.849
THERE WAS NOT MUCH CLARITY ABOUT.

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:50.517
WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM ARE WE

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:52.886
TALKING ABOUT?

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:54.855
THAT WE NEED AN IMPROVEMENT I

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:56.957
DON'T THINK IS IN QUESTION.

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:59.092
BUT CALIFORNIA HAS BLOWN SO MANY

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:01.294
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:03.330
ON TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS.

01:45:03.397 --> 01:45:06.166
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:08.301
AND MY SENSITIVITY HERE WHATEVER

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:09.603
WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT NINE ONE

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:10.537
ONE AND THEN PROVING THAT

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:12.239
COMMUNICATION AND THAT ALSO DOES

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:13.874
INCLUDE THE COMMUNICATION IN THE

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.642
FIELD NOT JUST TO THE NINE ONE

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:18.478
ONE OPERATOR.

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:20.113
WE BETTER MAKE DARN SURE.

01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.715
THAT WHOEVER WE'RE CONTRACTING

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:23.483
WHETHER WHATEVER PRODUCT WE'RE

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.352
CONTRACTING.

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:26.553
FOR WE HAVE THE HIGHEST DEGREE

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.187
OF ASSURANCE.

01:45:27.254 --> 01:45:29.222
THAT IS GOING TO WORK.

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:31.258
AND WE HAVE SOME BENCHMARKS.

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:34.094
THE PROVIDER HAS GOT TO HEED. TO

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:35.529
ENSURE.

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:37.330
IT DOES THE JOB AND WE JUST KEEP

01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:38.932
DOT KEEP THROWING MONEY AT AS I

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:41.535
THINK SO MANY TIMES WE DO HERE

01:45:41.601 --> 01:45:41.835
[inaudible]

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:44.237
IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible]

01:45:44.304 --> 01:45:48.175
THE SO THE GETTING BACK TO TWO

01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:50.143
THE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:53.380
AS WE MOVE AHEAD.

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:54.448
ARE WE GOING TO BE.

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:55.749
PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:57.484
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND NOT JUST

01:45:57.551 --> 01:46:01.321
AROUND THE HOMES. FOR THE

01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:02.689
PROPERTIES.

01:46:02.756 --> 01:46:06.560
BUT THE AREAS. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:09.563
CHANGED IN THE RECENT YEARS

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:11.398
THESE FIRES NOW OR ENCROACHING

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:14.835
ON THE SIX READING SANTA ROSA

01:46:14.901 --> 01:46:16.236
FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT'S SOMETHING

01:46:16.303 --> 01:46:17.370
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AHEAD TO

01:46:17.437 --> 01:46:20.607
NOW.

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:25.445
OF DO NOT HOW WE HAVE THESE

01:46:25.512 --> 01:46:27.681
BUFFER ZONES IF YOU WILL OR WHAT

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:28.315
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS

01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:30.984
OF THE PREVENTION AND

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:31.918
ANTICIPATING WHERE THE FIRES ARE

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:32.853
GOING TO HAVE TO BE THE MOST

01:46:32.919 --> 01:46:34.654
LIKELY.

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:35.689
TO DO THE MOST DAMAGE.

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:36.757
I GATHER THAT'S PARTY OF PRE

01:46:36.823 --> 01:46:38.258
POSITIONING THE CONSIDERATION IS

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:40.761
NOT [inaudible]

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:44.931
OKAY.

01:46:44.998 --> 01:46:45.899
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S COUPLE OF

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.801
OBSERVATIONS AS WE MOVE AHEAD.

01:46:47.868 --> 01:46:49.169
I I JUST LIKE TO HAVE THAT.

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:49.870
TO BIG KNOWLEDGE AND AND WOULD

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:50.937
LIKE TO HAVE AS WE GO THROUGH

01:46:51.004 --> 01:46:52.939
THE BUDGET COME TO US WITH SOME

01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:54.474
FACTS AND SOME INFORMATION.

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:56.176
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WITH

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:58.245
THESE COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES

01:46:58.311 --> 01:47:00.380
THAT WE'RE GOING TO EMPLOY AND

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:02.082
DEPLOY? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:03.817
WAS PROACTIVE IN THIS PROBABLY

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:05.118
OF SMALL.

01:47:05.185 --> 01:47:05.886
SIGNIFICANCE BUT NOT IN

01:47:05.952 --> 01:47:08.955
CONSEQUENCE.

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:12.125
I'M A BIG DOUBLE K. F. C. C. C..

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:13.894
A PARTICULAR NOW WHEN INMATE

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.797
FIREFIGHTERS ARE NOT AS RELIABLE.

01:47:16.863 --> 01:47:18.398
IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OR IN TERMS

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:19.900
OF THE QUALITY THE INDIVIDUALS

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:23.470
WHO ARE OUT IN THE CAMPS.

01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:26.072
AND SO I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR CCC

01:47:26.139 --> 01:47:27.974
DEPLOYMENT AND UP ON THE RIDGE

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:29.576
WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN UP A CCC

01:47:29.643 --> 01:47:31.344
CAMP.

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:32.412
NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:34.114
THOSE.

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:35.549
FOLKS WORKED ON THE FIRE LINES

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:36.316
WITH THEY WERE RIGHT WHERE THEY

01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:37.717
NEED TO BE THEY WERE PRE

01:47:37.784 --> 01:47:40.387
POSITION IF YOU WILL. FOR THOSE

01:47:40.453 --> 01:47:43.290
WHO SOME CONSIDERATIONS I THINK

01:47:43.356 --> 01:47:44.191
THIS PROSPECTIVELY WOULD BE.

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:46.526
VERY HELPFUL TO US.

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:48.061
JUST SOME OBSERVATIONS BUT THESE

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:49.396
ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE A

01:47:49.462 --> 01:47:52.132
PART OF OUR CONTINUING DIALOGUE.

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:52.766
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU

01:47:52.833 --> 01:47:56.303
VERY.

01:47:56.369 --> 01:47:56.670
ON THE EARLY --

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:57.838
MISS PETERS CAM WE JUMPED TO THE

01:47:57.904 --> 01:48:00.774
CHART ON PAGE SIX BECAUSE THE

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:03.310
NET GENERAL FUND COSTS IS GOING

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:05.078
TO BE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:06.313
THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:07.447
YOUR PRESENTATION WAS THAT

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:08.949
NORMALLY THERE'S A LOCAL SPLIT

01:48:09.015 --> 01:48:12.052
WITH THAT. SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY

01:48:12.118 --> 01:48:12.919
FIVE SO THE LOCALS UNDER THE

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:15.522
NORMAL COURSE WOULD BE EXPECTED

01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:17.524
TO PAY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:19.025
MILLION DOLLARS HOWEVER THE

01:48:19.092 --> 01:48:20.594
GOVERNOR HAS SUGGESTED THAT.

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.163
THAT WE WAIVE A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:24.431
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO THAT

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:26.833
WOULD LEAVE THE LOCALS WITH.

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.736
ROUGHLY EIGHTY MILLION BUCKS NOT

01:48:29.803 --> 01:48:31.104
COUNTING THE THIRTY ONE THAT

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:31.872
WE'RE GONNA BACK TO ON THE

01:48:31.938 --> 01:48:33.139
PROPERTY TAXES THAT'S ANOTHER

01:48:33.206 --> 01:48:35.075
THING BUT ARE WE ARE WE

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:36.509
EXPECTING THE LOCAL.

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:40.480
AREAS TO CHIP IN FOR THEIR SEVEN

01:48:40.547 --> 01:48:42.949
TO AN EIGHTY MILLION. TO MY

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:44.584
UNDERSTANDING AND AND FINANCE

01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:45.385
CAN ALWAYS CLARIFY THIS --

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:46.486
WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT PANEL OF

01:48:46.553 --> 01:48:47.621
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:49.155
NUMBERS ACTUALLY REFLECT ALREADY

01:48:49.222 --> 01:48:50.790
REFLECT THE STATE COVERING THE

01:48:50.857 --> 01:48:51.791
LOCAL CULTURE?

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.426
SO THAT THE THE NUMBERS THAT ARE

01:48:53.493 --> 01:48:55.195
ON THIS CHART WHICH WE'VE TAKEN

01:48:55.262 --> 01:48:56.563
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:48:56.630 --> 01:49:00.033
ESTIMATES ON ALREADY REFLECT US

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:05.005
COTTON SUPPORT WILL GET TOGETHER.

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:08.642
HEADS UP ON NOW LET'S JUMP TO

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:09.809
THE OUT WILDLIFE.

01:49:09.876 --> 01:49:14.347
URBAN INTERFACE AYE AYES ICY IT

01:49:14.414 --> 01:49:16.116
THOUGH --

01:49:16.182 --> 01:49:18.418
WILDLAND FIRE FIGHTERS YOU KNOW

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:20.153
THE MANAGE FOR FIRES THERE'S

EVERY FIRE OUT THE STARTS --

01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:20.647
THAT WE DON'T WE ARE USING AS A

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:22.782
PRESCRIBED FIRE --

01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:24.918
AT TEN ACRES OR LESS AND WE MEET

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:26.920
THAT 95% OF THE TIME AND THAT'S

SERVICE HAS A SIMILAR --

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.396
GOALS AS WELL --

01:50:36.463 --> 01:50:37.630
IN.

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:38.398
CALIFORNIA --

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:39.065
IS --

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:41.234
RESPONSE WE WE DO NOT MANAGE

01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:43.603
FIRE -- WE

01:50:43.670 --> 01:50:45.038
FIGHT FIRE AND WE PUT BY HERSELF

01:50:45.105 --> 01:50:47.140
AND AND THAT'S ON ALL LANDS THAT

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:49.209
WERE RESPONSIBLE [inaudible]

01:50:49.275 --> 01:50:51.177
FOR SO --

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:53.380
WHEN YOU GET TO THE NATIONAL

01:50:53.446 --> 01:50:55.181
FOREST SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME

01:50:55.248 --> 01:50:56.716
AREAS OF THE STATE --

01:50:56.783 --> 01:50:58.418
PARTICULARLY IN THOSE BACK WOODS

01:50:58.485 --> 01:51:01.588
AREAS WHERE NATURAL STARTS --

01:51:01.654 --> 01:51:03.056
WILL BE MANAGED --

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:04.424
BUT AGAIN WE ARE NOT PART OF

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:06.026
THAT SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE THE

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.494
FEDERAL SYSTEM.

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:08.762
AND WE WATCH THOSE VERY

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:10.363
CAREFULLY BECAUSE OFTEN WHAT

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:13.166
HAPPENS IS THOSE FIRES GROW TO A

01:51:13.233 --> 01:51:14.200
POINT WHERE THEY COME OUT OF

01:51:14.267 --> 01:51:15.902
THERE PRESCRIPTION.

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:18.071
AND START TO COME INTO THE STATE

01:51:18.138 --> 01:51:20.240
RESPONSIBILITY AREA SO WE

01:51:20.306 --> 01:51:21.775
MONITOR THOSE CLICK CLOSELY --

01:51:21.841 --> 01:51:23.309
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE FOR

01:51:23.376 --> 01:51:24.177
SERVICES MEETING THER

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:26.279
OBLIGATIONS TO KEEP THEIR FIRES

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:28.748
OFF OF PRIVATE LAND AS WELL.

01:51:28.815 --> 01:51:30.617
GIVEN THE EVOLVING SCIENCE ON

01:51:30.683 --> 01:51:32.786
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FREQUENCY

01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:35.188
OF SEVERE WEATHER AND FIRES HAS

01:51:35.255 --> 01:51:36.990
THAT CHANGED YOUR THINKING OR

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:40.927
THE COMMUNITIES THINKING ABOUT.

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:41.494
FOR PUTTING ON EVERY FIRE IS

01:51:41.561 --> 01:51:44.664
THERE ASEFI GOING ON THAT THERE

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:46.533
MAY BE SOME FIRES THAT WE NEED

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.735
TO MANAGE BY LETTING THEM BURN

01:51:48.802 --> 01:51:50.003
SINCE THAT.

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:51.771
BE A NATURALLY OCCURRING PIC OF

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:53.339
PHENOMENA IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:56.409
THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:57.877
AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:51:57.944 --> 01:52:00.447
FEDERAL SYSTEM AND AND AND CAL

01:52:00.513 --> 01:52:01.281
FIRE --

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:02.282
WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:03.516
LANDOWNERS.

01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:05.685
IS THAT THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:08.121
EVERY SINGLE PRIVATE LANDOWNER

01:52:08.188 --> 01:52:10.290
OR A STATE CONSERVANCY OR STATE

01:52:10.356 --> 01:52:11.424
LANDOWNER.

01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:12.826
IN THE STATE AND EVERYONE OF

01:52:12.892 --> 01:52:14.260
THEM HAS A DIFFERENT --

01:52:14.327 --> 01:52:16.763
MANAGEMENT REGIME THAT THEY SEE

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.431
FOR THEIR PRIVATE LAND --

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:19.732
WE CANNOT --

01:52:19.799 --> 01:52:23.436
ENTER INTO --

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:24.604
WHAT WOULD BE IN?

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:25.905
MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT AGREEMENTS --

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:27.107
ON THE NUMBER OF PARCELS THAT

01:52:27.173 --> 01:52:28.775
ARE OUT THERE IN THE IN THE WILD

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:30.510
LAND -- IN

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:32.512
ORDER TO HAVE BE ABLE TO HAVE A

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:34.047
FIDELITY OF WHICH WHICH

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:35.648
LANDOWNER WANTS FIRE TO BURN

01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:37.984
ACROSS THEIR PRIVATE LAND.

01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:38.651
OR NOT.

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:41.554
SO WE HAVE TO ASSUME ALL OF THE

01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:43.089
FIRES OUT --

01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:44.657
TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AND

01:52:44.724 --> 01:52:48.495
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE 95% --

01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:49.929
OF ALL FIRES LESS THAN TEN ACRES

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:51.764
AND AND I I DO UNDERSTAND THE

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:52.732
ECOLOGICAL --

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:54.467
PIECE OF WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE

01:52:54.534 --> 01:52:55.401
GETTING.

01:52:55.468 --> 01:52:58.338
TO AND THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE --

01:52:58.404 --> 01:53:00.240
ADDRESSED THROUGH ARE PRESCRIBED

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:01.841
FIRE -- AND

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.843
FUELS MANAGEMENT GOALS THAT

01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:05.545
WE'RE INCREASING --

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:07.280
CURRENTLY ACROSS THE STATE

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:10.650
THERE'S ABOUT --

01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:11.651
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES

01:53:11.718 --> 01:53:13.253
ON STATE AND PRIVATE LANDS THAT

01:53:13.319 --> 01:53:14.587
ARE DONE ANNUALLY.

01:53:14.654 --> 01:53:17.223
AND WE'RE LOOKING TO DOUBLE THAT

01:53:17.290 --> 01:53:19.526
IN IN THROUGH THROUGH THE

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:21.461
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE FORCE

01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:23.796
CARBON PLAN.

01:53:23.863 --> 01:53:25.098
AND TO MEET THE RESILIENCY GOAL

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:26.833
SO WE WILL BE DOING A LOT MORE

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.068
FUELS REDUCTION PROJECT WORK AND

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:30.837
PRESCRIBED BURNING THAT WILL BE

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:32.372
UNDER UNDER OUR TERMS.

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:35.108
ON LANDS THAT WE HAVE AGREEMENTS --

01:53:35.175 --> 01:53:37.243
WHERE THE LAND OWNERS WANT THAT

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:39.145
TYPE OF ACTIVITY TO HAPPENED?

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:41.814
EVEN WITH A DOUBLING OF OUR IN

01:53:41.881 --> 01:53:42.982
THE IN THE ADDITIONAL MONEY SAID

01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:44.250
PUT AND I'LL GET TO THE

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:48.188
SUPPRESSION PREVENTION BALANCE.

01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:49.522
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AT A

01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:50.723
THIRTY THREE MILLION ACRES IS

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.560
THAT ENOUGH GIVEN GIVEN THE M.

01:53:53.626 --> 01:53:56.429
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH OF OF

01:53:56.496 --> 01:53:58.531
PEOPLE MOVING IT LIVING IN THESE

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.066
CONDITIONS IN THE IN THE WILD

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:00.567
LANDS.

01:54:00.633 --> 01:54:02.068
AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE

01:54:02.135 --> 01:54:04.037
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAKE THOSE

01:54:04.103 --> 01:54:05.939
DECISIONS NOT TO STATE.

01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:07.874
AND THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION --

01:54:07.941 --> 01:54:10.009
AS OF TODAY AND THAT IS WHAT THE

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:12.612
SCIENCE SAYS IS ENOUGH TO TO TO

01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:13.947
START TO RESTORE FORCED

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:15.315
RESILIENCY --

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:18.518
IT IS BALANCED BY A HALF

01:54:18.585 --> 01:54:20.220
NATIONAL FOREST IS TRYING TO DO

01:54:20.286 --> 01:54:21.421
IN CALIFORNIA AT THE SAME TIME

01:54:21.487 --> 01:54:21.821
SO.

01:54:21.888 --> 01:54:23.957
IT'S ACTUALLY ONE MILLION ACRES

01:54:24.023 --> 01:54:25.658
ACROSS --

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:27.293
BOTH LANDSCAPES --

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.996
AND THAT'S WHAT THE FORCE CARBON

01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:32.265
PLAN KIND OF HONED IN ON AND AND

01:54:32.332 --> 01:54:34.000
CAME UP WITH THAT'S THE NUMBER

01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:35.868
THAT WE NEED TO DO --

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:37.870
WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TREAT

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:39.639
EVERY SINGLE ACRE THAT THAT

01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:40.840
COULD USE --

01:54:40.907 --> 01:54:42.508
THAT KIND OF TREATMENT --

01:54:42.575 --> 01:54:43.910
WILL HAVE TO DO THE ONES THAT

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:46.246
THAT ARE ARE ACCESSIBLE TO US

01:54:46.312 --> 01:54:47.480
AND WE OR WHERE WE HAVE

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:50.149
AGREEMENTS TO DO SO --

01:54:50.216 --> 01:54:51.751
AND THEN --

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:54.654
IT'S GOING TO TAKE DECADES TO OF

01:54:54.721 --> 01:54:56.823
RETURN FOREST HEALTH TO WHERE IT

01:54:56.889 --> 01:54:58.658
NEEDS TO BE AND THERE ARE GOING

01:54:58.725 --> 01:55:00.059
TO BE CHANGES ALONG THE WAY IT

01:55:00.126 --> 01:55:02.462
COULD BE THAT THE NEXT ITERATION

01:55:02.528 --> 01:55:04.931
OF THE OF THE CARBON PLAN --

01:55:04.998 --> 01:55:05.999
COULD TELL US SOMETHING

01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:07.533
DIFFERENT BUT RIGHT NOW THAT'S

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:08.768
WHERE WE ARE COULD YOU HELP US

01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:12.138
UNDERSTAND THE TREE REMOVAL --

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:13.206
CATASTROPHE THAT WE HAVE YOUR

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:15.642
PREDECESSOR TESTIFIED HIS

01:55:15.708 --> 01:55:18.911
THROUGH SEPT TWO LAST YEAR THAT

01:55:18.978 --> 01:55:19.445
THAT.

01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:20.813
YOU OVER --

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:21.614
TO GET A MILLION TREES REMOVED

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:22.815
THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:24.350
MILLION DEAD TREES IN CALIFORNIA

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:26.519
IT'S TAKING CAL FIRE TWO YEARS.

01:55:26.586 --> 01:55:28.921
SO THIS IS THE PRESCRIBED BURNS

01:55:28.988 --> 01:55:30.256
IS A DIFFERENT PART OF THE

01:55:30.323 --> 01:55:32.558
BUDGET ON THAT DEAD TREES.

01:55:32.625 --> 01:55:34.894
WHAT'S WHAT SHOULD WE BE TO AND

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:38.131
WHAT SHOULD I BE DEMANDING OF%

01:55:38.197 --> 01:55:40.433
CAL FIRE AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.670
AND COUNTIES AND PRIVATE LAND

01:55:43.736 --> 01:55:45.171
OWNERS.

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:45.872
THE AND THEN ANOTHER REALLY GOOD

01:55:45.938 --> 01:55:47.540
QUESTION BECAUSE ACROSS THE

01:55:47.607 --> 01:55:49.108
HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:55:49.175 --> 01:55:51.711
SEVEN MILLION.

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:54.113
TREES THAT ARE OUT THERE DEAD OR

01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:55.948
APPROXIMATELY --

01:55:56.015 --> 01:55:57.317
IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO THINK

01:55:57.383 --> 01:55:58.651
THAT WE'RE GOING.

01:55:58.718 --> 01:55:59.485
TO TAKE DOWN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

01:55:59.552 --> 01:56:03.323
THOSE OUR ACROSS THIS ACROSS THE

01:56:03.389 --> 01:56:06.592
LANDSCAPE IN PLACES WHERE --

01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:08.161
DEAD TREES ARE PART OF THE OF

01:56:08.227 --> 01:56:10.930
THE THE LANDSCAPE AND AND THAT

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:11.831
AND SOME OF THAT'S OKAY.

01:56:11.898 --> 01:56:13.199
SO.

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:14.567
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS CONTINUE

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:17.804
TO FOCUS ON ON THOSE AREAS WHERE

01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:19.138
HUMAN AND --

01:56:19.205 --> 01:56:20.673
BUT WHERE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:22.442
AND WHERE THERE IS CRITICAL NEED

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:24.377
TO REMOVE TREES IN ORDER TO

01:56:24.444 --> 01:56:25.645
PROTECT THOSE.

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:27.513
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:29.949
WHEN WE GET INTO THE THE DEEPER

01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:31.784
WOODS OR THE BACK COUNTRY THEN

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.152
WE HAVE THERE THERE'S A A

01:56:33.219 --> 01:56:34.954
DECISION THAT HAS TO BE MADE AS

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:37.490
TO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN EXPECT?

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:40.660
THE FOREST TO RECOVER ON ITS OWN --

01:56:40.727 --> 01:56:42.328
WHETHER THEY'RE ST PLANTING THAT

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:44.430
NEEDS TO BE DONE WHETHER SOME OF

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:45.965
THOSE TREES NEED TO BE REMOVED

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:48.334
OR NOT BASED ON ALL OF THOSE

01:56:48.401 --> 01:56:50.770
FACTORS --

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:51.137
WHAT I WILL --

01:56:51.204 --> 01:56:52.705
IT WOULD POINT YOU TO THINK

01:56:52.772 --> 01:56:55.208
ABOUT IS WHEN THOSE TREES THAT

01:56:55.274 --> 01:56:57.677
ARE DEAD FALL AND ARE STREWN

01:56:57.744 --> 01:56:58.978
ABOUT ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE

01:56:59.045 --> 01:57:00.680
THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE FOR

01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:02.482
FIFTY PLUS YEARS AS FUELS.

01:57:02.548 --> 01:57:03.683
THAT WILL --

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.418
BURN IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE

01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:06.252
CALM.

01:57:06.319 --> 01:57:08.154
AND SO WE DO HALF WE HAVE TO

01:57:08.221 --> 01:57:10.990
LOOK AT IF WE DO INVEST IN

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:13.259
REFORESTATION AND PLANTING.

01:57:13.326 --> 01:57:14.160
SOME OF THOSE AREAS IN THE BACK

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:16.095
COUNTRY SOME OF THAT FUEL DOES

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:18.231
NEED TO BE REMOVED THE TREES

01:57:18.297 --> 01:57:18.998
NEED TO BE DROPPED.

01:57:19.065 --> 01:57:22.535
BUT THERE'S AN ECOLOGICAL RE

01:57:22.602 --> 01:57:27.974
GROUND AS WELL SO THERE THIS

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.542
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE.

01:57:29.609 --> 01:57:31.711
AND WE REALLY JUST NEED TO FOCUS

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:33.146
ON THOSE ON THOSE --

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:35.415
HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:36.783
WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:57:36.849 --> 01:57:38.317
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SAFE AND

01:57:38.384 --> 01:57:39.385
AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING

01:57:39.452 --> 01:57:40.486
TO BE SO WE HAVE ANOTHER

01:57:40.553 --> 01:57:41.921
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:57:41.988 --> 01:57:43.589
REDUCTION CHALLENGE ALSO SO

01:57:43.656 --> 01:57:45.591
WHILE WHILE IT MIGHT BE.

01:57:45.658 --> 01:57:49.328
MIGHT WORK FROM AN ECOLOGICAL

01:57:49.395 --> 01:57:50.963
POINT OF VIEW WITH THE WITH THE

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.664
FOR THE FORCE THAT IS ALSO

01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:54.300
INCREASING THE EMISSIONS THAT --

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:56.135
WE MAY BE ABLE TO SPEED THAT UP

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.670
IF THEY WERE CHAPTER OR ARE SOME

01:57:57.737 --> 01:57:58.838
FROM REMOVED.

01:57:58.905 --> 01:58:00.673
I'M CONCERNED WITH THE BALANCE

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:02.408
YOU KNOW --

01:58:02.475 --> 01:58:03.142
AND I'M WONDERING WHEN WE GET

01:58:03.209 --> 01:58:04.911
THE TIP HIT THE TIPPING POINT ON

01:58:04.977 --> 01:58:06.746
PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION YOU

01:58:06.813 --> 01:58:09.348
KNOW THAT IT'S NO IT'S IT'S NOT.

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:11.184
A SECRET THAT THE BULK OF THE

01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:13.319
MONEY THAT'S BEING ASKED FROM

01:58:13.386 --> 01:58:16.689
THE AGENCIES BEFORE S..

01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:17.824
ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT.

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:19.258
CONSIDERING THAT RIGHT NOW WITH

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:21.527
THE FULL LOOK FOR TO THAT IN SUB

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:22.728
TOO BUT IT'S ON SUPPRESSION AND

01:58:22.795 --> 01:58:23.830
THE NEW MONEY THAT'S COMING IN

01:58:23.896 --> 01:58:26.365
IS BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S POINT

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:28.100
OUT BODY ALITALIA'S REPORT.

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:29.635
ISON SUPPRESSION WHEN DO WE

01:58:29.702 --> 01:58:33.239
MEET THE TIPPING POINT BECAUSE

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:34.841
IT SEEMS.

01:58:34.907 --> 01:58:36.175
TO ME THAT IF WE IF WE DOUBLED

01:58:36.242 --> 01:58:38.344
DOWN ON THE PREVENTION TO REMOVE

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:39.912
SOME OF THE FUELS THEN WE MIGHT

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:41.180
NOT NEED.

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:42.148
FOUR HUNDRED RESPONSES FROM THE

01:58:42.215 --> 01:58:43.783
CITY'S CHANNEL I DON'T HAVE

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:46.786
FIRES IN MY DISTRICT BUT THE CAL

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:47.653
FREMONT.

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:51.257
POLICE DEPARTMENT SAN JOSE THEY

01:58:51.324 --> 01:58:52.825
WERE ALL FROM RESPOND THERE'S

01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:54.827
THIRD THEY RESPONDED SO FAR

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:56.095
MAYBE THIS YEAR I'LL BE.

01:58:56.162 --> 01:58:57.396
I'LL BE FILLED WITH THAT BUT I'M

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:59.131
JUST SAYING THAT THAT THAT THE

01:58:59.198 --> 01:59:01.467
RESPONSE BUT THERE AGAIN I THINK

01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:03.636
THAT THEY THEIR CHARGES IS

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:05.938
DIFFERENT WIN.

01:59:06.005 --> 01:59:07.240
IF WE'RE INVESTING.

01:59:07.306 --> 01:59:10.910
MY QUESTION IS IS THAT ON THESE.

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:12.044
AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH

01:59:12.111 --> 01:59:14.447
A POUND OF CURE RIDER WITH A

01:59:14.514 --> 01:59:15.882
VICE VERSA POUND THE PREVENTION

01:59:15.948 --> 01:59:17.517
FIRST NOW SECURE.

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:18.885
PUT SO.

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:22.922
HELP ME WITH THE A CHALLENGE

01:59:22.989 --> 01:59:24.790
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:27.026
THESE EXPECTATION OF GIGANTIC

01:59:27.093 --> 01:59:31.097
FIRES AND MODICUM OF PREVENTION

01:59:31.163 --> 01:59:33.032
I MEAN I I I I I. E..

01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:34.367
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE COULD

01:59:34.433 --> 01:59:36.369
DO MORE IN THE PREVENTION FEEL

01:59:36.435 --> 01:59:37.770
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:59:37.837 --> 01:59:39.171
ESCALATE --

01:59:39.238 --> 01:59:41.374
THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:41.674
[inaudible]

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:46.279
AND A MINUTE AND THEN.

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:49.482
TAKE THE SURVEY PLEASE PLEASE.

01:59:49.549 --> 01:59:51.417
YEAH OKAY --

01:59:51.484 --> 01:59:53.753
JUST JUST JUST CLEAR BY --

01:59:53.819 --> 01:59:55.588
A COUPLE OF THINGS --

01:59:55.655 --> 01:59:57.189
EVERY ACRE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:59:57.256 --> 01:59:59.191
CAN BURN WILL BURN SOME DAY AND

01:59:59.258 --> 02:00:00.993
SO WE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO KIND OF

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.962
KEEP THAT IN MIND SO.

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:04.363
YES MAYBE.

02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:05.665
EACH OF OUR AREAS DOESN'T HAVE

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:07.433
IRE EVERY YEAR BUT HOPEFULLY

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.101
NOT NEXT YEAR --

02:00:09.168 --> 02:00:10.303
ANNA AND I WOULD --

02:00:10.369 --> 02:00:12.605
REFLECT THAT THIS COMING YEAR

02:00:12.672 --> 02:00:14.473
THAT HAS ALL THE INDICATIONS OF

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:17.944
BEING JUST AS AS POSSIBLY COULD

02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:21.681
TELL BECAUSE AS LAST YEAR AND

02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:23.849
THE YEAR BEFORE --

02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:26.085
SO RELATED TO THE THE

02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:29.622
SUPPRESSION VERSUS PREVENTION --

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:31.624
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PARSE

02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:33.059
THOSE OUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:35.027
ABOUT CAL FIRE --

02:00:35.094 --> 02:00:37.930
EVERY FIRE ENGINE THAT THAT --

02:00:37.997 --> 02:00:41.000
THAT COMES INTO OUR SYSTEM --

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:43.936
IS BOTH SUPPRESSION.

02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:45.371
AND PREVENTION.

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:48.274
AND THOSE ENGINE COMPANIES ARE

02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:50.810
CUTTING DOWN TREES IN SOME CASES

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:52.912
THEY'RE BUILDING A FIRE LINE TO

02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:54.447
DO PRESCRIBED FIRES.

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:55.181
THEY'RE PUTTING FIRE ON THE

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:56.882
GROUND AND DOING PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:58.684
PROJECT WORK THEY'RE DOING FUEL

02:00:58.751 --> 02:00:59.752
OTHER FUELS READ IT READ

02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:01.687
REDUCTION WORK THEY'RE DOING

02:01:01.754 --> 02:01:04.790
DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS --

02:01:04.857 --> 02:01:06.325
BUT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:09.161
HAVE SO ANY ANYTHING THAT YOU

02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:11.397
INVEST IN OR OR THAT THE STATE

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:12.732
INVESTS IN --

02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:15.067
RELATED TO RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:01:15.134 --> 02:01:19.171
CAL FIRE RESOURCES DO BOTH --

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:21.807
ALL OF THE INVESTMENT WHILE IT'S

02:01:21.874 --> 02:01:23.309
A VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL.

02:01:23.376 --> 02:01:25.244
IN IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:01:25.311 --> 02:01:26.412
PARTNERSHIP THAT CAN BE

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:27.747
CONSIDERED.

02:01:27.813 --> 02:01:29.915
SUPPRESSION BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:01:29.982 --> 02:01:32.351
EMPLOY D..

02:01:32.418 --> 02:01:35.688
MUTUAL AID RATE RESOURCES FROM

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:37.623
IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:37.823
DOING.

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:39.625
PREVENTION.

02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:41.394
NOW THEY MIGHT DO PREVENTION IN

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:42.695
THEIR IN THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:43.996
AREA.

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:45.665
BUT AS FAR AS THE STATE

02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:47.767
RESPONSIBILITY AREA THE THOSE

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:49.602
RESOURCES DON'T DO THAT SO

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:51.103
ANYTHING THAT YOU THAT HAS A CAL

02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:53.005
FIRE PATCH ON IT IT SHOULD BE

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:54.140
CONSIDERED.

02:01:54.206 --> 02:01:57.143
AS BOTH PREVENTION AND

02:01:57.209 --> 02:02:00.479
SUPPRESSION AND BY AND LARGE.

02:02:00.546 --> 02:02:02.481
THAT INVESTMENT IS IN PREVENTION

02:02:02.548 --> 02:02:05.184
BECAUSE WHILE THEIR TRAINING

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:06.886
THEY'RE GETTING PREPARED.

02:02:06.952 --> 02:02:09.588
TO DO SUPPRESSION AND PREVENTION.

02:02:09.655 --> 02:02:12.391
THEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT TRAINING.

02:02:12.458 --> 02:02:13.759
THEIR ONLY RESPONDING TO

02:02:13.826 --> 02:02:14.593
INCIDENTS WHEN THEY'RE INCIDENTS

02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:16.228
GOING.

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:17.830
ALL THE REST OF THE TIME THEY'RE

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.799
DOING PREVENTION ACTIVE.

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:22.134
SO VERY MUCH --

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:23.636
THE ENGINES.

02:02:23.703 --> 02:02:26.105
AND AND THE CREWS --

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:29.141
THE THE SENATOR NIELSEN THE THE

02:02:29.208 --> 02:02:31.143
CCC CREWS THAT WERE ADDING VERY

02:02:31.210 --> 02:02:34.213
MUCH ARE PREVENTION RESOURCES.

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:35.781
SO I THINK I'D LIKE TO CAN MAYBE

02:02:35.848 --> 02:02:37.550
MAYBE TALK FURTHER --

02:02:37.616 --> 02:02:40.286
AT SOME POINT ABOUT HOW HOW WE

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:42.054
CAN MAYBE BREAK THAT DOWN IN

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:44.090
PERCENTAGE WISE IT FORWARD KIND

02:02:44.156 --> 02:02:45.624
OF YOU GIVE A BETTER --

02:02:45.691 --> 02:02:47.693
APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON OF

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:50.563
OF PREVENTION VERSUS --

02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:52.431
AND I I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:53.232
MADAM --

02:02:53.299 --> 02:02:57.036
CHAIRS AT THE BUDGET AS FOR

02:02:57.103 --> 02:02:57.603
HUNDRED NINETY NINE NEW --

02:02:57.670 --> 02:02:58.971
POSITIONS OR SEIZE SOMEONE FULL

02:02:59.038 --> 02:03:01.173
TIME HOW WOULD THAT HUNDRED AND

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:01.907
NINETY NINE HAD MADE A

02:03:01.974 --> 02:03:06.312
DIFFERENCE IF YOU HAD THEM IN.

02:03:06.378 --> 02:03:06.912
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND AND

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:07.313
JUST.

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:09.115
TO ENTERTAIN ME GIVE ME A BREAK

02:03:09.181 --> 02:03:09.849
DOWN ON THE PREVENTION

02:03:09.915 --> 02:03:10.783
SUPPRESSION.

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:11.917
WORK THERE WITH THEM BUT IF YOU

02:03:11.984 --> 02:03:13.786
HAD THEM DURING THESE BIG FIRES

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:15.187
WHAT.

02:03:15.254 --> 02:03:15.755
DIFFERENCE IF ANY WOULD HAVE

02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:17.490
MADE.

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:19.759
THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND

02:03:19.825 --> 02:03:21.494
I I I HOPE I DON'T SURPRISE YOU

SUPPRESSION IN PREVENTION AND

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:47.292

02:10:35.827 --> 02:10:37.729
AS YOU DEVELOPING THAT STRATEGIC

02:10:37.796 --> 02:10:41.033
PLAN ARE YOU FOR YOU CONSIDERING

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:43.468
SORT OF THE RISK MITIGATION

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:44.903
ACTIVITIES OR MAYBE OUTSIDE YOUR

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:49.074
PURVIEW AS WELL IN TERMS OF HOW.

02:10:49.141 --> 02:10:50.342
TO THE BY DOWN THAT RISK I MEAN

02:10:50.409 --> 02:10:53.212
I I'M I'M THINKING AGAIN ABOUT --

02:10:53.278 --> 02:10:55.180
THE CREATED RIGHT ONE OF THE

02:10:55.247 --> 02:10:56.882
MAJOR CONDITIONS SOURCE IN THE

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:59.551
STATE -- AND

02:10:59.618 --> 02:11:01.587
ONLY SO MUCH WE CAN GET DONE ON

02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:03.388
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OR TIMBER

02:11:03.455 --> 02:11:05.157
MANAGEMENT SOME OF ITS IN HOME

02:11:05.224 --> 02:11:06.525
HARDENING IN IN THE BUILDING

02:11:06.592 --> 02:11:08.360
CODES IN IN LAND USE PLANNING

02:11:08.427 --> 02:11:09.828
SOME OF IT'S ABOUT GREAT

02:11:09.895 --> 02:11:11.897
PLANNING AND WHERE ARE WHERE WE

02:11:11.964 --> 02:11:13.465
GENERATE POWER AND CAN WE DO IT

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:14.733
IN A DISTRIBUTED.

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.402
WAY SO AT IS SPECIALLY IN THOSE

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:20.739
AREAS UTILITIES MAYBE WANT TO BE

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:21.773
ABLE TO SHUT OFF POWER BUT THEY

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:22.774
DON'T WANT A BUNCH OF ANGRY

02:11:22.841 --> 02:11:23.842
RESIDENTS SAYING.

02:11:23.909 --> 02:11:25.677
WHY THEY GO DARK BUT?

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:27.312
THERE ACTUALLY OUR SOLUTIONS

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:29.248
THAT HAPPENED OR HOW YOU SHOULD

02:11:29.314 --> 02:11:30.282
INTEGRATING THOSE AND

02:11:30.349 --> 02:11:33.018
NONTRADITIONAL --

02:11:33.085 --> 02:11:35.621
FACTORS INTO THE STRATEGIC

02:11:35.687 --> 02:11:38.156
PLANNING TO HELP YOU.

02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:41.393
IN A GREAT MOOD.

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:42.995
SHE'S NOT PLEASE LET IN THE THAT

02:11:43.061 --> 02:11:44.663
IS THAT IS A KEY COMPONENT TO

02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:46.632
THIS THIS PLANNING PROCESS WHICH

02:11:46.698 --> 02:11:48.333
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN EVEN WE

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:49.935
WHERE WE WERE EIGHT TEN YEARS

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:52.104
AGO AS FAR AS STRATEGIC PLANNING

02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:54.106
WE REALLY HAVE.

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:55.807
TO LOOK AT THE THE TECHNOLOGICAL

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:57.843
ADVANCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

02:11:57.909 --> 02:12:01.813
US AND LOOK AT THE ABILITY. TO

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:03.115
TO BRING --

02:12:03.181 --> 02:12:05.884
WAYS OF ANALYZING DATA THAT

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:07.552
REALLY DIDN'T EVEN EXIST THE

02:12:07.619 --> 02:12:09.254
LAST TIME WE DID OUR STRATEGIC

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:11.757
PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SO.

02:12:11.823 --> 02:12:13.125
A GOING FORWARD ALL OF THAT'S

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:15.560
GOING TO BE PART OF OF THE THE

02:12:15.627 --> 02:12:17.162
FORMULA THAT WE'RE USING --

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:18.463
OF COURSE IT WILL BE MOE

02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:20.699
FOCUSED IN IN CERTAIN AREAS OF

02:12:20.766 --> 02:12:22.401
OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING THAN IN

02:12:22.467 --> 02:12:23.902
OTHERS -- WE

02:12:23.969 --> 02:12:26.338
DO -- WELL

02:12:26.405 --> 02:12:28.774
THERE ARE OF SOME PROMISING

02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.075
THOUGHTS TOWARD THE FUTURE AND

02:12:30.142 --> 02:12:32.544
IN THE SUPPRESSION.

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:35.280
OF WILDFIRES ARE USING --

02:12:35.347 --> 02:12:38.750
REMOTE SENSING AND OTHER HUMAN --

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:41.553
TYPE OF OF INTERACTION WITH THAT

02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:43.288
FIRE THAT'S HAPPENING --

02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:44.556
RIGHT NOW THERE IS THERE IS

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:45.757
NOTHING THAT REPLACES THE BOOTS

02:12:45.824 --> 02:12:47.826
ON THE GROUND.

02:12:47.893 --> 02:12:50.462
AND EVEN OUR AIRCRAFT ARE ALL

02:12:50.529 --> 02:12:52.764
GEARED TOWARD.

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:53.965
SLOWING OF FIRE DOWN SO WE CAN

02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:56.034
PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND --

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:58.704
SO SO IT'S A VERY IT'S IT'S IT'S

02:12:58.770 --> 02:13:00.205
IT'S GOT A VERY --

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:02.407
HUMAN GROUNDED ELEMENT --

02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:04.176
IN OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING BUT WE

02:13:04.242 --> 02:13:05.677
ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THOSE

02:13:05.744 --> 02:13:07.913
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES --

02:13:07.979 --> 02:13:09.381
WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AT

02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:10.882
THE DATA THAT'S NOW BECOMING

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:12.951
AVAILABLE THROUGH --

02:13:13.018 --> 02:13:16.521
THE CPUC --

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:20.092
AND THE THE THE THE WILD FIRE

02:13:20.158 --> 02:13:21.460
MITIGATION PLANS THAT THE

02:13:21.526 --> 02:13:24.096
UTILITIES ARE ARE ARE BRINGING --

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:25.464
FOR REVIEW WHICH THAT THEY'RE

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:28.200
ALL DUE ON THE SEVENTH OF OF

02:13:28.266 --> 02:13:30.402
THAT THE FEBRUARY SUS. ONE WEEK

02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:30.702
OUT -- WILL

02:13:30.769 --> 02:13:34.373
BE STE THOSE --

02:13:34.439 --> 02:13:35.774
WITH -- CPUC

02:13:35.841 --> 02:13:38.410
THAT WILL INFORM AND GIVE US

02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:40.846
MORE DATA TO TO UTILIZE TO KIND

02:13:40.912 --> 02:13:42.681
OF HONE IN ON THOSE AREAS THAT

02:13:42.748 --> 02:13:45.083
ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE GRID --

02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:47.652
AND AND THEN BE ABLE TO TAILOR

02:13:47.719 --> 02:13:49.287
SOME OF OUR PREVENTION

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:51.623
ACTIVITIES --

02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:53.625
TO THOSE THOSE AREAS AND THOSE

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:55.927
NEEDS SO ALL OF THIS IS COMING

02:13:55.994 --> 02:13:58.230
TOGETHER RIGHT NOW --

02:13:58.296 --> 02:13:59.731
WE'RE WORKING ON OUR EXECUTIVE

02:13:59.798 --> 02:14:01.633
ORDER FOR FORTY FIVE DAY

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.368
EXECUTIVE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:04.770
IS GOING TO INFORM.

02:14:04.836 --> 02:14:06.471
THESE DECISIONS AS WELL GOING

02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:08.273
FORWARD --

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:13.211
AND AND THEN OUR OUR INNOVATION

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:14.679
SPRINT -- IS

02:14:14.746 --> 02:14:16.982
ALSO GOING TO TO DO THAT THROUGH

02:14:17.048 --> 02:14:19.951
THE RFI SQUARED PRO PROCESS SO.

02:14:20.018 --> 02:14:21.019
THE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT

02:14:21.086 --> 02:14:23.955
ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ON GETTING

02:14:24.022 --> 02:14:25.724
US THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED

02:14:25.791 --> 02:14:28.794
TO REALLY MEET THAT GOAL --

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:30.295
ONE TO THE BEST THAT WE CAN

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:31.663
POSSIBLY --

02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:33.598
GET FIDELITY WISE LOOKING INTO

02:14:33.665 --> 02:14:35.066
THE FUTURE A BUT I DIDN'T HEAR

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:36.435
THOUGH --

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:39.905
BUILDING CODES AND LAND USE.

02:14:39.971 --> 02:14:41.373
BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF JUST.

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.908
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM IN A LOCAL

02:14:42.974 --> 02:14:45.777
JURISDICTIONS OBVIOUSLY HAVE.

02:14:45.844 --> 02:14:46.611
PRIMARY AUTHORITY ON A LOT OF

02:14:46.678 --> 02:14:49.481
THOSE QUESTIONS BUT IS A YEAR

02:14:49.548 --> 02:14:51.450
THINK INTO THE THEY DO AND THE

02:14:51.516 --> 02:14:53.118
REASON YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME SAY IT

02:14:53.185 --> 02:14:55.220
IS BECAUSE I I GLOSSED OVER I AM

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:56.254

AGED IN.

02:14:59.191 --> 02:15:01.026
LAND USE PLANNING AS WELL --

02:15:01.092 --> 02:15:01.993
WE HAVE --

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:05.330
STAFF SINCE --

02:15:05.397 --> 02:15:07.098
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE BUILT A

02:15:07.165 --> 02:15:08.433
LAND USE PLANNING.

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:11.470
A GROUP AND WE ARE WORKING WITH --

02:15:11.536 --> 02:15:14.239

LEVEL -- TO

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:19.778
INCREASE THEIR SAFETY ELEMENT --

02:15:19.845 --> 02:15:24.516
COMPLIANCE WITH AND AND THEN --

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:24.783

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:26.651
THOSE.

02:15:26.718 --> 02:15:29.554
YOU BUILDING CODE ELEMENTS AND

02:15:29.621 --> 02:15:31.289
AND THEN ALSO INFRASTRUCTURE

02:15:31.356 --> 02:15:33.558
ELEMENTS THAT ARE KEY TO

02:15:33.625 --> 02:15:35.460
RESILIENT COMMUNITIES.

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:36.628
I WOULD JUST --

02:15:36.695 --> 02:15:37.929
I WOULD OFFER.

ASSISTANCE AS YOU GO FORWARD ON

02:15:40.565 --> 02:15:42.167
MY AND I'M SURE MANY OTHER

02:15:42.234 --> 02:15:46.705
MEMBERS HERE IF WHAT COMES BACK --

02:15:46.771 --> 02:15:48.039
SAFE FROM THE UTILITIES FOR

02:15:48.106 --> 02:15:50.542
THEIR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS

02:15:50.609 --> 02:15:53.078
ISN'T IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH OR IF

02:15:53.144 --> 02:15:54.880
THEY'RE IN TOO MUCH OF A FOXHOLE

02:15:54.946 --> 02:15:57.315
FRANKLY RIGHT NOW TO THINK AHEAD.

02:15:57.382 --> 02:15:58.617
WHERE THEIR BALANCE SHEETS ARE

02:15:58.683 --> 02:16:00.952
THREATENED OR THEY MAY NOT KNOW

02:16:01.019 --> 02:16:02.220
IT DO THEY EVEN WANT TO BE IN

02:16:02.287 --> 02:16:04.322
THE PROCUREMENT BUSINESS AT ALL

02:16:04.389 --> 02:16:08.093
WE'RE HEARING SOME OF THEM DON'T --

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:08.793
IT THERE THERE'S SORT OF AN

02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:10.228
INHERENTLY DEFENSIVE POSTURE

02:16:10.295 --> 02:16:12.264
RIGHT NOW AND SO I'LL BE CURIOUS

02:16:12.330 --> 02:16:13.832
TO SEE WHAT THOSE PLANS LOOK

02:16:13.899 --> 02:16:15.300
LIKE BUT I THINK.

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:16.401
THERE MAY BE SOME THINGS THAT

02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:18.603
THEY JUST CAN'T EVEN DO ON THEIR

02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:19.871
OWN AND THAT THE STATE MAY HAVE

02:16:19.938 --> 02:16:21.373
TO COME UP WITH SOME CREATIVE

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:24.743
NEW WAYS. TO TO TO CUT THAT RISK

02:16:24.809 --> 02:16:26.144
BACK MAY I WONDER.

02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:28.213
YOU KNOW WE LOST ALL

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:30.348
COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IN

02:16:30.415 --> 02:16:32.050
A HUGE.

02:16:32.117 --> 02:16:33.985
SWATH OF TERRITORY DOWN LA

02:16:34.052 --> 02:16:35.921
VENTURA COUNTY --%

02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:37.389
WHICH AFFECTED BOTH YOUR FOLKS

ON THE GROUND AS WELL AS

02:16:39.090 --> 02:16:41.026
RESIDENTS TRY TO DEAL WITH

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:43.495
EVACUATION --

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:44.963
IT'S A SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:46.565
REALLY THAT WE'RE SEEING WHERE.

02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:49.200
BACKUP POWERS MAYBE NOT THERE OR

02:16:49.267 --> 02:16:51.102
THE THE INFRASTRUCTURES GETTING

02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:52.404

THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE AND

02:16:58.043 --> 02:17:00.478
MAYBE SOME LESSONS WE LEARNED

02:17:00.545 --> 02:17:03.014
FROM THAT.

02:17:03.081 --> 02:17:05.183
WELL I'M JUST AN AIRY I GOT I

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:06.785
GUESS THIS FOCUS ON SOMETHING

THAT REALLY IS CRITICAL TO ALL

02:17:08.687 --> 02:17:10.789
OF US NOW AND AND IT'S SOMETHING

LATE MORNING AND THAT IS.

02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:21.566
CELL PHONES AND AND YOU KNOW

02:17:21.633 --> 02:17:22.968
WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN TO THAT

02:17:23.034 --> 02:17:25.170
LEVEL THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVE AND

02:17:25.236 --> 02:17:26.838

THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES

02:17:29.774 --> 02:17:31.643
DATA INTO THE CELL PHONES THAT

02:17:31.710 --> 02:17:33.812
INFORMATION MOVING THE THE

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:35.780
SIGNALS FOR MARTIN WARNING --

02:17:35.847 --> 02:17:37.682
ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO HAVE THAT

02:17:37.749 --> 02:17:39.050
FOR GOING TO DEPEND A FOR FOR

02:17:39.117 --> 02:17:40.218

BASKET WE NEED TO HAVE THAT.

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:47.092
SYSTEM RESILIENT NOW.

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.326
NOT EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT AS

FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE SITES

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:28.193

TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES.

02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:45.877
WERE JUST AS BAD AND AND SO WE

02:19:45.944 --> 02:19:47.579
THAT'S A BIG DEAL BECAUSE WE

02:19:47.645 --> 02:19:48.213
BECAUSE OF FOR DOING EVACUATION

02:19:48.279 --> 02:19:49.013

TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN

02:21:37.388 --> 02:21:37.722
BE.

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:39.057
AS COMPREHENSIVE AS THEY NEED TO

02:21:39.123 --> 02:21:42.093

PROCESS I THINK WE AT THIS POINT

02:21:49.834 --> 02:21:51.436
JUST WANTED TO SORT OF RAISE

02:21:51.502 --> 02:21:53.805
THIS IDEA OF YOU MIGHT WANT TO

02:21:53.872 --> 02:21:55.306
START WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF

02:21:55.373 --> 02:21:57.275
WHERE THE CAPACITY IS AND WHERE

02:21:57.342 --> 02:21:58.409
THE GAPS ARE.

02:21:58.476 --> 02:22:00.144
AND AND IT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO

02:22:00.211 --> 02:22:01.412

AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT

02:22:07.752 --> 02:22:09.854
YOU CAN DO JUST BETWEEN CAL FIRE

02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:11.289
IN -- YES ON

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:12.657
THIS SORT OF DIRECT FIRE

02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:15.293
SUPPRESSION RESPONSE TIME AS

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:16.427

SENSE TO ADD A CAL FIRE ENGINE

02:22:28.006 --> 02:22:29.841
VERSES MORE MUTUAL AID RESOURCES

02:22:29.908 --> 02:22:31.643

02:22:31.709 --> 02:22:32.510
IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY

02:22:32.577 --> 02:22:33.778

HOW THAT THAT THAT THAT SORT OF

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:40.218
ASSESSMENT WOULD BE COORDINATED --

02:24:04.702 --> 02:24:06.838
ALL OF THE EXPERTS WHO'VE BEEN

02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:10.842
PARTICIPATING SO FAR --

02:24:10.908 --> 02:24:11.542
ONE IN.

02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:13.511
FIVE I HAVE A NUMBER OF

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:15.413
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AROUND

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:16.848
OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND OTHER

02:24:16.914 --> 02:24:21.019
THINGS BUT I JUST WANTED --

02:24:21.085 --> 02:24:22.120
TO COUNTER DOOR VICE CHAIRS

02:24:22.186 --> 02:24:24.222
ASSERTION THAT ARE IN MADE FIRE

02:24:24.288 --> 02:24:25.990
CREWS ARE LESS RELIABLE I DON'T

02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:28.092
THINK WE'VE THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE

02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:29.527
THUS FAR.

02:24:29.594 --> 02:24:30.628
THAT THOSE CREWS ARE LESS

02:24:30.695 --> 02:24:33.097
RELIABLE AND I THINK IN FACT.

02:24:33.164 --> 02:24:34.565
WE HAVE RELIED ON THEM QUITE

02:24:34.632 --> 02:24:36.034
EXTENSIVELY.

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:38.803
IN ALL OF THE FIRE RESPONSES

02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:40.304
ENDS NOT ONLY IN THE FIRE

02:24:40.371 --> 02:24:41.572
RESPONSES.

02:24:41.639 --> 02:24:43.374
LAST COUPLE OF REALLY TRAGIC

02:24:43.441 --> 02:24:47.245
YEARS BUT ALSO IN OUR OF FIRE

02:24:47.311 --> 02:24:49.614
SUPPRESSION.

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:52.984
ACTIVITIES IN A AND I DON'T KNOW

02:24:53.051 --> 02:24:58.356
IF -- T.

02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:00.058
POOR IF YOU WONDER REFERENCE

02:25:00.124 --> 02:25:03.694
THAT IT ALL BUT AS FAR AS A

02:25:03.761 --> 02:25:06.597
QUALITY OF A CREW --

02:25:06.664 --> 02:25:08.032
ARE ARE IN MAKE CREWS --

02:25:08.099 --> 02:25:11.369
INDIVIDUALLY EACH ONE OF THEM IS

02:25:11.436 --> 02:25:13.971
A TYPE ONE HIGH QUALITY CREW.

02:25:14.038 --> 02:25:18.009
AND THE FIGHT FIRE ALONG SIDE.

02:25:18.076 --> 02:25:19.710
HOT SHOTS AND ALL THE ALL THE

02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:22.013
HARDEST WORKING --

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.581
FIREFIGHTERS OUT THERE.

02:25:23.648 --> 02:25:27.885
THERE THERE LED BY OUR OUR

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:29.754
CALIFORNIA CAPTAINS LETTER THAT

02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:30.688
ARE LEADING THEM.

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:33.357
BUT THEY ARE VERY HARD WORKING --

02:25:33.424 --> 02:25:35.193
CREWMEMBERS.

02:25:35.259 --> 02:25:35.927
EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM NOW.

02:25:35.993 --> 02:25:41.699
THE IT'S KIND OF COMES --

02:25:41.766 --> 02:25:43.067
TO HOW MANY WE HAVE IN THE

02:25:43.134 --> 02:25:44.569
SYSTEM AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE

02:25:44.635 --> 02:25:46.370
THOUSAND INMATES SHORT OF OUR OF

02:25:46.437 --> 02:25:49.574
OUR NEED TO HAVE ALL OF OUR

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:51.375
CREWS COVERED AND THAT'S THAT'S

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:52.643
WHERE THE WEAKNESSES WERE

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:55.780
RELATED TO INMATES IT'S IN THAT.

02:25:55.847 --> 02:25:58.449
OF OF THE SYSTEM TO SUPPLY US

02:25:58.516 --> 02:26:01.586
WITH ELIGIBLE INMATES --

02:26:01.652 --> 02:26:03.888
TO TO THE PROGRAM SO THE CCC

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:06.224
CREWS ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE.

02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:08.426
EQUALLY AS AS STRONG AND HARD

02:26:08.493 --> 02:26:10.895
WORKING AS INDIVIDUAL CRUZ IT'S

02:26:10.962 --> 02:26:12.697
JUST THE THE CAPACITY OF AN A

02:26:12.763 --> 02:26:14.832
NUMBERS ISSUE BUT CERTAINLY NOT

02:26:14.899 --> 02:26:18.469
A THE LIABILITY ISSUE --

02:26:18.536 --> 02:26:22.440
SO THEN I I EIGHT I THINK. ONE

02:26:22.507 --> 02:26:26.110
OF THE STRUGGLES THAT FOR THE

02:26:26.177 --> 02:26:28.112
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE.

02:26:28.179 --> 02:26:31.582
IS GIVEN THE THE CHALLENGES WERE

02:26:31.649 --> 02:26:33.117
FACING [inaudible]

02:26:33.184 --> 02:26:36.154
KNOWING THAT.

02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:37.822
THIS PRESENCE OF FIRE AND VERY

02:26:37.889 --> 02:26:39.290
CATASTROPHIC FIRES IS GONNA BE

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:41.759
CONTINUAL.

02:26:41.826 --> 02:26:43.494
WHERE DO WE PUT?

02:26:43.561 --> 02:26:46.230
OUR RESOURCES AND I APPRECIATE.

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:47.431
THAT -- FROM

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:48.900
CAL FIRES POINT OF VIEW YOU

02:26:48.966 --> 02:26:51.002
DON'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN.

02:26:51.068 --> 02:26:53.271
THE FORESTER THE WILD FIRE FIRE

02:26:53.337 --> 02:26:54.739
VERSUS THOSE THAT HAVE OCCURRED

02:26:54.805 --> 02:26:57.642
IN OUR WILD LANDS URBAN

02:26:57.708 --> 02:26:59.944
INTERFACE --

02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:01.979
BUT I THINK.

02:27:02.046 --> 02:27:03.848
I AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR

02:27:03.915 --> 02:27:08.819
OPINIONS BUT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE

02:27:08.886 --> 02:27:09.820
FROM A FIRE ECOLOGY POINT OF

02:27:09.887 --> 02:27:11.822
VIEW.

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:15.660
NOT MANAGED OUR FOREST LANDS.

02:27:15.726 --> 02:27:17.428
IN A WAY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:27:17.495 --> 02:27:19.964
OPTIMAL FOR FIRE REDUCTION FOR A

02:27:20.031 --> 02:27:21.999
VERY LONG TIME.

02:27:22.066 --> 02:27:25.736
AND IT SEEMS AND ALSO SO MUCH OF

02:27:25.803 --> 02:27:27.238
THOSE THAT THAT ACREAGE IS.

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:29.273
FEDERAL.

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:33.044
THAT TO ACCOMPLISH THE TYPE OF

02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:34.946
FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITY IN

02:27:35.012 --> 02:27:36.514
THOSE LANDS.

02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:38.583
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WOULD

02:27:38.649 --> 02:27:39.250
BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT.

02:27:39.317 --> 02:27:41.319
NOW.

02:27:41.385 --> 02:27:44.121
THE OBVIOUSLY THE IMPACT OF

02:27:44.188 --> 02:27:45.990
THOSE FIRES SO THE MENDOCINO

02:27:46.057 --> 02:27:48.559
COMPLEX FIRE WAS MANY MORE ACRES

02:27:48.626 --> 02:27:49.594
THAN THE OTHER FIRES THAT WE'VE

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:50.928
EXPERIENCED.

02:27:50.995 --> 02:27:52.797
SO IT WAS VERY BAD FROM A CARBON

02:27:52.863 --> 02:27:54.565
POINT OF VIEW IN VERY BAD FOR ME --

02:27:54.632 --> 02:27:55.666
QUALITY POINT OF VIEW THOUGH

02:27:55.733 --> 02:27:57.602
MAYBE AIR QUALITY NOT AS BAD AS

02:27:57.668 --> 02:28:00.504
THE URBAN --

02:28:00.571 --> 02:28:02.006
INTERFACE ONCE BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:06.277
PUTTING A DIFFERENT SET OF OF

02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:07.979
PARTICULATE MATTER AND CHEMICALS

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:09.313
INTO THE YEAR WHEN YOU'RE

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:11.082
BURNING THINGS THAT HUMANS HAVE

02:28:11.148 --> 02:28:13.818
STARTED TO AFFECT VERSES.

02:28:13.884 --> 02:28:16.354
OF TREES AND SCRUB AND SUCH

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:16.654
[inaudible]

02:28:16.721 --> 02:28:22.026
ON BUT THE COST TO US FOR IN

02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:23.628
TERMS OF PROPERTY.

02:28:23.694 --> 02:28:25.263
IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC LOSSES IN

02:28:25.329 --> 02:28:27.164
CLEAN UP ND OF COURSE HUMAN%

02:28:27.231 --> 02:28:30.067
LIVES IS FAR GREATER.

02:28:30.134 --> 02:28:33.170
IN OUR INTERFACE AREAS.

02:28:33.237 --> 02:28:36.374
AND THE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:38.175
WHILE IT IS PRIVATE PROPERTY IN

02:28:38.242 --> 02:28:39.977
MANY CASES IT SEEMS LIKE WE

02:28:40.044 --> 02:28:42.747
MIGHT HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY. TO

02:28:42.813 --> 02:28:46.917
DO MORE WORK TO ME TO LESSEN.

02:28:46.984 --> 02:28:49.353
THE FIRES THERE THEN.

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:54.025
PUTTING OVER EMPHASIS ON BE --

02:28:54.091 --> 02:28:56.560
FORCE MANAGEMENT AND I I'D LIKE

02:28:56.627 --> 02:28:59.297
TO HEAR --

02:28:59.363 --> 02:29:00.364
I'D LIKE SOME SPEED.

02:29:00.431 --> 02:29:01.632
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A

02:29:01.699 --> 02:29:05.169
CONCLUSION BY ANY MEANS OUR WE

02:29:05.236 --> 02:29:06.771
WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES SO

02:29:06.837 --> 02:29:08.406
WHAT IS OUR BEST FROM A

02:29:08.472 --> 02:29:09.907
STRATEGIC PLANNING POINT OF VIEW

02:29:09.974 --> 02:29:12.243
WHAT IS THE BEST PLACE. TO

02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:14.712
DIRECT THOSE RESOURCES

02:29:14.779 --> 02:29:15.012
[inaudible]

02:29:15.079 --> 02:29:18.716
AND I'M GONNA START THE ANSWER

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:21.218
WITH IT'S COMPLICATED --

02:29:21.285 --> 02:29:22.687
A REALLY IS --

02:29:22.753 --> 02:29:26.157
BECAUSE WELL IN THAT THAT

02:29:26.223 --> 02:29:29.193
INTERFACE AREA WE HAVE A LOT

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:30.828
MORE POINTS OF NEED OF

02:29:30.895 --> 02:29:33.931
PROTECTION.

02:29:33.998 --> 02:29:36.200
THE COST AND HIGHER COSTS TO DO

02:29:36.267 --> 02:29:38.969
SO AND HIGHER COST OF LOS.

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:40.738
ALL ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ARE

02:29:40.805 --> 02:29:41.972
THERE -- AND

02:29:42.039 --> 02:29:44.842
AND THAT IS NEEDS TO BE --

02:29:44.909 --> 02:29:48.145
A ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES --

02:29:48.212 --> 02:29:50.614
THE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS IS

02:29:50.681 --> 02:29:53.651
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE START TO GET --

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:54.719
TO WHAT YOU REFERRED TO

02:29:54.785 --> 02:29:55.219
PREVIOUSLY --

02:29:55.286 --> 02:29:58.122
A MORE HEALTHY FOREST ECOSYSTEM

02:29:58.189 --> 02:29:59.390
STATE.

02:29:59.457 --> 02:30:01.359
MORE OF AN ABILITY FOR OUR

02:30:01.425 --> 02:30:03.627
FOREST LANDS TO BE ABLE.

02:30:03.694 --> 02:30:06.063
TO HANDLE NATURAL AND NON

02:30:06.130 --> 02:30:08.165
NATURAL STARTS OF FIRES AND AND

02:30:08.232 --> 02:30:10.868
ALLOW MAY BE SOME MORE ACRES TO

02:30:10.935 --> 02:30:12.536
BE BURNED IN A HEALTHY.

02:30:12.603 --> 02:30:14.739
WAY -- WHICH

02:30:14.805 --> 02:30:17.007
SHOULD TO ALL OF THE FIRST

02:30:17.074 --> 02:30:19.343
COMPARED.

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:22.012
TO THE V. FOUR WE AREA YES

02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:23.347
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:25.282
INTERMIX AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:27.151
RIGHT THAT'S AND THAT'S

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:29.420
PRIMARILY WHERE ARE OUR ENGINES

02:30:29.487 --> 02:30:30.721
ARE.

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:33.557
CURRENTLY AND OUR OUR ASSESSMENT

02:30:33.624 --> 02:30:37.128
WILL LOOK AT THEY NEED --

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:39.663
TO ADD ENGINES IN IN THOSE KIND

02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:42.233
OF WE WE OR INTERMIX AREAS

02:30:42.299 --> 02:30:43.634
BECAUSE REALLY THAT IS SO I'M

02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:45.236
THINKING OF PREVENTION NOW

02:30:45.302 --> 02:30:46.937
VERSUS JUST I UNDERSTAND AND

02:30:47.004 --> 02:30:47.972
THEY AND THEY ARE PREVENTION

02:30:48.038 --> 02:30:49.774
OKAY SO THOSE THOSE ENGINES ARE

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:52.143
THERE. TO SUPPRESS FIRES AND

02:30:52.209 --> 02:30:53.043
THEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT

02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:54.445
SUPPRESSING FIRES THERE

02:30:54.512 --> 02:30:55.846
PREVENTION REMEMBER AND I AND I

02:30:55.913 --> 02:30:59.984
AND AND I'M GONNA WORK ON ON ON

02:31:00.050 --> 02:31:01.452
KIND OF MORE ARTICULATING THE

02:31:01.519 --> 02:31:03.554
THE PERCENTAGES OF OF TEIR THAT

02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:05.489
WORKLOAD THAT THAT THEY'RE

02:31:05.556 --> 02:31:06.023
PROVIDING --

02:31:06.090 --> 02:31:07.391
IN THAT --

02:31:07.458 --> 02:31:09.493
FOR YOU FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE --

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:14.398
BUT WELL WELL WE WHAT WE'RE

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:18.002
WORKING ON ALL OF THESE THINGS --

02:31:18.068 --> 02:31:20.471
AND AND THEN I'M GONNA COME BACK

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:21.639
TO CRUISE ON THAT.

02:31:21.705 --> 02:31:23.641
SO THERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF

02:31:23.707 --> 02:31:26.343
WHY WE NEED MORE OF OUR OUR FREE

02:31:26.410 --> 02:31:27.778
FIREFIGHTER CREWS WHETHER

02:31:27.845 --> 02:31:30.214
THEY'RE THE CCC WHETHER THEIR

02:31:30.281 --> 02:31:32.349
FUTURE CAL FIRE FIRE FIGHTER

02:31:32.416 --> 02:31:33.150
CREW.

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:34.752
THOSE ARE THE CREWS THAT CAN

02:31:34.819 --> 02:31:36.120
WORK IN THOSE INTERFACE OR IF

02:31:36.187 --> 02:31:38.222
THOSE INTERMIX AREAS WE WE WE

02:31:38.289 --> 02:31:40.024
ARE RIGHT NOW IT IT'S IT'S NOT

02:31:40.090 --> 02:31:42.326
SAFE TO PUT INMATES IN SOME

02:31:42.393 --> 02:31:43.627
SITUATIONS.

02:31:43.694 --> 02:31:45.129
AND SO WE NEED THOSE FOR FREE

02:31:45.196 --> 02:31:47.398
FIREFIGHTERS IN IN THE MIX IN

02:31:47.465 --> 02:31:49.400
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WORK

02:31:49.467 --> 02:31:51.702
AND THAT'S GROWING THAT PROGRAM

02:31:51.769 --> 02:31:54.505
WILL ALLOW US --

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:56.874
WORK IN THAT THAT WILDLAND URBAN

02:31:56.941 --> 02:31:59.009
INTERFACE AND URBAN INTERMIX

02:31:59.076 --> 02:32:00.744
AREA -- TO

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:02.313
DO MORE OF THE PREVENTION WORK --

02:32:02.379 --> 02:32:04.315
DOING PRESCRIBED FIRE IN THOSE

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:06.350
AREAS IS VERY TEDIOUS BECAUSE

02:32:06.417 --> 02:32:08.519
ESPECIALLY UNTIL WE DO ENOUGH OF

02:32:08.586 --> 02:32:10.020
THIS OTHER TYPE OF WORK TO GET

02:32:10.087 --> 02:32:11.622
TO A STATE WHERE WE CAN.

02:32:11.689 --> 02:32:14.024
PUT FIRE ON THE GROUND SAFELY --

02:32:14.091 --> 02:32:15.659
AND WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT'S

02:32:15.726 --> 02:32:17.394
GOING TO ACCEPT FIRE ON THE

02:32:17.461 --> 02:32:18.963
GROUND --

02:32:19.029 --> 02:32:20.364
THEN.

02:32:20.431 --> 02:32:22.099
WE'LL GET TO THAT AS WELL THESE

02:32:22.166 --> 02:32:24.068
OUR FUTURE STATES AND I THINK

02:32:24.134 --> 02:32:25.970
FIVE YEARS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT --

02:32:26.036 --> 02:32:28.472
SHORT SENATOR STERN ON ON

02:32:28.539 --> 02:32:30.274
TURNING THE THE TABLES BUT WE'RE

02:32:30.341 --> 02:32:31.442
GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY

02:32:31.509 --> 02:32:33.777
CAN. TO TO SHORTEN THAT TIME

02:32:33.844 --> 02:32:35.045
LINE -- BUT

02:32:35.112 --> 02:32:36.347
WE'RE WE REALLY ARE TALKING

02:32:36.413 --> 02:32:37.882
ABOUT DECADES THIS IS THIS IS A

02:32:37.948 --> 02:32:39.283
SEA CHANGE AND I THINK YOU'VE

02:32:39.350 --> 02:32:40.985
YOU'VE HIT ON IT WITH THE THE

02:32:41.051 --> 02:32:42.653
PREVENTION AND THE KIND OF THE

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:45.022
PRE FIRE AND AND MANAGEMENT OF

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:46.790
AND FOCUSING ON THE AREAS WHERE

02:32:46.857 --> 02:32:47.858
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THAT.

02:32:47.925 --> 02:32:50.094
THE PEOPLE FIRST BUT WE ALSO

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:51.996
NEED TO LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF

02:32:52.062 --> 02:32:52.930
THE FOREST AND THAT'S PART OF IT

02:32:52.997 --> 02:32:54.698
YOU'VE BEEN FOCUSING SO FAR AND

02:32:54.765 --> 02:32:55.165
WHAT [inaudible]

02:32:55.232 --> 02:32:56.500
THE STATE.

02:32:56.567 --> 02:32:58.435
AGENCIES WOULD DO AND I WONDER

02:32:58.502 --> 02:33:00.871
IF WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING MORE.

02:33:00.938 --> 02:33:02.673
AT WHAT WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING

02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:06.610
FROM OUR PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS.

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:08.979
AND FROM POTENTIALLY OUR LOCAL

02:33:09.046 --> 02:33:10.948
GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS --

02:33:11.015 --> 02:33:13.183
AND I SAY THAT AS REPRESENTATIVE%

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:15.886
OF THE AREA WHERE BEFORE.

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:18.489
THE TUBS AND CAMPFIRE HAD THE

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:21.158
WORST FIRE WITH THE MOST LOSS OF

02:33:21.225 --> 02:33:22.426
STRUCTURES AND LYFT WHICH WAS

02:33:22.493 --> 02:33:25.462
THE OAKLAND BERKELEY TUNNEL FIRE.

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:29.033
AND WE STILL HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE

02:33:29.099 --> 02:33:31.302
WHERE WE HAVE MANY PROPERTY

02:33:31.368 --> 02:33:32.903
OWNERS WHO ARE NOT WE HAVE.

02:33:32.970 --> 02:33:34.605
LAWS AND RULES EACH OF OUR

02:33:34.672 --> 02:33:35.873
JURISDICTIONS.

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:37.675
THAT ARE IMPACTEDOF LAWS RULES

02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:39.910
AROUND DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

02:33:39.977 --> 02:33:41.545
AND BUILD OF OPPRESSION SUCH AND

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:42.479
YET.

02:33:42.546 --> 02:33:47.551
IT IT'S YEAH EXACTLY TO THE IT

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:50.020
MAY BE BETTER THAN OTHER PLACES

02:33:50.087 --> 02:33:51.021
I DON'T KNOW NOT FULLY.

02:33:51.088 --> 02:33:51.822
NOT WHERE WE SHOULD BE.

02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:53.724
AND OF COURSE.

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:55.259
WE ALLOWED FOR THE COMPLETE

02:33:55.326 --> 02:33:57.294
REBUILT.

02:33:57.361 --> 02:33:59.697
IN ALL THE AREAS THAT WERE WHERE

02:33:59.763 --> 02:34:01.865
AND THAT FIRE WAS NOT THE FIRST

02:34:01.932 --> 02:34:04.868
FIRE SO IT --

02:34:04.935 --> 02:34:06.503
BUT I HAVE A TWO OTHER COMMENTS

02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:07.705
ABOUT SOME MATERIAL THAT WAS IN

02:34:07.771 --> 02:34:10.841
OUR DOCUMENTS BUT JUST ANY OTHER.

02:34:10.908 --> 02:34:13.711
ANY FROM OUR PANELIST ON WHETHER

02:34:13.777 --> 02:34:16.614
WE SHOULD BE PUTTING SOME MORE.

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:21.018
EXPECTATIONS ON TO ASSIST US.

02:34:21.085 --> 02:34:22.586
YOU WANTED TO TAKE THE FIRST --

02:34:22.653 --> 02:34:24.622
YES WELL I I'M JUST TO SAY I

02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:26.957
LIKE I SAID I AGREE WITH YOU ON

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:27.858
THIS THIS HAS TO BE --

02:34:27.925 --> 02:34:28.792
A WHOLE COMMUNITY APPROACH IT

02:34:28.859 --> 02:34:30.794
IT'S NOT JUST A CAL FIRE ISSUE

02:34:30.861 --> 02:34:32.396
RIGHT OR STATE ISSUE.

02:34:32.463 --> 02:34:34.331
YOU KNOW WE PUSH OUT HAZARD

02:34:34.398 --> 02:34:36.834
MITIGATION GRANTS TO LOCAL

02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:38.869
GOVERNMENTS --

02:34:38.936 --> 02:34:40.938
IN GENERAL AS AS A STATE IS YOUR

02:34:41.005 --> 02:34:42.539
RISKIEST CALIFORNIA AS WE WE

02:34:42.606 --> 02:34:43.574
NEED TO REINFORCE WHAT I CALL

02:34:43.641 --> 02:34:45.275
CULTURE PREPAREDNESS THAT THAT'S

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:46.710
GOING TO BE ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF

02:34:46.777 --> 02:34:48.078
GOVERNMENT RIGHT.

02:34:48.145 --> 02:34:49.613
AND AND IT SPEAKS TO WHAT YOU'RE

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:50.714
TALKING ABOUT AFTER THE OAKLAND

02:34:50.781 --> 02:34:52.282
HILLS FIRE IF YOU DRIVE UP IN

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:54.351
THE SAME HILLS TODAY.

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:55.119
IT'S IT'S GOT A WEIRD TO THINK

02:34:55.185 --> 02:34:56.353
THAT YOU WE WILL BE BACK AT THE

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:58.722
SAME PLACE YEAH PRETTY FIRE

02:34:58.789 --> 02:35:01.091
AFTER A NINETY TWO PEOPLE SO I I

02:35:01.158 --> 02:35:01.992
THINK THAT THAT.

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:04.828
REALLY NEEDS TO BE ALL YOU KNOW

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:06.163
JUST LIKE OUR SAYS CENTER STERN --

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:11.902
PUBLIC PRIVATE NON GOVERNMENTAL

02:35:11.969 --> 02:35:13.103
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO SOLVE IT

02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:13.704
TODAY.

02:35:13.771 --> 02:35:14.705
IS WHAT.

02:35:14.772 --> 02:35:16.874
ARE AGENCIES WOULD RECOMMEND

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:18.375
THAT IF THERE'S SOMETING THAT

02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:20.310
WE NEED TO ENACT BECAUSE YES

02:35:20.377 --> 02:35:22.079
IT'S A AND I DON'T MEAN THIS IS

02:35:22.146 --> 02:35:22.446
NOT.

02:35:22.513 --> 02:35:24.148
IS LOVELY TO SAY WE NEED THIS

02:35:24.214 --> 02:35:25.416
WHOLE.

02:35:25.482 --> 02:35:26.316
PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP

02:35:26.383 --> 02:35:28.218
EVERYBODY ON BUT BUT WHAT IS IT

02:35:28.285 --> 02:35:30.754
THAT WE NEED TO DO WHEN WE THE

02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:32.056
DEFINITION OF CRAZINESS AS THEY

02:35:32.122 --> 02:35:33.624
SAY IS TO CONTINUE TO DO THE

02:35:33.691 --> 02:35:34.725
SAME THING THAT DOESN'T.

02:35:34.792 --> 02:35:38.162
PRODUCE THE RESULTS SO.

02:35:38.228 --> 02:35:39.763
ANY RECOMMENDATIONS AN INSIGHT

02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:41.065
ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US

02:35:41.131 --> 02:35:43.367
AND THAT BRINGS UP MY NEXT POINT

02:35:43.434 --> 02:35:45.069
WHICH IS WHEN I LOOK AT THIS

02:35:45.135 --> 02:35:46.203
DOCUMENT.

02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:47.705
WHERE WE ARE GIVEN?

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:51.041
THE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT.

02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:54.244
FROM.

02:35:54.311 --> 02:35:54.845
NINETEEN NINETY TO TWENTY TEN

02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:56.280
DEVELOPMENT WITHIN OUR WILDLAND

02:35:56.346 --> 02:35:59.349
URBAN INTERFACE GROUP 20%.

02:35:59.416 --> 02:36:01.585
AND A COURSES I JUST START YOU

02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:04.054
STATED EVEN IN MY AREA IT WAS

02:36:04.121 --> 02:36:05.923
QUICKLY REBUILT.

02:36:05.989 --> 02:36:08.926
BUT THEN ADDITIONALLY ON PAGE.

02:36:08.992 --> 02:36:10.694
FOUR OF OUR DOCUMENTS IT SAYS

02:36:10.761 --> 02:36:12.362
THAT ACCORDING TO A UCLA STUDY

02:36:12.429 --> 02:36:14.131
AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION NEW

02:36:14.198 --> 02:36:16.467
HOMES ARE EXPECTED TO BE BUILT

02:36:16.533 --> 02:36:18.268
IN THE HIGH RISK WILDFIRES ZONES

02:36:18.335 --> 02:36:19.002
AND I'M SURE.

02:36:19.069 --> 02:36:21.405
THAT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THREE

02:36:21.472 --> 02:36:22.473
PLACEMENT OF THE ONES WHO WERE

02:36:22.539 --> 02:36:23.640
JUST BURKE BURN OUT.

02:36:23.707 --> 02:36:25.175
AND I'M LIKE OKAY AT WHAT POINT

02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:28.178
DO WE THAT.

02:36:28.245 --> 02:36:30.414
WE MAY HAVE TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY.

02:36:30.481 --> 02:36:32.316
AND THAT'S WITH EVERY BIT OF

02:36:32.382 --> 02:36:35.052
COMPASSION TO FOLKS THAT.

02:36:35.119 --> 02:36:36.553
HAVE YOU KNOW.

02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:38.789
LOST THEIR LOST LOVED ONES LOST

02:36:38.856 --> 02:36:41.325
PROPERTY LOSS IT'S JUST THAT WE

02:36:41.391 --> 02:36:42.893
I MEAN IF WE LOOK FOR EXAMPLE

02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:45.429
AND THE CAMPFIRE.

02:36:45.496 --> 02:36:48.999
THERE ALREADY WAS REPORT THAT.

02:36:49.066 --> 02:36:50.400
WHEN THE POPULATION THERE WAS?

02:36:50.467 --> 02:36:53.270
WAS A THIRD OF WHAT IT HAD BEEN.

02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:55.639
THAT THE THERE WAS ALREADY ALL

02:36:55.706 --> 02:36:57.441
OF THE DATA TO SHOW THE DANGER

02:36:57.508 --> 02:36:58.942
SIGNALS OF THE FACT THAT THERE

02:36:59.009 --> 02:37:00.077
WAS ONLY ONE ROAD.

02:37:00.144 --> 02:37:01.879
THROUGH THE AREA AND THE DANGER

02:37:01.945 --> 02:37:03.881
SIGNALS NOT ONLY OF ACCESS FOR

02:37:03.947 --> 02:37:05.482
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL BUT THE

02:37:05.549 --> 02:37:06.884
ABILITY FOR PEOPLE.

02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:08.685
IN THE EMERGENCY TO BE ABLE TO

02:37:08.752 --> 02:37:09.520
GET OUT.

02:37:09.586 --> 02:37:13.023
SO I THINK WE WE HAVE.

02:37:13.090 --> 02:37:15.392
TO WE CAN'T JUST BE IN REACTIVE

02:37:15.459 --> 02:37:17.361
MODE WE'VE GOT TO PUT SOME

02:37:17.427 --> 02:37:20.097
THINGS INTO PLACE. TO HELP

02:37:20.164 --> 02:37:24.701
MINIMIZE THIS EXPOSURE COST AND

02:37:24.768 --> 02:37:26.303
AND REAL CONSEQUENCES.

02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:30.641
PEOPLE LOST LIVES.

02:37:30.707 --> 02:37:33.010
A REAL RELATED TO A LOT OF THAT

02:37:33.076 --> 02:37:34.578
IS LAND USE PLANNING --

02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:37.381
AND IT'S IT'S WHAT WE CAN DO AT

02:37:37.447 --> 02:37:40.350
THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP INFORM.

02:37:40.417 --> 02:37:42.853
THE THE LOCALS AS I MENTIONED

02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:45.322
PREVIOUSLY WE HAVE WE HAVE THIS

02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:46.657
GROUP -- OUR

02:37:46.723 --> 02:37:49.026
LAND USE PLANNING GROUP THAT IS

02:37:49.092 --> 02:37:51.895
WORKING WITH ALL OF THE COUNTIES --

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:54.298
AND AND IT'S TAKEN SOME TIME BUT

02:37:54.364 --> 02:37:56.433
THE ACCEPTANCE OF OF THAT GROUP

02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:57.835
HAS HAS GROWN.

02:37:57.901 --> 02:37:59.336
EXPONENTIALLY IN THE LAST COUPLE

02:37:59.403 --> 02:38:01.805
OF YEARS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:03.807
AND WORKING WITH THE BOARD OF

02:38:03.874 --> 02:38:06.476
FORESTRY IN REVIEWING OF OF THE

02:38:06.543 --> 02:38:08.312
SAFETY ELEMENT.

02:38:08.378 --> 02:38:10.447
OF OF GENERAL PLANS AS THE

02:38:10.514 --> 02:38:11.915
GENERAL PLANS ARE BEING REVIEWED

02:38:11.982 --> 02:38:14.718
AND UPDATED IS KEY TO THAT BUT

02:38:14.785 --> 02:38:17.421
THEN ON THE RECOVERY.

02:38:17.487 --> 02:38:19.122
THAT GETS BACK IT'S TEDIOUS AND

02:38:19.189 --> 02:38:21.391
HANDED THERE IS OFTEN REQUESTS

02:38:21.458 --> 02:38:22.526
FOR WAIVERS.

02:38:22.593 --> 02:38:24.261
FROM SOME OF THESE VERY RULES

02:38:24.328 --> 02:38:25.762
AND AND THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING

02:38:25.829 --> 02:38:27.197
TO GET INTO GENERAL PLANS.

02:38:27.264 --> 02:38:28.265
THAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES TO

02:38:28.332 --> 02:38:32.236
SAVE PROPERTY --

02:38:32.302 --> 02:38:33.704
ANY AND IT'S EIGHT IT DOES

02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:35.839
INCREASE THE COST OF OF

02:38:35.906 --> 02:38:37.374
REBUILDING AND SO.

02:38:37.441 --> 02:38:38.642
THERE'S THERE'S A BALANCING ACT

02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:40.444
THERE THAT THAT REALLY PLAYS OUT

02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:42.679
AT A LOCAL LEVEL THAT THAT IS

02:38:42.746 --> 02:38:44.214
PART OF THIS EQUATION AS WELL I

02:38:44.281 --> 02:38:45.249
THINK.

02:38:45.315 --> 02:38:46.483
WHEN THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WE

02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:48.719
WOULD ENACT BUT I THINK IT'S

02:38:48.785 --> 02:38:49.353
WORTH IT FOR US TO GET

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:51.788
RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO WASTE

02:38:51.855 --> 02:38:54.091
BECAUSE THIS THE IMPACT TO THE

02:38:54.157 --> 02:38:56.026
STATE IS HUGE AND HAS?

02:38:56.093 --> 02:38:58.028
STATE LAWMAKERS WE SHOULD THINK

02:38:58.095 --> 02:38:59.563
ABOUT -- MY

02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:01.598
pFINAL QUESTION IN POINT IS

02:39:01.665 --> 02:39:02.966
THERE'S REFERENCE IN OUR

02:39:03.033 --> 02:39:04.434
DOCUMENTS AROUND THE NINE ONE

02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:06.169
ONE SYSTEM.

02:39:06.236 --> 02:39:08.138
AND I'M SURE WE'LL BE TALKING

02:39:08.205 --> 02:39:09.973
ABOUT THAT MORE OTHER TIMES BUT

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.509

IN THE STATE AND WE HAVE A

02:46:12.862 --> 02:46:14.431
SYSTEM THAT IS STRESSED --

UNDERSTAND WHERE EACH TREE

02:47:05.715 --> 02:47:07.650
GAZING ANYONE TIME --

02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:08.752
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE THE

02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:10.053
ALWAYS THE VAST MAJORITY OF

02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:11.521

02:51:41.124 --> 02:51:42.325
NUMBER --

02:51:42.392 --> 02:51:43.960
THAT EACH ENGINE IS PRETTY

02:51:55.438 --> 02:51:56.806
EACH ENGINE.

02:51:56.873 --> 02:51:58.541

02:52:07.784 --> 02:52:09.886
TO HOUSE THOSE --

02:52:09.952 --> 02:52:11.587
AS FAR AS DEPLOYMENT --

02:52:11.654 --> 02:52:13.189
IF WE WERE --

02:52:13.256 --> 02:52:15.391
TO LOOK AT THIRTY ONE ADDITIONAL

02:52:15.458 --> 02:52:17.293
ENGINES THAT WOULD. THIRTEEN OF

02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:20.329
THOSE WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT --

02:52:20.396 --> 02:52:21.597
THIRTY ONE THAT'S APPROXIMATELY

02:52:21.664 --> 02:52:24.534
AN ADDITIONAL. THIRTY WEEKS OF

02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:26.335
OF TRAINING THAT WE WOULD NEED

02:52:26.402 --> 02:52:27.537
FOR THE STAFF THAT WOULD BE THE

02:52:27.603 --> 02:52:29.939
COMPANY OFFICERS ON ON THAT THE

AND THAT'S THIRTY THIRTY WEEKS

02:52:34.177 --> 02:52:36.045
THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE --

02:52:36.112 --> 02:52:37.914
ALLOCATED OUR IN OUR CALENDAR

02:52:37.980 --> 02:52:39.949
CALENDARS FULL OF A WITH

02:52:40.016 --> 02:52:42.452
TRAINING NEEDS WE COULD DIVERT

02:52:42.518 --> 02:52:45.421
AND AND CHANGE SOME OF OUR SO WE

02:52:45.488 --> 02:52:47.790
COULD PROBABLY REDUCE THE WOULD

02:52:47.857 --> 02:52:49.258
NEED SOME SOME --

02:52:49.325 --> 02:52:50.760
TRAINING --

02:52:50.827 --> 02:52:51.494
COMPONENTS --

THAT DO --

02:53:37.073 --> 02:53:38.775
THEY DO A MISSION THAT THAT FEW

BUT THEY DON'T STAY OUT FOR

02:53:44.647 --> 02:53:45.982
FORTY FIVE DAYS --

02:53:46.048 --> 02:53:46.983
TYPICALLY IF THEY RE THEY ROTATE

02:53:47.049 --> 02:53:47.483
IN AND OUT.

02:53:47.550 --> 02:53:49.152
AND THAT'S PART OF OUR OUR

02:53:49.218 --> 02:53:50.553
HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM

02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:51.487

WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL FOR THE THE

02:54:02.031 --> 02:54:02.999
PREVIOUS LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR

02:54:03.065 --> 02:54:04.200
BROWN --

NEESON YOURSELF HAVE HAVE

02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:13.242
ADVANCED THIS BUDGET --

02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:13.876
IN THIS IS NOT AT ALL TRYING TO

02:54:13.943 --> 02:54:16.579
THROW STONES TO BE ABLE TO GET

02:54:16.646 --> 02:54:18.381
BACK TO WHERE WE WERE AND WHERE

02:54:18.447 --> 02:54:19.715
WE NEED TO BE --

02:54:19.782 --> 02:54:21.818
AS WE CONFRONT WHAT IS IN FRONT

02:54:21.884 --> 02:54:23.019
OF US NOW.

02:54:23.085 --> 02:54:25.588
IN IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED

02:54:25.655 --> 02:54:27.824
ENHANCE RESOURCES APPOINTMENT.

02:54:27.890 --> 02:54:29.859
PERSONNEL AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY

02:54:29.926 --> 02:54:31.527
TO BE A TO COMBAT THE REALITY

02:54:31.594 --> 02:54:34.497
THAT IS HERE IN.

02:54:34.564 --> 02:54:36.065
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO --

02:54:36.132 --> 02:54:37.967
WOULD LOVE IT WORKING OBVIOUSLY

02:54:38.034 --> 02:54:40.203
WITH THE BUDGET SUB CHAIR AND

02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:41.671
MADAM CHAIR HERE WITH BUDGET

02:54:41.737 --> 02:54:42.371
COMMITTEE.

02:54:42.438 --> 02:54:43.439
ON JUST GETTING A BETTER

02:54:43.506 --> 02:54:45.141
UNDERSTANDING.

02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:47.143
OF WHAT.

02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:48.277
IF THOSE NUMBERS THAT I HAD

02:54:48.344 --> 02:54:49.912
MENTIONED ARE STILL ACCURATE I

02:54:49.979 --> 02:54:51.113
DON'T NEED HIM NOWAND THEN THE

02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:52.849
OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS HOW

02:54:52.915 --> 02:54:55.351
LONG DOES IT TAKE. FOR AVERAGE

02:54:55.418 --> 02:54:57.119
ENGINE TO BE OUTFITTED.

02:54:57.186 --> 02:54:59.288
SO FROM START TO ACTUALLY ON THE

02:54:59.355 --> 02:55:01.390
STREET IS HOW LONG TWELVE MONTHS

02:55:01.457 --> 02:55:04.327
EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

02:55:04.393 --> 02:55:06.963
IT'S PROBABLY IT'S THE A A THIRD

02:55:07.029 --> 02:55:09.699
THERE'S ANOTHER IT'S COMPLICATED --

02:55:09.765 --> 02:55:12.034
WITH OUR WITH OUR PROCUREMENT

02:55:12.101 --> 02:55:13.569
PROCESS SOMETIMES THAT DELAYS

02:55:13.636 --> 02:55:14.904
THINGS -- IT

02:55:14.971 --> 02:55:16.639
IN ORDER TO GET INTO A CONTRACT

02:55:16.706 --> 02:55:17.974
PERIOD WHERE WE CAN FOR

02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:19.075
SKATEBOARDER THE ENGINE SO ONCE

02:55:19.141 --> 02:55:19.909
THE ORDER AND ONCE THE ENGINES

02:55:19.976 --> 02:55:21.744
ORDERED --

02:55:21.811 --> 02:55:24.480
WE CAN HAVE IT ON THE GROUND --

02:55:24.547 --> 02:55:27.483
DEPENDING ON AND OUTFITTED --

02:55:27.550 --> 02:55:30.486
THE THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT IS --

02:55:30.553 --> 02:55:32.555
IF WE'RE ORDERING A LOT OF

02:55:32.622 --> 02:55:35.057
ENGINES A BIG NUMBER THEN IT

02:55:35.124 --> 02:55:37.393
GETS STAGGERED OUT INTO.

02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:38.828
BUT EACH ONE FROM ONE ENGINE

02:55:38.895 --> 02:55:40.329
START TO FINISH WE WOULD EASILY

02:55:40.396 --> 02:55:41.397
HAVE IT.

02:55:41.464 --> 02:55:42.865
ON THE GROUND --

02:55:42.932 --> 02:55:44.200
OPERATIONAL WITHIN A YEAR

02:55:44.267 --> 02:55:44.500
[inaudible]

02:55:44.567 --> 02:55:46.702
THANK YOU.

02:55:46.769 --> 02:55:49.705
WE PUT ANY ITEMS IN TURN

02:55:49.772 --> 02:55:52.074
FINANCING ATTACHMENT.

02:55:52.141 --> 02:55:53.109
THANK YOU --

02:55:53.175 --> 02:55:56.412
SO.

02:55:56.479 --> 02:55:58.114
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT I GUESS

02:55:58.180 --> 02:56:00.383
TO RECOGNIZE IT I'VE KIND OF

02:56:00.449 --> 02:56:00.816
THREE POINTS ONE IS.

02:56:00.883 --> 02:56:02.451
ITS.

02:56:02.518 --> 02:56:03.786
THE FOCUS ON THE ENGINES IS

02:56:03.853 --> 02:56:05.855
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

02:56:05.922 --> 02:56:07.290
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:56:07.356 --> 02:56:08.658
UNDERSTAND IT'S ONE ELEMENT AS

02:56:08.724 --> 02:56:10.559
PART OF A CONFERENCE OF HOLISTIC

02:56:10.626 --> 02:56:12.228
PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS.

02:56:12.295 --> 02:56:15.064
SO IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT --

02:56:15.131 --> 02:56:17.366
WE DIDN'T HAVE --

02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:19.936
A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY STATE OF

02:56:20.002 --> 02:56:21.704
THE ART HELICOPTERS --

02:56:21.771 --> 02:56:24.540
THEY COULD FLY YOU AT NIGHT IN

02:56:24.607 --> 02:56:25.308
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE BUT WERE

02:56:25.374 --> 02:56:27.443
PROPOSING TO CONTINUE THAT WE

02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:28.711
DIDN'T HAVE --

02:56:28.778 --> 02:56:29.912
SEVENS.

02:56:29.979 --> 02:56:34.784
SEE ONE THIRTY FEDERAL OF AIR

02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:39.355
TANKERS TWENTY FIRST.

02:56:39.422 --> 02:56:39.989
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WE DIDN'T

02:56:40.056 --> 02:56:40.990
HAVE -- A

02:56:41.057 --> 02:56:42.491
FIRE DETECTION CAMERAS THAT ARE

02:56:42.558 --> 02:56:45.161
NOW CAN BE ABLE TO UTILIZE

02:56:45.227 --> 02:56:47.630
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY --

02:56:47.697 --> 02:56:50.199
IT TO BETTER ASSIST --

02:56:50.266 --> 02:56:52.635
FIRE DETECTION IN NINETEEN

02:56:52.702 --> 02:56:54.170
TWENTY FIVE EITHER SO.

02:56:54.236 --> 02:56:56.806
ARE ARE THINKING IN THIS PACKAGE.

02:56:56.872 --> 02:56:58.674
IS.

02:56:58.741 --> 02:57:01.744
IS IT MORE LOOKING FORWARD --

02:57:01.811 --> 02:57:03.913
TO S. T. PORTER MENTION IN THE

02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:06.048
STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS.

02:57:06.115 --> 02:57:07.850
TWENTY THIRTY YEARS FORWARD AND

02:57:07.917 --> 02:57:10.086
TO MAKE SURE THAT CAL FIRE IS

02:57:10.152 --> 02:57:11.687
EQUIPPED.

02:57:11.754 --> 02:57:14.924
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WITH --

02:57:14.991 --> 02:57:15.992
WITH.

02:57:16.058 --> 02:57:19.562
A STATE OF THE ART UPDATED --

02:57:19.628 --> 02:57:21.931
CAPABILITIES THAT INCLUDE

02:57:21.998 --> 02:57:23.332
ADDITIONAL ENGINES TO INCLUDE

02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:25.434
ADDITIONAL CREWS AS WELL AND SO

02:57:25.501 --> 02:57:27.536
WE THINK THAT GIVEN THE LIMITED

02:57:27.603 --> 02:57:28.871
RESOURCES.

02:57:28.938 --> 02:57:30.639
THAT THE PACKAGE THAT YOU HAVE

02:57:30.706 --> 02:57:33.242
BEFORE YOU IS THE MOST --

02:57:33.309 --> 02:57:34.443
STRATEGIC.

02:57:34.510 --> 02:57:36.145
ASSET ALLOCATION SO TO SPEAK

02:57:36.212 --> 02:57:37.713
BETWEEN AVIATION RESOURCES

02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:39.348
BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY BETWEEN

02:57:39.415 --> 02:57:41.083
ENGINES --

02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:45.287
TO PUT THE STATE IN A FORWARD --

02:57:45.354 --> 02:57:46.555
IN THE MEANTIME.

02:57:46.622 --> 02:57:48.624
CAL FIRE WILL BE DOING THIS LONG

02:57:48.691 --> 02:57:50.226
TERM STRATEGIC PLAN LOOK HIM

02:57:50.292 --> 02:57:51.560
WILL BE COMING BACK IN AND

02:57:51.627 --> 02:57:53.329
TALKING ABOUT THOSE ADDITIONAL

02:57:53.396 --> 02:57:54.463
RESOURCES.

02:57:54.530 --> 02:57:56.198
I'D ALSO SAY THAT.

02:57:56.265 --> 02:57:58.901
AS THE MET MADAM CHAIR MENTIONED

02:57:58.968 --> 02:58:00.269
IN THE BEGINNING.

02:58:00.336 --> 02:58:02.038
OF NEXT WEEK YOU'LL BE THERE IN

02:58:02.104 --> 02:58:04.306
THE COMING WEEK SHOULD BE TALK

02:58:04.373 --> 02:58:06.375
ABOUT BUDGET RESILIENCY --

02:58:06.442 --> 02:58:08.477
PART OF IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

02:58:08.544 --> 02:58:10.079
STAND IN THIS IS PART OF A

02:58:10.146 --> 02:58:11.814
LARGER PACKAGE OF THE BUDGET.

02:58:11.881 --> 02:58:13.416
AND AS PART OF THE LARGER --

02:58:13.482 --> 02:58:16.118
BUDGET ARCHITECTURE OF THE

02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:17.153
BUDGET -- OF

02:58:17.219 --> 02:58:20.056
THE ADMINISTRATION IS SENSITIVE

02:58:20.122 --> 02:58:21.524
TO MAKING SURE THAT WERE --

02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:23.692
FISCALLY PRUDENT IN TERMS OF ON

02:58:23.759 --> 02:58:25.327
GOING GENERAL FUND.

02:58:25.394 --> 02:58:27.063
AND SO -- WE

02:58:27.129 --> 02:58:29.498
BELIEVE THAT THIS PACKAGE NON

02:58:29.565 --> 02:58:32.368
GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH

02:58:32.435 --> 02:58:33.736
A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

02:58:33.803 --> 02:58:35.471
IN TERMS OF OF DEALING WITH

02:58:35.538 --> 02:58:37.273
THESE RISKS BUT WE WANT TO BE

02:58:37.339 --> 02:58:41.077
SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT --

02:58:41.143 --> 02:58:43.813
OF THE ONE OF A KIND OF CORE

02:58:43.879 --> 02:58:46.148
PRINCIPLES OF BUDGET RESILIENCY

02:58:46.215 --> 02:58:47.750
IS IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW --

02:58:47.817 --> 02:58:49.118
HAVE ONGOING GENERAL FUND

02:58:49.185 --> 02:58:50.853
RESEARCH IS THAT WHEN THE WHEN

02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:53.022
THERE'S A SHORTFALL WE JUST TAKE

02:58:53.089 --> 02:58:53.989
IT ALL BACK.

02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:54.890
SO WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS

02:58:54.957 --> 02:58:57.259
THESE THIRTEEN ENGINES.

02:58:57.326 --> 02:58:58.828
CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED IN THE

02:58:58.894 --> 02:59:00.496
LONG TERM --

02:59:00.563 --> 02:59:02.531
BECAUSE THERE'S TO STRATEGICALLY

02:59:02.598 --> 02:59:04.333
IMPORTANT --

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:07.103
AND I HAVE A BUDGET THAT IS ABLE

02:59:07.169 --> 02:59:08.504
TO MAKE THESE COMMITMENTS ON AN

02:59:08.571 --> 02:59:10.005
ONGOING BASIS SO WILL WILL

02:59:10.072 --> 02:59:10.873
CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE

02:59:10.940 --> 02:59:12.608
DISCUSSIONS BUT THAT'S KIND OF

02:59:12.675 --> 02:59:14.910
HOW WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IT IN

02:59:14.977 --> 02:59:16.579

02:59:25.521 --> 02:59:26.255
FIFTH.

02:59:26.322 --> 02:59:27.756
A YEAH BEEN SPECTACULAR TO BE

02:59:27.823 --> 02:59:28.958
ABLE TO WORK WITH IN REGARDS TO

02:59:29.024 --> 02:59:30.493
THE FIRES THATWE'VE HAD.

02:59:30.559 --> 02:59:32.795
A KEY THE BUZZER --

02:59:32.862 --> 02:59:35.531
IN THE PRIOR TO HER JERRY CROW

02:59:35.598 --> 02:59:37.032
FOOT -- WAS

02:59:37.099 --> 02:59:39.535
NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING --

02:59:39.602 --> 02:59:40.903

02:59:40.970 --> 02:59:43.072
WORDS AS BEING CRITICAL BUT

02:59:43.139 --> 02:59:44.773
SINCE.

02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:46.108
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN THE AREA

02:59:46.175 --> 02:59:48.644
THAT I REPRESENT NEARLY EIGHT

02:59:48.711 --> 02:59:50.746
THOUSAND HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST.

02:59:50.813 --> 02:59:51.814

02:59:51.881 --> 02:59:53.482

02:59:55.651 --> 02:59:56.719
OUR COMMUNITY SAY.

02:59:56.785 --> 03:00:00.156
SO WHAT I WILL SAY IS INVESTING

03:00:00.222 --> 03:00:01.724
SIXTY MILLION PER YEAR TO BE

03:00:01.790 --> 03:00:03.592

FIRE ENGINES.

03:00:06.262 --> 03:00:07.663
IS A LOT LESS THAN HAVING IS

03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:09.999
BEING TWELVE BILLION PER YEAR

03:00:10.065 --> 03:00:11.600
UNINSURED LOSSES.

03:00:11.667 --> 03:00:13.169
THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET THAT'S

03:00:13.235 --> 03:00:14.136

ANALOG MICROWAVE NETWORK THAT

MUST BE UPGRADED TO A DIGITAL

03:12:28.036 --> 03:12:29.437
NETWORKS SO THAT ALTERNATE

03:12:29.504 --> 03:12:31.006

DAMAGED EVACUATED OR OVERWHELMED

03:12:37.812 --> 03:12:39.681
CURRENTLY A DISPATCH CENTER IS --

03:12:39.748 --> 03:12:41.149
GENERALLY LEADING TO BE A SINGLE

03:12:41.216 --> 03:12:45.420
CONNECTION THAT TYPICALLY NOT

03:12:45.487 --> 03:12:46.922
HARDENED AND CANNOT SURVIVE A

03:12:46.988 --> 03:12:48.156
DISASTER WHEN THE DISASTER

03:12:48.223 --> 03:12:49.257
OCCURS THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE

03:12:49.324 --> 03:12:50.892

TO ONLY THE SINGLE ALTERNATE

03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:13.581
DISPATCH CENTER WHEN BOTH

03:13:13.648 --> 03:13:14.883
DISPATCH CENTERS NEED TO BE

03:13:14.950 --> 03:13:17.118
EVACUATED. NINE ONE ONE CALLS

03:13:17.185 --> 03:13:18.987
AGAIN CAN BE --

03:13:19.054 --> 03:13:21.022
CANNOT BE RE ROUTED --

03:13:21.089 --> 03:13:22.590
UNLESS ALTERNATE CIRCUITS ARE

03:13:22.657 --> 03:13:24.592
MANUALLY RE ROUTED WHICH IS A

03:13:24.659 --> 03:13:28.396
PROCESS THAT CAN TAKE TWELVE TO

03:13:28.463 --> 03:13:29.497

INTEROPERABLE AND CAN

03:16:32.447 --> 03:16:34.916

MENTIONED THAT PREVIOUSLY --

03:17:22.397 --> 03:17:24.465
THE STATE IS SLATED TO TO

GRANT SAID THAT CAN GO TO STATE

03:17:31.606 --> 03:17:33.107
AGENCIES AS WELL AS LOCAL SO

03:17:33.174 --> 03:17:34.309
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT --

03:17:34.375 --> 03:17:36.077
QUITE A BIT OF FINDING ON THIS

03:17:36.144 --> 03:17:37.078
WOULD PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

03:17:37.145 --> 03:17:39.013
FEDERAL FUNDS A THORNY --

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:40.181
FOR YES WOULD MINISTRIES GRANTS

03:17:40.248 --> 03:17:43.084
BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY LEGISLATURE

03:17:43.151 --> 03:17:44.552
MAY WANNA KEEP IN MIND --

03:17:44.619 --> 03:17:46.421
THERE'S ALSO DOCUMENTATION OF

03:17:46.487 --> 03:17:48.089
TWENTY MILLION FOR CDA ANOTHER

03:17:48.156 --> 03:17:48.957
SIXTEEN MILLION THAT SCHEDULE

03:17:49.023 --> 03:17:50.291
FOR THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING

03:17:50.358 --> 03:17:51.826
SYSTEM AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE

03:17:51.893 --> 03:17:53.228
THAT'S BEEN AN ONGOING THING THE

03:17:53.294 --> 03:17:56.030
STATE IS INVESTED IN ITS --

03:17:56.097 --> 03:17:56.831
EARTHQUAKE REALLY WAITING SYSTEM

03:17:56.898 --> 03:17:57.765
IN THIS WOULD COME OUT FINISHED

03:17:57.832 --> 03:17:58.800
BASICALLY THE BUILD OUT BUT NOT

03:17:58.866 --> 03:18:01.069
DEAL WITH THE ON GOING --

03:18:01.135 --> 03:18:02.170
FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM.

03:18:02.237 --> 03:18:04.505
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN ALL

03:18:04.572 --> 03:18:06.574
QUICKLY GO OVER JUST A COUPLE OF

03:18:06.641 --> 03:18:08.109
VERY HIGH LEVEL PRELIMINARY

03:18:08.176 --> 03:18:10.311
COMMENTS WE HAVE WE'RE STILL

03:18:10.378 --> 03:18:11.446
ANALYZING ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS.

03:18:11.512 --> 03:18:12.780
BUT BUT THESE ARE JUST A FEW

03:18:12.847 --> 03:18:14.382
THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND --

03:18:14.449 --> 03:18:15.783
SO ONE COMMENT IS JUST THAT

03:18:15.850 --> 03:18:17.785
SOMEBODY'S PROPOSAL'S LACK

03:18:17.852 --> 03:18:19.187
DETAIL AT THIS POINT --

03:18:19.254 --> 03:18:20.555
I CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:18:20.622 --> 03:18:22.390
ANYONE COMING AND BUT BUT KNOW

03:18:22.457 --> 03:18:23.224
THAT THERE ARE FEW PROPOSALS

03:18:23.291 --> 03:18:23.958
THAT DON'T --

03:18:24.025 --> 03:18:25.093
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

03:18:25.159 --> 03:18:26.628
DOCUMENTATION BEHIND THEM YET ON

03:18:26.694 --> 03:18:28.630
THE PUBLIC EDUCATION ONE IS IS

03:18:28.696 --> 03:18:29.664
ONE I KNOW YOU'LL BE CONSIDERING

03:18:29.731 --> 03:18:30.898
THAT SOON --

03:18:30.965 --> 03:18:32.367
THE NINE ONE ONE PROPOSAL AN

03:18:32.433 --> 03:18:33.101
EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING THERE'S

03:18:33.167 --> 03:18:34.168
DOES YOUR SORT OF CONTINUATION

03:18:34.235 --> 03:18:35.470
FROM LAST YEAR BUT THERE'S NOT A

03:18:35.536 --> 03:18:36.971
LOT OF INFORMATION ON THIS

03:18:37.038 --> 03:18:38.072
YEAR'S PIECE --

03:18:38.139 --> 03:18:38.973
SO THOSE ARE SOME EXAMPLES THE

03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:40.441
LEGISLATURE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

03:18:40.508 --> 03:18:40.975
IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THE

03:18:41.042 --> 03:18:42.543
INFORMATION THAT THE INFORMATION

03:18:42.610 --> 03:18:44.178
THAT THEY RECEIVE --

03:18:44.245 --> 03:18:45.647
IS SUFFICIENT --

03:18:45.713 --> 03:18:46.247
TO MAKE TO HELP TO MAKE THOSE

03:18:46.314 --> 03:18:47.548
DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO FIND

03:18:47.615 --> 03:18:49.917
THESE PROGRAMS WHETHER MORE OR

03:18:49.984 --> 03:18:53.921
LESS THAN --

03:18:53.988 --> 03:18:54.522
THAN THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE

03:18:54.589 --> 03:18:56.758
SAME ABOUT THE MYSTERY IT'S

03:18:56.824 --> 03:18:57.959
ABOUT FUNDS SOURCE --

03:18:58.026 --> 03:18:58.960
SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS REALLY

03:18:59.027 --> 03:19:00.528
RAISE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT FUND

03:19:00.595 --> 03:19:01.763
SOURCE THE MINISTRATION MAKES

03:19:01.829 --> 03:19:02.864
VARIOUS CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO

03:19:02.930 --> 03:19:03.464
FIND.

03:19:03.531 --> 03:19:05.166
ON SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR

03:19:05.233 --> 03:19:06.567
EXAMPLE THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM

03:19:06.634 --> 03:19:07.435
WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

03:19:07.502 --> 03:19:08.903
THAT -- YOU

03:19:08.970 --> 03:19:10.204
KNOW THERE'S CURRENTLY A FEW

03:19:10.271 --> 03:19:12.373
STRUCTURE THAT'S IN PLACE AND

03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:14.142
YOU DECISIONS ABOUT.

03:19:14.208 --> 03:19:15.910
DO YOU WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT

03:19:15.977 --> 03:19:16.544
HOW DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT

03:19:16.611 --> 03:19:18.112
STRUCTURE ON TO SUPPORT BOTH THE

03:19:18.179 --> 03:19:19.714
BUILD OUT OF NEXT GEN AS WELL AS

03:19:19.781 --> 03:19:21.049
JUST THE CONTINUATION OF

03:19:21.115 --> 03:19:22.684
SUPPORTING OUR NINE ONE SYSTEM --

03:19:22.750 --> 03:19:23.918
HOW MUCH RELY ON THE GENERAL

03:19:23.985 --> 03:19:25.286
FUND IS A LOAN OR --

03:19:25.353 --> 03:19:27.655
ACTUALLY JUST AS A CONTRIBUTION

03:19:27.722 --> 03:19:30.124
VERSES THOSE THOSE --

03:19:30.191 --> 03:19:33.194
FOR OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS --

03:19:33.261 --> 03:19:34.095
SIMILAR ISSUES REGARDING

03:19:34.162 --> 03:19:35.997
EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING --

03:19:36.064 --> 03:19:37.031
WE'VE FUNDED SOME GENERAL WE'VE

03:19:37.098 --> 03:19:38.766
SPENT GENERAL FUND TO BUILD OUT

03:19:38.833 --> 03:19:39.734
THE SYSTEM --

03:19:39.801 --> 03:19:41.169
LAST YEAR THERE IS A REPORT THAT

03:19:41.235 --> 03:19:42.804
RAISE SOME OPTIONS OF POTENTIAL

03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:44.439
CHARGES THAT COULD BE IN PLACE

03:19:44.505 --> 03:19:45.206
TO FUNDS THAT SYSTEM IN ON A

03:19:45.273 --> 03:19:46.841
ONGOING BASIS BUT NO DECISIONS

03:19:46.908 --> 03:19:47.775
HAVE BEEN MADE.

03:19:47.842 --> 03:19:48.242
SO THAT SOMETHING THE

03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:49.143
LEGISLATURE'S --

03:19:49.210 --> 03:19:50.745
LIKELY TO HAVE TO CHECK TO TO

03:19:50.812 --> 03:19:51.813
TACKLE -- IN

03:19:51.879 --> 03:19:53.281
THE COMING YEAR HOW WE THINK

03:19:53.348 --> 03:19:54.449
ABOUT WHAT'S THE BEST SOURCE OF

03:19:54.515 --> 03:19:55.249
FUNDING --

03:19:55.316 --> 03:19:56.884
SO THAT WE HAVE A GOOD

03:19:56.951 --> 03:19:59.387
EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING --

03:19:59.454 --> 03:20:00.822
TO AND THEN A FINAL --

03:20:00.888 --> 03:20:03.024
CONSIDERATION IS THAT --

03:20:03.091 --> 03:20:03.858
YOU SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS

03:20:03.925 --> 03:20:05.493
REYES CHOICES ABOUT THE TIMING

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:07.862
OF FUNDING ON NOTABLY AT AS THE

03:20:07.929 --> 03:20:09.263
COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER VERY

03:20:09.330 --> 03:20:10.598
SOON THERE SOME THESE PROPOSALS

03:20:10.665 --> 03:20:12.200
THAT ARE FUNDED --

03:20:12.266 --> 03:20:12.734
FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND

03:20:12.800 --> 03:20:13.501
CERTAINLY THERE'S AN URGENCY TO

03:20:13.568 --> 03:20:14.869
SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS --

03:20:14.936 --> 03:20:15.903
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO TRADE OFF

03:20:15.970 --> 03:20:18.473
THAT URGENCY VERSES ON JUST THAT

03:20:18.539 --> 03:20:21.008
THOSE PROPOSALS WILL GO THROUGH

03:20:21.075 --> 03:20:23.010
THE TYPICAL BUDGET PROCESS

03:20:23.077 --> 03:20:23.311
[inaudible]

03:20:23.378 --> 03:20:25.012
THANK YOU.

03:20:25.079 --> 03:20:25.580
QUESTIONS ON FROM COMMITTEE

MEMBERS. THIRTY NIELSEN FOLLOWED

03:20:31.552 --> 03:20:33.421
BY CENTER MORE LOT.

03:20:33.488 --> 03:20:34.989
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING

03:20:35.056 --> 03:20:37.592
SOME SPECIFICITY TO THE NINE ONE

03:20:37.658 --> 03:20:40.928
ONE HAD THAT INFORMATION BEENAVAILABLE TO ME YOU'VE.

03:20:40.995 --> 03:20:41.763
LAST YEAR THEN MAYBE THINGS

03:20:41.829 --> 03:20:43.164
COULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT --

03:20:43.231 --> 03:20:45.466
BUT THIS IS HELPFUL TO KNOW THAT

03:20:45.533 --> 03:20:47.034
WHAT IS A PLAN THERE IS A PLAN.

03:20:47.101 --> 03:20:49.570
A WHAT WE WILL ALSO NEED TO DO

03:20:49.637 --> 03:20:51.739
IS THOUGH ESTABLISHING SOME WHAT

03:20:51.806 --> 03:20:53.174
I WOULD CALL BENCH MARKS.

03:20:53.241 --> 03:20:55.810
IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

03:20:55.877 --> 03:20:58.212
NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM.

03:20:58.279 --> 03:20:59.947
I DON'T WANNA WAIT WAITING A

03:21:00.014 --> 03:21:02.417
FULL YEAR. TO SEE HOW THINGS

03:21:02.483 --> 03:21:04.552
WENT WE NEED TO BE ASSESSING AS

03:21:04.619 --> 03:21:05.920
WE GO ALONG IT'S GOING TO BE

03:21:05.987 --> 03:21:07.288
QUITE A COMMITMENT OF THE

03:21:07.355 --> 03:21:08.823
RESOURCE IS NOT AS MUCH AS SOME

03:21:08.890 --> 03:21:10.091
OF THESE TECH PROJECTS THAT

03:21:10.158 --> 03:21:11.626
WE'VE BEEN EMBARKING ON OVER THE

03:21:11.692 --> 03:21:13.294
YEARS BUT BUT WE WANT TO KEEP

03:21:13.361 --> 03:21:13.861
TRACK OF IT.

03:21:13.928 --> 03:21:14.862
BUT I WANTED TO THANK YOU VERY

03:21:14.929 --> 03:21:18.966
MUCH FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND NOW

03:21:19.033 --> 03:21:20.701
I'VE I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE

03:21:20.768 --> 03:21:21.903
THAN I DID BEFORE BECAUSE

03:21:21.969 --> 03:21:25.907
THERE'S SOME SPECIFICITY TO IT.

03:21:25.973 --> 03:21:28.142
SO THE MORE LAW.

03:21:28.209 --> 03:21:29.510
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON THE

03:21:29.577 --> 03:21:32.647
INOPERABLE INTEROPERABLE

SPEAKING --

03:21:33.714 --> 03:21:37.552
PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO SYSTEM --

03:21:37.618 --> 03:21:39.654
THE COUNTY OF ORANGE THAT EIGHT

03:21:39.720 --> 03:21:40.788
HUNDRED MEGAHERTZ SYSTEM.

03:21:40.855 --> 03:21:42.457
AND WE GOT EVERYTHING EVERYBODY

03:21:42.523 --> 03:21:44.425
COORDINATED INSIDE OUR EIGHT

03:21:44.492 --> 03:21:45.259
HUNDRED SQUARE MILES AND BILL TO

03:21:45.326 --> 03:21:46.928
THE TOWER ON CATALINA ISLAND SO

03:21:46.994 --> 03:21:49.130
WE HAD EVERYTHING TAKEN CARE OF

03:21:49.197 --> 03:21:51.265
BUT WE GET THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO

03:21:51.332 --> 03:21:53.434
SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS.

03:21:53.501 --> 03:21:55.837
WHY ARE WE WHY IS AHEAD IN THIS

03:21:55.903 --> 03:21:57.672
IN PLACE ALREADY WHY WE'RE WE'RE

03:21:57.738 --> 03:21:59.240
PUTTING? TEN SIXTY MILLION OVER

03:21:59.307 --> 03:22:00.274
FIVE YEARS BUT IT.

03:22:00.341 --> 03:22:01.776
IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE

03:22:01.843 --> 03:22:03.478
BEEN THERE SOONER SOME MAYBE OR

03:22:03.544 --> 03:22:04.712
SOME HISTORY THAT I'M NOT A

03:22:04.779 --> 03:22:10.852
FAMILIAR WITH.

03:22:10.918 --> 03:22:12.753
SO A FIRM MAYBE SOME OF THE

03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:14.255
TECHNICAL DETAILS --

03:22:14.322 --> 03:22:15.523
WOULD DEFER TO ADD DIRECTOR

03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:17.525
GULAR DUTY BUT I THINK IT IS

03:22:17.592 --> 03:22:19.694
THAT FAIR TO SAY THAT ALSO --

03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:21.395
THERE SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS IN THE

03:22:21.462 --> 03:22:23.231
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT RELY ON

03:22:23.297 --> 03:22:25.266
PUBLIC SAFETY RADIOS AND THERE

03:22:25.333 --> 03:22:27.235
HAS BEEN --

03:22:27.301 --> 03:22:29.537
INDIVIDUALIZED EFFORTS TO

03:22:29.604 --> 03:22:31.105
UPGRADE RADIO SYSTEMS --

03:22:31.172 --> 03:22:32.206
DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS AND

03:22:32.273 --> 03:22:34.909
REHABILITATION FOR HAS RECENTLY

03:22:34.976 --> 03:22:36.210
BEEN UPGRADING THEIR RADIO

03:22:36.277 --> 03:22:37.979
SYSTEM AND PARTS OF THOSE

03:22:38.045 --> 03:22:39.947
UPGRADES INCLUDE PIECES OF INTER

03:22:40.014 --> 03:22:42.850
OPERABILITY BUT I THINK THIS --

03:22:42.917 --> 03:22:44.585
STATEWIDE APPROACH HERE MANAGED

03:22:44.652 --> 03:22:46.621
BY -- YES IS

03:22:46.687 --> 03:22:49.657
REALLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THE

03:22:49.724 --> 03:22:51.392
BACKBONE AND ABILITY FOR ALL

03:22:51.459 --> 03:22:53.060
THESE RADIO NETWORKS --

03:22:53.127 --> 03:22:55.563
THAT ARE THE MOST UP TO DATE I

03:22:55.630 --> 03:22:56.464
THINK P. TWENTY FIVE CYNG

03:22:56.531 --> 03:22:58.099
COMPLIANT RADIO SYSTEMS TO BE

03:22:58.165 --> 03:23:00.735
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE COMMUNICATE --

03:23:00.801 --> 03:23:02.904
AT WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

03:23:02.970 --> 03:23:05.273
IN A DISASTER EVENTS AND

03:23:05.339 --> 03:23:06.874
EMERGENCY EVENTS WHERE YOU HAVE

03:23:06.941 --> 03:23:08.776
MULTIPLE --

03:23:08.843 --> 03:23:10.878
AGENCIES MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS

03:23:10.945 --> 03:23:12.780
RESPONDING ALL TO THE SAME

03:23:12.847 --> 03:23:14.048
INCIDENT TRYING TO COMMUNICATE.

03:23:14.115 --> 03:23:15.082
HOW WILL THIS BE A MATCHING

03:23:15.149 --> 03:23:17.184
PROGRAM WHERE ORANGE COUNTY IS

03:23:17.251 --> 03:23:19.854
ALREADY YET MAYBE ESTABLISH WHAT

03:23:19.921 --> 03:23:22.323
WOULD HAVE TO UPGRADE --

03:23:22.390 --> 03:23:23.858
I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD

03:23:23.925 --> 03:23:25.626
PROVIDE KIND OF THE BACKBONE AND

03:23:25.693 --> 03:23:28.062
ABILITY FOR LOCAL ENTITIES TO

03:23:28.129 --> 03:23:31.499
COMMUNICATE ON THE INTEROPERABLE

03:23:31.566 --> 03:23:36.170
NETWORK BUT I BELIEVE IT IS A

03:23:36.237 --> 03:23:36.771
FEE FOR SERVICE TYPE APPROACH

03:23:36.837 --> 03:23:40.174
BUT THE BY --

03:23:40.241 --> 03:23:41.742
DIRECTOR GILLARD WHICH IF WE

03:23:41.809 --> 03:23:44.445
HAVE THAT INFORMATION.

03:23:44.512 --> 03:23:44.912
THANK YOU.

03:23:44.979 --> 03:23:46.047
SIR I DON'T HAVE THAT

03:23:46.113 --> 03:23:46.781
INFORMATION RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO

03:23:46.847 --> 03:23:47.448
GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT TO FIND

03:23:47.515 --> 03:23:48.783
OUT EXACTLY.

03:23:48.849 --> 03:23:50.451
HOW THAT'S GONNA LINCOLN BUT THE

03:23:50.518 --> 03:23:52.153
IDEA BEHIND THE UPGRADE OF THE

03:23:52.219 --> 03:23:53.054
SYSTEM?

03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:54.221
WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOCAL

03:23:54.288 --> 03:23:55.523
GOVERNMENTS WITH THE SPIRIT

03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:57.224
SYSTEMS AS WELL THIS ALSO WILL

03:23:57.291 --> 03:23:59.226
ALLOW BETTER INNER ABA BILLION

03:23:59.293 --> 03:24:00.928
PLUGIN ON THOSE ON THOSE SYSTEMS

03:24:00.995 --> 03:24:02.863
SO -- BUT I

03:24:02.930 --> 03:24:04.131
I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON WASTE

03:24:04.198 --> 03:24:06.400
MORE SPECIFICS ON THAT GREAT THE

03:24:06.467 --> 03:24:07.768
ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPT

03:24:07.835 --> 03:24:11.672
DEPARTMENT HAS A WEBSITE OF OF

03:24:11.739 --> 03:24:13.107
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IT'S STILL TO

03:24:13.174 --> 03:24:14.442
OUT SO IT MIGHT BE.

03:24:14.508 --> 03:24:16.344
HELPFUL ON THE SIXTY MILLION

03:24:16.410 --> 03:24:17.244
FROM THE GENERAL FUND.

03:24:17.311 --> 03:24:21.582
GOING TO THE NEXT GEN --

03:24:21.649 --> 03:24:22.183
NINE ONE ONE WITH TEN MILLION

03:24:22.249 --> 03:24:23.284
THIS YEAR --

03:24:23.351 --> 03:24:24.485
I LIKE YOUR TERM OF

03:24:24.552 --> 03:24:25.987
RESTRUCTURING THE FEE MATCHES

03:24:26.053 --> 03:24:28.055
AND INTERESTING TAKE ON IT WHICH

03:24:28.122 --> 03:24:29.624
IS SORT OF IN MY THOUGHT ALL

03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:31.959
ALONG THAT I I TRY TO WORK WITH

03:24:32.026 --> 03:24:34.462
REGINALD SALVADOR LAST YEAR AND

03:24:34.528 --> 03:24:36.197
I BUILT A PRETTY GOOD FILE OF

03:24:36.263 --> 03:24:36.664
TRYING TO COMMUNICATE.

03:24:36.731 --> 03:24:41.068
WITH DUE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS

03:24:41.135 --> 03:24:42.837
GOING ON WITH THE NINE ONE ONE

03:24:42.903 --> 03:24:44.138
SYSTEM AND SO I APPRECIATE.

03:24:44.205 --> 03:24:45.172
WHAT ELLIE --

03:24:45.239 --> 03:24:47.308
SAYS SOME SOME REQUEST BLACK

03:24:47.375 --> 03:24:49.176
DETAIL AND I'M STILL GETTING A

03:24:49.243 --> 03:24:50.711
LACK OF A DETAIL THAT TRYING TO

03:24:50.778 --> 03:24:52.046
FIGURE OUT.

03:24:52.113 --> 03:24:53.414
WHAT'S THE CAPITAL

03:24:53.481 --> 03:24:55.983
INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT WILL IT COST

03:24:56.050 --> 03:24:58.719
OUR WE IMPLEMENTING COMPARED TO

03:24:58.786 --> 03:25:00.221
CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES WE'VE GOT.

03:25:00.287 --> 03:25:01.722
THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY FOR

03:25:01.789 --> 03:25:04.025
WORKING ON FIVE G. HOW WE ARE

03:25:04.091 --> 03:25:06.360
WAS AT ALL FITTING IN WHAT'S THE

03:25:06.427 --> 03:25:08.929
OVERALL GAME PLAN AND AND AND

03:25:08.996 --> 03:25:09.630
THEN.

03:25:09.697 --> 03:25:11.132
YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SYSTEMIC

03:25:11.198 --> 03:25:12.600
CHANGES.

03:25:12.667 --> 03:25:14.602
PEOPLE TO WEAR WATCHES ANYMORE

03:25:14.669 --> 03:25:15.469
BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR

03:25:15.536 --> 03:25:16.837
CELL PHONES.

03:25:16.904 --> 03:25:21.776
RIGHT MOVIES THE KIDS ARE MORE

03:25:21.842 --> 03:25:23.944
WATCHES IN LEARNING.

03:25:24.011 --> 03:25:24.945
SO SO YOU KNEW THAT LAND LINES

03:25:25.012 --> 03:25:27.314
WERE DECREASING FOR A LONG TIME

03:25:27.381 --> 03:25:28.883
AND THAT SELLS.

03:25:28.949 --> 03:25:30.418
CELLPHONES EXPANDING AND AND SO

03:25:30.484 --> 03:25:31.886
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

03:25:31.952 --> 03:25:33.087
YOU KNOW SEEMS LIKE IT'S

03:25:33.154 --> 03:25:35.189
LANGUAGE WORK CAN BE DONE.

03:25:35.256 --> 03:25:36.791
YEARS AGO AND I AGAIN IS JUST

03:25:36.857 --> 03:25:37.358
ONE OF THOSE MAYBE THERE'S A

03:25:37.425 --> 03:25:39.760
HISTORY TO IT.

03:25:39.827 --> 03:25:40.361
MAYBE YOU COULD FILL ME IN ON

03:25:40.428 --> 03:25:42.630
THAT.

03:25:42.697 --> 03:25:45.366
IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN OUTDATED

03:25:45.433 --> 03:25:47.134
LONG OVERDUE --

03:25:47.201 --> 03:25:49.036
RESTRUCTURING OF THE FEE IT'S

03:25:49.103 --> 03:25:51.439
BASED ON INTRASTATE VOICE CALLS

03:25:51.505 --> 03:25:52.807
WHICH AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE AND

03:25:52.873 --> 03:25:54.341
ALLUDED --

03:25:54.408 --> 03:25:54.975
TO IS A DYING --

03:25:55.042 --> 03:25:56.477
MODE OF COMMUNICATION AND AS

03:25:56.544 --> 03:25:58.746
PEOPLE MAKE LESS CALLS --

03:25:58.813 --> 03:26:00.481
THERE'S LESS REVENUE AND THAT'S

03:26:00.548 --> 03:26:03.050
KIND OF JUST THE MOST I GUESS

03:26:03.117 --> 03:26:06.087
SIMPLISTIC OVERVIEW OF WHY THE

03:26:06.153 --> 03:26:08.122
REVENUE HAS STEADILY DECLINED

03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:09.890
ITS DECLINE THOUGH TO A POINT

03:26:09.957 --> 03:26:13.360
WHERE IT CAN'T SUSTAIN LEGACY

03:26:13.427 --> 03:26:14.929
NINE ONE ONE EXPENDITURES AND

03:26:14.995 --> 03:26:16.697
EVEN IF WE WEREN'T.

03:26:16.764 --> 03:26:18.833
PROPOSING TO FURTHER --

03:26:18.899 --> 03:26:21.535
BUILD OUT A NEXT GENERATION NINE

03:26:21.602 --> 03:26:22.603
ONE ONE SYSTEM AN UPGRADE THOSE

03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:23.704
SERVICES --

03:26:23.771 --> 03:26:25.306
THERE WOULD BE PROBLEMS AND WE

03:26:25.372 --> 03:26:27.208
WOULD YOU KNOW BE FACING A A

03:26:27.274 --> 03:26:30.277
SIMILAR PROPOSAL TO RESTRUCTURE

03:26:30.344 --> 03:26:32.546
THE FEE IN A WAY THAT MATCHES --

03:26:32.613 --> 03:26:35.483
CURRENT MODES OF COMMUNICATION

03:26:35.549 --> 03:26:36.951
WOULD YOU GET THERE LET ME HELP

03:26:37.017 --> 03:26:40.254
YOU GIVE ME SPREADSHEETS AND

03:26:40.321 --> 03:26:41.489
PROJECTIONS AND FORECASTS OF

03:26:41.555 --> 03:26:43.257
WHERE YOU'RE GOING SO.

03:26:43.324 --> 03:26:44.158
MAYBE IN THE DAY IT IS IN THE

03:26:44.225 --> 03:26:45.226
TAX INCREASE WHICH IS BECAUSE

03:26:45.292 --> 03:26:49.330
IT'S REQUIRING A TWO THIRDS VOTE.

03:26:49.396 --> 03:26:51.232
IT INFERS THAT IT'S MORE OF A

03:26:51.298 --> 03:26:53.033
TAX AND FEES I'D LIKE. TO TO WE

03:26:53.100 --> 03:26:54.668
CAN DO TO MAKE IT LEAR AND

03:26:54.735 --> 03:26:55.136
UNDERSTANDABLE TO OUR

03:26:55.202 --> 03:26:56.203
CONSTITUENTS --

03:26:56.270 --> 03:26:58.539
WE BELIEVE IT REQUIRES A TWO

03:26:58.606 --> 03:27:00.241
THIRDS VOTE I THINK THAT THERE

03:27:00.307 --> 03:27:00.641
ARE --

03:27:00.708 --> 03:27:03.244
CERTAINLY DIRECT BENEFITS TO

03:27:03.310 --> 03:27:04.845
EVERY -- OF

03:27:04.912 --> 03:27:07.214
THE AT ALL OF THE SURCHARGE

03:27:07.281 --> 03:27:09.817
PAYERS CLEARLY RECEIVE A DIRECT

03:27:09.884 --> 03:27:12.319
BENEFIT FROM THEIR PAYMENT INTO

03:27:12.386 --> 03:27:14.455
THE SYSTEM HOWEVER THERE ARE

03:27:14.522 --> 03:27:15.890
NUANCES WITH --

03:27:15.956 --> 03:27:18.492
VISITORS FROM OUT OF STATE WHO

03:27:18.559 --> 03:27:19.827
FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM

03:27:19.894 --> 03:27:21.762
THE SYSTEM BUT NOT NECESSARILY

03:27:21.829 --> 03:27:23.497
PAIN INTO CALIFORNIANS NINE ONE

03:27:23.564 --> 03:27:25.800
ONE SYSTEM SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT.

03:27:25.866 --> 03:27:27.935
IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE IS PRUDENT

03:27:28.002 --> 03:27:30.938
ON IT -- THE

03:27:31.005 --> 03:27:33.340
LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT A SUFFICES

03:27:33.407 --> 03:27:37.745
TO GIVE YOU COMFORT IT'S A BIT

03:27:37.812 --> 03:27:40.347
COMPLICATED BUT ALSO ON A KIND

03:27:40.414 --> 03:27:42.583
OF SURFACE LEVEL AND LOOKING AT

03:27:42.650 --> 03:27:44.685
AROUND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO

03:27:44.752 --> 03:27:45.286
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

03:27:45.352 --> 03:27:46.620
IN TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE

03:27:46.687 --> 03:27:47.855
NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

03:27:47.922 --> 03:27:50.191
AS YOU MAINTAIN THE LEGACY NINE

03:27:50.257 --> 03:27:52.226
ONE ONE SYSTEM AND UPGRADE TO

03:27:52.293 --> 03:27:54.461
THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE

03:27:54.528 --> 03:27:57.097
SYSTEM AND THE TRAILER BILL

03:27:57.164 --> 03:27:58.666
LANGUAGE THAT WAS INTRODUCED

03:27:58.732 --> 03:28:00.968
LAST YEAR A PROVIDED A PROCESS

03:28:01.035 --> 03:28:02.770
WHEREBY THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

03:28:02.837 --> 03:28:04.305
SERVICES WOULD COLLECT.

03:28:04.371 --> 03:28:06.907
INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOTAL

03:28:06.974 --> 03:28:08.509
NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES AND

03:28:08.576 --> 03:28:10.878
SUBSCRIBERS EACH YEAR AND WOULD

03:28:10.945 --> 03:28:12.680
THEN COMPARE THAT TO THE TOTAL

03:28:12.746 --> 03:28:13.981
COST OF THE PROGRAM FOR THAT

03:28:14.048 --> 03:28:15.516
YEAR WHICH ARE APPROVED THROUGH

03:28:15.583 --> 03:28:16.717
THE BUDGET.

03:28:16.784 --> 03:28:18.319
AND THEN YOU KNOW IS TO

03:28:18.385 --> 03:28:19.954
BASICALLY THAT SIMPLE MATH THAT

03:28:20.020 --> 03:28:23.557
SETS THE FEE FOR THAT CALENDAR

03:28:23.624 --> 03:28:24.692
YEAR AND WE'VE.

03:28:24.758 --> 03:28:26.760
TRIED TO UTILIZE THE TEN MILLION

03:28:26.827 --> 03:28:28.062
DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT

03:28:28.128 --> 03:28:29.396
IS PROPOSED IN THE FIFTEEN

03:28:29.463 --> 03:28:30.264
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET

03:28:30.331 --> 03:28:33.067
YEAR THAT'S PROPOSED TO ALSO --

03:28:33.133 --> 03:28:34.568
TRY TO MITIGATE SOME OF THESE

03:28:34.635 --> 03:28:37.204
LIMITED TERM BUILD OUT COSTS.

03:28:37.271 --> 03:28:39.406
DIDN'T MITIGATE THE IMPACT THAT

03:28:39.473 --> 03:28:41.275
THEY WOULD HAVE ON KIND OF A YOU

03:28:41.342 --> 03:28:42.643
KNOW QUITE A LOT QUOTE ON QUOTE

03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:45.713
SPIKE IN THE FEE THAT'S CHARGED

03:28:45.779 --> 03:28:47.147
AND TRIED --

03:28:47.214 --> 03:28:48.249
TO COMES MOVE THAT OUT SO THAT

03:28:48.315 --> 03:28:49.884
YOU'RE NOT SEEN A LARGE

03:28:49.950 --> 03:28:51.385
FLUCTUATION --

03:28:51.452 --> 03:28:53.954
OF THE MONTHLY FEE --

03:28:54.021 --> 03:28:55.923
YOU -- YEAR

03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:59.526
OVER YEAR SO RELATIVELY FLAT

03:28:59.593 --> 03:29:01.195
DURING THE BUILD OUT.

03:29:01.262 --> 03:29:02.162
IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

03:29:02.229 --> 03:29:03.130
CELL PHONE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY

03:29:03.197 --> 03:29:05.132
PAYING A FEE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY
