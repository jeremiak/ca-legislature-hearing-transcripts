PRIMARY REASON THAT IT'S

00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:39.785 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE CALIFORNIA

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:43.489 region:rollup2
DO THIS WE HAVE. OUTLINED IN

LABOR CODE SECTION FIVE ELEVEN

00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:46.392 region:rollup2
AND ALTERNATIVE WORK WEEK

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:47.693 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE PROCESS THAT.

00:23:46.392 --> 00:23:50.362 region:rollup2
VERY CLEARLY ALREADY ALLOWS

00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:52.097 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO ASK WORKERS IF THEY

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:53.265 region:rollup2
WANT TO GO TO SAY FOR TENS AND

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:54.900 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PROCESS THERE THAT

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:56.502 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THEM TO DO THIS. THROUGH

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.070 region:rollup2
ELECTION TWO THIRDS OF WORKERS

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:59.204 region:rollup2
HAVE TO AGREE THERE'S CLEAR

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.439 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IN THE RAGS THAT

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:01.607 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.342 region:rollup2
INTIMIDATING OR THREATENING

00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:04.843 region:rollup2
WORKERS THAT. MAKE SURE IT'S A

00:24:03.342 --> 00:24:06.478 region:rollup2
FAIR PROCESS THAT WORKERS.

IN AND WAY AND WE CAN GET A ON

00:24:09.415 --> 00:24:12.418 region:rollup2
THE ACCU WILL ABSORB AND ACTUAL

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:14.153 region:rollup2
HONEST READ ON WHETHER OR NOT

00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:15.220 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES WANT TO GO TO

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:16.855 region:rollup2
SAY FOR TENS.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.757 region:rollup2
SO THE PROCESS EXISTS BUT I

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:20.292 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S BEEN ABOUT THIRTY

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:21.160 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND OF THESE

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:23.195 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS SINCE THE LAW'S BEEN

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.096 region:rollup2
IN PLACE. ARM AND YOU WE THINK

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:25.264 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS GENERALLY WORKS

00:24:24.096 --> 00:24:26.732 region:rollup2
PRETTY WELL THERE'S REALLY NO

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:27.1000 region:rollup2
REASON TO WEAKEN IT WHICH. IS

00:24:26.732 --> 00:24:29.234 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT

00:24:27.1000 --> 00:24:30.469 region:rollup2
KIND OF TAKES A LOOK AT THE

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:32.237 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE WORK WEEK SCHEDULE

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:33.305 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND. TAKES OUT

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:34.873 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN IT THAT WORKS FOR

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:36.742 region:rollup2
WORKERS SO THAT TWO THIRDS

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:38.444 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT IS GONE. INDIVIDUAL

00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:40.245 region:rollup2
WORKERS CAN BE PRESSURED INTO

00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:41.814 region:rollup2
MAKING THIS DECISION THERE THERE

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:43.682 region:rollup2
IS SOME LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:45.017 region:rollup2
THAT SEEKS TO. PROHIBIT

00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:46.952 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS FROM THREATENING OR

00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:48.253 region:rollup2
INTIMIDATING WORKERS BUT THERE'S

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:50.189 region:rollup2
REALLY NO WAY TO ENFORCE THEM

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:50.756 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT THERE AREN'T

00:24:50.189 --> 00:24:51.757 region:rollup2
ANY STANDARDS THAT PROHIBITS

00:24:50.756 --> 00:24:52.725 region:rollup2
SAY.

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:54.426 region:rollup2
THESE MEETINGS FROM HAPPENING

00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:56.161 region:rollup2
ONE ON ONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:57.629 region:rollup2
IN REALITY MEANS THAT WORKERS

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.198 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PRESSURED INTO AGREEING

00:24:57.629 --> 00:25:00.933 region:rollup2
TO THINGS LIKE THIS ON MORE THIS

00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:02.468 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY BE IN PRACTICE.

00:25:00.933 --> 00:25:03.669 region:rollup2
AND FURTHER MORE THE AT THE FACT

00:25:02.468 --> 00:25:05.204 region:rollup2
THAT IT TARGETS NOVEMBER

00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:06.605 region:rollup2
DECEMBER AND JANUARY. SEEM

00:25:05.204 --> 00:25:08.073 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY PUNITIVE TO US GIVEN

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:10.242 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS WHEN WORKERS COSTS

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:11.276 region:rollup2
TEND TO RISE GIVEN THAT THIS IS

00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:12.778 region:rollup2
WHEN THE HOLIDAYS HAPPEN THIS IS

00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:14.680 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU NEED TO TRAVEL THIS IS

00:25:12.778 --> 00:25:16.248 region:rollup2
WHEN FAMILIES COMING INTO TOWN.

IN WORKERS IF ANYTHING NEED

00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:19.418 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY RATHER THAN SEEING

THEIR OVERTIME PROTECTIONS

00:25:19.418 --> 00:25:23.055 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED UNDER THE LAW AND SO

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.689 region:rollup2
THESE A VARIETY OF OTHER REASONS

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:25.991 region:rollup2

IN OPPOSITION.

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.414 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE WILL TURN TO THE

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:28.854 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HALF A

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:29.922 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:31.690 region:rollup2
SOME MEMBERS ARE ANY GONZALEZ

00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:33.459 region:rollup2
FLETCHER. AYE I'M SORRY I'M

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.860 region:rollup2
SORRY READ THE BILL YOU KNOW I'M

00:26:33.459 --> 00:26:36.161 region:rollup2
INTERESTED I LEARNED A LOT FROM

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.429 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS SONY THINKS BECAUSE

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:38.097 region:rollup2
COURSE COMING FROM ORGANIZED

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.932 region:rollup2
LABOR I WOULD TELL YOU OF COURSE

00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:40.899 region:rollup2
THERE'S FLEXIBILITY YOU CAN

00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:42.734 region:rollup2
ALLOW YOUR WORKERS TO.

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:44.369 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARILY JOIN A UNION AND

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:45.671 region:rollup2
NOT INTIMIDATE OR HARASS THEM

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:48.240 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY COULD. ACTUALLY

00:26:45.671 --> 00:26:50.042 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE A FLEXIBLE WORK WEEK.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.009 region:rollup2
BUT NOW I KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:26:50.042 --> 00:26:52.644 region:rollup2
THIS TWO THIRDS ELECTION THAT I

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:53.111 region:rollup2
NEVER KNEW EXISTED ACTUALLY

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:54.680 region:rollup2
AMOS'S SO THAT'S VERY

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:55.848 region:rollup2
INTERESTING AS WELL ANOTHER

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.683 region:rollup2
PROVISION BY WHICH.

00:26:55.848 --> 00:26:59.118 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES CAN ASSERT IF THEY

00:26:57.683 --> 00:27:00.853 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE THEIR RIGHT TO

00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:02.020 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES IN A

00:27:00.853 --> 00:27:03.388 region:rollup2
MENU OF FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.390 region:rollup2
SO WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A ONE

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:07.259 region:rollup2
SIZE FITS ALL. SO I THINK THERE

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.795 region:rollup2
IS FLEXIBILITY BUT OF A QUESTION

00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:11.230 region:rollup2
ON WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO AMEND

00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:12.297 region:rollup2
IN IN YOUR BILL.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.765 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN NUMBER PROVISIONS

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:14.266 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING OUT

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.400 region:rollup2
FOR THE WORKER AND THEIR

00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:16.401 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.569 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE A

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:20.172 region:rollup2
PROVISION FOR.

00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:20.539 region:rollup2
WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO.

00:27:20.172 --> 00:27:23.275 region:rollup2
TO.

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:26.178 region:rollup2
REJECT WORKING ON HOLIDAYS.

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:28.881 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ANY REPERCUSSIONS IN

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:30.082 region:rollup2
FACT PROTECTING OTHER SCHEDULES

00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:32.417 region:rollup2
THERE OTHERWISE SCHEDULES E. ON

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:34.720 region:rollup2
TO THEIR JOB IF THEY REFUSE TO

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:36.989 region:rollup2
WORK FOR EXAMPLE ON THANKSGIVING

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.957 region:rollup2
AT WALMART OR CHRISTMAS IT

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:39.691 region:rollup2
DONALD'S.

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.527 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THOSE ARE.

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:43.028 region:rollup2
.

00:27:41.527 --> 00:27:44.830 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW VERY PERTINENT THAT

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:46.198 region:rollup2
TOPIC SAID INTO THE LEGISLATURE

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.033 region:rollup2
BUT PROBABLY NOT GERMANE

00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:50.402 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO THE BILL ITSELF IN

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:51.537 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WOULD BE A GOOD TO VOTE

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.738 region:rollup2
ON INDEPENDENTLY AS THEIR OWN.

00:27:51.537 --> 00:27:55.073 region:rollup2
BUT THE REASON STATED FOR THE

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:56.441 region:rollup2
BILL IS TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:58.043 region:rollup2
WITH THE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT

00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:58.610 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ENJOY A HOLIDAY

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:01.346 region:rollup2
SHOPPING. COOKING FOR THEIR

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:03.382 region:rollup2
KIDS.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:04.383 region:rollup2
BUT THAT SEEMS.

00:28:03.382 --> 00:28:05.918 region:rollup2
COUNTER. IF IF IN FACT THEY

00:28:04.383 --> 00:28:06.985 region:rollup2
CAN'T EVEN BE HOME WITH THEIR

00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:08.887 region:rollup2
KIDS ON THE HOLIDAYS AT THEIR

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:10.155 region:rollup2
OWN CHOOSING.

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:11.690 region:rollup2
WELL IN IS THIS DOES IS IT

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:13.158 region:rollup2
ALLOWS FOR A WRITTEN AGREEMENT

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.260 region:rollup2
TO BE BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:16.795 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE AND SO THAT'S EASILY

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.463 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:19.765 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE INTEREST IN TERMS OF

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:21.400 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THOSE DAYS WHICH WERE

00:28:19.765 --> 00:28:23.035 region:rollup2
THE DAYS IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.803 region:rollup2
I. HAS OFF BECAUSE THAT'S THE

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:26.672 region:rollup2
WHOLE IDEA IS TO BE ABLE HOW THE

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:28.941 region:rollup2
FLEX TIME BY TO ALLOW THE TEN

00:28:26.672 --> 00:28:30.576 region:rollup2
HOUR DAYS TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE

00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:32.010 region:rollup2
DAYS OFF. AND SO SO THAT IS

00:28:30.576 --> 00:28:33.212 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.214 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE

00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:36.848 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BY DIRECTLY FIRE

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:37.683 region:rollup2
STAND I UNDERSTAND THE POINT A

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:38.550 region:rollup2
POINT THAT YOU HAVE AND I THINK

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:41.820 region:rollup2
THAT THIS.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.921 region:rollup2
THIS UP ALLOWS FOR. EMPLOYEES

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.524 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE EMPOWERED TO

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:47.092 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF

00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:48.627 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.795 region:rollup2
WELL I AM I STRONGLY DISAGREE

00:28:48.627 --> 00:28:50.796 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU SEE ANY.

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:52.631 region:rollup2
OR OR MAYBE TOUCH YOUR

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:54.499 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS AS AS I DO ALWAYS

00:28:52.631 --> 00:28:55.133 region:rollup2
AROUND THE HOLIDAY TIME ON ON

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:56.435 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE.

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:58.437 region:rollup2
YOU'LL KNOW THAT THEIR NUMBER

00:28:56.435 --> 00:28:59.905 region:rollup2
OF EMPLOYERS IN FACT TO HOTEL

00:28:58.437 --> 00:29:01.240 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND ACTUALLY POSTED TO

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:03.842 region:rollup2
THEIR EMPLOYEES THAT IF THEY.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.977 region:rollup2
EVEN ATTEMPTED TAKE A LEGALLY

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:06.445 region:rollup2
PROTECTED SICK DAY DURING THE

00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:07.179 region:rollup2
HOLIDAYS THAT THEY WILL LOSE

00:29:06.445 --> 00:29:09.648 region:rollup2
THEIR JOB.

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:11.650 region:rollup2
AND SO I I A.

00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:12.918 region:rollup2
THINK THAT MY EXPERIENCE IN WORK

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.119 region:rollup2
PLACES PARTICULARLY IN RETAIL

00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:15.087 region:rollup2
AND RESTAURANTS IN AND AND

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:16.521 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THE WORKERS ARE

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:18.357 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE'S NO.

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:19.491 region:rollup2
I'M ABILITY FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO

00:29:18.357 --> 00:29:21.059 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE THEIR INDIVIDUAL

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:21.960 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE EMPLOYER

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:23.595 region:rollup2
AND THIS.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.031 region:rollup2
BILL DEFINITELY DOESN'T GIVE

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:27.466 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEE ANYMORE RIGHTS OR

00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:29.134 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO RETAIN THEIR

EMPLOYMENT AND TO RETAIN THEIR

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:32.237 region:rollup2
SCHEDULING TO RETAIN. AND THEIR

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:34.039 region:rollup2
POSITION A WORKPLACE IF THEY

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:35.240 region:rollup2
WERE TO TRY TO HAVE THOSE EVEN

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:36.008 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT HAVE THOSE NEGOTIATIONS

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.111 region:rollup2
SO I'M GONNA.

00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:40.879 region:rollup2
VOTE NO TODAY AND I AND AND

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:43.048 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT IF EMPLOYERS ONE

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:44.549 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD WITH IDEAS ABOUT

00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:46.184 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES AND

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:47.953 region:rollup2
SECURE WHAT'S WORK SCHEDULES AND

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:48.954 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH EMPLOYEES TO.

00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:49.788 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE MOST

00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:51.256 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF RIGHTS POSSIBLE THAT

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:53.592 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GREAT DISCUSSION TO

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:54.860 region:rollup2
HAVE TOGETHER.

00:29:53.592 --> 00:29:56.662 region:rollup2
INTO REALLY RESPECT

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.462 region:rollup2

BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL I AM

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:16.915 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE SOME. VERY

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:18.617 region:rollup2
VALID CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:19.985 region:rollup2
OUT ABOUT THIS BILL PARTICULARLY

00:30:18.617 --> 00:30:21.520 region:rollup2
WITH PROTECTION OF THEM OF

EMPLOYEES HOWEVER.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.757 region:rollup2
JUST AS.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:27.259 region:rollup2
ONE SUGGEST THAT THERE COULD BE

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:29.628 region:rollup2
SOME INTIMIDATION THAT TAKES

00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:31.330 region:rollup2
PLACE IN TRYING TO. COERCE

00:30:29.628 --> 00:30:34.366 region:rollup2
WORKERS IN IT YOU KNOW I'M

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.933 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING A PARTICULAR. WORK

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:37.102 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED THE WEEK THERE'S

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:38.904 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

00:30:37.102 --> 00:30:41.907 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO EXISTS.

00:30:38.904 --> 00:30:45.010 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAD THE OPTION OF OF A

00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:46.678 region:rollup2
MENU FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE SO THE

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.747 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:49.314 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH IN

00:30:48.747 --> 00:30:51.483 region:rollup2
A IN A LEGAL WAY.

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:53.151 region:rollup2
.

00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:54.853 region:rollup2
THROUGH THROUGH THE LIES IN

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:57.089 region:rollup2
PLACING THE REGULATORY SYSTEM

00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:59.091 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE WHAT I.

00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:00.692 region:rollup2
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT PARTICULARLY

00:30:59.091 --> 00:31:02.060 region:rollup2
DURING HOLIDAYS?

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:04.830 region:rollup2
IS WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.765 region:rollup2

CERTAINLY ENJOY THE HOURS AND I

00:31:16.842 --> 00:31:20.679 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S A.

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:22.147 region:rollup2
A NEGOTIATION THAT SHOULD BE

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:23.749 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THE

00:31:22.147 --> 00:31:25.884 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE SOME MAY

00:31:23.749 --> 00:31:27.052 region:rollup2
NOT WANT TO DO THAT AND OTHERS

00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:28.820 region:rollup2
MAY CHOOSE TO DO THAT I KNOW I

TEN HOUR DAY AND WE HAVE A LOT

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:50.642 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM ARE UNIONIZED.

00:31:47.973 --> 00:31:52.110 region:rollup2

SOMEONE SOMEONE WORK IS OUR SOME

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.179 region:rollup2
DON'T I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE

00:31:53.178 --> 00:31:56.281 region:rollup2
THE OPTION I THINK WHEN WE TAKE

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:57.949 region:rollup2
THAT OPTION AWAY. FROM EMPLOYEES

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:59.418 region:rollup2
AND EMPLOYERS THAT AND WE WERE

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.418 region:rollup2
GOING FURTHER DOWN THE PATH OF

00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:02.220 region:rollup2
MAKING EMPLOYEES MORE

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:04.022 region:rollup2
SUBSERVIENT TO THE STATE WHICH

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.123 region:rollup2

THIS FORWARD.

00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:18.403 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT TO SUGGEST THAT A

00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:20.438 region:rollup2
WORKER IS IN THE SAME BARGAINING

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:21.740 region:rollup2
POSITION AS AN INDIVIDUAL. WITH

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:23.408 region:rollup2
AN EMPLOYER IS JUST NOT REALITY

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.843 region:rollup2
AND AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:26.978 region:rollup2
HOLIDAY SEASON JUST BECAUSE.

00:32:24.843 --> 00:32:29.848 region:rollup2
SOMEONE IS SEEKING ACTUAL PLAN

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:30.348 region:rollup2
INNER EXTRA RESOURCES EXTRA CASH

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:31.216 region:rollup2
IN THE HOLIDAYS WHATEVER

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:33.718 region:rollup2
WHATEVER REASON.

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:35.053 region:rollup2
IN NO WAY MEANS THAT THEY DON'T.

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:36.588 region:rollup2
DESERVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY IN

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.755 region:rollup2
THE SAME RIGHTS TO BE ABLE.

00:32:36.588 --> 00:32:38.790 region:rollup2
TO.

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:39.791 region:rollup2
.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.727 region:rollup2
THE COMPENSATOR PROPERLY AND I

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:44.930 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THIS BILL WOULD.

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:46.198 region:rollup2
A ESSENTIALLY ALLOW FOR TEN HOUR

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:48.233 region:rollup2
WORK DAYS WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY

00:32:46.198 --> 00:32:50.168 region:rollup2
OVERTIME AND WE DO HAVE A

00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:51.369 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROCESS REQUIRES. A MORE

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:53.338 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:54.973 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:56.975 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT.

00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:58.877 region:rollup2
IT THERE IS TRULY CONCERN

00:32:56.975 --> 00:33:00.779 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE HOLIDAYS AND

00:32:58.877 --> 00:33:02.781 region:rollup2
ALLOWING WORKERS STEP PERHAPS IS

A TO SPEND TIME THEIR FAMILY I

00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:05.217 region:rollup2
HOPE. I WOULD HOPE MORE

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.585 region:rollup2
RETAILERS WOULDN'T REQUIRE THEIR

00:33:05.217 --> 00:33:08.186 region:rollup2

DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON SO

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:39.584 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN SPEND MORE TIME

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:02.340 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE CASE I WOULD NOT

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:03.675 region:rollup2
WANNA PUT WORKERS IN A POSITION

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.509 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY WILL BE VULNERABLE.

00:34:03.675 --> 00:34:07.312 region:rollup2
ONTO ESSENTIALLY EARNING LESS

00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:08.179 region:rollup2
MONEY AND WORKING ON A MORE

00:34:07.312 --> 00:34:09.481 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS WOULD YOU.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.750 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:13.318 region:rollup2
WHAT WE BUILT INTO THIS BILL IS

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.519 region:rollup2
THE THE AGREEMENT THE CONTRACT

00:34:13.318 --> 00:34:16.087 region:rollup2
AYE AND THAT CONTRACT IS

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:17.355 region:rollup2
VOIDABLE BY THE EMPLOYEE AT ANY

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:18.823 region:rollup2
TIME. AYE AND SO YOU HAVE A

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:20.592 region:rollup2
SITUATION I THINK HERE WHERE

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:21.793 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES ARE I CAN BE PROTECTED

00:34:20.592 --> 00:34:22.994 region:rollup2
AND BE ABLE TO DECIDE AGAINST

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.728 region:rollup2
THIS IF THEY CHOSE TO DO THEIR

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:24.529 region:rollup2
SIDE IT.

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.830 region:rollup2
AND ANY TIME I THINK THAT

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.998 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FOR THE FLEXIBILITY

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.532 region:rollup2
THAT THAT I'M THAT I'M SEEKING

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:29.234 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:30.769 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES. ARE SEEKING WITHIN

00:34:29.234 --> 00:34:32.570 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO

00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:35.140 region:rollup2
THE POINT THAT THERE IS ALREADY

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.841 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR HOW.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.743 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES CAN.

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:40.645 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A FLEXIBLE WORK

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:41.880 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:43.949 region:rollup2
BUILT IN.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.317 region:rollup2
CAPTION FROM ANYONE EMPLOYEE

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:46.851 region:rollup2
BEING SINGLED OUT BECAUSE IT IS

00:34:45.317 --> 00:34:48.753 region:rollup2
OF VOTE AS OPPOSED TO A

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:49.621 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:52.057 region:rollup2
MANAGER AT WOULD YOU ALL SPEAK

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:54.993 region:rollup2
TO THAT.

00:34:52.057 --> 00:34:56.528 region:rollup2
I IF I CAN I THINK SHE HAS THE

00:34:54.993 --> 00:34:57.662 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE TO PLACE MORE MORE

00:34:56.528 --> 00:34:58.597 region:rollup2
ARTICULATELY AND I'M MORE

00:34:57.662 --> 00:35:00.699 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY I ANSWER THAT

00:34:58.597 --> 00:35:01.666 region:rollup2
QUESTION YES THE MODEL RIGHT NOW

00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:02.601 region:rollup2
IS ESSENTIALLY MORE OF A

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.435 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS

00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:05.937 region:rollup2
WHO DOESN'T APPROACH

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:07.339 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALIZE NEAT SO WHAT

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:10.141 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IS IN LET'S SAY MOM.

00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:10.875 region:rollup2
WANTS TO HAVE EVERYONE SEE OFF

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:11.876 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR TOP WITHOUT A

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:12.844 region:rollup2
MINIMUM DAY THIS DOESN'T

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:14.045 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT NEED WHAT HAPPENS

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:15.280 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT MUST BE A TWO THIRDS

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:16.314 region:rollup2
VOTE BY THE ENTIRE WORK UNIT

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.582 region:rollup2
WHICH COULD BE LET'S SAY ALL

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:19.284 region:rollup2
SECRETARIES OF COURSE IN THE

00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:21.119 region:rollup2
RETAIL INDUSTRY IT WOULD BE. YOU

KNOW ALL MAKE A COUNTER PLEASE

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.588 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY'VE

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.189 region:rollup2
TO VOTE BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE

00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:25.724 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THERE HAS TO BE A

00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:29.461 region:rollup2

HAPPEN.

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.365 region:rollup2
IN ORDER FOR IT TO PASS THE NEW

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.600 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES HAVE TO AGREE ON AN

00:35:33.365 --> 00:35:36.735 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULE OR AS

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.502 region:rollup2
A MENU OF OPTIONS HOWEVER THERE

00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:38.803 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO DOCUMENTATION

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:40.105 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS. AND TO NOTICE

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:42.574 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT THE EMPLOYERS

00:35:40.105 --> 00:35:44.776 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ABIDE BY IN ORDER TO NOT

00:35:42.574 --> 00:35:45.977 region:rollup2
I'M A BIT EXPOSED LITIGATION

00:35:44.776 --> 00:35:47.078 region:rollup2
THEN ONCE THAT OCCURS THEN IS

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.113 region:rollup2
POST ON THE DEPARTMENT OF

MORE EXPOSED LITIGATION. SO THE

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.823 region:rollup2
ISSUE WITH THAT IS THAT THERE'S

00:35:56.421 --> 00:36:01.059 region:rollup2

OUT IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS THAT

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:57.495 region:rollup2
ARE LONG OVERDUE TO PREVENT

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.097 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND EATING

00:39:57.495 --> 00:40:01.399 region:rollup2

THESE INDUSTRIES IS RAMPANT.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.672 region:rollup2
I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND AFTER

WORKING AS A MODEL SINCE I WAS

00:40:07.672 --> 00:40:11.209 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN YEARS OLD.

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:12.310 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE AGENTS WHO

00:40:11.209 --> 00:40:13.778 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE OUR FIRST LINE OF

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.813 region:rollup2

COMPLICIT IN THESE ABUSES.

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:19.851 region:rollup2
AND SOME AGENTS EVEN EXHIBIT

00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:21.185 region:rollup2
PREDATORY BEHAVIOR THEMSELVES.

00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:23.354 region:rollup2
IN MY TWO DECADES WORKING AS A

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:25.223 region:rollup2
MODEL. I NEVER RECEIVED TRAINING

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:27.091 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES WORKPLACE

00:40:25.223 --> 00:40:29.460 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT. OR GUIDANCE

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:31.229 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO REPORT ABUSE.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.964 region:rollup2
QUITE THE OPPOSITE AS A TEENAGER

00:40:31.229 --> 00:40:34.766 region:rollup2
I WAS MADE TO SIT ON MY MUCH

00:40:32.964 --> 00:40:36.567 region:rollup2
OLDER MALE AGENTS LACK DURING

00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:39.170 region:rollup2
OUR MEETINGS AT THE AGENCY.

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:40.138 region:rollup2
I WAS ROUTINELY SENT TO

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.839 region:rollup2
SURPRISE NUDE SHOOTS AND

00:40:40.138 --> 00:40:44.309 region:rollup2
CASTINGS EVEN AFTER COMPLAINING

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:45.810 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS TO MY AGENCY.

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:47.612 region:rollup2
ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION MY

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.880 region:rollup2
AGENCY ARRANGED MEETINGS AT THE

00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:50.615 region:rollup2

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.984 region:rollup2
MUCH OLDER MEN.

00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:54.852 region:rollup2
AND UPON ARRIVAL IT BECAME CLEAR

00:40:52.984 --> 00:40:56.287 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS NO JOB.

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:58.256 region:rollup2
I WAS FORCED TO NAVIGATE

00:40:56.287 --> 00:41:00.558 region:rollup2
FENDING OFF UNWANTED ADVANCES

00:40:58.256 --> 00:41:02.293 region:rollup2
WITHOUT RUINING MY CAREER.

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:04.028 region:rollup2
WHEN I BROUGHT MY CONCERNS TO

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:05.797 region:rollup2
THE PRESIDENT OF ONE AGENCY

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:07.498 region:rollup2
ABOUT A WELL KNOWN PHOTOGRAPHER

00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:09.033 region:rollup2
HE SHRUGGED AND SUGGESTED I WAS

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:10.702 region:rollup2
BEING UPTIGHT.

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:12.503 region:rollup2
SHORTLYTHEREAFTER I LEFT THE

00:41:10.702 --> 00:41:14.105 region:rollup2
AGENCY AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:16.040 region:rollup2
NOW BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE

00:41:14.105 --> 00:41:16.908 region:rollup2
NYPD SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT FOR

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.777 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS ALLEGATIONS BY MODELS

00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:20.912 region:rollup2
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:23.014 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS THAT WOULD CLEARLY

00:41:20.912 --> 00:41:24.315 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND

00:41:23.014 --> 00:41:26.217 region:rollup2
AN OFFICE SETTING ARE LESS EASY

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:27.485 region:rollup2
TO NAVIGATE IN THE MODELING

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:29.253 region:rollup2
ENTERTAINMENT HISTORIES. BUT

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:30.855 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE THE LINES ARE MORE

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:32.090 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO DRAW IT DOES NOT

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:33.691 region:rollup2
MAKE IT ANY MORE OKAYED ACROSS

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:35.026 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:36.361 region:rollup2
I AGENCIES EXERT A GREAT DEAL OF

00:41:35.026 --> 00:41:37.829 region:rollup2
CONTROL OVER THEIR TALENTS

00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:39.430 region:rollup2
WORKING LIVES AND SHOULD NOT BE

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:41.032 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.799 region:rollup2
ABUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE

00:41:41.032 --> 00:41:43.701 region:rollup2
INTERESTS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:44.769 region:rollup2
REPRESENT.

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.870 region:rollup2
RATHER AGENCIES SHOULD

00:41:44.769 --> 00:41:48.506 region:rollup2
PROACTIVELY TAKE STEPS TO

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:49.774 region:rollup2
PREVENT THESE ABUES.

00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:51.676 region:rollup2
EATING DISORDERS ARE ALSO A

00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:53.211 region:rollup2
MAJOR ISSUE WITH RESEARCHERS AT

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:54.412 region:rollup2
HARVARD AT HARVARD IN

00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:55.847 region:rollup2
NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY'S THE

00:41:54.412 --> 00:41:56.948 region:rollup2
MODEL LANCE CONDUCTED THE

00:41:55.847 --> 00:41:58.116 region:rollup2
LARGEST STUDY TO DATE ON EATING

00:41:56.948 --> 00:41:59.984 region:rollup2
DISORDERS AMONGST PROFESSIONAL

00:41:58.116 --> 00:42:01.486 region:rollup2
MODELS.

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:02.754 region:rollup2
THE STUDY CONFIRMED THAT MODELS

00:42:01.486 --> 00:42:04.489 region:rollup2
ARE OFTEN PRESSURE TO LOSE

00:42:02.754 --> 00:42:05.123 region:rollup2
WEIGHT AND JEOPARDY RIGHT

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:06.758 region:rollup2
JEOPARDIZE THEIR HEALTH IN ORDER

00:42:05.123 --> 00:42:07.892 region:rollup2
TO BiC JOBS.

00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:09.093 region:rollup2
WE FOUND A HIGH PREVALENCE OF

00:42:07.892 --> 00:42:11.129 region:rollup2
UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:13.731 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR SUCH AS FASTS

00:42:11.129 --> 00:42:16.401 region:rollup2
DETOX IS USING DIET PILLS AND

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:18.269 region:rollup2
COCAINE. AND VOMITING.

00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:19.470 region:rollup2
AMONG THE MODEL SURVEYED OVER

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:21.439 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT WERE CLASSIFIED

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.740 region:rollup2
AS UNDERWEIGHT.

00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:23.975 region:rollup2
AND YET THESE MODELS REPORTED

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.277 region:rollup2
BEING PRESSURED BY THERE

00:42:23.975 --> 00:42:27.645 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TO LOSE MORE WEIGHT.

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:29.180 region:rollup2
OVER HALF OF THE MODELS WERE

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:31.015 region:rollup2
ASKED TO LOSE WEIGHT OR CHNGE

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.450 region:rollup2
THEIR SHAPE. AND TWENTY ONE

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:34.185 region:rollup2
PERCENT WERE TOLD THEIR AGENCY

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:36.654 region:rollup2
WOULD STOP REPRESENTING THEM

00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:37.955 region:rollup2
UNLESS THEY LOST WEIGHT.

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:39.390 region:rollup2
BEING DANGEROUSLY UNDERWEIGHT

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:41.025 region:rollup2
AND HAVING AN EATING DISORDER

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.460 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES ON

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:43.361 region:rollup2
A YOUNG PERSON'S GROWTH AND

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.762 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THAT CAN AFFECT THEM

00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:46.264 region:rollup2
FOR LIFE.

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:47.698 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS SEVERAL MODELS

00:42:46.264 --> 00:42:49.367 region:rollup2
WHO REPORTEDLY SUFFERED FROM

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:50.868 region:rollup2
EATING DISORDERS HAVE DIED. IN

00:42:49.367 --> 00:42:52.737 region:rollup2
SOME CASES WITHIN MINUTES OF

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:54.505 region:rollup2
STEPPING OFF A RUNWAY.

00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:55.840 region:rollup2
THE PRESSURES FROM AGENCIES TO

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:57.675 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN UNHEALTHY WEIGHT

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.810 region:rollup2
CONTROL BEHAVIORS IS A SERIOUS

00:42:57.675 --> 00:43:01.746 region:rollup2
LABOR ISSUE THAT MUST BE

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:03.081 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED AND TREATED AS SUCH.

00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:04.549 region:rollup2
FURTHER THERE IS OVERWHELMING

00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:06.317 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE.

00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:07.652 region:rollup2
THAT BEING A VICTIM OF SEXUAL

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:09.821 region:rollup2
ASSAULT INCREASES THE RISK OF

00:43:07.652 --> 00:43:11.355 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING AN EATING DISORDER.

00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:13.291 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:15.359 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SEXUAL ABUSE AND EATING

00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:17.128 region:rollup2
DISORDERS IT IS APPROPRIATE

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:18.329 region:rollup2
INDEED NECESSARY. THAT THESE

00:43:17.128 --> 00:43:20.631 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:22.033 region:rollup2
ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED TOGETHER.

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.701 region:rollup2
BY CREATING WHO PROACTIVE

00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:25.436 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS WE AIM TO ESTABLISH

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:27.238 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:28.306 region:rollup2
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. AND

00:43:27.238 --> 00:43:29.707 region:rollup2
THIS WILL CREATE A WORKPLACE

00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:30.942 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE POTENTIAL

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:32.543 region:rollup2
VICTIMS HAVE BEEN EMPOWERED WITH

00:43:30.942 --> 00:43:33.778 region:rollup2
AWARENESS OF THEIR RIGHTS AND

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:35.379 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES NECESSARY IN CASES

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:37.215 region:rollup2
OF ABUSE.

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:38.716 region:rollup2

FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES I'VE

00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:56.300 region:rollup2
WORKED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT

AND AUTHOR.

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:01.973 region:rollup2
IN THAT TIME I'VE INTO WERE

00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:03.374 region:rollup2
COUNTLESS EXPERIENCES OF BOTH

SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:06.644 region:rollup2
ASSAULT.

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:08.346 region:rollup2
AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN I WAS

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:10.548 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY ASSAULTED AND RAPED

00:44:08.346 --> 00:44:12.016 region:rollup2
BY MY THEN AGENT.

00:44:10.548 --> 00:44:13.718 region:rollup2
IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO ME THAT IF

I WERE TO COMPLAIN OR REPORT

00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:17.188 region:rollup2
THESE ASSAULTS IT WOULD MEAN THE

00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:18.723 region:rollup2
END OF MY CAREER.

00:44:17.188 --> 00:44:20.391 region:rollup2
I WAS ADVISED THAT IF I WANTED

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:22.226 region:rollup2
TO SUCCEED AS A MODEL I WOULD

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.760 region:rollup2
NEED TO TOUGHEN UP. WHICH

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.028 region:rollup2
BASICALLY MEANT BITING MY

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.897 region:rollup2
TONGUE.

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:26.464 region:rollup2
AND ALLOWINGINFLUENTIAL MEN IN

00:44:25.897 --> 00:44:28.766 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY TO ABUSE THEIR

00:44:26.464 --> 00:44:29.700 region:rollup2
POWER.

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:31.536 region:rollup2
AND I REFUSED STAY SILENT ANY

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.171 region:rollup2
LONGER.

00:44:31.536 --> 00:44:34.539 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE

00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:35.840 region:rollup2
IN THIS INDUSTRY I'VE

00:44:34.539 --> 00:44:37.642 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT SO

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.343 region:rollup2
OFTEN.

00:44:37.642 --> 00:44:40.711 region:rollup2
AND IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:43.781 region:rollup2
THAT PREDATORY AND ABUSIVE

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:45.049 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WAS NORMALIZED.

00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:45.516 region:rollup2
SADLY I CAME TO ACCEPT THAT

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:47.518 region:rollup2
THESE WERE MY WORKING

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:49.687 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:52.924 region:rollup2
OVER THIRTY YEARS NOT ONE SINGLE

ASSOCIATED WITH THE ILLNESS IS

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:35.472 region:rollup2
TWELVE TIMES HIGHER THEN THE

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:52.910 region:rollup2
TIMING.

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:55.012 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THIS IF PASCO'S GO

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.212 region:rollup2
PREPARATIONS.

00:56:55.012 --> 00:56:56.546 region:rollup2
AND.

00:56:55.212 --> 00:56:58.782 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

00:56:56.546 --> 00:57:00.384 region:rollup2
MOVED IN OR OUT BY NEXT WEEK.

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:02.219 region:rollup2
I HAVE EX

00:57:00.384 --> 00:57:03.987 region:rollup2
STREAM CONCERNS ABOUT MOVING A

00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:05.455 region:rollup2
BILL THAT POLICY REALLY NEEDS BE

00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:06.690 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED OUT OF THIS HOUSE

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:08.492 region:rollup2
S. B. FORTS DEVELOP IN THE

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.826 region:rollup2
POLICY COMMITTEE IN THIS.

00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:11.795 region:rollup2
AND I UNDERSTAND I MEAN WE ALL

00:57:09.826 --> 00:57:13.597 region:rollup2
OF.

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:15.899 region:rollup2
MAKE DECISIONS ON WHERE TO PUT

00:57:13.597 --> 00:57:17.901 region:rollup2
OUR BILLS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:19.703 region:rollup2
AND I'M. I'M THE SAME WAY I'M

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:21.305 region:rollup2
GONNA GO EXPLAIN IT I REALLY

00:57:19.703 --> 00:57:22.306 region:rollup2
THINK THIS BILL SHOULD I STARTED

00:57:21.305 --> 00:57:23.707 region:rollup2
AS A FRESH BELL. I'M I THINK

00:57:22.306 --> 00:57:24.741 region:rollup2
THAT THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

00:57:23.707 --> 00:57:27.110 region:rollup2
AND CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:29.746 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REALISTIC AND.

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:32.683 region:rollup2
NEED SOME VETTING I THINK IT'S

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:34.751 region:rollup2
TOO IMPORTANT VINICIO TOTO RUSH

00:57:32.683 --> 00:57:37.120 region:rollup2
IT THROUGH.

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:38.588 region:rollup2
IN IT IN A WAY THAT THAT

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:42.559 region:rollup2
THERE'S THESE OUTSTANDING

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:43.593 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ONE THAT I HAD OR ONE

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:44.828 region:rollup2
CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT.

00:57:43.593 --> 00:57:45.762 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THOSE IN

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:46.530 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY WHO ARE MOST

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:48.165 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE DON'T EVEN HAVE

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:49.232 region:rollup2
AGENCY REPRESENTATION.

00:57:48.165 --> 00:57:51.201 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE.

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:52.602 region:rollup2
AT.

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:54.671 region:rollup2
WE WORK FOR TACKLING

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:56.406 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:57.975 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN

00:57:56.406 --> 00:57:59.343 region:rollup2
AND THE BUSINESS AND NOT THOSE

00:57:57.975 --> 00:58:00.610 region:rollup2
WHO ARE ARE TRYING TO ENTER THE

00:57:59.343 --> 00:58:03.280 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AND SOMETIMES ARE ARE

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:05.248 region:rollup2
PULLED. HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.283 region:rollup2
OF THEIR RIGHTS AS WELL I THINK

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:07.818 region:rollup2
ALL WORKERS SHOULD BE INFORMED

00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:08.452 region:rollup2
OF THEIR RIGHTS NOT SOMETHING WE

00:58:07.818 --> 00:58:10.253 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT MY AND I'M LOOKING

00:58:08.452 --> 00:58:11.855 region:rollup2
AT ANOTHER BILLS IS WE DON'T IN

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:13.523 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES EVER INFORM

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:14.825 region:rollup2
WORKERS ANY WORKERS.

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.425 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE IN THE

00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:16.793 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:19.196 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THEY'RE RIGHT WHERE

00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:20.597 region:rollup2
THEY GO TO REPORT THOSE RIGHTS

00:58:19.196 --> 00:58:22.032 region:rollup2
MINIMUM COME FROM LABOR THIS IS

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:23.500 region:rollup2
LIKE A HUGE ISSUE AND ONE WHICH

00:58:22.032 --> 00:58:24.534 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO GET RIGHT.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.602 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.770 region:rollup2
ENTERTAINMENT STREETS ONE OF

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:28.839 region:rollup2
MANY MANY INDUSTRIES.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:29.673 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:28.839 --> 00:58:32.476 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF FIGURE

00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:34.511 region:rollup2
OUT AND I'M STILL UNSURE WHY.

00:58:32.476 --> 00:58:35.612 region:rollup2
.

00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:37.180 region:rollup2
IN MOST INDUSTRIES WHEN WE LOOK

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:37.647 region:rollup2
AT THAT SWEET REALLY LOOK AT THE

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.982 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:40.384 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:42.119 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND OF COURSE THIS AGENT

00:58:40.384 --> 00:58:43.353 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:58:42.119 --> 00:58:45.055 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS SO DIFFERENT THAN

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:46.857 region:rollup2
THE TYPICAL EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE

00:58:45.055 --> 00:58:49.026 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP AM VERY AWARE. OF

00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:51.061 region:rollup2
OF THAT

00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:54.364 region:rollup2
IN IN SO WERE PUTTING AN ONUS ON

00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:55.999 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION AND AGENCIES.

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:57.834 region:rollup2
THAT NORMALLY WE REPLACE SEEN ON

00:58:55.999 --> 00:59:00.771 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS

00:58:57.834 --> 00:59:01.338 region:rollup2
I'M AND I KIND OF LIKEN IT TO.

00:59:00.771 --> 00:59:01.671 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I THINK WE HAVE A

00:59:01.338 --> 00:59:03.106 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH.

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:05.108 region:rollup2
.

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:06.843 region:rollup2
WITH CONCUSSIONS IN THE NFL AND

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:08.211 region:rollup2
SO IF I WOULD WANT TO DO A BILL

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:09.112 region:rollup2
ON THAT WHICH I MIGHT OR MIGHT

00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:12.215 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE DONE.

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:15.452 region:rollup2
THAT WE WE WOULD GO.

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:17.421 region:rollup2
TOWARDS ENSURING THAT THE NFL OR

00:59:15.452 --> 00:59:17.888 region:rollup2
OR WORLD FOOTBALL OR COLLEGE

00:59:17.421 --> 00:59:20.323 region:rollup2
FOOTBALL CHANGES THEIR

00:59:17.888 --> 00:59:22.392 region:rollup2
PRACTICES.

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:23.760 region:rollup2
AND NOT GO TOWARDS SPORTS AGENTS

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:25.996 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE THEM TO SOMEHOW

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.098 region:rollup2
CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES.

00:59:25.996 --> 00:59:30.133 region:rollup2
AND HAVE AN UPWARD PUSH ON THE

00:59:28.098 --> 00:59:31.668 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER NOW NOT TOTALLY

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:33.070 region:rollup2
CONVINCED OF MY OWN ARGUMENT

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:34.571 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:35.505 region:rollup2
ABOUT A POWER STRUCTURE WHERE

00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:37.207 region:rollup2
WHERE WORKERS HAVE THE LEAST

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:38.942 region:rollup2
AMOUNT POWER IN AND I'M CONSUMER

00:59:37.207 --> 00:59:40.977 region:rollup2
LEAVING OUT? THE LOWEST.

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:42.412 region:rollup2
EMPOWERED WORKERS I DON'T HAVE

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:43.814 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION THEY HAVE WORKERS

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.815 region:rollup2
WITH REPRESENTATION THEN YOU

00:59:43.814 --> 00:59:46.450 region:rollup2
HAVE THE REPRESENTATION KIND

00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:47.551 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS OTHER SPOT AND THEN

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:49.186 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THE EMPLOYER'S RIGHT

00:59:47.551 --> 00:59:50.654 region:rollup2
WITH WITH. YOU KNOW OF A FASHION

00:59:49.186 --> 00:59:52.322 region:rollup2
HOUSE DECIDES THEY'RE GOING TO

00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:53.090 region:rollup2
HAVE MODELS AT A CERTAIN WEIGHT.

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:54.491 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT A LOT THE AGENT CAN

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:56.159 region:rollup2
DO IT NOW

00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:58.061 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE HAVING.

00:59:56.159 --> 01:00:00.730 region:rollup2
OR CERTAIN LOOK.

00:59:58.061 --> 01:00:02.566 region:rollup2
IT'S COMPLICATED AND THAT'S WHY

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:03.467 region:rollup2
I SUGGEST THAT I THINK IT'S

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:06.503 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:08.205 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE THE.

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:09.940 region:rollup2
TONE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:12.342 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING SOMETHING THAT THEY

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:14.044 region:rollup2
WILL WORK WITH HOPEFULLY AND I

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:16.313 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPECT THIS WITH.

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:17.781 region:rollup2
WITH THE TALENT TO CREATE

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:19.549 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND KIND OF

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:21.351 region:rollup2
PUT SOME IN CONJUNCTION AND HAS

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:22.586 region:rollup2
THEM FIGHTING TOGETHER AGAINST

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:24.488 region:rollup2
KIND OF THIS INDUSTRY THAT'S

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:25.989 region:rollup2
VERY SPECIAL INDUSTRY WHICH IS

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:27.390 region:rollup2
AFFECTING NOT ONLY THE WORKERS

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.092 region:rollup2
