THEIR MONEY IS BEING SPENT.

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:03.869 region:rollup2
THE LOOPHOLES CREATED BY THESE

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:06.272 region:rollup2
COURT DECISIONS ARE ALREADY

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:08.074 region:rollup2
BEING EXPLOITED BY CITIES.

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:09.008 region:rollup2

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.523 region:rollup2
BUT THE CITY USE ONE OF THESE

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:26.092 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLES TO UNDERMINE THE CLEAR

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:27.426 region:rollup2

THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:36.102 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHY THE SAME BROAD BASED

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:37.636 region:rollup2
COALITION THAT CAME TOGETHER

ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:58.023 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS.

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:59.492 region:rollup2
THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT HAS

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:01.527 region:rollup2

BEFORE ANY TAX OR FEES AND ACT.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:15.307 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES NEW REVENUE TO ONLY

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:16.509 region:rollup2
BE SPENT WHERE VOTERS APPROVED

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:18.878 region:rollup2

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:20.179 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

00:21:18.878 --> 00:21:21.580 region:rollup2
AND BY MANDATING THESE

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:23.482 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.352 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS IT MAKES ALL NEW

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:27.553 region:rollup2
LOCAL TAXES INTO SPECIAL TAXES.

00:21:26.352 --> 00:21:29.388 region:rollup2
WHICH ALREADY REQUIRE A TWO

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:31.323 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE TO PASS UNDER

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:33.459 region:rollup2

THESE PROVISIONS ARE NOT NEW

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.063 region:rollup2
CONCEPTS.

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:40.432 region:rollup2
I HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:41.700 region:rollup2

AND HOW OUR FUTURE TAX DOLLARS

00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:52.011 region:rollup2
ARE SPENT.

00:21:50.543 --> 00:21:52.511 region:rollup2
SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS

00:21:52.011 --> 00:21:54.480 region:rollup2
HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:56.015 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.750 region:rollup2

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:12.164 region:rollup2
THE MAYOR'S ASKING FOR PERMANENT

THOSE INVESTMENTS MIGHT ONLY

BEING ABLE TO RAISE REVENUE IN

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:19.231 region:rollup2

THESE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING

00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:42.400 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES A HUNDRED AND 30% JUST

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:44.836 region:rollup2
A IN THIS DECADE --

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.838 region:rollup2
AND I SERVED ON CITY COUNCIL AND

00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:48.506 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THESE ENTITIES DO THIS

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:50.108 region:rollup2
FUND BUDGETING FUND MANAGEMENT

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:51.209 region:rollup2
BUDGETING AND IT'S EASY TO HIDE

00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:52.444 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT.

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.744 region:rollup2
AREN'T MEANT FOR THEIR PURPOSE

00:36:52.444 --> 00:36:56.448 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:36:52.744 --> 00:36:57.949 region:rollup2
AND FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN

00:36:56.448 --> 00:36:59.617 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE A VERY

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:01.419 region:rollup2
GOOD EXAMPLE --

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:03.088 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE ASKED THE

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:04.422 region:rollup2
VOTERS TO APPROVE MEASURE RAM.

00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:05.857 region:rollup2
IT'S ABSENT SALES TAX FOR

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:07.625 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION.

00:37:05.857 --> 00:37:09.194 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS REAUTHORIZED AND THAT

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:11.229 region:rollup2
HE HAS WIDE SUPPORT.

00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:12.564 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CTA THE TRANSPORTATION

00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:13.898 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES DON WHAT THEY TOLD

00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.100 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THEY'RE GONNA DO THEY

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:16.835 region:rollup2
SPENT THE MONEY ON ROADS AND

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.169 region:rollup2
BRIDGES AND IT'S A VERY

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:20.138 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM.

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:21.339 region:rollup2
AND NOW MY TIME IN THE

00:37:20.138 --> 00:37:23.475 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE I'D HAVE TO RUN.

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:25.076 region:rollup2
A LEGISLATION I HAD TO RUN A

00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:26.144 region:rollup2
BILL FOR MEL REUSS.

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:28.046 region:rollup2
BUT DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVING

00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:29.614 region:rollup2
BOND MONEY A BECAUSE IT WAS NO

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:30.715 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY HOMEOWNERS CAN FIND

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:32.450 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:33.651 region:rollup2
WHAT THE BALANCE ON THE BOND WHY

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.086 region:rollup2
THE PAYMENTS WERE GOING UP?

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:36.254 region:rollup2
LAW SCHOOLS WOULD REPURPOSE

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:38.456 region:rollup2
BONDS AND USE THEM FOR OTHER

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:41.126 region:rollup2
PURPOSES AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:43.962 region:rollup2
AUDIT SPECIAL DISTRICTS NOT

00:37:41.126 --> 00:37:44.562 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A MOVING MONEY AROUND

00:37:43.962 --> 00:37:46.598 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR UNINTENDED PURPOSES

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:48.099 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK.

00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:49.868 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:51.469 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY WHAT WHAT WAS YOUR

00:37:49.868 --> 00:37:52.904 region:rollup2
MISSILE ACTUALLY SAID 60% A TWO

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:56.040 region:rollup2
THIRDS [inaudible]

00:37:52.904 --> 00:37:57.575 region:rollup2
MEASURES PASS YES THERE'S A FEW

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.344 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TEN YEAH SO CLEARLY THE

00:37:57.575 --> 00:38:01.012 region:rollup2
VOTERS IF YOU GIVE THEM --

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:02.614 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND EXPLAIN TO THEM

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:04.215 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO THEIR

00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:06.584 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:06.885 region:rollup2
IT MAKES ALL OF US LOOK BAD AS

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:07.752 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:38:06.885 --> 00:38:10.355 region:rollup2
WHEN?

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:12.857 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS GET SPENT AND OTHER

00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:14.425 region:rollup2
PURPOSES AND IT REALLY AROSE

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:18.062 region:rollup2

I'LL BE PUSHING THE LEVER IN

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:24.969 region:rollup2
SPORT IN --

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.137 region:rollup2
IN NOVEMBER BUT I THINK IT'S

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:28.106 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO RESTORE TRUST WITH

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:30.408 region:rollup2
THE TAXPAYERS.

00:38:28.106 --> 00:38:31.509 region:rollup2
AND MAKE MONEY GO WORK SUPPOSED

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.677 region:rollup2
TO GO NAY IN INTENDED PURPOSES

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:34.779 region:rollup2
SO THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HERE

THE OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:41.219 region:rollup2
I HAVE A FEW --

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:43.121 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IS THE YOUR INTENTION IN

00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:44.722 region:rollup2
SPECIFYING THAT ONLY THE ACTUAL

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.357 region:rollup2
COSTS CAN BE IMPOSED FOR CHARGER

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:47.926 region:rollup2
IFFY.

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:49.360 region:rollup2
AND HOWARD LOCALS GOING TO BE

00:38:47.926 --> 00:38:53.464 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PROVE ITS APPROVED THE

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.499 region:rollup2
BILL THE ACTUAL COST.

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:58.069 region:rollup2
BUT IT MANAGER THANK YOU --

00:38:54.499 --> 00:39:00.205 region:rollup2
THE THE BUT THAT THAT'S A CHANGE

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:01.739 region:rollup2
IN THE LAW FOR PROP TWENTY SIX

00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:04.209 region:rollup2
REQUIRE REASONABLE COSTS ARE THE

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:05.510 region:rollup2
STANDARD THERE WAS --

00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:07.078 region:rollup2
IT ONLY HAD TO BE --

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.112 region:rollup2
THAT THE STANDARD TO DETERMINE

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:09.447 region:rollup2
IF AS A RESULT BECAUSE IT HAD TO

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:10.448 region:rollup2
BE A PREPONDERANCE OF THE

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:12.517 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:13.418 region:rollup2
IS REASONABLE.

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.086 region:rollup2
THAT STANDARD REALLY PROVIDED

00:39:13.418 --> 00:39:17.255 region:rollup2
KNOWS NO STANDARD AT ALL SORT OF

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:18.456 region:rollup2
IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER --

00:39:17.255 --> 00:39:19.524 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:20.592 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR GOVERNMENT TO

00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:22.594 region:rollup2
SHOW.

00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:23.928 region:rollup2
WHAT DO TO SHOW THEIR WORK --

00:39:22.594 --> 00:39:25.196 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT WAS A REASONABLE

00:39:23.928 --> 00:39:26.364 region:rollup2
STATEMENT REASONABLE COST NOW

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:28.499 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DISCONNECT TO SHOW

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:29.534 region:rollup2
ACTUAL COSTS --

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:31.135 region:rollup2
SO THE THEY THE GOVERNMENT HAS

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:32.704 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON ON BUT THEY PUT

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:34.339 region:rollup2
INTO YOU KNOW PROGRAM A

00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:35.506 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMATIC CHARGE --

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:35.974 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S A THEY'RE GONNA

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:37.308 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SHOW UNDER THE

00:39:35.974 --> 00:39:38.076 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE.

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:42.046 region:rollup2
BUT THE ACTUAL COSTS IS

00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:44.249 region:rollup2
DETERMINED INCORRECTLY.

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:45.750 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY IF IF THE ACTUAL COSTS

00:39:44.249 --> 00:39:47.485 region:rollup2
IS DETERMINED INCORRECTLY WELL

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.754 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WOULD.

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:51.222 region:rollup2
DEPEND ON WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:51.990 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN RUSSIAN --

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:53.992 region:rollup2
AND THAT DEPENDS IF THERE'S A

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.592 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE TO THE TO THE TO THE

00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:56.594 region:rollup2
CHARGE AND IT THEN IT COULD BE

00:39:54.592 --> 00:39:58.963 region:rollup2
CORRECTED.

00:39:56.594 --> 00:40:00.498 region:rollup2
THIS THIS IT MAKES ME NERVOUS IS

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:01.966 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE AND I AND I

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:04.102 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE WE'RE GOING WITH IT

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:05.903 region:rollup2

HERE THAT SPONSORING THE ME

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:06.804 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE AND WHERE IS THE

00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:08.406 region:rollup2
MONEY GOING.

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:10.575 region:rollup2
I WORRY ABOUT MY RURAL

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:11.910 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND EVERYBODY KNOWS

00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:13.311 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY NUMBER ONE THING WHAT

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.779 region:rollup2
WORKS IN ONE PLACE MAY NOT WORK

00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:16.414 region:rollup2
IN ANOTHER.

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:18.383 region:rollup2
AND I LOOK BACK ON THE DAYS WHEN

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:19.217 region:rollup2
I WAS SITTINGON THE DIET SO AS

00:40:18.383 --> 00:40:20.084 region:rollup2
BEING A MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL

00:40:19.217 --> 00:40:22.553 region:rollup2
TOWN.

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:23.187 region:rollup2
IS TWO THIRDS IS VERY DIFFICULT.

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:26.457 region:rollup2
AND THAT WORRIES THAT WE WE HAVE

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:27.959 region:rollup2
--

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:29.260 region:rollup2
SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

00:40:27.959 --> 00:40:30.628 region:rollup2
THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.630 region:rollup2
THINKING OF OUR SMART SMALLER

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:34.365 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES I MEAN YOU KNOW I I

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.834 region:rollup2
FRET.

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:37.702 region:rollup2
OVER WHAT WE COULD DO TO GET

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:39.370 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROJECTS WE WOULD

00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:41.172 region:rollup2
ONE OF GOT GOTTEN DONE --

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.740 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:44.375 region:rollup2
KNOW OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.611 region:rollup2
IS NOT ALWAYS INCLUDED IN SOME

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:48.246 region:rollup2
OF THESE THINGS SO I'M JUST A

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:49.681 region:rollup2
REAL FRETFUL ON IT --

00:40:48.246 --> 00:40:51.082 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS IS THAT --

00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:53.051 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE.

00:40:51.082 --> 00:40:53.818 region:rollup2
SAYS ELIMINATES THE DISTINCTION

00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:55.687 region:rollup2
BETWEEN GENERAL AND SPECIAL

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:57.021 region:rollup2

APPROVAL FOR ALL LOCAL TAXES

00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:02.794 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A SEPARATE STATEMENT.

00:41:00.992 --> 00:41:04.295 region:rollup2
IN A TAX ORDINANCE OF HOW FUNDS

00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:06.297 region:rollup2
MAY BE USED.

I USED IF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:09.400 region:rollup2
IF FOR GENERAL GOVERNMENT THE

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.835 region:rollup2

00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:42.734 region:rollup2
SIX TODAY I I THINK --

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:44.435 region:rollup2
NO VOTERS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO

00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:45.937 region:rollup2
EXPECT A PARCEL TAXES OSMOND

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:47.238 region:rollup2
CASE FOR LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS

00:41:45.937 --> 00:41:48.506 region:rollup2
WOULD BE APPROVED BY A TWO

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:52.043 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE.

00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:52.543 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S THERE'S

00:41:52.043 --> 00:41:56.381 region:rollup2
BY ANY REASON THAT THEY

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:58.082 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T READ --

00:41:56.381 --> 00:41:58.916 region:rollup2
THE THE REASON THAT HAD TO BE

00:41:58.082 --> 00:41:59.517 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THE MEASURE IS YOU

SOAKED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT

00:42:05.957 --> 00:42:08.993 region:rollup2

THE VOTERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:15.933 region:rollup2
TO WEIGH IN ON THIS INITIATIVE

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:17.502 region:rollup2

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:32.270 region:rollup2
OF THE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES

THE DAIS IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES

ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE OVERTAXED.

00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:40.344 region:rollup2
OR DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:43.180 region:rollup2
BRIBE PUBLIC SERVICES THAT

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:45.182 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DEMAND.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.851 region:rollup2
BUT I MUST TELL YOU I'M ANGRY

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:48.419 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE.

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:51.689 region:rollup2
AND AND I'M ANGRY ABOUT IT

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:54.759 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS A NEW MAYOR.

00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:56.494 region:rollup2
WHO'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO RAISE

00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:58.529 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC CAPITAL TO

00:44:56.494 --> 00:45:00.898 region:rollup2
GROW.

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:03.100 region:rollup2
MY CITY'S ECONOMY.

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:04.402 region:rollup2
IN MY VIEW THIS IN IT INITIATIVE

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.204 region:rollup2
IS BOTH DISINGENUOUS AND A GROSS

00:45:04.402 --> 00:45:08.239 region:rollup2
OVER REACH.

00:45:06.204 --> 00:45:10.608 region:rollup2
AND SO LET'S TELL IT LIKE IT IS

00:45:08.239 --> 00:45:11.943 region:rollup2
HERE HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:45:10.608 --> 00:45:14.178 region:rollup2
THAT UP A DECISION THAT WAS

00:45:11.943 --> 00:45:16.180 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO A COUPLE OF TIMES

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:17.949 region:rollup2
CREATED SOME AMBIGUITY ABOUT

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.916 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT.

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:22.053 region:rollup2
I INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TAXES COULD

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:24.288 region:rollup2
BE PAST.

00:45:22.053 --> 00:45:26.290 region:rollup2
BOB BY A MAJORITY VOTE --

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:29.493 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:31.862 region:rollup2
ABOUT A BODY OF LOCAL VOTERS.

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:33.965 region:rollup2
AND SO RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIX

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:35.233 region:rollup2
A SMALL PROBLEM.

00:45:33.965 --> 00:45:36.801 region:rollup2
WHAT THE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS

00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:38.569 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE HERE IS TO TRY TO

00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:40.271 region:rollup2
DRIVE AYE AN IDEOLOGICAL MACK

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:43.341 region:rollup2
TRUCK?

00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:45.643 region:rollup2
THROUGH AN OPENING. TO REALLY

00:45:43.341 --> 00:45:46.611 region:rollup2
UPHOLD THEIR IDEOLOGICAL VIEW OF

00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:49.313 region:rollup2
THE WORLD AND IT'S MOST

00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:52.149 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE.

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:54.986 region:rollup2
IF THE ARGUMENT IS THAT NO

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:56.320 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TAX.

00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:58.322 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE PASSED ON A MAJORITY

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.024 region:rollup2
VOTE.

00:45:58.322 --> 00:46:01.826 region:rollup2
OKAY FOR THIS IS SUPPORTED

00:46:00.024 --> 00:46:03.194 region:rollup2
STRONGLY BY THREE INDUSTRIES THE

00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:04.328 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE INDUSTRY THE ALCOHOL

00:46:03.194 --> 00:46:05.563 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:07.632 region:rollup2
AND THE OIL INDUSTRY IF THAT'S

00:46:05.563 --> 00:46:08.799 region:rollup2
THE ARGUMENT.

00:46:07.632 --> 00:46:10.835 region:rollup2
I COULD ACTUALLY NOT ONLY

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:11.769 region:rollup2
RESPECTED I MIGHT STAND BEHIND

00:46:10.835 --> 00:46:13.971 region:rollup2
IT ESPECIALLY IF IT WERE A

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:16.374 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE.

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:19.410 region:rollup2
JUXTAPOSED TO WHAT THIS IS

00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:22.280 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'VE DONE.

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:24.815 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE WIDENED THEIR GRAFT

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.517 region:rollup2
GRASP TO SAY THAT EVEN IF A

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:28.552 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO RAISE

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:30.821 region:rollup2
A SALES TAX.

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:33.090 region:rollup2
WHICH A TRIED AND TRUE WAY.

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:34.358 region:rollup2
TRYING TO RAISE REVENUE FOR CITY

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:37.662 region:rollup2
THAT IT NOW WILL REQUIRE A TWO

00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:37.962 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE WHAT A DAMAGING

00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:40.831 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:42.566 region:rollup2
OVERREACH WHAT AN ABUSE OF

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:44.335 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY ACTUALLY AND I RESPECT

THE INITIATIVE PROCESS I ALSO

00:46:44.335 --> 00:46:47.471 region:rollup2
DID THE INITIATIVE REFORM.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.706 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD GIVE THIS LEGISLATURE

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:52.043 region:rollup2
THE NEXT TWENTY OR THIRTY DAYS

00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:53.444 region:rollup2

NUMBER TIMES ARE NOT INTERESTED.

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:05.222 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS IDEOLOGICAL.

00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:06.757 region:rollup2

FROM.

00:47:19.103 --> 00:47:23.240 region:rollup2
IS TO TAKE A SPECIFIC PROBLEM.

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:27.845 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF SEEKING JUST TO SOLVE

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:30.781 region:rollup2
IT. TO GO SO OVER BROAD.

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:32.917 region:rollup2
THAT IT HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:33.517 region:rollup2

TO ACTUAL.

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:03.220 region:rollup2
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS THAT --

00:57:02.653 --> 00:57:04.655 region:rollup2
WILL WE'RE GONNA GET STRONG

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:07.658 region:rollup2
MAJORITY.

00:57:04.655 --> 00:57:09.593 region:rollup2
WE END UP WITH 6263% NOT ONLY

00:57:07.658 --> 00:57:11.228 region:rollup2
CAN'T I REALIZE THAT VISION OF

00:57:09.593 --> 00:57:12.663 region:rollup2
MORE CAPITAL.

00:57:11.228 --> 00:57:14.097 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A BUSINESS PROPOSITION

00:57:12.663 --> 00:57:15.332 region:rollup2
IN MY CITY.

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:17.000 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO

00:57:15.332 --> 00:57:19.603 region:rollup2
CUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.071 region:rollup2
OF WITH THOSE BASIC SERVICES AND

00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:22.506 region:rollup2
SINCE MOST OF THE BUDGET OF

00:57:21.071 --> 00:57:24.107 region:rollup2
COURSE MY CITY AND OTHER CITIES

00:57:22.506 --> 00:57:25.509 region:rollup2
IS PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:27.210 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE POLICE AND FIRE

00:57:25.509 --> 00:57:28.545 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I'M UPSET ABOUT THIS

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:30.113 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A GROSS OVER REACH

00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:31.481 region:rollup2
YOU COULD HAVE.

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:34.117 region:rollup2

IT IS WHAT IT IS THAT'S A FIX

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:48.165 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:50.200 region:rollup2
AGREE OR DISAGREE.

00:57:48.165 --> 00:57:52.436 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT NECESSARY.

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.004 region:rollup2
WHY ME GOT IMPOSED A TWO THIRDS

THAT YOU SECURITY ILLOGICAL.

00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:01.111 region:rollup2

00:57:59.443 --> 00:58:01.611 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRO BUSINESS

00:58:01.111 --> 00:58:03.981 region:rollup2
MAYORS HAVE PRO BUSINESS

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:05.749 region:rollup2
AGENDAS.

00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:07.784 region:rollup2
WHO WANT --

00:58:05.749 --> 00:58:10.354 region:rollup2
TO RAISE A TAX TO HELP CREATE

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:12.456 region:rollup2

SO I KNOW THIS IS --

00:58:21.398 --> 00:58:25.602 region:rollup2
HEARING IT'S REQUIRED BY LAW.

00:58:22.966 --> 00:58:26.236 region:rollup2
AGAIN UNDER INITIATIVE REFORM

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:29.539 region:rollup2

MADAM CHAIR YOU ASKED A QUESTION

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:37.274 region:rollup2
OF THE PROPONENTS EARLIER ABOUT

00:59:35.172 --> 00:59:39.009 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DISTORT THE THE WILL OF

00:59:37.274 --> 00:59:40.677 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE YOU BET IT DOES.

00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:44.081 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:45.682 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO DO IT WANTS TO BLOCK

00:59:44.081 --> 00:59:47.684 region:rollup2
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:50.554 region:rollup2
AND WHAT KIND OF A DEMOCRACY DO

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:52.322 region:rollup2
WE LIVE AND WHERE WE ARE TRYING

00:59:50.554 --> 00:59:54.257 region:rollup2
TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THAT AND

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:57.360 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALIZE IT AT THE

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:57.928 region:rollup2
INSTANCE OF A FEW CORPORATIONS

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.895 region:rollup2
THAT WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN

00:59:57.928 --> 01:00:00.831 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:02.799 region:rollup2
OF YOU KNOW WHY IS THE BEVERAGE

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:03.433 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY SO INTERESTED IN THE

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:05.569 region:rollup2
SENATE --

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:08.104 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND PUT UP 80% OF THE

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:08.805 region:rollup2
MONEY SO FAR THAT WE KNOW ABOUT

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.340 region:rollup2
IF -- I

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:12.142 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE STATISTIC

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.111 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY WELL THERE'S FOUR

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:18.048 region:rollup2
CITIES OUT OF ALL THE CITIES IN

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:19.282 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR CITIES HAVE VOTED

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:22.819 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:24.588 region:rollup2
A FEE ON SODA.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:27.624 region:rollup2
NOW WHY HAVE THEY DONE THAT.

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:31.895 region:rollup2
THEY DID THAT IN FURTHERANCE OF

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:35.131 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:35.932 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WELFARE

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:36.533 region:rollup2
OF THEIR CITIZENS BUT IT'S NOT

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.801 region:rollup2
LIKE THE CITY COUNCIL JUST AT

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:40.403 region:rollup2
IT.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:42.839 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IN

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:46.076 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT PASSED BY

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:46.977 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY TO PASS BY

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:49.679 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS NO [inaudible]

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:52.149 region:rollup2
AND VATS WHY.

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:54.284 region:rollup2
THE BEVERAGE COMPANIES ARE

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:56.219 region:rollup2
SPENDING THAT KIND OF UNDER

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:57.988 region:rollup2
GODLY AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:59.756 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SPENDING IN ORDER TO

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:01.124 region:rollup2
QUALIFY THIS AND THEY'LL BE

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:03.293 region:rollup2
DOING THAT.

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:04.995 region:rollup2
TO PUSH IT THROUGH TWO NOW LET'S

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:07.664 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS IN

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:09.499 region:rollup2
ONE COMMUNITY AND I I THINK MOST

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:11.468 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:13.003 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW A AND A PICKLE LONG

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:18.408 region:rollup2
WITH THAT MAYOR STEINBERG AT WAS

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:20.610 region:rollup2
A PROPONENT OF OF THE HELPING.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:21.745 region:rollup2
TO RAISE REVENUE TO COMBAT --

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:24.180 region:rollup2
DE ID THIS --

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:26.082 region:rollup2
THE EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES AND

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.150 region:rollup2
HEART DISEASE THAT'S AFFECTING

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:30.420 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:31.788 region:rollup2
BUT IN BERKELEY THAT THAT FEES

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.890 region:rollup2
RAISED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:35.625 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT'S BEING USED TO

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:37.360 region:rollup2
ADDRESS CHILD NUTRITION AND

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:38.528 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.364 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:43.033 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE KNOW THE TAXES AND

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:45.402 region:rollup2
FEES FOR DECADES HAVE BEEN

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:46.403 region:rollup2
INEFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:48.038 region:rollup2
OUT WE SEEN THEM WORK WITH

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:49.739 region:rollup2
TOBACCO AND NOW WE'RE SEEING IT

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:54.211 region:rollup2
AS A AS I JUST MENTIONED IT'S

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:54.778 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH SODA BUT SINCE.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.813 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT LET'S

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:59.316 region:rollup2
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS

01:01:56.813 --> 01:02:00.917 region:rollup2
ADULT SMOKING HAS DECLINED OVER

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:02.586 region:rollup2
50% AND CALIFORNIA.

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:03.887 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN CURRENT CREDIT I

01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:04.387 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.655 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS AND IT'S BEEN

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.957 region:rollup2
STUDIED.

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:08.425 region:rollup2
WE CAN CREDIT A SIGNIFICANT

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:10.927 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THAT IMPACT TO THE

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:13.296 region:rollup2
TOBACCO TAXES THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:13.897 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN PASSING SINCE THE

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:15.532 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTIES.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.700 region:rollup2
AND THOSE WERE STATEWIDE MEASURE

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:18.902 region:rollup2
SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:21.738 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HERE BUT I'D LIKE

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:24.140 region:rollup2
US ALL TO IMAGINE A SCENARIO

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.674 region:rollup2
WHERE THOSE TAXES WOULD HAVE

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.476 region:rollup2
REQUIRED.

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:29.846 region:rollup2
A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY AND NEVER

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:31.881 region:rollup2
PASSED WHERE WOULD WE BE TODAY

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:35.585 region:rollup2
ON THE ISSUE OF SMOKING.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:38.221 region:rollup2
IF WE HAD NOT HAD THAT REVENUE

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:40.423 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY TO SPEND THAT

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:42.626 region:rollup2
MONEY TO ADDRESS A DIFFERENT

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:44.194 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN.

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:45.395 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE GOT THESE FOUR CITIES

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:50.767 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:52.302 region:rollup2
I AND I IN IN BERKELEY.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.004 region:rollup2
SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE SALES

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:56.439 region:rollup2
HAVE DROPPED BY 10% BUT WATER IS

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:57.073 region:rollup2
GOING UP BY 16% FOLKS.

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:59.342 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE STILL BUYING

01:02:57.073 --> 01:03:01.511 region:rollup2
BEVERAGES.

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:02.846 region:rollup2
ANOTHER STUDY SHOWED THAT OF THE

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:05.749 region:rollup2
SUGARY BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION

01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:08.184 region:rollup2
DECREASED BY 21% IN BERKELEY'S

01:03:05.749 --> 01:03:10.086 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND LET

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:12.522 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REMINDER.

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:15.158 region:rollup2
THAT THE EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:16.993 region:rollup2
AND HEART DISEASE AFFECTS LOW

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:18.962 region:rollup2
INCOME COMMUNITIES MORE THAN

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.897 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:24.267 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE MORE

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:25.902 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BY THIS EPIDEMIC.

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:28.305 region:rollup2
SO FEES A BIT AND IT A POWERFUL

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:29.873 region:rollup2
TOOL JUST AS THE TOBACCO TAXES

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:32.142 region:rollup2
BEEN NOT JUST FOR CHANGING

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:35.545 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR BUT FOR GENERATING.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:38.581 region:rollup2
THE KINDS OF REVENUE IT TAKES.

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:39.616 region:rollup2
TO A A CREATE PROGRAMS THAT

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:42.752 region:rollup2
BENEFIT.

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:44.387 region:rollup2

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:56.760 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS.

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:58.294 region:rollup2
EASY MONEY OFF THE TABLE TO GET

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:00.430 region:rollup2
IT AND TRIED TO GET IN ORDER TO

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:01.464 region:rollup2
STAY BUILDINGS WORK REALTORS GET

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.500 region:rollup2
TENANTS IN THERE ARE KNOWN

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:05.568 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE LIKE LAST.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.237 region:rollup2
STERN 2% OCCUPANCY RATE SO BUT

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:10.006 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO TO

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:11.274 region:rollup2
COME UP IT IN SACRAMENTO --

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:12.709 region:rollup2
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT THAT

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:14.244 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATES ME IS.

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:16.679 region:rollup2
ISSUES COME UP LIKE THE HOUSING

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:18.081 region:rollup2
CRISIS NOBODY GOES DOWN.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:19.449 region:rollup2
AND ASK THE QUESTION WHY DO WE

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:21.851 region:rollup2
HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:23.720 region:rollup2
PART OF IT IS.

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:26.556 region:rollup2
DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES LUMBER

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:28.491 region:rollup2
TAXES CAP AND TRADE THAT COST

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:30.226 region:rollup2
CONCRETE AND STUCCO PRICES TO GO

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:31.227 region:rollup2
UP NOW P. YOU SEE PUT SOLAR

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:32.228 region:rollup2
MANDATE ON NEW HOMES IT'S

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:33.096 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY EXPENSIVE JUST TO BUILD

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:37.100 region:rollup2
A HOUSE [inaudible]

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:38.134 region:rollup2
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE HURTING.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.170 region:rollup2
I MEAN WE JUST SAW AN ORANGE

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:42.705 region:rollup2
COUNTY SENATOR WAS REMOVED FROM

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:44.741 region:rollup2
OFFICE FOR A FOR A TAX VOTE --

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:46.109 region:rollup2
ALL THESE THINGS ADD UP ADD UP

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.243 region:rollup2
ADD UP TO THE COST OF LIVING IN

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.344 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:49.979 region:rollup2
AND AS I MENTIONED ONE I SPOKE

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:51.381 region:rollup2
TO THE SUPPORTERS JUST WHAT

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:53.016 region:rollup2
JUMPED OUT AT ME IS THE AND THE

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:54.484 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF REVENUE

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:55.985 region:rollup2
THAT'S INCREASED THE LOCALITY

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:56.786 region:rollup2
SINCE.

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:58.922 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TEN AND IT IN MY

01:05:56.786 --> 01:06:00.089 region:rollup2
OPINION.

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:01.624 region:rollup2
ITS OF A LOT OF TIMES IT'S A

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:02.625 region:rollup2
PRIOR IS NOT A REVENUE PROBLEM

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:04.461 region:rollup2
LIKE HEARING IN SACRAMENTO

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:06.162 region:rollup2
SOUGHT A REVENUE PROBLEM IT'S

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:08.798 region:rollup2
BEEN A SPENDING PROBLEM SO.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:10.633 region:rollup2
I I JUST THINK CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:12.836 region:rollup2
YOU NO NICKEL AND DIME TO DEATH

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.403 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW.

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:17.207 region:rollup2
WE GOT TO GIVE ME A BREAK AT

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:17.474 region:rollup2
SOME POINT.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:18.708 region:rollup2
IF I MAY.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.976 region:rollup2
MAY JUST.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:21.477 region:rollup2
SO I JUST THINK THAT THEY

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:23.780 region:rollup2
RESPECT YOUR POINT OF VIEW OF

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:25.415 region:rollup2
COURSE AND I I THINK THERE'S A

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.550 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A STATE

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:29.853 region:rollup2
LEGISLATOR.

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:31.821 region:rollup2
AND VOTING --

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:33.256 region:rollup2
TO OPPOSE --

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:35.592 region:rollup2
OR SUPPORT ANY REVENUE OR TAX

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:37.327 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:38.394 region:rollup2
VERSUS TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:41.931 region:rollup2
OF LOCAL [inaudible]

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:43.233 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. TO BE AND LOCAL

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:44.968 region:rollup2
VOTERS TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:46.369 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN FUTURES WHY CAN'T THEY

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:47.971 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT DECISION.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:49.305 region:rollup2
RIGHT I THINK THAT'S REALLY IT

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:51.641 region:rollup2
THERE IT COULD BECAUSE EVEN

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:53.710 region:rollup2
THOUGH IDEOLOGICALLY I KNOW WE

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.211 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT NOT EVER AGREE ON

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.946 region:rollup2
WHETHER.

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:59.182 region:rollup2
THE STATE OVERTAXED VERSES UNDER

01:06:56.946 --> 01:07:00.683 region:rollup2
RESOURCE THAT'S OKAY.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:02.652 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE YOU KNOW HAVE THE

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:03.486 region:rollup2
PARTIES AND WHY WE HAVE THE THAT

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:05.121 region:rollup2
THE DEBATES THE ELECTIONS IN THE

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:06.022 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:08.925 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:11.094 region:rollup2
IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE THAT I I FEEL

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:11.561 region:rollup2
LIKE THE PROPONENTS.

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:12.795 region:rollup2
AGAIN ARE BEING A BIT

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:16.666 region:rollup2
HYPOCRITICAL.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:17.267 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS IF GOVERNMENT IS TO

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.501 region:rollup2
TALK DOWN HERE FROM THE STATE

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:20.169 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.671 region:rollup2
WHILE YOU TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:23.339 region:rollup2
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:25.008 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THEIR OWN DESTINY OF

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:26.709 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS ONE IT.

01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:27.944 region:rollup2
THEN THE VOTERS WANT IT.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.945 region:rollup2
IF THEY DON'T WANT IT THEY DON'T

01:07:27.944 --> 01:07:30.847 region:rollup2
WANT YOUR COMMUNITY MIGHT SAY

01:07:28.945 --> 01:07:32.248 region:rollup2
YES.

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:33.850 region:rollup2
OR KNOW MY COMMUNITY MIGHT SAY

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:35.351 region:rollup2
YES OR NO.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:38.121 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL CONTROL IS BEEN SUCH

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:41.658 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF YOUR

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:44.060 region:rollup2
PARTY AND AND YOUR PHILOSOPHY

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:44.561 region:rollup2
AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.396 region:rollup2
IT'S KIND OF EASILY GETS

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:48.097 region:rollup2
IGNORED.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:50.233 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE VOTERS --

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.833 region:rollup2
IN YOUR CITY AN ORANGE GET WIT

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.101 region:rollup2
AND WHICH WOULD CITY BUT IN

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:53.436 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTYDON'T HAVE TO

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.970 region:rollup2
WORRY ABOUT.

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:57.006 region:rollup2
MY SACRAMENTO SALES TAX TO

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:59.542 region:rollup2
BUILD.

01:07:57.006 --> 01:08:00.944 region:rollup2
MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY.

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:03.112 region:rollup2
SO WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT TOOL

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:05.415 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM MY VOTERS [inaudible]

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:07.350 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE PART THAT

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:12.188 region:rollup2
I THINK IS [inaudible]

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:14.157 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT HERE.

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:15.325 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER OSAMA

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:17.093 region:rollup2
REALIZING CLARIFYING COMMENT.

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:18.461 region:rollup2
WHY IS IT?

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.029 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOUR

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:21.831 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WANTS TO DO SOMETHING WHY

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.799 region:rollup2
IS TWO THIRDS [inaudible]

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:25.335 region:rollup2
SITTARD.

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:27.170 region:rollup2
THE DOOR SHUT.

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:28.972 region:rollup2
ITS NOT A DOOR SHUT BUT IT SAID

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:31.474 region:rollup2
DOOR THAT IS --

01:08:28.972 --> 01:08:33.543 region:rollup2
AT LEAST HALFWAY CLOSE BECAUSE

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:34.911 region:rollup2
U. CAN THWART THEM AT THE WILL

01:08:33.543 --> 01:08:37.680 region:rollup2
OF A VERY STRONG MAJORITY I'M

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:39.048 region:rollup2
TELLING YOU IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.084 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN OUR MAJOR YOU SALES TAX

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:42.752 region:rollup2
NOT IN INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TAX GOD

01:08:41.084 --> 01:08:44.754 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:46.255 region:rollup2
SIXTY TWO OR 63%.

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:48.958 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE A FIVE QUOTE

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:51.027 region:rollup2
FAILURE UNDER THIS INITIATIVE I

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:51.661 region:rollup2
WOULD MAYBE WE DISAGREE BUT I

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:52.996 region:rollup2
WOULD ARGUE THAT SHOULDN'T BE A

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:54.430 region:rollup2
FAILURE.

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:56.866 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE A SIGNAL FORWARD

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:58.167 region:rollup2
TO THE VOTERS WANT TO INVEST IN.

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:59.268 region:rollup2
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THE

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.303 region:rollup2
VARIOUS WAYS THAT THERE MAYOR

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:01.904 region:rollup2
LAYS OUT IN THE TO BE HELD

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:03.139 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE IN MY HOPE NEXT

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.540 region:rollup2
ELECTION.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:06.342 region:rollup2
TO SPENDING THE MONEY EXACTLY

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.910 region:rollup2
HOW I PROMISED WHEN I WHEN I

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:09.045 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN FOR IT.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.980 region:rollup2
SO I DO THINK THAT SAID IT IF

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:16.185 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A DOOR SHUT.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:17.754 region:rollup2
IT'S A DOOR A BARELY AJAR.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.821 region:rollup2
CLINCHER FIGHT IT OUT ON DO THAT

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:19.422 region:rollup2
I MEAN THERE'S ALREADY A

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:21.257 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:09:19.422 --> 01:09:23.593 region:rollup2
--

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:26.095 region:rollup2
THE RULES THAT APPLY TO THE

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:27.230 region:rollup2
STATE AND AND IT'S A REVENUE OUR

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:28.765 region:rollup2
ABILITY --

01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:31.134 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW IT AS YOU KNOW IN

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:32.235 region:rollup2
THIS BUILDING TO RAISE THE TAXES

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:33.669 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS OF THE BODY AND A

01:09:32.235 --> 01:09:35.038 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR SIGNATURE THERE ISN'T

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.838 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THEIR HOUSE TO GO TO

01:09:35.038 --> 01:09:38.641 region:rollup2
THE BALLOT.

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:40.610 region:rollup2
A IF THIS BODY PUTS A HOUSING

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:42.378 region:rollup2
BOND APART BONTA  <u><c.green>SOMETHING</c></u>

01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:44.013 region:rollup2
ON THE BALLOT IT'S A MAJORITY

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:45.481 region:rollup2
VOTE OF THE STATE'S VOTERS OUT

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:47.850 region:rollup2
WHEN WE GO TO THE BALLOT ALREADY

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:49.419 region:rollup2
EVERY TAX EVERY SINGLE TAX A

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.319 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES TODAY

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:50.853 region:rollup2
HOUSE TO BE APPROVED BY THE

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.321 region:rollup2
VOTERS.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:55.691 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM THAT'S

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:56.826 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN.

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:58.161 region:rollup2
AND IT IS I THINK IT'S ALREADY

01:09:56.826 --> 01:10:00.263 region:rollup2
BEEN TOUCHED ON WORKSTREAM

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:02.398 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:03.666 region:rollup2
IT'S IT MAY BE A YES SIR ARE

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:06.035 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS OCCASIONALLY THAT

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:07.904 region:rollup2
THAT LEAVE OFFICE OFTENTIMES IF

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:09.038 region:rollup2
A LOCAL OUR ELECTED GET OUT OF

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:10.406 region:rollup2
STEP WITH THEIR ELECTORATE.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:12.308 region:rollup2
THERE QUICKLY REMOVED FROM

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:13.976 region:rollup2
OFFICE SO I MEAN WE'RE ALREADY

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:15.244 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE AND THIS HURDLE THE

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:17.013 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS IS REALLY GOING TO

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:19.015 region:rollup2
DEVASTATE CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:10:17.013 --> 01:10:21.284 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD AND ALSO MAKE THEM

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:23.286 region:rollup2
MORE ARE COMING UP TO SACRAMENTO

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:25.254 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR A FOR RESOURCES

01:10:23.286 --> 01:10:25.755 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN ABILITY TO

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:27.657 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:31.761 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:33.429 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:36.632 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM FORMAT ONE

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:37.633 region:rollup2
QUICK COMMENT AND THAT IS SO.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.801 region:rollup2
