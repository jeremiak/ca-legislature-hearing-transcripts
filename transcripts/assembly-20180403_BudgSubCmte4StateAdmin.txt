GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME BACK TO SUBCOMMITTEE FOUR ON STATE ADMINISTRATION. TODAY WE'LL DISCUSS THE BUDGETS OF THE PARTNER OF HOUSING EQUITY DEVELOPMENT. DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING THE CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER. ZERO HOW ENOUGH MEMBERS HERE FOR QUORUM MOST ARTISTS THAT IS A SUBCOMMITTEE. SO FOR SOMEONE WHO ITEM. NUMBER ONE. STATEWIDE HEALTH PACKAGE INTO THE BILL LANGUAGE. AND WHAT ACTUALLY UP WILL HOLD OFF ON THIS WHEN IT WAS TO CHOOSE INTERESTED. IN THIS WHEN WE START WITH. ALL OF US ARE THE ITEM NUMBER NINE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING. TO THE BILL LANGUAGE STATE SUPPLEMENTATION OF FOR COUNTY ASSESSORS PROGRAM. THE PROBLEM. IF WE GET OUT FASTER. THEY GOT THERE APPRECIATE IT. DIRKSEN SUPPORT OF FINANCE GOOD AFTERNOON. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES A FIVE MILLION APPROPRIATION EACH YEAR FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION FOR COUNTY ASSESSORS. PILOT PROGRAM. WHICH WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE THIS PILOT PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDING FOR COUNTY ASSESSORS. TO PAY SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR NEW AND ADDITIONAL STAFF OR FOR IT SYSTEMS. TO ASSIST ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES. NO SINGLE CATHOLIC RECEIVE MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OF FIFTEEN OR SO SENATE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE GRANT PROGRAM REQUIRES COUNTY MATCH ONE DOLLAR FOR EVERY TWO DOLLARS. IN GRANT FUNDS RECEIVED. A IN THE PROPOSED PILOT PROGRAM WE SEEK TO MEASURE THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT AS VALIDATED AGAINST PAY STAFFING NUMBERS. BASED TASK PERFORMED AND BASS COUNTY WIDEASSESSED VALUES. THIS IS SO MUCH OF THE OF. THE INITIAL STATE COUNTY SUCH AS PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS. APPROPRIATED BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE BUDGET ACT. BECAUSE I TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. LET ME ILLEGAL. O. WE GREW THE ADMINISTRATION THERE'S A REASON WHY ARGUMENT FOR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING A TWO ASSESSORS WE SUGGEST. THE LEGISLATURE IF THEY MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL CONSIDER A FEW CHANGES. TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. FIRST IS NARROWING THE FOCUS OF THE FUNDING OF THE ALWAYS OF THE FUNDING TO TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES OF THEN ASSESSOR'S OFFICES THIS WOULD HAVE A COUPLE OF ADVANTAGES. A ONE AS OPPOSED TO FOCUSING ARE BOTH ON STAFF AND TECHNOLOGY IS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOCUSING. JUST ON TECHNOLOGY WOULD ALLOW THE FUNDING TO BE SPREAD ACROSS MORE COUNTIES. IN ADDITION A TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES COULD HAVE A MORE LASTING IMPACT IN ASSESSOR'S OFFICES WHERE IS OF LIMITED TERM STAFF PRESUMABLY. A WOULD BE GONE AT THE END OF THE THREE YEAR PILOT. WE ALSO RECOMMEND. CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF THE COUNTY MATCH THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR PUT UP BY THE STATE THE COUNTY IS. A BE REQUIRED TO SUPPLY FIFTY CENTS. WE SUGGEST CHANGING IT SO THAT NOT TO FUND A TECHNOLOGY PROJECT OF THE COUNTY WOULD PAY A SHARE OF THE COST THAT'S. A PROPORTIONATE TO THE SHARE PROPERTY TAXES THEY RECEIVED IN THE COUNTY THE STATE WOULD PAY A SHARE THAT'S PROPORTIONATE. TO THE SHARE PROPERTY TAXES ARE SHE BY SCHOOLS AND IN DOING SO YOU WOULD A LINE. OF THE COSTS OF THE PROJECT PAID BY BOTH THE STATE THE COUNTY A BETTER WITH THE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF PROPERTY TAXES THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE. THANK YOU OR ANNOYED PAUSINI'S W. QUORUM PLEASE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS SUSAN COULD DESCEND. AND AT THE END OF THIS WEEK I WILL CELEBRATE MY THREE MONTHS WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT I'D LIKE TO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS LISA BATES I'M CURRENTLY THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GOING ON ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS IN THIS CURRENT RURAL. AS ECHO INSTEAD W. ACTOR FREE TO THE. FOR THEIR HOUSING POLICIES. DEVELOPMENT. OUR DIVISION. NOT GOING TO LEAD OFF THE DISCUSSION WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE BCP. FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS FACED A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING DUE TO HISTORICAL UNDER PRODUCTION OF ADEQUATE SUPPLY WE COMPARED TO DEMAND. WHILE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STATEWIDE HOUSING ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING NEEDED ANNUALLY TO HOUSE THE GROWING POPULATION OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. ONLY AN AVERAGE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ANNUALLY OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. BECAUSE OF THIS HISTORICAL UNDER PRODUCTION OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE NOW HOMELESS AND ON SHELTER. RENT COSTS ARE CONSUMING AN EVER LARGER PORTION OF INCOMES AND WELL INTENDED BUT BURDENSOME REGULATIONS CONTINUE TO INHIBIT THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HOUSING. IN RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE DEVELOPED A LEGISLATIVE HOUSING PACKAGE. A FIFTEEN BILLS THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LINE SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. TODAY EACH CD IS REQUESTING AUTHORITY FOR POSITIONS AND FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THIS HOUSINGS PACKAGE. PACIFIC KLAY EACH CD REQUESTS. STEAM MILLION DOLLARS AND EIGHTY ONE POSITIONS FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX POSITIONS ONGOING FOR STATE OPERATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HOUSING PACKAGE. EACH CITY ALSO REQUESTS FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS I'M GOING AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE. LL. YES THINGS ARE CHAIR OF WE THINK THAT THE OVERALL REQUESTS A STAFFING WESTERN A CD IS REASONABLE. IT'S IN LINE WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS ANNOUNCES MET WITH THE BILL'S OF THEY MOVED TO THE PROCESS AND ALSO ONLINE WITH STAFFING LEVELS ARE PASSED A BOND MEASURES. A WE DO OFFER A COUPLE COMMENTS WITH THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER FIRST IS OF THAT THE DIRECTION GIVEN TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE EXPENDITURE OF THE FIRST YEAR REVENUES UNDER S. B. TWO. FOR HOMELESS OF THE SERVICES. WAS. NOT VERY SPECIFIC UPDATE THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO UNDERTAKE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT WOULD SHAPE HOW THOSE FUNDS A WOULD BE USED ABOUT THE SUBCOMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO PROVIDE MORE FORMAL GUIDANCE THEIR TRAILER BILL OR SOME OTHER VEHICLE. ON HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT FUNDING SPENT. OH BY WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT HOW THESE. THE IMPLEMENTATION THESE BILLS MOVE FORWARD AND SOME OF THE OF PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE FUNDED WITH SOME OF THE NEW REVENUE STREAMS. AND. AND BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES THE BILL THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER A WITHHOLDING APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL STAFFING RAMP UPS IN NINETEEN TWENTY. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. UNTIL FUTURE BUDGET PROCESS HE'S TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO COME BACK AND HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND ALLOW FOR FURTHER OVERSIGHT. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OF THE HOUSING PACKAGE. FINANCE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I MAY INTERROGATIVE ON A FINANCE WE HAVE TWO SEPARATE COMMENTS ONE IS JUST IN REGARDS TO A TECHNICAL CHANGE TO PROVISIONALLY WHICH. WITH ONE ITEM RELATED TO THIS P. C. P. AND ONE RELATED TO THE VETERANS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PENSION BCP. IT'S A TECHNICAL LANGUAGE CHANGE THAT WE'VE SHARED WITH THE LA ON YOUR STAFF. AND THEN. BUT. ARE SECOND COMMENT IS REGARDS TO THE AYE LEOS AND CONCERNS ABOUT STAFFING FOR NEW PROGRAMS AND FUNDING SOURCES WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE CONCERNS WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE POSITIONS IN THE OUT YEARS. I'M BECAUSE WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO BUILD IN MULTI YEAR POSITIONS IN THIS CASE. I'M OUR PROPOSAL ALREADY REFLECTS A RAMPING UP OF POSITION AUTHORITY WHICH IS PHASED IN OVER TIME TO REFLECT A FEE. HIRING TIMELINE AND GIVEN THE INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE DEPARTMENT WE BELIEVE THE MULTI YEAR AUTHORITY IS NECESSARY TO ADEQUATELY PLAN FOR NEW POSITIONS AND PROVIDE FOR A SMOOTH ONBOARDING PROCESS. HER FREE CD CAN EXPLAIN HOW YOU. PLAN TO USE THE. S. B. TO FUNDING FOR THE FIRST YEAR. YEAH PREVENT TALK ABOUT THAT. THE AS AS YOU KNOW HALF THE FUNDS ARE SPENT BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS USES HALF FOR PLANNING. THE HOME WITH THIS USES I WANT TO LAY OUT CAN OF OUR PRINCIPLES THAT WE'VE THOUGHT THROUGH AND AND WHAT OUR PLAN OF ATTACK IS. SO DETERMINING HOW TO DISTRIBUTE IF YOU FUNDS DOES NEED FOR HOMELESSNESS WE CUT IT THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES. THAT FUNDS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED DIRECTLY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SHOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN DECIDING HOW TO USE THE FUNDS TO BEST SERVE THE HOMELESS NEEDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. FUNDS SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO AND THEY'RE NON COMPETITIVE PROCESS USING EQUITABLE ALLOCATION FORMULA. LW SHOULD INCLUDE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE QUICKLY DEPLOYED TO ASSIST HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AND SHOULD INCLUDE USES THAT ARE GAPS IN THE CURRENT AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING. AND THE DESIRE TO ALLOCATE THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF S. B. TO REVENUES AS QUICKLY AS THE SECOND QUARTER OF FUNDS BECOMES AVAILABLE. IN LOOKING INTO NOW IT IT WAS AND HOW WE HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT WE LOOK AT OUR CLOSEST ALLY MEANT TO ACHIEVING THIS PRINCIPLES. POSSIBLY BEING OUR BURJI SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM. BUT OUR SYSTEM IS THAT MANY CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO THAT PROGRAM ON WORKING WITH SUCCESSFUL INTO PROPERLY FILL THE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM AS I MENTIONED. THEREFORE WE WANT TO SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFY. WHAT HAVE BEEN THE TRADITIONAL RICH SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM USES? AND ACTIVITIES AND USE SB TO FUNDS FOR THE FOLLOWING ELVES WILL USE. RENTAL ASSISTANCE WHICH COULD INCLUDE RAPIDLY HOUSING WITH EXPANDED FLEXIBILITY BEYOND CURRENT PROGRAM PARAMETERS. OPERATING SUBSIDIES IN THE FORMER FIFTEEN YEAR CAPITALIZE OPERATING RESERVES IN NEW AND EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS TO DEEPLY TARGET THOSE UNITS TO CALIFORNIANS ASK TEXTING HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS WHAT THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECTS OF FUNDING INCREASING PERMITS WERE HOUSING RIGHT NOW. LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT ESTABLISH OR SUPPORT FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL THE POOL AVAILABLE LOCAL DOLLARS TO COMMIT RENTAL SUBSIDIES. TO PRIVATE LANDLORDS AND SUPPORTIVE AND FOR WILL HOUSING PROVIDERS. OPERATING SUPPORT FOR SHORT TERM EVER EMERGENCY HOUSING INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS NAVIGATION CENTERS. THAT PROVIDE TEMPORARY ROOM ABOARD WITH LIMITED BARRIERS TO ENTRY WELL CASE MANAGERS WORK TO CONNECT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WITH AND FAMILY'S INCOME PUBLIC BENEFITS HEALTH SERVICES SHELTER AND HOUSING. LANDLORD INCENTIVES SUCH AS SUBSIDIES FOR LANDLORDS WHILE WAITING FOR HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER APPROVAL AND RESERVES FOR UNEXPECTED VACANCIES. AND SYSTEM SUPPORT FOR COURTNEY TO ENTER SYSTEMS DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND SERVICE INTEGRATION. DATA AND WHO WITH MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS REPORTING AND HOMELESSNESS PLANNING. SO BUT TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WE WOULD DISTRIBUTE THESE FUNDS NON COMPETITIVELY THROUGH LOCAL CONTAINS OF CARE THEY RECEIVE MOST FEDERAL HOMELESSNESS FUNDING. WOULD MODIFY THE EGGS ARE EXISTING CALIFORNIA EST FORMULA TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS HOMELESS POINT TIME COUNT DATA PRINTER COST BURDEN AND POVERTY RATE. AND THESE WERE SAID TO BE FUNDS THEIR BLOCK GRANTED AND MUCH MORE PERMISSIVE AND USES THROUGH THE MENU OF ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES I REFERENCED. WHERE EACH CONTINUE OF CARE WILL DETERMINE HOW THEY BREAK DOWN THERE USES WITHIN THAT MENU OF OPTIONS? AND SINCE WE HAVE A PROXY TWENTY FIVE MILLION REMAINING CALIFORNIA EST FUNDING WOULD APPLY THESE PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES TO BOTH OUR REMAINING FUNDS THEIR AND OUR S. B. TO HOMELESS FUNDS AND PULL THEM INTO ONE NOTICE A FUNDING BILL BILL THE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE EASE. THE ADMINISTRATION FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND TO LEVERAGE BIGGER FUNDING. WE WOULD OFFER SEPARATE NO FOR. FOR FEDERAL YES HE FUNDS IN JUNE SINCE WE CANNOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL. WE EXPECT IT TO THE THAT THE SECOND QUARTER OF SB TO REVENUES TO IT WILL BE PERMITTED FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE BY THE END OF JULY. SORE CURRENT STATUTORY AUTHORITY WOULD ALLOW LIST PROPOSED DRAFT GUIDELINES OFFER THEM FOR THIRTY DAY PUBLIC COMMENT. PERIOD IN JUNE WITH A NO FOUR ON THE STREETS IN AUGUST WE COULD TURN AROUND THIS BLOCK GRANT FUNDS THAT SIXTY DAYS OF APPLICATION. AND THEN THE PLANNING GRANT SIDE AND A WEST OF THE OF THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE REVENUES ARE AS OUR PLAN FOR THOSE FUNDS TO BE DEPLOYED. US SO WE CAN KNOW HOW MUCH WILL BE AVAILABLE EACH AND EVERY DURING A LOCAL JURISDICTION BUT WE WILL BE ABLE BEGAN OFFERING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ON HOW THEY WOULD ACCESS PLANNING GRANTS IN THE LATTER HALF OF THIS YEAR'S. SO I SO I HAVE THE CURRENT ESG FUNDS GONE OUT. WILL THEY HAVE WE WERE WE WERE AWARDED. WE ORDERED SOME FUNDS IN PREVIOUS BUDGET YEARS AND WE HAD PLANNED TO CONTINUE THAT OVER COUPLE YEAR PERIOD. ARE WE TYPICALLY HAVE A LINE THAT WITH OUR FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVEN'T GOT HAVE GONE OUT SO FAR THIS YEAR'S HOW DOES NOT GIVE WITH OUR FEDERAL FUNDS WHO'VE ALREADY KIND OF IN A WEEK AND GET WAITING WAITING GAME THERE. SO. IN THIS CASE WE WOULD SEPARATE OUT THE CALIFORNIA SEA PROGRAM AND JUST. EYELINER POOL THAT'S BE TWO FOOT DOLLARS WITH THEM AS WELL. AND OUR EXPECTATION IS WE WILL GET OUR FEDERAL YES YOU FUNDS FROM HYDE. SO WHAT SOON AND BE ABLE TO OFFER THOSE FROM. HOW MUCH MONEY S. B. PULL THE GO OUT? WITH THAT IN TERMS OF SO ABOUT WE HAVE ABOUT. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU FUNDS ON THE FEDERAL AND FEDERALLY WE HAVE ABOUT I THINK ELEVEN OR TWELVE TWELVE MILLION. THE TWELVE NAY FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD GO OUT HAS ALWAYS HAPPENED ANNUALLY. IN VIEW ASSUMING WE GET THE FUNDS ARE HARD WHEN WE EXPECT TO AND THEN WE WOULD PULL THE REMAINING CALIFORNIA SECRETIVE WITH THESE NEW EXPANDED PROGRAM USES. COMBINED IT'S BEAUTIFUL IT'S IMPARTED PARTLY A PART OF OUR DECISION MAKING THERE IS. THE CALIFORNIA SEA FUNDS ARE A LOT MORE LIMITED IN WHAT THEY CAN DO. TYPICALLY IS THE OUTLOOK FOR THIS RAPID RE HOUSING MONEY THAT HAS PUT AND CHALLENGES OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THERE'S WE'RE TYING THOSE TO CUT THE FEDERAL PARAMETERS AND HOW MUCH RENT ASSISTANCE THEY CAN PROVIDE. AN ARCHIMEDES ARE RENTS IN THE COMPETITION ARE MAKING THREE FOR SO GREAT THAT DEFERRAL REAL LIMITATION AT SOME OF THE JURISDICTIONS BILL EXPAND THOSE FUNDS. TO THINK YOU GET BETTER UTILITY IF WE JUST EXPANDED WE FILL THE DAY WITH THESE EXPANDED PROGRAM USES AND FREE UP. SOME OF OF SOME OF THE. AVAILABLE KIND OF OPTIONS TO COMMUNITIES TO SILICON REFLECT THE ACTUAL NEEDS THERE WHAT IS THE CURRENT FIX HE READ A CD. LEARN YOUR VACANCIES. THE AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY VACANCY RATE FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN IS THIRTEEN PERCENT. BUT ACCOUNTING FOR THE UNFUNDED NO PLACE LIKE HOME POSITIONS THE RATE IS APPROXIMATELY NINE PERCENT. FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THROUGH JANUARY THE MONTHLY AVERAGE WAS SIXTEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT. BUT ACCOUNTING AGAIN FOR THOSE NO PLACE LIKE HOME POSITIONS THE RATE IS APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN PERCENT. SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN TO BRING ON BOARD IT WILL STAFF POSITIONS FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. OUR PLAN IS TO HIRE IN WAVES FIRST FOCUSING ON THE SP TWO POSITIONS. WE'VE DEVELOPED A PROJECT PLANNER WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF I'VE HAD. REFINING OUR PROJECT PLAN FOR MANAGING THE EFFORT AS ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECT FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND AYE WERE APPROACHING IT STRATEGICALLY SO THAT WERE PLANNING THAT THAT WILL ON BOARD POSITIONS AND PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT WILL SUPPORT. THE ONBOARDING ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT FIRST WAVE WOULD BE WHAT TIME PERIOD. AND WHAT IS FAR AS NUMBERS GO. THE FIRST WAVE I THINK THAT I HAD BETWEEN SP TWO AND AND IRVINE RATHER THE SP THREE POSITIONS AS APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE EIGHTY ONE POSITIONS REQUESTED IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. SO WE'D FIRST BEFORE KISSING ON THE OTHER HALF OF POSITIONS WITHIN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR. OKAY SO JUST BASICALLY TO WAVE THEN. YES ALTHOUGH I THINK THE NUANCES THAT THERE MAY BE A LEADER WAVE OF FOR S. B. THREE. I'VE HAD. THAT THE RECRUITMENT WOULD BEGIN WITHIN THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR. BUT WOULD BE CONCLUDED MOVING INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR MISTER. I THINK MISTER CHAIRPERSON ME. START ST. NOT JUST AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANKS TO A EIGHT CD AND EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WHO WORK TO TO PASS OUT LAST YEAR'S. HOUSING PACKAGE. IT WAS A BIG LEFT AND I'M GLAD WE ARE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND I WANTED JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU IN OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE STAFFING LEVEL THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PACKAGE. GETS IMPLEMENTED AS QUICKLY AND AS EFFECTIVELY AS WE NEED TWO SO UP LOOK FOR TO THAT CONVERSATION. MR HOMESTEAD I KNOW RECENTLY WORKED IN THE LEGISLATURE SO I THINK HE ANTICIPATED A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD. ABOUT HOW SOME THESE FUNDS MIGHT BE. MIGHT BE USED BUT. TOP LEVEL WHAT YOU JUST TOLD US ABOUT CHANGES THAT YOU WANT I PROPOSE TO ESG. ARM IS THAT. TUMMY THE PROCESS UNDER WHICH THOSE CHANGES WOULD HAVE YES SO WE WOULD. WE WOULD ISSUE WE WE TYPICALLY ALLOW FOR OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT ON OUR OUR OUR OUR GOD LET YOUR VISION STILL WE. ARE TIME LIMITS WOULD BE PREPARED TO. BEGIN THAT JUNE FIRST WOULD HAVE A THIRTY DAY COMMENT PERIOD AND WE FINALIZE THOSE GUIDELINES IN JULY. WE EXPECT THE SECOND QUARTER OF LOVE THAT'S BE TO FUNDS TO DETERMINE IF LOOKING TOWARDS OFFICE AT THE END OF JULY SO FOOLISH WITH LAUGHTER BY MID AUGUST WE PUT OUR NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY ON THE STREET WITH THAT REVISED. WITH THOSE REVISED IN FOR THE FINAL GUIDELINES THAT WE WOULD MEAN FINALIZING JULY AND WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IF THE CHANGES POTENTIALLY TSG OR IS THAT IS ALREADY PUBLIC. NO OKAY YOU'RE YOU'RE BREAKING IS THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY IT'S SO I THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. WOULD LOVE IF MAYBE WE CAN GET THAT IN WRITING SO THAT WE COULD START MULLING OVER IT AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT. VIC THE ONE PROGRAM THAT FUNDING FROM SPT COULD BE PLUGGED INTO WITH THE COURTS TO FUND IT S. YESTERDAY AND. WE ALL KNOW THAT YES SHE REALLY HAS NOT DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF ADDRESSING CHRONIC HOMELESS. ADDRESSES OF FOLKS WHO'VE RECENTLY COME HOMELESS. WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS WITH ADDRESSING SHORT TERM HOMELESSNESS AND IT SOUNDS TO ME. JUST BASED ON WHAT I HEARD THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING HARD ABOUT THAT. ABOUT THAT QUESTION ON. ONE QUESTION. TO YOU. DO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW ESG HAS BEEN WORKING AT LEAST IN ADDRESSING SHORT TERM HOMELESSNESS DO YOU HAVE. DATA THEIR WAYS FOR STATES TO TRACK THAT INFORMATION AROUND GRANT RECIPIENTS. DOES THAT INFORMATION EXIST YEAH I MEAN WE CERTAINLY WE GET REPORTS OBVIOUSLY. FROM FROM THE GRANTEES. THAT THE CURRENTLY HAVE RECEIVED THIS. I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE USES ARE OR MORE LIMITED RIGHT IT'S. YOU CAN YOU SOME MONEY FOR MERGING SHELTER. YOU CAN USE MONEY FOR LIKE RAPPER HOUSING ARE THE DATA WE GET IS MOSTLY MORE LIKE PERSON SERVED RATHER THAN REALLY GREAT OUTCOME DATA OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HAVE AN INTEREST IN. YOU KNOW GETTING AS BAD AS BEST DATA DRIVEN OUTCOME DATA WITH THESE FUNDS AS WE CAN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. AND I IMAGINE WE WILL HEAR IN PUBLIC ON THAT YOU KNOW PERCENT OF THE PUSH AND PULL AND THEN THAT THEIR SUPREME THING AND HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO BE REQUIRED OF THEM VERSUS. WHAT WE WOULD LOVE TO ASK FOR FOR DATA PROJECT PERSPECTIVE BUT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BUILD A TO THIS SOME EXPECTATION THAT WE SEE? ESPECIALLY SINCE IT FOR PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN PERSON THIS ND HOW LOOKOUT HE MADE ME USE THOSE FUNDS TO SAY OKAY IF YOU'RE. DECIDED YOU FUNDS A CERTAIN WAKING PLEASE IDENTIFY YOUR HOW MAYBE WE'RE GONNA SERVER WHAT HOW CAN YOU HOPE TO YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE BY THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY AN OUTCOME WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. I THINK YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. GATHER A LOT OF LOCAL THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL I PRESENT YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT OUR WHOLE ACCORDING TO FIND TO COUNSEL'S NEED A PRIORITY OF. WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEGUN TO LOOK INTO BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE A STATE LEVEL SYSTEM THAT WE WOULD LIKE IN TERMS OF THE CAPABLE YOU'RE GETTING AT. TO REALLY DO THE GREAT EVALUATION I THINK THAT'S NEED TO MAKE MORE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS. BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE I THINK THIS DIFFERENCE NEED OF SERVING FOLKS NOW AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR THE THE MENU OF THINGS. I THINK GET GOOD AT THAT BUT ALSO WITH THE AYE ON GETTING A CHRONICLE ASSISTANCE IN THIS LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT WE TALK ABOUT. YOU LOCAL HOUSING SUBSIDY APPLICABLE SUBSEA POOLS OR WHAT DOES ACTUALLY THAT LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDING THAT CAN BE USED TO AUGMENT OR SUPPLEMENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I THINK WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE. COMMUNITIES OMICS OF THOSE CHOICES BUT. BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO ADDRESS A WHOLE CONTINUUM OF ELICITED FROM FOR SHELTER DEL ON% TO PERMANENT POSITION CREATED YOUR ANSWER ON THAT AND AND CERTAINLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO COLLECT MORE DATA. SOONER THAN LATER IS AS HELPFUL. YOU MAY KNOW THAT I HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD. IT WOULD TO ASK EACH CD TO START COLLECTING LOCAL DATA SO THAT WE HAVE A BIGGER PICTURE OF OF EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR. FUNDS CAN BE BEST USED PUMP. A DIFFERENT QUESTION I HAD WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF WANTING TO GET MONIES OUT TO OUR LOCALITIES AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO GIVE THEM. FLEXIBILITY ANDADDRESSING THE CRISES THAT ARE HAPPENING ON THE STREETS OF OF CITIES AND COUNTIES. OF BUT I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN WANTING TO GET MONEY OUT. TO LOCALS TO BE USED AS A SEE FIT. VERSES WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONIES ARE WELL SPENT AND I'M WONDERING HOW DO YOU PLAN TO BALANCE THOSE NEEDS IF THEY'RE CITIES TO. ONE IT'S BEEN MONIES IN CERTAIN WAYS BETTER ONLY ADDRESSING PARTS OF THE ISSUE HOW THE BALANCE FLEXIBILITY WITH MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ACTUAL OUTCOME SAID THAT WORK FOR US. YEAH I MEAN I THINK I THINK OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA GO UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT EXPLORE SOME THESE QUESTIONS ON ACCOUNTABILITY LIKE HOW HOW MUCH CAN WE. DEMAND OF OF RECIPIENTS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GOING TO CUT MORE BLOCK GRANT MODEL. HOW FAR CAN WE PUSH ON SOME OF THOSE? SO I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TODAY RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WE WE ANTICIPATE THAT'S GOING TO BE A MAJOR MAJOR POINT OF KIND OF DISCUSSION AND AS WE DO WORKSHOPS ON THE DRAFT GUIDELINES ARE ENCRYPTED BACK FROM MULTIPLE LITTLE PARTIES. BUT I REST ASSURED IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE DONE A LOT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSION ABOUT ABOUT HOW DO WE HAVE THAT APPROPRIATE CAN ABILITY AND CAN GET THAT OUT OF PEACE. NOT TO SAY YOU KNOW WE DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S ONLY CERTAIN THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE I THINK SOME THE CRITICISM CRITICISM OBVIOUSLY IN THE PAST AS WE WERE MAYBE OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE AND HOW MUCH MONEY HAD TO BE SO UNCERTAIN THINGS. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE HEARD SOME OF THAT TOO. BUT. BUT CERTAINLY SURE THAT GOAL ON ACCOUNTABILITY ABSOLUTELY. YEAH WELL SAMIR DID NOT MENTION YOU KNOW. SOME OTHER THINGS WE HAVE BUT WE WE WE DO WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE FORCES ON THE CAPITAL SIDE FOR PERMITS FOR OF HOUSING. STILL ABLE TO BE DEPLOYED FROM THE DEPARTMENT SO WE TOOK THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL IN TERMS OF. THE FUNDS WE MAY BE ABLE TO STILL THE POINT FOR OUR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR HOPEFULLY WHEN I YOU KNOW POLITICAL FUNDS ARE UNLOCKED. AYE WE ALSO COURSE HAVE A BETTER NEEDS A HOUSING HOMES PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH IS UP THE VETERANS FOCUS BUT RIGHT FOR SUPPORT HOUSING SO WE WERE NOT MINDFUL THAT WE HAD A LOT OF POTENTIAL WRITTEN RESOURCES OUT THERE. ON THE CAPITAL SIDE WE THOUGHT HOW CAN WE SUPPORT THAT AND AUGMENT THAT HELP THOSE HAPPEN QUICKER BUT BE MINDFUL THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF CAPITAL IN THE STREET. AND. B. THREE PASSES EVEN MORE. GREAT FANDOM AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE PUTTING THE MONEY OUT IN WAVES. AND GET OUT SOME MONEY EARLY AND THEN WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL MONEY TO COME DOWN BEFORE. PUTTING THAT OUT HOW MUCH OF THE STATE USED THE FUNDING HAS ALREADY GONE OUT THIS YEAR. TO DATE AND THEN WILL GO OUT OF THE NEXT FEW MONTHS LIKE GIVE US A SENSE OF IT THIS YEAR'S AND WE HAVEN'T DONE A FOR THIS YEAR WE WOULD BE W. B. BLOCK MONTH BOOK IT WE WE WE DID ABOUT A THIRD OF THE FUNDING ALREADY OF OUR. STATE EST FUNNY SO INITIALLY WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX MILLION OFFER CC SO WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE MILLION MEETING IN THE REASON WHY WE ARE SO SORRY SINCE YOUR PROPERTY THIRTY FIVE WE WERE BUT AT THE SIGHT SENT TWENTY FIVE OUT OF TWENTY FIVE. STILL REMAINS FROM THAT AND THE REASON WHY THAT THIS IS IT ME IS IT EARLY ON OTHERS ALSO SHIFT FOR THOSE FOR THE FOR THOSE GRANTEES SO THEY NEED A KIND OF A RAMPING UP SO TO SPEAK. AND THAT WAS WHY WAS BETTER THIRD DOWN IN THE FIRST ROUND AND THEN THEY GET TO SPEECH WASN'T DO THE REMAINDER. THIS YEAR AND NOW IT DOES OF COURSE BEFORE S. B. TWO WITHIN THE NEXT IT'S ANOTHER THREE TO THE NEXT WE JUST THINK THEY'RE COMMITTING CONDOMS OF SKILL. BUT PUTTING THEM ALL TOGETHER FOR SOME EXPANDED USES COUNTER JUSTIN ERUPT. IN WHAT YEAR WAS ORIGINAL ESG DOLLARS. PUT OUT. BUT THE FIRST THE FIRST THE FIRST TOWARDS THAT WE MADE IRAQ LEAVE WERE IN TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN. RIGHT WITH THE BUT I'M SORRY PROCREATIVE. BUT WHAT WOULD YOUR THEIR PROGRAMS ORIGINALLY I CAN KINDA. OF THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN HOWEVER RESOURCES FOR STAFFING WERE NOT PROVIDED UNTIL A TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PCP WAS APPROVED. AND SO ON. THE INITIAL WORDS ARE MADE IN POLICE. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. FOR. SORRY TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FOR. FOREIGN NINE MILLION THAT FIRST HE SEES ME. FOUR NINE MILLION OF THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND SO TWENTY SIX MILLION TO OVER MEANS BETWEEN THE CAREER THE BUDGET YEAR. OKAY. STARTED RICHARD NORRIS UP IN ARE YOU IS THERE ANY PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY REGIONALLY. SO THAT. REGIONS OF THE STATE CAN COORDINATE HOW TO BEST ADDRESS HOMELESS CRISES AS OPPOSED TO CITY BY CITY OR COUNTY BY COUNTY. SURE. WELL WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO IT THROUGH TO THE EXISTING PROCESS WAS GO TO CONTINUES OF CARE IN ORDER FOR THE COTTONY BECAUSE THOSE THE ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDING AS WELL. UNTIL IT VARIES SOME COULD USE A CARE ARE MULTI COUNTY IN FACT NO ONE IS SEVEN COUNTIES UP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF STATE RIGHT THERE ARE SOME. THERE ARE SOME ITS IT. THERE ARE SOME COLLABORATIONS ON THAT LEVEL. THE NICE PART ABOUT THAT IS THAT'S A TYPICALLY WHERE CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE BOTH ENGAGED TO THE POST IS ONE OF THE SECURE THE COUNTY. RECEIVING THE FUNDING. BUT THEY DO VARY IN TERMS OF THEIR. TO YOUR GRAPHIC COVERAGE TO CERTAINLY. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING IN THE WAY WE'VE WITHOUT WHAT IF YOU DO THAT WOULD PRECLUDE. YOU KNOW IT MORE REGIONAL APPROACHES BUT THE FACTS ARE AND SOME WE CAN THINK ABOUT AS WE. GET TO THE FINAL CUT THE GUIDELINES MIGHT BE INTERESTING IT'S A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT YET BUT I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT. HOMELESSNESS DOESN'T ASSERTED STAY IN A CITY OR A COUNTY AND GETTING WE JUST TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER TO COURT A RESOURCES. BOB MIGHT MAKE SOME SENATE WE HAVE ALLOWED IN THE PASS. IF THE PREVIOUS DURATIONS FOR CONTINUE TO CARE TO CUT A JOIN UP THERE FUNDS IF THEY DECIDED TO DO SO I THINK WE ONLY HAD ONE. OR TWO XR TWO TWO TWO POTENTIAL DOT GREAT HE'S GOING UP TO DO THAT WE PROVIDED THAT OPTION WE HAVE PROVIDED THAT'S AN OPTION I M. TWO FINAL QUESTIONS SO. AT THIS MOMENT THE REALLY. THERE ANY STATE PROGRAMS TO EXIST THAT EXISTS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. THAT. WE CAN GET UP AND RUNNING QUICKLY AT THIS POINT MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT. WE'D WE CERTAINLY HAVE A NAY. ON THE NO POLITICAL PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT RATING AT THAT HAS A SPECIFIC TARGET ON CHRONICLE WITH THIS AND WRITE LOW THIS AUTUMN A PART OF THOSE THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN BOTTLED UP IN YEAH AND WE'RE PROBABLY. POTENTIAL YEAR AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO TAP THOSE TO AGE IT FOR ALMOST ALL OF OUR CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS YOU SCORED BETTER IF YOU TARGET THE MORE DEEPLY PRODUCT PUBLICIST SO IN THAT WAY WE. WE INCENTIVIZE THAT. BUT THOSE ARE ALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THINGS THIS IS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT WE ADMINISTER THAT'S KIND OF THE NON CAPITAL. OPTION FOR THE MOST PART GREAT AND THEN A FINAL QUESTION M.. THE SP TWO ESTIMATES FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RIGHT NOW ARE FAR LOWER THAN WHAT WE I HOPE FOR A NO. TO UNDER FIFTY MILLION OR MORE OF WHAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED GET FROM SP TWO COULD YOU OR COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY THE ESTIMATES ARE. HALF OF WHAT WE HAD THOUGHT WE VOTED ON LAST YEAR. AND SO THE ESTIMATES STILL REMAINS A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TOTAL FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR BUT BECAUSE OF THE. ALIGNMENT OF THE BUDGET YEAR AND THE CALENDAR YEAR I THINK THAT'S THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION YOU OKAY SO IT IS IT IS A COUNTER YOU. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. FOR OUR COLLEAGUES I THINK WE'LL KNOW THAT. NOT ONLY DO WITH A HOUSING CRISIS WE'VE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN THE CHALLENGES. THAT WE'VE HAD IS A STATE IS GETTING FUNDS GETTING ENOUGH FUNDS QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PROGRAMS AT WORK AND I THINK. WE. YOU KNOW WE'RE STARTING GET FUNDS OUT BUT BECAUSE NO PLACE LIKE HOME MONIES HAVE BEEN HELD UP THAT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT. WE HAVE A POT OF MONEY THAT WE NEED TO GET OUT FASTER. AND THAT WE HAVE THE ODYSSEY NEED TO WRAP IT UP AND THEN WHAT MR UPSET WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS. A WAS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THESE FUNDS ARE WELL USED AND AND I THINK ALL OF US ARE. ACUTELY. INTERESTED IN AND SEE THE OUTCOME OF WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION GETS WITHOUT HOW THE YEARS SHE PROGRAM IS CHANGED ARE BUT. A AGAIN APPRECIATE ALL THE THINKING THAT'S GONE INTO THIS AND AND MR HOMESTEAD WITH LOVE FOR. LOVE THAT INITIAL DESCRIPTION THAT YOU YOU READ TO US AT THE BEGINNING OF OF EXACTLY THE CURRENT THINKING OF OF HOW THOSE MONIES WILL BE USED. MR SHAPIRO. SO I JUST WANNA. SECOND THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS IT'S GONE INTO UP PUTTING TOGETHER SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY. AND. AT MY INTEREST IS. IN INCOME AND WE LOOK AT THIS HOMELESS ISSUE IS LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT COMMUNITIES I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET THERE. FRANKLY I'M BUT MAYBE IT'S AFTER A YEAR OF PUTTING THESE FUNDS OUT THERE WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING. MY OPINION LOCALLY IN MY REGION IS THAT. WE KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT'S NOT ANY MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THE YEAR BEFORE AND SO. ON I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT LIST OF THINGS THAT YOU WENT THROUGH THAT I TRADED TAKE NOTES AND IF YOU CAN PRETTY YOU KNOW PRESENT SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE FORMAL THAT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU. IN JUST A FOLLOW UP AND ON THE STREET YOU EARLIER TALKED ABOUT REPORTING THAT I DO BELIEVE IT'S. THE COUNTIES AND CITIES HAVE THE BEST. YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR JURISDICTIONS BUT. AT SOME POINT SOME REPORT BACK WAS WORKING NOT ONE NOT WORKING LOT OF MONEY'S GOING OUT AND WE NEVER GET. WHAT'S AFFECTED WAS NOT THAT'S WITH THE BIGGEST ISSUE NOT JUST HOMELESSNESS THE MONTHS A LOT OF PROGRAMS STATE PROGRAMS. I DON'T THINK I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH YOU INTENDED TO SPEAK TO YOUR WE PUT WITH HAVING YOUR OWN. YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE THINGS WITH MANY MORE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BEST PRACTICES THAT MAKE ME IS THAT WE WANT TO ALLOW FOR RIGHTS WE WANT READ AS AN OPTION OTHER COMMUNITIES TO REPLICATE IF THEY CAN'T. SO THERE REPORT BACK EVERY HIT FROM THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ON MONEY SPENT AND. WITH THE PLAN WITH THAT WE HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED ANY FUNDS OBVIOUSLY IN THIS MANNER YET SO WE WOULD OUTLINED IN RIGHTS GUIDELINES WITH EXPECT IT WOULD BE FOR. BUT THERE WILL BE GUIDELINES WITH THAT THERE. WE WOULD REVISE OUR CURRENT IF YOU GOT LET'S NOT PLY THEM TO FULFILL THESE POTS OF MONEY SO MAYBE CALL THE NEW SOMETHING NEW AND IN THE END BUT. BUT. BUT WE WOULD PUT OUT FOR THE FRAMEWORK AYE I LAID OUT YES PROGRAM THAT LETS AND FINALIZE GUIDELINES AS TO KEEP THE COMMITTEE EXPERT REVERSING WE EXPECT THAT. DESKTOP REPORT BACKS WE CAN LOOK AT IT AND HE WAS BEING EFFECTIVE. SO. HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPENT BY JULY? HOW WOULD YOU SAY WE SPEND IT WILL IT WILL GO UP BY THIS JULY WILL BE GOTTEN AUGUST WE WEGET THAT WE GET SO WE GET THAT WE GET QUARTERLY REPORTS THIRTY DAYS AFTER EACH QUARTER FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WE HAVE EVEN? GOTTEN OUR FIRST QUARTER'S WORTH OF OF OF FUNDS THAT WE HOPE THAT THAT BY THE END THIS MONTH WE WILL HAVE THAT. AND THEN WE GET THE SECOND QUARTERS AT THE END OF JULY WE PUT A NO FELT PUBLIC TO ACCEPT. SO THEY FOCUS ON A SPENDING ESG A WILL HAPPEN WITH PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WE WOULD AMEND OUR PROGRAM TO ACCOMMODATE ANYTHING THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET. I MEAN I WAS THAT'S PENDING LANGUAGE SO THAT'S WILL BE STRUCTURED OUR OUR PROCESS SO IT FOLLOWS THE PATH TO THE STATE BUDGET SO ANY FINALIZATION WE COULD INCORPORATE. A CHANGES THAT WERE MADE. I PRESIDENT THAT'S NOT NO. IF I CAN SPEAK TO THE TRAILER BILL WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED IS IN LINE WITH THE. THE MORE EXPANDED YES SHE FRAMEWORK THAT WAS SPOKEN ABOUT TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BECAUSE AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUES FROM S. B. TO. ASIDE MISTER I I JUST WANNA DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT OF THIS HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT THE ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE SAID. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ESTIMATED THE FEE WILL RAISE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION AND. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THAT'S NOT A CALENDAR YEAR. QUESTION IT'S A IT'S OF FISCAL YEAR QUESTIONS A CAN YOU ELABORATE BECAUSE IT LOOKS AS IF FOR ONLY RAISING HALF THE MONEY WHAT WE EXPECTED FOR THIS YEAR SHORT FIFTIES WERE FIRST COLLECTED ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND SO FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE DEPOSITED TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF THE TOTAL REVENUE. OF A FISCAL YEAR BASIS. I SEE OKAY THIS IS THIS I GOT IT OKAY SO YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BE ON TRACK WITH WHAT WE ALL EXPECTED OF A QUARTER OF THE TWO FIFTY. MILLION EVERY EVERY FISCAL YEAR BASED ON SB TWO FUNDS OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT CHANGED OKAY WE DON'T WE HAVE COLLECTED EVEN THE FIRST QUARTER'S REVENUE YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO. MICHAEL HAD OPEN UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARONREPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND WE TO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT AGE CITY HAS DONE ON THIS ISSUE. AYE WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE MONEY GOING THROUGH THE EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM. WE HAVE. HEARD BASICALLY THAT PRELIMINARY OF FINDINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR ON RAPIDLY HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT SHOWN GREAT SUCCESS FOR THIS INTERVENTION. IN FACT THREE QUARTERS OF OUR STATES HOMELESS POPULATION ARE SINGLE ADULTS. AND FOR THAT POPULATION RAPIDLY HOUSING HAS NOT PRUNED PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL GENERALLY THESE INDIVIDUALS AND UP HITTING A CLIFF AT SOME POINT WHERE THAT RENTAL ASSISTANCE ENDS AND THEIR. CYCLING BACK INTO HOMELESSNESS I'LL BE THINK THAT PUTTING THE MONEY INTO ESG WILL JUST FURTHER THE CYCLE AND OF NOT GO TOWARD PROVEN METHODS ON IT HAVE RAPIDLY HOUSING IS ACTUALLY NOT YET IN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. AND. WE DO THINK THAT THE MONEY SHOULD NOT GO BY FORMULA BUT SHOULD GO TO CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT APPLY AND SHOW THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. I USE THE MONEY ALLOCATED QUICKLY TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS QUICKLY. TOWARD THAT END WE DO THINK THAT THE HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WHICH AGE CITY IS ALSO IMPLEMENTING THIS YEAR. HAS A MORE TARGETED POPULATION TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE NATION'S CHRONIC HOMELESS POPULATION. IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE AREN'T TOO A MISTER CHOOSE QUESTION THERE AREN'T ANY SIGNIFICANT. OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE RIGHT NOW ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THOUGHT POPULATION SO WE DO THINK. WHILE IT IS EASIER TO IMPLEMENT. OF RAPID RE HOUSING WE DO THINK THAT IN GENERAL THIS PROGRAM THIS SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY SHOULD BE GOING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF POPULATIONS MOST VULNERABLE. AND OF WHO NEEDS RENTS LONGER TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE. BOB WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THE HOMELESS CONTINUUM'S OF CARE THAT GET ESG ARE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING ANY ALLOCATIONS OF FUNDING IN THE FUTURE SP TWO YEARS SO. S. B. TWO ALLOCATIONS FOR YEAR TWO AND BEYOND. WILL NOT GO TO HOMELESS CEO SEES THEY WILL GO TO CITIES AND COUNTIES AND FOR US THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE WANT TO SEE THOSE ENTITIES GETTING THE FIRST YEAR FUNDING SO THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. IN FUTURE YEARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT YOU. NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FIRSTLY WE REALLY WANT TO THANK AGE CD FOR OUR RECENT MEETING AND FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AROUND SP TWO IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDING. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO WORK OUT SOME OF OUR CONCERNS AS WELL AS WITH THE COMMITTEE. OUR CONCERNED SPECIFICALLY ARE THAT SUMMER MEDINA COUNTY HAS HISTORICALLY INVESTED A LOT OF THEIR OWN RESOURCES AND TO. REDUCING OUR HOMELESS POPULATION WHICH UNDER THIS FORMULA AND I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE EXPANDED FORMULA. BUT UNDER THE CURRENT FORMULA THE WOULD DISADVANTAGE US AND SO WE ARE HOPING TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ON THE ISSUE. WHEN YOU. HEY CHRIS MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA. WE WHERE IT'S OF ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS ON THE ORIGINAL SB TO BALANCE OF COURSE WANT TO SEE THESE FUNDS. USING THOSE MEANINGFUL WAY. AND AS SHARON MENTIONED. WE ARE UNDER ESG THE FUNDS WILL GO TO THE LOCAL CEO SEES AND. UNDER S. B. TO THE. ELIGIBLE OR WHO WILL BE RECEIVING THE FUNDS AT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM A MORE SUSTAINABLE PROGRAM CREATED. TO UTILIZE THE THE FUTURE FUNDS ARE MEN AND ALSO WOULD SUPPORT PUTTING THE FUNDS AND. AB SEVENTY FOUR AS MENTIONED THE HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA WHICH LOOKS MORE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AND. WOULD ACCOMPLISH A LOT MORE OF OUR GOALS. IF YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REYES FAMILY DATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY EIGHT OF CALIFORNIA'S COUNTIES THANK YOU AGAIN. WE AGREE STRONGLY WITH EACH CD'S GOALS AND GETTING THE MONEY OUT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. ON AND MAKING THEM DOLLARS AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE THIS IS THE FIRST WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT YES G. MODEL. SO WE'LL HAVE TO EVALUATE THAT BUT. WHAT WE WANT TO STRONGLY SAY IS THAT? THE FLEXIBILITY IS GOING TO BE THE KEY FOR COUNTIES AND CITIES TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING. OUTCOMES WE THINK ARE REASONABLE THING ON TASK FOR FOR THIS FUNDING BECAUSE ONE TIME FUNDING WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THE FUNDING GO AS FAR AS IT CAN HOW HOW CAN WE MAKE AN IMPACT WITH. THIS ONE TIME FUNDING FOR WHICH WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ON THIS ISSUE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EIGHT CITY FURTHER. THANK YOU. MERLIN CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. WE KNOW SADDAM OPEN. SMALLER NEXT AUTOMATION EVER TO HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FUTURE BILLING WHICH. OKAY SO ALL THE TOUGH THE DISCUSSION. AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS AB SEVENTY FOUR DIRECTS DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO REDEPLOY FEDERAL FUNDS RECEIVED FROM THE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND. TO ASSIST HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS. ACCORDINGLY THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES TO REDESIGN THE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. SPECIFICALLY EACH CD REQUESTS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY.

I HAVE A QUESTION. POSITION EASY STARTED TO RESIGN THE IN HDF PER A. B. SEVENTY FOUR. OUGHT NOT NOT COMPLETELY YET RIGHT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE POSITIONS OR THE THE STAFF CAPACITY BY WHICH TO DO THAT BUT WE HAVE POLICY HAS MATERNAL CONVERSATIONS ON A WHAT. YOU WANT SIX DEATHS ONBOARD HELENAE THINK WE'LL TAKE THEIR ESTIMATED TIMELINE. WERE YOU LOOKING AT I WOULD YOU ARE PLAN WOULD BE TO DEPLOY NO FOR NEXT SOMETIME NEXT YEAR. FIRST QUARTER IN THE NEXT YEAR. WHAT PART OF THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES THAT WE PUT SOMETHING IN OUR? HUD ALLOCATION PLAN THAT THIS YEAR SO WE WILL BE HAVING PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE SUMMER RELATIVE TO THE ALLOCATION PLAN REQUIREMENT AND THEN WE WILL BE WORKING ON GUIDELINES THROUGH THE REST OF THE YEAR WITH A NO FRIEND TO SPEEDED SOMETIME EARLY IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OKAY AND HOW LONG THE PROGRAM BEFORE IN FUTURE YEARS. SHOULD THE FEDERAL FUNDS DISAPPEAR. OUR OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE NO CURRENT FUNDS IDENTIFIED FOR THE. THANK YOU. CHIU. WHEN HE FIRST SAID START AGAIN WITH A THANK YOU TO. FOR SIGNING THIS BILL WHICH WHICH I'D AUTHORED I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND. ALSO THINK THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT JUST SPOKEN PUBLIC COMMENT FOR A FOR A PUSHING THIS VISION OF OF OF OF A BILL THAT FOCUSES ON HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. COUPLE QUESTIONS HOW MUCH DID WE GET. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FROM THE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND WOODY WAS A CITY ESTIMATING BURGUNDY RECEIVING. NECK AND OF THIS COMING YEAR AND NEXT YEAR IS TO GET A SENSE OF. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM. TWENTY ONE MILLION FOR THIS YEAR. UNCLEAR LIKE WITH THAT WOULD BE THE AMOUNT EVERY YEAR BUT. BUT I DON'T THINK SO LITTLE UNPREDICTABLE THESE DAYS OF THE FAT IS BUT BUT IF ALL GOES ON TRACK BASED ON PAST HISTORY YOU'RE THINKING IN THE TWENTIES TO THIRTIES IS AT. AN ESTIMATE. RIGHT WE DO NOT. AND I THINK FINANCE HAS SUCH A TEST. SIR ARE YOU WANTED FALL WITH THE NUMBERS THAT I HAD. THE FEDERAL GRANT AMOUNT WAS TEN POINT ONE MILLION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AT A FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND TWENTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION AND. FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY THREE POINT. TWENTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION. IT WAS THAT. THE REASON FOR THE INCREASES. AND FROM FROM YEAR TO YEAR WAS AT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD. I KNOW THIS PROGRAMS ACTUALLY NOT FUNDED ON THE DISCRETIONARY OVER THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND A DIRECTLY BY THE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC. AND SO THEIR DEPOSITS OF INCREASED GOTCHA REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ITS PROGRAM BY THE FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE STAFFING LEVEL YOU'LL BE ON TRACK TO DOING THAT. YES WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT OKAY. TOM WILL I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I READ THE ANALYSIS ON THIS AYE AYE OF COURSE ONE SEE THIS PROGRAM STEPPED UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN AND WHAT WAS PROPOSED. I WASN'T SURE IF THAT WAS GONNA BE THE CASE AND AND I'M WONDERING IF. IF EIGHT CD HAVE RECEIVED NEWER DOLLARS FROM SP TWO OR THE GENERAL FUND WOULD YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TO DO MORE. YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING THIS IS A LEVEL THAT THAT. E. OF STAFFING THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DOLLARS THAT WERE DISSIPATING WILL BE WELL SPENT. YEAH I DON'T THINK WHICH IS OUR TIMELINE IN WOULD BUILD OFFER NO FOR. BUT I THINK WE'VE ALSO CALCULATED. STAFFING NEEDS BASED ON SP TO FROM WHEN WE USE THE SG PROGRAMMERS ARE RESOURCE BUT I I'M NOT SURE THE RIBBING MUCH DIFFERENT SO IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT S. B. TWO DOLLARS. REVA ESTIMATED STAFFING NEEDS FOR SP TWO FUNDS AS A COMMON. OKAY SO STAFF THERE WOULD IT AFTER BE THERE DOVER IF THAT WAS DESIGNED TO BEFORE. OKAY AND THEN M. I PICKED IT UP A FULL QUESTION RELATED TO SOME OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT WE HEARD FROM SHALL REPORT. OF. GIVEN THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE CURRENT ESG PROGRAM. FOCUSED ON RAPIDLY HOUSING WHICH OBVIOUSLY ONLY FOCUSES ON A SUB. OF FOLKS ARE HOMELESS DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE EXPANSION THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS GOING TO CAPTURE. A THE THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION THAT REALLY HAS. THE HEART OF OF WHO WERE TRYING TO SOLVE FOR. YEAH I I ACTUALLY WOULDN'T SAY THIS IS THE IF YOU PROGRAM AT ALL RIGHT WE ARE USING SOME OF THAT ABOUT THE OTHER BASELINE FOR CONTINUITY FOR YOU KNOW RECIPIENTS IN THE SORT OF THINGS BUT TERMS THE EXPANDED USES THERE SO THERE SO MUCH BROADER. THAN THAT WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO BEFORE THAT I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE WHAT WE'RE DOING THE FOR EVEN AS YES TO EITHER SOME YES YOU LIKE PROVISIONS RIGHT YOU CAN STILL FUND NAVIGATION TYPESETTERS YOU COULD STILL DO A RAPPER HOUSING MODEL IF YOU DETERMINE THAT WAS BEST FOR YOUR. COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER USES RIGHT THAT THAT GO WELL BEYOND. WHAT WE CURRENTLY OR PREVIOUSLY WERE ABLE TO FUND AND SO WHILE WE USE THAT AS A WAY TO? MOVE FORWARD RIGHT IN TERMS OF HELPING TO HAVE CONTINUITY FOR OUR GRANTEES THEIR COMMUNITIES. I DON'T THINK IT'S PROBABLY ACTOR TO SIT THIS ESP MOVING FORWARD RIGHT THIS IS TAKING SOME OF THE THINGS FROM ESPN EXPANDING SIGNIFICANTLY BASED ON THE. THE DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE THERE THAT WE HEARD FROM AYE ADVOCATES AND AND THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL GOTTA GET YOU YOU REFER TO AN EXPANDED YESTERDAY SO I I'M HEARING YOU NOW SO ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT'S BROADER THAT ADDRESSES. THE MULTIPLICITY OF OF CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN WITH YEAH I MEANIF IT HURTS A GUY I DON'T KNOW. BUT CERTAINLY IT THAT WE HOPE IT WILL ALLOW TO GET AT SOME OF THOSE USES ALL OF US THAT WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION TO SOME DEGREE OF THE THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. INTO TO DETERMINE THEIR NEED. BUT. BUT WE DO THINK THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS THERE TO TO REACH MUCH DEEPER. ANSWER MUCH BROADER BROADER SWATH THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR. I'M. ASSUMING THIS PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH BY GENDER FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHEN WITH THE FIRST NO FOR. LIKELY GO OUT. I THINK WE ANTICIPATE THAT FIRST QUARTER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. GREAT THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME WITH POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE FIRST PHASE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. CHOI. WHAT WITH THE ALL HOME ALL AVAILABLE OR NEW FUNDING SOURCES FOR HOMELESS ARE? CAN YOU PROJECT AFTER CERTAIN NUMBER BE YOUR SET UP TO YOUR SO THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS. WITH BE UP CONTINUOUS OR REVENUE. HOW MUCH HOMELESSNESS? SITUATION OR BE SELF. I CAN'T. I'VE THIS IS ONE TIME FUNDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF S. B. TOO SO WE DON'T HAVE AN ONGOING SOURCE OBVIOUSLY JURISDICTION CONNECTED TO USE SOME OF THEIR. ONGOING SP TWO DOLLARS FOR HOMELESS USES OR OR OTHER USES AROUND FOR A HOUSING. BUT NO I CAN'T MAKE THAT DETERMINATION OBVIOUSLY GETTING AT SOME OF THE DATA PIECES THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS FUND WILL MAYBE PAINT A BETTER PICTURE CAN YOU SAY THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET OVER RICE HAS SUBSTANTIAL LA AMOUNT. TO. WAS SITUATION WOULD BE IMPROVED. CERTAINLY OUR HOPE IS THAT THE SITUATION BE PREVENT THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT MORE RESOURCES NEEDED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. PUBLIC THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A BOND ON THE BALLOT THIS YEAR. A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS PUTTING LOCAL BOND MEASURES ON THE BALLOT. PUTTING THEIR OWN DOLLARS AND SO YEAH THIS THIS ALONE WILL NOT WILL NOT SOLVE SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE DO HOPE THAT THE. THE REDESIGN WILL WILL HOPEFULLY LEVERAGE AND AUGMENT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE WORKING. GOING BACK TO S. B. TO WRAP IN YOU. IT WAS SUGGESTED TO EVENLY DIVIDED UP. HER FIRST HELPFUL WHEN YOU GO INTO. THE CITY CENTER COUNTY IS SO POOR THEY ARE. UP. THE LAND USE UPDATE YEAH SO THAT'LL AND AND THAT THAT NOSSO SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO HALF. ON THE OTHER ONE IS SO TO HELP BALK AT THE HOME AS SICK INDIVIDUAL SO INDIVIDUALS MEANS THAT THE W. TWO WEEK GAVE THE MONEY DIRECTLY TO THEM. OR OR OR PROGRAMS THAT THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES TO WOULD HAVE TO. COMPETE INTO YOU KNOW EARNED THAT. ON A QUICK BASIS PROPOSAL THAT WE'VE LAID OUT WE WE DON'T DO DO DIRECT DISTRIBUTION IT'S INDIVIDUALS WE PROVIDE THEM TO THE GOVERNOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DEVELOPERS ON THIS CASE. POTENTIALLY CONTINUES OF CARE WHICH ARE. COLLABORATIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE LIKE AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THE DETERMINATION ON WHAT PROGRAMS TO FUND WITH THIS KIND OF BLOCK GRANT FUNDS. SO. WE DON'T PROVIDE DIRECT ASSISTANCE INDIVIDUALS BUT. POTENTIALLY PROGRAMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. OKAY BUT THE. DAY HALF OF THE OF REVENUE THAT THOSE. YOU HAVE RECEIVED BUT DO YOU GOT BE A FIRST OUT THIS YEAR SO POINT QUARTERLY REVENUE WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REVENUE. BECAUSE OF THAT IT IS SENATE ON QUARTERLY BASIS ARE AS SAW. END OF MARCH WAS THE FIRST WE GET A VERY HIGH CONTROLLERS OFF IF THEY MONEY BECAUSE THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND WE EXPECT A THIRTY DAYS AFTER EACH QUARTER TO BE REMITTED LESLIE IT ANNOYS LATIN LIKE RIGHT NOW. BUT EVENTUALLY IT'LL BE TWENTY OF FIFTY EIGHT THE MILLION DOLLARS TORTILLA. ARE. WHAT DOT? WELL WELL THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT. FEED YOUR WILL ARE BASED UPON YOU ONLY HAVE HALF OF DHEA REVENUE IS SAID THOUGHT IT HAS TO BE HAVE. DOES IT HAVE TO BE REVISED. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION. WE WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF IT THE OTHER THE FIRST QUARTER'S REVENUE WHAT WHAT WOULD BE ON TRACK OF EACH QUARTER'S REVENUE WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR TWO YEAR IT IS A. FUNDING SOURCE THAT YOU ESTIMATED. DE THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SO AND OR YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE IT DOES THE JOB BASED BASED UPON SO FAR REVENUE WHAT THAT THIS IS ACCURATE FEATURE. NOW WOULD WE TOUCHED UPON ONE OF ALL WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST QUARTER'S REVENUES SO WE CAN'T DO ANY EXTRAPOLATION AT THIS TIME. SUCKING REPORT TO US BUT THE RHETORIC MAY REVISE MAY REVISE WHAT CAME BACK YEAH WE WOULD KNOW THE FIRST QUARTER'S REVENUE WILL. BE GREAT. FROM THERE YOU WOULD HAVE BAD IDEA HAS. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY.

THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. ENTER THE PUBLIC WHICH IS BIG ON THE SIDE OF. GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS OLD OPUS WILL HOLD OPEN. NEXT ITEM ISSUE NUMBER FIVE A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM WE DESIGN UPDATE. SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GIVE HER A BRIEF UPDATE ON THIS. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT REDESIGN EFFORTS. AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR ASKED US TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS RELATIVE TO THIS PROGRAM. AND WE'D LIKE TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE LAST SUMMER TO IT. DRESSED THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED INTERNALLY WITHIN OUR OWN DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THOSE RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS. HUGS ARE FEDERAL PARTNER AND AND YOU THE LEGISLATURE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING COLLABORATIVELY ON PROGRAM REDESIGN WITH A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CONSULTANTS. AND ASSOCIATIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS ROBUST PARTICIPATION FROM LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUR AGENCY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. JUST AS A REMINDER TO CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE REDESIGN HAVE BEEN TO ENSURE THAT EACH CD KIND OF FISH ONLY ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM IN A WAY. THAT EFFECTIVELY SERVES CALIFORNIA SMALL IN RULE JURISDICTIONS WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES. AND TO MODIFY THE PROGRAM DESIGN AND OPERATIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A VIABLE PROGRAM THAT MEETS FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. ASPART OF THE REDESIGN PROCESS WE'VE ESTABLISHED THREE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS AND OFFERING SOLUTIONS AND THREE PROGRAM AREAS INCREASING THE CBG EXPENDITURE RATE WHICH IS A BEEN AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY. DECREASING OUR UNSPENT PROGRAM INCOME WHICH HAD REQUIRES BE SPENT BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS PRIOR TO RECEIVING GRANT DOLLARS. AND STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. I ALSO IS PART OF THESE REDESIGN ACTIVITIES HAD A EACH CD EXCUSE ME HAS BEEN LOOKING INTERNALLY AT ITS OPERATIONAL. PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES AND MAKING GREAT STRIDES TO IMPROVE THESE INCLUDING THE CONSOLIDATION RECENTLY OF TWO SECTIONS INTO ONE. HAS A GRANT MANAGEMENT FUNCTION AND HAVING MORE STAFF. DIRECTLY DEDICATED TO THE CD BGP PROGRAM. THE INITIATION OF EXTENSIVE BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS FOR SEE TO BE OPERATE OPERATIONS UPDATES TO. MANY OF OUR PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES CONTINUE DATA CLEAN UP WEBSITE UPDATES AND IMPROVEMENTS AND INCREASED REPORTING TO HUD. THE REDESIGN WE THINK WILL ALLOW US TO TO ALSO ADDRESS WHAT WE RECEIVED A MONITORING WATER FROM HUD. RECENTLY THERE WAS A VISIT IN NOVEMBER AND THEY'VE SUBMITTED A LETTER TO US WITH A NUMBER OF FINDINGS AND CONCERNS. AND WE THINK THAT THOSE FINDINGS AND CONCERNS ARE IN LINE WITH THE WORK THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY WITH THE CVG PROGRAM. AND THOSE FINDINGS INCLUDE INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT REPORTING AN EXPENDITURE OF PROGRAM INCOME. FIVE TIMELY DISTRIBUTION OF OF FUNDS AND. THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO UPDATE. AND MEET VARIOUS FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR HUD IS THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR MONITORING OF GRANTEES. THESE CONCERNS WERE NOT UNEXPECTED I HAD SHARED THEIR CONCERNS DURING THE MONITORING VISIT WE'VE BEEN KEEPING THE STAKEHOLDERS SURPRISE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. AND IT WAS EXTENSIVELY DISCUSSED WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN MARCH. WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO A MEETING. THE INITIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE MONITORING LETTER INCLUDING SUBMITTING A RESPONSE TO HIDE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. AND DEVELOPING A MANAGEMENT PLAN TO ADDRESS THE THE FINDINGS OVER A FIFTEEN YEAR PERIOD. I AM I DO WANNA ACKNOWLEDGED ANYBODY FOOT WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN LEADING THE CBG REDESIGN PROCESS AND WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE I'M SET FORTH FOR US TO ACCOMPLISH IN SP ONE OH SIX. AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU THE REPORT THAT IS DUE ON JUNE THIRTIETH. HOW HE PROPOSED LIMIT THE CURRENT BACKLOG? EXCUSE ME ALLEY PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THE CURRENT BACKLOG. WELL PART OF THAT WILL BE THROUGH THE REDESIGN PROCESS WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO. ENCOURAGE THE EXPENDITURE OF PROGRAM INCOME. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT IS ON THE THE TABLE FOR THE THE CBG REDESIGN. WORKING GROUP. AND ALSO ONE MORE QUESTION. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE FEDERAL CONCERNS. PART OF THERE HAD MONITORING WATER IS ALSO PROPOSING THAT HAD WILL BE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO WE THINK THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF OUR EXISTING RESOURCES THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT HAD WILL BE PROVIDING. AND SOME SHORT TERM REDIRECTION OF SOME OF OUR STAFF WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE FINDINGS WITHIN THE FIFTEEN MONTH PERIOD. I'M A STAFFER DEDICATED THIS PROGRAM. ELEVEN OF. A QUESTION COMMITTEE. OF. COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING ON THIS BECAUSE. CBG HAS BEEN A BEEN OF A MOVING TARGET IN IN RECENT YEARS. OF FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT SORT OF THINGS ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT TO HELP SMALLER CITIES AND COUNTIES ACCESS FUNDS I KNOW. OUR COLLEAGUE AND THIS COMING YEAR IS NOT HERE BUT I'LL ASK A QUESTION HER STEAD I KNOW IT'S A QUESTION THAT COMES UP A LOT FOR MORE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS. THANKS AGAIN GINNY PUTTY FIGHT WITH THAT THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE EIGHT CD. OF WE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE SOME OF OUR ASSOCIATIONS AS PARTNERS IN THE REDESIGN EFFORT. WAS TO WORK WITH AND THROUGH THEM TO REALLY EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. KNOWING THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OURSELVES WITHIN EACH C. D.. TO HONOR AROUND REALLY REACH OUT ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE BUT I THINK THROUGH THE REDESIGN PROCESS AND ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH ASSOCIATIONS. SUCH AS LEAGUE OF CITIES AND THE. CALIFORNIA THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION RURAL COUNTIES WILL BE DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO DO TRAININGS THAT WORK ACTIVELY WITH THEIR SCHEDULES FOR TRAININGS AND INCORPORATE THEIR EXPERTISE AS WELL. GREAT AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION AND. I THINK YOU GAVE A GOOD SUMMARY OF FIVE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING TO RESPOND TO HUDSON LETTER. ARE THERE ANY ASPECTS OF WHAT HAD IT'S ASKING FOR THAT YOU THINK. ARE EITHER UNREASONABLE OR THINGS IT WILL JUST BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ADDRESS READY FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT. THE STATE IS IN A GOOD POSITION TO RESPOND WELL TO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING FOR. I THINK WE CAN GET TO A GOOD PLACE TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE HAD MONITORING UNDER ONE OF THOSE THE SIGNIFICANT THINGS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS CERTAINLY OUR EXPENDITURE RAINY. REDUCING THE PROGRAM INCOME THAT IS OUTSTANDING. AND THEN THE ON SITE MONITORING AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR WITH CALIFORNIA'S JUST THE GEOGRAPHY OF CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE I'M WORKING. WITH HUD IN TERMS OF A RISK BASED APPROACH TO HOW WE MIGHT CONSIDER ARE. IN PERSON AS WELL AS DESK MONITORING. GREAT UP I THINK IF YOU THINK TWO YEARS AGO I CARRIED A BILL. THAT EIGHT CITIES* TO DO TO HELP MAKE IT EASIER TO GET CBG FUNDS OUT AND IF THERE'S ANY ASSISTANCE YOU NEED PARTICULARLY AS WE'RE TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAPPEN TO BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AND I ALSO THINK WITH PARTY FOR ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS BEEN GRADING WORKING WITH THEM SO THEY CAN VERY MUCH VERY MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME. SOME. SORRY WITH DOCTOR CHOI. NOW. I'M CURIOUS. IN INDIA ON THE FUNDING ALLOCATION ARE. NOW WE ARE YOU RELYING UPON WHAT THE STATE CRITERIA WAR NAM FEDERAL QUOTE Y. TERRIO WHAT COMBINATION OF. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE TASKED TO DO IS TO COMPARE THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AGAINST WHAT THE STATE REGULATIONS ARE SO PART OF THE PROCESS WITH THE REDESIGN GROUP IS TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE REGULATIONS ARE CREATING ANY BARRIERS OR ONEROUS. SITUATIONS SUCH THAT WE SHOULD. MAKE IT EASIER FOR JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO REVIEWS ARE FUN SENSE OF THAT ANALYSIS. IS IS ONGOING AND WILL HAVE THAT AS PART OF OUR REPORT BACK TO YOU ON THE THIRTIETH SO THAT YOU CAN SEE. WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND CALIFORNIA'S REQUIREMENTS AND THEN WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS PROCESS WOULD BE TO TO MODIFY THE THE GUIDELINES GOING FORWARD? THE FULL IS EXAMPLES DO YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OF LA DOES THE POPULATION DEMOGRAPHIC UP BACKGROUND THOUGH OF THE POPULATION. O. WARM MARRIED BASIS OUT OF THE APPLICATION ITSELF FOR. WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE FACTORS IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ACCEPT APPLICATIONS AND RANK OUR APPLICATIONS FIRST AND FOREMOST LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING TO BE MOST EXPEDIENT TO GET THE MONIES. AWARDED AN EXPANDED BUT CERTAINLY THINGS ABOUT NEED AND CAPACITY ARE FACTORED INTO OUR ANALYSIS. OKAY IN THERE ARE. IT IS MEMBER AUTUMN FROM A STUDIO PARAVAI. THE ACTUAL OR. THE. PORTABLE ODOR. HOME OUR ASSISTANT BEATING. AMOUNT WAS SO. JUST A TOKEN AMOUNT THE IT WAS SO ALMOST SO YOU KNOW USE LISTA AMOUNT. BUT MOSTLY IT WAS ALL PROGRAM DRIVEN. DO YOU EMPHASIZE SO ON THE PROGRAM'S MORAL AURA HOSTING. A SUBSIDY. WELL THE CITY BG PROGRAM HAS A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAT. WEEKEND FUND AND THERE ARE CERTAIN PERCENTAGES THAT. HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT AYE I THINK THERE'S BEEN HISTORICALLY MAY BE. I CAN'T RECALL THE PERCENTAGE FOR HOUSING IN OUR THIRTY FIFTY PERCENT EIGHTY ONE PERCENT SERVE CURRENTLY THE CBG PROGRAM HAS A. A TARGET OF FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF THE FUNDS GOING TO SUPPORT HOUSING ACTIVITY. FIFTY ONE PERCENT TO HOSTING. WADE HAS GONE UP BY. OKAY THANK. IF YOU WANT THE PUBLIC WHICH IS BIG ON THE SIDE OF. KILL POST PUBLIC COMMENT AND WILL THIS ITEM OPEN THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM. ISSUE NUMBER SIX OTHER PROPOSALS. SO MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAD THIS ITEM INCLUDES FOUR DIFFERENT BC PEACE AND SO I'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO READ THE OVERVIEW STATEMENT FOR EACH OF THEM AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSSION.

WHICH AUTHORIZED EACH CITY TO RESTRUCTURE AND OR EXTEND THE TERM OF LOANS FROM NEWER PROGRAMS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LP OUR PROGRAM ENABLE THE CITY EACH CHARGE TRANSACTION FEES FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES AND DEPOSIT THOSE FEES INTO FUND NINE TWO NINE ELIMINATING THE NEED TO USE BOND PROCEEDS FROM FUND SEVEN FOURTEEN AND SPUN SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT.
