TWENTY NINETEEN MEETING OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE WE'RE GOING TO BE STARTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE AS SOON AS WE CAN FIND A REPUBLICAN MEMBER TO JOIN US. WE DO OF OFFICE WAITING SO IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE PLEASE TRY. TO COME UP AS SOON AS YOU CAN TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM THANK YOU OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND THEN VOTE AS SOON AS WE ARE ESTABLISH A QUORUM OUR FIRST BILL UP IS SB. ONE BY SENATOR ATKINS WELCOME SENATOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN -- COLLEAGUES. IT IS GOOD TO BE HERE TODAY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE COURTESY. ALLOWING ME TO START SESSION. OUR SESSION STARTS AT THREE SO I REALLY APPRECIATED [inaudible] I I'M HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT SB ONE THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKERS DEFENSE ACTIVE. TWENTY NINETEEN SB ONE IS SENSIBLE AND NECESSARY LEGISLATION IT MAKES FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARDS FOR OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER PROTECTION. ENFORCEABLE UNDER STATE LAW. WHERE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC ROLES THEM BACK? SINCE THE ADMINISTRATION IN DC TOOK OFFICE IT SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINED DECADES OF REGULATORY PROGRESS. DOZENS OF VITAL CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND ENDANGERED SPECIES STANDARDS HAVE BEEN WEAKENED OR ELIMINATED. THE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING OUR HEALTH WORKER SAFETY NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY THE INDUSTRY'S THEY'RE MEANT TO REGULATE. A COLD LOBBYIST NOW RUNS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND AN OIL LOBBYIST IS IN CHARGE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. AND THEY ARE SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER ENFORCING THE LAWS THAT ARE STILL ON THE BOOKS IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION OF PROPOSED A BUDGET BLUEPRINT. THAT WOULD REDUCE THE FUNDING OF THE US EPA TO A POINT WHERE THE AGENCY WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO MEANINGFULLY ENFORCE CLEAN AIR. AND CLEAN WATER LAWS. LIST GOES ON AND ON AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT -- THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PUTTING WORKERS AT RISK OSHA ENFORCEMENT IS DOWN SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN IN THE NUMBER OF OCEAN SPECTER'S HAS REACHED AN HISTORIC LOW. THE ADMINISTRATION IS SLASH THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS AND REDUCED OVERSIGHT OF WORKPLACE HAZARDS INSPECTIONS A WORKPLACE HE CONDITIONS HAVE FALLEN 50% IN TWO YEARS. AN INSPECTION OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS AND PESTICIDES HAVE FALLEN BY TWO THIRDS. MEANWHILE THERE'S STRONG EVIDENCE THAT WORKPLACE INCIDENTS AND FATALITIES HAVE INCREASED. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS WERE KILLED ON THE JOB. AND MORE THAN THREE MILLION WORKERS SUFFERED SERIOUS INJURY OR ILLNESS. THE NUMBER OF WORKPLACE INJURY IN FATALITY INVESTIGATIONS. TRIGGERED WHEN AN INJURY OR DEATH HAPPENS ON THE JOB ROSE DRAMATICALLY IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN SB ONE WOULD INSULATE CALIFORNIA FROM. BACKSLIDING ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES. IT'S SIMPLY PROVIDE SO WHERE EVER ACTIONS THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION MAY TAKE OR WHATEVER ACTIONS CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT. FOR YEARS AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW. THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER SAFE DRINKING WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES AND WORKER PROTECTION ACTS WERE ALL ADOPTED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THAT'S MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AGO. THIS BILL ENSURES WE KEEP THOSE COMMONSENSE PROTECTIONS. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION FROM THE BEGINNING TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS. WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS SINCE THE BILL WAS FIRST INTRODUCED INCLUDING SOME JUST LAST WEEK. LAST WEEK -- WE ADDED ADDITIONAL IT THIS IS THE FIFTH HEARING I BELIEVE FIVE BEEN AT THREE IN THE SENATE A AND TO THIS IS THE SECOND IN IN THIS HOUSE WE WILL GO THROUGH ONE MORE COMMITTEE AND APPROPRIATIONS. SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OVER TIME WE REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT AND WE CLARIFY THAT ALL AGENCIES MUST PROVIDE A THIRTY DAY PUBLIC NOTICE. AND COMMENT PERIOD PRIOR TO ADOPTING ANY FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARD. THE AMENDMENTS MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. THAT IF AN AGENCY ADOPT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME STANDARD. AS THE FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARD THE AGENCY MUST GO THROUGH THE FULL ADMINISTRATIVE -- PROCEDURE ACT PROCESS. WE ESTABLISHED A MORE OBJECTIVE HEALTH AND SCIENCE BASED STANDARD WE CLARIFIED THAT THE BILL DOES NOT AFFECT VOLUNTARY WATER AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD. WE'VE ADDRESS TROPHY HUNTING CONCERNS AND SUNSETS THESE PROVISIONS IN. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND NARROW THE LABOR PROVISIONS TO APPLY ONLY TO WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY. SO WHILE THESE AMENDMENTS DON'T REMOVE ALL OF THE OPPOSITION THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT STEP. AT ADDRESSING SEVERAL CONCERNS I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AS I TOLD ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. I BELIEVE EVERY STEP GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET US CLOSER TO AGREEMENT AND I WILL TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. AS LONG AS IT RESPECTS THE INTENT. OF WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO WERE SUPPORTED ON SB ONE BY A BROAD BASED. CROSS SECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND I HAVE A NUMBER OF FOLKS WITH ME -- AT YOUR DIRECTION MADAM CHAIR TO SPEAK I QUE POOL FROM IN OUR DC AND KIM TO FINO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE FOR HERE WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE COMMENTS AND IF YOU'LL LET THEM SPEAK THAT WOULD. IN LINE WITH YOUR RULES THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WHEN WE TYPICALLY GIVE TWO MINUTES PER SPEAKER. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KIM DELFINO AND I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THE THREAT TO CALIFORNIA'S AIR WATER WILDLIFE AND WORKER SAFETY IS AT THREAT RIGHT NOW IT IS A REAL THREAT -- CALIFORNIA IS A LOT TO LOSE -- IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SUCCESSFUL WITH MANY OF ITS PROPOSED ROLLBACKS AND HAS ALREADY DESCRIBED AS BE ONE IS A SIMPLE BILL. IT DIRECTS STATE AGENCIES TO REVIEW FEDERAL EFFORTS TO ROLLBACK ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND WORKER SAFETY STANDARDS AND UTILIZE THEIR EXISTING POWERS. TO TAKE ACTION TO ENSURE THAT STATE STANDARDS PROVIDE AT LEAST A BACKSTOP AGAINST ROLLBACKS. FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT -- WHICH HAS BEEN I THINK PROBABLY THE MOST CONTENTIOUS SECTION AT THIS POINT IN THE PROCESS ALL THE BILL DOES IS IT PROPOSES THAT IF AN ACTION WAS TAKEN TO WEAKEN SOME OF PROTECTIONS FOR A THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES UNDER THE FEDERAL ACT THAT IS NOT ALSO STATE LISTED. THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION JUST SIMPLY REVIEW WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD LIST THAT SPECIES OR NOT THEY COULD CHOOSE NOT TO THIS DOES NOT MANDATE AN OUTCOME. AND IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO PROTECT THAT FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES THAT'S NOT STATE LISTED THAT THEY THEN PUT IN PLACE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY THERE IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND FOR THESE REASONS AND FOR THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT TO LOSE WE WOULD PERJURE AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATE COOL I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. I'M I'M ALSO GOING TO FOCUS ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES SECTION OF THE BILL BECAUSE AS THE PROTON MENTION WE HAVE. BEEN WORKING WITH THE OPPONENTS -- LONG AND HARD AND I THINK HAVE RESOLVED MANY OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE BELL -- WITH REGARD TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES SECTION THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT AS THE REST OF THE BONE. WHICH IS TO GET THE STATE THE AUTHORITY TO ACT QUICKLY TO PROTECT STATE RESOURCES IN THE EVENT OF FEDERAL ROLE BOX. UNLIKE THE OTHER SECTIONS THIS IS NOT AN AREA OF THE LAW WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE STATE TO ISSUE PERMITS BECAUSE IT HAS IN THE AIR AND WATER CONTACTS. INSTEAD BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY ISSUE ENDANGERED SPECIES PERMITS. AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ROLLING BACK PROTECTIONS UNDER THOSE PERMITS AS THEY APPLY IN CALIFORNIA. SO THIS PART OF THE BILL ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TO RESPOND TO THOSE SPECIFIC ROLL BACKS. BY LISTING SPECIES IN THE STATE WHERE WARRANTED UNDER STATE LAW. ONE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS ARE REDUCED. IN BY ISSUING THEIR OWN PERMITS FOR SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT THE EXISTING LEVEL OF PROTECTION IS MAINTAINED. SO WITH THAT WEIRD YOUR SUPPORT PRESS THE ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOT ASK ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTS TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL TO PLEASE COME FORWARD AND JUST NAME ORGANIZATION YOU'RE REPRESENTING PLEASE.

THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL KATE CAPTION CHAIR MEMBERS ADAMANTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE AUTHOR WE HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE PROPONENTS. TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF CONCERNS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE. THAT COLLABORATIVE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE DO HAVE TWO REMAINING ISSUES AND THEY WERE FOCUSED -- BUT THEY WERE HIGHLIGHTED -- BY THE PROPONENTS [inaudible] ONE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SECTION IT'S THE ONE SECTION THAT WE HAVE NOT ADDRESSED -- TO CONCERNS THAT -- MY COUNTERPART JENNIFER PEER WILL HIGHLIGHT -- THE OTHER THAT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT -- WE DID HERE TODAY THAT THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED WE'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT FROM THE OPPONENTS PERSPECTIVE. THE THIRTY DAY COMMENT PERIOD IS AGAIN ON THE BOB PROPAGATION OF A LIST OF FEDERAL ROLL BACKS THE ACTUAL. PROPAGATING OF RULE MAKING THERE IS NO A. P. A. PROCESS CURRENTLY UNDER THE BILL OR UNDER THE NEW AMENDMENTS. THEREFORE OUR REMAINING ISSUE AGAIN IS WITH THE EXHAUSTION REQUIREMENT OR LACK THERE OF AGAIN WITHOUT AN EXHAUSTION REQUIREMENT OF THE APA ANY RULES PROMULGATED UNDER SB. ONE THE ONLY REMEDY AGAIN IS THROUGH LITIGATION. THAT CAN BE BROUGHT AT ANYTIME BY ANY PARTY WE ARE ASKING FOR EMERGENCY RULE MAKING UNDER THE APA IT'S A FIVE DAY NOTICE AND COMMENT PERIOD. WITH TEN DAY -- OIL REVIEW THAT PROVIDES AN EXHAUST REQUIREMENTS SUCH THAT YOU ARE THEN LIMITED TO THAT POOL OF ISSUES RAISED AND BY THE PARTIES THAT RAISE THEM -- WITH REGARD TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SECTION WE WOULD DISAGREE THAT IT'S A SIMPLE -- PART OF THE BILL AFFECTED WHEN THE MORE COMPLEX AREAS. SPECIFICALLY ARE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION INCLUDING THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND ALL INDUSTRY. WE PROPOSE AMENDMENTS THAT PRESERVE THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AND TO THE EXTENT SB ONE IN OUR VIEW EXPANDS CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SECTION WE'VE TAKEN ISSUE WITH THAT WE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF A DELISTING OR DOWN LISTING OF A FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES SUCH AT THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. CAN LOOK AT THAT DEALERS HERE DALLAS SCENE. AND ANALYZE WHETHER LISTED UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT CALIFORNIA'S VERSION OF THAT. AND WE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT PHIL WHAT WE CALL THE GAP WHICH IS DURING THAT INTERIM REVIEW PROCESS WE'VE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD PRESERVE. ALL OF THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS DURING THAT -- REVIEW PROCESS TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT DURING THE REVIEW THOSE SPECIES WOULD NOT BE PROTECTED. I WE'VE BEEN HEARING IN EACH COMMITTEE THAT WE'VE WENT TO THAT THIS IS NOT THE PURVIEW OF THEIR JURISDICTION BUT CANDIDLY WE'VE TRIED TO BRING THIS INTO THE PARKS AND WILDLIFE. IT DID NOT GO THERE AND SO WE ARE DAY LIGHTING THAT HERE BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE'S ONLY TWO POLICY COMMITTEES LEFT AND WE THINK IT'S A RIGHT ISSUE FOR ANY POLICY COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT SINCE IT DIDN'T GO TO PARKS WILDLIFE AND I'LL DEFER TO JENNIFER I'M NOT THANKS. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JENNIFER PAIR AND THE GENERAL MANAGER FOR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS WHICH ARE TWENTY SEVEN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT CONTRACT. FOR STATE WATER PROJECT WATER -- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME AMENDMENTS NONE OF THEM SO FAR HAVE ADDRESSED ARE -- CONCERNS AROUND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT I WOULD AGREE THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS SIMPLE AND I THINK THAT WE SUPPORT THAT SIMPLE INTENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY. THE BILL HAS THE RAMIFICATIONS THE STATE WATER PROJECT -- THAT ARE PRETTY DETRIMENTAL TO IT AND AND AND THE FOR THAT REASON WE ARE REMAIN OPPOSED. IT IS -- WOULD ESSENTIALLY FREEZE TEN YEAR OLD BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS IN PLACE. IT ALSO EXPANDS WHAT IS CURRENTLY SEIZE THE INTO THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF REGULATIONS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF TAKE. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY REGULATE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITY TO LIST SPECIES AND SO WE ARE TO REMAIN. CONFUSED AND CONCERNED ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE WOULD ACTUALLY TRANSLATE FEDERAL ESA INTO STATE. SEES -- WITHOUT ACTUALLY EXPANDING THE INTENT AND AND STATUE OF SEES THAT SELF. THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN SCIENCE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. HOW THE DELTA WORKS HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS TO BETTER -- IMPLEMENT OPERATIONS AND EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IS MEANT TO BE SCIENCE BASED DECISION MAKING. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN PROMOTING THAT'S WHY WE ARE COMMITTED TO A STANDALONE SEES A PERMIT FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH IS CURRENTLY ONGOING. IT'S WHY THE FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEING RE DONE TO INCORPORATE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. WE'RE ALSO APPLYING THE SAME SORT OF APPROACH TO THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY IF SB ONE WERE TO PASS IN ITS CURRENT FORM THE STATE WATER PROJECT WOULD HAVE ZERO FLEXIBILITY TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT AND WITHOUT THE STATE WATER PROJECTS PARTICIPATION. IT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT IN ITS CURRENT FORM TO ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED -- SO THESE ARE THE SPECIFIC REASONS WHY WE REMAIN OPPOSED ALL TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT BUT AGAIN I THINK THERE'S A BROADER IMPLICATIONS AROUND HOUSE HE SAID GETS EXPANDED AND AND CHANGED. BECAUSE OF THE INTEGRATION OF FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. OF INFORMATION APPLICATION AND HOW IT REGULATES ON THE FEDERAL SIDE -- WE WOULD BE WILLING TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION IF THAT PARALLEL TYPE AMENDMENTS WERE MADE AS THEY ARE IN THE WATER AND AIR SECTIONS WHICH ARE REALLY AT THE FEDERAL. REGULATION LEVEL VERSES THE SPECIFIC PERMIT TERM LEVEL WHICH IS WHERE THE ESA A SECTION CURRENTLY AS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL [inaudible] IF.

THANK YOU -- SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE ON THE BILL -- AND I GUESS MY QUESTION. TO THE MAT MANNA PRO TEMAS I'VE. KNOWN YOU FOR A LONG TIME AND NO NEED TO BE A SCIENCE. BELIEVING AGRICULTURAL LOVING. PERSON. SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO SOME OF THE THE OPPOSITION. AS IT RELATES TO SPECIFIC CULTURE AND AND SCIENCE AND THE EVOLUTION OF SUCH. I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN EGGMAN AND I I DO LIKE FOOD. AND WATER -- AYE AYE AYES IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BECAUSE I THINK SHE WILL BE BRIEFER THAN I IN TRYING TO EXPLAIN -- IN PARTICULAR I THINK IT IS THE SEIZE THE ISSUES -- AS IT RELATES TO THE SPECIES AND I WILL IF YOU DON'T MIND ASK YOU TO COMMENT. FROM A MORE TECHNICAL ASPECT BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY HAVE QUITE A FEW THINGS TO SAY TO EACH OTHER. ABOUT WHERE WE ARE -- IN THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU -- KATE POOL AGAIN FOR ENERGY SEE -- THE INTENT IS CERTAINLY NOT TO FREE SCIENCE IN PLACE WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL DOES INSTEAD IT SAYS. THAT ANY -- PERMIT THAT WOULD BE WRITTEN UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WOULD BE AT LEAST AS PROTECTIVE AS THE BASELINE PERMITS WHICH ARE THE EXISTING BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. ACCORDING TO THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE SO. IT WOULD EXPLICITLY INCORPORATE -- ANY NEW SIGNS THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BUT FRANKLY WE KNOW THAT THESE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT ARE BEING MODIFIED RIGHT NOW. ARE NOT GOING TO ADHERE TO THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE WE'VE SEEN DRAFTS. THERE HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEWS BY INDEPENDENT SCIENTISTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRETTY SKATING SO WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY. TO APPLY THE BEST SCIENCE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SPECIES THAT ARE HERE ARE PROTECTED. IT'S IN THE BILL -- WE SPECIFICALLY ADDED THAT FOR THE PURPOSES OUTLINED IN TERMS OF NOT LOCKING IN. I IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD THEN BE STUCK WITH SO ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF OF THE BILL IF YOU HAVE A COPY -- LINE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN THANK YOU. JUST JUST TO PICK UP ON WHAT YOU JUT SAID. SO YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED THOUGH THAT THE NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINION TO THINK IS FLAWED AND SO. YOUR ALREADY PROJECTING THAT DID THEY SHOULDN'T BE ADOPTED THOUGHT WOULD YOU JUST SAID. WELL THOSE NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED OUT THERE NOW DO AT THE END OF AUGUST -- WE HAVE SEEN SOME DROPS AN INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEWS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FLATTERING -- BUT FRANKLY WHAT I THINK DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT MATTERS UNDER THE BILL IS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THANKS AND IF THEY THINK THAT THOSE ARE NOT AS PROTECTIVE AS THE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS AND FRANKLY THE SPECIES ARE WORSE OFF. THAN THEY WERE WHEN THOSE PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WERE ISSUED SO IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST AS PROTECTIVE IF NOT MORE SO THAN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY UNDER THE UNDER THE BILL. TO WRITE A CEASE A PERMANENT. WHICH HAS MISSED PIERRE MENTIONED THEY'RE ALREADY DOING -- THAT WOULD MAINTAIN THOSE STANDARDS AND IMPROVE THE MORNING. HEY AT THE ONE ELSE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM. SOME MEMBER STONE. THANK YOU AND I KNOW THIS IS MOVING A LITTLE BIT AND WE'LL SEE THIS TOMORROW IN JUDICIARY BUT I HAVE BEEN. RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT. IS BEING CONSIDERED HERE AS WE KNOW. IT'S THE LEGISLATURE THE PASSES LAWS AND FOR US TO DELEGATE TO AN AGENCY THE ABILITY TO DO ITS RULE MAKING AND THOSE RULES PROPERLY PROMULGATED HAVE THE FULL FORCE AND EFFECT OF LAW. AND PROPERLY PROMULGATED IS THE ISSUE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT. WE ARE ENGAGED IN ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBILITY THAT ANY ROOM IN IT IS BEING DONE UNDER THIS. WILL SURVIVE ANY TEST IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD UNDERMINE ALL OF THE GOOD WORK HERE IF A RULE GETS PROMULGATED. TOO QUICKLY. OR WITHOUT APPROPRIATE PUBLIC INPUT AND PUBLIC REVIEW AND THEN THAT WHOLE SYSTEM GETS CALLED INTO QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE THOUGH THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. ADMINISTRATIVE LAYERS OR PROCEDURALLY SO THAT'S THAT IS A QUESTION THAT THAT IS RAISED I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH RESPECT I THINK WITH THAT WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE. BUT I WANT TO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS MAYBE MORE MY HALF TOMORROW THAN TODAY THAT WE REMAINING GAUGED. SO THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE LIVING OR DYING -- ON THE PROCESS AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FED'S ROLLING BACK THEIR RULES. CALIFORNIA'S RELIED ON THOSE RULES AND AND HAS ONLY FILLED IN WHERE NECESSARY WHERE THERE HAVE WHAT WE FEEL THEY'VE BEEN GAPS IN IN THE FEDERAL. THAT'S BEEN REALLY SHIP THAT'S WORK NOW IT'S NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF A LOT OF THE ROLL BACKS I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL IN HOW QUICKLY WE ACT. AND THE AREAS THAT WE JUMP INTO. WELL MAKE SURE THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THAT IN FILLING THE GAPS AS NECESSARY NOT JUST. REACTING FOR THE SAKE OF REACTING BUT THOUGHTFULLY PUTTING IN PLACE THE RULES THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE AND THESE ARE RULES THAT ARE GOING TO LAST FOR A LONG TIME. I MEAN I KNOW THIS SORT OF SUNSETS AND THERE'S THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THERE'S COULD WORRY ABOUT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. BUT IN MY VIEW IF WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT FOR THE BETTER AND WE ARE GOING TO BE LISTING SPECIES I DON'T SEE THAT WORK ALSO GET. ROLLED BACK BECAUSE WE WILL BE DOING THIS WORK UNDER A SET OF CALIFORNIA VALUES AND THE WAY THAT WE EXPECT TO BE MANAGING OUR OUR ENVIRONMENT SO I WAS THE LOOK AT THIS AS CALIFORNIA TAKING MORE CONTROL IN A PRODUCTIVE AN APPROPRIATE WAY. LONG TERM. AND SO I WORRY ABOUT THIS FEELING OF NEEDING TO REACT FOR THE SAKE OF REACTING AND WE ARE BETTER OFF SERVE BY REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE. MEETING OUR STANDARDS WHETHER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MEETS THE STANDARDS OR NOT. AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW I LOOK AT THIS BILL AND AND I HOPE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL IS A CONCEPT THAT WE WILL KEEP GOING REGARDLESS OF DESTRUCTION SAYING THERE'S VALUE IN THAT. SO CENTER YOU'VE YOU'VE TAKEN ON SOMETHING I NOT SURE IT'S A SIMPLE BILL MAYBE IF YOU READ IT LOOKS SIMPLE BUT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE ARE STEPPING IN. TO A TERRITORY THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY MANAGED IN A WAY WE FELT COMFORTABLE WITH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND NOW. LESS SO SHALL I SAY SO I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING A STAB AT THIS. THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I KNOW THAT -- THIS IS YOUR AREA OF EXPERTISE AND I'M SURE TOMORROW. WHEN WE'RE BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE I WOULD SAY -- IF FOR ONE I'VE NEVER SAID THIS WAS A SIMPLE BILL AND LIKE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HIS BYLINE IS IT'S A SIMPLE BILL -- THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE BILL I ITS IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WE IT I BELIEVE IT'S WHY WE WORK SO HARD OVER THE LAST FIVE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. TO ACTUALLY MAKE A LOT OF THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE WORKED WITH US ON OPPOSITION YOU CAN SEE WE'VE ACTUALLY AGREED UPON A LOT AND WE'VE COME TO AGREEMENT ON A NUMBER OF THINGS WE STILL HAVE SOME THINGS WE DON'T AGREE ON IN. TERMS OF THE CERTAINLY -- THE ACT AS IT RELATES TO RAGS I I AGREE WITH YOU A STATE AGENCY SHOULDN'T HAVE FULL REIGN AND FORCED TO MAKE CHANGES WITHOUT A PROPER REVIEW. TRANSPARENCY THAT'S WHY WE PUT INTO THE BILL TO ADOPT THE BASELINE FEDERAL STANDARD WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION. IF YOU ARE WITH YOUR ATTORNEY SAT ON IN AS THE CHAIR OF JUDICIARY HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS MORE CLEAR -- SO THAT IT MEETS THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IT DOESN'T GIVE OUR POWER AND AUTHORITY AWAY -- I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN YOUR RECOMMENDATION BUT THE INTENT IS VERY CLEAR AND WE'VE TRIED TO PUT IT. IN WRITING. THANK YOU BETTER PROTECT AND THE COMING WITH YOUR PROPONENT WHO SAID THIS IS CIVIL BELL I THOUGHT TRYING TO OVER SIMPLIFY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE FOR THIS AREA IS ACTUALLY VERY COMPLEX. AND IF WE GET IT WRONG THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE SO I WOULD NEVER SCRIBE TO WHAT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU ALWAYS SAYS. WHICH WE ALWAYS KNOW IS NEVER TRUE AS SOON AS HE SAYS THAT BUT WHEN IT. ONE OF ONE OF THE LIFE OF COURSE AND CENTER LIKE I DID NOT MENTION ANY LEGISLATORS NAME WHEN I SAID THAT. FOR THE RECORD. YEAH NO CHAIR WILL WE GET A CHANCE TO RESPOND I KNOW OKAY. UNLESS YOU ASK THE QUESTION BUT THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER FOR MARKS MANY ONE UP HERE. I'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TAKE ON A BIG ISUE IT'S ALWAYS -- YOU GET A LOT OF SUPPORT IN A LOT OF OPPOSITION AND IT TAKES A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS. AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CERTAINLY REARED ITS UGLY HEAD BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION BUT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT CALIFORNIA TOOK A LOOK AT WHAT OUR ROLE IT IS IN ALL OF THIS AND SO I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. AND THE AMOUNT OF AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND ARE WILLING TO DO TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND I I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE -- SOME MEMBER STONE THAT CERTAINLY LOOKING UP THE PROCESS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT BEST SCIENCE IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT REALLY IS SCIENCE DRIVEN -- AND THAT THERE'S A PROCESS THAT IS YOU KNOW TRANSPARENT IN STRAIGHTFORWARD. THAT WOULD THAT SHOWS. HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WILL MAKE THE DETERMINATION ABOUT ANY NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINION OR ANY PERMITS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE REFLECTIVE OF SCIENCE -- BUT I HAVE ALL THE ALL CONFIDENCE THAT AS YOU CONTINUE THROUGH THE NEXT COMMITTEES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO REALLY GET THIS TO THE BEST PLACE THAT CAN BE SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I HOPE THAT MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO AS WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING A PROGRESS. I'M UNTIL IT GETS BEFORE -- WITH THAT IF WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY WE'VE A MOTION AND A SECOND WE HAVE ROLL CALL PLEASE. I'M SORRY DID YOU WANT TO CLOSE I ALWAYS DO THAT BECAUSE I'M A NEW CHAIR AND I KEEP FORGETTING. I I WILL REPEAT MY COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH AYE.

JUST VERY BRIEFLY THIS BILL IS A VERY SMALL MODIFICATION SO FOR MOTELS FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY HOUSING TRANSIT ON A DAILY BASIS. SIMPLY WOULD ALLOW OF THE CITY OF LONG BEACH OTHER -- NON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES WHO MIGHT ACQUIRE THOSE MOTELS THE UP TO TO ADD A KITCHENETTE WOULD NOT INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE FOOTPRINT MORE THAN 10%.

FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ALREADY TEMPORARILY LIVING IN MOTELS THROUGHOUT MOTEL VOUCHER -- WIH -- MUCHO VOUCHER PROGRAMS IN SOME IN NUISANCE MOTELS ARE AN ARM BLIGHTED NEIGHBORHOODS -- IN LONG BEACH IN MANY CITIES TO OUR OUR STATE. HOW MANY OF THESE MOTELS ARE IDEAL OPPORTUNITIES TO CONVERT AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE SEQUEL DELAYS AND COST THE CAN BE UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS -- CAN MEET SUCH PROJECTS ON FEASIBLE -- WE'RE ASKING SIMPLY ASKING FOR A AND AN EXEMPTION -- IT'S A SIMPLE BILL AS A SPIN REFERENCED EARLIER -- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF OF KEEPING US BEFORE FIFTY VERY LIMITED TO MOTEL CONVERSIONS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT OR NEGLIGIBLE IMPACTS. TO TRAFFIC AIR QUALITY OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS HOWEVER I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE USING SUBJECTIVE WORDS LIKE SIGNIFICANT OR NEGLIGIBLE ACTUALLY OPENS UP THE CONVERSATION. TO POTENTIAL LITIGATION -- AN OBJECTIVE STANDARD AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED -- OF 10% IS MUCH MORE CLEARER -- AND IN ORDER FOR IT SB FOUR FIFTY TO FUNCTION AS A SEQUEL THAT BECAUSE AT THE THINK WHAT AND EXEMPTION WE REALLY NEEDED TO BE A STATUTORY EXEMPTION IN LAW. ON THAT MEANS THAT THE LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE FULLY EXEMPT FOR MOTEL CONVERSION PROJECTS WITHOUT REQUIRING THE LOCAL JURISDICTION TO DO ANY ADDITIONAL STUDIES. THE COMMISSION ALLEGED IN COURT AND FOR THAT I HOME AND WITH THAT OF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS FEAR SIMPLE BILL.

I DO THIS IS TO ME IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE AND I TYPICALLY DON'T SUPPORT SINGLE EXEMPTIONS OR ALL THESE CHANGES TO IT BECAUSE IT WAS SORT OF EASY TO POINT OUT IS A PROBLEM WHEN IT'S OFTEN NOT. IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS I'M NOT EVEN SURE THIS IS NECESSARY YET IF WE PUT. YET ANOTHER SEQUEL EXAMS ON THE BOOKS THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO MORE AND MORE AND MORE WHEN REALLY IT'S ABOUT. CONNECTING WITH YOUR COMMUNITY DOING THEWORK UP FRONT AND HAVING THE PUBLIC INVOLVED IN LAND USE DECISIONS AND BY PROVIDING SEQUEL EXCEPTION WE TAKE THE PUBLIC OUT SO I'M SORRY I JUST CANNOT SUPPORT BILL TODAY HIS NAME. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND WAVE A ROLL CALL. SO I'M SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. LIMIT LET ME JUST GENOCIDE IS A LARGE NUMBER STONE'S CONCERNS -- I TAKE YOUR POINT THE CAMEL'S NOSE POINT UNDER THE TENT -- I'M NOT SUPPORT OF OF ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS THIS IS REALLY SMALL. IT REQUIRES THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE -- FOR TYPICAL MOTEL ROOM WHICH IS FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FORTY SQUARE FEET THAT'S THE THAT'S THE LIMIT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EXPAND IT MORE THAN 10%. AND SO IT IS A CONSEQUENCE OF OF FOR EXAMPLE -- ALLOWING SECRET CHALLENGES TO BE MOUNTED FOR WHATEVER REASON -- YOU'RE GOING TO IMPEDE THE THE CITIES THAT ARE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS RELATIVELY SMALL MEASURE TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE -- PROVIDING A STABLE PLACE FOR THEM TO FOR EXAMPLE EVEN RECEIVE MAIL.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- FIRST LET ME START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND AND I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS A B. AND SEE THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. AND ALSO THAT WE DID NEGOTIATE WITH THE COMMITTEE A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL ITEMS IF YOU'D LIKE I CAN ARTICULATE THOSE. AND IF THERE'S ANY ISSUE WE CAN. YOU KNOW SOLVE IT -- INSTEAD OF A SUNSET PROVISION ADDING A SECTION IT STATES THAT THE EXPEDITED REVIEW PROCESS IN THE CHAPTER SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDS. OUR FULLY ALLOCATED AND DISTRIBUTED BY EACH CD. AND NUMBER TWO ADDING A TWO DAY NOTICE OF APPROVAL FILING REQUIREMENT AND A NEW SUBDIVISION THAT CLARIFIES THAT IF AN AGENCY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH ITS DUTY TO FILE IN TWO DAYS. THEN THE THIRTY DAYS FOR ANY ACTION PROCEEDINGS. START ON THE DATE OF THE FILING YES OKAY GREAT -- AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA FACES A DUAL CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS AND LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE RESULTING BURDENS FALL PARTICULARLY HARD ON PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS NEARLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE LIVING. WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS IN MONTEREY COUNTY ARE BY ANY ACCOUNT FOUND HOMELESSNESS GREW BY 23% BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TOTAL TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN INDIVIDUALS. IT'S THE HIGHEST IN TEN YEARS WE KNOW THAT HAVING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS LIVING AND SHELTERED RECYCLING IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS AND INCARCERATION IS COSTLY. AND THAT THE RESULTS -- IT RESULT IN NEEDLESS SUFFERING FOR THE HOMELESS AND THEIR FAMILIES THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT LAST FALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROPOSITION. TWO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE WHICH AUTHORIZES THE STATE ISSUED TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS TO CREATE TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS OF PERMANENT. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS. RESEARCH SHOWS SUCH HOUSING KEEPS PEOPLE INSIDE REDUCES ILLNESS AND SUFFERING AND LOWERS PUBLIC COSTS. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR HELPS FULFILL THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS BY CLARIFYING AND STREAMLINING THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES. LIKE THOSE THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME BONDS ARE FUNDING. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR UTILIZES THE STREAMLINING APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUPPORT HOUSING PROJECTS ENVISIONED IN LAST YEAR'S. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO AND A PLACES PROCESS TO NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROPOSITION TWO SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THE BILL EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND INCLUDES THAT. THAT. IT MAY BE A USE BY RIGHT IN ZONES WERE MULTI FAMILY AND MAKES USE ARE PERMITTED. CALIFORNIA VOTERS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WANT PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND ARE HOMELESS TO BE SHELTERED ND CARE. FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANY OTHER MEASURE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. SEVEN FORTY FOUR THANK YOU YOU HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I DO.

TONY BLAIR WITH THE A CALIFORNIA PARDON ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT AS WELL THANKS. AND AT THE GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OR WISHING TO VOICE ANY CONCERNS TO THE BILL. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CORD YES PERSON FROM THE JUST A COUNCIL IN LIGHT OF THE AMENDMENTS WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE FINE WORK IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF. OUR CONCERNS WERE ONLY FOCUS ON THE COURT IMPACTS OF THE EXPEDITED JUST REVIEW CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THESE -- EXPEDITED SEQUELS SORT THAT PROVISIONS REMOVED FROM THE BILL WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY -- IS NO LONGER WITHIN OUR PURVIEW THANKS. THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE. AARON RUBBER GONE WE HAVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION ALIGNING OUR COMMENTS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND IF THE EXPEDITED REVIEW WAS REMOVED WOULD BE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOING BACK NOW TO THE DYESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION. WE DO NOT YET HAVE EMOTIONAL THINK SOME OF THE BILL OKAY. AND A SECOND YEAH. AND THEN -- I I I SUPPORT THIS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS IN CALIFORNIA IS WE HAVE ENOUGH -- HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS CERTAINLY HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND CERTAINLY NOT ALWAYS BUT STRONG CONNECTION BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS -- MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION SEE IT RIGHT HERE IN OUR STREETS AND ONE OF THE FRUSTRATING THINGS THAT -- VOTERS HAVE SEEN IS THAT WHETHER IT'S IN LOS ANGELES PASSING A BOND MEASURE OR THIS MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. THAT WE'VE STEPPED UP AND PUT MINE THE BUDGET WE VOTED ON LAST WEEK WE PUT UNDER THE MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND WE HAVE PROJECTS THAT ARE. LANGUISHING IN THEY'LL BE READY IN TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS AND PEOPLE SEE TODAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S A CRISIS IT'S A MORAL CRISIS WE LOOK AT IT SO -- I AM IN SUPPORT THIS I I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH I DO WANT TO ASK JUST CLARIFY SO. THIS TAKES THAT THIS FOCUSES ON THE BY RIGHT ISSUE AND MAKES IT -- MINISTERIAL AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO GO THROUGH. LOVE THEM AND BODIES PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND COUNCILS SO THE THE WHOLE JUDICIAL REVIEW PIECES TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM THE BILL NOW SO IT'S JUST THIS. THE SAID IRAQ YEAH. SO THE HEAD OF THOSE TWO THINGS PLAY TOGETHER HOW WILL THAT WORK WITHOUT HAVING THE OTHER AB -- FIRST OF ALL WE EXPECT TO HAVE VERY LITTLE LITIGATION RELATED. TO APPROVALS UNDER THIS SECTION BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE BY RIGHT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY'LL BE VERY LITTLE LITIGATION BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS THERE'S AN EXPEDITED NOTICE READ -- PROVISION AND THEN LITIGATION HAS TO BE FILED EXPEDITIOUSLY. THE RECORDS IN THESE CASES THESE CASES PRETTY QUICKLY THROUGH THE COURTS. SO IT'S JUST NOT A GUARANTEE THEY'LL BE COMPLETED BY THE COURTS WHICH IS TAKEN OUT CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WELL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD HEARD ABOUT THE BILL I THINK IT'S STILL A REALLY. A POWERFUL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP YOU GET THESE VERY NEEDED -- PROJECTS - YOU KNOW EXPEDITED AND AND YOU KNOW IT BILTMORE QUICKLY SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WE HAVE A ROLL CALL. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK I NEED A LITTLE SIGN HERE THAT SAYS LET THEM? DO THEIR CLOTHES. THAT GOT INTO SOME KIND OF WEIRD HABIT OKAY. WITH THAT LET'S HAVE A ROLL CALL SB TWENTY TWO I MEAN I DON'T TWENTY TWO SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR BY CABALLERO THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I FLORA CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN IPHONE [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] LIMON [inaudible] MATHIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING MCCARTY HI MCCARTY I'M OUT TO TREAT. STONE. STONE I FOUR ONE I MEAN. FOR ZERO OKAY WERE FOUR ZERO WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTING SB TWENTY FIVE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING THIS INTO YOUR BILL BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE CHAIR -- FOR TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE BILL DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT IS GOING TO BE MADE IT TO YOUR BILL -- THE CHAIR DID AGREE WITH ME THAT -- AND OTHERS TO HOLD HEARINGS AND TO BRING IN THE STAKEHOLDERS. TO DISCUSS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE SECRET IMPACTS IN THE SOLUTION AND AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. SO I THE REASON I WANTED TO SPEAK TODAY IS THAT I I AM. THERE'S A THERE'S THIS MORAL IMPERATIVE AND I AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE -- THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THE COME WAIT TILL TOMORROW AND SOME JUST CAN'T. AND AS IT HAS BEEN ARTICULATED WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND DEPENDING ON WHAT REPORT YOU'RE READING. IT'S ANYWHERE BUT BETWEEN A HUNDRED AT BETWEEN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO THREE MILLION HOUSING UNITS SHORT SO WE COULD BUILD THEM. LIKE THIS TOMORROW WE'D HAVE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IT WOULD MOVE INTO THURMOND AND DESPERATELY NEED THAT -- THAT HOUSING AVAILABILITY AND IT IT MANIFESTS ITSELF NOT ONLY IN URBAN CENTERS BUT ALSO IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN MY OWN COMMUNITY WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN GARAGES THAT HAVE KIDS THAT ARE SLEEPING IN ADDICTS WHICH IS. TREMENDOUSLY AND SAFE -- WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN SHEDS THEY'RE LIVING IN THE CARS AND SO THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THERE A NEED -- FOR FOR HOUSING FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND THEY NEED TO BE AFFORDABLE AND IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY COUNTY AND CITY TO CLEAN UP TRASH AND TO SANITIZE. AREA WERE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE -- THEIR NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET AND WHERE THEY'RE LIVING OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE BEING DESTROYED BY IN THE PROCESS SO TWO YEARS AGO I I RAN A BILL -- THAT. BUT THAT WAS SEEKING TO TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID TWO YEARS AGO I SAY. WHEN THEY PASSED THEIR -- THEIR THEIR BUDGET BILL THEY CREATED WHAT ARE CALLED OPPORTUNITIES ON TWITTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE. UP PUBLIC DOLLARS AND HELP IMPROVE THEIR POOREST COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE OPPORTUNITY ZONES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THEY DESPERATELY NEED REVITALIZATION WHICH MEANS THEY NEED HOUSING AND THEY NEED JOBS. AND WHEN I DID MY ASSEMBLY BILL -- THIRTY THIRTY IT LOOKED AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SIX TRILLION DOLLARS IN PUBLIC IN A PRIVATE FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND AND THOSE ARE CAPITAL GAINS -- FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WORKFORCE HOUSING CREATE GOOD JOBS AND THAT BILL CREATED A SEQUEL EXEMPTION AND WE MAKE WE GOT IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE I PASSED -- I PASSED IT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY WITH FIFTY SIX VOTE AND IT ENDED UP BEING HELD UP IN THE SENATE IN APPROPRIATIONS -- AND AND AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE WHEN I CAME BACK IN THE SENATE THIS YEAR'S I TOOK A LOOK AT THAT AND I SAID YOU KNOW -- IT MADE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT IT WAS A HEAVY LIFT BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE WERE ASKED -- TO AGREED THAT WE WOULD WAIVE SEEK WELL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE AND SO THIS YEAR WHAT I DID IS I TOOK A MUCH SOFTER APPROACH AND I SAID YOU KNOW -- THAT THAT THE CRISIS HASN'T GOTTEN ANY BETTER WE'RE IN MUCH MORE DESPERATE. NEED OF HOUSING THAN WE WERE TWO YEARS AGO AND SO THE APPROACH. THAT I TOOK WAS TO WORK VERY DILIGENTLY WITH THE SENATE COMMITTEES THAT WE WENT THROUGH AND WE WE SB TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES THE HIGHEST IN IN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS PROJECTS MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL PLANS AND ZONING CODES. IT REQUIRES LEAD GOLD CERTIFICATION WAS ZERO NET EMISSIONS ZERO NET GHG. IT PROTECTS AGAINST GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT HAS TO BE DEDICATED TOWARDS HOUSING AND A MINIMUM OF 40% OF THOSE UNITS HAVE TO BE AFFORDABLE. AND IT REQUIRES A SKILLED AND TRAIN WORK WORK FORCE AND PREVAILING WAGE AND THERE'S NO SECRET EXEMPTION. PERIOD YOU HAVE TO BUILD AND AND GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS TO DETERMINE -- WHETHER YOU HAVE TO DO A SECRET DOCUMENT OR NOT DEPENDING ON ON YOUR GENERAL PLANTS IN YOUR ZONING CODES. IT JUST DOES ONE THING AND THAT ONE THING IS CREATE -- A EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS THAT HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS IF IT'S ECONOMICALLY FOR IS IT IF IT'S FEASIBLE TO DO THAT. DISTRESSED AS I SIT HERE TODAY IS THAT -- WE WORKED REALLY HARD AT TRYING TO CRAFT A SOLUTION THAT WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THAT ARE SAYING CAM CALIFORNIA ISN'T DOING ANYTHING. TO BUILD A HOUSING THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO STEP UP AND TO TELL -- IT PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE HEAR YOU WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEED IS AND WE'RE WILLING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND IF WE CAN GIVE. STADIUMS AND ARENAS. A AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR COMPLICATED PROJECTS REVIEWED WITHIN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS AND CERTAINLY WE CAN TAKE -- A THESE MIXED USE AND HOUSING PROJECTS AND AND GIVE THEM THE SAME KIND OF KIND OF RELIEF. IT IN IN TERMS OF A JUDICIAL JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ON THE ONE THAT HAND EYE HERE -- SEEK WAYS IN A PROBLEM IN IN THAT'S REALLY NOT IT IS THE SEQUEL EDUCATION ISN'T WHAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM WELL IF IT'S NOT CAUSING THE PROBLEM. THEN WE CERTAINLY WON'T SEE -- A LOT OF SECRET CASES FILED -- IT IN ITS THE CERTAINTY OF CONSTRUCTION IT'S PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A PROJECT STARTED. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT TO THE END WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME SO WHY IS THIS ALL IMPORTANT -- I CRAFTED SB TWENTY FIVE SO THAT THE CITIES IN THE COUNTY THAT NEED BILL HOUSING -- BITS AFFORDABLE TO THE WORKING FAMILIES CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON THE SIX TRILLION DOLLARS OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX IT'S AVAILABLE FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT. SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE STREETS AND THE SEWERS AND THE ELECTRICAL IN SOME OF OUR MOST CHALLENGING NEIGHBORHOODS SO THAT WE CAN BUILD HOUSING PARKS AND RECREATION CENTERS. IMPROVE LIVING CONDITION IN OUR POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY SO WE COULD START CHAU STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS. THAT ARE FACING RISING RENTS AND THAT OVERCROWDING IN APARTMENTS IN GARAGES IN ATTICS. CHILDREN AND SENIORS WHO ARE HOMELESS THAT THEIR NUMBER ONE CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED IT IS SOMETHING THAT WERE -- TAKING SERIOUSLY AND THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO BUILD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT -- THAT THAT REALLY DOESN'T -- DOESN'T TRAMPLE ON ON ANYONE'S RIGHTS OR ON ON THE SEEK SEEK WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS IN THE FIRST PLACE SO -- WHAT WHAT SB TWENTY FIVE IS? IS FOCUSED ON IS CREATING SOLUTIONS BY USING THE SAME TOOLS THAT WE'VE USED IN THE PAST AND SO NOT EVERYTHING CAN WAIT TILL TOMORROW. DID I MENTION THAT THERE SIX TRILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL GAINS TAX -- PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT WOULD HELP US TO HOUSE ARE WORKING FAMILIES WE OWE IT TO THEM AND THE TAX CREDIT ENDS IN SIX YEARS AND AS YOU NOW IF YOU START TO DEVELOP A PROJECT RIGHT NOW. AND BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN START CONSTRUCTION WITHIN SIX YEARS -- I'VE GOT A BROKE AT BRIDGE IN BROOKLYN THAT I CAN SELL YOU -- THE REASON THIS IS SO TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT IS WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO INVEST MONEY IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER STATES SO I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND HAVE THE SAME CONVERSATION IN JANUARY -- BUT I AM I AM I AM BEGGING YOU -- TO TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND TO SAY -- IS IT A BURDEN ON OUR COURT SYSTEM IS IT A BURDEN ON ON ANYONE TO HAVE AN EXPEDITED REVIEW IF WE CAN GET -- THE RESOURCES IN AND AND MY ANSWER IS IS -- UNEQUIVOCALLY NO I THINK THE COURTS ARE CAPABLE OF HANDLING HOW AT HANDLING THESE KINDS OF ISSUES AND QUITE FRANKLY WE THIS LEGISLATURE ALL THE TIME SETS PRIORITIES FROM THE FOR IT FOR THE COURT -- AND IF IT REQUIRES MORE RESOURCES WE ALSO CONTROL THE POCKET BOOK AND SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT'S WHAT SO WHEN I THINK THE CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO VENT A LITTLE BIT TODAY -- YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MY MY EXASPERATION AT AND HAVING TO GO BACK AND TELL CONSTITUENTS IN MY COMMUNITY THAT -- THAT I'M WORKING REALLY HARD BUT THAT WE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYTHING DONE -- QUICKLY AND AND FRANKLY I THINK THIS WAS IN EASIER PILL TO SWALLOW THAN AT AB THIRTY THIRTY BUT BANK AYE NOPE -- OTHERS WOULD WOULD DISAGREE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT MY BILL TODAY. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A WITNESS WITH YOU I DO TO SPEAK TWO MINUTES PLEASE SHARE HOLLY FOR MANY ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA I ALWAYS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- AND IT'S AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR TO AN OPTIMISTIC MADAM CHAIR THAT WE CAN HAVE A GROUP AS A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION HOPEFULLY BETWEEN NOW AND AND JANUARY. OF THE FOLKS THAT OF ALL GIVEN FEEDBACK THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS BUT I THINK REALLY EVERYBODY IN THE SAME ROOM TO DISCUSS. YOU KNOW THE CONCERNS A LOT OF US HAVE THAT SEQUENCE BECOME A TOOL IN A DETERRENT -- TO PROJECTS BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF LITIGATION VERSES ITS INTENDED PURPOSE WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT IN WAYS THAT WE CAN WITHOUT CREATING NEW EXEMPTIONS WITHOUT NEW WAVERS FROM C. CLUB MADE TO MAKE THAT TOOL. LESS OF A DETERRENT AND SOMETHING THAT REALLY CAN HELP KEEP THESE PROJECTS PROGRESS IN A TIMELY FASHION SO AGAIN WE'RE REALLY OPTIMISTIC TO WORK WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M OVER THE INTERIM AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME UP WITH A VIABLE SOLUTION TO MAYBE ONE BILL INSTEAD OF SIX OR SEVEN BILLS -- THAT REALLY CAN GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS HABITAT AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OF THE LITIGATION THAT HAS SURROUNDED SEEK OVER THE LAST DECADE THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU AND I'M A BIG FAN OF HABITAT I COME FROM A CITY. THAT HAS MORE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY PROJECTS AND THE REST OF THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COMBINED I AM CURIOUS HOW MANY PROJECTS HABITAT HAS BUILT THAT THIS BILL WOULD HAVE MAY HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON HOW MANY PROJECTS HAVE YOU HAD THAT HAD LITIGATION THAT TOOK MORE THAN TWO AND SEVENTY DAYS -- TO BE HEARD. AND WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE THAT HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO LITIGATION BUT WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL THAT HAVE BEEN DETERRED FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL. LITIGATION THAT COULD COME AT IT AS BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION OF BECAUSE OF THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO HAVING ONE OF THE STREAMLINING WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR YOU TO GO FORWARD EVEN WITH THE THREAT OF LITIGATION THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE MOVED FORWARD IF IT IF IT IF IT HAD A HAD THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY -- THE GUARANTEE OF BEING HEARD IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH HAT IT MADE THE DIFFERENCE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY WAY TO TELL THE ONE IN REDWOOD CITY SPECIFICALLY WAS IT SETTLED IN SIXTEEN MONTHS -- IN A LOT OF THAT WAS IT THE PRESSURE -- ON TO THE LEAD AGAIN AND THAT BUT THAT SAME POTENTIAL LITIGATION ACROSS THE STREET FROM ANOTHER NON HABITAT DEVELOPMENT THE TURF THAT PROJECT FOR MOVING FORWARD TO THE I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL BECAUSE EVERY CIRCUMSTANCES YOU KNOW WAS VERY DIFFERENT. DEPENDING ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BECAME A DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT AND HABITAT IS A BRAND THAT NOT EVERYONE LIKES TO CO. SO HABITAT THOUGH THEY FOR THE YOU KNOW HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SUED. A LOT OF OUR PROJECTS HAVE NOT BEEN SUBJECT TO THE LITIGATION THE PAST AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN SMALLER BUT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING A LOT OF OUR PROJECTS ARE NOW HIGHER DENSITY PROJECTS THAN TRADITIONALLY HABITAT I THINK IN YOUR DISTRICT HAVE BEEN ONE HAVE FAMILY ONE HOME AT A TIME. BUT WE HAVE SOME OF OUR URBAN AFFILIATES THAT ARE NOW STARTING TO BUILD UP TO A HUNDRED AND AN A PLUS I'M UNITS TOGETHER SO I DON'T THINK THAT NEW MODEL OF HABITAT HAS NECESSARILY BEEN TESTED BECAUSE IT'S NEW AND IT'S EVOLVING. OKAY THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS ACTUALLY WALKER WITH NASA MEN ON BEHALF OF THE MODERATE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT.

WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIFFANY YANG OF THE CALIFORNIA BY RELIGIOUS ALLIANCE OR SAY HOW -- WELL WE REALLY APPRECIATE OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT THE BILL YOU MUST RESPECTFULLY CONTINUE TO REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMEND AT THIS TIME. CENTER ALRP ARE RAISING A NUMBER CONCERNS WHICH WE HAVE DETAILS AND A LIST OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AUTHORS OFFICE WE OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT HOUSING AND IT WILL DEVELOPMENT BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY. FIRST OF YOU KNOW. THIS BILL WOULD APPLY NOT ONLY TO THE AYE OURS BUT ALSO TO NAG JACKSON MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS. AND EXEMPTS PROJECTS THIS IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S A REALIZATION THAT MOST THESE HOUSING PROJECTS ARE NOT ONLY SUBJECT TO YARDS BUT TO OTHER KINDS OF VIRAL REVIEW. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT REDUCING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FOR PROJECT THAT REALLY DO LESS OF A REVIEW AND HAVE LESS PUBLIC PROCESS. SECOND WE HAVE CONCERNS OF THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO A WIDE VARIETY PROJECTS NOT JUST HOUSING. AS YOU MIGHT KNOW -- THIS BILL APPLY TO PROJECTS WHAT ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AS WAS MENTIONED. AND OTHER THINGS LIKE ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS AND OTHER TEN OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES. SO AS A RESULT WE ARE REALLY CONCERNED THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS COULD BE -- NOT COMMUNITY SERVING AND THEY MAY EVEN CAUSE UNINTENTIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER KINDS OF HARMS A REALLY EXCELLENT DISPLACEMENT THESE KINDS OF COMMUNITIES SO -- YOU KNOW FOR US IT'S REALLY MAKE BIG THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMITTEES HAVE THE KINDS OF PROTECTIONS AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED -- AND WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE THIS BILL AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW WILL REALLY GET TO THE HEART OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS.

TO COMMENT ABSOLUTELY MADAM CHAIR PERSON -- THE CENTER I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- AND IT'S IT'S KIND OF SAD TO SEE IT BECOME A TO YOUR BILL -- I SEE A LOT A NEW BE ISM HAPPENING. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE THESE THINGS HAPPEN -- I SAW A HABITAT PROJECTS AND ACTUALLY NUMEROUS HABITAT PROJECTS IN MY CITIES. GET BLOCKED. BY PRETTY MUCH EVERY COURT MEANS NECESSARY BECAUSE OF NAY BE ISM -- I THINK LOOKING AT THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND GETTING THE LOCAL CONTROL INVOLVES REALLY HELPS -- IT'S SAD TO SEE THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE AS YOU STATED EARLIER. YOU KNOW WE WE CAN JUST LOOK. A FOOT YOU BLOCKS FROM HERE AND SEE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO WITHIN A MATTER OF YEARS. WITH THE STADIUM AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND YET WE SEE THIS WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING AND WE SEE THIS WHEN IT COMES THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND YET WE SEE THE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR STATE COMPLETELY FALLING APART AND THE SAME CRITICS THAT WANT TO BRING EVERYBODY. INTO CALIFORNIA AND MAKE CALIFORNIA SANCTUARY AND EVERYTHING ELSE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE BLOCKING THE ABILITY. TO REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAVE CALIFORNIA. HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE. THE SHINY. CITY ON THE HILL. THAT COULD BE AND THAT IT DESERVES TO BE -- DELIC FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS NEXT YEAR. PLEASE USE ME AS AN ALLY -- I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING GET DONE I WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA BE WHAT CALIFORNIA COULD BE. CAN I WANT TO SHARE INFRASTRUCTURE COME BACK. IN THIS BLOCKING OF ANYTHING TO DO TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS. THIS IS SICKENING TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE A DISADVANTAGE AREA I HAVE POOR COMMUNITIES SOME OF THE POOREST IN THE ENTIRE STATE. SOME WHO STILL DON'T EVEN HAVE WATER. AND YET. ANYTHING WE DO. UNDER THIS DOWN HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO TRY TO MOVE THE BALL TO SPEED THINGS UP GETS BLOCKED. OVER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. I WANT TO SEE JUSTICE FOR OUR PEOPLE. WHO ARE STOP WITHOUT THAT DON'T HAVE WATER WHO DON'T HAVE HOMES WHO DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THEM. AND IT'S REALLY EASY FOR PEOPLE SAID THEIR IVORY TOWERS. THE LECTURE US ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND COMMUNITIES THAT THEY DON'T LIVE IN. SO THANK YOU AND I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH. ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO COMMENT. SO I WANT -- SAY THAT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION I SOMEONE WHO DOES REPRESENT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IN HER DISTRICT CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN THEM UP CLOSE -- AND FEEL THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS WITHIN THEM AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF OF THE LOT THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LACK OF GOOD JOBS IN THOSE. AREAS -- AND I'M ALSO IN A DISTRICT THAT'S VERY HEAVILY IMPACTED BY. TO RECALL THE SEQUEL WARS ARE USING SEQUEL AS A TOOL ARE REPRESENTING EAST HOLLYWOOD WHICH IS BOTH AN OPPORTUNITIES OWN AT AN AREA THAT AS BEEN SUBJECT TO CIVIL LAWSUITS OVER. NOT ONLY ITS OWN NEIGHBORHOOD PLAN BUT OVER A MULTITUDE OF PROJECTS -- GOING FROM MARKET RATE HOUSING -- TO COMMERCIAL PROJECTS SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY UP HERE. HAS SYMPATHY WITH TRYING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRYING TO ATTRACT JOBS. I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S THE CASE OF THE LEGISLATURE IS DONE NOTHING WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING A WERE ALL ABOUT TO VOTE ON IT WE ALL VOTED LAST WEEK ON MILLION HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE SEEN A MULTITUDE OF HOUSING BILLS I MYSELF HAVE SEVERAL HOUSING BILLS. WE'VE HAD A OF PROBABLY AS MANY HOUSING BILLS IS ALMOST ANY OTHER TOPIC I'M IN THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS -- BUT THE REASON THAT I ASK FOR THIS BILL TO ME MADE A TO YOUR BILLS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO THE BILL THAT I'M NOT SURE WE'RE READY. TO REALLY MAKE SO THOSE SORT OF IN TRYING TO INTO LAW ONE IS THAT ITS SEQUEL THAT'S BLOCKING THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS IN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS -- IN OUR LOWER INCOME CENSUS TRACKS THAT ANYTIME A PROJECTS -- PROPOSE WHETHER IT'S A CLEAN JOBS PROJECT OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IT'S IMMEDIATELY THE SUBJECT OF A SEQUEL LAWSUIT. IS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN OR SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE DATA SHOWS THAT THAT'S THE CASE IN THE MAJORITY OF PROJECTS. ALSO A KIND OF DOUBLING DOWN ON THE TAX INCENTIVES FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND THINKING THAT THIS WILL HELP US COMPETE AGAINST OTHER STATES I'M ALSO NOT SURE THAT THAT'S REALLY THE CASE GIVEN THAT OTHER STATES. HAVE FOR INSTANCE WE KERN FIRE MENTAL LAWS THEY HAVE CHEAPER LAND THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE ALSO WORKING AGAINST CALIFORNIA IN SOME CASES WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE INVESTMENTS. NOT TO MENTION A CHEAPER COST OF LIVING FOR EMPLOYEES OF COMPANIES THERE'S A WHOLE SLATE OF THINGS THAT FIGURE INTO A COMPANIES DECISION OF WHETHER GOING TO MOVE TO TEXAS. I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND UNTIL WE'VE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES FOR INSTANCE AT THAT. A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY SEQUEL -- STREAMLINING IS GOING TO REALLY HELP THAT SCALE I THINK IT'S HARD TO REALLY MAKE THAT ARGUMENT THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- THE BILL IS NOT JUST ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S ALSO ABOUT -- OTHER TYPES OF BUSINESSES -- AND YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN FROM SEQUEL LAWSUITS YEAH BUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE SOMETHING BUT A LOT OF TIMES EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS AND AS SOMEONE MENTION. SEQUEL ALREADY HAS PRIORITY IN A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS IN LOS ANGELES THERE ARE SEE FOR JUDGES AND THAT'S ALL THE HERE IN THOSE CASES DO CAN TEND TO BE HER QUICKLY. BUT WHEN WE HAD A PROJECT IN MY DISTRICT THAT WAS HELD UP FOR FOR FIVE YEARS AND OF IN ITS BUILDING IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF STREAMLINING. IT WAS BECAUSE THE CASE WAS HEARD QUICKLY BUT THE JUDGE SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN CORRECTING THE WAY THE APPROVALS HADN'T GIVEN AN ISSUE TO STAY AND THIS BILL WOULDN'T HELP IN THAT KIND OF SITUATION. SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF BARRIERS HAVING TO DO WITH SEEK WITH IT'S NOT ABOUT THE STREAMLINING. AND MY OFFER TO YOU WHICH STILL STANCES LET'S. LOOK AT SEEK WELL LET'S HAVE HEARINGS AND LOOK AT THOSE BARRIERS AND WHAT IS IT THAT'S CAUSING. THOSE KINDS OF HOLD UPS IS IT A FAILURE TO GET GENERAL PLANS UPDATED. IS IT THAT JUDGES ARE STOPPING PROJECTS ONE REALLY THEY COULD PROCEED WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO FIX THOSE DOCUMENTS. AND YOU KNOW SEEK WELL AS YOU KNOW SEQUEL IS A TOOL FOR DECISION MAKERS IT'S NOT A DOCUMENT THAT TELLS A DECISION MAKER THAT THEY HAVE TO APPROVE A PROJECT OR NOT APPROVE IT IT'S JUST SUPPOSED TO GIVE INFORMATION. AND IT NEEDS TO BE AN ACCURATE DOCUMENT. SO THAT THE DECISION MAKERS CAN MAKE THE DECISION ANSWER THAT THE COMMUNITIES CAN WAY AND I THINK WHAT YOU'VE HEARD. IS SOME DISQUIET FROM SOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THESE AREAS. THAT THEY FEEL THAT AS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY SHOULDN'T BE GIVEN SORT OF LESS TIME TO WEIGH IN OR DO YOU TO HAVE THAT PROCESS THAT THEY WANT. THE SAME AMOUNT OF PROCESS THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES GET SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE. BUT I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I THINK NO ONE COULD ARGUE WITH YOUR PASSION FOR BRINGING GOOD JOBS AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO THESE AREAS I THINK WE ALL WANT TO DO THAT I? I THINK THAT. THIS AGREEMENT THAT YOU AND I ARE HAVING IS WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO REALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE FROM THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT WHERE THOSE HANG UPS ARE. WHEN THEY HAVE PROJECTS THAT ARE PROPOSED AND OF SEEK WAS A PROBLEM? WHAT IS IT? THAT IS CAUSING JUDGES. TO AGREE WITH LITIGANTS IN SOME CASES AND SAY THAT THE SECRET DOCUMENTS WERE AN ADEQUATE OR THAT SOMETHING KIND OF ONE SIDE WAYS IN THE PROCESS -- OR IF IF IT'S TAKING LONGER THAN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS JUST TO GET INTO THE COURT SYSTEM WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES DO WE NEED TO GIVE OUR COURT SYSTEM. TO HAVE CASES DISPENSE WITH MORE QUICKLY WITHOUT [inaudible] RINGING SOME. CASES TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE OVER OTHERS -- YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO REALLY HAVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT -- SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW I DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU YOU KNOW I'VE ALSO WORKED ON SEAQUEST. AND SOME OF MY LEGISLATION I THINK THAT YOU AND I HAVE A LOT OF THE SAME GOALS -- SO I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW YOU'RE COMING INVENTING. ARE YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME TO VENT IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE -- I THINK THAT'S HOW WE GET PROGRESS AND YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THAT PUBLIC AIRING OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I I APPRECIATE IT -- THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT WE OBVIOUSLY DISAGREE ON ON ON THE PARAMETERS OF OF KIND OF WHAT'S GOING ON BUT BUT I DID COMMIT. TO HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS -- FRANKLY -- THE CHALLENGE THAT I SEE IS THAT -- AS YOU'LL SEE THIS IS SB TWENTY FIVE I FILED IT IN DECEMBER IT'S BEEN IN PRINT SINCE DECEMBER. AND YET I JUST GOT. PROPOSED LANGUAGE. PROBABLY WITHIN THE LAST WEEK I DON'T REMEMBER WITH THE DATE OF THE LETTER IS -- AND AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THAT WHAT I'VE HEARD IS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY IS WE HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT AND FRANKLY I CAN'T DEAL WITH PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENTS IN A BILL. I'M EITHER EITHER WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO RESOLVE WHAT IS A LONG LASTING PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND DISAGREE ON ON THE THE WAY TO GET THERE OR OR WE SIT DOWN AND WE WE WORK ON LANGUAGE IT ACTUALLY GET TO US THERE. IS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS A MAGIC NUMBER NO BUT IT'S WHERE YOU START AND THEN YOU NEGOTIATE AND SO I I'VE ALWAYS I'M GONNA GO SHEET OR THAT'S WHAT I DO AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO SEE. IF IT'S THE WRONG APPROACH THIS FIGURE OUT WITH THE RIGHT APPROACHES BUT I CAN'T IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IN LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM THERE AND SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU WE I'M I MAY DO THAT PROMISE -- OBVIOUSLY NOT HAPPY WITH. THIS BE IS THIS BEING A TO YOUR BILL BUT BUT I I DO BELIEVE THAT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS CAN GET TO THE BOTTOM OF SOME OF THIS. AND IN THE END SOME OF THE DATA IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TO GET BECAUSE THE THREAT OF LITIGATION ENDS UP -- CHASING OFF PEOPLE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE MAKE INVESTMENTS IT'S THE MEETINGS I'VE HELD THE ENTIRE YEAR I'VE HEARD THAT MESSAGE WILL GET THEM TO COME AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THAT WITH YOU BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW MANY CASES HAVE BEEN FILED AND HOW LONG DID THEY TAKE. AND WHAT WAS THE GRANT IF YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE DATA THAT YOU NEED -- IT IT IT IT. IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT ND IT'S IT'S I I WANTED I'D I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT. THE IDEA THAT I WOULD WANT TO TRAMPLE. ON THE RIGHT OF THE MINORITY COMMUNITY PEOPLE OF COLOR COLOR I FIND REALLY OFFENSIVE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE. TO GO THROUGH THE REGULAR PROCESSES THAT THAT ARE SET UP AND THEN TO HAVE AN EXPEDITED REVIEW SO THAT WE CAN GET TO TO CONCLUSION. AND HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME CERTAINTY SO IN ANY CASE WE DID AGREE WITH WE'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER I HIKE BIKE COMMIT THAT I WILL -- IN GOOD FAITH AND WILL BRING ALL THE PARTIES TOGETHER SO WE CAN HAVE A REAL HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SOME CHANGES THAT'LL THAT'LL. THAT'LL SATISFY YOU THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DIFFERENCES SO I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY BE HERE TODAY I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT OPPORTUNITY WELL THANK YOU SENATOR AND WE MAKE IT WE WILL KEEP WORKING. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY I SEE SENATOR DODD WITH SP ONE NINETY AND TWO FORTY SEVEN I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PASS THE GOBBLING GO VOTING TRANSPORTATION BUT YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS WITH VICE CHAIR.

ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEE A NON BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE A QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEE ENOUGH OF THE COMMITTEE WHO GOT A MOTION A SECOND ITEMS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL -- I'M SORRY SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE I PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I TO MAY SB ONE NINETY BY SENATOR DODD THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN FLORA FLORA I'D CHAU. EGGMAN [inaudible] FONG. YEAH. GARCIA ISLA MON. MATHIS. MATHIS I MCCARTY. BROUGHT TO TREAT STONE THAT BILL ON CALL WAY FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK NEXT UP IS SB. TWO FORTY SEVEN YES SIR -- MR MEMBERS LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS. AS WE ALL KNOW EXTREME WEATHER IT'S INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND THE LENGTH OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON. ADEQUATE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING THE RISK OF TREES AND BRUSH -- CONTACTING ELECTRICAL LINES OF EQUIPMENT. PART OF CAL FIRES MISSION IS TO PREVENT FIRES CAL PARTS FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAM INCLUDES WILDLAND PRE FIRE ENGINEERING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FIRE PLANNING. EDUCATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. UNDER CURRENT LAW INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES MUST PROVIDE THE CPUC WITH VEGETATION MAYOR FOR PLAN AS PART OF THE I OWE YOU WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLAN FURTHER UNDER CURRENT LAW. THE CPC MUST CONSULT WITH CAL FIRE WHEN REVIEWING IT IN APPROVING EACH WALL FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. SB TWO FORTY SEVEN WOULD SIMPLY REQUIRE CALIFORNIA CAL FIRE SKEWS ME TO AUDIT EACH ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS. DIGITECH DIGIT TATIAN THE MANAGEMENT WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE UTILITY HAS SATISFACTORILY. CARRY THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN WORKS SET FORTH IN ITS WHILE PART MITIGATION PLAN. RECENTLY JUDGE ELSE OF OVERSEE P. GENIES PROBATION IT SAID BROOKE CASE SAID P. JEANNIE HASN'T CUT THE RIGHT TREES. IN MANAGING VEGETATIONS IN THE NEAR ITS POWER LIGHTS IN RESPONSE P. JEANNIE SAID MY QUOTE THERE'S A LOT OF TREES OUT THERE WE DON'T HAVE EYES ON ALL OF THEM. MISTER CHAIRMAN -- IN MEMBERS I'D SUBMIT LET'S GIVE THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES THE EYES THEY NEED TO ADEQUATELY BUT MANAGED EDUCATION AND CUT THE RIGHT TREATS I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OPPOSITION RESPECT WE THAT'S FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. X. CENTER FIRST WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE. MARK JOSEPH FOR THE COALITION CALIFORNIA TILL THE EMPLOYEES. THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE CHANCE OF A FUTURE WILDFIRE BECAUSE UTILITY FAILED TO TRIM THE TREE. RIGHT NOW THE THE UTILITY DECIDES WHAT TREE TRIMMING IS NEEDED IT PERFORMS THE WORK AND THAT IT OUGHT ITS ITS OWN WORK pCONTRACTORS. AFTER A FIRE CAL FIRE COMES ALONG AN INVESTIGATION DECIDES WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE AND SOMETIMES THESE DECIDE THAT IT THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BECAUSE SOMEONE FAILED TO TRIM A TREE. THAT'S NICE TO KNOW AFTER THE FACT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER TO KNOW WHAT BEFORE THE FACTS BEFORE THE FIRE. THIS BILL WOULD HAVE CAL FIRE AUDIT THE UTILITIES WORK RIGHT AWAY BEFORE ANY FIRE AND TELL THE UTILITY IF IT'S MISSED ANYTHING. THEN UTILITY HAS A CHANCE TO FIX. THE MISTAKE RIGHT AWAY. THEN CAL FIRE REPORTS THE RESULTS OF ITS AUDIT TO THE PC. THIS A GREAT A REALLY POWERFUL INCENTIVE THE UTILITY TO FIX EVERY EVERY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROBLEM THE CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T. THERE'S A PAPER TRAIL THE CALIFORNIA TOLD IN THOSE A TREE THEY SUPPOSED TO TRIMMING THE INTERNET. WHEN I THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WE THINK UTILITY WILL JUMP AND EVERY PROBLEM THE CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES? IN THE CALIFORNIA AUDITING THE WORK BEFORE. THE FIRE IS A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM THAN SELF AUDITING. THIS DOES NOT INCREASE ANY EXPENSE FOR CALIFORNIA -- BECAUSE IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE BURST BY THE UTILITY FOR THE WORK IT DOES IT WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND RESULT IN FEWER FIRES CAUSED BY MISTAKES AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT. THIS YEAR MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WET YOUR BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA'S DISSOCIATION ELECTRICAL WORKERS -- WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL THAT WAS JUST OUTLINED BY MISTER JOSEPH THE SECOND PART OF THE BILLS EQUALLY IMPORTANT -- PGD IN JUST THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAS GONE FROM. A WORK FORCE WORKING FOR CONTRACTORS DO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WITH ABOUT A THOUSAND WORKERS TO CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND WORKERS -- WE REPRESENT ALL THESE MEMBERS IT'S A IT'S A VERYTRANSITORY WORKFORCE IT'S A IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. WE'RE GETTING IN A SITUATION WHERE THEIR SECOND AND THIRD AND FOURTH TIER SUBCONTRACTORS. IN THESE CONTRACTORS MANY OF WHICH ARE COMING FROM OUT OF STATE. THEY SHOW UP TWENTY TRUCKS UNKNOWN PLEASE. AND THE NEXT DAY THEY SHOW UP WITH TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES WHICH IS FINE. BUT THEY'RE NOT INVESTING IN ANY TRAINING AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS ACCIDENTS AND DEATHS. ARE ARE ARE OFF THE CHARTS. TWO IS HAPPENING IS LOW LEVEL -- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TECHNICIANS -- ARE GOING OUT IN THE FIELD AND GIVING CHAINSAWS IN BEING ASKED TO DO WORK THAT SHOULD REQUIRE. A A A LINE CLEARANCE TREE TRIMMER WHICH IS A HIGHER LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT AND HAS SOME TRAINING. JUST ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO WE HAD AN EMPLOYEE THAT WAS NOT TRAINED POULTRY OVER ON THEMSELVES THINKING THEY COULD OUT RUN THE TREE. SO IN A TWO YEAR PERIOD WE HAD SEVENTY FIVE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS. WITH FIFTY FOUR HOSPITALIZATIONS ELEVEN DEATHS WE THINK THAT THE THE NUMBER OF OF ACCIDENTS AND DEATHS JUST OVER THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS FAR EXCEED THAT. WITH THIS BILL DOES IS IT DIRECTS THE P. YOU SEE WORKING AT THE UTILITIES TO DEVELOP A CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. TO REQUIRE THAT THESE WORKERS BE TRAINED TO A CERTAIN CERTIFICATION -- CIVIL SO THAT WE CAN AVOID THESE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS AND DEATHS THE UTILITIES ARE ON BOARD WITH ITS WEIRD VIRGIN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. OKAY ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. YES -- MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE I B. W. LOCAL TWELVE FORTY FOUNDER STERN IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. OKAY IS THERE ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SING ON WILL COME BACK TO THE DíAS. WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION I WOULD -- I ALSO HOPE THAT THIS ENCOURAGES THE UTILITIES TO YOU TO DEVELOP IN STATE LABOR -- IS SUPPOSED TO BRING PEOPLE IN FROM OUT OF STATE -- AND I ALSO HOPE THAT YOU INCREASE THE TRAINING ABOUT JUST GOOD HORTICULTURE I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THIS IS UNDER AN ARBORIST SUPERVISION BUT WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT TREES THAT HAVE BEEN SUB. THE TRIMMING SUBCONTRACTED OUT FROM UTILITIES AND JUST THE CONTRACTORS DOING A REALLY ABYSMAL JOB -- IN TRIMMING AND CREATING DANGEROUS SITUATIONS OF TREES THAT ARE OFF BALANCE IT OPEN TOPPED OFF -- MY OFFICE PROBABLY GETS MORE COMPLAINTS. ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW THAT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE SO I HOPE THAT YOU TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. THAT YOU KNOW -- THERE ARE. WAYS TO TRIM THAT MAINTAIN SAFETY BUT ALSO KEEPS THE PLANTS -- INTEGRITY INTACT AND DOESN'T DAMAGE FROM IN THE SAME WAY SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL. HERE THAT THAT THAT UTILITIES HERE THAT AS WELL -- WITHOUT TO WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY WE'VE A MOTION AND A SECOND DO YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. LAST PRIVATE. OKAY WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM ELEVEN SB TWO FORTY SEVEN BY SENATOR DODD THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. PHONE. FONG AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE LOW MOAN. AT THIS. MATHIS AYE MCCARTY. BROUGHT TO G. [inaudible] STONE. FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO BELIEVE THE BILL I THINK YOU. THIRTY TWO ONE NINE A MISTER GLORIA. MR OUT MISTER ALLEN THERE YOU ARE. SORRY I DIDN'T TO EUROPE NEXT IF YOU ARE READY [inaudible] YES [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH MENTAL PRESIDENT AND YOU'RE HERE WITH US AND HE FIFTY FOUR YES SB -- FIFTY FOUR I WANT TO THINK THAT MY CO AUTHORS ON THIS MEASURING AND INCLUDING THE CHAIR. I AM VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT TO THE ANALYSIS -- IN A MEMBERS IT'S BEEN SO CLEAR I THINK TO ALL OF US THAT WE HAVE A PLASTICS POLLUTION CRISIS ON OUR HANDS. WE SEE THE PICTURES OF OCEAN POLLUTION AND OF DEAD MARINE LIFE FOR THE STOMACH FULL OF PLASTIC WASHING ON OUR SHORES -- BUT SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S ONE WHOLE ISSUE BUT I I WILL SAY THAT IN ADDITION AND OF OF ALSO GRAVE IMPORTANCE IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND ARE RECYCLERS ARE ARE FEELING THE PROBLEM VERY ACUTELY. AND I THINK MOST MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE KNOW ABOUT CHINA'S NATIONAL SORT POLICY THE DECISION THAT WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER NATION ASIAN NATIONS. TO NO LONGER ACCEPT A RECYCLING. AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE BOTTOM TO FALL OUT OF OUR RECYCLING MARKETS AND IT'S COSTING CITIES AND COUNTIES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CHINA. I HAD BEEN ACCEPTING ABOUT 40% OF OUR RECYCLED MATERIAL FROM UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA SHE WAS A 56%. 76% OF ALL OF OUR RECYCLED MATERIAL WAS GOING OFF TO CHINA -- AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT PLASTICS NUMBERS -- THREE THREE SEVEN ME THOSE KINDS OF PLASTICS WERE FETCHING ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS PER TIME. IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE. PAYING ARE PAYING. ROUGHLY TEN DOLLARS A TIME TO DISPOSE OF THREE THREE SEVEN PLASTICS -- MORE MORE OFTEN THAT MEANS THE MATERIALS JUST SIMPLY BEING LANDFILLS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T. I PAY FOR ITSELF SO WE ARE ALL DILIGENTLY SORTING OUR RECYCLABLES INTO BLUE BINS -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOW THE MATERIAL IS LESS LIKELY TO BE PROCESS RECYCLING TODAY THAN IT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND ON TOP OF THE DISPOSAL COSTS EVERY YEAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SPENDING ABOUT HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR IN ONGOING EFFORTS JUST TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LITTER IN STREETS AND STORM DRAINS. PARKS AND WATERWAYS SO IT'S BECOMING A WHOLE NEW TAX. THAT IS MONEY THAT COULD BE GOING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT -- TO IMAGE SERVICES FOR SENIORS GIVEN BACK TO TAXPAYERS HELP THE SCHOOLS WHATEVER. WHATEVER MAY BE. NOT SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOW AT AT AT AND AND A CRISIS POINT -- IN AND WHAT WE GOT TO TAKE BOLD ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS THIS BILL IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP -- IN THAT DIRECTION THIS COMMITTEE HAS PASSED THE COMPANION LEGISLATION IN THE PAST IT WAS AB -- TEN EIGHTY IT'S GONNA TAKE A SUITE OF TOOLS SUCH AS MINIMUM CYCLE CONTENT STANDARDS EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY TO BOLSTER. THE RECYCLING MARKETS IN OUR STATE MAY COLLECTION RECYCLED RECYCLING PROFITABLE AGAIN -- WHILE ENSURING MANUFACTURERS HAVE A STEADY CLEAN SUPPLY OF MATERIAL -- THERE'S A LONG OFFRAMP ASSOCIATED -- TILL TWENTY THIRTY BEFORE IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN THAT WILL CERTAINLY ALLOW FOR A LOT OF LEAD TIME TO ALLOW MANUFACTURES EITHER SWITCH. TO MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS OR BY USING WERE RECYCLED CONTENT THEIR PACKAGING ENSURE THAT THE MATERIAL THAT THEY WANT TO USE. MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL -- I KNOW THAT EVEN WHILE WE'VE -- SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION -- WE STILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO WE'VE BEEN HAVING A SERIES OF VERY PRODUCTIVE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OVER THE BREAK I WAS AT THE FIRST. ONE IN MY OFFICE JUST LAST WEEK AND AND AND WE'RE GONNA BE WE'RE BREAKING UP VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE BILL TO FOCUS ON ON ON DIFFERENT AREAS OF IT TO THE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HEARING REALLY ROBUSTLY FROM. FROM -- FROM THE OPPOSITION FROM INDUSTRY FROM AND IF FROM ADVOCACY GROUPS ALSO FROM OUR FOLKS WHO WORK ON WASTE MANAGEMENT OUR CITIES -- BUT MEMBERS ANCHORED YOU GET ON THE PHONE TALK TO ONE OF YOUR LOCAL CITY MANAGERS WHEN YOUR LOCAL MAYORS. JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE LOCAL CITIES ARE FACING WEBER NOW WITH REGARD TO THIS WASTE MANAGEMENT CRISIS THIS BILL IS GOING. TO HELP THEM TREMENDOUSLY IS WHY WE HAVE SUCH STRONG SUPPORT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I AM AND I'VE GOT. FOLKS FROM FROM BOTH THOSE ACTORS WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. OKAY WITH THIS PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS THEIR COFFEE ON BEHALF LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITIES -- I DO WONDERS TO ECHO THE COMMENTS LAID OUT BY SENDER ALAN GIVE YOU JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE CITIES THAT ARE -- AND WHAT THEY'RE FACING SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF FULSOME -- THE CITY'S PRE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH IS PRE -- CHINA NATIONAL SORTS IMPLEMENTATION THEIR AVERAGE ANNUAL REVENUE FROM REPRESENTS RECYCLING WAS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS NOW THEY'RE EXPECTING TO PAY EXCUSE ME PAY APPROXIMATE THREE TO EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND JUST FOR CONTEXT EARNS TIRE SOLID WASTE BUDGET IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WAS JUST ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE FROM CULVER CITY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- BEFORE CHINA IMPLEMENTED THE NATIONAL SORT POLICY CULVER CITY WAS NETTING AROUND FOURTEEN EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FROM ITS RECYCLING PROGRAM. AND NOW THAT REVENUE HAS ALL BUT DISAPPEARED. WITHOUT THESE MARKETS THESE RECYCLED MATERIALS ARE NOW PILING UP WITH NO PLACE TO GO. SB FIFTY FOUR WILL HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MANAGE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE GENERATED FOR SEVERAL REASONS. THE REQUIRED CORPORATE ENTITIES TO ACHIEVE A 75% REDUCTION OF WASTE GENERATED FROM SINGLE USE PACKAGING PRIORITY ST USE PLASTIC PRODUCTS BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND WILL REQUIRE THAT THESE PRODUCTS BE RECYCLE OR COMPOSTABLE BY THAT TIME AS WELL. MY SOURCE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WASTE GENERATED ON THE FRONT END WILL BETTER HELP CITIES MANAGE THE VOLUME AND TYPES OF MATERIALS DISPOSED OF ON THE BACK AND CITIES HAVE DEDICATED SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP. AND IMPLEMENT THE RECYCLING PROGRAMS I WANT TO ENSURE THAT CITY RECYCLING PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SB FIFTY FOUR WILL HELP CITY STRENGTH IN THE RECYCLING PROGRAMS THROUGH DEVELOPING MARKETS FOR CYCLE MATERIALS IN CALIFORNIA AND CREATING MORE HIGH QUALITY RECYCLED MATERIALS WITH LESS CONTAMINATION. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE LONG BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA CHIEF IT'S RECYCLING WASTE MANAGEMENT GOALS. THIS BILL WOULD HELP REDUCE WASTE AT ITS SOURCE BEFORE IT GETS TO LOCAL LANDFILLS AND RECYCLING CENTERS OR WORSE OUR BEACHES AND OTHER BEAUTIFUL NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS. SB FIFTY FOUR WILL HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECYCLE MORE MATERIALS FOR LESS AWAY IN LANDFILLS AND ADVANCED TOWARDS BEING STATEWIDE SOLD WASTE RECYCLING GOALS WITHOUT I HEARD YOUR SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME'S ERIC PASSION WITH RECOLOGY A RECOVERY COMPANY WE MANAGE RECYCLING COMPOSTING AND SOLID WASTE COLLECTION PROCESSING AND DISPOSAL SERVICES IN OVER A HUNDRED URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE OPERATE IN IN STATE NETWORK OF A MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES ARE MURPHY AND FOR COMPOST SITES. PROJECTED RECOLOGY IS CAPTURED PLASTIC PACKAGING MATERIALS THROUGH A RECYCLING PROGRAMS AND STATE MARKET MUCH OF THAT MATERIAL FREE USE PRINCIPALLY THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA. AND FOR MANY RIGID PLASTIC CONTAINERS WERE STILL SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING MARKETS BOTH DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL. FOR THESE MATERIALS TO BE REAR MANUFACTURED INTO NEW PRODUCTS. HOWEVER INTERNATIONAL POLICY REFORMS MOST NOTABLY CHINA'S NATIONAL SORT PROGRAM WHICH SET STRINGENT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR FIBER COMMODITIES AND OUTRIGHT BAN MAKES PLASTIC IMPORTS HAVE CLOSED NEARLY ALL IN MARKETS FOR MOST OF THE FILM PLASTIC SINGLE USE PACKAGING PRODUCTS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE REFORMS ARE COMPANY INVESTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR SAN FRANCISCO MURPH WITH FOUR STAY THE OUR OPTICAL SORTERS NEW COMPARES THE BEST IN CLASS FILM PLASTIC RECOVERY SYSTEM THAT CAN PRODUCE BILLS THAT MEET THE HIGHEST. MARKET STANDARDS. WE CAN MAKE A FILM PLASTIC BELL AT LESS THAN 2% CONTAMINATION BUT WE CAN'T FIND A HOME FOR IT AND IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING. WE HAVE FOLLOWED THE WORK OF INNOVATIVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REVERSE EGINEER% THE PLASTICS MANUFACTURING. PROCESS AND RECLAIM THE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AT WHICH ME THESE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN CREATED FROM UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF THESE EFFORTS A PROVEN SCALABLE. WE EVEN TRY TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS OURSELVES FOR FIVE YEARS REAR RECOLOGY EMPLOYED A CHEMICAL ENGINEER WITH TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF PLASTIC MANUFACTURING EXPERIENCE. IS GIVEN THE MISSION TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO WITH A SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE HIS WORK NET MEDI NO PRACTICAL RESULTS. WE'VE MET WITH MANUFACTURERS MANY OF WHOM ARE REPRESENTED IN THIS ROOM TODAY AND ASK THEM TO HELP US LOCATE A PROCESSING PLANT WHERE WE CAN TAKE THESE CLEAN BILLS OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC MATERIAL AND TURN THEM INTO SOMETHING NEW. NO SE WAS IDENTIFIED. SIMPLE FACT IS THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH PLASTIC INTO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTICS THAT ARE BEING PRODUCED A FROM A SINGLE USE STANDPOINT. THERE IS A FEW IF ANY VIABLE AND MARKETS FOR THE MATERIAL. WHICH MAKES CLOSING THIS LOOP NEARLY UNATTAINABLE SO ON BEHALF FOR ECOLOGY WE SUPPORT SB FIFTY FOUR WHICH HAS A PROMISE TO HELP DRIVE THE INDUSTRY TOWARDS. THE NEED TO CHANGE BY REQUIRING PLASTIC IN SINGLE USE MATERIAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE RECYCLE OR COMPOST WILL BY. TWENTY THIRTY BECAUSE HE'S EMPLOYEE OWNERS ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE EFFECTS AND PROLIFIC PROLIFERATION OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTING WERE COMMITTING HELPING CALIFORNIA BECOME A LEADER ON THIS FRONT. WE USE -- RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE FINISHED HEARING TESTIMONY SO ANYBODY WHO WISHES TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT JUST NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION YOU'RE REPRESENTING THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TOUCH HIM JUST LIKE WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL -- WE ARE A SAY -- MY INDUSTRY IN MY ORGANIZATION MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE ESTABLISHED. A SOME VERY AMBITIOUS RECYCLING GOALS FOR PLASTIC PACKAGING VERY SIMILAR-- TO THE TWENTY THIRTY OBJECTIVE OUTLINED IN AND SENATE BILL FIFTY FOUR SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS IT AN ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT -- WE ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH WHAT THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS OF A CENTER ALLEN'S BILL BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE CURRENT PROVISIONS THE BILL THAT WE BELIEVE. I NEED TO BE WORKED ON AS WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS DURING THE THE SUMMER BREAK A COUPLE THOSE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE IS THE BILLS. EXTREME AND ARGUE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY THE COW OR CYCLE TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS WITHOUT ANY SORT OF OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE OR A OR ANY GUIDELINES THE WAY THAT WE READ THE BILL NOW -- CAL RECYCLE IS FREE TO DEVELOP ANY SORT OF REGULATION -- TO ACHIEVE THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE -- THAT. WOULD CUT COULD SUBSTANTIALLY HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. THE SECOND PROVISION I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THIS -- A CONDITION OF SALE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW THERE'S SOME IN ARM RECYCLING -- PERCENTAGES THAT MUST BE MET -- OTHERWISE YOUR PACKAGE IS PROHIBITED FROM BEING SOLD IN THE STATE -- I PROVIDED EXAMPLE OF IS THE FIRST FIRST -- HURDLE IS A 20% RATE BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF OF A PACKAGE REACHES 19% BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY IN OUR VIEW AND HOW THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WE THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME SORT OF FLEXIBILITY ACCOUNT RECYCLE -- AROUND THESE INTERIM RATES -- TO ALLOW FOR MARKET CONDITIONS MARKET REALITIES INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE PUT. TOGETHER A SET OF SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROVIDE TO CENTER AROUND AS WELL AS SELLING ADVOCATES ALSO STAFF. TO CONSIDER DURING -- THE INTERN DISCUSSIONS THAT US AROUND REFERENCE EARLIER -- THESE PROVIDE SOME DIRECTION A COW OR CYCLE OF PROVIDE WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A BASELINE OF INFORMATION TO HELP INFORM WHAT WOULD BE SOME REALISTIC -- RECYCLING GOALS -- TO TO TO ACHIEVE DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD BEFORE -- THE TWENTY THIRTY MANDATE. WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED A WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE A PROVISION THAT WOULD FORCE CERTAIN PACKAGING PRODUCERS -- IT WOULD IN THE A CC MEMBERSHIP AN INDUSTRY SPONSORED -- ADVANCE RECYCLING FEE TO HELP FUND SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE -- COULD BE NECESSARY NOT FOR JUST OF CYCLING BUT ALSO FOR THIS OTHER PERIL A PROVISION IN THE BILL DEALING WITH MARINE DEBRIS. AND OTHER LITTERED ITEMS SO WE THINK IT'S A A PROPOSAL THAT IS WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS DURING THE SUMMER -- TO HOPEFULLY REACH A POINT WHERE -- WE CAN WE CAN FIND SOME RESOLUTION TO SOME OF THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES BUT WE DO CURRENTLY -- HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL'S DRAFTED AND ARE OPPOSED TO LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATIONS A SUMMER THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOHN HERE IT ON BEHALF OF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS IN THE CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS PRODUCERS -- AS MISHA SIX STATED -- WE GENERALLY SUPPORT THE INTENT OR WE DO SUPPORT THE INTENT SB FIFTY FOUR AS IT ALIGNS WITH -- C. P. G.'S UNIFIED GOALS OF ENHANCING PACKAGE SUSTAINABILITY -- ANDAND AS AS WE DISCUSSED AND AND LYING TO THE AUTHOR BOTH AUTHORS -- TWENTY FIVE OF THE LARGE CBG COMPANIES ALREADY COMMITTED. TO MAKING MORE RECYCLABLE -- COMPOSTABLE PACKAGING IN 80% OF THEM OF ALREADY -- SET THAT TWENTY THIRTY DEADLINE IN WRITING -- AND MADE THAT COMMITMENT TOWARDS THAT -- WITH THAT SAID WE STILL DO HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- MOST NOTABLY THE BILL CREATES A SYSTEM -- SPECIFICALLY THE CONDITION OF SALE WHERE THE MANUFACTURE THE CBG COMPANIES WILL. BEAR ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRODUCT -- WITHOUT THE ABILITY IMPROVE THE SYSTEM OR PROMOTE -- FOR COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE CAN DESIGN FOR RECYCLABILITY WE CAN DESIGN FOR COMPOSED ABILITY AND AS I MENTIONED WE'VE MADE THOSE COMMITMENTS TO THAT -- BUT WE CAN NOT DESIGNED FOR THE MORE HUNDRED AND MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY JURISDICTIONS -- AND THE INDIVIDUAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT IS PROBLEMATIC. TO THE CG COMPANIES -- TO MAKE THIS WORK LONG TERM -- WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP THE DEFINITIONS EXPLORE THE OFF RAMPS INVEST -- AND INVESTIGATE THE NEEDS OF OF THE WASTE AND AND THE AND THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE STATE -- I NOR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT THE SENATOR AND AND AND THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN HAVE COMMITTED -- TO WILL HELP US GET THERE -- THEY DID THIS PROCESS IN THE TIME LINES IT'S GOING TO BE FAST WERE WERE BRINGING THE SOLUTIONS AND AND OUR IDEAS TO THE TABLE WE MADE SPECIFIC. AMENDMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR A MOMENT SAYS MISTER JACKSON HAS AS WELL. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO FROM ASPIRATIONAL THE ACTUAL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE TIME TO GET THIS RIGHT WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING. AND GETTING IT RIGHT CBG IS AS PUT THOSE NUMBERS OUT THERE WE STAND BY THOSE -- BUT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WERE A PRINTER EXTREMELY TIGHT TIME FRAME HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DON KHAKI MCCUE CAP CAN ASSOCIATE SOMEHOW THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ASSUMES HE WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE AN OPPOSITION THANK YOU.

OKAY I'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DíAS FOR COMMENTS. SOME MEMBER EGGMAN [inaudible] WELL. SO THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I'VE HEARD THIS THE BILL -- IN THE PREVIOUS AUTHOR WITH A A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW. MEETINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN IN NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOING TO HAPPEN IN -- AND NOW WE'RE BACK HERE WITH THIS. PART TWO AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED YET SEEMS LIKE. SEEMS LIKE THERE'S LIKE THIS I MEAN I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LOOKING FORTY MEETINGS IN THE OVER THE BREAK. SO THAT'S GREAT -- BUT STILL LIKE NOT A LOT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR OR JUST BARELY HAVE STARTED -- SO I'M JUST WONDERING FOR THE SAKE OF MY MY COMFORT. CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH KIND OF THE THE TIME LINE AS YOU SEE FOR THE THE SCOPING PLAN OF THIS. AND AS WERE SCOPING OUT WHAT IN IS IT AT ANY POINT WILL THE RULE MAKING GOING TO AFFECT BEFORE THE SCOPING IS EVEN DONE. OR HOW HOW YOU. WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR THAT. OKAY WELL FIRST OF ALL. A LOT A LOT HAS HAPPENED I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IT'S IT'S BEEN GOING AND AND AND THE BILL IS. CHANGED QUITE A BIT SINCE SINCE YOU SAW IT LAST -- ONE OF THE MAJOR NARROWING DOWN THAT TOOK PLACE WAS FOCUSING ON THE TOP TEN MOST -- POLLUTING PRODUCTS AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN WHERE WHERE THE THE CORE FOCUS OF THE OF THE BILL AND AND THE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION IS GOING TO BE -- BUT THE THE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN ON THE TO GET OFF THIS PART OF GETTING OFF THE FLOOR -- INVOLVES PUSHING BACK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCOPING PLAN BY A YEAR. AND THE BILL SAYS THAT THE PLAN HAS TO BE DONE BEFORE THE REGULATIONS -- COME INTO PLAY SO HOT SO. YES THERE IS A THERE THERE THERE THERE'S EVEN IF JUST BEFORE TWENTY IF THAT'S POST TWENTY THIRTY IF IF THE SCOPING IS NOT COMPLETE. LET'S GO BE HAS TO BE DONE BY TWENTY BY THE J. FIRST. BILL AND AND AND AND THE REGULATIONS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT. HOW HOW LONG BEFORE THE SCOPING IS COMPLETE? AND THE REGULATIONS WOULD GOING TO AFFECT. THE BILL AS BEST BUY THAT TO THIS RESTAURANT OKAY SO SO I MEAN THEORETICALLY THIS COULD BE CONFINED SET SOMETHING TO BE IN THAT SINGLE USE AND BE NO TIME BETWEEN THEN. AND WHEN THE REGULATIONS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT THAT WOULD START REGULATING. WELL REMEMBER THE YOU KNOW THAT THE WHOLE SCOPING PROCESS IS. IN IS DELINEATED IN THE BILL IS GOING TO BE THE PRODUCT OF A WILL INVOLVE EVERYBODY INVOLVED INCLUDING MANUFACTURES AND FOLKS ON THE RETAIL SIDE [inaudible] AND SO THERE WILL BE IT I I'VE NOT DONE NOTHING IS GONNA COME OUT IT AT PEOPLE OUT BY SURPRISE RIGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE. A A LONG AND DRAWN OUT PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION AND DISCUSSION -- AND SO I DON'T THINK I MEAN I IS YOUR IS YOUR CORE CONCERNED PEOPLE. KIND OF GETTING THINGS STARTED DEMONIC SPECTER LEE OR WELL I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THE SAME AS WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION RIGHT THAT THERE IS NO CON DELINEATION OF WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SCOPING AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE DECIDING WHAT'S AND WOOD SIDING WITH TOWERS SIDING WITH THE THE CONTENT. I WILL BE -- AND THEN AND THEN RULE MAKING GOES INTO EFFECT SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE LEAD UP TIME IF ANY. THAT YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S REASONABLE FOR THAT DOES THE DOES THINGS TO COME TOGETHER. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE ARE? TWENTY NINETEEN THIS WOULD. PRISON WE PASSED BY THE END OF THE SESSION RIGHT IF IF IF EVERYTHING GOES BECAUSE WELL -- AND THEN. USE COPING IS IT. DOESN'T GET EMPTIED IT DOESN'T GET FINISHED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO IT'S QUITE A BIT OF TIME. I TO TO MAKE THAT PROCESS WORKING NOW HAVE ALL THE DISCUSSIONS TAKE PLACE AND SO THERE'S YOU KNOW. I I UNDERSTAND ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME FOLKS WHO WANT TO MAKE IT LONGER BUT I I BET THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME -- TO TO TO REALLY PUT TOGETHER ROBUST PROCESS. OKAY TODAY MY TWENTY FOUR DO THINK IT TO TELL. TWENTY THIRTY YES YES I MEAN AT TWENTY THIRTY WOULD BE THE KIND OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OF THE 75%. PRODUCTION THAT'S RIGHT YEAH IS YOUR IS YOUR CORE CONCERN IS IT THIS IS THIS IS TOO TIGHT TIME FRAME -- WELL I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT WERE WE ARE NOT I GUESS WE'RE NOT FURTHER ALONG IN THE IN THE PROCESS I MEAN I'VE HEARD FROM. A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF CONCERNS AND THE SAME CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT MANY OF US EXPRESSED WHEN WE SAW. THE THE OTHER AUTHORS VERSION OF THE BILL AND A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WE'LL GET THERE WE'LL GET THERE WILL GET THEIR WHAT'S IN WHAT'S OUT. AND SO NOW WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN IT DOWN TO THE THE TOP -- TEN AND THEN I GUESS MIKE DIDN'T ONE OF THE CONCERNS I CONTINUE TO HEAR AND I THINK WE ALL HERE THEN. IS THAT THEN THE DETERMINATION IS LEFT UP TO CAL RECYCLE AT THE VERY END SO WHAT POINT DOES IT COME BACK TO US. WE'VE GOT OVERSIGHT OVER THE WORK THEY DO AT ANY POINT WE CAN. CHANGE THE LAW FOR AND HAPPY WITH ANYTHING IS HAPPENING WITH AGGRESSIVE LIMITATION -- THE DOUBLE CHECK POINTS WHAT COMES BACK TO US EXCEPT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO A WHOLE NOTHER Là IF WE DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY. IT WE COULD CERTAINLY WE CAN CERTAINLY IF YOU WANT TO TALK SHOP ABOUT TRYING TO PUT SOME -- REPORTING BACK LANGUAGE OR OR YOU KNOW -- I THINK THE YEAH OKAY SO THE COMMITMENTS YES RIGHT OKAY SO THE COMMITMENTS TO REQUIRE REPORTING -- WE GET IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND MAKE SURE THAT. HERE WE ARE IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS -- IF YOU WANNA TALK SHOP ABOUT. STRUGGLING WERE SOMEHOW -- WEEK WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN THAT CONVERSATION -- FEET THAT'S I I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I MEAN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THAT WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON ON THE IMPLEMENTATION ON THE PROCESS -- AND THERE'S MORE EYES ON IT JUST AND CAL RECYCLE NOT THAT WE DON'T THINK THEY DO A GREAT JOB THERE BUT IT IS. WE'RE TAKING A YOU KNOW I'M AND WE ALL AGREE THERE'S TOO MUCH. PLASTIC RIGHT I'VE GOT A THE KID WHO JUST FINISHED FIFTH GRADE SO WHAT WE ALL GOT THE REPORT ON PLASTIC AND AM AND WHAT IT DOES. AND CERTAINLY MY HOUSE WE TRY TO USE AS LITTLE AS WE CAN. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S INDUSTRIES OUT THERE THEN THAT'S THAT THAT THAT IS THE PRODUCT THAT PEOPLE ARE USING RIGHT NOW SO AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHOLESALE CHANGES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY SINGLE USE ONCE HOW TO DO THAT WHAT IS COMPOSED OF ALL IN WHAT IS NOT WHAT IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE ALL THESE THINGS GOING TO BE. AND THEN SHOULD REALLY BE THE MANUFACTURERS JOB AND I LIKE BLACK MANY ANYBODY WHO WORKS IN THIS AREA. WHO GOES OUT AND SEEM MARCIN GORTAT GONE OUT AND TALKED -- CITY COUNCIL TWO THOUSAND SIX WERE TALKING AT SOME POINT CHINA IS NOT GOING TO WANT TO TRASH RIGHT RIGHT WE SHOULD BE GETTING READY A LONG TIME BEFORE AND WE DIDN'T AND NOW WE'RE HERE NOW. AND SO I'M GUESSING AS WE AS WE'RE GONNA SHE STOOD UP THE STARTING GUN AS WE'RE DOING THIS. THAT WERE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THEIR TIMELINES IN PLACE AND PROTECTIONS AND GUARD RAILS IN PLACE THAT WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK AND TRY TO REDO. UNDO WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WE DO SOMETHING ELSE. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AND I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE CONCERNS -- FOR ANYBODY WHO'S A LEGISLATOR INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA AND ANYTIME. I MEAN HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HEAR ABOUT THE A. R. B. BOARD AND AND EVERY AGENCY THAT WE GIVE A AUTHORITY. TO WE OFTEN TIMES AND COMING BACK AND SAYING WHO'S MAKING DECISIONS IS IT AN AGENCY WAS SOMEBODY APPOINTED OR IS ELECTED PEOPLE THAT WE SEND THEIR TO REPRESENT US. I'D GET IT BUT I GUESS BUT WE KNOW WHAT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE ENDS UP DOING OFTENTIMES IS IS. CAN A PIECEMEAL APPROACH WE DO ONE OFF BILLS OR BANNING ONE PARTICULAR PLASTIC ITEM -- WERE WERE WERE BEEN GAUGING IN ONE LITTLE PIECE OF THIS BROAD PIE I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE. WAS ACTUALLY MORE HOLISTIC MORE MORE -- YEAH MORE REALISTIC IN THE IN THIS APPROACH WE'VE GOT A GOT A BIG PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS AND YOU KNOW I WAS THE TO THE ASSEMBLY SUPPORT OF OF THE STRAW BALE BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST STRAWS RIGHT I MEAN IT IT YOU. KNOW WE GET WE PASS THAT BILL OR NOT PASSED A BILL AND NOT REALLY HI IF IT'S NOT IN FOR ITS UNFORTUNATE NOT GONNA MOVE THE ENVELOPE IN A IN A REALLY SERIOUS WAY -- AND BY THE WAY I WILL SAY THAT WE'RE NOT DOING AWAY WITH PLASTICS WITH THIS BILL WE'RE WE'RE JUST PUSHING THESE PRODUCTS. TOWARD A MORE SUSTAINABLE PLACE AND NOT THAT'S THAT'LL DEALING WITH THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IT'S IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT. U. DRAMATICALLY CHANGING EVEN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IT'S JUST THAT THAT WE KNOW THERE ARE BETTER PRODUCTS OUT THERE IS ACTUALLY ALREADY BEING SOLD IN A LOT OF PLACES -- BUT THEN THE MARKET A LITTLE BIT OF A NUDGE TO PUSH. OUR TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE MORE RECYCLABLE MORE -- REUSABLE COMPOSTABLE ALTERNATIVES NO THOSE ARE A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE NEXT IS A LITTLE MUCH. IT IS A LITTLE NUDGE ADVOCATE COULD CUT BECAUSE WHAT I BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU HERE. I'M EVEN THE BILL FIRST CAME OUT -- YOU KNOW -- INDUSTRY IS IS ALREADY MOVING VERY DIRECTLY IN THIS DIRECTION -- AND VERY PURPOSEFULLY I ACTUALLY THINK IT WILL BENEFIT AN ADVANTAGE A LOT OF HOME GROWN CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS WHO HAVE ALREADY MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THIS AREA OVER. MANUFACTURES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHO MAY BE LESS SUSTAINABLE IN THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES I THINK THAT'S WHY -- YEAH THERE'S OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT ANY ATTEMPT BY THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN AND REGULATE A CERTAIN ASPECT OF THE WAY THAT WE MANUFACTURE THINGS BUT I DO THINK. THAT THAT THE THE SAVVY FOLKS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE -- WHO HAVE BEEN ENGAGING VERY ROBUSTLY WITH US AND IN THIS DISCUSSION UNDERSTAND THEY'RE ACTUALLY SOME REAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES HERE? FOR SUSTAINABLY ORIENTED -- CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES SOMETHING WITH WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH SOLAR RIGHT I MEAN THERE WAS A MOMENT AT WHICH SOLAR WAS SO EXPENSIVE IN THERE THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE. THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE NOW I WAS JUST AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE. THEY'RE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE SOLAR PANELS ON THEIR HOUSE AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY PENCIL OUT ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO SAVE THE MONEY -- YOU KNOW WITHIN ABOUT FIVE SIX YEARS. AND THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE TWENTY YEARS AGO RIGHT TO BE TWENTY YEARS AGO. EVERYBODY YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE BY PEOPLE WHO HAD A LOT OF MONEY TO BURN AND WANTED TO MAKE A POINT -- NOW WE'VE ACTUALLY YOU THROUGH A KIND A COMBINATION OF MARKET FORCES AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULAR YOU KNOW GOVERNMENTAL NAY JING HEY WE'VE GOT NO PLACE WHERE SOULS ACTUALLY NOW STARTING TO BECOME. AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE I THINK SIMILARLY -- WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS YOU KNOW IF YOU VIRGIN PLASTIC IS JUST SO CHEAP IT'S SO CHEAP. THERE ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT BUT COMPANIES JUST DON'T HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO MOVE TOWARD THOSE PRODUCTS. I AM ACTUALLY IF WE CAN HELP TO TO PUSH. WE CAN WE CAN WE TO PUSH PEOPLE THOSE DIRECTIONS WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE DROP THE PRICES AND ACTUALLY. GIVEN THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD KNOW THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AS WELL. I A IS MORE ENTITIES MORE JURISDICTIONS ADOPT THIS SORT OF MODEL WILL HELP TO DRIVE DOWN PRICES -- OVERALL I SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN I WOULD CONSIDER THIS EFFORT TO BE A FAILURE. IF WE PASS A GREAT BILL HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO SO -- IN A WAY THAT IMPACTS OUR ECONOMY SUCH THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUT WON'T WANT TO ADOPT SIMILAR MODELS I THINK AT THE HEART OF THIS. IS SHOWING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE BOTH IN TERMS OF DOING THE RIGHT BY ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO GROWING ECONOMICALLY. AND DOING RIGHT BY CONSUMERS ONLY WITH THE WITHOUT TRY FACT AND PLACE WILL BE ABLE TO TRULY SELL THIS MODEL TO OTHER STATES AND OTHER NATIONS. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE HAVE TO DO HERE I MEAN ULTIMATELY CALIFORNIA IT IS AN IMPORTANT PLACE AND I LOVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING ENVIRONMENTALLY HERE BUT THIS IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO SCALE THIS MODEL GLOBALLY. TO REALLY MAKE A A REAL DIFFERENCE GRAHAM AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IS IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT. BECAUSE I'LL I WILL ALSO SAY. I'M GOING TO THE SMALL CABIN OFF THE GRID RIGHT NOW WITH SOLAR IT DOESN'T WORK. RIGHT AND I CAN'T GET ANYBODY UP THERE TO FIX IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO FAR OFF THE GRID AND SO FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE SAY THE ME GREAT EVERYBODY'S GONNA DO IT. THERE ARE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN IT AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I SIT HERE AND STRUGGLE WITH. THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE HERE AND THAT AND THAT THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESALE PRODUCT OF THAT RECYCLABILITY. BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE MARKET YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT WHO MAKES IT AND WHAT AND BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MARKETS ALL OVER THE WORLD ON THIS ALL THE TIME. TO THAT HAVE THOSE TWO THINGS TIED TOGETHER. I ALSO THINK IT'S PROBLEMATIC SO I I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE WORKING IN THIS SPACE WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE WORK. BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A WE GOT IT RIGHT AND I THINK IT ADVOCATING TO AN OUTSIDE AGENCY IS ALWAYS MORE PROBLEMATIC WITHOUT REAL CHECKS AND BALANCES WITH US WITHOUT TIMELINES IT CLEARLY DELINEATE WHEN THIS IS COPING PLAN WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE THE INFORMATION. ON THAT AND THEN WHEN IT TO THE REGULATIONS GOING TO AFFECT AND THEN. ON ON THE AND MARKET ISSUES SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS. THE SUMMER GARCIA. THANK YOU SO I HAVE. THOSE ARE THE COMMENTS AND AND THEN I HAVE A SET OF QUESTIONS -- I DO RECOGNIZE THE AMENDMENTS WE YOU TOOK YOUR AND I ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS ALWAYS TOOK. TO GET THE ORIGINAL TEN EIGHTY OFF THE FLOOR AND THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE REFLECTED. IN IN THIS BILL SO I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT INCLUDES -- THE TOP TEN PIECE AND EXTENDING -- THEY'LL THE DEADLINE. FOR THE SCOPING PLAN SO I DO WANT TO GET CREDIT FOR THAT BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT'S BEEN A MONTH SINCE THEN THEN THERE WERE. A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED. AND AND I CAN'T SAY I ASKED THEM OF YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE PERSON ON THE FLOOR BUT WERE ASKED OF YOUR PARTNER. BY ME ABOUT THIS WILL BE PLAN ABOUT CALORIE CYCLE AND PROMISES MADE THAT WE WOULD FIGURE OUT THE SENSES BEFORE THIS BILL CAME BEFORE ME AGAIN AND I SAID OKAY I'M GONNA SEE. SB FIFTY FOUR NATURAL RESOURCES I SAID ON THAT COMMITTEE SAID CAN YOU MAKE SURE SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS ARE. ARE ANSWERED BEFORE I COME SEE ME THERE AND NOT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR. IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SO YOU WEREN'T PRIVY TO THAT CONVERSATION THAT'S A CONVERSATION I HAD WILL DOUBLE TIES WITH. YOUR WITH YOUR JOIN NOT THERE I MISS MISS GONZALEZ ABOUT THIS BILL -- INTO THAT'S FOR SOME OF MY FRUSTRATION STEMS FROM -- AND SO I I I WANT TO MAKE THAT COMMENT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I HAVE COSTLY TOLL FOLKS THIS BILL IS GOING. TO KEEP MOVING AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE LEGISLATION -- ALONG THE WAY AND SO I DO HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BASED AYE WAIT WHERE YOUR BILL IS THAT RIGHT NOW. AND SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT CAL RECYCLE AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE HERE. TO TALK ABOUT THE BILL. AND SO WE ARE WE ARE GIVING A LOT OF POWER TO COVER CYCLE AND I'M FINE WITH THAT AGENCY I DON'T HAVE TOO MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM -- BUT MY QUESTION IS ARE THE ENGAGE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ENGAGE IN THAT IN THAT THEY WERE GIVING THE ADMINISTRATION CAL RECYCLE BY DEFAULT. ALL THIS POWER TO FIGURE FIGURE OUT A NEED TO SENSE HOW. IN SO WHERE ARE THEY IN THE PROCESS WHERE THEY'RE NOT HERE. IT'S BEEN YEAH THIS IS. WHEN YOU TALK TO THEIR THEIR PEOPLE INDUSTRIES VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND I THINK THEY -- THEY SEE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS AS A YOU KNOW AS AS AN APPROACH THAT'S GONNA HELP TO ADDRESS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE -- IT DOES AS YOU KNOW [inaudible] MINISTRATIONS -- OF TODAY AND PAST HAVE ALWAYS BEEN -- LEARY ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITHIN THE KIND OF THE GRAND BUREAUCRACY HAVE BEEN LEERY TO WEIGH IN. HI TO FORCEFULLY ON BILLS I WILL SAY THAT -- I PERSONALLY ENCOURAGE COLLEAGUES AND I ENCOURAGE YOU. TO DO THE SAME SOME MEMBER -- TO TO TO TO TALK TO AND I CAN FACILITATE THE CALL TO YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY ME AND CALLED. ARE THE HEAD OF THE KELLY PA -- OR OTHERS -- PERSONALLY AND TALK ABOUT BOTH YOUR CONCERNS YOUR YOUR YOUR HOPES YOUR FEARS YOUR AMBITIONS YOUR DREAMS FOR THIS BILL AND THE PLAN IN PLACE HERE. I WANT THEM TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM MY COLLEAGUES LIKE YOU. ABOUT HOW SERIOUSLY ND HOW HOW THOUGHTFUL YOU'RE TAKING THIS DECISION. HI HOW YOU SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WERE GIVING A THIRTY TWO CALIBER CYCLE IN THIS BILL. AND THEY REALLY NEED YOU NEED TO HEAR FROM THE LEADERSHIP THAT THEY'RE TAKING OWNERSHIP THAT THEY ARE THEY THEY THEY THEY HEAR THE SORTS OF CONCERNS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING VOICED BY MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY AND THAT AND THAT THAT THEY THAT THEY THEY MAKE COMMITMENTS TO YOU -- THAT THE THE THE SORTS OF THE SORT OF IMPLEMENTATION YOU LIKE TO SEE WILL BE WILL BE WILL BE RESPECTED -- BY THEM WHEN IT WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TIME TO TO TO ROLLING OUT THIS PROCESS I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I I REALLY ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS I'M CERTAINLY HAVING THEM -- WITH WITH WITH FOLKS OVER THERE -- BUT I I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THE SAME BECAUSE I I REALLY DO THINK YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR UPS RIGHT THIS GIVES. THIS IS IT THIS IS A THIS IS A THIS IS THIS IS. RELYING ON THEM. A GREAT DEAL AND WE NEED TO WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEARING FROM YOU AND OTHERS. AND TAKING OWNERSHIP. BUT THIS IS NOT MY BILL AND SO KIND OF LIKE ASKING ME TO HELP YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK -- AND FILL MY PART OF DOING MY PART IS IN THIS COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW AS I SEE THE BILLING GIVING INPUT TO THINGS THAT I WOULD. LIKE TO SEE AND HAVING A BILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ABOUT CARRY CYCLE IN THEM AND MINISTRATION AGREEING TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS NOW. MAKES ME REALLY WARY I'M GONNA VOTE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY BECAUSE THE DISCUSSION YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE THIS IMPORTANT. AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE ITS IMPORTANCE BUT I HAVE LOTS OF OTHER PRIORITIES THAT I'M WORKING ON MY OWN ALREADY WHY I'M CALLING CAL EPA. ON A REGULAR BASIS ABOUT THINGS LIKE P. FOSS EXIDE ARSENIC AND ALL THE OTHER GREAT TOXICS BUT I MY BACKYARD. SO I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE WORK THAT YOU DO HERE BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE CONSTITUENTS IN MY BACKYARD THAT ARE TRACKING THIS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM. SO I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT COMMENT AS LIKE YOU KNOW MINIMIZING YOUR WORK HERE. BUT I I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING HE THAT KEEPS JUST BOTHERING ME IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD -- AS I LOOK AT THE BILL I ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS WERE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN HERE WE HAVE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS CARRY CYCLE TO INCREASE THE RATE BEYOND 75%. YEAH AND I ASK MYSELF THE QUESTION OF WHY ARE WE ALLOWING THAT TO DECREASE IT IF IT'S IF IT'S DEEMED CELL IN THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM ALL THIS POWER. WHY ARE WE NOT GIVEN THE POWER IN BOTH DIRECTIONS UP OR DOWN -- FOR FOR THAT FOR THAT RATE -- IN SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS WE TALK ABOUT GIVING THEM POWER BUT GIVING THEM ENOUGH POWERS AT THE FLEXIBLE I WILL SAY MY EXPERIENCE IT'S COVEY CYCLE. IS THAT IT WILL LIVE I DON'T EVEN EXACTLY TELL ME THAT A LEGISLATION I DON'T DO IT -- AND SO THEY HAVE IN SEVEN YEARS I MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO ME LIKE YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME VERY SPECIFIC AUTHORITY AND SO I THINK THAT IT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM AUTHORITY INCLUDING WITH THE SCHOOL BEHIND AND HOW WE MOVE. WE HAVE TO GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY NOT JUST MOVE THE NUMBER UP BUT IF NEED BE MOVE IT DOWN AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE AND WE DON'T WANT TO CONSIDER THAT. YOU WANT TO BE AMBITIOUS AND WANT TO BE POSITIVE AND HOPEFUL BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO ALLOW FOR BOTH THE UP AND THE DOWN IN YOUR LAN WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE UP. I THINK WE NEED TO INCLUDE THE DOWN IN THERE AS AS THIS MOVE FORWARD IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE CONSIDERED AT ALL YET I I I WOULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER THAT I I AGREE -- THE KEY THING HERE IS FLEXIBILITY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY HI. YEAH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS MEANINGFUL -- I WILL SAY THAT THE BILL. YOU KNOW DOES ULTIMATELY. THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT JUST TALKS ABOUT HOW YOU FOR ANY PACKAGE YOUR PRODUCT IDENTIFIES PRESENTING. THOSE UNIQUE CHALLENGES AS SORT OF UNIQUE CHALLENGES. ARE THE DEPARTMENT SHALL DEVELOP A PLAN TO PHASE OUT PHASE THE PACKAGING OUR PRODUCTS INTO THE REGULATIONS I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S VARIOUS AREAS WHERE THERE'S FLEXIBILITY BUILT IN BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT. ABOUT ABOUT SOME SORT OF WHATEVER SPECIFIC LINGUISTIC Là MY CHAIR YEAH ABOUT IF I COULD I THANK RAMP UP THE NUMBER Y. CONTAINMENT THAT DOWN AS A AS AN IMPLEMENT FERMENTATION AGENCY. I GUESS IF IF IT WERE ON BASED ON SOMETHING. REAL I WOULD. B. THEN THEN THAT THINK OF ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE IF IT'S A MATTER OF OF THEM. BEING LAZY OR YOU KNOW JUST BE YOU CAN HAVING A DISREGARD FOR FOR FOR OUR GOALS THEN I I GUESS I'D BE MORE. UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT BUT I GUESS IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WRITE. THAT RAMP DOWN LANGUAGE -- YOU KNOW IN IN THE RIGHT WAY AND I'M HAPPY TO THINK IT TO THEIR OFFICE ON THAT I I'D BE ABLE TO ABSOLUTELY BUT I THINK YOU WE FEEL THAT CAL WE WE TRUST KILEY CYCLE ENOUGH TO GIVE THE MOST AUTHORITY TO FIGURE OUT ALL THESE NEW SAYS THAT. WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THE ON THE ROAD -- SO LET'S AS THE LEGISLATURE THEN WE HAVE TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROCESS EITHER WAY NOT JUST ONE WAY I FEEL THAT THIS IN JENNY WITH TO SEE WE TRUST YOU OR TRUST TRUST THEM THEIR THEIR DECENT. AS AN AGENCY SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WHEN WE YOU KNOW IT. A TO ME IT JUST FEELS LIKE A BY TRUSTEE THAT I'M INTERESTED THEY GONNA TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO USE THIS OPTION. AS A LAST RESORT MAYBE YOU LAST RESORT BUT AS LONG AS WE AS I WAS AWARDED THE DIRECTION THE RIGHT WAY. YEAH I THINK SO SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR ME AS THIS MOVES FORWARD I DON'T SENATE APPROPRIATIONS I WON'T GET TO SEE THAT THEREBUT TO SOMETHING I HOPE YOU FIGURE OUT BEFORE. APPROPRIATIONS. TAKES THIS BILL UP I ALSO HAVE -- WHAT ELSE IS THE BIG I I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THE FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS THAT ARE -- THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT THERE BY THE OPPOSITION AND SO I THINK YOU FOR THAT -- AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOOD SAFETY THAT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR FOOD WASTE AND THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING MORE FOOD WASTE AS A CONSEQUENCE. ALONG THE WAY -- AND FOR LACK OF A BETTER EXAMPLE OF OF THE FOOD WASTE I THIS IS MAYBE NOT THE BEST EXAMPLE HERE BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING I ENCOUNTER REGULARLY S. I'M EATING. AND BUYING ORGANICS AND THE SHELF LIFE THAT THEY HAVE AND I LIVE BY MYSELF IN SACRAMENTO AND I FIND MYSELF AT THE END OF THE WEEK LIKE. ARE COMING BACK ON MONDAY WITH MY FOOD NOT BEING GOOD ANYMORE RIGHT AND SO I WANT THE ORGANIC STUFF BUT IT'S CREATED THIS TWO WAYS FOR ME ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT I HAVE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO BETTER ABOUT SO FOR LACK OF A BETTER EXAMPLE BUT IT'S A UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO A VERY GOOD DEAL I THINK WE NEED TO BE. TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE FOOD SAFETY PIECES THAT YOU'VE STARTED TO ADDRESS AND STOP I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND GIVE YOU CREDIT. FOR THAT AND THEN THE LAST THING AS I WAS READING THIS THIS BILL -- WAS THE PART ON ENFORCEMENT WITHIN CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE WAS ANY SORT OF ENFORCEMENT OR TEETH. IN AND THIS BILL RIGHT NOW AND I GET THAT THAT MIGHT BE THAT THAT WHILE THEY'RE STILL OPPOSITION AND WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT OTHER IMPORTANT PIECES THAT MIGHT BE THE HARDEST ONE TO FIGURE OUT. BUT I I DO THINK THAT WE NEED SOME SORT OF ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM -- AND IN THIS BILL AT SOME POINT. HOT AND SO THOSE ARE IS THE TERM I AM HOPING SOME VERY SPECIFIC -- SMALL AND BIG THINGS THAT I'M LOOKING AT IN THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD ON INSTEAD OF JUST TELLING YOU FIGURE IT OUT THIS ARE ITEMS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FIGURE IT OUT BEFORE. THE NEXT LIFE OF OF THIS BILL WHICH IS NOT TODAY I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THE LAST THING IS I WANTED AYE I HAD HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE ADVANCE RECYCLE FEE PROPOSAL. ON AND I WILL SAY THAT WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO TELL ME THAT WE WANT TO GIVE YOU MONEY TO GET SOMETHING GOING AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS MARKET GOING BECAUSE IT'S I DON'T UNDER I DON'T WANT THINGS TO BE RECYCLABLE. BUT THEN NO ONE WANTS TO USED TO RECYCLE CONTENT SO -- WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS ADVANCE RECYCLE FEE PROPOSAL AND WHY YOU AREN'T -- AREN'T IT ON THE SUPPORT OF IT BECAUSE I'VE AND NOT SOMETHING THAT THE CHEMISTRY COUNCIL BROUGHT UP. CORRECT. ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YEAH. YEAH -- WE'RE THIS IS PART OF OUR DISCUSSIONS THIS SUMMER -- I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED. TO I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS HOW IT IN A PLACE WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS ARE TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL -- BUT YEAH IT'S ON THE TABLE AND AND WE'RE WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT AND LOOKING AT I MEAN THE REALITY IS THAT DEVELOPING THIS MARKET'S GONNA COST MONEY RIGHT AND WE SEE -- AFTER I'M NOT AND I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT A STORAGE OF COUNSEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY TO COME UP WITH MONEY TO AND THEY HAVEN'T ALL BEEN WORKING AT THE STATE VERY WELL EITHER SO -- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THESE THINGS BECAUSE MONEY WHETHER IT'S FROM A FEE. THAT PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY YOU KNOW PROVIDER FEE WE IMPOSE OR AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR THE GENERAL FUND WHERE WE HAVE GOALS ON ORGANICS OUT THERE WERE HAVING TO PUT ADDITIONAL MONIES. IN FROM OUR GENERAL FUND FROM CAP AND TRADE TO GET THAT MARKET GOING WE KNOW THAT THE MARKET'S GOING TO TAKE SOME REAL MONEY TO DEVELOP. AND SO WHEN I HEAR SOMEONE WANTING TO OFFER AS A HUNDRED MILLION AND WHEN THEY OFF WHEN THEY SAID I WAS LIKE WELL MAYBE WE NEED MORE THAN THAT MAYBE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO OFFER ME CAN YOU OFFER ME MORE. BUT I WILL SAY THAT. IT'S RARE THAT WE HAVE FOLKS COMING OFFERS MANY LIKE THAT TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HELP PAY FOR THIS. YES I DO HOPE WE WE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MONEY WHETHER IT'S THIS IS SOMETHING UP WITH THE SOME POINT. IT IF WE DON'T HAVE THEM PAY FOR THE TAXPAYERS WILL BE PAYING FOR IT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK WE NEED TO START HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS NOW NOT LATER YEAH. YEAH I I I HAVE SO YOU'RE. SO I LOOK FORWARD I HOPE THAT -- YOU DIDN'T GET TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITH ME ON THE FLOOR BUT YOU'RE HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS OF ME NOW SO I HOPE BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT MONTH OF THIS GOING THROUGH A PROCESS OF SPEND. YOU HAVE SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS FOR ME EVEN THOUGH I DON'T SIT ON THAT. COMMITTEE BECAUSE AND I WILL BE LIKE THE I AGREE TEACHER THAT'S LIKE LIKE GIVING YOU AN EXTENSION AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE YOUR HOMEWORK. I THANK YOU AND AND JUST JUST TO SAY ON ON THE ISSUE OF TALKING MINISTRATION I I'M CERTAINLY I AM TALKING THE MINISTRATION AND HAVE DONE -- I I ONLY WAS BRING THAT UP -- BECAUSE YEAH. TO THE EXTENT THAT I I WANT THEM TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS -- TO TO REALLY. I DO THINK IT STRENGTHENS OUR ARE KIND OF COLLECTIVE POWER WITH THESE IF YOU WERE TRYING. BUT I I I TOTALLY I WAS GOT A LOT GOING ON AND AND WANTED THEM TO CONTINUE I WILL CONTINUE TO PASS THESE CONVERSATIONS ON TO THEM AND MANY OF THEM AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE TIME THIS YEAR THIS IS BECOME A TIER BILLS THAT THEY DO HAVE TECH. TO COME TO THE TABLE YOU NEED ON TO THAT QUESTION BUT I THINK OF FAIR QUESTION FOR ME TO PUT OUT THERE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY. THANK YOU A MANAGER JUST A QUICK TECHNICAL QUESTIONS DROWNED. THERE ARE TWO BILLS OF COURSE IT IS IS THAT THOUGHT TO CONTINUE PUSHING THEM. TOGETHER OR IS THERE A NARROWING PROCESS AT SOME POINT. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE IDENTICAL BILLS AND WILL. AND THEY ARE WORK RIGHT DENTICLE THEY ARE YEAH CAM AND WE'RE WE'RE GONNA. RIGHT AWAY RECONCILED AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE JUST IN CLOSE WE'RE CLOSE TOUCH WITH. ASSEMBLY SIDE AND SENATE SIDE WE ARE ARE STAFFERS HAVE BEEN KEY MEETINGS AND WORKING REALLY CLOSELY TOGETHER AND HI IT'S A IT'S A TRULY A JOINT EFFORT. THANK YOU I I'M I'M A CO AUTHOR THIS DOESN'T NO SURPRISE THAT I SUPPORT THIS TODAY WHAT WE HAD A HEARING LAST FALL IT WAS THAT THAT THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THAT THE CHAIR WOMAN AND I SELECT COMMITTEE ON ON WASTE -- TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE IN THE BAY AREA AND JUSTICE IMPACT ON PLASTICS IS IS DINO DUMB FOUNDING TO TO THE AVERAGE. CONSUMER AND ESPECIALLY AS SUMMER EGGMAN TALKED ABOUT -- I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT THE FOR A FEW MONTHS AGO A FEW WEEKS AGO. IF YOU GO TO ANY SCHOOL PROJECT NOW THE KIDS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THIS IS THE TOPIC THEY BRING UP AND YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS EXAMPLE THAT'S WHEN THE SHOW YOU THIS DROWNED. I WENT TO THAT TO THE BEACH OVER THE HOLIDAY BREAK AND WITHIN FIFTEEN SECONDS I WENT DOWN THERE AND I PICKED UP THIS HANDFUL OF MATERIALS OF PLASTICS AND JUST TO TURN AROUND AND TELL PEOPLE AND KIDS IN. THIS IS RIGHT IN THIS THIS CAN'T BE GOOD YEAH RIGHT THIS CAN'T BE GOOD. AND AND EVEN THE INDUSTRY HAS MENTIONED THAT. WERE ON THE SAME PAGE AND WANT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT. OF SINGLE USED TO SCARBOROUGH PLASTICS AND OF COURSE THERE THE IN USE INNING UP AND WATER WAYS WHICH COST CITIES IN JURISDICTIONS A CLEAN UP THE CREEK SO WE HAVE ANNUAL CLICK CREEK. CLEANUP HERE DURING -- DURING THE SPRING AND THE PROJECT ISN'T TO GO IT. AND PULL INVASIVE SPOT WEED SPECIES IT'S THE POORLY POLL PLASTIC OUT OF THE CREEK OF LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT A USE OF TIME -- SO WE WE GET THAT NEED FOR THIS ABSOLUTELY AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE MAYBE IF YOU COULD DO TWO THINGS -- ONE UNDER THE PROSPECT THAT THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL HOPE THIS SUMMER TALK ABOUT. YOUR INVASION OF THIS. TASK FORCE ENTITY -- MAYBE START WITH THAT. THE VISION THE VISION AT THE SCOPING PROCESS EQUAL YOU SAID OVER THE NEXT -- THE NEXT COUPLE YES SO SO WHAT REALISTICALLY DO YOU DO YOU THINK. COULD BE ADDRESSED IN SOMEBODY'S SO WHAT WE HAVE BEGIN -- ISSUES. OUT THERE SO SO WE'VE WHAT WE'VE DONE -- WE HAD A BIG MEETING IN MY OFFICE -- WITH WITH ALSO THE STAKEHOLDERS INDUSTRY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WASTE. AND ENVIRONMENTAL -- RETAIL SIDE MANUFACTURING AS IT WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS AROUND. PACKED THEIR IN THE ROOM. AND THE IDEA NOW IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SET UP -- SMALLER. WE'RE WE'RE BASICALLY BREAKING UP ASPECTS OF THE BILL. AND THEN HAVING -- SMALLER STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ON THOSE VARIOUS TOPICS. AND THAT WAY PEOPLE EITHER THEIR THIRD YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME INDUSTRY GROUP THAT MAYBE JUST IN ONE PARTICULAR PART OF THE BILL THAT IS NEED TO BE THERE FOREVER CIVIL DISCUSSION AND THERE'S SOME OTHER FOLKS MIGHT BE THERE FOR MORE THAN MEETINGS OTHERS -- AND SO -- WE'RE WORD. THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HAPPENING OVER THE NEXT. TWO MONTHS EFFECTIVELY AND AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO SIT DOWN THERE AND AND TRY. TO BANG OUT EVERY EVERY EVERY KIND OF AREA OF CONTENTION AND CONTROVERSY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE I HAD I HAD EVERY ISSUE IN THE END OF THE DAY. THIS IS A BOLD -- BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIG DEAL OF THE WEEK WE DO WANT TO GET IT GET IT RIGHT AND AND I WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY COMMITTED. TO YOU KNOW INTENSE. ALL HANDS ON DECK STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSION -- SOMETIMES IT TAKES. GETTING TOWARD THE END OF THE LINE TO GET PEOPLE TO REALLY START TALKING -- BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE IN. OKAY AND THEN -- SECONDLY. I KNOW THAT -- IF YOU THE BILL HAS A DATE OF TWENTY THIRTY CELL. I LOOK I HAVE YOUR SAME JOB WE HAVE TO THREAD A NEEDLE YET PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS COMPLEX ISSUE IN IN YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO. WANT TO GET RID OF THIS -- TODAY OR TOMORROW AND THEY DON'T WANT TO WAIT TILL TWENTY THIRD -- YEAH YEAH AND THEN -- FROM THEM YEAH IN THE INDUSTRY. THAT -- YOU LOOK AT THE AT THE THE WEATHER IS READILY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY TO DEAL WITH SOME ISSUES LIKE FOOD AND PROCESSING AND CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SO. SO HEY HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU REASSURE -- BOTH SIDES THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT THE GOALS. WASTE REDUCTION AND HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S ACHIEVABLE TO THE INDUSTRY AND BASICALLY THE CONSUMER SO IT'S NOT GOING TO UPSET THE APPLE CART TOO MUCH AS FAR AS YEAH. WHAT CONSUMERS DO NOT TAKE BROWN A REALLY BASIS BY FOOD BY PRODUCTS BY? YOU KNOW. WHAT HAVE YOU RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHY THE BILL REALLY SEEKS TO BE FLEXIBLE YOU KNOW IT THE? EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT INSTEAD OF I MEAN I I I HEARD THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE LEGISLATING ABOUT WHAT ABOUT MORE LEGISLATING ASIAN AND AND MANY LIVES OF USER NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT I HAVE I MEAN I'M SURE THE FROM A CALL THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE SEEN A COUPLE BILLS. THAT HAVE BEEN VERY PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA DRESS A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE. AND VERY PRESCRIPTIVE GOING WAY OUT IN THE FUTURE. AND ONE OF THINGS WE STRUGGLED WITH WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE BILLS WAS THE QUESTION OF WELL YOU KNOW. TECHNOLOGY CHANGES I MEAN YOU YOU KNOW. WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGINED DID TWENTY YEARS AGO WE WOULD ALL BE WALKING AROUND WITH THE COMPUTER IN OUR POCKETS THE SIZE OF THE? YOU KNOW THE COMPUTER THAT BROUGHT THE FIRST MAN TO THE MOON -- IT THINGS CHANGE NEEDS CHANGE OUR ISSUES CHANGE AND AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WITH WITH THIS BILL WAS PROVIDE ADEQUATE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT. I'VE AS THE WORLD CHANGES AND PERHAPS DRAMATICALLY OF NEXT FIVE TEN TWENTY YEARS THERE WILL BE AT LEAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS -- THERE WERE THERE WILL BE YEAH -- ANY AGENCY THAT AND AND STAY IN THIS THIS CONTINUING PROCESS WHEREBY PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE. TO TO RECALIBRATE AND TWEAK AND CHANGE. ON UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH THAT THAT REALLY ARE ARE SO. THEY'RE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AND THEY'RE VERY MUCH BASED ON OUR CURRENT. THINKING ABOUT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS. AND SO -- FLEXIBILITY IS THE KEY WITH WITH KIND OF A A STRONG SET OF OF GOALS IN MIND. AND THAT'S THAT'S I THINK WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE OF THE BILL NOW I YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BILL SO STRONG I I ALSO YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF THE QUESTIONS WE JUST GOT TODAY. THE FLEXIBILITY LEADS TO A CERTAIN CONCERN OVER VAGUENESS SORT FOR OUR LACK OF SPECIFICITY THAT WE'VE WE'VE GRAPPLED WITH AS THE BILL'S MAYBE MEETS WAY THROUGH. THE MORE SPECIFICITY WE PUT IN. THE MOREWE MAY BE TYING THE HANDS OF THE PROCESS IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO BOTH THE BARBELL SIDE OR THE OR INDUSTRY -- AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE RELUCTANT -- TO YOU KNOW. TO TO TO TO TO TAKE AWAY THE FLEXIBILITY MORE THAN WE'VE WITH THEM WITH THAT WE THAT WE NEED. TO THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH. THANK YOU FOR FONG. THANK YOU AS AS A FILLING IN AYE AYE AYE AYE BUDGET IS ALREADY BEEN ASKED BUT I WAS WONDERING IF -- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS BILL COSTS IMPLEMENT FORCE THE ESTIMATE OVER IN A PROBES WITH SHOWING THREE THREE POINT. THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION -- OVER THE LIFE CYCLE. OF THE BILL IS THE ESTIMATE THAT WE GOT FROM APPROPRIATIONS. THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION YEAH. OVER THE THE A PER YEAR NO NO NO -- TOTAL [inaudible] YEAH. IN TOTAL THE TOTAL SO THAT'S INCLUDING PERSONNEL COSTS AND EVERYTHING THAT AND AND TO EXECUTE EVERYTHING YEAH THE THE THE CONTRACT THAT THE THE PLENTY OF THE SCOPING PLAN THAT IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU YEAH. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ACTUALLY JUST HAVE ONE KIND OF FOLLOW UP WITH SOME WOMAN EGGMAN'S QUESTION -- ON THE SCOPING PLAN IF THAT'S NOT DONE BY TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE FIRST REGULATION. IS SUPPOSED TO GO AND PUT IN EFFECT IN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF THAT PLAN IS NOT IN PLACE DOES THAT AUTOMATICALLY PUSH THOSE NUMBERS BACKED. WE GET SOME CLARITY ON EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS IF THE PLAN IS NOT IN PLACE. YEAH RIGHT YEAH I'M SO THE BILL SAYS IT DID THIS CALL VOTE HAS TO BE IN PLACE. FOR THE RAGS TO KICK AND SO -- THERE'S NOT A MECHANISM FOR THEM TO KICKING WITHOUT THE SCOPING PLANNED PROCESS HAVING BEEN HAVEN'T FINALIZED. SO THAT'S THAT IS IN THE BILL. I AM NOW THE THE SHE WAS ASKING ABOUT WHETHER THERE BE SOME SORT OF LIKE. GAP IN TIME AFTER THAT SCOOBY PLAN IS FINISHED IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION. AND THAT THE BILL DOES NOT SPECIFY BUT BUT BUT THE THE REX CAN'T GO INTO EFFECT IN LESS THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS IS COMPLETE. WITH DISCOVERED PLANS DONE IN DECEMBER. AND JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ROLLS AROUND WE TALK WE HAVE A MONTH TIME FRAME THAT TO PUT ALL THIS IN PLACE. NO I MEAN THE THE THE MEMBER MEMBER FIRST OF ALL IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TOWARD. TWENTY THIRTY ODD. TO BE TO BE HONEST I'M SURE IF IF YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TALK SHOP ABOUT HOW WE CAN LIKE. IT SURE AT YOU KNOW A SMOOTHER TIME FRAME LIKE DELINEATING THE LOSSES HERE BECAUSE I'M I'M SURE WE CAN WORK THIS OUT I THIS IS. VISIT DIVERT TO THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES PROJECT. IT MAY BE BUT FOR OUR INDUSTRY THE FOLK FOR THOSE OF US IN ACT I PACKAGING IN THOSE THINK IT'S A BIG CONCERN OF OURS IS ALSO I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON IT WILL BE IN TOUCH HAPPY TALK ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU BRING THIS FORWARD INTO THIS IS BEEN A LARGE PART OF YOUR WORK IS WORKING ON THIS BILL. I FOR ONE APPRECIATE THE ART THE WAY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TACKLE THIS WHICH IS BY GIVING. GOALS THAT VAN GIVE THE AGENCIES FLEXIBILITY AS TO AND THE INDUSTRY AS TO HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS RATHER THAN BEING PRESCRIPTIVE. IT'S THE SAME TACK THAT WAS TAKING WITH SB THIRTY TWO AND IT'S WORKED EXTREMELY WELL BETTER THAN WE HAD EVER PLAN BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE WAYS THE CURSOR MATT. I'M KIND OF LIKE -- SB THIRTY TWO I ALSO. LOOK AT THE IMPACTS THAT PLASTICS HAVE HAD IN OUR ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW BOTH IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW TO OUR OCEANS WHICH IS REALLY HIT DRASTIC LEVELS AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN DENIAL ABOUT THE EFFECTS THAT THAT'S HAVING. BUT THEY'RE HAVING INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE A FAX AND IF WE DON'T HAVE AN OCEAN WITH ON THE PLANET -- THE FACT THAT NOW THERE'S PLASTICS DETECTABLE IN PEOPLE'S BLOOD. IN THE BLOOD OF UNBORN FETUSES WITH AND WE DON'T KNOW THE HEALTH IMPACT ABOUT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW PLASTICS ARE POWERFUL ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF AND FOOD SAFETY WELL I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE'S MORE SAFETY FROM HAVING CLASSICS AROUND FOOD THAN AROUND NOT HAVING PLASTICS AROUND FOOD. AND THAT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE CLEAR. SO GIVEN ALL OF THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT PLASTICS IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN AS A HAZARD HAZARDOUS PRODUCT. AND IT'S A HAZARDOUS PRODUCT TO OUR PLANET. THAT HAS BEEN DUMPED INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT'S THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEALING WITH IT. AND RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE A HUGE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE WITH THE PLASTICS THAT COME INTO THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE SO FAR THE MANUFACTURERS IN THE INDUSTRY HAS REALLY DONE VERY LITTLE. TO HELP OFFSET THE INCREDIBLE EXPENSE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE IN. THE FACT OR TAXPAYERS HAVE AS THEY PAY FOR THEIRS THERE WERE THERE. ARE TRASH. FEES WHICH NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO UP AND UP AND UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS TOXIC MATERIAL AND DEAL WITH TRYING TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE WATER WAYS IN THOSE OF US WHO WORK. ON RIVERS AND HAVE STORM DRAINS THAT DRAIN INTO THE OCEAN OUR PERSONALLY HAVING YOU KNOW THE THE CITIES HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT. AND THE COMMUNITIES HAVE TO PAY FOR THE CLEAN UP IN THE IMPACT OF LITTER SO THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS IMPACTS. AND THE INDUSTRY HAS HAD MANY YEARS TO DEAL WITH THIS THEY'VE HAD. DOT YOU KNOW DOZENS AND DOZENS OF YEARS AND YET WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY REAL MEANING. FOR MOVEMENT IN FACT IT'S GONE THE OTHER DIRECTION AS ASIAN DOESN'T WANT PLASTICS DUMPED ON THEM. WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PLASTICS THAT ARE COMING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT MY GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE MORE MORE PLASTICS BEING FORCED ON ME AS A CONSUMER OF FOOD OR OTHER PRODUCTS. WHEN WE GET OUR LITTLE PINS YOU KNOW THAT WE GET ALL THE TIME UP HERE FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS THERE MORE MORE THEY'RE WRAPPED IN PLASTIC FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON? SO I DON'T SEE AN INDUSTRY THAT'S TAKEN MUCH RESPONSIBILITY% BUT I SEE THESE INCREDIBLY HARMFUL EFFECTS OF THIS PRODUCT WE DIDN'T ASK WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE DON'T ASK THE COAL INDUSTRY TO BE AT THE TABLE WITH US WITH AT WITH SB. THIRTY TWO WE SAID THESE AREGOALS USUALLY THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. AND YOU GUYS GO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT AND ASKING THEM TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND CREATE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY TO REDUCE WASTE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. NOT JUST GIVE US PRODUCTS THAT ARE. CONCEPTUALLY RECYCLABLE IN OUR LABORATORY BUT SAYING WE WANT THOSE PRODUCTS TO BE RECYCLED PRODUCTS SO THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S SUSTAINABLE OR ELSE YOU CAN'T SELL THEM IN OUR STATE. AND THAT'S THE GOALS THAT WE SHOULD BE SETTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE AND THEN THERE THE MANUFACTURERS YOU GUYS GO FIGURE IT OUT WITH CAL RECYCLABLE WE CAN'T BE SITTING UP HERE IN FIGURING THAT OUT. BUT THE TRADE OFF IS IF WE DON'T DO IT LARA READY IN A CRISIS. YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER SIX YEARS OLD ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT SHE'S SUPPOSED TO FIGURE THIS OUT TEN TWENTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. NO WE HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT NOW AND YOU HAVE TO BE AT THE TABLE FINANCIALLY AND EVERY OTHER WAY BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE TO HARMFUL PRODUCT. INTO ONTO OUR PLANET. AND WE'RE TO CRISIS LEVEL SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN PASS THIS FAST ENOUGH DEVELOP THE REGULATIONS FAST ENOUGH I WORRY THAT THIS IS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. SO I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOU WORKING WITH THEM TO GET TO WHERE THEY'RE SATISFIED WITH THIS BILL OR FINDING A WAY FOR CAL RECYCLE TO GIVE LESS. MINIMUM CONTENT IN THESE PRODUCTS I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE THAT THEY DESERVE A LOT BETTER. SO DO WE HAVE A MOTION. BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED WOULD YOU. WE NEED A SECOND FROM SOMEONE. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB MANAGER. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND AND I MEAN YOU I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD AND YOU THE DAY. ALL THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FEASIBILITY WORKABILITY -- BUT A NEW DAY WE'VE GOT AN ENORMOUS CRISIS ON OUR HANDS I APPRECIATE YOU BRING US BACK TO THE THE REASONS WHY WE'RE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE -- AND THAT'S FOR YOU KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER MY SIGN IN AND AND AND AND AND AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THAT WE GIVE THEM A SHOT. AT AT CUT BEING ABLE. TO ADDRESS THIS ENORMOUS INFRASTRUCTURAL. AND TOXIC PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. AND AT AT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING A GLOBAL PROBLEM AND I HOPE THAT WILL BE REALLY PROUD OF WHAT WE DO HERE TODAY. THANK YOU AND HAVE A WE HAVE A MOTION ALL SECOND IT.

FIVE WHICH IS OF COURSE AS WE KNOW INDIGENOUS TO MATCH LAND I SUPPORT ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION SEVEN IN THE GREEN YOU DEAL AS THERE'S NOTHING MORE EXCITING THAN AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS FINALLY COME. AMONG THE GROUPS OF PEOPLE MOST IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE OUR FARMERS AND FARM WORKING COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE MUSIC WERE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE THOMAS AND WAS THE FIRES. OF INTER IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE OF OUR ECOLOGICAL ADDRESS ALLOWS US TO REMAIN RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHAOS BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING WITH NATURE AND NOT AGAINST IT. WE WANT TO BUILD UPON THIS KNOWLEDGE AND SHARE IT WITH OTHERS WERE SOLVING PLANETARY LEVEL PROBLEMS BY INCREASING OUR SOILS WATER AND CARBON CAPTURING CAPACITY. THE REGENERATIVE FORMS OF AGRICULTURE AND THE APPLICATION OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT -- AND I PM APPROACH WHICH IS PREFERRED METHOD OF SCIENTISTS REGULATORS AND PRACTITIONERS ALIKE -- HISTORICALLY LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ON VETS MINUTES BEEN DEDICATED TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF FEEDING A FUTURE WITH A MUCH LARGER POPULATION BUT HAVING LESS. LAND IN ORDER TO DO SO THIS IS WHY WE NEED THE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN CONGRESS TO PURSUE POLICIES UNDER THE GREEN YOU DEAL THE BILL THE FINE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE ACTIONS FOR TOO LONG. OUR CURRENT CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM OF FOOD AND FIBER PRODUCTION HAS BEEN THE ANSWER PETROCHEMICAL BASED PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS RELEASE HARMFUL LEVELS GREENHOUSE GASES THAT CONTAINED CONTAMINATE THE AIR WATER AND SOIL OVER PLANTS PEOPLE ON PLANET. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS AN EXTRACT OF ONE WE MIND THE SOIL FOR NUTRIENTS WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK FARFOR THE SOLUTION WE NEED TO LOOK DOWN THE SOLUTION IS RIGHT UNDER FEET. IN THIS CASE SEVERAL FEET -- THIS WAS A SOLUTION OVER 90% OF THE FOOD WE EAT COME FROM IT SO IF YOU EAT YOUR IN YOU GET IT. HUNDREDS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS LONG WITH SIX IN A NATIONAL BODIES CONVENE BY THE WORLD BANK CONFIRM THIS THEY CONCLUDE THAT ARE EXTRACTIVE PATRICK CHEMICAL SYSTEM OF FARMING IS NO LONGER SUSTAINABLE. THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT MORE BIODIVERSE REGENERATIVE LOCALLY FOCUS FARMING SYSTEMS ARE ACTUALLY MORE PRODUCTIVE PER UNIT -- THESE ARE SYSTEMS THAT CAN TRULY SEE THE WORLD. ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION SEVEN WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON WHAT THE STATE IS ALREADY DOING CALIFORNIA'S IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS SUCH AS A HEALTHY SOLD PROGRAM WHICH WE AT THE BEEN TAPE WERE TAKING PART IN.

Là MON I MATHIS [inaudible] MCCARTY. WHERE? THIRTY STONE. SO. NINE FIVE TWO FIVE TWO TWO WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH TAKING A CHAIR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] SENATOR LABOR [inaudible] WELCOME. YOU ARE HERE WITH SB TWO TEN I AM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TO YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL IS MUCH APPRECIATED. MEMBERS SB TWO TEN ESTABLISHES A SMOG CHECK REQUIREMENT FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WILL APPLY SIMILAR RESPONSIBILITIES TO TRUCK OPERATORS TO MAINTAIN THEIR EMISSION CONTROLS AS WE ALREADY REQUIRE OF THE CALLER CARS THAT WE ALL DRIVE EVERY DAY. UNLIKE PERSONAL PASSENGER VEHICLES CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS EVERY OTHER SMOG CHECKS TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE MISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING PROPERLY DRIVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ROADS ANNUALLY. AND ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THE STATE'S POOR AIR QUALITY. STATEWIDE NEARLY TWELVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT FAIL TO MEET FEDERAL CLEAN AIR STANDARDS HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OPERATING CALIFORNIA ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 60%. OF THE HARMFUL KNOCKS 82% OF DIESEL PM TO FIVE A POTENTIALLY CAUGHT CANCER CAUSING AIR CONTAMINANT. MEMBERS THIRTY YEAR COST CALIFORNIA OVER TWENTY BILLION AND HOSPITALIZATIONS VISITS TO EMERGENCY ROOMS AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES THE CONSEQUENCES ARE MUCH WORSE IN CERTAIN REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE. LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH ARE GREATLY AFFECTED BY LARGE TRUCK TRAFFIC IN CONGESTED FREEWAYS. DESPITE THE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE TO SUPPORT A TRANSITION. TWO ZERO AND NEAR ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES DIESEL TRUCKS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE ON OUR ROADS FOR DECADES TO COME WE HAVE TO TAKE THE BOLD STEP OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR MISSION CONTROLS. THROUGHOUT THE TRUCKS LIFESPAN THIS SECTION ALONE WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. OVER THE NEXT DECADE SB TWO TEN WILL ASSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED TONS OF HARMFUL PARTICULATE MATTER EQUIVALENT TO TAKING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TRUCKS. OFF THE ROAD NOT ONLY WILL SB TWO TEN HELP INSURE PUBLIC HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. AS BECAUSE THEY BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY MAINTAINED THIS BILL ALSO APPLIES TO OUT OF STATE TRUCKS I WILL HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR A LAW ABIDING CALIFORNIA TRUCK OWNERS AND OPERATORS. SIMPLY PUT TO TEN WILL BE A WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS I'VE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO BRING FORWARD A BALANCED MAJOR THE ADVANCES CLEAN AIR AND CORPORATE INDUSTRY INPUT. WITH THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MOVED TO NEUTRAL INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION AND CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE OF SHARED IMPORTANCE. AS THEY TOO WANT THE STATE TO FAIRLY ENFORCE VEHICLE STANDARDS ANIMATION LAWS. I REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH INDUSTRY AND CLEAR CLEAN AIR ADVOCATES IN ORDER TO CREATE A BALANCED AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THIS INCLUDES WORKING TO ENSURE THAT VEHICLES HAVE A REASONABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE PATH TOWARDS COMPLIANCE SB TWO TEN IS SUPPORTED BY DOZENS OF IMAC FIRE MENTAL HEALTH AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION ORGANIZATIONS. HERE WITH ME TODAY BILL MCGOVERN POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE COALITION OF CLEAN AIR AND MEREDITH ALEXANDER POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CAL START THANK YOU. MANAGER MEMBERS ON BILL THE GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR CLEAN AIR WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CENTER LEYVA ON THIS BILL FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS NOW BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE TO AIR QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I AM SURE THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD ACTUALLY BE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS NO. CURRENTLY SMOG CHECK PROGRAM FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS THE WAY THAT THERE IS FOR CARS AND LIGHT TRUCKS BECAUSE ACTUALLY. MORE THE POLLUTION COMES FROM THOSE TRUCKS THAN IT DOES FROM THE CARS YET WE REQUIRE CARS WHEN THEY REACH A CERTAIN AGE TO GO IN AND GET SMOG BUT THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS RUNNING ON DIESEL FUEL AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INSPECTION MAINTENANCE IS THAT TESTS HAVE SHOWN THAT. A LOT OF THESE TRUCKS ARE ACTUALLY HAVING EMISSIONS THAT ARE SEVERAL TIMES HIGHER THAN THE EMISSIONS THAT THE ENGINES ARE CERTIFIED. TO SO IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A TRUCK A BE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ENGINE OF A CERTAIN VINTAGE TO HAVE A DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTER BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO ACTUALLY GO IN AND CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT THE EMISSIONS ARE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. AND THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN CLAIMING THAT THEY'RE ALREADY REGULATED FOR THIS PURPOSE WELL THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE AN INSPECTION MAINTENANCE PROGRAM -- NOBODY DOES CURRENTLY BEYOND THE CHECK FOR VISIBLE SMOKE. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY ALREADY PART OF THE STATE'S PLAN FOR COMING INTO ATTAINMENT WITH FEDERAL AIR QUALITY GUIDELINES -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLEAN UP THE SMOG IN PARTICULAR POLLUTION THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM AROUND THE STATE THERE'S A LOT WE NEED TO DO TO CLEAN UP DIESEL POLLUTION. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE AND PROBABLY THE LONGEST OVERDUE PIECE SO -- WE THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND HOPE THAT YOU'LL PROVE THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRIEDMAN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MEREDITH ALEXANDER AND I'M HERE AND THE POLICY DIRECTOR CAL STAR. CAL START AS A CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM FOCUSED ON GROWING THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY AND OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS -- TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS INCLUDING FLEET SUCH AS UPS AND FEDEX LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER NON PROFITS. SO MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AS YOU KNOW ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR FREIGHT SYSTEM WHICH IS A MAJOR ENGINE FOR OUR STATE'S ECONOMY HOWEVER THERE THEY ALSO LIMITED DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. OUR MEMBERS WERE CONFIDENT MAINTAIN THEIR FLEETS RESPONSIBLY TO ENSURE THEIR IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS HOWEVER SOME FLEETS ARE GROSS POLLUTERS TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTH. AND IT'S ACTUALLY CURRENT CREATES A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR THE FLEET TO HAVE RESPONSIBLE WELL MAINTAINED EQUIPMENT. THE CURRENT LACK OF SMOG CHECKS EQUATES TO AN UNFAIR TAX ON THOSE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES AN UNFAIR TAX ON OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS LONGS. SB TWO TEVIN WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD ACROSS COMMERCIAL TRUCK OPERATORS BY ENSURING THAT EVERYONE IS HELD TO THESAME STANDARD. AND THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HELP MANY FLEETS BY STOPPING THOSE LOWER AND OPERATORS -- FROM UNDER CUTTING MORE PROFESSIONAL MORE WELL MAINTAINED OPERATIONS. THIS BILL IS DONE IN A SENSIBLE WAY AND IS MEANT TO BE A LIGHT TOUCH SYSTEM EVEN LIGHTER TOUCH THAN OUR CURRENT VEHICLE SMOG CHECKS. IMPORTANTLY IT SENDS OUT A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR FLEETS THAT HAVING A STEP ESTABLISH COMPLIANCE HISTORY WHICH ADDRESSES SOME OF THE OTHER CONCERNS REGARDING THE BILL. AND OBVIOUSLY CAR WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE TO DETERMINE THE DETAILS AND PROCESS THROUGH A FULL RULE MAKING WITH FULL STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION. SO NO FLEET OPERATORS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CIRCUMVENT STATE VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS AND SB TWO TEN WILL ENSURE PARITY ACROSS ALL INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. AND IN SOME THE BILL PROVIDES VERY WORKABLE APPROACH TO TAMPING DOWN ON GROSS POLLUTERS WHILE AVOIDING UNNECESSARY RED TAPE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU WITNESSES AN OFFICER IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON NO -- CREAMERS OF THE CAL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE. PARAMETERS IN PLACE THAT WILL ALLOW. THE TRUCKS THAT AGRICULTURAL. THAT OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY DID DEPEND UPON TO REMAIN AVAILABLE. AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE WHICH PROVIDE. TRUCKS USED EXCLUSIVELY IN AGRICULTURE TO HAVE SEVENTY FIVE DAYS FOR REPAIRS SO WHAT COULD HAPPEN IS. A TRUCK HAULING TOMATO SAY IF THAT CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES IN COMES ON AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TOMATO HARVEST. UNDER THE FORTY FIVE DAY REQUIREMENT GIVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME THIS IS THAT IT HITS TAKING TO GET REPAIRS RIGHT NOW. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE PULLED FROM USE AND THAT TRUCK WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO HELP HARVEST THOSE TOMATOES. SO THE SEVENTY FIVE DAYS WILL MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS AREN'T LEFT ROTTING IN THE FIELDS ULTIMATELY SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE SEVENTY FIVE DAY LENGTH FOR THAT. THE ONE REMAINING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IS HOW DO WE DEAL WITH TRUCKS THAT ARE. COMPLYING WITH THE TRUCK AND BUS RULE UNDER THE LOW USE PROVISIONS OF THE DRIVING UNDER THOUSAND MILES OR THOSE THAT ARE LICENSED A SPECIAL EQUIPMENT. BOTH OF THOSE IF THEY ARE FORCED. TO DRIVE THOSE TRUCKS TO A FACILITY TO GET TESTEDCOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THEIR SPECIAL EQUIPMENT LICENSE AND REGISTRATION OR THEY COULD. NO LONGER BE COMPLIANT WITH THE TRUCK AND BUS ROLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOW DRIVING OVER A THOUSAND MILES AND SO UP WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO TRY TO FIND A SOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TRUCKS. I'M CAN GET TESTED ON SITE RATHER THAN HAVING TO DRIVE THOSE VEHICLES -- AND ONCE THAT AMENDMENT IS TAKEN AND WE COULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION CAN I WOULD JUST SAY THAT'S OUR GOAL TO IS TO DO ON SITE TESTING. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. A FAD THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT JUST NEGATE ANYTHING I SAY RIGHT THERE -- THE MICROBES YEAR ON BEHALF THE COVERING USUALLY CHILES ASSOCIATION REALLY -- MAIN THING ONE USE CLARIFY FOR THE SIERRA CLUB WHAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING AND IF I HAVEN'T BEEN SAYING IT CORRECTLY AND OTHER HEARINGS I APOLOGIZE. THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES. HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE REGULATED BY CAR RIGHT NOW UNDER SOMETHING CALLED THE FLEET REGULATION FOR PUBLIC UTILITIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES I HAVEN'T MET TO INFER THAT THAT MEANS THAT THEY RARELY GET REGULATED TO THE SAME RIGOROUS -- SMOG CHECK PROGRAM AS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL BUT THEY ARE REGULATED IN AND AND THEIR WILLINGLY REGULATED AND THEY DO -- PATSY TESTING ON SITE WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WANTING -- IN THIS BILLS TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC UTILITIES TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ON SITE TESTING BY THEIR POPE BY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND USING WHATEVER EQUIPMENT IS NEEDED TO DO THAT IS IT'S DETERMINED BY CARBON THEIR SMOG CHECK FOR IN THIS NEW SMOG CHECK PROGRAM. THAT'S THE MAIN AMEND THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEKING IN IN THIS BILL THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE BROUGHT UP ANOTHER COMMITTEE HEARINGS THE CAN GET CLARIFIED PROBABLY MORE LIKELY IN THE FISCAL COMMITTEE ON DEALING MAKING SURE THAT -- FEES ARE BEING PAID BY OUT OF STATE TRUCK DRIVERS AND THAT WE'RE NOT SUBSIDIZING THE COMPLIANCE COSTS ABOUT STATE TRUCK DRIVERS BUT OTHERWISE I THINK -- THE AUTHORS COVERED MY CONCERN THANK YOU WE'RE GETTING THERE. THANK YOU -- ANYONE ELSE WHO -- WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. JUST A TWEENER HERE I HAVEN'T MET ROOM WITH COPPER TRUCKING ASSOCIATION -- WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE WE BELIEVE THAT GOES A LONG WAY TO ENSURING THAT THERE'S PROPER -- OVERSIGHT OVER THE PROGRAM AND THAT THE AUTHORITY REMAINS WITH THE LEGISLATURE NOT DELEGATED TO THE AGENCY THANK. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FEELS INCONVENIENCE ALLIANCE WE REPRESENT 95%. OF THE FUEL MARKETERS AND COMMON CARRIERS THAT DELIVER FUEL IN THE STATE -- DEFINITELY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THE BILL AND SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT'S BEEN PUT INTO THE BILL. I THINK GIVEN OUR PAST EXPERIENCES WITH CAR WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE -- LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TAKEN PRIOR TO THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM GOING INTO PLACE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS REMAIN OPPOSED THANKS. YES THE RIVER IN CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PERIMENOPAUSE LISTEN AMENDED FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY MY COLLEAGUE AT THE FARM BUREAU. ANTHONY CAN HELP CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING SPECIAL DISTRICTS WHICH ARE PUBLIC AGENCIES. OPPOSE UNLESS A MAN AND A LINE OUR COMMENTS WITH IN IN MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING KURT BLACK AND I HAVE THE WESTERN STATES TRUCKING ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL TO GET UP TO THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN. THANK YOU SO THAT THOSE ARE SOME MY CONCERNS YES AS A SOMEBODY WHO STAND. TRY TO AVOID THOSE CHECKPOINTS AS MUCH AS HE COULD WE DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT A WHOLE SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING -- TO DOING ALL THE TIME AVOIDING THINGS THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE WORKING WE OPPOSITION AND YOU ARE DETERMINED. TO GET THERE BUT BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR YES WE REALLY ARE AND WE YOU KNOW CARP WILL THEY WANT ALSO TO HAVE THESE MOBILE TESTING UNITS. SO WE JUST DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE THE DETAILS BUT THAT'S EVERYONE'S GOAL. WITH THAT I I WILL MOVE THE BALL AND MEN. LOOKS LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO WHEN I GUESS THE FLOOR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION -- IT HAS TO DO WITH US SEVENTY TWO DAY -- FIX IT ENFORCEMENT SEVENTY TWO OR SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY SORRY SEVENTY FIVE DAY FIX THE TICKET SO. DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU I DIDN'T SEE IN THE BILL ANYTHING THAT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF FIX THE TICKETS THAT CAN BE ISSUED SO IF. AN AG USER FOR INSTANCE GETS THEIR FIX A TICKET THEY GET THROUGH THE SEASON THEY HARVEST THEIR TOMATOES DOES THAT MEAN THAT NEXT YEAR THEY CAN JUST ASK FOR ANOTHER FIX THE TICKET. HOW DO YOU ADDRESS KIND OF IS THERE SOME POINT AT WHICH THEY HAVE TO FIX IT THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF THE BILL OUTLINES THAT EXACTLY I WILL LOOK TO ANY HELP THAT -- ANYWAY GIVE ME BUT WHAT I'M THINKING IS THAT YOU HAVE THESE TRUCKS HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED EVERY YEAR SO IF THEY ARE NOT CERTIFIED AND THEY'D GO OVER THERE SEVENTY FIVE DAYS. IT IS GOING TO BE CAUGHT THE NEXT TIME THEY GO TO GET THE SORT OF THE OPERATORS -- PERMIT. BUT I JUST WANT TO SUGGEST THAT YOU ADD SOME CLARITY THAT MAYBE THEIR LIMITED EACH VEHICLE TO YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO OR SOMETHING IN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME JUST AS YOU MOVE FORWARD AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'LL BE REGULATION SETTING AS YOU MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I WAS. JUST A CONCERN AND APPARENTLY WE'RE WORKING WITH C. H. P. ON THIS SO I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT GREAT THING I WILL SAY I I I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS FORWARD IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I'M REALLY GLAD THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE AT THE TABLE AND THAT PEOPLE ARE SORT OF MOVING. TOWARDS A PLACE OF OF MAKING IT WORKABLE FOR EVERYBODY AND AND DRESSING THE CONCERNS I WILL JUST SAY AS A SIDE THAT I'M NOT. NECESSARILY CONVINCED THAT. AGRICULTURAL TRUCKERS YOU KNOW OUR SORT OF SPECIAL OVER A SMALL INDEPENDENT OPERATOR LET'S SAY WHO STILL MIGHT NEED TO GET FOOD OUT OF A PROCESSING PLANT BEFORE THE FOOD GOES BAD -- AND SOME OF THAT AGRICULTURAL FLEETS YOU KNOW CAN HAVE A HUNDRED TRUCKS IN THEM -- YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE WORKING OUT OF THE PORTS MAYBE IT'S ONE PERSON WITH ONE TRUCK AND THEY'RE NOT HAVING QUITE THE KIND OF LEEWAY THAT WE'RE GIVING. TO THE AGRICULTURAL -- TRUCKERS SO I JUST SORT OF QUESTION THAT YOU KNOW ON THE BASIS OF FAIRNESS BUT SOMETHING ELSE TO CONSIDER AS YOU MOVE FORWARD MAYBE HAVING A LITTLE BIT. LESS. CHARITY WITH THE LARGER FLEETS BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED FIFTY TRUCKS. IN ROTATION YOU STILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO CYCLE THEM THROUGH TO DEAL WITH ALL THE ISSUES YOU KNOW ON THE FARM HOPEFULLY OR YOU HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO AT LEAST MAINTAIN THEM TO WHERE THEY CAN PASS. OR YOU TEST THEM BEFORE YOUR SEVENTY TWO DAY WINDOW -- BUT THE POINT IS WE'RE NOT GIVING THAT SAME DISCRETION TO AN AN AN OPERATOR WHO MIGHT HAVE ONE TRUCK. WHO STILL YOU KNOW IS PUTTING FOOD ON THEIR TABLE I'M GIVING THEM A LESS AMOUNT OF TIME SO THERE'S JUST SORT OF A? THE FAIRNESS ISSUE. YEAH I I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU -- MADAM CHAIR I THINK THAT OUR HOPE OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS WORKING ON THIS BILL IS A WE GET SOMETHING REALLY SIGNIFICANT THAT IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. MIGHT WE HAVE TO COME BACK IN THE FUTURE ABSOLUTELY BUT THIS BILL IF I WE GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE GETS OFFER FORGETS THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND ASSIGN WILL MAKE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE HEALTH -- UP ALL CALIFORNIANS AND OF THE AIR QUALITY MATT CLOSE NOW ARE YOU DONE. I'M DONE OKAY BUT I I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT BILL AND SO I YOU KNOW I'VE JUST BRING THIS UP IS AS THOUGHTS BUT NO I WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T. FORCE ANY AMENDMENTS ON YOU SO WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS BUT PLEASE. AND I ONLY I I APPRECIATE AND I SAID BECAUSE I'M GETTING A LITTLE BIT FIRED UP SO YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE DIDN'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS -- THE WE HAD SMOG DAYS EVERY DAY AND I WAS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES AND IT WOULDN'T SOME PEOPLE COME TRAVEL TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NINETY MINUTE THERE ARE MOUNTAINS THERE AND WE'VE BEEN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF WORK NOT MYSELF BUT OTHERS. SO WE SEE THE MOUNTAINS ALMOST EVERY DAY NOW IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THE AIR QUALITY IS JUST AS BAD AND IT'S BECAUSE THE PARTICULATES ARE SMALLER -- WHEN I LAND IN ONTARIO SOMETIMES I LOOK ON MY HANDY DANDY APT TO SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE IS AN ALMOST EVERY THURSDAY WHEN I LANDED ON TERRIO ITS SAYS? ERROR UNHEALTHY FOR SOME GROUPS SO WE ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND I THINK THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY. IN ADDRESSING A LOT OF CONCERNS MAKING SURE THAT THE TRUCK DRIVERS FROM OUT OF STATE ARE COMING IN AND NOT COMPLYING LIKE ARE GOOD CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION AND DRIVERS ARE DOING. SO I EIGHT THINK ABOUT YOU HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE PLASTICS AND THEIR CHILDREN I'M GONNA BE A GRAMMA AND NOVEMBER AND I WANT TO LEAVE THE WORLD A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER -- THEN WE HAVE IT NOW AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY IN DOING THAT AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EVERYONE AND GET TO A PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY IS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT HAPPY AND A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

HELLO GOOD WHAT IS THIS -- ALMOST GOOD EVENING -- MY APOLOGIES -- BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO SB. FIVE FIFTY ONE IT'S A BILL THAT AUTHORIZES THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES LOVINGLY KNOWN AS DARKER -- TO FULLY ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF DECOMMISSIONING AND REMEDIATING OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR STATE OF THE BILL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OF OF BILLS. AND ASKED BUT KNOWING THIS LATE HOUR IT BASICALLY -- WE KNOW AND I KNOW THAT THEIR COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE. WHO UNDERSTAND AND HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE FOR QUITE SOME TIME? THE COST OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE STATE IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. IN MY DISTRICT ALONE WHICH I MONNING TO SHARE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE KNOWN INSURANCE THE PAST FEW YEARS WE SPENT UPWARD TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF TAXPAYER FUNDS FOR TO FACILITIES IN A SERIES OF ABANDONED COSTA WELLS. WITH MANY MILLIONS YET TO SPEND. THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE WELLS FACILITY STORAGE TANKS PRODUCTION PIPELINES OF RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE LITTLE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR TO PLAN FOR PREPARE FOR OR TO MITIGATE BEFORE THE COSTS AT THE STATE TAX PAYER. THIS IS ALREADY PROVING TO BE A BUDGET IMPACTING PROBLEM FOR JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN NORTH AMERICA INCLUDING AN OIL AND GAS INTENSIVE STATES. AND PROVINCES LIKE WYOMING COLORADO IN ALBERTA CANADA THIS IS NOT JUST UNIQUE TO US BUT IT IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING TO ADDRESS. SO THIS BILL DIRECTS DARKER TO REQUIRE OIL AND GAS OPERATORS TO OPEN THEIR BOOKS TO THE DIVISION ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO THAT THE DIVISION CAN MAKE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS WHICH INCLUDE NACHOS ACOSTA PLUGGING IN ABANDONING WELLS. BUT ALSO THE COST FOR DECOMMISSIONING ALL RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOR RESTORING PRODUCTION SITE TO USABLE CONDITION. THIS PROPOSAL BUILT OFF OF EXISTING AUTHORITIES INCLUDING EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM PASSED LEGISLATION DONE BY -- FORMER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SANTA BARBARA -- DOS WILLIAMS THIS PROPOSAL ALSO SYNCS WITH CURRENT LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS INCLUDING AS I MENTIONED A GREAT BILL FROM MY COLLEAGUE AND PARTNER FROM SANTA BARBARA. ON BONDING LIMITS FOR ONSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES. WITH THIS BILL BOTH THE DIVISION AND STATE POLICYMAKERS WILL HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FULL SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM AND A PLAN FOR THE LIABILITIES. IN AN UP FRONT AN ORDERLY WAY BASICALLY BOTTOM LINE WE OWE THIS TO THE TAXPAYERS CALIFORNIA WITH THAT. I HAVE AN AKITA KARATE FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE CENTER TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE BILL SENATOR ARE YOU GONNA BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- YES I'M SORRY I DIDN'T PUT THAT IN THE I DIDN'T PUT THAT IN THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS AUTHORS MOMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS THANK YOU. I THINK YOU CHEN MEMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. FIVE FIVE ONE WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO SYSTEMATICALLY IN COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS CLOSE TO RETIREMENT OR THAT MAY BE DISCONTINUED OR ABANDONED. THE STATE LACKS THE ABILITY TO FORECAST BUDGET AND PLAN FOR FUTURE LIABILITIES FORCING THE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TAXPAYERS TO SHOULDER SIGNIFICANT COSTS OFTEN IN THE HNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE SENATOR THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING AND IT'S COSTING THE STATE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AN ONGOING AN UNFORESEEN EXPENDITURES. SB FIVE FIVE ONE ALONG WITH THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS PROPOSED PROPOSES A REASONABLE APPROACH WITH RESPECT TO DETERMINING OPERATOR% LIABILITY. PRIORITIZING INSPECTING WELLS AND ESTIMATING THE COST TO PLUG ABANDONED AND THE COMMISSION FACILITIES TO BETTER PROTECT THE STATE TAX PAYERS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT FROM THE RISKS POSED BY ABANDONED OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND AFTER I BOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BILL ALLEY -- FOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THE WORKING GROUP WE SUPPORT THE BILL TO BETTER PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU. WILL BRING YOUR ANTENNA GALLAGHER FROM THREE FIFTY SACRAMENTO IN SUPPORT. AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION I JUST LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE WERE SURPRISINGLY CLOSE TO THE TIME.

JANET **** FOR THREE FIFTY SILICON VALLEY IN STRONG SUPPORT. JUST MILAN FOR HEAL THE BAY IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS WE SUCH AS WITH THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE SB FIVE FIVE ONE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES DAGR. TO ENGAGE IN PREMATURELY AND HIGHLY SPEAKING OF ANALYSIS RELATED TO THE REMEDIATION COSTS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED TO OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS. THE BILL OBVIOUSLY IGNORES THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY OWNERS TO EVALUATE -- ALTERNATIVE LAND USE IS -- ONCE A FACILITY COULD BE REACH ITS POTENTIAL END OF LIFE -- NOW AS IT PERTAINS TO WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADDED COST OF A THIRD PARTY CONSOLE IS ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY I THAT ADDS NO VALUE TO DOCTOR GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE MODEL INTENDED TO PROVIDE THE DIVISION -- IS AN ESTIMATE ON EACH OPERATORS OBLIGATION -- ADDING ADDITIONAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ON DOG ON ON COULD POTENTIALLY DISTRACT. FROM THE AGENCY FROM FOCUSING ON ABANDONING OR FROM WELLS ENSURING OPERATORS ARE MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE. WITH THEIR I. TO WELL ABANDONMENT SCHEDULES -- THE DATA THAT COULD BE DERIVED FROM WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED WERE RESULT IN SECURING OUT OF CONTEXT INFORMATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO REGULATORY CONFUSION. AS AN ATTEMPT TO PREMATURELY ESTIMATE AND INDIVIDUALS OPERATORS DECOMMISSIONING OBLIGATIONS THAT FAILS TO AGAIN ACCOUNT. FOR MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT COSTS DRIVEN BY SYKORA ADVANCE IN REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES ALTERNATIVE SITE USES SO FOR THESE REASONS WHAT SPA. OPPOSES THE BILL IN PRINT AND AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY WITHOUT WILL COME UP TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO OKAY SEE NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- YEAH -- DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN WITH WAS PICKS UP TO TELL YOU THAT -- THIS IS ALL SORT OF A THE DESIRE NOT. TO NOT TO HAVE US NOHL BY THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE pIT'S A SPECULATIVE -- OR ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY WE WANT TO DOCTOR TO KNOW SO THEY CAN TELL US THIS IS A TRANSPARENCY BILL -- A IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIRD POT PARTIES TO BE OBJECTIVE AND INDEPENDENT WHICH RESPONSES SORT OF A CONTRADICTION I THINK THE ARGUMENT SORT OF SELF CONTRADICTORY BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IF WE ARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO END UP HAVING -- TO PAY TO DECOMMISSION REMEDIATE. WE SHOULD KNOW AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN SO THAT WE CAN CONSIDER ALL OUR OPTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION. MOTION AS HE SAID THAT THE SERVER YEAH. OKAY SORRY WE WERE ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM EIGHTEEN SB FIVE FIFTY ONE BY SENATOR JACKSON THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I'VE FLORA. FLORA NO CHAU CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FONG. GARCIA LIMON. LOW MOAN AYE MATHIS. MCCARTY. MURATSUCHI. THREE THREE AYE STONE. STONE I SIX ONE SIX ONE THE BILL IS NOT LEAVE THE ROLE OPENED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS YES. RED. WAY OKAY -- SKINNER. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] IF [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] ALL THE BUDGET RIGHT SOMEONE ARTICULATION REPUBLICAN WANT TO GO AHEAD AND START. AND THE SECOND QUESTION. LIKE WHY DON'T. WHEN THE NEXT? AND YOU KNOW YOU COULD INJURE. WE WILL WITH. AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL. ZERO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO MAKE MOVES ON THE FLOOR. THE BILL YEAH THE GENERAL THE PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT THE MOST UNHEALTHY. SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION THE QUANTITY OF IT. IS FROM OUR IT. REGULAR DIESEL POWERED. MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. THAT PARTICULAR I SAY PARTICULAR POLLUTION IS PARTICULATE MATTER -- BUT IT IS ONE OF OUR PRIMARY CAUSES OF ASTHMA WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT RATE SEVEN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE'S LINKS TO MANY OTHER -- HEALTH RELATED CONDITION BASICALLY WHAT S. B. FORTY FOUR DOES HIS DIRECT OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO UPDATE PLANS FOR HOW WE CAN ASSIST. OUR FLEET OWNERS AND DRIVERS OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TO BE ABLE -- TO MEET OUR FEDERAL CLEAN AIR STANDARDS. IN OTHER GOALS THE CALIFORNIA HAVES BY TRANSITIONING OFF OF THAT DIESEL AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE FOR AND MY WITNESSES I HAVE MERIT ALEXANDER FROM CAL START. AND I ALSO HAVE. COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH FOR FIRST WITH THIS IN TWO MINUTES PLEASE. HELLO AGAIN MEREDITH ALEXANDER FROM CAL START -- SO I'LL SKIP MY INTRODUCTION BUT CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS HAVE GIVEN RISEN TO A RENAISSANCE IN VEHICLE MANUFACTURING IN THE STATE. AND WE ARE SEEING COMPANIES SETTING UP SHOP HERE TO RESEARCH DESIGN AND BUILD CLEAN VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS ALL VEHICLE CLASSES. SO AS A RESULT MANY NEW VEHICLE CLASSES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING OR HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMMERCIALIZED. SO AS LONG AS THE STATE STAYS THE COURSE WITH ITS CLIMATE COMMITMENTS THESE TRENDS WILL NOT ONLY CONTINUE WE EXPECT BUT INCREASE. SO SB FORTY FOUR REPRESENTS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN OUR STATES PLANNING EFFORTS TO KEEP RATCHETING DOWN A VEHICLE EMISSIONS AND SIGNALING TO MANUFACTURERS THAT WE'RE NOT BACKING DOWN FROM OUR COMMITMENTS. SO TO BUILD NEW CLEAN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED CLEAR SIGNALS FROM THE STATE AND A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT THIS VISION. IT TAKES MANUFACTURERS ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS TO BRING A NEW PRODUCT TO MARKET. AND THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO START THIS PROCESS UNLESS THEY CAN LOOK OUT AND SEE WHERE THE STATE IS GOING AND HOW IT PLANS TO GET THERE. SO BUSINESSES IN CLOSING ARE MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ON A LONG TERM BASIS AND WE NEED THE STATE TO MORE CLOSELY THINK IT'S PLANNING AND APPROPRIATIONS FOR PROGRAMS WITH THOSE INVESTMENT CYCLES. WHICH WOULD HELP BRING TO MARKET MORE OF THESE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES MORE QUICKLY. AND CONTINUE TO DROP MORE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR INVESTORS TO THE STATE SO FOR THESE REASONS WE REQUEST WE'VE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR IPHONE. BILL MY GOVERNMENT COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA FIRST DECLARED DIESEL EXHAUST TO BE A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT. AND THE STATE'S TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS SINCE THEN TO REDUCE DIESEL EMISSIONS BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE EXCESSIVE LEVELS OF SMOG AND PARTICULAR POLLUTION. IN MOST OF THE STATE AND THAT CAUSES HEART AND LUNG DISEASE AND PREMATURE DEATH AND WE ALSO HAVE DIESEL MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL WHERE THE FOR SUPPORT.
