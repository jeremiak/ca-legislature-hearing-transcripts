OPERATIONS LIKE THIS. I THINK THE RECORD IS A HAVE A ABLE TO WORK WITH THIS IS GOING ON. AS IN TWENTY WHEN THEY'RE SIX INSTANCES THEY DO KNOW THE SYSTEMS ARE COMING IN IT GIVES THEM AN ABILITY TO GO TO THE SYSTEM OPERATORS. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A THERE'S NO LAWSUIT REMEDY HERE. BUT I THINK IT IS SUCH A BRIGHT LINE RULE THAT IT IS ILLEGAL UNLESS THE STATE OUR REACH OUT AGGRESSIVELY WITH SOME OF THESE OPERATORS. THEY ARE ONLINE THE EXTENT OF THEIR ONLINE THEY'RE PROMOTING THEIR BUSINESS FOR THE ACCESS SO THERE IS A WAY TO TRACK THEM DOWN. AND PRECIADO IT WHAT WHAT'S THE REMEDIES IT MAY MEAN UNDER. WAY THEM IN KIND OF A LOW. PROVISIONS ANTI BOTCHED BUT WHAT ARE THEY ARE THE- PENALTY. ARE THEY SHOULD LOOK FOR. IN GOING TO. I THINK WOULD BE FORCED WAR THE- POWER GRAB GENERALLY.

THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING- THIS ISSUE FORWARD- WELL I GUESS- FIRST OF ALL COMMENTS AND THEN MAYBE PERHAPS QUESTION- THE- BIGGEST MOST BECOMING I WOULD MAKE IS THAT- I THINK THE PURPOSES AND GOALS OF THIS- PARTICULAR BILL CERTAIN VERY IMPORTANT SO IT'S IMPORTANT THA PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARIES- RECEIVED- OUR OUR KNOWLEDGE. ABOUT- CALL- WELL I LIKE THE WORD CO SECTOR BETTER TO COMP IN CULTURE COMPETENCE REALLY ME BUT- BUT ESSENTIALLY- COUPLE AND AS IN. THE IMPORT THAT THEY HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE BASE A I THINK I'VE EXPRESSED IN THIS COMMITTEE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS CONCERNS ABOUT. MANDATORY CM- CONTINUING EDUCATION BECAUSE FROM ADULT LEARNING PERSPECTIVE- IT'S- IT'S BETTER TO HAVE PEOPLE IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE GAPS AND THEN HAVE THEM PURSUE. THAT EDUCATION THEY'RE MORE LIKELY CHANGE BEHAVIOR FROM THAT AND THROUGH MANTA THAT REQUIRED COURSES- TELLING THEY HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE IN WHICH CASE THEY SIMPLY CHECK THE BOX AND DOESN'T ACTUALLY CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR. SO SO IT'S SOMETHING TAT I DO HAVE THAT CONCERN WHEN IT EVER COMES TO A- BILL THAT. WE'RE WE REQUIRE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF EDUCATION- THROUGH CONTINUING EDUCATION HOWEVER I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS THE FIDUCIARY SPECIAL FIDUCIARY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT AT LEAST WITHIN THE ORGAN THE PROFESSION ITSELF. THAT THERE'S A DESIRE FOR THIS KIND OF REQUIREMENT- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT IN TERMS OF THE- AND I DID HEAR TESTIMONY FROM THE PROFESSION. FIDUCIA CESSATION. THE V. SO- WHO IS- WHO'S GOING TO TURN WHICH ACTUALLY THIS. AND THEN ADD AND THE CON AND IS THERE ANY HOPE- TO SHOW ASIDE FROM SOMEONE TAKE THE COURSE TO MEET THE PRESS DIRECT IS THAT SOME. OF THE NOW OR THEIR- THEIR ACTUAL APPLICATION OF WHAT'S BEING TIED SO ANOTHER WORDS ARE WE DOING ANY SERVICE SUSSMAN OF THE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OR ACTUAL BEHAVIOR OF THE FINISH OF THIS PRODUCE YOUR EIGHT IN TERMS OF THAT REFLECTS A CULTURAL. EFFECTIVENESS OR CULTURAL COMPETENCE. BUSINESS ARE THANK YOU. FOR SOME OF YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR QUESTION AS WELL DR AND AS AS YOU KNOW I. I'VE NOT REALLY DABBLED MUCH IN THIS SPACE- BECAUSE I TOO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU ARE CONFIDENT IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING UP. IN YOUR CAREER AND YOU ARE KEEPING UP TO DATE. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED- IN FACT MANY OCCASIONS WE- ARE GO THROUGH ETHICS TRAINING AND THERE'S A FINE THERE'S A- VERY DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN ETHICS AND HOW MUCH TRAINING YOU CAN GET AND- THE MORALS THAT YOU PLAN ON A DAILY BASIS. SO I I'M WITH OU ON THAT- IT'S JUST THAT THIS WAS SUCH A SENSITIVE ISSUE AND GIVEN WHERE THINGS ARE AT GIVEN WHERE HOW SOME COMMUNITIES ARE NOT TREATED- THE WAY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM TREATED. IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO. PLACE A STANDARD- TO YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY I BELIEVE THE P. FAQ WHICH IS THE PROFESSIONAL PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION. WILL BE PROVIDING THE GUIDELINES AND BE THEMSELVES ALSO ARE AN APPROVED PROVIDER OF THESE- ONGOING EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE- APPRECIATE THAT- I THINK AGAIN- BECAUSE THE PROFESSIONAL PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION IS ALSO YOU KNOW SOUNDS LIKE IT IS NOW IN SUPPORT OF THE ONE SPONSORS BUT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE A VERY STRONG SUPPORTER TESTIFIED HERE THAT DOES MAKE ME A- LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH SAYING. THIS REQUIREMENTS OKAY BUT I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT YOU KNOW GENERALLY NOT TOO KEEN ABOUT THOSE THINGS AT THE END IN MY MIND IF THERE IS ANY OTHER ALSO MEASURES WAYS TO ASSESS AS TO- IN ADDITION TO IS JUST SOMEONE HAVING TAKEN A CLASS THAT THERE'S SOME WAY YOU KNOW EXPECTATION WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE DEMONSTRATE THEIR ACTUAL. APPLICATION OR CANCIONES COMPETENT OF FORKS- MUSICAL COMPETENCE THE OUTCOMES WOULD ALSO IN MY MIND ACTUALLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN TAKING A COURSE IN ITSELF SO I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE IT. YOUR I GUESS THE ASSOCIATION AND THE BOARD TO LOOK AT WAYS PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE THE ACTUAL APPLICATION OF THE TYPES OF TOPICS THAT WOULD BE COVERED IN THE- REQUIREMENTS AS OUTLINED IN YOUR BILL SELF THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- CENTER PENSER JONES. CHAIRMAN AND FASTENERS CENTER PANIC SHARE A SIMILAR PHILOSOPHY ON CONTINUING EDUCATION I TYPICALLY HAVE A HARD TIME OF SUPPORTING LEGISLATIVE MANDATES A CONTINUING EDUCATION I UNDERSTAND THE ASSOCIATIONS. IN FAVOR- WHAT WHERE'S THE BORDER THIS AND- SO I GUESS QUESTIONS WERE THE BOARD ON IT AND THEY ARE. ON IT AND NUMBER TWO CAN'T JUST MAKE THE CHANGE THEM SO. WHY IS IT RE. RELIGIOUS OVERSIGHT TO DO. THAT'S A QUESTION BECAUSE I BROUGHT THIS BILL FIRST FIRST TIME AROUND TWO YEARS AGO PRIOR TO KOBE- SO I PROBABLY ASKED THAT QUESTION EARLY ON AND I CAN'T REMEMBER IT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T REVISITED IT SO I'M HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU SENATOR- BUT I BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS THEY DO ASK AS WELL WHY DO WE NEED A BILL- BUT- IT. I ATE. LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. BUT I DO ALSO SHARE YOUR SENTIMENT ALONG WITH DOCTOR PENNED ABOUT LIMITING RIGHT. THE ONGOING BASIS OF THIS- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN STINNER ARCHULETA YES- THANK YOU AND MY QUESTION THE AUTHOR IS- YEAH I NOTICED THAT FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS YOU WERE JUST TRYING TO PRESENT SOMETHING ACROSS LIKE THIS AND IT WAS EVEN VETOED BY- GOVERNOR BROWN WAY BACK IN. BUT THEY'RE SUCH A STRONG NEED ANYTHING FOR EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER CULTURES AND SEAN WERE FINDING THAT O IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT BE THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER DOESN'T MATTER IS WE NEED TO KNOW. ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AND HOW WE CAN INTERACT TO BE BETTER CITIZENS AND COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER AND IF THIS BILL WILL OPEN THAT DOOR AND- INSURE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS PROFESSION HAVE THE SENSITIVITY AND KNOWLEDGE HOW TO DEAL WITH ONE ANOTHER. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COUNSELING- INDIVIDUALS FINANCIALLY IN DAY CARE AND HOUSING AND MEDICAL pEVERYONE SHOULD HAVE GOT TO KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD EVERYONE. SHOW I AM I WAS SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME AND- BUT MY QUESTION- TO THIS FAMILY MEMBER IS WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAD PROBLEMS IN THE PAST. AND SO DID YOU PUT AMENDMENTS TOGETHER HOW DID YOU GET SO FAR AND I THINK. I WOULD HOPE THAT NOW WHERE YOU'RE AT A POINT OF ACTUALLY PASSING THIS BILL BUT WHAT. WERE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU HAD AND WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAD A- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF. SO HE- I- THE TWO KIND OF A OUT THE NICEST WAY OF SAYING THIS- I BELIEVE THAT THIS THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING AND A MISTAKE AND THAT'S WHY THE VETO WAS- BROUGHT ABOUT THE FIRST TIME AROUND- THAT'S THAT'S THE- I JUST WISH I CAN EXPLAIN DESCRIBE THE SCENARIO BECAUSE- THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY BUILDER WAS A SECOND BILL ALSO THAT BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING WAS WE TOOK- SO. BUT BUT BUT I'VE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THERE'S NO ISSUES OR CONCERNS AND SO THIS IS GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD AT THIS POINT. UP AT ONCE IT PASSES HOPEFULLY HERE AND THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE FLOOR- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS IN A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE FAVORABLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR.

FOR THANK YOU SIR. NEXT ITEM NUMBER. SIX ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SIX NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. WHEN YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A B. FIVE SIX NINE SPONSORED BY THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD WHICH RAISES THE MAXIMUM CAP ON CIVIL PENALTY FEES FOR CONTRACTORS ONLY 3% OF CONTRACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO A CIVIL PENALTY FEE EACH YEAR. BUT FOR THE FEW BAD ACTORS THAT DO EXIST CIVIL PENALTY FEES ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO DETER VIOLATING THE LAW UNFORTUNATELY THESE FREE CAPS ARE DECADES OUT OF DATE FOR MOST VIOLATIONS OF CONTRACTORS LAW THE MAXIMUM FEE THAT THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD CAN CHARGE. A CONTRACTOR WAS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS AMOUNT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS. OR A GREGIS CONTRACTORS CAN BE CHARGED UP TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS VIOLATION SPECIFIC MAXIMUM WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IT IS NEVER BEEN INCREASED IN TWENTY NINE YEARS. ADDITIONALLY WHEN A CONTRACTOR APPEALS A CITATION IT NOW COSTS THE C. S. O. B. AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DEFEND IN COURT PLUS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN EXPENSES FROM THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. EIGHTY FIVE SIXTY NINE SOLVES THESE PROBLEMS BY RAISING THE CAPS ON CIVIL PENALTY FEES TO BRING THEM IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT CONSUMER PRICE PRICE INDEX ALSO THIS MEASURE ALLOWS THE CSO B. TO ISSUE AN ADMONISHMENT LETTER WHEN EDUCATION OR PROOF OF COMPLIANCE IS DETERMINED TO BE A BETTER APPROACH THAN A CITATION. EIGHTY FIVE SIXTY NINE WILL HELP OFFSET THE COST FACED BY THE CSO B. IN DEFENDING CITATIONS AGAINST BAD ACTORS AND ENSURE THAT CIVIL PENALTY FEES REMAIN A VABLE DETERRENT TO VIOLATING THE LAW. THE COMMON SENSE APPROACH WILL ALLOW THE CSO B. TO CONTINUE EFFECTIVELY REGULATING THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA I DO HAVE WITH ME- WAR- TO TESTIFY MIKE JIM THAT SKIED WITH THE CSL BE. PLEASE PROCEED SIR. HELLO MR JIM THAT'S KING. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT GENETICALLY FREDDIE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE I SEE A FAMILY MEMBER STATED THERE ARE TWO MAIN BENEFITS FOR THIS BILL REALLY JUST TO BRING ADMINISTRATIVE FINES TO MODERN DAY LEVELS AND ALLOW MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ISSUE ADMONISHMENT LETTERS IN LIEU OF THOSE FINES- WITH THAT I'M CERTAINLY AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND RESPECTFULLY.

THE CURRENT CONTINUING EDUCATION IS LIMITED TO DISABILITY ACCESS WHICH MEANS THAT MANY ARCHITECTS MAY HAVE LITTLE OR NO EXPOSURE TO STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CONSTRUCTION THEREFORE EIGHTY TEN TEN IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT ARCHITECTS LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO COMPLETE FIVE HOURS OF ZERO NET CARBON CONTINUING EDUCATION. FOR TWO YEAR RENEWAL CYCLE THE COMMITTEE RAISED A QUESTION ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE TRAINING WELL MY WITNESSES CAN PROVIDE MORE DETAIL I WOULD KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL PROVIDERS ALREADY IN THE SPACE MOREOVER WITH THE GROWING ACKNOWLDGEMENT OF THE NEED TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IN DESIGN I WOULD EXPECT MORE PROVIDERS AND CLASSES WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WROTE. THANK YOU SIR I BELIEVE MIKE BELOW ON BEHALF OF K. A. CALIFORNIA AND BILL LEDDY ARCHITECT MEMBER. MAY BE ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY. YES THANK YOU MR KERR I AM LIKE THE LOAD FOR A I. A CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW NET ZERO CARBON REALLY IS THE DESIGN ISSUE OF OUR TIME AND IT APPLIES TO ALL TYPES OF PROPERTIES WITHIN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT SO RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL. INDUSTRIAL PRIVATE PROPERTIES PUBLIC PROPERTIES SUCH AS HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS AND- FACILITIES. THE TECHNOLOGY REALLY IS CHANGING AT WARP SPEED EVERY YEAR IS DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE. TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. THE SECOND IS TAUGHT AND SO IT IS A PART OF PRE LICENSING EDUCATION. BUT YOU KNOW MANY ARCHITECTS MIGHT BE YEARS OR EVEN DECADES PAST. BY THE TIME WHICH THEY- QUALIFIED FOR THEIR LICENSE BY EDUCATION AN EXAMPLE. OF THE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY LICENSED ARCHITECT HAS SOME EXPOSURE TO THIS CRITICAL. ISSUE IS CONTINUING EDUCATION- THERE ARE MANY PROVIDERS ALREADY AS MR OPPERMAN INDICATED NOT JUST A I. EIGHT. THERE IS A NEW BUILDING INSTITUTE- COURSES BY HANLEY WOOD GREEN BUILDING EDUCATION SERVICES COMPANY AND WE THINK THAT MANY MANY MORE WILL BE COMING. AND THE REQUIREMENT ON DISABILITY ACCESS I THINK IT'S A LESS PRODUCE IN THE TEN YEARS THAT THAT REQUIREMENT HAS EXISTED. THERE BEEN OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT COURSES BY A TREMENDOUS VARIETY OF PROVIDERS. A. I. A. IS A DISTINCT MINORITY SO THE THERE IS NO MONOPOLY GOING ON HERE WE THINK THE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE NOW WE THINK A LOT MORE WILL BE COMING. YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY MINDFUL OF THE COMMENTS OF DR AND THEN SENATOR JONES- IN TERMS OF. OUTPUT BUILDING CODES ARE CHANGING REGULARLY IN THIS AREA TO REFLECT- THE INCREDIBLE NEED TO REDUCE CARBON FOOTPRINT. SO ONE OF THE WAYS TO MEASURE OUTPUT IS ON THE ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS BY LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIALS WHO SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO GET GOING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE BILL WILL ALLOW THIS TO BE A REQUIREMENT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE RENEWAL CYCLE. THAT'S THE EARLIEST IT CAN BE INCORPORATED WERE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EYE POKE. WITH ME AS YOU NOTED MR KERR'S BILL LADY FROM.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS. IN THE CHAMBER SENATOR NEWMAN. DAY RICHARD LIKE TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR- ON BRINGING THIS BILL AND I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF SUCH. AND SUCH TIME TO PROVIDE ALSO LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL- WHEN THAT TIME IS APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. PERFECT THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MR CHAIR AT JUST THE SIMILAR CONCERNS TO THE LAST BILL. ON THE CONTINUING EDUCATION- YOU KNOW. HERE IN MY- WITH ERICA. WITH LEE SORT OF- AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IS LIKE A NATURAL COMP COMPETITIVE ISSUE WITH THE- INDUSTRY. IN ARCHITECTURE EVERY DAY TRYING TO GET BETTER AND BETTER WHAT THEY DO. READING FIVE HOURS OF. OF THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION- YOU KNOW IT'S FIVE HOURS ENOUGH. BUT THE YOU KNOW THE OVERARCHING CONCERN FOR ME IS IT LEGISLATIVELY. REQUIRED FOR THE BOARD TO BUILD MAKE THIS CHANGE RIGHT AT THE BOARD JUST DO IT WITHOUT LATEST LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. BRIGITTE THAT SENDER AND THEN WE'LL DEFER TO- EITHER MY WITNESSES IF THEY HAVE COMMENTS IN TERMS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BOARD I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THE BOARD ABOUT THE BILL- AND THEN THE BOARD CHAIR RECENTLY OR THE BOARD PRESIDENT RECENTLY SIGNED OFF ON- THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MAKING TODAY- BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BROUGHT TO US BY. BY THE ARCHITECTS BY A SO- YOU KNOW THEY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND WILL BE VALUABLE TO THEIR MEMBERS AND THEN. TOOK AWHILE BUT APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER. THANK YOU I WANT TO COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD AND HEAR THE CONCERNS OF MIGHT OF- THAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER JONES I DO WANT TO SAY I DO THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC IT WAS NOTED THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS 40% OF CARBON EMISSIONS ARE FROM BUILDINGS AND CONSISTENT WITH MY DAD SB SIXTY EIGHT WE TALKED ABOUT HOW CONTRACTORS THEY'RE NOT OF CONTRACTORS WHO UNDERSTAND. ON THE- YOU KNOW THE KIND OF SCIENCE AND AVAILABILITY OF A NEW ELECTION YOU KNOW ALL LECTURE COMPLIANCES LIKE HEAT PUMPS AND OTHER THINGS AND I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT THE ARCHITECTS UNDERSTAND TO WHAT IS NOW POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH NEW- ON NEW SITES EVERY DAY NOW AND NEW MATURE IN A NEW BUILDING MATERIALS AND SUCH SO I COMMEND THIS. EFFORT AND I DO THINK- WILL BE CENSORED CONCERNS OF COME OVER LEGISLATING. THESE BOARDS I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. EIGHT THESE ARE. THANK YOU SENATOR DR. I YOU THANK YOU FOR MUCH AND SHARE FIRST OF ALL I DO WANT COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR A FOR TRYING TO DRESS- THIS ISSUE OF BEING SURE THAT ARCHITECTS- HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS. TO DO- YOU KNOW. ZERO NET CARBON- DESIGN YEAH. IN AND I THINK THAT- SERVE OUT FOR THE- PREVIOUS BILL THAT WE DISCUSSED I GUESS MY AGE. SO I THINK WE NEED TO SEPARATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE FROM THOSE MANDATORY C. CONTINUE EDUCATION IS THE PROPRIO TO DRESSING A KNOWLEDGE DEFICIENCY. RIGHT AT LEAST END UP PORTION OR PERHAPS A LARGE PORTION OF MEMBERS OF OUR PROFESSION. AND I GUESS MY YOU KNOW- MIKE. IS THAT FIRST OF ALL WE DO KNOW FROM AN EDUCATIONAL STANDPOINT MANDATORY C. E. KNOWS THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP THEM FROM TAKING COURSES- OTHER THAN POTENTIALLY THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE COURSES SO I THINK THE QUESTION ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY COURSES RAISING THE POLICY COMMENT ACTUALLY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IF THE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE MAYBE THAT'S THE MAIN BARRIER THAN THE REQUIREMENT PEOPLE TAKE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CREDITS. IN THAT CERTAINLY THERE'S THE MAN FOR THAT KNOWLEDGE- PEOPLE WILL- THE OTHER THING THAT I LOVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT- YOU KNOW THIS ALSO IS NOT ONLY REQUIREMENT FOR ONE TIME IT'S AN ONGOING REQUIREMENT AND CERTAINLY WELL THIS IS I AGREE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT- IT'S- THIRTY SIX A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE AN ARCHITECT- SHE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THOSE LOTS OF ZERO CARBON DESIGN WHO NOW STILL HAS TO TAKE FIVE CREDITS IN THIS WORSE THERE MIGHT BE. SOME OTHER AREA THAT THEY- MAY HAVE MORE OF THE- A- SO- SO THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE ABOUT I THINK. MANDATORY C. E. IT'S NOT THAT I THINK ZERO CARBON THAT CARBON CREDIT- DESIGN ISN'T VERY IMPORTANT IN FACT WE SHOULD TRY TO DO IT I AM. YEAH I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS IS THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL SO. THAT'S THE PROFESSION ITSELF. ARE SAYING THAT WE HAVE A NEED HERE WE FEEL IMMEDIATE NEEDS SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT- I THINK THAT- I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN AGAIN LOOK AT. CERTAIN OUTCOMES NOT JUST PROCESS MEASURES WHICH IS THE PEOPLE TAKE A CLASS I DO THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE VEIL BELIEVE CLASSES. ARE ARE THESE COURSES BECAUSE THAT MAY BE MORE OF THE BERRIER DANNY REQUIREMENTS- AND I CERTAINLY HEARD THE TESTIMONY FROM THE SPONSORS ABOUT TRYING TO DRESS THAT. SO I GUESS WITH THAT- I DO APPRECIATE THE WHAT THIS BILLS TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND TO LOOK FORWARD TO. FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S LEADERSHIP AND TRYING TO TRUST THIS. AND ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ARCHITECTS AS WELL AS ABOUT HOW WE CAN TRY TO GET TO WHERE THE- I THINK EVERYONE'S TRYING TO GET TO- BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT YEAH I AGAIN I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. ACHIEVING THIS THROUGH A MANDATORY CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT. THAT WE'RE LEGISLATING THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR GRAHAM. THE YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS- IN A CONCERNS THAT OUR BY THIS WILL DEFINITELY YOU KNOW MORE CALM ABOUT THIS ISSUE RESPECTFULLY FOR A VOTE THANK YOU SIR THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR NEWMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST TO MEN AND REFERRED THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.
