THANK YOU ALSO FOR JOINING US TODAY ND I'M SORRY FOR BEING LATE TO MY OWN. COMMITTEE HEARING. MY NAME IS MARC BERMAN AND I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO THE FIFTH AND LAST HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. IN CALIFORNIA. THIS HEARING IS BEING LIVE STREAMED IN RECORDED AND WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE WEB PAGE WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON MY ASSEMBLY WEBSITE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLAN TAB. IN NINETEEN SIXTY CALIFORNIA DEVELOPED A VISIONARY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION KNOWN AS THE MASTER PLAN. HOWEVER MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE. NINETEEN SIXTY POPULATION GROWTH INCREASE STUDENT DIVERSITY A CHANGING LEADING INDUSTRIES AND THEIR NEED FOR TALENT AS WELL AS THE FIELD OF EDUCATION ITSELF. REPRESENTING SILICON VALLEY I SEE HOW QUICKLY TECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCING ALONG WITH THE RISE OF NEW INDUSTRIES. BOTH OF ALTERED STUDENT NEEDS AND BOOSTED DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. WE NEED OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO A HOST OF ISSUES NEVER PREVIOUSLY ENVISIONED. SINCE THE SELECT COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR WE HAVE HELD HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH LEGISLATIVE REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A MASTER PLAN IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR TODAY AND FOR THE FUTURE. WE NEED TO KEEP THE STATE'S PROMISE TO OUR STUDENTS OF PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY HIGHER EDUCATION TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS IT WHOEVER EVERY CHILD WHO WANTS ONE IT IS QUALIFIED. THE SELECT COMMITTEE IS THE FIRST STEP IN A MULTI YEAR ENDEAVOR TO UPDATE THE MASTER PLAN. I'M COMING IN WITH AN OPEN MIND AND DO NOT HAVE ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OR SOLUTIONS AND I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME. I'LL BE THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AS BEING THE INFORMATION GATHERING PHASE WHERE WE HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND COLLECT FEEDBACK. WHICH IS WHAT WE WILL BE DOING TODAY. SELECT COMMITTEE HELD ITS FIRST HEARING LAST YEAR ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST -- HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE WE HEARD AN OVERVIEW AND STATUS OF HIGHER EDUCATION FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS WELL AS FROM LEADERS OF CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS.

YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PAUL STATE HOUSING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OUR OFFICE IS BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE SOME HISTORICAL CONTEXT ONE HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AND IMPLICATIONS FOR TODAY. SO I WILL DRESS THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE ADJACENT CONSTANT TOURISTS WILL DISCUSS THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS CAL STATE UNIVERSITY AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SO IN YOUR PACKET IS A HANDOUT TITLED CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES MAJOR BUDGET TRENDS. AND A HAND OUT FIRST PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF KEY COMMUNICORP FUNDING DEVELOPMENTS SINCE MASTER PLAN ADOPTION. IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES MAY HEAD OUT THEN SHOWS HOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING SOURCES HAVE CHANGED THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE DECADES. THEY HAD ALSO COVERS MAJOR CHANGES IN THE STATE'S METHOD FOR ALLOCATING FUNDS TWO THE COLLEGES AND CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING SEVERAL. BUDGET AND FUNDING ISSUES FACING THE LEGISLATURE. SO YOU CAN SEE FROM PAGE ONE OF THE HANDOUT. THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF BIG EVENTS US SUCH AS VOTER INITIATIVES ECONOMIC UPSWINGS AND RECESSIONS THAT HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN SHAPING COLLEGE FUNDING. THAT'S A HAND OUT NOTES AT THE TOP AT ONE TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGES RELIED PRIMARILY ON LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES FOR THEIR FUNDING. THAT WAS WHEN DISTRICTS HAD THE POWER COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICTS HAD THE POWER. SET THEIR OWN PROPERTY TAX RATES EACH YEAR. THIS CHANGED ABRUPTLY IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION. THIRTEEN AS YOU KNOW PROPOSITION THIRTEEN CAP TO THE PROPERTY TAX RATE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS COULD CHARGE. PROPOSITION THIRTEEN ALSO LIMITED LOCAL GROWTH OF PROPERTY TAX [inaudible] A RATES I SIGN THE STATE THE TASK OF ALLOCATING PROPERTY TAX REVENUES THANK REALLY CREATED FOR THE LEGISLATURE A MUCH GREATER ROLE. IN TERMS OF FINDING THE COLLEGES WITH STATE GENERAL FUND MONIES. AND THROUGH THE YEARS THE STATE'S ECONOMIC SITUATION HAS HAD A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING. IN GOOD TIMES THE COLLEGES GENERALLY HAVE SEEN AN UPSWING IN REVENUES AND SPENDING ABILITY. AND THEN DOWN TIMES MOST NOTABLY THE RECENT THAT GREAT RECESSION IN THE STATE COLLEGES HAVE EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN CUTS. AS THE MIDDLE OF PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT INDICATES AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT ROAMING FI WHICH WAS ABOUT. FIVE DOLLARS AT THE TIME. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL AS K. TWELVE EDUCATION HAVE BEEN GOVERNED BY ANOTHER PROPOSITION THAT'S PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES A MINIMUM LEVEL OF ANNUAL FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND K.. TWELVE SO IF YOU GO TO PAGE. TWO YOU'LL SEE AN A GRAPHIC FORM HOW FUNDING SOURCES HAVE CHANGED OVER A FIFTY YEAR PERIOD. AS FROM THE NIGHT MID NINETEEN SIXTIES THROUGH. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND FUNDING HERE IS PRESENTED AS A SYSTEM WIDE AVERAGE PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT. THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION SO YOU CAN COMPARE THE AMOUNTS OVER TIME. IN THE AREA OF THE GRAPH LABELED LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES YOU CONCEIVE THE AFFECT OF PROPOSITION. THIRTEEN A ON FUNDING YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT STEEP A CLIP IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND THAT'S KIND OF DARKER GRAY AREA YOU CAN ALSO SEE HOW STUDENTS FEES BEGAN TO PLAY A ROLE IN COLLEGE FUNDING ALBEIT A RELATIVELY SMALL ROLE. AND AS YOU'LL HEAR IN THE SECOND PANEL THAT'S BECAUSE HISTORICALLY COMMITTEE COLLEGE FEES HAVE BEEN THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY ARE AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRIES. AND THE COUNTRY AND THE STATE WAIVES THE FEE FOR STUDENTS WHO DEVON STEVAN STRAIGHT FINANCIAL NEED. AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE THERE TOWARD THE END OF THE GRAPH THE IMPACT OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED FUNDING FOR STUDENTS. AND THEY HAVE QUITE SO SIGNIFICANT WAY. AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO SEE THOUGH AT THE TAIL END OF THE GRAPH YOU CAN SEE THE THE INCREASE IN FUNDING PER STUDENT THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND THAT WHEN THIS GRAPH ENDS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN PER STUDENT FUNDING IS IT AS IS AT ITS HIGHEST RATE. ARE. THROUGHOUT THESE FIFTY YEARS SINCE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT. PAGE THREE PAGE THREE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF HOW FUNDING IS ALLOCATED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE TOP PART OF THE PAGE NOTES THAT HISTORICALLY MOST FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED TWO COLLEGES AS GENERAL PURPOSE MONIES WHICH THE COLLEGES CALL APPORTIONMENT. OVER THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS DESIGNATED MORE AND MORE FUNDING FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES. FROM STUDENT SERVICES TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO FACILITIES MAINTENANCE. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES BEFORE PROPOSITION. THIRTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES ONLY HAD ONE CATEGORICAL PROGRAM THAT WAS A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAM AIMED AT LOW INCOME -- ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. BY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE HE CREATED NEARLY. THIRTY A CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 25% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR COR BUDGET. NOW LARGELY AS A RESULT OF TAX BASE DIFFERENCES THAT PREDATE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN HISTORICALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE RECEIVE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF FUNDING. A PER STUDENT TO SERVE THEIR STUDENTS. IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED FUNDING OVER A SEVERAL YEAR PERIOD TO EQUALIZE PER STUDENT FUNDING ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND JUST TO NOTE THAT THIS EFFORT AFFECTED APPORTIONMENT FUNDING FOR CREDIT IN STRUCK XIN WHICH IS LARGELY COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES. DISTRICTS ALREADY HAD BEEN RECEIVING THE SAME PER STUDENT AMOUNT FOR NONCREDIT INSTRUCTION WITCHES ARE LARGELY PRE COLLEGIATE ADULT LEVEL TYPE CLASSES. HISTORICALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE RECEIVED A PORTION FUNDS BASED ON ENROLLMENT. FUNDING THAT WAY HAS CREATED A STRONG INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO STUDENTS. BUT THERE'S BEEN CRITICISM OVER THE YEARS THAT FUNDING BASED ON ENROLLMENT DOESN'T CREATE A STRONG INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS SUCCESSFULLY MAKE IT THROUGH A PROGRAM AND EARNED A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. SO JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR AGREED TO FUND COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPORTIONMENT SPACE AT LEAST IN PART ON STUDENT OUTCOMES SUCH AS DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE ACHIEVEMENT. AND AS THE HEAD OUT DOES NOTE NONCREDIT APPORTIONMENT CONTINUES TO BE BASED ENTIRELY ON ENROLLMENT. NOW THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA ALSO GIVES A SUPPLEMENTAL PER STUDENT AMOUNTS FOR COLLEGES ARE SERVING LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO EACH LOW INCOME STUDENTS COLLEGE SERVES GETS AT A BUMP IN IN THE AMOUNT OF PROPORTIONATE FUNDING IT RECEIVES A GRAD. AGAIN FOR CREDIT INSTRUCTION. AND THIS IS TO RECOGNIZE A GENERALLY HIGHER COSTS THAT COLLEGE IS IN HER TO EDUCATE THE STUDENTS. ALONG WITH THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA THE LEGISLATURE CONSOLIDATED THREE STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS INTO A BLOCK GRANT. THAT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE. THREE SO PAGE FOR A REALLY TAKES A LOOK AT YOU IN LIGHT OF THIS HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN LIGHT OF RECENT BUDGET RELATED CHANGES. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES FACING THE LEGISLATURE? THE FIRST IS THE HAND OUT A AS NOTED OVER THE YEARS COMMITTEE COLLEGE FUNDING HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY RECESSIONS AND STRONGLY AFFECTED BY RECESSIONS. THE MAIN PROTECTION AGAINST CUTS DURING RECESSIONS IS A STRONG RESERVE AND BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE STATE WILL HAVE. A TOTAL RESERVE OF ABOUT SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. AS YOU'LL HEAR A WAY AGAIN WHEN YOU DISCUSS THE UNIVERSITIES AND IMPORTANT ONGOING ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. IS WHAT LEVEL OF RESERVES TO SHOOT FOR IN THE COMING YEARS. SECOND THE LEGISLATURE FACES AN ONGOING QUESTION OF HOW MUCH FUNDING IS PROVIDED VIA APPORTIONMENT AS OPPOSED TO CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. NOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFICIALS TENDER [inaudible] PREFER APPORTIONMENT GIVE THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS LOCAL PRIORITIES OF THE ADVANTAGE OF RESTRICTION AS RESTRICTED FUNDING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN TARGET FUNDS [inaudible] FOR STATEWIDE PRIORITIES. THIRD THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO MONITOR CLOSELY THE EFFECTS OF THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA ON COLLEGE OPERATIONS AND STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES TO RESOLVE IS WHETHER NONCREDIT INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE FUNDED AS A BASE AT LEAST BASED IN PART ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. NOW RELATED TO THE ISSUES OF BOTH SPENDING FLEXIBILITY AND THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA. OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO DECIDE WHETHER OTHER CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED SOME OF THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN OR SO THAT ARE STILL INTACT. THE LAST POINT ON PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND OUT CONCERNS FUNDED INSTRUCTION AND WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PROMOTE MORE NONTRADITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES STRATEGIES THROUGH ITS FUNDING POLICIES. FOR EXAMPLE BEST PRACTICES IN OTHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS IDENTIFY COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AND PRIOR LEARNING ASSESSMENT SUCH AS CHALLENGE TESTS ON COURSES. AS A WAY TO ACCELERATE STUDENT PROGRESS YET CURRENTLY COLLEGES DO NOT HAVE A STRONG FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO LET ALREADY SKILLED STUDENTS BYPASS CERTAIN CLASSES IN PURSUIT OF A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. ALSO LOOKING AHEAD THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO REVISIT HOW FUNDING POLICIES CAN BETTER SUPPORT NONTRADITIONAL INSTRUCTION AND THIS GOES TO YOUR POINT AT THE BEGINNING IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS THAT MISTER CHAIR ABOUT. AYE WAIT LOOKING FOR WAYS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATECAN RESPOND TO INNOVATIVE CHANGES THAT. THAT HAVE NEVER PREVIOUSLY BEEN ENVISIONED SO THERE THERE MIGHT BE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE WE HAVEN'T EVEN DISSIPATED NOW AND JUST KEEPING. THE POLICIES AND THE LEGISLATIVE AYE ON SOME OF THOSE DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY OCCUR THANK YOU. JASON CONCENTRA SALLY ó. MY PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS ON THE TWO UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS AND I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT HAND OUT ON THAT THAT'S YES YOU AND YOU SEE MAJOR BUDGET TRENDS. THE FORMAT OF MY PRESENTATION WILL BE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HEARD IN THE CCC PRESENTATION. OF FOCUS FIRST ON A MAJOR FUNDING DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE YEARS ALL THEN FOCUS ON HOW CHANGES IN THE WAYS THE STATE HAS DETERMINED HOW MUCH FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE TO UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS. AND THEN I'LL CONCLUDE WITH SOME AREAS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS YOU REVIEW BUDGET PRACTICES FOR THE TO UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS. ONE THING NOTE TO KNOW JUST BEFORE I DELVE INTO THE HAND OUT OF MY PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON WHAT WE REFER TO AS CORE FUNDING. THAT IS STATE FUNDING AND STUDENT TUITION AND FEES THESE TWO SOURCES OF FUNDS ARE WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THE EDUCATION BUDGETS. CRAWFORD CS YOU AND YOU SEE. OTHER MORE SELF SUPPORTING ENTITIES SUCH AS FEDERAL FUNDS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS MEDICAL CENTERS STUDENT HOUSING AND THE DINING AND RECREATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES LIKE THAT WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRESENTATION. RETURNING TO PAGE ONE WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE KEYED A DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE YEARS OF INVOLVING CORE FUNDING. I THINK YOU CAN CHARACTERIZE ALL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE YEARS AND IT INTO KEY TRENDS THE FIRST IS. OVERALL CORE FUNDING FOR A CSU AND YOU SEE. OVERALL CORE FUNDING HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT VOLATILE OVER THE YEARS INCREASING WHEN OF STATE REVENUES WERE GENERALLY STRONG AND DECREASING WHEN STATE REVENUES WERE GENERALLY WEAK. AMONG OTHER VOLATILITY HAS ESPECIALLY BEEN ON THE EDGE THE STATE GENERAL FUND SIDE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT A FUNDING PER STUDENT OVER TIME OF TUITION AND FEES HAVE TENDED TO BE A SOMEWHAT MORE -- A STABLE REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE UNIVERSITIES. AND SECONDLY IN TERMS A MIX OF CORE FUNDING -- BETWEEN STATE GENERAL FUND AND STUDENT TUITION AND FEES. BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OVER TIME STUDENT TUITION AND FEES HAVE BECOME INCREASING SHARE OF CORE FUNDING. NOW THAT SAID. A WE WOULD NOTE THAT AS OF TUITION AND FEES HAVE INCREASED SO HAS FINANCIAL AID SPENDING AND YOU'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FINANCIAL AID IN YOUR NEXT PANEL. A BUT AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE INCREASE IN TUITION FEES OVER TIME I KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF THAT IS A GENUINE COST INCREASE FOR CERTAIN CALIFORNIANS AND HOUSEHOLDS. BUT OTHER OTHER PORTIONS OF THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE STATE OR BEEN REDIRECTED BACK TO STUDENTS IN THE FORM OF FINANCIAL AID. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO I WE PROVIDE A A GRAPH THAT YOU SAW SIMILAR TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PREFER CSCO. AT SHOW STATE OF FUNDING AND A STUDENT TUITION AND FEES OVER TIME. AND HERE AGAIN YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THE TRENDS ARE HIGHLIGHTED YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S BEEN SOMEWHAT VOLATILE OVER THE YEARS. I WAS CERTAIN PEAK SUCH AS IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND ALSO IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS FOLLOWED BY A DECLINES IN PER STUDENT FUNDING. GENERALLY CORRESPONDING TWO YEARS WERE THEIR RECESSIONS ARE THERE WERE BUDGET REDUCTIONS AND YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THAT VOLATILITY IS BENT ON THE STATE FUNDING SIDE. LIKEWISE YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT TUITION AND FEES OVER TIME HAVE BEEN AN INCREASING SHARE OF CORE FUNDING. AND ALSO TO CIRCLE BACK TO THAT POINT AND MADE ON FINANCIAL AID SPENDING AND TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT OF THAT A STUDENT TUITION AND FEES LINE IS ACTUALLY BEING REDIRECTED FOR FINANCIAL AID EITHER. BEING COVERED BY THE STATE'S CAL GRANT PROGRAM WORKING BRAG REDIRECTED BACK TO STUDENTS SO THAT JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BEING BORNE BY -- BY STUDENTS VERSES AB HADN'T BEEN FOR FINANCIALLY PROGRAM. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF THAT HAND OUT YOU'LL SEE A SIMILAR TABLE FOR YOU SEE AGAIN THE TRENDS ARE VERY SIMILAR YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF A NOTABLE VOLATILITY IN THE OVERALL LEVEL OF CORE FUNDING. AND YOU ALSO SEE AGAIN -- THE INCREASING SHARE OF STUDENT TUITION AND FEES AND AND COVERING COR FUNDS. AGAIN JUST A CIRCLE BACK TO THAT POINT ON FINANCIAL AID ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT -- AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IS IN THE IN THE STUDENTS TO IT AND FEES CATEGORY IS ACTUALLY BEING USED FOR FINANCIAL AID EITHER THROUGH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM ARE BEING REDIRECTED BACK TO STUDENTS FOR FINANCIAL AID. TURNING TO PAGE FOUR OF THE HANDOUT WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE WAYS THE STATE HAS BUDGETED. I THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES OUR OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS WAS A LOT MORE FORMULA DRIVEN -- THE EVER EVER EVER NEW STUDENT THAT THE UNIVERSITIES AND ROLL THEY'VE GOT A CERTAIN SUBSIDY FOR THAT NEW STUDENTS -- THERE WERE ADDITIONAL -- FUNDS FOR VARIOUS COST INCREASES SUCH AS COMPENSATION INCREASES ANYTIME THERE IS A NEW PROGRAM ADDED THERE IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT. AND EVERY AND FOR CERTAIN FACILITY PROJECTS EVERY TIME THERE IS A NEW FACILITY THAT WAS PROPOSED AND ADOPTED IN THE BUDGET THERE WAS FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT NEW FACILITY PROJECT. BEGIN IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES A LOT OF THIS FORMULA DRIVEN APPROACH -- STARTED TO DECLINE AND AND GIVEAWAYS TO A MORE FLEXIBLE BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S. OF AN EVOLVING A MORE NEGOTIATED PROCESS BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT -- AND ALSO IT AND IN DOING SO THE LEGISLATURE A DEFAULT A LOT OF THAT A CONTROL IT HAD OVER THE BUDGETS REALLY GAVE MORE CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THE SEGMENTS TO MANAGE THEIR COST INCREASES. SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF THE OLD ENROLLMENT FORMULAS WERE VERY DETAILED AND PROVIDE A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SUBSIDIES DEPENDING ON IF THE STUDENT WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE OR GRADUATE. AND ARE STANDING IS IN SOME CASES EVEN IF THE STUDENT WAS ENROLLED IN A CERTAIN DISCIPLINE LIKE AT SCIENCE OR HUMANITY. ON IN THE MID NINETIES THE LEGISLATURE REVISE THAT A FORMULA AND CREATED A MUCH SIMPLER FORMULA FOR BOTH SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDED ONE SUBSIDY FOR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR UNDERGRADUATES AND GRADUATES. THEY GIVE THE SECOND MORE CONTROL TO MANAGE ROMANS ACROSS THE SYSTEMS. AND IN CERTAIN YEARS THE STATE HAS NOT SET ROMAN TARGETS IN THE BUDGET OR DESIGNATED FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH I MET ALSO GIVES PUTS MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE SEGMENTS TO REALLY. SET THAT AS A PRIORITY OF THEMSELVES. LIKEWISE FOR OTHER EXPERT OF COST INCREASES ARE NOT RELATED TO ENROLLMENT SUCH AS COMPENSATION COSTS IN RECENT YEARS A LOT OF THE OF THE SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO COVER THOSE COSTS THROUGH. A GENERAL PURPOSE BASED INCREASES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THEM GENERALLY IS BASED INCREASES ARE DETERMINED ON A SOMEWHAT NEGOTIATED BASIS A PARTICULARLY AT IN RECENT YEARS IT'S BEEN VERY MUCH THAT DIRECTED BY. OF THE ADMINISTRATION IMPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THING THAT. PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS THAT IT SEES FIT THOSE YEARS -- LIKEWISE FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS ON A LOT OF THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT EXISTED IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS -- THROUGHOUT THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES ALSO THAT WERE ADDED IN TWO THOUSANDS A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE FOLDED INTO THE UNIVERSITIES GENERAL PURPOSE SUPPORT AND OF A SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THOSE PLOT OF THIS PROGRAM STILL EXIST BUT THE FUNDING IS NOW IN THE CONTROL OF THE SEGMENTS OF THE SEGMENTS REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING FUNDS TO THOSE PROGRAMS IN REVIEWING THEIR CONTINUE NEED. AND THEN FOR FACILITIES OF THE STATE AS A FEW YEARS AGO A REVISED THE WAY IT IT -- REVIEWS FACILITIES AND IT GIVES A LOT MORE GIVE A LOT MORE CONTROL OF THE SEGMENTS. TO APPROVE NEW FACILITY PROJECTS AS PART OF THAT PROCESS ALSO GAVE THE SEGMENTS MORE RESPONSIBILITY. FUND THOSE NEW PROJECTS. NOW IN ADDITION TO THAT TREND -- I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT I'M YOU'VE HEARD SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SOMEWHAT DISCUSSION IS ALSO EXISTED IN OF ON THE UNIVERSITY SIDE. OTHER STATE FEW YEARS AGO DEVELOPED PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT THE UNIVERSITIES MUST REPORT ON EACH YEAR THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES. LIKE GRADUATION RATES LOWER O. INCOME STUDENT ENROLLMENT THE UNITS THAT STUDENTS ACCUMULATE WHEN THEY GRADUATE OTHER VARIOUS MEASURES OF THAT SORT. CURRENTLY THE SEGMENTS REPORT ON THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND ITS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES -- UNLIKE THE NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE FORMULA THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AREN'T REALLY INTEGRATED ANY SORT OF BUDGET FORMULA OR ANY OTHER SORT OF WAY WE BUDGET FOR THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE SORT OF INFORMATIONAL AT THIS POINT. SO SKIPPING ACTUALLY HERB PITCH FIVE MOVING TO PAGE SIX FOR THE SAKE OF TIME. I'M ONE OF THE TOUCH ON SOME KEY AREAS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS A REVIEWING BUDGET PRACTICES FOR THE UNIVERSITIES -- MY COLLEAGUE PAUL ALREADY DISCUSSED. THAT FIRST POINT ABOUT SETTING AN OVERALL RESERVE JUST AS THAT MIGHT CONTROL SOME VOLATILITY FOR THE COLLEGES ALSO CONTROLS IT IT COULD HELP YOU SOME OF THE VOLATILITY FOR THE UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS. AND SECONDLY AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BUDGETING YOU MAY WISH TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT OF THE STATE HAS BUDGETED FOR THE UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS IN THE PRO AND THE APPROACH THAT YOU THINK MAKES MOST SENSE TO YOU. WHETHER OR NOT THE OLD FORMULA DRIVEN APPROACH MADE SENSE OF WHETHER THE CURRENTLY THEM MORE NEGOTIATED -- SYSTEM MAKES SENSE AND IN DOING SO YOU MAY WISH TO REVIEW WHAT LEVEL OF CONTROL YOU'D LIKE TO EXERT OVER THE UNIVERSITY'S. OUR STATE OTHER AS YOUR BUDGET ADVISER. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING THE PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET PRIORITIES OF THE SEGMENTS. I'M SO THE UESTION FOR YOU IS REALLY HOW MUCH CONTROL YOU LIKE OVER THESE VERY VERY VERY SERIOUS HOW MUCH CONTROL YOU LIKE OVER SETTING ENROLLMENT TARGETS. REVIEWING COMPENSATION LEVELS. AND POSSIBLY REVIEWS IT RIP REVIEWING OTHER POLICIES TO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE VERY RECENTLY HAS USED THE BUDGET PROCESS TO REVIEW THINGS LIKE NON RESIDENT ROLE MEANT. PENSION BENEFITS FOR YOU SEE EMPLOYEES AND VERY RECENTLY ADOPTED -- A CATEGORICAL LINE ITEM FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S OTHERS ARE SOME WAYS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- TRY TO RE EXERT SOME CONTROL OVER THE BUDGET PROCESS -- OFFER REGARDING PERFORMANCE A BASED BUDGETING YOU MAY WISH TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH IT SEGMENTS REPORT INFORMATION. IS REASONABLE OR WHETHER OR NOT OF THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO DO MORE. TO INTEGRATE PERFORMANCE MEASURES INTO THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND THEN FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE FACES THE PERENNIAL ISSUE OF HOW TO SHARE COSTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND STUDENTS WHAT SO BUT LOOK PORTION OF THIS OF COURSE FUND SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE STATE WHAT PORTION SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY STUDENTS. RECOGNIZING THAT FINANCIAL AID DOES COVER THE COSTS FOR STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND SO FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO AREN'T. FINANCIALLY NEEDY UNDER THOSE PROGRAMS. WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SHOULD THE OF COST OF THOSE STUDENTS A PAY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR EDUCATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISSILES ANA. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BERMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MONEY COME THOSE SIGN UP PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE FUTURES FOUNDATION. THE COLLEGE FUTURES FOUNDATION STANDS FOR EQUITY OF OPPORTUNITY AN OUTCOME FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE STUDENTS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS K. TWELVE STUDENTS ARE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME YET THE STUDENTS FACE NUMEROUS BARRIERS TO ATTAINING BACHELOR'S DEGREES. AND FORM A MINORITY OF GRADUATES FROM OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. A HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE COLLEGE EDUCATION MEANS OPPORTUNITY. AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES YET NUMEROUS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND STATES YET TOO MANY. QUALIFIED STUDENTS CANNOT ACCESS SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS IN HOW WE FINANCE HIGHER EDUCATION. THE COLLEGE FUTURES FOUNDATION BEGAN EXAMINING COLLEGE FINANCE BECAUSE OF GROWING CONCERNS AT THE SYSTEM OF PAIN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BECOME A BARRIER TO INCREASING BACHELOR DEGREE ATTAINMENT. AMONG ALL STUDENTS AND HAS BECOME PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR LOW INCOME AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. THIS LET US TO WORK ON THE TOPIC OF HIGHER ED FINANCE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ELEMENTS AND THE ISSUES AND WAYS TO EXPLORE SOLVING IT. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE CSU AND THE UC WHICH EDUCATES NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE STATE'S BACCALAUREATE RECIPIENTS. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE CONVENED A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH DEEP EXPERTISE ON PUBLIC POLICY AND HIGHER ED FINANCE. AND COMMISSION SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF RESEARCH MY COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE A REFLECTION OF THIS ANALYSIS AND THE EXPLORATION OF THE ISSUES. A GROWING CONCERN. THE HIGHER IT FINANCE PROBLEM HAS WORSENED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS BECAUSE OF GROWING STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN REVENUES AND SPENDING. AS WE HEARD HIM FLUSH ECONOMIC TIMES THE STATE CAMPAIGN MORE TUITIONS HOLD STEADY AND COLLEGE ENROLLMENT IS EASIER IN BAD TIMES THE STATUS FORCED TO MAKE DRASTIC BUDGET CUTS INSTITUTIONS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO CAN BE ADMITTED. AND TUITION SKYROCKET. WHEN GOOD TIMES RETURN SPENDING INCREASES AGAIN INTUITIONS ARE HELD STEADY BUT NOTHING FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES SO WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION ROLLS AROUND? THE CYCLE THE BUDGET CUTS TUITION INCREASES AND ENROLLMENT COMEBACK CUT BACKS REPEAT. NO ONE IS WELL SERVED BY THIS WILD RIDE OF HIGHS AND LOWS NOT CALIFORNIA FAMILIES NOT THE STATE NOT THE INSTITUTIONS OR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THEM AND MOST PARTICULARLY. NOT STUDENTS WE MUST FIND A BETTER WAY TO MANAGE HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCE ENROLLMENT LEVELS. AND TUITION BY TAKING ON PREDICTABILITY OF REVENUES ADOPTED BUDGET BY OFFERING PRACTICE SAYS AND RIGOROUS CROSSED MANAGED COST MANAGEMENT. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS. WE SEE FOR ASPECTS TO THE FINANCE CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES. VOLATILE REVENUE PATTERNS INCLUDING STRETCHES OF DECLINING STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUES LINKED WITH GROWING DEPENDENCE ON TUITION. BUDGETING PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIXED COSTS OF EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. ACADEMIC OR INSTRUCTIONAL COST STRUCTURES. AND STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL DECISION MAKING THAT FUNCTIONS WITHOUT SHARED MEASURES COMMON GOALS AND MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY. GIVEN THE SOLUTIONS THAT REQUIRE ATTENTION TO ALL FOUR OF THESE BARRIERS BUT THOSE TIME LIMITS THAT I HAVE I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THREE OF THEM. REVENUE INSTABILITY COST MANAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY IN DECISION MAKING FINALLY ARE CLOSE WITH THE SHORT ANALYSIS AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEMS. OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES FACE IN TERMS OF CAPITAL FINANCE WHICH WE MUST ADDRESS IF WE TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWING DEMAND FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION REVENUE VOLATILITY. AND A GROWING DEPENDENCE ON TUITION THIS IS THE MOST WIDELY DOCUMENTED AND BEST UNDERSTOOD FAST OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCE PROBLEM. THE UNPREDICTABLE STATE REVENUE LEVELS LINK TO INCREASES IN TUITION BY UNIVERSITIES. AS YOU'VE HEARD THE SOURCES OF REVENUE IN CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL FUND HAVE SHIFTED SUBSTANTIALLY AND OF RECENT DECADES. A PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND HIGH INCOME TAXPAYER THE INCOME EARNED BY THESE TAXPAYERS IS MORE DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL GAINS MAKING THE GENERAL FUND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED IN ECONOMIC BOOMS AND BUSTS. THIS WAS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN STATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SHRANK 4% BUT GENERAL FUND REVENUES DECLINED BY MORE THAN 19%. AS GENERAL FUNDS DROP TUITION STARTS TO STUDENTS INCREASED AND TUITION IS NOW THE LARGEST REVENUE SOURCE FOR CORE PROGRAMS IN THE UC AND HALF OF COR REVENUES AT THE CSU. AND GIVEN THAT MAJOR TAX REFORM IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY WE MUST FIND WAYS TO BUFFER AGAINST THESE INEVITABLE PRECIPITOUS DECLINES. BUDGET AND PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH FIXED COSTS. BOTH STATE UNIVERSITY BUDGET PRACTICES TREAT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AS FIXED COSTS WHICH MEANS AIR FUNDED AHEAD OF OTHER PRIORITIES. EVEN AS REVENUE HAS BECOME LESS PREDICTABLE A LARGER SHARE IS NEEDED TO PAY FOR THE FIX BECAUSE OF EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PENSIONS AND RETIREE HEALTH CARE. BENEFIT LEVELS HAVE IMPROVED. BUT THE PRIMARY COST DRIVER HAS BEEN THE COST OF HEALTHCARE AND CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES THAT NOW REQUIRE BENEFITS COMMITTED TO BE RETIREES TO BE SHOWN AS INSTITUTIONAL LIVE BILL IT IS OUR DEBTS. PENSION GUARANTEES PENSION BENEFITS ARE GUARANTEES AND CANNOT BE REDUCED FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES OUR RETIREES NOR WOULD WE RECOMMEND THAT. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM A SPENDING ON BENEFITS IS WELL RECOGNIZED WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY AND WHATEVER CHANGES THAT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN MUST HAPPEN SLOWLY OVER THE YEARS. STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL DECISION MAKING STAYED IN INSTITUTIONAL DECISION MAKERS TOO OFTEN ARE WORKING ACROSS PURPOSES WITHOUT COMMENT CALLS SHARED LANGUAGE OF MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY. STATE GOVERNMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION ARE COMPLEX SYSTEMS THAT RELY ON MULTIPLE DECISION MAKERS AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF AUTHORITY. THE ABSENCE OF SHARED GOALS COMMON FISCAL BENCHMARKS IN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS HAMPER ATTEMPTS TO ADEQUATELY PLAN FOR AND MANAGE RESOURCES IN A WAY TO ADVANCE [inaudible] STUDENT SUCCESS. THE WAY FORWARD. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CHALLENGE WE THINK A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. THAT INCLUDES REVENUE BY OFFERING TUITION STABILIZATION AND PREDICTABILITY COST MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS ARE REQUIRED. TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE. REVENUE AND TUITION PREDICTABILITY THE STATE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD ADDRESS. REVENUES MOVING TO REDUCE VOLATILITY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND BUILD BETTER PREDICTABILITY FOR INSTITUTIONAL LEADERS. THIS SHOULD OCCUR THROUGH A COMBINATION OF MODERATE AND PREDICTABLE INCREASES IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FROM THE STATE. MODERATE AND PREDICTABLE INCREASES IN TUITION BY COHORT ACCOMPANIED BY NEED BASED AID TO PROTECT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND INCREASES IN THE CONTINGENCY RESERVES DEDICATED TO HIGHER EDUCATION. THE LONG STANDING HABIT OF BUYING OUT TUITION IN GOOD TIMES AND LETTING THE LEVEL SPIKE IN RECESSIONS NATURE AND STUDENTS THE INSTITUTIONS AND OUR STATE. ARE BETTER SERVED THROUGH MODEST AND PREDICTABLE ANNUAL INCREASES IN TUITION. MATCHED WITH SAME SIZE GROWTH IN STATE FUNDING. AND THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SHOULD BE AT REVISED TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND TO ILLUMINATE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN SPENDING ON BENEFITS AND OTHER OPTIONS. INCLUDING SALARIES NEW FACULTY POSITIONS LOWER INCREASES IN STUDENT TUITIONS EXCEPT TRACK. SO WE BELIEVE THAT A COMPREHENSIVE PROBLEM REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION AND ILLUMINATING BOTH THE COST AND THE REVENUE SIDE AND THE LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING REQUIRED IN SHARED GOVERNANCE. IS THE PATH FORWARD. NOW LET ME TURN VERY QUICKLY TO CAPITAL FINANCE. I'VE JUST DISCUSSED WITH HIM. THE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS. OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM REVENUE VOLATILITY EMPLOYEE SALARIES BENEFITS EXCEPT FOR BUT THERE IS ANOTHER MASSIVE EXPENSE LOOMING ON THE HORIZON. WHICH HAS TO DO WITH EXPANDING FACILITIES AT OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WE NEED A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO PAY FOR RENOVATIONS REPAIRS AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BEGINNING WITH DECISIONS ABOUT REVENUE SOURCES AND WAYS TO ESTABLISH FUNDING PRIORITIES. THIS REQUIREMENT IS MADE EVEN MORE APPARENT BY THE FACT THAT OUR COLLEGES ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE DEMAND OF GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE SLOTS. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE GRADUATION RATES HAVE NOW SHOWN SUCH DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT. THE PROPORTION OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES HAVE COMPLETED THE COURSES REQUIRED ADMISSION TO UC AND CSU CAMPUSES HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE A PLACE OUT OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FOR THESE QUALIFIED STUDENTS. IT WILL BE CHALLENGING BUT IT IS BOTHNECESSARY AND DO A BALL AND THAT THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE. SO THE NEEDS IN CAPITAL FINANCING IN HIGHER ED -- ENORMOUS AND GROWING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE UC IN THE CSU HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THEY WILL NEED A COMBINED FORTY SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION. TO CONSTRUCT NEW FACILITIES ARE MODERNIZE EXISTING FACILITIES IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ALONE. THE GROWTH IN UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. NEEDS TO BE ACCOMMODATED WE NEED TO FUND ALLOCATIONS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT AND CLEAR. AND THE HISTORIC SEPARATION BETWEEN OPERATING AND CAPITAL BUDGETS ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE FUNDING PROBLEM. AND OF COURSE AS WE ARE NOW DEFERRED MAY NEEDS ARE GROWING AN ON GOING BASIS AND MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN CUT SIGNIFICANTLY. SO WHAT OTHER CHALLENGES THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE CURRENT APPROACH. TO HIGHER EDUCATION CAPITAL FINANCE. TOWARDS AB MUCH MORE WELL DEFINED SYSTEMIC APPROACH. COLLEGE FUTURES FOUNDATION IS TODAY INVOLVED IN A RESEARCH PROJECT TO DIDN'T DETERMINE THE CAPACITY CHALLENGE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. TO TWENTY THIRTY THIS INCLUDES ASSESSING CONTRIBUTORS TO DEMAND AND SUPPLY ALONG WITH WAYS FOR BETTER UTILIZATION OF FACILITIES ACROSS HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS INCLUDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE MUST BE INNOVATIVE WAYS TO MAXIMIZE SPACE AND COORDINATE BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. SO IN CONCLUSION. THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE HANGS ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE A QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERY STUDENT WHO IS QUALIFIED AND MOTIVATED TO SEEK A COLLEGE DEGREE. SOLUTIONS MUST INCLUDE A FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY AND TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WHICH I KNOW OUR NEXT PANELIST PREPARED TO ADDRESS. BUT ACHIEVING SOLUTIONS POSED BY THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION REQUIRES A SYSTEMATIC AND THOUGHTFUL APPROACH. THAT TAKES THE LONG VIEW. AND IT'S HEARTENING TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE. TAKING THE ISSUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCE SERIOUSLY AND EXPLORING THOUGHTFUL SOLUTIONS TO REAFFIRM OUR STATE AND THE MASTER PLANS COMMITMENT TO ACCESS OF OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MISS LOZANO LOZANO -- AND I LIKE TO RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN US -- TODAY AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY DE MAKE ANY INTRODUCTORY REMARKS THEY WANT OR ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- BUT WE HAVE US IN THE MEMBER MEDINA CLOSE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE WE HAVE DOCTOR WEBER WHO'S A MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN HAS BEEN I THINK EVERY HEARING -- WE HAVE -- SOME MEMBER MCCARTY WHO'S NOT A MEMBER CHAIR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WILL -- OVERSEEING BUDGET EFFORT FOR EDUCATION AND CALIFORNIA -- AND DOCTOR EGGMAN -- WHO'S ALSO BEEN I THINK PRACTICALLY EVERY HERE AND WE'VE HAD -- SO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY AND WHEN I OPEN IT UP TO YOU FOR ANY. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WORSE I GROUP TODAY -- GO. FOR WELL FIRST OF ALL THAT I'M NOT A MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE BUT I THINK YOU -- FOR NOT INVITING YOU BUT SHARING IT AND YOU KNOW ASKING AT ASKING THE SPEAKER TO US TO FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE -- THAT THE MASTER PLAN. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IS A DOCUMENT SIXTY YEARS ALL THOSE NEVER QUITE CODIFIED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT KIND OF ARE BLUEPRINT. I THINK IT BEGS THE QUESTION -- Y. WITH THE CREDIT SIX YEARS AGO DOESN'T MEET THE THAT THEY GOALS OF TODAY -- BACK THEN IT WASN'T PEOPLE THE FIGHTING EVEN AT HIGHER EDUCATION AS MUCH AS WE DO. NOT KNOW TODAY AND WE KNOW IT'S THE TICKET TO KNOWLEDGE AND THE WHOLE CLASS JOB BUT HARD. ECONOMIC AB. WELDING OF THE FUTURE AND THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'VE INCREASED HIGHER ED SPENDING IN UC AND CSU MANY COLLEGES BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. WHEN YOU HAD ARE INCREASING CAL GRANT IT'S TWO TWO BILLION BUT? THE WORLD'S ARE TREMENDOUS ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. IS IS STILL A HUGE ISSUE WE'RE HEARING IT HERE AND HERE FOR THE NEXT PANEL -- AS WELL. AND I THINK THIS. IS REALLY THAT THE STATE'S FROM WHERE WE WANT TO GO WE DO HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION COMING IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS -- SO I THINK -- IT ALLOWS US TO TALK ABOUT -- OUR PRIORITIES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION I KNOW A LOT OF THESE YOU KNOW THAT SWIRLS AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT AND WHERE IS THE MAGIC. POT OF MONEY IN ISRAEL HIDDEN SUITCASE UNDER HERE WITH A COUPLE BILLION FOR HIGHER AT DURING THE BUDGET SUFFER FOR YEARS I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT STILL I'M STILL LOOKING FOR IT. BUT BUT YOU DO RAISE SOME ISSUES AT THE AYE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF IS THAT I THINK THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE. A STABLE SOURCE OF STATE MONEY EVERY YEAR TO THE UC AND CSU KNOWS DEBATE THIS PAST YEAR WHETHER IT'S THREE PERCENTER FOR AND YOU KNOW. THE HARD THING IS WE GET 3% AND IT JUST PAYS FOR THE BASICS SPACE FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS YOU BASICALLY DON'T GET ANY. NEW SLOTS FOR STUDENTS WHO DON'T GET ANY INCREASED AFFORDABILITY INOTES CAO LIKE GETTING A BUDGET TO REMODEL YOUR HOUSE AND ALL YOU HAVE IS MONEY FOR YOUR NEW PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL YOU DON'T GET ANY NEW. THINGS THAT YOU'D LIKE FOR YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THAT THAT TACKLE THAT WERE THAT GOOD THE ISSUES ARE TRIED TACKLE IS THAT. SO MUCH OF THE COSTS ARE JUST FOR THE BASICS YOU DON'T EVEN. THE FAMILIES AND ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY AND SO FORTH SO IT SO YOU DID MENTION THE STATE GOING FORWARD. AND HAVING A COMMITMENTS WHETHER IT'S THE STATE'S 5% PER YEAR. GOD INCREASE MONEY WHICH I KNOW THE SYSTEMS WOULD BE VERY PLEASED WITH HE SAID THE STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE. TO PAY IN SOME OUT TO I'M NOT ADVERSE TO THAT I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE SOME FOLKS ARE ARE BARELY ADVERSE TO STUDENT FEE HIKES I I GET IT BUT THERE'S NO. FREE LUNCH HERE ON BUT I WILL NOTE THAT WITH ALL THE STUDENT FEE INCREASE IS GRANTED THAT'S YOU KNOW. SUPER WEALTHY CAN AFFORD IT -- YOU KNOW THE MIDDLE CLASS THE ONES THAT ARE GETTING SQUEEZED IT'S A LOW INCOME ONES THAT GET CAL GRANT AND FINANCIAL AID SO THAT'S COVER ANYWAY. THAT JUST COMES FROM THE STATE AS WELL SO YOU KNOW ALMOST A THIRD TO HALF OF THE MONEY. THAT YOU THAT FOR THAT STUDENT FEE HIKES YET TO COME BACK AND GET CALIFORNIA TO PAY AND IN INTO IT AGAIN. AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS TO THAT AND AND IF THAT IS IF SO THAT MAKES MAYBE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION. MAYBE 6% DRIVEN HIGHER SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S ALL SUSTAINABLE AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK AT COST CONTAINMENT AND YOU SEEN CSU WHAT CAN BE WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT AN AND ENOUGH TO GO AROUND BUT I WILL ASK YOU ON THAT. ON THEM MODERATE AND PREDICTABLE FEE INCREASES IS THERE A CERTAIN. DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT YOU THINK THE THE COLLEGE FEATURES FOUNDATION IS LOOKING THERE IS NO DOLLAR AMOUNT WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS AN APPROACH. AND WERE ACTUALLY -- ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE AND ANOTHER SET OF RESEARCH QUESTIONS. THAT WOULD LOOK AT IT COMPREHENSIVELY SO IF YOU PAT IF YOU MODEL THIS OUT OVER. YEARS WITH THE WORD MULLIN OUT. TO TWENTY THIRTY WHAT WOULD THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COR REVENUE GROWTH BE ON ANY SINGULAR YEAR MATCHED WE WOULD HOPE IN TUITION SO THAT IT'S MODERATE PREDICTABLE. TUITION WOULD HOLD WE WOULD ASSUME FOR A COHORT SO WHEN YOU'RE INCOMING FRESHMEN. YOU BASICALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE PAYING BY THE TIME YOU GRADUATE SO THAT THERE ISN'T THAT KIND OF UNPREDICTABILITY. SO THAT THE PRINCIPLES WOULD BE STABILITY OR REVENUE DOES PREDICTABILITY REDUCED VOLATILITY. AND THEN TO YOUR POINT SENATOR WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT THE COST MANAGEMENT HAS TO BE A PART OF THIS SO PUTTING IN PLACE SOME PRODUCTIVITY MEASURES THAT IF THOSE WERE APPROVED -- THEN IN FACT THERE MIGHT BE SOME RELEASE OF RESERVES HOW WOULD YOU CREATE SOME SORT OF A STABILIZATION FUND SO THESE ARE ALL CONCEPTS THAT WERE. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT. ONE THING BY ITSELF CAN'T SOLVE THIS RIDDLE IT REALLY HAS TO BE COMPREHENSIVE AND SO WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SOME WORK THAT LOOKS AT BOTH. IDENTIFYING WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR RESERVE GIVEN THAT THERE IS AN INEVITABLE DOWNTURN WHAT COULD TUITION LOOK LIKE WHAT SHOULD THE COR REVENUE. STREAM BE IN TERMS OF GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. AND THEN WHAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AROUND COST CONTAINMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY SO ALL OF THAT TOGETHER. PERHAPS COULD BEGIN TO LOOK LIKE. IS THAT -- COULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE PUBLIC THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES AND AND HOPEFULLY THE LEGISLATURE OF IF THAT BE THE CASE. THEN MAYBE HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE LA JOH YA THE GOVERNOR AND EVEN SHE FELT LIKE. LET'S HAVE ANALYSTS SAID THAT YEAH RECESSION MAYBE. COMING ONE DAY AND WE CAN'T COUNT ON THIS. THESE INCREASE WE'VE SEEN FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND SO -- HOW DO YOU VIEW THE LONG TERM FUNDING STRUCTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND? AND HOW WE SHOULD YOU KNOW ADDRESS THIS. THIS COMPLEX -- FINANCE ORBITAL. WELL I THINK WE'D ECHO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT -- CALLED FUTURE JUST NOTED ON I THINK ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES IF YOU IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN THAT VOLATILITY. AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE KEY TOOLS YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL IS. TO SET UP SORT OF RESERVE IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR THAT YOU CAN DRAW ON WHEN TIMES ARE ARE BAD THAT'S THAT'S A KEY TOOL BEFORE YOU AND THINKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW SETTING THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER RESERVE THAT YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT HERBS THAT YOU CAN DRAW ON WHEN WHEN TIMES ARE. BAD AND THAT SORT OF THE THE KEY TO I THINK WE WOULD COURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WAYS. TO HAVE A FUNDING BE MORE PREDICTABLE MUST VOLATILE A MS MEDINA. BUT IT THANK GOD I DON'T FOR COMING AND HER PRESENTATION -- AND AND I THINK THE SUBJECT THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IS PROBABLY TO ME. AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION. OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. AND IN HIGHER EDUCATION. AND AND I HAVE FELT. THAT IN MY SIX YEARS HERE. SERVING ON THE COMMITTEE OF HIGHER ED. AND AND AS THE CHAIR. THAT THERE HAS BEEN. NO MORE IMPORTANT -- POLICY QUESTION THAN JUST THAT THE FUNDING. AND IT IS I AND I HAVE SAID. AND I THINK I'VE SAID IT ALMOST EVERY YEAR THAT IT IS. UP SOMEHOW. TO ME -- JUST [inaudible] SHOCKING REALLY THE THAT THE METHOD THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH. EVERY YEAR TO THAT FUND HIGHER EDUCATION. AND AND I SAY SHOCKING BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS THE EXPERIENCE IS SHOWN -- EVERY EVERY YEAR WE KINDA. STOP BONUS START FROM SCRATCH. IT FEELS THAT WAY -- AND FINDING THE FUNDS TO TO FOR THE TO FIND HIGHER EDUCATION AND SOME YEARS I WE DO BETTER THAN OTHERS. CERTAINLY IN THIS PAST YEAR WE'VE DONE WELL. BUT IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE HAVEN'T DONE SO WELL AND IT SEEMS AND I AM. I THINK IN PERFECT AGREEMENT THAT THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY. AND THAT THAT IS A INCUMBENT UPON THIS AS THE LEGISLATURE TO FIND THAT BETTER WAY. OF THAT WE WE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE. TO DO WHAT WE GO THROUGH EVERY YEAR -- THAN IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. I I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES AND I THINK. I DONE A GOOD JOB OF OF TELLING US WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE -- BUT I YOU KNOW WOULD I COMMIT TO WORKING. WITH THIS CHAIR AND CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OF SUB TO TO FIND A BETTER WAY. AND AND I THINK THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA THE STUDENTS TO CALIFORNIA -- ARE DESERVING OF THE BETTER WAY AND CERTAINLY FOR WHETHER YOU'RE A PARENT. BUT WHETHER YOU'RE STUDENT AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH OF WONDERING YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS TUITION GOING TO GO UP. EVERY YEAR WHILE YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT IS SOMETHING THAT STUDENTS AND PARENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH. SO I I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT. THAT SUBJECT BUT CERTAINLY ONE THAT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. THING YOU'RE MUCH DOCTOR WEBER YES UP BUT I THANK ALL OF YOU FOR FOR THE INFORMATION AND I THINK THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN A LITTLE WHILE. I KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW IT'S COMPLEX ISSUE IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND FINANCING. WHAT DO YOU -- I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU IN A PERFECT WORLD. BUT WHAT WE DO. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS REARRANGING THE CHAIRS ON THE TITANIC. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS THING'S GOING DOWN A MEDICAL SO SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN A PERFECT WORLD. OF WHAT WOULD WE DO AND NO OTHER PLACES HAVE TALKED ABOUT OF THE STATES HAVE TALKED ABOUT. OF PAYING IT FORWARD IN TERMS OF FREE SPEECH EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN PAY FOR IT AFTER THEY GRADUATED AND SO THAT CREATES A DIFFERENT STREAM OF RESOURCES. BRING WHAT WOULD WE DO I YOU KNOW I'M FROM THE WEALTH FROM THE ORIGINAL UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CALLED THE ORIGINAL THAT LESS OF A LONG TIME WE PAID NO TUITION. WILL ONLY PAID FEES EIGHTY DOLLARS A SEMESTER AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHEN I START TEACHING PAID. THIRTY SEVEN FIFTY A SEMESTER THEY PAID FEES IT NEVER PAID FOR THE PROFESSORS IN THE EDUCATION SO WHAT DOES NOT AS YOU CAN SEE LOOKING AT THE CHART AND HOW IT'S CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- IN A REAL WORLD HOW DO WE GET BACK TO THAT -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHEN WE TALK UP HERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW. AND NOT THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW. AND WE OTHER SO SEEM TO BE. SOME OF THE STATES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW I AM SURE LIKE MOST FOLKS USE HER TO MY TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW WE DO TAXES IN CALIFORNIA IS ALL WRONG. AND DATA AND SO AS A RESULT IN THE OLD WAY WE HIT SEEM TO BE MUCH MORE STABLE AS FUNDING. BUT THAT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE TO BITE OFF WITH THE PUBLIC. AND YET AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY HAD SOME ASSURANCE THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME DRAMATIC CHANGES. LIKE FREE EDUCATION LIKE WE USED TO HAVE. IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO THROW THAT INTO THE CONVERSATION SO. AS AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA NIGHT OF THE DAY BUT TOMORROW. IT'S WHERE WE ALMOST BECOME -- BILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEPRESSION PROVEN SOMEWHERE RECESSION PROOF IN SOME WAY OF BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE FUND THINGS AND HOW WE OPERATE. KNOW WHAT DO YOU FOLKS CMU YOU THE NUMBERS CRUNCHERS IN THE FINANCIERS AND ALL THOSE FOLKS. IN A REAL WORLD AND AND I SHOULD SAY IT WILL WORK IS WHEN THAT NOW BUT IN AN IDEAL WORLD WHAT WOULD WE DO. I KNOW WE CAN SAY WE COULD STABILIZE FUNNY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS -- IN A WORLD IT'S UNSTABLE OKAY SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WE WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT AND AND AND HOW DO WE GET THERE. WILL YOU IDENTIFY OF A FEW PROBLEMS -- VOLATILITY OF REVENUES PRIORITIES DO YOU HAVE YOU KNOW FREE COLLEGE FOR ALL OR DO YOU EXPECT SOME INDIVIDUALS TO PAY FOR THEIR COST OF EDUCATION. THOMAS OTHERS ARE THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT IN A POLICY OCCASIONS THERE -- I I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO POINT OUT THAT. YOU NO YOU DON'T LIVE IN AN IDEAL WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE. ALL THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NECESSARILY WANT TO WORK WITH AND YOU CANNOT PERFECTLY PREDICT WHATTHE BUDGET IS GOING TO BE. FIVE YEARS OUT AND IN SOME CASES IN OUR OFFICE. IN WE WE DO FORECAST EVERY YEAR OFTHE BUDGET -- AND EVEN PREDICTING WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. SO YOU DO HAVE TO YOU TO FACE THAT REALITY IN A WE RECOMMEND STARTING A RESERVE EVERY YEAR IN THE BUDGET. ABOUT THE EXACT LEVEL OF RESERVE YOU SHOULD SET YOU KNOW IS OPEN TO DEBATE AND IT'S GONNA INVOLVE YOUR PRIORITIES IN THAT YEAR. BOB YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE LEGISLATURE'S DONE THIS IN THE PAST IT DID YOU KNOW KEEP ONGOING PRIORITIES DOWN AND AND WE COMMIT SOME FUNDING TO ONE TIME PRIORITIES WHEN TIMES ARE REALLY GOD KNOWS HER. TWO WAYS THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE THAT. ON BUT AGAIN YOU THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH THEBUDGET THERE YOU REYES ARE A KIND OF PRE NO QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU BUDGET FOR SOMETHING ABOUT HOW DO YOU HAVE A LONG TERM VISION WHEN IT'S HARD TO PROJECT PREDICT THE FUTURE? AND SOMETHING THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH IN THE YOU KNOW THE OFFICE AS WE TRY TO ADVISE YOU ON THESE ISSUES BUT I THINK AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SETTING ASIDE FUNDING EVERY YEAR IN THE BUDGET. THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN TIMES ARE REALLY GOOD THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE ONE TIME YOU KNOW PRIORITIES AND LIABILITIES IN THE STATE AND PAYING THOSE DOWN. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SOME PRACTICES THAT YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL. AND THEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES IN WHICH WOULD LIKE TO FUND IF YOU OF YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD THE SHARE OF COSTS BE SHOULD IT BE FREE EDUCATION FOR ALL SHOULD SOME STUDENTS BE EXPECTED THEIR SHARE THE COST OF THEIR EDUCATION. THAT'S GONNA FALL MORE ON WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES THINK THE STATE'S ROLE ISM AND FUNDING HIGHER EDUCATION THAT YOU KNOW COULD DIFFER DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I FIND -- A I GUESS IT'S LIKE. SOME KIND OF A MAGIC FINANCING THE WHATEVER IT IS. FOR US THAT WE ARE THAT WE HAVE MONEY. THAT WE PUT INTO FINANCIAL A OKAY AND THEN TURN AROUND AND DO SOME OTHER THINGS TOO SO THAT IN THE END. THOSE OF PAYING. FOR PAYING SOME FEES I PAYING IN FOR THE FINANCIAL AID I ASSUME OF OTHERS AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S ALL THIS MONEY THIS FLOAT AROUND HERE IT EVEN IN OUR FINANCIAL AID. AREA OF THAT IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT AT ALL. AND PUT IT ALL BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. RATHER THAN GIVING OUT SOME FINANCE A TO A FEW. A BUT THE P. WOULD PROBABLY SEE IT MORE AS A FREE EDUCATION. NO ONE OF THE THINGS IT SEEMS WHEN I'M TALKING TO PEOPLE AND I'M SAYING WELL. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS ALMOST FREE WE DON'T YOU KNOW BECAUSE EVERYBODY THE GET A BOB GRANT OR SALT WATER SOME THAT PAYS FOR EVERYTHING OR YOU GO TO THE I KNOW WE HAVE THE DREAM GROUP NOW IT'S HE SEES YOU. AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE STUFF THAT AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT BECOMES VERY CONFUSING WITH THIS CHART WHERE. YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE PAYING THIS BUT IN REALITY WE PAID IT. AND SO AND IT ALL GETS TWISTED AROUND AND I'M SO SO. HOW MUCH DO PEOPLE REALLY PAY TO GO TO SCHOOL? OKAY AND DO THAT IF YOU KNOW HOW MUCH DID DID IT REALLY COST THE STUDENTS. ALL OF US GIVING BACK TO THEM WHAT WE CHARGE THEM. ILL A SO I'M JUST GONNA. HE'LL FIGURE OUT A SIMPLE WAY TO DO THIS. AS AS WELL AS MIGHT INSPIRE US TO DO MORE. OF BECAUSE WE HEAR ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS TUITION STUDENTS ARE PAYING AND IT'S THERE BUT THEN WE HEAR ABOUT THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL A AND ANYTIME WE INCREASE FEES WILL INCREASE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO. WHO IS REALLY PAN TO GO TO SCHOOL? I MEAN THAT I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION AND WE STRIP OPET WEEK IF WE GAVE NO FINANCIAL AID AT ALL. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN IN TERMS THAT POT OF MONEY THAT'S IN FINANCIAL AID? THAT NOW GOES INTO THE SYSTEM ITSELF TO FUND STUDENTS. WHAT WILL WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? IF ANYBODY ASK THEMSELVES THAT HAVE YOU GUYS AS A QUESTION WOULD INTO ANY FINANCIAL AID PUT ALL THE MONEY THAT WE GIVE FINANCE WAY BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. WHAT WE'VE BEEN HAVE TO CHARGE STUDENTS TO GO TO SCHOOL? YOU KNOW I HAD I DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE ON THAT ON IN YOUR FINANCIALLY PANEL -- WE DO HAVE A HANDOUT WERE REDESCRIBED -- WHEN YOU FACTOR IN [inaudible] OF THE VERY IT NOT ONLY OF THE STATE SUBSIDY BUT ALSO STATE FUNDING FOR FINANCIAL AID AND KNOCKING OUT. THE TUITION DISCOUNTS THAT STUDENTS GET RIGHT HOW MUCH IT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE ACTUALLY PAYING UNITS IT'S LESS THAN I THINK PEOPLE REALIZE SOMETIMES IT'S ON OF THE NUMBERS AND FROM ME BUT IT'S LIKE 5% OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THAT'S MAYBE ROUND 17230% AT UC AND CSU AT THE ACTUAL. NUMBERS ARE IN YOUR HAND OUT SO I WOULD DEFER TO THE BUT ON I SAY WE HAVE DONE THAT EXERCISE IN TERMS OF IF WE WOULDA. IF WE WERE TO PUT FINANCIAL AID ALL OF THEM FUNDING BACK IS A DIRECT SUBSIDY FOR THOSE IT OF SEGMENTS. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WOULD STUDENT CHARGES BE ADJUSTED TO AYE AYE THAT I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME BUT THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S A CALCULATION MAYBE YOU COULD DO IF. YOU KNOW THINKING FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT THAT ESTIMATE FROM ME BUT I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE WHO QUESTIONS HOUSE AT BECAUSE I WAS HE ABOUT THE FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE I HEREBY WILL BE CHARGED HERE BY THE FINANCIAL AID. HERE BUT SOMETHING ELSE AND SOMETHING ELSE AND SO I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF MOST STUDENTS REALLY PAYING. AND AND IS IT REASONABLE TO SAY THAT WE ARE CHARGING TUITION. AND THEN PAYING FOR AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW -- SO THAT. WE'RE GIVING THE STUDENTS WHAT WE CHARGING AN EXACT AND A REALIZATION OF THAT UNTIL OF SOMEONE MENTION WELL THOUGH. FINANCIAL VIA TUITIONS WILL INCREASE BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE GOT A CUP IN FINANCE RIGHT. SOME SAM WILL WHY WOULD WE INCREASE THE TUITION IF YOU ARE GOING TO TURN AROUND AND PUT IT FINANCIAL AID THIS GOT PAPER I MEAN. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS -- AND THE LAST POINT THAT I WAS MAKING ABOUT TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION AND BEING ABLE. TO GET PRECISELY THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE POSING IN IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND WE THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN METRICS. THAT ARE NOT. EASILY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY'RE NOT UNDERSTOOD ACROSS SYSTEMS SO HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY BRING SOME TRANSPARENCY AND SOME -- UNIFORMITY TO THE WAY IN WHICH WE MEASURE THE SING SO NUMBER ONE I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE THE FACTORS ARE -- LATE. AND THEN ASKING BOLD QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN FACT IF WE WERE TO GIVE THE FINANCIAL THEY GIVE THAT MONEY BACK TO THE SYSTEM WHAT DOES THAT DO TO TUITION. I MEAN OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THE TUITION INCREASES WOULD BE AND THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THAT BUT THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE KINDS OF ANSWERS THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE AUSTIN AND ANSWERED AND THE NEXT. PANEL OF COURSE IS GOING. TO PICK THIS UP BEEN THOSE OF THE EXPERTS. THAT OF COURSE FINANCIALLY DOESN'T COVER TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WHICH IS THE OTHER THING THAT WE NEED TO BE. FRONT VERY THOUGHTFUL OF BUT I LOVE MY THING IS THAT IF IF WE GET AWAY FINANCE WAITING GAVE THE MONEY TO THE INSTITUTIONS. THE FEES WOULD DECREASE NOT INCREASE BECAUSE THAT MONEY WOULD GO TO BASICALLY DO WHAT IT'S DOING NOT ME. IT YOU GIVING THAT MONEY TO THE STUDENTS TO GIVE TO THE UNIVERSITIES OR WHOMEVER WHATEVER THIS IS AND SO THAT MONEY THEN IT'S LIKE. WE GAVE OUR MONEY THEY TURN ON GAVE IT BACK TO THE INSTITUTION THAT WE COULD HAVE GIVEN TO DIRECTLY. TO EDUCATE KIDS SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S I WAS A FAKE NEWS A FAKE INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS TO POLITICAL BUT HAVE -- BUT IT'S BUT IT'S IT'S NOT AS CLEAR AS I IS IT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M NOT SURE OF IS THAT THE ACTIVE AS IT SHOULD BE. A AND IT DOESN'T REALLY GIVE US A FULL SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF EDUCATING KIDS HOW MUCH MONEY WERE ACTUALLY PUTTING INTO THOSE SYSTEMS. THAT -- AND THAT MONEY WOULD BE USED TO RUN THE SYSTEM SO THAT THAT THEY COULD NOT ALL OF A SUDDEN INCREASE TUITION. UP BECAUSE IF THEY WANT INCREASE TUITION WHEN MAY INCREASE TUITION WE PAY FOR IT ANYWAY. OKAY SO AS A RESULT -- YOU KNOW THE MONEY IS STILL THE IT'S ALL THE SAME MONEY ROAMING AROUND IN THE SAME POT. OTHER MAYBE OTHER RESOURCES ARE BETTER AT PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON THAT WE FIND IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE THE CAMPUSES THAT WE HAVE THIS ISSUE THE UC'S AND OTHERS. YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE GIVEN THE BOB GRANT INSTEAD OF GIVING THE BOB GRANT TO PAY FOR THE SO CALLED TUITION THAT STUDENTS HAVE. FORGIVEN STRUGGLING TO DIRECTLY TO THE INSTITUTIONS HERE'S THE MONEY TO RUN THE INSTITUTION AND ALL. AND THEN THAT MAY GIVE US A PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO CLOSE THE GAP TO HAVE FREE TUITION COMPLETELY. I IN SOME PLACES IT MAY BE CLOSE IN SOME COMMITTEE COLLEGES A C. ISSUE SO I STILL HAVE SOME GAPS THAT OF THE YEAR. THAT ARE MADE UP BY FEDERAL GRANTS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON BUT BUT IT JUST SEEMS STRANGE TO ME THAT WE ARE AN INSTITUTION THAT WE HAVE THESE UNIVERSITIES. AND THAT WE HAVE THE SPECIES WE CHARGE THEM AND THEN WE PAY FOR THOSE FEES UP WITH FINANCIAL AID A CLEARLY SOME STUDENTS DON'T QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND THAT MAY BE A VARIABLE IN DETERMINING WHAT STUDENTS PAY IF WE PAY FOR EVERYTHING WHAT STUDENTS WHICH STUDENTS WHO WOULD WEBSITE INCOME HAVE TO PAY ADDITIONAL FEES OR SOMETHING. THAT MIGHT BE THERE BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT'S MONEY THAT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE. YOU KNOW AND AND AS A RESULT I'M NOT SURE WITH THAT AS EFFECTIVE AS WE COULD BE IN PLANNING THAT MONEY. BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS WE THINK WE SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO FINANCE THE SYSTEM. AND I I DID WANT TO NOTE TWO THINGS -- THAT I WON IT BY UNDERSTOOD WHATEVER QUESTIONS WAS. NOW AFTER FINANCIAL AID WHAT IT ACTUALLY COST UNITS TO GO TO COLLEGE IN THERE ARE ESTIMATES OF THAT AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A TABLE IN THE NEXT PANEL THAT THAT SHOWS COST PER STUDENT SO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY REVIEW THAT TABLE THAT MIGHT. GET AT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE IN THAT AT GUESS THAT DEALS WITH BOOKS MAYBE I'M LEFT FEES OCCASIONALLY RIGHT BUT BUT WE PROBABLY PAY LAB FEES IF WE PUT THE MONEY IN IT. A WE MAY HAVE TO PAY ME AT THE PAPER BOOKS AND OF COURSE IF THEY DON'T LIVE ON CAMPUS THAT HAVE TO PAY FOR LODGING. OKAY I ASSUME SO OF THAT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT TO ME WE NEED CELLS IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE CURRENTLY FINANCING IT RATHER THAN. JUST FIGURED WE NEED TO FIND SOME MORE REVENUE SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH WOULD PROBABLY DO BUT ALSO YOU KNOW HAVING A A SPECIAL FUND FOR THE RAINY DAY. BECAUSE WILL PROBABLY NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE RAINY DAY FUND TO ACTUALLY. HAVE A REAL RAIN ON US A AND SO THAT BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE BUT BUT I I'M I'M JUST I'M I'M I'M ALWAYS IN ALL OF THE FINANCIAL A PIECE BECAUSE AND THOSE SYSTEMS THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE ALIVE ONE HAND GIVEN TO THE EXPAND. AND IT ENDS UP WITH A THIRD HAND WHICH IS WHAT WE WANTED TO GO IN FIRST PLACE. AND ALL AND I'M JUST THINKING WHY DID WE DO ALL THAT. YOU KNOW JUST TO GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO THE INSTITUTIONS IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. YOU KNOW HOUSING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HERE THAT THAT'S THERE BUT YOU KNOW IS SELLING EUROPE WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE FREE TUITION. JUST DON'T CHARGING TUITION GIVE MONEY TO THE INSTITUTIONS WHERE THEY'RE GOING RATHER THAN GIVE IT TO THEM SO THEY COULD PAY THEIR DREAM ACT FUNNY OR WHATEVER IT IS AND COME BACK AROUND IN THE DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A TREMENDOUS WASTE OF ENERGY BUT ALSO NOT VERY CLEAR TO US. WITH HOW MUCH WE ARE ACTUALLY SUPPORTING WELL THANK YOU DR WEBER FOR DOING A GREAT JOB OF CLEANING UP OUR NEXT PANEL -- AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THIS PANEL VERY MUCH FOR FOR COMING IN CHATTING WITH US TODAY AND ALL THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED THANK YOU. OUR NEXT PANEL WILL BE ON FINANCING STUDENT AID IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE WITH JENNIFER KUHN -- DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FOLLOWED BY THE PEAK THEIR CORTEZ ON CALL ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA'S TO NAY COMMISSION. AND ROBERT CHARMIN SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION THANKS ALSO MUCH. THANK YOU JENNIFER CAN ALLEGE ANALYST'S OFFICE I YOU SHOULD HAVE AUTHOR HAND DOWN FOR YOU FINANCIALLY MAJOR BUDGET TRENDS I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF FUNDING FOR FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. I DO THINK IT I MIGHT HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS THAT YOU JUST TIED SO STARTING HERE ON PAGE. ONE IT LOOKS OUT MAJOR FINANCIALLY DEVELOPMENTS. THE STATE FIRST PROVIDED SUBSIDIES DIRECTLY TO THE INSTITUTION INSTITUTIONS SO IT'S DONE THIS FOR DECADES. WHEN THE STATE PROVIDES FUNDING DIRECTLY TO EACH OF THE STATEMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THOSE TUITION FOR EVERYONE AYE WHETHER THEY HAVE FINANCIAL NEED DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED? SO WHEN YOU LOOK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE STATE SUBSIDIES TO THE STATE TO THE EACH OF THE SEGMENTS WAS COVERING 95% OF THE EDUCATION COSTS AT THE COLLEGES. 68% THAT CS YOU AND 62% AT UC'S SO THE STATE SUBSIDIES WERE COVERING UP A PREPONDERANCE OF COST AT AT SEVERAL OF THE SEGMENTS. IN THE MID FIFTIES THE STATE PROVIDED ITS FIRST TARGETED FINANCIALLY PROGRAM SO RATHER THAN GIVING MONEY TO THE SEGMENTS THAT GAVE IT DIRECTLY TO FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS. THE VERY FIRST STATE FUNDED PROGRAM FOCUSED ON TUITION ASSISTANCE THAT FOCUSED ON HIGH COST INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOT INVOLVED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES CREATING THEIR OWN GRANT AND LOAN PROGRAMS AND THOSE PROGRAMS CREATED IN THE SIXTIES ARE THE PRECURSORS OF WHAT WE HAVE TODAY SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TODAY HAS A LARGE PROGRAM PROGRAM. AND ALSO HAS LARGE STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS. IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AT THAT POINT THE STATE HAD A PATCHWORK OF STATE FUNDED PROGRAM SO IT REPLACE THOSE PROGRAMS WITH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. AND THE STRUCTURE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS LARGELY THE SAME AS IT DOES TODAY. SO BACK IN THE LATE SEVENTIES THE STATE A PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROVIDE TUITION ASSISTANCE FOR SORT OF MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS. CAL GRANT BE WOULD PROVIDE BOTH TUITION ASSISTANCE AND SOME LIVING COVERAGE BUT IT WOULD DO IT FOR THE FINANCIALLY NEEDY OUR STUDENTS THE LOWER INCOME STUDENTS. AND THEN THE CAL GRANT SEE WOULD BE A SPECIALIZED PROGRAM THAT WOULD HELP THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING INTO SHORT TERM HER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CSU IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES INTRODUCED THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAMS. I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT AT THIS TIME INSTITUTIONAL I'M EDUCATION FEES ARE BEING INSTITUTED INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAMS THAT THE COLLEGE AT THE COMMUNICATIVE ARE INTENDED TO COVER. THOSE ON EDUCATION FEES. SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME OVER TIME THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM TRADITIONALLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEE WAIVER PROGRAM THE CS YOU'VE INSTITUTIONALLY PROGRAM BECAME KNOWN AS THE STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT PROGRAM. YOU SEE HAD ALREADY HAD AN INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAM IN PLACE THAN IT HAD COVERED TUITION AS WELL AS LIVING COST TRADITIONALLY THAT'S BEEN CALLED THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT A PROGRAM. SO YOU TURN TO PAGE TO IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS A FEW OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE DECADE SO THE STATE. MADE PROGRAMS AN ENTITLEMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SO THOSE STUDENTS PARTICULARLY WHO ARE COMING STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. AND ARE WERE ONLY SPENDING A FEW YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN WE'RE COMPLETING OUR TRANSFER COLLEGE LOWER DIVISION COURSES THAT COMMUNICATIVE IN JUST A FEW YEARS TIME. THOSE WHO ARE TO RETIREMENT THAT FACT OF LEON AT PRETTY STREAMLINED PATH TOWARD THE UNIVERSITY IS WOULD BE ENTITLED FOR AID. AND THEN THOSE STUDENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM TYPICALLY THEY WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE OR BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THEY HAD OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN THE STATEMENT SOME REFINEMENTS AND TWO THOUSAND AND ONE TO THAT PROGRAM SEE PROGRAM JUST REFINING AT TRYING TO TARGET TO DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS TO CERTAIN HIGH WORKFORCE DEMAND AREAS. FROM TWO THOUSAND ONE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE STATE TOOK OF WRITER OPTIONS TO GIVE SOME AID OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS SO OVER THAT COURSE OF TIME IT PROVIDE IT ALLOWS YOU STUDENTS TO QUALIFY FOR RESIDENT TUITION CHARGES I EACH OF THE SEGMENTS. THEN AND ALLOW THEM TO QUALIFY FOR STATE FUNDED AID AND THEN AND ALLOW THEM TO GET STATE FUNDED LOANS. DURING THE RECESSION YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT STATE FUNDING DROPPING INTUITION CHARGES INCREASING AND AT THIS TIME THERE WAS INCREASING CONCERN WITH MODELING. INCOME STUDENTS EVEN THOSE WHO ONE AND HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN DEFINED AS FINANCIALLY NEEDY AND SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE STATE PUTS IN PLACE THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. TODAY THAT PROGRAMS FULLY IMPLEMENTED IT COVERS 40% OF THE TUITION CHARGE FOR MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. AND THEN EVEN MORE RECENTLY THE NOT JUST THE LAST FEW BUDGET CYCLES THE STATE HAS CREATED SOME PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE LIVING ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO DO QUALIFY FOR THE CAL GRANT BE PROGRAM. BUT WHO QUALIFY TYPICALLY FOR A RATHER MODEST LIVING ADJUSTMENT THIS IS TO PROVIDE THEM A MORE GENEROUS LIVING GRANT IF THEY GO FULL TIME. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY TAKE FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS TODAY THEY QUALIFY FOR FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDS ABOVE THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESSED THE WORD ABOUT THE PROGRAM TO FADE OUT APPLY FOR IT. PAGE THREE AND FOUR THEN FOCUS ON MORE DEEPLY WHAT'S HAPPENED TO TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID OVER THE YEARS. SO IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS GOING WAY BACK YOU SEE HAD THINGS CALLED FEES IT WASN'T UNTIL THE NINETEEN SEVENTY IS WHERE THEY CREATED AN EDUCATION FEET UP OVER THE DECADES OF VAULT INTO THE TUITION CHART WE KNOW OF TODAY. CSU ALSO HAD HISTORY OF COURSE FEES MATERIAL IN SERVICE FEES BUT THEY DON'T CREATE THE THOSE STATE UNIVERSITY FEE UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE EIGHTY TWO THE SAUCER HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME TO BECOME THE TUITION FEE. THE ISSUE CREATED ITS M. ENROLLMENT FEE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND ALL OF THESE CASES THAT EDUCATION FEE HAS EBBED AND FLOWED WITH THE ECONOMIC CYCLE INCREASING AS YOU'VE HEARD LOTS ABOUT DURING RECESSIONS. THIS IS TIMES WHEN THE STATE FUNDS FUNDING US DROPPING IT'S ALSO THE TIME WHERE FAMILY WAGES TEND TO BE STAGNATING AND UNEMPLOYMENT TIMES TO BE INCREASING. JUSTIN CONTRAST DURING RECOVERIES STATE FUNDING IS INCREASING SO FEES ARE A HALT FLAT THIS IS ALSO THE TIME WHEN FAMILY INCOMES TEND TO BE INCREASING UNEMPLOYMENT DROPPING. WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE PERIOD THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD STRETCHING FROM NINETEEN NINETY THROUGH TWENTY FIFTEEN AND INFLATION ADJUSTED DOLLARS YOU SEE THAT THE FEE AT UC NC ISSUES INCREASE FIFTEEN TIMES? AND AT THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES THIRTY FOLD SERVE OBVIOUSLY VERY STEEP INCREASE AS DESPITE THOSE INCREASES COMMUNITY COLLEGE FEES TODAY ARE STILL THE LOWEST IN THE NATION. AS CSU IS LOW RELATIVE TO ITS AND INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BY CONTRAST UC'S TUITION CHARGES A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN ITS COMPARABLE INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HAVE YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR IT GIVES YOU COMPARABLE INFORMATION ON AND FINANCIAL AID FOR UNDERGRADUATES FOR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. I TUITION I I'M SORRY SPENDING ON CAL GRANTS GOES UP AS TUITION INCREASES TO YOU CAN SEE THOSE TRENDS. YOU CAN SEE IN INFLATION ADJUSTED TERMS FINANCIAL AID SPENDINGS INCREASED FIVE FOLD OVER THE PERIOD SO BY TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE THAN EIGHT BILLION A SPENT ANNUALLY ON AID. FOR UNDERGRADUATES. ALTHOUGH THE NEXT PAGE GETS OUT SOME OF THE CONVERSATION YOU WERE HAVING EARLIER WITHIN THAT PRICE. AND SO FINANCIAL AID APPEARS TO BE WORKING GENERALLY AS AN TIME DEAD WHERE LOWER INCOME STUDENTS ARE FACING LOWER NET PRICE. SO WHAT NOT PRICES A MEASURE OF HIS LOOKING NOT FROM A STUDENT'S PERSPECTIVE THERE COST OF ATTENDANCE SO NOT FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM THE STUDENT'S TUITION LEVINE HOW MUCH DOES IT COST IS IT UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT'S ABSTRACTS ALL OF THEIR GIFT DATED AND LOOKS AT HOW MUCH THEN IS THE PRICE THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY. AND I'M THE GRAPHIC AT THE TOP SHOWS YOU JUST THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION ACROSS STATES OF THE CAMPUSES SO YOU CAN SEE THAT STUDENTS THAT THE COLLEGES. ARE LOWER INCOME THAN NOT THE UNIVERSITY IS 67% OF COMMUNICATIVE STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE COME FROM FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR. FOR THOSE STUDENTS I'M AND NOT INCOME RANGE AT THE COLLEGES THEIR PAIN I'M EITHER OUT OF POCKET OR THROUGH SOME SORT OF BORROWING OR WORK EARNINGS FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE DOLLARS THESE ARE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN NUMBERS. BUT YOU CAN SEE ACROSS ALL OF THE SEGMENTS THAT AS FAMILY INCOME GOES UP THAT NIGHT PRICE GOES THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU PRESUMABLY WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT AS FAMILIES. INCOMES IMPROVE -- THE AMOUNT THAT THEY PAY OUT OF POCKET INCREASES BUT THAT THE FINANCIALLY NEEDY OF STUDENTS ARE PAINT THE LEAST THIS IS A TREND YOU TO SEE AGAIN ACROSS ALL OF THE SEGMENTS. THE REASON NOT NOT PRICE IS AS LOW AS THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA IS BECAUSE OF STAMPS SUBSTANTIAL SHARE OF UNDERGRADUATES TO GET THEIR FEES COVERED SO 58% OF UNDERGRADUATES AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALMOST TWO THREE TWO THIRDS OF THE UNIVERSITIES. AND THIS IS THE CONVERSATION AGAIN -- JUST SEN MAY BE A ADDRESS ONE OF THE ISSUES ITEM IF YOU WERE IF TO FOR EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT YOU SEE IN RIGHT NOW THEY'RE CHARGED AT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IF YOU WERE TO SAY HEY LET'S CUT IT IN HALF TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE ISSUE THERE OBVIOUSLY AS YOUR NOW CHARGING EVERYBODY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS SOME WHO MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT SO THAT MIGHT BE THE THING THAT PROHIBITS THEM FROM GOING TO COLLEGE. AND THEN THE FAMILIES WHO WOULD GO TO COLLEGE REGARDLESS MIGHT EVEN BE WILLING TO PAY TWICE AS MUCH AS WE NOW CHARGE THEM THAT MONEY WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE TAKEN ON THE SYSTEM. BUT IF YOU TURN TO THE LAST PAGE CHAIR IS JUST ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT FOR DECADES SOME OF THEM ARE EMERGING SALIENT ISSUES. THAT KEY AT ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT ALREADY HAS JUST HOW MUCH TO PUT DIRECTLY INTO THE SEGMENTS VERSUS HOW MUCH TO TARGET TO FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS. ANOTHER PERENNIAL ISSUE IS ONCE YOU'VE DETERMINED YOUR POT OF FINANCIAL AID FUNDING HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE NOT AMONG FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS LAST HOW MUCH ATTENTION DO YOU DEDICATE SET A TIME OUT OF COLLEGE INCOME AND ASSETS ACADEMIC CRITERIA. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGING SOME OF THOSE CRITERIA IN AN EFFORT TO SIMPLIFY AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS. YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT LATER ON THE PANEL TODAY. THE THIRD ISSUE WHICH IS INCREASING LEAD A HIGH PROFILE HAS TO DO WITH HOW TO PROVIDE SO THE STATE HAS A TRADITION OF PROVIDING SOME LIVING AID FOR THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS BUT MORE RECENTLY AS TRYING TO EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF LIVING COVERAGE THAT IT PROVIDES. BUT IT'S A LOT OF ISSUES ARE EMERGING AS IT CONSIDERS THAT'S HOW MANY YEARS IS IT OKAY IF A STUDENT IS IN COLLEGE FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS WITH THE STATE STILL COVER LIVING COSTS. WHAT WOULD BE THE EXPECTATIONS ON STUDENTS WORKER IN IN SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT STUDENTS CAN WORK UP TO TWENTY HOURS WITHOUT NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ON THEIR EDUCATION WHAT THE STATE EXPECT THEM TO WORK A MINIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS? SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT AS LONG AS STUDENTS GRADUATE THEY TEND TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR THAT LEVELS THE PROBLEM BECOMES WHEN STUDENTS GET THREE YEARS INTO A PROGRAM AND THEN DON'T COMPLETE AND DON'T HAVE EASY ACCESS. TO MANAGE THEIR DOT OVER TIME. THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF LIVING COSTS SHOULD THERE BE EXPECTATIONS THAT STUDENTS THAT COME LIVE AT HOME DO SO FOR A YEAR OR THAT STUDENTS PICK RELATIVELY AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. MANY ISSUES HAVE BEEN A MERGING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COVER LIVING COSTS IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. AND FINALLY YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW COMPLEX THE SYSTEM HAS GOTTEN FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM STUDENTS PERSPECTIVES. SO TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THE SYSTEM WHILE STILL TAKING INDIVIDUAL STUDENT NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT SO WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS TO HAVE A RESPONSIVE SYSTEM THAT STILL MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT SOME VERY REASONABLE OPTIONS. THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LATER ON THE PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE. THANK AFTERNOON LOOKING BACK THAT'S LIKE ALLOW BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION THE PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU. FOR INVITING ME TO THIS OP PANEL IN THIS HEARING -- FIRST BALL I INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED. TO YOU NAY COMMISSION THAT ADMINISTERS THAT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND STATE FINANCIAL AID AND TODAY BECAUSE JENNIFER HAVE GONE OVER SOME OF THE CURRENT PROGRAMS IN A WAY THE SHOULDN'T NAME THEM WHICH IS FINE -- BUT WORK I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE SHORTCOMINGS AND THEN WHAT WE ENVISIONED SO I'VE CUT. I CAN'T AT LEAST MY TESTIMONY AT LEAST BY ONE THIRD OR SO WAS I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL -- VERSO WE HAVE A VERY GENEROUS -- FINANCIALLY THAT -- YOU KNOW IN IT PROGRAM WHICH TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT PROVIDES A AWARDS TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS AND OF COURSE THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE STUDENT HAS CHANGED OUR LAST FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS SO WE HAVE. ALLOT MORE STUDENTS THAT ARE FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME -- THAT ALSO ARE -- OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR OF COURSE AND WE ARE ENCOURAGING ALL STUDENTS TO GO ON TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION SO THAT THE STUDENT TODAY LOOKS DIFFERENT WORKS MORE AND IT MIGHT EVEN BE OLDER AND AND MARK NONTRADITIONAL. WE ALSO -- HAVE THE PRESTIGE OF OFFERING CHOICES TO STUDENTS SO THEY CAN ATTEND THE UC AND CSU COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEY MEAN IT ATTEND A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT OR NONPROFIT A WASP ACCREDITED -- AND SO STUDENTS HAVE THAT CHOICE WHICH IS UNIQUE AS WELL -- IN OUR STATE. BUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ASSERTIVE. IT HAS TO DO WITH STUDENT DEBT. FOOD AND HOUSING IN SECURITY NOT TO MENTION STUDENT COMPLETION AND SO WE'RE HERE TODAY LIKELY FOR THAT. REASON ALONE IF FINANCIAL AID COVERED EVERYTHING EVERYONE WAS GRADUATING ON TIME WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS HEARING IT'S OVER HERE THAT SORT OF WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY EXAMINES SORT OF THE SYSTEM AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO MODERNIZE IT TO MEET THE STUDENT TODAY SO. SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE CURRENT FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM AND YOU SHOULD HAVE A ONE PAGER THAT TALKS ABOUT FUTURE FINANCIALLY. AND SO SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS POLICE WITH A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM AND IT'S OUR PROGRAM THAT REALLY TRIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS AND THAT -- ARE YOU KNOW -- TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OR OLDER WE ARE ABOUT 250-007-0050 AWARDS BUT WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IT WOULD COULD QUALIFY FOR THAT AWARD TO WE HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY. NOT BEING COVERED THAT COULD BE COVERED -- WITHOUT A WORD SO THAT'S REALLY ONLY ABOUT WE ONLY COVER ABOUT QUALIFY FOR THAT WORD EVEN THOUGH WE TALK ABOUT HOW GENEROUS WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL ENTITLEMENT TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT WOULDN'T GOING ALL THE NAMES. BUT WE ARE WE ARE PRETTY GENEROUS -- ABOUT THOSE AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE THE BE IT CAL GRANT BE ACCESS WORD IN THIS IS PRIMARILY THE THE A FINANCIAL AID THAT PROVIDES FOR LIVING EXPENSES. IT WE PROVIDE ABOUT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS FOR A FULL TIME STUDENT -- AND OF COURSE WE MAKE IT A GUARANTEE IF THE COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR GOING DOING A TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT BUT OF COURSE THOSE STUDENTS ON THE COMPETITIVE LIST. ONLY GET THAT ABOUT ONLY 8% OF THOSE ACTUALLY ARE AWARDED THAT NOW IF THAT WOULD THAT AMOUNT WOULD HAVE KEPT. KEPT UP WITH THE PRICE OF INFLATION IT WOULD BE WORTH SIX THOUSAND TODAY. SO SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO SHOULD REALLY BE WORTH SIX THOUSAND THAT COST QUITE A BIT OF MONEY TO TO FUND THAT AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. SO IN ADDITION -- WE ALSO WE SAW ONE OF OUR PROPOSALS AS PART OF AND I KNOW THAT -- ROBERT HARDMAN HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT XIN -- AND THE REPORT THAT WE COMMISSION THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE LED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY -- THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN THE BE ACCESS AWARD WHICH WOULD HELP FUND SOME OF THAT TUITION AND LIVING EXPENSES THAT -- STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING FROM. SO THERE'S ALSO A GAP -- LET ME THEY WITH THE GAP IS. SO WE'VE AYE AYE I THINK WE AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED OVER THE YEARS WE'VE ATTACK TRY. TO HELP AND AND INCENTIVIZE SORT OF THE CAL GRANT AND SO FOR STUDENTS OF FAMILIES A FOR THAT MAKE UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND YOU CAN HAVE A TWO POINT OH GPA AND GET A CAL GRANT WHICH MEASURE TUITION AND FEES. NOW FOR STUDENTS THAT -- A FAMILY FOR THE MAKES ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A THREE POINT NO. BUT ANY STUDENT IN BETWEEN THE TWO POINT OR THROUGH PUERTO THAT LET'S SAY IS IN THE SIXTY THOUSAND RANGE GETS NOTHING. NOTHING FROM THE STATE RIGHT AND SO THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY A GAP IN A NEED TO SORT OF FILL THAT GAP -- AND SO -- AND IT WAS IT WASN'T INCLUDED TO HELP INCENTIVIZE OF COURSE -- INTO TO TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO GET -- INCLUDE GET HIGHER GPA SO CONSIDER THIS FOR IT FOR A FAMILY FOR THE EARNED SIXTY THOUSAND HALF OF WHAT ECONOMISTS SAY HOUSEHOLD NEEDS TO EARN TO AFFORD AN APARTMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO OR SAN MATEO. THE STUDENT YOU KNOW COULD EARN BELOW THREE POINT NO AND WOULD GET NOTHING TO IT SO CLEARLY THERE IN THE NEED BUT THEY THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THAT UP OPPORTUNITY FIRST YEAR OF TUITION FOR CAL GRANT BE STUDENTS AND SO I KNOW IT'S GOING AND GETTING COMPLICATED HERE BUT PURSUES. SET DID EARNED THAT LIVING AND TUITION THAT THE LIVING EXPENSES PORTION THE BE ACCESS AWARD IN ADDITION TO THAT TUITION FEES FOR THEIR FIRST YEAR. THEY DON'T GET ANYTHING FROM THE STATE -- GOING TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE THEY GET IN THE SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR. UP BUT THEY DO GET THAT SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO THE FIRST YEAR FOR LIVING EXPENSES NOW. THE UC ISSUES YOU MAY -- PROVIDE THAT TUITION BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T MUCH OF THE PRIVATE POLLARD WHOM BUT OF THE STATE DOESN'T PROVIDED. AND SO THIS -- THAT WAS ESTABLISHED -- IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND THAT NEVER CHANGE BECAUSE THEY ASSUME THAT ALL CAL GRANT BEESTON'S WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO COMMUNICABLE IT. AND WORK GOING STRAIGHT INTO A FOUR YEAR SO THAT'S ANOTHER -- SORT OF IOWA STATE EASY FIX BUT COULD BE FIXED AND TO PROVIDE THE STUDENTS THAT FOR YOUR COVERAGE. SO THE FUTURE SO WHAT WHAT WE ENVISION. A SO WE ENVISION A SYSTEM THAT ADDRESSES THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE A BEYOND JUST TUITION AND FEES AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HERE TODAY. LETTING BECAUSE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING EXPENSES HAS OUTPACED THE RISING TUITION AND FEES COSTS. SO ONE OF THE THE COMMISSIONERS AND MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITIES AS FOR THAT STILL NEED COMMISSION IS TO REINSTATE THAT SEARS SURVEY WHICH IS THAT STUDENT EXPENSE AND RESOURCES SURVEY TO REALLY FIND OUT. HOW MUCH OUR STUDENTS PAYING FOR AND SO AT ALL FIVE SEGMENTS AND SO IT WAS SUSPENDED AND THAT TWO THOUSAND SIX SEVEN BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS AND WE'VE REINSTITUTED IT -- THIS LAST SPRING WE DID A PILOT AND WE DID A PILOT AT OVER FIFTY COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND ALL PROVIDE YOU SOME PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE WE ARE GOING TO DO THE LARGER ONE THIS NOVEMBER WITH ALL FIVE SEGMENTS BUT I CAN LET YOU KNOW NOW THAT THE PILOT SURVEY DID FIND HOUSING AND FOOD. OF WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN WHAT THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX WAS SUGGESTING SWITCH REALLY THING WE WOULD DO SINCE I WAS SIX OR SEVEN IT INCREASE IT BY CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND CLEARLY. THAT WASN'T KEEPING UP AND SO I CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT -- THAT WE WERE OFF. BUT WITH FOODS AND FOOD AND HOUSING FOR SHORE -- AND SO I WERE REALLY SCIENTISTS ARE REINSTITUTE OUT WE ALSO -- I MENTIONED EARLIER WE COMMISSIONED A REPORT AND A RUBBER SHARMAN GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY OF THE THROUGH THE CENTURY FOUNDATION. AND THE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT -- WE'RE SUPPORTING WHICH IS A VISION FOR FINANCIALLY THAT STREAMLINES IT MAKES IT A SINGLE STATE GRANT AID PROGRAM A IT MAKES OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE MANAGEABLE FOR LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS. BY REDUCING THE NEED TO RELY AND LOAN THAT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF AID TO STUDENTS WITH HIGHEST OVERALL NEED AND DOUBLING DOWN THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. AND THOUGH IT WOULD CLOSE UP SOME OF THOSE GAPS SO THE FIRST PHASE OF IT INCREASE THE BE ACCESS WORK LIVING EXPENSES THE SECOND PHASE FOR US. AND IN OREGON THE COMMISSIONERS HAVE SUPPORTED IS A THANKLESS CONSOLIDATED MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND MUSIC EASIER TO COMMUNICATE -- WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT A BNC TWO POINT A THREE POINT OPEN UP THE FIRST YEAR BUT IN THE SECOND YOU KNOW AND SO I WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO EASILY UNDERSTAND. AND THEN THE THIRD PART REALLY. IS -- AND THEN BRINGING IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. SMALLER BUT A FIRST THOUGHT SO WE EXPAND THE CAL GRANT AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR FIRE FIVE SITE HIGHER ITS EGGMAN TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE WHAT WITH THAT WOULD COST BUT THEN LESLIE REALLY IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A DESIRE BY IT DEFINITELY SOME OF THE SEGMENTS HIGHER ED SEGMENTS AS YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST RESTOCKING THE BACK LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER SAID ON THE TITANIC. DOESN'T REALLY BENEFIT COMMITTEE COSTUMES FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE THEY IT WE HAVE A TIERED SYSTEM. OF ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID. SO THE HIGH THE MORE PRESTIGE THAT INSTITUTION THE MORE FINANCIAL AID WE PROVIDE THE INSTITUTION AND THAT STUDENT AND SO GUESS WHO GETS LEFT OUT. THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS RIGHT THEY DON'T GET AS MUCH AID AND I KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAS DONE SO MUCH MORE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROMISES LAST. YEAR AT TO TO REALLY BOOST THAT AND AND A AN INCREASE THAT. BUT IN ADDITION I HAD MENTIONED CAL GRANT SEEN THOSE OUR STUDENTS SEEKING A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. WE UP UNTIL RECENTLY PROVIDED THEM LITERALLY FOR AN ENTIRE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS WITH UP TO TWO THOUSAND BUT IT'S A LESS THAN THE SEVEN SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO SO SOMEHOW THEY'RE EDUCATION IS VALUED LAUGHS. AS A HOW TO INCORPORATE THEM IN THIS OVERHAUL SO THE THIRD PHASE IS REALLY AN OVERHAUL AND PROVIDING A REGIONALIZED EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION. AND RETHINKING HOW WE ADMINISTER FINANCIALLY TOTALLY BESIDE JUST CONSOLIDATING IN MAKING EASIER TO UNDERSTAND REALLY. WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH REGARDS TO PROVIDING A TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE TO A STUDENT? SIMILAR SORT OF CANADA AS WITCHES HAY ALL STERN BRING IN THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND AFTER THAT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ALL STUDENTS WITH AN EXPECTED PATH. FAMILY CONTRIBUTION ACTS GET THIS AND YOU CAN TAKE IT WHERE YOU NEED TO GO WHEREVER IT'S A HIGH QUALITY FOR BUSCA ACCREDITED INSTITUTION AND SO. THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHAT. AND WE WILL HOPE TO HAVE ON THAT COMMITTEE DISCUSSION IN SEPTEMBER AND THEN BRING IT OF COURSE TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN HAPPEN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO SING THOSE RESULTS -- THEN MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND ROBERT CHAIRMAN I'M A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION A OF A PROGRESSIVE THINK TANK THAT THAT WORKS ON EDUCATION LABOR IN A VARIETY OF OTHER. OTHER ISSUES -- I AM A BORN AND RAISED CALIFORNIAN -- AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO TESTIFY TODAY -- WE DID A DEEP DIVE INTO -- CALIFORNIA IS A FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM DURING THE WINTER -- WHICH WAS IN RESPONSE TO A LEGISLATIVE REQUEST THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO IDENTIFY WAYS FOR IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA SUGGEST METHODS FOR STREAMLINING AND CONSOLIDATING PROGRAM. PROGRAMS -- FINDING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE NEED TO RELY ON STUDENT LOAN DEBTS WE CONFERRED WITH -- EVERYBODY WE COULD IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- THE STOOD NAY COMMISSION AND STAFF WERE VERY GENEROUS WITH THEIR TIME AND WITH THE OUR HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS TO THEM AND TO AND ASKING THEM TO LEAD US THROUGH EXCRUCIATING DETAIL OF EXACTLY HOW THINGS. OPERATE AND AND AND SHOW US WHAT WHAT DATA THEY HAVE WHAT THEY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE -- TO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT THAT TIME AND I'M AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TO PULL TOGETHER SOME EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TO TAKE TAKE A LOOK. AT CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL AID ARE GENERAL FINDINGS WERE -- IN IN SOME SENSE GOOD NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA IT COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT. LOW INCOME STUDENTS MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID EITHER THROUGH CAL GRANTS OR THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL AID OR SOME COMBINATION SO I'M WE WE SHOULD TAKE SOME PRIDE IN THAT -- AT THE SAME TIME WE DID FIND THAT MORE AID MORE GRANT AID IS NEEDED ESPECIALLY TO ADDRESS NON TUITION EXPENSES AND ESPECIALLY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE THE THE AID PROGRAMS ARE ARE -- JUST NOT NOT AVAIL I IN THE SEGMENTS WE ALSO FOUND A SERIOUS LACK OF COORDINATION AMONG THE VARIOUS PIECES OF THIS FINANCIAL AID PUZZLE THAT MAKES THINGS HARD FOR STUDENTS AND FOR ANYBODY IN. INVOLVED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM WHETHER THAT IS FOLKS AT K. TWELVE SCHOOLS WHO WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE GPA INFORMATION TO FOLKS OUT WORKING IN -- THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICES AT COLLEGES AND A AND UNIVERSITIES. WE SUGGESTED -- WE'VE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE THAT CALIFORNIA ADOPT A A NEW FRAMEWORK -- TO TO ITS A FINANCIAL AID FUNDING SIMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM ELIMINATING A LOT OF THAT THE RED RED TAPE. UP BY HAVING ONE CAL GRANT WE INSIST. I DIDN'T PUT THIS ON THE SLIDE BUT WE THOUGHT OF THIS AS KIND OF A SPREAD AND STACK APPROACH SO. ALL ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. A ELIGIBLE BASED ON THEIR NEED FOR A CAL GRANT -- PLUS THE INSTITUTIONAL AID GOING ON TOP OF THAT. AIMING TOWARD AND AFFORDABILITY TARGET THE AFFORDABILITY TARGET TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION UP ALL OF THE STUDENTS IS STUDENTS EXPENSES TUITION TUITION AND FEES BUT ALSO LIVING EXPENSES BOOKS TRANSPORTATION AND WHICH REALLY ARE THE AREAS WHERE WE ARE MOST LACKING IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS. AGAIN ESPECIALLY AT THE COMMUNITY -- BUT THAT THE US DID NAY COMMISSION AND COLLEGES WOULD BE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE ENOUGH GRANT AID WHERE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EITHER TAKE OUT THE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF LOANS. OR WORK TOO MUCH IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION AS A PART OF ALL OF THAT -- WE RECOMMEND SHIFTING FROM A SOLELY A TUITION FOCUS IN TERMS OF THE CAL GRANT SO THAT THE OVERARCHING GOAL IS NOT JUST TUITION COVERAGE BUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. I THINK IT'S USEFUL -- TO AT I REALLY ENJOY DOCTOR WEBBER'S QUESTION. AND HAVE HAD -- IT IT IT WAS USEFUL TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW TO ADDRESS IT BECAUSE IT WAS A HUGE QUESTION BUT ALSO KIND OF THE RIGHT QUESTION. BECAUSE YOU YOU CERTAINLY COULD IMAGINE A SYSTEM WHERE THE STATE. PROVIDED FUNDING TO INSTITUTIONS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT THAT STUDENTS NEED. AND TO PROVIDE STUDENTS TO PROVIDE EITHER ALL STUDENTS OR POTENTIALLY STUDENTS WITH NEED WITH -- LIVING EXPENSES SUPPORT -- OF BOOKS AT SET RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE FOR THE STATE TO PAY FOR ALL OF THAT. FOR EVERY UP RESIDENT INTERESTED IN IT AND ENROLLING IN HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT IF YOU BACK AWAY FROM THAT MODEL AND SAY WELL WHAT IF WHAT THE STATE WAS COMMITTING TO WAS SUPPORTING A ENOUGH GRANT TAPE SO THAT ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS. I EDUCATIONS WOULD BE AFFORDABLE GIVEN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. THAT IS CLOSER TO WHAT WE SORT OF HAVE AS A SYSTEM NOW AND THE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING BE -- THAT THAT THAT THAT THE UP GAPS BE FILLED -- AND SIMPLE OUR APPROACHES TO GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT A BE CREATED SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE. EVERYBODY CAN GO TO COLLEGE IT WILL BE AFFORDABLE FOR THEM IT'LL BE AFFORDABLE -- THAT PREDICTABLY AFFORDABLE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EVEN EVEN THEIR CHANGING ECONOMIC FAMILY ECONOMIC SITUATION SO THAT WHEN WHEN WE HAVE A RECESSION -- AID GOES UP TO SO THAT IT SO THAT IT BECOMES AN AFFORDABLE KIND OF APPROACH SO THAT'S WHAT WE AIM FOR IN KIND OF A THREE STEP -- APPROACH WITH THE WITH A FIRST STEP BEING LET'S BOLSTER THAT CAL GRANT BE AWARD TO ADDRESS THE BIGGEST HOLE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW BUT GIVEN THAT WE'RE TALKING KIND OF MASTER PLAN AND LONG TERM -- THAT LOOK THAT OVERARCHING GOAL OF LET'S MAKE SURE THAT. A QUALITY COLLEGE EDUCATION IS AFFORDABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS -- IS ACHIEVABLE. WE WANTED TO ALSO EMPHASIZE SOME THINGS THAT -- THAT. COULD BE DONE. BUT ARE NOT -- DON'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE UP A LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING SO IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY THAT I PROVIDED -- TALKED ABOUT PROVIDING EARLY FINANCIAL AID INFORMATION. AFFORDABILITY INFORMATION THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION CAL GRANTS AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL. AID IF WE WERE TO MOVE ALL OF THE INTER COMMUNICATION INTERACTIONS THAT OCCUR. UP RIGHT NOW BETWEEN ROUGHLY UP SEPTEMBER OF A OF A STUDENTS HIGH SCHOOL YEAR -- IF THE BAND AND THE SIX OR NINE MONTHS AYE AFTER THAT IF WE WERE TO MOVE WITH THAT LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THIS DEBATE COMMISSION AND THOSE STUDENTS. A YEAR OR TWO YEARS EARLIER. THEY COULD ACTUALLY HAVE INFORMATION THAT WOULD COMPARE. COST TO THEM AT A CSU CAMPUS A UC CAMPUS A PRIVATE COLLEGE CAMPUS -- SHOW THEM THEIR OPTIONS HELP THEM TO MAKE. DECISIONS THAT WOULD WORK WELL FOR THEM GIVEN THEIR BACKGROUNDS GIVEN THEIR INTERESTS HELPING TO PLAN FOR COLLEGE BETTER -- WITHOUT INCREASING OUR COSTS FROM WHAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS RIGHT NOW SO -- I STILL I I SOMETIMES WORRY THAT THE FOCUS ON PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO FINANCIAL AID -- WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO ADDRESS COMPLEXITY AND INFORMATION THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WHAT WE'RE SPENDING NOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH IT'S NOT WITH US SOLUTION -- BUT I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO KIND OF MOVE ON BOTH TRACKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I MISSED MEDINA CHAIRMAN DANA. BUT THANK YOU TO THE PANEL FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION AND I DO THINK A LOT OF INTERESTING QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY DOCTOR WEBER AND AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT FINANCIAL AID I DO THINK ABOUT [inaudible] ACCESSIBILITY. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE CHANGING CALIFORNIA. AND CERTAINLY COLLEGE HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS OF WHO GOES TO COLLEGE WHO CAN GO TO COLLEGE WHO THINKS ABOUT COLLEGE. RIGHT IF WE GO BACK THE BEGINNING OF YOU SEE. YOU KNOW IT WAS ONLY. I THINK A SPECIAL A SMALL GROUP OF FOLKS WHO COULD AFFORD OR THOUGHT ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE AND CERTAINLY. THAT IS CHANGE OVER TIME WHERE NOW WE TALK ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE TO ALL. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT COME TO MIND -- HOW ARE WE DIFFERENT HOUSES STATE A CALIFORNIA DIFFERENT? FROM SAY AN INSTITUTION LIKE HARVARD OR STANFORD WHO HAS I BELIEVE. NO PROBLEM WITH MONEY. FROM WHAT I'VE READ. YOU KNOW THAT IT'S YOU DIDN'T LIKE STANFORD AND HARVARD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND. ALL STUDENTS WHO ATTEND. RIGHT AND SO WE I THINK YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER ATTENDED STANFORD OR HARVARD -- BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO FIND. WHATEVER STUDENT COMES THROUGH THEIR DOOR -- HOW'RE HOW'RE HOW IS FINANCIAL AID IN CALIFORNIA DIFFERENT FROM THAT -- IT. CAN WE TRY THAT. WELL NOT NOT ALL CALIFORNIA. A PRIVATE STAR LIKE HARVARD AND STANFORD NO OUT OF STATE HOUSING CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL AID -- DIFFERENT WHITWICK WE'RE TRYING TO ALLOW. CALIFORNIA AND TO HAVE AXES TO SEE IT YOU YOU SEE AND PRIORITY ISSUE. AND AND AND IT AT FIRST I I WILL. THOUGHT OF ASKING THE QUESTION ARE BY NUMBERS YOU KNOW -- HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS? THE DO WE HAVE A NUMBER REVIEW IF I WROTE DOWN THE NUMBER TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCIALLY WE AWARD FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AWARDS. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THREE HUNDRED FIFTY INSTITUTIONS. THE INSTITUTIONS ARE OVER FIVE SECONDS CSU YOU SEE HOW MANY COLLEGES FOR PROFIT. PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT PRIVATE BUT THEY ALL HAVE TO BE WHAT'S GOOD CREDIT SO AT A PRIVATE. BRANSON'S WHAT'S COMPETITIVE. NONPROFIT A STUDENT CAN RECEIVE ABOUT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TUITION AND FEES AS COMPARED TO THE UC OR CSU TUITION AND FEES WHICH IS. WHAT ABOUT ALMOST SIX THOUSAND IT CSU AND ABOUT UP TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY OR SO I THINK SIXTY DOLLARS LESS -- AT UC. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS YES AND I WROTE DOWN STUDENTS. DID I HEAR THAT YOU KNOW HOW THAT THAT NUMBER AND GET TUITION AND DON'T PAY THEIR EDUCATION. FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND IN FACT HAVE 50% FIFTY EIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT IN UNIT REYES THAT STILL I DON'T PAY ANYTHING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHAT WOULD IT WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF C AND CSU STUDENTS. THAT -- RECEIVED FINANCIALLY. HIGHER SO 67% THAT'S THE ISSUE AND 66% AT UC SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX HAVE SOME FINANCIALLY. YES AM EVEN NOT YOU'VE SEEN THE WAY BECAUSE I AM. SYPHAC HERE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT CAL GRANT PROGRAMS SO THERE'S TWO BILLION FOR CAL GRANTS THERE'S ANOTHER TO SOME BILLION. IN TUITION REVENUE AT THE UNIVERSITY'S THAT'S BEING REDIRECTED AND AID AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF FEDERAL MONEY. SO WHEN YOU TALK TO YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR EIGHT MODEL THAT SAYS IF. WHATEVER YOUR FAMILY CAN CONTRIBUTE LET'S HARLEM ACTUALLY THEY THEY SET THIS UNIFORM WORK. LOAN EXPECTATION AND THEN THEY COVER THE RESIDUAL UP TO THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AT BERKELEY AS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND THEY EXPECT EVERYBODY THROUGH MARK IN LOANS TO DO. EIGHT THOUSAND LET'S SAY I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THE STATE'S LET'S MAKE IT TEN THOUSAND THEY WILL. I COME UP WITH THAT EIGHT REMAINING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SO THAT THE STUDENT CAN IN THERE OF PERSPECTIVE RECENTLY MANAGE BILLY IT'S HAPPENED. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS THAT SOME WHAT THE QUESTION THE DOCTOR WEBER PASSED AND IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION TO ME I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF STUDENT -- FINANCIAL AID AS MAKING A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STUDENT WHO COULD ATTEND AND NOT ATTEND. BUT THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT OF IT OR HOW I THINK OF IT. YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT FINANCIAL AID. X. NUMBERS STUDENTS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ATTEND. YOU SEE SERIOUS. OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible] SO BY. BUT BUT BUT IS -- SYSTEM A DIFFERENT SYSTEM IS THAT IT IS VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW -- ACCESSIBILITY TO ALL THESE NUMBERED THESE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS -- TO TO ATTEND COLLEGE. BUT WITHOUT FINANCIALLY. OUR MAN I KNOW I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ATTEND WITHOUT FINANCIAL AID A AT LEAST EQUALITY -- ENOUGH INSTITUTION OUT THERE ARE MANY MOVING PARTS OF ALL OF THIS YOU CAN HAVE A VERY LOW QUALITY INSTITUTION WITHOUT A LOT OF TEACHER STUDENT INTERACTION I SUPPOSE AND A BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ACCESS. TO QUALITY INSTITUTIONS OF THE MONEY EITHER NEEDS TO CALM THE MONEY FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE INSTITUTION EITHER NEEDS TO COME FROM THE STATE OR FROM TUITION AND IF A STUDENT CAN'T AFFORD IT THAT THE TUITION. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE. TO GO YOU ALSO NEED TO GUY CONSIDER THE STUDENTS ADDITIONAL COSTS SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN -- AND FOCUS ON THEIR THEIR EDUCATION AND NOT BE PULLED AWAY BY WORK OR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES SO THAT IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE AND IN THAT WAY -- THAT THE STANFORD'S IN HARVARD'S ARE ABLE TO MANAGE -- WITH -- WITH JEWISH AND BECAUSE THEY ARE SELECTIVE IN THEIR ADMISSIONS AND THERE THE THE CRITERIA THEY USE -- FOR FOR ACCEPTING PEOPLE TO THE UNIVERSITIES ARE HEAVILY SKEWED TOWARD -- HIGH INCOME FAMILIES SO A TH PROBABLY A THIRD OR MORE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ATTEND A STE THE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HARVARD OR STANFORD ARE PAYING FULL COST WITHOUT EVEN BOTHERING TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY -- AND AND SO THAT SO YOU KNOW -- PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT A HARVARD MAYBE TWELVE OR SO AT STANFORD -- AND 30% PLUS AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. CAMPUSES AND EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT AT AT CSU AND SOME COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT THE COUNTER ARGUMENT I SUPPOSE IS THAT THE AND I'VE. SEEN THE BOOKS WRITTEN RIGHT THAT. CALIFORNIA OR THE THE WHOLE COUNTRY COULD. OFFER FREE. COLLEGE THAT IT HAS THE MEANS BUT THAT WOULD -- ENTAILED SUB TYPE OF VERY AS WE SAID -- HIGH LEVELS OF OF SUPPORT IT WOULD BE A HIGH LEVEL OF INVESTMENT TO ANY OF THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE. ALL OF THE TUITION AND FEES THAT'S REQUIRED WHAT'S NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS LIVING EXPENSES WHICH IS OFTEN TIMES MORE THAN. A TUITION AT YOU SEE SO OFTEN TWELVE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LET ME DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU LIVE IN THE STATE BUT THAT IS WHAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY I THINK A PUBLIC COMMENT FROM THE STUDENTS THAT'S WERE VERY GENEROUS FINANCIAL AID -- STATE BUT THE COST OF LIVING TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE HERE THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO WORK TWO TO THREE JOBS AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH AND AS EVIDENCED BY REALLY THE TH. THE COMPLETION OF DEGREE COMPLETION YOU'RE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF THAT IN ADDITION TO OTHER STUDENTS SUPPORT THAT ARE NECESSARY REQUIRED BUT NO THAT'S ABSOLUTE TRUE YOU COULD PROVIDE. ALL THE HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS WITH ENOUGH TUITION TO COVER STUDENTS THAT NEED IT YOU WOULD STILL NEED THE COVER LIVING EXPENSES FOR THE ASTUTE. ADMIT THINK THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT ARE INTERTWINED AND IT MIGHT HELP TO TAKE THEM INDIVIDUALLY SO ONE IS JUST HOW MUCH MONEY TO PUT IN THE SYSTEM. AND I THINK AT THIS POINT THE WAY THAT THE NATION IS WORKING WHETHER AT STANFORD OR CALIFORNIA. THERE HAS BEEN AN ARRANGEMENT THAT THOSE WHO PAY WILL PAY AND NOT THOSE WHO CAN'T THE STATE WILL MAKE IT WHETHER AT STANFORD ARE THE STATE WERE TRYING TO COVER. AID FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS WHO WENT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ATTEND SO THAT'S A BASIC TRADEOFF WE CAN CHARGE HIGHER INCOME FOLKS LESS BUT IT WILL MEAN EFFECTIVELY DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR LESS THAT GOES TO FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS WHETHER IT WOULD BE FOR THEIR LIVING COSTS THEIR TUITION COSTS TO GET. THEM IN THE DOOR TO KEEP THEM THEIR FOURTH YEAR IT'S IN A JUST ON A MEDIA TRADE OFF AND THAT NOTS YOUR CONSIDERATION DO YOU WANT TO ACTION VERY LOW SO THAT YOU HELP ALL STUDENTS OF EVERY INCOME LEVEL OR DO YOU WANT TO TARGET. THAT'S THE BIG DECISION YOU FACE EVERY YEAR. THE SECOND ISSUE THOUGH THAT I THINK IS GETTING WRAPPED UP INTO THE CONVERSATION IS JUST WHAT DOES THAT NEED TO BE THIS COMPLICATED. IF IN REALITY IT'S FREE FOR HALF OF THE STUDENTS TO GO TO COLLEGE WHY ISN'T THE MESSAGE BEING CONVEYED TO THEM SO YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND REGARDLESS OF THE SEGMENT. IT IS NOTE IN. VIRTUALLY NO CHARGE FOR MANY STUDENTS AT ALL OF THE SEGMENTS WHEN YOU SEE SOME OF THAT NOT PRICES THAT CAN BE COVERED BY WORKING TWENTY HOURS A WEEK DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR SO NO KNOWN AS REQUIRED IN EVERY OTHER COST DISCOVERED. FOOD HOUSING TUITION IT'S ALL COVERED I THINK WHAT WE'VE EACH BEEN TRYING TO SAY AND DIFFERENT WORDS IS THAT THIS CALIFORNIA SYSTEM DOES NOT NEED TO BE THIS COMPLICATED. SO THAT THAT MESSAGE ISN'T GETTING RECEIVED IF THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING ROOM REALITY WHY DON'T WE MAKE IT CLEAR TO STUDENTS THAT THAT IS INDEED THE WAY CALIFORNIA WORKS. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WOULD REQUIRE AN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A STUDENT HAS TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR TUITION ASSISTANCE THROUGH THAT PROGRAM DEPENDING ON IF THEY KNOW THEIR GPA THEIR FAMILY INCOME THEIR ASSETS THEIR AGE AND HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN OUT OF COLLEGE. AND THEN THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT UC AND CSU PROVIDES THEM SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENT OR IF THEY SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS YES YOU WILL BACK PHILIP FOR THEM. AND IT'S JUST GETS OVERWHELMING WE HAVE A HARD TIME FIGURING IT OUT AS OUR JOB TO DO IT STUDENTS STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE IN SOME INSTANCES -- BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE LET'S HAVE ONE PROGRAM CALL THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S NOT HAVE SIX DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE THERE WILL BE AN EXPECTATION YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WORK MAYBE TWENTY HOURS A WEEK BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS COVERED. BUT THEN MAYBE WE NEED SIMPLER RULES LIKE HEY IF YOUR FAMILY INCOME IS LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL COVER IT BECAUSE MAYBE THEY DON'T GET THE FACT THAT RULES AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION -- BUT AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF SEPARATE ISSUE ABOUT HOW WE CONVEY WHAT THE STATE PROVIDES TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THAT THE COUPLE WHO ARE MENTIONED THAT'S CHANGED LOTS SINCE -- NINETEEN SIXTY IS BEST SUITED POPULATION IN THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION -- AND AND YOU KNOW WHERE STUDENTS ARE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM AS WELL -- AT YEAH I WILL POINT THEIR LIFE IS LIFELONG LEARNING BECOMES WHEN NECESSARY AND TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING -- YOU KNOW OUR ECONOMY AND AND THE ABILITY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THEIR JOBS -- HOW DOES OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM -- THERE HOW SHOULD OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM BE MODERNIZE TO BETTER MEET YOU KNOW THE NEEDS OF FOLKS. NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS LET'S SAY -- AND AND THEY ARE OR DOES THE CURRENT SYSTEM. INHIBIT THEIR ABILITY TO COME BACK TO COLLEGE. THERE ARE -- QUITE A FEW RULES -- IF YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A STUDENT EVEN -- ENTITLEMENTS CHEN COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE AT LEAST A TWO POINT NO YOU'RE IN PRETTY GOOD. SHAPE -- IF YOU HAVE A THREE POINT OWN MAKING MORE MONEY OR EVEN BETTER SHAPE. BUT PERSON THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT YOU KNOW BEYOND. TWENTY EIGHT AND YOU OF BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL FOR TOO LONG YOU GET ON THAT COMPETITIVE LIST WHICH IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS STRONG. AND I ONLY HAVE -- TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AWARDS THAT THAT AWARD IS WORTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO FOR A FULL TIME STUDENT FOR THE YEAR NOW IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH FOR US A STUDENT THAT GENERALLY HAVE THE FAMILY -- AND SO -- YOU WOULDN'T REALLY NEED TO NOT ONLY SUPPORT MORE OF THE STUDENTS BUT ALSO NEED TO SUPPORT. MORE OF THAT SORT OF AID TO THOSE STUDENTS AND MAYBE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THOSE SINCE THAT MAY NOT BE IN THE FORM OF LIVING EXPENSES BUT MAYBE OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM. TO TO BE ABLE -- TO GET THROUGH YOU KNOW FASTER SO ABSOLUTELY I THINK THEY'RE IN OUR CAL GRANT SYSTEM THERE ARE. DEFINITE AGE YOU KNOW OUR LIMITATIONS TRANSFER ENTITLEMENTS TINT BICU CAN'T COPY OF BE IT YOU CAN'T EVEN IF IT IS A MOTIVATED STUDENTS HAS BEEN IN THE SYSTEM PUBLIC TWO TO FOUR YEARS TRYING TO TRANSFER. IF YOU'RE BEYOND TWENTY EIGHT LINK YOU MADE OTHER CHOICES EARLIER ON YOU DON'T GET THAT TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT. SO YOU'RE OUT THOSE SORT OF WOMEN THE FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR YOU AT THE TIME AND IF YOU'VE EXHAUSTED YOUR EIGHT THEN. TOO BAD MEAN ALSO SO THERE ARE DEFINITELY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO FOR STUDENTS I MENTIONED EARLIER CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. KNOW THERE'S A WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND VOTES. IT I THINK SIXTY THOUSAND AWARDS AND I'M NOT REMEMBERING THAT CORRECTLY TWO THOUSAND WORDS GO ON USED. BECAUSE WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE -- WHETHER THEY'RE ON A PARTICULAR PATHWAY AND THEY NEED TO PROVIDE US WHETHER NOT THEY ARE ON A PATHWAY IN THE DATE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE DATA SYSTEM AND THE DISPARATE DATA SYSTEM THAT ALL OUR SYSTEMS DON'T CONNECT THEM TALK TO EACH OTHER. AND SO THERE'S NO WAY OF ME REALIZING OR UNDERSTANDING WHETHER OR NOT EX STUDENT THAT I HAVE IN MY FINANCIALLY SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY ON TRACK FOR A PARTICULAR -- YOU KNOW PATHWAY THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THIS THIS AWARD INSTEAD WE HAVE TO SET A SUPPLEMENTAL APPLICATION YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL UP IT DOESN'T REALLY GET RETURN. SO THERE ARE THINGS AND CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM MAKE IT HARDER FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE THERE IS AWARDS FOR NOT TO TAKE THE WORDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DO ONE MORE THING OR THEY HAVE TO KNOW TO DO ONE MORE THING YEAH. AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK THAT WE BUT IT'S REALLY SHARING INFORMATION NO. ONE INSTITUTION SHOULD OWN A STUDENTS INFORMATION ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO A STATE TO HIM AGENCY BEING ABLE SO THAT WE ALL SERVE THE STUDENT RIGHT. THAT'S COMPANY AND A LOT OF PRIOR DUH HEARINGS WE'VE HAD THEN THE NEED FOR DATA SHARING AND A DATA SYSTEM. BUT YET SO I I'M GLAD LUPITA MENTIONED THE AT THAT CAL GRANT SEE I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M WHAT GETS THE AWARD FOR THE STRANGEST UP PROVISION OF OF LAW BUT CERTAINLY SOME OF THE THINGS AROUND CAL GRANT SEE. I SEEM AN THAT TERRITORY WHERE I I THINK IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY HE BASICALLY CANNOT GET AN AWARD FOR A PROGRAM THAT GOES ANYWHERE AT IN OTHER WORDS IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT AND THEY ARE IN IS NOT TRANSFERABLE ONTO ANYTHING ELSE. AND WE HAVE CHANGED OUR THINKING ABOUT THE WAY THE WAY WE SHOULD THE PEOPLE. IT AND I THINK THAT MUST COME FROM A TIME WHEN YOU WERE TRAINED FOR A JOB YOU GOT THAT JOB AND THEN YOU ROSE IN THAT JOB AND AND THAT COULD BE YOUR LIFELONG CAREER AND NOW. NOW YOU NEED ONGOING TRAINING AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF A OF A OF A LIMITATION -- AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY ALLOWING STUDENTS TO ENTER WHAT WHATEVER PROGRAM. APPEALS TO THEM THAT'S THE WAY TO GET THEM. IN THE TO GO TO COLLEGE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND YOU CAN DO THAT YOU YOU WITH CHANGING THE CAL GRANT SO THAT IT IS STILL DOESN'T HAVE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT RESTRICTIONS BASED ON A TIME OUT OF SCHOOL -- AT A HIGHLY SPECIFIC A GPA REQUIREMENTS -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYBODY TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND IN MOST CASES THE TRUTH NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS IF THEY FIGURED OUT THE ANSWER IS. YOU'RE NOT EIGIBLE -- SO THAT'S WHY THAT THE THE EMPHASIS ON INCREASES IN PARTICULAR. FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING UP COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IT ALSO BRINGS UP THE POINT OF ADVISING AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE RESOURCES MORE GENERALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE VERY VERY STRETCHED IN THEIR STAFFING -- OUTSIDE FOR FOR SUPPORT SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDING FINANCIAL AID ADVISING AND EVEN THOUGH SOME STUDENTS UP MAY WELL THERE MIGHT BE. A TO THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THEM AYE GETTING SOMEBODY TO HELP WHO CAN WHO CAN HELP GUIDE THEM THROUGH THAT -- IS VERY DIFFICULT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE A THEY THE COMMUNICATIVE ONE RUN ON A SHOESTRING AND THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB -- BUT THAT KIND OF STUDENT SUPPORT THE NUMBER THAT THAT THE STUDENT. THE ADVISER RATIO IS IS SUCH THAT. IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THE KIND OF OUTREACH THAT WOULD REALLY HELP NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS AND YEAH AND AND YOU KNOW THAT THEIR LITTLE FROM MONEY COULD HAVE A BIG OUR ALLY IN TERMS OF STUDENTS GETTING THROUGH FASTER AND AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE ON I'M YOU ALL. MENTIONED THE INADEQUACIES SOME INADEQUACIES AROUND THE THE CURRENT CAL GRANT STRUCTURE -- AND ENCOURAGED -- REFORM OF THAT STRUCTURE TYPICALLY WHAT I'VE SEEN AND I HAVE BEEN HERE THAT LONG -- ANYTIME YOU REFORM SOMETHING OTHERS WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE LOSERS DURING A GOOD JOB OF KILLING THE REFORM BEFORE YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH IT. IS THERE FROM WHAT YOU'VE SEEN OF OF DIFFERENT MODELS FOR REFORMING THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM IS THEIR WAY TO DO THIS WHERE EVERYONE WINS. OR WILL WILL WILL THERE INEVITABLY BE BE SOME LOSERS THAT ARE GONNA -- YOU KNOW KIND OF TRY TO OPPOSE THOSE EFFORTS. I THINK THAT WE WE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THE FIVE SEGMENTS TRYING TO GET SOME IN A CONSENSUS AROUND AT LEAST THAT CONSOLIDATION AND IN GENERAL THERE'S A SUPPORT FOR CONSOLIDATION. BUT IT. IN THE END THE COMMITTEE CALLED SEGMENT DOESN'T REALLY WENT OUT THERE THREE STACKED ME BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY IN THEIR FAVOR. UNLESS THE BE ACCESS AWARD IS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY TO ASSIST THEIR STUDENTS SO. ALL BOATS HAVE TO RISE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL SEEN IN K. TWELVE AND COALITION WHEN THEY COME AND LOBBY ALL VOTES HAVE TO RISE IN ORDER FOR EVERYONE TO BE ON BOARD. WE'VE COSTED OUT THE CONSOLIDATION THAT WE HAVE THE CONSOLIDATION AND STREAMLINED TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE WERE TO INCREASE THE ACCESS AWARD TO THE LITTLE NEXT LEVEL UP IS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT THIS IS. WHAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR ROI WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IN THE CURRENT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE STUDENT SUCCESS THAT YOU WANT OUT OF IT SO THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT WHAT THE STATE WANTS AND WHAT THE STATE'S GETTING IT WITH REGARDS TO THEIR RETURN ON? INVESTMENT SO I DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTMENT -- AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SORT OF HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE IT SO THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE SEGMENT DOES FEEL THAT THEY'RE A PART OF A DEAL THE WINNERS. ABSOLUTELY -- I'VE MUCH MORE QUESTIONS BUT OWN RESPECTIVE ONCE TIMES THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON WILL BE FOLLOWING UP -- AND THEN FOR THE FUTURE CONVERSATIONS REALLY APPRECIATE YOU UP PARTICIPATING TODAY. THANK YOU. SO WITH THAT. I'M GONNA FIND MY SCRIPT BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE MOVING ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE IT IS -- SO NOW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAVE A LOT OF THIRTY FIVE MINUTES [inaudible] ISSUE. AND HAVE A LIST OF FOLKS WHO LIKE TO SPEAK -- SO AND WE HAVE A LIKE THE LIST OF FOLKS WHO WANT TO SPEAK SO FOLKS CAN LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO ONE TO TWO MINUTES AT MOST THAT WOULD BE GREAT -- AND PLEASE ALSO FOR FREE TO REACH OUT TO MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR ALAN GREEN WHO'S TO MY LEFT -- WHO'S THE POINT PERSON FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MY TEAM AND IF YOU SEND ALLEN AN EMAIL WITH YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS YOU CAN ADD YOU TO THE LIST SO YOU'RE KEPT IN THE LOOP AS WE PROGRESS. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM YOU IN DISCUSS THE WORK OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE WITH WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATION THAT HAS QUESTIONS US WHY TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK -- OLIVER STAM'S -- BUT ESPECIALLY ALLEN AND I LEGISLATIVE FELT WAS WITH SMITH WHO I DID ALL THE WORK TO A PUT TODAY'S HEARING TOGETHER ON THAT HAD ALL THE INTERACTIONS WITH THE PANELISTS AND? DIED DID THEIR BEST TO TRY TO MAKE ME SOUND SMART AS HARD AS THAT IS -- AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THE ALL THESE [inaudible] PUBLIC BECAUSE ANY MIKE CLOCK -- CLUNKY -- WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF THIS FIRST OF THE PACIFIC. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE HIS CLOCKING YOU'RE ON THE SECOND TRY THAT'S NOT BAD YEAH I KNOW WE KNOW THAT THE ARE THE CHALLENGE THE LEGISLATURE FACES AND HARM. DECISIONS WITH ALL SECTORS OF BUDGET CUTS HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THAT BEING SAID WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE THE CAN'T CAL GRANT DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS AS WELL AS THOSE FROM. EIGHTY PLUS OTHER PRIVATE NON PROFITS RELY AND THE GRANTS. LIMON ANECDOTAL EXAMPLE WE HAVE A COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT PROGRAM AT PACIFIC THAT FOR THE PAST FORTY NINE YEARS IS PROVIDING A GATEWAY FOR FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. FROM STOCKTON -- THEIR FORTY FIVE PEOPLE EACH YEAR IN THAT AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM RELY AND CAL GRANTS -- STATISTIC ONLY 18% OF ADULTS IN STOCKTON HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES WERE WORKING HARD TO TRY TO FIX THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO A LOT ON OUR END. WE'RE TEAMING UP WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WERE FULL SUPPORTERS OF SUSAN EGGMAN SITS EFFORTS TO DO A LOT [inaudible] FOR A CAL CAL STATE UNIVERSITY IN STOCKTON THE CITY OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AS A SELECT COMMITTEE CRAP SO LONG TERM VISION FOR HIGHER ED. IN THE STATE WE URGE THE MEMBERS TO CONSIDER THE CONTINUING AN ESCALATING FINANCIAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS ON EIGHTY TWO DIFFERENT PRIVATE NONPROFIT CARE CAMPUSES THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER COCKY. NEXT UP WE HAVE THOMAS VIEW IT AS YOU SEE YOU FOLLOWED BY. JUDITH GRAY GET I BELIEVE AT NOTRE DAME DE NAMUR UNIVERSITY. AND AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S TOM WHO I'M WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. ARE. USE THE ORGANIZATION OF TWO INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT SOME OF THEM ARE HERE TODAY INCLUDING UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC WHO JUST CAME UP. OF FIRST A THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THESE HEARINGS THAT THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR OF AND INVOLVING THE INDEPENDENT HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR -- THE INDEPENDENT HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR HAS BEEN A PART OF THE MASTER PLAN SINCE ITS CREATION BACK IN -- NINETEEN SIXTY IN HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE AND CREATING AND YOU'RE CREATING A CAPACITY FOR A STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN REGARDS TO US THE FINANCIAL AID FOR EACH DOLLAR THAT EACH OF OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE -- IN -- THEY'RE COVERING AWARD OUR INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE TWO DOLLARS SO DOUBLE -- I THINK THIS SHOWS THE COMMITMENT. THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO STUDENT ACCESS AND SUCCESS AND ESPECIALLY -- FOR THOSE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- AND FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORTS AND THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO STABILIZE THE CAL TO WORK FOR STUDENTS OF THIS YEAR -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CAL GRANT FOR THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR. IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF STATE AID THAT OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE. US WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR STUDENTS THAT THE AWARD IS STABLE AND PROPERLY FUNDED A HOWEVER THAT WHAT HAS NOT SEEN AN INCREASE -- US FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS NOW. AND GONNA CONSIDERING -- CUTS AND ALSO IN FOR SINCE THEN SCRUTINY OF THE AWARD HAS LOST SOMETHING OF AROUND 35% OF ITS VALUE -- IT. AND SO AS YOU BEGIN LOOKING AT HOW THE STATE CAN -- INCREASE ITS INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND IT REALLY IS AN INVESTMENT IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD -- AND HOW STATE FINANCIALLY A COMPLAINTS OF THAT YOU KNOW WE ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT INCREASING THE AWARD OVER TIME -- FOR OUR STUDENTS THROUGH A FORMULA -- THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION-THE AWARD AMOUNT OF THE UC'S AND OF THIS YES USE. RATHER THEN A LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND NEXT WE HAVE JUDITH CRAIG FOLLOWED BY JAKE BERMAN BERMAN ARE. I THANK YOU SO MUCH I YEAH. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROJECT THAT YOU'VE TAKEN ON IS MASSIVE AND IT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF WORK FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING IT ON JUST GREAT NOTRE DAME CHEN IN YOUR UNIVERSITY. OF A RESPECTED DOCTOR WEBBER'S QUESTIONS AND A HOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA'S QUESTIONS -- BUT DOCTOR ROBERTS QUESTION DOESN'T REALLY FIT FOR THE PRIVATE [inaudible] UP BECAUSE STATE AID GRANTED TO THE STUDENT IS THE ONLY KIND OF AID THAT A STUDENT PRIVATE WOULD GET AND YOU JUST HEARD FROM TOM THAT THAT IT'S A REALLY IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA STUDENT SO -- IT DOESN'T REALLY FIT. A IN THE SAME WAY SO WHILE I WANT US I'M A MEMBER OF THE STUDENT A COMMISSION WANT US TO SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK BOTH PRIVATE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY -- NONE AND OF POINT IT DIDN'T REALLY COMMIT TO STRONGLY IN THE TESTIMONY OF THE CAL GRANT ACTUALLY STARTED TO HELP STUDENTS IN THE PRIVATES BE ABLE TO ACCESS IN HELP. STATE FILL CAPACITY ISSUES THAT REMAIN TO THIS DAY FOR PROVISION OF HIGHER ED IN AND PRIVATE SECTORS REALLY STILL HAS NOT ONLY THE CAPACITY OPPORTUNITY BUT THE CHOICE OPPORTUNITY. A SMALL PRIVATE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR SOME STUDENTS AND WHEN WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RENDON IS QUESTION -- TALKED ABOUT THEM. WE HAVE A PRESTIGE SYSTEM IN THE STATE. IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT IN AID -- WE HAVE THAT KIND OF PECKING ORDER AMONG THE PRIVATES AS WELL. AND THAT'S WHERE AID BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AN INSTITUTION LIKE MINE. WE HAVE WE ENROLL AS MANY. LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION -- UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AS MANY OF THE AC. S. USED DO AND YET -- WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND RESOURCES THAT SOME OF THE PRESTIGE AND STE IT'S WHAT'S THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. I JAKE BERMAN ARE FOLLOWED BY LORE STUD SABO LUBITZ NOT SURE. WE'LL GET. SO CLEAN THAT UP. YEAH SO A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BERMAN AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU AND ELLEN AND ELIZABETH FOR BRINGING TOGETHER SUCH THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS ON ISSUE SO CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FUTURE -- JUST LAST WEEK THE CAMPAIGN RELEASED ARE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT CARD ON HIGHER EDUCATION IN WHICH WE ASSESS CALIFORNIA AND HOW IT'S DOING THAT FUNDING OUR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES TO MEET STUDENT DEMAND. AS WELL AS HOW AFFORDABLE THOSE OPTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO PACE THE GAP ONE POINT SIX MILLION COLLEGE GRADUATES BY TWENTY THIRTY AND THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT IF WE CAN CLOSE THAT GAP WE WANT YOUR CALIFORNIA BOTH RETAINS ITS STANDING AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WHILE ALSO CLOSING THE PERSISTENT RACIAL A MORE GOOD NEWS THE LEGISLATURE'S RECENT INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND YOU SEE CAPACITY IN PARTICULAR ARE WORKING PARTICULARLY FOR LATIN NEXT AND BLACK STUDENTS. AFTER ADDING SEATS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OVERALL ADMISSIONS INCREASED BY 5% BUT BY 9% FOR LATIN NEXT AND BLACK STUDENTS APPLYING TO THE YOU SEE. SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE THESE INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND CAPACITY UNTIL AT LEAST 40% OF OUR QUALIFIED HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES CAN ENROLL DIRECTLY INTO THE YOU SEE OR THE CSU. ON FINANCIAL AID CALIFORNIA HASN'T DONE SO WELL AT MAINTAINING THE CAL GRANTS PURCHASING POWER AT THOSE NON TUITION COSTS WERE CAUGHT HER TIME ON THE LAST PANEL CONTINUE TO RISE. THE DESPITE A MODEST INCREASES TO THE MAXIMUM AWARD UNMET NEED AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL AID HAS INCREASED BY MORE THAN MORE THAN DOUBLED AT THE CSU AND YOU SEE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE A WE STILL HAVE FAR TOO FEW GRANTS FOR COMMUNITY. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO PAY NO TUITION AND BUDGET CENTER REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT LAST YEAR THE PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS AWARDED A COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT. WAS LOWER THAN THE ADMISSION RATE AT UC BERKELEY. SOMETHING IS BROKEN WITH FINANCIAL AID WHEN IT'S HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO AND COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT MINUTE SPOT AT TALLIL SO I WE WOULD RECOMMEND CONCERT BOTH EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF THOSE COMPETITIVE AWARDS BUT LONG TERM TOWARD THAT VISION OF A CONSOLIDATED SIMPLIFIED GRANT PROGRAM THAT IS BASED. ON THAT THE NEED BASED PROGRAMS THAT WITH THAT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NEXT IS LAURA. SABO COUP IT'S FROM TI GUESS YEAH. GREAT JOB I CAN BARELY SAY AT THAT. AND YET FLORA SUB ACUTE IT'S FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS ME REALLY APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION TODAY IN PARTICULAR. ARE THE FOCUS BY PRISONERS ON THE CRITICAL NEED TO COVER AYE CRITICAL NINE TUITION COSTS FOR NEEDY STUDENTS. CLEARLY THE STATUS QUO IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND IT'S IMPERATIVE TO STRENGTHEN STATE NEED BASED AID BOTH BY INCREASING THE VALUE OF THE CAL GRANT THE ACCESS AWARD THAT HELPS COVER. AYE NEEDY STUDENTS NON TUITION COSTS AS WELL AS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMPETITIVE AWARD SO THAT MORE OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS MANY OF WHOM. RECEIVE AN AWARD THAT HELPS THEM GET TO AND SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH COLLEGE AND I KNOW THAT BOTH OF THESE ARE SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIANS FOR COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY ARE DIVERSE COALITION OF TWO DOZEN ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO JUST WANT TO QUICKLY NOTE THAT BOTH OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD HELP MITIGATE NET PRICE WHICH THE DATA SHOW PLACE THE GREATEST BURDENS ON OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS WE LOOK AT THE SHARE OF THEIR TOTAL INCOME THAT HAS TO GO TO ON COLLEGE COSTS AFTER. ON THE E. THAT THEY RECEIVE -- FROM THE WHAT WE ARE ALSO HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON OTHER WAYS TO BUILD TOWARD AFFORDABILITY. AYE AFFORDABLE HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA AND LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCUSS AND COLLABORATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU LAUREN AND NEXT THAT WE ARE DAVID POULTER FOLLOWED BY KIERAN FLAHERTY. I THINK IT'S EVER MEN AND STAFF DURING THE FIRST HEARING I COMMENT OF THE SILICON VALLEY SILICON VALLEY'S INNOVATION ECONOMY IS FUELED BY STEM TALENT BUT THAT ARE -- INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING WE'RE PRODUCING STEM GRADUATES AT A LOWER RATE THAN OTHER INNOVATION HUBS LIKE AUSTIN AND BOSTON. AND THAT IT WAS AS A RESULT MANY OF OUR COMPANIES ARE TURNING TO OUT OF STATE TALENT TO COMPETE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY IN SILICON VALLEY WERE BORN IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ONLY 18% -- PARTIALLY BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR LAST HEARING I WANTED TO RELATE TO THIS COMMITTEE SOME GOOD NEWS. OUR RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT ARE REGION'S GROWTH IN STEM DEGREES CONFERRED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN THE LAST YEAR STUDIED. EXCEEDED GROWTH AND OTHER COMPARABLE REGIONS SO 16% GROWTH IN STEM DEGREES CONFERRED FROM BAY AREA COLLEGES FOR INSTANCE VERSUS 10% IN AUSTIN AND BOSTON. ABOUT RAMPING UP THIS GROWTH RATES EVEN FURTHER BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGH FUNDING LIKE THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE. A IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY TO OUR INDUSTRIES BUT TO ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIANS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS HAVE A PLACE IN OUR INNOVATION ECONOMY. AGAIN I WANT TO ECHO EVERYONE ELSE'S WORDS THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND FOR YOUR OPEN FRAMING OF THIS WHOLE PROJECT -- I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUMMARY THANKS DAVID. NEXT UP WE HAVE KIERAN FLAHERTY FOLLOWED BY VALERIE JOHNSON. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN KIERAN FLAHERTY DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- I WANT TO START BY JUST THINKING YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES -- SOME OF OUR MOST ARDENT ADVOCATES FOR YOU SEE HAVE BEEN HERE AS PART OF THIS -- SUBCOMMITTEE. AND WE THINK WE HAVE MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES THIS YEAR AND THINGS HAVE REALLY -- STARTED TO TURN AROUND -- AS YOU ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SETTING UP A THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE IF PROCESS HAVING A SERIES OF OF FIVE HEARINGS TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE OF UNDERSTANDING. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE EVERY SEVERAL YEARS -- THINGS ARE CHANGING AND EVOLVING WITH RESPECT TO FUNDING SOURCES AND WITH RESPECT TO OUR FACULTY STAFF STUDENTS AND AND THE WORK FORCE NEED SO I THINK IT MAKES. GOOD SENSE FOR US TO COME BACK AND BE VISIT ALL OF THOSE THINGS. I IT DOES GIVE ME HOPE THERE IS A NATIONAL NARRATIVE OUT THERE THAT DOUBTS THE VALUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND WHAT IT CAN DO FOR A STATE OR WHAT IT CAN DO FOR INDIVIDUALS AND HEARING CALIFORNIA OUR ELECTED LEADERSHIP I RUN COUNTER TO THAT NARRATIVE. THEY DON'T DOUBT ABOUT THE VALUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REALLY BUILD ON WE HAVE A BEDROCK PRINCIPLE AT YOU SEE. AND THAT IS THAT QUALITY IS TANTAMOUNT WITH ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. WE DO THINK THAT WE CAN EVOLVE AND CHANGE AND IMPROVE THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR THAT THAT IS PART OF QUALITY -- WE ALSO THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AT THE SAME TIME TO GROW RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICE AS PART OF THE UNIVERSITY'S MISSION. AND AND WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THAT'S BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE ENGAGEMENT THAT YOU. AND YOUR STAFF HAVE HAD WITH THE UNIVERSE -- MY OFFICE AND THEN OTHER I'M YOU KNOW HERE AT THIS FINAL HEARING FOR NOW -- WE JUST WANT TO YOU I PLEDGE OUR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU -- WITH THE OTHER PUBLIC SEGMENTS AND THE INDEPENDENCE AND I CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER -- TO SEE SEE WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THANK YOU THANK YOU KAREN. UNLESS WE HAVE VALERIE JOHNSON FOLLOWED BY A HUNTER LAMELLAE AND HELLO MY NAME IS VALERIE JOHNSON AND I'M A STUDENT AT CRAFTED HILLS COLLEGE I ALSO SERVE AS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF SYSTEM AFFAIRS FOR THE STUDENT SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU CHAIR BERMAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR TAKING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. AND THE SYSTEM UNDER ADVISEMENT WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT A MASTER PLAN THAT WORKS ACROSS ALL THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS OF THANK YOU -- THE OVER TWO MILLION STUDENTS AT THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES. A THEY HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED WHEN ALLOCATING FUNDS FOR THE SCHOOLS. SO WHEN WORKING TO MODERNIZE THE PLAN TO BETTER THE MASTER PLAN UP PLEASECONSIDER THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE MANY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND THIS MUST BE CONSIDERED. WHEN ALLOCATING FUNDS AS IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS LIKE THEY REQUIRE -- ADDITIONALLY WE ASK THAT YOU SIMPLIFY AND MODERNIZE THE FINANCIAL AID PROCESS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR EDUCATION KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH -- SO THIS WOULD MEAN PROVIDING RETURNING AND NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO CALL GRANTS AND TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT. I'M SOCIALLY FOR STUDENTS AT A HIGHER YOU JUST MENTIONED IT BEFORE I'M STUDENTS IN THEIR LATE TWENTIES AND AND PASSED THAT HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLES SECURING THAT. FINANCIAL AID AND KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH GOING FORWARD -- ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD BE GREAT TO CONNECT PATHWAYS AND SYSTEMS BY DATA SHARING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO TAKE LESS STEPS TO GO AHEAD AND GET THAT FINANCIAL AID AWARD -- THE LAST UPSET THEY TAKE THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO MAKE IT TO THAT FINAL FINANCIALLY TOWARD. ADDITIONALLY -- WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THE BROAD COST OF ATTENDANCE THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE TUITION AND FEES SO MANY ASSUME THAT BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEY'RE LIVING AT HOME AND BEING SUPPORTED BY FAMILY MEMBERS. AND THIS IS NOT THE CASE -- A LOT OF THE TIME MANY HAVE FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN AND WORK MULTIPLE JOBS -- AND WE CANNOT ASSUME THAT THE HOUSTON PORTED OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL SO WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER -- THAT NEEDS OF OUTSIDE TUITION FEES. AND A LOT OF THE STUDENTS FACE FOOD INSECURITY THEY FACE HOUSING INSECURITY AND LARGE COST OF TRANSPORTATION -- SO PLEASE CONSIDER OFFERING FINANCIAL AID ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS CONSIDERATION WITH COST OF LIVING IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS MANY AREAS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS. AND THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE JUST NEED YOU TO PROTECT PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE ASK YOU ALWAYS KEEP STUDENT AT THE FOREFRONT. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATIONS WHEN YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VALERIE. NEXT OF WE HAVE ALL HUNTER LAMELLAE FOLLOWED BY ME -- CAGAYAN US [inaudible] KINDA CLOSE. ALL PARK MAYBE SOME FANATICS WILL HELP ON THE SHE THEM TIMES. HELLO -- CHAMBER BERMAN MY NAME IS TELEVANGELISM A RECENT GRADUATE OF LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE AND AS OF AUGUST WE SEVEN I WILL BE S. UNIT COST ONE BEACH -- I HAD SOME COMMENTS WERE IN EARLIER BUT AFTER SOME COMMENTS EARLIER TODAY I WANT TO ANSWER HOPEFULLY ONE QUESTION -- THAT BY ASSEMBLYMAN WEBER MENTIONED -- AND SHE ASKS THE CONSPECIFIC LEE YOU KNOW WHO ARE THE STUDENTS THAT ARE PAYING FOR EDUCATION AND WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY PAYING -- AND YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF THAT I THINK OF YOU KNOW THE FIRST GROUP THAT COMES TO MIND IS OUR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. WHO COME FROM A BACKGROUND THAT DOES NOT PRIORITIZE A CULTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION? AND DOES NOT EVEN PRIORITIZE OR KNOW HOW TO EVEN APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID. YOU KNOW WE HAVE STUDENTS THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU KNOW LIFE HAPPENS WE TALK ABOUT THE SITUATIONS AND ARE DEEMED INELIGIBLE FINANCIALLY WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF A LOW GPA OR SOMETHING. BUT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE MINDSET THAT SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT IF THEY DO HAVE A TO POINT A GP IN OUR DEEMED INELIGIBLE. IN SOME FORM IN THAT PROCESS THEY COME UP WITH TONS OF MONEY AND CAN FINANCE THEMSELVES AN UPCOMING SEMESTERS. YOU KNOW LEAVING THEM IN A VORTEX WHERE THEY HAVE TO FIND DIFFERENT WITH IT'S TO FINANCE THEIR EDUCATION EVEN GET OUT OF THAT. PASSAGEWAY XIN. IT ALSO ARE NOT TRADITIONAL STUDENTS WHO ARE BY WHATEVER METRICS ARE ELIGIBLE YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE -- FINDS -- BUT JUST YOU KNOW WHAT WHETHER IT'S TIME OUT OF COLLEGE TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL AND EVEN THEIR EIGHT SPECIFICALLY ADDING THEM ELIGIBLE FOR FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND YOU KNOW I WENT LOOKING ON THE FEW I CAN POLY GUARANTEE THAT SOME PEOPLE AND SOME FORMER WAY ARE STILL PAYING FOR THEIR EDUCATION. WHETHER THAT'S AND THAT REIMBURSEMENTS OR WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW LOOKING INTO A DIFFERENT POTENTIAL OR FUTURE DEGREE. I'M BUT SOME FORMS ARE ON THIS RUMOR EVEN PAYING FOR THAT AND YOU KNOW I ALSO WONDER STUDENTS I START SCHOOL ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH -- MY FIRST YOU HAD A COMMUNICABLE IT I WAS PAYING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST FOR HOUSING EXPENSES LOAN -- EVEN UNDERSTANDING THE CAL GRANT BE. JUST OVER A BROWN SIXTEEN HUNDRED YOU KNOW DOESN'T EVEN GET CLOSE -- TO THAT THE SIX THOUSAND I WAS BOTH THE PAIN. AND THEM ARE STERN ADVOCATES AND NONPROFIT PARTNERS HAS SPENT YOU KNOW YEARS IN MEETINGS LIKE THIS TRYING TO CONVINCE FOLKS. THAT EVEN NON TUITION COSTS ARE FACTORED A STUDENT SUCCESS AND WE HOPE IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS IN. YOU KNOW CONVERSATIONS LIKE THESE THAT WE HAVE MEANINGFUL DATA INCLUDED FROM YOU KNOW THE SEER SERVANT THINGS LIKE THAT. TO FINALLY CONVINCE FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS A FACTOR AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO A STATE THAT REALLY FUNDS STUDENTS -- AT A THRIVING ECONOMY YOU KNOW FIFTH IN THE WORLD RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL UNDER. THE NEXT UP WE HAVE MEDIA. FOLLOWED BY ISAIAH OF YOU IDEALLY CREWS. AND MIA SUFFER BUT SURELY LASTED PAST DECADE YOU'RE THAT FAR OUT. AND SO GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIR BERMAN MY NAME IS MIA QUE JANICE. AND I AM A STUDENT AT SACRAMENTO STATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CAL STATES UNISYS ASIAN BUT REPRESENTS ALL CSU STUDENTS STATEWIDE. WE FIRST WANT TO THANK THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE HEARINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST YEAR. STUDENTS LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE POLICY PROPOSALS THAT COME FROM THIS WORK. ONE CONVERSATION WE ARE CONCERNED TO HEAR IS THE UNRAVELING OF FINANCIAL AID TO ONLY FOCUS ON TUITION COSTS IN THE CSU. WHICH HAS ONLY ONE FOURTH OF WHAT IT COST TO ATTEND THE CSU. STUDENTS WHO HAVE THEIR TUITION COVERED ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH THAT HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD INSECURITY. AND ME MORE NOT LESS AID. ONE POINT THAT WE'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THE ABSOLUTE NEED FOR A MULTI YEAR FUNDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CAL STATE SYSTEM. CURRENTLY EACH YEAR THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES CREATES A FUNDING REQUEST TO THE STATE. AN INSTITUTION AND STAKEHOLDERS LIKE ICE ADVOCATE FOR A FULLY FUNDED BUDGET. YEAR AFTER YEAR WE COME HERE AND TELL YOU THE SAME STORY WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FLAVORS. A THRIVING CAL STATE SYSTEM AS THE ABSOLUTE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. THIS PROCESS IS ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTING AND IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY NOT WORKING. IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE CSU AT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE STATE AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T WORK FOR STUDENTS. WITHOUT A MULTI YEAR FOR THE BUDGET AGREEMENT WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH ALL OF OUR SHARED GOALS. LIKE INCREASE GRADUATION RATES AND LIMIT THEIR ACHIEVEMENT OR OPPORTUNITY GAP. WITHOUT A MULTI YEAR BUDGET AGREEMENT WE CAN'T COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSED THE NEAR THREE BILLION DOLLARS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG IN THE CSU. WITHOUT A MULTI YEAR BUDGET AGREEMENT MORE STUDENTS WILL BE TURNED AWAY FROM THE INSTITUTION BECAUSE NO LONG TERM ENROLLMENT STRATEGY CAN BE REASONABLY ADOPTED. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. STUDENTS ARE LEFT DEFENSELESS AGAINST UNPREDICTABLE AND VOLATILE TUITION AND FEE INCREASES. THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR THE INSTITUTION THE STUDENTS ARE ALL FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CASTING SYSTEM. WHICH IS WHY A MULTI YEAR FUNDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN ALL STAKEHOLDERS IS CRUCIAL TO LONG TERM SUCCESS OF THE CAL STATE SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEDIA. THEN EXCEPT WE HAVE EYES THE OF YOUR BILL THE CREWS FOLLOWED BY JONATHAN HUGHES I'M GONNA SPEAK FAST AS WE CAN GET ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS. FOR DECADES THE IDEALS THE MASTER PLAN HAS STOOD FOR HAS PLACED CALIFORNIA'S INSTITUTIONS AT THE TOP SORT OF A STATE ON A HILL IF YOU WILL. ONE IN PARTICULAR OWN FOCUS ON IS THAT ACADEMIC PROGRESS SHOULD BE LIMITED ONLY BY AN INDIVIDUAL'S PROFICIENCY. AS WELL NO EX IN ASSURING ACCESS TO ALL REGARDLESS OF SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND. HOWEVER IF WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS BY GRADUATION RATES STUDENTS A FULFILLMENT OF BASIC NEEDS AND EMPLOYMENT RATES. I'D SAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEGUN TO SLIP. I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN FOR CALIFORNIA TO REMAIN THE SHINING STATE ON THE HILL. WE NEED TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS NOW SO WE CAN REMAIN AN EXCELLENT INSTITUTION IN THE FUTURE YOU ALL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE PIONEERS. OF A GRANT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE A CHANGE WHICH WILL KEEP CALIFORNIA NOT JUST GREAT BUT SMART AGAIN. INTELLECTUAL AGAIN SUCCESSFUL AGAIN. AS A STUDENT WITH A FULL LOAD A THREE POINT SIX GPA AT ONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO ONCE HAD TO WORK FOR JOBS WHO ONCE HAD NEGATIVE FIVE DOLLARS IN HIS BANK ACCOUNT. AND WHO WAS LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY THE ANECDOTES OF HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS AT HIS CAMPUS AND OTHER CAMPUSES I'M FEW QUESTIONS THAT I HOPE WE CAN ALL RESULT. QUESTION ONE WHAT IS AFFORDABILITY [inaudible] QUESTION. TWO DOES OUR DEFINITION OF AFFORDABILITY INCLUDE FOOD HOUSING THREE CAN BE CUT COST SHOULD WE FOR IF WE CUT COSTS HOW WILL THIS IMPACT THE QUALITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. FIVE WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA OR NEW YORK [inaudible] SIX UP. IN CONCLUSION IF BASIC NEEDS ARE PROVIDED FOR THEN AS I AS WE ALL KNOW FULL ACADEMIC POTENTIAL NEVER BE REACHED. LASTLY I HAVE ONE MORE THING TO DO. I'M CONVINCED THAT IGNORANCE WOULD BE DISMISSED ONLY IF EDUCATION WAS OUR FIRST OFFENSE STUDENTS WERE TENSE BECAUSE OF THE COST OF PAYING RENTS ALL TIME IS SPENT WORKING TO TO FOR JOBS. WE WERE BORN AND CURSED POR IS THIS WHAT LIFE WAS MEANT TO BE. NO TIME TO STUDY WERE FOREVER STRUGGLING AT THE BOTTOM OF MASS LOW'S HIERARCHY. I'M NOT A POET I'M JUST A PRUDENT STUDENT WHO BELIEVES THAT HUMANS SHOULD RECOGNIZE LIFE'S IMPROVEMENT. CRITICAL THINKING IS ON THE BRINK OF SINKING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CONTRIBUTED BINGE DRINKING THE STUDENT BODY IS DROWNING IN A SEA OF DEBT WE NEED.

HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MYLES WATKINS PRESIDENT CEO OF ASSOCIATES TO THE CORPORATE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY EAST BAY IN BEAUTIFUL HAYWARD CALIFORNIA. I HEARD A LOT OF THINGS SAID TODAY. A LOT OF TWENTY FIVE CENT WORDS A LOT OF THIRTY CENT WORDS. BUT THE ONLY METRIC THAT MATTERS IN THIS IS OUR REALITY. STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS AND HUNGRY ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TOLD WHAT COLLEGE ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT WERE ONLY WORRIED ABOUT TUITION. NOTHING NOTHING'S GONNA GET DONE EVEN TODAY ME AND MY VICE PRESIDENT WERE SPEAKING AT MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL I GREW UP TEN MINUTES AWAY FROM HERE IN THE THOMAS. I WAS SPEAKING TO THEM AND THEY WERE ASKING DO YOU GET SCHOLARSHIPS FOR TUITION AND I SAID. OH YEAH I DO BUT THAT'S WE LESS THAN WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS. 40% OF CSU STUDENTS ARE FOOD INSECURE 10% ARE HOMELESS AND AT OUR CAMPUS GENERATION. BIGGER ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THIS. AND AS A STUDENT LEADER AS PRESIDENT CEO OF MY STUDENT BODY SHIRLEY WAS HERE I KNOW HER A A SIGH PRESIDENT FROM SANDY OPENINGS CHRISTOPHER THOMAS. THIS I IF I PRESIDENT FOR SAN WAS PAYING HIS NAME IS JUAN CARLOS HERNANDEZ. SINCE ENORMOUS STATE THAT'S CARLY CHATTERLEY AND IN SAN JOSE STATE THAT'S OUR YARD NOW MANZO WE ARE ALL HERE. TO HELP STUDENTS. BE THE FOCUS OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU PRESIDENT WALK INS. NEXT UP WE HAVE DAVID BALA HAWKINS FOLLOWED BY MARIO. DOUG OF ERA CORVAIR [inaudible] CORDERO. THAT MISTER BERMAN THANK YOU OUT FIRST EIGHT THAT DIED LIKE TO RECOGNIZE YOUR STAFF AS WELL THEY'VE -- THEY'VE JUST BEEN OUTSTANDING VERY RESPONSIBLE AND WE'VE THINGS -- YOU KNOW HEARING THE STUDENTS SPEAK I'M I'M REALIZING HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG LONG TIME -- I USED TO BE THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN WE HAD FORMULA DRIVEN BUDGETS. AND SO BASED ON STUDENT POPULATION YOU HEARD SO MANY FACULTY SO MANY STAFF SO MANY MANAGERS UNDER THE PETE WILSON ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET WE THROUGH WHAT WAS CALLED THE ORANGE BOOK AWAY. AND NOW WE GIVE A PART OF MONEY TO THE CSU AND TRUSTED THAT THEY'RE GONNA SPEND IT ACCORDINGLY. AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT IT IS IT IS THAT IT'S NOT WORKING. THE CURRENT FUNDING MODEL FOR THE CSU. IS NOT WORKING WE EVEN TOOK THEM OUT FROM BEING UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR OVERSIGHT. AND YOU FOLKS DON'T KNOW HOW THEY SPEND MONEY YOUR BUDGET PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW HOW THIS YEAR SHE'S BEEN SPENDING. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME OTHER SPECIFIC EXAMPLES SUB BASED ON IT TO THOUGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AUDIT THAT DOCTOR WEBER ACTUALLY AUTHORED -- THAT THE CSU EMPLOYEES UNION WHO I WORK FOR NOW AROUND ACTUALLY SPONSORED. GROWTH IN MANAGEMENT OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD WAS DOUBLE THE RATE. OF THE GROWTH IN CSU SUPPORT STAFF. COMPENSATION FOR MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS CRUDE A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS HAVE THE CSU BUDGET. THE AUDITOR STATE AUDITOR CONCLUDED THAT SEE IF YOU CAN'T BUSINESS CANNOT ADEQUATELY JUSTIFY THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND THEIR COMPENSATION. THE AUDITOR SAID THAT HE IF YOU CAMPUS IS QUOTE. DO NOT ADEQUATELY OVERSEE THEIR BUDGETS. WHICH REDUCE ASSURANCES THAT STATE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT EFFICIENTLY. AND APPROPRIATELY. WE'VE GOT EXECUTIVES AND EARNING A CLOSE TO A HALF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR NOW. HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THEY DON'T GIVE JUST SALARIES. THEY GET A HOUSING A LAMB WITH HIS THE RANGE FROM FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. CARL OUNCES FROM ELEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND MANY OF THEM GET FOUNDATION MONEY OF UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SEE IF YOU ALSO HAVE ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE TREASURY. YOU KNOW THAT. THESE THE CAN'T EVEN HAVE THE BANK OF THE CSU WHICH AT WHICH I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. THOSE THOSE OUTSIDE OF COUNT IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WERE ONE POINT [inaudible] EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. HIS NOW GROWN TO THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS MAJORITY OF THAT MONEY IS STUDENT TUITION. THERE'S EASILY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF THIS YEAR IF YOU CAN SPEND ON ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. AND YET THEY'RE WALKING AROUND THE BUILDING TO A TALK MIGHT HELP. POOR THAT THEY WERE THIS YEAR. AND WHEN YOU WORK HARD MISTER BERMAN TO GET MONEY FOR THE CSU WHAT DID THEY DO THEY GAVE SALARY INCREASES TO THEIR EXECUTIVES DOWN AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE [inaudible] SO. FOR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE COULD IMPROVE THIS QUICKLY PLEASE YOU BET. ONE IS BUT THE CSU BACK UNDER THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THE THEY AREN'T SPENDING MONEY ON THE EXPERTS THAT FINANCE ALREADY HAS. SECONDLY LOOK AT POSSIBLY INSTITUTING SOME MORE FUNDING FORMULAS. AND NOT JUST GIVE THEM A PART OF MONEY INTEREST IS GOING TO BE SPENT ACCORDINGLY. THREE LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AND HOW MUCH CAN BE SPENT ON ADMINISTRATION OF THE CSU BUDGET. AND FINALLY DISALLOW THIS YEAR IF YOU FROM HAVING ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE TREASURY THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE HAVE MARC ARE MARIO GUERRERO FALL BY CYNTHIA CASTILLO. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BERMAN MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION SWANTE TO THINK HOW MY COLLEAGUE THAT WENT BEFORE ME DAVID UP FOR HIS COMMENTS -- ALSO WANTED TO THINK YOU FOR THE SERIES OF HEARINGS -- CFA AS YOU MAY KNOW REPRESENTS THE TWENTY NINE THOUSAND OR SO PROFESSOR'S LECTURES LIBRARIANS AND CANCERS COACHES WHO TEACH IN THE CSU. I AM I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE. YOU DID A GREAT -- SERVICE TO OUR STUDENTS BY YOUR FUNDING THIS YEAR THAT ALLOWED IT ALLOWED OVER THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL STUDENTS TO ATTEND THE CSU THIS COMING YEAR AND FOR THAT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU THAT. IS ALL ABOUT THE STUDENTS -- HOWEVER WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCE WITHOUT REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE THIRTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS THE QUALIFIED FOR A SEAT FOR THE CSU BUT WERE NOT ADMITTED TO DEFINING THIS PAST YEAR -- WE BELIEVE THAT ANY FINANCING PLAN NEEDS TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND ALSO REFLECT THE FULL FUNDING NEEDS OF THE STATE INCLUDING -- THE STUDENTS LIVING EXPENSES UP FINANCING SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE CS USE OUR ABILITY TO OFFER APPROPRIATE LEVEL. STUDENT SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT THE CSU HAS A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS. TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS WE ALSO KNOW THAT STUDENTS ARE DE ARE DEALING AS YOU'VE HEARD ARE DIRECTLY FROM THEM WITH FOOD AND SECURITY. AND OR HOMELESSNESS ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE AT LEAST. ONE THING IN COMMON IT'S FUNDING WE NEED TO FUND THE SYSTEM APPROPRIATELY TO INCREASE ACCESS AND QUALITY EDGE OF EDUCATION. FINALLY STUDENTS ARE DROWNING IN DEBT ONE I THINK THAT YOU SEIZE FOR GIVING A ARE GIVING THEIR STUDENTS A REDUCTION IN TUITION AND FEES. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY'VE DONE THAT IN OVER TWENTY YEARS WE'RE WAITING FOR THE CSU TO SEE WHAT THEY DO -- WHAT WE REALLY NEED AT THE END OF THE DAY IS UP THE POLITICAL WILL TO CREATE A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE TO FULLY AND ADEQUATELY FUND THE CSU -- IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE AND IN OUR FUTURE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARIO NEXT ABOVE CYNTHIA CASTILLO FOLLOWED BY.

MY COMMENTS WILL BE FOCUSED ON THE FIRST. CONVENING THIS MEETING BUT FACT FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE OPEN TO ALL REGARDLESS OF STUDENTS BACKGROUND RACE OR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. WE REMAIN VERY SKEPTICAL THAT THE PERFORMANCE SPACE FUNDING FORMULA LINES WITH THE MASTER PLAN. SO WE AGREE WITH MARK MARTIN'S PREPARED ANALYSIS FOR THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB TO WHERE HE SAID. THAT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW PUNISHING COLLEGES WITH POOR PERFORMANCE BY REDUCING FUNDING WILL LEAD TO BETTER PERFORMANCE WHAT WE KNOW WITH THIS FUNDING FORMULAS THAT IF IT. ATTRIBUTES A POINT SYSTEM THAT WE THINK VALUES FULL TIME STUDENTS OR PART TIME INVALUABLE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER OVER CARE AND CT  <u><c.green>COURSE SAYS.</c></u> AND AND SO SO ON AND SO FORTH. SO WE ENCOURAGE A CLOSER EXAMINATION AS TO HOW TO IMPROVE THE FUNDING FORMULA. THE POINT SYSTEM THAT IT HAS.
