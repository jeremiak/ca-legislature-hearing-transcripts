00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:21.693
OUR RESEARCH SURPLUS SINGER

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.128
MARIE DISPOSITION AND THE REST

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.462
INCLUDING OUR WORRY [inaudible]

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:28.400
RENOVATION -- AND MY CONCERNS

HAVE TO DO WITH THAT A MAYES YOU

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:31.136
MAY KNOW.

00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:32.704
WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY ARMORIES IN

00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:34.139
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:35.307
IN NEED OF RENOVATION MANY OF

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:36.541
THESE WERE BUILT IN THE FORTIES

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:38.510
AND THE FIFTIES WHEN.

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:40.545
OF FEMALES WERE NOT SERVING IN

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:41.646
THE NATIONAL GUARD FOR THE MOST

00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:44.282
PART ONE NOW THEY ARE -- AND

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.518
MOST OF THESE ARE SOLDIERS --

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.553
THEIR FIELD UNITS.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.322
MANY OF THOSE ARMORIES HAVE NO

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:51.723
FEMALE RESTROOMS ARE CHANGING

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.224
FACILITY.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.493
SO WHEN WE A SURPLUS ARMORIES IN

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.628
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:58.563
HISTORICALLY WE HAVE TOLD THEM

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.998
THAT SOME PRICE OF THE STATUTE

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:01.700
SAYS MARKET PRICE BUT WE KNOW

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:03.368
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:03.902
THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:05.904
SERVICES AND MILITARY DEPARTMENT

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:07.672
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FINANCIAL.

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.374
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE LOCAL

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:10.542
ENTITY THAT TRYING TO ACQUIRE

00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:12.210
THEM.

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:13.345
AND MANY OF THEM ARE NOT IN

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:16.081
SANTA BARBARA -- BROLLY COMES TO

00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:19.384
MIND IT'S THAT ARE SIMILARLY

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:20.518
SITUATED I'M SURE THE CITY OF

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:21.987
RIDLEY.

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:23.455
SO WHEN THESE ARMORIES ARE SOLD

00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:25.223
THE PROCEEDS ARE PUT INTO WHAT'S

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.058
CALLED AN ARMORY FUND AND AN

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:28.693
ARMORY FUND IS USED.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.429
WITH OTHER FUNDS. TO REMODEL

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.365
THESE ARMORIES AROUND THE STATE

00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:35.300
AND IT'S ABOUT A FOUR FIVE

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.836
MILLION DOLLAR TAB -- REMODEL

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:39.237
GIVE OR TAKE [inaudible]

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:42.240
THE THERE'S SOME SPLITTING OF

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:44.276
THE ARMORY COST WITH THE FEDERAL

00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:46.111
GOVERNMENT STATE AND FEDS BUT

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:47.545
I'M CONCERNED IF WE STARTA

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:49.915
PRACTICE OF OF NOT CAPTURING AT

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:51.650
LEAST SOME.

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.652
THE MONEY OUT OF THE DISPOSITION

00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:55.153
OF OUR WORRIES THAT WE MAY.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.554
INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY TO

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:57.856
REMODEL THE ARMORIES THAT ARE

00:25:57.923 --> 00:25:59.024
CURRENTLY UTILIZED BY ARE

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.659
CURRENTLY SERVING.

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:02.661
MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM.

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.996
NOT TO DIMINISH THE NEED THAT WE

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.898
HAVE TO SUPPORT VETERANS BUT WE

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:08.366
NEED TO BALANCE.

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:09.935
BUT WE DO SO THAT WE ARE

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:12.604
PROVIDING SERVICES FRANK TO BOTH.

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:14.773
COMPONENTS SO HAVING SAID ALL

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:16.808
THAT I'VE MADE THE MOTION AND

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:18.510
FIRMLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.178
I NOTED THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE

RIDLEY AFTER FIVE YEARS.

00:26:23.548 --> 00:26:25.717
EARLY AT NO COST.

00:26:25.784 --> 00:26:27.352
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:28.820
DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.121
THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT.

00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:32.223
AND NEGOTIATED THE PRICE DOWN TO

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.992
WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:35.460
200-100-02200 FIFTY THOUSAND FOR

00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:38.029
THE ARMORY IF I'M WRONG MAYBE

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.664
BECAUSE I'M NOT THE NEGOTIATIONS --

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:40.966
AND MAYBE THAT'S TOO MUCH AND I

00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:42.367
UNDERSTAND SMALL CITIES ARE

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:43.668
FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED ACTUALLY

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:44.936
ALL CITIES ARE FINANCIALLY

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:46.871
CHALLENGED IN THE STATE LARGELY

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:48.840
DUE TO WHAT WE DO HOME UP HERE.

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:51.142
BUT HAVING SAID THAT IF WE ARE

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:54.245
GOING TO START PRACTICE.

00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:55.647
I'M ASKING THE AUTHOR TO TAKE A

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:12.690

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:13.758

SERVING ON THE STATE SENATE ALL

00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:47.992
RIGHT ON THE AUTHOR I MEAN WE

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:49.828

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.362
SIDE THAT -- ON THIS PIECE OF

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:51.963
LEGISLATION OF THE SPRING IT

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:52.197
TODAY.

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.465
I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION BECAUSE

00:28:53.531 --> 00:28:54.699
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW IT

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:57.102
TRANSITIONS AND IF IT GOES FROM

00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:58.136
THE STATE RIGHT NOW THE STATE

00:28:58.203 --> 00:28:59.237
DOESN'T ANY.

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:00.972
TAXES RIGHT ON THE PROPERTY IF

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:05.210
IT GOES TO AND THE VETERANS

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:06.978
COMMUNITY DOES IT.

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:07.812
DEBATE IN YOU GUYS ARE GONNA

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:09.214
FIGURE THAT OUT.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.515
I BELIEVE IN THE BILL IS THE

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.750
PROPERTY TRANSFER OKAY WE WE GET

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.252
FROM THE FANS BURKE.

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:16.254
BUT WE WOULD THEN.

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:18.656
LISA THE CENTRALLY AT NO COST TO

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:19.591
THE RIVER AREA BATS THEY HAVE

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:20.558
DEALT WITH THIS ARMORY SO WELL

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.060
OVER THE PAST DECADE WE DON'T

00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:23.728
WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THEIR

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:24.796
BUSINESS THERE THEY'VE BEEN

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:25.396
DOING THERE.

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:26.364
VERY WELL GREAT OKAY I'M JUST

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:27.265
CURIOUS ABOUT THE TAX STRUCTURE

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:28.600
I WASN'T SURE IF THAT HAD BEEN

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:32.837
ADDRESSED AND SO I JUST WANNA

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:33.571
MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT.

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:36.207

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.313
THIS BILL MAY NOT BE THE TARGET

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.615
OF OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE THINGS

00:29:43.681 --> 00:29:43.815

ALEXANDER OFFICE TO GASP WHICH

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:50.221
NEED TO BE DONE.

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:51.689
IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE WE HAVE

00:29:51.756 --> 00:29:52.624
HOPE IS THIS MAY REQUIRE A

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.926
LITTLE BIT A STUDY.

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.195
CERTAINLY THE CRITERIA MAYBE FOR

00:29:57.262 --> 00:30:00.431

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:02.934
HARDSHIP CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:04.035
BUT MAYBE JUST SOME NON

PRESIDENTIAL LANGUAGE COULD BE

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:07.038
INSERTED HERE.

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:09.874
IN IN THE BILL THIS IS NOT A

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.543
PRECEDENT OBLIGING.
