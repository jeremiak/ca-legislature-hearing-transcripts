DO THE SCHOLARLY WORK.

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:39.295 region:rollup2
FIGHT THESE CHALLENGES OF RACISM

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:40.663 region:rollup2
THAT HE FOUGHT REGULARLY IN FACT

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.865 region:rollup2
HE OFTEN SAID THAT ONE OF THE

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:44.167 region:rollup2
THAT HE HAD. HE KNEW OF RACISM

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:45.701 region:rollup2
AND HAD EXPERIENCE OF SOME OF IT

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:46.569 region:rollup2
IN THE SOUTH.

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.671 region:rollup2

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:57.180 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:58.915 region:rollup2

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:00.183 region:rollup2
OF RACISM.

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:01.350 region:rollup2
WHEN HE BECAME A PROFESSOR AT

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.720 region:rollup2
PLACE TO LIVE THERE'S NO ONE ONE

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:06.589 region:rollup2

HE NEVER FORGOT FROM WHENCE HE

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:16.132 region:rollup2
CAME.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.599 region:rollup2
