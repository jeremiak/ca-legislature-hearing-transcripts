THE CHIEF COUNSEL MISSION FOR NAIL. CHIEF DEPUTY COMMISSIONER MISS RANDA SKIP A DONOR. THE ASSOCIATE CHIEF ALI THEIR NAM ALONG WITH THE ALL THE ADDITIONAL SOCIAL CHEESE. LASTLY THE BACKBONE OF THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS THE SUPPORT STAFF. IN THE AMAZING ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES DEPUTY COMMISSIONERS THAT I WORK ALONGSIDE. I BRING TO THIS POSITION HAVE NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. BEFORE OF THE POINT IS COMMISSIONER HAD THE HNOR TO SERVE AS A MINISTER OF LAW JUDGE TO BE COMMISSIONER. FOR THE BORDER PAROLE HEARINGS WERE AND I WORKED ALONGSIDE HIM THE MOST DEDICATED KNOWLEDGEABLE LEGAL MIND TO CALIFORNIA. PRIOR TO THAT I WAS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE HILL NUMEROUS HEARING OFFICERS POSITIONS. MY BACKGROUND EXPERTISE HAVE GIVEN ME A GREAT DEAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE EXPERTISE IN THIS AREAAS WELL. AND A PLACE GREAT VALUE IN PUBLIC SAFETY TEAM WORKS AND EMPATHY. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMA. WE WILL MOVE INTO COMMENTS OF OF THE RULES COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MR ROTH SENATOR ROTH I'M GONNA START WITH YOU IF THAT'S OKAY THANK YOU. I THINK YOU MENTIONED. CONGRATULATIONS TO BOTH OF YOU. YEAH WE HAVE A VARIETY OF EXCUSE ME REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO FOLKS IN OUR IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM AND WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IS. AS ELECTED SIN WAS REBUILT TATIAN PROGRAMS IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEM -- IN YOUR CAPACITY IS WHAT TO WHICH OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS DO YOU FIND. HAVE YOU FOUND TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE. OUR BEGIN BY STATING THE VICTIMS AWARENESS PROGRAMS. BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES TO BE IN MAKES AREN'T REALLY. AWARE OF THEIR VICTIMS AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR VICTIMS INTO LATER ON IN THEIR CORPORATION. AND MANY OTHER BIG AND AWARENESS PROGRAMS ACTUALLY HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT BY THE INMATES ARE CONFRONTED WITH OTHER VICTIMS OF FAMILY VICTIMS. AND WHEN THEY SEE THE EMPATHY THAT. THE VICTIMS OF THE NEXT OF CAN HAVE. FOR THE INMATES THEY REALIZE NUMBER ONE THERE HARM AND ALSO FORGIVENESS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IS THIS PART OF REHABILITATION. IS HAVE AN INMATE'S. FORGIVING THEMSELVES FOR THE CRIMES AND THAT WAY THEY CAN BEGIN THE PROCESS OF REHABILITATION. I THINK A LOT OF MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT -- ARE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL PROGRAMS THAT REALLY FOCUS ON BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND REALLY CHANGING THEIR THINKING. IT HAVE HAVE BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND AND VERY EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY -- MAKING SURE THAT OFFENDERS ARE ACTUALLY CHANGING SO -- THERE ARE PROGRAMS NOW THAT THERE REALLY FOCUSING ON CHANGING THINKING PATTERNS -- CHANGING THE WAY. ONE OF THE PROGRAMS NOW THAT SOME BASED ON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL -- THERAPIES IS -- BUT THE LONG TERM OFFENDER PROGRAM AND MANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL THINKING WHICH REALLY GETS TO THE THINKING PATTERNS THAT THEY HAD AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME. AND ALLOWS THEM TO REALLY REFLECT BACK ON THAT AND THEN REALLY START TO WORK ON CHANGING THAT BANKING WHICH THEN. WILL CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR SO I THINK A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON BEHAVIOR CHANGE -- ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE. IN YOUR IN THE PAROLE BUSINESS SO. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE INTERESTED IN IN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THAT SITUATION. HARPER GIVEN THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO SUCCEED TO SUCCEED IN LIFE AND MOVE MOVE ON PAST THE PERHAPS PAST MISTAKES. HOW EFFECTIVE IS CDC ARE IN PROVIDING SUPPORT SERVICES -- TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON PAROLE IN TERMS OF ALLOWING THEM TO REENTER SOCIETY ARE YOU IN A POSITION. TO TO MAKE A STATEMENT ON THAT. I AM IN IN BECAUSE OF THE DEDICATION FOR MANY YEARS AND I ALSO DEALT WITH PAROLE VIOLATORS. AND SO I SAW ALL THE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THEY HAD IN THE COMMUNITY WITH REGARDS TO CONTINUE IN PROGRAMMING. AND THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED THEY HAVE A PROGRAM INSIDE THE INSTITUTION BUT WANTS TO RELEASE IT HAS TO CONTINUE ONE BECAUSE THERE REALLY BILL TATIAN HAS TO CONTINUE. BECAUSE THIS LIKE THE EXISTING WANTED ATTIC ALWAYS AN ADDICT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE AWARE. OF THEIR ISSUES AND ALSO MAKE SURE THE PROGRAM IS STILL STILL THERE IN YOUR LIVES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AS COMMISSIONERS -- HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO DO IS IMPOSE SPECIAL CONDITIONS ON PAROLE SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS SAY. WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO RE RELEASE -- THIS PERSON WITH -- THE SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND WE CAN IMPOSE CONDITIONS THAT INCLUDE EXTRA PROGRAMMING WE CAN REQUEST THAT THEY OR WE CAN ORDER THAT THEY GO TO A FOOT YOU KNOW POSSIBLY -- LIKE A FIFTY TWO WEEK BETTER SCORES OR CONTINUE THEIR A ES IN RECOVERY -- BE IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS A YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT TRANSITION THEY GET THAT ASSISTANCE THAT -- PROVIDED IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SO WE HAVE -- THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO BE IN ORDER EXTRA -- SPECIAL CONDITION SO THAT IT REALLY ASSIST THEM AS THEY RE INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY OUR OUR SPECIAL CONDITIONS IMPOSE VERY OFTEN. I PROBABLY HAVE NOT HAD A HEARING THAT I DIDN'T IMPOSE A SPECIAL CONDITION OF PROGRAM HERE ABSOLUTELY. THANK YU THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES CONGRATULATIONS I LOOK FORWARD. TO MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES MAKER YOU. WELL LET ME ADD MY CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU TO YOUR APPOINTMENTS AND THANK YOU ARE YOU HOLDING MY OFFICE EARLIER. TODAY AND IT WAS A VERY VERY INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION AND I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT. AND YOUR PASSION FOR DOING THIS VERY VERY DIFFICULT JOB AND GIVING PEOPLE HOPEFULLY ANOTHER CHANCE IF THEY DESERVE IT AND I KNOW YOU TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. WE DID HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING -- FRAMEWORK BECAUSE THAT SHE REACHED RECENTLY HAVE THE TRAINING FOR A AND THERE WAS A MENTION TO YOU THEM THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS -- AND ACTUALLY HOW IT IS -- IT IS USED IN THE HEARING PROCESS THE LA A WILL RAISE SOME ISSUES ABOUT. THE FUNDING OF THAT BASED ON THEM NOT HAVING THAT MUCH INFORMATION YOU CERTAINLY DID IN OUR CONVERSATION SO. I HEARING A WITH ALSO A MOMENT HERE I THINK I'LL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR ME HOW IT'S APPLIED. THE IT'S A START MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY THINK OF THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING TOOL I THINK OF AS ALGORITHM AS FAR AS HAVING US DETERMINE IF GRANT WITH THE REDEPLOYMENT GRANT THE INMATE. OR WE'RE GOING TO KEEP HIM IN PRISON. IT'S NOT LIKE THE A SIMPLY AS A TOOL TO HELP THE DEPUTY COMMISSION COMMISSIONER CALLEGARI. TO COME TO A CONCLUSION AS FAR AS WATER RISK FACTORS AND WHAT ARE THE AT THE ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON NOT SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT THE LIFE. STATIC BUT ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON WHEN THE RISK TO THIS PARTICULAR INMATE. AND TO FOCUS THE HEARING UPON TO FIFTY THAT AND NOT THE ACTUAL BY CRIME ITSELF BUT FOCUSED ONE OF INTERCHANGE THEY HAVE TO DEFENDER ACTUALLY CHANGED. SO WE END AND SOLD THE TOOL THAT WE USE HAS -- NUMEROUS DOMAINS AND IN EACH ONE OF THOSE BILLS DOMAIN WEEK THOSE TO ME AS WE GO THROUGH. EACH ONE AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT RISK FOR RE OFFENSE BASED ON RESEARCH. AND SO WE GO THROUGH EACH DOMAIN AND AT THE END OF THE DOMAINS MAY SAY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE CRIMINAL HISTORY -- THIS INMATE MIGHT HAVE HAD AN EXTENSIVE CRIMINAL HISTORY WITH THEIR CRIMES BEING VERY CLOSE IN -- PROXIMITY THERE YOU KNOW ONE RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER WE MAY SAY THAT'S AGGRAVATED AND WE GO THROUGH THE DOMAINS AND THEN BASED ON THAT INFORMATION. THEN WE WE WE KNOW OKAY AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIS LIFE THIS IS WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIM. WERE WERE NOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER -- HAS THERE BEEN CHANGE AND WE REALLY FOCUS ON THE CHANGE WE STILL HAVE DISCRETION. ON IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THIS CHECK SYSTEM IMMUNE YOU KNOW NUMBERS AND THEN THIS EQUALS THAT IT IS FOCUSED ON THESE ARE THE HIGHEST RISK FACTORS FOR THIS INMATE AND HAS HE RESOLVED THEM. AND IF HE HAS HE WE'VE BEEN MAKE SOME DETERMINATIONS BASED ON SOME CONVERSATION EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD THINGS THAT WE PREVIEWED -- ON WHETHER OR NOT WE THINK HE IS SUITABLE FOR PAROLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. I THINK YOU ARE I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BUT AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS SANDRA. IMPRESSIVE RESUMES THAT YOU BOTH BRING TO US THANKS AGAIN. YOU CENTER. THANK YOU SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO ADD MY CONGRATULATIONS TO BOTH OF YOU IN. PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THINK AUSTER WITH MR SHARIF WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. LITTLE BIT THE THE CHALLENGE OF CONDUCTING A PAROLE HEARING WHEN THERE ARE. VICTIMS ARE FAMILY MEMBERS OF VICTIMS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCESS. YOU SHARED WITH ME A LITTLE BIT HOW YOU APPROACH -- CREATING A FOUNDATION IN A CONTEXT IN IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE THAT WITH US HOW YOU. DO THAT BALANCING ACT -- TO AFFORD RESPECT TO VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES ABSOLUTELY AT THE ONSET OF A HEARING HI ME WITH THE VICTIMS WHAT THE VICTIMS OF THE CAN. AND LET THEM KNOW NUMBER ONE THE FORMAT OF THE HEARING. AND ALSO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COULD BE A GRANT. IF IT IS THE GRANT THEY HAVE THEIR FORTY OPPORTUNITY TO NOT COME BACK INSIDE THE ROOM. A BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE UPSET AND I ACTUALLY WE LIVE THE TRAUMA ONCE AGAIN. ALSO THE LET THEM KNOW THE LAW. AS FAR AS WHAT OF OUR STANDARDS IN WHAT WE LOOKING AS FAR AS WITHIN THE CITY MAY SHOULD BE FOUND SUITABLE FOR PAROLE. IF YOU'RE SHEET METAL STANDARDS I HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW IN PRACTICE PERSON WITH AN AYE THIS PERSON IS SO I WANT TO SET THE FRAME WHAT ARE FRAMEWORK UP. SO THAT THE VICTIMS OR THE VICTIMS THAT CAN UNDERSTAND NUMBER ONE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHY ARE WE DOING IT AND NOT TO BE SORT BY SIDE SO TO SPEAK. BUT I WANT THEM TO BE NUMBER ONE FEEL COMFORTABLE IN A ROOM AND IT WILL ALSO BE BE HEARD. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- MISS MINOR WE DISCUSS SOME. MY QUESTION WENT TO DIFFERENT PRISONS HAVING DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AVAILABLE FROM. MAYBE A LOT OF PROGRAMS TO MAYBE NOT SO MANY AND I FOUND YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION IF IF YOU COULD SHARE. WHAT ROLE YOU THINK THAT PLAYS AND HOW THAT AFFECTS WERE NOT? WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR DURING A PAROLE HEARING? AND SO I I'VE BEEN PROGRAMMING IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT SOMETIMES PROGRAMMING IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND THERE ARE MEN AND WOMEN WHO REALLY TAKE THE INITIATIVE. TO IDENTIFY WHAT SEEMS NEEDED TO CHANGE AND THE DO SELF STUDY THEY GO TO THE LIBRARY THEY REALLY -- GET INTO INFORMATION THAT REALLY ASSIST THEM IN IN IN THEIR CHANGING SO THEY MAY NOT BE IN A FORMALIZED PROGRAM THEY MAY START A PROGRAM. ON THERE'S IN BUILDING -- PROGRAMS THAT INMATES START IN WHICH THEY MAY NOT BE A AVAILABLE BUT THEY KNOW THE TWELVE STEPS AND THEY KNOW HOW TO WORK -- SO THEY GET TOGETHER ON THEIR OWN AND THEY START TO TO WORK THOSE STEPS SO THAT THEY CAN WORK ON THEIR RECOVERY AND SO SOMETIMES WHEN PROGRAMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE -- THEY TAKE THE INITIATIVE -- TO FIND THINGS THAT WILL ASSIST THEM OR EVEN GET A OTHER DOCUMENTS FROM OR YOU KNOW SOME OF THE LESSONS FROM. PROGRAMS THAT. OF OTHER OFFENDERS ARI AND HAND pTO THAT PROGRAM INFORMATION TO CHECK TO WORK ON THEIR CHANGE AND SO SOMETIMES. WE WE WOULD REALLY LIKE. A LOT OF THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS MORE BUT WHEN THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS AVAILABLE. AND MANY OF THE INMATES HAVE FOUND WAYS -- TO REALLY WORK ON THEIR CHANGE THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU'D ALSO POINTED OUT THAT. JUST CHECKING BOXES OF HAVING TAKEN A PROGRAM DOESN'T NECESSARILY SATISFY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF THIS PERSON REALLY MANIFEST REFORM AND CHANGE. SO CERTAINLY WE CAN SEE WE OWE THE INMATES COME IN AND TELL US THEY'VE CHANGED AND THEN WE CAN LOOK AT THE RECORD WE CAN LOOK AT INFORMATION IN THERE SEE FILE AND AND SEE THAT. THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEIR BEHAVIOR HASN'T CHANGED BECAUSE THERE MAY BE RULE VIOLATION REPORTS THAT TELL US THAT. THEY MAY SAY THAT -- THEY'VE YOU KNOW REALLY TRIED IN SCHOOL BUT THE TEACHER MAY PROVIDE A DOCUMENT THAT SAID THAT HE DOESN'T PARTICIPATE IN IN HIS EDUCATION OUR SO THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE PARTICIPATING THAT THEY ARE. CHANGING AND IF THERE ARE CHANGES REAL -- MANY OF THE MEN THAT ARE CHANGING DO A LOT OF SERVICE THEY GIVE BACK TO OTHER INMATES -- MEN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN WOMEN THAT MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN OF SERVICE ARE NOW -- IN PRISONS AS GOAL CODES THE MATTER THAT THAT'S IN MAKES THAT ARE HELPING OTHER INMATES THAT ARE ILL SOME OF MARKET HOSPICE PROGRAM SOME OF MARK PUSHERS WHERE THEY PUSH THE OTHER INMATES THAT ARE IN WHEELCHAIRS AND SO. WHEN YOU SEE THOSE CRIME OWES YOU SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME CHANGE -- AND THAT MAYBE THE IN AND THAT THE CHANGE THAT YOU'RE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IS REAL. ME WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR BOTHA. MANIFEST A GREAT DEDICATION TO YOUR WORK IN A THOROUGHNESS AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT. YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING. LET ME ASK AND I WANNA -- THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE I THINK IN PASSED RULES COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON THIS I KNOW WE'VE. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO SEE YOU BEFORE. MISS WATER -- HI THIS IS INCREDIBLY HARD WORK -- I THINK AND AND THAT HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AGAIN -- IN YOUR TIME BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY I HAD A CAREER AT CDC ARE AND NOW YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS A NUMBER OF YEARS -- THE IN TERMS OF ASSESSMENT OF OUR AND IN THE END MY COLLEAGUES HAVE GOTTEN TO IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMS AND READING THIS. DO YOU SEE -- RECOMMENDATIONS THAT SHOULD BE MADE TO CDC ARE AS IT RELATES -- TO ANY OTHER ISSUE -- AND I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO BE PUT IN YOUR WAY BUT IN TERMS OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THE THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO TRY TO GET INMATES READY THAT MAY BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THAT YOU KNOW SCHOOL EDUCATION. I'M TRYING TO FIND -- A AWAY TO SEE IF THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AND YOU GET TO BE AT THE END OF THE SYSTEM BUT YOU'VE BEEN IN TERMS OF PEOPLE READY FOR CONSIDERATION AND GRANTED PAROLE BUT YOU'VE ALSO BEEN IN THIS IN THE INSTITUTION. SO. ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. I THINK THAT. REALLY SEEING. ADDITIONAL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TERM. OF A BIGGER NUMBER OF INMATES WOULD BE HELPFUL -- I THINK THE TYPE OF PROGRAMMING -- REALLY FOCUSING -- OR OR MAYBE EVEN ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING THAT BETTER IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAMMING WOULD BE HELPFUL -- MANY TIMES WE GO TO FACILITIES AND AND THEY'RE REALLY REGION PROGRAMS AND THEN WE GO TO PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES IS ARE NOT BETTER NOT SO REGION PROGRAMS I'D LIKE TO SEE ALL THE FACILITIES BE RICH IN PROGRAM -- SO THAT WE CAN REALLY START TO SEE MORE OFFENDER CHANGE BECAUSE THESE OFFENDERS ARE GONNA MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE BACK IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO I HAD CAN YOU HAZARD. A GUESS AS TO WHY SUMMER RICH IN PROGRAMS AND OTHERS ARE NOT. YEAH I I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT I'M NOT SURE I MEAN YOU THINK ABOUT A PLACE LIKE SAN QUENTIN I THANK WOULDN'T HAS A LOT OF VOLUNTEERS. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THAT AREA THAT GIVE A LOT OF TIME TO THAT PERSON AND AND THEY'RE ENGAGED IN -- HE IN -- SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ARE -- THAT WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT ARE PROVIDED BY THE VOLUNTEERS -- AND SO. I'M NOT SURE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO WHY BUT I DO KNOW THAT -- WHEN YOU GO TO PROBE WHEN YOU GO? TO FACILITIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF OFFENDER PROGRAMMING. THE HEARINGS ARE ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THEY'RE THEY'RE TALKING CHANGE IT EVERYBODY SEEMS TO REALLY EMBRACE CHANGE -- AND EVEN THE OFFICERS YOU KNOW EVEN THE OFFICERS HAVE A DIFFERENT -- EVEN IT WAY OF INTERACTING AND SO I THINK IF WE COULD JUST INFUSE THIS THANK THE SYSTEM WITH PROGRAMS THAT BE GREAT. SO LET ME DIRECT -- MY COMMENT HERE TO ACTUALLY STAFF OF THE RULES COMMITTEE AND THOSE WHO HELP US PREPARE. QUESTIONS -- FOR APPOINTEES WHEN WE GET TO THE CDC OUR APPOINTMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATOR SECRETARIES ETCETERA THAT'S A QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK WHY SOME PROGRAM SEEM TO BE. A RICHER AND IN TERMS OF VARIOUS SERVICES AND PROGRAMS I APPRECIATE. YOUR HELPING US OUT WITH THIS FOR SOME OF US HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOT ALIVE I I MEAN THE EXPERTISE IS RIGHT OUT THERE -- AS I LOOK AT GOVERNOR'S -- STAFF WHO HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO FILL THESE APPOINTMENTS. THEY'RE NOT EASY APPOINTMENTS TO FILL TO FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF PERSON WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF DEMEANOR WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF SKILLS. AND SO I THINK MY COLLEAGUES AND I CONTINUALLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO IMPROVE UPON THE LARGEST PRISON SYSTEM IN THE WORLD AND TO GET IT RIGHT AND YOUR KEY PIECE OF THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU PROVIDE US IN FEEDBACK? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THERE I MEAN OTHER THAN I THINK SENATOR BATES WHO HAS TRAINING IN SOCIAL WORK AND OF COURSE OUR MEDIATOR DOWN THERE AND I HAVE AN ATTORNEY TO ATTORNEYS. MAYBE I'M THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT THE EXPERIENCE STICK TO GAUGE THIS BUT I THINK WE'RE TRYIN TO LOOK AT THE SYSTEM FROM EVERY PIECE. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- MR SHREVE I WOULD ASK YOU I YOU'RE RELATIVELY NEW BUT NOT REALLY. WHAT IS THE MOST I'D? I GUESS -- SURPRISING THING YOU HAVE LEARNED AND YOUR TIME I MEAN YOU WERE -- IT A DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AND NOW. THIS APPOINTMENT YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR AT LEAST A YEAR TWO YEARS. THE COMMISSION FOR ABOUT A YEAR A FEW MONTHS AND A COMMISSIONER FOR SIX MONTHS OKAY SO COUPLE YEARS. ANOTHER TO ENOUGH TO GAUGE WHAT YOU'RE MOST SURPRISED AT IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH VERSUS WHAT YOU THOUGHT. IN JUST A FOLLOW UP ALSO ARE WITHIN ME COUNSEL FOR CLOSE TO FIFTEEN YEARS AS WELL. AND SO I KINDA UNDERSTAND FROM ALL SIDES OF THE OF THE TABLE -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME WAS THE THE SCHEDULE GRUELING SCHEDULE. AND BEING [inaudible] YOU'RE CONSTANTLY. AT WORK SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AND THE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHILD IS AT THE JOB FOR YOU BUT IF YOU ENJOY HELPING OTHERS AND BEING OF SERVICE. THIS IS THIS IS THE RIGHT JOB FOR YOU AND I'M A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT. YEAH THAT DOES IS I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT IF I GOT EVERYTHING I DO I CHALLENGE MYSELF IN HIS JOB IS A HUGE CHALLENGE. BY. BECAUSE TIMES ETCETERA MONEY IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. THIS JOB IS NOT ABOUT ME. THE SHOP ABOUT HELPING OTHERS IN SO ALTHOUGH THIS IS A VERY GRUELING JOB THE VERY REWARDING JOB AS WELL. WHAT I'M GONNA COME HOME ON FRIDAY EVENINGS I'M EXHAUSTED FROM STILL SATISFIED VOTE SATISFIED IN ENOUGH JUST TO GET ME GOING AGAIN FOR THE FOLLOWING WEEK? BECAUSE WE ARE HELPING OTHERS WE HELPING OTHERS IN SO THAT'S WHY I ENJOY THIS JOB. AND I I APPRECIATE I BECAUSE CLEARLY YOU YOU MUST ENJOY THE JOB IT ISN'T JUST THE PAY BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE YOU GET I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR MINIMUM WAGES -- GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO ME -- I IS SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT AND THE PASSION IN TERMS OF TRAINING I ASKED THIS LAST TIME -- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS -- ADEQUATE TRAINING PROVIDED AS A RELATED TO THE DIVERSITY OF THE INMATESI INCLUDING TRANS GENDER. A GENDER NON CONFORMING -- OTHERS DO YOU HAVE A DID YOU GET -- TRAINING -- WE A LOT OF TRAINING WE HAVE TRAIN AS IT BECAME MISSION AND COMMISSIONER. I SPOKE WITH STAFF ATTORNEY FOR AT LEAST THREE HOURS JEFF ON TRANSGENDER ISSUES ALL ALONE. AND WE ALSO HAD DIFFERENT TWENTY A FEW MONTHS AGO AND CHANGES IN ANY ISSUES AS WELL AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF TRAINING AREA A LOT. AND AN IMPLICIT BIAS IS INCLUDED ABSOLUTELY OKAY ABSOLUTELY IN TERMS OF THE TRAINING YOU GET REGULARLY. AND DO YOU HAVE I DON'T KNOW GIVEN IT HAVE YOU HAD EXPERINCES WITH TRANS GENDER GENDER NON CONFORMING. THE LEAD AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY I REPRESENTED -- A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS ACCUSED OF MURDER. AND UP ON ANOTHER TRANSGENDER WOMAN. AND THAT WAS MY FIRST ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF THE O. TRAIN GINGER -- COMMUNITY AND SO I HAVE TO BE EDUCATED BY MY CLIENT. ABOUT THE CHANGE IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE I WAS SO FAR REMOVED AND SO I WAS ADDITIONALLY -- TRAINED WHEN I CAME TO THE BOARD BECAUSE THEY WERE O MUCH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NON BINARY THERE'S SO MANY ISSUES I HAD NO IDEA HOW. FIT SO WE HAD A LOT OF EXTRA TRAINING. MR SURE IF I'M A MEMBER OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND TRUST ME YOU ARE NOT ALONE -- WE'RE LEARNING EVERY DAY AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT YOU KNOW OUR OUR PRISON SYSTEM IS OVERWHELMED WITH NEEDS AND ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED FACILITIES NEED OUR RESOURCES -- THE PROGRAMS AND I IS IT IS HARD TO KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGING WORLD. AND SO -- WE HAVE HEARD CONCERNS FROM THE COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE% WHO HAVE COME OUT OF PRISON. IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES AND NEEDS WITHIN AND DOT YOU WILL SEE PIECES OF LEGISLATION COME FORWARD THEY TRY TO ADDRESS ISSUES AROUND HOUSING AND SAFETY AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WERE I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO THERE SO -- ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD IN TERMS OF ANY CASE IT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ANY EITHER VIEW ACTION IS MINOR BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN THERE QUITE AWHILE -- OF GENDER NON CONFORMING OR OR POPULATION OR COMMUNITY THAT FEELS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN TARGETED FOR ANY REASON WITHIN THE SYSTEM. HAS ANY OF THAT KIND OF MADE ITS WAY. INTO THE INTO THE CASES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS YOUR CONSIDERING. THIS IS A THE LAST FOLLOW UP I DID HAVE A A CASE WHERE. THE INMATE WITH THE TRANSITION -- ONE IN. AND I HAVE TO REMIND IN MAY COUNCIL. TO CONSERVE OUR PROPER PRONOUN. BECAUSE THE VALUE ME COUNSEL KEPT SAYING HE HE AT THE OFFICE OF THE HEARING I MADE SURE. I HAS HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE REFERRED. TO AND WHAT WHAT NAME BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY CHANGE YOUR NAME AS WELL AND SO I KNOWLEDGE OR CDC NAME BUT THEY'RE ON A RECORD I ONLY CALLED HER.

WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR? YOUR COMMENTS I'M GOING TO ASK -- DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND ON THAT MISS BONNER I'M SORRY I DIDN'T. SO I I HAVE CONDUCTED -- COUPLED HEARINGS ON TRANSGENDER FEMALES AND WHAT I WHAT I HAVE -- BUT A IT IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE WHEN I RAN INTO WAS REALLY HAVING. TO TAKE A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT THE RULE VIOLATION REPORTS -- THAT ALONG THE PRISON IN THE DATE THE TIME IN WHICH THE INMATE WAS IN PRISON -- AND REALLY WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT THE THERE WAS A A POINT IN TIME WHERE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE VICTIMIZATION THAN. VIOLENCE -- ON THE BEHALF OF THE INMATE AND SO I HAD TO REALLY TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT WHY DID THIS HAPPEN IN WAS. THIS PERSON WAS HE BEING PICKED WHICH SHE BEING VICTIMIZED AND AND WE DETERMINE JUST BASED ON READING THE RULE VIOLATION REPORTS THAT. IT WAS NOT THAT THIS PERSON WAS A VIOLENT. PERSON IT WAS THAT THE PERSON WAS BEING VICTIMIZED IN THE WAY THAT INFORMATION WAS BEING PROVIDED KIND OF DIDN'T. DIDN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY UNTIL WE DID A DEEPER DIVE AND SO I I DO KNOW THAT WE TAKE A IN PARTICULAR TAKE. A BIT OF CARE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT BEHAVIOR AND WHAT HAPPENED IN WHICH IS NOT LOOKING AT ALL THIS IS A RULE VIOLATION THEREFORE YOU ARE DANGEROUS FOR LOOKING AT WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON WERE YOU BEING VICTIMIZED IN WAS THIS RIGHT AT THE TIME OF YOUR TRANSITION. YOUR TRANSITION AND CHANGE -- AND AND WE REALLY ARE MINDFUL OF OF TAKING THAT EXTRA TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND THEN NOT.
