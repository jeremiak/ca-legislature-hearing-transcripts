00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE JUST IMPROVED BY ONE MILE PER

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:31.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
BE?

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:31.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
?

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISCOUNTED IN ALL THIS AND I

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SHOULD ALSO SAY THAT.

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:39.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHEN. SECRETARY OF INTERIOR

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COME VISIT. AN INTERESTING WAY

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE DAY THE SECRETARY OF

PERSON.

00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:12.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHY IT WAS DIFFERENT WHY HE HAD

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO DO THIS AND WAS RELENTLESS IN

SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES PROJECTS.

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF

L. P. A FORCE IN ACTED. IT

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:50.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REALLY SET UP A PROCESS FOR

LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL FISHERIES.

00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:56.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT COST IN THE FIRST THREE

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:57.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO SIX THAT WERE DONE SOMEWHERE

00:17:58.043 --> 00:17:59.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF. NINE

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:01.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A MILLION

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:02.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOLLARS AND THAT IS THE REASON

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:05.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
THERE ARE THIRTY THAT ARE ON
DON.

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND SO WE IN JANUARY AT OUR

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:10.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MEETINGS. BUNDLED THOSE

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:12.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REMAINING THIRTY TO GATHER AND

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPROPRIATED MONEY TO TRY TO DO

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:15.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE FIRST STEPS TO MAKE SURE

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THOSE

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROCESSES AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:22.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ACTUALLY. DONE.

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:22.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
JUST SO YOU KNOW. ARE KEY

CAPACITY OF SEA GRASS.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOCUMENT THE SCIENCE IN RELATION

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND PRETTY SHORTLY THEREAFTER.

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I THINK THE

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATE ESTABLISHED THE FIRST

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MASTER PLAN. FOR GOVERNANCE

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:32.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WITHIN THAT. AND WHAT'S

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:33.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS OUR

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DEPARTMENT WITH COMMISSION

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:37.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEADERSHIP ARE VARIOUS PARTNERS

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:39.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN TRIBES. ARE UNENDING THAT

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
MASTER PLAN.

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND HERE'S WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:46.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO WE SPENT ABOUT TWO YEARS

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:46.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THROUGH THAT COLLABORATIVE

00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIALOGUE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:51.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMISSION'S PUBLIC PROCESS.

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:52.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I THINK THIS WILL BE A FROM

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE COMMISSION IN JUNE.

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:55.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND THAT'LL SET US UP FOR

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IMPLEMENTATION WE'VE HAD

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

COMMUNITIES FISHING COMMUNITIES.

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:04.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IT WILL LAY OUT A FRAMEWORK

00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:05.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO ASSESS

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:07.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OUR STATE MANAGED OCEAN

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
FISHERIES.

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:10.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THEN GET ABOUT THE BUSINESS

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF DESIGNING THE SUSTAINABILITY

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PLANS FOR THOSE FISHERIES.

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:15.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT IT DOES SOMETHING NEW.

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE EXISTING LAW REALLY

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:19.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EMPHASIZES FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:21.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PLANS WHICH CAN BE A LENGTHY

00:22:21.206 --> 00:22:22.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROCESS THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:23.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO GET

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:27.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN OR SO

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:27.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FISHERIES UNDER THAT PLANNING

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
EFFORT.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS AMENDMENT CREATES A NEW I

00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:32.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK INNOVATIVE ASPECT WHERE.

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:34.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE MAY BE SOME FISHERIES WE

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:35.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAN DO ENHANCE STATUS REPORTS

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:37.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ABOUT.

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:39.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO THE ANALYSIS ANALYSIS FASTER

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:41.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDERSTAND THEIR STATUS FASTER

00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:43.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THEN THAT'LL BECOME A PIVOT

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:45.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT DECIDE IF YOU NEED A FULL

FISHERIES MANAGEMENT PLAN OR

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOME MORE ABBREVIATED LIGHTER

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
VERSION BASED ON STAKEHOLDER

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:52.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENGAGEMENT IN THE SCIENCE. SO

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH THE SOME MEN THAT WE EXPECT

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:56.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT BY EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND

00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:58.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NINETEEN BUT A YEAR LATER WE'LL

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BE ABLE TO HAVE DONE ABOUT

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIRTY SIX OF THOSE IN HAND

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:03.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATUS REPORTS FOR STATE BASS

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:05.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FISHERIES WHICH CURRENTLY DON'T

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:07.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE ANY ANALYSIS AROUND THEM.

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:09.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR THEIR LONG TERM MANAGEMENT.

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:11.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THAT'S THE FIRST CATEGORY.

00:23:11.189 --> 00:23:12.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE SECOND TOPIC YES ME TALK

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:15.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ABOUT. ALL THINGS WHALES.

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS TAKES A MOMENT TO PAUSE.

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:21.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND A KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE A

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:23.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
LOT OF ENGAGE.

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPONENTS OF OUR CITIZENRY ON

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:26.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THIS TOPIC.

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:28.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE FLEET IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:30.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OUR CONSERVATION COMMUNITY.

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:31.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINK THERE'S A SINGLE MOST

00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:35.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IMPORTANT SHARED VALUES.

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:36.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOBODY WANTS TO UNTANGLE AWAY

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:38.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ALL.

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:40.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I THINK THAT RUNS ACROSS THE

00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:41.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
SIGHT SEEING THE

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ENVIRONMENTALISTS THEN YEAH

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:45.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
INDUSTRY COMMUNITIES.

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:46.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:49.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE ARE UNDER ACTIVE LITIGATION.

00:23:49.728 --> 00:23:51.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN SUED IN

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
FEDERAL COURT.

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:53.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BY THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:56.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DIVERSITY. AND MOST RECENTLY.

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:58.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF

00:23:58.503 --> 00:23:59.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS HAVE

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:01.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MOVED INTERVENE IN THAT FEDERAL

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
LITIGATION.

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:05.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SO THAT'S HAPPENING.

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:07.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN ONE'S FEAR. BUT AT THE SAME

00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:09.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TIME THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:11.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNDER WAY. TO GET AHEAD OF THIS

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:13.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROBLEM FOR A COUPLE EARS.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THROUGH OUR DUNGEON IS CRAP WORK

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GROUP. THERE IS A STRUCTURE.

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:21.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I BELIEVE THERE IS A SET OF

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:23.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SHARED VALUES AND OBJECTIVES

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED BETWEEN

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:27.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING INDUSTRY.

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:28.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THOSE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:30.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
TRANSPARENCY.

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROCESS.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
INFORMATION SHARING.

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:37.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ELECTRONIC MONITORING.

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:38.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AROUND THIS ISSUE PERHAPS GEAR

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:40.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
MARKING.

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:43.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THEN. WHAT IS CALLED RAMP A

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RISK ASSESSMENT MITIGATION

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:46.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROGRAM? WHICH IS A LAY PERSON

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:50.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
IN MY MIND I PACKAGE IT THIS
WAY.

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:53.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POSSIBLY AS AN ANALOGY SOMETHING

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:57.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LIKE A GREEN YELLOW RED. RISK

ESCALATION DIAGRAM.

00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:01.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND IF WE CAN FOSTER AN

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:02.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ATMOSPHERE WHERE INDUSTRY AND

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:05.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STAKE HOLDERS ARE ENGAGED IN

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:07.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THAT TYPE OF PROCESS.

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:09.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE SEGUE BETWEEN COLORS IS

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:11.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEFINED BY OBJECTIVE SCIENTIFIC

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
METRICS.

00:25:13.078 --> 00:25:15.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND AS YOU MOVE UP YOUR SLIDE

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
YOUR YOUR RISK METER.

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:20.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KING ABOUT COLLABORATIVE ACTIONS

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TO REDUCE THE RISK AND

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:23.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EVENTUALLY PERHAPS YOU'RE

00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINKING ABOUT RESTRICTIVE

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:29.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTIONS. THAT'S ON TOPIC WELL.

00:25:29.594 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENGAGED IN THIS WORKING GROUP

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:33.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S REFLECTED I THINK IN YOUR

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
OMNIBUS BILL.

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:36.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WHAT'S NEXT I THINK IS FOR

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:38.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE PARTIES TO. CONTINUE THAT

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:40.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONVERSATION SEE IF WE CAN'T

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PRODUCE AN OUTCOME. THAT WILL

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
REDUCE THE RISK OF.

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:45.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ENTANGLEMENTS BY WAILING OR

00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:46.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIXED GEAR FISHERIES IN STATE

WATERS.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S B. TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN IS

00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:51.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOUR LEADERSHIP TO THINK ABOUT A

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:53.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PART OF THIS CHALLENGE AND

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT'S GEAR LEFT IN WATER

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ABANDON OR DERELICT.

00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:59.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:25:59.457 --> 00:25:59.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEADERSHIP IN AUTHORING THAT

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:01.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BILL.

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE IN THE

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CURRENT OMNIBUS YOU'VE TRIED TO

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:06.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FINE TUNE. THINGS TO HELP

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:06.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IMPLEMENTATION BE MORE

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUCCESSFUL. THE DEPARTMENTS I

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:11.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK ABLE TO COME TO YOU AND

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:12.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TALK ABOUT A FEW FURTHER

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
REFINEMENTS.

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:16.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE THINK WE'RE CLOSE ON THAT

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:17.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:19.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONVERSATION. AND WERE ALSO VERY

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:20.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WILLING TO ADOPT YOUR

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:23.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INSTRUCTION THAT WITHIN ABOUT A

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:25.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEAR FROM NOW WE'VE GONE AHEAD

00:26:25.383 --> 00:26:25.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND DONE THE IMPLEMENTING RULE

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MAKING. TO MAKE IT A REALLY

00:26:28.386 --> 00:26:29.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:34.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:36.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONVERSATION. AND A LOT OF GREAT

00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:38.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
CONCERN AROUND WELL
ENTANGLEMENT.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT I'M OF THE VIEW WITH THE

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:40.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DEPARTMENT IN THE MIDDLE

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FACILITATING THIS CONVERSATION I

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:44.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK WE CAN GET ALL THE MAJOR

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STAKE HOLDERS TO A COMMON

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:47.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUTCOME. I'M HOPEFUL FOR THAT.

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:48.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LET ME RUN THROUGH AN UPDATE ON

00:26:48.673 --> 00:26:50.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE SALMON SARDINE INTERACTION

00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:53.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FISHERIES THE CHEST FOR.

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THERE'S GOOD AND BAD NEWS.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON THE SAME IN FRONT I'D SAY

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:58.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S A TOUCH OF GOOD NEWS BUT

00:26:58.083 --> 00:26:59.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S ALSO BAD NEWS. SO LAST

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:01.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WEEK OUR SCIENTISTS COMPLETED

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:02.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE STOCK FORECASTS FOR THE

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SACRAMENTO IN THE KLAMATH FALLS

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:07.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHINOOK. AND THESE FORECASTS ARE

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHAT BECOME THE BASIS TO

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DETERMINE THE TWO THOUSAND

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:12.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHTEEN FISHING SEASONS. SO THE

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FORECAST FOR THE SALMON FALL RUN

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:17.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO LAST
YEAR.

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT FORECASTS THESE ARE MODELS

00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:20.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THATTAKE A SKATE MEN IN NUMBERS

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND PROJECT WHAT WE THINK WE'LL

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:24.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEE. AND THEN THAT GUIDES WHAT

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:26.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE ARE ABLE TO ALLOCATE FOR

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:28.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
CATCHING HARVEST.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:29.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO IN THE SACRAMENTO IT'S A

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:30.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROJECTION OF TWO HUNDRED AND

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:33.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIRTY THOUSAND ADULTS WHICH IS

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:34.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALMOST IDENTICAL TO LAST YEAR.

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:37.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN THE KLAMATH FALL RUN STOCK

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THERE

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:39.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MIGHT BE SOME GOOD NEWS.

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NUMBER IT IS RELATIVE BECAUSE

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:43.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT WAS SO ABYSMAL THE PRIOR

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:44.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SEASON.

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:46.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT IS MUCH IMPROVED WITH A

00:27:46.197 --> 00:27:47.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FORECAST OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:49.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND SIXTY THOUSAND CHINOOK IN

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:51.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WIN LAST

00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:53.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
YEAR WAS ABOUT FIFTY FOUR

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THOUSAND. ADULTS SO THAT'S A

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:57.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MARKET INCREASE I DO THINK THAT

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:59.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
SOME GOOD NEWS.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HERE'S THE LESS GOOD NEWS. IF

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU THINK ABOUT IT BASED ON

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:03.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE CRITERIA AS THEY ARE

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:04.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
EXPRESSED IN THE FEDERAL

00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:06.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MANAGEMENT PLANS. IT MAY BE THE

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CASE THAT BOTH OF THESE TARGETS

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
STOCKS.

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:11.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU MAY QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:13.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEFINITION OF OVER FISHED IN TWO

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. SO WHAT'S

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAPPENING THIS WEEK AT THE

00:28:16.094 --> 00:28:17.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PACIFIC FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:19.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COUNCIL RUNNER PARK IS THE

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEGINNING OF A DISCUSSION WHICH

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:22.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
WILL END IN.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT WAS A JUNE IN PORTLAND.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND WILL DETERMINE WHAT'S

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:29.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE FINISHED OR

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOT IN BOTH THOSE FISHERIES.

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:33.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SARDINE I WOULD SAY IS

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:35.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
CONTINUED BADNESS.

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:37.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT FOR

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOURTH YEAR IN A ROW YOU'LL SEE

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:39.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NO FISHING FOR OUR STARTING

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:41.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
FISHER.

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE REASON IS THE PROJECTED

00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SARDINE STOCK BIOMASS IS WELL

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:46.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BELOW THE SET LIMITS. FOR THIS

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:48.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FISHERY.

00:28:48.993 --> 00:28:51.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WE'RE PROJECTING THE BIO MASS

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AT FIFTY ABOUT FIFTY TWO

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOUSAND METRIC TONS. AND THE

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:56.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LIMIT IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:28:56.668 --> 00:28:58.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOUSAND METRIC TONS THAT'S HOW

00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:00.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FAR BELOW THE LIMIT WE ARE. AND

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:03.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK JUST TODAY THE FEDERAL

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:05.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COUNCIL AND THE NATIONALLY

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FISHERIES SERVICE. HAVE PUT OUT

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ADDITIONAL DATA SUGGESTING THAT.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX THIS

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:13.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STARTING FISHERY IS DECLINED BY

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:15.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
NINETY. SEVEN PERCENT.

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:17.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO SOME OF THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:20.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS COMPARING IT TO THE COLLAPSE

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:21.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF THE CANNERY ROW FISHERY.

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:23.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR VARIETY OF FACTORS AND I

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:24.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THINK THAT'S MUCH OF THE

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISCUSSION NEXT YOU KNOW WHAT

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE THE PRIME FACTORS AND WHAT

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:31.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VIRGIN ABALONE NORTH COAST HELP

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:33.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
I WOULD PUT AS ONE.

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:35.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN DECEMBER AS MANY KNOW OUR

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:36.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMISSION CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:38.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EIGHTEEN READ ABALONE SEASON

00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:39.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BASED ON A COLLAPSE.

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:41.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE COLLAPSE IS REALLY TRIGGERED

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BY I THINK THAN FAVORABLE OCEAN

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:44.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONDITIONS LARGE SCALE REGIME

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SHIFT. AND BASICALLY A LOSS OF

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:48.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
ARE KILLED FARCE.

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:49.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHICH SHOWS THE LOUD LESS

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PREFERABLE VIRGINS TO TAKE OVER

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:53.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE LANDSCAPE BIRBAL NOTABLY.

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:57.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DO THE COMMISSION IS FORCING THE

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:59.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEPARTMENT APPROPRIATELY TO DO.

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:01.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS UPDATE THE ABALONE READ EYE

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:02.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BELOW THE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLAN. IT'S OUTDATED WE NEED TO

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:07.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GET IT UPDATED WITH NEW SCIENCE

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:08.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:08.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:11.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT IT'S VERY LIKELY IF NOT

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:12.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CERTAIN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
LIMITED URCHIN FISHERY

00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:16.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
OPPORTUNITIES STILL.

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:18.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK ON THE UPSIDE I WOULD

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:19.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE GOT CRAB

00:30:19.617 --> 00:30:21.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OPEN.

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:22.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE GOT IT OPEN IN THE HOLIDAYS.

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:26.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND WE SEEM TO HAVE AVOIDED A

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:26.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SIMILAR DIM DRAMATIC ACID

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:27.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAD A COUPLE

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:29.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEARS PRIOR. EVEN THOUGH IT'S

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:30.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT OUR OCEAN

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:32.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROTECTION COUNCIL KEEP POSTING

00:30:32.864 --> 00:30:35.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE SCIENTIFIC WORKSHOPS ONE

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:35.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE NEXT

00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:36.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
MONTH.

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:38.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HE. FORCING US TO LOOK AT THIS

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:40.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUESTION OF DEMO GAS IT AND HOW

00:30:40.838 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE MANAGE IT IN FUTURE CYCLES.

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:44.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AQUA CULTURE PROGRAMMATIC

00:30:44.842 --> 00:30:46.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT.

00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:48.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A MOUTHFUL. NOT MANY OF THE ROOM

00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:50.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROBABLY UNDERSTAND OR TALKING

00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:51.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ABOUT I THINK YOU DO.

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:52.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I DON'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD TAKE

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TEN PLUS YEARS FOR AN AGENCY TO

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:56.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMPLETE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:58.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE

THIS CALENDAR YEAR. THAT'LL BE A

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:10.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HUGE SHIFT. NEEDS TO GET DONE IT

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:11.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SHOULD'VE BEEN DONE A LONG TIME

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BIG ONE. I THINK WHAT'S

DOVETAIL IN WITH THEM I MAY.

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INITIATIVE AND HOW WE CAN FOCUS

FISHERIES WHAT'S IMPORTANT THERE

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:25.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

CAN HELP OUR COMMUNITIES BE MORE

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:29.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RESILIENT IN THE FUTURE SO IF

ITS INFRASTRUCTURE IF IT'S ICE

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF IT'S A HOIST LIKE HOW CAN WE

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK THROUGH WHAT FISHERIES

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:35.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MIGHT BE THERE? IN TWENTY YEARS

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:37.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

AT THE OCEAN GOES THROUGH AND SO

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THOSE

00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:41.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COMMUNITIES ARE RESILIENT

THROUGH THOSE CYCLES. CONSISTENT

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT SOME OF THESORT OF ON THE

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:46.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GROUND ON THE BOOTS ARE THE

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:47.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROJECTS THAT. I THINK WOULD BE

HELPFUL AS WELL AS THE LARGER

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:50.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:19.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SO THERE ARE THREE KEY

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS RESULTING

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FROM OIL DRILLING WHILE LIFE

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:25.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:27.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THE FUTURE OF THE PLANET.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THEY EACH OF THESE THINGS

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:30.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WILL SUFFER IF CALIFORNIA

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CONTINUES TO ALLOW OIL

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:35.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXTRACTION. HERE. BUT ESPECIALLY

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING IS

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOUD AND IF IT IS FORCED ON THE

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:40.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
STATE BY THE CURRENT

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ADMINISTRATION AND BY THE OIL

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INDUSTRY. AND I THINK IT'S

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:45.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. THE

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:46.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADMINISTRATION IS AN ACTING

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ALONE IN THIS IT'S THE OIL

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:51.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INDUSTRY THAT'S DEMANDING THAT

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OFFSHORE OIL FEE OPENED UP.

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:55.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FIRST ABOUT WILDLIFE I THINK

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:56.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S INSTRUCTIVE TO LOOK AT THE

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:58.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REFUGIO BEACH OIL SPILL OF MAY

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:01.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF TWENTY FIFTEEN. BAT WAS AS

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:04.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OIL SPILLS GO A TINY OIL SPILL.

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWENTY ONE THOUSAND GALLONS OF

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:07.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OIL ENDED UP IN THE OCEAN OF

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GRANITE IT CAME FROM A HUNDRED

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:11.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOUSAND GALLON SPILL. FROM A

PIPELINE ON ON LAND BUT

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ULTIMATELY TWENTY ONE THOUSAND

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GALLONS ENDED UP IN THE OCEAN.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND SMALLER SPILLS ARE FAIRLY

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:21.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
COMMON. BUT.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:24.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT COVERED AN AREA OF TWENTY

BIGGEST HIT WAS TO SEE LINES

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
THERE ABOUT TWELVE DEAD

THESE NUMBERS.

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCREASE SLIGHTLY OVER THE NEXT

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:05.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SEVERAL MONTHS BUT WHAT THESE

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:08.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NUMBERS DON'T REFLECT IS THE

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:11.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WILDLIFE YOU DON'T SEE THE BIRD

ARE NOT LOCATED.

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAPPENED TO THE FISH WE DON'T

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:36.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

DON'T GET RESCUED. AND THEY WHAT

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:41.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE WON'T KNOW THE LONG TERM

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:42.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPACTS TO THE FISHERY OF THAT

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:43.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OIL SPILL FOR A LONG LONG TIME

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:44.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE FOR

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:47.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
SCIENTISTS TO STARTS TO USED AS
DIRECTED AS SOME PEOPLE

HEALTH.

01:04:51.787 --> 01:04:54.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF EVERY

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DAY POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA. IS.

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:59.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM TAILPIPE EMISSIONS AS THE

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PRODUCT OF BURNING OIL.

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN VARIOUS FORMS EITHER AS

GAS.

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:14.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THESE THESE. OF.

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:17.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THESE EMISSIONS RESULT IN. ABOUT

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NINETY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:21.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AT ANY TIME DURING THE YEAR

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEING EXPOSED TO UNHEALTHY AIR.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE'S ONLY A REALLY SMALL

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PORTION OF CALIFORNIANS THAT CAN

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAY THAT THEY HAVE CLEAN AIR

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:30.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVERY DAY. AND IF THEY NEVER

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEAVE THEIR LITTLE CLEAN AIR

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPOT. AND THEY DON'T GO TO SAN

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:35.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FRANCISCO THEY DON'T GO TO LA

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY DON'T GO TO FRESNO. THEN

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:39.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THEY THEY CAN AVOID BEING

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:40.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
EXPOSED TO DIRTY AIR BUT

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:43.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VIRTUALLY EVERY CALIFORNIAN IS

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXPOSED TO DIRTY AIR AT LEAST.

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME POINT DURING THE YEAR AND

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:47.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE

THREE POLLUTED AIR BASINS. AND

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:03.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY GET EXPOSED DOZENS OF DAYS

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:04.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EACH YEAR.

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:07.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME OF

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE HIGHEST.

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HIGHEST RATES OF LUNG DISEASE

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:29.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISEASE IS HIGHER IN HIGHLY

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POLLUTED AREAS WE KNOW FROM

SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:34.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND THIS NUMBER MAY HAVE

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INCREASED SLIGHTLY R DECREASE

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:37.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SLIGHTLY I'M I'M NOT SURE BUT AT

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE POINT. A SEVERAL YEARS AGO A

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:42.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
STUDY WAS DONE OF THE.

THIS PARTICULAR PANEL.

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:16.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO JUST A QUICK COMMENT THINKS

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:16.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
MUCH.

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:18.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OBVIOUS IS BIPARTISAN ISSUE WE

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:20.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE FIVE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIX REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS HAVE

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:24.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COME OUT AGAINST THIS PLAN.

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:26.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OTHERS OF

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:26.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:30.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEGISLATURE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:30.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:31.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CALIFORNIA.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK OBVIOUS INSTRUMENT I'M

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:37.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GLAD BIPARTISAN INDUSTRY THAT

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:40.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU REPRESENT AND A UNIFIED IN

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:42.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE APPROACHES. IT'S ABOUT

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PROTECTING LIVELIHOODS.

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:47.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:50.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT IS
STARKLY%

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:50.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
CLEAR.

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:54.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:56.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHERUB CHOIR THERE'S NO THEIR NO

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:57.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BONES ABOUT IT WHETHER YOU ARE A

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL. OUTSIDE

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT THIS

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INDUSTRY HAS NO PLACE IN THESE

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PARTICULAR WATERS ABSOLUTELY NOT

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:09.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND. II'M GLAD THAT POLITICAL

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
REALITIES.

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:13.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE ENABLING EVERYONE TO COME

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:16.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TOGETHER. AND THEN SHARE THIS

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:18.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPINION AND JOIN IN PROTECTING

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:20.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR COCINA CENTURIES. THANK YOU

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:21.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SO MUCH.

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
PLEASE MISSILES.

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I JUST WANT TO NOTE.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
YOU KNOW BEING AN

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:27.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENVIRONMENTALIST DOESN'T HAVE A

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:29.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PARTY AFFILIATION EITHER AND IF

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:30.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING IN

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIA SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REPUBLICANS CARE ABOUT THE

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:35.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENVIRONMENT. AND I THINK ONE

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:37.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REASON CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABLE

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:39.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO LEAD ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED A

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BIPARTISAN ISSUE IN THE STATE.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT ISN'T ALWAYS REFLECTED BY

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOME OF THE VOTES WE SEE. BUT

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:48.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEN IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THINK IF YOU TALK TO MOST

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:50.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALIFORNIANS YOU'RE GOING TO

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:52.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FIND THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS DO

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
NOT WANT.

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:55.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING WHETHER

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:57.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'RE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:59.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
NOTHING SO MUCH.

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:00.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MY LAST QUESTION IS HAWKINS CAN

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:01.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU BREAK OUT THAT NINETY TWO

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILLION HOW MUCH OF IT IS CEAN

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEPENDENT IN COASTAL DEPENDENT.

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:06.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DO YOU HAVE ANY BREAK DOWN ON

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:10.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THAT YEAH SO HE'S.

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:12.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FILL UP THAT. THE BUT WHAT WE

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:13.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FOUND WAS THAT OCEAN BASED

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:15.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RECREATION AND TOURISM WAS ABOUT

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:17.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TWENTY BILLION ABOUT TWENTY

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
BILLION YES.

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT'S GREAT.

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:22.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL A

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:26.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMPLETE SYSTEM. IS NOT THE

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:28.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LABOR THIS BUT JUST TO WEIGH IN

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:29.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A LITTLE BIT AND I THINK THESE

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:31.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS ARE VERY

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
IMPORTANT HAVE ACROSS
CALIFORNIA.

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:35.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PRACTICAL

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:35.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
MATTER.

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:38.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF HAVING OFFSHORE OIL LEASES

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:41.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH WITHOUT ONSHORE FACILITIES

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE MORE WE PUSH BACK ACROSS

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:45.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIA THE LESS LIKELY IT IS

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT ANYONE COULD BE INTERESTED

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THIS. STAKE IN THESE. LEASE

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SALES. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REALLY MOVES FORWARD ON THIS AND

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:54.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHERE WE ARE VULNERABLE IS WHERE

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:56.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE ARE EXISTING FACILITIES.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:57.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ON SHORE FACILITIES TO BE ABLE

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:59.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO MOVE MORE OIL IN BUT A LOT OF

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:02.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE FIELDS ARE. DEPLETED IT'S

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOESN'T IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:05.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DO MUCH OTHER THAN TRY TO EXPAND

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:08.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DRILLING. FOR THE LOUDER WE ARE

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:09.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THE MORE.

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:11.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMPREHENSIVE THE RESPONSE TO

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE FEDERAL PLAN THAN THE LESS

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:16.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LIKELY ANYONE WILL WANT TO.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REALLY ACQUIRE THOSE PLACES

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:18.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GONNA HAVE A FIGHT. SO THAT'S

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT EERY OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO TALK ABOUT IT LOT OF RALLIES

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE BEEN DONE ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:29.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE ALL WENT OUR VOICE TO THE

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:33.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EFFORT TEACHER OR TO TO CUT THE

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:34.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INTERESTED IN THIS CHANGE.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:37.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITHOUT A VERY CONSISTENT POLICY

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TOWARDS OFFSHORE DRILLING FOR

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:41.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DECADES NOW CALIFORNIA THAT

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:42.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED AND THE

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGREED WITH

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT UNTIL NOW SO IT'S REALLY

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FRUSTRATING TO SEE. THIS CHANGE

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WE JUST

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:53.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:58.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:05.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK ACROSS THE

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

SAY.

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:18.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

INTERACTIONS IN THE WILD. THINK

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:54.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE

ON THE EAGLE RIVER WATERSHED. IN

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK IT WAS AT TWO THOUSAND

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:01.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOURTEEN WE ACTUALLY SAW THE ILL

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:23.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED ANY

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:46.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THREATS TO THEM THAT THE SUBJECT

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:48.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAS BEEN COVERED MUCH BETTER

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:49.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

.

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:55.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE'VE DONE FOR A LONG TIME THE

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:57.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE STOCK

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF THE SACRAMENTO FALL RUN

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:01.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHINOOK THAT WE DEPEND ON. FOR

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:04.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOST OF THE OCEAN FISHERIES. ARE

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:06.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PRIMARILY HATCHERY STOCK. IN

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:08.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEARS AGO THERE WAS A A VERY

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:09.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ASTUTE BIOLOGIST FOR THE

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:11.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEPARTMENT OF FRANK FISHER WHO

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:13.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAID. MOST OF THE FISH SPAWNING

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GRAVEL AND CAME FROM HATCHERIES

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S BEEN TRUE FOR A LONG TIME

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:19.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:21.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT I'M AWARE OF. THAT THE

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:22.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NUMBER OF FISH SPAWNING IN

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:25.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GRAVEL WAS LESS THAN THE NUMBER

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
THAT CAME BACK TO THE
HATCHERIES.

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:29.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

OF THE BIG ISSUE. OTHER THAN

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:37.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:40.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF THE BIG ISSUE IS HAVING

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENOUGH WATER OF SUITABLE QUALITY

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:44.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

THAT WAR WE'VE. ALL COME BACK TO

ABUNDANCE OF AGE TO FISH? THAT

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:18.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SINCE AND IT NOW LOOKS AS THOUGH

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS YEAR'S SEASON. MAY BE EVEN

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:22.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MORE RESTRICTED THAN LAST YEAR'S

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:25.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BY. THE POOR PRODUCTION OF

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:27.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SACRAMENTAL FALL CHINOOK.

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:29.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE LAST TWO YEARS SHOULD

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:32.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
QUALIFY OF THE OCEAN SALMON

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FISHERY SHOULD QUALIFY FOR

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:37.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISASTER. DECLARATIONS I HOPE

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:39.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
THAT WON'T BE THE CASE THIS
YEAR.

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:41.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF WE'LL SEE HOW THAT TURNS OUT.

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:42.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:44.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I GUESS I'M HOPING THAT.

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOLLOWING THE LITTLE BIT OF

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OPPORTUNITY WILL HAVE WILL BE

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:49.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PRODUCTIVE

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:51.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAN IT'S BEEN. THE LAST FEW

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:54.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEARS. OF WE ARE A LONG LONG

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:56.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAYS FROM THE GLORY DAYS OF THE

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:59.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LATE NINETIES AND EARLY AUGHTS

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WIN OF. THE QUESTION WAS HOW

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:02.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FAST CAN YOU HANDLE FISH ON THE

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:04.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BOAT AND TAKE CARE OF THEM TO

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:06.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GET THEM CHILLED. WE WE HAVEN'T

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:09.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEEN THAT FOR QUITE AWHILE. OF.

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:11.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THREATS TO THE FUTURE OF THE

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:12.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FISHERY IN ADDITION TO THE WATER

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SITUATION AND OF COURSE IT'S

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:16.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE IN THE

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:19.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATE THAT WATER FLOWS UP HILL

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:20.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
TO MONEY. OF.

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:22.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE BELIEVE THE TWIN TUNNELS

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:24.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR SALMON

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:26.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND FOUR OTHER FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALL OF THE FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:30.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT USE THE DELTA. AND THE BAY

01:29:30.965 --> 01:29:34.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU CANNOT RESTORE AN ESTUARY BY

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:35.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIVERTING FRESH WATER FLOWS

01:29:35.603 --> 01:29:37.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AROUND IT THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:39.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ITS FUNCTIONS. AND SO WE WOULD.

01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:42.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LIKE TO SEE THAT NOT HAPPEN

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:44.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OFFSHORE DRILLING OTHER PEOPLE

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:46.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE SPOKEN MORE ELOQUENTLY

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:48.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT IT THEN I WILL. BUT IT

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:49.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD BE DISASTROUS NOT JUST FOR

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SALMON FISHERIES BUT FOR MOST

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:53.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MARINE LIFE. AND ALL THE PEOPLE.

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:55.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHO EITHER MAKE A LIVING ON THE

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:57.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OCEAN ENJOYED RECREATIONALLY OR

01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:59.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIMPLY TRAVEL TO THE COAST TO

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:02.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADMIRE THE BEAUTY OF THE OCEAN

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT?

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:04.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THESE DISASTERS HAVEN'T HAPPENED

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:07.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
YET AND CAN BE PREVENTED.

01:30:07.735 --> 01:30:10.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CLIMATE CHANGE. IS A HUGE THREAT

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:13.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON IT'S

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:14.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE SOUTHERN END OF THE RANGE.

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND WE SEE A GENERAL TREND IN

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:19.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPECIES TO MIGRATE TO THE NORTH.

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:23.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF AS CLIMATE CHANGE OCCURS. OF

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
AN.

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:27.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S GOING TO BE A MORE INTENSE

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:28.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STRUGGLE IN THE FUTURE TO

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:31.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MAINTAIN. ROBUST RUNS OF SALMON

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:33.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:36.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
FIRST OF ALL.

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:40.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE HAVE TO STOP TREATING WATER

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:42.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS THOUGH IT IS AN INFINITE AND

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:45.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FREE. RESOURCE IS IT CLEARLY IS

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:47.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NOT. WE'VE BEEN TAKING MORE

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:48.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WATER FROM THE DELTA THE THAN IT

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:50.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAS TO GIVE FOR A LONG TIME IF

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:54.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE VALUE THE DELTA. AS A LIVING

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:56.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND BOUNTIFUL YES YOU ARE.

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:58.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WE HAVE TO ONCE WE FACE THAT

01:30:58.553 --> 01:31:00.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALITY YOU HAVE TO ADAPT TO IT

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:02.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BY CHANGING THE WAY WE THINK

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:04.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
ABOUT WATER IN THE WAY WE USE
IT.

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:05.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE THING WE COULD DO THERE IS A

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:08.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
TEMPLATE.

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:09.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THAT WOULD BE THAT IS THE

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENVIRONMENTAL WATER CARCASS. AND

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:16.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEIR DOCUMENT A SUSTAINABLE

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:17.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WATER PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:19.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I THINK THAT THAT DOCUMENT

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:22.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DESERVES A GOOD HARD LOOK BY

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PEOPLE IN A POSITION TO MAKE.

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:27.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND CHANGE POLICY. THIRTY SIXTY

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:29.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

WHACK OUT OF THE FREMONT WE'RE

WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FIX IF

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:22.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S ANYTHING THE LEGISLATURE

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:24.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN DO TO HELP US AT LEAST GET

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:26.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO W. OR TO MOVE ON THE THERMAL

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIDO ISSUE. THAT WOULD BE HUGE.

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:32.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO HERE'S A HAPPY PICTURE.

01:37:32.713 --> 01:37:34.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IS UP ON THE ROGUE RIVER.

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:36.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS IS AN ORGAN SHE MAY NOT

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:37.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS BUT

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:39.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHILE THE CALIFORNIA RIVERS HAVE

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEEN SUFFERING THE ROGUES GOING

01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:42.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OFF THE HOOK. IT'S GOT THE

01:37:42.723 --> 01:37:44.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SECOND BIGGEST PRODUCTION FOR

01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:46.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTRIBUTION TO THE OCEAN AFTER

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:47.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE COLOMBIAN SNAKE RIVER IN

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:49.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THE ENTIRE

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:51.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WEST COAST. IT BEATS THE KLAMATH

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT BEATS THE SACRAMENTO BY A

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:55.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
FACTOR OF TWO.

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:57.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU ASK YOURSELF WHY ON THIS

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RIVER THEY TOOK OUT THREE DAMS

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:00.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ON THE MAIN STEM THEY TOOK OUT A

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:03.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SEVERAL ON SMALL TRIBUTARIES.

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:04.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE POOL WATER

01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:06.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UP IN THE HEADWATERS OF THE

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:07.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

YEAR OLDS SPEND A LOT OF THEM

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:12.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOURS MIXED IN THERE TOO AS YOU

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:14.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAN SEE FROM THE SHOT. SO WHY

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN'T WE DO THAT IN CALIFORNIA

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:17.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IN FACT WERE CAUTIOUSLY

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:18.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:20.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEE THIS WHEN THE KLAMATH DAMS

01:38:20.461 --> 01:38:22.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COME OUT. AND MAYBE WE WILL BE

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:24.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKING AT A FUTURE LIKE THIS.

01:38:25.065 --> 01:38:27.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I WANT TO SWITCH IT AND TALK

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:29.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. FOR BRIEF

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:30.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MOMENTS AND THAT IS WE'RE

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:31.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOOKING AT SOME PRETTY STIFF

01:38:31.538 --> 01:38:34.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FEDERAL THREATS TO OUR WATER

THIS YEAR.

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:38.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITHOUT GOING INTO GREAT DETAIL

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:39.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

SEVERAL TIMES TO THE WINNER AND

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:48.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UP THE STATE HAS NOT. GIVEN

THEIR PERMISSION. AND BASICALLY

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT PLAYED BALL THE OTHER THING

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:52.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IS THAT THE BUREAU OF

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

GOING TO WIPE OUT WHEN A RUN. TO

01:41:26.313 --> 01:41:29.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
CAPTURED.

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT YOU TO

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE COMMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:32.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BERMAN FISH AND WILDLIFE ROAD ON

01:41:32.686 --> 01:41:34.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SITES WHICH WERE AN EYE OPENER.

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:37.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL THEY SAY

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:38.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU CAN OPERATE IT BUT IF YOU

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:40.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALLOW THE FLOWS NEED FOR SAM AND

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:42.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU WILL BE DIVERTING FAR FEWER

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:44.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE DAYS AND MONTHS AND EVEN

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:46.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WATERTIGHT PEERS. THAN YOU THINK

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:47.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO WITHOUT GOING INTO THAT I

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WOULD JUST POINT TO THAT.

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:52.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMENT LETTER BACK IT WAS A

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:54.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
REAL EYE OPENER FOR US.

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:57.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PLEASE THIS ONE LAST COMMENT AS.

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:58.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAYBE TOO MUCH COMMON SENSE%

01:41:58.612 --> 01:42:00.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGAIN I DON'T KNOW OR SOME IT IS

01:42:00.981 --> 01:42:03.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
VERY SIMPLE AND AND NOT EDUCATED

01:42:03.217 --> 01:42:04.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
ENOUGH AND MAYBE.

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:06.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:08.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH WE HAVE WE SOLD THE PUBLIC

01:42:08.121 --> 01:42:10.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ON A LOT OF BONDS AND IN

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:12.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROJECTS THAT. NEVER COME TO

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:15.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FRUITION THAT THAT. THAT DON'T.

01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:16.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOLVE WHAT WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:18.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
SOLVE.

01:42:18.398 --> 01:42:20.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I THINK AT SOME POINT WE ARE

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:21.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:23.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PUBLIC. BUT WE'RE LOSING PUBLIC

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:25.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRUST REALLY FAST AS LEGISLATIVE

01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:27.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BODY BEEN IN WHO GET CAUGHT UP

01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:28.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN COURTS AND ALL KINDS OF

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:30.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINGS WE DON'T PRODUCE WHAT WE

01:42:30.744 --> 01:42:32.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAY WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE. AND

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:33.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I THINK AT SOME POINT WE'VE

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:35.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'VE RUN A RISK THAT THE PEOPLE

01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:36.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ON THE FACE OF THIS ANYMORE WE

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:38.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ASK THEM

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:40.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR THE RESOURCES TO GET THE JOB

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:43.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DONE WHEN YOU GET DOWN.

01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:44.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NO THANK YOU MR LEADER AND NEVER

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:46.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIMPLE IT WHATSOEVER AND JUST

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:47.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE AND

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:49.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR YOUR FEEDBACK AS WELL THANK

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:50.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE REST HERE

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:52.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WELL AND AND THAT'S WHY WE ALSO

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:54.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUGHT TO FOCUS ON WATERSHEDS

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:56.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE AS WATER AS SNOW. THE

01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:58.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BLUE SNOW PACKED WE HAVE TO BE

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABLE TO MANAGE THAT WATER COMING

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOWN TO THE SIERRAS AND. THAT

01:43:02.376 --> 01:43:03.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE ISSUE ABOUT SOME THE TUNNELS

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:05.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IN THE HYDROLOGY THROUGH TE

01:43:05.212 --> 01:43:07.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DELTA. AS WE MOVE WATER MORE

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:08.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUICKLY THROUGH THE DELTA WHICH

01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:10.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS PART OF THE PLAN WE ALSO

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:11.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PULLED OUT OF THE SEARS FASTER

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:13.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH RAISES THE TEMPERATURE THE

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:14.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WATER WHICH IS DETRIMENTAL TO

01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:16.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE FISH SO THAT. THE AND A LOT

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:19.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE THE FOLKS WERE LOOKING AT

01:43:19.092 --> 01:43:20.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE HYDROLOGY THE DELTA REALLY

01:43:20.394 --> 01:43:21.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:23.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
UPPER WATERSHEDS WHICH IS

01:43:23.263 --> 01:43:24.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETHING THAT WEEK WE HAVE TO

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:26.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOOK AT IT. IS THAT YOU KNOW

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:28.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S A REMARKABLE PICTURE AND

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:30.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEE WHAT CAN RECOVER IF WE ARE

01:43:30.504 --> 01:43:33.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WILLING. TO RETHINK HOW WE

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:35.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MANAGE WATERSHEDS AND HOW WE

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:36.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MANAGE THE SYSTEMS THAT THAT

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:39.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALLOW THE FISH TO COME BACK INTO

01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:43.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND AS WE DEAL WITH THE. EFFECTS

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:44.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
OF CHANGING.

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:45.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WATER PATTERNS TO THE STATE

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:46.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHERE IT'S WARMER COMING AT

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:47.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIFFERENT TIMES IN MANAGING

01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:49.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOSE FLOWS IT'S A VERY LARGE

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:52.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPREHENSIVE. ISSUE THAT NOT.

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:54.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVERYBODY'S WORKING TOWARDS THE

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:56.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAME ULTIMATE GOAL AND THAT'S

01:43:56.196 --> 01:43:58.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WHERE WE GET. THE.

01:43:58.365 --> 01:43:59.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEAH THE TUNNELS IN THE DELTA

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:02.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITHOUT LOOKING AT OTHER ASPECTS

01:44:02.102 --> 01:44:03.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OF IT AND THAT'S REALLY

01:44:03.403 --> 01:44:04.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DETRIMENTAL TO WHAT WE'RE

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:06.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ULTIMATELY TRYING TO LOOK AT

01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:08.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
BECAUSE THESE ARE ENTIRE
SYSTEMS.

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:09.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT WE TEND TO KIND OF

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PIECEMEAL OUT AS WE DO PLANNING

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:14.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND AND LOOK FOR THEMSELVES.

01:44:14.247 --> 01:44:16.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
JUST THE SUCCESS OF THE ROGUE

01:44:16.183 --> 01:44:17.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOPEFULLY THE KLAMATH. OTHER

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:19.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SYSTEMS.

01:44:19.519 --> 01:44:20.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS WE MANAGE ALL OF THAT WATER I

01:44:21.054 --> 01:44:22.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER SHOT

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:26.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF MEETING. MULTIPLE NEEDS THAT

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:27.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE

01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:30.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FISHERIES AS WELL AS WE DO. IS

01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:31.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE REALLY DO RESTORATION TO TRY

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:34.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THAT WE

01:44:34.201 --> 01:44:35.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE CONFERENCES SOLUTIONS.

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:37.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I. THINK IN THE COMMENTS BACK TO

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:39.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE VICE CHAIR THAT ONE.

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S GOOD TO LEADER DOLLY JUST

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:44.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE LAST COMMENT. AS YOU MANY

01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:46.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:48.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT I WORKED ON FORESTRY ISSUES

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:49.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FROM DAY ONE THAT I CAME HERE

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:52.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND YOU KNOW THE REAL. THE REAL.

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:54.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEADWATERS ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

01:44:54.354 --> 01:44:56.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHERE WE HAVE A FORCE THAT IS.

01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:57.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
OVERGROWN OVERSTOCKED.

01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:59.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DUE TO OUR SUPPRESSION OF FIRE

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:02.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS.

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:03.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT THE PACE IS GOING TO DO PUT

01:45:03.764 --> 01:45:05.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUR MEADOWS IN OUR IN OUR FORCED

BACK INTO SHAPE SO WE CAN

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:08.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ACTUALLY STORE HAVE CARBON

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:10.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SEQUESTRATION NUMBER ONE. NUMBER

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:12.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TWO STOP APPLE TRANSPIRATION

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
PROMOTIONAL.

01:45:14.074 --> 01:45:15.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BLOWN AWAY IN THE WIND AND

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:16.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTUALLY GET INTO THE GROUND AND

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT OFFERS WERE COMES ON THE

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:20.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SPRINGS AND IT'S COLD AT THE

01:45:20.213 --> 01:45:22.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RIGHT TIME YEAR. WE NEED TO MOVE

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:23.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AT A PACE HILL THERE TO.

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:25.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT OR

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:27.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE NOT THE AVAILABLE TODAY AND

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE'RE SEEIN MAGNIFIERS NOW.

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:31.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I KNOW THAT THERE'S LIKE THIRTY

01:45:31.124 --> 01:45:32.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SOME BILLS RENTED THIS

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:34.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEGISLATOR TO DEAL WITH FIRE.

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:35.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT BUT WE DID IT TAKE A GOOD

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:36.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CLOSE LOOK AT OUR WATERSHEDS IN

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:38.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MANAGE

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:39.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEM IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T FARM

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:41.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UP. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:44.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STORE CARBON AND AND WATER TO

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:45.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SAVE TIME.

01:45:45.672 --> 01:45:47.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABSOLUTELY. CANDIDLY IT WE'RE

OPPORTUNITY TO GO OVER THE TIME

LINE OF HOW WE GOT HERE AND WHAT

01:51:53.773 --> 01:51:54.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE CAN EXPECT IN THE FUTURE FOR

01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:56.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THREE REASONS ONE BECAUSE IT'S

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:58.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IT'S HELPFUL. TO.

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:00.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

WHO ARE HERE AS WELL AS THOSE

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:08.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
WHO ARE WATCHING.

01:52:08.354 --> 01:52:10.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OR WHO WILL BE WATCHING. THE

01:52:10.256 --> 01:52:13.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OTHER REASON IS THAT. THERE'S A

01:52:13.626 --> 01:52:15.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CLEAR MESSAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:52:15.095 --> 01:52:15.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONVEYED THAT THE WORK IS NOT

01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:16.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
DONE.

01:52:16.262 --> 01:52:17.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND WHILE ONE FISHERY IN

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:19.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN TAKING CARE

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:21.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

GOING TO CONTINUE. TO GIVE IT

01:52:25.605 --> 01:52:27.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALL THAT WE'VE GOT. AND THE

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:30.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THIRD REASON IS BECAUSE

01:52:30.777 --> 01:52:33.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DESCRIBING THIS LABORIOUS

01:52:33.813 --> 01:52:40.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROCESS WHICH TOOK YEARS I HOPE

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:41.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE

01:52:41.254 --> 01:52:43.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROCESS IS BROKEN. AND THAT

01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:46.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOMETHING ELSE NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:48.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND WE HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:52.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE. SO

WILL.

02:28:08.212 --> 02:28:11.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
IN FORT BRAGG USUALLY WE HAVE
OF.

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:13.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:28:13.551 --> 02:28:15.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MANY BOATS WORKING. RIGHT NOW WE

02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:17.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
HAVE FOUR.

02:28:17.121 --> 02:28:18.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVERYBODY ELSE IS JUST HOLDING

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:19.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEIR BREATH LOT OF GUYS ARE

02:28:19.957 --> 02:28:22.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GREAT WOULD THEY BRING ENOUGH

02:28:22.627 --> 02:28:23.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR THOSE FOUR BOATS BRINGING.

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:25.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE USUALLY BRING UP THE ANYWHERE

02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:26.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOME A THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:28.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POUNDS A DAY THE RING UP TWO TO

02:28:28.566 --> 02:28:30.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A DAY IS

02:28:30.768 --> 02:28:32.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY
HARVESTING.

02:28:32.336 --> 02:28:34.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THEN THE PERCENTAGES ARE

02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:35.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOWN ON AN AS IT SAID THEY WERE

02:28:36.007 --> 02:28:38.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DRIVING DEEPER AND THE PURCHASE

02:28:38.843 --> 02:28:40.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OR EATING BARNACLES. AND WE'VE

02:28:40.645 --> 02:28:41.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE YOU

02:28:41.746 --> 02:28:46.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S KIND OF LATE THEY WENT.

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:47.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
ALL THE CONFINED.

02:28:47.952 --> 02:28:48.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT'S THE STATE OF IT.

02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:50.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

02:28:50.421 --> 02:28:52.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S NOTHING YOU ARE IS SO WITH

02:28:52.990 --> 02:28:56.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT HELP. YOU OR NOT SEEN.

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:58.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REPLENISH WHAT SO YOU'RE NOT

02:28:58.362 --> 02:29:01.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEEN THEM GROW IT'S IT'S IT IS

02:29:01.465 --> 02:29:01.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BEEN.

02:29:01.666 --> 02:29:02.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:03.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT BEEN A MARKED IMPROVEMENT

02:29:03.734 --> 02:29:05.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SINCE THE LAST TIME WE TALKED

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:07.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WELL THERE IS ACTUALLY. THIS

02:29:07.271 --> 02:29:09.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAR LONG SAW SMALL LITTLE AREAS

02:29:09.307 --> 02:29:11.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHERE THERE WAS SOME SPORTS CAME

02:29:11.475 --> 02:29:11.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
OUT.

02:29:11.909 --> 02:29:14.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S THAT'S A SIGN THAT ALL

02:29:14.512 --> 02:29:16.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEED A WINDING DOWN. OF WHAT WE

02:29:16.714 --> 02:29:18.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEED THIS FOR THE KILL WE NEED

02:29:18.749 --> 02:29:22.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
THIS SPRING IS HAVE A COLD
WATER.

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:24.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ON HIM THING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

02:29:24.255 --> 02:29:25.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE GET THE NORTHWEST WINDS

02:29:25.756 --> 02:29:28.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BLOWING A BLOW THAT WARM WATER

02:29:28.092 --> 02:29:30.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OFF THE SURFACE IT BRINGS OUT. A

02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:33.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NUTRIENT RICH COLD WATER IN THE

02:29:33.664 --> 02:29:36.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEEP IF WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE A

02:29:36.834 --> 02:29:40.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHANCE OF GETTING MORE KILLED.

02:29:40.338 --> 02:29:42.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THAT'S WERE ALL HOPING AND

02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:45.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRAYING FOR. IN MY IGNORANCE AND

02:29:45.810 --> 02:29:52.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I APOLOGIZE SO FROM THE TIME YOU

02:29:52.483 --> 02:29:57.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GET TO SAY BYE. KNOCK ON WOOD.

02:29:57.822 --> 02:30:01.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE SEE THAT TOO. REPLENISHMENT

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:04.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF WHAT DOES NOT FORCE IF YOU

02:30:04.261 --> 02:30:09.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WILL USE TO LOOK LIKE WHAT'S

02:30:09.633 --> 02:30:09.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
TIMELINE ON THAT.

02:30:10.034 --> 02:30:10.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:30:11.001 --> 02:30:11.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A COUPLE YEARS PROBABLY TO GET

02:30:11.635 --> 02:30:12.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
READY REALLY BACK TO IT IF WE DO

02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:13.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GET KILLED. FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE

02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:14.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOOD CALC FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE

02:30:14.705 --> 02:30:15.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YEARS. THE SECOND YEAR GETS

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:16.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BETTER THE FIRST YEAR WHAT

02:30:16.107 --> 02:30:19.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
HAPPENS WITH THE URCHINS TIME TO
GO THROUGH THE FIRST

02:30:19.543 --> 02:30:21.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEAR. JUST. STRUGGLING WITH IT

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:23.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT IT IS GETTING BETTER BY THE

02:30:23.681 --> 02:30:25.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SECOND YEAR THEY'RE USUALLY

02:30:25.516 --> 02:30:28.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BETTER THEIR FIRMED UP. SO IT

02:30:28.586 --> 02:30:30.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
TWO YEARS AT MINIMUM.

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:32.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IN JUST LOOKING AT THE.

02:30:32.089 --> 02:30:34.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE LANDINGS REAL QUICK FORT

02:30:34.325 --> 02:30:35.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BRAGG HERE IN TWO THOUSAND

02:30:35.559 --> 02:30:38.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIFTEEN IT WAS A LITTLE OVER ONE

02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:39.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS.

02:30:39.563 --> 02:30:41.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THREE

02:30:41.932 --> 02:30:43.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND. IF WE

02:30:43.768 --> 02:30:44.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SANTA BARBARA

02:30:44.802 --> 02:30:46.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AREA ALMOST FOUR POINT NINE

02:30:46.604 --> 02:30:49.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MILLION POUNDS OTHER DOWN TO ONE

02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:52.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POINT SIX MILLION. LAST YEAR

02:30:52.376 --> 02:30:55.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S THIS MASSIVE DECREASES PAUL

02:30:55.546 --> 02:30:57.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
MASSIVE MASSIVE.

02:30:57.281 --> 02:30:58.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND IT'S THIS IS REALLY

02:30:58.682 --> 02:30:59.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DEVASTATING FOR THE WHOLE

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:01.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BUSINESS

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:03.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS WHAT IT IS AND IT'S. YOU KNOW

02:31:03.087 --> 02:31:05.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

YOU SO MUCH. PRESSURE.

02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:38.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT. JUST A COMMENT ON THE ON

02:31:38.656 --> 02:31:40.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE CAL AT THE OCEAN PROTECTION

02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:42.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
COUNCIL WELL IN THIS

02:31:42.393 --> 02:31:43.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SUBCOMMITTEE ON COST OF

PROTECTION WHICH IS A COMMITTEE

02:31:44.495 --> 02:31:45.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT I HAVE HERE WE. HAD.

02:31:45.896 --> 02:31:47.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PC AND TALK ABOUT YOUR GRASS

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:49.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND CAL AND IT'S IT'S REALLY

02:31:49.667 --> 02:31:51.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STARTLING TO SEE. SOME OF THE

02:31:51.502 --> 02:31:53.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GRAPHICS ABOUT THE THE LOSS OF

02:31:53.537 --> 02:31:54.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE KELP FOREST WHICH IS

02:31:54.972 --> 02:31:58.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OBVIOUSLY IMPACTING WRITERS THE

02:31:58.209 --> 02:32:00.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
URCHIN POPULATION BUT. IT'S ALSO

02:32:00.177 --> 02:32:01.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SHOWING SOME SIGNIFICANT

02:32:01.512 --> 02:32:02.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BENEFITS FROM THE OCEAN

02:32:02.446 --> 02:32:03.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHEMISTRY STANDPOINT IF WE'RE

02:32:04.014 --> 02:32:07.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO PROTECT. SHELLFISH AND

02:32:07.451 --> 02:32:10.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HOW SHELLFISH GROW THEY THE

02:32:10.454 --> 02:32:11.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHEMISTRY NEEDS TO BE CORRECT.

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:13.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO THEIR LOTS OF DIFFERENT

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:16.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LAYERS TO THE. THE LOSS OF THE

02:32:16.227 --> 02:32:19.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KELP FORESTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:20.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT ONLY IMPACTING THE FISHERIES

02:32:20.598 --> 02:32:23.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE. BUT CHANGING THE THE

02:32:23.667 --> 02:32:27.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHEMISTRY PREVENTING THE LACK OF

02:32:27.538 --> 02:32:28.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE FORCE PREVENT SOME OF THE

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:34.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUFFERS THAT WE NEED. AND AS THE

02:32:34.612 --> 02:32:35.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE GET MORE CARBON IN THE OCEAN.

02:32:35.379 --> 02:32:35.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHANGING THAT THAT CHEMISTRY AND

02:32:36.046 --> 02:32:36.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STARTING TO PROVIDE SOME A

02:32:36.747 --> 02:32:37.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LITTLE BIT MORE ACID IN WHATEVER

02:32:37.948 --> 02:32:38.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SMALL AMOUNTS BUT IT CAN BE

02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:39.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DEVASTATING. TO OYSTERS TO

02:32:39.984 --> 02:32:41.218 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
SHELLFISH PRODUCTION OF ANY
KIND.

02:32:41.285 --> 02:32:41.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THESE ARE THESE ARE VERY

02:32:41.819 --> 02:32:43.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMPLICATED BUT IN A RELATED

02:32:43.721 --> 02:32:47.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ISSUES AND FINDING WAYS TO PUT.

02:32:47.691 --> 02:32:49.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE THE ALLERGIES BACK IN THE

02:32:49.393 --> 02:32:51.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OCEAN AND GET THEM TO GROW IS IS

02:32:51.862 --> 02:32:53.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO HELP US ON A NUMBER OF

02:32:53.397 --> 02:32:54.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIFFERENT LEVELS SO IT'S A IT'S

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:56.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A BIG ISSUE THAT WE NEED A LOT

02:32:56.333 --> 02:32:58.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MORE SCIENCE ON. AND TO BE

02:32:58.802 --> 02:33:00.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LOOKING A LOT MORE CLOSELY.

I COME FROM A COMMERCIAL

02:34:00.664 --> 02:34:01.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS. AND

02:34:05.235 --> 02:34:07.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TIMES HAVE CHANGED. AND WE'VE

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:08.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORKED HARD TO CHANGE WITH THEM.

02:34:08.672 --> 02:34:10.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO SUCCESSFULLY ADAPT TO NEW

02:34:10.207 --> 02:34:11.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REGULATORY SYSTEMS SUCH AS

BE REALLY EASY TO GET INTO THE

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:24.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WEEDS HERE WHICH BELIEVE ME I

02:34:24.788 --> 02:34:27.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DID WHEN DRAFTING THESE REMARKS.

02:34:27.524 --> 02:34:29.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT'S LATE IN THE DAY AND I

02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:30.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WANT TO DO THAT TO YOU AND.

02:34:30.127 --> 02:34:33.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I HAVE ANOTHER HAD TO PUT ON IN

02:34:33.197 --> 02:34:33.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A MINUTE SO I JUST WANT TO SHOW

02:34:34.064 --> 02:34:35.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THREE PRINCIPLES THAT I THINK

02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:36.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE REALLY. IMPORTANT TO ALL

02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:38.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AREAS OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

02:34:38.669 --> 02:34:39.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THIS

02:34:39.837 --> 02:34:42.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ISSUE AND PRINCIPLE ONE IS THAT

02:34:42.072 --> 02:34:43.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMMERCIAL FISHING BUSINESSES

02:34:43.374 --> 02:34:46.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NEED LEXIBILITY TO SURVIVE.

02:34:46.176 --> 02:34:48.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
OVER THE YEARS FISHING

02:34:48.145 --> 02:34:50.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUSINESSES LIKE ALMOST EVERY

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:51.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OTHER BUSINESS HAVE TO ADAPT.

02:34:51.815 --> 02:34:52.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT COULD

02:34:52.383 --> 02:34:52.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INCLUDE THE NEED TO CHANGE

02:34:52.983 --> 02:34:54.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
VESSELS HAVE A SAFER FISHING

02:34:54.685 --> 02:34:56.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLATFORM. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN

02:34:56.687 --> 02:34:57.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FOUR DOES NOT

02:34:57.688 --> 02:34:58.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALLOW FOR THIS WITHOUT A VESSEL

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:01.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BEING DESTROYED. AND THAT'S

02:35:01.425 --> 02:35:01.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FORCING PARTICIPANTS OUT OF THE

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:03.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FISHERY.

02:35:03.093 --> 02:35:04.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TWO REGULATIONS NEED TO BE

02:35:04.495 --> 02:35:06.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UPDATED RATHER THAN USED AS A

02:35:06.563 --> 02:35:07.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REASON TO PERPETUATE UNINTENDED

02:35:07.965 --> 02:35:09.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
CONSEQUENCES. ARE THE

02:35:09.533 --> 02:35:10.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRANSFERABILITY RESTRICTIONS IN

02:35:10.701 --> 02:35:13.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

FISHERIES AND NOT PEOPLE. THE

02:35:31.188 --> 02:35:32.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CURRENT SITUATION IS RESULTING

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:54.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHERE DO YOU FIND MOST STUFF

02:39:54.384 --> 02:39:56.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOLKS HAVE LOST IT BASED OFF OF

02:39:56.687 --> 02:39:57.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WEATHER CONDITIONS?

02:39:58.021 --> 02:40:00.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OR INTERNED IN IMPORTANTLY

02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:02.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISCUSS THEM OUT THERE TALK

AND YOU KNOW LOST GEAR IS A PART

02:40:10.901 --> 02:40:12.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OF COMMERCIAL FISHING FOR

02:40:12.502 --> 02:40:13.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
DUNGENESS CRAB.

02:40:13.403 --> 02:40:17.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

YES IT'S BEEN FOR YOU KNOW I

02:40:20.844 --> 02:40:23.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALWAYS A PART OF THE FISHERY SO

02:40:23.213 --> 02:40:24.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IT'S IT'S NOT

02:40:24.715 --> 02:40:25.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMETHING THE FISHERMEN DO ON

02:40:25.882 --> 02:40:29.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
PURPOSE. THERE'S SOME
OCCASIONAL.

02:40:29.152 --> 02:40:30.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOTS OF IT OUT THERE BUT FOR THE

02:40:30.754 --> 02:40:33.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MOST PART IT'S THE STRAGGLERS

02:40:33.156 --> 02:40:34.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POTS TO GET SEPARATED FROM THE

02:40:34.324 --> 02:40:35.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REST OF THE STRING. POTS THAT

02:40:36.026 --> 02:40:37.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE MOVED BY WHETHER POTS THAT

02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:42.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THEY GET LEFT AND THERE'S A

02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:43.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
PERCENTAGE.

02:40:43.233 --> 02:40:44.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN PARTICULARLY STORMY YEARS

02:40:44.935 --> 02:40:47.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS YEAR WE SAW MORE THAT WE

02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:48.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

02:40:52.109 --> 02:40:53.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MEANT THAT MORE GEAR WAS LOST.

02:40:53.677 --> 02:40:56.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

PROGRAMS AND AND. WE'RE NOT

02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:18.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CLEAR ON ON WHAT THOSE CHANGES

02:57:18.961 --> 02:57:22.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:25.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEN WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT

IN STRONG ENFORCEMENT.

02:57:36.979 --> 02:57:38.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE THINK THAT STATE AGENCIES

02:57:38.514 --> 02:57:39.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEED TO CONTINUALLY ASSESS HOW

02:57:39.949 --> 02:57:42.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

03:07:36.812 --> 03:07:41.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRIPS WALKS THROUGH THAT YEAH

03:07:41.483 --> 03:07:42.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT IT IN MY.

03:07:42.684 --> 03:07:43.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT JUST TO PUT IN CONTEXT WE WE

03:07:43.919 --> 03:07:45.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE PROBABLY THE MOST MONEY

WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE

03:07:46.722 --> 03:07:47.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING SELECTED

AND FUNDED BY THESE FUNDS ARE

03:07:59.368 --> 03:08:00.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE REALLY NEEDED AND THEY'RE

03:08:00.902 --> 03:08:02.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEY'RE. BEING IMPLEMENTED

03:08:02.337 --> 03:08:03.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SUCCESSFULLY AND I THINK

03:08:03.939 --> 03:08:05.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INDIVIDUALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE

DOING THE RIGHT THING I DON'T

03:08:07.142 --> 03:08:09.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THINK WE HAVE A STRATEGIC

03:08:09.411 --> 03:08:10.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING THEM I

03:08:10.612 --> 03:08:11.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK WE'RE DOING YOU KNOW IF

03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:13.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU THINK ABOUT THE BREADTH OF.

03:08:22.090 --> 03:08:23.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT'S A BIG AREA THERE'S A LOT

03:08:23.759 --> 03:08:25.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF NEED. AND SO WE'RE KIND OF

03:08:25.861 --> 03:08:27.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SEEING A SCATTERSHOT OF PROJECTS

03:08:27.796 --> 03:08:28.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
AND. SO ONE OF THE

03:08:28.964 --> 03:08:30.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I THINK THE

03:08:30.532 --> 03:08:31.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
DEPUTY DIRECTOR.

03:08:31.366 --> 03:08:33.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

CONCERN OR OR OR SENTIMENT WHICH

03:08:35.270 --> 03:08:37.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THAT WE NEED BETTER STRATEGIC

03:08:37.606 --> 03:08:40.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PLANNING.

03:08:40.242 --> 03:08:43.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SO WE NEED YOU KNOW STAFF

03:08:43.412 --> 03:08:45.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PEOPLE WITHIN AGENCIES OUT FRONT

03:08:45.414 --> 03:08:48.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW WHERE'D

03:08:48.250 --> 03:08:49.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHERE'D AND WHERE'S THE BEST

03:08:49.751 --> 03:08:51.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PLACE TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS

03:08:51.787 --> 03:08:54.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WERE GETTING PROJECTS READY.

03:08:54.322 --> 03:08:57.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IDENTIFYING GEOGRAPHIES THAT

03:08:57.793 --> 03:09:01.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WE CAN INVEST IN THAT OLD

03:09:01.463 --> 03:09:04.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'LL HAVE A LONG TERM STABLE

03:09:04.332 --> 03:09:06.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BENEFIT.

03:09:06.168 --> 03:09:09.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE TALK ABOUT STRONGHOLDS

03:09:09.404 --> 03:09:12.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S THAT'S ONE CONCEPT THAT

03:09:12.974 --> 03:09:20.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE THINK IS IS IS REALLY A GOOD

03:09:20.248 --> 03:09:20.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THING.

03:09:20.449 --> 03:09:20.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:09:20.916 --> 03:09:21.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I WOULD SAY. THAT IF WE LOOK

03:09:21.817 --> 03:09:22.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT THE SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE OR

03:09:22.751 --> 03:09:23.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE SAN JOAQUIN. IN THE MAIN

03:09:23.852 --> 03:09:25.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STEM IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO

03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:25.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE ADMITS CAN'T TAKE BILLIONS

03:09:25.954 --> 03:09:27.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RIGHT. IN OUR LINE TO AN

03:09:27.923 --> 03:09:31.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
INCREASE YOU KNOW AND THE OTHER
THING IS

03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:32.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE JUST WHAT I THINK WE STARTED

03:09:32.694 --> 03:09:34.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO SEE SOME SOME RECOVERY ARE

03:09:34.262 --> 03:09:35.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WATERSHEDS ARE. ARE PROBABLY

03:09:35.931 --> 03:09:37.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTHIER NOW THAN THEY WERE A

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:39.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FEW DECADES AGO BECAUSE OF SOME

03:09:39.434 --> 03:09:40.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE REGULATIONS THE TIMBER

03:09:40.602 --> 03:09:42.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INDUSTRY AND SO FORTH AND AND SO

03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:43.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUALLY NOW. THAT THE TIMBER

03:09:44.005 --> 03:09:45.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INDUSTRY IS IS IT A GOOD PARTNER

03:09:45.907 --> 03:09:47.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR RESTORATION BECAUSE THEY

03:09:47.509 --> 03:09:49.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE LARGE OWNERSHIP OF LAND.

03:09:49.111 --> 03:09:50.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND SO WE'RE SEEING BETTER

03:09:50.545 --> 03:09:52.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POPULATION RECOVERY THERE. BUT

03:09:52.481 --> 03:09:54.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN DROUGHT CANNABIS EX YOU

03:09:55.016 --> 03:09:55.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
KNOW COME IN TO KIND OF

03:09:55.751 --> 03:09:56.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
UNDERMINED UNDER CUT THE

03:09:56.985 --> 03:09:58.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING.

03:09:58.320 --> 03:10:00.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO WATER IT REALLY IS A

03:10:00.355 --> 03:10:02.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE RIGHT NOW. I

03:10:02.224 --> 03:10:03.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KNOW THE STATE WATER BOARD.

03:10:04.025 --> 03:10:05.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND THE PARTITION WHILE IF

03:10:06.027 --> 03:10:07.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WATER BRANCH OR OR INITIATING

03:10:07.763 --> 03:10:10.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEW PROGRAMS TO LOOK STATEWIDE

03:10:10.132 --> 03:10:12.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT SETTING ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS.

03:10:12.834 --> 03:10:14.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE

03:10:14.503 --> 03:10:15.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S GONNA BE VERY CHALLENGING

03:10:15.570 --> 03:10:18.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
WITH ALL THE WATER USERS WE
HAVE.

03:10:18.406 --> 03:10:19.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND AND SLOW GOING BUT THAT

03:10:19.875 --> 03:10:23.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:83%
NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED WE NEED
TO-IDENTIFY. THROUGHOUT THE STATE

03:10:23.678 --> 03:10:25.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STREAM FLOWS THAT ARE NEEDED

03:10:25.180 --> 03:10:26.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO SUPPORT THE PUBLIC TRUST

03:10:27.048 --> 03:10:30.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESOURCES THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE

03:10:30.485 --> 03:10:33.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW IT'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

AMAZING. YEAH IN AT YOU KNOW

03:10:37.292 --> 03:10:38.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW I THINK ON

03:10:38.326 --> 03:10:42.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ISSUE OF A CANNABIS IS WELL

03:10:42.664 --> 03:10:43.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE

03:10:43.665 --> 03:10:47.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I CAN I SPEAK. TO THE NORTH

THE FACTORS NEED TO BE TAKEN THE

PLACE AND. IS TO ENCOURAGE THE

THAT MAN IS A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:15:28.416 --> 03:15:29.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH.

03:15:29.484 --> 03:15:30.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ALSO I

03:15:30.251 --> 03:15:34.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

COMPREHENSIVE. THING AND THEN

03:15:38.693 --> 03:15:39.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD

03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:42.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PRESS. NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHICH IS

03:15:42.163 --> 03:15:44.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS AND POLICY

03:15:47.035 --> 03:15:49.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BECAUSE.

03:15:49.137 --> 03:15:50.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
