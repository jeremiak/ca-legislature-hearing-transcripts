THIS DOESN'T ALREADY FALL UNDER

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:52.243
PENAL CODE SECTION FIVE TWENTY

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.677

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:57.148
IMPERSONATION. WELL WHAT IT SET

00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:57.749
WHEN CALIFORNIA WE CAN QUALIFY

WHATEVER BECAUSE WE WANT TO GO

00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:01.152

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:02.387
DIFFERENTLY WE WANNA BE'S WE

WANT TO BE SQUEAKY CLEAN AND

00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:05.090
CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:05.790
CANNOT IMPERSONATE A CENSUS

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:06.925
WORKER. AND THAT YOU CANNOT ACT

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:07.492
AS IF YOU'RE IMPERSONATING A

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:08.994
CENSUS WORKER SO THERE ARE LAWS

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.627
ABOUT IMPERSONATING THEIR LAWS

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:11.096
ABOUT SCAMMING BUT WE WANT TO

00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:12.797
BE. ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR

00:27:12.864 --> 00:27:14.299
AND YOU AND I WILL PUBLIC BOTH

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:14.899
AGREE THAT IT'S A BI PARTISAN

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.935
EFFORT THAT WE ASSURE THAT

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:18.303
CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUES TO

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.471
HAVE ALL ITS CONGRESSIONAL

00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:21.206
DELEGATION NUMBER ONE WHEN IT

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:21.740
COMES TO COUNTING AND THE

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:23.308
NUMBER TWO ALL THE BILLIONS OF

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.977
DOLLARS THAT WE STAND TO LOSE.

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.212
FIVE SO I THINK I THINK WE

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:27.812
WOULD AGREE THAT THIS IS AN

00:27:27.879 --> 00:27:29.014
IMPORTANT MEASURE AS IT RELATES

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.248
TO SECURING THE CALIFORNIA GETS

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:31.049
ITS FAIR SHARE FROM THE FEDERAL

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.618
GOVERNMENT. SO IF THERE ARE ANY

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:35.320
MEASURES THAT WE CAN TAKE TO

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:36.454
ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY IS

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:37.822
COUNTED AND FEEL SAFE BEING

00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:44.963
COUNTED. I'M SURE THAT YOU YOU

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.563
YOU'D AGREE THAT THAT THIS IS

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:50.268
IMPORTANT. I JUST LIKE TO ADD.

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.469
AS THE ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:52.337
THAT PENAL CODE FIVE TWENTY

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:52.971
NINE REQUIRE SOMETHING OF VALUE

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:54.272
IS MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT IS

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:56.041
TRANSMITTED SO THAT WHEN THEY

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:56.541
IMPERSONATE THEY OBTAIN

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:58.510
SOMETHING OF VALUE. IT IS HARD

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.078
TO CODIFY. THE DETERRENCE OF

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:01.379
JUST. FOR INSTANCE IF I WANTED

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:03.415
TO SOMEONE AND I SAID I'M FROM

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:05.316
THE CENSUS. I DON'T THINK YOU

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:06.684
SHOULD TAKE IT. YOU SHOULD YOU

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:08.286
SHOULD FILL OUT THE SURVEY OR I

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.521
PRETENDED TO BE FROM THE CENSUS

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:10.822
AND AYE DETER DO FROM TAKING

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:12.223
IT. QUALIFYING THAT AMOUNT IS

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.025
DIFF. DIFFICULT AS OPPOSED TO

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:14.926
TRADITIONAL FORMS OF FRIED

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.594
WHERE YOU WOULD SAY. I'D LIKE

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:18.129
YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER. AND

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.065
SAID THIS CLARIFIES THAT THIS

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:20.799
IS JUST TO SEEK OUT

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:27.272
INFORMATION. AND TO INTERFERE.

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:27.839
WITH THE PROCESS. OKAY THANK

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:32.944
YOU. ARE THERE ANY UP MISS COME

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.847
LOADED UP. THANK YOU I WAS

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:36.848
WANTING COULD YOU SHARE WHAT

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:37.715
WHY THE THOUGHT WAS TO MAKE IT

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:38.283
A MISDEMEANOR RATHER THAN AN

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:40.418
INFRACTION. I THINK THE IDEA

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:41.352
WAS THAT WE WANTED TO WEIGH THE

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:46.658
IMPORTANCE OF THE CRIME. AND IT

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:47.225
IS CRITICAL I MEAN IF I MAY

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:49.961
MISTER CHAIR. YES THAT IS

00:28:50.028 --> 00:28:52.130
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I MEAN

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:53.698
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:55.166
TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WERE

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:56.734
TERRIFIED ABOUT GETTING COUNTED

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:57.335
AND WE THOUGHT THAT WE THOUGHT

00:28:57.402 --> 00:29:02.740
THAT. I REALIZE THAT THAT WE

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:04.709
NEED FROWN UPON CREATE AN

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:09.614
ADDITIONAL. CRIMES FOR REASONS

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:11.316
FOR PEOPLE TO BE. PENALIZED IN

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:13.218
THE SYSTEM BUT THIS ONE'S

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:13.751
CRITICAL I MEAN WE'RE NOT

00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:15.887
TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE NOT

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:17.655
TALKING ABOUT JUST PEOPLE

00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:18.456
SCAMMING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.091
PEOPLE COMING TO PEOPLE'S DOORS

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.893
GRABBING PERSONAL INFORMATION

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.694
DOCUMENT AND DOT ARE NOT

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.963
DOCUMENTED AND POTENTIALLY A

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:27.132
COORDINATING WHAT WITH AGENCIES

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:29.467
A THE- WHAT'S THE TO SAY YOU

00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:30.802
CAN POTENTIALLY CORNY WITH ICE

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:31.769
AND THIS IS CRITICAL HE CAN

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:32.937
SCAN PEOPLE IT'S HAPPENING IN

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:34.105
MY NEIGHBORHOOD ALL THE TIME.

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:34.772
WE'RE ALREADY START TO SEE WHAT

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:36.474
PEOPLE KNOCK ON THE DOOR NOW

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:37.675
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:40.845
THOSE WERE SCAMMING IT DIRECTLY

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:43.014
FOR SOME SORT OF MONETARY GAIN.

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:45.817
BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:46.451
WILL BE THOSE WHO WILL BE STARS

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:48.186
CAM AS SCAMMING WILL START
