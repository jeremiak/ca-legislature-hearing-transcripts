ITEMS ONE TWO AND THREE ARE IN CONSENT SO OUR FIRST ITEM TODAY'S I AM NUMBER FOUR SB SEVEN FORTY NINE BY SENATOR GLAZERS I SEE THAT HE'S HERE WELCOME. PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU A- THANK YOU CHAIR PANEL ON IT THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFFER ALLOW ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL AND FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS VILLAGE DURING THE AUTHORED BY SENATOR EGGMAN. MUCH APPRECIATION TO HER AND WE HAVE CO AUTHORS FROM THIS COMMITTEE- CO AUTHORS INCLUDE SENATOR RUBIO AND WIENER AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR NIELSEN FOR ALSO BEING A CO AUTHOR. SB SEVEN FORTY NINE IS A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE. THAT WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT TO POLICY MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE. ABOUT HOW COUNTIES ARE USING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS. AND HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE SERVING OUR CONSTITUENTS. WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. IN AN EFFORT TO HELP CALIFORNIANS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT WE HAVE PRECIOUS LITTLE DATA. TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHICH OF THE PROGRAMS WE ARE FINDING ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND WHICH OF THEM THEY'RE ACTUALLY HELPING THE PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED THIS ASSISTANCE. THIS IS NOT JUST MY OPINION. IS THE VIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. LAST SUMMER THE STATE AUDITOR RELEASED A REPORT. DETAILING THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY FOR HELL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS ARE BEING USED AND THE BENEFITS FROM THOSE SERVICES. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT BASED ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR IT WOULD CREATE A STATE FRAMEWORK FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION ON MENTAL HEALTH SPENDING AND OUTCOMES. THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. UNDER THIS BILL THE COMMISSION WILL BE REQUIRED TO COLLABORATE WITH STATE AND LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING PROGRAM. FOR COUNTY SPENDING ON MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND THE OUTCOMES FROM THAT SPENDING. THE COMMISSION WOULD PROVIDE ASSESSMENTS OF SPENDING OUTCOME PATTERNS BY DEVELOPING CATEGORIES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES INCLUDING EMERGENCY SERVICES AN INPATIENT SERVICES. CURRENT REPORTING RELIES ON A DISJOINTED INCOMPLETE TOOLS ARE RESULTS OF MULTIPLE FUNDING SOURCES. FROM DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND LEVELS OF TRANSPARENCY. L. AS A STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW COUNTIES ARE SPENDING FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND HOW THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO IMPROVE CONSTITUENTS MENTAL HEALTH. WITH ME- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS TOBY EWING. OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A- THANK YOU CENTER GLAZIER LET'S NOW MOVE TO- TOBY EWING- SO- MODERATOR IF YOU COULD BRING TOBY EWING ON TO LINE AND- ST LOUIS DR EWING YOU HAVE. TWO MINUTES TO PRESENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS TO BE DEALING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL. SB SEVEN FORTY NINE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S OVERALL EFFORTS AND THE COMMISSION. SPECIFIC EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IF THE INCLUDING THE FUNDS THAT ARE USED THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE ACHIEVED. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR LATER AND CO AUTHORS PARTICULARLY HIS STAFF FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE IN THIS BILL. THIS WOULD AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION TO ENHANCE WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING AND TO DEVELOP THIS. HAS DESCRIBED IN THE BILL A COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING SYSTEM ON SPENDING PROGRAMS AND OUTCOMES- MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE WORK THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DONE ON TRANSPARENCY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. SB SEVEN FORTY NINE IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR GOALS AND THE WORK THAT WE HAVE UNDER WAY- THE COMMITTEE IS AHEAD OF THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF THIS WORK AND WE WILL BE FORMALLY REVIEWING THE BILL- FOR SUPPORT AT THE- AT A MEETING ON THE TWENTY FIFTH- BUT IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR CHAIR. I WANTED TO SHARE THAT THIS REALLY DOES ALIGN WITH THE WORK THAT WE HAVE UNDER WAY. TOMORROW THE COMMISSION WILL BE HOLDING A DATA FORUM WHICH IS ACTUALLY SO OVERSUBSCRIBED WE'VE HAD TO TURN PEOPLE AWAY. THERE IS TREMENDOUS DEMAND FROM THE PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MONEY THAT IS COMING IN THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE BEING ACHIEVED- SO WE ARE VERY MUCH SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL I'M- I'M HAVING TO. LIMIT MY ABILITY TO SAY THAT WE SUPPORT IT BECAUSE. THE COMMISSION HASN'T TAKEN A FORMAL VOTE. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IS. A VERY CAN. WITH THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE- THAT WE LOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND BEING ABLE TO FORMALLY SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT WITH THAT I WANTED TO MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT ANYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE REGARDING OUR ABILITY TO DO THE WORK. THAT THE BILL IS CALLING FOR. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO- TESTIMONY AND SUPPORT TO NAME ORGANIZATION. AND POSITION ONLY FULL FIRST BEGAN WITH THE GALLERY PUBLIC GALLERY.

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT EXPENDITURES D. A. YES AN EXTENSIVE. I MEAN FOR THREE THREE YEAR PLANS AN ANNUAL UPDATES. WHICH INCLUDE PROGRAM LEVEL OUTCOMES DATA AND IN TURN THE DEMOCRATS SAY INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY ALREADY SHARED WITH THE COMMISSION. A REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT THE EXACT MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA TO ANOTHER STATE ENTITY IN A MANNER REQUESTED BY THAT STATE ENTITY IS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND ACTUALLY THIS IS THE ONE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO. BECAUSE OF THAT YOU PUT IT IN. IT BECAUSE IF YOU COULD GET OF THESE IF YOU'RE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND WOULD ADD SIGNIFICANT UNNECESSARY COSTS TO THE COUNTY THAN THE STATE I'M- IT AS ACCURATELY OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND TO REITERATE. THE BAFTA DONE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOLAN THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY SIMILAR BILL ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE- EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SIX AND LOOKED AT ACCOMPLISHING VERY SIMILAR GOAL. BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH A BILL EXTENDING THE SCOPE OF THE COMMISSION AUTHORITY OUTSIDE THEIR AREA OF EXPERTISE WHICH IS STATUTORILY LIMITED TO THE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THIS EXPANSION WOULD BE IN AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY OVERSEEN BY OTHER STATE ENTITIES PRIMARILY THE ACS THE COMMISSION. SPOKE OF THE STORY IS CLEARLY THE OUTLAW. WHEN WELFARE IN. CODE SEX. FIVE EIGHT FOUR FIVE WHICH- LIMITS THEIR ARE ALREADY THE MATH HEALTH OF ACT. SB SEVEN. HE'S BEEN LEADING UP.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A COMMENT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK TOBY EWING AND- WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND AS A AS A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I THINK THAT WHEN THIS COMMISSION WAS CREATED. A TO Z. MISTER EWING TO LEAD THIS COMMISSION WAS SOME. PRETTY PHENOMENAL IDEA AND SO- HE'S DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB AND I THINK THAT IT'S ADDED VALUE TO INDIVIDUALS SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CENTER EGGMAN. ALSO JUST TO AND- THINK THE AUTHOR AND AM SO HAPPY TO BE WORKING WITH HIM ON THIS. TO REALLY GET OUR ARMS AROUND ALL THE STREAMS OF MONEY THAT'S GOING INTO TREATING ARE FOR FOLKS WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND IF WE CAN IF WE CAN SEE WHERE IT'S ALL COMING FROM AND WHAT WORKS BEST. THEN I THINK WE HAVE A MUCH HIGHER. CHANCE THAT UNCERTAINTY. OF REALLY BEING ABLE TO TREAT EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS TO BE TREATED SO THANK YOU AND I'LL MOVE THIS BILL. OKAY SO THE BILLS- WILL BE MOVED IT FROM THE TIME TO CENTER EGGMAN US ARE RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I JUST WANNA LIVE MY COMMENTS CLOSELY WITH STUFF THE GREAT SENATOR FROM STOCKTON. WHO JUST MADE COMMENTS AND I THINK THIS IS SUCH A SUCH AN IMPORTANT BATTLE.

USING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING AN INEFFICIENT ENTRANCE CAN WEIGH IN WITH THAT I WILL ALSO URGE AN EYEFUL THANK YOU AND ALSO PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU CHAIR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THAT CENTER ROCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW- TYING INTO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST SAID THE I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION. AND WE CERTAINLY WANT EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN GOVERNMENT. BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHEN YOU LOOK UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND CERTAINLY WITHIN OUR- RESPECTIVE OF THE SENATE DISTRICTS THAT. DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE. STILL BE APPEARS TO BE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. YET THERE IS A TREMENDOUS DEMAND. FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. MANY AREAS OF OUR STATE ARE. CERTAINLY UNDERSERVED. AND THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH. FUNDING AND SERVICES. AND TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION WE SIMPLY NEED TO GET A HANDLE. ON WHERE THIS MONEY'S GOING HOW IT'S BEING SPENT AND WHETHER THERE IS. SUFFICIENT SEE AN EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS ASPECT. OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES SO I CERTAINLY COMMEND THE- THE VARIOUS AUTHORS ATTACHED TO THIS BILL. FOR THIS EFFORT AND I'M SURE AS IT MOVES. FOR IN THIS. TO THE OTHER AND HOPEFULLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK FOR SIGNATURE THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ANY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE FIXED THEIR FIXED BUT THAT THIS BILL GETS PASSED AND SIGNED.

IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES AND- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SO THE OPPOSITION SAYING THAT THE ORIGINAL STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION WAS JUST OVER THE PAST SIXTY THREE MONEY BUT WE NEED A BODY THAT OVERSEES ALL OF IT RIGHT AND- DOWN THEN IT'S WAS PASSED WHILE AGO- CERTAINLY YES THERE IS REPORTING TO DTS AND WE NEED TO DO THAT FOR YOU KNOW FOR FEDERAL MATCHING MONEY AND FACT ACTUALLY US IN LATER IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESSING YOU CLOSE THE DUPLICATION ISSUESWHICH I THINK ARE CERTAINLY ONES WE WANT TO BE SURE WE ADDRESS- THE IN TERMS OF DUPLICATION WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTIES HAVE TO.

OR LAW ON THE TODAY REQUIRE THAT DUPLICATE WOULD BE ELIMINATED. ONCE WE CREATE THIS- DIRECTION THAT'S FOR THAT'S PRESENTED IN THIS BILL. THE AUDITOR DID LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THIS ISSUE. AND THEY DESIGNATED THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AS THE ONE THEY THINK CAN DO THE MOST EFFECTIVE JOB. IN COLLECTING AND REPORTING ON THE STATUS. THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPPONENTS- WHOEVER IS THE TODAY.

I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND TAKING THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO THIS ISSUE THE EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT E. P. S. D. T. PROGRAM IS A STATE ADMINISTERED MEDICAID BENEFIT ENTITLING LOW INCOME INFANTS CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID AS WELL AS FOSTER USE THREE COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ONE OF THE LARGEST COMPONENTS OF THE BENEFIT IS INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES WHICH INCLUDE CRISIS BASED SERVICES COUNSELING AND THERAPY INTERVENTION AND MEDICATION MANAGEMENT COUNTIES CURRENTLY RECEIVE LIMITED GUIDANCE FROM THE STAY ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE PROGRAM AS A RESULT PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS VARY WITH EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES USER UTILIZING DIFFERENT SETS OF PAPERWORK TO ADMINISTER THE SAME TYPE OF SERVICE. THIS CREATES. CONFUSION FOR PROVIDERS AND RESULT IN CHILDREN EXPERIENCING CRITICAL GAPS IN CARE AND A LACK OF COORDINATED CARE WHILE ALSO INCREASING. COSTS TO THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE COUNTY'S AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ON HOW THIS INTERACTS WITH THE CURRENT CALTRAIN IMPLEMENTATION. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE'REHAPPY TO AMEND THE BILL AS I STATED EARLIER- TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE AND COORDINATE THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MEANS THE STREAMLINED AND SATURDAYS INTAKE ASSESSMENT. AND TREATMENT PLANTS WITH THE USE OF CONTRACTED PROVIDERS IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. WHAT ME TODAY ON THE PHONE TO SUPPORT THE BILL ARE- NEAR MORE AND DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND NANCY FACTOR. DIRECTOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FROM LIKELY GOT THAT ACCENT. THANK YOU CEREMONY AND THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND WORKING WITH MY STAFF NOW LET'S GO ON TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SO FOR- TESTIMONY SUPPORT- LET'S BRING ON THE LINE. IT'S MIRA MORTON FROM CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CALIFORNIA DOES HOSPITAL SOCIAIS ASIAN FOLLOWED BY NANCY FACTOR FROM LIKELY TO CUT THE LA RAZA SO. MODERATELY PLEASE BRING THEM ON THE LINE YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES TESTIFIED. THE MAYOR MARTIN IS ON THE LINE RIGHT YOU MAY BEGIN. WELCOME THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS NEAR MORTON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND A PROUD CO SPONSOR AT THE TWO NINETY THREE. TWENTY FIRST FORMED A WORK GROUP OF OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE ISSUE OF COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DOCUMENTATION RAPIDLY FLOATED TO THE TOP OF THE MAJOR PAIN POINTS.THEY NOTED IT CONSUMES REQUIRED OUR THE TRAIN TO COMPLETE CORRECTLY AND IS A LEADING DRIVER BURNOUT AND ATTRITION FOR THERAPY FOR THE MEDICARE POPULATION. IN THE FLIGHT AT THE TWO NINETY THREE IS REALLY A WORKFORCE BILL IN THE STATE IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF A MORE AND MORE CAPACITY AT CHILDREN'S. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. CAN REPRESENTATIVE. AND THE COMMITTEE AND I. FOR POINT OUT THAT THE ADMIN. PLAN TO ADDRESS SOME ASPECTS OF THE PAPERWORK BURDEN THROUGH TELLING. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS ATTENTION THIS ISSUE IS RECEIVING AND FOR THE COMMITMENT THE COUNTY TO DATE YES I'VE ALREADY MADE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE CHEMICALS ARE NOT AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP. IF WE ARE TO TRULY FREE OF THESE PROVIDERS TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST AND MAXIMIZE ACCESS TO THESE INVALUABLE SERVICES THE EFFORT MUST BE PUT STANDARDIZATION AND G. DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE OF THE COUNTY. KNOW WHAT CAN'T IT CAN'T BE ADDED BEYOND THE STANDARDIZED FORM. SPECIAL SIGNAL PROVIDERS FREQUENTLY FOR CHILDREN IN MULTIPLE COUNTY SOMETIMES MORE THAN TEN. AND EACH COUNTY REQUIRED DIFFERENT FORMS AND INTERPRET THE STATE REQUIREMENT DIFFERENTLY. THE FORCE OF PROVIDERS TO CREATE COMPLEX TRAINING ANNUAL TO TAKE TIME AWAY FROM PATIENTS TO LEARN WITHIN THEM. FOR THIS REASON WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT CAN ACHIEVE ITS STATED GOAL THAN TELLING WITHOUT STANDARDIZATION. IMPORTANTLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS A HISTORY OF STANDARDIZING FORM AND BENEFIT WHEN NEEDED TO ELIMINATE CONFUSION AND UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO CARE. FOR EXAMPLE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL-HEALTH SECRETIVE INTERNET CONTRACT SERVICE AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURE. AND A SET OF DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS INFORMED TO ENSURE FOSTER CHILDREN PLACED OUTSIDE THEIR HOME COUNTY. WHICH BUILDS WITH THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND AGAIN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE EGISLATURE REQUIRE REGULATORS TO STANDARDIZE THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FORM USED BY MANAGED CARE PLAN FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG APPROVAL. AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT A SIMILAR EFFORT IS NEEDED IN THE FACE AND FOR THIS REASON WE URGE YOU TO PASS AT THE TWO NINETY THREE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO NANCY FASTER WITH. THE LIKELY BECAUSE THE LA RAZA. THANK YOU RICHARD PAN AM. I'M HONORED TO BE THERE TO AND- THE- IN THE- URGENCY IN INCREASE. ACCESS TO MENTAL CARE FOR INSTANCE CHILDREN AND ADULTS. AND WILL IN MANY. FROM THE DIRECT BEHAVIOR HAVE THAT MUCH. GOD THE LEAD AFTER IN THE SIMPSONS BECAUSE AREA. WE OFFER. TO EPS TO PROGRAMS. TO DIFFERENT COUNTIES. IN THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS DIFFERSIGNIFICANTLY IN EACH COUNTY. RESULTING IN THE NEED TO RUN TO DISTINCT PARALLEL PROGRAM. WHICH IS INEFFICIENT DUPLICATE SCARCE RESOURCES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY REDUCES AVAILABLE STAFFING THAT WE NEED FOR DIRECT SERVICES. IN OUR PROGRAM ALONE WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE SUPERVISORY VACANCIES. AND OUR CLIENTS WOULD HAVE MUCH BETTER ACCESS TO CARE IF WE COULD STREAMLINE ACROSS. COUNTIES RATHER THAN DUPLICATE. ACTOR THAT THEM. IS HIGHER CLIMB DEMAND AND GREATER. THE SEVERITY WERE GROW GRAY EACH DAY WE ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO MEET THE NEEDS. YET ACT THERE OPEN SPEND 3240% OF THEIR TIME ON DOCUMENTATION. DISBURSING MISSTATED LOWER STAFF MORALE INCREASES TURNOVER AND DEPLETES ARE SCARCE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT WORKFORCE. LET ME GO ALONE HAS TEN THERAPIST VACANCIES AND THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO US. EACH THERAPIST WE LOSE IN SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH IS A SIGNIFICANT LOSS CAN TAKE YEARS TO REPLACE. REDUCTION IN WORKFORCE OBVIOUSLY RESULTING RESTRICTED ACCESS TO CARE AND FOR THE THERAPIST THAT STATE TIME USING DOCUMENTATION THAT. DOESN'T HAVE QUALITY ACCOUNTABILITY REDUCES ACCESS FURTHER INTO SOME VACANCIES TURNOVER DUPLICATION DISPROPORTIONATE TIME SPENT ON DOCUMENTATION. ALL WE DO IS ACCESS TO THE TIME WHEN THE DEMAND FOR CARE IS HIGHER THAN EVER. MY PREDECESSOR LESLIE PRESTON ADVOCATED FOR DOCUMENTATION REDUCTION IN STREAMLINING AND STANDARDIZATION FOR A DECADE. SHE DIED SADLY THREE YEARS AGO WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT AS LESLIE WOULD SAY. LET'S PROVIDE CARE FOR THE PATIENT NOT THE CHART.

NINETY THREE BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN GET CONCERNS RATHER THAN FORMALLY OPPOSED THE BILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE SHARE IMPORTANT OVER ARCHING GOALS WITH THE AUTHOR AND PROPONENT. ALONG WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER COMMUNITY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS HAVE CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATED TO SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. AT A CURRENTLY IN TO FIRST GIVEN HEALTH U. P. S. B. THIRD. WERE UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE IN ITS FORM WE ARE ULTIMATELY NOT SURE THE PROPOSAL AND AT THE G. NINETY THREE WILL BE NEEDED ONE FOR THE STATE HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. DOCUMENTATION REFORMS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INTEGRATING MEDIC HELLENISTIC SAYS FOR CALLING. THE CALENDAR TO KEEP WAIVER PACKAGE INCLUDES SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS THAT WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE DOCUMENTED AND CLEAN. PROPOSED REFORMS INCLUDE CHANGES TO MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENT REFORMS ANYTHING VERY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS TO ALIGN DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS WITH SCHOOLS THE EXCESS ELSEWHERE AND MEDIKAL AND AT THE FEDERAL. LEVEL FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE NEW. STANDARD FOR ME NOT. DOCUMENTATION AS ENVISIONED IN CALENDAR. WILL LARGELY ALLEVIATE THE NEED FOR THE STANDARDIZED FORM STRATEGY PROPOSED UNDER SB TWO NINETY THREE. WE ALSO THINK ITWILL BE IMPORTANT THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS WORKS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT CAL IN REFORM BECAUSE THEY ARE SO POTENTIAL AND WIDE RANGING. BEFORE ASSESSING WHETHER KALYAN HAS HELPED TO SOLVE OR SYSTEMIC DOCUMENTATION CHALLENGES AND TAKING FURTHER ACTION ON CHANGES LIKE THE STANDARDIZED FORM PROPOSED IN THE BILL. JERRY JERRY WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT CALIBER FORM WILL MEANINGFULLY AND FINALLY REDUCE THE EXCESSIVE DOCUMENTATION BURDEN THAT HAVE CHALLENGED OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS ALIKE THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS PROGRAM. WE EXPECT CALLING TO GET A COMPLEX MUCH OF WHAT THE CELTICS TO ACCOMPLISH AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT PROPONENTS AN AUTHOR TO CONSIDER WITHDRAWING THE LEGISLATION. AND THE FOCUS ON LAYERING YOU REQUIREMENTS FOR STANDARDIZED FORM. AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON EFFORTS TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO DEVELOP SIMPLIFIED AND STREAMLINED DOCUMENTATION PRACTICES UNDER CALAMP THAT ALIGN WITH THE WAY SERVICES ARE DOCUMENTED ELSEWHERE IN MY pMORE BROADLY.

SAN RAMON. PLEASE PM ME. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT REQUIRES ALL HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO SHARE HOW MUCH CONSUMERS HAVE PAID TOWARDS OUR DEDUCTIBLE AND MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET LIMITS DURING ANY MONEY THAT'S BENEFITS WHERE THERE USED MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE COVERAGE WITH DEDUCTIBLES SOMETIMES OVER A THOUSAND OR EVEN AS MUCH AS SEVEN THOUSAND OR EIGHT THOUSAND IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. NO STATE LAW REQUIRES PLANS OR INSURERS TO INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT WHERE THE CONSUMER IS IN MEETING THAT DEDUCTIBLE THE BURDEN OF TRACKING IN NAVIGATING THAT AMOUNT TOWARDS ANY DEDUCTIBLE FALLS STRICTLY UPON THE CONSUMER HEALTH PLANS HAVE INFORMATION ON RELEASE IT CURLS SINCE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REIMBURSING ANY PAYMENTS BEYOND THE MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT SHIFTS THE BURDEN OF KEEPING TRACK OF THE WEEK YOU'RE A GIRL TOWARDS THE DEDUCTIBLES AND MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKETS. FROM THE CONSUMERS TO THE HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS. TODAY WITH ME ARE- DIANA DOUGLAS FROM HEALTH ACCESS AND pLAW. ON WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU CEREMONY LET'S NOW MOVE TO OUR TO THE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT- SO MODERATOR. WE NEED DIANA DOUGLAS- FROM HEALTH ACCESS AND CHEN FLORIST IN THE WESTERN CENTER LONG POVERTY SO DIANA DOUGLAS WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LINE PLEASE AGAIN YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DIANA DOUGLAS FOR HEALTH ACT OF CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION HERE AND SPONSORSHIP OF SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT. ALMOST TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE DEDUCTIBLES MANY OF WHICH ARE IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND ON TOP OF THAT CALIFORNIANS WITH PRIVATE COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET LIMIT. WORKING FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET OR FACING DIFFICULT EXPENSIVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS TRACKING OR CRUEL TOWARD THE AMOUNT. THE CRUCIAL PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING IN THE ACCEPTING CARE. EXACTLY THREE SIXTY EIGHT WILL PLACE THE BURDEN ON HEALTH PLANS TO TRACK VEHICLE AMOUNT AND COMMUNICATE THEM TO THEIR OWN BELIEFS. A NEW FEDERAL ROLE WILL REQUIRE PLANS TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH CONSUMERS BUT STILL REQUIRES THE CONSUMER TO REQUEST THE INFORMATION. THAT WE PROPOSE SHIFTING THE BURDEN FROM THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE HEALTH PLANS THAT CONSUMERS FACING SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS ARE LEFT IN THE DARK. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR THOSE WHO LACK FINANCIAL LITERACY THE BURDEN SHOULDN'T FALL ON THEM TO HAVE TO HUNT DOWN THE INFORMATION. SB THREE SIXTY ABLE REQUIRE THE PLANS TO REGULARLY UPDATING BUT LIKE IF. SOMEONE RELEASED ALREADY RECEIVE CEO PETER EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT STATEMENTS WHICH INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION. AND WE ALSO ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS PROVIDED UPDATES FOR THE WHILE. WE APPRECIATE THE WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND CHAIRS FROM CORPORATE AMENDMENT THAT CLARIFIED THE TIMING OF NOTICE REQUIREMENTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE HEALTH PLANS AND TO CLARIFY THAT RELIEF WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO OPT OUT OF MAIL NOTICES. REQUEST ONLY ELECTRONIC UPDATE. WE DO BELIEVE THAT MALE NOTICES THAT THE DEFAULT OPTION ARE CRUCIAL TO MITIGATE EQUITY ISSUES FOR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE HIGH SPEED. INTERNET OR SMARTPHONE APP. THANK YOU AND THESE THREE WE ARE TO SPONSOR SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT RESPECT REQUEST YOUR I GOT. THANK YOU DAN DOUGLAS. NOW LET'S BRING CHEN FOR FROM THE WESTERN WEST CENTER ON FOR A LONG. GOOD AFTERNOON IS JENNIFER WHAT'S CENTER ON POP. CURRENTLY CONSUMER ARE TRUCK REQUIRED TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL THEIR HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES AND SELF CALCULATE WHEN THEY REACH THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM. FEW PEOPLE CAN EXPLAIN ALL OF THE COST SHARING REQUIREMENTS THAT THEIR PLANS WHEN CONSUMERS RECEIVE A BILL FROM A PROVIDER MANY OF THEM THEY OWE THE AMOUNT THEIR BUILD FORGE RATHER THAN ADEQUATE THEY HAVE ALREADY ACCRUED TOWARD THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM. THIS IS ASKING THOSE WITH THE LEAST KNOWLEDGE OF INDUSTRY PRACTICES INTERMENT TERMINOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES AND JUSTICE SOMEBODY WITH ALMOST TWO DECADES OF HEALTH ADVOCACY EXPERIENCE I STILL STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND THE BILLS THAT I GET FROM PROVIDERS AND UNDERSTAND. WHAT AND HOW I ACTUALLY- MORE OR- CONSUMERS ARE MOST LIKELY TO HIT THEIR- OUT OF POCKET. WHEN THEY HAVE HAD A MAJOR HEALTH EVENTS. SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT REQUIRING EMERGENCY CARE OR A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. IN THOSE STRESSFUL TIME KEEPING UP WITH ANY FINANCIAL MATTERS THE CHALLENGE. INITIAL BURDEN OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH PLAN POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS IS MORE THAN AND CONSUMERS CAN BEAR. IN ADDITION MANY LOW INCOME CONSUMERS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR CREDIT AS HAVING BAD CREDIT AND LIMITED RESOURCES CAN MEAN OUT MEAN LOSING OUT ON HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES PAYING HIGHER INTEREST. ONLY HAVING ACCESS THAT. SUBPRIME PRODUCTS LIKE PAYDAY LOANS. ALL TOO OFTEN THE CONSUMER WILL PAY A BILL FROM A PROVIDER EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT CERTAIN THAT THEY- THAT PHIL BECAUSE THEY FEAR WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEIR CREDIT. FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS EVEN IF THE OVER PAYMENT IS RETURNED BY THE PROVIDER WHICH IN ITSELF CAN BE A REAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE PROVIDER OFFICES ARE NOT SET UP TO PAY PEOPLE. MONEY THAT IS TIED UP IN HEALTH CARE BILLS NEEDS OTHER BILLS ARE NOT PAID. OR THEY FOREGO NEEDED SERVICES. INCLUDING FUTURE MEDICAL CARE. FOR CONSUMERS WHO HAVE MET THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OR OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUMS HERE IS LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER FOR THEM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. IN THE CASE OF THOSE WHO HIT THEIR OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM. THE REST OF THE CARE THEY RECEIVED THAT YEAR THREE. HOWEVER WITHOUT IT BEING COMMUNICATED THE CONSUMER MAY AVOID CARE ALL. TOGETHER AT PRECISELY THE TIME WHEN THEY MOST NEED IT AND WHEN IT FINALLY AFFORDABLE. EVER INCREASING DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUMS TRAIN CONSUMERS NOT TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED. THEY SHOULD BE INFORMED WHEN IT IS MOST ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THEM TO GET CARE. BECAUSE THE HEALTH PLAN AND SURE WOULD RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THE PROVIDERS THAT CONSPIRACIES THEY'RE IN THE BEST. POSITION TO TRACK HOW MUCH OF A DEDUCTIBLE AND OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUMS THAT CONSUMER. HAS ACCRUED. FOR THIS. WE RESET. ASK FOR YOUR I. AND THANK WITH THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD.

AND THE WILLINGNESS TO TAKE AMENDMENTS- SOME OF WHICH ARE HELPFUL- BE AMENDMENTS OVER GOING INTO THE BILL REQUIRING PAPER MAIL IS THE DEFAULT COMMUNICATION MATH MECHANISM. REQUIRE FURTHER ANALYSIS ON OUR PART- THEY DO SEEM TO BE MORE OF AN H. ISSUE FOR HMO MODEL PLANS ARE PPO MODEL PLANS- IF WE ON OUR IDE CAN DEVELOP SOME ALTERNATIVES WE LIKE THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORED TO- CONSIDER MORE STREAMLINED.

THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SEEING NONE- IT'S A SERUM. AND WHATNOT OKAY SO ALONE- I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT ACTUALLY- WELL THE OPPOSITION DID INDICATE THAT THEY WANTED A LONGER TIMELINE THAT ACTUALLY MANY PLANS. READY CAN PROVIDE THIS. AND THE FACT IS THAT I'D BE SURPRISED IF ANY PLAN TO ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY FINANCIALLY OPERATE WITH ACTUALLY HAVING THIS INFORMATION RATE THEIR FINGER TIPS. SO SINCE THEY DO TRACK INNOCENTLY- I NEED TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION TO TAKE ISSUES ABOUT HOW TO SHARE IT WITH OTHER MEMBERS.

ONE SO THE VOTE IS CURRENTLY EIGHT ONE WITH ONLY THE BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SEVERAL AMOUNT RIGHT- NEXT TIME IS GONNA BE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN S. B. TWO FIFTY BY MYSELF SO- CENTER EGGMAN I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO TAKE GO AHEAD TAKE THE CHAIR YOU CAN DO IT FROM I THINK FOR THAT TRY TO OPEN THE DESKTOP PROTOCOLS WHEN WE COME TO A MEMBER QUESTIONS I REALIZE GIVEN WHERE YOU'RE SITTING AND I'M ALSO MONITORING I WILL TRY TO SIGNAL WHO HAS HER. HANDS UP AND SO FORTH BUT TAKE IT AWAY CENTER OKAY THINK YOU'RE MUCH WELCOME CENTER PAN- PLEASE GO AHEAD AND PRESENT YOUR BILL S. B. TWO FIFTY THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN SB TWO FIFTY ADDRESSES INEFFICIENCIES IMPOSED BY HEALTH PLANS TO INCREASES ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THE LACE CARE REDUCES TIME SPENT ON PATIENT CARE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY PUBLISHED IN ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE FOUND THAT OUTPATIENT POSITION SPENT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THEIR TIME ON DIRECT CLINICAL FACE TO FACE TIME WITH THE PATIENTS AND ALMOST HALF OF THEIR TIME ON WHAT'S CALLED DESK. WORK AND EHR DOCUMENTATION. IN TWENTY EIGHT SAID PUBLISHED IN MESS FOUND THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN SPENT MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR TIME EACH DAY AND WHAT THEY CALL. DESKTOP MEDICINE. OTHER STUDIES HAVE FOUND THE 2250% OF A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TIME INVOLVED ACTIVITIES. WHICH MUSEUM COMPENSATED. RELATED TO THE PATIENTS THAT WEREN'T ACT EVEN SCHEDULED FOR THEM THAT DAY INCLUDING. TELEPHONE CALLS AND EMAILS FOR MINISTRY OF WORK. AS WE STRUGGLE WITH THE PRIMARY CARE SHOULD WORKFORCE SHORTAGES TOO MUCH CLINICIAN TIME. OVER HALF FOR MOORE'S CONSUME BY ADMINISTRATIVE WORK AND SPENT INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME WITH THEIR PATIENTS. SB TWO FIFTY IS ABOUT LEADING OUR PET DOCTOR SPEND. MORE TIME WITH PATIENTS AND LESS TIME WAITING TO HEAR FROM HEALTH PLANS. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO NEW PRACTICES BY HEALTH PLANS INSURERS THEY'LL EASE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR PATIENTS FREEING UP TIME EXPENSE WITH ULTIMATELY IMPROVES CARE FOR PATIENTS. NOW WHEN YOU SEE A POSITION HEALTH PLANS MAY REQUIRE THEIR AUTHORIZATION FIRST. FOR YOUR POSITION TO BE PAID FOR THE CARE THEY PROVIDE OR FOR PRESCRIPTION THAT MAY BE WRITTEN FOR IT TO BE COVERED A PROCESS KNOWN AS PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. THIS PROCESS IS USED TO REDUCE UTILIZATION OF CARE IDEALLY TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY CARE BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT ALSO INCREASES THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN TO RISKY RECEIVE A TICKER SERVICES ARE PRESCRIPTIONS. IN FACT ON AVERAGE EACH POSITION COMPLETE ABOUT TWENTY NINE POINT ONE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS PER WEEK. THE TAKE AN AVERAGE OF FOURTEEN POINT SIX HOURS TO PROCESS. PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS DELAY CARE ESPECIALLY FOR AFTER HOURS AND WEEKEND CARE THIS POSITIONS WAIT FOR APPROVALS AND HEALTH PLANS AS THEY ARE WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. SO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS. SB TWO FIFTY WOULD CREATE A GOLD CARD PROCESS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE A RECORD OF OBTAINING APPROVALS A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUEST AND HEALTH PLANS INSURERS. SO THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE GOOD ACTORS THE DEAR ONES WHO MAKE APPROPRIATE CHOICES. THE BILL REQUIRES THE PART MANAGED HEALTHCARE AND PART OF SURE IS TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY BASED ON CALCULATIONS IN THE BILL THAT WOULD QUALIFY PROVIDER FOR TWO YEARS OF DEEMED APPROVED STATUS. TO THE PROVIDER WOULD NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS FOR HIS OR HER PATIENTS THEIR BY TAKING UP VALUABLE PATIENT TIME. TIME WHEN A PHYSICIAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE A PATTERN OVER THE UTILIZING SERVICES. USING ORDERING UNNECESSARY SERVICES THEY SHOULD BE FREED FROM THE BURNS A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. THERE'S ALSO AN AUDIT PROCESS FROM IN THE BILL TO ALLOW HEALTH PLANS INSURERS TO CHECK. TO SEE IF THE PROVIDER STATUS SHOULD REMAIN. SB TWO FIFTY ALSO SET UP A PROCESS WHEREBY CERTAIN FACILITY BASED PROVIDERS CAN GET PAID THE FULL CONTRACTED RATE BY HEALTH PLANS INSURERS. FOR SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE CONTRACTED FACILITY WITHOUT HAVING TO BILL AND COLLECT COST SHARING FROM PATIENTS. WHO ARE RECOGNIZED INSURERS ALREADY HAVE STAFF AND SYSTEMS FOR COLLECTING PAYMENTS INCLUDING PREMIUMS. I THINK THE BURDEN OF COLLECTING COST SHARING PAYMENTS ON TO PHYSICIAN PRACTICES. REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE STAFF DUPLICATE THE SAME FUNCTION OF PAYMENT COLLECTION WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF SCALE AND LIKELY LESS EFFICIENCY AND GREATER EXPENSE TO DO THE SAME FUNCTIONS. BOTH OF THESE PRACTICES TOGETHER WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD EASING BURDENS ON PROVIDERS AND PTIENTS AVOID DELAYS IN CARE AND DIRECTING RESOURCES TO PRACTICES. THAT IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. I AM ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE AMENDMENTS THOUGH CLEAR FIND IMPROVE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILLS DESCRIBED AN ANALYSIS. A MOCK UP IS ALSO BEEN PROVIDED THE MAN IS CLARIFIED DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE COST SHARING COLLECTIONS REQUIRED IN THE BILL IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO CONTRACTING PROVIDERS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED AT IN NETWORK FACILITIES. I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BRIAN MARTY FROM THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS IN THE GALLERY. AND THEN I'LL ALSO INTRODUCE DR MASER WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING FROM THE PHONE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND START WITH THE FIRST WITNESS IN THE GALLERY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BRANDON MARCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION PROUD SPONSOR OF THE BILL- BECAUSE OF LIMITED TIME I'M GOING TO YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME TO DR MASER ON THE TELEPHONE. BUT HAPPY HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANYBODY ELSE IN THE GALLERY. OKAY THEN WILL PLEASE GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR THE WITNESS THERE. YES WE CAN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR CHAD MAYES ARE SAN DIEGO OTOLARYNGOLOGY IS REPRESENTING THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. POSITION PRACTICES AND NOT BEEN IMMUNE TO THE ECONOMIC DEVASTATION OF THE NINETEEN ON THE ONLY 30% DECREASE IN INPATIENT BEDS THAT WITH PPPS SAFETY PROTOCOLS COUPLED WITH EVER INCREASING NONCLINICAL COSTLY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS INCLUDING SELLING APPLES AND BURDENSOME PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IMPACTING TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE AND CONFUSING PATIENTS TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. AND UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITIES WE NEED TO HELP MAKE PRACTICES FREE TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT THE BODIES FINALLY ACCESS TO CARE I JUST STARTED WRITING THE CONFUSION PATIENTS SPACE AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR OWN HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE S. B. TWO FIFTY DOES THIS BY TACKLING TWO BIG OBSTACLES TO THAT GOAL PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND BILLING FOR PATIENT COST SHARING. IN A SURVEY SHOWS THAT PROVIDERS AVERAGE THIRTY THREE FIRE AUTHORIZATIONS ARE WE CONSUMING NEARLY TWO WORKING DAYS EVERY WEEK 90% REPORTED THE GROWING FIRE AUTHORIZATION INTERFERE WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE AND HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES BHAIRAB PROPERTIES CONTRIBUTE TO ADVERSE EVENT THAT THE WASTE TREATMENT RESULTED PATIENTS ABANDONING CARE ALTOGETHER. EVEN PHYSICIANS MAY SURRENDER TO THE ON REASONABLE AUTHORIZATION AND I OKAY I'M SO FRUSTRATED TRYING TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR PATIENTS SO CUMBERSOME INTERRUPTED BUSINESS PROCESS. SB TWO FIFTY WORK WITHIN CONSTRAINTS OF UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT RELATING PHYSICIANS WITH A PROVEN RECORD OF APPROPRIATE UTILIZATION FROM HAVING TO FILE FIREFOX. WITH A FEW YEARS. KNOW WHETHER A CONTRACT POSITION REQUIRE GENERALLY ARE WE ARE A FEW AND RARELY DID NOT. SUCH PROVIDERS BE GROW REALLY BY FROM COMP FIVE THE MAN. SUBJECT TO. RE THIS APPROACH ALLOWS TO TIME ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICE IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. ALLOWING MORE TO PAY CARE. DELAYS IN CARE AND REDUCING CALL THIS IS A PRACTICES EVEN PAY SHOULD BY RE OF THE- REVIEWS STATE OF OFFICE. I'M MEDICAL DIRECTORS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OF OUR BUYERS SEEKING AUTHORIZATIONS THAT MAY NOT MEET CLINICAL CRITERIA. THE SECOND ISSUE IS COLLECTION OF PATIENT COST SHARING FACILITY SETTINGS BY REQUIRING PLAYERS TO COLLECT IN RALEIGH CARSHARING AMOUNTS DIRECTLY. BASED ON AGREEMENTS PLANS MAKE WITH THE ENROLLEE. POSITIONS YOU SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES COLLECTING COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES TO PATIENT CARE ALREADY PROVIDED. THROWING HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PRODUCT AMPLIFY THE PROBLEM. PATIENTS GET CONFUSED AS WHAT WHEN THEY RECEIVE BILLS FOR DEDUCTIBLES AND COST SHARING FROM ONE OR SEVERAL DOCTORS RESULTING IN THE LATE OR NO PAYMENTS. PHONE CALLED DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS CORRECT NATIONWIDE THEIR PLAN IS ASKING THE BANK. ACOSTA PRACTICE IS ATTEMPTING TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DO THEM WITH YOUR APPROVAL. THIS BURDENS PRACTICES WHICH OUGHT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT PROVISION OF CARE BUT INSTEAD END UP SERVING AS EXPLAINERS AND COLLECTORS OF YEAH. UNMOUNTED THERE'S A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PAIR AND THE INSURER AND PURCHASE YOUR INSURANCE MARKETS ARE NOT THE POSITION. SB TWO FIFTY SIMPLIFY THINGS FOR PATIENTS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BILLS THE PATIENT RECEIVED FOR POSITION SERVICES TO A SINGLE PAYER FROM THEIR PLAN. I THINK THE BILL FROM THEIR PLAN AND ONE STOP SHOPPING TO CALL FOR ANY CLARIFICATION OF CONTRACTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. IT FREES UP PRACTICE RESOURCES TO DEDICATE MORE TIME TO DELIVERY PATIENT CARE. AND HELPS PRACTICES REMAIN VIABLE IT REDUCES PHYSICIAN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS SIMPLIFIES BILLING ON QUESTIONS ABOUT BILLING FOR PATIENTS. AND CAN RESULT IN OVERALL COST REDUCTION CARE. I'M HERE TO AN ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AS A FRIEND AND MARK. I RESPECTFUL ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON IMPORT EASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ANYTHING BEFORE WE GO. FOR WHEN IS DR PAN CLEAR. ISSUE A THE A MAN. YES ACTUALLY- SORRY WAS IN MY NOTES ABOUT IT BUT I THINK WE AREN'T ACTUALLY TAKING AMENDMENTS RIGHT HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE CELL.

AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN SUPPORT PLEASE CONTINUE MADAM CHAIR OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO OPPOSITION AND THE SUPPORT SIDE I'D TALK FOR FOUR MINUTES SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE WE- ALLOW THE OPPOSITION TO HAVE. THAT AMOUNT OF TIME SO I WILL RUN MY TIMER AS YOU GO I UNDERSTAND THERE'S OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATOR EGGMAN. THIS IS NICKEL RESULTS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. AND WE'RE REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. TWO FIFTY- THE BILL CONTAINS MULTIPLE MAJOR PROVISIONS- THAT WE BELIEVE ARE VERY PROBLEMATIC IN ALL THE ADDRESSING THE PROVISION RELATED CITY PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PIECE. MEMBERS IN OUR VIEW THE PRIOR OFF PROVISION OF THIS BILL INSTRUCTS THE ABILITY OF MY MEMBERS TO APPLY COMMON SENSE CHECKS AND BALANCES THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY WORK TO ENSURE THAT A RELEASE ARE GETTING THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME AT THE RIGHT LOCATION IN PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS KEY TO THAT WORK. IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS. MANY HEALTH PLANS ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING THEIR OWN ENHANCE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROGRAMS TO HELP EASE THE BURDEN ON PROVIDERS AND ENROLLEES. AND DURING THE PANDEMIC PLANS OF STREAMLINED PROCESS EVEN FURTHER IN SOME CASES EVEN SUSPENDING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. UNFORTUNATELY SIZE FITS ALL MANDATE THAT IS OUTLINED IN SB TWO FIFTY WILL DISRUPT THOSE EFFORTS. THE SCOPE OF SB TWO FIFTY IS PARTICULARLY ALARMING. THE BILL GIVES SPECIFIED PROVIDERS ARE FREE PASS FOR MANY CHECKS AND BALANCES FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. WITHOUT ANY ABILITY FOR THE HEALTH PLAN TO AUDIT- DURING THOSE TWO YEARS. AT THE END OF THE TWO YEAR PERIOD HEALTH PLANS WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED TO REVIEW A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY CASES ACROSS ALL PRODUCT TYPES. AND WE THIS IS HARDLY A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR ENROLLEES ARE RECEIVING THE RIGHT CARE- UNDER TWO FIFTY PRIOR AUTH IS WAIVED FOR ALL SERVICES. AND DRUGS RENDERED BY THE PROVIDER. THIS WAIVER WULD APPLY EVEN SERVICES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RISK F FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE OR NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS. SB TWO FIFTY TAKES NO STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE FRAUDULENT WASTEFUL CARE DOES NOT INCREASE DURING THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD. ALSO CONTRARY TO THE ASSERTIONS OF THE SUPPORTERS- SB TWO FIFTY ACTUALLY INCREASES THE ADMINISTRATION AND HEALTH CARE BY CREATING A NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT IS BURDENSOME ON BOTH HEALTH PLANS AND OUR PROVIDER PARTNERS. WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY IS NOT UNANIMOUSLY. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THIS MEASURE COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY IS COLLECTIVELY GRAPPLING WITH THE ECHO OF NINETEEN PANDEMIC. BY AND WE FEEL THAT EXCESSIVE LEGISLATION AT THIS TIME- IS UNHELPFUL FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POST THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. YEAH WE WERE THE FIRST IN THE GALLERY FOR ON THE PHONE. OKAY ON THE PHONE THEN ANNA AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES LEFT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR STEPHANIE WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES REGRETTABLY WE ARE HERE TO STAY IN OPPOSITION I WOULD ECHO MY COLLEAGUES REMARKS REGARDING SECTION ONE OF THE BILL THAT DEALS WITH PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. AND PROTECTION TO WHAT SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTING THE CO PAYS DEDUCTIBLES AND COST SHARING PROVIDERS TO PLAN. WEEK WE HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS AS WE NOTED IN OUR LETTER THAT YOU GOT THE SENATE FOUNDATIONAL SHIFT IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OPERATES MOST CONSUMERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS WITH A MONTHLY PREMIUM PAYMENTS ARE DUE TO THE HEALTH PLANNER INSURER AND COST SHARING COPAYS DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE OR GO DIRECTLY TO THE PROVIDERS HERE. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO FINALLY TALK ABOUT PRACTICE BY NOW REQUIRING PLANS TO REIMBURSE HOSPITAL BASED PHYSICIANS AT A 100% AND COLLECT THE PATIENT COST SHARING ON THE BACKEND DIRECTLY FROM THE PATIENT. THIS IS SPECIFICALLY PROBLEMATIC AS OUR PROVIDER RATE CONTRACTS INCLUDE ADMINISTRATIVE FEET THE CURRENT BILLING AND COLLECTIONS AND POSSIBLY IN ADDITION ARE NO LONGER GOING TO BE TASKED WITH THAT RESPONSIBILITY WE NEED TO RE OPEN ALL OF OUR CONTRACT THAT JUST READ BASED ON THE CHANGE. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE CHANGE WOULD BE FACTORED INTO THE CURRENT SYSTEM HOW THE NON COLLECTIBLE FACT THAT THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO CALCULATIONS THE NON COLLECTIBLE FACTOR IN THE RATE DEVELOPMENT. NOW TAT THE PROHIBITS PLANTS FROM TURNING AND- YOU'RE INSURED FOR NON PAYMENT OF COST SHARING AND SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS HOW THEY CAN COLLECT THE PAYMENT WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN COLLECTIONS. WITH THE REDUCTION IN COLLECTIONS GIVEN PLANS INSURERS WILL BE CHASING THE MONEY MONTH AFTER THE FACT FIRST OF MANY HOSPITAL DAYS AFTER COLLECTED PRIOR TO THE POINT OF SERVICE. ANOTHER ISSUE OF CONCERN IS THAT THE BILL ONLY IMPACTS HE COMMERCIAL MARKET THAT MEANS THAT PROVIDERS WOULD STILL NEED TO HAVE A COLLECTION SYSTEM IN PLACE AND THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THE COST YEAR ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS. MEDICARE. MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS. OCULAR THEY WOULD HAVE TO. ON THE FACILITY. THAT WHICH ALTHOUGH THE- DOES THE REALLY. IN A- SAVINGS AND- BETTER MARKET SYSTEM PRODUCTIVE ACTUALLY ACT. TO THE CHIEF. YOU WILL NOW HAVE LOCAL INTO THE DOING THE SAME WORK I'M GOOD TO ASK YOU TO ALL THE- WRAP UP IF YOU COULD. OF COURSE OF COURSE. I'M OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE MOST RECENT ARE CHANGING OPERATIONAL DATE UNTIL THAT MAY CAUSE SOME CONFUSION AND FOR THE- REASONS WE ARE. ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY NOW IF WE CAN GO TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY TWO IF IT THE ANYBODY. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF. SB TWO FIFTY. SEEING NOBODY THERE. MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE QUEUE THE LINE FOR PEOPLE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT FOR PIC PLEASE. ARRIVE OPPOSITION- SB TWO FIFTY. HENLEY GERMAN FURIN OPPOSITION OF SB TWO FIFTY PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO.

YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR- I APOLOGIZE THAT THIS CALL LONDON ABOUT CALIFORNIANS WILL THERAPY ASSOCIATION WE ARE ACTUALLY SUPPORT OF THE BILL JUST ONE REGISTER THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I COULD TRY FOR OTHER OPPOSITION MODERATOR. BUT ONE CHAMPION OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO WILL MOVE TO NUMBER FORTY SIX FORTY SIX WEEKS AGO AT. THE MANAGER MEMBERS JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON THE APP AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS- WOULD ECHO COMIC WITH CAPTAIN OUTLOOK WE ARE CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS CALLER PLEASE.

THEN ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWO FIFTY PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS NOW AND I'LL JUST SAY. DR PAN I APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND I KNOW. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT AT THIS WHERE YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS- BUT I CAN I KNOW THIS WILL STREAMLINE THINGS FOR PHYSICIANS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU AS A AS A CARE GIVER IT ALSO STREAM THINGS STREAMLINE THINGS FOR FAMILIES. HI I CAN'T TELL YOU HAVE TO HAVING A SICK PERSON IN YOUR FAMILY I CAN'T TELL YOU THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO PROVIDE THE RESERVATIONS PRIOR APPROVALS AND THEN TO GET THE APPOINTMENT. IT IS HARD ENOGH TO HAVE SOME PRISON HEALTH CARE ISSUES WITHOUT HAVING TO STRUGGLE THROUGH THE INSURANCE PROCESS AS WELL SO ANYTHING THAT STREAMLINES I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA WE SEE IF THERE'S ANY. OTHER MEMBERS IN THE ROOM. XIFAXAN A REVIEW FOR. THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR GIVING THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT HOW DOCTOR BRENNER HAS ARE YOU SPEND QUALITY TIME DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE WITH ME SO I APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU TECH TO EDUCATE ME AND WALKING THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS ALL SEVERAL OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION OF ONE BEING THAT- AND I WANT TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTSON PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REFORMS- ARE CAUSING THE POSSIBILITY OF FRAUD AND ABUSE AND JUGGLING ON TRACK FOR TWO YEARS- BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE AUDITS. CAN YOU DRESS UP FOR ME PLEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO BEFORE- A PHYSICIAN CAN GET- THIS- COCOA CALLED THE GOLD CARD OR THE- THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY PROVE THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAVE NOT- THE DATE-% BASICALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE GETTING HIGH RATES OF APPROVAL WITH INSTANT TWO STANDARD DEVIATIONS SO WITH OUR STATE. WITHIN THE NORM THEY HAD THAT SHOW THAT THEY ARE GOOD ACTORS THAT THEY'RE NOT ONES TO ENTER PROBABLY ORDER- PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS OR- PERFORM SERVICES THAT HAVE REQUIRED. A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM THE PLANNED SO THEY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE FIRST THAT THEY ARE- YEAH RESPONSIBLE THAT THERE AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY DON'T GET THIS RIGHT SO NOW IT'S THE FAN CAN CONTINUE CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE. AND THEN AGAIN AFTER THE TWO YEARS THE PLAN CAN LOOK AGAIN AND SEE WHAT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS. AND CERTAINLY UP PLANS- THROUGH THE CLAIMS DATA ACTUALLY COLLECT A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE PHYSICIANS A CONTRACT WITH- DAY AND- SO IT IS SO THEY DO HAVE THE OPTION TO AUDIT. AS WELL AND THEY CAN ALSO LOOK AT THOSE PATTERNS AND THEY CAN COME BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH HE ORIGINALLY WERE A GOOD ACTOR YOUR NOW. SOME OF YOUR PORTANTINO CLAIMS PATTERNS LOOK- KIND OF THE- SERVING IN WE DID AN AUDIT WE FOUND THAT THERE'S PATTERNS THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO NOW MONITOR YOU AND NOW YOU'RE BACK ON PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. SO THERE IS THIS MECHANISM IN PLACE. BECAUSE A PHYSICIAN HAVE TO DENNIS IT WOULD NOT BE ANY PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. RIGHT AND THERE'S A PLACE FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS BUT I THINK AS A- SERVER ADMIN MENTIONED AND ALSO SOMETHING. FOR MY COLLEAGUES- WHEN WE USE IT IN A BLANK AWAY. IT STOPS BEING A TOOL TO. REDUCE FRAUD AND INAPPROPRIATE ORDERING IT. NOW BECOMES ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT ACTUALLY INHIBITS PEOPLE FROM GETTING CARE. AND ACTUALLY AND EVEN THE LAZY CARE. THANK YOU THERE'S ONE MORE- ISSUE THAT I WANT TO DRESS AS I HEARD SOME OF THE OPPOSITION STATE AND JUST WANT TO GET YOUR- FEEDBACK ON THIS THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THAT THE REFORM A SHIFTING THAT COST SHARING COLLECTION RESPONSIBLY TO THE HEALTH PLANS. ARE WILL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO COLLECT. AT EIGHT PM ON THE BACKEND CAN YOU SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE PLACED HER WELL FIRST OF ALL IF- COLLECTING IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR A PHYSICIAN'S PRACTICE VERSUS THE PLAN THAT ACTUALLY IS A NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS HAVE TO COLLECT PAYMENTS INCLUDING PREMIUMS. FROM PEOPLE SO IN OTHER WORDS-THEY HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO COLLECT PAYMENTS FROM- THEIR BENEFICIARIES- SO LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND. WHEN WE THEN. PUSH THAT ON TO THE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT ACTUALLY DOES MORE FRAGMENTATION WRITERS OFTENTIMES MORE CONFUSION SO INSTEAD OF GETTING ONE. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FROM YOUR PLAN YOU NOW GET BECAUSE YOU SAW TWO DIFFERENT DOCTORS TO GET TWO DIFFERENT STATEMENTS TO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE CALLING YOU TRYING TO CHASE YOU DOWN FOR YOUR PAYMENT. AND IN FACT IN MANY TIMES- PHYSICIANS. THIS GIVE UP TO COLLECT THE COST SHARE- BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO ADMINISTRATIVELY COSTLY AND DIFFICULT AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE TO SPEND WHICH IS BY THE WAY THE LESS EFFICIENT WHEN YOU'RE SMALLER SCALE SO THE PLAN HAS A LARGER. SCALE TO BILL DO THE STUDENTS BY THE NORMAL COURSE OF USINESS ANYWAY WHEN EXPECTING TO DO ANYTHING. THEY DON'T. ALREADY DO WE JUST COLLECT MONEY. FROM PEOPLE OUT FROM FROM BENEFICIARIES. SO I THINK THAT IS AGAIN A WAY TO SIMPLIFY STREAMLINE AND REALLY ACTIONS MORE ON THE PATIENT AND- IN TERMS OF LESS CONFUSION TOO BECAUSE THEY WILL SEE MULTIPLE PROVIDERS AND THEN EACH PROVIDER IF THERE HAD EXPECTING COLLECTOR OWN COST SHARED INTO GOING TO GET. INDIVIDUAL LITTLE THINGS. AND SOMETIMES THERE'S CONFUSION ABOUT. DIFFERENT THINGS ESPECIALLY YEAH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT CAPS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND SO FORTH- EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON AT THE PROVIDERS TRYING TO COLLECT THE- CASHIER BUT THEN THE LARGER ONE IS OF COURSE. MANAGED BY THE PLANET SATURN SL I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE. FOR PLANS TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT THESE FUNCTIONS IN ASKING INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS TO IRISH ALSO MENTIONED THAT- THE OPPOSITION MENTION FOR EXAMPLE MEDIC CAL. THOSE OF US TO KNOW MEDIC HOUSE- THERE'S VERY MINIMAL COST SHARING INVOLVED IN ACCOUNT FACT THAT. ZERO YOU INTO IT AND SO- I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL. BURDEN ON THAT THAT AND- THANK YOU AND I JUST HAVE ONE. YOU PER ADDRESS IT BECAME SHARE THE INPUT. TIMELINE SURE- SO AGAIN THIS IS- THE IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE IS SO BASICALLY- I WANT TO GET THROUGH THE NEMESIS HERE SO BASICALLY OF I SHOULD ALSO MENTION BY THE WAY- SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- GIVING THEM UNTIL DO YOU MAY SEE A CD I UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO DEVELOP THEIR METHODOLOGY AND THEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS- WHEN. THEY ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT ME THESE THESE ITEMS I SHOULD MENTION THAT- FUND OPPOSITION POINTS IS THAT WHAT WE'RE BUILT IN COLLECTION COSTS AT CENTER AND TO OUR CONTRACTS WELL IF THIS BILL PASSES AND IS SIGNED INTO LAW IT WILL BE TIME FOR THEM TO RE NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS AND- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PLANS DO WITH PHYSICIANS. YOU KNOW THEY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONTRACTS. YEAH I SAID ALL THE TIME BUT AT LEAST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- SO THAT THEY COULD OFTEN MAKE DEPENDING ON CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO EARLY THAT WOULD BE A POINT OF- RE NEGOTIATION. WITH WITH PLANS- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT WOULD ALREADY DOING A LOT OF RENEGOTIATION RELATED TO COVE IT WITH PLANS AND PAYMENTS AND SO FORTH- TO TRY TO DRESS ME THE SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH A CRISIS AS WELL. PRESHEAF THE DETAILED EXPLANATION THAT WILL BE ALL THANK YOU. SENATE ROTH- THANK YOU- I GUESS SO MELCHER. OF YOU KNOW I TOOK A LOOK AT THIS AND I WILL I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M DOING WHEN I VOTE TO AND TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN EXPLAIN MY POSITION TO THOSE WHO. MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL IN THE DISTRICT OR OTHERWISE OR CERTAINLY THOSE WHO HAVE OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL AND IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE REAL RELATIONSHIP HERE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH INSURANCE IS BETWEEN THE PATIENT TO CONSUMER AND THE PLAN WITH A HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN IS SECURED. AND THEN WELL THERE BE MAYBE ISSUES- EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL THAT NEED TO BE WORKED ON AND WORKED OUT AS IT MOVES OUT OF THIS CHAMBER TO. OF THE OTHER CHAMBER AND TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK FOR SIGNATURE- IT SEEMED TO ME AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT IT CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE IS THE AUTHOR INDICATED FOR THE PLAN TO LOOK TO. THE CONTRACT BENEFICIARY. FOR THE PAYMENT OF- DEDUCTIBLE OR WHATEVER AND NOT TO TRY TO CHASE DOWN. INDIVIDUAL PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS WHO WERE ATTEMPTING SIMPLY TO ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE SERVICE- UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THAT- OF THAT HEALTH PLAN SO I'LL BE VOTING I TODAY AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL AND- THANK YOU OTHER FOR PURSUING IT. THANK YOU CENTER. SEEING NO FURTHER IS THERE A CERTAIN. CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU ARE ON A BANK- THE MEASURE FOR WATER IN THIS BILL AND HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF IT AND I AGREE THAT- PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS TO HAVE THEIR PLACE IN MADISON AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IS BEGRUDGING THE HEALTH PLANS FROM HAVING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS BUT ON THE CIVIC THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR AND I THINK WHAT USED TO BE THE EXCEPTION IS. A TIMES INCREASINGLY BECOMING THE RULE- AND WE'VE SEEN- WHAT THEY CAN DO SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY RECALL COLLEAGUES A FEW YEARS AGO AND LEGISLATION TO AND AMONG OTHER THINGS AND- PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR PROP AND PAP ANTI HIV. OR AIDS OR HIV PREVENTION DRUGS. WERE WE WERE SEEING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SO. WHICH OF THE LADY AND HAVING. THIS MEDICINE CAN ACTUALLY MEAN YOU GET HIV SO OVER THE DOCTOR DETERMINES THAT YOU ARE AT RISK FOR HIV THEY WANT TO GET YOU ON PROP IMMEDIATELY. AND THEN AS A ONE MONTH OR TWO MONTHS LATER FIGHT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY. THERE WERE THERE EVEN WAS EVEN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS TRYING TO IMPOSE A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. FOR PAT WHICH IS WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED AND YOU MUST TAKE THE MEDICINES. STARTING WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND THE SOONER THE BETTER. AND SO. THE OF THE X. THAT WE'VE SEEN. I HAD A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FROM MY DOCTOR FOR CONDITION I HAVE PRESCRIBED PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE MEDICINE. IMMEDIATELY OF INSURANCE COMPANY REJECTED THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND SAID I HAD A STORE ON A COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE MEDICINE THAT I WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO TAKE. MY DAUGHTER TO SPEND HOURS. ON THE PHONE ESCALATING- UNTIL HE FOUND A POSITION. WORKING FOR THE PLAN HE SAID OF COURSE HE SHOULD GET THOSE. ON MEDICINE. SERVICES PLAYING OUT EVERY DAY AND I HAD THIS LEGISLATION TAKES A REALLY BALANCED APPROACH OF A PHYSICIAN'S. BETTER YOU'RE BEING REASONABLE AND NOT BEING- BUSIVE THAN THEY CAN OPERATE IN A STREAMLINED WAY AND NOT BE CONSTANTLY SECOND GUESSED. IN THEIR. JUDGEMENTS FIRES IN IDAHO. WITH THAT THE EMOTION SILVA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE DR PAN THANK YOU I JUST WANNA CONFIRM I DO NOT SEE ANY RAISE YOUR HANDS BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO CAN SEE IT YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE CAN SO- ANYONE ON REMOTELY WANT TO SEE ANYTHING DON'T SEE ANYONE JUST WANNA CONFIRM. THANK YOU I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT- MET CENTER AGONUM EGGMAN- THIS IS REALLY ABOUT- TRYING TO REDUCE INEFFICIENCIES- LET'S HAVE THE BLUETOOTH CONFUSION FOR PATIENTS LET'S HAVE DOCTOR BILLS AND A LITTLE MORE TIME ACTUALLY MEETING WITH THEIR PATIENTS- I SIMPLY WANT TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW THERE'S A PLACE FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION WE'RE NOT SAYING WE WANT TO LIMITED PRIORITIZATION WE'D CERTAINLY WANT TO BE SURE PEOPLE GET THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME- THAT E DO NOT WANT TO HAVE INAPPROPRIATE CARE SO CERTAINLY WANT TO. WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IF THERE'S BETTER WAYS TO GO ABOUT DOING IT MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND UNDERLYING THIS BILL I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THAT IF SOMEONE'S BEEN. A YOU KNOW BEEN A GOOD ACTORS ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING- LET'S NOT MAKE THEM KEEP HAVING TO GO THROUGH HOOPS AND HOOPS AND HOOPS JUST TO TRY TO DELIVER THE RIGHT CARE TO PATIENTS LET'S NOT MAKE PATIENTS HAVE TO WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT SO THEY CAN RECEIVE THE RIGHT CARE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE THANK YOU.

WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IF CHELSEA MARTINEZ AS A MOTHER OF TWO IN THE NORTH BAY. WHO HAS RECEIVED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FROM KAISER AND FROM OTHER PROVIDERS. AND SUSAN WHITNEY WHO IS A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST. FROM BAKERSFIELD W. TESTIFIED OF WERE ALSO JOINED NOT FOR TESTIMONY ABOUT FOR MY ANSWERING POTENTIAL QUESTIONS BY A PAUL KUMAR WHO'S WITH OUR SPONSORS THE NATIONAL UNION. OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WE NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO IN SUPPORT- SO MODERATOR CAN BRING ON THE LINE THE FIRST CHELSEA MARTINEZ. AND THEN FOLLOWED BY SUSAN WHITNEY EACH WITNESS YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES TO TESTIFY. SO FIRST LET'S BEGIN WITH CHELSEA MARTINEZ- HI MY NAME IS CHELSEA I'M THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD MOTHER OF TWO. I AM DIAGNOSED WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER I THANK NINETY ONE I BECAME A PATIENT OF HAVE BEEN AROUND TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. HI THERE FOR ONE ON ONE THERAPY I WOULD TYPICALLY SIXTY BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS SOMETIMES LONGER. WAIT THAT LONG I DID NOT GET BETTER IN FACT IT MADE THINGS MUCH WORSE FOR ME. WHENEVER I WOULD MEET WITH A THERAPIST AFTER SUCH A LONG BREAK I WOULD HAVE TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF IN TWENTY THREE. I WOULD HAVE TO RE OPEN MY ROOM EVERY TIME AND I. HAD NO GUIDANCE ON HOW TO KILL THEM. THE FIRST MINUTES COULD BE PICKING UP. AT TAKEN UP BY RE INTRODUCING MYSELF AND PARLIAMENTARY. AND IT WAS ALMOST NO TIME BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN CURRENTLY IN MY LIFE AND CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TIME. TO HELP YOU MANAGE ALL THE EMOTIONS THE TRAUMA BY COULD JUST IT. AFTER THE SESSION MY CLASS BECAME MOST OF. I WOULD EXPECTED AT THAT THE MOVIES. HOURS SOMETIMES DAYS. COULD RECALL IN ABOUT IT. I STARTED CONTENT. WITH I'M A FROM THE DAY BASIS. WHEN I WAS THIRTY I STARTED PAYING OF POCKET TO GET THEIR PETS OUT OF HI THERE WHICH CREATED EXTREME HARDSHIP MY AT THE TIME. THANK AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET WITH ABOUT LINE HILL. THE FIRST SIX WEEKS HAVE AT LEAST WEEK PARENT I CRITICAL ON HERE. HI I HAVEN'T WITH THE AS THE FIRST TIME BUT BY SAYING OF MY TRAUMA COMES BACK. WE REACH OUT TO MAKE THEIR INDEPENDENT CARE THAT I. TO LOOK THROUGH IT. EVEN THAT I HAVE. TO CARE WHEN I IT MOST ME FEEL EIGHT TO DEAL MY- I WHAT THE PHRASE HOW. I ABLE TO MOVE ON WITH THE WHITE FAMILY COMP AND MORE DID NOT OWN LIFE. BUT WHAT PROPER TREAT CAN DO PEOPLE. ANYTHING LIKE THAT. HOME I THANK YOU FOR TAKING AFTER ON WHY IT. FOR MUCH. AND COUNTY OTHERS. THANK YOU THREE- JUST MARTINEZ NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO WHITNEY. CAN YOU HEAR ME A YES PLEASE BEGIN. HI AM PLEASED WHITNEY- LICENSE IN MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST THAT KIND BECAUSE AND OF WORKED FOR A THIRTY YEARS TREATING PATIENTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. PRIMARILY CHILDREN TEENS AND FAMILIES OVER MY CAREER LOCATION BY TREATED HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS THAT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER SB TWO TWO ONE. THE EXPERIENCE MISS MARTINEZ JUST DESCRIBED IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT CLINICAL STUDIES TELL US ABOUT TREATING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. PATIENTS AREN'T SEEN FREQUENTLY ENOUGH THEY OFTEN DON'T GET BETTER. THE TREAD WATER IN THEIR OWN. SOMETIMES FOR YEARS. TOO OFTEN THEIR ILLNESSES GROW WORSE WITH INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY LONGER RECOVERY TIME MORE TRIPS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND MORE COSTLY CARE. THAT'S WHY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION PRACTICE GUIDELINES RECOMMEND THAT PATIENTS BE TREATED WEEKLY FOR MANY COMMON DIAGNOSES SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND PTSD. ESPECIALLY AT THE ONSET OF THEIR CARE. IF PEOPLE TIME FOLLOW UP CARE MANY MAKE PROGRESS IN RELATIVELY SHORT TIME FRAME STABILIZER AND GRADUATE TO LESS INTENSIVE TREATMENT. UNFORTUNATELY MANY PATIENTS DO NOT RECEIVE FREQUENT ENOUGH FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT. IN MY CLINIC PATIENTS WITH DIAGNOSES LIKE DEPRESSION ANXIETY BIPOLAR DISORDER AND PTSD TYPICALLY WAIT FOUR TO EIGHT WEEKS OR MORE BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE STATE HI THERE CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST HMO. AND IT'S GETTING WORSE TO THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR ITS BY THE PANDEMIC. FLU CALL IN CURRENT REGULATIONS GENERALLY FOCUSES HEALTH PLANS ATTENTION ON TIMELY ACCESS TO INITIAL APPOINTMENT BUT NOT TO FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS WITH THE PREDICTABLE RESULT AT HEALTH PLANS LIKE KAISER DON'T PRIORITIZE THE LATTER. THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT SB TWO TO ONE IT PASSED IT WILL HELP FOCUS HEALTH PLANS ON THE CRITICAL NEED FOR TIMELY FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE THE CARE THEY. NEED PAGE EVERYTHING. THANK YOU. THANKS VERY FOR YOUR CUSTOMER- WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO TO ONE OF BEGINNING IN THE GALLERY SEEN ON THE GALLERY LET'S MOVE TO ROOM% TWENTY FORTY SEVEN NO ONE ROOM TWENTY FORTY- LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES WAITING- VIA TESTIFIED VIA TELECONFERENCE ORBIS MODERATOR WE PLEASE PROMPT INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO TWO ONE.

I DO WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND AGREE SENATE SHARING ACT THAT THE KREMLIN. CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH- IT'S QUITE A- HELLO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT SB TWENTY ONE. ONE FIVE IT'S ALL APPROACH TO GET A FOLLOW UP. WITHIN TEN DAYS. THEY DID NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDER MANY CHALLENGES THAT THE PRESIDENT SHALL. THE TYPICALLY THIS BILL DOES NOT CONSIDER REAL PEOPLE HE MY- I'M NOT HAD A CALL THAT WILL TEN CRIME. SAMPLING INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT FEEL LIKE PROVIDER THE A PHOTO DETECT WOULD BE INTO THE-MAKING THE THAT THE UPON THEIR PERSONAL. BY WEEKLY OR MONTHLY SO ARE.

PRETTY RECENTLY- RESPECTABLE ANOTHER IRAQI PEOPLE ANYWAY AND ACCORDING TO WORK WITH THE OPERA BONTA THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK THANK YOU KNOW SPRING ON STEPHANIE. WADKINS PLEASE. REMEMBER ONE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT- OUR CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL SEEKING TO CODIFY A PORTION OF THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. OPINION YOU CAN APPRECIATE REGULATIONS THEY'RE REALLY INTENDED TO GIVE LIFE TO THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAX. THESE GUIDELINES ARE MORE LIKE LIVING BREATHING DOCUMENTS THAT ALLOW REGULATORY OVERSIGHT TO FALL THIS INDUSTRY'S CHANGING GROW. AS EXAMPLE COMMITTEE IS A VALUE WAITING INTERVIEWING THEIR CURRENT REGULATORY TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. AS THE GDI SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN THEY CHOSE INCORPORATED DIGITAL ACCESS STANDARDS WHICH WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL GEO ACTION STANDARDS THAT EXISTED. AT LEAST THIRTY CODIFY THE STANDARDS INTO LAW IT LIMITS THE OVERSIGHT AND FLEXIBILITY THE REGULATORS CURRENTLY USED TO ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY ARISE BY SIGNIFICANTLY HINDERING THEIR ABILITY TO BE NIMBLE. AND ADDRESS OVERSIGHT ISSUES QUICKLY SB WOULD NOW BE REQUIRED TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS NO MATTER HOW INSIGNIFICANT OUR TECHNICAL THEY MIGHT BE. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR A GREAT DEAL OF GROWTH IN THE TELE HEALTH SECTOR. WITH GROWTH COMES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THAT COULD BE HAMPERED IF IT'S FIFTIES REGULATIONS WERE TO BE ADOPTED AND STATUES. SURELY IF THE AUTHORS GOAL AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS ACTIVE IF EXAGGERATE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND FOLLOW THE POINT MAN. IT CERTAINLY CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT WITHOUT TYING THE HANDS OF THE REGULATORS BY I'M NECESSARILY CODIFYING EXISTING TIMELY ACTION STANDARDS. FOR THESE REASONS FAMILY REGRETTABLY REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT YOU LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND SPONSORS OF THE BILLMOVES FORWARD TODAY. ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY- NOW WILL TAKE ON OTHER WE- WHO ARE AND OPPOSITE. NAME OR- TO. ON A THE GALLERY C. ON UP IN THE LET'S TO RUN TWENTY FOUR.

GOOD AFTERNOON AND HOW THEY GOT THEM BALLOTS WITH KAISER PERMANENTE SAY NOT IN OPPOSITION- BUT I KNOW WE'VE EXPRESSED CONCERN TO MANY OF THE ON THE BILL REALLY WOULD LIKE TO APPRECIATE OF THE AUTHOR AND THE BONKERS FOR TAKING TIME AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS BUT- THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. THANKS LINE PLEASE. ONCE AGAIN SURE IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWO TWO ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE MR K. THANK YOU- BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO QUESTION MEMBER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SEVEN SAYS THAT SERGEANTS CAN NOTIFY THE- ABSENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL BE. AFTER YOU CONCLUDE THIS BILL WILL BE MOVING ON TO OPENING THE ROLE- AS WELL AS OUR CONSENT CALENDAR SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE LET THEM KNOW- ARE THERE QUESTIONS AND COULD I COME OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. A CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I HEARD ON THE PLANT'S CORRECTLY I THINK THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN AT THE TOP TWO TWO ONE WOULD INTERFERE WITH A THERAPIST JUDGMENT ABOUT THE TIMING OF FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS BUT I THINK IF I READ THE BILL CORRECTLY ARE EXPLICITLY ALLOWS BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS FOR ANY PATIENTS BUT THEY HAVE TO CERTIFY THAT THE PATIENT'S HEALTH WON'T SUFFER AS A RESULT SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THE- OPPOSITION FOR THE PLANS COULD. INCLUDE JUST EXPLAIN IF THEY KNEW THAT OR WHY THEY THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD INTERFERE OKAY SO WE CAN BRING IN EITHER JED HAMPTON OR STEPHANIE WATKINS ON TO LINE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR CENTER LEYVA. FIND TO CRITICIZE JEFF HAMPTON ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME OKAY YES. GREAT THANK YOU THANK THANKS FOR THE QUESTION BETTER- IN REFERENCE TO OUR ARCHIVE MONEY- WE ARE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL DOES NOT COMPARE TO REQUIRE A PATIENT MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP VISIT WITHIN THE TEN DAY TIME FRAME. WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE BILL DOES ALLOW FOR- THE CLINICIAN TO MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL AND EXTEND THAT TIME FRAME- IF THE- IF THEY IF THEY SEE THAT AS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT- YOU KNOW WE COULD REFERENCE THOUGH ARE AROUND HIM OF THE FEDERATION ABOUT ONE INDIVIDUAL OR WORK HE SHOULD MADE SHOES. I SHOULD NOT HAVE A FOLLOW UP VISIT WITHIN THE TEN DAY TIME FRAME TO GET BACK BE ANYTHING I WANT LINES OF. YOU KNOW NOT DOING THAT THAT INITIAL PROVIDER WHO PERFORMED THE INITIAL DEFINITELY WAS THAT WITH A GOOD FIT THEM- OR THE OFFICE WE SPEAK PERSONAL SCHEDULING. OR OTHER THINGS THAT THAT COME INTO PLAY- THAT THAT WOULD ONLY A WHICH WOULD PREFER THE PATIENT HAVE YOUR SOMETHING LONGER SO WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE BILL DOES PROVIDE. THAT AS THE CLINICIAN TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WILL BE ON THE TEN DAY TIME FRAME- BUT WE ARE. ARE CONCERNED THAT IT DOES NOT. SOMETHING- FOR PATIENT TO. THAT TIME FRAME WHILE. OKAY THANK YOU HAVE THAT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PUBLIC TRAIN. OVER CLOSE SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT MAKES THAT CALL- I'VE YOU TALK ABOUT THE WAR FORCE. BUT I HAVE HEARD OF IT THERAPISTS SAY THEY DON'T CONTRACT IN NETWORK WITH HEALTH PLANS BECAUSE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE TOO LOW A PAYMENT TIMES ARE TOO LONG AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ARE TOO GREAT. IF THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGE IS THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO PROVIDING TIMELY FOLLOW UP CARE CAN YOU TELL US SOME STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN TO BRING MORE LICENSED THERAPIST IN NETWORK SPECIFICALLY CAN YOU GIVE US INFORMATION REGARDING ANY IMPROVEMENTS YOU'VE MADE IN REIMBURSEMENTS. PAYMENT PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROVIDERS. SO IF- MISTER MAGIC HAMPTON OR STUFFY WALKEN'S- WOULD LIKE TO PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION. HOME. I THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE QUESTION CENTER- I WOULD- YOU KNOW TO GET BACK WOULD HAVE TO ADD THAT TO THE BACK- IT DIDN'T GET TOO SPECIFIC FOR YOU RELATED LOVE THAT THE MORE SPECIFIC ELEMENT. QUESTION HAS TO ASK THAT THE BENEFIT TAKEN I KNOW. WE LOOK- QUITE A BIT AROUND- THE- THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION FOR A FUTURE REPORT THAT HAD. THE GAS AND BUT I THINK. IF YOU ARE OKAY I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO- ONCE AGAIN GO BACK. AND TOUCH BASE WITH THEM PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR YOU ON THAT QUESTION MOVING FORWARD. YES THIRTY GREAT I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO HELP WITH THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGE WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH. HAS ALWAYS BEEN CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT IT'S EVEN MORE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOW- I KNEW I WAS ON THE PICKET LINE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WITH ARCHITECT FRASER. AND WITH THEIR THERAPIST BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO- IMPROVE THE WORKING CONDITIONS AND ONE OF THOSE WAS. HER MORE THERAPISTS SO YES ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN GIVE ME. REGARDING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. TO HELP WITH THE SHORTAGE WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS ON. OUR COMMENTS ON SB TWO TWO ONE CENTER GROVE. IT MAKES SENSE OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN I APOLOGIZE GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN COMMITTEES AND- I DID AND I AND I APOLOGIZE IF THIS QUESTION HAS ALREADY BEEN ASKED AND ANSWERED- BUT JUST FOR MY INFORMATION- MY CONCERN THAT I HAVE WITH THE BILL I GET. I AGREE THAT WE NEED. A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SPECIALIST TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH PEOPLE IN A TIMELY MANNER. BUT THE HUGE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THE SHORTAGE OF THE SPECIALIST AVAILABLE. TO MEET WITH INDIVIDUALS- IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR BILL- THAT. DEBT IS A FINE REQUIREMENT- A FINDER'S FEE. IF THERE ISN'T A REFERRAL WITHIN THE TEN DAY TIME FRAME AND THE MAIN REASON I ASK THAT IS I THINK IT'S NOT RIGHT TO PUNITIVELY PUNISHED. HEALTH PLAN. IF THE HAVE A DESIRE TO REFER PEOPLE TO A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT THERE ARE NO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROFESSIONALS AVAILABLE. S. AND WIENER DID YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION. SURE SO I FIGURED A QUESTION. SO IF- IF FOR. HEALTH PLAN. VIOLATES THE LAW. THERE CAN BE ENFORCEMENT ACTION. OF A ONE OF THE RIVERS. AGENCY IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN TO AND- INSURANCE. TO HELP THANK REYES WHATEVER DEFENSE. THAT THEY WON- WE DID HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT- ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH THE MENTAL WORKFORCE- WE ARE IN BETTER PROBLEM- IT GETS OVERSTATED AT TIMES- WE DO NEED TO INCREASE THE WORKFORCE AND I SEE CENTER AND MENNONITE- AT OUR NEWLY RECONSTITUTED MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS. OR FOCUSING ON THAT PARTICULARLY FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES- BUT I THINK SOMETIMES. OUR DOCTOR TO REYES OVERSTATED AS AN ISSUE AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO GIVE GOOD ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT- THE- WE AT THE PLANS CAN DO BETTER- AND YOU KNOW THE AND THE LAW HAS RECOGNIZED THAT. YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT A POINT WITHIN TEN BUSINESS DAYS- UNFORTUNATELY THE REGULATIONS I THINK ARONIE ISLEY INTERPRETED THAT TO ONLY APPLY. TO THE FIRST APPOINTMENT- SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING OUTRAGEOUS HERE WE'RE JUST SAYING. YOU HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE TO CARE FOR SICK CONTRACTED- WE WOULD NEVER AGAIN THIS ALSO GETS INTO MENTAL HEALTH PARITY. WE WILL NEVER TOLERATE THIS WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND YET WE DO WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND I YOU KNOW WE CAN. WE CAN WORK ON BOTH IN TERMS OF BRINGING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE PROFESSION BUT ALSO HAVING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE. HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE TIMELY CARE. THANK YOU APRIL THAT RISK I DO- I DO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY- THE PHYSICAL CARE COMMENT THAT SHE MADE ALONG WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH CAUGHT COMMENT BUT- AND THERE ARE. YOU KNOW MORE DOCTORS OUT THERE PROVIDING PHYSICAL CARE THAN THERE ARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND- I DO YOU REALLY DO HAVE A CONCERN I THINK. ESPECIALLY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S RESPONSE TO COVIDIEN pISOLATED DID THE ISSUES THE COVERT IS. THE RESPONSE TO CODE HAS CREATED I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE MENTAL HEALTH. CARE PROFESSIONALS AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD GET THE GET THE PLAN YOU KNOW THAT THE SERVICES THAT THEY CONTRACTED IN THE PLAN. AND THAT THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO OR THEY PURCHASED FOR THAT PLAN. BUT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW HOLDING AN ORGANIZATION ACCOUNTABLE IF THERE'S IT'S A SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE FOR ME IF THERE'S MORE DEMAND AND NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY. AND HOW DO YOU HOLD SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE OR AN ORGANIZATION ACCOUNTABLE. IF THEY'RE JUST NOT IF THIRD IF THE SUPPLY IS NOT THERE. IT WAS A QUESTION- I KNOW I IT'LL BE A COMMON I THINK FULL- JUST AFTER GREETED DISAGREE ON THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT MATTER MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WELL NO BUT YET ANOTHER 1% GROWTH NO I JUST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING OF THE BILL FORWARD BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE NEED AND- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ESPECIALLY I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A RISE IN THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD ADDRESS THOSE THINGS. BUT I JUST I REALLY DO I APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH IT. I JUST IT I DON'T I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT SO I APOLOGIZE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS SEEN NONE I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS UP EITHER REMOTELY. TAKING ALL RIGHT. SIR WIENER AYE IT'S PRETTY YOU BILLING AND BRING THIS- BILL FORD- I DO WANNA RECOGNIZE- ACTUALLY CENTER LEYVA FOR HER LINE OF QUESTIONING BECAUSE I DO WORKFORCE RESEARCH AND THAT SHE'S- LABOR LEADER AND- SOMETIMES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE OFTENTIMES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE PIPELINE HOW MANY PEOPLE TRAINING AND SO FORTH. BUT I WAS A- HE SAID IT IN THE END IT'S ABOUT ALSO. IF YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO INTO A PARTICULAR FIELD TO BETTER BE A GOOD CAREER AT THE END OF IT. SO IF YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET PAID WELL YOU KNOW I CAN BE TREATED WELL YOU CAN GET OVERWORKED- PEOPLE. HE'S YOU CAN TRY TO SHOW PEOPLE TOWARD TRAINING OUT INTO. EDUCATION PROGRAMS THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE THAT INTERESTED THEY WANT TO KNOW FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD THAT WORKS. SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND THE- PLANS RAISING THE ISSUE ABOUT. MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AND THAT THAT THAT CERTAINLY I THINK THERE'S SOME LEGITIMACY TO THAT AT THE SAME TIME. I THINK THE QUESTION THAT CENTER LEYVA PRODUCT IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE. IN TERMS OF ON THE LABOR MARKET SIDE TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT MORE APPEALING FOR MORE MENTAL HEALTH. PEOPLE TO GO INTO MENTAL HEALTH FIELD AND WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRACTICING. THE DIGGING PAID AS ARE DESERVED OR NOT. BEING YOU KNOW THE OVERHEAD ISN'T. ONEROUS YOUR WORKING CONDITIONS ARE ONES WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS ON TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS INSTEAD OF. DOING ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. THINGS LIKE THAT I'D ALSO POINT OUT THAT- IN MY ROLE OF OVERSIGHT OVER THE MEAT C. ON THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE WE'VE OFTEN HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE NEC THE HOUSING AND FORCE THE TIMELY ACCESS RULES. SO THEY'RE NOT LIKE PICKING UP LIKE- WELL THIS ONE AND THAT ONE HERE'S A FINE. LOOKING AT PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR IN FACT ACTUALLY OF SOMETIMES APPEAL TO THEM THEY NEED TO BE A LITTLE STRICTER ON ENFORCEMENT- BUT THERE IS YOU KNOW THEY THEY- DO RECOGNIZE EVEN WITH THE STANDARDS WE HAVE EVEN ON PHYSICAL HEALTH- TRYING TO MAKE THAT WORK AS WELL BUT I THINK THIS IMPORTANT. MOVE TO PUSHED AND ACCESS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND CHALLENGE THE- THE- COVERAGE YOU KNOW THAT THE- THE FIELD TO TRY TO CREATE CONDITIONS IN WHICH- PEOPLE CAN GET MORE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE AND WITH THAT CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND WIENER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK. YOU CALLERS FOR THE STOCK OR CONVERSATION GEN YOUR I DO JUST WANNA. THROUGH THING IN TERMS OF THE WORK. LIKE I SAID WE WANT TO GET MORE. INTO THE SINK. IMPORTANT BUT I DO HONESTLY THINK THAT THE PLANS SOMETIMES USE OVER STATUS AS AN EXCUSE. THIS IS A ROBUST. WORK FORCE AND I THINK THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE PARENTS THE PAY IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH THAT IT DOES THE SWEET PEOPLE. FROM GOING INTO IT. ON THE OTHER PIECE OF IT AS WE WERE ON A- ASSUME. ARE THE WORLD WE INHABIT THESE DAYS. A FEW WEEKS AGO WITH A LARGE GROUP OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. AND ONE OF THE POINTS THAT THEY ALSO MADE IN TERMS OF WORK FORCE IS THAT. SOME OF THEM ARE SPENDING UP TO A THIRD OF THE TIME ON PAPERWORK- FOR THE HEALTH PLANS- AND SO. TRYING TO. MAYBE INVEST IN A MORE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. FOR MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS SO THAT THEY CAN MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY'RE SPENDING. WITH PATIENCE AND MINIMIZE. YOUR TIME WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL IS THERE A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO AN INVESTMENTS. THAT ARE HEALTH PLANS. AND PROVIDERS CAN MAKE. TO REALLY- IT. INCREASES LIFESAVING- RESOURCE. AND FINALLY IN TERMS OF THE- TEN DAYS AND THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA FOR THE QUESTION. ON NOTHING REQUIRES. A PROVIDER. TO DO TO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT EVERY TEN DAYS OF THE PROVIDER THINKS IT SHOULD BE LONGER. AND THE BILL PROVIDES THAT IF THE- IF THE PATIENT IS. SAYS NO I DON'T WANT TO BE TREATED. WORK OR KEEPS CANCELING- THAT IS NOT ON THE HEALTH PLAN- AND IF THE PLAN SAYING THAT THE LANGUAGE ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH ON THAT AND OF COURSE WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AS CLEAR AS A COMMITTEE.
