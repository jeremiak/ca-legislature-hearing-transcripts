WE NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION

IN THAT AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:10.942
LEVEL OF HESITATION WHEN IT

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:12.143

THEY DO AND HOW THEY USE

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.418
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:22.520

YOU'RE DOING GOOD WORK HERE --

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.211
JUST HAD ONE KIND OF CAUTION AND

00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:55.746
AS YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT AN

00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:58.849
EXPERT IN A I BUT I DID RESEARCH

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:01.152
ON A AYE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL.

00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:02.587
I'VE CODED.

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:03.287
YEAH I SYSTEMS.

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.956
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:07.491
YOUR BILL OUR OUR FINAL BAFFLING

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:09.594
LIKE -- THERE'S THERE'S A PHRASE

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.062
HERE ONE OF THE THE BULLET

00:37:11.128 --> 00:37:12.530
POINTS IS THAT A AYE SYSTEM

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:13.798
SHOULD BE DESIGNED.

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:16.000
AND OPERATED IS TO BE COMPATIBLE

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.602
WITH CULTURAL DIVERSITY.

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:18.636
AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU ON

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.671
THAT BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:21.205
MEAN.

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:22.607
FROM A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT AND

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:23.874
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:25.543
HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT A AYE TO

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:26.944
BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT A AYE ISN'T

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:28.512
WHAT IT IS NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:29.914
LOT OF CONFUSION OUT THERE -- I

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.582
THINK THAT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:32.783
THINK THE A I HAVE SOMETHING

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.251
SIMILAR TO SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:35.453
SAW ON THE JETSONS.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.088
RIGHT AND THE REALITY IS THE A.

00:37:37.154 --> 00:37:39.624
I. AS MUCH MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.860
AND SO I I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S

00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.395
A VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF YOU KNOW

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:45.997
STUDYING THIS ISSUE FURTHER BUT

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.598
I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE OF DOING OF

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:48.599
MAKING STATEMENTS THAT.

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:49.934
THAT ARE GONNA COULD FOR FURTHER

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:51.535
CONFUSE PEOPLE CORRECT YEAH NOW

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:52.436
AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:53.504
DO IS JUST TRY TO HAVE SOME

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:55.973
GUIDING PRINCIPLES THAT -- LIVID

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.475
TO SOCIETAL NORMS.

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:58.809
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THAT IS
