NOW IF IT'S NOT HANDLED CORRECTLY AN ENTIRE YEAR'S WORK COULD GET LOST TWO BILLS AMEND THE SAME CODE SECTION AND THEY GET SIGNED INTO LAW O THE SECOND ONE THEN EFFECTIVELY RACES THE FIRST AND NOBODY WANTS THAT SO WE'VE GOT IT SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT A WAY TO RECONCILE THE LAW. NOW WHEN THE ERA OF TERM LIMITS ARRIVED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES IN THE LEGISLATURE LOST QUITE A BIT OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AMONGST MEMBERS AND STAFF THE CHAPTER OUT PROCESS WAS SIMPLY NOT WELL KNOWN BY SOME OF THE NEWER PEOPLE AND IRWIN DECIDED TO TAKE UP THE MANTLE. AND MADE SURE THAT ANYONE WHO HAD A BILL AT RISK OF THIS UNFORTUNATE PROBLEM TOOK THE NECESSARY STEPS TO RESOLVE IT BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE. AND HE'S KEPT TRACK OF ALL OF US WITH HIS CHAPTER OUT OF MEMPHIS IN THE DECADES SINCE SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS INSTITUTION OWES HIM A TREMENDOUS DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR TAKING ON THIS ARE CAME PROCEDURAL PROCESS AND MAKING SURE IT IS HANDLED WELL I FEAR FOR THE FUTURE WE'RE GONNA NEED A NEWER ONE MAYBE WITH A- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSONALITY. WHO WILL TAKE ON THIS THIS IMPORTANT IN THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF WORK. IRWIN HAS BEEN LARGER THAN LIFE IN HIS PRESENCE IN THE LEGISLATURE HE'S INCREDIBLY SMART HE LOVES THIS INSTITUTION TODAY HIS VERY CORE HE LOVES GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AT ITS VERY CORE. HE'S ALSO GOT A VERY VERY BIG HEART. AND WE WILL OBVIOUSLY MISSIN THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER IRWIN NOVACK AND WE APPRECIATE HIM TODAY ON THE SENATE FLOOR THANK YOU WHEN KNOWING. NICE JOB CENTER AROUND. MEMBERS. SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT IRWIN HERE TODAY. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE. CURRENT AND FORMER IS SIMPLY MEMBERS IN THE CHAMBERS TODAY TO BE A TO CELEBRATE AS WELL AS FORMER SENATORS WE WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO THE CHAMBERS. CENTER SKINNER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU I'M MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS AND OUT WHILE I A WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE THE DETAILS THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA. AND I WOULD SAY WHEN I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AS FAR AS I KNOW YOU'VE NOT. GOTTEN INVOLVED IN MY PERSONAL LIFE IN THE WAY THAT OUR FRIEND FROM SANTA MONICA DESCRIBES SO THANK YOU. BUT I STAND AS THE CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY. AND I WELL THAT WAS REFERENCED I WANT TO JUST REITERATE THAT THERE IS NO ONE. KNOW WHAT. IN THE STATE CAPITAL OR I THINK ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHO KNOWS. CALIFORNIA'S GUN LAWS. IN MORE PRECISE AND SPECIFIC DETAIL. THEN IRWIN. AND WHILE THAT CAN OFTEN TIMES BE A PAIN FOR SOME OF US IT IS ABSOLUTELY A GIFT FOR MOST OF US. HIS KNOWLEDGE AND HIS EXACTING COMMAND OF THE DETAILS HAS ENSURED THAT OUR LAWS ARE BETTER. IT'S INSURED THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AND I WILL RELATE A STORY THAT I KNOW SOME OF THE COLLEAGUES WHO ARE VISITING US FORMER MEMBERS I DON'T THINK ANY CURRENT MEMBER MAY HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE AT THE TIME BUT AFTER THE COLUMBINE SHOOTING IF YOU RECALL THE SHOOTERS IN THEIR CASE BOUGHT THEIR GUNS AT A GUN SHOW. AND THERE WERE SOME LOOPHOLES IN CALIFORNIA'S LAW ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT AROUND OUR LAWS ON GUN SHOWS AND SO THERE WAS A BILL AND FORMER A FORMER SENATORS THEN FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CORBETT AND RIGHT RIGHT WE'RE REALLY GOING AT IT AND IT WAS A HER IT WAS AS I UNDERSTAND IT A. AN IMPRESSIVE CONFLICT AND IRWIN STEPPED IN AND IRWIN. HIS INTERVENTIONS SETTLED IT. THE BILL PASSED AND GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNED INTO LAW AND I'M SURE MANY OF US COULD DESCRIBE SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES SINCE IN VERY MANY OF THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE CARRIED. AND I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS AND I KNOW THE ENTIRE SENATE WANTS TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION IRWIN FOR MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S GUN LAWS ARE ABSOLUTELY. SOME OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY AND HAVE GREATLY REDUCED GONE VIOLENT DEATHS IN OUR STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER SKINNER MEMBERS WE HAVE SEVERAL MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH A TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO THE REPUBLICAN LEADER SENATOR GROVE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WHEN I SERVED ON THE GREEN CARPET. AND I WAS BRAND NEW TO THE LEGISLATURE I'D BEEN HERE ABOUT SIX MONTHS IN THIS. MAN COMES UP TO ME AND WANTS TO TALK TO ME ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND GUN LAWS. AND SAYS HE'S THE EXPERT IN THE BUILDING SO I LISTENED FOR AWHILE. HAD A COUPLE OF MEETINGS WITH THEM. THEN LEFT AND THEN A FEW WEEKS LATER HE CAME AFTER HE CAME TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE DD COMMUNITY. DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY. AND WE TALK TO ME AT A GREAT CONVERSATION WE TALKED ABOUT RESOLUTIONS FOR THE DD COMMUNITY. AND THEN I WAS WALKING OUT OF THE BACKSIDE OF THE BUILDING AND I RAN INTO IRWIN. AND WE STARTED WALKING DOWN THE WALKWAY. ANY ASKED ME ABOUT MY LOVE LIFE HE ASKED ME ABOUT. YES HE GOT MY LOVE LIFE HE ASKED ME ABOUT. MY FAMILY. AND SO THE NEXT MORNING I CAME TO STAFF AND I SAID WHO IS THIS GUY IRWIN. LIKE WHO IS HE- AND SO THEY SAID WELL HE'S THE SAVANT HE WORKS FOR. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HE WORKS FOR THE DEMOCRAT LEGISLATURE HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT CHAPTER IN OUT. HE'S VERY SMART ON GUN BILLS AND HE'S BEEN ABLE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THOSE THINGS. AND IT'S SO I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO OR WHEN WAS BECAUSE I KNOW IDEA. AND THEN IT WAS ABOUT A MONTH LATER WHEN WE WERE WORKING REALLY HARD ON THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AND- HE WORKED REALLY HARD BEHIND THE SCENES AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT. BETTER I'M OUT IN YOU HERE TODAY. AND THIS MAN WORKED REALLY HARD BEHIND THE SCENES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOVERNOR. ASSIGNED OF THE LEGISLATION INTO LAW THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY. SO THAT THEY COULD WORK AND LIVE FULL VIBRANT LIVES. OUTSIDE OF BASIC WAREHOUSING INSTITUTIONS. AND HE WAS EXTREMELY. BENEFICIAL AS A MATTER OF FACT I GAVE HIM AN IDEA. AND HE SAID. THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA MISS GROVE. I'M GONNA TAKE THAT SOMEPLACE AND THE NEXT DAY THE OFFICE PHONE CALL CAME THROUGH. AND EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE OFFICE. IT WOULD KIND OF WENT LIKE THIS ON THE PHONE. AND IS ON THE PHONE FOR YOU. AND BROWN. AND I SAID WELL AND SO I TOOK THE PHONE CALL AND SHE SAYS IRWIN BROUGHT ME THIS INFORMATION AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO. WORK ON THIS AND SO SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL WITH THE GOVERNOR AND WHEN DID THAT. SO I'M ADDING YOU BUT THEY'LL BE NO PUNISHMENT OR ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU'RE LEAVING RIGHT SO. IT'S SO BUT HE REALLY WAS VERY HELPFUL IN THAT AND I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL BECAUSE THAT COMMUNITY HAS MY HEART. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT AND I KNOW THAT AFTER DEALING WITH YOU ALL THESE YEARS. AND NOW ON THE SENATE FLOOR. YOU HAVE THE A VERY HUGE HEART SIR AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. THAT GOD HAS FOR YOU IN YOUR FUTURE SO THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF OUR LEGISLATIVE BODY.

IRWIN AND HIS WIFE JUDITH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TOO AND EVEN THOUGH HE'S RETIRING FROM THIS INSTITUTION HE IS MY MOST PROMINENT CONSTITUENTS. SO HE'S NOT CERTAINLY NOT LEAVING ME. BUT YOU KNOW HE CERTAINLY NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION WE'VE HEARD AND NO INVITATION I THINK IS MANY OF US QUICKLY LEARN. IT'S AS IF IT'S A BIT OF A SHOCK. TO REALIZE THAT IRWIN IS RETIRING BUT I. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT I DON'T IT THAT HE'S NOT TO BE WALKING INTO MY OFFICE AND PROBABLY MANY OF YOURS IT AS THE YEARS GO ON SO. YOU KNOW HE IS A LEGEND HE'S PERHAPS THE MOST WELL KNOWN STAFF IN THE BUILDING HE IS OFFICIALLY I DON'T THE OTHER USES TITLE FOR YOUR ONE THE PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT TO THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE BUT AN AS ANYONE EVER USE THAT TITLE FOR HIM AND THE I'VE THAT DOES ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. THE AND BUT AS WE ALL KNOW AND THE LA TIMES POINTED OUT THIS LABEL CERTAINLY IS INADEQUATE. WE JUST KNOWN AS IRWIN. WE GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THEY KNOW THAT WE TALKED THE LEGUMES GROUP IN LONG ISLAND. THE NORTH SHORE OF LONG ISLAND HIS FATHER ABRAHAM WAS A SUCCESSFUL ACCOUNTANT ADVISER TO NEW YORK MAYOR. DAVID DINKINS. HIS MOTHER ROSALYN WAS A HOUSEWIFE WAS ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. NO IT WENT TO DREW UNIVERSITY IN NEW JERSEY THEN WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AT THE UNIVERSITY SAN DIEGO. AND HE DESCRIBES HIS FAMILY AS PROUD AMERICANIZED USE. AND THAT. HE STARTED IN THE CAPITAL WORKING FOR SOMETHING MEMBERS THE PEACE AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE HE THEN WORKED FOR SOAMES PRO TEM DON PERATA. AND THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE RULES COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY WE'VE HEARD HE'S PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN MANY OF OUR STATES. LEGISLATION CLEANING GUNS PENSIONS AND OF COURSE CHATTERING OUT AS WE HEARD HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS SO IF YOU EVER HAVE A QUESTION. YOU'RE ALMOST ON THE NEED TO ASK HE WILL COME AND TELL YOU. SO CERTAINLY THIS IS AN END OF AN ERA BUT I'M SURE HE'S GOING TO BE VISITING US OFFICE AND IF YOU EVER WONDERED. HOW MUCH IT'S BEEN COSTING IRWIN THE DELAY IS RETIREMENT. THIS CONTACTED MY CHIEF OF STAFF THEIR LOSS HE REMINDS OUR EVERY DAY. SO IRWIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF SERVICE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I AM ACTUALLY QUITE HAPPY THAT I WAS ALREADY MARRIED BEFORE I CAME HERE. BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH ARE YOU GOOD ADVICE AND THE AND YOU GOT TO LESSONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IN THE OFFICE AND. MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG THE FLOORS ARE SIR. THANK YOU UP. MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO ADDRESS TO PEOPLE. THAT ARE NOT THE HONOREE. BUT WHO ARE. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN HIS LIFE AND IN OUR LIVES FIRST IN THE BACK OF THE CHAMBER OF FORMER MEMBER THE ASSEMBLY FOR TEN YEARS A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE FOR TEN YEARS THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF FINANCE STEVE PIECE WHO BROUGHT US THREE IMPORTANT THINGS THE ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. ALONG WITH CENTER BROKE THE ELECTRIC DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. AND WHEN KNOWING. THE MOST IMPACTFUL ELEMENT OF HIS HEAD TENURE HERE HE BROUGHT HIM HERE YEARS AGO COME FROM SAN DIEGO AND HAS BEEN PART OF THE LARGER STEVE PIECE FAMILY AND REMAINS PART OF THE LARGE LARGER STEVE PIECE UP FAMILY. IN ADDITION. I HAD MET SO. THE ON A READER. MANY YEARS AGO MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN USED TO STEAL LAW BOOKS OUT OF MY LAW OFFICE. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY RELEVANT THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT IN THE REAL REASON THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON I STAND IS BECAUSE OF THE PERSON THAT STANDS NEXT TO HIM. JUDITH GHARBI. JUDITH GARVEY. I THINK I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THEY'RE STILL FIANCE OR MARRIED I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY BUT THEY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOREVER JUNE. WHAT. TWENTY NINE YEARS AND JUDITH GARVEY WHEN I SERVED BEFORE AT IN THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER WAS THE PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT AT THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE SHE NOW IS A- DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE ON SHE IS THE MOST BRILLIANT HARD WORKING PERSON I HAVE EVER MET IN THE AREA PUBLIC POP IN THE AREA PUBLIC SAFETY WHAT SHE DID I'M JUST TELLING YOU EVERYBODY KNOWS I DON'T SLEEP VERY MUCH. THE FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING JEWELERS ARE STILL IN THE OFFICE IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE BUILDING OUR OFFICE WAS WHERE THE PARKING LOT IS IN NOW WITH THE SWING SPACES GOING UP. OWNER SELF. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WITH HOW SHE HOW SHE PERFORMED IN OUR ONE IS ALWAYS AROUND OF COURSE BECAUSE WE DON'T A LOT OF GUN ISSUES THOSE DAYS. BUT BUT WHAT SHE DID. AND WHAT SHE CONTINUES TO DO IN THE AREA OF. A PUBLIC SAFETY IS NOTHING LESS AN EXTRAORDINARY WE WOULDN'T JUST IN THOSE DAYS WE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIVE BILLS AND ONE YEAR IN OUR COMMITTEE. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THE PENDULUM SWINGS IN PUBLIC. IN OUR WORLD THAT IN THOSE DAYS EVERYONE KNEW TOUGH ON CRIME BILL. AND SO THE CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO DO THAT WAS NOTHING LESS AN EXTRAORDINARY. AND SHE WEAVED IT IN THE MOST ELOQUENT MANNER. AND WHAT SHE AT THE END OF THE AT THE END OF THE TERM. HE SPENT ALL THE TIME DURING THE BREAK PUTTING TOGETHER A BOOK. WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOTHING LESS THAN BRILLIANT. AS THE KEMAH COPY CITY IT IN MY HOME IN MY- HOME OFFICE. THAT LOOKED AT. HE WAS THE PROBLEM WE WERE TRYING TO STALL. AND HERE'S HOW WITH SALT. INSTEAD OF WHAT HAPPENED SO OFTEN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WHICH WE JUST. HAD THIS STUFF SHE REALLY ELEGANTLY WE'VE GOT. AN WAS SO IMPORTANT PART. OF THIS LEGISLATURE GEN PORTENT PART OF CALIFORNIA. AND OF COURSE. SUCH AN IMPORTANT. ANCHOR TO IRWIN AS MUCH AS ANYBODY CAN ANCHOR OR WHEN SO IS PART OF THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT IRWIN DESERVES RECOGNITION HE DESERVES RECOGNITION. BY BEING ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH A STRONG INTELLIGENT BRILLIANT. UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE WOMAN FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS AND THAT SAYS SOMETHING SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT IRWIN. SENATORS WE'D LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER THERE PORTANTINO. SENATOR DOLLY AND SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT DAFT IT'S AN HONOR TO STAND HERE AND TALK ABOUT WOMEN JUDITH WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN SHOWED UP IN MY OFFICE AND I WENT WHOSE THAT. AND MY STAFF EXPLAIN TO ME THAT THAT WAS HIGH. AND THEY SAID YOU HAVE TO BE NICE TO IRWIN BECAUSE HE KNOWS A MORE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CAPITAL THAN ANYONE ELSE IS HE WANDERS INTO OFFICES ANY WANDERS AROUND. AND EVERYBODY TALKS TO THAT TO HIM AND HE LEARNS MORE AND KNOWS MORE AND YOU SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN. HE'S ACCURATE AND SO WHEN PARKED IN MY OFFICE WE USED TO MAKE POPCORN BACK THEN AND KNOWN BEHOLD WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE I THINK MANNA PRO TEM IRWIN SPENDS ABOUT FOUR HOURS A DAY AT A COMPUTER DESK AT MY OFFICE. AND EVERY TIME INTERVIEW A NEW STAFF I HAVE TO SAY WELL THERE'S THIS GUY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO SHOW UP HERE TOMORROW AND IT'S OUR NGUYEN. AND HE ALWAYS CHALLENGES THE YOUNG STAFF FROM MY OFFICE HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO BE HELPFUL. WHAT EVER THE ISSUE IS OBVIOUSLY ON GUN POLICY. NO ONE KNOWS MORE ABOUT IT THAN OR WHEN BUT HIS EXPERTISE AND HIS INTEREST. GO BEYOND THAT HE'S SCOPING NEWSPAPER ARTICLES OF WHAT OTHER STATES ARE PASSING AND ON WEEKENDS ALL GET AN EMAIL WITH AN ARTICLE TO WHAT HAPPENED IN IDAHO. ON AN ISSUE OR BERMUDA ON AN ISSUE AND HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW NEW LAWS AND NEW WAYS TO HELP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW. HE'LL ASK ME FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES A DAY WHAT HIS JOB IS AND HE ALWAYS HAS M. P. MEMBER PROTECTION. AND SO I HAVE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND WHEN I DON'T HAVE TIME. FOR ONE AND I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM HE HAS BEEN ONE TO FOLLOW ME. INTO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO CLOSE THE STALL AND SAY WHEN YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE WITH ME. AND HE USUALLY WILL RESPECT TO THE BATHROOM DOOR NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE IF IT'S URGENT AND IMPORTANT. HE WILL FOLLOW ME INTO THE BATHROOM NOW JUDITH HE IS THREATENING TO COME BACK AS A RETIRED IN NEW IT INTO AFTER HE RETIRES SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE OFFICIALLY WE'LL SEE THE LAST. OF OUR WIN THIS YEAR BECAUSE HE'S THREATENING TO COME BACK. BUT IF HE DOESN'T COME BACK WERE ALL WITH YOU. BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE HIM AND HE'S GONNA HAVE. J. P. JUDITH PROTECTION FROM HERE ON IN. AND SO I JUST WANT TO ADD MY FRIENDSHIP BUT MY LOVE AND MY RESPECT FOR EVERYTHING THAT ARE ONE IS DONE AND ALL THE GUN BILLS THAT WE'VE AUTHORED WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. AND NOW YOU HAVE CERTAINLY HELPED THE STATE IN TREMENDOUS WAYS AND JUDITH HE'S YOURS NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSONAL. WOULD LIKE TO SAY GOOD MORNING TO SENATOR DOLLY YEARS ROSE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. ONE MOMENT SIR WE SHOULD BE GOOD. THE MEASURE PRESENT MEMBERS ARE AND I JUST WANT TO ADD ON IS AS MOST MEMBERS OF TALKED ABOUT THAT WHEN I CAME. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. YOU CAME BY MY OFFICE AND I WAS LIKE WHO I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHO WHAT WHAT YOU DID I THOUGHT YOU ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE YOU KNEW MORE ABOUT MY RACE. THAN MOST PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT MY RACE AND JUST AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE YEARS YOU COMING INTO MY OFFICE AND TALKING TO ME ABOUT POLITICS AND ABOUT. THE RACES YOUR INSIGHT I HAD MY REAL FIRST CHAPTER IN THE ISSUE WAS COMING THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY OVER THE SENATE AND ACTUALLY. THE CENTER FROM BERKELEY NANCY SKINNER HAD A BILL AND SHE SAID AND HE SAID YOU'RE IT YOU TOLD ME I WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A HEADER. BUT SHE WOULD DROP MY BILL SO WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE CHATTERING OUT SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT MOST YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS THAT. SOMEHOW HE GOT MY CHIEF OF STAFF TO JOIN THEM I THINK IT'S THE MINING UNION IN VIRGINIA. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BUT HE'S CARRYING A CARD AND HE'S IN A UNION NOW. SO ONE IS ALWAYS IN MY OFFICE DOING THINGS AND CATCHING ME ON THE STREET. AND GIVING ME INSIDE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED ON THE POLITICAL SIDE OF OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE SO. I ENJOY YOUR MISS. YOU I'M SURE I'LL BE SEEING YOU SOMEWHERE CATCHING THE. IN BETWEEN HERE IN THE PARKING GARAGE. IS WHERE USUALLY ACOSTA ME LET ME KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SO. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL SURELY MISS YOU. ARE ONE. THANK YOU SENATOR. FLOORS YOUR CENTER MITCHELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT I APPRECIATE THE LEVITY THAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING TODAY BECAUSE I SAT HERE AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE AND MORE I'M FEELING KIND OF SENATE. TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST. AND I'M FEELING SAD BECAUSE AS I SAID WHO DID THE CALCULATIONS I WAS AND I GUESS IN MY HEART AND MIND ALWAYS WILL BE A SENATE STAFFER. AND I WAS A SENATE STAFFER LONGER NOW THAN I HAVE SERVICE HOUSES AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. OUR IRWIN AND I WERE COLLEAGUES BACK WILL NOT SENATOR BERNIE WAS PRO TEM. AND. AS I REALIZE WHAT THIS WEEK HAS BROUGHT US IT IS BROUGHT US BERMAN RETIREMENT IT HAS BROUGHT US A DATSUN WILSON'S RETIREMENT AFTER FORTY YEARS IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. AND I AM CLEAR. I THINK BASED ON MY STAFF MEMBER ROOTS IN HISTORY. THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS STAND AND RELY ON PROTOCOL IN HISTORY AND THOROUGHNESS. AND A THIRTY FOUR YEAR HISTORY BRINGS US OF FOR THE SOLID MEMBERS OF QUITE FRANKLY MEMBERS COME AND GO MEMBERS CAME AND WENT PRE TERM LIMITS IMPOSED TERM LIMITS. AND SO THIS INSTITUTION RELIES. ON HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE. MEMBERS COME IN AND INTRODUCE BILLS AND THINK IT'S THE BEST IDEA SINCE SLICED BREAD AND IT REQUIRE SOMEONE TO TELL YOU ACTUALLY NO THAT'S BEEN TRIED A HALF A DOZEN TIMES AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY YOU WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME EITHER. AND WE RELY ON THAT ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTITUENTS WE SERVE. ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO IRWIN TOLD ME UP LIKE HE SOLD ALL OF YOU ABOUT HOW MUCH IT WAS COSTING HIM TO SERVE US. AND THE PUBLIC. AND I SAID IN MY FLIPPANT WAY IN WHICH WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OUR BANTER BACK AND FORTH. YOU CAN'T LEAVE ANTI FIND SOMEONE TO REPLACE YOU. BECAUSE OF MY CONCERN ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THIS INSTITUTION AND OUR RELIANCE ON PROTOCOL IN HISTORY. AND SO I WOULD GET FREQUENT UPDATES. ABOUT HIS EFFORTS TO FIND REPLACEMENTS ONE OF WHOM WAS IN MY OFFICE WHO RECENTLY LEFT TO TAKE ANOTHER JOB. BUT WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF FOCUS AND COMMITMENT AND LOVE. FOR CALIFORNIA FOR THIS INSTITUTION THAT HE AND QUITE FRANKLY DOTSON HAVE EMBODIED. FOR DECADES. SO I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK I WAS WRONG IN SAYING THAT YOU NEEDED TO FIND SOMEONE TO REPLACE YOU BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN. WHAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE STAFF MEMBERS WHO SERVE THIS INSTITUTION UNDERSTAND. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT MEANS AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOMEONE WHO TRIES TO STEP IN AND FEEL YOUR SHOES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA I FOR ONE APPRECIATE IT. MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR UMBERG IN IN SENATOR HUESO. WELL THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES WHEN ARE YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST MET WE WERE SOPHOMORES IN HIGH SCHOOL TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO.

BUT BUT WE SPOKE AGAIN AND YOU SAID TO TALK TO THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THE PEACE AND HE WOULD FILL ME AND STEVE DID HE TOLD ME YOU NEED TO RUN DONE STUFF BY IRWIN BEFORE YOU. MOVE ON ANY ISSUE RELATED GUNS AND SO I DID SO I DEVELOPED A VERY CLOSE FREQUENT INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH WHEN YOU MAY NOTICE I'M NOT INTRODUCED IN A GUN LEGISLATION SINCE THEN WHEN WERE YOU HELP ME. YOU MENTORED ME HERE AS AS A YOUNG PERSON IS THE YOUNG MEMBER THE LEGISLATURE AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO GET JUDITH GARVEY ALSO WHEN JOHN BURTON CHAIRED PUBLIC SAFETY IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT JOHN BURTON AND BARBARA LEE AND TOM BATES ALSO A PUBLIC SAFETY.

GO BACK PROBABLY FURTHER THAN ANY OF YOU WITH THIS MN TO THE MID EIGHTIES WHEN HE FIRST CAME HERE AND I WAS SERVING AS REPUBLICAN LEADER. AND IT WAS AN ADMIRING HIS INTELLECT. THE WARRIORS INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT CAME FROM. IS A LOSS. INSTITUTIONAL MEMBER. IT IS A GENERATION OF SOCIETAL PHENOMENON AS WELL. IN SOCIETY PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO CARE AS MUCH ABOUT HISTORY. THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT IT'S ABOUT ME ABOUT NOW. WELL IF THAT IS YOUR ATTITUDE YOUR DECISIONS WILL NOT BE AS A REASON. AS LONG LASTING AND IS AFFECTING. URBAN NOTES INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY. OF THE INSTITUTION OF ITS RULES OF THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE IN THOSE PERSONALITIES HAVE HAD A DIFFERENCE. ON THE ISSUE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST WHAT DATE DID THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUT THEIR PERSONALITIES AS WELL. HE KNOWS THAT. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IF YOU ARE AWARE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE AS HE IS. WELL THEN YOU MAKE YOUR DECISIONS TODAY. BASED ON CONTEXT. AND YOUR PREDICTABILITY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR DECISION. ARE GOING TO BE MORE GROUNDED AND FOUND IT. THE POLICY WILL BE BETTER. HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE BACKGROUND. INNOCUOUS WHATEVER PRESENT. INNOCUOUS BECAUSE YOU'RE COMMON SCREAMING DOWN THE HALLWAY NEED JUST ISSUES OUT. THE SMOKE BY. ALWAYS HELPFUL ADVICE. WE MAY DISAGREE ON SOME THINGS BUT IS OUGHT BY THE VICE IS ALWAYS A GREAT VALUE. MY POINT IS THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE MORE RESPECTFUL. AN INTELLECTUALLY CURIOUS OURSELVES. ABOUT WHAT WENT ON BEFORE. HOW THINGS WERE DONE ONCE UPON A TIME. BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS NOT BETTER NOW. AND THIS MAN. IT WOULD BE WHAT I CALL KIND OF THE GLUE. THE HOLES THE INSTITUTION. AND IT'S THE INTEGRITY TOGETHER. NOT DISPOSED TO SEND A MESSAGE BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE HIM. I THINK THIS INSTITUTION IS A VERY PART OF HIS BEING. AND I FIND COMFORT.

THIS IS WHO THIS INDIVIDUAL IS AND IT'S BEEN SORT TAKE PLACE SO INCREDIBLY WITH EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO'S LOOKED AT THEIR MIKE UP. TODAY NOW. A CAPITAL A CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL. HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WITHOUT IN OR WHEN WITHOUT IRWIN IS THE PHANTOM WITHOUT THE OF THE OPERA WITHOUT THE PHANTOM OR THE LAWS OR THE WIZARD OF THE OZ WITHOUT THE WHIZZER. THAT'S HOW MUCH OF THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS MEANT TO ALL OF US AND AS THE FLOYD. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICK FLOYD FAMOUSLY STATED A FEW DECADES AGO THAT THERE WAS A SO CALLED IMAGINARY DMZ FOR ONE LINE AT IRWIN LINE THE BOUNDARY THAT HE WAS NOT TO CROSS. AT ANY TIME HE ENTERED HIS OFFICE NO I DON'T EVEN OVER WHEN YOU'RE RESPECTED A RECOGNIZE THAT EDICT FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICK FLOYD AT THE TIME. BUT I CAN SAY THIS. THAT RUINS LEGACY LIVES. ON EVERY SINGLE CORNER OF THE STATE CAPITOL. IRWIN HAS HAD IN TREMENDOUS IMPACT AND IS IMPACTED THE LIVES OF SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. NOW WE TALK ABOUT CHAPTER RING IN AS THE APPROACH CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AS THE PROBES CHAIR HERE IN THE SENATE AS THE PRO TEM. MADAM PRESIDENT. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT CHAPTER YES OR IN ROLE MINISTERTHIS DAY I DON'T KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING IRWIN JUST CREATED HIMSELF TO CREA I GOT TO CREATE A JOB FOR HIMSELF THE LAST FOR SO MANY DECADES. HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE BUT HE HAS HAD AN INDELIBLE MARK. ON THIS INSTITUTION IN THE LIVES OF SO MANY OF US B	C REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS HIS LEGACY. WILL LIVE ON FOREVER. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO IS A MENSCH. IRWIN AMIGO HEY THIS INDEPENDENT MODEL THAT IS A YOU DISH THAT YOUR GREAT BROTHER MY FRIEND CONGRATULATIONS EACH AND EVERYONE IN. PROGRESS AS A FRIEND. MEMBERS THIS IS BEEN A WONDERFUL MORNING. AND TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE THIS OUT. AMERICANS THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND LET ME JUST START BY SAYING I'M NOT SURE THAT I ACTUALLY DESERVE THE HONOR TO CLOSE THIS OUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME GIVEN ALL OF THE HISTORY OF HER BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT. SO I'M HONORED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AND I WANT TO START ITH AN INCREDIBLE THANK YOU. TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA. FOR THE HONORABLE JOB THAT HE DID AND THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH HE PUT THIS TOGETHER. I WAS BLOWN AAY AND I THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS AS SERIOUS AS YOU DID SO THAT WE WOULD DO THIS RIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT SO I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING. TODAY'S A BIG DAY FOR US AS YOU ALL KNOW. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA'S GOT SOME WORK TO DO AND SO ONE WOULD THINK THAT I WOULD GET A LOT OF PHONE CALLS LAST NIGHT FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND PROCESS BUT NO I GET CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO SAY CAN I COME CAN I BE THERE CAN I SPEAK I INTEND TO SHOW UP FOR IRWIN. AND SO I THINK IT IS REALLYWONDERFUL THAT WE GET TO DO THIS TODAY AND TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO GAVE INCREDIBLE STORIES THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT IS THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT. THAT SOMEONE HAS HAD ON OUR LIVES ON THE LAWS OF THIS INSTITUTION AND FRANKLY ON THE LIVES OF OUR CALIFORNIANS AND I WAS AS AMAZED AS ANY OF YOU TO LEARN THAT THERE WASN'T IRWIN. AND WHAT THAT MEANT IT TOOK ME SIX YEARS IN THE ASSEMBLY. TO LEARN IT BECAUSE- WHEN I BECAME SPEAKER WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING IS I ALWAYS HAD A STAFF MEMBER THAT SEEM TO GET BETWEEN ME. THE IRWIN. I SEEM COMMON I DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS BUT IMMEDIATELY SOMEONE WOULD GET IN BETWEEN ME AS IF THEY WERE SECURITY AND I'M LIKE WHAT IS THIS AND I ALWAYS HEARD THESE INITIALS IMPEDE IMPEDE IMPEDE FROM HIM AND I'M ONE DAY I FINALLY SAID OH SEVEN OR WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT WHO IS HE- AND SO THE IRWIN STORIES HAVE BEEN TOLD AND RETOLD IN THE BUILDING THEY'RE LEGENDS OF OLD. AND FOR ME I WILL SHARE TWO ONE I WAS A SENT A NEW SENATOR AND GOVERNOR KATE BROWN WHO I HAPPEN TO KNOW STOP BY TO SAY HELLO TO ME ON THE FOURTH FLOOR AND WE HAD JUST WRAPPED UP A MEETING AND WE'RE LEAVING THE OFFICE AND I SAW IRWIN DOWN THE. THE PATHWAY TO THE LOBBY OF MY OFFICE. AND HE WAS MID SENTENCE ALREADY ABOUT WHATEVER HE WAS LYING IN WAIT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT. AND I WAS MOMENTARILY PARALYZED. IT'S LIKE SOMEONE SEES A CAR WRECK ABOUT TO HAPPEN AND IS POWERLESS TO STOP IT. AND THEN I HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO LOOK AT MY CHIEF OF STAFF NICK AND SAY. YET I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS. BUT. WHEN HE GOT THERE HERE IS WHAT HE HEARD HE'S TALKING TALKING TALKING WAIT I KNOW WHO YOU ARE GOVERNOR KATE BROWN AND THEN WHEN STARTED I KID YOU NOT TO RATTLE OFF ALL THE GUN BILLS THAT ORGAN HAD PASSED AND PROCEEDED TO TELL HER WHAT PROBLEM SHE HAD WITH EACH OF THE ONES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADJUSTED. NOW YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE. WHAT THE GOVERNOR OF OREGON MUST HAVE THOUGHT. WHY DOES CALIFORNIA HAVE SOMEONE STAFFING AND STOCKING MY LEGISLATION. YOU KNOW IT WAS OUT YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP RIGHT THE OTHER DAY I HEARD A STORY OVER WHEN THAT I HADN'T HEARD BEFORE. I THAT REALLY TOUCHED MY HEART THAT MANY YEARS AGO HE MAY HAVE ACTUALLY SAVE THE LIFE OF ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS. UP WITH MY STAFF MEMBERS TODAY WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD BY NOTICING THAT SHE WAS CHOKING BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DID. AND THAT GOOD DEED ALONE EARNED SOME SERIOUS CAPITAL KARMA. YOU KNOW EVERY SESSION SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE ERNEST TURNED HIS LASER LIKE FOCUS TO OUR SAVING OUR BILLS LATE NIGHT EMAILS AS ALL OF YOU HAVE HAVE SHARED ALREADY BY NOTICING THOSE MASTER BASHER CHAPTER RING OUT PROBLEMS AND I NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE HE STARTS MID SENTENCE. AND I JUST FORWARDED TO NECKING KIMBERLY INSIDE FIGURE THIS OUT TAKE CARE OF IT BUT THEY'RE ALREADY COPIED ON THE EMAIL SO I'M NOT SURE WHY I BOTHER YOU KNOW IT AND AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID IT'S NOT THE MOST GLAMOROUS PART OF GOVERNING BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND NO ONE DOES IT LIKE OR WHEN. AND SO I THINK IT'S ALMOST IMPORT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WITH ALL OF HIS PERSONAL RESOURCES AND I GOTTA SAY OR AND IF I WERE A MEMBER OF THE BC CLASS. I'M NOT SURE YEARS WHERE I'D BE SPENDING MY TIME. BUT PLEASE DON'T ANYBODY QUOTE ME ON THAT BECAUSE I'M UP FOR REELECTION. I LIKE ALL OF YOU OF HONOR TO SERVE HERE.
