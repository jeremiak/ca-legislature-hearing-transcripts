00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.313
TRAINING THAT ENCOURAGING ALL

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.749
EMPLOYEES TO REPORT IF --

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.383
HOW INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IF

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.685
THEY WITNESSES --

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.420
AT THE VERY LEAST TO FIND OUT IF

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:28.020
IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:29.789
REPORTABLE SO THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:30.623
AN ONGOING.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.391
TRAINING --

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.426
GOAL AS WE WORK WITH OUR

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:39.332
EMPLOYEES --

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:40.666
WITHOUT IT THERE'S NO MORE

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:43.569
COMMENTS ABOUT THE CHANGES.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:44.337
I'M I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE PUBLIC

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:46.439
COMMENT AND THEN I'LL COME BACK

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:47.406
BUT LET US ALL GO NOW TO OF

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.542
SENATOR BATES.

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:50.843
BOTH A FEW AYE TERROR THOUGHT

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.811
RIGHT.

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.613
THIS IS NOT INCLUDED IN YOUR

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.081
CURRENT DOCUMENT AS AN AMENDMENT

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.749
IT'S A SUGGESTION THAT WE PUT

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.451
FORWARD WHEN WE REACH JOINT

00:06:58.518 --> 00:06:59.318
RULES.

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.888
IT IT HAS TO DO A SECTION FIVE A

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:03.956
RETAIN HOW SECURITY DETERMINE

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.525
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO REPORTS.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.894
FAR IN THE LAST LINE ON SECTION

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.262
IT SAYS THE CHAIR OF THE

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:10.730
RELEVANT RULES COMMITTEES WHO

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.165

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:12.965

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:14.300
THAT SUGGESTED ONLY TO

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.802
INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO GET THE

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:18.437
REPORT CANDID THAT PUTS A HUGE

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:19.839
BURDEN ON THE DOWN.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:24.043
SIDE PERHAPS BEING A PROBLEM.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.710
I HATE TO USE THE WORD ACCUSED

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:25.411
BUT THE PERCEPTION MIGHT BE THAT

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.380
THEY COULD BURY A REPORT ON

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:28.214
SOMEONE.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.715
FOLLOWING IN THE SORT OF THE

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:32.585
APPROVAL EASIER A AND SO I'M

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.787
SUGGESTING THAT OUT WE ADD WE

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:35.922
STRIKE.

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:37.657
THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THE CHAIR

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:38.925
OF THE RELEVANT RULES COMMITTEE

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.326

ALL FIVE MEMBERS OF THE RULES

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.634
COMMITTEE THAT'S HOW IT OPERATES

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.836
ON THE SENATE SIDE.

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:51.404
IN THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.239
IN INDIAN THE ASSEMBLY EACH

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.208

VICE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY RULES

00:07:58.344 --> 00:07:59.212
COMMITTEE.

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.947
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:02.348
OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.217
PROVIDES A BROADER DISTRIBUTION

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:05.952
AND I CHAIRMAN. FOR FREE

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:08.221
CHAIRWOMAN FRIEDMAN HAD ON THE

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:10.323
QUESTION REGARDING BY WOULD THAT

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:12.425
INCLUDE ALL REPORTS EVEN THOSE

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:13.459
WERE THERE WAS JUST AN

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.094
INAPPROPRIATE COMMENT THAT

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:15.928
DOESN'T LICENSE.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.296
I THINK WE COULD THINK ABOUT

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:18.764
THAT BETWEEN NOW AND THEY ON IN

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.666
AFTER SPUR APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.801
THAT ALL CAN KNOW.

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:24.070
MAYBE FACTOR INTO IT THAT'S FINE

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.938
BUT I THINK IF I WERE THE PRO

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.773
TIM AND I WAS GOING TO BE THE

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.375
ONLY ONE THAT GOT THE REPORTED

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:29.942
IF YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS A

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.677
LITTLE DUST UP ABOUT THAT

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:32.144
EARLIER.

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.813
THAT'S THAT'S NOT A GOOD BURDEN

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.181
TO PUT ON THE INDIVIDUALS ON

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:37.416
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING.

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:38.918
LIKE THIS THE CULTURE CHANGES IF

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.486
THERE'S ANY SORT OF FAVORITISM

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.355
OR LACK OF TRANSPARENCY SO I

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.256
THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:44.957
ADDRESSES BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:45.458
THAT.

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:47.026
WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT ON THE

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:50.963
COMMITTEE ARE ALL OVER THE OVER

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.564
THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:52.198
AND TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.032
AND WE WOULD ALL.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.367
YOU KNOW HAVE A COPY AT THE SAME

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:55.234
TIME COUNT OF THE SAME

AND OPERATE VERY DIFFERENT WILL

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.919
BE IMPORTANT WE MAKE SURE.

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.186
THAT THE LANGUAGE JUST APPLIES

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:15.421
TO BOTH --

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:16.355
RULES COMMITTEES APPROPRIATELY

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:20.026
AND IN THAT WE ARE CONTINUE TO

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.327

I'VE A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT I'M

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:34.206
SKINNER DOWN THE THREE HAVE

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:35.541
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA.

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:36.542

BUT IT'S GOING TO THE THREE

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:45.718
QUESTIONS ARE GONNA GET ONCE WE

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:47.086
STEP OUT OF THE ROOM AND WE GET

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.254
A REPORTER INTERVIEWS THE FIRST

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:49.722
HIS.

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:50.289
BUT THAT THERE'S A CRITICISM

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.424
THAT.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.758
THE POLICY DOESN'T RECOMMEND

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:54.160
CHANGING STATE LAW TO REQUIRE

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:55.494
THAT DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:55.995

BEEN EMPLOYER BEFORE AND WE'RE

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:15.715
EMPLOYER NOW AND I THINK --

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:16.983
WHAT WHAT'S BEEN UNIQUE ABOUT

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:18.851
THIS PROCESS FOR ME I THINK I'VE

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.586
BEEN --

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:23.055
CERTAINLY THE ONE TO CONSTANTLY

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.691
SAY IT IN ALL OF OUR MEETINGS ON

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.927
BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY THAT

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:28.694
WHERE AN EMPLOYER.

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.931
AND WE ARE DEVELOPING A POLICY

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:32.999
TO GOVERN.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:36.135
OF OUR INTERNAL WORKPLACE

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:37.169
BEHAVIOR.

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:38.871
I THINK THAT WE HAVE STEPPED UP

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:40.473
TO THE PLATE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:44.210
TO HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS --

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.845
ON IT IN THESE NOW EIGHT

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:46.846
HEARINGS TO HELP DEVELOP THE

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:48.581
PROCESS.

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:50.816
FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS AN H. OUR

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.184
POLICY.

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.652
AND I KNOW THAT --

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:54.620
IS -- FOR

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:57.223
SOME CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF ON

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.058
THIS AND ADESIRE FOR

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.594
TRANSPARENCY AND I BELIEVE THE

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.595
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROCESS HAS

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:03.896
BEEN TRANSPARENT.

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.765
AND TO THE DEGREE THAT IT IS

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:08.167
APPROPRIATE IN THAT IT IS A EACH

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:11.537
OUR POLICY. FOR A WORKPLACE THE

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.005
POLICY WE DEVELOPED HAS BEEN

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:16.175
TRANSPARENT WILL CONTINUE --

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.910
TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE IT

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:20.079
POWELL PALATABLE TO US THE

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.213
EMPLOYERS.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.915
BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:23.749
EMPLOYERS WE HAVE A

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.352
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.887
PRIVACY OF EMPLOYEES.

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:29.789
AND SO TRANSPARENCY WE TALK THAT

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.590
EARLIER HEARING ABOUT SEMANTICS

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:32.525
AND HOW WE CAN KIND OF THROW

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:33.592
WORDS AROUND IN THIS

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:35.294
EXPECTATIONS TRANSPARENCY.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.696
BUT THIS IS AN INTERNAL.

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:40.766
H. OUR POLICY. FOR THE SECOND

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.301
QUESTION ME JUST ADD TO THAT IF

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.602
I MIGHT -- I

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.137
THINK IT'S ALSO WORTH POINTING

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:47.239
OUT THAT THE MODEL THAT WE FACED

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:48.808

00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:08.861
THIS PANEL TO GO BEYOND THAT.

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:10.329
AND TO DISCLOSE SERIOUS

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.797
ALLEGATIONS SUSTAINED

THAT INDEPENDENT COUNSEL DOES

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.119
NOT IMPACT OUR WAY ON THE

MATT MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE

DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:21.673
BUT BEING ON THE FRONT PAGE OF

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.442
THE NEWSPAPER SAYING THAT YOU'VE

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:25.611

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:27.346
SERIOUS ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:29.615
HARASSMENT --

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.219
OF OUR COLLEAGUES WE KNOW WHERE

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:36.088
THAT HAPPENED AND THAT WE WON'T

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:37.489
HAVE CONTROL OVER LEADERSHIP

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.057
WON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.793
BECAUSE OF OUR POLICY SAYS.

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:41.794
THAT WE WILL RELEASE THAT

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.796
DETERMINATION IF IT'S FOUND TO

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:45.264
BEAT TO HAVE OCCURRED. TO THE

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.765
MEDIA.

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.201
SO ALREADY YOU'VE TAKEN.

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.269
THE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP MAKING

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:52.237
THAT DECISION OUT OF THEIR HANDS

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:53.572
WE'RE GIVING THAT NOW FOR THE

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:55.140
FIRST TIME TO AN INDEPENDENT

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:57.075
PANEL TO DECIDE AND THAT'S A

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:58.710
HUGE CHANGE.

HUGE AND THAT IS WITHOUT.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.116

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:04.683
IT DID YOU KNOW THAT IS --

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.517
I THINK.

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:06.852
OUT OF IT WILL BE CERTAINLY OUT

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:07.920

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:09.087
OF THE LEGISLATORS TO MAKE THAT

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:09.922
DETERMINATION IT WILL BE UP TO

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:12.291
THE PANEL. TO DO THAT BUT BY OUR

00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:13.058

STATED AND WE CANNOT OWE YOU

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.695
KNOW OVER STATE I THINK THE

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.263
GRAVITY OF THAT AND I DON'T

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.698
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE LOST ON

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.034
ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND YOU

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:22.668
KNOW THAT'S DIFFERENT FOR MAYBE

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:22.868
WHAT.

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.536
HAPPENED I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:26.171
HERE.

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:27.439
BUT THAT'S THAT'S NEW IS FAR AS

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:30.008
I CAN SEE.

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:32.110
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRS GOOD JOB

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:32.411
[inaudible]

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:37.082
YES. TO I THAT'S WHY I THINK

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:38.984
IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT THAT.

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:41.887
THAT BY PERSON BODY IS VERY.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.155
INDEPENDENT SO THAT.

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:46.024
SO THAT WE HAVE --

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:47.960
NON PART THAT'S THE KEY TO THIS

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:49.628
WHOLE THING IN MY MIND THE KEY

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:50.829
TO THIS IS THAT WE HAVE FAITH.

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:54.466
AND TRUST IN THAT PANEL.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:55.767
THAT WHATEVER THE OUTCOME IS IS

00:18:55.834 --> 00:18:58.637
A IS JUSTICE AT IT IT'S RIGHT SO

00:18:58.704 --> 00:18:59.805
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT UP FOR AND

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:00.873
I THINK THAT'S THE KEY TO THIS

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:02.307
WHOLE THING IS THAT.

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.042
IF YOU'RE PANEL IS.

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:06.078
STRUCTURED IN A WAY WHERE IT IS

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:08.714
TRULY NOT THERE'S NO WAY THAT

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.215
THIS SCALE CAN BE.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:11.817
DONE CAN BE ON THE SCALE IN ANY

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.185
DIRECTION THAN THAT THAT IT THAT

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:14.853
WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMEWHERE I

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.788
THINK IN A POSITIVE PLACE.

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.924
AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT AYE WE

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.192
YOU KNOW WILL.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.261
LOOK TO CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.296
LANGUAGE AS WE TAKE THAT POLICY

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:26.632
FORWARD ON MONDAY AND SO I THINK

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:28.066
IT'S IT'S TWO THINGS --

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.035
IT'S THE ISSUE OF ON NON

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.103
PARTISANSHIP.

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:32.504
AND I THINK ALL OF US ARE GOING

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.206
TO HAVE TO COLLECTIVELY ADDRESS

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:36.775
THIS ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:37.709
BE PROFESSIONALENOUGH THAT HAVE

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:42.014
THE CAPACITY. TO FOLLOW THE

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.249
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:46.418
OF THE PANEL --

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:49.354
AND AND POLICE ARE SELF SENATOR

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.290
MORE LOCKING LIVING EXAMPLE --

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.659
OF WHEN IT WAS INTERNAL

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:55.561
EMPLOYEES IF YOU WILL WHO SERVED

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:57.462
ON THAT PANEL AND SO I THINK

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:58.797
IT'S TWO THINGS THAT WE LEAVE.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.199
I WOULD HOPE WILL PUSH BACK --

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:02.901
TO THOSE WHO SAY THEY WANT A

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.536
TRULY INDEPENDENT AND I DON'T

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:06.071
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:08.774
IN A WORKPLACE AND SO.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.676
NONPARTISAN I HEAR YOU AND I GET

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.344
IT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:13.045
ADDRESS BOTH OF THOSE.

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.614
CONCERNS.

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:17.916
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY I AGREE AND

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:19.418
I'M ALL THIS JUST TO CLARIFY

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:20.419
BECAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:21.853
THINGS THE PANEL DOES ONE IS TO

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.288
MAKE A DETERMINATION IF THERE'S

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:24.756
BEEN A VIOLATION OF POLICY.

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:27.793
THAT'S WHAT IF THIS IS SERIOUS --

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:30.963
AND UP SUBSTANTIATED A VIOLATION

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.698
OF OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:33.365
THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE RELEASED TO

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.800
THE PUBLIC.

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:35.734
THE RECOMMENDATION IS DIFFERENT

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:36.868
THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:38.236
ANTICIPATING RELEASING THAT TO

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:39.438
THE PUBLIC --

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:40.706
THAT'S WHERE WE DO HAVE TO HAVE

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.574
THE DISCIPLINE TO TO BE ABLE TO

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:44.076
POLICE OURSELVES AND TO MAKE

00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:44.576
THAT DETERMINATION AS AN

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:45.444
EMPLOYER.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.179
SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

00:20:47.245 --> 00:20:48.747
POINT.

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.716
THEN JUST WANT CLARIFICATION IN

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:52.884
THAT IS WITH POINT ONE ARE

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:54.987
DEALING WITH LOBBYISTS DID DODO

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:56.655
WE FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH THAT.

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:57.456
IT'S BECAUSE WE CANNOT

00:20:57.522 --> 00:20:59.758
DISCIPLINE LOBBYIST OTHER THAN.

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.593
WE KNOW DISCLOSING THAT THEY'VE

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.661
BEEN INVESTIGATING.

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.096
UMBER AB ARE YOU COMFORTABLE

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.197
WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TO

00:21:05.263 --> 00:21:07.065
ADDRESS.

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:09.067
BECAUSE I WAS CONFUSED AS

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:10.435
ASSEMBLY WOMAN REYES WAS THAT.

00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:12.371
WE WE HAVE.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:13.905
THAT ONE CATEGORY OF LOBBYISTS

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:16.041
AND OTHER AND WAS A LITTLE

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.010
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND.

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:19.711
SURVEY THANK YOU AND THAT'S A A

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.380
VERY FAIR QUESTION I THINK THAT

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.147
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:23.281
DO TO DETERMINE.

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:24.783
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.584
COMES TO ANY MEMBER OF THE

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:27.386
PUBLIC I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:28.887
AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY IF WE HAVE A

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.156
CO IF WE FIND OUT OF FOR TOLD

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.691
THAT ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES IS

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:33.625
SUBJECT?

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:35.227
TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR OTHER

00:21:35.293 --> 00:21:38.897
TYPES OF OF SERIOUS ABUSE FROM

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:39.498
ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:41.500
PROTECT THEM AND WE CAN'T DO

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:42.601
THAT WITHOUT WANTING SOME KIND

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:43.735
OF INVESTIGATION.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:44.469
SO IT WE WILL HAVE TO

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:47.005
INVESTIGATE THAT SHOULD BE DOING

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:48.273
THAT NOW AND I DO THINK THAT IN

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.775
SOME CASES WE DO DO THAT.

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:51.076
WHEN SOMEONE COMPLAINS OF

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.344
SOMEONE THAT THEY'RE IN CONTACT

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:54.112
CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THROUGH

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:56.381
THEIR WORK IS AS HARASSED

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.649
SEXUALLY HARASSING THEM?

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.951
IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF THE REST

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:01.453
OF OUR POLICY THAT.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.988
OTHER CONDUCT TOWARDS OTHERS

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.090
CLEARLY WE CAN'T EXTEND THAT TO

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.692
A CONSTITUENT COUNTABLE FIELD.

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.060
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KIND OF

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:09.928
FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:11.229
AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE A LITTLE

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:12.364
BIT DIFFERENT FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:13.899
WERE IN THE BUILDING AT EVERY

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:15.467
DAY BECAUSE IT'S THEIR JOB BEING

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:16.668
THERE ARE LOBBYISTS.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.003
ON AND JUST MEMBERS OF THE

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.939
PUBLIC BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF MY

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:21.339
IF ONE OF MY FIELD

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:22.140
REPRESENTATIVES.

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:23.942
FINDS THAT THEY'RE CONSTANTLY IN

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:25.410
A SITUATION THAT THAT THEY THINK

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:26.878
IS DANGEROUS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.547
AND IN IN THAT PERFORMANCE OF

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:29.948
THEIR WORK --

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:30.949
WHEN THEY'REOUT IN THE FIELDS I

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:31.950
WANT THEM TO HAVE A BEEN PLEASED

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.251
TO REPORT THAT AND WE NEED TO

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:34.686
TAKE SOME ACTION TO PROTECT THEM

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:35.320
WHETHER IT'S SAYING THAT WE'RE

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:35.954
NOT GOING?

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:36.955
TO HAVE A PUBLIC EVENT WITH THAT

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:39.057
INDIVIDUAL OR OR WHATEVER IT IS

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:39.958
BUT WE HAVE THAT THAT

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.560
RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:42.527
SOMETHING THAT WILL FIGURE OUT

00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:48.600
AS WE MOVE THIS POLICY FORWARD.

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.635
OKAY AMERICA FOR THE COLLEGE

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.204

BE SORRY THIS IS JUST A QUICK

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:55.240
COMMENT -- I

I JUST I WILL I TO WANT TO THINK

00:22:57.275 --> 00:22:58.844
AGAIN AND THE CHAIR AND THE VICE

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.545
CHAIR BUT I THINK THAT SENATOR

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:02.414
MITCHELL YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:04.750
ON THE HEAD THIS IS AN HR MATTER.

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:07.119
AND WE CAN'T OVER FORGET THAT

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:09.387
COMPANIES HAVE HR DEPARTMENTS

00:23:09.454 --> 00:23:10.756
THAT ARE PAID.

00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:12.424
FOR BY THAT COMPANY BAND THERE

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.025
IS REALLY NO WAY FOR US TO BE

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:15.861
COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT WHO WOULD

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:17.095
THATPERSON BE.

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:19.264
I'M INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED WITH

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:20.165
THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE WE

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:21.867
STARTED OUT A LITTLE ROCKY I

00:23:21.933 --> 00:23:23.201
WASN'T SURE WHERE WE'RE GONNA

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:23.902
END UP.

00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:27.806
BUT THIS IS A BIG SEA CHANGE AND

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:29.274
I THINK THAT WE HAVE COME TO

00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:30.742
SOME REALLY GREAT FOR

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:32.344
CONCLUSIONS WE'VE COME TO A

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.479
POLICY I THINK IS VERY WORKABLE

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:35.347
DOABLE.

00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:37.115

WHO WORKS IN THIS BUILDING SO I

00:23:39.217 --> 00:23:41.319
THINK MOVING FORWARD.

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:42.320
IT WILL PLAY ALSO BE A LITTLE

00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:43.922
ROCKY ONLY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:45.824
BIG SEA CHANGE BUT EVERYONE HAS

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.425

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:50.762
HOPE THAT WE ALL REMEMBER WE'RE

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:51.763
IN THIS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.298
WERE IN THIS TO PROTECT THOSE

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:54.833

PERCEIVED TO HAS BEEN.

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:11.883
IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.185
PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE IT'S BECAUSE
