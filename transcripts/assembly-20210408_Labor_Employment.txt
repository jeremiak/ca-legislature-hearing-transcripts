GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS ACTUALLY HOPPING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED EIGHTY NINETY FIVE AS A JOBKILLER. WE HAVE ALL SUFFERED THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE THAT REQUIRES TIME AWAY FROM WORK IN POOR COMMUNITIES UNDERSTANDING OF THAT AND MANY EMPLOYERS ARE READY TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES. WITH THAT LEAVES MANY EMPLOYERS HAVE VOLUNTARY FREQUENTLY POLICIES AND EVEN IF THERE'S NO FORMAL WRITTEN POLICIES MOST EMPLOYERS WILL GLADLY PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH THE KIND OF CRAZY. THEY'RE ALSO COMBINATIONS AVAILABLE AND UNFAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT PRETTY MENTAL HEALTH RELATED TRAUMA RESULTING IN A DISABILITY OUR CONCERN AT THIS BILL INVITED ESTABLISHES THE ANOTHER INFLEXIBLE THREE TO TEN DAY LEAD MANDATE PATTERSON FORCIBLE PROPRIETOR RIGHT OF ACTION OR POT THAT. BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES ARE DOING THEIR BEST AT THIS MOMENT TO KEEP OPERATIONS RUNNING AND AVOID ADDITIONAL LAYOFFS THE STRUGGLE TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN THE NUMBER OF BELIEVES THAT BUSINESSES HAVE HAD TO PROVIDE HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST YEAR. INCLUDING TWO ROUNDS OF SUPPLEMENTAL COVER NINETEENTH EIGHT SICK LEAVE PAID LEAVE UNDER THE CALLOUS AT REGENCY STANDARD THE EXPANSION OF SECRETIVE SMALL BUSINESSES BUT THE EXPANSION OF FAMILY MEMBERS FOR WHICH AN EMPLOYEE CAN TAKE WEEKS TO PROVIDE CARE. THE FOURTEENTH ARE IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE OTHER LEAVE PROVISIONS AS WELL AS ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT WALL OF WHEN YOU LEAVE MAY NOT SEEM SIGNIFICANT AND ISOLATION THAT THE QUALITY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS HAS BECOME OVERWHELMING ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. NEWLY SUBJECT TO THINK FOR A TWELVE WEEK LEAD MANDATE EVEN UNPAID LEAVE CAN COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR EMPLOYERS TRYING TO FIND REPLACEMENTS FOR EMPLOYEES THAT ARE UNEXPECTEDLY OUT. AB NINETY FIVE NEW MANDATE ELIMINATES ANY DISCRETION TO ASK AN EMPLOYEE TO MODIFY THEIR LEAVE REQUESTS TO ACCOMMODATE OPERATIONS OR TO ACCOMMODATE OTHER EMPLOYEES YOU MIGHT ALSO BE OUT ON A DIFFERENTLY. FURTHER AB NINETY FIVE CREATION OF A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE PROVISION OF THE LABOR CODE OPEN THE BUSINESS WITHOUT THE COSTLY LITIGATION A SINGLE POINT OF CASE CAN COST A SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESS.

FOR EMPLOYER ESPECIALLY SMALL EMPLOYER. BY HELPING REDUCE OVERALL OF TIME THAT. CAN OUT ON. AND MAKING IT EASIER TO TRACK ADMINISTRATIVELY BY PLACING THE SLEEVE UNDER ONE UMBRELLA THAT THE EMPLOYERS FROM EARLIER WITH. THIS AMENDMENT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF PAGA PENALTIES AND WOULD ALLOW SMALL EMPLOYERS. BE ABLE TO USE A SMALL EMPLOYER FAMILIES MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM.

GOOD MORNING MY LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT'S BEEN. THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS A SUMMER GONZALEZ. BUILDING MOVED I'M OF THE BILL- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS I AM CONCERNED ABOUT ONE THING AND THAT IS THAT WE ARE NOW CREATING AN CODE OVER AND OVER AGAIN A DIFFERENCE OF RIGHTS WHETHER YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE WORKING FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS TWENTY FOUR EMPLOYEES OR TWENTY SIX RIGHT THAT THE EXTREME DIFFERENCES YOU YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT MINIMUM WAGE- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR WORD. LEAVE POLICIES AND WORK WORK WORK CONTINUING DOWN THAT PATH AND I JUST. THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE THAT WE COME UP WITH A REASONABLE NUMBER THAT- IT'S- IT'S A NEED FOR THE EMPLOYEE ABSOLUTELY BUT YOU HAVE THAT NEED. TO TRULY BRAVE WHETHER. YOU WORK FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OR LARGE BUSINESS SO IF THERE'S A WAY TO- PROVIDE CARE IT SIR IT'S SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE OUR HELP THE SMALL BUSINESSES COMPLY. WITH WHAT I THINK IS A VERY REASONABLE STANDARD AYE I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THAT APPROACH IT'S JUST- I I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THIS- THE DIFFERENCE IT IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE TREATING WORKERS DEPENDING ON. THE SIZE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES SO THAT'S ALL I WILL OF COURSE BUT FOR TODAY. THANK YOU IS THERE IS THERE A SECOND. OKAY BUT A SERVER SETUP THANK YOU. SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU I AM REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THESE AS A PERSON AT WORK IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AS A MEMBER OF THE UNION. DUES PAYING UNION MEMBER- TEN DAYS. WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN TEN DAYS. FOR ME WHY TEN DAYS WHY NOT TWO WEEKS OR THREE WEEKS. IF THAT IS THAT YOUR PREFERENCE IS IT NO I'M JUST CURIOUS. I'M CURIOUS WHAT WHAT THE TEN DAYS WAS ABOUT HER WELL. AS A MEDICAL THING THAT SAYS IN TEN DAYS YOU'RE OVER IT BECAUSE AS WE HEARD FROM ONE OF THE WITNESSES. SHE'S NOT OVER IT I KNOW WHEN MY DAD LOST MY MOM AND I WAS TEN HE WAS A TEACHER- HE NEVER GOT OVER THAT- YOU KNOW HE HE HAD TO TAKE HE TOOK THE NEXT WEEK OFF. BUT IT YEAH I I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS WHY WHY TEN DAYS YEAH BUT IT GETS TO THAT OF A SPECIFICALLY THAT OF AMOUNT OF TWO WEEKS- AND AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE THEM AS A REST CHAIR OF THE BUSINESS A PROFESSION COMMITTEE WHICH WE'VE OVERSEEING DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND AS YOU KNOW DURING THE CALL WE'VE HAD BEEN EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT FUNERAL HOMES WERE OVERLOADED AND DID NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY SELDOM EVEN WHEN SOMEONE PASSES WE DON'T JUST HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY DROP EVERYTHING MANY LIFE CHALLENGES AS YOU ALL KNOW AS I'M SURE SO IT'S JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PROVIDE. SOME TYPE OF ACCOMMODATION FOR THE INDIVIDUALS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFERENT LIFE CHANGES AS YOU ALSO KNOW AS YOU'VE EVER READ THE BILL THERE'S ALSO A SMALL BUSINESS- OF LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT ON THE TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES AT ITS THREE DAYS AGAIN THIS IS UNPAID RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THE UNPAID PART BUT THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS THE LAWSUIT THAT FOLLOWS IF THEY AREN'T GRANTED THAT UNPAID LEAVE THE OTHER QUESTION I SAW PEOPLE SNICKERING. ABOUT IT BUT THE CFRA. WHY CAN IT BE FOLDER INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT DOES COVER A LOT I'VE HAD EMPLOYEES CALL UP AND- THEN ASK. HEY THIS IS HAPPENING SOMEBODY DIED. AND WE JUST WOULD TACK ON WHATEVER IT IS HEY USE THIS USE THIS AND USE THIS YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. FIRED BY DOING OUT ALLOW THE EMPLOYERS. TO DO THAT- BECAUSE THEY ARE- THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT YEAH. A COUPLE OF DISTINCTIONS HAVE AFFECTED DEBT THROUGH THE CHAIR. IT MIND- TO QUALIFY UNDER THE SPECIFIC AKKA WORKER MUST BE EMPLOYED FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. SO IN IN IT IF OF WANTED EMPLOYEES ALL TWELVE WEEKS AS WELL. OF THE RELIEF THEY ARE OUT OF LUCK SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A PARENT IS ALL OF THEIR BENEFITS FOR MATERNITY OR PATERNITY LEAVE. THEN THEY HAVE NO RECOURSE IN CASE THAT MIGHT BE A DEATH OF A CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER SO AGAIN I THINK THOSE ARE TWO DISTINCTIONS AS TO WHY THAT. THE NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR OF SICK LEAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. VACATION TIME AVAILABLE TO THEM. THEY HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT LEAVES AND- HELLO IN IN IN SOME BUSINESSES. WHEN YOU TAKE LEAVE AND YOU HAVE TO EITHER HIRE SOMEBODY AND PAY THEM TIME AND A HALF TO COMMAND WHICH COSTS BY THE WAY PUBLIC AND THAT THE CLASS WHEN WE SAY PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARCHITECT THAT TAXPAYERS THE COST THEM MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO COVER THAT I THINK L. A. COUNTY ALONE WAS UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- SO THERE IS A THERE IS A COST TO THAT NOT COST. FOR PRIVATE BUSINESSES. IS ABSORBED EITHER BY CUSTOMERS OR OR BY THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SO- YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE ARE BIG CONCERNS FOR ME. ANY OF THESE I THINK IT SHOULD BE I THINK YOU SHOULD WORK TO FOLD IT INTO CFRA- I CAN'T SEE ADDING ANOTHER LAYER. OF LEAD TIME- ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THERE'S A REASON MY WIFE'S BUSINESS NEVER EXPANDED BEYOND HER YEAH SHE COULD PROBABLY BE EMPLOYING TEN TO FIFTEEN PEOPLE NOW IF YOU WANTED AND HAD GROWN HER TAX BUSINESS. BUT SHE WON'T NEED THESE TYPE OF THINGS ARE THE REASON WHY. SO THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME SPORTING THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THE ISSUE AND THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS AND I APPRECIATED. THANK YOU I'M NOT SURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HER. I THINK MY ISSUES ARE. SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LIKE I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE BEREAVEMENT LEAVE PART OF THIS AND- I THINK IT IS- VOTER SOME FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND I DO UNDERSTAND IS ONLY WOMAN'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE OTHER THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW IT WHAT TRIGGERS THAT WHETHER YOU GET TEN DAYS OR THREE DAYS- BECAUSE IF YOU. HAVE YOU KNOW. ELEVEN EMPLOYEES OR TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES ARE STILL IN THE SAME- SIZE OF EMPLOYER. MY ISSUE IS WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION PART OF THIS- FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN. THIS BUSINESS COMMUNITY M. IN MY OPINION JUST MY HUMBLE OPINION. COME UNDER ATTACK- FROM. QUITE FRANKLY PREDATORY LAWSUITS I'M IN A LOT OF WAYS NOT SO MAYBE DESERVED SOME OF THEM- I THINK OR NOT. SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT LIKE WE MAIN STREET- COMING THROUGH COVERT IN THE DEVASTATIONS HAPPEN TO MAIN STREET. SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES THE MOM AND POPS THE BAKERY THEY MAY NOT KNOW OF ALL THESE NEW LAWS. THAT ARE DROPPED ON OUR YOU KNOW. I JUST DROPPED OUR LAP EVERY SINGLE YEAR. BUT THE ATTORNEYS DO. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. IT'S THEIR JOB TO DO THIS RIGHT. IT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LIVING AND SO WHEN WE HAVE THESE LAWSUITS THEIR OPTION IS TO FIGHT IT AND PAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND OR SETTLE FOR SMALLER. AND I AND I DO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT AND SO. I'M NOT REALLY ASKING IS MORE OF A STATEMENT- AND JUST KIND OF ALWAYS MY CONCERNS- IT'S NOT THE BREED APART OF THIS QUITE FRANKLY IT IS THAT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND WHAT WE ARE CONTINUING THAT THAT. THAT WEIGHT THAT WE PUT ON THAT AND RELEASED THE SMALL BUSINESS MAIN STREET COMMUNITY THAT I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT MAY GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS. SIMPLY NOT KNOWING SO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF THE GULF YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AND I APPRECIATE- SOME ALONE REALLY BRING THIS FORWARD AGAIN I THINK THAT. SINCE YOU LAST BROUGHT IT IS EVEN MORE. RELEVANT I THINK HIS VISCERAL WELL HE'S SEEN. OVER THE PAST YEAR AND LOOKING AT SOME. OF THE ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION- LISTING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEADER AVAILABLE MEAN BOATING LEAVE FOR TWO HOURS YOU KNOW BUT- THE WHAT I JUST FIND IT. MENTIONED THE OREGON AND- DONNER LEAVE FOR THIRTY DAYS BECAUSE SOMEONE'S DONATING AN ORGAN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE JUST DON'T JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS IS ON PAID LEAVE AS YOU'VE STATED SEVERAL TIMES APPROPRIATELY SO- AND I THINK THAT YEAH I DON'T KNOW MAYBE WE'RE JUST LIVING IN DIFFERENT WORLDS AND YOU HAVE MANY PEOPLE DIED THIS PAST YEAR. I APPRECIATE EVEN THOSE IN OPPOSITION ON THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR MORE FREQUENTLY BUT I THINK BOTH YOU EXPRESSED- OF THE GENERAL SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT AT LEAST HAVING. THE ABILITY TO HAVE BEREAVEMENT AND I THINK THAT IF THIS LAST YEAR HASN'T AT LEAST TAUGHT US THAT MUCH TO ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO TAKE TO TAKE CARE WHEN THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF ONE. ANOTHER PASSED AWAY AND I THINK THAT- AGAIN WE'RE JUST SEEING VERY DIFFERENT THINGS- DURING THE COURSE OF THIS PANDEMIC AND SELF I APPRECIATE YOU A SIMILAR BRING THIS FORWARD WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SUMMER GONZALEZ. SECONDED BY SUMMER RADIUS AND SO MADAM SECRETARY CAN OVERTAKE. THE ROLL CALL VOTE. MOTION IS DEEP TO A- KALRA. I KALRA I FLORIDA. FLORA NOW GONZALEZ. AND SALAS I JONES SAWYER.

I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO THIS BILL THAT- SIX TO CREATE A ROAD MAP WITH STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT THROUGH A PUBLIC DIALOGUE ON ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT TO- WE HAVE BEEN FACING AND THIS LEGISLATURE. WHICH IS HOW DO WE GET TO. THE AMBITIOUS GOALS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ESTABLISHED. IN TERMS OF- CONTINUING OUR STATE'S LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD OUR GOALS OF REACHING A 100% CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER LAST YEAR TO PHASE OUT. THE ESTATE SALES OF ALL. FOSSIL FUEL POWERED CARS AND TRUCKS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT TO A LOT OF TIMES IT'S EASIER TO SET GOALS AS HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE. AND SO THAT IS WHAT I'M PROPOSING WITH THIS BILL- IT IS A AUTHOR SPONSORED BILL I'VE HAD. MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH- YOU KNOW VERY INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS BUT GIVEN YOU KNOW. THE POLITICALLY CHARGED NATURE OF MANY OF THESE ISSUES OF THE ORGANIZATION'S UNFORTUNATELY HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO STEP FORWARD TO YOU KNOW EITHER SERVICE AS SPONSORS ALL OR AS A- YOU KNOW EVEN A PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED AS A SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE.THIS IS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE- SEVEN YEARS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WHERE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO MAKE REFINERY SAFER- WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO PROTECT OUR COAST BY- BANNING OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. OUR WEATHER IS TRYING TO PROTECT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WITH THE OIL DRILLING SETBACKS. AND THAT YOU KNOW CONSISTENTLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT I FACE AND THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE FACED IN THIS LEGISLATURE IS HOW WE CAN. FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING AND GROWING. GOOD TO MIDDLE CLASS UNION JOBS- THE WORKERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. SO WE NEED A ROAD MAP WITH STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED LABOR ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. THROUGH A PUBLIC DIALOGUE SO THAT WE CAN.

MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES GREAT TO SEE EVERYBODY I WANT TO THANK GOD COMMITTEE STAFFER CONSIDERATION AND ENGAGEMENT ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR AGRICULTURE IN POINT FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS THANK YOU KNOWN AS WE KNOW WILDFIRES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF LIFE HERE IN. OUR STATE YOU KNOW BUT- WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR WILDFIRE STATISTICS FROM LAST YEAR AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS- THEY'VE THERE IT'S STAGGERING YOU KNOW ACCOUNTING FOR FIVE OF THE SIX LARGEST WILDFIRES IN THE RECORD HISTORY OF OUR STATE- WILDFIRE SEASON LAST YEAR- IT THERE. THERE IS A DISCONTINUANCE OF UP YOU KNOW A TREND THAT ARE WILDFIRES IN GOVERNMENT BECOME MORE INTENSE BECOME MORE DESTRUCTIVE AND MORE DEADLY YOU KNOW A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED LAST MONTH FOUND THAT TINY PARTICLES RELEASED IN WILDFIRE SMOKE. UP TO TEN TIMES MORE HARMFUL TO HUMANS- THEN- SO PARTICLES RELEASED FROM OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS CAR EXHAUST FACTORIES AND SOME POWER PLANTS. ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE STUDY'S AUTHORS THE HEALTH IMPACTS TO THE WILDFIRE SMOKE ARE ON THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. OR POSSIBLY EVEN GREATER THAN THE DIRECT PHYSICAL COST OF WILDFIRE. AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO MEMBER THE WILDFIRES FROM LAST YEAR WE HAD ORANGE SKIES. AIR WAS FILLED WITH CHOKING SMOKE. AND THE RECOMMENDATION WAS FOR US TO SHELTER INDOORS AND SO MOST OF US HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE AN AIR CONDITIONED ROOMS IN WITH AIR PURIFIERS. FARMING AGRICULTURE WORKERS. THEY WERE MADE OUTDOORS IN SMOKY TOXIC- SOME CONDITIONS AND FILLED IN ORCHARDS. TO PICK CROPS THAT HELP FEED CALIFORNIANS AND OUR COUNTRY. IN OUT. UNFORTUNATELY HERE CALIFORNIA AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A FIRST IN THE NATION EMERGENCY STANDARD. THAT REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE. MANY PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS TO GET THE WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS THEY NEEDED- AND SO. THEIR FIRST OBVIOUSLY THE COMBINATION OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND PRESS THE NUMBER OF WILDFIRES PUT ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ASA PP- AND SO WHAT THIS LEGISLATION PROPOSES TO DO IS THE BUILT ON COUCHES STANDARD.

THANK YOU AND WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO YES SERVICE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION. AS I UNDERSTAND THE EMPLOYERS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES SO THAT THE N. NINETY FIVE MASKS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM. IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM THEMSELVES. IS THAT CORRECT. BUT MY MAIN QUESTION IS. IF THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO IF THEY DON'T PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT THEY HAVE WORKING FOR THEM. THEN THE- BUT- AT THE STATE CANNOT HAVE THE MASKS OF STOCKPILE READY FOR THEM. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THOSE WORKERS WHOSE EMPLOYER DID NOT PROPERLY GIVE THE NUMBER- OF EMPLOYEES. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THEY GET MASKS. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN AGRICULTURE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY- YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO LABOR NUMBERS THEY FLUCTUATE BECAUSE A LOT OF WORK IS SEASONAL- AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK. YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO SPECIFIED IN THIS LEGISLATION- A WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE AN ONGOING- ASSESSMENT OF THE ACCOUNTING OF EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY WILL DO. THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS- I REALLY APPRECIATE SEEING BRING THIS FORWARD AND IS MANAGED BY SOME OF THE- CALLERS YOUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT.

WE'RE NOT SURE THAT ALL OF THE PROXIMALLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS WHO COME TO CALIFORNIA TO WORK AND RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION AT THE POINT OF RECRUITMENT PROTECTION FROM WORD DOCUMENT DECEITFUL PRACTICES OF THIRD PARTY LABOR RECRUITERS WHO EXPORT CONFORMABLE MIGRANT WORKERS SEEKING. TO LAWFULLY ENTERED THE UNITED STATES NOT TO MENTION THE IMPACTS EXPERTS BY LAW ABIDING PORTERS WHO CANNOT COMPLETE WITH THESE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES. DECEMBER BUT WERE CORRECTED DRAFTING ERROR MADE AN S. B. C. FOUR SEVEN SEVEN STEINBERG IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT CREATED THE FIRST FRAMEWORK FOR COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTIONS FOR TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS. AMONG ALL THE TYPES OF VISAS THE H. TWO A. PROPRIOCEPTIVE UP. IS THE TEMPORARY VISA COVERED LINKED TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES IN THE UNITED STATES. EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY REPORT DEMONSTRATE THAT FARMWORKERS THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS WHO ARE CENTER FOR KEEPING AMERICA'S. AMERICANS FED DURING THE PANDEMIC ARE NOT BEING PROTECTED EFFECTIVELY. AB THREE SIXTY FOUR WOULD ENSURE THAT THEY MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH MANDATES THAT ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM EXISTING LAWS REGULATING FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS. AND ONLY APPLY TO THEM IF THEY RECRUIT WORKERS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IMPORTS TO CONTRACT FOR THEIR OWN H. TWO A. WORKERS WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THESE REQUIREMENTS. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY ON THE LINE STEPHANIE RICHARD REPRESENTING THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY. AND TRAFFICKING ALSO CALLING IN IS THE VICTIM OF THE LABOR PRACTICES ON THIS BILL WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MY AND SO WE HAVE TO WITNESSES. OF THE TWO MINUTES EACH AND THE FIRST ONE IS STEPPING RICHARD AND AFTER THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM. ANGELA GONZALEZ SO STEPHANIE IF YOU'RE READY- FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS STEPHANIE RICHARD NINE TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING CAST. CAST OF THE SPONSOR OF AB T. SIX WHO ARE CATHOLIC THE LARGEST LEGAL AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER FOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS IN THE UNITED STATES. BASED ON CASTE AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS EXPERIENCE WITH WORKING WITH TRAFFICKING VICTIMS WE LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO PREVENT TRAFFICKING. BEFORE IT STARTS IS TO LIMIT THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICES OF THIRD PARTY FOR MAJOR CONTRACTORS AT THE TIME OF WORKER RECRUITMENT. THE SHADOW AGENTS FORCE WORKERS INTO DOUBT BY CHARGING THEM EXORBITANT FEES FOR LEGAL WORK VISAS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN EC BEFORE SEVEN SEVEN WAS PASSED WITHOUT ANY THIS PROBLEM. AB THREE SIX FOUR IF NECESSARY FOR THE SAME REASON BUT SB PORT ON SOMEONE WITH AN ACTIVE. DOCUMENT ANGRY THAN WIDESPREAD ABUSE OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING TRAFFICKING OF THE DIFFICULT CRIME TO PREVENT BUT TODAY WE CAN PROTECT THESE VULNERABLE WORKERS. MANY OF WHOM ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BY THE EPIDEMIC AND CONTINUING NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN REQUIREMENTS AS CLARIFIED BY EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PROTECTING ALL TEMPORARY WORKERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. MUCH OF THE DEBATE AROUND EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR FOCUSES ON H. U. AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND WORKERS BUT WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF ALL THE VISA CATEGORIES THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT ABUSES SUFFERED BY WORKERS RECRUITED BY FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS ARE THE SAME REGARDLESS OF THE CATEGORY. FOR THAT REASON THE PERFECT PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR GO WAY BEYOND THOSE EXISTING IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA FEDERAL LAW THEY PROVIDE A SIMILARLY NEED A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK COVERING ALL THESE THE CATEGORY ONE THAT MESHES WELL BUT DOES NOT OVERLAP WITH EXISTING PRODUCTION. THE BILL PROVISIONS ARE ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS EMPLOYERS WILL NOW HAVE A BADLY. BUDGET RECRUITERS IF THEY CHOOSE TO NOT DIRECTLY RECRUIT THEIR OWN TEMPORARY WORKERS. THE UNFAIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESSES USING A RECRUITER. TO UNDERPAID WORKERS WITH EMPLOYER MADE FOR THESE READ CAP STRONGLY URGES I'VE- AYE AT SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND ARE YOU THERE.

GOOD MORNING MISTER MEMBERS OF THE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES HI GOOD MORNING I'M NOT GOING WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO EIGHTY THREE SIXTY FOUR. THE BILL UNNECESSARILY EXPANDS THE PROVISION THE UNDER CALIFORNIA'S FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTING REGULATIONS NOW INCLUDE ASK WORKERS UNDER THE H. TWO A. VISA PROGRAM. HM THIS PROGRAM IS NOT ACTUALLY OVERLOOKED DURING THE DISCUSSION AND NEGOTIATION OF THAT BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH CREATED THE FORM THEY WERE CONTRACTING PROGRAM. H. TWO A. VISAS WERE SIMPLY NOT INTENDED TO BE COVERED BY THE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF NECESSITY TO DO SO BECAUSE THE H. TWO A. VISA PROGRAM IS ALREADY REGULATED BY RESTRICTIVE APPLICATION AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A PRE EXISTING SPECIFIC FARM LABOR CONTRACTOR BY THINKING PROGRAMS THAT IS MANAGED BY CALIFORNIA LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. BY THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS EMPLOYERS MUST AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS DEMONSTRATE THE NEED TO HIRE AN EXTREMELY SUPPORTER. HEY THE HIGHEST THAT THE ADVERSE EFFECT WAGE RATE- THE PURPORTED PREVAILING WAIT TO TURN BY PREVAILING WAGE SURVEY HI FOR THE APPLICABLES STATUTORY MINIMUM WAGE ARE THEY ALSO PROVIDE. HOUSING AT NO COST TO THE WORKER- ADMIN CAL ALREADY HAS A EXISTING. FARM CONTRACT LICENSE PROGRAM THAT IS NOW A FOR BUT IT'S- WHERE COMMISSIONER OFFICE AND ALREADY COVERS FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS. AND IN FACT THIS PROGRAM SERVES AS A MODEL FOR THE CREATION OF THIS BEFORE STEP SEVEN. IT WAS SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY ANALYSIS THAT SB FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN QUOTE CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES LICENSING UP VOMIT BURKE CONTRACTORS ONLY. THIS HAS CURTAILED HUMAN TRAFFICKING RELATED ABUSES UNQUOTE. AS A RESULT EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA FOR LABOR CONTRACT MAKE A PATIENT TO COVER ASK WORKERS UNDER THE H. TWO A. PROGRAM. SIMPLY MAKES LITTLE SENSE- AND IS TO PUT THAT UP TO EXISTING LAW THIS PROJECT IS REASONS THAT WESTERN GROWERS AS OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. BRYAN LITTLE.

TWO A. TEMPORARY AGRICULTURAL WORKER VISA PROGRAM AND FURNITURE CULTURAL BOYCOTT MANY CALIFORNIA FARMS THE FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS HAVE FOR DECADES BEEN REQUIRED TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN A STATE FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS LICENSE. DOING THIS REQUIRES FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WITH A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES INCLUDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING FOR THEIR PERSONNEL POSTING OF WAGE BOND FOR CONTRACTORS SEEKING AN INITIAL LICENSE AN EXTENSIVE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS WITH CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR FLCS TO SEEK RENEWAL OF THEIR LICENCES. AB THREE SIXTY FOUR SEEK TO CHANGE EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH CREATED A FOR LABOR CONTRACT REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS TO RECRUIT AND APPOINT PEOPLE TO VARIOUS FOREIGN WORKER VISA PROGRAMS WITH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THIS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN DOING SO THE AUTHOR SPONSORS OF THIS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN MADE A WISE DECISION TO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE EMPLOYERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE COVERED BY IS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN REQUIREMENTS BUT YOU WERE COVERED BY THE LICENSE REQUIREMENTS APPLYING TO FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS. WITH THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED AS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVENTY SOME JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY CITED THE EXISTING FOR A LABOR CONTRACT PROGRAM AS A REFORM THAT HAD SERVED TO CURTAIL LABOR TRAFFICKING THE PROPONENTS OF SB THREE SIXTY FOUR CLAIMS THAT IT SEEKS TO CORRECT A LOOPHOLE WILL PULL THE LAW CREATED BY US BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN I WAS SERVING MY PRESENT POSITION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I ENGAGE THE AUTHORS ALSO THAT TIME TO CONFIRM THIS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN DID NOT COVER FROM LABOR CONTRACTORS.

AB TEN FORTY ONE UPDATES THE DEFINITION OF A FAMILY MEMBER FOR THE PURPOSES OF FAMILY AND SICK LEAVE ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO TAKE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO ISN'T RELATED BY BLOOD BUT ASSOCIATED AS A MEMBER OF THEIR CHOSEN FAMILY. THIS INCLUDES A FRIEND'S NEIGHBOR MEMBER OF THE LGBTQ I COMMUNITY- OR AT WHO CAN PROVE THEIR DEPENDENCY WITH A DOCTOR'S NOTE. TODAY THE MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS APART FROM THE NUCLEAR FAMILY MODEL OF A MARRIED COPLE WITH HER BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN INSTEAD THOSE FAMILIES. INCLUDE CLOSE LOVED ONES WHO AREN'T BIOLOGICALLY OR LEGALLY RELATED DATA FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS BUREAU SHOWS THAT EIGHTEEN POINT 4% OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS FOLLOWED THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY STRUCTURE. CALIFORNIA FAMILY LEAVE LAWS CONTINUED TO REFLECT AN OUTDATED TRADITIONAL FAMILY MODEL ONLY ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO TAKE OFF TIME TO CARE FOR NARROWLY DEFINED FAMILY MEMBERS. THIS POLICY GAP DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS THE L. G. B. T. Q. I COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA IS THE FOURTH LARGEST L. B. T. Q. I POPULATION IN THE U. S. MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY DO NOT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES. THEREFORE THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE BIOLOGICAL SUPPORT AND RELY ON THEIR CHOSEN FAMILY INSTEAD. ANOTHER STUDY FOUND THAT THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES CAN BE FOUND IN NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES TO THE MOST HOUSING. TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKETS IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR RELATIVES TO BE LIVING WITH COUSINS UNCLES AND OTHER RELATIVES NOT COVERED BY EXISTING LEAVE LAWS SPECIFICALLY DURING THE CLIFF COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PRECEDENT FOR UPDATING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND STATE LOCAL LAW ORGAN CONNECTICUT NEW JERSEY. COLORADO AND EIGHT LOCALITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES HAVE PASSED SIMILAR SICK LAWS THAT COVER CHOSEN FAMILY. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THESE OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE THERE. FOR THEIR LOVED ONES REGARDLESS OF THEIR BLOOD OR LEGAL RELATIONSHIP. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS A DEFEAT FOR WALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA WORK AND FAMILY COALITION. AND ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS OUR ELDEST AMANTE SPEAKING AS AN INDIVIDUAL. HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH ATTENTION TWO MINUTES EACH OF OUR THAT THE FOOTBALLER AND A REAL- BUSTAMANTE SO I DON'T SEE IF YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER. READ FIRSTLY GOOD MORNING CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY MY NAME IS A DEEPER WHILE I AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA WORK AND FAMILY COALITION AND A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD SUPPORTERS AND EIGHTY TEN TWENTY ONE ARE CURRENTLY POPULOUS AN EMPLOYEE TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK TO CARE FOR A SICK FAMILY MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA CAN ONLY TAKE ME FOR SPECIFIC FAMILY MEMBERS AND YOU IF YOU MARRIED AND I LEAVE LIVE THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY DOES NOT REFLECT THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF LGBT PEOPLE. IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CLOSE BONDS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS OUTSIDE OF OUR NARROW TRADITIONAL DEFINITION AT TEN FORTY ONE EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY OUR REPLY TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS FOR EQUIVALENT AT FAMILY AND EMPLOYEES LIFE THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ABOUT THE BELL THE BILL DOES NOT CREATE NEWMAN IT'S SIMPLY ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO TAKE THEIR EXISTING PAID SECOND FAMILY LEAVE TO CARE FOR THE PEOPLE THEY CONSIDER FAMILY MANY LGBTQ PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHUNNED BY THEIR FAMILIES AND I'VE WORKED HARD TO FORM NEW CHOSEN FAMILY AND STUDIES SHOW THAT ONE HALF OF LGBTQ PEOPLE TURN TO CHOSEN FAMILY TO CARE FOR THEM. BUT OUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF FAMILY LGBTQ PEOPLE ARE BEING DENIED LEAVE OTHER WORKERS ALREADY WRITTEN THE SECOND THING I WANNA POINT OUT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TYPICALLY THE MALL BEFORE THOSE PEOPLE THE LEASE OF LIFE CHANGING EDT REPORT THAT LESS THAN ZERO POINT 3% OF ALL DISABILITY AND KEEP THEM IN THE PLANE OUR TO CARE FOR EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS ZERO POINT 3% IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON BUSINESS BUT WE DO NEED IT IT'S CRUCIAL. THE LAST THING I WANT HIGHLIGHTED THAT CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY BEHIND ON THIS ISSUE THE US GOVERNMENT SIX STATES AND LOCALITIES INCLUDING LA HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED AN EXPANSIVE DEFINITION OF FAMILY IN THEIR LEASE NOT ONCE A LEADER IN LGBTQ RIGHTS CALIFORNIA NOW LAGGED BEHIND TO STAND BY OUR VALUES OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION.

THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON NOW- MISTER CARE MEMBERS WHO COULD ACTUALLY HOPPING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE EFFECTIVELY OPPOSED TO EIGHTY TEN FORTY ONE AS A JOB KILLER. I'M AS A RESULT OF THE BECAUSE THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC THERE ARE THIRTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT FEWER SMALLER BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THAN THERE WERE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY SMALL BUSINESS REVENUES DOWN STILL BY ABOUT THIRTY POINT 6% WITH SOME INDUSTRIES REVENUE DOWN BY MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT. BOTH SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES ARE STILL FIGHTING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN AND MAKE A WHILE. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP OPERATIONS GOING EMPLOYERS OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE LEAVE HAS INCEASED OVER THE PAST YEAR ONE OF THE MOST. SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANSION DURING COLD IT WAS THE EXPANSION OF THE FOR JUST THREE MONTHS AGO SB THIRTY EIGHTY THREE AT THE END OF THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST SO THAT IT NOW APPLIES TO SMALL BUSINESSES WITH FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES. SB THIRTY THREE ALSO EXPANDED THE LIST OF FAMILY MEMBERS FOR WHICH AN EMPLOYEE COULD TAKE ME TO PROVIDE CARE BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES HE FOR NO LONGER RUN CONCURRENTLY WITH ITS FEDERAL COUNTERPART THE FMLA. BETWEEN THE TWO STATUTES AND EMPLOYEE COULD BE OUT OF WORK FOR SIX MONTHS AND THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE NO DISCRETION TO DENY C. FOR OR FMLA OR ASK AN EMPLOYEE TO MODIFY THAT LEAD. TO CALM THE OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE OUT. NOW JUST THREE MONTHS AFTER SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE EXTENSION AB TEN FORTY ONE SEEKS TO EXPAND IT AND THE HEALTHY WORKPLACE HEALTHY FAMILY ACT EVEN FURTHER. THE BILL BROAD PROVISIONS WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO TAKE CARE FOR ANYONE OF THEIR CHOOSING AN EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE NO ABILITY TO CHALLENGE AN EMPLOYEE'S ASSERTION THAT THEY CONSIDER NON RELATIVE TO BE LIKE FAMILY TO THEM. THERE'S ALSO NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT EMPLOYEES CAN TAKE CARE TAKE LEAVE TO CARE FOR. CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES CANNOT AFFORD A NEW BURDEN FAMILIES MANDATE EMPLOYERS MUST ALREADY PROVIDE A MYRIAD OF PLEASE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW INCLUDING PAID SICK LEAVE A SECOND ROUND OF THE NINETEEN SICK LEAVE EXCLUSION PAY. CHILD CARE LEAVE CRIME VICTIM LEAD PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE C. FOR LEASE FMLA LEAVE ANYBODY MARK PROPONENTS. OF THE BILL POINT TO DATA FROM HE- ARE YOU THAT LEAVES NOT BECAUSE- YOUR- SAYING THAT THERE. FEW OF. TO TAKE THEIR CLEAN. PERSPECTIVE ONLY REC. AND INTO LEAVE ANSWER PAID FOR. LEAVE I AM. AND BROUGH EDT. THEIR OFF IT DOES NOT. EMPLOYEES TOOK LEAVE AND THEN NOT TO GO BENEFITS OR- INSTEAD. OTHER EMPLOYER PROVIDED BENEFITS. I THINK IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT EMPLOYEES COULD TAKE TO GUARANTEE CALLED WEEKLY BOX. TO CARE FOR SOMEONE OTHER THAN A PARENT TRAVIS. AND WITH THE INCREASING AVAILABILITY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO THAT DO USE THAT IS SURE TO INCREASE AND THIRD. THAT DATA IS FROM THE C. FOR APPLY ONLY TO BUSINESSES OF FIFTY PLUS EMPLOYEES WHICH IS GREATLY EXPANDED THREE MONTHS AGO. REGARDLESS LEADER COSTLY FOR EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY OUR SMALLEST EMPLOYERS. AND EXPECTED ABSENTEEISM COSTS ABOUT THIRTY SIX HUNDRED PER EMPLOYEE PER YEAR FOR DISPATCH. AND WHILE THAT MIGHT SEEM A LOT. TO SOME SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE DOWN 30% IN REVENUE THAT THIRTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IT'S A FAIR TRIAL. FURTHER WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS TO TAKE LEAVE TO CARE FOR SOMEONE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY. MANY OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE ALREADY COVERED UNDER EXISTING LEAVE. POLICIES FOR AND THE HEALTHY WORKPLACE HEALTHY FAMILY ACT ALREADY ALLOWS CARE FOR A CHILD. IN THERE SOMEONE WHO STANDS IN THE SHOES OF THE PARENTS OF THAT CHILD. OR TO CARE FOR A PARENT LIKE FIGURE WHO STOOD IN THE SHOES OF THE PARENTS AND AS A CHILD. A BIOLOGICAL OR LEGAL RELATIONSHIP IS NOT NECESSARY IN EITHER OF THOSE SITUATIONS TO QUALIFY. FOR DIFFERENT ARCADE SICKLY. WITH MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF PROBLEMS. STILL AND THE EXPANSION OF THE FRIDGE THREE NINE AGO NOW NOT THE- TO AGAIN IMPOSED. YOU MANDATE ON HEALTH EMPLOYER. FOR THIS REASON NOT THE PUBLIC AB FORTY ONE AS A JOB KILLER. THANK YOU.

SECOND OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION I GUESS I REQUEST PLEASE SO IT AND I TOTALLY RESPECT AND AGREE WITH ARE MY COLLEAGUES FROM- FROM SAN DIEGO- ON ON THE DEFINITION AND THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE- IF THAT DEFINITION IS A NARROW- JUST CONCLUDE ANYBODY. THAT THE EMPLOYER DOESN'T REALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- NOR DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK- THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY IS JUST USING THIS. AS A MEANS OF YOU KNOW IT'S TAKING THREE WEEKS OFF TO GO VISIT THEIR SICK FRIEND IN MAUI- DURING CHRISTMAS WHEN THEY CAN'T GET OTHER TIME OFF. AND IN IN THOSE KIND OF. LOOSE DEFINITIONS ALLOW FOR HAT KIND OF ABUSE AND THAT KIND OF ABUSE. IS WHAT IS THE BUSINESS KILLER THAT THEY TALK ABOUT- AND ALSO IN THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE WORLD- THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT COST. AGAIN TOP COST TAXPAYERS. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OVERTIME COSTS- IT DOES I WORKED THERE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I DO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH IT COSTS. AND SO- SO IT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SUPPORT IT WITH WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO BROAD. AND BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE CHANGING DYNAMICS OF FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS. AND IN THAT FAMILIES ARE NOW NOT REALLY AS WELL DEFINED AS THEY WERE BEFORE I HAVE A VERY EXTENDED FAMILY ALSO. AND IN UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL AS ANYBODY- SO- SO YOU KNOW IT. IS THEIR LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT HELPS. WITH THAT SO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS A MEMBER WARD WILL CERTAINLY ADD YOU AS A CO AUTHOR- AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHILE THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO FRAUD AND I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS WIDESPREAD FRAUD IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM- AND IT DEFINITELY WITH IN THIS SPECIFIC BILL- IT REQUIRES A DOCTOR'S NOTE SO IT CANJUST BE SORT OF LIKE RANDOM NEIGHBOR WANTS TO GO TO HAWAII FOR THREE WEEKS- THERE NEEDS TO BE SERVED DOCUMENTATION TO ENSURE THAT THE PERSON WHO'S- CARING FOR THAT PERSON- IT IS LEGITIMATELY ABLE TO DO SO AND IS DOING SO. AUTHENTICALLY AND I WILL SAY YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE SPOKEN SERVICE OR ELSE FINISH UP WE YOU KNOW WE SPOKE TO THE CHAMBER CONTAINING TO MEET WITH THE CHAMBER AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO. I THINK ARE MOST IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW ONCE THIS GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE IT HAS TO GOTO ANOTHER COMMITTEE AS WELL I'VE SPOKEN TO THE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE. SO IT IS STILL VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE SITE AND ALSO IF YOU CAN ENSURE THAT- THE HIPPA REQUIREMENTS DON'T GET THROWN IN THERE AS AN OBSTACLE- WITH A DOCTOR'S EXCUSE. SAYING SOMEBODY IS ILL. AT THE AVERAGE OF THAT VIOLATE THEIR HIP A REQUIRED MADERA HIPAA PROTECTIONS SO- SO ANYWAY I. APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU THINK. THANK YOU THIS AMERICAN. REGIS WANNA MAKE THIS DOESN'T EXPAND PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES BY RIGHT DOES THAT NOW. OKAY SO. JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH CONFUSION ON ON- FAMILY LEAVE UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY OF OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. INCLUDING TEACHERS AND COUNTY EMPLOYEES COUNTY SAN DIEGO. DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO- THIS WOULDN'T BE A BURDEN ON ON TAXPAYERS IN THAT WAY- I ALSO WANT TO. MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS IS PAID FOR BY THE WORKERS THEMSELVES OUT OF PAYROLL TAX CREDITS. THE SO WITH THAT THANK YOU I ASSUME THIS WOULD BE A VERY. SMALL PERCENTAGE AND WHAT IT REALLY BURDEN THAT THE STI AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. FUND CORRECT IT'S A VERY SAD WE EXPECTED TO BE A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE IT TAKE IT UP BUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO VERY IMPORTANT. I DO I WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEFINITION- I THINK THAT THAT DOES NEED TO BE TAKEN UP AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT- OUT OF. AT APPROPRIATIONS SO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THANK. YOU GOT A JUDICIARY SORRY WE GOT WE GOT A INSURANCE THIS ON THOSE. OKAY SO NOTHING'S WILL GET BY THE TIME YOU GET THERE. I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT. I'D EXPECT A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER GENERATION THAT'S IT BUT- I'M- GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR ALL THE COMMON AND YOU SOME. WORK A YOU KNOW THE- THANKS AGAIN THIS LAST YEAR I THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT. BOTH IN TERMS OF THE BILITY OF A- I GUESS IT'S CALLED A SILVER LINING WHERE FOLKS BEEN A VOLUNTARY CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONS MAYBE.

I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECT FAST FOR NEIGHBORHOOD THANK YOU- EXECUTIVE ROLE ON A. B. TEN FORTY ONE. SHIN IS DUE PASSED TO INSURANCE KALRA HI KALRA HI FLORA FLORA KNOWN GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER- JONES SAWYER AYE RADIUS. RADIUS I SEE ARE THROUGH NOW SIERRA DON'T KNOW BOARD. WARD HI FILMS. THANK YOU AT THE BILL IT'S A PASS IT IS OUT AS BEEN GOING TO INSURANCE COMMITTEE. AND UP NEXT AB ELEVEN NINETEEN- THE PERSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF AB ELEVEN NINETEEN PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES BASED ON THEIR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES AN EMPLOYEE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR KNOWN FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE CLOSURES. FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION OCCURS WHEN AN EMPLOYER TAKES A NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT ACTION AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE TO CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER THIS INCLUDES MOTHER FOR MOTHERS AND FATHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN PREGNANT BREAST FEEDING A PEOPLE. AND EMPLOYEES WITH AGING PARENTS OR SIX PALACES OR PARTNERS THAT MAY ENCOUNTER FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES DISCRIMINATION ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ROUGHLY 60% OF TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLDS WITH AT ROUGHLY 60% OF TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN UNDER AGE UNDER AGE EIGHTEEN. HAVE BOTH PARENTS WORKING MORE THAN ONE IN SIX AMERICANS AMERICANS WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME REPORT ASSISTING WITH CARE OF AN L. ELDERLY OR DISABLED FAMILY MEMBER RELATIVE OR FRIEND AND WANTED TWELVE EMPLOYEE WHEN TWELVE- EMPLOYED ADULTS CARE FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ELDERLY OR DISABLED ADULTS. MOST EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES AT SOME POINT IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL LIVES EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS LIKE TERMINATION REFUSAL TO HIRE OR DEMOTION OR BEING PASSED UP FOR PROMOTIONS MAY BE BASED ON BIASES ABOUT HOW WORKERS WITH FAMILY CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES WILL OR SHOULD ACT WITHOUT REGARD TO THE WORKERS ACTUAL PERFORMANCE. THIS TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION AFFECTS EMPLOYEES OF EVERY INCOME LEVEL RACE GENDER IN INDUSTRY WORKING MOTHERS LOW WAGE WORKERS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED ONE STUDY BY THE AMERICAN JOURNAL SOCIOLOGY FOUND THAT MOTHERS WERE 79% LESS LIKELY TO BE RECOMMENDED FOR HIRE. HALF IS LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED AND OFFERED AN AVERAGE OF ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS FOR THE SAME POSITION AS NON MOTHERS. MOST ALARMINGLY 80% OF THE NEARLY ONE POINT ONE MILLION WORKERS WHO DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE LAST SEPTEMBER WOMEN. EMPLOYEES ARE STRUGGLING TO BALANCE THEIR JOB AND CARING FOR THEIR FAMILIES. DISPARATE TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD NOT BE REASON FOR TERMINATION OR OTHER ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS. AND I'LL JUST SAY YOU KNOW YESTERDAY I WAS- IN THE MIDDLE OF MY DAY AND ZOOMING A LOT AND MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL CALLED AND SHE AS SICK. AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP WHAT I WAS DOING AND GO PICK HER UP- BUT I'M LUCKY AND WE ARE LUCKY BECAUSE WE HAVE STAFF AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. BUT FOR SO MANY OF OUR WORKERS WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WHAT IF YOU'RE A GROCERY STORE WORKER WHAT IF YOU'RE A NURSE WHAT IF YOU WORK AT. YOU KNOW A CAFE WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO IN THAT SITUATION HAPPENS AND SO THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE THOSE TYPES OF RESPONSIBILITIES. HAVE SOME FORM OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION SO THAT THEIR JOBS ARE NOT JEOPARDIZED AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORKERS ARE MEASURED ON THE OUTPUT OF THEIR WORK. I'M NOT THE PERCEPTION OF WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. WITH ME TO TESTIFY. IS LISTEN LIZ MORRIS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF HASTINGS CENTER FOR. WORKLIFE LAW AND ALMA FERRIES. THANK YOU OKAY SO EACH WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH LIZ MORRIS FOLLOWED BY ALMOST VARIOUS LISTS. YEAH THANK YOU CAN ALMOST GO FIRST SURE.

IT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. LIZ MARS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU. MY NAME OF BUT MORRISON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR WORK LIFE LAW UP WE JUST HEARD FROM ALMOST THIRTY A FAR TOO MANY WORKERS WITH FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES HAPPENING CRISIS OVER THE LAST YEAR WHEN THE PROFESSIONAL CARE PROVIDERS THAT THEY RELY ON TO GET TO WORK HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE THE COMPANY. MOTHERS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED WHAT THE HARSHEST IMPACT ON WOMEN OF COLOR SINGLE MOTHERS AND WORKERS IN THE PAINT JOB. NOT ONLY HAVE THEY SUFFERED THAT THEIR CHILDREN HAVE PROPER TOO. MANY WHAT HOMELESSNESS FOOD INSECURITY IN OTHER PLAGUE THE POVERTY. DURING THE PANDEMIC WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO CARING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THE ELDERLY AND FAMILY MEMBERS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE FAITH. HARPER ENGINE TWENTY. BETWEEN PROVIDING ADEQUATE CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES AND KEEPING THE PAINT JOB THEY NEED TO SURVIVE. BUT THESE CHOICES ARE NOT NEW. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FAMILY CAREGIVERS EXISTED LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE AND LIKELY TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THAT. AND CALIFORNIA IS BEHIND IN ADDRESSING IT NEARLY IS ALREADY PROTECTED BY A STATE OR LOCAL LAW THAT PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES THAT CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE LEFT OUT. THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE OTHER STATES SHOWS THAT FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION LAWS WORK FOR EMPLOYEES AND BUSINESSES ALIKE BY ENCOURAGING EMPLOYERS TO TREAT FAMILY CAREGIVERS BASED ON THEIR JOB PERFORMANCE INSTEAD OF FIRE WHICH HAS THE POWER TO BOTH SAVE JOBS AND AVOID POSSIBLE. AB ELEVEN NINETEEN IS IMPERATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY. IT WILL ENSURE FAMILY CAREGIVERS TYPICALLY WOMEN ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE WORK FORCE. HOTELLING FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES AND NOT A PRIVATE BALIK IF THE HARD AND NECESSARY WORK OF CARING FOR THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.

ANYONE CAN MAYES GENERATED JEWISH JUST SHOW SUPPORT FOR TODAY'S BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MOVEMENT OPPOSITION AND- IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE ASHLEY HOFFMAN'S ACTUALLY TO BE A NEVER REALLY. THANK YOU I COULD AFTERNOON AGAIN MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WITH ACTUALLY OPTED ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO AB ONE ONE ONE NINE AS A JOB KILLER I'M A LOT OF DISCUSSION SURROUNDING THIS BILL HAS BEEN ON THE PROVISION PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES OR PARENTS OR PROVIDE CARE TO OTHERS. I WOULDN'T REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY IS THE BILL'S EXPANSION OF THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IN THERE AFTER PRACTICE MANDATE UNDER THE HOT AND WHAT THAT PRACTICALLY WOULD BE FOR EMPLOYERS PRESENTLY YOU SEE HOW REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENT ONLY APPLIES TO EMPLOYEES AT THE DISABILITY ORGAN PLAY BUT CERTAIN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. AB ONE ONE ONE NINE EXPAND THIS REQUIREMENT FOR THE AN EMPLOYER MUST PROVIDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR ANY EMPLOYEE WHO HAD FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES. FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES IS BROADLY DEFINED UNDER THE BILL INCLUDES PROVIDING DIRECTED ONGOING CARE TO ANY MINOR CHILD THE CARE RECIPIENT THE DIRECT CARE IS NOT JUST LIMITED TO WOMEN WHO ARE CHILD CARE CENTER IS CLOSED AND IT APPLIES EQUALLY TO TRIAL TO SEVENTEEN AT THE GOT TO GO INTO ONE. CHARACTER VIA IS ANYONE RESIDING IN THE HOUSEHOLD FOR QUITE SOME THE EMPLOYEE FOR MEDICAL CARE OR MORE BROADLY RELIES ON THE EMPLOYEES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DAILY LIVING THERE FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WOULD BE ENTITLED TO ACCOMMODATIONS UNDER THE SPELL THAT WOULD INCLUDE ANY EMPLOYEE WHO IS A PARENT OF A CHILD UNDER EIGHTEEN AND ANY EMPLOYEE LIVING WITH ANOTHER PERSON WHO RELIES ON THEM IN SOME WAY. SO UNDER THIS BILL AN EMPLOYER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCOMMODATE ANY EMPLOYEE WHO FALLS INTO ONE OF THOSE TWO CATEGORIES THAT MEANS THAT A PARENT WHAT THE COMING LATE EVERY DAY AFTER TAKING THEIR CHILD TO SCHOOL OR LEAVE EARLY TO PICK UP A CHILD FROM SCHOOL CAN'T REQUEST ACCOMMODATION. APPARENTLY WANT TO TAKE A DAY OFF CARE FOR THEIR CHILD WITH OUR SPOUSES ON VACATION CAN REQUEST AN ACCOMMODATION AN EMPLOYEE WHO NEED TO DRIVE THE ROOMMATE TO AN APPOINTMENT CAN REQUEST THAT ACCOMMODATION AND AN EMPLOYEE WHO IMPACT THEIR C. FOR EVERITT MAILLET LEAVE CAN REQUEST MORE THAN THOSE TWELVE WEEKS. UNLIKE OTHER LEAVE SABRINA MORE COMBINATIONS UNDER FEET HIGH ARE NOT CAST THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCESSES DESIGNED FOR INJURED OR DISABLED WORKERS WHO NEEDED MODIFICATIONS. TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WORKING THERE IS NO SET HOURLY WE- OR- LET. EACH ISSUE. AS HIGH FACT. WHAT IS CONSIDERED. THAN COMMON. GET FROM COURSE TO. IT IS DEPENDENT ON THE INTO. AND EMPLOYEE AND THE END OF THE EMPLOYERS IN BATON. THERE ARE ALSO ARE. FORTY HOUR. A PROTECTED. UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY POINT EIGHT. FOR FIGURATIONS WERE CHILD NOT BE PICKED UP. OR IF THE SCORE CHILD CARE CENTER IS UNEXPECTEDLY CLOSED. FURTHER THINK PRODUCT CAN BE USED IN ONE TO TWO HOUR INCREMENTS WHERE A CHILD HAS. MEDICAL CONDITION AND THEREFORE NEED TO BE CARED FOR BY THE PARENT AND SMALL INCREMENTS OF TIME. ALTHOUGH NO PLAYER CAN TECHNICALLY TO NINE ACCOMMODATION IS NOT REASONABLE OUT OF FEAR OF LITIGATION MANY EMPLOYERS ACTUALLY HAVE VERY LITTLE ABILITY TO DO THAT. THIS ASSEMBLY HERE'S AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION OF TRYING TO CONTINUE BUSINESS OPERATIONS UNDERSTAFFED OR DECIDE TO TAKE IN A COMPANY IN WHO THEY CANNOT. REMOTE COMBINATIONS GENERATE SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ONE OF THE MOST COMMON SPECIES FOR THE D. FH TARGETS FILED IN TWENTY NINETEEN A WERE RELATED TO ACCOMMODATION. BUT OCCASION CAN FINANCIALLY DEVASTATED SMALL BUSINESS. WHO IS SUBJECTIVE HE HA. AND EVEN WHEN AN EMPLOYER DOES GRAND ACCOMMODATION THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A LOT. ABOUT WHETHER THE EMPLOYER SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE AND THE DISABILITY CONTEXT THERE'S BEEN EXTENSIVE LITIGATION ABOUT WHETHER SPECIFIC ACCOMMODATION SUFFICIENT. WHETHER THE EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO MORE ACCOMMODATION AFTER THE END OF THE PERIOD OF LEAVE OR CULTURAL CHANGE. EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY SMALL PLAYERS HAVE FACED MULTIPLE INCREASE LEADS TO MANDATE THIS YEAR. WITH MORE THAN 3637% OF SMALL BUSINESSES STILL BEING CLOSED. SMALLER PLAYERS SIMPLY CANNOT TAKE THIS NEW MANDATE ESPECIALLY ONE WITH NO LIMITATIONS ON TIME. AND THAT IS HIGHLY PRONE TO LITIGATION WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY. APPROACHED THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

AND AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO OTHER PARTIES IN Q. THANK YOU. I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SUMMER GONZALEZ. FIRST I MET WITH THE BILL BUT- I HAVE TO ADMIT AS YOU KNOW AND I WORKED IN THE SPACE FOR A LONG TIME. FIRST OF ALL JUST SO PEOPLE HOME NOW IF ANYONE IS CALLED AT WORK BECAUSE THEIR CHILD IS SICK YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE PAID SICK TIME. SO THAT WE DID THAT A FEW YEARS AGO. IT'S REALLY PART WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PAID SICK TIME BUT YOU CAN'T BE. STOPPED OR RETALIATED AGAINST FOR DOING SELF SO WE HAVE I HAVE THAT PROTECTION. MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THE ACCOMMODATION PORTION. BECAUSE THERE'S NO CASE LAW THERE'S NO RULE- IT'S SO DIFFERENT THAN THE- DISABILITY IT WHAT WE'RE USED TO. ALREADY WITH- THE MEETING AND- YOU KNOW YOU YOU LOOK AT MEDICAL RECORDS YOU YOU DECIDE WHAT CAN BE DONE THERE. THERE IS A PROCESS THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH NOW WITH WITH. WITH DISABILITIES THAT WE UNDERSTAND. I DON'T KNOW EVEN AS BOTH AT SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN AN EMPLOYEE WITH CHILDREN AND AN EMPLOYER WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY A COURT REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AND SO IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS BEEN DISCUSSED I ALMOST FEEL BAD SAYING THIS PUBLICLY WITHOUT. ADDRESS IT PRIVATELY PURCHASED. IS THERE A WAY TO GIVE EXAMPLES OR OR TO SPECIFY WHAT A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION WHAT WHAT THE RAM OF THAT IS I MEAN IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. BRINGING MY CHILD WITH ME TO WORK IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION- CHANGING MY SCHEDULE IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION GIVE ME PAID TIME OFF YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE COURTS WOULD ASSUME WOULD BE THE REASON ACCOMMODATION AND I THINK THAT THAT CAUSES A LOT OF FEAR I JUST. WOULD LIKE TO BE. TIGHTER IN WHAT WERE WERE SUGGESTING IS APPROPRIATE I JUST- I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD COME UP RIGHT NOW SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT MOST EMPLOYERS PROBABLY CAN'T EITHER. SO YES IN THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WORK THROUGH SHAREPOINT IT'S THERE'S A LOT TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT THERE RIGHT- TEMPORARY I THINK IS A PIECE OF IT. YOU KNOW- THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU KNOW I HAVE A JOB THAT. GET YOU KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TILL FIVE BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY MY CHILD GETS OUT OF SCHOOL THREE SO I'M GONNA SAY HEY I NEED ACCOMMODATION TO LEAVE AT THREE EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT STILL TO GET PAID FOR THAT TIME RIGHT. IT'S MORE IF IT'S TEMPORARY- SOMETHING HAPPENS WHERE THERE IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT MEANS IN ADDITION TO THAT- EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION IF IT MEANS- IMPOSING UNDUE HARDSHIP ON THEM SO YOU HAVE A- STORE WITH ONE EMPLOYEE THAT'S- AT A SEVEN ELEVEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. RIGHT LIKE THAT WOULD IMPOSE A HARDSHIP ON. YOU KNOW THAT STORE SO WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH. THESE DEFINITIONS AND I AGREE THEY NEED TO BE MORE FLESHED OUT- AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. AND ALSO SUGGESTED TO SCHOOL CLOSING BUT THAT'S NOT CLEAR I I'M JUST THINKING THROUGH ALL THE POSSIBILITIES SO. GIVEN THE DONALD'S AND- THERE'S A SCHOOL CLOSING IN ON A FEDERAL HOLIDAY AND SO EVERYBODY NEEDS AN ACCOMMODATION TO STAY HOME WITH THEIR CHILD. I'M RIGHT YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE THAT OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T WORK IN THE REAL WORLD AGAIN SO- I THINK THERE'S A TON OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS SPACE AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE TAKING US ON THIS IS. REAL I JUST. THINK WE HAVE TO THINK THROUGH. THE SPECIFICS. YEP AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT YOU KNOW ASSUMING WE GET THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE. YEAH THANK YOU. ARM WRESTLE THOSE EMOTIONS ARE SECOND. OKAY THANK YOU THE SERVER CERTAIN THANK YOU. SO N. FOLLOWING A LITTLE BIT ON MICHIGAN'S HOUSES CONCERNS- YOU KNOW THE EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT ALSO COVERS THE HIRING PROCESS- WHAT IS TO PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM INTERVIEWING FOR A JOB WHO HAS SO MANY RESTRICTIONS THAT THEY ACTUALLY CAN'T. BECAUSE OF FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY FUNCTION IN THAT POSITION. HOW IS THE EMPLOYER WHAT POSITION IS THAT PUT HIM IN FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE- EIGHT IF THEY SAY NO BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO THE POSITION BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE OBLIGATIONS ARE THEY NOW SUBJECT TO. BEING SUIT. YOU KNOW AGAIN I WOULD SAY I THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COMBINATION IT'S FOR TEMPORARY RIGHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE IT'S SORT OF AN ONGOING SITUATION WHERE WE KNOW EVERY DAY OUR KID GETS OUT OF SCHOOL TO THIRTY RIGHT- AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE WE'VE TALKED TO THE CHAMBER AND THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. I MEAN TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT I DON'T WANT TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- BUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE NEEDS WERE YOU DO YOU SEE AS AS OUR OUR WITNESS TESTIFIED DISCRIMINATION THAT DOES HAPPEN RIGHT WITHOUT HAVING SOME SORT OF NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FINISH OUT AND I THINK AGAIN SOME. BUSINESS CONCERNS ARE. THERE ONE LAWSUIT AWAY FROM NOT BEING IN BUSINESS SOMETIMES- AND IT IN OKAY. FROM FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIMENT I HARKEN BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN I WAS A KID MY SISTER GOT HURT ON THE PLAYGROUND MY MOM WHO IS A TEACHER BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY HAD TO COME AND GET HER AND TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR AND THEN WHILE SHE WAS AT THE DOCTOR I GOT HURT. AND SO MY DAD WHO IS ALSO A TEACHER HAD TO COME BACK AND GET ME- THEY HAD NO PROBLEMS DOING THAT IN THE PAST YEP AND I'M I'M HOPING THINGS DIDN'T CHANGE A WHOLE LOT. AN ENGINE ON THOSE DAYS THAT THEY HAVE THAT. THAT IS MISSED GONZALEZ HAD POINTED OUT THAT THEY HAVE THAT CAPABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT ALREADY. AND I JUST ON THE LAWSUIT- YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR STATES HAVE PASSED THIS ALREADY- ALASKA DELAWARE MINNESOTA AND NEW YORK AND THEY HAVE NOT SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN LAWSUITS- I THINK IT'S THE SAME. ODDS OF BEING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING SO IT'S VERY SMALL- BUT- AND WE ARE LOOKING TO THOSE STATES AS WELL TO FIGURE OUT. LESSONS LEARNED FROM HOW THEY HAVE DONE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT- WE'RE CRAFTING THIS THE RIGHT WAY. I THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS COMPETENT AS THE REAL WORLD COMPLICATED IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO SUMMER GONZALEZ IS POINT YOU KNOW- IT'S CHALLENGING AND I THINK THAT THIS IS THE COMMITTEE PROCESS FOR THAT REASON TO WORK ON THESE THINGS IS AN ALLEGED SHERRY HOPEFULLY NEXT- AND THAT COMMITTEE UNDER. SHAHRISTANI'S INTERCEPTORS GREAT JOB A DRILLING DOWN ON THESE ISSUES AS WELL SO- WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU A MADAM SECRETARY OF CALDERON AB ELEVEN NINETEEN PLEASE.

IN OUR OPINION I PRESENTS CHALLENGES PARTICULARLY THE PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THAT THE FINAL CERTIFIED PAYROLL RECORDS BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED ON THE FINAL DAY OF CONSTRUCTION- WE DO UNDERSTAND THE MOST FLOOR- IS WILLING TO WORK WITH OUR CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT DIALOGUE WITH HIM- TO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IT WITHOUT A FINANCES OR IF YOU CAN HAVE- A ROLL CALL ON AB TEN TWENTY THREE MOTION OF THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA HI KALRA AYE FLORIDA AYE FLORA AYE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER AYE RADIUS SIERRA HI SEATTLE I WARD. HI RIGHT. THE BILL IS UNDER PREPARATIONS. SIMILAR JONES SAWYER IS A BAFTA. NEW BILLS MOVED AND SECONDED. WHENEVER YOU ARE READY SIMER JONES SAWYER GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT ALLOWS HEALTH CARE WORKERS PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE TO OVERRIDE A HOSPITAL ALGORITHM IF IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT AND WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HOSPITALS REGULARLY USE ALGORITHMS TO HELP DECIDE THE BEST COURSE OF CARE FOR MILLIONS OF PATIENTS A YEAR. THESE ALGORITHMS AS HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO PUT TO INPUT PATIENT INFORMATION WHICH DIDN'T RETURNS WITH A PRESCRIBED COURSE OF TREATMENT HOWEVER ALGORITHMS ALGORITHMIC BIAS AND SPECIFICALLY RACIAL BIAS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY ARE WELL DOCUMENTED AND HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN RECENT YEARS AND TO THE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO RESEARCH THE STUDY THAT THE OUTPUTS OF A WIDELY USED HOSPITAL ALGORITHM- AND FOUND IT X. ZIP IT SIGNIFICANT RACIAL BIAS WHEN IT REFERRED BLACK PATIENTS TO EXTRA CARE PROGRAM. SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER TIMES THAN WHITE PATIENTS ALTHOUGH TECHNOLOGY CAN BE A HELPFUL TOOL. THAT THAT COMPLEMENTS THE SKILLS AND DECISION MAKING OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IT IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE INCREASINGLY PASSED LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE IMPLICIT BIASES OF INDIVIDUALS. SO I TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE MORE INGRAINED INTO OUR SOCIETY IS ONLY RIGHT THAT WE TAKE THE SAME STEPS TO ADDRESS ITS LIMITATIONS AS WELL. MAJOR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE ALREADY RECOGNIZED AS NEAT AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED SUCH PROTECTIONS IN THEIR OWN POLICIES. ULTIMATELY PROVIDING AS MANY TOOLS AS POSSIBLE TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF BIASES AND ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE WILL BE LIFESAVING. AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT PROMOTE PATIENT WELL BEING BY PUTTING THE TRUST BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS PROPERLY TRAINED TO DO THEIR JOBS AS WELL AS CREATING B. TALLY HAITIAN PROTECTION FROM THEIR EMPLOYER. JUST FOR QUESTIONING THE ALGORITHM WHEN NECESSARY WITH ME TODAY THE BRIDE TESTIMONY OVER THE PHONE IS TAYLOR JACKSON ON BEHALF OF THE BILL'S SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. AND JANICE- MERRILY WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- EACH WITNESS WILL HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES IN OF TAYLOR JACKSON IS READY SHE MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER TURN MEMBERS TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION PROUD SPONSORS OF EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. AS A FAMILY MEMBER JONES SAWYER SAID IMPLICIT BIAS IS A HUGE ISSUE IN HEALTHCARE AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT BIASES INHERENT. IN THE ALGORITHMS DEPLOYED ON A LARGE SCALE CAN HELP FACILITIES WHICH DO EVERYTHING FROM SETTING PRESCRIPTION PLAN DESIGNATING PATIENT ACUITY AND DETERMINING HOSPITAL DISCHARGE TIMELINE. UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEMS ARE CREATED AND IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT PROGRAMMING TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR STATE'S DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION. EIGHTY FIVE EIGHT DOES NOT REMOVE TECHNOLOGY OR CLINICAL ALGORITHMS FROM HEALTH CARE BUT RATHER EMPOWERS NURSES AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO CONTINUE WORKING FOR THEIR PATIENTS BEST INTERESTS. RATHER THAN BLINDLY FOLLOWING A COMPUTER SYSTEM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DOES NOT MEAN HEALTHCARE WORKERS WOULD BE FREE FROM OVERSIGHT MONITORING OR DISCIPLINE CALIFORNIA HAS STRONG HEALING ARTS LICENSING BOARDS THAT OVERSEE THEIR MEMBERS. AND DISCIPLINE SUSPEND OR REVOKE LICENSES WHEN APPROPRIATE AND THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THE CROP OF THE HOSPITALS WILL ALSO RETAIN THE ABILITY TO DISCIPLINE A WORKER FOR ENGAGING IN UNSAFE PRACTICES. EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT SIMPLY INSURANCE AT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CAN DISAGREE WITH THE CLINICAL ALGORITHM TO MAKE THE BEST TREATMENT DECISION FOR THEIR UNIQUE PATIENT WHEN IT IS THAT WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. WITHOUT FEAR OF PUNISHMENT FROM THEIR EMPLOYER SOLELY FOR THE DECISION TO OVERRIDE AN ALGORITHM. AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT ALSO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER WORKER ENGAGEMENT WITH TECHNOLOGY THE HOSPITAL. ASKING THAT WORKERS BE NOTIFIED WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTING THEIR JOB IS BEING BROUGHT IN. THAT WORKERS GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SOME INPUT ON WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS SELECTED. AND THAT EMPLOYERS PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. HEALTHCARE TREATMENT IS NEVER A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FORMULA AND STRONG LABOR CODE PROVISIONS UNDER THIS BILL WILL MEAN THAT HEALTHCARE WORKERS PRIORITY CAN REMAIN THEIR PATIENTS. FOR THAT REASON THEIN I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. THANK YOU. UP NEXT GEN- MAY. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER MALLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT ECHO THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS PRESENTING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON MINORITIES IN TERMS OF SECTION REYES HOSPITALIZATIONS AND MORTALITY SOME BELIEVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A SOLUTION TO GUIDE CLINICAL DECISION MAKING FOR THE NOVEL TO FEES. RESULTING IN THE RAPID DISSEMINATION OF UNDERDEVELOPED AND POTENTIALLY BIASED MODEL WHICH MAY EXACERBATE IT DISPARITIES GAP. THERE IS HOPE THAT AI CAN HELP GUIDE TREATMENT DECISIONS WITHIN THE CRISIS IT GIVEN THE PERVASIVENESS OF. A FAILURE TO PRACTICALLY DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION STRATEGIES GROWTH EXACERBATING EXISTING HEALTH DISPARITIES. AS ANYONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOTE EVERY PATIENT IS DIFFERENT NURSES AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE EMPOWERED TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THEIR PATIENTS. AND FREE FROM FEAR OF RETALIATION FROM THEIR EMPLOYER FOR GIVING OUT WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE IT DOES. EIGHTY EIGHT FRIDAY TO SOUND POLICY FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS RIGHT BUT ALSO FOR PATIENT SAFETY. AND SETS US ON A PATH TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ETHNICITY. ECONOMIC STATUS. RECEIVE THE BEST CARE FOR THEM NOT THE BATH CARE AND DETERMINED BY A FORMULA OR AN ALGORITHM. THE LABOR FED IS PROUD TO SUPPORT EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE LEGISLATION OKAY. THANK YOU. I'M DOING HAVE MOVE ON A PUBLIC COMMENT AND AGAIN THE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THE FOLKS WHO STATE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION POSITION ON THE BILL. OTHERS NO ONE IN THE ROOM- ANYONE REMOTE TEST MY STATION. IF NOT A MISTER MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT ON THE PHONE. Q. THE STATE'S SUPPORT FOR A BI EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT ON THE PHONE LINES PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AGAIN THAT COMMANDERS ONE FOLLOWED BY. ZERO WE'LL GO TO OUR LOAN LINE THIS LINE EIGHTY FOUR EIGHT FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON TERRY MEMBERS THAT THIS JACQUI GRANT WHILE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR WITH UPW AFTER DATE COUNSEL IN STRONG SUPPORT THANKS. THANK YOU. NO FOR THE LINES AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU OF ALL MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION. DR JAMES LEO ON THE PHONE AS WELL AS ALEX HAWTHORN AND SO WE CAN GO AHEAD AND START. WITH DOCTOR LEO. FEES READY. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE KALRA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR JAMES LEO AND CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR MEMORIAL CARE FOR HOSPITAL INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I'M A PRACTICING INTERNAL MEDICINE AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE SPECIALIST AND HAVE OVERSIGHT OF CLINICAL QUALITY AND EVIDENCE BASED BEST PRACTICES FOR MEMORIAL CARE I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE. MAINTAINING QUALITY OF CARE AND SAFETY FOR PATIENTS AND STAFF OF GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR ALL CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS EVERY DAY. WELL THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROMOTE PATIENT SAFETY AND WORKER PROTECTIONS WE COULD IN FACT DO THE OPPOSITE. WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS ON WARRANTED AND REPLICATES EXISTING REGULATIONS IN BOTH THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. AND HEART COLLECTIVITIES WITH HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DECISION SUPPORT- ALREADY IN PLACE. THIS BILL IS PREDICATED ON THE IMPLICIT BIAS FOUND IN AN ALGORITHM USED BY OPTUM INTO FINDING OUT PATIENTS TO HIGH INTENSITY OUTPATIENT CARE. TO AN ALGORITHM THAT DEALS WITH CLINIC PATIENTS NOT WITH HOSPITAL PATIENTS. IF THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL HAVE PAINTED HOSPITAL CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS WITH A BROAD BRUSH OF IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH IS UNWARRANTED. THE ALGORITHMS ARE TEENS DEVELOP ARE BASED ON THE HIGHEST QUALITY MEDICAL EVIDENCE FROM MEDICAL LITERATURE. IN OUR DEVELOPED BY A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF DOCTORS AND HOSPITAL STAFF INCLUDING NURSES AND PHARMACISTS. SECOND THE ALGORITHMS WE USE TO GUIDE CARE IN HOSPITALS ARE RARELY PRO SCRIPTED AND NEARLY ALWAYS ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS TO OPT OUT WITH GOOD CLINICAL JUSTIFICATION. IN THE RARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SUCH CHOICE IS NOT OFFERED IT IS BECAUSE OF PATIENT SAFETY DEMANDS THAT. BUT EVEN IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ALGORITHM UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. OUR HEALTH SYSTEM LEADERSHIP HAVE A DEEP AWARENESS OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN HEALTH CARE AND AN EQUALLY DEEP COMMITMENT TO DISCOVERING AND REMEDYING THAT WHEREVER WE FIND IT. ALL BEST PRACTICE TEAMS THAT DEVELOP WORK WITH CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT PROTOCOLS ARE CHARGED WITH EVALUATING KEY CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. YOU CAN ALREADY INCLUDE REPRESENTATION FROM HOSPITAL STAFF IN THE FORMATION OF THE ALGORITHMS. EDUCATION ON NEW ALERTS AND SUPPORT TOOLS IS PROVIDED TO STAFF BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT CHRONIC CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS HAVE BECOME A KEY METHOD FOR HOSPITALS TO USE TO HELP SPREAD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE BASED BEST PRACTICE. THIS BILL WOULD TAKE A GIANT STEP BACKWARD IN QUALITY OF CARE BY ENCOURAGING WHOLESALE REJECTION OF CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES WITHOUT ANY REQUIREMENT FOR SUPPORTING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. THIS WOULD CREATE A DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT FOR PATIENTS BY ENABLING AN EMPLOYEE TO IGNORE WITH IMPUNITY CLINICAL DECISION ALGORITHMS AIMED TOWARD PROMOTING PATIENT SAFETY AND IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES. HOSPITALS ARE LIABLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES NONE OF THIS BILL WOULD FACE THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE. OF ONGOING LIABILITY FOR VIOLATION OF PATIENT SAFETY RULES. RELIABILITY FOR DISCIPLINING AN EMPLOYEE WHO IGNORES THEM WITH A CLAIM OF CLINICAL JUDGMENT FOR THE ALGORITHM IS BIASED. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON AB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND ALEX HAWTHORN ONLINE. THANK YOU YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR OUTSIDE OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THE FULL DETAILS OF OUR OPPOSE POSITION ARE IN THE LETTER TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE- I WILL SEE THAT TIME THOUGH- TO ARTS THE EXPERT WITH WITNESS DR JAMES LEO AND I CAN HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THOSE OPPOSED. NAME AFFILIATION POSITION ON THE BILL THE ONE IN THE ROOM. MOTETS TWENTY STATION. MOVEON MISS MODERATED THE EVERYONE IN OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT ON THE PHONE. THE STATE OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AGAIN USING YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD THAT'S ONE AND ZERO. OVER THE LINE ONE THIRTY SIX ONE THREE SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU RIGHT VENTURE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA PUT THE ATTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN IS JUST NINE WELL WE DIDN'T SUBMIT A FORM OPPOSE WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS PARTICULAR TO RETAIN TO THE FINAL WORD OF THE OVERSIGHT APPROVAL AND THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. TO THE FORTY TWO YEAR DISCUSSION THAT THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO OTHER LINES IN Q. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE DO HAVE A COMMOTION. ON THE FLOOR ALREADY IS THERE ANY FURTHER COMMENT OR QUESTION. THE CIVIC CENTER PARK. RIGHT NOW PLEASE. I'M TRYING TO GET  GRASP ON THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A REAL WORLD APPLICATION OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- IT'S HARD FOR. MEDICAL STAFF WE CAN'T LET THEM GO RENEGADE ON EVERY SITUATION HOWEVER WHAT I'M SEEING IN THIS BILL AND I'M TRYING TO SEE IF THAT'S THE INTENT. IS ALLOWING. MEDICAL STAFF TO INNOVATE IN IRAN AND TO THIS AS IN THE FIELD- TO SOMETIMES. RECOGNIZE THAT THE ALGORITHM ISN'T GOING TO WORK. AN OPERATING BASED ON THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND HAVING A GOOD OUTCOME FOR THAT PATIENT IS THAT WHAT THIS IS AFTER. HE ADDED IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT REAL LIFE JACOB STANCE- I'LL USE MYSELF BECAUSE WE WANTED THINGS THAT WERE WORKING OUT WITH CMA IS KIND OF THE OVERRIDE DECISION WHO DEAL IN IT YOU KNOW- YOU'VE YOU'VE BEEN IN THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S GOT TO BE ONE PERSON RISKS AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE THE ADULT TO MAKE THAT DECISION. SO I'M WORKING WITH CMA AND THE NURSES TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS AMOS COMMITTED SOME LANGUAGE- THE DAY DID QUITE LIGHT BUT WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON THAT- I'M A DIABETIC. MMHM AND WHEN I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED BY DOCTOR HE IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OF THE ALGORITHM WHEN YOU GIVE ME INSULIN- MET FOREMAN AND ALL THE OTHER MARRIED OF THINGS- AND I JUST REFUSE TO TAKE. ANY MEDICATION TRIED TO DO IT. MYSELF AND IT WASN'T WORKING TO ONE DAY A NURSE WITH THE LAST NAME DONNELLY WHOSE. BROTHER USED TO BE THE LEAD TO TEN A GOVERNOR GRABBED ME IN A ROW WE START ARGUING IT SHE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO. I LOST FORTY POUNDS I'M OFF OF. INSULIN AND I'VE CUT MY MET FOREMAN IN HALF FOR THAT TEAM THE ONE THE ALGORITHM THAT THE DOCTOR USED. TO KIND OF LOOK AT ME AS A BLACK MAN. WE SIR PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. NEED TO GET THIS KIND OF CARE AND THIS KIND OF MEDICATION AS OPPOSED TO. REGINALD BYRON JONES SAWYER SENIOR. COULD DO THIS ALTERNATIVE TYPE OF A- REMEDY WHICH A NURSE OFFERED TO ME WHICH PROBABLY SAVED MY LIFE AND SO THIS IS WHAT THIS KIND OF DOES IS WE NEED TO WORK AS A TEAM SOMETIMES THE ALGORITHM OR SOME TYPE OF THE DOCTOR SAYS WORK SOMETIMES. THE NURSE WORK- IN SOME WAY YOU MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO AVOID HAVING A SECOND A THIRD OPINION BY USING ALL THREE IN THE SAME PLACE SO THIS IS WHAT THIS GETS TO MAKING SURE THAT. EVERYBODY'S WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM TO GET THE BEST MEDICAL OUTCOME. YEAH GET THE KIDS I'M AN INCLINE ALTHOUGH THERE IS CONCERN WITH I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT- MOSTLY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE SEEN OUT THERE IN THE IN THE FIELD. AND WHERE ARE YOU IN I CAN NAME ONE PERSON WHO IS ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE OF IT. AND THEN BECAUSE WE ACT WE ACTED OUTSIDE OF THE ALGORITHM. AND AND SAVE THE GUYS LIFE TOOK A LOT OF CRAP FOR IT I'M SORRY WHAT. YEAH WE HAVE BEEN ULTIMATELY IT CAME DOWN TO AND THAT WAS THE THING IS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO TAKE A LICENSE YOU CAN BUT THAT GUY'S ALIVE BECAUSE- WE THOUGHT OUR FEET. AND SAVE THEM. AND SO YEAH YOU KNOW THE DATA THINK UP TO. THAT THE BIG ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH IN THE MEDICAL FIELD BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A CONTROL FACTOR THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY. IT CAN'T BE THIS FREE FOR ALL BUT- WHERE EVERYBODY JUST KIND OF DOING THEIR OWN THING OUT THERE SO. SO ANYWAY- STRUGGLED A LITTLE BIT BUT YOU KNOW I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISHMASH- CAPELLA JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE- LIKE AS- LIKE MEDICS IN THE FIELD RIGHT WE- OPERATE UNDER SO PEAS RIGHT UNDER A DOCTOR'S LICENSE. RIGHT AND IF SOMETHING IS GOING DIFFERENT WHETHER IT'S PAIN MEDS OR OR WHATEVER CARDIAC MEDICATIONS AT THE THIRD MINISTRY. YOU CAN GET PERMISSION YOU CAN CALL THE ON CALL B. R. DOC AND GET PERMISSION FROM A DOCTOR TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. TO WHAT YOUR RECIPES ARE WHAT YOUR ALGORITHM IS BRIGHT. SO I AM STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT LIKE. IF THAT ALREADY EXIST OUT THERE. IF WE CAN ALREADY DO THAT WHAT WHAT IS THIS WHAT WE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE- PURSES CAN ALREADY LIKE IF THEY SEE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T LOOK QUITE RIGHT. THEY CAN ALL RIGHT TO GO TO THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN SAY HEY THIS IS. GOING ON IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE S. O. P. SAYS. SO I GUESS I AM CURIOUS- IT ALREADY SEEMS LIKE THIS IS IN PLACE WE JUST MAYBE NEED TO EDUCATE. PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY. FONG AND I'M NOT I'M JUST CONFUSED I GUESS THIS IS ULTIMATELY WHAT I'M SAYING AT THE C. MAKING JUMPING BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT IS NOT AS UNIVERSAL AS YOU YOU WOULD. FOR DEMOCRATS AS A PERMANENT DAY MAY HAVE ACCEPTED A LOT OF THESE- METHODOLOGY BUT NOT EVERY HOSPITAL DOES AND WHAT THIS BILL. ADDRESSES ITS EXACT WHICH YOU'RE SAYING HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S KIND OF FOLLOWING THE SAME PROCEDURE STATEWIDE. CADETS UNDER OUR PURVIEW MAYBE IN YOUR AREA. EVEN WHEN YOU DID YOUR PRACTICE WHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE IN THE FIELD IT WAS SO WELL BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S NOT MISLEAD THAT WAY ALL THE WAY. AND IN RETALIATION PART IS REALLY IMPORTANT COULD YOU. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU. MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AND THE NEXT THING YOU LOSE YOUR JOB YOU'RE YOU'RE DISCIPLINED. AND YOU'VE SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE. FOR SURE. M. AND I THINK YOU MAYBE THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIKE. ATTICS IN THE FIELD VERSUS PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE CLINICAL SETTING AND PROBABLY SOME DIFFERENT DECIDED NOT USE THEIR AS WELL YEAH- I AM I'M GONNA- STRUGGLING WITH IT BUT I. IT IS IT'S INTERESTING TO ME SEVEN PROJECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YEAH THINGS ARE GOING ON FOR THAT THING TO. YOU KNOW THE- TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING HIS FATHER THEM'S DONE ONDERS IN THE MODERN MEDICINE ESPECIALLY GIVEN. THE PACE OF WORK. THE A LOT OF OUR- NURSES AND DOCTORS ARE UNDER THAT THEY HAVE TO RELY. ON ON SOME OF THE DATA AND SOME OF THEM AS YOU STATED DECEMBER. YOU KNOW AS THAT. DID TO GIVE A SENSE OF SETTING THE STAGE CAN WHAT IS. THE WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH HERE THEY CAN USE A LOT OF DATA POINTS AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY. IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT WE ARE. ALSO HAS SOME FAITH IN HIM AND THOSE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK THEY'RE NOT GONNA. GO ROGAN ABANDON THE TECHNOLOGY. ABANDONED ALGORITHMS- YOU KNOW JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT WHEN THEY REALLY SEE A NEED TO. AND WE ALSO NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALGORITHMS. WILL PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC BIASES. AND THAT'S A REALITY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. COST BEING A FACTOR. INCORPORATED INTO THOSE ALGORITHMS AND SO ALL OF US INCLUDING THOSE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD I THINK THOSE THAT. SPOKE IN OPPOSITION ARE VERY EARNESTLY WORKING. ON ROOTING OUT THE SYSTEMIC BIASES BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND THE REALITIES UNTIL IT DOES. ALGORITHMS ARE GOING TO INCORPORATE THE EXISTING SOCIETY THAT WERE IN INCLUDING THE DATA POINTS THE DATA THAT'S BEING IMPORTED. OVER MANY CASES MANY MANY YEARS- AND SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING- I DO THINK THAT YOU KOW THERE'S A COUPLE SUGGESTIONS THAT ARE. IN THE IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS TO TIGHTEN UP SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THAT- YOU'RE GOING IN A GOD DIRECTION- AND- IT'S ENCOURAGING TO HEAR EVEN SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. THE GROUP- SPENT OVER WORKING WITH YOUR WINE TO WORK MORE WITH YOU IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT GOING FORWARD. SO WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

HOWEVER THE LACK OF AWARENESS OF THIS BUSINESS MODEL AND ITS BENEFITS HAS BEEN A MAJOR BARRIER TO REFORMING WORKER COOPS NEW WORKER COOPS ALSO FACED OBSTACLES DUE TO COMPLICATED STATE AND FEDERAL TAXES AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL AB THIRTEEN NINETEEN WOULD INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP BY CREATING AN OVERSIGHT BODY THAT IS ITSELF WORKER GOVERNED. TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE. I SHARED ADMINISTRATION MANAGERIAL AND OTHER FUNCTIONS AND COST BY THE FEDERATION WOULD HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR WORKER CO OPS OF ANY SIZE. AB THIRTEEN NINETEEN IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO SCALE UP WORKER COOPERATIVES- THE WORKER COOPERATION MODELING CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL HELP MOVE THE STATE TOWARDS AN INCLUSIVE AND RESILIENT ECONOMY BY CENTERING ON WORKER OWNERSHIP INVESTING IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEX TECHNICAL ASPECTS RELATED TO FARMING SUCH- WORKER COOPS SUCH AS- GRADING BYLAWS REGISTERING THE CORPORATION NAME GOVERNMENT- AB THIRTEEN NINETEEN IS IMPORTANT STEP TO HELP HELP CLOSE AN EQUITY AND SPUR ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND BY ESTABLISHING A FEDERATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO NEW AND EXISTING CO OPT OUT FOR THE THREE THAT THAT YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA IS PROUD TO SPONSOR.

THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN INCREASING ANNUALLY. HISTORY FARMWORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LARGELY RECRUITED IN MEXICO ARE TIED TO A SINGLE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYER. OF WHO PROVIDES THEM WITH HOUSING MEALS AND TRANSPORTATION TO WORK SITES. MANY H. TWO A. WORKERS HAVE NEVER BEEN TO CALIFORNIA BEFORE AND EITHER SPEAK OR READ ENGLISH.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CYNTHIA RICE AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE WE PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES TO RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH AN EMPHASIS ON REPRESENTING FARMWORKERS INCLUDING H. TWO A. WORKERS WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE MANY OF THE H. TWO A. WORKERS COMING IN ARE DOING SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE EMPLOYERS CONTROL WHERE WHEN DID THEY GET INTO THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY LIVE. WITH THEIR ROOMMATES ARE. AND AFTER EMPLOYER PROVIDED HOUSING THEY ARE ASSIGNED A BUS OR VAN AND A TIME TO GET ON IT. IN THE MORNING AND ARE IN THE FIELDS AND OTHER EMPLOYER SENT A BUS TO PICK THEM UP AT NIGHT. IN OUR H. TWO A. CASES WHEN A WORKER PRESENTS THE PROBLEM IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL VIOLATIONS MOST OF WHICH THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT. AND OUR UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA LAW. THESE INCLUDE UNPAID TRANSPORTATION TIME UNPAID OVERTIME DENIAL OF MILLER REST PERIODS UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS. THE LACK OF SHADE WATER AND NON COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS AND HOUSING STANDARDS. INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CONTROLLING EIGHT COVERED NINETEEN EXPOSURE. WHEN WE EXPLAIN THESE RIGHTS TO WORKERS ARE FRANKLY SHOCKED THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED PROTECTIONS AND ROBBED OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF. DOLLARS TO PAY THAT THEY HAD NO. KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD THE RIGHT TO. THIS BILL PROTECTS H. TWO A. WORKERS BY ENSURING THAT THEY KNOW THEIR RIGHTS. INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PAYMENT FOR EMPLOYER CONTROL TRANSPORTATION. WHAT OTHER CONTRACTS IN PLACARDS ON THE BUS OF THE STATE THAT THEIR TRANSPORTATION IS VOLUNTARY IT IS ANYTHING BUT AND THE FAILURE TO PAY FOR THAT TIME IS WAGE THEFT. THIS IS TACITLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE GROWERS AND FARM LABOR CONTRACTOR WHICH WOULD SETTLE THESE CASES WITH US. FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAYING THE WAGES OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED BUT NOT PAID.

BOB ROBERT MITCHELL OPERA CAL CHAMBER AND WE ALONG WITH A BROAD COALITION OPPOSED AB SIXTY FOUR- TO BE CLEAR THE BILL IN ITS PRESENT DOES ONE THING IT IT REQUIRES G. P. H. CRITICIZED THE CIVIC LISTED EVERY OUTBREAK. BOB I HEARD THE AUTHOR MENTIONED- BOARDING DUPLICATIVE REPORTING WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR THAT THEY KNOW THEY OFFERS INTEREST NOT FRONT THOUGH I SHOULD NOTE THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S TECHNICALLY IN THE BILL PRESENTLY- OUR POSITION IS BASED ON. TWO KEY ELEMENTS ONE THE LIST UP BREAK THIS BILL THEN BE CREATING WILL NOT HELP PUBLIC HEALTH AS WE READ AND TO. CHANGE BUSINESS INSTRUMENT THEY CANNOT CONTROL. TO THE FIRST POINT- THE REQUESTED NOT SEPARATE GOOD BAD EMPLOYERS DISTRACTIONS- TO BE CLEAR EMPLOYERS EVEN THOSE UP PERFECT COMPLIANCE EVERY STATE LOCAL AND COUNTY GUIDANCE DOCUMENT CONCORD NINETEEN. CAN EXPERIENCE OUTBREAK BASED ON THE CONDUCT OF THEIR EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE OF WORK A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS A FEW EMPLOYEES OR CLOSE FRIENDS GO TO A DINNER PARTY IN A WEEKEND. AND THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE SAFE BUT NAY THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO COVER THE NEIGHBORING THAT'S THE WORKPLACE THAT NOW BECOMES AN OUTBREAK REGARDLESS OF WHAT ON IT SENATE THE WORKPLACE ANYWAY AND THAT LEAD TO THE EMPLOYER BEING LISTED HERE BUT THE EMPLOYER HAS LITERALLY DONE NOTHING. WRONG WITH THAT MERRY- SO WE ARE THE HAVE CONCERN WITH A LIST WHICH WE VIEW AS- IT. AND FRIGHTENING OFF CUSTOMERS FROM. BY THANK. THE REASON YOU DON'T BELIEVE THIS LITTLE THE PUBLIC HEALTH- V.

THANK YOU. NO FURTHER LINES INTO AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR MOTIONS. I REQUEST YES SERVERS ARE- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ALSO THAT I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT CDPH HAVE YOU COMMUNICATED WITH THEM ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO EVEN HANDLE THIS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS A REALLY QUICK- AS SOME OF THE SPEAKERS ARE POINTING OUT- IT NEEDS A REALLY QUICK TURNAROUND. AND I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING IN OUR STATE THAT HAS A REALLY QUICK TURNAROUND AT THIS POINT. SO HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM ABOUT THEIR ABILITY EVEN. HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF MAKING THIS TYPE OF THING EFFECTIVE. IT WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND ALSO WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THEY'RE GOING TO NEED. IT IF SOMETHING HAS TO BE ADDED- BUT THERE HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEM SO THEY'LL HAVE TO THE HOT DEAL RAMP UP TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. THE INFORMATION IS BEING PROVIDED TO THEM IT'S A MATTER OF PRO OF INCLUDING IT IN THE REPORTING. I THINK. FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR A YEAR NOW AND- I KNOW THIS IS A CLEAN UP BILL BUT- CURRENTLY. AN OUTBREAK AS THREE OR MORE CORRECT. IN THIS STATE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ABOUT LIKE NOT DICTATING WHAT PEOPLE CAN AND CAN'T DO RIGHT I MEAN WE LIVE AND LET LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO HOLD. THE BUSINESS ACCOUNTABLE FOUR THANK THE PEOPLE WHO OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE. AND THREE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS I MEAN IN MY DISTRICT HAVE LARGE EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES MULTIPLE FAMILIES MULTIPLE FROM THE SAME FAMILY. IF THEY'RE HANGING OUT AT A DINNER. OR IN THE BARBECUE IN THE BACKYARD AND THEY BRING IT TO THE WORKPLACE. HOW IN GOOD FAITH AND WE HOLD THE BUSINESS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE- I THINK IT'S A HUGE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THIS BECAUSE- WHEN IT COMES TO ADD IN MANUFACTURING IT IS VERY COMMUNAL. BUT A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE BUSINESS IS EXPECTED. IF THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEY FOLLOWED STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES TO PREVENT THIS SO I DO HAVE SOME MAJOR CONCERNS I WOULD LOVE IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THAT. THE CAPSULE I THINK THAT WHAT. SIX EIGHTY FIVE WAS ABOUT REPORTING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE KNEW WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. TO COVERT THAT'S WHAT'S EXCITING FIGHT WAS ABOUT. AND THEN IT WAS REQUIRING THE EMPLOYERS TO REPORT THAT SO THAT WE COULD KNOW WHERE THE OUTBREAKS WORK. AND AT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH- COULD THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AT THAT PARTICULAR EMPLOYERS LOOK LOCATION. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT. THAT THAT THAT THE EMPLOYERS RESPONSIBLE OR NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COVE IT IS JUST TALKING ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT THE THAT THE EMPLOYEE KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED THAT'S IT. WHAT THIS DOES IS IT MAKES SURE THAT WE SAY IT'S INDUSTRY AND WORKPLACE BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PUT IS WHAT. INDUSTRY WORKPLACE. AND IF THE ALTHOUGH AND IN THE ANALYSIS IT DOES SAY AB SIXTY FIVE PROVIDED A MECHANISM FOR DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO COLLECT. AND PUBLISH COBIT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS BY WORKPLACE AND INDUSTRY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT IT HASN'T BEEN DONE SO WE WANT TO CLEAR IT UP AND SAY WE ARE EXPECTING BOTH INDUSTRY AND WORKPLACE. THE SECOND PART TO THIS AND ONE OF THE- WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED AND SAID THAT THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T INCLUDE YET- DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE DUPLICATION AND THAT IS CORRECT IN THE LANGUAGES AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WE DON'T WANT. ANY OF OUR HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE THAT ALREADY HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT TO REPORT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE TO REPORT TWICE. SO THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF THIS CLEAN UP BUT IT'S THOSE TWO THINGS ONE IS. INDUSTRY AND WORKPLACE SO THAT IT ISN'T JUST INDUSTRY ON THE REPORTING BUT IT DOESN'T SAY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE WHO'S NOT RESPONSIBLE IT'S ONLY THE REPORTING IT'S ONLY BE GATHERING INFORMATION. AND THE SECOND PART IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT REQUIRING ANYBODY TO REPORT TWICE BECAUSE GOING TO TAKE THEM TOOK TWICE AS LONG IT MAY SEEM TO BE THE SAME REPORT. BUT IF THEY HAVE TO INPUT IT AGAIN IT WE DON'T WE THAT'S UNFAIR TO THOSE TWO THAT WAS LIKE MEDICAL FACILITIES AND THE LIKE TO HELP THEM. PREPARE TWO DIFFERENT REPORTS SO ONCE SOMETHING HAPPENS RIGHT THERE'S A OUTBREAK. AND THEY GET PUT ON THIS LIST RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS THEN. NOTHING IT'S JUST TO LET THE COMMUNITY KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK THERE. AS TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE OR NOT RESPONSIBLE THIS BILL AND MY PRIOR BILL HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHO'S RESPONSIBLE IT HAS TO DO WITH MAKING SURE THAT A WORKER KNOWS THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED. AND MAKING SURE THE COMMUNITY KNOWS WHEN THERE'S AN OUTBREAK AT ONE OF THE WORK PLACES IN THEIR COMMUNITY RIGHT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO PRINT. THE NAME OF A BUSINESS ON A- PUBLICATION THAT THE COMMUNITY KNOWS. THIS IS THAT CAN THAT BUSINESS IS BAD THEY'RE GOING TO. A QUOTE UNQUOTE BLACKBALLED FOR ONE WAY OR THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THEIR FAULT. JUST LIKE THE COMMUNITY I WOULD NEVER WANT LIKE INDIVIDUALS NAMES BEING PRINTED RIGHT THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE. AT THE HIPPA VIOLATIONS A LOT OF ISSUES WITH THAT. ON THE SAME SIDE THAT IF A BUSINESS IS FOLLOWING ALL THESE PROTOCOLS IN DOING THE RIGHT THING. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME PROTECTIONS IN THE FORM BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR TO HAVE THEIR NAME GETTING PUBLICLY SHAMED. ON SOMETHING THAT THEY CANNOT CONTROL NOW THEY'RE BAD ACTORS THAT ARE DOING NONE OF THIS. FAIR GAME BLOCK OF I'M GOOD. AND SO IT'S REALLY THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING EVERYTHING PROPERLY IN ORDER THAT I'VE GOT MY CONCERT WITH SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THANKS FOR. ANY OTHER CUSTOMERS WITH EMOTION. THE BILL. OKAY SOLUTION A SECOND. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN A LOT OF LAST YEAR IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC FOR YOU TO GET A BILL TO GET THAT THROUGH I THINK CRITICAL- AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT BEING EMPLOYEE EMPLOYERS THIS IS ABOUT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE. BUT IF THEY KNOW IT OR NOT AND YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW IT. DOESN'T RISK ANDDO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND IT'S REALLY ESPECIALLY A WORKPLACE IS OBVIOUSLY A COMMON- A PLACE THAT I THINK FOLKS SHOULD KNOW. OF IF THERE'S BEEN ANY KIND OF BREAKS THEN THEY CAN TAKE A PROOF OF PROACTIVE STEPS. AFTER THEY AVE THE KNOWLEDGE BUT IF WE'RE NOT GIVING THEM THE KNOWLEDGE. THEY CAN'T TAKE A STEPS WOULD NOT DISTRACT THEMSELVES UP INTO OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO THAT'S WHY I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THIS AND- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY.
