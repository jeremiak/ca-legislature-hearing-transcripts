THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL TODAY THAT WILL. EXTEND COMPASSION TO TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. ON ON THEIR FACING TERMINAL ILLNESS. BEFORE I BEGIN THOUGH I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL FACILITIES. THIS BILL WOULD APPLY -- TO YOU KNOW THE THE HOPE IS THAT WE GIVE. RELIEF AND AND HELP TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT. RESTRICTING WHERE THEY CAN GO I MEAN ONE OF THE REASONS WE SELL SELECTED -- MISTER RYAN BARTEL IS GOOD YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE STATE OF WASHIGTON. TO BE -- TO GET ACCESS -- TO THESE -- THESE. THESE RIGHTS I THINK THAT ARE ARE A RIGHT RIGHTS OF EVERY PATIENT BUT HE COULDN'T GET A MINUTES OWN STATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN OUR STATE CAN STAY CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILIES. AND AND STAY CONSCIOUS TO STAY LUCID SO WERE ACCEPTING -- THE NUMBER THAT RESTRICTS MEDICAL FACILITIES WHICH WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE CAN STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT HAVING. TO INCLUDE ALL MEDICAL FACILITIES IT MIGHT NOT BE. SUITABLE TO THIS. I'M ALSO AGREED IN CONCEPT AND AND I AM FULLY COMMITTED TO WORK WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR -- TO WORKING WITH YOU AND AND YOUR WONDERFUL STAFF -- TO FUTURE AMENDMENT THAT WILL ALLOW FACILITIES TO SUSPEND COMPLIANCE WITH THE BILL. IF THE ENFORCEMENT POSITION OF FEDERAL AGENCIES CHANGE. IN THE FUTURE ON THE MEDICAL CRACKED ON A MARIJUANA AS WE KNOW IT'S STILL A FEDERALLY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AND THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS AND WE HAVE A GOOD RESPONSE TO WHY. WERE ALLOWING THIS. TO TO TAKE TAKE THE FACT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE VERY STRONG ARGUMENTS ON GOVERNMENT -- GIVE IT THERE'S A RIVER REVERSAL IN THERE FOR SPENT. I THINK OUR STATE -- WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THAT AND I WANNA MAKE THE BILL -- RESPONSIVE TO THAT BECAUSE I I I I THINK IT SHOULD BE. I ALSO I'D LIKE TO THANK -- SENATORS STEVE TONE AND HILL FOR ALL THEIR WORK AND SUPPORTING US -- NOT ONLY CRAFT THIS LANGUAGE CRAFT THIS BILL BUT ALL THE SUPPORT OF THEIR STAFF AND AND THEIR EXPERTISE IN ON THESE MATTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A WONDERFUL BILL.

THE THE AT THE END OF THE DAY -- WE HAVE TO GET THE LANGUAGE RIDE BUT AND HOUSE TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE -- CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN -- AN ENORMOUS PIONEER A NUMBER OF ADVANCEMENTS UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS DEEPLY OPENS MINDED STATE AN ENTREPRENEURIAL STATE MANY CALIFORNIANS. ARE STILL EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCING SHORTCOMINGS IN AND HELP. OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM AND OBTAINING -- ACCESS TO VERY IMPORTANT TREATMENTS I RUN NUMEROUS BILLS ON THAT OVER THE YEARS TO REALLY -- EXPANDABILITY TREAT PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO MORE. TO TO TREAT AND TO CARE FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. IN THIS CASE TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS AND DEEP SUFFERING WHO ARE RECEIVING CARE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. SOLUTIONS THE KERRY THE POTENTIAL TO OFFER THEM RELIEF IN THIS CASE -- IN IN IN RYAN'S CASE BATTLING CANCER THE ONLY CHOICE HE HAD WORK OR WOULD BE -- AIDS AND AND DOPING DRUGS THAT MADE HIM ON CONSCIENCE AND MADE HIM AND THAT. AND THAT -- BUT KEPT THE MOSTLY ASLEEP. IN YOUR FINAL DAYS YOU WANT TO BE LUCID YOU WANT TO BE CONSCIENCE YOU WANT. TO BE BE COMMUNICATIVE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE -- TO INTERACT WITH YOUR FAMILY AND ENJOY THOSE THINGS THAT YOU. FEEL YOU STILL HAVEN'T ENJOYED ANYTHING THAT WE CAN GIVE IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS. WE SHOULD BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO GIVE TO THEM AND AND THIS BILL WOULD MAKE MEDICAL CANNABIS AVAILABLE TO THEM. TO HELP THEM REDUCE NAUSEA VOMITING AND PAIN. AND OTHER -- AND BAND ON FOR THEM -- TO BENEFIT FROM A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS SAID -- MEDICAL MARIJUANA IS EFFECTIVE IN TREATING UNDER WE ARE A LOGICAL DISORDERS -- DEMENTIA EPILEPSY AND AND OTHER -- ILLNESSES THAT BODY OF ADAM EVIDENCE IS GROWING AS A GROWS. I THINK WE WERE GOING TO ME INSTEAD OF ANTICIPATING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A REDUCING I SEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- CHANGE IN THEIR POSITION ON MARIJUANA OF TERE ALREADY ARE -- THIRTY THREE STATES THAT ARE OFFERING MEDICAL MARIJUANA OR IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT INCLUDE MARIJUANA AS A TREATMENT TO PEOPLE WITH. MEDICAL ISSUES I THINK. WE'RE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE MOVE. EXPEDITIOUSLY TO OFFER THIS TO PEOPLE OF OUR STATE SO -- I THINK OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND THIS BILL -- I WILL KEEP I WILL TRY TO LIMIT MY COMMENTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOWING YOU TO GET TO A VERY FULL AGENDA TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE.

I WILL CHAIRMAN. COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JIM BARTEL. I AM THE FATHER RYAN BARTEL IN CLOSE AND SPONSOR OF RANTS LAW. SB -- THREE ZERO FIVE THREE COMPASSION ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES ACT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. BEFORE I CONTINUE I WANT -- TO TWO THINGS ONE TO POINT OUT A LETTER WE DISTRIBUTED FROM MY WIFE WHO JUST WASN'T UP. TO COMING HERE TO SPEAK BUT SHE DID HER THOUGHTS IN WRITING. AND THEN -- TO ALSO THANK SENATOR HUESO. FOR UTTERING A BILL. WHICH MEANS SO MUCH TO ME PERSONALLY. THANK YOU CENTER -- I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT RYAN'S WE CAN HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHO HE WAS AND WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS. SO IMPORTANT TO BE NAMED IN HIS MEMORY -- RYAN WAS ALWAYS A VERY ACTIVE AND COMPASSIONATE PERSON GROWING UP IN SANTEE CALIFORNIA. IN HIGH SCHOOL HE WAS AN EXCELLENT STUDENT GRADUATING A FOUR POINT ONE GPA ACTIVE IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES. AND SEVERAL SPORTS INCLUDING ALL STATE HONORS FOR CROSS COUNTRY A JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEARS. HE IS RECRUITED BY SEVERAL COLLEGES AND ATTENDED THE NURSING MEXICO AND RAN TRACK ACROSS ME THERE FOR FOUR YEARS. HE THEN UNLESS IN THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD ANSWERED HER FOR YEARS. HE'S VERY KATIE AND THEY HAVE A pSON CONNOR WILL BE TEN YEARS OLD ON APRIL. TWENTY SIX IN KATY BOTH WORKED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WITH MOSTLY AUTISTIC CHILDREN. AND YOU KNOW TO DO THAT JOB TAKES ONLY NALLEY SPECIAL SKILLS. BUT ALSO PATIENTS AND GREAT COMPASSION. BRIAN HAD ALL THOSE THINGS. AND LOVES HIS JOB. JACKIE TECH TALK ME WITH. LAST COUPLE WEEKS ABOUT HOW MUCH SHE WAS GOING TO MISS WORKING WITH THE KIDS. HE'S ALSO A LOVING HUSBAND AND FATHER WHO HAD A FASCINATION WITH STAR WARS AND LEGOS WHICH HE ACTIVELY SHARED WITH HIS SON CONNOR. THEY WOULD SPEND HOURS TOGETHER BUILDING STAR WARS MODELS IN COLLECTING ALL THE CHARACTERS. RYAN CONOR ALSO LOVE GOING TO MOVIES TOGETHER A WEEKEND IN FACT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER RIGHT PASSED AWAY. CONNOR WOULD NOT GO TO MOVIES ANYMORE WITH ANYONE. BECAUSE IN HIS WORDS THAT WAS MY SPECIAL THING I DID WITH DAD. AND MARCH FIRST OF LAST YEAR. RYAN CALLED ME AND MY WIFE TO TELL US THAT HE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE FOUR PANCREATIC CANCER. IN HAILING A FEW WEEKS TO LIVE. I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS HEARING. MY HEART SANK INTO SWELLED. HE TURNED FORTY TWO ON MARCH NINTH A DAYS LATER HE DIED ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST SEVEN WEEKS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED. ENSIGN CARTER NINE YEARS OLD FIVE DAYS LATER. NOT A GOOD TIME FOR US. WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY MARCH FIRST APRIL TWENTY FIRST IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY? RYAN WAS GIVEN SEVERAL OPIATES FOR PAIN RELIEF BUT THOSE WERE ENOUGH SO THE ADDED FENTANYL. ONE OF THE WORST DRUGS OPIOIDS AVAILABLE. THE RESULT WAS HE WAS ASLEEP MOST OF THE TIME. DURING ONE OF HIS RARE WAKING MOMENTS HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND THE LAST FEW WEEKS SLEEPING. WE SUGGESTED MEDICAL CANNABIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH AGREE. TO HE TOLD ME HE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH KATIE AND A SON CONNOR. IS PERRANCE BROTHER AND SISTER. AND MANY FRIENDS WHO ARE TEXTING CALLING AND VISITING HIM. WE HAD A MEDICAL CANNABIS CAMAS CREATE CAMPUS MEDICINES WHICH WOULD SLOW DOWN THE GROWTH OF THE CANCER. AND GIVE HIM MORE TIME. AND CANNABIS MEDICINES FOR PAIN RELIEF THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO BE AWAKE AND PAIN FREE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. BUT WERE BUT WE WERE INFORMED BY THE HOSPITAL THAT IT WAS THEIR POLICY NOT TO ALLOW CANNABIS IN THE HOSPITAL. THE IRONY THAT POLICY IS THAT THE AT THE PHÃ‹N N<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND OTHER&lt;/c&gt;</u> OPIATES TO KILL SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR IN THE U. S.. WE'RE OKAY TO HAVE IN THE HOSPITAL. BUT NOT MEDICAL CANNABIS HAS EVER KILLED ANYONE. AFTER SHORT FORTY EIGHT HOUR STAY AT HOME IT IS REQUEST YOU REALLY WANT TO BE HOME. WHICH IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT HI HE WAS. ADMITTED TO A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL THAT ALLOWED MEDICAL CANNABIS. THEY TOLD TO BRING IN THE MEDICINES THAT THEY WOULD REFRIGERATE THEM WITH HIS NAME ON THEM. IN ASSIST WITH ADMINISTERING THE DOSAGE. COMPLETE TURNAROUND FROM WHERE HE WAS ORIGINALLY. BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SWALLOW ANYTHING NOT EVEN WATER. THE CHEMISTRY THEY MEDICAL CAMPUS SUPPOSITORY SLOW THE GROWTH OF THE CANCER. AND TO MEDICAL CANNABIS SPRAYS. UNDER THE TONGUE. THEY WERE USED TO PROVIDE PAIN RELIEF. HE ALSO USED A MEDICAL CANNABIS PATCHES FOR ANXIETY RELIEF WHICH USE EXPERIENCING YOUR THE END. THE RESULT WAS AMAZING. AWAKE AND ALERT DURING THE DAY HE WAS ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH KATIE AND CONNOR. MY WIFE AND ME. THE BROTHER AND SISTER. ANOTHER FAMILY AND FRIENDS. ALL WITHOUT PAIN. NURSING STAFF AND DOCTORS WERE CRYING. INSTEAD OF SLEEPING ALL THE TIME FROM THE FENTANYL HE HAD A QUALITY OF LIFE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATIONS. WITH HIS FAMILY AND TIME TO REMINISCE AND LAUGH WITH HIS MANY FRIENDS WHO CAME TO VISIT. THANKS TO THE MEDICAL CANNABIS HE VALLEY HAD A QUALITY TIME WITH HIS LOVED ONES I THE FINAL DAYS AND HOURS OF HIS LIFE. VERY TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS RYAN. TO SPEND THE FINAL DAYS. WITH AS MUCH QUALITY IN DIGNITY AS POSSIBLE [inaudible] THEY'RE DYING. WHY WOULD WE WANT THAT FOR THEM? OPTIONS OTHER THAN SEVERE AND DEBILITATING OPIOIDS LIKE MORPHINE AND FENTANYL SHOULD BE ALLOWED. AND HEALTH CARE FACILITY SHOULD BE REQUIRED. TO ALLOW TO ALLOW THEM MIDDLE CAM IS A PROVEN EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE OPIOIDS. IF SOMEONE IS TERMINALLY ILL AND DYING IN HEALTH CARE FACILITY. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THEM WITH. ADDITIONAL OPTIONS ALMOND IS TO OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. TO ENHANCE AND MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE. RYAN SAID AN EXAMPLE FORCE. BRANCH LAW WILL ENABLE OTHER TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE. FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS AND DAYS WE HAVE MADE AS THE BILL WHICH WOULD. BETTER DEFINE THE SCOPE OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. PALLIATIVE CARE EXEMPTS HEALTH CARE FACILITIES CERTAIN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THEY CAN BE DISCUSSED AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO PLEASE VOTE TODAY TO KEEP SB THREE OH FIVE ALIVE AND MOVED FORWARD. ON BEHALF OF MILLIONS OF TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS WHO BENEFIT FROM IT [inaudible] RYAN'S LAW. IS HIS LEGACY. AND IS MY THERAPY. FOR EXPERIENCING WHEN NO PARENT SHOULD INDOOR. WATCHING A CHILD TAKE A LAST BREATH. THANK YOU -- THAT TEST MADE TO TAKE UP ALL OF THE TIME -- SO ASK YOU TO JUST VERY VERY BRIEFLY -- I'D I SHOULD EXPRESS YOUR SUPPORT. WELL DOCTOR GERMAN I'M DOCTOR DONALD LYMAN I'M HERE TO SPEAK AS AN INDIVIDUAL NOT A REPRESENTATIVE OF AND THE OUTSIDE AGENCY -- I WAS ONE OF THE CO PROPONENTS FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR AND HAVE BEEN PART OF THE EFFORT TO SET UP -- WHAT IS NOW A NEW A NEW CONTROL -- GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. WE DESIGNED PROP SIXTY FOUR TO BE A NEW INDUSTRY. BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN A PROPOSITION. EVEN A SIXTY FOUR PAGE PROPOSITION WILL NOT SET UP A NEW INDUSTRY. WE ARE NOW BUILDING POLICY ON TOP OF THAT STRUCTURE TO MAKE CONTROL OF CANNABIS WORK. THIS EFFORT TODAY IS ONE OF THE POLICY OPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE IN IN FLUSHING OUT THE NEW INDUSTRY. AND THE CONTROL STRUCTURE THAT IT REPRESENTS. SO I AM IN FAVOR OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I THINK IT IS AN APPROPRIATE ADDITION TO IT. AND I'D ASK YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN VERY BRIEFLY. I'M DOCTOR LORI BUT DARDEN RETIRED EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN. I THINK THERE'S TWO AMA COHEN OF ETHICS THAT ARE RELEVANTAND GERMANE. TO THIS ISSUE AND TO THIS BILL THE FIRST ONE SAYS IN GENERAL WITH A PHYSICIAN BELIEVE SO LAWS ON JOSH THEY SHOULD WORK TO CHANGE IT. IN EXCEPT IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF ON JUST LAWS ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD. SUPERSEDE LEGAL OBLIGATION I KNOW HOSPITALS ARE APPREHENSIVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO WITHDRAW THEIR BUT I THINK IT IS -- EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE A PATIENT IS DYING AND FINALLY THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A MORAL ACTIVITY THAT ARISES FROM THE IMPERATIVE OF POSITIONS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS AND ALLEVIATE THEIR SUFFERING WE NEED TO ALLEVIATE THEIR SUFFERING. THE PEOPLE ARE DYING BY ALLOWING THEM TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS THANK YOU THANK YOU -- SINCE I NOTE THE PRESENCE OF A QUORUM AMASS TAKE A PAUSE AND THAT SECRETIVE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

I CHAIR MEMBERS TEN THAT REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. TO SB THREE OH FIVE FOR EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR PATIENTS TO COME IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT ALREADY ON CERTAIN MEDICATIONS WE ARE PROCESSES IN PLACE WITHIN THE HOSPITAL TO MANAGE THOSE MEDICATIONS WE ACTUALLY TAKE THEM FROM THE PATIENT. WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO TREATING IN DIAGNOSING A MERCY CONDITION THOSE MEDICATIONS CAN CAUSE CHALLENGES FOR US GETTING TO A BETTER SENDING WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON WITH THE PATIENT AND WE VIEW? MEDICAL CANNABIS IS FALLING INTO THE SAME CATEGORY SO WE WE ARE OPPOSE BECAUSE WE THINK IT WOULD -- INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO TREAT OUR PATIENTS AND I TAKE WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT THE HOSPITALS MAY HAVE A CURRENTLY IN TERMS OF MANAGING THOSE MEDICATIONS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ALICE HAWTHORNE THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. AND ONLY BE REALLY CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT HERE TO OPPOSE THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS THE ISSUE MY MEMBERS HAVE IS TO PUT THE THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS EMPLOYEES FIRST AND TO MANAGE THE RISK FOR FOR EMPLOYEES. FOR THEIR PATIENTS -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILL CREATES RISKS -- BECAUSE OF FEDERAL CONFLICTS WE HAVE THOSE CONCERNS WE HAD REPRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR I'M WITH THE STAFF MEMBERS WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THIS RIGHT. AND DOING THE BEST THING FOR THE PATIENTS SO THIS TIME WE HAVE AN OPPOSE MUST AMENDED TO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. JENNIFER SNYDER BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES WAS REPRESENTS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WITH THE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF ALEX HAWTHORN WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR OUR PATIENTS WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. I'M IN WHEN IT CAN ALLEVIATE PAIN AND SUFFERING I THINK THE OVERALL CONCERN FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AS THEY ARE -- ALMOST A 100% GOVERNMENT FUNDED SO MEDICAID AND MEDICARE FUNDING IS IS AN IMPORTANT -- ASPECT OF WHETHER OR NOT THE FACILITY STAYS OPEN OR IT DOESN'T -- SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT CAN BE MITIGATED -- WAS VERY -- PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S PROTECTED IN CASES WHERE IT MIGHT. COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT THANK YOU. PETER CALLOUS NON BEHALF OF LEADING AIDS CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS NOT FOR PROFIT SKILLED NURSING PROVIDERS SIMILAR COMMENTS -- SIMILAR CONCERNS AS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED AND LOOK FOR THE WORKING WITH-THE AUTHOR. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SEEN NO AT THE MICROPHONE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MISTER BARTEL IT'S WAS VERY NICE TO MEET YOU YESTERDAY I'M SORRY MADE INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE DID -- BUT I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND CHAMPIONING THIS ISSUE -- WITH THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO MY FRIEND SENATOR HUESO -- APPRECIATE SAYING THEY THE IMAGE OF YOUR SON HERE TODAY TO AND I DID READ THE LETTER FROM -- YOUR YOUR WIFE. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HERE I TALKED ABOUT IT OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS IS THE FOR THE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY HYPOCRITICAL YOU KNOW ON ONE ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION YOU GOT THE D. E. A. THIS AS ATTACK ANY CALIFORNIANS ARE -- OF NO BUT THIS IS A VALUE AND THEY CAN BE ABUSED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN YOU GOT THE FTA THIS IS AT THAT. CERTAIN DERIVATIVES MARINOL INSTITUTE AN EXAMPLE NOW CBT ARE ARE FDA APPROVED SO ON ONE SIDE OF THE CREATION SAYS THAT THEY'RE NOT USEFUL OR OR DUE TO THE OTHER SIDE IT SAYS THAT THEY THEY DO HAVE THERAPEUTIC VALUE WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT MERRILL'S MENUS FOR WASTING AND AIDS PATIENTS. AND PATIENTS WITH -- CAM THERAPY AND NOW CBT FOR CERTAIN THE PEDIATRIC A SEIZURE DISORDERS. SO -- ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT -- WE'VE IT WILL ENACTED SOME VERY. GOOD LEGISLATION TO HEAR I SHALL TRY YOU KNOW FOR THINGS AND NOTEVEN FTA PROVED. TO TO GIVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DYING SOME HOPE. AND IN SOME CASES QUALITY OF LIFE AND THIS IS REALLY A QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUE -- WE KNOW THAT PHÃ‹N N<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;WHICH IS -- A&lt;/c&gt;</u> VERY POTENT OPIATE -- MY HUNDRED TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE AND MISTER BARTEL IN IS -- LATE SOMBER CONCERNED THAT HE BE SLEEPING ALL THE WAY THROUGH -- HIS DEMISE IN THE HEALTH THAT. HE WANTED TO BE AWAKENED HIS FINAL HOURS AND WAS ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM FROM CANNABIS TO ALLEVIATE HIS PAIN AND TO ALLOW HIM TO HAVE -- CONSCIOUS -- RELATIONS WITH IS IS. WITH HIS FAMILY IN IN AND THOSE FINAL HOURS. AND I THINK THAT. IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE OF OF CANNABIS -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T STUDY TOO MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW -- ILLEGAL FOR SO MANY YEARS AND WOULD READ BY THINK SENATOR HUESO MENTION THIRTY THREE STATES NOW I EMBRACE THE MEDICINAL MARIJUANA. AND AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF STUDY THAT WOULD BEEN DONE A LOT IN ISRAEL THAT SHOW THAT THERE IS MEDICAL EFFICACY FOR IT. SO WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS THAT. NEED TO BE GIVEN A CHOICE -- IF CANNABIS HELP SOME AND ALLEVIATES ARE SUFFERING -- THEN WE SHOULD GIVE IT -- I DO UNDERSTAND -- THAT YOU KNOW PHYSICIANS TO HAVE A THE A LICENSE. THEY NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- HOSPITAL'S SURGERY CENTERS THAT TAKE MEDICAID ALL MEDICARE -- THAT HAVE SOME FEDERAL COMPONENT. I THINK THE CHURCH CONCERNS ARE ARE JUST I THINK THAT. THE SENATOR HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THROUGH -- SOME AMENDMENTS SAID IF THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME -- RATTLING BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME AVENUES -- TO TO BACKTRACK IF IT IS IF CERTAIN NECESSARY BUT I DON'T FORESEE. THAT HAPPENING I THINK THAT THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALBEIT -- MAYBE THE THE PRESIDENT IS NOT THE MOST POPULAR PERSON IN THIS BUILDING THESE DAYS BUT I WILL SAY THIS THAT I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE IS A VERY COMPASSIONATE -- GROUP ESPECIALLY AT THE AT THE FDA -- I THINK PHYSICIANS -- ONE OF ALLEVIATE SUFFERING AS A ONE OF THE PHYSICIANS HAD HAD MENTIONED. AND YOU KNOW IF IF IF CANNABIS IS IS IS THE BETTER CATION THAT -- ALLOWS. ONE TO BETTER -- COPE WITH THEIR THEIR PAIN AND THEIR SUFFERING IN THEIR FINAL HOURS AND WE SHOULD BE STANDING BEHIND THEM AND LEVY THAT SUFFERING SO -- GOT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK OF MISTER BARTEL FOR FOR MAKING THIS IS PASSION -- SIR NOBODY SHOULD -- INDOOR THE NIGHTMARE THAT YOU HAD TO INDOOR WAS SUCH SHORT NOTICE YOUR SON. COMING DOWN AFTER GOING TO EMERGENCY ROOM WITH THEM. WHAT OF WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A SIMPLE ELEMENT INTRODUCTORY SUCH A SERIOUS ELEMENT -- THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS TRY TO EASE HIS SUFFERING AND THROUGH YOUR WORK AND YOUR BEING HERE TODAY YOU'RE GONNA BE FURTHERING THE MEMORY OF YOUR SON. SO THAT OTHERS DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER AND GOD BLESS YOU FOR DOING THAT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN I I DID READ TO THE LETTER THAT YOUR WIFE ROAD AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE MISTER BARTEL IN TELLING THE STORY OF YOUR SENSIBLE ECHO THOSE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATOR STONE -- JUST COMMENTED ON I DO SYMPATHIZE -- VERY MUCH THAT -- THE SITUATION THAT YOU FOUND YOURSELF IN AND THAT YOU KNOW I FOUND MYSELF AND MY MOM NEVER CHOOSING SHE DIDN'T USE MEDICAL CANNABIS BUT I GET YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THE LAST FEW WEEKS SHE WANTED CERTAIN THINGS AND THE DOCTORS ARE LIKE NO AND I'M LIKE CLICK YOU KNOW JUST GIVE HER WHAT SHE NEEDS OR WHAT SHE WANTS. SO -- I GET IT AND I DO SYMPATHIZE VERY MUCH BUT I AM VERY EMPATHETIC WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND BECAUSE AS A BUSINESS CENTER WE DO FIND YOURSELF IN CONFLICT WITH CALIFORNIA LAW AND FEDERAL LAW -- CONSTANTLY REDEFINE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS -- FOR BEING CALIFORNIA LAW BUT OPPOSING FEDERAL LAW OR YOU'RE FINED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FIRST YOU KNOW SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA LINE OPPOSING FEDERAL LAW OR VICE VERSA. SO -- I A I A I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK DOCTOR IF HE IS GOING TO ON I KNOW YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS IS THEM CAN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ACCEPT THE MINUTES TO PROTECT. LIKE THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT DO YOU HAVE. YOU KNOW ALMOST A 100% OF THEIR FUNDING COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IF THEY COME IN. AND THEY SHOULD HIM DOWN BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH CALIFORNIA ON YOUR BILL THERE'S SOME TYPE OF REMEDY THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE. UP AT FOUR THING CAN I HAVE YOUR WORD ON THAT BECAUSE I REALLY DO WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT I CAN'T DO IT NOT KNOWING THAT AND IT PUTS THEM IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING THEIR ENTIRE FACILITY AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE SERVICES IN THE THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE TO SKILLED NURSING. WHERE A LOT OF OUR ELDERLY ARE AT AND -- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF AS WELL ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S BEEN OUR INTENT FROM THE BEGINNING AND LIKE I SAID THE LIVE THE THE THE DETAILS OF THE LAWS ALWAYS. THE LANGUAGE I MEAN IT'S ALWAYS VERY -- TECHNICAL SO WE'LL WANT ONE MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE LANGUAGE CONFORMS TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND THAT'S THAT AND OF COURSE SO WHY WOULD WE ENACT A BILL THAT IS COUNTRY -- THAT WILL ONLY PUT PEOPLE IN OUR STATE IN JEOPARDY. BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE YOUR A FOR A YET ANOTHER YEAR -- IN EVERY YEAR THE THE LEGISLATURE -- IN IN THE FEDERAL [inaudible] GOVERNMENT. UNDER THE A BOMB IN AN ADMINISTRATION UNDER UNDER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THEY'VE COME OUT AND THEY BASICALLY SAID WE'RE NOT ENFORCING ANY RULES -- REGARDING -- MEDICAL MARIJUANA REMEMBER WATCHING THE STATE'S LAWS ON ON MARIJUANA USE. AND WE HAVE A COPY OF THIS YEAR'S AGAIN THAT SPECIFICALLY LISTS CALIFORNIA. AS ONE OF THE STATES IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT APPLY A SINGLE PENNY. OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS. THAT -- PREVENT -- THE STATE'S FROM IMPLEMENTING THEIR OWN STATE LAWS ARE AUTHORIZED TO USE DISTRIBUTION POSITION POSSESSION. OR CULTIVATION OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA SO WE HAVE KIND OF IT'S LIKE A A PROMISE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE STATE'S YOU DO WHICH ONES BUT SHOULD SHOULD THAT CHANGE. IT IT IT EXPOSES ALL OUR LAWS. AND AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR LAWS WOULD PRETTY MUCH BE BE PUT IN JEOPARDY AND JUST LIKE. THE WAY WE HAVE LEGISLATED ON THOSE LAWS -- WE WILL WE WILL DO THE SAME FOR THIS BILL NOTHING DIFFERENT NOTHING UNIQUE -- SAME WAY. BUT IT IT IT JUST IN MY OPINION AND WHATEVER MY OPINIONS WORTH IN THE OPINION OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN IN THIS INDUSTRY RIGHT PROBABLY SHARE WE SHARE MY OPINION. THAT THERE IS A TREND TO TOWARD THE OPPOSITE MORE -- EVIDENCES SHOW WE NEED THAT MARIJUANA HAS BENEFICIAL USES AND AND DOESN'T THAN IT DOES NOT HAVE DETRIMENTAL USES. AND AND MORE STATES ARE ADOPTING LAWS I MEAN CALIFORNIA WAS FIRST THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW WE HAVE THIRTY THREE STATES. NOW WE HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO FORCE LAWS. AND TO THAT AFFECT I THINK WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT SHOULD ANYTHING CHANGE OF MY WORDS OF THE THE PRINT WILL BE THERE. AND AND I WILL I WOULD NOT SEND A BILL TO THE GOVERNOR THAT IS NOT ON SOLID FOOTING. I DON'T AND I DON'T DOUBT THAT I DON'T DOUBT THAT -- THAT THE LETTER THAT YOU HAVE IS VALID I DON'T DOUBT THAT AND THE ADMINISTRATION IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ENFORCE IT. IT DOESN'T MEAN THE ADMINISTRATION CHANGES EVERY FOUR YEARS OR EVERY YEARS. AND SO AGAIN -- JUST THE QUESTION I I THINK IT'S VERY BENEFICIAL I THINK THAT -- THESE CANNABIS ESPECIALLY IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION ARE ONLY REALLY IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION -- I THINK IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE PATIENT AND SO LIKE I SAID I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC AND I DO WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I NEED TO MAKE SURE. AND HAVE YOUR WORD THAT THAT LANGUAGE WILL BE INSERTED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THESE FACILITIES THAT GET FEDERAL FUNDING SO IF SOMETHING DOES CHANGE. WE DON'T HAVE A THREE HUNDRED BED FACILITY OF SKILLED NURSING INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED END OF LIFE CARE. AT THAT ARE ON THE STREETS OR WHATEVER I MEAN I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LAW THAT CONTRADICTS OF FEDERAL LAW THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO YOU AND I BOTH WANT TO MAKE SURE. GREAT THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU AND MAY BE OUT TO SISTER AGAIN I CENTER HUESO PERSONAL THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT. TO THIS ISSUE I THINK JUST. IN TERMS OF SIR GROW FIVE AND JUST WEST EIGHT PUBLICLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS ESSENTIALLY LANGUAGE IT SAYS. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- PASSES ARE ARE EXPRESS -- PASSES BUT TOPS -- EXPLICIT REGULATION THAT FOR BIDS THIS ORDER TAKES ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST CALIFORNIA FACILITY. THE AND WHICH CASE -- IN THOSE EITHER ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS VAN -- THE THIS THIS BILL OF THAT IT BECOMES A LAW WITH THE BUT NOT THEN BE -- SOMETHING THAT COULD TAKE PLACE RIGHT AND AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT TECHNICALLY THIS. LAW WOULD NOT TRULY BE ENFORCEABLE WE WOULDN'T DO THE STATE'S WE COULDN'T REALLY DO A STATE SANCTIONED ANYWAY GIVEN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES -- BUT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAD THAT MADE THE COMMITMENT. TO TO TO WORK ON ON THAT PARTICULAR LANGUAGE CORRECT. DATA SO HOPEFULLY THAT -- ADDRESSES -- AND I AM NOW A MAYBE ALSO SAY AND APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT THAT CERTAINLY IS THE CHAIR. OF GIVEN YOUR COMMITMENT THAT WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF MY CONCERNS THAT IF IT'S NOT THERE WE MAY PULL IT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL. AND BUT I I I KNOW YOUR MANAGER WORD I DON'T EXPECT THERE'S AND YEAH I DON'T EXPECT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO MAYBE IF THAT GIVES SOME COMFORT TO CENTER GROVE YOU'VE GOT -- AND IN TERMS OF THAT ISSUE SO BY INTO BITE KNOW YOUR MANUAL WORD AND THAT APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO THAT. AND OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY AND THEN JUST ONE OTHER TO THAT POINT YEAH I'D APPRECIATE THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM BIRDS FROM PHYSICIANS -- I THINK -- HOPEFULLY THERE SOME CONVERSATIONS YOU ALSO HAVE WITH THEM ABOUT THESE PRIME MORE ROUND -- BEING SURE THAT THE PHYSICIANS THAT SOMEONE'S USING SOMETHING IN A FACILITY DECISIONS NEED TO KNOW THAT IT'S THERE BUT THEY'RE USING AND AND AND HAVE SOME SORT OF SAY IN TERMS OF HOW IT INTERACTS WITH THEIR OTHER TREATMENT RATE WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO BAND CANNABIS. IN THE FACILITY WERE LOOKING TO BE SURE THAT IT'S NOT INTERFERING OR THAT THE CERTAINLY THE POSITION NO SO THAT WHEN THEY'RE CRAFTING THEIR TREATMENTS THAT THERE ISN'T SOME. INTERFERENCE OUR OUR SITE A FACTOR -- ADVERSE EVENT ATTRACTED ME HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THAT A KNOWINGLY SELL YES OKAY SAW FIGURE YOU CAN WORK THAT OUT OKAY. WITH THAT. THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS -- THEM THIS BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SIR STONE'S THERE HUESO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THE SIMPLY THANK YOU. FOR THIS THIS DISCUSSIONS -- AND THIS -- ABILITY TO WORK WITH ME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED SPEND SECOND ADVICE -- CENTER STONE SURGERY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AN HI HI STONE. STONE AYE DORADO DRAWS -- I GROW. GROVE I HER TADO. LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL MONNING RUBIO. THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET IT OUT TO HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THINKS MIGHT CENTER HUESO. SENATOR HILL I SEE THERE OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB THREE TWENTY FIVE BY CENTER HELLO WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON AND COLLEAGUES. I LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS IN COMMENTS NINE AND TEN AND WE WILL BE PASSING AROUND A MOCK OF THAT OF THOSE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL. IN IT AND THE MEMBERS ENSURE THAT ALL LICENSE PROGRAMS MEET THE SAME HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL WAS PROPOSED FOR CONSENT AND THEN WE RECEIVE SOME LATE OPPOSITION -- I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO COME TO SOME SOME CONSENSUS ON THE BILL AND I THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- SUBSTANCE ABUSE COSTS OUR NATION OVER FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. BUT EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT HELPED REDUCE THESE COSTS TREATMENT IS ALSO LESS IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN COMMON ALTERNATIVE OUTCOME SUCH AS INCARCERATING ADDICTED PERSONS. CURRENTLY RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A LICENSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. LAST YEAR I AUTHORED SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE WHICH FURTHER REQUIRED RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS TO UTILIZE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT STANDARDS. OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS HOWEVER DO NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRE ANY LICENSING ORDER THEY NEED TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT. THE H. C. S. OFFERS ASSERTIVE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM BUT IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY. TODAY IF YOU WANTED OPEN YOUR OWN OUTPATIENT TREATMENT FACILITY YOU COULD DO SO IMMEDIATELY NO LICENSE TRAINING OR PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. SB THREE TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMS TO BE LICENSED WITH DH CS IT ALSO REQUIRES RELATIONS PROVIDERS TO KEEP RECORDS OF ADMISSIONS WITHDRAWALS TRANSFERS AND DISCHARGES. AND THE REASON FOR EACH ADDITIONALLY THIS MEASURE WOULD PROHIBIT LICENSED PROVIDERS FROM ENGAGING IN PATIENTS SELLING AND RECRUITING FOR MONETARY GAIN. THOSE SEEKING TREATMENT NEED TO KNOW THAT ANY PROVIDER THEY SELECT MEETS AN EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT STANDARD. IN THAT THOSE STANDARDS ARE BEING ENFORCED BY THE STATE. I HAVE WITNESSED MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER HELL WITNESSES REPORT.

THE BILL ALSO DEFINES YOUTH SUBSTANCE -- TREATMENT DISORDER -- SERVICES TO INCLUDE ANY PUBLICLY FUNDED DIRECT SERVICE INTENDED TO ADDRESS OR TREAT S. U. D. IS FOR INDIVIDUALS. FROM BIRTH TO TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA HAS MADE NMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX NOT OF ISSUES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND YET OUR SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS DON'T SEEM TO CARRY OUT OUR INTENTIONS. WE SEE THE RESULTS AROUND US ON THE STREETS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTM. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT ADOLESCENTS ARE MORE VULNERABLE THAN ADULTS TO ALCOHOL CANNABIS. TOBACCO AND OTHER DRUG RELATED PROBLEMS I SOMEONE SAID THAT SAID A TEENAGER COULD END UP WITH -- ALCOHOL PROBLEM IN THREE TO SIX MONTHS -- AND OFF OFTEN TOO MANY DO SERVICES FOR YOUTH NEED TO BE INTEGRATED HEN WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE NECESSARY TO SERVE THE YOUTH MOST IN NEED. WHEREVER THEY ARE IN A COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S ON THE STREET IN A HOMELESS SHELTER IN FOSTER CARE GROUP HOMES ARE IN SCHOOLS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A YOUTH TREATMENT STANDARD FOR CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS BY SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THEIR NEEDS.

OF TWO BILLS BEFORE US SO WHY SOME YOU TAKE THEM UP ENOUGH I'LL ORDER NUMBER ORDERS OKAY SO WE'RE GONG TO DO FIRST WHEN I DO OF ITEM NUMBER THREE SB -- TWO TWO SEVEN BUT CERTAINLY VOTE WELCOME. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. MEMBERS AS MANY OF YOU MAY REMEMBER SEVERAL OF YOU SAW A VERY SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR MY SB. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT AFTER PASSING BOTH HOUSES FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATING LEGISLATION SAYING THE HOSPITALS ARE BEST EVALUATED. IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER NEEDLESS TO SAY I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTLESS PATIENTS WHO SEE KAREN HOSPITALS THE NURSES WHO WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SB TWO TWO SEVEN EMPOWERS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CV PH TO ENSURE PUBLIC SEES ME TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY BY ENFORCING NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. AND FINING HOSPITALS THAT REPEATEDLY BREAK THESE STANDARDS. DESPITE MANDATED AND LONGSTANDING NURSE PATIENT RATIOS SOME HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO VIOLATE THESE VITAL REQUIREMENTS. FROM 200-082-2000 SEVENTEEN THERE WERE A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR ALLEGATIONS REPORTED TO CD PH IN REGARDS TO OUT OF RATIO DEFICIENCIES. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT'S CURRENT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS SURVEYS EVERY THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THE HOSPITALS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. HOWEVER THIS PERIODIC CHECK IS FAR TOO INFREQUENT ALLOWS HOSPITALS TO PREPARE BEFORE CITY PH CAM FOR CAN DUCKS THEIR SURVEY. SB TWO TWO SEVEN WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT'S CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO HOSPITALS TO INSPECT FOR COMPLIANCE WITH NURSE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO EMPOWER THE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS WITH FINES WERE STAFFING RATIOS HAVE BEEN BY LA. SB TWO TWO SEVEN IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA HERE IN SUPPORT TODAY IS GAIL BATISTE PRESIDENT OF SEIU LOCAL ONE TWO ONE ARE AND MARK WINDOWS -- WITH SCA YOU AND SO IN YOUR ROBERTSON WITH YOU NECK. OKAY THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT SIX MINUTES TOTAL OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS GILBERTESE. I'M THE PRESIDENT OF SCE I YOU WANT TO ONE ARE AND THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS REGISTERED NURSES THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I AM ALSO AN OPERATING ROOM NURSE AT DIGNITY NORTHRIDGE HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER AND I BECAME A NURSE THIRTY SIX YEARS AGO BECAUSE I WANTED -- TO CARE FOR THE SICK AND THE RUNNABLE. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK THREE AYE VOTE ON SB. TWO TWO SEVEN CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION WITH NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. THESE RATIOS ARE INTENDED TO KEEP OUR PATIENTS SAFE AND PRODUCE THE MOST OPTIMAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. HOWEVER THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM FOR TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS NEED TO BE FIXED AND STRENGTHENS. CURRENTLY THE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING THE LAW ARE NEARLY NONEXISTENT. IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN THE HOSPITAL'S FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS CITY PH GIVES THEM CITATIONS KNOWN AS PLANS OF CORRECTION. SURPRISINGLY THERE IS NO LIMIT ON HOW MANY PLANS OF CORRECTION A HOSPITAL CAN GET AND MOST IF NOT ALL HOSPITALS ARE NEVER FIND. THIS IS WHY HOSPITALS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUOUSLY BREAK THE LAW AND PUT PATIENT SAFETY AT RISK. AS A NURSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT VALUE TO COMPLY WITH NURSE STAFFING RATIOS BUT PATIENTS AT REST. THE NURSES HERE TODAY THAT WILL SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE WILL ALSO TESTER IMPORTANCE OF NURSE STAFFING RATIOS AND HOW THEY PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE IS MENTIONED IN OUR EARLIER PRESS CONFERENCE KATHY A RIVERSIDE ARE AND DISCUSSED HOW A PATIENT DEVELOPS THEORY SECONDARY ILLNESSES. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF DANGEROUSLY. LOW STAFFING LEVELS. IMAGINE IF THAT PATIENT WAS YOUR MOTHER YOUR FATHER. WIFE HUSBAND SHALL OR YOURSELF. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS BETTER AND ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE. SB TWO TWO SEVEN WOULD CREATE A GREATER DISINCENTIVE BY INSTITUTING REPEAT OFFENDER LANGUAGE. HOSPITALS THAT WILL FULLY AND CONSISTENTLY VIOLATE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS WILL NOW FACE FINES DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN THEY VIOLATE TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS. WHAT GOOD IS A REGULATIONS IF THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM? ALLOW CD PH INVESTIGATORS TO CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED VISITS. SO THAT THESE REPEAT OFFENDERS WON'T BE ABLE TO SKIRT THE LAW BEFORE THE STATE CAN INVESTIGATE VIOLATIONS. THIS MEASURE IS COSPONSORED BY SEIU ONE TO ONE ARE AN S. C. R. U. NURSE ALLIANCE A NEW MAC. AS NURSES WE TOOK AN OLD TO PROTECT AN ADVOCATE FOR OUR PATIENTS SB TWO TWO SEVEN A SOUND POLICY THAT ALIGNS WITH OUR FULL. ON BEHALF OF ALL THE NURSES OF SCA YOU WANT TO ON OUR END. AS RAW CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO PASS SB TWO TWO SEVEN TO PROTECT PATIENTS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MENDOZA WITH US HERE YOU CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S GONE TOO LONG WITHOUT A STRONG ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CITY PH IMPLEMENTED REGULATIONS ON ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR A BROAD RANGE OF I. OBLATIONS. AMONG THEM BEING VIOLATIONS OF NURSE STAFFING RATIOS. WHILE THESE REGULATIONS WERE INTENDED TO INCENTIVIZE HOSPITALS TO COMPLY WITH THE RATIOS THE REGULATIONS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. NOTABLY SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THE REGULATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF HEART HOSPITALS VIOLATING THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. WHEN CITY PEACH DISCOVERS A VIOLATION OF THE NURSE STAFFING RATIOS THEY ADMINISTER A PLAN OF CORRECTION CITATION THAT CARRIES NO MONETARY OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY ATTACHED TO IT? SB TWO TWO SEVEN NARROWLY FINDS HOSPITALS THAT REPEATEDLY AND WILLFULLY VIOLATE THE RATIOS. THE MEASURE GIVE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION TO SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS AND ALLOWS YOU TO PEACH TO IMPLEMENT THIS MEASURE WITHOUT REGULATIONS IF PASSED INTO LAW. MOREOVER THE MEASURE REWARDS HOSPITALS THAT COMPLY WITH THESE RATIOS DESPITE HAVING VIOLATIONS IN THE PAST. THE CONCEPT OF NURSE STAFFING RATIOS HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER FOUR DECADES AND HAS ALLOWED HOSPITALS AMPLE TIME TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE NURSE STAFFING RATIOS. WHEN THE NURSE DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO TURN A PATIENT IN WHEN A NURSE CANNOT GIVE MEDICATION IN A TIMELY MANNER THE PATIENT CAN DEVELOP AN INFECTION OR SUFFER FROM EXCRUCIATING PAIN? AND ABOVE ALL WHEN THE NURSES RUNNING AMONG VARIOUS DIFFERENT ROOMS AND APARTMENTS THE NURSE ME NOT NOTICE THE SUBTLE CHANGE IN THE PATIENT'S CONDITION THAT COULD LEAD TO THEIR DEATH. I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB TWO TWO SEVEN TO NOT ONLY PROTECT OUR NURSES BUT ULTIMATELY TO ENSURE THAT HOSPITALS ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PRIORITIZE A PATIENT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY THANK YOU. HI GOOD DAY AND THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HERE I'D LIKE TO TANK. GERMAN PAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- MAMA HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO TWO SEVEN AT ALSO LIKE TO THANK ON SENATOR CONNIE LEIVA WHOSE ALTERING THE BILL FOR US.

I'M A REGISTERED NURSE I WORK ON MAKE SEARCH TELL THE AND I'VE BEEN WORKING AS A REGISTERED NURSE FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. ALL WE KNOW THAT IT'S ALMOST THE SAME EQUIVALENT TIME FROM SINCE THE BILL WITH PATH WHERE WE SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE TO REACH IT TO PROTECT THE PATIENTS FOR THEIR SAFETY. HOWEVER OVER THE LAST EIGHT TO TEN YEARS -- THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY CHANGES WITHIN THE HOSPITALS AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN REINFORCING THE BILL AT ALL. DIFFERENT WE ENDED UP WITH A LOT OF PATIENT FALLS WE ENDED UP WITH PATIENTS DYING WE ENDED UP WITH A PATIENT LIKE THAT ARE NOT BEING ANSWERED I MYSELF PERSONALLY -- ENDED UP HAVING SOME PROBLEMS THAT WERE MADE WORSE BECAUSE THE NURSE TOLD ME -- TALKED AT MINISTRATION SHOULD OUT TRYING TO SEE ME AND I ENDED UP WITH MY LEVELS DUBLIN AND ENDED UP SIX STATES IN THE HOSPITAL INSTEAD OF FOUR SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE HAVING BECAUSE OF STOPPING ISSUES -- I WANT THE BEST EXPERIENCE IN THE BEST OUTCOME FOR THE PATIENT -- SB TWO TWENTY SEVEN WILL DELIVERS FIFTY CAN CARE BY FINISHED FINING HOSPITALS WHO HABITUALLY CUT CORNERS AND ENCOURAGE THEM -- TO STOP APPROPRIATELY SO ON BEHALF OF ALL THE NURSES THE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS.

TING ON US AT THE MICROPHONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ACTUALLY WE CAN MAKE ROOM FOR THEM AT THE TABLE. JUST MAKING TO SERVE. YOU CAN MOVE AROUND CIDER. I'M SO SORRY. THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- DEBBIE ROGERS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. THERE'S NO RESPONSIBILITY GREATER FOR A HOSPITAL THE TO CARE FOR THE PATIENTS THAT ARRIVE IN OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT EVERY DAY THAT ARE CARED FOR IN OUR HOSPITALS. AS YOU ALL KNOW CON HOSPITALS ARE COMPLICATED ENVIRONMENTS WE WE ASKED OUR HOSPITALS -- YOU KNOW AN AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED BED HOSPITAL HAS ELEVEN OR SO NURSING UNITS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY REGISTERED NURSES -- AND THAT'S EVERY SINGLE DAY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR. SO AT ANY WITH THIS BILL THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS BILL REALLY IS A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS AT ALL TIMES EVERY MINUTE EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THOSE HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES. DRIVING THE FREEWAYS TO GET TO WORK IF THERE'S A CAR ACCIDENT. OR A SICK CHILD THAT NEEDS TO BE DROPPED OFF AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE INSTEAD OF SCHOOL AND THAT NURSE IS FIVE MINUTES LATE. THAT'S A PENALTY UNDER THIS BILL. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW JUST HOW COMPLICATED -- THESE THINGS ARE -- ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS A REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS FOR HOSPITALS TO BE FIND -- UNDER A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND I WANT TO COMPLIMENT -- COMMITTEE STAFF OF FOR THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND REALLY THE EXISTING REGULATIONS ALLOW A FINE FOR EVERYTHING FROM AN IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY AND THE DEATH OF THE PATIENT -- TO SOMETHING WHERE THERE'S NO ACTUAL HARM TO THE PIT TAKE TO THE PATIENT BUT POTENTIAL FOR MORE THAN MINIMAL HARM. SO THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN CURRENTLY FIND A HOSPITAL FOR BUT IT'S BASED ON MANY FACTORS THAT THE LEGISLATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT INTO. THE ENACTING BILL THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO LOOK AT IN ORDER TO CREATE THAT FINE AND SO IT TAKES IN IT REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO TAKE INTO THE TOTALITY OF ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AROUND THE EVENT THAT HAPPENED RATHER THAN A NURSE HAVING TO STEP AWAY FROM PATIENT CARE FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL -- HAS CALLED WITH A PROBLEM. SO WE THINK THAT THE STRICT LIABILITY STANDARDS THAT APPEARS IN THE BILL TODAY -- WILL INCREASE FINES INCREDIBLY -- FLU SEASON AND FOR NURSES CALL IN SICK AND THE HOSPITALS ARE SCRAMBLING TO CALL IN OTHERS ASKING OTHER NURSES TO STAY LATER -- WILL JUST INCREASE THE FINES AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU. CALDERON OUT OSMOSIS STATION HERE FOR QUESTIONS ALSO WANTED TO ADD THAT THE SPONSORS HAVE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT THEY ARE THIS IS FOCUSED ON THE HAVE VISUAL OFFENDERS -- ARE DIFFICULTY IS FOR FIRST AND FOREMOST S THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE US AS THE PREVIOUS WITNESS AS TO BE -- TO HAVE NURSES AT ALL TIMES AND THERE ARE MANY SITUATIONS -- WHERE NURSES STEP OFF THE FLOOR FOR A MYRIAD OF REASONS -- AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET A NURSE THERE ON TIME OR A PATIENTS ACUITY CHANGES AND IT COULD BE TEN MINUTES BEFORE WE CAN GET A NURSE THERE. WE NURSES. AND AND WE WE APPRECIATE ALL OF THOSE IN THE ROOM WORK HARD TO BALANCE THAT DURING THAT SHIFT BUT AT THAT TIME. WE WOULD BE FINE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS DEPENDING ON WHERE WE ARE AND SO FOR US. COMBINED WITH THE FIND IN THE OUT ALL TIMES THIS BILL IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR TO ASK FOR OPPOSITION. OTHER. OPPONENTS SUPPOSED AGAIN NAME ORGANIZATION AND I CIVIC JOURNAL I NOW GOT DECISION. JONATHAN CLAIM TO HAVE A SCRIPT HEALTH IN OPPOSITION. CONNIE DELGADO ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORUM IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. KAREN SARKISIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND OPPOSITION THANK YOU. IN WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS IN OPPOSITION. THE SUCH SHORT ON BEHALF OF STANFORD HEALTH CARE ON THE LINES OF CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MICHAEL HAWKINS REPRESENTATIVE HEALTH CARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. OKAY SEE NO ONE ELSE OF MICROPHONE A QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A CENTER STONE. THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR AND NOW I WANT TO THANK -- ALL THE NURSES THAT ARE HERE TODAY TO I I REALLY RESPECT THE WORK THAT YOU DO. AND KEEPING OUR OUR CITIZENS HEALTHY IN HOSPITAL WORKING UNDER SOME VERY. STRESSFUL CIRCUMSTANCES -- CENTER LEYVA -- LET ME SAY THAT. ANY HOSPITAL THAT IS ENGAGED IN THE PURPOSE FOR INSUBORDINATION OF THE LAW WITH RESPECT. TO THE USE RATIOS. I THINK SHOULD BE IN FACT FIND -- BUT I'M CONSERVE I'M CONCERNED THAT -- THE OPPOSITION IS MADE SOME VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENTS SUCH AS ANDERS COMES IN LATE I MEAN -- I SEE CEDAR SINAI HOSPITAL WELL A VERY BRIEF. LARGE RESPECTABLE INSTITUTION. TRAFFIC IN LA IS RIDICULOUS MY DAUGHTER LIVES THERE TAKES ME HOURS TO GET IN TO SEE HER -- STONE IMPOSSIBLE OF ONE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT THAT SOMEBODY CAN GET LIVE THERE LATE -- YOU ALSO WHAT BY VIRTUE OF THE JOB THE NURSES DO THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE THAT ARE SICK IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THAT THEY CAN BECOME SICK WHILE THEY'RE WORKING AND THEY GOT TO GO HOME. OR IF THERE'S A FAMILY EMERGENCY -- A NURSE MAIN AT MAY HAVE TO GO HOME AND TAKE CARE FOR A CHILD OR CARE FOR A LOVED. ONE AND SO. WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THE LAW IS VERY RIGID IT'S VERY STRICT BUT ARE WE GOING TO BE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW SO IF YOU NEED THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. HAPPEN AND THEY ARE. GOING TO LET'S SAY A SERVICE TO GET A AN EMERGENCY NURSE TO COME IN AND BACK FILL OR THE CALLING ON THEIR ARMAMENT TARIAN OF NURSES THAT ARE NORMALLY ON THEIR STAFF TO BRING A MAN. MAYBE IN OVERTIME -- IS THERE ANY AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN OR ARE CONSIDERING TAKING THAT IS GOING TO KEEP THE GOOD PLAYERS IF YOU WILL. FROM GETTING THESE EXTRAVAGANT FINDS THIRTY AND SIXTY THOUSAND AND A FOR PURPOSELY EVADING THE LAW AND PUTTING PATIENTS IN JEOPARDY YOU SHOULD BE FINE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THOSE THOSE HOSPITALS THAT THROUGH. POLICIES THAT THEY DON'T 1100% CONTROL ALL THE TIME BE FALL DEFICIENT FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THEY CAN SATISFY THE LAW. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION SO AS STATED IN TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS SEE SEE OUR SECTION SEVEN ZERO TWO ONE OUR WHEN A HEALTHCARE EMERGENCY OCCURS THE HOSPITAL MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT PROMPT EFFORTS. WERE MADE TO MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED STAFFING LEVELS SO I THINK THAT SHOULD ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS I WOULD ALSO SAY WE HEARD THE OPPOSITION SAY AT ALL TIMES THAT HAS BEEN IN STATUTE FOR TWENTY YEARS SO THAT IS NOT NEW. AND HOSPITALS ARE UNDER -- THEY DON'T HAVE AN INVESTIGATION DONE EVERY DAY EVERY WEEK IT'S EVERY THREE YEARS SO YOU SOMEONE MIGHT COME IN LATE AND THEY WON'T BE RE INVESTIGATED THAT EXCUSE ME THERE THERE WON'T BE ANY KIND OF A STUDY THAT DAY SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT REALLY. THE STATUTE UNDER TITLE TWENTY TWO I THINK PROTECTS WHAT YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT I KNOW THE ROUTINE INSPECTIONS EVERY THREE YEARS BUT CERTAINLY THE COMPLAINT BASE TO SO -- YOU KNOW A LOT OF OF THE NURSES -- ARE PART OF A LARGE LABOR GROUPS. IF YOU HAVE A LE LABOR -- PROBLEM WITH -- A HOSPITAL -- A BLUE FLU AS AN EXAMPLE THAT THE THE REGULARS COME IN THAT DAY AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET THE NURSE RATIOS IN PLACE AND THEY GOT THESE. HEINOUS CRIMES BUT I WANTED TO GIVE THE OPPOSITION A CHANCE TO RESPOND -- TO MY AT MY QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE RIGIDITY OF THE BILL -- IS THERE ANY AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE OFFERED THE SENATOR TO ENSURE THAT. WHEN YOU HAVE CIRCUMSTANCES OUTSIDE YOUR CONTROL THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE FINE THESE RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY? COMPLETE STRUGGLING BUTTON. I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION RECENTLY ABOUT AMENDMENTS RELATED TO OUR CONCERNS IT UP RELATED TO THE OUT ALL TIMES -- AND I'M I HAD DON'T HAVE THAT RIGGS IN FRONT OF ME BUT I DO. I AM CONCERNED THAT -- A NURSE STEPPING OFF THE FLOOR IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE AN EMERGENCY CONSIDER UNDERTHAT REGULATION I THINK THAT IS CONSIDERED WHEN YOU THINK OF A STATE F EMERGENCY -- TYPE SITUATION SO I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT RATE I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME -- BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IS THAT. THAT THAT'S MORE RELATED TO A SURGE IN AND OUT A SEARCH TYPE OF AN AS OPPOSED -- TO AN EVENT WHERE YOU KNOW PREGNANT NURSE NEEDS TO STOP OFF FOR A MINUTE AND THEN COME BACK ON SO. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU DID EITHER YEAH WELL I I DON'T WE HAVE NOT HAD RECENT CONVERSATION RELATED TO AN INTEREST ON I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE ANSWERS SAID THE LAW IS NOT DESIGNED TO PROPERLY FIND THOSE HOSPITALS THAT ARE KNOWING FULLY NOT. CURRENTLY USING STAFF THERE HAVE BEEN A LINE OR TWO RELATED TO THE HABITUAL -- AND WE DO BELIEVE WITH PATIENT HARM IS INVOLVED THE CURRENT FINE STRUCTURE. THERE'S A LIST OF THEM EVERY QUARTER. OF HOSPITALS THAT ARE FIND RELATED TO PATIENT HARM SO -- WE ATTEND OF TEN TO FIFTEEN UNFORTUNATELY AND AND IF STAFFING RATIOS WERE FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION DURING THAT IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY -- PENALTY IT WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE DOCUMENT THAT CITY PH POSTS ONLINE I I KNOW THAT I HAVE SEEN -- ONE IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY WHICH IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FINE THAT ON THAT INCLUDED A STAFFING RATIO VIOLATION. IF THERE WERE OTHER PROBLEMS -- IN THAT SURVEY THAT THAT THE HOSPITAL JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO EITHER OF YOU HOW PREVALENT IS -- NURSING RATIO VIOLATIONS -- OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA. IS IT A PREVALENT PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE KNOW HOW PREVALENT THEY ARE I THINK WE UNDERSTAND HOSPITALS HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME STAFFING IN AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE IT'S HARD TO FIND NURSES. AND WE DO HEAR ABOUT THAT -- I KNOW THAT DURING FLU SEASON OUR HOSPITALS ARE STRAINED -- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A DATA SET RELATED -- TO RELATED TO THAT INFORMATION AT THIS POINT THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND FIFTY OR SO -- VIOLATIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT FOUND I GUESS WHEN COMMITTEE ASKED THEM THAT THAT QUESTION. OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD ENTERTAINMENT PER GALLAGHER MUCH AND WE WE PROBABLY EMPLOYEE I WOULD GUESS TWO HUNDRED TO TURN OVER TWO THOUSAND NURSES ACROSS THE STATE. I WOULD PROBABLY. ELEVEN SHIFT TODAY. TWELVE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SHOWS A DAY OKAY. THANK YOU A CENTERS GROWTH. CAN I ASK YOU TO REPEAT THAT NUMBER AND I DO APOLOGIZE HI I'M TAKING A GUESS BUT I'M GONNA GUESS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND NURSES A YEAR -- AND PLEASE DON'T QUOTE ME -- AND ESTIMATE AND THEN M. IF ARE ALIVE OR IF WE HAVE AN AVERAGE OF ELEVEN DEPARTMENTS EACH APARTMENT HAS AT LEAST TWO SHIFTS EIGHT OF TWENTY TWO SHIFTS. EACH SHIFT TURN -- CAN CREATE ISSUES AS WELL. I THINK WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON A ABSOLUTE I'M SURE THE PERSON LISTENING RIGHT NOW IS THE ONLY A WEEK SOMETHING ON NUMBER OKAY. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO YOU. I'D LIKE TO THINK THE NURSES MY DAUGHTER IS A NURSE AND SHE'S AMID SURGEON -- SO -- I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT THE JOB IT IS -- BUT I DO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE SITTING NEXT TO ME DOES IT NGUYEN AND YOU LOOK AT ALL NURSES AT ALL TIMES. I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS BECAUSE MY CONCERN BASICALLY IS LIKE MENTIONED IF A PREGNANT NURSERY NURSE AT INNINGS ACOSTA FOR FLIRTATION WHAT EVER -- YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER IS AT YOU KNOW BEEN LATE TO WORK -- SHE VERY GOOD NURSE BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND SIXTY FIVE SO I GET ALL THAT -- I ALSO -- KNOW THAT CURRENT EXISTING FINES ARE AT DISCRETION SO SUPPOSE SOMEBODY DOES COME INTO -- DO A CHECK OR THERE IS A PHONE CALL TO THE THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND THEY COME IN. AND YOU ARE NOT MEETING THOSE EXACT STAFFING RATIOS AND THEY DO AN INVESTIGATION I FACT THEY FIND OUT THAT AND A NURSE GOT CALLED BECAUSE SCHOOLS THE SCHOOL CALLED I HAD AN EMPLOYEE HERE AT THIS IF THE BUILDING TO SEE OTHER DAY THE SCHOOL CALLED AND SAID YOU KNOW. YOU'RE SENDS REALLY SICK YOU HAVE TO LEAVE AND COME PICK HIM UP SO SHE LEFT. SO IF YOU HAVE THAT SITUATION AND A NURSES OFF THE FLOOR THE NEW WOULD BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. A RIGHT NOW THE THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY COULD MY UNDERSTANDING IS COULD SAY WELL YOU KNOW THIS LADY JUST LEFT FOR THIS NURSES LEFT FIVE MINUTES AGO. AND THIS PERSON WAS OFF THE FLOOR GOING TO THE BATHROOM SO THEREFORE WE CAN SAY THERE'S NO FINE. AND MY UNDERSTAND IS BILL DOES NOT ALLOW DISCRETION IS THAT TRUE NO THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL FOR ME SENATOR ABSOLUTELY -- AS I SAID BEFORE THAT THE HOSPITAL MUST DEMONSTRATE THEIR BEST EFFORTS SO IF SOMEONE LEAVES OFF THE FLOOR IF SOMEONE IS LACTATING -- IF SOMEONE HAS LEE BECAUSE THEY'RE SICK OF HAVE TO GO PICK UP AN ILL CHILD. I WOULD THINK THAT THE HOSPITAL CALLING TO TRY AND BRING NURSES IN TO IMMEDIATELY FILL THAT POSITION WOULD BE A BEST EFFORT IT ALSO ALSO TO THE OPPOSITION'S -- SENATOR STONE'S QUESTION AND IT ISN'T FOR EMERGENCIES THAT SAYS MÃ¹T OR OVER WHAT INSTANCES WHERE A NURSE GET SICK OR INJURED ON THE JOB AND AN INSPECTION IS UNDER WAY. THE HOSPITAL JUST MUST DEMONSTRATE PROMPT EFFORTS WERE MADE SO RATHER THAN JUST ALLOWING THAT SHIFT TO GO ON FILLED WE ARE ASKING THAT THE HOSPITAL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO FILL THAT SHIFT AND GET BACK INTO COMPLIANCE. SORRY IS THERE ARE YOU UNDER THE IMPRESSION CENTER LEAVE IT AT THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T MAKE EVERY ABSOLUTELY MY DAUGHTER GETS CALLED IN ON SHIPS THAT ARE HER SHIFT WITH TIME. NOT NOT EVERY HOSPITAL OBVIOUSLY EMMA BUT WE WOULDN'T IT WE WILL I WOULDN'T BE HERE AGAIN WITH THIS BILL IF THERE WASN'T A PROBLEM IF THERE WAS NOT A COMPLIANCE PROBLEM. WE INTRODUCE THE BILL TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE THERE WAS A COMPLIANCE PROBLEM THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT BUT I FEEL SO STRONGLY AND PASSIONATELY ABOUT PEOPLE'S CARE PEOPLE'S HEALTH CARE. I'VE HAD LOVED ONES IN THE HOSPITAL I KNOW WE YOU KNOW THAT WE HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THERE'S TWO HUNDRED AND SOME ODD THOUSAND OUR SHIPS AND WHATNOT IN ONLY. SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR ALLEGATIONS REPORT TO CD EIGHT CITY PH BUT WHAT IF YOUR LOVED ONE WAS ONE OF THOSE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR TIMES WHEN SOMEONE WAS NOT WHEN THE HOSPITALS OUT OF COMPLIANCE. NOT EVERY HOSPITALS OUT OF COMPLIANCE BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH HOSPITALS OUT OF COMPLAINTS THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR THE BILL. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THAT IF YOU FIND THESE HOSPITALS SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INCIDENT WHEN THERE'S JUST A NURSE IT'S LATE FOR WORK. OR SOMEBODY HAS LEFT THE FLOOR SOMETIMES AS HOSPITALS WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THOSE PENALTIES AND FINES AND THEN WE HAVE ZERO HEALTH CARE SERVICE AND I DO APPRECIATE THE RULE EXEMPTION BECAUSE A LOT OF MY DISTRICT IS RULE. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION -- MY COLLEAGUE KINDA HIGHLIGHTED ON IT BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THAT. IS THIS ANOTHER MECHANISM THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST THE HOSPITALS IN LABOR DISPUTE SO BASICALLY YOU HAVEN'T 90% OF YOUR NURSES WALK OFF THE FLOOR. AND BECAUSE THERE'S A LABOR DISPUTE IN THE HOSPITAL WAS RESPONSIBLE -- FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE NURSES RATIO IS MATT. AND IT'S AN INCIDENT THAT CAUSED BY THE NURSES ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES. AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE HOSPITALS TO COMPLY SO IS THERE AN EXEMPTION. FOR SELF IMPOSED. THERE IS A RATIO KNOWN ON EXEMPTION BUT I WOULD SAY THIS. EVERY NURSE I'VE EVER MET ALL THE NURSES THAT ARE HERE I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY OF THEM WALKING OFF THE JOB AND RISKING PATIENT SAFETY OUR PATIENTS LIVES OVER LABOR DISPUTE. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GONE INTO NURSING IF THEY DID NOT CARE DEEPLY ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT THEY ARE CARING FOR SO THERE IS NO EXEMPTION NO MA'AM THERE IS NOT BUT I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF NURSES WALKED OFF THE JOB AND JEOPARDIZED. PATIENTS HEALTH OVER LABOR DISPUTE I CAN GIVE YOU A HOSPITAL WHERE NURSES DID STRIKE OKAY AND SO -- I DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THAT -- OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WELCOME ALSO JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE THAT IS THE SECOND FIND THE FIRST A SOLUTION IS. THIRTY THOUSAND SECOND ONE IS SIXTY THOUSAND AND MOST OF OUR HOSPITALS ARE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR IF NOT BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES WE DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS IS SOMETHING SO SIGNIFICANT THIS FINE THAT WOULD PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AYE -- THEY DID HAVE -- COUPLE QUESTIONS -- IS THE FIRST OF ALL SWIMMING NOTE THAT THE FINES -- THAT BASICALLY IF A VIAL IT BASICALLY MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS ON THE SAME INSPECTION SURVEY ACTUALLY COUNT AS ONE VIOLATION RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WELL I ALWAYS FIND FIVE SO IT'S THIRTY SIXTY SIX EIGHTY SIX THAT IT. JUST THIRTY RIGHT. NOW AND IF THEY FOUND IT AGAIN ANOTHER INSPECTION THEN IT GOES UP TO SIXTY BUT IT COULD EVEN BE HOPEFULLY NOT BUT MULTIPLE INCIDENTS OCCURRED. THAT IS INCORRECT AND THEN THE OTHER. QUESTION I GUESS I HAVE THE THE END AND I AND I AND I APPRECIATE -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU HAVE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE LET'S SAY SOMEONE THESE GO OFF THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING -- BUT THERE'S ALSO THE PART OF ME THAT SAYS IN NIGHT THAT THOSE RESERVES RECTOR SIDE USUALLY ENOUGH DOCTORS IN A RESERVE DOCTORS AROUND RIGHT. AND YOU HAVE. TO SO THIS IS IF WE HAVE A SYSTEM. RIGHT AS YOU KNOW THERE'S TRAFFIC I HER TRAFFICKING ALSO IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A SYSTEM. WHERE BASICALLY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT AT THE EDGE? AND THEN OF ONE LITTLE THING HAPPENS A TIP THAT ALL OVER RIGHT WILL BE SHORT. AND FACE A WORD HEALTH CARE HEALTH GIMME THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT THAT WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING LÃ  ACCIDENT SO WE CAN GET THEIR ACCIDENT LIKE YOU KNOW A BUS AND NOW WE HAVE MUCH PATIENTS COME IN. I MEAN YOU HAVE TO AND AND I'M AND THIS IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CERTAINLY CAN TALK ABOUT BUT ANOTHER TYPE THING WE HAVE TO HAVE A BUFFER. TO RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WE'RE NOT IT'S SO WHAT I'M HEARING ABOUT IS THAT I MEAN IN TERMS OF STAFFING YOU SHOULD YOU NEED TO HAVE. YEAH AT LEAST A LITTLE RESERVE THERE BECAUSE THINGS DO HAPPEN I MEAN LEARN HEALTHCARE THINGS HAPPENED UNEXPECTEDLY. AND THEY HAPPENED THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS SO FREQUENTLY IT NEEDS TO BE EXPECTED. RIGHT I MEAN IT JUST DOESN'T TO DAY AND YEAH WE CAN TALK ABOUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH AND IN EXACTLY IN THE AND I APPRECIATE US EARLIER YOU MENTIONED THAT -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BEST EFFORT RIGHT AND I THINK THIS IS THE THIS IS PART OF THE BEST EFFORT NOW DO YOU DOREEN WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT WE NEED TO HAVE TO NURSES FOR EVERYONE AND IT'S AT BUT YOU DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST. A LITTLE BIT OF A WITH THE RESERVE BECAUSE IF NOTHING ELSE. YOU KNOW THE THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT SO THE HOSPITAL'S A LITTLE LET MORE EMPTY YOU KNOW I'D BE JUST STAFFING RIGHT AT THE EDGE. AND SO I I THINK THAT WHEN WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT LIKE LITTLE THINGS OUT YOU HAVE A BIG SYSTEMATIC PROFIT SO I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS IS THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IT IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY AND TO ME ACTUALLY. AS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD TO ENFORCE WORK HOURS RESIDENCIES LIKE SOMEONE WHO STAFF JUST AT THE EDGE THAT'S A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM THAT'S ACTUALLY SYSTEMATIC VIOLATIONS OF TECHNICALLY IS NOT A VIOLATION BECAUSE THEY WILL WE CAN CROSS THE LINE WE'RE RIGHT AT IT BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS IT'S UPSET OVER THAT. MEANSYOU SYSTEMATICALLY DESIGNED IT SO THAT YOU THAT WOULD HAPPEN GIVEN SPECIALLY VARIATION. SO I MEAN I YEAH I I AM A I SO I CERTAINLY HEAR ABOUT AND NOW I KNOW I DON'T WANT HOSPITAL'S NICKEL AND DIME BUT THE SAME TIME I THINK THE FLIP SIDE THOSE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE INSTITUTIONS -- WHEN THEY WHEN YOU SEE A NURSE STAFFING RATIO YOU'RE NOT JUST STABBING EXACTLY AT THAT POINT OR JUST A LITTLE YOU NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH OF RESERVE TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY CROSSING THAT LINE THAT IT THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE NORMAL? THAT YOU'RE THAT EVERY LITTLE THING BECAUSE YOU NOW TO HAVE TO CROSS THAT LINE IT SHOULD BE LIKE VERY UNUSUAL EVENTS BECAUSE THE CAUSE THAT TO HAPPEN. READ DID YOU WANNA SAY SOMETHING LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS TO STAFF OVER THE RATIO BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MANAGE MEAL AND REST BREAKS BUT DURING FLU SEASONS OR EVENTS WHERE THE HOSPITAL. MAY HAVE A PATIENT TURN OVER IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT I THINK THE FRUSTRATING PART IS THE WAY WE READ THE BILL THE REGULATORY SECTION REFERRED TO IS THE OUT ALL TIME SECTION IT DOES NOT REFER. TO THE SECTION SHE'S TALKING ABOUT IT IS THE AT ALL TIMES IN THERE ARE INSTANCES HAVING WORKED IN A HOSPITAL WHERE YOU KNOW. THAT YOU CAN HAVE NURSES STEP OFF THE FLOOR UNEXPECTEDLY AND IN THOSE INSTANCES WE STRUGGLE AND WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL COMBINED WITH OTHER OFFERS -- COULD COST OUR HOSPITAL SO I THINK IF THE GOAL IS TO GO AFTER VISUAL -- OFFENDERS THAT'S ONE THING BUT THIS BILL THE WAY WE READ THAT STOP THE REGULATORY SECTION IT IS AT ALL TIMES OKAY SOONER BUT I UNDERSTAND IT ALSO I MEAN WELL CERTAINLY. SOME IT IS ALSO A COMPLAINT DRIVEN THAT IT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SECTIONS EVERY THREE YEARS RIGHT. YOU CAN ALSO A COMPLAINT CAN LOOK BACK OR YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS DIVERT GIVEN CERTAIN SITUATIONS RIGHT OF WHICH ACTUALLY IF YOU HAD MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS THAT WOULD BE ONE FINE. THAT YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE LANES OVER MULTIPLE DAYS. OKAY WELL. YOU KNOW WHAT I I URGE THE IT THE SPURS YOU CAN WORK OUT SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT I THINK THE OVERALL -- I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER ENFORCEMENT WHERE -- RECOGNIZING THAT YOU NEED TO STILL DESIGN YOUR SYSTEMS WITH SOME RESILIENCY. AND THAT AND AND AND THAT -- AND AND THAT'S PART OF SHOWING YOU USING YOUR BEST EFFORT IN MY MIND SO -- A SO I CERTAINLY THINK THE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO CONTINUE. AND AND BUT YEAH I THINK. I I THINK THAT -- WE WE NEED TO MOVE THE BILL FORD -- TODAY SELF -- WITH THAT -- SIR NO OTHER COMMENT THEN -- SIR LABEL WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I THINK YOU IN CAPS SLATED IT VERY WELL WHEN YOU SAID THAT WHEN YOUR STAFFING RIGHT AT THE EDGE THAT CAN LEAD TO A LOT OF PROBLEMS. pALWAYS WILLING AND OUR DOORS ALWAYS OPEN TO TALK TO OPPOSITION IF WE CAN GET TO SOME PLACE WHERE REYES A LITTLE HAPPIER LITTLE UNHAPPY WE'VE HAD A GOOD NEGOTIATION. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I FEEL INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT THESE NURSES TO AND THE FACT THE HOSPITAL'S OF HAD TWENTY YEARS TO GET IT RIGHT AND THEY HAVE NOT. SO THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PATIENTS ARE SAFE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE THE NURSES ARE SAFE BECAUSE THEY DO VERY HARD JOBS MUCH HARDER THAN WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY AND PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE LITERALLY ON THE LINE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OKAY -- IS OUR MOTION ON THE BILL. WELL AS I UNDERSTAND FROM THE RULES THAT I CAN I CAN MOVE IT AS A COURTESY NORMALLY I DON'T DO IS THE CHAIR BUT SINCE MANY OF MEMBERS ARE APPS AND OTHER COMMITTEES I WILL MOVE THE BILL AND SEC -- SECRETARY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS A SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AN BY AN ICE STONE. STONE NO DORADO GROVE. GROVE NO FURTADO LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MONNING RUBIO. THE ACCOUNT IS SET -- TO TO ALL CALL THE ROLL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE -- ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR A ON THE SIDE. THAT IS NOT [inaudible] SELECT THE RIGHT. GET A CALL BACK. OUT IN CASE THAT AARON AND I GUESS ONE OF YEAH SIX MONTHS AGO. RIGHT OKAY [inaudible] AND SO BASICALLY. THE ALL THE ONES. OKAY LEAST AS MAKING RIGHT [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. WE WORK WITH. OKAY. YEAH KNOWN THAT'S ARE YOU. OKAY. TO BEGIN WITH YEAH OKAY YES SIR LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN I WILL BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS HOWEVER I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE AMENDMENTS -- TAKEN DO IGNORE THE REALITY OF MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING WORKERS ACROSS THE GLOBE WHO ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS HEALTH THREATS SUCH AS OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA ALLERGIES AND ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION. SALON WORKERS WHO ARE LARGELY WOMEN NEED TO KNOW WHAT FRAGRANCE ALLERGENS ARE IN THE PRODUCTS THEY USE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM ASTHMA RELATED EXPOSURES. AND OTHER HARMFUL HEALTH IMPACTS PROFESSIONAL SALON WORKERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPLODES SUPPOSED TO FRAGRANCES IN THE WORKPLACE HAIR DRESSERS AND BEAUTICIANS HEAVY FORTY SEVEN FOLD HIGHER INCREASE. OF FRAGRANT SKIN ALLERGIES THE PEOPLE AND OTHER OCCUPATIONS WORKERS AND CONSUMERS ALSO NEED MORE INFORMATION TO AVOID THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING COMPOUNDS EDCS. ON HEALTHY PRENATAL AND CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT BREAST AND OTHER CANCERS INFERTILITY AND A HOST OF OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS SO ALTHOUGH WE ARE PUTTING THESE CONCERNS AND ISSUES ASIDE TODAY. I REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THESE ISSUES IN THE YEARS TO COME. MEMBERS SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR ON DESIGNATED AN-AUTHORITATIVE HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL LISTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. HEALTH SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WILL EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH PRODUCTS TO USE WITH THEIR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND EVEN THEMSELVES. TO NOTE THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN ANY PRODUCT INGREDIENTS OR REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL PRODUCT LABELING. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR ALT ALSO PROTECTS THE CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION INCLUDING PRODUCT INGREDIENT FORMULAS THAT IS NOT IDENTIFIED AS HARMFUL BUT BY AUTHORITATIVE BODIES TODAY IN CALIFORNIA. THE PUBLIC KNOWS MORE ABOUT FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS IN CLEANING PRODUCTS THAT ABOUT THOSE THAT THEY USED TO CLEAN AND THEN WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE PERFUME OUR BODIES WITH. PUT ANOTHER WAY WE NOR BUT MORE ABOUT THE FLOOR CLEANER AND DISINFECTANTS IN OUR SHAMPOOS DEODORANTS AND BODY SPRAYS. WE ALSO KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE FLAVORS IN CHOPSTICKS MOUTHWASH AND LIP GLOSS. MANY OF THE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN POTENTIALLY HARMFUL FLAVORS. ARE MARKED BY THEIR MARKETED TO CHILDREN WITH KRISPY KREME DONUTS AND ICE CREAM FLAVORS. ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE AT RISK OF EXPOSURE TO SECRET HAZARDOUS FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS AND RELATED HARMFUL CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS CHILDREN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND PREGNANT WOMEN. CURRENTLY NO STATE OR FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR INGREDIENTS TO CONSUMERS OR REGULATORY AGENCIES. THIS LOOPHOLE ALLOWS CHEMICALS TO HIDE UNDER THE WORD FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR ON THE LABELS OF THE BEAUTY PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WITH LITTLE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. OF THE SAFETY CONCERNS. YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF ON THE LABELS OF THE PRODUCTS YOU USE EVERY MORNING AND EVERY NIGHT. THOUSANDS OF SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS ARE USED TO CREATE FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS A COMPARABLE COMPRISE THE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WE USE EVERY DAY. MY FAVORITE LIP GLOSS I'D IT'S FLAVORED BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS IN IT AND WHAT IS FLAVORED WITH. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE PERFUME SHAMPOOS MOISTURIZERS LIPSTICKS AND HAIR STYLING PRODUCTS. SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LEAD TO NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS RANGING FROM ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO REPRODUCTIVE HARM AND INCREASED RISK OF BREAST BREAST CANCER. FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS CAN BE FOUND IN MORE THAN 95% OF SHAMPOOS CONDITIONERS HAIR STYLING PRODUCTS ANTIPERSPIRANT AND SHAVING PRODUCTS AS WELL AS FINE FRAGRANCES BODIES BRAND LOTIONS. IN FACT ONE THIRD OF FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS CURRENTLY IN USE HAVE BEEN LINKED TO NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS. IT IS CURRENTLY. LEGAL FOR COMPANIES TO NOT DISCLOSE THESE INGREDIENTS HOWEVER IN RESPONSE TO GROWING CONSUMER DEMAND SOME COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN DISCLOSING FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS IN TEIR PRODUCTS AND BIG RETAILERS ARE BEGINNING TO DEMAND. INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE AS A CONDITION OF SELLING PRODUCTS IN THEIR STORES. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WILL BE THE CATALYST NEEDED TO ENSURE THE CONSUMERS KNOW THE PRESENCE OF HARMFUL INGREDIENTS AND ALL THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF BUYING. WITH THIS BILL WE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT CONSUMERS AND WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INGREDIENTS ARE IN THEIR BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE DAILY. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA IS ONCE AGAIN A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEADER ON PUBLIC HEALTH. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR REPRESENTS THE STRONGEST DISCLOSURE LAW DISCLOSURE LAW IN THE COUNTRY AND RARE AND ACROSS THE WORLD OF HARMFUL FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS MEGAN WHITNEY HIT ME FOUNDER AND CEO OF TRUE BOTH TENTACLES DR WILLIAM GOODSON SENIOR SCIENTIST WITH THE CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE. AND WHEN APPROPRIATE I'LL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA -- SIX MINUTES TOTAL SERVICE TO WITNESSES KEEP THAT IN MIND THANK YOU. FOR THE MEMBERS MY NAME IS WILLIAM GOTTEN FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN A BREAST CANCER DOCTOR FIVE STUDY PRESS CANCER I'VE TREATED BREAST CANCER ARE DIAGNOSED I KNOW IT WELL. FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS I HAVE CO LEAD A TEAM STUDYING HOW ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS INFLUENCE WHAT HAPPENS IN NORMAL BREAST TISSUE BEFORE IT BECOMES MALIGNANT. ALL OF THE SEA BREEZE AND ARE TOUCHED BY AND MAKE SURE IN VITAMIN CHEMICALS EVERY DAY. MOST OF THEM WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS ARE PROVING CARCINOGENS THE ONLY BIG QUESTION IS HOW MANY OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS OTHER CHEMICALS CAUSE CANCER. UNTIL FINAL ANSWERS ARE AVAILABLE PRUDENT PERSON MIGHT WANT TO CHOOSE TO AVOID SUSPECTING SUSPECTED TOXIC CHEMICALS. IN THE DO THE TO DO THIS THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PRODUCTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE COMPLETE CONTENTS OF MAKE UP AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY HIDDEN FROM CALIFORNIANS BY A LABELING NEW POLL. OUR RESEARCH FOR EXAMPLE ASKED YOUNG WOMEN TO CHANGE THEIR COSMETICS FROM THEIR USUAL COSMETICS TO PHTHALATE IMPAIR BEEN FREE COSMETICS FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH WE PROVIDED THEM. WITH FREE COSMETICS THE STRIKING THING WAS THAT S WE BEGAN WE COLLECTED A URINE SAMPLE AND VALLEY IN THEIR URINE EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WHICH WE DETAILS AN INDEX VERY CAREFULLY. LISTED PHTHALATES ON THE LABEL THEREFORE THIS OUT THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. WE KNOW THE PHTHALATES CAME FROM THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE MONTH AFTER THEY HAD BEEN USING PRODUCTS THAT WERE FREE OF PHTHALATES. BUT BALLOTS IN THEIR URINE WENT AWAY THEIR URINE WAS CLEAN SO TO SPEAK. IMPORTANTLY THE YOUNG WOMEN WHO USE THE CUTS OUT OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE GAVE THEM REPORTED THAT THE PRODUCTS WORKED. THEY WERE QUITE COMFORTABLE WITH IT SO YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE THE STUFF IN THE COSMETICS. MANUFACTURERS GROUP THESE CHEMICALS ON THE LABEL BY CALLING THEM FRAGRANCES. AND THEY DON'T REALLY DISCLOSE THAT THE FRAGRANCES INCLUDES PHTHALATES AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH REASONS TO AVOID. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR BODY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE DAY. SOME PHTHALATES NOT BE LEE NOT ALL PHTHALATES BUT SOME PHTHALATES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE IN BREAST CANCER. PHTHALATES ARE KNOWN TO HARM PREGNANT WOMEN AND NEWBORN CHILDREN. ALEX ARE LINKED TO PREECLAMPSIA WHICH IS A HORRIBLE DEVASTATING PROBLEM IN PREGNANCY THAT CAN BE FATAL -- PHTHALATE EXPOSURE IS LINKED TO INCREASED RISK OF GROUP IN A CHILD IN THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE AGAIN A POTENTIALLY FATAL PROBLEM. AND PHTHALATES IN GENERAL ARE LINKED TO CHANGES IN THE GENITALIA OF SMALL BABY BOYS. THIS IS MAINSTREAM SCIENCE SUPPORTED BY WORK AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SAFETY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH THE EUROPEAN USING JAPANESE AND CHINESE RESEARCH CENTERS LOCALLY AT UCSF UC BERKELEY STANFORD OTHER UC CAMPUSES HARVESTED HARVARD ETCETERA. I DISCUSS VALID SAID ALEX AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THAT'S ONE THING THERE ARE MANY THINGS. ADMITTEDLY NOT EVERYTHING BAD THAT CAN HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN TO EVERY WOMAN OR CHILD BUT EVERY PERSON DESERVES THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT CHANCES THEY WILL TAKE FOR THEMSELF TO DO THIS CALIFORNIA'S MUST BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THE PRODUCTS THEY ARE USING. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR PAN THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MEGAN HACKNEY AND THEY'RE GOOD. I'M I'M THE PRESIDENT OF TRUE BOTANICALS MORE SAN FRANCISCO BASED MANUFACTURER OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WE VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE EXACTLY WHAT GOES INTO OUR PRODUCTS SO OUR CONSUMERS DON'T UNKNOWINGLY USE HARMFUL INGREDIENTS. THAT ARE OFTEN OBSCURED UNDER THE FRAGRANCE UMBRELLA. I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS AS YOU'VE HEARD CAN BE FOUND IN THE MAJORITY OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AS DOCTOR GOODS IN JUST SPOKE TO SOME OF THE CHEMICALS USED HAVE BEEN LINKED TO SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE LACK OF FRAGRANT INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE CREATES AN UNFAIR HURDLE FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS ALIKE WHO ARE WANTING TO AVOID ON SAFE CHEMICAL EXPOSURE. THE LACK OF FLAVOR INGREDIENT DISPEL DISCLOSURE IS ALSO A PROBLEM. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF TOOTHPASTE WHICH I HOPE WE ALL USE DALY AND ALSO CONTAIN SECRET CHEMICALS. MY SON'S FAVORITE LIP BALM FALLS VICTIM TO THE SAME ISSUE. AND HE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S THE STRAWBERRY BOMB RATHER THAN USING IT DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS. THIS DISCLOSURE LOOPHOLE ALLOWS DOZENS SOMETIMES EVEN HUNDREDS. OF CHEMICALS TO HIDE UNDER THE WORD FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR ON PRODUCT LABELS WITH NO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT HOUSE CLEANING PRODUCTS AS YOU'VE HEARD BY CONTRAST ARE ALREADY REGULATED IN THIS WAY YET WE'RE NOT BEATING IN MY SAW. I'M EXCITED AND HOPEFUL BECAUSE CLEAN BEAUTY COMPANIES LIKE OURS REPRESENT THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS MARKET RETAIL SALES ARE ESTIMATED TO GENERATE FIFTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY TWENTY DR GAMBLE UNILEVER JOHNSON AND JOHNSON AS WELL AS HUNDREDS OF SMALLER SIZE COMPANIES LIKE OURS ARE VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSING FRAGRANCE IN THERE AND IN THEIR INGREDIENTS SHOWING IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT IS VERY PROFITABLE TO DO SO. JUST YESTERDAY THE ACTORS MISS MICHELLE PFEIFFER LAUNCHED AN ENTIRELY TRANSPARENT FRONT FINE FRAGRANCE COMPANY. SHOWING INNOVATION AND CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT ARE MOVING INTO THE MAINSTREAM. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE CONSUMERS ARE DEMANDING IT. BEING THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT US IT'S THEM AND WE'RE RESPONDING. TO BOTANICALS AND FIFTY SAFE COMPANIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE CONSUMERS AND WORKERS NOT ONLY WANT TO KNOW. BUT HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT HARMFUL INGREDIENTS ARE IN THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT WE ALL BRING HOME TO OUR FAMILIES. AND USE IN OUR WORKPLACES EVERY DAY. SIMPLY PUT FRAGRANCE OF LABOR DISCLOSURE SHOULD BE THE NEW NORMAL FOR OUR INDUSTRY CENTER LEAVE HIS BILLS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS DIRECTION AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT.

MY NAME IS JAN SELDOM VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE FOR THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL. PHD CHEMIST AND A BOARD CERTIFIED TOXICOLOGIST AND I'M HERE ON SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR TO VOICE OUR POSITION IN OPPOSITION UNLESS AMENDED. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENT SO FAR BUT WE STILL HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. TO BEGIN WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP ESTABLISH REGULATIONS AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL THAT PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT FOR COSMETICS. UNDER THE U. S. FEDERAL LAW PERSONAL CARE COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS ON PRODUCT LABELS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FRAGRANCES WHICH FTA ALLOWS TO BE LISTED COLLECTIVELY AS FRAGRANCE. THIS RECOGNIZES THAT FRAGRANCES SHOULD BE PROTECTED. UNDER OUR NATION'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LOSS. FRAGRANCES HAVE VALUE PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY ARE CONFIDENTIAL. FURTHER SB SEVEN OF FIVE SEVENTY FOUR DUKE CLEATS THE WORK ORDER BE DONE ALREADY DONE UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAWS. AND FOR THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL REASONS SHOULD BE REJECTED. THE BELIEVE THE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS PERCENT TO HUMAN HEALTH RISK IS UNFOUNDED. THERE IS A ROBUST PUBLICLY AVAILABLE REVIEW. UNDERTAKEN BY THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR FRAGRANCE MATERIALS EXPERT PANEL ON FRIEDMAN SAFETY. A REVIEW PANEL OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERTS. THIS SYSTEM WORKS. AND DECADES OF CONSUMER EXPERIENCE WITH OUR PRODUCTS DEMONSTRATES THE AMONG THE SAFEST PRODUCTS REGULATED BY FDA. NEXT XP -- SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR RELIES ON TWENTY SEVENTH FLOOR TATE OF LISTS WHICH ARE DUPLICATIVE. SOME NOT ROOTED IN SOUND SCIENCE AND WILL CAUSE CONSUMER CONFUSION. FOR EXAMPLE PROP SIXTY FIVE ESTABLISHES A ROBUST PROCESS. TO REVIEW LISTS OF AUTHORITATIVE BODIES IN THE TERM AND WHICH MATERIALS REQUIRED DISCLOSURE UNDER PROP. SIXTY FIVE THE INCLUSION OF THESE LISTS AND FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WILL MAKE THE ENTIRE PROP SIXTY FIVE PROCESS MOVED. THE CALIFORNIA SAFER COSMETICS PROGRAM THAT INCORPORATES A LIST OF LISTS WHICH INCLUDE PROP. SIXTY FIVE AND OTHER LISTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED AMONG THE TWENTY SEVEN ADDITIONALLY. LISTS ARE -- ARE INCLUDED. WHICH IDENTIFY MATERIALS WHICH ARE PROPOSED TO BE TESTED HAVE NOT. SHOWN TO CAUSE ANY ADVERSE EFFECT. AND OTHER LISTS WHICH IN FACT ESTABLISH SAFE EXPOSURE LEVELS FOR MATERIALS. FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU. FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR UNLESS AMENDED. UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH THE OTHER AUTHORS AND SPONSORS LATE LAST WEEK AND HOPE THIS COMMITTEE RESERVES ITS RIGHT. TO HEAR AND SEE THIS BILL AGAIN AS IT IS DESCRIBED AS A WORK IN PROGRESS. AS AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS OPENLY LABELS PRODUCTS TO THE INGREDIENTS SINCE THE SEVENTIES. WE ARE EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU AND CRAFT A THOUGHTFUL. THE PROGRAM TO ASSURE THE CONSUMERS -- SAFETY -- WHILE PROMOTING SCIENCE BASED REGULATIONS THAT PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COOKING YOURS ON BEHALF OF THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION ARE ASSOCIATION AS THE PRINCIPAL TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE FRAGRANCE INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR OUR MEMBERS CREATE AND MANUFACTURE THE FRAGRANCES INCENSE THAT ARE USED IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS HOME CARE PRODUCTS. WE ALSO REPRESENT FRIEDEN FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS SUPPLIERS AND FINISHED PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS OF FRAGRANCE CONTAINING PRODUCTS. THE FRAGRANCE INDUSTRY FIRST AND FOREMOST IS COMMITTED TO THE SAFETY OF OUR PRODUCTS THE INDUSTRY ESTABLISH THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE A FRAGRANCE MATERIALS IN. NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THE ORGANIZATION CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE FRAGRANCE PALETTE INGREDIENTS AND PLACES RESTRICTIONS ON INGREDIENTS AND HAS BANNED INGREDIENTS ON THE SCIENCE SUPPORTED THE NEED TO DO SO. EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A FORMAL GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO TAKE THE INGREDIENT COMMUNICATION OF THE MATERIALS WE USE VERY SERIOUSLY WE ARE RESPONDING TO THE INCREASED DESIRE OF CONSUMERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S IN THE PRODUCTS THE USE EVERY DAY. OUR MEMBERS TRIVE TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS WO ARE THE COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS TO DELIVER THAT INFORMATION TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THE UNIQUENESS OF THESE PROPRIETARY BLENDS WHICH IS THE ARTISTRY OUR MEMBERS HAVE BUILT THEIR BUSINESS AROUND. AND WE HOPE WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT BOUNCE IN SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE SPONSORS FOR THE AMENDMENTS WHICH DO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS BUT QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE REMAINING CONCERNS ON ABOUT -- WELL WE APPRECIATE THE NEW TITLE OF THE ACT AS WELL AS THE CHANGES MADE TO CERTAIN ASPECTS IN THE INTENT LANGUAGE. OUT WE DO YOU HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS WITH HOW SOME OF THE INFORMATION IS DRAFTED -- AD HOW. IT IT PORTRAYS THE THE INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR IN THE MATERIALS WE USE THEM ALL BE OFFERING A SUGGESTION STOP COMMUNICATING CONTEXTUALIZE THAT INFORMATION -- ON THE ALLERGENS -- AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE THRESHOLD FOR THE FRAGRANCE ALLERGENS TO TRIGGER DISCLOSURE UNDER THIS BILL. THIS WAS THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS REACHED IN SB TWO FIFTY EIGHT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THIS CONSISTENCY -- ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES AND REGIONS OF THE WORLD. AND LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE REMOVAL IN PARTICULAR OF THE A. L. EASY ASTHMA JOURNALISTS AND THE DANISH AND CONSTRUCTOR LIST WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY IN THE BILL. HOWEVER WE DO BELIEVE THAT ALL THE DOZEN A LIST THAT. MAY END UP IN THE FINAL VERSION THE RELIABLE AUTHORITATIVE LESS THAT ARE PEER REVIEWED SCIENCE BASE AND AVAILABLE FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS. SO WE APPRECIATE THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THE AUTHOR HAS CONVENE AND WE ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ON HOW BEST TO COMMUNICATE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON CAP CAME ACU CAP CAN ASSOCIATES HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WILL IN MY COMMENTS ARE WITH THOSE WHO SPOKE AND AN OPPOSING THE CEMENT A POSITION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING AT THE AUTHOR AND PROPONENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ADAM WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR THE IT DOMINANCE TAKEN BUT WE A DISH ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL CONCERN SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANKS THANK YOU. OKAY SEEN OTHER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF CENTER GROVE JUST -- ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO -- THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THESE -- INTERNATIONALLY -- RECOGNIZE GROUP OF EXPERTS THAT ARE EVALUATING THAT THIS AYE SOON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF SOME OF THESE -- FRAGRANCES -- AND THAT THE FDA HAS A ROLE AS WELL COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE ON THOSE. TWO ARE CERTAINLY -- OF THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FRAGRANCE MATERIALS OPERATES COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW PROGRAM OF ALL COSMETIC -- ALL FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS -- IT IS A RESEARCH INSTITUTE WHICH HAS -- A EXPERT TO A PANEL OF A INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERTS -- THEY REPAIR REPORTS I'M IN THE EXPERTS -- OPINE ON THE SAFETY OF THESE -- ROOM -- REVIEWS MAY RESULT IN A CONCLUSION THAT THE MATERIAL IS SAFE OF THAT THE MATERIAL IS SAFE WITH RESTRICTIONS OR THE MATERIAL IS PROHIBITED -- THOUGH WHOSE -- CONCLUSIONS ARE THEN ADVANCED THROUGH THE TRADE ASSOCIATION -- AND OUR OWN OBLIGATION OF MEMBERSHIP -- FOR MEMBERS WHICH REPRESENT OVER 90% OF THE OF FRAGRANCES SOLDO WORLDWIDE. ALSO IT IS ON THE FLOOR TATE OF A BODY OF WHICH CHAU PUBLISHES -- THEY REPORTS IN -- IN PUBLIC -- AND PEOPLE CAN REVIEW THEM ACT. SO A SENSE OF THE R. F. M. IS BEEN IN EXISTENCE -- I ASSUME FOR MANY YEARS -- HAS THERE BEEN ANY CASES OF ANY TOXICITIES -- THAT HAVE RESULTED IN MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE FRAGRANCES THAT WERE LISTED. OF I AM UNAWARE THAT THERE ARE ANY OKAY ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY INSTANCES. WHERE ANY COSMETICS OF BECAUSE MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH? BRING THE MEN I MEAN WHEN I WHEN I WAS A PHARMACY SCHOOL THESE A SAFE YOU CAN IF YOU CAN BRING THAT IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD. SO -- IN FACT IT KIND OF GOES -- TO ONE OF THE LEVELS OF RECOVER OF RESEARCH -- SEE HERE -- FOR THE CDC IT SAYS -- LET'S SEE HERE [inaudible] THAT. IF IT'S A DESIGNATED W. IT'S JUST THE TAXES IN THE BLOOD OF THE YEAR AND IT DOESN'T -- SAY THAT FITS TOXIC OR OR NON TOXIC WE WE WE APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF THE CDC LIST WHICH IS EXACTLY THAT IT'S ASSEMBLY OF THE PRESENCE. OF THERE'S NO RISK ASSESSMENT DONE THERE'S NO SUGGESTION BY CDC THAT THE PRESENCE -- IS EITHER AN INDICATION THAT THE MATERIAL IS SAFE OR UNSAFE. WELL WE ARE FULLY CONFIDENT THAT THROUGH THE INDUSTRY RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL AS THE ASSESSMENT OF EXTERNAL OF REVIEW BODIES INCLUDING. OF THE REFORM OF GROUP FOR FRAGRANCES AS WELL AS THE COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW FOR COST MEDIC INGREDIENTS TAT THE MATERIALS THAT ARE IN THE MARKET ARE SAFE THEY ARE USED SAFELY. OKAY AND THEN THE YOUNG LADY THAT REPRESENT A LOT OF THE FRAGRANCE COMPANIES CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE UPPER PART TERRY SECRETS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THOSE FRAGRANCES AND IF. THOSE INGREDIENTS THAT ARE MAKING UP THOSE FRAGRANCES ARE -- PLACED ON BOTTLES FOR THE WORLD TO SEE -- WHAT WOULD STOP ANYONE IN THE WORLD FROM DUPLICATING THOSE? NON PATENTABLE -- INGREDIENTS RIGHT SURE -- YEAH AS YOU MENTIONED SO ARE -- FORMULATIONS ARE NOT PATENTABLE -- AND SO WHENEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE INGREDIENTS WITH CONSUMERS WERE REALLY ALSO CONSIDERING THAT COMMUNICATION IS GONNA GO TO OUR COMPETITORS RIGHT AND SO ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR SORT OF YOUR RECIPE OUT THERE IT DOESN'T. TAKE MUCH FOR THE SCIENTISTS THAT WORK FOR MAYBE YOUR COMPETITORS TO TO PIECE TOGETHER EXACTLY YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF THIS AND A LOT OF THAT AND GET VERY VERY CLOSE -- TO TO YOUR PROPRIETARY BLEND SO THAT'S WHY WE TAKE THESE -- CONSIDERATION SO ERIOUSLY WE CERTAINLY WANT CONSUMERS TO HAVE THE SAFETY INFORMATION THAT THEY THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE PURCHASING DECISIONS INFORMED PURCHASING DECISIONS BUT WE ALSO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONTACTS IMPORTANT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THE CHAIR MY COLLEAGUE ASKED THEM THE QUESTION TAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS THE PATENTED ISSUE ONE THAT ON THE FRAGRANCE LINE SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I HE ASKED MY QUESTION THANK YOU -- MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ENJOY THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS IT BOTH LEGISLATIVELY IN THE BUDGET -- AND WHAT'S CLEAR TO ME IS THAT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY THAT THAT WE STILL HAVE CLEAR CORPS DIVISIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY -- THOSE IN THE HEALTH. OF TE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY WORLD AND SO I THINK A SIMPLE. UP OR DOWN VOTE ON THIS BILL ISN'T GOING TO RESOLVE IT. I'M CURIOUS I HEARD IT WAS PUT I% WASPLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY TWO THINGS I THINK ABOUT DOES MY HISTORY IN THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE HERE THIS ISSUE. NUMBER ONE THE SHEER NEW NUMBER OF COMPANIES IS A WHOLE NEW INDUSTRY THAT'S EMERGING QUITE FRANKLY THAT APPEARS TO WANT TO GIVE CONSUMERS AN ALTERNATIVE -- AND SO THAT WAS DIFFERENT THAT I'VE NOTED. THE SECOND THING IS I TIP MY HAT TO YOU FOR ENGAGING IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND THAT THE OPPOSITE YOU COULD SAY THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WAS TRACKING ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE FROM MY HEARD WE'RE DEALING WITH TERMINOLOGY I APPRECIATE YOU DON'T WITH THE TERM TOXIC USE THAT I GET THAT -- AND SO YOU REMOVE THE AISLES BUT IF THE OPPOSITION -- TO THE CHAIR COULD GIVE ME A HIGH LEVEL KIND OF SUMMARY OF THE CORE ISSUES. THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE AMENDMENTS -- BOTH THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AND THE CHAIR HAS AGREED TO TAKE. I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S LEFT THE CURRENT GAS. AND YOU KNOW AND I AND I'M AND I'M ASKING THIS ISSUE LET ME ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS OF PUSHING HARD ON THIS. BECAUSE I GET BOTH SIDES I ALSO REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS LIKE SEVEN MANUFACTURERS -- SO I'M. I NEED TO HEAR THE DIFFERENCE THANK YOU. WELL I THINK THE CORE ISSUE FOR US IS REALLY THE LISTS OF LISTS -- AND WHETHER THEY ARE RELEVANT TO ASSESSING THE SAFETY OF OR THE RELEVANT TO INFORMING CONSUMERS OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION -- MANY OF THESE LISTS WE WE THINK ARE APPROPRIATE -- AND TO OUR AUTHORITATIVE UP SOME OF THE LIST HOWEVER ARE ARE WELL JUST RESEARCH LISTS -- THERE -- INGREDIENTS THAT SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO TEST SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY DO IN FACT BECAUSE THOSE AFFECTS. A ONE OF THE WITH THE A LIST THAT -- WE APPRECIATE HAVING BEEN REMOVED -- WAS A A LIST THAT CAME OUT OF DENMARK -- WHICH DOESN'T TO FOLLOW THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S THAT'S BEEN REMOVED RIGHT LET'S TALK A LITTLE WE WE HAVE OTHER LISTS -- IN THERE THAT WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO DISCUSS WHETHER THE TO IN FACT INFORM CONSUMERS. OF INFORMATION WHICH IS -- HELPFUL HELPFUL AND AND SENATOR MITCHELL IF I MAY THE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK -- DELETED THREE OF A LIST IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SB TWO FIFTY EIGHT WHICH IS THE CLEANING PRODUCT LIST. SO WE DO NOT THINK THAT WE ARE ASKING MORE OR LESS BUT JUST ASKING THE INDUSTRY OVER THE OTHER CORRECT. THE I'LL JUST ADD A COUPLE THINGS HIGH LEVEL -- SO SOME OF THE OTHER AMENDMENTS WE'VE REQUESTED INCLUDE A THE DEFINITIONS AROUND WHAT IS A COSMETIC AND TRYING TO A LINE THOSE WITH THE FEDERAL DEFINITIONS AND STATE DEFINITIONS IN THE SHERMAN FOOD AND DRUG BECAUSE MEDIC ACT -- ALSO -- THE IDEA OF WHETHER OVER THE COUNTER COSMETICS ARE OVER -- ARE INCLUDED OR WE'D PREFER THOSE NOT TO BE INCLUDED BECAUSE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THERE ALREADY REGULATED BY THE F. YES. YEAH THIRTY REGULAR BY THE FDA THEY GO THROUGH A DRUG MONOGRAPH PROCESS AGAIN -- TAKE A POLICY TO IT MORE -- TECHNICALLY BUT YES THEY ARE REGULATED DIFFERENTLY -- ALSO THE IDEA OF DISCLOSING TO THE STTE DATABASE VERSUS DISCLOSING ON THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS WEBSITE WE DO BELIEVE A CONSUMER MORE NATURALLY WOULD GO TO APART MANUFACTURES WEBSITE RATHER THAN THE SEA FOR COSMETIC PROGRAM -- SO THAT'S ALSO A REQUEST -- AND THERE I'M SORRY THERE MIGHT BE A COUPLE MORE BUT WE GIVE ME A SENSE. SENATOR LEVEL TWO WOULD YOU MIND WE'RE KIND OF RESPONDING OR NO NOT AT ALL NEEDS TO THE CHAIR IN TERMS OF WHY THOSE PARTICULAR MEMBERS WERE NOT ADDRESSED YES SO IN REGARD TO THE STATE DATABASE VERSES THE COMPANY WEBSITE. WE FEEL THAT A STATE DATA BUT BASS IS A BETTER PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO GO SO THEY CAN LOOK AND GET MAYBE A MORE. REALISTIC -- LOOK AT WHAT IS IN THERE IF YOU'RE REFER TO A COMPANY'S OWN. WEBSITE -- IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR MAYBE A MORE NEUTRAL THIRD PARTY. I WOULD ALSO SAY I THINK THAT WE TOOK. A LOT OF AMENDMENTS IN THIS VERY FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE -- WE DID HAVE A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER MEETING IT WAS THE FIRST I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE THE LAST SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TOGETHER WITH EVERYONE AS EVERYONE HEARD ME SAY. IF EVERYONE WALKS WITH A LITTLE HAPPY OR A LITTLE UNHAPPY WE HAVE DONE OUR JOB. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU AND ADDED SAUCE EIGHT I WANT THANK YOU SIR LEYVA AND FOR FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WE DID HAVE A RIGOROUS DISCUSSION -- THE ACT I APPRECIATE THAT -- THE OPPONENTS STILL HAD SOME MORE THINGS BUT YOU KNOW WE PRESENT WE TALKED ABOUT WHERE TO LIST RESIDES IN CERTAINLY COMPANIES ARE FREE TO PUT ON THEIR OWN WEBSITES -- WHAT BUT I THINK THE IDEA THAT BE IN A CENTRALIZED PLACE WE ALSO TRY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TOXIC AND ALLERGENS RIGHT? SELVES IT NO PEANUTS A LOT PEOPLE ALLERGIC TO THOSE THAT IS MAKING TOXIC BUT PEOPLE MAY NEED TO KNOW IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS SO YOU HAVE TO TO SO WE TRY TO CLARIFY. TOXINS VERSUS OTHER TYPES OF THE STATE MAY HAVE A REACTION FOR SPECIFIC HOURS SOME PEOPLE BUT ISN'T. BY DEFINITION A TOXIN PER SE SO WE TRIED TO CREATE CERTAINLY MANY STEPS IN CLARIFICATION I UNDERSTAND -- THAT THE THAT STAKEHOLDERS STILL HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE PAST NOT JUST FOR THIS BILL BUT HOPEFULLY COME TO SOME. BROADER AGREEMENT ABOUT -- DISCLOSURE AND AND BE SURE TO TRANSPARENCY AND ALSO SAFETY FOR PATIENTS AND CERTAINLY -- APPRECIATE -- YOU CENTER LEYVA FOR FOR A FACILITY THAT CONVERSATION THROUGH THIS BILL -- SO A YES SIR MITCHELL I'M SORRY TO EXPAND THANK YOU -- SOMETHING YOU SAID TRIGGERED FOR ME. IF YOU HAVE THE VOTES TO GET THE BILL OUT I'M GONNA LAY OFF. ONLY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF FULL DISCLOSURE INFORMED CONSENT. ONLY GONNA LAY OFF ON BECAUSE I WANT TO ENCOURAGE BECAUSE I BECAUSE A I THINK ABOUT THE PAST BILLS THAT I HAVE BEEN UP ON I'M PRETTY SURE EVERY TIME. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN QUITE THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE SO I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT. AS I'M GONNA LAY OFF AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE KEPT KIND OF IN THE LOOP ON YOUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS -- AND SO I'M GONNA LAY OFF JUST TO SIGNAL MY DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED I OF COURSE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE IN SUPPORT THE BILL ON THE FLOOR IN AN ON ON GOING BASIS. I WON'T LET YOU LOSE IT TODAY BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S A PART LIKE I SAID IT'S TOO COMPLEX AN ISSUE FOR THE SIMPLY DO THIS TODAY -- SO I'LL SEE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A I WILL VOTE FOR IT TO KEEP THE PROCESS GOING AND THE DIALOGUE GOING -- IF AT ANY POINT. SICKLE TO PROCESS BREAKS DOWN OFF THE ENGAGE WITH BOTH PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS AGAIN THAT COULD HELP INFORM MY DECISION TO GO FORWARD BASIS. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME -- OFF FROM A HEALTH STANDPOINT FOR FRIDAY PERSPECTIVE -- AND SELECTED THE ENGAGED IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO SO ABSOLUTELY CENTER MAKING LIKE YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT SALT TUNE INTO THE VOTE COUNT BUT I'LL LAY OFF ON THE FIRST PASS. CENTER STONE. THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR -- INCHES ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR FOR YOU ALL -- LET'S ASSUME THAT THERE IS NOT GONNA BE ANY FURTHER COOPERATION AND THIS BILL IS GOING TO PASS -- WE'RE DEALING WITH SOME PRODUCTS THAT -- ARE SOLD WORLDWIDE -- MAYBE SOME THAT ARE NOT IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SALES BUT IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SALES -- LET'S TAKE SONOMA AS AN EXAMPLE SHE KNOWS A BRAND -- I'M SURE THEY GUARD THEIR THEIR FRAGRANCE -- FORMULAS VERY CLOSELY TO THE BEST AND IF THEY'RE REQUIRED TO REVEAL THEIR INGREDIENTS WOULD IT BE. SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THEY JUST WILL NOT MARKETING CALIFORNIA AND TAKE THEIR PRODUCTS ELSEWHERE. WELL I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I DON'T REPRESENTATION ALSO I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF DECISION THEY WOULD HAVE BUT I DO THINK IT. IT CUT EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEMSELVES RIGHT IT CERTAINLY EACH COMPANY IF THEY WERE FACED WITH THAT. THERE WOULD BE A MEETING -- CONSIDERING THEIR OPTIONS OKAY AND AND THEN MAYBE TO THE AUTHOR ASSUMING THAT WERE THE CASE AND CHANNEL SAID WE'RE NOT GOING. TO ALLOW OUR PRODUCT TO BE SOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE'RE NOT COULD REVEAL OUR FORMULAS FOR THOSE FRAGRANCES -- WHAT'S TO STOP A ONLINE COMPANY FROM BRING THOSE -- IN THE DON'T HAVE A WAREHOUSE IN CALIFORNIA BUT CAN THEY CAN THEY CAN SELL ONLINE JUST WITH YOUR BILL EFFECTUATE ANYTHING THAT'S BROUGHT IN THROUGH. A SHIPPING APPARATUS. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD US SENATOR STONE AND YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT A COMPANY TELLING US WHAT THEIR FORMULA IS BECAUSE THE WAY YOU MIX INGREDIENTS THAT'S HOW YOU GET A CERTAIN SMELL OR A CERTAIN FLAVOR. ALL THIS BILL IS ASKING BE DONE IS THAT THESE THESE INGREDIENTS THAT COULD BE WELL IN THE INGREDIENT IS LISTED WE'RE NOT TELLING HOW YOU MIX IT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER. SO I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE SUBTLE DIFFERENCE THERE IN LISTING THE INGREDIENTS AND ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FORMULA IS TO MAKE THE PRODUCT -- I THINK IT'S SUBTLE BUT I THINK IT'S THEREBUT NO THE BILL DOES NOT DO ANYTHING -- WITH -- THINGS BEING SHIPPED IN IF I ORDER IF I SITTING IN MY LIVING ROOM AND I ORDER SOMETHING FROM FRANCE OKAY. SO SO I WORRY THAT -- IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS IN ITS PRESENT FORM INGREDIENTS -- IT DOESN'T TAKE. TOO MUCH CHAU EXPERIMENTATION I'M GONNA COMPANY PHARMACY I DO FRAGRANCES ALL TIME WITH MY PRODUCTS AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES A COUPLE TO TRY TO GET CLOSE TO MAYBE SOMETHING IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE -- WITHOUT COPYING OF COURSE -- WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR SPARE TIME SO I'M MORE? I'M WORRYING THAT WE COULD BE HURTING I'M MORE INTO WE COULD BE HEARD IN SOME CALIFORNIA RETAILERS -- IF THIS BILL IS MISCONSTRUED AND AND PASSED IN A FORM THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THEM FROM KERN PRODUCTS SO I DID JERRY MY CONCERNS I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS AS WE ALWAYS DO. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SENATOR STONE OKAY ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IS THERE A MOTION. AS COULD SOMEONE DO A COURTESY MOTION ALL RIGHT I WILL DO THANK YOU CENTER MITCHELL WORKERS THE MOTION -- AND CLOSE. YES -- AND SO US AS FAIRLY BUT YOU YOU MAY CLOSE AND THAT IS MY COMMENT THAT -- I NOW KNOW WHO TO TALK TO I WANT A GIFT FROM MY WIFE'S [inaudible] TO SHEA. PLEASE ENTER A THAT IS QUITE ALRIGHT THANK YOU TO US SENATOR PAN MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO OUR OUR PHARMACY CHEMIST -- MY DAUGHTER'S MARRIED TO A CHEMIST ALSO -- AND I WOULD JUST SAY Y'ALL ARE SMARTER THAN MOST OF US OKAY NOT EVERYONE CAN MIX INGREDIENTS TOGETHER AND MAKE IT TURN INTO SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXPLODE. SO THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT I NEED TO KNOW IT'S ABOUT WANTING TO KNOW WHAT I PUT ON MY BODY IN MY BODY ON MY HAIR. AND I THINK THAT AS A SOCIETY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER I THINK THAT THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND PEOPLE AT AS AN IS EXHIBITED BY COMPANIES NOW THAT. THAT SHOW THESE PRODUCTS AS YOU HEARD FROM SO MANY OF THE SUPPORTERS AND AS SENATOR MITCHELL SAID. THERE ARE SO MANY COMPANIES THAT SAY YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO BUY IT I JUST WANT TO KNOW I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN MY FAVORITE LIP GLOSS THAT I USE EVERY DAY. THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN ANY INGREDIENTS THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY LABELING ALL IT DOES IS SAY TELLS WHAT'S ON THERE SO I AS A CONSUMER CAN GO ON TO THE WEB ON TO THE STATE'S WEBSITE. LOOK AT THE LIST AND GET AN IDEA OF WHAT I WANT TO PUT ON MY BODY OR IN MY BODY THIS IS NOT CHANGED THE WAY COMPANIES TO BUSINESS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LIST THEIR GRADIENTS BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS. WE WILL ABSOLUTELY KEEP WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO ON TEAM LEYVA BUT THIS IS REALLY JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE KNOW AS WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE USING TO CLEAN OUR FLOORS WERE USING TO CLEAN OUR WINDOWS WE KNOW WHAT'S IN THOSE PRODUCTS. EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING ON OUR IN THEIR BODY SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I THANK YOU SIR LEYVA -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IT'S BEEN THAT SECOND IT AS A COURTESY -- MOTION BY SENATOR MITCHELL -- SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HI AND I A STONE. STONE NO DORADO GROVE GROVE KNOWN FURTADO. LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE MITCHELL MONNING [inaudible] RUBIO [inaudible] AUTHORIZES. ONE VOTE ON THIS RIGHT NOW THE TORONTO. ON THE THE CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS ONE SB FRAGRANCE. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR OKAY SHE'S INCOME [inaudible] TORONTO IS [inaudible] I OKAY SO THAT BILLS CURRENTLY THREE TO HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR APPARATE SAVINGS IF YOU'RE THINKING OF RESEARCH ALL RIGHT THANK YOU -- CENTER MORE LIKE WELCOME. SO WE'LL TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN SB. SIX FORTY BUT SIR MORE LACK ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST WANNA. BE SENSITIVE TO ALL THE PEOPLE LEAVING THE ROOM BUT ON THIS BILL MR I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR COUNSEL AND GUIDANCE -- COLLEAGUES SOME PEOPLE JUST. JUST -- CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. AND WE'RE LEAVING THEM TO THE ELEMENTS OUT ON OUR STREETS THAT'S OUR CURRENT SOLUTION AND AND THAT'S INHUMANE. AND IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE. BRING THEM INTO A SUPERVISOR ENVIRONMENT IS ALSO EXPENSIVE. MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS ON OUR STREETS HAVE BEEN A TRAGIC CONSEQUENCE OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE LAND SHERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACT. I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS I DO KNOW THAT SB SIX FORTY PROVIDES AN OBVIOUS ONE AND I'M NOT. THE FIRST TO PROPOSE IT. THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER OUR CURRENT PRIVATE SECTOR HOSPITAL PARTNERS ARE READY FOR A BETTER DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED. AND THE POTENTIAL OF CONSERVATORSHIP LANDING IN THEIR HALLS AND ROOMS. OR NEW FACILITIES DESIGNED FOR THIS MEDICAL NICHE. MISTER CHAIR THANKS FOR HOLDING AN APPRECIATION FOR THIS JUXTAPOSITION. OF DOING WHAT'S RIGHT AND DOING WHAT'S FEASIBLE UNDER THE CURRENT PARADIGM. THIS PAST SUNDAY THE SACRAMENTO BEE. HAD AN EDITORIAL THAT WAS -- SUBMISSION IS PROVIDED BY A NANCY WEAVER TEICHER TO ATTACK. WITH THE TITLE FOR MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS PEOPLE ESCAPING LIFE ON STREETS CAN BE HARD. THE PEACE DETAILS THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING SANDY A ROOM. ON APRIL SECOND KAISER ANNOUNCED CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL SEE MASSIVE SURGE OF HOMES PATIENTS BY PHILIP BREEZE. COMING FROM ORANGE COUNTY. WE HAVE A UNIQUE MODEL IF A HOMELESS PERSON IS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL WE HAVE A NON PROFIT BY THE NAME OF ELIMINATION FOUNDATION WHICH PROVIDES RECUPERATIVE. ROOMS AND BEDS AND THEN THEY LOCATE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND THEN THEY ARE FOLLOWED BY PERMIT HOW TO HOUSING WE HAVE A PIPELINE. BUT THIS PIPELINE PASSED TO BE REPLICATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CONSEQUENTLY THERE REACH THE INTENDED GOAL IS TO DO IT WAS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES I'M PROPOSING A FEW. ITEMS NUMBER ONE THAT. LETTERMAN IS BROKEN EVEN THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE HAS REQUESTED THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR AN AUDIT OF THE ACTS IMPLEMENTATION. TO THAT INSTITUTIONALIZING CERTAIN. EXCUSE ME CERTAIN CLINICAL YOU. AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS IS THE COMPASSIONATE AND APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO PURSUE INVOLUNTARY HOLDS CAN BE THE MOST YOU MAIN SOLUTION. THREE THAT LAURA'S LAW IS BEING ENACTED IN MANY COUNTIES AFTER ORANGE COUNTY IN SB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE BY SENATOR STEINBERG BACK IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN PROVIDED A CREW CRITICAL FUNDING SOURCE AND DIRECTION BUT IT IS ONLY A SEGMENT. AND NOT ALL. OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE USING LARA WALKED. FOR THAT LOWERS LÃ  MAY BE A GOOD STARTING PLATFORM FOR DEALING WITH THE GRAVELY DISABLED AS IT RELATES TO DEALING WITH HIS ME FOR MY THROAT. FOR DISABLED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER. MITCHELL. THING OUT OF ITS ALLERGIES ARE CALLED EVERY MARCH SOMETHING HAPPENS APPEARED. THE FRAGRANCES. OKAY I'LL TRY AND GET BACK ON TRACK THE THAT THAT LOWERS LÃ  MAY BE A GOOD STARTING PLATFORM -- FOR DEALING WITH THE THE COURT SYSTEM AND AND DEALING WITH THOSE THAT ARE. CONSIDERED GRAVELY DISABLED THAT THE MAIL HELP FIGHT THAT THE MIDDLE HEALTH SERVICES ACT WOULD BE A GOOD FUNDING SOURCE TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL NEED. SIX THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME IS ALSO A COMPONENT IN THE HOUSING FOR MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. SEVEN THAT THAT MY JOURNEY IN ADDRESSING A PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. CONFIRM JUST HOW COMPLEX AND FRIED OUR LAWS ARE IN ADDRESSING THE LEAST IN OUR SOCIETY. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL. TO DO SOMETHING BETTER THAN ABANDONING MENTALLY ILL PERSONS WHO ARE UNABLE TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS. TO THE MAINSTREAM OUT ON THE STREETS. SB SIX FORTY IS A STEP IN THE PROCESS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NOW AND I HAVE TO WITNESSES. LISA ASHLEY AND DIANE XIN STOCK. OKAY THANK YOU WELCOME AND THANK CEREMONIAL ACCESS SIX MINUTES TOTAL BETWEEN TO VIEW BACKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- CHAIRMAN PAN AND SENATORS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF SIX FORTY THE MENTAL HEALTH BILL REGARDING -- GRAVELY DISABLED MY NAME IS LISA ASHLEY I'M A PEDIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONER. BUT I'M HERE BECAUSE MY SON IS PAT AS A IS PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC. HE HAS BEEN FOR TEN YEARS. HE'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED FIVE TIMES NOT BECAUSE HE IS VIOLENT NOR IS HE A DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS. BECAUSE HE IS GRAVELY DISABLED. HE HAS ALSO IN ADDITION TO SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND A SOME NOKIA. WHICH MEANS HIS DISEASE DOES NOT ALLOW HIM TO KNOW. THAT HE IS ILL AND IN NEED OF MEDICATION AND TREATMENT. HE IS ON NO MEDICATIONS RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. BUT HE'S ILL. HE HAS BEEN HOMELESS. IN SPITE OF HAVING SSI. A DESIGNATED PAY E.. MEDI CAL. IN ADDITION TO MY PRIVATE INSURANCE. HE REFUSES ALL CARE. THE REASON I TELL YOU THIS IS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE GRAVELY DISABLED NEEDS AS IT IS DEFINED NOW UNDER THE LPS ACT. DOES NOT SERVE INDIVIDUALS LIKE MY SON WHO NEEDS TO BE FIFTY ONE FIFTY TO BE EVALUATED FOR FURTHER CARE AND TREATMENT. I HAVE HAD THE POLICE AT MY HOME A NUMBER OF TIMES TO HAVE HIM TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. ONLY TO HAVE THEM OFTEN SAY TO ME HE DOESN'T MEET CRITERIA. THEY BASE MOST OF THAT ON THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT VIOLENT. AND HE IS NOT -- AND NOT HURTING OTHER PEOPLE OR IN OR HIMSELF. HIS LAST HOSPITALIZATION UNDER GRAVELY DISABLED WAS BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO HIS DISSOLUTION HIS DELUSIONS. HE URINATED IN FRONT OF THE OFFICERS AND THEY FINALLY TOOK HIM INTO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE REMAINED FOR TWO WEEKS. HAND CUFFED INPUT IN THE POLICE CAR. THIS IS NOT RIGHT PEOPLE WHO ARE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN NEUROLOGIC BRAIN DISEASE WHICH CAUSES THEM NOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE ILL AND NEED OF HELP [inaudible] NEED US. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. TO STEP IN AND HELP THEM GET THE HELP THEY NEED. THE LPS NEEDS TO BE REFORMED AND BROUGHT UP TO DATE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE NOW HAVE ABOUT THE GRAVELY DISABLED. DISABLED. FAMILY MEMBERS CAN GET THEIR RELATIVES HELP. IT OUGHT NOT TO TAKE. THE EMOTIONAL PAIN AND TRAUMA FOR FAMILIES TO GO THROUGH TO GET THEIR LOVED ONES HELP. WE NEED THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES TO HELP KEEP THEM IN CARE. AND WE NEED TO HAVE THESE SERVICES ACCOUNTABLE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS DIANE XIN STOCK FROM ROSEVILLE CALIFORNIA -- I'VE BEEN BEFORE YOU BEFORE LAST YEAR ON THIS THE SIMILAR ISSUE -- I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT THAT THE CATALYST FOR THIS BILL ACTUALLY STARTED WITH MYSELF AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MY SON HAD BEEN CONSERVING HAD MET THE CRITERIA FOR GRAVELY DISABLED FOR SEVEN YEARS AND FOR REASONS I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE COUNTY DECIDED TO DROP. THE CONSERVATORSHIP FOUR FOUR IN THOSE FOUR YEARS MY SON SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL AND WAS HOMELESS AND IN AND OUT OF THE JAILS AND HOSPITALS. I BEG THE COUNTY FOR HALL BUT THEY PROVIDED TO ME THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE GRAVELY DISABLED DEFINITION. AND THEY SAID THINGS LIKE IF THAN INDIVIDUALS UNABLE TO PER -- ADEQUATELY CONSUME FOOD AND WATER WHILE ON THE UNIT MEANING IN THE HOSPITAL THEY DIDN'T MEET CRITERIA I ARGUED THAT DOESN'T. TALK TO THE ISSUE OF PROVIDING FOR ONE'S OWN. APPARENTLY STEALING FOOD WHICH MY SON FREQUENTLY DID OR DIGGING IT OUT OF A DUMPSTER IS ACCEPTABLE. THE MENTION TO THE PUBLIC NUDITY OR INADVERTENT EXHIBITIONISM WOULD BECAUSE OF A DEFINING FOR GRAVELY DISABLED. BUT WEARING RIPPED CLOTHES CLOTHING SOAKED IN URINE IS OKAY -- THEY SAID THAT OF FOR PERSON IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SHELTER IN THE COMMUNITY DUE TO BEHAVIORS AND SYMPTOMS OF A MENTAL ILLNESS THEY WOULD THEN MEET. THE CRITERIA BUT LIVING IN A CARDBOARD BOXES OKAY. I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO DO. I KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE LAW SO I TURNED TO MY LEGISLATOR OF MY A LEGISLATOR -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TEN AND TWO YEARS AGO HAS THEN ALLEGE DIRECTOR. BORROWED A BILL SUBMITTED IT WE FELT HE GOT IT WRONG HE SIMPLY ADDED THE WORDS MEDICAL CARE AFTER FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER AND DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE MUCH ELSE TO THE DEFINITION. WE FELT IT WAS WRONG AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TENDED NOT PERCENT BILL FORWARD BUT IT DID GET THE ATTENTION OF LA COUNTY. AND LAST YEAR LA COUNTY THEN -- WORKED WITH FAMILY MEMBERS SANTIAGO AND WE DEVELOPED AB NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IF YOU REMEMBER I WAS HERE LAST YEAR IN SUPPORT OF AB -- NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THAT FAILED BECAUSE EVERYONE GOT REALLY HYPER FOCUSED ON WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL CARE. AND THEY DETERMINED THAT AN INDIVIDUAL HAD TO BE WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF DIE OFF BEFORE THEY WOULD REACH OUT AND HELP THEM OR FIND AN ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS LAW. SO THE BILL DIED THEN -- WE FORGOT AT THAT POINT TO DEFINE WHAT IS FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER. SO. IN MY OPINION I WANT TO SHARE WHY I THINK THAT SB SIX FORTY IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER AB -- NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE FOR STARTERS ADDING ANOTHER QUALIFIER AT THE END OF FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER SUCH AS MEDICAL CARE OR ANY OTHER QUALIFIER YOU MIGHT PUT DOESN'T. AFFECT THE THE CHANGE THAT WE ARE LOOKING -- FOR AB SIX SB SIX FORTY ADDRESSES ADDRESSES WITH MANAGEMENT PATTERSON SHORT INTENDED DECADES AGO WHICH WAS TO ADDRESS IN INDIVIDUALS CAPACITY TO MAKE A DECISION. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LAW IT CLARIFIES IT AND ANYBODY. WHO IS IN SUPPORT? OR IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL IS ESSENTIALLY STATING THAT IT'S OKAY TO CONTINUE TO CRIMINALIZE AND INCARCERATE WORK NOR PEOPLE ON THE STREETS WITH AN ILLNESS WE DON'T DO THAT WITH ANY OTHER ILLNESS OR ANY OTHER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT THE BACK MICROPHONE A NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITIONS BUT SHOULD BE SUPPORT AT THIS POINT ACT. HI MY NAME'S DAVID BAIN AYE WITH MOMMY SACRAMENTO AND I'M SOMEONE WHO LOSES TO BRAIN DISORDERS AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. PROSECUTORS HERE ON BEHALF OF CITY OF SANTA MONICA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.% CASEY NO OTHER. SO IT'S GOING TO MAKE FUN OF ELAINE PAN FOR LONDON -- BUT I MEAN A COUNTY AND WE I MEAN -- CESSATION FOR CHINESE AND TENNIS COMMUNITIES THAT WE SUPPORT THIS FOR YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CRISTINA ONE ELSE AT THE MICROPHONE -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU CAN PLEASE A A MOVED ASIDE SO THEY CAN SET. THEIR EITHER THAT COR SIDE OR THAT SIDE. YEAH THAT'S FINE. JUST NEED TO MAKE ROOM. FOR COUPLE SEATS THERE OKAY. OKAY SO AT THE WENT OVER A LITTLE SO GIVE ELEVEN EXTRA TIME IF YOU NEED IT BUT IF YOU DON'T NEED IT DID I HAVE TO TAKE IT. THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS WE'VE BEEN OPPOSED AND AND VARIOUS EFFORTS THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND CONSERVATORSHIP WITHOUT ASSURING THAT THERE ARE SERVICES AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING TECH COMPANY -- THOSE EXPANDED CONSERVATORSHIP. THIS BILL WAS REALLY I THINK IS PREMISED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED LACKS CLARITY. BUT BUT WHAT IT DOES IS SUBSTITUTES A NUMBER OF TERMS -- IN THERE WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED -- THAT I THINK ARE. ACTUALLY OVERLY BROAD AND MORE CONFUSING TO THOSE WHO ON THE STREET WHO WOULD BE LOOKING AT ATTEMPTING TO APPLY THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED. SO YOU HAVE -- A NUMBER IN TERMS IN THERE FOR EXAMPLE IN CAPABLE OF MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS -- SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC DEGRADATION -- EVEN ONE THAT'S MISMANAGEMENT OF HIS OR HER ESSENTIAL NEEDS THE COULD RESULT IN BODILY HARM -- ALL I THINK WHICH ARE OVERLY BROAD THIS IS A DEFINITION THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM ANOTHER STATE THE IMPORTANT POINT I THINK IS. IT WITHIN LPS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S A DECADES OLD -- STATUTE WE'VE DEALT WITH THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED FOR MANY MANY YEARS IT'S BEEN INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS OVER AND OVER IT'S INTERPRETED BY -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SIMPLY SUBSTITUTING ANOTHER DEFINITION ANOTHER SET OF WORDS DOESN'T DO WHAT I THINK -- THE THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL WOULD HOPE THAT IT WOULD WOULD DO -- SO WE WOULD SGGEST. THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT THE LPS IS REALLY A COMPLEX BALLOTS IT'S A COMPLEX BALANCE TO INSURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS -- FROM DANGER TO THEMSELVES IN DANGER TO OTHERS WHILE-RESPECTING THE AUTONOMY AND RIGHTS OF OF INDIVIDUALS NOT TO BE HELD AGAINST -- AGAINST THEIR WILL AND IT'S IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT JUST ONE LITTLE PIECE OF LPS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE ENTIRE BREADTH OF THIS STATUTE. AND THE BALANCE THAT IT HAS TO MAKE IN PROTECTING RIGHTS AGAINST PROTECTING -- INDIVIDUALS. SO FOR THAT REASON. MISTER CHAIR WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL UNDER NO VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN FLORI ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE'RE IN OPPOSITION FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS THAT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IS AND IN ADDITION WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT. A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE SEEN WITH CONSERVATORSHIP SIR DUE TO THE LACK OF UPSTREAM SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED WE HAVE CONTINUED FAILINGS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING -- CONTINUED FAILINGS TO PROVIDE THE FULL SENSE OF WRAPAROUND SERVICES AN INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT TO INDIVIDUALS NEED TO GET THEM BACK OFF THE STREET AND INTO APPROPRIATE HOUSING. THANK YOU. YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION CHECK BACK FOR HIS RETURN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH US HERE YOU CALIFORNIA I JUST LIKE TO LINE MY COMMENTS I MADE BY DRC THANK YOU [inaudible] HE RESEARCHER MEMBERS ALICE HAWTHORNE WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO OUR MEMBERS -- AND WE THINK THE MEMBER FOR BRINGING IT FOR TO HAVE IT ON OUR CONCERN IS THAT -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE BROADER REFORMS TO THE LPS ACT BEFORE MAKING A CHANGE LIKE THIS BUT IS THE TOP PRIORITY FOR MEMBERS TO ADDRESS -- THIS ISSUE WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE SENATOR GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. SEEN ON US AT THE MICROPHONE A QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER MITCHELL. IS THE HEAD A MORE LOT I WAS IN COMMITTEE OUT LAST YEAR WHEN WE DEBATED AND AGREED ON SOME AMENDMENTS ON AB NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION THAT THAT LOOKS AND CONTINUED WORK WOULD BE DONE -- I UNDERSTAND THAT BILL WAS NOT AMENDED IN THE ADDITIONAL COMMITTEES IT WAS HEARD IN AND THEN IT. IT DIED IN AN ACTIVE FILE -- YOU KNOW I I WOULD JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT I HAVE TO WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT DISAGREE WITH ONE COMMENT YOU MAY. AND THAT'S THE NOTION THAT LANCEMENT PATRICK SHORT ACT IS BROKEN. AND I THINK THAT THAT WHILE WE DO HAVE A OVERWHELMING -- ISSUE IMPACTING ALL OF US ACROSS THE STATE. ON INTO REPRESENTED BY. THE TWO WOMEN HERE WHO TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS. BUT TO DENY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ACTED AS FIFTY PLUS YEAR NOW HISTORY RECOGNIZING THE CULTURE WITHIN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO CAN SAY THAT IT'S BROKEN -- SHOULD IT. REQUIRE -- AID A NEW LOOK. PERHAPS -- I THINK I AM CONCERNED ABOUT A PIECEMEAL APPROACH. TO RE OPENING -- AT ISSUE IS SENSITIVE AS HOW WE ALLOW -- FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS FOR THOSE WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES AVAIL ILLNESS I WOULD ALSO CHALLENGE THE OPPOSITION AS I DID LAST YEAR -- THAT WE CAN'T DIGGER HILLS IN THE SAND -- BASED ON THAT FIFTY YEAR AGO HISTORY AND MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACT'S MEANS THAT WE OPEN THE FLOOD DOORS AND WE TRAVEL BACK IN TIME I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE THERE EITHER. BUT THE YEARS I'VE SPENT ON SUB ONE IN SUB -- THREE IN DEALING WITH -- FROM A FINANCE PERSPECTIVE WAYS IN WHICH WE SUPPORT -- THE SEVERELY DISABLED AND THOSE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS THROUGH THE LANCEMENT PICTURE SHORT ACT YOU KNOW SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THAT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE AS YOU SAID. BECAUSE THE DEALER AUDIT HAS BEEN COMMISSIONED. THAT WE WAIT AND SEE. I WANT TO BE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE AUDIT AND FALLS IF IT PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK MORE BROADLY AT THE ACT -- BRINGING ALL OF THE VESTED INTERESTS TO THE TABLE AND HAVING A FAIR TWENTY NINETEEN RELEVANT CONVERSATION. NOT TO SUGGEST THAT WE OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME BUT ALSO TO ACKNOWLEDGE VERY REAL ISSUES WE ARE CONFRONTING. IN OUR OWN HOMES AND COMMUNITIES AND STREETS TODAY. SO FOR ME TODAY WILL BE A NO -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE J.LACK OF BEEN COMMISSION AN AUDIT IS FORTHCOMING WE ARE IN THE FIRST CALENDAR YEAR FOR TWO YEAR SESSION. I THINK THAT THERE IS TIME TO SEE WHAT THE I'D IT WILL BRING FORWARD AND THIS TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WILL HAVE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP UP AND TAKE ACTION ACCORDINGLY. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU A CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON I WANT TO THANK SENATOR MITCHELL. FOR HER COMMENTS IN IN SATAN AISLEYNE MONEY VIEWS SIMILARLY BUT I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR THE FAMILIES WHO ARE HERE TODAY -- I KNOW THE PLIGHT OF FAMILIES DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS -- I KNOW THE FRUSTRATION OF A SYSTEM THAT IS TOO OFTEN ON RESPONSE OVER UNABLE TO RESPOND OR RESPOND IN THE WRONG WAY BY. CRIMINALIZING CONDUCT. THAT IS THE RESULT OF THE ILLNESS -- SO I AM ALSO GOING TO CAST A NOBLE TODAY BUT I THINK THE THE LIFELINE HERE THE HOPE IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY THOROUGH -- LEGISLATIVE AUDITOR'S REPORT -- THAT WILL INFORM HOW WE MIGHT BEST GO FORWARD IN CRAFTING REMEDIES -- FOR FAMILIES FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR COMMUNITIES. I WANT TO THINK THOSE WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS IN WESTERN CENTER YES -- FOR FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THESE EFFORTS TO AND I I JUST WANT THE FAMILIES TO KNOW THAT. THE NO VOTE TODAY IS NOT. THE VOTE IN OPPOSITION TO THE CHALLENGE THE PLATE IN THE PAIN AND SUFFERING IN ENDING IT SHARED BY EVERYBODY. UP HERE ON THIS DÃ­AS IN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU SENATOR. TO FINDING THE PATHWAY THAT THEY CAN WORK SELF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR ASA. YES I ALSO WANT TO THANK CENTER -- MITCHELL FOR FRAME IN THIS. IN THE MOST POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE WAY POSSIBLE I WOULD ADD AND I'M NOT HERE THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT. OTHERS HAVE ARE. OR HAVE BEEN BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IN THE SHORT TIME I'VE BEEN HERE THERE'S ENORMOUS CONCERN AND COMMITMENT TO PUT RE START PUTTING THE RESOURCES. THAT ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDED TO ADDRESS A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES THAT LEAD -- PEOPLE. TO END UP ON THE STREET AND NOT KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES NOT ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES SO. I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS FAR AS WHEN WE GO WE GO FORWARD BUT I TO COMMIT. TO PUSHING FOR RESOLUTION WHICH IS DUE. TO ARE WE PROVIDING. THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED AND IF WE'RE NOT THERE WE'VE GOT TO PUT MUCH MUCH MORE THAN THAT SO I I ALSO THANK YOU. AND FAMILIES FOR BEING HERE TODAY [inaudible] SENATE MITCHELL. THANK YOU TO SOMETHING MY COLLEAGUES TO THE TRIGGERED ME -- YOU KNOW. AND THEN WE HAVE TO CHECK OURSELVES SOMEONE MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE CONSTRUCTION PERMIT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH WITH SUPPORT SERVICES. AND I COME FROM THE CITY AND COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT IS FIGHTING TO HAVE THEM BUILT. AND FACE OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTS IT IN THEIR BACKYARD SO IT'S EASY TO SIT HERE TO COMMITTEE AND SAY WE HAVE TO BRING SERVICES FOR IT UNTIL WE TALK ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO LOCATE THEM. HEY AND WHO'S GONNA PAY FORM AND SO WE ARE STEPPING FORWARD BETTER AND BETTER CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE PASS INITIATIVES TO TO TO COULDN'T BUILD. AND VIENNA. OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS TALK ABOUT WHERE IT SHOULD BE SOLD. IF WE WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION OF BEYONCE AND HAVE A COMPLETE CONVERSATION. ON THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS IN FRANCE WHO NEED-IT. THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNDING AND WHERE THEY WILL BE LOCATED [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN THE COMMENTS -- SAUCER MARKET APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING. INTO THIS ISSUE WHICH OF COURSE HAS BEEN NOW WE'VE BEEN. TALKING ABOUT A LOT AND AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY HEARING FROM PEOPLE AND I KNOW YOU'VE WE'VE JUST TALKED VERY BRIEFLY THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT QUITE THERE YET AND BUT AT THAT AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE OPTION TO WORK ON IT SO I I GUESS YOU CAN COMMENT. LATER ABOUT MAYBE HOLDING THIS AND MAKE YOUR TO YOUR BILL. I DO JUST WANT IT -- SAY TO THE PROPONENTS -- YELLED AS A PHYSICIAN WHO TAKES CARE OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES -- NETWORKS PARENTS WHO FACED -- SOME THE SAME STORIES AND I THINK THAT ON ONE LEVEL YES WE NEED MORE SUPPORT SERVICES YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT CONSUMERS AND THE CONSERVATIVES IN A HOUSING ETCETERA -- BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT AND I KNOW WE HAVE TO STRIKE A VERY CAREFUL BALANCE -- THAT EVEN SOMETIMES WHEN THE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IF THE PERSON ISN'T WILLING TO PARTAKE OF IT. WHAT WE DO AND AGAIN WE WANT TO RESPECT AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WE DON'T TAKE PEOPLE'S ECONOMY AWAY? YOU KNOW. UP IN SOME SENSES WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR THÃ NH E. WHEN YOU'RE DISEASE DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW YOU TO SELECTIVELY EXERCISES THAT INTEL'S YOU'RE TREATED THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY EXERCISE AUTONOMY RIGHT. AND WE ARE WITH THE VERY CAREFUL HOW YOU DO THAT'S I'M VERY SENSITIVE THAT SO AND I THINK THAT WHAT'S IN THE BILL CURRENTLY IS TOO BROAD OKAY BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME WORK THAT COULD BE DONE AND IT DOES NEED TO ALSO LOOP BACK INTO. MORE RESOURCES RIGHT AND DIE SIR SHARE CENTER MITCHELL'S EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I'VE. SUCCEEDED HER ON BUDGETS OF THREE AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT NOW WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES AND SO FOR THAT OUR BUDGET SO FORTH. BUT BY SO WE DO NEED TO TACKLE THAT. BUT I ALSO THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT AS WELL THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT FIGURE OUT DO WE MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS -- TO TO TO BE SURE THAT WE STILL PROTECT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS. RIGHT THAT'S AND BUT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THOSE RIGHTS AND AT A TIME TO ME. YOU NEED TO DATE THEY NEED TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE. THEY HAVE THE JUDGMENT DAY THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT THAT THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT PREVENT THEM FROM DOING THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M HEARING FROM THE PROPONENTS THAT THERE'S FRUSTRATION ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD PREVIOUSLY NO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE LARA'S LAW AND PEOPLE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THAT OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. SO I'M HOPING SIR MOORLACH -- AND YOU COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT YOUR DECISION IS TODAY -- THAT CERTAINLY. THE ONLY LAST YEAR FROM THE AUDIT WE ALSO WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN TRY. TO GIVEN TOGETHER AND SEE WHETHER WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT HOW WE SOLVE. THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT I HEAR FRUSTRATION COMING FROM THE THE THE PEOPLE PRESENTING TODAY AND THE OTHER SUPPORTERS AS WELL -- SO I MEAN I THINK PEOPLE ARE ON BOTH SIDES OF EXPRESS TREMENDOUS GOOD WILL AND DESIRE TO HELP -- CAN WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO LAND THAT BALANCE THERE AND AND AND AND AND AND SLIGHTLY. HOPEFULLY BETTER PLACE PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT THE CURRENT PLACES VIEWS BECAUSE WE ARE YET BUT I I BUT I WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THEIR FAMILIES ARE FRUSTRATED EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ABLE THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO HELP SELL -- WITH THAT -- SIR MORE LIKE WHICH USE LIKE. TO THOSE ARE TELL US WHAT YOU WISH TO DO WITH YOUR BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR SAGE COUNSEL LIGHT THAT'S WHAT I ASKED FOR YOU GAVE IT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR. MITCHELL AS WELL -- AS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE. THIS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE HOMELESS ISSUE. SINCE I BECAME A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND EVEN BEFORE THAN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE POPULATION AROUND THE CITY CENTER IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND IT'S COMPLEX [inaudible] AND WHY I DID THIS BILL IT WAS A RESULT OF A OF A RADIO INTERVIEW. AND IT WAS -- DR DREW. I'VE KBC OUT OF LA AND HE SAID OUT. THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES WHAT HE WE DOING WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE. ON OUR STREETS AND HE'S A I THINK A TRAINED PSYCHIATRIST AND HE SAID WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS IMPROVE -- THIS DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED SO THAT'S HOW THIS LITTLE CHAPTER STARTED. BUT IT OVER WE NEED SUPPORT SERVICES THE OPPOSITION IS CORRECT. I THIS FRIDAY LAST FRIDAY I WAS. TOURING FOR THREE HOURS OF FACILITY. IN ORANGE COUNTY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. WE'VE ALREADY GOT -- IN THE CITY OF ORANGE A SITE THAT WE FOUND. AT CEDAR MITCHELL KNOWS IS A DIFFICULT BUT WE WE CALL IT BE WELL IN OB AS SERVICING -- THE MENTALLY ILL AND SO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING IN OUR REGION AND SO BECAUSE I WAS INVOLVED WITH PROPOSITION TWO AND CENTER DELEON AND I GOT IT ON THE BALLOT. YOU KNOW BY THE JOINT AUTHORS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET SEE WE ARE OUR CONCERN BUT THAT'S A A FUNDING SOURCE SO SIGNATURE TODAY. I'D LIKE TO REQUEST NO MOTION I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS A TO YOUR BILL [inaudible] AND A AND AND I I NEED TO WORK ON NOT YOUR AMENDMENTS THAT YOU PROPOSE BUT AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE RESOURCES. TO GET SOMETHING IN PLACE AND AND MAYBE STROLL MODEL MAY BE ORANGE COUNTY OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS WANT TO COMPASSIONATE SOLUTION -- TO A SEGMENT OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION I WAS BORN ON DECEMBER TWENTY FIRST AND I'VE ALWAYS COMPLAIN THAT IT WAS THE SHORTEST DAY. BUT THE HOMES COMMUNITY OF SAID IT'S THE LONGEST NIGHT. AND THEY MAY DECEMBER TWENTY ONE THE DAY WE MEMORIALIZE. THE HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT HAVE PASSED ON OUR STREETS IN AN ORANGE COUNTY IT'S BEEN TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE A YEAR. YEAH I'D LIKE TO REDUCE THAT STATISTIC. BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT CANNOT MANAGE THEMSELVES WHO CANNOT. TAKE CARE OF THEIRSELVES. YOU KNOW WE WE'VE GOT A STEP UP BECAUSE THIS IS NOT MEDIEVAL TIMES THIS IS. TWENTY NINETEEN AND I I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH. YOU'RE ALLOWED ME TO PRESENT THE BILL AND AND FOR GIVING ME THE GRACE TO MAKE IT TO YOUR BILL I THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO AT THE AUTHOR'S REQUEST WE WILL HOLD THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. FOR HOLDING THE BILL COMMITTEE THAT. OKAY -- NEXT UP THEN -- SIR DORADO. SO DO YOU -- IT MIGHT TAKE UP BECAUSE I KNOW YOU ALSO PRESENTS ARE JACKSON'S BILL DUMA'S SHOULD WE TAKE IT UP AND FILE ORDER THAN. OKAY SO THEN WE'LL -- WE'RE GONNA HEAR ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR BY CENTER JACKSON BEING PRESENTED BY SENATOR ALSO [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON [inaudible] MISTER CHAIR. BUT YOU HAVE TO DO MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOR TWO FOR ON BEHALF OF SENATOR JACKSON WHO COULD NOT. BE HERE TODAY. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS ON THE BILL LET YOU KNOW. THAT SENATOR JACKSON HAS AGREED TO TAKE THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT SUGGESTED ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS. SB FOUR TWO FOUR WOULD ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE. TOBACCO RELATED WASTE REDUCTION PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGH A TWO PRONGED APPROACH FIRST THE BILL BANS THE SALE OF SINGLE USE FILTERS. AND PLASTIC DEVICES USED WITH TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND IT BANS THE SALE OF SINGLE USE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AND VAPORIZER DEVICES. SECOND THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT ALL MULTI USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS BE ORDINARILY RECYCLABLE. BY EITHER A LOCAL OR STATE RECYCLING PROGRAM OR IF A COMPONENT IS NOT ORDINARILY RECYCLABLE. THEN THE BILL REQUIRES THE MANUFACTURER OF THE PRODUCT TO SET UP EITHER COLLECTION OR MAIL TAKE BACK PROGRAM FOR THAT COMPONENT. TOBACCO PRODUCT WASTE IS AMONG THE MOST PROPELLANT AND VEXING PROBLEMS FACED BY MUNICIPAL AGENCIES. IN THEIR EFFORTS TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES CLEAN AND OUR ENVIRONMENT PROTECTED. CLEANING UP THIS WAYS COST MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS ANNUALLY. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DOCTOR JOE AND BRASH. SPECIAL PROJECTS MANAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS OF THIS BILL. THANK. THANK YOU THIS IS A SPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR PAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SIGN MY NAME IS DOCTOR JOANNE BRASH. I'M WITH THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL A NON PROFIT ADVOCATING FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY. I ALSO LECTURE AT UC DAVIS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TEXTILES COVERING TOPICS OF FIBER AND POLYMER CHEMISTRY. I'M HERE TODAY AS A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. FOR TWO FOR TOBACCO PRODUCT REYES HAS CAUSED LONG TERM DAMAGE TO OUR ECOSYSTEMS. AND OUR COMMUNITIES. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE BEARING THE COST BURDEN TO REMOVE TOBACCO WASTE FROM THE ENVIRONMENT BUT CANNOT REMOVE THE CHEMICALS AND MICRO PLASTICS LEACHING INTO THE WATER. KILLING THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENDANGERING OUR COMMUNITIES. REVIEWED RESEARCH INDICATES RISING ALONG. AND I DO HAVE A DELAY CARCINOMAS. AS SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ACETATE FILTERS. THE ACETATE FILTERS ALTER THE TOBACCO COMBUSTION INCREASING SMOKE TOXICANTS AS CITED IN THE JOURNAL OF NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE JUST IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CURRENTLY THERE IS INSUFFICIENT END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT IN PLACE FOR PROPER HANDLING OF TOBACCO WASTE. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE SAN FRANCISCO SPENT NEARLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON CIGARETTE BUT CLEAN UP ALONE. IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THE DOWNTOWN STREET TEAM -- CLEANED UP. A TWO MILE STRETCH OF THE UNINCORPORATED COUNTY WHICH IS ALREADY CLEANED THREE TIMES A WEEK AND THEY STILL FOUND OVER THOUSAND CIGARETTE BUT HARM. A CALL FOR SIGNIFICANTLY GOING TO INCREASE. AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PHASE IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF CAPTURE DEVICES TO MEET THE TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD REQUIREMENTS AS SET BY THE STATE WATER BOARD. BOARDS. THIS BILL BANS THE SALE OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC IN TOBACCO PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT NEED TO STATE AND LOCAL RECYCLING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES TO BE REUSABLE. AND THE PRODUCERS TO PROVIDE A TAKE BACK PROGRAM FOR PROPER END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT WE ASKED PRODUCERS TO TAKE THEIR FAIR SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE HARD TO MANAGE PRODUCTS. AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALONE CANNOT HANDLE THE COST BURDEN OF TOXIC TOBACCO WASTE. POSING SIGNIFICANT RISK TO HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY. NO SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RESTRICTION SHELTER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS YOU'RE TO COUNSEL INSTRUCTS FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS RUNNING AS CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. HELLO KILLER ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THREE SEPARATE VERGE ON BEHALF OF HEAL THE BAY SURFRIDER SEVENTH GENERATION ADVISORS AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. DINNER BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SEEN NO OTHER APPS BUT THE MICROPHONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CENA WITH THIS IS OPPOSITION QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER LEYVA SEEN NO THE QUESTION SIR THANK YOU SENATOR OTHER FOR PRESENTING THIS ON BEHALF OF CENTER JACKSON APPRECIATE THAT WE NEED TO TRY TO REDUCE THE WASTE THAT'S COMING FROM THE SWITCHING WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. EXCELLENT SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IT'S BEEN MOTION BY AT CENTER LEYVA SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HI. I STONE. STONE NOW DORADO. HI ROSE -- I'D GROWTH HER TADO. LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MONNING MONNING I SO CURRENTLY THE VOTE IS -- FIVE TO ONE THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET THE BILL OUT THE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT. MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER -- NINE SP FOUR FIFTY EIGHT BY CENTER ALSO. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AS OUR BUT WITNESSES -- CAN COME UP. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF ALSO FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL -- I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE -- COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT. THAT KEEPS THE BAN OF CORPORATE FILE CLERK PURIFY US. IN EFFECT UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION AND THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. DETERMINED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE. THAT THE CONTROL MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. FOR CHLORPYRIFOS WILL NOT RESULT IN NEAR DEVELOPMENTAL HARM TO CHILDREN AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CONSUMPTION OF FOOD OR WATER. THIS BILL IS VITAL TO PROTECTING ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA CHILDREN FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE AND EVERY RACE AND ETHNICITY. EXPOSURE TO CHLORPYRIFOS BEGINS IN THE WOMB AND CONTINUES WHEN KIDS COSUME THE FRUITS NUTS AND VEGETABLES. THAT WE AS PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS ENCOURAGE THEM TO EAT. HERE IS WHAT THE RECOGNIZE EXPERTS CONCLUDE IS IRREFUTABLE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ABOUT THE NEARLY ONE MILLION POUNDS OF CHLORPYRIFOS APPLIED EACH YEAR ON CALIFORNIA CROPS. AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CONCLUDES. THERE IS A WEALTH OF EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF CHLORPYRIFOS EXPOSURE TO DEVELOPING FETUSES INFANTS CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN. THE RISK TO INVENT AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT IS UNAMBIGUOUS. AT LEAST FOUR LANDMARK STUDIES PROVIDE THE EVIDENCE THAT THIS AGREEMENT DAMAGES. INGREDIENT DAMAGES THE BRAINS OF FETUSES BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN. YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU DOCUMENTATION ON EACH OF THESE EACH OF THEM. SCIENTISTS IN ALL FOUR STUDIES EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPOSURE. GIORDANO PHOSPHATE PESTICIDES SUCH AS CLERK. PREPARE FOR US COR PAIR FOR US DURING PREGNANCY AND THE SUBSEQUENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OF EXPOSED CHILDREN. AS A RESULT OF STUDIES RELATING TO HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS AND COMMON RESIDENTIAL USE THE MAKER OF RAID. S. C. JOHNSON SONS WAS FORCED TO REMOVE COR PARA FOSS FROM ITS PRODUCT. RAID STILL KILLS IN SEX. IT JUST DOES SO WITHOUT THE INGREDIENT THE DAMAGES THE BRAINS OF FETUSES INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. IN THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDY SCIENTISTS AND RULED PREGNANT WOMEN IN NEW YORK CITY WERE EXPOSED IN THEIR HOMES. THEY MEASURED CHLORPYRIFOS IN UNDER UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD. THEY FOUND EXPOSURE BECAUSE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND ATTENTION AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN THEIR CHILDREN AT THREE YEARS. REDUCTION IN AYE CUES AND WORKING MEMORY AT SEVEN YEARS. AND EVEN STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE BRAIN AND LATE CHILDHOOD. IN THE MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE STUDY ALSO IN NEW YORK CITY RESEARCHERS AND ROL PREGNANT WOMEN AND REPORTED EXPOSURE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASES IN THEIR KIDS MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AT ONE YEAR OF AGE. THE OTHER TWO STUDIES SHOW AGRICULTURAL USE OF THIS INGREDIENT DAMAGES THE BRAINS OF FETUSES BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN. IN THE UC BERKELEY STUDY SCIENTISTS AND ROLL PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE SALINAS VALLEY AND FOUND EXPOSURE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TENSION PROBLEMS. AND ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER AMONG THE CHILDREN AT FIVE YEARS. PLUS REDUCTIONS I CAN AYE CUES AND WORKING MEMORY. THE UC DAVIS STUDY SHOWS RESEARCHERS COMPARED CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. SPECTRUM DISORDER TO SIMILAR CHILDREN WITHOUT THE DISORDER. THEY FOUND MOTHERS WHO HAD CHILDREN WITH THE DISORDER WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LIVED IN NEAR FEELS WERE CLEAR POOR FOSS WAS APPLIED. BASED ON PESTICIDE APPLICATION. UP MAINTAINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION THE U. S. EPA UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA RECOGNIZED THE IRREFUTABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. INCLUDING THE CLEAR C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt;</u> CONCLUSIONS OF ITS OWN SCIENTISTS. BY PROVIDING BY PROPOSING TO BAN KARPOV [inaudible] CLUB ROUGH. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. WHEN I SAY CLORE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EPA ADMINISTRATOR SCOTT PRUETT CONTRADICTED THE OVERWHELMING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND THE CLEAR CONCLUSIONS OF THE EPA'S OWN SCIENTISTS. BY REFUSING TO FINALIZE THAT BAN IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEREFORE THE ONLY WAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN RESPECT THEIR REPEATABLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS INGREDIENT IS BY ENACTING SB. FOUR FIFTY EIGHT THIS YEAR COLLEAGUES WE IN THE LEGISLATURE ARE CONSIDERING GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NUISANCE PLAN FOR EXPANDING EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. WHEN OUR GOVERNOR TALKS ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT HE MAKES A CONVINCING CASE FOR THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF A CHILD'S BRAIN? SB FOUR FIVE EIGHT WILL AND CALIFORNIA'S TOLERANCE OF THE WIDESPREAD USE OF AN INGREDIENT THAT DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE. YOU HAVE YOUR IN YOUR PACKETS TODAY A LETTER FROM THIRTY NINE SCIENTISTS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. THESE EXPERTS TELL US THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE CONTINUED USE OF COLOR. CLARK. ISRAEL HARMFUL TO BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. THEY ALSO TELL IS THAT IN MANY OF THE STUDIES THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A THRESHOLD OR SAFE LEVEL OF EXPLODED EXPOSURE. WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY OUR DOCTOR IRVINE HURTS BUT G. P. G. ALREADY BE CHAU. GOOD CLOSE ENOUGH PRESS IS PROFESSOR AND VICE CHAIR FOR RESEARCH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES AT UC DAVIS. TYLER SMITH STAFF SCIENTIST AT JUSTICE AND GREG LAURIE STAFF ATTORNEY AT EARTH JUSTICE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO I WILL MAKE NOTE THAT -- WE ALLOW SIX MINUTES -- I'LL MAKE A LITTLE SIGNAL IT TOO AND FOR WITH MY HANDS BUT YOU YOU FIGURE OUT BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU WHOEVER'S LAST MAY FIND THEMSELVES WITH VERY LITTLE TIME IF THE OTHER. TWO PEOPLE AHEAD DON'T KEEP THAT IN MIND SO -- WELCOME AND LOOK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. ACTUALLY YOU CAN JUST YEAH YOU HAVE THE MICROPHONE IN FRONT OF FIVE YOU THERE OKAY THANK YOU. YEAH. OKAY. I'M OVER HER TEACHER. TO PREVENT. WE KNOW EACH OTHER A PROFESSOR IN AT UC DAVIS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR ACTUALLY. PRETTY MUCH LAYING OUT THE SCIENCE -- AS IT IS AND YOU KNOW JUST MAYBE I'LL ADD A FEW POINTS HERE ONE IS THAT THE ORGANIC PHOSPHATE PESTICIDES ACTUALLY THEY WERE ORIGINALLY BEING DEVELOPED -- AS NERVE AGENTS -- THEY WERE NEVER FORTUNATELY EVER USE FOR THAT BUT WERE LATER ADAPTED THEN TO BE USES PESTICIDES AND THEY KILL. INSECTS AND SPIDERS BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT THEY DO NOW AT VERY HIGH LEVELS THEY CAN BE ACUTELY TOXIC AND CAN RESULT IN CONVULSIONS AND AND EVEN. DEATH WHEN A VERY HIGH LEVEL IS TAKEN AND AS POLLS WHICH IS REALLY POISONOUS. BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT TODAY'S THE LOW LEVEL EXPOSURES. THAT OCCUR THROUGH READING THE AIR UP IF YOU LIVE IN AN AGRICULTURAL AREA SAY WITHIN A MILE OR SO -- WHERE APPLICATIONS ARE BEING -- WHERE CLICK HERE FOR US IS BEING A AND OTHER ORGAN APOSTATES ARE BEING APPLIED YOUR BREATHING AIR YOU'RE TAKING AND THOSE PESTICIDES AND THERE ARE -- THERE'S VERY STRONG STUDIES SHOWING THAT THAT DRIFT CORRESPONDS VERY CLOSELY WITH THE APPLICATIONS AND BEEN MADE BASED ON DEEP YARD -- DATA. AND OF COURSE THE OTHER WAY AS LAID OUT BY THE SENATOR IS THROUGH RESIDUES THERE ON FOOD IN THERE ON ON PARTICULARLY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SO THAT AFFECTS EVERYBODY -- BY NOW THERE ARE OVER THREE DOZEN STUDIES. THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED THIS LINK BETWEEN PRENATAL EXPOSURE -- OVERWHELMINGLY HAVE. SHOWN THAT THE OUTCOMES OF OF LOWER I. Q. AND IMPAIRMENTS IN. MEMORY AND LEARNING AS WELL AS SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER -- OF ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER. ARE -- ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PRENATAL EXPOSURE AND THAT THESE OUTCOMES OCCUR. STARTING SHORTLY AFTER BIRTH AND ALL THE WAY INTO ADOLESCENCE -- THE THIS REFLECTS ALL ALTERATIONS IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. AND IN FACT A CORE PROPOSES THE MOST COMMON OF THESE ORGAN OF PHOSPHATES BUT NO STUDY HAS IDENTIFIED A LEVEL BELOW WHICH WE CAN SCAN SO THERE IT SAFE. THE VERY LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THERE IS AN ABUNDANT ANIMAL EXPERIMENTAL LIVE THE LITERATURE -- MUCH OF WHICH WAS DONE BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES EARLY TWO THOUSANDS IT ALSO SHOWED. IMPAIRMENTS IN LEARNING AND MEMORY AND BEHAVIORS THE SAME SYMPTOMS THAT WE SEE IN HUMAN BEINGS -- WE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS OF EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH HAS NOW SHOWN -- SO I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS QUITE COMPELLING. AND AS SENATORS -- YOU CAN REALLY MOVE FORWARD HOW WE REGULATE A CHEMICAL POLICY HERE -- AND REALLY MAKE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROTECTING CHILDREN'S BRAINS GOOD AFTERNOON [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. GERMAN DOCTOR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY MY NAME IS TYLER SMITH I'M A STAFF SCIENTIST AT EARTH JUSTICE WE ARE THE NATION'S LARGEST NONPROFIT ENVIRONMENTAL LAW ORGANIZATION. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SENATE BILL FOUR FIVE EIGHT AND WE JOINED THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AS WELL AS THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. HAS CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN U. S. EPA CONCLUDED THAT USING CORPORA FALSE ON FOOD DOES NOT MEET THE FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARD. OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF NO HARM. AND THE AGENCY PROPOSED A BAN THAT WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED NEARLY ALL USES OF THIS PESTICIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN USEPA SCIENTISTS REVIEWED THE STUDY CITED BY THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL AND EXAMINE THE HUNDREDS OF WAYS THE CORPORATE COST MAY BE USED UNDER CURRENT LAW. THEY FOUND THAT ALL OF THESE USES. RESULT IN UNSAFE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE. WHEN HANDLERS FOLLOW ALL OF THE DIRECTIONS ON PESTICIDE LABELS AND EVEN WHEN THE WHERE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT? THEY ALSO FOUND THAT THE CONTINUED USE OF CORPORATE FALLS ON FOOD HARM TO THOSE WHO EAT THE FOOD. USES ON FOOD EXPOSE CHILDREN ONE TO TWO YEARS OF AGE TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY TIMES WHAT US EPA CONSIDERS ACCEPTABLE. MOREOVER THE AGENCY CONCLUDED THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF QUICKER ACOSTA DRINKING WATER. AND YET AN EARLY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD NOT FINALIZED THE PROPOSED BAN. THE ADMINISTRATION DISREGARDED THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND LET MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EXPOSED TO THIS TOXIC CHEMICAL. NOW A COALITION OF HEALTH LABOR AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION TO SUE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AT LAST YEAR A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT ORDER THE EPA TO BAN ALL USES A QUICKER FALLS WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. BUT THE AGENCY APPEAL FURTHER. USEPA HAS NEVER DISPUTED THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY ITS OWN SCIENTISTS AND INSTEAD HAS BASED HIS LEGAL ARGUMENTS ON ON RELATED PROCEDURAL ISSUES. NOW UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE TAKES ACTION CORPORATE FALLS WILL REMAIN ON THE MARKET. THE CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA WILL REMAIN EXPOSED WHILE THE FEDERAL LITIGATION CONTINUES. AND IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO RESOLVE ALL OF THE LITIGATION EVEN IF THE PLAINTIFFS ULTIMATELY PREVAIL. SENATE BILL FOUR FIVE EIGHT WOULD MAKE THE STATE A SAFER PLACE FOR KIDS TO GROW UP.

SIT AROUND THAT SIDE PERHAPS VOTE THE BUTTONS OPPOSITION SIT NEAR [inaudible] OKAY. TWO WITNESSES HERE OKAY AGAIN SIX MINUTES MAXIMUM THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LEARN ONLY PAGE ON BEHALF OF WESTERN PLAN HEALTH ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA CONGENERS IN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WESTERN OUR PROCESSORS THIS PAST YEAR -- GROWERS AND VARIOUS OTHER AG TRADE ASSOCIATIONS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- THE CORPORATE BOSSES A TOOL THAT AGRICULTURAL. COMMODITIES IN CALIFORNIA USED TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM AN BASIS A PASS -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THOSE THOUGH WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE LEGISLATURE. IN AN OUTRIGHT BAN IS TAKING THAT OUT OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND THAT'S TAKING A TOOL OUT OF THAT TOOL BOX -- THERE WAS SOME COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO THE SCIENCE BUDGET CLARIFY SOME OF THE TIMELINE ISSUES -- EPA HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND PROPOSED A BAN ON FOR PEER FASTER THAN ITS OWN SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY PANEL UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. SAID THAT MORE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES NEEDED TO BE DONE AND SO THERE WAS A HOLD ON THAT IN THAT WAS STILL UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THE THING ABOUT CALIFORNIA THOUGH HE IS EVEN NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE IN CALIFORNIA IS STILL DO OUR OWN THING WE ARE THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION THAT HAS A DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION OR DPR. AND BEFORE -- PESTICIDE CAN BE REGISTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA CPR HAS TO DO ITS OWN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION THAT LOOKS AT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES LOOK AT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. LOOKS AT THE TOXICITY AND DETERMINES IF THAT PESTICIDE SHOULD BE REGISTERED IF THEY DETERMINE IT SHOULD BE REGISTERED THEY CAN PLACE RESTRICTIONS IN MITIGATION MEASURES ON THAT PESTICIDE. TO ENSURE THAT HUMAN HEALTH HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE BEING PROTECTED ONCE IT'S REGISTER THERE'S A CAN FOR TEN YOU ALL EVALUATION AND DATA COLLECTION. BY DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. IF ANYTHING IN THAT CONTINUAL EVALUATION LOOKS LIKE THAT IT WOULD HAVE AN UNREASONABLE FACT ON HUMAN HEALTH. IT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERS RE EVALUATION TO DETERMINE IF THAT PESTICIDE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE REGISTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FEELS HAS BEEN IT READ HAS BEEN REGISTERED AND STUDIED HERE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE -- NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BUT MOST RECENTLY I'M IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT BECAME A RESTRICTED PESTICIDE WHICH MEANS NO HOUSEHOLD USE. AND AT THAT IT ALSO HAS TO BE APPLIED BY A CERTIFIED PESTICIDE APPLICATOR YOU JUST CAN'T BE ANYONE IN USE THIS PESTICIDE ALSO RIGHT NOW. DPR IS WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD IN OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. TO RE EVALUATE THIS PESTICIDE AND DO ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES AND RESTRICTIONS ON IT WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT -- BASED ON THEIR TIME LINE IT WILL BE DONE WITH THAT RE EVALUATION THIS FALL. SO DEEP HERE IS DOING ITS OWN THING SEPARATE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW -- AS TO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD AND WE WE APPRECIATE ALSO YOUR CONCERN WITH CORPORATE FAST AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL DO HAVE TO STAY OPPOSED WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS -- CALIFORNIA HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DOING PESTICIDE RESIDUE TESTING ON OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES SENSE NINETEEN TWENTY SIX SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME. THAT HAS BECOME THE MOST ROBUST PESTICIDE RESIDUE TESTING IN THE ENTIRE NATION -- WHAT DO YOU CARE DOES IS IT GOES OUT TO THE FIELDS AND IT LOOKS IT COLLECTS SAMPLES -- BECAUSE FARMERS MARKETS -- PLACES OF DEPOT PORT CENTER TO SEE IF A IN CDF. FAA TESTS THOSE SUBJECTS FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PESTICIDES. IF THERE IS ANY ILLEGAL PESTICIDE RESIDUE ON THERE IT IS IMMEDIATELY PULLED FROM THE SHELVES SO WE ARE ALSO TESTING THIS AND THE SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT SAMPLES THAT IMPACT OR THAT CHILDREN EAT FOOD THAT CHILDREN TEND TO EAT AND ALSO THOSE. COMMODITIES THAT MAY USE CHEMICALS THAT -- WOULD HAVE SOME TOXICITY TO THEM -- SO IN CONCLUSION WE WOULD JUST REQUESTED THAT THE COMMITTEE LEAVE THIS TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS LET THAT CONTINUE AND NOT PANIC HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY NAME IS CAROL BURNS I'M A RETIRED EPIDEMIOLOGISTS FROM THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY. I OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL TO BAN CHLORPYRIFOS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE PLEASE DON'T DISMISS MY COMMENTS BECAUSE I'M A CONSULTANT FOR CAN CORTES. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THIS CHEMICAL AND I HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME WHEN I STARTED WORKING AT DOW I WAS PREGNANT WITH TWO OF MY THREE TWELVE DIFFERENT TIMES I WAS PREGNANT ONCE AND BRING IT AGAIN START. ANYWAY THE CLERK YOUR BUS PLAN IS ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY OFFICE. SO I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THIS AND LIVING IN A COMPANY TOWN. THE PEOPLE THE MEN AND WOMEN TO MAKE CLEAR PURIFY US ARE MY FRIENDS MY NEIGHBORS MY KIDS SOCCER COACHES. MY VIEWS TODAY RESULT FROM TWENTY YEARS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND REVIEWING THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE OF CHLORPYRIFOS NOT FROM MY EMPLOYER. FIRST IT'SIMPORTANT TO KEEP THE SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON CORE PURIFY US. CLIP YOUR PAST IS AN ORGANIC PHOSPHATE BUT NOT ALL OUR GEAR PHOSPHATES ARE CLICK HERE FOR US THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TOXICOLOGY PROFILES. IF YOU'RE TAKING NOTES I APPEAL TO YOU TO WRITE DOWN THESE THREE ACRONYMS T. C. P.. D. E. P. E. N. D. A. P.. THERE IN INVERSE. ORDER OF SPECIFICITY. T. C. P. STANDS FOR TRICOR APPEAREDIN ALL IS THE MOST SPECIFIC METABOLITE OF CHLORPYRIFOS. D. ET DI APPLE BOSS FATE IS A METABOLITE THAT REPRESENTS UP TO TEN ORGAN PHOSPHATES. AND DAB D. OUT DIE ALKA PHOSPHATE REPRESENTS UP TO TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT INSECTICIDES. IS THE BEST SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE TO COMPARE LIKE FOR LIKE SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT RESULTS PLEASE LOOK FOR TCP OR D. E. P.. SECONDLY IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED. THAT DPR REGULATION OF CHLORPYRIFOS HAS RESULTED IN CHANGED USES REDUCE DRIFT AND AS A RESULT EXPOSURE POTENTIAL HAS DECLINED IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE MOST PART THE STUDIES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED ARE AND CHILDREN BORN IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES IN THE FIRST DECADE OF TWO THOUSAND THE TO NEW YORK CITY STUDIES ARE ABOUT INDOOR APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE NO LONGER REGISTERED. THERE ARE TWO AUTISM STUDIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT RELIED ON PROXIMITY ON AN APPLICATION AND RESIDENTS. AND THESE RECORDS WERE FROM THE NINETEEN NINETIES TO TWO THOUSAND TEN AND THAT THIS ADDRESS WRAP UP UP AND COMING ON WE REASSURINGLY THE AUTISM STUDY OF CHILDREN BORN. AFTERWARDS FOUND NO LINK OF CHLORPYRIFOS. FURTHER THE HOME STUDY IN OHIO CAN DISPEL THE CONCERNS ABOUT RESIDUE SINCE NO ADVERSE ASSOCIATIONS WERE REPORTED. I OF AND AGAINST THIS BILL. THANK YOU OTHER -- IT IS IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATTHEW WELL WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WE WOULD ASSOCIATE COMMENTS MADE -- WITH THOSE MADE BY AND THIS NON HATE THANK YOU. MEMBERS MY CANNELLA WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION WINE GRAPE GROWERS RE -- RESPECT THE OPPOSE THE BILL AND ALSO TODAY IS OUR LOBBY DAY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF GROWERS INDIA CAPITAL TODAY ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU. BILL BERRYHILL COULD STAND EVERYBODY UP THERE -- VERY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL LET YOUR REGULATORS DO WHAT REGULATORS DO. THANK YOU. GOOD STUDENT CENTER. HI JEFF OSTERMAN ALEGRE GROWERS AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY SLED BETTER VINO FARMS ONE GRAPE GROWERS STRONGLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. KALRA LIMÃ³N FOURTH GENERATION FARMER STRONGLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. ANY BLACK A FARMER FROM WHAT I CALIFORNIA I OPPOSE. THANK YOU. HI OTHER BLACK FIRST GENERATION GROW OR AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TRICIA GERINGER AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. THANK YOU. TAYLOR OCEAN WITH A CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU DON CAP KIÃŸM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO RESPECTFULLY POST THANK YOU. THAT IS ALL BE ON A B. HAVE THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE IN THE COMFORT HERDERS OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI JULIE NOT ASK ABOUT THE HALF OF THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. DOUBLE A CALIFORNIA GROWERS SO LET THE REGULATOR TO THE JOB. I THINK THIS BILL. THANK YOU RIGHT SEEN OTHER PEOPLE MAKE PHONE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MISS BURN TO YOU SEEM TO HAVE WHERE YOU GO. THEY ARE OKAY -- YOU SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE CLERK -- FOSS -- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ASSERTION ABOUT THE CORE PEER FAUCETS FOUND IN THE HUMAN BODY. WELL THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT REALLY COMES FROM THE CDC PROGRAM IN WHICH THERE BY MANAGED COLLECTING URINE FROM. A SAMPLE OF OF INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND INDEED WE DO SEE VERY LOW LEVELS FAIRLY UBIQUITOUS SEE YOU ACROSS EVERYBODY. BUT THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT FIRST OF ALL -- THEY'RE MEASURING TRICOLOR APPEARED IN ALL AND THAT'S REASSURING BECAUSE IT'S TELLING US THAT IT'S BREAKING DOWN IN THE BODY IT DOESN'T PERSIST IT'S IT'S BEING CLEARED RAPIDLY. BUT WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT CLEAR PURE BUS BREAKS DOWN IN THE ENVIRONMENT ALSO TO TRY CLEAR APPEARED IN ALL. SO IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED BY -- A GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST THAT UP HUMAN URINE. IS TRICOLOR APPEARED IN ALL THAT WAS ON YOUR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES NOT THE PARENT CLICK HERE FOR US SO THIS A BURSTING WHAT WERE MAJOR IN ISN'T CLERK YOUR BOSS AT ALL. SECONDLY FOR TRICOR APPEARED IN ALL IS VERY NON TOXIC AS A VERY DIFFERENT TOXICOLOGY PROFILE BAND CHLORPYRIFOS. THIRDS CDC ITSELF REMINDS US THAT JUST DETECTING SOMETHING DOESN'T IN FOR HARM. AND BECAUSE OUR ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IS SO -- ROBUST NOW WE CAN DETECT VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNTS THAT WE COULDN'T DO TWENTY YEARS AGO [inaudible] OKAY -- SO BASICALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE MONITORING THE METABOLITES THAT'S RIGHT AND SO THE THE HUMAN LIVER IS VERY -- GOOD AT CLEARING OUT -- TOXINS WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO DO -- BUT ONE THING IT DOESN'T DO AS IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT -- WHAT THE THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IS DOING TO THE BODY PRIOR TO IT BEING METABOLIZED RIGHT? I MEAN IT'S IT DOES POTENTIALLY HAVE SOME AFFECTS. SO WE'VE HEARD SOME DISCUSSION -- BY THE OTHERS SPEAKERS TODAY ABOUT -- THE EFFECTS THAT ARE SEEN IN LABORATORY ANIMALS AND I WOULD REMIND THEM THAT -- DOES LABORATORY ANIMAL STUDIES ARE DONE AT A MILLION TIMES HIGHER. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IT AND THE HUMAN BODIES IN THESE -- BY MONITORING PROGRAMS AND THE FOOD RESIDENTS A MILLION TIMES. OKAY. SO THE P. R. IS GONE INVOLVED AND JUSTIFIABLY SO AND I AND I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE PREEMPTING THEIR REVIEW. BUT THE NOW CLASSIFIED AS A RESTRICTED MATERIAL ONLY TRAINED LICENSED PROFESSIONALS BUT THE PERMIT -- FROM A LOCAL COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER MAY USE THESE PRODUCTS CONTAINING THE PESTICIDE. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT WAS ADDED TO CALIFORNIA'S PROP SIXTY MY LIST OF CHEMICALS KNOWN TO CAUSE REPRODUCTIVE HARM AND SO -- IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT THE UTILIZATION OF THIS PESTICIDE IS DOWN 50% FROM ANY. MODERN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES. THAT SHOW WHAT'S HAPPENING -- IN THE TWO WEEKS TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TIME PERIOD RIGHT SO MOST EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDIES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- OF OUR OWN CHILDREN BORN LONG BEFORE THAT -- THERE ARE SOME MORE RECENT STUDIES OF NOT IN CALIFORNIA ONE IN THE NETHERLANDS ALSO SHOWING NO ADVERSE EFFECTS -- WITH RESPECT HI Q. -- WE HAD THE RECENT AUTISM STUDY FROM UC DAVIS SHOWING NO -- ATTACKS WITH FOR PURE BOSTON ARTISAN SO I THINK THOSE KINDS OF STUDIES GIVE THIS REASSURANCE THAT -- WE ARE THE MODERN DAY METHODS OR THE MODERN DAY STUDY METHODOLOGY AREN'T SHOWING AN EFFECT. OKAY AND AND SO -- WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE? TO THREE PROPONENTS. LIST OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE SOME VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. WITH MD DEGREES PH DIS -- THAT ARE RAISING THE FLAGS ARE CONCERNED WHAT BOOK WHAT WOULD YOU TELL US THAT ARE READING THESE [inaudible] THESE WARNINGS. RIGHT WELL AND AND MY COLLEAGUE HERE I I YOU KNOW I RESPECT THEIR THEIR OPINIONS AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO COMPARE LIKE WITH LIKE THAT WE CAN'T JUST COMPARE ALL ORGANIC PHOSPHATES IN THIS CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT CHLORPYRIFOS. THE QUESTION IS IS IT CLICK HERE FOR US THAT'S THE QUESTION ON THE TABLE AND IT'S EASY TO LOOK AT ALL OUR GAL FIVE SPEEDS AND MANY DIFFERENT -- DISEASES IN DIFFERENT STUDIES THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS DEMANDS THAT WE LOOK LIKE FOR LIKE. IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT I. Q. LIST LOOK AT I. Q. -- THE COLUMBIA STUDY LOOKED AT WORKING MEMORY WELL THE TO MARCUS STUDY DIDN'T FIND AT SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO FOCUS ON CLICK HERE FOR US TODAY -- DESPITE -- APPEARANCES THAT YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE A FAX ALLEN A BROADER SCALE. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE LETTER DOES TALK ABOUT KEFIR FAUCET IT DOES TALK ABOUT OTHER ORGAN PHOSPHATE SO IT'S IT IS KINDA LUMPING EVERYTHING TOGETHER. BUT THERE ARE INTERMISSIONS WHICH ICLUDES BANNING ALL AERIAL APPLICATIONS OF CLICK HERE FONT. DISCONTINUED USE ON MOST CROPS IT'LL BE RESTRICTED TO CRITICAL CROPS SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS OKAY IF THIS BAND WERE TO BECOME LAW. WHAT CROPS IN CALIFORNIA ARE WE AT RISK OF? NOT BEING ABLE TO APPROPRIATELY GROW. THANK YOU SENATOR OF OUR KNOWING HE CHECK -- SO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DO HAVE LIKE IN OUR CITRUS GROVES. IS -- THEIR SUGAR RAMPS THESE ALSO AFFECTS SOME OF OUR NOT CROPS AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S JUST VERY VERY HARD TO KNOCK DOWN SUGAR AND POPULATIONS -- THEY'RE VERY AGGRESSIVE CHLORPYRIFOS IS ONE IS IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S EFFECTIVE ON THEM AND KNOCKING DOWN THEIR POPULATIONS AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE SHOULD GRANT. IS THAT THEY PROTECT OTHER INVASIVE PESTS BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO COLLECT THE HONEY DO YOU OFF OF THOSE PASSED IN THE NAY ACTUALLY HER HARM BENEFICIAL INSECTS. SO WHEN YOU GET THESE INFESTATION OF SUGAR ANTS YOU JUST NEED TO KNOCK HIM DOWN BECAUSE THEY'RE HOARDING OTHER PASS AND HURTING ARE BENEFICIAL INSECTS -- ANOTHER ONE ON OUR ON DIED -- IS DETRIMENTAL TO COTTON IT CAUSES IT IT'S CALLED STICKY COTTON -- AND IT BASICALLY BECOMES SO THAT YOU CAN'T SELL YOUR COTTON -- CHLORPYRIFOS IN THIS WAS DONE BY RESEARCH BY THE UC'S IS THE ONLY. TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE ON THIS PAST AND IF THAT CAN'T BECOME STICKY -- THE MILLS WILL REJECT IT SO BASICALLY YOUR CROP IS GONE SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF WHY WE NEED A AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID THIS IS JUST ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. FARMERS TRY ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF METHODS BEFORE THEY GET TO KIND OF THIS ORGANIC PHOSPHATE AND USING CORPORA FOSS BUT SOMETIMES WITH THESE INVASIVE PESTS THERE'S REALLY NOTHING ELSE. OUT THERE THAT JUST KNOCKS THEM DOWN AND GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY OKAY SO SO THE THE SENATOR -- MADE REFERENCE TO TO RATE THAT -- WE USED TO BE IN RATE AND THEN IT WAS RECLASSIFIED IF ANOTHER CHEMICAL THAT COULD DO THE JOB SO. AFTER HEARING WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT -- THIS THIS PESTICIDE IS USES A LAST RESULT RESORT TO SAVE A PRODUCT THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO CULTIVATE A CALIFORNIA CORRECT OKAY AND THEN -- ON THE PASSAGE PESTICIDE RESIDUE ISSUE YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU EXPLAIN HOW IT THE CROPS ARE TESTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO RESIDUE SO IS IT UP TO THE FARMER TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THOSE ARE DELIVERED THEIR THEIR CROPS -- LET'S SEE THE THE ORANGES OR OR WHATEVER TO THE GROCERY STORE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE TO CLEAN THOSE CROPS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO RESIDUE. AND THAT DOES COME UNDER FARMERS AND PACKING SHEDS AND HOWEVER THAT SUPPLY CHAIN GOES PART OF NOT HAVING RESIDUE ON YOUR CROPS THOUGH IS THOSE RESTRICTIONS THAT DPR HAS PUT IN PLACE. OF WHEN THINGS CAN BE APPLIED ONE REENTRY IS HOW YOU HAVE TO APPLY THEM BEFORE HARVEST SO THERE'S A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE ON ALL PESTICIDES. ON WHEN AND HOW YOU APPLY THEM TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NOT RESIDUE. THEN THERE STEPS AFTER THAT AND THEN THAT'S WHEN DPR STEPS IN AND SAMPLES TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE'S DOING ANYTHING ILLEGALLY -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY GET INTO THESE ISSUES BUT THERE'S RESTRICTIONS ON THE GROUND AND THEN FARMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THOSE ARE BEING FOLLOWED SO THERE IS NOT THIS RESIDUE ISSUE SO IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IT IS THE CONSUMER THIS MAN. DOESN'T HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THAT THE RESIDUE IS NOT ON THE FRUIT THAT IS UP TO THE THE GROWER AT CENTER ACT AND THAT'S WHY DEEP HERE AND SEE IF THEY HAVE PARTNERED UP AND WHY THERE IS SUCH A ROBUST. PROGRAM TO ENSURE -- IN EITHER NO DETECTION A RESIDUE OR WAS FAR BELOW USEPA TOLERANCE LEVELS THAT WERE REQUIRED. OF THE 4% THAT DID HAVE LEGAL RESIDUE 72% OF THAT WAS FROM OUT OF COUNTRY SO THAT SOME OF THE RESIDUE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TO THESE ARE COMING FROM. OUT OF COUNTRY IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE VERY RESTRICTIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS. THANK YOU CEREMONY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN [inaudible] SOME. APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY OF SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PESTICIDES IN USE IN CALIFORNIA. DURING MY WORK THAT INVOLVED REPRESENTING VICTIMS OF PESTICIDE EXPOSURE. WE SAW A DD EIGHTEEN T. OKAY MEDICINE STOCKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT PESTICIDES YOU KNOW THEY HAD IN COMMON. THEY WERE ALL EVENTUALLY BANNED BY THE EPA AFTER. FARMWORKERS HAD SUFFERED ILLNESS. A CHRONIC. ILLNESS BIRTH DEFECTS IN WRONGFUL DEATH AFTER EXPOSURE -- THE CHEMICALS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE EPA. THE ONES THAT I MENTIONED ALL USE SOMETHING CALLED ECONOMIC NECESSITY. SO THEY FOR STONE GOING THROUGH THE PHONE ANIMAL STUDIES AND ALLOWED EXPEDITED ACCESS OF THE CHEMICALS INTO THE MARKET PLACE BECAUSE THEY WERE SO IMPORTANT. FOR USE IN AGRICULTURE. THAT WAS IN AN ERA WHEN FARMWORKERS. WERE [inaudible] REALLY -- DISCOUNTED. IN THE CONCERN FOR EXPOSURE. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY IN TWO CONSTITUENTS OF MINE. SCHOOL TEACHERS PARENTS STUDENTS CONCERNED ABOUT APPLICATIONS NEAR SCHOOLS. SO DPR HAS CONVENED PUBLIC HEARINGS. DAVE. CREATED GREATER CONTROLS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. NO APPLICATION DURING SCOOL HOURS. SO THAT THAT PROTECTS STUDENTS IN SCHOOL DURING SCHOOL HOURS. BUT THEN I CREATE SO A WINDOW ON WEEKENDS. THAT IF YOU CAN'T SPREE DURING SCHOOL HOURS YOU'RE GONNA SPRING ON THE WEEKEND. SO THERE MAY NOT BE STUDENTS IN CLASSES AT THE SCHOOL. BUT IF THERE RESIDENTS IN NEIGHBORHOODS NEAR THAT SCHOOL. THEY ARE NOT EVACUATED THEY ARE NOT WORN SO THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY PROTECTED. AND THEY MAY ALSO BE THE HOMES OF CHILDREN THAT ATTEND THAT NEIGHBOR OR SCHOOL. THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. WE ALWAYS GET TONED IT'S NOT CONCLUSIVE WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH LET'S JUST STUDY A LITTLE BIT LONGER. WELL. IF YOU ARE THE PARENT OF A CHILD WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM EXPOSURE. AND IF YOU LIVE IN THE SALINAS VALLEY AND YOUR KIDS THAT LIVE AROUND THE SPREE AREAS. HAVE SHOWN PROVEN -- THE DEFICIENCY IN I. Q. AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT -- YOU CAN'T WAIT. FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. ANOTHER TEN YEARS ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS -- THIS LEGISLATURE HAS NOT PRACTICED [inaudible] PICKING CHEMICALS IN BANNING THEM. VERY FREQUENTLY THE LAST TIME I REMEMBER WAS WITH THE CHEMICAL CALLED METHYL AYE AND DIED. IN IT WAS SEEN AS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO METHYL BROMIDE WHICH IS AN OZONE DEPLETING. SO WAS LESS TOXIC TO THE ENVIRONMENT. INTERESTINGLY IT WAS OF MUCH GREATER TOXICITY. IN HUMAN EXPOSURE. IT COULD BE LETHAL IN VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNTS. THE MANUFACTURE ON THAT ONE EVENTUALLY WITHDREW ITS REQUEST FOR PERMANENT FOR USE IN CALIFORNIA. IN ALL THE CROPS THAT SAID DEAN DEPENDED ON THE USE OF MATH ONLINE DIED TO SURVIVE. THEY'RE STILL BEING GROWN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK ULTIMATELY. IT IS A BALANCING TEST. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORK OF DPR TO EXPAND THE BUFFER ZONES. TO MAYBE DO SOME MORE MONITORING AND TO TRY TO PROTECT SCHOOL SITES. THERE'S ALWAYS THE EXCEPTIONS OF WHO DOES GET EXPOSED AYE AYE. THAT'S A BIT OF A STATEMENT I NOW I DO WANT TO ASK THE PROPONENT WITNESSES EITHER ONE OF YOU. THE SCIENTISTS. WE READ ABOUT. TOLERANCE LEVELS RESIDUE LEVELS -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT OF THE EPA TOLERANCE LEVELS ARE BASED ON SOME OF THEM GO BACK TO WORLD WAR. TWO SOLDIERS MAN A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POUNDS OR HEAVIER. DOES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AN INFANT OR A CHILD WHO MAY BE -- A QUARTER OF THAT NGUYEN. AN EIGHTH OF THAT LINK SENATOR THE EPA DOES LOOK AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPOSURE FOR DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN THEY LOOKED AT D. EXPOSURE LEVELS TO CORPORATE COSTS ON FOOD IN THEIR LAST RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THEY FOUND THAT INFANTS WERE EXPOSED TO NINETY TIMES WHAT THE AGENCY CONSIDERED SAFE -- EXPOSE THE CHILDREN WANTED TO YEARS OF AGE ARE EXPOSED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TIMES. BUT THE AGENCY CONSIDERS SAFE. AND SO EPA. BASED ON THEIR METHODOLOGY. THIS FINDING THAT -- CORPORATE FALLS ON FOOD DOES POSE RISKS TO INFANTS AND CHILDREN. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS PART OF A DVRS REVIEW. OF CORPORATE COSTS THE DEPARTMENT DID CONDUCT A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT EVALUATION AND THEY LIKE WHAT IT'S LIKE USEPA. FOUND THAT THE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE TO PREPARE A FALSE ON FOOD AND THE DRINKING WATER -- WERE UNSAFE FOR INFANTS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN FOR OLDER CHILDREN AND FOR WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. SO WE HAVE THIS CONSISTENCY ACROSSTHE AGENCIES THAT LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE. AND THEY FOUND THAT CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO TOO MUCH QUICKER FALLS ON FOOD. IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT TO SAY I THINK IN YOUR STATEMENT. THAT THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION EPA HAD REACHED A CONCLUSION. TO DISALLOW THE CONTINUED USE OF CORE PAIR FOR US. YES THEY CONCLUDED BASED ON THEIR RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT CORPORATE BOSS DOES NOT MEET THE SAFETY STANDARD AND THEY DID PROPOSED A BAN ON ALL FOOD USES OF CORPORATE OFFICE. IN THE RESTORATION OF THE FROM. THE GREEN LIGHT IF YOU WILL BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS. BUT YES IT IS SENATOR AND THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT. ORDER THE EPA TO PANEL USES A CORPORATE BOSS AND WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT LITIGATION SAID ON APPEAL NOW. IT HAS BEEN APPEALED FURTHER BY USEPA AN ORAL ARGUMENT IN THAT APPEAL WAS HEARD LAST MONTH -- THE PROCESS IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE FOR A GREAT DEAL OF TIME. IN PENDING THE CONCLUSION OF THE LITIGATION IS SEEN. SOME. THE PRIOR DETERMINATION TO DISCONTINUE THE USE STATE. IN OTHER WORDS THEY CAN CONTINUE TO USE IT PENDING. THE OUTLANDER FOSTER'S CONTINUE TO BE USED ON FOOD DESPITE US CPS CONCLUSIONS AND DESPITE THE PRS CONCLUSIONS THANK YOU -- IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR JUST A FINAL QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR -- WE WERE PROVIDED -- A DRAFT OF PROPOSED SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- YOU MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED THIS BUT ARE ARE YOU ACCEPTING THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IN THIS I READ THIS -- THERE ARE. TWO SEPARATE CRITERIA THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MET. TO ALLOW FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE USE AND IT'S BASED ON SCIENCE AND IT'S BASED ON LOOKING AT THE EFFICACY OF CONTROL MEASURES ADOPTED BY T. P. R.. IN A INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION THAT THOSE WOULD NOT RESULT IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT HARM TO CHILDREN SECRETARY -- SO. THOSE WOULD BE THE AMENDMENT SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TRAVELED -- I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF AGRICULTURE I THINK ONE THING THAT MARKS THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS ADAPTATION. ADAPTATION THE WEATHER ADAPTATION TO WATER TO DROUGHT -- ADAPTATION TO CHANGING SOIL CONDITIONS AND IT'S HAD TO INCLUDE THE ADAPTATION TO DIFFERENT CHEMICALS THAT HAVE COME ON THE MARKET IN CHEMICALS THAT HAVE BEEN. REQUIRED TO LEAVE THE MARKET SO -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY I AM -- APPRECIATE. THAT WE PUT THE FOCUS TODAY ON THE PREVENTIVE IN PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO PROTECTING. THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHER ETCETERA I THOUGHT IT. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT THE FAMILIES FOR A MEETING WITH ME AND MY STAFF OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS AT THIS. THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS BILL IS TO FAMILIES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND ARE. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE BOTH SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL FOR MEETING WITH US I STILL HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT HAVE NOT. BEEN ANSWERED ON BOTH SIDES AND I'M JUST I'M TRIP I'M DEEPLY TROUBLED I CAN'T SLEEP -- THIS IS THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS SPECIFICALLY MY DISTRICT. AND I THINK THAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I NEED THESE ANSWERS QUESTIONS. ANSWERED THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT BECAUSE I NEED TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THEM WHY I WENT YES OR WHY I WENT NO. AND NEITHER SIDE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE FACTS ON THE YOU KNOW BASIC OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE PASSED. AND YOU KNOW EXCUSE MY YOU KNOW MY IGNORANCE ON THIS ISSUE BUT IT I FEEL THAT THESE ARE JUST KEY QUESTIONS THAT I NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. A DECISION EITHER YES OR NO AND SO YOU KNOW MONTH SO QUESTIONS LIKE THE NUMBER OF PERMITS. THAT ARE IN DISTRICT FORT SENATE DISTRICT FOURTEEN THAT HAVE THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN OUT -- AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO RESIDUE AND THEN. STILL TRY TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING I KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO CITRUS A LOT OF IT IS BEING EXPORTED I KNOW YOU MENTIONED -- HOW ARE? ARE YOU KNOW. A LOT OF THE FOOD THAT WE EAT AND AND IT'S FOUND IN THE YOU KNOW AS AS RESIDUE AND WHAT'S FOUND IN OUR BODY -- IS BEING IMPORTED SO WHAT -- WHAT IS B. E. YOU KNOW AT THE PERCENTAGE OF THE AMOUNT THAT WE WERE PURCHASING AT THE STORES WHAT -- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT. THAT WORK IS SIX CONSUMING IS IT FROM -- IMPORTER PRODUCTS VERSUS UP YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCTS. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY ANSWERS FOR ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER ON THAT BY BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO. IMPORTS FORCES EXPORTS ON A LOT OF THESE COMMODITIES. SO -- AGAIN IT ONE THING THAT I FIND REASSURING IT BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT -- THE LEVELS IN URINE BECAUSE THAT THAT IS THE FUNCTION ONE OF THE THE VALUES OF THE CDC BIO MONITORING PROGRAM BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY IS THAT NEXT LEVEL OF TESTING SO. WE HAVE PROGRAMS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY TO TEST RESIDUES IMPORTS AND AND OTHERWISE IN OUR MARKET BASKET SURVEYS RESIDUE CENTER FOOD AT STEP. ONE THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT'S GETTING INTO OUR BODIES THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU BRING IT HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND YOU WATCH IT YOU PREPARE IT. THAT RESIDUE MAY BE GONE ANYWAY. SO WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS WHAT WE'RE NOT FINDING IS THAT THE LEVELS IN CHILDREN. WOMEN AND MEN IN AMERICA ACROSS THE SAMPLE. IS VERY VERY LOW AND CERTAINLY THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THIS PANEL AND FOR THE U. S. EPA FOR DPR IS IS WHAT IS LOW MAINTENANCE THAT LOW ENOUGH. I MEAN THAT'S A THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER DAY'S TOPIC BUT BUT THAT IS THE REASSURANCE TO ME AS A AS A MOTHER. THAT THE RESIDUES ARE NOT UNDULY PROBLEMATIC. SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND AND FINISH THE QUESTIONS AND IF YOU HAVE A THE ANSWERS TWENTY OF THEM PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SPEAK UP -- YOU KNOW BUT I I WILL SAY THAT I MIXED YOU KNOW EXTREMELY CONCERNED WITH -- DPR NOT BEING ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS -- WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT THE SHOULD BE ALREADY RESOLVED SO -- YOU KNOW WILL BE UPSTANDING FROM THIS BILL TODAY BUT I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND CHALLENGE. BOTH TO BOTH SIDES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I'LL BE ASKING. SO MONTHS THOSE ARE -- WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE COMPETING SCIENCE ANY PARTICULAR PESTICIDE AND ITS IMPACT ON MY CONSTITUENTS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS WHAT STATE AGENCY IS CALLED UPON TO VALIDATE FINDINGS? NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO DO WE HAVE HEALTH DATA FROM THE STATE THAT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE. WHY WHY HAS IT TAKEN SO LONG FOR THE STATE? TO REACT TO THIS ISSUE. DO WE NEED TO REVIEW THE PROCESS CURRENTLY BEING USED TO ANALYZE ANALYZE DATA ON PESTICIDE USE IN IMPACTS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICIES BEING APPLIED. HOW MANY FARMWORKERS DO WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS PESTICIDE? WHAT TYPE OF JOB FOR ME POSITIONS ARE IMPACTED BY THIS LEGISLATION? WHAT JOBS ARE IMPACTED OUTSIDE FARMS LIKE? TRUCKERS ARE PACKING HOUSES. KIND OF BACK TO CHEAT ON THE RESIDUE -- ISSUES WHILE WILL THERE BE. A LOSS OF FARM WORKING JOBS IF THIS PASSES. IF SO HOW MANY. BY AND DO WE HAVE OTHER JOB OPPORTUNITIES LINED UP FOR THEM IF SO. AND ACCORDING TO THE STUDY RESIDUE EXPOSURE CAN CAUSE US HARM TO CHILL AND DO WE KNOW THAT. TO THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF RESIDUE EXPOSURE VISITS VERSUS APPLICATION EXPOSURE. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCTS ARE FOUND IN CALIFORNIA GROCERY STORES AS A TOUCHED ON EARLIER? WHAT PERCENTAGE OF NON CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCTS ARE FOUND IN CALIFORNIA GROCERY STORES? ARE THESE PRODUCTS GROANING CALIFORNIA MOSTLY EXPORTED HOW MUCH OF THESE PRODUCTS TO CURRENT DUKE CURRENTLY WE IMPORT. AND HOW IS THAT EXPOSURE MEASURED SO. IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE. YOU KNOW ASK QUESTIONS. THE ANSWERS TO THE ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ANSWER THEM NOW BUT I'D BE HAPPY. TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS AS WE MOVE ALONG. YEAH I'M ALL TO SAY A FEW WORDS -- ABOUT -- THIS ISSUE OF DISCREPANCIES A ACROSS STUDIES -- ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH AS SCIENTISTS WHEN WE'LL EVALUATING A BODY OF EVIDENCE -- IS THAT. WE EXPECT TO BE SOME INCONSISTENCY FROM ONE POPULATION TO THE NEXT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES MAY HAVE OTHER CO EXPOSURES OTHER. HEALTH ISSUES -- BUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND WHETHER ONE SAID THE HAPPENS TO FIND I. Q. AND OTHER ONE FINDS AUTISM ANOTHER ONE FINDS ADHD ALL OF THESE ARE SERIOUS. DEFICITS IN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO FUNCTION AND TO LEAD FULL PRODUCTIVE LIVES AND REACH THEIR POTENTIAL. SO I THINK -- WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE THOSE DISTINCTIONS IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS BEYOND IF ONE STUDY IS SEEING A LITTLE MORE SOMETHING ELSE -- AS FAR AS APPLICATIONS VERSUS WHAT -- YOU KNOW AND WHAT'S IN THE FOOD. THERE HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY SEVERAL VERY STRONG STUDIES SHOWING THAT IF YOU TAKE IT A FAMILY AND YOU REPLACE THEIR CONVENTIONAL CONVENTIONALLY GROWN PRODUCE. WITH ORGANICALLY GROWN PRODUCE. WITHIN A WEEK ALL OF THOSE RESIDUES IN THE URINE ARE GONE. IN OTHER WORDS. THEY ARE NOT ABSORBING IT. FROM THIS IS IN CHILDREN THIS IS IN YOUNG CHILDREN -- SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THAT EXPERIMENT. AND REMOVED THE CONVENTIONAL PRODUCE THAT HAD IT WOULD HAVE HAD PESTICIDE RESIDUES AND THEY'RE NOT FINDING THESE THESE CHEMICALS SO -- THAT SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR ROUTE OF EXPOSURE IS THROUGH THE FOOD RESIDUES. ARE BASED ON THE SCIENCE THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THOSE. ARE AND AND THEN IN TERMS OF APPLICATIONS AND REALLY WHETHER PEOPLE EXPOSED TO AND I'M GONNA REFER TO THE AUTISM STUDY THAT -- I I ACTUALLY IN THE SENIOR AUTHOR ON THE CAME OUT OF UC DAVIS. AND IN THAT CITY WE USE THE THE THE AMOUNT OF POUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN APPLIED. AROUND THE HOME WITHIN A MILE OR SO. AND THAT WAS THE MEASURE THAT WE USE TO DETERMINE WHO IS EXPOSING WHO WASN'T. WE FOUND THAT THE MOTHERS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO THE CLERK HERE PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;PECIFICALLY FOR PARA&lt;/c&gt;</u> FIRST APPLICATIONS NOT ARE THERE ORGAN OF PHOSPHATE TEST SITES -- WERE THE ONES THAT HAD THE HIGHEST CHRIS FOR AUTISM AND IF IT WAS IN THE SECOND TRIMESTER WE SAW A THREEFOLD HIGHER RISK FOR AUTISM IN THOSE CHILDREN. THERE'S ALSO A STUDY THAT GOES BACK OUT OF A WILD EARLIER THAN THAT CITY BY THE WAY MOST OF THOSE CHILDREN WERE AFTER THE BAND -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WERE BORN AFTER THE BAND ON THE HOUSEHOLD USE OF PESTICIDES TO THE REALLY IT'S IT WAS THE AGRICULTURAL -- APPLICATIONS THAT WERE. THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IN THAT STUDY. AND I THINK MAYBE THAT WAS IT I HAD ANOTHER POINT THAT I'VE GOTTEN ITSELF. HAPPY TO PROVIDE AT THE QUESTIONS TO YOU -- AS WELL OKAY. THANK YOU YOU'RE RAISING THE QUESTIONS AND WE'LL BE GLAD TO A FOLLOW UP AS WELL AND PROVIDE YOU WITH ANSWERS. CENTER STONE. THANKS AGAIN -- MISTER CHAIR -- I WANTED TO STACK COMMAND CENTER CUT -- I THINK YOU HAVE SOME VERY GOOD QUESTIONS AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET THE ANSWERS THOSE QUESTIONS I I WOULD LIKE. TO THE WEAPON MIND SHARING THAT WITH ME I WOULD I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATED. I'M ALSO -- A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED IN THAT -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE A SPECIFIC AGENCY THIS SUPPOSED TO BE GIVING US. OBJECTIVE -- ADVICE ON THESE CHEMICALS SOME OF WHICH ARE VERY DANGEROUS TO SENATOR MONNING HAS ALLUDED TO THEY'RE NO LONGER ON THE MARKET -- I'M ACTUALLY DISMAYED AND A LITTLE BIT ALARMED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION DOESN'T HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE HERE. AND TO TELL US WHERE THEY ARE IN THE EVALUATION OF THIS PESTICIDE. THAT -- IS BEING ALLEGED BY COMPETING INTERESTS OF HAVING SOME SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE ISSUES AND YET HAVE SOME. VERY IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL ISSUES WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT YOUR DISTRICT AND FRANKLY OUR CULTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT MY DISTRICT AS WELL [inaudible] SO -- IT'S ALWAYS ARE EXPRESSED MY FRUSTRATION AND YOU'LL GET DOOLING PROFESSIONALS THAT TO YOU. THEY EACH GET A VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENTS ON EITHER SIDE. BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES THEY WILL POINT TO STUDIES AT OR NOT -- REVIEWED -- AND WE DON'T GET ALL THOSE DETAILS AS WE HEAR ONE SIDE VERSUS ANOTHER -- SO -- I SHARE YOUR CONCERN I HOPE YOU SURE YOUR ANSWERS WITH THE BUT WE SHOULD. BE ABLE TO LEAN ON OUR OWN DEPARTMENT THE SPECIALIZES IN LOOKING AFTER THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE SURE THE PESTICIDES ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. RIGHT -- SO I JUST WANT -- TO SERVICE FIRST OF ALL I WANT THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE IN WORKING WITH ME AND AND TAKING THE AMENDMENT -- AND I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAD IS -- AND I THINK YOU HEAR EXPRESSED HERE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'RE A AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY OF COURSE IT'S OUR JOB TO PASS LAWS AND WE NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S BEHIND. YOUR BILL -- ON THE QUESTIONS OF SCIENCE -- WE MIGHT HAVE A BIT MORE. THE VARIANCE IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY. TO LOOK ACROSS THE SCIENTIFIC LUGER SO FOR SOMEONE AND IN MANY WAYS YOU THINK ABOUT IT WE DID -- YOU KNOW SIX METAPHOR SIX MEN AGAINST WE DID A JOURNAL CLUB AT AND AT UC DAVIS IT WOULD BE AN HOUR YOU KNOW GOING OVER A PAPER SO -- THE THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY DELVE INTO AND WE'RE HERE TO HER IDEA IF DIFFERENT TESTIMONY AND I I DO APPRECIATE BOTH THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS SHARING WITH ME PAPERS -- THAT -- I'VE DONE IT AND ADD UP TO YOU TO LOOK AT AND ANALYZE AND AND AND AND I WOULD SAY IS THAT -- IN IN LOOKING AT THOSE AGAIN YOU KNOW I'M THERE OTHER PEOPLE OR SMARMY WHO KNOWS THAT THERE'S EVEN BETTER INCLUDING AS SOMEONE SITTING IN HIS ROOM MIGHT. DISCLOSE I WORKED WITH -- AVERAGE PER CHILD -- AND SOME OTHERS FIELDS AROUND EPIDEMIOLOGY AND AND HOW THEIR SPECTER -- WORK IS THAT -- WHAT I SEE IN THE PAPERS THAT YOU KNOW IS IT IS IT DEFINITIVELY THE ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT BECAUSE THESE ARE METABOLIZED VERSUS -- WELL YEAH I THINK THERE'S SOME WIGGLE ROOM THERE BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT EVEN THE PAPER'S WHO SUPPOSEDLY SAID WELL. WE DON'T WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING WE DON'T THINK BUT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY I MEAN THAT THERE WERE SOME LITTLE HINTS OF STUFF AND MORE TALKING ABOUT NOR DID ON A CHILDREN'S. RIGHT SO THE THE OUTCOME IS A VERY SERIOUS. ONE AND SO EVEN THOUGH THE PAPERS THAT'S BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING AT ALL WHEN USED TO USE COUNT REALLY DELVE INTO THE NUMBERS THEY SAID WELL. WHAT'S WITH THE TO HAVE SUCH A IT'S THE DISCO CIGARETTES BUT THERE'S SOME THERE WERE SOME WEARING SIGNALS IN THAT RATE AND THEN THE PAPERS THAT WERE SAYING IS A PROBLEM YOU KNOW WE CAN SAY THAT WELL IT'S ACTUALLY THE SENATE IS. BUT THE IT WAS PRETTY STRONG STRONG SO IT'S I THINK GIVEN. THE TYPICALLY THE OUTCOME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE FACT THAT. EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE TAKING SOME SORT OF SIGNAL THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE HAPPENING. IT CERTAINLY MAKES ME PRETTY WORRIED RIGHT AND AND SO YEAH BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IS SAY YOU KNOW. I I I HAVE ANAND I APPRECIATE -- SANDRO'S WORKING AND US AND SPONSORED BILL IS THAT ON ONE LEVEL OF COURSE YOU KNOW I THINK WE DO NEED THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO GO AND WAY AND WHERE WE HAVE MORE OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SCIENCE BE ANALYZE AND AND THEN THE SCIENTIST AWAY AND AND AND THAT. PROCESS AND THAT'S WHY I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENT AT THAT SAME TIME. YEAH I A I HEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND FOR WHATEVER REASON -- THERE MAY BE THAT THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND WE CAN ARGUE LIKE OKAY WELL DVRS LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW ALRIGHT AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE WHAT. IT DIDN'T NEED A YEAR AND A HALF TWO YEARS RIGHT THAT WHILE WERE AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT BEFORE BUT THERE'S NEW HEALTH THERE'S ONGOING EVIDENCE RESEARCH CONTINUES THERE'S A REASON WE CONTINUE TO RESEARCH BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ANSWERED. AND AND IT TAKES TIME AND MONEY TO DO THAT THE ANSWERS ON JUST COME IMMEDIATELY -- THAT -- THAT GIVEN THE OUTCOME OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS AND ALSO SOME CONCLUSIONS. THAT'S WHAT IS A SIMPLE ANY CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY SOME PREVIOUS REGULATORY SOMETHING REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT. IT MAKES SENSE TO SAY WELL LET'S HOLD BACK ON THIS AND LESS WE CAN. YOU KNOW UNLESS WE CAN PROVE WEEK THAT THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AND WHICH IT COULD BE YOU MIGHT BE IS SAFE AND IT DOESN'T THEN. DON'T USE IT PERIOD RIGHT AND THAT'S OF THAT WHAT COMES OUT THAT MAYBE THE CONCLUSIONS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW NINE A PRE JUDGE CONCLUSION. AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE PROPOSING TO SAY LET'S. DO A HOTEL BACK ON USING IT. AND LET THE REGULATOR DO THE WORK BUT THEN SAY THAT. WE'RE GONNA LET THE REGULATORS -- HAVETHE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE ARE THERE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE CAN DO IT. IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HARM OUR MAIN OUTCOME WHICH IS NO DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN AND SO THAT WE'RE NOT THE LAST WORD IS A LEGISLATURE -- BUT WE CREATE A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH TO REGULATORS CAN THEN LOOK AT THE DATA AND SO FORTH. AND BRING IT BACK TO THE RIGHT SORT BRING INTELLECTUALLY THE REGULATORY PROCESS BACK TOGETHER -- SO AND OF COURSE WE DON'T LIKE THAT WE THINK THE REGULATORY PROCESS IS A RIGOROUS OR SOMETHING WE CERTAINLY CAN PASS LAWS TO CHANGE THAT PROCESS AND IT AS WELL BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. THINKING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO WITH THAT -- CERTAINLY I I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND WHAT THOSE AMENDMENTS AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR OF WORKING WITH -- COMMITTEE ON THIS. SO IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL THERE'S A MOVE MOTION ON THE BILL -- SENATOR HOUSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE ONLY SIDE I'M ON TODAY IS TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM BRAIN DAMAGING. CHLORPYRIFOS THAT'S THE SIDE THAT I AM ON AND I APPRECIATE -- THE GUIDANCE AND THE SUPPORT AND THE PARTICIPATION OF EVERYONE -- TO GET TO THE AMENDMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SOME OF THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CEREMONY SECRETARIES CALL THE ROLL. PAN AND I STONE. STONE NOW DRAWS SO I DROVE SO I GROWTH [inaudible] HER TANTO. LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MONNING. MORNING I RUBIO. THE BILL CURRENTLY IS FIVE ONE HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT TO HOLD IT OPEN -- FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ALL MEMBERS. OKAY -- NEXT UP -- CENTER MITCHELL PREPARED ITEM NUMBER. WE OKAY SO THAT'S ITEM NUMBER -- TEN SP FOUR SIXTY FOUR I UNDERSTAND THERE IS -- THERE'S BIPARTISAN -- LOVE FOR THIS BILL. WITH THE CARE. MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOUR SIX FOUR WHICH WILL ADDRESS MATERNAL MORTALITY DISPARITY IN THE STATE AND LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE AT THE RATE OF WOMEN WHO WERE DYING IN CHILDBIRTH DUE TO PREGNANCY RELATED CAUSES WAS DISTURBINGLY HIGH AMONG AND AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. AS EXPECTED CALIFORNIA TOOK SWIFT ACTION AND AGGRESSIVELY TARGET THESE HIGHWAYS WHICH FINALLY TALLY. THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE INVESTED FUNDS MAN AND WOMAN POWERING COUNTLESS HOURS OF RESEARCH TO UPGRADE UNSUCCESSFUL METHODS AND CREATE INNOVATIVE TOOL KITS THAT SAVE LIVES. AND SO ALL THE U. S. REMAINS THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL DEVELOPED NATIONS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN TODAY CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION'S AT LEAST THE NATION AS A STATE WHAT THE LAW WAS SMART. MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES. UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO BLACK WOMEN. DESPITE THE 55% DECLINE IN MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES BLACK MATERNAL MORTALITY IN CALIFORNIA REMAINS THREE TO FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN THOSE OF OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. UNLIKE MANY OTHER DISPARITIES THIS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS LEVEL OF EDUCATION ACCESS TO CARE RISKY HEALTH BEHAVIORS ARE OTHERS ALSO DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN FACT IN MY HOME COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES BLACK WOMEN WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER HAVE A WORSE BIRTH OUTCOMES IN WHITE WOMEN WHO HOLD LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. INSTEAD THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO IMPLICIT BIAS AS ONE OF THE CAUSES FOR THESE WIDE DISPARITIES. A TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY BY THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA FOUND THAT IN A SURVEY OF WHITE MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS. ABOUT HALF BELIEVED. ABOUT HALF BELIEVED. BIOLOGICAL MYTHS ABOUT RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN PATIENTS INCLUDING A BLACK PATIENTS HAVE LESS SENSITIVE NERVE ENDINGS ARE ABLE TO TOLERATE MORE PAIN AND HAVE THICKER SKIN THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THAT WAS IT IN EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN COLLEAGUES THAT WAS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN BLACK WOMEN ARE IN GRAVE DANGER BECAUSE WHEN THEY SAY THEY'RE IN PAINTING KRAUT PRETENSION. SOME PROVIDERS DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. AND LACK THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. SB FOUR SIX FOUR TARGET THIS IS BARELY BY REQUIRING EVERY HEALTHCARE PROVIDER INVOLVED WITH PERINEAL SERVICES IN HOSPITALS AND ALTERNATIVE BIRTH CENTERS TO UNDERGO EVIDENCE BASED IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING. SOME OF THESE BELIEVES AND DIFFERENCES OF STANDARDS OF CARE ARE SO SUBCONSCIOUS BUT THE PROVIDERS MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE OF THEIR IMPLICIT BIAS. THESE TRAININGS WILL CALL ATTENTION TO INTERPERSONAL IMPLICIT BIAS SEES IN ORDER TO CATALYZE A CULTURE IN HOSPITAL. WHERE PROVIDERS CAN DELIVER THE BEST CARE TO ALL THEIR PATIENTS? SB FOUR SIX FOUR WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO TRACK AND PUBLISH MATERNAL MORTALITY AND SEVERE. MORBIDITY RATES TO BETTER MONITOR THESE ISSUES AND HIGHLIGHT THE AREAS AND DEMOGRAPHICS THAT NEED FURTHER INTERVENTION. LET ME GO BACK AND SAY THAT AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS EFFORT. THE ANALYSIS -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH SOME OF THE HOLES IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY BOTH CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION THE ANALYSIS REVIEWS THE BILL LAST PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THOSE MINUTES HOPEFULLY WERE DISTRIBUTED COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF THE RESULT THE FEEDBACK PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. THE FIRST AMENDMENT CLARIFIES THAT THE IMPLICIT BIAS TRINI IMPLEMENTED BY THE HOSPITALS AND BIRTH CENTERS MUST BE EVIDENCE BASED IN ORDER TO ENSURE QUALITY PROGRAM. THE SECOND MEMBER REQUIRES THAT THE DATA PUBLISHED ON MATERNAL DEATH IS RISK ADJUSTED AND DISAGGREGATED INTO REGIONS OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN ORDER TO PROTECT SMALLER AREAS THAT MAY ONLY BE ONE HOSPITALS WE CAN IDENTIFY. THE EXACT SOURCE OF THE NEGATIVE DATA SO IT'S AN EFFORT TO PROTECT -- PRIVACY. WITH ME TODAY AND WE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT WE HEALTH SUPPORT IN BOTH SIDES MOVED UP THE AISLE THANK YOU WE WILL HEAR VERY BRIEFLY. FROM -- TONYA COMMIT TEE WHILE WHO HOLDS A PHD IN EPIDEMIOLOGY AS A PRACTICING LICENSED MIDWIFE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. GEN ROBINSON FLIT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE BLACK ONE FOR WELLNESS -- AND OTHERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS CRITICAL TIMELY MEASURE. A THANK YOU US SIXTY MINUTES ALL OF YOU WANT TAKE LESS FEEL FREE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL AND AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AND I AM AS SHE SAID A LICENSED MIDWIFE I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN COMMUNITY CLINICS FOR TO TWENTY YEARS -- STARTING WITH THE BIRTHING PROJECT CLINIC WHICH BROUGHT ME TO SACRAMENTO. AND BUT I'M ALSO A MOTHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS. AND AND THEY RIP STATE MY DAUGHTER'S FACE THE RISK OF DYING FOUR TIMES THAT OF THEIR COWORKERS AND FRIENDS THEIR ADVANCED DEGREES DON'T PROTECT THEM. THIS IS NOT A TRAGEDY THAT I WANT TO FACE. BUT HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE TRAGEDY WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS. SO IN THE U. S. B. THE ADDITION OF THE PREGNANCY RELATED INFORMATION TO THE DEATH CERTIFICATE IN MANY STATES. HAS IMPROVED THIS IDENTIFICATION. SO LIKE STARTING IN -- TWO THOUSAND THREE A MAJORITY OF STATES REVISED THEIR DEATH CERTIFICATES AND MOST INCLUDED. A PREGNANCY QUESTION COMPATIBLE WITH THE W. H. O. STANDARDS EXCEPT FOR CALIFORNIA AT THAT TIME. AND WITH THAT NEW DATA NATIONAL DATA COLLECTION THE REPORTED U. S. MATURE MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE MORE THAN DOUBLED. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT MOST OF THAT REPORTED INCREASE WAS ACTUALLY AN DUE TO IMPROVE ASCERTAINMENT. OF MATERNAL MORTALITY AS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN PREVENTION EFFORTS. AS IT CAN IDENTIFY AT RISK POPULATIONS AND MEASURE THE PROGRESS OF PREVENTION PROGRAMS. NOW THESE FINDINGS IN THE US OF INCREASING MATERNAL MORTALITY OCCURRED -- WHEN THE WHO REPORTED -- THAT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN OF THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE STE COUNTRIES HAD DECREASING. BETWEEN THIS TIME PERIOD EXCEPT FOR THE US. THE CALIFORNIA MATERNAL QUALITY CARE COLLABORATIVE REPORTS A DECLINE IN MATERNAL MORTALITY HOWEVER THIS IS USING THE LIMITED BIRTH CERTIFICATE DATA. THEY DO REPORT THAT 4270% OF THE DEATHS ARE PREVENTABLE WORK LARGELY PREVENTABLE AND LARGELY DUE TO PROVIDE A FACTORS -- SO THIS IS WHY IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IS NECESSARY MY RESEARCH ALSO INCLUDES A CROSS SECTIONAL SURVEY DISTRIBUTED TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF CHILDBEARING WOMEN TO CAPTURE THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE AS A MATERNITY CARE. INCLUDING DISRESPECT DISCRIMINATION. AND PATIENT DESIGNED ITEMS MEASURED ALL SEVEN DIMENSIONS OF THE WHO TYPE W. H. O. TYPOLOGY FOR MISTREATMENT PRUNING VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE DISCRIMINATION. FAILURE TO MEET PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS OF CARE. POR REPORT BETWEEN WOMEN AND PROVIDERS. AND POOR CONDITIONS PREVENTED BY THE HEALTH SYSTEM. OUR ANALYSIS FOUND DIFFERENCE IN MISTREATMENT BY RACE. SO STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONTEXT OF CARE IN OUR SURVEY ONE IN SIX WOMEN SEVENTEEN POINT REPORTED EXPERIENCING ONE OR MORE TYPES OF MISTREATMENT SUCH AS BEING SHOUTED AT OR SCOLDED BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. BEING IGNORED REFUSE RECEIVING NO RESPONSE TO REQUEST OF HELP. AND OF COURSE RATES OF MISTREATMENT WERE HIGHER AMONG BLACK WOMEN. FOLLOWED BY INDIGENOUS LATINO AND ASIAN REYES. YOUNGER WOMEN HAVING THEIR FIRST BABY LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS AND ELEVATED PREGNANCY AND SOCIAL RISK WERE ALSO RISK FACTORS FOR MISTREATMENT -- ADDITIONALLY REGARDLESS OF THEIR OWN RACE. HAVING A PARTNER WHO WAS BLACK INCREASED A WOMAN'S RISK OF MISTREATMENT [inaudible] SO. WHAT DIDN'T INCREASE YOUR RISK WAS BEING WHITE? NOT HAVING YOUR FIRST CHILD AND BEING OLDER THAN. THIRTY OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MISTREATMENT IS WIDESPREAD DURING CHILDBIRTH IN THE US AND MORE EXPERIENCED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK WOMEN. AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FACE SOCIAL ECONOMIC OR HEALTH CHALLENGES. PROVIDERS MUST BE CHALLENGED TO CONFRONT THEIR BIAS AND NO WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY NO ONE IN THE STATE SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO MISTREATMENT AT THIS PRECIOUS AND VULNERABLE TIME. SO PLEASE WELL YES WITH SENATOR MITCHELL OKAY THE REMAINING WITNESSES OF LESS THAN TWO MINUTES -- OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JAN ROBINSON FLINT I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF BLACK WOMEN ALONE IS WE ARE A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD ORGANIZATION. WORKING MOSTLY A SOUTH LOS ANGELES AND I'M. OUR PROGRAM STARTED WITH THE BIRTHING PROJECT WHICH WAS A MODEL PHONE TEAR OUT TO MENTOR PREGNANT WOMEN. SO TODAY I WANT TO REMIND YOU OF THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY IN THE HEALTH STATUS OF BLACK WOMEN IN. CHARGE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY HOWEVER BLACK WOMEN HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. BLACK WOMEN ARE TWO HUNDRED AND CHILDBIRTH AND COMPRISED 21% A PREGNANCY RELATED DEATHS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE GOOD SHIP JESUS BROUGHT IN SLATE AFRICANS TO THE SHORES OF JAMESTOWN VIRGINIA AND SINCE THEN BLACK WOMEN HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY BEEN DEHUMANIZED. MARION J. SIMS WHO SOME OF YOU IS THE FATHEROF GYNECOLOGY EXPLOITED AND ABUSED HIS SLAVE BLACK WOMEN. THE BILL THIS FIELD OF STUDY. AND THE REMAINS OF THIS TREATMENT ARE STILL PRESENT TODAY. THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION PART A BITTER BATTLE TO KEEP HOSPITAL'S SEGREGATED ANTI TUMOR MEDICAID BECAUSE OF RACISM AND BIAS IN JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY CALLED THE CELLS OF HIM WE HAD A LACKS -- WHO DIED OF NATURAL WHO DIED FROM CHILDBIRTH? SO MY MY JOB HERE TODAY'S ALSO TO BRING YOU THE STORY OF WOMEN WHO I SEE AN LOS ANGELES ONE IS MISS ENTLEY. SHE WAS VERBALLY ABUSED AFL FEARFUL TO GIVE BIRTH ARE IN. HOSPITALS BUT SHE WANTED TO DO IT IN THE BIRTHING CENTER. WHICH SHE WENT TO THE BURKE THE CENTER AN AXE FOR STRESS TESTS. ARE THEY AVE A TOUR THEN THEY TOLD HER SHE WAS TOO FAT. AND TOLD HER THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO IS SEE SECTION AND THEY WOULD NEED TO DO IT RIGHT NOW BUT LUCKILY FOR HER SHE HAD A MID WIVES. WHO CAN INTERVENE AND HELP HER WORKER BIRTH PLAN I ALSO HAVE THE STORY MY LEXS WHO WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM? AND ACTS FOR ULTRASOUND MY LEXUS ENDED UP GOING TO THREE EMERGENCY RULES BECAUSE THEY ALL CONTACTED HER DOCTOR HE TOLD HER SHE WAS GROWN. AND HAVE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING PREGNANT THIS WAS A NINETEEN YEAR OLD -- YOUNG WOMEN. IN MY FAMILY STORY IS THAT OF CARE A JOHNSON IN MANY OF US KNOW HER STORY. SHE WAS LEFT FOR SEVEN HOURS WITHOUT CARE AND WHEN SHE WAS FINALLY ATTENDED TO THEY FOUND THREE LITERS OF BLOOD IN HER ABDOMEN AND SHE DIED LEAVING HER TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AND HOLES BEING BEHIND. IMPLICIT BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE BIRTHING PROCESS MANIFESTED A NUMBER OF WAYS BLACK WOMEN ARE PERCEIVED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE MORE PAIN WE ARE IGNORED WE ARE TREATED WITH DISDAIN. WE ARE THOUGHT ANGRY ARE SIZES USE AGAINST US WERE TOO THIN OR TOO FAT OR TOO ANGRY. AND OUR PARTNERS ARE IGNORED WHEN THEY COME INTO THE ROOM OR SOMETIMES GIVEN THE FINAL AUTHORITY OVER US. THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET UP FOR SO FOR FROM FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND IS REINFORCED EVERY DAY WITH A BIAS MEAL STEREO TYPES AND DANGEROUS IGNORANCE. BLACK WOMEN'S WELLNESS SEES THE CONSEQUENCES EACH TIME WE LOOK AT THE DATA ARE THE HIGH MATERNAL DEATH RATES ARE INFANT DEATH RATES. AND THERE IS NO CORRELATION TO ECONOMIC STATUS EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS OR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. THAT'S A WRAP UP AND MESSING ACTUALLY THE VOTE FOR THIS.

PAN HI AND I STONE. STONE I'D DORADO. DRUGS -- I'D GROWTH HER TADO A TOTAL AYE LEYVA. LEYVA AYE MITCHELL AYE MITCHELL AYE MONNING. MONNING AYE RUBIO. RUBIO AYE. OKAY -- SO THAT THAT IS EIGHT ZERO AND I THINK THAT THE BILLS OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMITTEE APPRECIATE [inaudible] THREE OKAY. OKAY THANKS. TO THE AUDIENCE FOR HANGING IN. WITH US WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE BILLS BY OUR CHAIRMAN. I ASSUME CENTER AND YOU WANNA GO AND FILE ORDER. YES SB SIXTY FIVE WILL BEGIN WITH A C. -- SIXTY FIVE TRY CHAIR A MEMBERS -- WE KNOW THAT HEALTH INSURANCE IS EXPENSIVE AND MY A. WITNESSES WILL GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE STRUGGLES CALIFORNIANS FACE. AFFORDING TO PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING -- EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE HAVE IMPROVED FINANCIAL SECURITY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE GREATER USE OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES. PRIMARY CARE CHRONIC ILLNESS TREATMENT MEDICATIONS AND SURGERY. MORE CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE TO TRY TO REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTH COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS AND ONE THING THAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP KEEP COSTS DOWN. ENCOURAGE ROMAN AND HELP CALIFORNIANS IS INCREASE THE SUBSIDIES THAT WE PROVIDE TO HELP PEOPLE FOR THE PREMIUMS ON PLANS AND I COVERED CALIFORNIA. SO SB SIXTY FIVE WILL CREATE A STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO HELP PEOPLE BUY HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. SB SIXTY FIVE PROVIDE STATE FUNDED SUBSIDIES FOR PEOPLE WITH INCOME UP 26100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO UNDER THE FEDERAL -- ACE UNDER THE ACA. YOU HAVE TAX CREDITS UP 24100% AND PEOPLE HIT THE CLIFF SO WE'RE GOING. TO EXPAND UP 26100% AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- SB SIXTY FIVE ALSO GIVES COVER CALIFORNIA AUTHORITY TO ADOPT THE PROGRAM DESIGNED BUT REQUIRES COVERED CALIFORNIA TO PAY THE SUBSIDY TO THE PLANTS IN THE PLANS WILL COLLECT THE REST OF THE PREMIUM FROM THE CONSUMER. BASED ON THE AB EIGHTEEN TEN REPORT SB -- SIXTY FIVE WITHOUT A INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD BRING IN A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NEW ENROLLMENTS INTO COVERAGE. IT WOULD REDUCE PREMIUMS BY TWENTY ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR AN AVERAGE OF ONE POINT THREE MILLION EXISTING COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES. AND REDUCE PREMIUMS I FORTY DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR AN AVERAGE OF SIX HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND OFF EXCHANGE -- BECAUSE IMPROVEMENT IN THE RISK MIX SO THIS IS GOING TO HAVE AFFECTS NOT ONLY ON PEOPLE WITHIN COVERED CALIFORNIA BUT EVEN OUT OF THE EXCHANGE. NOW IF WE PAIRED THIS WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE IN A PENALTY WHICH WILL BE HEARING NEXT AND AN SP ONE SEVENTY FIVE IF YOU CHOOSE TO PASS THAT AS WELL THE NEW ROMAN ACTUALLY INCREASED BY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SO ALMOST HALF A MILLION. PREMIUMS REDUCED BY THIRTY ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR AN AVERAGE OF SIX HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND OFF EXCHANGE. AND THERE WILL BE FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION MORE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DRAW DOWN MORE FEDERAL FUNDS IN AS A DONOR STATE I HOPE YOU LIKE THAT IDEA BRING BACK MORE MONEY BACK TO CALIFORNIA THAT WE'VE BEEN PAYING. OUT -- OTHER DIFFERENCES. JUST IN THOSE FIGHT AT THAT NOTICE THAT THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T HAVE A PROPOSAL WE HAVE A FEW DIFFERENCES WITH SB. SIXTY FIVE WE THERE. NO ANNUAL PROGRAM DESIGN CHANGES NO RECONCILIATION PROCESS -- BUT WITHOUT THOSE REPORT MODIFICATIONS AS OF TODAY NOW IS THE TIME TO DO THIS WE NEED TO STABILIZE THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE MARKET -- WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRYING TO UNDER MY INSURANCE MARKET MAKE NOTE THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS AT LEAST 5% OF THE INCREASE IN PREMIUMS THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN RESULT OF THOSE THAT THE STABILIZATION. AND SO I WITNESSES HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR WITNESSES JUST LETTING YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE -- UNANIMOUS CONSENT I THINK ON THE ON THE DAY IS HERE. APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE. BEST HEALTH FOR HEALTH TEXAS CALIFORNIA LET ME GIVE YOU FOR A FEW REASONS WHY IT SHOULDBE UNANIMOUS -- SO. ALL WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL OR MORE LIKELY TO ENROLL IN MEDICARE ALL THAT PEOPLE ARE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET TO BUY INSURANCE. OVER 90% OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE -- OR AND ROLLED WHICH IS A GOOD THING A THIRD TO A HALF OF THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO BUY INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE HAVE NOT BOUGHT IT AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF AFFORDABILITY. WE ASK CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE BELOW 4100% OF POVERTY SPENT ALMOST 10% OF THEIR INCOME ON PREMIUMS. AND MORE ON COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER 4100% OF POVERTY. IF YOU'RE A COUPLE IN YOUR FIFTIES OR EARLY SIXTIES DURING MEDICARE YOU CAN SPEND AS MUCH AS 40% OF YOUR INCOME ON THE STANDARD BENEFIT DESIGN. WHICH HAS A TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE FOR YOUR HOSPITAL. I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY AFFORD SAID AND IF YOU TRADE DOWN TO BUY A CHEAPER PRODUCT AND I WE'VE BEEN IN THIS ROOM OFTEN SAYING THIS. THAT HAS A SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE FOR EACH. ONE IN THE COUPLE YOU'RE GONNA SPEND FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER. TWELVE THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON YOUR DEDUCTIBLE SO THAT'S NOT AFFORDABLE PEOPLE ARE NOT BUYING IT PEOPLE WHO BUY C HAVE BOUGHT COVERAGE AND CAL COVERED CALIFORNIA. A THIRD OF THEM SAY THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY AFFORDING FOOD AND RENT A THIRD OF THEM SAY THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY AFFORDING PREMIUMS AND A THIRD OF THEM HAVE DIFFICULTY AFFORDING THEIR CO PAYS. PEOPLE NEED THIS HELP WERE ENGAGE IN A LIVELY DISCUSSION IN THE BUDGET CONTEXT ABOUT HOW MUCH HELP HOW SOON WE CAN GET FOLKS. THIS BILL IS PART OF THAT PROCESS TO MOVE IT FORWARD AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE IN SUPPORT OF IT AND THAT RECOGNIZES PEOPLE. PULL ALL PEOPLE BELOW 6100% POVERTY IS NEEDING HELP THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY. GOOD EVENING JAN FOURTH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- ALIGN MYSELF WITH EVERYTHING COMPELLED TO SEVEN HEALTH ACCESS AND THIS DOES BUILD ON A PROCESS THAT. HAPPENED BETWEEN THESELAST TWO LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS WITH AB EIGHTEEN TEN AFFORDABILITY WORKGROUP AND I AM BY NO MEANS AN ECONOMICS GEEK BUT ITWAS REALLY HEARTENING TO SEE WHERE YOU CAN TAKE AN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WHAT THAT DOES TO THE UPTAKE OF INSURANCE RATES ACROSS POPULATIONS. AND WHAT THAT WILL DO TO RE DIRT REDUCING OUR OWN INSURANCE RATES -- SO THIS IS BASED ON THE WORK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT'S BUILDING OFF THAT IT WILL MAKE COVERAGE AFFORDABLE FOR MORE PEOPLE BOTH AT THE VERY LOW END AND ALL THE WAY UP 26100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. SO WE JUST ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR JUST A MINUTE FURTHER IN SUPPORT PLEASE SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THERESA STARK WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT TODAY WE ALSO SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY VERSION.

SENDER -- SB. ONE SEVENTY FIVE THANK YOU AND I AM STRUCTURE AND NUMBERS -- AS WE JUST THAT I JUST DISCUSSED WITH SB SIXTY FIVE THAT'S THE ONE SEVENTY FIVE IS A SERVER IN MANY WAYS A COMPANION BILL THAT'S NECESSARY TO KEEP CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS STABLE AND OUR PREMIUMS DOWN -- SAID MENTIONED EARLIER THE BENEFITS OF INSURANCE -- AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE WHAT THE MANDATE WILL DO IN TERMS OF ARE ACTUALLY DO RESTORATION OF THE PENALTY AND THE MANDATE WILL DO TO ACTUALLY INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND ALSO -- REDUCE PREMIUMS AS WELL SO -- WITH THAT I HAVE THOUGHT THREE WITNESSES WHO SPEAK FOR THE NEED FOR BILL I'VE ANY CLARK THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY BETH CAPELL FROM HALIFAX CALIFORNIA AND BRICK RAILROAD. A SEA OF THE INSECT MANY AMERICAN HEALTH CENTER THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WELCOME. GOOD EVENING. THE MANY CLARK. APPROVING SB. ONE SEVENTY FIVE IS IMPORTANT TO THOSE WHO LIVE WITH EN MASSE OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE COVERED CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLANS FAR MORE AFFORDABLE. I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH RELAPSING REMITTING MS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO I TAKE A DISEASE MODIFYING THERAPY EVERY SIX WEEKS THAT COSTS ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND IT SUCCESSFULLY CONTROLS MY AMASS NO DISEASE PROGRESSION NO NO I MASS ATTACKS I USE MY HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE REGULARLY. I HAD COVER CALIFORNIAN TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH PRICES ROSE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND BY TWENTY SIXTEEN THE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH AND WAS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE. AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS REPEALED. WITH APPEALS OF INTO. OF INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PREMIUM PRICES ROSE AGAIN WHICH CAUGHT THE 24% REDUCTION AND ROLL MEANT. PREMIUMS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE PREMIUMS ARE JUST TOO EXPENSIVE AND CALIFORNIANS LIKE ME WERE PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET. REINSTATING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD STABILIZE THE COVERED CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE EXCHANGE MARKET AND DECREASE PREMIUM PRICES MAKING THE MORE AFFORDABLE. PEOPLE LIVING WITH A MASS NEED THEIR HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS TO BE AFFORDABLE. THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A DISEASE MODIFYING THERAPY FOR MS WITHOUT INSURANCE IS ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. LIVING WITH A CHRONIC DISEASE IS VERY EXPENSIVE. ON TOP OF PAYING FOR PREMIUMS PATIENTS MUST ALSO PAY FOR DEDUCTIBLES. COPAYS FOR DOCTORS OFFICE VISITS AND DRUG COPAYS AND CO INSURANCE SO IN OTHER WORDS THEY MUST PAY TO USE THEIR INSURANCE. THE NATIONAL MS SOCIETY ASKS FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB ONE SEVENTY FIVE BECAUSE EVERYONE NEEDS HELP INSURANCE NO ONE IS EXEMPT FROM UNEXPECTED ILLNESS OR INJURY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY MY NAME IS PREDICT AROSE I'M THE CEO OF THE SACRAMENTO NATIVE AMERICAN HEALTH CENTER -- WE ARE HEALTH CENTER IN SACRAMENTO MID TOWN -- SERVICE LOW INCOME UNINSURED. AND UNDERINSURED MEMBERS OF THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM HEALTH CENTER REPRESENTATIVES ON SB ONE SEVENTY FIVE REQUIRING MINIMUM ESSENTIAL HEALTH COVERAGE AUTHORED BY SENATOR RICHARD PAN. ALL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW 1-400- ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATIONS SERVING TWENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FOUGHT LONG AND HARD AND ADVOCATED FOR COVERAGE AND ACCESS FOR ALL. WE WERE TOP SUPPORTERS OF THE ACA AND KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE. THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS A LYNCH PIN IN THIS HISTORIC LEGISLATION. LOSING THE TAX PENALTY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN A CA HAS MEANT THAT THE UNINSURED RATE HAS INCREASED. I'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF MY HEALTH CENTER COLLEAGUES THAT THERE AND ENSURE CREEK WAS AROUND 5% AFTER THE ACA. AND HAS NOW SIGNIFICANTLY CLIMBED UP ABOVE 15%. WE BELIEVE THIS IS TO THAT DUE TO THE ZEROING OUT OF THE TAX PENALTY. AT OUR HEALTH CENTER ALONE WE'VE SEEN A 6% INCREASE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. BOB THAT EQUALS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN PATIENTS A MONTH -- WE KNOW THAT TO ENSURE THE YOUNG AND HEALTHY WE KNOW THAT TO ENSURE THEM [inaudible] THE COSTS. BUT THE YOUNG AND HEALTHY IN OUR SOCIETY MUST PARTICIPATE IN A BROADER POOL OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE MANDATE AS A CENTRAL. WHEN EVERYONE HAS COVERAGE WE CAN INSURE COSTUME PREMIUMS ARE MODERATED? AS A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER ONCE EVERYONE IS FULLY COVERED WE CAN COMMENCE THE PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE THAT WE KNOW KEEPS COMMUNITIES HEALTHY. AND WILL REALLY LOWER THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE ACROSS THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT SB ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. BETH COMPEL HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA [inaudible] CALIFORNIA'S EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CUT IN HALF THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAN DO IT AGAIN IF WE BUT IF WE DON'T TAKE STEPS LIKE SB ONE SEVENTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO GO IN THE WRONG DIRECTION PROJECT PROJECTION SHOW BUT THE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE ALMOST A MILLION CALVET MORE CALIFORNIANS. WILL BE UNINSURED BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE ACA AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE IT COMES TO YOU. TIED TO INCREASED AFFORDABILITY HELP AND INCREASED AFFORDABILITY HELP THAT GOES BEYOND SIMPLY THE PENALTY REVENUE THAT'S RAISED BY THE MANDATE. AND SO THIS IS NO THESE TWO BILLS TOGETHER ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF GETTING TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE ALONG WITH SB TWENTY NINE SENATOR DRAWS SAYS BILL. ON HEALTH FOR ALL AND OTHER MEASURES TO EXPAND MEDIC CAL TO SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.

ANY QUARREL WITH YOU'LL TO MY GOAL IN OF COURSE A COUPLE OF OUR MEMBER HEALTH PLANS PARTICIPATED IN RECENT HEARING OF THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT.
