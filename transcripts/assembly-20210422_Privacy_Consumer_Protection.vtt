INFRASTRUCTURE THIS NATURE- I

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:07.952
AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE CONCERN

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:12.056
RAISED BY CC TA- BECAUSE AT IS

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:13.991

TOGETHER- I'VE SEEN THE CHARTS

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:33.010
ON WHERE BROADBAND ACCESS IS AT

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:33.978
ITS BIGGEST DEFICIT ANDS

00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:35.512
PREDOMINATELY RURAL

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:38.582
PARTICULARLY VERY RURAL AREAS-

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:40.184
ALSO SOME CITIES IN MY DISTRICT

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:43.454
ACTUALLY AS WELL- I'M JUST

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.022
CURIOUS AS TO WHAT. WHETHER

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.256
THERE'S OPENNESS TO MAYBE

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:48.125
TIGHTENING UP THOSE DEFINITIONS

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:50.027
OR DOING. SOME SORT OF

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.195
DIFFERENT THING DEFINITIONAL

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:52.696
LEASE OF THE WE KNOW THE

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:54.498
MONEY'S GOING TO. AREAS THAT

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:57.301
DON'T HAVE THIS STUFF DON'T

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:59.403
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOT

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.038
GOING TO MAYBE REDUNDANCIES IN

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:03.540
PLACES THAT ARE ALREADY SERVED

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:04.108
BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIONAL

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:06.477
THING. SO LET'S ALL START BY

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.846
SAYING THAT- I KNOW THAT IF FOR

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.080
THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR WAS HERE

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:12.483
HE WOULD MAKE IT VERY CLEAR.

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:15.285
THAT HIS GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:16.620
UNSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:18.522
PLACES LIKE THE ONES THAT BOTH

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:21.091
YOU AND I REPRESENT- VERY

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:23.527
DIFFERENT IN THEIR AREAS THAT

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.329
HE REPRESENTS A REDONDO BEACH.

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:28.298
AT THAT ARIAS ARE HIS PRIORITY

00:44:28.365 --> 00:44:30.334
AND I KNOW THAT HE CONTINUES IN

00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:33.771
DISCUSSIONS WITH OPPOSITION- TO

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:34.705
TRY TO CLARIFY THOSE

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:36.206
DEFINITIONS IN THIS BUILDING

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:38.108
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.410
DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:43.280
COMMUNITIES HAS COME UP AS A

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:44.381
POINT OF CONTENTION AND DEBATE.

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:45.649
WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN WHO

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:47.484
DOES THAT REALLY ENCOMPASS. AND

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.585
SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SOME

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:50.287
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.156
DEFINITION. I SHOULD BE

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.690
UTILIZED SO THAT WE'RE NOT

00:44:53.757 --> 00:44:56.627
EXCLUDING OUT FOLKS FROM THE

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.862
ABILITY TO EITHER ADDRESS THE

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:01.365
UNSERVED. COMPONENT OR IN SOME

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:03.167
CASES THE UNDERSERVED WHERE

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:04.802
THEIR NEEDS ARE NOT SO MUCH

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:05.502
ABOUT BUILDING THE

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:07.371
INFRASTRUCTURE PER SE BUT TO

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:09.339
INCREASE. CAPACITY AND SPEED

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:11.208
RIGHT SO I THINK HE IS AN

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:13.444
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS BUT I WILL

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.679
START. I WILL REITERATE AGAIN

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:17.147
THAT IF HE WAS HERE HE WOULD BE

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:20.517
SAYING TO YOU TO ME. I AM

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:21.118
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:23.821
AREAS- GET THE INVESTMENT

00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:25.856
BEFORE AREAS LIKE MINE IN THE

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:27.691
IN THE HIS CASE. AT REDONDO

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:30.527
BEACH- GET THE PRIORITIZATION

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:33.564
FIRST SO I'LL- STOP THERE. AND

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.832
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE'S

00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:37.167
GOOD FAITH- EFFORT TO TRY TO

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:39.203
CLARIFY THAT. I THINK I THINK

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:40.604
THAT'S A GREAT ANSWER ACTUALLY

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:42.206
LIKE YOUR IDEA OF MAYBE

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.341
DEFINING IT AS- UNSERVED AND

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.110
UNDERSERVED THAT MIGHT BE SORT

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:47.945

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:35.784
POINT ABOUT INCREASING CRIMINAL

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.552
PENALTIES NOT BEING THE ANSWER

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.653

THAT IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY.

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:01.009
RECORD ON PUBLIC SAFETY- BUT I

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.777
THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS A

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:03.712
TIME AND PLACE TO LOOK AT

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:05.480
INCREASED. PENALTIES AND

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.881
INCREASED FINES ONE OF THE

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:08.717
THINGS WE'RE HEARING FROM LAW

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.385
ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK. THAT

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:11.286
IF YOU ARE IN YOUR COMMUNITY

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:12.387
BUT I KNOW IN MY COMMUNITY

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:13.221
ARTISTS AND WE TALK ABOUT A

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.190
LOT. OF IN PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE

01:23:15.256 --> 01:23:16.157
LEGISLATURE IS A LONG PERSON

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.092
OFTEN SAYS IF IT'S A

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:18.159
MISDEMEANOR IT'S NOT GOING TO

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.761
CHARGE FOR THE DA AND- SO

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.096
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO AND SO

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:22.097
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.431
HERE IS. ENSURE THAT THERE'S A

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:25.166
RESPONSE THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:26.735
THESE THREATS AND VIOLENCE TO

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:30.338
BE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND SO

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:30.872
THAT'S WHY THESE ARE BEING

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:31.439
INCREASED FOR MISDEMEANORS.

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.742

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.411
BEEN MOVED SECONDED- OTHER

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.046

THAT- A BILL MOVED OUT OF

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.191
PUBLIC SAFETY THAT ACTUALLY

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:51.659
TAKES THINGS FROM A MISDEMEANOR

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:53.995
TO A FELONY BECAUSE AND MANY

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.063
OTHER CASES THAT IS NOT BEEN

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.298
THE CASE. I FIND IT IRONIC THAT

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:59.801
WERE ALSO CONSIDERED IN THIS

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.269
LEGISLATURE ABILITY TO-

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.203
DECRIMINALIZING MAKE

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:04.072
MISDEMEANORS. OR REDUCE THE

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:05.507
CRIMINALITY OF ACTUAL

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:08.309
ROBBERIES. WE'RE AS WE'RE

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:09.310
TRYING TO CRIMINALIZE WHAT IS

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:12.147
CLEARLY PROTECTED SPEECH. AND

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:13.648
IT'S BEEN MADE VERY CLEAR UNDER

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:16.751
THE SUPREME COURT- DECISIONS

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:17.519
THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN ON

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:20.789
THIS ISSUE- JUST LIKE- AB SEVEN

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:23.358
SEVEN FIVE- FROM. WHAT FOUR

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:25.293
YEARS AGO. IF THIS BILL PASSES

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.662
ALONG TO ABSOLUTELY BE STRUCK

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.398
DOWN AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL- AND

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:31.599
SO I THINK WE SHOULD YOU KNOW

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:32.834
ESPECIALLY IN THESE COMMITTEES

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:35.036
WERE IT WERE CONSIDER PEOPLE'S.

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:37.205
RIGHTS WE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:38.640
TO PROCEED WITH BILLS THAT WE

01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:40.775
KNOW ARE ABSOLUTELY. NOT

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.477
CONSTITUTIONAL BASED ON LAWS

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:44.879
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN. STRUCK

01:24:44.946 --> 01:24:46.347
DOWN BY THE COURTS IN BY

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:47.682
DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:50.218
DOWN BY OUR HIGHEST COURT- SO I

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:50.819
WOULD JUST REALLY ENCOURAGES

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:53.621
COMMITTEE- TO NOT GET WRAPPED

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:55.323
UP IN THE EMOTION MAYBE OF THIS

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:57.692
ISSUE BUT ACTUALLY LOOK AT IT-

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.127
FROM THE- PERSPECTIVE OF THE-

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:00.962
OF THE CLEAR LAW ON THIS THAT

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:01.563
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WITHIN A

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:03.398
HUNDRED FEET THERE. AND ALMOST

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:05.567
ALL THOSE- SITUATIONS ARE

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.368
LIKELY GOING TO BE ON A PUBLIC

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:10.071
STREET OR A PUBLIC SIDEWALK-

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:10.572
ARE ABSOLUTELY LOUD TO

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:12.874
VIDEOTAPE. AND I THINK THAT THE

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.075
POINT THAT WAS RAISED BY THE

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.710
OPPOSITION IS A GOOD MORNING.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.612
WOULD YOU AND IN THE SAME CASE

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:20.782
SAY THAT SOMEONE COULD

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:21.950
VIDEOTAPE POLICE. ARRES OF THE

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:24.986
CITIZEN. AND IF YOU IF YOU

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:26.921
WOULD BE OPPOSED IF YOU WOULD

01:25:26.988 --> 01:25:29.224
ACTUALLY BE OPPOSED TO BANNING

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.326
THAT RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO DO THAT

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:33.495
HOW CAN YOU THEN BE OKAY WITH

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:35.330
BANNING SOMEONE'S RIGHT TO DO

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.465
IT IN THIS SITUATION. WE HAVE

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:39.133
TO BE CONSISTENT. THE LAW IS

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.103
CONSISTENT. IT'S BEEN

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:45.507
CONSIDERED AND WE SHOULD BE.

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:47.575
ABIDING BY OUR OATH TO UPHOLD.

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:50.144
THE CONSTITUTION AND THE CLEAR

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:51.346
LAW THAT'S BEEN THAT IS COME

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:54.582
DOWN AND IN IN THE STATE AND IN

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.518
THIS NATION. ON THIS VERY ISSUE.

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:57.919
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:01.489
COMMITTEE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL.

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:03.491
MISS WHICH COULD HAVE. I WAS

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:07.028
GONNA TALK BUT- YEAH JAMES HE

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:10.798
PULLED ME IN- THIS BILL SUPPORT

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:11.633
I WOULD FOR THIS BILL AND

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.001
PUBLIC SAFETY AND I VOTED FOR

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.636
THIS BILL BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:16.070
HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:17.405
DEMONSTRATE AND PROTEST IN THIS

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:19.641
ALSO ALLOWS FOR THAT. BUT WE

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:22.143
DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO DO IS IF

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.811
AS SOMEONE WHO WAS WALKED INTO

01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:25.914
A PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC TO

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:27.348
GET AN ABORTION TO BE

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:30.218
VIDEOTAPED WHILE I'M ENTERING

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:31.986
THAT BUILDING TO HAVE THAT THEN.

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:33.621
PLACED WHEREVER ON THE INTERNET

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:34.722
AND THAT IS AN INVASION OF

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.291
PRIVACY IN MY OPINION AND IT IS

01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:37.592
IN THOSE MOMENTS OF TIME WHEN

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:39.527
WE NEED TO RESPECT A WOMAN'S.

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:40.962
RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE RIGHT TO

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.397
PRIVACY AT CENTER AND I THINK

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:44.732
THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR. THE

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:47.068
NECESSARY- OUR RIGHTS TO

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:50.505
PROTEST DEMONSTRATE WHILE STILL

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:52.774
WOMEN WHO. NEED THIS CARE AND

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.542
ARE ENTITLED TO THIS HERE. SO I

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:57.211
WILL. DEFINITELY BE VOTING FOR

01:26:57.278 --> 01:27:00.982
THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.850
MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR-

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:04.218
QUESTIONS I BELIEVE ABOUT THE

01:27:04.285 --> 01:27:05.553
AUTHOR TO HAVE TAKEN SOME

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.388
AMENDMENTS IN PUBLIC SAFETY TO

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:09.023
REDUCE THE CRIME SOIF I'M NOT

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:12.594
MISTAKEN. SO SO WITH THAT I DO

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:13.728
BELIEVE THAT THE MEASURE IS

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:16.230
NARROWLY TAILORED AND- THERE IS

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:16.931
A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:18.833
INTERESTS AND THAT WHICH I NOTE

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.235
A DRAWS SO WITH THAT- WOULD YOU

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:22.670
LIKE TO CLIP WHICH I COULD

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.472

01:27:27.008 --> 01:27:28.242
FIRST AMENDMENT IS SOMETHING I

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:29.077
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT I BELIEVE

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:30.378
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:31.179
ONE THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED

01:27:31.245 --> 01:27:32.313

02:27:04.081 --> 02:27:06.450
FUNDAMENTAL WORK- LAST TIME I

OF THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:16.260
ALREADY BY THE OPPOSITION- THIS

02:27:16.327 --> 02:27:19.697
BILL. ADOPTS A OFTEN RATHER

02:27:19.764 --> 02:27:21.199
THAN AN OPT OUT AND THAT'S A

02:27:21.265 --> 02:27:23.167
FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT FROM WHAT THE

02:27:28.272 --> 02:27:30.541
I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT YOUR

02:27:33.377 --> 02:27:34.645
YOUR BILL WILL HAVE ON THE

OPERATION OF SMART SPEAKERS.

02:27:36.614 --> 02:27:38.115

02:27:38.182 --> 02:27:40.651
CONSEQUENCES AND BENEFITS FOR

02:27:40.718 --> 02:27:43.154

02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:47.325
SEEKING TO USE VOICE

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:49.093
RECOGNITION AND PUTTING

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:51.429
BARRIERS BETWEEN THEM AND- THE

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:53.431

BE CARE IN THE FALL AND THAT'S

02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:14.885
THE- BETWEEN BASIC FUNCTIONS

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:18.055

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:08.172
OF THAT ISSUE BUT IT CERTAINLY

02:29:08.239 --> 02:29:10.107

02:29:10.174 --> 02:29:12.343
IT IN MOST USE CASES OKAY AND I

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:13.711

02:31:01.786 --> 02:31:04.054
SAYS. TELEVISIONS ARE CONNECTED

02:31:04.121 --> 02:31:05.556
TELEVISIONS CANNOT RECORD

02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:07.291
PEOPLE- THEN THE REASON FOR

02:31:07.358 --> 02:31:08.292
THAT IS THE SMART SPEAKERS ARE

02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:09.794
STABLE IN THE USED IN THE HOME

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:10.861
THE HOUSTON BEDROOMS IN THE

02:31:10.928 --> 02:31:12.663
USED IN KITCHENS JUST LIKE A TV

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:14.965
IS MOUNTED. OR PROPPED UP OR

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:16.333
SITTING. IN YOUR LIVING ROOM OR

02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:17.968
IN YOUR KITCHEN SO. I ME

02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:19.603
BECAUSE- BECAUSE OF THE NATURE

02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:21.972
OF THE DEVICE- I WOULD ARGUE

02:31:22.039 --> 02:31:24.341
THAT THE- PRIVACY. PROTECTIONS

02:31:24.408 --> 02:31:26.076
THAT THE USER NEEDS. ARE

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:28.245
COMMENSURATELY GREATER- IT'S

02:31:28.312 --> 02:31:29.413
DIFFERENT THAN A KEYBOARD AND

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:30.981
TYPING IN THE KEY THE- TECH

02:31:31.048 --> 02:31:32.249
THAT INDIVIDUALS TALKING ABOUT

02:31:32.316 --> 02:31:33.851
KEYSTROKES AND SO FORTH. BUT

02:31:33.918 --> 02:31:35.186
KEYBOARDS CAN'T RECORD YOUR

02:31:35.252 --> 02:31:36.587
VOICE RECORDINGS AND SEND THEM

02:31:36.654 --> 02:31:38.322
TO THE CLOUD TO BE STORED.

02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:39.490
WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN AND

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:41.258
DISTRIBUTED. TO GOD KNOWS WHERE

02:31:41.325 --> 02:31:42.126
ALL OVER THE EARTH AND THE

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:43.127
KEYBOARDS DON'T HAVE THOSE

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:45.196
FEATURES. SO IT IS DIFFERENT

02:31:45.262 --> 02:31:46.931
BILL. THAT'S NECESSARILY SO.

02:31:46.997 --> 02:31:48.799
AGAIN IF THE- DATA IS DE

02:31:48.866 --> 02:31:50.267
IDENTIFIED THEN THERE'S NO.

02:31:50.334 --> 02:31:52.002
LIMITATION WHATSOEVER ON THE

02:31:52.069 --> 02:31:54.205
USE OF THAT. ARE A LOT OF SMART

02:31:54.271 --> 02:31:55.406
SPEAKER MANUFACTURERS ALTHOUGH

02:31:55.473 --> 02:31:56.440
NOT ALL BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE

02:31:56.507 --> 02:31:58.342
DOING THAT ALREADY. SO I THINK

02:31:58.409 --> 02:31:59.443
THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE'VE GOT

02:31:59.510 --> 02:32:01.345
THAT- FINE TUNE A LITTLE BIT

02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:03.514

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:05.082

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:05.916

MUCH APPRECIATED. IN RECENT

02:59:43.005 --> 02:59:44.507
YEARS CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE

POLITICAL SPECTRUM HAVE BECOME

02:59:45.808 --> 02:59:47.309
INCREASINGLY ALARMED ABOUT THE

02:59:47.376 --> 02:59:48.978
ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES

02:59:49.044 --> 02:59:49.712
IN MODERATING OUR POLITICAL

02:59:49.778 --> 02:59:51.347
DISCOURSE. FOR MANY

02:59:51.413 --> 02:59:52.581
PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE

02:59:52.648 --> 02:59:53.649
HORRIFIC ASSAULT ON OUR

02:59:53.716 --> 02:59:54.984
DEMOCRACY AT THE US CAPITOL

02:59:55.050 --> 02:59:56.352
EARLIER THIS YEAR. THESE

02:59:56.418 --> 02:59:58.120
CONCERNS CENTER AROUND THE ROLE

02:59:58.187 --> 02:59:59.221
THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

02:59:59.288 --> 03:00:01.357
PLAY. IN PROMOTING HATE SPEECH.

03:00:01.423 --> 03:00:03.692
DISINFORMATION CONSPIRACY

03:00:03.759 --> 03:00:05.461
THEORIES AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM.

03:00:05.528 --> 03:00:06.795
FOR OTHERS IT IS THE MYSTERY

03:00:06.862 --> 03:00:08.264
BEHIND WHY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS

03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:10.266
IN CONTENT AND NOT OTHERS ARE

03:00:10.332 --> 03:00:12.201
SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

03:00:12.268 --> 03:00:13.536
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE

03:00:13.602 --> 03:00:15.070
THERE'S GROWING CONCERN ABOUT

03:00:15.137 --> 03:00:17.173
SEVERE POLITICAL POLARIZATION.

03:00:17.239 --> 03:00:18.474
AND THE ABILITY OF A HANDFUL OF

03:00:18.541 --> 03:00:20.309
COMPANIES TO PROFOUNDLY SHAPE

03:00:20.376 --> 03:00:22.044
THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE THAT IS

03:00:22.111 --> 03:00:24.713
CENTRAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. AB

03:00:24.780 --> 03:00:25.381
FIVE EIGHT SEVEN ADDRESSES

03:00:25.447 --> 03:00:26.682
THESE CONCERNS BY REQUIRING

03:00:26.749 --> 03:00:28.050
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO SHARE

03:00:28.117 --> 03:00:29.919
BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR

03:00:29.985 --> 03:00:31.520
CONTENT MODERATION PRACTICES

03:00:31.587 --> 03:00:33.956
WITH CONSUMERS. PARTICULAR THIS

03:00:34.023 --> 03:00:35.124
BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE LARGEST

03:00:35.191 --> 03:00:36.025
AND MOST SOPHISTICATED

03:00:36.091 --> 03:00:37.993
PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE THEIR

03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:39.795
CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES.

03:00:39.862 --> 03:00:41.597
HOW DOES POLICIES ARE ENFORCED

03:00:41.664 --> 03:00:42.932
AND THE KEY METRICS AND DATA

03:00:42.998 --> 03:00:43.999
AROUND ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE

03:00:44.066 --> 03:00:46.268
POLICIES. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL

03:00:46.335 --> 03:00:47.436
DOES NOT REQUIRE THESE

03:00:47.503 --> 03:00:48.804
COMPANIES TO HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

03:00:48.871 --> 03:00:51.207
POLICIES. NOR DOES IT REQUIRE

03:00:51.273 --> 03:00:52.074
THEM TO UNDERTAKE ANY TYPE OF

03:00:52.141 --> 03:00:54.009
ENFORCEMENT. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES

03:00:54.076 --> 03:00:55.377
THEM TO BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT

03:00:55.444 --> 03:00:56.812

THEY ARE DOING TO MODERATE

03:01:00.249 --> 03:01:02.151
SPEECH ON THEIR PLATFORMS. THIS

03:01:02.218 --> 03:01:03.719
NARAL APPROACH RESPECTS THE

03:01:03.786 --> 03:01:04.486
FIRST AMENDMENT AND FEDERAL

03:01:04.553 --> 03:01:06.322

PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. IN SHORT

03:01:10.893 --> 03:01:12.061
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL

03:01:12.127 --> 03:01:13.896
MEDIA PLATFORMS TO COME CLEAN

CHARGE RESTAURANTS REPORTERS.

03:37:32.506 --> 03:37:34.107
AND STILL CHARGE CUSTOMERS

03:37:34.174 --> 03:37:34.875
EXTRA PRICE THEY CAN MAKE A

03:37:34.941 --> 03:37:36.176
DOUBLE PROFIT OFF THIS AND I

03:37:36.243 --> 03:37:37.477
WAS THERE HERE TO ANSWER THAT.

DO BOTH OF THEM AND RE DOUBLE

03:37:40.313 --> 03:37:42.716

BUSINESS WITH. WHAT THOSE FEES

03:37:48.488 --> 03:37:50.490
GO TO. BUT ULTIMATELY STILL

03:37:50.557 --> 03:37:52.225
THIS. YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE

03:37:52.292 --> 03:37:53.693
ONLY PLATFORMS ARE IMPORTED IN

03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:54.795
CONGRESS NOW THE DIGITAL AGE IN

03:37:54.861 --> 03:37:56.129
THE MODERN AGE. BUT THAT

03:37:56.196 --> 03:37:57.564
DOESN'T MEAN THAT BUSINESSES

03:37:57.631 --> 03:37:58.832
SHOULD COUPLE WE SUBMIT TO THE

03:37:58.899 --> 03:38:00.767

REMAIN IN THIS BILL I THINK ARE

03:38:15.715 --> 03:38:17.050
REALLY IMPORTANT AND ONE IS THE

03:38:17.117 --> 03:38:19.853
PROTECTION OF THE TIPS- AND THE

03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:21.188

HERE AND HAVEN'T HEARD FROM

03:39:06.933 --> 03:39:08.468
INDIVIDUALS AND SUDDENLY

03:39:08.535 --> 03:39:09.803
THEY'RE IN OPPOSITION WITHOUT A

03:39:09.870 --> 03:39:11.404
LOT OF EXPLANATION WHY SO. I

03:39:11.471 --> 03:39:12.572
WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED TO HEAR

03:39:12.639 --> 03:39:13.406
THE LATINO RESTAURANT

03:39:13.473 --> 03:39:14.641
ASSOCIATION TO SOMEBODY WHO'S

03:39:14.708 --> 03:39:16.009
BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN LATINO

03:39:16.076 --> 03:39:18.678
COMMUNITY. AND HAS A TON OF

03:39:18.745 --> 03:39:20.013
LATINO OWNED RESTAURANTS IN MY

03:39:20.080 --> 03:39:21.114
DISTRICT I THOUGHT HOW STRANGE

03:39:21.181 --> 03:39:22.215
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THEM. SO

03:39:22.282 --> 03:39:23.350
WHEN ON THE WEBSITE WHILE THEY

03:39:23.416 --> 03:39:24.951
WERE TALKING. AND I FIND THAT

03:39:25.018 --> 03:39:26.786
IN FACT THEY THEY CLAIM THAT

03:39:26.853 --> 03:39:27.821
THEIR PARTNERS ARE WALMART

03:39:27.888 --> 03:39:28.989
DOORDASH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:39:29.055 --> 03:39:33.527
GAS TEMPERATE. UTILITIES.

03:39:33.593 --> 03:39:34.928
VALERO OIL. SO IN FOR. I'M NOT

03:39:34.995 --> 03:39:36.396
SURE IF WE'RE TALKING TO

03:39:36.463 --> 03:39:37.230
RESTAURANTS AND I THINK THAT'S

03:39:37.297 --> 03:39:39.165
IMPORTANT BECAUSE- THAT IS WHAT

03:39:39.232 --> 03:39:40.767
I'VE SPENT MY TIMEDOING DURING

03:39:40.834 --> 03:39:42.035
THIS PANDEMIC IS. ACTUALLY

03:39:42.102 --> 03:39:43.270
TALKING TO THE SMALL MOM AND

03:39:43.336 --> 03:39:44.237
POP RESTAURANTS IN MY

03:39:44.304 --> 03:39:47.107
COMMUNITY. AND OVERWHELMINGLY

03:39:47.173 --> 03:39:49.042
THEY KNOW THESE ARE PROBLEMS.

03:39:49.109 --> 03:39:51.645
OVERWHELMINGLY THEY YES SUPPORT

03:39:51.711 --> 03:39:53.413
A CAP. AND IF NOT A CAP AT

03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:54.481
LEAST A TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE

03:39:54.548 --> 03:39:55.482
THEY'RE GETTING DIFFERENT

03:39:55.549 --> 03:39:57.050
STORIES FROM THE DELIVERY

03:39:57.117 --> 03:39:59.152
COMPANIES. AND THEIR CUSTOMERS

03:39:59.219 --> 03:40:00.954
AND THE DRIVERS ON WHAT EXACTLY

03:40:01.021 --> 03:40:02.589
IS HAPPENING. ANOTHER FEATURE

03:40:02.656 --> 03:40:04.958
OF THIS- AT THIS BILL THE KIND

03:40:05.025 --> 03:40:06.626
OF GUY IT WAS HARD TO SEE BUT

03:40:06.693 --> 03:40:09.296
IT ALSO PREVENTS THE CUT THE-

03:40:09.362 --> 03:40:10.864
THE COMPANIES FROM PROVIDING.

03:40:10.931 --> 03:40:12.432
ADDING THEIR OWN COST TO THE

03:40:12.499 --> 03:40:13.567
MENU ITEMS BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD

03:40:13.633 --> 03:40:16.169
THAT AS WELL YOU KNOW AS- AS

03:40:16.236 --> 03:40:16.836
THE SMALL VIETNAMESE

03:40:16.903 --> 03:40:18.939
RESTAURANT- THAT I ENJOY GOING

03:40:19.005 --> 03:40:20.140
TO SAYS YOU KNOW YOU CAN

03:40:20.206 --> 03:40:22.075
PURCHASE SPRING ROLLS FOR SEVEN

03:40:22.142 --> 03:40:22.676
NINETY NINE YET IF YOU DO IT

03:40:22.742 --> 03:40:23.944
THROUGH DOORDASH SOMEHOW THAT.

BECAME NINE NINETY NINE AND

03:40:25.178 --> 03:40:26.046
THAT'S NOT THE RESTAURANT

DOESN'T EVEN NECESSARILY KNOW

03:40:27.213 --> 03:40:29.082
THAT'S HAPPENING SO THERE ARE

03:40:29.149 --> 03:40:30.884
TRANSPARENCY ISSUES IN THIS

03:40:30.951 --> 03:40:32.919
TYPE OF THING. AND I THINK IT

03:40:32.986 --> 03:40:34.054
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR OUR

03:40:34.120 --> 03:40:35.221

YOUR FIRST QUESTION YEP IF YOU

INTERMEDIARY WITH AN EMBEDDED

WITHIN YELP I'VE BEEN WITH

03:54:39.064 --> 03:54:41.066
DANIEL. SO WHEN THEY'RE WHEN

03:54:41.133 --> 03:54:43.068
THEY'RE USING THE CALL SO WHEN

03:54:43.135 --> 03:54:44.670
YOU CALL FOR AN ORDER IS ONE

03:54:44.737 --> 03:54:45.738
NUMBER THAT MIGHT SAY POWER

03:54:45.805 --> 03:54:47.139
BANKRUPT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

03:54:47.206 --> 03:54:48.507
THAT MEANS SO THEY COULD BE

03:54:48.574 --> 03:54:50.109
TRACKING THAT ORDER AND USING

03:54:50.176 --> 03:54:51.043
THAT TRACKING THE ADJUSTER

03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:53.045
CHARGER RESTAURANT CORRECT BUT

03:54:53.112 --> 03:54:54.780
I'M THINKING AS AS A SELLER

03:54:54.847 --> 03:54:56.515
BARKING HANNAH NOTED IF MORE

03:54:56.582 --> 03:54:57.750
CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND THAT

03:54:57.817 --> 03:54:59.452
DIFFERENCE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:54:59.518 --> 03:55:00.085
POWER BY GRUBHUB MEANS OR THIS

03:55:00.152 --> 03:55:01.687
TRACKING. J. MIGHT ALTER THEIR

03:55:01.754 --> 03:55:03.289
BEHAVIOR MORE SO IN CONTACT THE

BUSINESS MORE DIRECTLY BECAUSE

03:55:04.990 --> 03:55:06.525
I THINK CONSUMERS HAVE A FAIR

03:55:06.592 --> 03:55:08.060
EXPECTATION THAT YELP IS ACTING

03:55:08.127 --> 03:55:09.462
LIKE A YELP PAGE IS ACTUALLY

03:55:09.528 --> 03:55:10.396
JUST FINDING THE CONTACT

03:55:10.463 --> 03:55:11.530
INFORMATION AND YOU ONE DOLLAR

03:55:11.597 --> 03:55:13.098

03:55:13.165 --> 03:55:15.901
INTENTION THAT YOUR BILLING THE

03:55:15.968 --> 03:55:17.236
ACT THE RESTAURANT EXTRA ON TOP

03:55:17.303 --> 03:55:18.471
OF THAT SO THAT'S WHY I THINK

03:55:18.537 --> 03:55:20.272
IS IMPORTANT SO I GET THAT I

03:55:20.339 --> 03:55:22.041
GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY SHOULD

03:55:22.107 --> 03:55:24.143
THE ABILITY OF GRUBHUB TO

03:55:24.210 --> 03:55:26.011
CHARGE DEPEND UPON KIND OF THE

03:55:26.078 --> 03:55:27.680
ARBITRARY FACT OF WHETHER THAT.

03:55:27.746 --> 03:55:33.118
THE CUSTOMERS ENDS. UP PLACING

03:55:33.185 --> 03:55:34.587
THE ORDER NOT. I THINK THAT'S

03:55:34.653 --> 03:55:35.988
ACCESS QUESTION. WILL BILLS NOT

03:55:36.055 --> 03:55:36.889
TO EXTERRAN THEIR BUSINESS BUT

03:55:36.956 --> 03:55:37.756

TO FIND RESTAURANTS SO. WHILE

03:58:18.651 --> 03:58:19.385
IT IS PART OF THE CONTRACT AND

03:58:19.451 --> 03:58:20.386

RESTAURANTS ENTRANCE TO WHEN

03:58:21.420 --> 03:58:22.554
THEY TRY TO YOU KNOW COMPETE

03:58:22.621 --> 03:58:24.923
THEM. THE ONLINE MARKET PLACE

03:58:24.990 --> 03:58:25.524
IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO

03:58:25.591 --> 03:58:27.159
THEM BY THE SAME TIME. IT'S A

03:58:27.226 --> 03:58:29.495
CALLED A MARKETING. THREE ARE

STRETCH BECAUSE YELP IS THE

03:58:31.697 --> 03:58:32.998
PLATFORM THAT DOES THE LISTING

03:58:33.065 --> 03:58:34.767
IN THE MARKETING. GRUBHUB IS

03:58:34.833 --> 03:58:35.834
JUST KINDA INTERMEDIARY

03:58:35.901 --> 03:58:37.803
SERVICE. SO WHY DOES GOPIS

03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:39.104
THEIR NUMBER AS OPPOSED TO THE

03:58:39.171 --> 03:58:40.172
REST OF SOMEBODY'S IT DESCRIBED

03:58:40.239 --> 03:58:44.143
LIKE MAKE IT EASIER. FOR THEM

03:58:44.209 --> 03:58:44.777
TO ABROGATE ALL THESE NUMBERS.

03:58:44.843 --> 03:58:46.045
THAT WOULD BE A VERY YELP. HAVE

03:58:46.111 --> 03:58:47.713
LIGHTED HE'S FOR. BUT I MEAN

03:58:47.780 --> 03:58:50.716

AND HIS TAX SYSTEM THEN YOU CAN

03:58:58.223 --> 03:58:59.825
MAKE MORE MONEY BUT- IF IT IS A

03:58:59.892 --> 03:59:01.226
GOOD QUESTION FORGET WHY THEY

03:59:01.293 --> 03:59:04.630
HAVE TO HAVE AN INTERMEDIARY.

03:59:04.697 --> 03:59:05.998
AND YOU HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH

03:59:06.065 --> 03:59:07.833
YELP. IF THAT MAKES IT EASIER

03:59:07.900 --> 03:59:09.568
TO UNDERSTAND OR NOT IT IS IT

03:59:09.635 --> 03:59:10.169
IS SOMETHING THAT WE WORK ON

03:59:10.235 --> 03:59:12.404
TOGETHER. OKAY I'M JUST TRYING

03:59:12.471 --> 03:59:12.971
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

03:59:13.038 --> 03:59:13.906
PROHIBITING A PRACTICE THAT

03:59:13.972 --> 03:59:15.474
ACTUALLY ADDS VALUE FOR

03:59:15.541 --> 03:59:16.642
CONSUMERS LIKE IF. YOU KNOW

03:59:16.709 --> 03:59:17.710
THAT. YOU HAVE THESE

03:59:17.776 --> 03:59:18.577
PARTNERSHIPS THAT ACTUALLY

03:59:18.644 --> 03:59:19.945
PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH EASIER

03:59:20.012 --> 03:59:21.246
ACCESS TO THE PHONE NUMBERS

03:59:21.313 --> 03:59:23.582
THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE-

03:59:23.649 --> 03:59:25.484
AND I'M- A LITTLE WORRIED THAT

03:59:25.551 --> 03:59:26.218
ANYTIME YOU INTERFERE WITH

03:59:26.285 --> 03:59:28.053
VOLUNTARY. ARRANGEMENTS LIKE

03:59:28.120 --> 03:59:31.457
THIS MAYBE WILL BE. UNDERMINING

03:59:31.523 --> 03:59:33.425
CONSUMER WELFARE AND THAT WAY.

03:59:33.492 --> 03:59:35.627
MR CUNNINGHAM FOLLOWED BY

03:59:35.694 --> 03:59:37.429
MISTER BENNETT YEAH THIS THIS

03:59:37.496 --> 03:59:38.263
MIGHT BE KIND OF A DUMB

03:59:38.330 --> 03:59:40.632
QUESTION BUT THAT DOES THIS

03:59:40.699 --> 03:59:43.335

SEEM TO DO ALL TIME BUT AS MANY

03:59:51.343 --> 03:59:53.378
PEOPLE I JUST GO ON GRUBHUB'S

03:59:53.445 --> 03:59:54.980

IS THE MOST COMMON LISTING

04:00:00.619 --> 04:00:02.287
SERVICE SO AS WE DEFINE THE

04:00:02.354 --> 04:00:02.988
BILL WE TALK ABOUT THE LISTING

04:00:03.055 --> 04:00:04.857

FULFILLMENT- AND IT'S HARD TO

TECHNICALLY DELIVER THE FOOD

04:00:12.798 --> 04:00:13.565

THERE IN THE MIDDLE AND THIS

04:00:15.100 --> 04:00:17.002
BILL IS SIMPLY TO CLARIFY THAT

THERE SHOULDN'T BE. A

04:00:18.971 --> 04:00:20.105
MISLEADING PHONE NUMBER BECAUSE

04:00:20.172 --> 04:00:21.573
IN THE PAST THIS IS A RECENT

04:00:21.640 --> 04:00:23.408
DEVELOPMENT GROWTH GRUB GRUB

04:00:23.475 --> 04:00:24.576

WITH DIFFERENT NUMBER BECAUSE

04:00:32.818 --> 04:00:34.486
ARE USING THAT TO TRACK AND NOW

04:00:34.553 --> 04:00:35.687
IT SEEMS THEY ARE USING THE

04:00:35.754 --> 04:00:37.122
SAME NUMBER BUT IS VERY

04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.756
DIFFICULT TO DISCERN WHAT IS

04:00:37.823 --> 04:00:39.324
HAPPENING STILL SO THAT'S

04:00:39.391 --> 04:00:40.459

RESTAURANT. SO WHAT HAPPENED

THIS A GLASS KNOWN AS RAJENDRA.

04:01:08.554 --> 04:01:10.322
HISTORICALLY THE- CALL BECAUSE

04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.889
IT GOT ROUTE AND AFTER. BIG

04:01:10.956 --> 04:01:13.258
STILL. THE RESTAURANT EVEN IF

04:01:13.325 --> 04:01:13.959
IT DID NOT RESULT IN ORDER

04:01:14.026 --> 04:01:15.727
BECAUSE THEY'RE CLAIMING. THAT

04:01:15.794 --> 04:01:17.262
THEY'RE GIVING GENERATING LEADS

04:01:17.329 --> 04:01:18.764
FOR THEM. WHEN IN FACT YOU GO

04:01:18.831 --> 04:01:20.566
ON. THE YELP WEBSITE TO FIND

04:01:20.632 --> 04:01:23.702
IT'S NOT LIKE GRUBHUB PROVIDED

04:01:23.769 --> 04:01:24.670
LEAVE INTEREST WAS THE SERVICE.

04:01:24.736 --> 04:01:27.406
OKAY I THINK I THINK THAT

04:01:27.472 --> 04:01:29.374
CLARIFIES IT YEAH THANK.

04:01:29.441 --> 04:01:30.876
CERTAINLY NOT SUPER INTUITIVE

04:01:30.943 --> 04:01:32.344
AS AS I HAVE COME TO LEARN TO

04:01:32.411 --> 04:01:32.945
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

04:01:33.011 --> 04:01:34.980
INTERESTING PRACTICES THAT WERE

04:01:35.047 --> 04:01:38.784
NEGATIVE MISTER BENNETT. YEAH I

04:01:38.851 --> 04:01:39.318
WOULD JUST LIKE TO PUT IN

04:01:39.384 --> 04:01:42.688
PERSPECTIVE THAT- TO A LARGE

04:01:42.754 --> 04:01:43.655
EXTENT THIS IS AN ISSUE OF

04:01:43.722 --> 04:01:45.557
COMPETITION. AND THERE IS

04:01:45.624 --> 04:01:47.392
INSUFFICIENT COMPETITION IN THE

04:01:47.459 --> 04:01:49.094
MARKETPLACE AND SO THE SMALL

04:01:49.161 --> 04:01:51.997
RESTAURANT. IS DOESN'T HAVE THE

04:01:52.064 --> 04:01:54.266
OPTION OF HAVING A NUMBER OF

04:01:54.333 --> 04:01:55.634
DIFFERENT PLACES THEY COULD GO

04:01:55.701 --> 04:01:57.636
AND- HAVE THAT COMPETITION AND

04:01:57.703 --> 04:02:00.405
DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE- MAKE SURE

04:02:00.472 --> 04:02:01.240
THAT THEY'RE BEING TREATED

04:02:01.306 --> 04:02:03.242
FAIRLY X. CENTER. AND WE'RE

04:02:03.308 --> 04:02:05.344
GOING TO BE CONSTANTLY CHANGING

04:02:05.410 --> 04:02:06.345
THE FACT THAT THERE'S

04:02:06.411 --> 04:02:07.379
INSUFFICIENT COMPETITION

04:02:07.446 --> 04:02:09.581
BECAUSE- THE ANTI TRUST LAWS IN

04:02:09.648 --> 04:02:11.016
THE APPLICATION OF ALL THOSE IS

04:02:11.083 --> 04:02:13.185
VERY SLOW AND CUMBERSOME. AND

04:02:13.252 --> 04:02:14.920
THIS TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING SO

04:02:14.987 --> 04:02:18.156
FAST I MEAN. MOST OF US AS AS

04:02:18.223 --> 04:02:19.558
AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTED

04:02:19.625 --> 04:02:20.792
OUT TO A LAST NIGHT SHE WASN'T

04:02:20.859 --> 04:02:22.828
EVEN AWARE OF THIS RIGHT SO-

04:02:22.895 --> 04:02:24.363
THIS IS OFF THE RADAR SCREEN

04:02:24.429 --> 04:02:26.832
AND SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. TO

04:02:26.899 --> 04:02:30.535
TRY TO ADDRESS ONE. RELATIVELY

04:02:30.602 --> 04:02:32.571
SMALL PART OF INADEQUATE

04:02:32.638 --> 04:02:33.906
COMPETITION AND WHAT WE ARE

04:02:33.972 --> 04:02:35.941
SEEING IN THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD

04:02:36.008 --> 04:02:39.511
AS- THE THERE'S A CONSTANT

04:02:39.578 --> 04:02:40.245
ATTEMPT TO BUY OUT YOUR

04:02:40.312 --> 04:02:42.180
COMPETITORS. WERE PARTNER UP

04:02:42.247 --> 04:02:44.616
WITH YOUR COMPETITORS SO THAT

04:02:44.683 --> 04:02:46.218
YOU DON'T HAVE THIS COMPETITION

04:02:46.285 --> 04:02:47.586
EVER INVOLVED AND SO I THINK

04:02:47.653 --> 04:02:48.620
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ALWAYS

04:02:48.687 --> 04:02:50.756
BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND

04:02:50.822 --> 04:02:52.858
REALLY HAVE THE TO HAVE THESE

04:02:52.925 --> 04:02:54.059
KIND OF BILLS AND ACTIONS TO

04:02:54.126 --> 04:02:56.495
BE. A WAY OF TO BE ON NOTICE

04:02:56.561 --> 04:02:58.530
THAT YOU CAN'T. ABUSE YOUR

04:02:58.597 --> 04:03:00.732
MONOPOLISTIC POSITION IN THE

04:03:00.799 --> 04:03:02.167
MARKET PLACE YOU HAVE YOU

04:03:02.234 --> 04:03:04.569
SHOULD BE PROACTIVELY. FAIR

04:03:04.636 --> 04:03:05.570
WITH THE SMALL RESTAURANT AND

04:03:05.637 --> 04:03:07.172
SAY OKAY IF YOU DIDN'T GET AN

04:03:07.239 --> 04:03:08.006
ORDER WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO

IT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE I THINK

04:25:22.306 --> 04:25:24.575
I WOULD HAVE TO COME DOWN. A

04:25:24.642 --> 04:25:25.342
LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THOUGH THAN

04:25:25.409 --> 04:25:26.877
SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS-

04:25:26.944 --> 04:25:27.778
