FRAMEWORK THE UPCOMING I THINK

I THINK. THE LEGISLATION WILL

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.666
PROBABLY BE TAKEN UP POST

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:12.503
ELECTION I WOULD IMAGINE SO

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:14.271
IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:17.040
IS THERE SERVE HAVING THE FIELD

00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:18.842
HEARINGS GETTING READY- WOULD

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:21.778
THEY HAVE A IN CALIFORNIA ON

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.347
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:25.048
FRAMEWORK FOR I THINK THERE'S A

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.451
REASONABLY GOOD CHANCE AND- IN

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:28.886
FACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.120
CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:31.522
MEMBERS ON THE TEAM AND I CAN

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:33.357
READ- CHAIRMAN DEFAULT WHO HAS

00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:35.559
VISITED ON VISIT ORANGE COUNTY-

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:37.060
AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:41.198
STATE- WE ARE MEETING WITH HIS

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:41.765
STAFF AND WILL ENCOURAGE HIM

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.800
TO. TO DO A FEW MORE IN

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:45.802
CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN I THINK

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:46.503
THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.438
DELEGATIONS WELL PLACED AND

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:50.274
WELL POSITIONED TO. ADVOCATE

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.375
FOR THE STATE'S NEEDS SINCE

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:52.709
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF THEM

00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:54.711
ON THE COMMITTEE RIGHT I YEAH I

00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:56.680
HOPE THAT WE CAN GET. SOME

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.549
FIELD HEARINGS BECAUSE- IT

00:46:58.615 --> 00:47:01.518
SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THE FEDERAL

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:03.954
GOVERNMENT TO HOME. IS GOING TO

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.822
BE A PARTNER THE OUGHT TO KEEP

00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:09.293
PACE WITH THE FUNDING. THAT

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:12.362
WE'VE DONE WITH SP ONE SO IF

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.997
THEY FALL BEHIND THAT JUST

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:16.433
DIMINISHES OUR EFFORT WITH SB

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.901
ONE CORRECT RIGHT RIGHT AND AS

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.536
YOUKNOW THE PERENNIAL QUESTION

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:21.405
WASHINGTON IS HOW TO PAY FOR. A

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:24.408
LARGE RIGHT PROGRAM THERE IS NO

00:47:24.474 --> 00:47:26.276
SUCH CONSENSUS YET WHETHER IT'S

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.678
INCREASING THE GAS TAX

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:29.513
INDUCTING INDEXING IT USING

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.714
SOME MORE OTHER FORMER FINANCE

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:31.582
SO THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.350
YET BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE A

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:36.019
FRAMEWORK A PROPOSED AND THE

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:36.954
QUESTION BEFORE THEM IS HOW DO

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.290
YOU PAY FOR IT. OKAY SIR SKIN

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:41.959
ANSWER BATES. CAN WE GO BACK TO

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:43.227
THE JUDGE. FIRST QUESTION

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:45.262
BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD OUR INITIAL

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:47.564
HEARINGS ON SP ONE WE

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:48.665
IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:50.867
SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:52.936
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WE'VE COME

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:54.671
UP WITH FIFTY FOUR WE SORT OF

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:56.173
DRIFTED DOWN SAID LET'S PUT

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.641
DOCTOR IN THERE. SO WHAT ABOUT

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:59.476
THE REST OF IT YOU KNOW IN TEN

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:01.845
YEARS HOW ABOUT THE OTHER

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:02.713
EIGHTY THREE BILLION THAT WE

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:05.215
ONCE UPON A TIME. IDENTIFIED

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:08.185
IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN SB ONE

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:10.854
WHAT ABOUT THAT. QUESTION

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:13.590
QUESTION CENTER AND AS I THINK

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:14.224
EVERYBODY IN THE TRANSPORTATION

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:16.727
WORLD KNOWS JUST BE ONE WAS A

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:17.561
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT DOWN

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:19.396
PAYMENT IT DOESN'T COVER ALL

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:20.664
THE NEEDS AND SO WITH THE

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.933
AVAILABLE FUNDING WE HAVE- IT'S

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.668
REALLY POOR TO TAKE A RISK

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.137
BASED APPROACH- TO ADD ON A

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:30.007
DRESS THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:31.341
WHETHER IT'S ON PURPOSE

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:33.877
CORPORATE. TOTALS AND WE'RE

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.445
GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT OTHERS AND-

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:38.115
THAT'S THE TO TELL TO FROM US.

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:39.449
TURKEY WE SUFFER GOT TECH

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:42.586
GRADUATE YOU ALSO FOR YOUR

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:44.288
APPOINTMENT. HOW ABOUT FROM SEA

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:48.058
TO SEA OUR PERSPECTIVE. WELL I

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:49.126
THINK SECRETARY KIM WAS EXACTLY

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:50.961
RIGHT- WE IDENTIFY AS YOU

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:52.596
POINTED OUT WE IDENTIFIED A

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:54.831
NEED THAT WAS EVEN LARGER THAN

00:48:54.898 --> 00:48:57.467
SB ONE WE CAN ONLY DO WHAT WE

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.469
HAVE FUNDING FOR. I'M NOT A

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:03.106
CHECK. CLIMATE RESILIENCY

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:06.977
ADAPTATION AND FIX THE FIRST

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.812
ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THEY MAY

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:13.016
HAVE BE. COMPETING FORCES

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:15.886
BECAUSE SOME OF THE ADAPTATION

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:18.188
EFFORTS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE WE

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:19.756
JUST DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.224
WHAT THE TRANSPORTATION PEOPLE

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.994
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FLOOD

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:25.896
CONTROL PEOPLE WE NEED TO TALK

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:26.963
ABOUT WITH THE CLIMATE PEOPLE

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.999
WHAT ARE THE OTHER FACTORS THAT

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:32.436
ARE HAPPENING THAT ME EXPAND HE

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:34.371
THE LIFE OF SOME OF OUR ROADS

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:36.473
IN IT IN A DISTRESSED AREA WERE

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.242
THAT. FOR A SHORTENED THEM IF

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:40.310
WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ON

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:44.047
ADAPTATION SO MY QUESTION IS

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:46.316
THAT. DO YOU CAN THINK OF PARTS

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:48.485
OF HIGHWAY ONE WHEN WE KNOW IF

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:49.820
WITH SEALEVEL RISE ARE GOING TO

00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:52.356
BE UNDER WATER. SO WHAT IS YOUR

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:55.158
THINKING DO IF NOTHING HAPPENS

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:56.860
THE OTHER SOME EXTERNAL THESE

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:59.196
THAT ARE GOING I'M WERE CHANGES

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:00.197
ARE BEING MADE ON ALAMEDA

00:50:00.263 --> 00:50:02.466
CREEK. MITIGATE UP TO ONE THIRD

00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:04.501
OF SEA LEVEL RISE WHEN DO YOU

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:06.770
GUYS GET THAT INFORMATION THAT

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:09.172
WOULD HELP YOU WHAT YOU'RE

00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:10.741
PLANNING ON WHETHER WE ASK.

00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:13.009
SURFACE R- PROPOSAL OF A

00:50:13.076 --> 00:50:16.313
DIFFERENT HOUSE HAD ALL GET

CALTRANS HAS BEEN DOING ITS OF

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.755
ASSESSMENTS. THE CHALLENGE IS

00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:27.791
HOW TO PAY FOR UP PROJECTS THAT

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:30.093
INCREASE THE RESILIENCY OF A

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.996
TRANSPORTATION ASSET. I BELIEVE

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:34.965
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN SB ONE DID

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:38.402
HAVE A PROGRAM FOR THAT PURPOSE

00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:39.836
AND IT MAY HAVE IT MAY HAVE

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:42.205
BEEN LAST FOR A COUPLE YEARS-

00:50:42.272 --> 00:50:44.174
THERE NEEDS TO BE ADDITIONAL-

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:47.310
WAYS TO COVER THAT- THAT'S

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.178

U. S. SENATE BILL SO THAT'S

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:57.320
GONNA BE THE CHALLENGE GOING

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:58.955
FORWARD HOW DO WE COVER THE

00:50:59.022 --> 00:50:59.890
COST TO MAKE THESE PROP

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:02.359
PERSONALLY. AND WITHOUT THE

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:02.959

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:19.943

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:34.057
OF WORK THAT WAS ALREADY

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:37.127

DEPUTATION PLANS IT SO WHAT WE

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:02.052

IMPLEMENT THAT. BUT THE BOTTOM

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:41.624
LINE IS THAT'S A OF MONEY BUT

SAY ON YOUR QUESTION IS THAT-

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:52.635
PAST PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO FIND

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:56.339
THINGS SO. THE PAY AS THEY GO

00:57:56.406 --> 00:58:03.012
ALONG. AND WHAT THAT ENTAILS IS.

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:04.747
ALL THESE DIFFERENT PHASES

00:58:04.814 --> 00:58:05.748
RIGHT LIKE ARE PART PROJECT

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.851
RIGHT TO SAN JOSE ALL THESE

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:10.820
DIFFERENT PHASES AND YOU HAVE

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:13.423
TO DO THREE FOR A OURS THREE OR

00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:14.891
FOUR AND DURING PLANS ROUTE

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:18.394
YEAH SO. THE WHOLE IDEA OF

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.263
MULTI YEAR FUNDING SHOLD BE

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.700
APPROACHED WE DID SB NINE A FEW

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.001
YEARS AGO IT ALLOWED. THE

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:27.070
TRANSIT FUNDS TO BE MULTI YEAR

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.906
GRANTS. AND I THINK THAT'S A

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.741
GOOD DIRECTION THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:34.077
EXPLORED MORE. IT WHETHER OR

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:35.411
NOT THAT'S A GOOD DIRECTION

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:36.980
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:39.549
HAVING THIS FASTER. YOU KNOW

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:42.652
THIS SO. FEDERAL FRAMEWORK-

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:44.888
PROPOSAL WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:47.023
LIKE SERVE HOW WE PLAN AND BILL

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:50.460
PROJECTS MULTI YEAR FUNDING.

00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:54.097
AND DEVELOP A MULTI YEAR PLAN.

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:56.266
LIKE FEDERAL NEWS STARTS

00:58:56.332 --> 00:58:57.967
PROGRAM USED TO DO I MEAN THEY

00:58:58.034 --> 00:59:00.436
STILL DO IT RIGHT YES IF SO-

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:03.139
WHEN WE WHEN WE DEVELOP THAT.

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:04.908
SB NINE. THE WAS SOMETHING THAT

00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:06.309
WE MODELED AFTER THE NEW

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.945
STARTS. KANEMOTO YOUR BUT THIS

00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:11.714
A CONTRACT IF YOU HAVE TO SPEND

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:13.716
THE MONEY AT CERTAIN DATE. THIS

00:59:13.783 --> 00:59:14.684
ONLY WE CAN BUILD THE THOSE

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:16.419
KINDS OF PROJECTS I THINK SO I

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:18.187
THINK ITHINK THAT WOULD BE A

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:20.123
GOOD MODEL FOR WHAT SENATOR

00:59:20.189 --> 00:59:23.226
WHITE HOUSE HE'S TALKING ABOUT

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:24.160
THESE BIGGER SCALE. PROJECTS

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:24.761
THAT MIGHT INVOLVE MANY

00:59:24.827 --> 00:59:26.362
DIFFERENT SOURCES OF MY- MY IN

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:29.332
A FOUR FIVE. SINCE WE HAVE THE

CHAIR THAT WOULD BE THE PART

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:34.871
SANTA CLARA. SHOULD WE GET TO

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:38.608
THE END OF THE- OF THE CYCLE IN

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:40.376

01:08:17.092 --> 01:08:18.561
THAT THAT THIS IS A PROJECT

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.796
THAT THAT'LL LOCAL AREA AND

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.298
THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WANTS

01:08:22.364 --> 01:08:24.166
SO HOPEFULLY BY HAVING SUCH A

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.769
PROCESS WE WOULD- AVOID. SOME

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.671
THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:31.040
FACING. ONE THING ALSO THROW IN

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:31.974
ONE OF THE THINGS WHERE WE'RE

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.476
LOOKING AT DOING IN THIS NEXT

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:37.346
CYCLE- IS- PILOTING A COUPLE OF

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:38.280
WHAT THEY CALL QUICK BUILD

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:39.448
PROGRAMS FOR THE ACTOR

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:40.616
TRANSPORTATION FROM DONE A

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:42.785
NUMBER OF THESE IN THE SAN JOSE

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.920
AREA. BUT THEY'VE DONE A COUPLE

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:48.791
OF. THROUGHOUT AND ALLOW IS A

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.025
CITY OR COUNTY TO GO TO GO AND

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:51.694
DO SOMETHING IT'S NOT GOING TO

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.461
BE PERMANENT IT CAN BE

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:54.630
CHANGEABLE. MAYBE IT MIGHT LAST

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:57.366
YOUR A COUPLE YEARS AND GET

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:59.168
MADE PERMANENT. IF IT'S

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:01.203
SUCCESSFUL BUT IT ALLOWS PEOPLE

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.771
TO LOOK AT WHAT THE RESULT THAT

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.273
MIGHT BE SO WITH THAT AREAS

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.342
WERE. INITIALLY BEEN. OUT FOR

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:11.981
EXAMPLE. BURKE AND BUSINESSES

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:13.749
SO BIZ DON'T WANT TO LOOSE

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.018
PARKING FOR A BI WEEKLY. BUT

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:16.585
WHEN THEY GET GET THE ACTOR

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:17.186
TRANSPORTATION. THEY FIND THAT

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:19.622
I HAS. IN CUSTOMERS SO THAT'S A

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:22.424
QUICK BUILD PILOT HAS ALLOWED

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:23.559
WOULD ALLOW SOMEOF THOSE TO

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.127
TRY IT. TO SEE IF IT WORKS

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:26.462
WE'RE NOT INVESTING AS MUCH

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.763
MONEY MAKING PERMITS. AND IF WE

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.598
FIND IT ISN'T SUCCESSFUL THEN

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:32.034
WE CAN GO JUST TO. ANSWER THE

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:32.835
QUESTION WHAT WOULD MAKE IT

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:35.404
SUCCESSFUL. I UNDERSTOOD

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.906
HOWEVER THAT. ARE TO BE

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:39.542
ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING FUNDS ON

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:41.477
SOME OF THESE TWO HAD TO HAVE

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:44.480
THAT AS A COMPONENT OF THE-

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:48.384
JEFF. I DON'T KNOW IF. THE ACT.

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.185

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.564
LOW ROSA THEY HAVE TO SOME

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.365
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:05.067
OR THEY'RE NOT HIGH ON THE LIST

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:07.236
OF PRIVATIZATION FOR MATCHING

FUNDS YEAH I JUST SAY TAKE A

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:09.972
LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.575
TO BE ALMOST COMPETING.

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.610
INTERESTS THERE SURE AND OUR

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:16.111

IT FUNDS A WIDE VARIETY OF

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:21.850
PROJECTS- IT DOES NOT THE

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:22.618
REQUIREMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:26.288

THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS- WE

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.608

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:48.210

OUR BUT I THINK WHAT WE WANT IS

01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:10.343
PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO BROAD.

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.045
WELL MY POINT IS MAYBE A LITTLE

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:13.380
BROAD BUT MY WHAT I'M GETTING

01:49:13.446 --> 01:49:15.115
AT HERE IS THAT I'VE I'VE HEARD

01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:16.917
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT SB ONE

01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:18.451
ALLOWS US TO DO BUT I'VE NOT

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:20.053

ACTUALLY THERE BEFORE. BECAUSE

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:25.392
THEY'RE MORE BROAD SO FOR ME I

01:49:25.458 --> 01:49:26.660
WANT TO LOOK AT THE ABILITY

01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:28.929

01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:31.164

01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:32.799
I THINK ON SB ONE. ART IS

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:34.634
HELPFUL US AS THE OTHER PARTS

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:36.069

01:49:52.686 --> 01:49:55.956
CHART IN MY OFFICE. SO THE

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:57.290
SHOWS THE TRANSPORTATION

01:49:57.357 --> 01:50:01.161
FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. IT IT'S

ABOUT FOUR FEET WIDE BY ABOUT

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:07.400
FIVE FEET LONG. URGED BUT- BUT

01:50:07.467 --> 01:50:09.135
A SEPARATE I CAN SIMPLIFY IT

THERE THERE'S- LOCAL GAS TAX

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:13.840
FROM THE STATE AND THEN THERE'S

01:50:13.907 --> 01:50:15.909
A FEDERAL GAS TAX THAT'S BEEN

01:50:15.976 --> 01:50:19.779
HISTORICAL WE GET. ONE POT

MONEY WE ALSO GET DIESEL FUEL

01:50:22.015 --> 01:50:27.721
TAXES WE GET TO A- REVENUE FROM

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:29.823
MAYBE SOME OTHER SOURCES THE

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:33.059
LOCAL SELF HELP COUNTIES THERE

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:35.362
POTS OF MONEY- OF. MONEY

01:50:38.698 --> 01:50:40.600
HIGHWAY COUNTY. THE COUNTY WANT

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:43.103
TO LOOK AT YOUR YOUR QUESTION

01:50:43.169 --> 01:50:46.606
CHARLIE OF IS REGARDING STATE I

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:48.608
WOULD CAL STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:52.712
ALLOCATED TO. GENERALLY THINGS

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:54.881
OF STILL UP PROJECTS THAT'S A

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:57.650
NEW ONE NEW PROJECT- WIDENING

01:50:57.717 --> 01:50:59.252
OR AN INTERCHANGE OR SOMETHING

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:00.420
LIKE THAT THEN YOU HAVE THE

01:51:00.487 --> 01:51:04.124
SHOP. SHOP IS THE ROAD MAY KNOW

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:06.826
A ROAD REPAIRS AND THEN JUST RE

01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:14.434
SO THOSE ARE THE- THOSE ARE THE

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:15.802
THREE. SOME MONEY NOW THE STEP

01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:19.606
PROJECTS THE THERE'S BEEN LESS

01:51:19.672 --> 01:51:21.708
AND LESS EACH YEAR OKAY THE

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:24.010
REASON WHY IS BECAUSE MORE AND

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:26.246
MORE HAD TO BE SPENT ON. THE

01:51:26.312 --> 01:51:28.615
SHOP IN THE MAINTENANCE PART

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:32.419
HIGHWAY NOW THE GAS TAX ALSO

01:51:32.485 --> 01:51:35.522

FORMAL IT GOES TO THE CITIES

01:51:45.765 --> 01:51:47.367
THE GAS TAX IS GOVERNED BY

01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:48.835
ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:49.702
CONSTITUTION COULD ALWAYS BEEN

01:51:49.769 --> 01:51:52.572
A ROAD ROAD TRIP FOR TATIAN A

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:54.641
REPAIR THERE'S- ARTICLE IN THE

01:51:54.707 --> 01:51:56.810
STATE CONSTITUTION SO THE MONEY

01:51:56.876 --> 01:52:00.180

OF THAT'S WHERE THE GAS TAX

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:20.900

02:00:26.953 --> 02:00:29.322
ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE SB ONE

02:00:29.388 --> 02:00:31.023
IS- IMPLEMENTED IN THE MOST

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:32.358
EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY

02:00:32.425 --> 02:00:34.327

ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:44.570
MEASURES WHICH WE'VE TALKED

02:00:44.637 --> 02:00:46.439
ABOUT AT LENGTH AFTERNOON WE

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:47.807
THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:49.542
IMPROVEMENT AND THAT'S WHY WE

02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:51.377
HAVE- STARTED TO WORK WITH.

02:00:51.444 --> 02:00:53.346
SUGGESTED BILL PROPOSED THAT

02:00:53.412 --> 02:00:55.181
WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:57.817
ACCOUNTABILITY- ESSENTIALLY

02:00:57.883 --> 02:00:59.218
WHAT WE'VE CONCLUDED AT IS A

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:01.487
TRANSPORTATION POLICY PERCENT I

02:01:01.554 --> 02:01:03.255
KNOW WHERE ALL THE NUMBERS ARE

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:04.490
I CAN DO SOME RESEARCH AND

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:05.625
FIGURE OUT WHAT SB ONE IS

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:07.326
FUNDING. BUT FOR THE AVERAGE

02:01:07.393 --> 02:01:09.428
PERSON- SOMEONE IN THE MEDIA.

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:11.063
THAT INFORMATION IS NOT AS

02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:12.565
READILY AVAILABLE AS WE THINK

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:15.134
IT SHOULD BE. AT SO OUR IDEAS

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:16.535
THAT WE WOULD ASK THE STATE TO

02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:18.571
USE EXISTING SB ONE DATA AND

02:01:18.638 --> 02:01:20.806
PROD HIM FOR TEN YEARS EXISTING

THE IMPACTS OF SB ONE AND-

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:30.383

02:01:30.449 --> 02:01:33.619
WOULD. THAT MAKE THIS AFTERNOON

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:34.887

THEY FILL UP AT THE PUMP IS

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:41.794
GETTING. INSTEAD THE BENEFIT

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:43.529
