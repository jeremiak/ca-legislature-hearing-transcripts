NUMBER SIX TO ORDER. AND WE'RE GONNA ASK MISTER OBERNOLTE TO PRESENT HIS -- FIRST TWO BILLS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I GUESS MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. I'LL PRESENT FIRST ON A CA ELEVEN I'M SURE WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE GOOD WORK THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE DOES IN ASSISTING THE LEGISLATURE AND FOR FISCALLY -- A FISCALLY IMPACTFUL BILLS A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THE LA WHO IS -- SHARES A BUDGET WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE PROP ONE FORTY WAS PASSED. BY THE VOTERS. THE LEGISLATURE WAS COME FORCED TO COMPETE WITH RESOURCES WITH THE LA ALL HIGH AT THAT TIME THE STAFF OF THE LA -- WAS CUT BY OVER 60% AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN RESTORED. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW DIRE THAT SITUATION HAS BECOME THE ONLY -- CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF ANALYSTS AS THEY HAD BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THAT THE SIZE OF THE STATE BUDGET. HAS GROWN BY OVER FIFTY TIMES OR OVER 5000% SINCE THEN AND ARE CONSEQUENTLY THE NUMBER PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE OVERSIGHT HAS ALSO GROWN SO. WE WOULDLIKE TO SEE THE LA YOU'LL BE ABLETO GET BACK TO THE POINT. WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY IN PROP ONE FORTY WHERE THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING FISCAL ANALYSIS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE BILLS THAT WERE IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE? THEY'RE MEANT TO BE THE COUNTER WEIGHT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AS SUCH -- I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO RESOURCES TO DO THEIR JOB SO ACA. ELEVEN WOULD AMEND THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO MOVE THE LA -- OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE CAP OF PROP. ONE FORTY BUT TO BE CLEAR -- NORMALLY I'M IN FAVOR OF SMALLER GOVERNMENT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE AGENCY THAT'S TASKED WITH BEING THE WATCHED OGLE FOR STATE SPENDING. AND ADVISING THE LEGISLATURE ON MAKING GOOD FISCAL DECISIONS -- THAT AGENCY I WANT TO HAVE ALL OF THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DO THEIR JOB SO MUCH CHAIR LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR JOINT AUTHORED THIS BILL WITH ME AND I REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON A SCALE OF A THANK YOU. FINANCE HI GOOD AFTERNOON A DOLLY EDITOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE AN APPROVED POSITION ON THIS MEASURE -- BUT WOULD NOTE THAT -- THAT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE GENERAL FUND COST PRESSURES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE LA L.. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL INCUR ONE TIME COSTS TO PUT THIS MEASURE ON THE BALLOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I JUST A QUICK QUESTION -- TO TOWARD VICE CHAIR -- BUT ROUGHLY. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE ROUGH NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FOR FINANCE VERSES THE ROUGH NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FOR LAND DO YOU RECOLLECT -- OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT ANSWER BUT IT'S IT'S MANY TIMES THE DEAL OF HAS MANY TIMES MORE ANALYSTS THAN THE LA OR DOES. FIVE FINANCED YOU HAVE THE NUMBER OF A FINE IT'S WELL WE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS ARE. SO IS JUST JUST. TO ONE FORTY EIGHT SO JUST A STATE FOR THE RECORD -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS A FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT STAFF. COMPARED TO FIFTY ONE STAFF AT THE LA OFFICE. SO SO EIGHT I GUESS THAT WOULD ONLY TIME NOW ALMOST. TEN TO ONE OKAY. LET ME JUST SAY FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE BRING THIS A CA FORWARD -- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ALIENS OFFICE GETS BROUGHT BACK TO ITS -- PREVIOUS STAFFING AND REALLY NOT ONLY DO THEY PROVIDE IT -- VERY IMPORTANT FISCAL ANALYSIS THEY ALSO PROVIDE A VERY. VERY STRONG AND IMPARTIAL POLICY ANALYSIS ON ON MANY KEY -- LONG TERM ISSUES I THINK UNFORTUNATELY -- WE DON'T HAVE THE FORESIGHT TO SAY TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE WILDFIRE ISSUE THAT WOULDHAVE BEEN AN ISSUE WHERE WE REALLY COULD HAVE. USED THEIR ASSISTANCE ARE REALLY USE THEIR USER GUIDES BUT MANY OF THESE OTHER ISSUES THEY PLAY A VERY FOR CRITICAL ALSO THANK YOU -- FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO LIGHT AND AND REALLY CHAMPING THIS -- WHY DON'T WE SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET ONE WE MOVE ON TO THE A. B.? FIFTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE FISCALE SYSTEM AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN BRINGING STATE FINANCES INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. BUT I THINK EVERYONE IS ALSO HEARD ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE HAD IN DEPLOYING FISCALE -- JUST WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS STATE COMPTROLLER BETTY ISSUED A LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE IN WHICH SHE EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERN. THAT THE DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY USING FISCALE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HER WITH THE INFORMATION THAT SHE NEEDS. TO COMPILE THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPILE THAT REPORT OR BY HAVING TO ADMIT THAT WE HAVE -- WE HAVE -- ESTIMATES IN THERE INSTEAD OF ACTUAL FIGURES. MIGHT BE SOMETHING AS SEVERE AS GETTING A DOWNGRADE TO THE STATE'S DEBT RATING SO IT'S IT'S A VERY DIRE SITUATION THERE. LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR WAS ASKED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE FISCAL SYSTEM AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND DEPLOYMENT AND THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ISSUED A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL REPORTING. FROM HIS CAL SO THIS BILL IMPLEMENTS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND REQUIRES THE OFFICE OF FISCAL TO INCLUDE THE ITEMS IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDITOR IN THEIR ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNANCE BILL AND AT THE PROPER TIME WOULD REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. GREAT THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ON THIS WAS THE OTHER **** ALL GO BACK TO WILL GO TO FINANCE. FOR HI YES WE DON'T HAVE AN APPROVED POSITION YET ON THIS BILL BUT WE WOULD CONCUR WITH THE STAFF'S ANALYSIS. OF MINOR OBSERVABLE COSTS TO THE DEPARTMENT THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AGAIN WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU -- TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE THE IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN VERY CRITICAL. TO ALL THE AGENCIES AND FORCEFULLY HASN'T GONE NEARLY AS SMOOTHLY AS AS WE'D LIKE IT'S A REALLY APPRECIATE YOU -- FOR FOR BRING IN THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD AS WELL. OKAY. SO -- WILL BE AGAIN MOVING THESE BILLS FORWARD TODAY. WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING ACTION IN FULL COMMITTEE ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CRUSHER. WITH THAT WE HAVE TO OTHER AUTHORS WE ARE WAITING FOR YEAH [inaudible] OKAY. MR REALLY COME ON UP. YOU'RE THE NEXT CONTESTANT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER SIX THANK YOU AB. THREE TWO THREE THIS IS A FAIRLY. STRAIGHTFORWARD REQUEST HERE BECAUSE OUR STATE S FACING A NEW NORMAL FOR NATURAL DISASTERS. THIS THREATENS TO STRAIN OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS ACCOUNT. WHICH WILL ASSIST ALL OF US IN PREPARING FOR ANY FUTURE REDUCTION OR STAGNATION IN THE STATE'S REVENUES. IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER CASH FLOW WILL BE CRITICAL TO COVER THE COST OF IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WILL BE NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO ADDRESS SERIOUS PUBLIC AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS BUT TO FACILITATE A QUICK RECOVERY. LAST YEAR'S FIRES ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN DISASTER ASSISTANCE COSTS. WELL FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS COMMON IN THE AFTERMATH OF DISASTERS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS CAN OFTEN BE UNCERTAIN. IN SUMMARY THIS PROPOSAL WORK RATE. A RESERVE ACCOUNT SO CALIFORNIA CAN SAVE MONEY DURING BUDGET SURPLUS YEARS AND REMAIN PREPARED TO FRONT ANY NECESSARY RECOVERY COSTS. WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS. AGAIN TIME WILL BE OF THE ESSENCE. IF IF UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE IN FUTURE NATURAL DISASTERS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR CONSIDERATION. YOU MISTER DAILY -- FINANCE WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL WE'RE STILL ABOUT EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND LOOK FOR TO FUTURE DISCUSSIONS IS THAT MOST OF FOR BUDGET. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR ABROAD. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE SEVEN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD -- IN THE PAST I HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF THE CREATION OF ADDITIONAL RESERVE ACCOUNTS JUST BECAUSE OF THE WORDING OF STATE LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIAL FROM -- FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES THE SFU THE SAYS WHEN THE SFU BALANCE GET SUFFICIENTLY HIGH. THAT THAT TRIGGERS AN AUTOMATIC QUARTER PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE STATE WIDE SALES TAX AND SO I FELT THAT SOME OF THE EFFORTS IN THE PAST TO CREATE. THESE ADDITIONAL RESERVE ACCOUNTS -- WERE DELAYING THE DID THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT SALES TAX REDUCTION. HOWEVER I DON'T HAVE THAT THOUGHT ABOUT THE THE BILL THAT YOU'RE BRINGING FORWARD HERE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE -- I I THINK THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR BECAUSE OF THE SPORADIC NATURE OF THESE NATURAL DISASTERS AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THEM AND THE TIMING DIFFICULTIES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT RESERVE ACCOUNT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING. SO I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD -- DEFINITELY GONNA BE GOOD FOR OUR STATE BUDGET AND GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID AND I RESPECT TO YOUR CONCERN ABOUT. THE PREVIOUS ADDITIONAL RESERVE% THAT I HAD REQUESTED LAST YEAR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I DID JUST WHAT THEY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE BILL WE THINK IT'S MUCH NEEDED UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE DISASTER BUSINESS YEAH -- AND IT'S ALL TOO USED TO BE THE DISASTERS WHAT HAPPENED ON OCCASION AND WE RESPOND UNFORTUNATELY. IT LOOKS TO BE THIS GOING TO BE MORE OF AN ANNUAL OCCURRENCES SO IT'S GOOD. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME MORE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT MISTER CHAIR AND I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED I HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CO AUTHORS AS WELL -- BECAUSE OF THE SCHEDULES TODAY WAS HARD FOR ANY OF THEM TO ATTEND BUT I THINK THEY'RE SIX OR SEVEN CO AUTHORS GREAT THANK FROM THE ASSEMBLY THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. SO WE'RE GOING TO STOP FOR A SECOND AND TAKE ROLE TO ESTABLISH QUORUM. TANK HERE BLOOM BRO. COOPER. FONG MCCARTY OBERNOLTE WEBER. GREAT THANK YOU WE ARE WAITING. FOR ONE MORE AUTHORED 2% AND THEN WILL BE GOING TO OUR ON OVERSIGHT HEARING WHICH WE HAVE WITH ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION. IN THE ASSEMBLY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE UHHUH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] I HAVE. OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD AWAITING. THIS IS DAN. YEAH YEAH YEAH -- EDITORS BUT WITH ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION AND ASSEMBLY ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT [inaudible] SHE WE YEAH. MISS RUBIO. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN THROUGH THE RESCUE RIGHT YES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN HERE TODAY. I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF AS TODAY'S I SUBJECT MATTER HEARING. DURING MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE. OF SERVING ON BUDGET SUB. ONE RELATING TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THROUGH THESE HEARINGS ALONG% WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES IN A RESPONSIVE MANNER. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES D. H. C. S. HAS A TOTAL BUDGET PROJECTION PROJECTED TO BE JUST ABOVE A HUNDRED BILLION. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY INCLUDING ALL STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS GIVING. DH CS THE LARGEST DEPARTMENT BUDGET IN THE STATE. IN RECENT YEARS THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE H. YES. HAS RESULT IN IT THE RESULT IN A SIZEABLE. BUDGET ERROR DUE TO POOR INTERNAL PROCEDURES. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE MEDICAL ESTIMATE WAS FOUND TO BE OFF BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. ME SAY THAT AGAIN ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS DUE TO A MISCALCULATION OF COST AN INCORRECT ACCOUNTING FOR RETRACTED FEDERAL DRUG REBATE PAYMENTS. WHEN I ASKED -- FOR THE REASON. THEY ATTRIBUTED THAT TO A CLERICAL ERROR. AND I THEN ASKED -- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONEY AND THE MONEY WAS SPENT ANYWAY EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A CLERICAL ERROR? THOSE TWO AREAS WERE SO LARGE THEY LET IT LET THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PROPOSE OFFSETTING CUTS. TO LEGISLATIVE SPENDING PRIORITIES TO PAY FOR THE LAST FUNDING. IN ADDITION TO THIS MATH OF ERROR DATE CASF HAS CONTINUALLY MISMANAGED SOME OF ITS SMALLER OPERATIONS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THI OCCURRED WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S HANDLING OF ITS SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OUR SUBCOMMITTEES IN THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO DATE DATE CS IN ORDER TO OPERATE THESE HOT LINES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE APPROPRIATED ANOTHER FOUR POINT THREE MILLION. HOWEVER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DURING A SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING WE WERE INFORMED THAT DESPITE THE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING DTS WAS NOT OPERATING A SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE AT ALL. ON TOP OF THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS ASKING FOR ANOTHER FOUR POINT THREE MILLION. AFTER A LOT OF A LOT BACK AND FORTH AND LETTERS. AND LETTERS IT WAS FINALLY BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THE HOT LINES WERE BEING HELD DUE TO CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. THIS TROUBLING MISMANAGEMENT HAS STUCK WITH ME BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES HERE. WE DON'T BUILD CARS LEAVE US THESE MONIES GO DIRECTLY TO HELP PEOPLE AND THAT WAS A BIG FRUSTRATION FOR ME. THIS ISN'T THE DMV WHERE ERRORS AND MISMANAGEMENT RESULT IN INCREASED WAIT WAIT TIMES THIS IS. LITERALLY SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES. THIS IS A DEPARTMENT WHERE MISMANAGEMENT LEAVES PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND LIVES AT STAKE. THERE NEEDS TO BE A HIGHER STANDARD. FROM THE TOP ON DOWN IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT DH CS NEEDS A CULTURE CHANGE AND AN INCREASED FOCUS ON PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE AND RESULTS TO CALIFORNIANS. I HOPE THE MY BILL AB SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN WHICH I'M -- I AM HERE TO DISCUSS TODAY WILL BEGIN A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION ON HOW TO BEST IMPROVE THE ACS AND INCREASED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO PRESENT HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO PRESENTING DISPEL IN FRONT OF THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS RUBIO FINANCE YES WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE AN APPROVED POSITION ON THIS BILL -- BUT WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE ESTIMATED COST OF SHIFTING TO PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING A IS STILL TO BE DETERMINED AND WILL DEPEND ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGETING METHODOLOGY. A AND IS ALSO NOTED IN YOUR COMMITTEES ANALYSIS. WE ANTICIPATE THIS BILL WILL RESULT IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES A GIVEN THE WORKLOAD TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH INCLUDES THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS -- IN TWENTY FIVE PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS FOR BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING TO STRENGTHEN THE FISCAL FORCE CAN FOR FISCAL FORECASTING. OF THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATES AND TO IMPROVE THE OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF CASH FLOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS MR MODE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY WOMAN PURPOSE PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING IS AN INTRIGUING CONCEPT. AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN TRIED BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT NOT RECENTLY THOUGH. BUT CHAIRMAN TING AND I OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SPEARHEAD AN EFFORT. TO TRY TO GET THE STATE TO TRY ALTERNATIVE BUDGETING PRACTICES AND SO WE HAVE BEEN TRYING -- TO THE PILOT PROGRAM ON MISSION BASED BUDGETING OR WHAT PEOPLE CALL ZERO BASED BUDGETING SO THE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE DOWN. SHIFTING TO A ZERO BASED BUDGETING FOR VARIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE DH CS IS AND THAT SCHEDULE BUT I'M WONDERING WHY. ARE WE WOULD INSTITUTE A NEW KIND OF BUDGETING JUST FOR THIS ONE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE THIS PROGRAM THAT WE'RE TRANSITIONING TO WHY NOT JUST -- ARGUE FOR ACCELERATING AT A TRANSITION TO ZERO BASED BUDGETING FOR DHS. UP WHAT THE PURPOSE THE FOR MY BRING THIS BILL UP AND I DO UNDERSTAND I WAS TOLD BY THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS. BILL HAS BEEN PROPOSED AT LEAST THREE TIMES BEFORE AND SO INSTEAD OF DOING THE WHOLE STATE BUDGET OBVIOUSLY AS A BIG MONSTER -- MY FRUSTRATION WITH DH CS HAS BEEN -- SO CONSISTENT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WHERE I'VE BEEN -- ASKING QUESTIONS AND ASKING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY TO HEAR. SORRY -- THE END UP FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR OF CLERICAL ERROR THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD IT WAS A CLERICAL ERROR. AND I SAID WELL IF IT WAS A CLERICAL ERROR WAS THE MONEY. AND THEY HAD SPENT THE MONEY AND THEN -- WHEN I ASKED OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH? FOR THEY DID ADMITTED AT FIRST BITE I AFTER I PUSHED I SAID WHO WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT CHEMICAL -- AND THE ANSWER WAS. NOBODY. SAID WELL WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NOBODY'S SOUL SO FOR ME -- AND SAID TACKLING THE WHOLE ENTIRE BUDGET LIKE YOU ARE PROPOSING D. EIGHT C. S. IS SUCH A CRITICAL PROGRAM. WHERE PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO DO IT HERE AND IN THE AISLE COORDINATION WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT WE TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE WAYS OF DOING THIS BY? THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IT'S MISMANAGED DEPARTMENT. AND FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN FRUSTRATED FOR WITH QUESTIONS AND LACK OF ANSWERS EVEN THE SUICIDE PREVENTION LINE IN COMMITTEE. I WHEN I ASKED HAVE YOU GIVEN THE THE THE MONEY FOR THE FOR THE SUICIDE PREVENTION LINE I WAS TOLD THREE TIMES YES YES YES AND WHEN I LOOKED OVER TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THEY SAID WE HAVEN'T AS TO WHERE THE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEAD JUMPED UP AND SAID ALL SORRY I MISSPOKE. AND TO WEAR WHICH I RESPONDED WHY YOU'RE MISS SPEAKING PEOPLE ARE DYING SOUL IN PARTICULAR THIS DEPARTMENT. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PEOPLE'S LIVES AND WE'RE LOSING LITERALLY LOSING PEOPLE'S LIVES BECAUSE WE ARE THEY ARE INEFFECTIVE AND SO THANK YOU FOR FOR THE WORK FROM THE COMMITTEE. BECAUSE I I AGAIN I TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A BIG BIG TASK -- BUT FOR ME IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE GET THIS STARTED RIGHT AWAY I RESTART HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE. IT. IN LIEU OF BE YOU KNOW THE PROCESS THAT YOU'RE DOING AGAIN MAINLY BECAUSE IT'S PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS NOT THE DMV AGAIN. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS DIRECTLY AFFECTING PEOPLE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I MEAN GIVEN THE FACT THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THIS COMMITTEE ALREADY HAS A PROCESS FOR TRANSITIONING DEPARTMENTS TO MISSION BASED BUDGETING. WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING BUT KIND OF SIMILAR IN THE SENSE THAT YOU TAKE A HOLISTIC LOOK AT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO WITH THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO DO IT. AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHILE WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL WOULDN'T THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF WE JUST ACCELERATED THE PROCESS OF APPLYING THE EXISTING. ZERO BASED BUDGETING PROGRAM TO DH YES I WOULD HOPE -- AND THAT'S YOU KNOW UP TO TO THE COMMITTEE YOU KNOW INTO TO MISTER TING TO TO LET ME KNOW WHERE WE FALL IN THIS PROCESS BY I BE OPEN. TO A CONVERSATION BUT AGAIN FOR ME IT WAS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL IN -- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THANK YOU IS THIS IF I MAY THE ARM -- DEPARTMENT FIND IT IS COMING BACK AND ARE ABLE TWENTY NINE FULL HEARING. IN THIS IS ROOM BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE BILL SO I THINK MY PRIOR TO THAT I THINK WE CAN WE CAN WORK TERM MERGE EVERYONE'S EFFORTS SUCKS I THINK WE'RE ALL TRYING. TO MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND I THINK THIS THIS DEPARTMENT -- IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE -- NEED THIS AND THAT THE PLAN NEEDS GREATER OVERSIGHT I WE FOR UNFORTUNATELY -- NOT HAD. AN EXPERIENCE WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FORTHRIGHT IN COMMITTEE RIGHT SO I THINK -- I THINK WE'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING MISTER VICE CHAIR AND WENT ON THIS RUBIO SAYING I THINK WE CAN ACCOMPLISH BOTH GOALS. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND AS LONG AS I THINK THAT WE'RE WORKING ALL TOWARD THE SAME GOAL -- AGAIN IT'S FRUSTRATING I YOU KNOW WE COME FROM THE REAL WORLD WHERE WHERE WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT FOR THE ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE YOU KNOW WHEN I I TALKED ABOUT THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION NOBODY HAD AN ANSWER AND WHEN I ASKED WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE IT WAS LIKE. NOBODY NOBODY'S BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND AT MINIMUM YOU KNOW THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE IS NOT HAPPENING SO I APPRECIATE YOU YOU KNOW -- LISTENING TO TO THIS REQUEST AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER I THINK THAT IF WE CAN ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF A BASELINE FOR SOME OF THESE DEPARTMENTS WE THE OUTCOMES WOULD BE BETTER AND I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES WERE THROWING MONEY AT ISSUES THAT IF WE DID. BETTER BUDGETING ARE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH MORE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT A MAYBE BY STATE MAY NOT BE SO ROSY FOR FOR ALL OF US IN THE FIRST FIRST DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE CRACKED. ARE USUALLY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU SO AGAIN WILL BE TAKING UP -- ALL FOR BILLS IN OUR FULL COMMITTEE ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING THERE THANK YOU AND I AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE THE I WANT TO JUST. WE EMPHASIZE THAT THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT HAS DONE BECAUSE I KNOW THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP UP IN MULTIPLE TIMES AND HE WAS WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH US AND TALK. THROUGH HOW WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR TAKING ON THIS VERY
