00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:27.286 region:rollup2
ARRIVE OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE

00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:28.387 region:rollup2
AUTHOR.

00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:29.288 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD AND I DO AND MAYBE THE

COMMITTEE CONSULTANT CAN CAN

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:32.257 region:rollup2

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:33.525 region:rollup2
PAGE THREE LINE SEVEN TO

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:34.827 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN THERE'S THIS LANGUAGE

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:36.595 region:rollup2

AND WITH IT IF I WAS JUST DUMB.

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:45.070 region:rollup2
GLANCING READING THAT I THINK

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:46.538 region:rollup2
WILL ARE. THE OPPOSITE AGENT

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.840 region:rollup2
REQUIRE TO TO GIVE INFORMATION

ON A COMPETITOR'S PRODUCT

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.876 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE

00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:52.578 region:rollup2
ANTI COMPETITIVE IT WOULD SEEM

00:26:50.876 --> 00:26:53.579 region:rollup2
SEEM STRANGE.

00:26:52.578 --> 00:26:55.113 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN SOME CLARIFICATION

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:58.050 region:rollup2

ON THE BILL.

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:09.228 region:rollup2
THE INTENTION ISN'T REALLY FOR

00:27:07.493 --> 00:27:11.163 region:rollup2
AGENT NUMBER ONE TO SELL AGED

00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:13.365 region:rollup2

GO TALK TO THOSE GUYS.

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:24.042 region:rollup2
MOON THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO AND

THE FINDER TOOL THAT THE

00:27:29.181 --> 00:27:32.684 region:rollup2
WITNESSES TESTIFY TO IT IN SO

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:35.120 region:rollup2
WITH THAT BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE

00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:36.255 region:rollup2
HERE IS THE AGENT SHALL. IT'S

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.457 region:rollup2

IT'S SHALL AND SO.

00:27:38.457 --> 00:27:41.226 region:rollup2
THAT PUTS THE AGING KIND OF AN

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:42.227 region:rollup2
INTERESTING POSITION IF THEY

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:43.228 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW OF ANOTHER OF IN

00:27:42.227 --> 00:27:45.030 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF AGAIN HOW DOES

00:27:43.228 --> 00:27:46.865 region:rollup2
THAT WORK IN PRACTICE. WHAT WE

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:49.034 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT

00:27:46.865 --> 00:27:51.036 region:rollup2
THESE POLICIES EXIST OUT THERE?

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:52.170 region:rollup2
THAT IF CONSUMERS WERE ARE

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:53.338 region:rollup2
WILLING TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.973 region:rollup2

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:01.947 region:rollup2
I AT THE END OF THE DAY.

00:28:00.112 --> 00:28:03.482 region:rollup2
IN AYE I DO WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:28:01.947 --> 00:28:05.050 region:rollup2
THESE HOW A FIFTY PERCENT PLUS

00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:06.919 region:rollup2
POLICY WOULD BE PRICE BUT THE

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.520 region:rollup2
OTHER DAY I WOULD THINK THAT.

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:10.389 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.124 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY'S DANTA STAND TO

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:13.692 region:rollup2
GAIN ON THIS BY BY HAVING THESE

00:28:12.124 --> 00:28:14.826 region:rollup2
HAVE THESE PEOPLE INSURED BUT WE

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:16.461 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:17.996 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE POLICIES EXIST WERE

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:19.998 region:rollup2

.

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:25.938 region:rollup2
AND THE I THINK THIS IS THAT

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.573 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IS A BRIDGE UNTIL WE

00:28:25.938 --> 00:28:29.007 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS TOOL THAT WILL ALLOW

00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:30.175 region:rollup2

JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT.

00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:58.029 region:rollup2
OUR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:34:56.161 --> 00:35:00.065 region:rollup2
SOMETHING PROACTIVE.

00:34:58.029 --> 00:35:02.167 region:rollup2
A MERCURY WAS SUBJECT TO A

00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:04.369 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:05.170 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO FROM A GROUP OF AGENTS

00:35:04.369 --> 00:35:06.838 region:rollup2
CONCERNING THEIR COMMISSION

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:08.640 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS.

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:10.342 region:rollup2
AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.110 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE OTHER

00:35:10.342 --> 00:35:14.412 region:rollup2
AGAINST AN INSURER SEVERAL YEARS

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.847 region:rollup2
AGO IN BOTH INSTANCES INSURERS

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:17.515 region:rollup2
ONE AT THE TRIAL COURT LEVEL.

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:19.985 region:rollup2
BUT THE EFFORT IS IS TO DO

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:21.853 region:rollup2
SOMETHING PROACTIVE NOW WE

00:35:19.985 --> 00:35:23.521 region:rollup2
WORKED ON THE LANGUAGE THAT IS

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:25.890 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY CONTAINED IN THE BILL

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:27.592 region:rollup2
WITH THE. A GROUP REPRESENTING

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:30.328 region:rollup2
MOST PRODUCERS.

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:31.763 region:rollup2
IT IS. YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:32.931 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED A REBUTTABLE

00:35:31.763 --> 00:35:33.898 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION.

00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:35.433 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE.

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:36.701 region:rollup2
AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED THAT

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:38.069 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:39.938 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THE.

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:41.806 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION THAT WAS DROPPED

00:35:39.938 --> 00:35:42.741 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHTEEN HOURS AGO I

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:45.176 region:rollup2
BELIEVE.

00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:47.979 region:rollup2
RAISING SOME CONCERNS.

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:50.048 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SOMEHOW INOCULATING

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:52.050 region:rollup2
OF THESE AGREEMENTS I THINK IS

00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:54.119 region:rollup2
ON WARRANTED ESPECIALLY WITH A

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.988 region:rollup2
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION.

YOU ARE. A. ANALYSIS AS WELL AS

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:00.925 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION OF THAT WAS

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:01.960 region:rollup2
DROPPED INDICATED THAT THAT THIS

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:03.628 region:rollup2
MIGHT APPEAR TO BE IN

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.131 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:08.433 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THIS IS THE LANGUAGE.

00:36:06.131 --> 00:36:10.368 region:rollup2
WE WORKED ON OF THE LANGUAGE AS

AGENTS AND BROKERS. AND.

00:36:12.404 --> 00:36:17.108 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS NO EFFORT TO CHANGE

00:36:14.873 --> 00:36:18.376 region:rollup2
IT TO SOMETHING ELSE ABSENT THE

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:20.812 region:rollup2
