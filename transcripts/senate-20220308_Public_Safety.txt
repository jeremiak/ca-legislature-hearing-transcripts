CUSTOMARY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS DISRUPTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR HAVE THEIR CONNECTIONS MUTED. BUT TODAY WE HAVE FIVE BILLS ON OUR AGENDA- S. B. NINE OH THREE IS ON CONSENT BUT BEFORE WE ARE HERE OUR FIRST PRESENTATION WE NEED TO STOP THEIR QUORUM WERE ANNOUNCER CONSULTANT CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. BRADFORD YOUR BRADFORD HERE A CHAU VOGUE HERE TROUBLE HERE CALM WATER. SKINNER WIENER. WIENER HERE TO QUORUM MEMBERS A QUORUM IS PRESENT. JOHN NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR AND NOT SENATOR MANNY AS S. B. EIGHT SIX THREE CENTER MAN WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN AND FUTURE READ FOR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE WOULD ALLOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAMS TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTING TO ALSO EXAMINE NEAR DEATH INCIDENTS RESULTING FROM DOMESTIC ABUSE. ANY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE WORK OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAM SO LET ME JUST BRIEFLY GO OVER WHAT THEY DO THEY- PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN CREATING RESEARCH ON DOMESTIC ABUSE RELATED FATALITIES. WITH THE CENTRAL GOAL OF IDENTIFYING GAPS IN THE SYSTEM AND TRYING TO PREVENT FUTURE TRAGEDIES. THAT ROUTINES ARE OPTIONAL FOR COUNTIES AND ARE COMPRISED OF VOLUNTEERS FROM LEGAL HEALTH SERVICE ADVOCACY JUDICIAL GROUPS. THEY WORK WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO PROVIDE A CONFIDENTIAL FORUM TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED DEATHS. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THEY DO NOT CHANGE THE LAW- AND SO CONTRARY TO I THINK SOME OF THE CRITICS THAT WE RECEIVED ON THIS BILL THEY ARE PURELY ADVISORY BODY. AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE BENEFICIAL ROLE THAT THESE TEAMS PLAY THE ORANGE COUNTY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAM. RECENTLY REPORT PRODUCED A REPORT CONTAINING DATA AND RECOMMENDATIONS STEMMING FROM TEN YEARS WORTH OF RESEARCH. THIS CRITICAL REPORT SHED LIGHT ON MANY ISSUES IN MY COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY ILLUSTRATING SOME OF THE TRIGGERS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATHS SOME OF THE PATTERNS THAT ABUSE CAN FOLLOW. WHAT WARNING SIGNS TO LOOK OUT FOR AND MORE. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY LIMITS THESE TEAMS TO ONLY INVESTIGATE AND RESEARCH SITUATIONS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE ABUSE THAT ACTUALLY RESULT IN DEATH. THIS IGNORES A LARGE NUMBER OF INCREDIBLY SERIOUS INCIDENTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE PUSA PARTY CAME VERY CLOSE TO BUT DID NOT ACTUALLY SUCCEED IN KILLING THE OTHER PARTY. COMMUNITIES AND EXPERTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT IF WE ARE ALLOWED TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE HERE SO THAT WE LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED NEAR DEATH INCIDENTS. THESE VOICES PROVIDE CRUCIAL CONTEXT BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RARE INSIGHTSABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE CAN'T GATHER WHEN WE'RE ONLY LOOKING CASES WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL HAS DIED. ON A NATIONWIDE LEVEL WE'RE SEEING MANY STATES RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTIGATING NEAR DEATH INCIDENTS AND EXPANDING THE ROLE OF DEATH REVIEW TEAMS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOR A THIRD OF STATE LEGISLATURES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE PASSED LAWS AUTHORIZING DEATH REVIEW TEAMS TO RESEARCH NEAR FATALITIES. CALIFORNIA IS FALLING BY I'M HERE AND NOT WE- AND ARE UPDATED LAWS ARE HINDERING OUR- TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH THAT CAN HELP US PREVENT FUTURE DEBTS. HAVING THIS DATA AT OUR FINGERTIPS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER AS WE'VE SEEN REPORTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURGEON LAST COUPLE YEARS BECAUSE OF THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE CAN'T AFFORD TYRONE HANDS BEHIND OUR BACKS WHEN IT COMES TO RESEARCHING AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO PREVENT DOMESTIC ABUSE RELATED DEATHS. THIS IMPORTANT ROLE THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAMS PLAYING PROCEEDING AND PROTECTING SURVIVORS ADDRESS ABOUNDS SB SIXTY THREE WOULD AUTHORIZE TEAMS INVESTIGATE NEAR DEATH INCIDENTS. BRING CALIFORNIA IN ALIGNMENT WITH NUMEROUS OTHER STATES. I WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY BETHANY WEBB A SURVIVOR OF THE SEAL BEACH SALON SHOOTING. AND DR DAVID WELCH ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ORANGE COUNTY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAM. THANK YOU ARE IN FAIRNESS WILL PROVIDE FOUR MINUTES TO EACH SIDE BOTH IN SUPPORT OF OPPOSITION IF WE HAVE OUR FIRST WITNESS- HERE PRESENT HERE IN THE ROOM. SHE'S FROM THE PHONE. I AM MODERATOR WILL YOU ARM WITNESS MAY BEGIN. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME. HI MY NAME IS STEPHANIE WEBER. ON JUNE SIXTH TWO THOUSAND AND TEN MY OLDEST CHILD NICKY CAME HOME FROM AN OVERNIGHT VISIT WITH HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER. I KNOW THIS IS NOT AN EASY PHASES BRIDGES FALLEN YOU CAN FASTER DISTURBING GOING ON FOR AWHILE AND HADN'T SAID ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THAT IT WOULD BE WAY WORSE IF I WAS TOLD. I PROMISE THURMOND I WOULD NEVER STAND NIKKI BACK AGAIN HOWEVER THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER BEGAN PETITIONING WITHIN WEEKS FOR REUNIFICATION AND. THE COURT WAS WORKING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I THE OTHER HOW MUCH TO RUN AWAY MY JOB IN ORDER TO PROTECT MAKING. I'M NOT CHANGING MY SISTER LARA. WORKER MICHELLE AT THE SALON THERE ARE CHARGES BEACH WAS ALSO GOING TO A CHILD CUSTODY COURT. SHE HAD BEEN WE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE SIMILARITIES IN OUR CASES. SHE HAD A FIVE YEAR RESTRAINING ORDER THAT WAS RESCINDED IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. ON OCTOBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN MICHELIN HER ACTUALLY GETTING FIFTY FIFTY CUSTODY THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH. ON OCTOBER TWELFTH HE WALKED INTO SALON MARRIAGE JOSH BONTA THREE GUN AND A BULLET PROOF VEST. HE WENT STRAIGHT TO MICHELLE AND SAID THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED. AND STARTED. MICHELLE AND THEN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES HE SHOT A TOTAL OF NINE PEOPLE EIGHT OF THEM DIED INCLUDING MY SISTER LARA AND MICHELLE MY MOM WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT DAY THAT WAS SHOT AND SURVIVED SHE WAS THERE GETTING HER NAILS DONE. IT WAS BACK IN COURT FIVE DAYS LATER ON OCTOBER SEVENTH AND AGAIN ON DECEMBER THIRD TWO. BIOLOGICAL FATHER BECAME SO AGGRESSIVE THAT I WAS GIVEN A FIVE YEAR RESTRAINING ORDER. I'M HERE TO TELL MY SIDE OF THE STORY. MICHELLE LET'S NOT AND HOW MUCH MORE COULD WE LEARN IF SHE WAS. YEAH YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ON THE LINE. THE TERM ONLY WOULDN'T SO NOW WE HAVE DOCTOR DAVID WELCH- ONE OF MEMBERS ORANGE COUNTY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT THREE EIGHTEEN I THINK YOU SOMEONE. DR WELCH. GOOD AFTERNOON YOUR HONOR.

AND HAVE BEEN ON THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAM COMING UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS. CURRENTLY WE ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO EXAMINE FATALITIES ARE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAM RELIED ON CORONER'S OFFICE RECORDS POLICE REPORT AND DATABASE SEARCHES. WE'VE OFTEN FOUND THAT'S VERY LIMITING INFORMATION ABOUT THE HISTORY LEADING UP TO THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDES AND ESPECIALLY HOMICIDE SUICIDE. BECAUSE THERE'S NO REMAINING PERPETRATOR INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION. INSTEAD THE CALORIES RECORDS ARE FOCUSED ON THE DETECTION OF THE CAUSE OF DEATH NOT BACKGROUND DYNAMICS AND HELP VICTIMS TRYING TO SEEK OPTION FOR TEAMS TO REVIEW NEAR FATAL CASES AND ANY SURVIVORS AND PUT THEM VOLUNTARY. THE BILL PROVIDES CONFIDENTIALITY AND LIABILITY PROTECTIONS I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THE CALIFORNIA CAN JOIN OTHER STATES AND ALLOWING DOMESTIC. VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW CHANGE TO LEARN FROM NEAR FATAL ABUSES. WE CALIFORNIA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE UNABLE TO BENEFIT FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST RESOURCES IN OUR- I'M JAIL. AND FATAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE VOICES AND EXPERIENCES OF SURVIVORS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR FIFTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE PASSED STATUTE ALLOWING NEAR DEATH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE EXAMINATION AND REVIEW OF NEAR DEATH.

IS NOT PROFITING FROM THE SALE OF FIREARMS AMMUNITION AND FIREARM PRECURSOR PARTS ON STATE PROPERTY OR FACILITATING GUN SHOWS THAT CAN UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA STRONG FIREARM REGULATIONS. AS YOU'LL LIKELY REMEMBER LAST YEAR I BROUGHT A SIMILAR BILL TO THIS COMMITTEE- THAT BILL DID PASS IN THE SENATE BUT WAS NARROWED IN THE ASSEMBLY TO FOCUS SOLELY ON ORANGE COUNTY. BUT WE WATCH OUR LAST YEAR THE TERRIFYING CONSEQUENCES OF GUN SALES AND VIOLENCE AS THEY PLAY OUT. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DEATHS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF GUN VIOLENCE NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED MASS SHOOTINGS TOOK PLACE IN EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION GUNS WERE SOLD. I THINK I TOLD YOU THE ORIGINS OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO- WHEN I WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE SEAT I NOW HOLD THAT WE HAD THE EL PASO SHOOTINGS FOLLOWED BY THE DAYTON SHOOTINGS- THAT NEXT MORNING. MY FAMILY AND I WERE SCHEDULED TO RUN A FIVE K. FUN RUN AT THIS ORANGE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS I AND AS WE CROSS THE FINISH LINE- EVERYONE OF US INCLUDING MY YOUNGEST WHO'S THEN ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD- WAS HANDED WE ARE HAND FLYERS PROMOTING NEXT WEEKEND'S. GUN SHOW THAT THE STATE THAT SAME FAIRGROUNDS NOW WHEN I GREW UP- FAIRGROUNDS ARE MEANT FOR FAMILY FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES AND TODAY THERE UNFORTUNATELY SYNONYMOUS WITH GUN SHOWS- THE VIOLENT OVERTONES OF THOSE GUN SHOWS AND AFFECTED THEY FACILITATE THE SALE OF MANY UNLICENSED GUNS. AND MANY MANY MORE LICENSE GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE KNOW THE STRONG LINKAGE BETWEEN GUN DISTRIBUTIONS AND GUN VIOLENCE ACCORDING TO THE GIFFORDS LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE GUN SHOWS OFTEN CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CIRCUMVENT GUN SAFETY LAWS. THEIR COMMON. VENUE FOR STRAW PURCHASES AND ILLEGAL UNDER. OUR OWN- BUREAU ALCOHOL TOBACCO IN FOR. HAS IT. GUN SHOWS AS MAJOR TRACK CHANNEL AND HAVE FOUND THE SALE OF ILLEGAL UNLICENSED GUNS ACROSS THE STATE. MOREOVER THAT IS ONLY BE LISTED GUNS- WE OF COURSE HAVE THE PROBLEM GOES GUNS. AND WHEN I ATTENDED A GUN SHOW A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE MOST POPULAR VENDORS BY FAR WE'RE THE ONE SELLING OF GUN. PARTS MEANT TO BE ASSEMBLED INDICATES THESE ARE CASH AND CARRY. THEIR CARRIED OFF A LOT BY THEY HAVE NO SERIAL NUMBERS ON THEM THEY'RE FAIRLY EASY TO ASSEMBLE I AND THEY ARE NOW UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE- LARGEST SOURCES OF- CROCK CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN THE STATE. DENTURES ARE DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE TO SELL GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE AT THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I'M WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO REPRESENT VENTURA. I TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WEEKEND GUN SHOWS ADVENTURE UP BUT ALSO TO END GUN SHOWS ON STATE PROPERTY. AROUND THE STATE THIS IS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE PROFITING OFF OF THIS WE NEED TO TAKE A STAND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BUT- I HAVEN'T.

THAT WE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION WE FEEL IT REALLY IS A TIME TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF HOW WE APPROACH- BOTH GUNS AND GUN SHOWS AT THE FAIRGROUNDS FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES- ARE FAIR BOARDS NEED TO. CONTRACTING THE GUN SHOWS THEY ARE NOT A PROTECTED CLASS. AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE GRANTED THIS STATUS- COACH OF BROWN'S IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAS MUCH CHANGE MUST BE TREATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. TO CHANGE THE PARADIGM OF HOW WE AS HUMAN BEINGS BROADBAND SAFER COMMUNITIES I WAS ALSO REMEMBER JUST MENTIONED THE- ARE PROLIFIC A NUMBER OF GUN SHOWS THAT COUNTIES HAVE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. ACCESS SOMETIMES- UNLICENSED- OF THE PROLIFERATION OF GHOST GUNS WILL BECOME A SIGNIFICANT- PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT. SO TO CHANGE THE GUN CULTURE AND TO STOP THE ADVERTISING THAT GOES ON OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY TIME THERE'S A GUN SHOW. ON OUR SCHOOL CHILDREN SEE THIS ADVERTISEMENT THEY'RE GOING TO ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS THEIR LIVES HAVE CHANGED FOREVER AROUND THE CULTURE OF GUN SHOWS IN GUNS OF OUR COMMUNITY.

THAT OVERWHELMINGLY EXIST TO KILL PEOPLE. WE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWING THOSE TO BE SOLD ON STATE PROPERTY IT'S AGAINST OUR VALUES. AND WE KNOW THAT. HAVING MORE GUNS MEANS THAT MORE PEOPLE GET SHOT. THAT'S LIKE THAT EMPIRICALLY PROVEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE WHOLE NOTION THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING AROUND GOING ON CRIME SPREES TRAGEDY THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE YES THOSE PEOPLE ARE ARE KILLING PEOPLE IN THE MASS SHOOTINGS ARE HORRIFIC BUT SO MANY SHOOTINGS. ARE YOU KNOW ACCIDENTAL HI IN NATURE SO MANY SHOOTINGS HAPPEN IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE WENT OUT INTENDING ORIGINALLY TO KILL SOMEONE THE MORE GUNS WE HAVE THE MORE PEOPLE. GET SHOT AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU SAW SHOOTINGS IN CALIFORNIA DESPITE YOUR STRONG LAWS AREBUT OUR RATES ARE LOWER THAN STATES THAT HAVE WEAKER LAWS AND IN FACT THEY'RE MORE SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPENED NEAR THE MATA GET THE NEVADA BORDER BECAUSE IN THE BOTTOM THERE ARE LOOSER. LAWS O HAVING LESS ACCESS TO GUNS- MEANS FEWER PEOPLE- GOT SHOT AND FEWER PEOPLE- DIED- AND SO I THINK IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD BONTA AND GUN SALES AND STATE PROPERTY AND I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION OF A ON THE SIDE. CENTER FIVE ZERO STROLL BOOK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK. AS A PROPONENT OF LOCAL CONTROL I- I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTIONS TO ISSUES I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MANDATE EVERY AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT AND FAIRGROUND IN THE STATE WHAT ACTIVITIES THEY CAN. HOLD ON THEIR PROPERTY WHEN THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE ABIDING BY LOCAL REGULATIONS. THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE MORE APPROPRIATE AT A LOCAL LEVEL WHERE EVERY OPPORTUNITY EVERY OPPORTUNITY GIVEN TO THE LOCAL PROPONENTS AND THE OPPONENTS OF GUN SHOWS TO MAKE THEIR CASE IN FRONT OF THE BOARD OF MEMBERS. A FRIEND OF BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE APPOINTED. APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. GUN SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS FOR VENDORS AND THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITH THE APPOINTED WORDS HAVE MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT THESE LEGAL SHOWS REFLECT THE NEEDS AND DESIRES OF THEIR IDIVIDUAL COUNTIES ACCORDING TO THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA PORAC THE GUN SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA MUST COMPLY WITH OVER TWENTY SIX SECTIONS. OF PENAL CODE. BY CHECKING IT OUT. CALIFORNIANS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS HAVE A RIGHT TO EQUAL ACCESS TO ENGAGE IN LEGAL ACTIVITIES ON OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED FAIRGROUNDS I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT LEGAL ACTIVITY WE MIGHT SEEK TO BAN NEXT IF WE SET DOWN THIS PATH. AND MAY I ADD ON A PERSONAL NOTE THAT. I EMPATHIZE AND TRULY UNDERSTAND THE FEAR THAT YOU MAY HAVE- STANDARD MEANT WHEN YOU GO TO AND YOU FINISH AT A MARATHON WITH YOUR FAMILIES AND YOUR HANDED EIGHTY A FLYER FOR A GUN SHOW BUT FOR SOME FAMILIES INCLUDING MANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING FAMILY FRIENDS NEIGHBORS- A- FAMILY CULTURAL RITES OF PASSAGE- WHATEVER YOU MAY CALL IT IT'S A FAMILY ENDEAVOR FROM ANY OF THEM IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS DONE IN A POSITIVE SAFE EDUCATED ENVIRONMENT FOR MANY OF THEM AND IT'S A LITTLE DISTURBING TO THINK THAT WE ARE PUTTING A- OVERALL MMHM. RIGHT ON PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS SPACE BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE IS OUT THERE TO SHOOT AND KILL PEOPLE SOMETIMES IT'S JUST FAMILY TRADITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED ON FOR GENERATIONS AND WE SHOULD RESPECT WE TALK ABOUT RESPECTING PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO- YOU KNOW LIVE THEIR CULTURE LIVE THEIR LIVES AND SO FORTH AND- THEY'RE NOT THE CULPRITS HERE. HOWEVER I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M A FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR AND ACKNOWLEDGE IS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COMPONENT ARE CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE AS A STATE AND AS A NATION. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MUST. CHEST WHOLEHEARTEDLY EMBRACED IN A DRESS- IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR CULTURE AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I RAN FOR OFFICE IS TO ADDRESS TOXICITY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CULTURE. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW ACT IN A WAY THAT- CONTINUES TO PROMOTE CIVILIZED RESPECTFUL MEANS OF- INTERACTION. SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND WE SEE IF I HAVE ALL MY NOTES ADDRESSED HERE. I THINK FOR THOSE REASONS AT THIS TIME I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT BOB THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER TESTIMONY BY MEMBERS HERE IN THE COMMITTEE- NINETEEN NINE I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE TO MEASURE THAT WE HEARD LAST YEAR AND- CHAU WHICH NOTHING NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ON BOTH SIDES- BUT AS STATED- IT SO ELOQUENTLY FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IT'S NOT ABOUT. DENYING ONE'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT IT'S ABOUT WINNING WHERE. THESE GUNS ARE BEING SOLD IN A TYPE OF GUNS ARE BEING SOLD AND- NOT INFRINGING ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS TO HOT BUT A. K. FORTY SEVENS AND- THOSE TYPE OF ASSAULT WEAPONS THAT ARE DESIGNED HAS STATED TO. KILL MASS PEOPLE QUICKLY YOU SHOULDN'T BE SOLD ON ANY STATE PROPERTY I'M A FIRM BELIEVER OF AND I THINK THEY HAVE. NO VALUE- WHATSOEVER OTHER THAN DESTRUCTION ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GET IN THE HANDS OF THE WRONG INDIVIDUALS AND AS WE SAW. JUST ON A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO- IN ANOTHER INCH STATE. A LEGALLY PURCHASED GUN THAT GOT IN AHEAD OF THEIR TEENAGER AND HE- SHOT THREE SCHOOL. MEMBERS MET FOR FOUR SHOTS SO- WE KNOW ACCIDENTS HAPPEN BUT SO. I THINK THIS IS JUST TRYING TO EXTEND- THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO MAKING SURE THAT. GUNS ARE SHOWN IN A MORE PROPER PLACE AT A GUN STORE PURCHASE. ART COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS SHOW- WITH THAT WE- WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE. I THANK YOU MEMBERS I'D APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENTS ON RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. WE HAVE A MY FOR SENATOR WIENER.

WHEN YOU READY YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I WILL BE BRIEF I INTRODUCED HR TWENTY TWO WHEN I REALIZE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE IN SESSION ON THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE JANUARY SIX INSURRECTION- FELT MOST APPROPRIATE TO ME. AND REALLY- ESSENTIAL THAT ARE LEGISLATURE GO ON RECORD ABOUT THIS EVENT. IMPART BECAUSE ALMOST AS DISTURBING AS THE- EVENTS OF THAT DAY WHICH WERE HARD TO. HARD TO PROCESS IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FOLKS IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE TRYING TO REWRITE HISTORY. REWRITE HISTORY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY. TO ROLL BACK VOTING RIGHTS TO REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEGITIMACY OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. WHO ARE PROMOTING CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND MISINFORMATION THAT WOULD A ROADS- FAITH IN GOVERNMENT AND FAITH IN DEMOCRACY AND SO THIS TO ME FELT LIKE AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR US AS A STATE. AND A STATE TO TAKE SUCH A LEADING ROLE TO HAVE MEMBERS GO ON RECORD ABOUT JANUARY SIX TO CONDEMN IT- TO REJECT POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN ALL ITS FORMS TO. EXPRESS OUR CONDOLENCES TO THE- HUNDRED FORTY MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WERE INJURED THAT DAY TO RECOGNIZE THEIR COURAGE AND BRAVERY AND SACRIFICE OF THE FOLKS WHO WERE INJURED AND KILLED. DEFENDING UNITED TATES CAPITOL. AND ALSO TO REMEMBER HOW FRAGILE DEMOCRACY IS AND HOW MUCH WORK WE HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT IT SO. WE HAD A VIGOROUS DEBATE ON THIS IN- IN OUR HOUSE WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF FOLKS IN THE SENATE ON A J. R. TWENTY TWO. YOU DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THOSE MEASURE NONE LISTED- MAR IS THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE PRESIDENT WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF A G. R. A H. A R. TWENTY TWO.

WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY GEARING UP MISTER CHAIR BREAK WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS RELATES TO AG ARE. TWENTY TWO. THIS CENTER CONNOR I WOULD MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE. TIME WE HAVE A MOTION IN SUPPORT OF A J. R. TWENTY TWOS. NO DISCUSSION OR DEBATE BY COLLEAGUES JUST- SHE'S JUST GONNA CURIOUS. ARE THE DESTINATIONS ALREADY GOING ON. YEAH YES THEY ARE SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I THINK YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT- YOU HAD THE DAY JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE- RECENTLY FILE EVIDENCE IN FEDERAL COURT THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. VIOLATED MULTIPLE LAWS IN AN EFFORT TO OVERTURN OUR ELECTION AND SO WE FELT THAT WAS MOST APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT THERE. ARE SO MANY WHO ARE OPPOSING THE WORK OF THE BIPARTISAN SELECT COMMITTEE THAT OUR STATE STANDS FIRMLY IN SUPPORT OF THAT AND EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THEM TO DO A THOROUGH TRANSPARENT- AND RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION TO UNCOVER EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY. THIS I BELIEVE IS IT WAS REALLY A SEMINAL MOMENT IN HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND I THINK ONE THAT ALL OF US WILL REMEMBER FOR OUR ENTIRE LIVES- AND PROBABLY OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS WILL TALK ABOUT- SO TO ME IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT OUR STATE BE ON THE RECORD ABOUT THAT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE WERE IN SESSION. ON THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF AND SO THIS WOULD JUST TRANSMIT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE PRESIDENT THE VICE PRESIDENT FOX AND CONGRESS ARE STRONG SUPPORT FOR A- THOROUGH INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT AND BIPARTISAN INVESTIGATION JANUARY SIXTH. AT THE CALIFORNIA SAID- ELECTED EYES. I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON ON. CALIFORNIA ISSUES BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD AND- AND ACTION THAT THIS IS A FEDERAL ISSUE. AT A FEDERAL LEVEL BUT I UNDERSTAND THE MERITS BEHIND- YOUR INTENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER. INTERSTELLAR THANKYOU I CHAIR- I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT IT IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ACT AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT OCCURRED WITHOUT OUR CAPITAL. I THINK THE VERY- THOSE OF US WHO WATCHED IN HORROR AS IT OCCURRED. THE CONSEQUENCES. ONE COULD IMAGINE SOME VERY SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. FROM THAT DAY. THAT COULD HAVE INCLUDED- WELL FIRST OFF THE- CASUALLY THE DEATHS OF SOME LEGISLATORS. ON EVEN POTENTIALLY THE VICE PRESIDENT BECAUSE AT THE TIME MUCH OF THE BE- ANGER WITH FOCUSED ON THE VICE PRESIDENT IN HIS ROLE TO CERTIFY THE ELECTION- AND IT COULD'VE COST POTENTIALLY A LACK OF CERTIFICATION OF A LEGITIMATE ELECTION. SO UP ND EVERY ASPECT OF WHAT WE THREE KAMAR CHRISSY IS A MESSY BUSINESS JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE NATURE OF IT IS SUCH THAT- WE ALLOW. VOTERS TO CHOOSE THE REPRESENTATIVES AND THE REPRESENTATIVES AS LONG AS ALL OF US TAKE THE OATH HE SWORE TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION AS LONG AS THEY ARE. ACTING WITHIN THEIR THEN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE IN DIRECTIONS THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF US DON'T AGREE WITH. BUT IN THIS CASE. IN ANY INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT WAS A VIOLATION. OF WHAT OUR CONSTITUTION INDICATES AND SO. I FEEL LIKE IT IS OF SUCH THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE COULD HAVE BEEN SO SEVERE AND COULD STILL IMPACT NOT ONLY THE STATE. THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. BUT IF HE ALL OF US AS INDIVIDUALS. THAT I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR US TO ASK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EXPRESS WHAT WE FEEL SHOULD HAPPEN IN THIS SERVICE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT A PROPER INVESTIGATION HAPPENED SO APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FORWARD. YEAH I FIGURE THAT'S AND I JUST OUT OF MY MISTER CHAIRMAN. YOU KNOW REMIND EVERYBODY THE OATH THAT WE ALL TAKE WHEN WE ARE SWORN IN AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND BEFORE OUR DUTY TO DEFEND AND PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALL A FIRM THAT WE WILL PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH INGRAINED IN THE DUTIES THAT WE HAVE AS MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND SQUARELY WITHIN OUR PURVIEW AND TO ME THIS IS. DIRECTLY ON POINT WE HAVE FOLKS WHO ATTACKED AND ATTEMPTED TO UNDERMINE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. AND SUBVERT THE WILL OF OUR VOTERS AND WE HAVE FOLKS ARE TRYING TO REWRITE HISTORY ABOUT THAT AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME AS FOLKS WHO HAVE. SWORN AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SPEAK UP ABOUT IT. THANK YOU CENTER WINNER THANK YOU- YEAH I. YOU KNOW PERSONALLY- I THINK IT'S REALLY AND CALIFORNIA'S INTERESTS TO HAVE A FULL INVESTIGATION. OF WHAT WAS. REALLY A- TREASON S. EFFORT. TO HAVE AN- ARMED OVERTHROW OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WHICH IS WHAT THIS-WAS- THE STAFF IN CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST FOR THAT TO BE FULLY INVESTIGATED. SO WE CAN TAKE STEPS PER NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN- IS YOU KNOW. RELATING TO MY DISTRICT ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WANTED TO KILL THAT DAY WAS WAS MY REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS ON NANCY PELOSI'S REPRESENTS SAN FRANCISCO FOR. THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND DONE SO ADMIRABLY ADMIRABLY AND SHE WAS ON THEIR LIST OF PEOPLE. TO KILL DHANBAD DAY ON THANK GOD SHE WAS IN HER OFFICE WHEN THEY INVADED IT- BECAUSE SHE MIGHT NO LONGER BE WITH US AND SO MY CONSTITUENTS- ARE VERY PROTECTIVE OF OUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS. AND SO WE WANT TO INVESTIGATION- WE KNOW THERE WERE THREATS AGAINST CALIFORNIA CAPITOL IN THE WAKE OF THAT ARMS AT ARMS EFFORT TO OVERTHROW. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND WE ALL REMEMBER WHAT THE SECURITY CALLED PRECAUTIONS THAT WE HAD FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT WERE THE ENTIRE. CAPITAL WAS BARRICADED- AND SO- IT DIRECTLY IMPACTED US. I'M OUT I ALSO THINK THAT. YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY WERE TO DO THEY'RE TRYING TO STEAL CALIFORNIA'S VOICE- BY YOU KNOW WE HAD FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND ALL OVER MANY MILLIONS OF. OF VOTES IN CALIFORNIA WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT HOW VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN AND- DISCOVER. MORE HAVE JUST INVALIDATED THE VOICE OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WE ALREADY- GET SCREWED OVER BY HAVING TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS THE SAME AS- NORTH DAKOTA AND RHODE ISLAND NO DISRESPECT TO THOSE STATES BUT WE ARE DRAMATICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED. IN THE U. S. SENATE AND ALSO IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE- BUT THE LEAST. THEY CAN DO IS COUNT OUR VOTES FOR PRESIDENT AND- DIS INSURRECTIONIST WE'RE TRYING TO INVALIDATE CALIFORNIA'S VOTE SO DIRECTLY TIES. TO INTERESTS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. YOU SENATOR COLLAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I MOVED THE BILL- IS BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT CALIFORNIA IS A BELLWETHER STATE AND HOPEFULLY IF THIS IS PASSED- IT WILL ENCOURAGE OTHER STATES. TO LOOK AT LEGISLATION VERY SIMILAR TO THIS- THE INSURRECTION ONJANUARY SIXTH- NEEDS TO BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED NOT ONLY WERE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS PUT AT RISK AND THE VICE PRESIDENT. BUT ALSO. TEAMS OF STAFF AND IN. WHO GO TO THOSE BUILDINGS EVERY DAY TO DO THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE AND HOPEFULLY THIS INVESTIGATION WILL ALLOW US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROPERLY TRAIN AND SUPPORT THOSE. STAFF WHO COME IN EVERY DAY TO PROVIDE CRITICAL CONSTITUENT SERVICES TO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DESERVING OF A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR THEM. WHEN THE OTHER REALITY IS THAT JANUARY SIXTH TRIGGERED AN AVALANCHE OF VOLATILITY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THAT NOW HINGES ON THE IRRATIONAL AND I THINK WE NEED AN INVESTIGATION TO ALLOW US TO COME BACK TO SOME SHARED TRUTHS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ALLOW US TO MEND A VERY FRAGILE AND YET INTERNATIONALLY CRITICAL DEMOCRACY SO THAT IS WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU AND I TO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS COMMONSENSE MEASURE AND FOR ANYONE TO BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED. JANUARY SIXTH OF LAST YEAR WAS ACT THE PATRIOTISM I'M- I'M I'M I'M A STAUNCH ASTOUNDED BY THAT AND IF THAT'S WITH DIRECT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE I WANT NO PART OF IT I MEAN FOR FIVE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES FOUR HUNDRED OFFICERS. TO BE INJURED AND FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGES TO OUR NATIONAL NATION'S CAPITAL AND FOR SOMEBODY SAID THAT TO ACT THE PATRIOTISM- I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PITCHER TO THOSE ARE IT WAS. DEFINITELY TREASON AND HIGHWAY- USE HATE TO PLAY THIS CAR BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVE THOSE WERE BLACK INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD STORMED A CAPITAL LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE NO QUESTION A WHAT. THEY WOULD BE CALLING US IN THIS COUNTRY AND PEOPLE WOULD SET THEIR HAIR ON FIRE IF NOT EVERYONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE PROSECUTED BUT IN THE FACT MAJORITY MORE WHITE MALES ME. FOR MILITARY AND SOME YOU KNOW POLICE LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAD A PLEA SHE FROM CALIFORNIA WHO PARTICIPATED IN THAT SO WE SHOULD ASK CALIFORNIA WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AND HAVE A FULL INVESTIGATION. AND SET AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND QUESTIONING ANYTHING THAT TOOK PART TOWARD DEMOCRACY WHICH JANUARY FOR SIX WAS CLEARLY SO. I WILL SEND THE WINNER. POSITIVENESS I'M A SOMEONE I'M I'M A WERE TO. IN THE BEGINNING- AND THE REASON I SAID THAT WAS- DRUDGERY WE KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT FUEL TO THIS INSURRECTION. THE MONTHS AND MONTHS OF LIES AND MISINFORMATION AND PROPAGANDA ON SOCIAL MEDIA- IT WAS DOMESTIC BUT WE ALSO KNOW. THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS HELPING TO FUND THAT. OF THAT NOT JUST OF. GOVERNMENT FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT IS COMPLETELY HOSTILE. TO DEMOCRACY TO OUR GOVERNMENT FOR GOVERNMENT THAT- IS NOW TRYING TO LOOK CONCORD. AND CARPET BOMB CIVILIANS IN A DEMOCRACY- AND THAT WE CAN COME OUT OF THE BLUE. RUSHES IN TALKING ABOUT THINGS AND TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME SO WE HAVE A BRUTAL FASCIST DICTATOR THAT'S TRYING TO CONQUER. A DEMOCRACY AND THAT SAME BRUTAL FASCIST DICTATOR WAS. USING HIS TROLL FARMS INTERNET TROLL FARMS TO TRY TO. FUEL THE PROPAGANDA THAT LED DIRECTLY TO THIS INSURRECTION SO IT'S NOT JUST. DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND INSURRECTION THAT WE SAW WE STILL ON JANUARY SIXTH IT WAS AN EFFORT BY A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO TOPPLE THE U. S. GOVERNMENT. IT'S JUST JUST TO REFLECT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS JOHN SKIPPER WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHARGES ONE APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION FROM MY COLLEAGUES I THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD AS A NATION. WITH A SHARED PATH THE SENATE OR CONGRESS THAT IS TO BE- IT'S TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIXTH AND AS COMPLICATED AS DIFFICULT AS THAT IS TO JUST TELL THE TRUTH- AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH AND ALL OF ITS COLORS. AND HAVING A VERY CLEAR DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IN A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A SOCIETY TO MOVE PAST THIS VIOLENT TREASONOUS ATTACK ON OUR GOVERNMENT- TO ME IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR COM AUGER- CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL MAJOR TWENTY TWO MOTION IS BE ADOPTED BRADFORD HI BRADFORD DIETRO BUG THAT VOTING IN A TROUBLED NOT VOTING COM MODERNIZE COME LONGER AYE SKINNER. SKINNER AYE WIENER WIENER AYE FOUR ZERO. MEASUREMENTS FOR VOTES AND HAS BEEN ADOPTED SO CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IT'S S. B. EIGHT THREE SIX BY CENTER WINNER HE'S GETTING PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE READY CENTER WINNER YOU MAY BEGIN. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES AFTER HEARING THIS BILL TODAY BUT IF THIS BILL MAY LOOK FAMILIAR SB EIGHT THIRTY SIX IS- IS THERE A RERUN OF A BILL THAT THIS COMMITTEE PASSED AND WAS. SIGNED INTO LAW A FEW YEARS BACK SENATE BILL SEVENTY FIVE UNFORTUNATELY SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE- EXPIRED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR SO WE ARE QUICKLY TRYING TO GET IT REAL AUTHORIZED AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS VERY SIMPLE. IT PROVIDES THAT WHEN- WHEN SOMEONE'S TESTIFYING IN COURT AN ATTORNEY CAN NOT. ASK THAT WITNESS QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS UNLESS THEIR FIRST ONE S. R. PRESENTED TO THE JUDGE. WHY THE QUESTION WOULD BE RELEVANT THANK GOD I AM THE JUDGE'S RULING THAT ITS RELEVANCE- THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE IMMIGRATION STATUS OF A WITNESS CAN BE RELEVANT TO A CASE THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT. TO THE TO THE CLAIM ITSELF FOR TO AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE ON HOWEVER WHAT WE- WE'RE SEEING AYE SITUATIONS WHERE A LAWYER WHICH HAS RANDOMLY ASK SOMEONE WHAT'S YUR IMMIGRATION STATUS ON WHICH CAN BE A FORM OF- INTIMIDATION. OF A WITNESS. FIVE AND- WITHOUT HAVING ANY RELEVANCE TO THE CASE AND WE KNOW THAT IN RECENT YEARS- THAT THAT ICE WAS IN COURT HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA- AND SO BY SENDING A SIGNAL THAT IF YOU. ARE A VICTIM OF A CRIME OR A WITNESS TO A CRIME OR A CIVIL WITNESS THAT IF YOU GO TO COURT THAT MIGHT CAUSE YOU TO GET DEPORTED BECAUSE SOMEONE'S GOING TO ASK YOU AND STANDS. ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS THAT'S- CHRIS HUGHTON'S SIDE OF FOR IMMIGRANTS NOT TO GO TO COURT- AND THAT UNDERMINES ALL OF OUR SAFETY- WE NEED. ALL RESIDENTS INCLUDING IMMIGRANTS INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN pSAFE REPORTING CRIMES IN GOING TO COURT. TO TESTIFY- SO AGAIN THIS DOES NOT PRECLUDE. ATTORNEYS FROM SEEKING TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS IF IT'S RELEVANT ALL THEY HAVE TO DO JUST LIKE IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIAL IF YOU WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE VICTIM'S SEXUAL HISTORY YOU CAN'T JUST ASK THOSE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO. PRESENTED-TO THE JUDGE FIRST EXPLAIN WHY IT'S RELEVANT AND THE JUDGE WILL RULE THE SUPPLIES A SIMILAR APPROACH- THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THREE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I SEE YOU HAVE TO LEAD WITNESSES ARE ON THE LINE WE HAVE DANIEL FELIZ AUTO. AM RESEARCH D. S. DENTAL SADO FROM THE L. A. T. IS OFFICE AND MERCED DHEAS FROM LEGAL AID AT WORK YES WILL AFFORD YOU FOUR MINUTES. TOTAL TWO MINUTES- WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TEMPLES OUT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS A SENATOR STATED- PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF SB SEVENTY FIVE THERE WERE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF ATTORNEYS DISCLOSING THE IMMIGRATION STATUS OF CRIME VICTIMS AND WITNESSES AND- CRIMINAL CASES. ADDITIONALLY UNDER THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION WE UNFORTUNATE HAD THE PRESENCE OF- IMMIGRATION AGENTS MAKING ARRESTS AT OUR CALIFORNIA COURTHOUSES COMBINED THIS CAUSED A TREMENDOUS A CHILLING EFFECT ON THAT THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES WILLINGNESS TO COME TO COURT AND TESTIFY. THE CHILLING EFFECT WAS SO GREAT THAT ARE CHIEF JUSTICE WROTE A LETTER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT IMMIGRATION AGENTS STAKING OUT CALIFORNIA COURT HOUSES. IN A LETTER TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE POINTED OUT THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS NEED TO HAVE SAFE ACCESS TO OUR COURTS WHEN I RESIDENTS FEEL APPREHENSION OR FEAR WHEN PARTICIPATING IN OUR- SYSTEM OF JUSTICE OUR COLLECTIVE PUBLIC SAFETY IS UNDERMINE. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ESPECIALLY UNDER DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS ARE VICTIMIZED AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE AFRAID TO COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS TO REPORT THAT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY NOT ONLY DOES IT. ALLOW THE PERPETRATOR OF THAT SPECIFIC CRIME TO GO UNPUNISHED BUT IT PUTS THAT COMMUNITY THE EVENGREATER RISK OF VICTIMIZATION. THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY UNDER THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION. I AM A VERY PUBLIC ISSUE I CAN TELL YOU IN MY EXPERIENCE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO PROSECUTING CASES- I HAD WITNESSED ATTORNEYS UNNECESSARILY ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WITNESSES IMMIGRATION STATUS IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE THEM FROM TESTIFYING IN COURT. IT COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE TO DO SO LIKE I SAY. ANYTHING THAT CREATES MORE FEAR IN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES DECREASES THEIR COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INCREASES VICTIMIZATION THAT'S WHY OUR OFFICE- IS SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING CO SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION AND AS THE SENATOR STATED. THE LEGISLATION AS WELL CRAFTED IT DOES ALLOW FOR THE USE OF QUESTIONING. ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS WHEN IT'S RELEVANT- AND ALSO TO POINT OUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LEGISLATION PROHIBITS A PERSON OR THEIR ATTORNEY FROM VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSING THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS- TO THE COURT. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND URGE THE COMMITTEE TO RE ENACT THIS LEGISLATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY. RESIDENTS OF THIS STATUTE WHILE IT WAS IN EFFECT A LIEU VIRTUALLY ELIMINATING ANY. USE OF THE UNNECESSARY QUESTIONING ABOUT A VICTIM OR WITNESSES IMMIGRATION AND CRIMINAL COURTS SO JUST THE MERE PRESENCE OF THIS ON THE STATUTES WILL. SERVE ITS INTENDED PURPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT UP IS MERCER DIAZ. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MAY THIRTIETH AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK A NONPROFIT LEGAL ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES FOR THE EMPLOYMENT RATE OF LOW WAGE WORKERS. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY THE CO SPONSOR AND TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB EIGHT THIRTY SIX. I ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR WIENER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. SB EIGHT THIRTY SIX EIGHT THIRTY SIX WILL INSURE IMMIGRATION STATUS INFORMATION CANNOT BE USED AS A TOOL OF INTIMIDATION THAT WOULD TELL ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR THE MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS FROM CALIFORNIA'S HOME AS THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS HAS RECOGNIZED CALIFORNIA LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS QUOTE LEAVE NO ROOM FOR DOUBT ABOUT THE STATE'S PUBLIC POLICY WITH REGARD. TO THE IRRELEVANCE OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AN ENFORCEMENT OF THE STATE LABOR EMPLOYMENT AND A VARIETY OF OTHER LARGE SH DESPITE THE RELEVANT THE MIGRATION STATUS TO EMPLOYERS LIABILITY UNDER CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT LINE INCLUDES TWO OCT IN A TIME TO DISCOVER AND DISCLOSE THE STATUS THROUGH THE LITIGATION PROCESS AS A WAY TO TURN WORKERS FROM ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN A CASE THAT WAS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF AN IMMIGRANT WORKER WHO HAD WORKED FOR YOUR EMPLOYER FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS ONLY TO BE TERMINATED DAYS AFTER EXERCISING. HIS WORKERS COMPENSATION RIGHT. DURING THE READING IT INTEREST ANY RELEVANT IMMIGRATION STATUS THESE TYPES OF INCREASE ALLOWING PLAYERS TO REYES IMPLICITLY THE THREAT OF DEPORTATION AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION EVERY TIME A WORKER WHETHER DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED FILED AN EMPLOYMENT ACTION. THIS IS THE SAME PER DISCLOSURE THAT THE STATUS IN OPEN COURT IN EITHER INCIDENT THAT CAUSES COUNTLESS ACTS OF ILLEGAL AND REPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT TO GO AND REPORTED TO ROADS STANDARDS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA WORKERS SHOULD BE ABLE RESPECTFUL ENSURE THAT WORKERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS CAN ACCESS OUR COURT.
