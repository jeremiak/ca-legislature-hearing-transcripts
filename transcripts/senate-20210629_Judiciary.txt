FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING TO COMMITTING AMENDMENTS AND THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. THESE AMENDMENTS WILL ONE CAPPED A DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THE COST OF LIABILITY COVERAGE TO EXTEND DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THREE REQUIRE NOTICE TO USERS ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF E. DEVICES THESE AMENDMENTS WILL ADDRESS INSURANCE COSTS AND DISCLOSE CONCERNS BY SIX BY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE COST OF COVERAGE FOR ACCIDENT VICTIMS AS WELL AS ENSURE EACH DEVICE RENTERS. ARE MADE AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING ENGAGEMENT WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS WE AIM TO ENSURE PEDESTRIANS RECEIVE A SENSIBILITY AND LIABILITY PROTECTIONS. A. B. THREE SEVEN ONE EXTENDS LIABILITY PROTECTION TO PEDESTRIANS IF THEY ARE INJURED BY AN ELECTRIC ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR BIKE COLLECTIVELY CALLED P. DEVICES AND REQUIRES THE ADDITION OF BRAILLE AND TACTILE SIGNET BUS SIGNAGE TO THESE DEVICES. THIS ENSURES PEDESTRIANS WHO ARE BLIND OR GRAB VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS HAVE THE CONTACT INFORMATION TO FILE AN INJURY REPORT. IF THEY WOULD EXPERIENCE AN ACCIDENT SUCH AS TRIPPING OVER AN ABANDONED P. DEVICE ON THE SIDEWALK. MY FIRST APPROACH BY THE BILL'S SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND I IMMEDIATELY REACHED OUT TO MY BABY BROTHER. DR FRED JONES AS HE IS ALSO BLIND. I RECALL A TIME WHEN HE CAME TO MY WEDDING AND I TOOK HIM TO THE BATHROOM AND HE HEARD ME TURN THE LIGHT OFF. TURN THE LIGHT ON SKEWS ME TO WHICH HE SAID WHY DID YOU DO THAT I CAN'T SEE ANYWAYS. IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT WHERE I REALIZED THAT TO UNDERSTAND ISSUES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND. YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR EYES OPEN ALL THE TIME YOU MUST ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE. TO BE BLIND. THE USER'S CURRENT DO YOU THE CURRENT USE WE ARE FACING IS THAT EXISTING LIABILITY PROTECTIONS ONLY COVER USERS. INJURED AS A RESULT OF OPERATING E. DEVICES THIS MEANS PEDESTRIANS AND ACCIDENT VICTIMS INJURED BY EACH DEVICES ARE LEFT WITHOUT A METHOD TO RECEIVE COVERAGE FOR INJURIES CAUSED BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY BURDENSOME TO THOSE WHO ARE BLIND OR HAVE VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS THAT THEY RELY ON CLEAR WALKWAYS. DOES IT MATTER BOTH UPSET ACCESSIBILITY AND EQUITY FOR ALL EIGHTY THREE SEVEN ONE REMOVE REMOVED THE BURDEN RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM ACCIDENT VICTIMS BY ENSURING PEDESTRIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE BLIND. THE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE A METHOD FOR PARLIAMENTARY REPORT AND BEING COMPENSATED IF INJURED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL'S IMPROPER USE OR STORAGE OF THE DEVICES. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF A. B. THREE SEVEN ONE. IT'S ACTUALLY MY BROTHER'S DOCTOR FRED JONES ALSO IN SUPPORT BECAUSE- IS VIA TELECONFERENCE LINE IS LAURIE KASSNER WITH BILL SPONSORED THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. THANK. YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS ARE EXPECT POLICE ASKED FOR AND I BOTH. THANK A SALUTE BROTHER DR FRED JONES IS PRESENT HERE IN THE GALLERY AND MISS LORI KASSNER IS ON THE PHONE IS THAT CORRECT. ALL RIGHT- SO DR JONES- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THE FLOOR IS YOURS. SURE. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS BILL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO THANK MY BROTHER FOR HIS TIRELESS EFFORT IN TRYING TO GET THIS BILL THROUGH THIS BILL WILL REVOLUTIONIZE AS WELL AS- I HAVE DISABLED PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE INJURED. BY LEAVING SCOOTERS ON THE SIDEWALK IF A BLIND PERSON ENCOUNTERS A SCOOTER ON THE SIDEWALK THEY- WILL LOSE THE ORIENTATION AND MAY MOVE TO THE LEFT OR TO THE RIGHT WHICH WOULD BRING TO THE INDUSTRY. WHICH WOULD ALSO RENDER THEM AND ABLE TO GET HIT BY A CAR SO IF YOU CONSIDER THIS BILL CAREFULLY WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THEIR TWO AREAS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER IS BUILT UNDER. ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS AND ATTITUDINAL BARRIERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU UGH DR JONES MISCAST ARE YOU AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE. YES I AM ALL RIGHT FLOORS NO YEARS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HEARING MY COMMENTS- I LIVE IN OAKLAND I'M TOTALLY BLIND AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND ON DECEMBER SIXTEENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN I CROSS THE STREET IN FRONT OF MY HOME WALKED ABOUT FIFTY FEET DOWN THE BLOCK AND SUDDENLY WAS LYING FLAT ON MY FACE. I HAD CAUGHT MY RIGHT FOOT UNDER A SHARED SCOOTER WELL MY WHITE CANE MOVED IN FRONT OF MY LEFT FOOT AND I FELT. I WAS SO SHAKEN AND DISORIENTED I LET A PASSER BY WALKED ME HOME I REALIZED THAT I HAD A LARGE CUT ON MY FOREHEAD I NORMALLY BANDAGE SMALL MYSELF BUT KNEW I NEEDED THEIR HELP WITH THIS ONE SO GUARDED NEIGHBORS ASSISTANCE TO APPLY GAUZE AND BANDAGES. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF A SHARED SCOOTER UNTIL THIS MISHAP SO I DID NOT MAKE A POLICE REPORT AND DID NOT THINK OF GOING TO URGENCY. I THOUGHT ONLY OF GETTING HOME. BY LATER THAT DAY AS WELL AS THE BANDAGE CUT I HAD TWO VERY BLACK GUYS AT A GREATLY SWOLLEN NOSE. MY INJURIES TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS TO HEAL AND TO THIS DAY THE TEXTURE OF THE SKIN ON MY FOREHEAD IS SLIGHTLY ROUGHENED. LATER THAT FIRST DAY I LEARNED ABOUT SHARED SCOOTERS AND THEY'RE BEING ABANDONED AND UNSAFE PLACES SUCH AS SIDEWALKS. THEIR WAYS AND EVEN THROWN INTO LAKE MERRITT A LARGE LAKE IN OAKLAND. NOW I KNOW THE VEHICLES CAN BE HAZARDOUS. TODAY IF I ENCOUNTERED A SHARED SCOOTER IN UNSAFE LOCATIONS I WOULD BE APPRECIATIVE. I WOULD APPRECIATE BRAILLE IDENTIFICATION ON THE VEHICLE I WOULD BE GRATEFUL. THAT THE CARRIER WAS REQUIRED TO HAVE LIABILITY INSURANCE. THANK YOU FOR THIS A BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO COMMENT TODAY. THANK YOU MISS KASSNER LET ME JUST MAKE A HOUSEKEEPING ANNOUNCEMENT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING IN QUEUE TO TESTIFY ON ON VARIOUS BILLS- SO.

NINE SEVEN FOUR THEN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WICKS FOR AB ONE FOUR FIVE FIVE THANK YOU. THAT INDULGENCE ALL RIGHT. SO WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM TWO WITNESSES HERE PRIMARY WITNESSES- NOW RETURN TO OTHERS TO GIVE US THEIR NAME THEIR AFFILIATION AND THEIR POSITION SO ANYONE OF THE GALLERY WITH THAT WISHES TO TESTIFY. HERE SAYING NO ONE IN THE GALLERY. NOW LET'S MOVE TO ROOM ONE TWELVE. SIR WANT A ROOM TWELVE NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA TURN THE PHONE LINES NOW. FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF A. B. THREE SEVEN ONE. MODERATOR IF YOU COULD TO HELP THOSE IN SUPPORT OF A. B. THREE SEVEN ONE. CERTAINLY MR SHARE QUEUE UP AT THIS TIME IN SUPPORT OF A. B. THREE SEVENTY ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN IF. ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AT THIS TIME. AND AFTER ALLOWING A FEW MOMENTS FOR THOSE TO QUEUE UP NO ONE HAS DONE SO AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT LET'S NOW TURN TO OPPOSITION OPPOSITION TO A. B. THREE SEVEN ONE IS THERE ANYONE THE GALLERY THAT WISHES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION THERE ARE- THERE MR BRETT MULLER- IS THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION- SMALLER NOT GARY NOT ROOM ONE TWELVE MISTER MALL ARE YOU ON THE PHONE. HI MISTER CHAIR YEP I'M ON THE PHONE ALL RIGHT SMALL FLOOR'S YOURS. GREAT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRETT MILLER SENIOR PUBLIC POLICY MANAGER AT FANFARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION BABY THREE SEVENTY ONE. WE APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE OTHER STAFF TO TRY AND FIND A SOLUTION TO BE CLEAR WE SUPPORT THE ADDITION OF BRAILLE ON ALL DEVICES I DO NOT DISPUTE THE OTHER CONTENT WITH THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENT. WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO IMPROVING SAFETY FOR PEDESTRIANS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH VISUAL ARE CUT ABILITY ISSUES HOWEVER DESPITE THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AND THE CANADIAN OUT THAT MUCH REMAINS OUTSTANDING THERE'S NOT SUFFICIENT DATA AT THE TIME I DON'T TURN THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENT. TO JUSTIFY THE PROPOSED INSURANCE REQUIREMENT IN THE BILL WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROPOSED AMENDED POLICY LIMIT PACIFIC WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND PER OCCURRENCE FOR SCOOTERS FOR THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND PER CAR THERE'S SIMPLY NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE CAKE THE TUTORS ARE SIX AND A HALF TIMES MORE DANGEROUS TO PEDESTRIANS. AND CARS REGARDING OUR EXISTING INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ALL SHARED. BY PROVIDERS ALREADY HAVE ROBUST COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE THAT COVERS WRITER INTRODUCTORY AND THEN ACCIDENTS WHERE WE AT THE DEVICE OWNERS ARE NEGLIGENT IN THIS CASE D. B. THREE SEVENTY ONE GOES MUCH FURTHER INCREASES ON PRESIDENT INSURANCE MANDATE THAT. TRADITIONAL BY ABILITY AS WRITTEN EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY ONE REQUIRES MICHAEL BILITY COMPANY TO OBTAIN THIRD PARTY INSURANCE WHICH IN EFFECT WOULD MAKE US LIABLE FOR THE NEGLIGENCE OR RECKLESSNESS OF OUR WRITERS REMARKABLY DIDN'T EVEN COVER HE DIDN'T HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT OVER HERE WHERE WE AS OPERATORS HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER. BUT JUST SOMEONE RIDING A SCOOTER WHILE INTOXICATED AND IMPORTANTLY TRACKING A PEDESTRIAN NO OTHER COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MODEL CALLS THIS APPROACH BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE RIGHTLY HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS WHEN YOU RENT A CAR IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE DRIVERS ARE REQUIRED TO HOLD THIRD PARTY INSURANCE THAT COVERS THE INJURY TO OTHERS. YOU DON'T TO THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY FOR DAMAGES EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY ONE WOULD CHANGETHAT THAT IS WHY THE ONLY INSURE CHARACTER OF EACH GOOD OR THANK YOU BYE IN CALIFORNIA APOLLO AS STATED IN WRITING THAT THIS BILL WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY CHANGED THE RISK PROFILE FOR MICROBIOLOGY OPERATOR. IN CALIFORNIA AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT A ALWAYS ONE TO PROVIDE COVERAGE. IN THIS WAY. WE BELIEVE. TREAT THEM ONE A BARELY THINK OUT THIS WITH.INDUSTRY WELL WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THREE SEVEN ONE ISN'T TO GET COVER AND RARE CASES. THE DEATH. IF CLEAN AND JERK AND THE NEGLIGENT WRITER HAS NO ASSETS. THIS BILL RAISES MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WRITER TO BEHAVE RECKLESSLY BREAKING NUMEROUS LAWS INTERPRET ESTRIN WOULD NOT BE HELD FINANCIALLY LIABLE UP FRONT FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THIS SWEEPING INDUSTRY MANDATE ALSO CREATE MORAL HAZARD OR MICRO MOBILITY COMPANIES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CASH PAYOUT FOR WRITER ACTION BEYOND OUR CONTROL. LASTLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THIS INSURANCE MANDATE. ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY KEEP IN MIND OUR AVERAGE TRIP COST ONLY FOR FIVE DOLLARS. EVEN AN EXTRA DOLLARS THAT 25% INCREASE. IT EXPECTED IMPACT ON ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY IS WHY THE CITY OF SAN JOSE OAKLAND AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS WITH THE SPELL. FINALLY AS A LEGAL MATTER D. B. THREE SEVENTY ONE ALSO POTENTIALLY VIOLATE THE FEDERAL BRAZEN AND THAT WHICH PRECLUDES RENTAL CAR COMPANIES FROM BEING HELD. LIABLE FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY RENDERS THE VEHICLE. FOR THESE REASONS WE TOGETHER WITH OTHER SCOOTER OPERATORS CITY BIKE ADVOCATES AND OTHERS REMAIN OPPOSED TO FIGHT THE COMMITTEE ON THE NET. THE CRUX OF THAT AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT LIABILITY SHOULD FALL WHO IS AT FAULT. AND THEREFORE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR RECKLESS OR NEGLIGENT WRITER BEHAVIOR BEYOND THE CONTROL. UNFORTUNATELY A. B. THREE SEVENTY ONE ACCURATE AND UP AND TOUCH LEGAL PRECEDENT AND TREAT MICHAEL MOBILITY DIFFERENTLY COMPARED TO ANY OTHER RENTED OR SHARED PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MR MILLER- BUT- I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN PROBLEM WITNESS OPPOSITION I LET YOU USE UP MOST OF THE- TWO MINUTES YOU'RE TWO MINUTES PLUS. ANYONE ELSE'S TWO MINUTES SO- IF THERE IS ANYONE IN THE GALLERY WISHES TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO. AB THREE SEVENTY ONE PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE SAYING NON ROOM ONE TWELVE. THING NO ONE ROOM ONE TWELVE ALL RIGHT MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD QUEUE UP THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO AB THREE SEVENTY ONE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE YOUR VOICES KNOWN. REGARDING OPPOSITION A. B. THREE SEVEN ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THAT'S ONE TO SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. WHEN I THINK ABOUT HALF OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE BUT THEN I PUT A LOT THE MINUTE POSITION ON EIGHTY THREE TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU. AND WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THAT'S. ONE THREE TWO. INSURING THE MEMBERS SOME. ONLINE YEAH I COULD HAVE A MUCH NEEDED POSITION WAS A PART OF THE PLANET SIX NINE. NEGATIVE ACTIVITY HOWEVER HAD. BEEN ASSERTING THAT ARM RD THANK YOU. OUR NEXT. AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE IN OPPOSITION AT ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE ON THE PHONE LINE MODERATOR. NO NO ONE ELSE ON THE PHONE LINE ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAMBER I SEE SENATOR BOARD JUST MIKE IS RACE AND A COUPLE EURO ALSO. PERSONAL BORDERS. THANK YOU CHAIR. I WAS IN A IN SAN DIEGO AWHILE BACK. AND SOMEONE SCOOTER CAME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE- MY KIDS AND IT CAUSED ME YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AS A PARENT I WAS CONCERNED- BUT THEN YOU KNOW AS THE MINUTES IN THE HOURS WENT BY AND JUST KIND OF CURIOUS ON HOW. THIS BUSINESS MODEL EXISTS AND LO AND BEHOLD THIS BILL. FOUND ITS WAY OVER HERE- I KNOW THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT- HE IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND HE'S TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING I THINK ON THEIR MANY COMPONENTS IN THIS THAT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN YOU LEAVE A SCOOTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALKWAY THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE ARE YOU KNOW WITH DISABILITIES- WHEN YOU LEAVE IT- YOU KNOW PARKED IN. IN DANGER SOCIETIES OR ANY VARIATION. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME IMPROVEMENT WITH THE SCOOTER COMPANIES AND THOSE THAT USE THOSE- PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE. A DEGREE OF EXPECTATION INCOMPETENCE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW THE IMPACT TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE WORLD AROUND THEM- BY VIRTUE OF USING THOSE SERVICES. SO JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- TO LOSE SOME OF THE GOOD THINGS THE BRAILLE ISSUE I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT WE'RE IN THE COURSE OF A OF A OF A LEGISLATIVE CYCLE WHERE AMENDMENTS ARE BEING THROWN QUICKLY AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING. SAID MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WAS A NEW CAP ON THE INSURANCE- POLICY AMOUNT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE I THINK IN MY DRAFT IS THAT I'M A MILLION. BUT I THINK THAT'S GOING ON WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND. HUNDRED THOUSAND SO IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT AFTER TALKING WITH BOTH SIDES ON THIS ISSUE THAT THERE THIS MIGHT BE A SITUATION WHERE- THERE COULD BE EVEN FURTHER COMPROMISE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT FORWARD A MANDATE FOR A THIRD PARTY LIABILITY POLICY. INHABIT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU COULD VERY WELL FORCE OUT THE BUSINESS ITSELF MEANING THAT ITS BUSINESS MODEL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE- THAT TYPE OF OVERHEAD ON A PER OCCURRENCE AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT YOU CAN'T JUST. NOT ALLOW FOR SOME PROTECTIONS INTO WHERE EXACTLY IS THAT- THAT SWEET SPOT THAT HAS YET TO BE% DETERMINED BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE MAY BE SQUEEZING OUT THIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE SOME UTILITY- BY VIRTUE OF THIS INSURANCE POLICY AND I KNOW IN THE PAST THE MUNICIPALITIES THAT WERE POSED WITH A COVERAGE REQUEST. MEAN THE MUNICIPALITIES OPPOSED IT AS WELL- SO I WAS WONDERING IMAGE THROW THIS OUT THERE TO THE AUTHOR. WHAT IF WE WERE. TO COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE THAT IDENTIFIES. A SET DOLLAR AMOUNT. EVERY TIME SOMEBODY OPENS AN ACCOUNT TO ARBOR TIME SOMEBODY USES- THE SCOOTER THAT THERE BE IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR CHARGE A SURCHARGE. LET'S SEE SEVENTY FIVE CENTS OR A DOLLAR WHAT WHATEVER IT MAY BE THAT GOES INTO A VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND. SO ESSENTIALLY BECOMES A COMPENSATION FUND TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED. AND NEED TO HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS ARE FOR WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED BUT IT DOESN'T UNDO THE BUSINESS MODEL AND RUN THE ENTIRE SCOOTER INDUSTRY OUT OF BUSINESS AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF- I MIGHT BE IN THE COMMENTS IF THAT'S MORE OF A QUESTION AT THIS POINT MISTER CHAIR. OFF I COULD DIRECT IT TO THE AUTHOR IF HE WOULD BE HIS THOUGHTS ON THAT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO CONSIDER THAT FURTHER SURE BUT LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR OF. PHONE NUMBER DO YOU CARE TO RESPOND NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES BUT LET ME RESPOND NOW ALL RIGHT- AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR AMENDMENTS THAT BROUGHT IT DOWN. TO THAT NUMBER AND I BELIEVE SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM- WE NEED TO HAVE SOME DOLLAR AMOUNT AND WITHOUT. WITHOUT SOME DATA WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT AT SOME COST. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS NOT I REPEAT NOT TO PUT THIS GROUP IS THIS OUT OF BUSINESS. AND IN FACT WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS BECOMES A MITIGATING PART OF IT BECAUSE MY THE MEMBERS FROM LA MAY KNOW- THERE ARE ATTORNEYS. WHO ARE NOW HAVE COMMERCIALS OUT TO SUE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INJURED BY STEVE B. DEVICES AND SCOOTERS WHICH I THINK WILL BE EVEN MORE DRASTICALLY IMPACT THAT INDUSTRY I THINK THIS BILL PROVIDING SOME KIND OF INSURANCE COULD BUFFER SOME OF THAT AND SO WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER. TO ENSURE THAT THIS DESCRIPTIVE GO OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE. SAME BEST INTENTIONS AS I DO A THE KEEP THIS GROUP. IN IN BUSINESS I DON'T KNOW I'VE HAVE TO LOOK AT. THE MODEL YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT IS HOW YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS BUT- DEFINITELY WHO IT IS IF THE SCOOTER COMPANIES WILL WORK WITH US LOOK WHEN I FIRST TOLD US THERE WERE NO INSURANCE COMPANIES WE HAD TO GO FIND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE CARRIERS FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY SAID THEY WOULD DO IT. NOW YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN STYMIED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY TO GET THIS DONE AND SO FROM MY CLIENTS ARE MY PEOPLE I'M REPRESENTING PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED THEY JUST WANT TO BE ABLE. TO GET THEIR INJURIES- COMPENSATED FOR HER WELL THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTIC TO HEAR I'M GLAD YOU WERE YOU WERE OPENED ON TO- TO THIS AS AN IDEA I KNOW THAT- THE SCOOTER COMPANIES SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT THIS FURTHER- I THINK THIS IS GOING TO GO TO INSURANCE NEXT FOR ME BETWEEN NOW AND THEN- THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE- LOOKED INTO IN GREATER DETAIL. THE OTHER THING IS- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE PREMIUMS OF INSURANCE I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN ANY ESTIMATE BY AN INSURANCE CARRIER. ON WHAT OVERHEAD THAT WOULD BE. THE I THINK IS GOING TO BE SSENTIAL BEFORE LIKE THIS ALSO MOVES FORWARD. ON TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE IS THAT IF THE SCOOTER COMPANY SAYING IT'S COST PROHIBITIVE. I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT SEE IT ESTIMATE OR IF IN YOUR CASE YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT IS DOABLE I'D LOVE TO SEE AN ESTIMATE. ON WHAT TYPE OF- KERRIER LIKE REDUCTIONS. BECAUSE WE ARE ELEVATING. THE- THE ARRANGEMENT. BETWEEN FIVE THE SCOOTER RENTER DISCOVER COMPANY IN A THIRD PARTY IN WAYS THAT CERTAINLY DON'T EXIST. S. COUNTERPARTS TO RENTING A VEHICLE. AND I THINK IF WE CAN ANSWER THOSE TOO THEN I THINK WE- HAVE SOMETHING HERE THAT CAN WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND LOOK AFTER THE FOLKS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AFTER A SPECIALLY THOSE IN THE DESERT WITH DISABILITIES. BECAUSE I THINK IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT A PERSON COULD BE INJURED. AND HAVE NO ONE TO GO AFTER IT DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE NOT THE COMPANY NOT THE INDIVIDUAL PRESUMABLY THE INDIVIDUAL. WHO IS RENTING- MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE DEEPEST POCKETS GIVEN POTENTIAL MEDICAL. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANTIAL INJURIES TO SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THERE SO FOR YOUR MAN YOUR WORD I HOPE THAT THESE SCOOTER COMPANIES WILL WILL REACH OUT TO YOU IN YOU'LL DISCUSS THIS AS AN OPTION BECAUSE I THINK. A COMPENSATION FUND COULD GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN THE PUBLIC WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE ENTITY TO CONTINUE TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED- TO BE ABLE TO SEEK ECONOMIC REMEDY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR FOR JUST A SECOND HERE THAN SAID HERZBERG CYNICAL EURO. SO THANK MR CHAIR- MY QUESTIONS ARE MY THE ISSUES THAT I AM I THAT I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM TO ME JUST SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BELT AND- HI I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK- MY ONLY CONCERN WAS WITH THE THEM THE SIZE OF THE INSURANCE- AT POLICIES AND I GUESS I LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF- A MOVING VEHICLE AND WHAT'S AT THE MINIMUM WE HAVE TO HAVE AND BY MOVING AT. A CAR OR A VAN- IT WILL DO A LOT MORE DAMAGE POTENTIALLY THEN THIS KIND OF- VEHICLE WHEN IT'S MOVING SO BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT TO INSURANCE IT'S GOING TO GO TO INSURANCE MY AND ACTUALLY THE ISSUES ARE RELATED TO INSURANCE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND I GUESS AS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS- I WAS WONDERING HOW DO WE DEAL WITH OTHER MOVING. VEHICLES THAT WE RENT WHETHER THEIR SKIS YOU KNOW SNOW SKIS OR WATER SKIS OR THOSE THAT. DID THE DUES ON THE WATER- SKI DOOS THAT- THE OUT BICYCLES. BOATS EIGHT I MEAN THERE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE. LIKE WE OUGHTA JUST LUMP THEM ALL TOGETHER AND SAY LET'S FIGURE OUT. A DANGEROUS SPORT ACT LIKE YOU KNOW A COVERAGE AND THEY REQUIRE SOME KIND OF WRITER THAT WOULD COVER A LOT OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE I'M- I'M- I THINK THERE THERE SHOULD BE INSURANCE. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE BUT- AND I LIKE THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT- THE SENATOR THE GOOD SENATOR FROM FRESNO PROPOSED I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER IDEAS SOME SELF SELF FUNDED. OR OR- FUNDED MECHANISM AND MAYBE IT YOU PAY THE SEVENTY FIVE CENTS OR A DOLLAR AND IT COMES TO A STATEWIDE- FIND THAT THEN IS USED FOR. A LIKE A VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND SOMETHING THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE DEVICES THAT PEOPLE ARE RENTING GET COVERED IN THAT THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYBODY THAT'S INJURED. BECAUSE-OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE OPERATOR GETS COVERED AND THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO DO THAT SO I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I'M IN THE SPORT OF TODAY. I JUST PUT PROPOSE THOSE AS WAYS TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE MAKING SURE WE'RE WE'RE REALLY CAPTURING- AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET PEOPLE INSURED IN AND- SOMEBODY WHO. IS RENTING. THE DEVICE AND IS NEGLIGENT WITH IT WHETHER THEY LEAVE IT ON THE SIDEWALK OR THEY RUN SOMEBODY OVER CAN'T JUST SAY LOOK I DON'T HAVE ANY ASSETS RIGHT I'M A I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING YOU CAN TAKE MY COMPUTER AND THAT'S IT I'M WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MONEY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE INJURED SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THANKS BYE. THANK YOU SAID A COUPLE YEARS- THE CELL NUMBER JOHN SIR DO YOU. WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND BETTER IN YOUR CLOTHES. I DO MY COWORKERS ARE APPRECIATE HER THANK YOU LOLA CENTER HERTZBERG. MAN I'M GETTING OLD EVERYBODY BECAUSE I'VE SEEN A LOT OF BILLS BUT- SCOOTERS IT'S A NEW THING THE WORLD KEEPS CHANGING IT'S IMPORTANT THING I'M TOLD OUT IN CAL STATE CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE WHERE. PEOPLE PARK AND THEY GO THE LAST MILE ON THOSE SCOOTERS HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT DEAL YOU KNOW ALL THESE KIDS ARE AROUND SCOOTERS ABOUT HIT ME HALF THE TIME I THINK WHEN I GET TO THIS JOB AND BECOME A SCOOTER LAWYER AT THESE. RATES OF- MATURE AND SPLIT. BUT NO LUCK HE HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE IS IT SERIOUS- FELL IN THE- YOUR FRIEND OF MINE FOR. MORE YEARS THAN EITHER OF US WANT TO KNOW. BUT I THINK I JUST WANTED TO SAY IS THAT I JUST THINK THE NUMBERS ARE. UP YOU GOT TO HAVE A THIRD PARTY PAY RIGHT WHEN THERE'S ANY LEVEL OF LIABILITY BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN IRAN WHEN THESE THINGS I'M SCARED I'LL FALL OFF OF IT. WELL THE PEOPLE THAT RUN THEM ARE KIDS GOT NODE YOU GOT NO MONEY. SO CLEARLY IF THIS CAN SOMEONE GETS INJURED YOU GOTTA HAVE A SOURCE ADULT. THE QUESTION IS. THAT'S A DEFINED TERM MISTER CHAIRMAN. BUT THE- YOU GOTTA MAKE SURE ISN'T ALWAYS IS SET IS A SURCHARGE OR IS IT A- INSURANCE. FUND IN EITHER INSTANCE- YOU KNOW IT'S A QUESTION'S GOING TO RAISE THE COST OF THE PRODUCT WHICH- AT WHAT POINT WHAT IS IT COMPETITIVE WE'RE NOT COMPETITIVE. BUT I JUST THINK THE NUMBERS THAT. THE COVERAGE HERE YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN MENTIONED NOW BUNCH OF TIMES AND I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS TODAY. BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT THIS INTO THE ETHER OF THE DISCUSSION I SUSPECT IT'LL GET DISCUSSED IN. INSURANCE BUT IF YOU'RE IN A CAR OR IF YOU'RE A MINIMUM AMOUNTS IN YOUR CARS WITH THIRTY GRAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND OR SOMETHING IN THIS IS MUCH HIGHER. YOU KNOW IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT THE AUTOMOBILE- LIABILITY. LIMITS SHOULD INFORM THE THINKING HERE OR THE NATURE OF THE RISK SHOULD INFORM THE THINKING AND I KNOW THAT THE OFFICE AS THAT I JUST. THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO MENTION IT THE DISCUSSION OF THE SUPPORTING HIM. BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS WE TALK TO INSURANCE WE'VE GOT ATTACHED TO SOME OF THOSE LIMITS. AND HOW THE FUNDING HAPPENS BUT THERE HAS TO BE A FUND AS A CENTER CUBBY- SAYS. OF SOME SORTS WHETHER IT'S INSURANCE FUNDED OR OTHERWISE FUNDED. BUT THE NUMBERS NEED TO REFLECT. THE RISK BUT TO SOCIETY I THINK THE NUMBERS ARE JUST WAY OUT OF WHACK THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG I CAN. EMPATHIZE WITH YOUR COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE NEW ADVANCED FORMS OF. MOBILITY BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE IN LUCK BECAUSE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY NINE DEALS WITH EQUESTRIAN SAFETY SO IT'LL BE MORE ALONG THE LINES OF. SOMETHING YOU'RE FAMILIAR. WITH- ALL RIGHT. TURNING NOW TO. SENATOR ALL. I JUST THIS ISN'T A SOLUTION BUT WHAT MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED IS THAT THIS IS PART OF THE GIG ECONOMY NOW WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE THE BRICKS AND MORTARS YOU DRIVE UP YOU KNOW YOU GO UP TO A BICYCLE RENTAL YOU KNOW WHO THE COMPANY IS YOU KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. THIS GIG MAKES IT ALL VERY NEBULOUS BAKES AT ALL VERY CONFUSING AS TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT AND THE ORIGINAL COMPANY DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE USER OR ANYONE THAT THEY BUMP INTO OR CAUSE TO FALL DOWN THE KNIFE TO BRING IT BACK TO US TO SOLVE IT IS A REACTION TO SOMETHING NOT BEING THOUGHT ABOUT HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE BY THESE VERY COMPANIES. THEY WANT TO CREATE IT THEY WANT TO MAKE THE PROFIT OUT OF IT BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT AND THEY SHOULD VERY EASILY THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A MOMENT IN WHICH THIS IS GOING TO BE TAKEN UP WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE INJURED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO IF YOU LEAVE IT UP TO US TO PUT IT.

MAY NOT BE BY PASSED IF A PARENT WITH A DRUG ADDICTION SUFFERS A RELAPSE. AFTER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING DRUG TREATMENT. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY NEARLY 80% OF CALIFORNIANS MET THE CRITERIA FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. RELAPSES ARE A REGULAR OCCURRENCE IN REHABILITATION JOURNEYS INCLUDING AN INDIVIDUAL'S ACTIVELY SEEKING TREATMENT. THE FAMILY BECOMES INVOLVED WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THEY SHOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY LOSE ACCESS TO REUNIFICATION SERVICES IF A PARENT HAS RELAPSED. THIS BILL PASSED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY UNANIMOUSLY AND IS NO OPPOSITION. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF A. B. SEVEN A. EIGHT R. JULIA HANNIGAN FROM DEPENDENCY LEGAL SERVICES AND AT HOWARD FROM THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE. THANK YOU BOB MISS HANNIGAN IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE OR MISTER HOWARD ON THE PHONE. NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN. THANK YOU- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JULIE AND AGAIN I AM RELIEVED PARENTS TOURNEY IN CINEMA COUNTY AND POLICY DIRECTOR WITH DEPENDENCY LEGAL SERVICES. DEPENDENCY LEGAL SERVICES REPRESENT PARENTS AND CHILDREN IN CHILD WELFARE PROCEEDINGS IN EIGHT COUNTIES ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT. I HAVE YOUR ANALYSIS CORRECTLY SUMMARIZES CALIFORNIA LAW GREATLY EMPHASIZES KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER AND CHILDREN OUT OF FOSTER CARE IF POSSIBLE. THIS IS WHY. WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO FAMILY INCLUDING DRUG TREATMENT TO GIVE PARENTS A CHANCE TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES TOGETHER. WE KNOW THAT RELAPSE IS PART OF RECOVERING FROM THIS DISEASE. RELAPSING AFTER MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN DRUG TREATMENT IS DEEMED TO BE THE EQUIVALENT OF REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE IN DRUG TREATMENT ALTOGETHER THEN WE BY LAW MAKE THE PERSON'S NEEDS FOR SERVICES A BASIS FOR DENYING THEM THE VERY SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. WITH THE RESULT THAT FAMILIES THAT COULD BE PRESERVED ARE NEVER GIVEN THAT CHANCE. AND THAT'S WHAT EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT IS ABOUT A CHANCE. PARENTS OFFERING FROM THE ADDICTION STILL HAVE. YOU DO WELL ENOUGH IN DRUG TREATMENT TO PROVE TO A JUDGE THAT IT IS SAFE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR CHILDREN BACK EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT DOES NOT CHANGE THAT. IT JUST SAYS THAT A RELAPSE DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFY YOU FROM GETTING BACK TO YOU. THE CHANCE TO GET HELP TO GET YOUR CHILDREN BACK IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

YOU HAVE EIGHT ZERO SO FAR WITH THE MEMBERS MISSED MISSING ALL RIGHT WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL NEXT IS AB NINE ZERO ONE AND BEFORE YOU PRESENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COLORADO- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING YOU'VE AGREED TO AMEND THE BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR TO INCLUDE THE- AUTOMOBILE RENTERS CHILDREN OR PERSONS FOR WHOM THE RENTER IS A LEGAL GUARDIAN PROVIDED THEY MEET THE RENTAL CAR COMPANIES OTHER REQUIREMENTS TO THE CATEGORY OF DRIVERS WHO CAN DRIVE A RENTAL CAR WITH AN ADDITIONAL FEE IS THAT CORRECT. YES MR COUNTERACTED THEN YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THOSE AMENDMENTS I AM SORRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ALL RIGHT. SO REMEMBER THE FORGERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR EIGHTY NINE EITHER ONE WOULD MODERNIZE STATE LAWS GOVERNING THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS TAKEN A TOLL ON THIS INDUSTRY WITH NEARLY TWO THIRDS DECLINE OF REVENUE FOR AIRPORT RENTALS SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT LAW IMPOSES. SOME REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS THAT DO NOT MAKE SENSE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR INSTANCE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE DAMAGE WAIVER PRICE CAP WAS SET AT NINE DOLLARS TO CURB COURSE OF SALES TAX AT THE COUNTER. THIRTY THREE YEARS LATER NEARLY HALF OF DAMAGE WAIVERS ARE PURCHASED ONLINE AND HAD A NINE DOLLAR AMOUNT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION THESE OPTIONAL DAMAGE WAIVERS WOULD COST TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS INSTEAD OF TODAY'S STATUTORY AMOUNT OF ELEVEN DOLLARS. A. B. NINE ZERO ONE IS A BALANCED APPROACH TO GIVE THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY SOME FLEXIBILITY TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC WITHOUT SACRIFICING IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO REMOVE A CONSUMER'S ABILITY TO PURSUE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. SHOULD THIS BILL MAKE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I COMMIT TO AMENDING ANY NINE ONE ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND TO INCLUDE SUGGESTIONS FROM THE CHAIR. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS RONA ALARMING OF ON BEHALF OF ENTERPRISE. AND JOHN ROSS ON BEHALF OF HERTZ. ALREADY MR ROSSI AVAILABLE. I AM HERE ALL RIGHT MR ROSS CLOSURES. GUN RIGHTS IF YOU PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF THE HERTZ CORPORATION I WILL FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT PROPOSES TO LET THE STATUTORY CAP. ON WHAT INSURERS I HAVE MENTIONED THE DAMAGE WAIVERS ORIGINALLY CAP IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AT NINE DOLLARS AN INCREASE A DECADE AGO. TO ELEVEN SEVENTY DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THE PRICE OF THE CAR. FIRST A LOT OF DAMAGE WAIVER IS AN OPTIONAL PRODUCT. IS NOT REQUIRED TO RENT A CAR. RENTAL COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THAT IT IS NOT REQUIRED AND THAT THEIR OWN INSURANCE YOUR CREDIT CARD MAY PROVIDE SIMILAR COVERAGE. CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCT WITH THE OPTIONAL. ROUGHLY 80% OF CONSUMERS DECLINED THE OPTION. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE TWO PARTS OF THE DAMAGE WAIVER ARE MEMBERS OF BUSINESS PROGRAMS ANOTHER LOYALTY PROGRAM. AND CONSUMERS ARE PRICE SENSITIVE. CONSUMERS SELECT THE OPTION IN STATES WITH HIGHER RATES. SECOND THE MANNER IN WHICH MOST PEOPLE REGARDLESS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY BOTH CONSUMERS RENT CARS IN ADVANCE. ONLINE AND THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY REWROTE THE RULES GOVERNING HOW RENTAL CAR RATES ARE QUOTED IN CHARGE. EVERY CONSUMER NOW RECEIVES AN OUT THE DOOR QUOTE. THAT INCLUDES ALL MANDATORY CHARGES AND ANY OPTION SELECTED BY THE CONSUMER INCLUDING THE DAMAGE WAIVER. AMOUNT QUOTED BY PEOPLE THE AMOUNT CHARGED. AND IF WE GET ANY OF THE WRONG CURRENT LAW HAD A SPECIFIC PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION APPLICABLE TO RENTAL CAR TRANSACTIONS. ALLOW CONSUMERS TO STILL. I KNOW THE CAP CURRENT LAW THAT GETS IT AND WHAT CONFLATION AS YOUR FAMILY MEMBER MENTIONED THE NINE DOLLAR CAP ACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WITH PEOPLE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TODAY ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. FIVE CALIFORNIA ONLY NEW YORK AS WELL IMAGE WAVERED POTENTIALLY BELOW MARKET. ILLINOIS RECENTLY REVEALED THEIR CAP. THIS BILL CONTAINS THE THREE ARE FUNDS THAT WHICH WILL ALLOW THE COMMITTEE TO EVALUATE RENTAL COMPANIES BEHAVIOR AND REVISIT THE ISSUE IF NEEDED. ARTICLE SHORTLY EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY AND MODEST RELIEF PROVIDED BY THIS BILL WILL HELP US GET OPERATIONS BACK TO NORMAL IN CALIFORNIA- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOU HAVE. THANK YOU BUT RUN ACT ALARMING. YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS ROCKING LONNIE FROM NEW YORK TO MARK MARK ON BEHALF OF ENTERPRISE HOLDINGS COMPRISED OF ENTERPRISE ALAMO AND NATIONAL BRAND STRONG SUPPORT AT EIGHTY NINE OH ONE WHICH PASSED THE SENATE UNANIMOUSLY WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE FILTER AT THE AT THE RENTAL CAR A LOT OF DAMAGE WAIT FOR CAPPING THE PARTIALLY REMOVED A PROHIBITION AGAINST ADDITIONAL DRIVER FEES BOTH OF WHICH AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ARE OPTIONAL CONSUMER OFFERING WE BELIEVE IT'S HARD TO BELIEVETHEM ALL GIVEN A THREE YEAR FACT THAT ENABLES THE LEGISLATURE TO REVISIT THE CAPPUCCINO. AND THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT CAN NARROW THEIR DISCOGRAPHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BACKSTREET CAP ARE ON AN OPTIONAL PRODUCTS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH TRANSPARENCY OR CONSUMER PROTECTION CONTRARY TO THE OPPONENT'S ARGUMENT THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR CONSUMERS TO KNOW THE TOTAL PRICE OF THE CAR THAT THEY'RE RENTING IN FACT EIGHTY NINE OH ONE PRESERVES ALL OF THE EXISTING MANDATORY DISCLOSURES AND NOTICES THAT INSURABLE TRANSPARENCY IN PRICING AND RELATED CONSUMER DISCLOSURES SHOULD WE VIOLATE THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT MENTION MY DOCTOR WE ARE SUBJECT TO AN EXISTING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE PAGES THREE AND FOUR OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU WORK BACK MANDATES THAT WE MAKE CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE COST OF ANY DAMAGE WAIVER THAT IS IN ADDITION TO THE RENTAL RATE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME OR ALL OF THE RUNNERS LIABILITY TO BE COVERED UNDER THEIR OWN PERSONAL INSURANCE OR THE CREDIT CARD USED TO PAY FOR THE RENTAL AND THE FACT THAT DAMAGE WHATEVER MAYBE DUPLICATE. COVERAGE YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANY OF THESE AFTER CONCERNS THAT CONSUMERS CAN BE MISLED BY ADVERTISEMENTS THAT DO NOT BECAUSE THE FULL RATE FOR AN ADDITIONAL PRIVACY ABOUT THE PROHIBITION IT'S DESIGNED TO LET THE CONSUMER KNOW THE FULL RATE THEIR PAIN WE KNOW THAT SECTION ONE NINETY THREE NINE POINT ONE LINE OF THE CIVIL CODE REFLECTED ON PAGE TEN INCLUDES A BEVY OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AROUND ADVERTISEMENT ALTHOUGH IT WOULD CONTINUE TO APPLY ULTIMATELY AS A RESULT OF EXISTING LOT RENTAL CAR COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO CALL A TOTAL OUT THE DOOR PRICE. WHICH MUST INCLUDE ANY OPTION SELECTED BY THE CONSUMER WHETHER YOU CHARGE. FOR DAMAGE WAIVER BABY FEAT HE RACKED OUR OTHER. SAID I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT THAT MY QUOTED. EIGHTY NINE OH ONE PER. ALL THE PROJECTS IN WINNING THING. ALREADY THANK YOU- ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY WHICH IS BROTHER NOW THEIR AFFILIATES IN THERE BUT SAYING NONE- ROOM ONE SEEING NONE OF ONE TWO. MATER IF YOU CHEW UP- WHICH IS IN SOME OF A BEATEN OH. THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN IT'S ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE WILL START WITH A LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THAT'S ONE THREE FOUR. HELLO CHAIR NUMBER A MILLION MONEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRAVELED TO HOUSTON CALLING AT THE PORT OF EIGHTY NINE ZERO ONE. ZERO THANK YOU. WELL MEXICO LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS ONE TO FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MR KERRY MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IN ORDER LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE IT'S THE ONLY ONES DOING Q. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THERE- NUMBER PROVIDED ONE MOMENT PLEASE. IT APPEARS A FOREVER THEMSELVES FROM THE QUEUE. ALL RIGHTY THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE IN SUPPORT OF. EIGHTY NINE OH ONE. NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME SIR OKAY- LET'S NOT TURN THE OPPOSITION I BELIEVE MR DANIEL GET TEAR THIS IS- AVAILABLE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION. MR GUTERRES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS- DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT LONG FOUGHT FOR CONSUMER RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS WE LOOKED UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED EIGHTY NINE OH ONE BECAUSE IT ELIMINATES THE SPECIAL PROTECTIONS FOR CAR RENTAL CUSTOMERS. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD ELIMINATE EXISTING CAP ON HOW MUCH A CONSUMER COULD BE CHARGED FOR THE VEHICLE DAMAGE WAIVER THE CAPITAL IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO DEFEND RECORD AGAINST COURSE OF BELT TECHNIQUES USED TO SELL THEM TO TERRORISTS WHICH ARE OFTEN DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING COVERAGE FROM A RENTER'S CREDIT CARD. WHAT OPPONENTS HAVE ARGUED AT THE TOP IS NO LONGER NEEDED GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS BOOK RENTAL ONLINE IT IS STILL COMMON PRACTICE FOR CAR RENTAL ASSOCIATE TO BRING UP THE DAMAGE WAIVER AND HAVE TO SELL IT WHEN THE COUPLE ARRIVED TO PICK UP THEIR CAR. LEAVING THEM VULNERABLE TO THESE KINDS OF SALES TACTICS THIS CHANGE WOULD ALSO SUBJECT ALL CORPORATE BUYER RATINGS AT THE COMPANY'S DISCRETION REGARDLESS WHETHER THE BOOK ONLINE OR NOT THE CONSUMER FEDERATION HAS SUGGESTED SOME MIDDLE GROUND AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD INCREASE THE CAP BY 50% AND I GOT A LOAN THROUGH INFLATION GOING INTO THE FUTURE. AND WE BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE FAIR AND WOULD PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM EVER HIGHER RATE FOR THE DAMAGE WAIVER. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE INTERNET EXPANDING THE AUTHORIZED- CORRECT HE PROBATION OF A CHARGING AN AUTHORIZED DRIVER FOR THE RENTER'S CHILDREN- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT EXPANDED A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS- BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK. THE OFFICE FOR THAT THAT THAT WAS TAKEN. ONE LAST. DURING THE CONSUMER CREDIT HAD WITH IT JUST THE CHARGE OF TWICE THE AUTHOR DRIVERS BE ON OFF DRIVERS WHICH WE BELIEVE IT KIND OF IGNORES THE COMPLEXITIES OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE RECORD MAY FACE HOW WHY SHOULD SOMEONE BE CHARGED EXTRA FOR HAVING A FRIEND TRIED THE BOTTLE IN A RENTAL CAR DURING AN EMERGENCY- THE CONSUMER FEDERATION ELIEVE THAT THIS SPEECH SHOULD BE CHANGED SO THAT IT IS THE SAME. AS THE AUTHORIZED DRIVER THE- THANK YOU DON'T. THANK YOU MR GOOD TEARS ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION- HERE IN THE GALLERY SEEING NONE ROOM ONE TWELVE SEEING ONE MODERATOR PLEASE QUEUE UP THOSE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO AB NINE OH ONE NAME AFFILIATION POSITION. IF YOU WISH TO QUEUE UP IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY NINE OH ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MR SURE NO ONE IS COMING UP IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. ALREADY THANK YOU- WELL ALL I SEE SENATOR SENATOR ASOS MICROPHONES RACE AND- THEY'RE ALSO. THANK YOU MR CHAIR BUT QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR- COUPLE QUESTIONS ARE ONE IS. WHY THE SUNSET CHANGE OF SUNSET IT'S THREE YEARS WHY NOT DO A SHORTER TIME AND THEN ALL WHITE COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE CAP THERE HAS BEEN- OBVIOUSLY SOME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THAT AND- THERE'S A GOOD ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN ALLOWED TO. KEEP UP WITH THAT THE COST OF OVERTIME BUT IT SEEMS TO BE GOING TO THE OTHER EXTREME WHICH IS COMPLETELY ELIMINATING THE CAP AND- I KNOW. YOU KNOW I READ A LOT OF CARS ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC I DIDN'T FLY- AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER GETTING AN ORAL. EXPLANATION AS TO YOU KNOW THIS- COLLISION DAMAGE WAIVER AND THE USE OF IT SO I HAVE SOME CONCERNS- I'M READY I'D BE WILLING TO SUPPORT BUT IF YOU COULD ANSWER THOSE TWO QUESTIONS APPRECIATED SIR SIMILAR CALL RON DO YOU CARE TO RESPOND OUR NEW CLOTHES. I'M ALWAYS FINE NOW I ACTUALLY THINK THE SENATOR TORONTO FOR THOSE QUESTIONS AND I'M GOING TO DEFER TO YOU MIGHT WITNESS A EITHER JOHN ROSS OR RUN BACK. MR ROSS ARE YOU AVAILABLE. FOR YEAH I'M- ON THE FIRST TRIP THE TIME THE DEFENSE THAT YOU KNOW SHORTER THAN THREE YEARS- WOULD MEAN WE'D HAVE TO COME BACK IN A YEAR WITH VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE AND PASS THE BILL THE FIRST YEAR OF THE LEGISLATIVE. SESSION THE IDEA WAS TO PUT IT INTO EFFECT JANUARY ONE- UP NEXT YEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE A YEAR OR SO OF EXPERIENCE THE BILL COULD BE INTERVIEWED ON THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND AND WE HAVE THE- PROTECTION TO. DEBATE THE FRONT THAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE. A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND THEN A REPORTER AT THE TIME TO. PASS THE BILL- THAT ONE YOU KNOW ADD TO- THE DISCLOSURES THAT ARE REQUIRED- THERE'S AN ORAL DISCLOSURE REQUIRED IF YOU'RE AT THE COUNTER IF YOU'RE BOOKING ONLINE OR BOOKING- TO A PROGRAM OR YOUR EMPLOYER. TYPICALLY DOES DISCLOSURES ARE MADE IN ADVANCE AND IN WRITING I'M NOT TECHNICAL CHANGES THOSE DISCLOSURES- THERE ON PAGE THREE FOUR AND FIVE OF THE BILL. AND AGAIN IF WE- NOT BAD OUT LEGAL TERM OF ART- THERE. IS THE ABILITY TO DO THE COMPANY DIRECTLY. OUR FROM SORT OF DRUG DOES RESP YOUR QUESTION ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU IN ELSE A YES AND A COUPLE. YES MISTER CHAIR- IT COULD YOU US WHAT IT WHAT THE RANGE OF THE FEES THAT ARE CHARGED GENERALLY FOR THESE PARTICULAR- THINGS THAT YOU'RE ASKING TO BE SUSPENDED- I I'M I UNDERSTAND THERE'S PROBABLY A RANGE AND- SET IT SO THAT WE CAN KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT ON THE BILL IT'S INTENTIONAL. FOR CAR RENTAL. YES YES YOU CAN RESPOND OPEN HAPPENS TO ROSS INTEREST ROSSER MISSED THE ALARMING. YEAH SURE THE INDUSTRY COMMISSIONED A STUDY THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE HERE AND THEN THE ASSEMBLY A LOOK AT THAT AND PROVIDE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS THE CENTER CALERO I THINK WHAT THE STUDY FOUND IS IN THOSE STATES WITH NO CAPS THE PRICES RANGE BETWEEN TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS GIVE OR TAKE- AS I MENTIONED IN MY STATEMENT ONLY- NEW YORK YOU KNOW STILL HAS A CAPITAL MARKET THE PRICES ARE DEPRESSED THERE BUT- YOU KNOW IN ILLINOIS WHICH RECENTLY REMOVED THE CAP I THINK THAT. THE RICES LANDED. SOMEWHERE IN THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR RANGE. AND THEY'RE BOTH IN HEY'RE TWO SEPARATE FEES RIGHT. QUESTION DO YOU MISTER ROSS. ARE YOU THERE IS A THERE IS A FEE THAT IS REGULATED FOR- BAD DAMAGE WAIVER AND THERE IS A TEAR TO BE UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR COMPACT CARS AND MID SIZED CARS- BEGAN YEAH THE BILL PROPOSES TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO SET THOSE- CHARGES. THAT SEPARATELY I GUESS WE CAN DISCUSS THIS WITH THE ADDITIONAL DRIVER- AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN A REGULATED CHARGE IT'S JUST BEEN- A CHARGE THAT WAS LIMITED IN THE INSTANCE THAT THERE COULD BE A POP IN POP UP BOOK BOTH THE CHARGES ARE UP AGAIN FOR OPTIONAL PRODUCTS NO ONE'S REQUIRED. TO BUY EITHER IN ORDER TO GET. A CAR I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT SO IS RIGHT. MORE AND ONE IS NOT SO THE UNREGULATED FEE COULD ACTUALLY BE WHATEVER THE CAR COMPANY WANTS TO CHARGE IS THAT GENERALLY HOW IT GETS SET. CORRECT THANK YOU FOR THE CARRIER SAID WHAT KELSEY DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. I GUESS pDISCUSSION MR CHERRY SAID THE OPPOSITION WHICH IS REPRESENTING THE CONSUMERS IS WILLING TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION AND LET THE FEET GO UP BY FIFTY PERCENT. WITH THE THREE YEAR SUNSET SO PRESUMABLY OF TO THE FEE FOR A COMPACT CARS ELEVEN DOLLARS GOES TO SIXTEEN FIFTY IN A MID SIZE SEVENTEEN DOLLARS GOES TO. TWENTY TWO FIFTY OR TWENTY FIVE FIFTY. THE RENTAL COMPANIES I MEAN THIS IS SAID ADD ON FOR A FEATURE THAT THEY HAVE NOT THEIR THEIR BREAD AND BUTTER IS TO RENT CARS AND WE'VE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT. TICKET OR RENT A CAR TODAY HIS NEXT IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT THE FLEETS OR DELETE DEPLETED I UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY FOR THE- FOR THE FOR THE BILL- I'M JUST. I'M I HAVEN'T BEEN PERSUADED BY THE AUTHOR- HE'S TAKING. THE LIMITED INCREASE VERSUS THE WAIVER WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE RECOVERY OF THE RENTAL CAR BUSINESS SINCE OUR BRAND BETTER IS TO RENT THE CARS AND THEN COME BACK IN. IN THREE YEARS THEY GET THE COST OF LIVING ANYWAY AND COME IN AND ASKED FOR. A FURTHER ADJUSTMENT IF IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO UP TO TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND MAKE THE CASE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A- THIS IS A GOOD. GOOD CONSUMER- OF PROTECTION BUT ALSO TRYING TO HELP OUT THE PEOPLE TODAY- DOING BUSINESS HERE SO. I'M GUTTED. I'M NOT THERE YET ON THE ON THE BILL I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR WHAT CAL SKATE OTHER QUESTIONS CMMENTS SAYING NONE OF CENTER. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND JUST. I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL AS WELL FIVE TODAY BUT JUST A QUESTION THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS ANSWERED AS WELL ON THE- IN THE OPPOSITION THAT- THE RENTAL COMPANIES CAN CHARGE UP TO TWICE THE AUTHORIZED DRIVER FEE IF THEY DISCOVER THAT AN AUTHORIZED DRIVER HAS DRIVEN THE VEHICLE.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND SENATORS AB NINE SEVENTY FOUR REQUIRES MINERS TO WEAR A HELMET WHEN RIDING A HORSE ON PAVED HIGHWAYS AND MANDATES THAT ALL WRITERS OR THEIR EQUINES WEAR REFLECTIVE GEAR- LIGHTS AT SUNDOWN. ANANICH TOBER EVENING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN A VEHICLE STRUCK TWO INDIVIDUALS RIDING THEIR HORSES IN THE COMMUNITY OF LAKE VIEW TERRACE OF LOS ANGELES WHICH IS LOCATED IN MY DISTRICT. THIS CRASH KILLED THE TWO HORSES AND LEFT THE TWO RIDERS IN CRITICAL CONDITION MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY WHICH YOU WILL HEAR FROM SHORTLY BROUGHT THE SAFETY CONCERNS TO MY ATTENTION. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE WE FOUND SIMILAR COLLISIONS IN THE COMMUNITIES OF SAUGUS AND WILL TEND IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S COMMON FOR HORSES TO SHARE THE ROAD WITH VEHICLES HOWEVER IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR DRIVERS TO SEE RIDERS AND THEIR HORSES IN THE DARK. WHEN THESE COLLISIONS OCCUR THE WRITERS YOU ARE USUALLY THROWN OFF THEIR HORSES LEAVING THEM IN CRITICAL CONDITION. THE HORSES USUALLY DIE UPON COLLISION OR MUST BE EUTHANIZED DUE TO THE INJURIES THAT THEY SUSTAINED. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR IS THE DISTRICT GENERATED PROPOSAL THAT FURTHER PROTECTS WRITERS AND THEIR EQUINES THROUGH INCREASED VISIBILITY AND SAFETY MEASURES. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY- THEY ARE LEADERS OF THE EQUESTRIAN COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES I HAVE GENE A CRUISE AND- SURE RE BLOUSE.

IT'S VERY COMMON TO SEE HORSES ON THE STREET IN MY COMMUNITY IN FACT MANY OF THE STREETS IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE DESIGNATED EQUESTRIAN TRAIL WELL WE DON'T HAVE A CONTINUOUS BATTLE CAP ON THE STREET THE SEPARATE RIDERS FROM TRAFFIC SO WE SHARE THE ROAD THE CARD ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AS A FAMILY MEMBER READ AS MENTIONED THERE WAS A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT HERE ON A BUSY STREET INVOLVING A QUESTION THAT A VEHICLE. A COUPLE WAS RIDING ALONG FOOTHILL BOULEVARD AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE STRUCK FROM BEHIND THE RIGHT OF RETURN FROM THEIR HORSES THAT WERE TO BE REALLY INJURED REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION BOTH HORSES CATTLE WERE KILLED IF THE WRITERS HAVE BEEN WEARING REFLECTIVE GEAR IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE TRIBAL ACCENT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME SUCH AN INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED HERE AND IT LIKELY WON'T BE THE LAST CHANGES ARE MADE. WHEN MY DAUGHTER AND I WRITE AT NIGHT ALWAYS WEAR REFLECTIVE VESTS AND PUT REFLECTIVE GEAR ON THE HORSES IT'S JUST THE SMART THING TO DO NOT ONLY FOR SAFETY OF THE WRITERS AND THE FORCES BUT ALSO FOR DRIVERS SO THAT THEY CAN SEE IF ONE WERE ON THE BOAT ROAD AND AVOID A COLLISION WE ALSO ALWAYS WEAR HELMETS WHEN WE RIDE HORSES ARE FLIGHT ANIMALS IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO POTENTIALLY IF THE COURT. AND IF TE WRITER FROM BOB THERE CAN BE SERIOUS RISK OF HEAD INJURY PARTICULARLY ONE FALLING ONTO PEDRO'S.

MANY MANY REFLECTIVE GEAR PACKAGES BUT THERE WAS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE WRITERS ACTUALLY HAVE TO WEAR THEM. AND SO THEY THEY DON'T HAVE HORSE ACCIDENTS CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. MANY OF THE LOCAL WRITERS IN OUR AREA COME HOME FROM WORK PACK UP THEIR HORSE THAT HAD FOR THE TRAILS FOR TO WORK THEIR FORCES OUT. THEY STAY OUT AS LATE AS THEY CAN ON A WARM SUMMER EVENING IN THAT HEAD HOME AFTER THE SUN HAS COME DOWN. IF THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN COMING UP AGAINST A- DARK HORSE.

SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR DOES WELCOME THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN FOUR SIX WHICH WILL CODIFY THE ELIMINATION OF A MINIMUM MARRIAGE REQUIREMENT INTO LAW THAT APPLIES TO ALL COUPLES SEED A STEPPARENT ADOPTION. AND ENSURE THAT PARENTAGE LAWS REFLECT AND FURTHER PROTECT ALL FAMILIES IN OUR STATE ADDITIONALLY IT WILL ELIMINATE INCOME AND EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO PARENTAGE HISTORICALLY SAME SEX COUPLES ARE MET WITH MORE OBSTACLES TO BECOME ADOPTED PARENTS. THAN THEIR HETEROSEXUAL COUNTERPARTS ADOPTION HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY FOR MANY DECADES THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BANNED FROM ADOPTING CHILDREN EITHER DUE TO LEGAL BARRIERS DISCRIMINATION OR MULTI LAYER PROCESS MANY GO THROUGH TO HAVE CHILDREN. OUR CURRENT LAWS ALLOW MANY FAMILIES TO ENCOUNTER EXPLICIT- COVERED DISCRIMINATION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO FILE FOR ADOPTION THIS PROCESS SHOULD NOT BE CHALLENGING BUT RATHER SEAMLESS. CALIFORNIA PROVIDES MANY PROTECTIONS FOR NON BIOLOGICAL PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BUT MANY STATES DO NOT. THIS IS WHY EXPEDIENCY IN THE PROCESS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL OUR LAWS DO NOT PROHIBIT COURTS FROM USING THEIR DISCRETION TO ADD A MINIMUM MARRIAGE REQUIREMENT COUNTY WIDE- BEFORE COUPLES CAN SEE COULD STEP PARENT ADOPTION AS WELL AS AN EDUCATION AND INCOME REQUIREMENTS. THIS MISALIGNMENT OF EXPLICIT PROHIBITION HAS LED TO CONFUSION AND AMBIGUITY IN PRACTICE FAMILIES GOING THROUGH THE STEPPARENT ADOPTION PROCESS ALREADY ENCOUNTER A VERY CONFUSING AND COMPLEX SYSTEM WHAT STATE AND COUNTY POLICIES THAT VERY ACROSS THE STATE. WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE REMOVE THESE BARRIERS AND HINDER THOUGHT DO- HINDER AND THE ADOPTION PROCESS. FOR ALL FAMILIES ESPECIALLY LGBTQ PLUS FAMILIES AND COUPLES WHO EXPERIENCE PERVASIVE OBSTACLES WITHIN THE PROCESS WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS MY WIFE COURTNEY SAID ABOUT THIS DOWNS AND GABRIEL MALDONADO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I TRUE EVOLUTION. ALREADY THANK YOU WELCOME MISS AROUND HIS DOWNS IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO TESTIFY. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER MY NAME IS COURTNEY FOR CONTENT DOWNS AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT EIGHTY SEVEN FORTY SIX. OF THEM BUT I GOT A CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING OUR EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD TRIPLETS I KNOW FIRST HAND THE CHALLENGES THAT PARENTS FACE WHEN GOING THROUGH THE ADOPTION PROCESS. MY WIFE AND I WERE EAGER TO EXPAND OUR FAMILY AFTER MARRIAGE OUR TOPIC HERE HAD LUCKILY TOOK US ALMOST TWO YEARS FROM START TO BOTH OF OUR CHILDREN BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR ALL FAMILIES.DURING MY ADOPTION PROCESS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY I TOOK AT LEAST FIVE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE FAMILY LAW DIVISION AND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME FIRST. FIRST QUESTION. FOR YOU AND YOUR WIFE LEGALLY MARRIED AT LEAST ONE YEAR PRIOR TO THE CHILDREN FOR. BECAUSE IF YOU WERE NOT YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO ADOPT I WOULD ALSO QUESTION ABOUT MY LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND INCOME WELL I DIDN'T MIND PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION. IN MY OPINION THAT IS ANOTHER LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION ONE LEVEL EDUCATION OR INCOME SHOULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD LEGALLY BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PARENTS. ANY OF YOU ARE PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS YOU UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT YOUR CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS IN SAFE HANDS AND SECURE. CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING TO ADOPT YOUR OWN CHILDREN. WELL THAT'S A REALITY IN LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY SO WHY MAKE ADDITIONAL LEGAL BARRIERS TO RESTRICT THAT BUT BEING RECOGNIZED FOR SOMETHING WE HAVE TO TRY SO HARD TO GET INTO THE GAME WITH. OUR PREGNANCY WAS NOT UNPLANNED OR UNINTENDED WE'RE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT OCCURRING IN OUR FAMILY. IN CALIFORNIA ARE FAMILY FULLY PROTECTED AND I RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S EQUAL PARTS MY WIFE BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES. THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO CONFIRM MY PARENTS LIVED THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM. BY TOPPING EIGHTY SEVEN FORTY SIX AND ELIMINATE THE LEGAL BARRIER TO ADOPT A CHILD IT PROVIDES A CLEAR DUE TO THE COURT. AT LAST WEEK THE SAME SEX COUPLES WANTING TO EXPAND THEIR FAMILY AND IT DOESN'T PUT A TIME STAMP ON ONE OF THE ONLY TO FIGHT LIKE CHILDREN. I RESPECTFULLY OPRY COULD PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES AND MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE LIVING IN FEAR BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO LEGAL PARENTS. PLEASE EQUALLY PROTECT ALL OF OUR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN BY CONTINUING TO REDUCE BARRIERS AND ADOPT THEM. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH STARTING AT SEVEN.

DO WE HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER- CHILD PRESENT THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT WELCOME IS A MEMBER CHOKING PLEASE PRESENT D. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MISS SENATORS AT FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX WOULD BRING HEALTH INFORMATION COLLECTED BY DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS TO BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL PRIVACY LAW THE C. M. I. A. DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE GIVING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEW WAYS TO GET USEFUL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE A DIGITAL AND MOBILE CONNECTED INHALER CAN DETECT WHEN THE DEVICES USED TO MEASURE THE STRENGTH OF THE USERS IN ELEVATION AND TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION TO THE USERS DR. ALSO SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL PILLS ARE ALREADY IN USE THESE PILLS CAN RECORD THE TIME AND QUANTITY OF DRUGS TAKEN ONCE TEMPERATURE ACTIVITY LEVEL AND HEART RATE. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION CAN BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND WOULD UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BE PROTECTED UNDER THE C. M. I. A. AND HIPAA. HOWEVER IN ORDER FOR THIS KIND OF DATA TO BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION IT NORMALLY NEEDS TO BE GENERATED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. INFORMATION COLLECTED AT THE PATIENT LEVEL AND OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL FACILITY WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE CAPTURE UNDER MEDICAL PRIVACY LAWS AT FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX WILL BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT UNDER C. M. I. A. BY CONSIDERING ANY BUSINESS THAT OFFERS SUCH AN APP. OR DEVICE TO A CONSUMER TO BE A PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE WITH RESPECT TO THAT APPLE DEVICE THIS WILL ENSURE THAT SENSITIVE. HEALTH DATA IS TREATED WITH THE SAME CARE AS STATED THAT IS GENERATED IN THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SETTING AND PROHIBIT THAT INFORMATION FROM BEING SHARED. WITHOUT THE PATIENT'S WRITTEN CONSENT. WELL TODAY I HAVE A MARINA MAHER ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS- READY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THAT WE GOT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ADULTS. THANK YOU SAM A MEMBER- NOW MOVING ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED WE HAVE A MARINE MAHONEY ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT- SHE AVAILABLE. YEAH HOLY TERROR NUMBERS OF THE- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MARIE MAHONEY I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT A B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX BECAUSE IT WOULD EXTEND EXISTING STRONG HEALTH PRIVACY LAW THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT THE CENTER OF HEALTH INFORMATION GENERATED BY NEW FORMS. OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY. STRONG PROTECTIONS OVER THIS INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR EXAMPLE CONSUMER REPORTS TESTING. THIS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH APPS SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WITH TECH COMPANIES THE TRACTOR BEHAVIOR ACROSS OTHER APPS. THAT INFORMATION COULDBE COMBINED WITH OTHER DATA USED TO TARGET ADS TO YOU. BASED ON INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR HEALTH STATUS DOWN THE ROAD IT COULD BE OBTAINED BY OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND USED TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT YOU. CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THAT DATA MIGHT BE SHARED OR MISUSED. IN CALIFORNIA PATIENT PRIVACY IS PROTECTED BY THE CIA AND HIPAA HOWEVER THESE TWO ARE THE ONLY PROTECT SENSITIVE HEALTH INFORMATION IS GENERATED BY CERTAIN. ENTITIES THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT WOULD APPLY TO. THE DATA THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY BUT THE LAW IS NOT AS STRONG. FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY PA ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO STOP THE SELL THEIR INFORMATION BUT SEE MY HEY BY THE FALL PROHIBITS MOST CASES SHOWING AT ALL. THINKING THEY WERE PROCESSING IT FROM THE CONSUMERS OFTEN EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY OPTING OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR INFORMATION UNDER THE CCPA. SENSITIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION SHOULDN'T BE GOVERNED BY WEAKER SET OF LAWS JUST BECAUSE IT'S COLLECTED BY AN ONLINE SERVICE. OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGY. MAYBE FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX WHAT ADDRESS HERE'S GAPS IN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OVER CONSUMERS SENSE OF HEALTH DATA WE URGE. YOU TO ADVANCE A STYLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

NO ONE ELSE ON THE PHONE SUPPORT OPPOSITION RETURN HERE TO THE FLOOR- QUESTIONS SENATOR RUSSELL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR YES- I'M TRYING TO NARROW DOWN HERE WHEN I THINK OF ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME- THAT THERE IS A CODE ISSUE OF USING INFORMATION WITHOUT THE USERS CONSENT- BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO. DRAWING THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT'S CONSIDERED CONSUMER INFORMATION AND PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION- I TOTALLY AGREE THAT SHARING WITHOUT THE USERS CONSENT IS A REALLY BIG PROBLEM AND WE'VE COME ACROSS THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN- NOT HAVING THE USER'S PERMISSION. ON THE OTHER ISSUE OF DRAWING THE LINE IT IT SEEMS TO ME AND THIS IS WHERE I'D APPRECIATE SOME GUIDANCE FROM THE AUTHOR IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW A FIT BIT- OR CERTAIN MONITORS THAT WE MIGHT WEAR. AND THE- MUCH MORE- EXTENSIVE INSTRUCTOR MEDICAL PRIVACY LAWS LIKE MY MEDICAL RECORD WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM UP FITBIT SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES AT HAND IS THERE ANY WAY TO AMEND TO ADDRESS THOSE ARE THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE I DO THINK IT MIGHT BE EXTENDING THAT SO MUCH TO. CONSIDER ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS AS UNDER THE OF MORE STRICTER C. M. I. A. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SENATOR FOR YOUR QUESTION- WITH RESPECT TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LET'S SAY CONSUMER INFORMATION VERSUS MEDICAL INFORMATION. I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO KIND A TO TRY TO ADDRESS IN THIS BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT MEDICAL INFORMATION IS PROTECTED. ALL WHETHER IT IS BEING GENERATED AND A DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR COLLECTED BY WAY OF A DEVICE OR APPLICATION. NOW CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROVIDES THAT BUSINESSES ATTACKED OUR MANUFACTURER PRODUCED ALL SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE THAT COLLECTS MEDICAL INFORMATION TO BE SUBJECT OF UNDER CLIA SO IN OTHER WORDS LET'S SEE A DOCTOR- HOUSE AN APPLICATION THAT WOULD. COLLECT INFORMATION PATIENT INFORMATION HEART RATES OR OTHERWISE THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION THAT IS UNDER CLIA. ON THE OTHER HAND IF SOMEBODY USES- AN APPLICATION FOR SUBMISSION FITBIT SO IF SOMEBODY USES THE FITBIT TO START RECORDING INFORMATION SUCH AS HEART RATE OR PULSE RATE OR OTHER VERY SIMILAR- INFORMATION FOR EATING REGULAR SLEEPING RATE OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. THAT INFORMATION IS NOT COVERED UNDER CLIA BECAUSE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS BEING COLLECTED OUTSIDE OF THE CONFINES OF THE MEDICAL OFFICE OR NOT BEING IN POSSESSION OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SET OF INFORMATION BOTH HEART RATE. HEART RATE AND SLEEPING PATTERNS OF BREATHING RATE IN BOTH SCENARIOS BUT IN ONE SCENARIO IT IS COVERED UNDER CMI ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS NOT COVER IF THE INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED BY THE DEVICE OR THE APPLICATION. SO WE TRY TO CLOSE THAT GAP. SO DOT IS THE IS THE- YOU KNOW THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT SO IT WOULD TALK ABOUT THE SAME INFORMATION THE SAME HEALTH INFORMATION. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT HEART RATE BREATHING RATE STRESS LEVEL SLEEPING PATTERNS BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL AND ALL THAT INFORMATION IS A SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION. IT IS GENERATED LET'S SAY IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE. SO WE TRY TO CLOSE THAT GAP. FOR THE MAKE SURE THERE IS CONSISTENCY ARE YOU KNOW FOR INFORMATION THA'S BEING GENERATED NOW. LET ME JUST ALSO ADD THAT. I WE TARGETING TWO PARTICULAR SCENARIOS NUMBER ONE ODD SCENARIO WITH A SITUATION WHERE THE INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED BY THAT'S A DIVISIVE FITBIT. AND THEN TRANSMITTED TO ANOTHER PERSON FOR USE LET'S SEE A DOCTOR. NOW THAT INFORMATION IS NOT COVER UNDER CLIA. NOW THE OTHER SCENARIO IS THAT LET'S SAY IF A COP AND- APPLICATION COLLECTS A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM YOU ME AND EVERYBODY. ELSE AND THREE. AGGREGATE DOT DATA FOR EXAMPLE CREATE A DATABASE THAT CONTAINS EVERYBODY'S. INFORMATION LIKE HEART RATE OR BREATHING RATE AND THAT INFORMATION CAN BE SOLD. TO SOMEBODY ELSE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. AND THAT'S THE SECOND SCENARIO THAT WE WANT TO DRESS AND THAT'S HAPPENING ALL ALREADY LET ME SEE IF I COULD SHARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WITH YOU. ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY. OUR THE SURVEY LIKE THIRTY SIX TOP RANK APPLICATION FOR DEPRESSION AND SMOKING CESSATION. PROGRAMS OF THE THIRTY SIX TWENTY NINE OF THEM TRANSMITTED TO DATA TO SERVICES PROVIDED BY FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE. WITHOUT US KNOWING IT SO THEY ALREADY AGGREGATED THE DATA AND THEN DECIDED TO KIND OF SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH SOMEBODY ELSE WITHOUT US KNOWING T. THE OTHER SITUATION IS OUT. THERE WAS AN INSURER. DOT ACTUALLY OBTAINED THREE MILLION PEOPLES INFORMATION MEDICAL INFORMATION FROM AN AGGREGATOR. SUIT SO THIS IS HAPPENING YOU KNOW ALREADY SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW- IN THE FUTURE SO THIS IS HAPPENING THE DATA IS BEING SHARED WITH OTHER PEOPLE WITHOUT US KNOWING IT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED BY A DEVICE BY FIFTY. FOUR BY AN APPLICATION. SO THAT'S THE THAT'S IF I. MAY MISTER CHAIR JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. IS I FEEL. MUCH STRONGER AND IT'S MUCH CLEARER- WHEN A COMPANY IS SHARING MY INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S MY PERSONAL I MEAN WHETHER IT'S ON. MY INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION OR N THE AGGREGATE WITH OTHERS IN A CERTAIN AREA WHATEVER- SHARING THAT WITHOUT OUR CONSENT AND PERMISSION I FEEL. VERY UNCLEAR AND STRONGLY ABOUT- THE OTHER ONE IS IT'S REALLY HARD TO. DISTINGUISH AND- PUT CONSUMER INFORMATION. INTO THE PRIVATE MEDICAL ALL INFORMATION AND I'M NOT SURE HOW TO RESOLVE THAT. BUT IT THEY JUST SEEMS LIKE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DECEPTIVE BABY I'M HUNG UP ON THE OLD FASHION. YOU KNOW OLD SCHOOL WAY YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR ANYTHING THAT'S CONNECTED TO YOUR DOCTOR. IT JUST SEEMS THAT'S VERY PRIVATE- NEEDS. THE MOST- THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF PRIVACY. THE OTHER SEEMS TO BE MUCH MORE- NEBULOUS AND GREAT BIG AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD CONSIDER THAT- MY PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION IF I COULD FOLLOW UP- RESEARCHER ON THAT POINT- I THINK YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD OPS OBSERVATION ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS GROWING SO RAPIDLY AND WE COULD START MEASURING A COLLECTING DATA ABOUT. SOMEBODY'S HEALTH. VERY READILY AND EASILY SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET IN A FREE APP ON THE WEBSITE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT AND SEE WHICH STARTS COLLECTING INFORMATION. WITHOUT YOU KNOW OKAY GETTING US OUT- YOU KNOW IT IS A CONCERN. ABOUT CONSENT SUSAN DOT DOT IS THAT THE REASON YOU KNOW IT'S TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE LAW IS THAT IS SO- TECHNOLOGIES. RAPIDLY GROWING AND WE TRY TO MOVE THE LAWYER THAT TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP TO SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN. THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT. ALL RIGHT THE ROSSES OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SAYING NO OTHER MICROPHONES- THEIR MOTION. SIR WHAT COUNTS THE MOST THE BILL. ALL RIGHT SO YOUR CHARITY CARE CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO YOU DISABLES.

N. I. C. APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION ALSO. ALL RIGHT SEVEN MEMBER CHIP THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS I'M HERE TO PRESENT A B. TWO FORTY FIVE TRANSGENDERED AND BINARY STUDENTS FACE MANY BARRIERS AT SCHOOL AND IN THE WORKPLACE IF A STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE AN UPDATED DIPLOMA OR TRANSCRIPT THEY CAN FACE CHALLENGES APPLYING FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL OR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. A COLLEGE DIPLOMA IS A REPRESENTATION OF YEARS OF HARD WORK AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT WE ALL KNOW IT SHOULDN'T CAUSE STRESS OR EMOTIONAL HARM BY HAVING SOMEONE'S DEAD NAME ON IT. THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS IT ALLOWS TRANS AND NON BINARY STUDENTS AT PUBLIC COLLEGES. TO HAVE THEIR CHOSEN NAME PRINTED ON THEIR DIPLOMA WHEN THEY GRADUATE. AND SECONDLY IT CREATES A STANDARD PROCESS FOR UPDATING STUDENT RECORDS OF FORMER STUDENTS. SAID THAT NAMES AND GENDERS ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED ON THESE IMPORTANT RECORDS. THIS BUILDS ON A LAW THAT WE PASSED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO MAKE SURE THAT FORMER. K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO UPDATE THEIR STUDENT RECORDS ACCORDINGLY. WE'VE HEARD FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO FACE SIMILAR CHARGES AND SO I NEED TO EXTEND THIS POLICY. TO PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESS. TAMMY MARTIN FROM A QUALITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. TAMMY MARTIN AVAILABLE. I BODIE CALIFORNIA I WOULD BE HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR OF EIGHTY TWO FORTY FIVE WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT STUDENTS AND GRADUATES WHO PUT SO MUCH EFFORT AND HARD WORK INTO THEIR SCHOOL CAREER I WILL HAVE THEIR RECORDS REFLECT THAT HARD WORK AS WELL AS THEIR AUTHENTIC SELVES AND OTHER PEOPLE I EXPECT TAKE THE PRIVILEGE FOR GRANTED BUT FOR TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY GRADUATE AN INACCURATE ACADEMIC RECORD OFTEN TRANSLATE INTO DISCRIMINATION AND HARM WHEN THEY FOR EXAMPLE PRESENT TRANSCRIPTION THE JOB APPLICATION PROCESS. WHICH COMPOUNDS THE SOCIETAL BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THAT LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE ALREADY FACE FOR EXAMPLE EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR TRANSGENDER CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN DENIED A JOB THAT THEY APPLIED FOR OR BEEN FIRED OR DENIED PROMOTION BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION AND A THIRD OF TRANS PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING. IN CALIFORNIA ARE LIVING IN POVERTY OR HAVE EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS SO THERE IS A REAL AND PRACTICAL OLD ACADEMIC RECORDS PLAY IN ALLEVIATING SOME OF THESE DISPARITIES ESPECIALLY IN EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING FOR ME THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GEO FOR HELPING TO ENSURE THAT ACADEMIC RECORDS ARE ACCURATE AND AFFIRMING AS WELL AS SAFEGUARD THE PRIVACY AND DIGNITY OF ALL GRADUATE WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS MARTIN OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT IN THE GALLERY ANYONE IN THE GALLERY IN SUPPORT OF A.

MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD QUEUE UP. THOSE IF ANY IN OPPOSITION TO AB. TWO FOUR FIVE. AND THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWO FOUR FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR OPPOSITION. AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- QUESTIONS BRING BACK THE CHAMBER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CENTER MORICHES. AMERICA HAS A VERY LIBERAL HISTORY WHEN IT COMES TO- NAME CHANGES OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD- THE NAME THAT YOU WERE GIVEN AT BIRTH IS THE NAME THAT YOU HAVE IN PERPETUITY. WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGAL NAME CHANGE SO AMERICA I THINK IS HAS A VERY UNIQUE- TRADITION WITH ALL THE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ALLOWS SOMEONE TO CHANGE THEIR NAME. MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATION FOR DOING IT IS- WHY WOULDN'T YOU. WISH FOR PLEASE POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION- TO. MAKE THESE ACCOMMODATIONS AFTER A LEGAL NAME CHANGE. IF I COULD POSE THAT AND THEN FOLLOW UP THERE AFTER THE STRUCTURE HI SALOON OR CHIP SO- SO FIRST OF ALL ON THE ONE HAND I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT- THAT THE NAMES ARE CHANGED AROUND THE WORLD ON A FREQUENT BASIS AND THAT IS ENTIRELY TRUE. PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DRESS WITH THIS BILL IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COLLEGES THAT HAVE MADE MAKING RECORDS ACCESSIBLE IN REVISING THEM DIFFICULT NOT ALL BUT SOME AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT MUCH MORE PREDICTABLE MUCH EASIER- TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHY DON'T WE ASK FOLKS TO GET A LEGAL CHANGE- IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE EXPENSIVE SO IT COSTS- USUALLY OVER FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS TO GET A NAME CHANGE BORDER- AND IT TAKES TIME TO USE THAT LEGAL PROCESS AND- YOU KNOW FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE I THINK. REQUIRING A STUDENT TO PAY THAT ADDITIONAL MONEY JUST TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE COLLEGE THAT THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AS A PERSON THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE- IS A BIT TO ASK- AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE IT SIMPLE- AND- AND DO WHAT WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO WITH REGARDS TO K. TWELVE- TRANSCRIPTS AND DIPLOMAS. THE CARD AND I'M TRYING TO. I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT I'M HAVING. I'M HAVING TROUBLE FIGURING OUT HOW MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT FURTHER ON WHAT PROTECTIONS WOULD BE IN PLACE- TO AVOID FRAUD BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE IT SEEMS AS IF YOU HAVE THIS TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY. TO- TO HAVE NAMES MOVE WITH MESSAGE FREQUENCY POTENTIALLY THAT THERE COULD BE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR MISREPRESENTATION OR FRAUD CAN YOU. GO INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT OF UNIVERSITIES HAVE PROCEDURES TO FOR SOMEONE TO GO AND SAY WHO THEY ARE SO- TYPICALLY THEY WOULD REQUIRE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THEY WOULD REQUIRE INFORMATION ABOUT AN ADDRESS INFORMATION THAT TYPICALLY ONLY THE GRADUATE WITH NO- AND SO THAT'S ASKED BEFORE YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR NAME FROM NAME EIGHT TO NINETY. PARTS OF I'M AN EMPLOYER. AND SO AND SO IS APPLYING FOR THE JOB AND I'M DOING A BACKGROUND CHECK. IN THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS- HAS HAS MODIFIED THEIR- IDENTIFIERS- WHAT IS IT THE CHECK AND BALANCE THAT WOULD OCCUR WHEN THE NAME ON THE DIPLOMA. OR THE RESUME CORRESPONDING TO THE DIPLOMA IS DIFFERENT FROM THE INITIAL SCHOOL RECORD OR WOULD IT CHANGE THE INITIAL SCHOOL RECORD AS WELL. WELLA PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS AREN'T OUTED IN THE WORKPLACE SO IDEALLY THE EMPLOYER DOESN'T KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD A NAME CHANGE THE REAL ISSUE IS- WHAT IS THE NAME ON THE DIPLOMA OR THE NAME OF THE TRANSCRIPT THAT REFLECTS. THE PERSON'S NAME TODAY AND SO THE ISSUE AROUND FRAUD IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT- THAT THAT THAT GRADUATE THAT STUDENT. IS ABLE TO- PREFER THEY ARE TO THE UNIVERSITY THAT THEY ARE THE STUDENT- THAT HAD A DIFFERENT NAME SOME YEARS BACK- THAT NAME GETS CHANGED THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE DIPLOMA. REFLECTS THAT INNOCENT TO THE EMPLOYER SO THAT'S NOT TYPICALLY AN ISSUE THAT- THAT THAT AN EMPLOYER WOULD. WOULD HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. OKAY ONCE AGAIN I THINK- I THINK THERE ARE MECHANISMS IN PLACE I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD WANT IF THEY HAVE CHOSEN AN ANSWER RIGHT TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN ANY FASHION THEY SEE FIT BUT FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT- I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS FEDERAL BIT MORE SECURE AND MY LAST IS WHAT IS THIS PERTAINING ONLY TO. PUBLIC POST SECONDARY. AND YES THIS AUTO WRITER THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES HAVE YOU SEIZE THE CS USING COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IN THE PIVATE IS NOT. UNDER THIS UMBRELLA THAT IS CORRECT CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT THAT'S THE CASE- DID. THAT IS THAT IS HOW WE DRAFTED IT- WE WEREN'T. WE AREN'T IMPOSING THIS ON PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS WERE ASKING THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO- TO STEP UP AS WE DID WITH PUBLICATION TWELVE SCHOOLS. ARE ALL IN WITH THIS I HAD MY MIDDLE NAME IS ALEXANDER AND- I ASKED FOR MY DIPLOMA. JUST WITH MY FIRST AND LAST NAME NOW WITH MY MIDDLE NAME. AND NOBODY WOULD DO IT. THEY INSISTED ON MAKING CERTAIN THAT- THE DIPLOMA WAS AS IT WAS SOME INSTITUTIONS WILL ALSO ONLY ISSUE YOU ONE DIPLOMA. AND ANYTHING THERE AFTER LET'S SAY YOUR DAMAGES. ANYTHING AFTER THAT THERE'S A BIG DISCLOSURE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DEPLOYMENT THIS IS A REPRODUCTION OF THE ONE THAT WAS ISSUED- YOU GOT THE RESOLVE THAT NOW BUT YOU MAY WANT TO BRING UP. OUR LOOK INTO- WHETHER THESE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE THOSE TYPES OF POLICIES ARE IN THE ISSUANCE OF THE REASSURANCE OF DIPLOMAS THANK YOU AND I THINK WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IN RESPONSE TO THAT I THINK THE IDEA THAT. YOU CAN'T GET A DIPLOMA WITH THE NAME THAT. THAT IS YOUR LEGAL NAME THAT YOU WOULD WANT THAT TO ME TRUCKS ARE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND I AGREE THAT THAT THAT THAT POINT. IT IS RIGHT AND THAT'S EXACTLY YOU KNOW I WOULD SUGGEST THAT FOR VERTICALLY FOR TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY. CONSTITUENTS THIS IS- AT A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE- THAT WE OUGHT TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE UNIVERSITIES- THAT WILL PRESENT THOSE TYPE OF PLAYERS- COULD BE. INCREDIBLY HARMFUL WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT THAT. THESE INDIVIDUALS MAY FACE IN THE WORKPLACE FROM PLAN TO GRADUATE SCHOOL SO IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH MORE ACUTE FOR US TO ADDRESS THIS. THANK YOU. PARTY THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT- IS THERE A MOTION. YES SENATOR DOLE'S MOVES THE BILL- ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO. IF US UNDER BOARD HAS BROUGHT HIS DIPLOMA WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO STRIKE ALEXANDER FROM HIS DIPLOMA IF HE PRESENTED IT TO YOU I ABSOLUTELY WOULD I ALSO THINK THAT IF HE HAPPENS TO SPILL SOME COFFEE ON THE DIPLOMA. HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ANOTHER DIPLOMA THAT- REFLECTS IN PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO STANDARDIZE THE FACT THAT. SOME UNIVERSITIES DO A GOOD JOB OF ALLOWING. RECORDS ACCESSIBLE ALLOWING RECORDS TO BE REVIVED WITH APPROPRIATE- GUARDS AGAINST FRAUD AND I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE FRAUD IS OCCURRED. IN THIS AREA- BUT THERE ARE OTHER UNIVERSITIES AT HOW THEY WERE TRYING TO JUST AGAIN PRADA ALL PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO- TO MAKE THIS ACCESSIBLE TO ENSURE. REAL FAIRNESS AND ACCESS FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE SPENT YEARS GETTING THOSE DIPLOMAS AND FROM HOME. NOT THAT INFORMATION IS SO IMPORTANT AS THEY'RE MOVING INTO DIFFERENT STAGES OF THEIR LIVES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIMILAR TO WE WON'T REQUIRE AS AN AMENDMENT THE ACTUALLY STRIKE HIS NAME.

LAST ISSUES WE DID FACILITATE A CALL BETWEEN CLASS C. L. AND A AND D. O. J.

ALL RIGHT SIR HERBERT. THEY CAN I JUST PICKED UP I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL BUT I ALSO AND I HOLD THIS AUTHOR IN EXTREMELY HIGH REGARD. SHE JUST REALLY DOES HER HOMEWORK IMAGES IS FABULOUS SAID. ADDITION TO THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY- I JUST THINK THAT FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER I DIDN'T EXAMINE IT I JUST HAD ONE MEETING WITH SOME FOLKS. FROM THAT GROUP AND IT SOUNDED LIKE. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DIMENSION TO THIS AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE THOSE BIG GROUPS TOGETHER AND WHAT IT TAKES. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A NOT FOR PROFIT AND SHE GETS A PLATFORM FOR. INFORMATION THAT GRANT MAKERS AND OTHERS CAN GO TO BOMB ABOUT ABOUT GETTING INFORMATION THEY DON'T RAISE THE MONEY THEY DON'T DO ANY OF THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT I COULD BE WRONG. BUT I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW HE'S ON A JOINT AND AS YOU DO THE HOMEWORK WHICH ALLOW IT WAS DO OR MOVE THE BILL BUT I ALSO WANT TO JUST A JOINED IN WITH. A SENATOR RAWSON CENTER JONES THAT REGARD JUST BE MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO FIX IT BECAUSE IF I LOOK AT THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE LEGITIMATE BUT IF THEY'RE A GOOD ORGANIZATION. THAT ISN'T REALLY INTENDED TO FALL WITHIN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE MODERNIZE FUNDRAISING BUT IS SIMPLY A PLATFORM. THAT FOLKS CAN GO TO FOR A REFERENCE POINT EIGHTY TWO IS A NOT FOR PROFIT IT MAY BE WORTH CONSIDERING THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG ANY OTHER CAR YES SIR JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE RECOGNITION I CERTAINLY SHARE SINNERS BURGERS OPINION OF THE AUTHOR- WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT CONVERSATIONS AND ACTUALLY I'VE LEARNED QUITE A BIT.

WE POINTED OUT BECAUSE- IT'S ALREADY LAW THE BOARD DEPOSIT HOMEOWNER MONEY IN FEDERALLY INSURED ACCOUNTS HOWEVER. BOARDS ARE ALREADY TAKING MONEY OUT OF INSURED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND HANDED OVER TO BROKER DEALERS TO INVEST IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND THEY'RE DOING THIS WITHOUT PENALTY OF ANY KIND.

A CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND- ITEMS UP FOR NEW YEAR'S TIME THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ALSO KNOWN AS A. R. C. MUG SHOT POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS JUST ANOTHER INSTANCE OF HOW SOCIETY DEMONIZES CHAINS AND OSTRACIZED AS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE YET TO BE FOUND GUILTY OF ANY CRIME. I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE DAMAGES THAT MAY OCCUR WHEN SOMEONE'S MUG SHOT IT POSTED ONLINE OF COURSE THERE ARE THE DAMAGES TO THE EXCUSE MY OWN FACE WAS CHARACTERIZED AS A MURDER BUT I WASN'T IN A SENSE AND THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THE MANY CONSEQUENCES OF MY CHOICES.

OKAY I AM REALLY GOOD AT IT I. THAT WOULD BE DEFAMATORY BUT I THINK THIS PRIVILEGE IN ANY EVENT THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THIS MEASURE WOULD YOU AND YOUR STAFF- THIS IS RELATED TO AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY HISTORY UNFORTUNATELY. A SAD PIECE AS FAR AS THE RACIAL INJUSTICE ON ON OUR HOUSING POLICY- RELATED TO- HOUSING COVENANTS SET FOR EXCLUDED INDIVIDUALS- MINORITIES- YOU KNOW OTHER. ASIANS AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS IN JEWISH INDIVIDUALS- FROM PURCHASING HOMES IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS AS THIS HAS A CHANCE TO RIGHT A WRONG AND I WENT THINK UNIQUELY STAFF WORKING WITH US- AND START OFF BY SAYING WE WILL- ACCEPT THE SUGGESTIONS AND PAGE SEVEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND CHARTING A PATH FORWARD AND- PENDING TODAY'S POSSIBLE PASSAGE OF THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE TAKEN NEXT COMMITTEE. TO ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE TO IDENTIFY REDACT RACIST COVENANTS ON A LARGER SCALE AND REMOVE- REMOVE THIS GREAT EASIER PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO REMOVE THEM ON THEIR OWN- WE KNOW THAT THESE COVENANTS WERE PRIVATE AGREEMENTS BARRING NON WHITES FROM OCCUPYING OR OWNING HOMES AND PROPERTY AND KEY ELEMENTS. OF A SEGREGATIONIST POLICIES IN THE EARLY PART OF THE LAST CENTURY- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA RIGHT HERE IN THIS MY OWN DISTRICT RIGHT HERE IN. IN SOUTH LAND PARK IN FRANKLIN TOP PARK WHEN I BOUGHT MY FIRST HOME I REMEMBER MY REALTOR SAYING HEY KEVIN I KNOW THAT YOU ARE BI RACIAL AND- YOUR DAD'S AFRICAN AMERICAN- YOU KEY AND YOUR AND YOUR SPOUSE'S ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW YOU GUYS GOING TO BE A BIRACIAL. MULTICULTURAL FAMILY LIVING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD I JUST IGNORED PAGE FIFTY SEVEN IT TALKS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN'T LIVE IN THIS HOUSE AND LITERALLY I OPENED THE PAGE TO PAGE FIFTY SEVEN AND I WAS FLOORED- SHOWING THAT YOU KNOW WHO COULD LIVE THERE WHO COULD NOT LIVE THERE THOSE OF COURSE WERE DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE SUPREME COURT NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT. BUT THE THEY THEY REMAIN AND SOME WOULD SAY. WELL THERE ARE A RELEVANT JUST LET THEM BE. WELL WE DON'T BE- OVER WATER. OF SAY WHITES ONLY WE TAKE THEM DOWN BECAUSE THEY ARE. UGLY REMINDERS OF OUR PAST SO THIS WILL ALLOW US TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS. AND REMOVE THESE RACIAL COVENANTS FROM OUR DEEDS. THIS WE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE- OUR LOCAL REALTORS IN A LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION- RECORDERS TO COME UP WITH THIS ELEGANT SOLUTION. THAT WILL REMOVE OPPOSITION AND WITH THAT IT WAS THE LAST BILL TODAY I ASK THE ARRIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY LET ME JUST MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME SHEET MUSIC I THINK YOU STATED IT BUT BUT- I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THE STAFF ANALYSIS OF THE BILL INCLUDES AN OUTLINE OF THE DIRECTION YOU PLAN TO TAKE. WITH THE BILL THAT PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE IN VERY BROAD TERMS THAT SCHIFF WOULD CONVERT THE BILL FROM A PASSIVE TRANSACTION BY TRANSACTION APPROACH FOR REDACTED DISCRIMINATORY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS TO A PROACTIVE APPROACH. TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY TASK FORCE DEDICATED TO THAT PURPOSE DOES THAT ACCURATELY CHARACTERIZE WHERE THIS BILL IS HEADED CORRECT MISTER CHAIR ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- NONE IN THE GALLERY OF PRINTS WILL WITNESS AND SUPPORT SOMEONE MEMBER CARTY SEVEN BILLION TO ON THE PHONE JAMIE LEWIS HELLO I'M SORRY MY YES JAMIE LEWIS- MR LEWIS.

IN TERMS OF THE DISCRIMINATORY LEGACY THAT CONTINUES TO REVERBERATE IN OUR COMMUNITY- IN THE DE FACTO SEGREGATION IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD THAT REALLY. EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT LEGALLY. I IT. WE CAN'T DISCRIMINATE LEGALLY THESE- PRACTICES PRACTICES BUILD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR COMMUNITY AND REALLY SPECIFICALLY IN OUR HIGHER- NEIGHBORHOOD NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY- AND REALLY LIMITING OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS- FOR A BLACK BROWN AND INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORS AND SO THIS LEGISLATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I AM I AM REALLY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF IT TODAY I HAVING YOU KNOW WORK IN THIS. FIELD FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE CAN'T IGNORE THE STATE SANCTIONS ARE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN OUR HOUSING POLICY THAT CONTINUE TO LIMIT OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO BE IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX AND I'M HONORED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS MOSS. BY JAMIE LEWIS OR JOANNE KARCH MAR ARE YOU AVAILABLE. EMAIL ALL RIGHT. OKAY I'M SO THANK YOU CHAIR AND BURGER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX MY NAME IS JAMIE LEWIS I'M A RESIDENT AT ST LOUIS OBISPO I NEED INTO WHAT'S CALLED THE N. HOME DISTRICT IN FAMILY FOR THIS LOW IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHILE I WAS PURCHASING MY HOME I WAS FILLING OUT A STACK OF PAPERWORK AND MY REALTOR SHARED WITH ME AND MY FUTURE HOME COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS. BUT AS READING THROUGH THESE I WAS APPALLED TO FIND A PROVISION PROHIBITING ANYONE OTHER NON CAUCASIAN RACE FROM OCCUPYING OR OWNING THE HOME I KNEW I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS P. C. AND R. BUT I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO DO THEN IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER I HAD A MOMENT OF RECKONING WHERE IT BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE RACIST LANGUAGE IN MY C. AND R. AND THE MURDER OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AT THE HANDS OF THE POLICE. ARE ALL A PART OF AMERICAN MULTI FACETED RACIST PAST AND PRESENT THIS IS WHEN I BEGAN THE PROCESS OF HAVING THAT LANGUAGE REMAINS I STARTED SPEAKING TO NEIGHBORS I'M GUESSING THAT THE COVENANTS WERE PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT THE N. HOME DISTRICT. DESPITE KNOWING THESE CABINETS ARE NO LONGER LEGAL OR ENFORCEABLE IT'S POSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNSEE SOMETHING SO OUTWARDLY PREJUDICE THE COMPETITION IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS THE DIRECT PRODUCT AT BCC AND OURS WITH FAMILIES WITH BOTH BEING WHITE. FOURTEEN NEIGHBORS AND I WERE ABLE TO GET THE LANGUAGE AND THEN ENGAGING AN UNCOMFORTABLE BUT NECESSARY CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE COMPOUNDING IMPACTS OF THE CCN OURS HOW THEY BARRED BLCK FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING WHAT THE PREHEATED. OVER GENERATIONS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. FOR ME REMOVAL OF THE COVENANTS IS A SMALL STEP IN ADDRESS. THAT THE MY LARGER IN. AT THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. HOWEVER IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ELEVATING THE MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATION AND KNOWLEDGE AND THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND PRIVILEGE. THE PRESENCE OF THE CCN OURS UNDERSCORES HOW MUCH WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE RACIAL EQUITY IN THE UNITED. STATES AND FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX TO HELP CALIFORNIANS LIKE MYSELF. GET THIS LANGUAGE REMAINS AND I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE SINGLE THING WHICH IS. 88% OF PEOPLE LIVING FAMILY BUT SO ARE WHITE. THERE ARE AS THERE ARE. IN THE COUNTY OF SAN LUIS OBISPO.

HAD TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER- RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS- IN THE FRESNO AREA THAT I REPRESENT YOU KNOW IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR THERE TO BE- CONFIDENCE THAT RESTRICTED PROPERTY TRANSFER AGAINST EASY ADDICTS INCLUDING ARMENIANS YOU KNOW SEMITIC AND OTHER GROUPS- AND THOSE THINGS ARE A RELIC OF THE PAST AND IF THERE'S A WAY OF. INVENTORY IN THOSE- ISSUES AND REMOVING THEM IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T IMPEDE TODAY'S TRANSFER OR REFINANCING I THINK IT'S A SMART WAY AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AUTHORS AGREE TO THOSE MOMENTS AND BECAUSE OF THAT ALL BE SUPPORTIVE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO ITS- IT'S FINAL VERSION X.
