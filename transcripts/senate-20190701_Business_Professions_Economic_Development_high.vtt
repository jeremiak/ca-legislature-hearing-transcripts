DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE.

BELIEVES THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:10.055
BOARD IS A POLITICIZED --

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:12.424
INSTITUTION I THINK THAT THEY GO

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.326
AND THEY LOOK AT SORT OF THE

00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:16.094
FOUR CORNERS AS WE SAID IN

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:17.462

DETERMINATION.

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.768

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:24.836
OF THE LAW AND ONE THING THAT

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:26.738

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:27.839
CONCERN OTHERS.

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:30.308
IS THAT YOU'RE GOING -- TO AN

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:33.478
ENTITY. FOR BETTER FOR WORSE

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:37.349
THAT IS A VERY POLITICIZED --

00:23:37.415 --> 00:23:39.785
INSTITUTION AGENCY AND SO I

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.286
THINK WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE

00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:43.155
MAKE SURE THAT NO MATTER WHAT

00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:45.323
THE PROCESS IS THAT IT IS AN

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.391
IMPARTIAL PROCESS.

THE AVAILABLE DATA SHOW THAT

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:48.953

EVEN HELP HER WITH HER RESUME.

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:27.165
IMPORTANT THAT WE STOP THIS TYPE

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:29.700
OF OF THE ACTIONS THAT ARE

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:30.268
TAKING PLACE BY SOME OF THE

STOP IT.

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:35.306
THAT THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:36.274
BECAUSE IF YOU SAY WE'VE GOT

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.143
HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS -- EVEN

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:43.381
OF THE THOUSANDS THAT THAT ARE.

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:43.915
THEN ROLLED IN SOME OF THE

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:44.749
SCHOOLS.

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:45.983
AFTER THIS BILL IS PASSED.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.051
HOW DO WE CUT IT OFF HOW DO WE

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:48.786
FIND THE BAD GUYS SEPARATED FROM

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:49.921
THE GOOD GUYS AND WHAT IS THE

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:52.256
PUNITIVE ACTION THAT WE SHOULD

00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:53.791
TAKE? TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NO

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:55.259
LONGER IN PRACTICE.

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:56.627
WALK ME THROUGH THAT.

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:59.297
YES SO THIS BILL REALLY.

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.998
LOOKS AT THE QUESTION OF AND THE

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.233
REGISTRATION PROCESS AND TAKING

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.368
REGISTRATION A FROM THE SCHOOLS

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:06.037
THAT ARE GETTING THAT -- WE KNOW

00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:07.371
ARE HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC I

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:08.739
UNDERSTAND IN MY CONVERSATIONS

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:10.475
WITH THEM THE CHAIRMAN AND THAT

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:11.642
COMMITTEE STAFF.

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:12.810
THAT IT ISN'T CLEAR THAT THAT

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:15.580
WILL TAKE ALL OF THESE FOLKS OFF

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:17.081
OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE WE

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:17.882
ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:18.516
THAT ARE.

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:19.784
OPERATING WITHOUT THE

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:20.751
REGISTRATION SO I THINK THIS IS

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:21.752
THE FIRST STEP AND I THINK YOUR

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:23.521
POINT IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE

00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:24.922
TO MONITOR THIS AND MAKE SURE

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:26.491
PROTECTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:28.192
AND FARE WARS MORE TEETH THAT WE

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:29.393
FOLLOW UP.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.595
IN AND I WOULD IMAGINE THERE

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:32.196
SHOULD HAVE TO BE SOME

EXCESSIVE THAT.

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.842
I CAN'T BEGIN TO FATHOM HOW THEY

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.279
TUITION INFLATION.

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.647
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I

00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:44.982
SEE THEM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:46.650
LARGE POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:48.252

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:56.427

00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:58.095

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:45.954
MORE MONEY WITHOUT MY

SCHOOL'S BEEN SHUT DOWN IT

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.202

VETERANS LEGAL CONNECTIONS ARE

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.454
FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW.

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.823
THIS IS ONE OF THE BILLS WELL I

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:22.157
SHOULD FOR SAY THAT THE POINT OF

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:24.393
THIS BILL IS TO FACILITATE

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:25.694
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS IMPORTANT.

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:28.163
LAWS -- AND PRINCIPLES OF BY

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:30.799
BRINGING CLARITY TO CURRENT LAW

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:32.601
AND BY BRINGING THE BEST PARTS

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.536
OF FEDERAL LAW DOWN INTO

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.939
CALIFORNIA HOW DOES THIS BILL DO

01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:37.739
THIS.

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:38.540
FIRST IT STRIKES THE DEFINITION

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:39.942
OF EMPLOYEES THAT INDEPENDENT

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:41.677
CONTRACTORS ALSO CAN'T BE

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.545
PROVIDED OR OFFERED KICKBACKS TO

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:46.248
GET -- TO USE THE COLORFUL

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.482
PHRASE REAR IN CINCY.

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:49.785
THAT IS ALREADY FEDERAL LAW ALL

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:50.752
OF THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OPPOSE

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.855
THE BILL TODAY ALREADY HAVE TO

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:54.156
COMPLY WITH THAT.

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.657
IT INCLUDES FINANCIAL AID AS

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.092
AMONG THE THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.027
KICK BACK FOR THAT IS ALREADY

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:00.128
FEDERAL LAW.

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:01.363
ALL THE PEOPLE HERE WHO MIGHT

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:02.998
OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY ALREADY

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.900
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THAT.

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:07.035
IT SAYS THAT THE BILL ADDS

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:09.404
DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY --

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:11.273
DIRECTLY FROM FEDERAL LAW THAT

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.574
TO PREVENT WINK AND NOD

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:15.244
ARRANGEMENTS -- AND IN BED THAT

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:16.511
CALIFORNIA LAW.

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:17.679
THAT IS NOT NOVEL.

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.414
THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM FEDERAL

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.115
LAW.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.383
EVERYONE WHO IS WHO MIGHT OPPOSE

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.552
THIS BILL ALREADY HAS TO COMPLY

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:25.153
WITH THAT BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LAW.

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.321
THE BILL ADDS THE WORD

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.657
CONTINGENT IN THIS IS A CRITICAL

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:30.993
ADDITION TO THE BILL.

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:32.427
AND THAT IS ON SCENE AND EITHER

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:34.096
FEDERAL OR STATE LAW.

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:36.331
AND THE REASON THAT'S IN THERE

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:37.833
IS BECAUSE IT BENEFITS

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.668
INSTITUTIONS BY CLARIFYING

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:42.704
ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:43.472
THIS IS NOT A STRICT LIABILITY

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:44.606
STANDARD.

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.375
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A CONTINGENT

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:49.111
QUID PRO QUO ARRANGEMENT THE

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.746
VIOLATE THIS LAW.

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.247
THAT BENEFITS INDUSTRY BUT IT

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:53.715
BENEFITS STUDENTS TO BY OFFERING

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:55.817
CLARITY AS TO WHAT THE LAW DOES

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:56.385
PROHIBIT AND WHAT IT DOESN'T

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:57.319
PROHIBIT.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.021
AN ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.789
USED THE WORD SUCCESS.

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:02.658
IT IN ORDER TO DEFINE THE KINDS

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:03.959
OF THINGS THAT WERE PROHIBITED.

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.727
WE DELETED THAT BECAUSE SOME OF

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:06.995
THE OPPOSITION OBJECTED TO THAT

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:09.364
IS AMBIGUOUS EVEN THOUGH THAT

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:10.766
COMES FROM FEDERAL LAW.

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:13.869
ON WE DELETE A NEW POLL I'M

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.837
SORRY WE ADDED EXEMPTION -- AT

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.973
THE REQUEST OF AT A UT I WOULD

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.373
BECAUSE SHE DID.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.475
A TERRIFIC I THINK EXEMPTION FOR

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:20.676
THEM.

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:22.177
OUT WHERE BY.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.146

ARRANGEMENTS ACTUALLY GET TO THE

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:28.183
CAP AND GOWN.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.017
THAT HELP PEOPLE GO FROM

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:29.751
ENROLLMENT ALL THE WAY TO

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.119
GRADUATION WE CLARIFY THAT

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:32.854
THAT'S NOT ILLEGAL IN THOSE

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:33.755
INSTANCES THE INTERESTS OF

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:35.457
STUDENTS IN THE INTEREST OF GOOD

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.525
INSTITUTIONS ARE COMPLETELY

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.226
ALIGNED A VERY HELPFUL AMENDMENT.

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:38.961
THAT ISN'T SEEN IN EITHER

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.629
FEDERAL OR STATE LAW CURRENTLY

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.497
AND FINALLY -- AMONG THE MORE

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:44.766
AND PERHAPS.

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.601
MORE DOMINANT OF THE DISCUSSION

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.403
IS WE ADD THE WORDS CONDITION.

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:49.538

THOSE WORDS ARE NEW.

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.712
BUT IT IS A CLARIFICATION.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.847
OF KINDS OF ARRANGEMENTS THAT

01:16:58.914 --> 01:16:59.648
ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL HOW DO WE

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.116
NOTICE.

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:02.517
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE IT CANNOT

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:03.986
POSSIBLY BE THE CASE.

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:05.654
THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.155
IT IS ILLEGAL TO DOCK SOMEONE'S

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:10.125
PAY. FOR FAILING TO MEET A QUOTA.

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:12.661
BUT ENTIRELY LEGAL TO FIRE THEM

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.231
THE ANSWER IS NO THE BEST

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:52.787
MISTER CHAIRMAN MAP BACK

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:53.455
REPRESENTING CAPS OF CAPS IS THE

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:54.122
LEADING ASSOCIATION FOR

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:56.424
CALIFORNIA REPRESENT A HUNDRED

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:57.159
FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS.

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:57.893
WE'VE BEEN ENGAGE WITH THE

01:19:57.959 --> 01:19:58.827
AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS ON THIS

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:01.029
BILL FOR WELL OVER A MONTH WE'VE

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.697
OFFERED TO SET OF AMENDMENTS --

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:05.033
I THINK I AGREE WITH ALMOST

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.067
EVERYTHING THESE SUPPLEMENTS AT

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.936
WE WE DO NOT ONE INSTITUTIONS

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.638
PROVIDING KICK BACKS TO THEIR

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:11.773
EMPLOYEES. TO INSURE MORE

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.341
STUDENTS EITHER -- IN ROLLING

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:14.776
THE INSTITUTION OR GET MORE

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:16.044
FINANCIALLY.

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.112
AND IN FACT IS A COMMITTEE

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.847
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT CURRENT LAW

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:20.982
AND FEDERAL LAW VERY CLEAR ON

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:23.685
THAT ISSUE -- POTENTIALLY MAYBE

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.187
ONE OF THE ISSUES IS ENFORCEMENT --

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:27.656
WE DO KNOW THE BUREAU -- HAS HAS

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:29.224
KIND OF HISTORY IN A BACKLOG OF

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.559
OF THINGS IN AND MAYBE THEY ARE

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:31.760
NOT DOING IT.

01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:33.862
BUT IRONICALLY THE FEDS AREYOU

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:35.063
MENTION THE ACADEMY OF ART THEY

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.298
PAID A SIGNIFICANT FIND TO THE

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.200
FEDS JUST LAST MONTH TO PUBLIC

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.601
UNIVERSITIES WERE HELD

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.503
ACCOUNTABLE UNDER THE SAME

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:42.204
PROVISION OF LAW.

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:43.772
SO THE FEDS ARE EVEN UNDER THIS

01:20:43.838 --> 01:20:45.307
ADMINISTRATION.

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:47.142
ON ENFORCING THE LAW.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.310
SO WHAT IS THIS BILL DO IN MIND

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:49.711
WE HAVE CONCERNS.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:51.846
IT HAS A LOT OF VAGUE AND NEW

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:54.482
TERMS THAT WILL PRESENT A BUNCH

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:56.484
OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. FOR

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:58.386
INSTANCE THE BILL SAYS ANY

01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:01.756
CONTRACT AND ANY BENEFIT FOR ANY

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:04.192
PERSON INVOLVED IN RECRUITING

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.827
ENROLLMENT CONTINUE IN A MOMENT

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:07.395
ATTENDANCE.

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:09.164
EVERY EMPLOYEE IN OUR SCHOOLS

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:13.802
WILL TOUCH ONE OF THOSE THINGS

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:15.136
AT ANY GIVEN DAY.

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.137
CAN WE NOT PROVIDE FOR A ONE

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:17.405
CASE THAT'S IN ANY BENEFIT CAN

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:18.073
WE NOT PROVIDED PENSION PLAN CAN

01:21:18.139 --> 01:21:19.040
WE NOT PROVIDE A YEAR END BONUS

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:20.742
IF ANY OF THOSE EMPLOYEES WERE

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:23.044
AT ANY POINT INVOLVED.

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:24.713
IN THOSE ACTIVITIES.

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:26.047
NOW ONE OF THE MAIN PROVISIONS

01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:26.781
THAT WERE CONCERNED WITH IS

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.183
SOMETHING CALLED THE CONDITION

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.217
THE EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:30.752
CERTAINLY A NEW TERM FOR THE

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:31.720
SPACE.

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.788
CONDITION THE POINT SO WE HAVE

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:35.323
ENROLLMENT WE HAVE ADMISSIONS

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:36.591
FOLKS THEIR JOB.

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:38.326
IS TO TALK TO STUDENTS AND GET

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:39.628
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN THE

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:40.662
UNIVERSITY OR THE INSTITUTION

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.931
RIGHT THEY CAN'T GET PAID BASED

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:43.498
ON THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THEY

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:44.833
BRING IN.

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:46.201
BUT THEIR JOB IS TO MAKE CALLS

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:47.569
THEIR JOB IS TO FOLLOW UP ON

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:49.838
EMAILS THEIR JOB IS TO PROVIDE

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:51.373
TOURS THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.874
SO IF WE CAN'T CONDITION

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:55.010
EMPLOYMENT BASED ON THOSE

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:57.379
ACTIVITIES WE COULD NEVER

01:21:57.445 --> 01:22:00.048
TERMINATE AN EMPLOYEE FOR NOT

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:02.083
DOING THEIR ROUTINE.

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.151
ACTIVITIES.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:05.153
SO AGAIN THE GENERAL PREMISE OF

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.222
THE BILL WE AGREE WITH.

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:08.390
WORDS MATTER.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:09.991
AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNINTENDED

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:12.027
CONSEQUENCES OF IN THIS BILL WE

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.795
PROVIDED TWO SETS OF AMENDMENTS

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:14.696
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:15.363
COMMITTEE.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:16.831
I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:17.766
COMMITTEES ANALYSIS IS THE FIRST

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:19.334
TIME WE'VE HAD A THOROUGH

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:20.535
DISCUSSION ON THE BILL.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.137
AND A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:23.872
THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS --

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:26.474
SO WHERE WERE OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.909
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:28.643
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:29.978
WITH THE WITH THE OFTEN SPONSORS

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:31.212
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:34.115
ANY OF OUR CONCERNS TODAY.

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:34.649
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE

ATTEMPT BY THE SPONSORS TO

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:49.670

THIS MORNING IN READING THE

DRAFTING OVERSIGHT THAT

APPARENTLY ALL THE ENTITIES.

ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUDED IN

01:42:05.018 --> 01:42:06.253
HERE I THINK I'VE GIVEN MANY OF

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:09.022

ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE OPPOSITION.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.009
ALSO I THINK THAT IN AN OUNCE IS

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:31.245
IT IT DISCUSSES SAW SECTION TWO

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.646
THIRTY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS

01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:34.982
DECENCY ACT -- THIS BILL WILL BE

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:36.350
GOING TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY WHERE

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:37.751
I THINK THE FOCUS MORE ON THAT

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:39.453
BUT ASSUMING JUST FOR SAKE OF

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.787
ARGUMENT THAT.

01:42:40.854 --> 01:42:42.523
IT DID NOT APPLY I THINK THERE'S

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:44.191
SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:45.792
AT THE BUREAU BEFORE.

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:48.095
THE BILL CAN BE MEANINGFULLY --

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:51.064
COMPLIED WITH AND THAT IS.

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:53.467
LICENSE LISTINGS -- NEED TO BE.

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:55.435
ACCURATE AND HAVE INCLUDED DOING

01:42:55.502 --> 01:43:00.707

ONLY LISTEN NAME OF THE LICENSE

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:03.577
HOLDER NOT THE NAME UNDER WHICH

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.078
THE RETAILERS OPERATING SO OFTEN

01:43:05.145 --> 01:43:06.580
TIMES.

01:43:06.647 --> 01:43:07.948
YOU WILL HAVE A LICENSED ENTITY

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:09.383
BUT IT'S OUR IT'S HARD TO FIND

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:11.485
LICENSE NUMBER BECAUSE YOU'LL BE

01:43:11.552 --> 01:43:14.321

YOU KNOW A NAME OF A BUSINESS

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:18.692
BUT THE LICENSE HOLDER IS --

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:21.628
STEPHEN JOHN -- SO THAT NEEDS TO

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:23.564
BE UPDATED WE'RE ALSO SEEING

01:43:23.630 --> 01:43:25.732
DELAYS WISHING TO LACE UP TO

01:43:30.203 --> 01:43:33.440
ACTUALLY ON THE BUREAU'S WEBSITE --

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:35.876
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:37.344
TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT.

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:39.947
ONLY LICENSE ENTITIES ARE

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:41.815

OF ADVERTISEMENTS YOU WON'T FIND

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:50.290
ANY LICENSE NUMBERS -- IT NEEDS

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:51.959
TO BE ACCURATE AND TIMELY.

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:53.727

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:59.499
THE READER FOR SECOND THOUGHT

01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:00.934
NOT HAVING THE ACTUAL LOCATION A

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:02.536
RETAILER INHIBITS OUR ABILITY TO

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.304
CROSS REFERENCE FOR LICENSE

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:04.972
ACCURACY.

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:06.473
SINCE THE PHYSICAL LOCATION

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.674
ADDRESSES WHAT IS USED TO

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:08.976
IDENTIFY THE RETAILER ON

01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:09.977
PLATFORMS.

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:10.877

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:14.014
WORKABILITY ISSUES WITH THE BILL --

PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING WITH

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:18.151
WHICH NEWSPAPER HAS.

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:20.186
VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER WHAT

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:22.856

DIRECTLY CONTROLLED IT'S BOTH --

01:49:58.692 --> 01:49:59.459
BECAUSE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:00.360
UNFAIR TO IMPOSE LIABILITY ON A

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:02.295
PUBLISHER WHO HAS VERY LITTLE

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:04.164
CONTROL OVER.

01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:20.413
PUBLISHERS DON'T.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.415
HAVE THE THE TIME TO GO OUT AND

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:24.351
FACT CHECKED EVERY SINGLE THING

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:26.619
WE RELY ON THE ADVERTISERS TO

01:50:26.686 --> 01:50:29.356
ENSURE THAT THE ADVERTISEMENT IS

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:31.057
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW.

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:33.526
AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S OKAY SO

01:50:33.593 --> 01:50:34.728
SO BASICALLY YOU'RE CONCERNED

01:50:34.794 --> 01:50:36.196
HERE IS IS THAT IF SOMEONE

01:50:36.262 --> 01:50:38.465
FALSIFIES INFORMATION BUT YOU

01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:40.800

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:51.444
AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE OTHER

01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:53.113
TYPES OF ADVERTISING I GUESS

01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:55.315
SOMEONE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE IF

01:50:55.382 --> 01:50:56.249

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:19.072
IF YOU'RE REQUIRING ALL OF THESE

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:20.974
THINGS AND ADD ANOTHER LINE TO

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:22.942
REQUIRE THE BUSINESS LICENSE.

01:51:23.009 --> 01:51:24.711
NOW -- WE WORKED WITH THEM AND

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:26.846
GOT THEM OFF THE OPPOSITION AND

01:51:26.913 --> 01:51:28.648
NOW THEY'RE NEUTRAL -- SOUL WE

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:30.550
FELT THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:32.185
THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:33.553
ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS BY.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.855
AND THEN ONLINE WORLD AND EVEN

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:37.757
IN THAT -- PRINT WORLD WHEN YOU

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:39.359
PRESENT AN ADVERTISEMENT OR

01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:40.827
CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:42.195
ASKED WHAT SIZE AND ALL THAT SO

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:43.463
I THINK IT.

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:44.531
WOULD BE FAIR TO JUST ADD

01:51:44.597 --> 01:51:45.398
ANOTHER LINE SAY WHAT IS THE

01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:47.100
LICENSE NUMBER NOW THE OTHER

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:48.701
ISSUES CAN BE DEALT WITH BY.

01:51:48.768 --> 01:51:50.236
THE FACT THAT THEY SAY THAT IT'S

01:51:50.303 --> 01:51:51.171
UNFAIR.

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:52.839
THAT WERE REQUIRING THEM TO ADD

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:53.807
ONE MORE LINE TO SOMETHING IS

01:51:53.873 --> 01:51:55.308
REALLY NOT AN ARGUMENT IN MY

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:56.810
KIDS BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THIS IS

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:57.977
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:51:58.044 --> 01:51:59.612
THAT ENTITIES LIKE THEM ARE

01:51:59.679 --> 01:52:01.081
WORKING WITH LEGAL FOLKS YOU

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:04.184
KNOW WE DON'T WANT -- TO ALLOW

01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:07.353
THE LEGAL MARKET TO SATURATE AND

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.556
THEM TURN A BLIND EYE EITHER AND

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:10.957
SO I THINK THERE'S IN ORDER TO

01:52:11.024 --> 01:52:12.759
BE BE A RESPONSIBLE ADVERTISER

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:15.261

01:52:19.332 --> 01:52:20.700
BECOMES LAW THEN THAT'S BE JUST

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:21.167
ANOTHER.

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:22.402
OB PORTION THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:24.003
FOLLOW AND IT TO ME IT DOES NOT

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:26.606

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:47.013
DRIVING THROUGH THIS THE THEY

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.248

EVERYTHING THAT THEY WERE

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.154

01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:56.022
EXCITED FOR THEM.

AS A CHIROPRACTOR WE WE ALL WE

02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:06.732

A PATIENT IN FACT I JUST HAD A

02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:11.470

02:00:11.537 --> 02:00:13.372
A FIREMAN THAT AND WORKED UP AND

AGREE THAT OPIOIDS CAUSING DEATH

02:00:32.592 --> 02:00:33.826
WOULD BE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

02:00:33.893 --> 02:00:35.394
INHERENT RISK.

02:00:35.461 --> 02:00:36.796

IF APPROPRIATE.

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:09.275
THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES IN

02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:10.109
WHICH CHIROPRACTIC TREATMENT

WORD REFERRAL IS LARGELY PROBLEM

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:42.007
LARGELY PROBLEMATIC AS A

02:04:42.074 --> 02:04:43.175
REFERRAL IS SOMETHING THAT

02:04:43.242 --> 02:04:44.643
SPECIFIES A PROVIDER.

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.846
AND SIGNIFIES INSURANCE COVERAGE

02:04:46.912 --> 02:04:48.113

RELIANCE ON THE SERVICE BEING

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:55.020
COVERED ONLY FOR THE PATIENT TO

02:04:55.087 --> 02:04:56.055
FIND OUT THAT THEIR INSURANCE

02:04:56.121 --> 02:04:57.656
DOESN'T COVER THE SERVICE AT ALL.

02:04:57.723 --> 02:04:58.891
OR HAS ITS OWN LIMITS ON

02:05:02.294 --> 02:05:03.329
WE WOULD ASK THAT THE WORD

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:05.931

02:08:56.228 --> 02:08:59.064
ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS PRIOR

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:00.065
TO PRESCRIBING THAT THAT -- GOOD

02:09:00.132 --> 02:09:02.067

02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:03.802
INFORMED CONSENT PROVIDES THAT

02:09:03.869 --> 02:09:06.071
TEETH IN A MECHANISM TO OF GET

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.473
THAT ENFORCEMENT THE OTHER THING

02:09:07.539 --> 02:09:09.308
YEAH THE SECOND COMPONENT WAS IT

02:09:09.374 --> 02:09:11.844

DEFINITIVE -- SEGMENT BUT RATHER

02:09:40.405 --> 02:09:42.107
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY THE

02:09:42.174 --> 02:09:42.908
INTENT TO HELP.

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:44.276

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:58.357
OF THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION --

02:09:58.423 --> 02:09:59.391
BUT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:01.260

WELL THIS WAS A NOT ALL PAIN IS

02:10:32.925 --> 02:10:35.160
THE SAME -- ONE CAN EVEN ARGUE

02:10:35.227 --> 02:10:36.962
THAT BECAUSE THIS IS FOCUSED ON

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:39.031
NON PHARMACOLOGICAL -- THERE ARE

02:10:39.097 --> 02:10:41.600
MANY OTHER PHARMACOLOGICAL.

02:10:41.667 --> 02:10:42.901
TREATMENTS FOR PAIN ASIDE FROM

02:10:42.968 --> 02:10:45.237
OPIOIDS AND IN FACT -- MAY

CONVERSATIONS IS THAT -- WE

02:10:47.039 --> 02:10:48.674
SHOULD PERHAPS BE USING THOSE

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:51.810
INSTEAD -- CERTAINLY I THINK

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.178
YELL NON PHARMACOLOGICAL

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:54.780
TREATMENTS ARE HELPFUL BUT

02:10:54.846 --> 02:10:56.748
PROVIDING A I MEAN WHAT AM ZERO

PAIN POST SURGICAL YOU HAVE LOTS

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:10.596
OF DIFFERENT POTENTIAL SOURCES

02:11:10.662 --> 02:11:13.899
OF PAIN AND JUST GIVING EVERYONE

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:14.800
A LIST OF?

02:11:14.866 --> 02:11:15.467
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MAY NOT US

02:11:15.534 --> 02:11:16.435
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE

02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:17.903
PAIN THAT THEY HALF BECAUSE WHEN

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:19.404
WE'RE SEEING A PATIENT WHERE.

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:20.405
THEY'RE NOT SAYING OH I JUST

02:11:20.472 --> 02:11:21.473
HAVE PAIN THEY HAVE A VERY

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:23.175
SPECIFIC FORM OPINION MAY HAVE

02:11:23.242 --> 02:11:24.676
HEADACHE THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE

02:11:24.743 --> 02:11:26.044
THEY MAY HAVE POST SURGICAL PAIN

02:11:26.111 --> 02:11:26.845
ETCETERA.

02:11:26.912 --> 02:11:28.247
AND NOT ALL THESE NECESSARILY

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:29.548
APPLY FOR EXAMPLE PHYSICAL

02:11:29.615 --> 02:11:31.516
THERAPY CAN BE SOMETHING VERY

02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:33.385
GOOD FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN.

02:11:33.452 --> 02:11:34.953
ALRIGHT BUT IF THAT'S NOT MUSCO

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:36.455
SKELETAL WHERE WE BRING IT UP I

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:39.358
MEAN THAT CONFUSES PATIENTS

02:11:39.424 --> 02:11:39.958
PATIENTS ARE LIKE I MEAN THEY

02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:40.892
WHAT.

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:41.693
THAT'S WHY THEY WANT TAILORED

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.562
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THEIR

02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:45.230
STICKLER SITUATION AND I AND

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:46.732
THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT -- I

02:11:46.798 --> 02:11:47.566
FIND THAT PARTICULARLY

02:11:47.633 --> 02:11:49.568
TROUBLESOME BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:50.769
IS NOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:52.437
WE'RE GONNA POSED BY LAW WE TO

02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:53.205
TELL DOCTORS WHAT THEY HAVE TO

02:11:53.272 --> 02:11:54.039
SAY.

02:11:54.106 --> 02:11:56.675
AND THEY HAVE TO BASICALLY GO

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:57.609
OUT AND TELL.

02:11:57.676 --> 02:11:58.977
GIVE PATIENTS OPTIONS THAT THEY

02:11:59.044 --> 02:11:59.811
DON'T FEEL ARE ACTUALLY

02:11:59.878 --> 02:12:01.513
APPROPRIATE FOR THEM GIVEN THE

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:02.948
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:12:03.015 --> 02:12:04.416
AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD THIS

02:12:04.483 --> 02:12:05.817
KIND OF CONVERSATION AROUND

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:07.919
OTHER AREAS AS WELL -- RANGING

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:09.821
FROM YOU KNOW SO NO REPRODUCTIVE

02:12:09.888 --> 02:12:11.123
HEALTH TO OTHER TYPES OF THINGS

02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:12.691
AND I THINK WE JUST GOT TO BE

02:12:12.758 --> 02:12:16.461
VERY CAREFUL ABOUT -- NOT.

02:12:16.528 --> 02:12:18.430
TELLING DOCTORS TO FORCE THEM TO

02:12:18.497 --> 02:12:19.998
SAY THINGS THAT THEY DON'T

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:21.566
BELIEVE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

02:12:21.633 --> 02:12:22.668
PATIENTS.

02:12:22.734 --> 02:12:24.236
AND ARDEN IS AN APPROPRIATE FOR

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:25.737
PATIENTS PATIENTS SO IT'S ONLY

02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:27.306
THERE ARE PARTICULAR ROLES FOR

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:28.807
DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE

02:12:28.874 --> 02:12:30.142
THINGS -- FOR PARTICULAR

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:31.677
SITUATIONS BUT TO HAVE THEM

02:12:31.743 --> 02:12:33.278
REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE

02:12:33.345 --> 02:12:34.513
LIST.

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:35.347
EVEN IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:36.415
THE PAGE I THINK THIS CREATES

02:12:36.481 --> 02:12:38.383
CONFUSION AND AND CAN BE

02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:41.186
MISLEADING FOR PATIENTS AND SO --

02:12:41.253 --> 02:12:42.521
I IT'S EIGHT YEAH I'M VERY

02:12:42.587 --> 02:12:43.922
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT EIGHT AND

02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:45.524
THEN THE NEXT STEP IS REFERRAL

02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:47.292

02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:49.227
ABOUT THAT BUT I JUST WANT.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.768
BECAUSE I THINK AGAIN.

02:12:56.835 --> 02:12:57.336

THAT ARE NECESSARY -- SEEM TO GO

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:05.764
TOO FAR AND I THINK SOME OF THE

02:15:05.831 --> 02:15:07.299
AMENDMENTS REALLY GOING TO BRING

02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:08.834
IT INTO SOMETHING I THINK PEOPLE

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.335
SHOULD BE -- SHOULD KNOW OF

02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:11.603
ALTERNATIVES THEY SHOULD BE

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:13.004
AWARE OF ALTERNATIVES BUT I

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:14.439
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT THE

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:16.241
PLACE FOR THAT DOCTOR. TO TO GO

02:15:16.308 --> 02:15:19.010
THAT FAR WITH REFERRALS WITH THE

02:15:19.077 --> 02:15:21.413
THE CONSENT NECESSARY.

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.248
TO THAT WE WILL MAKE OUR MEDICAL

02:15:23.315 --> 02:15:25.484
CHOICES -- IN THE MANNER IN

02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:27.085
WHICH WE WE DO BECAUSE WE

02:15:27.152 --> 02:15:28.987
BELIEVE IN CERTAIN APPROACHES TO

02:15:29.054 --> 02:15:31.690
THAT -- I THINK CERTAINLY

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:34.025
ALLOWING AND AND EDUCATING THE

02:15:34.092 --> 02:15:36.761
THE PATIENT IS IMPORTANT -- AND

02:15:36.828 --> 02:15:38.263
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE AWARE OF

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:39.498
IT BUT I DON'T I I JUST THINK

02:15:39.564 --> 02:15:43.368
THIS IS MORE OF A OF A BURDEN

02:15:43.435 --> 02:15:44.369
RATHER THAN.

02:15:44.436 --> 02:15:45.737
THE SOLVING OF A PARTICULAR

02:15:45.804 --> 02:15:47.072
PROBLEM THAT THAT MAYBE THAT WE

02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:50.509
ALL BELIEVE IN -- EXIST TODAY SO --

02:15:50.575 --> 02:15:52.544
THAT'S THE CONCERN I HAVE I JUST

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:53.845
THINK IT'S JUST TAKES A LITTLE

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.280
BEYOND WHERE I'M COMFORTABLE

02:15:55.347 --> 02:15:56.915
GOING.

02:15:56.982 --> 02:15:59.518
THANK YOU SENATOR HIM.

02:15:59.584 --> 02:16:01.019
LET ME HEAR.

02:16:01.086 --> 02:16:03.188
JUST ALONG PLEASE -- LET LET ME

02:16:03.255 --> 02:16:04.823
SAY -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW

02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:06.124
AYE AYE APPROVED MUCH APPRECIATE

02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:08.460
YOUR LEADERSHIP -- AND AND YOUR

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:10.629
CONCERN IN THIS AREA OF OPIOIDS

02:16:10.695 --> 02:16:12.163
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.

02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:13.832
AND I THINK THAT -- YOU HAVE

02:16:13.899 --> 02:16:15.467
BEEN INVOLVED IN TRYING TO

02:16:15.534 --> 02:16:17.702
CREATE A MUCH BETTER

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:20.705
CIRCUMSTANCE AWARENESS -- ON

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:21.773
SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS A BIG

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.542
PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT WHAT

02:16:23.608 --> 02:16:24.876
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL.

02:16:24.943 --> 02:16:26.244
IN TERMS OF EXPANDING THE

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:27.779
REQUIREMENTS FOR PRESCRIBERS TO

02:16:27.846 --> 02:16:30.348
DISCUSS THE RISKS AND DANGERS --

02:16:30.415 --> 02:16:31.917
TO ALL PATIENTS WE DID THAT FOR

02:16:31.983 --> 02:16:32.717
MINORS.

02:16:32.784 --> 02:16:34.953
YEAH YOUR EFFORT YOUR GOAL IN

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.187
THIS BILL TO EXTEND THAT TO ALL

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:37.689
PATIENTS IS SOMETHING THAT I

02:16:37.756 --> 02:16:38.823
HEARTILY AGREE WITH.

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:41.159
AND I THINK IT'S IT'S WHAT MAKES

02:16:41.226 --> 02:16:42.661
THAT PART OF THE BILL SUCH AN

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:45.297
IMPORTANT THING I THINK FOR US

02:16:45.363 --> 02:16:47.365
TO ADVANCE THIS YEAR -- I ALSO

02:16:47.432 --> 02:16:51.236
THINK THAT -- IN ENCOURAGING --

02:16:51.303 --> 02:16:53.572
PRESCRIBERS TO TO TALK ABOUT NON

02:16:53.638 --> 02:16:56.007
PHARMACY AT PHARMACOLOGICAL

02:16:56.074 --> 02:16:56.608
ALWAYS HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT

02:16:56.675 --> 02:16:57.442
WERE TREATMENTS.

02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:59.311
IS ALSO A VERY HEALTHY THING TO

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:01.413
DO -- BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:17:01.479 --> 02:17:02.647
DIFFERENT WAYS TO TO DEAL WITH

02:17:02.714 --> 02:17:04.349
PAIN SENATOR HILL WAS TALKING

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:05.884
ABOUT HIS CHIROPRACTOR I ALSO GO

02:17:05.951 --> 02:17:07.352
TO A CHIROPRACTOR.

02:17:07.419 --> 02:17:08.954
AND I FIND THAT TREATMENT TO

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:10.488
HAVE BEEN VERY VERY EFFECTIVE

02:17:10.555 --> 02:17:12.090
FOR ME BUT THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER --

02:17:12.157 --> 02:17:13.558
TREATMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:15.060
THAT THAT THAT MAY BE MORE

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:16.861
APPLICABLE TO THE DISCOMFORT OR

02:17:16.928 --> 02:17:18.163
PAIN THAT THAT PERSON IS

02:17:18.229 --> 02:17:19.464
EXPERIENCING.

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:21.032
AND SO I ALSO FIND THAT PART OF

02:17:21.099 --> 02:17:23.969
YOUR BILL TO BE VERY POSITIVE

02:17:24.035 --> 02:17:24.970
AND VERY ENCOURAGING.

02:17:25.036 --> 02:17:26.538
WHERE I DIFFER I THINK FROM THE

02:17:26.605 --> 02:17:27.872
DIRECTION THE BILL?

02:17:27.939 --> 02:17:30.375
IS A IS IN THESE AREAS A LOT OF

02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:32.611
INFORMED CONSENTS NOT SOMETHING

02:17:32.677 --> 02:17:35.981
WE'VE EVER REQUIRED -- FOR A

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:38.183
PRESCRIPTION THAT I'M AWARE OF

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:39.884
AND I ALSO THINK THAT BEING SO

02:17:39.951 --> 02:17:42.387
SPECIFIC ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVES.

02:17:42.454 --> 02:17:43.555
I THINK GOES FARTHER THAN I

02:17:43.622 --> 02:17:44.956
THINK -- THAT WE SHOULD BECAUSE

02:17:45.023 --> 02:17:45.857
I THINK WE SHOULD BE RELYING

02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:47.359
UPON THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR

02:17:47.425 --> 02:17:48.259
POSITIONS.

02:17:48.326 --> 02:17:49.361
THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING THE

02:17:49.427 --> 02:17:51.262
TREATMENT TO TO BE THOUGHTFUL

02:17:51.329 --> 02:17:52.931
ABOUT HOW AND WHAT THEY THEY

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:54.399
TALK ABOUT THAT.

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:55.467
AND I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT BEAT

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:57.435
BY BEING MORE SPECIFIC I THINK

02:17:57.502 --> 02:17:59.971
IT TAKES AWAY FROM -- AT A

02:18:00.038 --> 02:18:00.839
TAKING DVANTAGE OF THE

02:18:00.905 --> 02:18:02.440
PROFESSIONALISM THAT WE EXPECT

02:18:02.507 --> 02:18:03.441
FROM THOSE.

02:18:03.508 --> 02:18:04.609
FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THAT

02:18:04.676 --> 02:18:06.044
EXAMINATION.

02:18:06.111 --> 02:18:07.846
SO HERE YOU HAVE A CASE OF THE

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:10.115
YOUR BILL -- ADVANCING SO VERY

02:18:10.181 --> 02:18:12.317
MERITORIOUS ALIMENTS THAT I

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:13.785
WOULD LIKE TO SEE ENACTED.

02:18:13.852 --> 02:18:15.253
BUT I THINK IT DOES GO A LITTLE

02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:17.956
FURTHER THAN I THINK IT IT

02:18:18.023 --> 02:18:19.224
SHOULD IN THESE OTHER AREAS.

02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:20.358
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERN ON THE

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:22.227
ISSUE OF REFERRALS.

02:18:22.293 --> 02:18:24.362
HOWEVER -- MY THOUGHT THERE WAS

02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:26.498
THAT -- IF THIS BILL DOES MOVE

02:18:26.564 --> 02:18:27.899
FOR THE THIRD BE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:29.567
IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- TO TO

02:18:29.634 --> 02:18:30.902
KIND OF TALK ABOUT THAT ISSUE

02:18:30.969 --> 02:18:32.270
AND TRY TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND.

02:18:32.337 --> 02:18:33.605
BETTER COMMON GROUND BUT

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:35.240
UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT PREPARED

02:18:35.306 --> 02:18:36.341
TO MOVE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT

02:18:36.408 --> 02:18:38.176
FORM WITHOUT THOSE TWO SUGGESTED

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:39.044
A MAN SO.

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:40.311
WHEN TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU AND

02:18:40.378 --> 02:18:41.279
GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:43.515
ANY ANY CLOSING COMMENTS YOU

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:44.582
WANT TO MAKE?

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:45.150
YES SEVEN I THINK WE'VE HAD

02:18:45.216 --> 02:18:46.918
CONVERSATIONS ALREADY WITH

02:18:46.985 --> 02:18:48.053
RESPECT TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES

02:18:48.119 --> 02:18:48.787
I THINK YOU OUTLINED IT QUITE

02:18:48.853 --> 02:18:50.655
WELL THAT FUNDAMENTAL

02:18:50.722 --> 02:18:52.757
DISAGREEMENT -- AS AS I

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:55.794
PRESENTED THIS BILL WITH RESPECT

02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:57.128
TO THE VARIOUS.

02:18:57.195 --> 02:18:58.730
OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE BUT

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:01.266
NOT LIMITED TO SO WHEN WE'RE

02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:02.467
HAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:19:02.534 --> 02:19:03.501
NARROWING.

02:19:03.568 --> 02:19:05.303
IT'S NOT LIMITED TO SOME OF

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:05.804
THESE.

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:07.272
KIND OF TYPE OF TREATMENTS I

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:08.907
THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY THE INTENT

02:19:08.973 --> 02:19:09.441
OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:12.544
BECAUSE WE WANT TO TACKLE THIS

02:19:12.610 --> 02:19:14.045
IN A VERY COURAGEOUS FASHION AND

02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:15.680

02:19:15.747 --> 02:19:16.314
BEFORE.

02:19:16.381 --> 02:19:17.649
BECAUSE STATUS QUO IS NOT

02:19:17.716 --> 02:19:19.517
WORKING AND SO I SHARE THAT

02:19:19.584 --> 02:19:21.086

THESE VARIOUS ISSUES BUT I JUST

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:33.465
THINK.

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:35.300
WE NEED SOME TEETH TO THIS AND

02:19:35.366 --> 02:19:36.034

DIFFERENT MODALITIES TO CONTINUE

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:50.795
IS A DATABASE THAT'S IN THE DOJ

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:51.963
SO IT'S NOT NOT HEALTHCARE

02:27:52.029 --> 02:27:54.732
ENTITY SO IT'S AS I THINK WE

02:27:54.799 --> 02:27:56.567
NEED TO CLARIFY THE THE THE

02:27:56.634 --> 02:27:58.336
NATURE OF OUR OUR YOU KNOW BUT

02:27:58.402 --> 02:27:59.904
OUR STATE FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS

02:27:59.971 --> 02:28:02.940
HOW TO PLACE TO THIS AND I ALSO

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:04.875
REMIND -- IN A DO YOU KNOW THIS

02:28:04.942 --> 02:28:05.476
BUT JUSTREMIND YOU FOR

02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:07.144
LISTENING TO THIS IS IS THAT --

02:28:07.211 --> 02:28:08.346
OFTENTIMES WE TALK ABOUT

02:28:08.412 --> 02:28:10.748
PICTURES AND AND CONTROLS OF

02:28:10.815 --> 02:28:11.749
THIS IS ABOUT THE X. OPIOIDS BUT

02:28:11.816 --> 02:28:13.351
THERE ARE A LOT OF MEDICATIONS

02:28:13.417 --> 02:28:15.419
ARE NOT OPIOIDS.

02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:17.255
THAT ARE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.

02:28:17.321 --> 02:28:17.722
ALL RIGHT.

02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:21.926
AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW I

02:28:21.993 --> 02:28:25.529
I DON'T THINK YOU LIKE KIDS WITH

02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:26.264
ADHD.

02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:27.932
THOSE -- STIMULANTS ARE.

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:28.566
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES REASON A

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:29.133
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE BECAUSE

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:29.634
THEY DO HAVE SOME OF AN

02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:30.835
ADDICTION POTENTIAL RIGHT AND SO

02:28:30.901 --> 02:28:32.270
THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE.

02:28:32.336 --> 02:28:33.938
OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT ARE --

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:36.574
ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT SCHEDULE --

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:37.508
FIVE THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS TO

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:39.510
HAVE CODEINE -- THAT'S THE MAIN

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:40.711
SUBSTANCE THAT'S IN THERE BUT

02:28:40.778 --> 02:28:41.846
ACTUALLY THERE ARE OTHER

02:28:41.912 --> 02:28:44.215
MEDICATIONS THEIR SCHEDULE FIVE

02:28:44.282 --> 02:28:45.483
HAD OR NOT THERE ARE NONE OF

02:28:45.549 --> 02:28:47.218
MORE -- TOO LATE OKAY -- SO

02:28:47.285 --> 02:28:50.621
THOSE ARE IN THERE AND CERTAINLY

02:28:50.688 --> 02:28:53.858

UNDERSTANDABLY A LOT OF SUPPORT

02:28:57.461 --> 02:28:59.363
IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT I I

02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:01.766
I I THINK THAT -- WE REALLY DO

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:02.933
AND I'M LIKE I ASKED YEAH I'M

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.068
NOT SUGGESTING ANY FURTHER

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:05.169
MINUTES FROM THE COMMITTEE AND

02:29:05.236 --> 02:29:06.570
SO FORTH I THINK WE DO NEED TO

02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:08.472
KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS HEALTH

02:29:08.539 --> 02:29:10.808
INFORMATION AND YOU CAN FIND OUT

02:29:10.875 --> 02:29:11.809

MEDICATION Và LOT OF OTHER

02:29:12.943 --> 02:29:13.110
THINGS.

02:29:13.177 --> 02:29:14.712
ABOUT PEOPLE VERY SENSITIVE

02:29:14.779 --> 02:29:16.047
THINGS I THINKSOME OF THE

02:29:16.113 --> 02:29:19.150
STEROIDS -- ARE SO THE PEOPLE

02:29:19.216 --> 02:29:21.419
ARE -- ARE ARE ALSO CONTROLLED

02:29:21.485 --> 02:29:24.889
SUBSTANCES TO SELL -- AND THEN

02:29:24.955 --> 02:29:26.157
WE STARTING ABOUT -- S WE START

02:29:26.223 --> 02:29:27.258
THE OUT WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION

02:29:27.325 --> 02:29:29.226
CAN CAN BE REVEALED AND AND AND

02:29:29.293 --> 02:29:31.595
SO FORTH SO -- I APPRECIATE THE

02:29:31.662 --> 02:29:32.830
THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTING

02:29:32.897 --> 02:29:33.998
AMENDMENTS THAT REALLY THE

02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:35.232
SHOULD IT JUST FIRST OF ALL

02:29:35.299 --> 02:29:36.200
SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR

02:29:36.267 --> 02:29:37.702
ENFORCEMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE A

02:29:37.768 --> 02:29:38.969

THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN ALSO

02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:46.944
IT -- I THINK AS THE MATCH BY

02:29:47.011 --> 02:29:48.746
ACLU WE NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE

02:29:48.813 --> 02:29:50.114
SOME GOOD BOUNDARIES AROUND.

02:29:50.181 --> 02:29:51.649
AROUND THIS AGAIN WILE STILL

02:29:51.716 --> 02:29:53.517
HAVING SERVICE FUNCTION TO BE

IT AS AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE --

02:30:05.463 --> 02:30:07.298
BUT I HOPE WE KEEP IN MIND AS WE

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:08.966
THINK MORE ABOUT ACTORS DATABASE

02:30:09.033 --> 02:30:10.901
BILLS ABOUT THESE PRIVACY ISSUES

02:30:10.968 --> 02:30:11.969
AND REALLY THINK ABOUT -- WE'LL

02:30:12.036 --> 02:30:14.205
WHAT KIND OF PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

02:30:14.271 --> 02:30:15.940
WERE PUTTING AROUND REALLY AT

02:30:16.006 --> 02:30:17.675

AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU.

02:30:23.714 --> 02:30:26.117
THE CENTER PAN SENATOR GALGIANI --

02:30:26.183 --> 02:30:27.318
SO I SEE HERE ON PAGE SIX OF THE

02:30:27.385 --> 02:30:28.352
ANALYSIS THAT THE SCHEDULE FIVE

02:30:28.419 --> 02:30:32.323
DRUGS ARE GENERALLY USE FOR ANTI

02:30:32.390 --> 02:30:36.026
ANALGESIC PURPOSES.

02:30:36.093 --> 02:30:38.229
AND I TYRONE REALLY.

02:30:38.295 --> 02:30:39.797
IS IS THAT A MISTAKE OR IS THAT

02:30:39.864 --> 02:30:40.931
WOULD.

02:30:40.998 --> 02:30:42.600
THAT WOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN BE ON

02:30:42.666 --> 02:30:46.036
SCHEDULE.

02:30:46.103 --> 02:30:48.005
FIVE CAN SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS MORE

02:30:48.072 --> 02:30:49.940
ABOUT THAT I I SEE IT OVER THE

02:30:50.007 --> 02:30:52.109
THAT.

02:30:52.176 --> 02:30:53.310
GOOD TO ME SORRY.

02:30:53.377 --> 02:30:54.745
LET ME ASK OUR COMMITTEE

02:30:54.812 --> 02:30:56.147
CANCELED OUT TO ADDRESS YOUR

02:30:56.213 --> 02:30:57.415
QUESTION THERE ARE SOME DRUGS

02:30:57.481 --> 02:30:58.315
AND THAT.

02:30:58.382 --> 02:30:59.383
THAT WOULD TREAT THOSE

02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:01.018
CONDITIONS THAT OUR SCHEDULE

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:03.988
FIVE THAT WOULD BE REPORTED IN

02:31:04.054 --> 02:31:04.889
THE CARE SYSTEM UNDER THE SPELL.

02:31:04.955 --> 02:31:07.558
AND THAT'S PRESCRIPTION OR IS

02:31:07.625 --> 02:31:08.826
THAT THE OVER THE COUNTER THAT.

02:31:08.893 --> 02:31:10.561
THESE ARE PRESCRIPTION.

02:31:10.628 --> 02:31:13.164
ALL SCHEDULES -- TWO THREE FIVE

02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:14.698
OUR PRESCRIPTION ALTHOUGH THERE

02:31:14.765 --> 02:31:16.801
ARE SOME THAT LOOK SIMILAR LIKE

02:31:16.867 --> 02:31:18.469
A COUGH SYRUP WITH CODEINE.

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:19.937
WOULD BE A SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:21.639
WERE AS A COUGH SYRUP THAT IS

02:31:21.705 --> 02:31:23.474
OVER THE COUNTER IS NOT A

02:31:23.541 --> 02:31:26.110
SCHEDULED DRUG [inaudible]

02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:28.379

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:29.113
SHARE.

02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:30.881
WELL I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE

02:31:30.948 --> 02:31:32.716
POINT OF SAYING IS IS THAT --

02:31:32.783 --> 02:31:34.418
WELL WE'RE NOT ALL.

02:31:34.485 --> 02:31:36.454
CONTROL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES OR

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:38.956
SOMETHING THAT POTENTIAL -- AS A

02:31:39.023 --> 02:31:41.292
POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION SO

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:43.027
OBVIOUSLY SCHEDULE VICE VERY LOW

02:31:43.093 --> 02:31:44.862
AND SO THE MAIN OPIOID UNDERS

02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:47.164
CODING SO BY LIKE CODEINE HELP

02:31:47.231 --> 02:31:48.165
SUPPRESS COUGH THAT'S ANTI

02:31:48.232 --> 02:31:50.801
TOSSES -- BUT YOU ALSO HAVE SOME

02:31:50.868 --> 02:31:52.736
OTHER TYPES OF MEDICATION

THEY'RE ALSO SCHEDULE FIVE AS

02:31:54.672 --> 02:31:56.474
WELL -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE AGAIN

02:31:56.540 --> 02:31:58.676
VERY LOW POTENTIAL I I

02:31:58.742 --> 02:32:00.644
PERSONALLY AND I'M NOT OBJECTING

02:32:00.711 --> 02:32:02.947
TO INCLUDING SCHEDULE FIVE BUT I

02:32:03.013 --> 02:32:05.049
THINK THE CONCERN I HAVE IS IS

02:32:05.115 --> 02:32:05.583
THAT.

02:32:05.649 --> 02:32:06.984
IS THAT REMIND PEOPLE THERE'S A

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:08.285
LOT OF DRUGS THAT ARE

02:32:08.352 --> 02:32:09.787
MEDICATIONS THAT ARE ND

02:32:09.854 --> 02:32:12.122
SCHEDULES OF TWO THROUGH FIVE

02:32:12.189 --> 02:32:13.457
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO THROUGH AND

02:32:13.524 --> 02:32:14.492
THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED TO

02:32:14.558 --> 02:32:15.493
HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION

02:32:15.559 --> 02:32:17.661
ABOUT THE PRIVACY ISSUES BECAUSE

02:32:17.728 --> 02:32:18.796

ABOUT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:32:23.033 --> 02:32:24.969
OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT ARE ON

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:26.537
SCHEDULE TWO THROUGH.

02:32:26.604 --> 02:32:28.038
FIVE THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO

02:32:28.105 --> 02:32:32.042

TODAY WITH THE LEGISLATION

02:41:13.930 --> 02:41:15.232
BECAUSE IT JUST LIMITED IN THE

LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY THAT'S

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:18.235

LET ME SAY THAT -- I APPRECIATE

02:41:46.196 --> 02:41:47.597
AND UNDERSTAND FULLY THE

02:41:47.664 --> 02:41:49.766
COMMENTS FROM MY TWO COLLEAGUES

02:41:49.833 --> 02:41:51.935
ON THE PANEL HERE TODAY -- BUT I

02:41:52.002 --> 02:41:53.203
THINK YOU WERE TRYING TO SPEAK

02:41:53.270 --> 02:41:54.871
TO STRIKE A BALANCE HERE.

02:41:54.938 --> 02:41:58.442
AND WELL I I AS A LEGISLATOR WE

02:41:58.508 --> 02:41:59.609
LOVE OVERSIGHT AND WE LOVE THE

02:41:59.676 --> 02:42:01.211
ABILITY TO SAY YES FOR NOW.

02:42:01.278 --> 02:42:02.212
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO BE VERY

02:42:02.279 --> 02:42:03.680
PRAGMATIC ABOUT IT IN THE BILL

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:06.183
THAT YOU PUT FOR FORWARD TO US.

02:42:06.249 --> 02:42:10.353
I ALSO KNOW -- THAT -- ANY BOARD --

02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:13.223
AT THAT IS PAYING ATTENTION --

02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:14.691
THAT BEFORE THEY WERE TO DO

02:42:14.758 --> 02:42:16.159
ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN

02:42:16.226 --> 02:42:17.260
TERMS OF THE COST OF LIVING

02:42:17.327 --> 02:42:18.595
INCREASE WHICH IS ALL THAT THIS

02:42:18.662 --> 02:42:20.130
BILL WOULD ALLOW.

02:42:20.197 --> 02:42:21.098
I WOULD PROBABLY DO THEIR

02:42:21.164 --> 02:42:22.699
HOMEWORK AND CHECK IN WITH THE

02:42:22.766 --> 02:42:24.868
LEGISLATURE NO ONE LIKES TO BE

02:42:24.935 --> 02:42:26.002
REVERSED.

02:42:26.069 --> 02:42:27.370
AND THE FACT THAT SET UP THE

02:42:27.437 --> 02:42:28.772
MOST YOU COULD GET.

02:42:28.839 --> 02:42:30.073
OUT OF THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US

02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:32.809
IS -- THREE YEARS MAYBE OF A FEE --

02:42:32.876 --> 02:42:34.377
I THINK -- WOULD BE AN

02:42:34.444 --> 02:42:35.712
INDICATION THAT.

02:42:35.779 --> 02:42:38.148
THIS IS NOT RUN AWAY AUTHORITY

02:42:38.215 --> 02:42:39.749
FROM THIS PERSON'S POINT OF VIEW --

02:42:39.816 --> 02:42:41.184
BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THE LEARN

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:42.419
A JUDGMENT OF MY COLLEAGUES --

02:42:42.486 --> 02:42:44.121
WHO HAVE SPOKEN -- AND

02:42:44.187 --> 02:42:46.089
OPPOSITION TO IT BUT FOR ME I

02:42:46.156 --> 02:42:46.957
THOUGHT IT STRUCK THE RIGHT

02:42:47.023 --> 02:42:47.657
BALANCE.

02:42:47.724 --> 02:42:49.659
AND I THINK A GOOD THE

02:42:49.726 --> 02:42:50.894
ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS COULD BE

02:42:50.961 --> 02:42:52.195
PLACED IN IT WITH THE SUNSET

02:42:52.262 --> 02:42:54.698
THAT ALLOW IT TO GO INTO EFFECT.

02:42:54.764 --> 02:42:55.899
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN WE

02:42:55.966 --> 02:42:57.467
HAVE A CHANCE TO GO AND RE VISIT

02:42:57.534 --> 02:42:58.869
AGAIN.

02:42:58.935 --> 02:43:00.904
BUT I GUESS WE CAN WAIT AND SEE

02:43:00.971 --> 02:43:02.105
ME MIGHT DISCUSS THAT IN YOUR

02:43:02.172 --> 02:43:03.573
CLOTHES IF YOU WISH BUT I

02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:04.774
APPRECIATED THE THOUGHTFULNESS

02:43:04.841 --> 02:43:06.309
THAT YOU PUT INTO THIS.

02:43:06.376 --> 02:43:08.311
TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE SO

02:43:08.378 --> 02:43:09.713
WITH THAT WHEN A BUDGET MAKE ANY

02:43:09.779 --> 02:43:12.716
KIND OF CLOSING COMMENTS YES

02:43:12.782 --> 02:43:14.384
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK --

02:43:14.451 --> 02:43:15.752
THE THEY'RE STILL OF THE TYPE OF

02:43:15.819 --> 02:43:17.354
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:19.623
A CENTER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:43:19.689 --> 02:43:20.924
US IS THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY

02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:22.025
EVEN ROLL BACK.

02:43:22.092 --> 02:43:23.860
THE INCREASES SO WE STILL HAVE

02:43:23.927 --> 02:43:25.428
THAT AUTHORITY ASYOU WELL KNOW

02:43:25.495 --> 02:43:28.498
AS WELL AND ANY OF THESE

02:43:28.565 --> 02:43:30.567
ENTITIES BOARDS CAN PRESENT A

02:43:30.634 --> 02:43:32.035
BILL THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:43:32.102 --> 02:43:32.736
WHICH IT STILL HAS THE

02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:33.837
OPPORTUNITY CURRENTLY IN

02:43:33.904 --> 02:43:35.338
EXISTENCE. TO INCREASE THEIR

02:43:35.405 --> 02:43:37.841

02:43:37.908 --> 02:43:39.376
AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

02:43:39.442 --> 02:43:40.810

APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:43:43.647 --> 02:43:44.181
FINANCE.

02:43:44.247 --> 02:43:45.682
THIRD WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

02:43:45.749 --> 02:43:47.484
MANY MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT

02:43:47.551 --> 02:43:48.752
HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:43:48.818 --> 02:43:50.620

WHICH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC --

02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:08.505
CAN PARTICIPATE SO THEY'RE STILL

02:44:08.572 --> 02:44:10.774
SIGNIFICANT CHECKS AND BALANCES

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:13.643

02:44:14.344 --> 02:44:16.479

02:44:16.546 --> 02:44:18.315
THIS IS CHAIR WITH RESPECT TO

02:44:18.381 --> 02:44:19.416
THE TYPE OF ACCOUNTING

02:44:19.482 --> 02:44:21.384
TRANSPARENCY NOT JUST LINDEN.

02:44:21.451 --> 02:44:22.619
RIGHT RIGHT AWAY WITH IT WITHOUT

02:44:22.686 --> 02:44:24.854
HAVING PUBLIC INPUT SO WE STILL

02:44:24.921 --> 02:44:26.590
WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THAT

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:29.559
AUTHORITY -- SO THAT'S WHAT I

02:44:29.626 --> 02:44:31.328
WOULD SUGGEST IN TERMS OF THE

02:44:31.394 --> 02:44:33.029
COMMENTS -- AND AGAIN WE WANT TO

02:44:33.096 --> 02:44:36.199
PROVIDE GREATER CERTAINTY FOR

02:44:36.266 --> 02:44:39.336
NOT THESE INCREASES THAT JUST

02:44:39.402 --> 02:44:41.304
WOULD HAPPEN -- BUT RATHER AN

02:44:41.371 --> 02:44:42.872
OPTION.

02:44:42.939 --> 02:44:44.107

GREATER SENSE OF CERTAINTY WITH

02:44:45.141 --> 02:44:47.410
THAT -- TOO SO THAT BY SEN

02:44:47.477 --> 02:44:48.812
SEASONS AND WHY IS IT OF SEND

02:44:48.878 --> 02:44:50.113

HASN'T HAPPENED OVER A PERIOD OF

02:44:53.016 --> 02:44:53.416
TIME.

02:44:53.483 --> 02:44:56.453
SO IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY

02:44:56.519 --> 02:44:58.288
FOR THESE ENTITIES BOARDS TO

02:44:58.355 --> 02:44:59.356
