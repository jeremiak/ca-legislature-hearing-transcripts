DOCTOR WEBER YOU MAILED IT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. I RISE TODAY IN HONOR OF JUNETEENTH NATIONAL FREEDOM DAY. JUNE TENTH IS THE OLDEST AFRICAN AMERICAN HOLIDAY IN THE UNITED STATES. AND WAS FIRST CELEBRATED IN. EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE AFTER THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES BROKE OUT OVER POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS OF ENDING SLAVERY. PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S SIGNED THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. WHICH FREED THE SLAVES IN THE CONFEDERATE STATES. THIS SIGNATURE TOOK PLACE ON SEPTEMBER THE TWENTY SECOND. EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO AND IT WAS SIGNED WITH LINCOLN SAYING THAT IT WOULD ONLY GOING AFFECT. IF THE CONFEDERATE STATES. DID NOT A COME BACK INTO THE UNION. WHAT'S DEMONSTRATED HE HAD REALLY NO SERIOUS COMMITMENTS TO THE ENDING OF SLAVERY. BECAUSE THEY DID NOT COME BACK TO THE UNION. ON JANUARY FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WENT INTO EFFECT. HOWEVER THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION DIDN'T FREE SLAVES STATE SLAVES IN STATES THAT WEREN'T IN REBELLION. LIKE THE STATE OF TEXAS. THREE YEARS AFTER THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION THERE WAS STILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. IN BONDAGE IN TEXAS. ON JUNE. EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHEN THE UNION ARMY ROLLED INTO GALVESTON THEY DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MANY MANY SLAVES STILL IN EXISTENCE IN TEXAS. AND THEY WERE INFORMED AT THAT TIME. THAT THEY HAD BEEN FREE FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS. THEY BEGAN TO REJOICE. AND A SPONTANEOUS CELEBRATION TOOK PLACE. A YEAR LATER. THE FIRST ANNUAL JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION TOOK PLACE IN GALVESTON TEXAS. JUNETEENTH IS A COMBINATION BETWEEN THE WORD OF JUNE AND NINETEEN THIS CELEBRATION WAS THE PLAYER WAS BASICALLY CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH. AND OVER THE YEARS MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO IGRATED FROM THE SOUTH BEGIN TO TAKE JUNETEENTH WITH THEM. THE CELEBRATION DECLINED IN THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. BUT THERE WAS A RESURGENT OF IT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. TODAY JUNE TENTH IS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITH SEVERAL TRADITIONS. INCLUDING PARADES PICNICS BARBECUES AND BIG RED SODA THAT YOU WILL SEE IN THE LOUNGE. THE SODA IS A STAPLE OF THE JUNETEENTH GET TOGETHERS WHEN COMMUNITIES JOIN TOGETHER TO REFLECT ON THE HARDSHIP IN DORT BY AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT THE PERILOUS MIDDLE PASSAGE TO THE BRUTALITY OF SLAVERY AND JIM CROW TO THE STRUGGLES WE FACE TODAY. IT IS ALWAYS ALSO A TIME TO CELEBRATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND RICH CULTURAL TRADITIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. A CULTURE SHAPE BY THE HISTORY OF PERSEVERANCE STRENGTH AND HOPE. CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR TO PROCLAIM THE THIRD SATURDAY IN JUNE OF EACH YEAR TO BE KNOWN AS JUNETEENTH. FREEDOM NATIONAL DAY. A DAY OF OBSERVANCE TO URGE ALL CALIFORNIANS IN CELEBRATING THIS DAY TO HONOR AND REFLECT ON THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE PLAYED IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. AND HOW AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE BEEN RICH SOCIETY THROUGH THEIR STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING FREEDOM BROTHERHOOD AND EQUALITY. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN PROCLAIMING JUNE NINETEENTH. JUNETEENTH NATIONAL FREEDOM DAY AND I ASK FOR IT I VOTE FOR A C. R.. EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISS RUBIO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM MISTER SPEAKER IN MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF A C. R.. EIGHTY SIX I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. TODAY WE RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THE FREEDOM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN SLAVES AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN COMMEMORATE THIS HISTORICAL MILESTONE AND RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP. TOWARDS EQUALITY AND JUSTICE. THE SLEEVES OF GALVESTON TEXAS HAD TO WAIT MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER LINCOLN'S TO CREE TO RECEIVE WORD THAT THEY WERE FREED. WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT MANY OF THE SLAVES FELT. ANXIOUSLY AWAITING FOR THE NEWS OF THEIR FREEDOM. DESPITE THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION AND RATIFICATION OF THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT THE STRUGGLE FOR EQUALITY FOR FORMER SLAVES THEIR DESCENDANTS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAS PROVEN LONG AND HARD. WHILE WE CELEBRATE OUR HARD FOUGHT VICTORIES WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT DISCRIMINATION BUT DISCRIMINATION THAT STILL EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS WE COMMEMORATE JUNETEENTH WE MUST BE COGNIZANT OF THE CONTINUED NEED TO COME TO COMBAT RACISM. HATE AND INTOLERANCE THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU HISTORY OF HIS RACE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF A C. R. EIGHTY SIX RECOGNIZING JUNE NINETEENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF JUNETEENTH. AS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED JUNETEENTH IS A CELEBRATION OF WHEN THE LAST SLAVES IN AMERICA WERE FREED. NEARLY TWO AND A HALF YEARS AFTER THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE A UNIQUE AND OFTEN PAINFUL HISTORY IN AMERICA AND THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT ONLY A CELEBRATION. BUT A RECOGNITION OF A RESPONSE FROM A COMMUNITY ONE BUILT ON STRENGTH RESILIENCE AND FORTITUDE. JUNETEENTH ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE FOLLOW THROUGH AND PERSISTENCE NECESSARY TO ENACT JUSTICE. THE NEED TO NOT ONLY PASSED JUST LAWS BUT TO ENSURE. THEY DO WHAT IS INTENDED AND THAT THOSE IMPACTED BY THE LAWS ARE MADE AWARE OF THE CHANGES. THAT IS HOW TO TRULY MOVE FORWARD IN WAYS THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED. THE LATINO CAUCUS STANDS IN SOLIDARITY IN RECOGNITION OF THIS CRITICAL ANNIVERSARY AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A C. R.. EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU MS RACE. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE RESOLUTION DOCTOR WEBER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES ARE RISING THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF JUNETEENTH I'M OFTEN REMINDED OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS THIS FOURTH OF JULY ADDRESS. FREDERICK DOUGLASS WAS INVITED TO SPEAK BEFORE THE DAUGHTERS OF THE REVOLUTION IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES. AND THEY HAD EXPECTED HIM TO TELL ALL THE WONDERS OF THE FOURTH OF JULY. THE WONDERS OF THIS NEW CELEBRATE THE CELEBRATION OF FREEDOM. AND HE TALKED ABOUT IT AND THEN HE SAID IF I BASICALLY FAIL TO REMIND YOU WHO WE ARE. IT WOULD BE A CRIME IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR THE NATION'S FOR ME NOT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE FOURTH OF JULY REALLY MEANS TO ME. AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW SLAVERY HAD DENIED HIM ALL OF HIS FREEDOM. ALL OF HIS RIGHTS IN ALL OF HIS HUMANITY. AND HE SAID SO THEREFORE MY SUBJECT TODAY WILL BE AMERICAN SLAVERY AND NOT THE FOURTH OF JULY. AND HE SAID THAT IF I COULD GET THE JERUSALEM. THEN MAY MY RIGHT HAND FORGET ARE CUTTING INTO YOUR TONGUE CLEAVE TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH. AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS CELEBRATION JUNETEENTH. WE LOOK AT HOW FAR WE'VE COME. AND YET HOW FAR WE HAVE NOT COME AS A NATION. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE STRUGGLED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THE SAD THING IS EVEN IN THIS TIME FRAME MANY OF US FEEL AS IF WE ARE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN THE WINDOW OF FREEDOM. THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PICTURE AND THE CELEBRATION THAT'S THEIR AND IT'S VERY PAINFUL TO RECOGNIZE THAT. I REMEMBER ONCE AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I TENDED TO BE A CELEBRATION ON BEHALF OF THE LINCOLN AND WASHINGTON CELEBRATION OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND I SAW IN THE FACE OF SO MANY WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY. THE TEARS THAT THEY SHARE AT THAT MOMENT. AND I BIG REALIZE THAT I FELT LIKE AROUND BEEN IT THE HISTORIAN. WHO SAID WHEN HE WENT TO THE FREEDOM OF GHANA? AND HE SAW WHEN THEY HAD GOTTEN THEIR FREEDOM IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. HE SAW THE TEARS ON THEIR FACE AND THE AND THE WONDER THAT THEY HAD IN THEIR HEARTS OF OF ONCE AGAIN GETTING FREEDOM AGAIN. AND HE SAID HE FELT LIKE AN OUTSIDER AGAIN. BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME PASSION AND THE SAME LOVE NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIED. AND I THINK ABOUT THAT IN RELATIONSHIP TO US AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. WAS STILL TRYING TO TELL THEIR STORY ABOUT FREEDOM. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PAINFUL SLAVERY WAS AND WHAT IT TOOK FROM US AS A PEOPLE. AS WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO MAKE A LIFE IN THIS NATION. A PAINFUL SITUATION THAT IS THERE. IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO BE SURE TO LOOK AT THE SMITHSONIAN AND LISTEN TO THE TAPES OF THE SMITHSONIAN THAT TALKED ABOUT. IN NINETEEN THIRTY WHEN THEY WENT AND THEY INTERVIEWED FORMER SLAVES. AND YOU HEAR THEIR VOICES. AND YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AFTER THEY WERE FREED. HOW THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING? NOT EVEN A GOOD CLOSE NOT SHOES ONLY NOT A PENNY IN THEIR POCKET. AND HOW THEY HAD TO STRUGGLE SO HARD JUST TO MAKE AN EXISTENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SOMEONE SAID TO THE ONE PERSON HE SAID. BEEN REALLY HE SAID YOU WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO REMAIN IN SLAVERY BECAUSE AT LEAST YOU KNEW WHO OWNS YOU AND WHERE YOU WOULD STAY IN WHERE YOU WOULD SLEEP IN WHERE YOU WOULD EAT. AND THIS MAN SAID AND I REMEMBER THIS SO CLEARLY BECAUSE IT WAS AT THE END OF THE FILM HE SAID IF I THOUGHT. FOR ONE MOMENT. THAT SLAVERY WOULD COME BACK TOMORROW. I WOULD KILL MYSELF TODAY. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO STRUGGLE REALLY HARD IN THIS COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND THE PAIN THAT IS THERE. BUT IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THAT WE HAVE TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THE JOY THAT WE HAVE. IN THIS COUNTRY IS AFRICAN AMERICANS. AS WE STRUGGLE CONSTANTLY WITH AN APPLE OPTIMISTIC VIEW POINT. THAT THE WORLD WILL BE BETTER TOMORROW THAT EVERYTHING WE DO WILL CHANGE THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN. AND THAT WE HAVE THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE GENERATION THAT FINALLY OVERCOMES SOME OF THE MONSTERS OF OUR OUR FOREFATHERS. THEN WE CAN PIERCE THOSE PARTS. THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I REMEMBER I WROTE AN ARTICLE AFTER OBAMA WON IN IOWA. AND I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN MY CLASSROOM. AND I WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR A MAGAZINE IN OCEANSIDE THIS SAYS PLANTING TREES WITHOUT SEEING THE FOREST. BECAUSE I HAD BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO CHANGE THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN MY CLASSES AND WHEN I LOOKED UP THERE WAS A FOREST OF GOOD WILL. AND SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT THERE IS JOY IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. YOU WILL HEAR SOME OF THE DAY WHEN YOU HEAR A SONG THAT'S GOING TO BE SOME. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT DESPITE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED THERE IS NO BITTERNESS. WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT NOT BEING BITTER BUT BEING BETTER. AND I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU ALSO TODAY TO PUT PUT WITHIN YOURSELF TO UNDERSTAND THE PAIN THAT HAS EXISTED IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND DESPITE THAT WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE EVERY DAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A C. R. EIGHTY SIX AND THAT THE FIRST ROLE WAS OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS.

TWENTY NINETEEN TO EXTEND THE DURATION OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS TO SIX MONTHS BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE 290%. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO CREATE OUR REGION EDUCATION GRANT PROGRAM FOR DOMESTIC WORKERS. IT ALSO ELIMINATES PAYROLL DEFERRALS FOR EMPLOYEES AND MAKES OTHER CHANGES RELATED TO LABOR THE POINT. WITH THAT WE RESPECT FOR US RIGHT NOW. NAME IS CHIANG MISTER OF AN OLDIE MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHTY THREE THIS TRAILER BILL INCREASES THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM FROM SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS WE HAVE A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL IN THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. AND EVERYONE WANTS TO PRETEND THAT THIS COMES WITHOUT A COST BUT THE COST INVOLVED IS SUBSTANTIAL THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IS PART OF THE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM AN STI IS FUNDED. THROUGH A PAYROLL TAX DEDUCTION ON THE PAYCHECK OF EVERY WORKER IN CALIFORNIA THE AMOUNT OF THAT PAYROLL DEDUCTION IS SET EVERY YEAR DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR AGAINST THE PROGRAM AND THE BALANCE ON THE PROGRAM FUND. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST TELLS US THAT INCREASING PAID FAMILY LEAVE FROM SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS WILL CAUSE A 10% GREATER SUBSCRIPTION RATE FOR THE NEXT YEAR THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR WHICH MEANS I PAYROLL TAX. WILL HAVE TO GO UP 10% OR HIGHER THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT IT. IF YOU DO THE MATH THAT WILL RESULT IN ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS LESS IN THE POCKET OF EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA WORKER IN THE NEXT YEAR. NOW THAT MIGHT NOT BE A LOT OF MONEY TO YOU OR TO ME BUT FOR SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT SIXTY DOLLARS A YEAR IS A LOT OF MONEY -- AND I DID IT SO IT'S NOT WITHOUT A COST EVEN MORE TROUBLING IS THE TASK FORCE THAT THIS TRAILER BILL ESTABLISHES TO TRY AN INCREASE THE PAID FAMILY FROM EIGHT WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS WHICH WOULD BE MANY TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE.

MISTER TECH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SB EIGHTY SEVEN IS OUR TRANSPORTATION BUDGET TRAILER BILL IT REPAYS ALL OUTSTANDING GENERAL FUND TRANSPORTATION LOANS IN. NINETEEN TWENTY THIS INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION FROM THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION RELIEF FUND. IN APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION IN LOANS WAIT FEES.

THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY SB ONE IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A COMPETITIVE GRANT. PROGRAM FOR SHORTLINE RAILROAD PROJECTS USING UP TO SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION FROM THE TRADE CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENTS. NAME IS CHIANG MISTER OVER. NINETY MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHTY SEVEN COLLEGE THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECT OF THIS TRAILER BILL IN MY OPINION IS RELATED TO VEHICLE WEIGHT FEES AS YOU KNOW VEHICLE WEIGHT FEES. ARE CHARGED TO OPERATORS OF LARGE COMMERCIAL VEHICLES TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE OF THOSE VEHICLES DUE TO THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE. STICK HEARD STATE LAW ALLOWS THOSE WAIT FEES TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GENERAL FUND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REPAY TRANSPORTATION RELATED BOND AT THAT'S AN ACTUAL THAT I'VE OPPOSED IN THE PAST BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER THIS TRAILER BILL MAKES THE FART SITUATION FAR WORSE IT ALLOWS THOSE REVENUES TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GENERAL FUND WITHOUT LIMIT ESSENTIALLY AND BE USED FOR THE REPAYMENT OF FUTURE. TRANSPORTATION BOND LEAD IN ANY YEAR SO IN OTHER WORDS ALL OF THOSE VEHICLE WEIGHT FEES CAN BE DIVERTED TO THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT IN THE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT. COLLEAGUES WHEN THE OPERATORS OF THESE COMMERCIAL VEHICLES PAY THESE FEES IT IS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY BE USED. TO MAINTAIN OF THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS VERY INAPPROPRIATE AND I REGIONAL VOTE. MR FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKE MEMBERS REMEMBER. THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE SAID THAT THERE WAS A FIFTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG. IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON OUR CALIFORNIA HIGHWAYS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND MILES OF HIGHWAY.

TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE BILL LIMITS CD TSA'S ABILITY TO DEMAND PAYMENT OF TAXES DUE FROM SPECIFIC RETAILERS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS TO CREATE A PROCESS. UNDER WHICH A PERSON FILING APPEAL MAY CHOOSE TO APPEAR BEFORE ONE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE RATHER THAN A PANEL UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE THE STRUGGLE. MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY TWO THIS BILL WOULD EXEMPT FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND DIAPERS FROM SALES TAX BUT ONLY FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS AND WE HAD A VERY ROBUST ARGUMENT ABOUT THIS. IN THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE DESIRE TO MAKE THIS EXEMPTION PERMANENT THE ADMINISTRATION INSISTED THAT THAT ARE ONLY BE FOR TWO YEARS AND THE REASON FOR THAT IN SYSTEMS. SO THAT THEY COULD LABEL IT A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE REVENUE INSTEAD OF AN ONGOING EXPENDITURE REVENUE NOW I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THAT IS JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD IS ASKING.

THEY WISH TING MEASURE OF ARNOLDI MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION SB NINETY FOUR THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD MOVE THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION.

THE DJJ CURRENTLY HOUSES SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS WHO HAVE ALL COMMITTED THE MOST SERIOUS FELONY OFFENSES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CRIMINAL CODE I'M TALKING ABOUT THINGS.

THE THE IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED THAT WE ARE SHORT ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY JUDGES IN CALIFORNIA SO TWENTY FIVE IS A GOOD START. ALSO THE REMOVAL OF THAT 1% CAP IN THE IMPOSITION OF A 3% CAP ON JUDICIAL RESERVES WILL HELP COURTS PLAN FOR THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURE ALTHOUGH.

WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE THIS IS SB NINETY SIX THE CORPORATE. SENATE BILL NINETY SIX BUT THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AND ACTUALLY TAXATION CLEARING THE URGENCY THERE UP TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY YOUR TECH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SB NINETY SIX IS PERTAINING TO OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM -- IF WE HAVEN'T FOUND THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM TO BE IMPORTANT -- BEFORE IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS GIVEN THE NUMBER OF DISASTERS WE'VE HAD. UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT FIRST RESPONDERS CAN GET TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS FAST AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. SO BEGINNING IN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THIS BILL AMENDS THE STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE USERS SURCHARGE ACT WHICH IMPOSES A MONTHLY SURCHARGE AMOUNT OF NOT GREATER THAN EIGHTY CENTS NOT GREATER THAN EIGHTY CENTS. PER ACCESS LINE TO FUND THE CURRENT FISCAL YEARS NINE ONE ONE COSTS. ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THE BILL WOULD IMPOSE A SURCHARGE FOR PREPAID MOBILE TELEPHONE SERVICES AT THE TIME OF EACH RETAIL TRANSACTION IN THE STATE. AT THE RATE EQUAL TO THE MONTHLY SURCHARGE AMOUNT PER ACCESS LINE TO BE PAID BY THE PREPAID CUSTOM CONSUMERS. AND COLLECTORS OF SELLERS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE SURCHARGE BE REMITTED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. THE BILL ALLOWS NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE IN THE SUBSEQUENT TECHNOLOGIES INTERFACES NEED TO DELIVER. NINE ONE ONE VOICE AND DATA INFORMATION WITHIN THE MEANING OF BASIC SYSTEM FOR THE PURPOSES OF STATE EMERGENCY NUMBER ACCOUNT EXPENDITURES. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE FOR SB. NINETY SIX MR OF ANALYTICS MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINETY SIX THIS BILL WILL IMPOSE A SURCHARGE OF UP TO EIGHTY CENTS PER LINE ON EVERY PHONE LINE AND CELL PHONE IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD HOPE WE COULD ALL AGREE THAT FUNDING NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE SHOULD BE A STATE PRIORITY HOWEVER KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'RE DOING THIS IN A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS. WE COULD EASILY FUND THIS PROGRAM FROM THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF ASKING CALIFORNIANS TO PAY MORE MANY OF WHOM ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS EVERY DAY. I ALSO LIKE YOU COULD CONSIDER THIS EVEN IF YOU FEEL LIKE A PER MONTH PER LINE SURCHARGES THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO FUND THIS PROGRAM. WHY ARE WE BEING ASKED TO AUTHORIZE UP TO EIGHTY CENTS PER LINE WHEN THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ITSELF SAYS THAT ONLY THIRTY FOUR CENTS PER LINE IS REQUIRED TO FULLY FUND THE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW? I WOULD ASK YOU TO IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE NO AT LEAST OF STAYING UNTIL WE CAN STEP AT MAXIMUM CAP DOWN TO AROUND FORTY CENTS PER LINE WHICH WOULD BE A MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE LEVEL. I URGE A NO VOTE. MISS SMITH YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TRAILER BILL IN THIS MEASURE IS SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WHICH IS A PUBLIC GOOD. I WOULD HAZARD A GUESS THAT MOST OF US IN THIS ROOM AT SOME POINT IN OUR LIVES HAVE PICKED UP THE PHONE TO DIAL. FIRE HAD A LOVED ONE IN DISTRESS HAD SOME OTHER NEED THAT REQUIRED FIRST RESPONDERS TO COME TO OUR AID IMMEDIATELY. YES WE HAVE A SURPLUS BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE A SURPLUS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE EMERGENCIES GIVEN THE NATURE OF HOW WE ALL COMMUNICATE AND HOW WE PAY FOR THOSE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WE NEED TO PUT THIS MEASURE IN PLACE TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY OF A SYSTEM WE ALL COUNT ON OUR CONSTITUENTS ALL COUNT ON EVERY DAY AND IN PERPETUITY SO I CAN REALLY REALLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE.
