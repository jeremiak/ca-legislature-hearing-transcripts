SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY NUMBER SENATOR MITCHELL AN ACRYLATE HEALING ARTS. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SENATE BILL SIX THREE NINE WILL STRENGTHEN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS SURROUNDING MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS OFFER TO PATIENTS BY MEDICAL PROVIDERS. CURRENTLY CONSUMERS RECEIVE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS BUT OFTEN. DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW SOMETHING CALLED DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISIONS MAY WORK COLLEAGUES I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. YOU GET CAUGHT OFF GUARD WHEN THEY'RE FINANCED A THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOU PAY OFF NINE HUNDRED BY THE INTO THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD BUT THEN HIT WITH 27% INTEREST RATE CHARGED NOT ON THE REMAINING BALANCE OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS THE POTENTIALLY ON THE ORIGINAL CHARGE OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS BILL PROHIBITS MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM OFFERING PRODUCTS WITH DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISIONS AND PROHIBITS MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM CHARGING TO MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS SERVICES NOT YET RENDERED. I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER MITCHELL. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT TO KNOW WELCOME BACK COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION SB -- SIX THIRTY NINE THE ORGANIZATION THAT OVERSEES HE'S LEARNING -- COMPANIES -- THEY HAVE A A PRETTY GOOD RATING -- RATING. 80% OF THESE LOANS ARE PAID OFF AND 20% ULTIMATELY. HAVE THE INTEREST CHARGE THAT ARE -- APPLY TO THEM OF THERE ARE A LOT OF MEDICAL SERVICES SAID UNFORTUNATELY -- SOME INSURANCES DON'T PAY FOR THAT. ARE NECESSARY AS AN EXAMPLE -- ORTHODONTICS YOUR WORK -- I CAME FROM A VERY -- LOW INCOME FAMILY. I HAD A SIGNIFICANT OVERBITE. I HAD TO WEAR BRACES NOT THREE YEARS NOW FOR YEARS I HAD TO WEAR BRACES EIGHT YEARS TO GET THE TEETH BACK INTO THE THE MOUSE. WHEN I WAS -- BORN I ALSO HAD -- SOME LARGE EARS THAT WERE SO LARGE I WAS -- BULLIED IN SCHOOL WHEN. THE PARENTS -- GOT SOME MONEY -- LOAN TO THEM. TO HAVE MY EARS SURGICALLY TEN BACK TO MY HEAD [inaudible] SO. I WORRY THAT. WE ARE GOING TO BE FORCING A LOT OF THESE. FAMILIES THAT WANT TO GET THE SELECTIVE BUT NECESSARY HEALTH SERVICES. TO GO -- TO PAYDAY LOAN PLACES PAY EXORBITANT INTEREST. SURRENDER APART THEIR CARS UP FOR COLLATERAL LOSE THEIR CARS -- THERE'S JUST A LOT OF SURGERIES THAT PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE THE LIQUIDITY. TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES AN EXAMPLE IF YOU GOT A TRIAL THAT -- NEEDS LASIX SURGERY ABOUT WANT TO DRIVE A CAR THE YOU KNOW -- WE PREFER. NOT TO HAVE THE GLASSES WITH THEM ALL THE TIME -- THE LEASE BECAUSE THEN SAFER AND MORE IT'S MORE PREVALENT TODAY BUT IT STILL COULD BE RATHER RATHER COSTLY [inaudible] AND SO. YOU KNOW WE AS AN INSTITUTION TRY TO BAN -- PREDATORY -- INSTITUTIONS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE THOSE LESS FORTUNATE THAN OURSELVES. I WORRY THAT I THINK THE INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR ARE GOOD HERE. BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE PUSHING A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO GET HESE MEDICAL SERVICES ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. TO GO TO PREDATORY LENDERS -- WHEN IN FACT 80% OF THEM PAID THESE LOANS OFF -- WITHOUT -- PAYING A LOT OF INTEREST OR ANY INTEREST AT ALL. SO -- YOU KNOW I I REALLY. HOPE THE CHILL Là YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO HURT THOSE OVER TRYING -- TO HELP AND FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE IN SB. SIX THIRTY NINE THANK YOU CENTER STONE. ANY OTHER DEBATE THING NONE CENTER MITCHELL WOULD YOU CARE TO CLOSE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF MY GOOD INTENTIONS. Là AND WITH THAT LET ME CLARIFY WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY THIS -- IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT. MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS. ONE TWO IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT 0% INTRODUCTORY OFFER YOU OFFER PERIODS. NUMBER THREE IT MERELY PROHIBITS THE CHARGING OF INTEREST ON AMOUNTS ALREADY PAID OFF. KNOWN AS DEFERRED INTEREST. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID IF. WITH THE PRIMARY COMPANY WHO PROVIDES THIS THIS CREDIT OPPORTUNITY SAYS THAT 80% OF THE LOANS ARE PAID OFF DURING THE 0% INTEREST PERIOD. THAT'S A GREAT. LET'S LOOK AT THE 20% THAT AREN'T. THAT ARE ASKED TO PAID INTEREST AND A AT A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE. ON PORTIONS OF THE LOAN THEY'VE ALREADY PAID OFF. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT ELIMINATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED CREDIT. THEY HAVE A MEDICAL PROCEDURE DONE TO GET IT. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE 0% INTEREST PERIOD IT DOES NOT. WHAT IT SAYS IS DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISIONS? OPPORTUNISTIC FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD THEM THE LEAST. FOR THOSE REASONS I ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THE LET ME JUST CLARIFY. THAT THIS BILL HAS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND UP TO THIS POINT HAS RECEIVE NO NO VOTE. I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER MITCHELL MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. HI ARCHULETA.

WITHOUT OBJECTION PHOTOGRAPHER PHOTOGRAPHER WILL BE ALLOWED ON THE FLOOR FOR TODAY'S SESSION MOVING BACK TO THIRD READING. BUT NOW UP TO FILE ITEM. ONE THIRTY FIVE SB SEVEN FORTY TWO CENTER ALLEN ARE YOU READY. SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SOME FORTY TWO BY SENATOR ALLEN AND ACTUALLY TRANSPORTATION. CENTER AT THE PRESIDENT THAT THIS BILL REMOVES PROHIBITIONS ARE CURRENTLY EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW THAT HAMSTRING. IMPORTANT NETWORK OF PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED INNER CITY BUSES FROM BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE -- WRITERS WITH WITH WITH RIGHTS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED EACH YEAR TO REGIONAL JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES TO OPERATE MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE CALIFORNIA'S INTERCITY. PASSENGER RAIL CORRIDORS. I THESE QUARTERS ARE BOLSTERED THROUGH A LARGE NETWORK OF THROUGH A PROCESS THAT BRANCH OUT FROM RAIL STATIONS TO CONNECT WRITERS TO OVERTURN A FIFTY TOWNS AND COMMUNITIES. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND EVEN INTO NEVADA. THESE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE TRAVEL OPTIONS ARE NOT SIMPLY BETWEEN URBAN HUBS BUT OFTENTIMES THEY SERVE OUT OF THE WAY MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NO OTHER FORM. OF OF OF INNER CITY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. NOW HERE'S WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE REAL THROUGH A BUS IS OFTEN OPERATE FAR BELOW CAPACITY. AND PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH OUR CURRENT LAW. EVEN IF THE BUS STARTS FROM A ROUTE FROM A TRAIN STATION WITH ALL THAT SEAT OCCUPIED -- AS IT TRAVELS FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER OFTEN GETS EMPTIER EMPTIER MORE MORE EMPTY AS THE ROOT MOVES A LOT. THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE CURRENT LAW DOESN'T ALLOW THAT BUSES RUNNING ANYWAY. TO PICK UP NEW PASSENGERS ALONG THE WAY. SO WHAT THIS LAW DOES IS IT REMOVES A STEEP IN WHICH PROHIBITS RAIL THROUGH A BUSES FROM SELLING TICKETS. TO ANY PASSENGER UNLESS HE OR SHE AYE THE ROAD ON A TRAIN BEFORE CATCHING THAT BUS OR IS WRITING ON THAT BUS TO CATCH A TRAIN. IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR FOR GOVERNMENT TO BLOCK UBER A LIFT FROM OFFERING COMPETITIVELY PRICED RIGHTS TO PASSENGERS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE CHOOSE. TO WRITE A CITY BUS AND IT'S NOT FAIR FOR CALIFORNIA STATUTE TO BLOCK PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED BY SERVICES FROM COMPETING AGAINST PRIVATE COMPANIES. ARE THIS MEASURE SPURS GREATER COMPETITIONIN THE OPEN MARKET PLACE TO HELP GOVERNMENTS SPEND. TAXPAYER MONEY MORE EFFICIENTLY IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY ASK REVIVAL IT MEANS CAME TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I ONCE -- WAS WAS ON THAT WAS ON IT I LITERALLY HAD TO BUY A BUS TICKET ONCE IT PLUS THE TRAIN TICKET AFTERWARDS JUST TO BE ABLE TO RIDE THE BUS THAT WAS. RUNNING ANYWAY ON AMTRAK AND IT'S A SENSIBLE BILL IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY I'VE GOT STRIVE. THIS BILL IS A CANDID FOR UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL.

MOVING ON TO ITEM ONE THIRTY EIGHT SB THREE OH FIVE SENATOR HUESO. YOU MAY PROCEED -- SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THREE OH FIVE A SENATOR HUESO AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT RYAN'S LAW. SB. THREE OH FIVE RYAN BARTEL WAS JUST FORTY TWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PANCREATIC CANCER. HE IMMEDIATELY SAW CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS OF RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY. BUT THE CAT CANCER CANCER HAD ALREADY SPREAD THROUGHOUT HIS BODY. HE WAS GIVING STRONG OAK OPIOIDS MORPHINE AND FENTANYL FOR HIS -- PAIN MANAGEMENT. BUT THIS MEDICATION -- MAINLY PUT HIM TO SLEEP AND UNAWARE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS HE SPENT MOST OF THE DAY ASLEEP. FINALLY A CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND RECOMMENDED MEDICAL CANNABIS FEES OF THE SEA CBD OIL. AND THE CHANGES WERE REMARKABLE. RYAN WAS ALERT. AWAKE SPEAKING TO HIS FAMILY. AND HIS YOUNG SON. HE WAS IN GOOD SPIRITS AND HAD AN APPETITE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS. HOWEVER THIS WAS SHORT LIVED. TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS AND DEEP SUFFERING WERE RECEIVING CARE IN CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ARE DENIED ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS. RYAN'S FAMILY WAS FORCED TO SEARCH FOR WEEKS FOR FACILITY THAT ALLOWED HIM TO YOU SEE BEAUTY OIL. TO HELP MANAGE AS PAIN EFFECTIVELY. IN FACT. OF THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CREEK CREDITS MEDICAL CANNABIS WITH NUMEROUS MEDICINAL BENEFITS INCLUDING RICH REDUCING NAUSEA VOMITING AND PAIN. FINALLY OUT AFTER WEEKS OF SURGE. THIRTEEN A FACILITY IN WASHINGTON STATE. ALLOWED RYAN TO CONTINUE USING HIS C. B. D. OIL. SADLY RYAN ONLY LIVED A FEW MORE WEEKS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S PASS PROP TWO FIFTEEN AUTHORIZING MEDICAL CANNABIS OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO HOSPITALS IN THE STATE DO NOT ALLOW ITS USE BY PEACE PATIENTS. IN HOSPITAL PREMISES THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLOSE THE GAP. BY LOVE LAW IN THOSE WHO MOST NEED. A COMPASSION AT THE END OF LIFE TO HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS IF THEY POSSESS A RECOMMENDATION BY A PHYSICIAN OR A MEDICAL MARIJUANA CARD. SMOKING OF MARIJUANA AND HEALTH CARE'S FACILITIES IT'S EXPERT EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED UNDER THIS BILL. WE HAVE MADE A NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO EXPAND THE USE. OF OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA AND AND TO ALLOW ITS USE BUT I THINK NOTHING IS MORE DESERVING. THEN -- FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THEIR FINAL DAYS -- AND INCREDIBLE SUFFERING -- MEMBERS AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. THANK YOU CENTER HUESO ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE -- SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I A STAND -- AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF SB THREE OH FIVE AND ONE TO COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO I'M BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS BY GIVING THEM ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. THE FATHER OF THE BOY THAT THIS BILL IS KNOWN. FOR RYAN'S LAW TESTIFIED BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE. AND HE SPOKE FROM THE HEART. HIS SON RYAN WAS DYING OF CANCER IN ENORMOUS PAIN AND SADLY AT SUCH. A VERY YOUNG AGE. BUT AS WE SEE OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE GET. END STAGE CARE THROUGH HOSPICES OR IN THE HOSPITAL. THE DOCTORS OFTEN THROW NARCOTICS ADAM THEY THROW FENTON ALLOWED A MORPHINE ADAM DILAUDID IN THE PROBLEM. IS THAT YOU ARE MITIGATING THEIR PAIN BUT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS -- LAST FEW HOURS OF THEIR LIFE ON THIS PLANET. YOUR RENDERING THEM TO BE UNCONSCIOUS. AND MANY OF THESE TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS INCLUDING RYAN WANTED TO BE ALERT AND AWAKE. AND SPENT EVERY PRECIOUS MOMENT THEY HAVE LEFT ON THIS PLANET. WITH HIS LOVE ONES. BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT HE COULD DO THAT. BECAUSE HE DISCOVERED THE CANNABIS COULD TAKE HIS PAIN AWAY AND WOULD NOT BECOME UNCONSCIOUS. WAS TO CONTINUE THE UTILIZATION. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE LEGALLY COULDN'T DO HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR CURRENT LAWS. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. MEDICAL MARIJUANA NOW FOR OVER A DECADE AND WE'VE LEARNED THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE THAT THERE ARE MANY EFFICACIES MANY WONDERFUL USES FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS THAT. WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE FRANKLY BECAUSE WAS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG WE DID ALLOW INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS STANFORD UCLA THAT WE RECOGNIZE TODAY UC DAVIS TO STUDY. THE MEDICAL EFFICACY OF OF CANNABIS BUT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVEN'T SHOWN. IT TO BE A VERY -- GOOD DRUG. AS A PHARMACIST I CAN TELL YOU THE CANNABIS HAS A POTENTIAL OF HELPING PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR PAIN. AND WITHOUT MANY OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS OF OPIOIDS. I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT A DYING PATIENT SHOULD NEVER LIVE HIS OR HER LAST DAYS. IN NEEDLESS PAIN OR AGONY. THE FTA ALREADY APPROVED CERTAIN CANNABIS DERIVATIVES LIKE SEE MEDIAN ERIN ALL. BECAUSE OF THEIR PROVEN MEDICINAL VALUE. AND WHILE THE FDA HAS ADMITTED CERTAIN VALUE TO CANNABIS DERIVATIVES ITS INSISTENCE ON CALLING THIS A CLASS ONE DRUG IS MEANT A SEVERE LACK OF CLINICAL STUDIES. ON THE BENEFITS OF DYING PATIENTS WHO NEEDLESSLY SUFFER AND SHOULDN'T HAVE. TO AND WHILE THE FTA AS CONTINUES PRACTICE OF TREATING MARIJUANA THE SAME AS HER WHEN THIRTY THREE STATES NOW. EMBRACE MEDICAL CANNABIS AS WE HAVE LED THE WAY. NOT BECAUSE STUDIES DONE HERE IN THE US BUT BECAUSE OF STUDIES CONDUCTED TO COUNTRIES LIKE ISRAEL THE PROOF THAT MARIJUANA -- AND ITS SECOND GENER IS TRULY HAVE MEDICINAL VALUE. WE CERTAINLY KNOW AGAIN THAT MARINOL VENUES FOR AIDS TO STOP THE WASTING SYNDROME AND CHEMOTHERAPY PATIENTS SO THEY CAN KEEP FOOD DOWN. AFTER THEY GET SOME OF THESE TOXIC DRUGS OR POSTAL POISONOUS TO THEIR BODY. IF CANNABIS IS THE MEDICATION ALLOWS A PERSON TO BETTER COPE WITH PAIN AND SUFFERING THEIR FINAL HOURS AND WE SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEM. AND ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT SUFFERING NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO INDOOR PAIN. SB THREE OH FIVE WILL GET DYING PATIENTS A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE AND THEIR NUMBER TODAY'S. AND FOR MANY HOPE. WHAT HAPPENED A RHYME BARTEL SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO ANYONE? AGAIN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE PAIN FREE AND THEY'RE DYING DAYS. AND THEY DESERVE TO HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS TO SHARE THEIR FINITE TIME. WITH THEIR LOVED ONES AND THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES. THAT GOAL WITHOUT I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR MY FRIEND FROM SAN DIEGO FOR CHAMPING THIS ISSUE AND I'LL BE VOTING FOR SB. THREE OH FIVE AND ENCOURAGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I WILL BE SURE THAT THIS IS A BIG SWING IN -- PHILOSOPHY FOR ME -- AS I'VE NOT BEEN A PROPONENT OF MEDICAL.

A FRIEND OF ALL OF OURS -- FROM SAN DIEGO [inaudible] AND TOLD THE VERY COMPELLING STORY OF HIS SON'S FINAL DAYS AND WEEKS -- IN THE HOSPITAL AND IN HOSPICE. AND AS A SINNER STONE HAS SPOKEN TO THE SCIENCE OF IT. I'LL JUST SPEAK TO THE BILL. THE BILL IS TIGHTLY WRITTEN -- THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS ON IT THAT I THINK MADE THE BILL MUCH BETTER.

CURRENTLY NOT UNDER THE THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THERE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN. A LANGUAGE THROUGH A FEDERAL HOUSE READ RESOLUTION. PROHIBITING ANY FEDERAL FUNDS TO BE EXPENDING ON PREVENTING ANY STATES FROM AND IMPLEMENTING. THEIR OWN STATE LAWS AUTHORIZING THEUSE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SO AS LONG AS THAT LANGUAGE EXIST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SMALLER FACILITIES IN OUR ENTIRE STATE IS PER PROVIDED A SAFE HARBOR SHOULD THAT CHANGE. THIS BILL. WOULD PRETTY MUCH -- SUSPEND THE SMALL.

CENTER COPIER THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND SENATORS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT. SB SEVEN FORTY FORTY FORTY FOUR WHICH ADDRESSES CALIFORNIA'S DAHLE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS AND THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. NEARLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT AND IT IS ESTIMATED A THIRD OF THOSE ARE LIVING WITH A MALE MENTAL ILLNESS. WE KNOW THAT HAVING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS LIVING AND SHELTERED RECYCLING IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS AND INCARCERATION IS COSTLY TO THE PUBLIC. AND RESULT IN NEEDLESS SUFFERING FOR THE HOMELESS AND THEIR FAMILY. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT LAST FALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE WHICH AUTHORIZES THE STATE TO ISSUE TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN BONDS TO CREATE TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS. RESEARCH SHOWS SUCH HOUSING KEEPS PEOPLE INDOORS REDUCES ILLNESSES AND SUFFERING AND LOWERS PUBLIC COSTS IT'S ALSO A HUMANE AND COMPASSIONATE RESPONSE TO A STATEWIDE CRISIS. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR HELPS FOR FILL THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS BY CLARIFYING IN STREAMLINING THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES LIKE THOSE THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME BONDS ARE. FOR OUR FUNDING N ORDER TO EXPEDITE EXPEDITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. CALIFORNIA VOTERS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WANT PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH. DISORDERS AND ARE HOMELESS TO BE SHELTERED AND CARED FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANY OTHER MEASURE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO COMMEND MY MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I I'M I'M JUST MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT. WE HAVE A HOMELESS PROBLEM. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PROBABLY EXCEEDS OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO ANY ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS WE ALL HAVE IT. CERTAINLY IT'S MORE PREVALENT AND MORE THE URBAN AREAS. AND ONE OF THE REASONS CONTRIBUTING OR HOMELESS CRISIS IS WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF HOUSING ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. AND IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT LOWERING THE PRICE OF A HOUSING WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT SB SIR SEVEN FORTY FOUR IS DOING. WE NEED EITHER STREAMLINED SYKORA. OR ELIMINATE SEEK BUFFER SOME OF THESE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT WILL ALLOW FOR A LOWERING OF THE COSTA HOUSING IT. IN GETTING SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THAT. HAVE TO LIVE IN THEIR CARS WHILE THEY GO TO SCHOOL HARD TO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO VOTE ON THE MEASURE LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST. VOTING TO PUT HIM IN THEIR CARS WHETHER GOING TO SCHOOL HOW ABOUT DOING SOMETHING TO MAKE HOUSING AFFORDABLE SO WE CAN GET THEM OUT OF THEIR CARS. AND INTO HOMES. I THINK INDIAN ACTION BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE FUTURE AND NOT STREAMLINING SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> REALLY ADDRESSING. THE HOMELESS PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO CREATE MORE MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING FORCE ON THE TREETS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE ANYMORE. SO LET'S LEARN BY EXAMPLE LET'S NOT RECREATE THE WHEEL LET'S LET'S PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. BY SICK WAS STREAMLINING OR ELIMINATING SICK BUT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- TO NEST I HEAR IT'S A YES VOTE SB SOME. FORTY FOUR THANK YOU CENTER STERN ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR JACKSON'S THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES ARE IDEA. I WASN'T INTENDING TO RISE BUT IT'S BEEN A FOR YEARS. THE SEQUEL IS THE ENEMY OF EVERYTHING GOOD IN THE STATE AND I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT SHE WAS THE REASON CALIFORNIA DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MIAMI BEACH. AND IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN THERE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. OF THE SICK WAS NOT THE PROBLEM HERE. THE PROBLEM IS LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS THE PROBLEM IS NIMBY ISM THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE THREE AND A HALF MILLION UNITS SHORT. AND THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OURSELVES OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT LANDLORDS BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND NATURE OF HOUSING GET TO CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT. THE PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO DO THINGS LIKE RENT CONTROL. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY EASY TO SORT OF PASTE OVER WITH ALL THE SLOGANS THAT SEEK WAS THE ENEMY WE'VE XPEDITED SEQUEL IN MANY INSTANCES WE'VE STREAMLINED IT IN MANY INSTANCES. I'VE DONE LEGISLATION THAT EXPEDITES THE PROCESS BECAUSE PART OF THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN. THAT IT TAKES SO LONG TO HAVE A SECRET MATTER HEARD THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER TO OUR PROBLEM THOUGH AND IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE EXPEDITED REVIEWS AND YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE OPPOSITION HERE. COMES FROM BOTH THE SIERRA CLUB AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BECAUSE WE HAVE PRIORITIES IN THE STATE WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD. THE COURTS THIS LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE THINGS LIKE OUR SENIORS. HAVE PRIORITY WHEN IT COMES TO CASES BEING FILED WE ALSO HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH HAS PRIORITIES BECAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. TO A SPEEDY TRIAL WE'VE HAD INSTANCES WHERE WE GIVE DISABILITY RIGHTS FOLKS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE SET THAT IS A PRIORITY. WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT HOW WE GO ABOUT THIS AND INSTEAD OF THROWING DOWN THE GAUNTLET THAT SICK WAS THE REASON THAT WE ARE IN THE MASS WE ARE. I THINK WE IF WE ARE TRULY GOING TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS HOUSING PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE STATE WE% NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE REAL CULPRITS ARE. AND I AGAIN OF IT NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER WE DO HAVE DESPERATE NEED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND ELSEWHERE. BUT TRYING TO EVISCERATES SYKORA IS NOT THE SOLUTION WITHOUT AYE ORIGINAL. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER ROCK. THANK YOU. MISTER PRESIDENT I GET MY MIKE WORKING I RISE. TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE -- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN CERTAIN CASES TO EXPEDITE MATTERS WE DO AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS WE DO IN A VARIETY OF OTHER. SITUATIONS AND THIS IS CERTAINLY -- EQUALLY A JUSTIFIED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I WILL TELL YOU THAT I'M. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TOOK A POSITION ON THIS BILL. IN MY OPINION IT'S NOT THEIR JOB TO TELL US WHAT NEEDS TO BE EXPEDITED AND NOT EXPEDITED. THEIR JOB IS TO TELL US WHAT RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GET THE JOB DONE AND I LET THEM KNOW THAT AND HEARING IF THEY COME SEE ME AGAIN I'M GONNA LET HIM KNOW WHAT AGAIN. SO WITH THAT HAVING BEEN SAID I WOULD REQUEST WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. BAKER SAID IRAQ. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER Y. CASKEY MISTER PRESIDENT I WAS IN -- PER. ARE GOING TO GET OUT BUT I VOTED AGAINST THIS. IN THE TWO COMMITTEES IT'S AGAIN AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA SAID IT'S A WHOLE SLEW OF EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE ATTACKING ON THAT THE SECRET PROCESS RATHER THAN GOING IN WITH SOME COMPREHENSIVE REFORM WE LEAVE. TOO MUCH -- DISCRETION UP TO THE LOCAL DECISION MAKERS AND I AM BLESSED BE STAYING OFF THE BILL IN VOTING NOW. THANK YOU SIR BYE CASKEY CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS THE PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. YOU KNOW I AGREE THAT. WE SHOULD AT SOME POINT WE TAKE A BROADER LOOK -- AND HOW WE DO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IN CALIFORNIA AND BRING ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT FOR NOW THE LAW IS WHAT IT IS -- AND WE HAVE A DIRE SITUATION IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE AND WE'RE EITHER COMMITTED -- TO HOUSING THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT OR WE ARE AND WE KNOW FROM THE WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND ITS SEQUEL IS BEING USED TO DELAY. UNTIL SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON OUR STREETS AND DYING ON OUR STREETS. IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW -- WHERE WE HAVE A NAVIGATION CENTER THAT IS THERE ARE THREATENING TO SUE UNDERSEA CAUGHT AND THERE IS NO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE -- WITHOUT PROJECT -- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS HOUSING DELIVERED YESTERDAY AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER BARGES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WASN'T PLANNING ON SPEAKING -- ON THIS -- I WILL -- CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTIVE AND I WANT TO THANK -- THE AUTHOR OF THIS ITEM -- FOR BRING IT FORWARD. I THINK THE COMMENTS THAT WE HEARD TODAY NORMALLY -- I THINK YOU'RE RATIONALLY INFLAME THE PASSIONS. BUT SEE WAT IS -- A A SERIES OF PROTECTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY IN MY EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY THE LOCAL LEVEL. FORMALLY AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER THAN ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAVING LAND USE AUTHORITY I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND EXACTLY HOW SEEK WORK IS NO LONGER USED MOSTLY AS A SHIELD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT INSTEAD AS AN EXTRACTION TOOL AS A SORT. AND I THINK IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT CHANGING OUR HOUSING STOCK IN THIS STATE. GETTING OUT OF THE DEFICIT THAT WERE IN IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND AFFORDABILITY. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ON SOME OF THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS IN ONE OF THOSE IMPEDIMENTS IN MY OPINION I THINK FACTUALLY. IS THAT SEEK WERE CREATES. ARE ARE A SERIES OF ROAD BLOCKS THAT HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE MISUSED BY ADVOCATES FOR OTHER THAN ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS. SO I WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS IN THIS ROOM TO SUPPORT -- THIS -- PROPOSED LEGISLATION -- BECAUSE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO TO KEEP OUR HEAD IN THE SAND IF WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS A HOUSING STOCK. AND WE NEED TO MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE WE NEED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY. AND WE WILL NEVER BE SERIOUS ABOUT ENDING THIS THIS CHALLENGE UNLESS WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE IN -- A A MERITORIOUS LOOK AT HOW SEE WHAT HAS EVOLVED ON IN ITS CURRENT STATE I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU CENTER SENATOR JACKSON'S. I THANK MS PRESS I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE. FROM A RIVERSIDE -- IT. NO MORE OR WE SUPPOSED TO TELL OR IS THE COURTS POST TELL US WHAT TO DO WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL THE COURT HOW TO RUN ITS BUSINESS AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. WHEN YOU TELL THE COURTS THE ONLY A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS WITHIN WHICH TO RULE ON SOMETHING -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS OUR JURISDICTION -- TO TELL THE COURTS HOW TO DO THEIR BUSINESS. IS AND I THINK UNCONSTITUTIONAL A DIRECTIVE TO THE BUT I WILL SAY THIS. IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND ARE JUST TRYING. TO CREATE MORE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE DEVELOPERS LIKE TO BUILD. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE SEQUEL REVIEW. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF CASES THAT ARE RESOLVED? PRIOR TO GOING TO LITIGATION OUR E. WHEN YOU FILE A SEQUEL CLAIM IT'S THERE'S A REQUIREMENT OF MEDIATION. EIGHTY FIVE OR 90% OF THOSE CASES. ARE SETTLED THROUGH THAT MEDIATION PROCESS AND ONLY 2% OF ALL CASES ACTUALLY ARE EVER FILED THE DEAL WITH SEQUEL. SO OF THAT 2% 85% ARE RESOLVED THROUGH THAT MEDI A MEDIATION PROCESS SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF WE REALLY WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM NOT JUST OPEN UP THE STATE. FOR ALL SORTS OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WE CANNOT DEAL WITH. AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT THE HOMELESS AS OF THE ONE CHILD IN FRONT LIKE WE DO WITH WOMEN IN ORPHANS IN WAR. THE PROBLEM REALLY IS. A SITUATION WHERE WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THE DEAL WITH LAND USE AND IF YOU ARE CITY PER OF SOMEONE WHO CAME FROM CITY GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BUILD. WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF HIGH END DEVELOPMENT THAT GOES ON WE AREN'T BUILDING APARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PROFITABLE LET'S TAKE A LOOK? AT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO BUILD MORE HIGH DENSITY HOUSING AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL OF THE ENVIRONMENT MY LAST POINT THAT IF I MAY. MISTER PRESIDENT MAKE IT IS THAT PART OF THE DEAL WITH SEQUEL IS THERE IS ONLY ONE RECOURSE. AND THAT IS THROUGH THE COURTS. WE DON'T HAVE A DEPARTMENT THAT WE CAN GO TO FIRST THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE PROCESS WE DO. IF WE REALLY CARE ABOUT REDUCING THE TIME FRAME AND GETTING RESOLUTION TO THESE MATTERS. THEN WE WILL DO MEDIATION THROUGH THE COURTS WHERE ALMOST EVERY CASE IS SETTLED SEQUENCE IS NOT OUR ENEMY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR JACKSON CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TO WASN'T AS SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE AND TELL I THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN MY% OWN DISTRICT AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN SANTA BARBARA THAT THERE IS MORE THAN SEQUEL ISSUES. THAT -- AFFECT OUR HOUSING COSTS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WITH THE REGULATION REGULATIONS THAT ARE PUT ON HOUSING COSTS. ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PERMITS FEES AND THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE APPLIED FOR BEFORE YOU EVEN PICTURE FIRST A SHOVEL IN THE GROUND ON HOUSING. AND THOSE ARE THE LAWS AND THINGS THAT WE'VE PASSED IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT OF IMPOSE THESE THINGS ON OUR BUILDERS THAT ARE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I DO HAVE TO COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES BOTH FROM THE VALLEY AND FROM AND AS THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA. AND THE IT IS TRUE THAT SECRET IS A DETERRENT AND AN EXTORTION OR EXTRACTION MECHANISM THAT IS NOT DEALT DOES NOT DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ALONE. I CAN TELL YOU A STORY OF A OF AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT THAT WE WERE DOING AND TAFT CALIFORNIA A RULE AREA. BUT THERE WAS THIS PARTICULAR TYPE A SQUIRREL THAT WAS THERE IT TOOK HIM SEVEN YEARS TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS HE HAD TO TRAP THE SQUIRREL CAPTIONS WORLD. TRACK IT DO REPORT SENATE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME AND IT JUST WENT ON AND ON AND ON SEVEN YEARS LATER THERE WAS FINALLY RESOLUTION BUT THERE WAS AN EXTRACTION COSTS THAT HE HAD TO PAY. TO ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION IN ORDER TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY OUTSIDE IN MY RULE AREA OF MY DISTRICT. AND SO IT'S JUST -- NOT WRITE THAT SEQUEL IS BEING USED FOR A TOOL FOR THAT I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN AT LEAST STREAMLINED A PROCESS THAT WE DON'T HAVE SEVEN FORD IN. ELEVEN YEAR DELAYS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO THE HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP HOUSING -- MOST SO THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR GROW SENATOR ALSO. YES I JUST A ALSO WAS NOT GOING TO SPEAK BUT I'D LIKE TO SAY. TO THE SENATOR FROM FRESNO THAT YOU CAME ABOUT THIS CLOSE TO CONVINCE ME TO VOTE AGAINST THIS -- I HAD MADE A COMMITMENT BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFIC USE. AND BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFIC NEED. THAT THAT COMMUNITY ARE PART OF THAT. THAT PART OF OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS -- AND IF I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO BE USED AS A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS. SO -- I REALLY -- JUST TO LOOK AT THIS IN THE PIECE THAT IT IS AND IF THIS IS A VOTE ON SEE CA THEN I'M AGAINST IT. IT'S A VOTE AS THE WAY IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED HERE THAT I'M FOR IT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RAZA SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR STARTING THIS DEBATE -- JUST DAY EVER GONNA THROW STATISTICS AROUND. THE REAL TRAGEDY ABOUT SEA QUEST. SINCE FOR ON THIS SUBJECT IS THAT 50% OF THE LAWSUITS ARE ACTUALLY AGAINST GOVERNMENTS. SO IT'S USUALLY THE TAXPAYERS THAT. HAVE TO PAY THE COST -- AND THE PLAINTIFFS ARE USUALLY EUPHEMISMS THERE THEY DON'T EVEN TELL YOU WHO THEY ARE THEY'RE USUALLY THEY HIDE BEHIND NAMES LIKE. CITIZENS FOR A GOOD CAUSE. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IT IS IT'S ALL YOU KNOW LOVE LOVE THIS AND AND AND SWEETNESS AND LIGHT BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S USUALLY GREEN MAIL IT'S USUALLY UNIONS TRYING TO UPSET THE APPLE CART TO EXTRACT MORE IN THEIR JOBS BUT YOU SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW WHO YOU'RE BEING SUED BY YOU SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW YOUR ACCUSER. AND FACE YOUR ACCUSER THERE'S NO TRANSPARENCY AND SEE SINCE MISTER PRESIDENT YOU BROCK YOU BROUGHT UP SEEK WHAT. SO I I JUST SAID I THINK IT'S ABSURD THAT WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE TO DISCLOSE EVERY DONOR THAT CONTRIBUTES TO OUR CAMPAIGNS ABOVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT. AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO DO WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT WE HAVE FULL TRANSPARENCY FULL DISCLOSURE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S SUING YOU UNTIL THE CASE IS CONCLUDED. IN SECRET THAT THAT THAT'S AN ABUSE THAT HAS TO STOP. SO MISTER PRESIDENT IS SOMEONE WHO HELPED PUT PROPOSITION TWO ON THE BALLOT. AND HELP GET -- NO PLACE LIKE HOME MOVING FROM THE GET GO WITH. FORMER SENATOR KEVIN DELEON -- I SUPPORT SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR MORE LIKE CENTER STONE. THANKS AGAIN MISTER. PRESIDENT I'D AND IMPLEMENT SPEAKING TWICE BUT I FIGURED WHY NOT I THINK IT'S VERY HEALTHY WHEN WE GET INTO THESE DEBATES ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND FRANKLY WE SHOULD WE SHOULD DO IT. MORE OFTEN BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO BRING SOME OF THESE ISSUES TO THE FOREFRONT AND AND HAVE A REALISTIC DISCUSSIONS ON THEM. YEAH I I GREATLY RESPECT MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA AND I KNOW SHE'S VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT -- ABOUT SEQUEL -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU'LL VILIFY DEVELOPERS THAT OUR OUR CAPITALISTIC PROVIDING HOUSING AND MY GOODNESS ARE CERTAINLY ENTITLED TO MAKE A PROFIT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT LEAST STILL TODAY OUR IS MUCH IS SEASON THROUGH THE ASK ABOUT SEE WHAT. I'M NOT REAL EXCITED ABOUT SEE WHAT NOT BECAUSE I'M NOT WANTING CLEAN WATER AND CLEAN AIR. ALL REMIND THIS BODY IT WAS A REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION THAT ACTUALLY BROUGHT SEEK WERE TO FRUITION. BUT THERE ARE MANY UNFORTUNATE LOOPHOLES AND SEE QUIRK. THAT MAKE IT VERY UNFAIR. I THINK IT'S VERY UNFAIR. THAT YOU CAN BE A PLAINTIFF IN STILL PROJECT A HOUSING PROJECT AS AN EXAMPLE [inaudible] UNDER A FALSE PRETENSE OF HURTING THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IF YOU LOSE THAT LAWSUIT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE OTHER SIDE'S LEGAL FEES BUT IF YOU PREVAIL IN THAT LAWSUIT. YOU HAVE TO YOU GET YOUR ATTORNEY FEES PAID THAT TO ME IS AN INJUSTICE. OF JUSTICE. MY COLLEAGUES HAS ONLY 2% OF THE CASES MAKE IT TO COURT. BECAUSE IT'S ALL SETTLED THROUGH MEDIATION REFERENCES NOT MEDIATION. I CALLED EXTORTION. THEY EXTORT DEVELOPERS EXTORT GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN OPEN CHECK. ESPECIALLY FROM GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE DEEP POCKETS AND THIS IS WHY WE DON'T SEE. THE GROWTH OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKETS THE GROWTH OF OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL GROWTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE WILLING. TO RISK TAKE A RISK IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU HAVE A CLOUD OF SYKORA? OVER THEM THEY'RE NOT GOING-[inaudible] TO TAKE ARREST HOW GIVEN EXAMPLE THE CITY OF MENIFEE BEFORE THE CITY I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE NEED TO APPROVE A LARGE SHOPPING CENTER THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE FINANCIAL BASE. FOR THEM TO BECOME A CITY. THE DEVELOPER WENT THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS SEES THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS SEASON ERA ARE. THEY GOT LEASES CIVIC APPROVED TO THE BANK THEY GET FROM THE PROJECT AND AT THE LAST MINUTE. A CITIZEN FROM TEMECULA A CASHIER. AT A LOCAL STORE ONE PERSON BECAME THE CONCERNED CITIZENS FOR MENIFEE A CITY SHE DIDN'T EVEN LIVE IN. FOR THE AREA MENIFEE. AND THROUGH THAT SICK WILL LAWSUIT THEY STOPPED THAT PROJECT COLDER THEIR RISK OF LOSING THEIR TENANTS THERE A LIST OF LOSING THE REVENUE FOR THE THE LEASE OBLIGATIONS IN THEIR RISK OF THE SHOPPING CENTER GOING DOWN. AND THE UNFORTUNATE THING WAS THEY ARE AT RISK OF NOT BECOMING A CITY THEY WANTED LOCAL CONTROL THE FACT OF THE PUTTING TOGETHER THEIR OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK THEY WANTED TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE COUNTY [inaudible] SO [inaudible] THIS BILL. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR IS A GOOD BILL. BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH A MECHANISM THE INITIATIVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS A COULD BE SPENT. AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS TO GET THESE AFFORDABLE UNITS ON THE BOOKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE MAYBE WE CAN GET SOME OF THESE. UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE AYE COLUMN THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE AND LET'S GET THEM INTO HOMES AND LET'S GET THEM INTO THE SERVICES THAT IT DESPERATELY NEEDS IT'S BILLS LIKE THIS. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MOVE HOUSING INTO OUR MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA QUICKER -- RATHER THAN DELAYING THE PROCESS AS SEQUEL OFTEN DOES FOR THOSE REASONS AGAIN I REGION OF A YES VOTE SB. SEVEN FORTY FOUR THANK YOU CENTER STONE. CENTER ALLEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO WEIGH IN. YES I JUST WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS FROM THE CENTER FROM US ANDERSON DORADO -- IT THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON ONE PARTICULAR PART OF OUR CURRENT CRISIS REALLY PROMISE FOR HOUSING AND AND IT'S NARROW.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION. AND IN IN I REALLY APPRECIATE -- I EXPECT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A COUPLE MORE DISCUSSIONS -- ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF SECRET BUT BUT FRANKLY ON THIS IS A A MUCH NARROWER BILL -- WE GOT OUT A LITTLE BIT OFF TOP TOPIC TOP TALKING ABOUT -- IT PERSONAL OPINIONS ON ON SEQUENCE AND IT'S IT'S IT'S GOODNESS ARE OR IT'S NOT. THIS BILL IS VERY VERY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED IT'S PATTERNED AFTER EXISTING STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND WHAT THIS LAW DOES WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS IT SAYS WE ARE GOING TO INCLUDE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AS PART OF THE FRAMEWORK. FOR ALLOWING SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED IN MULTI HOUSING DEVELOPMENT M. WHERE THE IT'S IT'S BEEN ZONE BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. IT DID FITS IN WITHIN THEIR PLAN BUT NOW SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS PART OF THE PROCESS AS WELL AND WHAT IT DOES IS -- IT DOES NOT EVISCERATES SEQUOIA. SIX WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN CONDUCTED IN THESE ZONES. ALL IT DOES IS GIVE IT PREFERENCE. IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN GET THESE UNITS. PLANNED AND BUILT. AN EXPEDITED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO IT DOESN'T GIVE A PASS TO SYKORA IT JUST REQUIRES THAT THERE BE AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS. WHICH BY THE WAY WE DO ALL THE TIME. WE DO IT IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INSTANCES SO -- THIS THIS PARTICULAR -- FRAMEWORK WHICH PASSED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BY BY THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE OF THE NIMBIS AND THE IDEA WAS TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE MULTI. FAMILY HOUSING UNITS UP IDENTIFIED BUILT -- AND AND THEY HAVE AN EXPEDITED PROCESS SO.

ONE EIGHTY EIGHT CENTER LEYVA MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR BY SENATOR LEYVA AND ACTING TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND MAKING A PREPARATION THERE. FOR CENTER LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THE US SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION. PROVIDES A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT PROTECTS A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT LANDMARK CASE WAS ROE V. WADE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE NOW ALMOST HALF A CENTURY LATER. PEOPLE GROUPS AN INSTITUTION. HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN THINK OF TO RESTRICT ACCESS AND A SHAME ANY WOMAN WHO CHOOSES TO HAVE AN ABORTION. THE OUR FORMER GOVERNOR MAY HAVE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT UNREASONABLE FOR A COLLEGE STUDENT TO TRAVEL OFF CAMPUS TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION. I RESPECTFULLY AND PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE. MEMBERS JUST THREE YEARS AGO A GROUP OF COMMITTED UC BERKELEY STUDENTS STARTED A GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO BRING MEDICATION ABORTION TO THEIR ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CARE. AFTER SPEAKING TO THEIR ADMINISTRATION AND RAISING SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO THAT END THEY WERE STILL REJECTED BY SCHOOL LEADERS AT WHICH POINT I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE THE EFFORT HERE IN THE CAPITAL. SB TWENTY FOUR IS THE CONTINUATION OF THAT EFFORT. THE COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHT TO ACCESS ACT WOULD REQUIRE ALL ON CAMPUS SOON HEALTH CENTERS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO PROVIDE MEDICATION FOR EARLY PREGNANCY TERMINATION FOR THEIR STUDENTS BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE RESEARCH FROM UC SAN FRANCISCO ESTIMATES THAT EVERY MONTH. FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN STUDENTS AT THE THIRTY FOUR UC AND CSU CAMPUSES SEEK MEDICATION ABORTIONS ARE OFFSITE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. CLEARLY IF WE TRULY VALUE TO ACCESS TO ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING STUDENT SUCCESS IT IS. CRITICAL THAT THESE HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS EVERY MONTH ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE SERVICES. ON CAMPUS MEDICATION ABORTION IS A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE A PATIENT TAKES TWO SETS OF PILLS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS. DURING THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY ACCORDING TO A UC SAN FRANCISCO STUDY MEDICATION ABORTION IS VERY SAFE WITH MAJOR COMPLICATIONS OCCURRING IN ONLY ZERO POINT 3% OF CASES. MAKING IT SAFER THAN TYLENOL. AND THE EVER AVAILABLE ****. THOUGH MANY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SUCH AS PREGNANCY OPTIONS COUNSELING AND CONTRACEPTIVES NONE CURRENTLY OFFER ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS. MEDICATION ABORTION IS A SAFE PROCEDURE AND IS CLINICALLY SIMPLER THAN MUCH OF THE CARE ALREADY OFFERED A COLLEGE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. SUCH AS DIABETES MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. ACCESS IS SEVERELY LIMITED FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS SINCE ONLY 15%. OF THE CLOSEST OFF CAMPUS ABORTION PROVIDERS ARE OPEN ON WEEKENDS MEETING THAT STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO MISS CLASS EXAMS AND WORK TO ACCESSIBLE OCEAN WHICH IS SUPREME COURT AS DETERMINED TO BE A PROTECTED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS CRITICAL SINCE WERE MUST RECEIVE THIS CARE WITHIN THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. AND MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE PREGNANT UNTIL THEY ARE FIVE OR SIX WEEKS ALONG. MEMBERS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS NOT JUST A SLOGAN BUT RATHER A COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING TRUE ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS OUR STATE. INCLUDING COLLEGE STUDENTS AT OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND AND COLLEAGUES THE ONE THING I LOVE ABOUT THE THE SENATORS THAT WERE VERY COLLEGIAN BODY WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE ON ISSUES AND WALK OFF THE FLOOR AND STILL. BE FRIENDS WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND I CERTAINLY RESPECT MY MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM CHINO HILLS -- BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND I'M NOT. ON THE FLOOR HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF ROE VERSUS WADE THE THE LEGALITY OF OF GETTING AN ABORTION I'M HERE. STRICTLY TALK ABOUT THE THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TYPE OF AN ABORTION. HEALTH. I BELIEVE THAT CHEMICAL ABORTIONS IN A MANNER THAT'S BEING ADMINISTERED JEOPARDIZES THE HEALTH OF MANY OF OUR YOUNG WOMEN. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A PHARMACIST NOW FOR ALMOST FOUR DECADES THIRTY SEVEN YEARS IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE MYSELF. I NOT ONLY PRACTICE PHARMACY OF ACTUALLY TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL PHARMACOLOGY. AND IT'S IN THIS SIX IT'S THIS EXPERIENCE THAT MAKES ME SO WEARY. OF PHARMACEUTICAL ABORTION. SINCE MIFEPRISTONE WAS APPROVED IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND BY THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION. THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND CASES WERE EXTREME REACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED THIS INCLUDES. MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED. THEIR BENTLEYS FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE BLOOD LOSS SO SEVERE. THAT THEY NEED BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS. THURMOND AT LEAST TWENTY TWO DESK DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE. TO THE DRUG. IN ADDITION ABORTION IS A HIGHLY PERSONAL DECISION. THAT MUST BE MADE BY WOMAN. AND THERE IS AMPLE AVAILABILITY TO ABORTION OPTIONS THROUGH THE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD THE MINUTE YOU STAND UP FOR AND SUPPORT. AND QUALIFIED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS OFTEN. IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE UNIVERSITY. AND THAT'S NOT BY. BY CHANCE. HAVING CAMPUSES PROVIDE THE ABORTION PILL GIVES THIS FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. THE YOUNG COLLEGE WOMEN SEEKING ABORTION THIS IS A MATTER OF TAKING MEDICATION A COUPLE DAYS IN A ROW. IN YOUR PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED. AND YOU CAN GO ON AND CONTINUE YOUR STUDIES. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WOMEN IN OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES NEEDS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AND GIVEN THEM A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY WITH AN EASY FIX TO THEIR ABORTION NEEDS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A WISE COURSE OF ACTION. WHEN THE ABORTION PILL DOESN'T WORK FOR THE FIRST TIME? THE WOMAN USUALLY DOESN'T REALIZE IT IT TAKES TIME. THIS OFTEN RESULTS IN A SURGICAL ABORTION BEING REQUIRED IN THE REST OF THE MOTHER A MUCH GREATER SENSE THE TIME LAPSE BETWEEN -- TAKING THE PILL AND THE SURGICAL ABORTION IS ALLOW THE BABY TO MATURE. TO A GREATER EXTENT. THIS MEANS THAT THE ABORTION WILL TAKE PLACE AT A LATER DATE. WHICH INCREASES COMPLICATIONS TO THE MOTHER SAYS THE BABY IS MORE FULLY GROWN. THE MEDICAL ABORTION IS SO MUCH MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THERE IS NO INTERACTION WITH THE DOCTOR. DURING THE DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE. THIS BILL NEEDLESSLY WRESTLER WIVES OF YOUNG WOMEN. THEY DESERVE TO GO TO A BONAFIDE CLINIC. BE SEEN BY A BONAFIDE POSITION AND GET THE CONCENTRATED COMPREHENSIVE CARE. THAT THEY NEED ESPECIALLY THOSE CASES WEATHER'S ADVERSE REACTIONS. THIS BILL REST A STATE FINANCES DUE TO THE EXTREME LOSSES OVER LIABILITY ISSUES WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG. OF GUARANTEE YOU WE WILL SEE THAT PLAINTIFF IN A COURT OF LAW SAYING I DESERVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. I WOULD URGE MEMBERS TO STOP THIS DANGEROUS BILL BEFORE YOU HEARD ARE VULNERABLE YOUNG WOMAN. FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. YES THANK YOU I MISTER PRESIDENT PRESIDENT. MEMBERS -- TODAY I RISE IN OPPOSITION SB -- TWENTY FOUR THIS BILL. IS A IT IS A MANDATE ON STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. WITHOUT ALSO ENSURING THAT THEY CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF WOMEN. WHO MAY WANT TO KEEP YOUR CHILDREN? THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE TO SIX SUGGEST THAT A STUDENT WANTING ABORTION ALREADY HAS AMPLE ACCESS WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THE SCHOOL. BUT ALSO -- FURTHER WE SHOULD NOT BE PROMOTING THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS TO PROVIDE ABORTIONS I KNOW THAT THERE IS A FINE. THAT WILL BE SERVED BY PRIVATE -- SOURCES BUT ALSO THE STATE WILL STILL BE ON THE COSTS FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE LANGUAGE ALLOWS LOCAL AND FEDERAL -- AND TAXPAYER PUBLIC FUNDING. AND SO SB TWENTY FOUR WILL ONLY PLACE MORE BURDENS ON STUDENT HEALTH CLINICS THAT SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDING SUCH SENSITIVE SERVICES SO. I THINK WE'RE ONLY OFFERING ONE SOLUTION WHICH IS ABORTION AND WE COULD BE OFFERING EIGHT FOR WOMEN WHO -- WOULD PREFER TO KEEP THEIR NEWBORN BABIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN -- APPRECIATE IN A VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SAID A MORALE CENTER PAN. I THANK YOU. THE PRESIDENT -- SENATORS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND CERTAINLY AS A PHYSICIAN -- OF AND NOW I'M A PEDIATRICIAN I'VE COULD ALSO CONSULT WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT SAID JACKSON GYNECOLOGY AND THEY HAVE EXPRESSED TO ME AND THAT TO THEY ARE -- IN IN THAT THEY FEEL THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY WOULD BE A VERY SAFE APPROACH -- I THINK OUR STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS -- WHICH ARE OFTEN IF IT'S OUR STAFFS -- PHYSICIANS ON STAFF THAT THERE THAT DAY -- CAN PROVIDE THIS CARE IN A IN A SAFE MANNER. AND THE I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE DO HAVE AN ACCESS PROBLEM SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT DISTANCES AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK IF ANY OF US. REMEMBER BACK TO OUR COLLEGE DAYS -- THAT -- YOU KNOW GET GETTING OFF CAMPUS IS NOT ALWAYS THAT EASY I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN TRY AND PEOPLE CAN DO IT BUT WE WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE FOR SURE THAT WE PROVIDE FOR IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A LEGAL. LEGAL HEALTH SERVICE -- THAT IS -- CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH OF A GROUP OF STUDENTS ON CAMPUS AND THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AND SO -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE ALSO IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE -- BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT -- THE HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS AND THAT INCLUDES TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED AND IT WILL BE DONE SAFELY AND IT WILL BE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS WHO NEED TO HAVE IT I SPEAK AND I ASK THAT WE FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER PAN. SEEING NO OTHER MIKE'S UP. THERE LEYVA YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO START WITH SOME OF THE INACCURACIES THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM CONNECT TO MACULA STATED. BUT I THINK WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO SAY IS THAT. WHEN I GOT ELECTED WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE I RAN FOR OFFICE BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS HAD A GOOD JOB THAT THEY HAD BENEFITS THEY HAD A PENSION? AND THEN. VERY SOON AFTER I WAS ELECTED I REALIZE THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK STILL IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE HEAR ABOUT ALL THE TIME WITH PAY EQUITY. WE HEAR ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT STILL HAPPENS DAILY. AND NOW SOMETHING THAT WAS DECIDED. A HALF A CENTURY AGO WE SEE ATTACKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT WOMEN SHOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. I'M NOT ASKING ANYONE TO HAVE AN ABORTION BUT I'M SAYING EVERY WOMAN WHO NEEDS OR WANTS ONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS. AND I STRONGLY DISAGREE THAT THE WOMEN ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS AND YOU IT THE INTERESTING THING. IS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE SAID TO ME THAT THEY FELT THAT WOMEN HAVE ACCESS OR ALL WHITE MEN. SO I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE EVER TRIED TO ACCESS AN ABORTION SO THEY PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND FOR MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MEDICATED ABORTION NOT CLICK CHEMICAL ABORTION MEDICATED ABORTION BEING DANGEROUS WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR DO YOU THINK WOMEN SHOULD HAVE A SURGICAL ABORTION WHICH PROVIDE THAT ON CAMPUS. NOTHING IS PERFECT BUT MEDICATED ABORTION HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE SAFE AND I WILL. I JUST CONTINUE TO BE SHOCKED THAT AT FIFTY TWO YEARS OLD I HAVE TO FIGHT FOR WOMEN COMING UP BEHIND ME AND WOMEN STANDING BESIDE ME. TO HAVE ACCESS THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION AND THIS STARTED FROM OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE UNIVERSITY BERKELEY STUDENTS OUR FUTURE WHO WANT THIS IN ISN'T IT OUR JOB TO TRY AND HELP THEM. SO MEMBERS WELL WE SEE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ROLL BACKS ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS BECAUSE REALLY NOT HAVING ACCESS TO AN ABORTION. IS JUST A CONTROL ISSUE IS AND IT IS JUST TELLING WOMEN WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO WITH THEIR BODY. IT'S NO ONE'S JOB TO DO THAT AND NO ONE'S DECISION EXCEPT FOR THE WOMAN SO LET'S STOP CONTROLLING MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEMSELVES. AND THEIR FAMILIES MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR LEYVA MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN [inaudible] HI ARCHULETA. AYE ATKINS AYE BATES. BELL.

WHO LIVED IN THE LA BASIN IN THE SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES OR IF YOU'VE SEEN THE PHOTOS? YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD HARDLY SEE THE MOUNTAINS SHE COULDN'T SEE THE OCEAN. THEY WERE IN A HAZE OF SMART. MUCH OF THAT WAS FROM PARTICULATE MATTER. SO WHILE WE'VE DONE MUCH BETTER UNFORTUNATELY DIESEL POWERED VEHICLES FOSSIL FUEL DIESEL POWERED VEHICLES ARE STILL ONE OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF THAT PARTICULATE MATTER WHICH IS SO HEALTH DAMAGING. IN WHICH IS NOW. WE HAVE DATA TO SHOW THAT IT IS IN. ASSISTING IN OUR INCREASED ASTHMA RATES IN VARIOUS CARDIO PULMONARY PROBLEMS ADDITIONALLY. WHAT SB FORTY FOUR DOES IS DIRECTOR AIR RESOURCES BOARD? TO HELP ESTABLISH A PLAN THAT WOULD ASSIST US IN MOVING OUR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. OFF OF THAT. VERY HIGH PARTICULATE MATTER FUEL -- WE'VE GOT A LAW DEGREE PROGRAMS FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES BUT FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE ROAD NEAR PORTS OR IN THE TRUCK GOODS MOVEMENT CORRIDORS. THEY ARE. SUFFERING SEVERELY FROM THIS MARKET THAT COMES FROM SO MANY OF THOSE TRUCKS. THAT ARE POWERED BY THE FOSSIL FUEL DIESEL. WE COULD ASSIST THOSE TRUCK OWNERS NOW THAT THERE ARE SO MANY NEW VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS. THE STATE CAN ASSESS. TRUCKS TO USE A CLEANER TO EITHER CHANGE THEIR TECHNOLOGY OR CHANGE THEIR FUEL AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SAID ABOUT FORTY NUMBER SENATOR SKINNER AN ACRYLATE ENERGY. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND A MEMBER SO. WE ALL HAVE THESE VARIATION SAY WE ALL BUT BUT PRETTYMUCH ALL OF US HAVE THE SMART PHONES AND NOW. OUR HOUSES ARE EQUIPPED WITH THINGS LIKE -- THERMOMETERS THAT SAID ARE EITHER ARE ABC'S OR HEATING SYSTEM THAT CAN BE THEN CONTROLLED THROUGH OUR THROUGH ABSENT OR SMARTPHONES. WE ALSO HAVE -- THEORIES TO POINTS IS THAT WE CAN TURN OFF AND ON THROUGH THE APPS IN OUR SMART PHONES. THAT'S A GREAT THING BECAUSE YOU CAN HELP US LIKE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR HOME IS COOL DOWN BEFORE WE GET HOME MORE WARM BEFORE WE GET HOME WE CAN USE THAT SMARTPHONE AND DO THAT HAPPENED CONTROL THOSE DEVICES. TO DATE. OUR ENERGY COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO HELP BRING US VERY ENERGY EFFICIENT APPLIANCES WHICH IS GREAT AND DUE TO THAT WE ARE CALIFORNIA'S PLANTS IS ARE THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT IN THE U. S.. AND IT'S HELPED US KEEP OUR PER CAPITA ELECTRICITY USE THE SAME SINCE THE NIGHT LIKE. NINETEEN EIGHTY NOW WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ALLOW THE CVC TO ALSO. ENCOURAGE APPLIANCES TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THESE APPS IN OTHER WORDS THAT ARE POINTS IS BE SMART. SO THAT WE CAN USE THEM TO ASSIST IN MANAGING THE DEMAND OF OUR ELECTRICITY. RIGHT NOW THE ENERGY COMMISSION CAN ONLY. INVOLVED THEMSELVES AROUND APPLIANCES ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ALONE IN NOT IN DEMAND MANAGEMENT WHICH COULD SO HELP US IT HELPS CONSUMERS POTENTIALLY REDUCE YOUR UTILITY BILL. BECAUSE BY HAVING A SMART APPLIANCE IN YOUR APP YOU COULD JUST THE HOW MUCH DATA POINTS IS DRAWING DURING THE TIMES WHEN OUR UTILITY RATES ARE HIGHEST. SO IT MAKES GREAT SENSE FOR CONSUMERS TO HELP THEM KEEP THEIR BILLS DOWN BUT IT ALSO MAKES GREAT SENSE AS WE TRY TO MANAGE OUR GRID ELECTRICITY.

TEN FORTY FIVE CAN BE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES SB FORTY SETS CLEAR STANDARDS FOR INITIATING A CONSERVATORSHIP. RENEWING A CONSERVATORSHIP AND FOR ENDING THE CONSERVATORSHIP UNDER THE PROGRAM. BY THE BILL REDUCES THE DURATION OF THE CONSERVATORSHIP FROM ONE YEAR TO SIX MONTHS IT REQUIRES THE PROACTIVE NOTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL CONSERVATIVES. OF THEIR POTENTIAL ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CONSERVATORSHIP PROGRAM -- AFTER A SEVEN FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND TO BE CLEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS CONSERVATORSHIP YOU HAVE TO BE FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT TIMES. IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. BY THE BILL REQUIRES PARTICIPATING COUNTIES TO MAKE CONCERTED EFFORTS TO EMPLOYEE VOLUNTARY SERVICES -- BEFORE SEEKING A CONSERVATORSHIP IT ALSO CLARIFIES THE LEGAL PROCESS FOR CONSIDERING THE USE OF ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. AND DETERMINING IT'S A PUT LEGAL CLICK ABILITY ABILITY TO POTENTIAL CONSERVATIVES. LASTLY RECENT AMENDMENTS REQUIRE THE CONSERVATIVES. CONSERVATIVES OFFICE THIS IMAGE STATUS REPORTS OF EACH CONSERVANCY TO THE CORE EVERY SIXTY DAYS. IN ORDER TO CONSIDER POTENTIALLY TERMINATING THE CONSERVATORSHIP EARLIER -- COLLEAGUES I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS PILOT PROGRAM -- CONSERVATORSHIP AS A LAST RESORT -- THIS PROGRAM IS FOR PEOPLE FOR WHOM VOLUNTARY SERVICE OFFERING OR OFFERING VOLUNTARY SERVICES HAS NOT WORKED PEOPLE WHO ARE SO DETERIORATED AND DYING ON OUR STREETS THAT THEY NEED EXTRA HELP.
