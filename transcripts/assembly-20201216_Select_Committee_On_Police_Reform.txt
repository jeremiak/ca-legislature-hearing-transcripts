EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES IN TRAINING WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW WHAT WE COULD DO IN THE FUTURE. IN REALLY- TAKE THAT IN WITH AN EYE TOWARDS EQUITY AS WELL WE KNOW AT LEAST OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE WANT OUR OFFICERS TO COME FROM OUR COMMUNITIES. TO COME FROM CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE STATE- THAT MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLEGE OR OR WE DON'T WANT THEM TO WAIT TOO LONG- BE TOO OLD SO WE HAVE TO. BALANCE OUT- WHAT HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN COMMUNITIES- THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO GO THE COLLEGE ROUTE SO. I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW WE CAN I'M KIND MERE THOSE TWO THINGS THE TRAINING AS WELL AS A CAREER OPPORTUNITY- FOR LOCAL. INDIVIDUALS WHO REALLY DO WANT TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BEST OFFICERS THOSE PEOPLE COME FROM THE COMMUNITY AND CONTINUE TO SERVE THERE.

MENTIONED IN OUR PREVIOUS GATHERING THAT THE LAW ENFORCERS JUST WANTS TO BE AN EXTENSION OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND- UNFORTUNATELY OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT ALIENATION HAS BECOME A VERY HURTFUL DISTANCE AND SO WE NEED TO CLOSE THAT GAP AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A CRAFTING POLICY THAT.

I'M SIERRA T. OF LEGAL PUNISHMENTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY ACCESS RIGHT IN PRINCIPLE NUMBER SEVEN.

ALTHOUGH THE APPEALS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN BE CRITICS ASK OUR HISTORICAL ALL LIMITED IN THE CURRENT STOCK FOR RACIAL INJUSTICE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES. A CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS UP THE PRINCIPLES WE FIND THAT THEY RESULTED FROM SIMILAR HORAN'S US CIRCUMSTANCES OF HISTORIC CHANGES AND TRANSFORMATIONS RESISTANCE INCREASING INEQUALITIES. HENCE IT COULD SERVE AS A USEFUL LET THANKS FOR THINKING OF THE WHAT ARE CALLED THE FIVE CRITICAL PIECE. OF ANY POLICE REFORM. POLICY WHY POORLY WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF. AS WE BE SHOULDN'T POLICE PROCEDURES HOW DO WE ENFORCE ALL CORRECTED IN KEEPING WITH THAT MISSION ON. HOW DO WE ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY TO PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. ACCESS THIS.

IN CONCLUSION THE PROBLEM OFFICE LISTING OPTIMIZED DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY BENEFITS FROM GLOBAL THINKING IN LOCAL APPLICATIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CONDITIONS ARE SAME OR EQUIVALENT. WOW RACIALIZED POLICING IS THE UNIQUE EURAMERICA PROBLEM OKAY LEGACY OF RACISM ANTI BLACKNESS. POLICE BRUTALITY WHETHER FORMAL OR INFORMAL IT'S MORE OF AN ISSUE OF POWER IMBALANCE I'M VULNERABILITY IN ALL CULTURES AND COUNTRIES.

THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR LOUSY- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY REALLY APPRECIATES YOUR ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE ON- THE NINE PRINCIPLES OF POLICING THANK YOU VERY MUCH RECEIVED A LOT FROM THAT. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A WAIT LET THE MEMBERS KNOW THAT AFTER THESE PRESENTATIONS- WE WILL HAVE NO Q. AND A DURING THIS SEGMENT- BUT THE FOLLOWING PRESENTATIONS WE WILL HAVE Q. AND A- THIS IS INFORMATION AND TO HELP BRING US UP TO DATE IN TERMS OF THE NINE PRINCIPLES OF POLICING SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. I WANT TO INTRODUCE WHO WILL BE WHO WAS IN THE MEETING ROOM PHYSICALLY MISS TANYA FAISON- WHO WILL PROVIDE HER TESTIMONY HER PERSPECTIVE IN THIS AREA. SO PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND THANK YOU YES PLEASE ENTITIES OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE- AND YOU HAVE EIGHT MINUTES AS WELL THANK YOU. CAN WE CUT OUR MICROPHONE ON OR DO I.

THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITH US MISS MAYES ALL NO PROBLEM CAN YOU HEAR ME THAT WE CAN HERE WELL THANK YOU FOR IT PLEASE PROCEED OKAY CELL GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE IN THE SPACE TODAY- I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE MY DISCOMFORT AND RELYING ON- AN EXAMPLE OF A MAN THAT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED TRAUMA FROM POLICE VIOLENCE. AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE USING AS POLICE STANDARDS- I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMUNITY SHOULD BE THE COMMUNITY THAT'S MOST IMPACTED SHOULD LEAD THIS BUT HE DID SAY SOME GOOD THINGS SO I WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE STATEMENTS THAT HE MADE- THE SECOND THING THAT I WANT TO STATE TO IS THAT I AM AN ABOLITIONIST AND WHILE I'M AWARE THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT GONNA CHANGE OVERNIGHT AND- WE DO NEED TO HAVE REFORMS THAT ARE IN PLACE AND IT'S HARD TO BREATHE AT THIS ON- THE REFORMS NEED TO LEAN INTO COMMUNITY. AND SO WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN THEY NEED TO PUT COMMUNITY ON A PEDESTAL. THEY NEED TO- HAVE COMMUNITY OVERSEEING EVERYTHING AND- THEY NEED TO BE- THE DAY COMMUTING TO BE LEADING IN THE DETERMINANT FACTOR. THESE ARE THE KIND OF REFORMS THAT ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED. NOT IN RESPONSE TO THE POLICING PRINCIPLES BY SIR ROBERT PEEL I'M GOING TO PROVIDE MORE CONTEXT TO CONTEXT ON BEHALF OF THE MOST IMPACTED. IN REGARDS TO THE STATE OF POLICING AS IT IS TODAY. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS SO WE HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR POLICE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT IT IS VERY PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE A SHERIFF AND A DA THAT OUR FRIENDS. GOING TO BARBECUES IN DOING THINGS OUTSIDE OF WORK TOGETHER. BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS IN BEING BEHOLDEN TO EACH OTHER THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY THAT CAN BE HAD WHEN RELATIONSHIPS ARE BUILT LIKE THAT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE CITY MANAGER AND THE POLICE BUT THE POLICE CHIEF SO. THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF RELATIONSHIPS. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT'S CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT ARE. NOT HELPFUL TO GETTING ACCOUNTABILITY. ALSO POLICIES AND LEGISLATION THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE REPERCUSSIONS ATTACHED TO THEM. SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF GOOD BILLS COME OUT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF POLICY CHANGES HERE LOCALLY IN SACRAMENTO. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT INCLUDING ANY TYPE OF REPERCUSSION OR ACCOUNTABILITY. INSIDE OF THOSE POLICIES IN THEIR VIOLATED AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAPPENS WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING THAT'S COME FORTH SINCE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK GET VIOLATED AND THERE'S NEVER ANY REPERCUSSIONS. IN THE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO SEE THE REPERCUSSIONS THE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS TRUST THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CAR OUR COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE. ALSO VETTING OFFICERS- FOR INVOLVEMENT WITH. WHITE NATIONALIST GROUPS AND OR MALICIOUS I PERSONALLY KNOW TWO OFFICERS IN THE SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS. ONE HAS AN EIGHTY EIGHT TATTOOED ON HIS HAND WITH THE DIAMOND TIPS WHICH STANDS FOR IT'S A HOW HITLER TATTOO. AND THEN OTHERS USE LANGUAGE CALLED OUR ALLIES REYES TRADERS SO IF WE'RE NOT HAVING A PROCESS TO VET OUR OFFICERS ON. THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS EITHER CULTURE ORGANIZATIONS THEN WE'RE FAILING BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTIVE TO THOSE TYPES TO BE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TO HAVE THE POWER TO KILL BLACK PEOPLE AND NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT. ALSO THE MENTALITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY'RE AT WAR WITH THE PEOPLE. THEY'RE TAKING THE SENTIMENT THE CENTER THAN SENTIMENT TO THE STREETS WHEN THEY'RE COMING TO OUR PROTESTER COMING TO OUR MARCHES WERE EXERCISING OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THEY'RE SHOOTING OUR CHILDREN IN THE FACE WITH RUBBER BULLETS. THEY'RE SHOOTING OUR FOLKS IN THE HEAD WITH A RUBBER BULLETS OVER THIS LAST COUPLE MONTHS WE HAD THREE MAJOR INJURIES AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ONE WAS A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD THAT WAS SHOT IN THIS IS FACING HE BROKE HIS CHEEKBONE. WITH A RUBBER BULLET AND IT'S AND I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF THESE. INCIDENTS OUR OFFICERS AIMING AT THE FACE IN THE HEAD OF PEOPLE WITH BULLETS THAT THEY THINK ARE LEAST LESS LEGAL FORMS OF FORCE BUT THEY CAN BECOME. LEGAL IN THAT WAY. ON THE SECOND WAS- A SACRAMENTO RESIDENT. THAT WAS SHOT SIX TIMES IN THE HEAD WITH RUBBER BULLETS HAVEN'T HAD A- A FRACTURED SCHOOL AND HAD TO HAVE SURGERY. AND THEN LASTLY AT ONE OF OUR PROTESTS- A TEENAGE GIRL WAS SHOT IN HER EYES SHE'S NO LONGER ABLE TO pOF HER LIFE. SO THIS IS THE KIND OF VIOLENCE THAT WE'RE FACING ONE WERE. ACTUALLY PROTESTING THE VIOLENCE THAT WE'VE BEEN FACING. WHERE WERE BEING MET WITH THE EXACT SAME VIOLENCE THAT WERE THAT WERE TRYING TO STOP HAVING HAPPENED. AND I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS. FOR FOLKS THAT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND THEY ARE NOT MET WITH THAT SAME BY VIOLENCE SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A RACIAL BIAS. WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW WHITE FOLKS GOING UP TO THE CAPITOL AND ACTING VIOLENT TOWARD COMMUNITY. THERE IS NO NATIONAL GUARD BEING CALLED. THERE IS NO RUBBER BULLETS BEING SHOT. THERE IS NO HELICOPTERS THERE IS NO VIOLENCE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT- SO I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT AS WELL. ALSO UNITS LIKE IN EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS THESE BUT LIKE THE GANG TASK OR GANG ENFORCEMENT TEAMS GETTING TASK UNITS- TEAMS LKE POP UNITS PROBLEM ORIENTED POLICING UNITS. THESE UNITS GOING TO THEY SPECIFICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY GOING TO BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES TO SPECIFICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY RACIALLY PROFILE PEOPLE BASED ON THINGS LIKE HAIRSTYLES AND CLOTHING CHOICES THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY PARTICULAR TO GANG MEMBERS OR EVEN TO BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT ISN'T CONNECTED TO THE ACTIVISTS BUT YOU KNOW THE VIOLENCE AN ACTIVIST COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THESE TEAMS AND THEIR AUTHORITY IN THEIR POWER AND THEIR THEIR LACK OF ANY TYPE OF CONNECTION TO THESE COMMUNITIES. THEY DON'T LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE POLICING AND SO THAT THAT HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS REFORMED. ALSO WE SEE A LOT OF. PROCRASTINATION AND IT SEEMS VERY INTENTIONAL BY LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS- PROCRASTINATION AND GETTING ANY TYPE OF RESOLUTION. AND THE PROCRASTINATION COMES IN THE FORM OF. COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS LET'S HAVE PUBLIC INPUT AND THEN WE GIVE THE PUBLIC INPUT AND THEN NO CHANGES ARE MADE OR WE GET PROMISES AND THEN NOT FOLLOWED BY CHANGES OR WE GET YOU KNOW PERFORMATIVE TYPE OF REACTIONS TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD BUT AND THEN WE GET PROMISES AFTER THAT AND THERE ARE NO CHANGES WE'VE GOT. WE'VE GOT MAYORS AND OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS GOING INTO BLACK COMMUNITIES AND GOING TO BLACK CHURCHES AND KNEELING WITH BLACK PEOPLE AND THEN THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING AFTER THAT AND THEN THAT NIGHT SOMEBODY MAY GET SHOT IN THE FACE OF THE RUBBER BULLET. SO THOSEARE THE- TYPES I DON'T KNOW WHAT REFORM COULD BE PUT IN PLACE FOR THAT BUT- THERE NEEDS TO BE. ACCOUNTABILITY ON EVERY SINGLE LEVEL- IN THE STATE THAT KILLS THE MOST PEOPLE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOUR ONE ONE MINUTE ONE MINUTE THANK YOU- OKAY SO. THE OLICE WILL CONTINUE TO MURDER US AS A FIRST RESORT AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT BEING PUNISHED FOR THEIR ACTIONS- WE'VE DANCED AROUND EVERY SUGGESTION BUT FOR SOME REASON INTENTIONALLY AVOID THE ONE THING THAT WILL STOP THIS ALL AND THAT'S ANY TYPE OF PUNISHMENT FOR THE ACTIONS OF JUST LIKE A CIVILIAN IF THEY KILLED SOMEBODY AND IT WAS WRONGFUL THEN THERE WOULD BE A PUNISHMENT. I'M A LOT OF TIMES YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAYING GET RID OF THE UNIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S NECESSARY WE STILL HAVE WE WILL STILL HAVE INTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS. AT THAT WILL CONFLICT WITH THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING- OR I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD LIMIT INTERNAL INTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS AS NECESSARY BUT EVEN IN DOING THAT WILL STILL NEED POLICIES THAT HAVE REPERCUSSIONS INCLUDED. I'M A LOT OF FOLKS WILL SAY THAT DIVERSITY AND TRAINING IS NECESSARY TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS AND I'D LIKE TO LASTLY QUOTE- A MEMBER OF OUR GROUP HIS NAME IS VICTOR BRAZELTON AND ONE OF THE DEMANDS THAT WE GAVE TO. OUR MAYOR IS THAT. THE COMMISSION SHOULD NO LONGER BE USED AS A TOOL OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO SEE DIVERSITY TO POLICING WHEN WE KNOW THAT THIS IS POLICING ITSELF THAT IS THE ISSUE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS GETTING MURDERED BY BLACK POLICE OFFICERS IS NOT THE ANSWER TO THE COULD THAT THE COMMUNITY IS LOOKING FOR- AND THEN LASTLY. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NEW APPOINTMENT OF AN ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOON BY THE MAYOR. I'M SORRY THE GOVERNOR AM I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY PUT IN THAT POSITION. THAT WORKS HARD IN STANDS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS PHASE ON FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- IN YOUR POWERFUL VOICE FOR THE COMMUNITY WE ARE REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. MEMBERS I JUST WANTED TO. THIS WAS SETTING THE STAGE- THAT'S WHY THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE COMMUNITY SPOKE. SO WE'LL BE MOVING. THE PORTION WE CAN DO QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS- AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE AGENDA SO WITH THAT BEING SAID ALSO- MISTER- THE PATENT OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS SPOKE THIS IS NOT A QUICK FIX AYE ONE UNDERSCORE THIS IS NOT A QUICK FIX WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS IN ORDER TO TEACH HIM WITHOUT A GOAL WAY- TO BRING COMMUNITY AND OTHERS INVOLVED INTO TRYING TO HELP US RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO. I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND OR- THE GOOD DOCTOR FOR SAYING THIS IS NOT A QUICK FIX IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO INVEST THE TIME INTO MAKING THIS HAPPEN SO WITH THAT BEING SAID AGAIN THANK THOSE- FOR SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR THIRD PRESENTER- MISTER. ALI KHAN I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME- THIS HE WAS AT OUR VERY FIRST HEARING SPOKE VERY TORRENTE HARDLY THERE IS EXPERTISE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN- FOUGHT FOR THIS PADDLE- FOR THIS- FOR THIS SEGMENT- WHO WILL BE JOINING US I PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY SOMALI CON AGAIN WELCOME YES. EIGHT MINUTES AND PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER. AND MEMBER OF THE SLOW COMMITTEE- FEEDBACK DISCUSS. THE ISSUE OF POLICE REFORM. HOW PROFESSIONALISM IS AT THE CORE OF AFFECTED POLICING AND IMPORTANTLY THE STATE'S ROLE IN CREATING THE SYSTEMS NECESSARY TO ENABLE PROFESSIONALISM. THAT CAN HELP BUILD PUBLIC TRUST REDUCE USES OF FORCE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES CRIME. THROUGH MY PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE AS A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR A SENIOR POLICY OFFICIAL A LAW SCHOOL GRADUATE SCHOOL PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF SPECIALIZED POLICE AGENCY AND ALSO WAS AN LAPD OFFICIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR REFORM EFFORTS. I HAVE LEARNED IN BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS TO MEANINGFUL REFORM. FIRST MEANINGFUL REFORM MUST ADDRESS THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF POLICING AND FOCUS ON THE QUALITY OF OFFICERS WHO WERE RECRUITED AND CERTIFIED TO SERVE IN THESE IMPORTANT ROLES. THE STANDARDS WHILE AN OFFICER IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT NECESSARY TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. SECOND REFORMS MUST ENABLE AGENCIES TO PERFORM ITS CORE FUNCTION OF PROTECTING COMMUNITIES FROM CORPORATE FROM CRIME. WELL STRENGTHENING THE PUBLIC'S TRUST THROUGH COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING AND PURSUING JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS THROUGH FAIR AND UNBIASED ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. IN MEANINGFUL REFORMS MUST BE BASED ON PROVEN EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PRACTICAL AND CAN BE APPLIED FOR LONG TERM IMPACT. AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY ON OCTOBER FOURTEENTH PROFESSIONALISM IN THE SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES OF PROFESSIONALISM THAT ALREADY EXIST FOR THE PROFESSIONS WE KNOW AND RESPECT SUCH AS BEING IN SUCH AS DOCTORS. LAWYERS ENGINEERS AND THE TEACHERS AND TEACHERS ARE THE KEY TO ACHIEVING THESE ELEMENTS OF MEANINGFUL REFORM IN POLICING. WE KNOW THIS BOTH FROM OUR OWN COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE THE EXPERIENCE OF AGENCIES THAT HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON REFORM THROUGH CONSENT DECREES IN ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP LIKE THE LAPD. AND WITH OVER FORTY YEARS OF SOUND ACADEMIC RESEARCH. WHY IS IT THAT PROFESSIONALISM POLICING IN ESSENCE IS SO IMPORTANT AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ESPECIALLY THE EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED. AND WHY ARE THEY SO IMPORTANT. IS BECAUSE AT ITS CORE THE DISCIPLINE OF POLICING IS NOT ABOUT USING FORCE MAKING ARRESTS CONDUCTING SEARCHES OR EVEN ISSUING CITATIONS THOSE ARE THE TOOLS AND THE POWERS THAT WE AS A SOCIETY GIVE TO POLICE OFFICERS AND ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT AT ITS CORE THE DISCIPLINE OF POLICING IS ABOUT SOLVING PROBLEMS AND MAKING CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS TO USE THOSE TOOLS AND POWERS. USING KNOWLEDGE IN CRIMINOLOGY PSYCHOLOGY HISTORY THE LAW IN THE MANY OTHER PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES THAT ACTUALLY FORM THE FOUNDATION OF POLICING. AND THE SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED TO BE A GOOD POLICE OFFICER IN SOLVING THOSE PROBLEMS. WHETHER YOU TO MAKE AN ARREST ISSUE CITATION SEARCH IN INDIVIDUAL SOLVE A CRIME IT REQUIRES CRITICAL THINKING IT REQUIRES ANALYSIS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT REQUIRES EXERCISING GOOD JUDGMENT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION. ESPECIALLY THE DECISION TO PRESS THE TRIGGER OF A FIREARM. AND USE DEADLY FORCE POLICING IS A SOPHISTICATED IN COMPLEX JOB AND ITS COMPLEXITIES ARE INCREASING EVERY DAY. YET THE POLICING PROFESSION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT REQUIRE THE EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION THAT DEVELOPS THESE CAPABILITIES AND INSTEAD RELIES TOO MUCH ON A SIX MONTH ACADEMY FOR INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES DEVELOPING THE STRUCTURES NECESSARY. TO PROMOTE PROFESSIONALISM. THE OF A SUS TRUST. LIKE DOCTORS ENGINEERS TEACHERS NURSES AND YES EVEN LAWYERS. IS TO HELP US WITH THESE MANY SENSITIVE INCONSEQUENTIAL PROBLEMS LIKE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY A LEGAL CLAIM. WE'RE TEACHING CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN ALSO APPLYING POLICING WE PLACE OUR TRUST IN THOSE PROFESSIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS. THAT DOCTORS LAWYERS AND ENGINEERS ARE EDUCATED AT THE COLLEGE OF GRADUATE LEVEL IN THEIR FIELD OF STUDY BEFORE THEY'RE GRANTED A LICENSE THAT THEY'RE ONLY LICENSE AFTER PROVEN UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DISCIPLINES. THAT THEY'VE ESTABLISHED PROFICIENCY IN THEIR KEY PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES. THAT THEY OWN THERE ARE WELL DEFINED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THERE WERE ENFORCEABLE REQUIREMENTS TO ADHERE TO ETHICAL CODES AND THAT THERE ARE SYSTEMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. NOT JUST AT THE MICRO LEVEL WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE PROFESSIONALS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPECT WE ALSO RESPECT PROFESSIONALS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE UNBIASED ACT WITH INTEGRITY EMPATHETIC TO OUR NEEDS AND CONCERNS AND EXERCISE EXCELLENT JUDGMENT BASED ON THEIR- EXPERTISE. THE CHALLENGES THE REFORM WE ARE FACING CURRENTLY ARE NOT SIMPLY A FUNCTION OF ROOTING OUT THE BAD APPLES WITHIN AN AGENCY IT IS MUCH BROADER AND WE NEED TO RECRUIT CERTIFY AND FURTHER DEVELOP OFFICERS TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY'D USE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS TO DIFFERENT THE TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT OPTIONS IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES THAT COMMUNICATE AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS AND THAT HAVE VERY GOOD DECISION MAKING SKILLS IN MAKING THESE POWERFUL. EXERCISING THEIR DISCRETION TO TAKE AWAY- THE LIBERTY OR LIFE OF SOMEONE. WE OF COURSE NEED OFFICERS WITH DEEP KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL EXPERTISE RESILIENCE PATIENCE AND PROFESSIONAL MATURITY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES. ARE SO CRITICAL ARE SO ESSENTIAL. SO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM THAT IS LACKING IN THE ENTRY LEVEL STANDARDS IS OF COURSE A COLLEGE EDUCATION. A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA IS INSUFFICIENT FOR ANY PROFESSION LET ALONE A PROFESSION OF SUCH A VAST DISCRETION COMPLEXITY AND THE NEED FOR PUBLIC TRUST AS POLICING. AND WHILE SOME INCENTIVES EXISTING AGENCIES IT IS NOT UNIFORM IT ONLY FORMS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF MANY AGENCIES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS IS NOT A NEW NOVEL OR SPECULATIVE IDEA IT IS BASED ON EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH THAT SPANS ALMOST FORTY YEARS. THE SITE THERE'S MANY CITATIONS IN THE WORK OF WILLIAM TERREL IN OTHER PROFESSORS AND SOME OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND FRAMEWORKS WILL OR ACT IN THE CALIFORIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WHICH IS REALLY PROMISING. BUT THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT OFFICERS OF THE FOR YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION HAVE MORE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITIES THAN THOSE WITH ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. ARE BETTER PROBLEM SOLVERS AND INNOVATORS A BETTER COMMUNICATION SKILLS BOTH VERBAL AND WRITTEN. ARE MORE OPEN MINDED TO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND IDEAS RECEIVE BETTER PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS FROM THEIR SUPERVISORS AND POLICE LEADERSHIP HAVE FEWER CITIZEN COMPLAINTS AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY YOU SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FORMS OF FORCE IN OTHER FORMS OF COERCION TO GAIN COMPLIANCE. THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE THAT A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE EDUCATION CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUES WE ARE DISCUSSING IN AMERICA TODAY. THAN ANY OTHER POLICY TACTIC OR RESTRICTION CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED. AND IF COUPLED WITH THE SYSTEM OF STANDARDS ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT IT CAN MAKE A MEANINGFUL LONG TERM DIFFERENCE IN POLICING. YEAH THIS IS NEITHER EASY NOR FREE AND IT HAS TO BE THOUGHTFUL MEASURED AND AT A PACE THAT AGENCIES CAN ADAPT TO THEIR VARYING SIZE AND CAPABILITIES. IT MUST MAKE SURE TO MITIGATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS THE DISPARATE IMPACT ON MINORITIES AND OTHER RECRUITMENT. YOU'LL HEAR IT SOON AND THEN X. ALL ABOUT RICK. AND THEM SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AND THOSE CHALLENGES ARE REAL. BUT THERE ARE FINANCIAL PATHWAYS IN WAYS TO MITIGATE THOSE ISSUES BY PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLEASE CANDIDATES AND LOOKING AT OTHER MODELS LIKE THE U. S. MILITARY. IN CONCLUSION I JUST WANT TO SAY THE POLICING CAN BE SEEN AS A JOB A CAREER OR WHAT BUT I BELIEVE IT IS WHICH IS A PROFESSIONAL CALLING. IT IS AND SHOULD BE A PROFESSIONAL CALLING SIMILAR TO WHAT. WE'VE SEEN IN MANY INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS AND SOME AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. BUT IF POLICING IS TRULY TO BE A PROFESSION AS ALL COMMUNITIES EXPECT AND DESERVE THEN WOMEN WE MUST ESTABLISH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF PROFESSIONALISM. THAT WE HAVEN'T EXPECT FOR OUR TEACHERS DOCTORS LAWYERS AND ENGINEERS. IT IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL METHOD TO NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF REFORM BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN SAFER COMMUNITIES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE PUBLIC'S TRUST. THAT WE ARE ALL SEEKING TO ACHIEVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER ALI KHAN FOR YOUR- YOUR PRESENTATION FOR YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS THEY ARE STARTING TO BELIEVE THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY ON POINT AND YOU TALKED ABOUT EVEN THIS TIME AROUND THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL THAT ONE MUST HAVE A MOVING IN THIS NEW GENERATION AND NEWAGE OF PUBLIC SAFETY SO WE APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAD MUCH DISCUSSION AROUND- THE% EDUCATION. A STANDPOINT OF OFFICERS SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE ASK ALL THE PRISONERS THAT YOU CAN JUST STICK AROUND JUST BRIEFLY- WE OPEN UP FOR THE Q. AND A SO MY COLLEAGUES MAY IN FACT HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IF YOUR YOUR SCHEDULE ALLOW YOU STAY ON WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU- BEAR WITH US IN THAT REGARD SO WITH THAT BEING SAID- WE WANT TO NOW BEGIN THE PANEL DISCUSSION AROUND RECRUITMENT. OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS EACH PANEL WILL HAVE AGAIN UP TO EIGHT MINUTES TO SPEAK AND PART OF THAT- WE ASK THAT YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND YOU WILL BE CALLED UPON- IN THE ORDER ON'T NOTED ON THE AGENDA. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. WE WANT TO MOVE- AND INVITE DR- SUTHERS- TOOL WILL BE JOINING US VIRTUALLY- DOCTORS OTHERS ARE YOU WITH US. YES I AM GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING AND MAKE YOU MAY PROCEEDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND THE TEAM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME THIS MORNING- MY COLLEAGUES AND ALL OF YOU WHO ARE WITH US. SUGGESTED TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY I MD PROFESSOR PRACTICE IN NATIONAL HOMELESS CHARITY. AT THE UNIVERSITY STUDY CALIFORNIA'S TOP PRICE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY. AND DIRECTOR OF THE STATE COMMITTEES INSTITUTE. AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO STAY IN OPENING IS THAT THERE'S THREE AREAS I LIKE TO COVER DURING THE TIME FRAME THAT I HAVE THE FIRST WILL BE RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS THE SECOND WILL BE. EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND THE LAST FIGHT WILL BE A LATERAL RECRUITMENT. THE LEGISLATIVE I COME TO THE SPACE. OUR HUMBLE BUT ON WITH DEEPER YOU BACK- I STARTED MY CAREER FORTY YEARS AGO IN SANTA MONICA POLICE DEPARTMENT. ENDED MY UNIFORM CAREER TEN YEARS AGO AT THE LOS ANGELES WORLD AIRPORTS POLICE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT CHIEF OVER HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE. IN BETWEEN I WAS REALLY HONORED TO SERVE. THE FBI SPECIAL AGENT WORKING FOR COUNTER INTELLIGENCE AND TERRORISM AS A MEMBER THEIR SWATI. SO ALL THAT HAPPENED HE SAID. I DIDN'T GROW UP ANY DIFFERENT THAN AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. BEING SUBJECTED TO POLICE MISCONDUCT AND ABUSE IS A YOUNG MAN WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I BECAME A POLICE OFFICER. BECAUSE MY DAD USED TO SAY YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE CAPSICUM OUTSIDE TOMORROW. SO PART OF THAT CHANGE. WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT FIRST IS THAT AS WE TALK AS WE DISCUSS. CHANGE AND REFORM REFORM HAS TO BE A TOP TO BOTTOM EFFORT. WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT RECRUITMENT IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF THIS MENTION THAT I WAS A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATOR ESTIMATES APPEAR VERY FAMILIAR WITH RECRUITMENT. I WAS ALSO A LITTLE STRUCTURE AND ACADEMY FACULTY MEMBER WE ARE HONDA POLICE ACADEMY SO I UNDERSTAND THAT VERY WELL. AT THE SAME TIME WE GOT A WHOLE CHIEF ACCOUNTABLE. SHE'S ARE APPOINTED BY MAYORS AND CITY COUNCILS WE DIDN'T MAKE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT THE BEST PERSON. WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THAT SELECTION. SO HAVING SAID THAT LET'S TALK ABOUT PROGRAMS. AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE NEED PROGRAMS THAT ENGAGE THE DESIRED DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IT'S TIME FOR US TO MINIMIZE THE TERM CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND MOVED TO A TERM OF TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE BY THAT I MEAN BUILDING COMMITTEE. FROM A PLACE OF POWER. WE HAVE TO MOVE AWAY FROM AN OFFENDER BASED PLATFORM OF EDUCATING PEOPLE IN THAT SYSTEM. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THIS COMING YEAR AND THE STOCK PRICE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE CHALLENGES THAT QUITE OFTEN. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE POLICE ARE ALWAYS INTERACTS THE CONFLICT. ALWAYS INTERACTIONS OF DISPUTE. FORTUNATELY I WAS. POWER PIECE ACT OF POLICE ACTIVITIES LEAGUE KID WHEN I GREW UP IN NEW JERSEY AND I HAD THOSE INTERACTIONS WITH OFFICERS THAT WAS MORE POSITIVE I PLAY SPORTS. ENGAGED IN OTHER ACTIVITIES I'M REALLY PROUD TO SAY I'M ONE OF THE FOUNDERS CO FOUNDERS. OF THE PAL PROGRAM IN SANTA MONICA PD. I THINK THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE TRY TO HAVE. A DEMOGRAPHIC OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. ADEPT PROGRAMS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT SPEAK ABOUT THIS I'M NOT GOING TO EXCLUDE PROGRESSIVES YOU KNOW TOO MANY QUESTIONS THE SUGGESTION TO JOIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT MAYBE CHARITY INTUITIVE OR EVEN OFFENSIVE. BUT IF THERE WERE MORE POLICE OFFICERS WHO CARED ABOUT THE THINGS PROGRESSIVE WALK LIKE MINIMIZING POLICE VIOLENCE. FINDING ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION AND ENSURING THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST WE ALL BENEFIT. A NEW GENERATION OF PROGRESSIVE LEANING POLICE OFFICERS WOULD HARDLY BE A NEW TO SAY RACIAL BIAS BUT THESE OFFICERS MIGHT BE OPEN TO SCRUTINIZING THEIR BEHAVIOR FOR EVIDENCE OF BIAS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERSHIP AS WE TALK ABOUT RECRUITING AND PROGRAMS THAT ENGAGE THE PUBLIC. SO WITH THAT LET ME MOVE ON TO EDUCATION HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE ARAFAT THE CONVOY OF NORTH MANY YEARS. AND I WANT TO MENTION THAT I ALSO SERVING THE INTERNATIONAL SO SHE'S OF CHIEFS OF POLICE RESEARCH ADVISORY BOARD AND DATA IS IMPORTANT HIS COMMENTS ABOUT THE FACT IT. EDUCATED OFFICERS USE FORCE ARE LESS LIKELY TO USE FORCE IS VERY TELLING. WE HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS SO THE FBI AS YOU KNOW REQUIRES A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND A PERSON IS TWENTY FOUR THREE YEARS OF AGE TO APPLY TO BUREAU. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF AN INCOMING. AGENT AT NEW AGENTS CLASS QUANTICO IS THIRTY YEARS OF AGE. THAT IS VERY TELLING BECAUSE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THEY GOT A LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT ALSO ADDS TO THE ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE WHICH MAKES THEM MORE IN TUNE PERHAPS TO DEALING WITH THE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS. WE TRIED THAT MODEL SANTA MONICA PD OVER FORTY YEARS AGO. WE HAD TEN APPLICANTS WHO ALL HAVE BACHELOR'S DEGREES. SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE ACADEMY WHEN THEY GOT TO THE FIELD TRAINING OFFICERS PROGRAM OR FTO PROGRAM NINE OF THEM FAIL. I JOKINGLY ALWAYS SAY TO PEOPLE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING INTELLIGENT BEING SMART. AND AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. THE ACADEMY TIME FRAME. IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IS FAR MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THE SIX MONTHS WE ALLOWED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES. OFFICERS PROBABLY SPEND ABOUT 223% OF THEIR TIME IN THE FIELD MAKING A DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO USE DEADLY FORCE YEAH AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT TRAINING IN THAT AREA. 90% OF THEIR TIME SPENT ON DISCRETIONARY DECISION MAKING YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING WITH AN POLICY. DOESN'T MEAN IT IS NECESSARY. WE NEED ANALYTICAL THINKERS. I WANNA START ADVOCATE OF COLLEGE DEGREES WE DON'T WANT TO ELIMINATE PEOPLE FROM OPPORTUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE LIMITED BY SOCIAL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION SO I WANT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS AS WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS MOVING FORWARD. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. LASTLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LATERAL. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU AS I DON'T WANT IT SO WE WANT A CHALLENGES BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE LETTER LAWSUIT FOR THOSE OFFICERS WHO HAVE SERVED IN OTHER AGENCIES IN THE STATE AND MOVED TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OFTEN FOR VERY POSITIVE REASONS. BUT SOMETIMES NOT. AS YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU'VE GOT A PERSON WITH EXPERIENCE THERE'S A COST SAVINGS. ON TRAINING. ON THE ACADEMY THE FIELD TRAINING OFFICERS PROGRAM IT'S A VERY BENEFICIAL PROGRAM. TO DEPARTMENTS GET LETTERS FROM OTHER PLACES. THE SAD PART IS WE ARE TRACKING OPTIONS OF HAD PROBLEMS AT OTHER PLACES. PARTICULAR OFFICES THAT HAVE BEEN FIRED. AND I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SEEKING TO HIRE POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE FIRED OR RESIGNED OVER MISCONDUCT AND OTHER AGENCIES. WITH THAT I WANT TO MENTION THE WORK WE'RE DOING AT THE STOCK PRICE SCHOOLS SAFE COMMITTEES INSTITUTE WE ARE LAUNCHING. IN THE FURTHERANCE OF THE LEGACY OF TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE REPRESENTATIVE JOHN LEWIS. WE'RE GOING TO BE CREATING THE LUIS. REGISTRY LEWIS STANDS FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK IN QUERY SYSTEM IT'S ENDORSED BY COMMITTEE STAKEHOLDERS ACADEMICS LAW ENFORCEMENT. BIPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT AND WE JUST COMPLETED A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY. THAT SAID THAT 80% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE DATE. SUPPORT A REGISTRY FOR OFFICERS FIRED FOR MISCONDUCT 74% REPUBLICANS 76% INDEPENDENCE AND 90% DEMOCRATS. SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THIS FIRST OF ALL THE PUBLIC DEBT GEORGE FLOYD IS AN UNDENIABLE INFLECTION POINT AND HISTORICAL ARC OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE CITIZENS THEY ARE SWORN TO BOTH PROTECT AND TO SERVE. ARGUABLY NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS THERE BEEN A MORE OPPORTUNE TIME FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES THAT CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES TO RESOLVE TO IMPROVE THESE ESSENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS TO ACHIEVE SAFE COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION THAT NECESSITATE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I THINK THIS WAS MADE THE COMMENT MADE EARLIER BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA LEADS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT ROLE AT THIS TIME. I LOOK FORWARD TO AGAIN ANY COMMENTS ANY QUESTIONS SUGGESTIONS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. CONTINUE COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS AND AGENCIES THAT WE WORK WITH EVERY DAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTORS OTHERS FOR YOUR-YOUR REMARKS YOUR COMMENTS MESS AROUND EDUCATION- PLEASE IF YOU COULD STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT WE WANT TO POSSIBLY REFER BACK TO YOU AT SOME POINT FROM MY COLLEAGUE STASSEN FOLLOW UP. QUESTIONS AND CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF- YOU KNOW LET ME JUST SAY AS WE AS WELL I'M GETTING READY TO PIVOT AND ASKED MR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF MCCARTY TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BY. BY REQUIRING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR MAKE IT IS SO UNREACHABLE FOR- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY TO ABSOLUTELY- BECOME CHANGE AGENTS AND BECOME POLICE OFFICER THAT'S WHEN THE REASONS WHY. I BECAME A POLICE OFFICER IT'S BECOME A CHANGE AGENT AND I KNOW THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE IF IN FACT WE REYES OF THE REQUIREMENT ARMS EDUCATION- BROUGHT BY REQUIRING YOU TO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE- BUT I WANNA EXPLORE THE ASSOCIATE OF SCIENCE DEGREE. HE'S OUT WITH A FOLLOW UP QUESTION WITH YOU SO WITH THAT I WANT TO POSSIBLE MEANT AND HAS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY JOIN IS TO REDUCE HIMSELF SAY A FEW WORDS AND THEY WERE GOING TO GO RIGHT TO. OUR NEXT PANELIST MISTER MCCARTY THANK YOU AT THE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ALL INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SPEAKER ACTUALLY IS OUR POLICE CHIEF HERE IN SACRAMENTO OKAY PLEASE DO CHIEF ON BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE IT YOU KNOW THERE IS A GREAT APPETITE. FOR POLICE REFORM AND CERTAINLY I'VE WORKED ON A FEW BILLS FROM A BECOME LAW BUT I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE COUNT ON- HAVING ROBUST DISCUSSIONS LIKE THIS AS OPPOSED TO JUST READING A BILL AND MOVING ON SO. I REALLY APPRECIATE DIGGING INTO THE WEEDS AND ENGAGING ON THIS SO WE CAN BETTER INFORM US- I THIS IS A VERY- TIMELY TOPIC RIGHT NOW AND ONE THING I'M GONNA ENGAGE WITH ART PARTY FUN LITTLE LATER IS THAT. THIS THIS POLICE DEPARTMENT HERE HAS A REQUIREMENT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SO I WANT TO SEE WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR ON ON THAT AND NOT AND I CONCUR THAT THE A VERSES THE- BE A IS SOMETHING. THAT I CAN I CONSIDERED IMPORTANT IF WE WANT. DIVERSIFY FAR TO PLAY DEPARTMENT AS SOMEONE GETS ALL SAID HOUR SO NOT SO. OF COURSE WATCHING. EARLY ON MY IPAD- IN YOUR JUST BEAT UP. YOU LASTLY. OUR RESIDENTS YOU HAVE FOR MY CONSTITUENTS HERE DOCTOR WAZEE TANYA FAISON. JIM IN THE LAND OF COURSE- CHIEF HAN SO WITH THAT. WELCOME TO FINE AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AND SO- PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY AND- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON AND THE COMMITTEE. TO HONOR TO BE HERE AND I APPRECIATE- THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO TRYING TO IMPROVE. OUR PROFESSION AND OUR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. I'M I THINK IT'S VERY RELEVANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- MY BACKGROUND IN REGARDS TO- RECRUITING BEFORE I GET INTO. SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON RECRUITING BUT- YOU KNOW I'VE I WAS BORN HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND HAVE LIVED IN THIS COMMUNITY MY ENTIRE LIFE I WAS GIVEN UP FOR ADOPTION AT BIRTH AND- WAS EXTREMELY LUCKY TO HAVE MY- MOM AND DAD ADOPT ME AT THREE MONTHS OLD. I GREW UP IN OAK PARK I WAS ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT ON AN OFFICER WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN. MY YOUNGER BROTHER WAS MURDERED AFTER HE GOT INVOLVED IN- THE DRUG BUSINESS HERE IN SACRAMENTO- I NEVER PLANNED ON BEING A POLICE OFFICER NEVER EVEN CROSSED MY MIND TO BE A POLICE OFFICER- I GOT INTO IT BY ACCIDENT THAT'S A LONG STORY- I DID NOT. PLAN ON MAKING LAW ENFORCEMENT MY PROFESSION INTEL I'VE BEEN A POLICE OFFICER FOR ALREADY ABOUT EIGHT YEARS. MY DEGREE IS NOT IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE MY DEGREES IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. I DON'T HAVE ANY DEGREES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. AND I'VE BEEN A POLICE OFFICER NOW FOR OVER THIRTY THREE YEARS THE LAST THREE PLUS YEARS AS CHIEF IN SACRAMENTO AND SIX PLUS YEARS BEFORE THAT AND ROADS WILL. SO RECRUITING- I THINK IT'S IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT I SPEAK TO- THE MAJOR MAJOR CITY CHIEFS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ON A REGULAR BASIS PROBABLY ON A WEEKLY OR- EVERY OTHER WEEK BASIS. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS RECRUITING. IS RECRUITING AND HIRING HIGHLY QUALIFIED PEOPLE I'M JUST IN SHEER NUMBERS BUT ALSO WITH DIVERSITY- AND THAT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CHALLENGES THAT EVERY CHIEF ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TALK ABOUT ESPECIALLY THE- MAJOR CITY CHIEFS. AND SO. I HAVE SOMETHING OF NOTE OVER THERE AND WE STRUGGLE WITH THAT SAME ISSUE IN SACRAMENTO. BUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF THE OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT HAS CHANGED AND I'D HASN'T CHANGED TO THE POINT WHERE WE WANT IT. BUT OUR RECRUITING HAS IMPROVED OUR APPLICATIONS ARE UP THE DIVERSITY IS UP SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT HOW WE ACCOMPLISHED IN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN TERMS OF HIRING HIGHLY QUALIFIED. GOOD EXPERIENCE PROPER PEOPLE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY SO AND TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN- WE HAD SIXTY SIX HUNDRED APPLICANTS FOR POLICE OFFICERS. AND BY THE WAY WE REQUIRE TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE TO BE A POLICE OFFICER- AND I STARTED WHEN I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD- SO I DIDN'T HAVE A DEGREE AND I WASN'T. NINETY SO AGAIN ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO WE HAD SIXTY SIX HUNDRED APPLICANTS LAST YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. WE ONLY HAD TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED OUT. AND OUT OF THOSE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED APPLICANTS WE FOUND SEVENTY THREE PEOPLE. SUITABLE FOR BEING HIRED AND SENT TO THE ACADEMY. THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF IDEA OF HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO APPLY JUST TO FIND SAY SEVENTY THREE. AND WE HAVE DROPPED. OVER HALF THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS THAT APPLIED IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY. THIS YEAR THROUGH NOVEMBER SO STILL WITH ANOTHER MONTH TO GO. WE'VE HAD TWENTY NINE ALMOST THREE THOUSAND APPLICANTS AND WILL PROBABLY GET MAYBE A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED MORE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. AND OUT OF THOSE APPLICANTS WE FOUND EIGHTY THREE THAT MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND MAKE IT THROUGH THE BACKGROUND. SO PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER APPLYING THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO BE POLICE OFFICERS- YOU YOU SAW I WAS OVER SIX THOUSAND ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE SEVEN YEARS AGO AND WHEN I APPLIED IT WAS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS MORE THAN THAT- SO IS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED. SO WE HAD TO RETHINK HOW WE RECRUIT AND HIRE. MEMBERS OF OUR DEPARTMENT SO IN REGARDS TO RECRUITING. WE DEVELOP THE DIVERSE RECRUITING STRATEGY WITH THE NEW CAMPAIGN THAT INCLUDED BILLBOARDS- CAMPAIGN THAT- SPOKE TO- BEING THE DIFFERENCE AS OPPOSED TO TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGNS OF EXCITEMENT. PURSUITS WHAT. WE ONE OF OUR OFFICERS AS A RAPPER AND HE RECORDED A SONG TITLED BE THE DIFFERENCE THAT WENT NATIONWIDE. AND JUST COMPLETELY CHANGED OUR RECRUITING CAMPAIGN AND RECRUITING ON IVERSE RADIO STATIONS BILLBOARDS THINGS LIKE THAT. WE ALSO HAVE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS PARTNERED WITH SAC STATE TO CREATE A PROGRAM AT SAC STATE THAT'S A LACK OF GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAM CALLED LAX LAW ENFORCEMENT CANDIDATES SCHOLARS. ARE ALSO WORKING WITH SACKS CITY COLLEGE SOME OF OUR JUNIOR COLLEGES TO ATTRACT. PEOPLE IN COLLEGE TO THIS JOB AND GET THEM EXPERIENCE THAT HELPS THEM THROUGH THE HIRING PROCESS AND HELPS THEM THROUGH THE BACKGROUND PROCESS IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS. OF THEIR PROGRAMS IS IT CAN'T JUST BE THERE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SCHOOL. SO WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM OTHER SCHOOLS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY BETTER NOT JUST CRIMINAL JUSTICE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIRE WITH- DIVERSE EXPERIENCES NOT JUST GENDER AND RACE- IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW MANY OF YOU I'M SURE I'VE HEARD OF OFFICER CHARLES SOLOMON. WHO WAS KILLED AS ONE OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS IN OUR CITY BUT SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE WE HIRED TO THE SAC STATE LET'S PROGRAM AND HER DEGREE WAS INJURED EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE. OF THAT PROGRAM TO GET DIVERSE. APPLICANTS INTERESTED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE ALSO IMPROVED SPEED. OF THE HIRING PROCESS THROUGH ONLINE- TEST TAKING AND SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS THAT WE GET THE NAMES BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. AND WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY GET STRUNG OUT IN THE PROCESS AND-IT TAKES TOO LONG. WE ALSO CREATED ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS WHICH IS IT WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WHERE I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY TIME ON. IS WE CAN NO LONGER EXPECT TO GET APPLICANTS THE WAY WE TRADITIONALLY HAVE AND AS A POLICE OFFICER POSITIONS TYPICALLY IN THEIR MID TWENTIES. THEY'RE JUST NOT APPLYING IN THOSE NUMBERS ANYMORE- AND WE STILL HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF GETTING PEOPLE FROM BACKGROUNDS THAT ARE QUALIFIED. SO WE CREATED I AND- GROUP POSITIONS LIKE INTERNS STUDENT TRAINEES. I MEAN SERVICE OFFICERS ARE ARE YOU MY HERE MCCOLLUM CSOS THESE ARE ALL ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS. OUR TIME POSITION THAT ARE BUILT TO WORK AROUND- PEOPLE'S COLLEGE SCHEDULES- AND THEY'RE REALLY THE ENTRY LEVEL THAT WE USED TO GET PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM THE INSIDE. AND DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE A FULL POLICE OFFICER DISPATCHER AND THOSE POSITIONS ARE WAY MORE DIVERSE. THAN WHAT WE TYPICALLY HAVE IN OTHER PLACES. BUT ALSO PART OF- THIS IS LEARNING NEW WAYS TO DO THINGS SO WE'VE INVITED OUR I'VE INVITED STANFORD WASHINGTON STATE CENTER FOR POLICING EQUITY. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP FARMS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALL TO REVIEW OUR DEPARTMENT. ALL SOME OF THEM ARE TEACHING HISTORY AND IMPLICIT BIAS IN OUR DEPARTMENT. AND THEY HAVE ALL COMING BACK WITH RECOMMENDATIONS OF HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP IN OUR COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO RETENTION. AND WHO DO WE SELECT THIS LEADERS SO ON OUR PROMOTION PANELS- WE ALWAYS INCLUDE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON THOSE PROMOTION PANELS AND WE NOW REQUIRE. REQUIRE FOR PROMOTIONS- READING MATERIAL SUCH AS POST TRAUMATIC SLAVE SYNDROME FROM DOCTOR JOIN YOUR GROUP BLINDSPOT REQUIRE PEOPLE TO TAKE THAT BLESSED ASSOCIATION TASK TO HARVARD. AND SO WE CAN EXPAND THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR LEADERS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO JOIN A GOOD DEPARTMENT THAT VALUES THEIR COMMUNITY. AND HAS DIVERSE LEADERSHIP SO THOSE ARE ALL PART OF IT BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME OF THE RESULTS. SO ARE IF YOU LOOK AT OUR CURRENT POLICE OFFICERS IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND YOU- LOOK AT THEM IN TERMS OF RACE AND GENDER- IN TERMS OF RACE AND GENDER WE ARE 42% VERSUS. OUR CURRENT POLICE OFFICERS. BUT IN OUR CSO ACADEMY THAT WE HAD THIS YEAR IT'S 75% VERSED. IN OUR STUDENTS TRAINEES IS 73% OF OURS. AND SO YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE OUR- OUR POLICE OFFICER ACADEMIES ARE NOW SEVENTY SIXTIES AND 70% THE FIRST BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE COMING THROUGH THOSE ENTRY LEVEL PROGRAMS. WHERE THEY START WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY YEARS OLD I STARTED AT THIS YEAR'S SHOW AT% TWENTY YEARS OLD. AND MY GOAL WAS TO- LEAVES- AND THIRTY THREE YEARS LATER I'M HERE- AS POLICE CHIEF WE ALSO HIRED A MASTER'S LEVEL SOCIAL WORKERS IS ALSO A PROFESSOR AT SAC STATE. SHE TEACHES A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER THINGS IN OUR DEPARTMENT BUT SHE ALSO RUNS OUR SOCIAL SERVICES DIVISION WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS OUR MENTAL HEALTH TEAM. AND HOMELESS SERVICES TEAM BUT BECAUSE SHE'S- THAT LEVEL OF THE SOCIAL WORKER WE ALSO HAVE SOCIAL WORK INTERNS. WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT OF BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE DEGREES THAT WORK IN OUR DEPARTMENT UNDERNEATH HER. AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE CHOSEN TO BECOME POLICE OFFICERS AFTER WORKING HERE SO AGAIN GETTING A DIVERSE. POOL OF PEOPLE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY WITH DIFFERENT NOT ONLY RACE AND GENDER BUT DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS DIFFERENT EDUCATION. AND I ALSO TEACH- AN EIGHT HOUR COURSE ON HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY THAT'S BEEN. THROUGH RESEARCH OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS INSIDE OUR DEPARTMENT AND OUTSIDE OUR DEPARTMENT. JOINT CLOSING WE CANNOT. WE CAN NO LONGER EXPECT TO RECRUIT AND HIRE HIGHLY QUALIFIED PEOPLE IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT THE SAME ALL THE WAY. THERE JUST NOT APPLYING ANYMORE SO WE HAVE TO EXPAND THE ENTRY LEVEL- WAYS THAT ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE NOT ONLY IN RACE AND GENDER BUT IN EXPERIENCE. AND GET PEOPLE AND- LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT AND SO THAT WILL THAT IS WHAT HAS ENABLED US TO GROW OUR RECRUITMENT FROM. THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF DECLINE AND I EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS WE EXPAND THOSE ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS. I AT THAT OUR FUTURE PROGRAMS TO OUR SWORN POSITIONS SO WITH THAT. WELL. CLOSE AND SAY THANK YOU YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND- I LOOK TO HEARING SPEECH. THANK YOU VERY. A CHEAP HIGH FOR- YOU AND YOUR EXPERTISE IN RECRUITMENT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- WE WANT TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT. PRESENTER MISTER YEA WHO JOINING US VIRTUALLY- TODAY AND SOME MISTER EA. ARE YOU WITH US. RIGHT YES I AM I'M HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU CAN PLEASE- AND IT IS A SELF AND THEN PROCEED YOU HAVE EIGHT MINUTES. AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU OF MY NAME'S GREG YEMEN THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF ADMINISTRATION FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. FOR ME TO SPEAK TODAY. IN OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTEEN THE US DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. COPPS OFFICE RELEASED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND PROVIDED NINETY FOUR RECORDS FINDINGS AND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. THE REPORT WAS COMMISSIONED AT THE REQUEST OF THE LATE. MAYOR ED LEE. IN RESPONSE. IN THEM. IN RESPONSE HIGH PROFILE COMMUNITIES ARE. FOR POLICE REFORM AS RESULT ALSO INVOLVE SHOOTINGS AND OTHER PUBLIC EVENTS THAT LEFT A VOID. IN TRUST BETWEEN THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMUNITY. THERE IS ASSESSED INCLUDING USE OF FORCE BIASED MEDIA POLICING. ACCOUNTABILITY AND HIRING AND PERSONNEL PRACTICES. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCED ITS WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COLLABORATIVE REFORM PROCESS WHAT DOES YOUR CISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO MADE A COMMITMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN OUR DEPARTMENT IT GATES IN A NEW WINDOW AND IT OVERSIGHT BODY TO CONTINUE TO WORK. DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCED ITS AGREEMENT. PUBLICLY VIOLATE AND REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF pTELL DOJ'S INDEPENDENT REVIEW HAS HELPED THE DEPARTMENT IN ITS CONTINUED EFFORTS TO PROMOTE TRUST TRANSPARENCY AND SAFETY. AS WE MOVE ON TO OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS OF THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT THE ASSESSMENT GAVE US SOME VALUABLE INFORMATION AND INSIGHT ON HOW THIS DEPARTMENT COULD IMPROVE AND AS WE KNOW THAT. ALONG WITH ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE BAY AREA AND THE COUNTRY WE'RE FACING A- TIGHT COMPETITION FOR NEW RECRUITS. SO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING A PROACTIVE STEP TO FURTHER INCREASE DIVERSITY EXPAND ACCORDED ELEMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS TO GAP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF MALE AND FEMALE SWORN POLICE OFFICERS. THE FOCUS OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORT IS TO CONTINUE TO CREATE A DIVERSE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT MIRRORS THE STAFF CISCO AT MEARS. SAN FRANCISCO'S DIVERSE POPULATION. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING. AND THEY'RE JUST CHALLENGES THAT WE CAN OVERCOME OF C. THE CODE PANDEMIC- AS SHE HAN MENTIONS A REDUCTION OF APPLICATIONS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAD- CLOSE TO FIVE THOUSAND APPLICANTS BECOME POLICE OFFICERS SAN FRANCISCO. BUT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. IT IS CUT IN HALF TO ABOUT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED- HIGH PROFILE LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED SHOOTINGS AND INCIDENTS ACROSS THIS NATION. I HAVE REALLY. TURN SOME FOLKS AWAY TO BECOME POLICE OFFICERS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FAMILY SUPPORT YOUR LOVED ONES BEING HURT. WELL THERE'S ALSO THE FEAR OF THE POTENTIAL BUCKLED EXPOSURES THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR RETREATS ARE APPLICANTS YOU. NOT ONLY. APPLYING TO BE POLICE OFFICERS OR OR HASN'T TO BECOME POLICE OFFICERS BUT ALSO THOSE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH OUR ACADEMY AND AT THE END OF COME TO DETERMINATION THAT THEY CAN'T DO THIS JOB BECAUSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY AND INDEPENDENT. WELL ONE OF OUR BIGGEST HURDLES AND BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT- WE NEED TO REALLY OVERCOME IS THAT THE STEREOTYPING THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE POLICE PROFESSION. AND REALLY IT'S ABOUT EDUCATING AND LETTING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE AND THE WHY WHAT THESE PROFESSION NEEDS AND FOR THEM TO LOOK BEYOND THE UNIFORMS AND THAT THERE'S A PERSON BEHIND THE PERSON IN THAT UNIFORM THEY'RE WILLING TO SERVE. AND PROTECT THEM. BUT WHAT IS WORKING FOR US IN OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS ARE REALLY A CANDIDATE MENTORSHIP PROGRAM WHERE OUR RECRUITERS. MAKE CONTACT WITH OUR WITH APPLICANTS CANDIDATES AND HELP THEM ALONG THE PROCESS PROVIDE THEM WITH WORKSHOPS TO SYSTEM IN TESTING AND PHYSICAL TESTING COMPONENTS ALONG WITH THE PHYSICAL ABILITIES COMPOUNDS. WE HAVE FOCUSED CAMPAIGNS- SUCH AS OUR FOCUS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ON FEMALE APPLICANTS. AND THEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I'LL CONTINUE ON WITH NOW IS THE TIME TO COME POLICE OFFICERS. ARE WHITE G. FOUR MENTIONED WE'RE GOING AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL SWATCH AND THE- MILITARISTIC. IMAGE BULK LEASING REALLY SHOWING THE DIVERSE MAKE UP OF SAN FRANCISCO POLICE OFFICERS. AND CHANGE THE WAY WE TREAT ALSO INCLUDES THE PAOK. AND AN ASSAULT ALSO ARE PAID POLICE CADETS. WHO ARE GROWING UP THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT AND THEN. AFTER FINISHING COLLEGE MAKING A TERMINATION THAT YOU WANT STANCES FOR POLICE OFFICERS. WELL IN ADDITION TO THAT- WE STILL. HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH COLLEGES BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WELL COLLEGE RECRUITING PUTS US IN CONTACT WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF HIGHLY EDUCATED CANDIDATES- TAKING OUR TESTING. PRE PANDEMIC TAKING OUR TESTING AND ARE JUST GO BUILD THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKSHOPS INTO THE COMMUNITIES- SO WE BRINGS WE BRING SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY MOST OF THEM COMING TO OUR FACILITIES TO. TAKE UP TO. WE ARE INTESTINE ASSISTANCE AND MORE- MENTORSHIP. WE ALSO ANALYZE OUR PRACTICES IN OUR AND OUR. NEXUS LOOK AT ARE WE CREATING ANY BARRIERS FOR CANDIDATES AND RECRUITS. ALL OF THE OLD TRIGGER PULL WELL THAT WAS AROUND FOR MANY MANY YEARS NO AS A GROUP TRIP. STRENGTH ASSESSMENT WAS THAT REALLY REAL ISN'T REALLY RELEVANT TODAY'S OF. AND HOW DID THAT IMPACT MALE VERSUS FEMALE CANDIDATES SO WE MADE SOME CHANGES AFTER LOOKING AT THAT DATA LOOKING AT THE TESTING PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THERE IS EXISTENCE AND WORKERS CAN YOU TAKE AWAY. BUT LOOKING AT OUR MODEL FOR POLICING. IT STARTS WITH OUR STRATEGIC STATE. ANTISEPSIS COMPLETE PRODUCT STANDS FOR SAFETY WITH RESPECT FOR ALL ENGAGING IN JUST TRANSPARENT UNBIASED AND RESPONSE RESYNC. DOING SO IN THE SPIRIT OF DIGNITY IN AND COLLECT IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY MAINTAINING AND BUILDING TRUST AND RESPECT. AS GUARDIANS OF THE COST OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. AS AS THAT IS OUR STRATEGY STATEMENT ALONG WITH OUR FIVE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF COLLABORATION GROUP RESPONSIVENESS MEASURING AND COMMUNICATING STRENGTHENING OUR DEPARTMENT. FIND IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S THE STANDARD AND THAT'S THE MODEL WHICH ARE RECRUIT. WORKERS FROM OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN OUR RECRUITMENT MODEL BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING OUR PARTNERSHIPS. IN ADDITION AND IN AN FOR US TO DO THAT OTHER SERVICES GO PLEASE FARM HAS A FULL TIME RECRUITMENT STAFF WITH ONE SERGEANT FREE POLICE OFFICERS INTO PROFESSIONAL STAFF RECRUITERS. GROUP WHO HAVE WORKING FIRST AT. THE SPANISH PACIFIC ISLANDER AFRICAN AMERICAN FILIPINO LOCATION NH. WELL IN ADDITION OUR TIME STAFF WE HAVE OVER EIGHTY. OF SERGEANTS AND POLICE ARE LEASE OFFICERS AS A PART TIME RECRUITERS 60% MALE 40% FEMALE OUR BY OUR RECRUITERS ARE BILINGUAL- FOR EXAMPLE HE SPEAKS ARABIC CANTONESE MANDARIN MAND MANDARIN JAPANESE KOREAN RUSSIAN SPANISH TAGALOG VIETNAMESE. NOW THESE THIS RECRUITMENT TEAM IN BODIES IN VARIOUS STRATEGIC STATEMENT AND OUR MISSION OF CLUSTERS WITH THAT. THEIR HEART AND MINDSET THEY REACH OUT AND RECRUIT AND SPREAD THE MESSAGE OF WHAT SAN FRANCISCO MEANS WHAT SAM CISCO VALUES AND ARE THEY WILLING AND ARE THEY ABLE ARE THEY COMMITTED TO BODY THOSE THOSE SAME VALUES SAN FRANCISCO POLICE OFFICERS. IN ADDITION TO. YOUR TALK ABOUT DATA WE ESTABLISHED A STAFF INTO ONE UNIT AND HAS ANALYSTS IN IT TO REALLY TRACK OR DATA TRACK OUR PROGRESS IN IN. STATE INDETERMINATE. ARE THERE. ANY IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO TO DIVERSIFY THIS POLICE DEPARTMENT WHAT WHAT IS THE RESULT OF OUR TESTING WHAT'S THE RESULTS SO FAR ACADEMY PROCEDURES- ARE WE DOING AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE IMPROVE ON OUR PRACTICES WHAT A BIG COMPONENT THAT WE STARTED THIS YEAR. BUT WAS HAMPERED BY THE- AND THEN IT WAS OUR COMMUNITY AMBASSADOR PROGRAM. WHERE OUR RECRUITMENT UNITS REACHING OUT TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE CITY- ELICITING THEIR SUPPORT AND WE HAVE THEIR SUPPORT TO HOST RECRUITING EVENTS RECOMMENDING RECRUITING LOCATIONS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND ALSO REFERRING CANDIDATES OR RECRUITERS BUT THE GENIE. IS A BIG COMPONENT OF. OUR BIG IS AN EXTENT AN ARM OF WAR EFFORTS TO RECRUIT THE MOST QUALIFIED AND MOST DIVERSITY SERGEANTS AT SAN FRANCISCO. LASTLY I JUST WANT TO AND THAT YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY WITH LOCALS. AND WE STRIVE FOR DIVERSE POLICE DEPARTMENT WHAT PROFESSIONAL BODIES RETALIATES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT OFFICERS YOU CAN COMMUNICATE IN SPANISH CHINESE AND RUSSIAN TO BETTER ASSIST THE COMMUNITY. OFFICERS UNDERSTAND CULTURAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS THAT EXIST WITHIN YOU CAN BETTER ASSIST. TO AS OF TODAY THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT. SWORN MEMBERS. IS APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR OFFICERS ARE CERTIFIED IN SPANISH MANDARIN CANTONESE TELL GOLOVKIN RUSSIAN. THERE ARE SWORN STAFF IS 8585% MALE 50% FEMALE. IN A RECRUIT CLASSES ARE 70% OF GROUPS OF PEOPLE CALLING. AND THAT'S ALL HAPPENED I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND OPPORTUNITIES ALL LOOK FORWARD TO ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO BETTER THIS PROFESSION IN THE FIRST FIVE MEMBERS OF OFFICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THIS GREAT STATE. SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK% YOU VERY MUCH MR YE WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. AND YOUR- YOUR EXPERTISE AND JOINING US- TO- GIVE US- BIRDS EYE VIEW IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT. AGAIN I THINK OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS CERTAINLY TO ASSESS THE THAT THE PAST AS WELL AS LOOK AT THE- THE CURRENT STATE WE'RE IN TO TRY TO REACH SOME KIND OF. POSITIVE CONCLUSION- MOVING FORWARD SO MEMBERS OF THOSE WHO ARE VIRTUALLY JOINING US I WOULD ASK IF YOU WANT TO GET IN THE QUEUE WE ARE AT THE POINT NOW. WHERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM ANY OTHER PRESENTERS WHO ARE STILL HOPEFULLY ON THE LINE WITH US- WE DO HAVE- RB K. REBEKAH. CON JOINING US IN A FEW MOMENTS BUT AGAIN PLEASE TAX ME- I SEE YOU ALL RECOGNIZE YOU HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS SO WE WOULD ASK. OUR B. K. WOULD YOU PLEASE PROCEED ASK YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I THINK THIS IS DIRECTLY THIS DROUGHT CON IN CHIEF HìNH. BUT AND THE CHIEF MENTIONED THAT IT'S FROM APPLICATION TO THE- ELIGIBILITY HE LOSES ABOUT 90% OF APPLICANTS I THINK THAT WAS THE DATA THAT HE CITED. AND I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE THAT MANY pMAKE IT TO ACADEMY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE PEOPLE WHO ARE FLYING. BUT DON'T MAKE IT TO EVEN BE POTENTIALLY IN THE RANKS OF OUR POLICE FORCES. I WANT UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE FACTORS ARE THAT DR 90% OF PEOPLE TO NOT BE ELIGIBLE. ARE THOSE THINGS HAVING A DISPARATE IMPACT ON WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. ARE SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TO MAKE THOSE ELIGIBLE MORE DIVERSE OUR LITTLE ALL OF THOSE. THINGS CRITICAL TO A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AND TRUSTWORTHY POLICE FORCE EVERYTHING'S. WE SHOULD HOLD ON TO- AS MISS VICE ON MENTIONED ARE THERE OTHER FACTORS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT SHOULD MAKE FOLKS INELIGIBLE TO MAKE IT TO THAT FINAL PHASE FOR EXAMPLE- EXPERIENCE OR TIES TO WHITE SUPREMACY GROUPS SO. I PUT IT BACK TO YOU BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO SPEAK FURTHER ABOUT THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THANK YOU. I COULD SPEAK UP AT THE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I CAN SPEAK. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE MY EXPERIENCE THE ONLY POLICE DEPARTMENT THE BIGGEST FACTOR I THINK IN Y. CANDIDATES WILL WILL MAYBE DROP OFF DURING THE PROCESS IS A LARGE PART TIME. THE TIME REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION AND GO THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT STEPS AND PROCESS THESE CAN BE VERY LENGTHY. IT COULD BE A MATTER OF YOU KNOW. TWO THREE MONTHS TO SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR DEPENDING ON. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND MANY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG FOR A JOB. I'M IN TERMS OF THE FACTORS THERE VARIETY OF FACTORS WHY PEOPLE MAY SCREEN OUT AND DEPARTMENTS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER AT MAKING SURE THEY MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS BEFORE EVEN APPLYING. ONE BUT IT'S A VERY RIGOROUS PROCESS IN TERMS OF TESTING YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THEIR PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES- I'VE WRITTEN AND ORAL TASKS- PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING WHICH TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF TIME- THOSE TYPES OF THINGS LOOKING AT SORT OF THOSE MINIMUM OCCUPATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. I THINK THE ONE AREA THAT IS WORTHY OF EXPLORATION IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS IS DEPARTMENTS TO CONTINUE TO USE HOLOGRAPH EXAMINATION- THE POLYGRAPH. HAS ITS UTILITY BUT I'VE ALWAYS QUESTIONED IT BOTH AS WHEN I WAS A PROSECUTOR IN THE PROCESS NOW ABOUT ITS VALIDITY. THE SCIENTIFIC WAY. TO BE ABLE TO TRULY FIND DECEPTION. IT COULD BE USED AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE WILL CONFESS TO THINGS- BEFORE THEY- I'M TO THE POLYGRAPH BUT THE CHANCES OF FALSE POSITIVES AND FALSE NEGATIVES ARE ARE STILL VERY HIGH. IN IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT A USEFUL TOOL BUT I REALLY WANT TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME EFFORT MONEY. WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON MORE THOROUGH BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS LOOKING AT- TALKING TO MORE SO SEE IT'S LOOKING ESPECIALLY IF A CANDIDATE LIVES ELSEWHERE- IN THE VALUE OF THAT TO FIND THOSE ASSOCIATIONS THAT YOU. YOU ALLUDED. TO OF BIAS AND OTHER THINGS. THANK YOU VERY. BOB I'LL JUMP IN- YEAH THERE'S ALL SORTS OF RE WHY DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH- BUT THE BIGGEST FACTOR IS THE GROUPS THAT WE ARE LOW ON WHICH YOUR- TO BE MORE SPECIFIC IS AFRICAN AMERICAN HISPANIC WOMEN. IS STARTS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WE HAVE VERY FEW OF THOSE GROUPS A PLOT- AND SO PART OF IT IS HOW DO WE CHANGE THE PERCEPTION AND THOSE SORT OF THINGS AMONGST GROUPS THAT START OUT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY DON'T APPLY- BUT THERE'S ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THEY GET KICKED OUT WITH THE BACKGROUND IS A VERY EXTENSIVE. THEY'LL GO OT OF STATE IF YOU'RE FROM OUT OF STATE THEY TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS THEY GO TO YOUR SCHOOLS THEY LOOK AT YOUR PERSONNEL FILE IF YOU'RE FROM ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OR EVEN APPLIED AT ANOTHER DEPARTMENT SO IF YOU'VE APPLIED FOR THREE OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATORS GO LOOK AT YOUR BACKGROUND PACKET THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND IF YOU TOLD THEM SOMETHING YOU DON'T TELL US THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT. SO THAT- I'LL JUST THE- A LITTLE BIT IT'S A INVALUABLE TOOL SOME PEOPLE USE A VOICE. STRESS TEST WE USE A POLYGRAPH WE FOUND OUT A LOT OF THINGS TO THE POLYGRAPH THAT. WE DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T TELL US. BEFORE THE POLYGRAPH SO IS CRITICAL PART OF THE PROCESS. I MEAN YOU GET OTHER CHANCES TO TAKE POLYGRAPH IF YOU DON'T PASS A QUESTION TO SEE IF WELL MAYBE JUST LEFT SOME OUTLETS WILL RECHECK IT. AND THEN SOME PEOPLE PASS AT THAT POINT. I'M BUT THE OTHER THING AND- MANY ALVAREZ IS ON HERE SO HE AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND POST IS WORKING ON THIS. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT- IS CRITICAL IN THE HIRING PROCESS IS OBVIOUSLY. YOU DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE ACADEMY YOU GOT HIRED BUT- LIKE YOU'RE STILL NOT AN OFFICER ON THE STREET BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE ACADEMY SO. TO ME THAT'S SORT OF PART OF THE HIRING PROCESS. AND WHAT WE FOUND IN YEARS PAST THAT- LIKE THE TWO ACADEMIES PRIOR TO ME. BEING SWORN IN AS CHIEF HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE LOST AND I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PEOPLE WERE KICKED OUT OF. A TOTAL OF TWO ACADEMIES. EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS DIVERSE. SO THE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WE KICKED OUT WAS EITHER- RACIAL RACIALLY DIVERSE OR GENDER DIFFERS. IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WAS KICKED OUT FOR SHOOTING RANGE. OR DRIVING. TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ARE LEARNED- SKILLS SO WE DON'T WANT TO LOWER THE STANDARDS- BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DRIVE AND YOU NEED TO KNOW- THE RANGE. BUT TO ME PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY CAN LEARN THOSE SKILLS BUT WE DON'T ALL START AT THE SAME SPOT FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN I WAS IN THE ACADEMY I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD I'VE NEVER TOUCHED A GUN BEFORE. MY ROOMMATE WAS FIFTY THREE YEARS OLD AND- JUST SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN THE MILITARY. I THINK YOU CAN JUST HAVE CLASS TOMORROW WE'RE GONNA BE OF THE SAME SPOT. I MEAN I'M LEARNING HOW TO PUT THE MAGAZINE IN THE GUN AND HE CAN SHOOT IT THROUGH A ONE INCH HOLE OR THIRTY ROUNDS. IN SO IT MIGHT TAKE ME A MONTH TO GET THAT SKILL WHERE'S HE. STARTS OUT WITH THAT SKILL. BUT THE RULES ALWAYS HAD S. THIS IS. ACT THE SAME. LIKE I HAVE LEARN IT IN A CERTAIN OF TIME. SO ONE WE'RE WORKING ON A LOT OF THOSE THINGS WITH POST. BUT THE OTHER THING WE DID IS INSTEAD IT WOULD BE FOR THE SIX MONTH ACADEMY WE NOW HAVE A PRE ACADEMY. OR WE PUT ALL OUR PEOPLE THROUGH A MONTH TO A MONTH AND A HALF OF A PRE ACADEMY. WHERE IT'S HEAVY ON RANGE AND DRIVING AND WE HAVE KICKED VERY FEW PEOPLE OUT OF THE ACADEMY DUE TO THOSE THINGS. BUT PRIOR TO THAT WE WERE LOOSE THE THAT LITTLE BIT OF DIVERSITY THAT WE WERE GETTING AT THAT TIME. BEFORE WE'VE REVAMPED OUR RECRUITING AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS AFFECT STATE THAT WE'VE DONE- THE LITTLE BIT THAT WE RECRUIT. AT WHERE WE'RE HIRING A LOT OF IT WE WERE KICKING OUT AN ACADEMY FOR THOSE TWO ISSUES AND THAT HAS BEEN SOLVED SO. SOME OF THESE THINGS YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PROCESS AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME OTHER WAY WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE GET. THANK YOU CAN I ASK ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION MISTER CHAIR. SURE OF HIS BRIEF YES OKAY THANKS- SO THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS- HELPFUL INFORMATION BOTH OF YOU AND I THINK IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CULTURE OF POLICING SO THAT MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN WANT TO JOIN THE RANKS FROM THE GET GO AND LOCAL EYES CHIU HUNT POINTED AT. MY LAST QUESTION IS- DEBTS WHAT ROLE DOES THAT PLAY IN- THAT BACKGROUND IN HOW DOES ITEM AND IS ESSENTIALLY DISPROPORTIONATE. THANK YOU. YEAH I'LL I'LL- DO THAT EVERYTHING IS- LOOKED AT COLLECTIVELY SO MEANING THAT ISN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL BUT IF YOU HAVE EVERY SINGLE COUNT YOU'VE HAD OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. IN COLLECTIONS. AND THAT SHOWS IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. BUT EVEN IF YOU HAD COLLECTIONS FIVE YEARS AGO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR PAST. IF YOU HAVE. A TRACK RECORD AFTER THAT THAT MEANS OKAY YOU LEARN FROM THOSE MISTAKES THAT YOU MADE. AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING GOOD DECISIONS THEN YOU'RE FINE SO DEBT ITSELF DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING YOUR BILLS IF YOU AREN'T COLLECTIONS IF YOU HAD DONE FOR COMPUTERS. THOSE SORT OF THINGS DO MATTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT WE WILL HAVE A MISTER A MEMBER REYES. AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAVE MISTER- A MEMBER- MCCARTY AND THEN MAYES RUBIO AND THEY MISS GONZALEZ IN THAT ORDER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS THIS IS WONDERFUL I APPRECIATE- THE RECOGNITION THAT THIS ISN'T A QUICK FIX. AND SO THAT THAT WITH OUR CHAIR PUTTING TOGETHER. AND NOT JUST ONE HEARING BUT A NUMBER OF HEARINGS OTHER WILL PROGRESSIVELY TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES IDENTIFYING THEM AND THEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ADDRESS THEM. OF THIS BASED ON I APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENT THAT THE COMMUNITY THAT IS MOST IMPACTED SHOULD LEAD THE DISCUSSION- MY QUESTION TO YOU IF YOU WERE STILL WITH US IS HOW DO YOU SEE THAT SPECIFICALLY HAPPENING. WHERE AT WHAT POINT DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING. SHE'S COING TO THE MICROPHONE NOW YES YOU MAY PROCEED. NO I THINK HE'S GOING TO ADJUSTING MICROPHONE. AND WE'LL TRY TO SEE IF THAT WORKS. YES IT'S ON. MAKE SURE YOUR CLOTHES YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THE QUESTION IS SPECIFICALLY HOW- YOU ASKED HOW DO I HI INVISION COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT AND COMMUNITY LEADING IN THE MOST IMPACTED LEADING I THINK THAT WE NEED INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY WE NEED- WE NEED SPACES WHERE COMMUNITY CAN GIVE SUGGESTIONS WE NEED THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE MOST IMPACTED. TO TELL YOU THEIR EXPERIENCES SO THAT OUR LEGISLATORS CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE BASED ON THOSE EXPERIENCES- WE HAVE I'VE I WORK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN COMMUNITY AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMMONALITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND AS LONG AS THOSE THINGS CONTINUE TO HAPPEN THEN THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND IF WE'RE NOT HEARING. HOW YOU KNOW A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS BEEN PULLED OVER TWICE. AND HAD GUNS DRAWN ON HIM BY POLICE WHEN HE HASN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING WRONG IF YOU'RE NOT HEARING THE STORIES THEN. YOU DON'T KNOW THEY'RE HAPPENING IN THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE EARLIER. I SAW THE EXPRESSIONS OF SOME OF THE FOLKS IN HERE WHEN THEY HEARD YOU KNOW THE EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING ACTIVIST WORK IN THE STREETS. AND THEY WERE SURPRISED TO EVEN HEAR THAT A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY GOT SHOT WITH A RUBBER BULLET WHILE AT A PROTEST BY A POLICE OFFICER. SO I THINK BASICALLY IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO LISTENING TO. THE COMMUNITY AND THEIR EXPERIENCES AND THEN. CREATING LEGISLATION AROUND THOSE EXPERIENCES AND SEEING THE COMMONALITIES IN ALL OF THESE EXPERIENCES. WHILE YOU'RE- YES AND WHILE YOU'RE THERE ONE OTHER QUESTION A FOLLOW UP YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR- ABOUT BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT SPECIALLY POLICE CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS AND OUR ELECTED. DO YOU SEE A PARTICULAR WAY TO- AND LET WEATHER LET THAT THROUGH LEGISLATION OR THROUGH RULES OF- PROMULGATED AT THE COUNTY OR THE CITY LEVEL THAT WOULD ASSIST IN. SEPARATING THESE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT- CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS AND ELECTIVES. SO I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON LEGISLATION- SO I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR LEGISLATORS TO GET CREATIVE IN THAT AREA- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO MENTION THAT THESE ARE REALLY BIG. OBSTACLES IN COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW. AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO SACRAMENTO IN PARTICULAR- ARE. OUR SHERIFF HAS A VERY STRONG ANTI POLLUTION SHOULD WITH OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY. AND AS A RESULT HER RECORD OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S RECORD HAS NEVER SERVE THE PEOPLE- ALSO YOU KNOW OUR POLICE CHIEF AND OUR MAYOR AND OUR- OUR- CITY MANAGER THEY ALL HAVE A VERY. GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER WE OFTEN SEE THE CITY MANAGER INTERMINGLING WITH DIFFERENT POLICE OFFICERS YOU KNOW WHILE HE'S OUT DOING HIS WORK. AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE CASUAL CONVERSATIONS I'VE SEEN OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE BACKDOOR YOU KNOW COME OUT OF A ROOM WITH OUR- THE SACRAMENTO POLICE. OFFICERS ASSOCIATION- I WANT TO SAY IS TITLES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S NAME IS TIM DAVIS I'VESEEN THEM COME OUT A ROOMS PETTING EACH OTHER'S BACKS AND I THINK ALL OF THAT IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THEY'RE BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OTHER. AND AS A RESULT THEY'RE BEHOLDEN TO EACH OTHER AND THEY'RE NOT BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY AND FINDING OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO COMMUNITY- I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP ALL THAT IN MIND WHILE MAKING LEGISLATION BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU- WHAT THAT LEGISLATION AS TO HOW HOW THE KID. HOW REFORM COULD BE MADE THROUGH LEGISLATION TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE ACTUALLY AFFECTED OF. THANK YOU KNOW WHAT IS A WISE FRIEND ONCE TOLD ME THAT IT ISN'T JUST THE YEAR PROPRIETY BUT THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY. THAT WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED WITH. THANK YOU SO MUCH.MISTER CHAIR ONE LAST QUESTION- IF IT'S QUICK YES. GREAT HAVE ALL RIGHT- IT'S- IN THE END OF THE QUESTION IS- DO ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. DO ANY KIND OF PERSONALITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS BEFORE HIRING AN OFFICER OR ALLOWING SOMEONE TO TRAIN- TYPICALLY THESE ARE DONE AFTER THERE'S BEEN USE OF A WEAPON- OR OR OR OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT BUT MY QUESTION IS. I DON'T DO IT DON'T DO ANY OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DO THIS BEFOREHAND- IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS. CHIEF HARVESTER WITH US OR ANYONE OUR PRESENTERS THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT QUESTION OF MYSTERIOUS. WELL JUST ASSEMBLY MEMBER GETS YES WE DO IN THE HIRING PROCESS YOU HAVE TO. GO FAR PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAM AND WE'VE DONE THAT. FOR AT LEAST THIRTY THREE YEARS BECAUSE I HAD TO DO IT AND WE ARE ACTUALLY EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING GREG OUR EXAM ON OUR EXISTING OFFICERS. BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THAT NEGOTIATIONS AND THINGS BUT YES EVERY OFFICER THAT IS FIRED ON THIS POLICE DEPARTMENT. FOR SEVERAL THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES HAS HAD TO HAVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WE WANT MISTER CHAIR ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. WE WANT TO GO TO MR MCCARTY AND THEN MISS RUBIO AND THEN MISS GONZALEZ IN THAT ORDER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS AND A QUESTION- THE FIRST IS I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT THE ICE I GREATLY APPRECIATE OUR OUR POLICE CHIEF. DANIEL HAHN- CHIEF ON SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE ARE JUST SAID WELL WE NEED MORE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND I REALIZED TO THAT'S NOT JUST WHAT LAWS WE RIGHT HERE AT THE CAPITOL ALL THIS IS BASED UPON LEADERSHIP WE HAVE. IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. A CHANGING THE- THERE RICK THE RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING PROCESS TO TAKE MAKING SURE WE DON'T WEED OUT PEOPLE. WHO GOT AS YOU SAID THAT WAS VERY STRIKING THAT ALMOST ALL THE SEGMENTS ALL JUST ABOUT ALL OF THAT- TWENTY OR SO APPLICANTS WERE YOU KNOW WOMEN OR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THOSE THAT THAT'S A WORD THE MORNING pSTREETS AND SO. NO THAT'S THAT'S NOT LAWS THAT WE CAN RIGHT HERE PER SE I'M CERTAINLY MAYBE- POSTED SOME DIRECTION THERE BUT THAT'S BUT FOR LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE STATE- I WANTED TO NOW TALK ABOUT. THE RECRUITMENT AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFICERS AND ASK- IT YEAH CHIEF HAN AND ALSO WGP IF YOU CAN LIGHT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A BAD. SO I I'VE ALL I'VE OFTEN WONDERED ABOUT ABOUT OFFICERS AND THEIR- EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND WE TALKED ABOUT OFFICER SULLIVAN WHO'D WHO TRAGICALLY WAS SHOT MURDER HERE. IN SACRAMENTO AND SHE HAD A DEGREE IN EARLY EDUCATION I ALWAYS A MEMBER AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT SACKS STATE HE MET HER. AND HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO BE A POLICE OFFICER WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO STUDY EARLY EDUCATION AND NOT CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND SHE SAYS WELL BECAUSE I MEAN WORKING WITH PEOPLE. AND I WONDER UNDERSTAND PEOPLE SO I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER ME WE NEED MORE PEOPLE STUDYING. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PSYCHOLOGY SOCIAL WORK ETHNIC STUDIES- BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA LEARN THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE STUFF IN THE ACADEMY SO. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S AN ISSUE AS FAR AS WHAT YOUR DEGREE IS I WOULD THINK THAT. YOU KNOW LEARNING. ABOUT THE HUMAN ELEMENT BECAUSE LET'S FACE AND OF THE POLICE. THAT PEOPLE ARE RISK. TO ARE ABOUT HUMAN CRISIS SO MUCH. YOU KNOW HE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALLS AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND PEOPLE AND THAT IS WAY MORE. OF THE ISSUE FOR CALLS FOR SERVICE. THEN ALWAYS TACTICAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES- SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST ABOUT SOMETHING I ALWAYS. WONDER IT IS SHOULD THAT BE A PRIORITY AS WELL MAYBE YOU CAN. UPON ON THAT. BUT BUT THE OTHER THE BIG QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK IN OF COURSE TODAY. WE'RE NOT WRITING BILLS WERE NOT MAKING LAWS WERE UNDERSTANDING. SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS OUT THERE. THAT MAYBE IT IT'LL BILL. THAT SOME CITIES ALREADY DO SO MY UNDERSTANDING HERE AT SAC CITY AS OUR TEAM SAID. WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU MUST HAVE AN EIGHT AND A. EIGHT DEGREE. TO ENTER THE ACADEMY AND THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SHERIFF. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT JUST- YOU HAVE TO BE EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE. AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN AS WE SAID EARLIER. THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER AND HAVE MORE EDUCATION. HAVE BETTER RESULTS IN THE FIELD AND LAST- UNLESS PROBLEMS- SO. SHOULD WE HAVE. AN AGE REQUIREMENT. AND SHOULD WE HAVE. AN EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT A. STATE WIDE STANDARD- THOSE ARE MY FIRST QUESTIONS THANK YOU. CHIEF OR WHOEVER WANTS TO RESPOND. I GUESS I'LL GO FIRST- SO YEAH I THINK THAT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN WHETHER IT'S AGE REQUIREMENT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD IF THAT WAS TO MOVE TO SAY TWENTY FIVE AND SWITCH FROM HAVING A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR GED TO A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHICH WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR MOST DEPARTMENTS. OURS WE LIKE I SAID WE REQUIRE TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE I THINK WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND SO WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THAT- NO LIKE I SAID I START AT NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND NOW I'VE DONE THIRTY THREE YEARS AND I'M THE POLICE CHIEF CHAU. IF I WAS REQUIRED TO BE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE I WOULD NEVER. AND IT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT GROUPS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO RECRUIT BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO GET THEM AT A VERY EARLY AGE. IN JOBS THAT MANY OF THE LIKE THIS- SOME OF THOSE JOBS LIKE STUDENT TRAINEE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO GO TO COLLEGE TO MAINTAIN THE JOB. SO I THINK THE EDUCATION WISE- I REALLY LIKE WHERE WE'RE AT WITH TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE I DO THINK EDUCATION MAKES A DIFFERENCE. BUT YOU SEE MOST OF OUR OFFICERS ESPECIALLY ONCE HIRED IN THE LAST TEN FIFTEEN YEARS. VAST MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE BACHELOR'S DEGREES THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY STARTED WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. BUT WE OFFER INCENTIVE PAY. FOR BACHELOR'S DEGREES SO THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO GET TO THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT MIGHT WORK BETTER. IN THIS PROFESSION AND FOR US YOU GET- MORE PAY IF YOU HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE SO. YOU MIGHT NOT START WITH ONE BUT THEN YOU'LL GET ONE TO. ONE OF THE REASONS BEING YOU WANT MORE PAY. CHECK CAN I ALSO WAY I'M SORRY. PLEASE OUR- A COUPLE OF PUBLIC COMMENTS- IT WHICH QUESTION I ALSO CONCORD THE NEED FOR MINIMUM IF YOU CAN BACKUP YOUR DISCUSSION AS TO WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE ALREADY MENTIONED BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS PANEL ARE WE NOT CONSISTENTLY ONE MAJOR INDICATOR OUR SUCCESSFUL POLICING IF I'M STOP REDUCTION IN POLICE CITIZEN COMPLAINTS IS EDUCATION ABOUT HOUSE OR LISTENING VERY CONSISTENT- YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT. AND WE HAVE ALSO NOTICED I KNOW I'D THIS MOMENT WHERE WHERE IN OUR- WE ALSO WANT TO KIND OF MESS WHERE WE WHERE- EVEN YOU KNOW TWENTY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO THE COMPANY SENDS ALL OF THE THINGS WE KNOW HALF WALK HALF MAKE PROGRESS AND EDUCATION CONSISTENTLY ASKING MODEL IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THESE QUESTIONS ARE OF COURSE FULLY I'M I'M FAIRLY WHICH WE KNOW IS 90% OF TIME WHAT POLICE OFFICERS DO TO BE ABLE TO ATTACK WITH EMPATHY MOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE. CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING. ALSO TO MY TO ARGUE NO COMMENT AND IT WAS OF HOW. WHAT THAT. MINIMUM EDUCATION WHO LOOKS LIKE OR IF WALKER I AGREE WITH SOME MEMBER AT MCCARTY ARE REPRESENTED- THAT DOESN'T HAVE BE CRIMINALS- I'M AND- IT COULD ANY OTHER MEMBER OF YOUR- THINK SEASON.

MULTI DISCIPLINARY OP YOU KNOW AFTER I'M ONE BACK WE DEFINITELY RIGHT MY VERY PROUD OF I I'M I'M- GONNA STUDENTS TO CALL FROM ARE BACK IF NEXT. SO WHAT I SPOKE ABOUT SOME. FINALLY I WITH ARE BASED FACING RESPECT HOW KIND REALLY POP NICE THE SUN CLUB FOR TWELVE JUST. I THOUGHT ACCOUNTABILITY. IS BROKEN- THE BASE POLICE OFF WOULD ALWAYS HAVE TO BE IN.

THERE'S WAYS YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT I THINK- HARMING THE DIVERSITY. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS I THINK EVERYTHING'S ON THE TABLE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS DISCUSSION- WE'RE NOT- CONCLUDING OR- ARE ARE ARE CREATING ANY KIND OF- POSITION ON ANY. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IT'S ABOUT DIALOGUE WE HAVE THAT DIALOGUE HERE TODAY A VERY GOOD HAPPY. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF TORRENTE OF EXPERTS- LENDING THEIR VOICES IN THIS AREA SO NEXT UP WE HAVE MISS RUBIO. MISSED GONZALEZ AND IN MR LACKEY. THANK YOU MISTER DIPS- WILL FIRST OF. THANK FOR OF FOR ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL- APPRECIATE ALL OF THE DISCUSSION- I WOULD DIE. WANT TO JOIN JUST JUMP IN I. GREW UP IN DOWNTOWN LA SPECIFICALLY IN THE PICO UNION. AREA OF LOS ANGELES I VENTURE TO SAY BY FAR THE MOST DANGEROUS- AREA IF NOT JUST IN THE COUNTY BUT IN THE STATE I AND I AM CONCERNED I WITH THE- EDUCATION COMPONENT OF THIS- WHEN I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE AND MY COUNSELOR ESSENTIALLY SAID- AND I WON'T BE SPECIFIC BUT DATA. SAID THAT I WAS NOT I SHOULD NOT GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE I WAS ONLY GOING TO GET MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HE SAID I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN- BECAUSE I'M A LATINO OR BOTH- AND SO. I SEE THAT I ALSO TO REITERATE I THE FACT THAT A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE OF POLICE OFFICERS THAT LOOK LIKE THEM. AND I IN MY CASE AND- WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE PEOPLE UNION AREA OF DOWNTOWN LA I DIDN'T SEE MANY. SAFETY PERSONNEL OR POLICE OFFICERS THAT LOOKED LIKE ME NOW AND I USE THE EXAMPLE OF. HOW I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE AND WAS TOLD THAT I WAS THAT I SHOULDN'T BECAUSE I SHOULD. ACTUALLY JUST GOING TO HOME ECONOMICS BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO GET MARRIED HAVE CHILDREN- THAT STOP ME FOR THE TEMPORARY LEAVE FROM FROM GETTING AN EDUCATION. AND WHEN WE ARE REQUIRING. MORE EDUCATION IF THE PHONE EXAMPLE IS A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. FROM OUR POLICE OFFICERS LESS AND LESS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE ME IF WE DON'T CHANGE THE EDUCATIONAL POLICIES WITHIN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM AS WELL. TO ENCOURAGE NOT DISCOURAGE- MINORITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR TO GO TO SCHOOL NOW I KNOW THAT THAT FOR ME IT WASN'T IN THE FIFTIES IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND THINGS HAVE CHANGED I HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY BUT I VENTURE TO SAY THAT THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF- ACADEMICS BUT STILL FEEL THAT MINORITIES SHOULD NOT- OR CAN NOT NOT THAT SHOULD NOT THEY CANNOT ATTAIN. ARE THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION THAT YOU KNOW OTHER PEOPLE CAN UNTIL WE CAN FIX THAT. WE'RE NOT ENCOURAGING FOLKS- THAT LOOK LIKE ME TO GOING TO. A POLICE WORK FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT I TO YOUR- COLLEGE DEGREE AND THAT SOUNDS. THAT SOUNDS GREAT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT I WAS A TEACHER- ERRAND I DID NOT HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL WHEN I STARTED TEACHING I WAS HIRED UNDER THE- THE- EMERGENCY PERMIT. AND WAS ALLOWED TO TEACH I'M GOING TO COOK THE GO TO SCHOOL I TO OBTAIN MY CREDENTIAL- AND THERE ARE LIKE CHEAP HAN SAID- IN THE TEACHING WORLD WE DO HAVE INCENTIVES TO CONTINUE OUR EDUCATION ON A GIVE YOU EXAMPLE. THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT IS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IF YOU WANT TO MOVE UP IN THE PAY SCALE THEN YOU CONTINUE EITHER GET A MASTER'S DEGREE OR CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION AND YOUR PAID. PAID TO- BASED ON THAT- THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE ABOUT THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SHUTTING PEOPLE OUT THAT LOOK LIKE AS- TO BE- WITHIN THE COMMUNITY- AS A TEACHER WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM TEACHERS THE TEACHING COMMUNITY HAS THE SAME ISSUES. THERE'S NOT VERY MANY I TEACHERS THAT LOOK LIKE THOSE STUDENTS THAT THE TEACHERS SPECIFICALLY THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN WE'RE PUTTING THESE REQUIREMENTS. THAT WE DON'T DISENFRANCHISE ALREADY A COMMUNITY ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISENFRANCHISED AS IT IS AND NOT ENCOURAGED TO GO TO SCHOOL NOT ENCOURAGED TO GET A DEGREE. BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE US- THAT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND I USE THE EXAMPLE OF ME. LIVING IN DOWNTOWN LA I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE ISSUES AND M. BOTH COMMUNITIES ARE FAR BEYOND WHAT A DEGREE CAN TEACH YOU. YOU NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE AS TO THE POINT I THINK I HEARD YOU FOUND ALSO SAY THAT. THE EXPERIENCE IS ALSO A FACTOR THE EXPERIENCE FIRST OF ALL OF BEING A LESBIAN OR A BLACK. PERSON CAN ONLY COME FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING THE SAME EXAMPLES ARE LIVING THE SAME. ISSUES THAT- THAT ARE WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES I. HAVE ABOUT ME LIVING IN DOWNTOWN BUT HAVE NEVER SHARED THAT- ONE OF MY COUSINS WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD. AND PASS BECAUSE SHE WAS INVOLVED IN GANGS AND DRUGS- SO I HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES EVEN WHEN I SIT UP HERE AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THE- CONVERSATIONS. THAT THAT- BASICALLY ARE. BACK AND FORTH WITH THEM ARE JUST THE- COMMUNITY UP IN SACRAMENTO ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES THAT ARE HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AND I TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE I. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT YES WE SHOULD HAVE A MINIMUM. REQUIREMENT I ALSO DID I MENTION THAT I WORKED FOR THE CITY OF VERNON AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND PART OF MY JOB WAS TO DO THE TESTING FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND FOR PROMOTIONS. SO I'VE HAD THOSE EXPERIENCES AND I THINK WE CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT CAN CAN A SUPPORT THOUGH THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT WANT TO- BECOME POLICE OFFICERS. BECAUSE WE NEED PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE US ON THE GROUND TRYING TO HELP THE COMMUNITY- LEFT WE HAVE TO LIFT THEIR COMMUNITIES AND UNLESS WE UNLESS WE LIFT THEM UP WE CANNOT. HAVE IN A CONVERSATION- AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN TEACH US WHAT THEY NEED OR WHAT WE NEED ON THE GROUND- I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION- BUT I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THAT AS A TEACHER- WE ARE. ORIGINALLY GIVEN THE PRINT WHAT WE CALL A PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL THE PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL IS IF YOU MAKE THE BUT YOU MEET THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS- IT'S YOU WE HAVE A PRELIMINARY COULD ENTER FOR FIVE YEARS AND WITHIN THOSE FIVE YEARS OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE FULFILLED IN ORDER. FOR US TO GET A CLICK WHAT WE CALL A CLEAR CUT THEIR CREDENTIAL BASICALLY THAT'S- ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS RENEW IT FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES AND CONNECT AND CAN KEEP IT. AND THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE ADDITIONAL EDUCATION AND SO IF WE CAN HAVE A SYSTEM- THAT THAT- CAN REFLECT WHAT THE TEACHING COMMUNITY DOES I THINK WE CAN. YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE POLICE OFFICERS AND PEOPLE IN OUT SAFETY POSITION TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE QUALITIES THAT THAT- YOU KNOW WE WERE DISCUSSING. BUT WE ALSO NEED IN MID TO MAKE IT- FAIR FOR PUT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO BE ABLE TO APPLY TO BE POLICE OFFICERS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE COMMUNITY. OUR OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS THAT LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNITY THERE WERE ALWAYS SPEAKING DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND I. AM AFRAID THAT IF WE PUT MORE REQUIREMENTS INSTEAD OF FACILITATING- YOU KNOW ARE YOU ARE HELPING THOSE FOLKS THAT WANT TO BECOME POLICE OFFICERS. GET THROUGH SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE REPRESENTED BY FOUGHT BY FOLKS THAT LOOK LIKE THEMSELVES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS GONZALEZ. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T I DON'T KNOW- IF ANY OF THE PANELS COULD ANSWER IT FIRST QUESTION IS. IS THE USE OF FORCE ISSUES THAT WERE SEEN IS IT PRIMARILY WITH NEW OFFICERS OR OFFICERS WHO HAVE- BEEN ON THE FORCE FOR AWHILE. BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSION OF COURSES- ABOUT TRAINING OF INCOMING OFFICERS BUT IF WE HAVE A CULTURAL PROBLEM OR PROBLEM THAT EXISTED ACT. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THIS WOULD NECESSARILY FIX THAT. THE MYSTERY. MYSTERY A OUR CHIEF OF CHIEF. YOU HAN I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION WITH US SOME YOU KNOW ON ON THE TENURE OF THESE OFFICERS OFFICERS INVOLVED IN USE OF FORCE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO. THANK THE ACT EXACT STATS IN FRONT OF ME BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD THERE'S VETERAN OFFICERS YOUNGER OFFICERS SO- IT IT RUNS THE GAMUT. IF I MAY I THINK I WILL I WILL CONCORD THEY STUDIES SEEM TO GET AND OF COURSE THERE MAY BE VARIATIONS FROM DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT CHIEF ARNOLDI FIVE TO YOU AND IF YES WHAT. ARE THE FOSTER ARE FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS- OFF OFFICE THAT'S GONNA COME BACK WE'LL KEEP. OUR HEADS TO BE MUCH MORE CHALLENGING ON HIGHER RATES ARE YOU STUDENTS ON OFTENTIMES IF YOU'RE TRACKING AGAIN ACCORDING TO THE STUDIES DONE A QUITE A BIT OF TIME. YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO KEEP THEIR DOORS ONCE IF NOT PROPERLY TAUGHT THAT PRODUCTIVITY IS TAKING BACK BECOME A PROBLEM. HOUSE NONTON GET ON THE LINE. I IF I MAY ALSO ON THE LIST MIGHT BE TO KITCHEN AGAIN WHICH WE KNOW IS THAT CONTENT INDICATOR. OVER THE DISCUSSIONS CARE INCLUDE. IF YOU GET PROGRAMS WHAT IT MEANS WE TALK ABOUT THAT BILL IS WALKING PRESENCE YOU WRESTLING PROFIT. CURRENTLY ACROSS MY ONE THOUGHT UP WITH OFFICER THAT'S NOT THE COUNTRY HOW ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW BACHELOR'S DEGREE. BUT IT'S NOT ON TO HAVE WHAT IS POLICE ASKS WITH MASTER FROM SOUND LOG PLEASE ARE IN FIRST I KNOW I'M TO AS AN INDICATOR I THE BLACK AS WELL IN TERMS OF CREATING A CEASE OF EDUCATION TO WITH IT WITHOUT WITH TRYING TO BRING IN. I'M ALSO GRATEFUL TO FACT THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE CHIEF HANDLE. NOT HAND ABOUT DEGREE AND- MY NAME IN THE FORCE OUT OF STOCK ON THE I'VE COME EVEN HIGHER LEVELS YEP RIGHT CONCEPT. BUT WE CAN LOSE OUR ARE NOT ALLOWED REFORM TO NEXT THAT WE TO THAT IS SPECIAL IF IT TIME WHEN THEY IS DIFFICULT FOR QUICKLY OFTEN TEN TO BE THOSE FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PROPER OR WHAT'S TO BRING AND VERY MUCH. INTO THE SYSTEM PAIN THEM GIVING THEM A JOB I'M PAYING THEM FOR TRAINING AND CONTINUING THAT TRAINING THROUGH- SO THAT YOU ALMOST ARE ARE. BEGIN TO BE CREDENTIALED- IF YOU WELL AS A POLICE OFFICER OUR PEACE OFFICER- IN THE SAME THOUGHT ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DROPPING OUT OF OR OR BEING KICKED OUT OF THE ACADEMY. IF THEY COULD STILL GET INTO THE SYSTEM CONTINUE TO DO THE TRAINING- BEING PAID AS AN EMPLOYEE- DOING THE TYPE OF WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO DO AS THEIR SKILLS INCREASE IN OTHER AREAS. ARE THERE ANY KIND OF PROGRAMS LIKE THAT READ I DON'T THINK WE MEDIATION BUT ALMOST- ENSURING THAT THAT WE GET PEOPLE INTO THE SYSTEM THAT WE WANT WE WANT A PEACE A POLICE FORCE IT LOOKS LIKE OUR COMMUNITY THAT REFLECTS OUR COMMUNITY THAT COMES FROM OUR COMMUNITY. GETTING THOSE WHO ARE ARE ARE QUALIFIED TO BEGIN WITH INTO THE SYSTEM I'M GIVING THEM A JOB I MEAN I AGREE THAT IF YOU MAKE PEOPLE WAIT FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS- TO CLEAR. SOMETHING OR OR ANOTHER OR YOU PUT THEM THROUGH THE ACADEMY AND THEN THEY GET KICKED OUT OF ME NOT THAT THERE GOES ALL YOUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS BUT- I'M GETTING THEM IN AND THEN DOING SOME OF THE TRAINING AND SOME OF THE- EXPERTISE. AFTER THE FACT HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND OF PROGRAM LIKE THAT HAS CANNOT WORK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOT GONZALEZ I. ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID- AND LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT HOW WE DO THAT HERE SO. ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF CREATING THESE ENTRY LEVEL JOBS IS OUT ONE IF YOU APPLY STRAIGHT AS A POLICE OFFICER TO SAY. WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES IN OUR YOUTH SO SAY YOU HAVE SOME MISTAKES IN YOUR BACKGROUND THAT NORMALLY WE WOULDN'T PUT YOU IN THE ACADEMY. BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE YOU THINK YOU COULD VERY WELL BEAN AMAZING OFFICER. WILL HIRE YOU AS A COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICER. WHICH IS A FULL TIME POSITION SO. WE CAN SEE YOUR PERFORMANCE AND SEE IF WHAT I BELIEVE IN YOU IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE OVER SAY SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. AND SHOULD YOU PERFORM REALLY WELL AND- AND SHOW THAT THOSE MISTAKES ARE IN THE PAST THEN WE PUT YOU IN THAT CATEGORY. SAME WITH THE PEOPLE THAT- YOU TALK ABOUT THAT WE KICKED OUT ACADEMY ONE WE'VE SOLVED A LOT OF THAT WITH THE PRE ACADEMY AND OTHER TRAINING BEFORE YOU EVER GET THE ACADEMY. BUT IF YOU ARE STILL SOMEBODY THAT WE BELIEVE HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL WE PUT YOU BACK IN THE ACADEMY. OR THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT GO THROUGH THE WHOLE COUNTY THEY PASS ALL THE TRAINING. BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE QUITE READY TO BE A POLICE OFFICER. SO WHEN THEY GRADUATE WE MAKE THEM A COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICER SO THEY GET MORE EXPERIENCE. AND THEN WHEN THEY GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE THINK THEY CAN HANDLE THE RIGORS OF BEING A POLICE OFFICER THEN WE UPGRADE THEM TO PLACE ALSO. YES THERE'S MANY WAYS WE DO THAT WHETHER THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT HAS SOME ISSUES. THAT WE THINK HAVE POTENTIAL OR SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT PASSED THE TEST. WE CAN PUT THEM BACK. IN THE KASHMIR GIVE THEM ANOTHER JOB. IF I COULD JUST ADD ON. IS ONE PROGRAM. THAT DEALS. WITH I THINK THE- PART OF QUESTION. WHICH IS- AN LAPD IT'S KNOWN AS THE POLICE OFFICER PREPARATION PROGRAM. WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THE GAP BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE AGE OF- THE MINIMUM AGE TO COME A POLICE OFFICER OR WHAT IT IS A PROGRAM- IN CONJECTURE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY OBTAIN A- AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE. AND THEY ALSO LEARN ABOUT POLICING AND IT'S A IT'S A WAY TO BRIDGE THAT GAP. PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EDUCATION IT'S LARGELY- WITH STUDENTS WHO WERE FROM MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND IT'S A WAY TO GET THEM INTO POLICING WHETHER IT'S WITH THE ONLY. OTHER AGENCIES AND I THINK THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE KEY TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT IN ANY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IMPOSED IS THAT PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE. AND HAVE A PATHWAY TO AN EDUCATION AND TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. JUST AS THE MILITARY DOES JUST AS MANY AGENCIES ON THEIR OWN HAVE DONE. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING ON A STATEWIDE BASIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE RELY ON THE FORWARD LOOKING LEADERSHIP OF CHIEF HAN AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS. TO TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO MAKE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND YOU END UP WITH A PATCHWORK OF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITH DIFFERENT STANDARDS DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS. AND IF WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION CAN HELP US IN MAKING BETTER POLICE OFFICERS ARE ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES. EVERY COMMUNITY DESERVES THE QUALITY OF THOSEOFFICERS AND SO A STATEWIDE MANDATE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT IT NEEDS TO BE MEASURED IT NEEDS TO BE COMPREHENSIVE AND IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. WITH THE FULL RESOURCES. NECESSARY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISS GONZALEZ WE WANNA GO TO MR. LACKEY AND ALSO MR BONTA. AND THEN WE SEEM IS FAISON WHO ACT- WILL CERTAINLY GET TO YOU AND HAVE BEEN A BRIEF MOMENT SO WITH THAT MR LACKEY. YEAH THANK YOU I'LL BE. VERY VERY QUICK I. I WANT TO SAY THAT I WAS THANKFUL TO HAVE A- MET WITH- CHIEF ONE ABOVE I'M SURE HE PROBABLY DOESN'T REMEMBER BUT I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO MEET HIM AND HIS OFFICE TO DISCUSS THE SUDBURY PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND TRYING TO INTEGRATE MORE PEOPLE OF MINORITY STATUS AND HE INDICATED TO ME THAT THE SUCCESS AND FILL RATES A LEARNING DOMAINS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN AND MINORITY GROUPS WERE ALL RELATED AT LEAST PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE HAVING DRIVING PROBLEMS AND SHOOTING PROBLEMS AND SHALL. WE- TOOK THAT INFORMATION AND WE- HAVE CRAFTED LEGISLATION AND YOU CAN LOOK IT UP AND SAY ME THREE THREE TWO IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WHICH REQUIRES OPPOSED TO PUBLISH A STUDY ON REMEDIATION STANDARDS BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A VERY CRITICAL AN EASY FIX IF WE JUST TO. ALLOW MORE ATTENTION AND ESPECIALLY THESE OF FOLKS THAT THE THEIR CULTURE HAS NOT PREPARED THEM. IN THE SAME WAY MANY OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE HAD THAT PREPARATION ON SHOOTING AND DRIVING AND SO VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT AND THE STUDY SHOULD THE COME OUT IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR FORWARD THE- MAKING AND THE PRE KATAMON THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHED. OF THOSE ISSUES ARE VERY VERY VERY POWERFUL AND I THINK- WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK TO- FINDING SOME REMEDY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE LOOK FORWARD FOR THAT STUDY TO COME OUT I WE HAVE MR BONTA THAT WILL GO RIGHT TO MRS BASED ON WHO IS PART OF THE PRESENTATIONS BEFORE MR BONTA YOU'RE UP TO BAT. THIS IS CERTAINLY BEEN A VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION SO I APPRECIATE. YES YEAH THANK YOU- MISTER SHARON THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE I PARTICIPATING IN THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AND I DEFINITELY AM HEARING- I HAVE A RIGHTFUL DESIRE TO HAVE WAVED AT DIVERSE A LAW ENFORCEMENT- FOCUSED WORKFORCE THAT REFLECTS THAT I DUTIFUL DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT- FOR MEETING THE STANDARDS THE HIGH STANDARDS AND TRAINING. WHAT IT HOW DO WE STRIKE THAT BALANCE HOW DO WE HOW DO WE WHAT'S THE SINGLE- MOST IMPACTFUL THINGS A LEGISLATURE COULD DO OR POLICY MAKING BODY STATEWIDE IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP ACHIEVE THAT RESULT- THAT- EIGHT HIGHLY TRAINED- POLICE FORCE THAT MEETS THE HIGH STANDARDS- THAT LOOKS LIKE CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S THE KIND ABOUT THAT'S ABOUT TO TRYING TO GET AND- WHAT INTERVENTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO GET THAT. GREAT THANK VERY MUCH- CHIEF POND OR- ANY OF OUR PRESENTERS YOU WANT TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT. THE QUESTION. BUT DIVERSITY I THINK THE CHIFFONS SACRAMENTO IS CERTAINLY WORKING TOWARDS THAT REGARD- CHIEF HAN ARE YOU STILL WITH US- WHAT WELL BUT OKAY OR MYSTERY. HE FROM STILL. YEAH IT IS JUST AS GOOD YOU KNOW WE REALLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT. PEOPLE FACE SUCH AS SHOOTING AND DRIVING IT FOR THE POST AND THE POST STANDARDS ARE THE POST MINIMUMS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AT THE AT THE THAT'S FINE RANGE WE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT EVOLVED. TO COMPENSATE FOR- THE GENERATIONS COMING IN THAT HAVE BEEN HANDLED FIREARMS OR HABITS- DRIVEN THEIR CARS IS OFTEN AND- AS LONG AS THEY THEY SHOULD HAVE THE PRODUCTS COMING LEASE DEPARTMENT- SO REALLY. RAISING THIS RAISING THE TRAINING STANDARDS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE TO HELP COMPENSATE FOR THOSE DEFICIENCIES AT THOSE AREAS- FORTY HOURS REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH TO REALLY- EIGHT INDOCTRINATE SOMEBODY ELSE HOW TO HANDLE FIREARM THE SHOTGUN AND EIGHT EXTENDED IMPACT WEAPON. THAT'S REALLY A LOT TO CONGRESS TO COMPREHEND AND UNDERSTAND IT TO BE PROFICIENT AT IT ALSO INCREASING THE TIME TRAINING THE CONTINENT TRAINING AND ALSO REALLY THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IS THE PRACTICE THE CRITICAL MINDSET COORDINATE RESPONSE PRACTICAL EXERCISES. THAT OFFICERS CAN. IT INVOLVED WORKING IN TEAMS- THOSE LEVELS OF TRAINING DATA I REALLY THINK ARE HELPFUL FOR ESPECIALLY FOR OFFICERS IS BEING ABLE FOR THEM TO. EXPERIENCE THOSE IN NOW REAL REALITY BASED TRAINING IT'S NOT SERIAL UNCLES CALLED REALITY BASED TRAINING BASED ON OUR USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE CAN CREATE. WELL REALLY STRANGE THAT OFFICERS CAN REVISIT THOSE DEEP X. EXPERIENCE IT WELL YOU BRIEF THOSE SITUATIONS AND REALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THOSE EXPERIENCES WHEN- AND REALLY USING FORCE OPTIONS AS A AND CRITICAL CRITICAL THINKING AS PART OF OUR TRAINING CURRICULUM. SO IF WE RAISE THE LEVEL TRAINING. I THINK THAT BE HELPFUL. IN THIS GOES TO THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE- TWENTY FIVE IS AN AGE BUT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF MATURITY THAT PEOPLE COME INTO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND REALLY THERE'S A BALANCE OF HOW DO WE GET THE RIGHT CANDIDATES DIVERSE CANDIDATES WITHOUT. IMPACTING CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WHO DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTAIN THEIR EDUCATION- ALSO SAN FRANCISCO. IN ONE OF OUR PAST RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE- WAS AT. THE ACADEMY IS OURS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS CLOSE TO EIGHT MONTHS. SO USING THOSE. USING CREEK ON THE CLOTHES CURRICULUM IN TRANSLATING THOSE INTO COLLEGE CREDITS. AND HAVING ARE HAVING OUR POLICE RECRUITS THEN APPLY THOSE CREDITS TOWARD A DEGREE. I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. THAT THAT HELPS OUR MEMBERS. AND SEEKING THEIR EDUCATIONAL. DESIRES AND GOALS EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY GROWING UP- COMMITTEE CENTER. AND IT SOUNDS AS THEY FACED. THANK YOU. LET ME IF I FIND A- YEAH CHIEF ALL UP THANK YOU- SORRY CONTACT YOU OFF. YES YOU IN MY UPPER A- SOUTHERN ONE OUT YOU'VE GOT GO AHEAD PLEASE PROCEED AND THEN WE'LL JUST TALK YEAH I THINK WE ALL WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S CERTAIN SEGMENTS THAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BECOME. POLICE OFFICERS WITH THE EXPERIENCE IS THE FIRST EXPERIENCE WE WANT THEY THEY HAVE A CERTAIN FEELING ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT LIKE THE REST OF OUR COMMUNITY I DON'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S- SO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND WE HAVE TO DO IT MUCH YOUNGER AND SO I'VE MENTIONED MANY OF THE ENTRY LEVEL PROGRAMS WE DO BUT WE ALSO HAVE. FOR PROGRAM TO INNER CITY HIGH SCHOOLS FOR YOUR PROGRAM FOR THE STUDENTS ARE WITH US I USED TO RUN ONE AT GRANT HIGH SCHOOL- AND WE HAVE WE JUST HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SO WE WORK WITH THAT- SEVERAL HUNDRED TEENS THAT ARE IN A GROUP CALLED IMPACTS ACT. AND THEY CAME UP WITH A PROGRAM WHERE WE'VE NOW PUT LIKE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS THROUGH IT WHERE THEY HAVE AN EXPERIENCE AT THE ACADEMY THAT LASTS ABOUT HALF A DAY THEN WE EAT LUNCH TOGETHER AND WE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS SO WE REALLY JUST HAVE TO START ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF DISTRESSED. AND NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR YOUNGER PEOPLE AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO DO THAT AND PART OF THAT IS ASKING YOUNG PEOPLE HOW CAN WE DO THAT AND SO THAT PROGRAM I MENTIONED AT THE ACADEMY THAT CAME FROM THE IMPACTS ACT YOU HAVE THE ONES THAT CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA AND NOW WE'VE HAD PUT SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE. THANK. YOU VERY MUCH DOCTORS OTHERS. GANTI FONG MY FAULT. UP I JUST WANNA SAY CHEAPER REALLY ARE. WELL BRING THAT YOUNGER DEMO EXTREME IMPORTANT I THINK WE HAVE CAREER DAYS AT SCHOOLS AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS I KNOW WHEN I WAS ASSISTANT CHIEF WE WENT OUT WITH OUR UNITS TO THE SCHOOL THAT OUR CANINES AND OTHER SPECIALIZED UNITS. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IT WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN POLICE OFFICERS SANTA MONICA WHO RECRUITED ME TO SMPTE I GOT RECRUITED THE F. B. I. BY TWO BLACK AGENTS. I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT NOW 61% AND SPENT. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM MY TEACHING A GRADUATE SCHOOL AT USC. MANY OF MY STUDENTS AFTER YOU GET THEIR MASTERS IN PUBLIC POLICY THEY'RE STUDYING CLASS. WITH LAUNCH FORTH RASS LOOSELY LARGELY FROM LAPD WORKING ON MASTER'S DEGREES. LAST YEAR I HAD THREE OF MY STUDENTS GRADUATE IN MAY WITH MASTERS. AND APPLIED THE LAPD SO IT'S INTERACTION I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WITH PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE YOU. TALK TO YOU COME FROM YOUR COMMUNITIES. AND YOU SAY WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THAT JOB THOSE CONVERSATIONS RELATIONSHIPS START. AND I THINK AGAIN TO THE CHIEF'S COMMENTS WE HAVE TO START MUCH YOUNGER. AND ENGAGE PEOPLE A LOT MORE POSITIVELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH- DOCTORS OTHERS WHAT WE WANT TO MOVE TO MISS FAISON. WE WANNA CHECK ONE MOMENT GET YOUR MICROPHONE OPENED. ARE WE CAN HAVE YOU COME BACK IS THAT READY. DOES IT WORK YES OKAY WE GOT YOU THINK SO I WANTED TO ADDRESS- THERE WAS A QUESTION THREE QUESTIONS AGO THAT WAS IT ENDED WITH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO SPEAKING ON HER EXPERIENCE IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO ADDRESS- SO I HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE INHIGH SCHOOL MY COUNSELOR DISCOURAGED ME HE WASN'T SO BLATANT TO SAY THAT HE THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE CHILDREN AND JUST YOU KNOW WHATEVER BUT- HE WAS HE DID DISCOURAGE ME FROM ATTENDING COLLEGE AND ENCOURAGED ME TO DO R. O. P. INSTEAD. AND SAID THAT YOU KNOW HE USED THE FACT THAT IT BE QUICKER TO GET THROUGH IT AND YOU KNOW SO FORTH AND SO ON. AND THAT CREATED- ME HAVING-TO GO TO JUNIOR COLLEGE AND START FROM THE LOWER LEVEL CLASSES TO GET THROUGH TO EVEN START TAKING COLLEGE REQUIRED CLASSES- SO THAT EXPERIENCE. IS COMMON IT'S NOT UNCOMMON SO I WANTED TO SAY ALSO THAT I AGREE THAT I AM IT'S A LITTLE BIT BOTHERING TO HEAR ABOUT AN EDUCATION REQUIREMENT- I'M SAD THAT MCCARTY LEAVING BECAUSE I'M GOING TO REFERENCE HIS STATEMENT AS WELL- BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE CENTERED AROUND EDUCATION JUST BECAUSE IT DOES. DISENFRANCHISE A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT ALSO IT DOES ANOTHER THING IT THE FOLKS THAT ARE NOT IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE DETACHED ALREADY FROM OUR COMMUNITIES. PUTTING THEM INTO A COLLEGE AND GIVING THEM COLLEGE LEVEL CLASSES IS GOING TO FURTHER DO YOU CATCH THEM FROM THE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES. SO THOSE ARE TWO WAYS I FEEL THAT IT HARMS BUT EVEN IF WE DO LOOK AT EDUCATION AND IT DOES BECOME IMPLEMENTED. WHAT MCCARTY SAID IS TAKING COLLEGE COURSES ARE HAVING TO GREASE THAT ARE IN- STUDIES THAT ARE EITHER SOCIAL SCIENCE STUDIES OR STUDIES THAT TEACH PEOPLE TO TEACH YOU HOW TO LEARN ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN AND- HUMAN- ACTIONS. THAT WOULD BE ENCOURAGED YOU KNOW MAYBE WHILE SOMEBODY IS ALSO BEING A POLICE OFFICER GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO- GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY BE EDUCATED IN PAYING FOR THEIR EDUCATION- THAT'S THAT'S ALWAYS A PLUS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY SO. THAT'S GOOD BUT I ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY AND WITH BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IN PLACE EVEN IF WE CREATE THE BEST. YOU KNOW REFORM TO. REQUIRE THAT THESE THINGS TAKE PLACE. THERE'S STILL A POLICE CULTURE. THAT IS PROBLEMATIC AND SO YOU CAN GET. ALL THE DIVERSITY THAT YOU WANT INTO A POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND YOU CAN EDUCATE PEOPLE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO BUT IT COULD ALSO BUILD SOMETHING. REALLY BAD IF YOU HAVE A CULTURE OF POLICING. THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN PROBLEMATIC PROBLEMATIC AND EGOTISTICAL. SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- EXPRESSLY OF DIRECTING TOWARDS WHAT MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY SAID. ALSO WANT TO. THINK AGAIN A DEPUTY CHIEF- YOU FOR- REPRESENTS EVER SAN FRANCISCO AND ALSO- ADDRESSING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. I THINK AGAIN THIS CONVERSATION HAS ABSOLUTELY BEEN.

AND I SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT YOU ALL TALK ABOUT THAT I THINK THE INFORMATION MIGHT BE USEFUL WE WERE FUTURE DELIBERATIONS I WANTED TO I JUST QUICKLY TOUCH ON- ON THE RACE AND ETHNICITY IN THE GENDER OF THE CURRENT POLICE OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES- BASED ON THE LAST DISCUSSION. EIGHTY SIX IN AROUND THE NET PRESENT. EIGHTY SIX PER OF. SAUCE FARM. BY- RAY AND ETHNICITY JERRY BROWN MISLED BY. ONE THREE THREE FORTY ARROGANT. SIX ASIAN. LATINO.

ABOUT A MEDICAL SCREENING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENS ARE REQUIRED FOR ALL HIGHER STANDARDS LATERAL TRANSFERS GORDON WE HIRED INDIVIDUALS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- LACKEY MENTIONED EIGHTY THREE THIRTY TWO WE COLLECTED DATA ON NOW FOR ONE FULL YEAR ON ALL ACADEMY GRADUATES NOT TO DISTURB YOU BALK ON DRIVING TRAINING FIRM STRAIGHT. WE ALSO COLLECTED DATA ON. EXAMS PHYSICAL FITNESS EXAM IN THE SCENARIO TEST THAT REPORT WILL COME OUT BY APRIL AND IT'S BASED ON A HONOR GENDER AND RACE. NOW I WILL GET BACK TO ADD TO MY TOPIC WHICH IS. THREE IN THE INTEREST OF BREVITY AND KEEP FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT. MY PREPARED REMARKS WILL ONLY ADDRESS THE PEACE OFFICER POSITION- THE LIVER MY REMARKS IN THREE PARTS ENTRY LEVEL TRAINING. IN SERVICE TRAINING FOR EXISTING PERSONNEL AND POST TRAINING COURSE CERTIFICATION QUALITY CONTROL. IN REGARD TO ENTRY LEVEL TRAINING CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS WHO ARE IN THE POSITION OF POLICE OFFICER OR DEPUTY SHERIFF ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND WAS CALL THE REGULAR BASIC COURSE THREE RBC. PRIOR TO APPOINTMENT AS A PEACE OFFICER. MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE SOME FORM OF PREPARATORY TRAINING PRIOR TO THE RBC. ONE TWO THREE WEEKS UP WITH ONE AGENCY- PROVIDING THE FIVE WEEKS OF TRAINING I BELIEVE CHIEF HAHN REFERRED TO THAT IS A PRE ACADEMY AND THAT'S WITH OTHER AGENCIES ON. THIS PREPARATORY AFTER INCLUDES TREATMENT SUCH AS WELL WERE WRITING ADMINISTRATION RADIO USAGE AS A WHOLE FITNESS AND FIREARMS JUST TO NAME A FEW. COAST DOES NOT TRACK THIS INFORMATION. THE MINIMUM THE MINIMUM TRAINING HOURS FOR THE RBC IS ESTABLISHED BY POST SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR HOURS DELIVERED IN A SERIES OF FORTY THREE LEARNING DOMAINS LEARNING DOMAINS COVER SUCH TOPICS AS LEADERSHIP. PROFESSIONALISM AND ETHICS RAIMES AGAINST PERSON'S VEHICLE AND VEHICLE OPERATIONS. WE CONDUCT REGULAR UPDATES OF ALL THE LEARNING DOMAINS AS NECESSARY WHERE EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY WE UPDATED TWELVE LEARNING DOMAINS ADDED A TOTAL OF SIXTEEN HOURS OF NEW TRAINING. TO ENCOMPASS PRINCIPLE POLICING AN IMPLICIT BIAS INTO LEARNING DOMAIN THREE SPOKE POLICING IN THE COMMUNITY. AND DE ESCALATION AND LEARNING DOMAIN TWENTY USES FOR SOME DE ESCALATION. ADDITIONALLY THE POST COMMISSION RECENTLY ADDED ONE STANDARDIZED SCENARIO TEST ON THE TOPIC OF DE ESCALATE SHE- IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CATALANS HAVE THE ABILITY. TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING HOURS TO THE STANDARD CURRICULUM. THE CURRENT AVERAGE THE BASIC ACADEMY TRAINING IS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS WITH ONLY ONE ACADEMY RUNNING UNDER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS. SEVERAL ACADEMIES PROPER RATE AT OVER TWELVE HUNDRED HOURS. IN ONE ACADEMY OPERATES IS ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TRAINING HOURS. SIX COMPLETION OF THE BASIC ACADEMY IS NOT THE COMPLETION OF A THREE LEVEL DISASTER TRAINING. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE BASICALLY KADAM MEANS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED TO ENTER INTO FIELD TRAINING. WHICH IS THE SECOND CRITICAL PIECE OF ENTRY LEVEL TRAINING. ONLY BE SHERRY OFFICERS OR WHAT SOME CALL OSTER TRAINEES REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE POST. FILTERING PROGRAM WHICH CONSISTS OF A MINIMUM OF FOUR HUNDRED HOURS FOR TEN WEEKS OF ONE ON ONE TRAINING AND MENTORING. STANDARDIZED POSTVILLE TRAINING PROGRAMS ALL PROGRAM ALIGNED ACADEMY INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS INTO ON THE JOB TRAINING PROCESS. DESPITE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF FOUR HUNDRED HOURS THE MAJORITY OF FIELD TRAINING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AVERAGE BETWEEN- INSISTED USUALLY SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOURS OF FIELD TRAINING FOR SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN WEEKS. YES ENTRY LEVEL TRAINING FOR ALL PEACE OFFICERS IS A MINIMUM OF A THOUSAND SIXTY FOUR HOURS MADE UP OF THE SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR HOURS AND THE BASIC ACADEMY IN THE FOUR HUNDRED HOURS. OF FIELD TRAINING. UNLESS MOST DEPARTMENTS EXCEED TOTAL TRAINING TIME. OF A THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TRAINING HOURS. OF COMBINED BASICALLY ACADEMY INSTRUCTION IN FIELD TRAINING AND SOME DEPARTMENTS- APPROACHING TWO THOUSAND HOUSE. IF YOU'RE TRAINING PROGRAM IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES ONE ON ONE TRAINING. FIELD TRAINING OFFICER FOR SCO IS REQUIRED BY POST REGULATION TO COMPLETELY DALY OBSERVATION REPORT TO HELP TEACH VIA THE OFFICER TRAINEE PROGRESS AND BE ABLE TO MEET THE MINIMUM- COMPETENCIES. THIS REQUIRES A TOTAL OF EIGHTEEN CORE COMPETENCIES BE ADDRESSED DURING FIELD TRAINING. THINGS SUCH AS ETHICS TRAFFIC REPORT WRITING JUST TO NAME A FEW. THE POST FIELD TRAINING PROGRAMMING INCLUDES THE STANDARDIZED TEMPLATE FOR DEPARTMENTS TO FOLLOW AND IT ALLOWS DEPARTMENTS TO TAILOR THE TRAINING TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY THE LAST PART IS TO INCORPORATE LOCAL POLICY DISCUSSIONS INTO THE TRAINING CURRICULUM. I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE IS INTERESTED IN THE TRAINING. ENTRY LEVEL OFFICERS RECEIVED TO ENSURE INTEGRATION WITH THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. I WAY SOME EXAMPLES TO DEMNSTRATE HOW THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE BASED ECONOMY. LEARNING DOMAIN THREE POLICING IN THE COMMUNITY COVERS SIX OVERARCHING TOPICS. POLICING PARTNERSHIPS PROBLEM SOLVING PRINCIPLE POLICING HISTORICAL AND CURRENT EVENTS AND IMPLICIT BIAS IN LEARNING DOMAIN THIRTY CRIME SCENE AT CRIME SCENES AND EVIDENCE AND FORENSICS. TRAINEES MUST COMPLETE A LEARNING ACTIVITY ON HOW A PEACE OFFICER MAY COLLABORATE WITH THE COMMUNITY TO SOLVE A CRIME CAN IDENTIFY UNDERLYING CONDITIONS. ARE THEY CONTRIBUTE TO CRIME PROBLEMS LEARNING DOMAIN FORTY TO CULTURAL DIVERSITY THE TREES WAS COMPLETELY LEARNING ACTIVITY. IMPACT RACIAL PROFILING MAY HAVE HAD ON THEM AS INDIVIDUALS OR THEIR COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT'S OBLIGATION TO VARIOUS CULTURES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST DO TO. CREATE TRUST WITH THE- IN REGARD TO THE FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM COMPETENCY NUMBER SIX IN FIELD TRAINING PROGRAMS TOTAL COMMUNITY RELATIONS. TRAINEES RECEIVE TAILORED LOCAL DEPARTMENT INSTRUCTION ON COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND SERVICE PROFESSIONAL DEMEANOR IN COMMUNICATIONS CULTURAL DIVERSITY RACIAL PROFILING. CRIME PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING. FOR EXAMPLE. IN COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING. ONE SUBSECTION IS WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THREE OFFICER MUST DESCRIBE THE VANTAGE'S OF WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS RELATED TO COMMUNITY SAFETY QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES. ANOTHER SUBSECTION PROBLEM SOLVING. YOU ALSO MUST EXPLAIN PURPOSE PROBLEM SOLVING MODEL INCLUDING HOW TO DEVELOP PLANS WITH CITIZENS TO ADDRESS CRIME AND DISORDER PROBLEMS. AND WORK WITH CITIZENS TO IT TO ASSESS THE RESULTS OF THEIR EFFORTS. SO HOW DOES THAT WORK. I TOLD POLICE ACADEMY REQUIRES CADETS TO ENGAGE IN A MULTI DAY CULTURAL DIVERSITY PROJECT WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS CULMINATED BY REPORT BACK TO THE ACADEMY CLASS. IT DOESN'T THE STANISLAUS COUNTY SHERIFF'S ACADEMY PARTICIPATE WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN MOCK MUNICIPAL ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETINGS. IN TERMS OF FIELD TRAINING CALIFORNIA STATE PARK TRAINEE OFFICERS PARTICIPATE NATIONAL NIGHT OUT. WHEN POLICE DEPARTMENT REQUIRES IT'S TRADED ON OFFICERS TO ATTEND CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS. TORRANCE POLICE DEPARTMENT REQUIRES EACH TRAINEE OFFICERS. DO A RIDE ALONG WITH SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS INTO A TENT NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH MEETINGS. PENAL CODE SECTION EIGHT THIRTY TWO POINT FOUR B. REQUIRES THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS UNDER THE PURVIEW OF POST SUCH AS POLICE OFFICERS AND DEPUTY SHERIFFS OBTAINED THE POST BASIC CERTIFICATE. UPON COMPLETION OF PROBATION BUT NO LATER THAN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AFTER A POINT. NOW I WILL SHIFT TO THE TRAINING FOR EXISTING PEACE OFFICE POST REGULATION REQUIRES PEACE OFFICERS OBTAINED TWENTY FOUR HOURS CLOSER IF I'D CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL. TRAINING OR CPD DURING EVERY TWO YEAR CYCLE. FOURTEEN OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS MUST BE IN FOUR AREAS WRESTING CONTROL FARMS DRIVING IN STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS- THE CPT REQUIREMENTS ARE ONLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS. PEACE OFFICERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHERS AVERAGED FORTY FOUR POINT THREE HOURS PER YEAR. CERTIFIED TRAINING DURING THE LAST TWO YEAR TRAINING CYCLE WHICH ENDED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. CURRENTLY TRANSSEXUAL THIS. WE DO ANTICIPATE A REDUCTIONIN TRAINING OUR TO. IN SERVICE OFFICERS HAVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS MANDATED BY BOTH HOST AND LEGISLATURE. FOR INSTANCE OPPOSE COMMISSION REQUIRES ONLY SURGEONS TO COMPLETE IT AB OUR POST PROVIDES RECOURSE WHEN YOUR APPOINTMENT. SIMILARLY NEW TENANTS AND COMMANDERS MUST COMPLETE THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY OUR POST MANAGEMENT COURSE. WITHIN ONE YEAR APPOINTMENT FIELD TRAINING OFFICERS WERE F.

SIMILAR SIMILARLY LOCAL REQUIRES PEACE OFFICERS TO PARTICIPATE IN YEARLY PURSUIT DRIVING TRAINING AS WELL AS RACIAL PROFILING EVERY FIVE YEARS THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF MANDATED TRAINING ABOVE AND BEYOND THE STANDARD C. B. T. REQUIREMENTS. ALL IN ALL POST CURRENTLY HAS FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POST CERTIFIED TRAINING COURSES IN THE COURSE CATALOG. PROXIMALLY ONE HUNDRED OF THESE COURSES. ARE POSTED DEVELOP TRAINING COURSES WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE TRAINING COURSES DEVELOPED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PRIVATE PRISONERS. ALL FOUR THOUSAND. OF THESE COURSES MUST ADHERE TO POST CERTIFICATION STANDARDS. AND MUST GO THROUGH AT LEAST TWO LEVELS OF REVIEW BY CO STAFF. ADDITIONALLY A NEW REGULATION RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION REQUIRES EACH POST CERTIFIED TRAINING COURSE TO BE PLACED INTO MODIFICATION EVERY TWO YEARS. ROSS SAYS WHICH ESSENTIALLY PUTS THE COURSE INTO A ENDING INACTIVE STATUS TRAINING COURSE PUT PLACED IN THE MODIFICATION REQUIRES THE PRESENTER TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH REVIEW AND TO RESUBMIT THE TRAINING COURSE FOR RE CERTIFICATION THIS IS DONE TO ENSURE THE TRAINING CURRENT. AND CONTEMPORARY ONCE AGAIN CHUPA STAFF MEMBERS MUST REVIEW AND RE APPROVE THE TRAINING COURSE. DURING THE COURSE CERTIFICATION PROCESS WE REVIEWED THE TRAINING OUTLINED. TO MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH MARK AND HIS CONTEMPORARY. WE CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE PROPER STUDENT TO INSTRUCTOR RATIO WE MAKE SURE SAFETY PLAN IS IN PLACE FOR CERTAIN TRAINING AND WE REVIEW AND SCRUTINIZE THE QUALIFICATIONS OF EACH INSTRUCTOR. ON THE BACKEND THE REVIEW SURVEYS AND QUESTIONNAIRES PREPARED BY STUDENTS WE EMPLOY A ROBUST QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM WERE QUEUING BE. MISSED OPERAS ARTICULATE YES- COMMITTEE CAN SUPPOSE YOU CAN WRAP UP WE LIVED OVER- CAN YOU DO IT AND LOCAL AGENT KNOWS OKAY WE YOUR INFORMATION IS AB ONE MEDICALLY. NEEDED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WE DECERTIFIED AND REMOVE ONE PRESENTER FROM DOING FURTHER CLOSER TO FIND TRAINING. THE MAJORITY OF IN SERVICE TRAINING IS CLASSROOM BASED HOWEVER EXISTING REGULATION PERMITS IN SERVICE TRAINING TO BE CONDUCTED ONLINE. WITH PRIOR APPROVAL FRM POST MANY PRISONERS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF CONDUCTING ONLINE TRAINING DURING OPEN. ADDITIONALLY IT HAS ITS OWN LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR WHAT WE CALL THE LEARNING PORTAL. WHICH HOUSES VARIOUS POST DEVELOP SELF PACED IN VIDEO BASED TRAINING COURSES. TWENTY TWENTY ALONE WE RELEASED ON LEARNING PORTAL NEW POST DEVELOP TRAINING COURSES ON DE ESCALATION. EIGHT CRIMES GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS BIAS AND RACIAL PROFILING WELLNESS HUMAN TRAFFICKING. MENTAL HEALTH WERE NOT RESPONDING TO INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS AN INITIAL RESPONSE TO NATURAL DISASTERS.

I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE THE POSITIVE THINGS WE ARE DOING IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS AND EVERY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR RAZOR PRECIADO YOU'RE VERY THOROUGH- INFORMATIONAL ON POST- AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE THERE WERE I'M SURE THEY'LL BE SOME QUESTIONS I'M WITH YOU WE ASK IF YOU COULD JUST PLEASE- JUST STAY ON STAY ON WILK- CERTAINLY COULD GO DO YOU. NEXT WE HAVE A MRS LAND WOULD YOU PLEASE COME FORWARD AND- HAVE YOU SEE SEAT AT THE TABLE SO YOU CAN PRESENT TO ONE OF OUR PRESENTERS WE HAVE. EIGHT MINUTES- AND HOPE THAT YOU WITHIN EIGHT MINUTES YOU COULD JUST PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND JUST MOVE ON TO YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN AND- THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE TO JOINING US AND BEING PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT SO. WITH THAT BEING SAID- GREAT. PLEASE PROCEED GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON- THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME OF FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. SITTING IN THE GALLEY WE HAVE THE FAMILY OF AUGUSTINE MORALIS WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT ON NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH HE IS ONE OF TWO KILLINGS THAT OCCURRED WITHIN A TEN DAY PERIOD OF TIME- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY GOOD FRIEND CHIEF DANIEL HAHN- SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION. THAT I'VE HEARD AND I'VE BEEN TAKING NOTES- AND THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING BEING NOT ONLY A MINORITY BUT ALSO A WOMAN- SO. ONE OF THE THINGS A HERE IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRAINING- ANDTHERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT OFTENTIMES IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE TALK ABOUT AROUND TRAINING- DE ESCALATION IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS- FROM THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE WE OFTENTIMES DO NOT THINK THAT TRAINING IS NECESSARILY AN ISSUE NOW TO SPEAK FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY BUT I SPEAK JUST FOR A SELECT FEW MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND WHY I SAY THAT IS BECASE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT VERY SPECIFICALLY DE ESCALATION TACTICS. OR TRAINING WE NOTICED THAT WHEN IT COMES TO KILLINGS OR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT IT IS ALWAYS THE CONVERSATION COMES ABOUT TRAINING HOWEVER WHEN IS A NON WHITE SHOOTER THAT HAS GONE INTO A SCHOOL OR INTO A CHURCH AND WE KNOW THAT HE HAS KILLED NUMEROUS PEOPLE WE OFTENTIMES CAN'T SEE HIM BEING PEACEFULLY ARRESTED HE HAS NOT BEEN TASTY HAS NOT BEEN BETTER BEERS HE MAY EVEN BE TAKEN FOR ONE OF HIS FAVORITE MEALS AND SO THEREFORE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT TRAINING AROUND THE ESCALATION IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE CLEARLY. LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS HOW TO DE ESCALATE WHEN THEY DEEM IT TO BE APPROPRIATE- ALSO THERE IS THE ISSUE OF CENTER MASS SHOOTING. OF THE CENTER- WE ARE OFTENTIMES SEEING THESE TYPES OF KILLINGS WHERE. WHETHER ARMED OR UNARMED PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE BEING SHOT AT CENTER MASS. AND THEIR BODIES ARE BEING RIDDLED WITH NUMEROUS BULLETS OFTENTIMES LEADING INTO THEIR DEATH- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE DIFFERENT TRAINING AROUND THAT- WHY IS IT THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE VIRAL VIDEOS WHERE WE HAVE A WHITE ASSAILANTS- OR SUSPECT WHO IS ABLE TO. WRESTLE WITH OFFICERS TAKE THEIR WEAPONS TO BE ABLE TO JUMP INTO THEIR VEHICLES AND TAKE ALL OF THEM YET. WE GET BACK TO THE ISSUE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND OR LATINOS BEING KILLED- THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS POSED TO ME HOW THIS TRAINING ENSURE AN OFFICER IS INTEGRATED INTO THE COMMUNITY- I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF AND I'M GOING TO DEVIATE HERE FOR A MOMENT A LOT OF MY EXPERIENCE HAS COME FROM MY- RELATIONSHIP WITH CHIEF DANIEL HAHN. AND I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ASKED COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WE BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THOSE TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT TO THE ACADEMY THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE USE OF FORCE SIMULATOR BECAUSE WHEN WE HEAR THE PUSH BACK FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WE GO% THROUGH YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. IN SPLIT SECONDS WELL IN ORDER FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION NOT JUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT ALSO WITH MY COMMUNITY TO GET THEM TO HAVE A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING ON BOTH AISLES OF THE SPECTRUM- I WENT OUT TO THE ACADEMY. I'VE BEEN OUT OF THE ACADEMY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WE'VE BEEN OUT OF THE ACADEMY WITH YOU- AND CONSULTING WITH YOU. HOW THEY PERCEIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN DIFFERENTLY- I WALKING A UNIQUE SPACE BETWEEN. THE CHIEF OF POLICE- FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY EXCESSIVE AND OR DEADLY USE OF FORCE. AND THEN THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER DEMOGRAPHIC- THAT WE OFTENTIMES DON'T TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INTERACTIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THAT THOSE ARE THE FAMILIES OF CRIME VICTIMS- WE OFTENTIMES HEAR THERE IS WHAT I NOW CALL AFFECTIONATELY CALL HASHTAG ACTIVISM. AND THAT IS NOT TO DEMEAN ANY OF WHAT IS BEING SAID. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KIND OF. EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT AND THAT IS THIS CONCEPT THAT HAS COME OUT OF. THE KILLING OF GEORGE FOLLOWED WHERE WE HEAR DEFINED THE POLICE. OKAY OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SPEAK OF THIS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT RE ALLOCATING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT'S BUDGET. IN ORDER TO RE ENFRANCHISE THE COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY LOOK LIKE BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SPECTRUMS HERE WE HAVE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF CRIME WHO ACTUALLY LOOKED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM SOLVE THE CRIME OR GET JUSTICE FOR THAT WHICH HAS BEEN PERPETRATED AGAINST THEM. IF WE DEFINE LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE WE ARE REMOVING THE NECESSITY OF THE RESOURCES THAT THESE FAMILIES NEED IN ORDER TO GET THE JUSTICE THAT THEY'RE SEEKING- BUT- UP ON THE ISSUE OF THE FUNDING. I BELIEVE THAT IT'S MORE THAN JUST A FUNDING LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THE REALITY OF IT IS. DEFINING LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THE KILLINGS STOP. LEGISLATION IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THE KILLINGS STOP YOU CANNOT LEGISLATE AWAY SYSTEMIC RACISM. NOR CAN YOU LEGISLATE AWAY HATRED- I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HEARING ABOUT MR APPEALS. PERCEPTION OF WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD LOOK LIKE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE REALISTIC AND THAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA- POLICE CAME OUT OF. SLAVE PATROLS WHICH IF WE LOOK AT THE VIOLENCE THAT HAS BEEN PERPETRATED AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY- IT HAS BEEN ROUTED IN VIOLENCE. UP YOU CAN GOOGLE LYNCHINGS RIGHT NOW AND YOU WILL SEE BLACK MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN HANGING FROM TREES BEING BURNED TO THEIR BODIES BEING MUTILATED OFTENTIMES. YOU KNOW SKIN EARS. FINGERS BEING TAKEN AS SOUVENIRS SURROUNDED BY A GROUP OF OFTENTIMES WHITE MEN WOMEN CHILDREN SOMETIMES WITH BABIES IN THEIR ARMS AND SO WE HAVE TO BE COGNITIVE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY AN ISSUE OF TRAINING. THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY AN ISSUE OF HOW DO WE REFORM A SYSTEM THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND OR SERVE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO LOOK LIKE ME- THIS IS AN ISSUE OF DEEP SYSTEMIC RACISM- AS FAR AS SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY BEEN ABLE TO HAVE AND AGAIN THAT HAS BEEN- THROUGH DANIEL HìNH. THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND THE ACADEMY- I HAVE GONE THROUGH TRANSFORMATIONAL POLICING MODEL COURSE- WE HAVE SPOKEN AT THE BLACK CAUCUS ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE USE OF FORCE SIMULATOR- WE HAVE GONE ON A WEEKLY WALKS UNTIL THE PANDEMIC IT WHERE HE TAKES- CADETS FROM THE ACADEMY. AND HE TAKES THEM ON A COMMUNITY WALK EVERY FRIDAY THROUGH ALL PARK WHERE WE HAVE DOGS BARKING WE HAVE PEOPLE SITTING ON THEIR PORCHES CONSUMING MARIJUANA WE HAVE LOUD MUSIC AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE OFFICERS IN TRAINING ARE WHITE AND THEY ARE IN A PREDOMINATELY BLACK ENVIRONMENT- I COMMEND HIM. FOR DOING THAT BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WHAT IS THE ISSUE WE DO NOT HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO LOOK LIKE US. AROUND THE ISSUE OF AND SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY BEEN. PRESSING ON ME AS I SIT AND I LISTEN AROUND THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENTS- WE HEAR ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE BUT YET HAVE I HEARD HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. RAISE THE EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS AND GIVE TO THE COMMUNITIES INSTEAD OF LOWERING OR CHANGING THE REQUIREMENTS HOW DO WE RE ENFRANCHISE THE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM MORE THAN A SUB PAR OR SUB STANDARD EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM SO THAT THEY CAN THEN BEGAN TO QUALIFY FOR THESE TYPES OF. JOBS THAT IS WHAT IS MOST INTERESTING TO ME AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING IT'S NOT JUST THE FUNDING LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S ABOUT THE FUNDING OF A RIGHTY OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO RE ENFRANCHISE THE COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WE DO NOT CONTINUE TO HAVE CHILDREN OR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE EXPERIENCING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THAT CONTINUE TO LEAD THEM TO ACCEPTING OR CHOOSING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR AS COPING MECHANISMS. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO BE CRIMINALIZED ND VALUE WISE IN THIS COUNTRY AS LONG AS WE HAVE STOOD FOOT ON IT AND SO THOUGH I RESPECT THE CONVERSATION AROUND THE NECESSITY FOR REFORM AGAIN I POSE THE QUESTION HOW DO YOU REFORM A SYSTEM THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND OR SERVE. ANYONE WHO LOOKS LIKE ME OR LIKE YOU. IN REGARDS TO EXCESSIVE OR DEADLY USE OF FORCE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT IS AGAIN AN EXTENSION OF THE OF AMERICAN FOUNDATIONAL PRACTICES. HEY WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY SYSTEMATICALLY INTENTIONALLY BEEN TREATED AS SUB STANDARD WE SEE THAT AND LEGISLATION DOES NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY HELP IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME OR THREE FIFTHS OF A HUMAN BEING WE MUST LOOK AT THE FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS OF THIS COUNTRY. AND SEE HOW IT CONTINUES TO PERPETUATE THE OVERALL MENTALITY OF PEOPLE HERE THE STATISTICS ARE STARK TO HEAR THAT OVER 50% OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE MALES. AGAIN THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHO RECOGNIZE US AS BEING HUMAN BEINGS. THE MAYOR COMPLEXION OF MY SKIN MAKES ME A CRIMINAL IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS PROBLEMATIC. WHEN WE COMPARED THE UNITED STATES TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN REGARDS TO POLICING I THINK AGAIN THAT WE WOULD BE A MESS IF WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED PSYCHOLOGICALLY INDOCTRINATED THIS THING CALLED RACE. WHICH LEADS TO RACISM. WHICH ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO OTHER ONE ANOTHER. WE SAY THAT POLICING IS SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUSIVE THAT IT IS THE COMMUNITY HOWEVER THERE IS THAT US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY SO THEREFORE LAW ENFORCEMENT NOR THE COMMUNITIES. ARE ABLE TO BRIDGE THE GAP IT IS THROUGH THE TYPE OF WORK IT IS THROUGH THE TYPE OF PROGRAMMING THAT CHIEF DANIEL HAHN IS IMPLEMENTING- THAT WE ARE ABLE TO BEGIN TO OPEN UP AND HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND LOOK AT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR US TO COME TOGETHER TO BUILD SOMETHING NEW DIFFERENT SUSTAINABLE- ARM. WHEN WE LOOK AT A PROFESSIONALISM OR WE TALK ABOUT THE CORE OF POLICING AND THAT THAT THE CORE POLICING IS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AGAIN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNITIES THAT LOOK LIKE ME. THAT'S PROBLEMATIC- WE RECENTLY HAD A KILLING OF TWO YOUNG MEN AT ARDEN FAIR MALL AND OUR MAYOR CAME OUT AND MADE A COMMENT ALLUDING THAT THIS MAY BE GANG RELATED VIOLENCE. I PERSONALLY KNOW THESE TWO YOUNG MEN. THEY WERE FRIENDS OF MY DAUGHTERS THIS WAS NOT GANG RELATED HOWEVER OUT OF THAT CONVERSATION CAME. WE NEED THERE'S A NECESSITY FOR ADDITIONAL GANG TASK FORCE OFFICERS ARE THESE OFFICERS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE ISSUES THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ONE JOINING A GANG. ARE WE REALLY LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE YOU COME FROM ECONOMICALLY DEPRIVED AND DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE FOSTER YOU A LOT OF THEM ARE BEING RAISED BY A NON PARENT THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE EITHER CAUGHT UP IN MASS INCARCERATION OR MAY YOU KNOW SUFFER FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. IT'S EASY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO CRIMINALIZE OUR CONDITION BUT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT CREATE THE ISSUES THAT WE AND WE THEN IN TURN HAVE TO ENCOUNTER LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE BEEN CRIMINALIZED FROM THE TIME WE SET. FOOT ON THE SOIL SO HOW DO WE ACTUALLY START TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ISSUES. THAT LEAD TO POLICE VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE US. SO YOU KNOW FOR ME IT IS MUCH IT'S MUCH DEEPER- THEN HOW DO WE DEAL WITH ISSUES OF REFORM- THERE HAVE BEEN- BEEN SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES. FOR US TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY YET WE FAIL TO DO THAT- I'M LOOKING AT THE WAY THAT. WE CONTINUE TO MILITARIZE THE POLICE MISS LANE I'M SORRY CAN YOU- WE HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE FOR YOU CAN JUST WRAP IT ONE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO PROBLEM SO TO CLOSE OUT WEEK WE CONTINUE TO MILITARIZE POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY. HOWEVER IF OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL ENGAGED IN THE SAME TYPE OF BEHAVIOR THAT OUR POLICE OFFICERS DO THEY WOULD BE SITTING UNDERNEATH FEDERAL PENITENTIARIES SO I AM WONDERING WHY IS IT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW CERTAIN PRACTICES TO OCCUR IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY YET THERE IS NO LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH MISS LAND WE APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU HAVE SHARED WITH US THUS FAR- MY COLLEAGUE- IS RUBIO WANTS TO MAKE ONE COMMENT BEFORE WE GO TO OUR NEXT- SPEAKER. MAYES RUBIO YES I THANK YOU HI YOU'RE SPEAKING MY LANGUAGE I AM SO EXCITED TO HEAR YOU SAYING WHAT YOU JUST SAID BECAUSE I FELT LIKE A BROKEN RECORD AND I FELT- THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE LOOKING AT ME. WEIRD BECAUSE I KEPT SAYING THE HASH TAG- YOU KNOW THE FROM THE POLICE IT WAS A JUST A HASH TAG BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU MY NUMBER I AM IN SACRAMENTO FOR A FEW DAYS AND I WANT TO MEET WITH YOU AFTERWARDS BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE I'LL HAVE HOW- DIFFERENT FOLKS ARE TRICK OR TREATED. I LAST YEAR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU RECALL THAT IN THE SENATE THERE WERE SOME BLOOD THROWN ON THE SENATORS. RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT WHITE WOMAN WHEN SHE WAS pCOMING OUT THEY THEY THEY GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND THERE IF IT WAS OUT. OF MY PENAL OR OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PERSON THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR HANDS AND THEIR BACK AND I MADE THAT COMMENT I REMEMBER I MADE THAT COMMENT TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. THAT IT'S HAPPENING EVEN HERE WITHIN OUR YOU KNOW THE THIS AMAZING BUILDING THAT WOMAN WAS TREATED VERY DIFFERENTLY AS IF IT WAS UP UP AND NOT BEING OR AN AFRICAN AMERICANS WILL THINK YOU AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO. SIT WITH YOU AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE- WE CAN SAY ALL OF THESE AMAZING THINGS OF NOTE NOTICE. MISTER GIBSON BUT IF NOTHING COMES OUT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'M JUST WASTING MY TIME HERE AND SO I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND REALLY HAVE. HAVE YOU KNOW THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I KNOW MISTER GIBSON PERSONALLY AND HE WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR US TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS. BUT IT HAS TO BE MULTI FACETED COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS AND THE POLICE- YOU KNOW THAT THE POLICE COMMUNITY ALREADY THAT PEACE OFFICER COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT BY OURSELVES BUT WE NEED. THAT HONEST CONVERSATION THAT YOU JUST HAD AND A LOT OF US. ARE FREE TO HAVE SO THANK YOU. IN THANK YOU VERY. MR OF YOUR- AND THAT'S THE REASON WE HAVE THIS ROBE. COVER TO. SO THAT WE CAN. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES DIFFERENT INPUT DIFFERENT IDEALS SOME DIFFERENT BACKS BACKGROUND THE WALKS OF LIFE- TO HAVE BEEN BLEND THEIR VOICES IN WITH THIS CONVERSATION SO I THINK WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE- SOMETHING VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT AS I KNOW. NOT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE HERE BUT WE HAVE- COLLEAGUES WHOSE. STAFFS ARE WATCHING AND TAKING NOTES- WE'RE LOOKING FOR REAL- WE'RE LOOKING TO RE IMAGINE LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT CALIFORNIA AND THIS. HELPS GETS A SLAP POLITICAL POINT TIME. SO AT THIS TIME AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS LAST FOR YOUR COMMENTS WE REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR VOICE IN THIS IN THIS SPACE- NEXT ONE GO TO OUR NEXT- PRESENTER. MISTER HAD NEW- WOULD YOU PLEASE- OPERATE WOULD YOU PLEASE. ALLOW ME TO HANDLE TO PLEASE COMMAND- AND PLEASE I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR LAST NAME TO COMPLETE IS A NANCY IT'S OUR LAST NAME FOR SO WE CAN HAVE IT ON RECORD. AND WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE JOINING US. SO MODERATE THE COULD PLEASE LET ME TO HANDLE IN. TO- JOIN US. HELLO MY AFTERNOON YOUR LINE IS OPEN GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ON POLICE REFORM- MY NAME IS TYLER TIE MY I'M A DIRECTOR SOME OF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ME AS DEGENHARDT- I AM A DIRECTOR. OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS RANK AND FILE OFFICERS- AND OUT AS I WRITE OFF INTO THE SUNSET OF RETIREMENT. IN THE NEXT MONTH I'M THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE LESSONS THAT I HAVE LEARNED. AS A POLICE OFFICER. THE UNION LEADER AND AN ADVOCATE FOR PROFESSIONAL LIGHTING. THE PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- BIELIK HAD ABBOTT OF PROFESSIONAL CITING POLICE. IT IT IT'S- WITH CHINA BILL TWO TWO TWO YEAR AGO- WE BELIEVE THAT OUR POLICING SHOULD BE. MOLD MORE- STANDARDIZED AND OUR STANDARDS SHOULD BE RAISED- WE HAVE ADVOCATED PUSHING OUT RATE TO STOP THIS FROM POLICING WE HAVE ADVOCATED EARLY WARNING MONITORING PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS LIKE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED HERE IN. LOS ANGELES I HAVE ALWAYS ASK FOR MORE TRAINING NOT LESS- WE HAVE USED IMPORTANT WORDS TODAY LIKE PROTECT AND TO SERVE AND MUTUAL RESPECT WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING ABOVE WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES AND EXPERTS BOTH FROM THE ACADEMIA LAW ENFORCEMENT- THE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BEING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTRUSTED WITH THE SACRED DUTY OF. A PROVIDING EQUITABLE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF RACE. CREED COLOR BACKGROUND OR THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY LIVE IN. AND I APPRECIATE DOLLAR TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION- WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINING THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING AND TOUCHES MANY DIFFERENT THINGS I APPRECIATE- THE PRIOR TO SPEAKERS WHO HIGHLIGHTED MANY IMPORTANT THINGS- IT TRAINING IMPROVES. THE OUR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY TO THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SERVING. FIVE IT CAN ALSO HAS A VERY BIG IMPACT ON AND IF WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS- THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE POLICE CULTURE IT STARTS AND WITH THE WITH RETRAINING POLICE OFFICERS. AND THE BIGGEST THING BEING OBVIOUSLY- WHICH TRAINING IS TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY AND PLEASE CONTACT AND OUTCOMES- I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SHARE INSIGHT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF RANK AND FILE POLICE OFFICER ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING AND ONGOING TRAINING. I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE TOPLINE POINT- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DO NOT RECEIVE MUCH ONGOING TRAINING PERIOD. NOT ALL TRAINING IS CREATED EQUALLY- JUST BECAUSE AN OFFICER IS QUOTED TRAINED ON AN ISSUE DOES NOT MEAN THE TRAINING IS QUALITY MEANINGFUL. SOME OF THE CLOSE TRAINING- AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE- AND SO DO MANY OF MANY OTHER OFFICES THAT I'VE SPOKEN WITH AND I'M NOT TO CRITICIZE POST BUT I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER IF WE START TO DO THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND I THINK WE SHOULD DO THE SAME THING WITH THE POST- WOOD BUT I DO APPRECIATE THEIR TRAINING- IT'S ALSO NOT ALWAYS TRAINED TO DO WHAT LAWMAKERS OR THE PUBLIC EXPECT THEM TO DO- MANY TIMES. AND IT'S JUST THE FORM THAT IT- IT IS DONE AND- LOG OUT FIRST PASSED AND THEN WE BECOME- A LOT OF TIMES. THE IMPLEMENTATION AND BECOMING. OR. PROVIDING TRAINING. FIVE SO SOMETIMES THERE'S A ONE OR TWO YEAR GAP IN OPTIONS NOT PROPER. TRAINED IN WHAT THE LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED BUT WE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE LAWS IN THAT TIME- ONE OF THE STARKEST EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THAT PROPOSED HAS COMPLETED THE MODEL DE ESCALATION TRAINING- IN THE AST FEW MONTHS. EVEN THOUGH POLICE OFFICERS ARE BEING HELD TO THE STANDARD ESTABLISHED IN THE ASSEMBLY BILL THREE NINETY TWO FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. OFFICERS HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW STANDARD. I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH ONE OF OUR TRAINERS IN THE LOS ANGELES POLICE ACADEMY THE CHANGE THAT CHANGED OUR- RECRUITING TACTICS. AND SHE WAS- ARE STILL CONFUSED AFTER SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AND SOME OF THE- DIRECTION THAT SHE HAD GOTTEN. AND FROM A COMPUTER TRAINER TO THE NEW RECRUITS YOU CAN SEE THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE NOT PREPARING OUR OFFICERS SUFFICIENTLY. BOB FOR THE STREET. EVEN THOUGH IT MAY THINK. MORE FIREARMS TRAINING WILL HELP OFFICERS- AND- IT'S EASY TO. I'VE HEARD THESE THINGS THAT OFFICES ARE GETTING TOO MUCH FIREARMS TRAINING AND THAT WE'RE CREATING KILLERS AND THAT TYPE OF STUFF AND THAT SIMPLY IS NOT TRUE- MORE SELF DEFENSE TRAINING- ALL. FIREARMS TRAINING- WILL ONLY RESULT IN MORE SELF CONFIDENT OFFICERS WHO HAVE COMPETITION THEIR SKILLS. AND BIG WILL DEREK BENNER TO DEPLOYED ITS TACTICS AND THE PROPER POLICY APPROVED TACTICS. BECAUSE IN HER COMPETENCE AND- AND- ABILITY TO CONTROL THE SITUATION IN HIGH STRESS SITUATIONS WE FALL BACK ON TRAINING AND MUSCLE MEMORY IN ORDER TO DEVELOP MUSCLE MEMORY THOUGHT PATTERNS AND PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS HAVE TO BE TRAINED THOUSANDS OF TIMES OVER SO THAT IT BECOMES NOT OF AUTOMATION. WHEN CALLED UPON. THE COMPETENT AND CONFIDENT- AND STATE POLICE OFFICER THERE FOR STATE POLICE OFFICER THEY ARE LIKELY TO USE LESS FORCE THAN THOSE WHO HAVE NO COMPETENCE OR LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR TRAINING. RIGOROUS TRAINING MUST BE ONGOING. IT IS IT IS GOING TO YIELD THE RESULT THAT LAWMAKERS HOPING FOR. THIS MEANS RECOGNIZING THE RECOGNIZING THAT WHEN DEPARTMENTS ARE DECLINED IT THE FIRST THING THAT CAUGHT OUR EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY THE SECOND THING IS CUT OUR CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES. THE THIRD TIER OF CUTS ARE TRAINING. WELLNESS PROGRAMS OFFICERS AND SPECIALIZED UNITS. THE FUNDING% DEPARTMENT PRODUCES LOWER QUALITY DEPARTMENTS WERE STRETCHED THIN AND ARE NOT-ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY BECOME REAL PROBLEMS. IT'S ACTUALLY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I'M GOING TRAINING FOR PEACE OFFICERS IS VITAL BECAUSE MANY OF THE SKILLS THAT I LEARNED IN THE ACADEMY ARE PERISHABLE SKILLS. AND NEED TO BE CONTINUOUSLY REFRESHED IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THE OFFICER THE SUSPECT AND THE BYSTANDERS. POST REQUIRED ONGOING TRAINING TWENTY FOUR HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS BUT THIS TRAIN DOES NOT PREPARE OFFICERS FOR THE EXPECTATION TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. BOB PERSONAL SKILLS TRAINING CONSISTS OF A MINIMUM OF FOURTEEN HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS. THE FOCUS OF THIS TRAINING HAS TO BE ON THE ARREST OF CONTROL- IT'S USUALLY HAND CUPPING SUSPECT DRIVING. IT COULD BE SLOW SPEED DRIVING AND PARKING THE VEHICLE AND QUALIFYING WITH A FIREARM. BOB ALTERCATION IS- WHATEVER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AS MINIMUM STANDARDS AND OFTEN TIMES- DEPARTMENTS ARE STRETCHED JAN AND BARE. BOB DONNAN UNABLE TO PROVIDE FURTHER. MEANINGFUL YEAH INSTRUCTION IN FIREARMS TRAINING IN REALITY WE DO WE SPEND ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AT THE RANGE QUALIFYING FIVE TIMES A YEAR WITHOUT SIDE SIDE ARM AND WITH A SHOT GUN ONCE A YEAR- AND THAT IS THE EXTENT OF OUR TRAINING SO THAT AMOUNTS ABOUT. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES OF REQUIRED- LOG OF FIREARMS SHOOTING AND TRAINING. SO THE THOSE ARE THE REAL QUALITIES- OF THE REALITIES OF LOG A LOT OF TRAINING. SO I WOULD NOT CONSIDER THESE REQUIREMENTS TO BE A RIGOROUS AT ALL- AND THEN I JUST TOUCHED UPON THE PUBLIC FIREARMS QUALIFICATION IS FOR A LOT OF DEPARTMENTS SOME DO QUARTERLY COME TO EVERY OTHER MONTH- BUT- OFTENTIMES UNLESS YOU WORK IN A SPECIALIZED UNIT YOU'RE NOT RECEIVING THE TRAINING THAT YOU NEED. A SPECIALIZED UNITS ARE NOT- FOR THE MOST PART- FIRST RESPONDING PATROL UNITS BOB THAT YOU YOU RECEIVE WHEN YOU CALL NINE ONE ONE- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TACTICAL. AND INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES BUT WE RECEIVED TWO HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS. THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TRAINING TO PRODUCE OFFICERS SKILLED AT DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES. ALTHOUGH MANY DEPARTMENTS THEY ATTEMPT TO DO THE BEST JOB THAT THEY CAN PROVIDING NEEDS- THAT THE TRAINING AND IT VARIES- IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH- SO WHEN I LISTEN TO. SOME TALK ABOUT DE ESCALATION IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WHAT HAS BEEN ASKED IS PHONE OFFICER WHO WAS ADVANCED- QUITE ADVANCED TRAINING IN CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY CLINICAL CRIMINOLOGY. AND ADVANCING GLACIATIONS SKILLS AND- THAT IS JUST SIMPLY NOT- TRUE AND THAT IS NOT THE REALITY AND- WE DID FOCUS GROUPS ON A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO STATEWIDE FOCUS GROUPS AND WE ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEIR PERCEPTION OF WHAT THEY BELIEVED. AN OFFICERS TRAINING% TO BE. AND THE PERCEPTION THAT THE PUBLIC GENERAL PUBLIC HELD IN CALIFORNIA BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THEIR TRAINING- WHAT ABOUT NIGHT AND DAY BETWEEN WHAT THEY THINK AND WHAT ACTUALLY IS- THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WE STATE WE NEED TO START THE DAY AT THE RANGE. BAYAT BECOMING EXPERT- SHOOTERS WE ARE NOT EXPERT SHOOTERS WE ARE NOT- THE MOST ABOUT THAT EXPERT SHOOTERS- WE ARE NOT A TRAINED MARTIAL ARTISTS- WE GET SOME TRAINING AND ALL THAT. GOES UP HARASSED- I AM LOVE WE GET COURTNEY COURSES IS NOT THAT MUCH FROM WHAT IS BEING ACTUAL POLICE OFFICERS AND I AM MOST FORTY HOURS OF TRAINING- SO. THAT IS NOT THE LEVEL OF TRAINING THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDES TO OFFICERS AND WHAT I'M ALSO TALKING ABOUT IS IT SUPPOSED BEING FUNDED PROPERLY- IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO RESOURCES AND BUDGETARY ISSUES AND FUNDING AND I REALIZE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS A VERY DIFFICULT JOB. IN A MAKING MONEY LAST FOR ALL PASSAGE OF CALIFORNIANS NEEDS- BUT CAN'T IT HAS BECOME SUCH A BIG ISSUE WE WOULD ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO. MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS PROPER FUNDING FOR- ENHANCING POLICE TRAINING- SO WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE MORE INTENSE LOOK AT INVESTING IN THE QUALITY TRAINING THAT REFLECT THE TYPE OF POLICE ORGANIZATIONS. ARE YOU WANT TO SEE ESPECIALLY MEETING THIS TIME IN OUR IN OUR- IN OUR COUNTRY WHERE ABOUT POLICING HAS BECOME SUCH A HOT TOPIC AND IT SHOULD BE- I REMEMBER GOING TO THE ACADEMY NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND I REMEMBER- THAT. AND IS EXPECTING STATE AND MATURED IMPROVED BUT- WE DIDN'T HAVE EXTRA COOK REAL QUESTION A ROLE OF THE POLICE IN OUR SOCIETY COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT COURSE SUIT TO BE HAD AND IT SHOULD BE MANDATED. ANOTHER ONE SHOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL TRAINING AT THE APPLICATION. IN EVERYDAY KILL CONTACTS. CASHING IN THE CAR THE FREE SHOULD BE A PICNIC IMPACT IN OFFICE IT SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT- WE SHOULD HAVE CLEAR ARTICULABLE FACTS TO SUPPORT EVERY STOP THAT WE MAKE- WHAT WE HAVE DONE ALSO AND I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER. ABOUT HAVING GONE THROUGH THE USE OF FORCE OPTION SIMULATOR- WE HAVE ALSO DIED ON THAT WE HAVE ALSO BROUGHT IT SHOULD BE KEPT STATE CAPITOL FOR THE LEGISLATORS TO GO THROUGH DURING THE AB THREE NINETY TWO- YEAH. THE TICKET MATCHED AND- WE APPRECIATE EVERYONE GOING THROUGH AND GIVEN OUR OUR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW- HOW THINGS CAN. HAPPEN AND HOW QUICKLY THEY HAVE BEEN AND HOW VOLATILE THINGS CAN BE. AND I HAVE I HAVE ATTENDED MY SHARE OF POLICE GENERALS AND THOSE ARE REAL LIFE AFFECTED JUST THE WAY- ARE- YEAH ACTIVISTS TALK ABOUT LIFE THAT ARE LOST IN PLEASE BEEN COUNTER SO- CUTS BOTH WAYS- WE HAVE ALSO CONDUCTED COMMUNITY POLICE ACADEMIES- IN IN HIGH CRIME AREAS. THAT WE FIND TO BE VERY HELPFUL ALL THESE I THINK THAT SHOULD BE TRIED IN EVERY- EVERY COMMUNITY- THAT. THERE'S A NEED FOR AND MAYBE NOT EVERY COMMUNITY I THINK ONE THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT WE ARE NOT MONOLITHIC. WE ARE NOT- COMMUNITIES ARMAND NOT MONOLITHIC AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME ECONOMY FOR TO EACH JURISDICTION BE GIVEN AND SEE WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES IS IT NOT IN TRAINING- BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME THINGS THAT ARE. ARE STANDARDIZED AND WE CAN ALWAYS WE SHOULD ALWAYS AIM TO HAVE BILLS STANDARDIZATION IS ADS- HIGH. VALUE IN TRAINING AS POSSIBLE- WHAT I STATED- I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF- OF DISCONNECT WHEN I STATED EARLIER THAT THE PEACE OFFICERS ARE NOT TRAINED TO DO WHAT LAWMAKERS OR THE PUBLIC EXPECT THEM TO DO. I MEANT THAT THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED WHAT THEY'RE TRAINED IN DOING AND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF OFFICERS. OPERATE THE DAY BETWEEN NINETY TWO AND I REFER TO THAT. AS ABOUT EARLIER WHEN OUR OWN SOME OF OUR OWN TRAINERS. ARE CONFUSED. TWO YEARS LATER- DAHLE PROTECT PROPORTIONALITY ABOUT THE LANGUAGE ABOUT ARE. NOT GETTING ENOUGH DIRECTION- FROM MODEST STATE- YOU CAN YOU CAN EXPECT. TO HAVE- A SUB STANDARD TRAINING- REGIMENTS AND SUB STANDARD RESULTS. AND WE HAVE TO DO ALL RIGHT. FOR THE OCCASION AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN- FOR THERE HAVE BEEN- MHM I HAD ACTUALLY MAKE MY- I DON'T HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE A SECURE WAS GOING TO JUST JUMPING WE HAVE ONE MINUTE FOR YOU. OKAY WELL I'M JUST GONNA WRAP IT UP I HAD A MANY MANY NEEDS TO STATUS OF FACE ON THE FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT I- I'M TRYING TO DO MY BEST HERE- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF AREA WHERE- WE HAVE A GREAT CHANCE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. OF THE LEGISLATURE THE POLICE UNION POLICE CHIEFS- AND THE EXPERTS- AND YAKKING DAY OUT FROM THE ACADEME AND I APPRECIATE THEM BEING PRESENT HERE TODAY AS WELL- I THINK IT'S BECAUSE COULD BE SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT. THAT WE COULD BE A MODEL TO- OTHER STATES IN THE UNION. ALL DOGS WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO ALL OF THESE ROBUST DISCUSSIONS WANT TO BE PART OF IT WE WANT TO ARKANSAS- WE WANT. TO BE. PERCEIVED AS A PARTNER. AND WE WANT TO IMPROVE OUR IMAGE IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN OUR STATE AND THAT IS OUR COMMITMENT FROM ALL THE POLICE UNIONS. OFTEN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECT WE APPRECIATE. YOU AND REPRESENT LOS ANGELES PROTECTIVE LEAGUE IN YOUR COMMENTS- THEY WERE VERY MUCH WELL WELL RECEIVED AND AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WISH YOU WELL ON YOUR RETIREMENT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY OF LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY. SO WITH THAT- WE'VE CONCLUDED OUR PANEL- WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP FOR MEMBERS- TO ASK QUESTIONS AGAIN MEMBERS WHO ARE WITH US VIRTUALLY. WILL ASK YOU TAX ME SO I CAN PLACE YOU IN THE QUEUE. BUT WE DO HAVE ONE MEMBER- RB K. YOU'RE UP- YOU THE FIRST ONE IN THE- ON THE- AGAIN. ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO. ME THAT ALSO. YOU IN THE- WITH THAT BEING SAID YOUR- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M ALWAYS READY WITH MY QUESTION- SO I THINK THE PANELISTS FOR AT THAT INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT TRAINING I ALSO ANYTHING MISS LAND. REALLY HITTING HOME THE POINT OF HOW MUCH WORK WE HAVE TO DO TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AND THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT. BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. I WOULDN'T REALLY ONE THING WHICH IS THE WORK OF CHIEF TO HOT AT IN EMERYVILLE ON TRAINING RELATED TO MINDFULNESS I THINK THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS. TOO OFTEN DISMISSED SHE'S DONE INCREDIBLE WORK FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE GET POLICE OFFICERS. IN THE MOMENT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS IN WHAT IS THAT TRAINING LOOK LIKE ON AN EVERYDAY BASIS I THINK WE NEED MORE. CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AROUND TRAINING THAT WILL CHANGE THE CULTURE AND I THINK SHE'S BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THAT WORK AND HOPEFULLY SHE- I KNOW SHE RETIRED FROM THE EMERYVILLE POLICE PART BUT I KNOW SHE CONTINUES TO BE IN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LEFT UP. DIFFERENT AND NEW VOICES ABOUT WHAT OUR POLICE TRAINING SHOULD LOOK LIKE- MY QUESTION THOUGH. FOR THE PANELISTS IS TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION WE HEARD. IN THE FIRST PANEL WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE PIECES OF THE TRAINING. THAT LEAD TO DISQUALIFICATION. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN DISPROPORTIONATELY RIGHT THEY HIGHLIGHTED AND- SHOOTING. AND DRIVING IS THE TWO KEY ELEMENTS THE TWO DEPARTMENTS THEIR ONLINE BOTH SAN FRANCISCO AND SACRAMENTO TALKED ABOUT. THEIR OWN WORK TO ADDRESS THAT LOCALLY. BUT CLEARLY THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE AT THE STATE LEVEL SHOULD WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT POST IS DONE TO ADDRESS THIS. MISTER ARBORISTS FROM POST WE LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION TO STAY WITH US. SO WE DID AN ANALYSIS IN TWENTY NINETEEN SO YOUR RATES AT THE ACADEMY AND THE FAILURE RATES WERE NOT BASED ON. OUR SIX- I'M SORRY CHECK- OR RACE OR ETHNICITY THE FAILURE RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE CABIN RECRUITER CAN DEBTS WERE FAILING OUT OF THE ACADEMY AT THAT POINT IN TIME. 10% WERE SELF DISMISSALS AND 5% WERE ACTUALLY FIELD TESTS. PREDOMINANT AREAS IF THEY ARE FAILING IS A FIREARMS TRAINING AND- AMERICAN C. VEHICLE OPERATIONS TRAINING. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLE OPERATIONS TRAINING OR FORTY HOURS OF TRAINING I BELIEVE AT THAT TIME WE ARE CONDUCTING THAT STUDY- THE ACADEMIES ARE AVERAGING SEVENTY SEVEN HOURS OF DRIVER TRAINING. WE ARE VERY MUCH REINFORCED WITH THE- WITH THE DIFFERENT ACADEMIES NEED FOR REMEDIATION FOR PROPER REMEDIATION FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE LEARNED SKILLS ARE I THINK YOU WILL SEE LESS ARE LESS PEOPLE. FAILING OUT BECAUSE OF G. ROCKET FIRINGS AND WE DID TWO YEARS AGO I DON'T WANT TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THAT REPORT I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE- BUT- I HAVEN'T READ THE DRAFT REPORT UNITS FLOATING AROUND BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. IT WILL GO INTO GREAT DETAIL. ON ALL OF THE TESTING NOT JUST FARMS AND- AND DRIVING. BUT WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH THE ACADEMY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT REMEDIATION TO IMPROPERLY MEDIATION. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS IN BOTH FIREARMS AND DRIVING AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE SOME RESULTS. THANK U. S. ROSE I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT REPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WILL HAVE- MEMORY YES MISS REYES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD DESCRIBED SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS POST CERTIFICATION ACADEMY. SO THE QUESTION IS TO WHAT EXTENT ARE EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT ACADEMIES INSTILLING A SENSE OF DEDICATION TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE RECRUITS THAT ARE BEING THOSE ARE BEING RECRUITED AB WHERE IS THERE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION TO OUR RESIDENTS LIKE TAKE THAT QUESTION. SURE SO THE- EVERY EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE ACADEMY I BELIEVE THERE'S APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN OF THE FORTY ONE POLICE ACADEMIES OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHINESE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ADVISORY BOARD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THEM CAN PUT ON WITH THEIR LOCAL MEATS ARE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY- THAT ALLOWS THEM TO TAILOR THE TRAINING TO THOSE AGENCIES THAT THEY'RE SERVING OUR- EACH ACADEMIES. IS WRITTEN. PROVIDE STANDARDIZED TRAINING BUT THEY ALSO- HAVE THE ABILITY TO MODIFY THE TRAINING IN CERTAIN AREAS FOR THEIR LOCAL COMMITTEE I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- LET'S SEE AN ACADEMY AND- COLLEGES THERE- SISKIYOU IN- INVERNESS COUNTY. THEY DO NOT HAVE VERY MUCH OF AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR DRIVING MAYBE OFF ROAD TYPE OF DRIVING- THEY MAY INCLUDE- DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF DEALING WITH A WORLD. HE DOES NOT THEY DON'T DO OFF ROAD DRIVING ITS URBAN DRIVING IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF- TRAINING SO WE DO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO CHANGE HOW THEY ARE. HOW THEY DO THEIR ECONOMY AS LONG AS THEY MEET THE MINIMUM STANDARDS. I THINK SOME AREAS THAT. COULD POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THE ACADEMY AND I GUESS THIS IS MORE OF A CHALLENGE- CRITICISM GAS BUT AT TIMES WE TEND TO SHOW OF EVERYTHING INTO THE BASIC ECONOMY. AND THE BASIC ACADEMY IS THE BASIC ACADEMY WE TEND TO SHOVE THINGS INTO THE ACADEMY OFFICER IS NOT GOING TO. NECESSARILY HAVE TO DEAL WITH FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE YEARS OF THEIR CAREER AS A PEACE OFFICER AND THERE WOULD BE. I THINK BUT ARE TOO USED TO REMOVE SOME OF THAT'S EVERY ATOM. AND PROVIDED AT A LATER TIME REGARDLESS IF IT'S MANDATED ARE NOT MANDATED BUT SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE TO SHOVE IT ALL INTO THE ACADEMY. AND THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE BEST PLACE FOR IT THAT WOULD BE THE ONE- THE ONE THING THAT. I WOULD. YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY- TO YOU ALL IS A CONSIDERATION FUTURE MANDATE TRAINING- EACH OTHER AREAS AND I THINK IT WAS IT WAS DISCUSSED. IN GREAT DETAIL ABOUT FIREARMS AN EVIL ACT. THE KID YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE THESE DAYS ARE PROPER NOT LINING UP THE DMV UNDER SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY TO GET THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE. WHEN THEY SHOW UP TO- TO THE ACADEMY. NOT AT GROUND ZERO BUT PERHAPS- EIGHT ZERO BUT PERHAPS NEGATIVE THREE- THE ACADEMY IS CLOSED BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM FROM ZERO TO GRADUATION BUT IF THEY'RE ALREADY IN A DEFICIT- SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO GET THEM TO CATCH UP SO THERE ARE AREAS THAT PERHAPS WE CAN ADD ADDITIONAL TRAINING- IN THOSE AREAS THAT THERE ARE STRUGGLING ON DRIVING BEING ONE PERHAPS FIREARMS BEING THE OTHER- I'M OBVIOUSLY BY ADDING ADDITIONAL TRAINING HOURS A PATH THAT'S CLOSE- ON THE BACK AND NEEDED THE AGENCIES OR THE STATE SERVERS ARE ALL CONSIDERATIONS. IN TERMS OF POST IN GENERAL COAST IN CALIFORNIA IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK IN TERMS OF OTHER STATE OTHER STATES REQUIRE MOST TO CADDY MARIN COUNTY TRAINING OTHER STATES REQUIRE LESS. THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS. EIGHT HOURS SOME DO NOT HAVE A FEW TRAINING. AT ALL WHAT YOU'RE WHEN SHE GRADUATE FOR THE ACADEMY YOU'RE DONE. SO I'M PERHAPS ADDING ADDING SINCE AREAS MIGHT BE OF BENEFIT AND ALSO TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT SOMETHINGS ARE NECESSARILY BUILT FOR THE ACADEMY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T HAVE ANYONE IN THE QUEUE AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE- THIS IS FOR MR ALVAREZ WITH THERE'S A NUMBER OF ACADEMIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND IT'S ACADEMY HAS THEIR OWN IDENTITY IN TERMS OF TRAINING. IS THERE ANY LOOK AT TRYING TO CREATE A MORE I KNOW THERE'S A BASS LINE. THAT PLAYED A CALIFORNIA REQUIRES. THEN AFTER THAT THEN IT'S UP TO THE ACADEMY TECH AND TAYLOR WHATEVER THEY WANT BASED ON COMMUNITY AND OUR CONDITIONS IS THERE ANY THOUGHT OR CONVERSATION. AROUND I CONSISTENT. FOR INSTANCE AND I WANT TO USE MY COLLEAGUES- MR LACKEY I WENT TO REAL HONDA HE WENT TO THE HIGHWAY PATROL THE HIGHWAY PATROL REQUIRES. A MUCH LONGER TIME IN THE ACADEMY THEN- ANY THEN- REAL HONDA IS THERE ANY. TALK ABOUT CREATING SOME KIND OF UNIFORMITY IN TERMS OF TIME THAT'S CONSISTENT- THROUGHOUT THE TOWERS THE CALIFORNIA TERMS OF ACADEMIES AND TRAININGS. YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF THE WEIGHTY CAPPED ANDES OPERATE NOW IS THE FACT THAT THEY CAN CREATE SOMEWHAT OF A MODIFIED WORK- A DIVERSE ECONOMY FOR WHAT THEY NEED SO FOR INSTANCE- YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GET SENT YOU REFERENCED- CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL THEY DO A LOT OF DRIVING. ATOMI I SUSPECT THAT THAT THAT LEVEL OF DRIVING WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THEM MAY NOT BE NECESSARY FOR THE REAL HARM DOES- ACADEMY ALREADY WE ARE GOING TO COLLEGE ACADEMY OR PERHAPS L. A. P. YOU CAN RECEIVE DATA SHARES THEY MAY NOT REQUIRE THAT LEVEL OF TRAINING SO I THINK SETTING THE MINIMUM STANDARDS IS THE WAITING I DON'T KNOW WHAT A MINIMUM STANDARDS SHOULD BE RAISED IS A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION BUT BEING ABLE TO TAILOR THE CURRICULUM I THINK IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT- HE SAID YEAH COLLEGE OF THE REDWOODS THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT- CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND- ADDRESSING- THE NATIVE AMERICAN. COMMUNITY AND WORKING WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY- THEY- THE RESULT RISK PART OF THAT COMMUNITY EIGHT IN- IN ORDER TO. THAT MAIN BE. THE BEST TRAINING FOR LAPD IT MAY NOT BE I MEAN IT MAY NOT BE BAD TREATING BUT- THEY MAY WANT TO TAILOR IT TO SOME OTHER. OTHERCOMMUNITY THAT IS- MORE PREDOMINATE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- STERN- SO ACADEMIES DO LANGUAGE TRADING I BELIEVE SOMETHING SPANISH LANGUAGE TRAINING. WELL IN YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT- FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT WANTS TO DO- LANGUAGE TRAINING IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE SUCH AS- YOU KNOW. WHATEVER IT MAY BE I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY SO I THINK IT'S GOOD TO HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS AND LET THEM TAKE RIGHT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION FOR YOU AND THAT I HAVE BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUES YOU STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEXT ME SECOND PLACE IN THE QUEUE. I WANT TO GO TO MISS LANCE- IN A FEW MOMENTS WHY FANCY THIS LAST QUESTION. DOES TRAINING HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVILIAN AND LET ME- UP REPEAT THE QUESTION AGAIN AND THEN I'LL MAKE A COMMENT DOES TRAINING HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUST. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVILIANS OR THAT OR THE COMMUNITY- AND SO WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY OF MAY WOULD- CALL OLD SCHOOL WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT- OUR CHIEF LIEUTENANT. CAPTAIN THEY REQUIRED US TO GET OUT OF THE BOX GET OUT OF THE CAR. AND MEET THE NEIGHBORS WE DID COMMUNITY BASED POLICING. AS I SAID BEFORE I KNEW THE RODRIGUEZ FAMILY AND I KNEW WHAT KIDS WANT TO RODRIGUEZ FAMILIES AND THE GOOD THEY THE GARCIA FAMILY AND SO YOU AND WE KNEW EACH OTHER BY NAME. AND SO THERE WAS A LEVEL OF RESPECT THAT WHAT ON BOTH SIDES WHEN I WAS THERE. SO AGAIN THE QUESTION IS DOES THE TRAINING HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUST BETWEEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND CIVILIAN AND OUR COMMUNITY. YES IT DOES IT DOES IMPOSE THE ACADEMY. IT DOESN'T FEEL TRAINING IT DOESN'T VARIOUS INSERVICE TRAINING COURSES. I TOUCHED ON THE TINY ARMS AND WEARING THEIR MAIN THREE. WHICH IS- PRINCIPLE POLICING IN THE COMMUNITY IT ADDRESSES THOSE TOPICS PACIFIC ME. ON THE FIELD TRAINING MANUAL WHICH I BELIEVE YOU CAN FIND ONLINE ALSO ADDRESSES THOSE TOPICS. IN SERVICE TRAINING IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP TRAINING THAT WE PROVIDE. IN TERMS OF. AB FIRST PERSONAL JUSTICE IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT- TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY AND WHY TIMES THERE IS MISTRUST AND- TRYING TO WORK ON IMPROVING THAT. WE RECENTLY- ISSUE ESCALATION GUY I BELIEVE THEY WERE ISSUE IN AUGUST. OF THIS YEAR AS WELL AS USE OF FORCE STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES PURSUANT TO EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO AND SB TWO THIRTY. AND BOTH OF THOSE DOCUMENTS ADDRESS COMMUNITY TRUST AND HOW TO- THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY TRUST AND HOW TO WORK ON IMPROVING COMMUNITY TRUST. SO I BELIEVE WE DO IN TERMS OF TRADING AS WELL AS IN PUBLICATIONS ON IT WE REGULARLY PUT OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISS LANCE THANK YOU AGAIN FIRST I'M STAYING HERE AND- ANSWERING SOME OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND AGAIN MEMBERS- IF YOU. WANT TO PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL PUT YOU IN THE QUEUE- WHAT WOULD YOU DO WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER. IF YOU CAN GIVE ME THREE POINTS BECAUSE YOU COME FROM A DIFFERENT LANDS AS A COMMUNITY BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE- REFERENCE AN UNDERSCORE. YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ONE GO TO THE ACADEMY TO DO RIDE ALONGS AND ALSO GO TO THE ASSEMBLY TRAININGS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE- AS A CITIZEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. SO YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT WHAT THREE POINTS WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE WITH US THAT WE SOULD BE LOOKING AT- FROM WHAT FROM YOUR LANDS TO MAKE- A REIMAGINING LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. SO IF I MAY REAL QUICK I ALSO HAVE SIXTEEN HOURS OF POST CERTIFICATION TRAINING UP. THAT I RECEIVED OUT AT THE ACADEMY- SO JUST FOR A LITTLE CLARITY ON YOUR QUESTION ARE YOU ASKING MY OPINION FROM A LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE OR FROM AN OVERALL COMMUNITY. YEAH COMMITTEE PERSPECTIVE PLEASE SO- NUMBER ONE I THINK THAT WE MUST BE COGNITIVE AND AWARE OF THE TRUE HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY MMHM RELATED TO RACE RELATIONS AND HOW IT IMPACTS LAW ENFORCEMENT. NUMBER TWO THAT WE MUST BEGIN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY THAT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO. OTHER ONE ANOTHER THAT IT IS LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND THEN THERE IS THE CIVILIAN COMMUNITY- BECAUSE WITHIN THAT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THERE'S THE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO AND OR IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITY AND THEN THERE IS THE WHITE COMMUNITY- AND SO WE MUST BE MINDFUL THAT. A LOT OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ROOT OF IT ALL IS OUR BONDING AGENT OF HUMANITY THAT WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND ONCE WE CAN BEGIN TO SHAPE THE LANGUAGE. THAT HELPS TO FORMULATE THE THOUGHT PROCESSES THAT CHANGES THE OVERALL PERCEPTION THAT WE ARE ALL. ONE HUMAN RACE- I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE PROBLEMS AND SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO GO ROUND AND ROUND AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR POLICE REFORM BUT AGAIN AS I SAID- SOME OF THESE THINGS DON'T NEED TO BE REFORMED THEY NEED TO BE DECONSTRUCTED. AND THEY NEED TO BE RECONSTRUCTED INTO A SYSTEM THAT IS MORE INCLUSIVE OF EVERYONE- AND WE CANNOT FORGET THE FACT THAT- WE S. PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO THE DARK CORNERS OF BEING CRIMINALIZED BASED ON OUR MERE EXISTENCE IN THIS SOCIO ECONOMIC SOCIETY THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE DEAL WITH HAS BEEN SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED TO BE THAT WAY. AND THE MINDSETS OF THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE RE SHAPED AND RE FASHION TO UNDERSTAND THAT A PART OF THAT IS BEING INCLUSIVE OF ON ITS HISTORY. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- WITH THAT BEING SAID- I WANT TO- WE WANT AT THIS POINT TIME WE WANT TO GO INTO OUR- OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS- SEGMENT OF THE ARGENTA. BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN EVERY PRESENTER EVERY MEMBER EVERYONE WHO WOULD LEND THEIR VOICES- IN THIS CONVERSATION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- THE YOUR VOICE IT IS A FACT THE CONNECTICUT IN THIS PROCESS I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. NOW WE WILL GO TO- THE PUBLIC I WOULD ASK THAT ANYONE FROM THE COMMUNITY TO LAUGH WE HAVE TWO MINUTES DURING THIS SEGMENT TO PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE THAT'S BEHIND THE PLEXIGLASS PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE MICROPHONE WE WILL. ADJUSTED TO YOUR SPECIFICATION- SO THAT YOU CAN- SPEAK. WE WOULD ALSO INSTRUCT YOU THAT YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO LEAVE I'M AFTER YOU FINISH YOUR pCOMMENTS AND WE'LL HAVE WILL ESCORT YOU OUT OF THE BUILDING BECAUSE OF COLD IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS. IS PROTECTED- AND INTO OR YOU CAN JUST FEEL FREE TO HAVE A SEAT AND WE CAN ALL LIVE TOGETHER AT AT ONE TIME AND WE WANT TO ALSO MAKE MENTION TO AN ELEVATOR WHAT ONE PERSON ELEVATOR AT A TIME SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. THE PUBLIC PORTION OF THIS HEARING IS OPEN FOR TWO MINUTES. OF MISLED. SO THIS IS KIND OF OFF SUBJECT BUT I THINK IT IS STILL RELEVANT- YESTERDAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARTY WE WERE OUT FRONT AND WE WERE HAVING A PRESS CONFERENCE IN REGARDING TO KEEP THE SEAT. THE SENATE SEAT FORCE US INTO QUALIFIERS- WHAT WE TALK ABOUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN GROWING IN OUR COUNTRY FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY SINCE THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD- WE TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY- I THINK THAT IT IT. WE ARE AT A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY RIGHT NOW WHERE. WHILE WE TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY ESPECIALLY AROUND LAW ENFORCEMENT I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU AS I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE IN POSITIONS WHO REPRESENT US WHO ARE WHO HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF ACCOUNTABILITY- AND SO I AM ASKING YOU ALL. TO SUPPORT ME AND SUPPORTING PAUL HENDERSON FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S POSITION AS THE TOP COP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO HAVE REPRESENTATION WHO LOOK LIKE US BUT NOT JUST LOOK LIKE US BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO LOOKS LIKE US DOESN'T NECESSARILY. THINK LIKE WE DO- I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE AS WE TRANSITION AND WE CONTINUE AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO WELCOME IN A NEW PRESIDENT- AND VICE PRESIDENT THAT IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT I BELIEVE THE OVERALL AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE ON THAT TRAJECTORY AS WELL. AND SO I'M ASKING THAT YOU ALL AS MEMBERS- OF CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY SUPPORT ME IN SUPPORTING PAUL HENDERSON AS THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISHED TO ADDRESS THE BODY.

THAT WISHING TO SPEAK AND ADDRESS THIS BODY. PLEASE STEP TO THE MICROPHONE. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. MY NAME IS RYAN HARRISON I AM THE GENERAL COUNSEL- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF BLACK LAWYERS. I WANNA COME YOU GUYS ON THE DISK. TODAY A LOT OF GOOD MATERIAL- WAS DISCUSSED AND- OUR ORGANIZATIONS- CONTINUES TO STAND READY AND WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS ON POLICE REFORM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PART OF THAT THEM. REFORM MOVEMENT INCLUDES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- POSITION NOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BLACK LAWYERS HAS DISPATCHED. A SHORT LIST OF. HIGH LEVEL CONTENDER FOR THIS POSITION- TO THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE ULTIMATE DECISION- BY THE GOVERNOR FOR THAT POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. HI MY NAME IS MARISSA MORALIS- JUST WANNA THINK JIMMY LOVE FOR WRITING YOU TO BE HERE THANK YOU GUYS ON FOR HOSTING THIS. THIS COMMITTEE- FIRST OF ALL OF THAT I HAVE HIGH HARSH PERSPECTIVE REGARD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT SO I'M GLAD TO BE A PART OF THIS TOPIC- I KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A IT'S A VERY VERY DIFFICULT JOB IT'S HARD SALUTE. PLEASE TAKE MY COMMENTS IN MY- SUGGESTIONS YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT NOT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL OR ANYTHING- BUT- IN REGARDS TO THE- EDUCATION PIECE AND THE TRAINING PIECE- BEING A WAY TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS THE ANSWER ALTHOUGH EDUCATION IS GOOD AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE ENCOURAGED. YOU KNOW IT'S ALL ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGED- I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER I THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS ACCOUNTABILITY OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR CIVILIANS ALIKE. IF THERE IS YOU KNOW IF A LAW WAS BROKEN OR EXCESSIVE FORCE IS USED. THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE SO I THINK ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE FIRST THING THAT WILL BUILD TRUST WITH THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SECOND IS GETTING TO KNOW US GETTING FINALISED- BECAUSE THERE IS A DISCONNECT RIGHT NOW. AND AS OF RIGHT NOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW SOMEBODY. YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR COMMUNITY YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO ACTUALLY PROTECT AND TO SERVE THEM IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE- AND AGAIN IT CREATES THE US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY BECAUSE YOU FEAR. WHAT OR WHO YOU DON'T KNOW SO I THINK THAT'S NEEDS IT THAT'S KEY. ALSO- WITH THE EDUCATIONAL PIECE REQUIREMENT IT CAN. MAKE IT HARDER FOR MINORITIES TO MOVE UP THE SOCIAL MOBILITY LADDER SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'RE NOT MAKING IT A REQUIREMENT- BUT I DO LIKE THE TWO YEARS THAT YOU KNOW CHIEF HAN HAS IMPLEMENTED AND THAT THE AGENT CREASE- ANOTHER THING SUGGESTION THAT I HAVE FOR OUR AFFECT PD. AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE DONE THINGS REALLY GREAT THUS FAR HOWEVER. THEY'RE STILL AB- THERE'S STILL A PROBLEM WITH POLICE KILLING OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND SOUL WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS- ASSESSMENT TESTING I'M SURE GOES ON IN THE ACADEMY BUT IT NEEDS TO GO ON THROUGHOUT LIKE THE WHAT WOULD YOU DO CASE SCENARIOS SO IF THIS IF THIS TYPE OF THING WAS TO HAPPEN IF THERE'S A CRISIS SITUATION HOW WOULD THEY HANDLE IT SO THAT THEY'RE- THINKING BEFORE THEY ACT SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY. TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK IF IN THIS SITUATION IF THERE'S A PERSON WHO WAS ARMED HOW SHOULD I REACT VERSUS JUST. YOU KNOW REACTING BY SHOOTING- YOU KNOW JUST HAVE YEAH JUST MAKE IT MORE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ASSESSMENT AND SO THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION IS TO HAVE MORE CASE SCENARIOS AND- THINGS OF THAT NATURE THANK YOU.

I COMMITTEE AND- MISTER CHAIRPERSON BEER LUCIEN NEAR ON BEHALF OF THE- SAN FRANCISCO. POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION WHO REGRETS THAT THEY- THINK ONE ABLE TO ADJUST TO THE- THE RESCHEDULE TIME FRAME BUT- BUT NONETHELESS WANTED TO. CONVEY A FEW COMMENTS THROUGH ME- REGARDING- THIS THESE IMPORTANT TOPICS. I PERSONALLY FORMAL- I THINK THEY WANTED TO CONVEY THAT YOU CAN WAITING A LONG TIME TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION. ABOUT REFORMS RATHER THAN THE BILL BY BILL APPROACH SO MISTER CHAIRMAN WE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING YOUR DILIGENCE TO BRING ALL PARTIES TO THE TABLE ON THIS- AND ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL- ONE OF THE STATE- BELIEVE VERY IMPORTANT. TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY STRONGLY IN. THE IDEA OF ONGOING TRAINING- REALLY SORT OF BRANDING THAT UP IN A WAY. THAT JUST REALLY HADN'T BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. THE IMPORTANCE OF PERISHABLE SKILLS AND DOUBLING DOWN ON ENSURING THAT THOSE SKILLS ARE ARE KEPT- IN BETWEEN COULD TOP SHAPE. SO THAT OFFICERS WHEN THEY GET INTO THE MOMENT- BETTER VERY TENSE WHERE SOME INCOMING IS WHERE THEY JUST. SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO THINK- THAT DATE OF BIRTH SHE QUALITY TRAINING. THAT PRODUCES THE BEST OUTCOMES POSSIBLE- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE MUCH MORE OUR ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT SPECIFICS OF ONGOING TRAINING. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO. YES GOING SOME OF THE OTHER THING- WERE DISCUSS AND THEN THE SECOND THING THAT- WHAT IMPORTANT TO KNOW. IF IDEA OF EARLY POSITIVE INTERACTIONS- THERE'S AN INTEREST IN FIGURING OUT HOW WE INSTITUTIONALIZE THAT STATEWIDE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE EARLIER- COMMENTATORS WHO SUGGESTED. THAT YOU KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF STARTING EARLY. ON WE'VE ENTERED ENVIRONMENT HERE WHERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL BOARDS ACROSS THE STATE WHO ARE. EIGHTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OUT OF SCHOOL- AND PRECLUDING OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE VERY EARLY POSITIVE IN- INTERACTIONS WITH STUDENTS. I KNOW PERSONALLY MYSELF FOR THE- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL- KIDDING- WHEN WAS. THE L. A. COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE USED IN THE DEADLY BY- YOU KNOW EVERY OTHER WEEK TO YOU KNOW COME READ TO THE CLASS AT THE TALK ABOUT THEIR PROFESSION- SO I HAD. WE HAD THE BENEFIT OF IN ADDITION TO BEING SURROUNDED B FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WERE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT HAVE A SIMILARLY POSITIVE INTERACTION. INTEL I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD CONCUR WITH THAT- LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW THOSE INTERACTIONS- BUT OBVIOUSLY THE DYNAMIC AT PLAY- OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS IT MADE THAT CHALLENGING INTEL. OR HOPEFUL TO- TO DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT INSTITUTIONALIZING ARE POSITIVE INTERACTIONS AND ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE PUBLIC SO THAT WHEN.
