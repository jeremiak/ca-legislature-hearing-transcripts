THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FIRST LET ME JUST START BY ACCEPTING THE. COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. PA AB TWENTY YEAR TWENTY SIXTY FIVE UPDATES MY TWENTY FOURTEEN LEGISLATION AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS THE SURPLUS LAND ACT THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. ASKED THAT AS LOCAL AGENCIES DISPOSED OF SURPLUS LAND BUT THEY GIVE THE FIRST PRIORITY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. THE REASON THAT WE ARE UPDATING THIS IS WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD FLOOD NUMBER JURISDICTIONS TRY TO CIRCUMVENT THE STATE LAW AND WE FEEL THAT. THIS WELL FURTHER CLARIFY OUR PURPOSE AND ACTUALLY STOP THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD THAT OPENED THE CITY COUNCIL ARGUED. THAT A PARCEL AND WITHOUT SUBJECT TO THE SURPLUS WHEN THAT BECAUSE THE LAND WAS FORMERLY OWNED BY A REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY. IN SAN JOSE. OF THE CITY TOOK A STEP THAT THE CHARTER CITY THAT THEY COULD ADOPTED ORDINANCE THAT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED THE REQUIREMENTS. OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT AS YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS AND IN PARTICULAR WERE IN THE MIDST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. WE FELT BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THE LEGISLATION THAT THIS WAS ON. THE WAY TO CREATE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN A COST EFFICIENT WAY AND WE STILL STAND BY THAT AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY ARE FOR AB TWENTY SIXTY FIVE WITH THAT I'VE TWO WITNESSES. WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MY NAME IS JEFFREY LOOK AND I AM THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH EAST BAY HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS. WE ARE A MEMBER BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT DOES EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY TO PROTECT PRESERVE AND. S. BEYOND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND TODAY. PRIOR TO WORKING FOR EPO I SPENT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND IS THE HOUSING POLICY AND PROGRAMS MANAGER SO I HAVE. HAD SOME EXPERIENCE ON THIS ISSUE ON BOTH SIDES. I'M WE FIRST WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING FOR INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION. THE SURPLUS LAND ACT CAN BE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR PROVIDING URGENTLY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND WE APPRECIATE EFFORTS TO CLARIFYING AND STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING PROVISIONS IN THE LAW. AS WE'VE NOTED IN THE COMMENT LETTER THAT WE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED IN THE COURSE OF OUR WORK WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW. DESPITE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE THAT ITS PROVISIONS APPLY EQUALLY TO GENERAL LAW AND CHARTER CITIES AS MR TING SAID. THERE'S A BIG DISPUTE AND LITIGATION PENDING WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE THAT HAS HAVE BROADER RAMIFICATIONS THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. ON HAS BEEN TRYING TO LINK DISCRETIONARY TRANSPORTATION FUNDING TO. POSITIVE PERFORMANCE ON A HOUSING PRODUCTION AND SOUGHT TO LINK DISCRETIONARY FUNDING TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE SURPLUS LAND ACT BUT BECAUSE OF THIS. DISPUTE WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE RIGHT NOW THAT LINKAGE ONLY APPLIES TO GENERAL LAWS CITIES. AND THEY'VE HELD IT IN ARM ABEYANCE FOR A CHARTER CITIES. THREE YEARS AGO IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND THE CITY CLAIMS THAT LAND BEING OFFERED FOR SALE TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER OF MARKET RATE HOUSING WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE SURPLUS LAND ACT BECAUSE IT WAS FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY LAND. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSFER OF THE PROPERTY FROM THE CITY TO READ TO THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY WAS INVALID AND D. O. F. WAS ACTUALLY ORDERING THAT IT BE CLAWED BACK. AND THEREFORE WAS CLEARLY CITY OWNED PLANT. MORE RECENTLY THE CITY OF OAKLAND CLAIMS THAT A CITY OWNED PARCEL BEING OFFERED TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER WAS NOT SURPLUS LAND BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATUTORY LANGUAGE REFERS TO LAND THAT IS QUOTE. DETERMINES% TO BE NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR THE AGENCIES USE. THE CITY CLAIMED THAT SINCE IT HAD NEVER USED TO PLANT IT DIDN'T FIT THE TEST OF NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR THE CITY'S USE AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NO OBLIGATION TO GO THROUGH THE ON. PROCEDURES OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. TRANSIT AGENCIES SEEKING DISPOSABLE LAND FOR DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMED THAT BECAUSE FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY IN STATE LAW DEFINED JOINT DEVELOPMENT AS A TRANSIT RELATED USE SUCH DISPOSITION STILL QUALIFIES AS BEING USED BY THE AGENCY AND THEREFORE. DEVELOPMENT OF OFFICE AND RETAIL SPACE FOR EXAMPLE IS PERMITTED WITHOUT NEEDING TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURES OF THE PLUS LAND ACT. WE HAVE SEEN EFFORTS TO DEFINE SALE OF WAY ON FOR ANY BROADLY DEFINED PUBLIC PURPOSE SUCH AS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR REVENUE GENERATION AS NOT BEING SURPLUS LAND. THERE'S BEEN CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO GIVE PRIORITY TO PROPOSALS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO ASSIST MEAN THAT IN AGENCIES SHOULD FIRST NEGOTIATE EXCLUSIVELY WITH DEVELOPERS PROPOSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OR JUST AT THE CITY IN THE COURSE OF A COMPETITION SHOULD AWARD A COUPLE OF EXTRA POINTS TO ANYBODY PROPOSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND LASTLY WE'VE SEEN ATTEMPTS TO USE THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS ITSELF TO DIRECT OR LIMIT THE. FINAL USE OF THE LAND. INCLUDING SAYING WELL WE ONLY WANT A HOTEL HERE WE ONLY WANT TO SEE. RETAIL DEVELOPMENT HERE DESPITE THE STATUTE CLEARLY STATING THAT NEGOTIATION SHOULD FOCUS ON SALES PRICE OR LEASE TERMS AND THAT IT IS FAILURE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THESE POINTS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE AGENCY TO THEN PROCEED. WITH SALE TO OTHER ENTITIES. THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED IN THIS BILL WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD CLARIFYING IN RESOLVING THESE AMBIGUITIES AND LOOPHOLES AND SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD. PROVIDE CLARITY ABOUT WHICH AGENCIES ARE COVERED BY THE LAW. BETTER DEFINE SURPLUS LAND AS ANY PUBLICLY OWNED PLANTS NOT NEEDED FOR THE PUBLIC AGENCIES OWN GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS AND ESTABLISH A PRESUMPTION THAT PUBLIC LAND IS SURPLUS PROPERTY WHEN THE PUBLIC ENTITY INITIATES ACTION TO DISPOSE OF IT. BILL WOULD STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR NOTIFYING QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC LAND MAKING THAT PROCESS EASIER FOR BOTH DEVELOPERS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES RIGHT NOW. ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SPONSORS MUST NOTIFY IN ADVANCE EVERY PUBLIC AGENCY IN THEIR SERVICE AREA OF THEIR DESIRE TO I'M HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BID ON. SURPLUS LAND BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW THAT THE LAND IS BEING OFFERED THIS IS INCREDIBLY BURDEN SUMMIT ALSO REQUIRES SCORES OF AGENCIES TO TRACK THIS. ON THE BILL PROPOSES INSTEAD TO HAVE A CENTRAL REGISTRY WITH EACH ARM COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. THERE'S A CENTRAL REPOSITORY. THE BILL WOULD SPECIFY THAT NEGOTIATION SHOULD FOCUS ON SALE OR HOME LEASE PRICE IN TERMS AND NOT THE DETAILS OF HOW THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. IT WOULD I CLARIFY WHAT IT MEANS TO GRANT PRIORITY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPOSALS. I'M AND WOULD CLARIFY FOR THAT IF NEGOTIATIONS FAIL ON THERE'S A PROVISION NOW THAT ANY HOUSING DEVELOP SHOULD BE FIFTEEN PERCENT AFFORDABLE THE ARM. BILL NOW WOULD CLARIFY THAT IF NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPOSALS THAT COME FORWARD BUT THE PROPERTY IS SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED FOR HOUSING THAN THAT FIFTEEN PERCENT WOULD REPLY. SO THESE PROVISIONS IMPROVE ON THE EXISTING STATUTE WITHOUT IMPOSING SIGNIFICANT NEW RESPONSIBILITIES ARE REQUIREMENTS ON PUBLIC AGENCIES AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE IS FACING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING EMERGENCY ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. ENSURING THAT SURPLUS PUBLIC LAND IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS OF THE UTMOST ARE IMPORTANCE WE URGE YOU TO PASS THIS MEASURE OUT OF COMMITTEE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR CURRY MEMBERS MICHAEL AND WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA. A PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU THAT TODAY AND I WOULD JUST SAY VERY BRIEFLY THAT THE STE SURPLUS LAND ACTED ON THE BOOKS FOR DECADES. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO WORK MISTER TANK TO TO STRENGTHEN THAT AND REALLY TRY TO IMPLEMENT IT OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OF A ABOUT TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL AND FOUND ISSUES. THIS SECTOR TO CLARIFY THE STATUTE BECAUSE THE ONLY REMEDY THAT WE HAVE REALLY IT'S A COMPLAINT DRIVEN PROCESS AND WOULD REQUIRE LITIGATION WE DON'T WANT TO GO THERE WE THINK IT'S BETTER JUST TO HAVE. MORE CLARITY IN THE LAW SO THAT IT'S A JURISDICTIONS AND DISTRICT KNOW HOW HOW IT OPERATES AND TO BE ABLE TO DO SO AND WE ARE SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE THIS TO SUPPORT IF YOU JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND IF YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION PLEASE. THREE MEN TURKEY'S DONE HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE FOR SUPPORT. NEW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BOB FROM. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M BROWN JR VASI WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. AND WE ARE REGRET REGRETTABLY OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED TO THE MEASURE. OUR OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE APPLICATION OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT TO LEASES. I'D THIS COULD BE VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT DO HAVE VALID REASONS TO LEASE OR OTHERWISE PROTECT THE LAND THEY OWN. FIRST FOR INSTANCE WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS I'D. CONSERVATION EASEMENTS ARE ARE TYPICALLY USED TO PROTECT SENSITIVE SPECIES OR TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT THEY FACE ANOTHER. AYE POTENTIAL I USE OF LEASES WOULD BE SHORT TERM WE SEEN OUGHT TO USE PROPERTY PENDING FUTURE FACILITIES NEEDS. AS WE PASSED THE AUTHORED CONSUMING TOO I CONSIDER AMENDING THE DEFINITION TO APPLY ONLY TO THE SALE OF SURPLUS LAND. WE ALSO ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS THAT PUBLIC IN SEIZE. ONLY BE REQUIRED TO OFFER LAND THAT IS CONSIDERED SUITABLE FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. UP WE'VE HEARD FROM ONE OF OUR MEMBERS THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO OFFER UP BUT FOR LAND LOCATED NEXT TO WASTEWATER FACILITIES. AND WE SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO CONSTRUCT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINALLY THE CAN ALSO BE GOOD REASONS FOR AN AGENCY TO IT. TO HAVE INFORMAL NEGOTIATION AND IF THE AGENCY COMPLIES THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. BY PROVIDING NOTICE AND NEGOTIATION IN GOOD FAITH THAT SHOULD BE ALL THAT IS REQUIRED. WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR FOR WORKING WITH US IN THE BILL SO FAR. AND WE BELIEVE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED TO INCREASE THE LAND AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ALSO MAINTAINING FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL AGENCIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHERS WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. HIGH ON MY GROUPS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALVARY MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AND WE TACKLE THE CONCERNS OF THE SPECIAL DISTRICT ASSOCIATION AND APPRECIATE THE THE AUTHORED STAFF AND SPONSORS FOR.

I BELIEVE THAT'S THE ONLY AMENDMENT YOU'VE ASKED ME TO TAKE. ALRIGHT THEN AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY EIGHT INCREASES THE FINES CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN LEVEL LEVY. AGAINST BUILDING PROPERTY OWNERS FOR VIOLATIONS OF LOCAL BUILDING AND SAFETY CODE VIOLATIONS. THIS BILL ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO DEVELOP A HARDSHIP WAIVER. CITY'S ALL OVER CALIFORNIA STRUGGLE WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH BLIGHTED AND ABANDONED BUILDINGS WHEN PROPERTY COUNTIES REFUSED TO MAINTAIN THEIR PROPERTY. OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. IT LEADS TO AN ACCUMULATION OF DEBRIS AND PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERN CHURCHES BREAK INS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND EVEN FIRES. AND SOME OF THESE CAN BE VERY DESTRUCTIVE. IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT ACROSS A PATIO. FROM MY DISTRICT OFFICE IN HAYWARD. THERE IS AN ABANDONED COMMERCIAL PROPERTY WHICH HAS BEEN ABANDONED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. I IT'S ELEVEN STORY BUILDING AND. WE.

TURNED OUT STRONGER TOOLS TO DEAL WITH THIS AND AND THIS WILL WILL GIVE US SOME OF THOSE ARE STAFF ESTIMATES THAT WE DID IT THAT ABANDONED PROBABILITIES AND PRIVATE PROPERTY AND HEY WERE GENERATE OVER TWO HUNDRED. COMPLAINTS A YEAR AND OFTEN THESE INVOLVE CALLS FOR SERVICE FROM OUR PUBLIC SERVICE ARE YOU KNOW. PUBLIC PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCIES OUR POLICE AND FIRE A WE'RE NOT ABLE TO RECOVER THESE COSTS. AND IT SEEMS OF MINDS ARE SO LOW THAT THE PROPERTY OWNERS IT JUST DOESN'T GET THEIR ATTENTION. AND. AND YOU KNOW I THINK. ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THIS LAND IS SO NEEDED AND THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS FOR THIS ELEVEN STORY BUILDING TO BE TURNED INTO A MUCH NEEDED HOUSING MULTI FAMILY RENTAL HOUSING THAT WE REALLY NEED. THE OWNER JUST DOESN'T WANT TO SELL IT DE SATISFIED WITH THE STATUS QUO WE NEED TO GET HIS ATTENTION WILL AND AND THIS IS TRUE OF MANY PROPERTIES IN OUR CITY SO. BY.

THAT WOULD STORE REVENUES PREVIOUSLY ADVOCATE ALLOCATED TO CITIES THAT ANNEXED UNINHABITED I'M SORRY. INHABITED TERRITORIES. HAD PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF SB EIGHTY NINE. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SP EIGHTY NINE A PREVIOUS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. WAS PASSED DURING STATE BUDGET DIFFICULTIES. THIS LEGISLATION IN EFFECT SWEPT AWAY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN VEHICLE LICENSE FEE REVENUES FROM CITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AS A PART OF THIS CHANGE MANY OF THOSE AFFECTED WERE NEWLY INCORPORATED AREAS AND CITIES THAT HAD AMEX THOSE NEW TERRITORIES. THIS BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ULTIMATELY LOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE. THERE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ANNEXING CITIES WHO LOST REVENUE DUE TO THE LEGISLATION. INCLUDING MY CITY THE CITY OF FONTANA. FONTANA IN MY DISTRICT WHICH LOSES OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. FOR ANNEXING CITIES MANY OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY CASH STRAPPED. THE LOS OF THIS CRITICAL SOURCE OF FUNDING HURTS THE RESIDENTS. CITY'S PUT IN THIS POSITION OFTEN MOST CUT CRITICAL SERVICES SUCH IS INVESTING IN LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE FOR WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE AN INCOMPLETE BUDGET. ANOTHER PRACTICAL EFFECT OF LOCAL LAW. CURRENT LAW IS THE REDUCTION OF INTEREST IN ANNEXATION. GIVEN THE LIMITATIONSREGARDING NEW REVENUE THEY ARE. THEY'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO OBTAIN AS A RESULT OF SB EIGHTY NINE CITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEE ANNEXATION AS BURDENSOME. WELL WE DON'T GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TOOLS NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR RESIDENTS WE ARE ACTIVELY CREATING A DISINCENTIVE FOR ANNEXATION. WE MUST EMPOWER OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION IS ACQUITTED A WORN MAYOR OF SAN BERNADINE KNOW. AS WELL AS DAN CARRICK. WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WHO ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE THIRTY NINE WHICH SEEKS TO IMPROVE WATER SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA'S. MANY CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVED THEIR DRINKING WATER FROM SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN. THE THESE TROUBLE SYSTEMS OFTEN LACK RESOURCES TO FUND THE ONGOING COSTS AND MAINTENANCE OF OTHER LIKE OTHER. WATER AGENCIES AND ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE. SMALL TROUBLED WATER SYSTEMS CAN BE OVERCOME. CAN OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES BY CONSOLIDATING WITH NEIGHBORING SYSTEMS CONSOLIDATED WATER SYSTEMS CAN SHARE COSTS AND PROVIDE BETTER WATER SERVICE. THROUGH CONNIE OF SCALE. ALTHOUGH SOME CITIES. WE WANT TO VOLUNTARILY I'M CONSOLIDATE THEIR TROUBLED WATER SYSTEM THERE ARE BARRIERS TO CONSOLIDATION. ONE VARIAS THAT IS COSTLY THE COST OF HOLDING A FULL BLOWN ELECTION TO APPROVE THE SALE OF A SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. UNDER EXISTING LAW EVEN IF THE CITY HAS A WATER SYSTEM WITH ONLY TEN SERVICE CONNECTIONS A COMPLETE ELECTION WOULD BE. NEEDED BEFORE THE SYSTEM COULD BE SOLD WHILE THE COST TO HOLD AN ELECTION ON MAY NOT BE SIGNIFICANT FOR LARGER CITIES. ARE THEY CAN BE COSTLY AND VERY EXPENSIVE TO TAXPAYERS IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES THEREFORE THIS BILL WILL SEEK TO MODIFY THE ELECTION REQUIREMENT AND ALLOW CITIES. TO SELL THEIR SMALL. PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IF IT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS ARM OF THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. OF THESE CHANGES WILL PROVIDE MORE CALIFORNIANS WITH CLEANER AND SAFER DRINKING WATER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY NINE I HAVE MISTER HAWK HERE. FROM THE CALIFORNIA WATER SO CA SEEN WHO WILL. INTRODUCE HIMSELF AS WELL AS PROVIDES SUPPORTING TESTIMONY FOR THE BILL. I'M. MADAM CHAIR NOT MEMBERS THANK YOU MY NAME'S JACK HAWKS. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA WATER SOCIAIS XIN. ONE I THINK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS. IMPORTANT TOPIC. HIS BILL WILL ADD ANOTHER ARROW TO THE QUIVER. OF THE STATE'S. CAN WATER UTILITY CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT WILL HELP THE SMALL MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEMS. THAT ARE IN. HAVING A SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY IN THAT MAINTAINING KEEPING UP THEIR SYSTEMS AND. AND. MAKING A NEEDED NEW INVESTMENTS AND TRYING TO KEEP THEIR RATES DOWN. AND THE. THIS WITH THE CONSOLIDATION IN THIS STATE WITH THE POLICY WITH THE STATE'S POLICY IT NEEDS OPTION MELODY IN THIS BILL. IS A DEFINITELY PROVIDING ONE OF THOSE THAT THAT NEEDED OPTIONS. BUT THE BEST NEWS IS THAT FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS OF A A TROUBLED SMALL SYSTEM THAT GET CONSOLIDATED NOT ONLY WILL THEY GET WATER UP TO STANDARDS BUT THERE THE SIMPSON'S WILL BE UP TO STANDARD. AND. THEY. ECONOMIES OF SCALE. POINT THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST MADE IS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS WHOLE CONSOLIDATION EFFORTS SO. AND. COULD I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE. A CONSULTANT ON THE. ANALYSIS HE'S GOT IT EXACTLY RIGHT SO. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS AND. WE. AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOARING WILL ALSO SUPPORT. SEEING NONE OTHER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU HAVE A MOTION FROM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA SECOND BY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WALDRON. OR CHECK TO CLOSE. WELL I HAVE A QUESTION. MY OKAY WHICH OF GO AHEAD. THE BILL STATES THE CITY. AND I'M WONDERING IF IT'S JUST A IN ORDER AGENTS. SAID THERE'S A CITY THAT HAS ITS OWN WATER DISTRICT IN A VERY SMALL. WATER AGENCY. COULD THE CITY WITH SIDE WITHIN. YES WHAT'S WITHIN THE GENERAL PLAN AREA YES SOME OF IT WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS THAT'S CORRECT SO THIS. COULD THE CITY COUNCIL BY FOUR OUT OF FIVE COUNCIL MEMBERS VOTE. TO. CONSOLIDATE WITH THE SMALL WATER AGENCY THAT'S PART OF THE CITY ABSOLUTE BUT NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE CITY HAS ITS OWN WATER DISTRICT. YES RIGHT. THAT IS CORRECT THAT THE IDEA SO WHAT IF THESE. I'M SORRY TO ASK THIS QUESTION OF AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR MY DISTRICT BECAUSE I HAVE THE SCENARIO. WHAT IF THE SMALL WATER DISTRICT DOES NOT ONE TO BE CONSOLIDATED? NO THIS KNOW THIS I MEAN I'M SORRY SORRY YOU GOT IT BECAUSE. IT. YOU WANT TO THE FIRST KNUCKLE. YEAH SO THIS IS ONLY WITH WILLING PARTIES. THIS ONE ENFORCE ANY OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE WATER SYSTEM TO CONSOLIDATE FORCEFULLY IT'S STRICTLY BETWEEN VOLUNTARY WILLING PARTIES. CONCENTRIC YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHERE. NO BECAUSE THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS THE CITY IF THOUSAND INDICATING. RIGHT TO SEPARATE STATE AND THEY THINK THE CITY'S GOVERNING BODY. WOULD HAVE TO PASS A RESOLUTION AND FIRST FIND IT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THAT THE IS THE SYSTEM. IS. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUT IN POSITION OF BEING A. CONSOLIDATED WITH ANOTHER SO. RIGHT CONSENTING PARTIES I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY HAD THE SHORT AND WAITED. TO EXPLAIN THIS. INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO AGREE YEAH. MY. I MIGHT LIKE TO TAKE MY OFF AGAIN I'M SORRY. I THINK I'M JUST GONNA LAY OFF RIGHT NOW AND THE. SO WE HAVE A SUCH A LIE ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. SO I'VE I'VE RUSHED YOU ARE YOU OKAY. DOMINGUEZ. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OKAY.

RODRIQUEZ AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTEEN AT THE CITY OF MONCLER AS A VOTING MEMBER. OF THE METRO PHOTO GOAL LIKE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY BROKE GROUND TO EXTEND THE GOAL LINE INTO THE CITY MONCLER WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. FOR MY COMMUNITY THE GOAL LINE MEANS MORE JOBS MORE DEVELOPMENT AND FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD IN A REGION THAT SUFFERS FROM. SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION. NOW THAT THE PROJECT IS MOVING FORWARD. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE CITY AMONG HER HAVE A VOTING SEAT ON THE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY BOARD. AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM COUNCIL MEMBER BILL ROUTE THE CITY OF MONTCLAIR HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT TIME AND MONEY PREPARING FOR THE GOLD LINE. CITY MARKER HAS BEEN A CONTINUOUS SUPPORT OF THE GOAL LINE. AND IS THE ONLY CITY IN THE SOMEBODY ON COUNTY AFFECTED BY THE PROJECT. ADDING THEM AS A VOTING MEMBER TO THE BOARD IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME. HERE WITH ME TO TO FIND SUPPORT. IS MARKER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER BILL ROOM. BOB. WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ FOR THIS. BILL. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTEEN. THE CITY OF MONTCLAIR. TRULY BELIEVES. AND THE GOLD LINE. AND MASS TRANSIT. WE BELIEVE IN THIS SO MUCH THAT WE'VE DECIDED. AND HAD ADVANCED. THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE METRO GOLD LINE FOOTHILL CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY. THIS WAS DONE ON BEHALF OF THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. WITH ADVANCEDCONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING. AND CONSULTING WORK. AND IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT WITH ANY LOCAL CITY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT SOME. ADDITIONALLY AS A CITY. WE'VE REZONED AN AREA DIRECTLY AROUND THE TRANSIT CENTER. WITH A GOLD LINE. HOPEFULLY PASS THROUGH. YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TRANSIT ORIENTED. DEVELOPMENT AT MUCH HIGHER DENSITIES. THESE DENSITIES ON AVERAGE OR THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY UNITS. ACRE. THEY FULLY EMBRACE TRANSIT ORIENTED PRINCIPLES. MIXED USE PRINCIPLES. AND. BUILT INTO THEM. GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THAT TIES TOGETHER. BECAUSE OF THIS. THERE'S BEEN OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EXPENDED BETWEEN THE CITY OF MONTCLAIR. AND THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY. I'M LAND IMPROVEMENT. I ACQUISITION STUDIES I'VE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. AND IN NEW CONSTRUCTION. TIFFANY. THIS IS PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS FOR BUSINESS PEOPLE TO LOCATE AND FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY MOVE CLOSE. TO A TRANSIT STATION. THE GOAL LINE IS VITAL TO MONTCLAIR AND FOR THE REGION. BUT ESPECIALLY FOR A LOWER INCOME FAMILIES WHO NEED SAFE. RELIABLE. COST EFFECTIVE TRANSPORTATION TO HELP THE ACCESS. JOBS EDUCATIONAL AS WELL AS CULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES. ACROSS THE AREA. WE DO HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL ADVANCE THIS BILL AND IF AT ANYTIME YOU SHOULD NEED. ANY QUESTIONS OR NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I'M MORE THAN HAPPY. TO PROVIDE IT. WE DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE TRULY HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL PASS THANK YOU. ALL THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. STEVE BAKER WITH THEIR NEEDS ASSOCIATES FOR THE METRO GOLD LINE FOOTHILL EXTENSION CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY. IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE FIRST OF ALL WE DO APPRECIATE THE ON GOING SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ AND THE CITY OF MONTCLAIR FOR THE PROJECT IS THEY'VE OUTLINED. HOWEVER WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME. JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GOLD MINE THE GOLD LINE IS A SPECIAL PURPOSE PUBLIC AGENCY. THAT WAS CREATED FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF BUILDING A LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. THEY'VE COMPLETED THE LOOK PHASE ONE OF THE PROJECT FROM DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES TO PASADENA. THEY'VE COMPLETED PHASE TWO OF THE PROJECT FROM PASADENA TO OF SOUSA. ANOTHER EMBARKING ON PHASE THREE OF THE PROJECT HAS BEEN OUTLINED BY ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ. THE EXTENSION IS OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PROJECT WITH THE TERMINUS IN MONTCLAIR. ONCE THE GOLD LINE FINISHES CONSTRUCTION THEY TURN OVER OPERATIONS TO LA METRO AND ONLY METROS ARE FUNDING PARTNER FOR THE PROJECT. WE HAVE THREE ISSUES WITH THIS BILL ONE OF THEM IN THE FIRST OF THEM. IS THAT WE THINK THAT THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION TO ASSEMBLE MEDINA COUNTY. THE GOLD MINE CURRENTLY HAS FIVE VOTING MEMBERS AND FOR NON VOTING MEMBERS. WITH THE EXTENSION TO MONTCLAIR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE PROJECT IN SYMBOL MEDINA WILL BE SIX PERCENT OF THE PROJECT. HOWEVER ONE OF THE. VOTING MEMBERS CURRENTLY IS FROM SIMBA MEDINA COUNTY SO THEY'VE CURRENTLY GOT TODAY THE TWENTY PERCENT VOTE ON THE BOARD. THIS WOULD INCREASE THAT THIRTY THREE PERCENT ON THE BOARD. I'M ALSO CURRENTLY TODAY ONE OF THE NON VOTING MEMBERS IS FROM SAM OR DID YOU KNOW COUNTY. WE THINK THAT THE GOLD LINES DONE A GOOD JOB OF REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF SAMBOR MEDINA COUNTY IN THEIR COMMITTED TO GOING TO MONTCLAIR. HOME AND WE'VE OUTLINED THAT AS I'VE MENTIONED. ALSO WE FEEL THAT THE BILL COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE SOME SIGNIFICANT. ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO THE PROJECT THE GOAL LINE HIS PRE QUALIFIED A DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTORS WERE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING OUT TO BID FOR THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE CONTRACTORS ARE UNSURE OF WHAT THEY'RE BIDDING ON OR WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD IS WERE CONCERNED THAT MIGHT LEAD TO. ADDITIONAL RISK TO THE PROJECT AND THAT ADDITIONAL MITT RISK COULD. POTENTIALLY HAVE THE IMPACT OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO GO TO MONK CLEAR WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THEN FINALLY WE THINK THAT THE BILL'S PRE MATURITY HER COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OUTLINED THIS PRETTY WELL. SO FAR WELL MONK CLEAR HAS PUT UP SOME MONEY FOR PLANNING THERE'S NO FINANCIAL COMMITMENT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT WE THINK THAT UNTIL THERE'S A. BETTER FINANCIAL AGREEMENT ON GOING INTO A SYMBOL MEDINA COUNTY IT'S PREMATURE TO THE. AND ADD ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIVES TO THE BOARD AND SO FOR THOSE THREE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M ISRAEL WILL FUND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN MEDINA TRANSPORTATION SOME REAL COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. ó OUR AGENCY HAS TAKEN AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTEEN. WHAT WE FULLY SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ IS EFFORTS TO ADD THE CITY OF MONTCLAIR'S VOICE TO THE BOARD? AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR VOICE IS A VOTING MEMBER IS EQUALLY IF NOT MORE SIGNIFICANT. THE CONVERSION OF OUR CURRENT EX OFFICIO NONVOTING SEAT TO THE GOAL LINE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDING INPUT ON ITEMS AFFECTING SAMBAR MEDINA COUNTY. AS WE ARE PROJECTED TO CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT OF THE PROJECT. AND THEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ONGOING CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE IN PERPETUITY. THE CURRENT MAKE UP OF THE GOAL LINE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY PASADENA SOUTH PASADENA LOS ANGELES LA METRO IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. HAVE DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY OVER A PROJECT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND WILL UNLESS MODIFIED HAVE THE SAME AUTHORITY OVER THE PHASE OF THE PROJECT THAT HIS PROPOSED TO BE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH GLENDORA SAN DEMI'S LA VERNE POMONA CLAREMONT. AND MONTCLAIR. LIKE LOS ANGELES AND WOULD YOU KNOW COUNTY IS A SELF HELP COUNTY. RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMITTING A BIT MINISTERING A LOCAL SALES TAX DEDICATED TO TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT IN THE COUNTY. AND LIKE LOS ANGELES THE TAXPAYERS OF SAMBOR TO DINO COUNTY DESERVE REPRESENTATION AS A VOTING MEMBER. HOW ON THE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROJECT IS USED IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LOCAL SALES TAX MEASURE? WE WOULD URGE A NO VOTE TODAY UNLESS THE BILL AS AMENDED TO ADD THIS AMBER TO DINO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS ANYONE ELSE IN. A PROPOSITION OF THE SPILL. BAKE YOU CURE US ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PASADENA ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR SOME OF THE REASONS THAT BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. WE HAVE. YES MR UP VOEPEL ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST A QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE. ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT. BECAUSE THEY ONE ANOTHER ACTIVE BOARD MEMBER THAT'S WHERE I UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT CORRECT.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE MISTER MAYNES. THANK YOU VENTURE IN MEMBERS AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY SEVEN. WOULD GIVE RIVERSIDE COUNTY REGIONAL PARK IN OPEN SPACE DISTRICT THE SAME PURCHASING POWER AS OTHER DEPARTMENTS. I TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AT THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE NEED TO INCREASE THE GENERAL MANAGERS PURCHASING LIMIT TO MATCH OTHER COUNTY DIVISION HAD LIMITS. OVER TIME COST INCREASES HAVE EFFECTIVELY REDUCED THE DISTRICTS PURCHASING POWER. INCREASING THE NO BID PURCHASING AUTHORITY TO FIFTY THOUSAND COMPENSATES FOR THE RISING GENERAL COSTS OF THE DISTRICT. I WOULD BETTER SUPPORT THE DISTRICT'S MISSION BY ELIMINATING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR SMALL PROJECTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY REPRESENTATIVES HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS AND. I CAN HELP ANSWERQUESTIONS AS WELL FATE WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M ELIZABETH HAS BEEN US ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. RIFF CHO PARKS AS IT'S AFFECTIONATELY AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS A DEPENDENT HOW SPECIAL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES OFFERING THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY AND ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT. I HAVE. WITH ME TODAY MAKING GOMEZ WHO'S THE FINANCE MANAGER OF THE PERKS DISTRICT AND SHE CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF THE SPECIFICS THANK YOU. BOTH OF. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MEGAN GóMEZ I AM THE FISCAL MANAGER FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY REGIONAL PARK AND OPEN SPACE DISTRICT. AND. AS MENTIONED WERE KNOWN AS REV CHO PARKS SO I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHY WE ARE MAKING THIS REQUEST. FIRST I COUNTY PARKS WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY THROUGH THE VOTERS APPROVAL. AND OUR MISSION IS TO ACQUIRE PROTECT DEVELOP MANAGE AND INTERPRET FOR THE INSPIRATION USE AND ENJOYMENT OF ALL PEOPLE IT WELL BALLOT SYSTEM OF PARK RELATED PLACES. OF. OUTSTANDING SCENIC RECREATIONAL AND HISTORIC IMPORTANCE. OUR SYSTEM FEATURES OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES THAT INCLUDES REGIONAL PARKS THAT HAVE CAMPING AND FISHING AND OTHER AMENITIES. WE ALSO HAVE HISTORIC SITES ECOLOGICAL RESERVES A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE MILES OF TRAILS AND COUNTING. AT A STATE OF THE ART SPORTS PERKY AND ALSO ACTIVELY MANAGED ECOLOGICAL HABITATS IN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS. ON A TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE WERE RECEIVED ACCREDITATION OF A NATIONAL STATUS FROM CAP ROW WHICH IS KEY. OTHER COMMISSION FOR ACCREDITATION OF PARK AND RECREATION AGENCIES A FOR DEMONSTRATING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF STANDARDS IN ETHICAL AND PERFORM OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES. IN THE DELIVERY OF PARK AND REC PROGRAMS. I WE'RE THE SECOND AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA BEHIND THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TO RECEIVE THIS NATIONAL ACCREDITATION. AND THE FIRST COUNTY IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA TO RECEIVE THE HONOR. SO WE HOLD OURSELVES TO VERY HIGH STANDARDS AND WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH SUPERIOR PARKS AND SERVICES. SO NOW ON TO THE DETAILS AS TO WHY WE'RE REQUESTING. THIS INCREASE OUR PURCHASING POWER. THE NRP A WHICH IS THE NATIONAL PARK AND RECREATION AGENCY THEY PUBLISH AN ANNUAL AGENCY YOU PERFORMANCE REVIEW REPORTS THAT COMPILES STATISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN VOLUNTARILY SUBMITTED BY. PARK AND REC AGENCIES ALL ACROSS THE NATION AND REPORTS ON TRENDS AND PLUS A SPECIFIC STATISTICS AND STANDARDS. THE RECENTLY RELEASED TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORTS. REPORTED THAT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OPERATING EXPENDITURES FOR PARKS AND REC AGENCIES IS AROUND THREE POINT THREE MILLION. RIFF CHO PARKS IS THAT EIGHTEEN MILLION. WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND THERE ARE SEVEN OTHER CALIFORNIA AGENCIES THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO OURS. AND HERE'S WHERE THE INTERESTING STATISTICS COME INTO PLAY. AND IT RELATES TO OPERATING EXPENDITURES PER CAPITA. THE OTHER CALIFORNIA AGENCIES WHO REPORTED THEIR EXPENDITURES ARE SPENDING ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX DOLLARS FOR EVERY TEN THOUSAND OF THEIR CITIZENS. RIFF CHO PARKS WE HAVE ONLY EIGHT DOLLARS PER TEN THOUSAND CITIZENS. SO THAT RIGHT THERE SHOULD SHOW YOU THAT WE'RE OPERATING ON A SHOE STRING BUDGETS BUT YET WE'RE STILL AN AWARD WINNING AND NATIONALLY CREDITED AGENCY. ADDITIONALLY OF THE EIGHTEEN MILLION THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND EACH YEAR OF FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THAT HOUSE TO COME FROM EARNED REVENUE. OUR PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT ONLY COVERS THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR OPERATIONS SO THE REST HAS TO BE EARNED THROUGH USER FEES. AND THROUGH GRANTS AND SPONSORSHIPS SO WE REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS ON BEING EFFICIENT AND KEEPING OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD VERY LOW. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD GRANT OUR GENERAL MANAGER THE AUTHORITY TO. DO NO BID PROCUREMENT OF UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH WOULD DOUBLE IT FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. WE DO A LOT OF SPECIALIZED PROCUREMENTS WHERE WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PUBLIC VETTING PROCESS AND WE GENERALLY END UP WITH MAYBE ONE VENDOR BECAUSE DESPITE SERVICES ARE SO SPECIALIZED. SO THE EXTRA MINISTRY OF COST TO DO THAT PROCESS IS MONEY THAT WE COULD MUCH BETTER SPENT ELSEWHERE IN OUR PARKS AND IN OUR PROGRAMS FOR THE PUBLIC. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO I'M RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR YOUR AYE VOTES AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO SENATOR. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES FOR. SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE AND OF SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THE MADAM CHAIR.
