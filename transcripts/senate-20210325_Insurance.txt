ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT AB THIRTY TWO MEANWHILE MEN AND WOMEN ARE STILL DETAINED IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS DETAILING THOSE CONDITIONS AND ABUSIVE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT. FINDING THAT THE ADELANTO DETENTION FACILITY FAILED TO MEET MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN STANDARDS AND OPERATORS DID NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS DESPITE REPEATED WARNINGS IT WAS ANOTHER REPORT IN USA TODAY OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS ANOTHER AND THEN ANOTHER USC STUDY.
