00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:40.176
UNDER FUNDED BY ONE POINT EIGHT

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:41.477
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:43.046
AND THAT'S PROBABLY A LOW BALL

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:44.047
ESTIMATE.

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:46.215
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RESOURCES

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.583
THAT HAVE BEEN EXPENDED ON

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:50.320
BEHALF OF THE ID POPULATION?

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:51.387
THESE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:52.689
THAT SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:54.590
REINVESTED.

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:56.826
IN THIS POPULATION.

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:59.195
WE LOOK AT HOW WE'VE UNDERFUNDED.

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.530
FOR DECADES.

01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:02.031
THIS UNDERSERVED AND UNDER

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.199
FUNDED THE POPULATION GOING

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.801
FORWARD.

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.002
THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:07.403
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS WITH THE

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.638
DEMISE OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:09.539

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:13.042
IS IT'S CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:14.777
FOR INCLUSION IN THE COMMUNITIES

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.179
FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT AT

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.548
WHAT COST.

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:19.716
THESE ONE TIME BECAUSE SHOULD BE

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.250
ABSORBED.

THAT THERE'S NO.

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:29.926
FUNNY BUSINESS WITH THE MONEY

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.761
BEING SLID INTO THE GENERAL FUND

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.463

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:39.102

ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.855
