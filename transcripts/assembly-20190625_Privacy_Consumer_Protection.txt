SB SIX FORTY EIGHT REQUIRES DRONE OPERATORS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT THAT RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO MEDIATE LEE LANDED PRONE AT THE NEAREST LOCATION TO PROVIDE THEIR NAME. ADDRESS EMAIL ADDRESS AND VALID ID TO THE INJURED INDIVIDUAL OR THE OWNER OF THE DAMAGE PROPERTY. THE FAA PROJECTS THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE OF RECREATIONAL DRUGS FROM AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT ONE MILLION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWO POINT FOUR MILLION BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO DESPITE THE NUMEROUS PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS FOR DRONES THERE A PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS AS MORE DRONES ENTERED THE PUBLIC AIRSPACE. DRONES OR UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS YOU ASK CAN INVADE PERSONAL SPACE AND CAUSE PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. AND THE STORY I KNOW MISTER CHAIR IS A VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS BUT IN OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTEEN A DRONE CRASHED INTO ELECTRICAL WIRES IN WEST HOLLYWOOD. KNOCKING ONE OF THEM TO THE GROUND THE DOWNED WIRE CUT OFF POWER FOR NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON CUSTOMERS FOR THREE HOURS. AND WITHIN MY DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF CHINO HILLS STANDS THAT BAPS SHRI SWAMINARAYAN -- MUNDHIR IN INTRICATE TO TRADITIONALLY DESIGN HINDU TEMPLE THAT HAS BECOME AN ARCHITECTURAL AND CULTURAL LANDMARK IN THE AREA. UNFORTUNATELY LEADERS WITHIN THE MANDIR HAVE. HAVE NOTIFIED ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF IRRESPONSIBLE DRONE OPERATORS WHO CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE. AND EVERY INCIDENT THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE CONSISTED THE DRONE OPERATOR. TO MANY THEIR EQUIPMENT BACK AND NOT LEAVING INFORMATION TO ACCEPT FALL. UNDER CURRENT LAW MOTOR VEHICLE DRIVERS ARE REQUIRED TO STOP AND PROVIDE ID AND CONTACT INFO IF THEY ARE INVOLVED IN A CAR ACCIDENT THAT CAUSES INJURY IN OUR PROPERTY DAMAGE.

FOREMAN -- SWAMINARAYAN US SONS OF REPRESENTING THE CHINO HILLS BE A P. S.. P. A. P. S. TREES WOMAN ARE AND MAN DEAR. THANKS VERY MUCH FIRST WHEN AS PLEASE WELCOME. HELLO -- I'M GOT THEM TO TELL AND I'M REPRESENTING A SENATOR MENTIONED AT BAPS WHICH IS -- TO A HINDU DENOMINATION OF US -- ONE SUNSTEIN CHINO HILLS -- SO WE'RE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR SENATOR SENATORS HANGS BILL SB -- SIX FOUR EIGHT OUR TEMPLATE YOU KNOW HILLS WHICH IS TRADITIONAL IN BOTH DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE HAS HAD MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY RESPONSIBLE OPERATION OF THERE MUST BE RESPONSIBLE JOHN OPERATORS. HAVE DAMAGE OUR PROPERTY IN SYDNEY SIGNIFICANT WAYS -- OUR TEMP OUR TEMPLE FEATURES THOUSANDS OF INTRICATE CARVINGS BOTH ON THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE AND THAT MAKES IT A POPULAR LANDMARK FOR JOHN OPERATORS -- DESPITE SIGNS PROHIBITING JONES ON THE PROPERTY WE'VE HAD COUNTLESS OCCASIONS IN WHICH THE OPERATORS FLY FROM ADJACENT LOTS OF FROM ACROSS THE STREET -- WITHOUT GOOD VISIBILITY AND THEY TRY TO FLY THEIR DRONES AND THEY'VE HIT -- THEY'VE DAMAGE OUR PROPERTY OUR TEMPLE SPIRES ARE PILLARS OUR WATER FEATURES AND MANY OTHER ASKED -- PARTS OF OUR BUILDING IN EACH OF THESE SITUATIONS WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY RECOURSE AND THE DRONE OPERATORS IMMEDIATELY. DEMAND THEY'RE DRAWN BACK AND OCCASIONALLY THEY HAVE A THREATEN TO CALL THE COPS IF WE WERE UNABLE -- TO SO IT NOT ONLY ARE THEY DAMAGING OUR PROPERTY BUT THEY'RE ALSO THREATENING US AND IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT OCCASIONALLY FOR US TO GET THE DRONES FROM SOME OF THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH THEY'RE CRASHING THEM -- AND THAT OUR TEMPLE WHICH HAS -- THE INTRICATE CARVINGS ON THE DAMAGE THAT'S DONE TO THEM IS ACTUALLY -- IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO FIX BECAUSE THEIR THE TRADITIONAL HINDU MIND THERE IS -- THE CARVINGS ARE DONE BY ARTISANS AND SOME OF THE STONE AGE MOST OF THE SUN IS ACTUALLY SHIP FROM INDIA SO. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD JUST FIX REALLY EASILY THE DAMAGES REALLY REALLY SIGNIFICANT -- AND AGAIN IN EACH SITUATION AT THE JOHN OPERATORS THAT THERE'S NO RECOURSE AND THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT COOPERATIVE AT ALL WITH US -- AND WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT THIS SO AGAIN WE DON'T ALLOW THIS ON OUR PROPERTY BUT WE CAN'T STOP THEM FROM -- FLYING STARTING THEIR JONES FROM OUTSIDE OF THE PROPERTY IN FLYING -- ON TO OURS SO. WE WE'VE JUST -- WE'VE SPOKEN WITH CENTER CHAINS OFFICE AND THEIR OF THEIR AND REALLY NO SOLUTIONS AND AGAIN. WHILE WE WOULD PREFER TO HAVE OBVIOUSLY NO JONES BE ABLE TO OPERATE ON NEAR THE TEMPLE I THINK THAT THIS IS A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY AND IT PROVIDES US TO HAVE OUR FIRST STEP IN TOWARDS. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF RECOURSE. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BEFORE WE GO TO OUR NEXT WITNESS CAN WE ESTABLISH QUORUM -- FOR THE MEETING PLEASE MA'AM SECRETARY CHAO HERE [inaudible] KILEY.

AND DJ I AS WELL AS OTHERS AS MEMBERS. AND WE HAD OPPOSE LESS AMENDED POSITION BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL NOW THAT THE AUTHORS ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS REFLECTED ME ANALYSIS FOR PART ONE OF SEVEN EXEMPTION -- WE APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS PAST WORK ON THIS ISSUE COMMITTEE STAFF AND DRIVE FOR THE BILL. THANKS VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL ON WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE STEP FORWARD. SCENE NINE OPPOSITION. LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO COME ON UP BY A I DON'T SEE ANY. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- APPRECIATE THE OTHER BRING THIS FORWARD I THINK IT ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE SO THE AMENDMENTS ARE GONNA EXEMPT ANYONE OPERATING UNDER. F. A. R.. ONE OH SEVEN SO I'M WONDERING -- WHO? WHAT OPERATOR WITH THIS APPLY TO ANOTHER WAS WHAT WHAT CLASS OF OPERATORS THERE THAT IS NOT OPERATING UNDER IF WE ARE ONE OF? SEVEN YEAH THE AMATEUR -- DRONE OPERATORS THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO OPERATE UNDER ONE OH SEVEN NO [inaudible] YEAH. SO YOU HAVE TO FOR FAA ONE OH SEVEN YOU HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS LIKE TRAINING. ON AND I'VE ACTUALLY -- I'VE ACTUALLY -- ATTENDED A CLASS AT FULLER ST COLLEGE WHERE THEY ARE TRAINING A DRONE OPERATORS AND IN ORDER TO GET THAT YOU NEED -- TO IN ORDER TO BE CERTIFIED YOU HAVE -- TO GO THROUGH IN A CLASS AND THEN. APPLY FOR THE FAA -- CERTIFICATION RIGHT AND FOR UNDER ONE ONE SEVEN OPERATORS IF THEY HAVE AN ACCIDENT THERE WOULD HAVE -- TO NOTIFY TO THE FAA WAS OUR UNDERSTAND ACCIDENTALLY BUT I HAD THOUGHT I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON ONE OF SEVEN I'M AN EXPERT ON NINETY ONE AND ONE THIRTY FIVE AND I WANT -- TO SEVEN I HAD THOUGHT THAT BECAUSE OF JUST READING FROM ONE OH SEVEN DOT TWELVE IT SAYS. NO PERSON MAY MANIPULATE THE FLIGHT CONTROLS OF A SMALL. UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM UNLESS AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE THING OF OF OF CATEGORIES SO I THOUGHT THAT EVEN RECREATIONAL. DRONE OPERATORS HAD TO COMPLY WITH ONE OF SEVEN BECAUSE ONE OF SEVEN IS WHERE IT SAYS YOU HAVE TO REGISTER GROWN YOU HAVE TO GET A DRONE OPERATOR'S LICENSE. AND SO THAT LEFT ME WONDERING YOU KNOW IF WE'RE EXEMPTING ALL OF ONE OF SEVEN PEOPLE OPERATING UNDER WATER SEVEN WHO. WHO'S LEFT. SO AGAINST MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- MOST COMMERCIAL OPERATORS ARE PART ONE OF SEVEN AND THEN SOME RECREATIONAL CAN CHOOSE TO GO THROUGH THE FULL PART ONE OF SEVEN PROCESS BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE THOSE RECREATIONAL OPERATORS WHO AREN'T. PART WHEN A SEVEN TO PROBABLY THE FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THE DAMAGE AT THE TEMPLE HER JUST OKAY WELL WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO JUDICIARY ACTS AS A RIGHT. AFTER THIS. WITH THIS BILL. IT'S GOING TO TRANSPORTATION. FLOOR BUT ALTHOUGH DELIVER MORE RESEARCH ON THAT IF I COULD OFFER ONE SUGGESTION -- IT WOULD BE THAT YOU DEFINE DAMAGE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY SO YOU'RE REQUIRED TO TO FILE REPORTER OR LEADER IDENTIFICATION IF YOU'RE GROWN CAUSES DAMAGE. BUT TO TO JUST USE A RIDICULOUS EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE FLYING A DRONE AND YOU RUN OUT OF BATTERY AND IT COMES DOWN IN SOMEONE'S YARD INTO BANDS A SINGLE BLADE OF GRASS I MEAN I'M I'M I'M BEING RIDICULOUS HERE BUT I MEAN THAT IS MATERIALLY DAMAGE RIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WERE INTENDING -- TO SAY THAT THAT'S AN ACCIDENT A REQUIRE YOU TO LEAVE NOTICE FOR SO -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ADOPT THE SAME TEST THAT IF WE ARE ONE OH SEVEN ADOPTION SAY THAT THERE'S A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR THRESHOLD. YOU KNOW ABOVE WHICH THAT'S CONSIDERED DAMAGE AND BELOW WHICH IT'S NOT. YEAH. THAT'S SOMETHING DEFINITELY I'LL LOOK INTO OKAY. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE OF YOU MAY CLOSE. WITH THAT I'LL JUST. ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

DENNIS WELCOME CENTER HERTZBERG ARE YOU. READING IS GERMAN YES I'M READY I'M READY. TO OKAY READY LET'S PROCEED. THIS IS THE TICKET SCALPER BUSINESS TRUTH AND TICKET SCALPING. WHAT HAPPENS IS A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE ARE A? TAKEN UP NAMES OF ROCK GROUPS -- SPORTS GROUPS OR WHATEVER PUT THEM ON THE WEBSITE. AND THERE THE THE THE AVERAGE CONSUMER THINKS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BUYING A TICKET FROM THAT ORGANIZATION AND THEY'RE REALLY SCALPERS. AND SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS OF THIS BILL WE GET DETAILS IS BASICALLY. MAKE GET GIVEN A REMEDY AND STOP IN THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE ENGAGING PHONY BALONEY BUSINESS -- AND THEY'RE THEY'RE RIPPING OFF THE SYSTEM AND THEY'RE USING DECEPTIVE PRACTICES TO DO SO -- THIS MODERN TECHNOLOGY OF THE INTERNET THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GIVEN IN THE REMEDY. AND UNLIKE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE WE'VE FACED HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN PRIVACY ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THIS IS -- INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS FOR FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR THE NATURE OF THE OF OF THE THE HARM AGAINST THE REMEDY. AND SO CLEARLY THAT IS EXACTLY WE'RE GOING AFTER AND WITH THAT OUTSIDE OF MY WITNESSES AND AS FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIRST WIN AS PLEASE. GAVIN CHAIRMAN CHAO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIAN HESS I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SPORTS FANS COALITION WHICH IS THE NATION'S LEADING FAN ADVOCACY GROUP. TODAY I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. THIRTY THREE FORTY TWO FOR THE LAST DECADE SPORTS FANS COALITION IS FOUGHT FOR FANS WE TACKLE ISSUE TO TO THE PUBLIC FINANCING A SPORTS STADIUM SPORTS BETTING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. MEDIA ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME FANS JP GENDER PAY EQUITY IN SUPPORT AND TICKET FRAUD. PASSING AS THREE FORTY TWO IN A RICH SPORTS CULTURALLY CALIFORNIANS WILL BE A MASSIVE BLOW TO THE FRAUDSTERS YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FANS ESPECIALLY LESS TECH SAVVY FANS. BY USING MISLEADING MARKETING TACTICS WHAT LABEL TICKET SITE TO SEE FANS THAT THINK THEY'RE BUYING DIRECTLY FROM VENUE BOX OFFICE AT FACE VALUE BUT IN REALITY ARE BUYING FROM A THIRD PARTY. PRETENDING TO BE THAT OFFICIAL SITE. I AM HERE ADVOCATING TO PROTECT SPORTS FANS THIS FRAUD IMPACTS ALL FANS OF LIVE EVENTS INCLUDING CONCERTS AND THEATRE. LABEL FRAUD WORKS LIKE THIS CONSUMERS WILL USE GOOGLE OR ANOTHER SEARCH ENGINE FOR TICKETS TO AN INVENTOR VENUE. AND MANY SITES WILL BE DISPLAYED -- BUT DESPITE NOT BEING LICENSED OR OFFICIAL BOB MANY OF THE SITES WE USE WORDS OFFICIAL OR BOX OFFICE IN RELATION TO THE VENUE. AND UNDER THE BELIEF THE CONSUMER IS ON THE REAL SICK AT SITE THEY WILL PURCHASE A TICKET. AFTER COMPLETING SEVERAL STEPS IN THE CHECKOUT PROCESS THIS CONSUMER IS HIT WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL FEES WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE THE COST. IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SPORTS RIMS COALITION BEGAN INVESTIGATING THIS PRACTICE WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS FAR MORE RAMPANT FRAUD WE HAD INITIALLY BELIEVED. EVERY RECENTLY REPLICATED THE STUDY AND DESPITE MANY ATTEMPTS BY INDUSTRY THE DECEPTIVE WEBSITES CONTINUE TO PLAGUE SEARCH ENGINES. THE DANGERS OF THIS PRACTICE GO WELL BEYOND JUST FOOLING FANS AND THE CLICKING ON THEIR SITE THERE ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE RESELLERS WHO USE VIVID SEATS OR TICKET NETWORKS WHITE LABEL PLATFORMS FOR THE DECEMBER SIXTEEN RAM VERSUS EAGLES GAME LAST SEASON. TO SEE FANS IN THE PURCHASING TICKETS FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE THAN FACE VALUE. IN SOME CASES BY CHARGING SERVICE FEES EQUAL TO ONE THIRD THE DISPLAYED PRICE. SPORTS FANS COALITION BELIEVES THE USE DECEPTIVE U. R. L. SHOULD BE BANNED. ON THE CUSP OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY NINETEEN FOOTBALL SEASON WITH THE RAMS TAKE IT BECOMING A HOT COMMODITY AFTER THEIR AMAZING SEVERAL RUN LAST YEAR. AND THE RAIDERS PLAYING WHAT MAYBE THEIR FINAL SEASON IN OAKLAND THE POTENTIAL FOR WHITE LABEL FRAUD IS GREATER THAN EVER. AS SUCH SPORTSMAN COALITION BECAUSE IN THE SENATORS -- SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY TWO AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S FANS FROM BEING DECEIVED THANK YOU. THANKS MUCH -- ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LOVE REPRESENTING EBAY SUB POP ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MUCH NO NEXT PLEASE. MARK PRAYER ON BEHALF OF AJ OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF STAPLES CENTER AND MULTIPLE OTHER VENUES WE ARE DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. JOE RIGHT OUT WITH CONSUMER ACTION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MATCHA OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. CENA AND UP BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MR OBERNOLTE HAVE QUESTION COMMON. CENTER VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE -- HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU THE OUR FRAUDULENT PRACTICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING -- BEING EXPERIENCED IN THIS DOMAIN. WOULDN'T SOMEONE ALREADY BE ABLE -- TO TO SEE ONE OF THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW THE FALSE ADVERTISING LAW TO PUT A STOP TO THESE TO THIS. THEY WERE GIVEN A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED IS THE IS THE ACTION OF THE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS GOD. YES CERTAINLY THEY WOULD BUT I THINK THAT JUST LIKE COM WHAT WE DO WITH RANSOMWARE WE'VE DONE IN THE COLD IS. TOO YOU KNOW AS THE LAW CHANGES OVER THE YEARS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED IS TO MODERNIZE YOU KNOW WE DID WHAT SIGNATURES TO ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A COLD THIS MORE RESPONSIVE. AND ALSO TO CREATE THE THE DEPARTMENT OF ACTION IT QUITE FRANKLY AND THEN INCLUDING GET INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ALREADY UNDER EVENTEEN TO WATER AND KNOW THAT THAN SOME OF THOSE CASES IN MY DAY. BUT SO THAT WAS THE THAT'S THE UNDERLYING THINKING BEHIND A BEHIND THIS LEGISLATION OKAY SO WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY WAS THAT YES SOMEONE COULD BRING SUIT. BUT THERE'S NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION UNDER THOSE STATUTES AND THAT'S WHY THIS THIS ACCOMPLISHES SOMETHING MORE. RIGHT OKAY AND YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR IT IT IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER STATES HAVE BIG. ABOUT SPORTS PERSON BUT I AM TOLD THAT SO I CAN ABOUT A BIG SPORTS BETTING NEW YORK NEW JERSEY OTHER STATES THEY'VE DONE THIS KINDA LAW. AND WE'RE TRYING TO CUT HARMONIZES AROUND THE STATUS CALIFORNIA LOVES TO BE THE LEADER AND EVERYTHING THIS IS ONE WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY -- TAKING THESE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT POSITIONS IN THIS AREA AND TRY TO FOLLOW IT AND CONFORM LAW OKAY. AND CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHY PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONE PART OF THE BILL TO GIVE ME A LITTLE PAUSE YEAH I'D LIKE. TO YEAH IT WAS IT GAVE ME SOME PAUSE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I WANTED TO DO IS THIS -- EVEN THOUGH BECAUSE I WE HAD THIS ON PRIVACY HERE AT THIS COMMITTEE HAD TO DEAL WITH. AS SOME OF US NOW. AND SO BUT IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR RIGHT. PRIVATE ACTION OTHER INSTANCES ARE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS WE WILL BE SEEN BEFORE LIKE IN THE PARKING SPACES WERE SOMEBODY AND PAINT THE THING EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY. AND WHETHER THEY WOULD BE HELD LIABLE AND THE IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE THIS STUFF WHEN WHICH YOU JUST HEARD THE TESTIMONY. I'M OUT THERE REPRESENTING THAT THIS IS AN OFFICIAL NFL WHATEVER THIS TEAM OR WHATEVER TEAM DODGERS TEAM AND YOU COULD BUY YOUR TICKETS HERE. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE DIRECT. INTENTIONAL ACT TO DEFRAUD PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET TO ME LEVEL OF CULPABILITY IF YOU LOOK AT OUR JURISPRUDENTIAL HISTORY INFORMS CONSEQUENCES SO I'M WILLING TO GO THERE BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THE ACT BY ITS VERY -- BUT INFORMED ON ITS FACE IS FRAUDULENT. THAT TO ME IS WHAT MAKES THE DISTINCTION THAT'S WHY I WENT THERE BECAUSE I'M YOU KNOW HESITANT WE HAVE DONE THIS VERY OFTEN THE LAST. TWENTY FIVE THIRTY YEARS AND I I BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE ACT IT'S THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE RIGHT THANK YOU. SURE. pDO YOU THINK THAT I WANT TO MENTION IS ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL UPS THE ANTE OF FOR EXAMPLE EXISTING LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. OR ALL CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR IS AS I'M NOT A CORRECT. SO. SO THE THE ON THE GO YOU KNOW I HAVE A QUESTION YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER BUT UP. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ASSIGNMENT OF THESE DOMAIN NAMES ARE YOU ARE ELVES? DO YOU KNOW HOW. SEVERE THE PROBLEM IS IN THAT YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE DOMAINS ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE ELVES HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO LET'S SEE COMPANIES THAT REALLY DO NOT. HAVE NO LEGITIMATE RIGHT CITIES DOMAINS WE ARE EL IF YOU HAVE IF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER I CAN ANSWER THAT -- SO THERE'S THERE'S REALLY ONLY TWO MAJOR NETWORK COMP FORM COMPANIES THAT FACILITATE IS WHITE LABELS IS TAKING OUR CAN VIVID -- TAKEN HOURS CURRENTLY UNDER A CONSENT DECREE WITH THE DOJ FOR THIS VERY BEHAVIOR -- THEY ALLOW INDIVIDUAL RESELLERS LIKE ANYONE IN THIS ROOM CAN GO AND CREATE A U. R. L. ONCE THEY BY THE DOMAIN NAME. AND THEN USE THE BACK AND TECHNOLOGY THE PLATFORM ABOVE AND TO TAKE AN HOUR TO ACTUALLY SELL. USE THAT WAY NO ONE HAS TO BE A YOU KNOW A CODER THINK OF IF YOU'RE BUILDING A WEBSITE ON SQUARE SPACE. YEAH YOU DON'T HAVE TO CO THE WEBSITE USED. PAULA PLATFORM UP -- BUT SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS A BY THESE THIS UP TO YOU NO MEANS GIVEN TAKE NOW WE DON'T REALLY. REVIEW THOSE AT ALL OR THEY THEY SOMETIMES WILL CLAIM LIKE THEY HAVE COMMUNITY STANDARDS BUT WE DON'T SEE ANY ENFORCEMENT SO IT'S IN THE STUDY I REFERENCE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WHEN I GOOGLED WRIGLEY FIELD TICKETS. WE CAME BACK WITH FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE TOP -- PAID SEARCH RESULTS. ADS WERE RIGHT LABEL SITES THAT SAID THINGS LIKE RIDLEY TICKET STOP BOX OFFICE DOT COM -- BEYOND THAT WHEN WE WENT DOWN TO THE ORGANIC RESULTS FIVE OF THE TOP FIVE ON THE FIRST PAGE OF GOOGLE WERE THESE WHITE LABEL COMPANIES. PRETENDING AND YOU HAD TO GO TO THE VERY BOTTOM ACTUALLY FIND. RIDLEY TICKETS NOW GOOGLE HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS SPACE. TO CUT CARVE THIS BEHAVIOR -- OTHER SEARCH ENGINES HAVE NOT -- AND SO YOU YOU GET VARYING RESULTS DEPENDING ON WHICH SEARCH ENGINE YOU PREFER GOT IT. MISS KILEY GUY. SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD STEP I'M I'M WONDERING. YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN PEOPLE REALLY LOOK AT THE AT THE ACTUAL YOU ARE OUT WHEN THEY CLICK ON A SEARCHES HONOR THESE COMPANIES USING OTHER. TACTICS LIKE PARROTING THE APPEARANCE OF THE OFFICIAL SITE AND YEAH IT WAS A WAY WE CAN GET A THAT CONDUCT YEAH SO THE TITLE OF THE WEB PAGE THE THING THAT MOST PEOPLE YOU KNOW READ BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T READ THE U. R. L. OF EVERY YOUR SEARCH ENGINE RESULTS. THE TOP HEADLINE IS OFTEN TIMES JUST. SACRAMENTO KINGS TICKETS. TWENTY OF TWENTY NINETEEN SEASON -- OR THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE IT'S YOU JUST CLICK IT AND YOU DON'T THINK ESPECIALLY IF. YOU -- YOUR VISIONS A PAIR YOU CAN'T READ THE SMALL PRINT IN THE U. R. L. YOU CAN'T TELL THE TO ADD OR NOT -- WE'VE SEEN THESE KINDS OF THINGS HEART OFFICIALLY -- OLDER FOR OLDER FANS LIKE PEOPLE TRYING TO BUY TICKETS -- FOR THEIR GRANDKIDS AS GIFTS. THEY'LL USE THOUGH YOU JUST LIKE SACRAMENTO KINGS TICKETS IN THE TOP. BUT THAT THIS BILL WOULDN'T STOP THEM FROM DOING THAT -- WHAT IT YEAH BECAUSE THEY WILL BE STILL USING OFFICIAL -- AND THAT WOULDN'T BE IN THE U. R. L. SO THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE COVERED BY THE BILL RIGHT. I HAVE THE DIFF -- FOR THE SENATE BECAUSE THOSE REMAINS WITH THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHAT SO HE WAS GIVEN AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE -- YOU KNOW MAYBE ON THAT WEB PAGE ITSELF THE KIND OF MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S THE OFFICIAL -- DISTRIBUTOR -- BAD YOU KNOW AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT'S MORE LIKELY TO CATCH SOMEONE'S EYE AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT THAT THE OR ELSE IT IS THE BILL PROVIDE A WAY TO YEAH TALK RIGHT NOW THAT MONEY TO TALKS ABOUT THE CREATING DECEPTIVE PRACTICES IN TERMS OF LIKE IF YOU WANT. TO GO FOR THE DAY. SORRY FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO THE DODGERS FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible] THE DODGERS. MR GABRIEL THE DODGERS THANK YOU. AND SO YOU KNOW THEY'LL HAVE IT LOOK IT WILL JUST SAY IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT LOOK LIKE IT'S A DODGER SITE IT'S DECEPTIVE THE IDEA WHEN YOU READ THE BILL. TALKS ABOUT DECEPTIVE TO BE ABLE TO MISINFORM THE VIEWER THAT THIS IS IN THE FACT THAT THE AIR FASHION OFFICIAL UNOFFICIAL SITE SO IT'S DEEPER THAN JUST THE U. R. L. IT'S ACTUALLY THE LARGER DECEPTIVE PRACTICES IN ORDER TO TRY. TO BASICALLY FOR A JEEP PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BUYING TICKETS FROM THE DOCTORS. ONE AND IT TALKS ABOUT USING THEIR TRADEMARKS TO A TRADEMARK OR NAME SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR I'M READING FROM PAGE THREE OF THE MEASURE. TO THOSE REFERRED TO IN THE SUBDIVISION INCLUDING THAT LIMIT TO MISSPELLING OF A TRADE MARK OR TRADE NAME REFERRED TO ON IF YOU SEEN THIS BEFORE BUT SOMEONE LIKE TAKE A LETTER OUT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE. SOMETHING IN THIS SPELL IT IN ORDER TO GET A DIFFERENT NAME BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE QUICKLY LOOKING AT IT EXACTLY THE TRADE NAME YOU'RE LOOKING AFTER AND YOU MARRY THAT WITH THE RIGHT COLORS IN THE TRADE WHEN THEY THAT YOU DID THE LOGO'S AND STUFF. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE DECEIVING PEOPLE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GETTING TO THE I THINK WEARING THOSE IT ONLY APPLIES IF IT'S IN THE U. R. L. ITSELF RIGHT [inaudible] RIGHT. I THINK THAT THAT ONLY APPLIES THE WAY I'M READING THE LANGUAGE OF ITS IN THE U. R. L. ITSELF WHAT [inaudible] YEAH. THAT'S HOW THEY DO THAT'S HOW THEY GET YEAH. I'VE HAD OVER YOU'VE HAD IT HAPPENED MAYBE HAVING YOUR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS WHERE PEOPLE MAKE ONE DIFFERENT AND LETTER AND STUFF IN THE BIG CRATE FOR WEBSITES I'VE HAD IT HAPPEN TO ME AND NUMBER OF ELECTIONS OFFICES IS APPLIED ELECTIONS. BUT YOU SEE ALL THE TIME OR LAW OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO GET YOU TO CLICK ON THINGS. TO YOUR CREDIT CARD COMPANIES WHATEVER THEY'LL DO THIS TO THE END OF A IMPLANT A A BUGGY I MEAN THAT BUT WHAT THEY CALL A VIRUS IN YOUR SYSTEM. THAT REALLY IS THE WAY THAT THEY GET TO YOU. YEAH I THINK IT'S AS WELL I'M HAPPY VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORTED -- BUT DIED THE IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE'S STILL GONNA BE SOME WAYS AROUND IT SO IT'S A IT'S A GOOD QUESTION IS ALSO -- SOME OTHER WORKING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE BOSS ACT THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSING -- EVEN DEEPER THAN JUST YOUR HOUSE BUT BROADLY USING THE WITH THE WEBSITE ITSELF.

REALLY PROBLEMATIC AND REALLY THE KEY THING ABOUT THIS BILL THAT SETS A TIME CERTAIN -- WHEN THE INDUSTRY MUST ADOPT AND AND -- UTILIZE A SOFTWARE THERE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT IS IN PLACE THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. OF THE INDUSTRY'S ALREADY WORKING ON THIS THEY ARE -- PRIME -- TO IMPLEMENT AND UTILIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FEDS -- THIS JUST GIVES A TIME CERTAIN AND SOME COMFORT IN CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE THE CALIFORNIA THAT IT WILL BE USED AND WE KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE USED.

SO THAT IS NOT PROBLEMATIC FOR US -- WE HAVE A VERY SMALL LITTLE ISSUE HERE WITH THE PROPOSAL -- THE BILL CALLS OUT SECTION TWO TWO SEVEN OF TITLE FORTY SEVEN OF THE FEDERAL STATUTES AND IN THAT CODE SECTION THAT'S THE CODE SECTION THAT GIVES THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE. ALL THE MISUSE OF COMMUNICATION DEVICES SO RUBBLE CALLS BEING ONE OF THEM -- THAT STATUE ALSO IN THE ANNOUNCES APPROPRIATE CALLS OUT THAT THEY CAN THE STATE'S CAN ALSO DESIGNATE AN ADDITIONAL STATE AGENCY TO HELP IN THAT ENFORCEMENT THIS BILL CALLS OUT THE P. YOU SEE. OUR CONCERNS WITH THAT PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT GRANT ANY NEW ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO THE PC IN A REGULATORY FASHION -- WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THAT -- BUT IF THE PROPOSAL THAT THE LANGUAGE IS VERY BROAD IN THIS AND THERE'S NO BUMPERS AROUND IT SO WHAT WE SEE IS SORT OF REPERTORY TREAT. AND THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR MAIN CONCERN -- BUT TO THE ISSUE OF RUBBLE COSTS WITH THIS THAT I WE STIPULATE EVERYTHING THE SENATOR SAID THEY ARE THE WORST OFFENDERS OUT THERE AND JUST TODAY THE FTC ON OUR WEBSITE ANNOUNCED I WISH HAD THIS INFORMATION YESTERDAY TO SHARE WITH EVERYONE.

WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IF WE COULD PUT SOME BUMPERS AROUND THAT TO CLARIFY THAT THEIR ROLE IS PURELY -- AS AN EXPERT IN. IN ENFORCING UP CIVIL CASES AT THE FEDERAL COURT BECAUSE OF SECTION TWO TWO SEVEN IS AN ENFORCEMENT PROVISION NOT AGAINST COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS BUT AGAINST REBEL CALLERS -- AND THAT LANGUAGE -- WOULD -- HELP IF YOU COULD IF THE PC WAS TO HELP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROSECUTE CASES THE FEDERAL COURT WE WILL BE SUPPORT OF THAT SO WITH THAT -- WAS NICE BUT I WANT TO TAKE THE CENTER TO WE'VE MADE WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WE'VE HAD. VERY GOOD DISCUSSIONS -- CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- WITH US ON THIS I THINK WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO SOME RESOLUTION BUT AT THE MOMENT THE BILL IN PRINT WE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MR AND MEMBERS -- JONATHAN HERE WILL BE HALF OF C. T. I. AID THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. WE ALSO -- MUST OPPOSE SB TO AWAIT THE THE FOUR NATIONAL WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE ACTUALLY ON TRACK TO IMPLEMENT -- STIR SHAKE IN OUR PROGRAM TO COMBAT UNWANTED WROBEL CALLS BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE FCC ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT STEPS -- TO COMBAT UNWANTED REBEL BECAUSE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW THE CPC IS NOT EQUIPPED TO ENFORCE. LAWS DEALING WITH ROBO CALLS WE THINK IT'S JUST THE WRONG AGENCY BY INVOLVING THE C. P. U. C.. WE ACTUALLY THINK SB TWO AWAY COULD DIVERT ATTENTION AND FOCUS FROM IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS AND ADD A LAYER OF REGULATION THAT IS. YOU KNOW OFTEN DON'T SEE PC TIME CONSUMING LENGTHY AND WE THINK IN THIS CASE JUST UNNECESSARY -- IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE FCC ON JUNE SIX THEY ADOPTED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING THAT PROPOSES A MANDATE TO IMPLEMENT THE SHAKEN STIR. IF MAJOR VOICE SERVICE WRITERS FAILED TO DO SO SO BY THE END OF THIS YEAR -- AND YOU BECAUSE THIS TO CREATE A PASSWORD OR STATE LAWS INVOLVED IN CEBU SEEING COMPLICATE THINGS -- THE OF SEE IS ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE -- AND SO WE YOU KNOW STILL MUST OPPOSE SB. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OPPOSITIONAL OPPOSITION PLEASE COMPORT. YOUR NAME IN ORGANIZATION PLACE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DOMINICK TOMORROW HERE ON BEHALF OF FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS. FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED OPPOSED THANK YOU MUCH. LET'S BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTION MISTER CALDERON GO AHEAD. A CENTER OUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK THERE'S A MEMBER. ARE PICKED INDIVIDUAL THE AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW THE HASN'T RECEIVED A TON OF THESE CALLS I'VE BEEN CALLED. BY MYSELF AND I KNEW I WAS BEING SPOOFED BUT I HAD ANSWERED JUST BECAUSE I WAS CURIOUS. WHAT I SOUNDED LIKE? AND LIKE IT'S OUT OF MY OWN VOICE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU CALL ME AND I GET FILTERS TO BUT I YOU KNOW I IT I HAVE VERIZON AND ACTUAL WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD AN APP I KNOW EIGHTEEN T. HAS IT AS WELL -- WHERE EVERY TIME IT'S ONE OF THESE IT'S NOT EVERY TIME BUT? IT'S PRETTY GOOD A PICK AND PICKING UP THE SPOOFING CALLS AND SO IT'LL SAY POTENTIAL SPAM -- ON MY AB WHILE I'M CALLING AND I JUST KIND OF DECLINE THE CALL IT HAS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL FOR ME TO BE ABLE. TO KIND OF WE THESE CALLS OUT -- BUT AGAIN ALL TIME -- YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND. WHERE THEY OPPOSITION COMING FROM IN TERMS OF CPU CME? THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY OUR HOUSES AND A LOT OF ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO THE CPUC -- BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH I MEAN MY ONLY CONCERN WOULD JUST BE MAKING SURE THAT. WE DO CC ROBO CALLS WELL MAYBE NOT AS MUCH ANYMORE BUT WE HAVE DONE I HAVE -- FIFTY FAMILY FRIEND THAT HAS YOU KNOW DOES REBEL CALLS AND YOU KNOW MAKES A MAKES A BUSINESS OUT OF IT SO I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE THE PROPER PROTECTIONS IN THERE FOR LEGITIMATE. BUSINESS PRACTICES YOU KNOW THAT THOSE CALLS THAT AREN'T JUST DISPROVING CALLS MEANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU -- AT THAT WERE CAPTURING THOSE AND NOT ACTUALLY TEARING DOWN LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES WHERE PEOPLE ARE MAKING GOOD WAGES AND MADE IT OUT. DOING YOU KNOW SOMETHING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE FIND ACCEPTABLE SUPPOSE THESE SPOOFING CAUSE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT'S A NIGHTMARE IT'S A NUISANCE. WE GET THESE CALLS ALL THE TIME I'M SICK OF IT AND FOR EVERYBODY ELSE IS SICK OF IT BUT WE CAN'T GET THEIR WHETHER HAVING THIS DISCUSSION. I THINK THAT THE STATE SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN AND HOW -- THESE POLICIES -- GUARANTEE IMPLEMENTED NOT JUST IN OUR STATE BUT NATIONWIDE AS WELL SO THANK YOU [inaudible] MR BERMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS ADJOURNED AND CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS BILL I'D I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL HERE AND PROBABLY ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY IT BY SCOOPING CALLS AND JUST THE THE PAIN. THAT THE IN THE IN THE BEHIND THEY CREATE -- COULD YOU SPEAK TO A LITTLE I I ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE CPC AND THEIR ROLE IN THE BILL KEY TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT -- TO YOU KNOW WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO HAVE A BE BOTH AG AND THE CBC -- OR IS THERE SOME ROOM THERE TO MAN MOVEMENT ON THAT ISSUE AND IT THEY THEY MENTION THAT THE BILL IS VERY GENERAL AND THAT EFFORT AND ACTUALLY THIS IS A VERY EXTREMELY NARROW BILL. THE BILL SIMPLY REQUIRESTHEM TO IMPLEMENT. A AUTHENTICATION PROGRAM AND THE NEXT THING. WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAW SO HOW WOULD WE ACTUALLY ENFORCE THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING THROUGH AND IMPLEMENTING. THIS TECHNOLOGY WHO WOULD OVERSEE THAT WHO WOULD. ARE A CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE NUMBER TWO WE WANT TO GO AFTER THE THE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SCAMMING. IF THERE WAS A WAY TO TRACK DOWN WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE IF THERE FOR SOME REASON. LAW ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE -- FINDS THAT -- THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. THERE'S ALSO GOT TO BE A MECHANISM TO ENFORCE THAT PART OF IT SO THE PCS OF EXTREMELY LIMITED ROLE. I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE UC USING THIS BILL TO PRY OPEN OTHER -- YOU KNOW OTHER REGULATORY ACTION THAT WOULD NOT BE -- ALLOWED UNDER THIS BILL. IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE ACTION AS DEFINED BY THE BILL -- I'M. COMFORTABLE WITH WORKING WITH THEM TO THE FURTHER DEFINED THAT OR SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL AND TO THAT REGARD. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED -- TO CONFIRM THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES ARE DOING THIS AND THAT COULD COULD BE THE P. UC'S ROLE AND ALSO TO WORK WITH YOU TENER TOURNEY GENERAL TO COMPILE DATA. GETTING GET DATA TOGETHER DOES NOT -- AND AND IT WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO LOOK IN FOR THE SCAMMERS AND IT WOULD BE SPECIFIC -- TO WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEING PEOPLE -- TO JUSTICE. I DON'T SEE FOR WE LIVE I'VE DISCUSSED THIS WITH THEM AT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE'VE BEEN IN TALKS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW -- THERE THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERNS -- OUT PEOPLE WERE STILL AT THE TABLE. I DON'T WANNA RAISE -- ANY MISTER PROBLEMS FOR THEM BUT WERE REALLY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT. THE PC DOES ITS JOB NOT SURE THEY'RE DOING THAT AND WE GO AND AND THIS PRACTICES STOPPED AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND YOU KNOW PUT IN. BRINGING SOME PEOPLE THAT WHAT'S RESOURCES TO FIND PUT AN END OF THIS IS ME IS WHAT MAY BE REQUIRED IN THIS PROCESS. SO AS I READ IT THE FEDERAL RT GRANTS AUTHORITIES HE PCM I READ ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT JUST THE AG UNDER. TWO TWO SEVEN BUT TO ANY COMMISSION. IN THIS ROOM AS WELL. WELL THAT. IS A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT IS -- YOUR YOU'RE RIGHT AND I COULDN'T. TELL TELL YOU THE LETTER OF THE LAW ON THAT -- BUT UNDER THIS UNDER THIS BILL -- IT REALLY DOESN'T EVEN. GO. THAT ADDITIONAL STEP WE WE DEFINE VERY VERY CLEARLY WHAT THE CPUC ROLE WITHIN IN THIS REGARD IT'S A VERY NARROW. IT ONLY HAS TO DO WITH -- COMPILING DATA TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH THE STATE LAW IT'S VERY NARROW. YEAH I MEAN IT SAYS THAT WHENEVER THE AG OF A STATE OR AN OFFICIAL OR AGENCY DESIGNATED BY THE STATE RIGHTS WE'VE DESIGNATED THIS AGENCY. THAT DOESN'T MEAN SI PC IN THIS ROUND SO I WOULD AND AFTER THAT I JUST YOU. TWO SEVEN THEY HAVE THE STORY AND I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES CONCERNED I THINK THE CPC HAS SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT JOBS TO DO RIGHT NOW -- BUT BUT WITH REGARD TO VOICE -- WHAT VOICE OVER INTERNET? THE THE LEGISLATURE SETS THE POLICY ON ARE THE PC WAS TO GIVE AND TAKE IN THE WAY THAT RESPONSIBLY BUT BY THE BY THE LEGISLATURE WITH. WITH VOICE RULES. AND AND SO THE NEW RULE IS LEGISLATURE'S THAT SETS THE POLICY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AN ATTEMPT TO SET THE POLICY AND WHERE THE PC. HAS JURISDICTION OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND. THE THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES KIND OF WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE YOU SEE IS NOT INVOLVED IN SETTING UP POLICY THAT WE ARE. AND WHEN WE TRY WON'T BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT IT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE END PRODUCT. AND I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION AM MENTIONED -- SO I GET ROBO CALLS FOR MY KIDS SCHOOL WHEN THERE'S A LOCK DOWN FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE RECALL I WANT TO GET. SO HOW DOES THIS BILL HOW DO YOU PROTECTING FROM THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S A LEGAL CALL COMING FROM YOUR SCHOOL. AND IT'S NOT SOMEBODY GENERATING A FAKE CALL USING. A FAKE ID -- USAIN -- COME OF THE COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT'S INTENDED TO HIDE THEIR IDENTITIES SO. THOSE CALLS -- THE THE THIS THIS TECHNOLOGY. OTHER SHAKEN ANSWERS IS IS DESIGNED TO SPECIFICALLY. WITHOUT THOSE CALLS AND AND IT IF I WAS GIVE THIS EXAMPLE IT'S NOT. I MEAN IT'S IT'S FOR FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF HOW. THESE COMPUTER PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED. IT'S AS IF YOU EVER SEEN A SQUIGGLY LINE OR CURSIVE. WORD AND AND THERE'S A SECURITY MEASURE LET'S SAY IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT THE SAYS SO. TYPE IN WHAT WORD THIS IS IN A PROVIDE YOU THE WORD CAT IN CURSIVE THAT A COMPUTER CAN'T. UP. RIGHT SO I GUESS I WAS I AM SORRY I WASN'T CLEAR BUT SO AS OF ATTORNEY REPRESENT CORPORATIONS I KNOW THAT IF THEY HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT LIABILITY THEY'RE GONNA BE OVER BROAD. IN THEIR CREATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO AVOID LIABILITY ALLOWING ANY OF THESE POSTS CALLS THROUGH AND I THINK THAT IN SO DOING THEY COULD CAPTURE CALLS LIKE THE ONES WE WANT TO RETAIN WHICH I THINK WAS ALSO. THE CONCERN OF MISTER CALDERON MAYBE A MONTH BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T PUT LIABILITY ON THEM THAT THEN I WILL. TAKES AWAY THE POWER OF CALLS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT OUR COMMUNITIES. AND A HOW DO WE DO THAT NOW. I MEAN WHAT IS WHAT IS STOPPING -- CALLS FROM BEING BLOCK RIGHT NOW YOU MEANT THEY DID THE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU THEY JUST MENTION THAT THEY'VE BEEN BLOCK. A ROBO CALLS. AND THAT -- THERE ARECURRENTLY TAKING IN -- MEASURES NOT COMPLETE MEASURES BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO THEY'RE TRYING TO BLOCK BROKE OR BROKE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO DO SO AND ALL TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES MAY NOT BE DOING IT BUT HOW DO WE DO THAT NOW HI I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET. THERE THAT'S WHAT WHY WERE KIND OF IN THIS IN THIS POSITION WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A WITH WITH A WITH THE PROTECTION MEASURE BUT HOW DO WE DO THAT AND PROTECT THE GIVE THEM BLANK COMMUNITY. FROM DOING THAT NOW AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE CONCERN. THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE CALLS ARE COMING IN THAT ARE GONNA BE JEFF JAMMING UP THE THE THE TELEPHONE LINES AND THAT HAS -- THERE'S A LIABILITY SUITS SO STATE WITH THAT TOO BECAUSE THEY PER THEY PROMISED TO PROVIDE. YOU TELEPHONE SERVICE. AND IN IN THAT THEIR PROVIDE -- CALLS ARE GETTING THROUGH THAT ARE ARE. ROBIN PEOPLE OF MONEY. CALLS ARE GETTING THROUGH MISLEADING PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR TRUE ORIGINS AND THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS AND THAT IS ALSO A LIABILITY THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE HOW WE CREATE A PERFECT ALL THE PROTECTION FROM LIABILITY ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER. AND AND JUST CONTINUES TO BLOCK THESE CALLS IT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE BUT I I'M STILL SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR POSITION LIKE YOU ARE. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE BILL ESSENTIALLY TARGETS THE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS -- TO BASICALLY HELP SCREEN OUT SOME OF THESE -- PROBLEMS -- THE R. EVERYTHING AT MY COLLEAGUE HAS HAVE SAID I DID OLD -- YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT MANY OF THESE CALLS ACTUALLY COME IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES EVEN -- YOU KNOW SO I THINK THE THE THE NEW IMMIGRANTS ARE EXAMPLES OF THE ELDERLY ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THESE CALLS. BUT I UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SOME AMENDMENTS SO THAT I CAN BE TAKEN AT THE NEXT STOP CAN YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THE PROPOSAL MADE WELL WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND AND IT'S KIND OF A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT OUR OUR IDEAS. TO AGAIN -- TRY TO LIMIT THAT LIABILITIES MUCH AS POSSIBLE WERE FOCUSING ON THE LIABILITIES AS MUCH AS WE CAN. AND AS I MENTIONED IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. VERY GOOD. THE BILL HAS BEEN. THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- WHICH THE IT RECOGNITION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS ONE MORE QUESTION MR GABLE GO AHEAD YEAH I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE AUTHOR FIRST I WANT TO COMPLIMENT YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR I HAVE -- AS WE IS YOU KNOW WE DISCUSSED OF A A MEASURE THAT I THINK IS VERY COMPLEMENTARY I KNOW THAT EVERYONE HERE PROBABLY. SHARES OUR CONCERNS ABOUT CALLER ID SPOOFING IT'S A REAL ISSUE FOR CONSUMERS IN THE STATE -- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE UNDERSTAND THE STEAK THE SHEIK CONSIDER TECHNOLOGY. DOES THAT ACTUALLY BLOCK CALLS OR JUST AUTHENTICATE THEM INTEL'S PHOTO SYNDICATES CALL RIGHT SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY GONNA BLOCK THE COLLAR ON CALL FROM THE SCHOOL -- OR FROM A LEDGE OR FOR ANY WITH SOMEONE THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR ANYONE WHO'S THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT A LEGITIMATE USE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GONNA OPERABLE CALLING IT'S JUST GONNA HELP YOU HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE. THAT WHEN YOU SEE THAT NUMBER THAT IT'S ACTUALLY FROM WHAT THE CALLER ID SAYS IT'S FROM THAT'S CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S OCCURRED. VERY GOOD WITH THAT THOUGH WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES SENATOR -- JUST SIMPLY. AGAIN -- IMAGINE A WORLD OR 40% OF YOUR CALLS. OUR FRAUDULENT. AND TRYING TO SCAM YOU OF YOUR MONEY I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AND THAT THE INDUSTRY IS MOVING TOWARD TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN DO THIS AND WE JUST WANT. TO KIND OF YOU KNOW. MOVE THAT UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE AND WE HAVE OTHER JURISDICTIONS MOVING FORWARD WITH SIMILAR LAWSON CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE. AS THE INNOVATION STATE THE LEADER IN THIS AREA AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR -- AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE WALL.
