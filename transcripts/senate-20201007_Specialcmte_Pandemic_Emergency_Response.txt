THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WILL MOVE ON WITH DOUG PARKER THANK YOU. MR PARKER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON GONZALEZ MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM THAT PARKER CHIEF OF CAL OSHA I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. ABOUT CALLUSES RESPONSE TO THE COPA NINETEEN CRISIS. FIRST I WANT TO ECHO DIRECTOR HAGENS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE TREMENDOUS WORK AND SACRIFICE OF FIRST RESPONDERS AND OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS- THEY'VE CONTINUED TO CARE FOR US FEED US TRANSPORT US- CONSTRUCTOR HOMES AND PROVIDE US WITH OTHER- ESSENTIAL NEEDS- AND- SOME OF THEM. TOO MANY HAVE TRAGICALLY LOST THEIR LIVES PROVIDING THE REST OF US WITH THESE NECESSITIES. QALISYA WE TRY TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON PROTECTING THOSE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO FACE THE GREATEST RISK. AND WE HAVE ALSO TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF WORKER PROTECTION DURING THE CRISIS. CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL LEADER AND WORKER HEALTH WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS IN MAINTAINING THOSE HIGH STANDARDS IS NOT A GOAL WE HAVE TRIED TO MAINTAIN AS WE APPROACH THE CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE AN OUTLINE OF OUR STRATEGY FOR RESPONDING TO THE COVE IN NINETEEN CRISIS. WE REALIZED EARLY ON THAT WE HAD TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT WAS ON A SCALE MUCH LARGER. THAN WE WERE GONNA BE ABLE TO HANDLE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL SO WE HAD TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS- AND WE TRY TO FOCUS ON THREE THINGS. FIRST IS LEVERAGING OUR KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO DEVELOP GUIDANCE REGULATIONS- SO THAT EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE COVER NINETEEN CRISIS. NUMBER TO FIND WAYS TO EDUCATE AS MANY OF THOSE EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS AS POSSIBLE ABOUT HOW TO. IMPLEMENT OVER NINETEEN PROTECTIONS AND THEN THIRD FIFTEEN YOU CAN FORCE WHEN EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THE GREATEST NUMBER OF WORKERS GIVEN OUR FINITE RESOURCES RELATIVE TO THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. FOR THE FIRST STRATEGY LEVERAGING EXPERTISE. WE FOCUSED ON TWO THINGS. PRIMARILY IN MARCH WE BEGAN DEVELOPING BECAUSE THE NINETEEN GUIDANCE. AND TO DATE WE HAVE ISSUED OUR CO ISSUES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. MORE THAN WHAT KINDS FOR MORE THAN FORTY INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPLIANCE TOOLS. THESE ARE ALL AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE OF BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND- AND- CALLOSUM. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING AN EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STANDARD TO ADDRESS COVE IN NINETEEN. IF IT IF APPROVED IT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE FIRST STATES IN THE NATION TO HAVE. IN LAW WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS SPECIFIC TO COPE AT NINETEEN. FOR OUR SECOND STRATEGY EDUCATION OUT REACH WE HAVE WORK TO COMPLEMENT THE ADMINISTRATION'S BROADER OUTREACH EFFORTS BY FOCUSING ON THE WORKPLACE. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH MEXICAN CONSULATES AND WORKER ADVOCACY GROUPS TO. REACH LOW WAGE AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS WE'VE EMAILED- GUIDANCE AS THE DIRECTOR HAGEN MENTIONED WE FEEL THAT THOUSANDS OF CALLS FROM EMPLOYERS TO ADVISE THEM ON BEST PRACTICES. AND WE'RE CONDUCTING WEBINARS THAT- THAT ACCOMMODATE A THOUSAND PEOPLE AT A TIME TO PROVIDE IN DEPTH VIRTUAL TRAINING WE'VE ALSO PARTNERED WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO FOCUS OUT REACH. IN HIGH RISK WORKPLACES SUCH AS AGRICULTURE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES INTO PROCESSING. AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S STRATEGIC FACT TASK FORCE- WE'VE MADE MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND IN PERSON COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE VISITS TO PLAYERS IN THE STATE- AND AS A WHOLE THE TASK FORCE IS MADE MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CONTACTS WITH EMPLOYERS. OUR THIRD STRATEGY. STRATEGIC ENFORCEMENT HAS MANAGED. TARGETING THE HIGHEST RISK WORKPLACES AND INDUSTRIES. FOCUSING ON GEOGRAPHIC HOT SPOTS AS PART OF THE STATE'S TASK FORCES. AND COMMUNICATED OUR FORCE AND EFFORTS TO THE PUBLIC TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE. TO IMPLEMENT THAT WE'VE OPENED CLOSE TO TWELVE HUNDRED COVER NINETY INSPECTION SINCE FEBRUARY. WE'VE ISSUED CITATIONS THAT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT EFFECT INCLUDING THE HIGHEST MONETARY PENALTIES ISSUED IN ANY STATE IN THE NATION FOR OVER NINETEEN. AND WE HAVE ACTIVELY PUBLICIZE OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE. IN TERMS OF OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE OF OUR INSPECTIONS ABOUT 25% HAVE BEEN-HEALTHCARE INCLUDING HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN INSPECTIONS ALMOST 20% HAVE BEEN IN AGRICULTURE. BECAUSE IMMIGRANT AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ARE OFTEN UNAWARE FEARFUL ABOUT FIND A FILING COMPLAINTS WITH US THE MAJORITY OF THOSE INSPECTIONS WERE STRATEGIC AND NOT COMPLYING OR IN THE SPACE- WE ALSO DID OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE. ACT WE'VE GOT ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT INSPECTION INSPECTIONS IN THE RETAIL TRADING LOOTING GROCERY STORES. AND HUNDRED TWENTY THREE IN MANUFACTURING INCLUDING THIRTY THREE INSPECTIONS AT TO PROCESSING FACILITIES WHICH WERE ALSO- IN MANY CASES FOR TEACHING INSPECTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WORK WE'VE CONDUCTED IN THE SAME TIME FRAME OVER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NON CODE INSPECTIONS- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND CONTINUE TO CARRY OUT OUR OTHER MANDATE TO INVESTIGATE ACCIDENTS AND INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS THANK YOU MISTER PARKER. THANK YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO FINISH THE LAST- PIECE WE CAN THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND WE CAN MOVE ON SURE I WAS JUST GONNA MENTION AND WE'VE ALSO DONE COMPLIANCE CHECKS FOR COVERT IN THOSE INSPECTIONS WELL WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING TO DO OUR JOB BETTER WE BELIEVE OUR APPROACH IS THE RIGHT ONE AND IT'S MADE US HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE FORMED MISTER PARKER WE APPRECIATE THAT. SKINNER LAST PRESENTER FROM OUR FIRST PANEL TODAY WILL BE DR BARBARA MATERNA OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND DR MATERNA HAS WITH HER DOCTOR KATHLEEN JACOBSON AS WELL. TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL FROM OUR FROM OUR SENATORS. WELCOME DR MATERNA. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS HI OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH BRANCH IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME SOME OF WHAT CITY PAGES DURING ON THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. I WILL FOCUS MY BRIEF REMARKS ON FOUR TOPICS I WAS ASKED TO COVER. THE FIRST TOPIC IS COVER NINETEEN OUTBREAKS IN THE WORKPLACES HOW WE ARE NOTIFIED ABOUT THEM AND WHAT WE DO TO RESPOND AND ASSIST EMPLOYERS. CDPH IS NOTIFIED ABOUT OUTBREAKS THROUGH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. I WOULD BREAK IT IS DEFINED DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF WORKPLACE OR COMMUNITY SETTING. FOR NON HEALTH CARE WORKPLACES CDPH DEFINES AN OUTBREAK AS THREE OR MORE COATED NINETEEN CASES WITHIN A FOURTEEN DAY PERIOD AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS. THE DEFINITION FOR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES HAS MORE DETAILED CRITERIA AND IS OUTLINED IN OUR OFFICE FACILITIES LETTER ISSUED SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND. MOST LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL ENTER DATA INTO THE OUTBREAK MODULE OF THIS CD PH ELECTRONIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE REPORTING SYSTEM WE'RE CAL READY. WHERE THEY CAN CHOOSE AMONG THE LISTED TYPES OF WORKPLACE OR COMMUNITY SETTINGS OR SPECIFY OTHER AND ENTER THE REQUESTED INFORMATION BREAKS IN HEALTH CARE FACILITIES ARE ALSO IDENTIFIED AND TRACKED BY DIRECT EMPLOYER REPORTING FOR EXAMPLE. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES MUST REPORT CODE NINETEEN CASES IN WORKERS OR RESIDENTS DIRECTLY TO CDPH VIA A DAILY SURVEY. OPRAH CHRIS PINE IS TYPICALLY HANDLED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAD THE LEAD ROLE THAT MAY REQUEST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM CDPH. WHEN REQUESTED BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE CAN ASSIST THROUGH OUR SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATION TEAMS FOR HEALTH CARE CORRECTIONS RESIDENTIAL CONGREGATE SETTINGS AND NON HEALTH CARE NON RESIDENTIAL CONGREGATE SETTINGS. WITH RESPECT TO WHAT OUR REGION ASSISTANCE WE PROVIDE TO EMPLOYERS EXPERIENCING AN OUTBREAK. CDPH ALL FACILITIES LETTERS AND OTHER GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS ARE USED TO ADVISE HEALTH CARE EMPLOYERS ON ALL ASPECTS OF COOLEY NINETEEN PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. CDPH HAS ALSO PRODUCED A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT RESPONDING TO CODE NINETEEN IN THE WORKPLACE WHICH VERSIONS FOR BOTH EMPLOYERS AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WAS FIRST ISSUED. IN JUNE A REVISED IN SEPTEMBER. THIS PROVIDES A STEP CHECK TO ASSIST WITHOUT PROGRESS IN ON HEALTH CARE NON CONGREGATE SETTINGS. A CATEGORY THAT INCLUDES FOOD MEAT OR POULTRY PROCESSING WAREHOUSES GROCERY STORES AT CENTER. CDPH COLLABORATES WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS EMPLOYERS AND OTHER AGENCIES SUCH AS CAL OSHA TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL CONSULTATION ON SPECIFIC OUTBREAKS. OUR HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS PROGRAM SENDS INFECTION PREVENTION NURSE ON SITE TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES IN WORKPLACES INCLUDING HOSPITALS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND IN SOME CASES CORRECTIONS. WE ALSO PROVIDE TECHNICAL CONSULTATION FOR EXAMPLE OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE OR INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE EXPERTISE EPIDEMIOLOGY SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE AND TESTING STRATEGIES. THROUGH PHONE CALLS INVOLVING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND AFFECTED EMPLOYERS AND WE HAVE PROVIDED ON SITE ASSISTANCE IN SOME HIGH PROFILE PROFILE SITUATIONS. IN COLLABORATION WITH CAL OSHA WE'RE NOW BEING BEGINNING TO PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE. THIS WILL INCLUDE ORIGINAL PLAYERS ON THE LOS REQUIREMENT THAT THEY REPORT OUTBREAKS TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. OUR EPIDEMIOLOGISTS ARE CURRENTLY ANALYZING DATA IN THE OUTBREAK MUNJAL PERTAINING TO WORKPLACE SETTINGS AND THIS WILL INFORM OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION OF OUTBREAKS BY IN JUST INDUSTRY SETTING AND THE REPORTING OF THAT INFORMATION. THE SECOND TOPIC WE ARE ASKED ABOUT IS WHAT WE CONSIDER IN DEVELOPING EMPLOYER GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. CDPH SPEND WORKING WITH BOTH CAL OSHA AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPING INDUSTRY SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR CORPORATE PER NINETEEN PREVENTION. SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS WE. THINK ABOUT IN DEVELOPING THIS GUIDANCE OUR GENERAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH PRINCIPLES ON HOW TO CONTROL AEROSOL TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES THROUGH A RANGE OF ENGINEERING WORK PRACTICE AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT CONTROLS. WE CONSIDER THE EVOLVING SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT KOBE NINETEEN INCLUDING INFORMATION ON WHERE TRANSMISSION HAS OCCURRED AND HOW. WE CONSIDER THE GUIDANCE FROM CDC THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH FEDERAL OSHA OTHER STATE AGENCIES HEALTH AND SAFETY PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS. WE TAILOR THIS GUIDANCE TO THE WORK PROCESSES AND UNIQUE SITUATIONS IN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES WHILE MAKING AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY ACROSS THESE DOCUMENTS. WE FIRST PRODUCE GUIDANCE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKER INDUSTRIES AND THEN FOR SECTORS THAT WOULD BE ANTICIPATING RE OPENING IN ORDER TO HELP THEM TO PLAN AHEAD. WE'VE ALSO SOUGHT INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH EMPLOYER AND WORKER ORGANIZATIONS. AND A FINAL CONSIDERATION IS THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THESE DOCUMENTS THROUGH OUR WEBSITES BY MAKING THEM AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND DISSEMINATING THEM THROUGH BROAD OUTREACH. THE THIRD TOPIC IS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN EMPLOYER CANNOT PROCURE WHAT IS NEEDED. CDPH ONLY HANDLES PP REQUESTS FOR MEDICAL AND HEALTH RESOURCES FROM HEALTH CARE EMPLOYERS. SO REQUESTS FROM NON HEALTH CARE EMPLOYERS ARE DEALT WITH THROUGH THE STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THANK YOU DR MATERNAL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUST WRAP UP IF YOU WANT TO. FINALIZE THAT POINT. OKAY AND THAT POINT WAS THAT THE MEDICAL HEALTH OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATION PROGRAMMER MY WEB PROGRAM IS HOW THESE RESOURCES THREE. REQUESTED FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL TO THE REGIONAL LEVEL AND AFTER THIS COUPLE. AND I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THE FOURTH TOPIC WAS AROUND EMPLOYEE TESTING AND- I HAVE A COLLEAGUE WITH ME HERE TODAY DR. CATHY JACOBSON WHO IS AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT COME UP ON THAT TOPIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH DR MATERNA NOW- THAT CONCLUDES OUR FIRST PANEL AND WE WILL BE TAKING IT BACK TO DISCUSSION BETWEEN MEMBERS SO. THE FIRST NUMBER I HAVE IS SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU CHAIR GONZALEZ- YES SOME QUESTIONS- FOR- CAL OSHA AND DA R. NINETY ONE I THINK I KNOW IF I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH- MISTER PARKER CHIEF PARKER. IN CONJUNCTION WITH C. DPH ABOUT- GETTING MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE TO. THE TICKET BUSINESSES THERE BY CAR CUSTOMER FACING STAFF CUSTOMERS COMING IN LIKE RESTAURANTS AND RETAIL AND SO FORTH- BECAUSE THERE'S A- FOR PLACES A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN. ONES THAT MAY NOT- IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF CONTROL AND OF COURSE THAT INCLUDES GROCERY STORES. I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE HE SPOKE TO ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION APPRECIATE THAT- DO YOU DOES. HELLO SHOULD FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO REALLY GET. LAWYERS TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIORS QUICKLY ALL RIGHT SO THIS IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IT SPREADS EXPONENTIALLY. THERE'S A TIME PRESSURED TO HAVE SOMETHING DONE RIGHT AWAY NOT LIKE WELL WE'LL GIVE YOU TIME TO FIX THINGS AND SO FORTH SO FOR EXAMPLE. DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO COME IN AND SHUT DOWN A PLACE UNTIL IT'S ACTUALLY RENDERED SAFE SO YOU GO IN YOU SEE INSPECTION. IT'S GREAT YOU CAN SEND OF A FINE. CITATION BUT I MEAN CLOSE THE WORKPLACE DOWN UNTIL IT'S FIXED RIGHT AND WE TALK ABOUT FINES. I APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE RECORD FINES. BUT REALLY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHART TELL THAT BUSINESS YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE PAYING ALL THE WORKERS THEIR FULL SALARY WHILE YOU FIX THE PLACE BECAUSE WE CAN'T PEALIZE THE WORKERS. FOR AN UNSAFE WORKPLACE AND THEN IN ORDER TO SHUT THE PLACE DOWN UNTIL IT'S FIXED SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOUR STORY TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. IF NECESSARY TO ENSURE A SAFE WORKPLACE- SO SPEEDILY BE ABLE TO SHUT THE PLACE DOWN. REQUIRE THEY MAKE THE CHANGES CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE WORKERS UNTIL AS THOSE CHANGES ARE BEING MADE. DO YOU HAVE THAT AUTHORITY OR DO YOU NEED AUTHORITY FROM THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU SENATOR PAM AUTHORITY ALLOWS US TO ISSUE AN ORDER PROHIBITING USE THAT WORD- CLOSE AN AFFECTED AREA OF THE BUSINESS IN THE EVENT OF AN IMMINENT HAZARD SO IF THERE WAS A YEAR OF AN IMMINENT THREAT OF A HAZARD THAT WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT LIFE FOR SERIOUS ILLNESS. WE HAVE TO IN THE COURSE OF DOING THAT. GATHER SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO- TO SUSTAIN THAT IS THE SAME THAT ORDER IN IN A HEARING BECAUSE THE EMPLOYERS HAVE. A RIGHT TO A HEARING AND SO WE TYPICALLY GATHER EVIDENCE ON THAT POINT. WE HAVE. ACTIVELY EXPLORED A NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH WE CONSIDER ORDERS- BUT IN THOSE CASES- WE ACHIEVED. YOU KNOW COMPLIANCE FROM THE EMPLOYER BEFORE WE ISSUED ANY ORDERS BUT YES WE DO HAVE THAT AUTHORITY- THERE WAS- SOME AMBIGUITY BECAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN TESTED WITH RESPECT TO COVER NINETEEN. IN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING ON THE COURTS- AND SO JUST TO CLARIFY AND DISPEL ANY ANY AMBIGUITY ABOUT THAT- WE'RE PROUD OF WE'RE PLEASED THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE. WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY DEFINES A COVE IN NINETEEN AS AN IMMINENT HAZARD. IF WE- YOU KNOW I IDENTIFY SITUATION WORKPLACE WHERE WHERE THAT EXPOSURE IS YOU KNOW MEET THE STANDARD- AND SO WE DO HAVE THAT AUTHORITY AND I BELIEVE UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN WE ISSUE ISSUE THOSE ORDERS. THERE IS AN OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO PAY WORKERS AT LEAST TOP I CAN GET BACK. TO YOU ON THE ON THE SPECIFICS OF THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN AM NEXT I HAVE CENTER COMING AT ALL WITH HER HAND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE PRESENTERS I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDED DAY AND I AM- IT. THE DETAIL IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- BEFORE WE GET TO THE NEXT PANEL WHICH IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT I WOULD I A WAS CONCERNED WITH THE VACANCY- AT ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED AND I THOUGHT WHAT I HEARD IS THAT. THERE IS AN EFFORT TO FILL SIXTY FIVE VACANCIES. WITHIN THE NEXT I THINK THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND THEN IT IT SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER SEVENTY VACANCIES AFTER THAT AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HOW MANY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN IN WHICH UNIT ARE THESE AND WHY ARE WE SO FAR BEHIND- AND IF THIS IF THIS NUMBER IS TRUE- WHAT KIND OF WHAT LED UP TO AS BEING. SO FAR BEHIND IN IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF FILLING VACANCIES AND IN MAKING SURE WE HAD. ENOUGH STAFF THEN HAVE A SECOND. THEM QUESTION. THE QUESTIONS ABOUT PROCESS. BURKE SURE. THANK YOU SENATOR GOVERNOR WITHOUT DIRECTED TOWARDS- BELIEVE THAT IT'D PROBABLY BE- DIRECTOR READY TO HIT TAKEN OKAY YEAH YOU CAN CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN. RIGHT M. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. YES ARE THE NUMBERS DO YOU INDICATED ARE ARE ACCURATE AND THOSE NUMBERS REPRESENT AN EXISTING VACANCIES- AT CAL OSHA- THE SIXTY FIVE UP POSITIONS THAT WE'RE TARGETING TO FILL BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. ARE SPECIFICALLY ENFORCEMENT RELATED POSITIONS SO WHILE WE BORROWED STAFF FROM OTHER AGENCIES WE'RE WE HIRED- A NUMBER OF TEMPORARY STAFF TO HELP SHORE US UP UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO FILL. A NUMBER OF OUR VACANCIES- SO WE'RE TARGETING ENFORCEMENT AT PRESENT- AND WE'VE HIRED- APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE PEOPLE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS- THE MAJORITY OF THOSE BEING IN THE ENFORCEMENT AREA. THE OTHER SEVENTY VACANCIES ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER- POSITIONS ACROSS CALLOW SINCE IT'S A FAIRLY LARGE ORGANIZATION- ATTORNEYS- ELEVATOR INSPECTORS- SUPPORT STAFF YOU KNOW IT'S A WHOLE VARIETY. BUT OUTSIDE OF THE ENFORCEMENT AREA- WE- BUT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT MY UP TO THE BIG RATE IS A MORE COMPLICATED- STORY THAT AT. YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT A- COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN AUDIT CONDUCTED- AT THE I. R. WHICH LED TO- THEY'RE HIRING IS THE WORD EAT BEING- HOLD AND- WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE- WE HAVE TO GO TO CONTROL AGENCY FOR APPROVAL- FOR ALL OF OUR HIRES- SO THAT. THAT IS ONE PIECE OF IT WE HAVE- IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF- TACTICS AROUND FILLING NOT JUST CAL OSHA VACANCIES BUT ALL THE VACANCIES WITHIN D. I. R. WITH CALLOSUM. BEING OUR PRIORITY SINCE THEY'RE REALLY ON THE FRONT LINES OF- CALLS IT. FORSMAN AND OUTREACH. BUT THE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING FROM JUST PUTTING INTO PLACE A HIRING PROTOCOLS TRAINING MANAGERS ON APPROPRIATE HIRING PRACTICES- CONDUCTING A NATIONWIDE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS FOR SAFETY ENGINEERS AN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST- THERE WERE A NUMBER OF EXAMINATIONS THAT HAD EXPIRED DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME- BUT THE DEPARTMENT WAS UNDER AUDIT AND SUBSEQUENTLY. WE NEEDED TO RE ESTABLISH THOSE EXAMINATIONS IN ORDER TO GET A CANDIDATE POOL- SO THERE WERE A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT NEEDED TO BE TAKEN BEFORE- WE COULD BRING ON PEOPLE PERMANENTLY INTO THESE VERY PROFESSIONAL HIGHLY SKILLED POSITIONS- AND- WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS WE'VE GOT- IN ADDITION TO THAT THE TWENTY THREE HIRES THAT I MENTIONED WE HAVE NINETEEN THAT ARE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF HIRING AN EASIER IN OUR ENFORCEMENT AREA AGAIN. I'M IN THIRTY SIX AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY SIX THAT ARE IN THE RECRUITMENT FACE- SO WE BELIEVE THAT AS LONG AS YOU KNOW OUR CANDIDATE POOL REMAINS HEALTHY WHICH IT HAS BEEN A BEEN VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES THAT WANT TO COME WORK FOR CAL OSHA- AS LONG AS THAT MAINTAINS WE BELIEVE WILL BE. OUR TARGET FOR THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT AND- ON. THAT SUBJECT FOR A LONGER DISCUSSION I THINK JUST IN TERMS OF. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PRODUCING THE WORK FORCE IT CAN WORK THE WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN DO THE WORK THAT WE NEED DONE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THEN. ON THE OTHER THE OTHER. THE QUESTION AND THEN YOU SEE IF I CAN GET THIS OUT QUICKLY IS. I'M I'M I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE AS I HAVE- REPRESENT SIX COUNTIES AND AS I WAS. TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING TO PROTECT THE WORK FORCE. IT WAS CONFUSING TO ME EXACTLY WHERE THE REPORTING. BOB BREAKDOWN OCCURRED. IT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT EACH COUNTY WAS ASKING THE QUESTION. ABOUT THE I BELIEVE IT WAS- AT. THE END THE INFECTION RATE BY INDUSTRY SETTING WHICH- WHICH WOULD TELL US. OR WOULD IT IS TRACED BACK TO A PARTICULAR WORKPLACE- AND TELL US A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND SO WHEN I ASK THAT. THE PUBLIC HEALTH. OFFICERS WELL FIRST OF ALL THIS WE HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES THAT ARE GOING OUT IN ISSUING ORDERS AND THEN ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR CAL OSHA. AND I'M IT I'M INTERESTED IN IN THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THAT WHETHER THAT THERE'S THEY WORK TAKE WHETHER YOU WORK TOGETHER. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME OF THE INSPECTIONS- I AND- AND R. IS THE INFORMATION IS BEING GIVEN OUT ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT. THE WORKERS CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE ORGANIZATIONS NUMBER ONE AND THEN TWO IS- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. A BETTER A REPORTING REQUIREMENT. FROM THE EMPLOYER TO THE COUNTY OR CAL COUNTY. THE INFECTION RATE BUT ALSO THAT THE EMPLOYEE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO REPORT THAT. AS WELL BECAUSE MANY TIMES WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE EMPLOYERS PERSPECTIVE AS THEY FIND OUT AFTER THE FACT IN SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE FACT THAT AN EMPLOYEE HAS BECOME SICK BECAUSE OF CODE NINETEEN NUMBER ONE IS IT WAS HARD TO GET TESTED SO PEOPLE'S. DIDN'T GET THE TEST WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE AND THEN IT DIDN'T GET RECORDED LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE MECHANISM. THAT WE NEED IN PLACE MY MISUMI THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST PANDEMIC WE HAVE TO FACE IT SO WE NEED TO SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE WE GET REALLY GOOD REPORTING SO WE CAN SEE THINGS. PROSPECTIVELY RATHER THAN WAITING TILL AFTER THE FACT AND THEN. HAVING TO TAKE A COMPLAINT FROM. FROM FROM A WORKER IF WE CAN SEE THINGS AHEAD OF TIME IT WOULD BE A LOT BETTER SO SOMEBODY COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND CAL OSHA AND THEN AND THEN WHAT KIND OF REPORTING GAPS WE HAVE THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US TO CATCH SOME OF THESE- WORKPLACE- ISSUES. AHEAD OF TIME. RATHER THAN SEVEN MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD. THANK YOU SENATOR COMING AT ALL I THINK THAT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS DIRECTOR HAGEN AND MISTER PARKER. HE SAID THAT I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD WAIT AT. SO I CAN I CAN BEGIN. WE DO RECEIVED A DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION THE- THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA- LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS DO NOT RECEIVED INFORMATION ABOUT- BECAUSE THE POSITIVE CASES- MY AND YOU MAY WANNA ASK CDPH BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS PRIMARILY RECEIVED FROM MEDICAL PROVIDERS. WHEREAS WE RECEIVED- REPORTS FROM EMPLOYERS HOWEVER WE ONLY RECEIVED THOSE REPORTS WHEN THERE IS A HOSPITALIZATION. OR WHEN THERE IS A FATALITY AND- SO YOU KNOW TODAY WE'VE RECEIVED EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SIX OF THESE ELSE SERIOUS ILLNESS REPORTS AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF THESE FATALITY REPORTS WHICH I BELIEVE ARE VAST. BESIDES FAST UNDER REPORTING- BY EMPLOYERS AND IT MAY BE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. IN TERMS OF OUR WERE WORKING TOGETHER WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON A NUMBER OF CASES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE I DID EARLY ON WAS TO REACH OUT TO ALL THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS IN THE STATE. TO LET THEM KNOW THAT- HOW TO REACH US THIS WAS ALSO PART OF THE CDPH. AMPLIAR PLAYBOOK YOU MAY RECALL AND- AND LET US KNOW IF STAY- HAVE PRIORITIES IF THERE'S INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION ONE SHARE THEY SHOULD REACH OUT TO US ABOUT YOUR WORK PLACES THAT THEY FIND PROBLEMATIC. AND THEN THIS AND HAPPENING- I THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY SPEND MORE. FOR BEEN MORE AD HOC THE SYSTEM. IT BASED ON JUST THE PART LOCAL PRIORITIES. ANALYSTS SAY THAT WITH EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE WE THINK THAT. BRING ON A NEW REQUIREMENT WHICH IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO NOTIFY OCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS OF COKE A CASES REGARDLESS OF MAKING ANY KIND OF DETERMINATIONS ABOUT. WHERE THEY CAME FROM OR WHETHER THEIR WORK RELATED IS GOING TO BE IN A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL IN CUTTING DOWN THE- THAT TIME LINE THE TIME IT TAKES TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO AN INCIDENT WHICH I THINK. KIND OF GOES TO THE CORE PROBLEM- THAT'S SERIALIZER AND IF YOUR QUESTION. WELL IF I COULD I MEAN PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I'M I'M HEARING IS THAT- IN SOME OF THE BIG INDUSTRIES YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT- PEOPLE THAT DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO. WORK WE'RE GOING TO WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY WERE HIGH RISK FOR WILL BE THERE FOR BECAUSE OF A MAJOR BECAUSE OF. EXIST CONDITIONS AND YOU HAD PEOPLE THAT WERE SICK BUT DIDN'T HAVE COPING GONE AND SO. EVEN THE EMPLOYER HAD NO WAY OF BEING ABLE TO ASCERTAIN WHY SOMEBODY WASN'T AT THE OFFICE OR OR AT THAT LOCATION- AND IN PARTICULAR IN SOME OF OUR RURAL SETTINGS- THERE THERE THERE CAN BE A REAL. HEAVY TURNOVER WITH CONTRACT LABOR BEING USED AS THAT AS THE AS THE BACKSTOP AND SOME I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET TO HOW DO YOU SET UP AN OBLIGATION FOR AN EMPLOYER TO DO SOMETHING. IF THERE IF. IF THERE ARE PROTECTIONS. PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON UNLESS THAT EMPLOYEE IS FORTHCOMING. AND I'M I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S- YOU KNOW HOW WE SET UP THE SYSTEM. SO THAT THAT THERE ARE MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS BETWEEN. LADIES AND- AND THEN THEN IT GETS REPORTED CONSISTENTLY TO THE SAME. TO THE SAME ENTITY BECAUSE I ALSO. HEARD AND I DIDN'T GET IT DONE QUICKLY AND BUT THAT THERE IS SOME REPORTING THAT HAPPENS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEN THERE'S OTHER REPORTING THAT HAPPENED TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND HOW HOW WOULD. AN INDIVIDUALKNOW WHO THEY SHOULD REPORT EITHER AND ELLIS TWO OR AND DEATH. TO ON. THIS IS IT HAS SO MANY HOLES IN IT THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR SOME SOME TO FALL THROUGH AND WE DON'T GET A REAL CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY. WELL IT IS TRUE THAT- THAT I'M FOR CAN'T REPORT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT- ONE OF THE- WAYS THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED THAT IN OUR GUIDANCE. THAT WE'VE ISSUE WITH C. DPH IS TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE. WORKERS TO REPORT ILLNESSES AND SYMPTOMS AND ALSO. MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYERS EMPHASIZE THIS IN TRAINING THAT THEY PROVIDE TO EMPLOYEES TO SORT OF IMPROVE THAT LINE OF COMMUNICATION SO THAT. THESE ARE AWARE AND SO THAT THEY CAN REPORT IN A TIMELY WAY IN TERMS OF YOUR WHO REPORTS TO WHO- I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR OUR AGENCY AND WE HAVE LONG STANDING REGULATIONS IN PLACE ABOUT REPORTING SERIOUS ILLNESSES. AND OBLIGATIONS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO ALSO RECORD THESE IN THEIR OWN- LONG THREE HUNDRED FORMS THESE ARE THESE ARE. THESE ARE INTERNAL RECORDS THAT REPRESENT EMPLOYERS MAINTAIN AND WE'VE ALSO PUT FAQS ON OUR WEBSITE TO HELP EMPLOYERS NAVIGATE THE QUESTION OF HOW THEY DETERMINE WHETHER TO REPORT. A CO THAT NINETEEN ILLNESS AND AGAIN I THINK THAT- WITH THE- WITH THE PASSAGE O SB SIX A FIVE THAT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSE SOME OF THESE SIGNIFICANT GAPS- I CAN'T SAY THAT WE WILL CLOSE ALL OF THEM IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION. WELL IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SITUATION I BELIEVE. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR KABBADI AT ALL- NEXT WERE GONNA MOVE ON TO SENATOR JACKSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY UM AND I APPRECIATE HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS BEEN WE GOT THROWN INTO THIS CHAOS- WITHOUT A PADDLE IF YOU WILL- AND IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET MUCH HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SO WE KIND OF HAD TO. LEARN AS WE GO BUT THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THE SITUATION THAT HAPPENED AT FOSTER FARMS THAT WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE DAY AFTER DAY WEEK AFTER WEEK WHEN BOTH THE COUNTY AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS KNEW THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT OUTBREAK- THAT THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO IGNORE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RULES- AND THAT WORKERS WERE IN DANGER- BUT- IT TOOK I BELIEVE UNTIL THE DEATHS OF EIGHT PEOPLE. ARE TO SHUT THE PLANT DOWN AND I'M WONDERING- WHAT TEST. SINCE FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING. TO AND THAT KIND OF- NEGLIGENCE- ICE I ASSUME THAT THERE ARE FINE STATE YOU'VE GIVEN SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS WHAT ARE THE EXTENT OF THOSE FINES HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THEM. AND THEN ARE THOSE COMPANIES ALSO SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE- LITIGATION- BY THE FAMILIES OF PEOPLE OF BOTH BEEN INJURED. WITH THE ILLNESS OR DIED- AND WHAT YOU THINK OF THE ABILITY TO BRING- HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR THOSE FOLKS IN ADDITION TO. AYE YOUR- ABILITY TO- TO FIND HIM ARE THERE LIMITS TO IT HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHAT THE FINE SHOULD BE AND AGAIN AS SOMEONE WHO REALLY. TAKES ENFORCEMENT SERIOUSLY- WHAT MORE CAN OR SHOULD WE BE DOING TO ENFORCE THE PROTECTION SO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH THE PEOPLE DYING BECAUSE A COMPANY DECIDES THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO COMPLAIN SOMEHOW OR OTHER. ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATING YOUR RESPECTIVE OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING. SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON. AND THAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS. DIRECTOR HAGEN AS WELL AS MISTER PARKER PERHAPS DR-MATERNA AND DOCTOR JACOBSON AS WELL CAN. ALSO FOLLOW UP. I CAN I CAN BEGIN FOSTER FARMS WAS A TRAGEDY. AND SHOULD IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT PREVENT IT I BELIEVE. WE'RE CONDUCTING AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION THERE AND SO THAT PUTS SOME LIMITS ON WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THE CASE- HOWEVER I CAN SAY THAT WE ARE- ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANY VIOLATED THE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS AND WHAT THOSE MAY BE AND WE ARE ALSO INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR NOT- THE COMPANY VIOLATED THE LAW AND NOT IMMEDIATELY REPORTING A FATALITIES AND SERIOUS ILLNESSES TO CAL OSHA- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL COME OF THE INVESTIGATION ULTIMATELY THERE ARE AT LEAST SHOULDN'T SPECULATE ON IT WHILE THE INVESTIGATION IS OPEN- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN BETTER AND FASTER INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE DEATHS AND POSITIVE CASES- THAT. WE COULD HAVE INTERVENE MORE EFFECTIVELY. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT- THAT IT AGAIN AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ARE GONNA HELP SITUATIONS LIKE THAT AND SPEED ACTION IN RESPONSE. AND I CAN ALSO SAY THAT- WE ARE YOU KNOW I HAVE MEETINGS IN THE NEXT DAY OR WEEK DEPEND I WANT TO GET SCHEDULED WITH- CDPH AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT AND HAVE SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN. BETTER COORDINATE AND RESPOND MORE QUICKLY TO SITUATIONS JUST LIKE THAT AND AFTER THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE- POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS ARE DONE WE CALLAS YOU'RE GONNA DO YOU KNOW A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THAT A NUMBER OF OTHER INCIDENTS TO SEE HOW WE CAN- RESPOND MORE QUICKLY AND AGGRESSIVELY WHEN WE- KARISA TUITION SUCH AS THE WHITE FOSTER FARMS. I APPRECIATE THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU TO DISCUSS YOUR PARTICULAR CASE THAT WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE THE FOCUS OF MY QUESTION AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU WERE OTHERS COULD RESPOND IS- WHAT ARE THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS WHAT KINDS OF- OF PENALTIES WHAT KIND OF INCENTIVES FINANCIAL INCENTIVES IF YOU WILL. OUR IT YES IN ORDER TO GET THAT EARLIER COMPLIANCE- IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT COMPANIES RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A COST A DOLLAR AND CENTS COST TO THIS CURRENT BEHAVIOR DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY AND IF SO HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE FINES AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT OR IF YOU THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN GETTING COMPLIANCE- TO HAVE. MORE STRINGENT ORIGIN TO OF. LAWSUITS AND PENALTIES. THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AVAILABLE TO PLAINTIFFS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE BEEN HARMED I'M LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOUR INCENTIVES ARE WITCHER- AUTHORITY IS ERIN AND IF IT IS EXPANSIVE ENOUGH. AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU ALREADY HAVE OR NEED TO CREATE. MORE ACCESS TO THE COURTS FOR JUSTICE IF YOU WILL BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED. WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE OF FINE WHEN WE IDENTIFY A VIOLATION THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO THE SIZE OF THE PENALTY THE MONETARY SIDE OF THE PENALTY SO THAT LOOKS SET TO YOU KNOW NEGLIGENCE THE SIZE OF THE COMPANY. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A REPEAT OFFENDER HOW SERIOUS THE VIOLATION IS- AND WHETHER OR NOT. A VIOLATION WAS A WAS WILLFUL WHETHER OR NOT THE VIOLATION WAS ACCIDENT RELATED THOSE ARE ALL OF FRIDAY OF FACTORS THAT ARE THAT ARE CONTAINED IN OUR- I REGULATION- I BELIEVE THAT IS. THAT IT ON AN OVERALL BASIS YOUR PROVIDES- STRONG DETERRENTS THERE'S THIS YOU KNOW THIS SOME OF THE STRONGEST IN THE COUNTRY- HOWEVER THERE ARE THEY ARE NOT- YEAH THERE. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A LONG CRITICISM OF- OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ALL THESE. OUR SYSTEM MASON WIDE WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW FOR SOME CASES AGAINST VERY LARGE COMPANIES THEY ARE- THEY PALE IN COMPARISON TO FOR EXAMPLE PENALTIES- BY THE EPA OR HER OTHER KIND OF ENFORCEMENT. MECHANISMS I HAVE NOT REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH UP- YOU KNOW HOW TO DO WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING DIFFERENTLY- BUT I CAN MAKE THAT OBSERVATION- IN TERMS OF OUR AUTHORITY WE HAVE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE- IMMINENT HAZARD. ORDERS PROHIBITING USES AYE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SPECIAL ORDERS WHICH IS. AN ORDER FOR A COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH A SENSE OF STANDARDS THAT WE SET OUT THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THAT WORK PLACE SO IF THERE IS NOT A- HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARD ON THE BOOKS THAT'S APPLICABLES SITUATION WE IDENTIFY. WE CAN ISSUE A SPECIAL ORDER- AND YOUR THOSE TOOLS ARE PRESENT FAILED TO US AND- AND I BELIEVE CAN CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF PROPTHE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I HAVE. I HAVE. I STUDIED AND I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAINLY ALWAYS SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED IF THEYARE LIMITED TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THEIR- IT'S THEIR OF THEIR- GET IT OUT. RIGHTS FAITH BUT THAT'S REALLY S. I'M NOT REALLY QUALIFIED TO OPINE ON THAT- AND I THINK THAT. IT'S FOR THE BROADER DOES BUT IT'S WORTH A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT PRIVATE AG ACTIONS ON SPECIFIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES- YOU KNOW I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT CONSISTENCY WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WE DO VERSUS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN AND IN PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION BUT THERE'S ALSO. SOME POSITIVES TO AS WELL SO YOU KNOW WE WELCOME A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS THAT'S A QUITE WHICH I'M TALKING ABOUT APPRECIATE THAT LET ME GET TO MY LAST QUESTION I'VE GOT SEVERAL OF THE- I'LL JUST STOP THE NEXT ONE. YOU KNOW WE ARE- SIX MONTHS INTO THIS A LOT OF THE- KNOWLEDGE- THAT WE ASSUMED AT THE BEGINNING HAS BEEN- SORT OF CHANGED I THINK WE'RE MORE A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED LITTLE MORE IN WHAT WE KNOW AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS MARCIN I'M WONDERING NOW THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. I AND ARE GETTING INTO THE COLDER SEASON WHERE BEING INSIDE OR WE KNOW BEING OUTSIDE SEEMS TO HAVE SOME POSITIVE IMPACT THE PEOPLE ARE AGAIN MOVING BACK INSIDE WE HAVE A FLU EPIDEMIC COMING WHAT IS BEING DONE. TO ADDRESS HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS CODE SITUATION WHEN COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT THE FLU SEASON IS UPON US OUR EFFORTS BEING MADE TO ENCOURAGE OR TO PROVIDE FOR EXAMPLE SLINGSHOTS- FOR WORKERS PARTICULARLY IN A CENTRAL- INDUSTRIES WHEN YOU LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE SYMPTOMS ARE CODE MANY OF THEM ARE SIMILAR TO THE SYMPTOMS OF THE COMMON COLD- SO ARE WE ANTICIPATING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING MORE TESTING ARE WE ANTICIPATING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE IN NEED. OF FOR ACCESS TO BLUE CHANSEN ARE THOSE BEING MADE AVAILABLE SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS MORE FOR- DOES KNOW. THE ACTUAL PUBLIC HEALTH ARENA CDPH AND ALL WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE. FOR THIS UPCOMING FLU SEASON GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT THE TRANSMITTAL OF THIS VIRUS IT'S IMPACTS. AND THAT AT INTO WITH THAT DEMO THINK THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE IT OFF. POSSIBILE WE THE FLU COME. THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I'M WE HAVE. LONG THAT WE YOU ADD FLUS ON TOP OF CODE SYMPTOMS IT WILL COMPLICATE THINGS GREATLY- AND- YOU KNOW INCREASE THE DEMANDS OF PROTESTING SORTING OUT WHO WHAT WEAR DISEASE THAT PERSON REALLY HOUSE AND ALL OF THAT. ON OUR IMMUNIZATION BRANCH HAS BEEN WORKING. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS ALREADY- WITH US THE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH BRANCH WITH SOME CDC FLU EXTRA FLU FLU GRANT MONEY TO OUR ROLL OUT OF OUR REACH CAMPAIGN AND- I WORK WITH. ON THE GROUND THEY THEY EARLY ON RECOGNIZE THAT GETTING FLU SHOTS- AVAILABLE AND PROMOTED TO THOSE IN THE ESSENTIAL WORKER JOBS IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL AND SO THEY HAVE BEEN WERE ON ESTABLISHED THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. COME UP WITH A- WORKING WITH- OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL WHO IMPLEMENT MUCH OF THE FLU FLU VACCINATION I'M AT ALL OF THIS WILL SERVICE WELL FOR PLANNING FOR EVENTUAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE COLORED BACKS NATION AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME. WORKER GROUPS WHO ARE GOING TO BE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE OF FOR THOSE VACCINATIONS ON. THE TESTING FRONT. WE ARE ALSO ON IN AS FAST CHANGING SITUATION WHERE THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW TASKS APID TESTS IT IS ALL DONE DEVELOPING. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THEIR VERY CLOSELY- STARTING TO- DETERMINE WHERE INCREASED TESTING FOR SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES IN CERTAIN WORKER POPULATIONS WILL BE WARRANTED AND- AND YOU KNOW. WORKING OUT HOW THESE THESE NEWER TESTS AS THEY GET APPROVED BY THE FDA CAN BE USED MORE IN WORKPLACES FOR- RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF OUTBREAKS AND PROBLEMS SO THAT WE CAN JUMP ON THEM EARLIER. AND I HAVE SOMETHING AS WELL AS BETTER JACKSON AYE. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW ACTIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING- WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF COORDINATION HAPPENING BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF STATE AGENCIES IN TERMS OF PUBLIC AWARENESS AND MEDIA CAMPAIGNS- YOU KNOW WE WORK WITH CDPH EXTENSIVELY- AS WELL AS LABOR AGENCY- CDSS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND- I HAD THE FLU IS VERY MUCH ABOUT SOMETHING THAT. WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT AS A PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION ACROSS ALL OF OUR AGENCIES WILL BE INCORPORATING THAT MESSAGE WITH EXISTING MEDIA AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. AND LET ME ASK POINT A FOLLOW UP IF I MAY- THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT. WHETHER GETTING THE FLU MAKES YOU MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLD IT- WHETHER IT EXACERBATES IT WHETHER IT PRECLUDES IT DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT THE IMPACT COULD BE A PEOPLE- AGAIN HAVING THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS- IN ANYWAY MARGINALIZED OR COMPROMISED. BY ONE OR THE OTHER- DISEASES AND IF SO- HAVE WE TAKEN STEPS- IN OUR HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN PREPARATION FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE HAVING SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND BEING ADMITTED TO HOSPITALS AND SO FORTH. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON I THINK THAT WOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS OUR CD PH A DOCTOR MATERNA ARE DOCTOR JACOBSON. I CAN I CAN- STARTED OUT IN THIS COUNTRY HAS ANYTHING TO ADD. PREPARING FOR FLU SEASON IS IT IN OUR HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IS SOMETHING THAT IS. ALWAYS ALWAYS UNDER WAY AT THIS TIME IN THE YEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT AN IMPACT IT CAN HAVE AND- FOR A COMBINED FLUE PIPE PLUS COATED. SITUATION OUR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE WHICH OVERSEES ALL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF- MEDICAL AND HEALTH SUPPLIES AND ALSO ON. THE EFFORT TO IT TO. ENGAGE IN WHAT THEY CALL SURGE PLANNING ON IS ACTIVELY WORKING ON THIS IT'S NOT AN AREA I'M AS FAMILIAR WITH- YOU KNOW MY ROLE WITHIN PAGE BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY PLANNING THERE IS DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THE METRICS TO. IDENTIFY EARLY ON WHETHER THE INCREASED IN ILLNESSES FROM EITHER CALL IT OR FLU IS IMPACTING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT THAT- WE WILL BE ON TOP OF. OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE MANY MORE BUT I'M GOING TO SEE TO MY NEXT CALLING THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR EFFORTS THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON YES WE HAVE. ONE TWO THREE FOUR MORE CENTERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK SOLVE- PASS IT ON TO SENATOR MITCHELL AND WE OF COURSE HAVE OUR NEXT PANEL OF. WAITING FOR US SO THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT- SENATOR JACKSON LIKE I HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN HER FLU SHOTS WE CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE SENATE JACKSON. DR JON SHAKING HIS HAND SO I'VE GOT MINE ALREADY. ME TOO. GREAT EXCELLENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST VERY QUICKLY AS I LISTEN TO THE QUESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUES AS I LISTEN TO- I THINK WITH ANDREW JACKSON THAT RAISED THE TRAGIC EXPERIENCE WITH REGARD TO FOSTER FARMS THAT THINKING ABOUT A MANUFACTURING COMPANY IN MY OWN DISTRICT. I'D LIKE TO KNOW. ULTIMATELY WHAT STATE AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR INFORMING WORKERS REGARDING THEIR RIGHTS YOU KNOW- COLD ED AND WORKPLACE SAFETY WORKPLACE SAFETY EXPECTATIONS RUN COVERT ART ARE NEW AND SO WHO HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO AND WHO THEY- GO TO IF THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE HAPPENING IN THE WORKPLACE. I CAN I CAN TRY TO ANSWER START TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT D. A. R. PLAYS A LARGE ROLE IN THAT- BUT- IT REALLY IS- A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN MULTIPLE AGENCIES DEPENDING ON THEIR JURISDICTION- WE HAVE IT KELLER SAID. YOU KNOW WHO HAS A- INCLUDES IN ALL OF THEIR MESSAGING AROUND WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY- MESSAGING AROUND EMPLOYEE RIGHT CENTER AND DIRECTING THEM TO MORE INFORMATION ON- VARIOUS AREAS OF WORKERS RIGHT WE ALSO HAVE. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WITHIN THE I. R. THAT IS WHOSE PRIMARY ROLE IS TO HAVE BY SUPPORT WORKERS AND HOT AND REPRESENTS THEM ON ON VARIOUS ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED TO THE- LABOR COMMISSIONER- THERE'S RETALIATION UNITS- THERE'S ENFORCEMENT UNIT WAGE CLAIM ADJUDICATION SO WE HAVE- A NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS THAT THEY SUPPORT UNDER THE LABOR CODE- SO WE HAVE. AGREES ROLES AND TIED TO SPECIFIC JURISDICTION- BUT FROM MY VANTAGE POINT- LOOKING ACROSS THE STATE- YOU KNOW EACH STATE AGENCY- HAS A ROLE IN THIS AS WELL DEPENDING ON THEIR OWN JURISDICTION- THE END OF CV PH. ALSO WANTS TO COMMENT ON THAT. I'LL JUST ADD THE YEAH ALL OF THE GUIDE THE WE'RE PUTTING OUT THERE PUTTING UP ON OUR WAY. ENSURING THAT WORKERS ARE INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS IT IS BEING HIGHLIGHTED ON IN THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS WHERE WE LIST OUT ALL THE- TRAINING- THAT WORKERS HAVE TO DO. ABOUT THE PLAYERS HAVE TO DO IT ALSO INCLUDES- SOME OF THE NEW RIGHTS UNDER THE COLLUDED- FEDERAL LEGISLATION- FOR AND STATE LEGISLATION THAT COVERS SICK LEAVE AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. HAVING WORKERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE IF THEY'RE IF THEY ARE TO GET SICK IS REALLY CRITICAL IN THIS. BATTLE AGAINST COATED. SO I YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WE ALSO HAVE VARIOUS WAYS HOTLINES THAT WORKERS CALL INTO AND THAT SORT OF THING SO WE- DO TRY TO GIVE OUT CONSISTENT MESSAGES AND PLACES TO GO- TO. FILE COMPLAINTS WITH THE APPROPRIATE- AND TWO TEAMS WHEN- THEY FEEL THEIR RIGHTS AREN'T BEING ADDRESSED. IN IN VERY QUICKLY- I THINK I ANTICIPATED THAT ANSWER IT'S AND IT LEADS TO A PART OF MY CONCERN IN TERMS OF BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY TOUCH POINTS I HOPE THAT WORKERS DON'T DIDN'T GET LOST KIND OF IN THE SHUFFLE IF YOU WILL. LAST QUESTION ON WHICH SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE TO ANYONE COMING FROM THE CHAIR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. DO YOU THREE AGENCIES FEEL THAT YOU ARE APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE. GIVEN THE NEW INTENSITY OF THE RELEVANCE OF YOUR WORK PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO CALL OF IT EITHER IN THE- WORKER. EDUCATION ELEMENT THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT IN EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR WORK DO YOU FEEL YOUR PROPERLY RESOURCE. I'LL START TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION- I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS- MY GRATITUDE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR. PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN- BOTH STAFFING AND THE IN FUNDING- I STARTED A D. I. R. AT THE TAIL END OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND- AND- AT THE I GUESS THE BEGINNING OF THE BUDGET CRISIS AND- WAS CONCERNED THAT. WE WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES IN RESOURCES BUT IN FACT- YOU KNOW THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS THAT THE DEPARTMENT PUT FLOORS WERE. REWARDED AND WE ARE I'M IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING- THE- THE RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE- WE WERE GIVEN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR OUTREACH- OF THE LABOR AGENCY ACTUALLY WHICH THE I. R. AS A PART OF. BOB WAS GIVEN UP SIGNIFICANT OUTREACH FUNDING WHICH WILL BE HE AS WE MOVE FORWARD- AND I WE ARE IN THE PROCESS NOW OF PUTTING FORWARD- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS TIED TO. ALL OF THE BILLS THAT WERE RECENTLY SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR- THAT RELATE TO OUR JURISDICTION AT AT THE I. R. THANK YOU. KIM IS TAKEN AND THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL FOR THE QUESTIONS- NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO WE JUST GONNA DO A LITTLE BIT OF A LIGHTNING ROUND HERE FOR OUR US SENATORS BUT THE NEXT SENATORS CENTER TO RUSSELL THANK YOU. I THINK ONE OF OUR PANELISTS JUST O GIVE YOU SOME pSECOND PANEL HAS TO LEAVE AT THREE. THREE O'CLOCK. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR. THE LATINO CAUCUS HAS- ENGAGED A LOT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE DISPROPORTIONAL- SPREADING OF THE VIRUS HAS BEEN IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY BY TWENTY YOU KNOW 1520% ABOVE THE POPULATION- AND I JUST SO THIS IS OF GRAVE CONCERN THE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORKPLACE WHERE THERE IS- AND INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS THAT ARE ENORMOUS THE ENORMOUSLY IMPACTED BUT WE ONLY HAVE HEARD OF A FEW CASES. THEN THOSE MEN AND WOMEN GO HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES WHERE BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW WAGES- FACE OVERCROWDED NURSE- AND ARE UNABLE IN THAT SITUATION TO DO THE SOCIAL DISTANCING SO THERE IS A- APPEARS TO BE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE STUDY BUT IT APPEARS TO BE A VERY DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN WORKPLACE ENFORCEMENT. AND BEING ABLE TO STOP THE SPREAD IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITIES- SO. YOU MENTIONED. MISTER PARKER ABOUT THE REPORTING. THE REPORTING BY EMPLOYERS AND IF THERE WAS TRUE FREEDOM TO REPORT BY EMPLOYEES- AND THAT TRUE FREEDOM TO ENFORCE THE RIGHTS THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVE ON PAPER- THEN THE NUMBERS OF THESE CASES THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE CASES WE PROBABLY WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER YOU YOU SEEMED A LITTLE SKEPTICAL AS TO THE NUMBERS OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED- IN YOUR OPINION SO AND I'M GLAD- MISTAKEN- MENTIONED THE ADDITIONAL- FUNDING THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE TO DO WORKPLACE EDUCATION AND WORKER ENFORCEMENT SO. I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT CAN YOU JUST- MAYBE MISS MISS HAGEN OR MISTER PARKER DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS WHATSOEVER ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO INTENSIFY THE ENFORCEMENT ASPECT OF- OF REPORTING AND DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE- THIS IS THIS IS MANY MANY LIVES LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN AT STAKE MANY MANY DEATHS AND THEY'RE SPREADING IN OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE GOT TO TAKE THIS AS MUCH MORE THAN A CRISIS THIS IS A DOUBLE TRIPLE CRISIS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY SO. ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO TO REALLY UP THE ANTE HERE WHICH IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THANK YOU I CAN SPEAK TO OUR RESPECT MAYBE- G. PARKER IF I COULD ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO ENFORCEMENT INITIALLY. START ON TIME WELL FOR I'D SAY THAT I'M A HUGE. IN THE IN OF EMPLOYEE. UNEMPLOYED VOICE IN THE WORKPLACE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES WHEN THEY ARE IN FACT YOU KNOW THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEIR- THE MOST AT STAKE BY FAR WHEN IT COMES TO- SOMEONE GETTING INJURED OR KILLED ARE SAFE ON THE JOB. AND SO- NO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I. DEFINITELY WANT TO DO IN MY TIME HERE IS TO EXPLORE HOW WE CAN. YOU KNOW EXPAND THOSE- CONNECTIONS OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYEES TO SPEAK UP. A WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF- INTENSIFICATION OF. OF ENFORCEMENT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE. TRIED TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON- INDUSTRIES WHERE THERE ARE LOW WAGE IMMIGRANT WORKERS ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IS THAT. WE OFTEN. DON'T GET GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE WORKPLACES FOR THE VERY REASONS THAT YOU DESCRIBED- FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT MORE INSPECTIONS IN AGRICULTURE. THEN WE'VE RECEIVED COMPLAINTS WHICH S AN INDICATOR OF THE PROBLEM. AND SO- THAT'S AN ISSUE WE'RE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT BUT I THINK WE'VE- NO IDENTIFIED THERE IS A PROBLEM WHEN EXPAND THAT- EXPAND THOSE EFFORTS. THANK YOU MISTER PARKER SENATOR GRASSO DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER FOLLOW UP. I DO BUT I KNOW YOU'RE PRESSED FOR TIME SO MAYBE AT THE END I COULD- ADD SOME MORE YES WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DO THAT- AND I WILL MOVE THEN TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR DODD. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SPEAKERS- AND THEIR INFORMATION THEY GIVE US TODAY AS A FORMER- EMPLOYEE YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL SAY STRAIGHT UP- THE EMPLOYEES HAVE TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND- I APPRECIATE THE NEW ENFORCEMENT THINGS ARE GOING ON. IN THAT REGARD BUT I THINK IT'S THEIR NEIGHBOR AND FRANKLY I HAVE NO ROOM FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE NEGLIGENT OR DO NOT COOPERATE- WITH EITHER COUNTY STATE COUNTY OR STATE. OFFICIALS BUT THAT SAID I JUST KIND OF INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT LOOK AT THIS IS A NEW. THIS EVERYTHING COULD NOT BE SOLVED PARTICULARLY WHEN WORD A PANDEMIC THAT WE'VE NEVER GONE THROUGH THE PUBLIC NEVER GONE THROUGH THIS BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT'S NEVER GOT WILL BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT'S NEVER GOT THROUGH THIS CERTAINLY STAND IN RECENT RECENT TYPES SO WE DON'T THIS IS NOT LIKE AN INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT THAT YOU'RE GOING OUT. AND INVESTIGATING IN MY VIEW YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE TESTING YOUR TESTING SITUATIONS WHAT WE HAVE TSTING BUT NO WE DON'T HAVE IT FOR THESE SITUATIONS. YEAH AND THIS REALLY WENT ON THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AS WELL MA'AM WE HAVE TESTING AND WE HAVE TESTING TURN AROUND SIR CHIU IN THREE OR. FOUR WEEKS LONG CURRENT LAWS THAT. HAVE BEEN IN. BETWEEN AND STATE CERTAINLY. A FEDERAL BIG I ONLY THEY GOT IT. IN YOU KNOW SO I REALLY CONCERNED THAT. EASY TO TAKE MIGHT BE SAY OKAY LET'S DOA PRIOR PROPRIETOR RIGHT ACTIONS OF THESE TYPE THINGS BUT- THE REALITY IS- YOU KNOW. WHAT IS LOOKED AT YOU IN THIS THE SITUATION SEN YOUR FRANKLY FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT TO GET THOSE THAT ARE NOT DOING THE JOB AND AB NEGLIGENCE. NO ROOM FOR THAT BUT I IDEA I D. JUST HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT- EMPLOYERS. JUST ACROSS THE BORDER JUST ABUSING THEIR EMPLOYEES THE SITUATION BASED ON WHAT I'VE SEEN OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN BUSINESS AND TWENTY YEARS OF PUBLIC. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD INDEED YOU HAVE- WAS OUR QUESTION DIRECTED TO A SPECIFIC PANELIST. WELL I JUST THINK SOMEBODY LOGIN TO YOUR SKIN MISTER PARKER YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S A NEW YEAR YOU NEED AND YOU GOT TO BE LOOKING AT THOSE TYPE OF THINGS TO. OF COURSE YEAH SO- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR. THERE WAS THERE'S BEEN A PROGRESS A PROGRESSION OF OUR ACTIVITY. YOU KNOW WE REALLY STARTED WITH EDUCATING EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS WE PUT OUT ALL THAT A GUIDANCE INFORMATION. WE DID A LOT OF OUTREACH TO EDUCATE- EMPLOYERS TO ADDRESS THIS FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS QUESTION THAT YOU- THAT YOU ASK. YEAH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER WE HAD EMPLOYERS COMING TO US. SAYING TELL US EXACTLY WHAT TO DO WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE. EXACTLY AND SO WE ENDEAVOR TO DO THAT- WE'VE DONE A LOT OF COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE FOR THAT VERY REASON YOU KNOW WE'VE KNOCKED ON THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOORS TO OFFER MY ASSISTANCE TO EMPLOYERS. AND I'LL ALSO ADD THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS BY. A LETTER INVESTIGATION- IN MOST CASES UNLESS IT'S VERY SERIOUS. WELL WE GIVE THEM THE OPTION ANY OF RESPONDING TO THE- TO THE TO THE QUESTIONS AND IT JUST SO WE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER A CONDUCTOR COULD ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION. OR THEY CAN CHOOSE COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE IF THEY HAVE OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE I GUESS THE RIGHT WORDS CONSULTATION. AND IN OUR VERNACULAR THAT THEY CAN SEE COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE SHOCKINGLY FEW- TAKE THAT OPTION MOST OF THEM. RESPOND TO THAT- YOU TAKE THE AVENUE THAT RESULTS. IN THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. BUT WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT THE- KIND PROGRESSION OF HOW WE I'M TAKEN ON THIS ISSUE. I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR DODD AND WE HAVE SENATOR UMBERG NEXT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A TWO QUESTIONS- I BELIEVE TO A DOCUMENT TURNOUT CONCERNING TESTING ONE IF WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE. ADDITIONAL TESTING IN THE WORKPLACE TO INCREASE ITS STATE WHAT'S ARE TESTING CAPACITY NUMBER ONE AND THEN NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF THE TURNAROUND TIME BETWEEN- THE TIME THE TEST AND THE TIME OF THE RESULTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER QUARANTINING OR ISOLATIONIST IS NECESSARY. THANK YOU I THINK BOUNCE THAT CAMPING JACOBSON IF SHE'S STILL ON. YES DR JACOBSON. YEAH HI- THANK YOU SENATOR I'M BURNED I'M DOCTOR JACOBSON FROM THE TESTING TASK FORCE AND YOUR FIRST QUESTION WAS- WHAT'S ARE TESTING CAPACITY AND- FOR CALIFORNIA CAPACITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED. THOUSAND TELL US THE DATE AND WE NEARLY REACH THAT CAPACITY I ONCE OR TWICE AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND TESTS PER DAY- HOWEVER I CALIFORNIA IS. DEVELOPING AND PREPARING TO OPEN ITS OWN STATE LOUD AND- THAT'S BEING DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH PERKINELMER AND THAT LAB IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER. AT ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL TESTS PER DAY WITH THE ABILITY TO EXPAND UP TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL TESTS PER DAY- AND WOULD BE. EXPECTATION THAT THAT EXPANSION OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TONS PER DAY. WILL OCCUR BY MARCH AND NICK YEAR. HI IN. COLLABORATION WITH THAT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT TO THAT IS- BEING REVIEWED AT THIS TIME THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES LOOKING AT CREATIVE MEANS FOR- SPECIMEN COLLECTION. THAT WILL THEN BE SENT TO THAT LAB IN THOSE CREATIVE MEANS ARE TO ENSURE THAT WE- CAN REACH AN ACCESS. I SEE INDIVIDUALS MOST AT NEED FOR TESTING. THAT WAS YOUR FIRST QUESTION. I MEAN JUST ASK QUICK FOLLOW ON TO THAT QUESTION. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NEED IS DO YOU HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE EMPLOYER NEEDS WOULD BE AND THEN WHEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THAT NEED. THERE ARE GREAT SO. THE TESTING TASK FORCE HAS BEEN. WORKING AND WE'RE REALLY IN THE FINAL STAGE. OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE BASED ON STRATEGIC TESTING CLAMP. LOOKING AT OUR TESTING FREQUENCY ON VARIOUS WORKER CO COURTS AND THEN ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF BOTH PCR TESTING. AND IMAGING TESTING THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO MEET. ME AND I. TIMING AS TO WHEN WE WILL. LIKELY MEET THAT NEED. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WILL. IT BECAUSE THAT WOULD NEED TO BE SOME GUIDANCE IS WRITTEN TO. NEED TO THAT OUR STRATEGIC PLAN. ONCE IT'S APPROVED I THINK THAT ONCE THE PERKINELMER LAB OPENS UP WERE WILL ALREADY BE IN PRETTY GOOD POSITION TO MEET MOST OF THE NEEDS I'D SAY ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW SOMEONE AROUND 75% OF THE NEEDS COME NOVEMBER ONE ONCE WE EXPAND TO. THE FULL CAPACITY OF THE LAB WILL EXCEED THE PCR NEEDS. IN ADDITION TO THAT ARE JUST THIS WEEK HI WE BEGAN TO RECEIVE. SOME OF THE NEW ANTIGEN TESTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S ANTICIPATING RECEIVING. ON A PER CAPITA BASIS EIGHT PERCENTAGE PROXIMATE LI 10% OF A HUNDRED MILLION TASKS- BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF DECEMBER- IMAGING TESTS AND THERE'S AN ENGINE TESTS ARE BEST USED FOR SYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS. WITHIN A WEEK OF SYMPTOM ONSET SO WE'RE ALSO ACCOUNTING FOR WEARING WINDOWS TEST WOULDBE USED WITHIN THAT TOTAL- ESTIMATES OF. AN ENGINE IN PCR TESTING. IF YOU'RE I HAVE WELL I AS SOME BE TO DO FORM THERE'S NO QUESTION WAS IN TERMS TURN AROUND TIME WITH HITS SUCH LENGTHY TURNAROUND TIMES IT OFTEN THAT THE TESTS AREN'T THAT USEFUL IN TERMS OF KEEPING THE WORK. SAFE JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY. UPDATE ON THAT. YEAH IS IT AND JUST TO SORT OF BACK UP SOME OF THAT. I LONG TURNAROUND TIME THAT WAS HAPPENING IN JULY I WAS THE RESULT I WAS- BASICALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCREASED DEMAND FOR TESTING AND A LOT OF THE TESTS BEING- SENT TO THE SAME FEW LABS ACROSS THE COUNTRY'S OF THOSE LARGE LABS WERE EXCEEDING THEIR CAPACITY. BY FORTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND JUST A DAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND SO THAT WAS PLAYING INTO SOME OF THOSE FOR A LONG TURNAROUND TIMES BUT THE TESTING TASK FORCE HAS IMPLEMENTED THE METRIC FOR TRACKING TURNAROUND TIME. AND DEVELOP THE DASHBOARD AND I CAN TELL YOU FOR THE LAST WEEK- IN 92% OF OUR TESTS HAVE A TURNAROUND TIME OF LESS THAN TWO DAYS IN SIXTY NINE PERCENT. IN LESS THAN ONE DAY- AND THAT'S BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS NOW. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DOCTOR JACOBSON CENTER- BURKE PRESHEAF THAT AND SO- I HAVE A QUESTION I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE END BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO GET INTO OUR SECOND PANEL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HEAR THE VOICES OF OUR WORKERS- BUT JUST TO PUT A PIN IN AND WHAT I WAS GOING TO MENTION WAS THE SPECIFICS ON INVESTIGATION PERIOD- I JUST WOULD LIKE TO. TO KNOW THAT AS TO WHEN IT STARTS AND WHEN IT ENDS AND ALL THE DETAILS IN BETWEEN SO WITH THAT SAID WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL. AND THE WITNESSES HERE HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED ABOUT FOUR MINUTES EACH FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS OUR FIRST PRESENTER IN OUR AND OUR FINAL PANEL IS AMBER BAUER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE U. OF C. W. UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS FOR WESTERN STATES COUNCIL WELCOME IS BARREN THANK YOU. FOR JOINING US AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU SO FOR HAVE ME I AM AMBER BALLARD. DIRECTOR FOR YOU. STUDENT WORKERS WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. I JUST WHEN I THINK THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. DISCUSSES VERY IMPORTANT AND INCREDIBLY TIMELY TOPIC OF WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING THE CALL THE NINETEENTH HAD DONE THAT- AND JUST THANK YOU TO THE ENTIRE PANEL- THAT JUST WENT BEFORE. BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER WITH DIRECTOR HAGEN CHIEF PARKER. AND CDPH DR MATERNA WHO HAS REALLY BEEN TIRELESSLY WORKING TO PROTECT WORKERS DURING THIS VERY UNPRECEDENTED- PANDEMIC- I REALLY ALSO WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT THAT AND APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION OUTLINING THE VAST CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE ALL FACING. IN PARTICULAR TO THE DISCUSSION AROUND EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE WHICH UFCW SPONSORED AND WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL. TO OUR WORK AND PROTECTING WORKERS FROM WORKPLACE ILLNESS- INCLUDING KOBE NINETEEN. WE REPRESENT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA- NEARLY EVERY POINT IN THE FOOD CHAIN. MANY OF THE SECTORS MOST IMPACTED BY CURRENT NINETEEN ARE AREAS WE REPRESENT WORKERS INCLUDING GROCERY STORES MEAT PACKING FOOD PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE. HEALTH CARE. AND FOOD DELIVERY DRIVERS. I'M WE ALL KNOW THE ISSUE ARE HERE AND THEY WERE DETAILED VERY CLEARLY IN THE QUESTIONS FROM THE SENATORS WORKERS ARE FACING A HEALTH AND SAFETY CRISIS THAT IS COSTING THEM THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES. THESE ARE WORKERS TO KEEP OUR GROCERY SHELVES STOCKED THEY GROW AND PROCESS OUR FOOD AND THEY KEEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING. ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND OUR MEMBERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COULD NINETEEN OUTBREAKS. AND ARE IN COMMUNITIES LATINO BLACK IMMIGRANT WOMEN IN LOW WAGE WORKERS. THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT NEIL WORKERS LACK POWER IN THE WORKPLACE. OFF THE BOARD THEY LACK SUFFICIENT POWER TO BE ABLE TO ASSERT AND ENFORCE THE RIGHT. THIS IS HARD EVEN AT UNION WORK SITE BUT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE A NONUNION WORKPLACE. PLACES WE'VE SEEN THIS FIRST HAND IN EVERY SECTOR AND NOTABLY IN MEAT PACKING WHICH WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER. WORKERS RIGHTS ARE NOT MEANINGFUL IF THEY CANNOT BE ENFORCED. THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE SEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COULD NINETEEN CRISIS- WE'VE HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES OF EMPLOYERS NOT FOLLOWING PROTOCOL EMPLOYERS NOT NOTIFYING WORKERS OF WORK PLACE EXPOSURE WORK WORKERS NOT BEING TOLD ABOUT THEIR SICK LEAVE RATES EMPLOYERS NOT ENFORCING DISTANCING. STANDARDS WORKERS NOT HAVING PP PROPER VENTILATION OR IN DURING CROWDED AREAS LIKE THE TIME CLOCK WHEN THEY PENSION OR BREAK ROOMS AND A REMINDER THAT WE ARE NOT SET UP TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE MANY OF THESE. REQUIREMENTS SO WE HAD TO RESPOND AND THINK AND COLUSA FOR REALLY GETTING GUIDANCE OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY BUT WE HAVE TO REALLY ENFORCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LIKE- AT A HOSPITALOR SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THE YOU ARE USED TO EXPOSURE. THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT AND THERE HAS BEEN SLOW AND FORCE MET WORKERS NEED EDUCATION ON THEIR RIGHTS IN THE WORKPLACE AND HOW TO BRING FORWARD A COMPLAINT. YOU NEED TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTS REPORT VIOLATIONS TO CALIFORNIA THE CHALLENGE HERE AND IT'S I THINK THAT FOR MANY REASONS AS DOUG MENTIONED BUT IT THE PROCESS TAKES SO LONG SO WE HAVE WORKERS REPORTING WORK. WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS IN ISSUES BUT IT HAS TAKEN MONTHS. I THINK I'M AN ISSUE THAT WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT- FROM SENATOR DRAW ALSO IS RETALIATION. WORKPLACE PROBLEMS ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE THREAT OF RETALIATION AGAINST WORKERS WHO SPEAK OUT. WHICH HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON WORKERS SPEAKING UP. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE ENFORCEMENT IT'S REALLY COMPLAINT DRIVEN RATHER THAN TARGETED AND BASED ON RISK FOR VIOLATIONS. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS AT ONE OF OUR STORES ITS STORE BY STORE COMPLAINT DRIVEN INSTAD OF- AN ISSUE THAT WE MAY SEE FOR AN ENTIRE FOR AN EMPLOYER IN THE STATE. SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED AND ARE WORKING AND TO PROMOTE IS REALLY EMPOWERING WORKERS THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THEM IS TO EMPOWER THEM. THE NEW A TO KNOW THERE WORK THEY KNOW THEIR WORKPLACES BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE THEIR ON SITEDALY THERE IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY AND STOP UNSAFE WORK CONDITIONS. THEY CAN REPRT CASES AND DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE WORKPLACE AND THE INDUSTRY TO PROTECT WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC. WE NEED POLICIES THAT INCREASE WORKERS ROLE IN THE WORKPLACE WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT SUPPORT WORKERS TAKING ON AN ACTIVE ROLE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY AT THE WORKPLACE. AND THIS REALLY COMES THROUGH ORGAN ORGANIZING. WE ALSO NEED A RAPID AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE EXISTING LAWS. WE NEED RAPID ENFORCEMENT FROM KELLER SAID TO CONTAIN OUTBREAKS AND PROTECT WORKERS WE NEED IN PERSON INSPECTIONS TO SHOW EMPLOYERS COMPLIANCE IS IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO INCREASE PENALTIES TO CREATE TRUE DETERRENT FOR BOTH VIOLATED HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS RETALIATION AGAINST WORKERS WHO SPEAK UP. RAPID RESPONSE TEAMS WHO EVEN OUR WE'LL JUST HAVE YOU WRAP UP IF YOU DON'T MIND THANK YOU- SHOULD WRAP IT IN FOR AND RAPID RESPONSE THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT TARGETED ENFORCEMENT BASED ON SIX EIGHTY FIVE. AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE THERE SHOULD BE NEW POLICIES FOR WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY- STRENGTHEN ANTI RETALIATION WITH WHISTLE BLOWING AND FORCE SIX EIGHTY FIVE FORMATION OF WORKERS COUNCILS FOR WORKERS TO BE AT THE TABLE AND DESIGNING INDUSTRY SPECIFIC HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS. AND BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ANY BETTER FERNANDEZ WITH THE UNITED FARM WORKERS FOUNDATION WELCOME MR FERNANDES. THANK YOU HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M I'M A BIT OF AN AND THIS ON THE SIDE OF PALMER. AND ALSO AN ADVOCATE WITH THE UFW FOUNDATION. IT IS SAID THAT THE CRISIS HIGHLIGHTS THE BEST AND WORST IN PEOPLE AND THIS IS TRUE FOR PEOPLE. AND AS IT IS FOR LEADERS AND OUR STATE AS A WHOLE. FARMWORKERS SEE THAT KINDA MAKE AYE SHEDDING LIGHT ON A TALE OF TWO CALIFORNIA'S. THERE ARE FARMWORKERS AND THEN. THERE'S A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. CAN IS LEAD. THE LEADING AGRICULTURE STATE IN THE- AND HOME TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF FARMWORKERS. BUT BY THESE NUMBERS YOU MAY THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE IS FLOURISHING. IT IS FLOURISHING. BUT JUST NOT FOR FARMWORKERS. HERE THE FACTS. FARMWORKERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED- ENDING IN THE STATE THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR PERMANENT SICK PAY. OR FOR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. FARMWORKERS ARE NOT CONSIDERED FOR STATE HAZARD PAY DESPITE WORKING ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS JOBS IN THE COUNTRY. A FORMER FAMILY MAKES TWENTY THOUSAND TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR. AND KIDS AS YOUNG AS TWELVE YEARS OLD. COULD WORK IN THE FIELDS JUST LIKE I DID. MANY FARMWORKERS ARE PAID UNDER THE TABLE AND CHEATED OUT OF THEIR WAGES. AND THEN WE AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA TO SHUT DOWN AND START OVER WHEN THEY REFUSED TO PAY. UNDER THE FEDERAL H. TWO A. VISA PROGRAM GUEST WORKERS ARE AN INDENTURED SERVANTS AND OUR STATE'S HOUSING CODE ALLOWS FOR ERIC STAAL HOUSING JUST SUBSIDIZED THE OPPRESSION OF PEOPLE. WELL PERFORMING BACKBREAKING WORK TO FEED THE NATION FARMWORKERS ARE EXPOSED TO EXTREME HEAT DANGEROUS PESTICIDES THE RISK OF KOBE NINETEEN AND HARMFUL AIR NOW BECAUSE OF THE WILDFIRES. THE WORKING EVACUATION ZONES WITH NO MASKS IN THE NAME OF SAVING COMMODITY FROM THE FIRE WHILE MANY FACE FOOD INSECURITY AT HOME. NOW WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES AND YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF. WITH ALL THE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR FARMWORKERS. WIRE THE STILL THE FAX. AS WE SIT HERE TODAY. WHY IS THERE SUCH A DISPARITY IN POWER IN INCOME AND HEALTH COVERAGE IN WORKING CONDITIONS AND IN THE LAWS NOT THE GOVERNOR STATE'S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM. LIKE OTHER HISTORIC INJUSTICES THE SYSTEM IS NOT BROKEN. RATHER THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO KEEP FARMWORKERS FROM EVER RECEIVING THE ECONOMIC RECOGNITION THEY DESERVE. WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING FARMWORKERS NEED CHANGES IN THE EXISTING STATE PROCESS FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ELECTIONS SO THAT WOULD FARMWORKERS ORGANIZED THEY CAN LIFT THEMSELVES UP AND GO SHOOT FOR THEMSELVES THE CURRENT VOTING AND ELECTION PROCESS IS MEANT TO SUPPRESS VOTES AND THE NINE OUTCOMES ALL TO PERPETUATE THE ECONOMIC REPRESSION THAT HAS EXISTED SINCE THE DAYS OF SLAVERY. IT MUST CHANGE AND WE SHOULD BE LEADING THE TRAINS THE CHANGER. ADDITIONALLY FARMWORKERS ARE CONSISTENTLY WRITTEN OUT OF STATE LAWS THAT LEADERS THEMSELVES NEGOTIATE. WE NEED LEADERS AT PRIORITIZE HUMANS AS MUCH AS THEY PRIORITIZE COMMODITIES. THAT WOULD ALLOW WORKERS TO BE PROTECTED WHILE TAKING WINE GRAPES AND INSPIRES ARMS WILL REVIEW THE LAWS THAT THEY'RE NEGOTIATING AND ASK THEMSELVES IF THESE LAWS ARE A BENEFITS FARMWORKERS. AND WILL ALSO ENFORCE CURRENT LAWS TO ENSURE THAT THE FINES ARE. COLLECTED NOT JUST ISSUE. THE ESSENTIAL WORKER DESIGNATION DOESN'T MEAN THAT FARMWORKERS GET PROTECTIONS THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS RECEIVED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN KOBE NINETEEN LEGISLATION AND YET WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR MASKS FOR SAFE DISTANCING PRACTICES THAT WORK FOR BASIC SANITATION SUPPLIES FOR KOBE NINETEEN SCREENING AND FOR CLEAN PORTABLE BATHROOMS. WE HOPE YOU CAN JOIN US AS WE LOOK TO CHANGE THE SYSTEMIC INJUSTICES BUILT IN OUR EXISTING LAWS AND THINK AND- THINK OF US WHEN YOU WRITE THE NEXT SET OF LAWS THAT AFFECT FARMERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR FERNANDES WE APPRECIATE THAT. AND NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM NOR HUNTLEY A CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT AT A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN OAKLAND- MISS HUNTLEY. HELLO I'M GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NORMAN UNITED BEEN A CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT AT A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY FOR OVER A DECADE WHERE THE FRONTLINE CAREGIVERS WHO PROVIDED THE LION'S SHARE OF DIRECT PATIENT CARE NURSING HOMES. FROM ASSISTING WITH ALL ASPECTS OF NUTRITION AND HYGIENE TO MANAGING MEDICATIONS COMP DISEASES AND INJURY PREVENTION OUR WORK IS VERY DIFFICULT VERY PERSONAL AND VERY HANDS ON AND REQUIRES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COMPASSION AND CARE. FOR MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS WE ALONG WITH OTHER RESIDENTS OTHER STAFF OR THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY WERE SO THEY WILL SEE OR INTERACT WITH AT ALL AND THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN TRUE FOR ALL THE RESIDENTS DURING THE GOLDEN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WELL I HAVE BEEN ON MATERNITY LEAVE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AS A SHOP STEWARD I HAVE KEPT IN CONTACT WITH MY DIRECT COLLEAGUES AS AN ACTIVIST IN MY UNION SEIU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH NURSING HOME MEMBERS ACROSS THE BAY AREA IN THE ENTIRE STATE TO STAND UP FOR OUR OWN IN OUR PATIENTS RIGHTS AND OUR SAFETY. TODAY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES STORIES AND EXPERIENCES DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME WHEN SO MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS AND COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN STICKING. WORKERS IN NURSING HOMES ARE ALL. WOMEN PEOPLE OF. MANY OF THEM IMMIGRANTS. THE OUR SOCIETY VALUES US IN OUR- IS IMPORTANT PART OF FIRST. IT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO SUCH YOU DRESS AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. AT TWO OF THE FACILITIES I'M PERSONALLY CONNECTED TO MORE THAN TEN NURSING HOME WORKERS HAVE COULD. HAVE CONTRACTED CALLED IN NINETEEN. ALL OF THEM FORTUNATE ARE STILL ALIVE. BUT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF DISTRESS. YEAH SO ISOLATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES THEY HAD A LITTLE SUPPORT WHEN THEY WERE MOST AFRAID. MANY OF THEM ARE NOW REPORTING LONG TERM EFFECTS. IN THE SAME FACILITIES WORKERS REPORT REALLY PROBLEMATIC AND INCONSISTENT APPROACHES TO WORKERS AND PATIENT SAFETY. IN ONE FACILITY DEPARTMENT HAS ALWAYS HAD PP. BUT C. N. A.'S WHO DIRECTLY WORK WITH THE PATIENTS IN CHARGE NURSES HOUSEKEEPERS. FREQUENTLY WENT WITHOUT THEM. TRAINING OF HOUSEKEEPING STAFF FROM PP USE INSPECTION CONTROLS AND CONSISTENT A LONG DELAYED- ONE CALLING EVEN REPORTED THAT WORKERS WHO STARTED THEIR SHIFT IN THE MORNING AT SEVEN. WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL DEPARTMENT HEADS CAME. IN AT EIGHT OR NINE AM. TO GET PEOPLE AVAIL TO THEM. OTHER CALL REPORT THERE WERE ALL SHORTAGE OF REPEAT UNTIL THE STATE UP. AND LIKE MAGIC OKAY OF PETE. ONE OF MY UNION. FROM BEACH MARIA. BASS WORK THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM UNTIL HER. RESULTS CAME BACK POSITIVE IN JULY. SHE AND HER COLLEAGUES WORKING WITH ORDINARY SURGICAL MASK NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT THEM. SHE HER HUSBAND HER SON AND DAUGHTER IN LAW AND TO BRING KIDS ALL GOT SICK. HER HUSBAND ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR TWENTY TWO DAYS INTUBATED AND STRUGGLING TO HANG ON TO LIFE. WONDER WHY SOME CALM ARE MORE. THAN OTHERS. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THIS EXAMPLE MULTIPLE GENERATIONS WAS STRICKEN BY THE DISEASE CARRIED BY ONE UNPROTECTED FRONTLINE WORKERS. ANOTHER UNION SISTER NOBLE NICOLE MARZANO WORSEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FACILITY WHERE PP WAS RUSSIAN WERE COLD AND ON CALL. PATIENTS WERE NOT SEPARATED WILL WORKERS INCLUDING HERSELF FORSAKEN. DOES HAD SOMETHING SHE WAS TOLD TO CONTINUE COMING TO WORK JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A FEVER. MY COLLEAGUES REPORT CONFUSING CONFLICTING AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING RULES PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. OVERALL WE REPORT FEELING THAT NURSING HOM WORKERS AND RESIDENTS DON'T HAVE THE BACK WE NEED FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THROUGHOUT THE STATE ONE MANY HAVE BRAVELY SPOKEN OF ABOUT CONDITIONS FOR EACH ONE TAKES THAT RESTORED DOZENS AND MAYBE EVEN HUNDREDS WERE JUST TOO AFRAID. I KNOW BECAUSE EVEN AS A SHOPS OR WHENEVER I HAVE SPOKEN UP FOR OTHERS. I GET PUT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE GET WRITTEN UP FOR THE TINIEST THINGS IN A GENERAL SENSE A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE PUSH BACK AND PUT. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS FEEL SAFE TO SPEAK OUT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE DOES A BETTER JOB- FORCING THE STANDARDS THAT ALREADY EXIST. IN CREATING NEW ONES FOR THIS AND OTHER PANDEMICS. AND FINALLY I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE ONLY NURSING HOME WORKERS. OF SOLVING THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE. WORKERS ARE RESPECTED PAID WELL AND HAVE BENEFITS DON'T NEED TO WORK TWO OR THREE JOBS JUST TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. WE NEED GOOD JOBS AND ALSO VOICE AT WORK. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR COMMITMENTS KEEPING NURSING. HOME WORKERS IN OUR PATIENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS HUNTLEY. YOUR TESTIMONY AS WELL. OUR NEXT PRESENTER IS AMY ARE LINDY REGISTERED NURSE AT KAISER FRESNO MS ARE LENDING MADE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY ARLEN I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AT KAISER HOSPITAL IN FRESNO AS WELL AS A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION UNION. I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY FROM THE TRENCHES. I HAVE BEEN AN ICU NURSE ON NIGHT SHIFT FOR TWO DECADES AND FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS I HAVE BEEN WORKING EXCLUSIVELY IN A DESIGNATED COGAN ICU UNIT. I HAVE EARNED THESE DARK CIRCLES I'VE LEFT MY HOUSE EXACTLY TWICE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS FOR NON WORK RELATED-REASONS. I AM NOT ALONE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE STILL ISOLATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES TO KEEP THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES SAFE BECAUSE AFTER SIX MONTHS. OF THIS PANDEMIC RAGING ON WE ARE STILL NOT SAFE AT WORK. WINTER IS COMING AND WITH IT COMES THE FLU AND LET ME TELL YOU WE ARE NOT PREPARED. EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME THEIR HOSPITAL STILL PRESSURING THEIR NURSES TO REVIEWS AND NINETY FIVE MASKS DESPITE COUCHES PROHIBITION OF THIS IS ANYTHING. EXCEPT A LAST DITCH EFFORT. THEIR OWN PP WITH ARGUMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT LIKE YOU'RE SCARING THE PATIENTS AND THIS IS NOT A DESIGNATED COPING UNIT THEREFORE YOU DON'T NEED ANY ADDED PROTECTION. IT IS ON THOSE NON COATED UNITS THAT WE HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY. SURPRISED WITH POSITIVE PATIENTS AND HAD SOME. STAFF OUT. SINCE THE RECALL OF MILLION OF AB RESPIRATORS HOSPITALS ARE NOW SCRAMBLING TO FIND ALTERNATIVES ONE OF THOSE BEING B. Y. D. THEY ONLY PROVIDE MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZES SO THE NURSES WITH SMALLER FACES. WHICH ARE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PETITE THEME IN THE INTO. ARE FAILING FIT TESTING AND NOT BEING PROVIDED WITH ANY OTHER NECESSARY SAFE SUBSTITUTE. THE CONSTANT STRUGGLE ON THE FRONT LINES TO SECURE THE NECESSARY SUPPLIES WE NEED TO SAFELY DO OUR JOBS. HAS ONLY ADDED TO THE STRESS AND FRUSTRATION THAT WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH DAILY. LOSING DOZENS OF ICU PATIENTS ONE RIGHT AFTER THE OTHER MONTH AFTER MONTH. SOME OF THEM IN THEIR TWENTIES THIRTIES AND FORTIES WITH NO PRE EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS HAS TAKEN A SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL ESPECIALLY ON MYSELF. WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SUFFER THROUGH HAS CAUSED MANY FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO RETIRE MUCH EARLIER THAN THEY HAD PLANNED OR JUST TO ALTOGETHER QUIT RATHER THAN TO CONTINUE TO RISK THEIR LIVES UNNECESSARILY. THOSE OF US THAT ARE TRYING TO STICK IT OUT ARE SUFFERING FROM COLLECTIVE MORAL INJURY PTSD DEPRESSION SOCIAL ISOLATION AND THE PHYSICAL STRESS FROM THE PROLONGED EXCESSIVE WORKLOADS AND STRESS THAT WE'VE BEEN UNDER. WE'VE HAD AN INCREASING NUMBER OF SERIOUS WORKPLACE INJURIES AND MENTAL HEALTH LEAVES COUPLED WITH HEALTHCARE WORKERS OUT SICK WITH CODED IN SOME HOSPITALS LAOS DURING A PANDEMIC LEADING TO JOB IN SECURITY. MANY HOSPITALS LIKE MINE DO NOT HIRE NEW GRADS OR TRAINEE NURSES AND THERE IS NO LONG TERM PLAN TO REPLACE THOSE WORKERS AND LESS IT IS WITH TEMPORARY PER DIEM OR TRAVELER NURSES. AND WE'VE ALREADY EXHAUSTED THOSE POOLS OF RESOURCES. SOME HOSPITALS EVEN TRIED TO WAVE OUR NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS JUSTIFYING THOSE REQUESTS WITH ASSERTIONS THAT THEY WILL CLOSE DOWN THERE ARE IN CANCEL ELECTIVE SURGERIES BUT THEN DON'T DO IT. TESTING FOR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS IS STILL NOT HAPPENING SIX MONTHS INTO A PANDEMIC. I HAVE BEEN WORKING DIRECTLY WITH HOPE AND POSITIVE INTENSIVE CARE PATIENTS I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE FOSTERS FARM WORKERS I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO. THE FARMWORKERS I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE SOCIAL EVEN NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY. DAY AFTER DAY AND I STILL HAVE NEVER BEEN TESTED. NURSE'S REPORT THAT THEY ARE ROUTINELY DENIED TESTING PER CODE NINETEEN BY THEIR EMPLOYER DESPITE HAVING KNOWN EXPOSURES. AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OUT SICK ARE DENIED RETESTING TO CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER INFECTIOUS BEFORE THEY RETURN TO WORK. IN MANY CASES MANAGEMENT HAS SOME NARROWLY DEFINED WHAT COUNTS AS AN EXPOSURE. THAT EVEN WHEN NURSES DO MEET THE THRESHOLD. THE END AREN'T SHOWING OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS THEY ARE STILL DISCOURAGED FROM TESTING AS WELL. GIVEN THE EXTREMELY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF A SYMPTOMATIC TRANSMISSION AND THE MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT THIS VIRUS IS AIRBORNE. C. N. A. STANDS FIRM AND URGES OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO IMMEDIATELY ADOPT A WIDESPREAD TESTING IN ISOLATION PROTOCOL. AS WELL AS MORE TRANSPARENT REPORTING OF DATA TO HOSPITALS. TO DO ANYTHING LESS AND CONTINUE RE OPENING IS A DEADLY MISTAKE. THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING SAFETY GUIDELINES FROM THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TRUST TO KEEP US SAFE AT WORK. ARE NO LONGER ALIGNED WITH THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND IS LED TO THE COMPLETE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR EMPLOYERS. OUR HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AND OUR GOVERNMENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CMMUNITIES. AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ABOUT PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY OUR NURSES ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO GET WORKERS COMP AND. DISABILITY PAY WHEN THEY DO TEST POSITIVE. WE HAVE HAD STRUGGLE THE COPY DISSONANCE CREATED WHEN OUR COMMUNITIES OUR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS AND SOMETIMES EVEN OUR OWN CO WORKERS. STILL DO NOT TAKE THIS PANDEMIC SERIOUSLY AND DO NOT PRACTICE SAFE BEHAVIORS WEARING A MASK AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING IS NOT A POLITICAL PLOY IT IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE. WE'VE HAD OVER SEVEN MONTHS TO WATCH OKAY THANK YOU THE WATCH LEARNING COLLECT OBSERVATIONAL DATA FROM THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSE AROUND THE WORLD WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION TO PREVENT MASS CASUALTIES AND USE THAT INFORMATION TO GUIDE OUR ACTIONS MOVING FORWARD. WE NEED TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT NOT IS NOT WHAT IS EASY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS ARLEN WE APPRECIATE THAT.

IN THIS INDUSTRY I'VE ONLY FOUND ONE JOB WHERE I WORK THAT FOR TWO MONTHS THAT DID PAY MINIMUM WAGE. FOR GARMENT WORKERS OVERTIME PAY DOESN'T EXIST.

I JUST WANT TO ASK VERY QUICKLY SORRY. THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT SOME INFORMATION OF OUR SAID OF TWENTY- FROM THE L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF. PUBLIC HEALTH THERE WERE TWELVE OUTBREAKS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED SPECIFICALLY IN APPAREL MANUFACTURING SECTOR. WITH A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR OUTBREAK ASSOCIATED CASES- SO THESE CASES ARE ONLY AS PARTS OF OUTBREAKS SO THAT'S BETWEEN THREE AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE CASES PER OUTBREAK- AND MANY INFECTIONS IN GARMENT- AS WELL AS THAT SCHOOL AND REPORTED IT BUT WORKERS ARE VERY AWARE OF THEM AND INFORM THEM. INFORM US OF THEM ALL THE TIME- CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS THIS WIDESPREAD EXPECTATION TO BECOME EVEN MORE ENTRENCHED DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. LIKE THE ONE THAT WE'RE IN NOW. BRANDER NOT HELD LIABLE FOR PRICING MODELS FOR THE WORKING CONDITIONS- IN SMALL BUSINESSES COMPETE FOR ORDERS THAT ARE NOT PRICED MEET MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS WHY FIFTY FIVE HIGH ROAD BUSINESSES SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT WORKER PROTECTION. ACT AND THAT'S TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. THE RATED THE PEACHTREE DECREASE AS THE ORDERS ARE NEED RATE THEY GO FROM THE BRAND TO THE MANUFACTURE AND THEN SUBCONTRACTED OVER TO FACTORIES. AND THAT RATE IS SO LOW THAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW WORKERS TO BE PAID MINIMUM WAGE- THE P. THREE IT THIS INCENTIVIZE WORKERS FROM TAKING HEALTH PRECAUTIONS LIKE REGULARLY WASHING YOUR HANDS OR EVEN TAKING BREAKS- AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED THE GARMENT WORKER PROTECTION ACT. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY FELL TO BE BROUGHT UP TO ROLE IN THE ASSEMBLY THIS YEAR SO WILL BE RE INTRODUCING THE LEGISLATION NEXT YEAR- THIS EXPECTATION IN GARMENT IS NOT SOLVABLE JIM FORSMAN ONLY. IT HASN'T WORKED WE RECORDED HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES I THINK. EIGHT NINETY THREE SB EIGHT AND OFTEN THE STATE PUTS THE BILL FOR THESE UNPAID WAGE CLAIMS THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I THINK YOU FOR HAVING THE GARMENT WORKER CENTER TODAY THANK YOU IMMEDIATE ACCESS SANTIAGO BUT SO THAT'S THE BONO. OKAY YOU IN THE NEXT AND LAST PANELIST TODAY WILL BE ROSA MILLION OF THE LAW ANGELES COUNTY LAY FED. THANK YOU MARIE. THANK YOU- MY NAME IS ROSE MARIE MOLINA I'M THE ORGANIZING DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR AND I'M HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE INSIGHT ON HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES IN THE WAREHOUSING INDUSTRY. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY CORPORATE NINETEEN. WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION IS A KEY SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK IN WAREHOUSES IN CALIFORNIA. AND MANY OF THE ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS OF COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON ARE GROWING AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE AT FULL CAPACITY THROUGH THE SHUTDOWN. DURING THIS PANDEMIC THE WAREHOUSING INDUSTRY HAS X. TO WEAKEN DO FOR INCREASED ARRAY OF PRODUCTS AND SHORTEN DELIVERY TIMES. SOME COMPANIES PROMISED GOODS WITHIN THE SAME DAY OF PURCHASE WHILE OTHERS WITHIN HOURS IN THE LA AREA WE'VE SEEN SOME COMPANIES NEARLY DOUBLE THEIR WAREHOUSING AND DELIVERY CAPACITY SINCE MARCH BECAUSE OF THIS DEMAND. BUT MEETING THIS DEMAND COMES IN THE STATE. COST TO WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE NOTCE TO INTERVENE IN WAREHOUSING SAFETY DURING THESE TIMES. ONE OF THE BIGGEST HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES WE ARE SEEING IN WAREHOUSING DURING THIS TIME IS THE INABILITY OF WORKERS TO TAKE BREAKS AND SANITIZE THEIR EQUIPMENT AND STATIONS. IT WAS HARD FOR WORKERS TO TAKE BREAKS BEFORE THE VIRUS AND CURRENT HEALTH ORDERS CALL FOR MORE BREAKS TO ENSURE THAT PROPER SANITATION AND SAFETY IS BEING MET. THAT WORKERS DON'T HAVE THE ROOM WE DON'T FEEL THAT THEY HAVE THE ROOM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROTOCOLS. THE EMPLOYERS ARE TELLING WORKERS TO TAKE BREAKS WORKERS FEEL THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE LIBERTY TO TAKE THEM IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST OUR PRODUCTIVITY AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND THIS ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN PENALTIES FOR WORKERS AND THIS IS CENTER VISINE THE USAGE OF BREAKS. A FORMER AMAZON WORKER IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY DESCRIBED HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR HER TO TAKE A BREAK UNDER THEIR TIME OFF TASK SYSTEM AND HIGH DEMANDING POTUS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THERE WERE INSTANCES WHERE SHE WOULD HAVE TO HAND HER SCANNER OVER TO A COWORKER TO KEEP SCANNING WELL SHE RAN TO THE RESTROOM THAT WAS NEARLY SEVEN MINUTES AWAY FROM HER STATION. A CURRENT WALMART WAREHOUSE WORKER AND SABATINO COUNTY TOLD. US THAT EVEN WITH COBIT THE CODE IS STILL THE- WE HAVE NOT STOPPED AT ALL TO WASH YOUR HANDS MORE. HOWEVER OUR WORKERS TO STOP THEY'RE STILL DEMAND TO MAINTAIN THE QUOTA TWO. ITEM AND TO PICK MORE EVERY HOUR. WORKERS DON'T WANT TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED. AND THEY'RE ALSO TERRIFIED OF BEING CALLED HOME TO THEIR FAMILY. TALKING TO A WAREHOUSE WORKER ADVOCATE HERE IN LA WE FOUND THAT WHEN COMPLAINTS WERE FILED. WITH STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES THEIR RESPONSE WAS SLOW OR ARE SIMPLY INADEQUATE. AND ONE AMAZON DELIVERY STATION IN LOS ANGELES OVER FORTY CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN EVEN ONE DAY. AND LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTIGATED THE COMPLAINT. BUT ONLY TALK TO MANAGEMENT AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. THE INVESTIGATOR FOUND THAT SANITATION EQUIPMENT HAD BEEN SET UP SIGNAGE PUT OUT AND SIX FOOT MARKERS PLACED ALONG THE FLOOR. IN AUSTIN GOOD AND WELL THEY CLOSE THE CASE. HOWEVER BECAUSE THAT INVESTIGATOR FAILED TO SPEAK TO WORKERS. THEY DIDN'T FIND THAT SHARED EQUIPMENT WASN'T BEING SANITIZED. THAT WORKERS DIDN'T HAVE MATERIALS OR THE TIME TO SANITISE STATIONS IN BETWEEN SHIPS. AND THAT THESE PACKAGES THAT COME TO OUR DOORSTEP SAME DAY OR PASSING BETWEEN FOUR TO FIVE WORKERS. WITHOUT PROPER PROTECTION. AS ADVOCATES WE WELCOME THE EXPANSION OF WORK IN THE WAREHOUSING INDUSTRY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE. SO IN LOS ANGELES WERE FINDING CREATIVE WAYS TO STOP THE SPREAD OF KOBE. THIS MOMENT CALLS FOR QUICK INNOVATION. USING THE TOOLS WE HAVE NOW IN CREATING SOME MORE. WE'VE INTRODUCED A POLICY INITIATIVE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR PUBLIC HEALTH COUNCILS. THEY WANTED RISK CONTEXTUALIZES SITUATION DOWN HERE IN LA. WORKED AT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND POSITIVE CASES JUST IN OUR REGION. AND SIX HUNDRED. SIX THOUSAND EIGHTY ONE DEATHS THAT'S NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO AREN'T COMING HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES. AND IN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HALF OF TRANSMISSION COMES FROM THE WORKPLACE WE HEARD ABOUT THIS TO DATE WITH THE OTHER PANEL. THIS MEANS THAT STOPPING THE SPREAD ABOUT BREAKS. TO THE PUBLIC STARTS IN THE WORKPLACE. LOS ANGELES PUT HEALTH CARE CALL WITH A WORKERS AN ESSENTIAL WORKPLACES TO FORM COMMITTEES TO ENFORCE THE COUNTY HEALTH BORDERS. THIS MEANS WORKERS WOULD BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT STANDARDS ARE MET. INCLUDING STANDARDS AROUND SOCIAL DISTANCING PP AND OTHER OTHER COVERT RELATED MEASURES. WE KNOW THAT THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IS AN ISSUE. WITH PUBLIC HEALTH COUNCILS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CARE LOCALLY COULD DEPUTISE THIRD PARTY WORK ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP TRAIN WORKERS. ON THE COUNTY HELP ORDER AND COULD HELP REFER WORKERS TO THE DEPARTMENT. ABOUT COMPLETING CASES OF NON COMPLIANCE. THIS POLICY COMES FROM A NEED TO ENSURE THAT COMPLIANCE IS BEING MET SO THAT THE PUBLIC OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILY STOP GETTING SICK. EARLY INVESTIGATIONS FOUND THAT WE HAVE 50% NONCOMPLIANCE IN SOME INDUSTRIES EIGHTY PERCENT. AND WHERE HOUSING CONTINUES TO BE AN INDUSTRY WITH HIGHER OUTBREAKS HERE ELLIE. THANK WORKERS ARE YOU MAKING THE VIRUS BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO REOPEN WE KNOW THIS GREATER PUBLIC RISK WE DON'T WANT THE ECONOMY TO SHUT DOWN AGAIN- WE WANT TO WORK WITH MANAGEMENT WORK WITH WORKERS AND THE DEPARTMENT TO STOP THE SPREAD. I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THE TIME TO SPEAK AND I HOPE THE STATE MAKES ALL THE- THE RIGHT DECISIONS INCREASING HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS. FOR THE PUBLIC FOR ALL WORKERS. WE'RE TIRED OF BURYING OUR MEMBERS AND WE KNOW THAT GREATER PREVENTIVE MEASURES CAN BE TAKEN ESPECIALLY FROM THE STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MOLINA. WELL THAT WAS A GREAT PANEL- OF THE CALIFORNIA WORK FORCE FRONTLINE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME- IN PROVIDING US MORE INSIGHT ON. ON EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOUR ROLES WE- I MUCH APPRECIATE THE BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO MEMBERS. AND COMMENTS I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PARTICIPATE ONCE AGAIN TO CALL AND NOW. A PLEASE DIAL THE TOLL FREE NUMBER. ONE EIGHT FOUR FOUR. TWO NINE ONE. SIX THREE SIX FOUR WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE. SEVEN SIX TWO. ONE TWO SEVEN NINE SO I'LL ACTUALLY START THE FIRST ROUND OF QUESTIONS THEN I'LL KICK IT OFF TO A FEW OF OUR- MEMBERS HERE IN THE COMMITTEE WHO HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND IT WAS GOING BACK TO THE- QUESTION OF INVESTIGATION PERIOD- WE CAN USE THE FOSTER FARM EXAMPLE I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE THE CITY OF VERNON. WHICH HAS BEEN VERY CONCERNING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY A MEAT PACKING INDUSTRY- WITH FARMER JOHN'S- IN MY BACKYARD AND- I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHEN DOES THE INVESTIGATION PERIOD START. AND WHAT OF WHAT- THAT'S KIND OF STEPS ALONG THE WAY WITHOUT GETTING TOO TECHNICAL ON ON A SPECIFIC SITE. BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT AND THEN WHEN. IT IS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S A SIX MONTH PERIOD. DO WE NEED TO SHORTEN THAT TIME BECAUSE SIX MONTHS IS A VERY LONG TIME ESPECIALLY THIS CODE ENVIRONMENT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KICK THAT OFF THAT QUESTION OFTEN I WILL ASK EITHER DIRECTOR HAGEN OR CHIEF PARKER. I CAN ADDRESS THAT QUESTION- SO THAT THE- THE SIX MONTH PERIOD JUST SO YOU KNOW IS OUR IS OUR STATUE LIMITATIONS IT'S- HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEGAL DATA- TO- ISSUE A CITATION FROM THANK YOU BOTH YOU KNOW. BEFORE EMPLOYER CAN RAISE THE DEFENSE THAT WE ARE OUT OF TIME TO ISSUE THE CITATION SO I WOULDN'T I WOULD NOT YOU KNOW I WOULD NOT- SUGGESTS SHORTENING THAT- BUT I AM. EAGER TO EVALUATE OUR SYSTEMS AND FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT WE COULD SHORTEN OUR PROCESS OVERALL. TO ADDRESS THE KIND OF PROCESS- NAY AN INVESTIGATION COMMENCES- THAT TYPICALLY- YOU KNOW IT WHEN THE- IN RESPONSE TO A SERIOUS COMPLAINT FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THE COMPLAINT. BEING RECEIVED BY THE KALOGEROPOULOS- THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF BEGINS WITH- WHEN OPENING CONFERENCE WITH THE EMPLOYER THERE'S OFTEN ALSO- REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS- WE'RE WE'RE WE- INTRODUCED THE ISSUES GO OVER WHAT THE FACTS AND ENTAIL- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES. AFTER THAT IS THE PHYSICAL INSPECTION- SOMETIMES RETURN VISITS ARE NECESSARY- SOMETIMES- TESTING AND MONITORING IS NECESSARY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF INVESTIGATION IT IS AND THEN OCCASIONALLY WE DON'T GET COOPERATION AND WE HAVE TO GO AND SEEK WARM OR TO PHYSICALLY ENTER THE PROPERTY- AFTER THAT THERE'S THE REVIEW OF HE DOCUMENTS- PLANS RECORDS INJURY AND ILLNESS REPORTS- THERE SOMETIMES DISPUTES OVER I DOCUMENTS THAT TAKE TIME YOU KNOW ATTAINING DOCUMENTS- THERE'S THE INTERVIEWS OF WITNESSES. SO WE ARE REQUIRED TO INTERVIEW BOTH MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES WITNESSES CURRENTLY A LOT OF THAT IS HAPPENING OVER THE PHONE SO THAT'S YOU KNOW ARRANGE TO REMOTELY SYSTEM REDUCED RISK OF IT- OUR OUR EXPOSURE I SHOULD SAY- THEN WE OF COURSE VARIOUS INTERNAL PROCEDURES RECORD KEEPING WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY YOU WITH THE EVIDENCE THERE'S A REVIEW BY MANAGERS- SHE- REVIEWED BY LEGAL. TIME AND COURSE ALL OF THAT IS GOING ON WITH CODE NINE BECAUSE IT DISNEY TO US TO WE DON'T A CLEAR. ON IT AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND MINDFUL AS WE ARE DIVING IN THE CASES TO PUT THEM TOGETHER- AND THEN WE'RE ALSO REVIEWING FOR CONSISTENCY AS WE HAVE. SEVENTEEN DISTRICT OFFICES IN FOUR REGIONS- ACTUALLY FIVE REGENTS INVOLVE ACTIVELY AND- RIGHT NOW IN THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH. AND SO. A FEW ARE YOU KNOW I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE CASE TAKES- ABOUT AND AROUND NINETY DAYS FROM START TO FINISH- BECAUSE THE CASES ARE TAKING AROUND SEVENTY FROM THE INITIATION INVESTIGATION. WHEN THE CITATION IS ISSUED- YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN I CAME HERE AND I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT A YEAR WAS TO. REALLY EVALUATE WHAT. YOU KNOW HOW HOW WE CAN SHAVE TIME OFF OF THAT PROCESS- AND- YEAH WE'VE DONE WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF WAYS IN THE CO THE CONTEXT YOU KNOW WE'VE USED. SOME OF THESE SWEEPS LIKE WE'VE DONE IN AGRICULTURE WHERE WE SET A GOAL OF. ISSUING A CITATION AND- THE GENERAL CITATION THIRTY DAYS ARE A SERIES LOCATION FORTY FIVE DAYS- BUT YOU KNOW THAT OF COURSE TAKES TIME AWAY FROM OTHER INVESTIGATIONS- WE ALSO RIGHT NOW HAVE. A RELATIVELY- LOW NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL HIGH JANICE AND OTHER. SPECIALIST IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE. AND SO- THAT CREATES SOME BOTTLENECKS. IN THE REVIEW PROCESS AS WELL. WE CLEAR MORE COME CASE. AND SO YOU KNOW WE THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS WERE EAGER TO LOOK AT- YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY. RIGHT MY JOB. MY LAST JOB IN GOVERNMENT WAS THAT. AT THE FEDERAL MINE SAFETY HEALTH ADMINISTRATION AND NO. WE WERE ABLE TO ACT PRETTY QUICKLY UNDER THE SOUTH LOSS THAT WE HAD THEIR PROCEDURES WE GET THERE. YEAH WE HAVE A BIG WORKLOAD HERE WE HAVE A LOT OF EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES WE HAVE A RELATIVELY FORMAL ADJUDICATION PROCESS- THAT REQUIRES YOU KNOW THE WAY WE GATHER EVIDENCE. THAT SORT OF THING TO BE PRETTY THOROUGH- BUT- YEAH. AS I SAID I'M VERY EAGER TO EXAMINE HOW WE SHORTEN THAT PROCESS BUT THERE IS A LOT IN THERE THAT WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW. MOST CERTAINLY CHIEF OF PARKER AND I THINK YOU FOR THAT AND I THINK- FROM WHAT I'M GATHERING HERE IS THAT WE- WE WOULD WANT TO ENSURE HOW WE- CAN CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER WITH YOU TO SHORTEN THAT PROCESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. GIVEN THIS TESTIMONY AND GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF MANY OF THESE ISSUES WHICH HAVE RESULTED UNFORTUNATELY AND WORKER DEATHS- THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE AND THEN I WILL SEND IT OFF TO A- SENATOR. WHO DOCILE. IS ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION CAN BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE PRE OP PROACTIVE AS- MANY OF THE- WORK FORCE IS MENTIONED. A LOT OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE DRIVEN BY EMPLOYEES OR RELIANT ON EMPLOYEES TO. TO FILE A COMPLAINT. I KNOW WE ONLY HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES TO YOUR POINT AND I KNOW YOU ALL ARE WORKING VERY VERY HARD BUT- WHAT OTHER THOUGHTS DO WE HAVE IN THE PIPELINE ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE PRO ACTIVE. ESPECIALLY IN THESE AREAS THAT WE KNOW ARE HARDEST HIT. AND WORKING WITH THE COUNTY IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ALSO PROACTIVE- ON WITH MANY OF THESE ISSUES OF. THIS DISTURBED DESCRIBED HERE TODAY. I CAN START TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION I I'VE MENTIONED- THAT. OUTREACH A COUPLE OF TIMES AND- LIKE DOUG. I'M ALSO A NEWCOMER AT THE A. R. AND SO STILL LEARNING THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT MY OBSERVATIONS HAVE. BEEN THAT- ENFORCEMENT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS- YOU KNOW. FOLKS UNDERSTAND- THAT THERE WITH THE RULES AND THE GUIDELINES THAT WERE FACED WITH AND SO. HUGE EFFORT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY. WITHIN D. I. R. WITHIN THE AGENCY AND ACROSS THE STATE TO. REALLY CONDUCT A LOT OF OUTREACH- BUT YOUR QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO GOING FORWARD- WE HAVE- AS A RESULT OF SB ONE FIFTEEN- WE RECEIVED A- A FUSION OF FUNDING. FOR OUTREACH EFFORTS A SPECIFIC TWO. OCTOBER NINETEEN AND- WE HAVE A PUBLIC AWARENESS MEDIA CAMPAIGN PLANNED- IS A MULTI TIERED- STRATEGY- USING PAID MEDIA. BOB AND IT'S- INDUSTRY TARGET SO. YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED- EXTENSIVELY ON AGRICULTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE TO BE- FOCUS ON AGRICULTURE BUT AS WELL AS FOOD PROCESSING- INCLUDING MEAT PACKING- JANITORIAL- INCLUDING HOUSEKEEPING AND HOSPITALITY. FOOD SERVICES OUR RESTAURANT AND GROCERY WAREHOUSE AND LOGISTICS AND MANUFACTURING INCLUDING THE GARMENT INDUSTRY- IN OUR PRIMARY MESSAGES- ARE ON EXISTING AND NEW LABOR RATES- INTENDED TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS AND NOT AND- THAT'S WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH- IS ENFORCED BY CALIBRATION. HEAT SICK LEAVE- WORKERS COMPENSATION AND ANTI RETALIATION PROTECTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC AWARENESS MEDIA CAMPAIGN- OUR AGENCY IS LEADING OUR EFFORTS THAT AND LABOR AND WORKFORCE AGENCIES LEADING EFFORTS IN. ESTABLISHING A WORKER AND EMPLOYER TRAINING PROGRAM- AND ALSO INCLUDED- WITH WERE ABLE TO AND- IMPLEMENT THIS AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT FUNDING- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN DOING WEBINARS- AND DEVELOPING ONLINE MATERIALS BUT- WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO- ENHANCE THAT- ADD MORE INDUSTRY SPECIFICTRAINING- PARTICULARLY IN THOSE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE A HIGH INCIDENCE OF CODED- INJURIES REPORTED- AND I WILL. LEAVE IT AT THAT IN CASE THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS THANK YOU DIRECTOR HAGEN I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK- ALTHOUGH I WITH ALL DUE RESPECT APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGNS I THINK WE DO NEED TO DO MORE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY ENFORCING. I KNOW WE ARE AGAIN I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE REITERATING THAT- IT IS VERY CONCERNING TO HEAR FROM THIS WORK FORCE THAT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES THAT REMAIN- AND THE LACK OF AN FORSMAN OR THE FASTER FOR SOME IT'S I'M I'M IN LOVE M. INSPIRED WHEN. CHIEF PARKER SAYS THAT WE WILL LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO FIND HOW TO MAKE THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATION MORE EXPEDIENT SO I'M- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT COULD. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT AND IN THAT SENSE. WITH THAT I SAY THANK YOU AND I'M GOING TO SEND IT OFF TO SENATOR TO RUSSELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I AM. YOU KNOW AFTER HEARING ESPECIALLY ALL THE TESTIMONY FROM OF THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THESE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES- ONE THING THAT KEEPS COMING COMING BACK AND I KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN SEVERAL OF THOSE INDUSTRIES IS THAT THERE IS ENORMOUS FEAR. HIS FEAR AND- THE PUBLIC AWARENESS OR THE PUBLIC EDUCATION- NOTICES IS A GOOD THING TO DO NOT OPPOSED TO IT BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME. COME BACK- SORT OF LIKE I'M WATCHING YOUR BACK OF MR WORKER MISS WORKERS- THAT BY. FOURTEEN THESE CONDITIONS I'M NOT GONNA LOSE MY JOB. I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S REALLY OF A BOTTOM LINE PEOPLE'S LIVES LIFE IS AT STAKE BUT THEIR LIVELIHOOD IS AT STAKE AND VERY FEW OF US EVER. GO THROUGH THAT IN LIFE- SOME MORE THAN OTHERS SO. I GUESS THE- WE HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO. THE LEADERSHIP TO THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE INCLUDED- OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DO MORE OF THIS WORK IN THE WORKPLACE- SO. I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S USED IN THE RIGHT WAY IN THAT IT EFFECTIVELY ADAM IN THE RIGHT WAY THE EFFECTIVE WAY- AND I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT. WHAT WE GET COULDN'T ADVISE TO DO IS A LOT OF BILLBOARDS AND COMMERCIALS AND ADS AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AND THAT JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT THAT JUST IT'S PART OF IT. BUT IT'S NOT THE BULK OF IT SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY MORE MORE THOUGHTS- BY MISTAKEN OR MISTER PARKER ALL WE HAVE THE RESOURCES. IS THERE A WAY OR LET'S FIND A WAY WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON FINDING A WAY. TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS PUT MORE PEOPLE IN PLACE SO THAT THE TIMING AND IT AND IT SHOWS THAT GOVERNMENT IS REALLY GOING TO PROTECT THOSE MEN AND WOMEN. AS THEY PUT THEM THEMSELVES ON THE LINE ON ON THE HEALTH CARE FRONT. ANY MORE THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU AND THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY QUESTION MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL. DO WE HAVE ANY OF THE PANELISTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON SENATOR DEDUCTIBLES. QUESTIONS. OKAY I CAN I CAN ADDRESS PART OF IT WHICH IS THE- YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE EFFECTIVELY CONDUCT OUTREACH AND I AGREE WITH YOU AND ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING CARE AND pTHAT WE ARE IN FACT. TARGETING AN AFFECT OF WAY OUR EFFORTS TO REACH THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HARD TO REACH WORKERS- IT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED AND- YOU KNOW WE SPEND ENGAGE WITH. YOU KNOW WITH THE LABOR CENTERS AND- AND I APPRECIATE THAT HELP HEALTH AND SAFETY CENTER- I MEAN AT UC BERKELEY AND BERKELEY AND THIS WHILE. THE WANTED UCLA- FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF. IDENTIFYING THOSE TYPES OF STRATEGIES SO- YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF- SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO. BUILD INTO OUR COMMUNICATION STRATEGY- AND- YOU KNOW WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT IT'S NOT EASY AND WE ARE GOING TO NEED- YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL GUIDES FROM FROM. PEOPLE MORE MORE FAMILIAR WITH. THE SPECIALLY WORKERS ARE TO DO IT. GREAT THANK YOU CHIEF PARKER. I WILL THEN MOVE ON TO SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU TERRY GONZALEZ AND THE FIRST OF I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND REPRESENTATIVES TESTIFIED AND- REALLY APPRECIATE THAT TESTIMONY. I DID HAVE A FIRST CLASS QUESTION MAINLY FOR CD P. H. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP FOR ALSO- I CAL OSHA SELF STARTING WITH C. PH. THIS IS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS WILL BE FUN THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT IS TESTING AND I KNOW THAT C. PEACHES MENTIONED THAT- AS THEY'RE DEVELOPING GUIDELINES- THERE MAY BE CERTAIN PLACES WHERE THEY WILL CALL FOR SURVEILLANCE TESTING. AND SO IT GETS PART OF MY QUESTIONS ABOUT ACCESS TO TESTING AND ALSO IS THERE A MANDATE IF THE TEST IS DONE IN A WORK PLACE ESPECIALLY IF YOU USING SOME OF THESE. TESTS THAT CAN BE DONE LET'S SAY A UNIT THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE WORKPLACE SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY SENT FORMALLY TO A LAB. GEN OBLIGATION BY WORKPLACES REPORT THE RESULTS OF THOSE TESTS TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SEEKING WHAT THE RESULTS ARE. AND CERTAINLY I THINK RECENT EVENTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE SHOWN THERE ARE CERTAIN THE LIMITATIONS THE TESTING ITSELF. AS A STRATEGY BUT CERTAINLY TESTING AS PART OF THAT SO WE WILL BE SURE THAT WE GET ACCESS TO THE RESULTS OF ALL TESTS. ARE PERFORMED RELATED TO THE WORKPLACE SO I CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT- AND THEN FOLLOW UP TO THAT. IS A SAID TESTING ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH CONTACT TRACING. SO WHAT IS OUR CONTACT RAISING CAPACITY- SO WHEN AS WE GET RESULTS AND SPECIALLY IF WE HAVE A POSITIVE RESULT IN THE WORKPLACE ARE THEY ALL BEING CONTACTED TRACED. US SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- WE NEED TO BE SURE IS HAPPENING AS WELL SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THESE POSITIVES ARE BEING CONTACTED SNOW WHAT DEGREE. IS THERE. AN EXPERIENCE OF THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S. IT'S OUR COOPERATION FROM THE WORKPLACES IN THE CONTACT RACING EFFORTS- NOT ONLY OF COURSE FOR THE WORKERS BUT THEY HAVE CUSTOMERS OR OTHER PEOPLE IN THEIR SITE AS WELL. SO BASICALLY FIRST OF ALL TESTING ESPECIALLY REQUIRING FOR SURVEILLANCE. TESTING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTH ACCESS TEST. THAT CAN BE DONE. AS WELL AS REQUIREMENTS FOR TEST RESULTS BEFORE TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND THEN FOLLOWING THAT TO THE CONTACT RACING EFFORTS SO. IT WHICH IS ALSO PERHAPS ONE THE WAYS THAT WE CAN THEN IDENTIFY. WORKPLACE THAT NEED TO BE REFERRED TO CARLOS IS I GUESS THE THIRD PART IF YOU ARE DOING CONTACT TRACING ARE YOU REPORTING THOSE RESULTS IN ADDITION. RECOGNIZING THAT THE MAINTAIN PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY TO CALLOW SHOW FOR WORKPLACE INVESTIGATION. THANK YOU SENATOR PAT AND I THINK THAT'S DIRECTED TO- THE CVHS CORRECT YES. AND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW UP FOR COLLISION YOU WANT TO START ON THE TESTING ISSUES AND THEN I CAN FOLLOW UP ON CONTACT TRACING. SURE YEAH. SO I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION WAS IN REGARDS TO- ACCESS TO TESTING. AND I. BASICALLY I COUPLE OF WAYS FOR ACCESSING TESTING FIRST AND I THINK YOU ALSO ASKED ABOUT SURVEILLANCE TESTING SO. IN REGARDS TO THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WERE BURDEN NEAR FINALIZING IT. BOOKS THAT ARE VARIOUS WORKER COHORTS IN IN HOUSE. LOOKS AT. WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR AND I'M GOING SCREENING. I'M TESTING WHICH SHOULD BE WHERE YOU'RE TESTING TO LOOK FOR. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE POSITIVE BY A SYMPTOMATIC- RESPONSE TESTING WHEN THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIED WHOSE POSITIVE TO THEN. RESPOND TO THAT ADDITIONAL TESTING- AND- I. SURVEILLANCE TESTING AS A WHOLE ISN'T JUST LOOKING TO SEE WHAT SORT OF THE OVERALL POSITIVITY RATE IN A GIVEN. POPULATIONS TO HELP MAKE PLANS FOR. BOARD TESTING IN THE FUTURE. THE STRATEGIC PLAN IS LOOKING PREDOMINANTLY AT. SCREENING TESTING IN RESPONSE TESTING. D. AS FAR AS TESTING ACCESS AMINATION OF THINGS I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE OF THE STATE RUN TESTING SITES CURRENTLY I'M OVER A HUNDRED I EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FIVE OPTUM SERVES SITE AND ARE. SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIX WELL BY ALL OF THE SITES WHERE WORKERS CAN GO AND GET TESTED THEIR NECKS AND SOME NOT SO THAT SOMEONE'S AT A WORKPLACE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING GOES SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY WON'T GET TESTING ON SITE BUT STILL. PART OF WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON AS WELL- WHAT'S BEING REVIEWED RIGHT NOW- R. D. I REQUEST FOR INNOVATION. WE'RE IN THE FINAL PHASE OF REVIEW OF THAT. TODAY AND THROUGHOUT THIS WEEK AND THOSE ARE LOOKING OUT MORE I'M CREATIVELY USE WHERE. THERE MAY BE. SOME OPTIONS FOR A MOLE BY TEAMS OR UNITS I'M TERRY GO TO. VARIOUS LOCATIONS ARE POTENTIALLY INCLUDING WORKER LOCATIONS OR TEAM. COULD GO OUT AND TEST. A WORKER AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR CREATIVE WAYS INDUSTRY WE'RE ALSO AT IT REALLY. HOME SO THAT FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T WANT TO COME OUT TO BE TESTING LOCATION THEY COULD ACCESS TESTING AT HOME. THOSE IN COMBINATION WITH THE STATE LAB THAT'S SCHEDULED TO OPEN I THINK WILL OPEN ACCESS TO TESTING. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE- THIS WEEK RECEIVING THE- BY NOW NOW IMAGINE TEST AND ARE ANTICIPATING- GETTING RELATIVELY REGULAR HI ALLOTMENTS OF THOSE TESTS AND- THOSE TESTS ARE BEING GIVEN TO STATES BASED ON A PER CAPITA BASIS A HUNDRED MILLION- SPLIT ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO CALIFORNIANS ANTICIPATING ABOUT TEN MILLION OF THOSE- AND THOSE WILL. BE CENTER COUNTY IS BASED ON. POPULATION IN CASE RATE INITIALLY- AND THEN AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF THOSE TESTS GO OUT THEN WE'LL ADD THE EQUITY METRICS WE TRIED TO ADD THE EQUITY METRIC INITIALLY BUT IT MEANT THAT. WHEN WE ADDED THAT THAT SOME COUNTIES WOULD END UP WITH NO TESTS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. YEAH RIGHT. THE START THAT OUR ON COUNTIES IT'S OF THESE IMAGES TEST AND THEN THE SUBS SUBSEQUENT ROUND OF ONE. EQUITY HAS. AND THOSE TESTER BEST YOU FIRST. INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A WEEK OF SYMPTOM ONSET SO FOR THOSE. WORKERS WHO ARE SYMPTOMATIC I'M- THE IMAGE TEST ALSO BE A GOOD TEST FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. OKAY LINDUP ARE WORKPLACE SO THAT OUR WORKPLACES OBLIGATED TO REPORT RESULTS OF TESTS THEY'RE DONE RELATED TO THE WORK PLACE. I THINK BARBARA CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YEAH SO CURRENT. CURRENTLY WORK PLACES ARE NOT REQUIRED WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DO ONGOING SCREENING OF WORKERS RUN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE WE ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT OTHER HEALTH FACILITIES TO IMPLEMENT THAT KIND OF SCREENING. BUT WHEN PCR TESTS ARE DONE THERE THEY HAVE TO HAVE TO BE ANALYZED BY LABORATORY AND THOSE LABORATORIES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IT MIGHT BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE AND IT'S GOING TO GET A CLEAR ANSWER IS THAT. CURRENTLY YES IF YOU HAVE A TESTING GOES TO A LAB THE LAB IS RECORD REQUIRED TO TAP TO REPORT THAT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO HEARING THINGS LIKE ANTIGEN TESTING THERE'S OTHER TYPES OF TESTING MODALITIES THAT. MAY NOT NECESSARILY MEAN YOU HAVE SENT TO A LAB YOU CAN JUST SORT OF DO IT RIGHT THERE WITH THE CHECK. AND SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT IF THE WORKPLACE USES TO DO THAT AND I'M NOT SURE THE ENGINE TEST YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MIGHT DISTRIBUTE. IF ARE THOSE RESULTS ALSO MANDATED TO BE REPORTED TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SO THEY KNOW WHEN SOMEONE'S POSITIVE. YES THE CARD TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT INTO CAL RANDY .COM THANK YOU THAT'S RIGHT AND THEN WE CAN NOW MOVE ON TO CONTACT TRACING CAPACITY. SURE SO LET ME JUST EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW ABOUT HOW IT WORKS IT BEGAN WORKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN A POSITIVE CASES REPORTED TO A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE THEIR TEAMS IN PLACE TO DO CONTACT TRACING. THE STATE IS SUPPLEMENTING THAT I'VE HEARD A LOT WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF C. T. PAY TO FORTIES WHO HAVE BEEN DETAILED TO WORK FOR COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS- BUT- ARENA LIKELY AND THAT'S A GOOD THING APPRECIATE THAT. ARE YOU AND I REALIZE IT IS THE ROLE OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO DO MOST OF THAT ARE WE TRACKING HOW YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY'RE ABLE TO DO CONTACT TRACING EIGHT SO I APPRECIATE OF GUNS AND INFORMATION RIGHT NOW WE CAN BY CONTRACTORS NINETY PERCENT. BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR WORKPLACE OUTBREAKS ARE OR WERE AGENCY OUTBREAKS BUT FOR PART OF THE CASES THAT MAY AFFECT THE WORKPLACE IS THERE- ARE WE HITTING. A 100% INCOME. ASING ONES THAT AFFECT WORK PLACES. LIKE ALL RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW LIKE ARE WE TRACKING THAT. I CAN'T ANSWER THAT AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT- ONCE IT BECOMES AN OUTBREAK I HAVE TO SAY AGAIN THAT THERE'S SORT OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT- SOMETIMES THEY THEY- THE EMPLOYER HAS A CAPACITY LIKE FOR A LARGE EMPLOYER WITH THE HAVE OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE EXPERTISE THEY CAN TAKE ON THE CONTACT TRACING PART OF THIS- AND THEN THAT ALL LEADS INTO WHO ELSE NEEDS TO BE TESTED AND FOLLOWED UP SO SOME OF THAT pRESPONSIBILITY CAN BE BORNE BY EMPLOYERS THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS THERE TO ENSURE THAT IT'S- STILL BEING. YOU KNOW CARRIED OUT PROPERLY THERE SHOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP THERE AND THAT'S ALL PART OF WHAT OUR GUIDANCE ON WORKPLACE FOLLOW UP. I SAID BE HELPFUL IN YA PRECIADO THE FOLLOW UP IS GETTING THAT IN. HEALTH STATUS TRACKING- CONTACT TRACING- IN TERMS OF AND I KNOW YOUR PRIDE TALKING MORE HEALTH FACILITIES WHICH HAVE THAT CAPACITY BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED YOU KNOW NOT HEALTH FACILITIES. AND THEN FINALLY MY THIRD PART OF THE QUESTION AS I SAID EARLIER. A WHAT POINT DOES THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS YOU'RE GETTING THESE POSITIVES AND YOU DURING THE CONTACT A SENIOR REALIZING THAT IT'S NOT AFFECTING WORKPLACES. THE WHAT POINT DO YOU CONTACT A CALLOW SHOWS THAT THEY KNOW. THAT HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WHERE DID CONTACT FACING NOW. WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE CONTACT TREES. THERE AT THESE WORKPLACES AND WE NOW NEED CAL OSHA TO GO IN AND TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. SO YOU KNOW EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WORKING WITH LOCAL DEPARTMENTS GIVING THEM SUPPORT. IN OUTBREAK SITUATIONS- A LOT OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE SO USED TO INTERACTING WITH KELLER CHAU AND MAKING REFERRALS LIKE THAT WE HAVE TRIED TO IN THE OUTBREAKS WERE WE SUPPORTED THEM BRING TOGETHER ALL OF THE AGENCIES INCLUDING CAL OSHA- COURT. IS PRESENT TO THEM THAT AN OPTION ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING COOPERATION FROM THE EMPLOYER ON HOW TO FOLLOW UP THE OUTBREAK APPROPRIATELY. ON SCENE HELP THEM MAKE A REFER TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO MAKE A REFERRAL OR IN SOME CASES WHAT WE DO WE CAN DO IT AS WELL SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE YOU KNOW SUPPORTING. THOSE LOCAL ENTITIES TO MAKE THAT DECISION ABOUT- AND I THINK WITH AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE IN PLACE WHERE. YOU KNOW PART OF THE PART OF THE INTENT BEHIND THAT IS TO HAVE MORE COOPERATION AND MORE TRANSPARENCY- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO POST ON OUR WEBSITE WHERE THESE OUTBREAKS ARE ARE. ARE GOING TO BE OUR WILL BE OCCURRING ON I THINK THE INTENT THERE IS TO HAVE US WORK EVEN MORE CLOSELY BETWEEN CITY PAGE COLORS AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THESE OUTBREAKS ARE BEING JUMPED ON FASTER I THINK THAT'S- PART OF THE INTENT TO. THANK YOU. TO ALL TO LEARN AND DO BETTER WITH THIS THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR I HOPE THE STATE WILL MONITOR. EACH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHILE I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN OUR COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS. UNFORTUNATELY SEEN IF YOU RESIGN BECAUSE OF POLITICAL PRESSURE SO WE NEED TO TRACK TO BE SURE ARE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DO THIS. AND THAT WHEN THEY MAKE REFERRALS THAT THEY DON'T GET INTO TROUBLE BUT THE LOCAL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- SO THAT'S SOMETHING AGAIN TO MONITORING FUNCTION SO I REALIZE THAT THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES TAKES PLACE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT THE STATE DOES NEED TO MONITOR. ENSURE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING I THINK THIS IS CRITICAL TO BE SURE THAT WE GET THAT. INFORMATION TO CALLOSUM ACCOUNT OSHA CAN ACT AS WELL NOW MY QUESTION IS FOR CAL OSHA AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THOSE ANSWERS. SO THE DATA HIGH HAVE HERE FROM THE BACKGROUND PAPER ACTUALLY ENCOMPASSES FAVORITE FIRST TO SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVEN SO YOU MAY HAVE TO COMMENT WHAT'S HAPPENING MORE RECENTLY VERSUS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN EARLIER ON. THE PANDEMICS BUT- I WOULD NOTE THAT- IN THIS REPORT THAT. THERE WERE ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND CODE RELATED COMPLAINTS HOWEVER ONLY. ELEVEN HUNDRED SO ABOUT ONE IN SIX WERE ACTUALLY ON SITE INSPECTIONS SO THE REST OF THEM. THE OTHER FIVE SIX WERE NOT AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS ARE EACH ONE. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT OF THOSE ONSITE INSPECTIONS- YOU KNOW YOU HAD. ABOUT THREE HUNDRED ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED WERE EITHER FATALITY INVESTIGATIONS AND SOMEONE DIED. FOR ILLNESS SIGNS ON RY GOT SICK IN FACT THAT NUMBER IS LARGER COMBINED THEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WERE FILED SO I THINK IT GOES BACK TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. HE SAID YOU KNOW COMPLAINING IS DANGEROUS IN ITSELF SO YOU YOU GOT TO DANGERS YOU GOT I COMPLAIN I GET FIRED. I GET SECOND OR DIE RIGHT- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE REFERRAL BASED INSPECTIONS IS FAIRLY SMALL SO I THINK WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO IN TERMS OF REFERRALS- PERHAPS- CAL OSHA CAN- CAN YOU JUST COMMENT. ON PARTICULAR WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING MORE RECENTLY SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF ON SITE INSPECTIONS IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CODE OR PLAY IT SEEMS TO BE VERY FEES YOU KNOW. ONE IN SIX SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY SMALL PERCENTAGE. IS THAT PERCENTAGE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING OR IS THAT MUCH HIGHER NOW THAN IT WAS IT PERHAPS AT THE BEGINNING THE PANDEMIC. AND THEN ALSO- HOPEFULLY- WE ARE- YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF TARGET CELLS AND THEN PERHAPS TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT'S TRIGGERING THESE AND THAT SORT OF THE FALL TO MY QUESTION THE C. P. H. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TALISA AND- HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FROM. YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF GETTING REFERRALS. EIGHT THANK YOU DOCTOR. AND I THAT IS TO DIRECTOR HAGEN OR CHIEF PARKER. YES THANK YOU YES- GOOD DR GRANT HELLO- THE. THE ELEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR- WHICH IS THE NUMBER I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THE WHICH MAY BE A WITH NO MORE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF- COBIT NINETEEN INSPECTIONS THAT WE'VE DONE RELATES TO- YOU KNOW ALL CATEGORIES OF INSPECTIONS- WHETHER IT'S FROM A COMPLAINT WHETHER IT'S FROM DUE TO A FATALITY ARRANGED FOR ILLNESS- AND SO- THE NUMBER OF. COMPLAINTS WERE COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE RESULTED AN ON SITE INSPECTION IS ACTUALLY. LOWER THAN OUR YOU KNOW I'M A HIGHER RATIO FEWER- THAN TO HELP THEM THE WANTED SIX THAT YOU MENTION- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE. DID AT THEY ARE OUTSIDE OF THIS- IN PREPARATION FOR WHAT WE EXPECTED TO BE AN ONSLAUGHT OF COMPLAINTS WOULD BE TO SET UP A TRIAGE SYSTEM WHERE WE INITIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO COMPLAINTS WITH- NONE EXCEPT IN THE MOST SERIOUS CASES- WITH LETTER INVESTIGATIONS WHICH MEANS THAT WE SENT A LETTER TO THE EMPLOYER TO GATHER EVIDENCE TO GATHER INFORMATION TO GET THEIR RESPONSE AND THEN WHICH WE USE THAT AS A AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION A TRIGE AND THEN WE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER THE- WHETHER THE RESPONSE IS SATISFACTORY WE TRY TO. CONFIRM THAT WITH THE WORKER IF WORKERS MADE A COMPLAINT AND IDENTIFY. A HER OR HIMSELF. AND THEN YOU KNOW PROCEED ON THAT BASIS. THAT WE'VE- YOU KNOW WE'VE RESOLVED ABOUT FOUR OR MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THREE OF A- LETTER INSPECTION PROCESS- WE SENT MORE LETTERS AND THEN A NUMBER OF OTHER ARM CANDY- YEAH THIS WAS A STRATEGY THAT WE- TRANSFER KIND OF BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GONNA GET A- YOU KNOW. IT'S ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGH NUMBER OF FATALITIES AND ILLNESSES THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO INVESTIGATE- WHICH ARE MANDATED BY. THERE'S LEGISLATIVE MANDATE THERE AND- YEAH AND- WE- THOUGHT THAT THE USE OF THESE LETTER INSPECTIONS WERE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS AN IN PERSON INSPECTION. WAS GONNA ALLOW US TO TRIAGE AND THEN REACHED OF MOST WORKERS THAT WE POSSIBLY COULD BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT IF WE DID COMPLAINTS IN THESE- CASES ARE YOU KNOW WE SIMPLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO A- LOTS OF. MOST OF THE MOST OF THEIR COMPLAINTS AND SO THIS WAS A WAY OF MAXIMIZING OUR REACH- IT'S NOT A NEW PROCEDURE WE'VE BEEN DOING. LETTER INSPECTIONS FOR YEARS. WE ACTUALLY DO- FEWER LETTER INSPECTIONS AND FEDERAL OSHA AS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE THAT WE- WHERE WE USE THAT PROCESS. SO I THINK THAT SOME. TELL TO MAYBE I CAN JUST FOLLOW UP YEAH YOU'RE A BRIEFLY- AND YET I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND WE HAD THAT WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT RESOURCES. YOU DO A LETTER INSPECTION AGAIN WE I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE ABOUT THE TIME SENSITIVE NATURE THIS IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IT'S SPREADING EXPONENTIALLY- HELLO WHEN YOU ASK WHEN YOU DO IT. I GUESS A LETTER INVESTIGATION RE SEND THE LETTER SAID PLEASE RESPOND EXPLAINS THE FROM THE EMPLOYER WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH YOU GIVE THE EMPLOYER TO RESPOND AND THEN HOW DO YOU CONFIRM THAT THOSE RESPONSES ARE ACCURATE. SO WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME FOR BOTH THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE EMPLOYER TO RESPOND. AND ALSO YOUR VERIFICATION PROCESS. FOR IT IN A LETTER TO- INVESTIGATION. THAT THAT- WITHOUT WHAT'S BEEN REPLIED TO IS A- I GUESS IS A- CONCURRENT WITH THE WHAT I NEEDED AT WORKPLACE. SO WE GIVE THE EMPLOYER- US THREE DAYS TO RESPOND FOR A SERIOUS VIOLATION AND WE GET FOURTEEN DAYS FOR A GENERAL ARE LESS SERIOUS VIOLATION- AND THEN WE EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE THERE'S TYPICALLY A BACK AND FORTH PHONE CALL PARTICULARLY FOR THE SERIOUS VIOLATION. IF WE HAVE A- IF WE HAVE A COMPLAINANT WHO IS NAMED OFTEN THEIR ANONYMOUS THAT IF WE HAVE A- YOU KNOW FORMAL COMPLAINT FROM UNNAMED COMPLAINANT- WE- OUR PROCEDURES REQUIRE THAT THE INFORMATION BE VERIFIED AND THEN THE- AND THEN-THE EMPLOYER IS REQUIRED TO. POST BOTH OUR LETTER AND THEIR RESPONSE IN THE WORKPLACE SO THAT EMPLOYEES CAN VIEW- BOS AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET FOLLOW UP COMPLAINTS FROM UP FOR WORKERS YASUMI NAME CLERK COMPLIANCE WITH THAT REQUIREMENT. IN IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL TIMING THAT PROCESS. TAKES ABOUT. THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS IS AS OPPOSED TO THE EIGHTY TO NINETY DAYS FOR A TYPICAL INSPECTION AND THE AND SEVENTY DAYS THAT. IS TYPICAL FOR COMPLETION OF A WITH NINETEEN INSPECTION. AND I SHOULD SAY WHEN I SAY SEVENTY DAYS SUMMER QUITE QUICK BECAUSE THEY'RE PART OF SWEEPS. SUMMER LONGER BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE MORE COMPLEX WORKPLACES LIKE HOSPITALS OR CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. THIS IS WHY VARIATION AFTER THAT'S THE AVERAGE OKAY BLOOD PRESSURE YOUR ANSWERS I THINK PERHAPS SAID I KNOW WE HAVE LIMITED TIME HERE SO I'M GONNA STOP HERE BUT- I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON SOME MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT. ABOUT ABOUT THIS AD EXACTLY WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TOO. YEAH EXPECTING THE AVAIL. OF AN INSIGHT TESTING AND ALSO AGAIN I DID CLOSE THE QUESTION BUT NO WILL FOLLOW UP ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND CAL OSHA. BE SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER- TO I TRIED IT BOTH INTENSIFIED BUT THEN ADDRESS WORKPLACE. SAFETY WHEN IT COMES TO COATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHEAPER PRINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR PAN WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR VALUABLE BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE- AND WE DO HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION I BELIEVE FROM ONE OF OUR PANELISTS. ON THE SECOND PANEL- REGISTERED NURSE AMY ARE ARLAND. SO I CAN PASS IT ON TO HER IF SHE'S STILL ON THE LINE. TO ASK A QUESTION. YES I'M HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU MAY PROCEED GO RIGHT AHEAD. BEING INVOLVED AND CALLUM CHAU COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND MY OWN FACILITY I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TIMELINE. LATELY EVERY SINGLE INTERACTION THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH A COUCH INSPECTOR HAS BEEN PRACTICED WITH THE SIX MONTH RULE WE KEEP BEING REMINDED WE HAVE SIX MONTHS TO MAKE A CONCLUSION. WELL LET ME TELL YOU OUR FIRST FATALITY HAPPENED IN MAY THAT NURSE FILED A COMPLAINT HERSELF IN APRIL ABOUT WORKPLACE HAZARDS AND EXPOSURES. WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL% ENGINEERING CONTROL FAILURES THAT WE HAVE RECORDED- AND THE IDEA THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SIX MONTHS TO DRAW A CONCLUSION IN A HEALTH CARE FACILITY THE SIZE OF MINE. ONLY MEANS THAT PATIENTS ARE GOING TO BE AT RISK AND I'M GONNA LOSE MORE CO WORKERS- SO- AS FAR AS PRACTICING EVERY INVESTIGATION WITH THE SIX MONTH TIMELINE. KIND OF SETS THE PACE ESPECIALLY FOR THE HOSPITALS AND THE PEOPLE THERE PROVIDING YOU WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THERE REALLY IS NO RUSH. THAT THERE IS NO HURRY TO WRAP THIS UP AND TO ACTUALLY FIND SOMETHING WRONG I MEAN WE ARE NOT AS NURSES SO MUCH CONCERNED WITH THE MONETARY CITATIONS. AS WE ARE FOR ACTUAL ENFORCEABLE ACTIONS IN THE FACILITIES TO IMPROVE. THE WORKPLACE SAFETY ISSUES- STARTED LIKE YOU TO PLEASE- IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT SIX MONTH. WINDOW FOR ME. THANK YOU AMY. AND I'M I. YES I KNOW I ASKED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER BUT IF WE CAN TOUCH ON THAT SPECIFIC TO HER. COMMENTS THAT WOULD BE GREAT SURE. YOU KNOW I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I'VE ON X. I BEEN CAN THAT WELL- IT'S KIND OF CONFLATION OF THIS ACTUALLY LIMITATIONS WHICH IS THE LEGAL TIME YOU HAVE TO ISSUE A CITATION- AND THINKING OF IT AS A AS. A PERFORMANCE DEADLINE WHICH IS NOT NICE THEY'RE NOT AS THE SAME THING- AND IT'S- AN EIGHT AND EIGHT. IT CAN HAVE A- IT IT CAN COME HOW TO PUT IT A KIND OF. UNDERMINE THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION WITH IF THAT IS THE MINDSET AND SO- I CERTAINLY CAN I TAKE THAT FEEDBACK BACK TO OUR STAFF TOMORROW WHEN I MEET WITH A DISTRICT MANAGERS AND JUST. REMIND THEM OF THAT FACT. SOME OF THESE- SOME OF THESE- YOU KNOW INSPECTIONS ARE TAKING THE TIME THEY DO BECAUSE IT'S A REFLECTION OF. OF WORKLOAD BUT- I DO STE I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WHERE I. WORK INSPECTION CAN JUST BE COMPLETED- YOU KNOW IT IT NEEDS TO BE NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED BY THE WORK STUFF. RATHER THAN THINKING IN TERMS OF THE SIX MONTH TIME FRAME. THANK YOU CHIEF PARKRUN THANK YOU AMY FOR THE QUESTION WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLOSE THIS SECTION AND THEN WE WILL GET ON WE WATCH TO TAKE A SHORT. BRIEF PAUSE TO GET TO OUR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I THINK THERE WERE A FEW THINGS THAT WE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS AS WELL AS OUR WORK FORCE- OF COURSE THE STATE LAB COMING ONLINE IN NOVEMBER AND A PRIORITY FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND- JUST OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS TO BE PRIORITIZE FIRST. SOMEHOW WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. NEW TESTS COMING ONLINE EVERY SINGLE DAY THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE ARE AND SHOULD BE WAITING FOR. THAT EVEN BEING TESTED AT THE HOSPITAL SITE- AND THEN IN SOME CASES WE DO HAVE A DOUBLE CRISES AND THE CASE OF OUR FARMWORKERS BOTH WILDFIRES AND COVERT NINETEEN. SO PERHAPS THERE COULD BE A REASSESSMENT OF. THESE POTENTIAL OF THESE WORKERS SPECIFICALLY AS THEY ARE DEALING WITH- DUE TO THE FARM WORKING THAT THEY DO WITHIN THIS CONTEXT TO FIGHT WILDFIRES AS WELL WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE AND WE DID TALK ABOUT A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO THE INVESTIGATION PERIOD. AND PERHAPS SHORTENING THAT. AS WELL AS AS TO SENATOR PAN'S POINT BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND CAL OSHA. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN TO OUR PANELISTS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BRIEF PAUSE SO WE CAN GET TO A PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION. THANK YOU.

THE GUIDANCES THE NEW STANDARD LIKELY COMING IN NOVEMBER THE HOPEFULLY STRENGTHEN THOSE GUIDANCES ANY EFFORTS TO FIX THE STAFFING US DESCRIBE ODAY'S SOUND REALLY PROMISING. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER HOW FAR AT THIS AGENCY HAD TO GO PART OF THE PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE STAFFING ISSUE THAT 2225% VACANCY RATE HAS PERSISTED FOR. AT LEAST A DECADE THAT WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE ISSUE AND THAT CAUSES A LOT OF DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS THAT REALLY AND WITH WORKERS BEING LESS SAFETY INSPECTORS ARE TO RUSH TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS IT'S ENCOURAGING AN OVER RELIANCE ON LETTER INSPECTIONS AS COVER TODAY THAT. ESSENTIALLY ALLOW EMPLOYERS SECURE THE VIOLATION M. IT'S REALLY HARD TO THINK OF ANY OTHER LAW THAT WORKS THAT WAY ESPECIALLY ONE THAT IS THAT'S CLOSELY RELATED TO YOU SO MANY ILLNESSES AND SO MUCH DEATH AND SOMETHING THAT IS THE SERIOUS. WE REALLY DO THINK THAT THAT STAFFING ISSUE NEEDS TO BE FIXED HOPEFULLY THE CURRENT EFFORTS AS DESCRIBED WILL BE EFFECTIVE- AND THAT WHATEVER THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN OVER THE PREVIOUS YEARS GET ADDRESSED BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE THINK REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED NOT RELATED TO OUR CULTURE.

WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY PREVENTING THE TRANSMISSION OF KOBE NINETEEN IN OUR HOSPITALS. ALL INTERESTS INCLUDING STAFF OR SCREEN FOR FEVER AND SYMPTOMS PRIOR TO ENTERING THE HOSPITAL. STAFF MEMBERS HAVE AN EXPOSURE AND ARE SHOWING SYMPTOMS HOSPITALS PROVIDE TESTING. IT IS ALSO KEY FOR.
