00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:57.709 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT

00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:59.878 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING AS

00:32:57.709 --> 00:33:02.013 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY ON THE FRONTEND.

00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:03.982 region:rollup2
AND THAT WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:06.251 region:rollup2
ON THE FRONT AND WE PAY FOR ON

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:08.453 region:rollup2
THE BACKEND.

00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:10.021 region:rollup2
SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:12.057 region:rollup2
BIT OF INFORMATION.

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:13.325 region:rollup2
TO PROVE AT THIS POINT.

00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:14.826 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY EXCITED.

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:18.129 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE.

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:19.631 region:rollup2
INITIATED A FULL REDESIGN OF

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:21.900 region:rollup2
WHAT USED TO BE KNOWN AS OUR

00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:24.102 region:rollup2
SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.238 region:rollup2
SUMMER SCHOOL USE TO BE A

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:27.372 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT WAS AGAIN FOCUSED

00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:29.841 region:rollup2
ON MAKING SURE THAT MORE

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:32.177 region:rollup2
STUDENTS GRADUATED THOSE THAT

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.878 region:rollup2
WEREN'T ON TRACK TO GRADUATE.

00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:36.147 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE WE KNOW THE

00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:38.216 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF CANDOR READINESS.

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:40.085 region:rollup2
THIRD GRADE READING THIS.

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:41.686 region:rollup2
TRANSITION YEARS OF SIX TO SEVEN

00:33:40.085 --> 00:33:43.989 region:rollup2
EIGHT TO NINE.

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:45.257 region:rollup2
A WE HAVE REDESIGNED OUR SUMMER

00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:47.859 region:rollup2
SCHOOL PROGRAM.

00:33:45.257 --> 00:33:50.395 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON A PHILOSOPHY OF

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:51.796 region:rollup2
OPTING OUT. WHICH MEANS THAT

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:53.598 region:rollup2
WE'VE IDENTIFIED.

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:55.033 region:rollup2
CURRENT CANDOR STUDENTS THAT

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:57.736 region:rollup2
AREN'T ON TRACK TO DEMONSTRATE

00:33:55.033 --> 00:34:00.205 region:rollup2
CANDOR READINESS.

00:33:57.736 --> 00:34:01.840 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE NOW GONE BACK FURTHER

00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:02.908 region:rollup2
AND IDENTIFIED THOSE STUDENTS

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.609 region:rollup2
WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO

00:34:02.908 --> 00:34:06.044 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE CANDOR READINESS WHO

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:08.113 region:rollup2
DID NOT ATTEND AN EARLY LEARNING

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:10.148 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:11.983 region:rollup2
AND ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:13.018 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING DID

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.185 region:rollup2
NOT ATTEND AND EARLY LEARNING

00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:16.221 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:19.257 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:21.726 region:rollup2
AGAIN. WE COULD CHOOSE TO INVEST

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:23.662 region:rollup2
THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE.

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:25.163 region:rollup2
AT THE BACK END TO MAKE SURE

00:34:23.662 --> 00:34:26.064 region:rollup2
MORE STUDENTS GRADUATE BUT WE'VE

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:27.966 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING THAT FOR MANY MANY

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:30.001 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:34:27.966 --> 00:34:31.636 region:rollup2
AND I LIVE ON THE MANTRA THAT

00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:32.771 region:rollup2
EVERY SYSTEM IS PERFECTLY

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:35.373 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO GET US THE RESULTS

00:34:32.771 --> 00:34:37.108 region:rollup2
THAT HE GETS.

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:39.077 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:41.012 region:rollup2
SHIFT THE PARADIGM.

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:42.647 region:rollup2
FOCUS A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:44.649 region:rollup2
ON THE BACK END BUT BEGIN TO

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:46.818 region:rollup2
FOCUS MORE ATTENTION ON THE

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:48.086 region:rollup2
FRONT AND WHICH IS WHY I'M VERY

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:50.755 region:rollup2
PROUD THAT OUR BOARD OF

00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:52.657 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. HAS FULLY COMMITTED

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:54.392 region:rollup2
TO FUND A THIS VERY UNIQUE

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:56.394 region:rollup2
SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT WILL

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:58.396 region:rollup2
SERVE STUDENTS AS EARLY AS

00:34:56.394 --> 00:34:59.965 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN WHO ARE NOT ON

00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:02.267 region:rollup2
GRADE LEVEL.

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:04.402 region:rollup2
GOING INTO FIRST GRADE IN THE

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:06.738 region:rollup2
FALL.

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:09.941 region:rollup2
DUFF HOPPED OUT PHILOSOPHY

00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:12.143 region:rollup2
ENTAILS UP THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:13.979 region:rollup2
HAVE NOW NOTIFIED EVERYONE OF

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:14.512 region:rollup2
THE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OF

00:35:13.979 --> 00:35:16.648 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:17.949 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING AS KINDERGARTENERS.

00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:18.650 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE ESSENTIALLY PRE

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:20.619 region:rollup2
REGISTERED THEM FOR SUMMER

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:23.822 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

00:35:20.619 --> 00:35:26.157 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO DO RECEIVED AN

00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:28.259 region:rollup2
OPT OUT FORM FROM A PARENT OR

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:30.362 region:rollup2
GUARDIAN FOR US NOT TO SEE THE

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:31.696 region:rollup2
STUDENT DURING THE SUMMER.

00:35:30.362 --> 00:35:33.431 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE CONVINCED AND

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:35.200 region:rollup2
COMMITTED THAT TO THE EXTENT

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:38.470 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS START THEIR FALL

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:40.438 region:rollup2
SEMESTER DAY ONE IN THE FALL.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.773 region:rollup2
CLOSER TO GRADE LEVEL READINESS

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:43.508 region:rollup2
GOING INTO KINDERGARTEN AND

00:35:41.773 --> 00:35:44.876 region:rollup2
FIRST GRADE. THAT THAT WILL SAVE

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:46.745 region:rollup2
US.

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:48.613 region:rollup2
A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES BOTH

00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:49.381 region:rollup2
HUMAN AND CAPITAL AS THE

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:52.350 region:rollup2
STUDENTS PROGRESS IN THEIR

00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:54.052 region:rollup2
CAREERS.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.453 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION A LITTLE

00:35:54.052 --> 00:35:56.988 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

00:35:55.453 --> 00:35:58.757 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RADIUS WHICH IS A

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:00.492 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:35:58.757 --> 00:36:01.459 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS HAS

00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:03.128 region:rollup2
INCREASED OVER THE PAST THREE

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:04.863 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:36:03.128 --> 00:36:07.265 region:rollup2
I IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

00:36:04.863 --> 00:36:09.267 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN ARE THE TOTAL AMOUNT

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:11.236 region:rollup2
WE INVESTED WAS TWENTY ONE POINT

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:13.171 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:36:11.236 --> 00:36:15.673 region:rollup2
SERVE JUST SHY OF TWO THOUSAND

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:17.308 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:18.910 region:rollup2
IT WAS TWENTY THREE POINT THREE

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:20.045 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS TO SERVE

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.579 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:36:20.045 --> 00:36:23.615 region:rollup2
THREE STUDENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:25.050 region:rollup2
FEWER STUDENTS.

00:36:23.615 --> 00:36:27.085 region:rollup2
AND IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:28.887 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT COST TO BE ALMOST

00:36:27.085 --> 00:36:31.089 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:32.891 region:rollup2
IN FACT WE ARE SLATED TO INVEST

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:35.427 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM

00:36:32.891 --> 00:36:36.761 region:rollup2
OUR GENERAL FUND. TO COVER THE

00:36:35.427 --> 00:36:38.563 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN COST.

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:40.532 region:rollup2
TO RUN THE SAME LEVEL OF

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:43.368 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING.

00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:45.336 region:rollup2
NOW WE ALSO KNOW THAT.

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:47.238 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A WEIGHT LIST.

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:49.340 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT SACKS CITY UNIFIED

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:52.277 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL. ARE AND

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:55.313 region:rollup2
IT PAINS ME WHEN I LEARNED THAT

00:36:52.277 --> 00:36:57.649 region:rollup2
A STUDENT IS UNABLE BECAUSE OF

00:36:55.313 --> 00:37:00.085 region:rollup2
CAPACITY ISSUES PRIMARILY DUE TO

00:36:57.649 --> 00:37:01.886 region:rollup2
FUNDING. NOT TO ENROLL IN AN

00:37:00.085 --> 00:37:04.055 region:rollup2
EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM GIVEN THE

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:06.491 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE MADE.

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:08.393 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE

00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:09.661 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATING CANDOR READINESS

00:37:08.393 --> 00:37:11.396 region:rollup2
FIRST GRADE READINESS AND THIRD

00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:12.897 region:rollup2
GRADE READING CLASS.

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:14.999 region:rollup2
AND I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:16.468 region:rollup2
THAT FACT THAT IF FIFTY PERCENT

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:18.103 region:rollup2
OF OUR STUDENTS

00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:18.603 region:rollup2
WHO ARE STRUGGLING DID NOT

00:37:18.103 --> 00:37:20.605 region:rollup2
ATTEND AN EARLY LEARNING

IN THE URBAN SETTING MOST OF US

00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:26.444 region:rollup2

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:38.356 region:rollup2
STUDENTS STILL WANTING TO.

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:40.358 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD MUCH PREFER TO SEE

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:42.594 region:rollup2

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.505 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES LIKE CHILDCARE ARE

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:02.507 region:rollup2
AND PRESCHOOL ARE CRITICAL IN A

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:03.107 region:rollup2

PERCENT OF A CHILD'S BRAIN HAS

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:06.444 region:rollup2

00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:08.646 region:rollup2
HAVE A CRISIS OF BOTH ACCESS AND

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:09.881 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY.

00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:11.082 region:rollup2

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:19.023 region:rollup2
FORCING THE PARENTS TO MAKE

00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:19.624 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.992 region:rollup2
THEY LEAVE THEIR CHILDREN WHEN

00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:22.427 region:rollup2
THEY GO TO WORK.

00:39:20.992 --> 00:39:24.195 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDING THAT THE PRICE OF

00:39:22.427 --> 00:39:25.563 region:rollup2
INFANT CARE IN CALIFORNIA COSTS

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:27.098 region:rollup2

WHICH A BARRIER SO HIGH THAT

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.004 region:rollup2
MANY FAMILIES JUST BASS HORRIBLY

00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:34.973 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING DILEMMAS FOR CARE.

00:39:33.004 --> 00:39:36.174 region:rollup2
AND THE PRICE TAG ON CHILDCARE

00:39:34.973 --> 00:39:37.275 region:rollup2
CARRIES EVEN MORE TROUBLING WHEN

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:38.610 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON LOW

00:39:37.275 --> 00:39:39.777 region:rollup2
INCOME FAMILIES.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.079 region:rollup2

POVERTY LEVEL.

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:46.818 region:rollup2
IT WOULD TAKE NINETY FIVE

PERCENT OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME

00:39:46.818 --> 00:39:50.421 region:rollup2
FOR CHILDCARE FOR TWO. WHICH IS

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.389 region:rollup2
JUST UNACCEPTABLE AND

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:53.291 region:rollup2
UNATTAINABLE FOR ALL FAMILIES IN

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:01.599 region:rollup2
WE STAND AT A MOMENT OF

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:08.039 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT SIXTY PERCENT

00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:09.107 region:rollup2

00:40:10.742 --> 00:40:13.645 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

BEACON FOR CHANGE AND PROGRESS

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:25.923 region:rollup2
OFTEN THE EXAMPLE THAT OTHERS

COMMITMENT TO OUR YOUNGEST KIDS

00:40:27.692 --> 00:40:30.928 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ALWAYS LEAD THE WAY.

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:32.196 region:rollup2
EVEN OUR ECONOMY RANKS SIXTH

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.164 region:rollup2

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:51.322 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. PUT TOGETHER BY THE

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:53.291 region:rollup2
NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AND

00:44:51.322 --> 00:44:54.859 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE TO

00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:56.127 region:rollup2
CONDUCT THE STUDY.

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:57.962 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A NATIONAL EFFORT TO

00:44:56.127 --> 00:44:59.597 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE FINANCING FOR EARLY

00:44:57.962 --> 00:45:01.832 region:rollup2
CARE AND EDUCATION BUT I THINK

00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:03.301 region:rollup2
MANY OF BOTH THE FINDINGS AND

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:03.768 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE RELEVANCE

00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:09.106 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR WORK HERE IN

00:45:03.768 --> 00:45:10.174 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:12.376 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:14.111 region:rollup2
THAT THIS STUDY WAS SPONSORED BY

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:15.846 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:17.315 region:rollup2
ENTITIES AND I THINK IT SPEAKS

00:45:15.846 --> 00:45:19.550 region:rollup2
TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS. AN

00:45:17.315 --> 00:45:20.818 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT IS DEEPLY RELEVANT

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.453 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:23.321 region:rollup2
BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:26.924 region:rollup2
AS WELL FOR STATES AND

00:45:23.321 --> 00:45:27.959 region:rollup2
LOCALITIES.

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:29.560 region:rollup2
THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:30.861 region:rollup2
STUDIES ALWAYS BEGIN WITH A

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.129 region:rollup2
STATEMENT OF TASK AND I JUST

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:33.497 region:rollup2
WANT TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THAT

00:45:32.129 --> 00:45:35.866 region:rollup2
THIS EFFORT.

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:38.502 region:rollup2
BY OUR COMMITTEE WAS DESIGNED

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:40.037 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF

00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:42.106 region:rollup2
FINANCING FOR EARLY CARE AND

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:43.808 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN FROM

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:45.176 region:rollup2
BIRTH TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY.

00:45:43.808 --> 00:45:47.345 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT EARLY CARE AND

00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:48.813 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE

00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:50.414 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE TO FAMILIES AND OF

00:45:48.813 --> 00:45:51.916 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY?

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:53.217 region:rollup2
AND DELIVERED BY A WELL

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:54.652 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED IN ADEQUATELY

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:56.254 region:rollup2

WORKFORCE

00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:59.190 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE VISION AND

00:45:57.989 --> 00:46:01.225 region:rollup2
AN EARLIER NATIONAL ACADEMY

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.693 region:rollup2

BIRTH TO EIGHT.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:09.433 region:rollup2
SO ALL THAT STUDY SPECIFICALLY

00:46:07.565 --> 00:46:10.868 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THE WORK FORCE FROM

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:11.969 region:rollup2

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:13.471 region:rollup2
THIS STUDY IS GOING TO BE

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:17.475 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TWO CHILDREN PRIOR TO

00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:19.844 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN ENTRY.

00:46:17.475 --> 00:46:20.778 region:rollup2
THE VISION ON THE PART OF THOSE

00:46:19.844 --> 00:46:21.679 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE THAT PRODUCE THE

00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:23.247 region:rollup2

00:46:26.017 --> 00:46:28.919 region:rollup2
IN THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.187 region:rollup2
SETTING.

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:32.390 region:rollup2
ACQUIRED HIGH QUALITY

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:33.791 region:rollup2

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:39.563 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS AS WELL AS THE

00:46:37.428 --> 00:46:40.498 region:rollup2
LEADERS AND. THE SETTINGS WHERE

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:42.099 region:rollup2
THEY DELIVER EARLY CARE AND

00:46:40.498 --> 00:46:43.167 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:45.169 region:rollup2
PRACTICE ENVIRONMENTS AND

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:45.770 region:rollup2
WORKING CONDITIONS THAT PROVIDE

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:46.937 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS NEEDED

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.105 region:rollup2
TO

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:50.474 region:rollup2
PORT THE WELL BEING OF

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:52.209 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS IN THE C. FEEL. AS

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:53.611 region:rollup2
WELL AS SUPPORT OF POLICIES FOR

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:55.079 region:rollup2

00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:57.048 region:rollup2
PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT.

00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:59.250 region:rollup2
SO WITH THOSE UNDERLYING VISION

00:46:57.048 --> 00:47:00.718 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT TO HIGH QUALITY WELL

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.553 region:rollup2
COMPENSATED WORKFORCE WOULD LOOK

00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:03.788 region:rollup2
LIKE. OUR TASK WAS ESSENTIALLY

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:04.755 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT WHAT THE COST WOULD

00:47:03.788 --> 00:47:06.691 region:rollup2
BE.

00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:08.325 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE A SYSTEM THAT

00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:10.094 region:rollup2
DELIVERED EARLY CARE AND

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:12.363 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BIRTH TO KINDERGARTEN

00:47:10.094 --> 00:47:14.632 region:rollup2
ENTRY AS WELL AS TO THINK ABOUT

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:16.667 region:rollup2
ISSUES FOR HOW ONE WOULD FIND

00:47:14.632 --> 00:47:19.070 region:rollup2
THAT SYSTEM. AND THE MECHANISMS

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:20.838 region:rollup2
BY WHICH ANY RESOURCES REYES TO

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:23.541 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD BE

00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:25.276 region:rollup2
DELIVERED.

00:47:23.541 --> 00:47:26.610 region:rollup2
SO WHAT TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT

00:47:25.276 --> 00:47:28.345 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY TO CONSENT THE STATE

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.613 region:rollup2
FOR EFFORT.

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:32.249 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL BY EARLY CARE AND

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:34.518 region:rollup2
EDUCATION I'M REFERRING TO PAID

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:36.220 region:rollup2
NON PARENTAL CARE AND EDUCATION

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:38.622 region:rollup2
PROVIDED OUTSIDE THE HOME FOR

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.191 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. INCLUDING CHILD CARE

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:41.726 region:rollup2
AND EARLY LEARNING SETTINGS.

00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:42.893 region:rollup2
ACROSS THAT ZERO TO

00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:44.161 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN INTERFERE EIGHT

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:46.564 region:rollup2
FIVE SPECTRUM.

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:48.265 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS INTENDED TO COVER THE

00:47:46.564 --> 00:47:50.067 region:rollup2
PAID CARE THAT'S RECEIVED IN

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:51.836 region:rollup2
BOTH CENTER BASED SETTINGS AS

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:53.571 region:rollup2
WELL AS HOME BASED SETTINGS.

00:47:51.836 --> 00:47:54.872 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE TALK

00:47:53.571 --> 00:47:56.507 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE WORK FORCE IN THOSE

00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:58.943 region:rollup2
SETTINGS WERE REFERRING TO THE

00:47:56.507 --> 00:48:00.411 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS THEMSELVES WORKING

00:47:58.943 --> 00:48:02.446 region:rollup2
AND HOME ON SATURDAY SETTING

00:48:00.411 --> 00:48:04.148 region:rollup2
SUCH AS EDUCATORS. LEAD TEACHERS

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:05.883 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THEIR ASSISTANCE OF

00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:07.518 region:rollup2
AIDS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATORS

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:08.986 region:rollup2
IN THOSE SETTINGS SUCH AS

00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:10.187 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:11.455 region:rollup2
THE WORKFORCE AND THE

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:13.290 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:14.725 region:rollup2
COACHES AND MENTORS.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.693 region:rollup2
AND THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:17.361 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:19.096 region:rollup2
THIRTY THOUSAND CENTERS THAT

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:20.464 region:rollup2
PROVIDE CARE FOR CHILDREN FROM

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:21.866 region:rollup2
BIRTH TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY.

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:25.469 region:rollup2
WITHIN THOSE CENTERS ARE ABOUT A

00:48:21.866 --> 00:48:27.171 region:rollup2
MILLION PAY YOU SEE WORKFORCE

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:29.273 region:rollup2
MEMBERS AND ADDITIONAL MILLION

00:48:27.171 --> 00:48:31.375 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF EASY WORKFORCE

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:32.743 region:rollup2
PROVIDE CARE. ON AN EARLY

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:34.812 region:rollup2
LEARNING AND HOME BASED SETTINGS

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:36.747 region:rollup2
SO ARE STUDIES INTENDED TO APPLY

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:37.615 region:rollup2
TO THOSE APPROXIMATELY TWO

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:39.550 region:rollup2
MILLION PRACTITIONERS IN THE

00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:40.551 region:rollup2
FIELD. PROVIDING PAID CARE

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.486 region:rollup2
THROUGH HOME AND CENTER BASED

00:48:40.551 --> 00:48:44.054 region:rollup2
SETTINGS.

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:45.122 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TERM THAT I WANTED TO

00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:46.690 region:rollup2
FINE IS.

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:48.192 region:rollup2
WHAT WE REFER TO AS FINANCING

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:49.693 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS

00:48:48.192 --> 00:48:51.829 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE METHODS BY WHICH

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:53.397 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:55.232 region:rollup2
ENTITIES STAKEHOLDERS IF YOU

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:57.701 region:rollup2
WELL IN THE SYSTEM WHETHER THEY

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:59.336 region:rollup2
BE PROVIDERS? OR FAMILIES THE

00:48:57.701 --> 00:49:01.172 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE OR THE SYSTEM AS A

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:03.073 region:rollup2
WHOLE SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE

00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:04.742 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT FUNDING MECHANISMS

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:05.810 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PROVIDER ORIENTED. IT

00:49:04.742 --> 00:49:07.378 region:rollup2
MEANS MECHANISM SUCH AS

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.779 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS ARE GRANTS WHERE THE

00:49:07.378 --> 00:49:10.381 region:rollup2
FUNDING COMES DIRECTLY TO

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:12.316 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS HEAD START BEING

00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:13.751 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:15.486 region:rollup2
TOTAL FIVE PROGRAMS.

00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:17.021 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MECHANISMS

00:49:15.486 --> 00:49:18.422 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ORIENTED TOWARDS FAMILY

00:49:17.021 --> 00:49:20.357 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE CASES WHERE YOU WOULD

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:21.859 region:rollup2
HAVE VOUCHERS OR TAX BASE

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:23.260 region:rollup2
PREFERENCES SO THAT FAMILIES ARE

00:49:21.859 --> 00:49:24.728 region:rollup2
THE RECIPIENTS.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.597 region:rollup2
IF YOU WILL OF THAT THE.

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:28.032 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY TO PAY FOR EARLY CARE

00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:29.133 region:rollup2
AND EDUCATION.

00:49:28.032 --> 00:49:30.468 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALSO EXAMPLES OF

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:31.602 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS THAT ARE DIRECTED TO

00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:32.736 region:rollup2
THE WORK FORCE.

00:49:31.602 --> 00:49:34.238 region:rollup2
SUCH AS.

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:35.806 region:rollup2
VARIOUS KINDS OF GRANTS ARE

00:49:34.238 --> 00:49:36.373 region:rollup2
STIPENDS THAT MAY BE USED TO

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:39.009 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THEIR PROFESSIONAL

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:42.379 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS TARGETED.

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:42.379 region:rollup2
PAY INSIDE OF SUCH AS WAGE

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:46.050 region:rollup2
GIVEN LEVEL OF EDUCATION. AND

00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:47.351 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WIDE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:49.353 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS THAT ARE DIRECTED

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:50.921 region:rollup2
SUPPORT LARGER SYSTEM EFFORTS

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:53.224 region:rollup2
LIKE QUALITY RATING IMPROVEMENTS

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:55.826 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS DATA SYSTEMS AND SO ON

00:49:53.224 --> 00:49:56.393 region:rollup2
THAT AFFECT THE ENTIRE. I'M ECT

SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN IN THESE

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:58.929 region:rollup2
AGES.

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:00.464 region:rollup2
ONLY THINK ABOUT THE

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:01.899 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPING.

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:03.901 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE PRINT CONCERT

00:50:01.899 --> 00:50:05.202 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN TERMS OF EARLY CARE

00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:07.171 region:rollup2
AND EDUCATION AND FINANCING.

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:09.039 region:rollup2
AS I KNOW YOU ARE WELL VERSED

00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:11.342 region:rollup2
IN THESE ISSUES NOW WE HAVE A

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:13.911 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT HAS OF MULTIPLE

00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:15.946 region:rollup2
SOURCES. OF FUNDS RAISED AT THE

00:50:13.911 --> 00:50:17.648 region:rollup2
FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:19.283 region:rollup2
THROUGH SEPARATE PROGRAMS WHERE

00:50:17.648 --> 00:50:21.418 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS OFTEN HAVE

00:50:19.283 --> 00:50:21.919 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STANDARDS WITH RESPECT

QUALITY ELIGIBILITY.

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:27.725 region:rollup2
WHICH TYPES OF PROVIDERS CAN

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:29.026 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS OF ITS

00:50:27.725 --> 00:50:30.628 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ORIENTED.

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:31.962 region:rollup2
AND A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH

00:50:30.628 --> 00:50:33.898 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM TODAY IS EXTREMELY

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:34.798 region:rollup2
COMPLEX.

00:50:33.898 --> 00:50:37.101 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION.

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:38.302 region:rollup2
FUNDING COMES NOT ONLY FROM THE

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:39.737 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SECTOR BUT FAMILIES

00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:41.539 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE AS WELL AND BY OUR

00:50:39.737 --> 00:50:42.740 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE NATIONALLY FAMILIES ARE

00:50:41.539 --> 00:50:44.475 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING ABOUT FIFTY TWO

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:46.777 region:rollup2
PERCENT. OF THE COST OF

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:47.745 region:rollup2
PROVIDING EASY FOR CHILDREN FROM

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:49.246 region:rollup2
BIRTH OUGHT TO KINDERGARTEN

00:50:47.745 --> 00:50:50.414 region:rollup2
ENTRY.

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:51.615 region:rollup2
I THINK ANOTHER THING TO POINT

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:52.917 region:rollup2
OUT TERMS OF FAMILIES

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:54.485 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS THE DATA WE

00:50:52.917 --> 00:50:56.520 region:rollup2
EXAMINE AND REPORT ON IN OUR

00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:57.254 region:rollup2
REPORT. SO THAT THE LOWEST

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.456 region:rollup2
INCOME FAMILIES.

00:50:57.254 --> 00:51:00.858 region:rollup2
WHO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD ECT WHEN

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:02.259 region:rollup2
THEY DO SO?

00:51:00.858 --> 00:51:03.928 region:rollup2
IT'S TYPICALLY A HIGHER SHARE OF

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:05.396 region:rollup2
THEIR INCOME COMPARED TO HIGHER

00:51:03.928 --> 00:51:07.464 region:rollup2
INCOME FAMILIES AND OTHER WORDS

00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:09.033 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN IS GREATEST ON THOSE

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:11.035 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD.

00:51:09.033 --> 00:51:11.602 region:rollup2
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF

00:51:11.035 --> 00:51:14.572 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND

00:51:11.602 --> 00:51:16.240 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

00:51:14.572 --> 00:51:17.775 region:rollup2
IN DOING OUR WORK OF THE

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.510 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WE ESTABLISHED A SET

00:51:17.775 --> 00:51:21.078 region:rollup2
OF PRINCIPLES FOR HIGH QUALITY

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.846 region:rollup2
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION.

00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:24.014 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PROVIDE A FOUNDATION

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:25.816 region:rollup2
FOR US BOTH TO EXAMINE THE

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:27.217 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM IDENTIFY WHERE

00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:28.752 region:rollup2
THERE WERE GAPS OR SHORTFALLS

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:29.687 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO GUIDE A SET OF

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.521 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ALL TALK

00:51:29.687 --> 00:51:32.122 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:51:30.521 --> 00:51:33.657 region:rollup2
THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT LATER WE

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:35.693 region:rollup2
ALSO VIEW THESE PRINCIPLES AT

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:37.127 region:rollup2
ONCE AS ONE TO THE RELEVANT FOR

00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:38.462 region:rollup2
OTHER ENTITIES AN UNDERTAKING

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:39.830 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE DID ON

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:40.698 region:rollup2
OUR COMMITTEE. TRYING TO

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:42.766 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE COST OF THE

00:51:40.698 --> 00:51:43.367 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND HOW ONE WOULD PAY FOR

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.802 region:rollup2
IT.

00:51:43.367 --> 00:51:46.003 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK THESE MAY BE

00:51:44.802 --> 00:51:48.606 region:rollup2
RELEVANT FOR YOUR WORK AND

00:51:46.003 --> 00:51:49.707 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT ON THE OBJECTIVES

00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:50.641 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

00:51:49.707 --> 00:51:53.677 region:rollup2
I'LL SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT.

00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:55.579 region:rollup2
THE SIX PRINCIPLES.

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:57.147 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PRINCIPLE SAYS THAT

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:59.283 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY EASY REQUIRES A

00:51:57.147 --> 00:52:01.118 region:rollup2
DIVERSE CONFIDENT EFFECTIVE WELL

00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:03.053 region:rollup2
COMPENSATED AND PROFESSIONALLY

00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:04.121 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED WORKFORCE ACROSS THE

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:05.756 region:rollup2
VARIOUS ROLES OF THE E. C. E.

00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:08.158 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS.

00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:09.727 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM FAILS TO MEET THIS

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:10.628 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE IN SEVERAL WAYS.

00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:12.129 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL.

00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:13.197 region:rollup2
AS I'M SURE YOUR WORK AS SHOWN

00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:15.599 region:rollup2
IN THE WORK THAT WE DID ON OUR

00:52:13.197 --> 00:52:17.167 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE SHOWS COMPENSATION FOR

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:18.569 region:rollup2
EASY PRACTITIONERS IS LOW.

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:19.803 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S TRUE WHETHER WE'RE

00:52:18.569 --> 00:52:21.572 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS WITH

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.873 region:rollup2
BACHELOR'S DEGREES.

00:52:21.572 --> 00:52:24.274 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THOSE WHO PUT PLAY

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:26.176 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE ROLES ON THOSE IN

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:27.945 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP ROLES. AND THAT'S A

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:29.947 region:rollup2
DRAWBACK IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY

00:52:27.945 --> 00:52:31.515 region:rollup2
TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THAT

00:52:29.947 --> 00:52:33.484 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED IN ORDER

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:35.252 region:rollup2
TO DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY.

00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:37.221 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CHILDREN.

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:38.322 region:rollup2
SECOND OF ALL THE CURRENT WORK

00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:40.724 region:rollup2
FORCE ORIENTED FINANCING

00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:42.493 region:rollup2
MECHANISM SUCH AS THE KINDS OF

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:44.495 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS THE CALIFORNIA HAS HAD.

00:52:42.493 --> 00:52:45.963 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE THOSE.

00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:47.631 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT HAVE A BACHELOR'S

00:52:45.963 --> 00:52:48.632 region:rollup2
DEGREE FOR EXAMPLE TO GO BACK TO

00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:50.668 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:52.436 region:rollup2
THOSE FINANCING MECHANISMS DO

00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:54.071 region:rollup2
NOT CREATE PREDICTABLE AND STUDY

00:52:52.436 --> 00:52:55.706 region:rollup2
SOURCES

00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:57.675 region:rollup2
TO EITHER BOOST THE SALARIES.

00:52:55.706 --> 00:52:59.810 region:rollup2
OF THE LOAD COMPENSATED

00:52:57.675 --> 00:53:01.879 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN THE FIELD AS WELL

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.080 region:rollup2
AS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THEM.

00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:04.615 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE BILL THAT HIGH

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.016 region:rollup2
QUALITY WORKFORCE

00:53:04.615 --> 00:53:08.052 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY WHERE WE HAVE

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:09.586 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ONGOING

00:53:08.052 --> 00:53:11.288 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:12.456 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES THOSE

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.724 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE THROUGH

00:53:12.456 --> 00:53:15.959 region:rollup2
THE UPON THE RATING IMPROVEMENTS

00:53:13.724 --> 00:53:18.128 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL.

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:19.830 region:rollup2
FOR COACHING MENTORS AND SO ON

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:20.330 region:rollup2
THOSE SUPPORTS ARE ALSO ONES

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:22.533 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:23.767 region:rollup2
ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE PROVIDED ON

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:25.636 region:rollup2
A LIMITED BASIS SO AGAIN THEY

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:27.204 region:rollup2
DON'T NOT REACH THE. ENTIRE

00:53:25.636 --> 00:53:28.939 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE IN A WAY THAT.

00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:31.341 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGES A BELT THAT HIGH

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:32.543 region:rollup2
QUALITY WORKFORCE.

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:34.511 region:rollup2
THE SECOND PRINCIPLE STATES THAT

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:36.080 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY EASY REQUIRES ALL%

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:38.315 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TO HAVE

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.951 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO AFFORDABLE

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:42.453 region:rollup2
EASY ESERVICES ACROSS ALL ETHNIC

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:44.655 region:rollup2
RACIAL SOCIO ECONOMIC AND

00:53:42.453 --> 00:53:46.256 region:rollup2
ABILITY STATUSES AS WELL AS

00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:47.858 region:rollup2
ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS.

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:49.159 region:rollup2
AGAIN OUR CURRENT FINANCING

00:53:47.858 --> 00:53:50.694 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE FEELS TO ACHIEVE ON

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:52.129 region:rollup2
THE SUBJECT OF.

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:54.098 region:rollup2
I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THAT

00:53:52.129 --> 00:53:55.499 region:rollup2
FAMILIES CURRENTLY PAY FOR ABOUT

00:53:54.098 --> 00:53:57.267 region:rollup2
FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF THE TOTAL

00:53:55.499 --> 00:53:58.802 region:rollup2
COST OF THE CD. AND FAMILIES

00:53:57.267 --> 00:54:00.137 region:rollup2
WITH THE LOWEST INCOME SPEND

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:02.005 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THEIR

00:54:00.137 --> 00:54:03.240 region:rollup2
INCOME ON THAT CARE AND EARLY

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:05.309 region:rollup2
LEARNING WELL FAMILIES AT THE

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.843 region:rollup2
HIGHEST INCOME LEVELS PAY ONLY

00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:06.610 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIX PERCENT OF THEIR

00:54:05.843 --> 00:54:08.078 region:rollup2
INCOME.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:10.547 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THIS INVERTED SYSTEM

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:11.148 region:rollup2
OF FAMILIES LEAST ABLE TO PAY

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:12.483 region:rollup2
PAYING A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR

00:54:11.148 --> 00:54:13.717 region:rollup2
INCOME.

00:54:12.483 --> 00:54:16.386 region:rollup2
EVEN FOR FAMILIES WHEN THEY

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:17.621 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED UC'S SUCH

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:20.124 region:rollup2
AS THEIR HEAD START OR IN

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:22.092 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS

00:54:20.124 --> 00:54:23.961 region:rollup2
OR SUBSIDIZE CHILDCARE.

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:24.795 region:rollup2
THOSE FAMILIES ARE NOT BUT NOT

00:54:23.961 --> 00:54:26.196 region:rollup2
ALL FAMILIES WHO WOULD BE

00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:27.231 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:29.399 region:rollup2
ABLE TO RECEIVE.

00:54:27.231 --> 00:54:31.401 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THE FUNDING

00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:34.004 region:rollup2
SIMPLY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:35.172 region:rollup2
SERVE ALL FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY.

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:36.907 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY THE LACK OF%

00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:38.308 region:rollup2
HARMONIZATION ACROSS DIFFERENT

00:54:36.907 --> 00:54:39.743 region:rollup2
FUNDING MECHANISMS WHETHER WE'RE

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:41.545 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HEAD START. STATE

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:43.013 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

00:54:41.545 --> 00:54:45.215 region:rollup2
AND OTHER STATE FUNDING SUCH AS

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:45.415 region:rollup2
TITLE FIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:46.717 region:rollup2
THOSE.

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:49.486 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS.

00:54:46.717 --> 00:54:51.622 region:rollup2
LEAD TO GAP IN AFFORDABILITY

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:52.990 region:rollup2
FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AS WELL

00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:54.324 region:rollup2
AS UNDER UTILIZATION BY MIDDLE

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:55.993 region:rollup2
INCOME FAMILIES MANY OF WHOM

00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:57.161 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT QUALIFY BUT STILL FACE

00:54:55.993 --> 00:54:58.962 region:rollup2
THE SAME ISSUES ABOUT

00:54:57.161 --> 00:54:59.530 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY. AND THE ACCESS TO

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:04.234 region:rollup2
EASY.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:05.502 region:rollup2
.

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:06.803 region:rollup2
THE THIRD THROUGH SIXTH UP

00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:07.671 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN GOING

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:09.573 region:rollup2
INTO DETAIL I JUST WANT TO

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:12.109 region:rollup2
EMPHASIZE. THAT EFFECTIVELY THEY

00:55:09.573 --> 00:55:13.744 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO ENSURING ACCESS TO HIGH

00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:15.412 region:rollup2
QUALITY CARE AND A RANGE OF

00:55:13.744 --> 00:55:17.347 region:rollup2
SETTINGS.

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:19.516 region:rollup2
AND HERE IN PARTICULAR THE

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:21.151 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES FOCUS ON THE NEED FOR

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:23.253 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE AND SUSTAINABLE

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:24.388 region:rollup2
FINANCING WITH INCENTIVES.

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:26.123 region:rollup2
EQUALITY AND LOVE THE WORDS

00:55:24.388 --> 00:55:27.491 region:rollup2
LINKING FINANCING TO HIGH

00:55:26.123 --> 00:55:28.992 region:rollup2
QUALITY.

00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:30.360 region:rollup2
FINANCING FOR A VARIETY OF

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:31.028 region:rollup2
SERVICE DELIVERY OPTIONS THAT

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.696 region:rollup2
MEANS.

00:55:31.028 --> 00:55:34.097 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:36.066 region:rollup2
MIXED DELIVERY SUCH A CENTER

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:37.201 region:rollup2
BASED AND HOME BASED SETTINGS.

00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:39.703 region:rollup2
AN ADEQUATE FINANCING FOR

00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:41.104 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AND FOR THE SYSTEM

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:42.639 region:rollup2
LEVEL SUPPORTS THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:43.707 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE OFTEN NEGLECTED

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:45.542 region:rollup2
ASPECTS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:46.843 region:rollup2
FINANCING FOR ASSIST.

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:48.345 region:rollup2
AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM AGAIN

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:50.214 region:rollup2
FAILS TO MEET THESE REMAINING

00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:52.316 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES IN SEVERAL WAYS.

00:55:50.214 --> 00:55:54.952 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL PROCEED A FINDING

00:55:52.316 --> 00:55:56.520 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY IS NOT TIED TO QUALITY

00:55:54.952 --> 00:55:59.723 region:rollup2
MANY OF OUR FUNDING STREAMS.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.024 region:rollup2
ARE NOT EXPECTING FAMILIES TO

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:02.860 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO USE THEM IN HIGH

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:03.894 region:rollup2
QUALITY SETTINGS OR LINK THE

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.895 region:rollup2
RECEIPT OF.

00:56:03.894 --> 00:56:07.130 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

00:56:04.895 --> 00:56:09.099 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT FOR CARE TO THE

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:10.467 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF THE OF THE PROVIDER

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:11.501 region:rollup2
THE SETTING.

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:13.403 region:rollup2
SECOND WHILE THE LEVEL OF

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:14.838 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT IS PROVIDED TO

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:16.273 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WHETHER WE'RE TALKING

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:17.674 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOME OR CENTER BASED

00:56:16.273 --> 00:56:19.209 region:rollup2
SETTINGS IS TYPICALLY NOT

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:20.577 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:23.080 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY.

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:24.348 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IF A PROVIDER HAS A

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.949 region:rollup2
FUNDING MECHANISM THAT'S

00:56:24.348 --> 00:56:27.985 region:rollup2
ORIENTED TOWARD DEMOCRATIC

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:29.820 region:rollup2
CONTRACT FAMILIES HAVE VOUCHERS

00:56:27.985 --> 00:56:31.255 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR CARE OFTEN THE

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.023 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO SET

00:56:31.255 --> 00:56:34.358 region:rollup2
THROUGH THOSE MECHANISMS THAT

00:56:33.023 --> 00:56:36.360 region:rollup2
ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER.

00:56:34.358 --> 00:56:36.994 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF HIGH QUALITY.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.263 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY.

00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:40.998 region:rollup2
IN MANY RESPECTS WE DON'T HAVE

00:56:39.263 --> 00:56:43.033 region:rollup2
FINANCING OR FUNDING STREAMS

00:56:40.998 --> 00:56:44.234 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORT THE SYSTEM LEVEL.

00:56:43.033 --> 00:56:45.903 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:47.971 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT AND

00:56:45.903 --> 00:56:49.473 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND DATA AND

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:51.441 region:rollup2
OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE SEE THAT

00:56:49.473 --> 00:56:53.110 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SYSTEM LEVEL ON HIGH

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:54.544 region:rollup2
QUALITY SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:57.547 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO FAMILIES AND A WELL

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:58.815 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED WORKFORCE.

00:56:57.547 --> 00:57:00.484 region:rollup2
SO ANOTHER OBJECTIVE.

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:02.552 region:rollup2
FOR OUR COMMITTEE WAS TO

00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:04.788 region:rollup2
DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:05.289 region:rollup2
OF DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY CD

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.991 region:rollup2
WITH A WELL COMPENSATED

00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:09.660 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE. AT A NATIONAL LEVEL

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:10.694 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.896 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESS.

00:57:10.694 --> 00:57:13.530 region:rollup2
OR OUR PARTICULAR NUMBERS

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:15.599 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:16.900 region:rollup2
THEY WERE DEVELOPED TO BE A

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:19.036 region:rollup2
NATIONAL ESTIMATE RATHER ONES

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.270 region:rollup2
CIVIC TO CALIFORNIA. BUT I THINK

00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:22.172 region:rollup2
THE EXERCISE THAT WE WENT

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.874 region:rollup2
THROUGH PROVIDED SOME IMPORTANT

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:26.009 region:rollup2
FINDING SO I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT.

00:57:23.874 --> 00:57:27.411 region:rollup2
AND ALSO TO INDICATE THAT THE

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:28.946 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT WE USE.

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:30.714 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THE APPROACHES THE

00:57:28.946 --> 00:57:32.416 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS ARE ONE THE AT A

00:57:30.714 --> 00:57:33.850 region:rollup2
STATE OR LOCAL LEVEL COULD BE

00:57:32.416 --> 00:57:35.752 region:rollup2
REPLICATED TO SEE WHAT THE

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:37.554 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE.

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:39.256 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE NATIONAL LEVEL.

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:40.624 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

00:57:39.256 --> 00:57:42.626 region:rollup2
ESTIMATING THE COST FOR HIGH

00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:43.894 region:rollup2
QUALITY ECT AT A NATIONAL LEVEL

00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:45.796 region:rollup2
WE HAD SEVERAL OBJECTIVES ONE

00:57:43.894 --> 00:57:47.631 region:rollup2
WAS TO ACCOUNT. NOT ONLY FOR ON

00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:49.299 region:rollup2
SITE BECAUSE OF THE COST OF A

00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:50.767 region:rollup2
PROVIDER WHETHER TO CENTER HOME

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.968 region:rollup2
BASE SETTINGS. BUT ALSO TO

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:52.903 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR THE SYSTEM WHITE

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:54.104 region:rollup2
BECAUSE

00:57:52.903 --> 00:57:56.073 region:rollup2
I'M INTO YOU CAN SEE ON THIS

00:57:54.104 --> 00:57:56.940 region:rollup2
CHART THE KINDS OF ON SITE COSTS

00:57:56.073 --> 00:57:59.576 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.578 region:rollup2
CAPTURE. SO STAFFING AS A MAJOR

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:02.612 region:rollup2
COST ELEMENT IN PROVIDING ECT

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:04.748 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO.

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:05.816 region:rollup2
TYING THAT TO ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

00:58:04.748 --> 00:58:06.984 region:rollup2
STAFF QUALITY AND THEIR

00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:09.086 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION.

00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:10.787 region:rollup2
OTHER ONGOING PROFESSIONAL

00:58:09.086 --> 00:58:12.556 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORTS.

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:14.291 region:rollup2
THE FACILITIES THEMSELVES FOR

00:58:12.556 --> 00:58:15.559 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE AND THAT AT THE SYSTEM

00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:17.394 region:rollup2
LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE

00:58:15.559 --> 00:58:18.228 region:rollup2
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WORKFORCE

00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:19.730 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:21.131 region:rollup2
QUALITY ASSURANCE AND

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:22.799 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT SYSTEMS DATA SYSTEMS

00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:23.967 region:rollup2
AND SO ON. SO AGAIN THE GOAL IS

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:25.502 region:rollup2
TO BE.

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:27.437 region:rollup2
AS COMPREHENSIVE AS POSSIBLE

00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:28.805 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO WANTED TO TIE OUR

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:30.307 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES TO.

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:31.375 region:rollup2
THE FINDINGS OF THE

00:58:30.307 --> 00:58:33.677 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMING THE WORK FORCE

00:58:31.375 --> 00:58:35.445 region:rollup2
REPORT IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING.

00:58:33.677 --> 00:58:37.080 region:rollup2
TYPE OF HIGH QUALITY STAFF THAT

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:38.749 region:rollup2
WE WERE IN VISIONING AS WELL AS

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.384 region:rollup2
THE COMPENSATION TO GO WITH IT.

00:58:38.749 --> 00:58:42.586 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

00:58:40.384 --> 00:58:43.920 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT WE ASSUME THAT OUR

00:58:42.586 --> 00:58:45.188 region:rollup2
SETTINGS THAT WE WOULD HAVE LEAD

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.590 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS WITH A BACHELOR'S

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:47.891 region:rollup2
DEGREE AS.

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:49.693 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE TRANSFORMING

00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:51.461 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT THOSE EDUCATORS

00:58:49.693 --> 00:58:53.196 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE ONGOING PROFESSIONAL

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:54.931 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:56.500 region:rollup2
THREE RESOURCES FOR COACHING

00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:57.801 region:rollup2
MENTORING AND SO ON.

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.603 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF

00:58:57.801 --> 00:59:00.871 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE PAID RELEASE TIME TO

00:58:59.603 --> 00:59:02.439 region:rollup2
ALLOW THEM TO ENGAGE IN THIS

00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:03.940 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:05.776 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE RESOURCES

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:07.544 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL

00:59:05.776 --> 00:59:08.412 region:rollup2
NEEDS AND HOME SATURDAY SETTINGS

00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:11.114 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

00:59:08.412 --> 00:59:12.682 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WOULD HAVE NON CHILD

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:14.317 region:rollup2
CONTACT TIME THAT WOULD BE USE

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:15.819 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE FOR PLANNING FOR

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:17.387 region:rollup2
SUSPECTS OF CHILDREN FOR MEETING

00:59:15.819 --> 00:59:18.588 region:rollup2
WITH PARENTS WAYS IN WHICH THEY

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:21.425 region:rollup2
WERE SUPPORTED THAN THOSE

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:22.659 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES.

00:59:21.425 --> 00:59:23.894 region:rollup2
WE DID COME UP WITH THE NUMBER

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:25.529 region:rollup2
OF SO FOR THOSE OF YOU MAY HAVE

00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:26.630 region:rollup2
SEEN THE REPORT OUR ESTIMATE

00:59:25.529 --> 00:59:28.698 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY FOR THE U. S. ON AN

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:30.167 region:rollup2
ANNUAL BASIS WAS THAT THE COST

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:31.601 region:rollup2
OF A HIGH QUALITY EASY SYSTEM.

00:59:30.167 --> 00:59:33.036 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:34.438 region:rollup2
FORTY BILLION DOLLARS.

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:35.639 region:rollup2
NOW FOR SOME THAT MAY SEEM LIKE

00:59:34.438 --> 00:59:37.541 region:rollup2
A LARGE NUMBER OTHERS IT MAY BE

00:59:35.639 --> 00:59:40.010 region:rollup2
HARD TO PLACE IN CONTEXT I THINK

00:59:37.541 --> 00:59:40.744 region:rollup2
ONE WAY TO. CONTEXTUALIZE IT IS

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.913 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT.

00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:44.481 region:rollup2
OVER THE FOUR PHASES IN WHICH

00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:46.249 region:rollup2
WE ENVISION THE SYSTEM BEING

00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:47.751 region:rollup2
PHASED AND BY THE TIME YOU GET

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:48.885 region:rollup2
TO THE FINAL PHASE OR THE THE

00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:51.288 region:rollup2
END GOAL.

00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:52.389 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM WOULD BE SPENDING

00:59:51.288 --> 00:59:54.891 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT OF POINT

00:59:52.389 --> 00:59:56.560 region:rollup2
SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF US GDP ON

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:58.328 region:rollup2
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. THIS

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.496 region:rollup2
IS JUST ABOUT THE AVERAGE FOR

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:01.598 region:rollup2
OTHER HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES IN

00:59:59.496 --> 01:00:02.933 region:rollup2
THE OECD. SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:04.234 region:rollup2
REASONABLE ESTIMATE GIVEN WHAT

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.769 region:rollup2
WE SEE OTHER HIGH COUNTRIES

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:07.104 region:rollup2
DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.271 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.106 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION WE CAN ALSO PLACE IN

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.540 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT OF K. TWELVE

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:12.442 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.910 region:rollup2
SERVING CHILDREN FROM THE AGE

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:15.712 region:rollup2
VAN FROM ZERO TO KINDERGARTEN

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:17.547 region:rollup2
ENTRY REPRESENTS.

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:19.216 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE ABOUT.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:20.717 region:rollup2
.

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.651 region:rollup2
ONE THIRD AS MANY CHILDREN AS

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:22.752 region:rollup2
ARE SERVED IN THE K. TWELVE

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:23.620 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:25.122 region:rollup2
YET WE WITH.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.490 region:rollup2
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.023 region:rollup2
SPENDING ABOUT TWENTY TWO

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:28.758 region:rollup2
PERCENT AS MUCH AS THE K.

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:30.560 region:rollup2
TWELVE.

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:32.095 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AS A WHOLE SUSPENDED

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.630 region:rollup2
FEWER RESOURCES PER CHILD THAN

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:36.800 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SEE IN THE CASE.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:38.368 region:rollup2
TO TWELVE YEARS.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.103 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONSIDERATION ONCE WE

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:41.938 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT ESTIMATE OF A HUNDRED

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:43.573 region:rollup2
FORTY BILLION DOLLARS WAS TO

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:46.076 region:rollup2
THEN INVESTIGATE HOW ONE COULD

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:48.211 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT. OF THE SOURCES OF

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:48.678 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO PAY FOR THAT HIGH

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:49.746 region:rollup2
QUALITY EARLY CARE AND

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.715 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:52.883 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE ONE SOURCE IS THE

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:54.584 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SECTOR WHETHER THAT BE

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:56.353 region:rollup2
FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL FUNDING

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:58.021 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO ONE TO CONSIDER THE

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.589 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY THE FAMILIES WOULD

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.091 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE MUCH AS THEY DO NOW.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:02.492 region:rollup2
TO EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:03.693 region:rollup2
ALMOND THE RIVER IDEA FOR

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.427 region:rollup2
APPROACHES FOR FIGURING OUT

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:05.662 region:rollup2
WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE OR

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:06.963 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE ABOUT FOR FAMILIES TO

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:08.665 region:rollup2
PAY.

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:10.033 region:rollup2
OF COURSE ONE APPROACHES THERE

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:11.535 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NO FEES FOR FAMILIES.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:13.336 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IS OUR CURRENT K.

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:15.138 region:rollup2
TWELVE EDUCATION PUBLICLY FUNDED

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.606 region:rollup2
K. TWELVE EDUCATION.

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.207 region:rollup2
ONE COULD HAVE THE SAME KIND OF

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.341 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.776 region:rollup2
TO FIVE.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.544 region:rollup2
BUT ASSUMING THAT FAMILIES WERE

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:22.112 region:rollup2
TO CONTRIBUTE.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:24.314 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBER OF WAYS TO THINK

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:26.683 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FEES AND WE DID THAT

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:28.184 region:rollup2
BY CONSIDERING FAMILIES PAYMENTS

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.718 region:rollup2
AT THE LOWEST INCOME LEVEL WOULD

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.887 region:rollup2
BE NOTHING.

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:32.189 region:rollup2
AS A WAY NOT TO HAVE ANY

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.756 region:rollup2
BARRIERS TO THEM BEING ABLE TO

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.491 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN HIGH QUALITY

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:35.759 region:rollup2
EASY.

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:37.327 region:rollup2
AND THAT FAMILY PAYMENTS AS A

01:01:35.759 --> 01:01:38.762 region:rollup2
SHARE OF THEIR INCOME WOULD RISE

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:40.063 region:rollup2
AS INCOME INCREASED YOU COULD

01:01:38.762 --> 01:01:42.198 region:rollup2
THINK OF THIS AS A PROGRESSIVE

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:43.033 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. FOR OIL ALLOWING

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.801 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE BUT DOING

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:46.102 region:rollup2
SO AS A SHARE OF THEIR INCOME

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:48.071 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT SHARE WOULD START OUT

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.272 region:rollup2
LOW. AND GRADUALLY RISE AS

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:50.840 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM I

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:52.509 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT WHERE WE SING THE

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.477 region:rollup2
HIGHEST FAMILY PAYMENTS AT THE

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:56.846 region:rollup2
LOW END AND DECLINING AS FAMILY

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:57.013 region:rollup2
INCOME RISES.

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:59.082 region:rollup2
SO.

01:01:57.013 --> 01:02:01.017 region:rollup2
OUR REPORT THEN SHOWS.

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:02.385 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SHARE

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.887 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR FAMILIES.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.455 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THE

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:06.289 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SECTOR WHAT I WANT TO

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:08.491 region:rollup2
CONCLUDE WITH OUR?

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:09.092 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.859 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK ARE PARTICULARLY

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.094 region:rollup2
RELEVANT.

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:12.162 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR WORK BOTH AROUND

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:13.430 region:rollup2
FINANCING AND AROUND THE

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:15.432 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.133 region:rollup2
I AM THE REPORT DOES HAVE A TEN

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:19.135 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS IN TOTAL.

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:20.637 region:rollup2
I WANT TO SPEAK TO A FEW OF

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.905 region:rollup2
THEM THEY ARE GROUPS.

01:02:20.637 --> 01:02:23.540 region:rollup2
BY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.874 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO AN EFFECTIVE

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.176 region:rollup2
FINANCING STRUCTURE.

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:27.677 region:rollup2
SHARING THE COSTS OF THE

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:29.179 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE EXPECTED

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:30.714 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY FROM FAMILIES FOR

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:31.948 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR A TRANSITION FROM

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:33.083 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO ONE THAT

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:34.517 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:36.386 region:rollup2
A MORE EQUITABLE.

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:37.687 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE FINANCING SYSTEM

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.688 region:rollup2
WITH A HIGHLY QUALIFIED

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:40.457 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:42.192 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMING THE WORK FORCE

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.860 region:rollup2
ITSELF AND THEN RECOMMENDATIONS

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:45.295 region:rollup2
AROUND ASSESSING PROGRESS IN

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.496 region:rollup2
QUALITY.

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:46.896 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN I WANT TO JUST FOCUS ON

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.865 region:rollup2
A FEW OF THESE.

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.1000 region:rollup2
GIVEN TIME BUT WOULD BE HAPPY

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:51.501 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT OTHERS I'M IN THE

01:02:49.1000 --> 01:02:52.569 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.604 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:55.038 region:rollup2
HAVE AN EFFECTIVE FINANCING

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.973 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THE FIRST

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:58.441 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION. UMBER FIRST OF

01:02:56.973 --> 01:03:00.276 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT WE EXPECT THERE

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:01.177 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A ROLE FOR THE FEDERAL

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.479 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT'S AND STATE

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:04.180 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS TO ESTABLISH

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.849 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT STANDARDS FOR QUALITY

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.383 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE HAVE A MORE UNIFIED

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:07.584 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND THE WAY THAT WE

01:03:06.383 --> 01:03:09.285 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:12.122 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR EARLY CARE AND

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:14.324 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THAT FINDING WOULD BE

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:16.092 region:rollup2
TIED TO QUALITY. REGARDLESS OF

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:18.461 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT IS

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:20.664 region:rollup2
USED AND THAT STATE AND FEDERAL.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.998 region:rollup2
FINANCING MECHANISMS.

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:23.800 region:rollup2
SHOULD ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:25.335 region:rollup2
ARE RECEIVING PAYMENTS THAT ARE

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.037 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE TOTAL

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:28.838 region:rollup2
COSTS OF THESE ARE THREE ISSUES

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:30.273 region:rollup2
THAT I ADDRESSED EARLIER. IN OUR

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:35.478 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM THAT NEED TO BE.

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:37.213 region:rollup2
RECTIFIED.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.681 region:rollup2
THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION SPEAKS

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:39.382 region:rollup2
TO.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.618 region:rollup2
FINANCING WITH RESPECT TO

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:43.586 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY FOR FAMILIES.

01:03:41.618 --> 01:03:44.854 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE ONE OF OUR

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:46.856 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION HERE WAS THAT

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:48.625 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:50.760 region:rollup2
TO RECEIVE ACCESS TO SUBSIDIES

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:52.696 region:rollup2
FOR EASY. BASED UPON THEIR

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.665 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT STATUS IN THE CURRENT

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:57.100 region:rollup2
SYSTEM RECEIPT OF SOME FUNDING

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:58.468 region:rollup2
IS TIED TO EMPLOYMENT SUCH AS

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.004 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES WHEREAS

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:02.472 region:rollup2
OTHERS ARE NOT HEAD START STATE

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:04.708 region:rollup2
FUNDED PRE K. PROGRAMS DO NOT

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:06.009 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY. A LOOK AT A FAMILY'S

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.177 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT STATUS IN DETERMINING

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.445 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:10.347 region:rollup2
SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:12.115 region:rollup2
THAT UP EMPLOYMENT STATUS NOT BE

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:15.518 region:rollup2
A CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY. OF

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:16.986 region:rollup2
RECEIVING A PUBLIC SUBSIDIES.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:20.090 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAD A THIRD

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:22.192 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION LOOKED TO STATES.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.959 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR AS A MECHANISM

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.495 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:27.664 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES FROM A

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:28.898 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHITES PERSPECTIVE AND

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:30.767 region:rollup2
THAT STATES WOULD BE MUCH

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:32.969 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN A PROCESS MUCH LIKE

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:34.504 region:rollup2
YOU ARE HERE. OF DEVELOPING.

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.305 region:rollup2
THE MECHANISMS THE

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:37.207 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR CURRENT

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:39.809 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SPEAK TO BE ABLE TO MOVE

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.976 region:rollup2
TOWARD THE TYPE OF SYSTEM THAT

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:41.978 region:rollup2
WE.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:43.546 region:rollup2
ENVISION.

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.581 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO COSTS ADAM AND

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:46.783 region:rollup2
SHARING THE COSTS THE

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:47.851 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION ON THE PART OF

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:50.220 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:50.820 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMENDED THAT FINDING

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.689 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE AT THE FEDERAL

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.457 region:rollup2
STATE OR LOCAL LEVEL WOULD BE TO

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:55.692 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:58.561 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY SYSTEM THAT WE

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:59.562 region:rollup2
ENVISION. AND THAT IF WE EXPECT

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:01.297 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE THAT IT

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.232 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:03.933 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AT THE LOWEST INCOME

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.335 region:rollup2
LEVEL. WOULD PAY NOTHING TOWARD

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:06.436 region:rollup2
THE COST OF CARE AND THE SHARE

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:08.738 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD CONTRIBUTE WITH

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:11.608 region:rollup2
RISE WITH INCOME MUCH IS THE

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:13.143 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WE MODEL THOSE AT.

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:15.278 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE.

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:17.380 region:rollup2
WE DO I ENVISION A PLANNING

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:18.782 region:rollup2
PROCESS IN OUR ESTIMATES OF WE

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.483 region:rollup2
DO NOT ASSUME YOU COULD ACHIEVE

01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:21.851 region:rollup2
THE TYPE OF SYSTEM WE ENVISIONED

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:23.620 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT. ALMOND SO THERE'S A

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:24.988 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.055 region:rollup2
PROPHECIES.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:27.857 region:rollup2
TO WORK TOWARD THAT

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:29.859 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION.

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:31.394 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK FORCE.

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:32.862 region:rollup2
WE RECOGNIZED THAT.

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:35.031 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NEED BOTH TO THINK

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:35.532 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE INCUMBENT WORKFORCE AS

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.699 region:rollup2
WELL AS FUTURE WORKFORCE

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:37.567 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:39.402 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WANT TO.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:40.570 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED FOR THE

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:42.472 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.207 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE.

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:46.075 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO.

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:47.510 region:rollup2
INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:48.878 region:rollup2
COMPETENCIES IN THE FIELD.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.879 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:51.815 region:rollup2
PROSECUTIONS THROUGH HIGHER

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:53.049 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:54.751 region:rollup2
AND OTHER SUBFORUMS OF

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:55.718 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING.

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:57.253 region:rollup2
AND IN PARTICULAR THAT THE

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:58.988 region:rollup2
INCUMBENT WORKS FOR SHOULD NOT

01:05:57.253 --> 01:06:00.857 region:rollup2
BE BURDENED WITH THE COSTS OF

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:01.791 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THAT IMPROVEMENT IN

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:04.627 region:rollup2
THEIR SKILLS QUALIFICATIONS AND

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:06.563 region:rollup2
CALLED.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:08.097 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:09.599 region:rollup2
EXISTING EDGE PART OF THAT

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:11.401 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE TRANSFORMATION THAT

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:13.470 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. WOULD BE

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:15.038 region:rollup2
AB TARGETED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.573 region:rollup2
INCUMBENT WORKFORCE TO DEVELOP

01:06:15.038 --> 01:06:17.207 region:rollup2
THEIR QUALIFICATIONS.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:18.942 region:rollup2
AND.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:20.176 region:rollup2
THAT OTHER SUPPORTS WOULD BE

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:22.912 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FINANCIAL AND

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:24.347 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE FOR THE WORKFORCE.

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:26.015 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:27.484 region:rollup2
MOVING INTO THE FIELD IN ORDER

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:29.452 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.987 region:rollup2
UNDULY BURDENED WITH THE COST OF

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:32.856 region:rollup2
ACQUIRING THE EDUCATION AND

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:34.557 region:rollup2
SKILLS THEY NEED. AS THEY MOVE

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:36.192 region:rollup2
INTO THE FIELD PARTICULARLY WHEN

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:37.594 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES OF COMPENSATION ARE

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:39.028 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THE SHOULD BECOME LESS

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:40.830 region:rollup2
OF A NEED BECAUSE THE

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:42.799 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION WILL BE SUFFICIENT.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.234 region:rollup2
AND RECOGNITION OF THE DEGREES

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:46.169 region:rollup2
AND COMPETENCIES OF THE

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:48.104 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:49.472 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAD RECOMMENDATIONS

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:51.508 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO THE INSTITUTION'S

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:53.009 region:rollup2
POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS TO

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.310 region:rollup2
PROVIDE EDUCATION AND TRAINING.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:56.145 region:rollup2
AND THE NEED TO BOOST THEIR

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:57.914 region:rollup2
QUALITY AS WELL AS THE FINANCING

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:58.848 region:rollup2
OF THOSE SYSTEM. SO THINK OF

01:06:57.914 --> 01:07:00.884 region:rollup2
THESE AS THE ISSUES AROUND

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.185 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM AND THE PARTICULAR

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:04.087 region:rollup2
SETTINGS WHERE.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:05.755 region:rollup2
EASY PRACTITIONERS AND.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:07.123 region:rollup2
THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.424 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ACQUIRED THEIR SKILLS AND

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:10.093 region:rollup2
LEARNING.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:11.728 region:rollup2
AND LIKEWISE THAT STATE.

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:13.029 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:15.164 region:rollup2
NEED INSIDE OF US.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:18.334 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:19.369 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE OF HIGH QUALITY.

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:20.703 region:rollup2
I HAVE FINALLY WE HAVE

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:23.473 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE LARGER

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:25.108 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:27.143 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH AND

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:28.444 region:rollup2
EVALUATION TO ASSESS WHETHER OR

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.847 region:rollup2
NOT A TRANSFORM SYSTEM IS

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:31.481 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. AS WELL AS

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:33.283 region:rollup2
OTHER DATA COLLECTION

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:35.251 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD BE

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:37.020 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO MONITOR AND ENSURE THE

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:39.088 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE SYSTEM

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.990 region:rollup2
THAT WE ENVISION.

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.492 region:rollup2
SO IN SOME I THINK HE MESSAGES

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.660 region:rollup2
THAT COME OUT OF THE NATIONAL

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:45.562 region:rollup2
ACADEMIES REPORT.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.996 region:rollup2
INCLUDE ARE WELL FOUNDED

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:49.132 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING NOW THAT HIGH

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:50.700 region:rollup2
QUALITY YOU SEE IS CRITICAL FOR

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:52.435 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.070 region:rollup2
AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:55.805 region:rollup2
GENERATE I'M SIGNIFICANT

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.874 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT OUR

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:59.575 region:rollup2
CURRENT FINANCING STRUCTURE IS

01:07:57.874 --> 01:08:01.077 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT. THE

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:02.178 region:rollup2
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF A

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:05.548 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH I

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:06.950 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE AND TO INCENTIVIZE

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:08.217 region:rollup2
MOVEMENTS TOWARD HIGHER QUALITY.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.819 region:rollup2
THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS AN

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:11.688 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE WITH RESPECT TO

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:13.056 region:rollup2

REGARDLESS OF THEIR FAMILY

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:19.062 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND. AND TO FINALLY THAT

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:21.431 region:rollup2
THE TOTAL COSTS OF PROVIDING.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:23.266 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE TYPE OF AFFORDABLE

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:25.168 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY SYSTEM THAT WE

01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:26.669 region:rollup2
ENVISION IS ONE THAT WILL INDEED

01:08:25.168 --> 01:08:28.905 region:rollup2
NEED NEW RESOURCES FROM THE

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:31.107 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SECTOR. EVEN IF WE EXPECT

01:08:28.905 --> 01:08:32.642 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO PAY A

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.177 region:rollup2
SHARE OF THOSE COSTS.

I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:06.275 region:rollup2
FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:08.044 region:rollup2

THAT.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.295 region:rollup2
.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:28.364 region:rollup2
I IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:30.600 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THOSE.

01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:32.101 region:rollup2
CARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE UNPAID.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.270 region:rollup2
AND THOSE THAT ARE PAID SO OUR

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:36.572 region:rollup2
STUDY DID IT INCLUDE HOME BASED

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:38.207 region:rollup2
CARE. THAT'S PROVIDED COULD BE

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:39.842 region:rollup2
FAMILY FRIEND OR NEIGHBOR BUT IS

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:42.879 region:rollup2
IF IT'S COMPENSATED CARE PAID

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:42.879 region:rollup2
CARE. THAT IS COVERED BY OUR

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:46.182 region:rollup2
WAYS ONE ALL OVER ESTIMATES OF.

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:48.184 region:rollup2
THE.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:49.452 region:rollup2
NUMBER FAMILIES THAT USE CARE

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.787 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF CARE THAT THEY USE

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:52.622 region:rollup2
FOR INFANTS TODDLERS AND

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:53.656 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOLERS ALL WERE BASED ON

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:54.991 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES THAT INCLUDED HOME

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:56.659 region:rollup2
BASE SETTINGS FAMILY FRIEND AND

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:58.695 region:rollup2
NEIGHBOR CARE. IT COULD ALSO BE

01:09:56.659 --> 01:10:00.430 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE FORMALLY LICENSE

UP FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES SO

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.636 region:rollup2
THAT RANGE OF PAID CARE

PROVIDERS IN THE HOME BASE

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:10.406 region:rollup2
STUDIES IS CAPTURED. WHAT IS NOT

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:10.807 region:rollup2
CAPTURED OUR IS THE PART OF THE

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:12.542 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE THAT IS

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:14.043 region:rollup2
UNCOMPENSATED?

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.678 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THAT MAY BE

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:17.213 region:rollup2
PROVIDED IN HOME BASE SETTINGS A

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:18.748 region:rollup2
CHILD'S HOME OR ANOTHER.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:20.717 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS HOME AND THAT WAS

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:22.218 region:rollup2
JUST PARTLY A LIMITATION IN A

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:24.287 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINT ON OUR WORK IN THAT

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:25.788 region:rollup2
WE WERE CHARGED WITH LOOKING AT

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:26.823 region:rollup2
THE PAID SYSTEM.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.825 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S ENTIRELY.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:29.859 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE WITH THE TRANCE

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:31.194 region:rollup2
FORMATION THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:33.196 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THAT WE WOULD DRAW

01:10:31.194 --> 01:10:35.198 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS INTO THE

01:10:33.196 --> 01:10:36.332 region:rollup2
EASY WORKFORCE SOME OF WHOM MAY

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:38.267 region:rollup2
BE CURRENTLY PROVIDING

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:40.036 region:rollup2
UNCOMPENSATED CARE. AND THAT

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:41.671 region:rollup2
THOSE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:43.339 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE FOR.

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:44.874 region:rollup2
BECOMING A WELL QUALIFIED

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.975 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF THE PAID WORKFORCE

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:48.277 region:rollup2
WOULD BE OPEN TO THOSE

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:49.512 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO CURRENTLY TODAY.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.914 region:rollup2
MAYBE PROVIDING CARE IN THOSE

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:54.217 region:rollup2
SETTINGS ON UNCOMPENSATED BASIS.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:55.651 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:57.253 region:rollup2
WHAT MIGHT CHANGE IN TERMS OF

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:58.654 region:rollup2
FAMILIES USE OF CARE SO IF WE

01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.022 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THE BARRIERS OF THE

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:01.324 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE COST OF CARE TO

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:03.693 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WE MAY EXPECT TO SEE

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:06.229 region:rollup2
MORE FAMILIES. MOVE INTO THE

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:07.396 region:rollup2
MORE FORMAL PART OF RTC SYSTEM

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:08.731 region:rollup2
WHICH POTENTIALLY HAS THE

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:11.467 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF.

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:13.202 region:rollup2
MOVING CHILDREN INTO THESE

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:14.570 region:rollup2
MONITORED REGULATED. QUALITY

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:16.072 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:18.541 region:rollup2
MANY FAMILIES THOUGH MAY STILL

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:20.076 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO USE CARE THAT.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:21.544 region:rollup2
UNCOMPENSATED FAMILY FRIEND AND

01:11:20.076 --> 01:11:22.812 region:rollup2
NEIGHBOR CARE ALMOND THAT'S

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:24.547 region:rollup2
GONNA BE A FUNCTION OF THEIR

UNDERLYING NEEDS FOR CARE THEY

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:27.550 region:rollup2
MAY BE USING A COMBINATION.

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:28.784 region:rollup2
OF CARE FROM THE MORE FORMAL

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:30.653 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN THE INFORMAL SYSTEM

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:31.721 region:rollup2
DEPENDING UPON THEIR NEEDS.

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.955 region:rollup2
SO I I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:35.124 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT WHERE IT'S

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:37.460 region:rollup2
CAPTURED AND WHY WE WOULD EXPECT

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:38.794 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.196 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:46.068 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE INFORMAL CARE THAT

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:47.537 region:rollup2
WE SEE IS THAT.

COME.

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:56.846 region:rollup2
WHAT A FOLLOWUP BECAUSE I DIDN'T

REALLY HEAR THE PIECE ABOUT?

01:11:56.846 --> 01:12:01.784 region:rollup2
EXEMPT CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDED

INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROVIDE CARE

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:12.428 region:rollup2
AND HOME BASED SETTINGS.

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:14.630 region:rollup2
THAT WERE INCLUDING IN OUR VIEW

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:16.632 region:rollup2
OF THE SYSTEM SO ONE THING I AM

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:17.633 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO. YOU KNOW ALSO LIFT

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:20.303 region:rollup2
UP BECAUSE YOU ALSO SAID YOU

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:21.938 region:rollup2
WANNA DE DE LINK EMPLOYMENT WITH

01:12:20.303 --> 01:12:22.872 region:rollup2
NEED AND ACTUALLY I REALLY.

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:24.574 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THAT.

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:26.275 region:rollup2
.

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:27.810 region:rollup2
BUT THE JOBS THAT A LOT OF

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:30.046 region:rollup2
FAMILIES PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:31.614 region:rollup2
FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO OUR

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:34.650 region:rollup2
THESE JOBS THAT ARE IN.

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:35.184 region:rollup2
RESTAURANTS RETAIL HOSPITALITY

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.419 region:rollup2
MEDICAL FIELDS HOME HEALTH

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:38.421 region:rollup2
AIDES.

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:39.522 region:rollup2
AND.

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:41.490 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE HIGH

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:44.360 region:rollup2
QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:45.194 region:rollup2
ARE NOT OFFERED. SORT OF.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.930 region:rollup2
DURING THOSE NONTRADITIONAL

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:49.432 region:rollup2
HOURS ON NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:51.767 region:rollup2
WITH SCHEDULES THAT ARE VARYING.

01:12:49.432 --> 01:12:54.870 region:rollup2
SO HOW WHEREIN THE VISION OF

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:56.806 region:rollup2
THIS E. C. E. SYSTEM DO YOU SEE

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.908 region:rollup2
A PLACE FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

01:12:56.806 --> 01:13:00.910 region:rollup2
OF FAMILIES.

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:02.612 region:rollup2
WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.746 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY IN THEIR

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:06.382 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT REFLECT?

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:08.484 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:09.886 region:rollup2
I THINK IT A COUPLE ANSWERS THE

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:12.688 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AROUND THE.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:14.090 region:rollup2
NEED FOR NON STANDARD CARE FIVE

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:15.391 region:rollup2
HOURS.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:17.560 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:19.362 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.631 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING DOES STILL INCLUDE

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:23.266 region:rollup2
HOME BASED CARE SO FAMILIES WITH

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:24.800 region:rollup2
THOSE NEEDS FOR NONSTANDARD

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:26.802 region:rollup2
HOURS MAY CONTINUE OR MAYBE YOU

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.271 region:rollup2
DON'T CHOOSE TO USE HOME BASED

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:29.505 region:rollup2
CARE PROVIDERS. AND AGAIN THIS

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:31.040 region:rollup2
IS

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:33.409 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM THAT WE'RE ENVISIONING.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.279 region:rollup2
WHERE IF YOU'RE IN THE PAID

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:37.813 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE THAT IN

01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:38.914 region:rollup2
YOU CHOOSE AS A PROVIDER TO

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:41.183 region:rollup2
OFFER CARE DURING THOSE

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:42.485 region:rollup2
NONSTANDARD HOURS THAT WOULD BE?

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:43.786 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PART OF WHAT THE SYSTEM

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:45.021 region:rollup2
IS THAT WERE ENVISIONING.

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:46.822 region:rollup2
I THINK ANOTHER ASPECT OF.

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:48.257 region:rollup2
.

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:50.359 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.661 region:rollup2
.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:53.162 region:rollup2
SCRIBING IS WHY AND WHERE

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:54.196 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PROVIDERS WOULD BE

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:55.631 region:rollup2
COMPENSATED FOR THEIR COST OF

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:56.332 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:58.734 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:14:00.569 region:rollup2
WE WOULD EXPECT PROVIDERS TO

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:02.038 region:rollup2
OFFER MORE OPTIONS FOR CARE

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:03.839 region:rollup2
DURING NON AMHERST NONSTANDARD

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:05.308 region:rollup2
HOURS RECOGNIZING THE COST OF

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:07.243 region:rollup2
THAT PROVISION AND ONE BARRIER

01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:08.744 region:rollup2
NOW. IS THAT IT'S HARDER FOR

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:10.947 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO DIFFERENTIATE AND

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:12.548 region:rollup2
RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT TO REFLECT

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:14.884 region:rollup2
THOSE DIFFERENTIAL COST.

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:16.118 region:rollup2
SO WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:17.620 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE AND NEED ON THE

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:19.221 region:rollup2
PART OF FAMILIES WILL CONTINUE

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.489 region:rollup2
I'M A SIMILAR KINDS OF ISSUES

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:21.958 region:rollup2
AND MORE WORLD SIGHTINGS VERSUS

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:23.759 region:rollup2
URBAN SETTINGS IN TERMS OF CARE

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:25.161 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY. THAT

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:27.096 region:rollup2
MEANS WE STILL WANT A SYSTEM

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:29.532 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS FOR A DIVERSE ARRAY

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:30.833 region:rollup2
OF SETTINGS AND PROVIDER TYPES.

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:31.734 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANT TO SEE THAT IT'S

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:34.003 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY.

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:35.571 region:rollup2
AND DELIVERED BY HIGH QUALITY

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:37.206 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE AND ONE WHERE THAT.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:38.407 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE IS WELL COMPENSATED

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:41.877 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ARE COMPENSATED FOR

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:46.682 region:rollup2
THEIR CAUSE.

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:47.650 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER RACE.

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:49.618 region:rollup2
Q. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:52.054 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION.

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:53.956 region:rollup2
IN MUCH THE LITERATURE AND THAT

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:55.491 region:rollup2
THE CHIU. FRAT ON YOU YOU TALK

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:56.959 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.393 region:rollup2
THIS LEVERAGING AND IT WAS ONE

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.294 region:rollup2
OF YOUR CONCLUSIONS

01:14:57.393 --> 01:15:00.529 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:02.732 region:rollup2
SEVEN.

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:05.134 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY.

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:07.636 region:rollup2
ON LEVERAGING EXISTING FUNDING

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:09.372 region:rollup2
SOURCES AT THE STATE LEVEL.

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:11.140 region:rollup2
TO ENHANCE QUALITY FOR THE EASY

01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:12.908 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE.

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:15.044 region:rollup2
IT IS OR SOMETHING THAT.

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:17.480 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS CALIFORNIA FUNDING

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:19.548 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC THAT YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.617 region:rollup2
US ON.

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:22.518 region:rollup2
WE CAN USE FOR THE LEVERAGING

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:25.855 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAMS ARE THE LIFE

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:26.689 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WHAT I THINK THAT THE

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:28.090 region:rollup2
BASIC GOAL THAT WE WERE.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:29.125 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT IN THAT

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.160 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:32.328 region:rollup2
WANTED AS AS WE FIRST TRIED TO

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.963 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT RESOURCES WERE

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:35.331 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM AND THE

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.899 region:rollup2
FUNDING AVAILABLE.

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:38.768 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES HAVE

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:39.301 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS FEDERAL

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:41.003 region:rollup2
STATE EVEN AT AT THE LOCAL

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:43.072 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:45.641 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:49.145 region:rollup2
TO SEE A SYSTEM THAT IS MORE.

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:51.013 region:rollup2
HARMONIZED MORE UNIFIED BOTH IN

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:52.548 region:rollup2
THE SIDE OF ESTABLISHING FOR

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:54.850 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE STANDARDS FOR WHAT

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:56.886 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTES QUALITY. BUT ALSO IN

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:58.988 region:rollup2
THE WAY IN WHICH RESOURCES COULD

01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:01.056 region:rollup2
BE BETTER PULL TOGETHER. AND HE

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:02.391 region:rollup2
USED FOR SUPPORTING THIS LARGER

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.659 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BOTH FOR THE DIRECT CARE

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:05.561 region:rollup2
PROVISION AS WELL AS LARGER

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:06.796 region:rollup2
SYSTEM COSTS. AND FOR SUPPORTING

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.897 region:rollup2
THE WORKFORCE.

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:09.899 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:11.033 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY SPECIFIC MECHANISM IN

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:12.168 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT WE MIGHT HAVE

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:13.969 region:rollup2
HAD IN MIND BUT THERE ARE SOME

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:16.472 region:rollup2
STATES THAT ARE. PUTTING FORWARD

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:18.240 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO USE FOR PURPOSES OF

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:19.942 region:rollup2
INVESTING IN THEIR WORKFORCE.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.744 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE PART OF THEIR STATE

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:23.045 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:25.414 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY HAVE RESOURCES

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:27.249 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC SPECIFIC TO.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.951 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:30.086 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE TRANSFORMATION AND SO

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:31.487 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO SEE THAT THOSE

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:32.688 region:rollup2
WOULD BE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:32.888 region:rollup2
CAPTURED AS WELL THE VALUABLE TO

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:36.926 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:38.260 region:rollup2
TO THIS LARGER CYSTS.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.762 region:rollup2
WHEN EXAMINING THE THE STATE'S

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.629 region:rollup2
ROLE.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.598 region:rollup2
AS A COORDINATOR.

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:44.500 region:rollup2
SORTS

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.701 region:rollup2
FOR THE VARIOUS ENTITIES.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.136 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THAT WITHIN THE DC

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:48.437 region:rollup2
FIELD.

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:49.705 region:rollup2
WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:51.407 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD NEED TO BE CHANGED

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:54.076 region:rollup2
ARE PUT INTO PLACE?

01:16:51.407 --> 01:16:55.144 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THIS MORE EFFECTIVE.

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.912 region:rollup2
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT OUR

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:58.547 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE DID NOT GET DOWN TO

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:59.748 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY IN

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:01.383 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:04.253 region:rollup2
LIKE A PART RECOGNIZING THAT

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:05.721 region:rollup2
STATES OFTEN APPROACH THESE.

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:08.090 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:09.058 region:rollup2
SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:09.992 region:rollup2
THE.

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:11.794 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH.

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:13.662 region:rollup2
.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:15.598 region:rollup2
THAT IS IS ESTABLISHED SO

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:16.999 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES WOULD BE AROUND

01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:19.335 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE ISSUES.

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:20.402 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE'S NOW. THEY TO

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:21.737 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT STATES HAVE BEEN

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:23.305 region:rollup2
INVESTING IN STATE PRE K.

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:24.473 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THE GOVERNANCE

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.508 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THAT THEY PUT IN

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.543 region:rollup2
PLACE A VARIED QUITE

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:28.777 region:rollup2
CONSIDERABLY WHETHER. THEY HOUSE

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:30.813 region:rollup2
THAT IN THEIR DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:31.947 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.115 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ESTABLISH A NEW

01:17:31.947 --> 01:17:34.884 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:37.553 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME WAY IN WHICH YOU KNOW

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:39.188 region:rollup2
THAT EFFORT IS HOUSED WITHIN AN

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:41.390 region:rollup2
OVERALL GOVERNMENT STRUCK.

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:42.691 region:rollup2
SO WE RATHER VIEW THIS IS

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.627 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE STATES WOULD

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:47.263 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE NEEDED

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:48.864 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ENABLE

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:50.833 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF COORDINATION.

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:52.334 region:rollup2
AND HARMONIZATION OF A SYSTEM

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.435 region:rollup2
AND SOME STATES MAY BE FAR

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.904 region:rollup2
ENOUGH ALONG THAT THEY THINK

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:56.338 region:rollup2
THEY ALREADY HAVE. THAT

01:17:54.904 --> 01:17:57.840 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE GOVERNMENT

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:59.775 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IN PLACE OTHERS MAY

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.610 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE MORE TIME TO THINK

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:03.812 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.480 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN IT'S GOING TO DEPEND

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:06.048 region:rollup2
APART THE HISTORY OF WHERE THEY

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.849 region:rollup2
BEN. ALONG WITH WHERE THEY'RE

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:09.585 region:rollup2
GOING TO.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:10.119 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU REPRESENTATION

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:17.860 region:rollup2
SO.

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:20.296 region:rollup2
IT ONE OF YOUR KEY ASSUMPTIONS

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:22.831 region:rollup2
YOU HAD. MENTIONED LEAD

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:24.033 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS WITH BA DEGREES CAN

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:25.834 region:rollup2
YOU TELL ME HOW THAT RELATES TO

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:27.503 region:rollup2
FAMILY CHILDCARE.

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:28.971 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE

01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:31.574 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMING REPORT.

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:32.775 region:rollup2
THAT WAS OUR OUR FOUNDATION.

01:18:31.574 --> 01:18:34.143 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:37.012 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:39.481 region:rollup2
THEY SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:40.849 region:rollup2
THAT GOING FORWARD IN WHETHER

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:42.484 region:rollup2
YOU'RE AT HOME OR CENTER BASED

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:45.988 region:rollup2
CITING THAT THERE WOULD BE A BE

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:47.122 region:rollup2
A LEVEL. EDUCATOR AS PART OF THE

01:18:45.988 --> 01:18:48.557 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF EARLY CARE AND

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:50.125 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:52.227 region:rollup2
INFILL CHILD CARE SETTINGS.

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:53.929 region:rollup2
THAT MAY TAKE A NUMBER OF

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:55.264 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FORMS AND AND AGAIN I

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:58.067 region:rollup2
THINK PART WE NEED TO LOOK TO

01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:58.634 region:rollup2
RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIGH

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:01.236 region:rollup2
QUALITY LOOKS LIKE IN THE

01:18:58.634 --> 01:19:02.605 region:rollup2
SETTINGS. SO IT MAY BE THAT IN A

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:04.306 region:rollup2
FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME WHERE YOU

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:06.041 region:rollup2
HAVE A SMALL GROUP THAT PROVIDER

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:07.443 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE. A BACHELORS LEVEL

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:09.378 region:rollup2
DEGREE AND WHAT WE'RE ALSO

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:10.679 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IS COMPENSATION

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:12.314 region:rollup2
THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT.

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:14.383 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MODEL BABY ONE WHERE YOU

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:16.452 region:rollup2
HAVE GROUPS OF FAMILY CHILDCARE

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:18.153 region:rollup2
HOMES WORKING TOGETHER. AND

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:19.955 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THE STRUCTURES SUCH

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:21.423 region:rollup2
AS A BE A LEVEL.

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:23.859 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD BE

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:25.394 region:rollup2
SUPERVISING OR SUPPORTING THE

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:27.429 region:rollup2
FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS IN

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:28.430 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN HOMES IF THEY DO NOT

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.832 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES HOW THAT LEVEL TO

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.966 region:rollup2
CREATE.

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:32.901 region:rollup2
I'M SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS IN

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:34.169 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU COULD STRUCTURE THIS.

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:37.039 region:rollup2
AND.

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:38.807 region:rollup2
THAT BABY YOU KNOW STATE LEVEL

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:40.676 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION OR A FUNDING

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:41.677 region:rollup2
STREAM LEVEL DETERMINATION AS TO

01:19:40.676 --> 01:19:42.344 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT SPECIFICALLY LOOKS

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:44.513 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:46.849 region:rollup2
WE HAD TO MAKE A NUMBER OF

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:48.817 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RATIOS.

01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:50.619 region:rollup2
AT THINGS LIKE THAT IN COMING

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:51.787 region:rollup2
UP WITH OUR ESTIMATES AND IN

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:53.155 region:rollup2
DOING SO PARTICULAR WITH FAMILY

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:55.391 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE HOMES WE WEREN'T

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:56.892 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY ASSUMING. THAT HE

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:58.661 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THAT BE A LEVEL STAFF

01:19:56.892 --> 01:20:00.596 region:rollup2
PERSON IN EVERY FAMILY CHILDCARE

01:19:58.661 --> 01:20:02.531 region:rollup2
HOME BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES WITH

01:20:00.596 --> 01:20:03.032 region:rollup2
RATIOS BUT IT COULD BE A SHARED.

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:05.768 region:rollup2
MODEL LIKE THE ONE I WAS

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:07.469 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING MAY I ASK.

01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:09.938 region:rollup2
WHO HOME IN?

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:12.207 region:rollup2
WHAT RESEARCH WHAT GROUPS WERE

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:14.576 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION MAKING

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:16.345 region:rollup2
FOR FAMILY CHILDCARE?

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:17.479 region:rollup2
SO THAT I REFER YOU TO THE

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:19.114 region:rollup2
EARLIER NATIONAL ACADEMY OF

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:20.916 region:rollup2
SCIENCES STUDY CALLED

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:23.285 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMING THE WORKFORCE. THAT

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:25.554 region:rollup2
WAS SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THE

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:27.222 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE SKILLS COMPETENCIES

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:28.324 region:rollup2
AND RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT A

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:30.259 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE WOULD

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:32.861 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE. OTHER EXTENSIVELY

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:35.597 region:rollup2
REVIEWED THE LITERATURE AROUND.

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:37.599 region:rollup2
EDUCATION LEVELS OTHER SKILLS.

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:39.401 region:rollup2
AND TRAINING FOR THE WORK FORCE

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:41.003 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS THEIR CONCLUDING

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:42.371 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION.

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:43.806 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE COMMITTEE WAS THEN

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:45.307 region:rollup2
GIVEN AS A.

01:20:43.806 --> 01:20:46.875 region:rollup2
A FOUNDATION THAT WASN'T UP TO

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:48.844 region:rollup2
US TO.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:51.380 region:rollup2
RE DEBATE THAT CONSIDERATION.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:52.948 region:rollup2
OR OPEN BACK UP THE ISSUES THAT

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:54.516 region:rollup2
WENT INTO THAT RECOMMENDATION I

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:55.684 region:rollup2
I WOULD URGE YOU TO LOOK AT HOW

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.985 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT REPORT MORE

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.053 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:59.655 region:rollup2
QUITE CONSIDERED.

01:20:58.053 --> 01:21:01.356 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE EVIDENCE THAT'S

01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:02.224 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE NOW.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.726 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR FURTHER

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:05.794 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING AROUND THE ROLE OF

01:21:03.726 --> 01:21:06.929 region:rollup2
DEGREES VERSUS OTHER WAYS IN

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:08.831 region:rollup2
WHICH WE.

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:10.332 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE IN TERMS

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:11.467 region:rollup2
OF THEIR SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:12.134 region:rollup2
THROUGH PROFESSIONAL OTHER

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:14.436 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:21:12.134 --> 01:21:15.871 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS. AND THERE MAY BE

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:17.439 region:rollup2
INDEED BE A PERIOD OF TRANCE

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:19.274 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONING THE WORK FORCE

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:20.709 region:rollup2
FROM OUR CURRENT WORKFORCE TODAY

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:22.111 region:rollup2
MANY OF WHOM DO NOT HAVE THOSE

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:24.313 region:rollup2
DEGREES PROTECTING FAMILY

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:26.281 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE SETTINGS. TO ONES

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:28.083 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE PROVIDED WITH.

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:29.651 region:rollup2
PORTS DURING A TRANSITION.

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:31.019 region:rollup2
TO A WORKFORCE WITH THE

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:33.021 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS THAT THOSE COMING

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:33.522 region:rollup2
INTO THE WORKFORCE WOULD HAVE

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.324 region:rollup2
THOSE HIGHER SKILLS AND

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:36.658 region:rollup2
COMPETENCIES AGAIN WITH OUR

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:38.494 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THE

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:40.295 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR ATTAINING THOSE

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:41.864 region:rollup2
DEGREES. AND THE COMPENSATION

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:44.233 region:rollup2
THAT GOES WITH IT.

01:21:41.864 --> 01:21:46.068 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT I THINK IS A WAY OF

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:47.536 region:rollup2
VIEWING THAT. COMBINATION OF

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:49.705 region:rollup2
DEGREES

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:50.806 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR DEGREES THE WORK

01:21:49.705 --> 01:21:52.641 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DO IN THE FIELD AND THE

01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:54.443 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION THAT'S RECEIVED TO

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:55.744 region:rollup2
ALIGN THEM IN SUCH A WAY. THAT

01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:57.279 region:rollup2
WE CAN HAVE A HIGH QUALITY

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:58.147 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE IN BOTH HOME AND

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:00.816 region:rollup2
CENTER BASED SETTINGS.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:02.184 region:rollup2
HOME.

01:22:00.816 --> 01:22:03.952 region:rollup2
I GUESS YOU CAN TELL BY MY FACE

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:05.754 region:rollup2
I'M NOT REALLY PLEASED WITH. THE

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:07.222 region:rollup2

FOR STUDENT LOAN IF WORK.

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:58.767 region:rollup2
I HAVE ADDITIONAL BURDENS.

01:23:55.397 --> 01:24:00.302 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT REALLY AT. THE DEGREE

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:01.169 region:rollup2
DOESN'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A

01:24:00.302 --> 01:24:01.837 region:rollup2
MAKE SOMEBODY PROVIDE THAT

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:04.840 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:24:01.837 --> 01:24:05.107 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OR BAR.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.675 region:rollup2

01:24:05.107 --> 01:24:08.777 region:rollup2
.

01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:10.312 region:rollup2
THERE IS A BIG DISCONNECT AND I

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:11.413 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE IN THE GAME YOU ARE

01:24:10.312 --> 01:24:12.781 region:rollup2
ONLY THE MESSENGER BUT THE

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:14.449 region:rollup2
COMMENT WOULD BE HIS.

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:16.018 region:rollup2
BOB POLICING ADDITIONAL BURDENS

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:16.685 region:rollup2
WOULD LESSEN THE POOL OF

01:24:16.018 --> 01:24:19.154 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED.

01:24:16.685 --> 01:24:21.556 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED AND PASSIONATE.

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:23.692 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND SO HOW DO WE

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:25.594 region:rollup2
RECONCILE THAT THE INFORMATION

01:24:23.692 --> 01:24:28.797 region:rollup2
IS GREAT AND WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:24:25.594 --> 01:24:31.300 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S GREAT. AND THAT IS.

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:32.501 region:rollup2
ALSO IN AN IDEAL WORLD AND WE'RE

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:34.903 region:rollup2
HERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN IDEAL

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:37.139 region:rollup2
WORLD SO IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:38.340 region:rollup2
HOW TO MAY BE RECONCILED THAT

01:24:37.139 --> 01:24:39.341 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO THE REALITIES OF

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.143 region:rollup2
WHAT'S REALLY HAVE.

01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:42.277 region:rollup2
NOW WOULD BE GREAT

01:24:41.143 --> 01:24:44.813 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:46.181 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE MESSENGER BUT I I

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:48.350 region:rollup2
DO AGREE WITH. THE COMMENTS

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:49.918 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:51.720 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN THE PLACE

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.955 region:rollup2
THESE ADDITIONAL BURDENS. AND

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.389 region:rollup2
ARE WE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH

01:24:52.955 --> 01:24:55.157 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:56.725 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE THAT.

01:24:55.157 --> 01:24:59.962 region:rollup2
.

01:24:56.725 --> 01:25:01.663 region:rollup2
HOW DOES QUALITY?

01:24:59.962 --> 01:25:03.332 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS IS IN RESPONSE

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:04.466 region:rollup2
THE THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT.

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:05.901 region:rollup2
CAN LOOKING AT OUR

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:07.803 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION SPECIFICALLY TO

01:25:05.901 --> 01:25:09.738 region:rollup2
THE WORKFORCE.

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:11.006 region:rollup2
THAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:12.674 region:rollup2
REVOLVE AROUND NOT INCREASING

01:25:11.006 --> 01:25:14.776 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN ON THE WORKFORCE IN

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:16.445 region:rollup2
TERMS OF DEGREE OPPOSITION.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:17.579 region:rollup2
SO WHY RECOMMENDATION WAS

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:19.314 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC THAT THOSE WHO ARE

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:21.183 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY COME BUT MEMBERS OF

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:23.285 region:rollup2
THE WORKFORCE WOULD PAY NO COST.

01:25:21.183 --> 01:25:24.686 region:rollup2
TOWARD ACHIEVING ANY DEGREE

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.988 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT MAYBE AND A

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:27.923 region:rollup2
NEW SYSTEM.

01:25:25.988 --> 01:25:30.125 region:rollup2
AND SECOND OF ALL THAT FOR

01:25:27.923 --> 01:25:31.426 region:rollup2
THOSE COMING INTO THE WORKFORCE

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.828 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ALIGNMENT

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:34.029 region:rollup2
BETWEEN WHAT THEY WOULD BE

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:35.964 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE AND

01:25:34.029 --> 01:25:38.266 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EXPECTED SALARIES.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:40.535 region:rollup2
SO PARTICULARLY AND THAT THE

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:42.137 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM WITH COMPENSATION

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:43.605 region:rollup2
THAT'S LOW IN AN ADEQUATE. THAT

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:45.540 region:rollup2
WOULD IMPLY GREATER DEGREE OF

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:47.175 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY JUST TO ACHIEVE THE

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:49.111 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF PAYMENTS.

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:50.245 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU SEE THAT

01:25:49.111 --> 01:25:52.147 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION THAT WE'RE

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:53.982 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING HERE OF A WORKFORCE

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:55.217 region:rollup2
THAT'S COMPENSATED.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.485 region:rollup2
ASSISTANT WITH THERE DEGREES

01:25:55.217 --> 01:25:58.687 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:59.421 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS.

01:25:58.687 --> 01:26:00.288 region:rollup2
EATING FOR EXAMPLE

01:25:59.421 --> 01:26:01.890 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTNERS IN A PUBLIC

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:04.059 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:05.761 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU HAVE EQUIVALENT

01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:06.928 region:rollup2
AGREES TRAINING COMPETENCIES

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:07.996 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WOULD BE COMPENSATE

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:09.931 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY.

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:11.967 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WOULD THAT MIGHT

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:13.468 region:rollup2
IMPLY MORE OF THE UP FRONT COSTS

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:14.569 region:rollup2
REQUIRED FUSION MIGHT BE BORNE

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:15.937 region:rollup2
BY THE INDIVIDUAL BUT WITH THE

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:17.205 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION.

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:18.607 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD BE COMPENSATED

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:20.342 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY JUST LIKE OTHER

01:26:18.607 --> 01:26:21.510 region:rollup2
MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS ATTAIN

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:22.711 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION WITH THE

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:25.280 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS OF THE FIELDS THEY

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:26.381 region:rollup2
MOVE INTO. WILL ALLOW THEM TO

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.382 region:rollup2
PAY BACK THEIR STUDENT LOANS AND

01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:28.583 region:rollup2
SO ON. SO I THINK.

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:29.951 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S AGAIN IT'S THE

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:31.086 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF WHAT WE'RE

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.954 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING LOOKING

01:26:31.086 --> 01:26:34.656 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AT EXPECTATIONS FOR

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:35.957 region:rollup2

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:37.726 region:rollup2

DEGREES CREDENTIALS

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:40.228 region:rollup2
THE COMPENSATION THAT GOES WITH

01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:42.364 region:rollup2
IT AND THAT WHATEVER SETTING

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:44.733 region:rollup2
THEIR END. THAT THEIR

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:46.601 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH ANY PUBLIC

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:48.503 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:49.671 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION THE OTHER COSTS

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:51.039 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY SO THAT HE WON'T

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:53.742 region:rollup2
HAVE THE SHORTFALLS THAT WE HAVE

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:55.377 region:rollup2
TODAY. THAT DON'T ALLOW FOR HIGH

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:55.577 region:rollup2
QUALITY PROVISION BECAUSE.

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.013 region:rollup2

THE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES

THE DATA THAT'S BEFORE US AND

01:27:18.467 --> 01:27:21.269 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AT THE FORCES. THAT ARE

01:27:19.935 --> 01:27:22.204 region:rollup2
REALLY HELPING FORMER THINKING

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:23.271 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:27:22.204 --> 01:27:24.973 region:rollup2
SOME AREAS WHERE WE'RE GONNA

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:26.374 region:rollup2
SCRATCH OUR HEADS A LITTLE BIT

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.542 region:rollup2

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:09.451 region:rollup2
OP AS WE HAVE THOSE

01:28:08.817 --> 01:28:11.686 region:rollup2

DID IT THAT LOOKED AT OTHER

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:35.477 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA.

01:28:58.934 --> 01:29:02.470 region:rollup2
WHAT PUT FOUR BILLION ALRIGHT

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:03.572 region:rollup2
THERE WE GO ONE PREFER REALLY

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:05.740 region:rollup2
TEN BILLION?

01:29:03.572 --> 01:29:06.775 region:rollup2
A FABULOUS I'M I'M I'M CURIOUS

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:08.143 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU TALKED IN THE VERY

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:09.177 region:rollup2
BEGINNING ABOUT THREE BUCKETS

01:29:08.143 --> 01:29:10.779 region:rollup2
ALMOST RIGHT THE COST OF THE

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:12.147 region:rollup2
EARLY KERN EDUCATION COSTS OF

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:13.682 region:rollup2
THE WORK FORCE PEACE NET COST OF

01:29:12.147 --> 01:29:15.851 region:rollup2
THE STATE MECHANISM. OF IS A

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:17.552 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DECIDE

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:19.254 region:rollup2
WORKOUT IMPROPER IN IN WHAT

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:21.223 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE FALLS UNDER EACH

01:29:19.254 --> 01:29:23.225 region:rollup2
CATEGORY I'M CURIOUS I'M

01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:25.026 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IT YOU MAYBE YOU DIDN'T

01:29:23.225 --> 01:29:27.429 region:rollup2
DO IT OUT THAT WAY OR IF YOU DID

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:28.430 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE VERSUS PHASE AND I'M

01:29:27.429 --> 01:29:29.564 region:rollup2
JUST CURIOUS.

01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:31.099 region:rollup2
HOW THAT WORKED OUT ON A

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:33.034 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LEVEL?

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:35.237 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU JUST OFF THE TOP

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:37.439 region:rollup2
OF MY HEAD THAT THE SYSTEM LEVEL

01:29:35.237 --> 01:29:39.107 region:rollup2
COSTS WERE ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT

01:29:37.439 --> 01:29:40.575 region:rollup2
OF THAT NUMBER THE HUNDRED FORTY

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:43.678 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER.

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:44.946 region:rollup2
SO MOST OF IT IS IN THE DIRECT

01:29:43.678 --> 01:29:48.283 region:rollup2
CARE PROVISION.

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:50.318 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OF IT IS TIED TO FOR

01:29:48.283 --> 01:29:50.886 region:rollup2
THE WORK FORCE TRANSFORMATION

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:51.786 region:rollup2
I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:52.354 region:rollup2
BUT?

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:54.089 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE A

01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:54.589 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE MUCH OF

01:29:54.089 --> 01:29:55.790 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE DIRECT CARE

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:57.225 region:rollup2
PROVISION

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:58.827 region:rollup2
OKAY IF WE CAN GET THAT NUMBER

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:59.461 region:rollup2
THAT PERCENT YEAH THAT WOULD BE

01:29:58.827 --> 01:30:02.430 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY HELPED ALL THAT.

01:29:59.461 --> 01:30:04.266 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:06.368 region:rollup2
AND I WILL NOT THOSE OF A MATH

01:30:04.266 --> 01:30:07.569 region:rollup2
THERE SO CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT TEN

01:30:06.368 --> 01:30:08.937 region:rollup2
PERCENT GO SAY IT'S ABOUT THERE

01:30:07.569 --> 01:30:10.705 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FOURTEEN FOURTEEN FOR

01:30:08.937 --> 01:30:12.674 region:rollup2
GAMBLING.

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:14.509 region:rollup2
YEAH BUT WE HAVE NO I DIDN'T A

01:30:12.674 --> 01:30:16.378 region:rollup2
CRAFTY BUT THAT'S IT. YEAH

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:18.813 region:rollup2
HOUSING CITED A WE CAN DO ONE

01:30:16.378 --> 01:30:19.147 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR BILLION SUPPORT FOR

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:20.749 region:rollup2
THE.

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:22.350 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER AYALA.

THANK YOU LIANE BECAUSE IT'S A

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:26.655 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:28.056 region:rollup2
ISSUE IT'S A BIG BIG PICTURE.

01:30:26.655 --> 01:30:28.857 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST WANT TO HAVE US THIS

01:30:28.056 --> 01:30:30.458 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONERS THINK OF

01:30:28.857 --> 01:30:31.726 region:rollup2
ASPIRATION.

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:33.161 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:34.629 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT.

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:35.363 region:rollup2
IF THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE BEEN

SOME FRIENDS.

01:30:36.698 --> 01:30:39.401 region:rollup2
I REMEMBER WHEN KIM THERE WAS

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.469 region:rollup2
NOT A MANDATE IT IT STILL IS

01:30:39.401 --> 01:30:42.704 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:45.240 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE TEACHERS DID NOT HAVE

01:30:42.704 --> 01:30:47.342 region:rollup2
A CREDENTIAL. IN ITS TAKEN AS

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:50.045 region:rollup2
ALL THESE YEARS TO GET HERE.

01:30:47.342 --> 01:30:50.979 region:rollup2
SO JUST A COUPLE BERMAN SAYS

01:30:50.045 --> 01:30:52.514 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE VERY

01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:54.249 region:rollup2
HEATED. AND I'M TALKING HEATED

01:30:52.514 --> 01:30:55.483 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:56.418 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:30:55.483 --> 01:30:57.953 region:rollup2
DISPLACING THE EXISTING

01:30:56.418 --> 01:31:00.055 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE.

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:01.489 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY NEED MORE.

01:31:00.055 --> 01:31:03.224 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NO COST

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:04.993 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE INCURRED BY THE

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:07.128 region:rollup2
EXISTING WORKFORCE.

01:31:04.993 --> 01:31:10.131 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER TIME

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:11.666 region:rollup2
PHASING IN OVER A MAY BE AT TEN

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:14.002 region:rollup2
OR TWELVE YEAR.

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:15.437 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:31:14.002 --> 01:31:17.105 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. MAKING

01:31:15.437 --> 01:31:17.972 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

01:31:17.105 --> 01:31:20.575 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S.

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:21.643 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE ARE

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:23.111 region:rollup2
DISCOUNTED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING

01:31:21.643 --> 01:31:25.280 region:rollup2
TO NEED THAT.

01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:26.915 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.217 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR AN

01:31:26.915 --> 01:31:31.019 region:rollup2
EDUCATED. AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:32.520 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD A LOT OF

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:34.289 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE. IF THEY CAN

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:36.424 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE THROUGH COMPETENCIES

01:31:34.289 --> 01:31:38.526 region:rollup2
ARE PATHWAYS THAT'S A DECISION

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:40.729 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ME.

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:42.464 region:rollup2
THIS IS A NATIONAL REPORT. THAT

01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:45.700 region:rollup2
WAS BASED ON ANOTHER REPORT THEY

01:31:42.464 --> 01:31:47.235 region:rollup2
DID TALK SPECIFICALLY THAT A LOT

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.403 region:rollup2
OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:50.739 region:rollup2
GROW.

01:31:48.403 --> 01:31:53.108 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE NATIONAL RESOURCE

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:55.210 region:rollup2
AND REFERRAL ASSOCIATION. AND A

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:56.644 region:rollup2
LOT OF OTHER GROUPS IN TERMS OF

01:31:55.210 --> 01:31:58.213 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT HAD BEEN DONE WITH

01:31:56.644 --> 01:32:00.181 region:rollup2
HOME CARE.

01:31:58.213 --> 01:32:02.751 region:rollup2
IT WAS ALSO THE PREVIOUS REPORT

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:04.452 region:rollup2
WAS NOT ONLY EDUCATION BUT IT

01:32:02.751 --> 01:32:07.055 region:rollup2
DEALT WITH SOCIAL WORK AND

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:07.522 region:rollup2
HEALTH PROVIDERS. AS IT RELATED

01:32:07.055 --> 01:32:09.257 region:rollup2
TO THE ZERO TWO EIGHT

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:10.592 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:12.761 region:rollup2
SO I WANT US TO THINK.

01:32:10.592 --> 01:32:15.163 region:rollup2
NOT WHAT IS.

01:32:12.761 --> 01:32:17.265 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT SHOULD BE.

01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:19.434 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE THINK ABOUT NOT THE

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:20.902 region:rollup2
BARRIERS TODAY. BUT HOW WE GET

01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:22.637 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:24.839 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:28.043 region:rollup2
CAREER PATHWAYS

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:30.345 region:rollup2
ARE HARMONIZATION OF FUNDING.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:31.513 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY THAT GETS IS THERE

01:32:30.345 --> 01:32:32.881 region:rollup2
AND I WANNA GO BACK JUST TO TO

01:32:31.513 --> 01:32:35.417 region:rollup2
MISS THEM.

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:38.052 region:rollup2
LAGOS A OR ACTUALLY IT WAS.

01:32:35.417 --> 01:32:40.488 region:rollup2
ELEVATIONS THEM RAISES

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:43.491 region:rollup2
QUESTION THERE ARE SOME.

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:45.960 region:rollup2
MODELS THAT ARE WORKING FOR US.

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:48.430 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE SMALL. AND.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.664 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE MIGHT BE INVESTING.

01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:51.966 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BILLION

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:53.968 region:rollup2
BUT AS YOU SAID MR MCCARTY WE

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:55.570 region:rollup2
NEED FOURTEEN MORE BILLION. AND

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:57.238 region:rollup2
I THINK MICHAEL HAD TO ATTEND

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:59.374 region:rollup2
BUT I LIKE YOUR NUMBER BETTER.

01:32:57.238 --> 01:33:01.242 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN BILLION TO GET US TO

01:32:59.374 --> 01:33:02.243 region:rollup2
WHERE WE NEED TO BE. BUT IT'S

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.745 region:rollup2
GONNA BE OVER TIME

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:05.513 region:rollup2
AND SO I I DON'T WANT US TO

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:07.715 region:rollup2
BECOME DISCOURAGED.

01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:08.817 region:rollup2
I WANT US TO BECOMING COURAGE

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:11.653 region:rollup2
AND EXCITED ABOUT THE

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:14.355 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE FOR ME

01:33:11.653 --> 01:33:17.025 region:rollup2
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:18.660 region:rollup2
I SEE THE LIGHT.

01:33:17.025 --> 01:33:19.694 region:rollup2
I REALLY DO LOVE AT THAT TIME

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:21.262 region:rollup2
THING WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE A JUST

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:23.531 region:rollup2
A REMINDER THAT'S WHAT THIS BLUE

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:24.966 region:rollup2
RIBBON COMMISSIONS ABOUT IS TO

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.400 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE NORTH STAR AND.

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:27.335 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.870 region:rollup2
BE PROVOCATIVE IT THINK YOU

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:30.839 region:rollup2
KNOW WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:31.372 region:rollup2
WHERE WE SHOULD BE BUT I BUT I

01:33:30.839 --> 01:33:32.106 region:rollup2
WILL NOTE THAT THESE THESE

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:33.541 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:35.343 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE EDUCATION LEVEL TO

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:36.811 region:rollup2
BE A WE DO NOW WE'VE TALKED

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:38.379 region:rollup2
ABOUT HEAD START BECAUSE THEY

01:33:36.811 --> 01:33:41.082 region:rollup2
ARE THEY'RE MAKING THIS CHANGE.

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:41.683 region:rollup2
IN ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:44.152 region:rollup2
YOU BROUGHT UP WHAT WHY IT'S

01:33:41.683 --> 01:33:46.855 region:rollup2
HARD. IS BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE

01:33:44.152 --> 01:33:47.455 region:rollup2
IN THE FIELDS UP ONE THEY'RE

01:33:46.855 --> 01:33:48.156 region:rollup2
DOING A GREAT JOB YOU KNOW AND

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.190 region:rollup2
IT.

01:33:48.156 --> 01:33:50.925 region:rollup2
A PUSH THEM OUT AS HAVING SOME

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:52.160 region:rollup2

PAID YOU KNOW IN AND OUT BURGER

01:33:57.832 --> 01:34:01.970 region:rollup2
COSCO WAGES WILL FINALLY PAY

THOSE POVERTY WE JUST PRAY THAT

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.706 region:rollup2
THEIR WORKFORCE AND SO.

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:07.008 region:rollup2

THE PROGRAMS.

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:14.816 region:rollup2
THEN WE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:16.084 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND THEN I THINK YOU CAN

IT COSTS.

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:21.322 region:rollup2
BECAUSE

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:22.524 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE RESEARCH DOES SHOW

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:24.025 region:rollup2
THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON QUALITY IF

01:34:22.524 --> 01:34:25.693 region:rollup2
YOU WANT.

WILL NOW MOVE ON TO.

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:39.908 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR.

01:34:38.373 --> 01:34:42.510 region:rollup2
MANY INDIAN.

01:34:39.908 --> 01:34:44.946 region:rollup2
CLOSE.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:46.681 region:rollup2
MELENDEZ MEANT OKAY IN INDIA YES

01:34:44.946 --> 01:34:47.782 region:rollup2
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR AND.

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:49.651 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR.

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:51.419 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AT THE HOSPICE A TOOT

01:34:49.651 --> 01:34:52.987 region:rollup2
AT UC BERKELEY.

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:54.889 region:rollup2
THANK YOU. AND WELCOME TO THE

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:56.858 region:rollup2
STATE ASSEMBLY TODAY.

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:57.592 region:rollup2
THANK YOU COMMISSIONERS AND

01:34:56.858 --> 01:34:59.928 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN MCCARTY.

01:34:57.592 --> 01:35:01.296 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY FOR HAVING US HERE BUT

01:34:59.928 --> 01:35:02.830 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS VERY

01:35:01.296 --> 01:35:04.332 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:06.568 region:rollup2
CRITICAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:08.203 region:rollup2
OCCURS BEFORE AGE FIVE AND YET.

01:35:06.568 --> 01:35:10.338 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES RANKS TWENTY

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:12.640 region:rollup2
SIXTH OUT OF OECD COUNTRIES IN

01:35:10.338 --> 01:35:14.275 region:rollup2
THE FRACTION OF FOUR YEAR OLDS

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.677 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ENROLLED IN PRE K..

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:17.845 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY FOURTH IN THE

01:35:15.677 --> 01:35:18.046 region:rollup2
FRACTION OF THREE YEAR OLDS.

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:19.914 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:21.549 region:rollup2
I'M NOT HERE TO PRESENT ON THE

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:23.084 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE HIGH.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:24.085 region:rollup2
I'M HERE RATHER TO DISCUSS A

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:25.520 region:rollup2
POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR YOU TO

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:25.954 region:rollup2
CONSIDER.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:28.089 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:35:25.954 --> 01:35:28.923 region:rollup2
WE THINK MIGHT BE VERY HELPFUL

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:32.126 region:rollup2
AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:34.562 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:35.730 region:rollup2
AND THAT FREE MARKETS WHAT SOME

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:37.398 region:rollup2
FED A SCOTCH PAUL AND HARVARD

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:39.167 region:rollup2
CALLS TARGETING WITHIN

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:40.602 region:rollup2
UNIVERSALISM IN WHAT WE CALL. IT

01:35:39.167 --> 01:35:42.470 region:rollup2
THE HAWES INSTITUTE TARGETED

01:35:40.602 --> 01:35:43.771 region:rollup2
UNIVERSALISM.

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:45.506 region:rollup2
SO THIS FRAMEWORK IS AN EQUITY

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:48.409 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK.

01:35:45.506 --> 01:35:50.578 region:rollup2
BUT IS NOT A POLICY AND DOES NOT

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:51.913 region:rollup2
SUBSTITUTE FOR POLICY.

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:53.615 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IT'S NOT A STRATEGY

01:35:51.913 --> 01:35:54.115 region:rollup2
RATHER IT'S AN APPROACH BY WHICH

01:35:53.615 --> 01:35:55.850 region:rollup2
EQUITY STRATEGIES MAY BE

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:58.686 region:rollup2
DERIVED.

01:35:55.850 --> 01:36:00.188 region:rollup2
AND IT ALSO EXPRESSES A

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:02.423 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO BOTH PROCESS IN

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:04.659 region:rollup2
EQUITY OUTCOMES.

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:07.195 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE

01:36:04.659 --> 01:36:08.229 region:rollup2
BINARY TRAP OF EITHER TARGETED

01:36:07.195 --> 01:36:09.964 region:rollup2
FOR UNIVERSAL POLICY SO I'M

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:11.266 region:rollup2
GONNA TRY AND.

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:12.333 region:rollup2
IF WE RUN THROUGH THOSE AND THEN

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:14.802 region:rollup2
OPEN UP FOR.

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:16.070 region:rollup2
SOME QUESTIONS.

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:17.472 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:19.307 region:rollup2
THIS TRAP OF TARGETED VERSES

01:36:17.472 --> 01:36:22.010 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL.

01:36:19.307 --> 01:36:24.045 region:rollup2
IS CREATES A FALSE BINARY THAT

01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:24.912 region:rollup2
WE. THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY

01:36:24.045 --> 01:36:26.881 region:rollup2
FIND OUR WAY THROUGH.

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:28.850 region:rollup2
.

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:30.518 region:rollup2
SO UNIVERSAL POLICIES ARE THOSE

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:32.387 region:rollup2
THAT ASPIRE TO SERVE EVERYONE

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:33.721 region:rollup2
WITHOUT REGARD TO GROUP

01:36:32.387 --> 01:36:36.024 region:rollup2
MEMBERSHIP STATUS ARE INCOME.

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:37.825 region:rollup2
AND THEY TEND TO SET A UNIFORM

01:36:36.024 --> 01:36:39.327 region:rollup2
EITHER SET OF BENEFITS OR OUR

01:36:37.825 --> 01:36:41.596 region:rollup2
GOAL OR SET A MINIMUM

01:36:39.327 --> 01:36:44.032 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS SO. FOR EXAMPLE

01:36:41.596 --> 01:36:44.198 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS.

01:36:44.032 --> 01:36:45.566 region:rollup2
OR.

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:45.733 region:rollup2
IN A.

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:47.602 region:rollup2
THE.

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:49.070 region:rollup2
.

01:36:47.602 --> 01:36:50.838 region:rollup2
THE POPULAR THING THESE DAYS IS

01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:53.007 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME WHICH

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:55.310 region:rollup2
IS A IS A POLICY APPROACH THAT

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:56.544 region:rollup2
WOULD. PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT OF

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:57.879 region:rollup2
EQUAL AMOUNT TO EVERYONE

01:36:56.544 --> 01:36:59.213 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF INCOME SO THE

01:36:57.879 --> 01:37:00.548 region:rollup2
WEALTHIEST INDIVIDUALS WOULD

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:02.283 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THE SAME BENEFIT.

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:04.452 region:rollup2
IS THE POOREST.

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:04.952 region:rollup2
AND SO THE IDEA OF UNIVERSAL IS

01:37:04.452 --> 01:37:05.820 region:rollup2
THAT IT IT REALLY MEANS

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:08.056 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:09.624 region:rollup2
.

01:37:08.056 --> 01:37:12.627 region:rollup2
SO SOMETIMES POLICIES ARE

01:37:09.624 --> 01:37:13.995 region:rollup2
DEVISED THAT HAVE A UNIVERSAL

01:37:12.627 --> 01:37:15.229 region:rollup2
SCOPE OR FRAMING BUT ARE

01:37:13.995 --> 01:37:17.365 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TRYING TO SOLVE THE

01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:19.400 region:rollup2
TARGETED PROBLEM THE FMLA IS A.

01:37:17.365 --> 01:37:20.835 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THAT ITS ORIGINAL

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.005 region:rollup2
IMPETUS WAS TO.

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:25.973 region:rollup2
PROVIDE LEAVE FOR FAMILIES WITH.

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:27.041 region:rollup2
.

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:28.776 region:rollup2
WITH PREGNANT.

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:30.078 region:rollup2
PARENTS PIG PARENTS AND NEW

01:37:28.776 --> 01:37:33.081 region:rollup2
PARENTS

01:37:30.078 --> 01:37:34.615 region:rollup2
AND. IN ITS ULTIMATE EXPRESSION

01:37:33.081 --> 01:37:36.818 region:rollup2
THE THE LAW ACTUALLY ALLOWED

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:37.952 region:rollup2
ANYONE TO TAKE A LEAVE INCLUDING

01:37:36.818 --> 01:37:39.487 region:rollup2
CARING FOR ELDERLY PARENTS OR

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:40.822 region:rollup2
SIBLINGS.

01:37:39.487 --> 01:37:42.323 region:rollup2
SO IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A

01:37:40.822 --> 01:37:45.860 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL APPROACH WITH A

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:46.861 region:rollup2
TARGETED A TARGETED PROBLEM.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.496 region:rollup2
NOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:50.264 region:rollup2
TART WITH UNIVERSAL APPROACHES

01:37:48.496 --> 01:37:51.966 region:rollup2
IS THAT UNIVERSAL APPROACHES.

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:52.900 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE A TENDENCY IN MANY

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:54.669 region:rollup2
INSTANCES TO EXACERBATE

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:56.871 region:rollup2
INEQUALITY.

01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:58.139 region:rollup2
SO IN THE INITIAL CDC STUDY OF

01:37:56.871 --> 01:37:59.173 region:rollup2
THE MASSACHUSETTS UNIVERSAL

01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:00.608 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE THE SO CALLED

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:02.777 region:rollup2
ROMNEYCARE APPROACH.

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:04.112 region:rollup2
THE CDC REALIZE THAT WHILE

01:38:02.777 --> 01:38:05.913 region:rollup2
EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE TO

01:38:04.112 --> 01:38:07.215 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:08.683 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENTIAL ACCESS TO

01:38:07.215 --> 01:38:10.218 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE ITSELF ACTUALLY

01:38:08.683 --> 01:38:11.819 region:rollup2
EXPANDED THE RACIAL GAPS

01:38:10.218 --> 01:38:13.521 region:rollup2
IN ACCESS TO CARE.

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:14.122 region:rollup2
SO I CAN ASSURE YOU A COUPLE

01:38:13.521 --> 01:38:14.322 region:rollup2
SLIDES AND HOW THAT CAN MODEL

01:38:14.122 --> 01:38:16.791 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:38:14.322 --> 01:38:18.159 region:rollup2
.

01:38:16.791 --> 01:38:18.693 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE WE DEFINE WHEN WE

01:38:18.159 --> 01:38:24.098 region:rollup2
DEFINE TARGETED WOULD BE A

01:38:18.693 --> 01:38:26.567 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT TARGET

01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:27.301 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC POPULATIONS BASED UPON

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:29.237 region:rollup2
THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ARE

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:32.573 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHICS.

01:38:29.237 --> 01:38:33.641 region:rollup2
AND SO. IN THIS CASE THERE'S A

01:38:32.573 --> 01:38:35.343 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS A

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:36.878 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND IN THE POLICY LUCIEN

01:38:35.343 --> 01:38:39.180 region:rollup2
POLICY PROPOSE OUR SOLUTION IS

01:38:36.878 --> 01:38:40.748 region:rollup2
TAILORED TO THAT PROBLEM.

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.749 region:rollup2
SO EXAMPLES MIGHT BE THE

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:43.684 region:rollup2
AMERICAN JUST WITH DISABILITIES

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:45.019 region:rollup2
ACT WHICH NOT ONLY PROHIBITS

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:47.155 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION REQUIRES EQUAL

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:49.323 region:rollup2
TREATMENT. BUT ALSO REQUIRE

01:38:47.155 --> 01:38:53.060 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS INCLUDING

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:55.363 region:rollup2
EASEMENTS ENTRANCES AND PARKING.

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:56.764 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT

01:38:55.363 --> 01:38:58.166 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.967 region:rollup2
MIGHT FALL INTO THE UNIVERSAL

01:38:58.166 --> 01:39:01.536 region:rollup2
VERSUS TARGETED A FRAMEWORK SO

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:03.070 region:rollup2
YOU COULD COMPARE. UNIVERSAL

01:39:01.536 --> 01:39:04.405 region:rollup2
BASIC INCOME WITH A NEGATIVE

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:05.540 region:rollup2
INCOME TAX WHICH WOULD BE

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:06.174 region:rollup2
CONDITION ON INCOME

01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:07.275 region:rollup2
OR.

01:39:06.174 --> 01:39:10.978 region:rollup2
SNAPPED VERSUS A SINGLE PAYER

01:39:07.275 --> 01:39:11.579 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:13.181 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS A

01:39:11.579 --> 01:39:14.749 region:rollup2
ALREADY MENTIONED WITH EQUAL

01:39:13.181 --> 01:39:17.418 region:rollup2
TREATMENT A UNIVERSAL APPROACHES

01:39:14.749 --> 01:39:18.986 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:20.354 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO THE GOAL. SO THIS IS

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:20.988 region:rollup2
LIKE A MEME THAT CIRCULATE ON

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:22.657 region:rollup2
THE INTERNET QUITE A BEEN THERE

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:23.825 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF. IMAGES LIKE THIS THAT

01:39:22.657 --> 01:39:25.326 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATE THAT PROBLEM RIGHT

01:39:23.825 --> 01:39:27.895 region:rollup2
THAT EQUAL TREATMENT DOES NOT

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:29.897 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET EVERYONE. TO THE

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:30.965 region:rollup2
EQUITY OUTCOME.

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:32.266 region:rollup2
SO HERE IS A HERE'S ANOTHER

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:33.234 region:rollup2
SLIDE THE CAN SHOW HOW UNIVERSAL

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:35.269 region:rollup2
PROGRAM CAN DO THIS.

01:39:33.234 --> 01:39:37.171 region:rollup2
SO I'M.

01:39:35.269 --> 01:39:38.973 region:rollup2
CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:40.975 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GROUPS AND THEY COULD BE

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:42.610 region:rollup2
RACIAL GROUPS GENDER GROUPS A.

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:43.911 region:rollup2
ANY GROUP ANY ANY GROUP BASED

01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:45.913 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTIC AND YOU HAVE A

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:48.382 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL PROGRAM. AND UNIVERSAL

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:50.084 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS A HE IS THE TREATS

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:51.385 region:rollup2
THAT EXTENDS BENEFITS EQUALLY

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.620 region:rollup2
INTRIGUES MEMBERS OF EACH GROUP

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:55.623 region:rollup2
OF THE SAME.

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:57.024 region:rollup2
BUT OF FOR MEMBERS IN THE SHADED

01:39:55.623 --> 01:39:57.925 region:rollup2
GROUPS A DAY LIVE IN

01:39:57.024 --> 01:40:00.528 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT SAY FOR

01:39:57.925 --> 01:40:01.863 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ARE ISOLATED FROM JOBS

01:40:00.528 --> 01:40:03.598 region:rollup2
AND SO JOB TRAINING PROGRAM

01:40:01.863 --> 01:40:05.132 region:rollup2
WOULD ACTUALLY FREE. THE PEOPLE

01:40:03.598 --> 01:40:06.501 region:rollup2
WHO NOW HAVE THE SKILLS TO

01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:07.969 region:rollup2
SECURE THE JOBS WHEREAS THE

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:08.903 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TRANSIT TO

01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:10.738 region:rollup2
THE JOBS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS

01:40:08.903 --> 01:40:12.373 region:rollup2
TO THE JOBS.

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:16.744 region:rollup2
A WERE WHY THEY MAY HAVE THE.

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:17.345 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN CAPITAL THEY DON'T

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.479 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:19.113 region:rollup2
SECURE THOSE JOBS AND THIS IS

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:20.147 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM THE CDC IDENTIFIED

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:21.182 region:rollup2
IN MASSACHUSETTS WHICH WAS THAT.

01:40:20.147 --> 01:40:22.550 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVING INSURANCE

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:27.855 region:rollup2
DOESN'T GIVE YOU ACCESS TO

01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:28.723 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.

01:40:27.855 --> 01:40:29.891 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IS TARGETING

01:40:28.723 --> 01:40:32.493 region:rollup2
UNIVERSALISM AND HOW CAN

01:40:29.891 --> 01:40:33.361 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:34.629 region:rollup2
THIS IS A LOT OF TAX BILL FOR ME

01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:35.730 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT BASICALLY IT'S AN

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:37.164 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:39.433 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORTS THE NEEDS OF THE

01:40:37.164 --> 01:40:40.067 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR WHILE REMINDING US

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:41.636 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ALL PART OF THE SAME

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:48.075 region:rollup2
SOCIAL FABRIC

01:40:41.636 --> 01:40:48.776 region:rollup2
SO REJECTS A KIND OF UNIVERSAL

01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:49.410 region:rollup2
BLANKET THAT'S INDIFFERENT TO IT

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.611 region:rollup2
TO HELP PARTICULAR GROUPS ARE

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:51.746 region:rollup2
SITUATED IN SOCIETY.

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:52.380 region:rollup2
IS AND IT ALSO REJECTS A KIND

01:40:51.746 --> 01:40:52.980 region:rollup2
OF

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.714 region:rollup2
FORMA A FORMAL EQUALITY THAT

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:55.516 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:57.552 region:rollup2
CREATES A DISPARATE IMPACT.

01:40:55.516 --> 01:40:58.653 region:rollup2
SO IN ITS MOST SIMPLIFIED FORM

01:40:57.552 --> 01:41:00.221 region:rollup2
WHAT IT MEANS TO SETTING

01:40:58.653 --> 01:41:00.755 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL GOALS AND PURSUING

01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:02.723 region:rollup2
THOSE GOALS WITH TARGETED

01:41:00.755 --> 01:41:03.357 region:rollup2
PROCESS HE'S

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.358 region:rollup2
GONNA WALK YOU THROUGH A STEP BY

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:05.760 region:rollup2
STEP.

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:09.330 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK TO SHOW HOW YOU DO

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.765 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:12.300 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST STEP IS YOU HAVE TO

01:41:10.765 --> 01:41:14.602 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THE UNIVERSAL GOAL

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:15.570 region:rollup2
BASED UPON. A BROADLY SHARED

01:41:14.602 --> 01:41:17.338 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM.

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:19.106 region:rollup2
.

01:41:17.338 --> 01:41:20.007 region:rollup2
A SECOND THEN IS YOU ASSESSED

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:21.909 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL POPULATION

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:23.611 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE TO THE UNIVERSAL

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:25.680 region:rollup2
GOAL SO CAN BE ANYTHING BE. A

01:41:23.611 --> 01:41:26.681 region:rollup2
MATH PROFICIENCY COULD BE

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:28.349 region:rollup2
INCLUDES A YEAH COULD ENGLISH

01:41:26.681 --> 01:41:30.384 region:rollup2
PROFICIENCY IT COULD BE ACCESS

01:41:28.349 --> 01:41:32.219 region:rollup2
TO HEALTH CARE COULD BE ACCESS

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:33.621 region:rollup2
TO EARLY QUITE A HIGH QUALITY

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:35.289 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND.

01:41:33.621 --> 01:41:35.957 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:37.258 region:rollup2
I'M SO THE FIRST THING YO DO IS

01:41:35.957 --> 01:41:39.126 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO DO A KIND OF GENERAL

01:41:37.258 --> 01:41:41.062 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT.

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:42.763 region:rollup2
THE THIRD IS THEN YOU BEGIN TO

01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:44.231 region:rollup2
SEE THE LOOK AT SUB GROUPS AND

01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:46.233 region:rollup2
YOU IDENTIFY GROUPS AND PLACES

01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:47.401 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT JUST. UP COMMUNITIES

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:49.070 region:rollup2
OUR POPULATIONS BUT YOU ALSO

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:50.671 region:rollup2
NEED TO LOOK AT GEOGRAPHIES.

01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:53.641 region:rollup2
SEE HOW THOSE PLACES AND GROUPS

01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:55.543 region:rollup2
ARE PERFORMING RELATIVE TO BOTH

01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:56.544 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL POPULATION BUT

01:41:55.543 --> 01:41:58.212 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY THE

01:41:56.544 --> 01:42:00.247 region:rollup2
GOAL RIGHT BECAUSE THE GOAL

01:41:58.212 --> 01:42:02.016 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE TO GET. YOU KNOW

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:03.718 region:rollup2
ONE GROUP TO WHERE THE BEST

01:42:02.016 --> 01:42:05.920 region:rollup2
PERFORMING GROUP IS BUT RATHER

01:42:03.718 --> 01:42:06.921 region:rollup2
EVERY GROUP TO THE GOAL ITSELF.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:09.523 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT'S ACTUALLY A KEY

01:42:06.921 --> 01:42:10.624 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION.

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:11.525 region:rollup2
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE MOST

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:13.628 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP IN A TARGET

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:15.663 region:rollup2
PERSONAL SOME FRAMEWORK.

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:16.731 region:rollup2
STOOD THEN ASSESS AND UNDERSTAND

01:42:15.663 --> 01:42:18.966 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURES THAT EITHER

01:42:16.731 --> 01:42:19.967 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OR IMPEDE. EACH COOPER

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.002 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE FROM ACHIEVING THE

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.203 region:rollup2
GOAL SEAT ACTUALLY HAVE TO

01:42:21.002 --> 01:42:23.437 region:rollup2
CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS TO

01:42:22.203 --> 01:42:25.039 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IT THAT'S

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:27.708 region:rollup2
HOLDING FOLKS BACK.

01:42:25.039 --> 01:42:28.776 region:rollup2
NOW IT MAY BE BARRIERS IT MAY BE

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:30.311 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES MAY BE A LACK OF

01:42:28.776 --> 01:42:32.413 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION IT MAY BE A LACK

01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:33.914 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT. BUT IT MIGHT ALSO BE

01:42:32.413 --> 01:42:35.883 region:rollup2
THAN SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:37.718 region:rollup2
THEY ARE OTHER SORT OF PROACTIVE

01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:39.220 region:rollup2
OF AFFIRMATIVE STRUCTURES THAT

01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:40.721 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOLKS TO ADVANCE TO THE

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:43.090 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL GOAL SO IT'S NOT

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:44.158 region:rollup2
ALWAYS A BARRIER SO MUCH AS IT

01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:45.993 region:rollup2
MAY THE ABSENCE OF RESOURCES OR.

01:42:44.158 --> 01:42:47.294 region:rollup2
OR CAPACITIES.

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:49.096 region:rollup2
AND ONCE YOU DEVELOP AN

01:42:47.294 --> 01:42:50.531 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS THEN YOU

01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:51.732 region:rollup2
NEED TO BEGIN TO DEVELOP AND

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:53.234 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT TARGETED STRATEGIES

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:55.069 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY GROUP.

01:42:53.234 --> 01:42:56.303 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A UNIVERSAL BLANKET

01:42:55.069 --> 01:42:58.072 region:rollup2
STRATEGY TO TREAT EVERYONE THE

01:42:56.303 --> 01:42:59.707 region:rollup2
SAME I ACTUALLY FAILED TO GET

01:42:58.072 --> 01:43:00.941 region:rollup2
YOU TO THE UNIVERSAL GOAL.

01:42:59.707 --> 01:43:02.076 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:02.743 region:rollup2
CRITICAL PART AS YOU MIGHT HAVE

01:43:02.076 --> 01:43:04.512 region:rollup2
A MARRIED A PLETHORA OF

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:05.413 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES.

01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:07.014 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE STRATEGIES ARE

01:43:05.413 --> 01:43:08.349 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO GET EVERYONE TO THE

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:08.849 region:rollup2
GOAL AND THAT IS THE HEART OF

01:43:08.349 --> 01:43:10.184 region:rollup2
THE TARGET PERSONAL SOME

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:12.219 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK.

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:13.688 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK IS A FOCUS ON

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:14.955 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL GOALS BUT TO

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:15.856 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION THAT YOU NEED

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:20.327 region:rollup2
TARGETED POLICIES TO

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:21.896 region:rollup2
TO REACH THOSE GOALS.

01:43:20.327 --> 01:43:24.098 region:rollup2
NOT JUST A COUPLE OF CAVIAR ARE

01:43:21.896 --> 01:43:25.499 region:rollup2
NOTES ON THE FRAMEWORK.

01:43:24.098 --> 01:43:26.634 region:rollup2
TARGETING WITHIN A TARGET VERSE

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:29.003 region:rollup2
WASN'T FRAMEWORK DOES NOT ALWAYS

01:43:26.634 --> 01:43:30.838 region:rollup2
MEAN TARGETING PEOPLE OR EVEN

01:43:29.003 --> 01:43:32.239 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS OFTEN DOES BUT NOT

01:43:30.838 --> 01:43:34.275 region:rollup2
ALWAYS OF COURSE THERE ARE.

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:35.209 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S

01:43:34.275 --> 01:43:36.744 region:rollup2
PROP TWO A NINE I COULD HAVE A

01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:37.244 region:rollup2
WHOLE SEPARATE SEMINAR IN ON

01:43:36.744 --> 01:43:38.779 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:43:37.244 --> 01:43:40.114 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:43:38.779 --> 01:43:41.148 region:rollup2
THE HEART OF TARGETED

01:43:40.114 --> 01:43:42.149 region:rollup2
UNIVERSALISM IS ACTUALLY

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:43.617 region:rollup2
TARGETING INSTITUTIONS AND

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:44.952 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES.

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:46.053 region:rollup2
SO I CAN GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:47.855 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:49.590 region:rollup2
.

01:43:47.855 --> 01:43:50.758 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PLACES

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:52.259 region:rollup2
THAT HAS OPERATIONALIZED ORGAN

01:43:50.758 --> 01:43:53.828 region:rollup2
VERSOS AND IS THE CITY OF AUSTIN

01:43:52.259 --> 01:43:55.763 region:rollup2
AND TEXAS.

01:43:53.828 --> 01:43:57.264 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY

01:43:55.763 --> 01:43:58.432 region:rollup2
DIDN'T ASSESSMENT AND THEIR GOAL

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:59.934 region:rollup2
WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

01:43:58.432 --> 01:44:01.669 region:rollup2
RESIDENT IN THE CITY.

01:43:59.934 --> 01:44:03.738 region:rollup2
LIVE WITHIN OUR HAD ACCESS TO

01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:04.705 region:rollup2
GREEN SPACE AND LIVE COULD COULD

01:44:03.738 --> 01:44:06.040 region:rollup2
LIVE WITH AND A HALF OR A

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:07.508 region:rollup2
QUARTER MILE. OF OF THE PUBLIC

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.343 region:rollup2
PARK

01:44:07.508 --> 01:44:10.878 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY THEY CREATED GIS MAP

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:12.079 region:rollup2
IN THE ASSESSED WHERE RESIDENTS

01:44:10.878 --> 01:44:14.081 region:rollup2
LIVE RELATIVE TO THE GREEN

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:15.416 region:rollup2
SPACES AND THEY CREATED NEW

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:16.784 region:rollup2
GREEN SPACES RIGHT. THAT'S THE

01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:18.486 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH AS

01:44:16.784 --> 01:44:19.920 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO MOVING PEOPLE YOU

01:44:18.486 --> 01:44:22.022 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CREATE GREEN SPACE

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:24.058 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE ARE SO THE FOCUS

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:24.959 region:rollup2
ISN'T ON PEOPLE PER SE IT'S

01:44:24.058 --> 01:44:26.761 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ON THE INSTITUTION

01:44:24.959 --> 01:44:27.795 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE CONSISTS.

01:44:26.761 --> 01:44:29.163 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

01:44:27.795 --> 01:44:30.531 region:rollup2
.

01:44:29.163 --> 01:44:31.699 region:rollup2
THE TARGET REVERSALS APPROACH

01:44:30.531 --> 01:44:33.400 region:rollup2
ALWAYS TARGETS.

01:44:31.699 --> 01:44:34.735 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS ARE STRUCTURES.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.504 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A PROGRAM A VERY

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:37.071 region:rollup2
VALUABLE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED IN

01:44:36.504 --> 01:44:38.639 region:rollup2
BALTIMORE CALLED VISION FOR

01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:39.874 region:rollup2
BALTIMORE.

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:41.242 region:rollup2
IS A PROGRAM LAUNCHED BY THE

01:44:39.874 --> 01:44:42.409 region:rollup2
CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. BASED ON

01:44:41.242 --> 01:44:43.778 region:rollup2
A RECOGNITION THAT FIFTEEN

01:44:42.409 --> 01:44:46.714 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:47.448 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHO NEEDED. A MEDICAL

01:44:46.714 --> 01:44:48.916 region:rollup2
CARE SPECIFICALLY NEED THAT

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:50.384 region:rollup2
NEEDED CONTACT LENSES OR GLASSES

01:44:48.916 --> 01:44:51.418 region:rollup2
WEREN'T GETTING AS YOU CAN

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:52.920 region:rollup2
IMAGINE HOW THAT.

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:54.321 region:rollup2
WAS A BARRIER TO ACTUALLY

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.956 region:rollup2
LEARNING.

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:57.091 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY PROVIDED HEALTHCARE

01:44:55.956 --> 01:44:59.760 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT BOTH SCREEN AND

01:44:57.091 --> 01:45:01.629 region:rollup2
THEN PROVIDED THAT.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.697 region:rollup2
THE PROVIDED THAT RESOURCE.

01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:05.432 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT CASE YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:07.201 region:rollup2
CREATING INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAM

01:45:05.432 --> 01:45:08.502 region:rollup2
THAT DOES TARGET PEOPLE BUT

01:45:07.201 --> 01:45:09.603 region:rollup2
THE POINT IS THAT MORE OFTEN

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:11.005 region:rollup2
THAN NOT A TARGET REVERSALS OF

01:45:09.603 --> 01:45:14.542 region:rollup2
APPROACH WILL FOCUS ON SYSTEMS

01:45:11.005 --> 01:45:15.976 region:rollup2
AND STRUCTURES AND INSTITUTIONS.

01:45:14.542 --> 01:45:17.411 region:rollup2
FINALLY IN IMPLEMENTING A TARGET

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:18.712 region:rollup2
REVERSALS APPROACH.

01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:20.648 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOT JUST

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:22.349 region:rollup2
BRING TOGETHER THE EXPERTS.

01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:23.918 region:rollup2
AND THE LEGISLATORS AND THE

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:25.019 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONERS BUT YOU ACTUALLY

01:45:23.918 --> 01:45:26.587 region:rollup2
BRING TO GO THE PEOPLE FROM THE

01:45:25.019 --> 01:45:27.955 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE AFFECTED.

WEEK KIND OF. FIGURE OUT THIS IS

01:46:21.609 --> 01:46:24.278 region:rollup2
WHAT PEOPLE NEED WITHOUT

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:44.298 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY LEARNED ABOUT

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:45.833 region:rollup2
TARGETED UNIVERSALISM.

01:46:44.298 --> 01:46:47.668 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE BROUGHT A GROUP

01:46:45.833 --> 01:46:49.303 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO LOOK AT WHAT IT

01:46:47.668 --> 01:46:52.473 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE TO BRING A RACE CLASS

01:46:49.303 --> 01:46:55.276 region:rollup2
AND GENDER ANALYSIS TO THE EASY.

01:46:52.473 --> 01:46:56.377 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND IT WAS OUR INCREDIBLE

IT SO OFTEN THE CONVERSATION OR

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:06.487 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING.

01:47:04.618 --> 01:47:08.022 region:rollup2
AND.

01:47:06.487 --> 01:47:10.057 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES WE ARE CREATING

01:47:08.022 --> 01:47:11.525 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT THE VERY PEOPLE

01:47:10.057 --> 01:47:14.194 region:rollup2
WHO WERE TRYING TO TARGET. UP

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:16.163 region:rollup2
CANNOT GET TO AND THEN WE

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:18.699 region:rollup2
PENALIZE THEM AND WE DEMONIZED

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:21.001 region:rollup2
THEM FOR SOMEHOW NOT.

01:47:18.699 --> 01:47:22.136 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUMPING OVER OR THROUGH

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:25.205 region:rollup2
OR UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:47:22.136 --> 01:47:26.907 region:rollup2
HOOPS TO GET TO IT AND I REALLY.

01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:28.676 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMISSION IS

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:28.943 region:rollup2
REALLY COMMITTED TO TAKING THIS

01:47:28.676 --> 01:47:31.011 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:47:28.943 --> 01:47:31.679 region:rollup2
.

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:32.846 region:rollup2
I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:35.082 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

01:47:32.846 --> 01:47:37.451 region:rollup2
AND THAT A FUTURE SYSTEM REALLY

01:47:35.082 --> 01:47:39.486 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS AND UNDERSTANDS WHAT.

01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:40.421 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS ARE OF AB WHO WE ARE

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:42.723 region:rollup2
TRYING TO TARGET.

01:47:40.421 --> 01:47:44.758 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION TO YOU.

01:47:42.723 --> 01:47:46.427 region:rollup2
.

01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:47.261 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE SHOULD WE.

01:47:46.427 --> 01:47:48.996 region:rollup2
START.

01:47:47.261 --> 01:47:50.698 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT A NEEDS

01:47:48.996 --> 01:47:52.700 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:47:50.698 --> 01:47:56.670 region:rollup2
DOING FOCUS GROUPS OF FAMILIES.

01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:58.872 region:rollup2
IF YOU WERE YOU KNOW.

01:47:56.670 --> 01:48:00.607 region:rollup2
ADVICE EVEN THIS COMMISSION WILL

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:01.909 region:rollup2
I GUESS YOU ARE HOME WHERE WHERE

01:48:00.607 --> 01:48:05.312 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU TELL US TO START.

01:48:01.909 --> 01:48:06.747 region:rollup2
YES.

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:08.282 region:rollup2
I THINK BOTH OF THOSE PLACES ARE

01:48:06.747 --> 01:48:09.650 region:rollup2
VITAL STARTING POINTS AND YOU

01:48:08.282 --> 01:48:10.985 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T DO ONE

01:48:09.650 --> 01:48:12.052 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE OTHER.

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:13.387 region:rollup2
HE NEEDED YOU NEED TO LOOK AT

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:15.622 region:rollup2
THE DATA AND SEE WHERE THE

01:48:13.387 --> 01:48:16.256 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS ARE THE SUBGROUP

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:17.825 region:rollup2
RELATIONS ARE WITHIN THE STATE

01:48:16.256 --> 01:48:19.560 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE

01:48:17.825 --> 01:48:21.362 region:rollup2
TO DO THE QUALITATIVE SIDE YOU

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.030 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MEET WITH GROUPS.

01:48:21.362 --> 01:48:24.465 region:rollup2
AND FIND OUT IS YOUR SPECIAL YOU

01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:26.400 region:rollup2
DEVISED THE STRATEGIES YOU KNOW

01:48:24.465 --> 01:48:27.768 region:rollup2
WHAT OF THE ACTUAL BARRIERS AND

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.436 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THAT ARE ALLOWING

01:48:27.768 --> 01:48:29.970 region:rollup2
SOME GROUPS TO ADVANCE THE

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:36.510 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL GOAL AND HOLDING

01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:40.247 region:rollup2
OTHERS BACK.

01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:42.549 region:rollup2
THANK YOU COMMISSIONER MCMILLAN.

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:44.184 region:rollup2
THE THANK YOU FOR THAT I HAD

01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:45.986 region:rollup2
NEVER HEARD OF TARGET

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:46.553 region:rollup2
UNIVERSALISM SO YOU.

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:49.923 region:rollup2
JUST EDUCATED ME ON THAT AND

01:48:46.553 --> 01:48:51.625 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:48:49.923 --> 01:48:53.093 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT BEEN A PART OF THE

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:56.130 region:rollup2
LABOR MOVEMENT.

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:57.364 region:rollup2
WE COULD NOT ARE ALREADY DOING

01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:59.767 region:rollup2
THAT ESPECIALLY WOULD FAMILY

01:48:57.364 --> 01:49:02.369 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE BECAUSE WE WORK OUT OF

01:48:59.767 --> 01:49:04.238 region:rollup2
OUR HOMES AND SO FOR US TO.

01:49:02.369 --> 01:49:05.839 region:rollup2
EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT OUR UNION

01:49:04.238 --> 01:49:07.074 region:rollup2
AND AND AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

01:49:05.839 --> 01:49:09.043 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO BE.

01:49:07.074 --> 01:49:10.744 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO BE BROUGHT TO US.

01:49:09.043 --> 01:49:13.580 region:rollup2
IS THAT HOW IT WORKS IN MY IN MY

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:15.816 region:rollup2
DOING A GOOD COMPARISON OR AM I

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:17.017 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:49:15.816 --> 01:49:19.186 region:rollup2
WHAT I HAVE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:20.287 region:rollup2
MORE BUT I I THINK THAT?

01:49:19.186 --> 01:49:21.488 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING

01:49:20.287 --> 01:49:22.823 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT TO GET EVERYONE TO

01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:24.324 region:rollup2
THE GO TO THE UNIVERSAL GOAL

01:49:22.823 --> 01:49:26.060 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A MULTITUDE OF

01:49:24.324 --> 01:49:27.895 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES. AND ONE SIZE

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:28.962 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOES NOT FIT ALL AND

01:49:27.895 --> 01:49:30.431 region:rollup2
THAT ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH

01:49:28.962 --> 01:49:32.132 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST

01:49:30.431 --> 01:49:33.133 region:rollup2
SINGULAR UNIVERSAL CAN ACTUALLY

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:34.768 region:rollup2
EXACERBATE INEQUALITY CAN MAKE

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:38.072 region:rollup2
THINGS WORSE.

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:38.605 region:rollup2
AND SO I I APPRECIATED WHAT.

01:49:38.072 --> 01:49:39.406 region:rollup2
I GUESS I HAD TO SAY ABOUT

01:49:38.605 --> 01:49:41.375 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:42.609 region:rollup2
.

01:49:41.375 --> 01:49:43.977 region:rollup2
HARMONIZING APPROACHES BUT ALSO

01:49:42.609 --> 01:49:44.545 region:rollup2
BEING FLEXIBLE AS

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:44.878 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT I HEARD I THINK

01:49:44.545 --> 01:49:46.847 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:48.615 region:rollup2
.

01:49:46.847 --> 01:49:50.350 region:rollup2
THE TRICK THOUGH WITH TARGETING

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:51.718 region:rollup2
REVERSALS IN IS THAT.

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:52.719 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY JUST TARGETED

01:49:51.718 --> 01:49:54.154 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:55.889 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSAL GOAL.

01:49:54.154 --> 01:49:57.624 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK ABOUT INEQUALITY WE

01:49:55.889 --> 01:49:58.992 region:rollup2
OFTEN FOCUS ON GETTING SAY WHAT

01:49:57.624 --> 01:50:00.727 region:rollup2
LATIN NEXT TUNES FOR AFRICAN

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:02.729 region:rollup2
AMERICAN STUDENTS TO WEAR WHITE

01:50:00.727 --> 01:50:03.964 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE. BUT IN MANY PLACES

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:05.365 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WHITE STUDENTS HAVE

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:06.800 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THE GOAL. RIGHT WE'RE

01:50:05.365 --> 01:50:07.701 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET EVERYONE TO

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:09.136 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL GOAL.

01:50:07.701 --> 01:50:11.972 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S THERE REALLY IS THE

01:50:09.136 --> 01:50:12.606 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BETWEEN TARGETING.

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:13.240 region:rollup2
WHICH MIGHT IN ON SOME PLEASE

01:50:12.606 --> 01:50:15.142 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:16.577 region:rollup2
STRATEGY AND ACTUALLY GETTING

01:50:15.142 --> 01:50:18.846 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO THE UNIVERSAL GOAL

01:50:16.577 --> 01:50:20.047 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS CREATING SUPPORTS.

01:50:18.846 --> 01:50:21.682 region:rollup2
IN THE LATTER'S IN THE IN THE

01:50:20.047 --> 01:50:23.217 region:rollup2
CAPACITIES TO DO THAT.

01:50:21.682 --> 01:50:25.652 region:rollup2
SO IF I THINK I THINK YOU'RE

01:50:23.217 --> 01:50:27.454 region:rollup2
THERE SO YOU REALLY ARE SHIFTING

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:28.689 region:rollup2
A PARADIGM SO TO SPEAK SO THAT'S

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:31.725 region:rollup2
RIGHT SIDE BRING IN THAT

01:50:28.689 --> 01:50:33.093 region:rollup2
DARTBOARD TO THE DARK. IN SOME

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:35.362 region:rollup2
CASES IT CAN MODOC PLAYOFFS ON

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:40.968 region:rollup2
US.

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:42.236 region:rollup2
OKAY YEAH I THINK THANK YOU.

01:51:27.247 --> 01:51:31.652 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW TO. TO GIVE A MODEL

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:33.720 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WITHIN

01:51:31.652 --> 01:51:36.089 region:rollup2
TEMAS OF HOW TO EXPAND.

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:38.492 region:rollup2

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:42.296 region:rollup2
SO I JUST SOME CONTEXT

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:43.397 region:rollup2

SAN FRANCISCO'S A LITTLE IS

01:51:43.397 --> 01:51:47.134 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHERE PRETTY

01:51:44.831 --> 01:51:48.502 region:rollup2
UNIQUE AT PLACES WHERE BOTH YOU

01:51:47.134 --> 01:51:49.770 region:rollup2

01:51:48.502 --> 01:51:50.938 region:rollup2
AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE SCHOOL

01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:51.305 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:51:50.938 --> 01:51:52.806 region:rollup2
AND WE DO HAVE.

01:51:51.305 --> 01:51:54.942 region:rollup2
.

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:56.343 region:rollup2
I SOME SIGNIFICANT AT A LOCAL

01:51:54.942 --> 01:51:57.344 region:rollup2

DEL SET ASIDES THAT COME TO E.

01:52:03.283 --> 01:52:06.353 region:rollup2
C. E. SPECIFICALLY SO WE HAVE A

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:08.121 region:rollup2
LOT OF LOCAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE

01:52:06.353 --> 01:52:09.856 region:rollup2
CAN USE WHICH I ISN'T ALWAYS THE

01:52:08.121 --> 01:52:10.691 region:rollup2
CASE IN AND OTHER COUNTIES.

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:12.192 region:rollup2
I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF

01:52:10.691 --> 01:52:14.895 region:rollup2
THIS I THINK YOU ALL KNOW WHERE

01:52:12.192 --> 01:52:15.696 region:rollup2
A HIGH COST COUNTY RENTS ARE

01:52:14.895 --> 01:52:18.298 region:rollup2
RIDICULOUS.

01:52:15.696 --> 01:52:20.267 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:20.500 region:rollup2
TO DO BUSINESS THERE AND TO LIVE

01:52:20.267 --> 01:52:22.836 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:24.338 region:rollup2

01:52:28.208 --> 01:52:31.078 region:rollup2
THEY TOOK IT A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:32.546 region:rollup2

INCOME OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE

01:52:32.546 --> 01:52:36.550 region:rollup2

THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME WHICH IS

01:53:06.246 --> 01:53:08.982 region:rollup2

YOU LOOK AT THE AIR MY AS

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:11.985 region:rollup2

TO TWO.

01:53:27.701 --> 01:53:30.003 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THREE TO

01:53:28.268 --> 01:53:31.638 region:rollup2
FIVE RIGHT.

01:53:30.003 --> 01:53:32.439 region:rollup2

OUR EAT THE INCOME IS.

01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:41.014 region:rollup2
HIGHER CORRECT SO DIRECT.

01:53:38.979 --> 01:53:43.116 region:rollup2
SO AND THEN THE GREEN HERE AS

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:43.750 region:rollup2
ABOVE FAMILIES WITH INCOME ABOVE

01:53:43.116 --> 01:53:44.951 region:rollup2

I.

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:47.921 region:rollup2
SO CURRENTLY THAT THE FACT THAT

01:53:46.253 --> 01:53:49.489 region:rollup2
THE TARGET AUTAUGA POPULATION

01:53:47.921 --> 01:53:51.024 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR WITH OUR SYSTEM THAT

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:51.725 region:rollup2
WE FUNDING LOCALLY JUST BECAUSE

01:53:51.024 --> 01:53:53.527 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH OUR.

01:53:51.725 --> 01:53:55.362 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT COME THAT WE HAVE

01:53:53.527 --> 01:53:56.663 region:rollup2
LOCALLY FATS FLEXIBLE WE DON'T

01:53:55.362 --> 01:53:59.032 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH TO SERVE EVERY

01:53:56.663 --> 01:54:01.134 region:rollup2
SINGLE UNIT YOU KNOW UNIVERSAL.

01:53:59.032 --> 01:54:02.969 region:rollup2
IN FROM TOTAL OF ZERO TO FIVE

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:05.105 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOL ACCESS WE DON'T HAVE

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:07.240 region:rollup2
THAT SO AGAIN ARE TARGETED OUR

01:54:05.105 --> 01:54:09.643 region:rollup2
TARGET IS UP TWO HUNDRED AND TEN

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:12.679 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF AT MY WITHIN OUR

01:54:09.643 --> 01:54:14.347 region:rollup2
FUNDING SYSTEM.

01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:15.749 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS OUR OUR OVER ACHIEVED

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:17.384 region:rollup2
GOALS REALLY OUGHT TO INCREASE

01:54:15.749 --> 01:54:19.019 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO THE PROGRAMS TO

01:54:17.384 --> 01:54:20.754 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TO TO REALLY COVER THE

01:54:19.019 --> 01:54:21.955 region:rollup2
CUT THE ACTUAL COST OF PROVIDING

01:54:20.754 --> 01:54:22.856 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY CARE WE KNOW THAT A

01:54:21.955 --> 01:54:24.524 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:54:22.856 --> 01:54:26.593 region:rollup2
RECEIVING SOME YOU KNOW. FUNDING

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:27.627 region:rollup2
FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE FADS

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:29.029 region:rollup2
THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES A

01:54:27.627 --> 01:54:30.897 region:rollup2
DALY REIMBURSEMENTS JUST DON'T

01:54:29.029 --> 01:54:32.199 region:rollup2
GO ANYWHERE NEAR A MILLION THE

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:34.334 region:rollup2
COST OF ACTUALLY PROVIDING HIGH

01:54:32.199 --> 01:54:35.202 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF CARE. AND ONE OF THE

01:54:34.334 --> 01:54:37.237 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WERE REALLY LOOKING

01:54:35.202 --> 01:54:39.005 region:rollup2
FOR IS LOOKING FOR CONTINUITY OF

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:41.007 region:rollup2
CARE THAT ONCE A CHILD'S AND

01:54:39.005 --> 01:54:42.976 region:rollup2
DOES THE SYSTEM AT ANY AGE FROM

01:54:41.007 --> 01:54:45.011 region:rollup2
ZERO TO FIVE. THAT WE WILL

01:54:42.976 --> 01:54:48.181 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE FUNDING FOR THAT

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:49.382 region:rollup2
FAMILY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:50.383 region:rollup2
WHENEVER THE END OF THE SYSTEM

01:54:49.382 --> 01:54:51.585 region:rollup2

SOURCES FOR FAMILIES AND

01:54:57.591 --> 01:55:01.294 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:03.230 region:rollup2
THAT FAMILIES LOSE A. LEASE

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:04.965 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES A LOSE ACCESS AND THEN

01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:06.666 region:rollup2

01:55:04.965 --> 01:55:08.135 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LOSES THEIR THEIR

01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:09.136 region:rollup2

WANT TO TRY TO ASSIST MORE

01:56:32.786 --> 01:56:36.189 region:rollup2
MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES BECAUSE

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:37.457 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE ELIGIBILITY OR

01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:39.392 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEVELS WILL HE DOESN'T

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:42.495 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY WORK FOR. FOR THE

01:56:39.392 --> 01:56:44.264 region:rollup2
REALITY OF SOME OF OUR FAMILIES

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:46.032 region:rollup2
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

01:56:44.264 --> 01:56:47.067 region:rollup2
SO I WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:48.235 region:rollup2
I JUST WHEN YOU KNOW THAT WE

01:56:47.067 --> 01:56:49.569 region:rollup2
HAVE A CITY WIDE PLANNED FOR

01:56:48.235 --> 01:56:50.770 region:rollup2
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION THAT

01:56:49.569 --> 01:56:51.905 region:rollup2
WAS OF THERE WAS A HUGE

01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:53.206 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY PROCESS I THINK A

GUIDING STAR.

01:57:02.916 --> 01:57:05.852 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S THE ONE THING I

01:57:04.451 --> 01:57:07.587 region:rollup2

WITH A LOT OF FEEDBACK A LOT OF

01:57:23.837 --> 01:57:26.473 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY INPUT BEFORE WE MOVE

01:57:25.472 --> 01:57:27.874 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH OUR EARLY LEARNING

01:57:26.473 --> 01:57:30.610 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIP.

01:57:27.874 --> 01:57:32.913 region:rollup2
WE ARE FUNDING SYSTEM AND THAT

01:57:30.610 --> 01:57:35.048 region:rollup2
WAS LAUNCHED JUST IN JULY LAST

01:57:32.913 --> 01:57:38.852 region:rollup2

01:57:35.048 --> 01:57:39.719 region:rollup2
YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION SO IT'S.

01:57:38.852 --> 01:57:41.321 region:rollup2

SO THIS AGAIN IS ARE SOME OF THE

01:57:42.756 --> 01:57:46.026 region:rollup2
CITYWIDE PLAN OUR STRATEGIC

01:57:44.724 --> 01:57:47.794 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THAT GUIDES ALL WORK

01:57:46.026 --> 01:57:48.795 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:50.931 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TOP

01:57:56.269 --> 01:58:00.240 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE AND THE FINANCING

01:57:58.338 --> 01:58:01.241 region:rollup2
MODELS AND THE FINANCING MODEL

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:03.043 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY HOURS ARE ONLY

01:58:01.241 --> 01:58:05.679 region:rollup2
GOING SCHOLARSHIP. PROVIDING

01:58:03.043 --> 01:58:07.847 region:rollup2

AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE

01:58:08.615 --> 01:58:12.786 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON TODAY.

01:58:11.051 --> 01:58:13.987 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ARE TOLD ABOUT THIS

01:58:12.786 --> 01:58:15.488 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF OUR OWN

01:58:13.987 --> 01:58:17.557 region:rollup2
OVER ARCHING GOALS AS WE DON'T

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:19.326 region:rollup2
WANT DISQUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:21.428 region:rollup2
ARE GOING OVER THE INCOME LEVEL

01:58:19.326 --> 01:58:23.496 region:rollup2
FOR. FOR ELIGIBILITY TO BE A

01:58:21.428 --> 01:58:25.265 region:rollup2
BARRIER TO TO COME TO CONTINUITY

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:26.366 region:rollup2
OF CARE SO ONE OF OUR REAL.

01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:29.202 region:rollup2
.

01:58:26.366 --> 01:58:31.504 region:rollup2
OVERARCHING SORT OF FRAMEWORK IS

01:58:29.202 --> 01:58:35.108 region:rollup2
URINE UP TALK IN THE GARDEN AND

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:36.977 region:rollup2
YOU NO MATTER WHAT.

01:58:35.108 --> 01:58:38.278 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS HIGH

01:58:36.977 --> 01:58:39.713 region:rollup2
QUALITY E. C. E. COST IN SAN

01:58:38.278 --> 01:58:41.948 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO.

01:58:39.713 --> 01:58:42.315 region:rollup2
WELL IT MIGHT NOT THIS IS THIS

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:44.317 region:rollup2
IS SORT OF OUR.

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:46.753 region:rollup2
.

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:47.954 region:rollup2
THE OVERARCHING KIND OF IDEA

01:58:46.753 --> 01:58:49.556 region:rollup2
BEHIND WHAT ARE ONLY LETTING

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:51.291 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIP BASS.

01:58:49.556 --> 01:58:52.926 region:rollup2
SO WOULD HAVE CENTER RATES AND

01:58:51.291 --> 01:58:54.227 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FAMILY CHILDCARE RIGHTS

01:58:52.926 --> 01:58:56.563 region:rollup2

01:58:54.227 --> 01:58:57.831 region:rollup2
FISCAL ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE BY

01:58:56.563 --> 01:58:59.532 region:rollup2

ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WENT INTO

01:59:08.208 --> 01:59:11.144 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IT COSTS TO PROVIDE

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:14.881 region:rollup2
THINK A NINE MONTH PROCESS WHERE

01:59:14.314 --> 01:59:15.882 region:rollup2
WE DID THIS REALLY INTENSIVE

01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:18.685 region:rollup2
STE.

01:59:15.882 --> 01:59:21.721 region:rollup2

PAGES.

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:25.959 region:rollup2

THESE BENCHMARK RATES FOR EACH

SANTA AND FCC.

01:59:29.696 --> 01:59:33.933 region:rollup2
SO FOR INFANTS

01:59:31.331 --> 01:59:36.436 region:rollup2
OUR ANNUAL RATE WOULD BE A HIGH

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:38.371 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND ARE A BENCHMARK IS

01:59:36.436 --> 01:59:39.739 region:rollup2
T. IF THREE OF THE. STATE Q. R.

S.

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:43.309 region:rollup2
SO IS A YOU KNOW TO BE ELIGIBLE

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:43.643 region:rollup2
TO BE ANOTHER LEADING

LIVES A GUARANTEE THAT YOU AYE

01:59:51.951 --> 01:59:55.789 region:rollup2
THAT ALREADY AT TI A THREE OF

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:57.257 region:rollup2
THE CURE I S. OR. FOR FAMILY

01:59:55.789 --> 01:59:58.525 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT DICK

01:59:58.525 --> 02:00:02.429 region:rollup2
CURIOUS CERTAINLY IS NOT AS

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:04.164 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE AND.

02:00:02.429 --> 02:00:05.732 region:rollup2
IT MAY REQUIRE MORE TIME THERE

02:00:04.164 --> 02:00:07.267 region:rollup2
WAS A COMMIT A COMMITTED A

02:00:05.732 --> 02:00:09.569 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO MOVE TOWARDS TO

02:00:07.267 --> 02:00:11.704 region:rollup2

SO WHERE USING TEAR THREE IS A

02:00:12.605 --> 02:00:16.076 region:rollup2
BASELINE SO WHAT WOULD IT COST

02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:17.544 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE TIER THREE QUALITY E.

02:00:16.076 --> 02:00:19.913 region:rollup2
C. E. IN BOTH CENTERS AND FROM

WHICH OUT THERE. AND FOR CENTERS

02:00:19.913 --> 02:00:24.217 region:rollup2
AT WIRED FOR INFINITE WAS TWENTY

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:25.085 region:rollup2
SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND

02:00:24.217 --> 02:00:27.053 region:rollup2
SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:00:25.085 --> 02:00:28.354 region:rollup2
FOR A TABLA IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND

02:00:27.053 --> 02:00:30.423 region:rollup2
NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE

02:00:28.354 --> 02:00:32.058 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A YEAR AND FOR PRESCHOOL

02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:33.660 region:rollup2
IT WAS SEVENTEEN THOUSAND AND

02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:34.661 region:rollup2
SIXTY NINE DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:36.696 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE ALREADY GETTING

02:00:34.661 --> 02:00:38.765 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK FROM OUR.

02:00:36.696 --> 02:00:40.200 region:rollup2
NETWORK THAT DUTCH NEWMAN HAAS.

02:00:38.765 --> 02:00:42.135 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE RIGHTS ARE NOT ENOUGH

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:43.736 region:rollup2
AND STILL DON'T MATCH THE COST

02:00:42.135 --> 02:00:45.238 region:rollup2
OF ACTUALLY PROVIDING HIGH

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:46.673 region:rollup2
QUALITY CARE IN A COUNTY LIKE

02:00:45.238 --> 02:00:48.842 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO.

02:00:46.673 --> 02:00:51.311 region:rollup2
SO FOR SOME OF OUR.

02:00:48.842 --> 02:00:53.213 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN THE CITY THAT DON'T

02:00:51.311 --> 02:00:55.248 region:rollup2
A QUALIFY FOR ANY OF ITS FEDERAL

02:00:53.213 --> 02:00:57.183 region:rollup2
STATE SUBSIDIES WE WILL PROVIDE

02:00:55.248 --> 02:00:59.753 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS LOCALLY FUNDED VOUCHERS

02:00:57.183 --> 02:01:01.354 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PAY THAT FULL RIGHT

02:00:59.753 --> 02:01:03.123 region:rollup2
OF THOSE AMOUNTS UP TO CHEER

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:05.058 region:rollup2
THAT TIA THREE BASE RIGHT.

02:01:03.123 --> 02:01:06.593 region:rollup2
FOR FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE

02:01:05.058 --> 02:01:10.330 region:rollup2
RECEIVING SUBSIDIES FROM IF

02:01:06.593 --> 02:01:12.132 region:rollup2
TITLE FIVE OR HEAD START OR ST

02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:13.700 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS THE CAL EXPENDITURES WE

02:01:12.132 --> 02:01:15.301 region:rollup2
WILL PAY THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT

02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:18.271 region:rollup2
THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS FROM

02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:20.006 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S. UP TO THAT TF THREE

02:01:18.271 --> 02:01:21.541 region:rollup2
LOCAL RIGHT

02:01:20.006 --> 02:01:23.409 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ABOUT GAP FUNDING TO

02:01:21.541 --> 02:01:25.411 region:rollup2
BRING EVERYBODY UP TO THAT THAT

02:01:23.409 --> 02:01:27.514 region:rollup2
SAME AMOUNT PER CHILD.

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:29.082 region:rollup2
FOR HEAD START AFTER THE BRAID

02:01:27.514 --> 02:01:31.084 region:rollup2
THEM UNPLANNED FUNDING WITH HEAD

02:01:29.082 --> 02:01:33.086 region:rollup2
START AND TITLE FIVE AGAIN WILL

02:01:31.084 --> 02:01:35.522 region:rollup2
BRIDGE THAT GAP SO THEY CAN

02:01:33.086 --> 02:01:36.589 region:rollup2
BRING IT UP TO THE. THE SAN

02:01:35.522 --> 02:01:38.591 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO RIGHT

02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:41.094 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW I ALSO WE HAVE

02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:41.327 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL PFA FOUGHT THAT IS NOT

02:01:41.094 --> 02:01:43.930 region:rollup2
INCOME.

02:01:41.327 --> 02:01:45.632 region:rollup2
BASED AND WE STILL HAVE TUITION

02:01:43.930 --> 02:01:47.867 region:rollup2
CREDIT FOR FAMILIES REGARDLESS

02:01:45.632 --> 02:01:49.435 region:rollup2
OF INCOME FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:51.137 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR PRESCHOOL FOR ALL.

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:52.906 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S KIND OF ARE WE ARE

02:01:51.137 --> 02:01:54.440 region:rollup2
GOAL EVENTUALLY IS TO GET TWO

02:01:52.906 --> 02:01:57.477 region:rollup2
TIERED REIMBURSEMENTS FOR BOTH

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:59.212 region:rollup2
TF FOR ANTI A FIVE. A IN THE

02:01:57.477 --> 02:02:00.346 region:rollup2
CURIOUS WE'RE NOT THERE YET

02:01:59.212 --> 02:02:02.315 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:04.751 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

02:02:02.315 --> 02:02:06.653 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY.

02:02:04.751 --> 02:02:07.220 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A LOT OF THOSE LITTLE

02:02:06.653 --> 02:02:09.422 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I DIDN'T PUT IN.

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:11.891 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:13.459 region:rollup2
YEAH. SO I AGAIN I THINK THIS IS

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:14.928 region:rollup2
FOR YOUHAVE THIS IN YOUR

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:16.196 region:rollup2
HANDOUTS IT SHOWS YOU THE RIGHTS

02:02:14.928 --> 02:02:17.997 region:rollup2
ONE THING I JUST WANT TO

02:02:16.196 --> 02:02:19.532 region:rollup2

CONTINUITY OF CARE.

02:07:37.416 --> 02:07:41.020 region:rollup2

ACROSS THE BOARD TO CAPTURE

02:07:44.357 --> 02:07:45.191 region:rollup2
ABOUT DATA REALLY.

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:46.692 region:rollup2
.

02:07:45.191 --> 02:07:47.994 region:rollup2
SIMPLY

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:49.829 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HAD SOME BRIGHT SPOTS

02:07:47.994 --> 02:07:51.464 region:rollup2
WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR OUR

02:07:49.829 --> 02:07:53.966 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY HOMELESS

02:07:51.464 --> 02:07:54.567 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND FOR INFANTS

02:07:53.966 --> 02:07:56.002 region:rollup2
TODDLERS AND WE HAVE A BALLOT

RAISE ANOTHER HUNDRED AND FORTY

02:07:57.169 --> 02:08:00.039 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR ELF

02:07:58.304 --> 02:08:00.673 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:02.942 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE AMAZING IF THAT

02:08:00.673 --> 02:08:04.310 region:rollup2
PASSES.

02:08:02.942 --> 02:08:06.512 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN A MASS OF.

02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:07.079 region:rollup2
SYSTEM CHANGE IN SAN FRANCISCO

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:08.114 region:rollup2
AND NOT HAS NOT BEEN WITHOUT

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:11.450 region:rollup2
ITS.

02:08:08.114 --> 02:08:12.618 region:rollup2
ROCKY ROADS DISPERSED YEAR I

02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:14.854 region:rollup2
THINK WE FOUND THAT WE MOVED

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:16.189 region:rollup2
FROM A FUNDING PER SITE MODEL

02:08:14.854 --> 02:08:17.690 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:19.926 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT EIGHT AREAS

02:08:17.690 --> 02:08:21.460 region:rollup2
OF THE FIELD. SOMETHING FOR A

02:08:19.926 --> 02:08:23.162 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION SOMETHING FOR

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:23.729 region:rollup2
INFANTS AND TODDLERS SOMETHING

02:08:23.162 --> 02:08:26.065 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:27.733 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS

02:08:26.065 --> 02:08:28.701 region:rollup2
WE'VE AMALGAMATED ALL OF THOSE

02:08:27.733 --> 02:08:30.870 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS INTO

02:08:28.701 --> 02:08:33.272 region:rollup2
ONE EARLY LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP

02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:34.507 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A CHILD BASED.

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:36.475 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FEE FOR SERVICE BASED

02:08:34.507 --> 02:08:39.278 region:rollup2
ON CHILDREN ENROLLMENT SO THAT

02:08:36.475 --> 02:08:40.746 region:rollup2
WAS A HUGE SYSTEM SHIFT AND.

02:08:39.278 --> 02:08:42.648 region:rollup2
CHANGE IS DIFFICULT AND THAT

02:08:40.746 --> 02:08:44.217 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WERE CUT WE WILL

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:45.918 region:rollup2
BE IN FUNDED BY THE CITY WHEN WE

02:08:44.217 --> 02:08:47.687 region:rollup2
BROUGHT IN THIS NEW SYSTEM

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:49.021 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY THERE WAS SOME.

02:08:47.687 --> 02:08:49.589 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES TO DOUBT ABOUT

02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:51.357 region:rollup2
CHANGING HOW WE WORK FUND IN

02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:52.692 region:rollup2
THE.

02:08:51.357 --> 02:08:54.493 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

02:08:52.692 --> 02:08:56.329 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T HAVE A VERY LONG

02:08:54.493 --> 02:08:58.331 region:rollup2
TIMELINE FOR PLANNING AND.

02:08:56.329 --> 02:08:59.498 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION SO THAT WAS WE

02:08:58.331 --> 02:09:00.399 region:rollup2
HAD A QUICK TURNAROUNDS ARE ALL

02:08:59.498 --> 02:09:02.468 region:rollup2
HAPPENED WAY TOO QUICKLY.

02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:04.337 region:rollup2
.

02:09:02.468 --> 02:09:05.037 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THIS IDEA YOU KNOW

02:09:04.337 --> 02:09:07.406 region:rollup2
I THINK ARE.

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:09.508 region:rollup2
ARMED SERVICES BY ABOUT

02:09:07.406 --> 02:09:11.911 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT BEGETTING CHILDREN IN

02:09:09.508 --> 02:09:13.813 region:rollup2
SPACE EMPTY SPACES IN PROGRAMS

02:09:11.911 --> 02:09:15.081 region:rollup2
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE WERE

02:09:13.813 --> 02:09:16.849 region:rollup2
ALREADY BUILDING ON OF OUR

02:09:15.081 --> 02:09:18.517 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WASN'T AS EFFICIENT

02:09:16.849 --> 02:09:20.186 region:rollup2
AS WE SHOULD HAVE. BEEN OUR OUR.

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:21.520 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY LIST WE HAD WE

02:09:20.186 --> 02:09:22.622 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE A CENTRALIZED

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:24.290 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY LIST IN SAN

02:09:22.622 --> 02:09:26.459 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO WE HAD WE KEPT THAT ON

02:09:24.290 --> 02:09:28.694 region:rollup2
AFTER THE STATE DEFUNDED THOSE

02:09:26.459 --> 02:09:30.496 region:rollup2
AND SO OUR SYSTEM DOES WASN'T

02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:32.198 region:rollup2
READY FOR THIS NEW CHANGE A IN

02:09:30.496 --> 02:09:34.934 region:rollup2
THIS AND ASSIST THEM IN THIS

02:09:32.198 --> 02:09:37.069 region:rollup2
SPAWNING. A SYSTEM AND SO WE HAD

02:09:34.934 --> 02:09:38.004 region:rollup2
SOME YOU KNOW WE HAD SOME.

02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:38.904 region:rollup2
.

02:09:38.004 --> 02:09:40.273 region:rollup2
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS IT WAS WE

02:09:38.904 --> 02:09:41.140 region:rollup2
WERE GETTING CHILDREN THOSE

02:09:40.273 --> 02:09:42.742 region:rollup2
EMPTY SPACES AS QUICKLY AS WE

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:44.176 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE AND SO THAT WAS A

02:09:42.742 --> 02:09:45.878 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A CHALLENGE.

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:47.713 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THE DATA SYSTEMS I

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:49.649 region:rollup2
THINK OUR.

02:09:47.713 --> 02:09:51.584 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN A CHALLENGING SO WORK

02:09:49.649 --> 02:09:54.453 region:rollup2
ON DATA SYSTEMS ARE WORKING ON

02:09:51.584 --> 02:09:56.088 region:rollup2
YOU ELIGIBILITY LIST.

02:09:54.453 --> 02:09:57.089 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS QUICK SORRY I KNEW

02:09:56.088 --> 02:09:58.257 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE KIND OF RUNNING OUT

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:59.358 region:rollup2
OF TIME BUT THANK YOU.

02:09:58.257 --> 02:10:01.360 region:rollup2
I'LL START OFF WITH WITH A FEW

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:03.195 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:04.897 region:rollup2
I AM THE MIKE HERE SO.

02:10:03.195 --> 02:10:05.965 region:rollup2
I I KINDA BLAND IS THAT

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:08.301 region:rollup2
COMMISSION HAD AND.

02:10:05.965 --> 02:10:11.070 region:rollup2
MY BUDGET AT SO I OVERSEE THAT

02:10:08.301 --> 02:10:11.270 region:rollup2
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR EASY.

02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:12.738 region:rollup2
AND.

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:14.240 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT THE STATE

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:16.042 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN THE RATE

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:17.143 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE AND BASIC YOUR CARE

02:10:16.042 --> 02:10:18.844 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THAT ARE NOW IN SAN

02:10:17.143 --> 02:10:19.645 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO.

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:21.480 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE INCREASED.

02:10:19.645 --> 02:10:23.916 region:rollup2
.

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:25.518 region:rollup2
SLOTS LAST FEW YEARS AS WELL AS.

02:10:23.916 --> 02:10:26.986 region:rollup2
MARGINALLY NOT LARGELY BUT WE'VE

02:10:25.518 --> 02:10:29.221 region:rollup2
INCREASED RATES.

02:10:26.986 --> 02:10:30.923 region:rollup2
AT LAST FEARS AS WELL SO HOW'S

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:33.526 region:rollup2
THAT SORTING OUT IN TRYING TO TO

02:10:30.923 --> 02:10:35.761 region:rollup2
FIND FAMILIES THAT THAT MATCHED

02:10:33.526 --> 02:10:37.396 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THAT WERE.

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:38.664 region:rollup2
PUTTING OUT FROM CD FOR STATE

02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:40.333 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. OUT I MEAN

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:41.967 region:rollup2
I'D THAT'S A INTEGRAL PART OF

02:10:40.333 --> 02:10:43.602 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEM I MEAN THAT BIG THIS

02:10:41.967 --> 02:10:44.904 region:rollup2
I THINK I HOPE THE MAJORITY OF

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:45.871 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS THAT WE WORK WITH

02:10:44.904 --> 02:10:46.972 region:rollup2
THE CENTERS THAT WE WORK WITH AN

02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:48.574 region:rollup2
AYE EE LSI EARLY ON IN

02:10:46.972 --> 02:10:50.042 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIP. OUR TITLE FIVE

02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:52.178 region:rollup2
PROGRAM I GET THAT BUT BUT ARE

ARE ARE UTILIZING ALL THE

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:58.484 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT WE ARE GIVING YOU

02:10:56.682 --> 02:11:00.152 region:rollup2
FROM THE STATE SONS DISTRICT

02:10:58.484 --> 02:11:02.254 region:rollup2
SOME COMMUTER THING. RAMMING A

02:11:00.152 --> 02:11:04.023 region:rollup2
TOUGH TIME WHEN YOU'RE NOT BUT

02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:05.291 region:rollup2
WE DOING BETTER. AND I THINK

02:11:04.023 --> 02:11:06.759 region:rollup2
PART TWO OF THE THINGS I THINK

02:11:05.291 --> 02:11:08.360 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WE SO WE WERE AS A

02:11:06.759 --> 02:11:08.661 region:rollup2
PILOT COUNTY WE'VE BEEN LOOKING

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.196 region:rollup2
AT.

02:11:08.661 --> 02:11:11.497 region:rollup2
EARNINGS OF OUR CONTRACTS VERY

02:11:10.196 --> 02:11:13.466 region:rollup2
VERY CLOSELY OVER THE LAST

02:11:11.497 --> 02:11:14.633 region:rollup2
TWELVE YEARS AND WE'VE SEEN THIS

02:11:13.466 --> 02:11:16.268 region:rollup2
YEAR THAT WE'RE DOING BETTER

02:11:14.633 --> 02:11:18.137 region:rollup2
THAN WE DID LAST YEAR. TO THE

02:11:16.268 --> 02:11:19.438 region:rollup2
THINGS I THINK ONE THE LS THIS

02:11:18.137 --> 02:11:21.474 region:rollup2
THIS REIMBURSEMENT RATE THIS

02:11:19.438 --> 02:11:23.409 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE TO EARN THE CONTRACT

02:11:21.474 --> 02:11:24.577 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S YOU'RE NOT GETTING.

02:11:23.409 --> 02:11:26.378 region:rollup2
THEM THE STATE RIGHT.

02:11:24.577 --> 02:11:28.013 region:rollup2
IS AN INCENTIVE TO TO USE

02:11:26.378 --> 02:11:29.415 region:rollup2
THOUGH TO ENROLL MORE CHILDREN

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:30.783 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF TAKING A LOT OF OUR

02:11:29.415 --> 02:11:32.551 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE MIXED INCOME NOW

02:11:30.783 --> 02:11:34.553 region:rollup2
HAVE FAMILIES THAT PAY FEES AS

02:11:32.551 --> 02:11:36.389 region:rollup2
WELL AND SO REDUCING THEM NUMBER

02:11:34.553 --> 02:11:38.257 region:rollup2
OF PHOEBE OUR FAMILY FEE.

02:11:36.389 --> 02:11:40.059 region:rollup2
FAMILIES BUT TAKEN MORE A TITLE

02:11:38.257 --> 02:11:42.161 region:rollup2
FIVE MORE VOUCHER CHILDREN FOR

02:11:40.059 --> 02:11:43.896 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE BECAUSE WE PAY IN ON TOP

02:11:42.161 --> 02:11:45.231 region:rollup2
OF THAT SO IT'S NOT BECAUSE THAT

02:11:43.896 --> 02:11:47.099 region:rollup2
THAT REIMBURSE ALL RIGHT UP FROM

02:11:45.231 --> 02:11:48.434 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS. IS ENCOURAGING

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:50.269 region:rollup2
THEM TO DO IT BUT BECAUSE WAY

02:11:48.434 --> 02:11:51.804 region:rollup2
HELPING SUPPORT THEM AND MEETING

02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:52.471 region:rollup2
LIKE THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE

02:11:51.804 --> 02:11:53.672 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I

02:11:52.471 --> 02:11:54.473 region:rollup2
THINK HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE OF

02:11:53.672 --> 02:11:56.008 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE STATE.

02:11:54.473 --> 02:11:57.476 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT HAVE CHANGED

02:11:56.008 --> 02:11:59.211 region:rollup2
RECENTLY STATEWIDE WE HAVE

02:11:57.476 --> 02:12:00.346 region:rollup2
TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY ONCE

02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.946 region:rollup2
YOU AND YOUR GOOD FOR TWELVE

02:12:00.346 --> 02:12:02.982 region:rollup2
MONTHS UNLESS THERE'S BEEN A

02:12:00.946 --> 02:12:04.650 region:rollup2
CHANGE YOU KNOW TO THAT OF THE

02:12:02.982 --> 02:12:05.918 region:rollup2
INCOME LEVEL AND FOR IN THE IN

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:07.219 region:rollup2
SOME CISCO WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR

02:12:05.918 --> 02:12:08.854 region:rollup2
MONTH ELIGIBILITY THE SAME AS

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:11.056 region:rollup2
THE PILOT COUNTIES. AND SO I

02:12:08.854 --> 02:12:13.826 region:rollup2
THINK THAT AGAIN THAT THAT.

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:14.860 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON ELIGIBILITY AND AND

02:12:13.826 --> 02:12:16.362 region:rollup2
FAMILY ALL YOUR FAMILY

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:17.863 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY IN TAKING THAT AWAY

02:12:16.362 --> 02:12:19.665 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW

02:12:17.863 --> 02:12:21.834 region:rollup2

02:12:19.665 --> 02:12:22.435 region:rollup2
OF TIME. HAS MEANT BACK AGAIN

02:12:21.834 --> 02:12:24.136 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S MORE.

02:12:22.435 --> 02:12:30.042 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROGRAMS TO

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:30.609 region:rollup2
USE THOSE.

02:12:30.042 --> 02:12:31.343 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE STATE FUNDING

02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:31.911 region:rollup2
OKAY

02:12:31.343 --> 02:12:32.545 region:rollup2

02:39:09.073 --> 02:39:12.676 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF NEGOTIATING

02:39:10.541 --> 02:39:15.546 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY COMPLICATED SYSTEM.

02:39:12.676 --> 02:39:16.747 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE EXPECTING THAT

02:39:15.546 --> 02:39:18.249 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE RESULTS MAY

CAN IS AS YOU'VE BEEN HEARING IT

02:39:25.423 --> 02:39:28.859 region:rollup2
WILL INFORM I THINK

02:39:26.924 --> 02:39:29.593 region:rollup2

USE OUR EXISTING CHILD CARE

02:39:34.598 --> 02:39:40.371 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND WHERE THEY SEE. OF

02:39:38.235 --> 02:39:43.641 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND ALSO.

02:39:40.371 --> 02:39:44.341 region:rollup2
HELPING TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEY

02:39:43.641 --> 02:39:46.944 region:rollup2
GET THEIR INFORMATION.

02:39:44.341 --> 02:39:49.146 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY COMPLEX

02:39:46.944 --> 02:39:51.816 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OVER SYSTEMS ARE WAY TOO.

02:39:49.146 --> 02:39:53.751 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED PROBABLY FOR FOR

02:39:51.816 --> 02:39:56.153 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WHO ARE FACING MULTIPLE

02:39:53.751 --> 02:39:58.823 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN

02:39:56.153 --> 02:40:00.157 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE

02:39:58.823 --> 02:40:02.760 region:rollup2
SOME WERE ALSO LOOKING AT.

02:40:00.157 --> 02:40:05.463 region:rollup2
WHAT IN THE RULES OF INFORMAL

02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:07.031 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS CAN PLAY

02:40:05.463 --> 02:40:08.699 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HELPING PARENTS GET

A COUPLE IN THIS FORM OUT.

02:40:21.679 --> 02:40:25.883 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:40:23.214 --> 02:40:27.118 region:rollup2
DEVELOP FORUMS THAT ARE REALLY

02:40:25.883 --> 02:40:29.453 region:rollup2

PATTERSON WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:09.827 region:rollup2
POLICY ADVOCATES AND I

02:41:08.025 --> 02:41:10.761 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:41:09.827 --> 02:41:12.396 region:rollup2
BRING UP SOMETHING THAT HASN'T

02:41:10.761 --> 02:41:14.131 region:rollup2
BEEN DISCUSSED WHEN IT COMES TO

02:41:12.396 --> 02:41:15.166 region:rollup2
FINANCING CHILD CARE. AND THAT

02:41:14.131 --> 02:41:17.701 region:rollup2
IS FOOD.

02:41:15.166 --> 02:41:18.869 region:rollup2
FOOD IS CENTRAL TO CARING FOR

02:41:17.701 --> 02:41:20.404 region:rollup2
CHILDREN I CAN TELL YOU FIRST

02:41:18.869 --> 02:41:21.772 region:rollup2
HAND AS A FORMER HEAD START

02:41:20.404 --> 02:41:23.507 region:rollup2
TEACHER AND PARENT YOUNG

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:24.708 region:rollup2
CHILDREN FOOD IS NOT OPTIONAL

02:41:23.507 --> 02:41:26.176 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING CARE OF

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:27.778 region:rollup2
KIDS DURING THE DAY.

02:41:26.176 --> 02:41:29.446 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S

02:41:27.778 --> 02:41:31.782 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT KEEPS BEING SEEN

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:33.450 region:rollup2
AS A NICE TO HAVE EXTRA IN THE

02:41:31.782 --> 02:41:35.019 region:rollup2
STATE BUDGET AS OPPOSED TO

02:41:33.450 --> 02:41:36.754 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS COR TO THE

02:41:35.019 --> 02:41:37.721 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OF TAKING CARE OF KIDS.

02:41:36.754 --> 02:41:39.390 region:rollup2
DURING THE DAY WHILE THEIR

02:41:37.721 --> 02:41:40.791 region:rollup2
PARENTS ARE AT WORK AND SO I

02:41:39.390 --> 02:41:42.493 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO THE

02:41:40.791 --> 02:41:44.428 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT

02:41:42.493 --> 02:41:46.430 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE HAVE AN ADEQUATELY

02:41:44.428 --> 02:41:48.098 region:rollup2
FUNDED CHILD CARE FOOD PROGRAM

02:41:46.430 --> 02:41:49.733 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:41:48.098 --> 02:41:51.502 region:rollup2
SINCE WE CUT STATE FUNDING

02:41:49.733 --> 02:41:53.270 region:rollup2
DURING DURING THE RECESSION WE

02:41:51.502 --> 02:41:54.471 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT GOTTEN IT BACK AND

02:41:53.270 --> 02:41:56.207 region:rollup2
CHILD POVERTY RATES AT THIS

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:57.441 region:rollup2
POINT ARE STILL HIGHER THAN THEY

02:41:56.207 --> 02:41:59.176 region:rollup2
WERE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

02:41:57.441 --> 02:42:00.811 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE RECESSION FAMILIES

02:41:59.176 --> 02:42:01.845 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T RECOVERED WHILE THE

02:42:00.811 --> 02:42:03.113 region:rollup2
STATE ECONOMY HOUSE.

02:42:01.845 --> 02:42:04.048 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT

02:42:03.113 --> 02:42:05.983 region:rollup2
WE RESTORE THE STATE'S

02:42:04.048 --> 02:42:07.551 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO THE

02:42:05.983 --> 02:42:08.619 region:rollup2
CHILD CARE FOOD PROGRAM BECAUSE

02:42:07.551 --> 02:42:09.887 region:rollup2
A CHILD CARE PROVIDERS DON'T

02:42:08.619 --> 02:42:11.121 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT PROGRAM THEY JUST PULL

02:42:09.887 --> 02:42:11.689 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE FUNDING

02:42:11.121 --> 02:42:13.324 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PULLING FROM THEIR

02:42:11.689 --> 02:42:14.158 region:rollup2
PROVIDER RATES. BECAUSE FOOD IS

02:42:13.324 --> 02:42:15.192 region:rollup2
AN OPTIONAL WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE

02:42:14.158 --> 02:42:16.327 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM THEY MAKE IT WORK

02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:17.661 region:rollup2
