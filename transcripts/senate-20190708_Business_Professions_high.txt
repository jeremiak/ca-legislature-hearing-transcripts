COUNCIL WE ARE IN THE STATUTE ALREADY THIS IS A VOLUNTARY OR A CERTIFICATION THAT WOULD. BE SOMETHING THAT ASH CAL ANIMALS WOULD ADMINISTER SO WILL NOT COST THE SEAT ANY MONEY BUT WE ARE HOPING TO HELP PROFESSIONALLY AS THE THE TRADE. AND SINCE THEY OFTENTIMES RESPOND ALONGSIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ISSUES LIKE AN ANIMAL FIGHTING RING OR HOARDING OR CODE ENFORCEMENT MATTERS SO WE THINK IT'S BEST FOR ALL OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FAMILY IF THEY'RE STANDARDIZED TRAINING. IS RECOGNIZED AND MONITORED IN SOME FASHION WITHOUT COSTING THE STATE ANY MONEY SO WE HAVE CREE I'VE IT TAKES A VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

THOSE THAT WORK WITH ANIMALS EVERY DAY AND ESPECIALLY THEIR APPREHENSION TREATMENT AND SO ON BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE UNIFORMS TRADING. SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS -- TO REACH THAT CERTIFICATION LEVEL WHICH WOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO JUST ANYONE.

AND ALSO TRY TO OFFER MORE TRAINING NIELSEN ANNUAL CONFERENCE FOR THERE'S LOTS OF TRAINING PROVIDED. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU ARE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK IN THIS AREA AND THE ANALYSIS A NUMBER OF FIVE OF ISSUES ARE RAISED THAT. THAT WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER AS YOU MOVE THE BILL FORWARD AND GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THOSE YOU'RE WELCOME TO ADDRESS THEM IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU WISH. I CONFESS I HAVE NOT THE ON PAGE [inaudible] SEVEN MY PREVIOUS. I THINK A ON THE ISSUE OF A SUNSET PART OF THIS PURPOSE IS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS. PURSUING THIS SORT OF TRAINING. WILL SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR CAREER AND BE RECOGNIZED AND VALUED BY THEIR LOCAL CITIES. SO I THINK YOU SUNSET SORT OF UNDERMINES INCENTIVE OF INDIVIDUALS TO TRAIN I'M I SO I I GUESS I HESITATE TO SAY. I AM ABSOLUTELY DOWN ON A SUNSET. BUT  A FEEL IN THIS SORT OF VERY YOU'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CARVE OUT TIME AND THEIR CALENDAR. TO GO TO THESE TRAINS TO PURSUE THE TRAINS. I WOULD WANT TO THINK THROUGH HOW SUNSET INTERACTS WITH THAT SORT OF MOTIVATION THAT A RECOMMENDATION YEAH I THINK THAT WE JUST ASK THAT YOU TAKE A TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND COMMON FEW OTHERS. REGARDING THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD -- YEAH I WOULD DISCUSS WITH THEM HOW THAT. MIGHT BE DONE -- I THINK THE STRENGTH OF CERTIFICATION DESERVE BE BROAD BASED AND REFLECT EXPERTISE FROM A VARIETY OF SECTORS [inaudible] SEOUL ON I WILL LAST I WILL WORK OF MY SPONSORS IN YOUR STAFF TO THINK ABOUT IS THERE A FOR THE CROSS SECTION THAT WE MIGHT SPECIFIED -- AND WE GO ON TO DAY IN HOUSES BECAUSE ANA IDENTIFY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND HOW THAT'S TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THINGS JUST. TO YES YEAH TAKE A LOOK AT THE HIS HIS UNIFORM YEAH I WILL I WILL INDEED IN ON THIS ISSUE IS SPECIFICALLY THE BOARD COMPOSITION THINK THAT'S A A GOOD ISSUE WE WANTED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF BROAD SKILL SET. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I WILL LOOK AT THOSE PERFECT PLACE FOR GREAT THANK YOU AND WE'LL HAVE A MOTION WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM SIR THAN YOU VERY MUCH. WHO IS THE? THIS KAMLAGER-DOVE OF I THINK IS HERE WELCOME ME AND THIS IS ITEM NUMBER. TWO ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FORTY ONE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. AS A NUMBER OF OTHER SENATE COMMITTEES MEETING AT THIS TIME SO WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A QUORUM BUT WILL BEGIN. HEARING YOUR BILL AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. WE WELCOME YOU [inaudible] NUMBER. I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL. TWO FOUR ONE AB TWO FOUR ONE WILL REDUCE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE BY MANDATING THAT CONTINUED EDUCATION COURSES REQUIRED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT BOARD AND BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. INCLUDE CURRICULUM ON IMPLICIT BIAS CURRICULUM SHALL INCLUDE EXAMPLES OF HOW IMPLICIT BIAS AFFECTS PERCEPTIONS AND TREATMENT AND OR STRATEGIES TO REDUCE UNINTENDED BUYS SEES IN DECISION MAKING. THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES. MY OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. I HAVE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND MADE SURE THAT THE BILL APPLIES ONLY TO COURSES THAT HAVE A DIRECT PATIENT CARE COMPONENT. INPATIENT CARE IMPLICIT BIAS PARTICULARLY CAN THREATEN THE LIVES OF PATIENTS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS CONSTANTLY ARE MAKING RAPID DECISIONS UNDER STRESSFUL CONDITIONS THAT MAY ALTER THE LIVES OF PATIENTS. IF WE SUB CONSCIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN LIVES ARE LESS VALUABLE THAN OTHERS THEN WE MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO TRY TO SAVE THOSE LIVES. FOR EXAMPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE FOLLOWING. BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH RELATED CAUSES THAN WHITE WOMEN. WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN TREATED BY A FEMALE PHYSICIAN. 18% OF PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANS OR CLEAR AVOID DOCTORS OFFICES FOR FEAR OF DISCRIMINATION AND PROVIDER BIAS. AND LATINO MEN IN CALIFORNIA OR BEST TREATMENT FOR HIGH RISK PROSTATE CANCER THAN WHITE MEN. WITH THE DISTRICTS PARTICULARLY DIRE THERE IS AN URGENCY AND FINDING A SOLUTION. CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL COMMUNITY SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT TO IMPROVE TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER SERVED BY THEIR HEALTH PROVIDERS. PASSED LEGISLATION INTEGRATING CULTURAL COMPETENCY CURRICULUM INTO CONTINUED MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR MEDICAL BOARD LICENSEES SHOWS US THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT IT'S BENEFICIAL. TO LICENSEES. AB TWO FOUR ONE TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTATIVE APPROACH TO REDUCE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS DOCTOR ACKERMAN ASSOCIATE CLINICAL PROFESSIONAL AND DOCTOR RICHARD HOOD PAST PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. VERY GOOD THE FIRST WITNESS. OKAY YOU COULD PRESS THE BUTTON AND THERE YOU GO IT'S WORKING IS THAT WORKING OKAY WELCOME. OF PLEASE NOTE THAT MY COMMENTS ARE MINE AND DO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE VIEWS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. EQUITABLE CARE IS IN DIRECT ALIGNMENT WITH THE PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES OF THE NURSING PROFESSION. APPEARS COMMITMENT TO SERVE OTHERS AS WHAT WE WOULD HAS MADE NURSING ONE OF THE MOST TRUSTED PROFESSIONS. AS A NURSE I AM HERE TO EMPHASIZE THAT AND HEALTH CARE WE ARE NOT LIVING UP TO HER PERFECT OUR POTENTIAL TO PROVIDING QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. HELP THEIR HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES ARE VERY WELL DOCUMENTED AND THE HEALTH CARE LITERATURE. THEIR PERNICIOUS AN ON GOING. UNCONSCIOUS BIAS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CAN LEAD TO HEALTH DISPARITIES SUCH AS IN ADEQUATE TREATMENT OF CONDITIONS LIKE PAIN. OBESITY CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ASTHMA AND MENTAL HEALTH. NOT ONLY DOES UNCONSCIOUS BIAS CONTRIBUTE TO UNDER TREATMENT BUT STDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PROVIDERS WITH MORE IMPLICIT BIASES ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH PATIENTS. THIS IMPACTS THE TRUST PATIENT TOP AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THE LIKELIHOOD. THAT PATIENTS WILL SEEK HEALTH CARE. THE PARADOX WITH UNCONSCIOUS BIAS IS THAT THE THINGS THAT DWELL IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS. ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR PERSONAL OR PROFESSIONAL VALUES THIS MEANS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A GROUP OF BAD PROVIDERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTH DISPARITIES. RATHER IT IS LIKELY THAT IT'S A COLLECTIVE ISSUE THAT INCLUDES CARING WELL INTENTIONED PROVIDERS WHO AT TIMES. ARE MAKING HEALTHCARE DECISIONS BASED ON BY US RATHER THAN STANDARDIZE CARE. THIS IS MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN WHEN PROVIDERS ARE TIRED ON CERTAIN OVER BURDENED OR HAD MULTIPLE DEMANDS ON THEIR ATTENTION. I'M CONSCIOUS BUYERS CAN BE MITIGATED WE PROPOSE THAT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FORTY ONE AND IS THE FIRST STEP IN ASSURING HEALTH. CARE EQUITY FOR ALL. HE VERY MUCH YOUR NECK NEXT WHEN THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR RODNEY HOOD I'M THE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND I ALSO SERVED ON THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE JOURNAL CALLED RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES. THESE UP FOCUS ON ELIMINATING HELP EQUITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. OF FOR DECADES PUBLISHED LITERATURE HAS DOCUMENT RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT CONSISTENTLY REVEAL MINORITY AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SUFFER THE WORST HEALTH OUTCOMES IN EVEN LESS LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. TWENTY YEARS AGO. THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE PUBLISHED ONE OF THE FIRST ARTICLES ON HEALTH INEQUITY. POINTING OUT THAT BLACK PATIENTS ESPECIALLY BLACK WOMEN WENT. WHEN TREAT IT MOSTLY BY WHITE PHYSICIANS RECEIVE LESS THAN THERAPEUTIC CARE? NOW AT THAT TIME THE AUTHORS OF THE ARTICLE WERE PUZZLED AS TO WHY THIS OCCURRED. BECAUSE THE PATIENTS WERE ARE ACTUALLY PAID ACTORS AND EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME THING EXCEPT FOR RACE. AND GENDER. HOWEVER WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE HEART THE IMPLICIT BIAS TESTS STUDIES BEGIN TO MEASURE THESE PARAMETERS WITHIN OF PHYSICIANS. IN A TWO THOUSAND AND NINE ANOTHER STUDY WAS PUBLISHED. LOOKING AT OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OF PHYSICIANS AND BASICALLY WHAT IT SHOWED WAS THAT THESE PHYSICIANS HAD A HIGH ANTI BLACK IMPLICIT BIAS. IN WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE THIS RESULT IN HE DECISION MAKING IT SHOW THAT THESE PHYSICIANS MADE MORE NEGATIVE DECISIONS FOR THE OF OUR BLACK PATIENTS RATHER THAN WHITES [inaudible] SO. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION. WILL PROVIDE IS BIASES INFLUENCED ERASURE DECISIONS. I BELIEVE IT IS CLEAR THAT PROVIDE A BIASES IMPLICIT OR OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTE TO MANY OF THE HEALTH INEQUITIES SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED ALREADY. AS A FIRST STEP TO RESOLVE THESE DISPARITIES INEFFECTIVE DIVERSITY A CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING MUST INCLUDE IMPLICIT BIAS EDUCATION AND TRAINING. I CURRENTLY SERVE AS CHAIR OF THE SAN DIEGO GANG COMMISSION FOR PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION. AND WORK CLOSELY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING HAS BEEN COOPERATING INTO THEIR TRAINING IN SAN DIEGO. BUT THE QUESTION IS DOES THIS WORK. NATIONAL DATA SHOWS IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT THE POSITIVE RESULTS CAN BE SHORTLY OF IT MUST BE SUSTAINED AND REINFORCE WITH REPETITIVE TRAINING. THIS SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE LIFE LONG LEARN SOCIALIZE STEREO TYPING TRIGGERS. THAT LEAD TO BIASES ARE REPEATEDLY IMPRINTED INTO A SUB CONSCIENCE. THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE IN CAN ONLY BE REMEDIED. WITH REPEATED ATTEMPTS AT RE SOCIALIZING UP FRONT. SO I BELIEVE A. B. TWO FORTY ONE WILL SERVE AS A NECESSARY FIRST STEP TO ADDRESSING CRUCIAL NEEDED. EDUCATION TRAINING OF OUR CURRENT FUTURE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN IN THE MOST DIVERSE STATE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU COULD JUST IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND YOUR SUPPORT POSITION THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC. MR TURN MEMBERS BUT THE ARMS ARE ON BEHALF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THE BOARD IS MADE A DECISION TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED HOWEVER I DO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE BORDER WHICH THE NURSING DOES SUPPORT IMPLICIT BIAS FOR ALL OF OUR LICENSEES WHICH A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THE ISSUE THAT THE BOARD HAS RECENTLY. FOUNDED IS UNRESOLVED IS THE INTENT ON HOW IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WE AVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE ARE PLEASED THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US. AND SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT OUR NEXT BOARD MEETING WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. TERRIFIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING AND SHARING YOUR TESTIMONY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I SEE NOW WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. CENTER PAN AND CENTER OUR CHILDREN. I THANK YOU AND WHAT THANK YOU SOME NUMBER UNLIKE ADULT FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- I MEAN THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS STUDIES LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF HEALTH DISPARITIES AND ACTUALLY DISPARITIES AND THE HEALTH CARE AND WELL -- AND CERTAINLY IMPLICIT. BIAS IS PART OF THIS AND SO -- I KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE MEDICAL EDUCATION WORLD WHERE I CAME FROM -- THERE CERTAINLY -- NOW THE GREATER AWARENESS BUT CERTAINLY MORE EDUCATION -- THERE AND OF COURSE WITH CMV WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE EDUCATE OUR CURRENT PRACTITIONERS IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING FOR THE STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS ARE COMING THROUGH BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTIVELY IN PRACTICE. AND AND ALSO RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS JUST MORE JUST MEDICINE AS WELL I MEAN IT'S WE NEED TO LOOK ACROSS THE HEALTH PROFESSION SO. ASSEMBLY AND THE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND WITH LIKE TO MOVE THE BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR PANTS AND ARCHULETA. THANK YOU SIMPLY ONE FROM BEING IN THIS THROUGH ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- I I AM SO PLEADED HONORED THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS I THINK THAT AS SO MANY MINORITIES WHO ARE NOW -- IN MEDICINE -- IN A PROFESSIONS AND SOMEONE IN IS ALMOST SHAMEFUL THAT WE HAVE TO PUT A BILL ON THE TABLE. TO GET PEOPLE TO REALIZE TAT EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS AND EQUAL TREATMENT ACROSS THE BOARD IS PART OF YOUR OVERALL PARTY YOUR PROFESSIONALISM. AND I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TO OPEN THAT DOOR TO EVEN MORE EQUALITY IN MEDICINE MORE EQUALITY WHEN PEOPLE ARE JUDGING ONE ANOTHER. AND LOOKING INTO THEIR EYES AND SAID YOU ARE WHAT I AM AND IN AS WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- OF MINORITIES IN PROFESSIONS THEN IT'LL START LOOKING LIKE AMERICA IT'LL START LOOKING -- LIKE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THIS IS GREAT I I AM TOTALLY -- I I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE HAD TO DO THIS BUT I SUPPORTED A 100% AND I THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD. YOU DO CERTAINLY HAVE MY BOAT VERY GOOD -- I TAKE A PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT ESTABLISH QUORUM SO THE SECRETARY WOULD CALL THE ROLL.

PIECE OF LEGISLATION THE ANALYSIS RAISES A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THEM HERE TERMS OF WHO'S INCLUDED IN ARE NOT AND AND THE ABILITY DID HAVE. TO CORRECT OVERSIGHT SO WE CAN MAKE SURE IT WORKS YES SO -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND MISTER CHAIR IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT I KNOW IN THE BE -- AMENDMENTS AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS A QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT -- INDIOS ARE INCLUDED AND IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE INCLUDED SINCE THEY ARE ALSO PART OF THE CODE THAT WAS REFERENCED BE PC SECTION. TWO FOUR FIVE THREE EIGHT SO -- WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK TO KIND OF CLARIFY THAT BUT IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD BE PART OF THAT -- THERE WERE SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS RELATED -- TO JUST THE AUDITING -- AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE DECIDED TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO GIVE -- THE BEER AND TIME TO TO GET UP IN -- IN MOVING IS ALSO OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY DO AUDITS EVERY FIVE YEARS AND THEIR AUDITING ONE FIFTH OF THE PROVIDER POPULATION SO WITH ROLLING -- AND THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE BOARD TO COME UP WITH REGULATIONS FIRST AND THEN AFTER THAT THE NEXT STEP IS WORKING TO INTEGRATE WITH THE PROVIDER SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THERE'S ENOUGH. SPACE IN BETWEEN THE TIME THAT THIS IS SIGNED IN ONE IMPLEMENTATION WOULD HAPPEN TO ALLOW FOR A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO HOW IT WOULD BE DONE. VERY GOOD -- THANK YOU AND I GUESS -- I'D COURAGE TO WORK WITH OUR STAFF ON THE ON THE WHO'S INCLUDED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FOR CLARIFYING THE MEASURE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY 2% EIGHTY THREE EIGHT SEVEN WHICH WILL CREATE A TASK FORCE TO PROVE. PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABELING AND REDUCE ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS. ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS ARE SERIOUS CHALLENGE THE ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND COST THE U. S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FIT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF SUCH EVENTS IS CONFUSING PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABELING. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT UP 225% OF MEDICATION ERRORS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO NAME CONFUSION AND CONFUSION. FOR SOME PATIENTS ESPECIALLY SENIORS THERE CAN BE SEVERE AND POTENTIALLY FATAL CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING O DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO MEDICATIONS THAT LOOK OR SOUND ALIKE. OUR PRIVATION OF THIS BILL WHICH PASSED THE ASSEMBLY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SUCH ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY ENCOURAGING PHYSICIANS. HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEIR PATIENTS ABOUT INCLUDING THE PURPOSE OF A MEDICATION ON ITS LABEL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT INCLUDING SUCH INFORMATION WOULD BE AN EASY AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY. TO AVOID CONFUSION REDUCE ERRORS AND IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY. HOWEVER AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM A MORE ROBUST PROCESS. THAT WILL ALLOW EXPERTS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO DEVELOP A BROADER POLICY ON THIS ISSUE. EIGHTY THREE EIGHT SEVEN WILL BRING TOGETHER DIVERSE GROUP OF EXPERTS TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES TO PROVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABELING AND REDUCE ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS. WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ASSISTANCE IN DRAFTING THE AMENDMENTS TO CREATE A TASK FORCE IN A PROCESS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THE TASK FORCE WILL PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL IMPROVE LABELING IN A MATTER THAT PROTECTS PATIENT SAFETY SAVE LIVES AND REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS.

TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN TEARS WERE CONTINUE ON THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS INTO THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH SUCH TERRORISTS HAVE SINCE BEEN INDEFINITELY SUSPENDED THE AMBIGUITY REGARDING THEIR ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE A CAUSE FOR CONCERN FOR THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING. OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES FREE TRADE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA MEXICO HAS PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN BUILDING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY ECONOMY TO BECOMING THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD. TERRACE BASED ON MEXICO WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO BOTH THE CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET AND THE ECONOMY.
