FOR THAT FOR SPARKING THE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT. BUT YOU'RE ACTIVISM IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY PRE DATES THAT DAY. SHE JOINED THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE NAACP. IN NINETEEN FOURTY THREE. TWELVE YEARS BEFORE THAT FATEFUL COMMUTE. SOME LESSER KNOWN FACTS. ABOUT ROSA PARKS. IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. IN HER FIRST YEARS IN THE ORGANIZATION SHE WORKS SPECIFICALLY ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES. IN ALABAMA COMMUNITIES. ROSA PARKS WAS HONORED AS THE MOTHER OF THE MODERN DAY CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT BECAUSE HER DELIBERATE ACTS OF DEFIANCE BEGAN A MOVEMENT THAT ENDED LEGAL SEGREGATION. IN OUR COUNTRY AND MADE HER AN INSPIRATION TO FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WELL WE HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY GRAPPLE WITH ISSUES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. IS IS. LOOK AT IT NATIONWIDE. MANY DO NOT KNOW THAT ROSA PARKS WHILE WORKING FOR THE NAACP WAS A KEY FIGURE IN EFFORTS TO PROTECT. AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. SHE ALSO FOUGHT TO PROTECT AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN FROM FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND LYNCHINGS. SURE WORK TO ENSURE THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED COULD SEEK JUSTICE. THE END DOUBLE ACP APPOINTED HER TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSAULT OF RE SEE TAYLOR. ON SUNDAY SEPTEMBER THIRD NINETEEN FORTY FOUR. TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD RE SEE TAYLOR WAS WALKING HOME FROM CHURCH WITH HER FRIEND FANNIE DANIEL. SHE WAS KIDNAPPED AND RAPED BY A GROUP OF WHITE MEN. WHEN THE NEWS REACHED MONTGOMERY OFFICES OF THE N.

ROSA PARKS IN RECENT TAYLOR FOUGHT TO HOLD THE PERPETRATORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. ACCOUNTABLE SOME SIXTY YEARS BEFORE OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. ROSA PARKS LIVE THE LIFE THAT WAS LONG AND INSPIRATIONAL WELL BEYOND OF THE SINGLE ACT OVER HUSING TO GIVE UP HER SEAT. TO A SYSTEM UP AND OF INJUSTICE AND OPPRESSION.

THANK HIM ISRAEL'S. STIR BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES AS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY THREE AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. TO THIS DAY ROSA PARKS LEGACY. SERVES AS AN INSURANCE SYMBOL OF LOVE. AND OF JUSTICE. WHEN SHE REMAINED IN HER SEAT ON THAT BUS IN MONTGOMERY ON DECEMBER FIRST NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE HER ACTION. BECAME A CATALYST FOR CHANGE. A SINGLE PEBBLE. IN THE WATER WHOSE RIPPLE TURNED INTO A WAVE OF CHANGE AND ACTIVISM FOR MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND BLACK. MEGAMI RESIDENTS WHO FOLLOWED HER LEADERSHIP AND BOYCOTTED THE BUSES IN MONTGOMERY UNTIL THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES RULED. THAT MONTGOMERY'S SEGREGATION LAWS WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THIS WITH EITHER THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF MRS PARKS ACTIVISM. HER LIFE WAS DEDICATED TO STANDING HER GROUND AND SPEAKING UP. FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. SHE WAS A LIFELONG ACTIVIST AND FAMOUSLY SAID THE ONLY TIRED I WAS. WAS TIRED OF GIVING IN. THESE WORDS STILL RESONATE AND CONTINUE. TO INSPIRE US TODAY WE MUST RECOGNIZE THE INEQUITIES THAT CONTINUE TO EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY. AND BE RELENTLESS IN PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES. AND PROVIDING ALL PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE THEIR DREAMS AND ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. AGAIN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD SO THAT WE MAY REFLECT ON THE LEGACY OF ROSA PARKS AND HONOR HER ON WHAT WOULD BE. HER HUNDRED FIFTH BIRTHDAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE VOTE COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU MISTER BONTA DOCTOR WHETHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE BLACK CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY THREE WHICH HONORS A HUNDRED FIFTH BIRTHDAY OF ROSA PARKS. AND URGES ALL CALIFORNIANS TO REMEMBER THIS GREAT AMERICAN WOMAN. THIS YOUR BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY IS RATHER UNIQUE AND VIBRANT. AND IT IS ONLY APPROPRIATE THAT WE BEGIN BLACK HISTORY MONTH WITH THE CELEBRATION OF ONE OF ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT ICONS ROSA PARKS. THERE'S VERY LITTLE I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE PARTS THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW. BECAUSE A STORY IS TOLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF TREMENDOUS COURAGE AND STRENGTH. WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE REALLY WASN'T PHYSICALLY TIRED ANY MORE THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE. SHE WAS JUST TIRED OF BEING TREATED THE WAY SHE WAS TREATED IN THIS COUNTRY. SHE WAS SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND TIRED. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT SHE MODE IT MOTIVATED HER TO ONCE AGAIN STAND AND TO STAND FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS JUST. BUT WHAT I TEACH HISTORY TO MY STUDENTS I TRY TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND MORE THAN JUST THE FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT THEY SEE. BUT HOPEFULLY THE GOING FROM ITS SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOULD MOTIVATE THEM TO BE A PART OF HISTORY THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE HISTORY IN THEIR LIVES. YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF ROSA PARKS. I OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF ONE PERSON. THE POWER OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO BRING CHANGE IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE FACED WITH. AND ONE LITTLE AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF CHALLENGE THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. TO OVERTURN SLAVERY. THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AGAINST THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN THE WORLD. AND TO BE JUST SMALL INDIVIDUALS WHO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT POWERFUL THEY DON'T COME FROM POWERFUL COUNTRIES THAT CAN COME IN AND DEFEND THEIR IDENTITY AND WHO THEY ARE. AND YET THAT INTERNAL. AND AN INTERNAL PERSEVERANCE IS WHAT DRIVES IN EACH AND EVERY DAY. TO BE A PART OF THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND TO DEMAND THAT THEY BE RESPECTED. YOU KNOW I THINK OF ROSA PARKS SHE IS NOT THE FIRST TO SET ON THE BUS AND OFTENTIMES YOU HEAR HISTORIANS TALK ABOUT ALL THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THAT SYSTEM. THOSE WHO REFUSED TO GET UP ON THE BUS ALSO REFUSED TO MOVE AND THEY WERE PULLED OFF THE BUS BEATEN DRAG SOMETIMES LYNCHED AS EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO. AND YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND YOU SAY TO SELL ALL. SO SHE WASN'T THE FIRST NO SHE WASN'T BUT THEY'RE STILL COURAGE IN IT BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT. IF YOU HAD SEEN WHAT THE RESULTS OF YOUR ACTIONS WOULD BE. YOU'D BE LESS LIKELY WILLING TO TAKE THOSE ACTIONS. IT WASN'T THAT SHE DID KNOW THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE ARRESTED SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER SHE KNEW WHAT IT HAPPEN TO OTHERS. AND YET DESPITE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS HER TIME. SHE DECIDED TO DO THAT ANYWAY. AND THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE COURAGEOUS. BECAUSE SHE KNEW WHAT THE END RESULT WAS GOING TO BE. AND I SAY THAT TO YOU BECAUSE AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE TODAY. AND YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT FOLKS TELL US WHY YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. THE SAME THING HAPPENED HAPPENED LAST TIME THEY'LL TAKE YOU OFF THE BOOKS ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU A TICKET AND IN NOT GOING TO GET ANY FURTHER AND WAS STILL GOING TO BE IN THE SAME CONDITION. SO WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS. AND WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THAT REALITY AS WE TALK ABOUT CHANGE AND PROGRESS AND PROGRESS OF THINGS IN THIS HOUSE. SO THEY'RE GONNA DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER. AND WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO PERSIST. AND YET ROSA PARKS STOOD UP BECAUSE IT WAS HER TIME AND HER AND HER PERSISTENCE THAT EVENTUALLY BECAME THE ONE DROP OF WATER THAT CREATED THE FLOOD. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE SAY DOCTOR WEBER WHEN WILL YOU GIVE UP. WILL YOU GIVE IN ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS NATION. WHEN WILL YOU START TALKING ABOUT THAT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT STOP TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHEN WILL YOU DO THAT. AND I HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT I AM THE DAUGHTER OF THE ROSA PARKS OF THE WORLD. I AM THE PERSISTENT KNOCK AT THE DOOR FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. AND YOU SHOULD BE THE ROSA PARKS OF THE WORLD TO. BECAUSE A VISIT RIGHT IF IT IS JUST IT IS OUR TIME TO CONTINUE TO NOT THAT THE DOORS OF INEQUALITY. AND IT IS OUR TIME TO DEMAND JUSTICE AND FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE. SO I MIX EXCITED ALWAYS WHEN I TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE ROSA PARKS. BECAUSE THIS IS A SMALL WOMAN DOING A GREAT THING. AND WE LOOK BACK ON IT NOW AND THINK ABOUT WHAT SHE REALLY THAT COURAGEOUS YES SHE WAS. BECAUSE SHE WAS FIGHTING THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN THE WORLD. AND THEY COULD HAVE CRUSHED HER AND WE MAY WOULD HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HER AGAIN. SIGH I ASKED YOU TO BE THE ROSA PARKS OF THIS HOUSE. TO STAND FOR JUSTICE A STAND FOR EQUALITY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEARD BECAUSE IT IS TRULY OUR TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER DOCTOR EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM. I ALSO STAND ON BEHALF THE LGBT CAUCUS AS WE TALK ABOUT ROSA PARKS TODAY. AND ALSO AS A AS LIKE DOCTOR WEBER I'M ALSO AN EDUCATOR AND ONE I WOULD STAND IN FRONT OF MY STUDENTS AND TALK ABOUT SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE I WANT TO KNOW ALSO ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THEIR LIFE. I WANNA KNOW WHO THEY ARE AS THAT FULL PERSON. SOCIAL WORKERS YOU TO WORK WITH PEOPLE IN THE FULL CONTEXT OF THEIR LIFE. STILL WHEN I THINK ABOUT ROSA PARKS I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS TIED DEEPLY TO HER FAITH WHO FELT WHO FOUND FAITH IN THE A IN THE CHURCH. AND BEGAN ORGANIZING THEIR. I THINK ABOUT THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL A LITTLE BIT EARLY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO CARE FOR HER MOTHER AND HER GRANDMOTHER DURING TIMES OF ILLNESS. AND THEN I THINK ABOUT HER HAVING A JOB AND GOING AND WORKING WITH AND DOUBLE ACP AND ON THAT DAY ON THAT BUS. SHE SAT BEHIND THE LINE. SHE SAT BEHIND THE LINE THAT SAID BLACKS ONLY. BUT WHEN MORE PEOPLE GOT ON THE BUS MEMBERS THEY MOVED THE LINE. THEY MOVE THE LINE BEFORE HER AND HOW MANY OF US HAVE BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE THINK WE'VE ACHIEVED WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. AND SOMEBODY MOVES THE LINE. AND AT SOME POINT YOU SAY NO. I WILL NOT CONTINUE TO TAKE THE BACKSEAT WHEN THE LINE IS MOVED AFTER I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING APPROPRIATE. AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT. WHAT WE WERE WE CELEBRATE HER TODAY BUT AT THAT TIME BECAUSE SHE WAS A WOMAN? HER VOICE WASN'T REALLY HEARD. WHEN A STANDING OVATION WAS CREATED WHEN SHE WALKED INTO A ROOM AFTER IN SHE SAID SHOULD I SPEAK. AND THE MEN WHO WORK AT WHO WERE WONDERFUL ACTIVISTS SAID YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH. AND SO AFTER THAT SHE WAS FIRED FROM HER JOB. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT SHE WAS FIRED FROM HER JOB WE KNOW PEOPLE NOW WHO SPEAK OUT AND FACED SEVERE RETALIATION. AND NEVERTHELESS SHE PERSISTED. HER HUSBAND WAS GIVEN DEATH THREATS. SO EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS AN ICON OF THE SOUTH IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. SHE HAD MOVED NORTH LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHERE THERE WAS MORE OPPORTUNITY. WHEN SHE RETURNED TO SCHOOL AT THAT TIME. DEVELOPED A BIGGER EDUCATION. AND THEN AT THAT TIME WENT TO WORK FOR AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. REACH BACK TO THE SOUTH. A BUILDER A NETWORK IN IN DETROIT. AT THAT TIME BEING THE FIRST AT JOHN CONNORS FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN ELECTED TO CONGRESS. AND SHE WAS ITS FIRST SECRETARY EVEN THOUGH HE HAD OPINIONS THAT SAID WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE IN THE WORKPLACE. BUT HE KNEW SHE WAS THE BEST SECRETARY AROUND IS THAT HE MADE THAT EXCEPTION. PERSISTED SHE MAY CHANGE SHOULDN'T STOP. SHE HAD LEAVE AGAIN. TO CARE FOR HER MOTHER. AND HER HUSBAND. AS A LOT OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BECOME CARETAKERS CAREGIVERS. BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AROUND WHO'S GOING TO CARE FOR OUR SENIORS WHO'S GOING TO CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES. IT WAS ALSO PEOPLE LIKE ROSA PARKS LIVING EVERYDAY LIVES DOING THE RIGHT THING EVERY SINGLE DAY. AFTER SHE WAS A SENIOR SHE WAS LIVING ALONE THEIR OWN HOME. AND LIKE A WOMAN IN THE OWN SOUTHSIDE STOCK IN A JUST OCCURRED IN MY DISTRICT. SHE WAS ASSAULTED. BY A YOUNG PERSON. PULLING HER INTO THINKING HE WAS TRYING TO HELP. SHE WAS ASSAULTED WHEN SHE WAS IN HER LATE SEVENTIES LIVING ALONE INDEPENDENTLY IN DETROIT AND AT THAT TIME THEN WAS MOVED INTO INTO A DIFFERENT KIND OF HOUSING. SO WHILE SHE DID THIS ONE GREAT THING THAT WE ALL REMEMBER. LET US NEVER FORGET THE FULL LIFE SHE LIVED THAT IS SYMBOLIC OF THE STRUGGLES WE STILL FACE IF YOU ARE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. IF YOU'RE A WOMAN. ALL OF THESE THINGS AND THEN BECOMING A SENIOR ALSO PUT YOU IN ANOTHER VULNERABLE SITUATION. SO AS WE CONTINUE TO STAND FOR ROSA PARKS ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT SHE DID LET US NEVER FORGET THAT THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. ON ALL KINDS OF LEVELS THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR US ALL TO BE GREAT. IF ONLY WERE WILLING TO SERVE AND TO LIVE OUR LIVES OF QUIET DIGNITY EVERY SINGLE DAY. ON BEHALF OF THE LGBT CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. DOCTOR EGGMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR LEVIN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS I RISE. SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY THREE ROSA PARKS. IS A SYMBOL OF JUSTICE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE FOR STRENGTH AND COMMITMENT TO FIGHT. FOR EQUALITY. HER REFUSAL TO MOVE TO THE BACK OF THE BUS. WAS HEROIC. MEMBERS THERE IS DANGER IN THE AIR AT THIS MOMENT. THE INSIDIOUS IDEA. THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE LESS EQUAL THAN OTHERS. HAS REARED ITS UGLY HEAD IN OUR COUNTRY. WE MUST KEEP ROSA PARKS MEMORY ALIVE. WE MUST NOT RETURN THE PAST. AMERICA'S GREATNESS IS IN THE FUTURE THAT ROSA PARKS. FOR. I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD AND AYE ASPIRIN AYE THOSE. THANK YOU MISTER IRVING ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

I'M PROUD TO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LATINO CAUCUS TODAY. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY THREE. IT IS AN HONOR FOR US TO CELEBRATE. THE BIRTHDAY AND THE LEGACY OF A GREAT AMERICAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS HERO ROSA PARKS. AS MANY OF YOU HAVE OUTLINED. SHE IS MOST FAMOUS FOR HER PROTESTS. ON A BUS IN MONTGOMERY. WHERE SHE PAID HER FARE? WHERE SHE SAT IN THE SO CALLED SECTION WHERE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO SIT? AND BECAUSE OTHER PASSENGERS WHITE PASSENGERS WERE. MADE THE STAND. THE DRIVER TOLD HER AND OTHER AFTER AMERICAN PASSENGERS. YOU MUST GET UP. AND MOVE TO ACCOMMODATE OTHERS. SHE INDEED DEDICATED HER ENTIRE LIFE. TO A FIGHT FOR JUSTICE. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? WHEN. CALLED IN THAT SITUATION. WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU FACE. ARREST. AND LITERALLY DEATH THREATS AS ROSA PARKS DID FOR MANY MANY YEARS. IN THE FACE OF IT ALL. AND IN THE FACE OF DISCRIMINATION. SHE URGED THE DETERMINATION TO NEVER ACCEPTED. EVEN IF IT MUST BE INDOOR. IN HER OWN WORDS ROSA PARKS WAS ON A SEARCH FOR AWAY WORKING FOR FREEDOM AND FIRST CLASS CITIZENSHIP. BECAUSE NO INTELLIGENT RIGHT THINKING PERSON IS SATISFIED WITH LESS THAN HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE ENJOYED BY ALL PEOPLE. HOW FITTING THEN THEIR WE CELEBRATE HER LEGACY AT A TIME WHERE MANY OF US ARE FACING TREATMENT? THAT EQUATES A SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP. WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR DHAKA IN DREAMER FAMILY MEMBERS. THE POOR. THE HOMELESS. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO ARE STILL FACING DISCRIMINATION.

HR SEVENTY FOUR PROCLAIMS JANUARY TWENTY NINTH THROUGH FEBRUARY FOURTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAS CALIFORNIA GIRLS AND WOMEN IN SPORTS WEEK. THIS RESOLUTION SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF EQUALITY INCLUSION AND FEMALE EMPOWERMENT. RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF GIRLS AND WOMEN IN PROFESSIONAL COLLEGIATE. CLUB HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH AND RECREATIONAL SPORTS IS CRITICAL TO BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS WE FACE WITH IN THE SPORTING ARENA AND TO WHAT FOLLOWS US OUTSIDE IN OUR DAILY LIVES. REFLECTING UPON MY PARTICIPATION IN SPORTS AS A YOUNG GIRL. AYE REQUIRED SO MANY LIFE SKILLS FROM LEARNING. TEAMWORK GOAL SETTING DEDICATION TIME MANAGEMENT PERSEVERANCE AND RESILIENCE. AS WITH ANY THEME THERE'S ALWAYS CHALLENGES SUCH AS TOUGH LOSSES AN INCREDIBLE SACRIFICES THAT NEED TO BE MADE. BUT SPORTS PROVIDE US WITH THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM THESE CHALLENGES. AND WORK TOGETHER WITH YOUR TEAMMATES AND BETTER AND BECOME BETTER BECAUSE OF THAT. HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY SPORTS AS A YOUNG GIRL. HAS LED. TOO MANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND HAS BEEN A POSITIVE IMPACT IN MY LIFE. AND SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERY YOUNG GIRL OUT THERE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THEIR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES. TO THE GIRLS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY INTO THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS RESOLUTION IS FOR YOU. TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR COURAGE TO COMPETE IMPOSTOR THAT COMPETITIVE SPIRIT WE ALL KNOW IS NECESSARY TO WIN LIKE A GIRL. PLEASE JOIN ME TODAY IN CELEBRATING CALIFORNIA GIRLS AND WOMEN IN SPORTS WEEK I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE ROLE BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS. FAMOUS CERVANTES MS AG OCCURRING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND JOINT AUTHORED THIS RESOLUTION. PARTICIPATION IN SPORTS IS INCREDIBLE WAY TO LEARN. LIVE SUCH SKILL OF TEAMWORK. LEADERSHIP AND CONFIDENCE. WE SHOULD ALL BE ENCOURAGING GIRLS AND WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE AND TO COMPETE IN THE SPORT PLAYING SPORTS AT ALL LEVELS AT ALL LEVELS THEY'RE VERY POSITIVE VOICE TO. BRING OUT AND ENCOURAGING YOUNG GIRLS TO GET OUT OF THERE FOR A REGULAR FRAMEWORK. I AM I AM A MOTHER OF TWO DAUGHTERS AND I WANT TO TELL YOU I SPENT YEARS ON OF LEECHERS IN THE BLEACHERS WATCHING MY GIRLS PLAY. MY DAUGHTER MEGAN. IS AN INCREDIBLE ATHLETE. SHE ALWAYS COMPETED ON THE BOYS TEAM IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES PEOPLE LOOKED DOWN AT HER AND LOOKED DOWN AT ME FOR LETTING MY DAUGHTER PLAY ON THE BOYS TEAM. THERE WAS A GIRLS TEAM SHE'S VERY COMPETITIVE THE START THE TEAM. IT'S YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF RESILIENCE AS SHE WENT THROUGH ALL THE SPORTS ALWAYS COMPETING WITH THE BOYS. AND I WAS HAVING TO WEAR BOY'S UNIFORM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T MAKE GIRLS UNIFORMS. MY DAUGHTER TODAY I'M PROUD THE SHOES IN INDIANAPOLIS. INDIANA THIS MORNING SHE IS PRESENTING TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE A DS CORPORATION SHE DOES WOMEN'S MARKETING AND ACTIVATION FOR THEIR UNIFORMS. SO. I JUST WANT TO HONOR HER AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER YOUNG WOMEN THAT HAVE WORKED HARD IT'S BEEN A TOUGH TIME BECAUSE A. BUTTER I'M I THINK MANY OF US MIGHT REMEMBER WE DID NOISE OF THE BEST UNIFORMS AS THE WOMEN PLAYING ON THE SPORT RIGHT WE HAD THESE THINGS CALL PIN. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. I RESPECTFULLY ACTS ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. TAKING HIS IDEA CURRY SUMMER BAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND THANK YOU TO MEMBERS ARE CORONA WINTERS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AYE. AND PLEASE TO AUTHOR AND I THINK THEY'RE BOTH TERRIFIC AUTHORS OF THIS RESOLUTION NOT ONLY FOR BEING A CHEERLEADER ON THE SIDELINES FOR HER DAUGHTER'S MEMBER FROM WINTERS. BUT THAT MEMBER FROM CRYING HIS GREAT ATHLETIC EXPERIENCES WELL I THINK IT IS. WE WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO POINT SOMETHING OUT ABOUT WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SPORTS. AND THAT IS THE GROSS PAY DISPARITY. THAT WOMEN IN SPORTS EXPERIENCE. AND TOMORROW I THINK IS GROUNDHOG DAY SO I'M GONNA TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST REMIND US ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE SHOULD JUST SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON IT. EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE. AND ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES IS THE WOMEN'S TEAM IN SOCCER. WHICH ONE THAT TWENTY FIFTEEN WORLD CUP. AND AS YOU MAY KNOW. A THEY HAD TO SPLIT AMONG THEMSELVES TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR WINNING THE MOST WATCHED SPORTS GAME IN HISTORY IN THE WORLD. THE MEN MADE NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR LOSING AND ROUND SIXTEEN. THE WOMEN PLAY MORE EXHIBITION GAMES THEY'RE ONLY PAID IF THEY'D LOSE IF THEY WIN THE GAMES THE MEN PLAY FEWER EXHIBITION GAMES THEY ARE PAID IF THEY LOSE. AND THEY'RE PAID ALMOST HALF OF WHAT WOMEN GET IF THEY WHEN THEY GET PAID FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WOMEN GET THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ONLY IF THEY WIN AN EXHIBITION GAME. AND ON TOP OF THAT. THEY'VE WOMEN'S SOCCER PRODUCES MORE REVENUE THEY HAVE SOARED PAST THE MEN'S SOCCER LEAGUE FOR THE SOCCER LEAGUE THEN THEN THE MEN'S TEAM DOES I WANT THE MEN TO DO WELL BUT. THE WOMEN ARE REALLY TAKING OFF THEY ARE CHAMPIONS ACROSS THE WORLD THEIR RECORD IS THAT THEY HAVE WON MEDALS IN EVERY OLYMPICS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX. AND THEY MAKE LESS THAN THE MEN. AND THEY GET LOWER TRAVELING ALLOWANCES. LESS EXPENSIVE OR LESS A FOR SPONSORSHIP APPEARANCES THEY GET LOWER WORLD CUP BONUSES LOWER BONUSES FOR WINNING THEIR OTHER EXHIBITION GAMES. AND. IT'S NOT JUST SOCCER BY THE WAY WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING THE GENDER WAGE GAP IS GROWING IT'S NOT GETTING BETTER IT'S GROWING IN PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL. AND PRIZE MONEY IN PROFESSIONAL GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS IS LOWER FOR WOMEN. AND WOMEN ARE SHORT CHANGED EVEN AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. THE NCAA AWARDS A TOTAL OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR MEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT VICTORIES IT AWARDS NOTHING FOR WOMEN. AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WOMEN ARE WINNING MORE GAMES THEY'RE PLAYING MORE GAMES THEY'RE EARNING MORE FOR THEIR SPORTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THEY'RE PAID LESS TO WIN. THAN MEN WHEN THEY LOSE. THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON IT EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE. BEEN IN THIS IS MESSED UP. AND WE OWE IT TO THE WOMEN ATHLETES OF THE PAST THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE TO SHINE THAT SPOTLIGHT IN THE CALLING OUT EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE CAN I THINK THE MEMBER FOR CORONA AND THE MEMBER FROM WINTERS. FOR GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT I ENCOURAGE JUST TO BE SURE TO. POINT THIS OUT EVERY CHANCE WE GET AND CONSIDER WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BE FIGHTING FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN SPORTS FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS THINK YOU.
