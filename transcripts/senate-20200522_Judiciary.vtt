THANK YOU. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:03.112
CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT NOT

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:06.015
JUST THIS BILL. NINE FIFTEEN

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.217
BUT OTHERS THAT ARE IN THE

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:11.420
PIPELINE IS THAT. WE ARE

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.756
LOOKING AT SOLVING HALF THE

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:17.660
PROBLEM. AT THE RENTAL LEVEL

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:19.095
WHETHER IT BE COMMERCIAL OR

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.364
WHETHER IT BEING ALL WITH

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.865
MOBILE HOMES OR RENTERS OF

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:26.469
APARTMENTS. IF WE MAKE ALL

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.639
THESE ARE IF WE IMPLEMENT ALL

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.207
THESE PROTECTIONS FOR THE

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.876
RANCHERS AND I THINK UNDER

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:34.911
THESE VERY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:37.647
OF HOW BIG NINETEEN ARE THERE

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:38.848
ARE STRONG ARGUMENTS THAT

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:41.918
PEOPLE NEED SUPPORT. IT ONLY

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:45.922
RESOLVES HALF THE ISSUE AND I

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.223
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE EQUAL

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.393
CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO BUDGET

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:52.795
APPROPRIATIONS WHETHER IT BE AT

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.630
THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:57.833
LEAST AT THE STATE WITHIN OUR-

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.636
IS THAT WE CREATE. FUNDING

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:03.406
MECHANISMS THAT WE'RE HELP OUT

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:06.976
THE PARK OWNERS WERE THE OWNERS

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:10.479
OF THE- THE LAND WHAT WERE THE

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:14.016
OTHER COMPLEX- BECAUSE IT SEEMS

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:17.520
FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO ME. TO

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.855
OFFER ALL THESE PROTECTIONS

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:22.191
OVER HERE. WHILE IGNORING THE

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:26.762
SIMILAR ON NEEDS OVER THERE ARE.

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:29.532
I WOULD ASK THAT AS THIS MOVES

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:32.201
FORWARD IS THERE ANY COMPATIBLE

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:35.271
OR OR ACCOMPANYING LEGISLATION

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.340
WITH THIS ARE COMING THROUGH

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:39.675
THE PIPELINE EITHER BY THE

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.777
ALTAR OR OTHERS THAT WOULD

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.946
ALLOW FOR FUNDING MECHANISM THE

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:46.816
STATE TO HELP THE OWNERS ARE

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:49.085
WHERE THE LANDLORDS BECAUSE THE

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:50.219
PARK OWNER STILL HAPPEN

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:53.923
MORTGAGE TO START PART. AND I

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.958
WOULD ASK THAT IF ANY OF THIS

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:57.226
WERE TO MOVE FORWARD THAT IT BE

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:59.895
DONE WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.197
PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED AS WELL

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.999
BECAUSE LOOKING AT ONLY THE

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:07.036
RANGERS ARE ONLY GETS A SO FAR.

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:09.138
THE OTHER IS. THE TWO POINTS

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.173
RAISED EARLIER BY THE

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.542
REPRESENTED AS IS THAT BEING

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:18.347
UTILITIES BEING BORN- BUYING AT

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:21.751
THE OWNERS AND ALL SO ARE BEING

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:23.986
HELD LIABLE FOR ANY IT CODE

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:27.123
VIOLATIONS- SO I WOULD ASK THE

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:29.992
AUTHOR. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.060
INCORPORATE INTO THIS

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.528
LEGISLATION THROUGH A FRIENDLY

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.364

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:41.470
PROTECT ARE THE PROPERTY ON THE

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:44.140
CART OWNER. IN SUCH A WAY THAT

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:47.943
UTILITIES CONTINUE TO BE THE

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.246
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RENTER.

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:52.615
AND WITH YOUR BE A LIABILITY

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.617
WAIVER PROVISION THAT WOULD

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:57.620
ALSO ALLOW FOR THEM TO RECEIVE

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.555
SOME DEGREE OF PROTECTION I

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:00.790

BEFORE WE DO THAT I MENTIONED

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:16.038
IF THE LENDERS WOULD ALSO STEP

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:19.075

APPROACH I WAS THE RATIONALE.

02:04:20.953 --> 02:04:22.955
SO I GUESS WITH THE AS I

02:04:23.022 --> 02:04:25.324

TO BE BROAD. BECAUSE WE WANT TO

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.717
HAVE STABILITY SO THAT WE DON'T

02:04:51.784 --> 02:04:53.452
HAVE THESE OBJECTIONS AND THEN

INTERVENTION IT'S SIMPLY A

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.904
DELAY IN PAYING THE BUT THE

02:05:41.233 --> 02:05:43.669
BLADE BETTER EXCELLENCE BEFORE

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:44.970
ONE AGAIN FROM WHOEVER WROTE TO

02:05:45.037 --> 02:05:46.605
STAFF REPORT AND IN SPEND

02:05:46.672 --> 02:05:48.340
TEACHES US THAT THE STATE CAN

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:50.943
IMPAIR ONTRACTS BUT THEY HAVE

02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:51.610
TO BE REASONABLE AND

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:54.046
APPROPRIATE. FIFTY RESULT IF

02:05:54.113 --> 02:05:56.448
EVERYBODY'S COLLUDED IN IN THE

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:59.785
CATCH WORSE THAT. WHERE IS THAT

02:05:59.852 --> 02:06:01.353
LIMITATION ON THE IMPAIRMENT OF

02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:02.721
CONTRACTS BECAUSE I AGAIN I'M

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:04.390
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IS

02:06:04.456 --> 02:06:06.158
THE BUSINESS THAT HASN'T HAD

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:08.460
15% OF THEIR SPACE. LIMITED BY

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:10.996
PUBLIC HEALTH WATER. SO AND WE

02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:12.665
AND AGAIN THAT'S THE REASON FOR

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:14.733
THE- FOR THE DISTINCTION

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:16.969
SECTION TO. THIS LIMITED TO THE

02:06:17.036 --> 02:06:18.404
HOSPITALITY AND IS A MORE

02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:19.972
AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION WITH

02:06:20.039 --> 02:06:20.472
THE POTENTIAL FOR LEASE

02:06:20.539 --> 02:06:22.841
TERMINATION. WE TOOK A HIGH

02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:23.809
SENATE FOR THE ADDICTION

02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:26.078
MORATORIUM BECAUSE IT IS A LESS

02:06:26.145 --> 02:06:28.180
AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION- I

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:29.348
THINK IT WOULD BE A MUCH WEAKER

02:06:29.415 --> 02:06:31.350
CASE FOR IMPAIRMENT CONTRACT.

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:33.285
AND WE HAVE ALL ACROSS THE

02:06:33.352 --> 02:06:34.954
STATE. WE HAVE EXISTING

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:36.588
COMMERCIAL MORATORIUM. NORTH

02:06:36.655 --> 02:06:38.824
KOREA IN OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO'S

02:06:38.891 --> 02:06:40.859
FOR THAT DO NOT REQUIRE ANY

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:42.528
DROP IN BUSINESS THEY SIMPLY

02:06:42.594 --> 02:06:44.863
PUT A MORATORIUM IN PLACE ONE

RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL. TO

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:49.001
MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO AND SO

02:06:49.068 --> 02:06:50.703
WE'RE ACTUALLY BEING MORE

02:06:50.769 --> 02:06:52.705
RESTRICTIVE IN SOME WAYS AND IS

02:06:52.771 --> 02:06:54.206
LOCAL MORE TORIA THAT ARE

02:06:54.273 --> 02:06:57.242
ALREADY BEING FORCED RIGHT NOW.

02:06:57.309 --> 02:06:58.277
I AM SURE ONE MORE QUESTION AND

02:06:58.344 --> 02:07:00.913
JUST IT IT SEEMS THAT THE-

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:02.481
ELEMENT HERE IS THE COMMERCIAL

02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:04.283

CLOSURES WHICH IS WHAT

02:07:13.692 --> 02:07:15.894
EVERYBODY USES AT THE LANGUAGE

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:19.231
ONCE YOU GO INTO THE OLD. A ANY

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:21.333

AND ACCEPTING PARTIAL PAYMENTS

02:07:51.263 --> 02:07:53.032
WITH THE COMMERCIAL BANKS AS

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:54.800
PART OF THE THREE WAY THAT'S-

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:56.769
IT'S A TWO WAY NAY SO IN TERMS

02:07:56.835 --> 02:07:58.804

BORROWER RELATIONSHIP AND SO WE

02:08:17.956 --> 02:08:19.158
HAVE A CHALLENGE WITH THIS

02:08:19.224 --> 02:08:20.292
PANDEMIC BUT THERE'S SOME

02:08:20.359 --> 02:08:21.493

SHOULD BE OR WHAT WE'RE WE'RE

02:08:43.515 --> 02:08:46.051
TRYING TO BE. BROAD AND JUST TO

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:47.052
MAKE SURE WE'RE BRINGING PEOPLE

02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:50.189
TO THE TABLE SO THAT'S THE-

02:08:50.255 --> 02:08:50.923
THAT'S THE TRUTH. THANK THANK

YOU SIR ASKING THE- RON SO.

02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:59.398
YEAH THIS IS A BIT IT BROUGHT

02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:01.133
UP A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.502
AND I TALKED TO. OF BOTH SMALL

02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:06.105
BUSINESSES SMALL LANDLORDS AS

02:09:06.171 --> 02:09:11.210
WELL AS- LARGE- LARGE LAND

02:09:11.276 --> 02:09:13.212
OWNERS AND- SAUCE I WAS

02:09:13.278 --> 02:09:14.947
THINKING ABOUT HOW. THE

02:09:15.013 --> 02:09:16.315
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL

02:09:16.381 --> 02:09:19.418
AND COMMERCIAL HERE OF OUR OUR

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:20.819
APPROACH YOU KNOW IN THE

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:23.455
RESIDENTIAL. THERE'S A GREATER

02:09:23.522 --> 02:09:26.558
IMBALANCE BECAUSE- THE SUPPLY

02:09:26.625 --> 02:09:30.095
IS SO SMALL AND THE DEMAND IS

02:09:30.162 --> 02:09:32.164
SO MASSIVE. SO ARMED MEN A

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:34.833
STATE IS. REALLY TRY TO FIGURE

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.802
OUT HOW TO BRING A LITTLE MORE

02:09:36.869 --> 02:09:40.205
BALANCED TO AND I THINK WE'RE

02:09:40.272 --> 02:09:40.772
TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING

02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:41.406
HERE. THIS BUSINESS SMALLERAND

02:09:41.473 --> 02:09:45.811
SMALLER BIGELOW TRYING TO GET

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:48.647
THEM TO THE POINT OF TAKING

02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:50.749
DOING SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS SO

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:53.519
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO

02:09:53.585 --> 02:09:55.854
THE WEEDS OF IT AND TRY TO-

02:09:55.921 --> 02:09:58.023
FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION THAT JUST

02:09:58.090 --> 02:09:59.525
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:02.794
EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME TIME- NO

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:06.231
YOU WANT TO WE DO WANT TO

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:07.499
PROTECT THE SMALL COMMERCIAL

02:10:07.566 --> 02:10:09.501
TEN. TEN AND UP AND I AGREE

02:10:09.568 --> 02:10:11.370
WITH OF PROTECTING SMALL

02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:13.705
BUSINESSES WE'VE WE'VE HEARD

02:10:13.772 --> 02:10:16.175
THAT MANY MANY TIMES IN MY

02:10:16.241 --> 02:10:17.709
DISTRICT THERE'S- THOUSANDS AND

02:10:17.776 --> 02:10:19.545
THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES

02:10:19.611 --> 02:10:21.947
SMALL RESTAURANTS- NEIGHBORHOOD

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:26.919
SHOPS. I BUT I AM CONCERNED

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:29.621
ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:32.090
LARGER COMMERCIAL TENANTS-

02:10:32.157 --> 02:10:36.228
DON'T OF WITH RESOURCES THAT

02:10:36.295 --> 02:10:37.996
THEY DON'T AVOID PAIN RENDON

02:10:38.063 --> 02:10:40.599
THEY DON'T SLIP THROUGH HERE SO

02:10:40.666 --> 02:10:43.035
I WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE ARE

02:10:43.101 --> 02:10:46.238
LARGE RETAILERS WHO ARE-

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:50.509
FLOURISHING. I KNOW THAT'S OF.

02:10:50.576 --> 02:10:52.044
THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S THE KIND

02:10:52.110 --> 02:10:54.313
OF BUSINESS THAT I DON'T THINK

02:10:54.379 --> 02:10:56.148
SHOULD SLIP THROUGH HERE SO.

02:10:56.215 --> 02:10:59.618
WITH BAD ARE A- A NEW AND I

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:01.653
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS IS HOW

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:05.023
DO WE- JUST SOME IDEAS IN TERMS

02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:09.394
OF- WHO. COULD BE OR SHOULD BE

02:11:09.461 --> 02:11:11.230
EXCLUDED OR NOT GIVING THAT

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:14.199
KIND OF PROTECTION- YOU INCLUDE

02:11:14.266 --> 02:11:18.470
PUBLICLY TRADED TENANTS- MAYBE-

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:21.006
EXPANDING TO COVER TENANTS THAT

02:11:21.073 --> 02:11:22.374
ARE FROM MULTINATIONAL

02:11:22.441 --> 02:11:24.810
COMPANIES AN AFFILIATE. OF I

02:11:24.876 --> 02:11:26.111
KNOW YOU HAVE FIVE HUNDRED

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:28.814
EMPLOYEES AS THE AS THE

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:31.116
DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS. I

02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:32.351
DON'T SEE FIVE AND AS A SMALL

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:34.486
BUSINESS- AND I WOULD REALLY

02:11:34.553 --> 02:11:37.756
URGE A MUCH MUCH SMALLER NUMBER

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:38.523
BECAUSE THAT'S WERE REALLY

02:11:38.590 --> 02:11:40.726
TRYING TO DEFEND THE TIME AND

02:11:40.792 --> 02:11:44.096
PROTECT. OF THE TEND TO HAVE OF

02:11:44.162 --> 02:11:45.731
EXCLUDE THOSE WHO HAVE MORE

02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:48.867
THAN THREE LOCATIONS SO I THINK

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:51.003
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- TO MAKE

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:53.071
SURE AGAIN THAT IT'S REALLY THE

02:11:53.138 --> 02:11:55.841
SMALL BUSINESS AND NOT A LARGER

02:11:55.907 --> 02:11:59.211

FORWARD- WE'RE IN CRISIS AND

02:21:12.931 --> 02:21:14.399
HIS SOME OF POINTED OUT THE

02:21:14.465 --> 02:21:16.768
CRISIS ISN'T LIMITED TO TENANTS

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:18.069
IS NOT LIMITED TO SMALL

02:21:18.136 --> 02:21:19.804
BUSINESS OWNERS. IT'S ACROSS

02:21:19.871 --> 02:21:24.142
THE BOARD. I DO THINK THE

02:21:24.209 --> 02:21:24.609
FRAMEWORK THAT YOU'RE

02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:28.313
DEVELOPING. FIRST AND FOREMOST

02:21:28.379 --> 02:21:31.482
SHOULD INCENTIVIZE NEGOTIATION

02:21:31.549 --> 02:21:34.786
NOT STRICT MANDATES BUT

02:21:34.853 --> 02:21:37.488
NEGOTIATION BECAUSE- AS WE HEAR

02:21:37.555 --> 02:21:39.858
SO OFTEN ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT

02:21:39.924 --> 02:21:41.292
ALL AND WE HAVE. YOU MIGHT HAVE

02:21:41.359 --> 02:21:45.029
A SMALL FAMILY RESTAURANT IN

02:21:45.096 --> 02:21:47.365
THE MIGHT BE HAVE A LEASE IN

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:49.634
THE BUILDING. ALSO OWNED BY A

02:21:49.701 --> 02:21:51.769
FAMILY THAT'S FACING TOUGH

02:21:51.836 --> 02:21:55.273
MORTGAGE GADGIL VERSES. MAYBE A

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.308
CHAIN OF THREE RESTAURANTS THAT

02:21:57.375 --> 02:21:58.877
RENDON DIFFERENT PROPERTIES

02:21:58.943 --> 02:22:01.079
FROM ALL LARGER COMMERCIAL

02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:03.481
LANDLORDS SO. TO ME THE

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:04.983
STRENGTH OF THE BILL MOVING

02:22:05.049 --> 02:22:07.819
FORWARD IS TO INCENTIVIZE

02:22:07.886 --> 02:22:11.189
ENCOURAGE NEGOTIATION IN MAY BE

02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:13.458
WITH SOME GUIDELINES I SHARE

02:22:13.524 --> 02:22:15.059
THE CONCERN OF SENATOR TO ROSS

02:22:15.126 --> 02:22:16.694
SO I KNOW THE FIVE HUNDRED

02:22:16.761 --> 02:22:18.596
EMPLOYEES IS A FEDERAL

02:22:18.663 --> 02:22:21.132
DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS

02:22:21.199 --> 02:22:22.600
FIVE HUNDRED OR LESS. TO ME

02:22:22.667 --> 02:22:25.803
THAT SEEMS. LIKE A LOT OF

02:22:25.870 --> 02:22:27.939
EMPLOYEES IN DOESN'T REALLY

02:22:28.006 --> 02:22:30.408
CAPTURE. THE SIZE OF SMALL

02:22:30.475 --> 02:22:32.810
BUSINESSES OPERATING IN MY

02:22:32.877 --> 02:22:35.480
DISTRICT SO I WOULD BE. OPEN TO

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:37.548
SOME REVIEW OF THAT OF THAT CUT

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:42.020
OFF TO REALLY. FOCUS IN ON. HE

02:22:42.086 --> 02:22:44.022
REAL SMALL BUSINESSES FAMILY

02:22:44.088 --> 02:22:46.190
BUSINESSES NIGHT CORPORATE

02:22:46.257 --> 02:22:48.493
CHAINS THAT HAVE FOUR HUNDRED

02:22:48.559 --> 02:22:51.729
AND SEVENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. I

02:22:51.796 --> 02:22:54.198
THINK ON THE GUIDELINES OR OR

02:22:54.265 --> 02:22:55.967
LOOKING NOT TO MANDATES BUT

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:58.703
MAYBE SOME GUIDELINES- IN SOME

02:22:58.770 --> 02:23:01.673
OF THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD.

02:23:01.739 --> 02:23:03.808
THERE WAS A SUGGESTION OF.

02:23:03.875 --> 02:23:06.210
BECAUSE OF LIMITED CAPACITY IN

02:23:06.277 --> 02:23:09.881
A RESTAURANT OR BAR. THE OWNER

02:23:09.948 --> 02:23:11.916
OF THAT BUSINESS LET'S SAY

02:23:11.983 --> 02:23:14.118
MAKES 50% OF WHAT THEY WERE

02:23:14.185 --> 02:23:17.155
MAKING PRETTY COVE IT- AGAIN

02:23:17.221 --> 02:23:18.923
MAYBE A GUIDELINE NOT A

02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:22.327
DIRECTIVE THAT IN THE FRAMEWORK

02:23:22.393 --> 02:23:24.228
WOULD BE TO LOOK AT WITH THE

02:23:24.295 --> 02:23:27.398
LANDLORD AT A 50% ADJUSTMENT.

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:30.601
ON THE RENTAL OBLIGATION- OR

02:23:30.668 --> 02:23:32.203
SOME PROPORTIONAL SO THE

02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:34.706
LANDLORDS NIGHT. SUBSIDIZING

02:23:34.772 --> 02:23:37.809
THE ENTIRE OPERATION ON THE

02:23:37.875 --> 02:23:39.744
RENT SIDE WHEN THE OPERATION IS

02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:42.280
BRINGING IN REVENUES SO THAT

02:23:42.347 --> 02:23:44.415
MIGHT BE A GUIDELINE. ANOTHER

02:23:44.482 --> 02:23:47.085
MIGHT BE SOME ENCOURAGEMENT FOR

02:23:47.151 --> 02:23:51.022
MEDIATION- MANDATORY MEDIATION

02:23:51.089 --> 02:23:53.491
IS KIND OF AN OXYMORON WE KNOW

02:23:53.558 --> 02:23:56.094
THAT THAT EXISTS IN FARM LABOR.

02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.261
UNDER THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR

02:23:57.328 --> 02:23:59.030
LAW INTACT TO MANDATORY

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:01.265
MEDIATION. MAYBE SOME MANDATE

02:24:01.332 --> 02:24:04.268
THAT WITHIN A CERTAIN WINDOW OF

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:06.637
TIME THE PARTIES HAVE TO COME

02:24:06.704 --> 02:24:08.906
TOGETHER IN LOOK AT SOME OF THE

02:24:08.973 --> 02:24:10.742
GUIDELINES OR CRITERIA

02:24:10.808 --> 02:24:14.112
SUGGESTED IN THE BILL- I THINK

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:15.046
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN UPHILL

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:16.781
FIGHT IS YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:18.649
ON THE TWO THIRDS THE URGENCY

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:22.053
BECAUSE BUT IT IS URGENT NEEDS

02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:24.255
THE RELIEF IS NEEDED NOW. NOT

02:24:24.322 --> 02:24:26.457
NEXT YEAR. SO I APPLAUD YOUR

02:24:26.524 --> 02:24:29.060
WORK WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:31.396
CURRENTLY OPPOSED IN. BEING

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:33.498
OPEN TO SOME MAYBE MORE INPUTS

02:24:33.564 --> 02:24:35.199
THAT WOULD MOVE PEOPLE TO A

02:24:35.266 --> 02:24:37.602
NEUTRAL POSITION- IN MAYBE

02:24:37.668 --> 02:24:38.970
AGAIN THROUGH A LOOK AT SOME OF

02:24:39.037 --> 02:24:42.140
THE PROPORTIONAL. GUIDELINE IS

02:24:42.206 --> 02:24:44.142
SUPPOSED TO A MANDATE ON.

02:24:44.208 --> 02:24:46.611
ADJUSTMENT OF RENT OBLIGATION

02:24:46.677 --> 02:24:48.246
SO THOSE ARE MORE COMMENTS NOT

02:24:48.312 --> 02:24:50.214
REALLY A QUESTION BUT THROUGH

02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:52.583
THE CHAIR FEW WANT TO REACT TO

02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:54.452

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:05.063
ALSO SAY. THAT I AGREE WITH YOU

02:25:05.129 --> 02:25:06.798
IT'S ABOUT ENCOURAGING

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.433
NEGOTIATION WITHOUT

02:25:08.499 --> 02:25:10.401
MICROMANAGING BECAUSE IT'S

02:25:10.468 --> 02:25:11.903
ALWAYS GONNA BE DIFFERENT ONE

02:25:11.969 --> 02:25:13.504
THING I WANT TO STRESS. THIS IS

02:25:13.571 --> 02:25:15.673
NOT ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW SOMEONE

02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:16.574
HAS FIVE OR TEN YEARS UNDER A

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:18.509
LEASE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:20.478
WE WANT WHEN YOU'RE GONNA

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:21.446
AUTOMATICALLY RESTRUCTURE THE

02:25:21.512 --> 02:25:24.182
LEASE TO PERMANENTLY CHANGE IT.

02:25:24.248 --> 02:25:25.716
IT COULD BE BUT YOU GET A RENT

02:25:25.783 --> 02:25:26.617
REDUCTION FOR THE NEXT FOUR

02:25:26.684 --> 02:25:28.653

THAT'S TAILORED TO THE

02:25:42.266 --> 02:25:44.769
CIRCUMSTANCES IN TIME TABLE

CONTINUE TO DO SO- WE YOU KNOW

02:26:09.427 --> 02:26:10.728
WE DON'T USUALLY REGULATE

02:26:10.795 --> 02:26:12.430
COMMERCIAL TENDENCIES LIKE WE

02:26:12.497 --> 02:26:13.798
DO RESIDENTIAL TENANCIES

02:26:13.865 --> 02:26:14.832
BECAUSE WE PERCEIVE THAT

02:26:14.899 --> 02:26:16.367
THERE'S GREATER PARITY BETWEEN

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:18.436
THE PARTIES. TO A COMMERCIAL

02:26:18.503 --> 02:26:20.505
LEASE IT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE BUT

02:26:20.571 --> 02:26:21.506
BY AND LARGE COMMERCIAL

02:26:21.572 --> 02:26:23.407
TENANTS- KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

02:26:23.474 --> 02:26:24.575
DOING AND CAN HOLD THEIR OWN

02:26:24.642 --> 02:26:26.677
AGAINST COMMERCIAL LANDLORD.

02:26:26.744 --> 02:26:28.079
STATE DOESN'T USUALLY GET

02:26:28.146 --> 02:26:30.281
INVOLVED WITH CLEARLY. WE ARE

02:26:30.348 --> 02:26:32.550
IN A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD AND I

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:33.918
THINK WE ALL HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

02:26:33.985 --> 02:26:36.387
THAT YES WE COULD LITIGATE THIS

02:26:36.454 --> 02:26:37.488
AND MAYBE THAT IS WHAT WILL

02:26:37.555 --> 02:26:40.658
HAPPEN BUT THE EXPECTATIONS ON

02:26:40.725 --> 02:26:42.193
WHICH RESTAURANTS AND BARS AND

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:43.628
SMALL BUSINESSES GROUNDED THEIR

02:26:43.694 --> 02:26:44.762
DECISIONS WHEN THEY SIGNED

02:26:44.829 --> 02:26:47.331
THEIR LEASES HAS BEEN TOTALLY

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:49.200
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. AND I THINK

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:50.735
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE ARE

02:26:50.801 --> 02:26:53.171
LIVING IN A WORLD THAT MOST OF

02:26:53.237 --> 02:26:55.306
US COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED. AND

02:26:55.373 --> 02:26:58.142
SO- I HEAR WHAT THE OPPOSITION

02:26:58.209 --> 02:27:00.278
SAYING ABOUT HOW THE- THE BILL

02:27:00.344 --> 02:27:02.847
INTERFERES WITH CONTRACT AND-

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:03.514
IN ALL THOSE TRADITIONAL OLD

02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:05.650
CONCERNS THAT ARE EXPRESSED

02:27:05.716 --> 02:27:09.253
BUT- YOU KNOW THIS IS A WORLD

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.555
WHERE WE'RE REQUIRING SOCIAL

02:27:10.621 --> 02:27:14.125
DISTANCING KEEPING PEOPLE HOME.

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:14.592
RESTRICTING DINING IN

02:27:14.659 --> 02:27:16.894
RESTRICTING. HOW FOOD CAN BE

02:27:16.961 --> 02:27:18.462
PRESENTED ESSENTIALLY

02:27:18.529 --> 02:27:21.132
RESTRICTING PROFITS. AND SO WE

02:27:21.199 --> 02:27:23.167
ARE ALREADY RADICALLY ALTERED

02:27:23.234 --> 02:27:24.802
IN THIS REALITY UPON WHICH

02:27:24.869 --> 02:27:27.038
THOSE CONTRACTS WERE BASED AND

02:27:27.104 --> 02:27:29.006
I MEAN A YOU KNOW CORONAVIRUSES

02:27:29.073 --> 02:27:30.975
THE ONE THAT INTERFERED WITH

02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:32.510
THESE CONTRACTS. AND I JUST

02:27:32.577 --> 02:27:34.412
THINK WE HAVE TO READ AND SAID

02:27:34.478 --> 02:27:35.980
TO PRETEND THAT THIS HAS NOT

02:27:36.047 --> 02:27:38.316
IMPACTED EVERY PART OF OUR

02:27:38.382 --> 02:27:40.351
DAILY LIVES. IS JUST TO BE

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:43.387
LIVING UNDER A ROCK. I MEAN WE

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:44.889
ARE ALL EXPERIENCING THE FACT

02:27:44.956 --> 02:27:45.957
THAT WE HAVE TO HEAR WITH THESE

02:27:46.023 --> 02:27:48.259
STUPID MASKS ON. THE THAT ARE

02:27:48.326 --> 02:27:51.128
FAR UP GLASSES I DON'T KNOW BUT

02:27:51.195 --> 02:27:52.163
ANYBODY ELSE BUT IF YOU'VE GOT

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:53.331
A WAY TO AVOID THAT LET ME

02:27:53.397 --> 02:27:56.767
KNOW- BUT OUR JOB. AS I SEE IT

02:27:56.834 --> 02:28:01.205
IS TO DO A THING WE CAN TO GIVE

02:28:01.272 --> 02:28:04.609
SMALL BUSINESSES AND

02:28:04.675 --> 02:28:08.512
RESTAURANTS AND BARS AND- OTHER

02:28:08.579 --> 02:28:11.849
BASED ON ARE. THE TOP OF THE-

02:28:11.916 --> 02:28:14.418
THIS. SHOULD NOT BE A FINANCE

02:28:14.485 --> 02:28:17.722
BENEFIT. TO ANYBODY ESPECIALLY

02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:20.224
AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS AND I

02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:21.826
THINK YOU HEARD FROM US SENATE

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:23.728

ABOUT CREATING AN UNFAIR

02:28:28.733 --> 02:28:30.501
PLAYING FIELD WHICH IS NOT WHAT

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:34.138
I THINK YOU. WANT TO DO AND SO-

02:28:34.205 --> 02:28:35.740
I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE

02:28:35.806 --> 02:28:36.974
MEMBERS I THINK THAT THEY'VE

02:28:37.041 --> 02:28:38.476
GREATLY TIGHTENED AND

THAT IF IT WAS FAKE IN THE

02:46:35.185 --> 02:46:38.021
MAINTAIN. AGAIN THE OPPOSITION

02:46:38.088 --> 02:46:38.855

PEOPLE DO THIS PROFESSIONALLY.

02:46:40.757 --> 02:46:41.991
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT COVERS

IMAGINE THERE MAY BE SOME

02:49:07.303 --> 02:49:09.005
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE COUNTY

02:49:09.072 --> 02:49:10.340
MAY BE ABLE TO EFFECT BUT I

02:49:10.406 --> 02:49:11.774
DON'T THINK ACROSS THE BOARD

02:49:11.841 --> 02:49:13.776
THIS COULD BE DONE JUST BUT

02:49:13.843 --> 02:49:16.279
COUNTY BY COUNTY. I THINK THAT

02:49:16.346 --> 02:49:20.083
FOR US TO ENSURE THAT ANY THAT

02:49:20.149 --> 02:49:22.285
WE LIMIT THE BUNDLING AND SUCH

02:49:22.352 --> 02:49:25.154
WE WOULD NEED THIS STATE OF A

STATUTE. OKAY IN TERMS OF.

02:49:31.094 --> 02:49:33.263
LOCAL CONTROL FOR ENFORCING

02:49:33.329 --> 02:49:36.132
VIOLATIONS. IN MY PREVIOUS

02:49:36.199 --> 02:49:38.701
CAPACITY ON THE BOARD OF

02:49:38.768 --> 02:49:41.004
SUPERVISORS IN THE VALLEY. IS

02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:43.506
THAT THE COUNTY OR A

02:49:43.573 --> 02:49:47.610
MUNICIPALITY HAS THE ABILITY TO

02:49:47.677 --> 02:49:50.146
ENFORCE VIOLATIONS AND IF THEY

02:49:50.213 --> 02:49:52.382
DON'T MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY

02:49:52.448 --> 02:49:53.516
WHICH IS WHAT WE EXPERIENCE

02:49:53.583 --> 02:49:56.119
WHEN THE BANK OWNED PROPERTIES

02:49:56.185 --> 02:49:58.588
WERE- OCCURRING YOU KNOW

02:49:58.655 --> 02:50:00.924
CIRCUIT TWENTY TEN TWENTY

02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:02.759
ELEVEN. IS THAT THE COUNTY

02:50:02.825 --> 02:50:04.427
COULD STEP IN AND MAINTAIN THE

02:50:04.494 --> 02:50:08.164
PROPERTY AND THEN ATTACH A LEAN

02:50:08.231 --> 02:50:10.300
TO THE TITLE WHENEVER.THAT WAS

02:50:10.366 --> 02:50:11.668
TO BE TRANSFERRED I GUESS WHAT

02:50:11.734 --> 02:50:14.404
I'M GETTING AT IS I SEE WHAT

YOU'RE TRYING. TO ACCOMPLISH

02:50:19.409 --> 02:50:20.109
HERE BUT I'M LOOK AT A FROM A

02:50:20.176 --> 02:50:23.813
LOCAL AUTHORITY STAND. THAT THE

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:25.848
POWER EXIST WITH THOSE ENTITIES

02:50:25.915 --> 02:50:28.418
TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESIRED OUTCOME

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:30.553
WITHOUT US ARE CREATING

02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:34.023
STATEWIDE RULES THAT MAY HAVE

02:50:34.090 --> 02:50:37.760
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. IF YOU

02:50:37.827 --> 02:50:39.429
HAVE ANY FINAL THOUGHTS ON THAT

02:50:39.495 --> 02:50:41.664
THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE. I'M

02:50:41.731 --> 02:50:43.866
AS I INDICATED ABOUT WITH THE

02:50:43.933 --> 02:50:45.301
QUESTION THAT SENATOR Y. CASKEY

02:50:45.368 --> 02:50:48.972
ASKED THE STATUTE BEFORE YOU IF

02:50:49.038 --> 02:50:51.841
WE ADOPT SB TEN SEVENTY NINE

02:50:51.908 --> 02:50:55.545
JUST CREATES THE ABILITY FOR A

02:50:55.612 --> 02:50:56.112
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE

02:50:56.179 --> 02:50:57.680
ITS FINE. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:50:57.747 --> 02:50:59.515
NOT CHOOSE TO IT DOES NOT FORCE

02:50:59.582 --> 02:51:03.119
THEM TO. AND WHAT YOU'RE

02:51:03.186 --> 02:51:05.288
DESCRIBING PERHAPS COUNTIES

02:51:05.355 --> 02:51:07.757
COULD HAVE DONE THAT DURING THE

02:51:07.824 --> 02:51:09.892
LAST RECESSION IN FORECLOSURE

02:51:09.959 --> 02:51:13.229
CRISIS. BUT IN- BUT I THINK NOT

02:51:13.296 --> 02:51:15.298
ONLY MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT

02:51:15.365 --> 02:51:17.400
THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY

02:51:17.467 --> 02:51:18.201
COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE

02:51:18.267 --> 02:51:21.971
STATE WHEN- BUT MANY OF THE-

02:51:22.038 --> 02:51:24.607
PROPERTIES WERE LEFT VACANT THE

02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:26.676
CITIES WERE PUT IN EXTRA NEARLY

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:31.080
DIFFICULT POSITION. TO IT TO.

02:51:31.147 --> 02:51:34.484
IT HAVE TOOLS THAT WOULD FORCE

02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:36.786
THE OWNERS TO EAT TO MAINTAIN

02:51:36.853 --> 02:51:39.022
THE PROPERTIES OR TO. PUT THEM

02:51:39.088 --> 02:51:41.257
ON THE MARKET OR PUT A TENDON

02:51:41.324 --> 02:51:44.193
IN THEM AND- SO WHAT WE REALLY

02:51:44.260 --> 02:51:46.062
WANT TO DO IS PREVENT THAT

02:51:46.129 --> 02:51:49.298
SCENARIO- AND THAT IS THE-

02:51:49.365 --> 02:51:52.602
INTENT OF THAT PART OF THE

02:51:52.669 --> 02:51:54.470
LEGISLATION BUT AGAIN IT IS

02:51:54.537 --> 02:51:56.839
COMPLETELY ELECTIVE IF THE- IF

02:51:56.906 --> 02:51:59.342
CITY X. OR Y. CHOOSES NOT TO

02:51:59.409 --> 02:52:01.044
THAT IS THEIR CHOICE. AND I

02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:03.980
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE FINES

02:52:04.047 --> 02:52:05.748
NOW ARE A THOUSAND DOLLARS A

02:52:05.815 --> 02:52:07.483
DAY THAT'S THE MAX THE CAN BE

02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:09.686
UNDER STATE LAW AND THAT IF WE

02:52:09.752 --> 02:52:11.721
REACHED OUT TO A THOUSAND BACK

02:52:11.788 --> 02:52:13.523
IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT DUE

02:52:13.589 --> 02:52:15.625
TO THIS PROBLEM BUT IT WAS NOT

02:52:15.692 --> 02:52:17.527
ADEQUATE. INCENTIVE FOR SOME

02:52:17.593 --> 02:52:21.998
ENTITIES. THANK YOU WELL I

02:52:22.065 --> 02:52:25.068
APPRECIATE- ON YOU RESPONDING

02:52:25.134 --> 02:52:28.237
TO MY QUESTIONS I THINK OF THE

02:52:28.304 --> 02:52:31.140
OUTCOME I THINK HAS MERIT THE

02:52:31.207 --> 02:52:33.142
DESIRED OUTCOME HAS MERIT I AM

02:52:33.209 --> 02:52:38.381
CONCERNED. THAT LIMITING THREE

02:52:38.448 --> 02:52:41.918
PROPERTIES- IS GOING TO CREATE

02:52:41.984 --> 02:52:45.021
CHALLENGES FOR COUNTIES WHEN

02:52:45.088 --> 02:52:47.356
THEY HAVE THEIR PROCESS ALL AT

02:52:47.423 --> 02:52:50.126
THE COURTHOUSE WERE THE BEATING

02:52:50.193 --> 02:52:52.095
BECAUSE THEY WANT ONE LO THESE

02:52:52.161 --> 02:52:54.831
PROPERTIES. AND I THINK MAKING

02:52:54.897 --> 02:52:56.966
IT DIFFICULT FOR LARGER

02:52:57.033 --> 02:52:59.102
ENTITIES TO PURCHASE IN MARKET

02:52:59.168 --> 02:53:02.371
PLACE- MAY HAVE AN UNINTENDED

02:53:02.438 --> 02:53:03.506
CONSEQUENCE THAT CARRIES MAY

02:53:03.573 --> 02:53:06.242
NOT UP FOR BUT THANK YOU FOR

02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:08.778
YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ANY OTHER

02:53:08.845 --> 02:53:09.979
COMMENTS QUESTIONS LET ME

02:53:10.046 --> 02:53:12.815
CHANGE TO CLOSE THE WITH AN

02:53:12.882 --> 02:53:15.485
OBSERVATION THAT I. RECOGNIZE

02:53:15.551 --> 02:53:17.453
HIS BILL STILL RELATIVELY.

02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:19.922
PATIENT IN ITS CONCEPTUAL PHASE

02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:21.190
AND I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS

02:53:21.257 --> 02:53:24.393
ARE HAVE HELPED TO FLUSH OUT OF

02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:26.429
THE CONTENT MORE AND HOPEFULLY

02:53:26.496 --> 02:53:27.764
THE ANALYSIS HELPS TO POINT

02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:29.532
OUT. SOME OF THE REMAINING

02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:32.969
CHALLENGES- WORK IN PROGRESS

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:34.470
THE BILLS ARE SOMETIMES

02:53:34.537 --> 02:53:36.339
PROBLEMATIC AND WE DON'T

02:53:36.405 --> 02:53:36.906
GENERALLY IN THIS COMMITTEE

02:53:36.973 --> 02:53:38.674
LIKE TO SEE THEM BUT- UNDER THE

02:53:38.741 --> 02:53:40.343
CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES IN WORLD

02:53:40.409 --> 02:53:42.812
WE LIVE IN- I THINK THIS BILL

02:53:42.879 --> 02:53:45.181
IS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO

02:53:45.248 --> 02:53:47.517
CONTINUE- AGAIN ESPECIALLY

02:53:47.583 --> 02:53:49.585
SINCE WE ARE LIKELY TO FACE A

02:53:49.652 --> 02:53:52.121
NEW FORECLOSURE WAVE. IN THE

02:53:52.188 --> 02:53:53.790
NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE I HOPE

02:53:53.856 --> 02:53:57.160
NOT BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

02:53:57.226 --> 02:53:59.529
REALISTIC AND- THIS BILL MAY

02:53:59.595 --> 02:54:01.464
NOT REVERSE A DYNAMIC TOTALLY

02:54:01.531 --> 02:54:04.333
BUT- YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:05.902
THAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS A WE

02:54:05.968 --> 02:54:08.805
DON'T DO ENOUGH- THE AS WE SAW

02:54:08.871 --> 02:54:10.706
FROM LAST THE LAST TIME IT

02:54:10.773 --> 02:54:13.176
REALLY CAUSED. ENORMOUS A PAIN

02:54:13.242 --> 02:54:14.811
AND SUFFERING TO WAY TOO MANY

02:54:14.877 --> 02:54:17.446
PEOPLE SO. WITH THAT- ALL MOVED

02:54:17.513 --> 02:54:19.182
BILL ART WE HAVE CENTER WHY

02:54:19.248 --> 02:54:21.050
BECAUSE GIVE THE MOTION I WANT

02:54:21.117 --> 02:54:22.919
TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS- I THINK

02:54:22.985 --> 02:54:25.655
MOST OF US. WOULD LIKE TO KEEP

02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:26.756
THIS GOING WE'LL FIND OUT BUT

02:54:26.823 --> 02:54:28.491
CERTAINLY RESERVE THE RIGHT

02:54:28.558 --> 02:54:30.293
PROCEEDING- GOING FORWARD TO

02:54:30.359 --> 02:54:31.360
SEE HOW THE BILL ULTIMATELY

02:54:31.427 --> 02:54:33.863
COMES OUT SO WITH THAT- MAY I

02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:35.932
HAVE A MOTION AND- IF YOU WOULD

02:54:35.998 --> 02:54:37.233
LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR SKINNER

THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. THE IF

02:54:42.271 --> 02:54:43.940
FIRST OFF I WANT TO CLARIFY

02:54:44.006 --> 02:54:45.675
THAT THIS DOES NOT PREVENT A

DECIDED TO PLACE THE DEFINITION

OF COURSE OF CONTROL AND THE

02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:34.697
FAMILY CODE. THIS BILL IS

02:59:34.763 --> 02:59:36.432
CRITICAL BECAUSE DOMESTIC

02:59:36.499 --> 02:59:38.100
VIOLENCE IS NOT LIMITED TO

02:59:38.167 --> 02:59:40.302
PHYSICAL ABUSE IT ALSO INVOLVES

02:59:40.369 --> 02:59:42.738
A PATTERN OF POWER AND CONTROL

02:59:42.805 --> 02:59:44.507
THROUGH WHICH ABUSERS DOMINATE

02:59:44.573 --> 02:59:47.643
EVERY ASPECT OF THE VICTIM'S

02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:48.811
LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY PANDEMIC

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:50.980
HAS ONLY PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON

02:59:51.046 --> 02:59:53.182
THIS ISSUE AS WE SEE NOW. MORE

02:59:53.249 --> 02:59:55.251
CASES ARE RESURFACING AND WE

02:59:55.317 --> 02:59:57.219
HEAR FROM. ADVOCATES AND SAFE

02:59:57.286 --> 03:00:00.022
HOUSES AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS

03:00:00.089 --> 03:00:01.957
THAT THE CALLS ARE INCREASING

03:00:02.024 --> 03:00:04.360
DRAMATICALLY. A RECENT LA TIMES

03:00:04.426 --> 03:00:05.895
ARTICLE STATED THAT WE ARE IN

03:00:05.961 --> 03:00:07.062
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR

03:00:07.129 --> 03:00:07.897
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DURING

03:00:07.963 --> 03:00:10.533
SHELTER IN PLACE. AND I BELIEVE

03:00:10.599 --> 03:00:11.767
THAT SOCIAL ISOLATION IS THE

03:00:11.834 --> 03:00:13.602
IDEAL SITUATION FOR AN ABUSER.

03:00:13.669 --> 03:00:16.238
IT GUARANTEES FULL CONTROL AND

03:00:16.305 --> 03:00:19.408
POWER. AWAY FROM PEOPLE EXAMPLE

03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:20.176
OF COURSE OF CONTROL CAN

03:00:20.242 --> 03:00:23.179
INCLUDE. BUT NOT LIMITED TO

03:00:23.245 --> 03:00:27.049
CONSTANT MANIPULATION. AND-SURVEILLANCE THE GRADUAL

03:00:27.116 --> 03:00:28.984
ISOLATION AWAY FROM FAMILY AND

03:00:29.051 --> 03:00:32.188
FRIENDS. WHAT HOLDING FINANCES

03:00:32.254 --> 03:00:34.390
IN BASIC NECESSITIES. WHICH CAN

03:00:34.456 --> 03:00:36.592
INCLUDE EVEN PROHIBITING A

03:00:36.659 --> 03:00:39.495
VICTIM FROM GOING TO SCHOOL OR

03:00:39.562 --> 03:00:40.095
GETTING TOGETHER WITH

03:00:40.162 --> 03:00:42.498
COWORKERS. AND IT MAKES IT

03:00:42.565 --> 03:00:45.067
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR VICTIMS

03:00:45.134 --> 03:00:45.701
TO ESCAPE THAT ABUSE. THE

03:00:45.768 --> 03:00:48.437
PHRASE OF CONTROL EXPLAINS THIS

03:00:48.504 --> 03:00:50.606
PARTICULAR RANGE OF BEHAVIORS

03:00:50.673 --> 03:00:52.107
MANY STATES ACROSS THE US HAVE

03:00:52.174 --> 03:00:53.609
ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE

03:00:53.676 --> 03:00:55.277
IMPORTANCE OF USING COURSE OF

03:00:55.344 --> 03:00:58.614

03:01:18.601 --> 03:01:20.336
HOWEVER TO ME THE MOST ALARMING

03:01:20.402 --> 03:01:23.138
STATISTIC FOUND. THAT CONTROL

03:01:23.205 --> 03:01:23.839
WITH AN INTIMATE PARTNER

03:01:23.906 --> 03:01:26.475

THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT TESTIMONY

03:17:36.411 --> 03:17:38.146
CELL. MY POINT IS THAT WE JUST

03:17:38.213 --> 03:17:40.381
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN ON

03:17:40.448 --> 03:17:41.583
THIS CASE HAD THEY BEEN BLE TO

03:17:41.649 --> 03:17:43.318
BRING AND HER SITUATION ALL

03:17:43.384 --> 03:17:44.752
THE- THREADS HER EX HAS BEEN

03:17:44.819 --> 03:17:46.588
MADE AND- IN REGARDS TO HURTING

03:17:46.654 --> 03:17:48.423
HER SON'S KIDNAPPING HIM AND

03:17:48.489 --> 03:17:49.757
ALL THAT. MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE A

03:17:49.824 --> 03:17:51.593
DIFFERENT OUTCOME BUT I WILL

03:17:51.659 --> 03:17:52.193
CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE FISH

03:17:52.260 --> 03:17:54.295
AND SEE HOW WE CAN. CLARIFY IT

03:17:54.362 --> 03:17:55.730
I MEAN IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR

03:17:55.797 --> 03:17:57.532
CUT DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY.

03:17:57.599 --> 03:17:59.400
BUT IN HER CASE IT DIDN'T WORK

03:17:59.467 --> 03:18:00.969
SO WE WANT THE SYSTEM TO WORK

03:18:01.035 --> 03:18:02.270
AND MAKE SURE THERE'S NO BAKE

03:18:02.337 --> 03:18:03.905
NOUS. BUT I'M COMMITTED TO

03:18:03.972 --> 03:18:05.373
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH

03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:06.841
CANCER WE CAN CLARIFY THAT OR-

03:18:06.908 --> 03:18:09.110
SEE IF IT'S NECESSARY BUT I

03:18:09.177 --> 03:18:10.211
WILL LOOK FURTHER INTO IT. YEAH

03:18:10.278 --> 03:18:11.512
I THINK I THINK INCLUDING

03:18:11.579 --> 03:18:12.680
COURSE OF CONTROL IN THE

03:18:12.747 --> 03:18:14.916
DEFINITION WILL HAVE A THIRD.

03:18:14.983 --> 03:18:18.052
OUR BENCH DECIDED THIS IS THIS

03:18:18.119 --> 03:18:20.355
IS A APART OF ABUSE THAT THAT

03:18:20.421 --> 03:18:21.623
LEVEL LIKE IT. AND I GET

03:18:21.689 --> 03:18:23.324
DIRECTLY INDIRECTLY SHE'S

03:18:23.391 --> 03:18:27.762
THROUGH ANY INSTRUMENTALITY.

03:18:27.829 --> 03:18:28.863
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MAY I

03:18:28.930 --> 03:18:30.031
ADD IN YOUR RIGHT WE'VE HAD

03:18:30.098 --> 03:18:30.698
THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT

03:18:30.765 --> 03:18:32.467
INSTRUMENTALITY AND I WANT TO

03:18:32.533 --> 03:18:34.535
WORK ON CLARIFYING THAT. WHAT'S

03:18:34.602 --> 03:18:36.938
HAPPENING WITH THE- WITH SOCIAL

03:18:37.005 --> 03:18:38.339
MEDIA JUST GROWING AT SUCH A-

03:18:38.406 --> 03:18:40.575
FAST PACE FOR EXAMPLE TWITTER

03:18:40.642 --> 03:18:42.343
AND FACEBOOK WAS IN OUT. AROUND

03:18:42.410 --> 03:18:44.345
IN THE EIGHTIES NINETIES IT

03:18:44.412 --> 03:18:46.381
GETS- THERE'S MORE ODDS TOOLS

03:18:46.447 --> 03:18:47.782
THAT ABUSES CAN USED TO

03:18:47.849 --> 03:18:48.716
MANIPULATE EMBARRASS HER

03:18:48.783 --> 03:18:50.818
HUMILIATE INDIVIDUALS. AND SO

03:18:50.885 --> 03:18:53.087
WE WERE TRYING TO. MAKE SURE

03:18:53.154 --> 03:18:54.589
THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS

03:18:54.656 --> 03:18:55.823
BUT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT AND

03:18:55.890 --> 03:18:57.659
WE START NAMING THE TOOLS THAN

03:18:57.725 --> 03:18:59.627
IT LIMITS. THE ABILITY FOR

03:18:59.694 --> 03:19:01.029
SOMEONE TO SAY. YOU KNOW A NEW

03:19:01.095 --> 03:19:02.897
TOOL COMES UP LIKE SPY WARE AND

03:19:02.964 --> 03:19:04.666
I WAS IN PART OF THAT. YOU KNOW

03:19:04.732 --> 03:19:06.534
WHAT WE NAMED SO WE DIDN'T WANT

03:19:06.601 --> 03:19:08.803
TO BE VERY- PRESCRIPTIVE SOUL

03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:11.572

THEY'RE LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS

03:19:20.982 --> 03:19:21.916

YOUR WITNESS TO AND EXPRESS OUR

03:21:01.916 --> 03:21:03.851
CONDOLENCES FOR HER LAWSON

SHARE THAT STORY WITH THIS SOME.

03:21:09.123 --> 03:21:10.958

03:21:11.025 --> 03:21:13.261
EXAMPLE OF YOUR WITNESS WAS

03:21:13.327 --> 03:21:15.930
EXTRAORDINARY RESULTING IN

03:21:15.997 --> 03:21:19.667
DEATH THE MURDER OF HER SON. IN

03:21:19.734 --> 03:21:22.837
MANY CASES IT'S NOT AS EXTREME

03:21:22.904 --> 03:21:25.740
IN TERMS OF THE OUTCOME BUT THE

03:21:25.807 --> 03:21:27.809
PSYCHOLOGICAL VIOLENCE-

03:21:27.875 --> 03:21:30.144
VIOLENCE TO THE SPIRIT. THAT'S

03:21:30.211 --> 03:21:32.413
WHAT'S NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED BY

03:21:32.480 --> 03:21:35.716
THE COURTS IN YOUR BILL SEEKS

03:21:35.783 --> 03:21:38.219
TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE RANGE OF

03:21:38.286 --> 03:21:41.789
FORMS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST

03:21:41.856 --> 03:21:44.158
VICTIMS AND THE COURTS HAVE

03:21:44.225 --> 03:21:46.093
BEEN NARROW IN MY VIEW-

03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:47.995
LIMITING IN INTERPRETATION OF

03:21:48.062 --> 03:21:50.565
VIOLENCE TO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE-

03:21:50.631 --> 03:21:52.366
VIOLENCE TO THE SPIRIT VIOLENCE

03:21:52.433 --> 03:21:53.968
TO THE HEART CONTROLLING.

03:21:54.035 --> 03:21:56.471
SOMEBODY'S ACCESS TO RESOURCES

03:21:56.537 --> 03:21:59.207
CONTROLLING ACCESS TO FAMILY

03:21:59.273 --> 03:22:02.577
MEMBERS THREATS THREATS OF.

03:22:02.643 --> 03:22:05.012
ELIMINATING ACCESS TO A CHILD.

03:22:05.079 --> 03:22:07.748
IN MANY WAYS THAT VIOLENCE IS

03:22:07.815 --> 03:22:11.352
MORE PAINFUL MORE LASTING VAN.

03:22:11.419 --> 03:22:13.221
THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE THIS MAY

03:22:13.287 --> 03:22:16.524
RESULT IN THE WOUND HEALS BUT

03:22:16.591 --> 03:22:18.726
THE TH THE VIOLENCE TO THE

03:22:18.793 --> 03:22:19.594
SPIRIT THE VIOLENCE TO THE

03:22:19.660 --> 03:22:22.330
HEART IN SOME CASES NEVER HEALS

03:22:22.396 --> 03:22:25.132

WE ALSO ARE VERY PROUD IN OUR

03:23:12.113 --> 03:23:15.750
SYSTEM OF THE- PEOPLE HAVING

RIGHT WHEN THERE ARE ALL OF

03:23:19.987 --> 03:23:22.590
WRONGFUL ACCUSATIONS SO I GUESS

03:23:22.657 --> 03:23:26.594
MY QUESTION IS HOW. HOWEVER

03:23:28.162 --> 03:23:32.166
PEOPLE OF- WHO GET ACCUSED OF

03:23:32.233 --> 03:23:34.035
THIS ESPECIALLY WHEN CHILDREN

03:23:34.101 --> 03:23:36.370

DIVORCES AND- THOSE KINDS OF

03:23:46.213 --> 03:23:48.482
WHEN THAT HAPPENS THERE ARE.

ALL SORTS OF. THINGS THAT YOU

03:23:51.619 --> 03:23:54.155
KNOW PEOPLE GET ACCUSED OF- AND

03:23:54.221 --> 03:23:55.323

HAVE THE WAY TO DEFEND

03:24:03.564 --> 03:24:05.566
THEMSELVES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

03:24:05.633 --> 03:24:07.602
QUESTION- CARRIER INTENT IS NOT

TO CATCH ANYONE IN THE SYSTEM

03:24:09.236 --> 03:24:11.005

TESTIMONY WASN'T EVEN ALLOWED

03:24:23.284 --> 03:24:25.252
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A NAME TO

IT SO IT IS ON BOWLING PATTERN

03:24:28.389 --> 03:24:30.291
AND IT'S ALSO STILL UP TO THE

03:24:30.358 --> 03:24:31.692
INTERPRETATION OF THE JUDGE TO

03:24:31.759 --> 03:24:34.228
TEAM DAD EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY.

03:24:34.295 --> 03:24:36.330

BELIEVE THE QUESTION IS

03:43:15.782 --> 03:43:17.584

DOES- PARTIALLY- I THINK I CAN

03:43:54.020 --> 03:43:56.055
APPRECIATE THE PREDICAMENT THAT

03:43:56.122 --> 03:43:59.225
INDIVIDUALS ARE IN WHEN THEY

03:43:59.292 --> 03:44:01.127
DON'T HAVE THE MEANS BY WHICH

03:44:01.194 --> 03:44:03.463
TO ACHIEVE OF FACTORS THAT GO

03:44:03.530 --> 03:44:06.733
INTO CREDIT WORTHINESS ARE.

03:44:06.800 --> 03:44:10.503
STANDARDS IT JUST SEEMS A

03:44:10.570 --> 03:44:12.205
LITTLE UNFAIR TO THE

03:44:12.272 --> 03:44:14.808

STATE ASSISTANCE. AND NOT

03:44:29.889 --> 03:44:31.024
HAVING THE DISCRETION OVER

03:44:31.090 --> 03:44:32.425
THOSE DOLLARS THAT WOULD

03:44:32.492 --> 03:44:35.562
NORMALLY GO TO THE RIGHT

03:44:35.628 --> 03:44:36.529
BECAUSE IT'S PRESCRIBED. THE

MORE THAN TEN UNITS PER UNIT

03:46:00.780 --> 03:46:02.181

TRADITIONAL TENANT- THE ANOMALY

THE PROVISION FROM LAST YEAR

AND THAT. THE NOTION THAT WE

04:52:44.647 --> 04:52:46.615
SORT OF WE WORKED ON ALL THESE

04:52:46.682 --> 04:52:48.250
DETAILS OF ENFORCEMENT ALREADY

AND WHAT WHAT YOU FEEL IS

04:52:49.451 --> 04:52:50.719
REALLY LACKING IN THE CURRENT

ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK THAT

04:52:51.887 --> 04:52:54.056
JUSTIFIES THIS EXPANSION WELL I

04:52:54.123 --> 04:52:56.025
WASN'T YOU KNOW IN THE

04:52:56.091 --> 04:52:57.593
BACKGROUND OF PUTTING THAT BILL

04:52:57.660 --> 04:52:59.161
TOGETHER BUT I CERTAINLY

04:52:59.228 --> 04:53:02.164
SUPPORTED IT BECAUSE- BEING

04:53:02.231 --> 04:53:03.532
ABLE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF

04:53:03.599 --> 04:53:05.200
PROTECTION WITH JUST BECAUSE WE

04:53:05.267 --> 04:53:06.869
HAD DISCUSSED IT AND I HAD A- A

04:53:06.936 --> 04:53:10.873
BILL MYSELF- WHAT WE FOUND AND

04:53:10.940 --> 04:53:13.642
WHAT WE'VE- HEARD BACK IS. THAT

04:53:13.709 --> 04:53:16.045
THE IDEA OF HAVING TO GO TO THE

04:53:16.111 --> 04:53:18.213
TURN ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE IT

04:53:18.280 --> 04:53:21.150
MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A

04:53:21.216 --> 04:53:23.986
TENANT- TO BE ABLE TO ASSERT

04:53:24.053 --> 04:53:25.254
THIS NEW THESE NEW RIGHTS OF

04:53:25.321 --> 04:53:27.456
THESE NEW PROTECTIONS AND SO

04:53:27.523 --> 04:53:30.292
DOING THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL-

04:53:30.359 --> 04:53:34.330
FACILITATED THAT- AND WAS JUST.

04:53:34.396 --> 04:53:35.965
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO BE ABLE

04:53:36.031 --> 04:53:39.301
TO DO THAT THING GOING TO THE

04:53:39.368 --> 04:53:40.402
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

04:53:40.469 --> 04:53:41.704
THE JUST TO CLARIFY IS IT

04:53:41.770 --> 04:53:43.539
PURELY. IT'S PURELY

04:53:43.605 --> 04:53:44.940
ADMINISTRATIVE OR HAVE THE

04:53:45.007 --> 04:53:47.042
ACTUAL FINES AND PENALTIES

CHANGE THEMSELVES AND MORE THE

04:53:48.944 --> 04:53:51.180
VAN YOU THINK THAT. THAT THE

04:53:51.246 --> 04:53:53.415
CITY ATTORNEY. OR DISTRICT

04:53:53.482 --> 04:53:55.050
ATTORNEY OR COUNTY COUNCIL CAN

DO THIS ENFORCEMENT OR DO WE

04:53:57.453 --> 04:54:01.457
ACTUALLY CHANGE THE. THE LEVEL

04:54:01.523 --> 04:54:03.993
OF FINES OR PENALTIES. EIGHTY

04:54:04.059 --> 04:54:07.830
TWO FRAMEWORK BY THE WAY SIR I

04:54:07.896 --> 04:54:11.266
SHOULD I SHOULD BE ABLE TO. IS

04:54:11.333 --> 04:54:18.440
BRIAN AUGUSTA STILL ON THE LINE.

04:54:18.507 --> 04:54:23.145
I AM OKAY BRIAN BARGER. YES

04:54:23.212 --> 04:54:26.281
PLEASE YOU COULD YOU ANSWER THE

04:54:26.348 --> 04:54:28.117
LAST QUESTION THE ANSWER. YES

04:54:28.183 --> 04:54:29.685
THE ANSWER THE CENTERS QUESTION

04:54:29.752 --> 04:54:31.887
IS THAT IT DOES ADD A NEW

04:54:31.954 --> 04:54:34.023
PROVISION THAT WHAT AUTHORIZED.

04:54:34.089 --> 04:54:36.759
ADDITIONAL PROSECUTION OR LEVY

04:54:36.825 --> 04:54:39.561
FINES UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND

04:54:39.628 --> 04:54:41.230
DOLLARS IF THE LOCAL

04:54:41.296 --> 04:54:44.633
GOVERNMENTS. CHOSE TO IMPLEMENT

04:54:44.700 --> 04:54:46.301
WHAT THE STATE AUTHORIZED THEM.

04:54:46.368 --> 04:54:48.804
KAREN SO EXISTING LAWS HAS A

04:54:48.871 --> 04:54:53.175
LESSER FINE OR RESTITUTION IN.

04:54:53.242 --> 04:54:56.145
WELL RIGHT NOW THERE'S

04:54:56.211 --> 04:54:57.479
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM AND

04:54:57.546 --> 04:54:59.214
CURRENT LAW IS GENERALLY OF THE

04:54:59.281 --> 04:55:00.816
SENATE AS THE AUTHOR OF THAT

04:55:00.883 --> 04:55:02.584
THAT WILL BE WITH THE ATTORNEY

04:55:02.651 --> 04:55:04.219
GENERAL OR MAYBE UNDER SOME

04:55:04.286 --> 04:55:07.956
OTHER THEORY- ANOTHER LOCAL

04:55:08.023 --> 04:55:09.792
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL LIKE THAT

04:55:09.858 --> 04:55:10.859
SHOULD BE ATTORNEY OR DISTRICT

04:55:10.926 --> 04:55:12.327
ATTORNEY CAN IN FOR SOME

04:55:12.394 --> 04:55:14.063
PORTIONS OF THE LAW BUT IS

04:55:14.129 --> 04:55:16.131
GENERALLY SOMETHING FORCING

04:55:16.198 --> 04:55:18.300
RESPECT TO A TENANT WHO WOULD

04:55:18.367 --> 04:55:20.869
RAISE THESE ISSUES AND THE FANS

04:55:20.936 --> 04:55:22.438
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

04:55:22.504 --> 04:55:24.907
THAT- AND IN DIFFERENT AND I'M

04:55:24.973 --> 04:55:29.144
OFF A PAIR OF ONE OF. THE

04:55:29.211 --> 04:55:30.379
THINGS THAT HAVE COME OUT. HE

04:55:30.446 --> 04:55:31.680
IS HOW DO YOU GET OUT SOME OF

04:55:31.747 --> 04:55:32.848
THE CRACK THAT OCCUR THE LOCAL

04:55:32.915 --> 04:55:36.418
WHERE. THAT BEING THE ONLY

04:55:36.485 --> 04:55:40.456
DEFENSE. IS OUT OF TO CRACK. BY

04:55:40.522 --> 04:55:43.459
LANDLORDS. A TENANT REALLY DID

04:55:43.525 --> 04:55:45.694
NOT AND POSITION TO STOP AND SO

04:55:45.761 --> 04:55:49.064
I THINK THE CON HERE IS. TO

04:55:49.131 --> 04:55:51.166
ALLOW GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT

04:55:51.233 --> 04:55:53.535
AND HAVE SOME OF THE REMEDIES

04:55:53.602 --> 04:55:56.004
THAT THE- SEPARATELY WOULD

04:55:56.071 --> 04:56:00.509
ALLOW. I'M TO BETTER IN COME

04:56:00.576 --> 04:56:02.845
WITH THE LOCAL WHERE THEY KNOW

04:56:02.911 --> 04:56:03.479
THE PRACTICES THAT ARE GOING ON

04:56:03.545 --> 04:56:06.615
THAT YOU THAT LEVEL ENFORCEMENT.

04:56:06.682 --> 04:56:08.650

I SHOULD THE MY DILIGENCE

04:56:14.590 --> 04:56:17.526
BITTERNESS BUT- AYE AYE I

04:56:17.593 --> 04:56:19.061
STRONGLY SUPPORT THE FIRST

04:56:19.128 --> 04:56:20.295
SECTION ON IMMEDIATE FAMILY

04:56:20.362 --> 04:56:22.131

04:56:22.197 --> 04:56:22.998
VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT CENTER

04:56:23.065 --> 04:56:25.634
BUT- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

04:56:25.701 --> 04:56:27.669
ABOUT THE DEAL STRUCK LAST YEAR

04:56:27.736 --> 04:56:29.171
IN THOSE FINAL PROVISION SO

04:56:29.238 --> 04:56:30.939

ALL RIGHT OF ANY OTHER

04:56:38.180 --> 04:56:43.685
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS- I THINK

04:56:43.752 --> 04:56:46.355
THE TO DO LIST THIS BILL DOES

04:56:46.421 --> 04:56:50.192
REFLECT THE NEED. MY EXPERIENCE

04:56:50.259 --> 04:56:52.261
WITH UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS

04:56:52.327 --> 04:56:54.363
IS THEY AREN'T AS A MEDIA. AS

04:56:54.429 --> 04:56:56.265
THE NEED IS THAT THEY CAN TAKE

04:56:56.331 --> 04:56:58.500
MONTHS I KNOW LA COUNTY IT'S

04:56:58.567 --> 04:57:01.670
NOTORIOUS. WITH THE SITUATION-

04:57:01.737 --> 04:57:03.639
THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED UNDER

04:57:03.705 --> 04:57:05.841
COVERT NINETEEN WHEN THE COURTS

04:57:05.908 --> 04:57:07.342
TO GET BACK ALL THEY'RE GOING

04:57:07.409 --> 04:57:08.911
TO BE DOING IS CRIMINAL CASES

04:57:08.977 --> 04:57:11.280
OF FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS

04:57:11.346 --> 04:57:12.915
BECAUSE OF THIS BACKLOG.

04:57:12.981 --> 04:57:14.983
UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS WILL

04:57:15.050 --> 04:57:18.086
BE LACKING IN THE THEORY IS

04:57:18.153 --> 04:57:20.088
THAT THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY

04:57:20.155 --> 04:57:21.190
ENFORCEABLE AND IF THAT WERE

04:57:21.256 --> 04:57:22.624
THE CASE I THINK THAT MY

04:57:22.691 --> 04:57:25.160
CREATED DIFFERENT SITUATION BUT

04:57:25.227 --> 04:57:27.496
THAT IS NOT THE REALITY SHOW.

04:57:27.563 --> 04:57:31.466
WITH THAT. OUR MARRIAGE IS LESS.

04:57:31.533 --> 04:57:34.469
MERIT BETTER FOR SOME SUSPECT

04:57:34.536 --> 04:57:38.040

LOOKING AT THE BILL AND IN THE

04:57:59.261 --> 04:58:04.233
EXISTING LAW IT INDICATES THAT.

04:58:04.299 --> 04:58:08.036
ALL I CAN IT IS ELIGIBLE YOU

04:58:08.103 --> 04:58:09.905

TENANTS HAS FILED A REPORT.

04:58:20.682 --> 04:58:23.652
SURE EXISTING LAW IT INDICATES

04:58:23.719 --> 04:58:26.488
THAT A RECORD IS ALL THAT'S

04:58:26.555 --> 04:58:29.691
NEEDED. AND THEN MOVING INTO

04:58:29.758 --> 04:58:34.863
THE NEW SECTION. OF. SUBSECTION

04:58:34.930 --> 04:58:38.066

PHYSICAL INJURY OR EMOTIONAL

04:58:40.302 --> 04:58:43.305
INJURY. I GUESS I'M A LITTLE

04:58:43.372 --> 04:58:47.943
CONCERNED THAT. COULD THIS BE

04:58:48.010 --> 04:58:52.381
ABUSE BY INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO

04:58:52.447 --> 04:58:54.583
RELOCATE OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

04:58:54.650 --> 04:58:57.185
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO CANCEL OUT

COHABITANTS OR IN PARTNERSHIP

04:59:02.557 --> 04:59:05.360
IN SOME FASHION. COULD THIS BE

04:59:05.427 --> 04:59:07.629
ABUSE INSTEAD IS MY QUESTION TO

04:59:07.696 --> 04:59:09.531
THE AUTHOR UNDER A SCENARIO

04:59:09.598 --> 04:59:13.435
WHERE. ONE PARTY. FILES A

SECTION IN ALLEGES EMOTIONAL

04:59:19.708 --> 04:59:24.313
INJURY. AND BY VIRTUE OF THOSE

04:59:24.379 --> 04:59:27.649
TWO OCCURRENCES ARE LEAST IS

04:59:27.716 --> 04:59:32.921
CAN BE BROKEN- THEREAFTER THE

AUTHORED THROUGH THE CHAIR OUR-

04:59:36.091 --> 04:59:37.659
COMMENTS ON WHETHER THIS COULD

04:59:37.726 --> 04:59:40.295
BE USED GIVEN THAT THERE SEEMS

04:59:40.362 --> 04:59:42.731
TO BE. SOME ALL ENCOMPASSING

04:59:42.798 --> 04:59:47.736
LANGUAGE. IF I MAY ARM IF YOU

04:59:47.803 --> 04:59:50.439
LOOK AT A AMENDMENT ONE. IT TO

04:59:50.505 --> 04:59:53.575
IT TIGHTENS UP OF THE LANGUAGE

04:59:53.642 --> 04:59:55.344
WITH RESPECT TO CRIMES AND IT

04:59:55.410 --> 05:00:00.115
ALSO REMOVES EMOTIONAL INJURY.

05:00:00.182 --> 05:00:00.749
SO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT CREATE A

05:00:00.816 --> 05:00:04.353
CLARITY. JOE MOTIONAL INJURY-

05:00:04.419 --> 05:00:05.721
OR THREAT OF PHYSICAL INJURY

BRANDISHING OR USE OF A FIREARM

OR OTHER DEADLY WEAPON-

05:00:18.133 --> 05:00:20.035
INSTRUMENT. A CRIME THAT

05:00:20.102 --> 05:00:21.737
INCLUDED THE USE OF FORCE

AGAINST THE VICTIM OR THE

05:00:23.972 --> 05:00:26.541
THREAT OF FORCE AGAINST THE

05:00:26.608 --> 05:00:27.976
VICTIM SO WE HAVE SPECIFIED

05:00:28.043 --> 05:00:29.311
MADE IT MUCH CLEARER. IN
