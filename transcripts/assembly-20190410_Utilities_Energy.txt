ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON UTILITIES AND ENERGY -- WE ARE WAITING FOR FOR COMPLEMENT OF MEMBERS SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM BUT UNTIL SUCH TIME WILL OPERATE AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF MISTER BY STIR YOU HAVE NO OBJECTIONS OKAY -- WE HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS AGAIN MISTER -- EDUARDO GARCIA IS ABSENT TODAY MISTER NAZARIAN WILL BE FILLING IN FOR HIM WE HAVE A COUPLE OF ITEMS ON CONSENT ITEM TO A. B. NINE TWENTY THREE WEEKS I DON'T FOR A BI TEN SEVENTEEN ORDER HOWEVER AND WE HAVE -- MS BURKE WHO WILL BE PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA THAT'S ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY SIX ITEM ONE AND -- ALSO BE PRESENTING ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE NINETY THREE LIVING NO NO NO NO JUST JUST LET EVERYONE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE AND AND ACTUALLY MOST AFTER MS FREEMAN AFTER YOU PRESENT YOUR TWO BILLS THAT WILL BE ALL COMMITTEE SO WE'LL WE'LL TURN TO YOU AT THAT POINT BUT FOR NOW WILL WELCOME YOU -- FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ON ITEM FIVE A. B. ELEVEN FORTY FOUR TO BE FOLLOWED BY ITEM EIGHT AB. SEVENTEEN NINETY NINE I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS POLICY AND I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING MORE FREQUENT AND DEADLY WILDFIRES DURING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE THE LARGEST BUYERS EVER RECORDED IN HISTORY. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT A MAJORITY OF THE SOURCES OF IGNITION FOR WILDFIRES ARE DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITY INCLUDING ENERGIZED ELECTRIC POWER LINES. DE ENERGIZING POWER LINES HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A MITIGATION MEASURE TO REDUCE AND IGNITION SOURCES DURING PERIODS OF ELEVATED FIRE RISK. HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THAT REALLY LEADS TO SIGNIFICANTLY READ LIZ SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE SERVICE RELIABILITY FOR COMMUNITIES IN THESE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS OF HAS A HAVE ALREADY HAD THEIR ELECTRICITY SHUT OFF DURING DE ENERGIZING EVENTS. AND THAT OF COURSE IS DISTURBING TO RESIDENTS AND CAN BE LIFE THREATENING IF IT THERE ARE A VULNERABLE POPULATION. ON THE OTHER HAND ENERGY STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES LOCATED IN AFFECTED COMMUNITIES CAN ENABLE ESSENTIAL LOADS TO REMAIN SERVICE IN THE FACE OF MORE FREQUENT THE ENERGY. ENTERED DE ENERGY STATION EVENTS AND PROVIDE RESILIENCY FOR THE COMMUNITY. AB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR REQUIRES CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO USE UP 210% OF THE SELF GENERATION AND INCENTIVE PROGRAM FROM FROM TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TO BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES IN HIGHER FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS. THE INCENTIVE FUNDS FROM THIS BILL COULD SUPPORT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE LARGE FACILITIES SUCH AS WATER SUPPLIERS WASTE WATER AGENCIES HOSPITALS AND CAMPUSES. AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SMALL FACILITIES SUCH AS SCHOOLS AND FIRE STATIONS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY AS A WITNESS IS JOHN KENNEDY FROM RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC THE RURAL COUNTIES -- OUR MEMBER COUNTIES HAVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S FORESTED LANDS AND WE'VE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE RECENT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. SO WITH THAT WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF EVERY EFFORT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRE -- SEVERAL OUR COUNTY IS WORD DE ENERGIZED IN AN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN EVENT -- ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS HAVE THEIR POWER SHUT OFF SOME OF THEM WERE THAT POWER FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS UNTIL P. JEANNIE COULD INSPECT THE LINES AND RESTORE POWER -- THAT YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THE INTERPRETATION TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES BUT AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THERE ARE RISKS THAT COME WITH IT. SO A LOT OF THE RESIDENTS WERE WITHOUT WATER FOR DRINKING -- COULDN'T FLUSH TOILETS -- THERE WERE SOME COMPROMISED WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS -- THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF VIOLATING SOME -- BURN OFF LAWS SO WE DO THIS BILL AS BEING A A COMPLIMENT TO PROMOTE LOCAL RESILIENCY TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES -- DEAL WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF EVENTS -- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE FOCUS OF THE BILL ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE POLICE STATIONS FIRE DEPARTMENTS SCHOOLS WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES ESPECIALLY HOSPITALS HAVE TO REMAIN OPEN -- THERE'S NOT AN OPTION FOR THEM TO BE POWERED DOWN DURING THESE TYPES OF EVENTS SO WE THINK THIS WILL HELP OUR COMMUNITIES BE A LITTLE MORE RESILIENT -- HELP OUR RESIDENTS AS THEY WORK THROUGH THESE TIMES -- LOOK FOR TO SEEING HOW THE AS CHIP PROGRAM CAN ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS IN THE THIRD NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE USED IN THE PROGRAM OR OTHER PROGRAMS. THAT WILL HELP US DEAL WITH AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THE ENERGY STATION SO WITH THAT WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL OF SO COME FORWARD. AND WE ARE TAKING. THOSE WHO JUST INTRODUCE YOURSELF. YOUR AFFILIATION. YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL MY NAME IS MICHAEL DAY I'M WITH TRAIN WHICH IS A DIVISION OF INGERSOLL RAND -- AND I'M HERE SPEAKING TODAY ON ONE OF OUR A COMMUNITY THAT WERE WORKING WITH THEM LAKE COUNTY WHICH IS A MEMBER OF RC RC -- WORKING WITH HIDDEN VALLEY LAKE AND AND SEVERAL OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN A HIGH FIRE DANGER AREA THEY'VE HAD FOUR MAJOR WILD FIRES IN THE LAST SIX YEARS. THEY'VE SUFFERED FROM DE ENERGY IS ATION AND AS WE'VE BEEN HELPING THEM LOOK AT THINGS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR THE LEADERSHIP THAT SHOWN BY THIS BILL. BUT WE WANTED TO BRING UP SOME THINGS THAT WERE SAYING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION THAT MIGHT WANT TO BE CONSIDERED. THE SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT'S THAT'S BEING LOOKED UTILIZED AS A GREAT VEHICLE FOR THIS BUT THERE ARE SOME PARTS THAT ARE IN CONGRESS WITH THE WITH THE INTENT HERE. FIRST OFF THE SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS CAPPED. AT ONE MAKE A WHAT. THE INCENTIVES GET CUT IN HALF AND THEN ABOVE TO MAKE WHAT'S THEIR OF THEIR ELIMINATED AND THIS COULD BE FOR LARGER FACILITY SO COULD BE WORKING AGAINST IT. ALSO THIS IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THINGS THAT ARE A LONGER DURATION STORAGE AND THE S. CHIP INCENTIVE IS CUT IN HALF AT TWO HOURS AND THEN IT'S CUT IN HALF AGAIN OF FOUR HOURS. SO THE WAY THAT THE S. CHIP IS CURRENTLY INCENTIVES ARE CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. IS NOT EXACTLY AN ALIGNMENT AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WHERE DIRECTION THE P. YOU SEE WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. THE LAST PART IS IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE S. CHIP PROGRAM. IN ITS ENABLING REG REGULATIONS BUT IN REALITY THE THE THINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED. TO MOVE FORWARD OR THOSE THAT ARE EMBODIED IN THE S. CHIP HANDBOOK PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS HANDBOOK. IF WE DON'T HAVE SOMETHING IN THERE THAT ALLOWS THE PROJECTS THAT ARE DONE HERE -- TO TO POTENTIALLY COME UP WITH ANSWERS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED IN THE HANDBOOK THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO BE EVALUATED. AND SINCE WE'RE LOOKING FOR INNOVATION THAT'S IT AGAIN A LOT OF SUPPORT HERE FROM OUR PARTNERS IN HIDDEN VALLEY LAKE SOME A LOT OF OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT COMMENTS ON ON REAL REAL LIFE BOOTS ON THE GROUND PROBLEMS CAN BE ADDRESSED IN THE LEGISLATION TO HELP MAKE IT THE SUCCESS THAT WE ALL NEED IT TO BE. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAD ONE WITNESS WILL LET THAT. COMMENT YOUR SECOND WITH US AND THIS IS JUST NAME. FILIATION AND YOUR SUPPORT YEP MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DAN CHAU WITH US LOWER CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORT OF STILL REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS. ARE ENCOURAGED BY THEM -- BUT ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEY'RE NOT SO RESTRICTIVE -- AND AND THAT THE PC -- CAN DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT TYPES OF RELIABILITY PROJECTS -- CAN BE -- ELIGIBLE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE -- WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IS ARE THERE ANY. QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. IS OUR MOTION. SECOND OKAY -- IT. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE YEAH I'M GONNA HEAD OF A YEAH WE'RE GOOD. NO WE CANNOT A CORNER WE YES NO IT JUST WE JUST IN OUR HEADS WERE COUNTING INCIDENT WERE THERE.

OKAY THE MOTION WOULD BE -- WE WERE SEVEN OSHA DO PASS A NATURAL RESOURCES AS HAS OUR SUPPORT AN ENDORSEMENT AND THE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE TAKEN AND NATURAL RESOURCES. YES CRESCENT THEIR MOTION TO THAT EFFECT. SECOND OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. I SEE NO OUR COMMENTS BUT SEVERAL CALL ON THE MOTION. UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I'M JUST SO I REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE VOICES OF SUPPORT -- MOVING STORAGE AND INTO OUR VULNERABLE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IS A GOAL THAT I THINK WE ALL HAVE AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTIONS WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE THIS -- WORKABLE FOR ALL OF OUR WORLD COMMUNITIES AND AND EVERYBODY ELSE THANK YOU FANTASTIC THANK YOU FOR THE BILL. ROLL CALL ON THE MOTION. MOTIONS TO PASS TO NATURAL SCIENCE NATURAL RESOURCES WITH THE NAME IS TAKEN IN NATURAL RESOURCES. HOLDEN HI HOLDEN HI PATTERSON PATTERSON I BURKE [inaudible] I CARILLO. CHEN. CUNNINGHAM. EGGMAN. EGGMAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I WAS VERY YOUNG. MAYES -- WHERE TWO G. MAYOR CITY AYE QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE REYES? SANTIAGO. I TING. WED ZERO AS EIGHT VOTES SO. THE BILL CLEARS BUT WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR APPS MENTORS OUT AT ON YOUR NEXT BILL IS -- ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY SEVENTEEN NINETY NINE YES I THINK THAT'S IT IS ALSO -- HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WITH AMENDMENTS. TO NATURAL RESOURCES AMENDMENTS BE TAKEN A NATURAL RESOURCES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE IN THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE AND I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON PAGE. FIVE RECENT PRICE. THANK YOU -- THIS IS ABOUT LOOKING INTO WHY NATURAL GAS MARKETS HAVE BEEN SO VOLATILE WE'VE BEEN APPROACH FIRE UTILITIES AND PROBABLY MANY OF YOU AS WELL TO FIND OUT WHAT'S BEHIND THESE. PRICE SPIKES AND SO WE WOULD LIKE -- TO REALLY UNDERSTAND -- WHAT IS CAUSING THEM ON AB SEVENTEEN NINETY NINE REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA REGARDING NATURAL GAS MARKETS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF NATURAL GAS PRICE VOLATILITY EXPERIENCED BY AND USE CUSTOMERS? THE CDC WOULD ESTABLISH THE JOINT AGENCY NATURAL GAS MARKET OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO GATHER ANALYZE MAKE REFERRALS TO THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHAT DATE IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CAUSES A PRICE VOLATILITY AND THE STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN TO LIMIT -- WELL A LOT OF THE STATE IS SUBMITTED TO THE STATE IS DONE SO IN A PIECE BILL MANNER AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR UTILITIES -- WE HAVE A THREE IN MY DISTRICT -- SAY THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THESE BIKES ARE HAPPENING AND WHEN -- SO THIS WILL REQUIRE THE COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUAL NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANY DATA IN A MORE HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS ALL LOAD SERVING AND OF THESE I USE MUNY SINCE CCA'S TO SUBMIT WHOLESALE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PLANS THESE PLANS WOULD INCLUDE HOW THEY WOULD REDUCE THE RISK FROM PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE WHOLE SO ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS MARKETS. WHILE REDUCING OVERALL GREENHOUSE GASES AND INCREASING THE USE OF CLEAN ENERGY -- WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY AS A WITNESS IS TIM O'CONNOR WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH THIS IS REALLY A TRANSPARENCY BILL I'M AT ITS CORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WICKS GOOD AFTERNOON MR HOLDEN -- TIM O'CONNOR WITH THE ENVIRONMENT DEFENSE FUND. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES CALIFORNIA'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL REMAKING OUR ELECTRICITY SYSTEM FROM ONE WHICH WAS. BASED ON COAL AND OIL TO ONE WHICH DAY IS BASED ON GAS AND RENEWABLES. AND WE HAVE AT THE SAME TIME HAVE HAD GAS UTILITIES WHICH HAVE. INVESTED HEAVILY IN A GAS DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOW MOST OF OUR HOUSES AND BUSINESSES ARE CONNECTED AND TIED INTO THAT SYSTEM. SO AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE NATION'S SECOND LARGEST USER OF NATURAL GAS OVER 90% OF WHICH IS IMPORTED -- HAS MANY PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY WHICH ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO GAS PRICES TO NATURAL GAS PRICES IS IN WITHIN THIS CONTEXT WE FIND OURSELVES TODAY. FOR ABOUT THE LAST NINE YEARS THE ENERGY SECTOR AS WITNESS PROLONGED VERY LOW PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS. AND THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO ADVANCEMENTS IN UNCONVENTIONAL GAS PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND A LARGE -- NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS SO LAST YEAR WHEN NATURAL GAS PRICES BEGAN TO SPIKE IN EXPERIENCE SUDDEN SHARP INCREASES. MANY WERE LEFT UNPREPARED RESULTING IN ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA EXPENDITURES FOR ELECTRICITY ALONE. AT A RECENT -- ENERGY COMMISSION MEETING ON THE SUBJECT OF PRICE VOLATILITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE EIGHT OTHER THE AGENCY COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE TRUE BECAUSE OF THE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS THAT WAS FOLLOWED UP BY TESTIMONY BY SI PC PRESIDENT. MICHAEL PICKER BEFORE US SENATE OVERSIGHT. HEARING -- ON MARCH TWELFTH THAT THE CAUSE OF THOSE GAS PRICE SPIKES COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED -- WITH ABSOLUTE CLARITY WAS OF THE LEASE -- CANYON OUT IT WAS IT PROLONGED OUTAGES OF TRANSMISSION PIPELINES INTO THE SERVICE TERRITORY NOBODY COULD SAY FOR CERTAIN. EDF RECENTLY PERFORMED AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH DATA IS AVAILABLE FOR USE BY AGENCIES TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF CHANGING STATE POLICIES ON THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM IN ITS VULNERABILITY. TO IS TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS AS ANALYSIS HERE WITH ME TODAY OUR ANALYSIS FOUND THAT WELL MOST OF THE INFORMATION EXISTS IT'S NOT REGULARLY AVAILABLE AND ENERGY AGENCIES CANNOT AND DO NOT EVALUATED IN A COORDINATED AND HOLISTIC MANNER. THUS NO AGENCY HAS A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE VULNERABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO PRICE SWINGS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND HOW INVESTMENT DECISIONS GOING FORWARD CAN MITIGATE IT. AS THIS ISSUE MOVES FORWARD JUST HAVING THE DAD OF COURSE WON'T BE ENOUGH INFORMED DECISIONS MUST RESULT THAT'S WHY WE THINK THAT THE BILL'S PROVISION TO REQUIRE LECTURE PROVIDERS TO EMBED INTO THEIR LONG TERM ENERGY PLANS. STRATEGIES TO LIMIT THEIR EXPOSURE PRICE VOLATILITY WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT. ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPECT FOR LIVE BY THE THANK YOU -- WILL NOW TAKE THE OTHERS ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THE BILL NAME AND MEMBERS JOHN WHITE WITH A CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN WE THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT BILL VERY TIMELY AND FOR ALL THE REASONS STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR TERM MEMBERS JENNA PRICE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. BRENNAN DAWSON WAS SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- IS THERE ANYONE HERE THEY WOULD WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON I WILL TURN NOW. TO OUR FIRST ITEM FILE ITEM ONE SENATE BILL FIFTY SIX AS I MENTIONED AT THE ONSET. OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUARDO GARCIA IS -- OUT -- TODAY -- BUT HAS -- CONSENTED -- TO SIMILAR BURKE TO PRESENT HIS BILL -- TODAY SO WE APPRECIATE THAT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COMMENTS IN HERE FROM HERE SEC. THEY'RE GONNA BE GRIPPING AYE FROM CAN I LET ME JUST -- LET ME JUST LET YOU KNOW TOO THAT -- THE RECOMMENDATION IS A DO PASS -- TO NATURAL RESOURCES AND THESE AMENDMENTS. THERE ARE AMENDMENTS AND THEY WOULD BE TAKEN AND NATURAL RESOURCES YES SO I I SPEAK TO THEM AND THE STATEMENT. THE STATEMENT THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO ME HERE ALL RIGHT -- OKAY SO CAN I ADDRESS THEM AT THAT TIME. YES YOU CAN GREAT -- SO GOOD AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TODAY 2% AB FIFTY SIX ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA. BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL ANALYSIS AND AND BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE SITUATION. THAT THE PRIMARY AUTHOR OF THIS BILL HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- WE ARE WE WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS HOWEVER I'M. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WELL ACTUALLY HIM IN ITS STAFF AND I HAVE AGREED THAT WILL TAKE THEM AT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THAT WITH THE HOPE THAT THE BILL MOVES FORWARD -- WE WILL TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL MOVE THE BILLS THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE ENERGY IN ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES DRINKING THE INCLUSION OF PO USE. AND LIMITING THE POTENTIAL SCOPE OF PROCUREMENT. BUT WE WOULD APPRECIATE A COMMITMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS LANGUAGE CAN BE CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSED AND REVISE ONCE THE AUTHOR -- IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE INTHOSE DISCUSSIONS. I DON'T KNOW IS THAT IT OKAY YES SIR AND THAT'S A YES. THAT'S A YES WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO HIM I THINK -- THE BILL WILL CREATE THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT NO ONE DISAGREES WITH THE NATURE OF ENERGY PROCUREMENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED. CURRENTLY IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH OUR GREAT FOR ANY REASON THE STATE IS LEFT WITH LITTLE RESOURCE RECOURSE OUR OPTIONS TO ALLOW US TO ACT QUICKLY. THIS NEW AUTHORITY WILL NOT INTERFERE AT ALL WITH THE PROCUREMENT AS IT CURRENTLY HAPPENS BY THOSE SERVING ENEMIES AND IS NARROWLY DEFINED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC SITUATIONS. AS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE. AB FIFTY SIX DESIGNS THIS NEW AUTHORITY TO OPERATE LIKE A UTILITY THAT ONLY ACTS WHEN THE WHEN DIRECTED TO BY THE STATE AND IS SUBJECT TO ST STRICT STATE OVERSIGHT. IN THE EVENT THAT THE AUTHORITY DOES PURCHASE POWER ANY ASSOCIATED BENEFITS AND COSTS LEFT OVER AFTER THAT POWERS SOLD WILL BE PASSED ON TO REPAIRS. BUT IS THE GOAL THAT THE BENEFITS IN THOSE SITUATIONS WOULD FAR OUTWEIGH ANY COSTS. THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE FOR CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS NOT FRIEDMAN FROM THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL -- THE BILL. COMES AT A VERY CRITICAL TIME -- AND WOOD. DEVELOP A NEW BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT MECHANISM. FOR A LIKE TRICITY IN RELIABILITY PRODUCTS UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES TO MEET THE STATE'S RELIABILITY CLEAN ENERGY CLIMATE RESOURCE PLANNING GOALS. I'M WE ARE AS A STATE AT YET ANOTHER CROSSROADS -- WE HAVE A RISE IN COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION INCREASES IN DIRECT ACCESS. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES FACING SERIOUSCREDIT CHALLENGES ONE OF WHOM IS IN BANKRUPTCY -- AND BIG QUESTIONS CIRCLING ABOUT WHAT THE ROLE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE. IN THE FACE OF THAT THE STATE HAS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT TO COORDINATED RESOURCES AND RELIABILITY PLANNING. THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE EVEN GREATER VALUE NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN STATE OVERSIGHT OVER THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE GOALS. COULD SET THE STAGE FOR THE NEXT ENERGY CRISIS OUR GOALS TO AVOID THAT TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT. LANDING THAT IS NOT BEING REALIZED THROUGH ACTUAL PROCUREMENTS THAT ARE BEING SEEN IN THE MARKET BY RETAIL PROVIDERS -- CAN BE DONE FOR A BACKSTOP MECHANISM AN EXISTING STATE LAW HAS THOSE BACKSTOP MECHANISMS TODAY TO THE EXTENT THAT RELIABILITY NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER EXISTING LAW TO GO OUT. AND PROCURE BRAND NEW RESOURCES IN CHARGE ALL CUSTOMERS FOR IT. IF THE I USED DON'T DO IT. THE CALIFORNIA I SO HAS THE ABILITY TO STEP IN AND EXECUTE CONTRACTS FOR RELIABILITY RESOURCES AND TO CHARGE EVERYBODY. AND ALL OF THOSE COMMITMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. IF WE DO NOTHING THOSE BACKSTOPS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE. BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO DESIGN A NEW BACKSTOP MECHANISM. TO THE ALTERNATIVES THAT WE HAVE ARE TO INCREASE THE ROLE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. AND THE CALIFORNIA I SO. TO GO DEEPER ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PROCUREMENT BY THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES LIKE CCA'S AND DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS. FOR DEVELOP AN INDEPENDENT MECHANISM THAT CAN BE AVAILABLE TO STATE POLICYMAKERS TO USE AS NEEDED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL WILL NOT DO. THIS BILL WOULD NOT TRANSFER ALL OF THE PROCUREMENT RESPONSIBILITIES TO CENTRAL BUYER. ON THE ENTITY WOULD SERVE AS A BACKSTOP BUYER FOR RESOURCES NOT PROCURED BY OTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES BUT DEEMED NECESSARY TO MEET GRADE RELIABILITY AND THE SATISFIED DEFICITS IDENTIFIED. IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS. IT WOULD NOT CREATE A NEW AGENCY THAT IS VESTED WITH POLICY MAKING AUTHORITY -- OR DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY. THIS ENTITY WOULD BE A TOOL THAT SIMPLY COULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE STATE POLICY OBJECTIVES NO POLICY WOULD BE MADE IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE ALL OF ITS PROCUREMENT AUTHORIZED IN ADVANCE AND APPROVED AFTER THE FACT. BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY UTILITIES WORK NOW ADVANCED DIRECTION FROM THE REGULATORS AFTER THE FACT REVIEW AND APPROVAL TO MAKE SURE ANY COMMITMENTS ARE REASONABLE AND TO APPROVE THE COLLECTION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE COMMITMENTS. I'M THIS APPROACH LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES THAT WE MADE DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND WHEN THE STATE WAS IN CRISIS. WE DEPUTIZED THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO GO OUT AND SURVEY THE BACKSTOP ROLE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY. WELL THEY BOUGHT A LOT OF POWER BUT THERE WAS NO REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF WHAT THEY DID. THAT WAS A MISTAKE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THAT TWICE. THIS BILL COME IS A OFFERED A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH WHERE THE BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT WOULD BE OVERSEEN BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROCUREMENT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEEDS OF THE STATE. IT WOULD NOT BE APPROVED. THE OTHER THING THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO IS IT DOES NOT HARM RETAIL COMPETITION. FOR THE EMERGENCE OF COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION. THE BILL CLEARLY STATES THAT CCA'S AND DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCURING TO MEET 1100% OF THEIR CUSTOMERS NEEDS. IT'S ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO RESPECT THE AUTONOMY OF LOAD SERVING ENTITIES AND TO FACILITATE INCREASED RETAIL COMPETITION AND A HIGHER PENETRATION OF COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION. ON THE PROCUREMENT THAT'S DONE ON A BACKSTOPS BASIS WOULD REDUCE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR ALL OF THESE ENTITIES. SO EVERYONE WOULD GET CREDIT FOR THE PROCUREMENT THAT'S DONE. BUT THE POWER WOULDN'T BE ALLOCATED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS SPECIFICALLY LEAVING THOSE PORTFOLIOS OPENED TO BE FILLED BY THE LOCAL -- BUYERS TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS NEEDS. THE BILL ALSO DOES NOT ESTABLISH ANY NEW PROCUREMENT MANDATES DOES NOT AUTHORIZE PROCUREMENT BEYOND WHAT IS AUTHORIZED IN EXISTING LAW. IT LEADS ALL EXISTING PROGRAMS AND REQUIREMENTS COMPLETELY UNCHANGED. THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO UNDERSTAND. THE BILL ITSELF. IDENTIFIES PROCUREMENT. TO MEET RESOURCE ADEQUACY NEEDS THAT ARE ON MATT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS THE TOPIC TO BE DEALT WITH BY A CENTRAL BUYER IN A RECENT DECISION. IT ALSO LOOKS AT INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING IMMIGRANT RESOURCES PLANNING DEFICITS THE P. YOU SEE IN A PROPOSED DECISION THAT IS DUE TO BE VOTED OUT NEXT WEEK -- WOULD ESTABLISH A PROCUREMENT TRACK IN WHICH IT WILL BE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY CENTRAL BUYER AND UNDER EXISTING LAW THAT CENTRAL BUYER. IS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. WE ALSO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE UNDER THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM. STARTING IN. 202165% OF ALL COMPLIANCE MUST BE SOURCE FROM LONG TERM CONTRACTS. WELL THE RBS PROGRAM HAS A PROVISION ALREADY. THAT ALLOWS THE PC TO AUTHORIZE A PROCUREMENT ENTITY. ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS TO DO PROCUREMENT ON BEHALF OF SMALL OF SERVING ENTITIES. THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE MEETING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THIS. ONE THAT PROVISION IS NEVER BEEN OPERATIONALIZED OR IMPLEMENTED. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A TOOL FOR ALLOWING THAT PROVISION TO BE TURNED INTO AN ACTUAL VIABLE OPTION FOR LOW SERVING ENTITIES THAT NEED ASSISTANCE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX TOPIC. AND THIS IS A BIG PICTURE CONCEPT. WE UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CHANGE THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSAL -- BUT WE THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR. TO HAVE A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS ON THE TABLE FOR DISCUSSION. BECAUSE THERE IS WIDE CONSENSUS THAT THERE IS NEED FOR SOME KIND OF A NEW BACKSTOPS TOOL IN THE STATE. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE. ONE WE'RE GONNA END UP HAVING TO CREATE ONE IN A HURRY UNDER DURESS AND OUR HOPE IS TO BE AHEAD OF THE CURVE IN THIS RESPECT. THANK YOU. THANKYOU AND BEFORE WE TAKE THE THE NEXT WITNESS AND I UNDERSTAND I APPRECIATE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERKS -- REPRESENTATION OF WHAT. WE BELIEVE THE AUTHOR IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT AS THE AMENDMENTS. BUT SINCE YOU ARE THE SPONSOR I WANT TO ASK YOU ARE MORE YOU SAY YOU'RE. COMFORTABLE WITH OF THE AND PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES. AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. WE ARE MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD SAY THAT WE'VE HAD NO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE AGENCY IDENTIFIED IN THE AMENDMENTS AS THE AS THE HOME FOR THIS NEW FUNCTION. AND SO WE HAVE DONE NO DUE DILIGENCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE ANY SHOWSTOPPER ISSUES WHETHER THE ENTITY IS INTERESTED IN TAKING ON THIS FUNCTION. SO -- WITH THOSE COPY YACHTS AND WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT OF ADDITIONAL WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE OTHER STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. THE ANSWER IS YES. RIGHT. I APPRECIATE THAT YEAH -- THANK YOU SHOULD I THINK THAT THE THE RELUCTANCE ON AT ON OUR PART IS JUST WE HAVEN'T WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS WERE JUST HOPING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE CALIFORNIA MATERNITY OF ENERGY AND EVENTS TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE TAKING THIS ON AND WHAT THAT PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW IT WOULD WORK I THINK THAT THAT'S A REAL. THE ONLY RELUCTANT YOU'RE HEARING HERE IT'S NOT A RELUCTANCE TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS RIGHT I KNOW AND I THINK WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO GET OUT WAS NO MATTER WHAT APPROACH I THINK YOU MADE IT CLEAR IN YOUR PRESENTATION THAT THIS IS A NEW APPROACH THAT WERE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME MODELS OF WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST THERE WERE SOME FLAWS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING -- NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT A COMPLETE START UP. WHERE THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ATTACHED TO THAT BUT TRY TO FIND A MODEL THAT -- HAD THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT. AND WE AND BROUGHT OUT IN A PRESS AND WE UNDERSTAND OKAY THANK YOU YEAH SO THAT WAS FOR CLARIFICATION -- SO WILL BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS THEN WE'LL COME BACK AND YOU CAN FINISH YOUR PRESENTATION AND THEN. SO DOCTOR EGGMAN WE WILL GET TO YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JEFF CIPHERS I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT NINETEEN LOCAL PUBLIC CCA'S IN CALIFORNIA SERVING TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND WE'RE WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND I WANT TO QUALIFY THAT LATER IN MY REMARKS BECAUSE ITS IMPORTS ARE YOUR AND OPPOSITION. TAKING OF THOSE IN FAVOR. UNDERSTOOD HOW WE WILL NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD BUT SO IF THERE. SO IS THERE ANYONE HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL. REMEMBER IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO EMAIL AND ASK ABOUT THE HALF THE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE. SINCE I WOULD BE THE SECOND -- WITNESS JUST MY TAKE ONE SECOND TO SAY WE CONCUR WITH THE TIME THE NEED FOR THE TIMING OF THIS BILL -- AND MOVING FORWARD BEFORE THERE IS A CRISIS A BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND IF THERE'S A LORD AS HE MINISTER SEMPRA ENERGY THERE'S IT ANYMORE -- OPPOSITION WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WITH AMENDMENTS WE PROVIDED SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND OUTLINED THOSE AMENDMENTS IN OUR LETTER AND HOPE THAT WE CAN. CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. APPRECIATE THE AND IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN BETWEEN. OKAY BUT I SEE SOME OTHER MOVEMENTS SO IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WHO IS PREPARED TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE. OKAY WE HAVE AN IN BETWEEN. BILLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE DID SUBMIT A COMMENT LETTER. OBVIOUSLY ANY CHANGES IN PROCUREMENT OUR KID KEEN INTEREST TO US ON BEHALF OF AGRICULTURAL RATE PAYERS IN THE STATE AND WE UNIFORMLY. PAY IN CALIFORNIA TWICE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY COSTS AS NEIGHBORING STATES SO WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THESE TYPES OF BILLS AS THEY MOVE FORWARD IN WILL BE INTERESTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VALERIE TERRELL OF LAJOS WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY WE ALSO SUBMITTED A COMMENT LETTER. DON'T HAVE A POSITION BUT WANTED TO ECHO QUICKLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID. THIS IS COMPLEX -- THERE'S BEEN SOME DEMONSTRATED NEED P. JEANNIE SUPPORT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE PC IN THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY SPACE. WE ARE OPEN -- TO CONTINUING THE ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND YOUR COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DANIEL MILLS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- WE ALSO HAVE NO POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT WE DID SUBMIT A LETTER -- CONSIDERATIONS THAT INCLUDED SOME PRINCIPLES FOR PROCUREMENT GOING FORWARD. JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS A VERY UNCERTAIN TIME FOR CALIFORNIA'S UTILITIES AND RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPERS WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS -- SEEKING TO FIT THIS INTO AN EXISTING -- STRUCTURE THAT MAY WORK AND WILLING TO EXPLORE THAT FURTHER -- AND WE DO WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROCEED WITH THIS CONVERSATION VERY CAREFULLY AND DON'T TAKE ANY STEPS THAT ARE GONNA. FURTHER COMPLICATE OF PROCUREMENT GOING FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME SHANNON IT IN WITH A LARGE SCALE SOLAR CESSATION WE ARE TWEETERS ON THIS -- ONE WORDS STILL DIGESTING THE IMPORT OF THE AMENDMENTS AND WHAT KIND OF IMPACT IF THAT'S GOING TO HELP ON THE LANGUAGE WHAT WE WILL SAY IS THAT -- CALIFORNIA'S OBVIOUSLY GOING UNDER OF MASSIVE TRANSITION RIGHT NOW AND WE WANT TO PROTECT AGAINST THE TENDENCY TO REACH TOO FAR OVER IN A COMMAND AND CONTROL STRUCTURES. IN THE NEVER TO TO ACHIEVE SOME STABILITY SO WE DO THINK THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR CENTRAL BACKSTOP ENTITY IF IT'S A LITTLE MORE SURGICAL -- WE LISTED SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE ELEMENTS ARE LETTER AND OUTLOOK FOR THE NEXT UP SOME TO WANT TO SEE THE BILL KEEP MOVING THANKS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TWENTY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION AND THE SAME TWEENER SECTION -- OUR LETTER DID HIGHLIGHT PRINCIPLES THAT WE THINK. CAN HELP INFORM THE DISCUSSION THANK OF THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SPACE AND WE AGREE THAT. DOING SOMETHING BEFORE THERE'S A CRISIS IS DEFINITELY NEEDED -- IN THE SPACE THANK YOU. RESEARCHER MEMBERS TRANSMIT ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE HAD SUBMITTED OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED LETTER I BELIEVE BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS WHERE YOU'RE NOW IN THE TWEENER SECTION UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE AMOUNT ABOUT SADDENED UP OR TAKE A LOOK AT HIM. THANK YOU. WHICH CHAIRING MEMBERS GREG COOK REPRESENTING ANOTHER CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ACCEPTED TODAY WE WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOUR STAFF IN THE AUTHOR FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER AUTHORITY AGAIN APPRECIATE -- THE CHAIRS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND AUTHORS AND STAFFS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THEM AND WITH THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THEM IN THEIR FORMING THE NEXT COMMITTEE [inaudible] THANK YOU -- NO OTHER. INBETWEENERS [inaudible] OKAY. WE'LL ACCEPT YOUR TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE OPPONENTS POLICIES FOR JUMPING THE GUN EARLIER. SO -- JOB CIPHERS WITH KELSEY CA -- WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION WE DO THINK THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO SOLVE A REAL PROBLEM -- BUT AS WRITTEN WE BELIEVE IT WOULD MAKE MATTERS WORSE -- WE DO NEED TO PROTECT GRADE RELIABILITY -- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO DO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HURT A RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. SO I'D LIKE TO REMEMBER THAT CCA'S WERE CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE MARKET STABILITY DURING PEAK GINNY'S FIRST BANKRUPTCY. AND BACK THEN GAMING BY SOME ENERGY CORPORATIONS CONTRIBUTED THE BLACKOUTS AND HIGH RATES. WE NOW HAVE OPERATING CCA'S AND THEIR STRONG INTEREST IN STOCKTON AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIAN HAD EXPAND CCA RATE PAYER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS TO INCLUDE EVERYONE. THE THE CURRENT BILL WOULD HAVE A CENTRAL BUYER HANDLE RESOURCE ADEQUACY RENEWABLE ENERGY AND EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS -- BUT LET'S CHECK THAT ON RENEWABLE ENERGY THE CCA'S ARE CONTRACTING TO BUILD RESOURCES AT A RECORD HIGH RATE -- WE'VE ALREADY FINANCE TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS WE EXPECT TO FINANCE A THOUSAND MORE MEGAWATTS THIS YEAR ALONE AND WE PLAN TO BUILD TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS BY. TWENTY THIRTY THE I. O. U.'S HAVE NO NEED TO BUILD NEW RESOURCES BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE VOTING TO FORM MORE CCA'S. ON RENEWABLE AT RESOURCE ADEQUACY OR ARE A THAT MATTER IS DIFFERENT IN A BILL THAT FOCUSES SOLELY ON OUR A WOULD ACTUALLY BE WELCOME TO US. IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO ENSURE THE CONSTRUCTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ISN'T ACCIDENTALLY STOPPED BECAUSE CC IS ARE DEVELOPING THOSE TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. FOR BOTH ENERGY AND RELIABILITY THOSE TWO FACETS OF A PROJECT ALWAYS GO TOGETHER -- AND ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR RENEWABLE INTEGRATION. SO ANY HARM TO OR TAKING AWAY POWERS FOR RESEARCH ADEQUACY COULD ARMOR ABILITY TO BUILD NEW ENERGY SOURCES. SO WE ARE REACHING OUT TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK -- TO CREATE A DEFAULT PROCUREMENT ENTITY FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY ALONE. IT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS ARE COORDINATED BETWEEN ENERGY COMMISSION THE I SO IN THE PC. AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW ELECTRIC PROVIDERS TO BUY RESOURCES AS THEY DO NOW THE BILL ISN'T AS CLEAR ON THAT POINT AS WE WOULD LIKE. THEN AFTER THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES HAVE PROCURED THE DEFAULT BUYER WITHIN STEP IN AND BY ANY REMAINING NEEDED RESOURCES AND ASSIGN THE COSTS IN THAT BACKSTOP MANNER TO ANYONE WHO DIDN'T PARK HERE. AND IT WOULD THOSE COSTS WOULD FLOW TO THE GENERATION SIDE OF THE BILL THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE WE'D LIKE TO SEE. GOOD BACKSTOPS ARGUMENT LIKE THIS WILL PROTECT OUR GRID WITHOUT HURTING RATE PAYERS ENERGY JOBS OF THE CLIMATE AND WE'RE READY TO HELP DRAFT OUT BILL. AND LOOK FORWARD TO IT. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHERS HERE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. JUST LENDING YOUR YOUR NAME FILIATION AND APPOSITION. ADAM SMITH WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FIFTY SIX AS IT'S WRITTEN WE THINK THAT THE BILL I THAT DOES IDENTIFY A CRITICAL PROBLEM WHICH IS THE LACK OF CENTRALIZED PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT OVERSIGHT OVER SOME LOADS SERVING ENTITIES. WE THINK AB FIFTY SIX PROPOSES THE WRONG SOLUTION THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JASON I OCCURRED -- WITH THAT'LL STEAM GILBERT ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF CLEAN POWER SF ALSO IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU. I SEE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION OR NO FURTHER COMMENTS -- WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK. SO THE CHAIR INDICATED AND I WOULD AGREE WITH HIM THAT WE NEED A VEHICLE GOING FORWARD TO DISCUSS THIS PROBLEM. REGARDLESS OF WHAT. I MEAN I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT TOO BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE THE VEHICLE GOING TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION GOING WHICH WAS ALSO MENTIONED BY THE SPONSOR. OF FOR THAT REASON I'LL NOW MOVED TO BAIL. IS OUR SECOND. THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING. YOUR I GUESS I GET IT I'M ON THE COMMITTEE I CAN'T -- JUST THEN THE COMMENT ON THE BALLOT. FIRST OF ALL WE DO I'D LIKE TO ASK THE SPONSOR QUESTION SO WE DO HAVE A BACKSTOP NOW. AND THAT IS THE I SO CAN SAY THIS PLANT MáS RYAN -- SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A CONTRACT IN ONE CASE AT LEAST THEY HAS THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO MAKE CONTRACT -- SO ITS RELIABILITY MUST RUN -- AND FRANKLY I TRUST THE ISO MORE TO MAKE THAT DECISION IN THE C. P. U. C. WHICH IS WHAT'S IN HERE. THE I SO HAS FAR BETTER MODELS WE SEEN THE CPUC CHANGE THE I SO REQUIREMENTS. FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY WHICH MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL BECAUSE THEY KNOW A LOT LESS THE AYE IT SO DOES. SO MY FIRST COMMENT IS WE SHOULDN'T BE RELYING ON THE C. P. U. C. TO THE SIDE RESOURCE ADEQUACY THAT OUGHT TO BE -- THE I. S. SHOW -- SECOND -- THERE NOW THERE IS A PROCEDURE. AND I THINK WITH OUR I BELIEVE THIS THE I SO PERHAPS THE CHAIR CAN CORRECT ME IF I DON'T HAVE THIS I BELIEVE THE I SO IS NOW STARTING TO LOOK OUT. AT ALL A LARGER HORIZON. MARY CANCER THAT [inaudible] ITSELF. NOT BEING FOCUSED ON WELL CERTAINLY. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON A LARGE HORIZON WE DO KNOW. THAT UNDER THE LAST RESOURCE ADEQUACY. LOOK BY THE R. C. P. YOU SEE THAT -- THERE WASN'T RESOURCE ADEQUACY -- AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TELL THE CCA'S TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAT'S NOT. WE HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM THAT AUTHORITY -- AND I WOULD ASK THE C. C. A.'S -- TWO I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO HERE IS TO ASK THE C. C. A.'S. ARE FOR THEM TO WORK TOGETHER -- ON THIS ISSUE -- WHEN WE HAD? YOU KNOW ONE UTILITY IN CHARGE OF A LARGE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA WE COULD JUST DEPEND UPON THE UTILITY. I THINK NOW THAT WE GOING HAVE -- CCA IS AND IN THE SAME TERRITORY AS I USE -- AND JUST THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT -- I WOULD ASK THEM TO ADD TO WORK. WITH THE I. AT I USE AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO COVER PARTICULAR REGIONS -- AND THEN FINALLY -- WE DO HAVE A PROCESS AND I'M NOT SURE IT'S BROKEN BUT I DO THINK THAT THE CCA'S HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND HERE THEY SORT OF CUT OUT I WANT THEM TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND I KNOW THAT THEY WANT -- TO TO GET THE PROPER BALANCE ON THE GRAD. SO -- THAT THAT'S MY COMMENT I'M STILL SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I THINK -- I HOPE THAT -- WELL WE CAN KEEP THE COMMAS AND PERIODS THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST A A SHORT RESPONSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- CURRENTLY THE PC DOES HAVE PRIMARY JURISDICTION OVER RESOURCE ADEQUACY OVERSIGHT AND COMPLIANCE BY LOAD SERVING ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA -- TO MOVE THAT PROGRAM ENTIRELY AS TO THE ISO WOULD BE A PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THIS BILL DOESN'T DISTURB THE CURRENT. SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO A JURISDICTION AND AUTHORITY -- AND UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE DEFICITS IDENTIFIED THE PC HAS THE AUTHORITY AND HAS IN FACT USE THAT AUTHORITY TO DIRECT THE I USED TO GO OUT AND DO LONG TERM CONTRACTS FOR BRAND NEW RESOURCES SAID THAT'S KIND OF THE DEFAULT. THAT WE'RE THE WORLD WE'RE LIVING IN TODAY YES BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS FOLLOW THE I SO DIRECTION. AND SO I DON'T TRUST WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THE I. SL KNOWS THEIR MUCH THE MODELS THAT THEY HAVE THIS TO PETE CPUC ARE INFERIOR AND YET THEY WILL CHANGE WHAT THE ISO RECOMMEND SO THAT'S A PROBLEM. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT TAKEN CARE OF BUT THE OTHER THING IS. I MEAN WE REALLY HAVE. TO I WAS NEVER IN FAVOR OF HAVING CCA'S BUT NOW THAT THEY'RE HERE. I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT. THEM TOGETHER WITH ALL THE LOAD SERVING ENERGIESIN THE REGION AND TO WORK THESE THINGS OUT TOGETHER BEFORE WE HAVE GOVERNMENT -- SAME THIS OR THAT I THINK THE I SO IS REALLY THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN TELL US. WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND I THINK THEN WE SHOULD RELY ON THE CCA'S TO WORK WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. AND TO GET A GOVERNMENT AGENCY INVOLVED. I'M NOT REALLY QUITE READY FOR THAT BUT WE DO NEED TO DISCUSS IT JUST TO CLARIFY THIS BILL DOES NOT I'M SORRY. WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA YEAH YEAH OF THE PERSON. ADDRESSED HER UP. ONE AT A LINE OF MY CONCERNS WITH THE MIST QUIRK -- WANT TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING HERE FROM AN FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON THE PLANET [inaudible] WE ARE. ALMOST TWENTY YEARS INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS UNCERTAIN WHAT ITS ELECTRICITY GRID IS GONNA LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD LOOK WHERE WE ARE. WE ARE ESSENTIALLY I THINK SLOWLY. DISINTEGRATING THE GRADE THAT WE HAVE HAD SERVE US WELL FOR A LONG LONG TIME. AND I RECOGNIZE. THE NECESSITY TO AT LEAST HAVE THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT THE P. YOU SEE DOES NOT. HAVE THE FAVOR I THINK OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT TO THAT KIND OF DECISION ON ON AYE AYE -- APPRECIATE THE DOCTOR QUIRKS. COMMENT ON THIS. I THINK MY OVERARCHING CONCERN IS THAT THIS. I DON'T THINK IS READY FOR PRIME TIME JUST YET. I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THERE'S GOT TO BE A SERIOUS -- PLANNING -- OVER THE NEXT PERIOD OF TIME HERE -- AS I SAID I MEAN WITH THIS THAT TWENTY YEARS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY OUT WE WE HAVE A HUGE ECONOMY. TO ENERGIZE KEEP ENERGIZED AND TO HAVE IT RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE. THE SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE SEEN RELIABILITY GO DOWN AND IF AT AT AT AT AND OF AND AFFORDABILITY GO DOWN. AT AS A RESULT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE. I'M I'M PREPARED AND I THINK THIS COMMITTEES PREPARED TO LOOK AT WHAT THAT NEXT -- GRADE LOOKS LIKE. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE. CAREFUL MORE CAREFUL. A LITTLE BIT SLOWER. AND HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS -- AND I WOULD JUST SAY WHAT TROUBLES ME THE MOST IS THIS FEELS LIKE. THAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO END WITH IS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT IS DICTATORIAL AND THAT CAN COMMAND. AND WHEN THAT COMMAND IS -- DONE IT WILL BE THE RATE PAYERS THAT WILL. BE FORCED TO TO PAY FOR THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AS WELL SO FOR THOSE REASONS I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THIS -- CONVERSATION AND WE DO NEED A A A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY GRID SOLUTION BUT I THINK THAT TAKES. DEEP THINKING ALL PARTIES AT THE TABLE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS SPACE ON WINNERS IN. OPPOSITION AND NOT AND ON OTHER SITES I THINK ARGUES FOR THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION SO I'M GONNA. LAY OFF THE BILL -- I DO THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE MUCH MORE WORK ON IT AND I'M GOING TO RESERVE MY FINAL VOTE FOR THE FLOOR. THROUGH THE CHAIR THE CHAIR CAN I YES -- I JUST LIKE TO DRESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON I AGREE -- WE SHOULDN'T BE HERE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PREPARED BUT THE REALITY IS WITH THE SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN WE DO HAVE -- I USE THAT ARE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY WE DO HAVE -- RELIABILITY ISSUES ON THE BRINK AND THE REALITY IS IS WE HAVE TO WE ARE FOR WE HAVE. PUT OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WE ARE FORCED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION NOW. WE NEED A BACKSTOP WE DO NOT HAVE AN OPTION AND I THINK. AN OPPOSITE I SEE WHAT YOU HOW YOU SEE THESE POINTERS AS OPPOSITE YES IT IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. AND YES IT IS TAKING A LOT OF TIME EVEN JUST TO GET HERE BUT AS YOU SEE PEOPLE MOVING FROM OPPOSITION IN THIS LONG LINE OF TRAINERS THAT IS A SHOW OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THAT THE AUTHOR IS WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. THAT WE ARE MOVING THE NEEDLE ON WHERE THEY SHOULD GO IN NARROWING IT SO THAT IT IS NOT DICTATORIAL SO THAT IT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO BE WHICH IS A BACKSTOPS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A LARGE ENOUGH PLACE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY. FOR CARE AND NOT FOR TO REDUCE THE RATES FOR FOLKS SO I THINK THAT THE INTENTION AND THE MOON. DIRECTION IN WHICH THIS BILL IS MOVING IN IS IS CORRECT AND AND UNFORTUNATELY I WISH WE HAD TEN YEARS TO DEAL WITH THIS. BUT WE DON'T WE HAVE PLACED OURSELVES ANY SITUATION WITH THE I. YOU USE IN THE WAY THAT WE DID TO ARE THOSE WHO DESIGNED THE SYSTEM BEFORE US. DID. AND SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS I THINK WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS EVERYBODY IN THIS LINE EVEN THE OPPOSITION HAS SAID ONE THING. THAT THEY KNOW THAT THIS A SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE FOUND AND THAT THIS IS IN THE SCOPE OF THE SOLUTION NOT PERFECT. NEEDS WORK NEEDS TO BE WORKED WITH WITH THE CCA'S BUT MOST DEFINITELY PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT NEEDS TO BE FOUND AT LEAST A PORTION OF IT. AND I THINK ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT HAS STOOD UP FOR SPOKEN TODAY HAS SAID SOME VERSION OF THAT EXCEPT FOR I THINK TWO HUNDRED TWO THE I SO IS NOT IDENTIFIED THE SYSTEM DEFICIENCY SO. THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE CPC ALSO RECENTLY ACCEPTED OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR A THREE YEAR OBLIGATION PRETTY RECENTLY IS ONLY A ONE YEAR OBLIGATION FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY. AND SO I THINK WE'RE MOVING ON THE RIGHT TRACK [inaudible] DR. WHAT I AND I I DO REALLY I DO APPRECIATE THIS I REALLY DO? I'M NOT SAYING WE HAVE TEN YEARS OUT I THINK THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY. PROBABLY AS A TWO OR THREE YEAR. SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES I KNOW THAT WE OFTENTIMES IN THE MIDST OF CRISIS WE SAY WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WE DO THE RIGHT THING I DO THINK THERE ARE INCOMPLETE PIECES IN HERE AND WE HAVE EXPRESSED SOME OF THOSE. INCOMPLETE PIECES AND THAT'S WHY PRESENTLY I'M GONNA LAY OFF APPRECIATE THE THE CONVERSATION I REALLY DO. YEAH WELL I THINK WE ALSO MY BROKEN RECORDS I THINK WE ALL SHARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS I ALSO THINK THAT I A SO IS THE BETTER A BODY. I GET TIRED OF US GIVING MORE TO THE C. P. U. C. TO DO AND THEN BRING THEM IN HERE BEATING THEM UP NOT DOING. EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO AND WE JUST PILE ON SOME MORE IS THAT THAT IS COUNTER INTUITIVE DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE -- AND I REPRESENT AG DISTRICT AND THERE WHEN WE USED TO HAVE A TON OF PROCESSING WE DON'T HAVE ANYMORE BECAUSE THE COST OF ENERGY IS IS TO PRICES PEOPLE OUT I MEAN WE MUST ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF COST. AND RELIABILITY -- AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S TOO BAD I THINK AUTHORS NOT HERE AND AND SOME MEMBER BURKE IS IN A FANTASTIC JOB OF STEPPING UP AND STEPPING IN -- BUT THE SPACE IT NEEDS I MEAN THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN DO QUICKLY I FIND MYSELF ALIGNING MYSELF WITH MR PATERSON SAYING BUT SOME WE NEED TO MOVE BUT SOMETIMES MOVING TOO QUICKLY. IS AS BAD AS NOT MOVING AT ALL -- SO I THINK WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT AND GO TO NATURAL RESOURCES NEXUS AT WHERE IT WILL GO ALRIGHT. SO I WILL BE ORDERING IT THERE. SUMMER SEARCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT -- TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONCERN THAT ICE IS C. AND THE CAL CCA LETTER THAT. TO WHILE THIS IS BEING PRESENTED AS FOR A BACKSTOP THAT THE LESS THAN GRANT OF AUTHORITY IS BROAD ENOUGH THAT THERE'S CONCERN AT LEAST THAT THE AUTHORITY COULD BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE. REGARDING PROCUREMENT AND SO YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS A LARGE -- PARTS OF IT THAT -- ARE COMING UNDER THIS -- EXCITING TO NEW CLEAN POWER ALLIANCE -- A PROJECT AND I I THINK -- YOU KNOW RATHER THAN. VOTING ON YOU KNOW A PROJECT IN ITS WORKS I YOU KNOW. I CANNOT SUPPORT WHAT IS BEFORE US HERE TODAY AND SO I WILL NOT BE PUTTING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OKAY WE HAVE -- OKAY THIS CREEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO GIVE A THANK YOU TO MISS BURKE FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY. TO TO PRESENT ON A COLLEAGUES BILL BUT I'M SURE MR GARCIA'S VERY APPRECIATIVE TO YOUR WORK -- AND TO ALL OF US HERE LET US JUST REMEMBER THAT IF THE AUTHOR WERE HERE HE'D BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS HIMSELF. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AND AGAIN THANK YOU. I WAS BURKE THIS IS A YEAH. BUT BUT YOU YOU UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT I DID THINK. COMPLETELY HOLD WATER YOU'RE A VERY COMFORTABLE PLACE -- AND AND I THINK THAT THE RECOMMENDATION -- THAT WERE MAKING IS TO KEEP THE BILL MOVING ALONG WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A COMPLICATED A SUBJECT -- AND BUT WHAT IS A COMPLICATED IN THIS -- IN THIS PARTICULAR LINE. OF BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL AND WE DID GET A SIGNAL FROM THE PC PRESIDENT AND ARE. A HEARING ABOUT A MONTH OR TWO AGO WHERE HE INDICATED THAT. MOVING TO SOME TYPE OF A BACKSTOP OR CENTRAL PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY WAS GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN AT SOME POINT SO I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION IN THE MARKET PLACES TO SUGGEST THAT. WE ARE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES HAVING TO GET TO THIS PLACE. AND SO IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE'S RESPONSIBILITY SORT OF GET THEIR ARMS AROUND THIS ISSUE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO PROPOSED BACK AT LEAST TO A PROCESSOR SYSTEM THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE -- TO GET US INTO THE AREA GET US INTO THE CONVERSATION TO ALLOW US TO LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF A STRUCTURE THAT WOULD AT LEAST. A COMPLIMENT -- THE END GOAL BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WE WEREN'T MOVING TOO FAST WITH TWO NEW OF A PROCESS TO NEW OF A STRUCTURE THAT. REQUIRED START UP IN OF A LOT OF OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WE WERE COMPARED PREPARED AT THIS POINT. TO OPINE ON IN IN GREATER DETAIL -- BUT WE DO THINK THAT THIS -- PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE -- ALLOWS FOR THE CONVERSATION AND I THINK WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS YOU POINTED OUT WE WERE ABLE TO SORT OF SHRINK THE UNIVERSE OF OPPOSITION -- THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL ALONG. TO A NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE AT THAT POINT -- WE ARE -- THIS IS A DO PLACE ENJOYS A DO PASS TO NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE AMENDMENTS. THAT ARE PROPOSING THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE TAKEN IN NATURAL RESOURCES. WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS AT THIS POINT -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. NOT JUST NOT WITH THE OFFER BUT WITH MYSELF AS A TAKE ON A BILL THAT IS NOT MINE BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE PUT INTO THIS AND THANK YOU TO THE TO THE OTHER MEMBERS FOR TAKING THIS. SERIOUSLY I UNDERSTAND IT IS COMPLICATED I UNDERSTAND IT IS IMPORTANT -- BUT AS I KNOW THAT'S AUTHOR HE WILL WORK VERY VERY HARD WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS MOVING FORWARD. THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I THINK THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT I MEAN CERTAINLY. FAMILY -- SITUATION HAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US TODAY BUT HE WILL BE BACK AT HIS AS WE KNOW A VERY ENGAGED AND AND AND VERY COLLABORATIVE AUTHOR SO -- WE HAVE A MOTION -- DO PASSES -- MENTION TO WITH THE MINISTRY TAKEN AND NATURAL RESOURCES. CALDERON. HOLDEN HI HOLDEN AYE PATTERSON LOADING. BURKE I BURKE I DO. RELY CHEN [inaudible] AND VOTING [inaudible] CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO. EGGMAN. EGGMAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I NAZARIAN MAYES. MAYES I MURATSUCHI [inaudible] AND VOTING. QUIRK ALRIGHT. HI REYES [inaudible] SANTIAGO TEAM. THE BILL HAS SEVEN VOTE SO WE NEED ONE MORE SO IT'S ON CALL. SENATOR AND WELCOME. AND IN ITS WALKED IN SO WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU AT A AT A LATER TIME. I SO IT IS ON CALL WE ARE ONE VOTE SHY DO YOU WANT ME TO GO FOR THE NEXT. YES. YOUR AT IT LET'S LET'S DO THAT. THANK YOU MISTER LIVING. NO ONE WAITING WHEN I WENT OVER. THIS IS -- YOUR PRESENT A MISTER LIVING AYE WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT I GOT A POLICY YEAH WELL I KNOW WE WHEN WE DISPENSE OF MR LEVINE YOURS COMES AFTER IN THE FILE ORDER SO WILL -- TAKE A. B.. TWELVE NINETY THREE AND THIS ENJOY TO DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND THE AUTHORS AGREED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. I I'M SURE. MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU -- THANKYOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS YOU ARE LONG FROM DONE WITH ME -- I'LL BE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO ADD AGRICULTURE CUSTOMERS TO THE RATE IMPACT ANALYSIS THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE. A CALIFORNIA WE THE NATION IN CLEAN ENERGY REALIZATION AND TACKLING THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AVERAGE WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THE SAME AS IN TEXAS AND I THE U. S. AVERAGE HOWEVER THE STATE'S ELECTRICITY RATES ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. AND ROUGHLY TWICE AS HIGH AS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS JUST FOR THE DISPARITY IN CALIFORNIA IN RATES IN CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY. OF COVERS NUMEROUS ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN MANDATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN ADDITION TO STANDARD FIXED COSTS LIKE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTED TO BE SOME LINES IN THE YEARS SINCE THE STATE'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS. INTEREST HAS GROWN IN THE UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF MANDATED PROGRAMS ON REPAIRS TO THAT END IN RECENT YEARS THE P. YOU SEE HAS ANNUALLY PUBLISHED ACTIONS TO LIMIT UTILITY COSTS AND RATE. AB TWELVE NINETY THREE AS ANOTHER INFORMATIONAL TOOL FOR THE EFFORT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND REPAIR COSTS WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IT'S CALIFORNIA MOVES TOWARDS MUCH GREATER ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES AND HOMES. ELECTRICITY RATES THAT ARE TOO HIGH COULD IMPEDE THIS AMBITIOUS A LOT OF LOCAL. HAVING THE MORE PRECISE RATE IMPACT INFORMATION THAT THIS BILL WOULD HELP PROVIDE WILL HELP POLICY MAKERS BETTER ASSESS AND DETERMINE THE BEST POWER PATH FORWARD OF CALIFORNIANS CONTINUED TO INCREASE ITS EXPANDABILITY EFFORTS. WITH ME THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS. THAT I'M PROBABLY GONNA NEED. OKAY WELL IF THE START TO YOUR RIDE AND WILL -- TAKE LESS MONEY MISTER CHAIR CAN'T COUNT ON BEHALF OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC AND SO CAL GAS WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SECOND RATE REFORM CHANGES SINCE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE WERE ABLE TO GET AB THREE TWENTY SEVEN APPROVED WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED. RATES ARE CONCERNED OUR RATES IN SAN DIEGO ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE STATE. LAST YEAR IN WORKING WITH SOME REMEMBER BURKE AND OTHERS -- BUT WE DID A REVIEW OF WHAT THE OF MANDATED PROGRAM COSTS WERE WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. AND WE ESTIMATED NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OUT OF REVENUE OF JUST OVER FOUR BILLION SO IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF OUR REVENUE THAT COMES IN. IF YOU PUT THAT IN CONTEXT ON WHILE FOR MITIGATION WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MITIGATION EFFORTS FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOW AND WE'VE SPENT JUST OVER ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. SO THE MANDATED PROGRAMS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR OF OUR RATES WERE ALSO WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE ON TEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH THIS COMMITTEE WILL HERE IN A COUPLE WEEKS. AND THAT SEEKS TO TAKEN EARLIER LOOK AT IT BEFORE THE COMMITTEES DECIDE MOVING FORWARD ON A BILL TO IDENTIFY. IN A HOLISTIC WAY MOST BILLS THAT WE IN THE UTILITY INDUSTRY WORK ON ARE A MATTER OF COST IMPLICATIONS BETWEEN ONE GREAT PAIR CLASS FIRST ANOTHER. AND WE THINK THESE THIS FOCUS ON WHAT THOSE IMPACTS ARE ON REPAIRS IS IMPORTANT AND THEREFORE WE SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF TURN IN SUPPORT -- WE LIKE THE FACT THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO INCLUDE THE COST OF THESE MANDATED PROGRAMS ON A PER THERM OR PER KILOWATT HOUR BASIS. IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND AS AN ATTACHMENT TO EACH AGENDA TO A PC BUSINESS MEETING. I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THE IS THE PC TENDS TO LOOK AT EACH PROPOSED SPENDING ITEM ON ITS AGENDA IN COMPLETE ISOLATION. AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER CUMULATIVE INCREASES THAT THEY HAD TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. IT BEGINS TO FEEL A LOT LIKE FREE MONEY -- WITH NO HARD TRADE OFFS THAT NEED TO BE MADE WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS A VERY SMALL. BUT MEANINGFUL STEP. TOWARDS FORCING THE REGULATORS TO GRAPPLE WITH THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OF ALL OF THE CHOICES THAT ARE BEING MADE BOTH BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE CHOICES THAT THEY HAVE BEFORE THEM AT A BUSINESS MEETING -- WE DO HAVE A CRISIS OF AFFORDABILITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE RECORD NUMBERS OF SHOT OFTEN PEOPLE BEHIND ON BILL PAYMENT -- AND WE NEED TO GET THE REGULATORS TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON THE FACT THAT EVERY TIME THEY APPROVE AN ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASE THERE ARE REAL CONSEQUENCES -- AND WHEN YOU ADD THEM TO ALL OF THE MANDATED PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE -- THAT ADDS UP TO REAL MONEY THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE -- TO I ADD ON TO THIS SO SUPPORT YES AT BEST A LOSS SO ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE SUPPORTIVE AMENDED -- OBVIOUSLY THE ADDITION OF THE I. GRATES A BRINGS US INTO FULL SUPPORT SO WE THINK THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THAT AND LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING THE BILL NEXT COMMITTEE. YES OVER THERE IN CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE WERE ALSO SPUR OF AMENDED AND APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS AND RENOUNCE PARTS THANK YOU BURGER THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. IT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SAYING NO OPPOSITION DUCTWORK -- SO I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL. AND YOU'LL BE SURE OF THAT. EVEN THOUGH I LAST LOTS OF QUESTIONS -- ONE IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING. LOOKING AT SECTION NINE THIRTEEN LIFE. LET THE STAFF KNOW THAT I HAVE A CONCERN HERE. IT SAYS THAT YOU LOOK AT EACH PROGRAM MANDATE MANDATED BY STATUTE AND ITS ANNUAL COSTS TO RATEPAYERS THAT'S PARAGRAPH. ONE PARAGRAPH TO IS EACH PROGRAM MANDATED BY THE COMMISSION ITS ANNUAL COST TO TRACK TO TAXPAYERS. BUT THEN AND BELOW IT JUST SAYS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH ONE I THINK YOU WANT PARAGRAPHS ONE AND TWO IS THAT CORRECT OR NOT. OKAY THAT'S PROBABLY CORRECT. THE OTHER PART. IS I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU DIVIDE UP. LET'S JUST TAKE THE LAST THE FIRST BILL WE HEARD FRIEDMAN SPELL. OUT SAYING THE COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE A GRID. AND THAT TAKES ES DE UP MONEY AND SET IT UP FOR COMMUNITY. NOW I COMMUNITY WHEN YOU FIRST START OUT COULD HAVE NO COMMERCIAL AND THEN A WEEK LATER COMMERCIAL COMES IN AND THEN MAYBE AN INDUSTRY COMES IN. AND MAYBE THERE'S MORE FAR MEAN IT'S HARD TO SAY HOW WHEN YOU HELP A WHOLE COMMUNITY IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED UP. LET'S TAKE -- THE PROGRAM ON BATTERY PROCUREMENT. SOME OF THAT WILL BE IN HOMES AND I GUESS THAT YOU COULD SAY IS RESIDENTIAL SOME OF THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE BY INDUSTRY. BUT OTHERS JUST PEOPLE OUT THERE SELLING -- BATTERIES ARE POWER TO INDUSTRY OR HOMES OR WHATEVER SO THAT THEY CAN DISPLACE THE LOAD WHEN THEY HAVE TO PAY THE HIGHER LOAD. SO HOW YOU KNOW IT MAY BE DIVIDED UP A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS. THERE'S ALL SORTS OF PROGRAMS THAT I THINK YOU'D HAVE A HARD TIME DIVIDING UP INTO THESE FOUR PARTS. AND YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF JUST SAYING WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE COST OF PROGRAMS. AND THEN AFTER THE FACT MAYBE MAKE AN ANALYSIS OF HOW MUCH WENT TO EACH BUT I'M JUST QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN DO AN ACCURATE. DIVISION I THINK YOU CAN GET A NUMBER FOR EACH PROGRAM AND YOU CAN HAVE AN IDEA. BUT TO ASK FOR ACCURACY I I DON'T THINK YOU CAN QUITE GET THERE. YET JUST IN RESPONSE TO THAT AS PART OF OUR GENERATE CASES IN FACE TO THE COMMISSION DECIDES WHAT PORTION OF THE TOTAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT GETS ASSIGNED TO COMMERCIAL CLASS AG CLASS RESIDENTIAL CLASS. AND THOUGH THAT'S HOW WOULD BE FIGURED OUT AMONGST THE DIFFERENT RATE CLASSES AS PART OF OUR HIZO FOR S. YET THEY'LL MAKE SOME SORT OF AN ARBITRARY I DON'T HOW WORK SPECIFIC CHANGE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT ESCAPE HAS ITS OWN REVENUE REQUIREMENT ATTACHED TO IT THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT IS -- MOVED INTO THE RATE STRUCTURE THROUGH -- REVENUE ALLOCATION PROCESS AND IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE WHEN YOU HAVE A STRAIGHT UP REVENUE REQUIREMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON A CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR BASIS OR CENTS PER THERM BASIS FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS. I THINK THE HARDER CASE THAT YOU MIGHT BE POINTING AT OUR PROGRAMS THAT DON'T HAVE AN EXPLICIT REVENUE REQUIREMENT ATTACHED TO THEM MOVING SO A MANDATE WHERE PROCUREMENT HAPPENS AND THE QUESTION BECOMES WELL HOW MUCH DID THAT COST. AND REALLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WHAT IS THE ABOVE MARKET COST WHAT'S THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT. AND I THINK MAYBE IF THE COMMISSION CAN'T ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT RAISES SOME INTERESTING AVENUES FOR FURTHER WORK BY THE COMMISSION TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THEY ESTABLISH THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES ALRIGHT WELL PERHAPS IF THERE COULD BE SOME LANGUAGE TO JUST -- RECOGNIZED THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ASK THEM TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE BUT TO GET THEIR BEST ESTIMATE. THANK YOU. OKAY AND WE'RE WORKING WITH AND WHAT THE AUTHOR IS WORKING WITH THE PC I'M ON THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT INFORMATION WILL BE COLLECTED. SO THAT IT WON'T BE OPPOSED TO ANYTHING THAT NOTHING THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE OR LIKE THAT WILL BE IMPOSED ON THEM [inaudible] GARCIA -- AND I'LL BE WAITING FOR THE BILL TODAY AND IT'S OR TALKING ABOUT. THINGS THAT ARE POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY OUT THERE BUT I I DO HAVE CONCERNS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT COST AND AND BENEFITS -- WHEN WE DRAW SOME OF THESE HARD LINES THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS -- AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND SO FORTH THAT SOMETIMES. WE DON'T TAKE INTO THAT ANALYSIS AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE DOING. THIS. REPORT WHICH I THINK EFFECTIVE RIGHT THING TO DO I APPRECIATED THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY SAID DIFFERENT TYPES OF HUMAN COST AND IF IT'S ALONG THE WAY AS WELL. AND I WOULD GO THROUGH THE CHAIR AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THAT THIS REPORT IN THE THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON I'M SO THAT WE CAN KIND OF GET TO AN ANALYSIS OF WHY OUR RATES ARE WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT WE CAN. WHAT WE CAN DO TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE THE ISSUES WERE HAVING WITH OUR RATES IT'S JUST FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE OF US -- WOULD NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS AND SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL BELL BENEFITS THAT COME WITH A LOT OF PROGRAMS WE PUT TOGETHER. I THINK AT THIS POINT THOUGH IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY WITH ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL -- SITUATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLY GOING TO IMPOSE. WAIT ON OUR RANGE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT THOSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING BOTH WELL EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING OUR MANDATES. I AGREE WITH YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. OKAY WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND THE MOTION IS -- DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR -- GRAIN TO THE AMENDMENTS. SO THERE ANOTHER QUESTION SO WILL CALL THE ROLL ON THE MOTION. HOLDEN HI HOLDEN AYE PATTERSON. BURKE HI BURKE I CARILLO. CARILLO ON MY CHIN. GEN I CUNNINGHAM [inaudible] EGGMAN.

WITH THE MEMBERS TO BE TAKEN AND NATURAL RESOURCE. YOU JUST NEED A YES FOR ME. WE NEED A NEW MOTION. GIVE ME JUST A SECOND YEAH YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT WE'RE GONNA WE STILL HAVE SOME WORK TO FINISH OUT ON NO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT. THE NEXT ACTUALLY TAKE IS CORRECT SO WE JUST. LET THEM FIGURE THAT OUT IN THE MEANTIME WE WILL TURN TO YOU -- AND WE WILL. THE BILL IS AB NINE SIXTY WERE -- ONE THIS ENJOYS A DO PASSES A MINUTE TO APPROPRIATIONS AND YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE TAKEN UP IN APPROPRIATIONS [inaudible] YES OKAY. MANY OF THEM. THERE YOU GO PLEASE PERCENT. AND I DO WANT [inaudible] TO GEN REPORTER. GOV AB. NINE SIXTY ONE REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH COMMON DEFINITIONS FOR COMMUNITY NON ENERGY BENEFITS THESE BENEFITS WOULD INCORPORATE A CONSIDERATION OF SOCIETAL. AND SOCIAL COSTS WHEN LOOKING TO DEPLOY CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. THIS BILL STEMS FROM A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE SB THREE FIFTY BARRIER STUDY. RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHICH HAD A RECOMMENDATION TO ESTABLISH COMMON DEFINITIONS OF NON ENERGY BENEFITS DEVELOP STANDARDS TO MEASURE THEM AND ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE CONSISTENT VALUES. UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIESFACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE AVERAGE ENERGY COST BURDEN FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WAS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. IN ADDITION DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SUFFER BOTH ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES BECAUSE THEY ARE LOCATED IN AREAS WITH CONCENTRATED SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION. CURRENT COST EFFECTIVENESS TEST DO NOT CONSISTENTLY CONSIDER THESE AND OTHER NON ENERGY BENEFITS AND THIS BILL DIRECTS THE BROADER APPLICATION. TO PROGRAMS SUCH AS THOSE DEPLOYING DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. BY MEANINGFULLY CONSIDERING AND PRIORITIZING NON ENERGY BENEFITS THIS BILL CREATES A FOUNDATION TO IMPLEMENT THE MOST HOLISTIC INEFFECTIVE CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS POSSIBLE. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THIS ISSUE TAKES A CRITICAL FIRST STEP. HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. ARE AT LUCY HERNANDEZ AND ABIGAIL SO LEASE FROM SELF HELP ENTERPRISES AND MADELINE STAY NO STANO ON BEHALF OF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MY NAME IS LESLIE HERNANDEZ AND I'M FROM WEST GOSHEN IT'S AN TULARE COUNTY I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO SUPPORT A BEAD. NINE SIXTY ONE IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO USE PROPANE AND BURNED WOOD TO HEAT OUR HOMES. PROPANE IS VERY EXPENSIVE. AND OUR RESIDENTS THERE AND OUR COMMUNITY ARE VERY LOW INCOME AND CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR PROPANE. AB PROPANE -- WE HAD TO PAY UP FRONT AND THERE IS NO PAYMENT PLANS. WE AVOID USING OR HEATERS AND OTHER APPLIANCES BECAUSE WE CAN AFFORD IT. IT LEADS TO OUR CHILDREN GETTING SICK. FROM BEING CALLED AN MASON SCHOOL ALSO PROPANE TANKS ARE DANGEROUS. SOME PEOPLE RUN THEIR OFFENSE ALL NIGHT TO KEEP THEIR HOMES WARM. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THIS RIO ISSUES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. WHEN DETERMINING WHICH AT? COMMUNITIES QUALIFY FOR CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS. OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES A CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY SOURCE SOURCE. AB I AM A RATE PAYER. TO IN MY COMMUNITY IS NOT BENEFIT IN EQUALITY. EQUALLY FROM I CALIFORNIA CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS. AND THAT'S NOT FAIR. I BELIEVE ALLOWING CONSIDER CONSIDERATION. FROM ISSUES THAT AFFECT OUR COMMUNITIES. THE ISSUES THAT MATTER. THE MOST TO OUR COMMUNITY. WILL HELP TO PRODUCE BETTER AND MORE IF EFFECTIVE CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS. AND I ASKED YOU GUYS FOR SUPPORT AND AB NINETY SIX THE WENT BECAUSE THIS WILL BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON IF I COULD JUST ADD I'M I'M ABIGAIL SLEEP WITHOUT HELP ENTERPRISES WE ARE A NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I'M HELPING THEM ACCESS INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. ARE BETTER USUALLY MUCH NEEDED I'M AND I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT ADD THIS BILL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS THE ONE AB NINE SIXTY ONE WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT WE VALUE THE INTEREST OF OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IT ALSO HELPS THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION COUNTY ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO ALL CALIFORNIANS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS ADOPTED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND SOCIAL ACTION PLAN. AND IT SUPPORTS ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES WITH AN EXISTING CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS. AB NINE SIXTY ONE HELPS ENSURE THAT WE VALUE THE INTERESTS OF OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT VERY VALUABLE AND WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VALUES -- ARE -- ARE REPRESENTED -- YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE HEARD MENTION HERE TODAY MANY TIMES THAT CALIFORNIA IS A LEADING INNOVATION -- HOWEVER. THE BENEFITS OF THAT INNOVATION IS NOT TRICKLING DOWN TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST THESE COMMUNITIES ARE AMONG THE POOREST IN THE STATE HOWEVER THEY SPENT A LOT THEY SPEND A LARGER PORTION OF THEIR INCOME ON THEIR UTILITY COST. THEY LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST -- AIR POLLUTION AND THE WORST AIR QUALITY I SO -- I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR AND ABOUT TIME -- THAT WE MAKE -- THE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS ARE ASSISTING THOSE THAT NEED IT THE MOST THE POOREST COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTION AND THIS LEGISLATION IS THE NECESSARY FIRST STEP. TO CORRECTING THIS INEQUITY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU X. WAS -- THANK YOU AYE MATALIN SANTA WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE AND WE ARE RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE NONPROFIT LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN OAKLAND.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M FROM A LITTLE COMMUNITY OF SEVILLE ONE OF THE POOREST COMMUNITIES IN TAYLOR COUNTY. AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. FOR THE THIRD NOTICING ON THEM OF ANYA. THEN GOOD LUCK ON THE US A BILL. THE LOCAL NOT TO LET IT YOUR VOICE TO BE GOOD OFFICE. STAN GRESCHNER GOOD ALTERNATIVES OR NONPROFIT SOLAR ENERGY STORAGE PROVIDER AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. BRENT AND ALSO SIERRA CLUB SUPPORT THIS BILL. ACRE FERNANDEZ A LIVING TULARE COUNTY AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU ARE THEIR WITNESSES OR ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OF THE S. OVER THERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CAL CHAMBERS PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF AB NINE SIXTY ONE ON ENERGY RATES IN CALIFORNIA. I AM SUCH A LOW TALKER I WILL BE LEAN AND MORE SORRY ABOUT THAT. AS YOU KNOW INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL REPAIRS IN CALIFORNIA PAY SOME OF THE HIRES HIGHEST ENERGY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ARE IN CONSTANT COMPETITION WITH OTHER STATES RETENTION ON MANUFACTURING AGRICULTURE AND OTHER ENERGY INTENSIVE PRODUCTS. THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS EXPECT AND DEMAND WE DO UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND THE CONSIDERATION OF CO BENEFITS OF ENERGY PROGRAMS ADDITION MAGIC COMMUNITIES IS AN ONGOING IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. HOWEVER HERE THE STEEP UC'S EXPERT HE SAYS IN ECONOMICS WHEN QUANTIFIABLE COSTS A QUANTIFIABLE BENEFITS TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLE RATES CHARGED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. CPUC IS ALREADY RAMPING UP ITS EXPERTISE IN SAFETY TO RESPOND TO THE EVER INCREASING THREAT OF WILDFIRES IN CLIMATE RELATED ISSUES WHICH FOCUSES RIGHTLY A PRIORITY OF THE STATE. WITH WILDFIRES INCREASING ENERGY COSTS AND OTHER CRISES FACING CPUC THIS YEAR ADDING ON THE BURDEN OF DEVELOPING IN ANOTHER AREA OF EXPERTISE IS A CHALLENGE. THIS BILL SEEKS TO INCORPORATE PRIORITIZE A NEW DEFINITION IN THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY THE CPUC. AND USES QUITE A BROAD CATEGORY TO GUIDE THE DEFINITION ON ENTRY TO BENEFITS WELL WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESSTO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS LIVING THE SCOPE OF NON ENERGY BENEFITS TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS. WE BELIEVE THE DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE AS A C. P. YOU SEE A STUDY THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST AND IT'S INDICATED THAT THESE BENEFITS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY. AND ARE PARTICULARLY UNRELIABLE BECAUSE THEY LARGELY RELY ON SELF REPORTING CUSTOMER SURVEYS RATHER THAN THE EMPIRICAL DATA IT STUDIES THE TYPICALLY GUIDE A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. FINALLY WE BELIEVE THAT SHIFTING OF SOCIETAL COSTS AND BENEFITS SOLELY ON TO WRITE PAPERS. RATE THE RATE PAYERS IS NOT APPROPRIATE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THIS RATE MAKING AGENCY. FOR THESE REASONS CAL CHEAPER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES AB NINE SIXTY ONE AND LOOKS FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUR OFFICE. TO ADDRESS THESE REMAINING CONCERTS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE OKAY. I CHAIR MEMBERS OR DOES HE MENACE WITH SEMPRA ENERGY ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AT THE MOMENT -- WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS WILL REVIEW THOSE FURTHER TO SEE WHERE WE MIGHT STAND -- MOVING FORWARD BUT NOW WE APPRECIATE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BILL -- BUT AS AT THE ORIGINAL AS WRITTEN WE THOUGHT IT WAS DEPICTED IN MAY BE COSTLY SO WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND DOCTOR QUIRK. SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS ALL WORKS BECAUSE MOST OF OUR PROCUREMENT. IT'S GOING TO BE DONE BY THE CCA'S THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS. AND ON THE P. YOU SEE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO. SO I'M NOT SURE THAT -- I'M NOT CCA SOLAR IN A PARTICULAR AREA -- BUT SAYS CLEAN ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY I COULD SEE. OR IT WANTS TO DO AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM CAN THE CPUC EVEN TELL THE CCA WHAT TO DO -- SO THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND AS AS IT'S WRITTEN -- WE DON'T BELIEVE TOUCHES PROCUREMENT AT THAT LEVEL -- SO REALLY THE BILL ALLOWS THE CPUC TO CONSIDER THESE NON ENERGY BENEFITS WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ON D. E. R. SO DOESN'T PRESCRIBE ANYTHING DOESN'T FORCE THEM TO DIRECT -- RESOURCES IN A PARTICULAR AREA. AND IT ALSO DOESN'T CHANGE EXISTING COST EFFECTIVENESS TESTS IT'S A SUPPLEMENTAL LAYER OF ANALYSIS WHICH PERMITS THE CPUC TO CONSIDER CO BENEFITS LIKE HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABILITY -- SO TO YOUR QUESTION I I DON'T SHARE THAT -- AS A CONCERN -- AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE C. P. YOU SEE TO MAKE SURE THE SCOPE IS LIMITED AND EASY. TO IMPLEMENT SO WHAT PROGRAMS WOULD BE AFFECTED SO THE LATE NIGHT ENERGY PROCUREMENT IF THE LISTED PROGRAMS UNDER D. E. R. -- IT'S A SERIES OF PROGRAM SO I DON'T WANT TO MISS QUOTE THE ACTUAL NUMBER -- BUT WE GAVE A CITATION TO THE PUBLIC. UTILITIES CODE SECTION THAT LISTS OUT THOSE PROGRAMS -- CESAR LIST IN THE ANALYSIS PERHAPS THERE IS A PARTIAL LIST IN THE ANALYSIS -- SO IT'S AN IDEAL EXAMPLE RIGHT -- AND I COME TO THIS AND WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AS REGULATORY PRACTITIONER AT THE CPUC -- WOULD BE IN THE CONTEXT OF A PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM -- SO -- LUCY AND ABIGAIL HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PROCEEDING WHERE WE'RE PILOTING NEW CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS. IN THE COURSE OF THAT PROCEEDING WE HAD TO ARGUE VERY HARD FOR THINGS LIKE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE P. UC'S DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO AUTHORIZE THOSE PILOTS. THIS BILL GIVES OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO CONSIDER. THOSE OTHER CO BENEFITS WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR DECISION AGAIN IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE -- AND ALSO IN RESPONSE TO OTHER QUESTIONS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE QUANTITATIVE SO WE WORK WITH THE P. YOU SEE TO MAKE SURE THEIR CONCERN WAS THAT. THIS DEFINITION WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PROGRAMS -- SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND AND THAT THE LANGUAGE REFLECTS THAT THIS CAN BE QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE OKAY SO IT'S PRIMARY. SO I GOT WORD FROM THE CHAIR. THAT ITS PRIMARY ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROGRAMS IS ENERGY EFFICIENCY CRACK SO THIS WOULD MEAN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS WOULD GO PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GO TO FOR EXAMPLE A POOR RURAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE SINCE YOU'VE CHANGED IT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCREEN. IF THEY HAVE GOOD AIR THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM. THAT'S NOT HOW WE INTERPRET THE BILL SO THE BILL REQUIRES TRACKING -- AND MEASURING OF NON ENERGY BENEFITS ACROSS THE STATE. THE PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS THAT PROMOTE THOSE BENEFITS IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES WHICH WAS THE LANGUAGE WE ORIGINALLY USED -- WHICH GOES BEYOND THE CAL ENVIRO SCREEN WE'VE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENT BUT IT WENT BROADER JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE -- WELL I AS I READ THE MEN MINUTES SAYS CALLIN VIRUS SCREEN YES YES AND THEN SO HOW DOES HE GO BROADER HOW IT FATED SERIOUSLY IN. IT. I EVEN DID YOU DEVIOUSLY A DEAD BUT NOW THAT IT'S CALLUM VIRUS SCREEN WHAT HOW TO PEOPLE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES ACCESS IT -- THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OF THESE BENEFITS AND THEY WOULD ACTUALLY STILL BE ALLOWED TO MAKE THE NON ENERGY BENEFIT ARGUMENTS FOR INVESTMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO RIGHT NOW. SO THIS DOESN'T DIRECT OR MANDATE PROJECTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND ALLOWS THE CPUC TO CONSIDER THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE UNDERSERVED AND OVER POLLUTED WHEN THEY MAKE THOSE INVESTMENT AND PROGRAMMATIC EVALUATION DECISION YOU BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A RURAL COMMUNITY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY IS ALWAYS SAYING OR WOOD IS SAYING WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE COVERED IN THIS. BY THE HEALTH BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCREEN BUT WE HAVE PLENTY OF POVERTY. A SO I FIRST UP THERE ARE -- INCOME PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT MIGHT INCLUDE THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR PRIORITIZATION WERE CROSSED OUT -- I THINK MOVING FORWARD I MEAN AND THAT THAT IS A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR I KNOW THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS. BILL A IS AS BENEFICIAL AS POSSIBLE INCLUDING RURAL COMMUNITIES WE HAVE MEMBERS OF REAL COMMUNITIES HERE I HAVE BEEN WORKING. ON THAT ISSUE SO RESPECTFULLY I THINK WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO THINK THROUGH HOW TO DO THAT AND WE ACCEPT THAT -- THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WENT WITH A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT -- I APPRECIATE THAT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT SOME MAY NOT NECESSARILY BENEFIT FROM THE COUNT BY RISK FREE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THESE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. BUT I JUST REALLY WANT TO STRESS THAT IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY BOTH THEY ARE VERY LOW INCOME THEY ARE. AGRICULTURE WORKERS FARM LABORERS AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY HAVE THE WORST AIR QUALITY AND THE MOST AIR POLLUTION IN THE STATE BECAUSE THEY'RE CENTERED AROUND LARGE AG LANDS AND FARMING PRACTICES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THEIR AIR THEIR WATER. SO THESE I WOULDN'T I WOULD STATE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE EVEN MORE IMPACTED AND THOSE WHO DO NOT BENEFIT FROM THE CAL ON BY ROSE SCREEN AT THIS TIME YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU BUT YOU DID HAVE PEOPLE FROM. COMMUNITY SPEAKING HERE WHO WOULD NOT BE BENEFIT IT DOWN AND I THINK [inaudible] WELL. WILL AGREE TO DISAGREE. BEFORE THE BEFORE THE CHAIR CUTS ME OFF JUST ACT THE COMMUNITY IF THE BILL IS HERE AND THE COMMITTEE OF WEST GOSHEN THEY ARE -- SIGNIFICANT THEY ON THE CALAVERAS GREEN DAY SCORE HI THAT'S THE HIGHEST. AND I THINK THE INTENTION OF THE AUTHOR WAS TO TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A RECOGNITION THAT -- COMMUNITIES ARE DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS WERE GOING TO BE HAVE SOME FORM OF OF FOCUSED ATTENTION THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO TO GET. TO WITH THE RECOMMENDATION SO. I THINK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE. I ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS IS OUR MOTION -- THE MOTION OF YOUR IN THIS RACE YOU DO HAVE A ENJOYED DO PASSES A MINUTE TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE TAKEN YES.
