THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE FELL

00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:53.738 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN WHERE WE SHOULD EXPECT

00:47:53.504 --> 00:47:58.109 region:rollup2

IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH THE

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:19.196 region:rollup2
VENDOR TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:21.031 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS WERE HUMANE TO OUR

00:48:19.196 --> 00:48:22.099 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN THE LEGISLATURE.

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:23.768 region:rollup2
THE VENDOR HAD WORKED WITH

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:25.903 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES PREVIOUSLY

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:28.038 region:rollup2
BUT NEVER LEGISLATURE SO SOME OF

00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:29.607 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE --

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:30.875 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND ALTER TO NEW WANTS TO

00:48:29.607 --> 00:48:32.610 region:rollup2
MAKE IT RELEVANT WE DON'T

00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:33.811 region:rollup2
CELEBRATE ACT HERE WE WANT TO

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.678 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THE QUESTIONS

00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:36.180 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:39.283 region:rollup2
TO SO EMPLOYEES WOULD NOW THAT

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.518 region:rollup2
IT.

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:41.952 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE REALLY GOOD NEWS

00:48:40.518 --> 00:48:43.287 region:rollup2
AS YOU'LL SEE EMPLOYEES ARE

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:44.555 region:rollup2
SATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK DUTIES

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:46.423 region:rollup2
THAT ARE COMMITTED TO THEIR WORK

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:47.458 region:rollup2
IN PUBLIC SERVICE 70% ARE

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:49.393 region:rollup2
SATISFIED.

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:52.263 region:rollup2
JOB DUTIES DECIDED AS THE NUMBER

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:53.664 region:rollup2
ONE REASON EMPLOYEES ARE STAYING

00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:55.099 region:rollup2
78% OF EMPLOYEES INDICATE THE

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:56.500 region:rollup2
INTENT TO REMAIN EMPLOYED BUT

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:57.735 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.936 region:rollup2
AND EMPLOYEES WERE SATISFIED

00:48:57.735 --> 00:49:00.004 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR HEALTH PLANS AND

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:01.472 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:49:00.004 --> 00:49:03.507 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO DELIVERING HIGH

00:49:01.472 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
QUALITY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC

00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:06.844 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:08.813 region:rollup2
NEXT SLIDE.

00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:10.815 region:rollup2
THIS FOR ME I THINK I AS A

00:49:08.813 --> 00:49:12.516 region:rollup2
FORMER STAFF.

00:49:10.815 --> 00:49:14.785 region:rollup2
ALBEIT DECADES AGO AS WELL AS A

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:16.520 region:rollup2
MEMBER AND AS AN EMPLOYER.

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:18.155 region:rollup2
ARE THESE RESULT RESULTS I THINK

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.757 region:rollup2
WITH THE MOST --

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:21.125 region:rollup2
AYE OPENING AND REWARDING

00:49:19.757 --> 00:49:22.459 region:rollup2
RESULTS INDICATE STRONG

00:49:21.125 --> 00:49:24.895 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS WITH COWORKERS AND

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:27.198 region:rollup2
LEADERS 83% OF EMPLOYEES ARE

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:28.666 region:rollup2
ENGAGED BY THEIR CO WORKERS. 70%

00:49:27.198 --> 00:49:29.500 region:rollup2
OF EMPLOYEES ARE ENGAGED BY THE

00:49:28.666 --> 00:49:31.769 region:rollup2
DIRECT IMMEDIATE STEPS

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.103 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR AND OVER 80% OF

00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:36.006 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES BELIEVE THEIR

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:37.541 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR IS TRUSTWORTHY CARING

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:39.109 region:rollup2
AND LISTENS TO THEIR IDEAS.

00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:40.477 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT AND

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:42.046 region:rollup2
ALSO IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION WE

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:43.781 region:rollup2
WERE CLEAR --

00:49:42.046 --> 00:49:45.649 region:rollup2
THAT IT WAS THE ON YOUR MOST

00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:46.984 region:rollup2
DIRECT SUPERVISOR.

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:48.452 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF

00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:50.221 region:rollup2
RESPONDING THEY'RE RESPONDING

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:51.322 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THE LEGISLATOR IF

00:49:50.221 --> 00:49:53.090 region:rollup2
IT WAS A LET JAY.

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:54.925 region:rollup2
THEY WERE RESPONDING THEY THAT

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.927 region:rollup2
WE DEFINE TO THEIR SUPERVISOR

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:59.063 region:rollup2
WAS BASED ON THEIR SPECIFIC

00:49:56.927 --> 00:50:00.764 region:rollup2
POSITION SO ON LEGISLATOR SHOULD

00:49:59.063 --> 00:50:02.466 region:rollup2
NOT ASSUME THAT ALL OF THOSE

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:04.368 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WHERE --

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:05.903 region:rollup2
TRICK THAT IT US WHAT WAS ON

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:07.972 region:rollup2
POWERFUL ABOUT THAT AS WE TALK

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:09.707 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE NEED TO CHANGE CULTURE

00:50:07.972 --> 00:50:11.008 region:rollup2
IS RECOGNIZING.

00:50:09.707 --> 00:50:12.610 region:rollup2
HOW FOLKS FEEL ABOUT THEIR

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:13.177 region:rollup2
COWORKERS THEY SPEND MORE TIME

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:13.878 region:rollup2
WITH EACH OTHER THAN THEY DO

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:17.114 region:rollup2
WITH US?

00:50:13.878 --> 00:50:18.849 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS PERSON THAT THEY HAVE

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:20.451 region:rollup2
TO RELY ON TO GET.

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.886 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL INFORMATION AND

00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:22.987 region:rollup2
WHO THEY REPORT CONCERNS IN THE

00:50:21.886 --> 00:50:25.089 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE TO WHICH IS THEIR

00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:26.657 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR AND THAT'S THE PERSON

00:50:25.089 --> 00:50:27.892 region:rollup2
THAT THEY FEEL LISTENS TO THEM

00:50:26.657 --> 00:50:29.960 region:rollup2
THAT THEY FEEL LESS TRUSTWORTHY

00:50:27.892 --> 00:50:31.662 region:rollup2
IN CARES ABOUT THEM.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.264 region:rollup2
SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

00:50:31.662 --> 00:50:34.765 region:rollup2
TAKING A TEMPERATURE CHECK OF

00:50:33.264 --> 00:50:36.734 region:rollup2
THE CULTURE OF THE INSTITUTION

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:38.068 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT THE VAST

00:50:36.734 --> 00:50:39.169 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES FEEL

00:50:38.068 --> 00:50:41.205 region:rollup2
GOOD ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:44.241 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR DIRECT SUPERVISOR.

00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:46.210 region:rollup2
IS A REAL STRENGTH NEXT SLIDE.

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:48.112 region:rollup2

00:50:55.452 --> 00:50:59.390 region:rollup2
THAT GOOD OR NOT --

00:50:57.855 --> 00:51:01.358 region:rollup2

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:02.893 region:rollup2
REPORT WHICH YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:04.929 region:rollup2

TERMS OF OUR RATING.

00:51:04.929 --> 00:51:07.531 region:rollup2
AND COMPARED TO OTHER GOVERNMENT

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:09.300 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS AND AGAIN IN THE

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:10.834 region:rollup2
AREAS OF OUR STRENGTH WE READ

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.669 region:rollup2
THE HIGH PERFORMING IN.

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:13.137 region:rollup2
NOW WITH REGARD TO

00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:14.605 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:15.606 region:rollup2
CLEARLY BASED ON THE NUMBERS YOU

00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:17.908 region:rollup2
SEE THESE ARE AREAS WHERE WE

00:51:15.606 --> 00:51:18.776 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FOCUS AND TARGET OUR

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.144 region:rollup2
EFFORTS SO WE CAN SEE SOME

00:51:18.776 --> 00:51:21.912 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT.

00:51:20.144 --> 00:51:23.213 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES DO NOT FEEL SECURE IN

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.781 region:rollup2
THEIR JOBS AND DO NOT FEEL

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:25.883 region:rollup2
RESPECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:27.618 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:51:25.883 --> 00:51:28.886 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE OVERALL QUESTION

00:51:27.618 --> 00:51:30.054 region:rollup2
55% OF EMPLOYEES BELIEVE

00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:31.655 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS OF

00:51:30.054 --> 00:51:34.458 region:rollup2
POWER SUPPORT AND HARASSMENT

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:36.527 region:rollup2
FREE WORK ENVIRONMENT. 38% DO

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:37.761 region:rollup2
NOT BELIEVE VICTIMS OR REPORTERS

RETALIATION. 33% DO NOT BELIEVE

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:44.568 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE ACTUAL BE TAKEN

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:45.669 region:rollup2
AFTER A COMPLAINT IS MADE.

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.937 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS STRIKING ABOUT THE

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:48.372 region:rollup2
STATISTICS ONLY LOOKED AT THE

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:49.139 region:rollup2
OVERALL REPORT IS?

00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:50.207 region:rollup2
I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:51.709 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE BUT IT WAS A

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:53.077 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY HIGH.

00:51:51.709 --> 00:51:55.846 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT SAID THEY

00:51:53.077 --> 00:51:58.115 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD OUR POLICY.

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:59.383 region:rollup2
SO UNDERSTANDING THE POLICY AND

00:51:58.115 --> 00:52:01.518 region:rollup2
YET HAVING FEELINGS THAT A

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:02.353 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT MORE BE MADE

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.087 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE ACTIONS WILL BE

00:52:02.353 --> 00:52:05.222 region:rollup2
TAKEN.

00:52:03.087 --> 00:52:07.458 region:rollup2
AND EMPLOYEES WILL BE FREE FROM

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:09.493 region:rollup2
RETALIATION REALLY HELPED US

00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:10.928 region:rollup2
KIND OF LASER FOCUSING IN ON

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:12.329 region:rollup2
WHAT OUR CORE.

00:52:10.928 --> 00:52:14.231 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS IN TERMS OF OUR

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:16.800 region:rollup2
CULTURE AND EMPLOYEES FEELING

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:19.036 region:rollup2
HURT AND HAVE IN THE PAST --

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.904 region:rollup2
TOWARDS HAVING WORKPLACE

00:52:19.036 --> 00:52:21.605 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES RESOLVE IN A HEALTHY

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:26.143 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE WAY.

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:27.845 region:rollup2
NEXT LIVE. TWO OF THOSE WHO WHO

00:52:26.143 --> 00:52:29.246 region:rollup2
INDICATE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE

00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:30.714 region:rollup2
OUR WITNESS HARASSMENT HEY

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:31.281 region:rollup2
FEMALES REPORTED HIGHER

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:32.249 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS OF HARASSMENT THAN

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.717 region:rollup2
MEN.

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:35.819 region:rollup2
BE THE PERCENTAGE OF SUPERVISORS

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:37.621 region:rollup2
REPORT HARASSMENT IS HIGHER THAN

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:39.490 region:rollup2
THAT OF NON SUPERVISORS HOWEVER

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:40.724 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF NON SUPERVISORS

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.860 region:rollup2
REPORTING HARASSMENT IS GREATER

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:44.228 region:rollup2
THAN THAT OF SUPERVISORS SEE.

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.496 region:rollup2
THE MOST PREVALENT IN THE CASE

00:52:44.228 --> 00:52:48.298 region:rollup2
OF HARASSMENT RESULTED FROM

00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:49.566 region:rollup2
LOBBYISTS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:51.702 region:rollup2
CAPITAL EMPLOYEES REPORTED

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:53.203 region:rollup2
HIGHER INCIDENCE OF THAN THOSE

00:52:51.702 --> 00:52:55.739 region:rollup2
LOCATED IN THE DISTRICT.

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:57.374 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SEE WAS --

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:59.610 region:rollup2
PAINFUL.

00:52:57.374 --> 00:53:02.146 region:rollup2
CLEAR INFORMATION FOR US ALL TO

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:05.482 region:rollup2
RECEIVE I THINK --

00:53:02.146 --> 00:53:07.217 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THE CASES

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:09.386 region:rollup2
INVOLVING ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:11.055 region:rollup2
LET US DOWN THIS PATH TO REVAMP

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:14.291 region:rollup2
IN DEVELOPING THESE NEW SYSTEMS

00:53:11.055 --> 00:53:14.825 region:rollup2
I THINK OUR ASSUMPTIONS WORD

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.060 region:rollup2
THAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT

00:53:14.825 --> 00:53:16.693 region:rollup2
QUESTION WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.429 region:rollup2
AND SO NOW THAT WE'RE CLEAR THAT

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:20.097 region:rollup2
--

00:53:18.429 --> 00:53:21.698 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOT ONLY TO DEAL WITH

00:53:20.097 --> 00:53:23.734 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING AN INTERNAL PROCESS

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:25.235 region:rollup2
THAT GOVERNS US AS LEGISLATORS

00:53:23.734 --> 00:53:30.274 region:rollup2
AND STAFF THE STAFF.

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:31.975 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO HOW WE MANAGE --

00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:33.410 region:rollup2
STAFF EXPERIENCES WITH THE

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:34.711 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL COMMUNITY THE GENERAL

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:36.947 region:rollup2
PUBLIC --

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:38.348 region:rollup2
ALSO THOSE WHO ENGAGE AS KEY

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:39.716 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR WORKPLACE ON

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:44.421 region:rollup2
A REGULAR BASIS [inaudible]

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:46.623 region:rollup2
NEXT SLIDE.

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:49.660 region:rollup2
AND SO THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:51.528 region:rollup2
PROVIDE US WITH A BASED ON THEIR

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.996 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE IN DOING CLIMATE

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:54.998 region:rollup2
SURVEYS.

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:57.434 region:rollup2
ARE ENGAGING WITH ORGANIZATIONS

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:58.202 region:rollup2
WHO ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING

00:53:57.434 --> 00:54:00.003 region:rollup2
AND CHANGING THEIR WORKPLACE

00:53:58.202 --> 00:54:01.538 region:rollup2
CULTURE THESE ARE SOME OF THE

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:03.307 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:03.874 region:rollup2
AFFORDED US NUMBER.

00:54:03.307 --> 00:54:06.910 region:rollup2
ONE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

00:54:03.874 --> 00:54:08.612 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:11.081 region:rollup2
AND AND THE FOCUS IS REVIEW

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:13.450 region:rollup2
RESET EVALUATE AND ENFORCED

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:14.918 region:rollup2
REVIEW MEANS TO ASSESS POLICIES

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:16.420 region:rollup2
AND PROCEDURES AND THEIR LOVE

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:17.454 region:rollup2
AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.522 region:rollup2
CURRENT CLIMATE.

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:21.325 region:rollup2
ARE THE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE

00:54:18.522 --> 00:54:23.160 region:rollup2
CULTURE ARE THEY CLEARLY DEFINED

00:54:21.325 --> 00:54:24.261 region:rollup2
WE HEARD WITNESS AFTER WITNESS

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.363 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT.

00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:28.966 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE DID RESEARCH BASED

00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:31.201 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE BASE NEW APPROACH TO

00:54:28.966 --> 00:54:32.970 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND THAT IS NOT A ONE

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:34.037 region:rollup2
SHOT DEAL EVERY TWO YEARS BUT AS

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.639 region:rollup2
WE KNOW IN TERMS OF OUR OWN

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:36.974 region:rollup2
LIVES IN TERMS OF BEAT TRUE

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.342 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR CHANGE.

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:39.776 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT KIND OF

00:54:38.342 --> 00:54:41.145 region:rollup2
TRAINING SO WE SPENT A LOT OF

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:43.147 region:rollup2
TIME TALKING ABOUT BYSTANDER

00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:45.282 region:rollup2
TRAINING MORE FREQUENT TRAINING

00:54:43.147 --> 00:54:46.784 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT IS DESIGNED WITH

00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:50.354 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE IN MIND AND SO

00:54:46.784 --> 00:54:52.022 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A GENERIC --

00:54:50.354 --> 00:54:53.857 region:rollup2
AT JANE AND JOE ARE HAVING A

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:56.493 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AT THE WATERCOOLER

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:59.463 region:rollup2
BUT REAL EXPERIENCES --

00:54:56.493 --> 00:55:00.998 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE A LEAD J..

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:01.832 region:rollup2
OR IF YOU ARE A FIELD DEPTH IN A

00:55:00.998 --> 00:55:03.667 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC A

00:55:01.832 --> 00:55:05.636 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENT COMES IN THE OFFICE

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:07.304 region:rollup2
AND DOES INAPPROPRIATE THINGS GO

00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:09.106 region:rollup2
OUT HOW DO YOU MANAGE THOSE.

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:10.807 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE CLEAR THAT WE PROBABLY

00:55:09.106 --> 00:55:13.143 region:rollup2
NEED TO REVIEW OUR POLICIES AND

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:14.111 region:rollup2
OUR PRACTICES AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:16.413 region:rollup2
THEY REFLECT.

00:55:14.111 --> 00:55:18.081 region:rollup2
CURRENT BEST PRACTICE IN THE

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:20.083 region:rollup2
FIELD OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT.

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:21.485 region:rollup2
RESET EDUCATE EMPLOYEES ON

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:23.053 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE AVENUES TO LOCK

00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:24.755 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:25.722 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE COMPLAINT

00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:27.291 region:rollup2
IS MADE.

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:28.792 region:rollup2
I THINK THE RESET IS REALLY WHAT

00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:30.894 region:rollup2
WE'RE FOCUSED ON TODAY IN TERMS

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:32.696 region:rollup2

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:36.433 region:rollup2

A FRAMEWORK FOR A NEW SYSTEM.

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:39.903 region:rollup2
EVALUATE FREAK WILL EVALUATE THE

00:55:38.602 --> 00:55:41.305 region:rollup2

THOSE LAST TWO ARE INCLUDED IN

00:55:56.854 --> 00:55:59.456 region:rollup2

ON THE INDUSTRY STANDARD --

00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:27.244 region:rollup2

IN MONTHS OR YEARS TO FOLLOW

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:39.189 region:rollup2
WE'RE CLEAR BASED ON THE FACT

00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:40.524 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN BE A BUREAUCRATIC.

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:43.060 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THAT SOMETIME IT

00:57:40.524 --> 00:57:44.594 region:rollup2

THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:58:24.835 --> 00:58:29.006 region:rollup2
SHARES --

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:30.540 region:rollup2
THE ONCE LIKE YOU HAD ABOUT THE

00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:32.809 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF THE LOBBYISTS AND THE

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:35.045 region:rollup2
OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS.

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:36.880 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS.

00:58:35.045 --> 00:58:39.716 region:rollup2
IF IF IT DOES A LOBBYIST AFTER

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:44.154 region:rollup2
REGISTER. TO COME INTO THIS

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:46.056 region:rollup2
BUILDING IS OUR A REQUIREMENT.

00:58:44.154 --> 00:58:47.691 region:rollup2
HAVING SPENT SOME TIME IN A

00:58:46.056 --> 00:58:50.227 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS LIFE AS A REGISTERED

00:58:47.691 --> 00:58:51.561 region:rollup2
LOBBYIST TO TO YOU DO HAVE TO

00:58:50.227 --> 00:58:53.330 region:rollup2
REGISTER WITH THE SECRETARY OF

STATE.

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:56.266 region:rollup2
TO BE CONSIDERED A LOBBYIST TO

00:58:54.965 --> 00:58:57.634 region:rollup2
ENTER THE BUILDING NIGHT I THINK

00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:58.769 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT

00:58:57.634 --> 00:59:00.270 region:rollup2
INTO THE BUILDINGS I DON'T THINK

00:58:58.769 --> 00:59:01.171 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PART OF THE REQUIREMENT

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.439 region:rollup2
TO REGISTER.

00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:03.340 region:rollup2
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO REGISTER AND

00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:04.808 region:rollup2
THE PRIDE THAT REGISTRATION

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.444 region:rollup2
INCLUDES YOU KNOWDOCUMENT YOU

00:59:04.808 --> 00:59:08.879 region:rollup2
LEFT FILE ON TERMS OF GIFTS YOU

00:59:07.444 --> 00:59:09.846 region:rollup2
KNOW ALL THAT PROCESS BUT YOU

00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:11.048 region:rollup2
HAVE. TO SIT THROUGH THE

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:11.648 region:rollup2
REGISTERED LOBBYISTS THAT IS A

00:59:11.048 --> 00:59:14.351 region:rollup2
TERM THAT YES YOU DO REGISTER

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:17.120 region:rollup2
SO.

00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:17.721 region:rollup2
COULD THIS POLICY.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.057 region:rollup2
OUR LEASE WE CAN LOOK AT THE

00:59:17.721 --> 00:59:20.357 region:rollup2
POLICY IF IF YOU HAVE

00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:22.826 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:59:20.357 --> 00:59:24.361 region:rollup2
BEEN.

00:59:22.826 --> 00:59:25.629 region:rollup2
SO THAT IF SOMEONE HAS REPORTED

00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:27.364 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE [inaudible]

00:59:25.629 --> 00:59:29.166 region:rollup2
USED THEM.

00:59:27.364 --> 00:59:31.802 region:rollup2
THEN COULD THAT BE A FACTOR IN

00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:34.304 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT WE REGISTER.

00:59:31.802 --> 00:59:36.673 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE ACTUAL QUESTION THAT

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:37.874 region:rollup2
WAS POSED ON THE SURVEY IT WAS

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:39.075 region:rollup2
ONE QUESTION AS I RECALL

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:40.944 region:rollup2
REGISTERED LOBBYISTS MEMBER THE

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:42.145 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND SO I THINK THAT WE

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:44.047 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE CLEAR.

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:45.315 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S A BROAD CATEGORY NOT

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:46.850 region:rollup2
JUST REGISTERED LOBBYISTS BUT

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:48.418 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL PUBLIC YOU KNOW

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.020 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OFFICE STAFFS --

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:52.289 region:rollup2
ON PARTICIPATED NAM IN THE

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:53.657 region:rollup2
SURVEY AS WELL AND SO WE DON'T

00:59:52.289 --> 00:59:56.059 region:rollup2
KNOW -- OF

00:59:53.657 --> 00:59:56.793 region:rollup2
ALL THE CASES WHICH FALL UNDER

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:58.228 region:rollup2
THE REGISTERED LOBBYISTS

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:59.229 region:rollup2
CATEGORY VERSES MEMBER OF THE

00:59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.430 region:rollup2
PUBLIC --

00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.698 region:rollup2
YOU'LL HEAR --

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:04.134 region:rollup2
AS THE CHAIR WOMAN WALKS US

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:04.935 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL THE FRAMEWORK THAT

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.536 region:rollup2
WE'RE PROPOSING ON AN

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:08.271 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT DATA

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:10.006 region:rollup2
POINT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.808 region:rollup2
BACK AND DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:12.609 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT LEGALLY WHAT WE

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:14.478 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:16.146 region:rollup2
DO PALM BUT I THINK MOST

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:18.281 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THE CLIMATE SURVEY

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:19.950 region:rollup2
SURFACED FACT AND IT'S NOW ON

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.718 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S RADAR SCREEN AND IT

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:25.789 region:rollup2
WILL CLEARLY BE A PART.

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:27.724 region:rollup2
OF OF OUR NEW REFORM PROCESS.

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.992 region:rollup2
CAN DO LEGALLY WE HAVEN'T IRONED

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:30.160 region:rollup2
OUT YET BUT I THINK YOUR

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:32.062 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.131 region:rollup2
SHOULD ADD TO OUR PARKING LOT AS

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:35.265 region:rollup2
A POTENTIAL SOLUTION.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.500 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT SPECIFIC

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:37.901 region:rollup2
ANSWER FOR YOU TODAY.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.804 region:rollup2
SENATE MITCHELL THANK YOU BOTH

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:42.305 region:rollup2
FOR TO GREAT JOB.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:44.274 region:rollup2
IF I MAY JUMP IN ON THAT I THINK

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.575 region:rollup2
THAT PUTS A SPOTLIGHT ON APPOINT

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:47.444 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR FRIEDMAN [inaudible]

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:48.912 region:rollup2
HAS STRESSED.

01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:50.714 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:53.250 region:rollup2
BROUGHT TO US TODAY.

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:54.885 region:rollup2
AND REFLECT OUTSTANDING EFFORT

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.453 region:rollup2
BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:59.055 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK OVER THE COURSE

01:00:56.453 --> 01:01:00.223 region:rollup2
OF TIME AS WE AS WE IMPLEMENT

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.690 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:02.359 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BE SEVEN TWO

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:04.194 region:rollup2
REFINEMENT.

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:05.162 region:rollup2
THAT -- I I

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:06.930 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T TICKETS WERE BEING

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.331 region:rollup2
HONEST WITH OURSELVES IF WE ACT

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:10.967 region:rollup2
TODAY'S IF WE COMPREHENSIVELY

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:12.235 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL UNFOLD.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:14.371 region:rollup2
THIS BY THE WAY TRACKS WITH WHAT

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:15.372 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IN LA COUNTY WHERE THE

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:17.140 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS CAME FROM.

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:19.109 region:rollup2
THERE POLICY WENT TO AT LEAST

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.710 region:rollup2
THREE ITERATIONS OVER TIME.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:22.546 region:rollup2
AND IT ALSO IS IN ACCORD WITH

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:24.581 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT HOUSE RULE ON OUR

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:27.117 region:rollup2
HOUSE.

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:28.151 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE ON HARASSMENT.

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:30.587 region:rollup2
WHICH CONTEMPLATES THAT WE HAVE

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:31.588 region:rollup2
A POLICY BUT WILL BE SEPARATE

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:33.323 region:rollup2
REVISIONIST SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:34.958 region:rollup2
REQUIRE.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:35.792 region:rollup2
SO I JUST THINK YOUR POINT IS A

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:37.627 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:38.161 region:rollup2
ONE BUT EXACTLY HOW IT APPLIES

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.796 region:rollup2
IN THE GIVEN FACT PATTERNS

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:41.531 region:rollup2
SINCE.

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:42.799 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE ENTER THE BUILDING

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.067 region:rollup2
EXERCISING THEIR FIRST MATTER

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.936 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO SPEECH.

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:47.704 region:rollup2
SOME HAVE A FORMAL BUSINESS ROLE

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:49.272 region:rollup2
HERE IS RICHARD LOBBYIST.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:51.274 region:rollup2
BUT ULTIMATELY WE ARE CONCERNED

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:52.742 region:rollup2
WITH IN GENERAL ENVIRONMENT THAT

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:54.544 region:rollup2
IS FAIR AND SAFE AND PEOPLE KNOW

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:56.913 region:rollup2
WHAT'S.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:58.181 region:rollup2
ALLOWABLE I JUST DO THINK THERE

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:59.916 region:rollup2
WILL BE A LEARNING CURVE A TO

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.784 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THE WORK.

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.786 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT A HEAVY LIFT OF

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:04.588 region:rollup2
LEARNING OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES

01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:05.822 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN.

01:02:04.588 --> 01:02:07.290 region:rollup2
SO IT'S AN ONGOING WORK A TO BE

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:08.992 region:rollup2
SURE.

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.994 region:rollup2
A LOT WITH THAT [inaudible]

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:12.462 region:rollup2

TO BE REDUNDANT TRY NOT TO BE

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.370 region:rollup2
REDONE WITH ANYTHING THAT SHE

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:22.238 region:rollup2
PRESENTED TO YOU --

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.640 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO OUTLINE --

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.608 region:rollup2
THE FRAMEWORK FOR THIS POLICY OF

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.709 region:rollup2
COURSE YOU ALL HAVE WRITTEN

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:27.777 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS THAT THAT GIVE A LOT

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:29.312 region:rollup2
MORE DETAIL SO THIS WILL BE A

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:31.514 region:rollup2
MORE HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSION --

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:33.416 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL EVERY CHANGE THAT

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:34.985 region:rollup2
WE'RE RECOMMENDING TO EVERY

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.319 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF THIS POLICY IS WITH

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:38.288 region:rollup2
WITH THE GOAL OF CULTURE CHANGE

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:39.356 region:rollup2
IN THE INSTITUTION.

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:41.324 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT --

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:43.093 region:rollup2
WRITTEN POLICY IS MEANINGLESS

01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:44.828 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT REAL CULTURAL BRIAN

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:47.297 region:rollup2
AND CULTURE CHANGE AND SO THAT'S

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:48.965 region:rollup2
WHAT ALL OF THIS POLICY IS

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:50.567 region:rollup2
REALLY INTENDING TO DO.

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:54.404 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY --

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:55.639 region:rollup2
AND THAT CULTURE CHANGE IS --

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:57.440 region:rollup2
ONE TWO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF

01:02:55.639 --> 01:03:00.543 region:rollup2
RESPECTABILITY AND DIVERSITY

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.811 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE --

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.545 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING OF ALL OF THAT OF

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:04.014 region:rollup2
COURSE IS A MUCH MORE

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.481 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE KIND OF TRAINING

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:06.283 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AS THE SENATOR

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:08.084 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:09.119 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT'S MORE RELEVANT TO

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.520 region:rollup2
OUR PARTICULAR WORKPLACE WITH

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:12.689 region:rollup2
MORE EXPLANATIONS ABOUT SOME OF

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:15.091 region:rollup2
THE GRAY AREAS THAT THAT WE HAVE

01:03:12.689 --> 01:03:16.993 region:rollup2
BETWEEN OUR WORK QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.594 region:rollup2
WORK ENVIRONMENT HERE IN THE

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.128 region:rollup2
BUILDING BUT THEN.

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:20.664 region:rollup2
THE OFTEN BEING OUT IN THE

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:22.098 region:rollup2
FIELD.

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:22.899 region:rollup2
STILL ENCOUNTERING MEMBERS OF

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.734 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC IN YOUR OFFICIAL

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:26.770 region:rollup2
CAPACITY AND STAFFERS AND MAKING

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.370 region:rollup2
SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.738 region:rollup2
THAT'S STILL AN EXTENSION OF

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:30.106 region:rollup2
YOUR WORKPLACE IN OUR POLICY

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:31.274 region:rollup2
STILL APPLY.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:33.410 region:rollup2
IN BRINGING IN --

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:36.212 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT HAS MORE --

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:37.514 region:rollup2
QUANTITATIVE DATA OF EFFICACY A

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:39.282 region:rollup2
RETRAINING LIKE BYSTANDER

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:43.486 region:rollup2
TRAINING AN IMPLICIT BIAS

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:43.486 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND AND I INTERACTIVE

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.855 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE OUT

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:47.257 region:rollup2
THERE TO HAVE A MUCH MORE

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:49.225 region:rollup2
ENGAGING AND ONGOING.

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:50.694 region:rollup2
TRAINING FOR UP FOR EVERYBODY

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:53.797 region:rollup2
WHO WORKS IN THIS BUILDING.

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:55.131 region:rollup2
OUR CODE IS ASPIRATIONAL IT'S

01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:56.833 region:rollup2
MUCH BROADER THAN WHAT WE'VE HAD

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:59.302 region:rollup2
BEFORE IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:00.403 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR THAT IT COVERS AND

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:01.538 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE A SEA CHANGE

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:03.106 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:04.074 region:rollup2
WE ARE NO LONGER GOING TO WAIT

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:06.176 region:rollup2
FOR SOMETHING TO RISE TO THE

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.710 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF LEGALLY ACTIONABLE

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:07.977 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO TAKE

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:09.279 region:rollup2
ACTION.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.513 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:12.682 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONE ELEMENT OF SEXUAL

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:14.117 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IS PERVASIVENESS SO

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.652 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN COME IN EARLY.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:18.088 region:rollup2
THE VERY FIRST TIME AN INCIDENT

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:20.690 region:rollup2
OCCURS ONE JOKE ONE

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:22.325 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE PHYSICAL CONDUCT.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:24.027 region:rollup2
BOB ONE INAPPROPRIATE IMAGE

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:25.995 region:rollup2
BEING SHARED ON A COMPUTER.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.997 region:rollup2
WE CAN THEN OFFER TRAINING AND

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:29.432 region:rollup2
COUNSELING AND CORRECT THAT

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:31.000 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR BEFORE WE DO HAVE A

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:32.302 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE A STAFFER FEELS

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.704 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN UP HOSTILE

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:36.406 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE. FOR MONTHS ON END

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:38.074 region:rollup2
FEELS THAT THEY HAVE O COME FOR

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:39.042 region:rollup2
WITH A VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATION

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.977 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT IT MEANS THAT WE'RE

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:43.513 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ASKING OUR STAFF AND

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:45.515 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER. TO REPORT ON THOSE

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:47.050 region:rollup2
SORTS OF INCIDENCES --

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:48.385 region:rollup2
AND IN A MUCH EARLIER IN MUCH

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:50.120 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAY.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:51.888 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THE GOAL IS TOWARDS

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:54.157 region:rollup2
CORRECT CREEK CORRECTIVE

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:56.326 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR NOT PUNITIVE ACTION SO

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:57.861 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN GIVE THAT EMPLOYEE

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:59.796 region:rollup2
OR EACH OTHER THE CHANCE TO

01:04:57.861 --> 01:05:01.931 region:rollup2
COURSE CORRECT --

01:04:59.796 --> 01:05:02.799 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THAT'S VERY

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.401 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WE'VE SEEN AND FOR

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:05.568 region:rollup2
INSTANCE WAS REFERENCE LA COUNTY

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.569 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS A SIMILAR KIND OF CODE

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.837 region:rollup2
OF CONDUCT.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:09.906 region:rollup2
THAT THAT BEGINS THEN THE DISK

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:10.974 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THE ACTUAL CULTURAL

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.474 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:12.375 region:rollup2
THEN YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:14.310 region:rollup2
THINKING.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.678 region:rollup2
IS THIS ACTION GOING TO BE

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.380 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S REPORTABLE

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:19.382 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN SAYING WELL I CAN

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.451 region:rollup2
HAVE X. AMOUNT OF INAPPROPRIATE

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:23.753 region:rollup2
CONDUCT BEFORE IT IT CROSSES THE

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:27.323 region:rollup2
LINE YOU WANT TO GET IN EARLY

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:30.160 region:rollup2
AND STOP THAT BEHAVIOR --

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:32.796 region:rollup2
THAT CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THIS

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.831 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS PROCESS IS BASED ON

01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:37.434 region:rollup2
PROTECTED CLASS.

01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:39.803 region:rollup2
SO AGE GENDER DISABILITY SEXUAL

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:41.171 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION RACE.

01:05:39.803 --> 01:05:43.473 region:rollup2
BASED ON THAT PROTECTED CLASS

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:45.175 region:rollup2
WILL MOVE IT INTO THE REALM OF

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:47.110 region:rollup2
THIS POLICY RATHER THAN A

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:48.878 region:rollup2
TYPICAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRACK

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.814 region:rollup2
WHICH OTHER TYPES OF WORKPLACE

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:52.415 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS WILL STILL CONTINUE TO

01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:53.216 region:rollup2
BE REFERRED.

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:54.617 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN ALL OF OUR

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:56.219 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS REINFORCED

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:57.120 region:rollup2
CHANGE SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:58.388 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.257 region:rollup2
OF THE BEGINNING OF THAT IS TO

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:02.125 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT UNIT.

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:03.960 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL BE HOUSE UNDER

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.728 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL BUT WILL BE

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.163 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT AND SIGH LOAD SO

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:09.432 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN WORK WITHOUT.

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:11.034 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SORT OF HAVING THE

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:12.669 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OF THIS OF LEGISLATIVE

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:14.504 region:rollup2
COUNSEL.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:16.840 region:rollup2
WHO BOMBED AND THE THE

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:18.141 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT BRINGS SO?

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.009 region:rollup2
THAT INDEPENDENT LEGISLATIVE

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:21.911 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:23.680 region:rollup2
YOU TO CUT OUR CONDUCT UNIT.

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:25.849 region:rollup2
WILL BE BI CAMERAL WHICH IS

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.282 region:rollup2
AGAIN A SEA CHANGE FOR HOW WE

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:30.220 region:rollup2
OPERATE.

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:30.220 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF OTHER.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:33.523 region:rollup2
IT SEE IT IS SEEN AS BEING

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:35.625 region:rollup2
UNBIASED AND FAIR TO EVERYBODY

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:37.961 region:rollup2
WHO.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:39.362 region:rollup2
GOES WELL I'M IN FRONT OF IT.

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:42.565 region:rollup2
IT WILL HAVE TRAIN SUBJECT

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:44.834 region:rollup2
MATTER EXPERTS. TO WORK ON THESE

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:46.703 region:rollup2
ISSUES IT WILL BE IN PLACE TO

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:48.271 region:rollup2
ADVISE SUPERVISORS AND STOP ON

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:49.639 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE CONDUCT.

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:53.076 region:rollup2
ITS DUTIES WILL BE TO TAKE

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:55.445 region:rollup2
REPORTS TO DO AND IN THE INITIAL

01:06:53.076 --> 01:06:57.447 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AND ASSESSMENT.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:59.115 region:rollup2
AND ALSO INVESTIGATIONS AND WHAT

01:06:57.447 --> 01:07:00.383 region:rollup2
WE HEARD FROM THE EXPERTS WHO

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:01.918 region:rollup2
TALKED TO US ABOUT

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:03.319 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS WASTE TYPES OF

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:05.088 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS IS YOU MUST AS AN

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:06.756 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER BE ABLE TO GET TO THE

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:07.957 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES BELIEVE

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:09.359 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT FAIR

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:10.927 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:13.196 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS DOING THOSE IN HOUSE

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:15.164 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IF THE INVESTIGATORS ARE

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:16.499 region:rollup2
BEING ASKED TO DO INVESTIGATIONS

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.667 region:rollup2
ON THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:18.935 region:rollup2
BE ABOVE THEM ON THE

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.036 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CHART LIKE

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:20.870 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.906 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE YOU WOULD PROBABLY

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.941 region:rollup2
SEND THAT OUT FOR EXTERNAL

01:07:22.906 --> 01:07:27.210 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS SO THERE'S SORT

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:28.378 region:rollup2
OF A CLEAR YOU KNOW DEMARCATION

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.812 region:rollup2
LINE AS TO WHAT YOU DO

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:31.414 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY AND WHAT YOU DO

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:32.682 region:rollup2
EXTERNALLY BUT YOU MUST GET TO

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:34.183 region:rollup2
THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THE

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:35.485 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF YOUR STAFF YOU KNOW

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:37.153 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR ORDINARY.

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:38.321 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS INTERNALLY.

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:39.989 region:rollup2
AND THERE WILL BE TIMES WHERE

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:41.057 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THOSE KINDS

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:42.592 region:rollup2
OF INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE THE

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.459 region:rollup2
PARTIES WILL ALL AGREE ON WHAT

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:44.761 region:rollup2
HAPPENED AND WHAT THE INCIDENT

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:48.164 region:rollup2
WAS [inaudible]

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:50.066 region:rollup2
AS WELL --

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:52.568 region:rollup2
THAT UNIT WILL BE AS AGAIN

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:54.037 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT FROM EITHER HOUSE.

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:55.204 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:56.906 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT AND

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:58.708 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION SO EVERY INCIDENT

01:07:56.906 --> 01:08:00.076 region:rollup2

OR WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:05.715 region:rollup2

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:08.651 region:rollup2
OF SERIOUS SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:10.486 region:rollup2
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE

01:13:08.651 --> 01:13:13.122 region:rollup2

01:13:38.214 --> 01:13:40.716 region:rollup2
RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM WHAT'S

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:42.585 region:rollup2
BEEN DONE IN THE PAST.

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:43.686 region:rollup2
HAVING AN OUTSIDE GROUP MAKING

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.454 region:rollup2
THE DETERMINATIONS OF WHETHER

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:47.223 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A VIOLATION OF POLICY

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:48.891 region:rollup2
IS PRETTY RADICAL.

01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:50.726 region:rollup2
HAVING ALSO THEY'RE MAKING

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:51.827 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HOPEFULLY

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:54.964 region:rollup2
WILL BE FOLLOWED IN MOST

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:56.766 region:rollup2
INSTANCES IS ALSO A BIG CHANGE

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:59.235 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE

01:13:56.766 --> 01:14:01.070 region:rollup2
NEED TO GIVE THE PERCEPTION OF

01:13:59.235 --> 01:14:03.306 region:rollup2
FAIRNESS TO EVERYBODY. TO HAVE A

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:04.473 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT OPERATES THE SAME

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:06.042 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S A MEMBER OF THE

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:08.110 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OR A STAFFER THEY

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:09.245 region:rollup2
WILL GO DOWN THE EXACT SAME TRAP

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:12.748 region:rollup2
WITH THE EXACT.

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:14.950 region:rollup2
SAME TYPE OF PROCESS --

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:16.953 region:rollup2
A I THINK IT'S A FAIR POLICY AND

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:18.754 region:rollup2
HAVING THAT INDEPENDENT UNIT

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.855 region:rollup2
WITH OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS WHO

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:21.891 region:rollup2
ARE UNDER CONTRACT THE

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:23.826 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE BUT NOT EMPLOYEES OF

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:25.795 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE --

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:27.296 region:rollup2
WITH EXPECTATIONS WITH WRITTEN

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:29.498 region:rollup2
RIGHT WITHIN THEIR CONTRACT OF

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.866 region:rollup2
THE TYPE OF UNBIASED AND FAIR

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.967 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS THAT WE EXPECT

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.502 region:rollup2
THEM TO MAKE.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:35.404 region:rollup2
I THINK SHOULD GIVE EVERYBODY

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:37.073 region:rollup2
THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE SET

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:38.841 region:rollup2
UP A FRAMEWORK THAT'S INTENDED

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:40.643 region:rollup2
TO BE FAIR --

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:42.645 region:rollup2
TO EVERYBODY WITH THE RIGHT

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:43.679 region:rollup2
BALANCE OF DISCLOSURE AND

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.214 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY FOR OUR

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:47.049 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:48.617 region:rollup2
I'M WITHOUT I WILL SEE IF MY

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.952 region:rollup2
VICE CHAIRS ANYTHING TO ADD

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:51.454 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:52.021 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IN A CONDENSED

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:55.124 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME IN THE MUGGLE

01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:58.427 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:59.595 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WOULD?

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:01.163 region:rollup2
MADAM CHAIR YOU MENTION THAT

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:02.164 region:rollup2

AND SOMETHING NEW IN TERMS OF

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.533 region:rollup2
THE PANEL I JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:05.968 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT AND THAT MEMBERS

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.203 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD THAT IT'S WE'VE

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:09.205 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT A EXISTING.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:09.739 region:rollup2
ALL THE LA COUNTY.

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:11.474 region:rollup2

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:15.378 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS THE IMPANELED

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:16.712 region:rollup2
MAKING THE DECISION ABOUT

01:15:15.378 --> 01:15:18.681 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE'S BEEN A A

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:20.750 region:rollup2
VIOLATION OF OUR POLICY AND THEN

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:21.917 region:rollup2
MAKING THE RECOMMEND RECOMMENDED

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:24.253 region:rollup2
RESPONSES.

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:26.422 region:rollup2
ON LA COUNTY INSTITUTED THIS

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:27.823 region:rollup2
MODEL MANY YEARS AGO HAVING TO

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:28.758 region:rollup2
DO WITH A CULTURE PROBLEMS THAT

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:30.059 region:rollup2
THEY HAD IN THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:31.894 region:rollup2
DIVISIONS.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:33.362 region:rollup2
I AND THEN IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:35.564 region:rollup2
IN PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THEY

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:37.500 region:rollup2
ROLLED OUT ACROSS THEIR ENTIRE

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:38.968 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE WHICH IS A HUNDRED

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.935 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EMPLOYEES STRONG.

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:42.304 region:rollup2
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT LA

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:43.739 region:rollup2
COUNTY IS THAT THEY HAVE A VERY

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:45.141 region:rollup2
DIVERSE WORKFORCE THEY HAVE.

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:46.475 region:rollup2
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS THAT MAY

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:47.877 region:rollup2
HAVE FIVE PEOPLE ARE PUBLIC

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.345 region:rollup2
SAFETY DIVISIONS THAT ARE OUT IN

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:50.780 region:rollup2
A RURAL PART OF LA COUNTY WITH

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:51.347 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE OF PEOPLE.

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:54.550 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY HAVE HOSPITALS

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:55.651 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT HAVE TEN PLEASE SO

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.487 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE FOUND THAT THIS

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:59.922 region:rollup2
PROCESS WORKS ALL ACROSS THOSE

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:01.590 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT VARIED WORK FORCES AND

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:02.491 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT DISTRICT OFFICES THAT

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.426 region:rollup2
ARE SMALL OUT ON THE FIELD AND

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:05.027 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT.

01:16:03.426 --> 01:16:08.030 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE BUILDING HERE.

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:09.465 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:11.133 region:rollup2
A VERY BROAD POLICY THAT COVERS

01:16:09.465 --> 01:16:13.335 region:rollup2
A VERY BROAD RANGE OF

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:15.137 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT AND THEY

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:16.839 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY ASK ALL OF THEIR

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:18.507 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WHETHER SUPERVISORS

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:19.875 region:rollup2
ARE NOT TO REPORT THOSE.

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:21.043 region:rollup2
THEY FIND THAT THEY'RE IN THE

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:22.711 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S AN

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:24.079 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:25.347 region:rollup2
HAS REALLY INCREASED

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.549 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS AND

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.783 region:rollup2
IN FACT.

01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:29.618 region:rollup2
I WENT DOWN TO WATCH THE PANEL

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:30.719 region:rollup2
AND I SAW A CASE WERE EMPLOYEES

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:32.421 region:rollup2
WHO WERE NOT EVEN YOU KNOW HIGH

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:33.956 region:rollup2
LEVEL SUPERVISORS NEW THE

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.257 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO MUCH THAT ONE

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:37.960 region:rollup2
INCIDENT OCCURRED.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:39.028 region:rollup2
THE IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN EACH

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.729 region:rollup2
ROAD UP A NEW GUY A SORT OF AN

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:42.131 region:rollup2
AFFIDAVIT OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED

01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:42.932 region:rollup2
SO THAT LATER ON THERE WOULDN'T

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.934 region:rollup2
BE ANYONE.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:46.235 region:rollup2
RE REMEMBERING WHAT HAPPENED AND

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.970 region:rollup2
THEY WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:49.338 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND THAT'S THE BEGINNING

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:50.306 region:rollup2
OF CULTURE CHANGE BECAUSE WHEN

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:52.208 region:rollup2
YOUR EMPLOYEES START TO

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:53.809 region:rollup2
INTERNALIZE THIS.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:55.411 region:rollup2
AND START THINKING TO THEMSELVES

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:57.046 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A VIOLATION OF CONDUCT

01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:58.314 region:rollup2
MAYBE I SHOULD INTERVENE MAYBE I

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:59.982 region:rollup2
NEED TO TALK TO THAT PERSON

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:00.616 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN AND

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:02.084 region:rollup2
WRITE.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:03.886 region:rollup2
RIGHT THIS INCIDENT UP AND SEE

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:05.588 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A VIOLATION THAT'S WHEN

01:17:03.886 --> 01:17:07.056 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY BIG BEGIN TO HAVE

01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:08.691 region:rollup2
THAT CULTURE CHANGE SO THEY'VE

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:10.759 region:rollup2
HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS --

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:13.195 region:rollup2
DOING THIS OVER THE PAST I THINK

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:14.663 region:rollup2
IT'S FIFTEEN YEARS AND WE WERE

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:16.899 region:rollup2
VERY IMPRESSED NO OF COURSE THE

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:18.100 region:rollup2
POLICY HAS BEEN TAILORED TO OUR

01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:19.535 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE BECAUSE WE ARE

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:21.270 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WERE VERY TOP HEAVY.

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:23.072 region:rollup2
WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE IS

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:24.106 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE FIVE SUPERVISORS IN

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:25.841 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER ELECTED

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:27.610 region:rollup2
IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:38.087 region:rollup2
SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT A BIT.

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:38.654 region:rollup2
BUT THAT BASIC TENANT OF AN

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:39.255 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT PANEL BIT OF OF

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:39.889 region:rollup2
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. TO

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:40.556 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE AND ADJUDICATED WE

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:41.157 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND

01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:41.824 region:rollup2
FIT VERY WELL WITH WITH OUR

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:44.927 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT AND THE ONLY THING I

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:46.061 region:rollup2
WOULD ADD IS THAT THE THE POLICY

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:47.963 region:rollup2
APPLIES TO THE ELECTED BOARD OF

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:48.230 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS TO THAT'SWHAT WE

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:50.132 region:rollup2
THOUGHT.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:51.600 region:rollup2
ONLY LOOKED AT MODELS ACROSS THE

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:53.302 region:rollup2
COUNTRY THAT IT --

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.304 region:rollup2
WAS GERMANE TO OUR EXPERIENCE

01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:59.275 region:rollup2
WITH A PLACID EMPLOYEES.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:59.575 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:03.112 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:04.747 region:rollup2
CENTER MONEY.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:05.848 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I ALSO

01:18:04.747 --> 01:18:06.415 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO APPLAUD THE CO

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:08.517 region:rollup2
CHAIRS IN THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:09.785 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.921 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT HISTORIC WORK

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:13.322 region:rollup2
IN.

01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:14.623 region:rollup2
NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH BUT

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:15.824 region:rollup2
LEARNING FROM OTHER

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:17.026 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS PARTICULARLY LOS

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:18.727 region:rollup2
ANGELES [inaudible]

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.896 region:rollup2
IN.

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:23.265 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING AT PAGE FIVE ON THE

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:23.966 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED POLICY.

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:26.669 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ONE OF THE

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:27.403 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WITHOUT GETTING TOO

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:29.605 region:rollup2
MUCH IN THE WE'D SPENT.

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:31.941 region:rollup2
OF MOVING FORWARD OF EDUCATING

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:33.976 region:rollup2
STAFF THERE IS KIND OF A GRAY

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:35.611 region:rollup2
AREA OF THE ABILITY [inaudible]

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:37.413 region:rollup2
TO ASSURE.

01:18:35.611 --> 01:18:39.848 region:rollup2
AND ACCUSER OR WITNESS OF

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:42.151 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY --

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:42.985 region:rollup2
AND IN THE LANGUAGE REFLECTS

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:46.388 region:rollup2
THAT -- YOU

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:48.390 region:rollup2
DO HAVE A LEGISLATURE CANNOT

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:50.326 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE CONFIDENTIALITY BUT IT

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.393 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:52.461 region:rollup2
THE CONFIDENTIALITY FOR THE LAW

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:54.530 region:rollup2
ALLOWS [inaudible]

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:56.665 region:rollup2
SO.

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:58.500 region:rollup2
IN THE TRAINING I THINK WE NEED

01:18:56.665 --> 01:19:00.936 region:rollup2
TO BACK SOME OF THIS RECOMMENDED

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.871 region:rollup2
POLICY INTO TRAINING.

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:05.140 region:rollup2
REALIZING THERE STILL MAY BE A

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:07.610 region:rollup2
GRAY AREA THAT COULD STILL

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:10.980 region:rollup2
SERVICE A RESTRAINT.

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:12.548 region:rollup2
FOR EITHER A VICTIM OR A WITNESS

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.849 region:rollup2
TO FEEL FULLY COMFORTABLE COMING

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:15.050 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:16.752 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE IS SOME

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:18.087 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BETWEEN.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.588 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES GET RELEASED

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:22.558 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY TO THE PUBLIC IF IT'S

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:24.393 region:rollup2
A HIGH RANKING STAFF MEMBER OR

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:25.794 region:rollup2
LEGISLATOR --

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:28.364 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TRY TO ASSURE THE

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:30.1000 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY THE COMPLAINANT.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:33.902 region:rollup2
THAT IF IF THE ACCUSED NAME

01:19:30.1000 --> 01:19:35.371 region:rollup2
BECOMES PUBLIC AS A MATTER OF

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:36.939 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY IN [inaudible]

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:39.108 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY [inaudible]

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:40.876 region:rollup2
THAT ME [inaudible]

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:43.312 region:rollup2
UNINTENTIONALLY.

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:45.114 region:rollup2
REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF AT LEAST

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:46.582 region:rollup2
A GROUP OF EMPLOYEES SO I DON'T

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:48.817 region:rollup2
HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THAT I THINK

01:19:46.582 --> 01:19:50.285 region:rollup2
YOU FLAGGED.

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:51.920 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE ON THE ONE HAND WE

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:53.489 region:rollup2
WANNA.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.056 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT TRANSPARENCY FOR

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:56.225 region:rollup2
CERTAIN LEVEL OF COMPLAINTS

01:19:54.056 --> 01:19:58.394 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:59.528 region:rollup2
IT DOES GET SHARED WITH A

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:00.729 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO PROTECT

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:02.831 region:rollup2

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:08.203 region:rollup2
I THINK WHO IN THE TRAINING

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.071 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE --

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:10.839 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE DO EVERYTHING WE

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:13.075 region:rollup2

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:15.511 region:rollup2
FOR IT SOUGHT.

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:57.559 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS ARE AND WHAT WE AS

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:16.445 region:rollup2
KINDA LEADS TO SOME.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:19.715 region:rollup2
KIND OF ANIMOSITY AS WELL FOR

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:21.316 region:rollup2

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:32.060 region:rollup2
AFFECTS PEOPLE WANTING TO

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:33.929 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS JUST

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:35.097 region:rollup2
SOME THOUGHTS ON ON THAT.

01:25:33.929 --> 01:25:38.500 region:rollup2
YEAH CLOSER ON THE REALLY

01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:40.402 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AFTER UNDERSTAND THAT

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.737 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

01:25:40.402 --> 01:25:42.504 region:rollup2
SO EXPERIENCES ARE NOT --

01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:44.039 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND

01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:45.073 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN A

01:25:44.039 --> 01:25:46.541 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE YOU DON'T FEEL

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:48.276 region:rollup2
SAFE OR WERE YOU FEEL THAT

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.778 region:rollup2
YOU'RE REALLY VISION EMOTIONALLY

01:25:48.276 --> 01:25:51.013 region:rollup2
ABUSED OR HARASSED.

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:52.180 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THERE AS

A STAFFER AND YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.883 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BE

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:56.718 region:rollup2
TELLING A SUPERVISOR ABOUT.

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:57.953 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT YOU I'M I

STAFF IS REALLY GIVEN THAT KIND

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.696 region:rollup2

RECEIVES ONE HOUR CONSULTATION

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:15.944 region:rollup2
BUT ON THAT IS CURRENTLY IT SO

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:16.711 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST ONE ITEM.

01:35:15.944 --> 01:35:18.246 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO GET BETTER FOR

CLARIFICATION --

01:35:18.246 --> 01:35:23.351 region:rollup2
IT IS OUR EXPECTATION --

01:35:21.983 --> 01:35:25.353 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT'S FRAME BASED ON THE

01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:26.921 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS THAT THE

01:35:25.353 --> 01:35:28.289 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT UNIT.

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:30.091 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE NOW BUILDING AS A

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:31.993 region:rollup2
RESULT THAT THAT WILL SERVE --

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:33.061 region:rollup2
BOTH HOUSES.

01:35:31.993 --> 01:35:35.496 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:36.931 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE AND THE

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:39.100 region:rollup2
LION'S SHARE OF THE

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:43.571 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:44.772 region:rollup2
BUT IF IT'S JUST BEING CANDID

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:47.408 region:rollup2
CULMINATING AT LONDON'S ON THE

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:48.076 region:rollup2
LINE HERE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:49.277 region:rollup2
YES WE ARE CLEAR THAT FOR SOME

01:35:48.076 --> 01:35:51.179 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS WILL STILL HAVE

01:35:49.277 --> 01:35:53.181 region:rollup2
TO GO OUTSIDE COUNSEL --

01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:54.749 region:rollup2
THIS POLICY ASYLUM ON THAT THAT

01:35:53.181 --> 01:35:58.253 region:rollup2
IS A NEW ISSUE THAT WILL AGAIN

01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:58.253 region:rollup2
PUT IN THE AND THE PARKING LOT I

01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:02.023 region:rollup2
BOTH HOUSES PERHAPS IS COMMITTEE

01:35:59.654 --> 01:36:02.957 region:rollup2
WILL NEED TO ADDRESS BUT IT'S

01:36:02.023 --> 01:36:04.058 region:rollup2
NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE TALKED

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:06.494 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:08.963 region:rollup2
ON IN BUILDING THIS NEW POLICY.

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:10.898 region:rollup2
OUR DESIRE WAS.

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:13.534 region:rollup2

WE HAVE A BIT OF A KNEE JERK

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:18.106 region:rollup2
REACTION OVER THE LAST YEAR.

01:36:16.838 --> 01:36:19.507 region:rollup2
AND BASICALLY FARMED EVERYTHING

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:24.479 region:rollup2
OUT EXTERNALLY.

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:26.714 region:rollup2
IN OUR EFFORT TO GIVE THE IT.

01:36:24.479 --> 01:36:28.416 region:rollup2
IT HEIGHTENED PUBLIC CONFIDENCE

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:30.451 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY

01:36:28.416 --> 01:36:32.287 region:rollup2
INVALIDITY OF THE INVESTIGATIONS

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:35.456 region:rollup2
WE'RE CLEAR BASALLY EXPERTS WE

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:36.924 region:rollup2

BUT AGAIN WE HOPE WILL DO THE

01:36:43.231 --> 01:36:47.535 region:rollup2
LINE SHARE SO WE'VE HEARD YOU IT

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:49.003 region:rollup2
WAS NOT A PART OF THE POLICY AT

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:50.738 region:rollup2
THAT'S DEATHLESS AT THAT WILL

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:52.507 region:rollup2
HAVE TO CONSIDER NO NINE AND I

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:53.675 region:rollup2

01:39:45.613 --> 01:39:49.717 region:rollup2
APPRECIATION TO OUR CHAIRS AND

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:51.586 region:rollup2
TO THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR THE

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:53.621 region:rollup2
WORKING TO THE STAFF.

01:39:51.586 --> 01:39:55.323 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION IS.

01:39:53.621 --> 01:39:56.190 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T SO MUCH TALK ABOUT

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:56.724 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:59.093 region:rollup2
IN ITS NOT SO MUCH IN THE

01:39:56.724 --> 01:40:01.629 region:rollup2
POLICY.

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:02.563 region:rollup2
AND I REALIZE THAT EACH SETTING

01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:03.798 region:rollup2
CAST TO BE --

01:40:02.563 --> 01:40:06.834 region:rollup2
EACH SITUATION [inaudible]

01:40:03.798 --> 01:40:08.035 region:rollup2
ON WOLF.

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:11.339 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE REMEDY IS WILL BE

01:40:08.035 --> 01:40:11.939 region:rollup2
UNIQUE TO THAT SITUATION BUT

01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:12.240 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M REFERRING TO US WHAT

01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:14.508 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.110 region:rollup2
ONCE SOMETHING'S BEEN

01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:17.512 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED.

01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:18.179 region:rollup2
AND IT SUSTAINED.

01:40:17.512 --> 01:40:20.548 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT THEN ARE THE

01:40:18.179 --> 01:40:21.849 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES AND WE TALKED A

01:40:20.548 --> 01:40:22.450 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRAINING SO

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:25.920 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WITHIN OUR OWN STAFF

01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:27.421 region:rollup2
--

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.656 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE --

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:31.425 region:rollup2
SOME TYPE OF INTERVENTIONS LIKE

01:40:28.656 --> 01:40:33.528 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I WAS STRUCK BY.

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:36.264 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEE SURVEY WHERE WOULD

01:40:33.528 --> 01:40:37.665 region:rollup2
INDICATE AT LEAST FROM THOSE WHO

01:40:36.264 --> 01:40:39.467 region:rollup2
RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY.

01:40:37.665 --> 01:40:42.403 region:rollup2
THAT THERE.

01:40:39.467 --> 01:40:44.071 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO BE A HIGHER INCIDENCE

01:40:42.403 --> 01:40:45.039 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTERNAL YES

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:47.008 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER WORDS BEING HARASSED

01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:49.410 region:rollup2
BY A SALE LOBBYIST REPUBLIC NO

01:40:47.008 --> 01:40:51.846 region:rollup2
HARD BILLION HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:53.114 region:rollup2
ON A PUBLIC IS A LITTLE

01:40:51.846 --> 01:40:54.282 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO HIM SAYING A

01:40:53.114 --> 01:40:55.950 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OFFICE IT WOULDN'T BE

01:40:54.282 --> 01:40:58.452 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO IN EFFECT

01:40:55.950 --> 01:41:00.354 region:rollup2
BEYOND THEM FROM ATTENDING ART

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:03.658 region:rollup2
TOO SHOWING UP AT OUR DISTRICT

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:04.792 region:rollup2
OFFICES NEW --

01:41:03.658 --> 01:41:05.960 region:rollup2
BUT WITH LOBBYIST WHAT.

01:41:04.792 --> 01:41:07.862 region:rollup2
DID THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED AT

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:09.530 region:rollup2
ALL WHAT TYPE OF REAL REMEDIES.

01:41:07.862 --> 01:41:11.666 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT HAVE IN THOSE

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:13.367 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:41:11.666 --> 01:41:14.669 region:rollup2
WE WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:16.137 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:16.737 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL WITHOUT KNOWING

01:41:16.137 --> 01:41:18.506 region:rollup2
LEGALLY WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:19.774 region:rollup2
DO.

01:41:18.506 --> 01:41:22.310 region:rollup2
I IT'S HARD TO HAVE THE

01:41:19.774 --> 01:41:23.544 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AND WE YOU KNOW WE

01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:25.079 region:rollup2
JUST HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT

01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:26.714 region:rollup2
YET CERTAINLY THAT'S A TOPIC FOR

01:41:25.079 --> 01:41:27.982 region:rollup2
ONGOING DISCUSSION I WILL SAY

01:41:26.714 --> 01:41:29.350 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HAD THE SUGGESTION

01:41:27.982 --> 01:41:30.985 region:rollup2
COME IN FROM SOME.

01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:32.253 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE LOBBY CORPS.

01:41:30.985 --> 01:41:34.121 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PERHAPS WE SHOULD

01:41:32.253 --> 01:41:35.556 region:rollup2
EXPLORE AND THIS IS GONNA SOUND

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:37.625 region:rollup2
RADICAL AND I HOW I CAN JUST SAY

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:38.993 region:rollup2
THIS WITHOUT HAVING SPOKEN TO

01:41:37.625 --> 01:41:40.027 region:rollup2
VERY MANY PEOPLE.

01:41:38.993 --> 01:41:43.030 region:rollup2
ASKING OF SOME OF THOSE

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:45.533 region:rollup2
LOBBYISTS WOULD SUBJECT

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:46.534 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES TO OUR PROCESS SO

01:41:45.533 --> 01:41:48.102 region:rollup2
THAT IF AN ALLEGATION OF AN

01:41:46.534 --> 01:41:49.270 region:rollup2
INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO GET UP

01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:50.471 region:rollup2
FOR A LOBBYIST.

01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:51.872 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY WOULD COME IN FRONT

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:52.773 region:rollup2
OF THE SAME PANEL IN FRONT OF

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:54.508 region:rollup2
OUR PANEL.

01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:56.811 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:58.312 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SUBJECT HIMSELF TO THAT

01:41:56.811 --> 01:41:59.647 region:rollup2
WILLINGLY WE CAN'T FORCE THEM.

01:41:58.312 --> 01:42:01.349 region:rollup2
TO THE PANEL CAN STILL

01:41:59.647 --> 01:42:03.384 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE.

01:42:01.349 --> 01:42:06.754 region:rollup2
A CLAIM LIKE THAT --

01:42:03.384 --> 01:42:07.321 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER

01:42:06.754 --> 01:42:07.688 region:rollup2
OR NOT THEY WOULD WANT TO

01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:09.323 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE --

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:10.925 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES YOU WANT THE OTHER

01:42:09.323 --> 01:42:12.126 region:rollup2
SIDE GIVING THEIR POINT YOU KNOW

01:42:10.925 --> 01:42:14.028 region:rollup2
THE WHAT THE SUBJECT TO BE ABLE

01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:17.131 region:rollup2
TO RESPOND WE CAN'T FORCE THEM

01:42:14.028 --> 01:42:17.765 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT THIS POINT.

01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:20.468 region:rollup2
BUT THESE ARE ALL THINGS TO BE

01:42:17.765 --> 01:42:24.672 region:rollup2
EXPLORED YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD.

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:27.942 region:rollup2
SO THAT DOES RAISE.

01:42:24.672 --> 01:42:28.909 region:rollup2
CAN'T FORCE THEM.

01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:31.212 region:rollup2
WE WOULD STILL DO THE

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:31.712 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION BUT THEN WE WOULD

01:42:31.212 --> 01:42:35.683 region:rollup2
ONLY BE IF IF THE PERSON

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:36.817 region:rollup2
ACCUSED.

01:42:35.683 --> 01:42:39.153 region:rollup2
DID NOT INTERACT WITH OUR

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:45.226 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS WE WOULD ONLY HAVE

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:47.695 region:rollup2
THE VERSION OF OUR OWN STAFF --

01:42:45.226 --> 01:42:53.601 region:rollup2

01:42:53.601 --> 01:42:57.505 region:rollup2
THERE IS SEE PLAY I DON'T WANT

01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:59.540 region:rollup2
TO EVEN SAY A HIGH LIKELIHOOD

01:42:57.505 --> 01:43:01.142 region:rollup2
RIGHT I JUST WANNA SAY IFS.

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:02.243 region:rollup2
ENOUGH STAFF OF EXPERIENCE THAT

01:43:01.142 --> 01:43:03.944 region:rollup2
THAT THEY RESPONDED IN THE

01:43:02.243 --> 01:43:06.747 region:rollup2
SURVEY.

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:10.184 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO FEEL SATISFIED.

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:13.587 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE CREATING A WORKPLACE

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:15.523 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN FEEL SAFE.

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:19.360 region:rollup2
WE WILL NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND

01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:21.195 region:rollup2
OF YEP.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.030 region:rollup2
WE WE WILL IN AND I THINK EVEN

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:25.666 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF THE

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:26.434 region:rollup2

THE DISK WITH THE PANEL WERE

01:43:26.434 --> 01:43:28.836 region:rollup2
DETERMINED THAT THERE'S A HIGH

01:43:27.702 --> 01:43:30.771 region:rollup2
LIKELIHOOD THAT IN.

01:43:28.836 --> 01:43:32.073 region:rollup2

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:38.813 region:rollup2
CAN BE DONE IN TERMS OF NOT

CERTAIN MEMBERS BE CERTAIN

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.983 region:rollup2

THAT'S NOT BEEN UNHEARD OF IN

01:43:44.485 --> 01:43:47.154 region:rollup2
THIS BUILDING SO EVEN WITHOUT

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:10.544 region:rollup2
SURE THAT IN POLICY.

01:44:08.676 --> 01:44:11.946 region:rollup2
WERE PREPARED SO THAT PEOPLE

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:13.314 region:rollup2

01:44:17.818 --> 01:44:20.321 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL?

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:21.722 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE

01:44:20.321 --> 01:44:23.023 region:rollup2

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:34.435 region:rollup2

01:45:00.094 --> 01:45:05.166 region:rollup2

SURFACED AS A RESULT OF THE

01:45:08.536 --> 01:45:11.839 region:rollup2
CLIMATE SERBIAN THEM AS A RESULT

DEVELOPING POLICIES AS A RESULT

01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:27.087 region:rollup2
--

01:45:25.052 --> 01:45:28.689 region:rollup2
THAT WAS VERY TELLING AND WE

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:29.690 region:rollup2
JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ITS NOT

01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:32.259 region:rollup2
ALL BUT WE ARE CLEAR THAT IT'S A

01:45:30.958 --> 01:45:34.161 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IN IN I THINK

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:35.863 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY AS THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:36.897 region:rollup2

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:41.068 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE IT YET.

01:45:38.032 --> 01:45:43.037 region:rollup2
BUT I HOPE THAT THAT ALL STAFF

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:45.506 region:rollup2
WILL RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF A

01:45:43.037 --> 01:45:46.140 region:rollup2
CLIMATE SURVEY IN COMMUNICATING

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:55.649 region:rollup2
WOULD WE WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:57.518 region:rollup2

01:45:57.518 --> 01:46:00.721 region:rollup2
LOBBYIST OR LOBBYIST'S HARASSES.

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:02.156 region:rollup2
SOMEONE IN THE BUILDING THE

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:03.757 region:rollup2

STAFFORD COMPLAINTS IT'S

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:05.793 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED.

01:46:05.159 --> 01:46:07.962 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER OR NOT THE LOBBYIST

01:46:05.793 --> 01:46:10.297 region:rollup2

01:46:07.962 --> 01:46:11.966 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATED OR NOT THE

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:13.434 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION FEELS THAT THE

01:46:11.966 --> 01:46:15.736 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMPLAINT IS

01:46:13.434 --> 01:46:18.672 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE [inaudible]

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:19.807 region:rollup2
THAT CIRCUMSTANCE ONCE WE FACE

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:22.076 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE WOULD THINK ABOUT

01:46:19.807 --> 01:46:24.578 region:rollup2
COGNOS SO WE SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT

01:46:22.076 --> 01:46:26.213 region:rollup2
ABSENT IN TERMS OF IF I MAY ON

01:46:24.578 --> 01:46:27.214 region:rollup2
THAT WORD OBSERVATION JUST AS

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:28.882 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO SAT THROUGH THEIR

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:31.085 region:rollup2

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:33.821 region:rollup2
IT BEFORE YOU GO SHOPPING.

01:46:31.085 --> 01:46:35.022 region:rollup2
I THINK THE POINTTHAT SENATOR

01:46:33.821 --> 01:46:35.956 region:rollup2
MITCHELL HIGHLIGHTED THE HIGH

01:46:35.022 --> 01:46:38.892 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT OF OUR

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:40.327 region:rollup2

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:42.263 region:rollup2
ASSET TO OUR ORGANIZATION AS WE

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:43.964 region:rollup2

01:46:42.263 --> 01:46:46.066 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A A

01:46:43.964 --> 01:46:46.767 region:rollup2
REDIRECTION INSTITUTION REFORM

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:48.235 region:rollup2
IN THE ROAD.

01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:49.637 region:rollup2
TAKE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:50.905 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE HIGH LEVEL OF

01:46:49.637 --> 01:46:52.273 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT.

01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:54.975 region:rollup2
COUPLED WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO

01:46:52.273 --> 01:46:56.910 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:57.845 region:rollup2

REALLY WANT TO TAKE THAT

01:46:57.845 --> 01:47:01.582 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT AND HAVE EVERYONE

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:03.183 region:rollup2
KIND OF OWN THESE ISSUES.

01:47:01.582 --> 01:47:04.318 region:rollup2
AND STARTED SO MY QUESTION JUDGE

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:05.619 region:rollup2
IN SO MUCH AS TO WHETHER THE

01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:07.755 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE FEEL SATISFIED AS MUCH

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:08.889 region:rollup2
AS IT'S WHETHER WE HAVE A REMEDY

01:47:07.755 --> 01:47:11.892 region:rollup2
FOR THAT EXTERNAL.

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:13.494 region:rollup2
HARASSER SO AT AT WHAT WE'RE

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:15.696 region:rollup2
ASKING TODAY IS THAT THE

WHICH IS THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK.

01:47:19.566 --> 01:47:22.936 region:rollup2
THE WORK IS NOT DONE.

01:47:21.702 --> 01:47:23.537 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS THIS IS A

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:25.673 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK OKAY THERE'S STILL

01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:27.174 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE AT

01:47:25.673 --> 01:47:28.542 region:rollup2
THE STAFF LEVEL --

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:29.576 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THROUGH THROUGH

01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:32.012 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE FROM --

THIS IS A FALLS IN THE MEAT ON

01:47:35.049 --> 01:47:37.551 region:rollup2
THE BONES CATEGORY FOR ME AND

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:39.119 region:rollup2
THE SKINNER.

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:41.322 region:rollup2

COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:12.953 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE A LITTLE MORE A FEW

01:48:11.018 --> 01:48:14.755 region:rollup2
MORE QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA HEAR

01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:15.289 region:rollup2

01:48:25.933 --> 01:48:27.935 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS WHEN YOU MAKE A POINT

01:48:26.633 --> 01:48:29.103 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT IN EVERY OF THE SORT

01:48:27.935 --> 01:48:30.371 region:rollup2
OF GENERAL CONSENSUS HERE.

01:48:29.103 --> 01:48:31.205 region:rollup2
THEIR HEARING US THAT

01:48:30.371 --> 01:48:32.172 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE COUNCILS THEY

01:48:31.205 --> 01:48:33.774 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THIS YOU'RE HEARING US

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:35.409 region:rollup2
AND KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT A PART

01:48:33.774 --> 01:48:36.677 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM. TO

01:48:35.409 --> 01:48:37.878 region:rollup2
NOW FLUSH OUT AND I THINK THAT

01:48:36.677 --> 01:48:40.481 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HEARD VERY CLEARLY FROM

01:48:37.878 --> 01:48:40.914 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OF YOU THAT THAT POINT

01:48:40.481 --> 01:48:42.816 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:48:40.914 --> 01:48:43.684 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO WITH OUTSIDE PEOPLE

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:44.685 region:rollup2
IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY NEED TO

01:48:43.684 --> 01:48:45.352 region:rollup2
REALLY --

01:48:44.685 --> 01:48:47.121 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S AN

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:48.889 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF THE POLICY IN

01:48:47.121 --> 01:48:50.257 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S PUT IN PLACE AS SOON

01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:51.558 region:rollup2
AS WE CAN SO THAT IT'S READY TO

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:54.395 region:rollup2
GO IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THAT

01:48:51.558 --> 01:48:55.963 region:rollup2
SHOULD COMMON [inaudible]

01:48:54.395 --> 01:48:57.598 region:rollup2
SENATOR ROTH.

01:48:55.963 --> 01:49:00.300 region:rollup2
YOU MISTER CHAIR --

01:48:57.598 --> 01:49:01.535 region:rollup2
DURING THE PRESENTATION YOU.

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.037 region:rollup2
I'VE KNOWLEDGE THAT OBVIOUSLY --

01:49:01.535 --> 01:49:04.138 region:rollup2
ES COMPLAINTS COMMENCEMENT WILL

01:49:03.037 --> 01:49:06.206 region:rollup2
PERTAIN TO HARASSMENT

01:49:04.138 --> 01:49:09.576 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION AND SOME WILL NOT

01:49:06.206 --> 01:49:10.878 region:rollup2
SO AS WE YOU WE TRIAGE.

01:49:09.576 --> 01:49:13.781 region:rollup2
THESE COMPLAINTS AND

01:49:10.878 --> 01:49:15.282 region:rollup2
COMPLAINANTS AND REFER THEM.

01:49:13.781 --> 01:49:17.584 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE YEAR THE INDEPENDENT

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:19.286 region:rollup2
UNIT AND HR OR PERHAPS SOME

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:20.521 region:rollup2
OTHER OFFICE.

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:21.422 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE

01:49:20.521 --> 01:49:23.290 region:rollup2
RISKS THAT --

01:49:21.422 --> 01:49:26.927 region:rollup2
SOME WILL DROP TO THE CRACKS.

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:28.228 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ARE --

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:30.731 region:rollup2
TO ONE HOW HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT

01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:32.266 region:rollup2
THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN AND TO WHO

01:49:30.731 --> 01:49:33.600 region:rollup2
DO WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE.

01:49:32.266 --> 01:49:35.502 region:rollup2
FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.904 region:rollup2
COMPLAINANT SMOOTHLY TRANSITION

01:49:35.502 --> 01:49:38.405 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS BETWEEN THE

01:49:36.904 --> 01:49:40.441 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT UNIT.

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:41.675 region:rollup2
OF THE VARIOUS HR OFFICES AND

01:49:40.441 --> 01:49:42.843 region:rollup2
PERHAPS SOME OTHER OFFICE THAT

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:44.144 region:rollup2
SET UP.

01:49:42.843 --> 01:49:45.779 region:rollup2
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO THAT

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:47.281 region:rollup2
WHENEVER AN INCIDENT COMES INTO

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:48.449 region:rollup2
THE UNIT --

01:49:47.281 --> 01:49:50.217 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:49:48.449 --> 01:49:51.819 region:rollup2
AMERICAN NATION IS THAT IT'S THE

01:49:50.217 --> 01:49:53.821 region:rollup2
PANEL ITSELF THAT ACTUALLY

01:49:51.819 --> 01:49:54.421 region:rollup2
EVALUATES EACH OF THESE TAKES A

01:49:53.821 --> 01:49:55.789 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT AND SAYS SOMETHING

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:56.690 region:rollup2
THAT THEY MIGHT SEE SOMEONE LIKE

01:49:55.789 --> 01:49:58.058 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT EVEN IF THIS IS

01:49:56.690 --> 01:49:59.226 region:rollup2
ALL TRUE THIS DOES NOT FALL

01:49:58.058 --> 01:50:00.761 region:rollup2
UNDER OUR PURVIEW THIS REALLY.

01:49:59.226 --> 01:50:02.396 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO GO TO HR BECAUSE THIS

01:50:00.761 --> 01:50:03.530 region:rollup2
IS JUST PEOPLE NOT GETTING ALONG

01:50:02.396 --> 01:50:06.700 region:rollup2
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:08.101 region:rollup2
SO THE PANEL WOULD BE THE ONE TO

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.636 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO BE

01:50:08.101 --> 01:50:11.238 region:rollup2
HEARING THE CASE DURING THE

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:12.539 region:rollup2
INCIDENT ADJUDICATING IT OR

01:50:11.238 --> 01:50:14.241 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S GOING TO GO BACK TO

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:15.742 region:rollup2
HR ONCE THEY SEND IT OFF.

01:50:14.241 --> 01:50:18.345 region:rollup2
I WOULD EXPECT THIS SORT OF THAT

01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:20.247 region:rollup2
THAT HR IF IT GOES TO HR THAT

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:21.615 region:rollup2
BILL ON THE DO WHATEVER FOLLOW

01:50:20.247 --> 01:50:22.850 region:rollup2
UP EVALUATION THEY NEED TO DO

01:50:21.615 --> 01:50:24.151 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY'LL NEED TO ISSUE A

01:50:22.850 --> 01:50:25.686 region:rollup2
LETTER AT SOME POINT TO THE

01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:27.354 region:rollup2
COMPLAINING PARTY.

01:50:25.686 --> 01:50:29.656 region:rollup2
WHERE THE REPORTING PARTY TO AS

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:30.891 region:rollup2
WE SAID THAT THAT RESPONSE BACK

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:32.559 region:rollup2
TO THE PERSON WHO REPORTS THE

01:50:30.891 --> 01:50:33.794 region:rollup2
INCIDENT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:35.095 region:rollup2
MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE THAT

01:50:33.794 --> 01:50:36.463 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST?

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:38.031 region:rollup2
THIS INDEPENDENT UNIT THAT DOES

01:50:36.463 --> 01:50:40.100 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF RESPONSE THAT HR

01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:42.202 region:rollup2
ALSO IS TASKED WITH RESPONDING

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.070 region:rollup2
ON EACH UNIT LIKE THAT THAT

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:45.739 region:rollup2
COMES INTO.

01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:47.207 region:rollup2
MY EACH INCIDENT THAT COMES AND

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:48.675 region:rollup2
I ASSUME THAT IS WE WE'RE NOT

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:49.743 region:rollup2

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:51.078 region:rollup2

FROM THE INDEPENDENT.

01:50:59.553 --> 01:51:03.590 region:rollup2
UNIT TWO HR TO HR TO SOME OTHER

ASSEMBLY RULES COMMITTEE SO

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:37.310 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY THAT ONE

I SEE THAT IS TRYING.

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:45.718 region:rollup2
TO CONFRONT THIS ISSUE OF POWER

02:03:42.515 --> 02:03:47.053 region:rollup2
