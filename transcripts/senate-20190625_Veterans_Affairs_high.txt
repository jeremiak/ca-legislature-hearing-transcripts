I DO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AS I KNOW WE ALSO HAVE OTHER MILITARY MEN HERE -- AND WOMEN. THAT HAVE SERVED SO WANT TO THANK YOU -- I WANT TO BEGIN WITH GOING BACK BACK INTO HISTORY. WHICH IS. JUNE SIXTH NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AS MANY OF US KNOW ANA. THIS IS BEEN CALLED D. DAY ON THE DAY THAT OUR YOUNG. MILITARY MEMBERS AND OUR ALLIES STORMED THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY. AND WAS HAS BEEN CALLED THE TURNING POINT IN WORLD WAR TWO THOSE MEN -- STORM THAT BEACH MANY OF THEM WERE LOST AND YET SOME OF THEM HAVE RETURNED AND THAT GENERATION THE GREAT GENERATION. AT THOSE MEN ARE NOW AND LATE EIGHTIES TO NINETIES AT NINETY YEARS OLD NINE MID NINETIES WE KNOW THAT ALMOST EVERY DAY WE LOSE ANOTHER. A GREAT VETERAN OF THAT TIME AND NOT JUST THE WORLD WAR TWO BUT ALL OF THE VETERANS THAT HAVE SERVED US. IN MANY. AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD VIETNAM KOREA. AND SO FORTH. WITH THAT A COALITION OF VETERANS CAME TOGETHER WELL OVER A DECADE AGO AN ORANGE COUNTY I TO START TO DREAM TO PURSUE THE IDEA. OF AN ORANGE COUNTY OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS CEMETERY OF THE CEMETERY. THERE WAS NOT A SPECIFIED PLACE IN WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN TWENTY TWELVE I I HAD JUST. READ AN ARTICLE MATTER FACT FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER. AND WAS VERY COMPELLED BY THEIR STORY TO BRING ASOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS CEMETERY TO ORANGE COUNTY AND WITH THAT AS I WAS THE VETERANS CHAIR AT THAT TIME. AND MET WITH THE CONSULTANT IN IN LOOKED INTO THAT THEY SAID WELL YOU NEED. TO MEET FIND OUT INFORMATION AND AND PURSUE I AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID. AND WE MET I MET WITH THE LOCAL VETERANS WITH THE COALITION AT THAT TIME AND LEARNED ABOUT THEIR OZELL. TO LOOK AT THE GREAT PARK. FOR A SPECIFIC SITE WHICH IS CALLED THE ARTIST SITE AND THAT ARTIST SITE MEANT QUITE A BIT TO THEM AS FAR AS NOT ONLY THAT LOCATION BUT THE HISTORICAL. SIGNIFICANCE I ACTUALLY WENT OUT TO VISIT THAT SITE -- TO WITH THE MILITARY MAN A BILL COOK -- SAT RIGHT NEXT TO ME TO PRESENT THE BILL AND HE'S HERE AND HE'LL BE PRESENTING ALONG AT TODAY. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT. THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME AND I KNOW MEANT A LOT TO THEM WAS TO MOVE FORWARD. THAT -- PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAY BACK IN I BELIEVE TWENTY THIRTEEN AB. FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE ART SO TO GIVE YOU THE HISTORY OF WHAT HAPPENED THEN ON MARCH ELEVENTH. TWENTY FOURTEEN IRVINE CITY COUNCIL BY UNANIMOUS VOTE THE EXIT NEEDED THE ARTIST SITE. AT THE GREAT PART AS THE BEST POSSIBLE SITE FOR A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK IN CEMETERY. AT THAT TIME CRISTINA SHEA. WHO WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER AND NOW IS THE MAYOR? DON WAGNER WHO WAS A SUPERVISOR BUT IS NOW A WHO WAS A SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND IS NOW A FOR A SUPERVISOR FOR ORANGE COUNTY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEVEN CHOI WHO WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER AND NOW ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND FORMER MAYOR LARRY A GRAN AS WELL AS FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER AT BASCOM VOTED FIVE ZERO TO NAME THE ARTIST SITE AS A PLACE. FOR VETERANS CEMETERY AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LATER THE COUNCIL EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO OFFER A THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR. FUND TO MATCH WITH THE STATE WAS ROPOSING AND THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THEN MAYOR JEFF LOWELL AWAY WHO IS NOT ON COUNCIL. ANYMORE HISTORY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE STATE LEGIS LEGISLATURE SUPPORTS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK IN CEMETERY. PREVIOUS LEGISLATION SELECTED THE ARTISTS SITE AND ALLOW YOU AT ALLOCATED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE CALVET CEMETERY AND MISTER CHAIR THIS IS THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PRESENTED. ALL OF THE SITE IN MAPS AND ANALYSIS SO THIS IS THE TYPE OF ANALYSIS THAT THINK CAL THAT DOES -- THEY ARE EXTREMELY SERIOUS AND VERY METHODICAL ON THEIR NALYZING A PROPERTY TO BE A STATE RUN VETERANS CEMETERY. LATER ON WITHIN A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT ON AN ALTERNATE SITE WAS DETERMINED A SITE THAT WE SHOULD LOOK INTO AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY. FOR A LACK OF A FORMAL NAME CALLED THE STRAWBERRY FIELD AND THIS WAS OFFERED AS PART OF THE LAND SWAP AND MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM ACTUALLY VOTED TO FUND THAT SO AS A WILLING LET THIS ON MY PART AS THE AUTHOR. WHEN THERE WAS ANOTHER SITE THAT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD WE ALSO MOVE TOWARDS THAT SITE WARNING TO DO WHAT WE FELT THAT THE PEOPLE OF IRVINE WANTED -- AND THAT WAS UP WE MOVE TOWARDS LOOKING AT THAT SITE TO SITE WE ALSO PUT UP AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS STILL IN THE CALVET SITE. HELL THAT ACCOUNT. IT BUT ALSO SUBTRACTING THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST ANALYSIS SO YOU CAN SEE THIS KING START TO GET TRICKY IF YOU'RE NOT. REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT WATCHING. HOW THIS MOVE FORWARD A LOCAL REFERENDUM WHICH ARGUED AGAINST THE STRAWBERRY SITE? AND WAS ARGUING TO LOOK BACK AT THE ORIGINALSITE WAS SUCCESSFUL THIS ACTION STOPPED THE LAND SWAP. THE LAND SWAP TO THE STRAWBERRY SITE. AND PLACED IT BACK AT THE ORIGINAL SITE. MANY VOTERS BELIEVED THAT'S WHAT THE REFERENDUM DID THE REFERENDUM ACTUALLY DID NOT PLACE IT BACK ACT THE ARTIST SITE THAT'S WHAT OUR LEGISLATION INTENDS TO DO -- SO THERE HAS BEEN LOTS OF NEWS ARTICLES MANY PIECES OF OPINION A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH THING BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY TO EVERYBODY HERE. IS. WE WANT A CEMETERY. I THINK THERE'S A 100% AGREEMENT THAT NOT ONLY DOES THE VETERANS COMMUNITY WANNA CEMETERY. PEOPLE IN IRVINE WANNA CEMETERY THE ARGUMENT HAS BEEN WHERE SO THERE HAS BEEN THE FIRST SITE ARTIST SITE. THE SECOND SIDE THE STRAWBERRY SITE AND NOW A THIRD SITE THE GOAL SITE. NOW JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THE GOAL SITE IS ACTUALLY NOT A GULF SITE SO IN MY MIND WHEN YOU SAY GOLF YOU'RE GONNA THINK OF ROLLING GREEN HILLS AND A WATERED AREA AND IT'S NICE AND READY JUST. TO THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT A GOLF SITE IT'S MUCH LIKE THE ARTIST SITE AS FAR AS CONCRETE AND SO FORTH IT WAS NEVER MADE INTO. A GOLF SITE BUT THAT BEING SAID THERE HAS BEEN A 100% CONSISTENT VOICES IN THAT. UP THERE WE WANT DAIS CEMETERY THE DEVELOPER THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS MAYORS HAST IN PREVENT PRESENT HAVE ALL AGREED THAT THE BIG CONFLICT IS WHERE. SO ALL OF PROCLAIM THEIR SUPPORT FOR A VETERANS CEMETERY YEP PARTIES HAVE YET TO FORMALLY OR OFFICIALLY IDENTIFY ONE SITE THAT DEVELOPS THE NECESSARY CONSENSUS. SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE BECOMES NECESSARY TO PRESS FORWARD MOVE FORWARD TO GET TO THE POINT WE WANT TO GET. TO THAT. EIGHTEEN WITH NEW MEMBERS HERE -- NEW MEMBER SENATOR TOM UMBERG -- ALSO MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOM DALY WHO ALL HAS WORKED ON THIS CONSISTENTLY SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE AND OTHER REPUBLICANS ASSIGNING. SUPPORTERS REPUBLICAN MEANING A SIMILAR YOU MEMBER PHILLIP CHEN SENATOR LING LING CHAN. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BILL BRO ALL HAVE SIGNED ON TO THIS LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR THE ARTIST SITE. SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO TODAY IS MAKE THE CASE TO YOU THAT OUR LANGUAGE FROM THE ORIGINAL SITE THE CHANGE TO THE ARTIST SITE. BUT AND TERE'S MORE BUT WE WILL ALSO WANT TO COMMIT. HONESTLY AND WHAT DOES MUCH TAKE YOUR INTEGRITY AS WE CAN SAY THAT ALTHOUGH. WE'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD WITH NO AMENDMENTS WE WILL BE HAPPY TO IMMEDIATELY START IN CONVERSATIONS. THAT CAN BRING THE CONSENSUS TO A 100% SO THAT WE DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S A WINNER OR LOSER IN THIS CONVERSATION. SO WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS. PATRICK. FUSS GO. OF WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OFFICER OF FUSS GO ENGINEERING OF IRVINE AND A LONG TIME PROPONENT OF THAT OF THE VETERANS CEMETERY IN IRVINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN. AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ARCHULETA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M FLATTERED AND I'D LIKE TO JUST ADD TO MY INTRODUCTION I'M THE CEO FOUNDER OF A TWO HUNDRED PERSON. ENGINEERING FIRM WE MAKE THINGS WORK. WE HAVE TOP TIER CLIENTS THE IRVINE COMPANY COSCO. MY THIRD LARGEST CLIENT IS ROSE HILLS THE LARGEST CEMETERY OPERATOR IN THE STATE SO I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT LAND DEVELOPMENT AND CEMETERY. SO HOPEFULLY YOU'LL FIND MY REMARKS CREDIBLE. SO -- I PASSED OUT FOR YOU THERE -- BASICALLY A SUMMARY OF MY FINDINGS I WAS RETAINED. BY ONE GROUP TO ASSESS ALL THREE SITES. IT JUST AS AN ENGINEER. TOTALLY -- AGNOSTIC POLICE IN NEW TRULY TO ASSESS THE THREE SITES AND GIVEN THE MERITS AND ISSUES OF EACH. SO I DID SO I LIKE TO SAY I'M LIKE JOE FRIDAY FROM DRAGNET. IT'S JUST THE FACTS MA'AM. SO THAT'S ALL I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU NOW IN THIS LETTER THAT I'M. PASSED OUT TO YOU IS A LOT OF THE STUFF I FOUND AND I'M SORT OF CHEATING GIVING YOU THAT IT'S A LETTER TO A CLIENT I HAD TO REDACT THEIR NAME OUT. SO FORGIVE ME FOR THAT. ALSO IT ADDRESSES A FORCED SITE WHICH IS IRRELEVANT TO YOU GUYS IT'S AN ANAHEIM SO JUST IGNORE THAT PART OF IT. AND FINALLY THERE IS A LITTLE UPDATE ON PAGE TWO AT THE BOTTOM ON THE GOLF SITE AS IT'S REFERRED TO THE RUNWAYS HAVE BEEN REMOVED. AND IT SAYS ON THERE THEY'RE STILL THERE SO THAT'S OTHER THAN THAT IT'S ALREADY PRETTY RELEVANT AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT USEFUL SO HERE'S MY FINDING. WHY I'M HERE? THE ARTIST SITE. HAS THE STATE APPROVAL AND HAS THIS FULL DESIGN REPORT WHICH YOU SAW A MINUTE AGO WHICH IS. ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO IN THE MAKING SO YOU'RE ALREADY ON SECOND BASE WITH NO OUTS ON THE SITE. IT'S READY TO GO IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION CAN BE. DEMOLISHED CLEARED BUILT AND DELIVERED IN TWO YEARS. TAKE IT TO THE BANK TWO YEARS. ALSO THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING CERTAINLY TO ME HOPEFULLY DO YOU ITS ASPIRATIONAL BUT THIS IS THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL FLIGHT LINE. NINETEEN FORTY THREE IT WAS BUILT AT THE AIR BASE IT'S STILL THERE. THE HANGERS ARE THERE ON THE CONTROL TOWER WE LOVE TO SAVE THAT. AND MAKE IT A PART OF THIS VETERANS CEMETERY ON MEMORIAL PARK. THIS THAT MAKES THIS SITE UNIQUE THERE ARE NO OTHER SITES THAT HAVE THAT. IN IN IN A CAN'T BE REPLICATED. SO WHY NOT TRY TO SAVE IT AND MAKE IT OF A LEGACY OF THE MEN WOMEN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM THE WENT THROUGH THERE MANY OF THEM WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE WAR. THERE'S BEEN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT CONTAMINATION I WAS INTRODUCED. HAVING WORKED ON THIS PROPERTY FOR TEN YEARS I KNOW WE'RE ALL THE SITES OF THE CONTAMINATION ARE. I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM WE HAVE MAPS OF THEM. WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF THEM THEY'RE NOT THAT BIG A DEAL FRANKLY. BUT WE CAN SET ASIDE SOME MODEST CONTINGENCY BUDGETS FOR ANY CONTAMINATION SAY THEY CAN BE ACCOMMODATED IN PLACE THEY CAN BE ENCAPSULATED OR YOU CAN JUST SIMPLY REMOVE THEM [inaudible] FINALLY. THIS SITE IS HAS A GREAT SHAPE TO IT IT CAN BE FULLY UTILIZE FOR SIXTY THOUSAND GREAT SITES. IT'S GOT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ITS FRONT DOOR. AND THERE'S NO HABITAT ON THE SITE AND THE SEEK WERE APPROVALS ARE IN PLACE. SO TO ME THIS IS JUST A NO BRAINER FOR PLAY. BUT LET'S GO ON TO THE OTHER SIDE -- THE THE IRREGULAR SHAPE OF WHAT'S CALLED THE GOLF COURSE SITE SHOULD JUST IMMEDIATELY STIFFENED YOU UP JUST LOOK AT THE PICTURE OF THE SHAPE OF IT. IMAGINE TRYING TO DEVELOP ANYTHING ON IT. IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM IT'S GOT LONG NARROW LEGS. IT'S GOT A FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOOT. PERFECT CIRCLE RADIUS SENATE THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE. TO MANAGE EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE CONCENTRICALLY WITH THIS CURVE SO RIGHT AWAY THAT THAT IS A BIG MINUS FOR THAT SITE. SECONDLY THE FAA ANTENNA STILL THEIR OPERATING HAS A FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOOT RADIUS AROUND IT OF A DEAD ZONE IT'LL ALWAYS BE A DAD'S ON IT'LL BE WEEDS FOR EVER. THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK AT FROM THAT SITE. THIRD THE ACCESS TO THAT SITE IS A LITTLE BIT LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN TO THE ARTIST SITE BECAUSE IT'S SHARED. IT'S CALL BOSQUE DRIVE AND KATE INSTRUMENT SHARED BY THE RESIDENCES ARE ALREADY LIVING THERE. SO -- OOPS. HAVE PEOPLE COMING AND GOING TO THE MEMORIAL PARK IN THE CEMETERY. SOME TURN LEFT INTO THEIR DRIVEWAY SOME TURN RIGHT INTO THE CEMETERY NOT SO GOOD. WHEREAS THE ARTIST SITE HAS IT -- SON WAY WHICH IS A COLLECTOR THERE'S NO HOUSES ON GO STRAIGHT IN. AND FINALLY -- IF YOU GO TO THE GOLF SITE FOR WHATEVER REASON I CAN'T IMAGINE. YOU'RE STARTING OVER SO YOU HAVE TWO YEARS TO CATCH UP TO THE ARTIST SITE. AND BY THE WAY SOMEONE ASKED ME SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT COSTS. ON THE CEMETERY SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO DO THE CEMETERY. SITE. AND I'LL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU [inaudible] THANK -- I I I KNOW [inaudible] BRING UP. THE BILL PLEASE. THE STATE YOUR NAME LYFT. LOG CLEAR AND ALSO YOUR COMPANY YOUR UNIT. I AM HARVEY LISTS A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CIVIL ENGINEER A RESIDENT OF IRVINE. FOR FORTY THREE YEARS. AND I AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OTHER IRVINE RESIDENTS SENT EMAILS TO ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THERE. VOCIFEROUS SUPPORT. FOR GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SITE EARLY. SURE IN AT THE CEMETERY IS BUILT ON THE ORIGINAL SITE. THE ART ASIDE AND THEY GIVE THEIR HEARTFELT REASONS WHY THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ACTUALLY IN THOSE EMAILS THEY WERE ALL. WRITTEN BY THESE FOLKS WHO ARE EXTREMELY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. AND SO WE ADVOCATE PASSING ME THESE THREE SIXTY EIGHT WITHOUT ANY AMENDMENT AT ALL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PAT RIGHT THERE IN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE VETERANS ALLIANCE OF ORANGE COUNTY. WE SUPPORT THE BILL -- WE ALSO -- LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- ON THE BILL. AND TO TRY AND GET THE CEMETERY BUILT I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME THE CLIENT THAT WE REPRESENT ON THIS -- THINKS IT'S LONG OVERDUE AND WE HOPE TO GET THIS DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU GIVE ME SAID YOU YOU'D CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THAT MEANS WITH. ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MANY ADJUSTMENTS AT THAT THE LEGISLATURE THE AUTHOR OF THE PROPONENTS OR WHOEVER -- DECIDE -- TO YOU KNOW IF IF IF THERE. DECIDED TO BE MADE TO THE WE WOULD CERTAINLY. WORKING WITH THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. TAKE YOUR NAME AND THE UNIT YOU'RE WITH FOR COMPANY IF YOU WISH [inaudible] GOOD. LIGHT THAT OVER. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHASING AND SOLVE THIS REPRESENTING THE CITY OF IRVINE. JUST AT THE OUTSET TO BE CLEAR WE CONCUR WITH EVERYTHING THE AUTHOR IT SAID. THE CITY OF IRVINE IS NOT OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THE CITY OF SUPPORT DATES BACK. TO TWENTY FOURTEEN PERHAPS TWENTY TWELVE WAS THE ORIGINAL ACTION BUT THE PASSAGE OF AB. FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE IT HAS CONTINUED TO BE STE AND STEADFAST SUPPORT OF GETTING A VETERAN CEMETERY DEVELOP CONSTRUCTED -- AND OPERATING IN. THE CITY OF IRVINE. WITH THE CITY'S POSITION AS A SUPPORT WITH AMENDMENTS. AND THE CITY'S REQUEST FOR THE AMENDMENT IS THEY FEEL THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY JUST TAKING WHAT THE ORDER NUMBERS WERE. IN THE CITY'S ATTEMPT TO JUXTAPOZ THOSE NUMBERS. THEY THINK THE GOLF COURSE COULD BE ABOUT A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR ENDEAVOR. WE'RE NOT WET TO THOSE NUMBERS WE DON'T SUGGEST. THAT'S WHAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE BUT THERE'S NOT SEVENTY SEVEN BUILDINGS TO TEAR DOWN THE THE RUNWAYS ARE REMOVED FROM THE PROPERTY LOT OF THE MEDICATION HAS BEEN DONE. AND WITH THE TWENTY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE AUTHOR. THE ORANGE COUNTY DELEGATION YOURSELF MISS CHAIR THE SUPPORT THAT'S BEEN. HERE FROM THE STATE THAT SHOULD BE COMMENDED COUPLED WITH WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT. AND AND I KNOW MISTER CHAIR YOU HAVE A LETTER TO THAT EFFECT -- WE THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUNDING TO BE IN PLACE. AND WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT. ALL INDICATIONS FROM STATE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT THE TWENTY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. ON A NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLAR. ARTIST SITE WE CAN'T GET MOVING THE FEDERAL VA HAS INDICATED TO THE CITY YOU HAVE TO THE TITLE OVER TO THE STATE MOTOR START THIS PROCESS. SO WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING FOR IS FOR THE LEGISLATION LIKE THEY DID WITH ARDOR. TO SPECIFY ARE TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO DO A STUDY OF OUR NUMBERS ARE OFF. THEN WE'LL KNOW WHAT OUR NUMBERS ARE BUT IT'S ABOUT A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR STUDY. AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. AN AMENDMENT TO THAT EFFECT. WITH THAT I HAVE P. CARMICHAEL WITH ME FROM THE CITY OF IRVINE HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT I'D LIKE. TO TURN OVER TO KEEP OR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- BEFORE YOUR DIRECTION WANTED CLARIFY YOU'RE NOT. OPPOSED TO HAVING IT IRVINE I MEAN THE THE CEMETERY IN IRVINE YOUR YOUR WHAT DO YOU LOW WANT TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. IT MIGHT COME TOGETHER THE CITY HAS TO THIS IS A PROPERTY AND THE CITY HAS CLEARLY STATED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE VETERANS CEMETERY. WHETHER IT'S THE ARTIST SITE OR THE GOLF COURSE SITE THEY WILL DEEDED OVER ONCE THE FUNDING IS IN PLACE AND THAT'S TO KEEP PEACE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DEAL OVER. THE PROPERTY. IF IT'S NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR AND A HALF. THE THE OTHER PIECE ON THE GOLF COURSE THE SHAPE THE GENTLEMAN WAS ACT WITH THE SHAPE IS. MISSILE DOES HAVE A CIRCULAR SPHERE IN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT BUT IT'S ALSO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT ACRES. THE FEDERAL VA TELLS US WE NEED A HUNDRED ACRES SO WE THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE STUDY. IS A STUDY IT MAY BE A VIABLE PROJECT THAT BLUE FORD. SOONER THAN LATER AND NOT HAVE A SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FUNDING GAP. SOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU. PLEASE A POINT OUT YOUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE SHEER TIME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS PETE CARMICHAEL. AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF OF PLANNING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WITH CITY OF IRVINE I'VE JUST A REAL BRIEF SET OF PREPARED REMARKS WITH REGARD. TO SOME OF THE THE THOROUGH DUE DILIGENCE THAT CITY STAFF HAS DONE IN THE CITY OF IRVINE. AND SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACTS SURROUNDING THE VARIOUS SITES IN THE CITY FIELD AND TOLD TO MINUTE HERE. ON JULY SIXTEENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MYSELF AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF WITHIN THE CITY OF IRVINE WHEREAS BY MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL TO REVIEW WHAT HAS COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE GOLF COURSE SITE. WITHIN THE FORMER EL TORO MARINE BASE AND WITHIN THE ORANGE COUNTY GREAT PARK AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE A. R. D. A SITE. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE THOROUGHLY REVIEWED BOTH SITES THROUGH PRIMARY PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH AS WELL AS THROUGH EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE VA. CAL THAT AND OTHER EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. WE BROUGHT THESE FACTS BEFORE THE CITY'S TRANSPORTATION PLANNING COMMISSION BOTH OF WHICH RECOMMENDED THE GOLF COURSE SITE OVER THE A. R. D. A SITE AS THE SUPERIOR LOCATION FOR A NEW CEMETERY. I'M A BRIEFLY WALK THROUGH JUST A COUPLE OF FACTS AS TO WHY WE BELIEVE THE COMMISSION'S ARRIVED AT THIS CONCLUSION SO QUICKLY. FIRST AND FOREMOST -- WE LEAVE THE ARE THEY ALREADY A SITE IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE. BASED ON THE OWN REPORT COMMISSIONED BY CAL THAT THE COST FOR THE A. R. D. A SITE IS NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. USING THAT SAME METHODOLOGY STAFFS ESTIMATE FOR THE COST TO CONSTRUCT THE GOLF COURSE SITE IS FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. THE REASON FOR THE COST DIFFERENTIAL IS FAIRLY CLEAR. THE GOLF COURSE SITE HAS BEEN CLEARED OF ALL INFRASTRUCTURE. ON TRADE WHAT YOU HEARD PREVIOUSLY ALL CONCRETE RUNWAY BUILDINGS TAXI WAYS -- WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MEET REMEDIATION OF THE SOIL IN PLACE. THE A. ALREADY A SITE HAS OVER SEVENTY FIVE BUILDING STILL STANDING ON SITE. EXTENSIVE UNDERGROUND UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE RUNWAY TAXI WAYS AND THE ASSOCIATED. KNOWN AND IMPORTANTLY UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON THAT SITE -- WITHIN LAST WEEK FIVE POINT COMMUNITIES HAS COMMITTED TO CONTRIBUTING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO CEMETERY CONSTRUCTION ON THE SITE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE IT'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS LESS EXPENSIVE TO START WITH SO. FIRST POINT BEING THE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS WE BELIEVE TO BE THERE FOR THE GOLF COURSE SITE. A SECOND HAS TO DO WITH TIMELY AS WE BELIEVE THAT. THE GOLF COURSE SITE AGAIN BECAUSE IT MUCH OF THE REMEDIATION IS ALREADY BEING COMPLETE CAN BE CONCLUDED MORE QUICKLY. DEMOLITION REMEDIATION HAS BEEN CALLED COMPLETED FOR THE GOLF COURSE SITE I THIS IS YET TO BE UNDERTAKEN FOR THE A. R. D. A SITE. I IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT CONCEPT PLAN HAS INDEED BEEN PREPARED FOR THE A. R. D. A SITE WE ESTIMATE THE GOLF COURSE SAY CAN BE COMPLETED. APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS SOONER GIVEN ALL HE DEMOLITION REMEDIATION IT'S ALREADY TAKEN PLACE. I WITH THAT JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER CONCERNS I WANNA I WANNA RAISE -- FIRST BEING -- IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT SOME OF THE BUILDING STILL STANDING ON THE A. R. D. A. SITE MAYBE HISTORIC. ACCORDING TO THE VA ALL HISTORIC STUDIES WOULD NEED TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE THE STATE. A FURTHER AND AGAIN ACCORDING TO WHAT WE HEARD JUST THIS WEEK FROM THE VA. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE THE STATE UNTIL THE ENTIRE SITE IS REMEDIATED MEETING A PHASED APPROACH THAT WOULD LEAVE THOSE BUILDINGS IN PLACE -- WOULD LIKELY NOT BE FEASIBLE. SECOND POINT -- A. R. D. A SITE IS BISECTED BY PRIMARY ROADWAY -- ALTHOUGH NOT A DISQUALIFIER ACCORDING TO THE VA THEY DO SPECIFICALLY LISTA PREFERENCE FOR UNIFORMS SITES. UNDIVIDED BY ROADWAYS ARE EASEMENTS. GOLF COURSE SITE HAS NO SUCH ENCUMBRANCES. OUR UNDERSTANDING THE FEDERAL GRANT PROCESS IS THAT IT IS VERY CAN. AND AGAIN WHILE A SITE BEING DIVIDED BY ROADWAYS NOT NECESSARILY DISQUALIFIER -- WE BELIEVE THE DIVIDED NATURE OF THE A OR D. A SITE WOULD BE INFERIOR TO THE CONTIGUOUS UNIFORM SHAPE OF THE GOLF COURSE SITE. AND ONE LAST POINT -- THE RT SITE HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO OPPOSITION THE COMMUNITY. THE A SIDE ACROSS THE STREET FROM A CASE RIGHT SCHOOL. YOUR MIND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SUBMITTED A LETTER JUST LAST WEEK -- EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERNS OVER THE SITE. ASKING THE CEREMONIES INVOLVING THE TWENTY ONE GUN SALUTE OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS NOT BE ALLOWED DURING SCHOOL HOURS. THE GOLF COURSE SITE HAS HAD NO SUCH OPPOSITION AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SENSITIVITY SINCE HE'S THE SCHOOLS ARE RESIDENTS. IN SUMMARY I WE ESTIMATE THAT THE ATA SITE IS SOME THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. THIS COUPLED WITH THE OFFER OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS RENDERS THE SITE NEARLY SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE GOLF COURSE I FURTHER THE AIR DECIDE AS POTENTIAL STORE CALLED DESIGNATION. DIVIDED PSYCH COMPLICATIONS MAKING IT LESS COMPETITIVE FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT. WELL THE GOLF COURSE SITE FALLS SQUARELY WITHIN FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND LASTLY THE GOLF COURSE. EIGHT DOES NOT HAVE THE COMMUNITY IN SCHOOL DISTRICT CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED IN WRITING FOR THE A OR D. A SITE. IN CLOSING CHAIRMAN ARCHULETA HONORABLE SENATORS BASED ON THESE FACTS OUTLINED ABOVE WHEN THE CITY OF IRVINE AND CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERS THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH. CITY STAFF WILL BE RECOMMENDING THAT THE CITY OFFER THE GOLF COURSE EIGHT TO THE STATE AS DISAPPEAR CHOICE FOR THE VETERANS CEMETERY. THANK YOU HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS. THE RECORD THE NUMBER OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE CITY MANAGERS AND SO ON THAT ARE -- CLOSER OR OR FOR THE SITE YOU HAD MENTIONED THE GULF WAR TYPE. THANK YOU KNOW HARD TO SAY THAT AS I MENTIONED THIS IS COMING BEFORE THE COUNCIL WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH WHILE THE CLEAR PICTURE I KNOW CERTAINLY -- OUR MAYOR IS VERY MUCH FOR THE SITE AND I BELIEVE OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE -- BUT IN ALL HONESTY BEFORE THERE'S A VOTE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH I DON'T THINK I CAN. THE ACCOUNT AT THIS POINT OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT THE INDIVIDUAL TO OPPOSE. MY NAME IS BILL KHó KHN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ORANGE COUNTY VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK FOUNDATION. MY CONNECTION WITH MCA SL TORAH GOES BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHEN I WAS A TWENTY YEAR OLD MARINE SERGEANT [inaudible] BROUGHT A BUSLOADS OF FRESHLY TRAINED TEENAGERS UP FROM CAMP PENDLETON LOAD THEM ONE AIRCRAFT AND WE FLEW OFF TO VIETNAM TOGETHER. FROM THAT SITE THAT WAS THE LAST PLACE MANY THOSE YOUNG BOYS STAR LIVE ON AMERICAN SOIL. I HAVE A PASSION FOR THIS PLACE. WHEN I RETURNED FROM VIETNAM I SERVE MY LAST DAYS IN THE MARINE CORPS THERE? PULLED OUT THAT MAIN GATE WE DO. APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA HAS DONE FORCE. WE CAME TOGETHER AS A COALITION OF PEOPLE FROM NORTH COUNTY ARE LITTLE LACK LOS AMIGOS MANY VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE AMERICAN LEGION [inaudible] AND PUT VETERANS CEMETERY BACK IN THE VOCABULARY OF ORANGE COUNTY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA WHO WE HAVE. THE IMMENSE GRATITUDE FOR AND WITH. BROUGHT FORWARD AB. FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE AND GOT US A VETERANS CEMETERY ESTABLISHED IT IN IN THE ESTABLISH THE WOULD BE A VETERANS CEMETERY IN ORANGE COUNTY [inaudible] WE APPRECIATE -- CONTINUED LOYALTY TO WORK BECAUSE MY BRING FORWARD AB. THREE SIXTY EIGHT I WOULD URGE YOU TO MOVE AB THREE SIXTY EIGHT FORWARD. I WOULD PLEAD WITH YOU TO MOVE IT FORWARD OUR GOAL IS THE ORANGE COUNTY VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK FOUNDATION IS A VETERANS CEMETERY. ON OLD MCAS EL TORO. THE BEST WE CAN GET. AND THE SOONEST WE CAN GET IT. I HEARD YOU TO MOVE FORWARD BUT WITH AN AMENDMENT. I WOULD URGE YOU TO DELETE THE REFERENCE TO THE ORDER IN THE GREAT PART THE ART IS NOT. IN FACT IN THE GREAT PARK AT ALL. GIVEN MY DRUTHERS WHEN WE WERE SEARCHING FOR SITES WAY BACK WHEN. AT THE AREA OF THE GOLF COURSE BEEN AVAILABLE. IT WAS NOT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WHERE I WANT TO PUT MY FINGER WHERE WOULD YOU WANT TO THE VETERANS CEMETERY DAHLE [inaudible] RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT PARK. RIGHT INSIDE THE MAIN GATE RIGHT PAST ME INSIDE RIGHT ON THE RUNWAY RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT PARK ON MCAS EL TORO BUT WASN'T AVAILABLE. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME WE'VE HAD. ALTERNATE SITES PRESENTED. AND DEFEATED YOU HAVE THAT IN YOUR INFORMATION PACKETS. WE NOW HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FUNDING THAT WOULD COME FORWARD. WITH. THREE SIXTY EIGHT WITH THE GENEROUS COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTION OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM FIVE POINT. TWO IS ALREADY SPENT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN AMENITIES IN THE GREAT PARK. WE CAN BUILD CEMETERY WE CAN DO IT NOW -- THE NEIGHBORS DON'T LIKE THE ORDER I BEEN THERE YOU CAN STAND ON THE ART OF LOOKING THE BEDROOM WINDOWS. THEY HAVE CULTURAL CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WE TRY TO ADDRESS WHEN WE MOVED TO STRAWBERRY FIELDS. THE SCHOOLS DON'T LIKE THE ARDA YOU IMAGINE. VETERANS CEMETERY WITH NO RIFLE SALUTES. I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THAT -- CVM P. IS REALLY NOT FAVORABLE. TO THE OUR SITE. HAS BEEN STATED THERE IS A ROAD THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH IT. THIS ROAD WILL WILL RUN THROUGH VETERANS CEMETERY. FROM RESIDENCES TO HIGH SCHOOL. I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE INTERRED NEXT TO THAT WROTE [inaudible] AT ALL. IT ALSO HAS WHAT WAS OMITTED FROM THE STONE WAS REPORT. A PERMANENT FAA ARRAY A VERY TALL ANTENNAS THAT STANDS NEXT TO THE OLD TOWER. EVEN IF YOU TO MOSTLY OLD TOWER THAT IN TERNARY WOULD STAND. WE FEEL THAT THE OUR SITE IS OVERLY EXPENSIVE. AND NOT COMPLETELY ADEQUATE. FOR OUR DESIRES AS A VETERAN SENATOR. IN LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE THIS AND IN YOUR IN YOUR PACKAGE. YOU WOULD SEE ALMOST A COMPLETE SAVINGS ARE ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO SPEND ON A VETERANS CEMETERY OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. WE WOULD PREFER THAT YOU TAKE THAT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE NEEDS OF A LIVING VETERANS. SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO MOVE THREE SIXTY EIGHT FORWARD BUT AMENDED TO DELETE THE REFERENCE TO THE ORDER AND REPLACE IT WITH THE GOLF COURSE RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SURE. NEXT THE INDIVIDUAL. WHO IS IN OPPOSITION? THANK YOU SENATOR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE. BOB LOCHNER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THE POINT WE MADE IN THE LETTER WE SENT LAST WEEK -- FIRST OF ALL WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR BEING SO AMENABLE TO OUR CONCERNS WHICH ARE VERY VERY BRIEF AND I THINK EASILY ADDRESSED. AS YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS OF SCHOOL EVERY YEAR. THAT'S LESS THAN HALF OF DAYS OF THE YEAR -- AND DURING THE REGULAR SCHOOL HOURS WERE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED THAT THE DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS. WILL BE UPSETTING TO THE SCHOOL DAY AND AND ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF DESENSITIZING THE COMMUNITY SHOULD THERE ACTUALLY BE. ALIVE SHOOTER WE HAVE ACT. GRILLS IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE REALITY SOAK UP THE THAT THE AUTHOR STAFF OF BEEN WONDERFUL WE DON'T THINK THERE'S NECESSARILY A PROBLEM IN ADDRESSING THIS WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MORATORIUM. ON GUN FIRE DURING THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAY -- THAT LEASE WEEKENDS HOLIDAYS SUMMERS ALL SORTS OF TIMES. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERY OF A FUNERAL AS GUNFIRE IT HAS TO BE REQUESTED AND I WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD BE PRETTY EASY TO SAY IF YOU WANT THAT THESE OF THE HOURS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- THE LETTERS IN FRONT OF YOU THANK YOU. GOOD. ARE THERE ANY ONE NOW -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IT'S NOT AN OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND I BELIEVE -- UP -- SAN RAFAEL [inaudible] OR THOMAS. OR DO YOU USE IN YOUR IF YOU LIKE. WELL I DON'T DOES MATTER I CAN HAS MY QUESTIONS AND THEN. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN THIS SO YOU CAN CLOSE IT OUT. JUST TO CLEAR UP ONE ISSUE OF TO THE TO THE ENGINEER SIR DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE V. O. R. ON THE SIDE YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT FEEL OURS. IN SCHEDULED FOR DECOMMISSIONING BY THE FAA I TRIED DESPERATELY TO GET THEM TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S OUR TECHNOLOGY AS YOU ALL KNOW. YES. PLEASE PICK UP SORRY I GPS IS OBVIATED. THERE'S A LIST YES AND IT O THE LIST ON IT LAST I CHECKED YEARS AGO IT WAS WAY DOWN THE LIST. SO DONALD IT'S ON A DE COMMISSIONING LAST SUNDAY YES OKAY WHICH WE DON'T KNOW WHEN. NOT FOR A LONG TIME WELL I DON'T KNOW NEXT GEN. GETTING A PILOT DIRECTION MOVES ALONG SO. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE STUDIED CORRECT. YES IT WOULD BE WORTH LOOKING INTO. SO LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION DOES THIS I GUESS OF THE AUTHOR DOES THIS BILL TAKE ANY AUTHORITY. AWAY FROM THE CITY OF IRVINE TO MAKE THE LAND USE TERMINATION THIS CASE AND THAT IS. TO THE SITE THE CEMETERY. AT THE ARTIST SITE OR DECIDED AT THE GOLF COURSE SIDE OR FRANKLY DECIDED SOMEWHERE ELSE WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS -- AS WAS NOTED -- THE COUNCIL WILL BE BRINGING IT UP FOR A VOTE THEY MAY AGREE WITH THE ART A OR THEY MAY. DISAGREE OR HAVE ALTERNATIVE -- MOTIONS. SO IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY IF THEY CHOOSE SAY JUST SAY WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ARTIST SITE AND THEY BRING IT UP TO THEIR COUNSEL. BUT DO NOT WANT THE ARTIST SITE THEY THEY LIST THE GOLF SITE THEN OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HAVE -- CONFLICTING. WITH THE STATE NAME IN ONE THE THE COUNCIL NAMING ANOTHER -- IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WOULD HAVE A MANDATE OVER THEM OR YOU WANT TO SAY A FRIENDS OVER THEM BUT THERE WOULD BE. A CONFLICT TO TO RESULT. TO THE CITY COUNCIL RETAINS ITS. WHEN USE OF THIRTY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE TO DECIDE WHERE? TO PUT THE CEMETERY OR NOT PUT IT AT ALL CORRECT RIGHT. BUT SO SO LET ME JUST BACK UP WITH EXAMPLE FROM LAST TIME SO WHEN WE ORIGINALLY SAID THE ARDA THAT THERE'S WAS AGREEMENT AT THAT TIME. THEN LATER ON THEN THE STRAWBERRY FILLED WAS DECIDED BECAUSE WE MOVE FORWARD WE DIDN'T HAVE A CONFLICT BETWEEN SITE AND BETWEEN COUNSEL AND STATE. BUT HAD WE HAD A CONFLICT LIKE POSSIBLY NOW. THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TRYING TO RESOLVE THAT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID IN THE BEGINNING. MY INTENT IS NOT TO OF TO MOVE FORWARD UP AT ANY POINT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE MOVED FORWARD. REGARDING NAMING A SITE THIS TIME WE FELT LIKE WE'VE BEEN WORKING AT THIS NOW FOR SIX YEARS. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A RESOLUTION THERE'S GOT TO BE A POINT WHERE. WE EITHER MOVE FORWARD IN THIS HAPPENS OR IT DOESN'T AND SO THE RESULT COULD VERY WELL BE THAT THE COUNCIL DOESN'T AGREE WITH THIS -- THIS SITE AND THEN AND THEN AT THAT POINT WE HAVE A CONFLICT AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE COMPLETELY FORWARD BUT THE STATE DOESNT OVERRIDE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN HIS INITIAL MONEY CAME THROUGH BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NEVER FOR WHICH I CHAIRED. I THINK I VOTED ON THAT I VOTED ON THE ONE BEFORE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE VOTED ON Q. ANY MILLION SO. I'M CERTAINLY INVEST. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A VETERANS CEMETERY SOMEWHERE -- IN ORANGE COUNTY. I'M JUST WONDERING SINCE WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ABILITY TO MAKE A LAND USE DECISION. BUT INSTEAD ARE AUTHORIZING -- CALVET DECIDED CEMETERY AT SOME PLACE IN ORANGE COUNTY. WHY DON'T WE DESIGNATE THOSE SITES THE GOLF COURSE SITE? AND THIS ARTIST SIDE AND LEFT THE CITY COUNCIL. MAKE DECISIONS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE. BECAUSE LAST TIME I CHECKED WE'RE NOT A CITY COUNCIL. AND I THINK RIGHT EXACTLY AND I AND I CAN HEAR YOUR DISCUSSION ON THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN. WE'RE SERIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT THE GULF SITE EVEN TWO WEEKS AGO WE WERE NOT WAS THIS ALL OF THIS NEW INFORMATION THAT NOW THERE IS A A RENEWED PREFERENCE IF IT. THAT NAMES THE GOLF SITE OR EVEN TWENTY EIGHT MILLION JUST CAME UP IN THE LAST IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT WEEK OR TWENTY FOURTH OUR IS ANOTHER WAY TO SAY IT. WE PUT THIS LANGUAGE FORWARD ALMOST THREE MONTHS AGO THERE WAS MANY MANY TIMES THAT ON NOT ONLY THE CITY BUT THE DEVELOPER THEMSELVES AND THE VETERANS GROUP COULD HAVE CALLED MY OFFICE AND SAID LET'S SIT DOWN. AND DISCUSS IT NOT ONCE HAVE WE HAD THOSE REQUESTS SO IT IS REALLY THERE IS A TRUST ISSUE HERE WHEN WE'VE BEEN MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW I MEAN EVEN LAST WEEK THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WELL WOULD WOULD WE JUST LOOK AT POSSIBLY A HUNDRED ACRES BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TO HAVE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE ACRES. OF THE ARTIST SITE -- WOULD WE JUST CONSIDER THAT AND I'VE SAID IN THE VERY BEGINNING AND I'M HAPPY TO ALWAYS CONVERSE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND WORK THINGS OUT AND I WOULD BE. AGAIN EVEN AFTER VOTE HAPPY TO DO THAT WHAT IT TAKES. TO OR THREE OR FOUR TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND SO WHEN YOU GET SOME OF THIS INFORMATION COMING AT THE LAST MINUTE LIKE THIS MAKES IT HARD TO TO REALLY. FEEL THAT THIS IS A SINCERE. BUT I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MOTION. SOME MOTION LANGUAGE THAT WAS FLOATING AROUND AND YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT DOING MOTIONS AND COMMITTEE BUT THERE WAS A MOTION LANGUAGE FLOATING AROUND TO AUTHORIZE THE CALVET THE SITE THE CEMETERY. AT THE OPTION OF THE CITY OF IRVINE. AND I DO THE GOLF COURSE SITE WHERE THE ARTIST SITE AND WHAT WHAT IT WAS THAT WITH THAT MOTION LANGUAGE BE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU ASSUMING THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN PRESENTED AS THE AUTHOR WITH THIS BILL WITH ANY OF THAT. I'VE I'VE SEEN A LETTER THAT THE CITY SAID I THINK TO THE SENATOR NEVER SENT TO ME. THAT SO I THINK THAT THAT'S HIGHLY IRREGULAR I ALSO THINK WITH HIGHLY IRREGULAR. IS THAT A CITY ALONG WITH THE DEVELOPER WOULD SET SENT A SIGN A JOINT LETTER TOGETHER -- I WAS ON COUNCIL FULLERTON CITY COUNCIL. FOR EIGHT BEFORE WHERE YOU HAVE A CITY AND A DEVELOPER IN ESSENCE Là BILLY OFF LOBBYING JOINTLY TOGETHER ON CITY LETTER HEAD. VERY IRREGULAR SO THESE MAKE ME WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AS THE BILL IS PRESENTED AND THEN PUT THE TIME ON THE TABLE TO REALLY LOOK AND SIT DOWN AND MEET I WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND MEET WITH FIVE POINT. I WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND MEET WITH THE CITY AND EVEN SOME OF THERE ARE SOME -- COUNCIL MEMBERS I MEAN I HAVE MANY MANY TIMES DONE THAT BEFORE AND WE COME TO A VERY SINCERE SOLUTION WE'LL HAVE TO SEE TO THEIR TWO OPTIONS OF COURSE ONE THIS COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE HAS ONE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET BEFORE WE GO HONOR INTERIM STUDY SESSION NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IT COULD BE A TO YOUR BILL. BUT LET ME MOVE ON AND LET ME GET TO THE THE REAL ISSUE -- IN THE DIFFICULT POSITION I THINK THAT THIS BILL PUTS US AND THE SPREADSHEETS THAT I'VE SEEN ON THE TWO SIDES AND I REALIZE -- ONE ESTIMATE OF CONSTRUCTION FROM CALVET. MAYBE QUETION BUT IT'S A CALVET ESTIMATE. AND THEN THERE'S AN ESTIMATE CITY PUT TOGETHER FOR THE GOLF COURSE ALTERNATIVE. AND THE CALVET ARDA TOTALS NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS EVER TAKE. AND THE GOLF COURSE ALTERNATIVE IF THE CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT AND WHO KNOWS BECAUSE PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY WE'RE WE ACTUALLY DETERMINE. THE COST OF THESE TWO ALTERNATIVES AND SELECT. THE LEAST EXPENSIVE SATISFACTORY SOLUTION RIGHT NOW THIS BILL PUTS US IN BUT SOME OF US IN THE POSITION WHO SERVE CONSISTENTLY ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR SEVEN YEARS. IN THE POSITION OF VOTING FOR THE MOST EXPENSIVE. TWO ALTERNATIVES. IF IT'S TRUE IT NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AS OPPOSED TO STUDYING IT AND TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER IN FACT. TO FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS SOLUTION. IS EQUALLY SATISFACTORY CLOSE TO THE STATE AND TO THE CITY OF IRVINE SO YOU SEE THE POSITION THAT THIS PUTS US AND SOME OF HIS USER -- BUT WHAT I WOULD ADD INTO THAT IS CAL THAT HAS NOT STUDIED THE SECOND SITE AND THE CITY HAS GIVEN INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK THE COST IS. AND WE ALSO HAVE TALK TO TELL THAT ABOUT RE LOOKING AT THE ARTIST SITE AND THEIR NUMBERS REGARDING THAT THE COST THAT WAS GIVEN. NUMBER ONE IS IF THE SITE IS USED FOR SAY RETAIL OR HOUSING THAT. COULD BE ONE DETERMINATION OF SITE CLEANUP IF THE SITE IS USED FOR BURIAL ARE THOSE SAME NUMBERS USE SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE COULD THERE BE AN ADJUSTMENT THERE IF YOU'RE USING LAND FOR ONE YEAR USE VERSUS THE OTHER. AND COULD THAT REDUCE THE PRICE THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE WAS A LOT OF THE DEMOLITION COSTS AND SO FORTH ARE TALKING ABOUT REMOVING CONCRETE AND POSSIBLY FINDING SOME TYPE OF CONNECT CONTAMINATION ANOTHER. UP. TYPE OF SOLUTION COULD BE NOT TO REMOVE IT AND BRING IN -- DIRT. PUT OVER THE SITE. SO THESE ARE SOME WAYS TO LOOK AT COST SAVINGS THEY'RE NOT A SOLUTIONS TO LOOK AT LOWERING THE COST ONE OTHER OPTION WOULD BE. TO SLIGHTLY MODIFY THE BILL TO SPECIFY AUTHORIZE CALVET SINCE CALVIN IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE DECIDER THE CITY OF IRVINE IS. I'M TO GO TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND THEN HAVING THE THE STATE FUND. THE STUDY NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS ARE. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE CALVET STUDY THE FIRST. ONE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS ARE WITH BOTH SIDES WITH THE PROS AND THE CONS ARE SO -- NOT THAT WE MAKE A DECISION -- BUT THE CITY OF IRVINE WITH MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION AS TO WHICH SITE IS BEST. AND YOU'D HAVE YOU KNOW UNTIL TWO WEEKS FROM NOW TO FIGURE THAT OUT GET YOUR BILL. THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF IF I COULD JUST REVIEW THE HISTORY AS I UNDERSTAND IT. THE ARTIST SITE WAS THE DESIGNATED SITES SUPPORTED BY THE COUNCIL SUPPORTED BY NUMBER THE FOLKS THAT ARE HERE. ARE SOME YEARS AGO IS THAT RIGHT YES AND THEN AFTER THAT THEN THERE WITHIN FIVE POINTS. ATTEMPTED TO LOCATE THE CEMETERY TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS SO IT DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH ANY OF ITS DEVELOPMENT IS THAT RIGHT YES AND THAT WAS DEFEATED BY VOTERS IS THAT RIGHT YES. AND THEN THERE WAS A COUPLE OTHER SITES PROPOSE ONE IN ANAHEIM. RIGHT NO WHERE NEAR ANY HISTORIC -- ESTABLISHMENT REALLY THE MILITARY YES IS THAT RIGHT. AND THEN NOW NOW THE SITE. IN UNFORTUNATELY IT'S BEEN IN THE GOLF COURSE SITE IS NOT WHO DO OF THE GOLF COURSE OTHER THAN SOMEBODY THOUGHT MAYBE A GOLF COURSE SHOULD BE THERE'S SOME THAT. RIGHT YES OKAY. SO AND IN TERMS OF THE COST I HAVE. S. THAN WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE IS I I THINK I HAVE THE IRVINE STUDY AND MAYBE I CAN ASK THE OPPONENTS OF THIS IS ACTUALLY THE IRVINE STUDY THAT. MISTER CARMICHAEL MIGHT BE ABLE. TO I CAN HAVE YOU COME FOR DINNER SURE. IS THIS IS THIS IS SAYS THE REQUEST OF PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION IS THE ONLY THING I HAVE IN TERMS OF THE STUDIES SIZE THAT RIGHT THAT'S A SUMMARY THAT WENT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION FEBRUARY THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT. SO IN THIS IS WHAT I HAVE IN TERMS OF THE ARTIST SITE. IS THAT MR CARMICHAEL'S THIS RIGHT. IS THIS THE OUR SITE STUDY I BELIEVE JUST BY LOOKING AT THAT'S THE OWN REPORT COMMISSIONED BY CAL THAT LOOKS LOOKS TO BE OKAY. AND IN TERMS OF THE TOXICOLOGY OR THE TOXIC STUDY THAT WAS DONE ON THE GOLF COURSE I WHO DID THAT. IS THAT IT'S SO FAR BEEN DONE BY FIVE POINT IS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT PARK SO FIVE POINT DID THE STUDY THAT. YOU BASE YOUR COST ESTIMATE ON IS THAT RIGHT NO I COST ESTIMATE IS BASED ON THE INS REPORT. ACTIVELY IT WAS AN ADMITTEDLY A VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE THAT BASICALLY JUST BACKED OUT THE PURSE WERE FOOT DEMOLITION OR MEDIATION COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH OUR TO OFFER THAT NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. KNOWING IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE DONE FOR THE GOLF COURSE THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE DONE FOR THE GOLF COURSE THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT AND THERE'S BEEN NO OTHER THAN THE FIVE POINT ANALYSIS HAS BEEN OTHER NO OTHER ANALYSIS AS TO THE DEGRADATION. OF THE SITE KNOWS THE GOLF COURSE LIKE THAT RIGHT WELL THAT'S A IT'S BEEN THE DIRT HAS BEEN MOVED SO WE ACTUALLY OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AS TO WHAT'S THERE BECAUSE IT'S ALL IT'S BEEN TURNED. IN SYMPHONY ANALYZE THAT DIRT YES -- THAT DIRT WAS ANALYZED AND WE HAVE A PROTOCOL FOR REMOVING TOXIC SUBSTANCES DURING CONSTRUCTION. THERE WERE SEVERAL PIPES -- INSULATED PIPES REMOVED SEVERAL OTHER REMNANTS REMOVED DURING THE PROCESS SO WHO DID THAT STUDY. ARE THERE WAS A CONSULTANT THAT WAS HIRED TO DO THAT DURING THE PROCESS I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WE GET THAT PLEASE I CAN PROVIDE THAT. TO CERTAINLY SO IN TERMS OF THE COST -- YOU HEARD MR FOR SCHOOL ESTIMATE THE COST TO BE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- WITH WITH CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS DO YOU DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING HE SAID. THE ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW THE A. R. D. A SITE IS THE NINETY ONE MILLION FROM THE CAL THAT. ACTUALLY WAS SEVENTY MILLION CORRECT IT WAS IN LATER AMENDED BY CAL THAT TO NINETY ONE BECAUSE OF COSTS PRESS OF INFLATION WHAT WOULD THE COST BE IF WE DIDN'T TAKE UP THE RUNWAY. WELL I'D BE MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE ESTIMATING FOR THE GOLF COURSE I TO BELIEVE IN THE RANGE OF SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS SO WE DIDN'T REMOVE THE RUNWAY. THE SITES WOULD BE. EVEN COURTING YEAR ESTIMATE BASICALLY EQUALS THAT RIGHT. HARD TO SAY I MEAN THEN YOU'VE GOT A COST OF IMPORTING DIRT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST OF THAT IS BUT YES CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE LESS EXPENSIVE. AND AND I ALSO READ -- THAT THE GOLF COURSE SITE. DEVELOPMENT READY IS THAT CORRECT -- YEAH I MEAN DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY DEVELOPMENT READY ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE RUNWAYS HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND HAS BEEN TURNED. I SEE IN THE IN THE DOCUMENT THAT I SHOWED YOU AWHILE AGO THE REQUEST THAT THIS IS THE IRVINE STUDY I SEE IT SAYS THAT THE THAT A CONCEPT PLAN WOULD BE. NEEDED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE GOLF COURSE SITE IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT. SAYS IN YOUR IN THE IRVINE DOCUMENT IT SAYS THAT THAT WOULD TAKE -- TWELVE MONTHS THAT RITE AID SOUNDS RIGHT AND LEFT ON MY HEAD BUT YEAH IF IT'S THERE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE ESTIMATED OKAY. IN TERMS OF THE COST. IN TERMS THE COST SAVINGS ASSUMING THAT MR FOR SCHOOL IS CORRECT. RIGHT IN WE LEAVE THE RUN WHEN PLACE. WE ESTIMATE THAT TO BE ABOUT THE SAME CORRECT WELL KEEP IN MIND THERE STILL SEVENTY SEVEN BUILDINGS ON THE SITE THAT WOULD NEED TO BE TORN DOWN IN ADDITION TO THE RUN ROUTE SEVENTY SEVEN BUILDINGS I'M NOT GETTING A CHANCE TO CORRECT THIS. OKAY BUT YOU'LL GET A CHANCE. THE FIRST BILL -- ALL RIGHT THE ARM. AND I HEARD TESTIMONY WITH RESPECT -- TO WELL IF YOU IF YOU AND I SHOULD AS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE EVER BEEN TO MILITARY FUNERAL EVER BEEN TO A MILITARY FUNERAL. YES SIR I YEAH. YOUR FATHER SAID AND THEN THERE WAS A RIFLE VOLLEY IS THAT RIGHT. DOES NOT ARISE IF YOU IF YOU HEARD A RIFLE VOLLEY FROM THE FUNERAL. ALL RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE HEARD A RIFLE VOLLEY FROM THE FUNERAL AS SOME OF THAT'S NO DOUBT HAVE. YOU YOU UNDERSTAND THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ANY SORT OF SHOTS FIRED IN ANGER IS THAT RIGHT. PROBABLY ISN'T TO NOT SEEN IT I WON'T ASK YOU THAT QUESTION RIGHT BUT THE CONCERN ABOUT THE DESENSITIZATION -- LEAK WAS FROM THE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH DOES HAVE MORE INFORMATION AND DOES WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THEIR ACTIVE SHOOTER GIRLS. SO. I CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT IF YOU'D LIKE I WOULD BECAUSE AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN RIFLE VOLLEYS AND IN FACT. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THAT MIGHT BE A TEACHING MOMENT MIGHT BE TEACHING MOMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY HEAR. THE RIFLE VOLLEYS BACK THAT TEACHING MOMENT CAME FROM TEACHER SHARON QUIRK SILVA. THAT THOSE RIFLE VALLEY'S MAY REMIND THE SCHOOL CHILDREN THAT A VETERAN SOMEONE WHO SACRIFICE AT LEASTPART OF THEIR LIFE IS BEING BURIED BUT THE RIGHT. AND WE REFERENCE THAT IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF OUR LETTER THAT WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AS A AS AN APPROPRIATE. AND LONG STANDING WAY TO HONOR THE VETERANS THAT SERVED US IN THE RIFLE VOLLEYS WOULD SERVE AS A TEACHING POINT PERHAPS ON A REGULAR BASIS ILLUSTRATE. PERHAPS ALL RIGHT [inaudible] I'M. IN MISTER FOSCO I I KNOW YOU WANTED TO CORRECT SOME OF THE INFORMATION SO I'LL TURN YOU WHAT INFORMATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CORRECT. FROM WHAT I JUST HEARD. THREE THINGS THAT I'D RATHER I WANT TO SOUND LIKE EVERYBODY NINE AS I SAID JOE FRIDAY. JUST THE FACTS. THERE ARE NOT SEVENTY SEVEN BUILDINGS ON OUR SITE HELLO BUT I'M SORRY. YEAH THERE ARE NOT SEVENTY SEVEN BUILDINGS ON THE OR TO SITE THERE ARE. TWENTY FIVE I HAD. THREE CERTIFIED MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL DEMOLITION ASSOCIATION CONTRACTORS GO TO THE SITE WALK AT ALL AND GIVE ME WRITTEN BIDS ON REMOVING EVERYTHING. I HAVE IT. THE LOCK STOCK AND BARREL OF ITS SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL THEY REMOVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET A DAY IT'S A HUNDRED DATES. IT'S ALL CLEAR. AND THE GRADE THE SITE. AND FOR AN EXTRA MILLION THE ALL ALL THE UNDERGROUND. SO THAT'S ABOUT SIX MILLION. ALL IN SITES CLEAR LOOKS THE SAME AS THE GULF SIDE NOW. AND THEN FOR FOUR MILLION YOU BRING UP YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN MASQUERADE THE PROPERTY SO NOW IT'S ALL SMOOTH NICE DIRT. ELECTRIC GAS POWER DRAINAGE WATER EVERYTHING'S RIGHT AND NOW YOU BUILD YOUR SUMMIT THERE. TEN BUCKS A SQUARE FOOT IS A DYNAMITE CEMETERY. SO YOU CAN DO THE MATH QUICKLY. THIRTY MILLION FORTY MILLION FOR THE WHOLE. HUNDRED EIGHT SOME FIFTY MILLION. BUILD YOU THE ENTIRE PLACE. IN TWO YEARS. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT YOU CAN DO PHASE ONE SO THAT WAS ONE THING I HAVE TWO MORE THINGS. ON SO THAT WAS ON THE COST IT'S SIX MILLION THE OWNER REPORT SAYS IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MILLION SO THAT'S A BIG. BUMP. IT'S NOT SEVENTY SUDDENLY IT'S UNDER THE SECOND THING IS THAT -- MISTER CARMICHAEL USE THE WORD UNIFORM WHEN HE DESCRIBED THE GOLF COURSE AND I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE. MISS ONLY BEHOLD WORD IT IS NOT UNIFORM THIS SITE IS HORRIBLY. DISFIGURED IF YOU WELL ANYBODY THAT DEVELOPS AND BUYS LAND WOULD WALK ON THIS SITE BECAUSE OF ITS SHAPE. SO I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CHEAPER PERSONALLY WHY WOULD YOU. TAKE AN INFERIOR SHAPE SITE AND START POURING MONEY INTO IT THE YIELD ON THAT SITE WILL BE POOR. SO IT'S A GOOD THING IT -- IS BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET. TWO THIRDS OF THE GRAVE SITE YOU WITH A GUN ON THE HARD OF SIGHT. I'M SORRY THAT'S JUST A FAST. FINALLY IS NOT TWENTY ONE GUNS AT SEVEN AND IT'S ONLY FOR GUYS AND BULLETS FLYING OUT I UNDERSTAND. WELL IT. IS IT NO DOUBT. AND I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF VETERANS. THAT I JUST READ MY DAD AT ALL YEAH BUT I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE. NO MY KNOWN AS A PLEASE. YOUR COMMENTS. YOUR EXISTING. BUT I'M NOT A MILITARY. IN BACK TO MY QUESTION OR TEASE THE DEMOLITION IS NOT. A FORMIDABLE OF EXPENSIVE ITEM AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT. LET ME AS THE AUTHOR QUESTION. THIS BILL DOES NOT PRO. OF PROHIBITED PRECLUDE. THE FUTURE STUDY OF ALTERNATE SITES IS THAT RIGHT. RIGHT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THAT CONCLUDES MY QUESTIONS. IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP. I HAVE YET TO HAVE AN ANSWER TO MY BASIC QUESTION WHICH IS WHY ARE WE DOING IT. IF THE CITY COUNCIL RETAINS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE ITS DECISION AS TO WHERE TO CITE CEMETERY. OR NOT THIS IS THE CITY COUNCIL CAN CHOOSE A SITE BUT IN ORDER TO HAVE A VETERANS CEMETERY THEY HAVE TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I UNDERSTAND THAT SO IF THEY CHOOSE A SITE DIFFERENT FROM THIS BILL. YOU'RE GOING TO BE BACK HERE NEXT YEAR WITH ANOTHER BILL IF YOU AGREE WITH THEIR SITE SELECTION. WELL WHAT WE HAVE SAID IS AFTER THIS MOVES FORWARD AS IT IS WERE WILLING. TO AS IT MOVES TO APPROPRIATIONS CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION I MEAN THERE THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS THAT COULD. CHANGE THE FACTS AS FAR AS OF MORE INFORMATION WE'VE JUST HEARD RIGHT NOW ALL THAT. WINDOWS THE SENATE ANALYSIS CAME OUT IT SAID THAT THE GULF SITE WAS READY TO GO AND THAT. WHAT THE HELL THAT HAS NOT EVEN? ANALYZED IT THE SECOND PART IS THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TIMING WHICH WOULD BE FASTER OR I MEAN ON EACH SIDE YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE TIME. OR AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TO MOVE BOTH OF THESE FORWARD DEPENDING ON IF YOU. JUST ANALYSIS TO START WITH THE GOAL SITE WOULD REQUIRE THE BILL TO BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. WHICH COULD BE. YOU KNOW. AS EARLY AS THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER OR IT. YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL OF THAT TO WILL THAT WHICH WILL HOW WILL THE GOVERNOR WAY AND WHAT DOES HE HAVE A PREFERENCE ALL OF THESE THINGS NOTHING CAN START INTO YOU. SECURE THE REMAINING. WHATEVER IT IS LET'S SEE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT RIGHT. SO THERE'S STILL TIME ATTACHED. AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S PROS AND CONS ON BOTH SITE BUT RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO DO IS MOVE FORWARD WHAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAD UP INTO THE LAST FEW DAYS. WAS THERE WAS NO INTEREST IN THE GULF SITE THE GULF SO IT JUST KIND OF APPEARED AM I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY DOES THE CITY HAVE. THE SITE OF THE GULF SITE CLEARED ALREADY. AND IF THAT WAS OF MAJOR SITE TO pTHIS LANGUAGE THREE MONTHS AGO WHY DIDN'T THEY CONTACT US AS AN AUTHOR AND SAY HEY THIS IS CLEARED IT'S READY TO GO. CAN YOU SIT DOWN AND WORK WITH THIS WHY DID WAIT THEY WAIT TILL THE LAST LIKE FOUR DAYS THE TEST THAT QUESTION REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CITY OF IRVINE -- WITH THE IMMINENT AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN CHASING GUNS ALL THIS WE HAD A ROUND OF MEETINGS WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY DELEGATION. IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY WE LAID OUT THE CITY'S THE SIT WHEN I SAY WE THE CITY MANAGER HAS EXECUTIVE STAFF WE MET WITH THE AUTHORS. I'M OFFICE UNFORTUNATELY THE AUTHOR WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND THE MEETING BUT IN FAIRNESS TO THE CITY THEY LAID OUT THREE POSSIBLE OPTIONS. AND THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE IT TO THE MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL TO THE CITY COUNCIL. WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO SPECIFY ARDA AND THOSE THREE OPTIONS BECAME RATHER MUTE -- SO. AND IN THE THREE OPTIONS TO CLARIFY WHAT'S THE GOLF COURSE THAT WAS SHARED WITH THE ENTIRE DELEGATION. AS WELL AS THE ARTIST SITE AND POSSIBLY EVEN WHICH HAD EVEN BEEN PROPOSED POSSIBLY EVEN A HYBRID SITE. SO. YES THINGS HAVE RAMPED UP AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS STARTED TO MOVE HER BILL AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THE CITY VERY MUCH APPRECIATES. THE AUTHORS LEADERSHIP ON THIS WE JUST FEEL LIKE GOING BACK ARE THOSE FIVE YEARS OLD WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE GENTLEMEN'S ANALYSIS OF REMOVAL. THOSE ARE NOT THE CITY'S NUMBERS THE NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH PERHAPS CALL BACK AWAY IN. COULD BE A HUNDRED TEN WE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT ANALYSIS THAT REPORT WAS STROMBERG HAS IS DATED. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING CAN WE PLEASE GET THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT ALL SITES SO THAT WAS A LONGER ANSWER THAN YOU WANTED MISTER CHAIR AND? WE DID HAVE DISCUSSIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WHY DIDN'T THE CITY IN TWENTY TWELVE BRING UP THE GULF SITE ARE IN STATE. HERE'S WHERE WE'RE WE'RE HERE I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM LOW WELL PLEASE IT WASN'T ONE MEETING THAT CAME TO ME AND WE WERE JUST DISAGREEABLE WE FINALLY PUT A LOCATION AND WE AMENDED ARBOR BILL. BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET ANY SPECIFIC RESPONSE FROM THE CITY ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED WE WOULD JUST HEARING THINGS FROM THE BATHROOMS AND THE AND PART OF ME MR. SENATOR BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN BY DIVERT DEVELOPERS AND I AM GETTING OUTRAGE THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE WAITING ON DEVELOPERS WHEN THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. AND OF THE COUNCIL THIS SHOULD NOT BE WAITIN BY BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAYS OKAY I'M GONNA THROW IN TWENTY EIGHT MILLION. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT'S CAN EVEN COME WE'RE SAYING WE HAVE A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR? SHORTFALL WE DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY SHORTFALL BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY FORMAL LETTER THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS HOW DO WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS. IF I MAY IN YOUR MAKE MY COMMENTS ANY OTHER. DAMAGE FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THE V. IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT. YOU'RE OPEN TO COMPROMISE YOUR OPEN TO LISTEN -- AND WE ALSO HEARD THAT THE CITY OF IRVINE IN THE CITY COUNCIL IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE -- THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE TO THEM AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A SAY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THEY CAN OVERRIDE ANYONE BECAUSE IT IS THEIR CITY. THERE COUNTY AND THEIR DECISION ON THAT SIDE. THE OTHER THING THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER. CHAU IF THE VERBIAGE SAID THAT -- ARTIST SITE OR THE GOLF COURSE SITE. OF THAT WOULD THROW THINGS OFF FOR YOU IF IF IT CAME OUT THAT WAY. I'M NOT WHAT I'M SAYING WE'RE DEALING WITH WHAT WE HAVE FORWARD RIGHT NOW THAT. HASN'T EVEN IF THE WORD. FOR WOULD THROW THIS OFF I THINK YEAH WE ALL WANT. TO THE CEMETERY EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM AND EVERY VETERAN SURE OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY AND AND THOSE WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH US -- AND THOSE WHO WISH TO ONE DAY BE BURIED. AT THE CEMETERY IN. ORANGE COUNTY AND I THINK WE ALL WANT IT QUESTION IS WHICH WOULD BE THE SITE. AND AND TO PURSUE THE QUESTION OF WHICH ONE I I GAVE MY WORD TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND AND AS I SAID I DO SUPPORT THE BILL HOWEVER. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ISSUE. AND THE INFORMATION THAT HAS RISEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS JUST RECENTLY. IT WAS IT IS MY FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL RECEIVE A FAIR AND HONEST HEARING. AND I THINK WE'VE DONE THAT. AND I'VE ALLOWED EVERYONE TO SPEAK. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEEPLY EMOTIONAL ISSUE THAT FOR SO MANY. BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT OF OUR VETERANS. AND THEY DESERVE THAT. AT THE END OF ALL THIS POLITICAL MANEUVERING AND YOU HAD MENTIONED. OTHER INDIVIDUALS IT IS THE VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT SUFFER FROM. IN ACTION SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR AN ACTION AND I'M HOPING THAT WOULD BE ONE THAT WE CAN COMPROMISE ON WE OWE IT TO THEM TO FIND AT THE RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BUILDING PRINT TODAY BECAUSE IT'S MY COMMITMENT. TO BOTH OF YOU. AND TO THE AUTHOR. HOWEVER I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE BILL INCLUDE. WORD FOR THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR -- TO FURTHER DISCUSSION. AND I THINK IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO DO THAT. THAT BEING SAID I WANT TO LEAVE IT UP TO MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- TO MAKE YOUR DECISIONS -- BASED ON THE KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH OF ALL MAY. BUT REMEMBER THIS. THE VETERANS. ARE TO BE. ACKNOWLEDGED AND THIS IS THEIR WISH AND WHAT WAS THE BEST COURSE WE CAN TAKE. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO -- WITH THAT THERE ARE NO WITH OTHER. I'M SORRY I KNOW. SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO LET THE AUTHOR. CLOSE WITH REMARKS. DOES THAT WE WOULD RESPECTIVELY -- ASKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE LEGISLATION AS IT'S WRITTEN. I HAVE A MOTION THE FLOOR I'M SORRY [inaudible] OF YEAH. NOT TODAY. THAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDED IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION BEFORE WE TAKE THE VOTE THERE'S A OKAY LET ME JUST LET CENTER. TO I DON'T HAVE A COMMITTED AFTER CHECKING [inaudible] OKAY. MOST OF THE FRAUD MOVE THE BILL. WITH A VOTE. AB THREE SIXTY EIGHT TO PASS FIRST REFERRED APPROPRIATIONS. ARCHULETA I OR SOMEONE I GROWTH AUTO [inaudible] NIELSEN [inaudible] ROTH. NUMBER I NUMBER I WILL I THREE ZERO THE MEASURE SO I MOVED CALL. WE WILL DO THAT. WE HAVE RECESS JUST MOMENTS WE'RE GOING TO GO. YEAH WE'RE GONNA HOLD OVER ON CALL. AND THEN -- CORRECT CORRECT AND THEN [inaudible] MR. SO I WOULD I IN I KNOW I WAS IN A MEETING AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT COMING IS A FEMALE THAT TREND THE ONLY ONE ACTUALLY IN THIS. IN THE SENATE I VETERANS IT ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME. AND WE HAVE A NATIONAL CEMETERY IN KERN COUNTY. I KNOW THAT IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT HAVE A VETERANS CEMETERY IN LOCATIONS WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO VISIT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE RAIN I GET IT I KNOW THAT YOU'VE WORKED ON THIS BILL FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. I GUESS MY POSITION IS AND AND WE WE TALKED ABOUT IT. IF YOU WOULD JUST ACCEPT THE MAN WITH THE WORD OR IN IT AND THAT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EITHER SITE TO BE DEVELOPED EITHER THE AIR. STRIP SITE IN THE GULF SIDE -- IN THEN IT BE A LOCAL JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NOT TRUE IF THEY CAN PICK. THEN WITH THIS WE CAN SAY OKAY YOU GET EITHER ONE OF THE SITES YOU PICK DOWN IN YOUR AREA WHERE YOU GUYS LIVE. IN IN -- YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER SIDE BEING SENT REPUBLICAN LEADER AT CENTER MORLOCKS DISTRICT TO HIS MIND MEMBER. AND HE SUPPORTS BOTH A THAT IN ITS HIS DISTRICT AS WELL. SO I WOULD ASK IF YOU TAKE AN AMENDMENT WITH THE WAR IN IT SO WE CAN PASS THIS OUT YOU CAN NEGOTIATE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IN APPROPRIATIONS. AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL GET THE GOVERNOR SETS. THREE CAN SHE ANSWER THAT SIR. WELL OBVIOUSLY HAVING. TO EXCHANGE LIKE THIS TODAY WITH OTHER PARTIES HERE BEING PART OF THE EXCHANGE IS NOT IDEAL AS I STARTED MY COMMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING IS. UP. IS THAT WE WANT TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS CEMETERY SO I WILL JUST REPEAT THAT -- THERE SOME HIGHLY IRREGULAR -- WEIGHING IN ON THOSE OF EVERYTHING FROM A JOINT LETTER WITH A DEVELOPER AND A CITY ON LETTER HEAD THAT IS VERY UNUSUAL. THAT OF THE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION JUST KIND OF APPEARED WITHIN THE LAST FOUR DAYS AND IF IT REALLY IS TRUE THERE WERE MEETINGS THAT I WASN'T PART OF THAT SURE CERTAINLY IS OFFENSIVE AS AN AUTHOR OF BILL. BECAUSE I THINK THAT MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN AND SO WHETHER IT BE THE CITY WHETHER IT BE THE COUNCIL MEMBERS. OR EVEN THE DEVELOPER COMING STRAIGHT TO ME AND SAYING HEY THIS IS IMPORTANT AFTER ALL OF US AND THE VETERANS INCLUDED. LET'S GET ON THE SAME PAGE THAT CERTAINLY HASN'T HAPPENED SO IT PUTS MY RAIDER RADAR UP. I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT TO A BUT BECAUSE IT APPEARS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF FACTORS HERE SO -- CAN I ASK THE SENATE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS GOES OUT AND DOES NOT GET OUT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS. IT WILL HAPPEN IS WE'LL MOVE FORWARD WITH THE OTHER -- THE OTHER BILLS. AND THEN AT THE END OF IT -- BUT AGAIN IF IT FAILS THEN YOU CAN REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION. AND THEN THE VOTE ON THE CONSIDERATION AND THEN WE HAVE OUR LAST HEARING FOR THIS YEAR IS ON THE LINE SO TO COME BACK. IT WOULD HAVE A NOTE MOTIVATED THAT. IT'S A STRAIGHT [inaudible] NO. OKAY WE'RE GONNA THEN I'M JUST GOING TO HOLD OUT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I HOPEFULLY SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T TALK TO ME DIRECTLY. WILL -- ON CALL OKAY. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION OKAY. IF IT'S FIFTY S. IF IF THIS DOES NOT GET OUT TODAY I WOULD LIKE THE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA GO ON WITH THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS.

I TO MOVE THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY TO THE FLOOR TO APPROPRIATIONS. I AM -- CLEARLY NOT HAPPY WITH THE PRESENTATION AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE SERIOUS ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL. I AM FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF A VETERANS CEMETERY IN ORANGE COUNTY. SINCE I'M A LOCAL CONTROL GUY I'M NOT INTERESTED IN INTERFERING WITH THE WRITER THE ENTITLEMENT OF THE CITY OF IRVINE TO DECIDE WHERE THAT CEMETERY GOES -- IF AT ALL I THINK THAT'S A LOCAL ISSUE TO BE DECIDED BY LOCAL ELECTIVES. WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE CITIZENS OF THAT PORTION OF ORANGE COUNTY -- BUT HAVING SAID THAT MY I THINK MY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY SPREAD ON THE RECORD TODAY AND I WILL BE VOTING ON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF I MAY HI BEEN HERE TOO IS A LONG TIME MEMBER OF THE VETERANS COMMITTEE AND FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE SENATOR FROM THE ONLY VETERANS HOME IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE DEALT WITH THESE ISSUES A LONG TIME. IN A BID ON THIS COMMITTEE QUITE A FEW YEARS. I'VE NEVER SEEN THE INTENSITY AND FRUSTRATION. IN THIS COMMITTEE EVER. WE'VE SEEN HERE AS THIS DEVELOPED. THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL AND I DO UNDERSTAND LOCAL. FORCES AT PLAY. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. AND ALSO. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO PUT MY TRUST IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. BECAUSE THESE DAYS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE REALLY IS A LOST JURISDICTION. THE DECISIONS ON THE SUSPENSE CALENDAR AND AMENDMENTS ARE MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT THAT SAID I'M PREPARED AS MY COLLEAGUES GENDER ROTH TO VOTE YES TODAY. ON THIS BILL. LET IT MOVE ALONG. TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND KIND OF HOPE THAT ALL PARTIES CAN COME TOGETHER. IN SOME KIND OF GOOD FAITH. IT ALSO DISTURBS ME. THAT AS I HAD TO LEAVE FOR A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING IN MY OFFICE BUT THE HE IT APPEARS THAT THE AUTHOR WAS NOT EXTENDED. PROPER COURTESIES. IN TERMS OF SOMETHING THAT NEEDED TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO HER ATTENTION. THAT'S ANOTHER VIOLATION OF PROCEDURES. AND WHAT I CALL SENATORIAL COURTESY AROUND HERE THAT YOU'RE TAKES ME ALSO. SO COLOR ME IRRITATED THAT COLOR ME AS A YES VOTE AND I WILL STAY ENGAGED AS THIS BILL MOVES. THE VOTE THANK YOU AB THREE SIXTY EIGHT TO PASS FOR THREE REFER TO PREPARATIONS GROWTH. NIELSEN. I ROTH.
