BUT WE STILL THINK THERE ARE

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:26.859

WITH YOU SENATOR AND SENATORS.

AND A HALF FROM A AND IS SIDE

00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:53.279
SCHOOL VERY POOR SOULS WHO ARE

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.681
NOT ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC. A WOMAN

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.416
HAD INVITED A FRIEND TO COME

00:11:57.483 --> 00:11:58.451
AND STAY WITH HER WAS AFRAID

00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:02.655
FOR HER LIFE FROM HER SPOUSE.

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:05.057
WHEN THEY LEFT THAT MORNING TO

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.692
GO TO SCHOOL. FRONT YARD I'M OF

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.160
THE FIREARM AND BEGAN FIRING AT

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:08.861
THEM. THEY WERE ABLE TO GET

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:10.196
BACK INTO THE HOUSE. AND THE

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.497
LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOWED UP AND

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.932
THAT INDIVIDUAL IS NOW TO SEIZE

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.333
WAS TURNED THE GUN ON LAW

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:23.709
ENFORCEMENT AT THAT TIME. THAT

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:24.243
ENTIRE SCHOOL HAD TO GO ON

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.248
LOCKDOWN. TALK LINKED WITH THE

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:29.748
TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:30.316
AFTERWARDS ABOUT THE HORROR

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:31.917
THAT IS THAT WAS ONE OF THEIR

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:34.286
TEACHERS ALSO THAT WAS IN THE

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:34.787
HOUSE. AND SO JUST THE

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:36.856
COMPOUNDING OF THAT ESPECIALLY

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:38.424
IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS I JUST

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:39.058
FEEL LIKE WE DIDN'T HAVE A YEAR

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.861
TO WAIT. A AND WE HAVE A TOOL

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:42.761
THAT WE CAN PUT INTO EFFECT AND

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:43.796
I AM I AM. I KNOWLEDGE THAT WE

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.097
MAY HAVE MORE WORK TO DO AND

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:45.731
I'M WILLING TO DO WORK ON SOME

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.133
CLEAN UP THINGS AS WE MOVE

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:48.100
FORWARD. BUT I THINK WITH THE

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:48.934
HEIGHTENED. SENSE THAT WE ALL

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:49.969
HAVE THAT GUNS ARE GETTING OUT

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:50.970
OF CONTROL AND THAT WE KNOW

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:53.038
FACTUALLY THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.541
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES AND

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.475
HAVE WEAPONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.777
USE THEM. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT

00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:00.679
FOR A YEAR. I CAN I GET THAT

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:04.783
FULLY APPRECIATE. THAT RESPECT

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:11.090
THAT I AM. IN THREE BY. THE

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:11.690
OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT AROUND

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:13.459
KIND OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.560
RULES AND EXPERIENCES IN THE

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.997
TWO COURTS. AND IF THE BILL.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:21.133
GOALS FAR ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.535
THAT IN NON CRIMINAL COURT SEAT

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:23.068
SETTINGS WHERE THERE ISN'T

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:27.506
ALWAYS REPRESENTATION THAT WHAT

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:30.943
YOUR INTENT REALLY HAPPEN. YOU

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.510

YOUR QUESTION I THINK THE I

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.087
THINK THE WAY IN THIS DOES LOOK

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.656
A LITTLE BIT MORE AT THE CIVIL

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:44.623
CODES AND PARTICIPANT

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.492
PROTECTION WHICH I RECOGNIZE IS

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:47.626
A LITTLE MORE UNDER THE PURVIEW

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:51.564
OF. OUR NEXT COMMITTEE BUT I

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.299
BELIEVE IN THAT PARTICULAR

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:55.167
ROUND THAT'S AROUND THAT I HAVE

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:56.969
THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN FAMILY

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:59.438
COURT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.875
THE PROCEEDINGS IN FACT THAT

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:03.375

HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:14.620
THAT THESE RELINQUISHMENT ARE

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.121
HAPPENING AT THE FOLLOW UP ON

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.424

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:17.583
IF THE OPPOSITION COULD.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.083
ARTICULATE PERHAPS AGAIN

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.053
APOLOGIZE WHAT THE JUDICIAL

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.023
COUNCILS CONCERNS ARE BUT

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:26.725
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING HOW HOW WE

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:28.294
GONNA DO THIS YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:28.994
NOT IN A CRIMINAL COURT

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:31.297
PROCEEDING. SO DO YOU HAVE TO

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:33.065
GIVE NOTICE AND THE RIGHT TO

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:38.604
GET COUNCIL OF OR NOT. HOW YOU

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:39.204
CAN IMPLEMENT THIS I KNOW IT'S

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:42.875
A NEW CRIME. TO VIOLATE THIS

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:43.409
AND I'M WONDERING WHAT THE

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:46.011
FAMILY LAW EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:46.645
AND WHY WE'RE SORT OF TRYING TO

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:52.084
CREATE THIS HYBRID. SO FAR

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:53.185
AGAIN FROM THE FAMILY A

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.054
PERSPECTIVE THAT WE'RE NOT AND

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.888
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:59.258
BILL IS NOT CHANGING THE

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.759
RELINQUISHMENT REQUIREMENT THAT

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.494
ALREADY EXISTS SO THEY'RE

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.563
ALREADY EXIST AB SECTION IN THE

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.498
FAMILY CODE THAT REQUIRES

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:08.200
ANYONE WHO IS SUBJECT TO A

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.968
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING

00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:11.170
ORDER. TO RELINQUISH THEIR

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:13.639
FIREARMS UPON BEING GIVEN

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:14.973
NOTICE OF THAT ORDER AND THAT

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.110
INCLUDES TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:22.047
ORDERS THAT ARE ISSUED

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:22.648
OFTENTIMES AND AN EX PARTY YES

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:26.852
WITH THE COURT. THEY THE

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.221
REQUIREMENT TO. RELINQUISH

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:31.490
MEN'S GOD DOESN'T COME IT DOES

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:32.291
IS IT TRIGGERED HE IS A LOADED

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.526
WORD. INTEL THE RESTRAINT

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:35.894
PERSON IS SERVED WITH A COPY OF

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:36.729
THE RESTRAINING ORDER AND AT

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:38.297
THAT POINT THEY HAVE TWENTY

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:39.098
FOUR HOURS TO RELINQUISH THEIR

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.432
FIREARMS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.035
LICENSED GUN DEALER. AND FORTY

DOCUMENTATION TO THE FAMILY

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.806
COURT THAT THEY'VE DONE SO

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:49.875
THERE'S THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:50.976
FORM TO DO IT AND THEY'RE

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:51.910
SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE A RECEIPT

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:54.146
THAT SHOWS THE TODAY. THE

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:55.080
REALITY IS BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:57.716
NOT OFTEN TIMES. LAW

00:16:57.783 --> 00:16:58.317
ENFORCEMENT IS NOT OFTENTIMES

00:16:58.384 --> 00:16:59.985
INVOLVED OTHER THAN PERHAPS TO

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:02.988
SERVE THE RESTRAINING ORDER AND

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:03.489
THERE ARE NOT ATTORNEYS

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.324
INVOLVED AT THAT POINT IN TIME

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.625
THE REALITY IS THAT THESE

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.494
RESTRAINT PARTIES ARE NOT

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.095
RELINQUISHING THEIR WEAPONS.

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:11.296
WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE THEY

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:16.068
FEEL. THEY DON'T NEED TO

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:16.635
BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T READ

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:22.875
THE RESTRAINING ORDER. OR

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:26.278
WHATEVER CENTERPOINT SO. THE

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.846
FAMILY LAW CONTACT WHEN A WHEN

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:28.914
THE TWO PARTIES COME TO THE

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.716
FIRST NOTICED HEARING WHICH IS

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:31.183
NOTICED BY SERVING THE

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.318
TEMPORARY WATER. THAT IS THE

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:33.886
PLACE THAT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.754
THE JUDICIAL OFFICER. MAKING

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:36.789
AND DO AN ANALYSIS OF HAS THE

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:38.924
COURT RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT.

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:39.691
THE RESTRAINT PARTY DOES

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.326
POSSESS A FIREARM OR HAS ACCESS

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:43.095
AND CONTROL OVER A FIREARM AND

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:43.629
HAD THEY COMPLIED WITH THE

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:44.263
RELINQUISHMENT REQUIREMENTS AND

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.664
WE'RE ASKING THAT THAT HAPPENED

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:46.865
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS ON

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.634
THE MERITS OF THE CASE SO IT'S

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.068
NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:51.837
RESTRAINED PARTY UP HERE AND

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:52.571
ASK FOR A CONTINUANCE TO GET

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.473
COUNCIL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.141
NO PROBLEM THERE BUT WE ARE

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:59.745
ASKING THAT THE JUDICIAL%

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.281
OFFICER AT THAT POINT MAKE THAT

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:05.784
DRAMATIC REGARDLESS WHETHER

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:06.351
CASES COULD TAKE BACK LATER.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:12.024
EXACTLY. TO THE BRIDGE SO IS

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:17.196
OPPOSE BECAUSE. THANK YOU

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:17.830
BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:18.764
WE UNDERSTAND FULLY THE

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:19.798
PROCEDURES WE DON'T BELIEVE

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:20.365
THAT THE COURTS WOULD HAVE

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.167
QUALITY INFORMATION TO MAKE A

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.937
FINDING IN FAMILY COURT BECAUSE

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:27.406
PEOPLE ARE. LARGELY ON

REPRESENTED WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:33.212
INFORMATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.781
UPON WHICH COURTS COULD MAKE A

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.150
REASONABLE FINDING ONE WAY OR

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:41.320
AND OTHER THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:42.754
RESULT IN THE RELINQUISHMENT

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:45.457
THE PROCEDURES FOR

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:46.925
RELINQUISHMENT ALREADY EXIST

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:50.929
BUT THEY WERE HARD UP FOUGHT TO

00:18:50.996 --> 00:18:52.764
GET TO WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.833
AUTHOR I'M MAKING SURE WE

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.467
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROCEDURES

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:57.936
ARE WITH THE KIDS CAN DO WHAT

00:18:58.003 --> 00:18:59.304
THE LIMITS OF THE COURTS CAN

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:02.741
DO. MAKING FINDINGS BECAUSE

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:06.879
SOMEBODY. WAS IN COURT AND SAYS

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:10.916
THEY'RE IN DANGER. MAY NOT

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.284
RESULT IN A FINDING THAT THEIR

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:12.851
FIRE ARMS WHEN IN FACT THERE

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:13.785
ARE FIREARMS IN THE HOUSE WHICH

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:14.620
WOULD MEAN THAT THE COURTS HAVE

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:16.121
FAILED THAT PERSON AND THAT

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:16.588
SEEMS LIKE A TERRIBLE

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.390
SITUATION. SO SIMPLY WE JUST

WORK IT OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.195
THE COURTS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:23.729
CAN DO AND WHAT WE CAN. BE

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:30.002

YEAR LATER ACT I'M I'M

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:04.303

WE KNOW SOMETIMES HAVE TIME IS

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:14.079

FORWARD WE THINK THERE'S

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.015
URGENCY INVOLVED WITH IT

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:19.184
BECAUSE NO MATTER THE COURT.

LIKE WE CAN DO SOME CLEAN UP

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:28.493
LANGUAGE LATER IF WE NEED TO

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.928
BUT CERTAINLY WOULD BE A TO THE

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:31.964
COMMITTEES PROCESS THAT WE

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.298

GO. ALL THE WAY RIGHT NOW OR IF

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:38.604

JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONCERNS FROM

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:11.436
THE CRIMINAL SIDE. THE BILL AS

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:13.605
WRITTEN DOES NOT DISTURB OUR

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:15.807
PROCESS SEES THAT MAYBE THAT'S

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:16.441
INACCURATE WORRIED BUT WHATEVER

TRUE SOMETIMES THAT RUSHING

THINGS CAN BE. WHATEVER BUT WE

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:31.556
DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIX AND

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:32.057
I KNOW THAT THE JUDICIAL

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.193
COMMITTEE WILL BE VERY.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.095
JUDICIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW THE

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.196
CHAIR AND I KNOW THEY'LL BE

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:39.865
CAREFUL ABOUT REVIEWING IT. I'M

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:43.769
JUST STRUCK BY. THE NUMBERS THE

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:46.905
PERCENT OF WOMEN WHO WERE

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:47.539
MURDERED IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:51.710
STATE. AS A RESULT OF DOMESTIC

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:55.080
VIOLENCE THAT YOU'RE MOST LIKE.

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.349
AS A WOMAN. I'M RARELY GOOD I'M

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:00.419
NOT GONNA BE MURDERED EXCEPT BY

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:00.986
THE INTERNET PARTNER THAT'S

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:04.456
PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE STATS SHOW.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:05.357
THE OTHER AND THIS MAY BE WHY

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:08.126
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IN SUPPORT.

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:09.461
THE RECORDS SHOW THAT AT

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:10.462
MINIMUM THERE ARE FIVE SWORN

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:13.465
OFFICERS KILLED IN A- WHEN THEY

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:14.833
INTERVENE IN A DOMESTIC

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.135
VIOLENCE DISPUTE SO OUR OWN

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:18.637
PEACE OFFICERS IT'S ONE OF THE

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:21.106
MOST DANGEROUS SITUATIONS THAT

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.208
DAY WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT. THE

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:27.446
TYPE OF. EVERY TIME A SWORN

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:30.015
OFFICER PUTS THEIR UNIFORM ON

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:32.084
STEPS OUT THE DOOR THAT THEY'RE

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.518
TAKING THEIR LIFE IN THEIR

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:35.187
HANDS. AND HALF PERCENTAGE GOES

00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:36.521
UPS HOW MUCH HIGHER WHEN THEY
