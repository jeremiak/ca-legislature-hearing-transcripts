IS EXTREMELY TECHNICAL AS WE

UNDERSTAND IT AND COMPLICATED

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:40.244
BECAUSE IT HOLES IN WAGE

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:42.413
EARNERS AND FOLKS THAT ARE

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:43.914
PARTICIPATING THE GIG ECONOMY

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.482
WHICH IS WHY IT IS TAKING SO

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:46.884
LONG AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:48.519
THAT WE HAVE A VERIFICATION FOR

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:49.520
EACH OF THOSE TYPES OF

00:44:49.586 --> 00:44:51.755
EMPLOYMENT. SO THAT IS THE THAT

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.624
IS WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG ON THE

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.626

THE FACT THAT THE BLADE OUT MY

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:36.700
UNDERSTANDING IS. IF IT'S DUE

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:38.068

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:50.714
DETERMINATIONS AND HOW THE

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:51.915
CLAIMANT IS ANSWERING THE

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:53.150
QUESTION IT'S NOT THE CLAIM IS

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.218

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.258
DETERMINATION WORK THAT WE'VE

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:02.960

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:04.228
PERIOD OF TIME. AND ARE NOW

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.233
GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THAT BAND

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:10.934
BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. AND WE

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:11.902
HAVE TO FIX WE'RE GOING TO GO

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:13.237
BACK AND SWEEPING THROUGH WHERE

THEY DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE IN

00:46:14.404 --> 00:46:16.039
THE DETERMINATION PROCESS

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.674
BECAUSE THEY'RE RECEIVING THIS

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:18.675
INFORMATION FROM US THERE. THEY

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:19.977
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SO WE'RE

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.345
LOOKING AT IT WE HOPE TO HAVE A

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:23.213
FIXED WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK WE

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.748

PROGRESS. OKAY THEN THAT'S

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:32.322
IMPORTANT- ALSO LATE LAST YEAR

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:33.857
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT ALL THE

00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:38.829
EASY EMPLOYEES. HAVING-

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:39.630
COMPUTER AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:41.131
I'LL TOLD BY THE I BELIEVE THE

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.499
DIRECTOR I'M NOT SURE TOLD ME.

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:46.436
ON DURING OF OUR CALL. BUT I'VE

00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:47.871
BEEN TOLD THAT YOU ALWAYS SEE

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:48.805
SOME EMPLOYEES. YOU ONLY HAVE A

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:49.873
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE THAT WORK

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.244
FROM HOME. ON SOME BASIS. BUT

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:56.580
MOST OF THE PLAYS WERE TO WORK.

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.615
SO SOME TAKEN DESKTOPS HOME-

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:00.450
SOME OF THE GIVE A LAPTOP BUT-

00:47:00.517 --> 00:47:01.919
I WAS TOLD THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:04.922
ALL THE EMPLOYEES. ARE WORKING.

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.690
FROM P. D. ON THE COMMITMENT

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:08.859
BECAUSE SINCE HE- DOESN'T

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:10.861
OPERATE ON CITRIX. THEY HAVE TO

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:14.364
USE A STATE ISSUED EQUIPMENT IS

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.233
THAT CORRECT. FOR ANY WORK WE

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.501
DO REQUIRE STATE ISSUED

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:18.869
EQUIPMENT IT SHOULD NOT BE AN

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.470
IMPEDIMENT THOUGH BECAUSE

00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:21.405
WHETHER IT'S A DESKTOP BEING

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:24.374
DEPLOYED. M. OR A LAPTOP THE

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:25.976
WORK IF THE WORK ALLOWS ITS

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:27.611
LENDS ITSELF TO BE WORKING FROM

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:28.612
HOME THEY SHOULD BE AT HOME

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.280
WE'VE DONE ASSESSMENTS ON

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:33.250
TELEWORKING- SINCE THIS FALL TO

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.252
ENSURE ALL THAT COULD WORK. THE

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.587
PROBLEM IS WE HAVE VERY

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:38.589
DISTINCT CRITICAL WORKLOADS

00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:39.656
THERE'S UNFORTUNATELY STILL

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:42.459
PAPER BASED AND BOTH EMPLOYEES-

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.228
SAFELY HAVE TO COME IN THE

00:47:44.294 --> 00:47:46.163
OFFICE WHICH ALSO CONTRIBUTES

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.763
TO THE LATE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:47.898
EVERYBODY IN THE SAME. OFFICE

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:49.833
AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT'S ONE

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.401
OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:52.569
WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH OUR

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:53.971
APPEALS WORKLOAD IT IS

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:55.606
ABSOLUTELY PAPER BASED WE'RE

00:47:55.672 --> 00:47:57.507
WORKING ON AUTOMATING IT. SO

THAT WERE IN IT ONE DEPLOYS ARE

00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:02.112
ABSOLUTELY HEALTHY AND SAFE TO

DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO THE

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.115
OFFICE THE WORKLOAD CAN PRESUME

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.850
AT A NORMAL PACE OF TURNING IT

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:09.086
AROUND WITHIN TWO TWO WEEKS TWO

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:10.120
TO THREE WEEKS. WHAT IS THE

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:12.456
SAFETY REASONS THAT REQUIRE

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:13.957
LIMITED STAFF FOR THE PAPER

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:15.926
BASED WORK THAT IS A PRIORITY

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:18.128

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:47.149
IT NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION ON ONE

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.784
POINT ONE MILLION CLAIMS THIS

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.085
IS THE DASHBOARD FROM THE

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:52.121
STRIKE TEAM. AND AT THAT POINT

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:53.756
IN TIME IT WAS EXTREMELY USEFUL

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.457
FOR EASY TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:58.661
ITS WORKLOADS RATHER NOT CLAIM

01:09:58.727 --> 01:09:59.562
IT NEEDED TO TAKE ACTION OR EDT.

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:01.063
HOWEVER IT IS HARD TO

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.364
DISTINGUISH THE TWO FROM THE

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:03.999
DASHBOARD SO FOLLOWING THE

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:05.167
CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITORS

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.802
RECOMMEND RECOMMENDATION EVEN

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.971
THE IS ADJUSTING THE DASHBOARD

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.306
TO BETTER ILLUSTRATE HOW MANY

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.740
CLAIMS ARE IN THE QUEUE WAITING

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:13.475
FOR ATV ACTION BEYOND TWENTY

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.843
ONE DAYS. I WILL BE USER

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.345
FRIENDLY AND IT SHOULD BE OUT

01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:18.113
WITH THE NEXT TWO WEEKS ANSWER

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.783
YOUR QUESTION THERE ARE TWO

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:21.350
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:22.451
PEOPLE WAITING MORE THAN TWENTY

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:24.219
ONE DAYS FOR RESOLUTION OR

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:25.120
FIRST PAYMENT OR CONTINUE

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:27.156
PAYMENT. FROM EIGHTY THESE ARE

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:28.657
THE NUMBER OF THE CLAIMANTS

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.593
WERE EDB NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION.

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:32.061
THE BACKLOG IS THE RESULT OF

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:33.996
RESUMING ALL OTHER CRITICAL

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.531
WORKLOADS THAT IS YOUR WE'RE

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.566
WE'RE DEFERRED WHILE EIGHTY

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.301
FOCUSED ON THE ONE POINT SIX.

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.103
SO THE ONE POINT SIX WITH

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:42.504
COMPLETED BUT WITH FEBRUARY

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.440
FIRST ALL OF THE DEFERRED

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:45.574
WORKLOADS ARE NOW IN FRONT OF

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:48.444
IT. WE ARE. DOING A RISK

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.446
ASSESSMENT ON THEM. AND IN THE

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:54.049
WORK PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD. AND

01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:55.384
BECAUSE THERE ON WE ARE DOING

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:57.152
DETERMINE. SO THE ONE OF THE

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:57.920
THINGS THE STRIKE TEAM GAVE US

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.888
WAS A GREAT TOOL TO LOOK AT ALL

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:01.290
THE WORK THERE'S THERE ARE A

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:02.992
LOT OF WORKLOADS. AND BE ABLE

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:04.994
TO BE AGILE INCLUDES RESOURCES

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.030
SO WHILE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:08.530
FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.599
WAITING- WE ARE MAKING A

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.434
CONCERTED EFFORTS TOWARDS THAT

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.603
GROUP AS WELL ALL OTHER GROUPS.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.705
SO WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFF

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.140
THAT WILL BRING ON BECAUSE-

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.775
ANOTHER REASON FOR THE BACKLOG

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.944
IS FOR. FOUR MONTHS FIVE MONTHS

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.245
EVEN IF YOU DID NOT HIGHER AND

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:24.380
THIS IS THE FIRST WRITING

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:25.614
RECOMMENDATION SO THAT THERE

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.949
WAS A FULL FOCUS ON THE ONE

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:28.751
POINT SIX. CERTAINLY HAS HAD

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:31.086
ITS CONSEQUENCES. CONSEQUENCES

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:32.855
IT RESOLVE THE ONE POINT SIX

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.223
BUT HERE WE ARE TODAY NEEDING

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:35.457
TO MOVE FORWARD WHICH IS WHAT

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:37.292
WE'RE DOING. OUTLINED BY THE

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:39.662
STRIKE OF THE STATE AUDITOR IN

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:42.698
DETAIL AND- EIGHTY DEGREES

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:44.299
1100% AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:45.668

ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. SO- SO

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:49.471
I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE A LOT

TWENTY ONE DAYS PENDING. BUT

THEN THERE ARE. DEFERRED CASES.

01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:14.063
THAT STILL EXIST. AND THAT

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:16.198
WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE THAT

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.233

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:24.206

FIGURING ONCE CONCERNED WITH

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:40.956
TO LET THE CLAIM ITSELF YOU

REMOVING THAT OFF THE VIEW. SO

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:49.465
THAT YOU WILL ONLY SEE THE

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.366
AMOUNT OF WORK. CLAIMS THAT EDT

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:58.207
HUGE. IT IS A CLEARLY ADDRESSED

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:00.075
IN THE STATE AUDITOR REPORT AND

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:02.111
IT REQUIRES A RISK ASSESSMENT

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:04.446
BECAUSE IT IS SO HUGE THERE IS

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.715
NO WAY. BUDGET RESOURCE IS A

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:09.618
SIDE THAT WE CAN- NOT ONLY

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.386
RESUME THE WORK BUT BE CURRENT

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:12.755
IN A VERY SHORT ORDER IF WE

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.223
DON'T CHANGE OUR PROCESS IS WE

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:15.424
HAVE TO CHANGE THE PROCESS WE

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:16.492
HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:17.459
LOOKING AT HOW WE MADE

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.194
DECISIONS. STILL BEING IN LINE

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.295
WITH ALL THE A WELL

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:21.997
REQUIREMENTS SO THAT IS WHY THE

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.199
STATE AUDITOR CALLED OUT EDT

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:25.067
YOU NEED TO DO A RISK

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:27.102
ASSESSMENT ON THAT WORK DON'T

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.703
JUST DON'T TURN IT ON BECAUSE

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.638
IT'LL TAKE YOU. A VERY LONG

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:30.906
TIME TO GET CURRENT AND THAT'S

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:33.342
NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ANYONE SO

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:34.610
OKAY. THE DEFERRED INTO

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.545
DEFERRED WORK IS NOT PENDING

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:38.781
CLAIMS THIRD THAT'S THAT'S THAT

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:40.349

THAT'S THE CALLS THAT HAVE GOT

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.253
EVERYTHING ELSE. SO RIGHT SAID

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.288
SO THEN- RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ALL

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:48.257
IF THE DASHBOARD IS BEING

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:51.026
ADJUSTED BUT THERE'S TWO AND

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:51.760
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS

ARE THE ONLY ONE DAYS OR

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.200
FURTHER. AND THEN THERE ARE THE

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.002
OTHER CLAIMS ARE CLAIMS THAT

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:02.871
THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TO FOLLOW UP

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:06.642
WITH. EDT ONLINE TO ENSURE THAT

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:11.880
THAT PROCESS IS RESUMED. OR

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:12.781
CONTINUES. THAT IS CORRECT AND

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.082
THE- WHY THE ALL BE ALWAYS BE

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.884
CONFLICT CLAIMS WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.052
WORK WITH THE CLIMATE BUT

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.654
THEY'LL ALWAYS BE THESE CLAIMS

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.688
WITH THE CLAIMANT HAS TO TAKE

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:21.824
ACTION BECAUSE- OF. A LOT OF

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.292
THE TIME I MEAN THEIR PRIMARY

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.227
IS TO BE RE EMPLOYED RIGHT THAT

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:26.528
IS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE. AND

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.964
WHEN THAT OCCURS YOU OFTENTIMES

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:30.232
THEY WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE

CLAIM UNBEKNOWNST TO US- BUT

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.503
IT'S A CRITICAL STEP THERE SO

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:35.237
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.072
DISASSOCIATE. THAT BROKE FROM

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.640

OKAY SO DO THEY SEND THE AND I

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.234
JUST WANT CLARITY ON THIS

BECAUSE WE'VE GOTTEN SOME MIXED

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:49.804
INFORMATION SO WHO MAKES THE

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.606
DECISION OF FREEZING THE CARD

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.541

CARDS. IF THEY FIND FRAUD

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:18.166
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW I MEAN AS

01:27:18.232 --> 01:27:19.367
THEY HAVE SAID IN SEVERAL

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:20.868
HEARINGS IN THE NATION WIDE

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:23.805
FRAUD ISSUE AND THEY HAVE-

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:25.840
THEIR OWN PROCESS FEES AND

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.742
REGULATIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:32.380
COMPLY WITH. ON A FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:27:32.447 --> 01:27:34.182
THANK YOU I'M NOT QUITE SURE MR

01:27:34.248 --> 01:27:36.384

UNDERSTAND AND HAVE CLARITY ON

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.688
WHO MAKES THE DECISION THAT

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.557
THERE'S FRAUD. IS THE TWO

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.058
FOLDERS IT EDT MAKING A

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.660
DECISION AND THEN TELLING BANK

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:48.363
OF AMERICA AND IS IT ALSO BANK

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.198
OF AMERICA THROUGH THEIR SYSTEM

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:52.367
ALSO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:54.068
FRAUD SO IT'S BOTH. THAT'S A

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:55.637
GREAT QUESTION AND YES IT IS

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:58.172
BOTH SO WE BOTH HAVE SO EDT HAS

01:27:58.239 --> 01:27:59.641
A PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:01.643
THE WHICH WE'VE SAID BEFORE THE

01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:03.611
I. D. NEED THOMSON REUTERS

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:04.912
THERE'S AN INTERNAL FLAG THAT

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:07.281
WE HAVE. IF THE PERSON THE

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.217
CLAIMANT HAS PASSED THROUGH

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:11.152
THAT SO TO SPEAK THEN THERE IS

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:13.788
NO IF WE DON'T FIND FRAUD. WHEN

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:16.024
THE WHEN WE THEN SAY OKAY

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:18.259
THERE'S NO FRAUD AND THAT

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.961
PAYMENT GOES TO BANK OF AMERICA

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:22.096
BANK OF AMERICA SEES THINGS AS

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.297
THEY MENTIONED IN THE PAST

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:24.932
HEARING THAT EDT DOES NOT HAVE

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:27.602
ACCESS TO. LIKE TRANSACTIONAL

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:29.337
HISTORY FOR EXAMPLE SO IF

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:31.673
SOMEONE GOES TO AN ATM WE DON'T

01:28:31.739 --> 01:28:33.574
SEE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:35.543
THAT SORT OF FRAUD SO THAT'S

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:37.111
THE FRAUD THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:39.447
TO. AND THEY CAN THEN FREEZE

01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:41.215
THE CARD IF THEY FIND IN FRAUD

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:42.817
FOLLOWING REGULATIONS THE

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:44.485
FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT THEY

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:46.854
HAVE- BASED ON THE FACT THAT

01:28:46.921 --> 01:28:50.491
THEY'RE AN INTERNATIONAL. MULTI

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:51.626
BILLION DOLLAR BANK. RIGHT NOW

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:54.328
IT CLICK CLEARLY IN THE PAST

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:55.963
TEN YEARS OF A GOOD PARTNERSHIP

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.831
WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:59.534
HAS BEEN EQUALLY BENEFICIAL TO

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.303
BANK OF AMERICA. SO  GUESS AS

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.805
AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT NEXT

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:06.340
STEPS AND THE RENEGOTIATING THE

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:08.009
BANK OF AMERICA CONTRACT WITH

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:10.678
EDT. AM I HEARING THAT THESE

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:11.979
ARE POTENTIAL THINGS TO LOOK

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:13.748
OUT FOR IN TERMS OF WHO IS

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:15.516
ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:17.285
GETTING A HOLD OF THE CLAIMANT

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:18.352
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE ON ONE

01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:20.588
SIDE IT'S- EDT MAKES ONE

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:23.191
DECISION BASED ON THE INTERNAL

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:25.393
PROCESSES FOR FRAUD. BANK OF

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.795
AMERICA HAVING ACCESS TO- THE

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:29.297
TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION CAN

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:31.365
MAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION. YET

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:32.934
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.069
CONTACT OF THE CLAIMANT THAT'S

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:36.804
WHEN THINGS GET A LITTLE LOOSE

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:37.672
IN TERMS OF WHOSE

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:39.874
RESPONSIBILITY IT IS TO. GET A

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:41.943
HOLD OF THAT INDIVIDUAL. IS

01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:44.045
THAT ACCURATE OR- THAT AND THAT

01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:45.313
IS ACCURATE AND I AND I WOULD

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:49.016
SAY THAT- EDT WE DO YOU KNOW WE

ACTION TO- AVAIL ITSELF OF THE

INTEREST PAYMENTS WHICH ARE

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:41.855
SUBSTANTIAL. NOT SURE IF YOU

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:44.124

AND I'LL JUST. MENTION THIS IS

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:55.903

DOLLARS IN DEBT. AND THE OP ED

01:38:12.319 --> 01:38:14.121
LAYS OUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:15.222
A FUNCTION OF THE FACT THAT OUR

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:17.057
SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:20.060
REGRESSIVE. IS FUNDED AT TWO

01:38:20.127 --> 01:38:22.029
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE LEVELS AND

01:38:22.096 --> 01:38:24.164
SIGNIFICANTLY HURTS LOW WAGE

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:26.433

LONG TERM REFORM OF THE SYSTEM

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:38.879
WHERE'S YOUR THINKING ON THIS

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:41.715

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:42.916
MADAM CHAIR AND I AND WE'RE

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:56.463
SYSTEM FOR THE LONG HAUL AND IT

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:59.833
SEEMS TO ME WE ARE NOT. WE

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:00.467
HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CONVERSATION

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:01.869

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:29.863
MANY THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.365
FIX HE D. AT THIS MOMENT AND

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:33.400
OBVIOUSLY. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:35.169
ARE CONSTITUENTS SHUTTING DOWN

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:37.171
FRAUD THESE ARE TWO THINGS WE

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:38.839

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:40.674
POSSIBLE FOR US TO HAVE

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:42.509

COMMITTEE COULD THINK ABOUT A

01:39:50.918 --> 01:39:51.785
LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.487
COULD SPEND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:54.288
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT THIS

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.357
TIME. THIS IS A SITUATION THAT

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:59.460

REASONS THE FIRST IS FORM

01:44:49.983 --> 01:44:51.918
SHOULD FOLLOW FUNCTION- THE

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:54.121
WORKFORCE SERVICES THE BRANCH

01:44:54.187 --> 01:44:56.089
IS INSIDE AN APARTMENT AS WE

01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:57.991
TALKED ABOUT A GREAT DEAL-

01:44:58.058 --> 01:45:00.160
TODAY. IT'S PART WITH A PRIMARY

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.928
FOCUS ON BENEFITS AND TAXATION

01:45:01.995 --> 01:45:02.663
INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT

01:45:02.729 --> 01:45:04.231
INSURANCE DIVISION

01:45:04.297 --> 01:45:05.365
APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS IS A

01:45:05.432 --> 01:45:07.300
WORK FORCE FUNCTION WITHIN A

01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:09.302
DEPARTMENT WHOSE PRIMARY FOCUS

01:45:09.369 --> 01:45:10.837
IS LABOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:12.305
THEY CONSOLIDATED WORKFORCE

01:45:12.372 --> 01:45:14.041
DEPARTMENT WILL FOCUS ON

01:45:14.107 --> 01:45:16.209
WORKFORCE INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:17.711
AND REGIONAL TALENT DEVELOPMENT

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:20.247
PATHWAYS TO QUALITY JOBS EQUITY

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:21.415
IN INCOME ABILITY FOR PEOPLE

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:23.016
WHO MOST NEED GOOD JOBS AND

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.918
FORCE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WE

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.687
FEEL LIKE THIS FOCUS ON

01:45:26.753 --> 01:45:28.955
WORKFORCE IS AS URGENT AS

01:45:29.022 --> 01:45:29.523
ANYTHING WE COULD BE TALKING

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:33.460
ABOUT TODAY. THE SECOND IS- IS

01:45:33.527 --> 01:45:34.861
FOR SYSTEM ALIGNMENT TO GET

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:37.964
GREATER IMPACT THROUGH SCALE A

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:42.803
SCALE AND IMPACT- THE WORK. FOR

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:44.304
SERVICES. OUT WHAT PRESERVES

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:45.372
THE JOURNAL ARE ARE DELIVERED

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:47.240
LOW- AND IF ACROSS MULTIPLE

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:49.810
AGENTS. AND ENTITIES AT THE

01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:51.978
LOCAL LEVEL I IN EACH OF THESE

01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:53.280
FUNDING STREAMS COME FROM

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:55.115
DEPARTMENTS IN SACRAMENTO THEY

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:56.416
HAVE DIFFERENT MAJOR MISSIONS

01:45:56.483 --> 01:45:57.117
IN DIFFERENT PROGRAM

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:58.985
REQUIREMENTS INSIDER. SO IT IS

01:45:59.052 --> 01:46:01.588
VERY DIFFICULT. FOR COMPANIES

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:03.256
AND WORKERS TO NAVIGATE THE

01:46:03.323 --> 01:46:05.459
COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM. SO

01:46:05.525 --> 01:46:05.959
WE'RE CREATING THIS CALL

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:10.163
COMPLEXITY UP BY THE FACT THAT

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:11.932
THESE FUNCTIONS ARE MINISTERED

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:12.733
THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES IN

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:15.168
SACRAMENTO AND THEN GO DOWN TO

01:46:15.235 --> 01:46:16.103
MULTIPLE AGENCIES AT THE LOCAL

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:18.305
LEVEL. ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:20.741
SERVICE CULTURES REQUIREMENTS

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:23.977
DATA. COLLECTION PROCESSES IT'S

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:26.980
STATURE. THE END OF THE DAY.

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.014
THE PEOPLE WERE MOST TRYING TO

01:46:28.081 --> 01:46:30.517
SERVE. OUR FINDING THE SYSTEM-

01:46:30.584 --> 01:46:32.185
THIS PATCHWORK THAT VERY

01:46:32.252 --> 01:46:38.859
DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE- THE FIX.

01:46:38.925 --> 01:46:39.392
CAN'T BE JUST AT THE LOCAL

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:40.026
LEVEL WE SPENT. MANY YEARS MICE

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:44.731
IN- UPGRADE. WILL WORKFORCE PER.

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:47.734
AT TO BE MORE ALIGNED- SO IT SO

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:49.069
THAT THE SYSTEM IS LESS

01:46:49.136 --> 01:46:52.839
COMPLEX. AND MORE NAVIGABLE. HE

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.841
HE THE FACT IS WE CAN'T FIX

01:46:54.908 --> 01:46:56.042
THIS JUST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS

01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:58.945
I SAID WE CREATE THE CONDITIONS

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:01.381
FOR THIS- THIS PATCHWORK IN

01:47:01.448 --> 01:47:03.316
SACRAMENTO AND WASHINGTON DC-

01:47:03.383 --> 01:47:08.288
SO. IN FACT THIS PURPOSE OF

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:09.823
MAKING IT MORE NAVIGABLE FOR

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:11.358
WORKERS WHO MOST NEED SERVICES

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:12.859
AND FOR COMPANIES IS IT I THINK

01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:15.529
EXACTLY WHY. THE NEW DEPARTMENT

01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:18.031
IS SUPPORTED BY. BOTH LABOR AND

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.466
BUSINESS WE HAVE SEVERAL

01:47:19.533 --> 01:47:20.901
LETTERS I THINK THAT HAVE COME

01:47:20.967 --> 01:47:22.269
INTO THE COMMITTEE OF THE STATE

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:22.969
OF CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:24.304
COMMERCE THAT MANUFACTURING

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:26.439
TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AS WELL

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:27.207
AS THE CAL CALIFORNIA LABOR

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:29.342
FEDERATION- AND TWELVE OR

01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:31.411
THIRTEEN LETTERS. OF SUPPORT

01:47:31.478 --> 01:47:34.181
HAVE COMIC COME IN BECAUSE THEY

01:47:34.247 --> 01:47:37.217
RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT OF THE

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:39.219
SYSTEM ON'T LOCAL WORKERS AND

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:40.954
BUSINESSES AND HOW CAN BE

01:47:41.021 --> 01:47:41.421
IMPROVED THROUGH THIS

01:47:41.488 --> 01:47:42.956
STREAMLINING. THAT WORK THAT

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:46.293
WE'RE DOING THE STATE LEVEL- OR

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:48.161
NOT COMPLETELY THERE EVEN IF

01:47:48.228 --> 01:47:50.831
WHEN WE OUR IF WE- CONSOLIDATE

01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:53.233
THESE. THESE ENTITIES INSIDE

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.234
THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.837
AGENCY THERE STILL ARE AT LEAST

01:47:56.903 --> 01:47:58.171
THIRTY WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. THIS

01:47:58.238 --> 01:47:59.506
IS FROM LA- THIRTY WORKFORCE

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:01.174
PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED THROUGH

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:02.142
THIRTEEN DIFFERENT STATE

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:04.010
DEPARTMENTS. AND SEVEN AGENCIES

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:05.979
IN SACRAMENTO SO THERE'S A LOT

01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:07.647
OF ROOM FOR CONTINUED MR

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:09.182
MISALIGNMENT FRAGMENTATION THAT

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:11.885
CONSUMES. UP PRECIOUS TIME AND

01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:13.954
RESOURCES FOR JOB SEEKERS WHO

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:15.522
DON'T HAVE TIME AND RESOURCES.

01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:16.990
SO IS A SAID THE CONSOLIDATION

01:48:17.057 --> 01:48:19.526
WITHIN THE LABOR AGENCY. IT IS

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:21.561
A SIGNIFICANT FIRSTSTEP. TO

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:25.232
MAKE IN A SYSTEM. THAT IS- IS

01:48:25.298 --> 01:48:25.999

COUPLE COMMENTS- IF WHAT I WAS

ENTITY. I THINK WHAT I'M

02:03:28.434 --> 02:03:30.002
HEARING NOW IS. PERHAPS A

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:31.137
LITTLE BIT OF THE

02:03:31.203 --> 02:03:33.439
MISUNDERSTANDING IN THAT. WE

02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:35.508
ARE CURRENTLY IT IS SOMEWHAT OF

02:03:35.574 --> 02:03:38.144
A DECENTRALIZED TYPE OF PROCESS

02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:38.978
TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW IN A

02:03:39.044 --> 02:03:40.746
TRANSITION. WHAT WE'RE

02:03:40.813 --> 02:03:42.181
UTILIZING THESE WORK GROUPS WE

02:03:42.248 --> 02:03:43.449
HAVE A SERIES OF VERY DETAILED

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:45.751
WORK GROUPS. AND THEY ARE THE

02:03:45.818 --> 02:03:47.186
ONES THAT ARE ARE PUSHING A LOT

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:49.455
OF THESE ISSUES AND LOOKING AT.

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:52.558
IS WHEN WE GET. THE BILL

02:03:52.625 --> 02:03:54.293
LANGUAGE APPROVED AND WE COULD

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:56.061
STAND UP THAT THE APPOINTMENTS

02:03:56.128 --> 02:03:57.429
WOULD TAKE PLACE AND THEN THERE

CALIFORNIA. CONSUMER FINANCIAL

02:28:10.314 --> 02:28:13.517
PROTECTION LAW WHICH WAS FUNDED

02:28:13.584 --> 02:28:14.619
LAST YEAR- TO BE REASONABLE

02:28:14.685 --> 02:28:16.320
HOWEVER IT S UNCLEAR WHETHER

OR NOT THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE

02:28:18.256 --> 02:28:20.524
ACCURATE. ACCORDINGLY WE'RE

JANUARY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

02:28:39.810 --> 02:28:41.345
THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE LAW

02:28:41.412 --> 02:28:43.414
REQUIRES THAT COLLECTORS TO

02:28:43.481 --> 02:28:45.216
