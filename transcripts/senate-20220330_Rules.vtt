00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.021
COUNTIES IN OUR STATE. THAT

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.956
MEANS TWENTY EIGHT ARE NOT YET

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:06.758
COVERED SO THAT WILL BE OUR

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.593
FOCUS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.263
WE TRY TO TAKE THAT STATEWIDE.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.899
LET ME FOLLOW UP BECAUSE IT IT

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:17.035
SEEMS THAT AND YOU SAID IN YOUR

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:18.236
OPENING STATEMENT THAT THERE

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:20.104
WERE. I'M I'M NOT RECALLING THE

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:21.539
NUMBER EXACTLY THREE OR FOUR

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:24.575
MILLION REFERRALS OR- OR A

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:26.978
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION THAT

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:28.746
FORMAT. BUT THENAS A REQUEST

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:30.515
FOR INFORMATION THAT SERVICES

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:32.383
THAT AREN'T FULLY DEVELOPED FOR.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:37.088
ARE ADEQUATE RIGHT NOW SO IF. D.

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:39.891
A. THE EIGHT YOU JUST COMMENTED

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:42.293
THAT IT IS REALLY WORKFORCE

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.329
EXPANDING THE WORK FORCE AND

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:47.365
CARE BECAUSE THE BOOM. IN ELDERS

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:50.668
IS COMING AND SO IS IT REALLY.

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.904
ALL THE EXISTING KINDS OF

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.806
SERVICES ARE THERE IT'S THE

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:57.041
VOLUME THAT ISN'T THERE AND ITS

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:59.177
WORK FORCE THAT IS THE REAL

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.312
ISSUE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.715
THERE'S AN ADEQUATE VOLUME OF

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:06.984
CARE SERVICES AVAILABLE. AN

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:08.686
INTERNET I BELIEVE IT IT IS

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:11.889
BOTH- IN IN TERMS OF-

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.424
INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING OUT OUR

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:14.592
STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:17.495
CAPACITY TO PREPARE FOR TWENTY

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:20.164
THIRTY WHEN WE KNOW THE VOLUME

00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:21.766
WILL BE. AT A LEVEL WE'VE NEVER

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.001
EVER SEEN IN OUR STATE BEFORE.

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:25.903
WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:26.904
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT IS AN

00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:28.973
AREA THAT WILL BE TALKING TO THE

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.841
LEGISLATURE ABOUT IS HOW WE

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:33.144
BUILD- A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:35.213
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- A

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.181
STANDARDIZED INTAKE AND

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:40.118
ASSESSMENT PROCESS THAT- WHAT

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:41.853
WHICHEVER COUNTY AREA AND- WE

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:43.921
CAPTURE IMPORTANT DATA INCLUDING

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:48.893
SO G. DATA- DATE ON AIDS-

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.895
ETHNICITY AND SOME OF THE THINGS

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:52.563
THAT WE CAN BE A TRULY DATA

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.298
DRIVEN- SYSTEM IN OUR STATE.

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:57.168
ALSO TO BUILD THAT- WE DO OFFER

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:58.770
AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:04.142
STATEWIDE TODAY BUT TO BE ABLE.

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:07.678
AND TO REFER PEOPLE TO THE

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:09.480
APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND TO HAVE

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:11.783
. CULTURALLY COMPETENT SERVICES

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:13.551
AVAILABLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF AS

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.953
CHOICE WILL TAKE SOME CAPACITY

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.322
BUILDING AND THEN TO YOUR HERE

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.859
POINT- ABOUT THE WORK FORCE. IF

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:23.294
YOU HAVE A CENTRALIZED

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:25.296
NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND A REFERRAL

00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:27.532
PROCESS THAT THAT THE NETWORK IS

00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:29.267
INADEQUATE AND WE DON'T HAVE

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:32.270
SUFFICIENT- PROGRAMS AND

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:34.172
SERVICES TO MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.706
OR WE DON'T HAVE THE WORKFORCE

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:38.709
AVAILABLE STAFF THOSE PROGRAMS

00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:41.112
AND SERVICES- WE WILL BE

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.713
SUCCESSFUL SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.248
THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:47.952
CAPACITY BUILDING. AND WORKFORCE

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:49.287
OVERLAYS BOTH OF THOSE. WE'RE

00:34:49.353 --> 00:34:51.622
USING TOGETHER MY CONCERN BUT

00:34:51.689 --> 00:34:53.925
I'M STILL NERVOUS BECAUSE IT IT

00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:56.561
SEEMS THAT. BUT WE'RE GOING TO

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:57.862
BE REALLY GOOD IN THE REFERRAL

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.464
SYSTEM AND REALLY GOOD AT THE

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.032
INFORMATIONAL SYSTEM AND WE'RE

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:03.301
REALLY ON SURE THAT THEY'LL BE

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:05.403
AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF SERVICES

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.773
THERE- TO REFORM TO. AN

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.108
OBVIOUSLY THE WORK FORCE IS A

00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:13.277
MAJOR ISSUE DO YOU THINK IF WE

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:15.513
WERE TO DEVELOP SIGNIFICANT

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.181
ADDITIONAL WORK FORCE. THAT WILL

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:19.050
GET US THERE OR DO YOU THINK

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:21.018
THAT THERE ARE SUCH A LEVEL OF

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:22.720
FACILITY SERVICES AND OTHER

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.689
THINGS THAT THE WORK FORCE IS

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:26.891
THE FIRST STEP. AND OTHER STEPS

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:29.827
BECAUSE- THIS IS HAPPENING. A.

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:32.663
N. ARE WE HAVE FIND OUT WERE IN

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.966
IT. AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:36.000
MARCHING DOWN THE PATH A

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:38.169
DIFFERENT WAY ON THE WAY TO

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.304
BEING IN SO HOW DO YOU. HOW DO

00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:42.707
YOU ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT'S NOT

00:35:42.773 --> 00:35:43.941
JUST WORK FORCE BUT HAVING THE

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:47.078
BROADER AVAILABILITY OF THESE

00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:49.347
KINDS OF SERVICE. WHAT THE

00:35:49.413 --> 00:35:50.815
MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WAS A

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:53.384
CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO OUTLINE-

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:55.720
OUR NETWORK OUR SERVICE DELIVERY

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:58.389
SYSTEM AND TO IDENTIFY GAPS AND

00:35:58.456 --> 00:35:59.790
MOST CERTAINLY THROUGH THE KOBE

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:03.261
PANDEMIC WE HAVE. DISCOVERED

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.296
WHERE IN OUR STATE WERE LACKING

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:06.764
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.699
INDIVIDUAL WHETHER THEIR ACUTE

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:10.868
CARE. LONG TERM CARE OR HOME

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:13.838
CARE- SO WE HAVE LEARNED A

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:14.805
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OVER THE LAST

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:17.174
TWO YEARS ABOUT INADEQUACIES IN

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.976
OUR SYSTEM. IT'S NOT THE

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:21.178
DEPARTMENT OF AGING BUT- THE

00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:24.849
LEGISLATURE- DID SUPPORT- AT

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:26.050
HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:30.288
SERVICES- ROAD MAP THAT WILL BE-

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:31.789
EMBARKED UPON BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:33.624
OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT WE

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:37.495
ARE IN A- IN A ACTIVELY MOVING

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:39.430
TOWARDS- S. WHERE WE WILL MAP

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:41.999
ALL OF THE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES.

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:44.068
ACROSS OUR STATE NOT ONLY

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:45.636
MEDICAL SERVICES BUT MANY

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.371
SERVICES SUCH AS THE ONES

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:49.540
PROVIDED BY. THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:52.176
AGING THAT DON'T HAVE. AN INCOME

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:54.912
THRESHOLD THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:55.947
ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY BASED ON

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:58.749
NEED SO WE ARE- IN THE PROCESS

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:00.318
NOW OF MAPPING ALL OF THESE

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:02.320
SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN. TELL

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.854
COUNTY BY COUNTY WHAT IS

00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:04.755
AVAILABLE AND WHAT IS NOT

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:07.658
AVAILABLE AND THEN TO BUILD OUT.

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:10.494
A STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF. SERVICES

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.563
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND- I

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.965
WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:15.466

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:18.436
OF SLOTS IN OUR MSSP WHICH IS

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:20.171
THE MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR

00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:22.206
SERVICES PROGRAM- YOU HAVE

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:25.209
CONTINUED TO SUPPORT- SEE BASS

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:26.077
THE COMMUNITY BASED ADULT

00:37:26.143 --> 00:37:28.946
SERVICES. PROGRAM THAT'S ADULT

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:31.148
DAY HEALTH CARE- SO WE'VE SEEN

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.184
INVESTMENTS TO INCREASE CAPACITY

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.719
D. AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:38.889
TO. YOU KNOW CONTINUE WITH THOSE

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:40.992
INVESTMENTS. I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:44.462
MY POINT IS. IS THERE A ROAD MAP

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.130
TO THE CONTINUE INVESTMENTS

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:49.133
THAT'S COMING FROM THIS PLAN.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.701
FOR IT ARE WE JUST IDENTIFYING

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.737
WHERE THERE'S GAPS IN STORE-

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:55.139
LEGALLY MOVING TOWARD IT I MEAN

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.708
HOW ARE WE REALLY. GOING TO

00:37:57.775 --> 00:38:00.811
ADDRESS WHAT THE GAPS ARE IN THE

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:03.347
SYSTEM. WE'RE IN THE BEGINNING

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:06.250
STAGES OF- BUILDING THAT ROAD

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:08.486
MAP THAT WILL IDENTIFY THE GAPS

00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:10.154
AND THE NEXT STEP AFTER THAT

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:13.157
WOULD BE TO SELL THOSE CLOSE

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.825
THOSE GAPS- ONCE WE KNOW WHERE

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:17.995
THEY ARE AND THE LEVEL OF CARE

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.531
WHAT IS NEEDED- SO WE HAVE. A

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:21.899
GOOD DEAL OF ANECDOTAL

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:23.901
INFORMATION AND WE CAN CERTAINLY

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.736
TELL YOU. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.372
AGING WHICH COUNTIES HAVE ADULT

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.041
DAY HEALTHCARE CENTERS AND WHICH

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:35.212
DO NOT- BUT EVEN IF- WITH A MAP

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:38.249
LIKE THAT- IN A LARGE COUNTY YOU

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:39.250
KNOW SOME OF THE COUNTIES THAT

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:40.918
YOU HAVE. TO SAY THAT WE HAVE

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:43.087
ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE IN YOUR

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:45.423
COUNTY- IT MIGHT BE A THREE HOUR

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.857
DRIVE FOR SOMEBODY TO GET ACROSS

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:50.494
THE COUNTY ACCESS THAT SO. WE'RE

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.930
YOU KNOW WE THINK THE FIRST STEP

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:55.433
IS NAVIGATION THEN ACCESS.

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.368
WHETHER IT'S WORK AND THEN WORK

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:00.004
FORCE AND THEY ALL GO HAND IN

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.773
HAND. TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM TO

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.942
ACCESS THE SERVICES. THAT ARE

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:08.279
NEEDED AND- LOOKING AT THE

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.480
POPULATION YOU KNOW THE

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.382
DEMOGRAPHIC INDIVIDUALS FOR

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:13.451
INSTANCE SIXTY TO A HUNDRED ARE

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:15.386
NOT A HOMOGENEOUS GROUP AND THEY

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:17.488
ALL DON'T NEED THE SAME THING AT

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:19.323
THE SAME TIME SO THERE'S SOME

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.358
COMPLEXITY TO THIS THAT WILL BE

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:22.393
TALKING TO YOU- IN THE

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.228
LEGISLATURE AND YOUR STAFF AND

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:25.062
CERTAINLY WITHIN THE

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:26.163
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW WE

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.133
RIGHT SIZED. OUR NETWORK- FOR

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.203
ALL CALIFORNIANS WELL I CAN'T

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.370
HELP BUT COMMENT BECAUSE YOU

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:34.772
SAID SIXTY TO A HUNDRED PER

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.774
NIGHT OR BOTH IN THAT GROUP AND

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:39.543
WE ARE NOT MUCH OF THIS. IS SO-

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.646
BUT THE POINT IS I THINK I'M NOT

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:44.582
GOING TO BEAT THE DEAD HORSE ANY

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:47.618
FURTHER BUT I SPENT ALL THIS

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:49.787
TIME. JERRY MEETINGS HOW DO GET

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:52.189
TO THE END. JUST HOW DO WE GET

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:53.357
TO THE END WE COULD HAVE

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:56.727
PROCESS. FOR A LONG TIME BUT

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:57.995
THEY'LL BE PEOPLE THAT NEED

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:23.986
TO HAVE A THOUGHTFUL

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:25.621
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE SUBJECT

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:30.259
AND I THINK- I'D LIKE TO. TO ASK

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.461
A COUPLE OF GLOBAL QUESTIONS AND

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:35.798
ONE IS THAT. THERE IS BEEN THE

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:38.267
GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:40.036
BALLOT MEASURE AND THERE HAS

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:42.838
BEEN THE COMBINATION. OF FIVE

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:44.674
AGENCIES TO BECOME THE

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:49.512
DEPARTMENT- JUST- WHAT ARE THE

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:52.948
PRESSING ISSUES IN IN SORT OF

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:57.820
FOR MAKING THIS. OUR. JUST

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:03.159
INDUSTRY WE GOAL ARE LICENSED

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:06.462
AND AVAILABLE ONE WAY THAT THAT

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:07.663
IN COMPETING WITH THE

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:10.066
UNDERGROUND INDUSTRY IT WORKS

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:13.302
BETTER TO COME ABOVE GROUND AND

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:17.640
BE REGULATED. SO I THINK THERE

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.176
ARE A COUPLE OF PRESSING ISSUES-

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.545
THE INDUSTRY ITSELF IS IN A

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:24.680
TRANSITION AYE WE'RE SEEING A

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:27.083
NUMBER OF OPERATORS I HAD MOVED

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.685
FROM THE LEGACY MARKET INTO THE

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:31.887
LEGAL MARKET- AND THAT

01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:34.323
FACILITATE CONSOLIDATED BY IT A

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.125
NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:38.160
CREATING REGULATED PATHWAYS FOR

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:38.961
THOSE OPERATORS TO BECOME

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:41.230
LEGITIMATE HOWEVER WE HAVE A

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.399
SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:45.101
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO HAVE NOT

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.169
YET CREATED THOSE PATHWAYS. SO I

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:49.271
WOULD SAY THAT IS A REALLY

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.740
IMPORTANT- OUTSTANDING COMPONENT

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.308
THAT REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:53.909
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FROM THE

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.444
DEPARTMENT I'M IN TECHNICAL

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.979
ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE LOCAL

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.014
JURISDICTIONS TO HELP THEM I'M

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:01.550
ESTABLISH THOSE PATHWAYS AND

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:02.852
CREATE. WE CAN CREATE THOSE

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:04.253
PATHWAYS FOR LEGITIMATE

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.454
BUSINESSES THAT SO THAT'S A

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.323
REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT. I'M

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:08.424
ASIDE FROM THAT AS THE

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.526
DEPARTMENT IS NOW ESTABLISHED

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.995
AND STABILIZED- AS WE LOOK AT

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:14.430
OUR WORK I HAD A SIGNIFICANT

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:16.766
PRIORITY FOR US IS READ REDUCING

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:18.801
COSTS. OF PARTICIPATION IN THE

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.970
LEGAL MARKET I'M WITHIN OUR

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.571
CONTROL IS TO LOOK AT OUR

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:23.773
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND FIGURE

01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:26.442
OUT HOW. WE CAN STILL MEET THE

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:27.443
OBJECTIVES OF THAT FRAMEWORK

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.011
WOULD DO SO IN A WAY THAT

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:30.646
REDUCES THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.014
THAT A NUMBER OF OPERATORS

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.949
PARTICULARLY SMALL LEGACY

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:36.819
INEQUITY OPERATORS. ON FACE SO

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.288
THOSE ARE JUST A FEW- I CAN

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:41.490
LESSEN ANYMORE BUT I THINK THOSE

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.426
ARE THOSE ARE TOP OF MIND

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:44.760
PRIORITIES. I APPRECIATE THAT

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:47.096
MORE MADE DRIED OUT A LITTLE. I

01:07:47.163 --> 01:07:50.299
HAVE ONE OF THOSE DISTRICTS

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:51.400
WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF CANNABIS

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.234
GROWN AND THERE'S BIG SERVER

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:55.037
THERE'S A LEGACY SMALL OUTDOOR

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:57.473
FARMERS AND THEN. IT MONTEREY

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.208
COUNTY GIVE PRIORITY TO

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.277
GREENHOUSES AND AS A RESULT

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:03.946
THAT'S WHERE. THERE IS A LOT

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.781
GOING AND I VISITED A GREENHOUSE

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:07.483
SOUTH OF CHU ARE COUPLE OF WEEKS

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:10.286
AGO. AND THE PRICES HAVE PLUNGED

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:12.555
BELOW WHAT IS IN ESSENCE THE

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:16.192
COST OF DOING BUSINESS THEN. IF

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:18.160
THERE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.329
MAKING A CALCULATION TO COME

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:22.531
INSIDE THAT DOESN'T. TOTALLY

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.500
WORK AND I KNOW WHEN OUR

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.535
CONVERSATION. THERE WERE A WHOLE

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:29.371
HOST OF ISSUES THERE WAS THE

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.140
ISSUE OF HAVING ENOUGH PLACES TO

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.943
SELL THE PRODUCT TO MAKE IT A

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:35.711
COMPLETE CYCLE. THERE WERE WERE

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.780
ISSUES OF TAXATION AND WHETHER

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:41.016
OR NOT. EVERY DIFFERENT LEVEL OF

01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:43.285
TAXATION MAKES IT HARD TO

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:45.120
COMPETE THROUGH THE LEGAL

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:47.790
SYSTEM. ARE THERE THINGS IN IN

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:49.558
THOSE CATEGORIES THAT YOU MIGHT

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:52.528
ADDRESS YOU'VE WE SHOULD ADDRESS

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:53.762
TO MAKE SURE WE ENCOURAGE

01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:55.831
EVERYBODY TO COME WITHIN THE

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:59.535
SYSTEM. SO YOUR POINT ABOUT

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:01.971
MARKET HEALTH I THINK IS THE

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.005
FIRST ONE OUT THERE IS

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.340
CHALLENGES ACROSS THE SUPPLY

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:05.508
CHAIN WE HAVE ENORMOUS

01:09:05.574 --> 01:09:07.309
PRODUCTION CAPACITY BUT THERE

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:09.845
ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT OR I SHOULD

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:12.181
SAY SUFFICIENT OUTPUTS OUT FOR

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:14.817
CONSUMERS TO ACCESS SAFE TESTED

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.652
REGULATED PRODUCTS. SO THERE

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.554
DOES NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:21.357
WORK RELATED TO I'M BALANCING-

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:23.292
THE MARKET THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.393
ENSURING THAT THERE ARE

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.828
SUFFICIENT OUTPUT SO THAT

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.364
CONSUMERS CAN HAVE SAFE ACCESS.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.032
ONTO YOUR QUESTION ABOT TAX

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.867
REFORM YES I THINK THAT'S A VERY

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.369
IMPORTANT IT LOOKS I KNOW THAT

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.371
THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY FOCUSED

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.473
ON THAT ISSUE- EVIDENCED BY THE

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.509
NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.044
BROUGHT FORWARD. WELL WE ARE

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.445
NOT. THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF IS

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:45.581
NOT- THE TAX EXPERTS WHERE WE

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:47.316
ARE APPROPRIATELY SITUATED TO

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:48.817
WEIGH IN ON TAX REFORM IS THE

01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:53.022
CHALLENGES THAT THAT THE TAX

01:09:53.088 --> 01:09:54.290
STRUCTURE. PLACES ARE LICENSEES

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:56.892
I'M AND AS IT STANDS TODAY THAT

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.627
TAX STRUCTURE IS INCREDIBLY

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:01.597
COMPLEX- AND CREATES AN-

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.265
ADMINISTRATION CHALLENGES FOR

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.701
OUR LICENSEES AS WE SEE THAT TAX

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:08.103
I'LL BE BACK. THIS IS A CHANGE

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.472
I'M IN IT CAN HAVE. MORE

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:11.807
CHALLENGES ON A SMALLER

DATA FROM THE STATE LIBRARIAN

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.106
SHOWS THAT THIS DEFINITION

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:53.408
ENCOMPASSES ABOUT 80% OF THE

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.277
PEOPLE IN THE STATE WHO COULD

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:57.846

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:33.949
TO CIRCLE BACK ON THAT SPECIFIC

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:36.518
POINT- SEVERELY NARROWING IT

01:17:36.585 --> 01:17:38.920

IMPACTING AND THE COMMUNITY

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:49.031

AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF

FAMILY. I SO REALLY LOOKING AT

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.141
THOSE TWO CRITERIA WHICH ARE

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:00.642
ADDITIONAL CRITERIA WITHIN THE

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.744
PAST FEW THREE WAIVER PROGRAMS

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.813
I'M AS ADDITIONAL WAYS TO NARROW

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.681
THAT APPLICATION SO THAT WE ARE

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:09.051
APPROPRIATELY CHARLIE TARGETING.

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:11.253
THESE IN FINITE DOLLARS TOWARDS

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:13.488
INDIVIDUALS. FAMILIES AND

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.357
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:19.628
DISPROPORTIONATELY. IMPACTED BY

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:21.463
THE WAR ON DRUGS. GREAT THANK

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.432
YOU YOU KNOW AND IN MY CLASS IS

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:24.699
VERY BROAD BASED ONE I BECAUSE I

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.601
AM NOW THINKING BACK TO THE-

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.703
HEARING I HAD ON A CANNABIS TAX

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:31.039
REFORM AND WE HAD A REALLY GOOD

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:33.675
A STRONG ARM. DIVERSE GROUP OF

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:35.477
PANELISTS TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.446
THE INS AND THE OUTS OF CANNABIS

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:37.913
ACROSS THE STATE FROM

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:40.449
CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION TO

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:43.552
DISTRIBUTION AND- RETAIL AND

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:46.354
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DO BETTER I

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:47.789
THINK YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT-

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:48.990
YOU KNOW IT SEEMED LIKE THIS WAS

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.692
GOING TO BE MANNA FROM HEAVEN

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.694
AND YET WE'RE STILL SORT OF. IN

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.396
THIS LOG TRYING TO FIND. A

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:56.398
BALANCE. FOR WHAT WE WERE

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:58.200
EXPECTING AND HOPING FROM

01:18:58.266 --> 01:18:59.768
LEGALIZING CANNABIS IN THE

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.903
REALITIES THAT WERE IN. AND THEN

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.672
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:05.807
DISCUSSIONS AROUND EQUITY. SO

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:08.310
FOR YOU WHAT DOES CANNOT BE

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:10.545
CANNABIS EQUITY LOOK LIKE. FOR

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:12.781
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:16.585
FUTURE. WHAT IS ADEQUATE CAMPUS

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:17.719
EQUITY LOOK LIKE I THINK IT

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.488
LOOKS AT LIKE A DIVERSE MARKET

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:21.857
LIKE OWNERS WHO ARE ABLE TO.

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:23.525
OWNERS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:25.360
EITHER BY THE STATE OR BY LOCAL

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.129
JURISDICTIONS AS HAVING BEEN

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:28.497
NEGATIVELY. AND DISPROPORTIONATE

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.499
IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS I'M

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:32.033
REALIZING ACTUAL OWNERSHIP IN

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.602
THOSE BUSINESSES AND GENERATING

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.770
GENERATIONAL WEALTH I THINK IT

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:38.140
ALSO MEANS A DIVERSE WORKFORCE-

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.341
THOSE TWO THINGS I THINK ARE

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:40.609
REALLY IMPORTANT AND REFLECTED

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:42.277
IN THE NUMBER OF LOCAL EQUITY

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.945
PROGRAMS AND SOMETHING THAT THE

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:46.448
STATE. I'M HAS STARTED TO EXPAND

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.884
ALBION'S AS THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.186
IN PART TO THAT FEE WAIVER

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:53.788
PROGRAM SO REALLY A DIVERSE

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:54.856
MARKET. GREAT WELL YOU KNOW

HAVE TO ALL WORK TOGETHER THE

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:06.835
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:07.936
SPACE AND MEANINGFUL TO EVERYONE

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.504
WHO IS INTERESTED BECAUSE UNTIL

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.206
WE DO THAT THERE WILL STILL BE

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:13.008
AN UNREGULATED MARKET THAT IS

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:14.709
THRIVING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:16.845
GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN. ALL

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:18.780
OF THE HOOPS THAT WE ARE ASKING

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:19.714
THEM TO JUMP THROUGH TO OPEN UP

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.883
A BUSINESS. AND REALLY SORT OF

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:22.951
MAINTAIN IT ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:24.653

A LOT OF THIS USING CASH- BUT

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:38.500
ALL THOSE ARE STILL STRUGGLES.

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.168
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:40.902
CHALLENGES BETWEEN THE NORTH AND

AND THE COUNTIES WORK TOGETHER

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.243

AND THEY WANT IT FOR A REALLY

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:00.956
GOOD PRICE AND THEY DON'T REALLY

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.257
CARE ABOUT ALL OF THE- SAUSAGE

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:04.659
MAKING- AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:05.994
IT'S TOO ARDUOUS THEY'RE NOT

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.729

ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WHICH IS A

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:49.971
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DOWN THE OF

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.425
LITTLE BIT ON IT YESTERDAY IN

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:13.295

PRESENT AS TO WHETHER THERE WILL

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:23.038
BE SOME SORT OF PRESSURE FOR

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:25.407
STATEWIDE REQUIREMENT THAT

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.409
PROHIBITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:29.844
FROM HAVING SOME AUTHORITY OVER

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:31.513

WITH IT AND HAVE A LOT TO DO

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:52.901

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.576
CAN SYMPATHIZE. WITH THOSE

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:37.212
CONCERNS- WHEN WE DEVELOPED OUR

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:38.480
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN SAN

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:41.149
FRANCISCO I WE DID SO WITH AN

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:43.351
EYE TOWARDS WANTING TO- HAVE

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:45.353
SOME CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT AND

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.722
UNDERSTANDING. OF THE BUSINESSES

LEVEL BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.629
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS. OUR TO

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:03.198
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WOULD

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:05.266
REQUIRE CERTAINLY I'M MORE LAW

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.669
ENFORCEMENT AND IN MANY OF THE

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:08.770
CITIES AND MY DISTRICT THEIR

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:10.772
CONTRACT WITH THE SHERIFF. IN

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:12.841
THOSE COSTS GO UP ANNUALLY SO

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.909
HAVING A SPECIFIC. ARE LAW

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:17.378
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OVERSEEING

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:18.446
WHAT WOULD BE CANNABIS

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:19.681
BUSINESSES AND SOME OF THESE

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:21.816
COMMUNITIES I THINK IS WHAT

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:23.451
WEIGHS HEAVILY ON LOCAL

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:25.587
GOVERNMENTS A MIND IN AGAIN OF

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:29.357
COURSE THE ACCESS TO- THE YOUTH-

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:31.426
IT WOULD PROBABLY. BE A

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:33.528
SIGNIFICANT ONE TWO THAT JUST

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:34.796
PUTTING ON THE RECORD I THINK IT

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:36.598
WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:37.499
STANDARDS IF THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:39.234
SOMETHING THAT EVENTUALLY GAPS

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.903
TO. OUR MORE DISCRETION-

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.105
REQUIRED BY THE STATE- I THINK

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.340
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:46.741
STANDARDS ARE SET FORWARD ON

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.409
WHAT EVIDENCE BASED WOULD BE

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:51.713
REQUIRED TO ALLOW- THAT- LACK OF

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:53.848
OVERSIGHT OR LACK OF ABILITY TO

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:55.216
APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THAT OUR

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:57.151

01:58:53.125 --> 01:58:55.862
I'VE SORT OF SEEN IT CHANGE- IN

01:58:55.928 --> 01:58:59.966
THE QUALITY. OF- OF HORSES AND

01:59:00.032 --> 01:59:01.934
IN IN THE PURSES AND THERE'S

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:03.703
BEEN A SHIFT TO KIND OF TAKE

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:05.004
THINGS AS YOU MENTIONED OUT OF

01:59:05.071 --> 01:59:06.739
THE COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY BACK

01:59:06.806 --> 01:59:08.841
TO THE EAST- AND IF THIS IS

01:59:08.908 --> 01:59:11.544
GOING TO BE AN INDUSTRY THAT WE

01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:13.346
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- YOU KNOW. I

01:59:13.412 --> 01:59:14.714
DO THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:16.015
THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:19.218
AT I HOPE THAT YOUR BOARD WILL.

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:22.188
CONTINUE TO BE INTERESTED IN-

01:59:22.255 --> 01:59:25.424
HOW WE ARE SUPPORTING. JOCKEYS

01:59:25.491 --> 01:59:26.926
BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:29.195
A PREVALENCE OF- SUBSTANCE USE

01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:31.464
AND ABUSE. ARE BASED ON THE

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:32.999
PRESSURES AND THE STRESS OF THE

01:59:33.065 --> 01:59:35.234
JOB- IN THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:37.503
THAT THEY HAVE TO. SORT OF

01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:39.372
MONITOR- AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:59:39.438 --> 01:59:41.240
THEIR MEETING REQUIREMENTS TO

01:59:41.307 --> 01:59:42.808
REYES. AND THEN THE FACT THAT

01:59:42.875 --> 01:59:44.310
REVENUES HAVE GONE DOWN WITH

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:45.978
RACETRACKS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:59:46.045 --> 01:59:48.481
WHICH IS REALLY IMPACTED-

01:59:48.548 --> 01:59:50.583
WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE WHO

01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:53.119
GENERATIONS. OF FAMILIES WHO

01:59:53.185 --> 01:59:56.355
HAD. LIVELIHOODS BECAUSE OF THIS

01:59:56.422 --> 01:59:58.324
INDUSTRY WHERE THEY WORK THEY'VE

01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:02.562
LIVED- YOU KNOW AFTER TRACK.

02:00:02.628 --> 02:00:06.532
CLOSE TO IT WORKING WITH HORSES-

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:09.268
AND NOT WANTING TO. DECIMATE

02:00:09.335 --> 02:00:10.903
THAT INDUSTRY SO I WOULD JUST

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:13.573
ASK THAT- YOU ALL CONTINUE TO

02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:14.907
LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE I

02:00:14.974 --> 02:00:17.443
THINK THEY WILL BE PREVALENT-

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:18.911
FOR HOW THIS INDUSTRY IS ABLE TO

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:21.113
SUSTAIN IN THIS STATE. AND HOW

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:24.617
WE ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT- BACK-

02:00:24.684 --> 02:00:26.485
COMPETITIVE HORSES WHO MAY BE

02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:28.254
FROM CALIFORNIA OR WHO HATE MAY

02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:30.323
NOT BUT THE GOAL IS TO HAVE AN

02:00:30.389 --> 02:00:32.058
EXPERIENCE THAT IS BOTH SAFE FOR

02:00:32.124 --> 02:00:33.859

THAT YOU ALL WILL. CONTINUE TO

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:55.448

QUESTION A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

02:01:16.636 --> 02:01:18.938
AND THAT IS THAT THE F. CLOSE

02:01:19.005 --> 02:01:20.706
ALAMEDA BECAUSE THERE WAS A

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:24.243
SPIKE IN FATALITIES IN TWENTY

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:25.711

REDUCE THAT. M. O. THERE WAS A

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:39.592
SIX MONTH PERMITTED IT WAS

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:43.696

OF TWENTY SEVEN DEATHS FROM

02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:53.839
MULTIPLE CAUSES AND THERE WAS A

02:01:53.906 --> 02:01:56.275
DEBATE ON THE BOARD IT'S WITH

02:01:56.342 --> 02:01:57.043

STATISTICS SHOWING THERE'S A

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:15.461
GREAT APPROVAL BUT IF THERE WAS

02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:16.529
TWENTY SEVEN DEATHS AT. AT

02:02:16.595 --> 02:02:17.863
GOLDEN GATE FIELDS LAST YEAR

02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:20.332
IT'S TOO SHORT TO DECIDE WHETHER

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:22.201
OVER TIME THERE'S A DRAMATIC

02:02:22.268 --> 02:02:25.671
IMPROVEMENT SO. HOW DO YOU TALK

02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:27.740
ABOUT THIS WHAT'S ON THE BOARD

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:30.609
AND- WHY YOU THINK WHAT YOU'RE

02:02:30.676 --> 02:02:33.746
DOING IS REALLY. DOING THE RIGHT

02:02:33.813 --> 02:02:36.015
INTERVAL FOR REPORTS TO GET ON

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:39.118
TOP OF THIS. WELL FIRST LET ME

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:43.122
SAY I DIDN'T VOTE TO SUPPORT

THANKS MONTHS LICENSE- THIS NEED

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:50.096
THIRTEEN THIRTY TO OPERATE

02:02:50.162 --> 02:02:51.764
EFFECTIVELY- AND SHORT TERM

02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:53.966
LICENSES. THREE MONTHS IS WHAT

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:56.202
THE PROPOSAL WAS DISTRUSTFUL

02:02:56.268 --> 02:02:58.804
POSITIVE LOCAL AND STATEWIDE

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:02.041
ECONOMIC IMPACT GENERATED FROM

02:03:02.108 --> 02:03:05.611
RAISED MEATS. APPROXIMATELY A

02:03:05.678 --> 02:03:07.246
THOUSAND WORKERS EACH RACING

02:03:07.313 --> 02:03:11.250
FACILITY. MANY OF WHICH ARE

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:13.252
AFFORDED HOUSING ARE ESPECIALLY

02:03:13.319 --> 02:03:16.155
VULNERABLE TO AN IMMEDIATE

02:03:16.222 --> 02:03:18.424
TERMINATION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT

02:03:18.491 --> 02:03:21.293
. REGULATIONS ALL OUTLAWS WE

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:23.863
HAVE THE ABILITY REGULATORY

02:03:23.929 --> 02:03:26.632
ABILITY TO SUSPEND RACING AND

02:03:26.699 --> 02:03:29.602
TRAINING AT A TRACK AT ANY TIME

02:03:29.668 --> 02:03:32.238
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY

02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:34.106
ISSUES- AND WE CONTINUE TO

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:35.975
EXERCISE THAT DISCRETION AS WE

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:41.180
MONITOR RACING ACTIVITY- I ALSO

02:03:41.247 --> 02:03:43.749
BELIEVE THAT. WHICH WAS

02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:46.786
MENTIONED EARLIER FELLOW HORSES

02:03:46.852 --> 02:03:49.622
IF THEIR OWNERS AND TRAINERS

02:03:49.688 --> 02:03:50.489
FEEL THERE'S ONLY THREE MONTHS

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:52.858
LICENSE THEY WON'T SPEND THE

02:03:52.925 --> 02:03:56.061
MONEY TO TRANSFER THEM HERE

02:03:56.128 --> 02:03:57.997
TRANSPORT THEM WHAT THE MOCK. UP

02:03:58.063 --> 02:03:59.832
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PERIOD OF

02:03:59.899 --> 02:04:03.636
TIME OPERATE THEIR BUSINESS- AND

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:05.671
THEY WILL MOVE OUT OF STATE. SO

02:04:05.738 --> 02:04:06.906
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY I

02:04:06.972 --> 02:04:09.275
DIDN'T FEEL THAT THREE MONTHS

02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:11.977
LICENSE- WE CAN WE CAN WE SEE A

02:04:12.044 --> 02:04:16.282
SPIKE IN. EQUINE DASSLER. WE CAN

02:04:16.348 --> 02:04:17.983
WE CAN SHUT IT DOWN AND THAT'S

02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:19.785
WHAT WE'RE DOING I BROUGHT THAT

02:04:19.852 --> 02:04:21.420
UP IN OUR IN OUR LAST MEETING.

02:04:21.487 --> 02:04:22.955
THAT WE SHOULD WILL MONITOR IT

02:04:23.022 --> 02:04:25.424
DAILY WHICH IS WHAT THE FUTURITY

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:27.626
STAFF IS DOING AND STORAGE AND

02:04:27.693 --> 02:04:31.730
WORK AND WE SEE A SPIKE. WE CAN

02:04:31.797 --> 02:04:33.833
WE ALL TAKE MERGENCY ACTION AND

02:04:33.899 --> 02:04:36.836
WE WILL WE WILL WE WILL SUSPEND

02:04:36.902 --> 02:04:39.171
RACING. AND WE WILL LOOK INTO

02:04:39.238 --> 02:04:41.574
THE MATTER WHICH BERMAN. FIND

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.776
OUT WHY THEY'RE SUCH AS BY WHAT

02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:45.411
WE'RE DOING THAT DAILY ANYWAY MY

02:04:45.477 --> 02:04:47.813
STOCKTON LOS ALAMEDA IS. STILL

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:51.150
HAPPENING HOLDEN GATE- BUT WE

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:52.484
FELT THAT THEY DIDN'T TURN

02:04:52.551 --> 02:04:58.724
AROUND- EVAN WAS ADEQUATE- THE

02:04:58.791 --> 02:05:02.461
WHAT WE SAW. OF HER TURN MATALAN

02:05:02.528 --> 02:05:08.133
. ARE QUICKLY- BUT NO FIRE. WELL

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.535
IT'S AN IN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

02:05:09.602 --> 02:05:11.337
BALANCE BECAUSE AT SOME POINT

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:13.272
AND THERE'S TO JOBS AND IF

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:16.108
THERE'S A SPIKE IN HORSES DEATHS

02:05:16.175 --> 02:05:17.776
. IN SOME WAYS THAT'S WHAT IT

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:19.778
GETS WEIGHED AGAINST WHAT THE

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:22.114
REAL ISSUE SHOULD BE. WHY ARE SO

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:23.949
MANY HORSES DYING AND IS THERE A

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:27.119
WAY TO GET ON TOP OF IT AND IF

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:29.922
THE GOLDEN GATE FIELDS IS TWENTY

02:05:29.989 --> 02:05:32.424
SEVEN DEATHS LAST YEAR. R. IT

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:34.293
JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S HARD TO

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.527
MAKE A DEFINITIVE STATEMENT

02:05:35.594 --> 02:05:37.229
THEY'RE GETTING ON TOP OF IT FOR

02:05:37.296 --> 02:05:39.331
ONLY TWO MONTHS INTO THIS YEAR

02:05:39.398 --> 02:05:40.766
MAYBE THERE'S NO DEATHS AT THE

02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:43.335
FIRST TWO MONTHS. AND THAT COMES

02:05:43.402 --> 02:05:45.671
TO THE CONCLUSION BUT- I THINK

02:05:45.738 --> 02:05:47.006
WE AT THE RULES COMMITTEE TO THE

02:05:47.072 --> 02:05:49.108
CONFIRMATIONS AND THIS TURNS

02:05:49.174 --> 02:05:51.043
INTO AN OVERSIGHT PROCESS AND

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:53.979
I'M- JUST HOPING THAT. YOUR

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:55.814
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE A

02:05:55.881 --> 02:05:57.549
GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THOSE DEATHS

02:05:57.616 --> 02:06:00.419
AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:06:00.486 --> 02:06:03.455
WE HOPE THE BOARD WILL ACT ON.

02:06:03.522 --> 02:06:07.526
IT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND- IF

02:06:07.593 --> 02:06:10.062
IN FACT. THE BOARD IS WILLING TO

02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:11.430
REALLY TAKE STRONG ACTION

02:06:11.497 --> 02:06:12.965
BECAUSE THERE'S A SPIKE IN

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:14.800
DEATHS OVER THE SHORT TERM.

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:16.535
THAT'S A STRONG STATEMENT AND I

02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:18.237
THINK THAT'S WHAT I JUST HEARD

02:06:18.304 --> 02:06:21.373
YOU SAY BUT- THE A SHORTAGE YOU

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.809
CAN MAKE THE RENEWALS. WHEN

02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:27.479
THERE'S SUCH A DRAMATIC INCREASE

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:31.383
IN. IN A CLIENT DEBTS IS SORT OF

02:06:31.450 --> 02:06:33.218
A STATEMENT THAT YOU WILL BE

02:06:33.285 --> 02:06:35.487
LOOKING AND THAT THEY HAVE TO DO

02:06:35.554 --> 02:06:37.890
THAT RATHER THAN FEELING THAT.

02:06:37.957 --> 02:06:39.258
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE GIVEN A

02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:41.226
PASS UNTIL THERE IS ANOTHER

02:06:41.293 --> 02:06:43.929
SPIKE SO. I THINK IT IS VERY

02:06:43.996 --> 02:06:45.931
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS

02:06:45.998 --> 02:06:46.765
EXCHANGE SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE

02:06:46.832 --> 02:06:49.134
CONCERN AND- AND YOU ACTED AS

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:52.204

02:06:59.044 --> 02:07:01.547
MONITOR. AND SCRUTINIZE

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:05.751
ACTIVITIES AT THESE RACE TRACKS-

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:08.153
AND WE WILL TAKE APPROPRIATE

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:08.821
ACTION. THERE'S NO THERE'S NOT A

02:07:08.887 --> 02:07:12.725
DAY GOES BY THAT WE ARE ALL OVER

02:07:12.791 --> 02:07:13.993
. ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID WHEN

02:07:14.059 --> 02:07:16.962
I FIRST GOT ON THIS BOARD WAS IT

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:18.597
WILL NOT BE BUSINESS AS USUAL

02:07:18.664 --> 02:07:20.733
IT'S NOT LIKE THE OLD DAYS. AND

02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:23.068
SINCE THEN WE'VE ENACTED THIRTY

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:26.939
REGULATIONS. M. EQUINE DEATHS

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:29.541
ARE WAY DOWN. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE

02:07:29.608 --> 02:07:32.411
PROUD OF THAT NO WE DON'T. WE

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:34.813
DON'T I DON'T LIKE TO SEE ONE

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:38.751
HORSE. NO ONE ON THIS BOARD AND-

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:43.022
BUT IT YEAH- YOU HAVE THESE

02:07:43.088 --> 02:07:45.691
ISSUES WELL I THINK THERE'S JUST

02:07:45.758 --> 02:07:47.292
ONE PLACE WHERE MAYBE WE'RE

02:07:47.359 --> 02:07:48.994
TALKING OVER PASSED EACH OTHER

02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:49.962
BECAUSE MAYBE IT LOS ONLY TO

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:52.498
STARE DOWN BUT AT GOLDEN GATE

02:07:52.564 --> 02:07:54.533
FIELDS THEY WEREN'T SO DOWN AND

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:58.370
THAT IS REALLY RECENT AND SO ARE

02:07:58.437 --> 02:08:02.341
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS AND IT

02:08:02.408 --> 02:08:03.742
CAME UP IN AN EARLIER HEARING

02:08:03.809 --> 02:08:05.210
TODAY. THIRTY REGULATIONS DON'T

02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:06.645
MEAN ANYTHING. UNLESS THERE'S AN

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:08.480
ABSOLUTE CHANGE IN WHAT THE

02:08:08.547 --> 02:08:10.949
OUTCOME IS SAID THAT'S WHAT I

02:08:11.016 --> 02:08:13.118

WHEN I SAID THEY WILL WORK ON

02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.231

02:13:58.029 --> 02:13:59.965
I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND AND SAY I

02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:02.000
DO THINK IT IS TRUE THAT THE

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:03.135
REFORMS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD

02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:04.870
HAVE. HAD SIGNIFICANT

02:14:04.936 --> 02:14:08.740
IMPROVEMENTS I FOLLOW THIS I

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:11.843
REPRESENT ARE A PART OF SAN

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:14.446
DIEGO THAT DEL MAR AND THAT

02:14:14.513 --> 02:14:16.615
HISTORY AND THAT LEGACY SO THE

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:17.716
WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:20.152
LIMITING THE USE OF RIDING CROP.

02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:22.687
CHANGES TO THE DESIGN-

02:14:22.754 --> 02:14:24.523
INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF COURSE

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:26.558
COURSES FITNESS BEFORE THE RACES

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:28.860
RESTRICTIONS ALL MEDICATIONS.

02:14:28.927 --> 02:14:30.729
REVIEW OF VETERINARY RECORDS ALL

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:31.730
THOSE THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:14:31.797 --> 02:14:34.499
THE POOR SOME POOR POST MORTEM.

02:14:34.566 --> 02:14:37.102
REVIEW OF THE FATALITIES- ARE

02:14:37.169 --> 02:14:39.171
ALL TOOLS THAT WERE NEEDED TO

02:14:39.237 --> 02:14:39.805
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:42.073
OF DEATHS. ARE BECAUSE WE'VE

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:43.842
SEEN IT FLUCTUATE YEAR BY YEAR

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:46.745
END AND ALSO. OF THE SCANNERS IN

02:14:46.812 --> 02:14:49.080
THE TOOLS AVAILABLE- NOT

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:50.582
THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:51.883
UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW WE'RE

02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:53.084
WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:14:53.151 --> 02:14:55.387
IS A POSSIBILITY SO I THINK IT

02:14:55.454 --> 02:14:57.689
HAS WORKED TO MAKE. CALIFORNIA A

02:14:57.756 --> 02:14:59.491
LEADER WHICH HAS HAD SOME

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:03.128
PROBABLY ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON-

02:15:03.195 --> 02:15:04.362
THE PEOPLE WHO BRING THEIR

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:06.264
HORSES HERE TO RACE I THINK OUR

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:08.166
OUR STANDARDS ARE HIGHER. NEVER

02:15:08.233 --> 02:15:09.701
THE LESS I THINK THERE'S MEMBERS

02:15:09.768 --> 02:15:10.969
OF THE PUBLIC WITH IT YOU'RE

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:14.172
WELL AWARE OF BECAUSE- I WHO

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:19.744
STILL THINK. AND THAT IS A BIG

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:24.082
EXTREME. BACK TO- SENATOR

02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:25.417
GLAZERS COMMENT ABOUT LOSS

02:15:25.484 --> 02:15:27.919
ALAMEDA DOES I REMEMBER WHEN WE

02:15:27.986 --> 02:15:30.155
SAW OF SPIKE IT WASN'T A

02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:31.990
SIGNIFICANT SPIKE BUT ANY COURSE

02:15:32.057 --> 02:15:34.559
DEATH ISSUE SAID IS SOMETHING

02:15:34.626 --> 02:15:37.162
TO. BE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I

02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:41.399
REMEMBER- AFTER A FEW IN SAN

02:15:41.466 --> 02:15:43.835
DIEGO IN DEL MAR I WENT OUT AND

02:15:43.902 --> 02:15:46.738
DID A TOUR THE TRACK AND TALK TO

02:15:46.805 --> 02:15:49.140
FOLKS AND LOOKED AT. EVERYTHING

02:15:49.207 --> 02:15:51.877
THAT WENT INTO PREPARING A TRACK

02:15:51.943 --> 02:15:55.213
FOR- NOT ONLY FOR RACING DAY BUT

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:58.717
FOR- THE PRACTICE AND THE

02:15:58.783 --> 02:16:00.652
TRAINING. DO YOU- DID YOU

OVERTURNED ITS ORIGINAL. ODD

02:16:08.026 --> 02:16:10.529
DECISION ON THE ONE YEAR

02:16:10.595 --> 02:16:12.364
LICENSE- RELATED TO LOSS ALAMEDA

02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:14.866
IS. WAS THERE AN EVALUATION DONE

02:16:14.933 --> 02:16:19.137

ME IS THERE ANY. DO YOU WHAT DO

02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:22.974
YOU BELIEVE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE

02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:24.776
FINALITY SAID THAT TRACK WAS OR

02:16:24.843 --> 02:16:26.912
ANALYSIS DONE AND IMPROVEMENTS

02:16:26.978 --> 02:16:29.147
MADE TO THE TRUCK CAN YOU TELL

02:16:29.214 --> 02:16:30.982

REMEMBER. SOLD OF MOST RECENTLY

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:38.590
WITH THESE QUIET AND WE ACTUALLY

02:16:38.657 --> 02:16:40.692
LOOK AT THE SCIENCE LAST YEAR.

02:16:40.759 --> 02:16:44.062
AGAIN FUTURE B. HAS HAS BEEN IN

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:47.566
DAILY CONTACT WITH LOS ALAMOS-

02:16:47.632 --> 02:16:49.467
AND IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATE BUT

02:16:49.534 --> 02:16:52.304
THEY HAVE THE TRACK ITSELF IS

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:54.105
IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATE SAFETY

EXPERTS AND REYES- BOTH IN THE

02:16:59.911 --> 02:17:03.882
RACING SURFACES- THEY'VE NOW

02:17:03.949 --> 02:17:06.685
ASKED THEM VETERINARY RESEARCH

02:17:06.751 --> 02:17:08.587
THEY'VE ASKED UC DAVIS TO GET

02:17:08.653 --> 02:17:11.256
INVOLVED STUDYING- INTERESTING

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:13.091
THINGS LIKE THE LONG BAR

02:17:13.158 --> 02:17:16.494
FRACTURES. IN QUARTER HORSES-

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:22.000
THAT'S COMING OFF OF- THE WAY IN

02:17:22.067 --> 02:17:24.869
WHICH QUARTER HORSES RACE- IN

02:17:24.936 --> 02:17:33.345
FULL- WITH A- TOWBAR- BATTER

02:17:33.411 --> 02:17:35.680
THAT TECHNICALLY IS A LITTLE

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:39.117
OVER MY SKIS- BUT ALL I KNOW

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:43.622
THAT- THE BEST EXPERTS IN. THE

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:46.891
TRACK SURFACE WHEN ASKED TO LOOK

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:49.294
AT THIS LOOK AT IT IMMEDIATELY-

02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:52.097
AND THEY'VE LOOKED AT ALL LAST

02:17:52.163 --> 02:17:53.331
YEAR AND- THERE WAS A SPIKE

02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:56.001
AGAIN AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY I

02:17:56.067 --> 02:17:58.036
THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:17:58.103 --> 02:18:03.708
ACTUAL- OF THE LARGE BONE. BONES

02:18:03.775 --> 02:18:07.646
THAT HAVE BEEN- IN THE HORSES

02:18:07.712 --> 02:18:12.150
THEMSELVES FROM. EITHER

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:16.054
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS OR AND SO

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:17.222
WE'RE GETTING TO THE BTTOM OF

02:18:17.288 --> 02:18:20.825
IT. FUTURE B. IS ON IT EVERY DAY

02:18:20.892 --> 02:18:23.495
LOS AMIGOS CURRENTLY AND SO

02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:26.564
AGAIN. IF WE DON'T FEEL

02:18:26.631 --> 02:18:28.166
COMFORTABLE. THEY'VE GOT THIS

02:18:28.233 --> 02:18:29.868
FALL WHETHER IT'S THE TRACK

02:18:29.934 --> 02:18:31.169
SERVICE WE DON'T THINK IT'S THE

02:18:31.236 --> 02:18:35.040
TRACK SURFACE. BUT IF IT IS- OR

02:18:35.106 --> 02:18:37.208
WHAT OTHER REASONS THERE ARE WE

02:18:37.275 --> 02:18:40.311
WILL. CALL AN EMERGENCY MEETING

02:18:40.378 --> 02:18:42.247
ARE CHARMING TALKED ABOUT A WEEK

02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:45.050
AGO WE WERE IN A COUPLE WEEKS

02:18:45.116 --> 02:18:47.952
AGO ON WORK OR ALL OVER THE

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:49.354
FLOOR. THANK YOU HI. KNOW A LOT

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:50.989
GOES INTO IT AND I KNOW THE

02:18:51.056 --> 02:18:52.857
EVALUATION OF THE TRACKS AND

02:18:52.924 --> 02:18:54.325
THEN I KNOW WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS

02:18:54.392 --> 02:18:57.729
ON THE TRACK. ON RACE DAY AND-

02:18:57.796 --> 02:19:01.032
OBVIOUS YEAH. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:03.835
GETTING MORE. TOOLS I JUST HOPE

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:05.403
WE CONTINUE TO PUSH OURSELVES TO

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.238
DO BETTER AND BETTER AND TO

02:19:07.305 --> 02:19:09.340
FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE I KNOW

02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:11.710
THAT IT IS A SCIENCE- IN TERMS

02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:13.478
OF HOW THOSE TRACKS OR LOOKED AT

02:19:13.545 --> 02:19:15.647
BUT I. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE WE

02:19:15.714 --> 02:19:17.782
ALWAYS ARE GOING TO ASK WHEN WE

02:19:17.849 --> 02:19:19.984
SEE THIS BIKE AND WE ARE ALWAYS

02:19:20.051 --> 02:19:21.453
GOING TO BE WAITING FOR ANSWERS

02:19:21.519 --> 02:19:23.054
FROM THE- THE BOARD AND YOUR

02:19:23.121 --> 02:19:24.122
EXPERTS THAT TAKE A LOOK AT

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:26.524
THIS. I WILL FOLLOW UP ON A

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:30.028
QUESTION- THAT. SENATOR GROWTH-

02:19:30.095 --> 02:19:32.297
ASK ASK. AND TALKED ABOUT

02:19:32.363 --> 02:19:35.800
RELATED TO- BELFORD AND THE

02:19:35.867 --> 02:19:40.105
SUSPENSION- I WANTED HOW DO YOU

02:19:40.171 --> 02:19:42.373
BALANCE THE RIGHT OF DUE PROCESS

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.042
AND MONITORING OF TRAINERS WITH

02:19:44.109 --> 02:19:46.111
THE KNOWN HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS

02:19:46.177 --> 02:19:47.846
BECAUSE I READ IN SOME OF THE

02:19:47.912 --> 02:19:48.847
INFORMATION THAT THERE'S A

02:19:48.913 --> 02:19:50.749
LITTLE BIT OF A KNOWN HISTORY OF

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:52.350
PROBLEMS THERE. AND ALONG THOSE

02:19:52.417 --> 02:19:54.819
LINES THEN WHAT IS THE PLAN TO

02:19:54.886 --> 02:19:56.554
ENSURE THAT THESE HORSES ARE

02:19:56.621 --> 02:19:59.457
CARED FOR PROPERLY AT HAND I

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:01.159
KNOW AND HOW DOES THAT IMPACT

02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:02.761
EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE

02:20:02.827 --> 02:20:04.028
SOMEONE OF THAT STATURE WITH

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:05.964
THAT MANY COURSES. AND THEY'RE

02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:09.033
SUSPENDED IT HAS AN IMPACT ON

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:14.172
OBVIOUSLY- THE EMPLOYEES INTO

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:16.474
THE TRAINERS BECAUSE OF THE

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:19.377
ECONOMIC IMPACT BUT HOW ARE

02:20:19.444 --> 02:20:20.979
THOSE FORCES THEN. HOW DO YOU

02:20:21.045 --> 02:20:23.715
BALANCE THAT. AT THE MONITORING

02:20:23.782 --> 02:20:25.784
OF THE TRAINERS AS WELL AS AS

02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:28.787
DUE PROCESS. IN A CASE LIKE THIS

02:20:28.853 --> 02:20:31.189
IS MY THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:35.560
THAT. MISTER BAFFERT HAS ALREADY

02:20:35.627 --> 02:20:37.796
. BEEN SECURING HE SECURED TWO

02:20:37.862 --> 02:20:40.165
OTHER TWO TRAINERS TWO DIFFERENT

02:20:40.231 --> 02:20:42.967
TRAINERS THAT WILL TAKE OVER HIS

02:20:43.034 --> 02:20:47.005
ENTIRE STATE- YEAH SANTA ANITA.

02:20:47.071 --> 02:20:51.209
I WHICH IS PRIMARY BASE OF

02:20:51.276 --> 02:20:54.445
OPERATIONS- AND SOLD OF I

02:20:54.512 --> 02:20:56.714
FIGURES YOU KNOW HE'S HE HE HAS

02:20:56.781 --> 02:21:02.020
TO SHUT DOWN- AND SO I'M SURE

02:21:02.086 --> 02:21:03.555
THAT THE OTHER TRAINERS WILL TRY

02:21:03.621 --> 02:21:06.658
AND- GET A HIGHER HIS SOME OF

02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:09.194
HIS PEOPLE THERE THE- ACT

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:10.261
HANDLERS. OR SEIZE THE

02:21:10.328 --> 02:21:12.931
BACKSTRETCH WORKERS- IF NOT

02:21:12.997 --> 02:21:14.432
THEY'LL GET WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:16.801
YOU'RE ALWAYS NEEDED THERE'S

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:20.672
BEEN A SHORTAGE. OF BACKSTRETCH

02:21:20.738 --> 02:21:23.141
WORKERS. WE THINK BECAUSE A

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:27.345
COVERT SUCH SUCKS BUT- YOU KNOW

02:21:27.412 --> 02:21:28.980
. YOU MAY OR MAY NOT TELL THE

02:21:29.047 --> 02:21:31.249
CAT HORSE RACING HAS THE REST

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:34.485
RULE- WITH BEN WITH ALL STATE'S

02:21:34.552 --> 02:21:35.854
RACING AND WITH OTHER

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:38.156
COMMISSIONS RACING COMMISSIONS

02:21:38.223 --> 02:21:41.259
AND SO WE WILL LIVE BY WHATEVER

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:43.728
ELSE IS THE SUSPENSION OF NINETY

02:21:43.795 --> 02:21:46.097
DAYS OF THE KENTUCKY HORSE

02:21:46.164 --> 02:21:49.467

TO. OF THE STRAFFORD WE ALSO

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:55.707
WILL LIVE BY THAT AND UP WITH

02:21:55.773 --> 02:22:01.479
THIS RECIPROCITY RULES. I DON'T.

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:03.781
KNOW IF I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

02:22:03.848 --> 02:22:05.183
LIKE A PART OF YOUR QUESTION.

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:08.019
THANK YOU- I ONLY HAVE ONE LAST

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:09.754
QUESTION AND UNFORTUNATELY IT

02:22:09.821 --> 02:22:11.489
HAS TO DO WITH ANOTHER

02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:12.590
SUSPENSION WHICH IS THE EC ONE

02:22:12.657 --> 02:22:15.159
MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND I'LL BE

02:22:15.226 --> 02:22:16.995
QUITE HONEST I DIDN'T KNOW OF

02:22:17.061 --> 02:22:18.630
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:20.398
CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL

02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:21.933
BOARD AND THE CALIFORNIA HORSE

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.403
RACING BOARD. I WONDER I KNOW

02:22:25.470 --> 02:22:27.138
YOU'RE TWO VERY SEPARATE BOARDS

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:28.606
BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH THE

02:22:28.673 --> 02:22:32.277
SUSPENSION OF- THE DIRECTOR OF

02:22:32.343 --> 02:22:35.146
THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR- AND THEN

02:22:35.213 --> 02:22:37.348
OF COURSE THE HORSE RACING BOARD

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:39.017
HAS EXPRESSED GREAT CONFIDENCE

02:22:39.083 --> 02:22:41.819
IN IN. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR THE
