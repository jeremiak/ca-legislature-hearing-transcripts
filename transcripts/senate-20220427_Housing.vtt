00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:08.952
COUNTY CAME IN AND ASKED FOR AN

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:10.053

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.289
AND THEY GOT IT IT'S LIKE. THAT

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:14.758
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME- WE

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.760
PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.662
HAVE IS THAT WHEN COMMUNITIES

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.330
DON'T BUILD THEIR AFFORDABLE

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:21.865
HOUSING THEY PUSH THEM OUT TO

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:24.067
OTHER COMMUNITIES AND THAT PUSH

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:26.903
OUT IS CREATING- GREENHOUSE GAS

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:28.272
EMISSIONS EMISSIONS BECAUSE

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:30.040
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING FURTHER AND

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:32.376
FURTHER AWAY- AND IT'S PUSHING.

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:33.944
THE DISCUSSION ABOUT BIG MILES

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:37.681
TRAVELED AND THE ENTITIES THAT

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.883
ARE HAVING TO DO THAT SYSTEM

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.986
HAVE THE DIFF THE WITH IT ARE

00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:45.422
THERE A RURAL COMMUNITIES. ARE

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:46.790
STRUCTURE IN PLACE- THROUGH

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:48.625
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND SO I

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:50.027
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:51.862

ACTUALLY NEED THOSE UNITS-

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:07.978
ISSUES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE YOU

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:09.880

RESTROOMS HOW PLACE MANY. IN THE

00:58:04.447 --> 00:58:06.349
UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION OF NOT

USING FACILITIES THAT SORT OF

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:09.085
USING FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:10.153
DESIGNED WITH THEIR NEEDS IN

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.021
MIND AND I'LL GIVE YOU A

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:12.922
PERSONAL EXAMPLE I MEAN I'M I'M-

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:15.692
MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:16.292

OLD. AND- WE GET OFF AN AIRPLANE

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.064
FOR EXAMPLE AND REALLY

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:21.764
APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:23.132
THERE'S A FAMILY BATHROOM THAT'S

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.868
AVAILABLE WE GET OFF THE PLANE

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.836
SO WE CAN GET IN THERE I

00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:28.171
CERTAINLY WHEN- WHEN HE WAS

MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PARENTS.

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:43.219
SO ANYWAY I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:44.454
THAT RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE SAFE

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.656

GENDER IDENTITY. OUR THE

00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:52.662
CHALLENGE WE RUN INTO AND THIS

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:54.797
IS WHY THE BILL CAME TO US FROM

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:57.066
FROM THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD

00:58:57.133 --> 00:59:00.270
IS THAT EXISTING STATUTES- LIMIT

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:02.338
THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:04.374

ACCESS AND EFFICIENCY IN THE

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:09.312
SPACE SO THIS BILL GIVES LOCAL

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:10.813
GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.188
NOT A COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:41.557
THAT HAS GONE UNTOUCHED BY THE

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:42.524
HOMELESS CRISIS SWEEPING THE

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:44.560
STATE. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.328
CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT SEVENTEEN

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.263
BILLION DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.365

FIFTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ACROSS

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:54.203
FIFTEEN STATE ENTITIES WHY WE

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:55.604
HAVE BROUGHT OVERWHELMING

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.206
FINANCIAL FIRE POWER TO THE

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:59.375
PROBLEM THE PROBLEM HAS GROWN TO

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.643
NIGHT OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.479
THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WILL SLEEP

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.547

SIMPLY PUT THIS IS JUST NOT

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.218
RIGHT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:11.086
WITH THIS PICTURE THE CRISIS OF

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:13.589
HOMELESSNESS HAS REACHED SUCH A

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:14.823
MAGNITUDE AND THE SOLUTIONS WE

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.059
HAVE TRIED HAVE FAILED AT SUCH A

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.727
SCALE WE NEED AND ALL OF THE

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.963
ABOVE TYPE APPROACH TO OFFER

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.265
FRESH ALTERNATIVES. AS YOU ALL

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.833
KNOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.268
CALIFORNIA ADOPTED THE HOUSING

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:28.470
FIRST ONLY MODEL FOR ALL

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.105
PROJECTS WITH STATE FUNDING

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.040
WHILE I BELIEVE THERE ARE

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:33.375
CERTAINLY MANY CASES WERE

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.477
HOUSING FIRST IS THE NECESSARY

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.579
AND BENEFICIAL PROGRAM HOWEVER

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:40.182
PRIORITIZING AS THE SINGLE

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.017
SOLUTION PERMANENT HOUSING

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.252
CONSTRUCTION THAT WON'T BE

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.753
USABLE UNTIL THE NEXT STEP

SERVICES THAT CAN BRING SPRING

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:57.800
INTO ACTION TODAY IS THE WAY TO

01:13:57.866 --> 01:13:59.968
GO. SIX ALLEGE HAS RIGIDLY CLUNG

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:01.470
TO HOUSING FIRST ONLY WITHOUT

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:02.738

THE SMALLEST OF CARVE OUTS TO

HOUSING FIRST ONLY THE BILL

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:18.220
WOULD HAVE PROOF PROHIBITED

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:20.722
ALCOHOL AND DRUG USE. IN A

DESIGNATED HOUSING ONLY FOR SO

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:24.259
SHELTER FACILITY WHERE CHILDREN

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.230
UNDER A COURT ORDER TO REFRAIN

FROM USE OF THOSE SUBSTANCES AS

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:32.768
A CONDITION OF REUNIFICATION

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:35.904
WITH THEIR CHILDREN. THE BILL

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:37.940
COULD NOT EVEN GET A HEARING

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.708
DATE SET BECAUSE IT PROVIDED AN

EXCEPTIONTO THE HOUSING FIRST

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:43.545
REQUIREMENT. AND IGNORED THE

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:44.913
NEED FOR A SAFE AND SECURE

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.648
ENVIRONMENT FOR OTHER PEOPLE

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:48.617
PARENTS AND CHILDREN WHO ARE CO

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.986
LOCATED WITH SOMEONE ENGAGED IN

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:52.821
DRUG OR ALCOHOL MISUSE. FOR

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:54.723
CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:55.824
TRAUMA FROM DRUG AND ALCOHOL

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:58.026
ABUSE THIS ALL IN APPROACH TO

01:14:58.093 --> 01:14:59.661
HOUSING FIRST AND HOUSING FIRST

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.997

TRAUMA. THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR AND

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.036
CERTAINLY ARE NONE OF US NEED TO

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:10.305
SEE THAT HAPPEN. FOR EXAMPLE OUR

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:11.874
RIGID APPLICATION OF HOUSING

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.375
FIRST POLICY SHOULDN'T BE

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:15.177
SUBJECTING CHILDREN TO MORE

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:17.112
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES WHEN WE

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:18.347
KNOW HOW IMPORTANT TRAUMA

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:20.716
INFORMED CARE AREAS. WE NEED TO

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:21.950
BE OFFERING MORE OPTIONS NOT

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:24.052
FEWER. CALIFORNIA'S FORTY

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:25.721
MILLION PEOPLE ARE DIVERSE

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.322
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN ARE

01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:28.390
DIVERSE AND CALIFORNIA'S

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.359
HOMELESS POPULATION IS EQUALLY

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:32.327
DIVERSE WE MUST PROVIDE. A

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:33.695
PALETTE OF OPTIONS RATHER THAN

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:36.398
FORCE THE SAME. OUR SOLUTIONS ON

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:37.966
EVERY PERSON PROGRAMS AND

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.001
SHELTERS THAT REQUIRE

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:41.169
PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMMING.

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:42.704
AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES SHOULD

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:45.440
NOT BE EXCLUDED FROM AND ALL OF

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.175
THE ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPE

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:49.177
APPROACH. AS A FORMER SOCIAL

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:51.079
WORKER MYSELF I CAN TELL YOU

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.614
THAT WE KNOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:54.283
HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND WE TRY

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:56.118
TO ADDRESS THOSE OR SOME PEOPLE

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:57.252
ONLY NEED A PLACE TO STAY AT

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:59.054
NIGHT. OTHERS NEED AND WANT

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:00.789
ACCOUNTABILITY THE STATE'S

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:02.424
CURRENT APPROACH CONSTRAINS THE

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.059
OPTIONS AND OFFERS THAT THOSE

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:06.194
PEOPLE CAN GET. THAT IS NOT TO

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:07.529
SAY THAT ALL OF THE

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:08.630
LEGISLATURE'S ACTIONS HAVE

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:11.033
FAILED. BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN

OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY

GOT CALIFORNIANS OFF THE

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:36.391
EXEMPTION RUNS OUT AT THE END OF

TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SB TWELVE R.

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:39.661
EIGHTY FOUR WOULD REMOVE

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:40.862
BARRIERS FOR PROGRAMS THAT DO

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:41.964
NOT CONFORM TO HOUSING FIRST

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.066
REGULATIONS. AND ALLOW THEM TO

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.834
APPLY FOR STATE FUNDING AND IT

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.502
WOULD ALSO EXTEND THE SECRETIVE

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:49.538
SECRET EXEMPTION FOR SUPPORTIVE

01:16:49.604 --> 01:16:51.707
AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. SO

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.608
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN PLAN AND

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:54.543
IMPLEMENT SHELTERS WITH

SOBRIETY EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW

PEOPLE CANNOT GET SOBER WHILE

STILL HOMELESS. THEY COULD BE

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:51.019
DENIED HOUSING BECAUSE THE STATE

HOMELESSNESS AFTER SIX MONTHS

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:05.166
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM ONLY LASTS

SIX MONTHS. THE STATE

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:09.037

FIRST AS THE ONLY APPROACH FOR

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.398

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:39.701
ONLY MODEL THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.769

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:50.051
BACKFIRED BUT I'M KIND OF

01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:50.818
CURIOUS BECAUSE- MY ANDERSON

SAYING HERE THAT IT'S BEEN

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:58.326
PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE SO I

01:29:58.392 --> 01:30:00.294
WANNA UNDERSTAND THE DISCREPANCY

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.829
BETWEEN THE STATEMENT THAT WAS

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:03.865
MADE BY THE LEAD OPPOSITION AND

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:07.769
THE- AND THE HIDE GRAPH. THAT WE

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:13.040
HAVE. MAY I IN FACT THAT WAS THE

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:14.642
- SO YOUR QUESTION WAS TO THE

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.177
LEAD OPPOSITION YES THERE WAS

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:18.713
ONE OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION-

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.214
MAKING STATEMENTS TO THE FACT

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:22.049
THAT HOUSING FIRST HAD BEEN VERY

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:23.951
EFFECTIVE OKAY THAT WAS IN THIS

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.653
REPORT THIS REPORT SO MISTER

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.287
BRIDGEMAN RESPONDS CENTER CHOI

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:30.758
BOGUE. YES I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T

01:30:30.825 --> 01:30:33.127
SEEN THIS BEFORE SO- I THINK IN

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:35.129
GENERAL I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY.

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.298
THE TITLE OF IT BUT GENERALLY-

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:40.802
NATIONALLY- WE HAVE ADOPTED

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.637
HOUSING FIRST AS THE FEDERAL

01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:45.072
POLICY- FEDERAL HOMELESS

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:47.575
RESPONSE- AND HOMELESSNESS HAS

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:49.644
SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IF YOU

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:50.912
LOOK AT THE TIME THAT THAT

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:52.947
HAPPENS AND NOW IS THE INCREASE

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:55.483
BY AT LEAST 10% OF THANK YOU.

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:58.719
AND SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:00.087
GRAPH. IS SHOWING WITHOUT

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:01.956
LOOKING AT A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:31:02.023 --> 01:31:03.191
CLOSELY BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:05.259
DECREASED HOMELESSNESS. IN THE

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:06.494
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:08.062
HOMELESSNESS HAS INCREASED IN

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:11.399
CALIFORNIA- DESPITE ADOPTION OF

01:31:11.465 --> 01:31:12.733
HOUSING FIRST BUT THAT WAS WE

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.335
WERE ON THAT TRAJECTORY ARE

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.337
READY BEFORE. HOUSING FIRST WAS

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:18.573
ADOPTED- IT'S ONLY BEEN

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:21.342
IMPLEMENTED SINCE TWENTY

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:23.244
NINETEEN SO- I THINK THE ONLY

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:25.213
REASON WHY FEDERAL HOMELESSNESS

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:26.581
IS INCREASING IS ACTUALLY

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:28.616
BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:31.018
OUR HOUSING COSTS ARE SO HIGH SO

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:33.221
I'M THE GRAPHIC SHE HAS BOTH THE

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:36.123
FEDERAL AS A FEDERAL GRAPH HERE

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:38.459
AND IT ALSO HAS A CALIFORNIA SO

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:39.994
I'M JUST GONNA USE IN THE

01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:41.362
CALIFORNIA PART OF IT. NOT AS

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:43.898
MUCH- I MEAN WE SHOULD. ACTUALLY

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:45.766
NOW WE'RE REFERENCING CALIFORNIA

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:48.102
SO I AM MOSTLY INTERESTED IN

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:51.606
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- YOUR- YOUR

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.307
VERSION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:31:53.374 --> 01:31:55.476
SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM AND HIDES

01:31:55.543 --> 01:32:00.114
INTERPRETATION. OF THE- WHAT

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:02.049
THEY EXPRESS ARE AND I'M QUOTING

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:04.485
THE- JUST REFERENCING THIS

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:07.255
DIAGRAM THE ADDAMS. THE FAILED

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:09.523
EXPERIMENT AND- AND SECOND TO

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:10.992
THAT I'M I'M ALSO KIND OF

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:14.562
CURIOUS TO UNDERSTAND- THE END

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:16.364
OF THE PROGRAM IS ONLY BE

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:17.398
INSTITUTED SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:19.400
AND NINETEEN IN YOUR EXPERIENCE-

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:22.069
IN THIS SPACE HOW LONG SHOULD

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:24.705
WE- LOOK TO THE PROGRAM TO SEE

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:26.173
OR TO JUSTIFY ITS SUCCESS OR

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:29.610
FAILURE. ON ON THIS TYPE OF

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:30.511
PROGRAM- WELL THOSE ARE

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:32.947
EXCELLENT QUESTIONS I THINK THAT

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:35.049
AGAIN NATIONALLY HOMELESSNESS

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:36.183
HAS DECREASED SINCE

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:38.920
IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING FOR SO

01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:40.087
AGAIN I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:32:40.154 --> 01:32:42.590
THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:43.791
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:46.427
BEFORE- BUT IT HAS DECREASED IF

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:47.228
YOU LOOK AT THE HOMELESS

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:49.530
NUMBERS. WHEN IT WAS ADOPTED

01:32:49.597 --> 01:32:51.966
INTO A IN TWO THOUSAND SIX OR

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:53.901
SEVEN NATIONALLY HOMELESSNESS

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:56.003
HAS SIGNIFICANTLY GONE DOWN-

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:58.506
OVER THOSE YEARS CALIFORNIA I

01:32:58.572 --> 01:33:00.641
CANNOT ALREADY MA'AM I WANT TO

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:02.310
FOCUS IN CALIFORNIA- I

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:03.678
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:06.347
WITNESS ON THE PHONE- ONLINE

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:10.284

ABILITY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:12.787
AS WELL. IF IT THROUGH THE JACK

01:33:12.853 --> 01:33:13.921
THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE HEALTH.

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:16.590

ALWAYS GOOD TO HEAR FROM HER-

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:27.975
THE- THE CHALLENGES THEY CAN

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:29.510
ACCESS ANY STATE RESOURCES

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:31.278
BECAUSE- OF THAT HOUSING FIRST

01:37:31.345 --> 01:37:33.747
AND THEY HAVE A- REQUIREMENTS

01:37:33.814 --> 01:37:35.916
BECAUSE THEY HOUSE CHILDREN IN

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:37.418
THEIR FACILITY THEY HAVE

01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:38.419
REQUIREMENTS THAT. NO DRUGS OR

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:41.555
ALCOHOL- IN THE PROGRAM AND THEY

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:44.225
DO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION- A

01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:47.962
RELAPSE RELAPSING BECAUSE THAT'S

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:49.763
PART OF THE- PART OF THE

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:51.398
TREATMENT IS UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:54.134
RELAPSES OCCUR AND SO- I AM VERY

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:56.103
SENSITIVE TO THAT NEED TO BE

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:58.105
ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING- OTHER

01:37:58.172 --> 01:38:00.574
THAN HOST HOUSING FIRST- I'M NOT

01:38:00.641 --> 01:38:02.309
SURE THIS IS. THIS IS THE WAY TO

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:05.012
DO IT WHICH IS TO- ELIMINATED AS

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:07.581
AS THE PRIMARY PROGRAMS- BUT I

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:09.516
BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

01:38:09.583 --> 01:38:12.086
SOME PROGRAMS THAT- THAT IF WE

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:13.887
LOOKED AT THEM THROUGH THE LENS

01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:16.090
OF SUCCESS WE'D BE ABLE TO SAY

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:17.091
THAT THAT THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:19.326
AND- AND THAT THEY ACHIEVE THE

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:21.295
GOALS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REACH

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:22.129
WHICH IS TO GET PEOPLE INTO

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:25.165
PERMANENT HOUSING- SO. I AM I

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:27.101
CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL HERE

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:29.370
TODAY THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN- BUT

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:30.971
I CERTAINLY WOULD SUPPORT A

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.773
CARVE OUT OF THE PROGRAM FOR

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.675
THOSE PROGRAMS THAT THAT CAN

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:37.344
PROVE THAT THEIR- EVIDENCE BASED

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:40.648
IN THAT THERE'S THAT- A SUCCESS

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.750
RATE DOWN THAT. THAT DOWN THE

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:44.451
ROAD I'M I'M FRUSTRATED WITH

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:46.186
SOME OF OUR HOUSING- ARE

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:48.789
HOMELESS- PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:50.557
REALLY DON'T HAVE A REAL GOOD

01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:52.293
ANALYSIS OF HOW LONG PEOPLE ARE.

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:54.728
ARE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS AND

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:56.397
WHETHER THEY END UP FALLING BACK

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:57.865
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T PROVIDED THE

01:38:57.931 --> 01:39:00.234
SKILLS OR THAT- THE PROGRAMMING

01:39:00.301 --> 01:39:01.902
NECESSARY DID TO ENSURE THAT

01:39:01.969 --> 01:39:03.637
THEY WILL BE BACK ON ON THE

01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:05.639
STREETS WITHIN- A REAL SHORT

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:10.344
PERIOD OF TIME- I. SO AND SO. I

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:10.944
WISH YOU WOULD TAKE THE

01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:12.880
AMENDMENTS HAVE BECAUSE I ALSO

COMMENTS SENATOR KABIR MADE.

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:32.366
THAT YOU KNOW THE IT MAY BE VERY

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:34.735
IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY FOR THE

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.804
LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:37.938
WHETHER IT'S TO HOUSING FIRST OR

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.340
ANOTHER OF OUR POLICIES GIVEN

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:41.241
THAT WE HAVE. WE ARE VERY

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:43.344
COMMITTED TO WE'VE ALREADY BEEN

01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:44.745
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING OUR

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:48.215
FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS-

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:50.150
THE PROBLEMS OF HOMELESSNESS.

01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:51.785
AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.921
AND OF COURSE WE DO WANT TO MAKE

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.689
SURE THAT OUR MONEY IS BEING

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:57.191
SPENT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:59.393
REALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. BUT

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.528
I THINK IT'S MORE COMPLICATED.

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:03.897
THAN THAN THIS BILL. PRESENTS IN

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:08.369
TERMS OF THE SOLUTION. AND AND-

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:11.772
AT I GUESS WHAT I WOULD ASK IS

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:13.907
THAT AND I KNOW THAT OUR AND

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:15.743
CHEER HAS A GREAT INTEREST IN

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:18.545
THIS THAT WE AT SOME POINT WHEN

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:20.013
WE'RE NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF TRIED

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.850
TO DO BILLS THAT WE PERHAPS HAVE

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.118
AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING SO WE

01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:25.753
CAN BEGIN TO FLASH SOME OF THESE

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:27.054
THINGS SOUND IF THERE'S

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:27.888
APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:30.124
AND IT MAY NOT BE TO HOUSING

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:31.258
FIRST MAYBE TO ANOTHER ONE OF

01:40:31.325 --> 01:40:32.860
OUR PROGRAMS WITH THAT WE

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:34.561
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THIS. BUT

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:37.064
ANYWAY- I DON'T THINK THAT THIS

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:40.834
IS THE ANSWER AND I APPRECIATED

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:42.102
THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS AND

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:46.106
THEIR SUGGESTIONS BUT AGAIN AS-

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:50.477
THE IT'S THE BILL WOULD BE AS IT

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:52.646
IS I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.581

FISHER THANK YOU HAD A BILL A

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:06.760
FEW YEARS AGO AS WELL AND WHEN I

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:08.462
WAS CHAIRING THE HUMAN SERVICES

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:12.099
COMMITTEE- WITHOUT THE AMENDMENT

01:41:12.166 --> 01:41:14.501
AS- AS YOU AND I DISCUSSED I

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:16.437
CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL. IF THIS

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:17.971
WERE LIMITED TO THIS EXTENSION

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:20.140
OF THE SEQUEL EXAM EXAMS I WOULD

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:22.443
ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT I- BUT

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:24.778
THE ELIMINATION OF HOUSING FIRST

01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:27.548
AS A CRITIC AS A NO CORNERSTONE.

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:29.383
OF OUR HOUSING POLICY IS JUST

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.919
NOT SOMETHING THAT I CAN-

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:35.522
SUPPORT- I DO NOT REALLY TAKE

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.257
ISSUE WITH THIS GRAPHIC THAT WE

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:40.093
BEEN DISTRIBUTED THIS IS- I

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.129
THINK THAT'S TO BE BLIND  THINK

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:43.764
IT'S MISLEADING- THAT IT'S A

01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:46.600
CLASSIC CASE OF- CORRELATION

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:50.704
VERSUS. CAUSATION TO THE SICK I

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.106
DON'T KNOW JUST BECAUSE HOUSING

01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:54.208
FIRST WAS ADOPTED IN CERTAIN

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:55.976
YEAR EVEN THOSE YOU KNOW WASN'T

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:57.377
EVEN IMPLEMENTED A FEW YEARS

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.847
LATER. AND HOMES IS GOING UP

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:01.482
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HOUSING

01:42:01.548 --> 01:42:04.051
FIRST BECAUSE HOMELESSNESS TO GO

01:42:04.117 --> 01:42:06.453
OUT- I THERE'S NO INDICATION THE

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.488
HOUSING FIRST BECAUSE

01:42:07.554 --> 01:42:09.957
HOMELESSNESS- TO GO UP HOUSING

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:11.391
FIRST PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM

01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:13.126
BECOMING A RELAXING ON THE

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:15.195
HOMELESSNESS OF WHAT HAS BEEN

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:16.930
HAPPENING THE LAST NUMBER OF

01:42:16.997 --> 01:42:18.966
YEARS IS THAT CALIFORNIA

01:42:19.032 --> 01:42:20.467
CONTINUES. ON TO FALL FURTHER

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:22.369
AND FURTHER BEHIND OUR NEEDED

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:25.272
HEALTH STOCK- WE RANK FORTY NINE

01:42:25.339 --> 01:42:27.074
OUT OF FIFTY STATES AND HOMES

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.575
FOR CAPITAL WE'RE SHORT

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:29.843
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND A HALF

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:31.245
AND THREE AND A HALF MILLION

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.980
HOMES WERE PRODUCING EACH YEAR

01:42:33.046 --> 01:42:35.215
APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE HOMES

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:37.184
THAT WE NEED TO BE PRODUCING.

01:42:37.251 --> 01:42:38.719
EVERY YEAR COMMUNITIES AROUND

01:42:38.785 --> 01:42:41.989
CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO OBSTRUCT

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.423
THE CREATION OF NEW HOUSING

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.259
CONTINUE TO VIOLATE STATE LAW

01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:51.765
BRAZENLY. CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:53.534
LOOPHOLES. OUR CONTINUE TO DO

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.134
THINGS. LIKE- PROCLAIM THEIR

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:56.203
CITY BE I'M MALE AND LION

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:57.738
HABITAT WORD A PRICKLY THEIR

01:42:57.804 --> 01:42:58.972
ENTIRE C. TO BE RISE TO.

01:42:59.039 --> 01:43:01.942
DISTRICT OR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:03.610
SHENANIGANS THAT CITIES ARE

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:06.013
USING. TO AVOID- CREATING

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:08.849
HOUSING- THAT'S WHY HOMELESS

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.651
NUMBERS RE GOING UP BECAUSE WE

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:13.787
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING PERIOD

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:14.821
. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF HOUSING

01:43:14.888 --> 01:43:16.423
FIRST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BUILDING

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:18.458
ENOUGH HOUSING AT EVERY INCOME

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:21.562
LEVEL- AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK IN

01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:24.264
THE MIRROR AND- DECIDE IF WE

01:43:24.331 --> 01:43:25.866
REALLY ARE COMMITTED. TO

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:28.635
PRIORITIZING. THE BASIC CONCEPT

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:30.671
THAT WISH THAT EVERYONE SHOULD

01:43:30.737 --> 01:43:34.274
HAVE ACCESS TO A HOME- I HAVE

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:35.809
NOTHING AGAINST SAINT JOHN I'VE

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:37.644
ONLY HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:39.379
SOME OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE

01:43:39.446 --> 01:43:40.714
DONE- AND SAINT JOHN CAN

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:42.416
CONTINUE WITH THAT SMALL HOUSING

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:45.519
WE DON'T BAN. ORGANIZATIONS FROM

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:47.154
HAVING WE OR DON'T WE DON'T

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:50.090
MANDATE THAT ALL HOUSING- FOR

01:43:50.157 --> 01:43:51.658
ALL NONPROFITS HAVE TO BE

01:43:51.725 --> 01:43:53.627
HOUSING FIRST. BUT IF YOU WANT

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:55.562
TO GET STATE FUNDING YOU HAVE TO

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:56.930
BE AND YOU CAN'T TAKE SOMEONE

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:59.600
OUT ON THE STREET BECAUSE THE

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:00.867
RELAPSE. THAT'S CALIFORNIA

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:03.270
HOUSING POLICY. BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:44:03.337 --> 01:44:05.672
DO RELAPSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO

01:44:05.739 --> 01:44:07.007
RELAPSE BUT IF THEY DO. THEY

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:09.543
SHOULD HAVE BECOME HOMELESS AS A

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:10.110
RESULT THAT DOESN'T BENEFIT

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:12.212
ANYONE. IT MAKES IT HARDER TO RE

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:14.214
HOUSE- IT INCREASES TAXPAYER

01:44:14.281 --> 01:44:18.085
COSTS. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH-

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:20.354
SO UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT- THE

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.756
AMENDMENTS THAT WE REQUESTED- I

01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:24.925
WILL BE OPPOSING- THE BILL

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:27.894
TODAY- AND- SENATOR YOU MAY

01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:30.664
CLOSE. I THANK YOU AND THANK YOU

01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:32.299
FOR ALL THE DISCUSSION AND

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:34.067
CERTAINLY IT DEBATING OF. THE

01:44:34.134 --> 01:44:37.838
STATISTICS THAT SHOW UP ON. A

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:43.310
FARM. AS AS WE HAVE HERE THE FOB

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:46.346
. ANALYSIS OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:48.315
JUST AUTOMATICALLY SAY THAT THAT

01:44:48.382 --> 01:44:50.717
IS CAUSE AND EFFECT AND I DIDN'T

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:52.386
MEAN IT TO BE INCLUDED BUT IT

01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:54.154
CERTAINLY SHOWS THAT WE ARE

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.455
EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN

01:44:55.522 --> 01:44:57.024
HOMELESSNESS AND WITH THE

01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:59.960
HOMELESS ENOUGH FIRST UP PLUS

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:02.362
POLICY I THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:04.164
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE VERY

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:05.832
TRAGIC THINGS THAT HAPPENED

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:07.467
ENOUGH FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:09.336
ESTABLISHED AND HAVE RESIDENTS

01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:13.473
THAT ARE. ARE SPECIFICALLY- WITH

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:17.077
ISSUES AYE AYE I'D LIKE TO REFER

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:18.278
TO AN ARTICLE THAT APPEARED

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:19.646
RECENTLY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:22.249
CHRONICLE I BELIEVE WE'RE- IN

01:45:22.315 --> 01:45:23.917
THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO ALONE

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:25.052
MORE THAN TEN PEOPLE A MONTH

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.586
THAT WERE IN CITY SUPPORTING

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:28.088
HOUSING FACILITIES AND SHELTER

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:29.956
IN PLACE. HOTELS AND THESE ARE

01:45:30.023 --> 01:45:32.693
HOUSING FIRST POLICY FACILITIES

01:45:32.759 --> 01:45:35.529
IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:36.863
TWENTY ONE THE DIED OF DRUG

01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:38.699
OVERDOSES BECAUSE THERE WAS

01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:40.634
NOTHING THERE SUPPORTIVE. ARM

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.135
I'D LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:44.604
THIS BILL IN THE APPROACH I'M

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:46.339
TAKING HERE IS NOT TO ELIMINATE

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:48.141
HOUSING FIRST AYE. I THINK

01:45:48.208 --> 01:45:51.078
THERE'S WAYS TO SET A FINANCIAL-

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:53.747
COMPONENT INTO A BILL LIKE THIS

01:45:53.814 --> 01:45:54.815
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT A

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:57.617
PILOT PROJECT- HOUSING FIRST

01:45:57.684 --> 01:45:59.119
PLUS FACILITIES WOULD BE

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.987
ELIGIBLE TAX DOLLARS AND HOUSING

01:46:01.054 --> 01:46:03.890
FIRST ONLY. ARE THERE- THEIR

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:05.892
FINANCIAL GRANTS WOULD NOT BE

01:46:05.959 --> 01:46:07.627
IMPACTED THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:08.995
HAVE TO BE LOOKED OUT AND I

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.664
WOULD HOPE I WOULD HAVE HOPED

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:12.299
THAT GOING FORWARD IF I DON'T

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:13.900
HAVE THE VOTES WE COULD. WE

01:46:13.967 --> 01:46:14.935
COULD BE ADDRESSING SOME OF

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:16.837
THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE IT IS

01:46:16.903 --> 01:46:19.573
CLEARLY NOT AN ATTEMPT TO YEAH.

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:22.275
S. FIRST POLICY AS A PLEASURE- I

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:23.610
ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN THAT

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:26.046
BEFORE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:27.781
A STATE POLICY BECAUSE I- THERE

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:29.983
WAS ONE OF THE DIRECTORS SOB. IN

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:31.418
THE GENERAL RELIEF PROGRAM AS IT

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:33.120
WAS CALLED WE WERE FREQUENTLY

01:46:33.186 --> 01:46:35.355
GIVING HOUSING VOUCHERS TO PUT

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:37.791
PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND HAD

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.626
ALCOHOLIC DICTION IN INTO

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:41.561
SINGLE. OUR RESIDENTS ONLY

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:43.730
FACILITIES AND DOWN REFERRING

01:46:43.797 --> 01:46:46.032
THEM TO A VARIETY OF. COMMUNITY

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:48.168
ARE BASED- TREATMENT FACILITIES

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:49.002
AND MANY OF THOSE THEY NEVER

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:51.037
ATTENDED AND THAT'S PART OF THE

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:52.572
PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE AN

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:53.673
INDIVIDUAL WHO SAYS I'VE GOT A

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.609
PROBLEM AND I NEED

01:46:55.675 --> 01:46:57.611
ACCOUNTABILITY I NEED TO BE IN A

01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:58.311
FACILITY THAT WILL HELP ME

01:46:58.378 --> 01:47:03.517
ACHIEVE. ALL THE THINGS THAT.

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:04.518
THING FIRST PLUS WOULD PROVIDE

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:06.720
AND LET ME SHARE THOSE YOU GET

01:47:06.787 --> 01:47:07.788
MENTAL. CIRCLE HEALTH TREATMENT

01:47:07.854 --> 01:47:09.022
TO GET LIFE SKILLS PARENTING

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:11.258
SKILLS JOB EDUCATION JOB

01:47:11.324 --> 01:47:12.993
TRAINING HOW TO DRESS HOW TO

01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:15.228
INTERVIEW AT CETERA. AND THESE

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:16.930
ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:19.232
DENIED SOMEONE WHO SELLS I NEED

01:47:19.299 --> 01:47:20.767
TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY I WANT TO

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:22.235
BE SOMEWHERE. WHERE I CAN

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:24.204
RECEIVE THIS AND WE ARE ACTUALLY

01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:25.572
ELIMINATING FACILITIES THAT

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.107
PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:28.842
BE FUNDED SO I THINK WE SHOULD

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:30.510
TAKE THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION.

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:32.245
AND PROVIDE A WAY THAT HOUSING

01:47:32.312 --> 01:47:34.781
FIRST ONLY IS FUNDED FOR THOSE

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:36.817
AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S WHAT- I

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:38.885
THINK THE STATISTICS SHOW ABOUT

01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:40.387
34% OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:47:40.453 --> 01:47:41.555
HOMELESS OUT THERE IT'S AN

01:47:41.621 --> 01:47:43.557
ECONOMIC. ISSUE THEY LOST THEIR

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:45.859
JOB AGE VETERANS RETURNING

01:47:45.926 --> 01:47:49.062
WHATEVER BUT 74% IN THE THIRD.

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:50.130
GOING BACK TO THE CHARTS THAT

01:47:50.197 --> 01:47:52.132
SHOW. YOU KNOW HOW HOW IT'S

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:53.700
GROWN THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:55.535
SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:47:55.602 --> 01:47:57.270
SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AND

01:47:57.337 --> 01:47:57.938
THEY'RE IN OUR LOCAL

01:47:58.004 --> 01:47:59.906
COMMUNITIES. AND I SUGGEST THAT

01:47:59.973 --> 01:48:01.074
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LOCAL

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:03.043
GOVERNMENTS NEED ANOTHER TOOL.

01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:07.047
HOUSING ONLY PLUS HOUSING FIRST

01:48:07.113 --> 01:48:09.149
PLUS POLICY WOULD ALLOW LOCAL

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:11.117
GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE. ARE A HUGE

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:13.153
IMPACT I BELIEVE YESTERDAY THE

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:15.288
MAYORS OF LARGE CITIES ACTUALLY

01:48:15.355 --> 01:48:15.989
APPEALED FOR SOMETHING LIKE

01:48:16.056 --> 01:48:17.858
THIS. SO I'M JUST ASKING US TO

01:48:17.924 --> 01:48:19.926
TAKE A SECOND LOOK. MAYBE NOT IN

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:22.028
THIS ROUND BUT GOING FORWARD IF

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:22.863
SOMETHING I THINK IS REALLY

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.798
VITAL TO REALLY GETTING AT THE

01:48:24.865 --> 01:48:26.533
HEART OF OUR HOMELESS PROBLEM.

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:27.734
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ALL

01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:29.836
ARE ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM WOULD

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:31.671
LOVE TO AND HOMELESS. ENOUGH NO

01:48:31.738 --> 01:48:36.076
QUESTION. AND THERE ARE OTHER

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:37.177
HOT. TECHNIQUES THERE ARE OTHER

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:38.378
PROGRAMS THAT ARE ACHIEVING THAT

01:48:38.445 --> 01:48:39.713
AND WE SHOULD EMBRACE THOSE THAT

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.948
SHOULD NOT BE A SINGLE. APPROACH

01:48:42.015 --> 01:48:43.149
ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

01:48:43.216 --> 01:48:44.718
THAT THEY'RE OING TO LOSE OUR

01:48:44.784 --> 01:48:46.519
FUNDING ON THAT THAT WOULD NOT

01:48:46.586 --> 01:48:47.921
GO AWAY. SO WITHOUT TOM I THANK

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:49.623

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:51.524
