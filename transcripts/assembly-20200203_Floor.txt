PASS AND RETAIN ON FILE ITEM SIX MOVING TO FILE ITEM SEVEN SB TWO OH SEVEN THE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL TWO OH SEVEN BY SENATOR D'AMATO ND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE TO ELECTIONS CLEARLY ZERO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY THIS. THIS CAN SALAS YOU ARE A- THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES WE'VE HEARD A LOT THE NEWS LATELY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO. MIGHT THINK THEY'RE ONE PARTY BUT REGISTERED ANOTHER REGISTER NO PARTY PREFERENCE WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE- ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN APARTMENTS MOVE BEFORE ELECTION DAY AND YET TODAY THE WAY THE BILL THE LAW IS WRITTEN IF THOSETHINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND YOU GO TO THE POLLS ON ELECTION DAY YOU HAVE TO CAST A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO WILL ALLOW YOU TO ATTEST TO CHANGES SUCH AS MOVING WITHIN A COUNTY OR A CHANGE OF A POLITICAL PARTY PREFERENCE ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION AT A POLLING PLACE AND ALLOW YOU CAST A TRADITIONAL BALLOT. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT OUR BALLOTS ARE COUNTED IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER ANYBODY THAT WATCH WHAT HAPPENED LAST LIKE XIN CYCLE AS THAT THINGS BACKED UP IN THE NUMBER PROVISIONAL BALLOTS BACKED UP IT WAS A GOOD FOR ANYONE. ALTHOUGH I'M THE REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T OPPOSE ON THIS POSITION I WOULD KNOW THAT IT IS IN FACT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT REQUIRES PEOPLE TO REGISTER IS REPUBLICAN IN ORDER TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS SO IT IN FACT HELPED OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY I DURING THE SELECTION WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. IN YOU MISS OUT. MR KILEY WERE. THINK ABOUT AS BIG I I'M IN SOME OF BILL I THINK THAT CONCERN THE BEEN RAY ABOUT VOTER FRAUD ARE NOT A SERIOUS IN THIS IS A SO OTHERS I THINK ANY ELECTION OFFICE I CAN EASILY AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING VOTES BY SIMPLY INVALIDATING ANY ABSENTEE BALLOT THAT COMES IN FOR SOMEONE WHO IS ALREADY VOTED ON ELECTION DAY THE BENEFIT SEE TO THIS BATTLE IS IT SOME MINOR IMPROVEMENTS A PROBLEM IN OUR STATE THAT I BELIEVE HAS BECOME QUITE SEVERE AND THAT'S THE PROTRACTED. NATURE BOTH OF BEING AN ACCOUNT EACH OF WHICH ALLOW THIRTY DAYS BEFORE AND AFTER ELECTION DAY IN CALIFORNIA I BECOME INCREASINGLY CONCERNED THAT THIS RAISES SERIOUS ISSUES AROUND DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY I JUST LOOK MOST DRAMATIC EXAMPLE OF THE ON GOING ENSURE BASE WE HAVE SOME VOTING START THIS WEEK. TO CONTINUE VOTE IN UP AND EARLY PART ABOUT THAT GOING TO HAVE. IN THAT TIMES FOR YOUR HAVE CANNOT DROP OUT OF THE RIGHT. SO PEOPLE WILL BE. IN LITERALLY DE ELECTIONS YET THOUGH JUST BE ONE SINGLE TALLY ALTHOUGH THAT TALLY WILL NOT BE FINALIZED UNTIL WEEKS AFTER ELECTION DAY EVEN THOUGH ON ELECTION NIGHT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME REPORTING AS TO WHO'S AHEAD. AND THAT MAY WELL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE PERSON WHO ULTIMATELY HAS A LEAD ONCE ALL THE BALLOTS HAVE BEEN COUNTED WE DON'T KNOW IN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES THINGS LIKE MOMENTUM AND NARRATIVES OFTEN MATTER MORE THAN THE ACTUAL ASSIGNMENTS. OF DELEGATES SO ARE VOTE COUNTING SYSTEM CREATES THIS POTENTIAL TO SORT OF SKEW ELECTION OUTCOMES- THROUGH FALSE NARRATIVES AND FALSE MOMENTUM SO I THINK THIS BILL WILL HELP A LITTLE BIT. BY ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY AND ASSURING THOSE BALLOTS ARE COUNTED ON THAT DAY RATHER THAN SET ASIDE AS PROVISIONALS ALTHOUGH I THINK WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO ON WINE. THE MASS ARE ELECTIONS CODE HAS MADE AND MOVED BACK TOWARDS THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL OF ELECTIONS. I OUT ONCE AND OUR THE RESULT BEING RUDE RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISSING DOLLARS YOU MAY CLOSE.
