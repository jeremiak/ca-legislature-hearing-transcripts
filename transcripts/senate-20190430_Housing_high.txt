DON'T REQUIRE ME THAT BUT WE'RE GOING TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- IF EVERYONE COULD PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONES AND IF YOU HAVE ANY CONVERSATIONS ON THE SIDE PLEASE TAKE IT OUT IN THE HALLWAY -- WE ARE -- FIVE MEASURES ON TODAY'S AGENDA -- PLEASE KNOW THAT ITEMS FOUR AND FIVE SB SIX FIFTY TWO SB -- SEVEN FIFTY ONE ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR SO WE'LL TAKE THAT UP WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM -- SO FOR THE THREE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE TODAY WE WERE DOING FILE ORDER I'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER ONE SB TWO FIFTY TWO BY CENTER LEYVA. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT SB TWO FIFTY TWO WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR PRIVATE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS TO SELL THEIR PARK TO THE RESIDENTS A NONPROFIT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ENTITY OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS WE ARE ALL WELL AWARE CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING A SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS DUE TO THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S MOBILE HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOMES ARE AN IMPORTANT OPTION HOUSING OPTION IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST STRIVE TO RESERVE THE AVAILABLE MOBILE HOME STOCK. SOME NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARTNERS ARE INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PURCHASING PARTS FROM LONGSTANDING BUSINESS OWNERS. THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS WHEN THEY'RE PARK OWNERS DECIDE TO RETIRE. LEAVE THE INDUSTRY AND SELL THEIR PARKS WHEN THIS OCCURS RESIDENTS FACE STEEP RENT INCREASES OR EVEN DISPLACEMENT WITH FEW OPTIONS OF WHERE TO MOVE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A DEDICATION OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO THE PARK OWNER WHO MAY WISH TO LEAVE THE BUSINESS AND NOT WANT TO DISPLACERESIDENTS. THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM FOR THE PARK OWNERS AND NOT A FORCED SALE. IF THE PARK OWNER CELLS ARE PROPERTY OF MARKET RATE THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE 450% OF THEIR CAPITAL GAINS EXCLUSION. IF THE PARK OWNER SELLS BELOW MARKET RATE THEY COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR UP 21100% OF CAPITAL GAINS EXCLUSION. MEMBERS SB TWO FIFTY TO HELP PROTECT THIS LIMITED STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND KEEPS LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND OUR SENIORS OFF THE STREETS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN BEFORE I INTRODUCED MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO LET EVERYONE KNOW HOW MANY MOBILE HOME PARKS THEY HAVE IN THEIR DISTRICT. SENATOR WIENER YOU ONLY HAVE FOR PARKS WITH SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE SPACES. SENATOR MORE LOCK YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETEEN WITH TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT SPACES. SENATOR ROTH YOU HAVE SIXTY EIGHT WAS SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND ONE SPACES. SENATOR UMBERG I THINK YOU'RE THE WINNER OF WHO'S HERE RIGHT NOW WITH EIGHTY SEVEN AND TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN SPACES AND I JUST ALWAYS LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE THAT THEY HAVE SO MANY MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THEIR DISTRICT. AND THESE ARE FOLKS THAT WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT SO WITH THAT I WOULD LOVE TO INTRODUCE A MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ROB WIENER OF CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RURAL HOUSING IS A SPONSOR AND REPRESENTS MANY NONPROFIT HOUSING ENTITIES. SUZANNE TAYLOR OF AUGUSTA'S PROPERTIES WHICH I HAVE TO WORK THEY ARE LOVELY MANAGES AND OPERATES NONPROFIT MOBILE HOME PARKS. WITH THAT WHEN YOU'RE READY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IN SUPPORT. HI MY NAME IS SUZANNE TAYLOR -- THEY HAVE I'M GONNA READ FROM MY PREPARED REMARKS IF THE CHAIR. YES IF YOU WOULD BE VITAL LIMITED TO ABOUT THREE MINUTES OKAY GREAT THANK YOU I AM THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A GUST COMMUNITIES IT'S A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATION. THAT WAS FOUNDED TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE OPPORTUNITIES IN MANUFACTURED HOUSING. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND BOTH REDEVELOPMENT SETTING OUTSIDE THEIR REDEVELOPMENT SETTING I ALSO DO CONSULTING SERVICES FOR INVESTOR OWNED. AND OTHER NON. PROFIT PARKS. AUGUSTA IS SERVICE RIGHT NOW HUNDRED RESIDENTS IN A COMMUNITIES ACROSS VENTURA SANFORD SANFORD INDIANA ORANGE AND TULARE COUNTIES WE ALSO -- OPERATE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LA HABRA TWO OF THEIR OF CITY ON PARKS. IN MANY OF THESE -- LOCALITIES MANUFACTURED HOME AS SENATOR LEYVA MENTIONED I'M REPRESENT THE LARGEST STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR IN THEIR AREA SO THIS WORK IS MEANINGFUL AND SIGNIFICANT. WITHOUT THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO NON PROFITS -- THAT THAT WERE AVAILABLE IN THE REDEVELOPMENT YEARS IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO COMPETE WITH DEEPER. DEEP POCKET INVESTMENT GROUPS OUR PRIMARY COMPETITION THESE DAYS ARE NONTRADITIONAL BUYERS SUCH AS HAD VARIOUS HEGE FUNDS YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN READING ABOUT. AND WHO HAVE AGGRESSIVE BUSINESS PLANS CAN FUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOME REPLACEMENTS AND HAVE ACCESS TO BETTER ACQUISITION FINANCING. ANY TO THE LEGISLATURE CAN PROVIDE IS VALUABLE TO US KEEPING THESE FORMS OF THESE HOMES AFFORDABLE. DESPITE ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR PROJECTS ON A DAILY BASIS THE LAST PURCHASE A CUSTOM MADE WAS THREE YEARS AGO IN A GOOD YEAR THEIR BABY MAYBE ONE TWO OR THREE PARKS PURCHASED BY ANY OF THE NON PROFITS MOST EXPERIENCED IN THESE MOBILE HOME PARKS AND THAT'S A COLLECTIVE NUMBER. JUST A COUPLE AT A TIME HERE AND THERE THESE DAYS -- WITH THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAM I THINK WE COULD GET TO A COUPLE MORE EACH YEAR AND THAT SOUNDS MAYBE JUST LIKE A FEW BUT IT REALLY ADDS UP SO IF YOU. GO FROMONE PARK TO PARK A YEAR TO FIVE PARKS YEAR. THAT'S AN INCREASE OF AND LET'S JUST SAY THEY'RE SMALL THEY'RE HUNDRED SPACE PARKS THAT'S AN INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED AFFORDABLE SPACES WITH WITH AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS OVERLAID. AND A POPULATION OF MAYBE A THOUSAND FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR MORE. AGAINST THIS IS MEANINGFUL. IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THREE PARTS OF INTEREST TO US THAT WE FELT WE COULD FINANCE AND OPERATE ACCORDING TO OUR MISSION. IN EACH CASE THE SELLER'S ACCEPTED OFFERS OVER THE VALUATION PRICE -- ONE THAT WE BELIEVED WE COULD SUPPORT OFFERED QUICK CLOSING AND OFFERED EXCHANGE PROPERTIES SO IF THERE'S ANY OTHER IDEAS YOU HAVE TO COMBAT THAT TYPE OF COMPETITION AND TO PRESERVE THESE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WE APPRECIATE IT. THIS INCENTIVE IS NOT COSTLY TO THE STATE. THAT IS BECAUSE IN OUR ESTIMATION SELLO SELLERS TYPICALLY DON'T SELL UNLESS THEY FIND. DON'T SELL UNLESS THEY CANNOT FIND AN EXCHANGE PROPERTY. OR SELL TO READ IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OR OTHER LITERATURE LEGITIMATE TAX AVOIDANCE PROP PURPOSES THIS HELPS US AT LEAST GET AN EDGE. I THINK THIS INCENTIVE WILL KNOWLEDGE SOME SELLERS WHO WON OUT OF THE BUSINESS. AND MAY HAVE. THE COMPASSION FOR THEIR THEIR RESIDENTS AND WANT TO HELP THE MOVE FORWARD TO KEEP THEIR HOMES. IT WILL NOT SELLERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE CLOSER PARK OR ATTEMPT TO SELL TO ANOTHER USE OR TO CONVERT TO ANOTHER USE AND THEY WOULD PRESERVE THOSE HOMES IN THE PROCESS AS WELL. AND IT WOULD PROVIDE AN IMPETUS FOR THOSE SELLERS WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED OR DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. TO SELL THE PARK AND AS YOU HAVE TOURED PROBABLY YOUR MOBILE HOME PARKS IN YOUR DISTRICT YOU'LL SEE THAT WHEN WE STARTED THIS TWENTY YEARS AGO. PARKS WERE IN GOOD CONDITION AND THEIR THEIR EIGHTEEN RAPIDLY TWENTY YEARS ON A MOBILE HOME PARK IS MEANINGFUL -- AND IT REQUIRES A LOT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT. THAT'S REALLY ALL THE FOR PREPARING YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MR ACOSTA BEFORE WE START WITH YOU -- BUT WE DO HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THIS BILL -- WELL I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. SENATOR WINNER PRESENT WIENER PRESENT MORRELL BATES HERE BATES PRESENT CAMERA. CAMERA PRESENT DORADO. REQUIRE MORE LOOK. MORE LIKE PRESENT ROUGH. ROUGH PRESENT SKINNER UMBERG. UNDER PRESENT CASKEY CASKEY PRESENT. OKAY WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. OKAY SIR CHRISTOPHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I PICKED UP ON YOUR Q. THERE SO I WOULD JUST SAY -- BRIAN AUGUSTA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RURAL HOUSING PLEASE TO CO SPONSOR THE BILL THE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TOOL FOR PRESERVING. AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES IN MOBILE HOME PARKS AND WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD. LOUIS MARIN DAY WITH CALIFORNIA BE WE DIDN'T GET OUR LETTER IN ON TIME BUT DO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. YOUR ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. CASEY NOT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY WORRY ABOUT THE COMMITTEE -- CENTER ROTH HAS MOVED THE BILL ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND NOW CENTER LIVE AYE I REALLY. LIKE THIS BILL -- MIGHT THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IT'S IT'S TWO FOLD ONE IS -- AND I I DID BROACH THIS WITH STAFF AND IT'S IN REGARDS TO RENT INCREASES -- AND THERE'S A AT LEAST THE AND IDEA THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FUNDING FROM A PUBLIC SOURCES IN THOSE PUBLIC SOURCES USUALLY HAVE AFFORDABILITY -- WRITERS ON THEM I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT UP DISPLACING PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THAT IN THE PARKS AND SO. YOU KNOW AS YOU MOVE ALONG IF YOU CAN LOOK AT THE KIND OF PROTECTIONS THAT MIGHT BE -- MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE I I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO THINK ABOUT THEM I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION SO -- THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT -- IT MAY IN THE MANY TIMES -- YOU KNOW WE COME UP WITH WITH A GOOD IDEA TO TO FORM COOPERATIVES AND AND ALLOW PEOPLE -- TO THE IT LIKE IN EACH A WAYS -- TO GO TO MANAGING CONTROL IT THEMSELVES AND WHEN MY EXPERIENCE IN MY COMMUNITY IS THAT WHEN IT IT INVOLVES A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. THERE'S A REAL NEED TO HAVE SOME PROFESSIONAL ADVICE AVAILABLE BECAUSE INVARIABLY THEY GET THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LAWS ARE AND THE SOME PEOPLE WILL NOT END UP PAYING THEIR DUES -- IF YOU DON'T COLLECT THEM IN A TIMELY WAY THEN YOU FALL WAY BEHIND YOU DON'T HAVE THE CAPITALIZATION TO MAKE THE THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE TO THE PARK OR TO THE JOINTLY OWNED PROPERTY AND SO. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PROFESSIONAL OVERSIGHT AND SO I JUST I PUT THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE WE'VE. IN MANY INSTANCES HAVE HAD -- TO GO IN AND HELP OUT THE H. ALWAYS OR THAT THE TENANTS IN A WAY THAT -- AS A CITY IN A WAY THAT WE NEVER EXPECTED TO HAVE TO SPEND PUBLIC DOLLARS IN A PRIVATE -- ENDEAVOR AND THERE'S THERE'S YOU HAVE TO IF YOU WANT THOSE. UP FACILITIES TO CONTINUE TO BE AFFORDABLE SO I I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANY -- COMMITMENTS RIGHT NOW BUT I I'M I'M VERY COGNIZANT OF THE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PROTECTING THE THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO CREATE CREATE AND CONTINUED. AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU US SENATE CARRERA APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS -- THIS IS MY FIFTH YEAR IS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MOBILE MANUFACTURED HOMES AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT ARE ISSUES THAT WE HEAR WHEN WE HAVE TOWN HALLS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. H. ALWAYS -- I'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT H. ALWAYS AND I PROBABLY CARE TO KNOW -- BUT WE THAT IT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN AND TO YOUR FIRST POINT -- WITH THE RISING RENTS THIS BILL WOULD NOT CHANGE ANYTHING THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE SO IF IT IS -- THAT IT CHANGES OWNERSHIP AND GOES TO A NONPROFIT THIS WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT BUT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THOSE ARE AL THINGS ARE AT THE TOP OF OUR MIND AS WELL FEDERAL WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I ALSO LIKE THE IDEA I JUST. IT WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATED SO WHEN I READ TO THE BILL LAST YEAR ELEVEN SIXTEEN WHICH WOULD DIE. GIVE A FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS THE ABILITY. TO BUY A HOME IF THE SELLER WAS WILLING. TO SELL TO A FIRST TIME HOME BUYER TO INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL GAINS. EXEMPTION AMOUNT A LITTLE BIT. SO THAT THE STATEBENEFITS A TAX EXPENDITURE. SO I'M I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THIS WILL MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE MY BILL WENT THROUGH COMMITTEE BUT DIED IN APPROACH. SO. I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE WHO WHO'S TAKING CARE OF THE BIG PICTURE OF ALL THE TAX EXPENDITURES I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT TAX CREDITS TOMORROW IN GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE BUT WHO'S LOOKING AT THE OVERALL STRATEGY OF HOW WE FIT THIS ALL IN. IN TO HAVE A QUANTIFIED IT TO AND HOW IT FIT IN THE WHOLE PICTURE. I AM NOT LOOKING AT THE OVERALL STRATEGY. THE THAT'S I DON'T SEE THAT IS MY PURPOSE HERE AND THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE I THINK THAT APPROPRIATIONS WILL PROBABLY LOOK AT IT -- AS YOU STATED WITH YOUR BILL -- BUT I BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO IS LOOKING OVER AT LOOKING AT THE OVERALL STRATEGY MAYBE THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN HOW DO WE DEAL WITH -- DEALING WITH JUST ONE AREA OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET AND WHAT ABOUT. OTHER AREAS -- JUST CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE SO WHAT I WOULD SAY CENTER MORE LUCK IS MOBILE HOMES ARE THE LAST BASTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN MOBILE HOMES. SO WHAT THIS BILL AND THE PREVIOUS FIVE BILLS THAT I'VE AUTHORED THE BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW REGARDING MOBILE HOMES HAVE TRIED TO DO IS TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE AFFORDABLE FOR FOLKS. THAT THEY STAY AFFORDABLE AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE WAY NOT NECESSARILY ON THE AFFORDABLE PEACE BUT TO MAKE SURE THE MOBILE HOME PARK ISN'T SOLD TO A STRIP MALL INSTANCES TO A DEVELOPER WHO WANTS TO MAKE IT A STRIP MALL. WE NEED THESE MOBILE HOME PARKS THIS BILL GOES ONE STEP FURTHER AND MAKING SURE ORG ARE GIVING US AN OPTION. TO KEEP THEM AS A MOBILE HOME PARK AND NOT SELL THEM TO A DEVELOPER WHO DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH PRIME THAT THEN WE WOULD LOSE MORE LOW INCOME HOUSING. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME. AND I THINK ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO THE MOTION PASSED TO US TO GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE -- BY SENATOR ROTH -- AND CENTER LEYVA IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BOB WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR LEYVA THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SENATOR WINNER AYE.

WE WILL NOW GO TO ITEM NUMBER -- THREE SB THREE TWENTY SIX BY SENATOR HELD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS SB. THREE TWENTY SIX BUILDS UPON LAST YEAR'S SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WHICH ADDRESS BALCONY INSPECTIONS AND REPAIRS FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS FOLLOWING THE DEADLY. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BERKELEY BALCONY COLLAPSE THAT KILLED SIX AND INJURED SEVEN SB THREE TWENTY SIX REQUIRES AN EXISTING CONDOMINIUM BUILDINGS. GOVERNED BY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS RACHEL WAYS AGAIN HAVE INSPECTIONS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY NINE YEARS ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BALCONIES STAIR WELLS. AND OTHER EXTERIOR ELEVATED ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THEY ARE SAFE. SB THREE TWENTY SIX ALSO PREVENTS BUILDERS FROM PLACING THE LANGUAGE IN AN H. ALWAYS COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS OR CC IN OURS. THAT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE H. AWAY BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SUE THE DEVELOPER IF THERE ARE CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS. THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION ONE OF MY WITNESSES WILL DESCRIBE AN H. AWAY DEVELOPMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE A ROUTINE WATER LEAK REVEALED THAT A MAIN WALKWAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE. DUE TO WOULD RIDE THE ROAD BLOCKS THAT IMPEDED THE H. ALWAYS CLAIM AGAINST THE DEVELOPER DAM DEMONSTRATE EXACTLY WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. WHEN THIS BILL PASSAGE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE LAST WEEK I COMMITTED TO SEVERAL AMENDMENTS THAT'LL BE TAKING TODAY TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS DEVELOPERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A SET OFSTRUCTURAL PLANS TO THE H. AWAY? STEEL STRUCTURES ARE ALSO EXEMPT DESPITE THAT THE OPPONENTS ARE STILL TRYING TO AMEND THE BILL. TO FORCE H. AWAY MEMBERS TO VOTE. BEFORE THE ASSOCIATION CAN BRING A LAWSUIT FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT CLAIM. THE EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES EACH -- A BOARD TO GIVE WRITTEN NOTICE TO EACH MEMBER. AND TO HOLD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS WITH CONSTRUCTION AND AVAILABLE OPTIONS PRIOR TO FILING ANY CIVIL ACTION. I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IS A BILL MOVES FORWARD BUT I CANNOT ACCEPT THEIR CURRENT AMENDMENT REQUEST I DO HAVE WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WOULD ASK YOU CHAU NGUYEN IS TO LIMIT. YOUR REMARKS TO THREE MINUTES. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF TODAY'S BILL HI SENATOR HILL MENTIONED HI THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY HAS HAS TWO ELEMENTS TO IT. WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL ELEMENT LAST YEAR IN SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE AS IT DEALT WITH. THE INSPECTIONS A BALCONIES AN ELEVATED WALKWAYS AT COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS A PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE FORMULA USED IN THAT BILL DID NOT REALLY FIT THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IN THE OVERSIGHT. THE CURRENTLY EXISTED COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS WE AGREED AT THAT TIME WHEN THE SENATOR -- PULLED THE LANGUAGE DEALING WITH CONDOMINIUMS THAT WE WOULD COME BACK -- AND TRY TO FIND A FORMULA THAT THAT SUITS THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF FOR COME INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS AND WE BELIEVE WE FOUND THAT IN SB THREE TO SIX IT RECOGNIZES THE FACT THAT EVERY THREE YEARS THERE ARE VISUAL INSPECTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE. OF THE FACILITY FOR PURPOSES OF THE RESERVE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN LAW. THIS WITHIN ADD AN ADDITIONAL INSPECTION. EVERY THIRD CYCLE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THOSE EXTERIOR ELEVATED ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE IN WORKING ORDER AND THAT THERE ARE NO HEALTH OR SAFETY SITUATIONS THAT OCCUR. HI IF IN FACT THERE IS A MATTER OF HEALTH OR SAFETY THAN LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD BE NOTIFIED -- AND THEN THE ASSOCIATION AND THE BOARD WOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REPAIRS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER. TO COMPLY WITH THOSE EALTH AND SAFETY ORDERS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MINIMIZES THE COSTS FOR ASSOCIATIONS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND WORKING WITH AN EXISTING STRUCTURE ALLOWS THEM TO ADEQUATELY PLAN. AND FINANCE OF THOSE REPAIRS AS NEEDED. AFTER THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL IT'S EXISTING LAW -- THAT ASSOCIATION TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK LITIGATION IN CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT TWIN CC AND OURS ARE DEVELOPED AND WRITTEN BY THE DEVELOPERS THAT MOST OF THOSE DOCUMENTS WRITTEN THESE DAYS REQUIRE CERTAIN ELEMENTS INCLUDING A VOTE OF ALL THE MEMBERS. PRIOR TO ALLOWING ASSOCIATION TO SEEK ITS STATUTORY RIGHT FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT ACTION HOW WE BELIEVE THIS IS EXTREMELY UNFAIR AND THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION HAD NO SAY IN THE WRITING OF THOSE DOCUMENTS. AND IT CREATES AN OF STOCK OBSTRUCTION TO A STATUTORY RIGHT THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. SO WE'VE WORKED WITH SENATOR HILL A TO DRAFT THAT SECOND PORTION OF SB -- THREE TWENTY SIX WHICH WOULD MAKE THOSE PROVISIONS NOLAN VOID -- BUT THEN COMPLY WITH ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS -- THAT EXIST WHEN IT COMES TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAW FOR THOSE REASONS A WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB. THREE TWENTY SIX SPENCER RIGID ATTORNEY WHICH CHAPMAN AN ENTRY IN ALAMEDA CALIFORNIA. I REPRESENTED H. WAYS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT BY ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING DEVELOPERS TO SHIELD THEIR CLIENTS FROM LIABILITY. FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS BY DRAFTING OWNERS PROCEDURAL IMPEDIMENTS INTO THE H. WAYS ORIGINAL GOVERNING DOCUMENTS WHICH ACT AS A COMPLETE DEFENSE TO OTHERWISE LEGITIMATE. CLAIMS. ALMOST A METICULOUSLY SATISFIED. THIS IS TYPICALLY DONE BY REQUIRING A MEMBERSHIP VOTE TO PURSUE A CLAIM OR EVEN HIRE AN EXPERT TO INVESTIGATE OR AN ATTORNEY TO ADVISE THEM. DEVELOPER PROVISIONS IN CCAR'S FOR QUITE MEMBER APPROVAL TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST THEM. OUR PURPOSE WE DESIGNED TO AVOID LIABILITY FOR FAULTY WORKMANSHIP AND SHIFT THE BURDEN AND EXPENSE OF REPAIRS TO THE HOMEOWNERS. THIS CAN BE DEVASTATING. WE ARE CURRENTLY HANDLING A CLAIM IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR DEVELOPMENT SOLD AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THE EXTERIOR ELEVATED WALKWAYS OF THE PROJECT SUFFER SERIOUS ROT AND DECAY. DUE TO FAULTY CONSTRUCTION PRESENTING A LIFE SAFETY RISK. IF THE OWNERS ARE FORCED TO PAY FOR REPAIRS. THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT MANY OF THEM COULD LOSE THEIR ARMS. NO ONE SHOULD EVER LOSE THEIR HOME ON A TECHNICALITY DUE TO THE FAILURE TO METICULOUSLY COMPLY. WITH DEVELOPER DRAFTED PRECONDITIONS IN THE H. WAYS GOVERNING DOCUMENTS. BOARD MEMBERS ARE ELECTED BY THE HOMEOWNERS AND HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE H. AWAY. THE BOARD IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE WELL INFORMED pDECISIONS AFTER CONSULTATION WITH EXPERTS AND COUNSEL ON WHETHER TO PURSUE A CLAIM. IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS BOARD MEMBERS CONSULT WITH ATTORNEYS IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. AND POSSESS ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED INFORMATION AND WORK PRODUCT WHICH CANNOT BE DISSEMINATED TO THE MEMBERSHIP WITHOUT RISKING WAIVER OF THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. EIGHT TO A MEMBERSHIP VOTE CAN TAKE FOUR TO SIX MONTHS TO ACCOMPLISH. MEMBERSHIP VOTER APATHY IS AN UNFORTUNATE REALITY WITH A TWO WAYS WHICH CAN MAKE OBTAINING A QUORUM FOR A VALID THE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. DEVELOPERS OFTEN ACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT THESE VOTES. AS A RESULT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CAN EXPIRE BEFORE THE VOTERS ACCOMPLISHED. THE OPPOSITION CONTENDS THESE MEMBERSHIP VOTE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THE FOR THE PROTECTION AND BENEFIT OF THE HOMEOWNERS. HOWEVER I ASSURE YOU. NOTHING IS FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. THE FACT IS THESE PROVISIONS ARE AGGRESSIVELY USED IN LITIGATION AS PROCEDURAL DEFENSES TO DEFEAT THE HOMEOWNERS CLAIMS. THIS TACTIC WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE RECENT BRANCHES NEIGHBORHOOD CASE. THE MEMBERSHIP DID VOTE ENDED OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVE OF THE LITIGATION. BUT NOT BEFORE IT HAD ALREADY BEEN INITIATED. SO THEY LOST THE CLAIM ON A TECHNICALITY. CIVIL CODE SIXTY ONE FIFTY ALREADY REQUIRES THE BOARD TO HOLD A MEETING TO EXPLAIN THE PROCESS AND CLAIMS TO THE MEMBERSHIP BEFORE SUIT IS FILED. THUS GIVING THE MEMBERS A VOICE IN THE DECISION. WE'VE CONDUCTED THESE MEETINGS AND THEY ARE NOT A MERE FORMALITY. RATHER THEY ARE OFTEN THREE TO FOUR HOURS LONG INCLUDING PRESENTATIONS BY CONSTRUCTION CONSULTANTS IN QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSIONS WITH THE MEMBERSHIP. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU [inaudible] THE BILL. PACING NONE -- WILL MAKE THE OPPOSITION UP. SEE THE SAME [inaudible] X. BUT WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NAY CAMERA. WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL THAT -- DUE TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ACCEPTED IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- WE WILL BE -- TAKING THE STATUS ARE INTERNAL STATUS OF THIS BILL FROM HOUSING KILLER TO JUST OPPOSE. HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH WE STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. AND I WANT TO MAKE THOSE A LITTLE BIT CLEARER FOR YOU TODAY -- I RECOGNIZE YOUR A YOUR REACTION TO THAT -- ALL RIGHT SECTION THREE OF HE BILL -- WHICH I THINK WAS PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO A SECTION TO THE BILL. IS DEALING WITH THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS FOR HOMEOWNERS-ASSOCIATION. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THAT. WE CAN'T BUILD MULTI FAMILY ATTACHED HOUSING IN THE STATE WITHOUT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS. THAT IS AN ADD THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT CAN OPERATE WITHOUT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS BECAUSE THOSE COMMON WALLS BETWEEN UNITS. ARE COMMON AREAS THAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS -- I WILL ADD FURTHER THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE LIKE ABOUT THE BILL -- WE DON'T. WE LIKE THE PART THAT EXCLUDES US FROM PARTICIPATING. IN THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON LITIGATION NOT ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT EXTENDS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THOSE CLAIMS SO WE DON'T WE WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS ISN'T ABOUT. THAT PART OF THE BILL. THE PART OF THE BILL THAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH IS THAT THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS. THE HOMEOWNERS FROM VOTING ON ON THOSE. ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE BOARD TO FILE LAWSUITS. AND FOR BEING INFORMED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND FIRST OF ALL WHY THOSE PROVISIONS ARE PUT INTO THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE RECEIVED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE ALSO RECEIVE COMPLAINTS FROM EXISTING HOMEOWNERS WHO AFTER THE LITIGATION WAS FILED WERE SURPRISED TO FIND. THAT THEIR DUES ARE ASSESSMENTS WERE INCREASED THAT THEY HAD TO MAKE THEIR UNITS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION SOMETIMES DESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF THOSE UNITS. THAT THE OR CALL THE THERE IS WITNESSES ARE TO PARTICIPATE IN DEPOSITIONS. WITH THEIR ABILITY TO SELL OR REFINANCE THEIR HOMES AFTER THE LITIGATION WAS FILED -- IS IMPAIRED AND THAT THEY HAD DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS TO FUTURE BUYERS. AND THAT'S WHY THE D. R. E. WHICH IS THE CONSUMER PROTECTOR AND ALL OF THIS WITH THAT APPROVES OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS. HAS APPROVED THOSE DOCUMENTS WITH THOSE PROVISIONS IN THEM. THE WAY THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IT WOULD EXCLUDE NOT JUST THE RIGHT TO VOTE. BUT ALSO THE RIGHT TO BE INFORMED OF THOSE CONSEQUENCES. THE REFERENCES THAT ARE MADE TO CIVIL CODE SECTION SIXTY ONE FIFTY DON'T ADDRESS THAT. THE MEETING THAT'S HELD AND AND THE DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENS SOLELY BETWEEN THE BOARD AND ITS COUNCIL. IS DESIGNED TO EXPRESS THE NEED FOR THE LITIGATION THE PROBLEMS. AND IT'S ALL. DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT STEERS THE BOARD. AND IF THERE ARE MEMBERS THAT ARE ABLE TO BE THERE -- IS TEARS THEM TOWARDS FILING LITIGATION. THERE'S THIS IS A PROCESS THAT DOES NOT NEED TO HAPPEN BEFORE A LITIGATION IS FILED IT CAN HAPPEN AFTER THAT. AND IN IN THOSE REGARDS IT'S REALLY NOT AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE. THE DECISION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO FILE. A LAWSUIT. I'M IT'S CLEAR TO US AT LEAST THAT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE BOARD CAN'T MAKE MONEY OFF OF REPAIRS. THEY CAN ONLY MAKE MONEY IF LITIGATION IS FILED. EXISTING LAW SB EIGHT HUNDRED HAS A PRE LITIGATION PROCESS IN IT. IT BEGINS WITH THE BOARD SENDING A NOTICE TO THE BUILDER. AND IT HAS INSPECTIONS IT HAS A REPAIR PROCESS AND HAS MEDIATION AND EVEN AT THAT POINT. IF THE BOARD ISN'T SATISFIED WITH THE REPAIRS. THEY CAN GO TO COURT FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE BUILDER. THAT'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. IN THE BRANCHES CASE THE ONE THAT WAS CITED. THAT PROCESS ACTUALLY TOOK THIRTEEN MONTHS. SO THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. FOR MEMBERS HOMEOWNERS WITHIN THE ASSOCIATION TO BE INFORMED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF LITIGATION AND EVEN TO VOTE. I WOULD SAY THAT. IF YOU EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T WANT THEM TO VOTE. THEY SHOULD STILL BE IN FORT. THE COURTS HAVE REALLY ADDRESS THIS IN A NUMBER OF CASES AND ALWAYS UP HELD THE PUBLIC POLICY. OF ALLOWING HOMEOWNERS TO BE INFORMED AND TO VOTE BEFORE LITIGATION. I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO MAKE A DISTINCTION HERE. WITH IT IT'S FAIR TO SAY. THAT PUTTING UP. SOME PROCESS SOME PRECONDITION BEFORE FILING A CLAIM INITIATING THE SB EIGHT HUNDRED PROCESS. IS UNFAIR. BUT THERE'S ENOUGH TIME BETWEEN THE TIME OF FILING A CLAIM AS I MENTIONED. AND A YEAR LATER WHEN YOU FILE A LAWSUIT. THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME DURING THAT PERIOD TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. THAT DOESN'T BECOME AN IMPAIRMENT. TO FILING. A LAWSUIT THE COURTS HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DAVIS STIRLING EXACT AIM TO BALANCE THE NEED TO OPERATE EFFICIENCY EFFICIENTLY WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE MEMBERS TO BE INFORMED AND PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS THAT WOULD IMPACT THE ASSOCIATION FOR YEARS. IF NOT DECADES TO COME. WE CANNOT IGNORE SUCH A PROVISION IN THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS. BECAUSE IT IS INCONVENIENT FOR THE ASSOCIATION IN A PARTICULAR CASE. THE ASSOCIATION HAD THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS IT WAS ON NOTICE OF THEIR CONTENTS PUBLIC POLICY REQUIRES US TO FOLLOW THE PLAIN LANGUAGE. THE VOTE REQUIREMENT IMPLEMENTS THE PROTECTIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE VALUE OF NOT ONLY. THEIR INDIVIDUAL UNITS. BUT ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT AS A WHOLE. IN ANTICIPATES THAT INVESTIGATION OF COMMON AREA DEFECTS COULD REQUIRE. INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS TO PERMIT ACCESS AND TESTING THAT AFFECT THEIR UNITS. SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AT LEAST. TO PRESERVE A DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. TO THE HOMEOWNERS NOT TO THE BUILDER. NOT INVOLVING THE BUILDER. BUT TO THE HOMEOWNER SO THAT THEY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACTION THE BOARDS TAKING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS AND IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO LIVE IN A TO THREE MINUTES OF THE GREAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TOM SIR I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW. WE DID SOME WORK LAST YEAR IN PREPARATION -- FOR ADDRESSING SENATE BILL SEVEN TWENTY ONE AND THEN OF COURSE WHEN THE C. ID'S WERE PULLED OUT OF THE BUILDING WE STOPPED WORKING. AND NOW WE'RE BACK HERE WITH WHAT WE HAD UNDERSTOOD WAS GOING TO BE RULES FOR C. ID'S. I WANT TO MAKE SOME. THREE SEVERAL POINTS HERE ABOUT ARE CONCERNED NUMBER ONE IS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL SEE ID'S IT INCLUDES ONLY CONDOMINIUMS. AND THAT LEAVES OUT SOME SIGNIFICANT CATEGORIES OF C. ID'S TOTALLY UNPROTECTED THESE WOULD INCLUDE. A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS IN COOPS. AND WE THINK THOSE SHOULD BE INCLUDED ALL SEE ID SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS COVERAGE. SECONDLY IT EXTENDS THE SIX YEAR INSPECTION FRAMEWORK IN SEVEN TWENTY ONE IT EXTENDED OUT TEN NINE YEARS. AND THAT SEEMS TO US TO BE AN UNWARRANTED. ADDITIONAL RISK TO OF RESIDENTS OF C. ID'S. A WINNER STAND THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT. THE BERKELEY BALCONY COLLAPSE OCCURRED LESS THAN NINE YEARS. FROM THE TIME THAT THE BUILDING WAS COMPLETED IN FIRST OCCUPY. SO THE NINE YEAR INSPECTION REGIME WOULD NOT OF CAUGHT THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION IT'S JUST NINE YEARS IS TOO LONG EXCUSE ME. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT THE INSPECTIONS THAT ARE MANDATED IN THIS BILL. ARE CAN BE VISUAL INSPECTIONS ONLY. NOW LAST YEAR WE DID CONSULT WITH EXPERTS IN THE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THE DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFYING CALLED RISKS. OF COLLAPSE RATHER CATASTROPHE. FROM INSPECTIONS A LOW. SO THAT THESE INSPECTION SHOULD BE MUCH MORE RIGOROUS AND PREFERABLY. AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS LOW TESTING MIGHT BE CONSIDERED -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS BUT WE'RE AT THIS POINT WE'RE OPPOSED THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. OKAY SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CALLERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR ROTH. I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS IF IF THERE'S A LIMITATION IN THE C. C. IN OURS CAN'T THE HOMEOWNERS VOTE TO PULL IT OUT OF THE SEA SOONERS. AND I THINK THIS GENERAL -- I DON'T CARE -- IN THIS CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION THE PROBLEM THAT WE FIND IS IT IN THE SHE SHE IN OURS THAT ORIGINALLY DRAFTED IT DOESN'T. IT PRECLUDES ANY CHANGES TO THE CC IN OUR THAT WOULD AFFECT THE DEVELOPER AND THEY PLAY INCLUDE THAT IN THE SEATS YOU KNOW IMPRESSION CLARIFICATION IF WE DO SEE THAT -- IN THE C. C. NOT AS A DEVELOPER ALREADY SORT OF IN BEDS -- PROVISION IN THERE THAT PREVENTS HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS FROM AMENDING THOSE TYPES PROVISIONS THE BENEFIT TO DEVELOPERS WITHOUT CONSENT FROM THE DEVELOPER WHICH OF COURSE THEY WOULD NEVER GIVE AS I'VE BEEN CHALLENGED. THE COURTS APPEL THE I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S GONE THROUGH THE COURTS I WOULD FIND THAT. AMAZING THAT THE COURT WOULD OF UP. A POLL THAT SORT OF PROVISION. WHAT ARE THE KEY WELL WHAT'S THE VOTE REQUIREMENT WHEN YOU HAVE A VOTED VERY SAID SOMETIMES IT'S A MAJORITY OF SOMETIMES AS I'VE HEARD IS 80% TO THEY CAN INCLUDE WHATEVER THEY WANT AND IN THE SHE SEEN OUR SINCE THEY WRITE THIS ISSUE IN OURS? AND THEN -- BOOK. THE OPPOSITION SPOKE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF LITIGATION I'M NOT. TOTALLY FAMILIAR WITH CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION IS IT TYPICALLY. CONDUCTED ON A CONTINGENT FEE BASIS. TYPICALLY IT IS -- MOSTLY CLAIMS THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE TO PURSUE IN ALMOST ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT SET UP TO HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO HIRE LEGAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS IN ORDER THEY EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY -- TO OFTENTIMES HIGHER THE FOR ITS A CONSULTANTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS IN SUPPORT OF LITIGATION. AND SO -- THE TERM THE LAW FIRMS THAT ARE FROM OFTEN WILL TAKEN ON A CONTINGENCY FEE BASIS AND ALSO ADVANCE THE COSTS OF THE LITIGATION AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW THE RISK IS REALLY BORN MORE BY THE ATTORNEYS IN TERMS OF PURSUING THE CLAIM VERSUS THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS. THE ONE THAT GOES THROUGH HER TO MY QUESTION I UNDERSTAND INSPECTIONS AND DURING CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION BUT OTHER THAN. OTHER THAN -- OPENING UP. THE DWELLING FOR AN INSPECTION FOR EXAMPLE WHAT OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF AND I GUESS THIS IS MORE DRESS THE OPPOSITION WHETHER CONSEQUENCES WOULD THERE BE -- TO THIS CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION. IN A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THERE QUITE A FEW ONE IS THAT -- WE DID HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A CASE WHERE -- NINETEEN HOMEOWNERS GOT ASSESSED AND LEAN FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH. THAT THEIR DUES -- ASSESSMENTS CAN GO UP -- BUT WHY. BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THE BOARD LOST THE CASE AND THEY GOT THE FENCED IN THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT -- THAT GOT IMPOSED ON THE HOW THE HOMEOWNERS AND EXPERT FEES YEAH AND I I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF THAT BUT THAT WORKED OUT. BUT A BOLD STATEMENT WHEN YOU SEE THE CONSEQUENCES AND I'M JUST TRYING TO DRILL DOWN. THE ROAD EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE WHEN IT'S CONTINGENT LITIGATION YEAH I UNDERSTAND EXPERT COSTS BEING ASSESSED TO THE LOSER IN SOME CASES I DON'T KNOW CONSTRUCTION DEFECT IS THAT REQUIRED TO DESERVE HAVE TO BE A THE SETTLEMENT -- FOR THAT STERN DOWN IN ORDER TO RECOVER -- WILL THERE ARE NONE THE NINE NINE EIGHT OFFERS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS THINKING OF I'M TRYING TO PROBE WHAT YEAH IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE BY SETTLEMENT IT CAN BE ALLEN USUALLY IS NOT BY SETTLEMENT AT WHERE YOU HAVE A DEFENSE VERDICT SO YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE TRIAL. AND AT AT AND THERE'S A VERDICT AND THE BOARD IN THAT CASE LOST. THE CASE -- I AND I AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE DETAILS OF THAT PARTICULAR CASES. TO WHAT THOSE COSTS WERE -- WHETHER THEY'RE EXPERT COSTS BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT AFFECT IN THAT WE CAME AS A SURPRISE TO HOMEOWNERS. WHEN THEY WANT TO SELL OR REFINANCE THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY FOUND THAT? REFINANCING WAS MADE DIFFICULT THEY COULDN'T DO A CONFORMING LOAN BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES WOULD NOT. ENSURE THE LOAN BECAUSE THERE WAS LITIGATION PENDING AND THAT WHEN THEY WANT TO SELL THEIR HOMES. THEY FOUND THAT PEOPLE SURPRISINGLY DON'T WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO BUY A HOME DON'T WANT TO BITE INTO LIIGATION. SO THE THE PRICES THAT THEY COULD SELL THEIR HOME FOR IS DEPRESSED. AND THEN FINALLY THEY ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO DISCLOSE THE CLAIM -- IT TO FUTURE POTENTIAL BUYERS. AND THAT TRIGGERS SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL ISSUES AS TO HOW WAS IT RESOLVED WAS THE PROBLEM FIXED WAS IT SOMEBODY RECEIVE A CASH PAYMENT. AND TODAY FIX THE PROBLEM WITH THAT -- THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE -- THE COULD THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT IN THE PROBLEM ANYWAY IN THE SALES DOCUMENTS ORANGE YOU ARE BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THAT AND THEN THEY WISHED THEY WISH FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO DISCLOSE IT RIGHT AND THEY'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT AT THE TIME THAT THE CLAIM. ARISES BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE THROUGH WHETHER THIS PLANNED OR WHETHER IT'S STILL BEING TRANSFERRED FOR JOB. THE THEY NEED TO SELL THEIR HOME AND THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD DISCLOSE THAT -- AND THAT HAS -- IT HAS AN IMPACT ON THEM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT LAST COMMENT THE BROKER WOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO DO WITH THAT BUT I I WON'T BELABOR THIS MISTER THANK YOU SIR. COULD I HAVE A MY WITNESS RESPOND YES. BUT ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THE OPPOSITION MAKES IS THAT THE HOMEOWNERS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT -- AS A RESULT OF THE LITIGATION AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS -- IN TERMS OF UNIT SALES AND A REFINANCING DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE CLAN -- THAT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS -- SOME IMPACT WHILE THE CLAIM IS PENDING IN DEPENDING ON HOW LONG THAT PROCESS IS DROWNED OUT BY THE DEFENSE IN THE DEVELOPER -- IT COULD BE FROM YOU KNOW TWELVE MONTHS TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS WHILE THE CLAIM IS PENDING HOWEVER. IN MY EXPERIENCE THE VAST MAJORITIES CLAIMS RESOLVE BY A SETTLEMENT. AND ALMOST ASSOCIATIONS ARE IN A FAR BETTER POSITION AFTER THE CLAIM IS RESOLVED BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO REPAIR CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS IN DANGEROUS CONDITIONS OF THE PROPERTY -- IN ORDER TO KEEP THE DUES DOWN AND PREVENT SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. UP THE THE ARGUMENT THAT IT IMPACTS. SALES DURING THE THE PERIOD IS OF LITIGATION IS IN FACT -- AN ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF LIFE HOMEOWNERS -- SHOULD NOT BE MAKING THE DECISION TO PURSUE A CLAIM AND BOARD SHOULD BECAUSE THE HOMEOWNERS DON'T HAVE A FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION TO THE REST OF THE MEMBERSHIP -- AS A WHOLE AS DO THE BOARD MEMBERS THE BOARD HAVE TO HAS TO LOOK OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE ASSOCIATION -- IF A HOMEOWNER HAS A CONCERNED THAT OF LITIGATION COULD AFFECT THE OUR MEDIA NEED TO SELL THEIR PROPERTY IF YOU HAVE A HOMEOWNER. HE WANTS TO SELL THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS CLOUD OF LITIGATION OVER IT THAT MIGHT IMPACT THEIR OWN PERSONAL -- DESIRE TO SELL THEIR UNIT THAT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT THEY HAVE IT'S NOT IN THE BENEFIT OF THE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOR THE LONG TERM. AND WOULD BE SADDLED WITH THE EXPENSE OF HAVING TO PAY FOR A DEFECT REPAIRS IF THE CLAIM WAS PURSUED IN SELF FOR THAT REASON -- HOMEOWNERS WHO DO NOT HAVE TO SHARE OBLIGATION TO ONE ANOTHER SHOULD NOT BE MAKING THE DECISION TO PURSUE A CLAIM RATHER IT SHOULD BE THE BOARD WHO HAS A FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION -- TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL MEMBERS. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR MORE LOOK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION STATES THAT. THIS BILL -- THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IT HAS ADDED COSTS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS COULD YOU QUANTIFY THOSE COSTS WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK THAT WAS OUR POSITION BASED ON THE BASED ON THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT'S WAS SECTION. ONE THAT HAD THE PLANS AND THE SPECS. THAT. HAS BEEN DELETED FROM THE BILL. I MEAN I'M HAPPY GOING TO THAT BUT IF IT'S NOT IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL. AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO IT. I WOULD MEAN. IF IT'S NOT IN THE CURRENT VERSION UNLESS ARE MORE LIKE WOULD LIKE TO GO INTO IT. YOU KNOW I'LL DO A LITTLE MORE DIGGING HERE. JUST. PERHAPS MAY I DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING SO THANK YOU SELECT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS A THINNER CABALLERO. I JUST HAVE A QUESTION -- WHEN I WALKED IN AND I SAT DOWN AND YOU WERE SPEAKING SENATOR I MISSED? I I HEARD YOU SAYING YOU ARE NOT TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND I ARE TAKING THEM OKAY GREAT I I'M MISUNDERSTOOD IS I THINK JUDICIARY WHERE YOU YES WHERE I SAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHECK THAT CLEARS IT UP FOR ME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE BILL SENATOR WINNER. YES CENTER BATES. YES I I AM CONCERNED. WITH THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND FOCUS. THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ISSUE OUT WHEN THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP. DOESN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT FINAL DECISION THE REASON BEING I'VE BEEN. A MEMBER OF AN H. AWAY WHERE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF FILE. LITIGIOUS SITUATIONS IN WHICH ONE WENT ARE NOT IN OUR FAVOR AND WE DID HAVE AN EXTRA SAUCE MEANT. NOT AS LARGE AS SOME THAT ARE DISCUSSED HERE. SO I'M CONCERNED AS TO WHY WE WOULD BE SO WORRIED ABOUT. THEM VOTING OR NOT BUILDING WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON THE BOARD POTENTIALLY IMPACTED BY THIS SAME THING. IN THERE ARE NOT PREVENTED FROM WHAT I KNOW OF THE WAY IT'S OPERATED IN MY COMMUNITY. THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED TO OPT OUT. OF A DECISION WHEN IT AFFECTS THEM ALSO. BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT ENGAGE THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP WHEN IT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE ENTIRE TEAM INCLUDING ME ON THE CORD. I HAVE SOME SORT OF PROTECTION THAT I AM NOT IN CONFLICT BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS TO BE MY HOME AND I WON'T GO INTO A COUPLE IN OUR CITIES. IN OUR FUTURE WAY THAT THIS DID A FACTOR -- BEYOND THE ODD THOSE OTHERS ARE DRAWN INTO MAYBE THE ARGUMENT THAT TWO OR THREE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT LET'S SAY THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT STYLE HOME IN A YOU KNOW MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITY. THEIR PLAN THREE AND FOUR WHICH HAS THE DEFECTS IN THE OTHER GUYS DON'T BUT THEY WANT THE THE HOLD ASSOCIATION TO BE IN THEIR CAMP. SO THEY'LL VOTE FOR AND I THINK THOSE ARE CONCERNS THAT BY NOT INVOLVING THE WHOLE MEMBERSHIP -- IF NOT A VOTE SOME THING THAT'S VERY OPEN AND DIRECT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON SO THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL. FLORA IS REALLY -- TO ME LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ON THE PART OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THOSE WHO WERE INVOLVED AT THIS YOU GUYS KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS. PROBLEMS WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SOMEBODY GOT ON BECAUSE THEY WANTED A BASKETBALL YOU KNOW. WHO FUND THEIR FRIEND ON THEIR GARAGE FOR THEIR KID NOBODY ELSE WANTED IT SO THEY HAVE SOMETHING THAT ALLOW THAT? THIS HAPPENS QUITE A BIT AND I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT. I THINK MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES OF SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY. THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN THE LATE EIGHTIES NINETIES OUR H. AWAY -- THERE'S VERY FEW THAT ARE VOLUNTARY SO YOU ARE REALLY AT THE MERCY OF THE PEOPLE THEY GET ELECTED TO THOSE BOARDS AND SOMETIMES. THEY'RE TIRED THEY DON'T THAT HAPPEN IN MY ASSOCIATION THEY WILL TOTAL TURNOVER BECAUSE TO THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT. SO I DO BELIEVE THE THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP NEEDS HELP SOME SIGNIFICANT -- PARTY IN THE DECISION MAKING HERE AND HOW YOU MIGHT. SENATOR HILL YES THINKS IT NEEDS MORE WORK IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH. AN ACTUAL VOTE AND ONLY YOU KNOW ON THAT THAT STUFF IN ISSUE TOO BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER BALANCE FOR YOUR JUST BASICALLY PUTTING A BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND AN INCREDIBLY -- FINANCIALLY -- RELEVANT POSITION WITH REGARDS TO THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THOUGH THE FIFTY HOMES A TWO HUNDRED HOMES -- AND MAYBE ONLY A THIRD OF THEM HAVE THIS PARTICULAR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT -- I'M OF AN ARCHITECT FAMILY AND KIND OF KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE DEVELOPER AND THE ARCHITECT IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF YOU KNOW THERE THERE ONE WEEK FROM THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND BEING GO THE WHOLE ASSOCIATION GETS. OF A LETTER FROM YOU KNOW AND AN ATTORNEY OF SOME SORT SO I JUST LIKE TO ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT -- BECAUSE I THINK THE YOU'VE DIALED THE BALLOT THEY NEED TO BE DIALED IN A STRONGER POSITION MEMBERS OF AN ASSOCIATION. AND FOR THAT REASON I WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY IN OUR SUPPORT IS YOUR OTHER ONES SUBSEQUENT TO THE THE BERKELEY INCIDENT. BUT THIS ONE I THINK IS REALLY A REALLY -- REACHING TOO FAR IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU GIVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS I IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WILL AFFECT AN INDIVIDUAL AND BASICALLY THEIR LARGEST I INVESTMENT -- FINANCIALLY THAT THEY HAVE THEIR HOME. AND THAT FLOW SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU HAVE A CLOUD PUT OVER THAT BECAUSE OF LAWSUITS THAT COULD GO ON DRAG ON AND ON ALL OF THEM SO. THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AND THE REAL HAVING BEEN A MIDDLE OF A FEW OF THEM I PERSONALLY. AND IF I COULD RESPOND JUST A LITTLE BIT I DO FEEL AND MY WITNESS WANTED TO TO MAKE A COMMENT TO WEEK WE DO LIVE IN THESE H.. ARE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACIES -- AND THEY MAKE DECISIONS THAT CAN -- LEAN PROPERTY ALL THE TIME --IN DIFFERENT CASES THEY HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE DECISIONS. THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE RELATED TO LITIGATION ARE BASED ON OF A MEETING WHERE THE INFORMATION IS BROUGHT TO THE HOMEOWNERS SO THERE IS A PUBLIC COMPENSATION AROUND THIS. AND AND AGAIN THE THE FACT THAT THEY THEY THEY MAKE DECISIONS AND TAKE ACTION ON PROPERTY DECISIONS ON LAWSUIT LOGICAL LITIGATION -- ALL THE TIME AND DO NOT INVOLVE THE FULL MEMBERSHIP IN IN THAT IT'S DONE IS IN A WAY -- TO REPRESENT THE AT THE GROUP AS A WHOLE AND I THINK -- MISTER BROWN HAD A COMMENT. CHAIR RIVER. THANK YOU I DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST TO CLARIFY THAT. THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT VOTES FROM BEING IN AMENDED INTO THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS WHAT A PROHIBITS IS THE DECLARANT OR THE DEVELOPER FROM WRITING THOSE INTO THE DOCUMENTS. PRIOR TO THE ASSOCIATION EVER BE INFORMED THE ASSOCIATION STILL HAS THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE LANGUAGE WITH IN SB THREE TWENTY SIX TO ADD THOSE REQUIREMENTS. WITH A VOTE OF THE MEMBERS -- IF THAT ASSOCIATION SO CHOOSES SO THE IDEA IS TO IS REALLY TO LEAVE THESE DECISIONS ON WHETHER NOT A VOTE IS REQUIRED FOR THESE TYPES OF ACTIONS. TO THE MEMBERSHIP RATHER THAN THE WAY IT IS IN PRACTICE NOW WHICH IS WRITTEN BY THE DEVELOPER. IN A DOCUMENT IT GENERALLY HAS OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS WITHIN IT PREVENTING THOSE CHANGES TO TO HAPPEN. OKAY -- CENTER OFF ANOTHER QUESTION. THE COUPLE FOLLOW UP MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT TYPE SITUATIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THOSE DEFECTS WOULD MPOSE LIABILITY ON THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION AS AN ASSOCIATION -- WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF INSIDE OUTSIDE ISSUES THAT THE ASSOCIATION WOULD NORMALLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. DID THAT QUESTION MAKE SENSE I'M SORRY COULD YOU CLARIFY THAT TIME A CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS ASSUME THAT THE DEFECTS THEMSELVES WITH THOSE BE THE TYPE OF DEFECTS AND ISSUES THAT MIGHT IMPOSE LIABILITY ON THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION IF. IF ON CORRECTED. ABSOLUTELY AND THAT THE CASE THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH ELEVATED WALKWAYS THAT ARE THE ONLY MEANS OF INGRESS AND EGRESS TO THE UNITS ON THE ON THE FIFTH LEVEL -- IF IF LEFT ON REMEDIATED THOSE ARE IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE IN THEIR LIFE SAFETY RISK IN SELF SOMEONE WERE. TO YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY BE THERE AT THE WRONG TIME AND BE SERIOUSLY INJURED -- OR WORSE -- THAN ABSOLUTELY THE ASSOCIATION COULD FACE LIABILITY -- FOR FAILURE TO TAKE ACTION. AND THEN FINALLY I DON'T REMEMBER MY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. LOWER DAVIS STERLING BUT IS THERE A REQUIREMENT BEFORE A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION -- RETAINS AN ATTORNEY AND INITIATE LITIGATION THAT THE MATTER BE. AGENDA AT A SCHEDULED TO HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION BOARD MEETING AND A VOTE OF THE BOARD TAKEN. BUT TYPICALLY THAT'S DONE ANY IN EXECUTIVE SESSION THAT THAT DECISION TO RETAIN COUNSEL -- THE BOARD MEMBERS -- MAKE THAT DECISION. IT WOULD NOT BE AGENDA TO ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION ABOUT.

THREE TWENTY THREE CONTINUING WITH H. AWAY WEEK -- FIRST OFF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COMMITTEES MOCK UP OF THESE AMENDMENTS REFLECT MY GOOD FAITH EFFORT. TO STREAMLINE THE BILL AND COMPROMISE WITH THE OPPOSITION -- THE BILL BEFORE U. S. P. -- THREE TWO THREE WILL STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE OF CALIFORNIA'S. FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY SOME. H. AWAY BOARDS HAVE MANIPULATED ELECTIONS BY FAILING TO NOTICE THE ELECTION. SOME BOARDS BY FAILING TO DELIVER BALLOTS TO ALL THE RESIDENTS IN SOME BOARDS HAVE FAILED -- BY THROWING OUT VALID BALLOT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN HOLD ELECTIONS AT ALL -- THESE CORRUPT BOARDS WILL EXCLUDING DISENFRANCHISES OTHER HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO SEEK TO CHALLENGE THEIR EXISTING REGIME. HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION BOARDS CAN FIND HOMEOWNERS CAN TAKE THEM TO COURT EVEN FOR CLOSE ON THEIR HOMES SAID SO THESE -- BOARD MEMBERS SELECTIONS ARE NO SMALL MATTER. HERE TODAY WITH ME IS SHELLY -- DISTEFANO. WHO'S AN H. AWAY RESIDENT AND FORMER BOARD MEMBER IN JUDGE TOM SIR IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE NITROGEN AYE VOTE. I THANK YOU AND I FIVE SEVEN SQ TWIN IS TO LIMIT THE TESTIMONY TO THREE MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TOM SIR AND I WILL MORE FULLY INTRODUCE MYSELF. I'M A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW. I AM A RETIRED SUPERIOR COURT COMMISSIONER OUT OF THAT'LL ALAMEDA COUNTY AND AMONG OTHER THINGS SET FOR MANY YEARS AND SMALL CLAIMS CASES AND I CONTINUE TO DO THAT AFTER RETIREMENT -- AND FOR FIVE YEARS I WAS THE CHAIR OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SUBCOMMITTEE ON SMALL CLAIMS AND LIMITED JURISDICTION CASES. SO I DO BRING A SOMEWHAT OF A JUDICIAL PERSPECTIVE TO THIS DISCUSSION -- I'D LIKE TO FIRST BEGIN BY NOTING -- A FACT WHICH MANY YOU ARE AWARE OF ALREADY WHICH IS. THAT ABOUT 25% OF CALIFORNIANS DO LIVE IN H. AWAY GOVERN COMMUNITIES AND THIS NUMBER IS GROWING DAILY. AZIZ FISCAL ADVANTAGES OF HAVING A TWO WAYS -- ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY MANY CITIES. AND OF COURSE. IN AN H. AWAY THE HE CHOI ITSELF EXERTS A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF CONTROL OVER THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH LIVING. THE PERSONS WHO LISTEN WHAT ARE THESE -- TYPES OF DEVELOPMENTS HAS ONLY. ELECTIONS THAT -- I'D LIKE TO ALSO NOTES AND BACKGROUND WHICH IS THAT THE CURRENT LAW GOVERNING ELECTIONS. IS THE PRODUCT OF A THREE YEAR BI PARTISAN EFFORT. LED BY SENATORS DAVE JONES AND JIM BATON. THAT RESULTED IN A CONSENSUS SERIES OF CONSENSUS BILLS. THAT THE PRESIDENT OF OUR CENTER MARJORIE MURRAY WHO'S IN ANOTHER HEARING AT THIS POINT. A CAN OF PARTICIPATED IN THAT THREE YEAR VERY GRUELING. EFFORT THAT RESULTED IN THE CURRENT ELECTION STRUCTURED IN DAVIS STERLING. OUR CENTER HAS CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES. AND A AND THIS IS. PRIMARILY THROUGH FEEDBACK FROM. RESIDENTS OF A CHOICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE GET INFORMATION WE GET COMPLAINTS -- WE YET THE CONCERNS OF ALL TYPES. I EXPRESSED AND FRUSTRATIONS AND THE BILL BEFORE YOU IS LARGELY BASED ON THAT KIND OF FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD PROBLEMS WITH THE EXISTING. ELECTORAL STRUCTURE -- SO THAT -- AS THE CENTERED POINTED OUT. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF BAD THINGS GOING ON IN IN ELECTIONS. AND IN THE ABILITY OF AN INCUMBENT BOARD TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AND POWER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. TO MANIPULATION OF EITHER THE THE CONDUCT OF THE ELECTION OR THE RULES GOVERNING THE ELECTION. SO THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BILL ARE. THAT WE ADDRESS QUALIFICATIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IMPOSED ON RUNNING FOR THE BOARD. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT A PUBLIC COLLECTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THERE'S ONLY ONE RESTRICTION THAT I'M AWARE OF IN. OF RUNNING FOR ANY PUBLIC OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS IF YOU HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY INVOLVING BASICALLY BREACH OF PUBLIC TRUST SERIES OF CLOSELY DEFINED -- TYPES OF FELONIES. THAT'S THE ONLY RESTRICTION. YOU CAN BE OWING BACK TAXES YOU COULD BE DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND YOU'RE STILL QUALIFIED TO RUN. SO QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE BOARD ARE NOW UNDER THIS BILL RESTRICTED. SO THAT YOU CAN'T BE MANIPULATED AND OF DISSENTERS. RENDERED UNABLE TO RUN FOR THE BOARD [inaudible] ANOTHER. POINT IN THE BILL IS TO GUARANTEE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTION. IN PUBLIC ELECTIONS WE HAVE THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE REGISTER VOTERS CITY CLERKS AND SO FORTH THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A VERY INDEPENDENT STRUCTURE THAT IS NOT GOVERNED AND CONTROLLED BY THE BOARD THAT IS BEING COLLECTED. SO THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT TRULY INDEPENDENT AND NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE ASSOCIATION. UP THERE ALSO PROCEDURES FOR VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF THE BALLOT. AND A REMEDY IF SOMEONE'S LEFT OFF EITHER INADVERTENTLY OR ON PURPOSE. AND WE ALSO HAVE ADDRESS THE JUDICATA AND ELECTION DISPUTES. PROVIDING SOME VERY NEEDED GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS HERE'S PARTICULARLY SMALL CLAIMS COURTS. AND WITH THAT I'D MOVED. YIELD TO MY COLLEAGUE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND AN HONORABLE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS SHELLY DISTEFANO AND I PURCHASED MY CONDO IN AN H. AWAY WITH OVER SIX YEARS AGO. IT BECAME OBVIOUS EARLY ON THAT THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT COMPANY WERE ROUTINELY VIOLATING STATUTE AND GOVERNING DOCUMENTS WERE ENGAGED IN IMPROPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH VENDORS AND CONTRACTORS WHO OVER CHARGED INDEED FAULTY WORK. THEY USED THEIR POWER TO HER RASZYN TO FAME HOMEOWNERS WHO PUSHED BACK. AND WE LEARNED THAT A SMALL CLIQUE OF HOMEOWNERS HAVE BEEN ROTATING ON THE BOARD INCLUDING WITH THE SAME MANAGEMENT COMPANY FOR OVER TEN YEARS. SO -- WE DID THE OBVIOUS A NEIGHBOR AND I RAN FOR AND WON SEATS ON OR BOARD WE DISCOVERED ALL KINDS OF BEATING IRREGULARITIES WITH VENDORS INCLUDING ONE WITH A HALF MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT WHICH IS MORE THAN HALF OF OUR ANNUAL BUDGET -- IN WHICH THERE WAS A PRIMA PARTY CASE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE ANAGEMENT COMPANY. THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AND THE BIDDERS. I'VE DURING THE LAST FOUR ELECTION CYCLES WE TRY TO CHANGE THE BOARD MAKE UP BUT MULTIPLE STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN USED TO UNDERMINE THIS EFFORT. DISCOURAGING INTERESTED HOMEOWNERS FROM RUNNING. AND REMOVING NON COMPLIANT BOARD MEMBERS AND THEN BY BOARD VOTE FILLING THE SEATS WITH MORE COMPLIANT HOMEOWNERS WHO DON'T QUESTION THE ACTIONS THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY OR THE PRESIDENT OR VICE PRESIDENT WERE ALWAYS THE WOMAN. THEY SEEM TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE MEETINGS -- SO WHAT WERE THE STRATEGIES OR ONE OF US WAS SUBJECT TO A DOOR TO DOOR SLANDERS CAMPAIGN IT WITH WITH WHAT THEY DID TO HIM IN THE COMMUNITY AND AND HIS REPUTATION COMMUNITY WHICH IS REALLY. HEARTBREAKING ANOTHER WAS TOLD THAT THEY WEREN'T ELIGIBLE TO RUN FOR THE BOARD BECAUSE A LIGHT OVER THE GARAGE AT THE THE ASSOCIATION ITSELF IT REPLACED WAS OUT. AND BOTH MY NEIGHBORS AND I RUN LAWFULLY REMOVE FROM THE BOARD BY A SECRET VOTE WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS VOTE WAS TAKING PLACE AND I LEARNED THAT I WAS OFF THE BOARD TWO MONTHS LATER WHEN I WASN'T RECEIVING ANY INFORMATION. AND COURSE THE THEY GAVE ME THEIR APOLOGIES BUT THAT WAS IT THEY GAVE ME NO. INFORMATION SO MY PUSH BACK WAS MET WITH ESCALATED HARASSMENT. AND ABUSE OF POWER THEY THREATENED LEGAL ACTION AND THREATEN TO ASSIST ME WITH ANY LEGAL FEES IF THEY AND KURT. I RECEIVED THREATENING LETTERS FROM THEIR ATTORNEY -- BEING PAID THROUGH MY MY MY CHOICE ADD TO THAT I I PAY EVERY MONTH. AND MY INITIAL REQUEST FOR MEETING WAS DENIED. ULTIMATELY I WAS OBSESSED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH A FIFTY DOLLAR DAY PENALTY FOR SIX DIFFERENT UNFOUNDED VIOLATIONS WITHOUT BEING ABLE. TO FACE MY ACCUSERS DESPITE REPEATED REQUEST -- AND THAT INCLUDED A LETTER FROM THE ATTORNEY SAYING THAT THEY HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT AND THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO LET ME SEE. THE WITNESS STATEMENTS OR TO QUESTION MY MY THE WITNESSES AGAINST ME. THE BOARD CONTINUED -- AND THEN THIS WAS REALLY A THIS WAS AN EIGHT MONTH EXTREMELY STRESSFUL VERY DEMORALIZING PROCESSES IT WAS ATTENDED TO PUNISH ME AND TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE. OF ME THE WAY THEY DID WAS AT THAT -- MY NEIGHBORHOOD THEY DEFAMED -- THE BOARD CONTINUOUS SEVERAL OTHER VIOLATIONS THIS YEAR. PAYING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OVER CHARGES ON A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DESPITE WHAT THE CONTRACT PERMITTED. IMPROPERLY USING ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE -- TO DENY RECORD REQUESTS FROM HOMEOWNER SUGGESTED WITH THAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE TO EVERY REQUEST. TURNING CLAIM PRIVILEGE IN -- AND IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY HI -- IN AND THIRTY DAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION DESPITE REQUESTS FROM FOR AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY ALLEGING SPECTER BY BY ABOUT TWENTY DIFFERENT HOMEOWNERS. THE BOARD ADOPTED A WRITTEN RULE TEMPERAMENT TO CONSPIRING PROPERTY MANAGER TO SERVE AS THE ELECTION INSPECTOR. THIS WAS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE RULE MAKING STATUTE AS WELL AS OUR BY LAWS. OUR BY LAWS REQUIRE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY ELECTION SPECTER IT HAS FOR YEARS BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS USED THE PROPERTY MANAGER -- THEY KNEW THAT I SHOULD THE STATE UNIVERSITY WRONG ON THAT SEEM TO MATTER SO THAT'S WHY LEGISLATION LIKE. THREE TWENTY THREE IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE ABOUT THE SANCTITY IMPORTANCE OF A FAIR AND OPEN ELECTION PROCESS THAT CAN'T BE MANIPULATED. THE WAY IT'S BEING DONE IN OUR COMMUNITY BY COORDINATED EFFORTS OF THE PROPERTY MANAGER UNETHICAL AND ILL TRAINED. BOARD AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WHO OBVIOUSLY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THE ELECTION OUTCOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD.

MY NAME IS CRAIG MORE OCCURRED AND I AM THE CHAIRPERSON. OF BAR ASSOCIATIONS GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SUN CITY ROOSEVELT. TO MY LEFT. WE HAVE JACK ALISON HE'S A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMMITTING. AND PAST PRESIDENT OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS [inaudible] OUR ASSOCIATION. AND IN FACT I'M HERE TODAY NOT ONLY TO REPRESENT SUN CITY ROSEVILLE BUT ALSO SUN CITY LINCOLN. AND WHEN YOU COMBINE. THE NUMBER OF HOMES BETWEEN THOSE TWO ASSOCIATIONS. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND HOMES WITH SIXTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTS. TWO OF THE LARGER HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. EACH OF YOU OF BASICALLY RECEIVED ARE WRITTEN POSITION STATEMENTS. ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL SO OUR INTENT HERE TODAY IS NOT TO REITERATE OR DISCUSS THAT PARTICULAR LETTER YOU'VE PROBABLY READ IT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BASIS IN LOGIC FOR POSING. OF THIS LEGISLATION. WE DON'T INTEND TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO DO THAT OUR PURPOSE. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. IS TO TESTIFY IN PERSON TODAY TO INFORM YOU THAT. OR NOT LOBBYIST. WE'RE NOT ATTORNEYS. AND WE DON'T REPRESENT TRADE ASSOCIATIONS. WE DIRECTLY REPRESENT AND SPEAK. FOR THE RESIDENTS OF OUR ASSOCIATIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL IMPACT. WE ALSO ARE THE IMPLEMENTERS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LEGISLATION RETURN IN DETAIL AS PART OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND WE UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE IMPACT NOT ONLY. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PRIVACY BUT ADMINISTRATIVE -- THE DIVISIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE LOAD OF THE TASK TO ACHIEVE THE ACCOMPLICE YOU KNOW THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS LEGISLATION. WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO AND WE IMPLEMENTED. AND WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY HELD ELECTIONS IN OUR ASSOCIATIONS FOR OVER TWENTY THREE YEARS. NOW WE THANK. THEY'RE OUT OF FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE. THERE A NUMBER THAT HAVE DILIGENTLY FOLLOWED. THE LAW AND I'VE HAD FOR ELECTIONS. WITHOUT MISHAP. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT TO DENY WHAT WE RECENTLY HEARD. HERE FROM THE PROPONENTS. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME BOARDS AND ASSOCIATIONS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR MEMBERS. THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED WITH US. AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DILIGENT THEIR VOLUNTEERS. AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR HOMEOWNERS ARE SENIOR CITIZENS. SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE QUITE A CONCERN WITH ON THIS BILL -- AS IT'S CURRENTLY RICK WRITTEN. IS THAT IT WILL COMPROMISE WE FEEL OUR RESIDENTS PRIVACY OF IDENTIFYING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. THROUGH ITS PROPOSED ELECTION DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN ASSOCIATION RESIDENTS ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO A VOTE AGAINST THIS LEGISLATION. IT'S BASICALLY REDUNDANT IN OUR OPINION TO WHAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED BY DAVID STERLING. INFRINGES ON SIXTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTS TO MANAGE THEMSELVES SELF GOVERNANCE. AND RAISES SERIOUS PRIVACY ISSUES. FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU SIR. I DIDN'T -- IT ORIGINALLY INTEND TO SPEAK BUT AFTER HEARING THE TESTIMONY AND THE THE THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS. I'VE BEEN IN A HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION FOR FIFTY ONE YEARS. I LIVED IN SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA IN THE SEVENTY SIX UNIT. COM FOLLOW COMPLEX AND I CURRENTLY LIVE IN ROSEVILLE AND THIRTY ONE HUNDRED UNIT COMPLEX I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT SUNNYVALE. I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN ON THE BORG TWICE. AND I DON'T. EXPERIENCE IN ANY OF THE FIFTY THREE YEARS WHAT I'VE HEARD TODAY HERE. AND THAT'S ALL TO SAVE THAT. MOST HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE RUN UNDER THE AUSPICES AND FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE DAVIS STIRLING ACT. AND FOR MY POSITION. THIS BILL IS REDUNDANT. AND IS NOT NEEDED WHAT IS NEEDED IS MANAGEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL HOMES. HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS AND FIND IT DIFFICULT TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT LAW [inaudible] TORONTO. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE -- I THINK THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS ARE VERY WELL THERE ARE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND SO SHE XIN SO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BILL WAS VETOED LAST YEAR. GOVERNOR BROWN SAYS WITH A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. THERE ARE BAD ACTORS WE KNOW THAT IN EVERY INDUSTRY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT PREVIOUSLY TODAY -- AND YET THIS IS A AN APPROACH THAT TRIES TO PUT EVERYONE IN ONE BOX AND I THINK MANY OF THE SITUATIONS IN INSTANCES THAT WE HEARD OF BY THE PROPONENTS. MAY NOT GET CURED AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL BUT WHAT WE WILL DO IS PENALIZE THE GOOD ACTORS OUT THERE WITH SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES AND POTENTIAL COSTS. WITH THAT BEING SAID I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THE AUTHOR IN A STAFF. HAVING WORKED WITH THIS REALLY TO CLARIFY IN TECHNICALLY CORRECT MANY OF THE ISSUES -- THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS -- WE DO HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL OBJECTION TO THE IDEA OF NOT ALLOWING AN ASSOCIATION TO SET ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS. BUT MANY OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE BILL THAT WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED WITH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS I THINK OF REALLY SOMEWHAT BEEN RESOLVED IN AND IN SOME AREAS. MAKE THIS BILL A LITTLE BIT MORE WORKABLE SO I NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR AND A STAFF FOR DOING THAT EVEN THOUGH WE DO OPPOSE THE BILL. THANKS VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION THE BILL SO PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES.
