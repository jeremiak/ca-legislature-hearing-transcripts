OKAY. WHO WANTS TO START FIRST MA'AM? THANK YOU THE CORTES ISLAND ALLOW THE HALF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIR SENATOR ROTH FOR GIVING ME A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. THANK YOU -- BIG THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS ATTENTION A COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION IN THE BUDGET WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE WITH MORE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES PREPARING CALIFORNIANS A TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE WORK FORCE FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND BEYOND. SO WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR FOR PLAY I ALREADY ON EDUCATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO A STRONG PRODUCTIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH HIM. IN THE END THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WILL LIFT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS BY IMPROVING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND INCREASING THE RESOURCES THAT GO TO OUR SCHOOLS. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR AND FOCUSING THE CONVERSATION ON THE NEEDS OF THE EARLIEST LEARNERS. AND STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS EARLY EDUCATION AS YOU KNOW IS CRITICAL THIS CLOSING THE OPPORTUNITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AS EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS. AND PARTICULAR THOSE STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SO WE KNOW THAT 90% OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OCCURS BEFORE THE AGE OF FIVE SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR EDUCATION RESOURCES PROMOTE. A HEALTHY START FOR CHILDREN IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LIVE. IN ADDITION ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS HIGHEST PRIORITIES -- IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY SCHOOLS THAT ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO FOR TO SERVE THE STUDENTS AND SO THOSE ARE KNOWN AS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THE SCHOOLS WILL WORK WITH THEIR COUNTIES AND LOCAL PARTNERS WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE VERY REAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THESE THESE IF LEFT UNMET CREATE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FOR OUR SCHOOLS THE TOWNS THAT HAVE BECOME EVIDENT IN THE RECENT DISTRICT CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH LA UST IN OAKLAND. AND HERE IN SACRAMENTO A SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS CENTERED AROUND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS LIKE COUNSELORS SCHOOL NURSES AND LIBRARIANS. WE NEED TO CREATE A MEANINGFUL STRUCTURE STRUCTURES AND STRATEGIES AND RELATIONSHIP TO PROVIDE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES -- AND CONDITIONS TO ACCESS VITAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE BOTH IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WILL USE THIS INTEGRATED APPROACH TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NURSES COUNSELORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS CREATING PLACES WHERE CHILDREN. AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE SERVICES NEEDED TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IMPACT SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN IS SPONSORING LEGISLATION AB ELEVEN NINETY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. PROVIDING THE SUPPORTS WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS BE READY AND BE ABLE TO MEET THE ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED TO THEM IN CLASS. CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP REQUIRES ACCESS TO TOOLS INCLUDING ACCESS TO STEAM AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. OUR TEACHERS INCLUDING THOSE WORKING WITH OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO DO THIS ALONE WE NEED TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE AND PRACTICE BASED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE TOLS AND TRAINING NEEDED TO MAKE SURE ALL STUDENTS WE ARE READING BY THE THIRD GRADE. LITERACY IS A HUGE PRIORITY FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT AND IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ACADEMIC AND LIFE SUCCESS IT'S A KEY TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISONPIPELINE. WE NEED TO ENGAGE OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO CREATE A CULTURAL CULTURE OF LITERACY IN READING THAT INSTILLS THE LOVE OF LIFELONG. LEARNING TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE CAREERS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SO SPEAKING OF A PARENT OR COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE WORK FORCE HOUSING. THE OTHER EDUCATORS CAN LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY WORK IT'S VITAL THAT ARE DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICES RECRUIT THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST TEACHERS FOR STUDENTS. BUT IF WE INVEST IN OUR TEACHERS THEY WILL THEN BE ABLE TO INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN BY PROVIDING OUR TEACHERS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THE COMMUNITY THEY TEACH AND THEY CAN TAKE THEIR TWO HOURS OF COMMUTE TIME INVESTED IN A BUILDING STRONGER CONNECTION TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR EDUCATORS THEY DESERVE BETTER AND OUR STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER. TO REITERATE THE SUPERINTENDENT'S FIVE TOP PRIORITIES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS EARLY EDUCATION AND LITERACY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND WORK FORCE HOUSING. BEHALF THE SUPERINTENDENT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE MONTHS AHEAD AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY -- FOR THIS IN PRESIDENT OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES MEETING THEM IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LIVE IN PREPARING THE STUDENTS. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WORKFORCE THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM -- I NORMALLY WOULD HOLD QUESTIONS BUT IF -- RATHER PANELIST WOULD ALLOW ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF COURSE MAYBE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE WANTED TO AS WELL. YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME. WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS AND PUTTING THAT PROCESS IN PLACE -- HOW HOW EFFECTIVE DO YOU THINK THE REVIEW PROCESS IS FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS BECAUSE I HAVE SOME CONCERNS? AND I THINK THAT WITH THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THAT -- I THINK WE'VE HEARD BOTH SORT OF SIDES TO IT THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA A SERVE A PURPOSE TO ALLOW FOR THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY BUT WE'VE ALSO HEARD AND SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IT'S MEASURING. AND WHERE RESOURCES ARE GOING AND A HOME AND SO THIS ADMINISTRATION WITH US -- SUPERINTEND THURMAN WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE THAT AND REALLY LISTEN TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND IF IN FACT THE STUDENTS -- AND TEACHERS ARE REALLY -- USING THESE ROADS RESOURCES IF THEY'RE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY FOR THE NEEDY STUDENTS AND SO I THINK THAT STILL SOMETHING THAT WERE ASSESSING A COUPLE OF MINUTES A COUPLE MONTHS INTO THE THIS ADMINISTRATION. AND YOU MENTION NURSES AND COUNSELORS WE HEAR CONCERNS ABOUT THOSE -- THOSE POSITIONS AND THE ISSUE FROM CONSTITUENTS WITH SOME REGULARITY. HOW DO WE ENSURE HOW DO WE FORCE THE CONVERSATION DURING THE PREPARATION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN? TO FORCE THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE DISTRICTS AND THE STAKEHOLDERS. ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDING THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WITH REGARD. TO GETTING POSITIONS FOR SCHOOL COUNSELORS OR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS WE HAD A PRIORITY TO THE TO THE EIGHT THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE EL CAP PROCESS OR DO WE ED LANGUAGE UNDER SCHOOL CLIMATE TO FORCE THE CONVERSATION. SO THOSE ARE REALLY GREAT QUESTIONS AND I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S LIKE BEING KIND OF A FORCED. TO MAKE UP A REALLY HARD DECISION RIGHT. WHAT WHAT DO YOU USE THE FUNDING FOR YOU KNOW ARE YOU TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS IN THE PROFESSIONAL DON'T THAT DAHLE IF IT'S GOING CURRENTLY GOING ON? OR DO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT INCREASE FUNDING RESOURCES FOR SCHOOLS THE WORD JUST AT THE MINIMUM PROP NINETY EIGHT ADMINISTERS THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND I THINK ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT PRIORITIES REALLY IS. LOOKING AT OF DIFFERENT RESOURCES ARE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- WHETHER IT'S READING A REAL LOOKING UP THE PROP THIRTEEN THE SPLIT ROLE LOOKING AT TO SEE A SOME OF THE TAX CREDITS THAT'S BEEN THAT SPENT THAT -- NINETY EIGHT ALSO LOOKING AT OTHER -- BUDGET RESOURCES AND FISCAL RESOURCES -- AND LEVERAGING SOME HEALTH RESOURCES AS WELL TO HELP WITH THE NURSES AND SOME OF THE COUNSELOR NEEDS THAT ARE HAVING -- A GREAT IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS SO I I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WE CAN'T DO MORE WITH LESS OR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT IF WE WANT TO DO MORE THAN WE HAVE TO INVEST. IN THESE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO -- THE RESTOCKING THE SAME THAT IS NOT GOING TO GET YOU LESS OF SOMETHING. WE'LL IN TYING INTO THAT ON A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION AN ISSUE THAT IS DIRECTLY. BUDGET RELATED IS THE IS A SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANT PIECE OF LOCAL THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT TODAY YOU CAN HAVE DISTRICT ONE THAT HAS -- MORE THAN 55% ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH FOSTER KIDS. AND DISTRICT. TWO CONTINUOUS NEXT TO IT THAT HAS LESS THAN 55% THE LINE GOES DOWN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HAVE A SCHOOL ON ONE SIDE THAT HAS 90%. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS CENTER AND THE SCHOOL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINE THAT HAS 90%. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BUT IN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS AND ONE GETS OF THE BASS GRANT ABOVE THAT PERCENTAGE. AND THE OTHER DOES NOT. AND IT COST ASSEMBLY TO EDUCATE. THAT BODY OF STUDENTS INFO SCHOOLS IS IT TIME TO EXPLORE THE CONCENTRATION GRANT AND PERHAPS DEAL WITH THAT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY TIME TO EXPLORE -- IN EQUITY -- IN THOSE DISTRICTS AND SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA BE LOOKING AT THAT. PERFECT. WELL I'VE EXHAUSTED MY KNOWLEDGE AND MY QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] FAIRLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A GOOD MORNING TO ALL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THE PIZZA I FIRST HAVE TO DO A SHOUT OUT TO OUR SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND HE WAS IT WOULD CREST YEAR HIGH WITH ME LAST FRIDAY. IN ONTARIO AND I JUST THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC AND GOES TO HIS CHARACTER AND SHOWING HOW HANDS ON HE IS. THE STUDENTS LOVED HIM ALBEIT THEY MAY NOT KNOW WHO THE BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION DOES BUT YOU DON'T GET OUT THERE TELL THEM THEY'LL NEVER NOW. SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE HIM DOING THAT I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE STATE -- PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND THE EXPAND. CONSIDERING THE PRESCHOOL SLOTS GO UNUSED EVERY YEAR -- WILL NON ELLIE GAYS BE ABLE TO FILL THE TEN THOUSAND SLOT. SEVEN THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SERRA NOBLE MORGAN IS HERE ANSWER THAT VERY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OVER I AS THE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT ASK THESE QUESTIONS. THEN AS YOU KNOW IT ALSO INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S% PROPOSAL IS I JUST NOT FINDING FOR FACILITIES AS WELL AS WORK FOR SUPPORT. I THINK AS WE INVEST EXPANSION OF THE SYSTEM WE ALSO HAVE TO SUPPORT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM AND SO THOSE MAKE A LOT OF SMART. I'M CHOICES WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE NON TOWARDS COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS SINCE WE HAVE INVESTED IN THE ALLEY A SIDE QUITE A BAT. THE BALANCES THAT OUT AND ENSURES THAT WORKING FAMILIES BUT HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO IT BECAUSE THEY OFTEN PROVIDE MORE OF THE FULL DAY FULL YEAR. FOUGHT. OKAY VERY GOOD I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION MIGHT BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALEY -- WOULD WE WANT TO GIVE PRIORITY TO KIDS THAT HAVE BOTH PARENTS WORKING BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NEED MORE THAN A CHILD WITH ONLY ONE PARENT WORKING SO WHAT WE WORRY ABOUT IS. YOU KNOW IF IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE IN A FAMILY WHERE ONE PARENT STAYS HOME. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN BOTH PARENTS HAVE TO WORK COOL. AND THAT'S WHEN AT THAT TIME FOR QUESTIONS SO WE ALWAYS LOOK AT SINCE WE HAVE THAT'S THE CITY OF THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS THE ELIGIBILITY AND THEY NEED SECTION OF AT WHICH ARE THERE RIGHT NOW. AS WE LOOK TOWARDS FULL DAY FULL YEAR IT TYPICALLY MAKES SENSE TO SUPPORT THOSE WORKING FAMILIES -- BUT THERE ARE UNIQUE FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY THAT THE TWO PARENT WITH ONE PARENT WORKING. AND THERE MIGHT BE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THAT. THAT'S FAIR I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE THINK ABOUT THT. THAT'S ALL I HAVE THANK YOU SO MUCH. REALLY. WELL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING -- THANK YOU CHAIR ROTH AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR HAVING US TODAY -- ME LAWYER TEASE OAKLEY AND I HAVE THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF LEADING THE NATION'S LARGEST SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU. THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN. A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS NOW SINCE THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES. COMMITTED TO OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS -- AND WE CONTINUE TO BE GUIDED BY THAT VISION. A AND TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO AND CONTINUE TO RAISE ISSUES ABOUT EQUITY AND ENSURING THAT OUR SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS PREPARING OUR STUDENTS AND WORKING ADULTS. FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. WE'RE COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING OUR NOR START WHICH IS CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE REGION'S. BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND WE CONTINUE TO CHARGE FORWARD IN THAT DIRECTION. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WHAT YOUR STRONG SUPPORT WE ARE FOCUSED ON RESTRUCTURING OR COLLEGES SO THAT THEY CAN BE MORE STUDENT READY -- THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN A KEY PARTNER IN THAT WORK AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU PROVIDED-CRITICAL FUNDING FOR THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK THE COLLEGES. ARE CREATING MUCH CLEARER PATHWAYS TO EMPLOYMENT AND TO FURTHER EDUCATION. AND THEY'RE HELPING EVERY STUDENT CHOOSE AND ENTER A PATHWAY AND STAY ON THAT PATHWAY. YOU ALSO APPROVED THE ASSEMBLY BILL -- SEVEN OH FIVE WHICH GROUP WHICH COURSES THAT MAY DETER THEM. IN THEIR PURSUIT OF AN EDUCATIONAL GOAL -- UNLESS THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY NEED THOSE COURSES. THAT SAME YEAR -- WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. THE COMPONENTS THAT PROGRAM -- HIGH -- RESONATE VERY CLEARLY WITH ME -- FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN LONG BEACH -- WITH THE LONG BEACH COLLEGE PROMISE. WHERE IN LONG BEACH SCHOOL LEADERS FROM LONG BEACH UNIFIED WORK WITH FACULTY AND STAFF FROM CAL STATE LONG BEACH IN LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE? TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROMOTING A COLLEGE GOING CULTURE IN THAT COMMUNITY. SO NOW THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. IS MAXIMIZING ACCESS TO EXISTING FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS AND ENCOURAGING COLLEGES TO ENGAGE IN EVIDENCE BASED STUDENT SUCCESS STRATEGIES. IT AUTHORIZES FUNDING TO BE USED TO SUPPORT ONE YEAR FREE TUITION FOR ALL FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY INTENDED FOR THAT PURPOSE. THE EDITORIAL AWAY FEES IS ALSO LINKED TO SOME SPECIFIC CONDITIONS AT COLLEGES MERCED HERE. TO THEY MUST EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS WE THINK THIS IS CRITICAL WORKING WITH LOCAL K. TWELVE DISTRICT WITH LOCAL CAL STATE CAMPUSES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS. USING MULTIPLE MEASURES FOR ASSESSMENT EMPLACEMENT CONSISTENT WITH A. B.. SEVEN OH FIVE PARTICIPATINGTHE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK. ENSURING THE STUDENTS COMPLETE THE FEDERAL AND STATE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE GAINING ACCESS TO THE AID THAT THEY DESERVE. AND THAT THEY'RE PARTICIPATING IN THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM. I KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE LAST YEAR WERE. WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW ONLINE COLLEGE IN AND AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THOSE ENDEAVORS. THOSE CHANGES WILL REINFORCE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE GOALS. AND TO CREATE IMPORTANT YOU OPPORTUNITIES. FOR ADULTS WHO NEED THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO RESPOND IN THIS ECONOMY PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WORKING ADULTS -- THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE CHALLENGES OF AUTOMATION AND THE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY. I'M PROUD TO SHARE THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE COMMUNICATIVE DISTRICT NAME HEATHER HYLES. TO BE THE COLLEGE'S FIRST CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. HEATHER IS AN INNOVATOR SHE'S AN EDUCATOR. AND A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR WITH A DEEP COMMITMENT TO EQUITY IN EDUCATION. INTO CREATING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERSERVED PEOPLE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY OF INTRODUCING HEATHER TO ALL OF YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. ALSO. APPRECIATE THE CONFIDENCE A GOVERNOR'S SOME PLACES IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO THAT BILLS ON THE PRIOR REFORMS. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. BECAUSE IT BUILT ON THE FRAMEWORK CREATED UNDER AB NINETEEN WHICH STAB THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS FRAMEWORK IN AB NINETEEN MUST REMAIN IN PLACE. IF THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO HELP US ACHIEVE OUR GOALS IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. THAT PROPOSAL IS PART OF A BROADER THEME IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ADDRESSING COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY SO THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS CAN GAIN THE SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS NEEDED IN TODAY'S ECONOMY. LET ME UNDERSCORE THE URGENCY OF THIS WORK. TO ACHIEVE THE VISION FOR SUCCESS BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE REFORMS THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN. TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MUST BE COUPLED. WITH CHANGES TO THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT ADDRESS THE TRUE COST OF ATTENDING OUR COLLEGES FOR ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUNDS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET EXPANDS THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS WHO RELY AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE MOST. WE APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR NEW CAL GRANTS FOR STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN. AND FOR THE NEW COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS. WE'RE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL. TO SENATOR LEYVA. FOR AUTHORING SENATE BILL. TWO NINETY ONE TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENT FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. WE'RE VERY PROUD TO BE CO SPONSORS OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. THE BILL IS ALSO CO SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ITS SUPPORTERS REFLECT A BROAD COALITION INCLUDING OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. MANY OF WHOM WORK WITH THE STUDENTS EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES AND IN ADDRESSING THE BASIC NEEDS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THOUGH THE ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES THAT MOTIVATE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS PARTICULARLY AS A REFERS TO THIS FINANCIAL A PROPOSAL. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE REGARDLESS OF THE TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR THEIR HIGH SCHOOL GRADES. WE BELIEVE THAT A STUDENT'S FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE TRUE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE NOT JUST TUITION AND FEES BUT ALSO HOUSING. FOOD TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLIES. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID REGARDLESS OF THE STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL GOALS THAT IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE PURSUING A DEGREE. A CERTIFICATE OR SHORT TERM CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE AVAILABLE EQUITABLY. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUES -- IN THE UC CERTAINLY TRANSFER WHITE. PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO AND HER TEAM FOR ANY FINANCIAL AID AS WELL WE ARE ONE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. IN OUR OUTCOMES ARE INTERCONNECTED IN LENGTH AND WE MUST FOCUS ON STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ATTEND TODAY. BECAUSE THEY MOVE THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEMS AND WE WANT ENSURE THEIR SUCCESS. I BELIEVE THAT. THE PRINCIPLES AT ALL THE SYSTEMS HAVE -- ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE CONSISTENT WITH SB -- TWO NINETY ONE WE BUILD ON ON THE NOTION OF OF DOING NO HARM. MAINTAINING CAL GRANTS FOCUS ON TUITION COVERAGE MAINTAINING COLLEGES FOCUS ON THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND EXPANDING THE REACH OF THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID. MOVING FORWARD I WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO COMBAT THE ASSUMPTIONS. THAT ARE OFTEN MADE ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR VALUE. I HAVE HEARD SOME SAY EVEN SOME IN THIS BUILDING. THAT INVESTMENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IS NOT A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. DISAGREE MORE SORRY [inaudible] YES. DISAGREED VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE. BUT OVER THE COURSE. LIKE OTHER STUDENTS COMMITTEE BECAUSE STUDENTS TO FACE -- ENORMOUS CHALLENGES LIKE THE COST OF FOOD HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION 40% OF COMMITTEE BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE MANY OF YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS ALREADY. THERE THERE'S A SURVEY THAT WAS RELEASED TODAY AND THE RESULTS OF THAT SURVEY. SUGGESTS THAT HALF OF THE STUDENTS ATTENDING COMMIT CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE TROUBLE AFFORDING BALANCED MEALS OR WORRY ABOUT RUNNING OUT OF FOOD. AND NEARLY ONE IN FIVE ARE EITHER HOMELESS OR DO NOT HAVE A STABLE PLACE TO LIVE. THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE OF OUR SISTER INSTITUTIONS AS WELL. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ALREADY PAY. ALREADY WORK TO PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION NO THOSE AT STUDENTS WHO WORK EXCESSIVE HOURS -- ALSO UNDERMINE THEIR OWN EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS. AND FINALLY WE JUST BELIEVE THAT OUR STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DESERVE ACCESS THE FORT CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. SB NINETY ONE SB TWO NINETY ONE SPECIFIES INTENT THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BE INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. FOR THE PROGRAM I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO ENACT THAT APPROPRIATION. IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OTHER ISSUES. WE ARE MINDFUL THAT -- THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS CREATED BY MORE LIMITED GROWTH IMPROPER. NINETY EIGHT THEN WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN RECENT YEARS. WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA. I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S RACE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE DATA BEING USED IN THE FORMULA. AND WE ARE CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE DATA. WHICH WILL BE COMPLETED IN MAY AND HOPEFULLY INFORM YOUR DELIBERATIONS ON THE BUDGET. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE RELIEF ON PENSION COSTS. PENSION COSTS IN OUR SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM OR HAVE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON OUR COLLEGES ABILITY. TO DIRECT RESOURCES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED THE MOST IN THE CLASSROOM SO ANY RELIEF THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ON THE PENSION COSTS WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. FINALLY WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S. INCLUDING CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDS. FOR THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT FIFTEEN CONTINUING PROJECTS IN TWELVE NEW PROJECTS. WITH THAT SAID I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE TAT IN ENACTING PROP FIFTY ONE VOTERS CALLED FOR GREATER INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OR BOARD OF GOVERNORS APPROVED A TOTAL OF NINETEEN CONTINUING PROJECTS IN THIRTY NINE YOU PROJECTS OUR OFFICE WILL BE WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE. A TO GET FUNDING OF FOR THOSE PROJECTS. SO -- THE LAST THING I WILL RAISE IS AT THE GOVERNOR HAS ALSO PROPOSE A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF ALL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA -- YOU WILL TALK ABOUT THIS IN YOUR SECOND PANEL BUT I WANT TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSAL. UP I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND BE MY PLEASURE TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU ELEVEN QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AGAIN. I AM A BIG FAN OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT'S WHERE I STARTED AT MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE MOUNT SAC BACK IN THE DAY WILL TAKE HOW LONG AGO SOME YOU MIGHT THINK I'M YOUNGER THAN I AM -- AND I WOULD I'VE YEARS AGO MAYBE YEAH YEAH COULDN'T LOVE IT. A BIT I HAD THE BEST ENGLISH CLASS OF MY WHOLE COLLEGE CAREER AT MOUNT SAC. AND WHEN I HEARD THAT PAYING MORE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEN THEY WERE TO ATTEND THE UC OR SEE ISSUE JUST STRICTLY BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL AID WASN'T AVAILABLE TO THEM I JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO -- SO WHATEVER -- I CAN CONTINUE TO DO TO BE SUPPORTIVE I WILL I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET SB TWO NINETY ONE TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THERE'S AN OLD SAYING THAT SAYS DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE SHOW ME WHERE YOUR SPEND YOUR MONEY AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES. ARE SO WE SAY THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE AND NOT ALWAYS CHILDREN A COMMUNICABLE JUST BUT IF WE REALLY DO WANT THEM TO SUCCEED THEN WE NEED TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. IN THE MEANTIME -- BEFORE WE HOPEFULLY GET THAT BILL TO THE GOVERNOR AND GET IT SIGNED. HOW DO YOU SEE HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE USING THE DOLLARS MOST EFFICIENTLY ARE YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED STUDENT SUCCESS? SO CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT HOW YOU'RE USING THE MONEY IN THAT AND AND THE EVIDENCE BASED STUDENT SUCCESS YES. SO -- YOU KNOW WITH HIGHER EDUCATION -- AND WITH THE COMMUNICATIVE SPECIFICALLY ME WE HAVE THE GREAT PRIVILEGE IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES OF ACCEPTING THE TOP 1100% OF STUDENTS. EVERY STUDENT WHO HAS A DESIRE TO ACCESS CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES. WITH THAT SAID THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NEEDS THAT APPROACH -- COLLEGES ON ANY GIVEN DAY. AND SO -- FIRST WE WANT TO TRY TO DIRECT THE PRECIOUS RESOURCES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED. TO AREAS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS IN BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS OR THE GATEWAY TO HIGHER EDUCATION. TO STUDENTS OF COLOR IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT WE ARE HALF WAY FOR THEM. US SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE TIME TO COMPLETION FOR THEM -- OUR STUDENTS COME BECAUSE THEY WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MOBILITY -- AND WHILE OUR COLLEGES DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER EVERY DAY TO DO THAT IN MANY CASES THE WAY THAT WE STRUCTURE ORGANIZATIONS. A KEEPS OUR STUDENTS IN OUR CLASSROOMS IN OUR CAMPUSES FAR LONGER THAN THAN THEY NEED TO BE. AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OFCREDITS THAT OUR STUDENTS ACCUMULATE THAT DON'T LEAD TO THEIR EAT EDUCATIONAL GOAL. OF WE HAVE ENACTED REFORMS THAT TO ALLOW OUR STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES AS SOON AS THEY GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. USING THE MULTIPLE MEASURES PLATFORM TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HIGH SCHOOL GPA HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS IS A BETTER PREDICTOR OF SUCCESS THAN STANDARDIZED PLACEMENT EXAMS -- WE'RE ALSO -- WORKING WITH OUR COLLEGES -- IMPLEMENTING THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE IN ENSURING THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE WAIVING FEES AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HEARING COLLEGES HAVE THE LOWEST FEES IN THE COUNTRY -- THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES NOT TO WISH WHICH IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN OUR SISTER INSTITUTIONS. ON THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CAUSES ACOSTA TRANSPORTATION BOOKS SUPPLIES. THE COST OF NOT HAVING TO WILL -- AND BEING ABLE TO TAKE A FULL LOAD AND GET TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES GROWTH IS POSSIBLE SO WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR COLLEGES TO ENSURE THAT. THE FUNDS UNDER A. B. NINETEEN THAT WERE APPROPRIATED GO TO SUPPORT A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO NOT ONLY GAIN ACCESS TO OUR COLLEGES. WITHOUT PAYING A FEE BUT TO GET THROUGH OUR COLLEGES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT'S A UP A SMALL SLICE OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING SO TO REDUCE COMPLETION TIME. IS THAT OFFERING MORE SECTIONS OF A PARTICULAR SUBJECT -- IN AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT REDUCING CREDITS THAT -- STUDENTS TAKE BEGIN HAVE BEEN OF CLASSES THEY DON'T REALLY NEED DO THEY END UP TAKING THOSE CLASSES BECAUSE WHAT THEY REALLY NEED ISN'T AVAILABLE AND IT JUST TRYING TO STAY. IN THE RHYTHM SO TO SPEAK BUT HOW HOW DO WE REDUCE THAT TIME SPECIFICALLY SAID OPENING MORE SECTIONS. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- SO STUDENTS COME TO COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL GOALS BUT LET'S JUST SAY STUDENT COMES THE OMMUNICANTS. WANTING -- TO TRANSFERRED TO THEIR CSU CAMPUS AS AN ENGLISH MAJOR. OUR GOAL IN THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK IS TO ENSURE THAT FROM DAY ONE THE DAY THEY HAD THE CAMPUS THEY HAVE A CLEAR ROADMAP. TO HOW TO MAKE THAT TRANSFER HAVE -- SO FROM DAY ONE WE ARE HELPING GUIDE THEM WITH THE ROADMAP I GUIDED PATHWAYS TO ENSURE. THAT THEY'RE NOT STRAY FROM IT NOW. THAT DOESN'T PREVENT A STUDENT FROM WANTING TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL COURSE BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE TAKING AN ADDITIONAL COURSE BUT IF THEY'RE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST TWELVE UNITS TO RECEIVE FULL AID. THEN THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO FIND COURSES THAT DON'T TRANSFERRED TO THEIR TO HELP THEM TRANSFER IS AN ENGLISH MAJOR. TO OUR COLLEGES REALLY HAVE -- TO RESTRUCTURE THE CLASS SCHEDULE REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THE STUDENT WHERE THEY'RE AT AND ALSO -- BECAUSE OF AB SEVEN OH FIVE MOVE THE STUDENT TO A TRANSFER LEVEL CORES -- IN ENGLISH AND MATH WITHIN THEIR FIRST YEAR -- SO THAT IS -- MAY BE A DIFFICULT TASK FOR SOME OF OUR COLLEGES -- BUT IS A NECESSARY TASK AND IT DOVETAILS VERY WELL WITH THE WORDS HAPPY IN THE CSU AROUND THEIR OWN REMEDIATION REFORM SO WE HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT REMEDIAL EDUCATION THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN APPROACH AND IT DOES NOT WORK HAS A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW. INCOME STUDENTS SO WE'RE WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS THAT AND GET STUDENTS TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. VERY GOOD SO I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR IT BUT DO YOU FEEL LIKE EVEN IN THE CAMPUSES WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT THAT YOU ARE CHANGING THE STRUCTURE THERE AND YOU HAVE A PATHWAY FORWARD. I AM VERY CONFIDENT BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS EVIDENCE FROM CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IN A PARTICULARLY AND I KNOW THE INLAND EMPIRE IS WELL REPRESENTED ON THIS -- THE COLLEGES IN THE DISTRICT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE DOING TREMENDOUS WORK IN THIS REGARD AND I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE -- THAT -- THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IS GOING TO LEAD TO THOSE IMPROVED OUTCOMES VERY GOOD THANK YOU CHANCELLOR OAKLEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THERE WERE ONLY QUESTIONS. CHANCE TO THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. THIS IS DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE THE ENROLLMENT FEES FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE. THAT'S CORRECT RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT DO YOU HAVE OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT WAIVE FEES FOR STUDENTS. SO -- ALL OF THE FEE WAIVERS ARE CAPTURE IN THE UMBRELLA OF WHAT WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE NO THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. THERE ARE WHAT WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA COLLEG PROMISE. GRANTS WHICH ARE FORMALLY KNOWN THE BOARD OF GOVERNOR FEE WAIVERS SO WE WAIVE FEES FOR ALL LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF STUDENTS SHOW THAT THERE'S A FINANCIAL NEED THEY QUALIFY FOR THE FEE WAIVER THAT WAS IN EFFECT BEFORE. AB NINETEEN WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM. NEARLY 50% PARTICIPATE IN THAT FREEWAY FROM THE WAY HOME THEN THERE'S THE OTHER 50% AND THEN THERE'S THE OTHER 50% WHICH A. B.. NINETEEN AUTHORIZED THE USE OF STATE FUNDS TO WAIVE FEES FOR ALL FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS AND THIS IS WITHOUT REGARD TO NEED. THIS IS WITHOUT REGARD TO NEED HOWEVER TO HAVE NEED WILL AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THEIR FEES WAVE SO IN ADDITION TO THOSE LOW INCOME STUDENTS AB NINETEEN ALLOWS THE COLLEGES. TO DIRECT THOSE FUNDS TO WAIVE FEES FOR STUDENTS WHO DID NOT MEET THAT THRESHOLD. THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY WHICH IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IF A COLLEGE FEELS THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF NEED AT THEIR COLLEGE THEY CAN USE THOSE SAME FUNDS AND NOT WAIVE FEES BUT YOU SOME FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE THAT THEY FEEL. WOULD BENEFIT THEIR STUDENTS -- EVEN MORE ALTHOUGH NOT SO THAT THE MONEY IS NOT RESTRICTED TO A WAIVER OF ENROLLMENT FEES IT IS ONLY RESTRICTED TO EITHER A A FEE WAIVER OR SHOWING EVIDENCE THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING USED -- TO IMPROVE A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO SUCCEED SO PRESENTATION VOUCHERS FOR YES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A COLLEGE -- HAS A VERY HIGH A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY -- WHICH ALREADY QUALIFIES FOR THE FEE WAIVER. THEY CAN USE THOSE AB NINETEEN FUNDS -- FOR SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT IKE TRANSPORTATION VOUCHERS LIKE BOOK VOUCHERS -- PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL LITERACY SUPPORT SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS IT CAN BE USED BUT ITS PRIMARY FUNCTION. IS TO REDUCE THE BARRIER OF FOR STUDENTS GETTING INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BARRIER. SO IT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEN THE PURPOSE. IN THE IMPLEMENTATION YOU'RE GONNA BE DIRECTING THIS MONEY TOWARD. THOSE STUDENTS. WHO HAVE NEED? THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAVE NEED AND THE BECAUSE THAT WOULD WHEN YOU READ IT ON ITS FACE RIGHT IT SOUNDS LIKE. THE NEEDY STUDENTS GET WHAT USED TO BE CALLED THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WAIVER RIGHT. AND THEN THOSE WHO DON'T NEED ANY ASSISTANCE QUALIFY FOR THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM MONEY IS ON THEIR FIRST TIME AND FIRST TIME STUDENT FULL TIME IN FIRST FIRST TIME. BUT NOT NECESSARILY CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN DIVERT THAT MONEY FOR TRANSPORTATION VOUCHERS AND THE LIKE TO THE MOST NEEDY YOU COULD YOU COULD AND THE OTHER REASON FOR THE FLEXIBILITY IS THAT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES -- FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW -- LONG BEACH AND STUDENTS AND BURNED A DINO -- HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT SO WE WANT. COLLEGES TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THEIR PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT SO. WHERE I CAME FROM LONG BEACH THE COMMUNITY SO AB NINETEEN ALLOWED LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL YEAR? OF FREE TUITION SO THERE ARE NUMBER OF WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES HAD SOME FLEXIBILITY DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL SITUATION AND WHO MAKES THE DECISION AS TO HOW THAT MONEY IS USED IN THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WHO DECIDES. THAT -- ONCE THE NEEDIEST STUDENTS OR OR TAKING CARE OF THROUGH THE WHAT USED TO BE CALLED THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WAIVER. THAT THE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO GO TO THE THE THE TOP 25% IN TERMS OF ASSETS BUT INSTEAD IS GOING TO FUND TRANSPORTATION VOUCHERS AND BOOK OF FEES AND THE LIKE WHO MAKES THAT DECISION -- THE LOCALLY ELECTED BOARDS OF TRUSTEES. IN THOSE AREAS. NOW WITH RESPECT TO METRICS WHAT. DOES PROGRAM'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE THE FIRST YEAR. YES SO THE THE PROGRAM WAS FUNDED IN THE LAST BUDGET SO IT IS. STILL IN ITS FIRST YEAR -- ALTHOUGH WE HAVE EVIDENCE FROM PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY BEEN EXISTENCE OF FOR MANY YEARS THAT SUGGESTS THAT. IT HAS A A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE MOUNT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS -- ATTENDING COLLEGE RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL DO YOU HAVE A SET OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE WITH THE PROGRAM. SO THE ANSWER IS YES PRIMARILY THE GOALS ARE TO SATISFY THE GOALS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SO WE SEE THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISES A COMPONENT -- AS A VERY POSITIVE -- A STEP IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS HAS SOME SPECIFIC GOALS FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CREDENTIALS EARNED. A AT A COLLEGE CAMPUS BY A 20% ANNUAL ANNUALLY INCREASING TRANSFER BY 35% ANNUALLY -- AS WELL AS CLOSING THE IT WITHIN TEN YEARS SO. WE SEE THAT CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISES A COMPONENT OF THAT STRATEGY AND WE WILL BE MEASURING THE IMPACT -- BASED ON THOSE METRICS AND AND IS THE DATA BEING COLLECTED CENTRALLY BY YOUR OFFICE OR HOUSE YES. IT IS COLLECTED CENTRALLY BY OUR OFFICE AND REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM [inaudible] WHAT? WHAT'S MAYBE WE COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC AS TO THE ISSUES THAT YOU SEE WITH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM YOU'VE MENTIONED. THAT OF COURSE THE COST OF EDUCATION IS NOT JUST A FEES INVOLVED BUT THE ASSOCIATED LIVING EXPENSES AND THE LIKE. I'M A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT I GRADUATE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO -- A COURSE AROUND FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND I FINALLY THREE SOUND LIKE ME. TELL ME. I FINALLY FIGURE OUT THAT I'M GONNA NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. TO BE ABLE TO GET A CREDENTIAL AND GUESTS AND ARE LIVING. AND I AND ROLL BUT SORT OF CAL GRANT OPPORTUNITIES DO I HAVE A ZERO POINT. SO IF YOU GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFTER -- BEING AT A HIGH SCHOOL FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR YOU BEGIN TO LOSE ELIGIBILITY OR IF YOU GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFTER. A CERTAIN AGE YOU LOSE ELIGIBILITY -- SO THERE ARE AS WELL AS IF YOU DON'T HAVE -- HIGH ENOUGH GPA RIGHT I AT SCHOOL YOU MAY LOSE ELIGIBILITY SIR AND THEIR NUMBER OF BARRIERS IN THE WAY AND THAT'S WHY. PARTICIPATION THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM FOR COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS IS LESS THAN 10% -- SO IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE -- BECAUSE WE PRIMARILY SERVE ADULTS STUDENTS AVERAGE AGES TWENTY FIVE IN OUR SYSTEM -- AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A ANYA WE ARE CERTAINLY AT FAULT FOR CREATING THIS MYTH THAT IS INEXPENSIVE TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BECAUSE OF THE LOW COST OF TUITION. BUT OF THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS IS DONE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PARTICIPATION. IN THE CAL GRANT AND IN THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. IT HIS BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT TO ATTEND. AND SO THE OTHER REASON IS YOU COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IF YOU CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM. YOU TEND TO HAVE TO WORK -- OR IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN GO PART TIME SO THAT EXTENDS THE TIME THAT YOU'RE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO RE LOOK AT THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. IN THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM BECAUSE WERE CERTAINLY NOT TALKING ABOUT. REDIRECTING FUNDS IN THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM WE WANT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE CAR BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IF I JUMP RIGHT IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF HIGH SCHOOL OR MAY BE WAS CERTAINLY WITH ANY OF YOUR THAT I'M. AUTOMATICALLY ENTITLED TO A CAL GRANT OF ONE FLAVOR OR ANOTHER. YOU YOU ARE CERTAINLY ENTITLED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CAN COMPETITIVE CABINET I MEAN. AND IF I WAIT TWO OR THREE YEARS I FALL INTO THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM DONA. IDIOM AND AGAIN THE NUMBER OF THOSE IS WHAT THIRTY THOUSAND IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OR SO -- I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER OF THOUGHT MY HEAD BUT IS SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE AND SOMEONE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS. FOR THAT PARTICULAR CATEGORY THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S PROBABLY AN ACCURATE NUMBER SO THE THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING AND HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON APPEAR IN SACRAMENTO FOR SOME TIME WITH. CAREER TECH EDUCATION. TAKING PEOPLE WHO WERE INSTALLED -- OCCUPATIONS AND AND ALLOWING THEM TO RE TOOL SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE MARKET PLACE IN A IN A BETTER WAY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY CUT THEM OUT OF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WHEN IT COMES TO CAL GRANT PARTICIPATION UNLESS THEY FALL WITHIN THE 10% THAT HAPPENS TO GET. YES AN AWARD YES AND WE HAVE VERY LOW PARTICIPATION IN THE CHARACTER AND SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW IT IS WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL AS A SYSTEM WE HAVE NOT -- LOOK TO FINANCIAL AID IN THE SAME WY THE UC AND CSU LOOKS AT IT I MEAN YOUR OF YOUR STUDENT GOING TO UC. YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY ASSAULTED BY THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE PACKAGE FOR FINANCIAL AID AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR -- WE HAVE TO TAKE FINANCIAL AID VERY SERIOUS IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY. WE'RE NOT ONLY ASKING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM BUT WE ARE ALSO COMMITTING TO INCREASING. OUR CAPACITY IN OUR FINANCIAL FINANCIAL AID OFFICES IN OUR EXPECTATION THAT WE PACKAGE STUDENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM DAY ONE WELL I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL OF YOU OR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM BUT AS A AS A LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY AS THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK IF WE IF WE MEAN. WHAT WE SAY WITH RESPECT TO HEALTH EDUCATION AND CAREER TECH EDUCATION AND? LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF THESE STALLED THE OCCUPATIONS IN CAREER FIELDS AND GIVING THEM. A LEG UP TO BE SUCCESSFUL WERE GONNA HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB. ON THE CAL GRANT SIDE BY ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE A HAVE MORE THAN A 10% CHANCE RIGHT -- TO GET SOME SOME MADE OUT OF THE SYSTEM TO CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS -- ABSOLUTION ROW HI I CENTER I WENT TO A CITRUS COLLEGE LOVED IT A GREAT SCHOOL -- TOOK FIFTEEN UNITS. A SEMESTER AND THEN AND THERE IN THE SUMMER SCHOOL I WOULD. TRY TO TAKE A FEW MORE HOURS. FORTUNATE TO GET THROUGH IN TWO YEARS AND I WORK THIRTY TWO HOURS A WEEK RIGHT YOU KNOW. ON THE U. KIND OF MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A NEGATIVE THING I'M TRYING. TO RIGHT COULD YOU WALK ME THROUGH THERE BECAUSE BACK IN THOSE DAYS THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESE PROGRAMS AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS A HARDSHIP MAYBE IT DEVELOP CHARACTER AND ME I'M. SURE BUT IF YOU WOULD. SO -- IF THE FIRST THING I'D SAY IS AT I ALSO. WORK MY ENTIRE TIME THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND IT UC IRVINE -- RAISING A FAMILY AS WELL SO THE ISSUE IS AND WHETHER OR NOT. OUR STUDENTS SHOULD -- FIND WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR EDUCATION THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY ARE. PREDOMINATELY ALL OUR TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEIR OWN EDUCATION BECAUSE OF THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE TODAY -- WE HAVE A HUGE -- HOUSING AND SECURITY PER FOOD AND SECURITY PROBLEMS IN THE STATE THE COST OF LIVING HAS. RISEN TREMENDOUSLY CERTAINLY MORE THAN MY TIME GOING TO BE A COLLEGE AND AND YES -- MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO TODAY. THE THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THAT -- THEY DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID THAT ALLOW THEM TO WORK AND TO RECEIVE SOME SUPPORT SO THEY CAN GET THROUGH AS QUICKLY. AS POSSIBLE -- SO -- YOU KNOW. FOR FOR FOR US -- I MEAN WHETHER YOU'RE IN COMMITTEE COLLEGE -- CS YOUR UC THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THE FAMILY OR THE INDIVDUAL OR CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR EDUCATION WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR OUR STUDENTS TO BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY. WERE ASKING IS THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL AID TO HELP THEM FINISH THEIR EDUCATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE A AND TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ECONOMY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE THINK THAT THAT'S A WISE INVESTMENT BECAUSE IF THEY'RE IN. THE WORK FORCE WITHIN THREE YEARS NOT SIX YEARS THEN THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING IN A MEANINGFUL WAY TO THEIR FAMILIES THE OTHER ISSUE IS. YOU KNOW WE WERE WERE LIVING% ENVIRONMENT TODAY WHERE THEIR DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION CREDENTIAL IS MUCH GREATER THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR ECONOMY -- AND SO WE'RE ASKING A LOT MORE PEOPLE. THE COME BACK TO COLLEGE. IN THE WAY THAT CENTER ROUGH IS INDICATED AND GET SOME SORT OF A CREDENTIAL -- SO -- WELL. WE WE BELIEVE IN AND CERTAINLY IT'S A CASE BASED ON ALL THE DATA THAT WE SEE. THE MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE WORKING IN ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR EDUCATION BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THEM -- IN A SITUATION WHERE THE COST OF LIVING WHETHER IN THE BAY AREA AND INLAND EMPIRE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO GROW EACH AND EVERY DAY. I THINK. FOR LET ME SHOULD JUST LET ME SHIFT TO CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. IT'S A SORT OF A PET PEEVE WITH ME -- OKAY TO TWELVE OBVIOUSLY HAS SORT OF A REGIMENTED PERHAPS ANTIQUATED CUMBERSOME PROCESS -- FOR BUT FIRST IN TIME FIRST IN LINE I GUESS -- FOR PROJECT MONEY COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE CAPITAL OUTLAY OF PROCESS IS A LOT SEEMS TO BE A LOT DIFFERENT. AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH RHYME OR REASON. TO HELP PROJECTS ARE -- ULTIMATELY SELECTED. I REALIZE YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST A COG IN THE WHEEL BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD. ADDRESS THAT FOR ME. WELL -- THE FIRST IS THAT SOMEONE WHO CAME FROM A COLLEGE IN WHOSE JOB IT WAS -- TO FIND WAYS TO FINANCE CAPITAL PROJECTS -- YOU KNOW -- WE BECOME VERY ADEPT AT PLAYING THE GAME OF CAPITAL PER -- AND IN MANY WAYS IT IS SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A FORMULA IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE JUST THAT IS -- A VESTIGE FROM THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM -- WE GO THROUGH A PROCESS EVERY YEAR TO RANK PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WE PRESENT THEM TO OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS A PERCENT THEM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND DETERMINES WHAT CRITERIA THEY'RE GOING TO USE -- AND WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT. BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CRITERIA THAT WE HAVE OUR COLLEGES WORKING ONAND THEN THAT GOES BEFORE THE COMMITTEES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN THERE IS A PROCESS OF ANGLING. MEMBERS ON COMMITTEES TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT THEIR PROJECTS ARE PUT ON THE LIST OR ENSURE THAT THEY SURVIVE ON THE LIST SO IS A VERY -- A DIFFICULT PROCESS ART SO YOU MEAN. FOR AS A SYSTEM. YOU AND YOUR BOARD. RANK PROJECTS YES USING A CRITERIA THAT PRESUMABLY RELATES TO THE CORE MISSION OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SOME FASHION YES AND THAT LIST IS SUBMITTED. AND THEN SOMEONE OTHER THAN EDUCATORS. RE ORDERS THE LIST YES.% EARLY HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COST OF THE PROJECTS OR THE BOND MONEY AVAILABLE. WELL OUT OUT I WON'T I WON'T COMMENT ON THE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES TO PERSPECTIVE. FRIENDS I AT WE ACTUALLY. BUT YES THERE ARE MULTIPLE PLACES WHERE THOSE PROJECTS ARE RE ORDERED -- IN WEEK WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS ONCE THEY GET INTO COMMITTEE HERE THERE'S ANOTHER REORDERING OR POTENTIAL REORDERING. HOW MANY -- SO THE BUDGETS PROPOSING THREE HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION AND PROP FIFTY WENT ONE FUNDS. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECTS. I FORGET HOW MUCH MONEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE WAS ALLOCATED OF THE PROP FIFTY ONE WAS A TWO TWO BILLION -- SO I'D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT NUMBER I DON'T RECALL IT ON MY HEAD IN ANY EVENT YOU KNOW HOW THE THE TOTAL NEED IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM VOB THE PROP FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDS AVAILABLE -- WELL I KNOW THAT -- THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS AT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS APPROVED IN TOTAL IS THE TOTAL WOULD ADDRESS THE TOTAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE IN PROP FIFTY ONE WE CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU THAT THAT. THAT DOLLARS DOLLAR NUMBER BUT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS APPROVED EVERY PROJECT THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED BASED ON THE VOTERS INTENT IN PROFIT. THANK YOU WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT WILL FOCUS ON THAT -- I ASSUME A LITTLE LATER IN THE PROJECT AND I HAVE ONE MORE. QUESTION AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANELIST. YOU REFERENCE THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WHAT WHAT LINK WHAT LINKAGE ARE YOU DEVELOPING BETWEEN YOUR ONLINE EDUCATION EFFORTS? AND THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY RIGHT -- TO DETERMINE THAT WHAT JOB SKILLS ARE NEEDED. OUT THERE. AND MAKE SURE AND ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS IF YOU'RE DESIGNING. MEET THOSE NEEDS BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS BUT THAT'S ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS OVERALL WITH THE CREW TECH EDUCATION SYSTEM IN OUR STATE. IS. ALTHOUGH IT'S SOMEWHAT ANECDOTAL BUT THE EDUCATION CONSORTIUM. SEEM TO BE WORKING WELL. BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT REGIONALLY WITH THE EMPLOYERS AND JOB SKILLS INVENTORY TO CONNECT JOB SKILLS NEEDED WITH THE EDUCATION CONSORTIUM THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING DESIGNED. SO MY QUESTION RIGHTS TO DO WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND I AGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT SENATOR AND AND OBVIOUSLY MY MAILLET A SOLUTION TO THAT FOR LITTLE BIT A CAUSE ME A LITTLE BIT HE LAST YEAR BUT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT -- WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY -- INITIATIVES IN PROCESS ONE AS YOU JUST MENTIONED IS IS A NEW ONLINE COLLEGE WHICH IS -- AIM TO BE A COMPANY BASED PLATFORM THAT PULLS TOGETHER BOTH HIRING MANAGERS AND THE INCUMBENT OR DISPLACED WORKERS SO. THE WAY THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THAT WITHIN THAT CONTEXT AND WITHIN THAT CONTEXT IT IS OUR INTENT TO THEN EXPANDED THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. IS IN I'LL TAKE ONE EXAMPLES -- IN HEALTH CARE -- WE HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER A COALITION OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS LIKE DIGNITY OPTUM KAISER AND OTHERS. pSEIU -- AND THE UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND PUT THEM AT THE SAME TABLE -- LOOKED AT THE JOB SAID IN THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THE EMPLOYER IS EITHER -- WHERE THERE'S A GAP OVER THE IN FUTURE YEARS AND THEN -- WORKING BACKWARDS LOOKING AT THE SKILLS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND THEN BUILDING A MODULE FOR THE WORKER AND THEN TESTING THAT OUT WITH THE WORKER. AND ALONG THE LINE ENSURING THAT THERE IS A CLEAR SIGNALING MECHANISM BETWEEN. THE EDUCATION THAT THE WORKERS BEING PROVIDED AND DEMONSTRATING SUCCESS IN AND THE HIRING MANAGER NICE A HIRING MANAGER BECAUSE YOU KNOW HR OFFICES AREN'T ALWAYS HIRING MANAGERS HIRING MANAGERS OF PEOPLE ON THE GROUND SUPERVISORS MANAGERS WHO ACTUALLY MAKE HIRING DECISIONS AND HAVE. A NUMBER OF BIASES THAT WE NEED. TO TO SMOOTH OUT SO THE LINK THE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE SEE IS THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THAT SIGNALING TO OCCUR AND IN MANY CASES ARE OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE NOT EITHER SIGNALING CLEARLY OR TAKING TOO MUCH TIME. TO CATCH UP WITH THE SKILLS THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING. FOR THE ECONOMY IS MOVING MUCH FASTER TODAY THAN IT DID FIVE TEN YEARS AGO. SO WE'RE USING THE ONLINE COLLEGE TO BUILD OUT -- A CASE STUDY FOR HOW IT COULD BE DONE FASTER AT ALL HUNDRED FOURTEEN OF OUR COLLEGES SO AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO APPROACH THIS. WELL THAT COULD IMPROVE OUR REGIONAL COURTEOUS EDUCATION EFFORTS AS WELL I LOOK FORWARD THE RESULT. SO DO I THANK YOU [inaudible] CAUSING FURTHER. THANK YO THANK YOU CHESTER WHITE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. I WAS GONNA SAY GOOD MORNING BUT IT'S ALMOST WELL GOOD GOOD MID MORNING EVEN A BETTER ONE OF MIKE SUBCOMMITTEES BEFORE. WE SERVE DINNER. ORTEGA CHICKEN SALAD PLEASE AND GLASS OF RED WINE. THANK YOU CHAIR OFF INTO THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY I THE GOVERNOR'S WAS FIRST BUDGET PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A BOLD AND HISTORIC COMMITMENT. TO INVEST IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WE ARE APPRECIATIVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INDICATES IS RECOGNITION OF OUR CAREFUL STEWARDSHIP OF STATE FUNDS. IN THE SUCCESSES THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH RESPECT TO STUDENT ACCESS TO A QUALITY PROGRAMS AND TO GETTING STDENTS SO TO DEGREE COMPLETION. BUT MORE THAN AND INVESTMENT I THINK HIS PROPOSED BUDGET REFLECTS A SHARED VISION FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND IN ITS CRITICAL ROLE. IN HELPING CALIFORNIA COULD CREATE AND REALIZES BRIGHTEST FUTURE. DIVISION THAT HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT. TODAY I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT -- CAL STATE UNIVERSITY IT IS VISION IS BEING REALIZED IN REALLY CREATIVE IN AND INDEED HISTORIC WAYS. OF MANY EXAMPLES LIKE IT'S WE JUST FOCUS ON ONE THAT IS A GRADUATION INITIATIVE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT PROVIDES PERHAPS THE MOST COMPELLING EVIDENCE HE WE LAUNCH THISIN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH. AGGRESSIVE AMBITIOUS GOALS WITH RESPECT TO IMPROVING STUDENT GRADUATION RATES WELL ELIMINATING EQUITY CRAPS AMONG OUR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY FROM THOSE WHO COME FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND WHO ARE CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS COMPARED TO OTHERS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE INVESTED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR GREAT INITIATIVE. WHICH RESULTED IN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ADDITIONAL TENURE TRACK FACULTY. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTIONS ONE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC ADVISORS. AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STUDENT ACADEMIC SUPPORT PROGRAMS. SAID ANOTHER WAY JUST GOT NINETY THOUSAND MORE REAR ENDED SEATS DURING THAT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR. WE ANTICIPATED TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT YOU PROVIDED US. LAST YEAR FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WELL OUR CAMPUSES TO CONTINUE THESE TRENDS. THANKS TO THIS STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OF OF FUNDS IN AN UNWAVERING RELENTLESS FOCUS ON OUR INITIATIVE. SOME KEY CHANGES ARE EDUCATION POLICIES IN OUR OUR AMBITIOUS GOALS ARE ACTUALLY PROVING TO BE ATTAINABLE. IN THIS LAST JUNE IN OUR LAST MAJOR GRADUATION WE GRADUATED -- THE LARGEST NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY. OUR SYSTEM WHY GRADUATION RATES ARE ALSO AT ALL TIMES HIGHS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY. ARE FOR YOUR GREAT HAS INCREASED FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS BY SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS. A TWO YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUMPED BY 7% AND I THANK YOU LLOYD AND HIS COLLEAGUES FOR GIVING US SO WELL PREPARED STUDENTS. AND THE NUMBER OF BACHELOR'S DEGREES AWARDED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS ALSO A RECORD NUMBER ONE THOUSAND AND FIVE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE AT AN INCREASE OF SIX THOUSAND SO OVER LAST THE YEAR BEFORE. AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN DEGREES OVER THE YEAR BEFORE THAT. ME NEITHER STUNNING NUMBERS WHEN YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT IN WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT DEGREES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DEGREES WERE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT DREAMS. DREAMS FOR THE STUDENT IN YOUR FAMILY IN OUR COMMUNITY. EQUALLY IF NOT IMPORT MORE IMPORTANT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE EQUITY OUT. IN VERY SIGNIFICANT WAYS. IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE THE GAP -- FOR UNDERSERVED STUDENTS OF COLOR HAS SHRUNK BY NEARLY TWO FULL PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS IS A BIG LEFT IN A TO WORK IN PROGRESS -- WE HAVE A MUCH MORE TO DO BUT IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AFTER THIS RELENTLESS FOCUS -- LIMóN DECREASING THAT EQUITY GAP AT A TIME THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN ROLLING MORE MORE STUDENTS WHO COME FROM UNDERSERVED BACKGROUNDS AND OUR PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS. SO IT'S REALLY QUITE A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS INDEED HISTORIC PROGRESS THE MORE THAN ADDED MOMENTUM. MOMENTUM MADE BY OUR VERY SKILLED AND DEDICATED AND PASSIONATE FACULTY AND STAFF. THE HARD WORK OF OUR STUDENTS IN THE CAMPUS LEADERS ACADEMIC AND AND AND BUSINESS LEADERS ARE HELPING MAKE THIS HAPPEN. IT ALSO SHOWS A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT ON A DIVIDEND REALLY TO THE INVEST WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS MADE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. NO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WILL ALLOW THIS MOMENTUM TO BUILD. OF THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN RECURRING FUNDING HE IS PROPOSAL ALLOWS TO PROVIDE FAIR COMPENSATION TO ARE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND FACULTY AND STAFF WHO WORK AS I JUST SAID SO DILIGENTLY TO HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED. AND PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY LEARNING IN IN DISCOVERY ENVIRONMENT. IT'LL EXPAND ACCESS TO SERVER IN ADDITIONAL SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE PROVEN RESEARCH SUPPORTED EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES OF STUDENT SUCCESS THAT UNDERPIN OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE. IN THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR OUR CAPITAL NEEDS WILL HELP ENSURE THAT. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON A PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CLASSROOMS AND LABORATORIES. WE CAN DO MORE AND QUITE FRANKLY WE MUST DO MORE IN CALIFORNIA. A NEARLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL GRADS A DIVERSE GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YOUNG CALIFORNIANS. WAS SATISFIED THIS YEAR'S USE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SYSTEM WIDE WE HAVE THE PHYSICAL CAPACITY. IN HONEY IN ART TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES FOR AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND WE'RE THIS BUDGET TO INCLUDE THE INVESTMENT OF SEVENTY MILLION. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION REQUESTED FOR A GRAD INITIATIVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS FORTY FIVE MILLION TAKEN NOT. SEVENTY FIVE WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE COULD CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED A JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. CAL STATE UNIVERSITY REMAINS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ALL QUALIFY CALIFORNIANS THE OPPORTUNITIES MADE POSSIBLE BY HIGHER EDUCATION. IN ON A MASSIVE SCALE WOULD PROVIDE PEOPLE TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND FUTURE PROSPERITY. THE SCOPE OF OUR MISSION REQUIRES A ROBUST FINANCIAL COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REPRESENT JUST SUCH A COMMITMENT. AND WE FULLY SUPPORT HIS BUDGET RECOMMENDATION. BUT BE CLEAR WE ALSO STAND READY AND WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ADMIT EVEN FURTHER ADDITIONAL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR USED TO FULLY FUND OUR ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN GRADUATION INITIATIVE BUDGET REQUESTS. AND I DON'T WANT US TO LEAVE MY BY TWENTY THIRTY WERE LOOKING IN CALIFORNIA AT A DEGREE DROP US A MILLION DEGREES BACCALAUREATE DEGREES SHORT OF WHAT THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY WILL NEED. IN. TWENTY THIRTY IT AND IF WE IN OUR SHARED TO CSU IS HALF THAT NUMBER SO WE HAVE TO UP OUR GAME BY HAVING THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BASHERS DEGREES BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY MY QUESTION REALLY IS A POLICY QUESTION FOR YOU. SENATOR IS IF WE DON'T INVEST NOW IN A STRONG ECONOMY WE CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS CLARION CALL. A TO THE DETRIMENT OF CALIFORNIA INTO THE DECK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND IS OF BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION -- ARENA THIS YEAR GRATEFUL IS NOT A TERM WE HERE ON THIS BUILDING VERY OFTEN SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE ENROLLMENT INCREASE -- AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR SIXTY TWO MILLION AN INCREASE OF SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AND SEE ISSUE WHAT WHAT WERE YOUR PLANS FOR THE OR YOUR BOARDS PLAN WITH RESPECT -- TO ENROLLMENT INCREASES IN THE COST OF THAT MAYBE YOU MENTIONED AND I MISS MISS I DID MENTION IT SPECIFICALLY NUMERICALLY WE WE SOUGHT TO INCREASE OUR ROOMS BY IS PROPOSING 2%. SO IF WE WERE -- TO A BENEFIT BY OF FOR THIS THINKING IN CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT HE WOULD ADD. TO GO FROM ULD ABOUT NINETEEN A APPROPRIATIONS. OF FOR EVERYONE PERCENT WE HAD -- THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STE THE STUDENT FULL TIME STUDENT SAID FTS AND THAT WOULD TAKE IT FROM. SEVEN THOUSAND TO ABOUT A LITTLE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND YEAR THIS YEAR AND GO FROM SIXTY TWO MILLION TO NINETY MILLION TO GET YOU WHERE YOUR STRATEGIC PLAN SAYS YOU NEED TO BE IN ORDER TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF OF THE JOB MARKET IN THE FUTURE. IT WOULD IT WOULD ADD NINETY MILLION TO THE SIXTY TWO SO HAS NINETY MILLION YES IT'S A DISK IT'S FOR EVERYONE PERCENTAGE ROUGHLY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. THE FOOD WAS 4% IT WOULD YOU KNOW SO WHATEVER WE END UP BEING ABLE TO DO WERE. OUR FACULTY ARE PHYSICAL CAPACITIES READY WILLING AND ABLE TO DO THIS WE JUST NEED TO PERSONNEL THE FACULTY AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT FOLKS. TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER TO THAT -- TO THAT LEVEL SO SIXTY TWO MILLION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILLION VERSUS SIXTY TWO MILLION GIVE OR TAKE YES AND WE CAN GET PRECISE NUMBERS. TO TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF. NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. THE BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS FORTY FIVE MILLION IN YOUR STRATEGIC PLAN I GUESS TALKS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WHAT WHAT WOULD SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DO VERSUS THE FORTY FIVE MILLION. AND MAYBE YOU MENTION THAT MY MISTER APOLOGIZE TO THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS A WAY IN WHICH WE BUILD CAPACITY AGAIN BY MORE FACULTY ACADEMIC SUPPORT MORE COURSES. MORE EXTRACURRICULAR ACADEMIC EXPERIENCES IN LIKE -- SO WHEN WE MODEL WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN WE DID A VERY SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS OF EACH OF THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES HISTORY. AND CAPACITIES. WE WENT DISAGGREGATED THE DATA NEEDED BY CAMPUS BY CAMPUS. THE GOOD SAN LUIS OBISPO LOOKED AT STANFORD OR DEAL WITH THE SAN DIEGO XTERRA. AND THEN WE ADD INS CREATED STRETCH GOALS THAT WITH THE RIGHT LEVEL OF INVESTMENT. EVERYBODY AGREED COULD BE MET. SO WE'VE BEEN AGGREGATED THAT BACK UP AND THAT'S THE GRANT IS SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT MOVING FOR YOUR RATES FIVE YOUR RATING CENTER TO THE NUMBERS YOU KNOW ABOUT. BUT IT WAS ALSO A SIX YEAR INVESTMENT THAT EVERY YEAR OVER THE COURSE OF SIX YEARS WE WOULD INVEST SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN ORDER TO MEET THAT. AND SO WE'RE NOW -- SEEKING YEAR THREE OF THE SERIES OF INVESTMENTS TO TO REACH THAT GOAL. IF WE DON'T. GET SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE PROJECT. THEY'RE NOT AN ISSUE WILL BE DOWN REGULATED. IN A SORT OF SUCCESS THAT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT ON A GRADUATION RATES -- EQUITY GAPS WILL BE DIMINISH. YOU MEAN YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE DATED TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE -- I'M SURE SOMEONE CAN -- CAN PUT TOGETHER SOME DATA OF SOME IMPACT DATA. UNDER THE LEASE PROJECT IMPACTED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FORTY FIVE MILLION SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. INFORMATION TO HAVE SO. THAT THE FOLKS OF THE TO FOLKS AROUND HERE IN THE FOLKS DOWNSTAIRS CAN DO A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ON THAT INVESTMENT. YEAH THEY'RE TO BE CLEAR CONSEQUENCE ELEVEN YEARSTWO THINGS IN THE GRANT INITIATIVE TO COME TOGETHER. AND WE'LL WE'LL PUT AN ANALYSIS TOGETHER OF FOR YOU AND OTHERS. IT'S NOT ONLY FOR US TO DO OUR HEAVY LIFTING ON IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES. BUT IT'S ALSO BY GIVING MORE STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY WHO BENEFIT BY THAT EFFORT. TO THE MATHEMATICAL. RESULT OF DOING BETTER IN TERMS OF TIME TO DEGREE AND DEGREE COMPLETION. TIMES MORE STUDENTS AVAILING OF THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT LEADS TO THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS BY. TWENTY THIRTY THAT THE STATE NEEDS AND SO YOU KNOW WE COULD DO THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AN INCREASE OUR GRADUATION RATES. AS WERE DOING THE WILL HAVE MORE STUDENTS TO BENEFIT BY THAT WILL MISS THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO TREAT ACOMBINATION OF THE TWO AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE. OF PUT FORWARD A 5% REQUEST FOR ENROLLMENT AND WE PLAN TO DO THAT FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IN A ROW I ACTUALLY GREW THE UNIVERSITY OVER 20% UNDERSTAND IT'S AN INTEGRATED PROCESS HERE. IT IS AN INTEGRATED PROCESS THAT WITH WAS MAYBE YOU'VE TOUCHED ON THIS AS WELL I SEE THE BUDGET -- THE BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS A RATHER. SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN THE ISSUE. TO REVIEW A OF A POTENTIAL -- NEW CSU CAMPUS -- AND I I KNOW ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AS AN INTEREST IN. ANOTHER SEE ISSUE CAMPUS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE. INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WITHIN SEE ISSUE. CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT TO ME. TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE. OUR FACILITIES A COUPLE JUST GOOD SOUND BITES WE CAN GET YOU MUCH MORE DETAIL YOUR OFFICE MAY ALREADY HAVE IT. I THINK OF 60% OF OUR BUILDING INVENTORY IS THIRTY YEARS OR OLDER. AND I THINK SOMETHING LIKE 50% OR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD. IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO VISUALIZE HOW MANY BUILDINGS WE HAVE. IMAGINE A FOOTBALL FIELD. IMAGINE ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FOOTBALL FIELDS. THAT'S THE SIZE OF THE FACILITIES AT THE UNIVERSITY -- SO THE OLD AND THERE'S A LOT OF IT -- OUR STAFF UNDER EXECUTIVE ICE YET TO REALLY A AND VICE SAN JUAN. HAVE A BIG ANALYTICAL UP. MACHINE ROLE LOOKS AT THESE FACILITY NEEDS LOOKS AT THE USAGE OR AGE. ALL THE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. DION GLAMOUR STUFF OF EACH BACK IN. WATER IN GENERAL. SO WE HAVE A HUGE LIST OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF THINGS THAT NEED ATTENTION. AND IF YOU ADD UP THE DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THAT IN TODAY'S DOLLARS IT'S FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. FOR BUILDING A TO BE. AND SO WHEN WE WHEN WE MAKE REPLIED TO GET TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS THAT. WE HAVE A MUCH BIGGER HILL TO CLIMB HERE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO FOR A FOR ALL OF US POLICY ISSUE FOR THE STATE IS. THESE ARE ASSETS OF THE STATE IS INVESTED IN OVER. OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AND IF YOU LEAD A BUILDING GET TO SUCH A POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T RE HABIT IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE OF COURSE TO REBUILD THOSE BUILDINGS IT. EIGHT HUNDRED OR NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT. SO OF THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH RESPECT TO THINKING ABOUT A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND OR SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE. TO ACTUALLY TAKE ON THE FACILITY ISSUE BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS. A NEED DESERVES THE STATE EXPECTS US TO HAVE LEARNING AND DISCOVERY FACILITIES THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SOURCE TUNE TO LEARNING IN. IN IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT. SO -- ONE TIME FUNDING IT DID WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IS HELPFUL BUT THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE HERE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHERS ON TO FIND A SOLUTION TO WELL AS YOU KNOW THE CAR UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA BUDGET GOES UP AND DOWN. AND GENERAL FUND AVAILABILITY GOES UP AND DOWN HAS IS. ZERO THE STRIKE TEAM THAT'S BEEN FOR I'M SURE INSIDE YOUR ORGANIZATION YOU YOU STUDY THESE ISSUES AND DEBATE THEM AND TRY TO FIGURE THEM OUT BUT IS THERE. BEEN A LARGER STRIKE TEAM FORMED TO DISCUSS. HIGHER EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE HOW WE GET THE MONEY THAT WE NEED TO DO AND OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME IN ORDER TO FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY AT C. ISSUE BUT I'M SURE. YOU RECEIVE CALIFORNIA HAS THE SAME WELL LIT THE SECTORS HAVE BEEN WORKING AND TALKING TOGETHER NON PRESIDENT AWAYS FROM THIS ISSUE -- WERE OF THE THREE OF US ARE ALL PART OF A GROUP CALLED THE EDUCATION ROUNDTABLE THAT. CAME OUT OF THE GOVERNOR BROWN ADMINISTRATION WERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OF ALL THE THINGS CAN ALONG WITH. WITH THE TO PRINT AND THURMOND UP ALONG WITH ALL OF THE THINGS ARE CONFRONTING THE EDUCATION ECOSYSTEM AND FACILITIES. FOR THE UC AND CSU HE'LL HAVE -- NOT HAD A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND FOR EXAMPLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN THEN DIVERTING OPERATING FUNDS TO DEBT SERVICE. TO DO THE NECESSARY MAINTENANCE ON THE WORST OF THE WORST. THAT IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE PLAN FOR US UP. ONLY SUSTAINABLE FOOD IF WE DECREASE OUR ENROLLMENT AND STOP THIS GRADUATION IS WOULD TAKE CARE OF OUR BUILDINGS OPERATING FUNDS. SEEMS TO US THAT'S NOT IN THE BEST LONG TERM OR EVEN MEDIUM TERM INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY THE IDEA DISCUSSION WITH CENTER GLAZER WITH OTHERS WITH RESPECT TO A BOND IN THE NEAR FUTURE MAKES SENSE TO US THAT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THERE IS INTEREST BOTH POLITICAL AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONAL INTEREST IN DOING SOMETHING HAS ONCE HAVE YOU BEEN DISCUSSING THAT ISSUE WITH FIRST FOUR YES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHANCELLOR. I WANTED IF I MAY JUST. ONE I WISH. TO SENATOR MORALE WAS HERE YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT BUILDING CHARACTER WHEN WE WERE STUDENTS -- I WAS GOING TO COMMENT THAT HE WAS A CHARACTER BUT I DECIDED I BETTER NOT HE'S PROBABLY LISTENING TO USE. SO BACK IN THE DAY. HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. TO LIVE. IS A STUDENT. FIFTY DOLLARS A SEMESTER IN TUITION AND FEES CAL STATE. OF MY BOOKS I JUST ACTUALLY KEPT A COUPLE IN THERE MYMY SCIENCE BOOKS WERE. SEVEN NINETY FIVE HE HAVE OF FIVE BOOKS TO TERMS SO. AND IN GAS WAS TWENTY CENTS A GALLON. AND FOOD WELL FOOD AND BEER WAS THREE AND A BOTTOM. MR C. ADD UP -- ALL AT MONEY IN AND YOU SAY OKAY I GOT A JOB FOR TWENTY HOURS A WEEK IT'S THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. NINE HUNDRED BUCKS I WOULD PAY FOR WHAT I JUST SAID. YOU DO THE SAME MATH TODAY SAME TWENTY HOURS WORKING SAY IT'LL TEN OR ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. EVEN FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR WOULD YOU PLUG IN THE COSTS THAT I JUST DID. YOU'RE AT ABOUT THE 30% COVERAGE LEVEL. INTO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. TODAY'S WORLD AND THE WORLD IN WHICH YOU AND I GREW UP IN. SO THE THE TO THE NOTION OF THESE ADDED COSTS AND AND PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING HARD IS THIS REALLY SORT OF A METHOD. WE GET FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCES WHICH ARE NOT RELEVANT FOR THE MILLENNIALS TODAY ABSOLUTELY GAS WAS THIRTY FIVE CENTS A GALLON AND MY FOOD BUDGET IN LAW SCHOOL WAS FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH. NOT SO TODAY YOU'RE PRETTY YOUR YOUR OVER THE TOP AND YOU'RE LIVING THE HIGH LIFE. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU CANCER SIR THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- AGAIN I'M NOT A NATION BROS FROM THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH CANCERS WHITE IN OAKLEY -- TO DISCUSS HIGHER EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY THE BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

ARE KEEPING YOU SEE AFFORDABLE FOR OUR STUDENTS WHILE UPHOLDING THE PROMISE OF A QUALITY EDUCATION REQUIRES A PARTNERSHIP IN STATE INVESTMENT -- I DO WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT HOLDING TUITION FLAT. MEANS THAT YOU SEE HAS LESS INSTITUTIONAL AID TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS FOR THEIR LIVING EXPENSES AS CANCER WHY JUST ARTICULTED. CURRENTLY WE TAKE A ONE THIRD OF OUR TUITION REVENUE AND WE RETURN IT AS H. R. NEEDIEST STUDENTS. AND THIS AMOUNT IS NOT GROWING. AND THIS EIGHT PRIMARILY COVERS COSTS ABOVE AND BEYOND TUITION INCLUDING THE RISING COSTS FOR HOUSING. FOOD TRANSPORTATION AND AND SUPPLIES. I JOIN OUR MOST RECENT ACADEMIC YEAR A 57% OF ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES RECEIVE GRANT OR SCHOLARSHIP ASSISTANCE OF FULLY COVERED. THEIR TUITION AND MANDATORY SYSTEM WIDE AYE AYE CHARGES SO THIS SUB -- EXTRA MONEY IS USED TO SUPPORT THOSE I TUITION. HOLDEN TWITTER FLAT FOR THIS MANY YEARS HAS ALSO PRESENTED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO OUR TO OUR CAMPUSES. I SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE TUITION YOU SEE HAS INCREASED BY ONLY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT -- WHILE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRICE INDEX IS IT HAS INCREASED SO WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT YOU SEE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN SUCCEED. THIS MEANS EITHER COMMITTING TO MODERATE -- PREDICTABLE TUITION INCREASES OR COMMENSURATE AMOUNT OF ON GOING STATE FUNDING WITH ROBUST FINANCIAL AID. TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU AN EFFORT WE HAVE BEEN UNDER HAD UNDER WAY TO DEVELOP OUR VISION FOR WHAT YOU SEE -- COULD BE AND SHOULD BE IN THE FUTURE INFORMED BOTH BY THE STATE'S NEEDS AND OUR ROLE IN FULFILLING THOSE NEEDS AND STRATEGIES FOR REALIZING THAT THAT VISION. ALONG WITH OUR CHANCELLORS AND IN CONSULTATION WITH A BOARD OF REGENTS WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING A MULTI YEAR FRAMEWORK WHICH LAYS OUT A VISION WHERE WE COULD INCREASE DEGREES BY OVER. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT ONE MILLION THAT WE ALREADY FORECAST WE ALSO WORK TO REDUCE THE TIME IT TAKES A SOON TO GRADUATE. AND THEN BOTH GROW AND DIVERSIFY OUR PROFESSORIAL TO BETTER REFLECT THE POPULATION WE SERVE AND ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN. IN GRADUATION RATES. WE BEGUN TO SHARE A MULTI YEAR PLAN WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION. FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND WE'RE EAGER TO RECEIVE YOUR YOUR FEEDBACK. A CENTRAL THAT PLAN IS A DESIRE TO PIVOT FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUDGETING AND PLANNING TO ONE THAT IS AIMED AT LONG TERM PLANNING ACHIEVING BOLD ASPIRATIONAL GOALS. WE ALSO WANT TO MOVE FROM A FOCUS PURELY ON ENROLLMENT TO VISION MORE INFORMED BY OUTCOMES. WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO HELP OUR STUDENTS GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER ESPECIALLY CONTINUE TO CLOSE GRADUATION GAPS IN TIME TO DEGREE GAPS FOR LOW INCOME AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO DO OUR PART IN MAKING THIS DREAM A REALITY FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. A BOLD VISION THE GOAL IS TO TAKE RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ARE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OR DEDUCTION PROVIDED YOU SEE WITH TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW ON GOING FUNDING. THIS IS SIX POINT 9% BASED BUDGET INCREASE MORE THAN ANY OF THE JANUARY BUDGET INTRODUCTIONS. THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO YOU SEE IN RECENT YEARS. WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH HIS INTRODUCTION REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE THESE FUNDS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN ARE YOU SEE HAS ADDED MORE THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES GREATLY EXCEEDING OUR INITIAL TARGET OF TEN THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS BY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THROUGH THIS ENROLLMENT GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE A NUMBER OF HISTORICALLY REPRESENTED AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. REYES WHO KNOWS YOU SEE STUDENTS ARE ROLLED FROM MORE THAN ONE YEAR AND OUR CAMPUSES NEED ONGOING FUNDS TO SUPPORT THEM AND THE NEXT CLASS OF STUDENTS TO REPLACE THEM. TO THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION. TO SUPPORT THIS INCREASE ENROLLMENT BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS WE ARE REQUESTING A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THAT'S YOUR STATE BUDGET THIS SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE APPROVED PERMANENT FUNDS FOR UC. THESE FUNDS WERE PROVIDED INSTEAD OF A TUITION INCREASE AND TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL STUDENTS ARE WE HAD ALREADY ENROLLED. THIS ALLOWED US AGAIN NOT TO ENCRYPT INCREASED TUITION THIS ACADEMIC YEAR. BUT ULTIMATELY THE FINAL BUDGET BILL PROVIDED YOU SEE -- WITH NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME MONEY. THIS ONE TIME MONEY WILL GO AWAY IN TWENTY NINE AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INTRODUCTION DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDS REPLACE THIS AMOUNT. BUT SIMPLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST IS THAT THIS FUNDING BE CONVERTED FROM ONE TIME FUNDS TO PERMANENT FUNDS. JUST AS TUITION WOULD HAVE BEEN A PERMANENT REVENUE SOURCE. DOING THIS IS CRITICAL TO SUSTAINING UC'S INVESTMENTS IN INSTRUCTORS TEACHING ASSISTANTS GRADUATE STUDENTS AND CAMPUS BASED PROGRAMS. WITHOUT THESE FUNDS ARE STUDENTS MAY NOT GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE OTHER HALF OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION WITH SUPPORT ADDITIONAL AND ROAMING GROWTH OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. AND A THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE FACULTY AND STAFF REQUIRED TO SUPPORT PREVIOUS ENROLLMENT GROWTH EXCEEDED BUDGET AMOUNTS. AS WELL AS DEBT SERVICE TO SUPPORT OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. I'M NOT HERE TO SIMPLY ASK FOR MORE FUNDING I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE OUR PROGRESS IN BOTH REVENUE GENERATION AND AND COST CONTAINMENT AS WELL. WE'VE DONE A LOT IN RECENT YEARS TO BOTH REDUCE OUR COSTS AND GENERATE SIGNIFICANT ALTERNATIVE REVENUE. WE HAVE A A PROCUREMENT A PROCESS UNDER WAY THAT SAVING THE UNIVERSITY WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. I WE ACTUALLY WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH CAL STATE IN A PROGRAM KNOWN AS CAL YOU SOURCE -- TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE OUR SELF INSURANCE PROGRAM CALLED THAT IS NOW SAVING ROUGHLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND LOWERING THE COST OF OUR ON GOING INSURANCE. AGAIN WE ALSO COLLABORATING WITH THAT WAS CSU ON THIS -- CAPTIVE INSURANCE PROGRAM. WELL WE ENDED FINANCIAL AID FOR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT'S LED TO FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SAVINGS. AND WE IMPLEMENTED ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE YIELDED A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS IN COST SAVINGS. AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AND WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COLLEAGUES FOR NEW WAYS TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS INCREASE EFFICIENCIES. IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK YOU% AND ASK YOUR PARTNERSHIP AS WE SUSTAIN AND GROW THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. FOR THIS GENERATION OF STUDENTS AND GENERATIONS TO COME. THANK YOU SIR LET ME JUST TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THE BUDGET ITEMS -- HE MENTIONED ENROLLMENT SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CURRENTLY PROPOSES TEN MILLION FOR AN ADDITIONAL THOUSAND STUDENTS AS I READ IT. YOU'VE INDICATED THAT IF YOU ADD NINETY MILLION ROUGHLY TO THAT. YOU CAN ADD AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS. COULD OUT AND NO LET ME LET ME BREAK THAT OUT BECAUSE IT IS CONFUSING SO THE TEN MILLION IT'S PUT IN OUR FOR EXISTING STUDENTS -- FOR OVER IN ROME AT THAT WE HAD IN PRIOR -- BUDGET YEARS -- WHAT WE ARE SEEKING -- THIS YEAR WOULD DOLLARS FOR OUR THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE -- TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES IN A THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS THE THE REMAINING OF THAT THE REMAINDER OF THAT -- UP TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IS -- FOR ENROLLMENT OVER ENROLLMENT THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE NINETEEN HUNDRED MORE STUDENTS AND WE HAD BUDGETED. FOR IN THIS CURRENT YEAR IT'S ALSO FOR FINDING THE PRIME PROGRAMWHICH I THINK ARE YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR MEDICAL STUDENTS THAT ARE WORKING IN. UNDERSERVED IN LARGELY RURAL AREAS IN IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS IT PRESENTLY STANDS DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY MONEY FOR ADDITIONAL STUDENTS FOR NEW ENROLLMENT IT DOES NOT OKAY AND SO YOU'RE REQUESTING FORTY THREE MILLION FOR THE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT'S CORRECT [inaudible] NOW. WITH A BY THE WAY I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES THE FORTY MILLION. IN ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THE PROP FIFTY SIX MEDIC MEDICAL RESIDENCY PROGRAM SO WE DON'T HAVE. TO THANK YOU GOVERNOR WE DON'T KNOW WE WERE VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT AS WELL WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT. NOW ARMED CONFLICT AGAIN. WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A FIVE POINT THREE MILLION AS I UNDERSTAND IT ON GOING TO HER SOME ADDITIONAL. CLINICIANS. WAS THAT A BCP FROM UNIVERSITY. THIS WAS. OUR REGION SAID VOTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO COMMIT -- SERVICES FEES THESE ARE FEES ABOVE AND BEYOND TUITION -- AND THEY HAD APPROVED 5% INCREASES EVERY YEAR TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OF THAT -- WAS ALWAYS SLATED TO GO -- FOR FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND ACTUALLY SEVERAL OUR CAMPUSES HAD BORROWED AHEAD OF TIME BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS -- ON OUR CAMPUSES AS I'M SURE CANCERS WHITE NO QUICK AND ALSO -- TEST BECAUSE WE HAD PUT IN I NOT TO RAISE EITHER TUITION OR THE STUDENT SERVICES FEE THIS WAS PUT INTO AYE TO MEET THAT -- EXPENDITURE -- AT OUR CAMPUSES AND IS FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEED FOR CLINICIANS WHAT WHAT. TWO PART QUESTION ONE AND WHAT DOES YOUR STUDY SUGGESTS -- IN OUR STUDY SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS A OVERWHELMING NEED FOR A MENTAL HEALTH I THINK UCLA ALONE I'M THAT -- ONE OF THE CO CHAIRS OF OUR SOON HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM UCLA HAS SAID THAT THEY ARE GETTING ROUGHLY. TWICE AS MANY REQUESTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH -- A WE HAD A LIKE A FIVE YEAR PROGRAM TO BUILD UP THOSE RESOURCES I TO MEET THOSE NEEDS YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD NOTED THE SAME TIME WE HAVE BEEN ADDING ENROLLMENT SO -- YOU KNOW WHETHER THOSE ARE SUFFICIENT -- I CAN'T SAY BUT WE IN WE WE DO PUT OUT A REPORT THAT I WILL pMENTAL HEALTH. WELL I THINK IT PROBABLY GOES WITHOUT SAYING OF THE MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS THAT AT ALL LEVELS A FEW. TWELVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE ISSUE AND YOU SEE -- IS A VITAL WAS OF VITAL CONCERN TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THIS BUILDING SO. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN RECEIVING ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU WILL HAVE BOTH THE TO SEE ISSUE AND YOU SEE AND FRANKLY. YOU -- TO CHESSER OAKLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AS TO WHETHER THE FUNDING IS SUFFICIENT -- I WOULD NOT CENTER OFF THE DEBT THE GOVERNOR ALSO DID DID PUT IN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR BASIC NEEDS. AND WHILE WE DO WE HAVE CRITICAL NEEDS -- FOR THE FOOD INSECURITY IN HOUSING IT SECURITY WHICH WE WILL BE USING THESE FUNDS TO MEET THE STUDENT COMMITTEES THAT PUT THIS TOGETHER ALSO INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH AS A BASIC NEED AND SO. AS THIS IS ONGOING FUNDING YOU KNOW IN THE THIS COULD ALSO BE RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PERFECT. LET ME SEGUE INTO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND FACILITY NEEDS TO USE THE ACTION THAT I BELIEVE THAT IT COULD YOU GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL THE BUDGET CURRENTLY PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. WHAT'S THE NEED. SO THAT IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ADS YEAH I KNOW YOU'RE GRATEFUL -- TO IT WE HAVE A PROGRAM UNDER WAY THAT IS TRYING TO STANDARDIZE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES -- IT'S CALLED AYE CAMP -- AND IT IS IT LOOKS AT AS IS CHANCE WHITE WAS SAYING -- THE AGE OF THE BUILDINGS WHAT INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE THE TYPES OF SYSTEMS THEY HAVE -- YOU KNOW THE EQUIVALENT CONTINUES OCCUPANCY OF THOSE BUILDINGS AND TRYING TO GET BOTH A OVERALL NUMBER. BUT ALSO A A PRIORITIZATION HARDLY TRIAGE -- HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND THAT TO GIVE US MORE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE'RE NOT FINISHED WITH THAT BUT IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THE NEED FOR STATE ELIGIBLE BILLINGS IS ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS -- WE HAVE A SIMILAR AMOUNT FOR NON STATE ELIGIBLE BUT WE HAVE OTHER REVENUE SOURCES YOU KNOW HOUSING REVENUES MEDICAL CENTER -- REVENUES OTHER AUXILIARY REVENUES TO HELP SUPPORT THAT SO -- WE YOU KNOW I I I SHARE -- CHANCE OR WITH -- WHITE VIEW THAT -- THESE -- ONE TIME FUNDS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO US BUT WE ALSO TO GET AHEAD OF THE THE ISSUE -- WOULD BE LOOKING FOR A GEO BOND ON THE BALLOT AND THAT'S NOT JUST TO SERVE -- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT ALSO -- WE ALSO DOING NEW SEISMIC STUDIES ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING CODES WE DO NEED O UPGRADE -- A LOT OF THOSE BUILDINGS AS WELL SO THE NON STATE OWNED OF FACILITIES THE MEDICAL CENTERS I ASSUME THEY HAVE A REVENUE STREAM THAT. CAN SUPPORT -- AS AS MANY OF OUR AUXILIARIES IN SUMMER RESEARCH THAT YOU KNOW IS SUPPORTED BY INDIRECT COST RECOVERY NOT STATE FUNDS BUT THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS A FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION ON THE STATE OWNED EXACTLY. WESLEY -- THE TUITION INCREASE IN OR NO TUITION INCREASE THAT'S FOR IN STATE STUDENTS THAT'S IN STATE. SO. I ASSUME THAT WITH RESPECT OUT OF STATE STUDENTS. TUITION INCREASE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED WE HAVE A ON THE MARCH A BALLOT WE HAVE A TUITION INCREASE FOR NON RESIDENTS UP WILL TUITION. THAT'S A PEGGED AT INFLATION A TWO POINT 6% -- INCREASE. ON THE MARCH A MARCH REGIONS -- GENDER YEAH I'M SORRY IN THE BALLOT. SO. THAT DOES CREATE SOME FUNDING DISPARITY AMONG THE CAMPUSES CORRECT GIVEN THE PERCENTAGES OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTSTHAT SOME HAVE VERSUS THE PERCENTAGES THAT OTHER CAMPUSES HAVE. THAT IS CORRECT YEAH NON RESIDENT TUITION STAYS ON THE CAMPUS WHERE IT'S GENERATED IS THERE ANY. IS THERE ANY THOUGHT TO REVISIT THE WAY THAT MONEY IS ALLOCATED -- TO DEAL WITH THOSE CAMPUSES THAT DON'T -- AREN'T ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM WHATEVER IT IS 20% -- THE STATE'S STUDENT ENROLLMENT YEAH WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT -- DIFFERENT AND AS SOON JUST NOT TO INTERRUPT I JUST DID -- BUT TO I SING THAT REALLY RELATES -- TO YOU KNOW YOU SEE MERCED PERHAPS. MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE IN THERE SOMEWHERE. YEAH ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT IT NOW -- YOU KNOW WE DOCTORED THE CAP ON ANDREAS ENROLLMENT AT 18% TWO YEARS AO THERE ARE FOUR CAMPUSES IRVINE SAN DIEGO -- BURKE IN UCLA THAT WERE ABOVE THAT CAPS OR IN THE LOW -- CAP. ARE THE OTHER THREE THAT YOU WOULD MENTION ARE ARE BELOW ARE THERE FOR SANTA BARBARA IS HER MID TEENS AND THEN THE OTHER THREE ARE -- IN SINGLE DIGITS WITH MERCED AT BASICALLY AT AT ZERO EITHER A LOT OF DISPARITIES IN IN -- NONTRADITIONAL -- REVENUES -- AT OUR CAMPUS IS IT'S NOT JUST NON RESIDENT TUITION ITS PATENT REVENUES IT'S INDIRECT COSTS REVENUES FROM RESEARCH IT IS -- MED CENTER REVENUES -- AT A DIFFERENT INSTITUTION AND I I WORKED ON A EFFORT TO TRY TO NORMALIZE THAT FUNDING WAS CALLED RE BENCHING. EIGHT YEARS AGO OR SEVEN YEARS AGO. YEAH -- BUT I IT BY DOT YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS TIME TO REVISIT THAT GIVEN YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF GROWTH IN THOSE OTHER REVENUE SOURCES. AND YOU KNOW AND KEPT WISHIN FLAT SO CAMPUS LIKE RIVERSIDE IS MORE TUITION DEPENDENT THAN ALMOST ANY CAMPUS WE HAVE. AND I WAS JUST I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE PRESSURE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. TO KEEP. IN STATE TUITION FLAT. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE REASONS. FOR BUT THE THEN THAT CREATES THIS FUNDING DISPARITY. THAT IN SOME WAYS AND SOMETIMES IN SOME CASES THE STATE CAN'T SIMPLY MAKE UP. TO THESE CAMPUSES THROUGH AN INCREASE OF THE GENERAL FUND AND THERE YOU ALL REALLY ON A TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND SEE IF AS A POLICY MATTER THAT IS APPROPRIATE NOW. HOW DOES RETURN I I THINK AS A POLICY MATTER I MEAN I WOULD JUST REMIND THE COMMITTEE? YOUR 57% OF OUR STUDENTS PAY NO TUITION. AND TUITION IS A PRIME WHAT WE CALL RETURNED EIGHT THROUGH WE KEEP TUITION FLAT THAT BASIC THE KEEPS THE FINANCIAL AID POOL FLAT. FOR ALL THE OTHER -- NON TUITION -- COST YOU KNOW AS AS CHANCER SO CLEAN WHITE NOTED THE COST OF HOUSING THE COST OF BOOKS ACOSTA FOOD. AND SO YOU KNOW IN ESSENCE -- OUR FINANCIAL AID -- POOL IS GOING DOWN WE WHEN WE DO THAT AND WE THINK UP. YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF JEWISH AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE GO THROUGH LONG PERIODS OF KEEPING IT FLAT AND IT'S DOUBLE DIGIT AND WE THINK A A BETTER POLICY APPROACH WOULD BE HAVING A YOU KNOW -- INFLATION BASED MODERATE TUITION WHERE YOU KEPT. THE REAL COST OF EDUCATION FLAT BUT JUST GREW UP WITH INFLATION WELL I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT AND YOU KNOW WE FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURES FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHEN YOU WORK IN THE SPELLING OF AND ALL I'M ASKING WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR POINT IS PERHAPS. THE REGION'S COULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN WE'RE CERTAIN PIECE OF THE STUDENT POPULATION. YES SUBJECT TO A FEE INCREASE IN. THE RESTAURANT NOT AND YOU HAVE THESE WIDE DISPARITIES AMONG TWO CAMPUSES AS TO HOW MANY OTHER STATES STUDENTS. THEY HAVE AN OLDER OR ARE ABLE TO ENROLL -- ANYWAY QUESTIONS THE RIVER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT NOT REALLY A QUESTION MORE OF AN IDEA -- SO IT SEEMS THE CROSS ALL OF OUR OUR CAMPUSES FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY IS A PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW TO MY-COLLEAGUES POINT THAT YOU KNOW I I ALSO WORK FULL TIME WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYONE -- AND I ALSO LIVED AT HOME I WASN'T SUPPORTING MYSELF IT WAS MUCH DIFFERENT. SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT BUT I ALSO -- ONE I WANT TO SHOUT OUT TO THE GOVERNOR SO MUCH APPRECIATE THAT HE PUT THE MONEY AND BEFORE WE HAD A REALLY LOBBY HIM HARD WHICH IS PRETTY AWESOME SHE DOES FEEL THE SAME WAY. BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE US TO THINK ABOUT -- AFTER THIS MY FIFTH YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE AFTER ABOUT COUPLE YEARS I SAID TO MY STAFF I SAID HOW COME THE C. ISSUES COME EVERY YEAR AND ASK US FOR MONEY. WHY HAVEN'T WE FIGURED OUT A FUNDING STREAM FOR THEM YET? SO I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY NEED TO DO SO I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS PLAN YOUR BUDGET WONDERING EVERY YEAR WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE -- WHEN I WAS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND WE NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS EVEN THE EMPLOYERS WHO DIDN'T LOVE BEING UNDER UNION CONTRACTS SAID WE APPRECIATE KNOWING THREE OR FOUR YEARS WHAT OUR COSTS ARE GOING TO BE? SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THROW OUT THERE WE AS A COMMITTEE AND AS THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW DO WE FIND. FUNDING OR MAYBE EVEN A FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS OUT SO THAT YOU GUYS COMPLAINED BETTER SOME I'M JUST GONNA THROW THAT UP FOR CONSIDERATION I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU BEING HERE AND WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY AS WELL. WE WOULD WELCOME. A MULTI YEAR APPROACH FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. THE NOTION OF WHEN I RAIN CAMPUSES. YOU SEE AN AN IN OTHER PLACES IN THE COUNTRY. IF YOU CAN BE MUCH WISER USERS OF THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE. IF THEY ARE PREDICTABLE. SUSTAINABLE AND HOPEFULLY SUFFICIENT. THIS LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW WE STARTED IN PRETTY DEEP HOLE IN THIS BUILDING WAS THE GOVERNOR BROWN'S NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR US AGAINST OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SOMETHING ASK. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE BILL WAS SIGNED IN JUNE WHEN WE'VE MADE PROGRESS AGAINST THAT INITIAL INTRODUCTORY BUDGET. WAS LIKE WE'D ALREADY MADE ALL THE ADMISSIONS DECISIONS WITH THE EXPECTATION OF OF ACTUALLY HAVING A BUDGET CUTS. AND IN AN OFFICE AND YOU GET THIS BOWLS OF MONEY PERMANENT MONEY AND YOU GO OH CRAP. WITH ALL THE STUDENTS NOW COMING. IN SO WE HUSTLE OUT THERE AND WE FIND VERY CAPABLE THE TEMPORARY FACULTY TO CREATE A CURRICULUM. IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE IF YOU KNEW THAT YOU COULD CLOTHING HIGHER THE PERMIT PROFESSORIAL FACULTY. KNOWING THE STUDENTS ARE COMING BECAUSE OUR DATA ANALYTICS WE KNOW WHAT'S COMING. AND IT WOULD BE SO FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE GET WE CAN SPEND A MUCH MORE WISELY. AND HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE. I KNOW IT'S TRUE FOR THE UC IN FOR THE COMMUNICABLE HIS A WEEK WE WOULD WELCOME A MULTI YEAR DISCUSSION [inaudible] RIGHT. I AGREE AND THAT'S SOMETHING I HOPE WE CAN WORK ON GOING FORWARD. GIVEN THE WIDE SWING WILD SWINGS IN WIDE SWINGS IN THE CALIFORNIA REVENUE STREAM IN OUR BUDGET WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THAT WORKS -- I SUPPOSE IN IN PERIODS OF A RUN UP WHERE YOU CAN EXPECT TO YOU KNOW SIX OR SEVEN YEAR RUN UP IN THE ECONOMY WE IT WOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO PEG THAT NUMBER BUT ON WHEN WE'RE ON THE DOWNWARD SLIDE I DON'T I DON'T. RIGHT HOW TO PICK THE NUMBER PERHAPS THERE'SSOME RESERVE ACCOUNT THAT COULD BE USED TO BALANCE OUT THE REVENUE FLOW. THAT WE DON'T GET TO HAVE EXPERIENCES BUDGETEERS BUT THAT YOU ALL COULD THEN BENEFIT FROM WITH A MULTI YEAR BUDGET. SMARTER PEOPLE THAN I AM I'M SURE CAN FIGURE WE'VE EXPLORE THAT A LITTLE BIT I CENTER OFF BECAUSE WE DO HAVE -- SOME RESERVISTS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OUR MEDICAL CENTERS YOU KNOW IF THERE WERE A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE HAD TO MAKE A CUT I MEAN THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS TO PUT THAT ON THE BACKS OF STUDENTS. AND SO IF IF THERE WAS A WAY THAT YOU CAN BRING THIS STATE TO MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT. AND THEN -- IF YOU KNOW THE PAID OFF OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS I THINK THAT WOULD SMOOTH OUT. YOU KNOW THE THE VOLATILITY THAT WE SEE IN -- IN IN IN THE STATE REVENUES BUT AGAIN WELL TO YOUR PLANNING IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR US AND ESPECIALLY TRY TO MEET THESE GOALS OF A MILLION MORE STUDENTS BY MILLION MORE DEGREES BY TWENTY THIRTY WE HAVE TO GIVE A CHANCE OR WHITES MEDICAL CENTERS THOUGH BUT THAT'S OKAY WE'LL. WORK ON THAT. WELL WHEN THE MONEY AT LEGISLATOR RATES FUNDAMENTAL PARADIGM SHIFT TO THE FIRST DOLLARS OFF THE STATE BUDGET -- FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN AND WHEN THERE'S A DOWNTURN OTHER PEOPLE SUFFER. WE WERE TO SEE CORMORANTS. WELL WE'LL GO TO WORK ON THAT GENTLEMAN. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR EXTRAORDINARY PATIENCE AND I WON'T HAVE TO ORDER DINNER CANCER WAY.

THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALLOCATES TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CSU TO HELP ADDRESSES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. AND EXPAND ON CAMPUS CHILD CARE CENTRES.

A ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR -- ALL ONE TIME -- SUPPORT FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME TO SUPPORT A TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND TO GREET FOR COMPLETION PROGRAMS THAT USE EXTENSION CENTERS. THIS INVESTMENT IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES LARGER THAN WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN LAST YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE UC TO EXPAND A PILOT DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS EXPANSE OF DIFFICULT PROGRAMS EXTENSION CENTERS. ALTHOUGH THESE OUT YOUR COMMITMENTS DO NOT APPEAR IN THE BUDGET BILL. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED ONE POINT THREE MILLION ONLINE GENERAL FUND FOR IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES BEGINNING IN -- TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ONE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS OF ONGOING SUPPORT -- BUT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AID PROPOSALS THAT'LL HELP SOON PARENTS NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTS APPROXIMATELY FOUR NINETY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS. WE'LL SEE NEARLY TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF AID IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE CALDERON PROGRAM THE STATE'S LARGEST FINANCIALLY PROGRAM. IS EXPECTED TO SERVE ABOUT FOUR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS TO PROVIDE MORE THAN TWO POINT FOUR BILLION IN AID. SPECIFICALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND. TO INCREASE OUR PROVIDE ACCESS WORDS TO STERN PARENTS.

CAL GRANT SEE STUDENTS WILL SEE THE BROKEN SUPPLIES GRANT INCREASE FROM 1-009-410-0090 FOUR DOLLARS TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE BUDGET ALSO FRIENDS IS NINE POINT SIX MILLION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NEW COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS BY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THIRTY THOUSAND COMPARE OF CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS ARE OFTEN NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS WHO ARE. WHO ARE OLDER FROM LA LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND FACE THREE SPEAKERS TO COMPLETION? INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS IMPROVES COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY FOR STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED WEATHER WISE WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT AWARD. WITH THAT WILL CLOSE AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. WELL FINANCES AMID SAY YOU GREAT PRESENTATION AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS BUDGET. IT'S ROBUST AND WORK NEEDS TO BE. YOU KNOW YOU HEARD THE THE V. YOU SEE IN THE C. ISSUE PRESENTATION WITH RESPECT. TO THE DESIRE FOR SOME MULTI YEAR. LEVEL OF CERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR FINANCING AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW FISCAL SEARCH CERTAINTY FOR STUDENTS. PROBABLY DEPENDS ON FISCAL CERTAINTY FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER. EDUCATION TO SOME EXTENT AND WHETHER IT'S THROUGH A HIGHER EDUCATION RESERVE ACCOUNT OR OR SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN. SORT OF LEVEL OUT THE THE BUDGETING PROCESS FOR YOU SEE AND SEE ISSUES SO THERE'S SOME PREDICTABILITY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY ADMIT STUDENTS AND IT'S NOT A ONE OFF THING IT'S A ONE YEAR TWO YEARS THREE OR FOUR YEAR TO GET OUT OR FIVE OR SIX TO GET. OUT WITH A DEGREE SO. SOME CERTAINTY IN THE LEVEL OF FUNDING WOULD PROBABLY HELP BUT GREAT JOB. HELLO. I'M SAYING SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU OVERVIEW OF EDUCATION PROPOSALS THE FIRST FOUR PAGES ARE LARGELY THERE FOR YOUR REFERENCE THERE'S JUST GOING TO HIGHLIGHT. A COUPLE OF THINGS ON EACH PAGE SO THE FIRST PAGES ALL THE EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSALS YOU FOR QUITE A BIT ABOUT. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT 75% OF ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION IN NEW EARLY ON SPENDING THIS FOR ONE TIME INITIATIVES. THE THOUGHT OF QUARTERS FOR NEW ONGOING SPENDING SOME OF THAT NEW ON GOING SPENDING AS ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH IN COSTS FROM PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED POLICIES. PAGE TWO IS ALL THE NINETY EIGHT PROPOSALS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TWO POINT NINE BILLION VIRTUALLY ALL OF THIS IS ONGOING. BUT IS SIGNIFICANT OUR TURN TO IT ALL MEANT. PAGE THREE IS ALL THE HIGHER% EDUCATION PROPOSALS BOTH NINETY EIGHT AND NINE NINETY EIGHT ABOUT 30% SO THOUGHT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION LISTED AS ONE TIME. THE REMAINING IS ONGOING SO THE FIRST THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE IS JUST THE ARCHITECTURE OF YOUR BUDGET SO HE'S GOT TWO POINT NINE BILLION AN ON GOING NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. HE HAS TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION AND NON NINETY EIGHT FOR ALL OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET. OF THAT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION AND NINE NINETY EIGHT SPENDING ABOUT A BILLION IS IN THE EDUCATION AREA. SO OF THAT BILLION ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AS FOR MORE UNIVERSITY AND AIDS FUNDING IN ABOUT THREE INTERN FIFTY MILLION IS FOR EARLY EDUCATION THE NUMBER I JUST HEARD ON A FEW PAGES AGO. SO THOSE ARE THE FIRST ORDER DECISIONS FOR YOU AS WE WENT THROUGH OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE IDENTIFIED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SOME MILLION AN ON GOING NINE NINETY EIGHT SPENDING THAT WE THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO RESET THAT. AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED SOME MILLION AND ONE TIMES FUNDING SO WE THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO IMPROVE THE BUDGET MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT PUT YOUR STAMP ON IT. A HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE IN A MOMENT. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE GENERAL FUND SPENDING YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ALSO THIS MORNING ABOUT BOND FUNDED ACTIVITIES SO PAGE. FOR IS ALL OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. THOSE PROJECTS ARE TYPICALLY RUN THROUGH THE BUDGET CYCLE HE TWELVE PROJECTS AREN'T LISTED HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T PUT THEM THROUGH THE BUDGET BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE AND A HALF BILLION IN PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FUNDING FOR K.. TWELVE YOU CAN SEE SOME DIFFERENCES IN APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE ADMINISTRATION IS JUST FUNDING PLAN THEIR PLANS AND WORKING DRAWINGS THAT'S THE TRADITIONAL STATE APPROACHES TO DISCO PROJECT PHASE BY PHASE. FOR THE GET CSU ALL PHASES ARE BEING OF FINANCE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND FOR YOU SEE IT'S JUST THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THEIR PROJECTS. BECAUSE I WAS CONVERSATION EARLIER THIS MORNING I JUST STOP FOR A MOMENT IF THERE IS GOING TO BE CONVERSATION OF THE NEW BONDS THAT WOULD INCLUDE HE UNIVERSITY IS -- JUST AS A HISTORICAL REVIEW BACK IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FOR YOU SEE AND BACK AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN FOR CSU THE STATE MADE A DECISION AT THAT TIME. TO TAKE THE STATE THAT SERVICE AMOUNT ROLL IT INTO THE UNIVERSITY'S MAIN SUPPORT ITEM SUCH THAT THEY WOULD HAVE -- A BETTER CONVERSATION WAS THE THEORY ABOUT THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN THEIR CAPITAL AND SUPPORT BUDGETS SO IF YOU WERE TO WANT TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH ME FORWARD YOU MIGHT WANT TO REVISIT HOW MUCH OF THEIR EXISTING BUDGET IS GOING FOR DOT SERVICE. AT LEAST HAVE THAT AS ONE OF YOUR CONSIDERATIONS. SO THE REST OF THE HAND OUT IS OUR ANALYSIS OF THE BUDGET SO PAGE FIVE IS -- HIGHLIGHTING A FEW THINGS THAT YOU'LL HEAR MORE DEEPLY ABOUT IN THE EARLY ADDS DR. THE LARGEST OF THE GOVERNOR'S ONE TIME PROPOSED BROWN'S TRYING TO PROMOTE MORE FULL DAY PROGRAMS IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE STATE STARTED THIS YEAR. SO WE WENT AND WE LOOKED AT THE FIRST ROUND APPLICATIONS FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION THE STATE PROVIDED THIS YEAR. AND DISCOVERED THAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF IT IS GOING TO DISTRICTS WHO ALREADY RUN ONLY FULL DAY PROGRAMS. SO WE THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO REVISIT THE PROPOSAL YOU COULD USE IT FOR HIGHER RESERVES YOU COULD USE THAT FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PENSION PAYMENT. IF YOU DID ON THE LAST ONE TO DO SOMETHING IN IN THIS AREA WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU CREATE A FAR MORE TARGETED PROGRAM SO WHERE AS MOST OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MONEY IS GOING TO DISTRICTS THAT ALREADY RUN FULL DAY PROGRAMS. YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT A MUCH MORE TARGETED PROGRAM IT WOULD ONLY BE FOR DISTRICTS RUNNING PART DAY PROGRAMS DUE TO FILL PHYLLIS FACILITY CONSTRAINTS. THAT COULDN'T BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE STATE'S REGULAR SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE THE ONE WAY YOU COULD TARGET AT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING WHAT YOU WANT. IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU COULD DO THAT FOR MUCH LESS MONEY THAN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. THE SECOND LARGEST PROPOSALS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR CHILD CARE WORK FORCE AND FACILITIES. THE STATE ALREADY HAS ONGOING PROGRAMS IN THESE TWO AREAS A SPENDS ABOUT FIFTY MILLION ANNUALLY ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS. AND TRAIN OTHERS FORMS FORMS OF TRAINING -- AND IT HAS A FACILITY REVOLVING LOAN FUND. SO I THINK WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IS INTENDED TO DO IS TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED IS EXISTING ONGOING PROGRAMS. BUT THERE'S A LOT THE STATE DOESN'T KNOW IN IS AREAS THAT DOESN'T HAVE BASIC INFORMATION LIKE THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE WORKERS THEIR EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT THEIR CREDENTIALS. HOW LONG THEY STAY WHY THEY LEAVE? FOR FACILITIES WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PROVIDERS OWN OR LEASE OF THOSE THAT LEASE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ARE SUBSIDIZED THROUGH OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE DON'T KNOW THE GREATEST FACILITY CHALLENGE US AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THOSE CHALLENGES VARY ACROSS THE STATE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION WE THINK THE STATE COULD OLLECT BEFORE IT -- GOES AHEAD AND A PORTIONS THOSE FIVE MIGHT BE AN AREA WHERE YOU WOULD WANT TO SPEND IN THE FUTURE YOU COULD SET THOSE MONIES ASIDE. STUDY THE ISSUES UPON GETTING THE RESULTS GO AHEAD AND OF COURSE IN THE FUNDS IN FUTURE YEARS. THERE IS A CONVERSATION EARLIER ABOUT THE PRESCHOOL PROPOSAL TO EXPAND IT TO ALTHOUGH INCOME STUDENTS CHILDREN. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE EXPANSION IS JUST VERY AMBITIOUS IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT ADDING TIME THOUSAND SLOTS IN A SINGLE YEAR IT'S A 40% INCREASE FOR THESE PROVIDERS WHO WOULD BE TASKED WITH DOING NOT. A BIG JOB FOR CD E. JUST TO SOLICIT APPLICATIONS REVIEW THEM FOR PROVIDERS TO FIND FACILITIES AND STAFF. SO WE'D RECOMMEND A SLOW ARAMBULA MAYBE SOMETHING MORE ON THE ORDER OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AT CHILDREN. I WOULD AGAIN FREE UP SOME MONEY IN YOUR BUDGET FOR OTHER THINGS THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNOR ALSO IS PROPOSING TO REMOVE THE WORK REQUIREMENT FOR THE FULL DAY SLOTS BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THE FISCAL IMPACT BUILT INTO HIS BUDGET. SO IF THERE WERE FAMILIES WHO ARE NOW USING PARK DAY SLOTS WHO ALL WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR FULL DAY THOUGHTS IF ANY OF THEM CHOOSE TO ENROLL FULL DAY. YOUR PROGRAMS GOING TO COST MUCH MORE THAN IS CURRENTLY IN YOUR BUDGET SO IF HALF OF THE FAMILIES DECIDED TO DO FULL THEY WERE IN THE PAST THEY WOULD HAVE THEM PART TODAY. THE PROGRAM'S GOING TO BE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SOME MILLION DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE OBVIOUSLY A FULL DAY SLOTS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PARTY SLOT MORE THAN DOUBLE THE COST. WITH THAT TEND. TO WITH THAT TEND TO CUT THE SLOTS FOR FAMILIES WHO ACTUALLY NEED HAVE FULL DAY CARE. YES SO IF YOU HAVE ANY PROJECTIONS ON ON THE IMPACT. I'M SO THERE WOULD BE TWO WAYS TO APPROACH A IF YOU DID WANT TO DO THE POLICY YOU COULD JUST PUT THE MONEY BEHIND IT AND MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T SEE THE DROP IN FULL DRAIN. OTHERWISE YOU WOULD SEE THE DROP IN CHILDREN AND THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BECOME TRIAGE DOES WE TRIAGE TODAY WHICH WOULD BECOME INCOME BASED SO EVEN IF A FAMILY WAS WORKING THEY MIGHT YOU LOSE THEIR SLOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER INCOME THAN SOMEBODY WHO STAYS AT HOME. SO GETS TO THE HEART OF YOUR FAMILY WHO IS CONTINUING TO WORK -- OR JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT EVERY LOW INCOME CHILD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEIR PARENTS ARE WORKING TO BE ABLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF A FULL DAY PROGRAM BUT YES ONE OF THE IMPLICATIONS AS IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE. THE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE MONEY YOU NEED TO COVER THE COST OF THE POLICY THEN FEWER CHILDREN WILL BE SERVED HIM VERY LIKELY FEWER CHILDREN FROM WORKING FAMILIES ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SO I WHAT I THINK WITH SOME FOLKS. WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN FAMILY WERE TO WORK ONE NO CAN'T WORK. WHICH PUTS THEM INTO A DIFFERENT. INCOME CATEGORY IT SORT OF SICK SIR CIRCULAR SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DO SOME ANALYSIS. OKAY WE WHAT CAN KERR SO I'M TURNING. TO NINETY EIGHT IS ONE OF THE MOST STREET FOR NINETY EIGHT BUDGET SHALL EVER SEE MOST OF THE MONEY'S GOING FOR COLA. AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT MAY MIGHT LOOK LIKE IT MIGHT NOT BE ONE OF THESE A FULL SURPRISES WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT MORE TO WORK WITH AND MADE IT COULD BE YOU EVEN HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS TO WORK WITH. IF STATE REVENUE COMES IN UNDER THE JANUARY PROJECTIONS WHICH IT IS TO DATE UNDER PROJECTIONS IN THE GUARANTEES GONNA DROP JUST THAT'S HOW THE FORMULA WORKS IT'LL DROP VERY ROUGHLY FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. SO WE JUST WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK NOW ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES ABOVE GROWTH IN COLAS ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES ARE SPECIAL ED IN THAT COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. EVEN IF YOU WERE TO CARE ABOUT THOSE AREAS WE THINK THERE ARE SOME MORE EFFICIENT WAYS YOU COULD GO ABOUT -- BOTH PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO SPECIAL EDUCATION AS WELL AS PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO FINANCIAL AID. WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT YOU JUST THINK ABOUT HOW TO POSITION SCHOOLS FOR WHAT WE THINK WILL BE ON THE HORIZON WHETHER IT'S NEXT YEAR OR A FEW YEARS FROM NOW RGARDING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE BEFORE YOU HAS NO ONE TIME CUSHION OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE HAVE PUT IN A ONE TIME QUESTION. ITS RANGE FROM FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO ONE POINT TWO BILLION BUT IT'S ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING IT'S AVERAGE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION THERE'S NONE OF THAT AND THE BUDGET BEFORE YOU. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT NOT ONLY IS THERE NOT A QUESTION BUT THE GOVERNOR AS ACTUALLY USING SOME ONE TIME FUNDING TO SUPPORT ON GOING PROGRAM. SO THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO NEXT YEAR AND THE VERY FIRST CALL ON YOUR DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE TO BACK FILL THIS WHOLE. STATE SOMETIMES DOES THIS WHEN IT'S IN REALLY TIGHT BUDGET TIMES WE DON'T ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO IT WHEN YOU'RE IN A GOOD BUDGET SITUATION SO THAT WHOLE RIGHT NOW IS SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. WE ALSO AS YOU WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT OUR YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ALREADY ON THE PENSIONS THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT TO GIVE A GREAT RELIEF TO DISTRICTS. BUT THIS IS A GOOD FISCAL ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE SENDING IS GOING UP THREE POINT 8% SO WE WOULD SUGGEST THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT TIME TO BE OFFERING RIGHT RELIEF YOU COULD PUT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A SCIENCE. AND GIVE THEM RATE RELIEF WHEN THEY'RE PER PEOPLE FINDING AS FLAT OR DECLINING THERE BUDGET SITUATIONS ARE MUCH TIGHTER THAN THEY ARE TODAY. WHAT PROP NINETY EIGHT IS AMONGST THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD BUDGET SHOW EVER SEE THERE'S MANY MORE MOVING PIECES TO HIRE ADD YOU'VE EXPLORED A LOT OF THOSE ALREADY THIS MORNING? WE THINK THE BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S BASIC APPROACH IS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AS OPPOSED TO THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHO GAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND HANDS OFF WALKED AWAY. THIS GOVERNOR'S TELLING YOU WHAT HE CARES ABOUT WE THINK THAT'S PRODUCTIVE YOU CAN SEE HOW WELL THOSE PARTIES ARE LINED WITH YOUR OWN. ONE OF THE LARGEST -- PARTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FOR COMPENSATION. HE HAS SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND HAS BUDGET ACROSS THE SEGMENTS TO PROVIDE TWO AND A HALF TO THREE AND A HALF PERCENT SALARY INCREASES FOR MOST EMPLOYEE GROUPS. MOST NINETEEN TWENTY CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN FINALIZED AND THEIR AGREED UPON NEGOTIATED RATE INCREASES ARE IN THAT RANGE. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING BUILT INTO HIS PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE NON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES WHICH IS ALL THEIR FACULTIES SO ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THEIR CORE FUNDED STAFF IS NOT REPRESENTED. YOU SEE HOW REQUESTED 3%. THE THINKING IS THAT THEY CAN FIND SOME OTHER REVENUE STREAMS TO COVER THAT COST BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY IN THE BUDGET FOR YOU. WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. EXPLORING WITH UC AND CSU THEM DOING -- STAFFING ANALYSIS WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE DOING THIS REGULARLY AND THEY WOULD LOOK AT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION DATA. AND THEN AT LEAST FOR NEXT YEAR YOU CAN HAVE INFORM YOUR CONVERSATIONS NEXT YEAR BUT BUT NON FACULTY PERSONNEL. I'M ACTUALLY ACROSS THE BOARD SO WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION REGULARLY ON FACULTY COMPENSATION BUT WE DON'T ON RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT WE ONLY GET THAT DATA THROUGH PERIODIC STUDIES AND WE HAVE VERY LITTLE DATA ON NON TENURE TRACK OR OTHER. FORMS OF UNIVERSITY STAFF. I'M ON A ROLL IT TARGETS YOU'VE HEARD THAT IT'S A HALF A PERCENT FOR THE COLLEGES 2% FOR CSU NOTHING FOR YOU SEE AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GUIDING FACTOR IS THAT EXPLAINS THE DIFFERENCE AS WE WOULD UGGEST YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME BASIC FACTORS. NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND HOW THAT'S CHANGING THE EXISTING ENROLLMENT LEVELS AND HOW WELL A LINE THEY ARE WITH THE MASTER PLAN. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ARE BEING REDIRECTED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE JUST BEING TURNED AWAY. THE FIRST TWO FACTORS WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU DON'T NEED A HIGHER ENROLLMENT TARGET NEXT YEAR IN THE LAST TWO FACTORS WOULD SUGGEST SOME GROWTH MIGHT BE WARRANTED. SO ON THE IMPROVEMENTS INITIATIVES WE JUST SUGGEST IF YOU DO DECIDE AND THERE'S SOME PRETTY. TOUGH TRADE OFFS AS TO WHETHER YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO PUT MONEY AND CITIES THE NATIONAL DOES BUT WERE YOU. TO ONE TWO WE WE JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW MEAN EXPLICIT EXPECTATIONS THAT THE SEGMENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO IMPROVE YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTATIONS THAT THEIR GRADUATES WOULD IMPROVE THEIR ACHIEVEMENT GAPS WOULD NARROW THEIR ACCESS UNIT TAKING WOULD BE REDUCED. THAT WOULD BE A VERY EXPLICIT CLEAR EXPECTATION. ON THE LIVING A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THE STATE HAS A LONG STANDING POLICY OF COVERING TUITION FOR ALL FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A LARGE SCALE LONG STANDING POLICY ON HOW TO COVER LIVING COSTS. AND YOU HAD A BIT OF THAT CONVERSATION THIS MORNING WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT. BUT BECAUSE THIS COULD BE A MAJOR EW POLICY FOR THE STATE WITH MAJOR NEW COST IMPLICATIONS RESEARCHERS. ARE LEARNING AS MUCH AS THE STATE KIND C. SO WE THINK THERE'S LOTS THAT COULD BE LEARNED. THE INCIDENTS AN UNDERLYING CAUSES OF HOUSING A FEW FOOD AND SECURITY WHY IT IS SO HIGH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES MUCH HIGHER THAN THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION AT LARGE. OBTAIN RELIABLE COST OF ATTENDANCE DATA FOR ALL KINDS OF STUDENTS INCLUDING STUDENT PARENTS. UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL AID WITH ALL THE OTHER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO HELP INDIVIDUALS WITH FOOD AND HOUSING. FIGURE OUT THE TRADE OFFS ARE AT LEAST CONTEMPLATE THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN PRETTY MORE MONEY AND TO COLLEGE STUDENTS AND MORE MONEY AND TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT LARGE. AND HAVE A MUCH BETTER SENSE OF WHAT IS THE UNMET NEED AND WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS FOR COVERING THEM I THINK YOU COULD GO THROUGH THE SAME ISSUES WITH MENTAL HEALTH THERE'S JUST A LOT THAT THE STATE DOESN'T KNOW YET. AND I THINK BEFORE THE STATE WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM JUST FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE IN MY ONE A STEP BACK AND LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE. I'M TUITION PREDICTABILITY THERE SEEMS TO BE BROAD CONSENSUS THIS WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF SOMEHOW THE STATE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE MORE PREDICTABLE TUITION NOT HIKES DURING. RECESSIONS AND THEN FLAT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME ELSEWHERE. WE THINK THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS MORE RESERVE. SO THE WAY IS HOW HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD UP YOUR RESEARCH. AND ONE WAY IS TO AT LEAST CONSIDER I'M TAKING THESE COST INCREASES BEFORE YOU WHETHER THEY BE FOR FACULTY OR FOR STUDENTS SUPPORT -- AND HAVING NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS ARE SOME OF THAT COST SO IF ALL COSTS ARE GOING UP 3% BOTH THE STATE AND NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS THE ONES THAT ARE PAYING THE TUITION AND NOT ALL THE CAL GRANT STUDENTS. I WHICH SHARON THOSE COSTS. RIGHT NOW NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS AT CS YOU PAY 23% OF THEIR EDUCATION COSTA NOTCSU I'M SORRY AT UC 13%. IT'S LOWER AT YOU SEE BECAUSE OF ALL THEIR NON RESIDENT TUITION AND THEY CAN USE THAT TO CROSS SUBSIDIZE THEIR RESIDENTS. BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE NON NEEDY STUDENTS ARE PAYING TODAY SO THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU IS WHETHER YOU WANT TO JUST KEEP THEM WHERE THEY'RE ADDED -- THEY'RE DROPPING THEIR SURE HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN DROPPING OVER THE SIX YEARS WERE FEES HAVE BEEN FLAT. IF YOU HAD A POLICY WHERE AS RESERVES ARE THE BEST WAY TO SIGNAL YOUR INTENTION TO KEEP TUITION PREDICTABLE OVER TIME A SHERIFF COST POLICY THAT WOULD SAY. A NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY FOR STUDENT THERE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE 102040% OF COST. IT WOULD HELP THEM KNOW WHETHER THEY ENTER COLLEGE DURING A RECESSION OR DURING A RECOVERY THAT WOULD BE THE COST THEY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BEAR. THE FINAL PAGES ON CAP OUT LATE -- WE AS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT A LOT ABOUT SUGGEST THAT YOU EVEN ACCELERATE MORE PROP FIFTY ONE BOND -- PAYMENTS. THE GOVERNOR HAS MUCH MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR DEAD TRIPLE THE AMOUNT FOR K. TWELVE THE BACKLOG IS SUBSTANTIAL WE SUGGEST YOU GO AHEAD AND DO THE ONE AND A HALFBILLION OR SOMETHING OF THAT MAGNITUDE. WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE THINK YOU COULD SUPPORT MORE PROJECTS EVEN WITH THE GOVERNOR HE IS PROPOSING MORE PROJECTS THAN IN THE PAST ALMOST MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED EACH AT PROPOSED EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. BUT HE'S STILL ON ABOUT A NINE YEAR TRACK TO SPEND ALL THE PROP FIFTY ONE DOLLAR SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT EXPEDITING NOT. WE ALSO WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE ADMINISTRATION THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE GET ON THE SAME PAGE AS TO THE STANDARDS THEY USE TO EVALUATE THESE PROJECTS YOU HEARD ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES EARLIER. IT DOES CREATE SOME FRUSTRATION IN THE FIELD THAT THEY'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT TAKES TO PUT TOGETHER A GOOD FACILITY PROJECT. WHERE ENCOURAGE THAT THAT FOR THE UNIVERSITY IS THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING PROJECT BY PROJECT AND SEEN IF THERE'S JUSTIFICATION FOR IT? NORMALLY THAT MEANS THAT WE LOOK AT THE FACILITY UTILIZATION AND SEE IF IT'S AT OR REACHED FOR IN EXCESS OF EXISTING CAPACITY. AND IS LOOKING AT COSTSTO MAKE SURE THEY'RE REASONABLE WE THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO REFINE SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS -- AS YOU GO THROUGH THE SEASON UNDER FOR MAINTENANCE AGAIN MANY PEOPLE THINK IT'S A GOOD YOU SOMEONE TIME FUNDS IT PREVENTS COSTLIER REPAIRS FROM BEING NEEDED DOWN THE ROAD. BUT WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU GOT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY WHAT PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE A HOT UNDERTAKEN. FINANCE REPORT A FEW YEARS AND NOW FROM NOW WERE THEY UNDERTAKE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG WAS THE BACKLOG REDUCED. DO THE SEGMENTS HAVE A PLAN FOR ULTIMATELY NOT HAVING THIS FOR SOME BILLION AT EACH STATEMENT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WITH THE REGARD TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PORTION OF PROP FIFTY ONE DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT. AUTHORIZED WAS IN AND WHAT'S BEEN. YEAH AND IT'S IT'S TWO BILLION UNDER PROP FIFTY ONE NOT AVAILABLE IF YOU ARE TO APPROVE EVERYTHING FROM A TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN APPROVED TO DATE AND ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION THAT YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED -- WE STILL THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY AT THIS PHASE IN THE GAME CENSURE THREE SOME YEARS AND YOU COULD CONTEMPLATE. DOING EVEN MORE THAN HAS THREE HUNDRED SOME MILLION NOT HE'S PROPOSE. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND WITH REGARD TO THE WE HAD THE BOND CONVERSATION EARLIER POTENTIAL BOND CONVERSATION ABOUT. REVOLVING AROUND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL NEEDS IT BOTH THE UC IN THE C. ISSUE -- CAMPUSES. REFRESH MY RECOLLECTION ABOUT TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AYE I WAS HERE I SEEM TO REMEMBER. WHAT I THINK I RECALL IS THAT THE -- OF THE OF THE BOND OBLIGATION WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE. TO IN THE CASE OF YOU SEE TO YOU SEE THAT WHAT HAPPENED. YEAH OUT WHERE WE WERE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT THIS AT THE TIME BECAUSE IT REPRESENTED SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM STATE PRACTICE HISTORICALLY. BUT YES AND TWENTY THIRTEEN FORTY THAT IT WANTED A NEW PARADIGM WHERE RATHER THAN THINKING ABOUT CAP OUT LAY AND SUPPORT AS TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES SEPARATE PARTS OF THE BUDGET WE WOULD PULL THEM TOGETHER INTO ONE ITEM AND EVERY YEAR IT MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU AND THE SEGMENTS. TO WEIGH THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN MORE MONEY FOR CAPITAL AND MORE MONEY FOR SUPPORT. SO AS PART OF THAT NEW PARADIGM AND THE SHIFT TO IT THE STATE CALCULATED IT NEW EFFECTIVELY WHAT IT WAS PAYING FOR YOU SEE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME. IT WAS -- TWO HUNDRED SOME MILLION DOLLARS AS I RECALL IT JUST SHIFTED INTO THE MAIN ITEMS THAT WE NO LONGER HAD A CAPITAL ITEM IN A SUPPORT ITEM WE JUST HAD ONE MAIN ITEM. AND SAID WELL YOU SEE YOU GO FORTH AND MANAGER FACILITIES SO SINCE THAT TIME YOU SEE HAS GONE TO THE MARKET THROUGH UNIVERSITY BONDS AND FINANCE THEIR PROJECTS. AND THEY STILL HAVE THAT TWO HUNDRED SOME MILLION SO THEY STILL ARE CARRYING SOME STATE GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND AT OF THOSE THIRTY YEAR SOME PROJECTS OF NOT RETIRED AT THIS POINT SO THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE MAKE SURE WE ARE AS A STATE AND THEY AS A STATEMENT MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE PAYMENTS ARE HONORED SO I GUESS THE POINT OF THE CONVERSATION IN THE POINT TO LOOKING BACK TO A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND. IS THEY MUST BE OUT OF BONDING. OR DO WE HAVE INSUFFICIENT BINDING CAPACITY. TO TAKE CARE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE UC CAMPUSES. YEAH I THINK THOSE WOULD BE THE KINDS OF ISSUES YOU WOULD WANNA START CONTEMPLATING AGAIN ALSO AS A REMINDER AS PART OF THE NEW PARADIGM. THE STATE PUTTING CAPS AS AN EFFORT TO SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA DELEGATE TO YOU UC AND CSU HOW TO MANAGE YOUR FACILITIES ENTER OPERATIONS BUT WE DON'T WANT YOU SPENDING MORE THAN 15% OF YOUR BUDGET ANNUALLY ON THAT ON CAPITOL THAT. SO IT DID CREATE SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT WITH THIS OLD CEMENT EXPECTATION THAT THEY NOT SPEND MORE THAN YOU WANTED ON THE CAPITAL SIDE SERVER GOES TO THE MARKET WE PUT A LIMIT ON ON THE FUNDING YOU EAT EXACTLY. SEE ISSUE DO WE DO THE SAME THING TO THE CSU CAMPUS YEAR LIKE YOU JUST SAID A YEAR LATER THEY HAVE THE SAME THE ISSUE IS THE SAME ISSUES PRESUMABLY YOU SEE DOES IN THAT REGARD. AFTER [inaudible] OKAY BUT ELEVEN QUESTIONS. I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION. SO YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE TEN THOUSAND MORE SLOTS BUT THAT'S A LITTLE SCARY WHEN YOU'RE THINKING THAT LOGISTICALLY WE JUST COULDN'T DO THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK. YEAH SO WE HAVE SOME I'M HIS HISTORY WE CAN RELY UPON SO A FEW YEARS AGO THE STATE GAVE THESE NON ALLEY A PROVIDERS THE ONES THAT ISSUE THOUSAND NEW SLOTS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THEM OKAY -- BUT TEN THOUSAND SPOTS IS THIS WELL YOU IDEALLY WANT THE SLOTS TO BE YOU IS YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING MONEY BEHIND THEM SO WE THINK. TWENTY FIVE A HUNDRED NEW SLOTS IS JUST A BIT OF A MORE PRACTICAL -- NUMBER. THE STATE HAS BEEN SO. AGAIN YOUR IF YOU COULD AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION THERE BUT YOU MIGHT SEE A HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT RIVER NEXT YEAR BECAUSE YOU JUST WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THE FOUGHT SHE WANTED SO THAT'S THE RISK YOU FACE. YOU CAN SET THIS TARGET HOWEVER YOU WANT WE'RE TRYING TO SUGGEST YOU SAID A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSERVATIVELY SO YOU DON'T. HAVE MONEY SITTING ASIDE IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT COULD GO FOR SOME PURPOSE GOT IT THANK YOU. WE HAVE QUESTIONS I GUESS NOT. THANK YOU ALL VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AT THE NEXT SERIES OF THESE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS. I THINK OF WHAT I WANT TO DO AT THIS POINT WE'RE GONNA TAKE A FIVE MINUTE RECESS IN A MINUTE BUT I UNDERSTAND THERE MAY BE SOME STUDENTS IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WOULD HAVE. SOMETHING. TO SAY AND WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC COMMENTS SO. WHILE I'M GOING TO GENERALLY.

A GOOD MORNING CHIRAC AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SUMMIT SEAL AND A CURRENT STUDENT AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SACRAMENTO MAKING PUBLIC COMMENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. WE SUPPORT THE OVERALL FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE CSU BUT WE REQUEST THAT TWENTY MILLION BE SET ASIDE FOR MENTAL HEALTH EIGHTY NINE OF THIS FOR HIRING OF COUNSELORS AND TWO MILLION. FOR HOW REPORT -- NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CAMPUS MENTAL HEALTH SURVEYS. GROWING CRISIS IS THE PHRASE USED BY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION DESCRIBES STATE OF MENTAL HELP ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. 52% OF STUDENTS REPORT FEELING HELPLESS AND THIRTY NINE POINT 1% REPORTED FEELING SO DEPRESSED THEY COULDN'T FUNCTION. THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNSELING SERVICES RECOMMENDS A RATIO OF A THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS FOR EACH FULL TIME EQUIVALENT COUNSELOR ON CAMPUS. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS ASKED AT A SENATE AT THE SENATE BUDGET MEETING THIS YEAR BY? SENATOR LEYVA WISE YES YOU DIDN'T RECEIVE FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH LIKE THE C. S. USE THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THE UC BUDGET PRIORITIZE IT BUT THE CSU DIDN'T. SEE IF YOU MAY PRIORITIZE WHAT MAY NOT HAVE HIGH TORQUE PRIORITIZE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. BUT IT NEEDS.

SO LAST YEAR I HELPED LEAD THE UC STUDENT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE -- THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE THAT FUNDING AND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID A TUITION HIKE FOR IN STATE STUDENTS. BUT AS YOU KNOW THAT MONEY WAS ONE TIME. SO WHILE WE ARE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE NEW GOVERNOR. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MAKE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF NINETY FIVE MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDS TO MAKE LAST YEAR'S FUNDING INCREASE PERMANENT. THE OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS WE AS YOU SEE STUDENT LEADERS WE WILL BE HERE WE WOULD BE PUSHING FOR THAT AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE BUDGET REQUEST. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE ARE DESERVING OF THE SAME HIGH QUALITY YOU SEE EDUCATION AS GENERATIONS PAST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME GOOD. LUCK IN YOUR POLITICS CLASS.

BUT IN ORDER TO TRULY HELP CALIFORNIA STUDENTS NOT JUST SIX FEET BUT SURVIVED THE STATE NEEDS TO FINALLY COMMIT THE FINANCIAL AID OR FORM. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE HAS RISEN EXPONENTIALLY ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO HOUSING. FINANCIAL AID HAS NOT INCREASED RESULTING IN THE BASIC NEEDS CRISIS WE SEE ON OUR CAMPUSES TODAY.LIKE THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO SEE OUR STUDENTS GRADUATE ON TIME IF YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THE WORK FORCE BUT WHEN A THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO SLEEP.

SB COLLEGE STAFF MEMBER I'VE HEARD PERSONAL ACCOUNTS OF HOMELESSNESS FROM STUDENTS ONE PARTICULAR STUDENT HAD TO SHARE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING IN A CAR WITH HER SIBLINGS. THE IMAGERY OF SEEING A STUDENT HAVING TO STUDY THESE CONDITIONS IS HEARTBREAKING. IN SPITE OF THESE EDUCATIONAL BARRIERS THE STUDENTS STAY RESILIENT. HOWEVER THE CONCERN OF BEING THROWN BACK INTO A STATE OF HOMELESSNESS IS VERY REAL. AND A TIME DOES IMPACT THEIR EDUCATIONAL FOCUS. I REALIZE THIS IS A STATE WIDE IS BACK TO THE RECENT FIRES. I KNOW THAT THE FUNDS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE -- TO ASSIST OF STUDENTS AFFECTED BY HOMELESSNESS BUT DEFINITELY HELP FOR ALL THESE REASONS I SUPPORT THE REQUEST FOR FUNDING TO ADDRESS ALMOST TO SPEAK YOU THANK YOU.

I THANK YOU DAN HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GENERAL THANKS FOR JOINING US. AMBER ALEXANDER ALSO WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU MA'AM. YOU MAY PROCEED. AND THANK YOU. CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND SEGMENTS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE BEEN STEADILY INCREASING THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS EFFORTS OVER THE PAST DECADE. HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT THESE EFFORTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER. MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO GAIN INFORMATION ABOUT HOW OTHER STUDENTS PERFORM ONCE THEY ENTER THE WORKFORCE. OR MOVE ON TO COLLEGE. CONVERSELY CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE NOT ABLE TO OBSERVE METRICS FOR HOW OTHER STUDENTS DID DURING THEIR TIME IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. AS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL STRIVE TO INCREASE STUDENT SUCCESS IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. IT WILL BE CRITICAL TO HAVE% ACCESS TO DATA THAT CAN HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES ON A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO PROGRESS THROUGH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND INTO THE WORK FORCE. TO THIS END THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TEN MILLION DOLLARS. ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PLAN FOR AND DEVELOP A STATE. STATEWIDE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. THIS IS THE MORE CONTENT CONNECTS TO INFORMATION FROM EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDERS K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS EMPLOYERS. BOTHER WORKFORCE ENTITIES AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. BUT PORTION OF THIS FUNDING WILL GO TOWARDS THE CREATION OF A WORK GROUP. THAT ONE FORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. THERE MANY FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL STAGES OF SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION. THE NEW SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO OPTIMIZE EXISTING PROGRAMS ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. AND CONDUCT RESEARCH ON EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. FURTHER A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO BETTER SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS. IN THE STATE'S PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. THE ADMINISTRATION IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND IS LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE DISCUSSION FROM TODAY'S -- PANELS FEATURING DID EXPERTS FROM K. TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT EDUCATIONAL LEADERS ARE INTERESTED IN INCLUDING AS PART OF A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING CONVERSATIONS RUNS PROPOSAL IN THE COMING MONTHS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WELL THIS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN LISTENING -- TO OF THE NEXT PANEL AND I'M HOPING THAT AS PART OF THAT SOMEONE WILL. TAKE JANEMR JANE IN PRE K. AND TAKE JANE THROUGH FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION AND TELL ME WHAT. THE DATA SYSTEM IS GOING TO TELL ME. ABOUT JANE. I'D BE INTERESTED TO HEAR THAT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT I HAVE NO QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT HOPEFULLY YOU WILL. JOIN US UP HERE AND WE CAN BRING UP THE SECOND PANEL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT WAY YOU'LL HAVE A MICROPHONE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS CONVERSATION. SO ONCE ALL ONCE EVERYBODY THE MUSIC STOPS AND EVERYBODY GETS A CHAIR -- LET'S -- IDENTIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD PLEASE WE'RE GOING TO START TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR WITH YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DAVID O'BRIEN ACTING CHIEF OF RESEARCH EVALUATION THE DATA FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSION THANK YOU MISTER BRIAN -- HOME OF DOCTOR DIPPED INTO REGION CHIEF LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION AND ADD ARE CORRECT THANKS FOR JOINING US PAMELA BROWN VICE PRESIDENT INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC PLANNING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON NATHAN EVANS CHIEF OF STAFF AND SENIOR ADVISER FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS WITH THE CSU OFFICE THAT YOU'RE. JOINING THIS AFTERNOON'S THEIR NOVEL MORGAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION. FOR AT STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND EDUCATION ANALYSIS MEASUREMENT ACCOUNTABILITY PARTY DIVISION. WHOSE US. AND CHRISTIAN OSMAN DEVICE CHANCE OVER THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'LL PROBABLY MESS UP NAMES SO OF TRYING TO CALL AND ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO START FIRST. YEAH I MEAN IT STARTS INSIDE OF THE JEANS AND THE ONE THERE AND MAY. I HAVE THE EARLY LEARNING SIDE OR AT LAST HAVE THE SIDE OF THE DATA. THOUGH I A MINUTE -- SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO FOR FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OF THAT CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDS WE COLLECT DATA MAINLY AROUND DEMOGRAPHICS AND AROUND FAN FAMILY ELIGIBILITY AND NEED. TO REALLY AROUND THE PROGRAMMER CREDIT REQUIREMENTS WE USE THE DATA FOR MONITORING PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND TO ENSURE STEWARDSHIP OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THE ONCE AGAIN A LOT BACK TO THAT FAMILY ELIGIBILITY AND NEED COMPONENTS BUT ALSO FOR TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CONTINUE IN PROVE MEANT. TO ENSURE THERE'S BETTER SERVICES TO ADDRESS AN ACCORDION RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE AS WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE VERSUS THE PERCENTAGE SERVED IN EACH OF THE COMMUNITIES. BUT REALLY I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND RESTRICTIONS IN THE DATA AND THE USE OF THE DATA DUE TO A LACK OF A UNIFIED SYSTEM AND DUE TO LACK OF UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS. SO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE CHILDREN FOLLOW THEM THROUGH OUR PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO GO IN AND OUT SO I CAN'T TELL YOU OF THAT SCENE CHILD. HAS LEFT AND THEN RETURNED AND WE ALSO CAN GIVE YOU AN ON DUPLICATED COUNT ON THE CHILDREN AND WE CAN'T TELL YOU IF THEY'RE ALSO RECEIVING HEAD START EARLY HEAD START. THE LOTS OF GAPS IN THE DATA DUE TO THE LACK OF AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND DUE TO THE LACK OF THOSE. AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS. WE KNOW WE NEED THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. TO ENSURE THAT WERE MOVING JUST FROM MONITORING TO ACTUALLY A SYSTEM THAT'S FOCUSED ON IMPROVEMENT. I TRULY DRIVEN DATA SYSTEM WE KNOW WE NEED TO MOVE FROM A FRAGMENTED DATA SYSTEM TO ONE THAT'S TRULY COORDINATED. AND FROM A SNAPSHOT JUST AT ONE POINT IN TIME TO LONGITUDINAL SO WE CAN SAY WHEN A BABY ENTERS AND THEN AS THEY GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM THROUGH PRESCHOOL AND THEN ON UP TO KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THIRD GRADE. SO WE COULD ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE. MEAN REALIZE THAT POLICY MAKERS NEED MORE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS IN SERVICE TO LOOK AT RESOURCE ALLOCATION. TO ASSESS THE IMPACT AND TO DEFINE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING THE QUALITY OF THOSE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. THOSE ARE THE SAME INFORMATION THAT RESEARCHERS ARE ALWAYS ASKING US FOR WE GET CONSTANT DATA REQUEST. I'M ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT CHILD OUTCOMES AND REALLY ADDRESS SOME POLICY IMPACTS AROUND THOSE INVESTMENT. PARENTS ALSO DEEPLY NEED MORE INFORMATION THEY NEED NOT TO JUST UNDERSTAND AVAILABILITY BUT THEY NEED GREATER INFORMATION AROUND IMPACT TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES. ABOUT THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE ACTUALLY NEED A DATA GOVERNOR IN THE INTEGRATION FOR BUSINESS NEEDS. AND FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL WE TRULY DEEPLY NO WE NEED UNIQUE IDEAS FOR EACH FAMILY PROVIDER AND FACILITY THAT RECEIVES OUR FUNDS. TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S ONLY ONE OF THREE STATES THAT DOES NOT SEND THE FULL POPULATION DATA WITH THOSE UNIQUE ES DE ID'S BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THE CITY IS TAKING STEPS RIGHT NOW AND USING THE FEDERAL PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE NEEDS ASSESSMENT. WE'RE DOING THIS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WORKING WITH THE STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON EARLY LEARNING AND CARE. THROUGH THAT WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AN ANALYSIS OF OUR DATA AND NINETY CAPS WERE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF IDENTIFYING AND ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE CREATION OF AN EARLY CHILDHOOD. INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM THAT THEN CONNECT BEYOND THAT SIDE OF EARLY LEARNING CARE DATA. INDICATE TWELFTH MY PARTNER NEXT TO ME THAT WE REALLY CAN FOLLOW CHILDREN AND WHAT WE'RE MISSING IS THAT ENTITY DEDICATED TO COLLECTING INTEGRATING AND REPORTING THAT DATA AND A WAY THAT'S USEFUL FOR YOU. ALSO USEFUL FOR RESEARCHERS AND TRULY USEFUL FOR PARENTS THAT CONCLUDES MY AND YOU MAKE MA'AM YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE THE ONE THAT I SHOULD DIRECT THIS TO BUT I'M TRYING TO GET AN IDEA. IN A PERFECT WORLD IF WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE A STATEWIDE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. THAT CENTRALIZED AND NOT WITH THE OTHER WORD FEDERATED NOT -- SO THERE'S SOME CENTRALIZED COLLECTION OF DATA. FROM PRE K. THROUGH. COMPLETION OF WHATEVER THE INSTITUTION IS TO YEAR FOUR YEAR. AM I ABLE TO DO WILL I BE ABLE TO TELL THAT BECAUSE JANE. A DIDN'T TAKE -- GEOMETRY AND HER SOPHOMORE YEAR. THAT. THERE'S SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT JANE DID AT CAL STATE. NORTHRIDGE IN HER. MATH PROGRAM AND SHE WAS. A SOCIOLOGY MAJOR AND WHEN SHE GRADUATED. SHE GOT A JOB AT MCDONALD'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NO JOBS I MEAN WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS DATA IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION I'M NOT AN EDUCATOR I'M LOOKING AT YOU ALL. SET UP LARGE MAYBE I SHOULD WAIT TO YOU ALL FINISH THEN LET ME ASK OKAY. SO WHO'S NEXT I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE JANE AND ONE AND NOW. THAT'S MY QUESTION I CAN DO THAT -- SO AGAIN TALKING THROUGH A K. TWELVE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE STATE IS INVESTED IN A LUNCHEON OF DATA SYSTEM FOR K. TWELVE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WE CAN TELL THAT JANE TOOK. GEOMETRY WHAT KIND OF GRADE SHE GOT WHETHER OR NOT SHE COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL IN THE FOUR YEARS ARE SHE COMPLETED IT AT A LATER DATE WE CAN TELL A. F. AS SHE WAS FORTUNATELY DISADVANTAGED IF SHE WAS A FOSTER USE IF -- IF SAME THINGS WITH -- ONE IF ONE OF THE MORE IN ENGLISH LEARNERS SO WE ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION -- WE DO HAVE DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH ENTERED INTO SOME OF THOSE AT TERRY DETERMINES FOR THE VERY REASON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT. WHAT ARE THEY MISSING OR WHAT HOW CAN WE AVOID -- HAVING STUDENTS GOING TO RADIO EDUCATION AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF AT AT ED CLASSES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE PREPARED FOR FOR MATH IN COLLEGE BUT THE KIDS FOLLOW UP LEVEL THAT'S WE COLLECT THAT WOULD HELP WITH WITH WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. OKAY AND THEN I AM I'LL JUST TRY ANOTHER QUESTION BUT I'M GONNA LET EVERYBODY PHOENICIAN SO THEN MIKE MY MY REAL QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE WHAT WE REALLY DO WITH THAT DATA ONCE WE FIND. WHAT'S WE GATHER WRITTEN AND WE COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT SOMEBODY MISTER MATH COURSE OR WHATEVER WHAT WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THE DATA. AND HOW DO WE USE IT IN THE LARGER. IN THE LARGER SCHEME OF THINGS WHICH IS WE EDUCATE PEOPLE. FOR SOCIETY IN THE WORKPLACE AND HOW THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER WHO'S NEXT. ALL MOVE ALL START CHRISTMAS WHEN YOU'RE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS THE CRUX OF KIND OF THIS DISCUSSION WE OFTEN START WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND WITH THE MEASURES. HAVE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY GET THE DATA TOGETHER. I THINK THE HEART OF THE QUESTION YOUR CHEN TO GETS TO IT IS KIND OF WHO IS THE AUDIENCE AND WHAT ARE THEIR GOALS -- HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU MAYBE IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO TALK THROUGH WAYS WE USE DATA TODAY. AND WAYS A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM MIGHT BE BETTER CHANCELLOR OAKLEY -- TALKED ABOUT THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. COR GOALS OF IMPROVING OUTCOMES REDUCE. THAT VISION FOR SUCCESS WAS PREDICATED ON OUR EXISTING ASSESSMENT OF KIND OF STATEWIDE AND ACROSS REGIONS ACROSS DISTRICTS WHERE WE SEE GAPS IN PERFORMANCE WHAT WE DO ABOUT THEM SO I THINK. THAT OF ONE AUDIENCE IS STATE POLICYMAKERS ARE BOARDS FIGURING OUT HOW TO IDENTIFY THE GOALS WHAT INTERVENTIONS TO BE PUT IN PLACE ONE OF THE INTERVENTIONS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR PUT IN PLACE LAST YEAR. WAS A NEW FUNDING FORMULA THAT LARGELY RELIED ON OUR EXISTING DATA OF THE NUMBER OF YOU KNOW LOW INCOME STUDENTS ACROSS DISTRICTS. OUT COMES ACROSS DISTRICTS THAT'S ONE THING WE COULD DO DIFFERENTLY -- YOU KNOW WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF DATA -- YOU KNOW A LONG STANDING ROLE FOR DINNER SYSTEM HAS BEEN PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY THAT WE HAVE SAID. DATA IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITIES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STUDENTS. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SERVING AND HOW WELL THEY'RE SERVING THEIR STILL STUDENTS WE HAVE -- SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN HAVE HAD A STUDENT SUCCESS CORKER SCORECARD AIMING TO DO JUST THAT TO SAY HERE'S THE YOU KNOW HERE'S THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. YOU AS A COMMUNITY MEMBERS A STUDENT AS A FAMILY MEMBER CAN WORK WITH YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. BLAST EXAMPLE AND AND WHAT I THIS I THINK CRITICAL TO OUR USE OF DATA -- HIS MAKING SURE A NEW DATA SYSTEM IS ABLE TO BE ACCESSED BY LOCAL PRACTITIONERS -- YOU KNOW CHANCELLOR OAKLEY THIS MORNING TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE WORK WE'VE DONE ON MAKING SURE MORE STUDENTS ENTER COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES. NOPE. PROCEED THROUGH COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE HISTORICALLY HAD RELIED -- ONE OF THE TOOLS WE HAD RELIED ON FOR PURPOSES OF PLACEMENT HAD BEEN AN ASSESSMENT BUT YOU COME TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU TAKE A PLACEMENT EXAM YOUR PLACEMENT EXAM TELLS YOU WHAT COURSES YOU'RE. READY. FOR WHAT WE HAVE MOVED TO IS LOOKING AT HIGH SCHOL GRADES AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT HIGH SCHOOL GRADES TLL US MUCH MORE. ABOUT WHAT A STUDENT -- HOW READY A STUDENT IS FOR COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES -- YOU KNOW WE COULD DO THAT ON A SELF REPORT BASIS STUDENTS CAN TELL US WHAT THEIR GPA WAS WHAT COURSES THEY TOOK. BUT I THINK WHAT GIVES US MUCH MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM IS AN ABILITY TO LOOK AT THEIR HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS. AND USE THAT FOR PLACEMENT DECISIONS SO I THINK AS WE TALK WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS PURPOSE OF TRADING LODGINGS PEOPLE THIS SYSTEM. I THINK WHAT WE THINK IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT -- WANTS TO THIS POINT TWO POINTS I WOULD JUST MAKE A BEFORE I CLOSE. THE FIRST IS THAT YOU KNOW I THINK. THE CLEAR KIND OF TAKE AWAY FROM US FROM THOSE EXAMPLES IS THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS -- IF WE CONNECTOR DATA THAT AS YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS NOT SIMPLY TO AWARD SOMEONE IT AGREE OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY SUCCEED IN THE WORK FORCE THE BUT YET EMPLOYMENT IN THE FIELD OF STUDY THAT PAY ACHIEVEMENT. FILED A LIVING WAGE THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE SHARE DATA AND EDIE SHARES DATA WITH US. I THINK THE OTHER POINT I WOULD JUST MAKE -- YOU KNOW OUR DATA DOESN'T ACT ON IT SO THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT SHOULDN'T STOP US FROM KIND OF TALKING ABOUT IN ACTUALLY PUTTING TOGETHER LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE IS WHAT WE WANT TO CHANGE AND WHAT ARE THE DECISION POINTS THAT WE'RE GONNA USE -- TO TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. I WILL HOLD THE REST OF MY COMMENTS AND HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL WELL I I YOU KNOW I'VE SAID FOR SOME TIME THAT -- IN THE IN THE EDUCATION IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION FIELD -- WE YOU ALL OF US NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WELL YOU'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUR CUSTOMERS AND YOUR CASE YOUR CUSTOMERS YOUR STUDENTS. AND ONE MEASURE OF THAT I THINK NOT BEING AN EDUCATOR IS A FIVE MOVE THROUGH A PROGRAM AND I GET A CERTIFICATE AT RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE OR I GET A A DEGREE AT RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE WITH A CONCENTRATION IN WHATEVER. WHAT WHAT AM I DOING TWO YEARS FROM NOW? IN MY IN MY ABLE TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO SOME SOMETHING THAT'S USEFUL. OR DOES THE MARKET PLACE NOT CARE ABOUT WHAT I DID AT RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE IN WHICH CASE. I WOULD BE NICE IF I HAD KNOWN THAT GOING IN. AND ONE ELEMENT OF THIS LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM IS PERHAPS IF IT WORKS. I'LL BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT AND CAN MAKE DECISIONS I MAY DO WHAT I DID ANYWAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO BUT BE NICE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION. OKAY MAYBE PRIDE TWO EXAMPLES -- YOU KNOW I THINK IN AND I THINK THAT EXAMPLE HIGHLIGHTS KIND OF THE MIND SHIFT -- MINDSET SHIFT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A SENSE TO LONG TIME WE HAVE RELIED ON TRANSFER READY. AS THE WAY IN WHICH WE ASSESS WHETHER WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB MEETING OUR TRANSFORMATION THAT WE SAID. YOU KNOW IF THE STUDENT IS TAKING THE RIGHT COURSES AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE COURSES THEY NEED TO TRANSFER THE UC AND CSU WE WILL SEE THAT AS KIND OF YOU KNOW SUCCESS FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS DID WAS SAY WE ACTUALLY SHOULD CARE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED TO UC AND CSU. FOR THEIRS I THINK THE POLICY DECISION THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE BUT TO SUPPORT THE POLICY DECISION -- YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL DATA THAT WOULD LET US KNOW THAT WE NOW GET FROM YOU SEE CSU IN THIS NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE BUT SAYS THIS IS WHERE THE STUDENT. WHAT TO AFTER THEY LEFT YOUR INSTITUTION I THINK THE OTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AROUND OUR SALARY SURFER? THAT NOW GIVES STUDENTS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO SAY IF I MAJOR IN ACTS ARE A COMPLETE THIS PROGRAM OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HERE'S THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION I CAN HAVE. BUT THE CAREERS I CAN ENTER INTO AFTER IT. AND THAT WILL INFORM OUR CAREER TECH EDUCATION C. T. E. EFFORTS. DIRECTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND IF THEY GO THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. SOMETHING GOOD IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM. YES THEY COULD BUT I THINK THAT'S I THINK WE NEED TO PLACE ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW I THINK AGAIN THE DATE ON ITS OWN DOESN'T DO THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE WE'RE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND SAYING. THE DATA WE GET FROM THE SYSTEM ABOUT WHERE STUDENTS ARE GOING AND WHAT THE YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE OUR CAREERS AT A LIVING WAGE I HAD. SHOULD BE INFORMING OUR DECISION I THINK WE NEED WE BUILD THE DATA SYSTEM CREATE THAT SPACE FOR THAT CONVERSATION AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PRIORITY. AND I GUESS IN THE OTHER QUESTION IS. DATA ACCESSIBLE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BEING ACCESSIBLE AMONG YOU ALL. IS SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. I THINK THAT'S A CORE INTERNATIONAL BUT OTHERS GET IT. WELL I THINK THAT'S A CALL OR KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ABOUT GOVERNMENT'S ABOUT WHO IS THE AUDIENCE WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO WITH THE DATA. AND HOW DO WE BALANCE PRIVACY CONCERNS WITH -- THAT USE OF DATA. THANKS TO THE SO I THINK WHAT MAYBE CONTINUE ON THE POT SECONDARY SEGMENT -- AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES -- ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS NATHAN EVANS I AM THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND SENIOR ADVISER FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS AT THE CSU OFF THE CHANCELLOR AND I'M GONNA DISPENSED WITH SOME OF MY PREPARED COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK -- TO TO MISTER AND MENUS POINTING AND DISCUSSION A LOT OF IT IS TALKING ABOUT SCENARIOS THINGS SUCCESSES BECAUSE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DATA SHARING HAPPENING AMONG ALL AMONGST ALL THE ENTITIES YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU -- SOME OF IT IS PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE EXAMPLE THAT KRISTIN MENTIONED THE D. OUTCOMES SO LOOKING BY CAMPUS BY DISCIPLINE WHERE OUR STUDENTS LAND IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE TODAY BACKWARDS MAPPING YOU KNOW FOR THROUGHOUT THE PAST DECADE -- WE HAVE OTHER GREAT EXAMPLES AND WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ENOUGH FOR EXAMPLE OUR LONG STANDING EARLY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALSO PARTICIPATE IN WHICH IS USING THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT ELEVENTH GRADE. AND LOOKING AT THAT AS A PRODUCTIVE AND AYE AYE PREDICTOR OF COLLEGE READINESS IN ENGLISH AND MATH. WELL THE REALITY IS -- WHEN WE WORKED WITH CITY ON ON LOOKING AT A LONGER RANGE OF DATA? WE COULD BACKWARDS MAP THAT TO STANDARDIZE THE THE SORT OF ANNUAL ASSESSMENT THAT'S DONE ALL THE WAY BACK TO THIRD GRADE SO THE NEEDS FOR INTERVENTION. WHILE THEY ARE IMPORTANT pGETTING READY IN STUDENTS READY FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION THE REALITY IS WE VIEW O LOOKING AT THAT DATA COMBINED BIG. COMBINING OUR TWO SEGMENTS REALLY INDICATED THAT THE EFFORTS HAD TO START FAR FARM EARLIER -- ALL THE WAY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND SO IT'S ONLY THROUGH THE ABILITY TO SHARE -- ON A REGULAR BASIS AND NOT JUST LOOKING AS A AT A POINT IN TIME AS WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH PAT BUT ABLE TO BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT THE DATA IT LONGITUDINALLY. ONLY TO FALL INFORM INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES BUT AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TO TO INFORM STUDENTS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES FROM A CONSUMER STANDPOINT FROM -- PLANNING AND CAPACITY PLANNING A STANDPOINT AND REALLY THAT'S IT I THINK THE CRUX OF OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH WITH THIS DATA WE HAVE NUMEROUS PROJECTS WE CAN ALL TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ARE ARE. ARE DOING A GREAT AMOUNT OF DATA SHARING BUT IT IS SORT OF PROJECT BASED AND IT IS REALLY LOOKING AT WHATEVER AYE AYE NARROW -- TOPIC MIGHT BE AT ONE TIME SO THERE IS IN OWN I PRAY WORK OF OUR FACULTY OUR INSTITUTIONS TO INFORM THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE TO INFORM THE THE STATE -- AND OTHER PRACTITIONERS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN AND SUPPORTING OUR EDUCATION ALL THAT THIS SORT OF CRADLE TO CAREER PIPELINE IT FOR TALKING ABOUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU I WAS VERY VERY IMPRESSED WITH OUR REGION ON READING THE ANALYSIS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO GET. PREPARED FOR THESE. THIS TYPE OF HEARING -- HOW MANY HOW MANY DIFFERENT? DATA COLLECTION OPERATIONS WE HAVE IN THE STATE THAT SEEM TO BE DOING QUITE WELL -- THE QUESTION IS HOW DO THEY RELATE AND IF IF I SPEND TWO YEARS AT CAL STATE SAN FERNANDO AND FLIP. TO YOUR RECEIVE CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE IS OR SOMETHING THAT COLLECT CONNECTS ALL THAT SO THAT IF I'M AT THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL. I CAN I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PARTICULAR PERSON AND IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO KNOW. WHAT THEY DID IN -- K. THROUGH TWELVE TO YOU KNOW TO SEE IF THERE WERE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS BACK THEN THAT RESULTED IN A IN A CAREER CHANGER ACADEMIC CHANGE -- THE ISSUE WERE YOU SEE. SO -- I'M NOT CRITICAL AT ALL OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING I THINK IT'S ACTUAL CYST QUESTION I GUESS THAT'S WHY GOVERNOR PUT THIS IN THE BUDGET. WHETHER WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GREAT AT ALL AND HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT IF ONE OF YOUR CAMPUSES OR ONE OF YOUR SYSTEM OFFICES BE ABLE TO PUSH A BUTTON. AND AND FIGURE OUT SOMETHING. YES MA'AM RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME PAMELA BROWN VICE PRESIDENT FOR INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC PLANNING AT THE UNIVERSITY. OF CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN DOING INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH NOW FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AS SIXTEEN OF THEM ON THE BERKELEY CAMPUS IN THE PRESIDENT. AND I KNOW THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM FOR ME AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT STUDENTS BOTH UNDERSTANDING -- FOR HIGH SCHOOLS IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHAT HAPPENS ON THE ADMISSION SIDE ENROLLMENT AND BEING ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION ON HOW MANY GRADUATE AND THEN ON THE OUTCOMES TIED FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS ON BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW THAT CAREER AT THAT THEY GO INTO A AND THEIR EARNINGS AND THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR HAVING A DEGREE WE FOCUS QUITE A BIT ON THAT WE'VE LEVERAGED ARE OUR SYSTEM. TO INFORM THE MULTI YEAR FRAMEWORK THAT -- CFO BROSS FROM TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY MAKE SURE THEY WERE MEETING THE GOALS THAT ARE THERE I'VE I'VE PUT TOGETHER AT A HANDOUT -- THAT LAYS WHAT THE THE DATA SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE FOR US AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH I APPRECIATE IS MUCH SIMPLER THAN -- A MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AROUND THE TABLE THAT HAVE MANY MORE CAMPUSES AND DISTRICTS TO WORK WITH -- BUT IT HIGHLIGHTS THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT ON STUDENTS -- UNDER THE INPUT SIDE IT HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE TOP AREAS OF THE DATA WAREHOUSE SIDE SOME OF THE KEY FUNCTIONS. AND THE WAYS THAT WE SHARE THAT INFORMATION THE OUTPUT -- FOR THE AUDIENCES THAT WERE SERVING. OF THE KEY -- AREA THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF INVESTMENT AND TIME SPENT ON IS THIS DATA WAREHOUSE -- SECTION OF IT THE NOT SOME BOLTS OF IT AND I'LL JUST MENTION FOR AREAS THAT I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERING PUTTING TOGETHER STATEWIDE SYSTEM ONE IS THE QUALITY OF THE DATA -- WE SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME CHECKING THE DATA THAT WE HAVE THAT COMES IN WE AUTOMATE THE PROCESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS EACH YEAR SOMETHING SPECIAL COMES ALONG. AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOADING IS ACCURATE AND COMPLETE -- WE HAVE SET UP THIS THIRTY IN PLACE THAT NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED IT NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED -- ALONG THE WAY SO THERE'S AN ONGOING INVESTMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE. AND WE ALSO WORK QUITE A BIT ON ENSURING THAT WE'RE PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF OUR STUDENTS. AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT IS HOW WE SHARE THE INFORMATION -- WITH -- THE PUBLIC. WE KNOW THE VALUE OF THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT SO WE FOCUSED A LOT ON GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE YOU SEE ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT THAT WE'VE STARTED WHICH HAS. GOT INFORMATION ON OPERATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD -- WE SHIFT MORE INFORMATION NOW INTO WHAT WE CALL ARE YOU SEE INFORMATION CENTER IT'S THE INTERACTIVE WEBSITE -- THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO GO IN AND WE ANSWER THE TOPPLING QUESTIONS BUT THEY HAVE SOME FUNCTIONALITY TO FILTER FOR CAMPUS OR LOOK AT IT FOR DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS AND THAT GIVES THEM MORE INFORMATION. ON WHAT THEY CAN. LEARN ABOUT -- IT ALSO GIVES US A LITTLE BIT MORE THE RESEARCH THAT WE NEED TO DO TO INFORM -- THE UNIVERSITY THE STATE ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE -- ARE COMING UP AT SO THOSE ARE CRITICAL AREAS YOU -- YOU RAISE SOME GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU HOULD EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF IT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF CALIFORNIA BEING IN THE SPACE THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES THAT YOU CAN LOOK TO TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY DID WITH THEIR LESSONS LEARNED WERE -- WHAT THEY COLLECT WHAT THE REPORT AND HOW THEY MANAGE RESEARCH AND THINK ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WANT TO GET OUT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? YOU RAISE A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW CAN I GET DOWN TO KNOWING IF SOMEBODY DIDN'T TAKE A GEOMETRY CLASS WILL THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON WHAT IT IS. I THINK LAYING OUT THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER IS A REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF WORK I CAN'T UNDER ESTIMATE. WHAT IT TAKES TO MAINTAIN A SYSTEM LIKE THIS -- IFYOU WANTED TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT INFORMATION TO START MY MY RECOMMENDATION IS ALWAYS START SMALL SUCCEED LEARN FROM THAT AND AND BUILD -- BUT WILL WE FAILED THAT. IT'S ITS IT'S SOMETHING I LIVE BY WITH WITH THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS BUT LIKE THEQUESTION THAT YOU ASKED ONE OF THE WAYS YOU COULD APPROACH IT IS. TO COLLECT INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU THE CHAINS ARE ONES I THINK THOSE ARE THE NAMES WERE WORKING WITH THAT ARE STRUGGLING FIND OUT IF THEY'RE CONCENTRATED WITHIN PARTICULAR DISTRICTS. AND THEN GO IN AND ASK FOR COURSE LEVEL DETAIL YOU KNOW YOU GO TO IN ORDER THAT SHE WAS IN IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU YOU NEED VARIOUS LEVELS HERE. IF I'M EDUCATORS. WHO ARE PLANNING FOR EDUCATORS? NEED A CERTAIN GRANULARITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE DATA AND THEN YOU MAY NEED. TO PRIVACY BECOMES AN ISSUE BECAUSE I MAY NEED TO KNOW WHAT A PARTICULAR STUDENT OR GROUP OF STUDENTS. DID OR DID NOT DO AT SOME POINT IN THE PROCESS THE PUBLIC ON THE OTHER HAND. HI THERE -- AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC OR AS A PARENT I DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT CHARLIE DID THIS OR ONE HUNDRED JANE OR SAM. A WHAT I NEED TO KNOW GENERICALLY IS YOU KNOW SOCIOLOGY GRADUATES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ RIGHT HAVE A LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING THIS KIND OF JOB ARE DOING THIS KIND OF THING. OF POST GRADUATION RATE IN. AND I THINK ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS ARE WORKING ON DOING EXACTLY THAT WE CAN TELL YOU FOR THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE COME TO OUR INSTITUTIONS. THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY MAJOR IN. THE FIELDS THAT THEY GO IN THE INDUSTRIES THE WORK TOGETHER ON TRYING TO MAKE THAT AS CONSISTENT AS POSSIBLE AS A PARENT YOU GO TO EACH OF THE SITE SO I UNDERSTAND. THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT I KNOW IT'S MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR US TO BE ABLE. TO TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY OF ABOUT THE OUTCOMES OF GETTING A UC DEGREE AND WHAT THAT MEANS -- I JUST THINK THAT THE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED STARTING WITH WHAT YOU THINK ARE SOME OF THE TOP PRIORITIES. GIVES YOU A WAY TO PRIORITIZE WHAT YOU INITIALLY WANT TO COLLECT AND THEN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO THEN INTEGRATE THAT TOGETHER INTO A SYSTEM. AND THEN IF THAT GIVES YOU A A WAY TO START THEN YOU CAN BUILD FROM THAT HAVING THAT -- UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONNECTIONS THAT ARE THERE -- SITTING ISSUE [inaudible] DR. I AM HOME A DOCTOR WITH P. DIDDY AND YOU HEARD ABOUT IT A COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT EIGHTY THE EDT CONNECTS LOSS OF DATA SUCH AS DISABILITY INSURANCE CLAIM AND STATE ARE. BEARD FAMILY LEAVE A DATA YOU AYE CLEMENTS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMANTS DATA. EMPLOYEES VH AREN'T UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DATA JOB SEEKERS DATE OUR VOTE FOR WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT W. I. YOU A VETERAN ADVISER TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ELIGIBILITY TRAINING PROVIDERS LIST CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS DATA OCCUPATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES COLLECTED THROUGH ESTABLISHMENT SURVEY TWICE A YEAR. CALIFORNIA LABOR FORCE NUMBER OFTEN FLORIDA NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYED. UNEMPLOYMENT DATE. FOR STATE AND LOCAL AREAS INDUSTRY AND OCCUPATION EMPLOYMENT PROJECTION DATA SO MORE DETAIL ABOUT ALL THESE DATA IS PROVIDED -- AND THE HAND OUT OF IT IS THAT I THINK YOU HAVE THAT HANDOUT. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. I HAVE THAT YEAH OKAY. SO AFTER REVIEWING TATE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEMS FOR MULTIPLE STAIRS I CAME UP WITH THE CONCLUSIONS THAT EDT STORE DATA SERVICE. BASS RIDGE FILED FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS INDUSTRY DATE OF AND PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BUILDING OUR STATE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. THESE TWO DATA SETS CONTAIN INFORMATION THE END CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS FOR APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN MILLION CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES WITH THEIR NAMES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS VERY DESPAIRED. PERSONAL INCOME TAX WITHHELD MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT TOTAL QUARTERLY BRIDGES AND INDUSTRY COURT. THESE DATA SETS WILL HELP US TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF GRADUATES IN FLOYD IN CALIFORNIA MEDIAN OR AVERAGE EARNINGS OVER TIME SUCH AS ONE THIRTY FIVE YEARS AFTER GRADUATION. WE WILL BE ALSO ABLE TO GET OUR NAMES FOR GRADUATES BY INDUSTRY THAT FREUDIAN. SO BUT THERE ARE FEW LIMITATIONS OF ALL THESE DATA SETS I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION DATA DOES NOT PALATABLE BECAUSE I'M FLOYD FULL TIME OR PART TIME. INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE GRADUATE SWAT EMPLOYED ONLY IN CALIFORNIA. DOES NOT PROVIDE OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION THAT BEACH OCCUPATION THEY ARE EMPLOYED IN. NOT INCLUDED IN THE FILE ARE SELF EMPLOYED FEDERAL EMPLOYEES RAILROAD WORKERS STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTED OFFICIALS WORK STUDY STUDENTS INSURANCE AND REAL ESTATE AGENTS BEARD ONLY BY A COMMISSION AND FEW MORE WHAT WHAT WOULD WORK BEST UP WHY WHY IS THAT. I MEAN WE PAY STATE TAXES. I THINK A WELFARE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU WAIT YOU A TAX EFFORT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WEIGHT AT TECH. TAXES TOLD THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED SO EVEN THOUGH OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE WHO RESIDES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WOULD WOULD FILE A CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME TAX RETURN YEAH SO I'VE I'VE. WELL YOU PROBABLY HAVE ME IN YOUR SYSTEM BUT YEAH STATE WORKERS FILE CALIFORNIA. STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS STATE WORKERS ARE LIKE NINETY CALIFORNIA NINETY EIGHT POINT NINETY EIGHT POINT 5% BUSINESSES ARE LIKE. ARE COVERED UNDER YOU WHY IS THERE ANOTHER DATABASE THAT -- WHERE WE COULD CAPTURE SO IF I GRADUATE FROM? THE UNIVERSITY OF YOU SEE I CALIFORNIA IRVINE AND I GO TO WORK FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IN ORANGE COUNTY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ME IN YOUR SYSTEM BUT I'M GONNA BE FILING A CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME TAX RETURN. HOW WOULD I GET THAT INFORMATION ACTUALLY IS FOR DATA COMES FROM THE EMPLOYERS? AND ALL THE EMPLOYEES RETIRED. BY THAT EMPLOYED HEY PROVIDE US THE DATA I SEE YOU DON'T YOU HAVE IT'S THE EMPLOYER RETURNED IT FOR YOU I RETURN FORTNIGHTLY AND QUARTERLY RETURN YOU USE. WE YOU DON'T ACCESS YOU CAN BARELY ACCESS THE CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME TAX RETURN DATABASE. WITH THERE MUST BE ONE FRANCHISE TAX WE DO COLLECT INCOME TO L. PERSONAL INCOME TAX THROUGH -- THAT QUARTERLY COLLECTION FROM THE EMPLOYEE I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY -- BUT LEE IS HERE IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION. CONSIDER UP MAYBE. I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR IT WAS JUST FASCINATING BECAUSE I'VE READ ALL THIS IN HERE AND I THOUGHT WELL I WONDER WHY WE CAN'T CAPTURE THAT OTHER DATA BECAUSE THEY DO FILE RETURNS I DO THINK IT'S ALSO KIND OF WHO'S AT THIS TABLE TODAY THAT MAYBE. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD SHOULD BE AT THIS TABLE I WOULD SAY -- YOU KNOW I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO USE THE DATA FOR YOU I THINK WE FOUND THAT. BECAUSE NEARLY ALL OF YOU KNOW WE FIND NEARLY ALL OF OUR FORMER STUDENTS. IN THE EDT -- DATABASE THAT -- FOR THE PURPOSES WERE USING IT FOR TODAY KIND OF OUTCOMES FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS -- THAT SUFFICIENT IF THERE'S SOME OTHER INDIVIDUAL LEVEL -- KIND OF QUESTION THAT FOLKS HAVE THOUGH IT -- IT MAY NOT BE ESPECIALLY FOR LOOKING AT CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. THE OTHER POINT I WOULD JUST MAKE ON THAT POINT IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS KIND OF IN A PIPELINE METAPHOR THAT WE OFTEN USE THAT STUDENTS GO FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER -- MANY TIMES STUDENTS YOU KNOW ARE TENDING MULTIPLE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AT ONCE BUT THEY'RE ALSO ACCESSING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. THAT YOU KNOW WITH FOLKS THAT ARE NOT THIS TABLE TO CAL FRESH BUT IF IT'S CAL WORKS BENEFITS -- THAT AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE QUESTION YOU KNOW CHANCE OAKLEY TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS IF WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE STATE IS MEETING BASIC NEEDS. OF IT I THINK THOSE OTHER KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THE VARIETY OF PROGRAM STUDENTS ARE ACCESSING WOULD BE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT RIGHT I I AND AND I'M SURE. I JUST WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE OF AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT. DATA POINT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD CAPTURES. A STATE INCOME TAX RETURN BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS YOU HAVE TO LIST YOUR OCCUPATION SO YOU MIGHT GET. A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE OCCUPATION BEYOND INDUSTRY CODE BECAUSE INDUSTRY CO JUST SORT OF BROAD -- THAT WOULD JUST BE ONE EXAMPLE I THINK AND THEN THEY'RE OTHER PEOPLE PROBABLY THERE MAY BE OTHER BE BE OTHER PEOPLE WHO. FOLLOW CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME TAX RETURN. BUT DON'T NECESSARILY WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WERE THERE WOULD NOT BE AN EMPLOYER RETURN THAT HAD THAT CAPTURED THE EMPLOYEE I. I REALIZE I'M GETTING INTO. I LOVE YOU GETTING INTO THE READ THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE LIVE AND OCCUPATION IS SORT OF THE HOLY GRAIL THAT WE ALWAYS WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET -- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT TRYING TO ACCESS IT ON MANY OF THAT -- TAX FORMS WHEN WE'VE TRIED TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT ENDS UP BEING A TEXT FIELD. OF VERSES IN INDUSTRY CODE WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING TO WORK WITH BUT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF THERE ARE ARE WAYS YOU CAN LEARN IT SO. IT'S SO GETTING A SENSE AGAIN OF WHAT WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER AND THEN HOW THE DATA IS COLLECTED ALL HELP YOU FIGURE OUT HOW SUCCESSFUL IT'D BE I KNEW THIS WOULD BE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION I THINK I HAVE A GERMAN HERE'S SENATOR OFF MY NAME'S. BRADLEY HODGES ON THE TAXPAYER RIGHTS ADVOCATE FOR THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING DATA AND YOU WERE ON POINT WHEN YOU MENTION THAT IT'S EIGHTY THESE QUARTERLY WAGES. SO WOULD BE INDIVIDUALS BY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. THE WAGES THAT THEY AREN'T IN THE WITH HOLDINGS THAT THEY HAD BUT THAT'S REPORTED BY EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYER OR CALIFORNIA. AND IT WOULDN'T INCLUDE CERTAIN TYPES OF AN EXEMPT EMPLOYMENT OR WAGES THAT ARE REPORTED TO BE DE MAYBE FROM FEDERAL EMPLOYERS SO HE WAS JUST TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT THERE COULD BE SOME GAPS IN THAT DATA. AND WE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK OTHER AREAS YOU REFERENCED -- THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS TRUE THEY DO BUSINESS AND INDIVIDUAL AND TAX RETURNS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND NONRESIDENTS THIS HAD WITHHOLDING SO. I MEAN I I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S A PLACE THAT THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD WANT TO LOOK. BUT I KNOW THAT EDT DOES CURRENTLY SHARE DATA WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE -- EDUCATIONAL FOLKS. AND HE WAS WILL SOME DAY IS BETTER THAN NONE BUT I GUESS SINCE WERE. TRYING. TO SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO PUT A SYSTEM TOGETHER WE MIGHT AS WILL OPEN THE CANOPY WAS ISSUES OR THROUGH. I THINK HE SAID YOU OF SIR THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. IF NEEDED FOR THIS LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM GRADUATES CAN BE MATCHED USING SSM BID THE EDT IS GOOD IN THE STATE OF THEIR TOP OF FIND OUT IF THE HOW. TO IF THEY HAVE APPLIED FOR THE WAY BENEFITS DA BENEFITS BEARD FAMILY LEAVE OR EVEN IF THEY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN. WORKFORCE TRAININGS AND EMPLOYMENT SUCH AS MIKE A MICRO LEVEL DATA SHARED WITH THE ENTITIES AUTHORIZED UNDER CALIFORNIA YOU A QUARTER SECTION. TEN NINETY FIVE EDT HAS EXISTING DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES JOHNSON AS OFFICE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION CENSUS BUREAU DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. AND FEW OTHER CALIFORNIA STATE DEPARTMENTS AND CALIFORNIA LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANNING AGENCIES. UPON REQUEST A NONCONFIDENTIAL GET TO DATE UP. OUR SHARED WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. PRIVATE EDUCATION AND ENTITIES RESEARCH GROUPS ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS AND MEDIA. FOR PUBLIC USE WOULD PUBLISH. AGGREGATED DATA ON THE EDT WEBSITE. A AND ALSO WE HAVE AS I MENTIONED -- DAVIDOVICH'S INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS DATA. A THAT DATA TELLS THAT ABOUT THE INDUSTRIES AND OCCUPATIONS WHICH ARE DECLINING AND GROWING AND ABOUT APPLICATIONS HOLD MANY JOB OPENINGS. L. R. N. LIKE WE WE DO THE LONG TERM. A PROJECTION FOR TEN YEARS THAT HOW MANY OPENINGS WILL BE THERE FOR THEIR SPECIFIC OCCUPATION HOW MUCH THE PERSON WILL BE EARNING. AND WHAT IS THE WELL I EDUCATION REQUIRED FOR THAT KIND OF OCCUPATION GOOD. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR I DAVID O'BRIEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- I'M HERE TO ADDRESS -- DATA IN THE THE SORT OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY PIECE OF THE QUESTION AND HOW IT RELATES TO WHAT WE DO SO AS YOU KNOW WHERE THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION AND MANY MORE WE RECEIVE A LOT OF DATA -- SEVERAL MILLIONS OF POINTS OF DATA PER COMES DIRECTLY FROM STUDENTS THEMSELVES SO WHEN JANE OR WAN -- IS GETTING READY TO APPLY FOR COLLEGE. ABOUT HALF OF THEM SO STATISTICALLY ONLY CHEN OR WAN BUT NOT BOTH OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA WILL FILL OUT AN APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL AID THE MAIN FORMER WHICH IS THE FAST THE FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID -- IF THEY ARE INELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA THEY CAN FILL OUT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION. AT THE COMMISSION WE RECEIVED OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION FAST -- APPLICATIONS EVERY YEAR FROM STUDENTS BOTH. IN CALIFORNIA AND STUDENTS FROM OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA OF INDICATED THAT THEY WANT A PLATE OF A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE UNIVERSITY. AND THAT CONTAINS DATE OF BIRTH AGE GENDER OR INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR INCOME THEIR PARENTS INCOME -- AN ADJUSTMENT AND SO FORTH AND THEN ALSO FROM ALL PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA WE RECEIVE -- WAITED STUDENT GRADE POINT AVERAGE WHICH IS REQUIRED TO CALCULATE THE CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY SO ARE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS HAVE THREE DIFFERENT GPA MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON WHICH PROGRAM. THE STUDENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE WE RECEIVE ALL OF THAT AND WE USE THAT TO CALCULATE PRIMARILY STUDENT ELIGIBILITY WHICH IS OF COURSE OUR MAIN FUNCTION. AND THEN THE STUDENT CHEN OR WAN HEY THERE CAL GRANT OR ONE OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS. AND FROM THERE ON I WILL SAY THAT OUR ACCESS TO THE DATA AS A STATE AGENCY. IS LIMITED AND I SAY THIS NOT IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER TO THE SMARTER COLLEAGUES AT THE INSTITUTIONS ARE THE SEGMENTS. BUT BECAUSE THERE'S AND THERE HASN'T BEEN A LONGITUDINAL DATA BASE THAT INCORPORATES INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL AID OR ANY SORT OF STATE POLICY ABOUT THAT DATA. WE QUITE HONESTLY DO STRUGGLE WHEN WE ARE ASKED BY LEGISLATORS SUCH AS YOURSELVES BY OUTSIDE RESEARCH GROUPS THINGS LIKE WELL WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES OF FINANCIALLY DOES THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. HELPS STUDENTS GRADUATE AS A STUDENT WHO RECEIVES A CAL GRANT MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO GRADUATE ON TIME THE STUDENTS SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCE WHO DIDN'T RECEIVE A CAL GRANT. IF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION LEVEL ANYWAY WE DON'T RECEIVE GRADUATION DATA ON WHETHER A STUDENT THAT WE'RE PAYING HAS GRADUATED FROM THEIR COLLEGE UNIVERSITY OR HAS TRANSFERRED -- WE KNOW WHEN THEY STOP GETTING PAID A CAL GRANT. BUT CAL GRANT HAS A FOUR YEAR LIFETIME ELIGIBILITY LIMIT SO THAT COULD EASILY BE A STUDENT AND WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THE STUDENTS. WHO IS TAKING A LITTLE LONGER TO GRADUATE BUT HAS EXHAUSTED THEIR CALVIN ELIGIBILITY FROM THAT POINT ON WE DO NOT HAVE INFORMATION AT THE STATE AGENCY LEVEL ABOUT THAT STUDENT? ANOTHER LIMITATION ON OUR DATA -- TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK HAS TO DO WITH RACE AND ETHNICITY OF ALL THE THINGS THE FAST SO DOES COLLECT IT NO LONGER COLLECTS INFORMATION -- SELF REPORTED ON STUDENTS RACE OR ETHNICITY AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST -- THAT INTEREST IN KNOWING -- ABOUT HOW STATE FINANCIAL AID IS OR IS NOT DISTRIBUTED IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER I MEAN OBVIOUSLY OFFICIALLY SPEAKING WE ARE. A RACE NEUTRAL IN TERMS OF HOW WE DISTRIBUTE IT BUT WE ARE UNABLE TO RELIABLY REPORT AGAIN AT THE STATE LEVEL INFORMATION ON THE DISBURSEMENT -- THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCIAL AID BASED ON RACE OR ETHNICITY THEY DON'T YOU DON'T EVEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN PERMITTED -- TO OF TERRA FORM BASIS FOR EXAMPLE KEEP. BLIND DATE IS TO RACE AND ETHNICITY IN TO KNOW WHO'S APPLIED. THAT'S CORRECT A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DREAMER POPULATION WHICH IS -- A SMALL SUBSET OF THE STUDENTS WE SERVE MOST STUDENTS FELT THE FEDERAL APPLICATION TO GET STATE AID THERE'S NO SEPARATE CAL GRANT OR STATE CALIFORNIA APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND SO WE'RE SORT OF SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF WHATEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES OR DOES NOT INCLUDE ON THE FAST THAT SO THAT'S THE THAT IS CORRECT -- BUT WERE AWARE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT AND I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE HAVING SOME TYPE OF EITHER LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM OR JUST SORT OF STATE POLICY. AROUND DATA AND DATA SHARING -- IT WOULD REALLY HELP IN TERMS OF THE WAY XIN HELP US NO -- WHAT POPULATIONS WE MAY OR MAY NOT NEED TO TARGET MORE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL-CAL GRANT AID TO STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN -- HAVING INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THOSE STUDENTS. GRADUATION OR ON TIME COMPLETION OF RATES ARE AFFECTED BY THE RECEIPT OF FINANCIAL AID WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL TO US IN KNOWING HOW TO EVALUATE SUCH A PROPOSAL WELL PRESUMABLY THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THAT HEY THAT AND PROVIDE REPORTS. THAT'S CORRECT INTERNALLY THE QUESTION IS YOU JUST DON'T GET THE REPORT THAT'S CORRECT AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT AT ALL DUE TO ANY SORT OF MALFEASANCE ON THE INSTITUTIONS PART IS JUST DUE TO THE FACT THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN. PART OF THE PROCESS OR THE SYSTEM UNTIL NOW WE DO OBVIOUSLY ENGAGE ON A ON A ONE TO ONE SORT OF CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH INSTITUTIONS AND SEGMENTS WE HAVE MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING WITH -- ALL OF THE SEGMENTS HERE AT THE TABLE TODAY AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO GET VARIOUS DATA BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN POLICY WISE IS. COULD A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM OR SOME SORT SORT OF STATUTORY EXPECTATION OF THE LEGISLATURE HELP AUTOMATE SOME OF THOSE PROCESS SEES SO THAT WHEN WE GET ASKED FROM LEGISLATORS OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESEARCHERS WHOEVER IT IS. HEY HOW IS A HOUSE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AFFECTING. THE THE MOVE TO INCREASE THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE AT CSU -- I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WE DON'T HAVE TO REACH OUT TO MEET THEM AND NOT A CONCERN AS WELL AND SAY LET'S SET UP A FORMAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. AND HAVE ALL THE ATTORNEYS GO OVER AT AND CHECK ALL THE BOXES THE WE CAN COLLECT THIS DATA AND THEN YOU KNOW SEVERAL MONTHS OR WHO KNOWS MAYBE EVEN YEARS LATER WE'LL BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK. ON THAT METRIC I THINK THAT HAVING A SYSTEMOR A POLICY IN PLACE -- ALONG THESE LINES COULD. REALLY AUTOMATE THAT AND ENABLE US TO PERFORM OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY AS STEWARDS OF OVER TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER FUNDS. TO REPORT ON HOW THOSE PROGRAMS ARE OR AREN'T WORKING OR COULD OR COULD NOT BE IMPROVED SO. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT YOU ALL SEE YOU? WITH REGARD TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM SOMEWHERE IN HERE HERE I WAS READING ABOUT STUDENT IDENTIFICATION. OF NUMBERS -- VERSUS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND HOW ALL THAT WORKS -- SUMMER REQUIRED SOMEWHERE REQUIRED IN. SUMMER VOLUNTARY AND IF YOU START AT THE VERY BEGINNING YOUR QUESTION ABOUT GEOMETRY WE CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT OPPORTUNITIES CHILDREN ENGAGED IN BEFORE THEY ENTERED KINDERGARTEN. THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR THIRD GRADE SCORES THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO MOVE THROUGH THEIR COURSE WORK AND ACTUALLY TAKE THAT AND THEN BE SUCCESSFUL IN EITHER A CAREER. THAT'S VIABLE OR IN COLLEGE RIGHT NOW SO. IF YOU GO BACK MAP IT AND LOOK AT EQUITY THERE IS ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY GAP SO HOW WE'RE CAPTURING THOSE EARLY LEARNING YEARS AND NOT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THAT WE KNOW HAPPENS. THERE'S RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THE IMPACT OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AROUND OPPORTUNITIES THAT IS ACTUALLY DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. SO THE MORE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT COLLEGE READINESS MEANS BEING ABLE TO GO BACK AND SAY WHERE WHERE THOSE CHILDREN FOR EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCES WHAT QUALITY LEVELS FOR THOSE EXPERIENCES AND THEN HOW DO WE REALLY. INVEST IN THOSE COMPONENTS OF IT WHICH WHICH WE THEN SEE HELP PROMOTE THOSE THIRD GRADE READING SCORES IN MATH SCORES WHICH AND PROMOTE THEIR ABILITY TO APPLY TO COLLEGE. AND BE SUCCESSFUL SO IT STARTS IN AS WE SAY WITH OUT THAT CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS THAT HELP THEM CREATE THAT VERY COMPETITIVE INTERNATIONAL WORKFORCE. SO IS THE ISSUE PUTTING A MARKER ON THESE YOUNG PEOPLE A NUMBER OR SOMETHING HOW TO HOW DO WE DO THIS. HAVING THAT A UNIQUE ID IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG PIECE OF IT HAVING A STRONGER DATA SYSTEM THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT THE UNIQUE ID INTO AS A COMPONENT OF IT. AND DINE OUT MY COLLEAGUE OVER HERE ALSO MENTIONED -- THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER SERVICES SO A LOT OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT ARE IN OUR PROGRAMS ALSO HAVE SNAPPED THERE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN OTHERS TO NOT ONLY OUR FAMILIES HAVING TO APPLY. MULTIPLE TIMES TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY WE THEN AREN'T ABLE TO CONNECT THOSE FAMILIES ACROSS THE SERVICES. SO IF THEY WERE IN A HOME VISITING PROGRAM IF THEY HAD A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING THOSE THINGS DON'T CONNECT ACROSS FUND TO ACTUALLY CREATE A PICTURE OF THE WHOLE CHILD. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT CHILD'S LIFE SO WE CAN DETERMINE WHERE TO MAKE BETTER INVESTMENTS WE INVEST A LOT OF MONEY. BUT HOW WELL DO WE INVEST IT THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU INTO WE HAVE SOME OF THE BETTER DATA TO BE ABLE TO LINK CAN SORT OF CARRY THROUGH IN A LONGITUDINAL WAY. WHAT POINT IS A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER ASSIGNED TO A PARTICULAR STUDENTS AND AND HOW FAR IN THIS IT ALONG THE SYSTEM DOES IT? CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE STUDENTS BEFORE WE SHIFT TO A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IF IF AT ALL SO AND WHEN CENTER CAN A GARDEN OUR PRE K. IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO STUDENT IDENTIFIER. AND IT'S AN IDENTIFIER CARRIES ITH THEM AS LONG AS THEY'RE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AT THE K. TWELVE SEGMENT MODEL WE'VE. ALSO ARE GOING TO BE BEGIN COLLECTING AS THEY RELATED HARD TOLD -- EDUCATION STUDENTS THROUGH THAT SAME IDENTIFIER -- IN IN THIS NEXT SUMMER THOSE FOR COLLECTING DATA ON OUR SIX POINT TWO MILLION KIDS THREE MILLION KIDS -- EVERY YEAR WE KNOW A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEM BECAUSE OF THAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT BUT WE ALSO ARE ABLE TO MATCH THAT DATA. NOT USING THE STEPS TO IDENTIFY BUT USING THINGS LIKE NAME AND AND BIRTH DATE WITH -- AGENCIES -- SUCH AS DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WE KNOW WHO ARE CONSIDERED FOSTER YOUTH UNDER THEIR AUSPICES. SAME THING WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO DETERMINE FREE AN ELIGIBLE FREE ENTERPRISE ELIGIBLE MALES SO STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN AND TELL US OR HAVE A PARENT FILL OUT AN APPLICATION WE ALREADY DIRECT CERTIFY THEM. AND THEN ANOTHER -- PIECE OF WHICH WE DO DIRECTOR OF CASE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THIS AT THIS AGENCY AT ALL BUT TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION WE ACTUALLY KNOW MORE ABOUT WHERE OUR TEACHERS ARE TEACHING BECAUSE WE'RE COLLECTING THAT DATA WERE AS A COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING IS COLLECTED ABOUT THEIR CREDENTIAL. SO WE HAVE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS THAT ARE TRAINED AS TEACHERS AND GIVING THEM BACK INFORMATION BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT DATA VERSUS -- AND AGENCIES A TO THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION ONCE YOU ONCE YOU. COLLATOR COMPILED THE DATA. USING NAMES AND BIRTHDATES BECAUSE THESE OTHER AGENCIES DON'T HAVE A STUDENT IDENTITY. THE APPLICATION NUMBER ASSOCIATED. IT'S IN YOUR SYSTEM. VISIT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEN HAVE ACCESS THROUGH THIS DO NOT IDENTIFIER. TO THAT DATA CENTRE SO WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THAT COMMITTEE COLLEGES ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THAT AS STUDENTS ARE APPLYING TO THE COMMUNICATIVE. THEY ARE -- PINYIN AGAINST OUR DATABASE TO ENSURE THAT THE THE NUMBER THAT THEY ARE IN PUTTING ISN'T IS IS THE ACCURATE -- NUMBER WE HAVE AT HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OTHER SEGMENTS ABOUT THAT -- BUT BUT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THAT YOU LEVEL AND THEY WERE ABLE TO ADD IT TO THEIR APPLICATION THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAS BEEN RECEIVING THAT DATA -- FROM FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I JUST DID THIS TO ADD TO CITIES OUT OF WITH A SECURITY NUMBERS OF THE K. TWELVE DOES NOT COLLECT SO SECURITY NUMBERS WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS WAGE DATA AS A RESULT OF THAT. SO WE ARE EXPLORING -- THROUGH A A AND REMOTE WITH THE COMMUNICABLE EDGES ON HOW TO ACCESS WAGE DATA. VIA AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHERE THEIR STUDENTS THEY'RE ABLE TO OBTAIN NATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO SECURITY NUMBERS BUT BECAUSE BAUER-KAHAN DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. THERE IS -- AVOID -- FOR K. TWELVE STUDENT POPULATION WHETHER NOT THEY IF THEY WENT TO COLLEGE AGAIN WE CAN GRAB IT FROM SOMEBODY LIKE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IF THEY DO NOT GO TO COLLEGE AND GO STRAIGHT INTO THE WORK FORCE. WE DO NOT HAVE INFORMATION. YEAH I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT KINDS OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS WAY TO INTEGRATE INFORMATION IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR THE DATA THAT WE END UP HAVING WE DO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE THE STUDENT ID THAT COMES IN ITSELF REPORTED AND I CAN EASILY MAKE A TYPO WITH. WITH WHAT I INPUT -- SO WE TEND NOT TO USE IT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO VALIDATE WHETHER WHAT IS STUDENT PUTS IN IS AN ACCURATE IDEA. ABOUT WE USE -- SEVERAL OF THE MEANS TO DO IT -- SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BECAUSE OF THE PRIVACY THINGS WITH IT BUT WHEN WE GET DATA FROM ET DE IT IS A KEY SOURCE. AND WE USE ALL OUR PRIVACY MEANS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT -- WE ACCESS DATA THROUGH OTHER SOURCES LIKE THE NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE WHICH GIVES US INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. STUDENTS ATTEND OTHER INSTITUTIONS WHETHER OUR UNDERGRADUATES GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL WITH THAT WE USE AT WHAT WE CALL IN TECHNICAL TERMS A FUZZY MATCH -- AND THAT IS -- A LOT OF THE INFORMATION AND THAT MY COLLEAGUE OVER HERE'S MENTIONED NAME BIRTHDATE AND OTHER INDICATORS WE GET A VERY GOOD MATCH WITH THAT KIND OF PROCESS -- I'M SURPRISED ABOUT HOW GOOD IT IS -- BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO COLLECT IT BUT HAVING A MEANS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT I CAN IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. WITHOUT THAT A KEY WAY FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IS TRICKY SO WELL ONE MORE BENEFIT I GUESS OF AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS. YOU COULD IN FACT GO TO CD AND AND VALIDATE MY VERIFY THE STUDENT AID. UNIQUE STUDENT IDENTIFIER. AND THEN HAVE ACCESS TO THE C. D. BODY OF INFORMATION REGARDING OUR STUDENTS AND AND THERE IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE -- IN THE WRITE UP OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GUIDANCE INITIATIVE WHICH THERE ARE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE THAT ARE THAT PROGRAM WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY ALLOWING. IT IS INTEGRATED WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SEE ISSUES APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION SO THAT STUDENTS ACADEMIC RECORD AND THEIR SSID ERROR STUDENT IDENTIFIER ISSUED BY CD COMES TO US ELECTRONICALLY THE STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE. TO MANUALLY KEY THAT -- SO THOSE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES I THINK ALSO -- A FORTNIGHT A HUGE AMOUNT OF OF PROMISE AS WERE TALKING AT RIGHT NOW THAT'S ONLY ABOUT 15% OF OUR APPLICANTS ARE SUBMITTING FROM DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THAT INTEGRATED OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW -- BECAUSE THAT ALSO VALIDATES THE DATA IT'S THE DATE OUR CAMPUSES ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER BE ADMISSION PLACEMENT ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WERE WE'RE DEPENDING ON THE THE QUALITY OF THATDATA AS IT'S COMING FROM OUR K. TWELVE PARTNERS -- VERSES MUCH OF THE INFORMATION THAT SET THE STUDENT PROVIDE THAT THE POINT OF APPLICATION ITSELF REPORTED -- SO THAT'S ALSO A REALITY OF OF STRONGER INTEGRATION NOT JUST FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS HAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. BUT REALLY ALL SERVE TO THE BENEFIT OF STUDENTS AS THEY'RE MOVING THROUGH ALL OF OUR ARE DIFFERENT -- ARE IFFERENT SEGMENTS OFTEN SIMULTANEOUSLY AS AS BEEN TALKED ABOUT SO THERE ARE SOME PROMISING EXAMPLE CCJ BEING ONE OF THOSE WHERE WE WE'VE ALREADY MADE THAT CONNECTION IT'S NOT EVEN A MATTER OF VALIDATING IT'S REALLY COMING WITH THE STUDENTS RECORD. AND THEN WHAT WE'VE DONE SOME SIMILAR THINGS WITH THIS DO NAY COMMISSION AS WELL. YOU ASKED ABOUT CHALLENGES SO JUST WANTED TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT -- THREE YOU KNOW I THINK SETTING UP THE RULES ABOUT WHO USES THAT FOR WHAT PURPOSES THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACCESS FOLKS HAVE TO THE DATE I THINK IS IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT TAKE WORK -- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS PAUSES FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND TIME. IS VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS AND I AM NOT -- AGENCIES COUNCIL BUT MY SENSE IS OUR COUNCIL SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WITH OTHER ATTORNEYS FROM OTHER AGENCIES WORKING THROUGH IT -- YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF OF THESE LAWS AND SO I THINK -- THAT IS BEEN A BARRIER. AND I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD UNDERESTIMATE KIND OF KNOW OUR METHOD IS PRODUCING AMMO USE. ROGER BUT PROJECT OR ENTITY BY ENTITY THAT IS WORKLOAD -- AND WE MANAGE IT BY WE GET REQUESTS WE HAVE A SET OF PRIORITIES THAT -- YOU KNOW TODAY ARE LINKED TO OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS SO WE LOOK AT A REQUESTED WE SAY YOU KNOW IT'S GOING. TO A YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE REQUESTS TOGETHER WILL REQUIRE MORE OF OUR TIME THAT WE CAN PUT TO THIS SO WHICH OF THESE DATA REQUEST BEST SUPPORTS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS -- THAT MAY NOT BE THE OTHER YOU KNOW THE OTHER AGENCY MAY COME TO THE CONVERSATION WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF PRIORITIES. AND IF IT DOESN'T -- IF IT DOESN'T ALIGN WITH OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR US TO JUSTIFY PRIORITIZING THAT AGENCIES EDITOR. AND OF COURSE THAT'S A THAT'S A PROBLEM OR AN ISSUE THAT. IS ASSOCIATED WITH STOVE PIPE. TO OPERATIONS RIGHT I MEAN SO THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION ONE OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT LIKE FOR YOU TO TALK TO ME ABOUT AND PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS A IN THIS PROCESS. IN LOOKING AT THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION CENTRALIZED VERSUS I THINK THE WORD YOU ALL USES FEDERATED BUT SEPT SEPARATE SYSTEMS. LINKED. BUT I'M GONNA AB MAYBE JUST ROUND OUT THE LAST QUESTION I CAN AND TRANSITION THIS BUT CERTAINLY -- HI MY COLLEAGUES WAY AND I DON'T THINK -- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE TALKED ABOUT CAN BE UNDERSTATED -- DOCTOR BROWN MENTIONED THE THE DATA SECURITY DATA PRIVACY AND NOT ONLY IS THE CHALLENGE OF BRINGING OUR ATTORNEYS TO THE CONVERSATION INTERPRETATION. BUT IT'S ALSO A CONSTANTLY SHIFTING -- ENVIRONMENT -- IN TERMS OF THE SECURITY THAT'S NECESSARY WHAT'S HAPPENING -- OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT AND TO A TWO FOR EXAMPLE -- LAWS THAT ARE ARE IT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IF WE HAVE STUDENTS THAT HAVE ENTERED -- SO THERE ARE CONSTANTLY NEW AND EMERGING CHALLENGES IN THE DATA SECURITY DATA PRIVACY FRONT AND I THINK. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL AND AND TO CHRISTIANS POINT I THINK SPEND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME ON IT WILL HAVE TO ALSO BE VERY MUCH A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. AND ALL OF THE DATA USAGE THE TYPE OF QUESTIONS BUT ALSO THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN PRIVATE -- ADDRESSING PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONCERNS BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WORK THROUGH I THINK ON A DAILY BASIS -- ACROSS THE BOARD AND ALL THE STATEMENTS YOU HAVE HERE WE'RE PRETTY SENSITIVE TO THE YEAH SURE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY -- IN TERMS OF YOU CENTRO VERSUS FEDERATED AYE I WOULD ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY CALLING DOCTOR BROWN AND IN TERMS OF I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE'S PROBABLY A COMMON SET OF OF ELEMENTS THAT WE WOULD WANT TO BEGIN WITH AND THAT MAKES SENSE TO BE -- AS A COMMON SYSTEM THAT IT THAT THAT WERE ALL USING ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT COULD BE AUGMENTED OVER TIME -- SO PERHAPS WE START WITH THAT SORT OF CENTRAL REPOSITORY OF OF A COMMON SET OF DATA TAT HELPS LOOK LONGITUDINALLY ACROSS -- A CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE AND WE BUILDING NEXT IT IS BECAUSE URGING NEW WE'VE WE'VE NAMED ALL TYPES OF AGENCIES THAT ARE AT THE TABLE TODAY -- THAT ALSO ULTIMATELY I THINK WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING A PART OF THE CONVERSATION SO I THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT TO START WITH AS A A IS A STATEWIDE EFFORT AND THEN WE CAN ADD TO THAT IS AS TIME PROGRESSES. WELL BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN TYPES OF DATA THAT. EVERYBODY WOULD USE. AND THEN THERE'S DATA. THAT MAY BE UNIQUELY UTILIZED BY YOU SEE OR BY SEA ISSUE. EVEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES K. TWELVE AND SO THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO BE. IN THE COMMON POT. AT LEAST INITIALLY. SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT ANY OTHER ANY YES MA'AM I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE THINK ABOUT A FEDERATED VERSUS CENTRALIZED IT IS IT'S GOING% BACK TO THE DATA QUALITY ISSUE AND YOU'RE GOING. TO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF DATA QUALITY AT WHEN YOU'RE CLOSEST TO WHERE YOU'RE COLLECTING YOUR DATA FROM. SO WITH A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE ARE CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW IMPLEMENT CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE VALIDATIONS MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUBMITTING -- DATA THAT IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE -- BUT IF YOU TAKE THAT PIECE THE WAY YOU YOU YOU BRING IT UP ANOTHER TWO LEVELS YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE STE FURTHER DISTANCING YOURSELF FROM THE STUDENT. FROM THE TEACHER FROM THE THE ADMINISTRATOR AND FROM THE DISTRICT AND SO WE SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME MAKING SURE THAT DISTRICTS ARE LOOKING AT THE DATA PRIOR TO SUBMITTING TO A SAINT ARE YOU REALLY SURE THAT YOU'RE GIVING US A 100% -- ATTENDANCE RATES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH DID HAPPEN IN OUR FIRST OUR FIRST YEAR SO. AT SITE AT I WOULD -- I WOULD LEVERAGE THAT THERE ARE PIECES OF AND WHERE THEY COME FROM -- YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF IT AT HIGH SCHOOL HE ATTENDED I'M A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM AND THEIR PROGRAM BUT THERE ARE OTHERS SUCH AS WHAT THEY HAD FOR LUNCH TODAY THAT THAT EVEN THE DEPARTMENT ISN'T QUITE IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO WHAT WE DO AND SO WE THINK ABOUT. STARTING WITH WHAT A QUESTION A PROBLEM MARIE TRYING TO SOLVE I THINK WE GET BETTER AT FIGURING OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE. ON THE INVESTMENT THE STATUS MADE IN EACH OF OUR DATA SYSTEMS TODAY AND ESPECIALLY ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS STORY THAT WE STARTED OFF A LITTLE BUMPY BUT WE'VE BEEN A SUCCESS STORY IN AND TALKING ABOUT -- HOW TO PUT OUT A DATA SYSTEM THAT IS FUNCTIONING AND -- IS WORKING ABLE TO PULL DATA FROM IT ON ON A REGULAR BASIS WELL BUT AND THERE CERTAINLY HAVE TO BE QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS IN THE PIPELINE BUT AS THE DATA MOVES THROUGH BOOK. THROUGH THE PIPE BEFORE IT LEAVES THE THE PARTICULAR PIPE IT'S AN WHICH WOULD BE K. THROUGH TWELVE OR K. TWO FOURTEEN THEY HAVE TO BE DEBT CHECKS ON THE QUALITY THE DATA BEFORE DUMPS OUT. INTO THE LARGER. SYSTEM OF WHATEVER IT IS MY QUESTION MY CONCERN CENTRALIZED VERSUS FEDERATED IS WE'VE WE'VE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF AND MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE HERE BUT WE'VE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY. ON THE LARGER STATE LEVEL TRYING TO CONNECT DIFFERENT SYSTEMS YEAH -- I THIS IS MY FIRST RODEO HEARING THE CASE SUBCOMMITTEE BUT I SPENT SIX YEARS. DEALING WITH STATE IT PROJECTS IN THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH FUN SO I WAS JUST I'M JUST WONDERING IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE TO DO HIS FEDERATED APPROACH AND I SUPPOSE MY OUR NEXT PANEL WILL ADDRESS THAT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK. SORRY I THINK WE MIGHT ENDUP WITH SOMETHING ONE OPTION IS IS A BLENDED KIND OF PLAN I THINK IT'S RIGHT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE HAVING THAT SET OF A KEY QUESTIONS THAT YOU WANT THE DATA THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT STARTING WITH THAT WILL GIVE YOU A WAY TO SEE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING IT IN SIMILAR WAYS THAT WILL MAKE SENSE IF YOU COMBINE. THEM TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN YOU GO SEE TRENDS THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEN THE QUESTION IS DO I WANT TO EXPAND WHAT I'M COLLECTING CENTRALLY OR DO I WANT TO WORK IN A FEDERATED WAY TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION OF THE DAY. AND THEN -- GO FROM THERE SO SO I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN A SMALL BUILD IT. BUT SEE WHAT YOU GET AND THEN -- SEE OTHER QUESTIONS COME BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT TAKES TO MAINTAIN. AT THE SYSTEMS THAT YOU END UP CREATING -- AM I EVEN DO THAT WITH THE TEN CAMPUSES THAT WE HAVE THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS TAT WE COLLECT CENTRALLY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WERE THEN I RELY ON THE CAMPUSES BECAUSE THEY'RE BETTER SET TO ANSWER THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ABOUT ACTUALLY IS VERY SIMILAR -- DATABASE WHICH IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW TO ANSWER THE ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY THIRTY SIX AND W. I. YOU A CHAPTER FOUR WE ARE TALKING BUT STUDENTS LONGITUDINAL DATABASE BUT DEBT IS FOR THE WORK FORCE. IT IS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. AND IT IS CALLED CROSS SYSTEM ANALYTICS AND ASSIST ASSESSMENT FOR LEARNING AND SKILLS ATTAINMENT. THE CATSKILLS PROJECT AND THERE ARE THE PARKING DATA PARTNERS ON LIKE ARE ELEVEN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. AND DAY INCLUDING ADD DEPARTMENT OF THREE HAVE GOT FLASH GOT GOD WORKS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CAREER TECH EDUCATION STATE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. SO WHY I'M MENTIONING THIS ONE ACTUALLY THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF CHALLENGES TO CREATE THAT DAY ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT. WHAT ARE THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO CREATE WHAT FORCE METRICS DASHBOARD AND ONLY? AB MERGER PROGRAM PARTICIPATION EFFECTIVE TRACKING UP OR DISPENSED AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE ON A CAR ACCOUNTABILITY SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LONGITUDINAL DATABASE. SO THEY IF IT CAN BE CONSULTED WITH THEM ACTUALLY AND I I A 2% DDT AND THAT ON THAT PROJECT SO THAT CAN BE CALIFORNIA'S SING THE RESULT YEAH [inaudible] SIR. ONE LAST THING -- THE CENTER TO ANSWER YOUR QUEST TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION ABOUT CENTRALIZED VERSUS FEDERATED OR DECENTRALIZED -- I THINK. IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL AID ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS TO WHAT EXTENT DO WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE OUR STATE FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS INITIAL CALLS AFFORDABILITY AS EXISTING ON AN ISLAND AS A SEPARATE ISSUE BY ITSELF THAT IS TO SAY. IF ONE VIEWS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE STERN A COMMISSION IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM UNDERSTATE THE FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS AS LITERALLY JUST GETTING MONEY INTO STUDENTS HANDS. WELL THEN FOR THE MOST PART AND I SAY FOR THE MOST PART BECAUSE WE HAVE SEVERAL MORE HOURS I COULD. TALK ABOUT -- VERY VERY IN THE WEEDS ISSUES THERE BUT FOR THE MOST PART THAT'S HAPPENING WE GET AN APPLICATION FROM CERTAINLY PROCESSOR ELIGIBILITY. THEY ARRIVE AT CALVIN ELIGIBLE CAMPUS AND WE ONE OF THE THE THINGS THAT I THINK A CENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEM COULD DO IS. HELP WITH THESE OTHER QUESTIONS BECAUSE I JUST GET THE SENSE -- FROM HAVING BEEN MY MINERAL TWO AND A HALF YEARS AS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE COMMISSION THAT LEGISLATORS AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDER AREN'T JUST INTERESTED IN. YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST IN MORE THAN JUST HOW GOODA JOB YOU DO GETTING MONEY INTO THE STUDENTS' HANDS IT'S HOW WHAT ELSE TO THE STE WHAT ELSE IS THIS YOU NEED TO SUCCEED HOW YOU KNOW HOW WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE STUDENT. WHAT OTHER NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE TO WHAT EXTENT CAN THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM PLAY A ROLE IN LEVY EATING FOOD AND SECURITY HOUSING -- IN SECURITY HOMELESSNESS AMONG STUDENTS I THINK THAT. AS LONG AS WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AS BEING MORE THAN JUST ABOUT HOW DO WE GET A CHECK INTO STUDENTS HAND BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE WHOLE STUDENT. IS CARED FOR AND HAS WHAT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED THEN IT SEEMS TO ME AND THIS IS JUST MY OPINION NOT SPEAKING FOR THE COMMISSION HERE THAT MAKES A PRETTY GOOD ARGUMENT FOR SOME TYPE OF CENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEM. RIGHT. OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE MOST THORNY PRIVACY ISSUES PROBABLY OF ANYBODY -- EXCELLENT PANEL FINANCE -- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE PANELS. NO QUESTIONS BUT JUST FROM JUST SOME THOUGHTS TO REITERATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- I THOUGHT THIS PANEL DID A REALLY NICE JOB OF KIND OF HIGHLIGHTING YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS THAT WERE OUT THERE IN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST -- CHALLENGES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED I MEANT THAT THIS PANEL -- UNIT REITERATED CHALLENGES LIKE IN THE SYSTEMS ARE OPERATING UNDER DIFFERENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE OFTEN USING DIFFERENT DATA DEFINITIONS. AND THERE'S A VARYING DEGREE OF CONNECTEDNESS AND USER FRIENDLY USER FRIENDLINESS -- ENDED MINISTRATION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH YOU WHEN YOU'RE STAFF AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN A ROOM I'M ON THIS PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES GOING FORWARD. WELL I AGREE EXCELLENT PENALIZED THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE CONVERSATION I LOOK FORWARD. TO MEETING IN SPEAKING WITH YOU AS WE MOVE DOWN THIS. PANEL NUMBER. THREE THAT WAS INTERESTING. COME ON DOWN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IF I COULD ASK YOU TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD STARTING MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT. MA'AM. MY NAME IS VALERIE [inaudible] HELLO. THANKS FOR JOINING US I'M CALLING FOR AND I'M THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE EDUCATION. CENTER FIVE MINUTES. WERE YOU HEARD OUR DISCUSSION SO YEAH. WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST? THAT'S GOOD OKAY. OKAY -- I YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU ROB AND OTHER MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I THINK THAT I'M PROBABLY MORE EDUCATION IN LIKE MANNER AND I WAS ASKED TO GET COMMENTS TODAY BASED ON RESEARCH I DID A COUPLE OF YEARS. ON CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO TRACKING STUDENT PROGRESS ACROSS K. TWELVE AND HIGHER ED AND ITS NEEDS GOING FORWARD I THINK I GAVE US SUMMARY DOCUMENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO REFERENCE IT WHILE I'M TALKING BUT JUST. I READ THE ONE THAT WAS IN MY PACKET OUT OKAY. WHEN IN DOING REMARKS MAYBE YOU COULD TOUCH ON SOME OF THE ISSUES? YES PHYLLIS I WILL TRY TO DO PREPARED REMARKS THAT I THINK ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I DID MAKE MYSELF NOTES ABOUT LIKE PLACES TO DIVERT. TO TO ANSWER THINGS THAT YOU ASKED SO -- ANYWAY I DID RESEARCH OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS AND I'D LIKE TO START WITH THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF WHAT I FOUND SO WHILE THERE IS NO STATEWIDE CROSS SECTOR DATA SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. THE FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEMS EACH HAVE LONGITUDINAL STUDENT DATA SYSTEMS THAT ARE QUITE GOOD AS YOU HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT -- INCLUDES CAL PAD SYSTEM IT'S AND SICK AT SEGMENTS ALSO HAS A LONGITUDINAL STUDENT DATA SYSTEM. SO THESE SYSTEMS CONTAIN INFORMATION THAT'S VERY VALUABLE FOR UNDERSTANDING STUDENT PROGRESS AN OUTCOME WITH IN EACH SYSTEM. SO THE INFORMATION ARE GENERALLY UPDATED ANNUALLY IN SOME CASES OR AT SPECIFIED POINTS DURING EACH TERM IN OTHER CASES DEPENDING ON WHAT THE DATA IS. AND THEY HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT'S MATCHED TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES SO SEE SACK -- GIVES THE HIGHER END SEGMENTS YOU KNOW SOME FINANCIAL AID RELATED DATA THEY GET MATCHES TO EDT DATA AS YOU ALSO HEARD TALK ABOUT. SO WHAT THESE DATA ARE PRIMARILY USED FOR STATE AND FEDERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. BUT IN RECENT YEARS EACH SYSTEM OFFICE HAS INCREASED ITS EFFORTS TO MAKE IT MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH ONLINE DATA DASHBOARDS AND OTHER REPORTS YOU HEARD THEM MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS THE SALARY ARE FOR AN UC'S INFO CENTER -- THEY SOMETIMES SHARE STUDENT DATA AMONG THEMSELVES TO ADDRESS PARTICULAR NEEDS AS YOU HEARD THEM DESCRIBED. SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING FOR GOOD LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEMS BUT NO CROSS SECTOR DATA SYSTEM. SO I'LL POINT TWO THREE ISSUES. UP FIRST THE INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS IN OUTCOMES IS DISCONNECTED. WELL THERE IS SOME DATA SHARING AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL AS I NOTED AND THERE ARE SOME VOLUNTARY. DATA SHARING EFFORTS ACROSS INSTITUTIONS IN SOME REGIONS. WE HAVE NO WAY TO GET A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE PICTURE OF THE EDUCATION TO WORK FORCE PIPELINE IN CALIFORNIA. SO FROM A BUDGET AND POLICY PERSPECTIVE WHAT THIS DOES IS REINFORCES CALIFORNIA'S VERY STYLISH APPROACH TO EDUCATION PLANNING. OUR SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THE AND LEE AND ACCESSIBLE WHILE I DID MENTION THAT EACH SYSTEM HAS PROVIDE SOME GOOD INFORMATION IT'S OFTEN COMPLIANCE FOCUSED OR FRAMED IN WAYS THAT SUIT THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. SIMILAR INFORMATION IS OFTEN CALCULATED AND PRESENTED VERY DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THE SYSTEMS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR POLICY MAKERS EDUCATORS STUDENTS IN THE PUBLIC TO INTERPRET IT. A THIRD ISSUE IS INEFFICIENCY THE CURRENT APPROACH HAVE A NUMBER HAVE INTO INEFFICIENCIES BUILT INTO IT AND ONE OF THEM KIND OF CAME UP ON THE LAST PANEL. SO AS ONE EXAMPLE WE HAVE MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CONTRACT WITH THE NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE JUST IN AN EFFORT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR STUDENTS WHEN THEY LEAVE SO THIS IS. SURELY A BOON FOR THE STUDENT CLEARING HOUSE BUT IT'S A REAL FAILURE TO LEVERAGE STATE RESOURCES. SO HAVING GOOD INFORMATION THAT'S DISCONNECTED AN INACCESSIBLE WITH INEFFICIENT MEANS OF PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT LEAVES US UNABLE TO ANSWER CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS AND OUT COMES ACROSS SYSTEMS. AND IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVELOP EVIDENCE BASED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT WILL BEST SERVE STUDENTS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH MULTIPLE SYSTEMS. SO YOU ASKED ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS AND ONE OF MY REPORTS I HAD A LIST OF JUST EXAMPLES OF CRITICAL QUESTIONS WE CAN'T NOW ANSWER. SALT GIVE YOU A COUPLE THAT ARE PARTICULARLY POLICY FOCUSED JUST AS EXAMPLES. SO WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES OF CS YOU WHEN YOU SEE TEACHER CANDIDATES AND WHAT IS THEIR READY MISS AND RATE OF RETENTION WHEN THEY CAN BECOME EMPLOYED BY THE STATE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. THAT'S AN ISSUE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS WITH A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM IF YOU INCLUDED -- INFORMATION ALSO FROM THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION. HOW MANY -- WHAT HAPPENS TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WHO MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CS YOU WHEN YOU SEE BUT THEY'RE NOT ADMITTED DUE TO CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS? WHERE DO THEY GO TO THEY GO TO COLLEGE WHERE THEY GO? OUR DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM THERE RIGHT BECAUSE SOMEONE TESTIFIED IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. THEY DON'T CAPTURE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. IN K. TO TWELVE SO IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE THEY GO ON WHAT THEY DO. WE HAVE A PROBLEM RIGHT. AT THE MOMENT WE DO BUT YOU COULD LOOK AND SEE IF. THE STUDENTS WHO WERE SAY DENIED ADMISSION EVEN THOUGH THEY MET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS -- THEY HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED SECURITY NUMBER AS PART OF HAVING APPLIED SO YOU WOULD HAVE IT SO YOU CAN THEN LOOK AND SEE DID THEY GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WITH A MATCH TO THE CLEARING HOUSE DID THEY GO OUT OF STATE DEBATE WITH THE MATCH TO EDT DID THEY END UP GOING STRAIGHT TO WORK AND DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE AT ALL. SO THOSE THOSE ARE KINDS OF THINGS YOU CAN FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS IN THE CSU WHEN YOU SEE SYSTEMS ON ACTUAL STUDENTS. SO YOU KNOW JUST AS ONE MORE EXAMPLE ARE DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE EXTRA FUNDING THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF THEIR STUDENTS WHO ENROLL IN COLLEGE READY TO SUCCEED. WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF BIG STAE INITIATIVES AND POLICIES IN RECENT YEARS WITH VERY LITTLE ABILITY -- TO ANALYZE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE. SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS YOU KNOW THAT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THAT A LONGITUDINAL. DATA SYSTEM COULD ADDRESS. AS TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN DEVELOPING A DATA SYSTEM MY RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THERE LARGELY POLITICAL AND CULTURAL. THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS COMING RATHER LATE TO THE PARTY IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING A STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY HELPFUL IN REGARD TO TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. MOST OTHER STATES HAVE OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING SUCH DATA SYSTEMS WHICH GIVES US PLENTY OF EXAMPLES TO LEARN FROM AS PAM BROWN MENTIONED EARLIER. THE STATES HAVE ALREADY FACED ISSUES LIKE MATCHING RECORDS WHEN K. TWELVE AND POST SECONDARY HAVE DIFFERENT STUDENT ID'S OR FIGURING OUT MECHANISMS TO MAINTAIN DATAPRIVACY AND SECURITY THERE ARE PLENTY OF REPORTS TO READ AND EXPERTS TO CONSULT TO UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE LESSONS FROM THOSE STATES. TO OUR OWN CONTEXT. THE BIGGER CHALLENGES ARE IN DECIDING WHAT BASIC TYPE OF DATA SYSTEM TO DEVELOP AND IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE LEADERSHIP FOR THE EFFORT. SO DO WE URSUE A TRADITIONAL STATEWIDE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES CONNECTING THE RECORDS ACROSS THESE FOR SYSTEMS THAT W ALREADY HAVE. THIS IS THE APPROACH USED IN OTHER STATES AND IT HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF LEVERAGING CALIFORNIA'S CONSIDERABLE EXISTING INVESTMENTS. AND REQUIRING A FAIRLY SHORT TIME LINE TO DEVELOP AT A MORE REASONABLE COST. SOME ARGUE THAT INSTEAD CALIFORNIA SHOULD TRY TO DEVELOP A DATA SYSTEMTHAT INVOLVES MORE FREQUENT UP LOADS OF INFORMATION. THAT WOULD COME FROM INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL BUT ONE THAT COULD BE USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS AS THEY TRANSITION ACROSS INSTITUTIONS I BELIEVE CHRISTIAN REFER TO THAT AS MAKING SURE WE'RE SERVING LOCAL PRINTER OF LOCAL PRACTITIONER LANDS. IN A DATA SYSTEM. SO WHILE THERE ARE PROMISING LOCAL AND REGIONAL EXAMPLES OF SUCH SYSTEMS THERE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS IN CONSIDERING THEM AS THE MODEL. FOR THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF A STATEWIDE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF LARGER TECHNICAL BARRIERS GREATER COSTS IN AN EXTENSIVE TIME FRAME BEFORE COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE DATA MIGHT BE AVAILABLE. SO IF CALIFORNIA DECIDED TO PURSUE AT LEAST AS AN INITIAL APPROACH A MORE TRADITIONAL STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM. THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE WOULD SEEM TO INVOLVE DECIDING ON A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. OTHER STATES USE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES MY RESEARCH ENDED UP CONCLUDING THAT CALIFORNIA MIGHT BEST BE SERVED BY ESTABLISHING A STATE DATA AGENCY OR A DATA OFFICE WITHIN SOME EXISTING STATE AGENCY. THAT HAVE THE SPECIFIC MISSION OF DEVELOPING A CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE PRODUCING STANDARD REPORTS AND DATA TOOLS FOR VARIOUS AUDIENCES AND MANAGING ACCESS TO THE DATA. AND PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONCERNS OF COURSE THIS STRUCTURE WOULD ENSURE THAT THERE'S AN ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THIS DONE. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SEGMENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPATING AGENCIES OF COURSE BUT IN NEUTRAL ENTITY WITH CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S NOT TIED TO A SPECIFIC SEGMENT. THE STRUCTURE WOULD ALSO SUPPORT EXPANDING THE DATA SYSTEM TO INCLUDE DATA FROM PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES. EARLY LEARNING OR OTHER AGENCIES OUTSIDE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEMS AS YOU HEARD EXPRESSED A LOT OF INTEREST IN DOING. SO FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN SITTING ON A LOT OF EDUCATION DATA WITH NO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE OUTCOMES OF ITS INVESTMENT ACROSS PUBLIC EDUCATION. THE STATE'S WELL POSITION NOW TO JOIN MANY OTHER STATES IN USING DATA WE ALREADY COLLECT. TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT CN INFORM STUDENT DECISION MAKING SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND MEET THE GOVERNOR'S VISION OF USING DATA TO IMPROVE AND A LINE STATE EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE POLICIES I THINK WE SHOULD SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW SOME OTHER STATES. HAVE USED THEIR DATA SYSTEMS GO WE NEED TO GO WE NEED IS A CENTRAL [inaudible] OFFICE. TO TO MANAGE THIS THE THIS OPERATION EVEN WHETHER OR NOT THIS THE DATA COLLECTION IS CENTRALIZED OR WHETHER IT'S FEDERATED I I THINK YOU DO YES YOU NEED A GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE WHETHER YOU DECIDE ON A CENTRALIZED DATA. WAREHOUSE US RIGHT NOW SYSTEM OR A FEDERATED SYSTEM I THINK YOU WOULD STILL NEED A CENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS TO SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DO THE COLLECTION WHETHER IT'S THE INITIAL COLLECTION OF THE COLLATION AND THEN SOMEBODY NEEDS TO MANAGE THE OUTPUT. YES. AS TO WHAT THE PRODUCT IS THAT YOU'RE DELIVERING AND WHO YOU'RE DELIVERING IT YES I COUNTY AS OF THE TIME I DID THERE THE RESEARCH -- THAT I READ UP IN THE REPORTS. OF THE STATES THAT HAD. CROSS SECTOR DATA SYSTEMS. MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY CHOSE TO GO WITH A CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE RATHER THAN A FEDERATED SYSTEM THE NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT BUT THAT MOST OF THEM HAD TO DO WITH GREATER EFFICIENCY -- THEY ACTUALLY GET USED MORE BECAUSE THE DATA ARE ALREADY MATCHED AND ALREADY SITTING TOGETHER IN A IN A WAREHOUSE MAKING IT MUCH EASIER TO ACCESS THEM -- YOU HEARD -- THE PEOPLE IN THE LAST PANEL TALK YOU PROCESS AND YOU KNOW EVERY TIME THEY WANT TO LIKE SHARE DATA FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE IS THIS LONG DRAWN OUT PROCESS OF GETTING APPROVAL AND AND USE AND THAT KIND OF THING SO IF YOU HAVE A CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO HAVE A STRUCTURE AS PART OF YOUR GOVERNANCE WHERE. THERE IS DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. ON HOW TO USE THE DATA EACH TIME YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT -- BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ALREADY THERE TOGETHER -- SAID THAT OTHER STATES MORE OTHER STATES THAN NOT HAVE DECIDED TO GO WITH THAT. WELL MY LIMITED I. T. EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA TELLS ME WHEN YOU'RE ATTEMPTING. TO CONNECT DISSIMILAR SYSTEMS THEY'RE ALWAYS CONNECTIVITY ISSUES AND THAT USUALLY IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO SOLVE IF YOU EVER SOLVE IT. BUT WHAT ABOUT A BIGGER ISSUE WITH A FEDERATED SYSTEM AND IT WAS WITH. BUT OF COURSE ONE OF THE PANELISTS IN THE WAS -- DOCTOR BROWN. SPOKE ABOUT YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN DATA POINTS CERTAIN LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HAVING AND THEN THERE'S PROBABLY OF SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER. DATA SET THAT WOULD BE UNIQUE TO THE UC OR THE C. ISSUE WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO IT'S A CENTRALIZED STUFF. THERE WE NEED TO GET INTO A POT SOMEWHERE. EITHER FED THERE OR COLLECTED THERE INITIALLY RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YES YES I MEAN I I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH HER THAT THERE ARE THAT YOU KNOW THE EACH SYSTEM OFFICE. COLLECTS. A SUBSET OF WHAT THE ACTUAL INSTITUTION TAP INSTITUTIONS HAVE MORE DATA THAN THEY SEND UP TO THEIR SYSTEM OFFICES I THINK SIMILARLY. THE SYSTEM OFFICES WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SOME PIECES OF INFORMATION IT WOULDN'T GET SENT UP TO ANY CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE JUST BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY NEEDED. ROUTINELY TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS AND THAT SO YOU COULD HAVE SORT OF UP A MIX OF THINGS A LOT AND SOME STATES HAVE THAT WHERE THEY HAVE A CENTRALIZED. DATA WAREHOUSE FOR A SUBSET OF OF PIECES OF INFORMATION AND THEN IF YOU WANT SOME OTHER INFORMATION THEN YOU GO OUT AND YOU ASK THE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE THAT OR THEY HAVE A CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE FOR EDUCATION DATA. BUT THEY HAVE A FEDERATED SYSTEM WITH SAY SOCIAL SERVICES OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORK ONLY IFTHEY NEED IT DO THEY GO OUT AND DO A MATCH AND GET RECORDS FOR THE PURPOSE THEY NEED. I THOUGHT THE COST THE COST -- INFORMATION DETAILS IN YOUR COURSES LOW. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO BE MUCH HIGHER WELL THERE IS THAT I DID NOT DO AN IN DEPTH COST ANALYSIS SO I WOULD CAUTION YOU AGAINST THAT WHAT I DID DO IS IN ALL OF MY INTERVIEWS I ASKED PEOPLE ABOUT NATIONAL EXPERTS PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES TO GIVE. ME ESTIMATES ON LIKE WHAT WOULD IT COST TO DO THIS PEOPLE JUST KIND OF ROUTINELY FORMED AROUND DAY I THINK IT WOULD COST CALIFORNIA TWO OR THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. TO HAVE A SYSTEM AGAIN. YOU KNOW AND I AND I DID A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE LIKE WHEN DID SEE PAC COST NOT THAT THEY DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS THIS BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT. COMES IN IF YOU INFLATE THEIR COSTS TO NOW SOMEWHERE IN THE TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLAR RANGE. BUT AGAIN THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW MUCH YOU WANTED TO RESOURCE IT. pTHAT'S NOT LIKE THE INITIAL COSTS TO PAY YOU KNOW ALL THE SYSTEMS TO LIKE BE INVOLVED IN FIGURING OUT WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO HERE AND WHAT PIECES OF DATA ARE GOING TO GO IN IT AND HOW DO WE DEVELOP OUR PRIVACY. AND SECURITY PROTOCOLS AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF THAT'S AN INITIAL COST BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW WE MEASURE. AND EVALUATE WHAT WE DO. ACROSS THE BOARD AND AT THE END WE DON'T HAVE DATA TO PERMIT THE ANALYSIS TO HELP SO. RIGHT VERY INTERESTING THANK YOU [inaudible] MA'AM. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON -- AGAIN MY NAME IS VALERIE LINDSAY WAGNER AND I'M HERE WITH -- CALIFORNIA COMPETES I'M A SENIOR ANALYST THERE -- APPRECIATE BEING INVITED -- TO BY THE COMMITTEE -- AND YOUR STAFF -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT FINANCE AND SENDING -- CALIFORNIA COMPETES WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN RECOGNIZING THAT HIGHER EDUCATION CAN BE BOTH AN ANTIDOTE AND A VACCINE. TO INCOME INEQUALITY WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT. ODJICK THAT FOCUSES ON MAKING THE ECONOMIC IN EQUITY DRIVEN CASE FOR INCREASING DEGREE ATTAINMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WITH A POST SECONDARY DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE OUR STATE NEEDS A STRONGER GRASP OF NOT ONLY WHAT STUDENTS EXPERIENCES ARE IN HIGHER ED. BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH EARLY A. K. TWELVE AND THE WORK FORCE WE'RE EXCITED FOR CALIFORNIA TO CATCH UP WITH THE PROGRESS THAT MANY OTHER STATES HAVE MADE BY MORE SYSTEMATICALLY INTEGRATING. DATA TO BETTER SERVE POLICYMAKERS THE PUBLIC AND STUDENTS BOTH YOUTH AND ADULTS. I'LL START BY SHARING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I THINK IN EDUCATION WORK AND WORK FORCE OR P. WORKFORCE THE TO SYSTEM SHOULD DO IN CALIFORNIA AND WHY ONE IS NEEDED. HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR EARLIER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE COULD GET IF WE HAD THE SYSTEM -- AND THEN I'LL CLOSE WITH DESCRIBING SOME. OF WHAT I THINK WE BELIEVE OUR NEAR TERM IMPLEMENTATION STEPS THAT CAN SET THE STATE ON A PATH FOR EFFECTIVENESS COST SAVINGS AND ULTIMATELY INDIVIDUAL AND SHARED PROSPERITY. SO A P. WORKFORCE DATA SYSTEM I THINK CONCEPTUALLY SHOULD DO FOUR THINGS ONE DRIVE IN SUPPORT STATE LEVEL EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC GOALS. TO CONNECT EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DATA AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. IRV AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY FOR UP TO DATE AND HISTORICAL EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DATA. AND OVERCOME HISTORICAL INDEPENDENCE CHALLENGES THAT LIMIT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO USE EXISTING DATA. THERE ARE FEW WIDELY AGREED UPON CONSIDERATIONS THAT EMPATH. EMPHASIZE WHY THE STATE'S CURRENT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING NOTHING METHODS ARE INADEQUATE -- I APPRECIATE WHAT ALL MY COLLEAGUES OF SAY IN IN GENERAL SORT OF WE SUPPORT THEM I THINK WE HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE ON THEM. SO I THINK FIRST THE LACK OF COORDINATION LANDSCAPE IS KEY AND THAT REALLY CAME UP I THINK IN THIS LAST -- PANEL. AS COLIN NOTED AS DETAILED IN YOUR AGENDA FOR THIS HEARING WE SAW CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC ENTITIES MAINTAIN THEIR OWN DATA SYSTEMS PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES MAINTAIN THEIR OWN DATA SYSTEMS AS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- AS DOES THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT RATE. THE WHILE EACH INDEPENDENT EACH ENTITY INDEPENDENTLY HOLDS RICH DATA I THINK IT'S CALLING SUGGESTED -- IN HER SORT OF OPENING RIGHT THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS HAPPENING THIS SEGMENTED APPROACH LIMITS UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EDUCATION AND WORK FOR SYSTEMS COMPLEMENT EACH OHER. AND REALLY WHAT THAT DOES IS IT REDUCES POLICY MAKERS ABILITY TO MAKE FACT BASED DECISIONS. AND PREVENT STUDENTS FROM BEING INFORMED CONSUMERS. SECOND THE CAPACITY IN COSTS REQUIRED TO CONNECT THE SILO DATA ARE WHAT I WOULD CALL HER TO LEAN. I'M COLLEEN TALKED ABOUT THE NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE AND THAT'S CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT PLACE WHERE LOTS THEY GET A LOT OF BUSINESS FROM CALIFORNIA. THE STATE SPENDS TENS OF MILLIONS EACH YEAR TO DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY SUPPORT MARY A DATA SYSTEMS AND I'M GONNA ALSO THROWING PORTALS AND DASHBOARDS -- ONLY SOME OF WHICH ARE EVEN PRESENTED IN THAT AGENDA TODAY THERE'S MORE. MY THIRD POINT CENTERS ON EQUITY. SO THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. YOU KNOW VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND SOME EVEN MORE SO LIKE THAN WHAT I THINK PEOPLE GENERALLY START WITH. IS LIKE A FACT THE STATE NEEDS DATA ON WHERE STUDENTS AND WORKERS ARE STRUGGLING AND WHICH INVESTMENTS CAN ALLEVIATE THE STRUGGLES AND MAXIMIZE SUCCESS. THE ABSENCE OF AN INDEPENDENT DATA SYSTEM PREVENTS COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF OPPORTUNITY. PROGRESS MONITORING AND INFORMED DECISION MAKING. IN FACT THE STATE'S MAJOR INVESTMENTS AND CROSS SECTOR AND CROSS ARMS. SECTOR IN SEGMENT COLLABORATION OF SUCH A SYSTEM IN A PREVIOUS ROLE A LEAD SOME RESEARCH -- ON THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S CAREER PATH FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CANCERS OFFICE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. EACH REGION. CONSIDER DEVELOPING THEIR OWN NEW REGIONAL DATA SYSTEM AND ALL HAD THE SAME STRUGGLES SUCH AS WHICH DATA SYSTEMS ARE THE BEST. FOR UNDERSTANDING REGIONAL PATHWAYS WHO HAD ACCESS TO THOSE DATA AND OF THOSE WITH ACCESS. WHO ALSO HAD THE CAPACITY IN THE INTERPRETERS DATA? THEIR PROGRESS VERY BASED ON LARGELY ON RESOURCES AND THAT ALONE I BELIEVE SHOULD NOT DETERMINE HOW I'M LEADERS ARE INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO USE INFORMATION. A P. WORKFORCE DATA SYSTEM COULD HELP DEMOCRATIZE HOW DID ARE ACCESSED AND USED BY VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING STUDENTS. THE GIVEN THIS INFORMATION WHERE DOES THE STATE GO FROM HERE. FIRST AND FOREMOST THE STATE MUST DECIDE ON SOME FUNDAMENTALS THAT I THINK. MY COLLEAGUES. MOST OF THE SECOND ISSUE TODAY THAT WE'VE COVERED -- HAVE MENTIONED SO WHAT WILL THE SYSTEM BE USED. FOR WHAT WILL THIS HOW WILL THE STATE LOOK DIFFERENT AFTER WE HAVE THE SYSTEM. WHICH SECTORS WILL BE INVOLVED. WHO WOULD BE THE CONSUMERS OF THESE DATA? THE NEXT STEP IS TO RESEARCH DATA POLICIES AND PRACTICES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS HOW POLICY HAS BEEN USED TO FRAME PLAN. AND IMPLEMENT P. WORKFORCE DATA SYSTEMS ACROSS THE NATION. I PROVIDED YOU WITH THE HAND OUT ATTACHMENT A THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT T COMPARES IT REALLY JUST SUMMARIZES VERY BRIEFLY -- WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MARYLAND KENTUCKY -- IN WASHINGTON STATE. UNDERSTANDING THE WORK OF OTHER STATE AND IMPORTANTLY HOW THAT WORK CAN BE APPLIED TO OUR POLICY CONTEXT IS CRITICAL THE TYPE OF POLICY LETTERS I THINK WE SORT OF HIGHLIGHT -- ON THAT DOCUMENT. AND THIS BRINGS US REALLY TO MY NEXT RECOMMENDATION THE STATE SHOULD PLAN TO DEVELOP THE CENTRAL DEPOSITORY REPOSITORY FOR DATA. THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS PORTALS AND DASHBOARDS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WORKERS RESEARCHERS AND LEADERS IS A LITTLE BIT MIND BOGGLING. A CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY WOULD BE MORE WOULD MORE EQUITABLY PROVIDE STAKEHOLDERS WITH ACCESS TO CONSISTENT AND COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION. IT WOULD ALSO HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SIX AND REALITIES OF WHAT WE CALL ZIP CODE DESTINY. FINALLY THE QUESTION OF WHERE THIS -- P. WORK FIRST DATA SYSTEM SHOULD BE HOUSE IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THIS ISSUE OF COORDINATION. TO GAIN TRUST IN BY IN OF ALL PARTICIPANTS THE STATE MUST STORE THE DATA IN A WAY THAT IS POLITICALLY NEUTRAL SECURE AND ENSURE THE BALANCE OF POWER IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE'S GOALS. WE ARE GLAD THAT THERE ARE OTHER POLICY CONVERSATIONS UNDER WAY TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY THAT COULD OVERSEE DATA AS ITS MAIN CHARGE. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I THINK THAT YOU SORT OF ASKED WHAT WHAT WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF THIS THOSE. QUESTIONS WE COULD PROBABLY ANSWER ARE HOW MANY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ENROLLED IN COLLEGE THE NEXT FALL. WE DON'T KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW. HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS GOING TO COMPLETE COLLEGE? WE ARE NOT THAT RIGHT NOW. HOW DO JOB PLACEMENT RATES AND WAGES LOOK ACROSS INSTITUTIONS IN MAJORS? WATER WORKFORCE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS DEPENDING ON THEIR TIME TO DEGREE. THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES BUT REALLY IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST WHAT. WE BELIEVE ARE CRITICAL SERVE NEAR TERM IMPLEMENTATION STEPS THE FIRST THE STATE COULD MAP OUT EXISTING DATA INFRASTRUCTURE IDENTIFYING WHICH SYSTEMS ARE IN USE WHERE THERE ARE GAPS IN WITH SCALING UP STATEWIDE MEANS. MAPPING CAN CLARIFY AND HELP ENSURE THAT THE DATA SYSTEM GOALS ARE MET. THE STATE SHOULD IDENTIFY THE DEED IN METRICS NEED TO MEET SYSTEM GOALS. WE SHOULD ALSO DETERMINE WHO WILL COMPRISE THE COMMITTEE CHARGED WITH PLANNING AND LAUNCHING THE DATA SYSTEM. SEVERAL ENTITIES. WANT TO AND PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE A VOICE IT INDEPENDENCE IS KEY TO ENSURING A SENT A STUDENT CENTERED APPROACH. FINALLY THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER MORE THAN ONE PROTOTYPE OF THE P. WORK FOR SYSTEM. THESE PROTOTYPE SHOULD ADDRESS HOW DATA WOULD FLOW FROM THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL AND BACK. EVERYBODY GET SOMETHING AND IDENTIFY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO CONNECT TO OTHER STATE AGENCY DATA. OF COURSE IT SHOULD ALSO DELINEATE COSTS -- ON BECAUSE I THINK ONE THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. IS REALLY ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE BIG PICTURE AND WHAT WE WANT. RIGHT IF I WANNA GO GET A CAR. I COULD GET IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HONDA CIVIC OR I COULD GET A TESLA RATE SO DECIDING COST A FRIEND I THINK SOMETIMES CAN BE A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE FOR NOT REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT IT IS WE THINK WE WANT. FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S AN EXCITING TIME. TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL OF A P. WORK FIRST DATA SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE EAGER TO SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP SUCH A SYSTEM IN OFFER EXPERTISE AS YOU REFINE A STRATEGY THAT MORE EQUITABLY EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. AS WELL AS FAR STATES BROADER ECONOMY. EXCELLENT DOCTOR THANK YOU I'VE REALLY APPRECIATED AND BUT IN BOTH CASES OF THE THE RESPONSE TO WHAT WE GET OUT OF THIS THAT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE. FOR ME FINANCE ANY QUESTIONS PARTICULARLY. AGAIN NO QUESTIONS -- BUT JUST A STATEMENT -- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD DOES CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN ORDER FOR THIS DATA SYSTEM TO REALLY REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL I'M IS DEVELOPMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO INVOLVE A REAL COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND FROM THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ROOM AS WELL AS THE RESEARCHERS SOME OF FROM WE'VE. HEARD FROM TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THAT CONVERSATION EXCELLENT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. PUBLIC COMMENT TO ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WHILE OKAY. LOC. AND PRETTY.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TODAY IS A RICH DISCUSSIONS THERE ARE SEE WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY FIRST WE WANTED -- TO I WANTED TO KIND OF SPEAK ON IN SUPPORT OF TWO CORE AREAS THAT WERE DISCUSSED TODAY SO FIRST WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. THAT TRACKS THE STUDENTS FROM EARLY EDUCATION FOR THE WORK FORCE WITHOUT SUCH A SYSTEM AS YOU HEARD EARLIER. WERE REALLY EIGHT UNABLE TO ANSWER CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO STUDENT PROGRESSION AND I'M IDENTIFY HOW SYSTEMS ARE MEETING OUR WORK FORCE NEEDS -- WHERE CALIFORNIA'S HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES APPLYING TO ENROLLING IN COLLEGE ONCE THEY'RE THERE HOW LONG DO THEY TAKE TO COMPLETE AND HOW DO THEY USE THEIR FINANCIAL AID -- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION ON THAT AND WOULD ASK THAT YOU -- INSURE A SYSTEM THAT IS CENTRALIZED INDEPENDENT AND THAT DATA IS TRANSPARENT TRANSPARENT ACCESSIBLE AND ACTIONABLE. ADDITIONALLY WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT SEATS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR OF AT THE CSU WE WOULD URGE YOU TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN. THE FUNDING FOR TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS AT THE CSU AND TO PAIR THAT WITH ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT SLOTS AT THE UC IN ORDER TO MEET THE GROWING STUDENT DEMAND -- AND OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM NEXT. THE AFTERNOON ALEX GRAVES OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPRESENTING OVER EIGHTY OF THE NONPROFIT ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE. I JUST LIKE TO MAKE TWO BRIEF POINTS FIRST ON THE CONVERSATION A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM -- WE ARE REALLY HAPPY TO SEE IN MONEY -- TO MOVE FORWARD ON THAT -- WE BELIEVE LUNCH TILL DATA SYSTEM WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR HELPING POLICYMAKERS -- CRAFTED POLICY FOR HELPING INSTITUTIONS CRAP BETTER POLICY THE BETTER SERVE STUDENTS AND ALSO WILL PROVIDE. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PERMISSION TO STUDENTS FAMILIES ADVOCATES IN THE PUBLIC -- COLLECTVELY OUR SECTOR PRODUCES ABOUT 20% BACHELOR'S DEGREES OVER HALF OF THE MASTER'S DEGREES IN OVER HALF OF THE DOCTOR DEGREES. AND SO IT'S CONVERSATIONS MOVE FORWARD WE WON'T BE HERE TO SAY THAT WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ARE SECTORS INCLUDED IN CONVERSATIONS AROUND A LOGICAL DATA SYSTEM. WE WANT TO BE PART OF THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ALL MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN INTEGRATE OUR IN SECTOR INTO THAT SO THAT FOLKS HAVE A FULL PICTURE -- OF OF ALL OUTCOMES ACROSS ALL INSTITUTIONS. AND I APOLOGIZE IF THIS WAS MENTIONED DURING THE PANEL I WAS OUT IN THE HALLWAY BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN INVOLVED -- WITH OUR PUBLIC COUNTERPARTS THROUGH A GRANT FROM THE BILL MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION AND HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH FOR OVER A YEAR NOW -- MANY OF THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AROUND HOW THIS WOULD LOOK AT HOW WOULD FUNCTION. SO WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD -- TO TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL. VERY BRIEFLY ON THE OTHER POINT. EARLIER THERE WAS MENTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AROND SUPPLEMENTAL CAL GRANT DOLLARS PER STUDENT PARENTS -- AS IT'S PROPOSED THAT WOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS PARENTS ATTENDING PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND WE FEEL THAT SHOULD THAT PROPOSAL MOVE FORWARD WE'D LIKE TO SEE LOW INCOME STUDENT PARENTS ATTENDING OUR INSTITUTIONS TREATED EQUITABLY. SO THAT IF YOU'RE A STUDENT -- IN THAT SITUATION WE KNOW THAT THE BARRIERS YOU FACED A FINISHING YOUR DEGREE OR SIMILAR REGARDLESS OF THE INSTITUTION YOU GO TO JAIL AND SO WETHER YOU GO TO UC RIVERSIDE OR UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS. I WE WANNA MAKE SURE THOSE STUDENTS ARE SUPPORTED EQUALLY THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. NEXT YES MA'AM.

FOR THE CONVERSATION BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE NEED PART OF THAT PROCESS AND AND OFFER OUR ASSISTANCE IN IN MAKING SURE THEY ARE -- I ALSO WANT TO THANK MS BECAUSE EMMA'S FROM THE CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION FOR RAISING THE ISSUE OF NOT HAVING THE CTC THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING DATA AS PART OF THIS CONVERSATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKFORCE OUR TEACHER WORKFORCE IS A PRETTY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. PARTICULARLY ARE LOOKING AT SHORTAGE AREAS LIKE BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND AND SPECIAL ED AND SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE MAKING TO TO TO FILL THOSE GAPS -- JUST I WON'T WELL I'LL BE BACK TO TALK MORE ABOUT OUR LETTER BUT JUST A AN OVER ARCHING THEME FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR TEACHERS. THE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT THE POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT YOU OFTEN BUILDING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL REELS SEVERAL YEARS BUT WHERE WE SEE GAPS IN INVESTING IN MAKING SURE THAT THESE THINGS ARE IMPLEMENTED LIKE. THAT LIMITATION OF THE ENGLISH LEARN A ROADMAP AND PROFESSIONAL SUPPORTS FOR TEACHERS WHO ARE WHO ARE LEADING OUR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS SO YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM NEXT SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON. SHARE ROTH. MY NAME IS SEASONAL KANSEN -- ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND A PROFESSOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT CAL STATE SACRAMENTO. THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THE OVERALL FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE CSU. HOWEVER WE REQUEST THAT -- THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BE SET ASIDE TO HIRE NEW TENURE TRACK FACULTY IN THE CSU. THIS MONEY WOULD RESULT IN A PRO APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED NEW FACULTY. THIS REQUEST WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE CSU TO PROVIDE AN ALLOCATION PLAN BY OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAVE PROVIDED COMMITTEE STAFF WITH BUDGET LANGUAGE FOR THIS REQUEST. THE LACK OF ACCESS TO FULL TIME TENURE TRACK PROFESSES HARMS THE STUDENTS WHO RELY ON CSU FOR QUALITY PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. TURNOVER AMONG LECTURE FACULTY AS HIGH AS THE MOST. NATURALLY SEARCH FOR LONG TERM STABLE TEACHING POSITIONS. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO HIRE TENURE TRACK FACULTY FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED NEW FACTORIES. SYSTEM WIDE. THIS WAS A GREAT STEP FORWARD BUT NOT ENOUGH. THE REQUESTED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS REFLECTS A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE BASED ON LAST YEAR'S. A NEW ONGOING FUNDING SO WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THAT AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US COME BACK AND SEE IS WHEN WE DO THE SPECIFIC ITEMS. YES SIR GOOD AFTERNOON MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION WE DO HAVE THREE PROPOSALS TO OF THE OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AND AND STUFF DOES HAVE THE SPECIFICS ON THAT. ONE IS ON TENURE TRACK ONE IS ON MENTAL HEALTH AND ONE IS ON AND ROLL MEANT -- I DID WANT TO COVER THE ENROLLMENT PIECE VERY BRIEFLY WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. 42% ENROLLMENT INCREASE HOWEVER GROWTH BE MEASURED BY HEAD COUNT INSTEAD OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING IS ACTUALLY SPENT ON ACCESS WHY DO WE ASK THAT. LAST YEAR CSU TURNED AWAY THIRTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS THIS FUNDING WOULD ENSURE -- MORE QUALIFIED STUDENTS GET A SEAT AND THE CSU -- WITH THESE FUNDS THE CSU COULD PAY FOR EITHER SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED F. T. E. STUDENTS OR EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE STUDENTS BY HEAD COUNT -- USING OF TEA -- CALCULATIONS ALONE WHICH ARE BASED ON HOW MANY SEATS ARE UNITS OR CLASSES STUDENTS TAKE THE CS YOU CAN USE ENROLLMENT FUNDS TO GET CURRENT STUDENTS TO TAKE MORE CLASSES. INSTEAD OF GIVING STUDENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE TURNED AWAY A SEAT IN THE CSU. THE CSU IS DOING THIS. THIS YEAR WITH TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET FUNDING. WE BELIEVE THAT AND WOMAN GROWTH FUNDING SHOULD GIVE. ACCESS TO NEW STUDENTS AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED TO PAY FOR CURRENT STUDENTS TAKING MORE CLASSES -- LIKE FOR EXAMPLE TO GRADUATE AT GRADUATION STUDENT -- INITIATIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU FOR JOINING US JUST MA'AM. EMILY ROSENBERGER WAS SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION I THAT'S WHEN I HIGHLY IS FUTURE HEARINGS REYES CFA THE TO PURSUE HEAD COUNT -- I SEE TENURE TRACK OF FUNDING AND WE ALSO WANT TO SEE AN EQUITY ON THE CSU SIDE FOR MENTAL HEALTH WE THOUGHT FOR THE UC BUT WE DIDN'T SEE IT FOR THE CSU AND THEY ACTUALLY ARE UNDER THE RATIO THAT ARE RECOMMENDED. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'RE HEARING A LOT FROM STUDENTS WE DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BEAR THE COST OF THE RISING -- EXPENSES THAT CS YOU BUT WE ALSO THINK IT'S UNFAIR FOR OUR WORKERS TO TAKE THAT COST ON THE SUPPORT STAFF AT THE CSU HAVE LOST OR STEPS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX HAVE NOT RECEIVED THEM AND WE'RE ASKING FOR A HUNDRED MILLION. TO MAKE THEM WHOLE AND BRING THEM UP ON IN VERSION ISSUE THANK YOU WE'LL LOOK INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY REQUESTED IN THE B. C. PIER NOT BUT WILL CHECK ON THAT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON WELL AS THAT OF THIS MY VALLEY KINCAID WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATE. AND WE APPLAUD THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY AROUND BASIC MEANS WE KNOW THAT IF STUDENTS ARE HUNGRY OR DON'T HAVE A WARM SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP IT AFFECTS THEIR ABILITY TO DO WELL. AND ULTIMATELY COMPLETE COLLEGE -- AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM IT WILL ALLOW EDUCATION OFFICIALS TO MEASURE STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND% THE BARRIERS. OF FROM PRE K. THROUGH COLLEGE GRADUATION A WORKFORCE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF STATES WITHOUT A SYSTEM LIKE THIS IN THE WORKS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON THESE ISSUES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING. ANY FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. WELL I THINK THIS I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR ATTENDING THIS WAS A GREAT HEARING FINANCE THANKS FOR PARTICIPATING LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER. DISCUSSIONS ON THESE SUBJECTS. HEARING NOTHING ELSE THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED
