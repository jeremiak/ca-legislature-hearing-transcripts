00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.607
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A UNIVERSITY

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:52.409
PROFESSOR AN EDUCATOR FOR FORTY

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.678
EIGHT YEARS. AND THEY SAY EVERY

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:56.680
TIME I OPEN MY MOUTH I'M ALWAYS

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.448
TEACHING FOLKS SOMETHING. IT'S

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:01.885
IN MY DNA IT'S WHO I AM. AND SO

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:03.220
I FIND IT DIFFICULT NOT TO.

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:04.855
HOPEFULLY SHARE SOMETHING WITH

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:07.524
YOU THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT AS I

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.026
THINK ABOUT THE EIGHT YEARS

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:10.727
THAT WE HAVE HAD A CONVERSATION

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:13.163
HERE ABOUT BLACK HISTORY. I

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.797
THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:16.066
TALKED ABOUT. I THINK BE

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:17.601
CONSTANT EFFORT TO SAY TO YOU

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:19.736
OVER AND OVER HOW IMPORTANT

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:22.105
HISTORY IS IN AMERICA. THAT IT

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:24.074
IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTER

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:25.609
IS NOT JUST THE GIVING OF

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.811
INFORMATION. BUT IT'S REALLY

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.346
THE SHAPING OF THE PEOPLE WHO

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:31.582
LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND AS A

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.618
RESULT OF THAT ONE'S INCLUSION.

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:37.020
AND ONCE EXCLUSION FROM HISTORY

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:38.922
SPEAKS VOLUMES BUT THAT

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:40.958
INDIVIDUAL AND FOR THEIR FAMILY

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:41.458
AND WHO THEY ARE IN THIS

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.594
COUNTRY. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.995
THAT AND WE ASK OURSELVES THE

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.897
CONSTANT QUESTION WHY IS THIS

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:49.032
EXCLUSION STILL THERE. WE HAVE

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.300
TO ASK WHAT WAS THE INTENT IN

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:51.435
THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:54.271
SOLUTION. AND AS WE LOOK AT IT

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:55.839
THEN WE CAN SEE THE IMPACT THAT

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:56.807
IT HAS ON PEOPLE'S

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.408
POSSIBILITIES AND

00:47:58.475 --> 00:47:59.910
OPPORTUNITIES. AND THEIR

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:01.245
CHILDREN'S POSSIBILITY IN

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:04.147
OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE'VE HAD SO

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:04.715
MANY DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:07.718
THAT. I'VE ALSO ASK YOU TO

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:08.418
WONDER WHAT THE WORLD WOULD

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.354
LOOK LIKE. IF WE HAD KNOWN

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.422
CERTAIN BITS OF HISTORY. IF WE

00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:14.992
HAD KNOWN ABOUT THE HIDDEN

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.494
FIGURES. WOULD WE BE SO

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:19.696
CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN BEING IN

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:21.198
STEM BECAUSE WOMEN WOULD

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:23.233
PROBABLY ONLY STEM. AND SURELY

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.402
WOMEN OF COLOR WOULD OWN STEM

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.371
IN OWN SCIENCE. SO THE LACK OF

00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:28.739
THAT INFORMATION- THAT

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:30.307
MISINFORMATION OF NOT BELIEVING

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:32.042
THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:33.777
A ROLE IN MATHEMATICS AND

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:36.079
SCIENCE. HAS CAUSED US TO SPEND

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:37.281
LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY OF

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:39.316
TRYING TO TELL WOMEN YOU CAN DO

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:41.885
MATH. YOU CAN DO SCIENCE. WHEN

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:44.921
THEY THE OWNERS OF IT. AND THEY

00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:45.856
SHOULD BE THE ONES DRIVE IT.

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:47.524
AND WE ASK WHAT WOULD THE WORLD

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:48.659
LOOK LIKE IF WE HAVE CERTAIN

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:51.094
THINGS THAT WOULD BE. AND I

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:52.729
EVEN ASK MYSELF AND MY STAFF

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.097
CONSTANTLY WHEN I'M TALKING

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:55.932
ABOUT HISTORY I WENT RECENTLY

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:58.502
TO SEE. THE MOVIE. AND I CAME

00:48:58.568 --> 00:48:59.536
BACK AND I SAID WHAT DO THINK

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.571
ABOUT IT AS A HISTORIAN I BEGIN

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:02.539
TO TALK ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:04.908
THE MOVIE I THOUGHT IT WAS

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:05.475
ACCURATE I THOUGHT IT WAS A

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:06.977
GOOD MOVIE. AND ONE OF MY

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.078
MEMBERS SAID TO ME YOU KNOW

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:10.113
HOW. THEY HAD A THEY HAD

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.581
FRIENDS WHO DIDN'T LIKE HERE.

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:13.517
THEY SAID WHY. SAID BECAUSE

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:14.551
WHITES HAD A ROLE IN IT AND

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:15.886
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS NOT

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:17.654
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT WHITE

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.656
PEOPLE. WHAT ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:21.425
AND I ONCE AGAIN HAD TO REMIND

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.793
THEM THAT THE HISTORY OF THE

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:25.228
UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. WAS NOT

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:27.030
JUST ABOUT BLACK DETERMINATION

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:29.733
TO BE FREE. BUT WAS ALSO ABOUT

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.802
THE COLLABORATORS THE WHITES

00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:33.804
WHO COULD NOT STAND THE SYSTEM

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.806
AND FOUND WAYS TO PARTICIPATE.

00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:37.207
AND IF THEY HAD KNOWN THEIR

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:39.176
HISTORY AND HAD LOOKED UP A

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:40.911
BOOK LIKE WITHOUT SANCTUARY

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:42.713
ABOUT LYNCHING OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.414
THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN PICTURES

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.582
OF WHITE MOTHERS AND WHITE

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:47.384
CHILDREN LYNCHED ALONG SIDE OF

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:49.353
BLACK INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.054
WERE SYMPATHIZERS. THE WHITE

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:53.190
SOMETIMES RESTED THEIR FAMILIES

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:55.625
THE RESOURCES SIMPLY BECAUSE

00:49:55.692 --> 00:49:57.094
THEY COULD NO LONGER STAND IN

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.862
AN UNJUST SYSTEM. AND IF WE

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:00.964
KNOW THAT. THAT MIGHT MOTIVATE

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:02.766
US SOME POWER TO LOOK FOR OTHER

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.868
COLLABORATORS IN COOPERATORS

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:06.903
AND OTHERS TO STAND WITH US. ON

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.672
ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE SO AND

00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:10.407
JUST. THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.875
SO MANY OF YOU ONE THREE NINE

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:14.144
TWO. BECAUSE 85% MEANT THAT

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:15.679
MOST OF US WERE NOT AFRICAN

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:16.913
AMERICANS WOULD NOT IN THOSE

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.616
COMMUNITIES SOLVE THE INJUSTICE

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.618
AND DECIDED TO STAY AT. IT'S

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:22.686
ALL BECOMES IMPORTANT WHEN WE

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:24.020
TALK ABOUT HISTORY THAT WE HAVE

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:25.522
ALL OF THAT. AND SO AS I THINK

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:26.823
ABOUT WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:30.026
ABOUT TODAY. ABOUT HISTORY. AND

00:50:30.093 --> 00:50:31.695
THEN I HAD TO REMIND MYSELF

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:33.930
WHAT I TOLD YOU LAST YEAR. I

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:36.466
LIVE FOR THE DAY. WHEN WE DON'T

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.735
HAVE BLACK HISTORY MONTH. WHEN

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.370
BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS NO MORE

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:41.805
THAN A HISTORICAL STATEMENT OF

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.241
WHAT WE USED TO DO. THAT WE

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.309
WANT CELEBRATED HISTORY FOR

00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:48.445
JUST A MONTH. BUT LOOK AT IS

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:49.679
NOW. IN THE STATE OF

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:51.681
CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A

00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:54.184
CURRICULUM. THAT ENCOMPASSES

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:56.386
ALL OF CALIFORNIA. THAT REALLY

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:57.854
PROVIDES FOR US THE NECESSARY

00:50:57.921 --> 00:50:59.856
INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:02.058
GROW AND TO DEVELOP. AND I KNOW

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:03.627
THAT SO IT SEEMS LIKE A PIE IN

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:05.495
THE SKY. BUT IT'S SOMETHING

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:07.130
THAT CAN HAPPEN IN MUST HAPPEN

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:09.065
IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO I THINK

00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:11.268
OF THAT BECAUSE I THINK OF TWO

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:11.868
BILLS THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.770
YOU HAVE SEEN. AND I LOOK AT

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:15.071
THE CONFLICT AND THE ISSUES

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:17.174
THAT ARE THERE IN THOSE BILLS

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.309
THAT HAVE NOT COME ABOUT. AND

00:51:19.376 --> 00:51:20.811
WE REALLY MUST ASK OURSELVES

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:22.312
VERY HONESTLY WHAT IS THE FIRST

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.381
STEP WE TAKE. OBVIOUSLY THE

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:25.882
FIRST STEP WE TAKE IS TO

00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:26.817
BASICALLY LOOK AT OUR

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:28.585
UNIVERSITIES AND SAY ARE WE

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:30.253
PREPARING OUR TEACHERS. TO

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.955
EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN SO THEY

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.857
HAVE THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:34.925
HISTORY AND NOT JUST A PIECE OF

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:36.860
IT. AND IT TAKES TIME TO DO

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.962
THAT. BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:41.264
WITHOUT THE FIRST STEP. AND SO

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:42.332
MY GOAL IN TERMS OF BLACK

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:44.634
HISTORY IS HAVING TAUGHT IT NOW

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:45.202
FOR FORTY EIGHT YEARS AS A

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:46.436
UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:47.637
CHAIRMAN DEPARTMENT AT A

00:51:47.704 --> 00:51:49.439
NATIONAL PERSON. DEALING WITH

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.908
BLACK STUDIES. IS TO WORK SO

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.643
THAT WHEN WE TALK OF HISTORY IN

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.879
CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE TALK OF

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:58.048
HISTORY IN THE UNITED STATES

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.950
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF US.

00:52:00.016 --> 00:52:02.452
AND OUR CHILDREN ARE EMPOWERED.

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:03.887
BECAUSE THEY SEE NOT ONLY THE

00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:05.689
STRUGGLE OF ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:08.792
TO BE FREE. THEY UNDERSTAND THE

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:10.460
PRECIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM. AND

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:12.596
THEY ALSO SEE THEMSELVES IN THE

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:15.532
PROCESS OF MAKING IT HAPPEN. IT

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:17.234
IS A THING THAT IS NOW TIME

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.835
THAT WE STOP DOING THE

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:20.570
CELEBRATION ONCE A MONTH. A

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.172
BLACK HISTORY IN CHICAGO

00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:23.607
HISTORY IN WHATEVER THAT WE

00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:25.809
STOP DOING THAT. THAT WE MARK

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:28.011
THIS TIME SAYS THERE WAS A TIME

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:30.080
WHEN WE USED TO DO THAT. BUT TO

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:35.318
DAY. THIS TIME WE DO IT RIGHT.

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:36.620
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I

00:52:36.686 --> 00:52:38.555

HISTORY MONTH. IN THE

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:36.079
INTERVENING YEARS SINCE THE

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:37.480
NINETEEN SIXTIES THE QUEST FOR

AND ALL AMERICANS HAS

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:43.753
CONTINUED. THE CALIFORNIA
