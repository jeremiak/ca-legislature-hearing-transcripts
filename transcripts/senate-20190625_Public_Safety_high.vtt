00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.802
SOME MAY ARGUE THAT ELIMINATING

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.637
COPAYS COULD LEAD TO ENCOURAGING

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.606
PEOPLE TO SEEK MEDICAL VISITS

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.374

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.125
MORE PHANTOM ISSUES YOU KNOW.

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:48.060
THERE MAY BE LAWS THAT SAY THEY

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:49.295
HAVE PEOPLE IN PRISON AFTER WE

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.863
TAKE CARE BUT WE FOR TOO MANY

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.332
HORROR STORIES WHEN IT JUST

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.700
DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.202
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THE QUESTION

00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:59.505
IS WHY DON'T WE PAY PEOPLE --

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:01.173
I'M NOT SAYING IT TO PAYING

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.508
FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR.

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:04.643
BUT EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR I MEAN

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.412
IN SOME INSTANCES NOTHING.

00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:07.846
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD PEOPLE

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.381
UP SO THEY CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:11.016
THEMSELVES WHEN THEY GO BACK TO

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.818
SOCIETY THE NOTION.

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.687
THAT WE WE TELL YOU THE VET YOUR

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:17.723
VALUES EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.390
IS JUST I THINK.

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:20.226
VERY CONTRARY TO THE GOALS THAT

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.694
WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE OF

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.962
ALLOWING PEOPLE AS THEY

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:25.898
EXPERIENCED LIFE INCARCERATED.

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.967
TO REFLECT UPON THE POTENTIALS

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.202
OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF PRISON AND TO

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:31.337
LET THEM KNOW WE VALUE THEIR

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:32.304
WORK.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:35.407
MORE THAN EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR --

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:38.077
IN SO -- I'M GONNA COME IN AND

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:39.011
MOVE THIS BILL US IT'S ALREADY

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.779
BEEN MOVED BUT I I THINK WE'RE

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:42.348
LOOKIN AT THIS THE WRONG WAY I

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:44.383
THINK THESE PEOPLE.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.285
WHO DO WORK SHOULD BE PAID AN

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.053
APPROPRIATE WAGE SO THAT IF THEY

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.256
ARE ASKED TO PAY A COPAY IT'S

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:52.925
COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT OTHERS IN

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:55.628
SOCIETY OR ASKED TO PAY -- UNTIL

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:57.296
THEY COULD AFFORD THAT.

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.530
RATHER THAN HAVE TO DECIDE THE

00:14:58.597 --> 00:14:59.565
GOING TO WAIVE THEIR HEALTHCARE

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:00.766
SO THEY CAN GET A CHRISTMAS

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.868
PRESENT FOR THEIR KIDS THAT THEY

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:04.236
AREN'T ABLE TO SEE ANYWAY.

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:06.872
I THINK THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS A

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.240
MESS.

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:09.341
AND I THINK THAT -- THE A AND I

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:10.209
APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.278
BILL BUT IT'S DEALING WITH THE

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.012
PROBLEM.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.079
YOU KNOW KIND OF AS IT IS AND

00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:15.347
MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO GOING

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.616
FORWARD IS FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:18.884
WHICH THAT WERE THEORETICALLY

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.286
SAVING A LOT OF MONEY.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.488
BY CLOSING DOWN THESE PRISONS

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:25.424
AND A REDUCING ARC ARE RUN --

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.059
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OUR IN

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:29.061
OUR STATE PRISONS I DON'T KNOW

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:30.195
WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING.

00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:32.765
BUT CERTAINLY THE NOTION THAT.

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:35.067
WE PROVIDE PEOPLE EVEN IF IT'S

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.802
TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR -- SOMETHING

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:38.737
SO THAT IF WE'RE ASKING THEM TO

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.739
MAKE A CO PAY -- IT'S SOMETHING

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.308
THAT THEY CAN DO WITHOUT

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.043
WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER WHETHER

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.177
OR NOT THEY'RE GOING.

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.512
TO BE ABLE TO GET PERSONAL

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:48.380
HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS OR WHAT

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.349
HAVE YOU SO -- AGAIN OR NO

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.017
THAT'S NOT THIS BILL IN FRONT OF

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:53.686
US BUT THE NOTION THAT THE

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.754
SYSTEM IS WORKING TRUSTS FINE I

00:15:55.821 --> 00:16:01.093
THINK IS JUST -- IT IS PATENTLY

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.495
FALSE PANDA AND I THINK THAT --

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:04.930
WE WE CAN A NEED TO DO BETTER IN

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:06.498
OUR STE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:08.300
SYSTEM AND THE PEOPLE RUNNING IT

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:09.802
HAVE TO TAKE A MORE HONEST.

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:13.572
AND MORE -- CREATIVE YOU ABOUT --

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.574

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:18.410

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.045
AND PERPETUATING THOSE SAME

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:22.948
THINGS I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.416
TO HELP US OVERCOME THAT SO.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:25.017

THERE WILL BE NO FEE CHARGED.

AN INMATE SHALL NOT BE DENIED

I'M WONDERING IF INSTEAD OF

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:40.993
ELIMINATING THE FEES SAID OKAY

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:41.894
YOUR FIRST VISIT.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.929

IS THAT.

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:59.077
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE OR THROUGH

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.679
THE GERMAN SOMETHING WE'D BE

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:01.747
WILLING TO LOOK AT FOR SURE

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.081
BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.283
COLLECTING REVENUE ARE

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:05.384
PENALIZING SOMEONE WHO IS

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:06.952
SEEKING A MEDICAL VISIT.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.387
IT IS AGAIN A TOOL THAT EXISTS

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:10.456
THAT IS NOT ALWAYS CHARGE AND IN

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:12.124
SOME CASES AS AS THE OTHER POINT

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:12.324
OUT.

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:13.559
THERE SOME COUNTIES DON'T CHARGE

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:14.593
THE FEE AND THEY MADE THAT

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.928
DECISION FOR WHATEVER REASON AS

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:16.995
YOU POINTED OUT IT'S NOT A

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.730
MANDATORY FEE AND SO AGAIN IT

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:20.065
EXISTS AS A TOOL THAT IS

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:20.899
AVAILABLE.

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.601
AND IF THAT SORT OF GRADUATED

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.870
FEE WERE TO BE DISCUSSED I THINK

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:26.038
WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO

00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:27.473
DISCUSS THAT SORT OF OPTION AND

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:28.674
THAT'S THE CHALLENGES.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.175
WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT VARIABLES

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:31.710
IN THE SYSTEM AND THIS IS JUST

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.846
ONE PIECE OF THAT AND THIS ONE

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:35.914
PIECE IS BEING ADDRESSED BY MANY

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.983
OTHER THINGS ARE BEING ADDRESSED.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.853
THANK YOU -- CINNAMON STONE IS

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.522
THAT MAKES.

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.757
ERRORS THAT NOT [inaudible]

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:49.127
DEBATABLE NO THE END EVEN TO

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:49.695
SENATOR JACKSON'S COMMENT.

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:50.429
IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:54.132
COPAYS WORK FOR US OUTSIDE.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:55.501
IT'S MAKING SURE WE'RE PUTTING

00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:56.668
SOME SKIN IN THE GAME WE HAVE A

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.103
MEDICAL VISIT THAT'S REALLY WHAT

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:58.837
THAT'S ABOUT.

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:01.139
WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE THAT'S A VERY

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.308
DIFFERENT CALCULATION BECAUSE NO

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:04.810
PLACE ELSE TO GO YOU DON'T HAVE

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.245
A CHOICE?

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:08.680
AND EVEN IF WE RAISE THE RATES

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:11.617
WHICH I WOULD AGREE EIGHT CENTS

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:12.518
AN HOUR IS IT.

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:13.819
IS A BIT EMBARRASSING THAT'S

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:15.320
WHERE THE STRUCTURE IS AN FOR

00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:15.921
WILLING TO PUT A LOT OF MONEY

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:16.855
INTO IT.

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:18.624
IN FACT THE PRISON SYSTEM IS NOT.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.224
WE'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY THE

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.759
PRISM YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.160
BECAUSE OF INCREASING COSTS

00:19:22.227 --> 00:19:23.595
WE'RE NOT YET CLOSING PRISONS

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:26.064
IT'S DIFFERENT TOPIC THAT SOME

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.432
THAT WE ULTIMATELY NEED TO DO.

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:29.134
BUT UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM.

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:31.069
EITHER WE FIND A WAY TO PAY

00:19:31.136 --> 00:19:32.437
THESE FOLKS A LOT MORE IN THE

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.072
BUDGET WHICH WOULD BE VERY

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:34.806
EXPENSIVE AND I DON'T SEE THAT

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:35.674
COMING.

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:39.111
OR WE WE SORT OF SHIFT WHAT THE

00:19:39.177 --> 00:19:40.979
WHAT THE INCENTIVES ARE IN THE

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.447
SHARES THAT I'VE TALKED.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.249
TO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:45.918
FRIVOLOUS MEDICAL VISITS.

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.319
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY DATA

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.555
ABOUT WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS OR

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.390
HOW MANY PEOPLE COME FORWARD

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:52.257
WITH.

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:53.659
THEY CLAIM TO BE FRIVOLOUS

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:54.960
MEDICAL VISITS.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.029
I'VE TOLD THEM THAT IF THIS

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:57.829
MOVES FORWARD AND THEY START

00:19:57.896 --> 00:19:59.264
SEEING AN INCREASE IN THAT IF WE

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.799
CAN EVEN TO FIND IT I THINK

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.100
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OTHER TOOLS

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:03.602
THAT THEY CAN USE. TO ADDRESS

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.304
THAT ISSUE.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.471
THEY DO SAID CALLS THEY DO

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.840
TRIAGE THEY HAVE OTHER TOOLS AT

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:10.576
THEIR DISPOSAL BECAUSE THIS IS A

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:11.610
CAPTIVE POPULATION.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.312
SO JUST FUNDAMENTALLY CHARGING

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.514
THEM ANYTHING FOR HEALTH CARE

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:17.482
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY AND IT

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.051
PHILOSOPHICALLY I DON'T THINK

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:20.018
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:21.453
SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER INSIDE EVEN

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.554
IF WE ADDRESS.

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.122
THE PRISON PAY.

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.190
AND THERE ARE OTHER MECHANISMS

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:26.758
THAT COULD BE PUT IN PLACE TO

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:28.360
ADDRESS THAT THIS THIS NOTION

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:30.095
THIS FEAR ABOUT ABOUT FRIVOLOUS

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:31.630
VISITS BUT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:32.698
IN TALKING TO THE MEDICAL

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:34.499
PROVIDERS IN PRISONS AND IN

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:35.334
JAILS.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.835
THEY DON'T SEE IT THE SAME WAY

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.004
AT ALL THEY SEE A CO PAY JUST AS

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.306
AN ABSOLUTE BARRIER AND THEY

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:42.975
DON'T SEE THAT THESE ARE THE

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:43.642
ONES WHO ARE TREATING THESE

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:44.543
PATIENTS.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.978
THEY DON'T SEE THESE FRIVOLOUS

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:47.946
AS IT'S THEY DON'T THEY'RE

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.014
TELLING ME THAT THIS IS NOT.

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.049
A PROBLEM IN THEIR MINDS.

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:53.018
SO IF WE THINK THAT PUTTING A CO

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.686
PLACE IN PLACE A COPAY PLACE IS

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:55.687
GOING.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:56.655
TO IS THE BARRIER TO THAT THE

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:58.323
FRIVOLOUS MEDICAL IT DOESN'T

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.625
SEEM TO BE THE CASE.

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:01.426
AND YET THERE'S NOT REALLY A

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:03.295
JUSTIFIABLE REASON FOR IT OTHER

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:05.430
THAN WE HAVE TO PAY ON THE

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:06.098
OUTSIDE YOU SHOULD PAID ON THE

00:21:06.164 --> 00:21:06.999
INSIDE.

00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:08.500
THAT KIND OF FALLS A LITTLE BIT

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:10.469
THIN GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.671
THERE INSIDE AND AND WE'RE NOT.

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.473
SO THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHICAL THING

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:17.275
OF PUTTING THIS ON THEM.

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:19.011
BABY FEELS GOOD BABY CRITICISM

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:20.912
EVEN MORE WE HAVE TO DO IT SO

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:22.080
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:24.216
BUT THOSE AREN'T RATIONAL HEALTH

00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:25.717
REASONS THOSE AREN'T RATIONAL

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.919
POLICY REASONS WE'RE JUST TRYING

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.087
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS

00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:30.889
FUNCTIONING AT YES BITS AND

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:31.890
PIECES AT A TIME.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.392
BUT FUNCTIONING THE BEST THAT IT

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:36.328
CAN AND TAKING DOWN BARRIERS. TO

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:38.430
MEDICAL ACCESS.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:39.698
SO I COME FROM A SUPERMAJORITY

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:43.468
BACKGROUND AND AB ONE OH NINE

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:46.438
SHOWS UP AND I THINK. TWO

00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:47.706
THOUSAND ELEVEN ONE OF THE THE

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:49.775
STAGGERING A REMARKABLE THINGS

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:50.809
THAT WE DISCOVERED IS HOW MANY

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:51.109
[inaudible]

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:52.878
INMATES.

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.446
WERE WERE BROUGHT DOWN TO THE

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:55.781
JAIL SYSTEM.

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:58.050
THAT HAD SEVERE MEDICAL ISSUES

00:21:58.116 --> 00:21:59.551
ON WE WE FOUND OUR COSTS

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.620
INCREASED BECAUSE OF A SAID WE

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:03.755
HAD LIVER TRANSPLANTS AND ALL

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.691
KINDS OF ISSUES.

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:07.426
SO I CAN KIND OF SEE WHERE SOME

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:08.727
SERVICE ARE GOING TO SAY WAIT A

00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:09.761
SECOND I WE'VE GOT.

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:11.029
TO MONITOR OUR COST SO THAT'S

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:12.230
SORT OF THE CONTEXT OF IT BUT

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:13.098
THE ONES LIKE SOME LARGER

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.332
COUNTIES LIKE SANTA CLARA THEY

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:15.400
HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN YEARS

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:16.668
BECAUSE THE COST OF

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:17.969
ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM.

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:19.705
OUTWEIGH THE COSTS OF WHAT

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:21.206
THEY'RE COLLECTING SO AGAIN THEN

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:22.007
IT'S JUST BACK TO THE

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:25.110
PHILOSOPHICAL YOU DO A BECAUSE

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:26.411
WE DO IT.

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.146
I BROUGHT THIS UP WITH -- I'VE

00:22:28.213 --> 00:22:29.381
THREE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:30.148
SO SANTA CLARA WAS ONE SANTA

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:32.017
CRUZ WAS MAKING ABOUT THREE

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:33.285
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND WHEN

00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:34.352
I BROUGHT THIS UP TO THEM.

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:35.854
THEY THEIR GRUMBLING ABOUT IT

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:36.955
BUT THEY JUST STOP CHARGING

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.190
COPAYS THEY REALIZE THAT WAS A

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:39.858
LITTLE BIT SILLY MONTEREY HAS

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:40.959
PUSHED BACK A LITTLE BIT AND

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:43.061
THEIR CONCERN WAS EXACTLY THE

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:45.363
ISSUE ABOUT FRIVOLOUS.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.298
VISITS AND THAT'S WHY I TALKED

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:47.132
THEM AND I COMMITTED TO THEM

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.266
THAT IF YOU ARE SEEING THAT SHOW

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:49.968
ME THE DATA LET'S TALK ABOUT

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.436
OTHER WAYS WE CAN DO AND IF I

00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:52.604
CAN HELP.

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.606
I'M HAPPY TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:56.108
WE'RE PUTTING THINGS IN PLACE OR

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:57.476
ALLOWING THEM TO PUT PROCEDURES

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.244
IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:01.046
THEY'RE ABLE TO TRIAGE DID

00:23:01.113 --> 00:23:01.913
THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.748
THEY'RE GETTING.

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:05.884
INMATES INTO MEDICAL CARE

00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:06.852
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THOSE THE

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.186
MEDICAL BEDS FILLED UP FOR THOSE

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:11.089
DOCTORS BUSY WITH CASES THAT

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:12.491
THEY DON'T NEED TO SEE THAT'S

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:15.293
THAT'S A MEDICAL ISSUE AS WELL.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.561
BUT AGAIN THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS

00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:18.063
ARE TELLING ME BOTH OF THE LOCAL

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.464
LEVEL THE STATE LEVEL THAT'S NOT

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.633
WHAT THEY SEE.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.034
MAKE YOUR SHERMAN NEVER STONE

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:25.570
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER.

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:26.404
CERTAINLY THERE ARE WE HAVE A

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:29.174
MOTION -- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:31.042
AMOUNT OF EXPENSE THAT A COUNTY

00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:33.378
HAS TO GO THROUGH BOTH TO

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:35.180
DETERMINE WHETHER THE PERSON

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:37.616
COURT IN THE COUNTY JAIL HAS THE

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:39.918
MEANS EVEN TO COVER THE COST.

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.019
AND SO FIRST YOU HAVE TO GO

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:43.188
THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS AND

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:47.659
THEN EVEN TRYING TO COLLECT --

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:50.729
THIS SEEMS TO ME -- A A BARRIER

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:53.665
THAT IS DOES NOT HAVE AS THE

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:56.434
AUTHOR PORTRAYED.

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:58.537
EIGHT ILLEGITIMATE LOGIC -- AND

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:00.138
IF WE LOOK AT WHEN WE THINK

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:01.840
ABOUT IN THIS I KNOW THAT THE

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.942
PURPOSE IS NOT TO MINIMIZE COSTS

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:06.978
BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE CONCERNS

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:08.079
MY COLLEAGUE.

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:09.414
REFERENED.

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:11.183
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:13.385
STATUS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:15.053
OUR IF THE FOLKS WHO SERVE IN

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.221
OUR COUNTY JAILS.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:17.923
THERE ARE FROM LOW INCOME

00:24:17.989 --> 00:24:19.424
BACKGROUNDS THEY HAVE THEY DID

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:21.993
NOT COME INTO JAIL AS BY AND

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.462
LARGE AS EITHER MIDDLE CLASS OR

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:25.263
WEALTHY PEOPLE.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.097
SO.

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:27.999
THAT JUST BY CORRELATION THEY

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:29.868
PROBABLY DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:32.204
HEALTHCARE EVEN PRIOR TO GETTING

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.472
INTO COUNTY JAIL SO JUST GIVEN

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:36.241
OUR HEALTH SYSTEM WITHOUT

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:37.375
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE.

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:39.311
SO THEY ALREADY PROBABLY HAD

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:42.047
BUILT UP HEALTH AND MEDICAL

00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:44.716
NEEDS -- IT'S JUST ANOTHER

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:47.919
FEATURE OF ARE UNFORTUNATE --

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.788
SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:52.290
LOWER INCOME HAVE MUCH LESS

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:55.227
ACCESS TO MANY -- SERVICES SO I

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:57.462
THINK YOUR BILL MAKES A LOT OF

00:24:57.529 --> 00:25:00.932
SENSE -- WE HAVE A MOTION YOU

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:04.102

A BILL THAT.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.916
BRINGS TOGETHER THE THE WAY THAT

THE BENEFIT OF THE CREDIT SYSTEM

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.692
IS IT'S A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.027
PEOPLE INSIDE ARE.

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:03.495
TAKING THE COURSE IS DOING THE

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:05.330
KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY NEED.

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.032
IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.433

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:48.018
OUT -- WE KNOW THE G. V. R. O.

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:49.653
HAS BEEN UNDER UTILIZED AND I'M

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.822
SEEING THAT AS I GROW ACROSS THE

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:53.223
STATE AND TALK WITH COURTS.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.192
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT SOME

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:57.561
OF THE CHALLENGES -- WE BELIEVE

00:44:57.628 --> 00:44:59.496
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING IS

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:01.698
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL ARE I WANT

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:03.600
TO NOTE THAT THE G. V. R. O. IS

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:04.935
A CIVIL NOT A CRIMINAL

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:07.204
PROCEEDING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.573
PLAYS A HOWEVER A SIGNIFICANT

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.208
ROLE IN G. B. R. OWES.

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:12.409
AND IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.278
FROM OTHER RESTRAINING ORDER

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:15.112
PROCESS SEES.

00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:16.613
THERE ARE PARTIES IN THESE

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.749
MATTERS THEIR PARTICIPATION

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.384
LEGAL PROCESS WITH THEIR

00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:22.319
DECLARATIONS FILING THE CORRECT

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:26.957
FORMS APPEARING FOR TESTIMONY.

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.192
THAT'S ALL CRITICAL.

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:28.792
AND NONE OF THAT CAN HAPPEN

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:30.294
WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING --

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.762
IN ADDITION TO FILING THE FORMS

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:33.330
TESTIFYING APPEARING AT THE

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:35.132
HEARINGS THEY'RE ALSO EXPECTED

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:37.234

WHICH INCLUDES REQUESTING THAT

THE RESTRAINT PARTY TURN OVER

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.240
THEIR FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:44.775
WHEN THEY BECOME PROHIBITED.

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.510
AND OF COURSE THIS CAN BE A VERY

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.178
DANGEROUS TIME FOR LAW

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:49.847

BILL FARM -- WE'VE HEARD THAT

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:36.524
THIS IS A LOOPHOLE AND OBVIOUSLY

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:39.194
CRIMINALS WHO ARE NOT OBEYING

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:39.828

HOWEVER THIS BILLS GOT A LOT OF

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:47.002
PROBLEMS WITH IT AND HOW THE

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:48.837
PUBLIC'S GOING TO COMPLY WITH IT

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:49.437
AS WELL AS HOW IT'S ACTUALLY

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:50.338
GOING.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:51.840
TO GOING TO AFFECT ITS RELYING

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:54.175
ON THE AMMO BACKGROUND CHECK TO

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:12.627
BE FORCING WITH THAT AND I THINK

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:14.129
THAT THIS IS PREMATURE TO RELY

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:15.363

PICTORIALS AND INFORMATION ON

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:37.352
HOW TO IDENTIFY THESE PARTS --

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:38.553
I'M VERY CURIOUS TO SEE THAT

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.255
WEEDS -- WERE STILL LOOKING FOR

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:41.690

WEAPONS AND SO NOW TO PUT THIS

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:48.897
GIANT TASK OF IDENTIFYING EVERY

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:50.732
HUNK OF METAL WHICH QUALIFIES AS

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:51.966
A PRECURSOR PART.

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:53.134
IS THAT IS GOING TO BE A

01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:55.003
MONUMENTAL TASK AND I'D BE VERY

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:57.505
CURIOUS -- TO DISCUSS THE FISCAL

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:59.040
WHEN THAT BECOMES APPROPRIATE --

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.308
FURTHERS THERE'S OTHER ISSUES

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:01.409
LIKE ANTIQUE PARTS WHAT'S

EXCLUSIVELY FOR ANTIQUE FIREARM

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:03.978
AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:05.046
DISTINGUISH THAT.

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.115
AS WELL AS THE YOU KNOW THE THE

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:07.949
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:09.484
PRECURSOR PARTS DO NOT HAVE ANY

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.852
IDENTIFYING MARKS ON ON THAT

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:12.520
LIKE A FARM WHERE IS A FIREARM

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:14.222
FRAME HAS A SERIAL NUMBER.

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:15.857
WHICH MAKES IT IDENTIFIABLE YOU

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:18.059
CAN SEE IF THE CHECKS RUN WERE

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.028
AS A PIECE OF METAL THAT.

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:21.029
THAT IS AN UNFINISHED FRAME

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:22.097
RECEIVERS NOT GONNA HAVE A PART

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.565
NUMBER ON IT OR MIGHT HAVE A

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:24.366
PART NUMBER BUT IT'S NOT GONNA

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:25.767
HAVE A SERIAL NUMBER YOU'RE NOT

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:26.267
GOING TO KNOW THE DATA

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:27.035
MANUFACTURING.

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:28.069
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW ANY OF

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:28.870
THAT SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.572
KNOW IF SOMEONE BOUGHT IT BEFORE

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:31.873
THIS LAW INTO EFFECT WHETHER

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.241
IT'S BEEN SOMETHING.

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:34.943
THAT WAS PURCHASED AFTERWARDS

01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:36.044
WHETHER THEY CAME IN FROM OUT OF

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:38.513
STATE HOUSES ACTUALLY TRULY

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.415
GOING TO BE ENFORCED -- I THINK

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:42.117
THAT THIS IS -- THIS IS STILL

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:43.685
PREMATURE I I THINK THAT

SINCE BIAS IS LEARNED OVER THE

COURSE OF A LIFETIME IT IS VERY

01:48:02.742 --> 01:48:04.945
DIFFICULT TO UNLEARN IT.

01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:06.580
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WITH

TRAINING.

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:11.818

DECISION OR PROSECUTOR WHO IS

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:18.578
MAKING A CHARGING DECISION IN

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.380
FACT REASONABLY ONE COULD ARGUE

01:50:20.447 --> 01:50:22.115
THAT THROUGHOUT THE CRIMINAL

01:50:22.182 --> 01:50:22.849
JUSTICE SYSTEM?

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.851
SEEN AN INDIVIDUAL AND HAVE ANY

01:50:24.918 --> 01:50:26.586
REACTION IN YOUR BRAIN IS IF

01:50:26.653 --> 01:50:27.821
YOU'VE SEEN A SPIDER OR SNAKE

01:50:27.887 --> 01:50:28.688
WHICH WILL INCREASE YOUR BEGINS

01:50:28.755 --> 01:50:30.523
OF FEAR THREAD EXCITING AND

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:31.858
DISTRUST TOWARDS AN INDIVIDUAL.

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:34.794
COULD REASONABLY AND CONCEIVABLY.

01:50:34.861 --> 01:50:37.230
ALTER YOUR DECISION MAKING WITH

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:38.198
REGARD TO THAT PERSON.

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:40.834
PERHAPS THAT IS IN MOST A STARK

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.836
RELIEF AND AND AND MOST CLEARLY

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:44.237
SEEN THOUGH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:50:44.304 --> 01:50:45.372
THE ACTIONS OF OUR PEACE

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:47.140
OFFICERS.

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:48.608
IF INDEED WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:50.810
NOTION OF SOMEONE HAVING OF YOUR

01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:52.879
THREAD EXILED YOUR DISTRUST

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:53.980
REACTION TO ONE GROUP VERSUS

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:54.781
ANOTHER IN.

01:50:54.848 --> 01:50:56.383
NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL STUDY

01:50:56.449 --> 01:50:58.718
SHOWING THAT WE CN EVEN.

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:00.153
TRACK THAT BASED ON FACIAL

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.354
FEATURES.

01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:02.989
SO THAT A PERSON WHO HAS A BIAS

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:03.523
AGAINST LET'S SEE AFRICAN

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:05.759
AMERICANS WILL BE MORE LIKELY --

01:51:05.825 --> 01:51:06.893
IMPLICIT BIAS WILL BE MORE

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.194
LIKELY TO HAVE THESE SPIDER

01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:09.796
SNAKE LIKE BRAIN REACTIONS TO

01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:12.866
SOMEONE WHO LOOKS FAR MORE LIKE

01:51:12.932 --> 01:51:14.701
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL THAN MATT DAMON.

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:15.869
OTHER THAT NOT WITHSTANDING

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:17.637
THOUGH THIS NOTION IMPLICIT BIAS

01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:19.072
IN THE SPECIFIC NOR REACTIONS

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:22.342
LINK DIRECTLY TO OUR STUDIES ON

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:24.511
BEHAVIOR THAT IS THE LIFE AND

01:51:24.577 --> 01:51:26.713
DEATH DECISION MAKING CONTEXT

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.848
FOR PEACE OFFICERS. FOR INSTANCE

01:51:28.915 --> 01:51:31.017
OF WHEN WE DO COMPUTER AYE

01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:32.652
SIMULATION SIMULATIONS AND THEY

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:33.987
SHOW PEOPLE POPPING UP ON THE

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:34.788
SCREEN.

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:36.890
INDIVIDUALS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:51:36.956 --> 01:51:38.558
AND ANGLO AMERICAN DESCENT WHO

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:40.460
ARE EITHER HOLDING A WALLET A

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:41.194
CELLPHONE OR GUN.

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:43.363
WITH INSTANTANEOUS REACTION TIME

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:45.598
WE FIND THAT THE INDIVIDUALS IN

01:51:45.665 --> 01:51:46.666
THE UNITED STATES.

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:48.835
WHO CHAU IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:50.937
AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THREE

01:51:51.004 --> 01:51:53.773
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SELECT THE

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.975
OPTION SHOOT? FOR AN AFRICAN

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:57.544
AMERICAN MAN HOLDING A WALLET OR

01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:59.612
CELL PHONE THREE TIMES MORE

01:51:59.679 --> 01:52:00.880
LIKELY THAN THEY ARE FOR A

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:04.751
CAUCASIAN MAN HOLDING A GUN.

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:06.086
WE CAN ACTUALLY ON DO THIS.

01:52:06.152 --> 01:52:07.120
THE THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:09.456
NEUROSCIENCE PROVIDES US WITH

01:52:09.522 --> 01:52:11.124
MUCH MORE THAN A HOLD HANDS SING

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:13.693
C° Y OUR OPEN MINDS AND HAVE A

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.462
MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP TYPE

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:17.330
COURSE WE CAN GO FURTHER THAN

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:18.798
THAT AND ALTER THOSE VERY BRING

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:19.466
REACTIONS.

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:20.600
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS

01:52:20.667 --> 01:52:22.535
PROBLEMATIC AND THAT'S WHAT THE

01:52:22.602 --> 01:52:23.870
NEUROSCIENCE SHOWS US WE CAN

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:25.605
LOWER THE LEVEL OF A MID

01:52:25.672 --> 01:52:26.773
DELIVERY ACTION.

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.174
WE CAN ACTUALLY TURN ON THE

01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:30.210
PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT INCREASE

01:52:30.276 --> 01:52:31.144
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:32.846
AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:34.581
WE SEE THAT PEOPLE WILL GET MORE

01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:36.382
ACCURATE IN SAYING SHOOT VERSUS

01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:38.384
NO SHOOT WHEN FACED WITH AN

01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:39.752
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S HOLDING AN

01:52:39.819 --> 01:52:41.521
OBJECT WE CAN LITERALLY INCREASE

01:52:41.588 --> 01:52:43.623
THEIR LEVEL OF ACCURACY.

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:45.892
THAT'S WHAT TRAINING CAN DO.

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:46.960
OF COURSE THEM.

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:49.629
IN CALIFORNIA THE JUDGES RECEIVE --

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:51.431
TRAINING IN ETHICS ON A REGULAR

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:53.700
BASIS A KEY WE I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:55.235
NUMBER WERE ON AT THIS POINT WE

01:52:55.301 --> 01:52:57.670
TEND TO CALL IT -- AND AT THE

01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:59.472
NATIONAL JUDICIAL COLLEGE A

01:52:59.539 --> 01:53:00.840
TRAINING IS UPDATED ON A REGULAR

01:53:00.907 --> 01:53:03.109
BASIS EVERY SINGLE TIME A CLASS

01:53:03.176 --> 01:53:05.211
IS TAUGHT THERE IS AN UPDATE. TO

01:53:05.278 --> 01:53:06.079
THAT PARTICULAR TRAINING SO WHAT

01:53:06.146 --> 01:53:08.515
DAY DOES NOT SO MUCH A CONCERN.

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:10.316
IT'S JUST PART OF WHAT HAS TO BE

01:53:10.383 --> 01:53:12.785
DONE -- PERHAPS THE MORE

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:14.787
IMPORTANTLY WHEN WANTING FUSES

01:53:14.854 --> 01:53:16.022
SCIENCE.

01:53:16.089 --> 01:53:17.891
IN INFORMATION AROUND DECISION

01:53:17.957 --> 01:53:18.491
MAKING.

01:53:18.558 --> 01:53:20.627
IT IS NOT IS IT IS NECESSARY TO

01:53:20.693 --> 01:53:21.961
CONSTANTLY UPDATE.

01:53:22.028 --> 01:53:23.396
ANYONE WHO WAS DOING THEIR JOB

01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:25.765
WELL WE'LL KEEP UP WITH THE DAY

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:27.734
TO DAY INFORMATION THAT IS BEING

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:29.068
PUT OUT BY THESE NARAL

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:30.837
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THE GIVES US

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:34.174
BETTER AND BETTER SOLUTIONS.

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.742
EACH AND EVERY TIME.

01:53:35.808 --> 01:53:36.409
IT TAKES A WHILE TO RIDE A CLASS.

01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:37.377
IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG TO

01:53:37.443 --> 01:53:39.379
UPDATE IT IF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY

01:53:39.445 --> 01:53:41.548
PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SCIENCE.

01:53:41.614 --> 01:53:42.916
ANY CLASS THAT YOU TAKE SHOULD

01:53:42.982 --> 01:53:44.150
BE UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS

01:53:44.217 --> 01:53:45.251
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLASSICAL

01:53:45.318 --> 01:53:46.653
ENGLISH LITERATURE.

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:49.022
I UNDERSTAND THAT -- ONE BUT

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.990
INDEED IF WE USE THE SCIENCE IF

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:52.892
WE USE THE TOOLS IF WE TRY TO

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:54.060
CREATE AN EFFECTIVE TRAINING

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:56.596
THAT WILL ALTER DECISION MAKING

01:53:56.663 --> 01:53:58.164
ALTER BEHAVIOR.

01:53:58.231 --> 01:54:00.033
AND ALTER NORMAL REACTIONS WE

01:54:00.099 --> 01:54:01.534
CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE JUSTICE

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:02.769
OUTCOMES THROUGHOUT THE CRIMINAL

01:54:02.835 --> 01:54:05.605

THE HI I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:30.623
TALK WITH -- THE DISTRICT

01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:31.624
ATTORNEY OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY

01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:33.126
WHO'S AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE AND

01:55:33.192 --> 01:55:34.327
I THINK.

01:55:34.394 --> 01:55:35.928
PRETTY PROGRESSIVE WHO ALSO

01:55:35.995 --> 01:55:36.529

POST.

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:40.199
AND SO I ASKED HER WHAT SHE

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:43.036
THOUGHT OF THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE

01:55:43.102 --> 01:55:44.871
IT INSTEAD OF EVERY FIVE YEARS

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:47.607
EVERY TWO YEARS.

01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:49.375
IN OUR FIRST RESPONSE WAS MIKE.

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:50.410
YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD WE DO UPDATE

01:55:50.476 --> 01:55:53.112
THIS EVERY FIVE YEARS AND THIS

01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:53.980
WOULD MAKE IT SO WERE IN

01:55:54.047 --> 01:55:56.149
CONSTANT UPDATE MODE AND I HEARD

01:55:56.215 --> 01:55:57.450
YOU SAYING YOU KNOW SCIENCE

01:55:57.517 --> 01:55:58.818
KEEPS CHANGING.

01:55:58.885 --> 01:56:00.153
WE LEARN MORE.

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:06.492
ON A REGULAR BASIS SHE SAYS SO.

01:56:06.559 --> 01:56:09.362
IT IS THE FIRST FALL -- THE

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:11.030
IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IS

01:56:11.097 --> 01:56:13.032
ALREADY OFFERED IN THE ACADEMY

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:15.034
SO AT LEAST WE GET STARTED

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:15.902
PEOPLE THINKING YOU KNOW THEY

01:56:15.968 --> 01:56:17.403
MAY HAVE I MEAN EVERYBODY IS A

01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:18.971
LITTLE BIAS.

01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:21.107
IS A GREAT THE BROADWAY SHOW

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:23.509
CALLED -- AVENUE Q. AND A FAVOR

01:56:23.576 --> 01:56:24.744
SO THERE'S A WONDERFUL SONG IN

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:25.611
THERE IT'S IS EVERYBODY'S A

01:56:25.678 --> 01:56:27.580
LITTLE BIT RACIST AND THEY TALK

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:28.414
ABOUT HOW.

01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:30.116
YEAH EVERYBODY DOES HAVE CERTAIN

01:56:30.183 --> 01:56:31.751
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT ARE

01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:34.787
NOT ACCURATE BUT BASED UPON LIFE

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:36.556
EXPERIENCE OR WHATEVER SO.

01:56:36.622 --> 01:56:38.725
I START WITH THAT ASSUMPTION --

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.793
SHE SAYS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.495
THE TRAINING IS ONLINE OR

01:56:42.562 --> 01:56:44.964
AGENCIES PUT TOGETHER OF COURSE.

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:46.466
ON THEIR OWN.

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:48.601
OFFICERS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:50.503
TAKE BY ANDATE FIRST AID AND

01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:52.405
CPR EVERY TWO YEARS DOMESTIC

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:53.673
VIOLENCE EVERY TWO YEARS BLOOD

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:55.908
BORNE PATHOGENS EVERY TWO YEARS.

01:56:55.975 --> 01:56:59.879
AND PURSUE DRIVING EVERY YEAR --

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:02.081
SHE SAYS THAT THE SHE BELIEVES

01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:03.583
THAT THE TRAINING DEMANDS WERE

01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:07.453
NOW PUTTING ON FOLKS -- MAKE IT

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.189
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO AND SHE

01:57:10.256 --> 01:57:11.491

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:18.798
YEARS AND FOCUSED INSTEAD ON DE

01:57:18.865 --> 01:57:20.133
ESCALATION.

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:22.135
AND THE USE OF FORCE AT LEAST

01:57:22.201 --> 01:57:24.203
FOR NOW SHE SAYS CONSIDERING THE

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:25.972

THAT IS PUT ON POST AND ON THE

01:57:29.675 --> 01:57:31.444
OFFICERS GIVEN ALL THESE THINGS

PREEMPT SOME THOSE ARE THE OTHER

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:44.424
ITEMS THAT WERE ARTICULATED OR

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:47.493
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.095
TRAINING THAT WE ACTUALLY.

01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:49.729
EVEN THOUGH WE MUST DO IT THAT

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:51.697
REALISTICALLY WE CAN ALSO

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:56.035
REQUIRE EVERY TWO YEARS.

01:57:56.102 --> 01:57:58.671
THAT TO ME SENATOR WITH THAT --

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:01.274

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.810
YOU YOU CAN RESERVE.

01:58:03.876 --> 01:58:05.311
THANK YOU -- I RESPECT TO THE

NOTION THAT INDEED THERE ARE

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:08.648
SEVERAL COURSES THAT ARE PEACE

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:10.149
OFFICERS MUCH TAKE MUST TAKE.

01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:11.651
THAT ARE -- RE UP EVERY TWO

01:58:11.717 --> 01:58:14.120
YEARS SO TO SPEAK AND THE LIST

01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:17.023
THAT YOU A NUMERATOR -- WAS OF I

01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.990
THINK PARTICULARLY POIGNANT

01:58:18.057 --> 01:58:19.292
BECAUSE THOSE ARE ABOUT PUBLIC

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:21.060
SAFETY IN A VERY REAL AND DIRECT

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:22.762
WAY -- IMMEDIATE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:24.330
IMMEDIATE DECISIONS THAT ARE

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:27.099
MADE AND STRESSFUL CONTEXT THAT --

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:28.734
AFFECT LIFE AND DEATH OF OUR

01:58:28.801 --> 01:58:29.902
CITIZENS RIANA ME ON A REGULAR

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:30.870
BASIS.

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:32.305
I WOULD PLACE DISCOURSE IN THAT

01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:34.774
SAME CATEGORY -- I WOULD SAY

01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:37.477
THAT YES EVERYONE IS A LITTLE

01:58:37.543 --> 01:58:38.644
BIT BIASED.

01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:39.846
MONDAY BIAS MANIFESTS ITSELF IN

01:58:39.912 --> 01:58:41.814
THE CLASSROOM WE HAVE GIVEN OUR

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:45.318
TEACHERS OF THE TOOLS OF A PIECE

01:58:45.384 --> 01:58:45.918
OF CHALK.

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:46.486
WHEN IT?

01:58:46.552 --> 01:58:46.886
WHEN IT?

01:58:46.953 --> 01:58:52.091
MANIFEST ON THE BENCH WE'VE

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:52.692
GIVEN OUR JUDGES A GAVEL IN A

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:53.860
ROW.

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:54.794
BUT WHEN IT MANIFESTS IN THE

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:55.394
ACTIONS OF OUR PEACE OFFICERS

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:56.696
WE'VE GIVEN THEM A GUN.

01:58:56.762 --> 01:58:57.663
WE MUST THEREFORE HOLD THEM TO A

01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:59.232
HIGHER STANDARD.

01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:01.133
WE MUST HOLD THEM. TO THAT

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.802
HIGHER STANDARD AND AT THE SAME

01:59:02.869 --> 01:59:04.337
TIME SUPPORT THEM.

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:06.606
WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION.

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:08.140
THE LUCKY THING IS THAT IN THE

01:59:08.207 --> 01:59:10.142
PAST WE'VE CREATED THESE COURSES

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:12.445
BE AT THE KEY WE COURSES FOR THE

01:59:12.512 --> 01:59:14.547
JUDGES IN THE JUDICIAL CONTEXT.

01:59:14.614 --> 01:59:15.848
FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OR

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:17.783
A POST WE'VE TYPICALLY CREATED

01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:19.118
THEM WITH COMMITTEES WORKING

01:59:19.185 --> 01:59:21.087
TOGETHER GATHERING INFORMATION

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:23.122
AND AND DELIBEATING OVER THE

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:24.991
PROCESS -- IF IF I'M SURE YOU'VE

01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:26.158
BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE OF

01:59:26.225 --> 01:59:28.027
COMMITTEES AND IT GOES BACK AND

01:59:28.094 --> 01:59:29.395
FORTH IN THEIR TO DRAFT AND THEN

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:30.396
THERE'S REDRAFTED THEIR SUB

01:59:30.463 --> 01:59:31.197
COMMITTEES AND IS CANCELED

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:32.832
MEETINGS AND IT DOESTAKE QUITE

01:59:32.899 --> 01:59:33.866
SOME TIME.

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:35.301
THE NOTION IS THOUGH WITH

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:37.370
ACADEMICIANS AND EXPERTS ARE

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:39.005
INCLUDED IN THAT PROCESS.

01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:40.773
IF IF EXPERTISE IS BROUGHT TO

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.241
BEAR AND THERE'S A REGULAR

01:59:42.308 --> 01:59:43.609
UPDATING JUST THE WAY IT'S DONE

01:59:43.676 --> 01:59:45.077
AT HE NATIONAL JUDICIAL COLLEGE

01:59:45.144 --> 01:59:46.412
JUSTIN WAITED STUNT ANOTHER

01:59:46.479 --> 01:59:47.980
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WILL

01:59:48.047 --> 01:59:49.949
GET HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCT.

01:59:50.016 --> 01:59:51.250
AND THE LATEST INFORMATION

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:53.185
RARELY WILL YOU HAVE A SITUATION

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:54.353
WHERE THE NEW SCIENCE WILL COME

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:56.355
UP YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING

01:59:56.422 --> 01:59:57.723
OUT THAT IS INCORRECT.

01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:59.292
RATHER WHAT YOU WILL FIND WITH

01:59:59.358 --> 02:00:01.093
GREATER FREQUENCY NINETY PLUS

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:03.362
PERCENT USUAL FIND AN EVEN

02:00:03.429 --> 02:00:04.964
BETTER SOLUTION.

02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:06.899
EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU CONTINUE

02:00:06.966 --> 02:00:08.734
TO PURSUE THE SCIENCE I THINK

02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:10.937
OUR OUR PUBLIC DESERVES THAT.

02:00:11.003 --> 02:00:11.771
I THINK OUR PEACE OFFICERS TO

02:00:11.837 --> 02:00:13.105
DESERVE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:15.041
ALSO ABOUT THEIR SAFETY THOSE

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:16.475
SAME STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:17.209
PEOPLE ARE THAT ARE PEACE

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:18.477
OFFICERS ARE MORE LIKELY.

02:00:18.544 --> 02:00:21.981
AND MORE QUICK TO SAY SHOOT FOR

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:23.516
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN HOLDING

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:24.817
A WALLET OR CELL PHONE.

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:26.052
ALSO SAY THERE ARE PEACE

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:28.421
OFFICERS DELAYED.

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:29.956
WHEN THEY ARE DECIDING WHETHER

02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:31.524
OR NOT TO SHOOT AN ANGLO

02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:32.792
AMERICAN MAN WITH A GUN THAT

02:00:32.858 --> 02:00:34.427
PUTS OUR PEACE OFFICERS AT RISK

02:00:34.493 --> 02:00:35.328
AS WELL?

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:37.096
SO FOR THEIR SAKE I THINK WHAT

02:00:37.163 --> 02:00:39.131
WE SHOULD DO IS INCREASE THE

02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:41.767
LEVEL OF QUALITY INCREASE THE

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:43.336
UPDATE INCREASE THE COMMITMENT.

02:00:43.402 --> 02:00:44.370
I THINK WE'LL GET A BETTER

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:46.238
OUTCOME IN THE END.

02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:54.013
MATT MAJORS FOLLOWERS THAT MAY.

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.781
SO YOU THE EXAMPLES YOU CITE ARE

02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:56.549
EXAMPLES THAT COME UNDER THE

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:57.283
HEADING OF DE ESCALATION IN THE

02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:58.184
USE OF FORCE.

02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:59.885
AND I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT IS A

02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:01.921
FOCAL POINT -- AND THE NECESSARY --

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:04.657
ONE AS WE ADDRESS POLICE OFFICER

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:07.259
TRAINING IT'S FEDERAL CHARTER SO

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:08.294
I AM.

02:01:08.361 --> 02:01:09.562
I GUESS MY QUESTION IS.

02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:10.863
IS THIS AN EITHER OR SITUATION

02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:14.200
OR COULD WE INCORPORATE BIAS.

02:01:14.266 --> 02:01:16.435
FOCUSING ON THE DE ESCALATION

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:18.170
AND USE OF FORCE ELEMENT RATHER

02:01:18.237 --> 02:01:23.476
THAN -- BE TRYING TO CHEST.

02:01:23.542 --> 02:01:25.378
CRANE ON THIS PARTICULAR GENERAL

02:01:25.444 --> 02:01:27.179
I SUBJECT MATTER EVERY TWO YEARS

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:28.881
BECAUSE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:30.950
CONCERNS IS THAT THERE MAY NOT

02:01:31.017 --> 02:01:34.020
BE ENOUGH -- RESOURCES OR

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:35.154
WHATEVER YOU FOR THAT WOULD.

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:36.822
THAT MIGHT END UP TEACHING THE

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:38.891
SAME COURSE YOU MENTIONED IF WE

02:01:38.958 --> 02:01:40.159
CAN UPDATE THEM THAT'S GREAT BUT

02:01:40.226 --> 02:01:41.694
MIGHT END UP OFFERING THE SAME

02:01:41.761 --> 02:01:43.629
COURSE YOU'RE AFTER WHICH WE

02:01:43.696 --> 02:01:45.398
DON'T WANT.

02:01:45.464 --> 02:01:46.799
SO I'M NOT WORRIED BEFORE YOU

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:48.634
RESPOND AS IF WE COULD --

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:51.537
BRIEFLY ON THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

02:01:51.604 --> 02:01:54.273
ABSOLUTELY.

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:54.540
THANK YOU.

02:01:54.607 --> 02:01:58.511
MADAM CHAIR -- IF THIS TRAINING

02:01:58.577 --> 02:02:00.279
WERE TO SIMPLY BECOME AN AD

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:02.615
JUMPED ONTO THE ESCALATION IT

02:02:02.682 --> 02:02:03.983
WOULD LIKELY LOSE ITS EFFICACY.

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:06.552
OF THE NOTION OF TEACHING.

02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:08.754
DE ESCALATION -- AND THEN ADDING

02:02:08.821 --> 02:02:10.923
ON THE NOTION OF IMPLICIT BIAS

02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:12.324
WOULD NOT COMPLETELY SOLVE THE

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:14.460
PROBLEM THE SCINCE WILL SHOW

02:02:14.527 --> 02:02:16.328
THAT WHILE YOU CAN TEACH PEOPLE

02:02:16.395 --> 02:02:18.130
TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR IN GENERAL

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:19.565
AND THEN MENTION -- YES AND

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:21.000
LET'S TRY TO BE FAIR THAT

02:02:21.067 --> 02:02:23.436
DOESN'T ALTER THE INEQUITY IN

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:25.337
THE ACTUAL BEHAVIOR SO THE

02:02:25.404 --> 02:02:27.239
PROBLEM IS NOT SIMPLY WE NEED

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:28.507
OUR PEACE OFFICERS TO DE

02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:30.176
ESCALATE ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:02:30.242 --> 02:02:31.677
THE PROBLEM IN MANY WAYS AS WE

02:02:31.744 --> 02:02:33.112
NEED THEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY

02:02:33.179 --> 02:02:34.780
HAVE MORE TROUBLE DE ESCALATING

02:02:34.847 --> 02:02:36.816
IN THIS ARENA AND THEN GIVE THEM

02:02:36.882 --> 02:02:38.250
THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED WHICH

02:02:38.317 --> 02:02:40.419
REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST.

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:41.921
AND FUSE IT IN HERE WITH A FEW

02:02:41.987 --> 02:02:43.089
ADDITIONAL POWER POINTS.

02:02:43.155 --> 02:02:44.457
GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT THEY

02:02:44.523 --> 02:02:45.357
NEED TO ACTUALLY ALTER THEIR

02:02:45.424 --> 02:02:47.860
BEHAVIOR WITH REGARD TO THAT

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.361
PARTICULAR TYPE OF BIAS.

02:02:49.428 --> 02:02:51.664
THANK YOU FOR SHIP.

02:02:51.731 --> 02:02:59.171
pI APPRECIATE THE BILL I DO M..

02:02:59.238 --> 02:03:01.340
I CAN'T IMAGINE AS WAS A

02:03:01.407 --> 02:03:03.609
REFERENCE SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:05.478
EVERY TWO YEARS BECAUSE WHILE I

02:03:05.544 --> 02:03:08.147
THINK ALL OF US CAN --

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:10.182
UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:03:10.249 --> 02:03:11.517
THIS.

02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:13.152
THE VALUE OF THIS TRAINING WE

02:03:13.219 --> 02:03:15.454
ALSO KNOW THAT -- WHATEVER

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:17.790
GOVERNMENT AGE EVERYTHING IS IT

02:03:17.857 --> 02:03:20.359
THAT THE THAT THAT FREQUENCY BUT

02:03:20.426 --> 02:03:28.200
pSOMETIMES BUT I THINK THAT AS

02:03:28.267 --> 02:03:30.002
YOUR WITNESS CHARACTERIZED.

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:31.837
BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A LIFE OR

02:03:31.904 --> 02:03:33.105
DEATH SITUATION AND A LIFE OR

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:34.540
DEATH SITUATION AS MUCH FOR A

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:35.941
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

02:03:36.008 --> 02:03:38.577
BECAUSE AS I WAS VERY IMPRESSED

02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:41.247
WITH THE REFERENCES WHICH I

02:03:41.313 --> 02:03:43.415
THINK -- WE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

02:03:43.482 --> 02:03:45.084
DATA KNOW TO BE TRUE.

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:49.088
THAT THE THAT THESE BIASES WHICH

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:51.190
UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR CULTURE WE

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:55.127
ALL HAVE THEY'RE NOT UNIQUE AND

02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:58.097
THEY'RE NOT LIKE ONLY ONE RACE

02:03:58.164 --> 02:03:59.899
HAS THE HAS THE BIAS -- IT'S

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:03.536
BASICALLY SO INGRAINED THAT WE

02:04:03.602 --> 02:04:05.171
THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

02:04:05.237 --> 02:04:06.505
THEMSELVES PUT THEMSELVES AT

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:08.274
RISK.

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:10.242
WHEN THEY HESITATE?

02:04:10.309 --> 02:04:11.443
IF IT WERE IF THEY SEE A WEAPON

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:13.512
IN ONE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT OVER

02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:15.181
COMPENSATE EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T

02:04:15.247 --> 02:04:16.549
SEE A WEAPON IN A DIFFERENT

02:04:16.615 --> 02:04:19.185
CIRCUMSTANCE SO I I THINK THAT

02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:22.288
THIS IS VERY COMPELLING -- AND

02:04:22.354 --> 02:04:23.923

YOU'RE REALLY ONLY OF PROBES AND

02:04:27.059 --> 02:04:29.028
THEN -- FLOOR BUT IF THERE ARE

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:30.796
REAL CONCERNS AROUND THE TWO

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:35.201
YEARS THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED --

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:36.168
OTHERWISE I THINK THERE'S A

02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:37.803
VALUE TO THE FREQUENCY SO --

02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:38.404

APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND THE

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:23.883
CONVERSATION IN THE DIALOGUE --

02:05:23.949 --> 02:05:26.418
THIS BILL REALLY JUST CREATES A

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:27.920
STANDARD AND SO WHEN HEARING IN

02:05:27.987 --> 02:05:28.888
THE LANGUAGE THERE IS SOME

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:30.589
FLEXIBILITY NOT AROUND THE TWO

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:32.024
YEARS BUT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:33.592
IN HOW THE CURRICULUM CAN BE

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:35.194
REFRESHED AND ADAPTED.

02:05:35.261 --> 02:05:36.195
AND ALSO HOW THEIR SOME

02:05:36.262 --> 02:05:37.763
OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR MORE

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:41.233
INTEGRATED -- KIND OF COURSE AT

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:43.002
THE I AND I THINK WHEN WE'RE

02:05:43.068 --> 02:05:43.535
TALKING ABOUT BIAS WERE

02:05:43.602 --> 02:05:45.170
GENERALLY THINKING ABOUT LAW

02:05:45.237 --> 02:05:46.438
ENFORCEMENT AND THE PUBLIC.

02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:47.539
IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:48.440
THINK ABOUT THE BIAS THAT

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:50.709
HAPPENS WHICH WITH IN THE LAW

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:52.478
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITIES WE KNOW

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:54.680
THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE IS NO

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:56.782
THERE ARE VARYING DEGREES OF

02:05:56.849 --> 02:05:58.717
EDUCATIONAL LEVELS -- THAT WE

02:05:58.784 --> 02:05:59.785
SEE IN OUR POLICE OFFICERS

02:05:59.852 --> 02:06:01.220
BEFORE THEY DECIDE TO GO TO THE

02:06:01.287 --> 02:06:02.554
ACADEMY TO GET TRAINING AND WHEN

02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:03.889
THEY'RE GOING INTO THE ACADEMY

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:04.890
TO GET TRAINING MOST OF THAT IS

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:06.859
PREPARING ON THEM TO ACTUALLY DO

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:08.227
THAT JOB.

02:06:08.294 --> 02:06:10.229
NOT NECESSARILY TALKING ABOUT

02:06:10.296 --> 02:06:10.996
BIAS.

02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:12.298
AND I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:13.499
IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT THE

02:06:13.565 --> 02:06:15.267
DIVERSITY OF THE STATE AND THE

02:06:15.334 --> 02:06:18.504
DIVERSITY OF THEMEMBERS THAT

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:20.205
ARE ARE SERVING AND PROTECTING

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:21.106
US.

02:06:21.173 --> 02:06:23.309
I THINK ALSO THAT DE ESCALATION

02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:24.276
IS ACTUALLY COUPLED WITH

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:26.178
IMPLICIT BIAS I DON'T THINK YOU

02:06:26.245 --> 02:06:28.347
CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND

02:06:28.414 --> 02:06:29.281
DE ESCALATION USE OF DEADLY

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:31.016
FORCE WITHOUT REALLY HAVING A

02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:32.384
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TRIGGERS

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:35.087
THAT MIGHT BE IMPACTING HOW LAW --

02:06:35.154 --> 02:06:36.689
HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ACTUALLY

02:06:36.755 --> 02:06:37.556
YOU KNOW?

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:38.991
REACTING IN INTERACTING WITH

02:06:39.058 --> 02:06:40.693
FOLKS IN THOSE MOMENTS AND SO MY

02:06:40.759 --> 02:06:42.194
HOPE IS THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:43.128
INTEGRATED.

02:06:43.195 --> 02:06:44.229

02:06:47.466 --> 02:06:49.301
WE'RE SEEING -- ON THE STREETS

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:50.402
AS IT RELATES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:52.338

THIS VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM.

02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:56.300
NOW THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED

02:27:56.367 --> 02:27:57.835
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE WANT TO

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:04.008
BILL AB SIX IN A THREE AT CHIEF

02:28:04.075 --> 02:28:05.409
THREE IMPORTANT GOALS.

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:07.278
THE FIRST IS THAT IT PLACES THE

02:28:07.345 --> 02:28:08.713
CALVET PROGRAM IT TO STATUTE

02:28:08.779 --> 02:28:09.880
MAKING THIS A MORE PERMANENT

02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:11.916
FIXTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S VIOLENCE

02:28:11.983 --> 02:28:13.317
PREVENTION INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:28:13.384 --> 02:28:15.253
SEC YET THE BILL WOULD REMOVE

02:28:15.319 --> 02:28:17.121
OUTDATED AWARD CAPS THAT ARE

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:19.123
HOLD OVER FROM PRIOR YEARS WHEN

02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:20.791
THE PROGRAM WAS MUCH SMALLER.

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:23.394
I PRESIDENT AWARD CABS ARE AT

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:23.995
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:28:24.061 --> 02:28:30.735
PER GRAND T. OVER TWO YEAR

02:28:30.801 --> 02:28:32.837
PERIOD WHICH WOULD FOR FIRST BSE

02:28:32.903 --> 02:28:34.138
SEE WHICH IS THE AGENCY THAT

02:28:34.205 --> 02:28:35.506
ADMINISTERS CALVET -- TO DILUTE

02:28:35.573 --> 02:28:36.073
THIS PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY BY

02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:36.674
DISTRIBUTING A LARGE NUMBER OF

02:28:36.741 --> 02:28:37.942
SMALLER GRANTS ACROSS THE STATE.

02:28:38.009 --> 02:28:39.043
AND THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE

02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:40.311
COUNTY I. P. EXECUTIVE STEERING

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:41.846
COMMITTEE TO SET A MORE

02:28:41.912 --> 02:28:43.114
REASONABLE CAP SO THAT

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:44.682
APPLICANTS IF THEY CHOOSE CAN

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:46.217
APPLY FOR MORE FUNDING DEPENDING

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:48.986
ON LOCAL NEED AND CONDITIONS.

02:28:49.053 --> 02:28:50.488
THIRD THIS BILL FOCUSES ON

02:28:50.554 --> 02:28:52.189
CALVET THIS BILL FOCUSES CALVET

02:28:52.256 --> 02:28:53.924
TO RESOURCES I'M COMMUNITIES AND

02:28:53.991 --> 02:28:55.159
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AT THE

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:56.861
HIGHEST RISK OF EXPOSURE TO

02:28:56.927 --> 02:28:57.695
VIOLENCE.

02:28:57.762 --> 02:28:59.430
WE KNOW BASED ON DATA AND

02:28:59.497 --> 02:29:00.665
STUDIES THAT VIOLENCE IS

02:29:00.731 --> 02:29:02.600
EXTREMELY CLUSTERED IN A SMALL

02:29:02.667 --> 02:29:04.702
NUMBER OF PLACES AND IMPORTANTLY

02:29:04.769 --> 02:29:06.637
IN ANY GIVEN CITY THE VAST

02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:07.805
MAJORITY OF SERIOUS VIOLENCE IS

02:29:07.872 --> 02:29:09.173
CARRIED OUT BY A VERY SMALL

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:10.675
PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS.

02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:11.909
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:13.811
APPLICANTS TO PROPOSE PLANS AND

02:29:13.878 --> 02:29:15.046
STRATEGIES TO WORK WITH THOSE

02:29:15.112 --> 02:29:16.881
ROUTE HIGHEST RISK OF ENGAGING

02:29:16.947 --> 02:29:18.082
IN VIOLENCE.

02:29:18.149 --> 02:29:19.216
THEY'RE JUST TWENTY FOUR

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:20.885
CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT COMBINED

02:29:20.951 --> 02:29:22.520
CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF THE

02:29:22.586 --> 02:29:24.588
HOMICIDES THAT ARE EXPERIENCED

02:29:24.655 --> 02:29:26.157
IN THE STATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

02:29:26.223 --> 02:29:27.692
AND IT IS IN THESE COMMUNITIES

02:29:27.758 --> 02:29:29.327
THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING THE

02:29:29.393 --> 02:29:30.995
BULK OF OUR RESOURCES.

02:29:31.062 --> 02:29:31.962
OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

02:29:32.029 --> 02:29:33.464
SUCCESSFUL STATE WIDE VIOLENCE

02:29:33.531 --> 02:29:34.665
INTERVENTION PROGRAMS SUCH AS

CONNECTICUT NEW YORK AND

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:40.304
MASSACHUSETTS ARE FOLLOWING THIS

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:41.672
EXACT SAME STRUCTURE.

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:42.340
THIS BILL WOULD BRING OUR CAL B.

02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:44.041
I. P. PROGRAM IN LINE WITH BEST

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:45.443
PRACTICES FROM OTHER STATES.

02:29:45.509 --> 02:29:46.344
WHICH HAVE RATES OF GUN

02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:49.080
HOMICIDES MUCH MUCH LOWER THAN

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:50.481
CALIFORNIA.

02:29:50.548 --> 02:29:51.782
SO VIOLENCE IS IMPOSING AN

02:29:51.849 --> 02:29:53.617
INCREDIBLE COST IN TERMS OF

02:29:53.684 --> 02:29:55.286

02:29:55.353 --> 02:29:57.288
COST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HEALTH

02:29:57.355 --> 02:29:58.689
CARE COST IT CETERA.

02:29:58.756 --> 02:30:00.157
AND INVESTING IN SCALING UP

02:30:00.224 --> 02:30:01.659
PROVEN SOLUTIONS IN OUR MOST

02:30:01.726 --> 02:30:03.728
IMPACTED CITIES IS A VERY SMART

02:30:03.794 --> 02:30:04.562

WHAT ARE MY BUT I JUST MISSION I

THINK ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL

02:32:17.661 --> 02:32:18.896
THINGS THIS WOULD LIFT THE CAPS

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:19.864
WHICH IS IMPORTANT.

02:32:19.930 --> 02:32:20.664

MORE RESOURCES -- WE CAN DO THAT

02:39:21.184 --> 02:39:22.519
SUSPECT THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO

02:39:22.586 --> 02:39:24.655
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT

02:39:24.721 --> 02:39:25.589
WITHOUT.

02:39:25.656 --> 02:39:27.090
TOTALLY CLOSING THE DOOR FOR

02:39:27.157 --> 02:39:29.393
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS

02:39:29.459 --> 02:39:29.860

ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION SO AGAIN

02:39:33.063 --> 02:39:35.465
WHO IS NOT A DESIRE ON THE PART

02:39:35.532 --> 02:39:36.566
OF SHERIFF'S TO SHARE --

02:39:36.633 --> 02:39:37.734
INFORMATION FOR IMMIGRATION

02:39:37.801 --> 02:39:41.438
PURPOSES -- BUT UNDERSTANDING

02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:43.006
THAT THERE ARE.

02:39:43.073 --> 02:39:43.607
NEEDS AND REASONS WHY FEDERAL

02:39:43.674 --> 02:39:44.408
LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD NEED TO

02:39:44.474 --> 02:39:45.409
ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT

02:39:45.475 --> 02:39:47.010
DANGEROUS PEOPLE IRRESPECTIVE OF

IMMIGRATION STATUS -- AND SO --

02:39:51.381 --> 02:39:52.449
FOR THOSE REASONS WE

02:39:52.516 --> 02:39:54.051
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOVA THANK

02:39:54.117 --> 02:39:54.217
YOU.

02:39:54.284 --> 02:39:55.319
OKAY.

02:39:55.385 --> 02:39:57.788
HEART ANY OTHER.

02:39:57.854 --> 02:40:00.190
OPPOSITION EARN ANY COMMENTS OR

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:04.928
QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS.

02:40:04.995 --> 02:40:08.498
ALL RIGHT AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:40:08.565 --> 02:40:10.767
WOULD YOU LIKE TO A CLOSER AND I

02:40:10.834 --> 02:40:11.468
HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE DON'T

02:40:11.535 --> 02:40:12.569
SHARE SATIN BE HAPPY TO WORK

02:40:12.636 --> 02:40:13.637
WITH THEM THIS IS BEEN

02:40:13.704 --> 02:40:15.105
FRUSTRATING FOR US I THINK

02:40:15.172 --> 02:40:18.175
TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE BILL --

02:40:18.241 --> 02:40:19.910
TO TO REALLY NARROWLY FOCUS IT

02:40:19.977 --> 02:40:22.546
ON WHAT WE KNOW HAS HAPPENED

02:40:22.612 --> 02:40:24.414
WITHOUT EXPLANATION FROM ICE WE

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:27.217
KNOW -- THAT ICE HAS SHOWN UP ON

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:29.353
THE DOORSTEP OF OF INDIVIDUALS

02:40:29.419 --> 02:40:30.921
WHO OTHERWISE LAW ABIDING

02:40:30.988 --> 02:40:33.090
INDIVIDUALS WHO -- ARE HERE WITH

02:40:33.156 --> 02:40:35.058
THEIR AB SIXTY LICENSE

02:40:35.125 --> 02:40:36.793
INFORMATION AND PICTURE.

02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:39.463
THAT WE KNOW -- WHEN WE PASS

02:40:39.529 --> 02:40:41.999
THIS BILL WE TOLD PEOPLE IF YOU

02:40:42.065 --> 02:40:43.867
HAVEN'T COMMITTED A CRIME YOU'RE

02:40:43.934 --> 02:40:45.102
NOT THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE USED

02:40:45.168 --> 02:40:46.303
AGAINST YOU?

02:40:46.370 --> 02:40:48.005
SO THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION

02:40:48.071 --> 02:40:50.240
IN THE COMMUNITY WE WANT PEOPLE

02:40:50.307 --> 02:40:52.309
TO BE DRIVING AWFULLY IT'S GOOD

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:53.677
FOR ALL OF US RIGHT.

02:40:53.744 --> 02:40:55.178
ARE ONLY IN AND WE'VE HAD

02:40:55.245 --> 02:40:56.646
MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS

02:40:56.713 --> 02:40:58.815
WE COULD GO OUT AND TELL OUR

02:40:58.882 --> 02:40:59.716
COMMUNITIES DON'T GO GET THIS

02:40:59.783 --> 02:41:01.585
LICENSE I MEAN THAT'S NOT WE

02:41:01.651 --> 02:41:03.453
WILL BE GOING BACKWARDS IN

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:05.055
SAFETY I THINK -- AND I THINK

02:41:05.122 --> 02:41:05.922
ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS WILL

02:41:05.989 --> 02:41:10.127
BE GOING BACKWARDS ON THE SAFETY

02:41:10.193 --> 02:41:12.162
ISSUE -- ICE OF COURSE ONE TELL

02:41:12.229 --> 02:41:14.097
US EXACTLY HOW THEY GOT THIS

02:41:14.164 --> 02:41:16.967
INFORMATION -- DMV HAS TOLD US

02:41:17.034 --> 02:41:18.602
THAT IT IS NOT DIRECTLY FROM DMV

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:19.970
BUT THEY HAVE TOLD US WHERE THIS

02:41:20.037 --> 02:41:21.705
INFORMATION GOES AND SO WE'RE

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:23.607
TRYING TO CREATE A BILL -- THAT

02:41:23.673 --> 02:41:25.842
PREVENTS ICE FROM FROM GETTING

02:41:25.909 --> 02:41:28.712
THAT DMV PHOTO AND INFORMATION --

02:41:28.779 --> 02:41:30.781
FROM A DATABASE OF AT BECAUSE

02:41:30.847 --> 02:41:32.549
THEY HAVE A NAME AND THEY CAN

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:34.918
SEARCH THAT DATABASE SO WHAT.

02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:36.553
I UNDERSTAND AND I AM AT MY

02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:38.055
FRUSTRATION I HOPE I DON'T SOUND

02:41:38.121 --> 02:41:38.989
TOO FRUSTRATED I.

02:41:39.056 --> 02:41:40.757
WE HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE SAYING

02:41:40.824 --> 02:41:42.125
THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW THAT THAT

02:41:42.192 --> 02:41:43.493
THAT'S TO BROADER DOESN'T WORK

02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:44.628
THAT WAY WILL SOMEBODY TELL ME

02:41:44.694 --> 02:41:46.096
HOW IT WORKS.

02:41:46.163 --> 02:41:48.765
IN WE WILL.

02:41:48.832 --> 02:41:49.966
NARROWLY TAILOR.

02:41:50.033 --> 02:41:50.767
THIS BILL TO AVOID THAT RIGHT

02:41:50.834 --> 02:41:52.469
NOW WE THINK IF YOU HAVE AN

02:41:52.536 --> 02:41:53.537
ACTUAL WARRANT FOR SOMEBODY SO

02:41:53.603 --> 02:41:54.704
IF THEY'VE COMMITTED A CRIME%

02:41:54.771 --> 02:41:56.540
OKAY YOU CAN SEARCH THE DATABASE

02:41:56.606 --> 02:41:58.175
AND YOU UTILIZE.

02:41:58.241 --> 02:41:59.176
THE DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT'S IN

02:41:59.242 --> 02:42:01.378
THERE TO FIND THE PERSON THIS IS

02:42:01.445 --> 02:42:02.546
IF YOU HAVE.

02:42:02.612 --> 02:42:04.815
SIMPLY A DEPORTATION ORDER --

02:42:04.881 --> 02:42:06.883
THAT YOU CAN'T GO IN AT AS ICE

02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:08.985
AND SEARCH THE DATABASE TO COME

02:42:09.052 --> 02:42:09.920
UP WITH THEIR CURRENT ADDRESS

02:42:09.986 --> 02:42:11.254
AND PICTURE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:42:11.321 --> 02:42:12.722
TRYING TO AVOID.

02:42:12.789 --> 02:42:16.193
FOR OTHERWISE LAW ABIDING IN --

02:42:16.259 --> 02:42:18.161
RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA -- SO

02:42:18.228 --> 02:42:19.463
WITH THAT IT YOU KNOW I'LL

02:42:19.529 --> 02:42:22.299
CONTINUE TO DEFINITELY WORK WITH

02:42:22.365 --> 02:42:22.899
THE SHERIFF'S AND ANYONE ELSE

02:42:22.966 --> 02:42:23.233
THAT.

02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:24.501
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE

02:42:24.568 --> 02:42:26.169
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- BECAUSE

02:42:26.236 --> 02:42:27.604
NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE AN ANSWER

02:42:27.671 --> 02:42:29.940
JUST -- PROTEST IN OUR ONLY

02:42:30.006 --> 02:42:31.708
OTHER ANSWER I WILL I WILL SAY

02:42:31.775 --> 02:42:33.210
AGAIN IS TO GO TO OUR COMMUNITY

02:42:33.276 --> 02:42:34.578
AND SAY YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF

02:42:34.644 --> 02:42:35.779
AT RISK BY GETTING AB SIXTY

02:42:35.846 --> 02:42:36.346
LICENSE.

02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:39.349
THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR ANY OF US

02:42:39.416 --> 02:42:40.283
