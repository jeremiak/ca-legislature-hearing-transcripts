00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:59.189
WILDFIRES HAVE KILLED MORE

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:01.057
CALIFORNIANS THAN EARTHQUAKES

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:03.193
AND FLOODS COMBINED AND THE

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.095
RISK CONTINUES TO MULTIPLY YEAR

00:51:05.162 --> 00:51:07.964
AFTER YEAR. SB TWELVE IS PART

00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:09.599
OF THE BLUEPRINT FOR FIRE SAFE

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:11.034
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:13.503
WHICH WOULD ENSURE CITIES AND

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.505
COUNTIES CREEK FIRE SAFETY

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:16.773
STANDARDS PRIOR TO PERMITTING

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.909
DEVELOPMENT IN VERY HIGH RISK

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:20.744
AREAS IT'S A BALANCING

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:22.546
REASONABLE LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:24.047
TO THE WILDFIRE EMERGENCY THAT

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:26.116
IS ENGULFING IN ENDANGERING OUR

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:28.251
COMMUNITIES. UNLIKE WHAT SOME

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:29.519
MEMBERS HAVE SAID OR LIKE THE

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.822
LA TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD THIS

00:51:31.888 --> 00:51:34.524
IS NOT AN OUTRIGHT MORATORIUM.

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:36.726
SB TWELVE CENTS A MINIMUM FOR

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:39.429
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE HIGHEST

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.331
FIRE RISK AREAS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:44.067
ONLY IN THE HIGHEST VERY- HIGH

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:46.937
FIRE HAZARD ZONES SO THERE'VE

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:48.104
BEEN SOME CONFUSION THAT THIS

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:50.140
WOULD TAKE IN MORE BUT IT'S AN

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:51.041
ONLY THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:53.109
ZONE. CURRENT STATE STANDARDS

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:54.444
ARE LIMITED TO THE BUILDING

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:55.912
CODE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ROAD

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:58.515
SIGNS IN FUEL BRICKS SB TWELVE

00:51:58.582 --> 00:51:59.449
SETS UP A TRANSFORMATIONAL

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:00.517
PROCESS FOR THE STATE FARM

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.552
MARSHALL TO ESTABLISH BOLD NEW

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:03.687
STANDARDS THAT ENSURE

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:04.955
DEVELOPMENTS AS A WHOLE ARE

00:52:05.021 --> 00:52:07.257
DESIGNED. TO WITHSTAND FIRE NOT

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:08.558
JUST THE BUILDINGS WITHIN THOSE

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.026
DEVELOPMENTS SO WHAT KIND OF

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:11.228
STANDARDS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:12.896
SO NUMBER ONE A WILDFIRE

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.531
ASSESSMENT AND WHILE FOR HAZARD

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:15.999
MITIGATION PLAN WOULD BE

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.300
ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE STATE

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:19.603
FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE. LOCATION

00:52:19.669 --> 00:52:20.203
AND CONSTRUCTION OF

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.072
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:24.574
REDUCE IGNITION POTENTIAL AND

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.009
AT THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:27.611
AVAILABILITY OF WATER SUPPLIES

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.546
ESSENTIAL FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:31.681
DURING A WILDFIRE. THERE WOULD

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:33.416
NOT OF THEIR NO LONGER BE

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:34.451
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:36.353
DEVELOPMENT ONE WAY IN AND ONE

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:37.721
WAY OUT YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:40.090
INGRESS AND EGRESS DEFENSIBLE

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.925
SPACE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND

00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.693
FUEL MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.694
AND IN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:46.329
ESTABLISHED FUNDED AND

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:48.198
IMPLEMENTED TO VERIFY ONGOING

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:52.302
COMPLIANCE IT WOULD BE BACK BY

00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:53.270
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION FEES. BUT

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:55.505
WE PUT. THIS LEGISLATION WILL

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:58.241
HELP SAVE LIVES. HOWEVER THE

00:52:58.308 --> 00:52:59.709
BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT

00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:01.811
STANDARDS BE REASONABLE. AND TO

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:03.747
BE FEASIBLE. AND ACHIEVABLE FOR

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.982
THE MAJORITY DEVELOPMENTS. THIS

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.484
MEANS DESPITE WHAT SOME HAVE

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:09.686
SAID S. B. TWELVE WILL NOT

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:11.388
CREATE A BLANKET BAN ON NEW

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:12.956
DEVELOPMENT. I THINK IT'S

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:14.791
REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:15.992
THERE IS A PARALLEL EFFORT

00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:17.561
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT THE

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:18.895
BOARD OF FORESTRY. THEY

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:21.331
CANDIDLY TAKES EIGHT MUCH MORE

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:23.333
ROBUST APPROACH WHEN IT COMES

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.035
TO BUILDING IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:27.437
AREAS. SB TWELVE DOES NOT DO

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:30.040
THAT. THESE STANDARDS WITHIN

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.641
THIS BILL ARE TIERED TO THE

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:32.709
STANDARDS GET INCREASINGLY

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.244
STRONGER AS DEVELOPMENTS GET

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:36.880
LARGER IN VERY HIGH FIRE RISK

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.682
AREAS. IT'S STRUCTURED THIS WAY

00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:40.283
BECAUSE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS PUT

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.452
MORE FOLKS INTO THOSE ZONES

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:43.219
THIS MEANS THAT THE

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:45.121
REQUIREMENTS ARE STRINGENT BUT-

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:47.557
ARE NOT TOO COSTLY TO PREVENT

00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:50.160
DEVELOPMENT. NOW THANKS TO THE

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:51.995
CHAIR IN TWO PREVIOUS CHAIRS

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.930
WE'VE AMENDED THIS BILL AT

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.599
SINCE THE LAST COMMITTEE TO

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:57.200
CLARIFY THAT THE WILDFIRE RISK

00:53:57.267 --> 00:53:59.202
REDUCTION STANDARDS ONLY APPLY

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:00.604
TO RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:02.205
NOT TO RETAIL NOT COMMERCIAL

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:04.140
EXCEPT. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE

00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:05.609
HEARD THAT SECTION SEVENTEEN OF

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:07.143
THIS BILL COULD IMPACT THE

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:07.911
BORDER FORCE REACH REGULATORY

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:09.946

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:11.147
INTENTION TO ADDRESS THIS

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:12.449
CONCERN WE'VE AMENDED THE BILL

00:54:12.515 --> 00:54:14.150
TO REMOVE THE LINE FROM THE

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:16.086
PERIMETER. WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.520
WITH AT THE COMMITTEES

FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS WHICH I'D

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.360
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER.

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:24.794
CLARIFY THAT THE FINDINGS LOCAL

00:54:24.861 --> 00:54:26.763
GOVERNMENTS WAS MAKE TO APPROVE

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.798
MINUTES PROJECT ARE NOT SEPTIC

SINGLE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:35.805
AND WE CLARIFY TECHNICAL-

00:54:35.872 --> 00:54:37.140
CHANGES RELATED TO FIRE

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:40.944
SUBDIVISION MAPS. AND THE BOARD

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:41.544

ISTHE THIRD YEAR OF THIS BILL.

00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:45.348
THIRD YEAR OF THIS BILL IN THIS

WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED WE'VE

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:51.721
HAD DOZENS OF CALIFORNIANS

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:54.691
STUFF. TWENTY SIX BILLION

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.793
DOLLARS IN RESIDENTIAL AND

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.095
COMMERCIAL LOSSES IN THE SAME

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:01.297
ZONES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:04.267
ADVANCING STANDARDS FOR. TOO

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:04.868
MANY TIMES IN THE PAST SO JUST

BE HONEST. TOO MANY TIMES IN

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.438
THE PAST POLITICS HAVE GOTTEN

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:10.707
THE WAY OF DATA. THE DATA SHOWS

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:11.908
THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.010
WE BUILD IN THE WAY WE REBUILD

00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:16.046
IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE DON'T

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:17.647
CANDIDLY WE NO MORE DEATH AND

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.716
DESTRUCTION WILL FOLLOW. I LOOK

PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL

WON'T BELABOR THE POINT AT

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:07.197
MISTER CHAIR JUST APPRECIATE

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.765
YOU TAKING A MOMENT ALL I WOULD

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:10.867
SAY MEMBERS IS THAT I'M THE ONE

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:12.569
WITH THE MARCH MORE AGGRESSIVE

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:13.870
VERSION OF THIS LEGISLATION

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:17.340
THAT WAS HELD IN THE SENATE- SB

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:19.809
FIFTY FIVE- WE PUT FORWARD IS

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:21.144
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE AN

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:22.579
ACTUAL BAR ON CERTAIN

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:24.748
DEVELOPMENTS- IF CERTAIN

00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:27.050
CONDITIONS WERE MET. AND I'M

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.853
I'M- I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THIS

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:31.821
MEASURE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:33.823
THAT EVEN AS IT'S BEEN AMENDED

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.426
TODAY- PASSING WHAT IS

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:38.294
ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT OF SB

00:56:38.361 --> 00:56:38.962
ONE EIGHTY TWO THAT PASSED WITH

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:41.364
NEAR UNANIMOUS SUPPORT- COUPLE

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:42.932
YEARS AGO. I JUST HOPE THIS

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:44.901
LEGISLATURE REALIZES THAT WE

00:56:44.968 --> 00:56:45.935
CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BACKWARDS I

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:47.470
THINK THIS IS PRESERVING WHAT.

00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:49.105
THE GOVERNOR I WAS SITTING ON

00:56:49.172 --> 00:56:50.073
THE GOVERNOR'S DESK A COUPLE

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.375
YEARS AGO- AND PUTS A MINIMUM

00:56:52.442 --> 00:56:55.345
STANDARDS IN PLACE. BUT THE

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:56.446
FACT IS IT'S INEQUITABLE. TO

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:59.849
ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:02.218
VERY HIGH END PROPERTIES IN

00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:03.987
VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:05.355
IN MY VIEW AND HAVE THAT BE

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:07.290
SUBSIDIZED BY EVERYBODY ELSE

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:09.292
THE CROSS SUBSIDY OF ALLOWING

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:11.060
THE NEXT MILLION CALIFORNIANS

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:12.362
TO MOVE INTO VERY HIGH FIRE

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.063
SEVERITY ZONES ON EVERYBODY

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:17.133
ELSE IS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.135
UNDER REASON STANFORD ANALYSIS

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:20.937
AND THAT KIND OF SORT OF CROSS

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:23.406
TRANSFER IS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:24.974
DON'T ALWAYS APPRECIATE BUT IF

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.109
THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:27.944
ENSURE THOSE DEVELOPMENTS ARE

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:30.880
AS- DURABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AS

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:31.848
POSSIBLE AND WE'RE SEEING IT

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:33.783
HAPPEN. OUT IN NEW HALL RANCH

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.385
THEY'RE DOING THAT WORK THEY

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:36.820
CLEARED THEIR SEQUEL PROCESS

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:38.521
AND ARE BUILDING A DEVELOPMENT

WITH PROPER HARDENING STANDARDS

00:57:39.722 --> 00:57:41.224
IN PLACE THAT'S THE KIND OF

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.393
DEVELOPMENT THAT CAN MAKE IT

00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:45.395

THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.451

NEARLY 25% OF OUR POPULATION IS

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:29.011
A HUGE HUGE ISSUE FOR CAL FIRE

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.447

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.235

COMMITTEE- BUT I DO THINK THE

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.038
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BACK

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.840

YOU BUT SENATOR A STERN- THIS

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.111

THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND YOU'VE

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.557
TAKEN SOME OF THE ADMIT IT MEN

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:38.560
MINUTES I DO HAVE A FEW

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:42.497
QUESTIONS- BUT OF COURSE IN MY

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:47.269
SCOPE SCUFFLE HERE THEY ARE-

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:49.070
ONE IS THE CONCERN THAT WAS

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:51.906
MENTIONED RELATED TO SEQUEL-

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:55.477
AND RELATED TO- IF A PROJECT IS

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:57.445
DOWN THE ROAD AND THEN ALL OF A

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:59.314
SUDDEN THERE CAN BE SOME KIND

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:02.450
OF MOCK MINOR MODIFICATION WITH

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:04.519
THIS IN FACT REQUIRES A WHOLE

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:06.087
NOTHER ROUND A SEQUEL CAN YOU

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:07.722

SO WE DO NEED TO HAVE CNTINUE

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.361
CONVERSATIONS ON THAT ISSUE THE

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.030
EXAMPLE OF A CURB CUT BEING

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:16.765
CHANGE IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.433
TO GET AFTER RIGHT I THINK THAT

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.268
EVEN IF THERE IS A TENTATIVE

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:21.736
MATTER MAP APPROVED THAT A

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:25.340
pFOR OVER A DECADE WE'RE NOT

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:27.676
LOOKING AT TRYING TO MESS UP

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:28.843
THAT TENTATIVE MAP THAT HAD

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:30.645
BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY A

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:32.681
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT I DO THINK

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.382
IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT IF THERE

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:35.550
IS A DEVELOPMENT THAT IS

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.919
CURRENTLY. IN DISCUSSION AT A

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:38.953
COUNCIL PLANNING COMMISSION

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.955
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LEVEL-

01:22:41.022 --> 01:22:42.557
THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THIS

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.459
PROCESS I'M MORE THAN WILLING

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:46.194
MORE THAN WILLING MADAM

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:46.828
ASSEMBLY WOMAN NOW SAY THIS ON

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.129
THE RECORD TODAY TO BE ABLE TO

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.964
FIND A SWEET SPOT FOR A

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:52.901
COMPROMISE- BUT IT THE EXAMPLE

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.135
OF A MINOR CHANGE IN THE

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:56.805
SIDEWALK OR A CURB CUT IS NOT

01:22:56.871 --> 01:22:57.706
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE

01:22:57.772 --> 01:23:00.709
LOOKING AT TRIGGERING A WHOLE

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.610
NEW REFERRAL FOR ADDITIONAL

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.546

SPRINKLERS IN THOSE AREAS

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:50.411
FRANKLIN HOMES WHICH ADDS QUITE

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:52.346
A BIT TO COST TO A HOUSE.

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:53.781
THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THE

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:55.950
DEFENSIBLE SPACE ARE ONLY TO BE

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:59.153
HAMPERED BY SOME OF THE

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.856
REQUIREMENTS AND LAWS IN THE-

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:04.759
MITIGATION FOR HABITAT AND

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:10.264
CONSERVATION AREAS- GIVEN THAT

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:11.532
THERE ARE THOSE EXTERNAL

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:14.068
PRESSURES YEAH. HOW DO WE HOW

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:18.306
DO YOU GET A- RESIDENTIAL TRACT

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:21.876
OF. PASSED THE HEAD OF THE

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:24.946
LAWSUIT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:27.415
WOULD BRING IN ANY IN ANY AREA

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:30.585
LIKE WHERE I AM FROM. THAT

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:32.386
WOULD BE THE WAY TO A KILLER A

01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:33.688
RESIDENTIAL THING AND YOU SAID

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:35.590
IT YOURSELF YOU'VE GOT ONE TWO

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:36.524
THREE DIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:39.727
LARGE RESIDENTIAL. PROJECTS

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.697
BEING HELD UP IN COURT. BY

01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:44.966
LAWSUITS AND I DOUBT THAT THOSE

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:45.499
LAWSUIT TO RUN BY THE FIRE

01:31:45.566 --> 01:31:47.335
DEPARTMENT. I PROBABLY BOUGHT

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:48.536
MY PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT THOSE

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:50.805
RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THOSE TYPE

01:31:50.872 --> 01:31:53.708
OF AREAS THAT THEY LEFT. AND I

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:55.643
WOULD SAY THAT EVERY PLACE IN

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:59.247
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS A IS

01:31:59.313 --> 01:32:01.215
PRONE TO FIRE AND THAT'S A

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:04.385
CALIFORNIA IS- WE'VE LEARNED A

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:07.588
LOT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:09.390
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED IS THAT WE

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.626
DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH HOUSING

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:12.226
FOR PEOPLE THEY WIND UP IN THE

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:15.463
STREET. AND IF WE'RE NOT GOING

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:19.634
TO ALLOW THE OUTER BANDS TO BE-

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.471
DEVELOPED. AND WHILE THESE ARE

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:26.073
BEING ADDRESSED ALREADY. THEN

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.008
THAT JUST PUSHES THE

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.376
DEVELOPMENT BACK INTO AREAS

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:31.946
THAT ARE ALREADY DEVELOPED. AND

01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:33.748
IN THOSE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:35.449
DON'T WANT DEVELOPMENT WILL BE

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:39.487
PRESERVED FOREVER- BY- BY OUR

01:32:39.553 --> 01:32:43.658
CAMPS- TO SOLVE ISSUES LIKE

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:47.128
THIS- EVERY AREA EVERY REGION

01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:49.063
HAS THEIR OWN DIFFERENT FIRE

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:51.666
PROBLEM. AND IN THOSE FIRE

01:32:51.732 --> 01:32:53.000
AGENCIES THAT TAKE CARE OF

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.435
THOSE AREAS A COUNTIES THE

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.537
CITIES AND THE FIRE AGENCIES

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.105
ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO

01:32:58.172 --> 01:32:59.707
ADDRESS THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:01.475
AND THEIR SPECIFIC AREAS

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:03.077
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS A MUCH

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.946
DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT PROBLEM

01:33:05.012 --> 01:33:06.347
THAN THEY HAVE UP IN NORTHERN

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.883
CALIFORNIA. OR THE BAY AREA OR

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:10.818
THE COASTAL REGIONS BECAUSE

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:11.752
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PERCENT

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:13.120
THEY ARE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:14.088
HUMIDITY RATES THEY HAVE

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:15.923
DIFFERENT BURNING RATES THEY

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:18.059
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES CHAPARRAL-

01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:21.462
AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO NEED

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.331
TO PUT TOGETHER THE PLAN. D.

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:24.065
FOR THEIR AREA AND THEY'RE

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:26.100
ALREADY DOING IT. SO I'M NOT

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:29.303
SEEING WHAT THIS IS NEEDED FOR.

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:33.174
IN TERMS OF INVENTING THAT- A

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.709
LOT OF THE BURNS THAT YOU'VE

01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:36.477
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT AND- THAT

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:38.913
WE HAVE BEEN. TALKING ABOUT ALL

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.983
OF US- THOSE CONFIGURATIONS OF

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.451
HAPPEN IN COMMUNITIES OF MEN

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:45.619
BILL LONG AGO. AND THEY DIDN'T

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:47.888
HAVE THE STANDARDS AND THEY

01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:49.557
DIDN'T HAVE THE TWO WAYS OUT-

01:33:49.623 --> 01:33:51.559
EVERY DEVELOPMENT I KNOW HAS

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:53.094
ALL THOSE STANDARDS AND THEN

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.662
SOME THEY HAVE BOXED EAVES.

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.764
THEY ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE THEY

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:58.532
HAVE ALL THE HOME HARDENING-

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:00.034
ELEMENTS OF A NEED BUT IF YOU

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:02.203
HAVE ONE. BIG STANDARD FOR ALL

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:03.437
OF IT THAT MEANS SOME AREAS

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:05.306
THAT DON'T NEED SOME OF THOSE

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.174
TYPE OF HOME HARDENING EFFORTS.

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:09.510
WILL BE LEFT OUT. THERE THEY'RE

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:11.746
GOING TO BE MADE TO. TO TRY TO

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.614
TRY TO ADHERE TO THOSE WHEN

01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:15.216
THEY DON'T NEED IT WHICH MAKES

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:17.585
THAT HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE

01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:18.219
WHICH PRICES MORE PEOPLE OUT OF

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:20.755
IT. SO YOU KNOW I JUST SEE THIS

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:24.058
THIS. REAL PROBLEM WITH

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:29.497
CONFLICTING- CONFLICTING GOALS.

01:34:29.563 --> 01:34:32.867
AND AND THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:36.537
THIS BILL IS A IS HI I SEE FROM

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:38.806
MY END AND BEING THIRTY FIVE

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:40.908
YEARS IN THAT FIRE SERVICE THE

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.243
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THEY

01:34:42.309 --> 01:34:43.611
DEVELOP NOW VERSUS WHAT THEY

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:46.247
USED TO DEVELOP. AND IN THERE

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:48.616
ARE SOME PLACES THAT THEY DON'T

01:34:48.682 --> 01:34:50.551
WANT DEVELOPMENT UNLESS IT'S

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:53.020
JUST THEIR HOUSE AND I'M

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:55.489
TALKING ABOUT AREAS LIKE MALIBU-

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:57.558
THEY HAD TWO YEARS AGO THE FIRE

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:58.125
THAT WENT FROM THOUSAND OAKS

01:34:58.192 --> 01:34:59.760
ALL THE WAY TO THE BEACH. AND I

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:00.661
KNEW IT WAS GOING TO GO TO THE

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:01.996
BEACH AS SOON AS IT CAUGHT FIRE

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:03.130
MALAM BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

01:35:03.197 --> 01:35:05.199
WIND WAS BLOWING IT WAS STRONG

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:07.401
ENOUGH. THE NEW WITHOUT BRUSHES

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:09.303
LIKE. THERE'S NO STOPPING IT.

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.072
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL THOSE

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:12.373
FOLKS YOU CAN BUILD THEIR

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.775
HOUSES ON THEIR LAND ANYMORE.

01:35:53.047 --> 01:35:55.816
IS ONLY FOCUS ON VERY HIGH FIRE

HAZARD ZONES IT'S NOT FOCUS

01:35:57.852 --> 01:35:59.453
ANYWHERE ELSE. WHETHER YOU ARE

IT WOULDN'T ENCOMPASS-

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:13.400
EVERYONE- BUT IN THOSE SAME

01:36:13.467 --> 01:36:15.769
ZONES. YOU DO NEED STANDARD

01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:17.538
PROTECTION AND NOT EVERY COUNTY

CANDIDLY HAS A MITIGATION PLAN

01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:21.675
IN PLACE FOR INSURERS THAT

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:22.643
THAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.345
DEVELOPMENT SO THAT THAT IS NOT

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:26.847
A UNIVERSAL PRACTICE IN ALL

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:27.681
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. NUMBER

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:31.285
TWO- THERE'S A REASON WHY I'M A

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:34.255
CO AUTHOR- IN CHAMPION OF OUR

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:35.990
AB NINE HUNDRED EXTENSION THAT

01:36:36.056 --> 01:36:37.424
THE ASSEMBLY IN A BIPARTISAN

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:38.859
VOTE SENATE PASSED THIS YEAR

01:36:38.926 --> 01:36:42.530
WHICH IS. A CENTER ATKINS BILL

01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:43.464
IT REDUCES. HOUSING

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:47.568
DEVELOPMENT- SEQUEL LAWSUITS

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:48.269
TWO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:36:48.335 --> 01:36:50.137
DAYS. HE GUARANTEES INSURANCE

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:51.872
ANY DAY JUDICIAL REVIEW THERE'S

01:36:51.939 --> 01:36:54.141
A REASON WHY I'M SUPPORTING SB

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:56.043
SEVEN- IN A BEEN A CHAMPION FOR

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.979
THAT AND THAT IS- TRANSFORMING

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:01.282
DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; DYING MALLS. OFFICE&lt;/c&gt;

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:04.418
PARKS- IN STRIP MALLS. TO DO AT

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:06.854
LEAST 50% HOUSING MINISTERIAL

01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:09.190
THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT SB NINE TO

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:12.059
BE ABLE TO BUILD QUICKLY-

01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:14.528
DUPLEXES IN FOUR PLEXUS. BUT I

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:16.430
GOT TO SAY THE NEW REALITY THAT

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:17.698
WERE IN AND THE REASON WHY THE

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.033
FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:20.968
SUPPORTS THIS. IS BECAUSE THE

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:22.570
STATUS QUO CAN'T CONTINUE TO

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:24.705
MOVE FORWARD WE TALK ABOUT COST

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:27.141
OF THIS BILL WE IGNORE THE COST

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:28.175
OF A TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:30.411
PAY OUT. OF INSURANCE OVER THE

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:32.379
LAST TWO YEARS TWENTY SIX

01:37:32.446 --> 01:37:34.448
BILLION. BY THE WAY FOR THE

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:36.283
VAST MAJORITY THAT INSURERS ARE

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:38.686
NOT GOING TO RECOUP THAT- IN

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:40.387
THE TUBBS FIRE ALONE IN MY NECK

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:41.355
OF THE WOODS ONLY TALK ABOUT

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.390
COST. WHOSE TWELVE BILLION

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:45.025
DOLLARS IN INSURANCE PAYOUTS

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:48.562
TWELVE BILLION IN THE CAMPFIRE

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:49.663
IT WAS NINE BILLION. SO I

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:51.332
APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT TO TALK

01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:53.067
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COSTS ON

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:53.934
THE FRONT END BUT LET'S JUST BE

01:37:54.001 --> 01:37:56.070
HONEST. THE MORE WORK WE HAVE

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.204
IN THE FRONT IN THE CHEAPER

01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:58.872
IT'S GOING TO BE LONGER TERM

01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:01.075
FOR HOMEOWNERS IN CELLS. WE

01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:04.011
CAN'T IGNORE THAT FACT ON THE

01:38:04.078 --> 01:38:05.679
LAWSUIT THE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:08.882
LAWSUITS ARE IN- TIE IN SAN

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:10.217
DIEGO AND THEN IN MY NECK OF

01:38:10.284 --> 01:38:12.152
THE WOODS. AND LAKE COUNTY IS

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:14.121
BECAUSE PER THE ATTORNEY

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:17.424
GENERAL. THEY DID NOT COMPLETE

01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:18.759
PROPER FIRE MITIGATION VIA

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:21.095
SEQUEL THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:23.197
SO WE HAVE THIS BILL THAT WOULD

01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:24.365
CITY STATE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH

01:38:24.431 --> 01:38:26.233
A STATEWIDE STANDARD RIGHT NOW

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.202
IT'S BEING DONE AN AD HOC BASIS

01:38:28.269 --> 01:38:29.770
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD HUNDREDS

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:32.039
IF NOT THOUSANDS OF UNITS IN A

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:35.075
VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES WHY

01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:35.676
WOULDN'T WE WANT TO HAVE THESE

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:40.314
MEDICATIONS. I GOTTA BE HONEST

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:42.716
ABOUT IT AND EVEN WITHOUT THIS

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:44.051
BILL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:45.886
OFFICE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.588
GO AFTER. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:50.157
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT UPHOLDING

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:51.759
THEIR END ON SEQUEL WHEN IT

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.227
COMES TO WHILE FAR MITIGATION

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:55.296
THERE'S A REASON WHY. I

01:38:55.362 --> 01:38:56.930
INDUSTRY SPENDING FIFTY

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.732
THOUSAND DOLLARS FIFTY THOUSAND

01:38:58.799 --> 01:39:00.834
DOLLARS RIGHT NOW ON A MEDIA

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:03.671
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THIS BILL.

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:06.940
IT'S UNHEARD OF. THIS BILL

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:09.176
PASSED THIS LEGISLATURE LAST

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:11.278
YEAR WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT A

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:13.480
STRONGER VERSION OF THIS BILL

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:15.516
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT JUST BEING

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.151
HONEST ABOUT IT I'M NOT AN

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:18.118

WE HAVE. CONFORM THIS BILL TO

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.028
THE SAME BILL THAT EVERYONE

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:31.732
VOTED ON THE TWO THOUSAND

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.033
FIFTEEN OPR STANDARDS LAST YEAR.

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.435
THE MAIN OPPOSITION OF THIS

01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:38.105
BILL WERE NEUTRAL LAST YEAR. ON

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:39.673

THAT IS. WE DO BELIEVE THAT

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.646

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:57.558
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:39:57.624 --> 01:39:59.693
GET EVENTUALLY IF WE'RE LUCKY

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.327

DRIVING FROM THE AIRPORT TODAY

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:34.194
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:36.497
THAT WELL- FOREVER BLIND.

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:37.998
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SURF

01:40:38.065 --> 01:40:39.833
DURING THIS DECADE. IS THE FACT

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.001
THAT. ALMOST ALL OF US HAVE

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:41.835
HAVE WILDFIRES TEAR THROUGH A

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:42.936
COMMITTEE. OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:40:43.003 --> 01:40:44.104
CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE CASE FOR

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:45.606
ME- JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:46.740
BEING ELECTED WITH THE WHEN THE

WEALTHY FIRE. TORE THROUGH MANY

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:49.309
OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:50.744
VICE CHAIRMAN TRENT- AND I WAS

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.646
A SEARING EXPERIENCE FOR ME-

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.948
AND FOR MY COMMUNITY AND I. I

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:55.582
SUSPECT THAT THE REASON YOU'VE

01:40:55.649 --> 01:40:57.351
GOTTEN SUCH. STRICT BIPARTISAN

01:40:57.418 --> 01:40:58.285
SUPPORT TO PASS IS BECAUSE

01:40:58.352 --> 01:40:59.420
EVERYONE IN THIS LEGISLATURE

01:40:59.486 --> 01:41:01.755
APPRECIATES THAT WILDFIRE IS A-

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:03.590
AN EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING.

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:06.827
AND TIMELY AND URGENT PUBLIC

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:07.428
POLICY CRISIS IN THE STATE OF

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:07.928
CALIFORNIA. THE REASON I

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:08.862
SUSPECT YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:09.863
CONCERNED TODAY AND REASON I

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:10.831
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:12.299
DETAILS OF THIS BILL ALL RIGHT

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:13.667
VERY MUCH COMMEND YOU FOR WHERE

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.636
YOU'RE GOING. IS BECAUSE- THIS

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:17.271
BILL IS AT THE INTERSECTION OF

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:18.772
TWO TWO OF OUR BIGGEST PUBLIC

01:41:18.839 --> 01:41:19.473
POLICY CHALLENGES ON ONE HAND

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.175
WILDFIRES. AND ON THE OTHER

01:41:21.241 --> 01:41:22.443
HAND ARE HOUSING AND HOMELESS

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:23.577
CRISIS AND IT'S WHICH HAVE ONLY

01:41:23.644 --> 01:41:26.079
GROWN. MORE URGENT IN IN IN

01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:28.482
RECENT YEARS. AND SO I THINK

01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:29.383
WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM FROM

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:30.284
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.052
WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THAT.

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:33.387
IS CONCERNED ABOUT STRIKING THE

01:41:33.454 --> 01:41:34.721
RIGHT BALANCE AND THREADING

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:35.956
THAT NEEDLE AS OUR AS OUR

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:37.224
COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY PUT IT.

01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:39.660
QUITE ELOQUENTLY- YOU KNOW I

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:40.527
HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THIS.

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:41.995
NIGHT PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM

01:41:42.062 --> 01:41:43.297
BUILDING BUT THE QUESTION FOR

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:45.232
ME IS THIS GOING TO MAKE

01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:47.000
HOUSING. MORE EXPENSIVE.

01:41:47.067 --> 01:41:48.836
UNNECESSARILY I THINK THAT'S

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:49.970
THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE FIFTY

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:51.939
ON- YOU KNOW SO I WAS VERY

01:41:52.005 --> 01:41:52.806
ENCOURAGED TO HEAR WHAT YOU

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.608

DID WANT TO BRING UP WITH YOU

01:42:02.883 --> 01:42:03.884

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:04.785
CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT IT IS

01:42:04.852 --> 01:42:05.986
THAT. THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:07.988
FROM KIND OF LOS ANGELES- I

01:42:08.055 --> 01:42:09.289
KNOW THAT THAT WAS WAS LATE

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:11.058
OPPOSITION AND THINK I CAN'T

01:42:11.124 --> 01:42:11.959
DEFEND THEM ON THE PROCESS

01:42:12.025 --> 01:42:13.894
THERE- BUT BUT I DON'T THINK

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:15.028
THE FACT THAT THEIR- THEIR

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:16.096
ARGUMENTS WERE REYES LATE MEANS

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:17.464
THAT WE SHOULD. WE THREATEN OUR

WHILE THIS BILL IS GENERALLY IN

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:22.669
LINE WITH THE DIRECTION THAT

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:23.604
LOS ANGELES IS COUNTY ITSELF IS

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:25.639
MOVING. IT GOES WELL ABOVE AND

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:26.773
BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.709
CREATING UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY

01:42:28.775 --> 01:42:31.044
HURDLES AND REALLY. PLAN PACKED

01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:33.280

IN DEVELOPMENT ITSELF. I'M JUST

01:42:35.148 --> 01:42:36.650

RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION ABOUT-

01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:53.166
YOU KNOW. WHETHER THE

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:54.501
REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS THAT

01:42:54.568 --> 01:42:55.936

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:57.938

IMPORTANT. TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:12.105
ON HERE TODAY. THE OTHER IECES

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:14.341
THAT- MISS CLARK SILVA I ASKED

01:45:14.408 --> 01:45:16.443
MISS WEEKES ALSO ASK. IS ON THE

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:19.413
ISSUE ND I THINK IT'S- WE NEED

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:21.948
ON THIS AND I DON'T WANNA BES

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.750
WHATSOEVER. WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:25.686
OUT ON THE ISSUE OF SEQUEL-

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:28.655
AND- WHERE THAT SWEET SPOT IS.

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:30.090
I TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT IF

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:33.160
WE CAN LAND THIS. WITH INDUSTRY

01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:35.896
REPRESENTATIVES. ON WHERE'D-

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:37.898
THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS. AND

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:40.000
HOW HOUSING- SORT SO THE

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:41.868
EXAMPLE I GAVE IS. IF YOU

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:43.770
ALREADY HAVE YOUR TENTATIVE MAP

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:44.905
FOR EXAMPLE. A TENTATIVE MAP

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:48.475
CAN BE- CAN STAY. IN PLACE FOR.

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:50.110
OVER TEN YEARS. WE'RE NOT

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:52.379

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:54.081
YOU HAVE. A DEVELOPMENT THAT IS

01:45:54.147 --> 01:45:55.916
CURRENTLY IN PROCESS OR-

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:57.350
WHETHER IT'S A PLANNING LEVEL

01:45:57.417 --> 01:46:00.520
OR- IN FRONT OF A LOCAL

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:01.221
GOVERNING BODY. I FIRMLY

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:03.090
BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD BE A

01:46:03.156 --> 01:46:04.691
FOCUS IN ON THAT ECAUSE IT

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:07.094
DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL- THERE

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.595
IS AN EXAMPLE I'M NOT USING

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:09.396
THIS THAT KICKED THE DOG

01:46:09.463 --> 01:46:11.598
WHATSOEVER BUT- IF WOULD OCCUR

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:13.600
CUT FOR EXAMPLE- KICK IN.

01:46:13.667 --> 01:46:15.202
ADDITIONAL RAGS OR A

01:46:15.268 --> 01:46:16.503
RECIRCULATION OF THE DEVICE

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:18.572
THAT I DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT OUR

01:46:18.638 --> 01:46:20.307
INTENTION WHATSOEVER AND I'D BE

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:23.610
HAPPY TO CLARIFY THAT- THE LAST

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:26.613
THING I'LL SAY IS I THINK. JUST

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:27.881
BEING HONEST ABOUT IT AND I

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:28.849
ALWAYS WANNA BE TRANSPARENT I

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:30.150
THINK THAT THE PIECE WHERE WE

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:31.651
NEED TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:34.421

PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT- AND TO

01:47:51.565 --> 01:47:52.933
TRY TO HIT THAT SWEET SPOT. I

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:54.000
THINK WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO GET

01:47:54.067 --> 01:47:55.302

01:47:58.905 --> 01:48:00.874
VERY. IMPORTANT BALANCE BETWEEN

PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:03.577
THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:04.177
THAN PROTECTING MY COMMITTEE

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:05.912
FROM WIDE FIRE. BUT I ALSO HEAR

01:48:05.979 --> 01:48:07.013
EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR FOLKS IN

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:07.948
MY COMMUNITY A HOUSING AND

01:48:08.014 --> 01:48:09.049
HOMELESSNESS AND SODA IN

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:10.517
ADVERSELY. EXACERBATE THAT

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:12.085
PROBLEM. IS SOME I WANT TO

AVOID IT IF YOU CAN FIND THAT

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:13.920
SWEET SPOT I THINK WE'D ALL BE

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.555

CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS

01:48:19.192 --> 01:48:21.194

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:32.672
ULTIMATE BACKSTOP IS THIS. IF

WE CAN'T GET THIS FIGURED OUT-

01:48:34.641 --> 01:48:35.642
IT IS NOT GOING TO PASS THE

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:36.776
ASSEMBLY FLOOR JUST BEING VERY

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:40.513
HONEST ABOUT IT- IN SO IT IS. A

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.015
MISSION THAT I NEED TO BEYOND

WHERE THAT COMPROMISE IS. AGAIN

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:47.254
I THINK WHERE I WANT TO FIND A

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.122
COMPROMISE. IS NOT. JUST BEING

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:51.424
BLUNT. WE CAN'T NEUTER THIS

01:48:51.491 --> 01:48:52.459
BILL. BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE

01:48:52.525 --> 01:48:55.028
TOO HIGH. AND WANT TO BE ABLE

01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:56.596
TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY. TO TRY

01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:58.531
TO BE ABLE TO. MEET THEM.

01:48:58.598 --> 01:49:00.400
HALFWAY AND I WOULD HOPE THAT

01:49:00.467 --> 01:49:02.969
THERE WOULD BE- RECIPROCAL.

01:49:03.036 --> 01:49:07.841

OUR COLLEAGUES FOR A TRULY

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:36.603
ROBUST CONVERSATION IN RECENT

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:37.904
DAYS I THINK IT HAS BEEN SAID

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:39.372
SEVERAL TIMES READY THESE ARE

01:49:39.439 --> 01:49:41.708
VERY HARD ISSUES ON THE ONE

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:44.110
HAND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:46.446
INCREDIBLE IMMEDIATE CRISIS OF

01:49:46.513 --> 01:49:48.381
WILDFIRES ON THE OTHER HAND WE

01:49:48.448 --> 01:49:50.717
HAVE THE LONGER TERM ONGOING

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:51.651
CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:49:51.718 --> 01:49:53.753
HOUSING- I WILL SAY FOR ONE I

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.388
THINK THE AYE AYE AYE A VERY

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.891
MUCH- BELIEVE- THE AUTHOR IS

01:49:57.958 --> 01:49:59.592
DOING HIS. DARN HARDEST TO

01:49:59.659 --> 01:50:01.461
STRIKE A BALANCE HERE- AND

01:50:01.528 --> 01:50:03.830
CERTAINLY- AS WAS ALLUDED TO-

01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:06.700
THIS IS NOT THE BILL THAT WE

01:50:06.766 --> 01:50:08.168
WERE THAT MANY OF US VOTED ON

01:50:08.234 --> 01:50:09.869
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- THIS IS

01:50:09.936 --> 01:50:12.105
A MORE MODEST BILL COMPARED SB

01:50:12.172 --> 01:50:12.672
ONE EIGHTY TWO THIS IS THE

01:50:12.739 --> 01:50:14.507
THIRD YEAR THE DISCUSSION OF I

01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:15.375
WANTED TO OUR COLLEAGUES

01:50:15.442 --> 01:50:16.476
BECAUSE I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:17.277
FROM A NUMBER OF YOU IN RECENT

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:20.647
DAYS- APPRECIATE ALL OF THE

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:23.450
FOCUS ON THIS- CERTAINLY THE

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:25.151
DISCUSSIONS WE HAD FRANKLY OVER

01:50:25.218 --> 01:50:27.087
THE WEEKEND TO- BRING THE

01:50:27.153 --> 01:50:28.922
AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE. GOING

01:50:28.989 --> 01:50:30.323
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ROUTE

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:31.925
HOW WE MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:35.295
SEQUEL OF SEQUEL ON MINISTERIAL

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:37.197
PERMITS- HOW WE ENSURE THAT

01:50:37.263 --> 01:50:38.865
WE'RE NOT IMPACTING-

01:50:38.932 --> 01:50:39.833
IMPROVEMENTS BEYOND THE

01:50:39.899 --> 01:50:41.568
PROPERTY LINE HOW WE ARE

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:42.936
LIMITING THIS TO RESIDENTIAL

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:44.604
NOT COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL THIS

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:45.805
CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THE

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:46.806
DISCUSSIONS WE HAD IN THIS

01:50:46.873 --> 01:50:48.441
COMMITTEE- BUT I WOULD SAY THE

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:49.009
AUTHOR I THINK YOU'VE HEARD

01:50:49.075 --> 01:50:50.143
LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THAT THERE

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:52.912
IS STILL- IF THIS BILL MOVES

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:55.148
FORWARD- I SUSPECT FOR A NUMBER

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:56.850
OF OUR COLLEAGUES. THESE ARE

01:50:56.916 --> 01:50:58.051
CERTAINLY COURTESY VOTES WITH

01:50:58.118 --> 01:51:00.153
THE HOPE THAT THESE ILL GET

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.654
RESOLVED I WILL SAY ON THE TWO

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:03.890
MAJOR ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:06.793
DISCUSSED I VIEW THEM BOTH- AS

01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:09.596
REQUIRING FINE TUNE COMPROMISES

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:10.497
AND LET ME JUST SAY MORE

01:51:10.563 --> 01:51:12.132
EXPLICITLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:51:12.198 --> 01:51:14.000
GRANDFATHERING I THINK WE ALL

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:16.703
UNDERSTAND. THAT IF THERE WERE

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:20.540
EXPECTATIONS BY DEVELOPERS- IT

01:51:20.607 --> 01:51:22.175
IS ABSOLUTELY FAIR TO SAY THAT

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:24.744
THOSE EXPECTATIONS OUGHT TO BE

01:51:24.811 --> 01:51:29.416
RESPECTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND

01:51:29.482 --> 01:51:30.016
AS WE STATED IN THE ANALYSIS-

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.051
CLIMB THE CHANGES ARE. REAL AND-

01:51:31.117 --> 01:51:32.952
THESE. MAY HAVE BEEN SET AT A

01:51:33.019 --> 01:51:35.255
TIME BEFORE WE SAW. THE HAVOC

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:38.792
OF WILDFIRES IN RECENT DAYS AND

01:51:38.858 --> 01:51:40.393
LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS I DO

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:42.495
THINK WE NEED A VERY FINE TUNED

01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:43.763
BALANCE AND I'VE BEEN PUSHING

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:45.932
BOTH SIDES TO CONSIDER THAT. ON

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:47.133
THE LANGUAGE OF FEASIBLE

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.435
ACHIEVABLE FOR MAJORITY

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:49.936
DEVELOPMENTS- I CERTAINLY

01:51:50.003 --> 01:51:51.704
APPRECIATE. THE PERSPECTIVE

01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:53.173
THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:54.874
RIGHT BUT THE EXACT RIGHT POINT

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:56.276
WE WANT TO END UP. BUT I WAS

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:58.044
ALSO I WOULD ALSO SUGGESTED I

01:51:58.111 --> 01:51:59.045
DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS ALL

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:00.814
OR NOTHING HERE. WE'VE GOT A

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.183
STRIKE A BALANCE AND SO A PART

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:04.417
OF MY COMMENTS TODAY IS TO

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:06.352
REALLY ENCOURAGE. IF THIS BILL

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:08.488
MOVES FORWARD- CONTINUE

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:09.289
CONVERSATION BECAUSE TO THE

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:11.124
SENATORS POINT. I DO THINK IF

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:13.026
WE DON'T RESOLVE THESE ISSUES-

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:14.928
IT WILL LIKELY NOT BODE WELL.

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:16.563
ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND I

01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:18.131
KNOW THAT OUR COLLEAGUES ARE

01:52:18.198 --> 01:52:19.232
REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THIS ONE

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:22.302
SO- WITH THAT- I WILL BE

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:24.471
SUPPORTING THIS TODAY- AGAIN I

01:52:24.537 --> 01:52:25.705
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:27.507
AUTHOR BECAUSE HE WORKS. AS

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:29.342
HARD AS ANYONE IN THIS BUSINESS

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:31.611
TO FIND THOSE BALANCES- I THINK

01:52:31.678 --> 01:52:32.912
THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS WILL BE

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:34.080
IF THIS BILL MOVES FOR WILL BE

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:35.949
CRITICAL- AND I'M HAPPY TO

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:37.317
ENGAGE IN. PART OF WHAT I WANT

01:52:37.383 --> 01:52:39.886
TO SIGNAL IS MY OPENNESS TO

01:52:39.953 --> 01:52:41.121
ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS HERE TO

01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:42.555
GO TO LANDED AT THE RIGHT PLACE

01:52:42.622 --> 01:52:44.357
CERTAINLY DO NOT THINK THAT. WE

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:46.126
HAVE PROBABLY A FINAL PRODUCT

01:52:46.192 --> 01:52:47.627
COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE.

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:48.795
BUT I THINK ON THE OTHER HAND

01:52:48.862 --> 01:52:51.264
THE URGENCY OF THE MATTER OF

01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:53.166
THIS IDEA THT SOMEHOW WE HOLD

01:52:53.233 --> 01:52:54.767
THIS FOR FOURTH YEAR THAT ALSO

01:52:54.834 --> 01:52:57.070
DOESN'T SIT EXACTLY WELL- BUT

01:52:57.137 --> 01:52:58.671
WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:52:58.738 --> 01:52:59.639
OUT THE RIGHT ANSWER SO- WITH

01:52:59.706 --> 01:53:01.608
THAT- AND LEICESTER ANY FINAL

02:03:22.261 --> 02:03:22.862
ELEMENT OF ALLOWING LOCAL

02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:25.231

02:03:25.297 --> 02:03:27.233
INFORMATION THAT CAN BE HELPFUL

02:03:27.299 --> 02:03:27.733

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.169
RESTRICT THEM FROM. YOUR LOCAL

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:32.404

THAT'S THAT HAPPENED TO BE A

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:41.547
LOCAL AGENCIES WILL STILL BE

02:03:41.614 --> 02:03:43.182
ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT. AND

02:03:43.249 --> 02:03:44.450
THEY NEED TO DO AND DO THE

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:46.685
