ACTIVE AND HEALTHY LIFE. IT

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.089
DOESN'T S. INCLUDE ME THAT YOUR

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:39.492
HUNGER. I COULD MEAN THAT YOUR

YOU'RE HAVING TO REALLY CUT

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.528
CORNERS YOU KNOW STOP BUYING

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:45.031
FRESH FRUITS BUT THAN LIKE THAT

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.599
THAT'S WAS BROUGHT MEASURE FOOD

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.601
AND SECURITY. AND WE'RE ALSO IN

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.170
TO LOOK HUNGER WHICH DURING THE

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.905
PANDEMIC BEEN MEASURED BY

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.708
ASKING FAMILIES. DO YOU HAVE

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.043
ENOUGH TO EAT AND A FAMILY SAYS

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:59.412
I WE SOMETIMES ARE OFTEN DON'T

00:07:59.478 --> 00:07:59.979
HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. THEY'RE

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:10.790
CODED AS- AGAIN HUNGRY. THE

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:11.424
JUSTICE OF THE STAGE ON THE EVE

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.893
OF THE CO PANDA. FOOD AND

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.261
SECURITY IN OTHER MEASURE OF

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:19.732
GOOD HOW. WALKWAY LOW THE TEN

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.702
PER WELL. ARGUABLY STILL TO BUT

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.136
A 10% OF CALIFORNIA OVERALL

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:27.406
WE'RE- THAT. AND LITTLE LESSON

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:33.546
4% WORKS. HUNGER. DURING COLD

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:42.588
ED. DOES ARE OUR CORE ELEVATED.

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.290
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC FROM

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.560
APRIL TO JULY ALMOST ONE OUT OF

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.395
FOUR ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:50.229
REPORTED THAT THEY WERE FOOD

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.532
INSECURE AND 11% REPORTED THAT

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.268
THEY WERE EXPERIENCING ACTUAL

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:57.136
HUNGER IN OUR HOUSEHOLDS. THOSE

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.471
NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN A LITTLE

00:08:58.537 --> 00:08:59.939
BIT IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER IS

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:02.608
THE ECONOMY STARTED TO REBOUND

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:04.777
A LITTLE BAD. AT CETERA. UP TO

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:08.381
ABOUT 22% OVERALL AND 10% BOB

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:11.183
EXPERIENCING HUNGER. THIS IS

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.218
WHAT FOOD HARDSHIP IN

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.020
CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE IN

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.821
SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER FOR

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.056
DIFFERENT GROUPS SO WE START

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.424
WITH THE OVERALL GROUP WHICH I

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:20.259
SHOWED YOU ON THE LAST LINE AND

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:21.761
WE CAN COME OVER TO FAMILIES

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.829
ADULTS WITH CHILDREN. YOU CAN

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.131
SEE THAT ADULTS WITH CHILDREN

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:27.133
ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:30.303
FOOD HARDSHIP- NEARLY THREE OUT

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:31.904
OF TEN ARE REPORTING THREE IN

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.373
SECURITY 15% ARE REPORTING

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.076
HUNGER. AMONG THE ELDERLY WHAT

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:38.244
THEIR RATES ARE LOWER THEY'RE

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.846
STILL QUITE ELEVATED 16% OF THE

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.148
L. OF ELDERLY CALIFORNIANS

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.049
REPORT THAT THEY'RE FOOD

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.318
INSECURE. ABOUT 6% SAID THEY

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:48.220
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. THIS

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:50.489
IS WHAT THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE-

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.925
BY RACE AND ETHNICITY ACROSS

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:55.061
CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN SEE WHEN WE

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:57.063
THINK ABOUT FOOD SECURITY.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:59.432
ABOUT 15% OF WHITE AND ASIAN

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:00.766
RESPONDENTS SAY THAT THEIR FOOD

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.368
IN SECURE AND THOSE RATES ARE

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.170
ABOUT DOUBLE. FOR BLACK

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:06.706
FAMILIES AND FOR HISPANIC OR

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.975
LATINO FAMILIES. WHEN WE COME

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:11.243
OVER TO THINK ABOUT- ARE YOU

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.877
SOMETIMES ARE OFTEN NOT GETTING

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:13.879
ENOUGH TO EAT. THOSE RATES ARE

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:16.916
ABOUT 6% FOR WHITES AND ASIANS

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.884
AND OUT. MORE THAN MORE THAN

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:21.687
TWICE THAT FOR BLACKS AND

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:23.289
HISPANICS OR LET'S MEDINA

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:26.392
FAMILY. I CAN ALSO SHOW YOU

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.627
THIS- FOR ADULTS WITH CHILDREN

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:29.862
AND YOU CAN SEE IS VERY SIMILAR

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:31.297
PATTERNS BUT I'LL JUST POINT

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:33.599
HIGHLIGHT ONE NUMBER HERE.

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.668
ABOUT ONE THIRD OF. THE

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.703
HISPANIC OR LATINO ADULTS WITH

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.537
CHILDREN SAID THAT THE FOOD

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:41.741
SECURE AND NEARLY ONE OUT OF

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:42.942
FIVE SAID THAT THERE'S NOT

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.711
ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT IN THEIR-

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:47.346
AND THEIR HOUSES RIGHT NOW.

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.681
HERE'S WHAT THE- RESULTS LOOK

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.383
LIKE FOR ELDERLY ADULTS YOU SEE

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.984
THAT SAME PATTERN JUST A LITTLE

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.652
BIT LOWER BUT STILL VERY VERY

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:58.124
ELEVATED. JUST FOR CONTEXT- THE

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.792
RATES IN CALIFORNIA TRACK THE

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:01.527
NATIONAL AVERAGE QUITE CLOSELY

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.462
SO WE'RE SEEING THIS ALL ACROSS

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:04.964
THE NATION SOME STATES ARE

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.866
EXPERIENCING A WORSE SOME

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:07.566
STATES ARE DOING A LITTLE BIT

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:09.502
BETTER AND CALIFORNIA'S JUST

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.637
RIGHT AT THAT AVERAGE. IF YOU

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:13.172
WANT THINGS TO NOTE THERE IS A

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.641
STRONG RELIANCE ON FREE MEALS

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.576
DURING THIS PANDEMIC ABOUT ONE

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.011
OUT OF EIGHT CALIFORNIANS

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:20.946
REPORT RECEIVING A FREE MEAL IN

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.415
THE PAST WEEK. AND HERE'S WHAT

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.583
IT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE OVERALL

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.419
OF FILMS WITH CHILDREN ARE MORE

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:28.220
LIKELY ABOUT ONE IN FIVE. SAID

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:29.522
THEY GOT A FREE MEAL THE LAST

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:32.124
WEEK AND A LITTLE BIT LOWER BOB

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.926
FOR THE ELDERLY COMMUNITY. AND

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.061
WHEN WE COMPARE THAT TO THE

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:36.629
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC IN

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:37.563
THE RATES ACTUALLY LOOK QUITE

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.799
SIMILAR. TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:42.568
IS A JUST A TREMENDOUS DEMAND

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.003
FOR THREE MEALS A TREMENDOUS

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.871
RELIANCE ON CHARITY FOOD-

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.773
THAT'S BEEN SUSTAIN FOR QUITE A

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.643
LONG TIME. JUST SO YOU GET A

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.078
SENSE OF WHERE THESE THREE

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:54.280
MEALS ARE COMING FROM. THE BLUE

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.915
LINE IT'S THEIR THE BLUE BARS

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:57.616
ARE FROM THE SCHOOL AND THE-

00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:59.552
RED. BURKE FROM UP FROM A FOOD

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:01.353
BANK AND THERE ARE OTHER

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.555
OPTIONS AS WELL THAT THESE ARE

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.223
SLIPPING TO AND YOU CAN SEE OF

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.424
COURSE FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:06.559
ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SAY

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:07.626
THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN A FREE MEAL

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:10.463
FROM OF FOOD FROM A SCHOOL. AND

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.331
OF THE BANK IS BASICALLY PRETTY

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.768
CONSTANT ACROSS ALL SORTS OF

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.736
CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS WHAT

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:19.371
THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE BY RACE

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:22.374
OR ETHNICITY. YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:24.443
I'M GONNA GET RID LATINOS IN

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.212
ADDITION TO EXPERIENCING MORE

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:27.746
FOOD AND SECURITY ARE ALSO

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:32.751
RELYING MORE ON ON CHARITY SAID.

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:33.953
COMING TO A CONCLUSION IS

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:37.022
SERVICE QUICKLY AS HE CAN. THIS

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.224
IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.426
MANY CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.328
YOU. ADDICTING THAT THEY WILL

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:44.063
CONTINUE TO- EXPERIENCE

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.099
HARDSHIP THIS FIRST SET OF BARS

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.969
IT SAYS- ASKS ARE YOU CONFIDENT

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:51.604
THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PAY FOR

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.638
THE COULD YOU NEED OVER THE

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.106
NEXT MONTH AND THIS IS THE

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:55.641
SHARE OF CALIFORNIANS WHO SAY

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.209
THAT THEY'RE- EITHER NOT EITHER

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:58.677
MODERATELY OR VERY CONFIDENT

00:12:58.744 --> 00:12:59.979
THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO. AFFORD

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:01.780
THE FOOD THEY NEED YOU CAN SEE

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.048
YOU KNOW THOSE NUMBERS ARE YOU

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.917
KNOW MORE THAN ONE OUT OF THREE

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:06.785
OF FOR BLACKS AND HISPANIC OR

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:09.655
LATINO ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.090
SIMILARLY WE CAN THINK ABOUT

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:12.324
THE SHARE OF PEOPLE WHO SAY

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.527
THAT THEY ARE. NOT CONFIDENT

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:15.127
THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PAY

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:16.629
THEIR NEXT RENT PAYMENT OR

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.097
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS THESE ARE

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.532
VERY VERY HIGH NUMBERS YOU

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:23.636
KNOW- ALMOST ONE OUT OF FIVE

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:26.305
CALIFORNIANS OVERALL. A SIMILAR.

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:27.506
MORE THAN ONE IN TEN

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.341
CALIFORNIA. FAMILIES REPORT

00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:31.343
BEING BEHIND CURRENTLY ON THEIR

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.811
HOUSING PAYMENTS NOT EVEN

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.780
THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT PAYMENT.

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.315
RELIEF PAYMENTS HAVE CERTAINLY

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:37.883
HELP I KNOW THAT OTHERS WILL BE

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.652
TALKING MORE ABOUT THIS.

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:41.554
CALFRESH RESPONSE HAS BEEN

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.788
STRONG AS HAS SNAPPED

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:45.357
NATIONWIDE. THERE WAS A SHARP

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:46.058
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.327
FAMILIES. SERVED BY THIS

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:50.930
PROGRAM UP 20% BOB BY JUNE IT'S

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:52.865
COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT SINCE

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.633
THEN BUT STILL QUITE ELEVATED.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.603
THE PANDEMIC EBT PROGRAM. HAS

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.139
BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE. FOOD

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.106
HARDSHIP FOR FAMILIES THAT

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:05.144
RECEIVE THAT IT ALSO BRINGS IN-

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:05.744
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO

00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:07.279
THE STATE. AND THEN FINALLY I

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:08.747
WANT TO SAY IT'S A QUICK THING

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:11.150
ABOUT WEST. OF THE PURPLE BARS

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:13.953
HERE ARE EIGHT. U. S. WICKS

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:16.055
CASELOADS AND THE BLUE BARS OUR

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.389
CASELOADS IN CALIFORNIA YOU'LL

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:21.994
NOTICE THAT. IN RECENT YEARS

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:22.528
WHICH CASELOADS HAVE BEEN

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:23.829
DECLINING. ALL ACROSS THE

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:26.465
NATION WITH THE DECLINING MORE

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:29.201
QUICKLY IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.402
THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.838
THESE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP WITH

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:33.939
PARTICIPATIONS GONE UP IN

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:36.775
CALIFORNIA BY ABOUT 11% OF ITS

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:38.711
AND MORE RESPONSIVE THAN THE

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:40.746
REST OF THE NATION HAS DONE BUT

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:43.716
IT'S STILL. YOUR LACK QUITE A

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:46.518
BIT COMPARED TO THE NATION AS A

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:46.986
WHOLE IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:49.154

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:48.425
HUNDRED THOUSAND I BELIEVE THAT

WITH PENDING THE SSI CASH ON

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:06.810
POLICY WHAT IS THAT. WHILE MOST

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:08.545
FAMILIES WOULD NECESSARILY BE

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:11.048
BETTER OFF BY RECEIVING THE

ADDITIONAL CALFRESH BENEFIT.

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:14.551
MINORITY FAMILIES WOULD BE

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.753
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BECAUSE THE

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.289
SSI INCOME RECEIVED BY THOSE

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:21.058
INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE COUNTED AS

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.859
INCOME FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:24.761

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.930
REDUCE OR BENEFIT OR A

THEY WERE ON. THE OLD POLICY.

00:49:58.929 --> 00:49:59.429

00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:50.674
SOME CONCERNS THAT. YOU'RE KIND

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.008

CERTAINLY THE PRIMARY CONCERN

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:16.700
IS THAT AS YOUR FIRST PANEL

EXPRESSES A CONCERN BUT IT IS

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:20.297
PERHAPS A SURPRISE- INSTEAD TO

ENROLLMENT MIGHT BE DUE TO SOME

00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:03.139

INDICATE THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN-

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:09.546

VULNERABLE. IT'S A VERY

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.325
DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER

00:54:55.392 --> 00:55:00.864
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- CERTAINLY

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.000

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:04.694
INDICATIVE EITHER OF THE FACT

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:57.959
BUDGET PROJECTED A DECLINE.

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.694
THAT CAN'T DECLINE IT ACTUALLY

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:01.830
STARTED BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:03.165
FOR CALIFORNIA. WITH THE

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:05.534
EXCEPTION OF LAST YEAR AND THE

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.668
EXPANSION OF THE EFFORT BY

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:08.670
POPULATION. THEY'RE GONNA STUDY

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.205
THE QUIET AND THE REASON FOR

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:11.740
THAT WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:14.209
IMPROVING ECONOMY. THAT HAD

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:15.177
BEEN LONG SUSTAINED OVER THOSE

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:18.914
YEARS. SO OVER NINETEEN TWENTY

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:19.848
NINETEEN TWENTY AS WELL AS THE

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:21.383
CURRENT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:22.384
TWENTY ONE AND- NEVER BEEN UP

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:24.152
PROJECTED DROP OF ABOUT THREE

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:26.988
POINT THREE PERCENT. AND BY

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:29.624
NEXT JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:31.560
ARE- CASELOAD PROJECTIONS OF

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:32.360
THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS NOT

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:34.529
INDIVIDUALS. WAS PROJECTED AT

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.998
ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. AS OF.

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.967
THE END OF LAST MONTH THE MOST

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:42.370
RECENT DATA- UPDATED- IN LATE

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.306
OCTOBER. WE WERE CARRYING TWO

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:45.907
POINT FIVE MILLION CASES THAT

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:47.642
YOU CAN BE QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL.

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:49.477
DIFFERENCE NOT JUST IN SORT OF

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:51.513
ABSOLUTE GROWTH BUT ALSO IF YOU

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.581
THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:54.382
EXPECTING TO SEE THAT CONTINUE

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:56.151
TO QUIET. NOW HAS REVERSED AND

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:57.485
GONE WELL ABOVE WHERE WE

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.120
THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD BE. AND

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:01.022
SO- COUNTY FOR THAT SAME KIND

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.324
THEMSELVES WORK WERE.

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:03.858
STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.760
THEY SHOULD BE DOING- FOLLOWING

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:06.995
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.196
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BOARD

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:11.299
OF SUPERVISORS. TO TRY TO KEEP

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:13.235
THE DOORS OPEN EITHER LITERALLY

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:14.636
OR FIGURATIVELY AS MUCH AS

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.838
POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:17.706
COMMUNITIES CAN STILL GAIN

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:19.040
ACCESS TO THE AND OTHER

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:22.510
PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE. THE

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:24.279
MOST OF THE COUNTIES TODAY HAVE

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:26.448
AT LEAST ONE OFFICE OPEN AND

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:28.183
MANY HAVE ALL OR MOST OF THEIR

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.885
OFFICES OPEN. AT TIMES- THEY

01:21:30.952 --> 01:21:32.520

REQUIRE APPOINTMENTS. FOR

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.162
SERVICES THAT MIGHT TAKE A I

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.864
BIT LONGER ACTUAL FILING APPLE.

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:43.999

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:46.668

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:49.337
STAFF ON HAND TO DO. IN PERSON

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.906
TRIAGE OR END OR SORT OF WALK

UP WINDOWS AND WALK UP SERVICE

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:56.177
FOR FOLKS TO COME TO THAT- LAW

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:57.512
OFFICE EVEN AT THE OFFICE MAY

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.281
NOT OTHERWISE BE GENERALLY OPEN

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:01.283
TO THE PUBLIC. THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:02.951
HELP THEM IN A DISTANCE AWAY

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:05.887
THAT WILL ENABLE THEIR SERVICES

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.188
TO BE PROVIDED TO THEM. WE'VE

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.423
ALSO SEEN A PRACTICE USED

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:10.058
INCREASINGLY ACROSS THE COUNTY

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.259
THE FACT I KNOW OF ONLY ONE

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:12.594
COUNTY HAT DIDN'T HAVE IT IN

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:15.397
PLACE- IN A RECENT SURVEY. AND

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:16.665
THAT WAS A SMALL COUNTY THAT

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.967
NEVER CLOSE- IF THE USER DROP

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.403
BOXES. SO BOXES WERE

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:22.437
INDIVIDUALS CAN DROP

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:25.106
APPLICATIONS VERIFICATION THAT

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:25.874
ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THAT

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.276
PROCESS SAYING- INFORMATION

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.544
ABOUT CHANGES THAT HAVE

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.513
OCCURRED REDETERMINATION. AND

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:32.814
THINGS LIKE THAT SO THEY CAN

01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:33.982
LEAVE THAT INFORMATION AT THE

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:36.117
COUNTY FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:38.820
TO PROCESS. BOND NUMBER OF THE

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:40.789
COUNTY OFFICES DO HAVE WORKERS-

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:42.691
ON WHAT SHIFT QUITE OFTEN

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:43.692
PRESERVING THAT SOCIAL

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:45.427
DISTANCING THAT IS NOT OPEN TO

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:46.528
THE PUBLIC SO THERE ARE PEOPLE

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:47.762
THERE WHO CAN. GET THE

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.164

AND STILL CONTINUE TO PROCESS

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:53.068
THEM AND OF COURSE IN ADDITION

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.936
TO THOSE-IN PERSON SERVICES

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.938

AND MEDICAL SERVICES-

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:16.658
OVERWHELMINGLY WHEN WE ARE THE

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:17.826
COUNTY- IF YOU'RE NOT FULLY-

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:19.861
OPEN WHY THAT THE NUMBER ONE

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.162
ANSWER WAS BASED WAS DUE TO THE

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.397
PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS IN THEIR

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:25.066
COUNTIES. ON END OR ORDERS FROM

THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. SOME

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:28.903
DO SO REPORT STAFFING ISSUES I

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:30.205
THINK THOSE WERE MORE IF YOU

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:32.540
EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC BUT WE

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:33.775
ARE STILL HEARING THAT COUNTIES

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.910
HAVE- A NUMBER OF THEIR-

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.912
INDIVIDUAL STAFF WHO MAY HAVE

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:39.814
OVER ABILITIES. TO COAL BED

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:42.050
THEY MAY BE OUT ON LEAVE- THEY

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:43.518
MAY HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO THE

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:45.253
INTERNET ESPECIALLY THE RURAL

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.187
AREAS TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:48.490
HOME- AND THERE'S ONGOING

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.125
CONCERN ESPECIALLY I THINK WE

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:52.060
WOULD BE AT INCREASING NOW. OF

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:54.863
A CONCERN OVER INFECTION AND-

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.798
ACTUALLY GETTING THE VIRUS IF

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.367
THEY GO IN- AND THERE HAVE BEEN

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:01.236
SOME LIMITED EXAMPLES OF THEM

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.370
TRANSMISSIONS OCCURRING IN OUR

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:04.606
OFFICES. BUT OVERWHELMINGLY

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:06.541
IT'S BASED ON. WHERE THE COUNTY

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:11.279
IS AND WHAT THE PUBLIC. HEALTH

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:12.280

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:13.448
THERE'S AN GOING TO BE. THAT

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:17.218
THE PLACE TO LOOK THAT- IN OUR

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.620
THAT'S OF OUR REGION OUT

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:19.320
STATIONING THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:21.122

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:22.957
AND BY THEIR COMMUNITY MEANS.

01:24:23.024 --> 01:24:24.392

BETWEEN. MARCH AND SEPTEMBER

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.010
ALONE. SOME OF THE AREAS THAT

THEY COUNTY THAT. FOR I DO CAN.

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:20.381
AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT'S

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:21.850
COMING NEXT WEEK SO I THINK

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:22.717
YOU'RE A GREAT PERIOD OF

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.385
UNCERTAINTY AS OTHERS HAVE

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.187
TESTIFIED AND- AS OF AS OF

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:27.489
COURSE THE THAT YOU'RE IN THE

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:30.225
MEMBERS NOW- CERTAINLY WE'RE

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.726
HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.461
WORK WITH THE STATE AND THE

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:34.929
NEW. THE INCOMING FEDERAL

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.364
ADMINISTRATION TO EXPAND THE

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:38.166
FLEXIBILITY AS AND SORT OF

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:39.901
RESTART SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.336
THAT WE THOUGHT EARLIER IN THE

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:44.105
PANDEMIC- THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:46.074
OF STOPS AND STARTS. TO SOME OF

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.108
THOSE FEDERALLY ALLOWED

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:48.109
FLEXIBILITY IS AND I THINK

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:50.578
YEAH. UNDERSTANDABLE RELUCTANCE

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:51.513
ON THE PART OF THE

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:53.014
ADMINISTRATION TO GO FURTHER

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:54.249
THAN WHAT IS ALLOWED BY THE

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.683
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:57.519
COULD LOSE FUNDING- AND HAVE TO

01:25:57.585 --> 01:26:00.154
PAY. BACK OR PAY BENEFITS OUT

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.956
OF OUR POCKETS AND AGAIN THAT

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.258
DOESN'T APPLY IN THE CALFRESH

01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:05.493
WORLD- BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.328
THAT THERE ARE. SOME AREAS

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:08.830
WHERE THERE'S NOT UNIFORMITY

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.331
OUR MEDIC HEALTH RULES ARE

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:11.933
DIFFERENT FROM CALFRESH.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.334
UNUSUALLY HELP PRESSING CAL

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:14.569
WORK SO THE SAME BUT THERE'S

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:15.403
EVEN BEEN SOME DIFFERENCES

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.572
THERE. I DON'T THINK WE FAULT

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.007
THE STATE FOR THE DECISIONS

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:20.675
THAT IT NEEDED TO MAKE IN ORDER

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:22.010
TO DO THAT. BUT STRIVING

01:26:22.076 --> 01:26:23.211
TOGETHER FOR AS MUCH OF THAT

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:25.246
UNIFORMITY OF POSSIBLE AND

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.781
ADVOCATING FOR PERMISSION TO

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.583
MAKE THE PROGRAM'S UNIFORM AND

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:31.119
HOW WE- TREAT YOUR GOT YOU WHY

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:32.687
INCOME AND THE DIFFERENT.

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:34.422
BENEFITS DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:35.757
BEEN RECEIVED WHICH DIFFER IN

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:37.592
SOME CASES. ACROSS THE

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:40.562
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. ON ALLOWING

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:42.997
SIMILARLY FLEXIBLE INTERVIEWING

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:44.666
ACROSS THE THREE PROGRAMS AS

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:47.835
NEEDED- ARE A FEW OF THE AREAS

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:50.038
THERE- AND THEN FINALLY- IN

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.606
THAT AREA. THIS KIND OF FIGURE

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:52.974
OUT HOW TO MINIMIZE THE DOUBLE

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.143
WORKLOAD FOR OUR STAFF. ONE

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:59.914
THING WE REALLY APPRECIATED.

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:01.716
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWED US

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.451
TO KEEP PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:05.853
WE WERE ABLE TO JUST BASICALLY-

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.789
CONSIDER. SEMI ANNUAL REPORTS

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:09.157
THAT ARE REQUIRED BY EVERY

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:11.392
HOUSEHOLD TO BE GOOD WE DIDN'T

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:12.860
EVEN HAVE TO ASK FOR THEM OR

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:14.796
PROCESS POUNDS. ON AND WE JUST

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:16.064
BASICALLY WERE ABLE TO KIND OF

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.699
STEP PEOPLE FORWARD. TO THE

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:18.666
POINT WHERE NOW WE ARE BACK

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:19.901
PROCESSING THERE IN A

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.769
REDETERMINATION. IN THE MATTER

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.738

REDETERMINATION PAPERWORK THAT

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:30.845
WE RECEIVED. SO THERE'S SOME

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.246
DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE PROGRAMS

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:34.482

ORDER SOME OF THE LESSONS

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:47.787
LEARNED IN THE PAST THREE

01:53:47.854 --> 01:53:49.756
MONTHS AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:52.258
FUTURE CHALLENGES THAT YOUR

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:56.462
CONSTITUENTS CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:53:56.529 --> 01:53:58.531
THIS IS A BIT YOU COULD HAVE A

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.266
THESIS ON LESSONS LEARNED. I

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:04.037
THINK. IT'S CLEAR THAT. WHAT WE

01:54:04.103 --> 01:54:07.473
SEE IN OUR CASELOAD IS A

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:09.008
REFLECTION OF THE DEPTH OF THE

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:10.543
NEEDS THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:13.112
EXPERIENCING AND SO- IT IS

01:54:13.179 --> 01:54:15.281
CLEAR THAT CALFRESH PLAYS A

01:54:15.348 --> 01:54:17.250
CRITICAL ROLE IN HELPING TO

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:20.486
MEET NEEDS AND- ENSURING THAT

01:54:20.553 --> 01:54:21.054
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.522
CULTURALLY COMPETENT OF FOOD

01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:23.990
ACCESS WHEN YOU HAVE BENEFITS

01:54:24.057 --> 01:54:25.992
THAT YOU CAN USE AT A STORE

01:54:26.059 --> 01:54:26.859
YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.528
CHOICES AND SO TOGETHER WITH

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:31.064
OTHER RESOURCES THAT'S HOW WE

01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:32.865
HELP. PEOPLE MEET THEIR NEEDS

01:54:32.932 --> 01:54:34.934
IN A WAY THAT- SATISFIED

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:35.735
SATISFIED THINGS LIKE CULTURAL

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:37.070
DIFFERENCES I THINK IT

01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:38.504
DEFINITELY IT'S CLEAR THAT WE

01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:41.207
PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN-

01:54:41.274 --> 01:54:42.242
ECONOMIC RECOVERY AT THE

01:54:42.308 --> 01:54:43.810
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND AT THE AT

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:45.445
THE LOCAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF

01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:46.946
BUSINESS SUPPORT I THINK WE

01:54:47.013 --> 01:54:49.015
LEARNED ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:51.084
SIDE THAT- THERE ARE

01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:52.685
POSSIBILITIES THAT HELPED US

01:54:52.752 --> 01:54:54.687
RESPOND AND YOU KNOW IF WE

01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:57.156
COULD ASK- AS A KHAKI SUIT

01:54:57.223 --> 01:54:58.858
SUGGESTION FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND

01:54:58.925 --> 01:54:59.926
WHAT'S AVAILABLE IT'S AROUND

01:54:59.993 --> 01:55:01.661
THE CONSISTENCY RIGHT. FOR A

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:03.363
LONG TIME WE WERE ASKING FOR

01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:04.664
FLEXIBILITY IS ON A MONTH TO

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:06.366
MONTH BASIS WHICH DIDN'T ALLOW

01:55:06.432 --> 01:55:09.102
US TO REALLY PLAN LONG TERM AND

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:10.870
THINK ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:13.239
TO RESPOND TO AN ONGOING

01:55:13.306 --> 01:55:15.208
DISASTER OF THIS MAGNITUDE

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:17.744
GREAT THAT IS BOUND TO LAST FOR

01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:19.779
THE NEXT YEAR OR SO WELL WE

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:21.247
JUST IMPLEMENTED FOR EXAMPLE

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:22.715
INTERVIEW FLEXIBILITIES ALL THE

01:55:22.782 --> 01:55:24.717
WAY THROUGH JIM. THAT PROVIDE

01:55:24.784 --> 01:55:26.486
NOT ONLY A STABILITY FOR

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:27.920
CLIENTS BUT ALSO FOR COUNTY

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.590
PARTNERS IN BEING ABLE TO PLAN

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:31.924
TO THAT TYPE OF ADMINISTRATIVE

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:33.526
RELIEF SO THAT THE MONTH TO

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:35.762
MONTH WORK THAT WE HAD TO DO

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:41.401
WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. WAS

01:55:41.467 --> 01:55:42.001
VERY VERY CHALLENGING. TO SAY

01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:43.903
THE AND WE'RE FOR TO SOME. IN

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:44.804
IN THOSE OPTION BEING A BILL-

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:47.240

01:55:47.307 --> 01:55:49.509
BENEFIT ADEQUACY BUT LOTS OF

THAT WAS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM

01:55:53.012 --> 01:55:53.946
RIGHT WE HAD IT WAS

01:55:54.013 --> 01:55:57.050
UNPRECEDENTED. NO NO STATE HAD

01:55:57.116 --> 01:55:59.352
DONE THAT RIGHT WE DID NOT HAVE

01:55:59.419 --> 01:56:00.853
KIND OF A- ALL OF THE

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.555
INFORMATION WE HAVE NOW TO

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:03.690
ENSURE THAT WHEN WE GO OUT FOR

01:56:03.756 --> 01:56:04.891
THIS NEXT ROUND FOR AN ENTIRE

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:06.259
SCHOOL YEAR. WE ARE BETTER

01:56:06.326 --> 01:56:08.428
EQUIPPED TO MEET. THE NEEDS OF

01:56:08.494 --> 01:56:09.762
FAMILIES NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF

01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:11.397
GETTING CARDS OUT BUT FOR

01:56:11.464 --> 01:56:13.566
EXAMPLE- MAKING SURE THEY

THEY MAY NOT BE ON CALPERS IS

01:56:16.936 --> 01:56:18.571
MAYBE THE FIRST EBT CARD THAT

01:56:18.638 --> 01:56:19.639
THEY HAD AND SO WE LEARNED A

01:56:19.706 --> 01:56:21.441
LOT EVEN ABOUT SOME. BASIC

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:23.409

OPERATION SO I THINK THERE ARE

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:30.083
QUITE A FEW CAN LOOK ACROSS A

01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:31.384

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.743
NATIONALLY- ONE OF THE MAIN

02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:33.612
REASONS WE DID DESIGN ESTAS

02:12:33.679 --> 02:12:34.646

ELDERLY THAT HAVE PASSED SO

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:41.186
THAT HAS BEEN A DRIVER OF THE

02:12:41.253 --> 02:12:43.088
GREAT PLACE PROGRAMS IS JUST

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:45.223
THAT HOW DO WE BEST ENSURE

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:47.793
THAT- THE PEOPLE WITH THE MOST

02:12:47.859 --> 02:12:49.061
VULNERABLE THEY HAVE NO OTHER.

02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:51.663
OPTION FOR GETTING SAID- AND

02:12:51.730 --> 02:12:52.864

INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING FED-

ARE NOT PART OF THAT SYSTEM

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:00.138
STATE BANK I DON'T HAVE ANY

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:02.007

02:13:02.074 --> 02:13:07.245
OF GRAVESITES. PROGRAM THAT WAS

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:08.447
ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS. AND

02:13:08.513 --> 02:13:10.315
MADAM CHAIR KATHY CENTER IF I

MIGHT ALSO. IN A THIS ONE FOR

02:13:12.317 --> 02:13:14.553
CW. I THINK- WHEN WE- TALK TO

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:16.321
K. OF WHY. WHAT THEY WERE DOING

02:13:16.388 --> 02:13:19.091
AS FAR AS OUR REACH. IT WAS

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:20.726
MAYBE NOT COMPLETELY ACROSS THE

02:13:20.792 --> 02:13:22.728
BOARD BUT NEARLY EVERY COUNTY

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:24.563
THAT I WAS AWARE HAD A PROJECT

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:26.398
ROOM KEY. PROGRAM WHICH OF

02:13:26.465 --> 02:13:29.201
COURSE IS- TARGETED AT SIMILAR

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:30.435
STRUGGLING UNDERSERVED

02:13:30.502 --> 02:13:31.536
POPULATIONS HOMELESS

02:13:31.603 --> 02:13:33.205
POPULATIONS THAT WOULD.

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:35.140
TYPICALLY BE VERY VULNERABLE TO

02:13:35.207 --> 02:13:38.210
ILLNESS- AND POTENTIAL THAT.

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:39.311
ARE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF CALL

02:13:39.378 --> 02:13:41.012
GOOD GOOD BECAUSE OF OTHER JUST

02:13:41.079 --> 02:13:44.249
STRUCTURAL ISSUES- AS WELL DIE

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:46.385
AND YOU KNOW AND A LACK OF

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:49.121
HOUSING SUPPORT. THEY HAVE BEEN

02:13:49.187 --> 02:13:51.223
DOING THAT OUR REACH IN CONCERT

02:13:51.289 --> 02:13:52.791
WITH THE PROJECT ROOM KEY.

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:54.760

CALFRESH. CONNECT THEM WITH

02:13:59.498 --> 02:14:00.866
OTHER SERVICES THAT THEY MIGHT

02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:02.334
BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND I THINK

02:14:02.401 --> 02:14:03.902
IT'S DRIVEN FROM THE SAME KINDS

02:14:03.969 --> 02:14:06.438
OF CONCERNS THAT- A ROOF OVER

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:08.306
SOMEONE'S HEAD AND YOU KNOW

02:14:08.373 --> 02:14:10.342
THAT THAT PROJECT ROOM KEY- AND

02:14:10.409 --> 02:14:11.510
I PROJECT HOME KEY AS IS

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:13.378
MORPHING INTO. IS REALLY

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:15.814
SIGNIFICANT AND HELPS SO MUCH

02:14:15.881 --> 02:14:18.016
TO AVOID THOSE KINDS OF REALLY

02:14:18.083 --> 02:14:20.051
SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS SAYS. AND

02:14:20.118 --> 02:14:21.319
EVEN PROJECT PREMATURE DEATHS

02:14:21.386 --> 02:14:23.321
THAT WE SEE. BUT IT'S NOT THE

02:14:23.388 --> 02:14:25.157
ONLY THING WE ALSO NEED TO

02:14:25.223 --> 02:14:26.458
BRING THESE OTHER SERVICES AND

02:14:26.525 --> 02:14:28.493
SUPPORTS TO BEAR AND SO ON. I

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.562
WAS. REALLY HAPPY WHEN I WAS

NUMBERS RUN. AND SO HAVING

02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:54.966
PEOPLE WHO HAVE. FOUND

02:17:55.033 --> 02:17:56.868
ELIGIBILITY THAT PROGRAM WHICH

02:17:56.935 --> 02:17:58.269

02:17:59.337 --> 02:18:00.572
FIRST LANGUAGE I WE AS WE

AND THAT'S GROW I MEAN THAT'S

02:18:16.154 --> 02:18:17.922
CONFUSING OUR WORKERS LET

PARTICIPATION IN MAINLY

02:38:29.867 --> 02:38:32.135

02:38:32.202 --> 02:38:33.837
STUDENTS WERE ON CAMPUS AND

02:38:33.904 --> 02:38:35.405
APPEARANCE SOME PARENTS WERE

02:38:35.472 --> 02:38:37.441

02:38:37.507 --> 02:38:38.809
TO GET THE PARENTS TO SCHOOLS

02:38:38.876 --> 02:38:41.578
TO GET THEM THEIR FOOD SO. MANY

02:38:41.645 --> 02:38:42.813
DISTRICTS CHANGE THEIR

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:44.615

02:38:52.289 --> 02:38:55.192
TO SEE- PARTICIPATION GROW. I

02:38:55.259 --> 02:38:56.693
KNOW HERE IN OUR DISTRICT WE

02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:57.728

02:38:57.794 --> 02:38:59.963
ANOMALY. WE ACTUALLY SERVED OUR

02:39:00.030 --> 02:39:04.301
TOTAL MEALS THAT WE SERVE ALL

02:39:04.368 --> 02:39:05.535

OVER THE SUMMER. AND SO I AM

02:39:17.214 --> 02:39:18.515
AND THAT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO

02:39:18.582 --> 02:39:19.850

02:45:11.601 --> 02:45:14.170
THE VIRUS. IS THAT AN ISSUE ARE

02:45:14.237 --> 02:45:16.573
PEOPLE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO

02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:17.173
THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY

02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:19.409
NEED. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP

02:45:19.476 --> 02:45:21.311
GET ACCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU

02:45:21.378 --> 02:45:23.280
AND I'M SURE LISA CAN TO THAT-

02:45:23.346 --> 02:45:24.848
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE

02:45:24.914 --> 02:45:26.716
PROBABLY THE MOST CONCERNED

02:45:26.783 --> 02:45:28.485
WITH SAFETY AND ALWAYS HAVE

02:45:28.551 --> 02:45:30.654
BEEN. WE'VE WORN MASKS IN OUR

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:32.722
DEPARTMENT FOR YEARS AND

02:45:32.789 --> 02:45:33.456
BECAUSE WE HAVE A CENTRAL

02:45:33.523 --> 02:45:36.026
FACILITY. AND SO WE HAVE GLOVES

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:39.562
MASKS AND WE PROVIDE. THEM AT

02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:41.364
HAND WIPES AND ALL OF OUR MEALS

02:45:41.431 --> 02:45:42.565
WE'VE GOT HAND WASHING

02:45:42.632 --> 02:45:45.168
STATIONS- SANITIZING STATIONS

02:45:45.235 --> 02:45:46.836
WE HAVE A PROTOCOL ON HAND

02:45:46.903 --> 02:45:49.005
WASHING- AND IF THEY'RE OUT

02:45:49.072 --> 02:45:50.774
DELIVERING THEIR PROVIDED HAND

02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:53.043
WIPES AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN.

02:45:53.109 --> 02:45:55.445
AT LEAST- WHY PAT DOWN THEIR

02:45:55.512 --> 02:45:56.880
HANDS OR SOME OF THEM ARE

02:45:56.946 --> 02:45:58.381
WEARING GLOVES AND JUST. CHANGE

02:45:58.448 --> 02:46:00.684
THE GLOVES WITH EVERY DELIVERY

02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:03.253
AND THEY'RE ALL THEY ALL REMAIN

02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:06.289
SOCIALLY DISTANT WE'VE HAD TO.

02:46:06.356 --> 02:46:08.692
AN HI I'D LIKE TO DESIGN FLOOR

02:46:08.758 --> 02:46:10.727

IF YOU'RE MOVING AROUND- OKAY

02:46:14.831 --> 02:46:15.965
AS LONG AS YOU STAY DISTANT BUT

02:46:16.032 --> 02:46:17.400
IF YOU'RE STANDING IN ONE PLACE

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:18.234
YOU HAVE TO STAND IN CERTAIN

02:46:18.301 --> 02:46:20.270
LOCATIONS. TO ENSURE YOU STAY

02:46:20.337 --> 02:46:22.238

NUMBER OF MINUTES IN THIS ROOM.

02:49:14.644 --> 02:49:17.447
HI I'M HAVING TO THINK ON MY

02:49:17.514 --> 02:49:18.715
FEET TODAY BECAUSE I ACTUALLY

02:49:18.781 --> 02:49:20.416
WANTED TO READ A POEM THAT I

02:49:20.483 --> 02:49:23.386
LOVE. AND THAT FELT MORE

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:25.755
RELEVANT TO ME BUT THEN THIS

02:49:25.822 --> 02:49:32.529
TALK COMES UP ABOUT. THIS

02:49:32.595 --> 02:49:33.029
IMPULSE TO WANT TO FEED

02:49:33.096 --> 02:49:35.365
CHILDREN. AND IT SOUNDS

02:49:35.431 --> 02:49:38.568
AUTHENTIC. BUT THEN I LOOK BACK

02:49:38.635 --> 02:49:41.571
INTO THE HISTORY OF WHAT HAS

02:49:41.638 --> 02:49:43.339
HAPPENED IN THIS LEGISLATURE

02:49:43.406 --> 02:49:45.308
AND HOW THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

02:49:45.375 --> 02:49:48.044
TIED WHAT I SEE AS A BASIC

02:49:48.111 --> 02:49:50.013
HUMAN NEED A BASIC HUMAN

02:49:50.079 --> 02:49:54.951
RIGHTS. TO VACCINE STATUS. CAL

02:49:55.018 --> 02:49:58.454
WORKS CALFRESH WICK. THESE

02:49:58.521 --> 02:50:03.293
THINGS. ARE NOW STANDING IN THE

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:07.564
WAY IN CALIFORNIA. OF CHILDREN

02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:11.134
ACCESSING FOOD. AND SO MY

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:13.202
CONCERN IS THAT THE DIRECTION

02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:16.739
OF THIS LEGISLATURE IS SUCH

02:50:16.806 --> 02:50:22.111
THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE. AND I

02:50:22.178 --> 02:50:23.413
KNOW THIS PROBABLY ISN'T REALLY

02:50:23.479 --> 02:50:25.548
A QUEUE IN A PANEL BUT I SEE

02:50:25.615 --> 02:50:27.850
DOCTOR PAN SITTING UP THERE AND

02:50:27.917 --> 02:50:30.887

REPORT TALKING ABOUT FOOD. I'M

02:50:39.696 --> 02:50:41.531
TALKING ABOUT FOOD BEING

02:50:41.598 --> 02:50:43.266
ACCESSED BY THE CHILDREN OF

02:50:43.333 --> 02:50:46.502
CALIFORNIA. AND THEM HAVING TO

02:50:46.569 --> 02:50:49.339
BE VACCINATED IN ORDER TO BE

02:50:49.405 --> 02:50:52.542
FED. AND I'M FINDING THIS

02:50:52.609 --> 02:50:55.845
CHALLENGING. BECAUSE MY IMPULSE

02:50:55.912 --> 02:50:58.281
WAS TO READ A POEM YESTERDAY

02:50:58.348 --> 02:51:02.485
