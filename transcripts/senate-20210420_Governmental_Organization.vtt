THE MOST. AMONG OTHERS AS IT

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.221
PERTAINS TO THE LOSS OF

BUSINESS DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:41.191

APPROPRIATE WAYS OF DOING IT

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.747

CONFISCATED MATERIALS I KNOW IT

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:16.419
HAPPENS WITH AUTOMOBILES AND-

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:19.155
WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY IS

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:23.092

SUBSTANCE- WHICH IS THE. THE

FIREWORKS IS ACTUALLY BEEN- SET

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.720
BACK INTO THE MARKET SO WE'RE

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.722
SELLING THINGS THAT ARE NOT

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:54.824
AUTHORIZED OUR STATE. TWO OTHER

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:56.025
STATES AND IF THEY'RE NOT

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:58.094
AUTHORIZED IN OUR STATE WHAT

WERE THEY DOING IN OUR STATE TO

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:00.796
BEGIN WITH. AND IF THEY GOT

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:02.498
HERE ILLEGALLY WHAT HOW DO HOW

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.300
CAN WE CONTROL AND I KNOW THIS

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:05.601
BILL DOESN'T HAVE THE REALLY

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.404
ABILITY TO CONTROL. WEATHER

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:09.472
SOMETHING IS BROUGHT INTO OUR

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:11.207
STATE BUT WE'RE BASICALLY

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:13.509
HAVING TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:20.549
WHICH CONTINUES THIS- THIS.

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:23.686
CIRCLE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.221
IT'S JUST BASICALLY INCREASING

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:28.991
THE SUPPLY. OF THESE BANNED

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.459
SUBSTANCES IS A REASON WHY THE

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.861
COMMUTER STATE BECAUSE VERY

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:35.498
LUCRATIVE AND WELL WERE.

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:36.966
SENDING THEM BACK TO THE PEOPLE

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.934
THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:39.969
BRINGING HIM HERE IN THE FIRST

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.003
PLACE AND I JUST DOESN'T MAKE

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:43.339
SENSE TO ME I BELIEVE WE'RE

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:46.776
TALKING ABOUT REDUCING COSTS SO-

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.377
I THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS ABOUT

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:51.314
THE BILL THAT JUST RAISE FLAGS

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:51.881
TO ME I KNOW THAT THERE'S A

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:53.983
PROVISION THAT WILL. THE

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:55.318
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.953
GOING O LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.290
SIXTY FIVE. PERCENT COMING TO

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:03.592
THE STATE WILL BE REDUCED 225%

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.961
SO THE STATE NOW WILL HAVE LESS

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:08.164
MORE BILL- LESS MONEY TO

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.767
ENFORCE BUT IT'LL PASS IT ON TO

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:12.301
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I THINK

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:15.871
THAT'S FAIR. BUT WHEN THE STATE

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:19.375
IS LARGELY. HE- FUNDING THIS

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:24.113
AND SOME OF THOSE- LAWS ARE

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.616

ORGANIZATION AND THAT THAT

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:37.232
PREVIOUS FUND THE LOCAL. THE

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:40.068
FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:41.870

FIREWORKS. THE BASIS IN THEIR

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:49.578
JURISDICTION. SO COULD I JUST

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:50.979
FOLLOW UP AND- THANK YOU MISTER

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:53.048
CHAIRMAN IS THERE REASON THAT

THERE IS. NO NO CAPITAL I MEAN

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:59.021
WHY WHY WAS THE CAP REMOVED IS

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.856
THERE IF THERE IS AN ISSUE OF

01:16:00.923 --> 01:16:02.724
THE COST NEEDING TO BE

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:05.560
INCREASED- I'D I'D CERTAINLY

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:07.229
CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT WOULD

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:09.064
COME FROM BUT THE CAP HAS BEEN

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:10.299
COMPLETELY REMOVED MEANING

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:11.867
THERE'S NO CEILING WHATSOEVER

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.969
AND I WONDER. WHY THE BILL IS

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:14.903
STRUCTURED THAT WAY IF THE

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:17.339
AUTHOR WOULDN'T MIND-

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.741
ADDRESSING THAT. IN ONCE AGAIN

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:22.878
I'M GOING TO DEFER TO- OUR OUR-

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.579
THAT DEBT TRAP AND A DENVER

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:26.915
BILL. BUT AGAIN- I HAD POINTED

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.350
OUT THAT THE FEES WILL BE

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.452
DETERMINED BY THE VOLUME. OF

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.321
THE PRODUCT IN THE NUMBER OF

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:34.456
CONTAINERS THAT ARE IMPORTED.

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.824
SO THAT AND THAT IS THE MAIN

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:39.328
ISSUE BUT- DENISON- TED PLEASE

JUMP IN. BY THE END OF OKAY

01:16:45.567 --> 01:16:48.203
AGAIN IT- THERE CERTAINLY

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.671
THERE'S NO REASON WHY TAP CAN'T

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:53.542
BE PUT ON- THE- TESTING FOR

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:56.378
YOUNG ON THE PRODUCT. IT IS NOW

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.680
IT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IT'S

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.382
FIFTY DOLLARS PER ITEM WHICH

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:03.285
TESTED- WERE IN THE PAST BY

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:06.254
STATUTE STEM- SO YOU CAN SEE ON

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:09.257
WHICH IS INCREASE THE SENSE.

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:10.258
THE LEGISLATURE WAS FIRST

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:16.665

WHOLESALERS- BUT A- THAT IS

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.206
LEFT UP TO THE STATE FARM

MARSHALL SAID THAT. DEPENDING

01:17:27.676 --> 01:17:28.110
ON WHAT THE COST OF THAT

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:35.817
PREMIUM IS- QUESTION. OKAY ANY

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:37.786
OTHER QUESTIONS ANSWERED JONES

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.788
YEAH SO I JUST WANNA VERIFY IF

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:41.423
I HEARD CORRECTLY ON THAT LAST

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.692
STATEMENT THAT THE FEE IS BASED

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.627
ON THE ACTUAL COST OF RECOVERY

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:47.295
SO THERE IS THERE IS A THERE IS

01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:49.798
A NEXUS BETWEEN THE FEE AND THE

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:51.500

01:41:42.863 --> 01:41:43.997

CREATE OUR LIVE MUSIC VENUES OF

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:03.870
COURSE- IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:04.438
SUFFERING OF RESTAURANTS AND

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:06.540
BARS. LIVE MUSIC VENUES ARE

01:44:06.607 --> 01:44:08.241
ABOUT THREE NOTCHES ABOVE THAT

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:09.743
IN TERMS OF SUFFERING- THEY

01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:11.612
COULD THEY SHUT DOWN THE MINUTE

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:13.614

PARTIALLY REOPEN A PERIOD OF

01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:22.556
TIME. LIVE MUSIC VENUES ARE

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:25.058
JUST REALLY AT RISK- THEY'VE

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.059
GOTTEN SOME RELIEF FROM

01:44:26.126 --> 01:44:28.362

01:44:28.428 --> 01:44:29.997
REALLY LET'S TAKE THIS

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:30.530
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:32.833
RECOVER QUICKLY. AND ONE OF THE

01:44:32.899 --> 01:44:34.334
CHALLENGES IS EVEN THOUGH WE

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.302
HAVE ALMOST I THINK AROUND

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:37.838
NINETY- ALCOHOL LICENSE TYPES

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:39.973
IN CALIFORNIA WITH US YOU DON'T

HAVE AN ALCOHOL LICENSE TYPE

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:42.709
SPECIFIC TO LIVE MUSIC VENUES

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:45.178
OF A HAVE TO SHOEHORN. INTO

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:48.148
ANOTHER KIND OF LICENSE AND

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:50.017
THEY FREQUENTLY WILL DO THAT.

01:44:50.083 --> 01:44:51.952
THE BEST PATTERSON CURRENTLY IS

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:53.553
TO GET ON A RUN A FULL

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.422
RESTAURANT LIQUOR LICENSE WHICH

01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:57.758
REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A FULL

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:59.893
KITCHEN- OR YOU KNOW EVEN

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:00.627
THOUGH THEY'RE NOT A

01:45:00.694 --> 01:45:03.163
RESTAURANT- AND SO WHAT THAT

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.364
MEANS ACCOUNTING FOR SO IT'S

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:05.732
VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUILD OUT A

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:08.001
COMPLETE KITCHEN- BUT SECOND IT

01:45:08.068 --> 01:45:09.670
REALLY LIMITS THE KINDS OF

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:17.277
SPACES. BUT A LIVE MUSIC VENUE

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:17.911
CAN GO INTO BECAUSE OF ITS NOT

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.546

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:20.747
RESTAURANT KITCHEN- THEY-

01:45:20.814 --> 01:45:22.049
REALLY CAN GOING LIVE YOU. IS

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:23.617
SUCH AND PART OF OUR CULTURE-

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:25.686
AND- IN OUR CITIES AND THE

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:27.788
DISTANCE ELISE CHRISTODOULIDES

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:29.423

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:31.324
VENUES IT'LL THE FEE WON'T GO

01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:33.427
DOWN- BUT IT'LL JUST CREEK GIVE

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:35.462
THEM. SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY WE

01:45:35.529 --> 01:45:37.297
SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO-

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:42.102
THE OTHER. PIECE OF THIS BILL-

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:47.474
IS IT. HAS TO DO WITH- THE SORT

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:48.575
OF THE CITIZENS OPEN CONTAINER

01:45:48.642 --> 01:45:50.243
LAWS. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:51.912
THAT WE'RE NOT INVENTING THE

01:45:51.978 --> 01:45:54.614
CONCEPT OF OPEN CONTAINERS OWNS

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:55.982
FOR CITIES IF THEY CHOOSE THEY

01:45:56.049 --> 01:45:57.951
CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW. BUT WHAT

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:59.553
IT IS DOING IS CREATING MORE

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:00.854
FLEXIBILITY SO THAT OUR LOCAL

01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:03.123
BARS AND RESTAURANTS. IT OPENED

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:05.392
HIS OWN CONVERTED TO PAID. TO

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.227
BE CLEAR THE CURRENT LAW.

01:46:07.294 --> 01:46:11.364
ALLOWS CITIES TO AUTHORIZE OPEN

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:13.066
CONTAINER SO IF THE CITY HAS A

01:46:13.133 --> 01:46:15.268
STREET FESTIVAL OR A- FESTIVAL

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:16.536
IN THE TOWN SQUARE THEY

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:18.572
DESIGNATE AND AN AREA OF THE

01:46:18.638 --> 01:46:20.140
CITY. AS SOME SORT OF

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:22.075

RIGHT NOW CAN ALLOW OPEN

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:25.712
CONTAINERS AND THAT'S BEEN THE

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:27.881
LAW FOR. FOREVER OR NOT FOREVER

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:32.953
BUT. YOU KNOW GOING BACK

01:46:33.019 --> 01:46:33.587
DECADES AND DECADES. THE WAY IT

01:46:33.653 --> 01:46:34.254

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:45.699
RIGHT THERE IN THE ZONE.

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:46.666

HAVE SOMEONE TAKE OUT OF YOUR

LOCAL COMMUNITY CANNOT. AND SO

01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:03.683
WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS TO

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:05.285
