ABOUT THE NORTH BAY FIRE HOUSE

02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:38.984

WE LOST. DOZENS OF LIVES. IN

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:44.857
EACH OF THE- DEVASTATING FIRES.

02:02:44.924 --> 02:02:46.125
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:47.727
CALIFORNIANS RAN FOR THEIR

02:02:47.793 --> 02:02:49.762
LIVES. AND SOMETIMES IN THE

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:50.963
DARK AT NIGHT WITH JUST THE

02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:52.932
CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK. THEY RAN

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:53.966
FOR THEIR LIVES SCRAMBLING TO

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:55.868
FIND ANY WAY TO ESCAPE THE

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:58.137
ROARING FLAMES. THE WAY WE

02:02:58.204 --> 02:02:59.371
THREE TO STRATEGICALLY GROW OUR

02:02:59.438 --> 02:03:01.273
COMMUNITY SAYS NOW COME INTO

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:03.309
QUESTION IS THE REALITY OF MY

02:03:03.375 --> 02:03:05.377
MEGA FIRES HAVE SAID IN HERE IN

02:03:05.444 --> 02:03:07.847
THE GOLDEN STATE. WE KNOW THAT

02:03:07.913 --> 02:03:09.548
THE SAME DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES

02:03:09.615 --> 02:03:11.283
THAT CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE IN

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:13.919
HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS MUST

02:03:13.986 --> 02:03:16.222
CHANGE. AND IF THEY DON'T JUST

02:03:16.288 --> 02:03:18.758
BEING CANDID ABOUT IT. MORE

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:19.458
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION WILL

02:03:19.525 --> 02:03:21.694
FOLLOW. THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:23.162
GENERAL'S OFFICE IS ALREADY

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:25.397
INTERVENE WITH LAWSUITS ON

02:03:25.464 --> 02:03:26.632
THREE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN

02:03:26.699 --> 02:03:28.100
THE WILD IN URBAN INTERFACE

02:03:28.167 --> 02:03:29.535
BECAUSE OF THEIR WILDFIRE

02:03:29.602 --> 02:03:31.303
IMPACTS. THE NEW NORMAL

02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:33.072
CALIFORNIANS HERE AND THAT'S

02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:35.808
WHY WE NEED SB TWELVE. FIFTY

02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:37.276
TWELVE CENTS A MINIMUM FLOOR

02:03:37.343 --> 02:03:39.078
FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:40.579
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE.

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:42.047
CURRENT STATE STANDARDS ARE

02:03:42.114 --> 02:03:43.816
LIMITED TO THE BUILDING CODE

02:03:43.883 --> 02:03:46.152
REQUIREMENTS FOR LIKE ROADS AND

02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:48.487
SIGNS IN FUEL BREAKS. NOW WHAT

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:49.722
THIS BILL WOULD DO IS TO SET UP

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:51.657
A TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS FOR

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:53.292
THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO

02:03:53.359 --> 02:03:55.694
ESTABLISH A BOLD. NEW STANDARDS

02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:57.897
THAT ENSURE DEVELOPMENTS AS A

02:03:57.963 --> 02:03:59.465
WHOLE ARE DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND

02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:01.734
FIRE NOT JUST THE BUILDINGS

02:04:01.801 --> 02:04:03.836
WITH IN THOSE DEVELOPMENTS.

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:04.770
SOME OF THESE NEW STANDARDS

02:04:04.837 --> 02:04:06.572
WOULD INCLUDE A WILDLAND FIRE

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:08.507
HAZARD ASSESSMENT IN WILDFIRE

02:04:08.574 --> 02:04:10.242
HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN THAT

02:04:10.309 --> 02:04:11.844
STANDARDS FOR THE ORGANIZATION

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:13.712
AND DEPLOYMENT OF. FIRE

02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:15.848
SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS AT THE

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:17.783
DEVELOPMENT LOCATION AND

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:19.118
CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE

02:04:19.185 --> 02:04:21.187
TO REDUCE IGNITION POTENTIAL

02:04:21.253 --> 02:04:23.189
AND ENSURE AVAILABILITY WATER

02:04:23.255 --> 02:04:25.457
SUPPLIES ESSENTIAL FOR FIRE

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:30.663
SUPPRESSION DURING A WILDFIRE.

02:04:30.729 --> 02:04:31.263
HE COULDN'T YOU CAN NO LONGER

02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:32.665
HAVE. ONE WAY ENDING ONE YEAH

02:04:32.731 --> 02:04:34.900
YOU'D HAVE TO. MULTIPLE IN AND

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:35.868
DEFENSIBLE SPACE WOULD BE

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:38.571
REQUIRED. MANAGEMENT AND FUEL

02:04:38.637 --> 02:04:40.472
MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND

02:04:40.539 --> 02:04:41.340
THEN THERE WOULD BE AN

02:04:41.407 --> 02:04:43.409
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED

02:04:43.475 --> 02:04:45.044
AND IT WOULD ALL BE FUNDED IN

02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:46.979
AND OUT AND IMPLEMENTED TO

02:04:47.046 --> 02:04:48.814
VERIFY ON GOING COMPLIANCE.

02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:50.983
BACK BY FINANCING MECHANISMS

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:53.853
LIKE ASSESSMENTS ON H. AWAY

02:04:53.919 --> 02:04:54.453
FUNDS THAT ARE A CONDITION ON

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.455
THE DEVELOPMENT. WE WOULD LOOK

02:04:56.522 --> 02:04:57.590
TO SITE SPECIFIC SAFETY

02:04:57.656 --> 02:04:59.091
MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:00.292
DEVELOPMENT OF THE WHOLE IS

02:05:00.359 --> 02:05:02.261
PLANNING CONSTRUCTED TO REDUCE

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:03.996
THEIR ENCROACHMENT OF

02:05:04.063 --> 02:05:05.965
UNCONTROLLED FIRE IN. A

02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:07.333
DEVELOPMENT LAY OUT THAT

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:09.168
REDUCES WILDFIRE RISK TO THE

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:11.670
GREATEST EXTENT PART PRACTICAL.

02:05:11.737 --> 02:05:13.172
BUT BLUNTLY PUT THIS

02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:14.974
LEGISLATION SAYS THAT IF

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:15.774
DEVELOPMENTS CAN'T MEET THE

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:19.912
STANDARDS. THE LOCALS CANNOT

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:21.580
APPROVE THEM. NOW THE STANDARD

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:23.082
ARE KEY SAID THE STANDARDS GET

02:05:23.148 --> 02:05:24.650
INCREASE IN STRONG. AS

02:05:24.717 --> 02:05:26.552
DEVELOPMENTS GET LARGER THE

02:05:26.619 --> 02:05:28.387
REASON IS THIS. LARGER

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:30.522
DEVELOPMENTS PUT MORE PEOPLE IN

02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:32.124
THE MOVIE WHILE THE URBAN

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:34.927
INTERFACE. ASSEMBLY MUST MEET

02:05:34.994 --> 02:05:35.928
HIGHER STANDARDS IN SMALLER

02:05:35.995 --> 02:05:38.130
DEVELOPMENTS. THIS MEANS THAT

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:39.765
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE STRINGENT.

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:42.167
BUT ARE NOT TOO COSTLY AS THE

02:05:42.234 --> 02:05:43.736
TOTALLY PREVENT DEVELOPMENT.

02:05:43.802 --> 02:05:46.138
EITHER COMMONSENSE AND BY THE

02:05:46.205 --> 02:05:46.839
WAY WE SHOULD PROBABLY BEEN

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:48.707
DONG THIS DECADES AGO LET'S

02:05:48.774 --> 02:05:51.410
JUST BE BLUNT. AND WE KNOW THAT

02:05:51.477 --> 02:05:53.412
HALF OF THE BUILDINGS LOST HALF

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:54.980
OF THE BUILDINGS LOST IN THE

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:58.417
LAST DECADE WERE BUILT IN THE

02:05:58.484 --> 02:05:59.718
WILL WE- BILL UNDER CURRENT

02:05:59.785 --> 02:06:01.186
CODE. THAT SUPPOSED TO

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:04.290
WITHSTAND. THESE FIRES THIS

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:07.059
WILL ALSO ENHANCES THE PLANNING

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:07.893
BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST DO

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.495
INCLUDING TO COME UP WITH A%

02:06:09.561 --> 02:06:11.397
STRATEGY TO RETROFIT EXISTING

02:06:11.463 --> 02:06:13.232
BUILDINGS. YEAH YOU MAY HEAR

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:15.334
FROM OPPONENTS TODAY BUT THIS

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:17.269
BILL WOULD MAYBE LOOK LABELED

02:06:17.336 --> 02:06:18.871
AS A HOUSING KILLER. WILL HEAR

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:20.906
THE FACTS OF THIS THIS BILL IS

02:06:20.973 --> 02:06:22.608
ALMOST IDENTICAL ALMOST

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:24.710
IDENTICAL TO A BILL THAT WAS

02:06:24.777 --> 02:06:26.178
APPROVED BY BIPARTISAN

02:06:26.245 --> 02:06:28.714
MAJORITIES IN BOTH HOUSES AND

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:30.249
SENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK

02:06:30.316 --> 02:06:32.484
LAST YEAR. WE MADE AMENDMENTS

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:33.285
TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S

02:06:33.352 --> 02:06:35.254
CONCERNS. EVERYONE OF THE

02:06:35.321 --> 02:06:38.524
PROPONENTS ON THIS BILL THIS

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.025
YEAR. EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE

02:06:40.092 --> 02:06:41.327
NEUTRAL ON THE LEGISLATION LAST

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:45.764
YEAR. AND THEIR CONCERNS THIS

02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:47.266
YEAR OUR WITH PROVISIONS OF

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:49.034
THIS BILL BETTER THE SAME

02:06:49.101 --> 02:06:52.237
PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE

IT'S GOING TO ON THE- AND

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:38.136
LESSEN THE ONE FIRE. AREAS

02:24:38.202 --> 02:24:39.370
BECAUSE WE TO VIEW THIS CON.

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:40.405

ENDING NEW HOUSING IN HIGH RISK

02:24:44.909 --> 02:24:47.812
WILD FIRE AREAS WITHOUT DOING

02:24:47.879 --> 02:24:50.782
ANYTHING. TO PROMOTE. HOUSING

02:24:50.848 --> 02:24:52.850
AND NON WILD FIRE AREAS AND WE

02:24:52.917 --> 02:24:54.685
AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR.

02:24:54.752 --> 02:24:57.155
IT IS NOT RANDOM THAT WE HAVE

02:24:57.221 --> 02:25:00.224
SO MUCH HOUSING BEING BUILT. IN

02:25:00.291 --> 02:25:02.794
OUR HIGH RISK WILD FIRE AREAS.

02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:04.128
IT'S BECAUSE WE MAKE IT

02:25:04.195 --> 02:25:06.330
DIFFICULT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO

02:25:06.397 --> 02:25:08.466
BUILD MUCH HOUSING. IN OTHER

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:10.935
AREAS LIKE IN THE BULK OF THE

02:25:11.002 --> 02:25:12.937
BAY AREA OR PARTS OF L. LIKE WE

02:25:13.004 --> 02:25:14.005
HAVE THROUGH ZONING AND

02:25:14.072 --> 02:25:15.373
OTHERWISE WE MADE IT SO

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:17.442
DIFFICULT. TO BUILD INFILL

02:25:17.508 --> 02:25:20.278
HOUSING ROOM POWERED NIMBYS TO

02:25:20.344 --> 02:25:23.181
SHUT DOWN THE LAY EMPTY HOUSING

02:25:23.247 --> 02:25:25.416
AND SO IT SPRAWLS OUT. ABOUT

02:25:25.483 --> 02:25:27.819
TWICE SO MUCH GETS BUILT. IN

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:32.623
THE WE SO WE HAVE TO DO. WE

02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:34.058
HAVE TO DO BOTH. TIMES I DO

02:25:34.125 --> 02:25:36.427
WANT TO SPECIFICALLY THE V. THE

02:25:36.494 --> 02:25:37.929
OPR PRINT WAS THE PREVIOUS

02:25:37.995 --> 02:25:40.098
VERSION THAT I SUPPORTED THAT

02:25:40.164 --> 02:25:41.833
WE ALL SUPPORTED IRAQ MOST OF

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:44.001
US SUPPORTED. I BELIEVE BUT I

02:25:44.068 --> 02:25:45.436
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

02:25:45.503 --> 02:25:47.505
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WERE SORT OF

02:25:47.572 --> 02:25:49.006
GIVING A PROXY OPR BY

02:25:49.073 --> 02:25:51.509
REFERENCING AND THEY'RE AN OPR.

02:25:51.576 --> 02:25:53.211
HAS ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE SINCE

02:25:53.277 --> 02:25:56.314
THE VETO OF SB ONE EIGHTY TWO.

02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:58.282
THAT IS AYE UNDERSTAND THAT-

02:25:58.349 --> 02:26:01.886
GOES BEYOND- VERY HIGH WILDFIRE

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:04.088
RISK AREAS THAT INCLUDE HIGH

02:26:04.155 --> 02:26:06.357
RISK WHICH IS A HUGE SWATH OF

02:26:06.424 --> 02:26:10.094
CALIFORNIA- AND SO THAT IS

02:26:10.161 --> 02:26:12.230
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:14.632
TO TAKE A LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE

02:26:14.699 --> 02:26:17.535
THAT WE ARE NOT. ON SWEEPING IN

02:26:17.602 --> 02:26:20.171

DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY HOUSING

02:26:24.075 --> 02:26:25.543

VICE CHAIR OF GOVERNANCE AND

02:31:41.158 --> 02:31:42.460
FINANCE. AND I JUST WANNA JUST

02:31:42.526 --> 02:31:44.562
ON SOME. WERE LIVING IN A

02:31:44.628 --> 02:31:46.564
BUBBLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:47.631
EVERYTHING TODAY'S INCOMING

02:31:47.698 --> 02:31:49.233
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO START.

02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:51.368
LOOKING AT NOT BUILDING IN HIGH

02:31:51.435 --> 02:31:53.270
FIRE RISK AREAS WITH THEM IN A

02:31:53.337 --> 02:31:55.940
BUBBLE. EDITORIAL BOARDS ARE

02:31:56.006 --> 02:31:58.843
ALREADY OPINIE ACROSS THE STATE

02:31:58.909 --> 02:31:59.443
THAT WE NEED TO START TEARS A

02:31:59.510 --> 02:32:02.146
CONSIDERING. AT THIS BILL WOULD

02:32:02.213 --> 02:32:04.415
HAVE GOTTEN REALLY CLOSE LAST

02:32:04.482 --> 02:32:08.052
YEAR TO BE ABLE TO BAN- THROUGH

02:32:08.118 --> 02:32:11.856
POLICY. NEW HOUSING IN HIGH

02:32:11.922 --> 02:32:14.124
FIRE RISK ZONES. I UNDERSTAND

02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:15.993
THE MINISTRATION DID NOT WANT

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:18.729
TO MESS UP THE NEXT RINA CYCLE-

02:32:18.796 --> 02:32:20.231
AND THAT IS A CONCERN BY THE

02:32:20.297 --> 02:32:21.866
WAY THAT THE CHAIR OF HOUSING%

02:32:21.932 --> 02:32:23.534
BROUGHT FORWARD AS WELL I WANT

02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:24.602
TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOU

02:32:24.668 --> 02:32:27.505
THAT. IN THIS BILL ZITO. THAT

02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:31.075
LANGUAGE IS NOW OUT. SO WHAT WE

02:32:31.141 --> 02:32:33.444
NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO CHANGE

02:32:33.511 --> 02:32:33.978
WITH THE TIMES THAT WE'RE

02:32:34.044 --> 02:32:36.547
LIVING IN. REGARDLESS OF THE

02:32:36.614 --> 02:32:38.616
BUILDING CODE THAT WE HAVE NOW.

02:32:38.682 --> 02:32:41.218
LET'S GO BACK TO THE FACTS.

02:32:41.285 --> 02:32:43.287
HALF OF THE HOMES THAT WE'VE

02:32:43.354 --> 02:32:45.556
LOST IN THE LAST DECADE DELYLAH

02:32:45.623 --> 02:32:48.559
FIRE IN THE WORLD. FIVE THE

02:32:48.626 --> 02:32:50.828
REALITY IS THAT STATE LAW OR

02:32:50.895 --> 02:32:52.963
ORDER REQUIRES. CITY

02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:55.566
GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER THE OPI

02:32:55.633 --> 02:32:59.837
OPR TECHNICAL ADVISORY- ITEMS

02:32:59.904 --> 02:33:00.905
WHEN THEY UPDATE THEIR JOURNAL

02:33:00.971 --> 02:33:04.141
PLANS FOR FIRE HAZARDS. IN ITS

02:33:04.208 --> 02:33:06.277
NOT NEW BY THE WAY. THE OTHER

02:33:06.343 --> 02:33:09.146
ISSUE IS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

02:33:09.213 --> 02:33:10.447
BANNING DEVELOPMENT IN THE

02:33:10.514 --> 02:33:12.683
WORLD IT'S NOT IT CREATES A

02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:14.952
PATH TO DEVELOP FAITHFULLY IN

02:33:15.019 --> 02:33:16.921
EVERY JURISDICTION IN THE

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:19.590
STANDARDS ARE CRITICAL FOR

02:33:19.657 --> 02:33:22.526
THAT- THE OTHER PIECE I THINK

02:33:22.593 --> 02:33:23.928
IT'S WORTH REPEATING THESE-

02:33:23.994 --> 02:33:25.663
PIERCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

02:33:25.729 --> 02:33:26.630
TECHNICAL ADVISORY WHICH WAS

02:33:26.697 --> 02:33:28.399
THE ADVISORY IN PLACE LAST

02:33:28.465 --> 02:33:30.167
YEAR. SAID THIS I WANT TO

02:33:30.234 --> 02:33:32.369
QUOTE. THE FOLLOWING NUMBER ARE

02:33:32.436 --> 02:33:34.171
EXAMPLES OF POLICIES AT A LOCAL

02:33:34.238 --> 02:33:35.973
GOVERNMENT MY DOC TO MITIGATE

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:37.541
DAMAGE TO VALUES AND ASSETS

02:33:37.608 --> 02:33:39.543
RELATED WILDFIRE AVOID WERE

02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:40.945
FEASIBLE APPROVING NEW

02:33:41.011 --> 02:33:42.780

02:33:42.846 --> 02:33:44.848
OFFER RISK IF OF WOULDN'T IT IS

02:33:44.915 --> 02:33:46.884
NOT FEASIBLE CONDITION SUCH AS

02:33:46.951 --> 02:33:48.052
NEW DEVELOPMENT ON OR

02:33:48.118 --> 02:33:50.688
IMPLEMENTATION. OF MEASURES TO

02:33:50.754 --> 02:33:54.692
REDUCE RISKS WITH THAT

02:33:54.758 --> 02:33:55.159
DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE

02:33:55.225 --> 02:33:56.527
IMPLEMENTED YEAH. WE CAN DEBATE

02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:58.228
THE NEW LANGUAGE BUT THE BOTTOM

02:33:58.295 --> 02:33:59.830
LINE IS THAT THIS BILL SAYS THE

02:33:59.897 --> 02:34:02.700
STANDARDS MUST BE FEASIBLE AND

02:34:02.766 --> 02:34:04.068
THAT'S WHAT REALLY THIS IS ALL

02:34:04.134 --> 02:34:06.303
ABOUT. THERE'S NO WAY TO BE

02:34:06.370 --> 02:34:08.339
ABLE TO GET AROUND THAT. AND

02:34:08.405 --> 02:34:10.941
AGAIN THIS BILL IS STRICTLY

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:12.810
LIMITED IT'S STRICTLY LIMITED

02:34:12.876 --> 02:34:14.979
TO VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:17.114
SEVERITY ZONES IT DOES NOT

02:34:17.181 --> 02:34:18.849

BECAUSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE.

02:34:23.487 --> 02:34:25.022
THAT IS CLEAR THE LAST THING ON

02:34:25.089 --> 02:34:28.926
PHASES. IT'S AT THE MINIMUM FOR

02:34:28.993 --> 02:34:29.660
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WEEKS. AND

02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:32.296

02:34:37.201 --> 02:34:38.802
CODE. THIS BILL IS ALMOST

02:34:38.869 --> 02:34:40.204
IDENTICAL TO A BILL THAT WAS

02:34:40.270 --> 02:34:41.939
APPROVED WITH BIPARTISAN

SINCE EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO AND IT

02:36:58.208 --> 02:36:59.576

THIS. WE KNOW THAT THIS

02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:55.566
APPROACH WORKS BECAUSE THE IRS
