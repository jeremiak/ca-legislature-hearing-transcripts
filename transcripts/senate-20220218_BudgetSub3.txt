BRANDON THANK YOU- AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- SO AT A HIGH LEVEL OUR DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET- ARE REVISED TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET IS SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION WITH THREE POINT THREE BILLION COMING FROM GENERAL FUND. AND THEN OUR PROPOSED TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET IS FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION WITH ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THE REASON FOR THAT SLIGHT DECLINE IN- FROM TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- AS YOU ALL. ARE AWARE THE EARLY ACTION THAT WAS PROPOSED LAST. WEEK AND PASSED INCLUDED SOME OF OUR COVERED RELATED- COSTS FOR SUPPORT THROUGH THIS CURRENT YEAR. DOES DROP OFF INTO THE BUDGET YEAR AND SOME OF THOSE COSTS TO CONTINUE BUT AT A LESSER AMOUNTS- SO I WON'T GET INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THE COVERT RELATED COSTS FOR THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S INCLUDED BECAUSE WE WILL BE GETTING INSTALLED SINCE THE NEXT TWO AGENDA ITEMS. BUT THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER AREAS THAT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FOR US- THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- IN OUR CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. WE'VE BEEN MAKING A LOT OF INVESTMENTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN THE BUDGETS RELATED TO ALZHEIMER'S RELATED PROGRAMS. THIS BUDGET CONTINUES THOSE INVESTMENTS WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME RELATED TO THE ALZHEIMER'S HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE. AND THEN IN THE CENTER THERE'S ALSO. A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME. EIGHT SETTLEMENT FUND. A PROBE. AND THAT'S GOING TO GO SOME OTHER AWARENESS. TARGETED TOWARDS YOUTH- EDUCATION AWARENESS AND BEND ALL RISK- EDUCATION AND THERE'S ALSO FIVE MILLION FROM THIS FUND. TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA ON OPIOID. OVERDOSE TRENDS- WE ALSO THIS YEAR IN OUR BUDGET HAS SOME CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENTS. THERE'S A ONE TIME INCREASE OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM. AND THAT'S GOING TO GO TO FIND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND TRIBES TO DEVELOP REGIONAL CLIMATE. AND HEALTH RESILIENCE PLANS. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO TEN MILLION GENERAL ONE TO INITIATE A CLIMATE HEALTH SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. AND THIS IS GOING TO HELP PROVIDE NEAR REAL TIME NOTIFICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. AND THE COMMUNITY ON EMERGING OR INTENSIFIED CLIMATE SENSITIVE DISEASES. AND THEN THE FINAL AREA HIGHLIGHT IS RELATED TO SOME OF OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD INVESTMENTS. YOU ALSO MAY RECALL SOME INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING OVER THE YEARS ARE BLACK AND HEALTH PROGRAM IN OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAMS THIS BUDGET CONTINUES AS INVESTMENTS WITH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR. THOSE BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS- AND THAT INVESTMENT WILL HELP SERVE APPROXIMATELY SIX THOUSAND ADDITIONAL FAMILIES FOR OVER FIVE YEARS ON TOP OF THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING- SERVED IN OUR OWN VISITING PROGRAMS. AND ROUGHLY SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS IN A BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S TEN MILLION GENERAL FUND INCLUDED TO EXPAND EARLY LITERACY EFFORTS. BY PROVIDING MULTILINGUAL BOOKS TO YOUNG CHILDREN AND EARLY LITERACY PROGRAMMING FOR FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. TODAY I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF CONVERSATION RELATED TO OUR CALL OF THE COST IN FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH BUT WANTED TO ELEVATE SOME OF THOSE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE. AND AS YOU MENTIONED BIG AGENDA TODAY AND WE HAVE OUR WHOLE TEAM I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE ITEMS THAT I TALKED ABOUT BUT- IN THE MEANTIME ALL PASS IT BACK TO THE DOCTOR OR GOING TO CONTINUE OUR PRESENTATION. THANKS. THANK YOU BRANDON. THE MISSION OF THE H. IS TOO VASTLY AND WELL BEING CAL. THAT PEOPLES AND CAN. HEALTH NOT JUST THE- OF DISEASE OR INJURY HOW IS OF COMPLETE FIRST MENTAL SOCIAL WELL BEING. HEALTH MAKES EVERY POP. AND I EIGHTY EIGHT THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE DEFINED HEALTH IS WHAT. AS A TO COLLECTIVELY TO ENSURE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN BE HEALTHY. WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION'S THAT THE ROLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LIVE LEARN WORK AND PLAY. IN SPITE OF THESE DEFINITIONS PUBLIC HEALTH IS LARGELY INVISIBLE MANY STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND PUBLIC HEATH. OR CALL HAS FOUR PILLARS THAT THIS APPROACH THE FIRST PILLAR IS ECOLOGICAL SOCIAL. THAT IS HOW PEOPLE ARE WITH THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR SOCIAL NETWORKS AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH ANY OF THE ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU FOR EXAMPLE THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN CLIMATE CHANGE- NUMBER TWO LIFE CORE. AN INTER. PROCESS THESE FRANK ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND TOXIC STRESS IMPACTING THE NEURAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN AND IMPACTING LIFE. THEIR HEALTH FOR LIFE. INTERGENIC THANK ALSO INTER GENERAL INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF THE SOCIAL AND BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ADVERSITY COLOR NUMBER THREE EQUITY AT HEALTHEQUITY THANK OF THE LOW INCOME AND RURAL RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND THE SOCIAL WORKERS THAT WERE IMPACTED BY CODE NINETEEN. ALSO RACIAL ETHNIC HEALTH INEQUITIES THAT PREDISPOSE PERSON SO HAVING COVERED COMPLICATIONS COLOR NUMBER FOUR IS PREVENTION ESPECIALLY PRIMARY PREVENTION THANKS FOR EXAMPLE. VACCINE SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS THAT COMFORT- AND UNITY SO THAT WE PREVENT MANY CHILDHOOD VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASES. AND OF COURSE MASS FIRST SOURCE CONTROL AND RESPIRATORY PROTECTION AGAINST COVERED. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION HAS CONTRIBUTED TO REDUCING THE OVERALL DEATH RATE FOR ALL GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER TODAY CALIFORNIA FACES INCREASING PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES WHICH IMPACT OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND AMPLIFY SOCIAL INEQUITIES THESE CHALLENGES ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE IN SCALE SCOPE AND SEVERITY. OUR POPULATION IS GROWING AS WELL AS AG WE SEE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING DROUGHT WILDFIRES HEAT WAVES AND CORE ERROR QUALITY. ECONOMIC AND SOCIALIST PARTIES INTENSIFY STRESS AND ANXIETY WE ALSO OBSERVED ESCALATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONCERNS INCLUDING ISOLATION TRAUMA AND ADDICTION. THE COVER DATING DEREK IS AMONG VISIBLE EXAMPLE OF ECOLOGICAL SOCIAL FORCES IMPACTING HEALTH WITH PROFOUND AND DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES ON THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. BEGINNING AT TWENTY TWENTY THERE WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN ALL FIVE DEATHS FOR ALL RACIAL OR RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE ALL CAUSE MORTALITY IN CALIFORNIA INCREASED. WHAT IS THE INCREASE IN TERMS OF ACCESS THAT BY FIFTH WAS THIRTY FOUR POINT 1% CHANGE IN THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY- REDUCING THAT BY THREE POINT SIX YEARS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC DEATH RATES HAVE CONTINUED TO GO UP AND THE DISPARITIES IN THE GROUPS ARE WIDENING. A PANDEMIC REVEALED AND WORSENED UNDERLINE INEQUITIES EXIST EXISTING INEQUITIES AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CREATE HIGHER RISK FOR POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. WHICH WERE MADE EVEN MORE VISIBLE DURING THE PANDEMIC. SOCIAL ECONOMIC FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO GREATER EXPOSURE AND HIGHER RATES OF SEVERE OUTCOMES SUCH AS HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS FROM BECAUSE IN NINETEEN. EXAMPLES INCLUDE LIVING IN CROWDED HOUSING RELIANCE ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WORKING IN FRONT LINE ESSENTIAL SERVICE SECTORS HIGHER RATES OF COAL COAL MORBIDITIES WORK FOR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. THE INCREASE DOES RATES DUE TO COVER NINETEEN WILL LEAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON FUTURE GENERATIONSAND THE POPULATION. HEALTH LANDSCAPE IN CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER SUCH AS A GRANDPARENT PARENT SPOUSE SIBLING OR CHILD. MANY CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS OF A PARENT OR CARE GIVER WHO PROVIDED THE CHILD'S HOME AND BASIC NEEDS INCLUDING LOVE SECURITY AND DAILY CARE. EFFECTS OF THE LOSSES INCLUDE CREATING TRAUMA LONG LASTING HEALTH AND FINANCIAL HARDSHIP MENTAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES AS WELL AS RELATED PHYSICAL HEALTH RISK. LOSS OF A FAMILY MEMBER CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. HM COVER NINETY- INITIALLY COVERED NINE THERE NO OTHER MARTEL TRENDS AND OTHER IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. ASKING THE COURT TO SEIZE COVER NINETEEN AT ALZHEIMER DISEASE WHERE THE TOP THREE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH. IF GIVING CARDS WHICH DECREASE AND- FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY STARTED GOING UP. ALZHEIMER'S ALZHEIMER'S DEATHS AT THE SINGLE LARGEST INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM 1-920-192-2020 AND MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE TWO THOUSAND. IF CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUE IT IS ON TRACK TO BECOME THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN CALIFORNIA. HEBER HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE GROWING AREA OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE INCREASES WERE OBSERVED FOR DRUG OVERDOSE ROAD INJURY HOMICIDE AND ALCOHOL RELATED CONDITIONS. PRIMARILY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS THERE WAS A 50% INCREASE IN DRUG OVERDOSE AT A 30% INCREASE IN HOMICDE DEATHS DRUG OVERDOSE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF YEARS OF LIFE LOST IN TWENTY TWENTY- DISORDERS AND SCHIZOPHRENIA ARE AMONG THE TOP CAUSE OF HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR YOUTH AND MIDDLE AGE ADULTS. AND THERE ARE OTHER CONTINUING DISPARITIES IN AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT I WON'T HAVE TIME TO GO OVER TODAY. THERE ARE THERE ARE ALSO MANY ADDITIONAL FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INFLUENCING POPULATION HEALTH SOCIAL ICE ISOLATION AND DISCONNECTION. YOU THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FACE SCHOOL CLOSURES IN CAPS AND LEARNING AND THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN ADULT INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE OPIOID USE DISORDER ADULT ADULT DEPRESSION. WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY CDPH HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES TO SHAPE AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY CAN ADDRESS THE FULL RANGE OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE A PERSON'S OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. NEW AND EXISTING POPULATION HEALTH CONCERNS HAVE HEIGHTENED THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN A MODERNIZED PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM THIS INVESTMENT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY BUILD BACK BETTER BUT TO BUILD BACK MORE EQUITABLY. SUNDAY MENTALLY RE ARCHITECTING THE FOUNDATIONS AND STRUCTURES THAT SUPPORT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ANYTHING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO. BUT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. OKAY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I KNOW THAT DELVE MORE DEEPLY INTO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE PRESENTED DURING OUR HEARING TODAY I DID HAVE A FEW. BROADER QUESTIONS AS PARTY OVERVIEW SO FIRST I WOULD MAKE NOTES- THAT LEESON ARE RIGHT UP THAT HOPEFULLY PEOPLE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE. ON THE FUNDING FOR. THE GENERAL FUND FOR DEPART PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH STARTS WITH THE ACTUAL TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. COURSE GOING TO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE PROPOSED. HOW LOW WILL THE GENERAL FUND. HAS BEEN NINETEEN TWENTIES I GUESS WHEN- THAT THE ONE CODE STARTED AND- IF WE HAD ONLY VERY THIN LINE THE BOTTOM WE ONLY DOUBLED ITS LET'S SAY WHICH WE WOULDN'T BARELY NOTICE ON THE GRASS. IN THOSE PRIOR YEARS PERHAPS- SOMETHING METALLIC AND EVEN PERHAPS IN SOME OF THE SPENDING THAT WE CAN DO NOW WOULD NOT BE QUITE AS HIGH- SO I'D SO IT'S WE ASSIST PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT- WE'RE WE'RE COMING IN THE FUTURE- AND I APPRECIATE IT WON'T RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT LATER THE- GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT WHICH IS PUT INTO THIS- THIS THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION- SO I'M GOING IN SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE A- TRULY AN ON GOING INVESTMENT. IN. PUBLIC HEALTH- SO I GUESS ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS. WITH WITH THE RIGHT IN BY NOW THAT MOST OF THE MONEY THE PART ABOUT HOW THEY'LL BE IN THE PAST COME FROM FEDERAL FIVE. AND FUN WHICH TEND BE RESTRICTED SO FORTH. IN RESPONSE TO COAL BED. AND THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE OF BOTH FUNNY AND WORKFOR DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AT THIS PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC CAN YOU SPEAK TO. THE WORK FORCE AT CDPH SO- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR A LOT MORE POSITIONS WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING ABOUT. BUT GIVEN THE CURRENT WORK FORCE- HOW ARE WE DOING IN TERMS OF VACANCIES. ARE WE YES GIVEN THE CRISIS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING VERY IMPORTANT WORK IN MANY OTHER FIELDS I THINK IT'S JUST RELAYED BY THE DIRECTOR. IT IS A LOT YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING OUT THERE- AND WE AND USUALLY DURING PANDEMICS ARE OTHER OUTBREAKS AND SO FORTH OFTENTIMES YOU HAVE TO PULL STAFF FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER IN ORDER TO. TAKE CARE OF A CRISIS BUT THEN THAT MEANS WORK SLOWED OR STOPPED. IN OTHER AREAS. SO CAN YOU JUST THAT IS PART OF THE OVERVIEW. I GIVE ME A GENERAL IDEA ABOUT THE OVERALL CD P. H. WORK FORCE IS IT ARE THEY ABLE TO. DO THAT THE- DO THE NON THING ARE SUPPOSED TO DO HOW WE DOING IN TERMS OF BACON AND HIRING AND TURNOVER. THE OVERALL. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'LL GIVE A COUPLE COMMENTS THAT ASKS THAT STUDENTS CORRECT- YOU KNOW SINCE EVERYBODY. FIRST YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY IN PUBLIC HEALTH ALMOST EVERYBODY PUBLIC HEALTH. HAS HAD SOME IMPACT SOME WORK RELATED TO COME IN NINETEEN DISTRICTS SINCE JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND IT DID TAKE AWAY FROM OTHER OTHER AREAS WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE JUST WITH A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS THAT THAT HAVE DOES IT REALLY HAVE TO HAVE SKYROCKETED. WE KNOW THAT HIV TRANSMISSION CONTINUES TO HAPPEN WE NOTE TUBERCULOSIS CONTINUES TO BE TRANSMITTED. THERE ARE A LOT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVE THE ATTENTION. WE BEEN. VERY VERY SAND- AND IT PARKING REALIZE. IS THAT- IT HAS GIVEN US A LOT BECAUSE SOME OF THE FOR TO. SOME OF OUR SOME OF SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE- I. T. BUT THE WORK FOR IS MOST AND- AND YOU KNOW WE WILL WE GET TO THE- AND I DON'T WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE THAT WOULD BE CAN DO FOR FILLING THOSE GAPS ARE IN IMPORTANT SH ME ASK THIS IS AN ISSUE SHE'S. CLOSER TO THE OPERATION DETAILS AND SHE CAN. ARE SOME ARE MAKING SEE RIGHT RIGHT NOW IS TIME TO ABOUT 8% WHICH IS IF WE CAN WITH WE- RUN AND- ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE SOME TO RECRUIT CUSTOMER. LIKE LIBERTY ENDS THAT WE CAN TO. DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO FILL I THINK ALSO BEEN ABLE TO USE SOME OF THE ONE TIME DOLLARS AND THROUGH A VARIETY OF. RECRUITMENT EFFORTS BEEN ABLE TO HIRE ABOUT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED NEW PEOPLE AND LAST PROBABLY. MONTH BETTER FOR COVERT RESPONSE THAT WE ARE GRADUALLY RETURNING SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN REDIRECTED BUT CLEARLY WE'RE STILL IN RESPONSE AND STILL NEED TO KEEP SOME OF THE FOLKS RE DIRECTED SO WE ARE ABLE TO GET EVERYTHING DONE. AT ALL I MEAN THERE ARE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE WORKLOAD AND WE'LL BE TRANSFERRING TO TRANSITION THAT BACK BUT WE WILL I THINK AS WE GET INTO THE WORK FORCE DISCUSSION WITH THE NEW DOLLARS. WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS CREATIVE AS POSSIBLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S WORKED THROUGH THE CULVERT RESPONSES SETTING UP TEAMS TO HELP US RECRUIT FOR NEW POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE. H. OUR DEDICATED STAFF WE HAVE A PROGRAM DEDICATED STAFF AND THEN WE HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE WHO JUST KNOW HOW TO GET ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND THINGS PROCESSED AND CAN HELP WITH RECRUITMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENTS CAN HELP WITH ALL THE PAPERWORK THAT HAS TO GO TO HR TO FILL POSITIONS AND SO. THAT HAS BEEN A REALLY SUCCESSFUL MODEL FOR US IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO. AND IT REALLY EXPEDITE SOME OF THE HIRING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING ON THE OPEN POSITIONS BUT THEN WE WILL ALSO USE A SIMILAR PROCESS AS WE GET. TO YOU BRING ON WORKFORCE AND UNDER THESE NEW DOLLARS AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN. REALLY GOOD GREAT AND THAT. THEY BUILT ON THE RELAY. AND THE SCALE THEY BILL IN THE CONGRESS THAT RESPONSE INTO SOMEONE KEY AREA WHERE WE PLAN TO REACH. SO WE HOPING WE CAN MIX OF THOSE PEOPLE. PERMANENT STATE POSITIONS AND THEREBY GAIN FROM ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE THAT THEY BROUGHT TO THE TABLE. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER. QUESTION RELATED AGAIN OVERALL WORK FORCE IS THAT- YEAH THAT POINTED OUT. IN THE PAST AT LEAST MOST OF THE MONEY FOR C. PEACHES COME THROUGH. ESSENTIALLY GRANTS AND THINGS ARE FAIRLY DIRECTED FUNDS I MEAN IF WE SEE THE BOXES AS FEDERAL FUNDS BUT A LOT OF IT IS FOR VERY SPECIFIC THINGS- AND THAT. SO I GUESS. THE QUESTION IS THAT. THE WORK. THESE GRANTS FOR. OTHER TYPES OF FUNDS THAT YOU GET- AND HOPEFULLY AT THE FUNDERS DO UNDERSTAND WITH CODE THAT YOU HAD TO YOU KNOW THERE THERE NEED TO BE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN TIME IT'S- HOW ARE YOU ABLE. HOW YOU DOING IN TERMS OF KEEPING UP WITH THE OTHER WORK HAS BEEN UNCOVERED WORK. THAT WORKED AT CITY PAGES CONNECTED TO DO. I THINK IT IT VARIES BY CENTER IN OFFICE- CERTAINLY INVENT FACTIONS DISEASE GROUP IS MORE IMPACTED BUT ALSO THE FUNDERS ARE MARTINI AND IN TERMS OF USING THOSE STAFF AND REDIRECTING THEM BECAUSE THE SKILLS AND WHAT THEY LEARNED. IN QUEBEC RESPONSE I THINK HELPS THEM WITH THEIR DAY TO DAY JOB AS WELL. I'M SO I THINK IN OTHER AREAS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BACK FILL SOME OF THE POSITIONS WE'VE- REDIRECT IT WE'RE STARTING TO DO MORE OF THAT RELEASE OF THE RE DIRECTED STAFF. AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE PROGRAMS ARE JUST PICKING UP MORE WORK- AND SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE TIRED I. WILL GIVE YOU THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BOTH CALLED IN RESPONSE TO NONVIOLENT RESPONSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REALLY BUSY TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE WORK BUT- THERE ARE SOME AREAS AND WE DID SOME GAP ANALYSIS TO LOOK AT. WHERE WE WANT TO PICK UP SOME OF THAT WORK AND AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME NEW INITIATIVES THIS YEAR WERE SOME OF THE CENTERS ARE GOING TO. BE TAKING ON NEW ROLES AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BALANCING THAT AND THE KEY TO THAT IS HIRING AND WE'VE GOT TO DO A GOOD JOB OF USING THE DOLLARS WE HAVE TO FILL POSITIONS. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT- JUST MAKE NOTE THAT AGAIN PRE COATED- WE'VE HAD A COUPLE HEARINGS IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT PANDEMIC GUARD NOT TO SPEND I CAN OPERATE RESPONSIVENESS AND- FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HAD PREVIOUS. OUTBREAKS OF MEASLES AND SO FORTH. AND I'VE ASKED C. PH ABOUT WELL HOW MUCH THAT ACTUALLY COSTS THE STATE THEY'RE LIKE WELL WE WERE SO BUSY YOU KNOW TAKING CARE OF THE OUTBREAK WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TRACK HOW MUCH TIME WE'RE SPENDING SO. I HOPE THAT WE GET TO A STAFFING LEVEL WERE ACTUALLY CAN'T BECAUSE BABSON'S OF INFORMATION DOESN'T MEAN DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT YET WERE ABLE TO TRACK. AND PLAN AND BUDGET FOR THOSE IN THE FUTURE AND THEN FINALLY I JUST SAY IS I DO APPRECIATE IN THE PRESENTATION STATED PUBLIC HEALTH THE FOUR PILLARS. I HOPE WILL BE CONTINUING TO REFERENCE THOSE FOUR PILLARS AS WE TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ITEMS WERE GOING AT THROUGH THIS HEARING TODAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND DOCTOR BEHIND WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT SORT OF A COST ANALYSIS ON SOME OF THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BRINGING ON A HEALTH. ECONOMIST TO HELP US WITH SOME OF THAT AND ARE ALL. A CALL. IN PLACE. WILL AT OF THOSE. BE WE DO WANT TO. HAVE BETTER METRICS AND BETTER COSTUME. SO THAT WE- REALLY. TRACK THAT AND PROVIDE THAT IN. THANK YOU VERY AND I DIED BORNE EXPRESSED THANKS THE- IT'S LIKE WE'VE BEEN ON. A JOURNEY- THROUGH COVERT DR PAM POINTED OUT YOU CAN YOU SEE ON THE ON THE SCALE HOW IT JUST SHOOTS UP. SO I GUESS IT HAD TO TAKE ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS FOR PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE PUBLIC HEALTH. THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT UNTIL IT BECOMES A REAL CRISIS AND THEN WE REALIZED. THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM SO AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO. THANK YOU ALL AND AS YOU COME UP AND BEGIN TO BREATHE A LITTLE BIT- REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK TO CONTINUE TO DO FORWARD THINKING ABOUT- THE NEEDS AND OUR FOUR PILLARS. ONE QUESTION I WANT ANSWERED JUST OVER A LITTLE BIT ASIDE IS ANOTHER AREA PUBLIC HEALTH IS- INSPECTING. OUR FOOD IN RESTAURANTS AND SO- WALL ALSO CURIOUS ABOUT THROUGH THE PANDEMIC THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES IN. FOOD FOOD DELIVERY HOW YOU KNOW TRUCKS POPPING UP. HAS THERE BEEN HOW HAS IT BEEN TO TRACK ALL OF THE NEW. BUSINESS MODELS. FOR FOOD AND HAS THAT CREATED ANY EXTRA. HEALTH ISSUES. THAT WE WERE PREVIOUSLY AWARE OF. WE MIGHT ASK MARANDA JUMP IN. IT'S A REGARDING THE LOCAL FOOD AT RESTAURANTS. THOSE ARE ACTUALLY REGULATED BY THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. OF THE DEPARTMENT OR WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING AND LICENSING MANUFACTURERS THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY- SPECIFIC INCREASES IN COMPLAINTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. RELATED TO CRIME DURING COLD IT SO I'M NOT AWARE. OF ANY SPECIFIC INSURANCE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR USING HIS INTEREST WHEN WE THINK. OUR ENTIRE MODEL OF HOW WE GO OUT AND EAT AND SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS CHANGES IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF RAMIFICATIONS OR OR ANY LESSONS LEARNED. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE OKAY LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER. TWO OKAY I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GIVE US SOME TRADITION FOR THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE COVER NINETEEN ENDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A SIZE THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE INVESTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND EXPOSED SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN THE ABILITY O CDPH AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS RAPIDLY. FOR DECADES THE LEVEL OF HEALTH INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHAT IS NEEDED FOR A TRULY EQUITABLE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM THAT CAN KEEP CALIFORNIANS HEALTHY AND SAFE. THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH WORK GROUP BROUGHT TOGETHER LOCAL HEALTH EXECUTIVE HEALTH OFFICERS ADMINISTRATORS ADMINISTRATION LEADERSHIP TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. AND IDENTIFY CORE INFRASTRUCTURE IN FOUNDATIONAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE INVESTMENTS CAPABLE OF MEETING CURRENT AND FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. SEE PAGE REQUEST FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR POSITIONS AND SHE CAN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY TO MODERNIZE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM WITH THE GOAL OF PROTECTING AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. OF THESE RESOURCES- JUST OVER TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION WITH SUPPORT CALIFORNIA SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND NINETY NINE POINT SIX MILLION WITH SUPPORT STATEWIDE PUBLIC HEALTH. INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIORITY AT CDPH. TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSITION TO RESILIENCE SYSTEM RATHER THAN ONE DEPENDENT ON INTERMITTENT SHORT TERM FUNDING OR VARIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN SIX FOUNDATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE AREAS IDENTIFIED BY THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. THE FIRST ONE IS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT RECRUITMENT EVER TO EVER CHANGE THE CAPACITY AND ABILITY TO RECRUIT RETAIN AND DEVELOP A DIVERSE WORK FORCE. THIRTY PAGES PLAN INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POSITIONS AT FIFTY EIGHT MILLION TO INCREASE STAFFING CAPACITY AND TO ATTRACT DEVELOP AND RETAIN A DIVERSITY OF MULTI DISCIPLINARY PUBLIC. HEALTH WORK FORCE THAT CAN. FUN FACT OF THE TO THE TO NEXT UP HEALTH CHECK. THIS IS GOING TO BE A- ADDRESSING KEEPING GAPS WE'RE GOING TO BE DEVELOPING FR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE GONNA BE BILL AND ALL. OF POLICY AND- SO THAT WE CAN BE. DO SOME OF THE WORK THAT DUCK PANDA WAS TALKING ABOUT LOOK FORWARD AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN EXECUTE WITH OUR PARTNERS IN PROTECTING AND IMPROVING HEALTH. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG EMPHASIS ON PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT WERE BECOMING A LEAN ORGANIZATION FOCUSING ON ELIMINATING WASTE AND IMPROVING ITS OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOOD STEWARDS OF. THE PUBLIC'S- RETIREMENT FUNDING DEVELOPING A REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE SO WITH THAT WE CAN COORDINATE ACROSS THE STATE AND A BIG FOCUS ON RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. AND EXPECT A AREA IS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. THIS IS THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES OF ALL KINDS FROM NATURAL DISASTERS TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS TO BIOTERRORISM. CDPH IS PLANNING INCLUDES SEVENTY SEVEN POSITIONS AND TWENTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION FOR A SCALABLE AND SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURE. THAT CAN RAPIDLY IDENTIFY HAZARDS AND DEPLOYED RESOURCES TO MITIGATE. AND CONTAIN PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS. IT INCLUDES KEY INITIATIVE WE HAVE WHICH IS DEVELOP A TWENTY FOUR SO IN TOUCH. HOW HAVING A BILL TO BE ABLE TO REACT TO FOUR STAR FIRST LARGE HEALTH. WITH A POPULATION OF CLOSE TO FORTY MILLION PEOPLE- ALSO AN EMPHASIS ON. EVERY REBUILDING OUR- PLANNING TRAINING AND EXERCISE PROGRAM- ALSO STRENGTHENING OUR REGIONAL- RESOURCING MODEL WHERE WE HAVE WORKED WELL AGAIN WORKING IN A REGIONAL WAY AROUND AT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE AND THEN THE LAST COMPONENT IN THAT AREA IS HAVING A DEDICATED RECOVERY UNIT WELL AFTER ANY DISASTER WHETHER IT'S LOCAL OR OR CUTE THERE'S ALWAYS RECOVERY THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL. THE THIRD AREA IS AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DATA SCIENCE AND INFORMATICS MOST OF THAT MEAT IS GOING TO BE FELT THROUGH MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS WITH A SEPARATE BUDGET CHANGE BECAUSE ALL THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT THAT'S GOOD WE'RE ASKING HERE FOR THAT BIRTH DEFECTS. AND MONITORING PROGRAM WHICH IS THREE POSITIONS AT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS THE FOURTH AREA IS PUBLIC EDUCATION ENGAGEMENT AND BE HERE FOR A CHANGE AND THAT'S THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE TO DIVERSE PUBLIC HEALTH. PUBLIC AUDIENCES WITH TIMELY SCIENCE BASED INFORMATION I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT THE SAYS. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY HELP SHAPE THE NARRATIVE AROUND PROTECTING AND PROMOTING PROMOTING HEALTH AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION THAT'S HAPPENING HAS HAD A TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT AND SO WE HAVE TO. COMMUNICATE ON A REGULAR BASIS AND BUILD TRUST SO WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS PEOPLE WILL TRUST US WHEN WE WHEN WE WHEN WE ASK FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY CONTRIBUTE I REALLY DON'T FROM A LESSER INDIVIDUALLY INDIVIDUALISM PERSPECTIVE. TO MORE OF A COMMUNITY ORIENTATION AND PROTECTING PROTECTING YOUR COMMUNITY INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THIS WILL BE CREATING A CORE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION STRATEGY- ALSO GIVE ME A- IN. OUR TABLE CABLE. TO INFORMATION NUMBER FIVE THIS CAN PRK. EVERYTHING THE THINGS THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORK ON HER- BIG AND YOU'RE REALLY REQUIRES US TO WORKING WITH WITH PARTNERS- SEE PAGE PLANS TO INCLUDE FIVE POSITIONS AND TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO CHIEF HOLISTIC PARTNERSHIP NETWORK IT IS ENGAGED TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS. AND THAT'S DEVELOPING A MORE GONNA BE DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY PLAN BENNETT AND ALSO HAVING DEDICATED COMMUNITY. ENGAGEMENT PERSONNEL. WELL THE LAST AREA IS COMING. HOW IMPROVEMENT THE ABILITY TO SCALE PUBLIC. FROM HEALTH PROMOTION TO COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY THAT EMPHASIZES LIFE COURSE PERSPECTIVE THOSE PILLARS OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUT WHAT WE'LL DO THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC AREA IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE THROUGH KEY STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ESPECIALLY WITH WITH. THOSE THAT PROVIDE- HEALTH CARE BECAUSE A BIG PART OF BUT IMPORTANT PART OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM WHICH IS WHICH IS MORE THAN JUST THE AGENCY WHICH IS JUST FOR US IS THAT OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IS WHERE WHEN PEOPLE DO GET ILL THAT'S WHERE THEY GO AND THAT'S FOR A LOT OF THE METRICS THAT WE RELY ON. AND WE USE THOSE AS A AS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO TRACK HOW SUCCESSFUL WE ARE CALIFORNIA PLANS INCLUDE TWENTY THREE POSITIONS ARE SIX POINT OE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY THAT EMPHASIZES THE COLORS TODAY I MENTIONED. I'M LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS OF FINANCING- COMMUNITY HEALTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL EDUCATED DEDICATED COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT TEAM AND ALSO DEVELOPING A NEW BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AN IMPORTANT GAP AREA IN IN PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PREVENTION HOW CAN WE WORK TO REALLY BUILD RESILIENCY AND BUILD IT IN EARLY IN THE LIFE COURSE BECAUSE ONCE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE IT'S REALLY. WITH THAT THEN AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE SPENDING PLAN THAT'S A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO GO TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE. FOR THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS EVERY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS DIFFERENT NAMES WHAT IS CORE CROSS ALL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IT'S REALLY IT IS REALLY SUPPORTING AND EXPANDING THEIR WORK FIRST TO DEAL WITH ALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SO 70% OF THE FUNDS WILL GO TOWARDS SUPPORTING PUBLIC HEALTH- WORKFORCE EXPANSION. RECRUITMENT RETENTION ETCETERA. AND THEN OF COURSE REDUCING HEALTH HEALTH DISPARITIES. WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED IN A WAY THAT EMPHASIZES- HEALTH INEQUITIES BUT NOT JUST A LOT OF RACE AND ETHNICITY ALSO. SOCIAL AND GEOGRAPHIC INEQUITIES THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND RULE AREAS HAVE BEEN ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COVERAGE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- PAY ATTENTION. TO EVERY SINGLE AREA OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT EVERY EVERY INDIVIDUAL CALLS FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY DESERVES A- THE BEST PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION. OF COURSE FOCUSING ON DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THE LAST. THING I WANT TO MENTION IS FOR WE'RE WORKING- WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACCESS CENTER. TO COME UP WITH A COMMUNITY BENEFITS STRATEGY OR PROPORTION OF HOSPITAL COMMUNITY BENEFITS IS DEDICATED TO GO TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO SUPPORT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH TO REALLY HELP CHANGE THIS BROOKE TO REALLY GO UPSTREAM IN THE COMMUNITY WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS GUIDED BY THE COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH ASSESSMENTS THAT. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING TO REALLY MAKE THAT TRANSFORMATION HAPPEN IN THE WAY THAT MEETS THE LOCAL NEEDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OKAY W. THANK YOU SENATOR ADMIN AND DOCTOR PAN- WE THINK WE JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON ON THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK THE PLAN HAS A NUMBER OF MERITS FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING REAL TIME DISEASE SURVEILLANCE- COORDINATING REGIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND COMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVING STRATEGIC PLANNING THROUGH THE NEW OFFICE OF POLICY AND PLANNING. AND WE LIKE TO RATE THE REASON IDENTIFY A FEW ISSUES WHICH WE THINK IS ADDRESSED COULD- POTENTIALLY STRENGTHEN THE PLAN SO FIRST WE KNOW THAT THE PLAN DOES NOT- INCLUDES THREE- WHAT WE SEE AS KEY OBJECTIVES SO. FIRST ALTHOUGH IT HAS A MALL FACETED APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT TRAINING AND INTERNAL EDUCATION AND ADVANCEMENT FOR THE WORK FORCE IT DOESN'T CREATE A WORKFORCE PIPELINE. SECOND WE KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T- INCLUDE DISCUSSION ON STRENGTHENING THE STATE WIDE LAB NETWORK PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN THAT WORKS SPECIFICALLY SO THERE IS FUNDING AND- POSITIONS FOR THE STATE LAB AND FOR STATE LAB FIELD SERVICES BUT THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS OR PLANS FOR ENSURING THAT THE TWENTY EIGHT LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LABS. ARE STAFFED AND SUSTAINED. THIRD WE NOTE THAT- THE PLAN CURRENTLY DOES NOT LAY OUT AN OVER ARCHING I T. STRATEGY. SO THE DEPARTMENTS- NOTED TO OUR OFFICE THAT IT DOESN'T TEND TO HIRE A CHIEF I. T. STRATEGIST AND DEVELOPER- MORE OF A COMPREHENSIVE IT STRATEGY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. BUT WHEN THIS PLAN WILL BE AVAILABLE AND HOW THAT FUTURE- I. T. VERSION WOULD BE FUNDED IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR YET. NEXT WE NOTE THAT THE PLAN WE THINK COULD HAVE STRONGER OVERSIGHT OF THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS SO RIGHT NOW AS WRITTEN THE PLAN DOES NOT LAY OUT MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OR GOALS FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. WE DO KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES INTEND TO- COLLABORATE WITH THE LOCAL DEPARTMENTS ON ON THESE ISSUES- BUT WE THINK THAT- THIS IS AN AREA THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO- CONSIDER WEIGHING IN ON PLAN. HAS LOCAL LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH PLANS WOULD BE TIED TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS COMMUNITY EXISTING COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS WE JUST SENT OUT A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT THIS APPROACH FIRST I'M NOT ALL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY HAVE I'M A COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT- COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN I TURNER STANDING THAT THEY WOULD BE WORKING OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO JUST TO DEVELOP THESE AND- WE'RE NOT CLEAR IF THAT'S REALLY ENOUGH TIME TO DEVELOP SORT OF HIGH QUALITY- HEALTH ASSESSMENTS IMPROVEMENT PLANS. SECOND WE KNOW THAT THESE PLANS CAN SOMETIMES- THE COMMUNITY HEALTH- IN IMPROVEMENT PLANS CAN SOMETIMES ENCOMPASS SCHOOLS THAT ARE SORT OF BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. SUCH AS STRENGTHENING THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IT OR INCREASING STABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. SO WE RAISE THIS JUST TO SAY THAT TYING LOCAL HEALTH PLANS DIRECTLY TO THESE ARE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS. MAY NOT BE THE BEST SUBSTITUTE FOR HAVING SORT OF A MORE DELIBERATE AND CONSISTENT TYPE OF LOCAL PLAN A CALL ACROSS LOCAL DEPARTMENTS- HAVING A HAVING A MORE CONSISTENT TYPE OF LOCAL PLAN WOULD ALSO MAKE THE STATEWIDE EVALUATION EASIER. THE JUST A FEW ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONCERN- FIRST WE THINK- THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SO WORK FIRST PAY BLIND PUBLIC HEALTH LAB NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE AN OVER ARCHING I STRATEGY. WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER REQUIRING MORE CDPH MANAGEMENT OF THE LOCAL PLAN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS OVERSIGHT OF THE LOCAL- ON USE OF FUNDS- AND- AS I NOTED BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IDENTIFYING SOME OF THE COMMON PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS IT WOULD LIKE TO SEE- PRIORITISED ACROSS THE STREET. ACROSS THE STATE- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER SOME SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- FOR EXAMPLE DANIEL BATES OR AND OVER AT THE BENCH LEE A FIVE YEAR OR TEN YEAR REVIEW AND- IF IT WERE TO DO THAT TYPE OF GROUP REVIEW WE RECOMMEND- HAVING THAT CONDUCTED BY AN OUTSIDE PARTY- FINALLY WE NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO IMPLEMENT THE SPENDING PLAN. THROUGH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AND WE SUGGEST DEVELOPING INSTEAD TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH THE PLAN'S REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY. THANK THE DRUG ON CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT PIPELINE AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WORK FORCE ACROSS ALL ALL AREAS OF HEALTH. THIS NUMBER COME UP YOU WANT TO START DO YOU WANT ME TO START NO YEAH GO AHEAD. SO I THINK THEY'RE NOT OF THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO DO TO TRY TO BUILD THE PIPELINE. ONE YEAH WE HAVE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM GOALS AS WE LOOK AT OUR WORK FORCE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AN AGING POPULATION AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO RECRUIT- I'M MORE DIVERSE. WORK FORCE AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING IS. REALLY LOOKING AT I'M TRYING TO DO A FIRST OFF A PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN WHAT IS PUBLIC HEALTH WHY DO YOU. WHY SHOULD YOU COME TO WORK FOR PUBLIC HEALTH HOW IS IT DISTINCT FROM HEALTH CARE AND WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH OUR LOCAL. HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO COME UP WITH THAT TIME AND WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT'LL BE A START TO TRAIN TO ATTRACT NOT ONLY. PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO MAYBE STUDENTS AND OTHERS WE PUT IN PLACE THIS YEAR WHAT WE'RE CALLING OUR PATHWAYS PROGRAM WHERE WE'VE TAKEN FORTY FIVE PEOPLE FROM. VERY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND PLACED THEM WE HAVE A TRAINING PROGRAM WE PLACED FORTY FIVE PEOPLE IN ACROSS THE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. ALL AND BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER SO THEY THEY GET SOME STATE EXPERTISE AND TRAINING BUT THEY ALSO GOT SOME LOCAL EXPERIENCE AND WE THINK IT'S A WAY NOT ONLY TO GROW THE PIPELINE. TO GET PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THIS WORK TO GET THEM EXPERIENCE THAT THEY QUALIFY FOR SOME OF THE HEALTH- POSITIONS BUT ALSO WE CAN PLACE THEM IN SOME OF THE COUNTIES THAT STRUGGLE TO. TO HIRE AND SO THAT'S ONE WAY TO GROW THE PATHWAY WE ARE WORKING AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ON. OUR INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AND THE IMPACT IT WE'VE HIRED PROBABLY A THIRD OF THE INTERNS THAT COME TO OUR DEPARTMENT. ACROSS THE CSU ON CAMPUSES. AND WE WANT TO EXPAND THAT AND WE WANT TO DO MORE WITH HIGH SCHOOLS AS WELL- AND OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALSO WANT TO BECAUSE I CAN. SAY WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULDN'T HE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT A CAREER IN PUBLIC HEALTH. I SCHOOL STUDENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS NECESSARILY MAYBE NOT WITH THE PANDEMIC. THAT'S CHANGING A LITTLE BIT BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO TRY TO MAKE PUBLIC. YOU KNOW PEOPLE KNOW WHAT A FIREMAN AS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT A PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER ANTS AND SO. HOW DO WE START TO REALLY GROW THAT HOW WE PARTNER MORE WITH THE- INSTITUTE. AND WITH OUR COME BASED OR- BECAUSE THEY EXPERIENCE THAT THEY- THE COMMUNITY. CAN BE HELP TO. PUBLIC HEALTH FORWARD SHOULD BUT pHAVE. THAT WE LOOK AT THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS WERE LIVED EXPERIENCE CAN BE AS- IMPORTANT. AND THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AS SOME OF THE ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS THAT WE MAY HAVE BEEN SO WE MAY NEED TO. HAVE SOME NEW CLASSIFICATIONS THAT HELP US TO BUILD THAT PIPELINE AS WELL. AND SO TRYING TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS ACROSS. THE STATE TO TRY TO ADD TRACKED MORE AND A BUILD A PIPELINE WITH SCHOOLS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND BY LOOKING FURTHER INTO OUR WHAT WE LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND PROBABLY HAVE KNOWN. FOR SOME TIME AS WE NEED TO ATTRACT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT SKILLS THAT. TRADITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH AT B. WE NEED ALL OF THAT WE NEED OUR SCIENTISTS. BUT WE ALSO NEED THE STRATEGISTS AND WE NEED PEOPLE WHO. BUILD STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WE NEED INFOGRAPHICS PEOPLE WE NEED TO. HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF POSITIONS THAT. FILL OUT OUR WORK FORCE AND SO REALLY. KIND OF LOOKING ACROSS THE DIFFERENT. SECTOR OF SOCIETY LOOKING WALK WHAT CAN WE ADD TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORK FOR. HOUSING HELPS WITH THAT. I THINK. IT'S BEEN SO LONG WE'VE JUST BEEN IN THE TRENCHES. THERE HASN'T BEEN- THE TIME OR ATTENTION TO KINDA LOOK UP AND LOOK FORWARD. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LAB NETWORK WE ALL HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- AND THEN OFTENTIMES COUNTIES WERE CONTRACTING WITH LAB SAID. THAT WEREN'T QUITE REPUTABLE ANALYSTS DID UP A DISASTER WITH DATA. BEING ABLE TO GET AROUND CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MORE ABOUT THE LAB NETWORK. LOCALLY AND THE INVESTMENT OUR OUR PLANS FOR FUTURE INVESTMENT IN THAT. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT TIME LINE FOR PUTTING THIS PLAN TOGETHER DIDN'T ALLOW US ENOUGH TIME. BUT WE REALLY ARE THINKING THROUGH WHAT. NOT ONLY HOW MANY LABS DO WE NEED ACROSS THE STATE AND PUBLIC HEALTH BUT WHAT SHOULD THEY BE DOING. AND WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH LABS AT WHAT LEVEL SHOULD TAKE ON WHAT WORK BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE- DUPLICATION. WE RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO HAVE A STRONG LABORATORY NETWORK WHERE. EVERY STATE EVERY COUNTY HAS ACCESS TO THE TESTING THAT THEY NEED AND SO WE WILL BE COMING BACK TO THAT. IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW OUR LABS HAVE BEEN WORKING ACROSS THE NETWORK TO MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO THINK THROUGH WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND WE'RE PROBABLY SIX MONTHS UNDER BRAND IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS ON THIS BUT WE'RE PROBABLY. SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR OUT AND MAKING SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THEY'RE- LOOKING AT RECRUITMENT LOOKING AT TRAINING- YOU KNOW IT'S- REALLY HARD FOR US WHEN WE HEAR THAT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HAS ALL THE EQUIPMENT AND THEY CAN'T FIND A LAB DIRECTOR AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THEIR LAB OPEN BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A LAB DIRECTOR- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE TRAINING PROGRAMS WE HAVE AGAIN. A PIPELINE TO BRING PEOPLE AND TO YOU OUR LABORATORY POSITIONS AND RELATED TRAINING THEM AND SO WE PUT SOME MONEY. ON IN OUR- MAN PLAN THAT WOULDN'T. TRAINING FOR LAB AS- AND I KNOW. THAT THE COALITION ALSO HAS SOME. ON FURTHER TRAINING. T. WE'RE- EXPAND ON OUR LABORATORY NETWORK. AND I DON'T KNOW IF TOMAS OR BRANDON HAVE ANY MORE TO SAY ON THE LAB. YEAH NOT NOTHING TRACK. OKAY AND SPEAKING OF THE LAB AND LOCALS IT. AS AS YOU SERVE AS A HUB AND I KNOW OUR MIGHT MIGHT HELP DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN IN A LOT OF CONTACT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. ABOUT COUNTIES THAT ARE POLLUTING- SPECIAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS AT A HIGHER RATE AND IF THE PLAN AS OF THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT COULD HAS A PLAN OF WHAT WE DO IF WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO SEND MORE RESOURCES. TO THIRTY TWO COUNTIES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED WITH THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH BUT HAVE HIGH DEGREES OF- OF DISEASE AND NEED IN THEIR AREAS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CAP CAPACITY BUILDING THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE DOLLARS WERE- ALLOW US TO DO MORE- I'M WE WILL ALSO HELP TO TRY TO RECRUIT. PEOPLE FOR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND USE SOME STRATEGIES LIKE THE PATHWAYS PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN PLACE PEOPLE BUT ALSO WORKING WITH CONTRACTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC TO PLACE PEOPLE IN SOME OF THESE HARD TO PLACE. COUNTIES WHERE YEAH THEY HAVE EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE THE DOLLARS AND THEY HAVE THE POSITION THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT AND SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT MODELS OF BRINGING PEOPLE AND DOING SOME ROTATIONS MAYBE BRING A MAN TO A STATE POSITION BUT- HAVING THEM ROTATE THROUGH- AND- I THINK WE HAVE SOME MODELS FOR THAT CDC CERTAINLY HAS SOME MODELS FOR THAT. AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE WE DO YOU KNOW WE KNOW. THAT THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE THAT GO. AFP OUT. TIME AND TIME TO IT. PEOPLE IN THE SAME POSITION. THEY LOSE PEOPLE THE OTHER COUNTIES THEY LOSE PEOPLE TO OTHER POSITINS SO- BUT THAT CAPACITY BUILDING WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE. HAS THAT IN MIND AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN BE A BETTER RESOURCE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOKING AT- IS OUR REGIONAL. HEALTH OFFICE WHERE WE WILL HAVE AN F. B. NFP PERSON. YEAH I'M COORDINATING POSITION AND THAT WILL BE A RESOURCE TO YOU NOT ONLY. TO THE REGION BUT ALSO TO SPECIFIC COUNTIES THAT MAY NEED A LITTLE MORE HELP WITH THAT WITH THEIR F. B. DATA MAY NEED I'M A LITTLE MORE HELP LOOKING BROADER AT AN ISSUE AND SHARING THE RESOURCES FROM OTHER COUNTIES AS WELL AS SHARING SOME STATE RESOURCES SO THAT'S KIND OF THE IDEA. THAT THE REASONS CAN BE A RESOURCE AND IF WE HAVE STAFF AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT CAN HELP MANAGE THAT THAT WE CAN BUILD A BUILD THAT OUT AND REALLY LOOK AT THOSE AREAS OF CONCERN. THANK YOU AND I GUESS I JUST LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT I'M SURE YOU'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THIS BUT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO DEPLOY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. FOR STAFF TO AN AREA IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT THAT WE ALSO JUST DEPLOY. EXTRA COMMUNITY- EDUCATION TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION THAT HAPPENS THAT IF THAT IS A THAT IS A SIGN IF PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DISINFORMATION IN AN AREA SO WE'RE DEPLOYING JUST MORE PEOPLE I THINK WE HAVE TO BE MORE HOLISTIC AND HOW WE LOOK AT GOING INTO TO HELP. INTERVENE. IN SITUATIONS TO KEEP THE PUBLIC HEALTHY. I THINK. BUT THE PATH. THAT THING YOU SO VERY MUCH AND- FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE LA- FOR THEIR REPORTS- THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN AND ALSO THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN RAISING THESE ISSUES FOR YEARS- EVEN PRE COATED. WITH A SET OF MENTIONED- I'VE CHAIRED TWO HEARINGS ONCE WHEN IWAS IN THE ASSEMBLY CHAIR OF SIMPLY HEALTH AND THEN IN THE SENATE- PRIOR TO COVE ID ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE I'VE KNOWN I KNOW I'VE CHALLENGED MY- NOT DIRECTOR GOING YOUR YOUR YOUR PREDECESSORS TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP A PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. IN FACT I THINK A- RATE IT WILL REINSTATE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN TWENTY TWENTY HAS COVERED WAS STARTING AND- THAT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I ASKED DIRECTOR THEN- IT'S HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY. IN A GUEST YOU KNOW AGAIN I. APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION- BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- WHAT THE ALLEY--POINTED OUT- SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE NOT BEEN ANY SURPRISE. TO ANYONE AT C. P. H. SO I THINK WE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE A WORKFORCE ISSUE NOW SOME OF THAT OF COURSE IS OUR FAULT IN PUBLIC POLICY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN TERMS OF FUNDING- A SHARED A FUNDING STREAM THAT WAS STABLE WAS NOT NECESSARILY THAT MAKES ALWAYS HARD FOR WORK FORCE RIGHT. I MEAN IT'S GREAT YOU CAN EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH. THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE A JOB AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A STAY IN A JOB THAT IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO RECRUIT RIGHT SO. SO I DO WANT A KNOWLEDGE THAT- SO THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT WE CAN DO THAT THIS IS A COMMITMENT. FOR AN ONGOING COMMITMENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A BILL THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE UNLESS PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE WORKERS THERE. THE WORK IS DEFINITELY THERE BUT THAT THEY WOULD BE PAID THAT THAT- THE JACKS POSITIONS TO DO THAT WORK. THE LAND ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER A DECADE AND- THAT I HAVE ANY KIND OF DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DON'T HAVE AND I'M HEARING THE. RESPONSES LIKE ALL WE NEED ANOTHER YEAR. WE'VE KNOWN. THIS HAS BEEN A PROPERTY IN FACT BUT THE ME JUST LAY OUT. LAST YEAR. THE LEGISLATOR SAID WE WANT A COMMITMENT FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION THE ADMINISTRATION SAID WELL WE'LL START IT NEXT YEAR HAVE YOU HAD A YEAR'S WARNING IN ADVANCE WE'RE COMING SINCE DOING THIS- AND THEN OF COURSE BEEN TALK ABOUT LAB IS AN ISSUE. EVEN BEFORE THEN FOR A LONG TIME. SO FENCING WITH BY THE WAY IN TERMS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS WELL. AND SO I GUESS- SO FIRST OF COURSE I WANT TO. IT'S TEN STRONG SUPPORT OF WHAT THE LA BROUGHT UP IN THE NIGHT AND I DON'T KNOW ILLEGAL MAYBE YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS PREVIOUS HEARINGS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT PIPELINE. WORKFORCE LAB INFRASTRUCTURE I. T. AND THEN ALSO- OVERSIGHT THE LOCAL OVERSIGHT NOW THAT WE ARE PUTTING SOME STATE FUNDS AND HERE I THINK IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. AND THAT WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT. NINE REALIZE THAT RIGHT NOW THERE'S NEVER A GOOD TIME BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A PANDEMIC SO EVERYONE'S REALLY BUSY AT CDPH DEALING WITH THIS PANDEMIC. BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED AS I'M HEARING SOME OF THE ANSWERS IS THAT- YOU KNOW I'LL JUST BE BLUNT- SOMETIMES C. PH HAS A REPUTATION OF TAKING ITS TIME GETTING THINGS DONE- YEAH WE'VE HAD REGULATIONS THAT- WE PASS LAWS AND- I REMEMBER HAVING A HEARING BECAUSE THERE'S A- BECAUSE C. PH AFTER TEN YEARS STILL HADN'T ISSUED REGULATIONS AND WE FINALLY. SOMEONE OFFERED A BILL TO TAKE CARE OF THE DETAILS. AND SO FORTH SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO ME ABOUT. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO SO. SO IS THERE A WAY WE CAN DO THIS FASTER. YEAH THESE ARE NEW PROBLEMS I MEAN WE KNOWN THESE THINGS FOR ALL THE TIME SO YEAH WE HAD AND WE EVEN HAD A YEAR'S NOTICE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE HUNDRED MILLION. THAT'S COMING. SO IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN WE CAN WE DO THIS FASTER PLEASE- I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU- YOU KNOW AND I CAN'T CHANGE THAT IN JANUARY IS MY FIRST YEAR. YES AND I REALIZE YOU JUST CAME IN JANUARY. AND SO I FOUND YOU BUT NO BUT I BUT I'VE BEEN IN PUBLIC HEALTH NOW. SAID IN IN. HEALTH OFFICERS FROST IS NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND I SPEND. MOST MY TIME IN SAN FRANCISCO- BUT ANYWAYS I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF. CONTRAST OF THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOCAL AND LOCAL AT LEAST LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M FROM THE BAY AREA. AND I AND I MEAN IT'S ONE OF THE FOR THINGS I. WHEN I CAME HERE TO STAY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS THAT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS IT IT'S A BARE BONES INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S BARE BONES. AND WHEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF. THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IT BECAME A STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SEPARATE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN TWENTY OH SIX MMHM YEAH AND IT WHEN T WAS CREATED IF. IT DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE NECESSARY COMPONENTS. AND THE N. WORD WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW IS BEGINNING TO REAP BUILDING SOME OF THOSE COMPONENTS. A LOT OF THOSE COMPONENTS ARE ARE ARE THINGS THAT ARE OPERATIONAL. FOR EXAMPLE- NOT HAVING A DEDICATED ROBUST OFFICE OF POLICY AND PLANNING. YOU NEED A TEAM OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STORED DO INDEED VANCE PLANNING STRATEGIZING. FIGURING OUT WHERE WHERE WE'RE GONNA MOVE WE'RE WE'RE GETTING NOT JUST TO DO A REPORT BUT HOW DO YOU MAKE HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT DEPORT. REPORT COMBINED WITH EVIDENCE AND THEN TWO AND THEN TO WORK WITH PARTNERS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SO THERE THERE IS A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THAT HAS BEEN MISSING. AND FOR ME THAT'S THE REASON WHY I CAME FROM LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH. BECAUSE I ANTICIPATED IT JUST WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOME OF THIS MONEY AND FIX SOME OF THESE ISSUES. I AGREE WITH YOU WE DO THINGS WE DO THINGS- NOT FAST ENOUGH- AND I'M REALLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS. WHY IT WERE AT AS AN ORGANIZATION. OR HAVING A STRONG. THE FOCUS ON BECAUSE A LEADER. TO ME SURE THAT WE DO THING FAST. AND BETTER FOR CUT. THE ULTIMATE BECAUSE- WHICH IS EVERY CAL. BUT ALL THE BUILD THE LEAD. AS WELL THEY WERE ACCOUNTABLE TO YOU AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T WE DELIVER. OUTCOMES UT WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT SEE EFFICIENT. AND THEY WERE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE THAT BUT WHAT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S TENDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT- YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO DO THINGS RIGHT- IS THAT- PEOPLE WANT TO THIS REALLY THOROUGH YOU KNOW ANALYSIS AND WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE YOU DATA AT CETERA. AND THEN WE SAID ONE TOTALLY GATHER ALL THAT TOGETHER WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING. RIGHT AND THEN IT'S GONNA TAKE US TWO OR THREE YEARS TOGETHER ALL THAT GREAT IN FACT ACTUALLY PUBLIC HEALTH DID DO. SOME MANY YEARS AGO. THEY DID THIS BIG THING WHERE EVERY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT CETERA AND THEN THEY CAME OUT WITH A REPORT IT SAID ON THE SHELF AND THE BY THE TIME WE GOT BACK TO IT IT'S LIKE WELL IT'S KINDA OLD NOW IT'S NOT REALLY RELEVANT. AND LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. SO I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPEN- I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE LOCAL OVERSIGHT WHEN THEY HEAR FROM SOME OF THE LOCALS- IN THE PANEL COMING UP. IT REALLY IS TO BE SURE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A STATEWIDE. PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM SO AND THAT OF COURSE WE HAVE C. PH AT STATE BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE OF COURSE ALL THE OTHER PIECES AS WELL. WE WANNA BE SURE THAT IT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPERTY IN SILENCE SO FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN NO YOU BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON THIS R. R. IS THAT- SO. YOU KNOW WE KNOW DISEASES DON'T STOP AT POLITICAL BOUNDARIES RIGHT SO OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE OFTEN DEFINED BY POLITICAL BOUNDARIES BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S A COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR CITY HELP APART WHATEVER RIGHT SO. HOW DO WE GET AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE WORK I KNOW YOU CAME TO THE BAY AREA THERE WAS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE BAY AREA HEALTH OFFICERS HOW WE DO MORE OF THAT BUT THEN ALSO HOW CAN THE STATE. ALSO PROVIDE INCENTIVES. AND ALSO INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT AND CAN I GET IT YOU GOT BARE BONES SO HOW CAN WE BUILD THAT IN WITH THIS INVESTMENT. AND THEN. THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY TO SO THAT THE STATE MY MANY IS. THE ONLY COURSE PORTING. YEAH THEY GO TO A LOCAL SINCE. TO LOW ACTIVITY BUT ALL. THAT THE- ALSO IN. FOR THEM BE WORKING TOGETHER SO WORKING WITH. BY THAT'S THE LAVISH. A PRIME EXAMPLE WHERE. BASICALLY H. K. WAS A ON THERE- OWN FIGURE. HOW TO DO THEIR LAB. RIGHT AND THEN. IF DECIDE TO. A LOT AND THE WAY WHAT KIND OF IT'S A WORKFORCE. I APPRECIATE. OUT IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT ALLOWED TO CONFINE THE LAB DIRECTOR RATES. SO WE HAVE TO BUILD THAT WORK FORCE OUT TOO BUT- WE SHOULD HAVE A- SO. SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY SHOULD BE CONSENSUS IMAC THINKING ABOUT OKAY SO WHICH LANDS DO WE NEED BOTH STATE LAB. AND LOCAL LABS RIGHT DO WE YEAH DO WE NEED TO CONVINCE THE COUNTY TO OPEN ONE UP. DO WE HAVE TO IS THAT SO. BUT THESE ARE BEING DONE SYSTEMATICALLY IS KIND OF DONE BY. SO I CAN'T EVEN MAKE A DECISION AND THEN ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES AROUND WOULD HAVE TO JUST THAT RIGHT WHETHER DATE IS. MAY DECIDE TO CLOSE THE LAB SO- SO WE NEED MUCH MORE. SO WE THINK WE DO NEED TO HAVE A- DIRECTION TOWARD. THIS COLLABORATION TO BUILD A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. AND OF COURSE I MEAN IDEALLY NATIONALLY AS WELL BUT- CERTAINLY SOME TOWARDS THE GOVERNMENT. A CALIFORNIA BIG STATE. HOW DO WE BUILD OUT SOON WITH THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING MUCH MORE ABOUT THAT. AND THE NEXT ITEM. BECAUSE THIS PARTY ONLY A LITTLE PIECE OF IT HERE. RIGHT WE NEED A STATEWIDE PUBLIC HEALTH IT SYSTEM THAT INTERFACES ACTION WITH ALL THE OTHER HEALTH. IT SYSTEMS AS WELL RIGHT BECAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE RIGHT NOW UNTIL THAT WE'RE HEARING STORIES ABOUT. LITERALLY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. GETTING RESULTS FAXED OVER THEM. FACT THESE FAXES ARE ACTUALLY IN HELL CARE ALSO WE DO BILLING AND SELF I MEAN THAT THAT AND THEN SOME HAS TO TAKE A PIECE OF SENATE EASIER TO KNOW WHAT TRY IF DOES AND THEN TAKE IT BACK TO THESE OF PAPER THEN RE ENTER ELECTRO INTO THE THIS IS RIGHT UP A LOT OF WAYS TO TIME AND F. AND PROBABLY VERY TELL FIRST WHO YOU WANT I CAN PUT HEALTH DOESN'T TO BE. PICKING UP A FAX AND THEN AND DATA AND THAT'S REAL PUBLIC HEALTH OKAY BUT WE'RE USING PUBLIC HEALTH PERSONNEL TO DO THAT RIGHT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A GREAT ADVERTISEMENT FOR DOING PUBLIC HEALTH- THE OTHER THING I ALSO JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON BRIEFLY UNFORTUNATELY IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKFORCE AT LEAST WITH THIS PANDEMIC. SAFETY WE'VE HAD LOCAL PUBLIC. OFFICE BASICALLY GET DEATH THREATS PUBLIC. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN. BRITAIN AND BULLIED- AND- YOU KNOW THAT'S AGAIN GONNA BE AN ISSUE FOR WORK FORCE- RETENTION AND SO FORTH AND- AND SO A REALIZES THAT PERHAPS A BIGGER CONVERSATION THAN JUST CD PH BUT CERTAINLY SEE IF EACH OTHER ROLE IN. CONVERSATION WITH THE MINISTRATION MORE BROADLY BUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY FOLKS AND SO FORTH- BOTH THE SAFETY PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS HAND ALSO ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS RIGHT FOLLOWING THE LAW LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO ENFORCE THE LAW. SO IN THE LAW AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE OF PUBLIC SAFETY. OUR RIGHT I MEAN I THINK HE I THINK WAS REALLY BEFORE RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF VERY. BRAVE PUBLIC SAFETY- FIRST RESPONDERS OUT THERE PUBLIC HEALTH IS PUBLIC SAFETY HE DIED OF A DISEASE YOU'RE JUST AS YOU DIED OF A BULLET. AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT. SO SO ANYWAY I KNOW YOU ANY COMMENTS BUT WE JUST SAID BUT AGAIN I. GO I APPRECIATE YOU RECOGNIZING THESE ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PUSHING ON YOU. ON THIS AS WELL- BUT WE LIKE TO SEE MORE DETAILS BY TIME WE ACTUALLY PASSED A BUDGET SO RELEASES THE FIRST CUT BUT ALSO IT'S NOT RECOGNIZED IT THESE ARE NO THESE ARE NOT NEW ISSUES WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME SO. WHEN I HEAR YOU NEED MORE YEARS TO FIGURE IT OUT. LITTLE FRUSTRATED SO NOW. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. ALL YOUR SUPPORT YOUR SUPPORT AND- EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY IS VALID- WEEK WE RECOGNIZE IT. AND WORK FOR COMMITTED TO. COMMITTED TO DELIVER RESULTS INTO BEING ACCOUNTABLE AND WORKING WITH YOU IN PARTNERSHIP TO TRY. TO BECOME A BETTER A BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ONE OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED IS THAT. DAY I FEEL THAT I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO BEING IN SITUATIONS WHERE. LOCALLY AND THAT'S A STATE WITH A LEGISLATOR TO REALLY HAVE. THE SUPPORT OF ELECTED OFFICIALS IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD AND SO. I'M I'M REALLY INSPIRED AND HOPEFUL AND CONFIDENT. THAT ITH YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT WE WILL WE'LL BE ABLE TO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE. MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH MEDIA. AND ON THAT LOCAL OVERSIGHT WE WILL BE PROVIDING MORE DETAILS ON THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT JOHN THE CHIP IS NOT THE END ALL FOR EVERYTHING AND THAT THEY ARE MY OFTEN BIGGER. WE ARE CONNECTING TO THE STRATEGIC PLANS WE MET THIS WEEK WITH. OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN. REALLY LOOK AT SOME STATEWIDE METRICS AND WE ARE SETTING UP A TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE. RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING RESPONDS AND GETTING THE FUNDS OUT THE DOOR BUT ALSO. LOOKING AT HOW THEY ARE GETTING SPAN TO WHAT THEY'RE BEING SPENT ON AND THEN HOW WE SET UP METRICS SO THAT WE CAN TRACK AND EVALUATE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HAVING. YOU ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE WITH THESE DOLLARS SO MORE. TO COME ON THAT AND WE WILL. WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE ALL OF THAT IN PLACE. JULY FOR. OKAY THAK YOU I DO SAY IT IT'S SET UP. YOU MY FAVE PART. TELL ME WHAT YOU. THANK YOU. WE THANK DR PRATT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP OVER THE YEARS. HE HAS BEEN THE- THE POKER IN THE PRIOR ON THIS END AND NOW HE- HE HAS CERTAINLY PROVED HIMSELF TO BE RIGHT AND SO WE WANT TO GO FORWARD AND- I'M NOT JUST BEING RIGHT OR WRONG BUT JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE PUBLIC SAY SAFE AND- AGAIN. WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE PANDEMIC BY CUSTOMER BASE BY SURPRISE BUT- WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO BUILD UP OUR SYSTEM OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM. THEM OUR OUR PANEL SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE MICHELLE GIBBONS A COMMUNITY HEALTH EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA. GONNA HAVE MATT PLEASE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ADVOCATE FOR SJ U. CALIFORNIA. KAREN SAVAGE SWING SWING IN CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK OR C. FAN AND MATTHEW MARCIN SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT. OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE AND ALL OUR GUESTS OUR PANELIST. I WILL PROVIDE A LIST OF QUESTIONS TO HELP GUIDE THEM IN THEIR- PRESENTATIONS TO US AND WE WOULD THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SURE MEMBERS MACHEL GIVENS WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO THANK THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE. LEADER LAST LEADERSHIP LAST YEAR AND PRIORITIZING FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE THREE HUNDRED MILLION I'M GOING FOR STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL BEGIN TO REBUILD OUR DECIMATED WORKFORCE OUR MEMBERS WE UTILIZE THIS FUNDING TO RETAIN STAFF HIRED DURING THE- DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH FEDERAL ONE TIME CODE NINETEEN FUNDS. AS WELL AS ADDING NEW STAFF AND EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF THEIR DEPARTMENT. IN REGARDS TO HOW THE STATE CAN SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING OUR SMALL RURAL JURISDICTIONS SEVERAL STRATEGIES COME TO MIND MANY THAT SEEM TO ALIGN WITH WORDS WHAT DOCTOR ARE GOT HIS START AS STATED EARLIER- STRATEGIC PLANNING. PROVIDING CLEAR GUIDANCE ON STATEWIDE PRIORITIES AND ACTIONABLE TOOLS THAT CAN SUPPORT LOCAL APPROACHES. ALSO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON VARIOUS FUNDING STREAMS IN GRANTS IN AN EFFORT TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS AND FURTHER STATEWIDE PRIORITIES HELP TO REBUILD OUR WORKFORCE BY INCREASING TRAINING PROGRAMS IN PROVIDING STATEWIDE TRAININGS ON VARIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH TOPICS SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE WITH CONTACT TRACING- TRAININGS THAT WERE PROVIDED DURING THE PANDEMIC. COURTNEY COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO ACHIEVE STATEWIDE GOALS AND AVOID DUPLICATION AND DESPERATE EFFORTS. PROVIDE REAL TIME MODELING AND DATA ON PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND FOR SMALL RURAL JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE DATA THAT IS JURISDICTION SPECIFIC AND DOES NOT WANT THEM IN WITH OTHER SMALLER JURISDICTIONS GIVEN THEIR UNIQUE COMMUNITIES. ACCESS THAT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LANDSCAPE IN STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND LEAD EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE PUBLIC HEALTH IT SYSTEMS. AND THEN CONTINUED- DETAILED EVALUATION OF THE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING LAB CAPACITY AND WORKFORCE PIPELINE TO BUILD A ROAD MAP FOR CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE PREPARED TO ADDRESS PRESENT AND FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT WORKFORCE AND RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CHALLENGES MANY EXISTED. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT IT ONLY BEEN A- BY BURNING. ARREST A PUBLIC OFFICIAL IN A COME. WITH SECTOR THEIR- NETWORKS THE HOST. WHEN OPERA. ARE AVAILABLE AND OFTEN IMPLEMENT GROW YOUR OWN STRATEGIES WHERE THEY HIRE SOMEONE TO HELP THEM ATTAIN THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION. DESPITE HIS BEST EFFORTS A MORE ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS NEEDED. THIS IS WHY OUR CALIFORNIA CAN'T WAIT COALITION IS ALSO SEEKING ONE TIME FUNDING FOR A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES INCLUDING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STIPENDS. ELIMINATION OF COST BARRIERS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE CERTIFICATIONS AND VARIOUS TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WOULD SUPPORT A MUCH NEEDED WORKFORCE PIPELINE INCLUDE THE EXPANSION OF THE PATHWAYS PROGRAM THE MISSPELLING MENTIONED EARLIER. AND THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S NO. CURRENT FUNDING TO EXPAND THAT TODAY. THESE CRITICAL TRAIN INVEST WOULD ALLOW NEW ANY. HOME HEALTH STAFF TIME TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL EDUCATION AND ON THE JOB SKILLS IN ESSENTIAL AREAS OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS MICROBIOLOGY EPIDEMIOLOGY AMONG OTHERS. THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE FROM DIVERSE AND UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS. ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY DIRECTORS AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CERTIFIED MICROBIOLOGIST IN TRAINED EPIDEMIOLOGIST. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENT I'D BE HAPPY TO GO INTO DETAIL ON OUR COALITION BUDGET REQUEST. AND I'M ALSO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT NUMBER IS GIVEN WE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION- WE'LL HEAR FROM METAL IS NOW. IT LEADS LADY HOW IS IT. EARNINGS LUCE LUCE OKAY CLOSE UP NO PROBLEM- MY NAME IS JAY ON BEHALF OF S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA AND FIRST AND FOREMOST ONE AT STAKE THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR PRIORITIZING FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. WE DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY% PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE THREE HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING FOR STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS A COMMITTEE IS WIDELY AWARE AND WE'VE JUST HEARD A COUPLE PRESENTATIONS ON IT PUBLIC HEALTH IS A CORE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS REALLY HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PANDEMIC IN AFTER YEARS OF UNDERFUNDING- AND SHORTAGES TIME IS NOW TO INVEST IN PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND RETAIN STOP AND HAVE BEEN TRAINED OUT DURING THE PANDEMIC AS WELL AS ADDING ADDITIONAL STAFF TO MEET THE LONG STANDING STAFFING SHORTAGES. MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEEN RAVAGED MICHAEL THAT NINETEEN OUT MORE DEVASTATING LEVELS AND WHATEVER OCCURRED HOW LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY STAFFED AND RESOURCE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- WITH THIS FUNDING WE BELIEVE THAT I WILL BE BETTER PREPARED TO ADDRESS AND RESPOND TO KOBE NINETEEN AS IT CONTINUES TO RUN. THROUGH THE ENDEMIC IN FUTURE HEALTH EMERGENCIES PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE TRULY TEAM ENVIRONMENTS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTIGATORS ANALYSTS EDUCATORS HAVE BEEN EPIDEMIOLOGIST LAB SCIENTISTS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS IMPORTANTLY THERE ARE OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS IN EVERYDAY COMMUNICABLE DISEASES- OUTSIDE IN SEPARATE FROM COVE IN NINETEEN AND- UNFORTUNATELY THE PANDEMIC IS OVERSHADOWED MUCH OF THIS WORK DUE TO THE LIMITED CAPACITY SINCE STOPPING AT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. CALIFORNIA CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HITS INSTEAD WE MUST INVEST REBUILD OUR CORE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. AND INFRASTRUCTURE NOW. THIS IS WHY WE'RE DOING WITH OUR- AND COLLEGE CAN'T WAIT. TO SEE ONE TIME. FOR A VARIETY OF STRIDE TO PRIME THE WORK FORCE. AND RECRUIT UPSKILL AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORK WORKERS AND DIVERSIFY THE WORKFORCE. AS WE FOUND DURING THE PANDEMIC HAVING PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS THAT COME FROM THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE HOW TO BUILD PUBLIC TRUST. AND THIS ADDITIONAL WORK FORCE FUNDING IS VITAL TO CONTINUE DIVERSIFYING THE WORKFORCE- THESE CRITICAL TRAINING INVESTMENTS WE SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL EDUCATION ON THE JOB SKILLS AND ESSENTIAL. FUNCTIONS ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE SKILLS ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT WORKERS HAVE BEEN DOING DURING THE PANDEMIC IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKERS TO. BROADEN THEIR SKILL SET TO ADDRESS THE MANY CHALLENGES FACING PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. GIVING STOCK GIVEN STOP SHORTAGES AND LIMITED FUNDING IT PREVIOUSLY- THE BACKFILL FUNDING IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE- HAVE THAT ABILITY TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL SKILLS AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT. AND UPSKILL- AND ARE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT AT THE DENTURE WITHOUT BEING TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION YOU'RE REALLY GIVING THAT TIME AWAY AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT LEAVING THEIR COWORKERS. I'M WITHOUT ENOUGH RESOURCES AND HELP. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN SECURING THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING AND WE SUPPORT THAT DECISION A WORKFORCE FUNDING TO SUPPORT US SUPPORT REBUILDING THE PUBLIC HEALTH. WORKFORCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CONSTANT BEAT THAT WE ALL TALK ABOUT HIS WORK FORCE AND I THINK WE ALL NEED TO GET WAY MORE CREATIVE IN HOW WE THINK ABOUT. DEVELOPING THAT LATTER AND NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KAREN SAVAGE SWAG. FROM C. FAN. I THINK IT'S A MUCH I'M SURE MANY YOU FOR HAVE ME DANCER. IT'S FROM THE HELP WE CANNOT HELP YOU WORKERS CAN. AND I WANT TO START OUT TO BY THINKING DEPARTMENT ALLEGES. AND ALL OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH LEADERS MY WORKERS FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS WORK DURING A PANDEMIC. OFTEN AT GREAT PERSONAL COST WE OWE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO THE PUBLICSERVANTS. STOOD STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF INCREASING INVESTMENT IN CORE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING THE WORK FORCE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS DATA AND COMMUNICATIONS PLANS PROPOSED BY THE DEPARTMENT WHICH ARE CRUMBLING PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE WAS OST DETRIMENTAL TO HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC. COULD HAVE A LITTLE ABILITY TO INDIVIDUALLY MITIGATE THE STATE'S FAILURE TO PLAN FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND WE MUST CORRECT. WE ALSO THAT STRONG EQUITY PUBLIC HEALTH IF. MUST MULTI. AND MULTI SECTORAL. PUBLIC HEALTH DOES NOT START AND END AT THE DOORS OF GOVERNMENT AND NEITHER DOES RACIAL JUSTICE. IN FACT IN ORDER TO BUILD AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WE MUST HAVE SHARED OWNERSHIP SHARE LEADERSHIP AND SHARED ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CHANGE. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR THOSE WHOSE MISSION IT IS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A STARKLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES. MUST BE PART OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. WELL THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SPENDING PLAN CONTAINS MANY CRITICAL INVESTMENT. IT FALL SHORT IN QUALIFIED IMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP. THIS SECTION CONTAINS NO SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS INSTEAD MERELY PROPOSES TO CREATE ANOTHER PLAN ALONG WITH A FEW ADDED STAFF POSITIONS. IN OUR VIEW THAT FAILS TO MEET THE MOMENT AND SHORT KNOWLEDGE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE THAT COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THAT PLAYED IN BRINGING US TO A TIME WHEN WE CAN EMBRACE. THE SECRETARY PUT IT YESTERDAY A SLOW GLIDE TO NORMAL. WE BELIEVE THAT AN INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE FINE CAN BUILD ITS MAJOR GAP IN THE STATE'S PLAN. HEALTHEQUITY IN RACIAL JUSTICE FUND WOULD GIVE THE STATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE CRITICAL WORK OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE WHAT WORKS USING. BEST PRACTICES AND COMMUNITY DEFINED CARD ROLE IN INDIAN PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL FOR DC DISPARITY AND FROM RCIAL JUSTICE. IT MAY BE INVISIBLE BUSINESS THEY BRIDGES THEY CAN TO TRANSFORM. TO ALIGN COMMUNITY PRIORITIES. MAKING THE END AS A VISIBLE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ARISEN OUT OF UNMET NEED OFTEN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MADE INVISIBLE BY OUR SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES. IT IS THEIR SIZE OR LACK OF POLITICAL POWER. FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE PANDEMIC PACIFIC ISLANDERS EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST DEATH RATES OF ANY RACIAL GROUP IT DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE POPULATION AND ITS DISPERSED NATURE TRUCK CALIFORNIA LITTLE WAS READY TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. IN RESPONSE I GOT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZED TO BUILD A STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADVOCATED FOR THEIR NEEDS ARE AND WHAT STATE AND COUNTY EFFORTS STILL ATTENDED TESTING VACCINATION AND PP DISTRIBUTION. PROVIDED CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PROVIDED HOPE DURING A PERIOD. OF ISOLATION FEAR. SECOND I'M BUILDING COMMUNITY BASE ART. ARE IN TO HAVE A FIND ANY WORLD INTERNET BETWEEN THE STRUCTURE OF COPPER AND- OF COMMUNITY. FOR EXAMPLE I DOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES WERE PARTICULARLY DEVASTATED BY THE IMPACT BUT ALSO PARTICULARLY ISOLATED. FROM THE RESOURCES OF GOVERNMENT. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE STARTED ITS GAP ACTING AS TRUSTED MESSENGERS. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M IN A MEETING TO TRANSFORM SYSTEMS TO ALIGN WITH COMMUNITY PRIORITIES. AFTER THE LAST TWO YEARS I THINK IT IS CLEAR TO ALL OF US TO VALUE EQUITY THAT WE CANNOT GO BACK TO WORK WE CAN GET BACK TO NORMAL. INSTEAD WE MUST INNOVATE AND TRANSFORM TO ELIMINATE RACIAL AND OTHER INEQUITIES. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HOLD SYSTEMS ACCOUNTABLE INSURE CAR BECAUSE A PATIENT IN THE MOCK CHRISSY AND DEVELOP NEW AND CREATIVE IDEAS TO SOLVE SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE SOCIETAL PROBLEMS. IT IS THIS ROLE THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT TO THE RACIAL JUSTICE INNOVATION COMPONENT OF THE FINES. WE MUST BE WILLING TO INVEST IN NEW IDEAS AND EXPERIMENTS AND IN COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY TACKLE THE GENERATIONAL IMPACTS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. BY KILLING THESE THREE CRITICAL ROLES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS COMPLEMENT AND EXTEND THE REACH OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS. AND WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER TARGETED INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS AN INSTRUMENTAL COMPONENT OF PUBLIC. HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW GO TO OUR FINAL PRISON TO TODAY. WITH A MATTHEW MARCIN FROM SENIOR VICE. OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME'S MATTHEW MONSON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR PROGRAMS AND POLICY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. FOUNDED IN CALIFORNIA NOW WORKING ACROSS THE GLOBE YOU TRIED DESIGNS AND IMPLEMENTS PROGRAMS THAT ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND HELP BUILD AND STRENGTHEN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDING THE DEDICATED AN ONGOING FUNDING FOR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. IT IS NECESSARY AND LONG OVERDUE AND DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. OUR EXPERIENCE WORKING IN CALIFORNIA MOST RECENTLY IN THE PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT EVERYONE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WE WORK BEST WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER AND WHEN WE ARE FULLY RESOURCE THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE SHOWN THAT CBO'S ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THE LONG TERM PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT JUST A TEMPORARY SOLUTION DURING A CRISIS WE'LL ALL PUBLIC HEALTH THAT IS WHY PH I IS PROUD TO JOIN MISSY PAN AND OVER TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. IN CALLING FOR AN ADDITIONAL STATE INVESTMENT OF A ONGOING FUNDING TO ESTABLISH THE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE FUND. PROVIDING CBO'S FUNDING TO CBO'S CLINICS AND TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY LED SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS RACIAL JUSTICE AND THE. STRUCTURAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. I WANT TO THANK LEGISLATURE. AND PARTICULARLY THIS. FOR PROVIDING YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE FUND IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. BECAUSE IT IS EXPOSED TO NUMEROUS LONG STANDING AND DEEP FRACTURES IN A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM AND IT HIGHLIGHTED CONVEYS OF THE DISPARITIES AMONG COMMUNITIES. THE DEDICATED RESOURCES PROVIDED THROUGH THE FUND WILL TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES HEAD ON. THE GROUND FUNDS WILL BUILD POWER IN CBO'S SO THEY CAN IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE MOST PRESSING HEALTH INEQUITIES AND RACIAL INJUSTICE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES CAUSED BY THE STRUCTURAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. FROM HOUSING DRINKING WATER FOOD SYSTEMS THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT TO POLICING AND PUBLIC SAFETY TO PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL DECISION MAKING. THE WAY WE DO THAT IS BY FUNDING COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY AND TRUSTING THEIR EXPERTISE. CBO'S HAVE A DEEP AND UNIQUE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH INEQUITIES AND RACIAL INJUSTICE NECK COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE BEST SUITED TO TAILOR EFFECTIVE. CULTURALLY LINGUISTICALLY CENTERED SOLUTIONS TO LOCAL CONCERNS. THEY'RE ALREADY A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE ONE THAT LOOKS. AND SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF THE COMMUNITIES IT SERVES. THEY'RE ALSO A VALUABLE SOURCE FOR THE PIPELINE INTO GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WAS NOTED EARLIER TODAY. CEOS NEED TO BE VALUED AS EXPERTS ENTRUSTED AND EMPOWERED WITH THE RESOURCES TO MAKE CHANGE. ALONG WITH THE PARTNERSHIPS AND INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT TO MAKE THEM A SUCCESS. WHEN WE STEP BACK AND LET THEM LEAD COMMUNITIES DO BETTER. AND WE HAVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. I WANT TO BRIEFLY SPEAK TO THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN TODAY'S AGENDA REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- THAT WOULD REQUIRE A NONPROFIT COMMUNITY HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE SPECIFICALLY AT HOW COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVED FUNDING. LIKE MANY STAKEHOLDERS WE WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN OF THE PROPOSAL. P. H. I. DOES HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND DR KEVIN BARNETT A PH I. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR IS ONE OF THE NATION'S FOREMOST COMMUNITY BENEFIT POLICY EXPERTS. GIVEN A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF QUALIFIED SPENDING OF APPROXIMATELY SEVEN TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. APPLICATION OF THIS REQUIREMENT COULD DOUBLE CURRENT HOSPITAL EXPENDITURES FOCUSING ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. FLOWING IN COMMUNITIES. THIS PROPOSAL MERITS CLOSE ANALYSIS AND PARTNERSHIP WITH NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND CBO'S TO CONSIDER THE OPPORTUNITIES BUT CHALLENGES OBSTACLES AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE PREPARED A POLICY BRIEF WE ARE RELEASING TODAY SUMMARIZES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROPOSED CHANGE IT INCLUDES A SHORT OVERVIEW OF RELEVANT COMMUNITY BENEFIT HISTORY AND ALSO AT THE ADDRESS IS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BUT PLEASED TO PROVIDE A COPY TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO OFFER ANY ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS YOU CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL. IMPORTANTLY WHILE MANY COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS IN AREAS SERVED BY NON PROFIT HOSPITALS DO YOU CURRENTLY RECEIVE FUNDING THROUGH COMMUNITY BENEFIT. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH ACCESS THE FUNDS WOULD BE PRIORITIZED IF THIS PROPOSAL WERE IMPLEMENTED. IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR WHO WOULD DECIDE WHAT ISSUES WOULD BE ADDRESSED OR HOW TO ADDRESS THEM SPECIFIC PROVISION THAT WOULD ALIGN THOSE FUNDS EXPLICITLY WITH THE GOAL OF ADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY PROMOTING RACIAL JUSTICE ALL OTHER STATEWIDE PRIORITIES. CBO'S ARE THE VANGUARD OF RACIAL JUSTICE ACTION STEPPING OUT QUICKLY AND COURAGEOUSLY WELL OUR SYSTEMS AND INSTITUTIONS LIKE BEHIND. WHAT THIS KIND OF FUNDING HELP OR HINDER THEM IN TAKING BOLD DECISIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUES THAT MAY NOT BE POLITICS OR POPULAR. IMPORTANTLY MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE BOTH RURAL AND URBAN ARE NOT SAVED BY A NONPROFIT HOSPITALS. AND WOULD NOT LIKELY BE ABLE TO ACCESS FUNDS AT ALL. FINALLY THE COMPLEX LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS GUIDING COMMUNITY BENEFIT WOULD MEAN THE FUNDS WOULDN'T SHIFT AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE FOR CONSIDERABLE TIME. IF NOT YEARS. COMMUNITIES NEED ACTION NOW IT IS NOT AN EITHER OR BUT OF BOTH AND CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD BY ESTABLISHING THE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE FUND. WE COME TO COMMUNITIES FOR THEIR EXPERTISE WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM TO SOLVE. ALL TOO OFTEN WHEN SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES HAVE ONCE AGAIN FAILED THEM. WE NOW NEED TO COME TO THEM WHEN THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY AS WELL. GIVEN THE CHANCE CBO'S WILL RISE AND MEET THE MOMENT WE NEED TO TRUST IN THEM BUILDER POWER PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RESOURCES AND LIFT UP THE VOICES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY P. I AND OUR COALITION IN SUPPORTING THE HEALTH EQUITY IN RACIAL JUSTICE FUND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE LEGISLATURE AS THE BUDGET PROCESS MOVES FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE INCLUSION OF THE FUND. AS AN INTEGRATED COMPONENT ALONGSIDE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. IN THE FINAL BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION ITSELF LIKE EVERYBODY AS IT. I THINK AS WE'VE ALL SAID MORE TELL US WHAT WE WHAT YOU NEED. AND HOW YOU INTEND TO SPEND IT BECAUSE WE ALL RECOGNIZE. THESE PARTNERSHIPS THAT NEED TO OCCUR AND THE FUNDING THAT NEEDS TO GO OUT- AND I WOULD CONCUR WITH- OUR LAST PANELIST WHEN I. WHEN I READ THIS AGENDA ITEM I THOUGHT WELL THIS IS PAUL SCHEER ISN'T THAT MEMBERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PASS POLICY ON FOR YEARS AND- ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMS TO BE RIGHT HERE SO. I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. AND WE THINK THE PANELIST FOR THEIR INPUT CLICK TO PRINT. I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE PANEL'S PRESENTATION- WHO I GUESS IS THE QUESTION FOR- ACTUALLY FIRST OF ALL- QUESTION FOR- WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS NOW. CDPH BUT ALSO FOR- CALIFORNIA CAN'T WAIT COALITION SO- TO HELP THE- HELP DEPARTMENT SEND THE SEIU. SO YOU'LL JUST ACTUALLY JUST LAST SUMMER- CC DID A LARGE STUDY. AND THEY FOUND THAT OVER HALF OF PEOPLE WORKING IN PUBLIC HEALTH- TACTICS BERRIEN SYMPTOMS AT LEAST ONE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. AND THAT PTSD T. WAS ACTUALLY 10220% HIGHER IN PUBLIC-HEALTH WORKERS THAN THEY WERE FOR FRONTLINE HEALTH WORKERS THE ONES ON THE FRONT LINES IN THE E. R. IN THE ICY USE. WATCHING PEOPLE DIE- SO WHEN HE COMES SO AGAIN REALLY AND WE TALK ABOUT PIPELINE AND SO FORTH- IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSALS THEY'RE BEING PUT FORTH- AND AGAIN I FEEL IN TERMS OF STABILIZING THE WORKFORCE BEYOND THE STUFF THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED AND I KNOW THAT- VIA CALIFORNIA WE COALITION HAS AN ADDITIONAL- WORK FOR STABILIZATION PROPOSALS CAN YOU SPEAK TO AND I KNOW HE DIDN'T DELVE INTO THE DETAILS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING OUR EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS GIVEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM. AND BEING SURE THAT- WE CAN BT- SO COULD YOU SUPPORT THEM AND HAVE THEM CONTINUE TO DO THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF IT WE LOSE WE CAN BUILD THE PIPELINE BUT WE'RE GONNA LOSE MORE PEOPLE OR BRING IN WE'RE GONNA BE FALLING BEHIND STUDENTS FROM THE CITY A- THANK YOU HIS PERSPECTIVE AND THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THIS TOPIC. YEAH THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC. THAT I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU MENTIONED IS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORK FORCE HAS BEEN TRAUMATIZED. SHE AND A GOOD PROPORTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE COMES FROM COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY- COVERED COVERED NINETEEN. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING HERE AT CPA M. WHAT WE YOU KNOW AND OUR OUR PLAN IS TO WORK WITH LOCAL TO REALLY. MAKE THIS TRUE FOR ALL OF ALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON BECOMING A TRAUMA REFORM INFORMED AND TRAUMA RESPONSE ORGANIZATION. AND BRINGING IN TRAINING TO REALLY. MAKE EVERYBODY AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAUMA HOW HOW IT HOW IT AFFECTS US INDIVIDUALLY AND IN IN THE WORK SETTING. AND PART OF THE PART THE IMPORTANT MESSAGE IS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITIES AND THEIR HEALING AND TRAUMA. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DO OUR HEALING. OURSELVES YOU CAN'T BE HEALING ORGANIZATION AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE. THE LATEST ON WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT- TRAUMA AND MENTAL HEALTH AND MAKING A PART OF. THE WORKFORCE EXPERIENCE SO THAT'S THAT'S FROM UP FROM UP FROM A MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE OR BRINGING IN SOME. CONSULTANTS THAT WORK AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WHICH HELPS INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WHAT IS YOUR TOPIC AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THE ISSUE OF. OF CODING AND ITS IMPACT ON HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS. AND THE OTHER THE NEXT THE NEXT- SO TO OTHER COMPONENTS ONE IS WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN REORGANIZE HOW WE DO OPERATIONS. SO THAT WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE MORE BALANCE GIVE PEOPLE TIME GIVE PEOPLE TIME OFF IT IS BECOMING MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND HOW WE DO THE ESSENCE CAN MAIL SYSTEM AND DISASTER RESPONSE. AND BECOMING AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE SO PEOPLE CAN ROTATE OFF AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TIME TO REST AND TO CATCH UP INTO K. AND TO CATCH THEIR BREATH. AND THEN THE LAST COMPONENT IS REALLY- IT'S GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD WITH LOCAL LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE WORKING WITH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST HELP PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN. IMPACTED A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONGER TERM PARTNERSHIPS- OKAY AND SO YEAH WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING IN THAT AREA I WOULD GO AHEAD AND ANSWER BECAUSE I'M SURE. THERE'S OTHERS DON'T WANT TO COMMENT AS WELL. YES THANK YOU PAN THAT CAR. I JUST JUMP ON BEHALF THE COLOR AGAINST GIVEN TO GEAC. AND WE CAN'T UNDER. THE IMPACT THAT SOME OF THE- DURING THE PANDEMIC HAD ON OUR OUR LOCAL HEALTH LEADERS AND WORKFORCE. AT JUST TO GIVE YOU A ROUGH NUMBER. SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WE'VE LOST OVER SIXTY A LOCAL HEALTH LEADERS A LOT DEPARTMENT LEADERS THAT INCLUDES HEATH OFFICERS AGENCY DIRECTORS PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS- THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE SKILL. THOSE ARE THE MENTORS THAT HELP WITH SUCCESSION PLANNING AS WELL SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT AND DEEP LOSS IN LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT ALSO HAS THE IMPACT OF DETERRING. FOLKS FROM WANTING TO COME INTO GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALSO DETERS THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO. WERE IN THE PIPELINE AND KIND OF WORKING THEIR WAY UP AND HOPING TO BE THE FUTURE LEADERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF NOW SEEN A WHOLE DISK DIFFERENT SIDE. OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND NOT QUITE SURE THAT THEY WANT TO EVEN MOVE INTO THOSE RANKS SO IT IS. DETRIMENTAL AND IT HAS HAD A HUGE IMPACT IN I WILL SAY JUST KNOWING THAT I'VE HAD CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE HEALTH OFFICERS IN WITH THAT PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS. THAT THEY GIVE THEIR LIVES TO THIS WORK YOU KNOW THEY DO THIS IT ADDED THE PURE MISSION OF PUBLIC HEALTH- AND THERE IS THERE IS. FOR THEM I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A MOMENT WHERE. THEY WILL NEED TO UNPACK THE TRAUMA THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THIS THIS PANDEMIC- AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'VE HAD THE TIME TO SLOW DOWN AND DO THAT QUITE YET. WITH THAT SAID THOUGH I DO WANT TO KIND OF REFOCUS THIS BACK ON WHAT IS THAT MEAN FOR OUR WORK FORCE. AGAIN THE FLKS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN MENTOR AND TRAIN OUR NOW DEPARTED IN SO. YOU KNOW OUR CALIFORNIA COALITION IS PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE OF IDEAS THAT WILL HELP WITH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION YOU HAVE- OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT CAN OFFER SIGN ON BONUSES- LONGEVITY BONUSES CAN OFFER. A LOAN REPAYMENT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE TOOLS AT OUR AT OUR FINGERTIPS AND PUBLIC HEALTH SO WE'VE BEEN ASKING. FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION TO HELP WITH RAT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STATEMENTS THAT CAN. AND TO REALLY HELP BUILD THE SKILL SET SO THAT. WORKER UP SKILL TRAINING REALLY IS FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUALS IN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT NOW THAT MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL EDUCATION SO ALLOWING THEM THE TIME AND EDUCATION TO PURSUE THAT. SO THAT THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR SKILLS. THE PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH PATHWAYS TRAINING CORPS IS GREAT. AS IS FINALLY MENTIONED THERE'S- IT CALLED FOR A FORTY FIVE I JUST HAVE TO SAY THIS AND I'M SORRY FOR TAKING THE TIME I SPOKE WITH THE COHORT AND ONE INDIVIDUAL SAID. HEY I KNOW I'M A OLDER FACE INTO PUBLIC HEALTH BUT I JUST ANT YOU TO KNOW I'M LOVING WHAT I'M DOING WHICH IS LIKE HEART STRINGS FOR US. THERE WERE OVER NINE HUNDRED APPLICANTS FOR THAT PROGRAM AND SO WE'RE ASKING FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION. TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TWO HUNDRED TRAINEES PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT EXPANDING THE PROGRAM TO ALLOW. IN INTERNSHIPS WITH CSU'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN UC'S TO TRY TO HELP WITH THAT HI BRIAN IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT LESS THAN ONE IN FIVE INDIVIDUALS ARE GRADUATES FROM SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY'RE ACTUALLY ENTERING THE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. THAT IS A HUGE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE CHALLENGE SO THESE NEW INNOVATIVE WAYS AND INVESTING IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE NECESSARY WE HAVE OTHER PROGRAMS FOR MICROBIOLOGISTS LAB DIRECTORS EPIDEMIOLOGIST. THESE ARE TRAININGS THERE ACTUALLY ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY ACTUALLY HAVE GREAT OUTCOMES I WAS LOOKING AT SOMEONE THAT CAL EIS TRAINING YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE 78% OF THOSE GRADUATES THAT HAVE DONE THAT HOW EIS FELLOWSHIP THE EPIDEMIOLOGY FELLOWSHIP. ACTUALLY STATING GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND STATE THE SCENE IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL SO WE'RE LOOKING TO HELP OFFSET THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE HAVING BY A DEPARTING. A WORKFORCE AND LEADERSHIP BY INVESTING MORE INTO THAT THE TOOLS. FOR RECRUITMENT IN RITUALS FOR TRAINING. I MIGHT ADD TO THE COMMENTS I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SEEMS. THIS IS MATTHEW PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE I WANTED TO ECHO WHAT WE WERE THE FIRST ORGANIZATION. ELIAN COVERED WITH- AND SUPPORT WE'RE PROVIDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THE CONTACT TRACING CASE INVESTIGATION. WITH THE FIRST TO PROVIDE. A STUNT TEAMS WITH. A COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL FIRST AID AND TRAUMA ROOM FULL OF SUPPORT BOTH FOR THEIR OWN WORK FORCE AS WELL AS FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEY WERE SERVING A WE WERE HIRING PEOPLE FROM THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THOSE ARE IMPACTED BY COAL BUT- I'M ALSO REALLY PLEASED TO SHARE- THAT- WITH THRILLED TO BE PARTNERING. WITH THE SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO LAUNCH. A NEW CALIFORNIA ACADEMIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROGRAM. THAT WILL BE BUILDING A PATHWAY TO DIVERSE PUBLIC HEALTH GRADUATES AND FACULTY. IN LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THESE WE HAVE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ACROSS. ACROSS THE STATE WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS INITIATIVE I'M PONDERING WITH JACK AND OTHERS IN THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS REALLY EXCITING. BUT I WILL KNOW IT IS FUNDED BY THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE THE RESOURCES TO LAUNCH THAT PROGRAM. IN THIS IN IN THIS FIRST PHASE. AND MANAGED FROM A U. N. REMARKS. ON THIS I WAS JUST A LINE- MY COMMENT SWITH MY COLLEAGUE THE ACCOUNTS CAN'T WAKE CHANGE SHARE THE RE IMPORT AND PIANO KNOW YOUR WAY OF THIS MENTOR. IN A WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AND LOSING STAFF REALLY AT A LOCAL LEVELS YOU KNOW IT'S THAT SORT OF BRAIN DRAIN BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THAT- WILL HELP YOU KNOW HELP YOU GET THROUGH CRISIS HELP YOU GET THROUGH. THE CARE AND SO JUST THAT THAT FURTHER DOUBLE DOWN ON THE NEED TO REALLY BOTH PRIME THE PIPELINE BUT THEN ALSO ENSURE THAT THIS FUNDING- THAT DIGITAL FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S PRPOSAL COMES IN SO THAT YOU CAN- YOU KNOW HOW DID YOU SPELL STOP IT ETAIN STAFF AS WELL- SO WE HAVE THAT MENTORSHIP WHICH ISN'T REALLY PROVEN MODEL AND- THAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SPACE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER COMMENTS ON MAKER AND THAT THERE'S BEEN- APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL FOR. CAN BE BETTER FINE- YEAH I DO THEY SHARED CONCERNS I IT'S A BIT PROBLEMATIC. THIS IS POINTED OUT. THREE PEOPLE WITH IT'S NOT THE COMPANY LAND. FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WEATHER SERVICE AREAS ALL THE HOSPITALS AND WHAT TYPE AND THE LEVELS CAN BE BENEFITS THE CURRENTLY PROVIDE- BECAUSE- BUT MY GUESS. ALTHOUGH AGAIN I ALWAYS APPRECIATE DATA. IS THAT HOSPITALS IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES PROBABLY ALREADY- HAVE FEWER RESOURCES- THEY TEND TO HAVE THE- MORE MEDIC TELL US- COMMERCIAL INSURANCE WE PAY A FEW RESOURCES AND THEREFORE BE MIGHT DO. A PROPORTIONAL S. COMMUNITIES OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A LOCAL HOSPITAL WITH THE ABOUT LOVE A RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO THEN YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA SAY 25% WELL HOW'S THAT DISTRIBUTED ACROSS OUR STATE RIGHT WHERE WHERE THERE'S A SIDE FROM THE OTHER MECHANICAL ILLEGAL ISSUES AND SO FORTH ABOUT. HOW YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN DIRECT THE MONEY ETCETERA. JUST EEN TO DISTURB YOU KNOW WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY SITTING RIGHT NOW ALREADY DISTRIBUTED IN A WAY SINCE YOU'RE DEPENDING ON HOSPITALS- IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE NEED- AS WELL AND- AND SO. I THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING AND- NOT SURE THAT'S REALLY THE MIGHT BREAK MECHANISM BUT- CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE IF THAT'S TO CONTINUE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE THATMUCH MORE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HOW DO YOU SURE. WE MEET THOSE COLORS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IN TERMS OF EQUITY AND SO FORTH AND HOW THOSE RESOURCES DISTRIBUTED- BEFORE WE'D ENTERED YEAH SEARCH ENTERTAIN- ADOPTING THAT GUESS ONE LAST QUESTION IS THAT. IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY OUT REACH AND WE TALKED YOU KNOW EVERY P. C. C. TEN AND C. H. I TALK ABOUT THE COMING OUT RIGHT. NOW WE DEVELOPED A MODEL FOR THE CENSUS. I MEAN IT WAS A SORT OF BIG CAMPAIGN WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE THOUGHT SENSES ND SO FORTH AND I KNOW SOME OF THE FOLKS I BELIEVE WHO WORKED ON THAT ARE EACH ARE NOW WORKING WITH CPS THAT C. P. H. ON SOME OF THE OUTRAGE. THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT POTENTIALLY- THE MODEL THAT THEY HOPE WILL THE LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM THAT WAS IT IT DID THREE IT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THAT AND TERMS OF OUR APPROACH FOR. AN ONGOING EFFORT TO STAY IN PUBLIC HEALTH- TO BUILD THOSE- COMMUTER RELATIONSHIPS AND- AND MESSAGING. YEAH LET ME ASK ASSISTANCE IN LA TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN WORKING ON A VACCINE AREA WHERE THAT. SPEND IT. IN A PART APART. OF OUR VACCINE AFTER. YEAH I'M SORRY THINK WE WERE A LOT A LOT THROUGH THAT THOSE PART WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CD ACROSS THE STATE THAT THERE ARE A CRITICAL PART IN OUR BACK STRATEGY IN TERMS NOT ONLY BRINGING THE RESOURCE TO COME BY DR THE DEMAND AND HELP TO ANSWER ADDRESS. THAT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL- WE DEFINITELY SEE THE PARTNERS SO CBO A CRITICAL TO IMPROVING HEALTH I THINK YOU ARE ON WORK ON THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT IS CERTAINLY CERTAINLY A PARTIALLY AN ANSWER I THINK THAT IT DOES BRING SOME RESOURCES IT WON'T BRING IT EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THIS WON'T REACH EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF WHERE THE HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED. THERE ARE SOME TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THOSE WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH THAT WORD DRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES BROUGHT UP BY NOT ONLY THE HOSPITALS BUT BY SOME OF THE CBO'S IN TERMS OF HOW WE MIGHT MAKE THIS WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS AND WE'VE WE'VE DONE SOME MASTER MASTER H. GUY OF WHAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT COULD LOOK LIKE THEY'RE ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS SPENT ON COMMUNICATING ON. THE BENEFIT NOW OF THAT ABOUT FOUR BILLION OF IT IS ON UNCOMPENSATED CARE SO WE WOULDN'T BE TOUCHING THAT MONEY BUT 25% OF THE REST OF THE MONEY IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THE REACH OF THAT WHAT THIS MONEY GETS SPENT ON SO WE'RE TRYING TO CLARIFY AND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT WOULD HELP US TO REALLY DRIVE COLLECTIVE IMPACT AND- FOCUS ON EQUITY AND SOME OF THE ISSUES WHERE WE DO WANT TO SEE THESE INVESTMENTS GO. AND YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO GET THESE IN PLACE AND TO MOVE THE DIAL BETWEEN WHERE THEY'RE INVESTED NOW AND HOW WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THAT I THINK WE'RE ALSO DRIVING TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY IN THE REPORTING AND HOW THIS INFORMATION GETS REPORT IT- SOME MORE WORK TO COME WILL BE SHARING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- AS WE FLUSH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND- COMMUNITY OUT OF IT. YOUR COMMUNITY BASED. ORGANIZATIONS IN IMPROVING PUBLIC I'LL- ACROSS THE STATE AND I THINK P. H. I. AMAZING AND- OF. CONTACT RACER AND WORK WITH OUR LAW JURIST. AND SHOWING DIFFERENTLY AND THEN IN OUR VACCINE STRATEGIES. THAT WORK ACROSS COMMUNICATIONS AND THEN WITH OUR CBO'S TO REALLY PUT RESOURCES PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS WHERE. WE WERE NOT SEEING THE MOST IMPACT ON THE LEAST RESOURCES SO THAT WE SAW. THAT TESTING WHERE WE PLACED OUR TESTING SITES WHERE WE PLACED OUR VACCINE CLINICS AND MOBILE RESOURCE SAYS. AND THEN PARTNERING THAT SO NOT ONLY WOULD WE CREATE THE EVENT. BUT WE WOULD HAVE C. B. I WAS ON THE GROUND THAT COULD. PROVIDE TRANSLATION SERVICES GET PEOPLE TO COME TO THOSE EVENTS. AND THE ANSWER AND ADDRESS EDUCATION QUESTIONS- THAT REALLY HELP TO GET US. WHERE WE NEEDED TO BE AND SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES SO. MORE TO COME ON THIS. IF I MAKE ON THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE FACT THAT THAT REGION THAT TYPE OF. COMMUNITY BASED CAMPAIGNS THINK WE DO SEE THAT. AS A REALLY EFFECTIVE MODEL AND ONE THAT THE STATE DID YOU REPLICATE WHEN IT CAME TO DOING OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. AROUND HOPING PARTICULARLY WHEN WE WERE ROLLING OUT SCENES IN TRYING TO PARTICULARLY TARGET. COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST NEED BUT I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBING FOR MANY YEARS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. WHICH IS THAT WE DON'T INVEST UNTIL WE HAVE A REALLY SPECIFIC NEED AND CRISIS AND SO WE DON'T BUILD THAT LONG TERM CAPACITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT ON SOME OF THESE IMPACTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. EXCELLENT POINT THANK YOU. A IS THAT AT THE IS NOT TO A DRIVER. YOU COMMENTS COMMUNITY. FROM THE- REPORT WE'RE RELEASING TODAY THE BRIEF. BEGINS TO ADDRESS EXACTLY THOSE ISSUES BUT BUT MORE DISCUSSION NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THE HOSPITALS- AND ALSO WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN PARTICULAR AROUND FOR EXAMPLE THE IRS APPROVED CATEGORIES FOR COMMUNITY BENEFIT. AND THEN HAT ACTION CAN BE TAKEN TO THE STATE OR THE LOCAL LEVEL AND TO SUPPORT SOME OF THAT. INCREASE SPENDING UPSTREAM AND- STRUCTURAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SO WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL. THAT'S A LOOK AT THAT MORE CLOSELY THANK YOU AND WE SET THE RECORD I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU. AND SO MUCH FOR. HERE WE HEAR YOU'RE WORKING ON THE AND YOU HEAR WERE LITTLE SKEPTICAL SO- OKAY WE THANK OUR PANEL VERY MUCH- AND JUST JUST BRIDGES ONE NOTE AS I AS WE'VE ALL NOTED TO WORK FORCE IS AN ISSUE AND WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF THE SENIORS- THOSE MIGHT BE SOME FOLKS THAT WE CAN GO BACK AROUND TO ALSO AFTER THEY HAVE A LITTLE BREAK AND SEE IF THEY WANT TO COME BACK IN FOR SUPERVISION. MENTORSHIP SOME OF THOSE MAYBE NON NIKON CONTACT AREAS OF WORKING BUT THAT'S UP TO A HUGE RESOURCE THAT IS STILL OUT THERE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE INVITED BACK A PERHAPS MORE AT A SUPERVISOR LEVEL OR- FOR PROVIDING INPUT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE. NUMBER THREE. GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS JAMES WHITE AND I'M AN ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. FIND SOME BRIEF PROGRAMMATIC CONTEXT FOR THE PROPOSAL AND THEN I'LL HAND OFF TO THE RIGHT GERMAN SHELL WITH OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES DIVISION. SO PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC S. T. E. PH HAD INFECTIOUS DISEASE- INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT WERE SUFFICIENT FOR ROUTINE ACTIVITIES BUT THEY WERE LIMITED IN FUNCTIONALITY. DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES AND THE SYSTEMS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. THE DISEASE REPORTING SYSTEM WAS QUICKLY OVERWHELMED BY THE VOLUME OF DATA BEING REPORTED ON ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COMMENT NINETEEN TESTS. WE WENT FROM AN AVERAGE OF FEWER THAN TEN THOUSAND INCOMING MESSAGES PER DAY TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE HAD UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY. IN RESPONSE WE SET UP A NEW SYSTEM FOR RECEIVING LABORATORY DATA. AND IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE ANALYZE AND REPORT LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA QUICKLY AND CONSISTENTLY. WE DID NOT HAVE FLEXIBLE TOOLS TO SUPPORT CASE INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING. WE SET UP A NEW STATEWIDE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS TO MOVE DATA BETWEEN SYSTEMS. WE COULD NOT SEND AUTOMATED COMMUNICATIONS TO PERSONS INFECTED WITH ARE EXPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN. IMPLEMENTING TOOLS TO SEND AUTOMATED MESSAGES HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN TIMES IN CASE COUNTS HAVE BEEN VERY HIGH. WE ALSO NEEDED NEW TOOLS TO SUPPORT CODE NINETEEN VACCINATION EFFORTS THAT WERE NOT NEEDED BEFORE THE ENDEMIC SO WE IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL NEW TOOLS INCLUDING A TOOL FOR PEOPLE TO DETERMINE THEIR VACCINE ELIGIBILITY FIND A VACCINATION SITE AND SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT INVENTORY MANAGEMENT FOR VACCINE PROVIDERS. NEW TOOLS TO SUPPORT VACCINE ALLOCATIONS IN ORDER MANAGEMENT FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN A SYSTEM FOR THE PUBLIC TO OBTAIN VACCINE VERIFICATION. AND FINALLY. WE ENHANCED THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY. TO MANAGE THE GREATLY INCREASED DATA VOLUME AND COMMUNICATE WITH HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. DURING THE PANDEMIC THE NUMBER OF DOSES RECORDED HAS DOUBLED. THE NUMBER OF QUERIES TO THE SYSTEM FOR VACCINE RECORDS HAS INCREASED FIVE FOLD. SO WE HAVE ENHANCED OUR SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT INCREASED DATA VOLUME. JOHN OVER TO YOU KNOW THANK YOU JAMES. SO CHENEY PH HAS LEVERAGE FEDERAL STATE FUNDING AND BEST EGG HOW TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA SYSTEMS CREATED AND MODIFIED DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE ADOPTED OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY TO WORK WITH NEW MODERN ARCHITECTURES PROVIDING SHE COMPONENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO RESPOND OVER NINETEEN. AND THE URGENT NEED FOR ENHANCED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS. ITS TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR CD PH AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO EFFECTIVELY TRACK GATHER AT TRACKING GATHER DATA ON CODE NINETEEN AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. PERFORM CONTACT TRACING TO MINIMIZE DISEASE SPREAD. OFFICIALLY ADMINISTER LIFE SAVING VACCINES RAPIDLY PERFORM COVER NINETEEN TEST AND DEPLOY PERSONNEL IN AREAS OF PANDEMIC RESPONSE. THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES DIVISION AND THE CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES REQUEST A HUNDRED THIRTY POSITIONS. FORTY FOR A FOR I. T. AND SEVENTY FIVE PER PROGRAM AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED FORTY POSITIONS AND A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED FORTY POSITIONS AND SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THESE POSITIONS ARE FUNDING FOR QUESTIONS ARE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THE CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS SUPPORT. NECESSARY PANDEMIC SERVICES STATEWIDE. FAIR FOR AND RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES ON A LARGE SCALE DISASTERS. AND BUILD CDPH OPERATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGY RESILIENCY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. DOES NOT. HELLO HEY THIS IS SONYA PADDOCK AGAIN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND AS WE NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE WE DO THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR CD CAGE HAVE AN OVER ARCHING IT STRATEGY FOR ALL PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND C. H. DID INDICATE TO OUR OFFICE THAT IT WILL BE DEVELOPING SUCH A STRATEGY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE NEW- CHIEF IT STRATEGIST THE DEPARTMENT ALSO NOTED TO OUR OFFICE THAT IT'S IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A HOLISTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE DISEASE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEM SPECIFICALLY. IN THE MEANTIME WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE PATICULAR SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL FOR KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE AND FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE SURVEILLANCE OVERALL AND WE THINK IT SEEMS REASONABLE. TO BRING SOME OF THE MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS OF THE SYSTEM'S IN HOUSE SO THAT CDPH HAS GREATER- VISIBILITY INTO EACH F THE SYSTEMS AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE. CHANGES AS NEEDED SO- WE ARE NOT RAISING ANY PARTICULAR- ISSUES WITH THIS REQUEST WE RECOGNIZE IT'S A IT'S A LARGE DOCUMENTATION FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF THESE IT SYSTEMS BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY PLAY AT A VERY CRITICAL ROLE AT THE MOMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WANT THE DEPARTMENT CAN SPEAK TO THE LACK OF THE OVER ARCHING GOAL AND THEN- HOW HOW THIS FITS IN WITH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ABOUT. WORK FORCE AND BRING IN ALL THESE PEOPLE ON HOW DOES IT HOW DOES IT FIT INTO THE OVER ARCHING IT GOAL AND HOW HOW DO WE INTEGRATE THEIR WORKFORCE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION INTO THIS. COMPONENT AS WELL. AND I CAN SPEAK TO THE OVER ARCHING IG GOAL SO- AS YOU MENTIONED WE ARE DOING A MULTIPLE ASSESSMENTS RIGHT NOW OF OUR ECOSYSTEM AND OUR SYSTEMS TO DETERMINE WHERE WE NEED TO PLACE EMPHASIS ON THAT OVER ARCHING STRATEGY IT'S A FOUNDATIONAL WORK THAT'S BEING DONE- WE SEE FUTURE STRATEGY BEING CREATED. YOU KNOW- AS WE FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY WHAT SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES NEED TO BE MAINTAINED CONSOLIDATED OUR OUR RE FACTORS. AND AS WE BRING THOSE THINGS IN HOUSE DO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT OR SINCE WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH SUCH A WORK FORCE ISSUE RIGHT NOW. DOES IT IT DOES THIS IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO BE ABLE TO BRING ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS TOGETHER. YES SO OUR PLAN IS TO BRING THEM IN HOUSE AND GAIN THE SKILLS AND STRATEGIES. OUR SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN AND SUPPORT THEM. WE'RE GOING TO LEVERAGE OUR CONTRACTORS. GOING FORWARD. TO BE ABLE O WORK WITH STATE STAFF. TO DO THAT KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER- WE C. I. A. A. ROLE ON STRATEGY OR WORK FORCE- COMING OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS PLUS. TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND BRING THOSE THINGS IN HOUSE AND THEN GAIN THAT'S US SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES TO MAINTAIN AND SUPPORT THEM. I'M AS FAMILIAR A FEEL I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD FINISH COMPLETE I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IT IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TERMSTRATEGY THAT WOULD BE A ONE TO THREE YEAR STRATEGY TO. BRING THOSE IN HOUSE OR LOOK AT. JUST A STAIN ABILITY TO EVEN SEE IF THEIR BIBLE TO BRING IT OUT. I MISS FAILURE YOU'RE GONNA BE YOU'RE GONNA WORK ALL ALL OF YOUR- YOU WORK FIRST DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. INTO THIS COMPONENT AS WELL. ABSOLUTELY. THIRTY PM. THANK YOU AND- EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT IT INVOLVES A LOT OF MONEY SO I DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS- AND- SO FIRST OF ALL JUST TO CLARIFY SO APPRECIATE YOU SAID YOU CAN BRING THE THINGS IN HOUSE- WHAT I SEE HERE IS YOU'RE ASKING FOR ANY OF THE FUNDING ESSENTIALLY A HUNDRED FORTY POSITIONS ON ON GOING BASIS BECAUSE YOUR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AND THIRTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION AND THEN A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX IN THE SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION THERE AFTER SO. IS THE SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ESSENTIALLY TO PAY FOR THE HUNDRED FORTY POSITIONS. I'M SORRY YES I BELIEVE SO. OKAY SO THE REMAINING OF THE MONEY SO OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST US OF A TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POINT TWO SO THE SO WHAT'S THE REST OF THE MONEY FOR IS IT. TO SO THAT IS TO. MAINTAIN THE LICENSING- D. STRUCTURES THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPLICATIONS THAT WE START UP CURRENTLY. THERE ARE SOME RESIDUAL COSTS AROUND THOSE AND ONGOING COSTS THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN. OKAY SO THOSE LICENSING COSTS WOULD GO AWAY AFTER THIS THIS FIRST YEAR OURS IT AT THE COST OF PURCHASING AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND LIKE SO THAT YOU KNOW. THAT THAT SO YEAH I KNOW THIS WOULD GO AWAY AND I CAN GET YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THAT- IN MORE DETAIL IF YOU'D LIKE OKAY FINE SO IT'S I DO YEAH. I GUESS WHY WHY UNDERSTANDS HIM WHO'S GOING FOR TWO AND- TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE AND IT GOES DOWN TO SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT. WHAT'S GOING FOR WHAT SO SOME OF IT'S OUR POSITIONS SOME OF ITS FOR WHATEVER AND- WHY IT IS TEMPORARY VERSES YOU KNOW. THAT NIGHT I'M GOING SO. THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE AND BEGIN THIS IS. THIS THIS IS MY- FORTUNATELY- EXPERIENCE WITH IT PROJECTS IS THAT. SO FOR THESE SYSTEMS AND I. YOU KNOW I HEAR A LOT OF THE OLD MAINTENANCE AND SO FORTH- AND IN FACT- ENFORCE WE HAVE TOLENTINO THE TECHNOLOGY FOLKS HERE. BUT R. D. AND I KNOW WE STILL THESE UP PRETTY QUICKLY FOR THE FOR THE PANDEMIC. BUT ON A MORE ON GOING BASIS RD. FOR EXAMPLE ALREADY BUILT AS A MODULAR SYSTEM SO IT'S HARDLY MADE SO IT DECIDE FROM THE MAINTENANCE PART LIKE KEEP IT RUNNING. WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO KEEP SYSTEMS UPGRADED RIGHT SO THEY'RE GOING TO INTERFACE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS. THERE'S OTHER YOU KNOW WHETHER IN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OR OTHER PLACES AND THOSE SYSTEMS WILL UPGRADE RATE THAT OPERATING SYSTEMS UPGRADE YET WINDOWS GET THIS FROM TEN TO ELEVEN. BACK IOS GOES FROM I ONLY GO TO HIGH SIERRA TO YOU KNOW LET THIRD OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW IF I GOT WRONG. YOU KNOW THE MAC AT HOME. SO SO WE SO WE NOT ONLY NEED MAINTENANCE WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT. IT'S MODULAR AND CAN UPGRADE SO THAT WE'RE ALWAYS WITH DOING MY CALL BIG BANG RIGHT LANDS WE- REVIVED BIG SYSTEM WE GET. SOMEONE AND THEN WE PUT IT THERE AND IT SITS THERE AND THEN EACH YEAR IT GETS OLDER AND OLDER OLDER THAN TEN YEARS LATER WE HAVE A SITUATION. WHERE OUR SYSTEM IS REALLY OLD AND IT'S NOT KEEPING UP I MEAN. YOU KNOW WITH. WITH EDT DMV YOU KNOW SO. SO I WANT TO BE SURE TO IT AS WORK. PENDING FUNDING IN. AND WE'RE ABOUT. WERE NOT JUST TALKING ME IN A WE'RE TALKING. ON GOING. UPGRADING BECAUSE IT'S NOT KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM CONSTANT IN- A MONITOR. TO IT SUITS CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE ARE NOT JUST. ALONE THEY HAVE TO INTERFACE THE REST OF THE WORLD RIGHT SO I HOPE THE- THE- LIKE THE BROTHERS OF AXING REGISTRY OR TO NOTIFIER WHATEVER ELSE RATES OF WHAT USED TO BE ON TRACK FAX TECHNOLOGY USED TO BE. A STATE OF THE ART. IT'S NOT ANYMORE RIGHT SO YOU DON'T BE STUCK WITH A SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T. INVOLVE WITH THE THINGS AROUND IT EVEN IF IT WORKS REALLY WELL. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK WELL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T INTERACT WITH OTHER SYSTEMS AROUND BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THAT KIND. COULD HAVE NVOLVED. IN THEIR OWN WAY SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. EAH I KNOW AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU SO UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD TO STAND THESE THINGS UP VERY QUICKLY AND RAPIDLY SO WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO THE STRATEGY ARCHITECTURE AROUND THOSE. TO BUILD THEM THE MOST EFFICIENT AND MODULAR WAY- THAT IS- THE FUTURE STRATEGIES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO WE'RE GOING TO. WE'RE DOING ASSESSMENTS RIGHT NOW ON THE APP FOR SUSTAINABILITY. LOOKING AT HOW WHAT SYSTEMS CAN BE RATIONALIZED COMBINED. WITH SYSTEMS NEED BETTER ARCHITECTURE TO BE MORE MODULAR. AND HOW WE TRANSITION OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CLOUD. AND ALL THE FEATURES OF THAT GOING FORWARD BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THAT'S- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MAIN. PRIORITIES AS WE SEEK A PHOTO SO WHAT'S THE TIME SO AND I UNDERSTAND THE PREVIOUS YOUR PREVIOUS ANSWER THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS THAT WE CAN GET THAT CHIEF IT OFFICER. GOING TO DO THIS THING WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR THAT. SO YOU KNOW. WE WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING IS ASSESSED. TO UNDER. THE AND OF F. AND WHAT WE- HAVE- BEFORE WHICH DETERMINE THE- STRATEGY. HOW LONG IS. IT TAKE IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW BIG. YOU KNOW I GOTTA GET A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS HAVE TO HAPPEN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A TIME LINE FOR THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS SO HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO DO THAT FIRST PART AND THEN YOU CAN BRING AN I. T. PERSON AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SO. I MEAN WE TALKING IN. FULL WELL WE HAVE AN IT STRATEGY IN TWO YEARS THREE YEARS. WHAT'S THAT THAT WHAT WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT- WE SHOULD HAVE- THAT TV TO BE READY TO PRESENT. ITS STRATEGY TO US AND FRANKLY THE REST OF THE WORLD. IS TOO OKAY- THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS THE PATH THIS IS THE PATH THAT WE'VE GOING THROUGH EXTENDED SUCCESS MENTOR CENTER- SO WHAT WHAT IS THAT TIME LINE. I WILL ANTICIPATE IT WOULD TAKE THREE YEARS WE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE MORE AND ADD JOBS. ALREADY JEWS OR STRATEGY UNDERSTAND OUR ECOSYSTEMS AND THEN DEVELOPED- THAT STRATEGY AND THEN IMPLEMENT GOING FORWARD AND THEN JUST TO GET HER DEATH. SO IT'S NOT A ONE TIME STRATEGY. CAN IMPLEMENT IT AND THIS STOP LIKE YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT LEADS TO BIG BANG AT LEAST R. K. SYSTEMS AND OUTDATED SYSTEMS. WE WANT TO CONTINUALLY DO STRATEGY AND CONTINUE REFRESHER SYSTEMS GOING FORWARD. YOU NEED GIVE ME A TIMELINE FOR ITS STRATEGY FOR AT LEAST INITIALLY DOING STRATEGY SO IT. I WOULD I WOULD SAY AT LEAST ONE TO TWO YEARS BEFORE I CAN DO THAT DEPENDING YOU KNOW AND- DON'T QUOTE ME ON IT BUT THAT. THAT'S NORMALLY ABOUT GENERALLY WHAT WE'RE THINKING AND AS TIME. SO IT'S ONLY JUST BECAUSE THIS AND MENTALLY I WON'T BE HERE NEXT YEAR- SO I'M GONNA LOOK AT. CENTER ADMIN AND SOMEONE ELSE WILL PERHAPS HERE TO HEALTH COMMITTEE AND SO FORTH AND ALSO TO LOOK AT ELIAHU IT'S NOT ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW. AND SO I THINK. ANYTIME WE DO A LARGE IT STRATEGY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. WITH AN UPDATE. THAT HAS OF COURSE THE AGENCY THAT'S DOING IT AND THE PART OF TECHNOLOGY AND TALK ABOUT WHERE. YOU KNOW HOW THAT'S COMING TOGETHER. AS AFTER ALL YOU KNOW WE- THAT THE THINGS ARE EX. STATE AND SO FORTH AND- WHAT I PREFERRED TO THAT THAN THE HEARING THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN WHEN WE USED TO GO INTO AGENCY HAS TO COME UP AND TELL US HOW. HOW TO DETER SYSTEM IS AND WHY THERE'S A FAILURE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DON'T THEY CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND THAT THAT UNLIMITED DATA DATA SYSTEMS. SO SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW UP- MAYBE ELLIE- CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT KIND OF MONITORING YOU'LL BE DOING OF THESE I THIS I. T. EFFORT- TO BE SURE THAT- WE ARE. THAT THE LEGISLATURES WILL INFORM TO I MEAN I GET. NOW AND I APPRECIATE NOW THE AGILE AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF. BUT I. THINK IT'S AGAIN IMPORTANT WE MONITOR THIS. SO THAT SAYS THANK YOU FOR ASKING DR PAN- WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS AND WE ALSO HAVE. ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AND IS. SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY LOOKS AT IT PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND MONITORS ALL OF THE- VARIOUS PROJECTS GOING THROUGH THE- DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE- PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE. PROCESS- BUT YEAH YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THAT SOME SPECIFIC THOUGHT AS TO JUST SORT OF HOW WE INTERACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO MONITOR THIS GOING FORWARD BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT'S ON OUR RADAR THAT WILL BE CONTINUING TO ASK ABOUT OKAY SO THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTES HAND AGAIN WOULD DEPRECIATE YOUR YOUR INSIGHTS FROM THE LA- IS THAT SO THE REASON I STARTED OFF POINTING OUT THAT WE'RE GOING FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION ESSENTIALLY DOWN TO SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IS THAT. THAT'S A BUDGET TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT SYSTEMS THAT'S NOT A BUDGET TO SAY WE'RE UPGRADING THE SYSTEMS THAT'S NOT INVITED SAYING HOW WE'RE CONSOLIDATING IT CETERA SO IN OTHER WORDS I'M GONNA SAY THAT THERE IS EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THAT WORD THEY WERE GONNA DO A MULTIPLE YEAR OUT YOU KNOW THAT OUT YEARS WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING THAT ON THE I. T. SIDE FOR CD PH THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE FOR NEW SYSTEMS AFTER A CONSOLIDATION SO FAR THIS IS THE MINIMUM THIS IS THAT MAINTENANCE NOW GET THE CURRENT LICENSES WIND THAT DOWN WE'LL BRING IT IN HOUSE THIS IS THE FIFTH WE NEED TO RUN IT TO KEEP IT GOING. SO I JUST WANT TO PUT A PIN ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT DAN IS WE'RE LOOKING AT BUDGETS FOR C. PH IN THE OUT YEARS THAT'S ONE OF THE COME BACK THEY WILL ACTUALLY TOLD YOU NOW YOU DON'T WE ONLY NEED A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION YES YOU NEED A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION TO MAINTAIN YOUR CURRENT SYSTEM BUT WHAT IS THE BUDGET ASK FOR THE NEW SYSTEMS THE UPGRADE THAT CETERA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING SO THAT THE SYSTEM STAY UP TO DATE. AND SO I DO WANNA BE SURE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT AND REMEMBERING THAT SO EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT BE PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET REQUEST THE TRUE IT BUDGET FOR C. C. PH IS NOT WHAT'S BEING BEFORE US IT'S LARGER THAN. THIS IS AN ACCURATE STATEMENT. YEAH I CAN CAN RESPOND THAT YEAH THIS IS TRUE JUST. TWO MINUTES OPERATE. AND SO. SUSTAINABILITY OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE STOOD UP DURING THE CALL THE CRISIS OKAY. SO IT SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SEE THOUGH IS IN ADDITION TO THIS. ALL RIGHT. AT LEAST YOU RE TOLD ME. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A AND WE ONLY HAVE THAT AND THEN WE HAVE THAT. TINY LITTLE PIECE IN THE LAST ITEM WHICH IS ONLY ABOUT THE BIRTH DEFECT DATABASE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BUDGET ALLOCATION. FOR WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT I. T. PLANNING- RATE- AND I DON'T KNOW YOUR CHIEF DATA OFFICERS ARRAYED BUILT INTO THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION OR NOT BUT I. MEAN WHAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO DO THE RIGHT IT PATH SO GREAT YOU GAVE US A BUDGET FOR MAINTAINING THE EXISTING SYSTEM YET THE STAND UP DURING THE PANDEMIC WILL STILL NEED A PIECE OF ENDEMIC STILL WITH US. IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY- HOPEFULLY WE CAN WIND IT THE OTHER GLIDE PATH THAT THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT BUT- ALSO THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A SOME PLANNING FUND SO THAT. AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND TELL US OKAY NOW THAT WE PLANNED FOR I. T. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED IN ORDER TO. MOVE FORWARD AND BE SURE THAT WE CONTINUALLY HAVE UPDATE SYSTEMS. THAT MAKE SENSE SUCH YOU KNOW WE- WILL DEFINITELY WORK WITH OUR OVERSIGHT AGENCIES. IN CONTROL AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW. GIVE THEM REGULAR UPDATES ON THIS AND FOLLOW THE- PROJECT LIFECYCLE FOR CALIFORNIA. OKAY BUT I I'D LIKE TO SEE A PROPOSAL FOR D. V. I. MAINTENANCE. FOR YOUR PLAN OKAY. WE NEED YOUR TECHNICAL SYSTEMS FOR THAT FINANCE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S IN LINE WITH WHAT. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS. BUT IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT- THAT- I MEAN WHAT WE HEARD FROM C. T. H. IS THAT THEY ALSO NEED TO. KNOW SO WE NEED TO GET THE SUN RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR PANTS AND ALL THE TALK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO BETTER EVALUATE. TO YOUR POINT COSTS FOR UPGRADES AND OR NEW SYSTEMS- WE WOULD JUST REITERATE THAT THE EXISTING BUDGET REQUEST IS TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THE SYSTEMS THAT WERE SET UP DURING KOBE TO- SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. THE BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT'S IT COSTS OKAY THANK YOU SO I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE AND JUST MAINTAIN EXISTING SYSTEMS MAR TWENTY. TWENTY FOUR OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WOULD SAY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS TO THE LA- IT AS WE'VE SEEN TO THE PANDEMIC IT'S NOT WAS NOT JUST THE PUBLIC HEALTH. TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WE STRUGGLED WITH ALL OF OUR STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH EDT- DMV AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO HAS AN INITIAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO OPERATE AS SOME KIND OF I. T. DEVICE. THAT WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH ON THE BACK END. SO BOTH FOR THE LA- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOR THE LA- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S- TWO METRICS YOU CAN YOU CAN WORK ON TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THESE THESE. PROJECTS ASTHEY'RE GOING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT UPDATES AND OR- IMPROVEMENTS ARE BEING MADE TO BE ABLE TO. TO RESPOND TO GOING FORWARD AND NOT JUST LOOKING BACK- OKAY WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. VIRGIN SHE RESPONSE AND BORDER RESPONSE OPERATIONS. THIRTY DR- YES I THINK- I'M IS THIS OKAY BRANDON IS THIS ONE ON THE ON THE ON THE CUT CUT CUT YEAH COMPANY MERCY RESPONSE SORRY OKAY- YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GONNA MAKE SOME OVERLAP I'M GONNA MAKE SOME BRANDON. SO FOR THE COMMON RESPONSE. YOU KNOW I'VE ALREADY COVERED A LOT IN TERMS OF IMPACT OF COVERT RESPONSE IN A WORD NOW APPROACHING OVER EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DEATHS THAT WE'VE HAD ATTRIBUTED TO COME OVER AND WE KNOW THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY HAS A MUCH BIGGER RESPONSE BEYOND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT HAVE DIED I HE MENTIONED ALSO THAT EARLIER ACCESS TO ASK. I DON'T THINK I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT. WITH CULTIVATED THERE REALLY HAS THERE REALLY HAS BEEN A- SHIFT. IN OUR MINDSET OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS PANDEMIC IS PLAYING OUT. I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND ALL OF US CAN GO BACK AND THINK ABOUT EVEN IN JUNE FIFTEENTH. YOU KNOW WHEN WE LIFTED. THE RESTRICTIONS- AND THE BLUEPRINTS TO BLUEPRINT FOR A BETTER ECONOMY WENT AWAY. YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME OPTIMISM THAT YOU NEVER HEARD OF MUTINY WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE VACCINATED. AND THEN OF COURSE- THINGS CHANGE WITH WITH DELTA. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I DO WANT TO POINT OUT WITH DELTA THIS WAS TRUE ALSO FOR THE ALPHA VARIANT. IS THAT. THERE ARE NOT ONLY MORE TRANSMISSIBLE BUT THEY. WERE ALSO MORE VIRULENT. AND- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THIS VIRUS MOVING FORWARD IS THAT BECAUSE MOST TRANSMISSION HAPPENS BEFORE PEOPLE DEVELOP SYMPTOMS. EITHER THEY'RE A SYMPTOMATIC DON'T DEVELOP ANY SYMPTOMS THAT TRANSMIT. OR THEIR PRE SYMPTOMATIC AND CAN TRANSMIT BEFORE THEY DEVELOP SYMPTOMS. IT TURNS OUT FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY. BIOLOGY PERSPECTIVE THAT WE COULD HAVE A BEARING ON THE FUTURE LIKE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT ARE MORE VIRULENT IN OTHER WORDS THE COST BECAUSE MORE DISEASE. AND. AND CAN BE MORE TRANSMISSIBLE. THERE IS A NATIONAL THINKING THAT DELTA WE WOULD NOT SEE IF WE WOULD NOT SEE THINGS MORE TRANSMISSIBLE THAN DELTA AND THEN OVER THANKSGIVING WE LEARNED ABOUT A LOW CRIME. SO OVERCROWDED REALLY MADE US HAVE A REALLY BIG SHOULD SHIFT IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR THINKING IS THAT BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE TRANSMISSION HAPPENING GLOBALLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NEW VARIANTS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHERE WHETHER THAT BUT COMBINATION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN TERMS OF TRANSFER DEFINITELY PROBABLY MORE TRANSMISSIBLE AND MAYBE EVEN MORE VIRULENT. AND SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND READING US SO THAT WE CAN ADAPT TO RESPOND TO WHATEVER WHATEVER COMES AND YOU KNOW THIS IDEA OF US LEARNING AND LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THE VIRUS AND YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR. THE GOVERNOR COVERED THE CORE COMPONENTS- EAT YESTERDAY WHEN THEY CALLED CALIFORNIA SMARTER EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT. A PLAN FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF CALIFORNIA'S COVERT RESPONSE HAVE A COVERS THE CORE AREAS THAT ARE IN IN THE IN THE BUDGET THAT- THE BRAIN IS GONNA IS GONNA SUMMARIZE IN TERMS OF VACCINATIONS. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ESPECIALLY GALE ABILITY OF. MASKING MAKING SURE THAT. GOOD MASTER OF TO HAVE A CALL. YOUR IDEA OF SIR. IMPROVING OUR OUR OUR- WAYS WATER SURVEIL. IMPROVING US. SYSTEMS HO GENOME SEQUENCING OUR READINESS OR ABILITY TO RESPOND ESPECIALLY SUPPORT THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. BY TESTING SCHOOLS AND THEN WHAT WE CALL THAT TESTING TO TREATMENT VALUE STREAM. MAKING SURE THAT AS- AS A TREATMENTS BECOME MORE AVAILABLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WERE ABLE TO GET IT TO EVERYBODY THAT THAT THAT NEEDS IT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE SO THEY COULD THEY COULD HAVE. A CLINICAL BENEFIT AND WE ALREADY KNOW FROM. WHAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN WITH COME WITH THAT THE STRUCTURAL HEALTH INEQUITIES MAKES THAT A CHALLENGE SO ALL THE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT AREAS THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO BE READY WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO VACCINATE FOLKS. AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR ANY NEW VARIANTS AND STRENGTH IN. THAT WITH THE ADVANCES WE'VE MADE BUT ALSO GET BETTER AT THEM. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TURN IT OVER TO BRAND HE'S GONNA HE'S GONNA COVER THE SPECIFICS AND THEN WE CAN ANSWER. QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AGAIN BRANDON YOUR WITH THE- SO AS YOU'RE AWARE LAST WEEK THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE WAS PASSED. THAT INCLUDED ONE POINT SIX BILLION FOR KOBE RELATED RESPONSE ACTIVITIES- THE ASSUMPTIONS ORIGINALLY IN THE TWENTY ONE.

OUR RESPONSE ACTIVITIES THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO THIS ISSUE THAT'S NOW BEFORE YOU CONTINUES THE SUPPORT FOR THE SAME COVERED RESPONSE NOW THROUGH THE- THE MIDDLE OF THE COMING BUDGET YEAR SO IT SENDS IT TO DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO- SO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILLION THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS ITEM IS FOR US TO FURTHER DOSE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. AND JUST TO KIND OF PROVIDE YOU KIND OF A BY THE NUMBERS FOR SOME OF THE BUCKETS- FOUR IN THE AREA VACCINATIONS AS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION THERE.

THERE'S A BIT ORIGINAL OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THERE'S THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION THAT'S INCLUDED FOR TESTING. THAT'S GOING TO GO TO PROVIDE SPECIMEN COLLECTION SERVICES THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODALITIES INCLUDING DRIVE THRU SITES MOBILE- AND SOME OF THOSE TRAVELING TEAMS I MENTIONED AND THEN SITE EXPANSION TO INCREASE- FOR EXISTING SIZE SIX- EXPAND THE NUMBER OF LANES. HOURS AND DAYS OF OPERATIONS AT CETERA- AND THEN OF COURSE IT ALSO GOES TO SUPPORT- DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OUT OF THE LAND SEA LAB BRANCH- IN THE AREA OF CONTACT. TRACING IS ROUGHLY EIGHTEEN MILLION THAT'S IN COLLUDED THERE MUCH OF WHICH IS TO- WE'RE START TO IN THE CURRY YEAR WITH. A ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN BY. IT'S TO ESTABLISH THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESERVE CORPS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESERVE COURSE GOING TO ASSIST US WITH RESPONSE TO A NUMBER OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

THANKS THANK YOU RIGHT NOW THANK YOU THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO LMAO. NOTHING IN THIS WITH A DIFFERENT. JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE WE DETECTED EARLY ACTIONS- SUBSAMPLE THE EIGHTEEN POINT TWO MILLION FOR CONTACT TRACING HIS THAT ACTUALLY THROUGH THE END OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE EARLY ACTION WAS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO. JUST WANNA CLARIFY. THAT IS SO IS THAT EIGHTEEN POINT TWO JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEARS BECAUSE WE PASSED AS PART OF THE ACTION AND THEN IT STOPS OR IS THAT. BAND NOW AUTHORIZED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE END OF THE TWENTY. I GUESS JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THIS AFFECTS THE SCHOOL YEAR. YEAH DEPUTIES FOR THIS ACTION IN TOTAL INCLUDING THE CONTACT TRACING. BASICALLY TAKES THE EARLY ACTION THAT BASICALLY GAVE US FUNDING TO JAN AND NOW THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILLION. WILL TAKE US THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. OKAY SO HOLD ON I JUST I CLARIFY SO. JUNE OF WHICH YEAR. SO THE TALKING WITH TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO THE EARLY ACTION GOES TILL JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO OKAY SO THAT'S COMING UP IN JUNE. OKAY AND THEN YOU SAID THE SEVEN SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY POINT EIGHT ACTUALLY ONLY TAKES US UP TO DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW TAKE US THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT'S WHAT THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE OKAY SO IT'S NOT REALLY TO TWENTY TWENTY SO IT'S- BASICALLY MID FISCAL YEAR THAT STOPS. OUT FOR THE BUDGET YEAR CORRECT PRICES ONLY FOR HALF THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE WILL HAPPEN IS. AFTER DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH AND JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE SAW THE HALF OF THE SCHOOL YEAR LEFT TO GO. RIGHT AND WE WOULD YOU KNOW KIND OF BE ASSESSING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE RESPONSE AT THAT TIME YOU'D BE ABLE TO UPDATE THESE ESTIMATES IT MAY REVISIONS IF THERE WAS A NEED BEYOND DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO I THINK WE LOOK TO DO UPDATES AND- REVISIONS. OKAY SO BASICALLY MAY REVISION MAY SEE SOME CHANGES BUT THAT THAT WOULD INCLUDE. THEN THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR. YES NETWORK WOULD. AT THAT THE S. PROCESS. THERE RIGHT YES YEAH I NEEDED IT COULD BE THAT SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR TO SEE THE LOWER ARE KNOWN TO MAN BUT I JUST WANT OKAY. SO I WOULD MAKE NOTE THOUGH IS THERE'S NO AT LEAST I DON'T SEE ANY MONEY FOR CONTACT TRACING PAST. JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS THAT IS THAT. IS THAT THE INTENTION OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING HE AND MAY YIELD GIVE US AN UPDATE AND MAYBE INCLUDE. MONEY FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME I'LL I'LL PASS IT OFF TO SOME OF THE I THINK WE HAVE SOME OF OUR FOLKS FROM THE CONTACT TRACING TEAM. HERE OUR **** AND THEY GOT A RESPONSE FAR AS HOW THE- BEST PHASING OUT OF CONTACT TRACING IS GOING AND THEN MOVING. INTO KIND OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING PUBLIC HEALTH RESERVE CORPS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE SOONER IF. THERE'S OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CONTACT TRACING TEAM THAT COULD HELP. I THINK WE WOULD RE EVALUATE IT MAY REVISE BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S CONTINUING MONEY FOR CONTACT TRACING. THE CAST. THOSE ARE BASICALLY CONTACT TRACING WILL THEN BE AND IF YOU LIMIT THE STATE FUNDING FOR CONTACT TRACING THE AND- WHO'S RESPONSIBLE CONTACT TRACING THEN. IS IT THAT WE JUST DUMP IT ON TO THE LOCALS THEN AND SAYING WE'RE NOT FUNDING ANYMORE I MEAN. ARE WE SAYING AND AS- SOON TO GEICO STOPPED ALL TWENTY FOUR OF. YOU WAITING WHAT WE WILL NEED AS WERE CHANGING SHIFTING POLICIES AROUND CONTACT RACING SO WHAT I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOMETHING IN MAY REVISE. OKAY ALL RIGHT- OKAY. AND THEN- THE OTHER ISSUE I GUESS. YEAH WE HAVE HERE A HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION FOR SCHOOL TESTING ACTIVITIES ETCETERA. IS THERE SOME IT'S I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME FEDERAL MONEY THAT ENDS AT JUNE THIRTIETH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THAT. THAT I KNOW WHEN THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE I DID ASK BUT I DON'T THINK I'VE GOTTEN BACK LIKE. HOW HOW MUCH OF THAT MONEY HAVE WE ACTUALLY SPENT. AND SO I WON'T BE SURE THAT WE'RE BUDGETING FOR WHAT PEOPLE NEED. SO THIS IS- BUT I WASN'T THAT. NO ONE IS ABLE TO TELL ME WAS THAT FUND OVER SUBSCRIBED UNDER SUBSCRIBED. SO IT IN ORDER TO INFORM WHAT WE GONNA BUDGET MOVING FORWARD IF YOU GET TO KNOW WHAT WE SPENT. IN THE PAST. TO KNOW WHETHER THAT'S IN LINE SO- IS THERE A MORE INFORMATION ON- WHAT SCHOOLS NEED FOR THEIR TETING AND ACTIVITIES AND SO FORTH OR MAYBE IT'S NOT THIS ISN'T. A PART OF THE BUDGET I MEAN YOU'RE THIS IS A C. PH BUDGETS- MAYBE. ANOTHER PART BUT I JUST WANNA CLARIFY. THAT WERE ARE WE PROVIDING SUFFICIENT SUPPORT. AND FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. THIRD CONTINUE THEIR TEST THAT. THERE ACTIVITIES TO. MASS AT OUR SO I GUESS THIS IS MY SPECIFIC AROUND TESTING SPECIMENS. TO CATS UPSET ON CHRISTMAS OF THE MONEY YOU SAY FOR SCHOOL IS OUR TEST. RIGHT CORRECT AND- AND I UNDERSTAND IS CURRENTLY FEDERAL FUNDING BUT IT ENDS IN JUNE THIRTIETH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. HI KATHY JACOBSEN- GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR CAMP. YEAH WE'VE ENCUMBERED ALMOST ALL OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS. THAT WORK. OFFERED THROUGH YOU'LL SEE HER SCHOOL'S TESTING. AS WELL AS- IN ADDITION TO THAT. BOB PURCHASING. TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN OVER THE COUNTER CHANNELS. THAT WE PURCHASED OVER THE LAST. FIVE OR SIX WEEKS. RIGHT WHICH WILL PREDOMINANTLY BE USED TO SUPPORT. SCHOOLS. AND TEACHERS FOR TESTING. OKAY I'LL ALL RIGHT EXACTLY I ASKED HIM BECAUSE THIS AGAIN BUT YOU CAN ON ASK ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN SPENT THE AND NOW USING THAT INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE WHAT OUR NEEDS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. AND IT AND SO THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY THE THRUST MY QUESTION IS SO HOW MUCH ARE WE SPENT. IN THE PAST. AFTER YEARS OF LOSSES THAT IS THAT THE UNDER FIFTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION REFLECTIVE OF THE RATE AT WHICH WE SPENT WE'VE HAD TO SPEND MONEY. TO DATE FOR TESTING FOR SCHOOLS IS INOTES IS IT SUFFICIENT- AND I MEAN I'M GUESSING THAT YOU PROPOSED IT. IN SOME FORM OF SUFFICIENCY IT IS BUT HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT NUMBER. AND I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SPEAK SPECIFIC TO THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION BUT I CAN TELL YOU WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. ESTIMATING WHAT OUR FORESEE THEM BEING MOVING FORWARD. BUT SPECIFICALLY TO ABOUT A HUNDRED OR FIFTY EIGHT MILLION I DON'T KNOW BRANDON IF YOU WANNA. SPEAKER THAT'S. YEAH THIS IS BRENDA SIGMUND APARTMENT AND TO YOUR POINT WE DID TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THINGS LIKE THE FEDERAL GRANT RESOURCES THAT LIKE YOU SAID EXPIRED KIND OF AT THE END OF JUNE OR COMING TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF JUNE AND HOW WE'RE USING THOSE TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND THEN LOOK TO THE GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT WASN'T YOU IT WASN'T GONNA BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR BRANCH AS WELL SO DID THE GENERAL FUND IS MEANT TO KIND OF. CONTINUE SUPPORT FOR THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN OKAY BUT WE DID GET CLOSE OKAY WELL I JUST WANNA BE SURE OUR SCHOOLS DON'T HIT A CLIFF AT THE JUNE WHEN THE GEAR UP AGAIN FOR THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR AND FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT ADEQUATE SUPPORT FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO PROTECT STUDENTS AT SCHOOL. EARLY- DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. NOT AT THIS TIME DOCTOR AGAIN OKAY ALL RIGHT. SO I JUST I DO I'M SURE YOU KNOW WE WILL- BUT SO I'M SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR SCHOOLS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR SCHOOLS OPENED SO I WILL BE SURE THE SCHOOLS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES OPEN AND- HE'LL CERTAINLY THEY GET FUNDING FROM THE STATE FOR EDUCATION. THIS IS PUBLIC HEALTH STUFF SO- TO CERTAIN DEGREE I THINK THAT NOT ALL IT SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF THEIR EDUCATION FUNDS WHO SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THIS PUBLIC HEALTH SUPPORT AND- BE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR THE SCHOOLS STAY OPEN.

GROSS- WE ARE WE'RE GOING TO LA OR DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT- LIKE A MADAM CHAIR YOU ASKING FOR OUR INPUT ON THAT YEAH YOUR INPUT ON WHAT YOU WANT TO RUN THROUGH EVERYTHING OR IS THERE A NATURAL STOPPING POINT YOU SEE FOR YOUR ANALYSIS OF MEDICARE IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING DO YOU WANT JUST LIT UP WHICH ITEMS YOU PLAN TO COMMENT ON THAT. HOW'S THAT. YEAH HAVE SOME COMMON WHEN WE GET INTO THE CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED ITEMS WHICH ARE ISSUES NINE AND TEN- AND- SO WHEN WE WHEN WE TAKE FIVE TO TEN AND THEN WE'LL STOP AND THEN WITH THEM WILL MAKE A NEW PLAN HAS THAT. OKAY THANK YOU FOR ASKING YEAH YES SAID THANK YOU DOCTOR PAIN FEAR HERE THAT HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE. OKAY DEPARTMENT LET'S START THEN WITH ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO BE A ROBERT THOMAS THOMAS. HELLO I'M ROBERT THOMAS ON THE BRANCH CHIEF OF LAB FIELD SERVICES KNOWN WIDELY AS A LOT FAST. HELLO FAST WITHIN CDPH OVERSEAS CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH LABS AND PERSONNEL ISSUE BANKS IN BIOLOGICS PRODUCTION THROUGH FREE SUPPORTED PROGRAMS. CALABASAS IS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED ONLINE ELECTRONIC LICENSING FOR LABORATORY PERSONNEL AND CLINICAL PUBLIC HEALTH LABS HOWEVER IT HAS NOT DONE SO PARTITION BANK IN BIOLOGICS PROGRAM. SO WHAT IS BEING REQUESTED IN THIS VCP IS INCREASED SPENDING AUTHORITY TO COMPLETE THE THIRD AND FINAL PHASE OF A LARGER PROJECT. TO TRANSITION ELLEVEST FROM A PAPER BASED LICENSE APPLICATION PROCESS TO AN ONLINE SYSTEM FOR TISSUE BANK AND BIOLOGICS PRODUCTION UNIT. WHICH OVERSEES MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS- PERSONALITIES. THE COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL CLEAR UP FINDINGS RECOMMENDING THAT TALLAHASSEE ENHANCE ITS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DATA. SYSTEMS THANK. THE RESULT WILL BE THAT ENHANCE OF OUR ELECTRON SYSTEM WILL AND THE FISH FOR APP APPLICATIONS FREEING PROGRAM STAFF TO INCREASE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ESPECIALLY INSPECTION AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF PERSONALITIES. AT THESE FACILITIES COLLECT PROCESS STORE AND DISTRIBUTE DISTRIBUTE KITCHEN BLOOD BANK PRODUCTS FROM LIVING AND DECEASED DONORS FOR HUMAN TRANSPLANTATION AND IMPLANTATION. STEM CELLS WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH. IMPROVED DATA COLLECTION WILL SUPPORT PROGRAM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT% AS WELL AS COLLABORATION WITH OTHER PROGRAMS ON ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES SO ONE IN CONCLUSION HOW WILL THE SPENDING AUTHORITY BE USE SO FOR FIRST YEAR THREE POINT SIX MILLION TOTAL. TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR I. D. EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FOUR STAFF WERE ASKING FOR XIX POSITIONS SHAGGY HERE ONE POINT ONE MILLION FOR IT COST. EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAIN FOR STAFF AND SO THE OE POINT NINE MILLION WOULD BE ONGOING GOING FORWARD SH. SH THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX- THE LAST EPIDEMIC WE HAD THE- A DOUBT PROGRAM AIDS. DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ESTIMATE. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS INACCURATE AND I AM THE CHIEF OF THE FISCAL FORECASTING EVALUATION AND MONITORING SECTION THAT OVERSEES THE ESTIMATION. AND UNLESS THERE IS ANOTHER PREFERENCE ALL QUICKLY SURE THE GENERAL FUND SUMMARY AND THE- REFINING UTILIZATION PROJECTIONS AND THE THREE ASSUMPTIONS WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPACT NOTED IN THE AGENDA. I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK ON OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IF WANTED. PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO PLAYS IS VERY PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL CONTINUES TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S LAMINATION TO GETTING TO ZERO PLAN TO IMPROVE HIV SURVEILLANCE PREVENT NEW INFECTIONS AND CARE FOR THOSE LIVING WITH HIV. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR HIV SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS. AND TWENTY THREE POINT NINE MILLION PROPOSAL YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR THE HIV PREVENTION PROGRAM. FUNDING FOR THE AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS COMES FROM A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL GRANTS AND SPECIAL FUNDS. SPECIFICALLY THE FEDERAL TRUST FUND CONTAINING THE FEDERAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICE ADMINISTRATION GRANT DOLLARS. AND THE ETAPE REBATE FUND SPECIAL FUN THREE THIRTY EIGHTY WHICH CONTAINS OUR PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER REBATES. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET ESTIMATE CONTAINS REVISED PROJECTIONS FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR COSTS BOTH ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED. FOR THE CURRENT YEAR COST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED EIGHT UP LOCAL ASSISTANCE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION. REVISED CURRENT YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. THE MILLION A DECREASE OF ABOUT ELEVEN POINT TWENTY ONE BUDGET. ACT OVERALL COSTS RESPECTIVELY LOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED IS THE MAJOR FACTOR. IS MEDICATION COSTS FOR THE UNINSURED CLIENTS WHICH IS DRIVEN MAINLY BY OVERALL CLIENT VOLUME WHICH IS IMPACTED BY ATTRITION. AND THE CLIENT MIX ARE SHIFTING CLIENTS FROM UNRESTRICTED PRIVATE OR MEDICARE COVERAGE- WHICH HAVE A SHARE OF COST. SO WE'VE GOT MAINLY A VOLUME AND MIX- DRIVER THE MEDICATION PRICES HAVE STAYED AROUND WHERE WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE. THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ESTIMATE ALSO CLICK CONTAINS REVISED ESTIMATES FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR REVENUE WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE LOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT AN INCREASE- BY TWO POINT 7% TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS WE ALSO EXPECT A DROP OF ABOUT SIXTY MILLION. FIFTEEN POINT 7% AND A NET REBATE FUNDS IN THE OVERALL CLIENT VOLUME AND CHANGES TO THE CLIENT NEXT I DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY. WITH YOUR CLIENTS OR IF YOUR CLAIMS IN WESTERN REBATE. AND ALTHOUGH ATTRITION IS A MAJOR DRIVER ALSO WITH EACH CLIENT BECOMES INSURED BUT IT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS FAVORABLE RETURNS- ARE DEPENDING ON WHICH MEDICATIONS THAT ARE TAKING. SO THE REDUCED CLIENT VOLUME AND THE SHIPS IN THE ASIA CLIENT MIX ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET YEAR. SO FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THE PROPOSED EIGHT LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING IS FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION. I DROP OF SIXTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION OR 14% WHEN COMPARED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. WE EXPECT A DECREASE OF THREE POINT ONE MILLION- 3% IN THE EXPECTED FEDERAL FUNDS AND A SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION SEVENTEEN POINT 2% DROP IN PROJECTED ADA REBATE FUNDS. THE SUMMER HIS SUMMARY OF THESE FUNDING SOURCES CAN BE SEEN ON THE TABLE ONE OF THE- TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE EIGHT OUT NOVEMBER ESTIMATE. I WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF TIME- SO I WANTED TO STOP YOUR GROUP FOR PRESENTING ON THE THREE MEDICARE SPECIFIC TEACHER POST CALL SOMETIMES AND ONE. ASSUMPTION THAT WOULD EXPAND THE PROVISION OF HIV MEDICATION ASSISTANCE TO THOSE CONTAINED IN CALIFORNIA JAILS. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OVERALL. COST. OKAY SO NEWLY INTRODUCED TO THE CYCLE DO STAKEHOLDER INTEREST INSURING PARITY BETWEEN THE MEDICARE COVERS GROUPS. WE HAVE A PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PART D. PREMIUMS PLUS EXPANSION THIS IS THE FUTURE THIS CALL IS SHE WALL CDPH OPPOSITES CONDUCTS THIS DISCOVERY TO REFINE THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND THEN ALSO TO CONFIRM AN IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND ONCE WE HAVE THE SCOPE AND THE PROPOSED SCHEDULE BURNED UP. WE CAN ESTIMATE HE NEEDED RESOURCES. BUT FOR BACKGROUND. RIGHT NOW ALL THE OFFICE SPACE PAYS THE PREMIUMS AN OUTPATIENT MEDICAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS. FOR OUR CLIENTS TO HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND MEDICARE PART D. AND WHEN IT ENDED UP CLIENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE THEY HAVE TO ENROLL IN MEDICARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THE PAYER OF LAST RESORT. IF THEY ENROLL IN MEDICARE PART D. THEY CAN GET HELP WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL OR MEDIGAP PLAN PREMIUM ASSISTANCE BUT IN CONTRAST A CLIENT WHO ENROLLS IN MEDICARE PART SEE. THEY CAN GET NO PREMIUM ASSISTANCE AND THEY CAN NOT GET NO MEDICAL OUT OF POCKET COST ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW WHICH CREATES A LACK OF PARITY. IN EIGHT US MEDICARE SERVICE DELIVERY. MEDICARE PART C. ALSO KNOWN AS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE IS THE BUNDLED INSURANCE PLAN OF COURSE THAT INCLUDES THE HOSPITAL BENEFITS FOR MEDICARE PART A- MEDICAL CARE PART B. AND THE PRESCRIPTIONS. MEDICARE PART D. SO D. R. FEDERAL FUNDERS POLICY HELPS US TO CLOSE THAT GAP UNDER THAT POLICY GRANT RECIPIENTS CAN NOW USE THE FUNDS TO PAY THE PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING WHEN THE MEDICARE PART C. PLAN INCLUDES PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE. SO END UP IS PROPOSING TO USE THE REBATE FUNDS TO ESTABLISH THE MEDICARE PART C. PREMIUM PAYMENT PROGRAM AND PAY FOR MEDICARE PART B. PREMIUMS FOR THOSE ELIGIBLE EIGHT OUT CLIENTS. THERE IS NO KNOWN PHYSICAL IMPACT AT THIS TIME- BUT WE ARE FIRMING UP THE SCOPE AND THE SCHEDULE AND THEN ONCE WE DO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BEFORE I MOVE ON TO. THE NEXT MEDICARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SO THIS NEXT SECTION IS A COROLLARY TO THE LAST ASSUMPTION DUE TO STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS AND ALSO TO ENSURE PARITY BETWEEN THE MEDICARE COVERAGE GROUPS- IT'S ALSO A TEACHER AT SCHOOL WHILE WE CONDUCT OUR DISCOVERY ONCE WE HAVE THE SCOPE AND THE SCHEDULE PERMED UP WE CAN ESTIMATE THE RESOURCES NEEDS SO THIS IS- BSICALLY INVEST IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE PRIVATE INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE THE CLIENTS WHO ARE IN OUR- MEDICARE PREMIUM PAYMENT PROGRAM WE ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. COVERAGE FOR THE MEDICAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS AS WELL. SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT- ESTABLISHING EQUITABLE BENEFITS FOR INSTANCE TRANSISTORS AND PROGRAMS AND THEN ALSO TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR AN APPLIANCE AS THE AGE AND BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. AND THE FISCAL IMPACT IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME BUT WE WILL KNOW MORE ONCE WERE ABLE TO THE SCOPING AND THE- SCHEDULE CLARIFICATION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT ASSUMPTION BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE MEDICARE COVERAGE OF EXTRA AND INNOVATIVE SUPPLEMENTAL PLANS NOW PLEASE MOVE ON. OKAY ALSO NEWLY INTRODUCED THE CYCLE AND A COROLLARY TO THE LAST ASSUMPTION- WE ARE LOOKING AT. I'M LOOKING AT COVERING THESE SUPPLEMENTAL PLANS A SPECIFIC KIND OF SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR THE MEDIGAP PLANS- AND THEIR VARYING LEVELS OF COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTAL PLANS A THROUGH AND WITH F. AND G. BEING THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. OBVIOUS MOST COMPREHENSIVE PLANS ALSO OFFER EXTRA INNOVATIVE BENEFITS TO COVER SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE BASE MEDICAL COVERAGE EXAMPLES OF THESE EXTRA BENEFITS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE SILVER SNEAKERS GYM MEMBERSHIPS NURSE CONSULTATIONS- HEARINGS. AIDS VISION EXAMS AND ALL OF OUR MODELS THAT LOOK AT HER IN A POPULATION SHOW THAT ARE IN THE POPULATION IS AGING ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE INSURED AND DUE TO VARIOUS ADVANCEMENTS IN CARE TREATMENT- THEY'RE LIVING LONGER AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR HEALTH NEEDS ARE MET. OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIFE- SOME OF THESE EXTRA BENEFITS ARE RELATED TO THINGS LIKE- THEIR SOCIAL NEEDS REDUCING SOCIAL ISOLATION AND SO WHAT WE SEE WITH OUR AGING POPULATION AS AS PEOPLE GROW OLDER THEY TEND TO SPEND MORE MORE TIME ALONE. AND WITH THE STIGMA THAT COMES WITH AN HIV DIAGNOSIS THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY AN APPLE. FOR OUR CLIENTS SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING TO DO IS- WE HAVE OUR BEEN PAID. THE MEDIC. RB SUPPLEMENTAL MEDICAL PLAN PREMIUMS- WE WANT TO EXTEND THIS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN COVER THESE EXTRA AN INNOVATIVE BENEFITS UP AND WE ARE LOOKING TO USE THE REBATE FUNDS TO PAY FOR THIS. THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF FOLKS LIVING WITH HIV MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE FULL RANGE OF CHOICES TO INSURE THAT THEY CAN STAY HEALTHY BECAUSE HEALTH IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST THEIR- THEIR BASIC NEEDS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOCIAL HELL. AND THAT THEY HAVE A WAY TO MEET ALL OF THEIR NEEDS AS THEY AGE- AND SO THAT THEY'RE NOT LOCKED INTO ANY ONE PARTICULAR PLAN JUST BECAUSE THEY NEED HELP FROM US. SO THE PHYSICAL IMPACT RIGHT NOW IS STILL UNKNOWN BUT WE ARE FIRMING UP LIKE I SAID THE SCOPE AND THE SCHEDULE AND WE'LL HAVE A FIRMER ESTIMATE OF THE RESOURCE NEEDS. COMING ONCE WE HAVE DONE. WERE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ON OKAY ON THOSE THREE MEDICARE RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE EXTENSIONS OF OKAY. SO THE LAST ASSUMPTION IS NEWLY IMPLEMENTED IN IT WAS RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF CARE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE TANGLED UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OF. BEFORE TWENTY EIGHTEEN EIGHT I'VE HAD ABOUT THIRTY SIX LOCAL COUNTY JAILS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE END UP PROGRAM TO PROVIDE MEDICATION ASSISTANCE TO THOSE WHO QUALIFY BEFORE THEY WERE RELEASED THE PROGRAM WAS ENDED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO ELIMINATION FINDING. RECENTLY OUR FEDERAL GRANT FUNDERS UPDATED THEIR POLICIES THAT ALLOW THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DETAINED IN THE COUNTY JAIL BUT AREN'T YET CONVICTED OF A CRIME AND ARE NOT COVERED BY THE FEDERAL OR STATE HEALTH BENEFITS WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED. SO AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THAT POLICY CHANGE OR ACCOUNT OR TO COUNTY ASKED US IF IT UP COULD PROVIDE SERVICES AT THE COUNTY JAIL AND THAT WOULD EXPAND THE OUTREACH TO A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION. AND THEN ALSO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR ANY OF OUR OWN EIGHT UP PLANS FOR NAVIGATING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. SO ONCE RESPONSE TO THE REQUEST AND STAKEHOLDER TO MANAGE- A LOST A SMALL PILOT PROGRAM WITH THEIR COUNTY JAIL. IN ORANGE COUNTY AND WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THE PILOT PROGRAM- REGULARLY AND CONSIDERING EXPANDING THAT PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE. TWO OTHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED AND THOSE OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE INTERESTED OUR LOS ANGELES MORAN. RIVERSIDE SAN FRANCISCO ALLEN'S OF THIS PHOTO AND SINCE YOU. AND OF COURSE IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE IMPACT TO THE THAT REBATE POND. IN THE SHORT AND THE LONG TERM- IS REQUESTING THAT THE EIGHT AT GL PILOT PROGRAM THAT'S IN ORANGE COUNTY BE EXTENDED TO THE OTHER INTERESTED COUNTY JAILS. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. WE WOULD MEET WHEN THE INTERESTED COUNTY JAILS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY OPERATE HOW THEY DO THEIR TESTING. WE WOULD DETERMINE. IF THIS IS A SUITABLE OPERA GRAHAM FOR THEM THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE NORMAL ENROLLMENT SITE APPLICATION AND TURN CONTRACTS WITH US. HE ADDED TO OUR PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGERS PHARMACY NETWORK AND COMPLETE THE NUMERAL OR TRAINING BEFORE THEY CAN START ENROLLING ANY ELIGIBLE CLIENTS. SO THEY HAVE BEEN FULLY TRAINED- THEY'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONTROLS AS ARE IN REMOTE WORKERS DO- BUT- WE'RE LOOKING AT- EIGHT POTENTIAL THAT CAUSAL IMPACT- IS NOT CHANGED ORANGE COUNTY BUT WE HAVE PROVIDED THE IMPACT FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- AND- WE ARE LOOKING. AT THE END ACCOUNTING. ORANGE COUNTY. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WITH ELEVEN. SEVEN MILLION- AND THE ESTIMATED IMPACT FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OF THE FIVE POINT ONE MILLION ACTUALLY TAKE OUT REBATE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS- OPPOSED EXPANSION NOW THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE IN THAT PACKAGE NOW WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ZERO NASH AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN WITH MARISSA AND ROSS. GOOD AFTERNOON AMARISTA RAMOS THE CHIEF FOR THE OFFICE DEBATE. AND THAT WILL SPEAK ON- AB THREE OH SIX SO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REQUEST THREE POSITIONS I'M FOR HONDA'S PLEASE SENATOR PAN. IS IT A B. IT'S S. B. S. B. DARI.

THE REQUESTED FUNDING- AND PHYSICIANS ARE FOR TO HEALTH PROGRAM SPECIALIST ONES AND ONE ASSOCIATE CHAD GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYST. WE ARE REQUESTING THOSE POSITIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE NEEDED TO MANAGE THE INCREASE FOR WORKLOAD RELATED TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SP THREE OH SIX ALLOWING HIV TEST COUNSELORS TO PERFORM ANY H. I. B. H. C. B. OR OTHER STD TESTS. THAT IS CLASSIFIED AS WAVES UNDER CLIA. ANY QUESTIONS NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT PUBLIC HEALTH CODE NINETEEN SP. THREE THIRTY SIX. THANK YOU HI THIS IS JAMES WHITE AGAIN- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REQUESTS SHE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEARS TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FROM THE STATE GENERAL FUND TO FULLY COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SB THREE THIRTY SIX. THE STATUTE REQUIRES CDPH TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN AN EMAIL DISTRIBUTION LIST.

COORDINATE MESSAGES FOR DISTRIBUTION AND POSTING ON THE WEBSITE. I'M MANAGING NECESSARY MODIFICATIONS TO THE SYSTEM MONITOR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE PROVIDE ANALYTICS AND REPORTS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RELATED TO THEIR OWN SP THREE THIRTY SIX OF ORANGE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ISSUE NUMBER NINE DR RADHAKRISHNAN. SURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AT REGARDING ISSUE NUMBER NINE CLIMATE AND HEALTH SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. CLIMATE CHANGE IS CONSIDERED THE GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND IS IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS TODAY THIS INCLUDES THE IMPACT FROM INJURY ILLNESS DEATH WILDFIRE SMOKE EXTREME HEAT DROUGHT LANDSLIDES EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS VICTOR BORNE DISEASES AND MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS THE HARMS ARE ALSO IMPOSE DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. AS REFERENCED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TENTH BLUEPRINT IT IS THE SECOND pTACKLE AND AS REFERENCED BY DIRECTOR I DON'T GO ON REGARDING THE FOUR PILLARS OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN COLOR NUMBER ONE ECO SOCIAL APPROACHFOR THE CONDITIONS AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT CREATE HEALTHY OPPORTUNITIES. TO CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS ONE OF THE FEW U. S. STATES THAT LACKS A STATEWIDE SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE MECHANISM FOR KEEPING THIS AS AN EXAMPLE AND OUR DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PROVIDE A REAL TIME COUNT OF DEATHS OR ILLNESSES FOR SOMETHING LIKE EXTREME HEAT. DEVELOPMENT OF A SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE NEAR REAL TIME DATA FROM EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUES EARLY MONITOR TRENDS TRACK AND TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THIS WITH MANY OFFICIALS AT THE STATE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC THEREFORE IN THIS ITEM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REQUESTS THIRTY POSITIONS AND GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE OF TEN MILLION ANNUALLY. THESE POSITIONS AND RESOURCES WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THIS NEAR REAL TIME NOTIFICATION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FIRST RESPONDERS AND COMMUNITY FOR A VARIETY OF INTENSIFIED CLIMATE SENSITIVE DISEASES THAT DIRECTOR ARTICLE MENTIONED WERE INCREASING SCALE SCOPE AND SEVERITY IN THE YEARS TO COME I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT EXTREME HEAT OR WILDFIRES SMOKE THERE'S MANY OTHER CLIMATE SENSITIVE VECTOR BORNE DISEASES LIKE WEST NILE VIRUS THERE'S WATER BORNE DISEASES LIKE VIBRIO. FOOD. BORNE ILLNESSES WHICH YOU REFERENCED THE TERMS FOOD C. SO AND THE MAN HEALTH AND TAX. SO WE WOULD. WITH THE FEDERAL CDC'S SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM THROUGH A PROGRAM CALLED BIOSENSOR PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO COLLECT ANALYZE AND SHARE ELECTRONIC PATIENT ENCOUNTER DATA FROM EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. CURRENTLY WE DO NOT ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THIS PROGRAM AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT THESE FUNDS WOULD ALLOW US TO DO SO. WE COULD UPGRADE DATA SYSTEMS FOR REPORTING ANALYSIS DISPLAY COMMUNICATION DATA TRANSFER AND SHARING WITH MANY PARTNERS. AND ALSO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ACCESS VIEW ANALYZE AND USE THIS DATA ULTIMATELY THE AIM IS TO CREATE PREDICTIVE ANALYTIC MODELS. FOR NOT JUST THE INCIDENTS BUT ALSO THE ABILITY TO PROACTIVELY MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME CLIMATE. AND FUNDING WOULD ALSO BE USED FOR THE FEES FOR HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO PAY ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD VENDORS TO ESTABLISH THIS CONNECTION. FINALLY WE WOULD EMPLOY A COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST TO HELP COMMUNICATE OUT THE RESULTS FOR ACTIONABLE SOLUTIONS. TO DIVERSE PARTNERS INCLUDING THE MEDIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S JUST GO RIGHT ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TEN THEN AND NOW HERE FOR MILLENNIA. THANK YOU- SO AS MENTION CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS MANY ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES NOT JUST HEALTH BUT ALSO LIVELIHOODS BUSINESSES CROPS HOMES- CONTRIBUTES TO UNEMPLOYMENT POVERTY AND THE HOUSING CRISIS. THERE FOR ISSUE NUMBER TEN REALLY FOCUSES ON PUBLIC HEALTH REGIONAL CLIMATE PLANNING. ON THE IMPACTS ARE CASCADING ON MANY ASPECTS OF HEALTH FROM CHRONIC AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE TO MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. AND TO ADDRESS THIS IN A MORE PROACTIVE IN PLANNING APPROACH WE REQUESTED GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE REQUESTED FUNDING AND SUPPORT TO DO MORE PROACTIVE WORK IN TERMS OF PLANNING. IT ALSO ALLOWS THE FUND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND TRIBES TO DEVELOP REGIONAL CLIMATE AND HEALTH RESILIENCE PLANS. ON DOING SO WOULD ALLOW RESOURCE LIMITED HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITIES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PREVENT AND REDUCE THE INEQUITABLE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RISKS. EACH OF THE FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER REGIONS WOULD BE SUPPORTED TO WRITE A CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH RESILIENCE PLAN THAT WOULD BE COORDINATED I WANTED TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL- THERE'S A LONG LIST OF THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN AT THE REGIONAL LOCAL LEVEL THAT I WON'T GO INTO BUT WE WOULD PROVIDE. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE TO THE AWARDEES TO PRIORITIZE THE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD BE MOST IMPACTED AND ENGAGE THEM- IN THIS LOCAL PLANNING AND AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL AND IF RESOURCES DEPARTMENT- REGIONAL COALITIONS COULD BEGIN. PROSPECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING MADAM CHAIR CINEMATIC FROM THE LA- WE JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT EACH OF THE PROPOSALS- ON ISSUE NINE THE CLIMATE AND HEALTH SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS- PROPOSAL DOESN'T DRESS- CURRENT GAP IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED- EVENTS AND PARTICULARLY THAT THE HEALTH- IN IN. MONITORING THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE RELATED EVENTS IN THE PROPOSAL DOES HAVE A NUMBER OF MERITS ONE WE KNOW THAT THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW PARTICULARLY AS THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF CLIMATE RELATED WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE REAL TIME ANALYSIS- ALLOWING FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF OUTBREAKS- IT WILL ALSO FACILITATE BETTER PLANNING BY INCREASING AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAGNITUDE OF POTENTIAL FUTURE MAGNITUDE OF SOME OF THE VARIOUS. TYPES OF HEALTH IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE RELATED EVENTS AND HOW THESE IMPACTS REALLY AFFECTS- BOTH DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE AS WELL AS DIFFERENT REGIONS- AROUND THE STATE AND THEN WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IT ALLOWS- OR WE HOPE THIS WILL ALLOW FOR BETTER EVALUATION- FOR EXAMPLE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE VERY IS DATA COLLECTED WE HOPE WOULD FACILITATE A MORE ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE TAKEN TO REDUCE. THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE- IN IN SPEAKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL- WE WOULD JUST ALSO NOTE THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE CDC'S BIO SENSE PROGRAM REALLY ENABLES CALIFORNIA TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WITH OTHER STATES AND THEN ENGAGE IN CALIFORNIA CAN ENGAGE THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS IN A STATE LEVEL COMMUNITY OF. PRACTICE- THE ONE THAT THAT WE WULD RAISE WITH THE PROPOSED WHICH IS THIS IS A CREEK OF THE PROPOSED ITSELF IT'S MORE MORE JUST A COMMENT- SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DETECT ISSUES AND OUTBREAKS. EARLY AND DO THAT SORT OF REAL TIME ANALYSIS THAT WAS DISCUSSED. BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT- BEYOND JUST SORT OF NOTIFICATION- SO FOR EXAMPLE HOW WILL THIS TO USE THIS INFORMATION IN REAL TIME TO ACTIVATE A RESPONSE BY THE RELEVANT STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES- IS AN IMPORTANT SHOW- WERE YOU KNOW. SORT OF FOLLOW UP QUESTION AND IT. I THINK THIS MAKES THIS IS A GOOD SEGUE ACTUALLY INTO OUR COMMENTS ON THE NEXT PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW WHICH REALLY INVOLVES THE PLANNING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. AND BEFORE I GET INTO SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL I'M GONNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE A GENERAL POINT ABOUT NOT ONLY THIS. PROPOSAL ISSUE NUMBER TEN BUT ALSO A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- BUDGET AND IN FACT THE SCHOOL MAYBE REDUCE THE NEED HER TO CALL ON THE LA- ON A NUMBER OF THE FUTURE- ITEMS- WE JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR THAT REQUEST ONE TIME. FUNDING FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE- SO IT INCLUDES THIS PROPOSAL FOR REGIONAL CLIMATE PLANNING- THERE'S ANOTHER PROPOSAL- FOR BOOKS FOR CHILDREN IN THE WICK PROGRAM SH THERE'S ONE TO SUPPORT THE FITNESS KEPT THE GOVERNOR'S FITNESS COUNCIL. AND THERE'S ONE FOR EXAMPLE FOR GRANTS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE- PILOT PROGRAMS. AND WE WERE OUR OFFICE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS MAY MAKE SENSE THIS YEAR FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE STATE DOES HAVE A- DISCRETIONARY BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR. BUT WE HAVE NO GUARANTEE THAT THOSE REVENUES ARE GOING TO REMAIN AT THAT LEVEL SH SO OUR OFFICE REGULARLY CAUTIONS AGAINST- OVER COMMITTING FUNDING TO ONGOING PROGRAMS DURING GOOD TIMES THAT CANNOT REALISTICALLY BE. SUSTAINED DURING DOWNTURNS- IT ALSO MAKES SENSE TO DO ONE TIME- I DO HAVE ONE TIME AUGMENTATIONS WANTED APARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE WANTS TO TEST OUT A PROGRAM ON A LIMITED BASIS TO SEE IF IT WOULD BRING VALUE SH- SUCH AS REDUCING- AND NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACT- HEALTH DISPARITY OR TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. SH HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT WAS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THE HISTORIC CHALLENGES IN THIS DEPARTMENT IS THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THE FUNDING.IS PROVIDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR I'M SPECIFIC PURPOSE. AND THEN WHEN THE FOR GOES AWAY THE STAR OF- EXTRA- THE VAL THAT THAT PROGRAM BROUGHT- CAN ALSO SOMETIMES GO AWAY. SO WE WOULD JUST SUGGEST MAKING SURE THAT- THE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED THIS YEAR SORT OF KIND OF EXISTING RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE. OR OR LAY A FOUNDATION HAT CAN BE- ACTED UPON- IN THE FUTURE WITH AN EXISTING- RESOURCES. ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL SORRY FOR THE LONG WINDED- SORT OF COMMENTARY ABOUT ONE TIME PROPOSALS BUT- ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE THINK IT HAS A LOT OF MARRIAGE WE ARE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE STAFFER EXPERTISE TO CONDUCT- PLANNING RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH TO CONSIDER OR ASK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT- WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL DRAWBACKS OF HAVING THESE PLANS WILL BE CREATED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS TO HAVING A REGIONAL REGIONAL PLANNING IN PLACE PARTICULARLY FOR AN ISSUE LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH DOES NOT RESPECT COUNTY BORDERS- HOWEVER THIS PROPOSAL ONLY INCLUDES FUNDING FOR CERTAIN COUNTIES EVEN THOUGH THE PLANNING WILL BE DONE AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. AND OUR CONCERN IS- JUST ABOUT ENGAGEMENT BY THE OTHER LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS WHO- WHO DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDING TO PARTICIPATE IN WHETHER THEY'LL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FULLY ENGAGE. AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WEWOULD RAISE IS IT'S JUST HARD TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THESE PLANS ARE IN PLACE- WILL WILL THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE PLANS IF THEY DON'T HAVE. THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO DO SO THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME THERE AND- FOR ALLOWING THE COMMENTARY ON ONE TIME AUGMENTATIONS AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK WE'LL SHARE YOUR YOUR CONCERNS AND HESITATION TO ABOUT ONE TIME FUNDS AND THE YOU KNOW SOMETHING REALLY GOOD HAPPENS AND THEN A COUPLE YEARS LATER IT GOES AWAY AND EVERYONE SAYS THAT WAS SO GOOD- I THINK I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY TO THE- INTERVENED N. H. DEPARTMENT ON THAT PRESENTATION JUST THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK I LOST FRIENDS LAST YEAR WHO. HAD BEEN LIVING WITH HIV AIDS AND SHE WAS PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE AND HE JUST DIED THIS YEAR AT SIXTY SO WE KNOW THE WORK IS GOOD AND IMPORTANT- AND I WOULD SAY ON THE CLIMATE A MINUTE I'M GLAD ON ISSUE NUMBER NINE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT WE HAVE. WE CAN JUST. USUALLY WE DON'T HAVE TO RECREATE SOMETHING FROM THE WHEEL IS AT THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE'RE GONNA. BRING TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE NATIONAL MODEL TO BE ABLE TO SET SOMETHING UP. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. DO WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY ALREADY AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO. AS WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. TO BE ABLE TO PRETTY SEAMLESSLY. PUT THAT IN PLACE NOW IS MY QUESTION ON ISSUE NUMBER NINE. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I'LL BRIEFLY ADDRESS MISS PATRICK'S COMMENTS AS WELL SO- CURRENTLY THERE ARE. EIGHTEEN COUNTIES THAT HAD AT LEAST ONE FACILITY THAT IS PARTICIPATING. IN THIS- BUT- TO MAKE IT REALLY SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE TEN THE- THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FACILITIES AND THERE'S OTHER TYPES OF FACILITIES AS WELL- BERTHING FACILITIES- AND OTHERS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE INCENTIVES IN THE TRAINING IN THE ONBOARDING. BUT THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE. ARE ADEQUATE- IT'S JUST INCENTIVIZING. LOCAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO GO THE NEXT STEP- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MODERNIZATION OF THE CDC BIOSENSOR PLATFORM SO IT'S MORE USER FRIENDLY WAS DESIGNED FOR. BIOTERRORISM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE. AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WENT THROUGH A LOT OF UPGRADES- AND SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TAT TAT TAT SPREAD THIS FURTHER. ON BUT TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS MISS PANICS POINT ABOUT SOME OF THE DRAWBACKS- WE WOULD AGREE THAT REGIONAL IS A GOOD PLACE TO START IT'S NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. ALL SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS HAVE. ON THEIR OWN GENERAL PLANS HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS CLIMATE ACTION PLANS. AND FUNDING PERMITTED- IT WOULD BE IDEAL TO NOT JUST DO THIS PLANNING AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL BUT- AT ALL OF THE LOCAL LEVEL SINCE THAT THREAT WILL AFFECT ALL CALIFORNIANS- WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT A ONE TIME ISSUE HAS MENTIONED IT WILL INCREASE IN SCOPE SEVERITY. AND SCALE- AND SO- PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL WE HAVE TO DO THAT BUT FUNDING PERMITTING A WOULD DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE'RE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. ASPECTS OF THOSE PLANS GOING INTO THE FUTURE. THE YOU AND IF YOU GET ALL RESPOND TO. MISTAKES BECAUSE WHICH IS WHEN I ABOUT AFTER WE- AFTER IF WE CAN IF WE COULD PREDICT THINGS. OR OR IF WE CAN EARLIER- IDENTIFY THINGS BUT THEN ARE WE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEDICATE AND I'M THINKING OF I LIVE IN A- AT THE END IN THE AREA AND IN THE DELTA WHERE WHEN IT GETS VERY HOT AND THE WATER FLOW DOESN'T FLOW R. BAR WATERS IN STREAMS GET FILLED UP WITH. ALGAE THAT IS TOXIC AND POISONOUS. AND SO THE ANNOUNCEMENT JUST EVERYONE STAY OUT OF THE WATER BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE SO WELL THEY'RE ALSO THEN BE IT FOLLOW UP WITH MEDICATION AND INTERVENTION AND BEST. PRACTICES WE WERE ABLE TO PREDICT. SOMETHING SOMETHING BAD IS GETTING READY TO HAPPEN. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND YOU'RE REALLY REFERENCING- THE PILLARS THAT DIRECTOR OUTGOING MENTIONED WHICH IS REALLY AIMING TOWARDS PREVENTION RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO JUST. COUNT HARM CALIFORNIANS FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT IT MITIGATED AND ULTIMATELY. PREVENTED THAT FOURTH PILLAR. SO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO HEAT. RIGHT NOW WHEN WE ISSUE A HEAT WARNING. THAT'S BASED ON A VERY NON PRECISE HISTORIC TEMPERATURE AVERAGES IT HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO HUMAN HEALTH. FOR ABLE TO BETTER QUANTIFY. IN A MICRO CLIMATE REGION WHEN A PARTICULAR TEMPERATURE THRESHOLD AFFECTS A PARTICULAR VULNERABLE COMMUNITY. THEN WE CAN HAVE. HEALTH RELATED HEAT WARNINGS WORK WITH THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. BE MORE PROACTIVE AND THAT'S JUST ON THE FRONT YOU MENTIONED TOXIC ALGAE BLOOMS. AND THERE'S MANY OTHER AS I MENTIONED WATER FOOD AIR FUNGAL BORN SH- CONDITIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO NOT JUST COUNT REAL TIME. BUT ULTIMATELY- PROJECT AS WELL AS MEDICAID SO. SOME OF THE STAFF BEING PROPOSED IN THIS INITIATIVE. INCLUDES FOR THE MODELING AND THE COMMUNICATION. AND THE LEARNING THAT COMES FROM THE REAL TIME INFORMATION- JUST LIKE WITH CODING YOUKNOW HAVING. SEQUENCING FOR THEIR- NEWEST VARIANT ALLOWS US TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO MITIGATE. THE SAME WOULD BE. TRUE FOR CLIMATE THREATS MOVING INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU AND I GUESS IT'S FUNNY I WOULD I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AS WE'RE DEVELOPING THESE NEW REGIONAL PLANS I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD USE INFORMATION ALREADY AVAILABLE- THERE'S- YOU KNOW. MEMBERS PASAL LOT OF BILLS THAT BECAUSE ANIMALS REALLY RIGHT I THINK WITH THAT. I WAS FROM SEVENTEEN. I MISS GARCIA PRESIDENT HAS A GROUP SET UP ALL OVER THE STATE COMMUNITY GROUPS ARE LOOKING AT AIR QUALITY AND ISSUES LIKE THAT SO. JUST MAKE SURE WE DON'T. THAT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE TASK FORCE AND COMMISSIONS AND EVERYTHING IS ALREADY SET UP OUT THERE. COLLECTING A LOT OF THIS DATA AND THAT WE'RE ABLE TO JUST- NOT NOT. NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL BUT BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THE INFORMATION THAT IS ALREADY BEING GATHERED. AND MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT WE APPRECIATE THE INPUT THAT THEY'VE ALREADY GIVEN ON A LOT OF THESE TOPICS. ABSOLUTELY AND I'LL SAY OF ALL THE PLANS THAT EXIST WHAT'S OFTEN MISSING IS THE WORD HELP. THERE'S HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS THERE'S- GENERAL PLAN UPDATES LOOKING AT CODE AND TRENDS- THERE IS. MORE BROADER PLANS LIKE SP ONE THOUSAND- THAT FOCUSES ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES BUT- WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO CENTER NOW AS AS THE U. N. SECRETARY GENERAL ISSUED A- CODE RED FOR HUMANITY WERE CALLING A CODE BLUE. ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACTS. AND REALLY PULLING ALL THOSE PLANS AND DATA FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. AT THE REGIONAL AND HOPEFULLY LOCAL LEVEL. AND I WAS JUST ALWAYS- AND I'M SURE DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS TOO IS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT. STRESS PTSD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THOSE ISSUES ARE. CAN GET INTEGRATED INTO A REGIONAL PLAN. THAT WE KNOW WHEN THINGS ARE GONNA POP. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR NAMING THAT IT'S AN EMERGING FIELD IS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ANXIETY DEPRESSION FEAR OF THE FUTURE OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AFTER EXTREME EVENTS WILDFIRE PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES- INTERACTS WITH MEDICATIONS IT INCREASES.

THE NEW NORMAL RIGHT SO- HOPEFULLY WE CAN'T WE'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE ADVANCEMENTS TO ELIMINATE HIV AND AIDS FIVE. IT STILL IN AN OF COURSE CREATING. SP TSX WHICH THE BILL I AUTHORED AND WE'LL GET DOWN THIS STD RATES AS WELL- I DID HAVE SOME. MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AROUND- THE- AROUND THE- BY A SENSE PROGRAM SO I REALIZE THAT IT'S FRAMED HERE'S CLAIM IT- BUT MY GUESS IS IT'S BROADER THAN THE UTILITY OF THIS PLATFORM IS BROADER JUST CLIMATE CHANGE. CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO WHICH IS- NATIONAL PROGRAM IT'S GREAT THAT WOULD BE JOINING THIS AND I UNDERSTAND- AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL WE ARE GOING TO- AT LEAST- WE'RE GONNA HELP SUPPORT FEES FOR SO I ASSUME ALL THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SINCE IT JUST FOURTEEN OUT OF- THAT SAID FORTY SIX OUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA HIT THE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY- PURCHASERS PARTICIPATING IN THIS AS WELL AS I GUESS- YOU HAVE OTHER FACILITIES WHILE URGING KERR'S OTHER FACILITIES- CAN YOU SPEAK TO. THE CAPACITY OF A BIOSENSOR I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT ITS ROLE CERTAINLY AN INCLINE AND HEALTH BUT IN TERMS OF OTHER TYPES OF- SO WHAT CAPACITY DOES. PROTESTING ABOUT CENTS PROVIDES STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH AND I MAY TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE DANA MOORE FROM THE CENTER OF HEALTH. STATISTICS AND INFORMATION TO TALK MORE BROADLY FROM A DATA STANDPOINT ABOUT THE MULTIPLE USE CASES AS- THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSED A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT. CLIMENT ASPECTS OF INDIAN PORTENTS OF HAVING REAL TIME INFORMATION- CERTAINLY IT'S USED AS PART OF A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE AS MISS PATRICK MENTIONED. I'M AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO PICK UP A VARIETY OF TRENDS SO WITH THE PANDEMIC WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING THAT'S A NEW INFLUENZA LIKE ILLNESS- THAT SEVEN OF TREMENDOUS INTEREST OBVIOUSLY TO BE ABLE TO. QUICKLY PICK UP NEW THREATS- SYNDROME SUBSET DRUMS IN TO BE ABLE TO SHARE DATA ACROSS STATES TO LOOK AT TRENDS ON TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S IN NEW AND EMERGING THREAT BE THAT COMMUNICABLE B. THAT ENVIRONMENTAL- AND SO THERE ARE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND HEALTH FACILITIES ACROSS THE NATION- FORTY NINE STATES- ABOUT 71% OF EMERGENCY TO HIDE AWAY IT WOULD BE. IT WOULD BE THE STATE NUMBER FIFTY THEN WE'RE THE ONLY STATE NOT PARTICIPATING. RIGHT NOW. ON NO NINE STATES FACING OKAY IS IT A STATE HAS NO FIRST. WE CURRENTLY HAVE- A FEW DOZEN FACILITIES ACROSS EIGHTEEN COUNTIES BUT THERE IS ONE STATE THAT HAS ZERO FACILITIES OKAY SO. WE ARE STILL COUNTING THE FORTY NINE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT FULLY YES WE ARE OKAY. SO REALLY THE DATA SHARING CAPACITY ACROSS COUNTY STATE AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR NEW AND EMERGING THREATS- REALLY CREATES A WIDE VARIETY OF USE CASES SOME IT CAN BE USED FOR. OPIOIDS IT COULD BE USED FOR PESTICIDES- ENVIRONMENTAL AND COMMUNICABLE BUT I'LL PASS IT TODAY ANYMORE TO SHARE A LITTLE MORE AND THAT AND I REALIZE. WE HAVE A LONG AGENDA SO WE DIDN'T EVEN VERY BRIEF AND MAYBE PROVIDE SOME MORE WRITTEN MATERIAL BUT I AM CURIOUS AS TO YOU KNOW I MEAN OF THE FRAME IS CLIMATE CHANGE BUT SELECT IS A LOT MORE WE CAN DO DISASTER RELIEF CHRONIC DISEASE SURVEILLANCE.

OKAY THANK VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER SEXUAL OR IN AND I X. FOR PILOT PROJECT THIS IS FOR A. B. TEN NINETY FOUR. ALLEGORY OF CHOICES TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR INSTEAD OF HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT A REACHING NINETY FOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY DATA COLLECTION. SILENT TESTS SUCH AS HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE ARE LEADING CAUSES OF PREMATURE DATH AND ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS OF YEARS OF LIFE LOST DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON YOUNG PEOPLE. THE GBT COMMUNITY IS AT HIGHER RISK FOR VIOLENT TEST BUT DATA ARE LIMITED ON THIS POPULATION WHICH LIMITS EFFORTS TO PREVENT THESE FAST. BRIDGING THE COLLECTING DATA. FOR A. B. TEN NINETY FOUR OF DECEDENTS AS CONSISTENT. IN A CONSISTENT MANNER IS A CRITICAL STEP IN FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE DEPTH OF THIS PROBLEM AND GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS TO PREVENT DEATHS AMONG AMONG THE. LGBTQ POPULATION. WHILE THE CALIFORNIA BILINGUE DE REPORTING SYSTEM STRUCK TO COME. THE SEXUAL. ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY DATA IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE WHEN IT'S PROVIDED SOME A PRIMARY DATA SOURCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS A ONE TIME INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND TOTAL FINDING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND IN GENERAL FUND STATE OPS AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE. TO ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER A THREE YEAR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY DATA COLLECTION PILOT PROJECT FOR A. B. TEN NINETY FOUR. THE PILOT PROJECT WILL BE AN ACTRESS SIX COUNTIES TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH C. DPH FOR TRAINING PARTNERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS. ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND COLLECTION OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER ID. DATA IN CASES OF VIOLENT DEATHS IN INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. WAS SELECTION OF AT LEAST ONE COUNTY FROM EACH OF THE NORTHERN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND CONSIDERATION OF REPRESENTATION OF URBAN RURAL AND SUBURBAN AREAS. WE EXPECT INCREASES WAIT WE EXPECT TO INCREASE PERCENTAGES OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION INFORMATION ACCURATELY COLLECTED CLOSE TRAINING. INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF COUNTY STAFF REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF THIS DATA INFORMATION. ON CD PHP REIMBURSE COUNTIES FOR THE COST TO PARTICIPATING IN TRAININGS AND IMPLEMENTING CHANGES TO CURRENT CORONER MEDICAL EXAMINER TOOLS AND SYSTEMS TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE PILOT CONTRACT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WOULD BE REMISS OF ME AS A THE VICE CHAIR OF THE LGBT CAUCUS TO NOT SAY THAT THANK YOU. THAT WE CONTINUE TO PASS BILLS THAT REQUIRE US TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION AND EVEN THOUGH. THERE'S A LOT OF OFTENTIMES REQUIREMENTS IT'S STILL NOT DONE AND SO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS- THIS ONE IS BEING DONE TO. TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE AFTER THEY HAVE DIED SO- VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE OCCURRING IN LGBTQ POPULATION. BUT AGAIN ALSO AND SOME OF THE EARLIER AREAS WE TALKED ABOUT TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE- PREDICTABLE SURVEILLANCE- AND SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN- INTEGRATE THE CHARGE SHEET INFORMATION AND SOME OF THOSE EARLIER. FACTORS AS WELL. DR THANK YOU AND I DO RECENTLY- THE WORKED ON HIM BUT I THINK IT'S THE CHAIRS MENTIONED WE'VE HAD A CHRONIC. CHRONIC PROBLEM IS EVEN UNDERSTATEMENT. A REALLY SEVERE PROBLEM WHERE- WE DON'T HAVE DATA ON THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEING COLLECTED AND I'LL SAY THAT PART OF THE FAULT OF MY OWN PROFESSION RIGHT WE THOUGHT THE DEATH CERTIFICATES AND- AND- IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO ASK THAT QUESTION- AND SO. IT DOESN'T GET ASKED SO NOTHING GETS ENTERED SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO. REACH OUT TO THE CORNERS MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND. DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET THERE YOU'LL BE MONITORING TO THE RATE OF DATA COLLECTION I MEAN THAT THAT'S REALLY THE INVITE SO IF IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ONCE ASKING A QUESTION IT DOESN'T GET INTO THE DATABASE. SO DO YOU SPEAK TO WHAT THE STRATEGIES ARE TWO. INCH TO RAISE THE- THE RATE OF DATA COLLECTION OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT FIELD- THAT- IS THE PERSONALITY OR THE WHAT THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY IS SO THAT- YOU KNOW SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. BLANK BOXES NATIONAL THESE FIELDS RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE PILOTS ALL ABOUT. MAKING SPEAK MAYBE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICALLY AS TO AND I GOT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE STAFF AND SO FORTH- ARE YOU ARE YOU WILL BE REPORTING BACK FOR EXAMPLE THIS YOU KNOW OF ALL THE DEATHS. THIS IS A PERCENTAGE THAT NEVER. HAD IT SO YOU KNOW IN. THE GENERATE AND OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION FILLED OUT ON THE DEATH CERTIFICATE FIELD. YES WE DO PLAN TO REPORT DATA TO THE BOARD O SUPERVISORS- FOR EACH YEAR OF THE PILOT PROGRAM SO WE WILL BE REPORTING THAT INFORMATION THEY SAID OKAY TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- WHAT ABOUT TWO OTHER ENTITIES THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE THAT A PRIORITY FOR THEM SO AND I GET THIS A PILOT THE ONES WHO PARTICIPATE BUT HOPEFULLY ARE TAKING THIS. TIME TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT LIKE HOW DO WE BUILD THIS MOMENTUM. TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE COLLECTING IT AND ALSO EDUCATING DOWN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ANYONE WHO FILLS OUT THERE'S A DEATH CERTIFICATE SHOULD BE ASKING A QUESTION HOW TO EDUCATE THEM TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. A GREAT YES. YOU DO HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THIS ONE- I CAN ADD. VALUE DOWN AGAIN S. ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. I THINK I'M JUST YOU KNOW WITH WITH ANY SURVEILLANCE THAT WE DO YOU KNOW WE ALREADY NOW HAVE YOU KNOW SOME BASELINE INFORMATION OF WHAT'S NOT BEING REPORTED SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK. AT YOU KNOW WHAT- WHAT'S NOT BEING RECORDED YOU KNOW WHAT BOXES AREN'T BEING CHECKED. AND THEN FOR THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE LIKE. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING DACA UPON IS. IS WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW MANY ARE NOW REPORTING RIGHT AFTER THIS PILE AFTER WEEK PROVIDED THE TRAINING AFTER WE'VE- YOU KNOW WORK WITH COUNTIES AFTER WE'VE INFORMED THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. AND SO I THINK AT THE END YOU KNOW ONCE WE'VE DONE ALL THE SURVEILLANCE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM AND HAVE THIS EVALUATION AND ALL OF THIS DATA. WE CERTAINLY WOULD DEFINITELY- CREATE RECORD OUT AND YOU KNOW. THEN THAT CAN INFORM OUR POLICYMAKERS THAT CAN INFORM OUR PROGRAMS. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE MORE EXTREME PREVENTION IT CAN HOPEFULLY PURPLE IT CAN HOPEFULLY INFORMER ACTUALLY PREVENTION EFFORTS SO. THAT'S DEFINITELY A PART OF YOU KNOW WHAT GOES INTO ALL OF. OUR SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS. NOT JUST COLLECTING BUT NOT I. THAT I HOPE YOU THE BORDER SUPER. THIS SURE THE ALSO REPORT THAT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN I'M ALSO GONNA SAY SINCE I WILL BE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THIS IS DONE BUT I WILL STILL BE A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. I HOPE YOU WILL REPORT THIS BACK TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE NEED TO NOW WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE FAILED AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO FIX THAT AND YOU GOTTA FIGURE THIS OUT THIS PILOT. SO THAT'S ONE HOPING THAT YOU'LL ALSO COME BACK TO MEDICAL TO ME SAID HEY WE HAVE SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO SHARE WITH YOU. ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO BETTER SO WE CAN DO OUR JOBS IN THAT YOU CAN ALSO DO YOUR JOBS BETTER SO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

OKAY FOR BOTH AMBIENCE YEAH THAT'S EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES WHAT'S ALL THAT TOGETHER. IN A UTILIZATION BASED ON REVENUE BUT ALSO INCREASE SCREENING TRAVELS AWAY FROM BIOCHEMICAL SCREENING MORE THAN. SEVENTY MMHM TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BECAUSE OF. YESTERDAY'S SCREENING IMPLEMENTATION WHICH WAS FUNDED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AFTER ANYTHING IN ANY OF THE PRO. I HAVE READ YOUR WORK OUTFIT TO DENY US ALL FOR THE DNA. I MEAN ALSO KNOWN AS NON INVASIVE PRENATAL SPRINGER AND I. T. T.

THANK YOU DOCTOR. NOT A BIT WELL THE UNDERSTANDABLE CERTAIN FIXED COSTS RIGHT SO THE BIRTH RATE GOES DOWN THE STREET FOR THE FIXED COSTS AND RAISE THE PER UNIT COSTS SO THE PER UNIT BECAUSE WE DID HAVE A BIG BOOM THEN THE PER UNIT COST WOULD DROP THE VX TOTAL EXPENDITURE GO UP IF MORE CASES BUT THE FIXED COSTS REMAIN THE SAME SO ANYWAY- BUT AT LEAST I DON'T HEAR SEE BIG BOOM COMING YET SO- BUT I GUESS THE I GUESS THE- LONG TERM QUESTION WE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE ARE THERE ANY OPPORTUNITIES IF. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE DECLINING BIRTHRATE. TO REDUCE OUR FIXED COSTS RIGHT NOW SO- MOTHER DOES IT. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN BASIC MEDICAL ADMIN AND SO FORTH WHAT HOW MANY SAMPLES YOU RUN BUT I MEAN I THINK- IT TO TRY TO MITIGATE FUTURE FEE INCREASES YOU KNOW. THAT THE LOOK SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE OPERATIONS IN TERMS OF FIXED COSTS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES AND- NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SO FORTH AND WHETHER CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN. ALLOW THE PER UNIT COST TO GO DOWN. BUT- IT WAS DONE SO- TYLER YES YES TWO WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN WORK THAT INTO THE EARLY DETECTION AND SURVEILLANCE. ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN AND DEALING WITH WICK PROGRAM ESTIMATES. CHRISTINE SULLIVAN DIVISION CHIEF. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON THERE IS NO GENERAL COMMENT OR WITH CASTANEDA AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ENOUGH FEDERAL FUNDS TO COVER OUR LOCAL SERVICES AND STATE OPERATIONS EXPENDITURES SHE SAYS TWO MEN INCLUDES DECREASES AND THE CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR THERE WAS A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE ACTUAL COST PER PARTICIPANT IN THE PRIOR YEAR WHICH IMPACTS OUR PROJECTIONS FOR CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR. MUCH OF THE DECREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS BEING OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN VEGETABLE BENEFITS WHICH BEGAN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND CONTINUES THROUGH MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SH BASKETBALL INCREASED MAY CONTINUE PAST MARCH ACROSS THE NATIONAL BUDGET IN THE COMING WEEKS. IN ADDITION THE ESTIMATE REFLECTS A SLIGHT DECREASE IN PROTECTED PARTICIPATION BUT WE ARE STILL MUCH HIGHER. THAN PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. I MONDAY AND THIS WEEK U. S. A. ITS LATEST THREE ON THE WORK. REACHED YOU'RE QUITE HAS PERFECT TIMING. THE LATEST REPORT IS. LOOKING AT TWENTY NINETEEN DATA. THE NATIONAL WEATHER COVERAGE RATE WAS 50% 57% OF THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION LOOKING AT TWENTY NINETEEN. WHILE CALIFORNIA'S RATE WAS 69% UP FROM 67% IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OUR CONTEXT TEXAS WHO HAS A CASELOAD OF ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR CALIFORNIA SIZE. FLORIDA HAS A CASELOAD OF ABOUT HALF OF CALIFORNIA BOTH HAVE RAISED A WITH THE HIGHEST COVERAGE RATE SOMETIMES ALTERNATING WITH VERMONT WHOSECASELOAD IS ABOUT GLAD TO KNOW THAT WE WERE GETTING UNDER DOCTOR FELT THE DA THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE LEADER IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF. GETTING ELIGIBLE PEOPLE AND HELP. YOU PROJECTING A DECREASE BUT- WELL IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE JUST DONE TUESDAY WE HEARD FROM CAL WORKS AND WE HEARD FROM CALFRESH THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING AN INCREASE- AND SOME OF THAT'S DUE TO PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE UNEMPLOYMENT SUBSIDIES GO GOING AWAY IN THE FALL AND THEN OF COURSE THE- CHILD TAX CREDIT FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT ENDED. AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. SO- SO GIVE IT THAT SO. I'M JUST SORT OF THE LIKE OKAY- SIMILAR POPULATIONS ALL THAT SOME DIFFERENCES- WELL HOW DO YOU COME OF THE DECREASE WHEN PROGRAMS LIKECALFRESH AND- CAL WORKS ARE ACTUALLY PREDICTING AN INCREASE. IN CASE LAWS. SO OUR OUR OUR PROJECTION AND DECREASES THE VERY SMALL DECREASE YES AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT INSTEAD. OF TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE SERVING ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND. INDIVIDUALS EACH. MONTH AND WE'RE UP TOWARDS OF ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND NOW SO WE DID. HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN TWENTY TWENTY MANY WEAK STATE AND I BELIEVE OTHER PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA SHE DID START TO SEE A DROP OFF IN THEIR PARTICIPATION AFTER THAT INITIAL. PANDEMIC INCREASED AND WE DID NOT WE MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVELS WITH JUST. MINOR DECREASES OUT. BUT I SO I THINK THAT THAT MADE PLAY A ROLE IN THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN AT THIS MUCH HIGHER LEVELS FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

CAN I ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU ON THIS ONE. BUT CAN. I REALLY APPRECIATE- THE- EXPANSION PROGRAM THE THINGS WE'RE LEARNING FROM THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS IN OUR HOUSES IT INDICATES FOR EXAMPLE WE LEARNED- IN THE PAST THAT- WE START WITH A ONE ON ONE AND- WE KNEW THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY WHEN YOU. GIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR- FOR WOMEN TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER ACTUALLY THAT WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ONE ON ONE ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST WAY ALONE- AND OTHERS AND CERTAINLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ELLERY KNOWLEDGE THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO GET SOME REALLY- SIX. SOME SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS IN REDUCING THE- THE RATE BUT THERE'S THE DISPARITY STILL CONTINUES AND THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN FRUSTRATING RIGHT THE DISPARITY STILL CONTINUES SO. THEY REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK WE WANT TO GET MOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE SO IN TERMS OF SIZE. LIST YOU KNOW WHAT. TO DO OTHER THINGS WERE DEFINING RELAYED THAT LEAD TO SUCCESS IN TERMS OF REDUCING.

BLACK AND WHITE BURSTING PEOPLE AND THAT DISPARITY- WE DISCOVERED THROUGH OUR INVESTIGATION. I'M ACTUALLY WIDENED WHEN YOU WHEN YOU EXPAND YOUR SCOPE FROM LOOKING OUT ARE JUST DUST UP TO FORTY THREE DAYS POSTPARTUM TO DOUSE TO ONE YEAR WE FOUND THAT ACTUALLY THE DISPARITY WIDENS. THAT WAS OUR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DATE OUT. AND SO THAT'S WHEN WE REALLY STARTED TO RAMP UP AND THANKS TO ALL OF OUR EFFORTS- ACROSS STAKEHOLDERS LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS THE SUPPORT- THE GOVERNOR IN YOURSELVES- WE IMPLEMENTED. AND EXPANDED OUR EFFORTS AROUND THIS THE BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE PERINATAL EQUITY INITIATIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH JUSTICE OUR LATEST DATA. NOW TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AGAIN WE'RE A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW WE LIKE TO BE MORE CURRENT WE'RE DOING AS FAST AS WE CAN SHOW THAT WE HAVE NARROWED THAT WE'RE STARTING TO BRING THAT DOWN WE'RE STARTING TO NARROW THAT DIFFERENCE IN MATERNAL MORTALITY AND THAT WE'RE MOVING YOU KNOW THAT'S A GOOD TREND FROM SEPT. IN HOPE THAT THAT PROCESS BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALLY HONEST AND I'M HONEST ABOUT THIS EVERYWHERE IS THAT THIS IS A RECALCITRANT YEAH THAT WILL REQUIRE ON NOT ONLY ARE AND IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM TO ADDRESS ON A LOT OF I'M DOING TO TERMS OF. SOCIAL POLICIES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED SO- WE'RE WORKING ON IT WE WERE STARTING TO SEE SOME PROGRESS IN IN TERMS OF VALUATION WE'RE DOING ONGOING EVALUATION OF THE B. H. PROGRAM WE HAVE A LOGIC MODEL WE IDENTIFIED SOME INTERMEDIARY MEASURES THAT WE WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT WE THOUGHT BASED ON THE RESEARCH WHAT THAT LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES. AND OUR EVALUATION DID SHOW THAT WE WERE ACHIEVING OUR INTERMEDIARY. MAJOR SO WE HAVE. I INCREASED OUR CALL. IN THE BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM. THIS GROUP BASED INTERVENTION MODEL. MATED IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMMUNITIES- THIS IS GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS BUT AGAIN WE'RE NOT ALONE IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US DOING A LOT OF WORK TO REDUCE THIS BUT IT IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US. THANK YOU ONE DAY AND THE ANSWER YOU YOU KNOW AND- TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT NO IT'S NOT THAT OLD NOW WHAT WHAT ELSE SOMEONE BECOMES PREGNANT.

ADULT WHO IS EXISTING BEFORE THEY GOT PREGNANT AND THEN IT'S GOING TO IMPACT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS DURING PREGNANCY AS WELL SO THAT THE INTERVENTIONS CAN'T HAPPEN JUST DURING PREGNANCY ARE MERELY A- PREGNANCY. WE USE THE LIFE COURSE FRAMEWORK RIGHT. AND THAT WE'VE FOCUSED NOT ONLY JUST ON RISK REDUCTION THROUGHOUT THE LIFE COURSE BEEN RESILIENCY PROMOTION.

KOURNIKOVA 1972% OF OUR LONG TERM CARE COMPLAINTS ARE BEING COMPLETED TIMELY AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- THERE'S A THERE'S A REDIRECTION OF FOCUS ON. BIDDING TOWARDS INFECTION CONTROL ACTIVITIES. WE WERE INVESTIGATING IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY COMPLAINTS AS HIGH PROFILE. INSTANCES BUT- RESPONSIVENESS FOR CONGRESS FUNNY TRUE COMPLETE TYPING THIS DIDN'T DECLINE DURING THIS PERIOD OF PANDEMIC. HOWEVER I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT. AFFECTED APRIL TWENTY ONE OF.

THE SKETCHES ARE NEWER NEWER COMPLAINTS COMING. IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS OF WHAT I JUST PRESENTED ALL GO AHEAD AND TURN TOWARD THE STREETS. WELL I GUESS BUT I MEAN I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY YOU'VE YOU'VE HAD A PORT SO A LOT OF OPEN CASES RIGHT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING IN THE NEWS ABOUT ABOUT SKILLED FACILITIES AND THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. AND SO WHEN YOU SAY YOU HAVE ALMOST A 15% VACANCY RATE AND I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO FILL THAT BUT- WHAT. WHAT WHAT'S THE BRIDGE PLAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE ALL. I MEAN AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE MOST SERIOUS ONES ARE DEALT WITH QUICKLY. BUT WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HUGE BACKLOG AND THE LACK OF STAFF TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT YOUR FUNCTIONS. YOU COMPLETELY AGREE AND WE AND YOU KNOW THIS IS AN EFFORT TO THE CENTER HAS LONG SINCE ONE INSURE DRIVE IN TWO WEEKS WHEN THERE'S THAT MANY ON THE REPORT SAYS YOU MAY WELL KNOW. THROUGH THE YEARS ABOUT CAR TIMING US OF INVESTIGATIONS AND SO AS WE MENTIONED. DURING A YEAR OR SO AGO WE REALLY DEVICE IMPLANTED TO TRACK MONITOR AND SHE WILL BRING FOR OUR TIMING WAS OVER MEDICATIONS AND GET INTO THE- THOSE SERVICE STATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN LINGERING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND SO. MY SURE BASIC AND WANTED. AND BUNDLING COMPLAIN YOU KNOW TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU GO INTO A BUILDING. YOU KNOW JUST DOING THE MOST IMMEDIATE COMPLAINT THAT YOU HAVE TRUSTED TAKING THREE OR FOUR WAS THAT OUR OLDER- PROTESTATIONS THAT SO WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS AND I THINK THAT OUR DATA SHOWS THAT WE ARE. REALLY DIVING INTO OUR BACKYARD COMPLAINTS. WE HOPE TO. YOU KNOW HAVE THESE RESULT. THE NEAR TERM A- WE GET ANOTHER NUMBER TO A LOT OF COMPLAINTS AND TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESS WORLD. UPWARDS OF TWENTY THOUSAND EACH YEAR SO WE ARE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO BE CURRENTLY ON OUR CURRENT COMPLAINTS. WILL ALSO HAVE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT WE NEED TO GET INTO THOSE AGING COMPLAINTS AND RESOLVE THE FOUR COMPLAINTS. SO I THINK THEY WERE FIGHTING BOTH FRONTS. I'M PRETTY WELL- HER VACANCIES YEAH WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE. YOUR EFFORTS TO HIRE NURSES SOMETIMES THAT WE ARE COMPETING WITH INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY IN THE TORAH CODE WERE YOU KNOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR A NURSE TO COME TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SERVICE BUT THE SELLERS ARE SURE THAT WE HAVE AND SO WE HAVE SOMECOMPETITION- BUT WE ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO HIRE RESULT IN HIRING AND ONBOARDING TRAINING OVER NEW NURSES- STARTED- GOT MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE TRYING TO. UTILIZE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. TO HELP US. TO COMPLETE THIS. WERE TRAINED OPERATE SO THAT TO ME. SCHEDULE PROCESSES WHICH WERE MOSTLY WHEN WE ARE NOT ALL THE KINKS WILL ALLOW US TO DO THOSE COMPLAINTS FASTER. SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS OF STREAMLINING ANYMORE FISHER WELL OUR STAFF. WHILE WE STILL HIRE THOSE PEOPLE TO DO OUR ONGOING COURSE CERTAINLY WORKS FOR RECERTIFICATION. AND CAN RELAX FOR. THANK YOU AND A DIFFICULT A DIFFICULT DR OKAY. THANK YOU AND- AND I KNOW THERE'S MANY AUDITS AND I BELIEVE- THE FED SEVERAL HEARINGS ON THIS PARTICULAR ASSEMBLY SIDE BUT- SO KEY. THE TERMS IF YOU DIDN'T MENTION DO YOU HAVE A VACANCY OF ABOUT 15% FORTY POINT 7% WHAT'S THE TURNOVER RATE. FOR YOUR FOR YOUR NURSES SO WHAT PERCENTAGE IN EACH YEAR ARE YOU. LOSING AND THEN TAKE IT SO. SO WITH THAT TURNOVER RATE HOW MUCH WE CAN GET YOU I CAN GET YOU THE HISTORICAL DATA I DON'T HAVE IT HERE BEFORE ME I KNOW THAT WE'RE TRACKING IT- I WANT TO SAY. MEMORY OUR TURNOVER RATE SEEMS TO BE AROUND FOUR OR 5% FOR A NURSE. SO THAT WAS. BASICALLY KEEPING WITH WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A HEALTHY WORKFORCE RIGHT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT HAS BEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. I KNOW THAT WE ARE TRACKING THAT DATA SO. IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME I WILL PROVIDE THE DATA. AFTERWARDS TRUE THE COMMITTEE STAFF- ON OUR TURNOVER RATES FOR NURSES. AT ANY IS OBVIOUSLY BEING A NURSE INSPECTOR IS A SPELL IT'S NEEDED STAPLE IN THE NURSERY I MEAN THERE'S VERY SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR THIS FOR THEM TO BE AN EFFECTIVE- LAST YEAR SO IT'S A- ONE TO ONE LEAVES YOU. KNOW THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO BRING SOMEONE UP TO SPEED RIGHT. EXACTLY SO ARE YOUR NORMAL NURSING EDUCATION TO BE IN. A NURSING. HOME INSPECTORS EXACTLY. I'M STILL IN CONCERT TO. NOT SHORT TERM. ON BY OUR NURSE NURSE. WHO HAVE TO LEARN THE MYRIAD NUMBERS OF REGULATIONS BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE. AND HOW TO APPLY THEM AND DO THE INVESTIGATION THAT WILL STAND THE TEST OF A CHALLENGE FROM A FACILITY OR COURT. IF YOU GET TO COURT. SO IT'S A VERY TOUGH JOB THAT WE HAVE FOR NURSES TO PERFORM. ONCE THE TRAIN WE DO WE HAVE TRUNCATED THREE YEARS OF SOME OF THE PANELISTS. AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD. OF YOU'RE FREE WE HAVE. REALLY TRIED TO TRY. OUR TRAINING PROGRAM. AND PROVIDE. SPECIALTY TRAINING THROUGHOUT THE YEARS TO UNDERSTAND SO THEY CAN GET UP AND RUNNING FASTER. AND TO HELP US GET INTO RECORD THESE TAKE US A LONG TIME FOR US TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE TRAINING PROCESS GOING ON THE DOWN TO MAYBE A SIX WEEK. TRAINING PROGRAM. AND SO. GREENLIT TRYING THEM OUT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOES TAKE A VERY SPECIALIZED PERSON TO KNOW HOW TO DO THAT INVESTIGATIVE. TECHNIQUES HOW TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO KNOW WHERE TO LOOK IN THE RECORDS FOR THE FINDINGS. AND THEN TO DIG DEEPER SO. IT'S NOT AN EASY JOB- BUT WE HAVE A DEDICATED WORKFORCE AND I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE AND HAPPY THAT I ASSOCIATE WITH THE PROGRAM RIGHT WELL TYLER I THINK FROM AN HR STANDPOINT THINKING ABOUT BY- THAT'S WHY IT'S ASKING THE TURN HELLO- UNDER SORT OF ALTERNATIVE WORK ARRANGEMENTS SO THAT YOU CAN. RETAIN PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY'RE SO THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU TRAIN THEM DO YOU HAVE A SPECIALIZED POOL RIGHT SO HOW DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM. EVEN ONES WHO MADE DECIDED WHY DO THAT FULL TIME ARTS CENTER BUT I JUST THINK THAT THAT BUT THE I GUESS THE NEXT QUESTION IS THAT. HE DID MENTION THAT PRIOR TO COPE WITH THAT YOU'RE ON TIME RATE WAS 72% AND THEN IT PROBABLY WENT DOWN IT'S HOPEFULLY YOU'RE GETTING IT BACK BUT- I HAVE TO SAY IF YOU'RE 72% I'M THINKING LIKE OH WELL THAT MEANS OWN YOU KNOW. OVER A QUARTER OF ALL COMPLAINTS ARE NOT ON TIME YOU KNOW DEALT WITH ON TIME- IS THERE A GOAL TO GET THAT HIGHER AND WHAT SHOULD BE THE NORMAL HON TIME- AND INSTIGATION I REALIZE SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY YOU KNOW. SO IT'S A 100% I MEAN REALISTICALLY EIGHT SEVENTY TWO STILL SOUNDS LIKE IT'S- FAIRLY LOW AND THAT MAYBE SHOULD WE BE DOING NEED MORE PEOPLE SO WE CAN. SO WE HAD A HIGHER TARGET. SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE. ON TIME INVESTIGATION RIGHT. CHECK YOUR PREMIER TO SPOT. WELL I AM BUT I MEAN THAT BUT SOMEONE'S LOOK AT SEVEN TO GET UPSET I GONNA BE BECAUSE- AS IT IS NOT TO BE A HIGH. PERCENT BUT- THEY DON'T. I HAD. 2% YOU'RE FROM. WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME CHRIS HAS. OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO BE- YOU KNOW REALISTICALLY I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE WERE IN THE HIGH EIGHTY PERCENTILE FOR ONLINE I'M CIRCLING TIMING DECISIONS. PRETTY DARN GOOD WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT SOME OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS WILL REQUIRE MORE EFFORT TRUE. TRUE OR DO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. YOU MIGHT NEED IT WE MIGHT NEED TO GO TO A HOSPITAL OR SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO MAY BE ON VACATIONS TO GET THAT FINAL INTERVIEW WE MAY NEED FOUR CORNERS REPORT US THERE'S A DEATH INVOLVED. SO YOU YOU GIVE HER THE HIGH EIGHTIES. EARLIER CRITIC YOUR METRICS PRESS THE START. DO WE NEED MORE POSITIONS. YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS A TOUGH QUESTION AND IMPOVERISHMENT DOES DO THAT IRISH EACH YEAR RIGHT SO PART OF IT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IS COME BACK LET'S SAY SURE SAY. HERE'S OUR WORKLOAD HERE'S- HERE'S OUR BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS CHOOSE THE POSITIONS THAT WE NEED. TO GO FOR. THE FACT THAT WE ARE MAKING PRETTY STRONG- REDUCTIONS IN OUR COMPLAINT BACKLOG WHICH DOES HE DIDN'T SURE HOW MANY POSITIONS THAT WE NEED. WHAT ARE YOU FOR THE FACT THAT WE MAYBE TEMPERING OUT IN YEARS TO COME RIGHT. SO IF WE HAVE A. 14% VACANCY RATE. IF YOU GET DOWN 2% ZERO EIGHT FOUR ORDERS WE GET THE- WHILE WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN. CON DIVING INTO OUR OUR BACK ON YOUR CLIENTS. YOU KNOW I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT WILL BE NEXT YEAR NEXT YEAR WE MIGHT BE. A LITTLE HIGHER ON THAT. ON TIME COMPLETION RATE- SO AS WE AS I MENTIONED EVERY. YOU KNOW WRAP UP THOSE OLD COMPLAINTS THAT MEANS THAT STAFF CANNOT TRAIN TO NEW COMPLAINTS SO I CAN'T PREDICT BUT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE S. BUT THAT'S A PERSONAL COMMITMENT IS THE SUREST TOTELL YOU KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT WITH OUR WORK WHAT LOOKS LIKE. OKAY SO IT IS CRUCIAL OKAY SO OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT MY FIRST TIME AROUND THIS RODEO SO FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT BACK WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE THERE WAS AN ISSUE AND THEN TURNED OUT SOMEONE HAD TO DO WITH HOW THEY CLOSED OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS AND SO FORTH AND SOME OF THE PROCESS IS OVER SO YES IT'S NOT ALL THAT'S RIGHT THE WORK FORCE SO THIS COULD BE YOU KNOW AS A NUMBER OF POSITIONS THAT. PEOPLE YOU KNOW NOT SIMPLIFYING DATA ON TIME ARE YOU HAVING DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE DATA TOOK BILL COMPLETE INVESTIGATION ETCETERA BUT WHAT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO US SO WHAT WORKS FOR YOUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IS AND- WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE STOPPING YOU FROM GETTING TO THE OTHER DAY FOR EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE IS A NUMBER OF POSITIONS IS IT DO WE HAVE TO TURN TO THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND SAID GUESS WHAT WE NEED SOME LEGISLATION GIVE YOU MORE OF A HAMMER TO GET THE DATA YOU NEED ON TIME TO CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION ON THE TIMELY MANNER IT'S ADDRESS SO THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS IS. ALWAYS GOING TO BE HELPFUL TO US SO WE CAN HELP YOU BUT WHEN YOU'RE NOT AT THAT UP 480% OR WHATEVER- AND I KNOW I PUT YOU ON THE SPOT TO SAY WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA SAY SO WHAT DO YOU NEED IF YOU DON'T COME BACK AND TELL US THIS IS THE THING THAT WE NEED YOU WE NEED YOUR HELP AND TO GET IT AND WHEN I SAY WELL WHY AREN'T YOU THERE SO- IF WE SEE YOUR YOUR STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS AND YOUR ANSWERS AND I CERTAINLY KNOW DURING COVE IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. AS WELL- BUT THEM PLEASE HELP US HELP YOU BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO IS SO VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND WE WANNA BE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS YOU NEED TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO- WITH THAT AGAIN APPRECIATE IT BUT LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING SOME MORE INFORMATION FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT SETS ARE ALL YOU ARE THE US CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY SO WE WANTED TO BE SURE WE'RE. HITTING THE QUALITY THAT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DESERT. THANK YOU SIR. WE SOLICIT. THOSE RECENTLY FROM SISTER SO. AGAIN WE- THAT. UNDER YEAR ON FOR THE NEXT TWO ISSUES.

FROM THE LISTINGS OR KITCHEN FUND FOR EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO EXTENDED AUGMENT THE DEPARTMENT'S HEALTH CARE FACILITY CERTIFICATION CONTRACT WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY- THIS MONEY IS TO. ACCOUNT FOR INDIRECT COSTS INCLUDE BENEFIT RAISING PERSONAL COSTS AND THESE COSTS HAVE INCREASED. THIS WOULD BE A ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT THREE YEAR CONTRACT.

CHARACTER THIS IS LOCATED THERE- THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR JUNE THIRTIETH CONCLUDES OUR THREE YEAR CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE HAD IN PLACE. THEY WERE ASKING FOR A ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF THAT THIRD YEAR OF THE CONTRACT WHILE WE CONTINUE TO BUILD BUILD ANOTHER BRIDGE OUT FROM OUR CALL AND RESPONSE- ENTERPRISE TIME TO NEGOTIATE ANOTHER THREE YEAR CONTRACT WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY PRETTY HARD AND WE HAD TO PIVOT FROM OUR NORMAL WORK FLOW TO CODE RESPONSE WORKERS SCHOOLERS IF LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OR SO- WE DIDN'T HAVE STRONG METRICS TO SEE HOW WELL LOS ANGELES COUNTY WAS PERFORMING. THROUGH THEIR CORE WORKLOAD- THE LAST TWO YEAR CONTRACT TO PROVIDE. US I THINK INCREASE AND FUNDING FOR ALL THE COUNTY. FOR THEM TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF GOING TO TRAIN THEM TO DO OUR CORE WORKLOAD AND WHAT WE HAVE UNTIL SHE COULD SEE. HOW WELL THEY WILL PERFORM IN A POST PANDEMIC WORLD SO AS WE BUILD OUT THIS YEAR AND RETURN TO A NORMAL WORK- WE WILL WE'LL GET A SENSE ABOUT HOW THEY ARE PERFORMING- AND WE'LL USE THAT INFORMATION OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS OR SO.
