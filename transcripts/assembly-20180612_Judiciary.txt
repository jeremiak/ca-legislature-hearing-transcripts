SO WE WILL TAKE YOU UP NOW AND THAT IS OUR ITEM FOR. WHICH IS SJR SIXTEEN. JOIN THE AUTHORED BY SENATORS WILK AND HUESO. SIR THANK MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. NOT BEHALF OF MYSELF AND CENTER BEN HUESO I'M PRESENTING AS J. R. SIXTEEN CALLING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EXTEND THE TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR RESIDENTS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF EL SALVADOR. HAITI HONDURAS NICARAGUA IN THE SUDAN. LAST DECEMBER I MET WITH A GROUP OF SALVADORANS FROM MY DISTRICT REGARDING AT THAT TIME THE PENDING EXPIRATION OF THE OF THE TPS PROGRAM. AND THEIR STORIES REALLY MOVE ME I HAD ONE CONSTITUENT. HER FAMILY FLED DURING THE CIVIL WAR SHE SHE LEFT AL SALVADOR AYE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AT THE AGE OF EIGHT. I CAME HERE. TO THIS COUNTRY. QUALIFY FOR THE TPS PROGRAM HER AND HER HUSBAND. THEY MARRIED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX. BOTTA BOUGHT A HOME TOGETHER NO FOUR IN THAT NOW THEY HAVE TWO ADULT CHILDREN THEIR ELDEST DAUGHTERS TWENTY SIX HAS A CAREER THEIR SON IS STILL IN COLLEGE AT THE AGE OF. TWENTY AND ONE THING SHE DID SHE BEAMED WITH PRIDE TELL ME HOW THEY CAME HERE ON THEIR OWN NEVER ACCEPT ANYTHING FROM THE GOVERNMENT. WANTED TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN AS. MOST AMERICANS DO IN YOU KNOW LIKE SO MANY TPS HOLDERS THEY WERE DEVASTATED. WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW CANCELED. A TPS FOR SALVADORANS AND THEIR FRIEND ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR ADULT CHILDREN. AS WELL AS GOING BACK TO COUNTRY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WOULD NOPE NO WHERE TO LIVE NO PROSPECTS FOR EMPLOYMENT IN MOST OF ALL THE FEAR THE VIOLENCE GANGS AND POLITICAL UNREST THAT STILL. OCCURS THERE. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IT'S ALSO TERMINATED THE TPS PROGRAM FOR HAITI NICARAGUA AND SUDAN. AND LAST MONTH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THE END OF THE TPS PROGRAM FOR CURRENT HONDURAS WHICH IS THE SECOND LARGEST GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT FROM THIS OP PROTECTED STATUS. TBS HOLDERS HAVE ALREADY FULFILLED MANY THEIR CORE REQUIREMENTS FOR LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS EVERYDAY THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY BECOME FULL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THROUGH EMPLOYMENT. HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE RAISING OF THEIR CHILDREN AS MY PRIOR STORY OF MY CONSTITUENT ILLUSTRATES. TOGETHER AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXTEND TPS FOR ALL MEMBERS FROM ALL THESE COUNTRIES WHILE ALSO WORKING TOWARD A PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR RESIDENCIES. FOR THESE RESIDENTS THIS BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION IS COMMITTED TO OUR SHARED VALUES OF JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS AND PROTECTING OUR TPS. HOLDERS OUT OF WHO WANTED LIVE IN AMERICA AND EMBRACE OUR IDEALS SO WITH THAT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. ANYONE WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION.

UPSET ABOUT YOUR. YOU'RE HIDING IN THE CORNER YOU'RE NOT ONE WHO TYPICALLY HIDES SO WE'LL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO S. B. TEN FIFTY THREE. ALRIGHT GREATS. MORNING WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR. THIS FINE DAY. I PRESENTING. SP. TEN FIFTY THREE IF I COULD. AW THIS BILL IS A CLARIFICATION OF EXISTING LAW. THAT PROTECTS VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE. IT'S EQUIVOCATION NOT REALLY A CHANGE IN THE LAW. NOW THE GOVERNMENT TOWARDS A CLAIMS ACT REQUIRES A CLAIMS RELATED TO DEATH FOR INJURY. MUST BE PRESENTED NO LATER THAN SIX MONTHS. AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. SANSA CASES INVOLVING CHILD ABUSE ARE DISTINCT IN NATURE. THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SP SIX FORTY. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. EXEMPTING CASES OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE FROM THE TORT CLAIMS PROCESS. MORE TIME IS ALLOWED BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA LATE DISCOVERY OF ABUSE BY A PARENT OR GUARDIAN. OR THE CHILDREN NOT TELLING ANYONE. EXPERTS ESTIMATE THAT ONE OF FOUR GIRLS AND ONE SIX BOYS. WILL BE SEXUALLY ABUSED BEFORE THEIR EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY. AUTUMN LESSON ONE IN TEN ACTUALLY TO TELL ABOUT IT. SO THE LEGISLATURE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS. AND ESTABLISH S. B. SIX FORTY. THAT THAT. IT WAS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THE CLAIM WILL ALWAYS BE FILED SIX MONTHS. AFTER THE ACTUAL ABUSE OCCURS WITH THE CHILD UNITS YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S. KIND OF OFF LOGICAL. LEGISLATIVE COMPS QUICKLY VERSION. AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. YET THERE'S BEEN MANY CASES HANDLED IN WAYS THAT WERE NOT IN WITHIN THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. AN SP. TEN FIFTY THREE CLARIFIES THAT VICTIMS. WHO COULD SPEAK UP SOONER WILL DO SO LATER? THE BILL IS AIMED AT PROTECTING THE CIVIL LEGAL RIGHTS. OF THOSE INJURED THROUGH CHILD SECTION CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE ALLOWING THEM. TO SEEK COMPENSATION FOR PUBLIC OR PRIVATE AND HE'S INVOLVED. WE HAVE SOME WITNESSES EITHER TURN THEM OVER TO THE WITNESSES MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION THIS MONKEY CENTER TALK FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. HELLO GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CASSANDRA IDEAS I AM A CURRENT JUNIOR AT CAL LOLLIPOP CAL POLY POMONA. MY LIFE WAS CHANGED FOREVER WHEN I WAS A YOUNGER ON THE THIRD GRADE MAYFAIR TEACHER WAS MISTER BURNS. MISTER BERMAN ME FEEL SPECIAL YOU MAY BELIEVE I WAS HIS FAVORITE STUDENT AND HE EVEN GIVE ME A NICKNAME LUCKY. HE WAS A VERY POPULAR TEACHER AND EVEN GAIN THE TRUST OF MY FAMILY. DIGGING MY CHOSE TO THE POINT WHERE I AM BACK INTO SEVERAL PRETTY PARTY'S. AS A THIRD GRADER IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SIX SCHOOL YEAR I COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN AS BEING GROOMED AND APPEARS. BUT IT WASN'T JUST ME MISTER BARRETT ABUSE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. ARE CHILDREN. ITS HARD TO DESCRIBE BUT I WILL BE BRIEF. MR BURR PLAYED A GAME OF THE THIRD GRADERS HE TOOK US INTO A BOOK HE TOOK US BOTH IN INDIVIDUALLY AND AS GROUPS TO THEIR CLASSROOM. HE WOULD COVER THE WINDOWS AND CLOSE THE DOORS. HE WOULD THEN PLAY A TASTING GAME WHERE HE WOULD PUT SUGAR ON COOKIES AND HE WOULD HAVE A SEAT THE COOKIES ARE HE PHOTOGRAPHED US. THE SUGAR WAS ACTUALLY MIX WITH MISTER BYRD STING SEAMAN. HE ALSO SPOON FED SEMEN TO CHILDREN AS WELL WHILE TAKING PICTURES AND OTHER OCCASIONS MISTER BERT WOULD HAVE CHILDREN TIE HIM UP IN A CHAIR TO SIMULATE EROTIC BONDAGE. MR BURR WAS NOT A RESIDENTIAL FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT SIX YEARS AFTER I LEFT HIS CLASS. IT WAS THEN THAT IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THIS TAKE TASTE TESTING GAME. HAD AN EVIL AND THE PURPOSE. THERE IS NO WAY WE COULD HAVE MANY SIX MONTH FILING DEADLINE FROM THE DATE OF THE LAST MONTH STATION AS WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE WERE BEING ABUSED UNTIL SIX YEARS LATER. AFTER HIS ARREST BECAME PUBLIC I FELT SO DISGUSTED BETRAYED INTO SIVA MISTER BURNS AND NEED A MONTH ALIMENTARY. I LOST ANY SENSE OF TRUST IN ADULTS AND HAD A SEVERE LOSS OF APPETITE I HAD PROBLEMS BEING ALONE AND. BEING ABLE TO SLEEP. I WAS LATER DIAGNOSED WITH PTSD THIS IS VERY COMMON WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN AS WELL. WE LATER LEARNED THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FAILED TO TAKE ACTION ON MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS AGAINST MISTER BURN. YEARS EARLIER INCLUDING COMPLAINS THAT HE WAS SEEN* AGAINST ON BEHIND HIS DOES AND REPORTS OF HIM HAVING HIS HANDS DOWN HIS PANTS I RECESS. THIS GROSS ABUSE COULD HAVE BEEN LONG PREVENTION. OUR KIDS IS IMPORTANT NOT TO GIVE KIDS LIKE ME TOOLS TO SEEK THERAPY BUT ALSO TO MAKE A SOCIAL CHANGE. BECAUSEOF OUR CASE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY FOR EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT WAS ENFORCE ANY REVEAL THE EMPLOYEE FILES GOING BACK DECADES WAS ORDERED IN AN EFFORT TO RID THE DISTRICT OF POTENTIAL PROBLEM EMPLOYEES. THE LAW NEEDS TO PROTECT KIDS LIKE ME S. B. TEN FIFTY THREE DOES THAT BY CONFIRMING THE EXISTING LAW FEASIBLE A. THANK YOU BEST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS HOLLY BOYER. RECOGNIZING THE UNIQUE NATURE OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE CASES THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AMENDED CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE THREE FORTY POINT ONE. TO EXTEND THE PERIOD WITHIN WHICH A VICTIM OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE MUST FILE INACTION. WELL THE EXTENDED PROTECTIONS OF SECTION THREE FORTY POINT ONE. WERE INTENDED TO EXTEND TO ALL VICTIMS WHETHER THEIR INJURIES AROSE FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ENTITIES. THE LAW WAS NOT SO APPLY. INTO THOUSAND SEVEN THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED SHIRK VERSUS VISTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FINDING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE. OR ELSEWHERE RELIEVING A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE FROM HAVING TO COMPLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS ACT. CORD HIGHLIGHTED THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED FOR ALL VICTIMS TO BE TREATED THE SAME. AND AFFORDED THE EXTENDED PROTECTIONS OF THREE FORTY POINT ONE IT COULD HAVE SAID SO AND IT DIDN'T. THE LEGISLATURE RESPONDED. WITHIN MONTHS OF THE SHARK DECISION AND WITH FULL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. SENATE BILL SIX FORTY PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. CREATING SUBDIVISION M. TO SECTION NINE ALL FIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE. LIKELY EXEMPTING VICTIMS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE FROM HAVING TO FILE TORT CLAIMS. DESPITE THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECT ACTION IN RESPONSE TO SHIRK. SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE NOW ATTEMPTED TO CIRCUMVENT SUBDIVISION THEM BY AN ACTING THEIR OWN LOCAL REGULATION. IMPOSING A CLAIM FILING REQUIREMENT ON THESE VICTIMS. THESE LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE RELYING ON A FLAWED INTERPRETATION OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION NINE THIRTY FIVE TO JUSTIFY THIS ABSOLUTE DISREGARD FOR THE INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE. SENATE BILL TEN FIFTY THREE CODIFIES AND CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW THAT PROTECTS VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE. FROM THE ONEROUS GOVERNMENT CLAIM PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS. THINKING. THANK YOU GOTTA TAKE A PAUSE ESTABLISH A QUORUM PLEASE STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM. CHAU. CHIU HOLDEN KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN THERE REYES. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. YOU HAVE A CORE SO THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE. KIND OF VALENTINE FROM CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION IN FULL SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING NANCY PERINEUM WE HAVE THE CONSUMER TRAYS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL THINKING. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE THEIR OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MR WHERE MEMBERS FAVORING Y. JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT PARROT THE RADIUS. IN VERY RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION OF THE SPELL. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES PUBLIC AGENCIES WERE FACED WITH EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SECTOR INSURANCE COSTS THAT PROVIDED VERY LITTLE COVERAGE. AND MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE UNWILLING OR VERY RELUCTANT TO PROVIDE INSURANCE PRODUCTS TO PUBLIC AGENCIES. THE PUBLIC ENTITY RISK PULLING JP IS WHERE ESTABLISH AND AS A RESULT MANY PUBLIC AND EIGHTY IS INCLUDING MORE THAN A THOUSAND SCHOOL. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS USE THIS MODEL TO EFFECTIVELY SELF INSURE FOR LIABILITY AND OTHER INSURANCE. OBLIGATIONS AND NONPROFIT RISK POOLS. WHERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL WHICH ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN THE RECENT APPELLATE COURT HOLDING AND BIGELOW FLAT GROVELING UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT VERSES THE SUPERIOR COURT? WHERE THE COURT REASONED THAT GOVERNMENT TOWARD? CLAIMS ACT REQUIREMENT OF PRE LAWSUIT NOTICE AFFORDS A PUBLIC ENTITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO PROMPTLY REMEDY ACCLAIM BEFORE INCURRING THE COSTLY EXPENSIVE GOING TO ACQUIRE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A TIMELY INVESTIGATION WERE TANGIBLE EVIDENCE IS STILL AVAILABLE AND MEMORIES ARE FRESH AND ALLOWS THE PUBLIC AND EIGHTY TO PROPERLY BUDGET THE EXPENSE. THIS COMMITTEE TYPICALLY DOES NOT ENCOURAGE LOGICALLY XIN WHERE THERE IS ONGOING LITIGATION AND THIS CASE HAS BEEN APPEALED TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. CATCH UP OF FULLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND RESPECTS THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. STORY WE JUST HEARD IS TRULY HEARTBREAKING AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INSTANCES. ARE LIMITED AND NEVER HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGITIMATE CLAIMS BEING PRESENTED AND ADDRESSED. IT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO WITH THESE CLAIMS PROCEDURES. TO DENY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC ENTITIES THE RIGHT TO PROMPTLY RECEIVE PRE LAWSUIT NOTICE AND INVESTIGATE INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS EARLY. HURTS NOT ONLY THE PARTIES INVOLVED BUT THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER WHO ULTIMATELY BEARS THE COST OF THESE LAWSUITS AND IT ALSO HURTS THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO RELY ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES THAT ARE RESTRICTED AS A RESULT. I REALIZE THAT IT PRESENTED A FISCAL CONCERN BUT BECAUSE THAT THAT WAS NOT TIGHT FISCAL I HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO PRESENT THOSE CONCERNS TO YOU HERE TODAY. AND RESPECTFULLY HAD STATE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SAY NOT I WANNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATE WHEN I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US FOR THAT THIS COMMITTEE ALSO IS. USUALLY VERY HIGHLY CRITICAL OF. LEGISLATION IN THE MIDST OF LITIGATION BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS CLARIFY WHAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED IN. IN THIS AND PROVIDES A BETTER INSTRUCTIONS TO THE COURTS AS THEY MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS. AND I THINK THIS BILL IS IT ABSOLUTELY WORTHY OF OF SUPPORT AND CASSANDRA I JUST WANT TO SAY AND I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO COME AND TESTIFY IN A HEARING LIKE THIS. THAT WAS VERY BRAVE AND BUT IT. I CAN UNDERSCORE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT YOUR WILLINGNESS TO COME FORWARD AND TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS AND WHAT YOU WENT. WENT THROUGH TO HELP US AS WE WAY. THE PROS AND CONS OF OF POLICY AND IN THE END TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT. THAT THE LAWS WE PASS HAT ON INDIVIDUALS THAT ESPECIALLY KIDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. BEING WILLING TO COME FORWARD. AND WHAT ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE. THE DRESS. AND THE OPPOSITION I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU. ARE BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT IT WAS. IF FISCAL. RESPONSE TO SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH OUR POLICY. WE WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO PROTECT CHILDREN. WHO ARE VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD ABUSE AND OF THE FACT THAT? WE'RE GIVING THEM SIX MONTHS. WE KNOW FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH THE. GOING BACK TO THE ME TO MOVEMENT AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. THAT ONE YEAR IS NOT ENOUGH. IF WE'RE SAYING SIX MONTHS IS WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCY WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. AND SANDRA. I TO WANT TO THANK YOU YOU IT IS AN HONOR TO MEET YOU TO KNOW OF YOUR SUCCESS. TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BECOME A VOICE SO MANY WHO ARE VOICELESS. YOUR YOUR BEING HERE TODAY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND CONGRADULATIONS ADEPT AT CAL POLY GREAT INSTITUTION. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. BUT I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THINK YOU CENTER OF COMING AND SPEAKING I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE A BILL THAT ADDRESSES SOMEWHERE ISSUES. MOVING FORWARD AT I TRULY BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IT IS NOT JUST REMEDY IN WHAT WHAT WENT WRONG IN THE PAST BUT. PREVENTING WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK UNTIL WE HOLD PUBLIC ENTITIES ACCOUNTABLE THE SAME WAY WE WOULD A PRIVATE INSTITUTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. UNFORTUNATELY TO SEE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHER FOLKS TURN A BLIND EYE TO TO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS AND I I DON'T THINK THAT'S. HOW WE PROTECT CHILDREN SO? THANK YOU CENTER BALANCE IF POSSIBLE I'D LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. YOU BRING. OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SCOTT CO AUTHOR THANKS FOR BRING IT FOR. YOU. SENATE MIKLOS JUST THE DAWN. YOU KNOW IF I CAN ADDRESS TO FISCAL ISSUES I. I THINK IF ARE A CHILD HAS GONE A THIRD GRADER HAS SIX MONTHS. WITH. THE TIME OF SIX MONTHS TO. FILE A CLAIM WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THAT THAT NEVER WAS THE INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE AT ALL. AND. CASES ON SEXUAL ABUSE YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT THERE'S GOING TO BE. IS NUMBERED NOT GOING TO BE A TIME. WHEN WE HAVE SUPPORT CASE ON THE ON THE SUBJECT. SO. I WOULD URGE I WOULD URGE THAT TOM. WHAT IT COMES TIME IF THE ARM? THE FISCAL ISSUES ARE CONSIDERED. THAT. THEY ACTUALLY LOOK AT. FISCAL ISSUES FOR THE CHILD. AND IMPACT ON THE CHILD IN THE FUTURE OF THAT CHILD'S LIFE. AS OF FISCAL IMPACT IF YOU WAT TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. I THINK WE'LL FIND THAT. SPILLERS. A REFLECTION THE LEGISLATORS PRIORITY AND WOULD SAVE. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT FROM US STRICTLY ECONOMIC WAY OF SAVE THE STATE A LOT OF MONEY. I DON'T TOOK IT LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. I LOOK AT THIS IS JUSTICE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT WE PASS THESE LAWS SERGEANT AYE VOTE HONEST. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM AYE CHAU. CHAU AYE CHIU. HOLDEN. KALRA. KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN AYE REYES AYE REYES AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE. THAT BILL IS OUT. AND THEM WE KNOW BOTH ITEM NUMBER THREE SENATOR HILL S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR OF AND AND MEMBERS. S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD PROTECT VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND ENSURE THAT LANDLORDS CANNOT DENY. HOMELESS VETERANS HOUSING BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY RECEIVE A RENTAL ASSISTANCE BALLOT CUT HER. US VETERANS IN THOSE CURRENTLY SERVING IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE PROTECTED FROM EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BY THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. HOWEVER THE LAW DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE VETERANS OR MILITARY PERSONNEL AMONG THOSE WHO ARE PROTECTED FROM HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. ALMOST EVERY OTHER PROTECTED CLASS IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT IS PROTECTED IN BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING DISCRIMINATION STATUTES. S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD ADDRESS THIS GAP. BY ADDING VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL AS A PROTECTED CLASS IN STATUTES RELATING TO HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL FACE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CHALLENGES. CALIFORNIA HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF VETERANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS VETERANS ARE FIFTY PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS THAN OTHER AMERICANS. A LARGE NUMBER OF DISPLACED AND AT RISK VETERANS LIVE WITH LINGERING EFFECTS OF PTSD. AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE WHICH ARE COMPOUNDED BY A LACK OF FAMILY AND SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS. VETERANS ALSO FACE SIGNIFICANT STIGMA IN THEIR HOUSING SEARCHES. HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LANDLORD REPRESENTATIVES IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THIS BILL IS APPROPRIATELY TAILORED. WITH THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AND CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION HAVE AGREED TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION I WANT TO THANK THEM. FOR THAT AND FOR THEIR WORK WITH US IN THIS LEGISLATION. OUR VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL ALREADY FACE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CHALLENGES THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY. ABOUT BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WHEN TRYING TO FIND A HOME FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WILL ENSURE OUR HEROES ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST N HOUSING AND ARE NOT DENIED. HOUSING BECAUSE OF HOW THEY PAY THEIR RENT. AND I WOULD DECISION SUPPORT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THINK. THANK YOU FOR THIS IN SUPPORT PLACE CABINET CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS SET THREE OR THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. I'M A COMBAT VETERAN WITH TO COMBAT DEPLOYMENTS OF THE US ARMY INFANTRY. I'M REPRESENTING AMERICAN LEGION DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA AMERICAN GI FORM OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY VETERANS. SERVICE OFFICERS MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. OF AMERICA CALIFORNIA COUNCIL CHAPTERS CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS VETERANS COUNCIL VIETNAM VETERANS ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL. AND. OF CALIFORNIA HAS OVER NINE THOUSAND HOMELESS VETERANS WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL HOMELESS VETERAN POPULATION. AND I CAN TELL YOU WITH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE NOT THAT I'VE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND HOUSING. BUT WHEN INDIVIDUAL SOME INDIVIDUALS FIND OUT THAT. SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO AS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. THEY LOOK AT YOU DIFFERENTLY. BECAUSE OF YOUR POSSIBILITY MENTAL CAPACITY. SO I THOUGHT MY EXPERIENCE JUST IN THE LAST TEN YEARS FROM BEING HOME FROM COMBAT. AND I KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENS AND. SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T PROVE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND IT DOES HAPPEN OUT THERE AND I'M AFRAID THAT IT IS HAPPENING TO OUR VETERANS THAT ARE COMING HOME AND. THEY'RE NOT GETTING A FAIR CHANCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STAND FILLS OUT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. CREAM THREE CM BATH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. HERE TODAY WITH IMPOSING WAS AMENDED POSITION ON S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. OF THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE BILL WHICH SEEKS TO AMEND THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT TO INCLUDE BETTER MILITARY STATUS SEE OURS PERFECTLY FINE WITH. THAT HOWEVER THE SECOND HUNDRED COMPONENT OF THE BILL REDEFINED SOURCE OF INCOME TO INCLUDE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS FOR VETERANS AND MILITARY EFFECTIVELY REQUIRING ALL RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT. UNDER HUD'S VETERAN AFFAIRS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAM. IT'S IMPORTANT AT THAT SECTION EIGHT WAS DESIGNED TO BE VOLUNTARY BECAUSE UNLIKE CASH VOUCHERS SECTION EIGHT ENTAILS EXTENSIVE COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. UNIT INSPECTIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS TO TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO FILL WHILE THE UNITS IT'S VACANT. MOST NOTABLY SECTION IT REQUIRES THE LANDLORD TO ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT KNOWN AS A HAP WHERE HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS CONTRACT. S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE ALL LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT UNDER THE AFOREMENTIONED PROGRAM BY FORCING THEM TO ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH THEY MAY BE UNABLE TO FILL. EARLIER THIS YEAR. SEE OUR WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS TO AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN TEN WHICH ENSURES THAT LANDLORDS CAN ACCEPT CASH VOUCHERS FROM THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT ESTABLISHING A LANDLORD TENANT RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT THIRD PARTY. HOWEVER THE BILL EXCLUDED SECTION A PRECISELY BECAUSE SECTION EIGHT REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO CONTRACTUALLY ENTRY INTO AN AGREEMENT AND SUBJECTS THEM TO OTHER. STANDARDS THAT MAY BE BURDENSOME TO MANY LANDLORDS. SEE OUR BELIEVES THAT SECTION EIGHT SHOULD REMAIN VOLUNTARY AND AS A RESULT OPPOSES US BE FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN UNTIL THE MANDATORY SECTION A PROVISIONS ARE REMOVED FROM THE BILL. AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT. THANK YOU. GIVING UP MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON RUN KINGSTON REPRESENT A FOR REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS. CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CITIES ORANGE COUNTY EAST BAY AND NORTH VALLEY PROPERTY OWNERS ASSOCIATION WE TO. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO. SENATOR HILL FOR COMING IN LATER THEN I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED WE WERE JUST. IF WE HAD A LOT OF OTHER PRIORITIES I'LL HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH SENATORS STAFF. THEN HE IT I HAD TO COME BRIEF CONVERSATION. TODAY OUR FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON A SIMILAR. OR PARALLEL FACES SAYS THE REALTORS I AND I WANT TO BRING THIS HOME IN TERMS OF ITS REAL PRACTICAL IMPACT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BRINGS US TO ONLY FOCUS IN ON ONE NARROW PROVISION OF THE BILL. ALL THE REST OF THE. PROPOSED CHANGES IN LAW ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US AND WE ASK. THAT YOU WERE EMBRACE OUR REQUEST. THE. WE ARE NOT FOCUSING ON. THE VETERANS AT ALL OUR CONCERN IS THE ACTUAL PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. TALKING WITH SEVERAL OF OUR. PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE ACCEPTED VASH NOTABLY AND LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WHO HAVE OF MANY PROPERTIES HERE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHEN THEY HAVE ACCEPTED OF VASH? HOMELESS VETERAN. MOST OFTEN WITH EIGHT SO IT'S ILLUSTRATED BY. A COUPLE EXAMPLES AND THEN WE'LL GET TO. THIS SPECIFICS. BOB ONE EXAMPLE LANDLORD CHANGES IT ALL ALL THE CARPETING IN THE HOUSE. INSPECTION AND THE. THE VETERAN MOVES IN. RECEIVING THE VASH PAYMENT WHICH AS YOU MAY KNOW IS GOOD FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS MAY BE EXTENDED AND THEN MAY NOT. IN SIX MONTHS. AN INSPECTION IS DONE AFTER THE. HOMELESS VETERAN NOW IS. I IN THIS RESIDENT. RESIDENTS. AND THE INSPECTION NOTES THAT COULD SO OIL HERE. THE CARPETING IS VERY SOILED. THE INSPECTION. IMMEDIATELY RESULTS AND. BARRING THE LANDLORD. TO. CLEAN THE CARPET AND ABSORB THE COST. I AND THEY STOP PAYMENT IN TILL A MONTHLY RENT UNTIL THAT IS DONE. ANOTHER. SIMILAR. THERE IS SUCH A PROBLEM WITH. THE FILTH IN THE UNIT INSPECTION. SHOWS THAT AFTER SEVEN MONTHS OF OCCUPANCY. GUESS WHAT HAPPENS SAME REPETITIVE PATTERN ANOTHER. LANDLORDS WHERE THIS IS EXPERIENCE AND THEY FIND THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS. THE INSPECTION SAYS THERE'S TREMENDOUS FILL WE ARE WITHHOLDING RENT CLICK MAKE SURE IT'S CLEANED UP. THE BUILDING INSPECTION DEPARTMENT GETS INVOLVED REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. GETS INVOLVED AND A FEW MONTHS LATER IT'S FINALLY RESOLVE LAMBERT HOUSE TO CLEAN THE UNIT MOVE THE VETERAN OUT OF THE. UNIT AT THEIR COST. AND THEN. THE UNIT IS REKLAME AND IT IS REPEATED JUST MONTHS LATER THE SPHINX AND I NEED TO WRAP UP WITH HER THANK YOU MISTER. SO HERE IS OUR REQUEST. PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE FIXED. CASE MANAGERS FOR EACH OF THE VETERANS ARE NOT PRESIDENT ONLY JUST MONTHS AFTERWARDS UNTIL THEY SHOW UP FORCING THE LANDLORD. TO. FIX THE. OR REPAIR THE PROPERTY AT THEIR GREAT EXPENSE. THAT'S ONE OUT OF TWO ISSUES WERE ASKING THE PROGRAM TO BE FIXED WHICH MEANS THAT IT. YEAH I DON'T LAST BUT NOT LEAST. WE HAVE NOTED IN OUR. LETTER OF OPPOSITION THAT. WE FEEL THAT IT IS NOT. APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE FORCED INTO WHAT IS OTHERWISE KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AS A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WHICH IS FASHION. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IT'S ENOUGH TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. IF YOU HIS ADDRESS. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BUT THE BILL FORWARD. WE DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP OUR VETERANS. SPECIAL HOMELESS VETERANS. IN READING THE OPPOSITION AND HEARING THE TESTIMONY A TODAY I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND I DO HOPE THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO HAVE THE INSPECTIONS DONE WHEN OUR VETERANS MOVIN. SO THAT THAT'S THE POINT OF EVALUATION THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP SO WE CONTINUE THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT'S THE IDEA. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE LANDLORDS WHO WILL CONTINUE TO WELCOME OUR VETERANS I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT OUR LANDLORDS TO THEM FOR GET TO A POINT WHERE THEY SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. BUT THE THE BILL IS AN IMPORTANT ONE I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. IN THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SING NONE SANITY MIKLOS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS INTO AN AND I AGREE I THINK THE PROGRAM IN THE WAY IT'S ADMINISTERED COULD USE SOME. HELP AND SOME IMPROVEMENT AROUND CALIFORNIA'S AND. IN THOSE HOUSING AUTHORITIES THAT MAKE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS AND CHOICES AND I THINK. IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK AT AND I WILL WILL DO THAT. BUT I DO WANT TO PUT THIS IN IN CONTEXT THIS YEAR. CALIFORNIA WAS AWARDED TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. HIDE BASH ABOUT SHOULD DOCTORS TWENTY TWO HUNDRED OUT OF SIX MILLION HOUSING UNITS. AND THE THE THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET FOR LANDLORDS AND THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THE. DROPPING THEIR OPPOSITION THESE MEN AND WOMEN ARE WILLING TO MAKE THAT ULTIMATE SACRIFICE IN AND FOR OUR FREEDOM OF CHOICE AT LEAST WE CAN DO. IS TO DO THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE. A. HOUSING VOUCHER FOR IN A FAIR SHOT AT HOUSING THE OTHER ISSUE. THAT I THINK IS. IS INTERESTING IS. THE CHALLENGES FACED WITH HUD VOUCHERS AND. AND THEY HIDE VASH VOUCHERS. THAT WE HEAR TODAY. A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS% NOT A HOUSING SHORTAGE. THOSE SAME LANDLORDS WERE STRUGGLING AND BAKING TOGETHER HIDE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. BUT AS THE MARKET CHANGED THAT CHANGED AS WELL SO THAT TIME WILL PROBABLY COME AGAIN. AND THEY WILL BE UP. HUNGRY FOR THOSE VOUCHERS WHEN THEN WHEN THEY NEED IT IS AND WHEN THERE'S A SHORTAGE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MEMBERS AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY.
