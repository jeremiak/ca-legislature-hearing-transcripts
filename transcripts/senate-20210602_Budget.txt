OUR SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ALL BEEN WORKING EXTREMELY HARD HOURS IN HEARINGS AND READING MATERIALS TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS AND I REALLY WANT TO APPRECIATE AND THANK YOU FOR THAT. GOOD WORK I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF. FOR BOTH PARTIES. FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOUR EXCELLENT WORK IS ALSO HIGHLY APPRECIATED AND WE KNOW YOU'VE SACRIFICED MANY NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS INCLUDING MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND TO GET US READY FOR TODAY. AND TO ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE WHO MANY WHO HAVE ADVOCATED FOR YEARS FOR ITEMS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET. AND WHO HAVE SHARED THEIR INSIGHTS. THAT EITHER HEARING SIR CAUCUS MEETINGS OR TO THE OUR BUDGET SET CHAIRS. AND TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHOSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BUDGET PROCESS ARE INVALUABLE I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS AND I KNOW THAT- THOSE THANKS WHICH ARE EXPRESSED BY. ALL OF US IN THE COMMITTEE. I'M. OUR AGENDA IN ACTION TODAY REPRESENT A JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET AGREEMENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY. AND WE ARE THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ALSO MEETING TODAY AND WE WILL BE ACTING IN FACT VERY COMPARABLY. THAT WILL ALLOW US THEN TO HAVE A TWO PARTY AGREEMENT THAT WE CAN THEN. IN A CAGE THEN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO GET TO OUR POINT OF A FULL THREE PARTY AGREEMENT AND ADOPTION BY OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF JUNE. JUNE FIFTEENTH. I'M. NOW LET ME KNOW IF YOU THINKS OUR LEGISLATIVE BUDGET IS BASED ON THE REVENUE ESTIMATES BY OUR FELLOW. AND WE HAVE HAD CONFIDENCE IN THOSE ESTIMATES THEN WE'VE LOOKED AT THEM OVER TIME THEY HAVE BEEN VERY ACCURATE AND IF ANYTHING THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER. WHAT THE REVENUES WE'VE ACTUALLY RECEIVED. D. LEGISLATIVE BUDGET CONTINUES. THE DEMOCRATS RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING AND IT HAS. TWENTY FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION IN OUR RESERVE FUNDS. GROWING TO THIRTY FIVE BILLION BY TWO TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WE ALSO FULLY PAY OFF SCHOOL DEFERRALS IN PRE PAY SOME PENSION AND OTHER DEBTS. THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET THERE WILL BE ACTING ON TODAY ALSO RETAINS AND BUILDS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO US WITH THE MARY VICE. WE EMBRACE OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR'S GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS TWO POINT OH THOSE- THE ACTION THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDS TO OUR FAMILIES OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND INCOME BELOW. THE SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFIT GRANTS AND MUCH MUCH MORE. BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ADDED ON. OUR FOR EXAMPLE IN THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION AREA WHERE WE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE SLOTS TO SUPPORT MORE CHILDREN. AS WELL AS PROVIDING READING CREASES FOR OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AND WE EMBRACE THE PROPOSAL FOR UNIVERSAL TRANSITION- KINDERGARTEN TKT FOR THE FOUR YEAR OLDS WE MODIFY IT SOUNDSA LITTLE DIFFERENT VISION. AND PROVIDING SOME OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES. NO THIS BUDGET INCLUDES A RECORD NINETY SIX POINT ONE BILLION FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT- WHICH- OBVIOUSLY IS. A UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT IN CALIFORNIA OF PER PUPIL SPENDING BUT WE ALSO INCLUDE SUPPORT TO ASSIST AND RETAIN OUR TEACHERS. AND TO MOVE TOWARDS A GOAL OF PROVIDING. UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS TO ALL OF OUR K. TWELVE STUDENTS. THIS BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES UNPRECEDENTED FINANCIAL AID EXPANSION TO HELP CALIFORNIANS ACHIEVE DEBT FREE COLLEGE. IN AN EXPANSE THE GOVERNOR'S ACTION ON HOMELESSNESS FUNDING BY PROVIDING MULTI YEAR INVESTMENT TO HELP HOUSE OR ON HOUSE RESIDENTS AND PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. UNDER BUDGET RECOGNIZES THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE AGE FIFTY AND ABOVE THAT MEET MEDICAL INCOME ELIGIBILITY DESERVE THAT COVERAGE. I'M WE ALSO CLEARLY AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN CLIMATE RESILIENCY IN WATER IN DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION IN. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN ALL FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND WE SUPPORT OUR LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS WITH INCREASED INVESTMENTS TO ALLEVIATE HUNGER ELIMINATE MANY FEES PROVIDE EXPANDED ACCESS TO LEGAL AID AND OTHER JUSTICE SERVICES. EACH THE PAYMENT TOWARD DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED RESIDENTS AND SO MUCH MORE. NOW I WANT TO NOTE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE LOOKED AT OUR DETAILED AGENDA. THIS AGENDA REFLECTS THOSE ITEMS THAT ARE SUB COMMITTEES DID NOT CLOSE OUT IN OTHER WORDS THAT WERE LEFT OPEN. FOR THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD TO BE MODIFIED- IT ALSO FINALIZES THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET ARCHITECTURE. AND COMBINED FOR THOSE OF YOU MAY BE LOOKING OKAY WELL WE'RE YOU KNOW WE DON'T SEE EVERY SINGLE ACTION HERE THAT'S BECAUSE TODAY'S ACTIONS COMBINED WITH THE BUDGETSUBS PREVIOUS ACTIONS OR THEN WILL THAT BE THE BASIS. FOR THE BUDGET BILLS IN TRAILER BILLS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. IN FACT THE REFLECTS THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET. AND THEN ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE IN THOSE ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BETWEEN NOW AND OUR FINAL BUDGET VOTE ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. THEN WEALL I'M SURE AND I PERSONALLY LOOK FORWARD TO A FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR REFLECTING OUR SHARED PRIORITIES. NOW TO START WE HAVE TO DISCUSSION ITEMS RELATED TO THE BUDGET AGREEMENT'S FRAMEWORK. AND AFTER HEARING THOSE ITEMS WERE HERE BOTH OF THEM. WILL THEN PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH FIFTEEN MINUTES OF PUBLIC COMMENT. BEYOND FOLLOWING THAT WE WILL VOTE ON THOSE ITEMS. WE WILL THEN HAVE THE VOTE ONLY ISSUES TAKEN UP BY SUBCOMMITTEE BUT BEFORE WE VOTE SO IN OTHER WORDS WILL DO THE FIRST TWO ITEMS PUBLIC COMMENT VOTE THEN START SEPT ONE. AND WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT BOX FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES ON SEPT ONE. AND THEN VOTE. AND THAT THE SAME PROCESS FOR THE REST OF THE ITEMS AND GIVEN THAT WE WOULD REALLY ASK THOSE FOLKS IN THE PUBLIC WHO WANT TO SHARE THEIR ACTS YOU KNOW JOIN WITH US AND EXPRESSING SOMETHING PUBLICLY WE REALLY HOPE THAT YOU CAN BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE AND BASICALLY JUST SAY YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION AND WHAT DO YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE AN ACTION AND IF IT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO ADD A LITTLE DETAIL WE'D REALLY APPRECIATE IF YOU CAN STATE UNDER A MINUTE. BECAUSE WE ONLY ARE GIVING FIFTEEN MINUTES TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS AND ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO CALLS IN AND TAKES UP A LOT OF TIME IS CUTTING OUT THE TIME FOR OTHERS SO I'LL BE STRICT ABOUTTHAT TIMING- THE MAJORITY OF ITEMS ON THE BOAT ONLY WERE DISCUSSED AND VETTED IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ITEMS ON TODAY'S AGENDA THE NOTE THAT DOWN AS WE ARE IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. ALL ACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RECONCILIATION CORRECTIONS AND POTENTIALLY TECHNICAL CHANGES SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE FIRST TWO DISCUSSION ITEMS WHICH ARE THE BUDGET FRAMEWORK AND PROP NINETY EIGHT SO I MEAN TO BEGIN WITH ASKING THE LA- TO PRESENT BUT BEFORE THE LA- DOES PRESENT I REALLY WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS TO THE LA- IN THE ALLEY- STAFF THIS YEAR THE LA O'S OFFICE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL TO BOTH HOUSES IN ADVISING US. IN CRAFTING OUR BUDGET AND ITS ARCHITECTURE EXCELLENT WORK REALLY APPRECIATE IT- ALL RIGHT SIR ELLIOTT WHICH. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MY- OKAY. MISTER WITH YOU SAY DAY YEAH AND- IT ENDED YOU CAN. X. AND GET PEDICLE ANALYST YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE WITH YOU I WAS TO PROVIDE. AN OVERVIEW. AS THE- CHAIR SAID OF THE FOR TO GET ON YOUR AGENDA. BUT ISSUE- IS LEGISLATIVE PACKAGES SECTION REGARDING REVENUES AND PROPOSITION TO THE BUDGET FRAMEWORK. AND THEN THE SECOND ISSUE IS- DESCRIPTION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. SO I'LL BEGIN WITH THE REVENUES- AS THE CHAIR SAID THAT LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE USES THE REVENUE ESTIMATES FROM OUR OFFICE- OVER IT'S A BUDGET WINDOW FROM THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OUR OFFICES MAY REVENUE ESTIMATES WERE HIGHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BY ABOUT FOUR BILLION. IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE FACTORS IN ABOUT FOUR BILLION YEAH FINAL TAX PAYMENTS THAT WERE RECEIVED IN APRIL AND MAY AFTER WE CLOSE THE BOOKS ON OUR FORECAST. THIS ADDITIONAL EIGHT MILLION IN REVENUE WOULD BE OFFSET IN THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE BY THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS TWO POINT NO PAYMENTS WHICH TOTAL ABOUT EIGHT BILLION- THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE COUNTS THE PAYMENT OF THOSE- THE DISBURSEMENT OF THOSE PAYMENTS AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE. SO ON NET AFTER YOU ACCOUNT FOR THESE VARIOUS ITEMS OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES ACROSS THE BUDGET WINDOW ARE ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR TO- THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE DIFFERENCE OF LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION. I CAN OFFER A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS ON OUR ON OUR REVENUE FORECASTS- IN MAY WHEN WE COMPLETED OUR ESTIMATES WE DETERMINED THAT THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STATE REVENUES THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOTTO BE SUSTAINED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. OUR ASSESSMENT OF THIS IS CONSISTENT WE THANK WEST- THE CONSENSUS VIEW OF ECONOMISTS WHICH GENERALLY ARE EXPECTING ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE NEXT YEAR- THE ECONOMY IS HELPED ALONG RIGHT NOW BYE SUBSTANTIAL FEDERAL FISCAL STIMULUS AND THE CONTINUATION OF LOW INTEREST RATES THAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY. AND- BY STATEMENTS FROM OUR CENTRAL RESERVES- CHAIR. AS WE LOOK FURTHER AHEAD IN OUR MULTI YEAR ESTIMATE OF REVENUES WE ASSUME THAT GENERAL FUND REVENUES WILL GROW AT AN AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF ABOUT 4% NO THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN THE TWENTY YEAR HISTORICAL AVERAGE- IN THE GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN OUR ESTIMATES AT THE END OF THE- TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE PERIOD. WOULD REACH TWO HUNDRED AND SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY BILLION HIGHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OFRIPPED US FINANCES ESTIMATES AT THE END OF THE MULTI YEAR PERIOD. A KEY REASON FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE ESTIMATES FROM OUR OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS IN THE AREA THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX. AND IN PARTICULAR- HOW WE ESTIMATE THE TRENDS ENCOMPASSING COMPENSATION FOR THE HIGH. A HIGH INCOME EARNERS PARTICULAR. OUR FORECAST ASSUMES THAT HIGH INCOME EARNERS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE RELATIVELY STRONG WAGE AND SALARY GROWTH WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT YOU KNOW RECENT HISTORY. AND YOU KNOW IF WE WERE TO COMPARE IT TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S. IT IT TEARS THE ADMINISTRATION'S OUR FORECAST. IS EXPECTING MORE A GROWING SHARE OF WAGES AND SALARIES WILL BE GOING TO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME WAGE EARNERS SO THAT'S PROBABLY. THE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR TWO- WE'LL TAKE YOUR OUTLOOKS. SO THEN MOVING ON TO PROP IS TO AND RESERVES- AS THE CHAIR SAID THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE PROVIDES FOR TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION IN TOTAL RESERVES. THIS INCLUDES FIFTEEN POINT NINE BILLION IN THE PROPOSITION TO BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. A TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. THOUGH I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS AMOUNT COULD CHANGE UPON SCORING BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THEN- AT THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE CLICKSO IT'S SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION BACK INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE BRINGING THE TOTAL TO ONE POINT TWO BILLION- IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE FIGURE CITED HERE ALSO INCLUDES FIVE POINT THREE BILLION IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESEARCH. SO IN. WE SOME ALL THESE UP. IT'S A LITTLE LESS THAN A DAY MORE THAN WHAT IS IN MAIL WITH THE- WHICH HAD TWENTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN RESEARCH FROM THE SAME SOURCE- THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN WOULD MAINTAINS A THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IN PROPOSITION TWO DEBT PAYMENTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT WERE IN THE MAY REVISION BUT GIVEN THE USE OF OUR HIGHER REVENUE ESTIMATES. IT WOULD PROVIDE FOR MORE DEBT PAYMENTS ACROSS THE MULTI YEAR. SPECIFICALLY RELATIVE TO THE MAY REVISION. THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. THROUGH THE. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THE HIGHER REVENUES WOULD ALSO RESULT IN HIGHER DEPOSITS INTO THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT DURING THESE YEARS BRINGING TOTAL RESERVES TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX BILLION BY THE END OF THIS MULTI YEAR PERIOD. OKAY WITH SO THAT KIND OF SPEAKS TO. THE REVENUES AND THE PROPOSITION TWO ASPECTS OF THE- THAT'S- AHEAD IN THE FIRST ISSUE IN YOUR AGENDA. SO I'LL JUST BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THE SECOND ISSUE NOW WHICH IS- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SO AS THE CHAIR SAID. UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. WOULD TOTAL. NINETY SIX POINT ONE BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. COMPARING THAT TO THE MAY REVISION THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE PROVIDES FOR TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN ADDITIONAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THAT'S A THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE AND THEN IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE IT'S A TWO POINT THREE BILLION- THE DAILY INCREASE IN. IT IN THE BUDGET YEAR- NOW IN ADDITION- I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AMOUNT WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE LARGER THESE ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WOULD ALSO TRANSLATE TO AN INCREASE DEPOSIT INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESEARCH SO PRACTICALLY A QUARTER OF THAT ADDITIONAL PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION WOULD GO INTO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVES. THE REST OF IT ABOUT TWO BILLION WOULD BE SPENT ON PROGRAMS. AND WHEN I COME TO THE PRO- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. HOW THE RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED BETWEEN ONE TIME AND ONGOING- THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE SIMILAR TO THE MAY REVISION- PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF. THE RESOURCES TO ONE TIME PURPOSES WHICH WE HAVE OVER TIME WE HAVE SAID IS YOU KNOW ADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE IT CREATES A QUESTION FOR- PROGRAMS IN THE EVENT OF THE FUTURE PROP NINETY EIGHT ARE GUARANTEED DROP. SO I CAN JUST BRIEFLY TELL YOU THAT OF THE ONE TIME SPENDING THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE DOES MAKE SOME DIFFERENCES FROM THE MAY REVISION. SPECIFICALLY IT REJECTS IT REDUCES ABOUT FIVE BILLION YEN MAY REVISION ONE TIME PROPOSALS AND REPLACES THEM NOTABLY WITH A TWO POINT SIX BILLION TO PAY OFF ALL OF THE REMAINING K. THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE- PAYMENT DEFERRALS. AND THEN- IT ALSO WOULD FUND SOME LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THAT ARE ONE TIME SUCH AS HIGH SCHOOL BLOCK GRANTS INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND THEN LASTLY WHEN IT COMES TO ONGOING SPENDING. THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT NINE BILLION YEAH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING. IN K. TWELVE THE LARGEST AUGMENTATIONS ARE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION BASE FUNDING STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS IN RATE INCREASES IN CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AND THEN- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE LARGEST INCREASES ARE FOR FULL AND PART TIME FACULTY CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS A HIGHER ON BASE THE PORTION RENTS INCREASED AND- STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS. SO THAT THAT. IT IS VICE OF THE FIRST ISSUES AND HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS. I'M GONNA SEE IF THE D. O. F. R. DEPARTMENT FINANCE WANTS TO MAKE ANYMORE ARE ANY COMMENTS- BEFORE WE CHECK WITH FOLKS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS TO EITHER YOU OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS THAT YOU WANT TO ADD. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ERICA LEAVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND I WILL BE BRIEF AND KEEP MY COMMENTS TO A HIGH LEVEL- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY- AS YOU NOTED THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SHARED PRIORITIES IN THE LEGISLATIVE AND- SPECIFICALLY THE SENATE PLAN- WHEN COMPARED TO THE MAY REVISION. AND THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY TO COME TO A FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT A THREE WAY AGREEMENT- THAT IS STRUCTURALLY BALANCED THAT MAINTAINS THE BUDGET RESILIENCE AND OF COURSE IMPORTANTLY INVESTS IN AND MEETS THE NEEDS OF- ALL CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC- LIKE THE MAYOR VISION THE SENATE PLAN. PROJECTS REVENUE GROWTH- AS MR PADDOCK JUST EXPLAINED- ALBEIT A HIGHER LEVEL GOING TO BE ABOUT TWENTY BILLION MORE THAN THE MAY REVISION IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE- AND WE JUST WANTED TO KNOW IN IN OUR pREVENUE PROJECTIONS. DOES INTRODUCE A GREATER DEGREE OF FISCAL RISK THE BUDGET IN THE OUT YEARS ESPECIALLY IF THOSE PROJECTED REVENUES FOR THEIR ONGOING EXPENDITURES RATHER THAN ONE TIME SPENDING. AND THIS IS REALLY DUE TO TWO REASONS BUT- I'M SURE WILL BE FAMILIAR TO THIS COMMITTEE THE FIRST BEING THAT CALIFORNIA'S REVENUE PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO QUITE A BIT OF VOLATILITY- AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE HIGHEST INCOME EARNERS IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO PAY- A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE STATE'S INCOME TAX- FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TOP 1% OF EARNERS ACCOUNTED FOR. ABOUT. 46% OF ALL- SO INCOME TAX. AND I WAS JUST OVER A AND SOME THOUSAND. TAX RETURNS SO CORRECT IN THE STOCK MARKET NOT EVEN EVERY- COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS NEGATIVE IN. TO COME. REVENUES AND SECOND I'M OF THE NATURAL. SOMETHING WE BEEN LEARNING QUITE A ABOUT THIS PAST YEAR IS. THERE'S ALSO JUST A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND BUILDING THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET COMPARED TO OTHER BUDGETS- AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE INFLUX OF STUFF SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING- THAT'S COMING INTO THE STATES- AND THE INCOMING ASSOCIATED ROLES IN REGARDS TO THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS- RECENTLY. WE'VE BEEN WE'VE WE'VE WITNESSED AND EXPERIENCED THIS IN THE PAST WEEK OR SO- IN REGARDS TO FEDERAL GUIDELINES BEING RECENTLY RELEASED. FOR THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AFTER OUR PHONE- AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE- TO CHILD CARE PROPOSALS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION THAT- USED OUR FINDINGS- WE LEARNED WILL. WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO USE OUR FUNDS- AND REQUIRE A GENERAL FUND BACK FILLED IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND BEYOND TO MAINTAIN THESE PROPOSALS SHOULD BE SHOULD BE MAINTAINED HIS PROPOSALS. AND THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF- THE UNCERTAINTY BEHIND THE PROPOSALS IN THIS BUDGET- FOR WHICH GUIDELINES WILL BE ISSUED OR HAVE AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW- AND FUTURE YEAH. BY LINES THEY COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS EVEN AFTER A FINAL BUDGET HAS BEEN PASSED LATER THIS YEAR- SO THE MATE MARRIAGES REVENUE FORECAST YES IS MORE CAUTIOUS THAN THE ONLY OTHERS TO COVER THESE RISKS. AND THEN BUDGET REVISIONS BUDGET STRUCTURE LIKEWISE AS PROMISED- ON ONE TIME SPENDING OVER I'M GOING SPENDING WE HAVE A NINETY TEN SPLIT. 90% OF THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR ONE TIME BUT- ONE TIME EXPENDITURES VERSUS TEN PERCENT- I'M VERY TARGETED- I'M GOING EXPENDITURES. AND THIS IS REALLY BECAUSE IT IS MUCH EASIER TO PULL BACK OR REDUCE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES AND ON THE FLIP SIDE IT IS- NOT TOO EASY OR QUICK TO UNWIND OR CUT ON GOING EITHER ENTITLEMENT STATUTORY OR CONSTITUTIONAL. OBLIGATIONS SHOULD THE STATE NEED TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY. TO A NEGATIVE FISCAL SCENARIO. SO THAT SAID AGAIN- THERE ARE MANY SURE PARTIES IN BOTH THE BUDGETS- AND AS THE GOVERNOR STATED YESTERDAY- THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPTIMISTIC. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DETAILS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ONCE IN A GENERATION- BUDGET THAT WILL SUPPORT MILLIONS. OF CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISLI. I HAVE COUPLE OF. FOR AND FOR. LA- SO FIRST. I'M MISLEAD YOU X. THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION- FIVE THIS CONCERT ABOUT COST PRESSURE IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET- BUT MY WHAT WILL YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT IS THE GROWTH FACTOR WHICH THE WEAPONS USING FOR YOUR OUT YOUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS. I WAS SURE I THINK WE ARE BETWEEN ONE AND 2% COLBY WAIT ON THE LINE WHO COULD CONFIRM THAT BUT I BELIEVE IT IS ABOUT HALF OF WHAT- THE LA O'S BIRTH ACTORS. COME ON I THINK THAT'S WHAT I HAD SEEN IN THE DOCUMENT TO SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE KOBE- YEAH IF ONE IN TWO PERCENT. 4% GROWTH AND- MR PECK YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE WHAT THE LA ROSE- WROTE THE ESTIMATE IS AND WHETHER THAT WHETHER THAT IS HIGHER THAN HISTORICAL AVERAGE OR LOWER. WELL OURS IS- MORE IN THE RANGE OF AROUND 4% IN THE OUT YEARS. AND OUR IMMEDIATE IF YOU LOOK AT IT OVER A TWENTY YEAR TIME FRAME OURS IS ACTUALLY STILL A BIT LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH RATE ALTHOUGH- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY INHERENTLY I MEAN THERE'S A RANGE THERE IS NO WAY TO PREDICT FOR CERTAIN WHAT THE REVENUES WILL BE- AND WE TRY TO DO OUR BEST ESTIMATE THAT COMES IN AT ABOUT US FIFTIETH PERCENTILE SO REVENUES COULD CERTAINLY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN WHAT WE ESTIMATED. AND YOU KNOW SO I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING- REALLY THAT MY- COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID IT'S JUST- YOU KNOW THIS BUT THE FACTS ARE. OURS GROWS AT ABOUT LITTLE BIT SLOWER OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEAR PERIOD THAN WHAT. WE ACTUALLY SAW. THIRTY YEAH I MEAN DO. NOT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT IT WHEN I. WHETHER SOMEONE AND CLEARLY THESE ARE FORECAST TO THEIR PROJECTIONS BUT WHETHER WE FULLY AGREE WITH THE 4% PROJECTION. WOULDN'T YOU DESCRIBE A ONE BETWEEN 122% SIR NOT EVEN 2% GROWTH PROJECTION IS BEING PRETTY CONSERVATIVE CONSIDERING THE TWENTY YEAR AVERAGE. YES AND AS I STATED IT OUR OUR GROWTH RATE IS MORE CAUTIOUS- AND I WANT TO JUST KNOWING THAT I SAW THE GROWTH RATE IN THE IN THE AGENDA AND IT'S NOT BETWEEN ONE POINT SIX. AND TWO POINT 7% TO BETWEEN ONE AND A HALF 23% GROWTH RATE- AND YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S THAT IMPORTANT. POINT I THINK I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS NOT SO MUCH WHO'S RIGHT IN REGARDS TO THE REVENUE BUT JUST THE INCREASED RISK- AND I'M BANKING ON HIGHER REVENUE SHOULD NOT COME AND SO I THINK THAT IS. PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT THE HIGHLIGHT HERE. AND YET WE KNOW THAT. CERTAIN THINGS IF WE DON'T BUY NOT FINDING THEM BY ADOPTING A MORE. A MORE CAUTIOUS AS THEY SAY THEN THERE ARE. WELL LET'S PUT IT A DIFFERENT WAY WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE LIVES NOW WHEREAS THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH MIGHT NOT. AND WHO'S TO SAY WHAT FURTHER COSTS THAT MAY THEN CAUSE US. IF BY NOT TAKING THE INVESTMENTS NOW SO THAT'S MORE MY COMMENTARY BUT LET ME ASK YOU A DIFFERENT QUESTION MISLI- I UNDERSTAND THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS SENT A LETTER TO COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. REQUESTING COST ESTIMATES FOR THE STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTION HAVE YOU ALREADY RECEIVED THE RESPONSES FROM THE COUNTY'S. YES I'M SURE WE DID ISSUE A LETTER- LAST WEEK AND DID THE DEADLINE FOR COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS TO RETURN INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO- POTENTIAL COSTS FOR THE RECALL ELECTION WAS DUE YESTERDAY SO AT THIS POINT WE'VE RECEIVED FIFTY ONE OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT- STATES THAT SORRY COUNTIES RESPONSES- SO. THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE RESPONDED AND LIKELY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS WE'LL BE TAKING A LOOK AT THAT ANALYZING IT IN REGARDS TO- TOTAL STATEWIDE COST OKAY. I'M IN A PART OF MOTIVATION FOR MY- ASK IS THAT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDING FOR THAT STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTION AND GIVEN THAT WE ARE SCHEDULED TO ADOPT A BUDGET ON JUNE FIFTEENTH IF WE HAD THOSE COST ESTIMATES. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO APPROPRIATE WHEN WE TAKE OUR ACTION ON THE BUDGET- I AGREE I THINK THAT DOES MAKE SENSE AND WE SHOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION- AGAIN IN A MATTER OF- SEVERAL DAYS. OKAY GREAT WELL I'M SURE WE WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING IT AS SOON AS IT'S- RECEIVED AND COMPILED. THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL ALL RIGHT LET ME LOOK NOW THROUGH MY- COLLEAGUES AND SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS EITHER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR THE OHIO. ALL RIGHT SEEING NINE. THEN WE WILL NOW. MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS REGARDING THESE TWO DISCUSSION ITEMS WHICH WERE. THE FRAMEWORK. OF THE- LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET AND THE PROP NINETY EIGHT AMOUNT.

RIGHT- FIVE S. SENATOR LARRY GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WAS. GOING TO MAKE SUMMARY COMMENTS BUT SHE DID A GREAT JOB AND I THINK WHAT THIS BUDGET DOES IS PEOPLE SEE THE MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND- CLEARLY THAT THERE WAS MONEY THAT WENT INTO THE EDUCATION RAINY DAY FUND TO MAKE IT OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT THERE'S A PAY DOWN OF OVER THREE BILLION. ON ON THE OUR PENSION OBLIGATIONS THAT THERE IS PAY OFF OF THE DEFERRALS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT BOTH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THE R. K. THROUGH TWELVE LEVEL THAT WE RESTORED FUNDING AT EVERY BRANCH LEVEL AND THEN HAVE A COST OF LIVING INCREASE ABOVE IT THAT'S IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE PERCENT. AND SO THIS IS REALLY IN ADDITION TO REFORMING STUDENT AID AND DOING THE FAMILY OPTIONS IN PRE K. THIS IS REALLY A BUDGET THAT MOVES AWAY AHEAD OF ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL IN EDUCATION FOR KIDS OR FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN A GENERATION AND SO. I THINK WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THIS BUDGET IT SAVES MONEY FOR THE FUTURE IT DOES SOME OF THE BEST IMPROVEMENTS IT MOVES TO ADAPT THREE COLLEGE IT HELPS KIDS BEFORE THEY GET TO KINDERGARTEN. THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT AND I WILL BE PLEASED TO VOTE FOR IT AND I'LL BE READY TO MOVE IT WHENEVER WE ARE COMPLETE- QUESTIONS IN THE COMMONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAVE LEARNED I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CARING THAT SUBCOMMITTEE IN OVERSEEING IT ALL AND I. YOU KNOW WE HAD I ASKED SOME QUESTIONS TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA- ABOUT THESE GROWTH PROJECTIONS BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOME CONCERN. THAT PERHAPS OURS MIGHT BE TOO AMBITIOUS BUT I THINK THE EXACT THING THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED THE FACT THAT IN OUR BUDGET STRUCTURE WE ARE PAYING DOWN ALL OF THE DEFERRALS. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PENSION DEBT IN FACT OR INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE SO THAT IN IN THE CASE WHICH ONE COULD HAPPEN. THAT THE GROWTH IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECT WE'VE AT LEAST CREATED CUSHION. AND LESS DEBT FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND WE KNOW THAT DEBT OBVIOUSLY INCREASES OUR COSTS OVER TIME SO. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND I THINK IT'S VERY PRUDENT- THE ACTIONS THAT ARE BEING RECOMMENDED BY YOURSELF. NOW WE'RE GOING TO JUST HOLD OFF ONE MINUTE BEFORE I TAKE EMOTION BECAUSE WE MAY NEED TO SPLIT THE MOTIONS A COUPLE OF TIMES SO JUST HOLD ON. GOOD ALL RIGHT SO WE ARE GOING TO HOLD OFF TAKING A VOTE ON SOMEONE WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OFF ON THE ROADS. BECAUSE WE ARE STILL WORKING OUT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BE.

BUT TESTIFIED TO IT IN OUR PANELS- WE HAVE THE LEGAL AID SERVICES FOR RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS I SAW THAT THERE WAS- CALLERS ABOUT HOMEOWNERS. TO AVOID EVICTION AND FORECLOSURE. WE HAVE A NEW REHABILITATION REDEMPTION RE ENTRY AND READING UNIFICATION PACKAGE BECAUSE WE WANT EVERYBODY TO WHO COMES OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO STAY OUT.

APPS THIS IS OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH ALL EMPLOYERS TO PAY WELL WHO HAVE APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING PROGRAMS AND- RECRUIT FROM- HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES SO THERE'S MUCH MUCH MORE BUT- THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WORK OUT WE SHOULD ALL THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THANK YOU MANAGER. AND BEFORE I CALL ON SENATOR NEWMAN I WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIR SENATOR DRAW SO- SEPT FIVE IS OBVIOUSLY DEAR TO MY HEART CAT BEING- CHAIRED IT FOR THE FOUR YEARS PREVIOUS OR PRIOR. AND I KNOW. HOW MUCH- SO MANY CALIFORNIANS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE ACTIONS THAT YOU DESCRIBED  MEAN JUST FOR EXAMPLE WELL WE HAVE. A BOTH AN EVICTION ANTI FORECLOSURE MORATORIUM. THE AND WHEN WE SEE NEWS REPORTS THERE SEEMS TO BE REAL ALARMING- PREDICTIONS OF A HUGE WAVE OF BOTH THE FICTIONS AND FORECLOSURES. BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE DATA THAT THOSE TENANTS AND THOSE OWNERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE. CAN OFTEN. AVOID AND WHEN I SAY VOID I DON'T MEAN THAT THEY IN ANY WAY WOULD BE- BREAKING THE LAW BUT RATHER THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND EITHER WHAT THE RIGHTS OR THE TERMS OF CONTRACTS ARE VERY THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE CAN ASSIST THEM SO THAT THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO RETAIN EITHER THEIR HOME OR THE PLACE THAT THEY LIVE AND OBVIOUSLY WE DO NOT WELL WE HAVE FUNDS NOW WHEN WE'RE INVESTING TO HELP PREVENT AVOID HOMELESSNESS WE DO NOT KNOW A LOT OF BIG WAVE OF NEW HOMELESSNESS SO I THINK. MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SO WISE AND OBVIOUSLY THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO EITHER WERE LAID OFF OR LEFT THE WORK FORCE DURING THE PANDEMIC THEIR JOBS MAY NOT RETURN SO WE NEED TO HELP. PROVIDE THE TECH PART OF PROCREATING DEVELOPMENT SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK TO THE WORK FORCE IN JOBS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO BE RETAINED SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE ON THIS AND THE STAFF DID. AND. NOW I WILL CALL ON SENATOR NEWMAN. AND IN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SO- BEEF I S. MY QUESTION LET ME. FIRST BECAUSE- YOU- AND THE STAFF OF THE LARGER BUDGET COMMITTEE- FOR ALL THE WORK BUT BUT I JUST POORLY THANK. AND COMMEND THE CHAIR OF MY SUB SUB FIVE SENATOR ROGER WHO'S DOING WONDERFUL JOB- AND ALSO THE STAFF OF SOME FIVE. SO WE'RE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE ALL THREE OF I GUESS FOR PEOPLE SO ALL OF THEM- I HAVE A QUESTION KIND OF A TWEENER I THINK BETWEEN SO FOUR TO FIVE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. THE U. I. DEATH IN THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT TRENDS TAX CREDIT- ELEMENT AND SO IT'S MY QUESTION IS PROBABLY FOR SOME COMMISSION THE LA- AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE- IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE FROM THAT RUINING THEIR- DINNER IN SOME WAY. CERTAINLY AND- I WILL TURN TO BOTH L. A. O. AND U. F. BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET OUR APPROACH. FOR THAT- UNEMPLOYMENT DEBT AND THE CREDIT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS PROVIDED- PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISE. BUT LET'S SEE WHO WANTS TO START. I HAD A NAME IN THIS IS ERICA LAY WITH HER. FINANCE ENGINE. I WOULD JUST NOT EXACTLY SURE THE QUESTION BUT- PROPOSAL THAT- THE MAIN REVISION INCLUDE WAS PAGAN. OF THE U. I TRUST FUND. OF ONE. ONE BILLION DOLLARS- USE OF OUR FINDS A LOT- ALONG WITH LANGUAGE THAT ANY. USED OUR FUNDS AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WOULD ALSO APPLY IF YOU APPLIED TO PAY DOWN THAT TRUST FUND- BALANCE. THAT WAS THE MAY REVISION- PROPOSAL. IN YET A MANAGER I MINUS ANY SAID OUR- SOLUTION ARE BARB IS DIFFERENT DID DID DID APPLY SAID BY WAY OF TWO AND- TAX CREDIT- AND SO MY GUESS IT'S APPLIES TO AN MILLION IN TAX FOR THE- BUT IT'S- HARD. MORE AT THE SMALL BUSINESS YES AS A ARE THE- IT'S OUR SYSTEM. THAT THEY ARE THE ONE WHO WOULD BE MOST HARD BY SUCH DEBT. AND IT'LL THEM TO MORE QUICKLY. RECEIVE SOME RELIEF. AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE STRUCTURE OF WHAT WAS IN THE MAY REVISE MAY NOT. THE BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT. WOULD MAY NOT- EXPERIENCE OR RECEIVE THAT BENEFIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY NINE TWENTY THIRTY. SO NOW I APPRECIATE THAT SO MUCH OF THE QUESTION REALLY. THEY CAN IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN I GUESS I COULD START WITH INITIALLY- THE AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE COMPANY'S CURRENT YOU ARE THERE TO SOME OF THE ORDER OF TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS PROJECT TO GO MUCH HIGHER- AND THAT. THE TAX CREDITS. ALTHOUGH THEY MAY PROVIDE RELIEF WON'T. OFFSET ANY OF THE INTEREST THAT ACCRUES AGAINST. THE DEBTORS IS THAT CORRECT. ALL RIGHT YEAH I CAN REALLY SPEAK TO THAT TYPE CREDIT BUT IN. TO THE TEAM OF THE YOU ARE BY- THE- IT IT APPLIES TO ALL OF. IN STATE THAT PAID. THE TRUST SO. IF THERE IS A- IN THE U. TRUST FUND FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS- OVER TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS THERE THERE WOULD BE AN IMPACT ON THE EMPLOYER TAX RATE. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WELL THIS. AT THE BETTER LEVEL IN REGARDS TO A TAX CREDIT- ALL EMPLOYERS WHO DO RECEIVE A 6% TAX CREDIT- AS PART OF THE FEDERAL IT'S CALLED THE FOOD OFF. AND HOWEVER IF THE STATE HAS A NEGATIVE BALANCE- THAT CREDIT IS REDUCED- ANNUALLY- FROM A FIVE POINT 4% AND I THINK IT'S POINT ENCOURAGE YOUR QUESTION JUST THAT'S SORT OF HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD WORK IS WE WOULD PAY DOWN THE TRUST FUND THERE WOULD BE A BALANCE STILL REMAINING. BUT IN REGARDS TO INTEREST THE STATE IS ON THE HOOK FOR PAYING THE INTEREST IN REGARDS TO- THEY FEDERAL TRUST FUND ITSELF SHOULD ENSURE ISSUE HAD WE HAD WE MADE A DOWN PAYMENT AGAINST THE DEAD IT WOULD HAVE SAVED US SOME AMOUNT. OF INTEREST OVER TIME RIGHT SO GOOD COULD DID DID YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH THAT MIGHT HAVE. SAVED THE STATE PROSPECTIVELY OVER. IT WAIT WAIT WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK SEE IF E. D. D. ROUTE UP IN ORDER TO THE BUT YOU THE SOONER WE CAN DOWN THAT DEBT THE LESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY OVER THAT'S TRUE AND THEN THEN I GUESS THE REMAIN MICROCHIP FOR THE LA- OR FOR OUR SIDE- AND INSISTS I MEAN IT DID THIS TECH CREDIT IS DESIGNED TAKE PLACE OF TEN YEARS- WHAT'S YOUR SUREN STAY THAT HE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE FOR ALL TWENTY. AND WHAT WOULD HAVE IF IT DOES NOT. THIS PADDOCK YOU WANNA RISK TO THAT. GIVE HEADACHES. LET'S ANALYST- YOU KNOW I MIGHT ASK MY CO BRIAN YOU'LL FROM OUR AND LABOR UNIT TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY INSIGHT AND NOT ON ON WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE- CREDIT IF IT'S NOT MAINTAINED OVER THE TEN YEAR PERIOD. YES THANK YOU GAME OF GRANULAR WITH THE OHIO- THERE YOU KNOW THE ASSURANCE FOR THE CREDIT- CONTINUING TO EXIST WOULD BE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD- YOU KNOW AS THEY DO WITH ALL OUR TAX CHANGES HAS A TRAILER BILL THAT PLACES IT INTO STATUTE- THERE ISN'T ANYTHING YOU KNOW- THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO BIND THE HANDS OF FUTURE LEGISLATURES SO IT WILL REMAIN IN LAW- THERE'S NOTHING. THE CAN STOP A FUTURE LEGISLATURE FROM APPEALING THAT BUT- YOU KNOW THE FUNDING FOR THOSE TAX CREDITS. ARE BUILT INTO THE LEGISLATURE'S PACKAGE IN THE OUT YEARS- IT IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT IT'S- THE INTENT OF THE PACKAGES IS SIGNALING TO PROVIDE THIS ACTUALLY IT'S OVER TEN YEARS- SO. I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION NO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S FAIR- AND IS IT IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS IS THAT AT SOME POINT- THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE US SOME LEVEL OF RELIEF FROM OUR CURRENT YOU ARE DEAD. THE CRYSTAL BALL GO HEAD YEAH I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T THINK. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT I THINK WE WOULD ALL- GRATEFULLY ACCEPT THAT TYPE OF RELIEF FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- BUT- WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE- RESEARCHERS ARE THEN IN THE END WE YOU KNOW WE AS A STATE OR- AND ALL THE BUSINESSES ATTENDED. THE YOU WHY- ARE GOING TOO FAST DID DID TO HAVE TO PAY DOWN THE DEBT THE INTEREST. OVER TIME- AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT. THIS PROGRAM TO LIVE REALLY TARGET SMALL BUSINESSES. WHAT WAS THE THINKING WITH RESPECT TO OTHER BUSINESSES PARTICULAR MEDIUM TO LARGE SIZED BUSINESSES- THAT THEY TEND TO SHOULDER A LOT OF THE BIRD PAYING. THESE U. I. TAXES. I WOULD THAT. TO THAT THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OR MAYBE THE CHAIR OUR OUR OFFICE WAS NOT- NECESSARILY INVOLVED WITH THE CRAFTING OF THIS ELEMENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. FAIR ENOUGH. FIVE JUST A COUPLE THOUGHT SENATOR NEWMAN FIRST OFF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS WAIVED INTEREST RATES FOR THE U. Y. DE THREE SEPTEMBER. WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT MOVING FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY ON YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION ONCE THE LEGISLATURE PUTS THE TAX CREDIT IN PLACE IT WOULD TAKE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. TO ELIMINATE THAT TAX CUT FROM SMALL BUSINESSES SO. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO VOTE BY TWO THIRDS TO ELIMINATE IT- THE LOGIC FOR THIS. IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME IS THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE- STOCK MARKET IN OTHER INDICATORS MANY OF OUR LARGER BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DOING. VERY WELL AND SOME PROFITING. YOU KNOW DOING THEM FAR BETTER IN FACT UNDER THIS PANDEMIC WERE AS OR SMALL BUSINESSES. HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HURT NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS THERE SOME LARGE BUSINESSES WHO WERE HURT ALSO BUT IN GENERAL THE SMALL BUSINESSES HAD A FAR WORSE ECONOMIC IMPACT THEN THE LARGER. BUSINESSES SO THE MOTIVATION WAS TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE MOST WHO'VE BEEN MOST IMPACTED NIGHT I DO APPRECIATE THAT SO IT'S SO I WOULD ASK IT BY WAY OF FINISHING MY COLLEGE- IF DO YOU EVER COULD PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT WOULD. PAYING OFF DID YOU KNOW SOME. AMOUNT I THINK IT BETTER ONE POINT ONE BILLION IT MAKE A COMMENT WHAT WOULD THAT HAVE SAVED- INTEREST RATE JUST FOR THE STATE OF THE COURSE OF THE SAME TEN YEAR PERIOD IF THEY COULD GET BACK% TO US I'D. BE GRATEFUL- BUT THANK YOU. SENATOR ALL RIGHT ANY COMMENTS- BY- COLLEAGUES OR COURSE YES SENATOR PARRY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE CHAIR OF THE LET'S CAR I DID WANT TO JUST CALL OUT AND THANK- THIS FOR. LOOTING THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION- IN GENERAL FUND TO COMBAT. THE INCIDENTS- THE API- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY HE HAS BEEN RISING- ACTUALLY FORTY NINE- AMONGST MANY GROUPS- TALKING AS MANY GROUPS- AND- MORE SPECIFICALLY AGAINST THE API COMMUNITY AT THE TECH THERE'S BEEN A SPIKE- RELATED. TO BOTH COVE IT BUT ALSO TO THE RHETORIC THAT'S. AROUND THAT AND- IN AS WE TRY TO PROVIDE TO CALIFORNIA THE CAN- THE- NEEDS THAT RELIEF SO THIS STUFF THE JOB THAT VICTIM- ALSO. INTERESTING ENOUGH THE DATA THAT WE GOT CAME FROM NOT FOR PROFIT SO WE NEED TO HAVE- A- DATA COLLECTION AS WELL BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS SOME HISTORIC INEQUITIES IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO PROGRAMS FOR THE API COMMUNITIES SO HERE IN THIS BUDGET WE'RE- PROPOSING- MANY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PROGRAM TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES TO HELP INDIVIDUALS WHO FOUGHT SUFFERED. BECAUSE OF COVE IT AND ITS IMPACTS- BUT FOR THE P. I. COMMUNITY WE NEED INTERPRETATION AND- INTERPRET CORE AND BE SURE WEPEOPLE HAVE. IT IN LANGUAGE HEALTH- WE NEED TO BE SURE WE UPDATE EQUITY BECAUSE TOO OFTEN OUR COMMUNITIES AND VISIBLE AND THE DIVERSITY OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND THOSE ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IN THERE AND THEN WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT. WE HAVE ARE I THINK ENCLAVES WHO ACTUALLY SUFFERED EVEN PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH LOCKDOWNS. WERE ALREADY SUFFERING IS A DISCRIMINATION SO AGAIN I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE THAT THAT'S IN THIS PACKAGE I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL SEE FIT TO SUPPORT- THE STATE SENATE. AND ASSEMBLY AND SUPPORTING THIS PACKAGE SO WE CAN PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE API COMMITTEE BUT ALSO MORE BROADLY I THINK ELEMENTS OF THIS ARE MORE BROADLY FOR ALL THE- DIFFERENT RACIAL AND ETHNIC CAUCUSES AS WELL- TO HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES AS WELL BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY HE HAS BEEN HAPPENING ACROSS.

WE URGE YOU TO EXPAND THAT RELIEF UNTIL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AS THE INDUSTRY AND CAPITAL TAKE UNTIL THEN TO RECOVER WITH REGARD. TO RIDERSHIP AND REVENUES. THANK YOU. I'M SURE THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN Q. EXCELLENT OKAY SO THAT WAS OUR AND CONCLUDING OUR PUBLIC COMMENT WE'VE HEARD IT NOW FOR THEFIRST TWO ITEMS AND ALSO OUR SUBS ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE. AND- WE I WANT TO. APPRECIATE ALL OF THE PUBLIC WHO PARTICIPATED IN PUBLIC TESTIMONY TODAY AND IF THERE WERE ANY OF YOU WHO WANTED TO THAT WE- RAN OUT OF TIME. PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR COMMENTS IN WRITING TO THE BUDGET IN FISCAL REVIEW COMMITTEE WHICH YOU CAN DO EASILY ON OUR WEBSITE. AND THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TO US AND WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T LIKE TO HAVE TO TURN TO CUT OFF PUBLIC COMMENT SO IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO WASN'T ABLE TO- WE REALLY DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUBMIT TO US- ALL RIGHT NOW- WE- ARE WAITING FOR. A VOTING LIST- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DIVIDE SOME OF THE BOATS UP A BIT WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE JUST ABOUT A THREE TO FIVE MINUTE PAUSE. FOR THAT LIST. SO WE'RE GONNA PAUSE FOR JUST FINE. I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T SAY THREE TO FIVE I SHOULD JUST SAY FIVE. WE'LL PAUSE FOR FIVE MINUTES OKAY. FIVE MINUTES FIVE MINUTES. MMHM. OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE WILL RECONVENE SO IF I GET EVERYONE'S ATTENTION BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO START VOTING NOW ANDY I'M GONNA ENTERTAIN MOTIONS I'M GOING TO READ THE ITEMS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON- SO LET'S START WITH SUB ONE. SENATOR GROVE YOU HAVE A COMMENT BEFORE WE START I DO I HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON A COUPLE OF THE ITEMS IF THAT'S OKAY MADAM CHAIR- WE TOOK THAT BEFORE I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO VOTE. I KNOW THAT WE WERE TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE THE VOTE SO WE ARE YOU GO HEAD THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE INDIVIDUAL VOTES WE CAN JUST CONSOLIDATED. THAT'S WHY WE MISSED IT JUST IF ANYBODY COULD ANSWER ON- BUDGETS OF FIVE. ITEM SEVEN AND TWENTY FOUR THEY'RE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED IS THERE A REASON SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE. SEVEN AND. TWENTY FOUR. DO WE NOT HAVE LA OR FINANCE ON THE LINE MA'AM. ONE MOMENT LET'S SEE IF OUR BUDGET SAID CHAIR WANTS TO MAKE A COMMENT OKAY. LIKE THEY SEEM LIKE GOOD ITEMS THAT IT'S JUST A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE INCREASES FOR ONE MOMENT. SENATOR DRAWS OR DID YOU WANT TO COME IN HERE ON ANY OF THOSE. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE PARTICULARS OF IT BUT. THIS COMES UNDER- YES- I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT IT'S IT IS AN EMERGENCY IT'S SEVEN FIVE MA'AM IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY ITS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUNDS FOR HOMELESS YOUTH EMERGENCY SERVICES COUNTY HOUSING WHICH SOUNDS AMAZING BUT IT IS ALSO- I BELIEVE EIGHT TIMES THE AMOUNT THAT IT WAS LAST YEAR SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ARE WE SERVING MORE REVIEWS WHICH IS GOOD WELL IT'S SAD THAT THEY'RE HELPING YOU KNOW HOMELESS BUT- I JUST WONDER WHY INCREASE SO DRESS ON AND I CAN ADDRESS THAT OKAY ON THE HOMELESS OBVIOUSLY. THE- WE HAVE INCREASED THE INVESTMENT FOR HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL. BUT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR HOMES PROGRAMS DON'T NECESSARILY SERVE HOMELESS YOUTH IN BECAUSE HOMELESS YOUTH HAVE. VERY PARTICULAR NEEDS. ON AN OFTEN SHOULD BE A SEGREGATED SAFE FROM ADULTS TURNING ON THE H. SO IT WAS FELT THAT WE NEEDED TO SEPARATE SOME FUNDS. IN OUR INVESTMENT OVERALL HOMELESSNESS IS A GREAT DEAL LARGER OBVIOUSLY THAN LAST YEAR'S AND SO THIS IS I WOULD SAY PROBABLY NOT PROPORTIONATELY LARGER BUT LARGER FOR THAT REASON. THAT'S PERFECT MA'AM I JUST LIKE IT WAS A GOOD PROPOSAL BUT I JUST DIDN'T. UNDERSTAND WHY THE INCREASE CAN I JUST ACCEPT THAT AS- THE SAME THING WITH THE STATE- ITEM NUMBER- TWENTY FOUR AT ITS TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIMES GENERAL FUND FOR THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS. FOR THE CAL THE A. P. PROGRAM FOR YES YES SO THAT'S SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR AND THE REST OF THAT IS THE SAME. CORRECT I'M SURE THE SET PAD THAT YOUR MATE THE STRUCTURE MAY WANT TO ADDRESS THAT BUT I CAN SAY. THAT- WE- OUR SUBCOMMITTEE WANTED TO INCREASE THE INVESTMENT IN THE CALIPHATE THEIR MIND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PROJECTIONS THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE. FUNDING TO DO SO WE WERE UNABLE TO- HOWEVER I THINK ALL OF US KNOW. TRAGICALLY GUN VIOLENCE IS UP. AND SO TOO IT IS OBVIOUSLY THE TIME THAT WE WOULD WANT TO GREATLY INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT CAN HELP REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND I'M SURE THAT WENT INTO THE SUB COMMITTEES DELIBERATIONS AND I READ MANY STAKEHOLDER LETTERS. ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM- BUT I CAN CERTAINLY ALLOW THE SCEPTRE COMMON IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO SENATOR DRUGS OR- THIS IS ON ACCOUNT THAT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD. OKAY THANK YOU MA'AM AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION AGAIN WE WERE ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF VOTES TOGETHER SO- IT'S A SEVEN FOUR AND IT'S ON THE U. I TRUST FUND- SO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ARE. THE RECOMMENDATION ON ITEM NUMBER THIRTY ONE FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE WHICH IS US AT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR DIRECT PAYMENT TO THE WIFE AND- AND THE PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE TAX BREAKS. IF WE ACCEPTED THE GOVERNOR'S ONE POINT ONE BILLION DIRECT REDUCTION THAT SAVES THE STATE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN INSURANCE INTEREST PAYMENTS WILL THESE TAX CREDITS APPLIED TO THE REDUCTION OF THE U. I TRUST FUND AS WELL OR NOT. WE HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION WERE YOU WERE OUT ABOUT THAT HONEY LET ME SEE IF- BELIAU CAN YOU- YEAH. MR PATRICK DO YOU WANNA GO AHEAD GO AHEAD GET YOUR REGULAR WITH ELIO- AS I MENTIONED WE WORK WE WORK CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH THE CRAFTING THAT PROPOSAL BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT IT WOULD NOT APPLY TO. JANE DOWN THE BALANCE OF THE SEASON THE DEBT. DOES IT GO TOWARDS INTEREST HI I WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT APOLOGIES I- IT AS I MENTIONED WE HAD THAT ROBUST DISCUSSION BUT I WAS DISTRACTED NOW BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING OUT OR BREAK DOWN AND MAKING SURE THAT I HAD. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT PROPERLY FORMULATED IN MY HEAD BUT I WILLRETURN NOW TO BUY BUT ABILITY TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION WHICH I CAN'T NUMBER ONE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS WAIVED INTEREST THERE'S NO INTEREST UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHETHER THEY ACT FURTHER WE DON'T KNOW YET NUMBER TWO THE WAY THAT THE- PAY DOWN WAS STRUCTURED UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHILE IT WAS PAYING DOWN LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE DECK. IT WOULD NOT HAVE BENEFITED THE- BUSINESSES UNTIL. GOOD POINT THE FUTURE PERHAPS TWENTY TWENTY NINE EVEN TWENTY THIRD ADDITIONALLY IT WAS. FOR ALL AND- OUR STRUCTURE NOW WITH A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CREDIT ON GOING. WHAT IS TARGETED TOWARDS OUR SMALLER BUSINESSES WHO OBVIOUSLY ARE THE ONES WHO SUFFERED THE MOST DURING THIS PANDEMIC THEY HAD THE MOST ECONOMIC IMPACT. AND DUST THE- THE ABILITY TO PAY THAT DEBT IS WHAT IS- HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEM MORE THAN MOST OF OUR LARGE BUSINESSES NOW NOT ALL OF OUR LARGE BUSINESSES THRIVE. DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT MANY DID THUS YOU SEE THE- EVERY AND ECONOMIC INDICATOR SHOWS THAT THE ROPE THE STOCK MARKET OUR OWN REVENUES VARIOUS OTHER THINGS SO THE FEELING WAS IN OUR RESTRUCTURING. THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS POINT IN TIME WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ASSISTING THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE MOST ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED. AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION THEN WE CAN VOTE MA'AM I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TAX CREDIT SINCE THAT WAS REDONE REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT COMING UP WITH THE SENATE'S. PROPOSAL AND IT SAYS IT GOES FROM TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY THREE CAN WE DURING THIS BUDGET BIND FUTURE LEGISLATURES. AND ABILITY TO CRAFT THEIR OWN BUDGET WILL THIS CONTINUE TO GO WHERE CAN IT BE CIRCUMVENTED NEXT CYCLE FOR OR THE CYCLE AFTER. SO ANY STATUTE WE PASS CAN BE UNDONE BY A FUTURE LEGISLATURE HOWEVER IN THIS CASE IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE BECAUSE IT IS A TAX CREDIT. BUT WE CAN AFFECT CAN NEER FULLY BIND ANY FUTURE LEGISLATURE THOUGH BY TWO THIRDS VOTES IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDO. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT NO WORDS. AND- ANY OTHER COMMENTS BEFORE WE START THE VOTING PROCESS. AND APOLOGIES FOR A. I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS ABLE TO. ALL RIGHT SO NOW THIS IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE COMPLICATED. BUT IT'LL BE WE'LL BOTH BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND COMPLICATED SO ON. OUR SUB ONE EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE I WOULD LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION AND I'M GOING TO READ THE ITEMS ON THE FOLLOWING ITEMS.
