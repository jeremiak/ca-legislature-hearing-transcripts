DIEM EMPLOYEES ARE SIMILAR TO

SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS IN OUR

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:46.485
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ON THE ISSUE OF

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:50.690

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.097
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. SHOWS THAT

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.733
WAGE AND BENEFIT PARITY COSTS

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.300
FOR THESE SERVICE WORKERS IS

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:05.738
COMPLETELY COMPLETELY OFFSET BY

LEAVES THIRTY EIGHT MILLION

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:12.645
DOLLARS FOR ANY OVERHEAD COSTS

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:17.416
UC MIGHT INCUR. MR GYMNASTS

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:18.584
ANALYSIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.753
STATE AUDITOR WHO REPORTED THAT

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.855
OUTSOURCED WORKERS MAY COST

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:24.690
MORE THAN YOU SEE EMPLOYEE

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.092
WORKERS WHEN YOU ACCOUNT FOR

00:10:26.158 --> 00:10:29.929
VENDOR OVERHEAD. ON THE ISSUE

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:30.496
OF THOSE EXISTING OUTSOURCED

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:34.367
CONTRACT. THE ACA APPLIES AT

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:36.936
THE EXPLORATION OR RENEWAL OF

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.138
EXISTING CONTRACTS AND SO THIS

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:40.973
MEANS THERE IS A PHASE IN

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.043
PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS. AND

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.546
THE ACA DOES NOT DICTATE WHO OR

00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:48.080
HOW MANY WORKERS SHOULD BE

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:52.485
HIRED. ON THE ISSUE OF WORKING

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:56.222
IT OUT WITH YOU SEE. THE ISSUE

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.723
OF OUTSOURCED SERVICE WORKERS

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.324
HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FOR OVER A

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:01.927
DECADE. BUT THE ONLY THING THAT

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:03.396
HAS CHANGED IS THE NUMBER OF

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:07.867
OUTSOURCED WORKERS. AND TODAY

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.702
THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:12.138
AMERICANS EMPLOYED BY YOU SEE

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:14.840
AS SERVICE WORKERS HAS DECLINED

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:17.810
BY THIRTY PERCENT. WHILE AT THE

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:20.913
SAME TIME 30% OF OUTSOURCED

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.716
WORKERS IN LA AND SAN FRANCISCO

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.718
ARE NOW AFRICAN AMERICANS. IN

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:30.222
CONCLUSION. UNDER ARTICLE NINE

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:32.358
OF THE CONSTITUTION NEITHER THE

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:33.859
GOVERNOR NOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.594
HAVE THE POWER TO ENSURE

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:36.762

ISSUE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN

00:43:58.535 --> 00:44:00.637
THIS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:01.672
I SERVED ON THE BOARD OF

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:04.108
REGENTS MANY YEARS AGO AND HAVE

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:05.542
LIVED THROUGH THE HISTORY OF

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:07.277
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BETWEEN

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:10.881
LABOR ON THE ONE HAND. AND THE

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.049
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IN THE

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:13.884
OTHER MR PELOTA TERMS OF HIS

00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:16.220
LEADERSHIP. IN THE EARLIER DAYS

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:18.288
IN THE LIKE AND SAW. A THAT

00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:20.157
THIS WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS NOT

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:21.625

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:24.428
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE THAT. AT

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.763
THE UNIVERSITY AND HOW WHICH

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.531
NEGOTIATORS OF TREATED FOLKS

DIDN'T HAVE THAT HISTORY. AND

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:35.439
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE

00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:37.641
LOOK TODAY TO THE ISSUES THAT

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:38.742
WE FACE IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:41.145
HISTORY. ARMED AND UNDERSTAND

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:42.546
THAT THERE'S A REASONABLE BASIS

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:43.180
OF FRUSTRATION THAT HAS

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:44.214
OCCURRED IN TERMS OF THOSE

WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE

NEGOTIATED IF YOU. HAD BUT WE

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:13.737
SEEN FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:16.874
WHICH INFORMS THIS FRUSTRATION

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.310

THIRTEENTH I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:51.542
RIGHT. PERIOD AND I THINK IT'S

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:53.310
BEEN FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG.

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:54.845
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE USED

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.380
EVERY BEST EFFORT TO TRY TO GET

00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:57.514
TO THE TABLE THE CD COULD REACH

00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:59.283
A RESOLUTION ON THIS STUFF. I

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.684
KNOW THE ARGUMENT HAS BEEN MADE

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:02.419
THAT WELL OKAY. GREAT WE HAVE

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.054

THAT'LL BE LIMITED CONTRACT

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:06.056
DOESN'T PROTECT EVERYBODY GOING

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:08.325
FORWARD. OUR ARGUMENT OKAY. BUT

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.294
I THINK CREATIVE LAWYERS CAN

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.495
WRITE ALL KINDS OF PROVISIONS

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:13.564
IN YOUR- NEGOTIATING DOCUMENTS

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.232
AND I THINK THAT. IT'S QUITE

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:16.533
IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY SITS

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.802
TO THE TABLE I WILL. VOTE FOR

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:20.070
IT IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PROCESS

00:47:20.137 --> 00:47:21.705
MOVING HOPEFULLY GETS OUT OF

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:23.173
APPROPRIATIONS WE CAN. TAKE IT

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.108
TO THE FLOOR BUT MY AT MY VERY

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:27.110
HOPE IS THAT I WILL NOT COMMIT

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:28.312
TO VOTE FOR. FLOOR AND I HOPE

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:30.581
THAT. ALL OF THIS THING IS

00:47:30.647 --> 00:47:32.783
RESOLVED BEFORE THAT TIME. SO

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:34.151
THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE CARE

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:36.019
ABOUT OUR TAKEN CARE OF. AND

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:37.754
THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO GO ON THE

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:38.388
BALLOT IN THE FORM OF A

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:40.324
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. THAT

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.359
IMPACTS SO MANY OTHER ELEMENTS

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:43.293
OF OTHER CRITICAL ISSUES THAT

TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.468
LIKE SO. I DO THINK IT BEARS

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.704

DECADES IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.348
FRANKLY THEY HAVE TO BE AT THIS

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:48.151

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.152

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:20.717
AMENDMENT TO THAT THAT LARA

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.986

GYMNAST LETTER TO I WANT TO

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:51.415
AGITATE ON THAT THOSE THE TWO

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:51.982
ISSUES I WAS HOPING WE COULD

00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:56.253
SORT OF. LOOK AT. SO. THE

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:58.655
PREFERENCE HERE I'M GONNA HAVE

00:50:58.722 --> 00:50:59.289
MISLED BIGELOW AT STANFORD LAW

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:02.292
EDUCATION. WITH AN UNDERGRAD I

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:03.860
ACTUALLY UCLA LOSS OKAY I DON'T

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:06.997
WANT IT. YES I DO IS JUST THE

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:12.302
DIRECT. I BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:14.504
AT CAL THAT MAKE ME FEEL BAD

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:15.071
FOR YOU SO I'M SORRY THAT'S

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:23.246
RIGHT. AND GO BEARS. THERE'S SO

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:24.314
SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:25.148
CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE RAISED AND-

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:29.586
YOU KNOW. ONE FUNDAMENTAL

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:32.389
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACA AND

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:34.357
THE LAR BILL IS THAT THE ACA

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:36.693
ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THE PUBLIC

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.294
INSTITUTION DIRECTLY AND THE

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.997
CONCERN THERE. THE LARA BILLS.

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:43.633
BY LAW COULD ONLY REGULATE THE

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.469
ENTITIES THAT DID BUSINESS WITH

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:49.439
THE PUBLIC INSTITUTION. BUT I

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.308
THINK MORE FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:54.110
IMPORTANT THAT NO ONE CONFLATES

00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:55.946
PUBLIC POLICY WITH COLLECTIVE

00:51:56.012 --> 00:51:58.215
BARGAINING ON ISSUES AS

00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.983
FUNDAMENTAL AS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.753
OPPORTUNITY. IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.956
DON'T RELEGATE ISSUES OF A

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:07.290
QUALITY TO THE VAGARIES OF

00:52:07.357 --> 00:52:08.458
NEGOTIATIONS AMONG ANY TWO

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:12.662
PARTIES. WHETHER IT'S VOTING

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:14.531
RIGHTS GENDER PAY EQUITY OR

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:19.836
MARRIAGE EQUALITY. ACA FOURTEEN

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:21.071
IS PUBLIC POLICY FOR A PUBLIC

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:24.875
INSTITUTION. BUT VOTERS SHOULD

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:25.942
HAVE A CHANCE TO ENSHRINE IN

00:52:26.009 --> 00:52:31.047
THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THERE'S

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:34.684
AN ANSWER QUESTIONS. I THE

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:36.186
MECHANICS I GET YOUR YOU'RE

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:37.087
GOING AFTER THE PUBLIC

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.822
INSTITUTIONS SOME MATTERS OF

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:40.657
PRINCIPLE ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE I

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:41.157
GET THAT SORT OF POLICY

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:46.730
PRINCIPLE. BUT. COULD COULD WE

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.465
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT I GUESS

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:50.133
THE WAY THE IF I UNDERSTAND THE

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.701
WAY THIS IS WRITTEN WE STILL

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.970
HAVE ROOM FOR SOME STATURE

00:52:54.037 --> 00:52:55.338
THEIR STATUTORY ROOM PRESERVED

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:56.673
HERE AND IN FACT IT WOULD SORT

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.241
OF COMPELLED THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:01.878
ADDRESS. THIS IS THE CONTRACT

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:04.180
WORK STATUTORILY GOING FORWARD

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:05.749
THAT SORT OF THE INVERSE I

00:53:05.815 --> 00:53:08.418
GUESS OF WHAT. THE LARA MODEL

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:09.719
WOULD HAVE BEEN WHICH IS

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:10.353
STATUTES FIRST AND THEN PUSH IT

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:14.658
BACK BUT- IS YOUR SENSE THAT.

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:15.625
SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.227
THE OPPOSITION AND CONCERNS

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:18.962
FROM THE UC COULD WE DEAL WITH

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.965
THAT BY STATUTE FOR SAY THOSE

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:24.467
EXTRA ASSISTANCE IN THE

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:26.403
RADIOLOGY UNIT OR THE SPECIAL

00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:28.271
EVENTS CIRCUMSTANCE THAT AT

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:30.373
PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL POINTED

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:30.907
OUT. IN SORT OF SUBSEQUENT

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:34.044
STATUTE I'M READING IN. C. ONE

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.980
A UNDER THIS SORT OF NOT ARE

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.281
NOT JUST A BUT SORT OF ALL THE

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:40.750
PERMISSIVE. EMERGENT BONAFIDE

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:42.085
EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES MEANS

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:43.887
THAT THESE OTHERS WE HAVE TO

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:46.623
ADDRESS THAT STATUTORILY BUT

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.091
COULD WE COULD BUT THERE IS

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:49.593
PLENTY AYE AYE THINKING WE'VE

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:51.962
JUST ADDED TO THOSE EXEMPTIONS

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:54.664
THAT WERE WERE ALLOWING FOR

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:55.966
EMERGENCIES NOW ESPECIALLY WITH

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:57.834
THE MEDICAL CENTER. SO YES IF

00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:01.037
THERE IS OVER REGENE IDEAS THAT

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:02.205
THAT COME UP YOU KNOW WE DON'T

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:05.742
KNOW HOW WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:08.345
CHANGE OVER TIME WE COULD. BED

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:10.580
TO GO BACK YOU KNOW AND HAVING

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:14.484
WORKED WITH. CENTER LARA ON

00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:18.254
THAT BILL AS. THERE ARE TWO

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.457
THINGS I WOULD SAY. ONE WE'RE

00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:23.560
TALKING ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:25.996
RIGHT I CAN THINK OF NOTHING

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:26.596
MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAT BELONGS

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:32.202
IN. THE CONSTITUTION. THEN THEN

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:35.338
THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED EQUALLY

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:36.239
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:38.908
GETTING AT HERE AND WHEN YOU

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.644
COMBINE THAT WITH WHAT WE KNOW

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.812
HAS HAPPENED SPECIFICALLY

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:44.214
AFRICAN AMERICAN WORKERS AT THE

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:49.419
UC. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE IT UP

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.788
TO CREATE OF LAWYERS I'D RATHER

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:55.158
TRUST THE VOTERS IN THE STATE

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:55.659
TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:58.528
WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT. YOU

00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:02.399
KNOW ARE VERY. LARGE EMPLOYER

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:04.200
PUBLIC INSTITUTION TO STAND BY

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:07.704
CERTAIN IDEALS SO SOMETIMES WE

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.172
IN TRYING THINGS IN THE

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:11.441
CONSTITUTION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:14.310
SO DEEPLY AND THOSE PRINCIPLES.

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:15.578
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:16.579
DOING HERE AND I'VE SEEN THINGS

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:18.948
GET PUT INTO THE CONSTITUTION I

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:19.549
DO BELIEVE THAT DEEPLY ON RAIN

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:22.919
WATER CAPTURE. I JACKIE THE

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.387
BILL BUT YOU NOW WE GOT IT IN

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:27.991
THE CONSTITUTION. THAT WAS A

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:29.859
TAX EXILE IT WAS A PLEASURE

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.828
BILL YOU KNOW IN AND THAT'S

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:33.430
OKAY BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO IT

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:34.764
THAT WAY YOU KNOW I DON'T

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:38.268
BELIEVE IT IT'S NOT MY CORE

00:55:38.334 --> 00:55:38.835
FUNCTION THE OF THE RIGHT TO

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:39.302
FISH BUT THAT'S IN OUR

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:41.571
CONSTITUTION. IT IS IN MY COURT

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:43.973
IF. INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY BY

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.241
OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SHOULD BE

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:48.611
TREATED EQUALLY. AND I THINK

00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:49.612
THAT BELONGS IN THE

00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:52.015
CONSTITUTION NOT BEHIND CLOSED

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.750
DOORS WITH CREATIVE LAWYERING

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:55.351
AND SO I THINK WHEN WE'RE

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:57.253
TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:57.854
DIFFERENCE NOW LET'S SET THAT

00:55:57.921 --> 00:56:01.124
ASIDE THAT'S- YOU KNOW. MY

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:03.293
PERSONAL BELIEF I THINK ALL OF

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:03.893
OUR BELIEFS TO BE HONEST IT'S

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.296
WET REPLIES. DO YOU SEE WAS

00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:09.199
RIGHT ON THE LARA BELL. THE

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:10.500
LUCY WAS RIGHT AND COST MORE

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:13.203
MONEY. BECAUSE THE WAY WE HAD

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:15.071
TO DO THE BUILD CONTRACTORS

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:15.672
WOULD JUST RAISE THE PRICE OF

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:19.509
THE CONTRACT. WHAT WE KNOW NOW

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:21.678
AND WHAT WE KNOW INTUITIVELY

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:25.515
BUT WE ACTUALLY NOW IS. THE ACA

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:27.917
WON'T COST MORE MONEY I WOULD

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:29.853
ASK THE UC FOR EVERY DOLLAR

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:31.788
THEY PAID FOR A CONTRACT WORKER

00:56:31.855 --> 00:56:35.291
SALARY HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY FOR

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:37.393
OVERHEAD FOR THAT CONTRACTOR. I

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.495
GUESS IT'S AROUND SIXTY SIX

00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:41.364
CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR I COULD

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:41.931
BE WRONG THEY CAN CORRECT ME

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:44.167
BUT I THINK IT'S WELL. I'M SURE

00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:48.338
WE CAN. FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:49.672
I'D SAY IT'S SIXTY SIXTY SIX

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:53.977
CENTS I'M JUST GUESSING. WE

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:56.546
IT'S NOT WE CAN SLOWLY

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:57.080
ESPECIALLY OVER TIME THESE

00:56:57.147 --> 00:57:01.184
CONTRACTS BRING THAT IN IT HE

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.719
FOR THE INCREASE IN ACTUAL

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:04.387
PEOPLE'S SALARIES AND BENEFITS

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:08.224
BEING TREATED EQUALLY. SO I

00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:10.160
CAN'T IMAGINE NOW HAVING

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.427
ALREADY YOU KNOW I SUPPORTED

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:13.429
LARS BILL AGAIN I JACQUI THAT

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:15.632
WHEN AND BELIEVED IN IT BUT

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:16.199
THIS IS ACTUALLY A PREFERRED

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:20.570
BULL. METHOD OF GOING BY

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:23.039
CREATING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. ALL

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.374
BECAUSE NUMBER ONE IT DOESN'T

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.909
SHINE IT A PRINCIPLE I THINK WE

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:27.577
ALL BELIEVE IN AND NUMBER TWO I

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:31.014
THINK THE COSTS MAKE MORE SENSE.

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:31.614

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:51.601
JUSTIFICATION OF ITS NEED FOR

ADDITIONAL OVERHEAD FUNDING WE

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:54.437

WHAT HAVE YOU. THERE'S A

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:29.906
VARIETY OF THINGS THAT GO INTO

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:32.475
THAT WE'VE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGING

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:34.310

METHODOLOGY FOR FIVE YEARS IT'S

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:50.960
BEEN CONTINUALLY SAME. WE'VE

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.362
DONE THAT FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:54.097
BEING DEFENSIBLE AND BEING

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:56.532

CONSIDERED OVERHEAD. RIGHT

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.462
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S WOULD

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:33.830
YOU WOULD YOU CATEGORIZE THOSE

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:34.864
KINDS OF EXPENSES WHEN I'M

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:36.399

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.500
OVERHEAD CENTER TALKING ABOUT

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.135
THE COST THAT THE VENDOR HAS TO

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.403
PERFORM THE CONTRACT MEANS

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.537
TOWARDS THAT OF THE FORTY

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:43.039
PERCENT. NON LABOR IN YOUR

THAT'S THAT'S THE COST WE PAY

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:53.850

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.218
THINGS THAT WE THE 30% OR THE

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:56.486
THINGS THAT WE FACTOR INTO

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:58.454
THOSE CONTRACTS. TO ENSURE THAT

01:00:58.521 --> 01:00:59.155
THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.923
DOESN'T PAY FOR THE EQUIPMENT

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.491
THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:02.325
CONTRACT OUT FOR SPECIALIZED

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:03.493

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:11.434
PURCHASE AND MAINTAIN.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.001
EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT WHETHER

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:12.502
IT'S FOR. TREE TRIMMING

WE DON'T USE ON A DAILY BASIS

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:21.044
AND SO THEREFORE WE SHOULD

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:21.811
PURCHASE THEM IN. AND MAINTAIN

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.212

OTHERWISE. PRUNING SHEARS THOSE

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:26.783

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:31.354
VALUE. SO MY POINT IS AGAIN

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:32.121
REGARDING THE GYMNAST. OPINION

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.423
IS THAT THOSE COSTS WILL

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:34.223
CONTINUE TO BE BORNE BY THE

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.592

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.661
WAGE COMPONENT. AND THE BENEFIT

EMPLOY WE'VE NOT WOULD NOT.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:44.434
HIDDEN BEHIND THIS AT ALL WE'VE

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.170
NOT BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT THIS.

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:48.337
FOLKS WHO ARE ON UNIVERSITY

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:49.138
PAYROLL UNIVERSITY PLEASE MAKE

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:50.339
MORE THAN CONTACTED STAFF. IT

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:51.274
IS THE CASE THAT PRESENT

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.309
APARTADO ESTABLISHED A FAIR

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.377

ENSURE THAT CONTACT STAFF ALL

01:01:57.947 --> 01:01:59.015
STAFF FOR THAT MATTER BUT

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.583
CERTAINLY CONTACT STAFF. WOULD

UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES EARN IS

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.659
MORE THAN THAT SO THAT'S THE

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:10.827
WAY EACH COMPONENT IT'S ABOUT A

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.595
25% INFLATOR AGAIN WE'VE BEEN

AGAIN TO THE EXTENT WE'VE BEEN

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.668
TRYING TO BE VERY DEFENSIBLE

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:20.036
AND VERY CONSERVATIVE. WE'VE

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.671
BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER ABOUT IT

BE JACQUI NUMBERS OF INFLATING

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.820
SO IT'S THOSE TWO COMPONENTS

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:38.855
THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE ON TOP

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:40.223

ONE THIRTY TWO POINT SIX PLUS

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:03.513
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WERE

CERTAINLY SYSTEM WIDE INTO THE

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:22.165
LOW MILLIONS BUT- IT'S BEEN

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:22.732
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO PUT

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:23.299
ADDITIONAL NUMBER ON THAT SO

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:27.470
WHEN YOU. GET BEFORE A FLOOR

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.573
VOTE IS THAT CERTAINLY. BECAUSE

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.541
I MEAN IN MY MIND YOU GOT THE

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:32.108
APPROPRIATIONS CHAIR HERE AS

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:33.876
THE AUTHOR. IF THERE'S A DELTA

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:36.712
TO MEET TO MAKE THIS THE TO

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:37.280
SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:41.584
THEN THAT SEEMS LIKE. AT LEAST

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.852
WORTH DOING SOME MATH AND

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:43.686
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT WOULD

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:48.925
ENTAIL END. AND I GUESS. YEAH I

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.525
MEAN THE REAL QUESTION I HAVE

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:52.929
IS ARE THESE. THESE X. X. THE

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:56.532
STATUTORY EXCEPTIONS THOUGH. AS

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:57.099
THESE ACTIONS LIKE DOES THAT

01:03:57.166 --> 01:04:01.804
COVER THE SCOPE OF WORK THAT

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.406
THAT YOUR CONCERNED YOU WON'T

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:04.740
LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY EVEN

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:07.577
PERMIT US ROOM TO STILL GO TO

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:08.177
THE SPECIAL EVENT WORK AND THE

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:11.080
LANDSCAPING WORK. WITHIN THE

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:11.681
CONTEXT THE BILL THAT WE HAVE

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:14.650
SET TO SEEK IT IN LAW. BUT IT

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:17.119
IS YOUR MATH DRIVEN BY AN

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:17.687
ASSUMPTION THAT WE WOULDN'T

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.989
TAKE ANY OF THOSE EXCEPTIONS.

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.791
YOU SEE I'M SAYING YEAH OUR OUR

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:23.526
VIEW IS THAT THOSE EXEMPTIONS

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:24.894
IF ALL FIVE WERE TO BE APPROVED

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.462
AS THEY'RE WRITTEN ON THE PAGE

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.864
TODAY THAT THOSE WOULD ACCOUNT

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.466
TO PROVIDE FOR PERHAPS MAYBE

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.901
FIVE PERCENT. OF THE OVERALL

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:33.736
AMOUNT OF CONTRACTING OUT

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:35.004
ACTIVITIES OCCUR IN A GIVEN

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:37.206
YEAR AND SO WHILE THE

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:38.808
EXEMPTIONS ARE ARE SOME

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:41.310
FLEXIBILITY THE PROBLEM IS THE

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.146
OTHER 95% IS THE OTHER. SELECT

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.681
PROHIBITION YEAH LIKE WHAT

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.483
OTHER STUFF WELL THERE'S ALL

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.851
THE VARIETY OF ISSUES TAKE

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:50.186
PLACE IN THE HOSPITAL AND ARE

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.420
NOT NECESSARILY DRIVEN BY AN

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.789
EMERGENCY. I THINK THE DOCTOR

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:55.591
WAS TESTIFYING THAT THERE'S

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:56.859
CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THROUGHOUT

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.227
THE YEAR THROUGHOUT THE WEEK

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.396
WHERE PATIENT ACUITY PATIENTS

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.664
SEVERITY FLUCTUATES AND MAYBE

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.065
WANT TO JUMP IN HERE BUT IT

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.634
SAYS WHICH MAY INCLUDE ENSURING

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.801
THE CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS OF

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.036
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:10.773
PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE TO

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.274
ADDRESS LIFE THREATENING

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:15.344
SITUATIONS DURING AN EMERGENCY.

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:17.380
COMMA FOR NO LONGER THE ACTUAL

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:18.147
DURATION OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:19.749
EAT IT IT SEEMS TO. AT LEAST

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:20.216
ONE ADDRESS CONTINUOUS

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:20.650
OPERATIONS IN THOSE

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:23.619
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT- WHAT'S THE-

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.288
BUT THE ISSUE I THINK THE

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:26.689
QUESTION IS AN EMERGENCY IN AN

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.691
EMERGENCY ROOM SITUATION BUT IS

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.159
NOT LIMITED TO WITH THE WITH

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:31.227
THE CHAIR SUGGEST SORRY I THINK

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.462
WE WOULD ARGUE THAT EMERGENCY

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:33.996
ROOM SITUATION OR EVEN A

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.665
GENERAL HOSTILE SITUATION UP.

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:40.236
EMERGENCIES. IT'S EVERYDAY'S

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:41.304
NOT EMERGENCY EVERY DAY IS JUST

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:42.538
THE STANDARD. ROUTINE IT'S

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.105
REQUIRED IN HOSPITAL TO CARE

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.540
FOR PATIENTS YOU WOULDN'T BE IN

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:45.641
OTHER WORDS NIMBLE ENOUGH TO

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:47.109
SEARCH THEY COULD YOU WOULDN'T

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:47.810
BE THEY ANTICIPATE THE

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:50.579
EMERGENCY SO EVEN IF YOU ADDED

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:51.213
A THORNY IN SOME SENSE TO DO IT

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.184
YOU COULDN'T. THIS EXEMPTION AS

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:56.285
OUTLINED IN THIS BILL AT THIS

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:56.819
POINT DOESN'T PROVIDE THE

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:57.787
LIMITS DOESN'T BY THE-

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:58.788
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:00.222
FLEXIBILITY TO CONDUCT THE

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.856
DAILY AFFAIRS THAT. REQUIRED IN

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:03.726
A HOSPITAL OR ON THE CAMPUS.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.062
CAN I JUST BEFORE I WRAP UP AND

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:06.896
THANK YOU FOR ALL FOR THE

01:06:06.962 --> 01:06:09.332
INDULGENCE HERE BUT JUST FROM.

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:10.366
ADDRESS ME OR THE AUTHOR'S

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:12.668
PERSPECTIVE. HOW DO YOU WHAT

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.103
WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE FUTURE

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.705
OF SAY THAT EMERGENCY ROOM LOOK

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.139
LIKE TO YOU. UNDER THIS EQUAL

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:22.378
EMPLOYMENT. REGIME ACTIVELY

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:23.646
WALK ME THROUGH THAT SAME KIND

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.580
OF CIRCUMSTANCE OR HAVE LIKE

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:26.916
HOW IT IS ORGANIZED SORT OF

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:29.418
CONTEXT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:31.921
BETTER BECAUSE I GUESS IT'S NOT

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:33.622
EVEN WORKING RIGHT NOW SO IT'S

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:34.290
NOT IS IT YES WELL THAT I THINK

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:36.425
THAT'S A THERE IS NOTHING THAT

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.060
THE DOCTOR SAID THAT I DISAGREE

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.795
WITH BUT THAT'S UNDER THE

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.764
CURRENT REGIME WE HAVE THIS

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.565
PROBLEM WHERE THEY HAVE

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.433
CONTRACTED WORKERS WHERE THEY

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.801
HAVE FLEXIBILITY WHERE THEY

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:48.471
UTILIZE CONTRACT WORKERS SO

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:51.674
STAFFING ISSUES WILL ALWAYS BE

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:52.842
AN ISSUE WHETHER THOSE ARE

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.845
CONTRACTED STAFF OR EMPLOYEES

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.179
OF THE UNIVERSITY I THINK

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:59.515
THAT'S CLEAR. WHEN YOU BRING UP

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:02.184
A CASE THAT IS CURRENTLY

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.220
PROBLEMATIC I MEAN UNLESS SHE'S

01:07:04.286 --> 01:07:05.921
ARE AND I DIDN'T HEAR THIS

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:06.756
UNLESS SHE'S ARGUING THAT IN

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:09.859
FACT WE CONTRACT OUT MORE WORK

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:11.927
THAT WOULD DEFEAT I THINK THE

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:14.363
UC'S KIND OF POSITION AND ANY

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:15.598
ASSURANCES WE HAVE FOR THE

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:19.001
FUTURE AND PERHAPS IT DOES

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:23.739
HIGHLIGHT. HI THIS HAS TO BE.

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:24.340
IN TRYING TO THE CONSTITUTION

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:25.441
AND WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:26.008
IS BECAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.042
GOING TO BE THESE TYPES OF

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.910
PRESSURES NOT JUST THAT YOU SEE

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:29.745
BUT ANY HOSPITAL. IN DEALING

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:33.282
WITH STAFF TEEN. AS APPROPRIATE

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.417
STAFFING LEVELS IS SOMETHING WE

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:35.484
DEAL WITH IT HOSPITALS I MEAN

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:37.086
WE DO A LOT BILLS ON THAT SO

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.854
OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN ISSUE. I

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:40.156
DON'T THINK THAT HAS ANYTHING

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:42.024
TO DO WITH THE CONTRACTED OUT

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:42.691
ISSUE I THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE

01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:44.593
THAT THE CHAIR HAS. OFFERED UP

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.162
AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.830
PROVIDES MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:51.400
FOR. FOR HOSPITALS YOU KNOW IN

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.067
IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:56.372
NEED. MORE AT CONTRACT BUT I'M

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:58.140
NOT IT I FEEL LIKE WHERE WE

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:59.308
HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.242
GOING ON ONE WHICH WE ALWAYS

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.044
NEED TO ADDRESS DOES YOU SEE ME

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:04.079
MORE MONEY YES I THINK WE DEAL

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:07.883
WITH THIS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IS

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:08.517
THAT DIFFERENT THAN HOW THEY'RE

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:12.488
USING THAT MONEY. AND HOW WE'RE

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:14.557
TREATING. WORKERS AND PEOPLE

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.324
WHETHER THEY WORK FOR THE

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:20.229
UNIVERSITY VERSUS A CONTRACTOR.

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:21.363
THERE LEYVA ONSTAR CENTERS

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.364
RIGHT MY FINAL POINT WOULD JUST

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.166
BE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAN

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:24.800
WE'VE BEEN STARVING THE YOU SEE

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:27.136
FOR TOO LONG. AND THAT'S FOR

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.070
STUDENTS PROFESSORS WORKERS IS

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:29.104
THE GRACE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:29.905
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD AND I'M-

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:35.277
I'M. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:37.213
FUTURE THIS SYSTEM ADDED

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.048
STARTING TO ATROPHY AND FALL

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:41.450
APART ON THE CAPITAL SIDE

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:45.488
PERSONNEL STUDENTS YOU KNOW THE

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:48.924
FIFTY PRESSURES OUT THERE SO.

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:49.458
I'M I'M I'M SUPPORTING THE

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:54.096
MEASURE. AND I WANT TO SEE SOME

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.397
MORE INFORMATION BEFORE THE

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:56.999
FLOOR I REALLY I HOPE WE CAN

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:58.968
GET SOME SOME BETTER MATH AND

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:01.103
REALLY KEEP US INFORMED ABOUT

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:02.771
WHAT THE FINANCIAL COMMITMENT

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.773
UNDERLYING THIS VOTE IS I

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.175
GUESS. RIGHT IF WE'RE GONNA GO

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.110
ALL THE WAY WITH ISN'T GOING TO

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:08.644
CONSTITUTION WHAT ARE WE

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:11.413
OBLIGATING OURSELVES TO AND HOW

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.982
DO WE GET REAL ABOUT THAT IS A

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.083
LEGISLATURE SAY OKAY WE'RE

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.384

WE'RE PUSH YOU DO YOU DO YOUR

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:20.689
PART AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

TO ME I MEAN IF I CAN GO IN

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:25.427
THIS EYES WIDE OPEN. ON THAT

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:27.263
MATH IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT VOTE

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:34.336
THEN. THEN JUST ON YOU KNOW A

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:35.638
COMPLETE YOUR YOUR COMPETING

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.273
YEAH YOUR COMPETING SUPPOSITION

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.607
ABOUT WHAT'S UNDERLYING GYMNAST

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.576
AND WE NEED SOMETHING MORE TO

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.144
GO ON HERE WE KNOW THAT IT IS

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.013
JUST CAME TO YOU SO YOU CAN

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:44.547
TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO THE

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.382
HOMEWORK BUT THAT WOULD BE VERY

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:46.949
HELPFUL ANY OTHER. THANK YOU

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:48.751

THE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:55.457
DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:56.091
THAT WE ARE STARVING THE UC'S

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.560
WE COULD PROBABLY GIVE THEM

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.295
MORE MONEY BUT I THINK IT'S THE

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:00.763
WAY THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY THAT

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:04.466
IS SOMETIMES OF THE ISSUE I

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.101
JUST WANT TO REINFORCE WHAT THE

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.103
AUTHOR SAID IN TRYING THIS IN

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.139
THE CONSTITUTION IS A STATEMENT

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.374
OF OUR BELIEFS AND OUR VALUES I

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.143
THINK THAT IS ONE ISSUE BUT I

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.211
THINK THE OTHER ISSUE IS AS

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:16.712
SOMEONE WHO NEGOTIATED

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:18.714
CONTRACTS FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.549
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T DO THE

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:21.383
RIGHT THING TO FORCE THEM TO DO

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.952
THE RIGHT THING THE UC HAS HAD

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.086
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE RIGHT

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:26.221

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.965
COMPANIES THAT I BARGAINED WITH

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:37.232
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS EVER WENT

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:38.934
OUT OF BUSINESS THEY ONLY

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:40.436
INCREASE THEIR PROFITS ARE ONLY

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:42.071
MAKING MORE AND MORE MONEY BUT

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.039
EVERY TIME WE NEGOTIATE IT'S

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.040
ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY IT'S

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:46.775
NEVER ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHEN ARE

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:47.710
WE GOING TO MAKE IT ABOUT THE

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:48.444
PEOPLE WHEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE

TRYING TO FEED THEIR FAMILY.

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.081
THE WORKERS WHO WOULD LOVE

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.616
MAYBE SOMEBODY FOR THEIR CHILD

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:54.183
TO GET TO GO TO THIS

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.086

DONE ON THIS ACA BEFORE IT.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:45.394
ULTIMATELY COMES OF THE FLOOR

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.963
THE SENATE I HAVE A HISTORY IN

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.699
THIS AREA ALTHOUGH I'M ONLY

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:51.934
THIRTY YEARS OLD TWENTY EIGHT

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:52.634
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN THE

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:55.270

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:56.605
THIS ISSUE WITH YOU SEE I WHEN

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.107
THE GROUNDS KEEPERS ARE ABOUT

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:01.543
TO GO ON STRIKE BECAUSE OF

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.112

IT WAS A CHANCE FOR THE TIME.

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:09.284
WE WORKED OUT A COMPROMISE THAT

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:11.186
WAS ACCEPTABLE AT LEAST FOR

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:14.823
THE- OF FOR THE NEXT DECADE. SO

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.592
I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS I

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:18.961
THINK THAT THIS IS. AN

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.362
IMPORTANT MEASURE BUT I ALSO

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:22.598
THINK IT IS IT IS REMAINS A

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:25.367
WORK IN PROGRESS. SO WITHOUT

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.336

CENTER LEYVA MOVES. ANY OTHER

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:38.680

LOOMING IT'S ALSO IT'S LIKE

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:46.722
CLOSE THAT'S OKAY I'LL BE BRIEF

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:47.823
I ALSO A UCLA LAW GRADUATE I

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:48.891
HAD MY DAUGHTER AT UCLA MEDICAL

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.125
CENTER AND I THINK THE AFFINITY

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.394
WE HAVE FOR YOU SEE. ALL OF US

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:55.731
IN THIS BODY IT IS CLEAR. I

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.099
ALSO HAVE AN AFFINITY FOR EQUAL

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.534
OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK WE

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.936

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:03.705
THAT WE SUGGEST THAT THEY'RE

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.941
EXEMPT FROM OUR PRINCIPLES OF

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:09.011
BASIC DIGNITY AND EQUALITY. SO

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.846
WITH THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:11.580
REASONS FOR BRINGING THIS

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:14.116
FORWARD I ALSO WANT TO POINT

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:15.184
OUT AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.152
IN THIS I'M SURE WILL BE AN

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:17.753
ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.455
OVERHEAD AND TRAINING AND- AS

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:23.325
AS THE CONTRACTS DECREASE THEY

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:24.393
RUN OUT BECAUSE WE IT'LL- TAKE

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:28.597
OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IN AND

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:29.398
PEOPLE ARE IN SOURCED IF YOU

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:32.434
WILL THOSE COSTS GO DOWN AND WE

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:36.138
KNOW THAT IN SO. A LOT OF COST

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:37.306
RIGHT NOW ARE DUPLICATIVE.

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:40.576
TRAINING HAPPENS WHETHER YOU'RE.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:43.245
EMPLOYEE OR OR YOU'RE NOT

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:47.049
THERE'S OFTEN SAVINGS AND SCALE.

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:50.085
LONG TERM ACQUIRING THE TYPE

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:53.388
OF. THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:54.790
YOUR JOB WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:57.793

BRING IN THEIR OWN MRI. HEY WE

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:03.298
STILL HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT SO A

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:06.468
LOT OF THIS BECOMES A LESSER OF

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:10.105
A COST IN OVERHEAD AND I THINK

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.206
WHAT WE FOUND FROM THE AUDITOR

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:14.843
FROM THE FORMER TO. DEPARTMENT

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:15.878
OF FINANCE DIRECTOR IS THAT IN

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.746
FACT MAYBE WE HAVEN'T BEEN SO

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:18.881
HONEST ABOUT THE COST OF

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:21.450
OUTSOURCING AND THAT THIS

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:23.185
MEASURE COULD ACTUALLY HELP US

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:25.420
HELP YOU SEE SAVE SOME MONEY.

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:26.555
