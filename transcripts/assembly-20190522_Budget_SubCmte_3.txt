GARCIA MULLIN [inaudible] PATTERSON [inaudible] REYES [inaudible] RIVAS. WELCOME EVERYONE TO THE FINAL MEETING OF ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER. THREE IT'S A IT'S BEEN A GOOD YEAR AND IT -- I WANNA THANK. ALL OF YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR HEARINGS BY PARTICULARLY WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES AND THE STAFF THAT WORKS OUT REALLY HARD -- TO INFORMANT ADVISED US OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR ON THE MANY COMPLICATED ISSUES THAT WEEK -- SEE BEFORE US HERE AND AND SUB THREE SO -- THANK THANK YOU ALL FOR THE HARD WORK THAT YOU. HAVE DONE UP UNTIL NOW AND I KNOW OF COURSE -- ONCE WE FINISH OUR WORK -- HERE THIS MORNING YOU'VE GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO DO ON ON THE BUDGET TO GETTING US THROUGH TO A WHAT I'M SURE WILL BE ANOTHER -- ON TIME FINISH -- OR BEFORE JUNE FIFTEENTH SO WITH THAT -- WE WILL -- CALL THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR I HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THAT FIRST ON ISSUE NUMBER. TWO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION REFERENCES PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE -- BUT THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND WHEN -- WE ENTERTAIN A OF A VOTE ON THAT -- WILL REFERENCE SAID THAT THAT CHANGE IN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION -- BUT BEFORE I ASK FOR A MOTION ON THAT -- ISSUE I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE -- UP UP GEN BASICALLY APPROVING THE ITEM TODAY WITH THE THAT -- WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUT I REMAIN CONCERNED WITH THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE TIMBER RIGHT. REGULATION THE FORCED RESTORATION FUND AN ANNUAL REPORT IS REQUIRED EACH YEAR ON JANUARY TENTH. THAT REPORT WOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ON COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVIEW APPROVAL AND INSPECTION OF TIMBER HARVEST PLANS AND ASSOCIATED PERMITS. THE NUMBER OF TIMBER HARVEST PLANS -- THE ACREAGE THAT'S COVERED BY THE PLANS THE COST OF OTHER FORESTRY RELATED ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN A SUMMARY OF THE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AS PART OF THEIR ONGOING REVIEW OF THE TIMBER HARVEST PROCESS -- AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE DATA AND TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENT NEEDS. OF THE LAST THREE YEARS THE THE RUB THE THE LAST REPORT THAT WAS SUBMITTED WAS IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN REPORTS ARE NOW VERY PASSED TO AND SO I JUST WANT -- TO TELEGRAPHER -- CONCERN HERE AND HOPE THAT THE RESOURCES AGENCY IS PUT ON NOTICE THAT -- AT THIS COMMITTEE EXPECTS THIS OF MIDDLE OF THE REPORT TO IN THE VERY NEAR TERM. ALL OF THESE REPORTS. OF ONE ISSUE NUMBER -- SEVEN THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER ITEMS -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK YOU ALL KNOW IS. NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART I'VE WORKED ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I THINK THIS SUBCOMMITTEE GENERALLY SHARES A CONCERN -- ABOUT THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY -- AND SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE. RESIDENTS ARE A LIVING IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN IT RELATES TO WATER -- THAT IS MUCH LIKE DEVELOPING NATIONS THERE ARE IN FACT. OVER THREE HUNDRED ON SAFE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA CONTAINS A SOME IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY -- AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND THEREFORE RELY ON PURCHASING WATER AND HAULING IT INTO THEIR HOMES -- THAT'S JUST -- UNFATHOMABLE A IN THIS DAY AND AGE AND SO WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE FRAMEWORK TO PERMANENTLY SOLVE THE CRISIS. THERE ARE SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE MEASURES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION I AM THE AUTHOR OF ONE OF THEM -- BUT AS WEIRD THE DIFFERING QUÃ© -- OTHER CREATION OF A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM -- TO THE POLICY PROCESS TO ALLOW THOSE BILLS TO MOVE FORWARD -- BUT I DO WANT TO REITERATE MY OF A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE NOT YET RESOLVED THIS ISSUE AND AND WE MUST. WE HAVE THREE BUDGET REQUEST REGARDING WILDFIRES IN UTILITIES THAT WILL TAKE ACTIONS ON THAT REFLECT OUR CONCERNS ABOUT APPROVING FUNDING FOR NEW ACTIVITIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. FOR THE DMV WE ADOPT A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT PLAN THAT ENSURES THE FUND BALANCE REMAINS HEALTHY AND IS ABLE TO FUND OUR PRIORITIES. FOR THE DMV BUDGET REQUEST FOR FUNDING TO IMPROVE ITS OVERALL OPERATIONS WE TAKE ACTIONS THAT WILL HOLD THE DMV ACCOUNTABLE FOR APPROVING A FOR IMPROVING ITS PERFORMANCE. AND FINALLY FOR CAP AND TRADE WE ARE ADOPTING AN EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT REFLECTS OUR HIGH LEVEL PRIORITIES IT DOESN'T GET INTO QUITE THE DETAIL THAT -- WE'RE ALL USED -- TO FROM PASS BUDGETS BUT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON THE HIGH LEVEL PRIORITIES. AND THE OF COURSE SO WILL CONTINUE WITHIN THOSE HIGH LEVEL PRIORITIES TO CONSIDER ALL THE NUANCES IN THE PROGRAMS -- THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE ADVOCATED OVER THE OVER THE THE YEARS. AS A TECHNICAL ISSUE FOR VOTE ONLY ISSUE TWENTY TWO WE'RE GOING TO MODIFY THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IN THE AGENDA. AND APPROVE CASH FUNDING FOR THE CHP CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAMS FOR EL CENTRO AND SAN BERNARDINO. AND REJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS FOR THOSE TWO PROJECTS -- AND WE WILL APPROVE THE REVERSION OF THE FUNDING FOR THE HAYWARD PROJECT AND REJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO FINANCE THE COST OF THIS PROJECT. ON UP WITH THAT IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE. MS GARCIA DID YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND IF ANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD SOME COMMENTS -- PLEASE LET ME KNOW MISSY ELLIOTT THANK YOU -- CHAIR -- I WILL BE VOTING FOR ITEM A BUT I I DID JUST WANT TO MAKE A QUICK STATEMENT THAT I HOPE. IN THE FUTURE WE START LOOKING AT THESE LOANS -- FOR THE EXACT CLEAN UP AND WE START THINKING ABOUT THE MATH ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS -- WE ARE A LITTLE BIT FLUSH WITH CASH AT THIS TIME -- BUT IN ADDITION TO THESE LOANS SHOULD NOT CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE SINCE WE HAVE A BATTERY FEE FUND. WILL BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE CLEANUP THROUGH THERE AND SO JUST A I HOPE THAT WE START CONSIDERING THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I MAILED I KNOW THE COMMITMENT IN THIS HOUSE BUT TO SAY THAT TO EVERYONE ELSE'S NAME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ANYONE ELSE ALL RIGHT THEN -- IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE. ISSUES ONE THROUGH. THREE A AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE TO LET THEM NOT I'M NOT.

THANK YOU THAT CONCLUDES THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR WE HAVE ONE ITEM TO BE HEARD -- CONSERVATION GENOMICS THAT'S ISSUE ONE AND I BELIEVE -- DR MARKEL DOES HERE TOO PRESENT [inaudible] THE STATE. WE SO LONG EVERYONE THANK YOU. TURN TAKE IT PERSONALLY DR GOLD. I DON'T EVEN THIRDTIME YEAH HI I'M NOT WHY WOULD YOU PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK ABOUT RESEARCH TO CONSERVE CALIFORNIA'S UNPARALLELED NATURAL RESOURCES. AND WHILE I FOR A CHANGING FUTURE IN THE FACE THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THIS MONTH -- THE UNITED NATIONS RELEASED THE SUMMARY FINDINGS OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE BY DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT TODAY. AND THESE FINDINGS WERE WENT FAR BEYOND SOBERING. AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION ANIMAL AND PLANT SPECIES ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION. AND THESE UNPARALLELED LOSSES. I'M IN HUMAN HISTORY ARE DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITY ON A QUICKLY WARMING CLIMATE HABITAT LOSS POLLUTION AND MORE HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THOSE TRIED BOXES. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ONE OF THE PLANET'S BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS ONE OF THIRTY FIVE OF THEM. YEAH UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES. AN EVEN GREATER NUMBER OF SPECIES HABITATS AND ECOSYSTEMS ARE UNDER THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE HABITAT LAST LOSS AND MORE. I'M HERE TODAY AS A SCIENTIST ON THE ON FOR YOU DON'T KNOW FROM MY BACKGROUND ON I'M ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR ENVIRONMENT SUSTAINABILITY ON AT UCLA. ON AND I'M ALSO A FACULTY MEMBER ON THE NEEDS TO BE ENVIRONMENT SUSTAINABILITY. BUT I'M HERE TODAY AS A SCIENTIST TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CONSERVATION BIOLOGY BIOLOGY TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED TO BETTER. MANAGE CALIFORNIA'S PRECIOUS BY DIVERSITY. THE FIELD OF CONSERVATION GENOMICS ALLOW SCIENTISTS TO IDENTIFY SPECIES AND POPULATIONS THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO HABITAT LOSS. ENTER CLIMATE CHANGE THESE POPULATIONS THOSE POPULATIONS WITH THE GREATEST GENETIC VARIABILITY ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO ADAPT TO ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THESE TOOLS ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY. ON THOSE RESILIENT POPULATIONS. TO DATE YOU SEE SCIENTISTS. I WORKED ON APPROXIMATELY FORTY SPECIES RANGING FROM OAKS TO MIGRATING BIRDS TO FISH AND REPTILES. THIS INFORMATION IS CRITICAL TO DETERMINE POSSIBLE LOCATIONS FOR CITING RENEWABLE ENERGY. FACILITIES SO THEY BECAUSE A MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL HARM. GENOMICS ALSO ENABLES US TO MAKE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION DECISIONS. THE CONSERVATION SONOMA TOOLS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO RESERVE CALIFORNIA'S BY DIVERSITY. USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH CLIMATE MODELING AND REMOTE SENSING THE STATE CAN BUILD CLIMATE RESILIENCE INTO OUR NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. CONSERVANCY'S CAN PURCHASE LANCE NOT BASED ON JUST THE STATE OF THE LAND TODAY. BUT ON PROJECTIONS OF WHAT THE LAND WILL BE LIKE AT THE END OF THE CENTURY. ALL OF THESE FIELDS ARE INSTRUMENTAL TO A MORE MODERN APPROACH TO HAS OUR MANAGEMENT FROM WILD FIRE AND FLOOD. INTO A RESTAURANT RESTORATION ECOLOGY APPROACH TO LIMIT ON FUTURE DAMAGES. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER ON SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION IN CONSERVATION BIOLOGY IS NO DIFFERENT. ALL TEN UC'S HAVE RESEARCHERS WORKING IN THE FIELDS I'VE DESCRIBED. AND WE STAND BY READY TO WORK WITH STATE AGENCIES THE LEGISLATURE IN THE CAPITAL. ON THE STATE WIDE RESEARCH EFFORT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHER ANY QUESTIONS IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THE SIDE.
