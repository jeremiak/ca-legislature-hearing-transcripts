THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING AB STE. PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT FEW INDUSTRIES ARE MORE INDELIBLY TIED TO A LOCATION IN THE IN A TENER INTO ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS THE CALIFORNIA. THIS INDUSTRY CREATES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND BILLIONS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR AND AS. AND HOPEFULS STILL FLOCK TO THE AREA WITH DREAMS OF BEING DISCOVERED. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES OTHER STATES AND AND COUNTRIES HAVE LORD PRODUCTION OUT OF CALIFORNIA WITH GENEROUS TAX BREAKS IN THOSE YEARS OF RUNAWAY PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA SUFFERED. MASSIVE LOSSES OF JOBS REVENUE INVESTMENT AND THE EROSION OF THE FILM INDUSTRY THE TOLL ON WORKERS AND FAMILIES WITH THE MEN SAYS FILM CREW MEMBER CREW MEMBERS. TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES FOLLOWING WORK LEAVING BEHIND THEIR FAMILIES AND FACED UNEMPLOYMENT HERE AT HOME. AN EFFORT TO COMBAT PRODUCTION FLIGHT LEGISLATURE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPROVED UPON OVER THE YEARS. INCLUDING REPLACING THE OLD LOTTERY SYSTEM WITH THE JOBS RATIO RANKING SYSTEM WHEREBY APPLICATIONS ARE RANKED BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED. AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS PROVIDING SPECIAL INCENTIVES TO LARA TELEVISION PROGRAMS BACK TO THE STATE. MOVE THE BILL. THE PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT INCENTIVES I'M READING AT ALL OF THE CREATION OF THE GOOD MIDDLE CLASS BELOW THE LINE JOBS FOR WORKERS. WHO DO TECHNICAL WORK CREATING PROPS? BUILDING SETS APPLYING MAKE UP FINDING LOCATIONS AND ALL THE WORK BEHIND THE SCENES THAT MAKES PRODUCTION POSSIBLE THE BENEFITS EXTEND BEYOND THE THOUSANDS EMPLOYED THE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION TO THE ANCILLARY BUSINESSES THAT SERVE THE PRODUCTION SITES IN TEAMS. SUCH AS THE CATERERS HOTELS SET CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES RESTAURANTS ETCETERA FURTHER THE STATE AS A WHOLE BENEFITS AS THE TAX. REVENUE GENERATED FROM FILMING HERE HERE HELPS TO PAY FOR TEACHERS POLICE OFFICERS AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF CREATING A RETAINING JOBS IN THE FILM INDUSTRY IN FACT THE FILM COMMISSION RECENTLY COMPLETED. ALL ALLOCATIONS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ACCORDING TO THE PROGRAM THEIR THE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM TO POINT OUT. WE HAVE ALLOCATED EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY APPROVED PROJECTS TOGETHER THESE PROJECTS CAN ARE CONTRIBUTING FIVE POINT NINE BILLION. OF DIRECT IN STATE SPENDING INCLUDING TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN WAGES TO THE TECHNICAL CREW AND THIS EXCLUDES ANY WAGES PAID FOR WRITERS DIRECTORS PRODUCERS ARE ACTORS AS THOSE WAGES ARE NOT. ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS AS FOR JOBS WHICH IS WHAT THIS TAX CREDIT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT WE'VE SEEN A TWELVE PERCENT INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED. TWENTY NINE THOUSAND CAST MEMBERS HIRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CREW MEMBERS HIRED IN ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BACKGROUND HIRES WHICH ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HIRED ON A DAILY BASIS. WE'VE ALSO HAD THIRTEEN TV SERIES WOULD RELOCATE TO CALIFORNIA FROM OUT OF STATE. THREE SERIES MOVED FROM NEW YORK FOR FROM VANCOUVER THE REST CAME FROM NORTH CAROLINA MARYLAND TEXAS LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA THE CURRENT PROGRAM SUNSET IN TWO YEARS ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION DECISIONS REGARDING SHOOT LOCATIONS ARE MADE OFTEN A YEAR OR MORE IN ADVANCE. MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS IN NEED THE CERTAINTY OF THAT CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IN ORDER TO CONSIDER CALIFORNIA. AS A LOCATION AND THE PRODUCTION PLANNING WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY HEARING THIS BILL AND WORKING ON IT THIS YEAR. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR WILL CONTINUE THE EXISTING PROGRAM WITH SOME IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL WE WILL FURTHER INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF CALIFORNIA MUSICIANS FOR FILM AND TELEVISION SCORING AS WELL AS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CREDIT TO PRODUCTIONS. THAT FILM OUTSIDE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO ENSURE THAT THE ENTIRE STATE IS A BENEFICIARY. FINALLY THIS BILL WHICH WILL CREATE A CAREER PATHWAYS TRAINING PROGRAM FOCUSED ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. THE CAREER PATHWAYS TRAINING PROGRAM. WILL CREATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF WELL PAID HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS IN OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES AND MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S FILMMAKING WORKFORCE REMAINS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE INDUSTRY. WHILE BEING MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR STATES DIVERSE POPULATION AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR WILL CONTINUE TO RESTORE CALIFORNIA'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR FILM AND TELEVISION AND IN TELEVISION PRODUCTION. AND TO BRING JOBS BACK TO CALIFORNIA THUS ENSURING THAT THIS VIBRANT FOUNDATIONAL INDUSTRY REMAINS PART OF CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AFTER MY GREAT COLLEAGUE JOINT AUTHORS TO ME MEMBER BLOOM AND MAKES HIS REMARKS ARE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MARK WALTER THE DIRECTOR OF STUDIO DEVELOPMENT.

MR BLOWN. FORMER MEMBER MISTER BLOW A HOLE MORE MEMBERS. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. MEMBERS OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT COMMITTEE OF I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING GOD OF MISTER CALDERON FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND AS WELL THE BROAD COALITION OF ADVOCATES HAVE WORKED HARD. TO UP UP PULL THIS TOGETHER I WAS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF VERSION TWO POINT OUT IT HAS BEEN AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS AND CALIFORNIA'S. FILM INDUSTRIES YOU ALL THOSE ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF OUR GREAT STATE IT EMPLOYS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN ITS CREATED INCREDIBLE CULTURAL AND ARTISTIC TOUCHSTONES. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY HAS FOR YEARS BEEN MOVING TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY DUE PRIMARILY TO INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN. OF OTHER STATES AND. INTERNATIONALLY AS WELL. OUR TWENTY FOURTEEN REVISION OF THE FILM TAX CREDIT AS I SAID IT'S BEEN AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS IN HELPING REVERSE THAT TREND AND BREATHING LIFE INTO AN INDUSTRY THAT WAS. BORN IN RICHARD HERE AND IT HAS BEEN A MAINSTAY OF OUR ECONOMY FOR MANY MANY DECADES NOW. OVER THE FIRST TWO YEARS SINCE THE NEW TAX CREDITS AUTHORIZATION IT GENERATED THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT SPENDING ACROSS THE STATE. ONE POINT FOUR BILLION OF THOSE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN FOR BELOW THE LINE WAGES LIKE THOSE FOR COULD ACCRUE AND PRODUCTION MEMBERS THESE ARE WELL PAYING TYPICALLY UNION JOBS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE. WELL WE CELEBRATE OUR SUCCESS WE CANNOT REST ON OUR LAURELS WHY BECAUSE WERE FACED WITH CONTINUING EFFORTS TO LURE FILM AND CONTENT PRODUCTION ELSEWHERE. AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON CALIFORNIA TO TAKE STEPS TO ASSURE THAT WE RETAIN OUR PLACE AS THE HOME OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. THAT IS WHY I AM A BIG SUPPORTER OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. FIGURE FORMER CHAIR KNOWN WAS SAPPING TESTIMONY. TOM FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK CHAIRPERSON CHU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. MONEY IT'S MARK WALTER NOT I REPRESENT FILMER ISLAND SIMILES. FILMER ISLAND WAS CREATED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. AND RIGHT NOW IS COMPRISED OF A NUMBER OF BUILDINGS ON MARE ISLAND WHICH IS IN THE CITY OF VALLEJO. OUR OUR PHASE ONE OF THE PROJECT WITH TO TAKE THESE OLD NAVY BUILDINGS. THAT WERE MOTHBALL FOR MANY YEARS IMPROVE AND REALIZE THEM. I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE PUT THE RESOURCES BACK INTO THESE OLD BUILDINGS. AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO BRING THEM BACK TO LIFE. IT'S BEEN A CATALYST OF REVITALIZATION FOR THE ENTIRE AREA. AND THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE REPURPOSE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THAT WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. FOR USE BY PRODUCTION COMPANIES. WE CURRENTLY OTHER HIT PARAMOUNT TELEVISION PROJECT ON THE ISLAND. AND AS NFL'S OTHER LARGE PRODUCTION SINCE OPENING OUR DOORS. INCLUDING A PARAMOUNT FEATURE FILM PROJECT THIS SUMMER THAT WAS LOOKING AT GOING TO GEORGIA BUT DECIDED ON STAINING CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE TAX CREDITS. TOM I GREW UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE BEEN IN THE STUDIO MANAGEMENT BUSINESS FOR OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS. AND DUE TO THE TAX INCENTIVES AND OTHER STATES SUCH AS GEORGIA NEW MEXICO LOUISIANA. AND OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS. CANADA AND THE UK. NAM. OFFERING TAX INCENTIVES I'VE SEEN A MASS EXODUS OF PROJECTS TO THESE OTHER STATES. AND UNFORTUNATELY OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL. A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS AGO AFTER CALIFORNIA BACK TO THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM I BEGIN TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT SURPRISE IF THERE WERE NOT ANY LARGE PURPOSE BUILT SOUND STAGES IN THE AREA. WE GET A MARKET STUDY AND DECIDED THAT WE WOULD FIND A SUITABLE LOCATION. TEST THE WATERS AND IF THINGS WORK OUT BUILT SOME NEW SOUND STAGES. CURRENTLY WE ARE WAITING FOR THE CITY TO APPROVE OUR PROPOSAL TO BILL THREE ADDITIONAL SOUND STAGES. AND PRODUCTION SUPPORT BUILDINGS. ONCE COMPLETED WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE MULTIPLE PROJECTS FILMING AT THE SAME TIME. WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO COMPETE WITH STUDIOS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW ONE TV SHOW CAN MAKE AN IMPACT. A TV SERIES THIRTEEN REASONS WHY. SPEND APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN SOLANO IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTIES DURING THEIR FIRST SEASON. IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE EXPECT THAT PRODUCTION SPENDING. DOUBLE THAN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN THOSE SAME COUNTIES. ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT PRODUCTION HAD APPROX ME FORTY FIFTY PEOPLE WORKING ON THE ISLAND WHILE BOTH SHOWS ARE FILMING IN AUGUST. NAM. IN CLOSING. WE FIND OURSELVES COMPETING WITH NOT ONLY THE STATES THAT I MENTIONED BUT OTHER COUNTRIES ALL OFFERING ATTRACTIVE TAX INCENTIVES WITHIN ESTABLISH INFRASTRUCTURE LABOR POOL. WE NEED THESE TAX CREDITS TO NOT ONLY CONTINUE BUT ALSO IMPROVE SO THAT BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A FAIR SHOT TO BRING PRODUCTIONS HOME. WHERE IT BELONGS? A WE'RE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN THE NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WITHOUT THAT CERTAINTY OF THE TAX INCENTIVE WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR INDUSTRY. THE MONEY. MY NAME IS ALLISON TAYLOR. AND I THINK MAJORITY LEADER. UP CALDERON AND CHAIRMAN CHIU AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. I HAVE. I HAVE. AT WORK DID THE LOCATION MANAGER FOR OVER TWENTY THREE YEARS AND I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL THREE NINETY NINE FOR OVER TWENTY. THIS ENVIRONMENT IS THEM LOW NEW TO ME BUT I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE BECAUSE I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE. OF THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. TO POINT NO AND I WANT TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR. PRODUCTION PEOPLE OTHER CRAFTS PEOPLE AND TECHNICIANS THAT WORK BEHIND THE SCENES TO MAKE WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN POSSIBLE. WE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU NEVER SEE OR HEAR ABOUT ON THE OSCARS AND EMMYS. THEY'RE CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF US LIVING AND WORKING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE THE ONES MOST DIRECTLY IMPACTED WHEN A FILM OR TV SERIES STAYS IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT LEAVES. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT AND EXPLAIN TO YOU EXACTLY WHAT I DO AS A LOCATION MANAGER AND SCOUT. THE JOB HAS TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. THE FIRST IS CREATIVE. COMPONENT IN THE SECOND OF LOGISTICAL. AND DURING THE CREATIVE PHASE OUR JOB IS TO FIND THE LOCATIONS THAT HELP FULFILL THE DIRECTOR'S VISION AND MOVE THE STORY FORWARD. THE SECOND PHASE IS PURELY LOGISTICAL OF MUCH LIKE THAT OF AN EVENT PLANNER. AND IF YOU WERE TO TREAT EACH LOCATION AS AN EVENT. CALIFORNIA. IT'S ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST LOCATIONS IN THE WORLD FOR FILMING. THE STATE OFFERS DIVERSE LOOKS INTO RAINS FROM MOUNTAINS OCEANS LAKES FOREST AND DESERT. WE ALSO HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE CREWS. HOWEVER MOST DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO SHOOT ARE DRIVEN BY WHERE YOU CAN PRODUCE THE FILM AT THE LOWEST COST. MATT'S MY OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES HAVE USED THE INCENTIVES. TO TAKE PRODUCTION AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA. AS A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO WHO WAS FORMERLY MARRIED TO A FIRST ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WHO CONSTANTLY WORKED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE ALL OF THE FILMS WERE BEING SHOT AND STATES AND COUNTRIES WITH SOME INCENTIVES. I STAYED AND WORKED IN TOWN IN ORDER TO RAISE MY CHILDREN. WHEN THE LOCAL WORK DRIED UP BEFORE THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED A BE EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE. AND KNOWING THAT LEAVING CALIFORNIA TO FOLLOW THE WORK WAS NOT AN OPTION FOR ME. I WORKED IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INDUSTRY FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE I COULD NOT SUPPORT MYSELF AND MY FAMILY FINANCIALLY AND THE LOCATION MANAGE. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WERE LEFT UNEMPLOYED. MANY HAD TO LEAVE THEIR FAMILIES AND TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME TO MAKE A LIVING. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. I DID A FEATURE CALLED STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. WHEN WE BEGAN PREPPING THE FILM THE PRODUCERS WERE COMPARING BUDGETS FOR ATLANTA AND NEW ORLEANS. IN ADDITION TO LOS ANGELES AND THANKS TO A. B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE WE WERE SELECTED TO RECEIVE THE TACTIC SENATE. AND WERE ABLE TO FOUND THE MOVING CALIFORNIA NOT CAN YOU IMAGINE A FILM CALLED STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON BEING FILMED IN NEW ORLEANS BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KEEP IT IN CALIFORNIA. WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF ITS RELEASE THAT FILM ABOUT A LOCAL CALIFORNIA HIP HOP GROUP HAD GROSSED OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORLD BY. AND THEN AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. IWORKED AS A SUPERVISING LOCATION MANAGER ON A WRINKLE IN TIME. IN ADDITION TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE ALSO FOUND IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY IN INYO COUNTY. AND IN FACT SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE FILM WAS SHOT THE REDWOODS AND HUMBOLDT. AGAIN I REMEMBER THE DAY THAT WE WERE INFORMED WE HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE CALIFORNIA TAX INCENTIVE. EVERYONE IN OUR OFFICE WAS CELEBRATED. THE PRODUCES ARE HAPPY THAT THEY COULD STAY HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THE REST OF US WERE HAPPY. THAT WE WOULD HAVE JOBS FOR THE NEXT NINE MONTHS AND JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND. I WOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY A LOCATION MANAGER IN ATLANTA BECAUSE THE PRODUCTION WAS PREPARED TO MOVE TO GEORGIA HAD WE NOT RECEIVED ANTHONY. I WOULD A LOST A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF MY ANNUAL INCOME. IF THE CALIFORNIA INCENTIVE PROGRAM DID NOT EXIST. AND TO ADD A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT WRINKLE. THE PROJECT EMPLOYED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WAS THE MOST INCLUSIVE. PROJECT I HAD WORKED ON IN MY ENTIRE CAREER THEIR PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN. AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY ALL PART OF THE SKILLED TECHNICIANS AND CRAFTS PEOPLE. EMPLOYED ON THAT BIG BUDGET FILM. AND I BUDGET IN OUR BUSINESS PRODUCTION DECISIONS AND THEY. WANTED TO YEARS IN ADVANCE AND CERTAINTY. IS NEEDED AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOR. THE JOB CREATOR THAT EXTENDS THE TWO POINT OH PROGRAM.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC AND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND LET ME FIRST START BY SAYING THAT I'VE BEEN A LONG TIME SUPPORTER. OF THIS FILM TAX CREDIT BEFORE I WAS ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE ARE ACTUALLY JOINT AND SPOKE AT RALLIES ON BEHALF OF MY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. WHICH UNTIL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT RECEIVED. THE MOST BUSINESS FROM THIS INDUSTRY. GIVEN THE VANTAGE POINTS INVESTORS THAT WE HAVE IN MY DISTRICT. THAT BEING SAID FOR THE BETTER PART OF ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH MANY DIVERSE MEMBERS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMITTEE HAVE COMMUNITY. OPTICALLY FROM THE API COMMUNITY WHO HAVE WISHED. THAT THE INDUSTRY COULD BE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF. WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES OF OF COLOR. AND EVERY TIME I GOT LA I GENERALLY END UP IN A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS NOT JUST PROVIDE ONE ANECDOTE TWO YEARS AGO THE NIGHT MY. SON WAS BORN MY SON IS CHINESE ARE THE OSCARS ARE HIGHLIGHTED. BROUGHT THREE. A YOUNG CHINESE KIDS UP TO THE STAGE AND PROCEEDED TO STEREOTYPE THEM AYE AND THAT WAS PART OF THE BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION OF THE OSCARS SO WHITE MOVEMENT. I ALSO WANNA JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND REFERENCE SOME OF THE. TESTIMONY IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BELOW THE LINE JOBS. MISMANAGED FROM THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION HAVE PROVIDED SOME STATISTICS ABOUT HOW. AFRICAN AMERICANS ONLY GOT FOUR PERCENT OF THE BELOW THE LINE JOBS CREATED DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF THE FILM TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM. ASIAN AMERICANS ONLY GOT TWO PERCENT OF THOSE JOBS NATIVE AMERICANS GOT ONE PERCENT WOMAN ONLY RECEIVED TWENTY NINE PERCENT LATINOS LANDED ELEVEN PERCENT. CLEARLY WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ARM AND I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I KNOW MISTER CALDERON HAS BEEN WORKING WITH. THE CHAIR OF THE API CAUCUS MISTER BONTA AND OTHERS AND. AND I'M SORRY I'M ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE INTO OTHER COMMITTEES AT THIS MOMENT BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU REFERENCED SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS YEAR'S TAX CREDIT. I I RAISE THIS BECAUSE I CONTINUE TO HEAR A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHAT MORE WE CAN DO. AND. I HAVE REALLY QUESTION BUT I ALSO WANT TO JUST MAKE THE COMMENT THAT I THINK THERE IS MUCH MORE WE SHOULD DO. ARE MY HOPE IS THIS DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE AND. I KNOW THAT I'M WORKING WITH MISTER BARTON OTHERS TO CONTINUE TO SOLICIT GOOD IDEAS THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY PROPOSED TO THE AUTHOR. TO ADDRESS THIS. TO ADDRESS NOT JUST THE BELOW THE LINE DYNAMIC BUT YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THIS TAX CREDIT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT. BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPACT ABOUT THE LINE AND. AND WHILE THIS IS A TAX CREDIT FOCUSED IN ONE PART OF THE SECTOR. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY OUR WAY TO ENSURE THAT HOPEFULLY THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION SO AM I WANT TO SAY THAT I WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TO MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY BUT I AM GOING TO RESERVE MY VOTE. FOR THE FLOOR IN HOPES THAT THE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION I HAD THE SAME COMMENTS FOR MISTER NEWS AARON'S BILL BUT I ALSO WANT AND JUST ASK YOU AUTHOR AND ANYONE ELSE WHO IS HERE. WHAT OTHER IDEAS HAVE THEIR BAND TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD BELOW THE LINE AND WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE CAN IMPACT? AT THE DIVERSITY CHALLENGES THAT WE CERTAINLY SEE ABOVE THE LINE SO THANK YOU AFTER YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL OUT WE HAD A REALLY BIG MEETING BETWEEN. THE JOINT AUTHORS OF THE BILL'S WALLS THE ENTIRE COALITION TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND DIVERSITY AND I AM YOU MISTER BONTA ATTENDED THE MEETING MISTER BONTA EARLY ON. HAD ASKED TO BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS ARE SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO DIVERSITY IN ALL OBVIOUS WE WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE HIM THERE TO BE A PART OF THIS. PROBLEM SOLVING GROUP THAT WERE PART OF RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM THAT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED. AROUND ADVERSITY HAS BEEN MORE CENTERED AROUND THE INABILITY FOR UP FOR. DOT LOOK THEY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES EVERS COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO KIND HAVE THIS. PATHWAY INTO THE. INTO THE INDUSTRY AYE AND SO WE CREATED THIS CAREER PATHWAYS TRAINING PROGRAM. TO GO DIRECTLY AFTER A LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES A TO GO AFTER A HOT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO NOT CREATE AN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM BUT TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO BE FUNDED BY THOSE THAT ARE BEING. CAN BE RECIPIENTS OF THE FILM TAX CREDIT THAT ARE BENEFITING. UP FROM STATE INCENTIVIZE DE STATE INCENTIVES OB CONTRIBUTORS PROGRAM TO GET THEM JOB TRAINING ARE AND THAT'S REALLY KIND OF BEEN THE PROBLEM OUT WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING MORE. DAD DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AT IN ENGAGED IN THIS NSR THAT IN THE SECTOR SO WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE CAREER PATHWAYS TRAINING PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL ALLOW US TO. TO BRING MORE DIVERSITY INTO THE INDUSTRY AYE IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT EVERY. FACET OF THIS INDUSTRY FROM THE STUDIOS TO TO ALL OF THE LABOR UNIONS ARE BELOW THE LINE WORKERS ARE GOING TO BEING GAY ASIAN. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A COUPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE LINE UP THERE ARE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN THE WEATHER'S PROP TWO ON NINE ISSUES INCENTIVIZE OKAY WE WANT TO BE OF THAT SENT VICE IF YOU HIRE WOMAN TO BE A DIRECTOR OF THE PROJECT. WELL WHAT DOES THAT DO IN TERMS OF PROP TWO ONE NINE IN AND SPECIFICALLY OF MANAGING ONE GROUP OVER THE OTHER. AYE AND SO NOW WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. WE HAVE ALWAYS STAYED OPEN AND WILL COMMIT A WAS CONTINUE TO STAY OPEN TO NEW IDEAS. BUT I I I I WELCOME HELP I WAS WITH YOU. WHEN YOU WERE SUPERVISOR WHEN WE WERE WHEN WE WERE UP IN THAT FILM NOR CAL ARE MAKING THE THE YOU HAD THE PITCH TO TO GET EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE PASS AND SO I APPRECIATED YOUR SUPPORT BACK THEN I DO APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT NOW. ARE AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP SO IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO PRESENT THOSE IDEAS TO THE COALITION TO TRYING TO AS MUCH SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE. BUT AGAIN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER. ALRIGHT THANK YOU IF IF I COULD JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE PANEL ON THIS TOPIC. WE HAVE IT WE HAVE A PROGRAM WITH SOLANO COUNTY WORKFORCE BOARD. AND IT'S FOR THAT AT RISK YOUTH THAT ARE IN DANGER OF NOT GRADUATING. SO WE BRING A MAN WE GIVEN TRAINING DALIAN. GRIPPING LIGHTING BUT ALSO ON STAGE MANAGEMENT. SO I'M I'M A LITTLE GUY SO I I CAN ONLY HIRE COUPLE GUYS AT A TIME BUT IT'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. IN THE CITY OF VALLEJO AND BAD AREAS. IT'S ALL. REALLY DIVERSE SO MOST OF THE. IT'S COMING UP PROGRAM. ARTS OR SOME THE GROUP THAT SHOULD MENTION. IT GETS IN THE AND JUST BE CLEAR TO YOU ON THE CAREER PATHWAYS THAT I'D ACTUALLY HAS GONE THAT I AYE SIDETRACK MYSELF. IS. THAT DID THIS ISN'T AN INTERNSHIP IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE PAID TO DO I AND YOU'RE GONNA BE BEING TRAINED AS I CAN IMPRESS AS AN APPRENTICESHIP. BEING TRAINED BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THE BEST IN THE IN THE BUSINESS. SO REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER I THE FAST OF THE INITIAL YOU CHOOSE TO GO AND YOU CAN BE BEING TRAINED BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE THAT ARE. THE BEST AT WHAT THEY DO TO GET THAT EXPERIENCE OUGHT TO THEN BE SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO THE INDUSTRY. IF I COULD JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THAT SIR VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THE AUTHORS. UNDERSTANDING APPRECIATION OF THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE ENGAGE WITH YOU AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS. I DO THINK. THAT WHILE. ENSURING THERE'S A BIG ENOUGH PATHWAY IS ONE ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM AND FOCUSING ON. ON ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND SO CALLED AT RISK COMMUNITIES IMPORTANT. I HAVE HEARD. AT LENGTH FROM MANY MEMBERS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY WHO MAY NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES SO CALLED AT RISK CURVE LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS WHO REPRESENT. DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WHO'VE BEEN WORKING AND TOILING IN THE INDUSTRY WHO CANNOT SEEM TO BREAK INTO. THE BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHETHER BECAUSE OF NETWORKS THAT ARE CLOSE TO THEM OR SOMEHOW PERCEPTION THAT AMERICAN THE WORLD MAY NOT WANT TO SEE CERTAIN TYPES OF FILMS. ARE AND CERTAIN TYPES OF STORIES IN THIS IS A THIS IS A VERY COMMON AND NO DISCUSSION THAT'S HAPPENING AND HAS BEEN HAPPENING THE LAST COUPLE YEARS BUT MY HOPE IS THAT. IN ADDITION TO PATHWAYS WE CAN THINK ABOUT OTHER WAYS OF OF EXPANDING ACCESS. AS A FORMER CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY I'M CERTAINLY AWARE. OF THE CHALLENGES YOU MENTION AROUND PROP TO A NINE AND AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BUT. I AM I CONTINUE TO HAVE SO MANY CONVERSATIONS AND REALLY EVERY TIME I GO DOWN LA AND MEET WITH. DIVERSE MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY IT'S JUST WHAT I CONTINUE TO HEAR AND THERE IS A ONGOING PERCEPTION THAT THIS TAX CREDIT IS NOT GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE WITH REGARD TO THAT AND I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SO. LOOK FOR TO THE CONVERSATION AND AGAIN THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR WORK AND AND AND GOOD THOUGHTS ON THIS TOPIC THEY GIVE SOME IMMATURE AND AM IN AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION I MEAN THE PROGRAM IS RELATIVELY NEW. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THE DEFICIENCIES WHEN IT SO ISSUES OF LIKE DIVERSITY AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE HAVING A VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION ON THIS ARE. WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND AND THAT IS NOT FALLING ON DEAF EARS. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHAUNA MEMBER FREEMAN. IF I. APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I SPENT. OVER TWENTY YEARS MY ENTIRE CAREER IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. WORKING AS A PRODUCER AND A DEVELOPMENT EXECUTIVE I'VE ALWAYS WORKED ABOUT THE LINE I'VE NEVER WORKED BELOW THE LINE. AND I LOOK AT THE. DIVERSITY ISSUES ACTUALLY FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LANCE COMING FROM THE EXECUTIVE RANKS. AND I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES WITH THE WORK FORCE PIVOTAL LINER I BELIEVE ACTUALLY MUCH EASIER SOLVE THAT ABOVE THE LINE. AND YOU KNOW I COULD TALK FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT WHAT THAT'S. NO MY FEELINGS ABOUT THAT IN MY PERSPECTIVES ON IT BUT IT'S NOT REALLY RELEVANT TO A YOU KNOW THAT PART TO THIS BILL I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN SOLVE ANY OF THAT THROUGH THIS KIND OF A VEHICLE AND I WOULDN'T EXPECTED TO. I CAN TELL YOU THOUGH IT COMING FROM A DISTRICT THAT HAS A WITHIN IT FOR MAJOR FILM STUDIOS. AND WHERE A PART OF ME VAST MAJORITY OF RESIDENTS WORK EITHER DIRECTLY IN THE INDUSTRY OR IN SOME ANCILLARY ROLE I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE. PREVIOUS INCARNATION OF THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF YOU KNOW A MONUMENTAL CHANGE FROM WHAT WE HAD SEEN BEFORE. AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY WHO ARE NOW WORKING SUBTLY IN LOS ANGELES WHO WERE EITHER TRAVELING OR. AS YOU SAID DENIED THE ABILITY TO WORK AT ALL BECAUSE OF CREWS YOU KNOW A LOT OF CREWS BEING ABLE TO BE HIRED NOW IN A LOT OF THE COMMON LOCATIONS. I'M HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES IN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. NAM MOVE THEIR CAREERS FORWARD I'M AFFORD TO LIVE IN WHAT'S INCREASINGLY A HOT YOU KNOW VERY DIFFICULT. A CITY TO PAY FOR RENT AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS IT TAKES TO LIVE IN LOS ANGELES I'M THIS IS BEEN A REAL LIFE LINE. TO THE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW THAT THE FILM INDUSTRY IS IS DIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES BESIDES BEING. YOU KNOW A HUGE INDUSTRY AROUND LOS ANGELES IT'S ALSO OUR SIGNATURE INDUSTRY IT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY THINK OF CALIFORNIA WHEN I THINK OF LOS ANGELES. IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING TOURISM THE IMAGE OF OUR STATE ARM THE DREAMS OF OUR CHILDREN I CAME TO LOS ANGELES IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO BECAUSE I GOT A JOB AT A FILM STUDIO.

SO THAT I UNDERSTAND NOT TO PREPARED TO DO THAT THIS MORNING BUT I THINK THAT. THESE ARE BILLS THAT SHOULD BE RECONCILED WITH ONE ANOTHER. OF THEY'RE BOTH IMPORTANT EFFORTS AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. OKAY. I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY ARE PRETTY ENTHUSIASTICALLY I WOULD HUMBLY REQUEST TO BE ADDED AS AN AUTHORED SOME POINT IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN THE INDUSTRY AS SOME OF YOU KNOW MY FATHER WAS. YOU'RE KIND OF A GROUNDBREAKING GUY IN LATINO CHARACTER ACTING OF YOU KNOW BASICALLY FROM THE FORTIES ON. AND YOU KNOW IT TO SEE THE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW GETS A BIFURCATED THE WAY IT HAS OVER THE YEARS AND MOVE ALL OVER THE US ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I'VE WATCHED AS FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS STRUGGLE TO HAVE THEIR FAMILIES HERE AND THEIR FRIEND EXCUSE ME THEIR JOBS. IN ATLANTA OR WERE AT WHEREVER. ATLANTA TORONTO ON MY WIFE'S COUSIN IS BEEN IN CANADA PROBABLY MORE THAT SHE'S BEEN IN THE IN THE U. S.. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT CAMILLE BUT FRUSTRATING SO I PLOP PLOP THIS EFFORT.

WELL HE WAS AN ITALIAN ANY WASN'T MEXICAN IN THE IN THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN AND I'M I'M ONLY I'M ONLY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE KIDDING HERE BUT. WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE GET QUALITY TALENT. AND WHAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE ARE GOOD QUALITY PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THIS INDUSTRY BUT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY. AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID AND WE HAD A MEETING IN LOS ANGELES WITH ABOUT. TWELVE. LEGISLATORS MANY OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE. A ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE WOMEN. ABOVE THE LINE. OTHER MINORITIES MONTH ON THE LINE ABOVE THE LINE AT BUT ALSO BELOW THE LINE JOBS AND IS ANYBODY THAT CAN TELL YOU WHEN YOU HEARD IT TODAY VERY SUCCINCTLY. LOCATION SCOUTS TALENT SCOUTS MAKE UP WHEN I WENT ON OF US THAT. AND I I HAVE A LITTLE CO STARRING ROLE OR I WAS THE LEAD IN THE COMMERCIAL I TURNED AROUND IN THIS THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE BEHIND ME. AND THOSE ARE THE THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INLAND EMPIRE IT SECTOR THAT ARE WORKING DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THE TOP BILLED ACTORS THEY'RE FINE PRODUCERS DIRECTORS THEY'RE FINE THIS ISN'T ABOUT THEM SO MUCH. IT'S ABOUT THOSE FOLKS THAT MADE THEIR CAREER AND STATE THEIR LIVES HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

I I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR FOR THE RECORD THAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT EVERYONE HERE AND EVERYONE HERE NEEDS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. AND I AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR ABOUT MY COLLEAGUE OF SAN FRANCISCO BRING UP VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. BECAUSE THOSE ISSUES ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THATWILL NET THIS INDUSTRY TOGETHER AND IT WILL NEED IT IN THE FUTURE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO THE REST THE STATE. BECAUSE OUR STATE IS SO DIVERSE BUT LET'S GET THE JOBS LET'S KEEP THE JOBS HERE. AND THEN WE CAN YOU KNOW MASSAGE THE DIFFERENCES ARE I'M SURE THESE BILLS WILL BE RECONCILED AS WE GO FORWARD. I DID HAVE A QUICK QUESTION. AND IT'S PROBABLY JUST A AYOU KNOW YES FROM YOU PROBABLY BUT IT LOOKS TO ME I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE BECAUSE THEY MET WITH A CAME TO MY OFFICE AND IT WITH ME AND THAT'S THE. THE. MUSICIANS GLAD TO SEE THAT'S IN THE BILL. MOVIE STUDIOS RANCHES WERE NOT WERE PRETTY ALL INCLUSIVE IN THIS BILL THAT'S CORRECT YES IT IS TO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT ON THE RECORD. THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR BEING ADDED AS AN AUTHOR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE OTHER THE OTHER BILL. BIG UP BIG TIME IN SUPPORT OF THIS OF THIS LEGISLATION TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT IT WAS CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CLASSROOM. SINCE I'M THE ONLY ONE ON THE PANEL NOW NOT SPEAKING I I I WANTED TO AT LEAST. SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK I APPRECIATE THAT THEIR SUCH A VIBRANT INTEREST. AND IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS NOT ONLY PRESERVED BUT ALSO THRIVES BECAUSE WE HAVE LOST QUITE A BIT OF JOBS AND. THE DISPLACEMENT OF FAMILIES A HAS IMPACTED ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN DISTRICTS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN OTHERS UMP EVERY WHEN I WAS CAMPAIGNING IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE EVERY OTHER DOOR I'D KNOCK ON. A SPECIAL IN STUDIO CITY IT'S EITHER ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OR REALTORS. AND THE AND THE THEY KNOW WHERE TO BUY. AND AND THE BUT WHAT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE WAS. I EVERY TIME IT WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT HOME OF ONE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WOULD. A NOT BE HOME AND THEY WERE GONNA THEY WERE AWAY FOR EITHER A STRETCH OF A THREE MONTH TO SIX MONTH. PERIOD A SOMEWHERE IN THE EAST COAST AND OR OR SOUTHEAST. SO. THAT THIS IS SOMETHING PERSONALLY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT SO A AND IT'S I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT MEMBERS ACTUALLY CARING ENOUGH ABOUT THIS. TO ONE OF PUSH THIS FORWARD AND WITH THE MULTIPLE CO AUTHORS AND THE VARIOUS INTERESTS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL BECAUSE. THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT THAT COMES BACK GOES INTO THE GENERAL FUNDS. WHICH ALSO ENHANCES OTHER PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO. EDUCATION SO. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT DETRACT FROM THESE EFFORTS BUT NOT HELP CONTINUE. BUILDING IT. BECAUSE SAID THE NEW NORM IS GONNA BE THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER STATES AFTER THE DUST SETTLES. THERE ARE GONNA BE SEVERAL STATES THAT WERE NOT A KEY PLAYER IN THIS INDUSTRY BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOW ARE. AND THAT'S PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INACTION. OF THIS BODY FROM. TWENTY YEARS AGO. SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS MOVEMENT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE EVERYONE INVOLVED. BUT YOU SUMMIT MEMBER. VICTOR MATURE MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT FROM THE MEMBERS. ON BEING THE ALLOWED. I DID HOWEVER THING HAS BEEN SET. BUT THE UP ON I THINK YOU VERY MUCH OF FORMER CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS OVER IN MANY OF YOUR. OF PRINCE VOCAL AUTHORS. BOB.

KANSEN CHU RGHT KANSEN CHU AYE WALDRON WALDRON AYE ACOSTA BY A CONSTANT ON ME DAVID CHIU BY. DAVID CHIU AYE FRIEDMAN. MEDINA. NAZARIAN BY. MS ARYAN I. DO YOU PASS CLINTON COVER MUCH OF NO POTS WILL HOLD IT OPEN FOR THE APPS AND. A MEMBERS. THANK YOU MEMBER MUCH. MEMBER CHOL HERE. NO. MEMBERS GLORIA. YOUR OWN SOON. OUR I MEMBERS GLORIA YOUR OWN WITH GRAVY TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX SIR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I BRING BEFORE YOU TODAY A BILL THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AS THE LEGISLATURE'S ONLY ENROLLED TRIBAL MEMBER. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX SEEKS TO FINALLY PUT AN END TO A DECADES OLD CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DISPOSITION OF NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY HELD AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES. AS YOUR STAFF AXLE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX REQUIRE THE UC REGENTS TO ESTABLISH AND SUPPORT A SYSTEM WIDE COMMITTEE. AND THE CAMPUS SPECIFIC IN A CAMPUS SPECIFIC COMMITTEES TO ESTABLISH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF NATIVE AMERICAN HUMAN REMAINS AND CULTURAL ITEMS IN THE POSSESSION OF YOU SEE CAMPUSES. AND MUSEUMS. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX COMES AFTER DECADES OF LEGISLATION OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND THREATS OF LITIGATION FROM NUMEROUS SOVEREIGN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. FOLLOWING THE NACHMAN OF THE FEDERAL NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT IN NINETEEN NINETY. THIS LEGISLATURE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED A BEAT NINE SEVENTY EIGHT BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALE STEINBERG TO ENSURE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW FEDERAL LAW. REGRETTABLY SEVERAL UC CAMPUSES HAVE NOT ONLY FAILED TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW AS INTENDED. BUT SEVERAL OF OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS REPORT THE UC SYSTEM HAS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INVOLVE TRAVEL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE IMPORTANT PROCESS HE'S. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE SENATE GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE HELD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING TO EXAMINE THIS ISSUE. AND WHILE MOST OF US WERE NOT IN THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME ACCORDING TO THE TRANSCRIPT IT IS CLEAR THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WERE FRUSTRATED BY THE UC'S LACK OF PROGRESS. AND REPATRIATING BEATS HUMAN REMAINS AND OTHER IMPORTANT ARTIFACTS. HEARING RESULTED IN SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON PAGE ELEVEN OF YOUR ANALYSIS. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE CAMPUS LEVEL COLLABORATION WITH TRIBES AND CAMPUS LEVEL CLASS OF COMPLIANCE COMMITTEES. WHICH ARE COOPERATED INTO THIS BILL BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MANY OF THESE REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS ARE HOUSED IN STORAGE UNITS AND OTHER FACILITIES THAT DO NOT RESPECT THE SACRED NATURE OF THESE ITEMS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW NATIVE AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THEIR ANCESTORS CANNOT REST IN THE TO TELL THE REMAINS ARE PROPERLY CARED FOR MAKING THIS BILL DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ALL INVOLVED. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS MORNING FOR AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX TO HOPEFULLY ONCE AND FOR ALL CONCLUDE A CONVERSATION THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S BEEN HAVING WITH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES. I'VE ASKED TO MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UC. TO HEAR SOME OF THEIR FOR THE FROM BE TO HEAR THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND TO TOUR SOME OF THEIR FACILITIES WHERE THESE ARTIFACTS AND REMAINS ARE BEING HELD. MY WE HAVE NOT HEARD BACK ON THAT REQUEST MY INTENTION IS TO FIND COMMON GROUND IF POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO REAP REPATRIATE. THESE ARTIFACTS REMAINS. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS MORNING WITH APPRECIATION FOR THIS COMMITTEES VALUABLE TIME WITH ME TODAY I HAVE BY REMISE OUT ZAMORA. MYERS A PECHANGA MEMBER AND A CAL GRAD WHO IS AN INTERNET THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM WHILE AT CAO. AND SHE'S CURRENTLY PART OF THE CHILD THE TRIBAL CULTURAL DEPARTMENT AND IS IT'S EXPERT IN TRIBAL HISTORY AND CULTURE. SEE ALSO JOINED TODAY BY POLITY THEIR REPRESENTATIVE AND THE AUDIENCE HAVE JACOB HERE WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TOSS IN THE TRIBAL ALLIANCE OF SOVEREIGN INDIAN NATIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. MUSEUM. HELLO EVERYONE GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS MEYER MONTHS SALES AMORA AND I EARNED A BA IN ANTHROPOLOGY FROM UC BERKELEY. AND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IRON MY MASTER'S DEGREE IN ANTHROPOLOGY WITH THE FOCUS IN ARCHAEOLOGY FROM SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. AND BECAME A REGISTERED ARCHAEOLOGISTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE PECHANGA BAND OF THE SEND YOU INDIANS Y. SERVICE THE TRIBAL ARCHAEOLOGIST AND CURATOR. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN RETURNING OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDPARENTS AND THEIR FUNERARY ITEMS HOME. TO WHERE THEY BELONG SO WE CAN GIVE THEM A PROPER BURIAL WITH THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY. THAT THEY AND ALL OTHER PEOPLE DESERVES. ALMOST THIRTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE FEDERAL NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT NAGRA. THAT REQUIRES FEDERALLY FUNDED MUSEUMS AND UNIVERSITIES TO REPATRIATE HUMAN REMAINS AND IS SO SHE DID. AN UNASSOCIATED FUNERARY OBJECTS TO FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES. SINCE ITS PASSAGE MANY FEDERAL AGENCIES AND MUSEUMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE REPATRIATED. NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS AND THEIR POSSESSIONS BUT THERE IS STILL MORE WORK TO BE DONE. TO SAFELY RETURN ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS AND THEIR BELONGINGS HEARING CALIFORNIA. IN OUR HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA CURRENT LAW HAS PROVEN TO BE AN ADEQUATE. AND INEFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. MY ANCESTORS ARE STILL SEEN AS SPECIMENS TO MANY RESEARCHERS INSTEAD OF HUMAN BEINGS. WHAT THE RIGHT TO A FINAL RESTING PLACE? IN FACT AS OF JUNE TO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. UC BERKELEY HAD REPATRIATED ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN. OF ITS TEN THOUSAND REMAINS. THE UNIVERSITY HAS FOUND WAYS UNDER THE CURRENT NAG PRO LAW TO STALL THE REPATRIATION PROCESS AND IN MANY CASES. OUTRIGHT DENIED CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR REPATRIATION. THE DENIAL OF THE RETURN OF MY GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDMOTHER AND THOSE OF OTHER CALIFORNIA TRIBES. HUGHES HUMAN BONES WERE DUG UP IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE IT'S OUTRAGEOUS ANY MORAL. AND FRANKLY A VIOLATION. OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT ONLY A PERSONAL MATTER FOR ME AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MY ANCESTORS HUMAN REMAINS. BUT I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE IN TURN AT THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY ON THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS. AND TWO THOUSAND THREE I WAS AN INTERN IN THE KNACK FOR DIVISION AT PHOEBE HEARST ASSISTING WITH NAG PRO REPATRIATIONS. FOR CALIFORNIA TRIBES. I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING INVENTORY FOR NAGRA COLLECTIONS. AND DURING CONSULTATION IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. WITH A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TRIBE. THE PHOEBE HEARST NAG PER DIRECTOR AT THE TIME BROUGHT OUT A CARD OF A SO SHE DID FUNERARY OBJECTS. THAT THE TRIBE WAS REQUESTING TO REPATRIATE. DURING THE CONSULTATION. TRIBAL ELDERS TOLD THE NAGRA DIRECTOR THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THEIR CURRENT REPATRIATION CLAIM. BUT THE DIRECTOR DENIED THAT ANY ADDITIONAL ITEMS WERE IN THE MUSEUM'S POSSESSION. BECAUSE I HAD CHECKED THE INVENTORIES OF ALL THAT PER ITEMS. I NEW PERSONALLY THAT THEY WERE ADDITIONAL FUNERARY OBJECTS FOR THE MUSEUM WAS FAILING TO DENY. AS THEY LOOKED AT THESE ELDERS SITTING AROUND THE TABLE SEEING THEIR SAD FACES AND TEARS ROLLED DOWN HER CHEEKS. I WAS DISGUSTED. YOU KNOW AS WELL AS ME. THAT THIS IS NOT A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE. THIS BILL WILL COMPEL INSTITUTIONS TO TAKE CONSULTATION AND OUTREACH TO TRIBES MORE SERIOUSLY. IN ORDER TO RETURN HUMAN REMAINS. AND THOSE PEOPLE'S PERSONAL POSSESSIONS OFF THE MUSEUM SHELVES AND DRAWERS AND RETURN THEM HOME TO THE APPROPRIATE TRIBE FOR PROPER CARE. IT MANDATES A TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR THE RETURN OF OUR ANCESTORS AND THE ITEMS THEY WERE BURIED WITH. THE BILL REQUIRES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE UC SYSTEM. TO HELP ENSURE THAT REPATRIATION CLAIMS. OUR PROCESS FAIRLY AND TIMELY. THE BILL CREATES A CHECKS AND BALANCE SYSTEM BY REQUIRING THAT NAG PROPOSE SEES. AND THEIR PROCEDURES INCLUDE TRIBAL VOICE. BOTH IN THE CREATION OF THEM AND IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. FURTHER ACCOUNTABILITY. IS REQUIRED THROUGH AN AUDIT EVERY TWO YEARS FOR NAG PRO COMPLIANCE IN THE UC SYSTEM. IN RECENT DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT PROGRESS TREATING INDIAN TRIBES WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. WHAT IS HAPPENING UNDER NAGRA IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE HEARD EXPRESSED AT MEMORIALIZED? IN OTHER STATE POLICIES. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX. ON BEHALF OF THOUSANDS OF NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR FINAL RESTING PLACE. IN MANY CASES DUG UP OVER A CENTURY AGO AND SUBJECT TO DESECRATION. IN CLOSING. I SPEAK TO ALL THE NATIVE AMERICAN HUMAN BONES AND SPIRITS. BETTER STILL IN THE MUSEUM HOLDINGS THAT WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU. AND WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR YOUR RETURN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PAULA. MISTER CHAIR. AND VICE CHAIR UPPALA TREAT ON BEHALF OF THE JUNGLE BAND LOOSING YOU INDIANS AND THE. COLUSA INDIAN COMMUNITY OUT ONE THINKING OF THE AUTHOR VERY MUCH IN THE CO AUTHORS FOR FOR BRINGING THIS I WAS HERE TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THIS CAME UP IN HEARING I WAS HERE TEN YEARS AGO WHEN THIS CAME UP IN HEARINGS. AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT I'M A CAL GRAD AND AS YOU HEARD FROM MYRA THAT'S THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN REMAINS OUT OF TEN THOUSAND. HAVE BEEN REPATRIATED. SO THIS HAS TO STOP I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO IT ABOVE AND BEYOND THIS BILL MAYBE YOU EVEN LOOK AT THEIR BUDGETS BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S A A VERY UPSETTING TO ME IT SHOULD BE FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS ENTIRE BODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYA ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. OF AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX. PLEASE COME FORWARD STATE YOUR NAME. AND YOUR AFFILIATION.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SUCH A SUMMER FIAT BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THIS TIME. HOWEVER WE DID WANT TO COME FORWARD TODAY AND AND TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND. VIEWPOINT FROM REVERSE EFFECT TO ON OUR PRIOR ART PREVIOUSLY TO THIS BILL ONE OF LET THE MEMBER KNOW WE WILL BE BACK IN TOUCH WITH YOU VERY SHORTLY. TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR REQUEST TO MEET AND PERHAPS A PRODUCTIVE IS LOOKING FOR IS A CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO SAY. GENERALLY THAT IT IS SOME. MY VIEW THE UNIVERSITY HAS. SOUGHT TO TAKE A VERY. DIGNIFIED AND RESPECTFUL. APPROACH WITH RESPECT TO ALL THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES I'VE A COLLEAGUE WITH BEING A MEDICINA MOM TO COULD SPEAK TO MORE THE DETAILS. BUT ONE DOES THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WE WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE'VE ACTED IN GOOD FAITH. WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSES THAT WE MUST FOLLOW UNDERSTAND FEDERAL LAW. AND THAT. WE'RE CONTINUE TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY THROUGH THOSE THOSE IMPORTANT PROCESS THESE. BEFORE I TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE IS ONE MOMENT LIKE TO SAY THAT. WE THINK THAT THERE MAY BE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS RESULT THIS BILL ONE BILL TALK THROUGH THOSE LOVE IT WITH YOU AND AND THE AUTHOR. I AND ALSO JUST AS WELL NOTE THAT THEM WE WANT ALSO EXPLORE SOME OF THE POTENTIAL. ISSUES THAT MAY COME UP THE GUARD TO UNIVERSITIES CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMY WITH RESPECT TO THIS ISSUE AS WELL SO. WITHOUT A LIKE TO HAND OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE A ONE STRIKE FLINTRIDGE RESOURCE. MORNING. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR RESEARCH POLICY AT THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. IN THAT CAPACITY WE WE ARE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIVERSITY'S RESEARCH POLICIES INCLUDING THE ONES RELATED TO THAT PRO. WE CONVENE THE SYSTEM WIDE NET FOR ADVISORY GROUP WE PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO CAMPUSES AND WE INVITE WE REVISE POLICIES AT AS NECESSARY. ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS RETIRED LAST YEAR AND HE HAD THE DEEP EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA. I'M COMING UP TO SPEED AS QUICKLY AS I CAN. ABA WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF CONVENING ARE ADVISORY GROUP RIGHT NOW. WE ARE GOING TO BE REVIEWING OUR EXISTING POLICY WHICH I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALREADY NEED SOME REVISION. SO. AS WITH OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH RELATED POLICY I'M COMMITTED TO ENSURING A THOUGHTFUL AND BALANCED APPROACH IS TAKEN FOR THESE EFFORTS. ALL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS FULLY COMMITTED TO THE REPATRIATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN HUMAN REMAINS AND ASSOCIATED OBJECTS. AT AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. OUR MISSION OF COURSES TEACHING RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICE WE AIM TO SERVE SOCIETY IS THE CENTER OF HIGHER LEARNING PROVIDE LONG TERM SOCIETAL BENEFITS TO TRANSMIT ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERING NEW KNOWLEDGE AND FUNCTIONING AS AN ACTIVE WORKING REPOSITORY. OF ORGANIZE KNOWLEDGE. SIX OF OUR CAMPUSES HOUSE RESEARCH COLLECTIONS THAT INCLUDE NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL OBJECTS IN REMAINS. THE UNIVERSITY FULLY ACKNOWLEDGES THE DIFFICULT AND FRAUGHT CONTEXT IN WHICH MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS OBJECTS WERE MOVED FROM THEIR BURIAL LOCATIONS ARE COMMUNITIES PRIOR TO. THE CURRENT CULTURAL RESOURCES PROTECTIONS AND OFTEN WITHOUT CONSENT FROM THE DESCENDANT COMMUNITIES. UP FEDERAL MAG PARA WAS ENACTED SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK BACKGROUND FEDERAL MAG PER WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY TO SHELVE THE SYSTEMATIC PROCESS FOR DETERMINING RIGHTS OF LINEAL DESCENDANTS. TO CERTAIN HUMAN REIGNS AND AND ASSOCIATED OBJECTS WITH WHICH THEY'RE AFFILIATED IT'S A HIGHLY COMPLEX LAW AIMED AT ESTABLISHING REPATRIATION RIGHTS FOR TRIBES. AND WAS NEGOTIATED THE BALANCE BETWEEN NATIVE AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC AND MUSEUM COMMUNITIES. FOR YOU SEE THE STUDY AND PRESERVATION OF CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORIES LANGUAGES AND MATERIAL CULTURE HAVE LONG BEEN SOURCES OF DEEP INTEREST. OR UNIVERSITY ANTHROPOLOGIST HISTORIC AND HISTORIANS AND LINGUISTS. HUMAN REMAINS AND ASSOCIATED MATERIALS HAVE COME TO OUR CAMPUSES FROM OF ROT WIDE VARIETY OF MEANS INCLUDING UNINTENTIONAL DISCOVERIES. TRANSFERS FROM COUNTY CORONER OFFICE AT CORNERS OFFICES. AND EVEN DONATIONS TO HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE BROADER STORY OF HUMANITY SUCH AS HOW TO BECOME TO OCCUPY THE PLANET AND MIGRATE THE WORLD. EXISTING CALIFORNIA POLICY POLICY AND PROCEDURES ON CURATION REPATRIATION OF HUMAN REMAINS AND CULTURAL ITEMS IS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE LATIN LAST SUBSTANCE WE REVISED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE. TO REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH NIAGARA INCLUDING RICK REQUIRING REPATRIATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN RATE REMAINS AN ASSOCIATE OF OBJECTS. WE FIND THAT MUCH OF AB TWENTY THIRTY SIX IS REDUNDANT WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S CURRENT POLICY AND PRACTICES. AS SUCH WE BELIEVE IT'S IT'S UNNECESSARY OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE ADDING A LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY. THAT MAY LIMIT THE RANGE OF EXPERTISE THE UNIVERSITY CAN DRAWN IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION COMPLIANCE EFFORTS COMPLICATE THE INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS. AND THEREBY HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF ACTUALLY DELAYING RESPONSES TO REPATRIATION REQUESTS. THE RIGID ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR VARIABILITY IN CAMPUS COLLECTIONS OR BETWEEN AND AMONG NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. MOREOVER FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IT SEEMS AT THIS MAY BE DRIVEN. BY VERY OUTDATED PERCEPTION ABOUT A PARTICULAR INCIDENT EVEN AT THE TIME THE CAMPUS INVOLVED FELT THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT MISS CHARACTERIZATIONS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE. THAT OUR CAMPUSES ARE CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO IMPROVE THEIR PROCESSES TO IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE UC DAVIS LAST YEAR REINVENTED AND REINVIGORATED AND DIVERSE SYFY THEIR LOCAL CAMPUS COMMITTEE. THEY CONSULTED WITH TRIBES IN THE CREATION OF A NEW POLICIES THAT'S NOW IN EFFECT. A SIMILARLY AFTER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REVIEW BERKELEY IS MAKING MAJOR CHANGES TO ITS COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND AND. THE TERMS OF ITS MEMBERS. UNDER THE UC POLICY MOST OF THE DAY IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES. SKY SIR I'M GETTING INTO THE POLICY ITSELF A LITTLE BIT NOT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THE POLICY DOES TO. MOST OF THE DAY TO DAY IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES OCCUR AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL BUT THE POLICY ALSO REQUIRES SYSTEM WIDE LEVEL REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF CAMPUS IS PROPOSED CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS AND REPATRIATIONS. AND ESTABLISHES A SYSTEM WIDE ADVISORY GROUP TO REVIEW AND ADVISE THE PRESIDENT ON THESE MATTERS. THE POLICY REQUIRES CAMPUSES TO PREPARE INVENTORIES AND SUMMARIES OF THEIR COLLECTION IN CONSULTATION WITH THE TRIBES WHICH THEY HAVE DONE. I WANTED TO SHARE A COUPLE NUMBERS WITH YOU. IN A RECENT CHECK WE'VE. PUBLISHED ON SIX THOUSAND EIGHT AMERICAN HUMAN REMAINS AND OVER TO WORK TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ASSOCIATED FUNERAL OBJECTS SYSTEM WIDE. MANY OF THESE REMAINS HAVE BEEN CLAIMED AND TRANSFER TO MAKE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES FOR BURIAL BUT THE MAJORITY HAVE NOT YET BEEN CLAIMED. ARE AND CONTINUE TO BE HOUSE UC CAMPUSES UNTIL SUCH REQUESTS FOR REPATRIATION ARE MADE. FOR EXAMPLE UC BERKELEY A FULL EIGHTY TWO PERCENT OF THE HUMAN REMAINS PUBLISHED AS CULTURALLY AFFILIATED REMAIN THE HEARST MUSEUMS CARE TO BE TRANSFERRED AT THE AFFILIATE THE TRIBES DISCRETION. AT SUCH TIME AS THEIR OWN CULTURAL SPIRITUAL AND LOGISTICS ALLOW. TROUBLE IS IT AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE POLICY. TRIBAL AUTHORITIES ARE TO BE PERMITTED REASONABLE ACCESS TO EXAMINE ITEMS IN ORDER TWO EVALUATE THE CULTURAL AFFILIATION. THERE ALSO TO BE GIVEN REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY UPON REQUEST TO RESENT THEIR VIEWS ORALLY OR IN WRITING TO CAMPUS OFFICIALS. THE PERSPECTIVES OF SUCH TRIBAL AUTHORITIES MUST BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING CULTURAL AFFILIATION. ARE YOU SEE POLICY REQUIRES EACH CAMPUS WITH A COVERED COLLECTION TO HAVE A LIAISON. TO CULTIVATE A POSITIVE RELATION SHIP WITH NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES TO MAKE UNIVERSITY COLLECTIONS OF NATIVE REMAINS AND ITEMS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL TRIBES. AND TO ASSIST TRIBES IN UNDERSTANDING AND INVOKING THE REPATRIATION PROCESS THE LIAISON. AS ASSIST TRIBES IN PLANNING FOR REPATRIATION OF CULTURAL AFFILIATED ITEMS AND FACILITATES EXAMINATION OF CULTURALLY IDENTIFIABLE ITEMS BUT TROUBLE AUTHORITIES AND I WILL SAY. TO OF OUR CAMPUSESHAVE ACTUALLY HELPED THE TRIBES FIND LEON FOR THE REPATRIATION ON ON PROPERTY OWNED BY THE CAMPUSES. I WANTED TO POINT OUT JUST A COUPLE OF. MISCONCEPTIONS THAT SEEM TO BE IN AB TWENTY THIRTY SIX ONE IS THAT THERE'S A HIS. OKAY THE HISTORY OF RESISTANCE TO COMPLY WITH REPATRIATION. WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT THE TRIBES MAY DISAGREE WITH SOME OF OUR DETERMINATIONS HOWEVER IT CAMPUS IS COMMITTED THE FACT THAT THE TRIBE MAY DISAGREE WITH THE DETERMINATION DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE CAMPUS IS RESISTANT TO COMPLYING WITH LEGAL MANDATES. THE ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT. THAT THERE'S VERY PRESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP ALLEN AND THINGS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME FRUSTRATION CAUSED BY OPPOSING VIEWS BUT WE BELIEVE THE OPPOSING VIEWS SHOULD NOT BE LEGISLATIVELY SILENCED. SO OFTEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL OF POSITIONS PLEASE COME FOR. IT DAVID KEENE TANA WITH THE HOUSE BAND OF CAHUILLA INDIANS HAVE POLITICS I AM NOT IN OPPOSITION. BUT I MISS THE SUPPORT IN AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT FOR IT TO BE A HUSBAND COULD BE AYE AND INSTEAD MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ON THE RECORD. I STRONGLY SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THINK WE'LL MAKE SURE YOU PUT ON THE RECORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS. BUT IF YOU A QUESTION TO YOU SEE IS A REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SAT DOWN YET WITH THE AUTHOR. WITH THE TRIBES DISCUSSES THIS YEAR WITH THE BILL BEING INTRODUCED. I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF OF TIME AND RESOURCES MY COLLEAGUES ARE IN OAKLAND AND. WEIRD JUST UNABLE TO GET OURSELVES ORGANIZED PRIOR TO THE HEARING TODAY TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ADMITTING YET BUT WILL. CERTAINLY DO SO VERY SHORTLY AFTER THE SAGA. IT'S A PERFECT DAY. OKAY I IAN OFFICE OF THIS BILL IS THE SPELLS BEEN AROUND AND INTRODUCE EARLY THIS YEAR EH FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I. READY NOW SUCCESS NIGHT IT WAS REALLY MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO THE ISSUE AND AND AND FRANKLY IS IS VERY SURPRISING WHAT WHAT I THINK. WE ALL KNOW AND LEARN AND I KNOW NOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SPAN. OUTSTANDING FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES. AND. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED AND AND FRANKLY IT IT IT STRIKES I THINK MANY OF US THAT. THE FACT THAT YOU SEE IS NOT APPROACH THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES AND WE'RE ALL HEARING ABOUT THIS TODAY. AYE AS A CONTINUATION OF OF WHERE YOU SEE HAS BEEN ON THIS ISSUE SO. I'M A VERY MUCH DO HOPE THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE WELL WITH THE AUTHOR. I CERTAINLY PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS BILL ARE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO MAKE A MOTION MOVE IT FORWARD AND. AND. IF IT MAKES SENSE TO THE OFTEN THE SPONSORS HAPPY TO AT MYSELF AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. YOU DO HAVE A MOTION WILL HAVE THE SECOND. MEMBER KNOWS EVERY. THANK YOU AND AND I. ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID A AYE PERCIVAL WOULD LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR JUST TO SHOW SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR. HEARTFELT AND AMAZING PRESENTATION. SO IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE ORDER HAVING HAD THE RESOURCES TO SPEAK WITH THE AUTHOR. IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS WHY HASN'T IT TAKE WHY HAS IT TAKEN TWENTY YEARS. TO GET TO A POINT TO TRY TO FIND RESOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. LEGISLATIVELY. THAT DETERIORATES CONFIDENCE. WHAT WHAT RESPONSE THE AFTER THAT? WELL I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING I THINK MY COLLEAGUE WAS JUST SPEAKING TO THE. LENGTHY AN EXTENSIVE ACTIVITIES ARE UNDERTAKEN AS A RESULT OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW IN THIS AREA BUT IT'S ONE THING TO COMPLY TO FEDERAL MANDATES. IF IT'S NOT RESPECTFUL OR TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR ACCOUNT. WHAT THE TRIBES THEMSELVES ARE TRAINED ADVANCE? SO WHAT IT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S JUST BEEN AN ABSENCE OF. CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BEING AT THE TABLE. AND HAVING THE APPROPRIATE DIALOGUE WITH YOU SO THAT. IT WOULDN'T OF REACH TO THIS POINT. SO WHAT I CAN SAY THAT IS A AGAIN I'M I'M NEW TO THIS FIELD AND TRYING TO COME UP TO SPEED ON THAT HARD BUT I CAMPUS I'M SORRY THAT DOESN'T COVER IT. BUT OUR CAMPUS ENGLISH POWERFUL OUR CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE THE PROCESSES LIKE I SAID OF THE COUPLE OF CAMPUSES THAT HAVE HAD. THE MOST DISPUTES HAVE COMPLETELY OVERHAULED IN THE LAST YEAR THEIR PROPHECIES IN THE COMMITTEES BEING AND AND OUR OFFICE REQUIRES THEM. TO CONSULT WITH AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VIEWS AND CONCERNS OF THE TRIBES. SO I ASK AGAIN. TAKEN TWENTY YEARS TO GET TO THIS POINT. I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THAT THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. OKAY WELL. WE ALL TO OFTEN. WHETHER IN THIS COMMITTEE OR THE COMMITTEES SEE THE INSTITUTIONAL BIASES UNFORTUNATELY. BECAUSE OF HOUSE CERTAIN LAWS. ARE WRITTEN. WHAT DID OF OUR HOMES SAY? SO THERE'S A LOT OF INSTITUTIONAL BIAS EMBEDDED WHERE YOUNG STATE. OR A YOUNG COUNTRY COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING. SO IT'S. I WOULD URGE YOU.

STILL A LOT OF THE REMARKS THAT WERE ALREADY ME. IN MY DISTRICT I REPRESENT EIGHT. EIGHT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES WHICH IS QUITE A BIT AND COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO HAS MORE. AND. THROUGH MY WORK WITH THE DIFFERENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS OVER TWENTY YEARS BEING IN ELECTED OFFICE BOTH LOCALLY AND NOW IN THE ASSEMBLY. I'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND. THE SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE AS WELL AS. THE SACREDNESS OF TRIBAL CULTURE THE SACREDNESS OF TRIBAL RELIGION. THE SACREDNESS OF THEIR HERITAGE. AND THEIR SACRED SITES ON ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT THE TRIBAL. GOVERNMENTS HAVE HAD TO. STRIVE TO PROTECT. AND STRIVE TO TEACH THEIR CHILDREN OVER THE COURSE OF GENERATIONS OF. WITH A HOME A LOT OF HOME. A. ANXIETY AND A LOT OF. A IMPETUS AGAINST THEM ALL THE WAY THROUGH SO I'M. WITH THAT I WAS JUST WONDERING. WHERE THE REMAIN STORED NOW OR HOW ARE THEY WAS HOW WERE THEY STORED? I CAN I HAVEN'T. HAVING BEEN NEWS I HAVEN'T SEEN THE REMAINS MYSELF I KNOW THE SIX CAMPUSES HAVE THEM I KNOW THE BERKELEY HAS THE LARGEST COLLECTION AMONG THE UC SYSTEM.

AND. HE'S HAD DURING HIS COURSE OF WHEN HE WAS. JUST GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL SOMETIMES THE FAMILY WOULD RECONSIDER THAT. AND ASK FOR. THE PERSON BACK SO THAT THEY COULD DO A PROPER BURIAL ON YOU KNOW. AND THAT WAS ALWAYS COMPLIED WITH. BECAUSE OF THAT. YOU KNOW. KIND OF A SACRED BOND THERE BETWEEN LOVED ONES AND THE FAMILIES AND I'M JUST TRY I IT'S IT'S. DIFFICULT TO GET MY HEAD AROUND HOW. TWENTY YEARS THE TRIBES HAVE BEEN WANTING TO HAVE THEIR LOVED ONES RETURN AND. YOU KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF RULES OF LOTS OF BUREAUCRACY AND EVERYTHING BUT. I THINK YOU KNOW AS WAS STATED. UNTIL WE RECOGNIZE THE SACREDNESS. OF. YOU KNOW THE. AND THE RELIGIOUS. IMPORTANCE. OF BOTH THE ARTIFACTS THE REMAINS AND EVERYTHING ELSE WILL NEVER GONNA COME TO. A THE REALIZATION THAT. THE FAMILIES ARE ASKING FROM THE BACK THAT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE SO. PLUS THE LAWS ON THEIR SIDE. SO IT IS FRUSTRATING AND I HOPE. THAT YOU WILL MEET TO GO LEARN YOU KNOW WORK THIS OUT BUT I THINK.

WHO I ARE GOING TO BE MAKING SOME COMMENTS AS WELL? A. IT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT THE FILM INDUSTRY PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. AND THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHERE I'VE BEEN BORN WHERE I WAS RAISED. THEN ESPECIALLY THE GREATER LOS ANGELES COUNTY AREA. MY DISTRICT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN HOME TO THOUSANDS OF INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OF THEATRICAL STAGE EMPLOYEES MEMBERS WHO HAVE WORKED IN LA'S ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA'S FILM TAX CREDIT WAS REVAMPED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO OFFER MORE INCENTIVE. FOR SMALLER PRODUCTIONS TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA FUNDING EXPANDED TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION AND THE AMOUNT OF TAX INCENTIVES AVAILABLE TO. QUALIFIED PRODUCTIONS TRIPLED DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS THERE WERE THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN DIRECT IN STATE SPENDING GENERATED. A TAX CREDIT HAS ALSO PRODUCED A SUSTAINED. TWELVE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED IN THE STATE BY BELOW THE LINE CREW MEMBERS GENERATING AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. IN THEIR WAGES. IT IS VITAL THAT CALIFORNIA WITH ITS LONG HISTORY OF BEING THE LEADER IN ENTERTAINMENT CONTINUE COMPETITIVE POLICIES THAT OFFER MEANINGFUL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO RETAIN AND LOWER POST PRODUCTION. JOBS AND SPENDING. THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF THE EXISTING PROGRAM THAT I HOPE TO EXPAND ON AS MY MOVE UP BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS.
