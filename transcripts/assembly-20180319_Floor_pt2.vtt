01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:23.479 region:rollup2
CIVIL CASES TOOK A BACKSEAT TO

01:06:21.578 --> 01:06:25.148 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CASES.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:27.550 region:rollup2
AND FOR MANY COURTS CIVIL

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:29.152 region:rollup2
DOCKETS WERE AND CONTINUE TO BE

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.486 region:rollup2
GREATLY DELAY.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.455 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:34.924 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP COURTS HELP THOSE WHO

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:36.626 region:rollup2
WERE UNFORTUNATELY LEFT BEHIND

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:38.027 region:rollup2
THOSE SEEKING CIVIL JUSTICE.

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:40.230 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU KNOW CIVIL JUSTICE

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:41.965 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASSES WIDE AND COMPLICATED

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:43.933 region:rollup2
BODIES OF LAW MIGHT CONSTITUTE

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:46.236 region:rollup2
CHAU LAW AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:48.137 region:rollup2
AND CONSUMER LAW. AND HEALTH AND

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:50.106 region:rollup2
WELFARE ACROSS THE BOARD AND IT

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:52.108 region:rollup2
FOCUSES ON PLANES IN PERSONAL

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:52.675 region:rollup2
INJURY CLAIMS FOR DISCRIMINATION

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:55.178 region:rollup2
RETALIATION MISCONDUCT LOST

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:56.980 region:rollup2
JOBS.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:59.382 region:rollup2
AND MANY MANY MORE. AND WHO WAS

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:02.218 region:rollup2
LEFT BEHIND WILL CHILDREN AND

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:04.053 region:rollup2
ELDERS VETERANS BUSINESSES OUR

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:05.955 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORS YOUR RELATIVES ARE

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:07.257 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS WERE LEFT BEHIND.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:08.925 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT EVERYONE IN THIS

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:11.094 region:rollup2
ROOM IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING A

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:11.694 region:rollup2
TIMELY AND FAIR ACCESSIBLE DAY

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:13.563 region:rollup2
IN COURT FOR ARKANSAS

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:15.632 region:rollup2
SHE WENT.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:18.401 region:rollup2
AND THIS MONEY WILL PROVIDE AN

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:20.570 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY. FOR COURTS TO HELP

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.104 region:rollup2
AND HAVE AND RESOLVE CASES IN A

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.939 region:rollup2
TIMELY MANNER IN THE CIVIL

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:24.374 region:rollup2
ARENA.

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:25.708 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:27.610 region:rollup2
WHAT WE KNOW.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:29.979 region:rollup2
IS THERE AN ONSLAUGHT OF CASES

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:31.648 region:rollup2
WAITING TO BE FILED.

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:33.616 region:rollup2
WITH THE FIRES ALONE WERE

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:35.018 region:rollup2
INFORMED THAT ARE RESIDENTS OF

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.920 region:rollup2
FILED MORE THAN FORTY FIVE

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:39.155 region:rollup2
THOUSAND INSURANCE CLAIMS.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.424 region:rollup2
TOTALLY MORE THAN TWELVE BILLION

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.559 region:rollup2
DOLLARS CONCERNING THIRTY TWO

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:44.394 region:rollup2
THOUSAND HOMES AND FOUR THOUSAND

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.328 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.829 region:rollup2
AND SO KNOWING THAT IN

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:48.898 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HAD A

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:50.600 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL DELAY IN OUR CIVIL

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:53.436 region:rollup2
JUSTICE ARENA. AND IN THE

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.804 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATION OF NEW CASES.

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:57.173 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S ONLY TIME IT'S

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:59.943 region:rollup2
REALLY FAIR AT THIS POINT.

01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:01.177 region:rollup2
TO ANNOUNCE IN FOCUS ON A THREE

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:03.279 region:rollup2
TIERED CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:05.114 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE.

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:06.783 region:rollup2
AND THE FIRST YEAR OF THE CIVIL

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:09.118 region:rollup2
JUSTICE REFORM INITIATIVE SHOULD

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:10.920 region:rollup2
BE THAT WE RESTORE COURTHOUSES

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:21.197 region:rollup2
TO THEIR FULL OPERATING HOURS IN

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:21.998 region:rollup2
STAFF.

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:30.139 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROVIDE FAIR

01:08:21.998 --> 01:08:31.874 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION TO OUR CORE FAN.

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:33.443 region:rollup2
AND ALSO AT THE SECOND PART OF

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:35.144 region:rollup2
THIS TWO YEAR.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.646 region:rollup2
I SUGGEST THAT WE EMBRACE THE

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:37.847 region:rollup2
THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE

01:08:36.646 --> 01:08:39.882 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:41.517 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BUDGET WHICH IS TO

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:43.386 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:45.054 region:rollup2
SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS.

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:46.889 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IN TRAFFIC. AND

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:48.825 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE ACCESS.

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:50.727 region:rollup2
AND THIRD I THINK WE SHOULD WORK

01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:52.729 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY TO DEVELOP AN

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:55.264 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:57.467 region:rollup2
CALLED FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:59.068 region:rollup2
LEGAL WAY FINDERS WHO COULD

01:08:57.467 --> 01:09:00.036 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY ASSIST PEOPLE WHO

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:01.804 region:rollup2
COME TO COURT WITHOUT AN

01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:03.206 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:05.074 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT WE COULD WORK

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:08.044 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND ALSO FIND BEST

01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:09.645 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND DRAW ON THE WORK

01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:11.547 region:rollup2
OF OUR SELF HELP PROGRAMS AND

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:13.383 region:rollup2
ARE EXCELLENT VOLUNTEER JUSTICE

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:15.084 region:rollup2
CORE FOLKS WHO ARE USE NOW IN

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:16.352 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO AND THE

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:18.254 region:rollup2
BAY AREA.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:20.923 region:rollup2
SO WHAT COULD LEGAL WAY FINDERS

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:23.359 region:rollup2
DO. WELL LEGAL WAY FINDERS CAN

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:24.927 region:rollup2
MEET PEOPLE AND GUIDED THEM TO

APPROPRIATE COURTHOUSE.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:33.503 region:rollup2
A LEGAL WAY FINDER COULD EXPLAIN

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:35.538 region:rollup2
THE OPTIONS AND THE CONSEQUENCES

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:37.340 region:rollup2

GET IT FILED IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:44.881 region:rollup2
LEGAL WAY FINDER COULD PROVIDE

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:46.149 region:rollup2
REFERRALS FOR SERVICES NOT ONLY

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:47.817 region:rollup2
IN THE COURTROOM BUT OUT IN THE

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:49.519 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:51.154 region:rollup2
A LEGAL WAY FIND A COULD DO THIS

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.655 region:rollup2
ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS OR IN A

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:54.157 region:rollup2
WORKSHOP SETTING.

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:56.793 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE EXAMPLES FROM WHICH

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:58.428 region:rollup2
TO DRAW FOR EXAMPLE A JUSTICE

01:09:56.793 --> 01:10:00.029 region:rollup2
CORPS VOLUNTEER THE DAUGHTER OF

01:09:58.428 --> 01:10:01.664 region:rollup2

TENANTS WHO ARE NEAR EVICTION.

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:13.276 region:rollup2
A SELF HELP ATTORNEY IN ALAMEDA

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:14.844 region:rollup2
TELLS US THAT SHE HELPS PEOPLE

01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:17.380 region:rollup2
FOR ONE DAY AWAY FROM

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:19.015 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.651 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ATTORNEY TELLS US THAT.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:24.153 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THE VALUE

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:26.122 region:rollup2
OF SELF HELP BECAUSE IT PROVIDES

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:28.558 region:rollup2
THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:30.827 region:rollup2

RESIDENTS DESERVE THAT.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.610 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:49.378 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BE THE LEADER IN THIS

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.580 region:rollup2
REGARD.

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:52.381 region:rollup2
ON THE NATIONAL FRONT WE HAVE

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.083 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED DISRUPTION ATTACKS

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:55.952 region:rollup2
ON THE FREE PRESS

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:57.053 region:rollup2
THREATS TO THE RULE OF CIVILITY

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:59.722 region:rollup2
THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL

01:10:57.053 --> 01:11:02.425 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE BUT. FORTUNATELY.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:03.459 region:rollup2
OUR FOUNDERS FOCUSED MUCH ON THE

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.527 region:rollup2
LIMITS OF POWER IN THE

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.628 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION WHEN THEY

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:07.263 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED THE THREE BRANCHES

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:09.365 region:rollup2
OF GOVERNMENT.

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:12.034 region:rollup2
THE CHECKS AND BALANCES AS WELL

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:14.036 region:rollup2
AS ADOPTING THE BILL OF RIGHTS

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:16.005 region:rollup2
AND BUILDING A FEDERAL SYSTEM

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:18.374 region:rollup2
THAT STILL RECOGNIZES. THE

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:20.009 region:rollup2
RIGHTS OF STATES TO GOVERN SOME

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:21.778 region:rollup2
OF THEIR OWN BUSINESS

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:23.546 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:25.715 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT TO GOVERN ITS

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:29.352 region:rollup2
LITIGATED IN FEDERAL COURT.

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:31.587 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:34.056 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY THE LAW DAY THEME

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:37.360 region:rollup2
