WE WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START OUR JUNE EIGHTEENTH. HEARING WE DO HAVE QUORUM AND I WILL ASK YOU [inaudible] AND FOR THE ROLL CALL PLEASE LIMON [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] AND THAT'S MEDICARE [inaudible] HERE. FOR HERE'S A LITTLE BIT CANNABIS [inaudible] FOR CERVANTES. NOT THIS YEAR CHOI. CHOICE HERE [inaudible] YEAH. SALAS PLANET. ENOUGH EIGHT MINUTES GRAYSON [inaudible] YEARS. ALRIGHT WE'RE STARTING WEEK. AND I DO WANT TO WELCOME OUR NEWEST MEMBER TO THE BANKING COMMITTEE AND THAT I ASSEMBLY MEMBER AG APRIL SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING OUR BANKING COMMITTEE. SO WITH THAT WE WILL I START WITH S. B.. EIGHT THREE NO JUST KIDDING NINE THIRTY WERE STARTING WITH NINE THIRTY YES. I WILL HAVE YOU GO AHEAD AND START. IRWIN WE HAVE ENOUGH. FOR PURPOSES OF BROADCASTING TO THE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THIS HEARING. THREE PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING THIS HEARING. MY MOM IS WATCHING HIS HEARING OKAY [inaudible] TO GO. SO SO THIS BILL IS A ESTABLISHES A LIMITED A CHARTER CANNABIS BANK. SPONSORS SITTING TO MY LEFT. BOARD OF EQUALIZATION MEMBER SOON TO BE A HOPE TREASURER TO THE CALIFORNIA FIONA MAW. BOB NOW WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHY DO WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA 57% CLIP DECIDED TO MAKE CANNABIS LEGAL. BUT IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE CANNABIS IS SCHEDULE ONE DRUG. UNDER THE LAW AND THE FEDERAL LAW YOU CAN'T TAKE ILLICIT GAINS FROM ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES AND PUT IN THE BANK. SO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT I'M TOLD BY THE SENATE REPRESENTS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE FISH TWO BILLION DOLLARS BURIED IN BARRELS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF HORRIBLE PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE BUDGET THAT WE JUST PASSED PEOPLE ASKING FOR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS FOR BULLET PROOF GLASS AND ALL SORTS OF STUFF BECAUSE GOVERNMENT CAN'T TAKE IN THE CASH [inaudible] BIG PROBLEM. WE GET A MOTION ON THE FLOOR TO THE SECOND SO BOTTOM LINE IS TO CUT TO THE CHASE BECAUSE WE GOT A BILL THAT'S MOVIN. AND I GIVE IT TURNED OVER TO THE SPONSOR THIS MEASURE. IS IS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF BANKING. AND KANA BOLT ON A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY WITH VERY LIMITED PURPOSES THE IDEA IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY TO GET AS MUCH CASH OUT OF THE SYSTEM. THERE'S NEARLY A THOUSAND BANK BRANCHES IN CALIFORNIA THAT REMAIN EMPTY BECAUSE BANK BRANCHES ARE CLOSING SO THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO OPEN A BANK QUICKLY. ASIDE FROM GOVERNMENT BLAH BLAH AND WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN THE IN THE DEVELOPMENT WORLD WHERE BACK A LOT OF SMALLER BANKS HAVE STARTED AND THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS INTEREST WE BOTH HARD SINCE WE'VE DONE THIS BILL. FOR A LOT OF FOLKS THAT WANT TO DO BANKS. BRIEFLY ALTERNATE OVER TO THAT OUGHT TO THE SPONSOR IS ONE THAT YOU CAN PAY YOUR TAXES AND FEES. WITH THE SPECIAL PURPOSE CHECKS AND WE HAVE A BIG ONE HERE THAT ELIZABETH HAVE BIGGER THAN HER RIGHT THERE THAT BASICALLY LIMITS ITS PURPOSE AND IT'S A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM. TO YOU CAN PAY YOUR RENT THREE YOU CAN PAY FOR YOUR VENDORS AND FOR YOU CAN INVEST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JOBS PUBLIC SAFETY. AND GET THE CASH AT LEAST TEMPORARILY UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES THINGS NOW WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT MAKES SOME COMMENT IN THAT REGARD BUT JUST LAST WEEK THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TURNED DOWN A BILL. TO THE IDEA OF HER LONG ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS NOT WISE WE THINK IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR US TO TRY TO TAKE ANYTHING QUITE WE CAN DO. TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE TURN OVER HIM. SO THANK YOU -- WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION NOVEMBER? TWO THOUSAND OF FOURTEEN ITEM I FOUND OUT THAT THE BOARD WAS SUPPOSED TO COLLECT SALES TAX ON DISPENSARIES SO I ASKED HOW MUCH. DO WE COLLECTED NOBODY KNEW THE ANSWER. ALL A PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE SCHEDULE ONE NATURE BUT SECONDLY AB ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WAS THE LACK OF BACKING ACCESS. AND SO WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT OR TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WE COLLECTED. OF THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY WE FIGURED WE COLLECTED ABOUT FORTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND I THINK THAT'S ONLY ABOUT ACTUALLY DO AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE CANNOT AUDIT. CASH SO WE NEED A PAPER TRAIL AND NOT ONLY IS THIS BILL GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT IT ALSO IS GOING TO CREATE THAT PAPER TRAILS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING. THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES IN SHORT. PHIL AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AGAIN I WILL JUST KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT AND AND JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE SENATOR AND MISS MY THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT.

CAROL I GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE STONE. STONE AYE WEBER [inaudible] WEBER I THREE THE BILL HAS SEVEN I WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHER I'M MEMBERS TO ADAM. THANK YOU AND SIT NEXT TO US SENATOR HERTZBERG WE HAVE S. B. THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD HAVE PERMISSION TO ASK A HOW MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE HURT KNOW WHAT THE BLOCKCHAIN IS OKAY. I'M GONNA MAKE IT SHORT MADAM CHAIR. SO. LOOK HERE'S THE DEAL THERE IS A REVOLUTION GOING ON IN OUR MIDST THIS IS CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE CUTTING EDGE I WENT TO THE TECHNOLOGY CARCASS. AND A NUMBER OF FOLKS DID KNOW WHAT THE BLOCKCHAIN WAS AND IT'S GENERALLY LIMITED IN ITS UNDERSTANDING WITH RESPECT TO BITCOIN. AND THAT'S A VERY VERY LIMITED IDEA IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT THAT THE INTERNET ONLY RELATES TO AMAZON BOOKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY TOOL. THAT IN MY JUDGMENT IS THE NEXT STEP OF WHERE THE INTERNET GOES AND WISE IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT OFFERS TO FUNDAMENTAL DIMENSIONS ONE A MUCH DEEPER LEVEL OF SECURITY IN TERMS OF DATA ON THE INTERNET AND TO IT% OFFERS IN MY JUDGMENT WILL SEE DOWN THE LINE MARK MY WORDS. A REAL ABILITY TO EQUALIZE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING -- AND AND RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE SELLING YOUR DATA ALL DAY LONG IN MAKING MONEY ON IT AND THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER. AND THE POOR MAKING NOTHING ON IT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY GET PAID AND LIKE REWARDS POINTS IF YOU WILL ULTIMATELY WORK GOES WHAT IS THE IDEA BEHIND THE BLOCKCHAIN IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS SIMPLEST TERMS. RIGHT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THE INTERNET BASICALLY GOT A BIG POOL OF INFORMATION AND WHAT STOPS IT FROM FROM PEOPLE GETTING ACCESS TO WHAT IS IN ESSENCE. CODES THAT THAT WOULD THAT THAT STOP PEOPLE FROM GETTING IN BUT ONCE THEY BREAK IN WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED AT UCLA. AT THE STATE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE BLOCKCHAIN IS BY ITS NATURE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT AND IN ESSENCE EACH PIECE OF DATA HOUSE. OUR UNIQUE NUMBER. IT HAS A NUMBER THAT'S ATTACHED TO THIS PIECE OF DATA A NUMBER THAT'S ATTACHED TO THIS SPEECH TODAY TO AND IT'S DATED IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B.. YOU HAVE TO TRACE EVERYTHING ALONG THE LINE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK THE CODE THAT'S WHITE STARTED WITH BIG POINT IF IF ANYBODY SAW RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A SERIES OF ADS ON TELEVISION FOR A MAJOR COMPANY ADVERTISING BLOCKCHAIN. FOR PURPOSES OF TRACKING WITH ITS PACKAGES OF THE DIAMOND RING ON YOUR FINGER OR WHATEVER ELSE IT MAY BE. AND SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS I WANTED TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO INTRODUCE THIS NOTION THE LEGISLATURE I STARTED OUT WITH THE CONCEPT. OF OF DOING NON TITLE A LAND TITLE I MET WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF AND WHAT TO IN THE ISLANDS IT HE SAYS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT WE COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THE TITLE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL. PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS WANTED TO MERGING BIRTH CERTIFICATES AND DRIVER'S LICENSES FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WANT PHONE IT UP. I COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYS TOO COMPLICATED SO HOW CAN I STICK MY TOE IN THE WATER WORLD THAT BEGINS TO IT INTRODUCED THIS CONCEPT AND WHAT WE DID. WAS TO DO IT IN THE AREA OF CORPORATIONS CLOSELY HELD CORPORATIONS THAT ARE FORMED IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO IF YOU WANT OF DUKE DO A BILL BLOCKCHAIN YOU COULD PUT THAT THE BUT WHAT WE SAID IN THIS BILL WHICH YOU CAN PUT THE INFORMATION ON YOUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. AND THEN YOU COULD BASICALLY USE A BLOCKCHAIN METHODOLOGY DISTRIBUTED LEDGER FOR PURPOSES OF MAINTAINING YOUR SHERIFF TICKETS WISE THAT RELEVANT IN TERMS OF A PUBLIC POLICY AGENDA GIVE TWO BRIEF EXAMPLES OF LIKE CLOTHES. AND TURN OVER THE WITNESSES. ONE WE HAD A SITUATION IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE -- SOMEBODY OPENED UP A PHONY ACCOUNT BANK ACCOUNT WHICH OF THE SAME NAME AS THE BONDING COMPANY AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT. THEY THEY THEY WERE ABLE TO STEAL THE MONEY AND MOVE VIA THE RECOUNT RIGHT WE SEE THE ORANGE COUNTY THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH STOCK CERTIFICATES. IF YOU SEE YOUR FUTURE IF IT IF YOU GO TO A BANK AND ONE OPEN ACCOUNT SAYS THAT  HAVE BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER THE BANK OR WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T PHONY IT UP. AND SO THE IDEA WAS AT LEAST A TOE IN THE WATER THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST AMONG OF AMONG SILICON VALLEY TO DO THIS. IT'S A FIRST STEP. AND THAT WAS IT. AND I WONDER MY EXPERT WITNESSES AND WATCHING SINCE WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND I'LL ASK FOR SUPPORTERS AYE. TO BE AT THE CONFLICT THAT WILL THINK YOU. THANK YOU FOR AM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AND COMMITTEE. I AM JOSEPH A RAIL AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE BLOCKCHAIN ADVOCACY COALITION. AND TO SPEAK ON SENATE BILL. EIGHT THREE THE BLOCKCHAIN SHARE CERTIFICATE EXCHANGE. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE MY PERSONAL FACT FINDING RESEARCH HAS REVEALED TO ME AND MANY OTHERS THE BENEFITS A BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT SOME QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN BEFORE WE GET. TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS I LIKE TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND MYSELF. I AM A FORMER FINGER REGISTER SECURITIES ADVISER AND TRADER. I'VE SPENT MORE THAN FIVE YEARS IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY BEFORE LEAVING TO PURSUE ADVANCED EDUCATION. AND TO ENTER THE BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRY SPACE. I HAVE BOOTSTRAPPED A BLOCKCHAIN SERVICE BUSINESS CALLED CAGE CHAIN. AND I ENVISION THERE BEING A FRIENDLY [inaudible] REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR BLOCKCHAIN BASED BUSINESSES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES -- GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR YOU THIS EVENING MY NAME IS KAMAL HOVERED. AND I REPRESENT THE BLOCKCHAIN ABBAS ADVOCACY COOK COALITION ALONG WITH. ALL MARKET INCORPORATED. WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA BASED BLOCKCHAIN COMPANY. ON MY FIRST CAME ACROSS DUH. WATCHING TECHNOLOGY IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHILE I WAS CONDUCTING RESEARCH AT STANFORD'S ROCK CENTER FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE WHICH IS A JOINT COLLABORATION. BETWEEN THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND STANFORD LAW SCHOOL EVER SINCE THEN I BECAME INTRIGUED AND ENAMORED BY THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND HAVE BEEN STUDYING AND RESEARCHING EVER SINCE -- EIGHT THREE EIGHT AND IT'S EFFORT TO DEFINE WHAT BLOCKCHAIN IS AND ALLOW COMPANIES TO TRANSFER STOCK ISSUANCES OVER UP WATCHING TECHNOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTED LEDGERS. SOME YOU MAY BE ASKING WHAT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS AND I WILL HELP ONCE AGAIN TO DEFINE IT. IT IS AN ELECTRONIC LEDGER OF TRANSACTIONS TAKING PLACE ACROSS A DECENTRALIZED NETWORK. WHERE PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO VERIFY TRANSACTIONS? WITHOUT THE NEED OF A CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY EVERY TRANSACTION IS SECURED. USING BANK GRADE SECURITY ENCRYPTION. AND IS ASSIGNED A REFERENCE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER FOR TRANSPARENCY IN AUDIT PURPOSES. BLOCKCHAIN HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE NUMEROUS SECTORS IN INDUSTRIES WITHIN THE STATE. AND DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SENSIBLE OUR REGULATIONS SUCH AS S. B.. EIGHT THREE EIGHT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AT THIS TIME AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR YOU. GREAT ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. CNN ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CNN I'LL TAKE IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. S. AMBER SOME. I JUST JUST THE COMET I'M AND SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I THINK LOOKING AT DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES IS IS IS GOOD AND IS INTERESTING. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THAT ULTIMATELY HAS TO GET OUT WITH HIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLOCKCHAIN THE BLOCKCHAIN PUBLIC KEY PRIVATE KEY. ENCRYPTION AT ITS AT ITS SIMPLEST ME THAT'S REALLY. ULTIMATELY ALL THAT IT IS IN THERE SOME PROTECT BUT UNDER THE EXISTING BLOCKCHAIN BITCOIN FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S BEEN USE IT HAS SOME VULNERABILITIES WHEN. WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH OR WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE USING IT? YOU DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE ANOTHER CHAIN APPAREL CHAIN THAT'S CREATED SO IF YOU'RE USING. IF YOUR SAMPLE SIZES ARE SMALL AS POTENTIALLY NUMBER OF FOLKS IN A CLOSELY HELD CORPORATION. AND YOU USING THAT AS A MECHANISM TO TRACK THE THE STOCK AND ANY STOCK TRANSACTIONS BECAUSE JUST TRACKING THE STOCK. IRA Y. WOULD NEED YOU SOMETHING THIS COMPLICATED. BUT IF WHAT YOU DO IS TRY TO TRACK. TRANSACTIONS THEN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT THE BLOCKCHAIN CAN BE SOMETHING THAT'S EFFECTIVE FOR BUT IF YOU HAVE A SMALL ENOUGH NUMBER OF USERS IN THAT. THEN YOU HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF OF HAVING A SECONDARY CHAIN THAT'S GREAT ADVICE BUT BY FOLKS THAT COME IN AND PARTICULARLY REPLICATE THAT DATA ESPECIALLY. PRIOR TO THAT THAT THE NEXT WHATEVER THE NEXT BLOCK IS BEING VERIFIED SO THEY CREATE A COMPETING BLOCK THAT THEN GETS VERIFIED BEFORE YOUR EXISTS IN THIS INTO THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. BEFORE YOUR CURRENT POCKETS TECH GETS VERIFIED. THEN THE FRAUDULENT CHAIN NOW BECOMES THE PRIMARY CHAIN AND YOU'VE NOW ABSOLUTELY CORRUPTED YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE INTEGRITY IN IN YOUR SYSTEM. AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THINGS THAT I THINK THAT THOSE WHO WERE DOING THE RESEARCH AND REALLY DIGGING INTO INTO BOXING TECHNOLOGY. IT HAS SOME REALLY INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES BUT ALSO HAS SOME VULNERABILITIES IN FOR MANY USES FOR SOMETHING INSIGNIFICANT SECURITIES. WHICH I THINK IS VERY VIABLE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE THERE THAT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE IN PLACE. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SITUATION THAT WE'RE CREATING A PHANTOM CHAIN THAT THEN. OVER ESSENTIALLY OVERRIDES IN AND OVER VALIDATES THE THAT THE PRIMARY CHAIN RECORD THE ORIGINAL CHANGE SO SETTING UP THE POSSIBILITY HAS GOT TO BE THERE BUT WHAT I THINK WHEN THE PIECE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED. IS THAT IS SOMETHING TO TO BE ABLE TO VERIFY AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS IN FACT [inaudible] SECURITY. AROUND HOW THAT CHANGE DEVELOPS OVER TIME AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE THE VIABLE CHANGE AND NOT THE PHANTOM CHAIN THAT GETS THEN BUILD AND TAKES OVER KNOW THE AUTHORITY OF THAT THAT. THE CHAIN THAT IS THE THAT IS THE THAT IS THE AUTHORIZED AND SO. BA YEAH GREAT INTERESTING BUT I I HAVEN'T SEEN IMPLEMENTATIONS YET THAT WE'RE QUITE THERE BUT AS FAR AS OPENING UP THE POSSIBILITY AND SIMILAR CALDERON HAS A BILL TO ASK THE STATE TO LOOK AT BLOCKING TECHNOLOGIES. THAT'S I THINK A MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO BUILD IN THE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST AND THE THE PROTECTIONS AROUND IT REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE. OF THE USERS FEAR THAT THAT ARE USING THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY. GOOD SO BUT I THINK THIS IS THIS APPROPRIATE STEP AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU SOME NUMBERS SHOWN A SOMBER JUDGE I THANK YOU IDEA -- WOULD BE SUPPORTING NOT DISARM SADDAM NOT MY UNDERSTANDING -- USING -- BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO A RECORD -- OR THE TRANSACTION A INFORMATION NAMES IN -- WHATEVER ELMONT CYCAS. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS SO A NEW. AUTHORIZATION USING THE PLOT CHAIN VERSUS ARE. ALREADY ARE. MY OWNERSHIP OF A CERTAIN STOCK IS ALREADY. UP CAPTURE THE IN. BY THE BE SURE. HA HA MANY SHARES HIGH HAVE. SO WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE US NUMBER ONE QUESTION NUMBER -- TO QUESTION AND JUST TO FINISH UP IS THAT THE ARE. IT IS SAID THE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES SAME AS SOMETHING I HEARD THAT BITCOIN. THAT I CAN USE. OBVIOUSLY I I I I CAN I CAN CASH OUT THE MY YOU KNOW THE STOCK WORDINGS AND THAT THAT IS A CASH BUT THE IT IS OF VERY CONTROVERSIAL -- ABOUT THAT THE BITCOIN NATURE BUT THE WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS I MAY BE. THIS OUR TECHNICIANS SECOND CAN EXPLAIN FOR THE THE DISTINGUISHING -- FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THIS SO IT QUEENS AND THE BLACK CHAIN. OF RECORDING. YEAH FIRST OF ALL THE THE IDEA OF THE LEDGER THE WRITTEN LEDGER. BUT OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE ENGAGED IN THIS SERIES OF LEGISLATION TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S OLD STUFF. BUT WE HAD PROBLEMS OF ALL HAVE BEEN ONLY WHAT SIGNATURES COULD USE A FAX TRANSMISSION COULD YOU USE DOCUSIGN. BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS IS TRYING TO UPDATE THE LAW. AS TO FINDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND DEFINED IN THE LAW AND SO THIS DOES THAT NUMBER. ONE TWO I THINK IT HELPS PRESENT PROTECT AGAINST FRAUD BECAUSE WITH YOU WANT TO USE IT YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. IF SOMEBODY WERE TO GO TO A BANK THEY WOULD THEN ASK THE QUESTION A OF OF OF WHERE THE LEDGER WAS AND IT'S A BETTER WAY TO PROTECT IT. SO IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE WERE MODERNIZING THE LAW AND HAVING INCREMENTAL CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO SOME LEVEL OF SECURITY. THE IDEA BLOCKCHAIN IS JUST SIMPLY ONE OF THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOU BUILD ON BUT SHE'S MADE -- BITCOIN IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY MANY A WASTE TO UTILIZE THE BLOCKCHAIN THE BLOCKCHAIN IS THE FOUNDATION ALMOST LIKE THE INTERNET AND AN ARM THAT IS USED FOR DIFFERENT THINGS. IT BECAME HAD NOTORIETY AND IT'S OUT SET BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN WAS REALLY THE PLACE WHERE SHE IS ME BITCOIN WAS THE PLACE WHERE WE FIRST STARTED. YET SO IT'S USUALLY NO NEXUS BETWEEN THE TWO EXCEPT FOR THE BIT COINS BE USING THE BLOCKCHAIN HERE WE'RE NOT AS IS NO CONNECTION AND WHAT WE'RE DOING THAT POINT AT ALL YOU WILL THROUGH BUT POINT AS A RESULT OF THIS. OKAY. THINK. THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALRIGHT THIS BILL DOES HAVE A DO PASSED TO ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE. THAT RECOMMENDATION AND WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND PLACES ARE CLOSED I JUST SAY SOMETHING FORMS FINTECH FIFTY LIST FIFTY TOP FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES GLOBALLY. ELEVEN OF THOSE COMPANIES A BLOCKCHAIN COMPANIES THIS IS NOT A SMALL BALL DEAL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WAS INVESTED IN THESE KINDS OF COMPANIES. THIS IS A BIG DEAL IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO STEP TAKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO START ENGAGING IN THIS PROCESS ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG.

I COULD HAVE MADE THANK YOU CENTER AT YOUR PLEASURE OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SO. OF I LIKE -- TO IT'S MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT THIS BILL S. B. -- EIGHT ONE EIGHT THIS IS INVOLVING THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS OF CALIFORNIA. OF FORECLOSURE CRISIS DOESN'T SEEM TO GO AWAY AND IT'S STILL HERE [inaudible] SO -- THIS BILL -- THAT WE PRESENT TODAY. DEALS WITH A CRISIS SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE NEVER FULLY RECOVERED AT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY AND THAT'S REALLY THE TRUTH OKAY -- MANY OF OUR CALIFORNIA'S LOS HOMES -- IN A LOT OF WAYS WRONGLY BECAUSE WE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY REALLY -- REGULATE -- MORTGAGE SERVICING INDUSTRY. THE STATE FINALLY TOOK ACTION AND TWENTY TWELVE THIS WAS THE HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS. IT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN. THE LAWS GIVE HOMEOWNERS THE BUILDINGS TO POSTPONE FORECLOSURE OF TO SERVICER FAILED TO FOLLOW THE RULES. THEY ALSO GIVE SERVICES THE ABILITY TO CORRECT ERRORS AND THEN PROCEED WITH THE FORECLOSURE IF IT WAS WARRANTED. THE LAW DIDN'T STOP -- FORECLOSURES BUT GAVE HOMEOWNERS A FAIR CHANCE TO SAVE THEIR HOMES. AND IT WORK. THIS THIS JANUARY THE HOME OUR BILL OF RIGHTS BECAME WEAKER BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE SUNSET OF THAT LAW. S. B. EIGHT ONE EIGHT WILL RESTORE THE HOMEOWNERS BILL OF RIGHTS TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM. THE THERE THESE ARE COMMONSENSE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. OF THAT HAVE BEEN AND STATUS QUO FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. I'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF PAIN POINTS THAT THEY HAVE. AND IN THE HOMEOWNER BILL WRITES A PROPOSAL. AND HAVE AGREED TO TAKE TO AMENDMENTS WHICH WILL REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION. THE FIRST AMENDMENT ADDS THE DEADLINE BUT WHAT BY WHICH THE HOMEOWNER NEEDS TO SUBMIT A LOAN MODIFICATION. APPLICATION FIVE BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE THE SCHEDULES FORECLOSURE STATE. AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM [inaudible] AMENDMENT. THE SECOND AMENDMENT A CLARIFIES THAT IF A BORROWER REQUEST IN WRITING THE LOAN SERVICERS STOP CONTACTING THEM. ABOUT THE MORTGAGE LOAN. THE SERVICES THE SERVICES OR SERVICER IS ABLE TO DO SO. OF MY STAFF HAS WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. OUGHT TO FINALIZE LANGUAGE IS BEFORE THIS BILL IS IT ONE EIGHT IS HEARD IN THEM ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AND I BELIEVE THE FORMER FORMER OPPOSITION INSERTED THE AID TO TESTIFIED OF OUR AGREEMENT. THAT WE HAVE MADE. EVERY HOMEOWNER DESERVES A FAIR TRANSPARENT PROCESS AND BEFORE LOSING THEIR HOMES. AND KEEP YOUR HOME CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE SERVED A STATE PROGRAM -- RECEIVED OVER TO TH TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FROM FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED HOMEOWNERS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LAW. TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND THREE IT'S AMAZING. HOMEOWNERS HIT BY FIRES IN OUR WINE COUNTRY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FACE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. OR AT RISK ALSO OF LOSING AND DEFAULTING ON MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. CONGRESS AND FEDERAL REGULATORS ARE HARD AT WORK DISMANTLING POLICIES THAT A PROTECTIVE HOMEOWNERS IN BORROWERS FROM THE KIND OF PREDATORY MORTGAGE LOANS THAT HELP BECAUSE THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS IN THE BEGINNING. CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT SIT. AND WAIT FOR ANOTHER FORECLOSURE CRISIS WE ALREADY HAVE OUR OUR HOUSING CRISIS WE WE NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES FORECLOSURES HURT FAMILIES NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE. AND MAKE SURE VULNERABLE HOMEOWNERS HAVE PROTECTIONS IN THE PLACE AND I HAVE WITNESSES MADAM CHAIR ALTERNATE OVER TO THE WITNESSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION CLICK -- WE ARE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT ONE EIGHT THIS CERTAINLY WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HELP HOMEOWNERS STAY IN THEIR HOMES IF THEY ARE IN FACT FACING A FORECLOSURE AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REESTABLISH THESE PROTECTIONS. THESE PROTECTIONS GAVE HOMEOWNERS A FIGHTING CHANCE TO SAVE THEIR HOMES IT WAS ALMOST A SENSE THAT IT WAS. DUE PROCESS IF YOU WILL -- IT THROUGH THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS TO GIVE HOMEOWNERS RIGHTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE BEST TO FIX THEIR SITUATION CALIFORNIA WAS GROUND ZERO IN pMAJOR DEVASTATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AFTER THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS DID LOSE THEIR HOME CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA DID MOVE FORWARD AND TO ESTABLISH THE HOMEOWNERS BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH WENT FAR. CLICK OF THE COALITION OF MOSTLY LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS WITH ATTORNEYS WHO SPECIALIZE IN CONSUMER ON CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS DURING THAT TIME OUR ATTORNEYS HAD LARGE VOLUMES OF CASES. THAT COULD NOT MOVE FORWARD BAR WORDS NEVER HAD A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SAVE THEIR HOME. WHILE THEY WERE SEEKING LOAN MODIFICATIONS THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS ON THEIR HOME KEPT GOING. SERVICES WERE LOSING DOCUMENTS LEFT AND RIGHT AND FAMILIES WERE SUFFERING THROUGH A MAZE OF A PROCESS AND WEREN'T GIVEN ACCURATE RELIABLE UNNECESSARY INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO SAVE THEIR HOMES. FAMILIES WERE LEFT HOMELESS NEIGHBORHOODS WERE LEFT EMPTY AND OUR COMMUNITIES WERE ESSENTIALLY LEFT BLIGHTED ONCE THE TWENTY TWELVE BILL WAS IMPLEMENTED OUR ATTORNEY CITED THAT THESE BARRIERS AND IMPEDIMENTS ACTUALLY STOPPED TO PAY FEES TO EXIST. FAMILIES DESERVE A FAIR CHANCE TO SAVE THEIR HOMES WE THINK THE HOMEOWNERS BILL OF RIGHTS DOES DO THAT AND WE URGE YOU TO RE ESTABLISH THESE PROTECTIONS AND ASK YOUR AYE BOAT THANK YOU.
