FINISH ALL OF THE ISSUES IN IN

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:13.643
ONE ORGANIZATION THEY'LL BE ONE

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.679
ORGANIZATION AS A PRIMARY

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:18.315
CONTACT POINT THERE WON'T BE-

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:19.282
TALK TO PUBLIC HEALTH OR TALK

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.617
TO CDFA BECAUSE THAT INVOLVES

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.552
THEM SO I THINK THAT'S GOING.

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:24.921
TO BE VERY HELPFUL- AS WE WORK

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.022
WITH THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:27.891
AS WE WORK WITH OUR LICENSEES

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:30.727
AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.162
THAT WE PARTNER WITH. I'M

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:41.171
COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS.

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:42.806

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:43.707
OPERATION YOU HAVE A LOT OF

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:46.410

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.019
DOING THINGS THAT THAT ARE

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.788
SWORN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.623

AFFECTED STATE OF FORTY MILLION

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:10.167
PEOPLE. IN THE NUMBER OF

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:12.002
BUSINESSES DOING CANNABIS. NO

00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:14.604
MATTER WHAT IT IS THAT IS

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:17.140
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. WHEN YOU

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:18.975
LOOK AT IT CAN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:20.343
A PRODUCTION THAT THAT THE

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:23.513
GROWS- THE MANUFACTURING THE

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.482
RETAIL HOW CAN SEVENTY SIX

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:28.852
OFFICERS. DO ANY TYPE OF

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:31.755
SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATION.

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:34.224
PERIOD THEY ARE MEANING IF YOU

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:35.292
LOOK AT THE OPERATIONS TALK

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:36.493
ABOUT EARLIER IN THOSE

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.161
INVESTIGATIONS THAT'S JUST

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:40.297
BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:42.232
TO DEAL WITH IT IT'S JUST A

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:45.001
IT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE HELP ME

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:47.604
REALIZE HOW THAT IS. AND THEN

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.539
MIND YOUR TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.541
SPENT TEN YEARS IN OUR CLOCKS

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:52.108
ARRESTEE WHY NARCOTICS TASK

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:54.377
FORCE. IT'S BEEN THIRTY YEARS

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:55.245
INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS AND ONE

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:57.113
TALKING ABOUT SO WHEN I SAY

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.949
IT'S WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. I'M

00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:01.151
SPEAKING FROM A POSITION OF

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:04.521
EXPERTISE WITH THIS. SO THAT'S

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:07.891
A CONCERN OF MINE. BUT HERE YOU

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.125
ARE REPRESENTING THE AGENCY

00:52:09.192 --> 00:52:13.530
TELLING ME THAT ADEQUATE. HOW

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:14.064
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:17.400
PLEASE. SO I THINK THERE'S A

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:19.970
COUPLE OF FACETS WHEN IS THAT

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:21.705
THE YOU KNOW LICENSED

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:23.974
INVESTIGATIONS ARE COMPLIANCE

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.710
UNITS WILL CANCEL THOSE- THOSE

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:27.811
OF THE NON SWORN BUT THEY'RE

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.012
DOING THOSE INVESTIGATIONS OF

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:30.647
REALLY TO LICENSEES AT TIMES

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:32.148
THERE'S CROSSOVER WITH OUR LAW

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:34.351
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SO THERE

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.419
IS A LARGE GROUP- OF

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.321
INVESTIGATORS AND INSPECTORS

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:40.457
THAT WILL BE FOCUSING ON ON

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.893
THOSE. THAT INVOLVE LICENSEES

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:44.528
FOR THE UNLICENSED WE DO HAVE

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:45.962
THE SEVENTY SIX ONE AT THIS

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.931
POINT IN TIME- AND WE'RE

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:49.499
FILLING THOSE POSITIONS WE ARE

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:51.234
WORKING WITH THE LOCALS AND OUR

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:52.702
OTHER STATE PARTNERS AND I

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.037
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:55.805
THAT WE MAKE GOOD PROGRESS IS

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:58.375
BY COMBINING THOSE RESOURCES

00:52:58.441 --> 00:53:00.810
AND TO WORK TOGETHER. I THINK

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:03.213
ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS WE KEEP

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.348
IN MIND IS THAT COMBAT IN THE

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:07.584
LEGAL MARKET ISN'T SIMPLY JUST

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:09.352
TAKING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS I

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:10.987
THINK THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:12.389
TO HELP WITH THAT AND ONE IS TO

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:14.090
TRY TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:15.659
LEGAL MARKETS ACCESSIBLE TO

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:17.694
LICENSEES YOU KNOW A LOT OF

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:18.795
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DON'T ALLOW

00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:21.298
LEGAL CANNABIS MARKETS- AND

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.232
MAKING SURE THAT THE

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:23.366
PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:25.902
MARKET IS NOT COST PROHIBITIVE.

00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:27.604
AND ADDITIONALLY MAKING SURE

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:29.239
THAT REASONABLY PRICED CANNABIS

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:31.107
IS AVAILABLE TO OUR CONSUMERS

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:32.409
SO I THINK IF WE COUPLE THOSE

00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:34.578
ACTIVITIES AND THOSE POINTS OF

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:37.113
FOCUS ALONG WITH ENFORCEMENT WE

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:40.016
CAN MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON THE

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:42.152
ILLEGAL MARKET FRONTS THE BLACK

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:44.287
MARKET IS ALIVE AND THRIVING

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:45.488
AND IS ACTUALLY DOING VERY

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:47.657
WELL. AND EVEN ON INVESTIGATION

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:49.459
THOUGH SEVEN SIX INVESTIGATORS

00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:55.165
THERE BAY STATEWIDE. THEY'RE

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.132
NOT IN ONE LOCATION CORRECT.

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:58.134
THAT IS THE ARE NOT ALL IN ONE.

00:53:58.201 --> 00:53:59.035
CANNOT RETURN FLYING I MEAN

00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:00.770
YOU'RE REST OF YOUR FLY BACK OF

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:02.706
IN CALIFORNIA. SO THEY'RE STILL

00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:04.274
HEAVILY RELY UPON LOCAL

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.576
INVESTIGATORS DO THAT. EFFORT

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.645
FOR INVESTIGATION SURVEILLANCE

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:09.879
MANY DOZENS OF OFFICERS TO DO

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:13.750
THAT SO- AND I'M JUST YOU KNOW.

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:15.185
I KNOW YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT. IN

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:16.353
UP A SWORN OFFICER SO YOU DON'T

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:17.988
KNOW. BUT WHAT I'M TELLING YOU

00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:20.457
IS- THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT

00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:21.524
SIGNIFICANT OR NOT PUTTING A

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:22.926
DENT IN IT. AND WE SAY IT'S

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:24.561
ADEQUATE ONCE AGAIN THEY'RE

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:27.230
STILL VAPING GAS GOING ON SO

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.732
SILLIMANITE ASSUME THAT YOU'RE

00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:30.367
OKAY WITH THAT THAT. THERE'S

00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:32.135
ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT SILLIER

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:33.069
THEY'VE ADDRESSED THE VAPING

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:35.238
ISSUE FOR. BLACK MARKET VAPING

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:36.740
PRODUCTS AND THEY'RE NO MORE

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:40.844
DESK BEHIND. THAT IS THAT WHAT

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:42.646
HE'S SAYING. NOW WE'RE SIR.

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:45.115
OKAY WITH THE UP OBVIOUS. AND

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.716
WHERE DOING YOU KNOW IT WHEN

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.018
THOSE ITEMS COME TO OUR

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:49.319
ATTENTION WEEK WE WORK VERY

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:51.087
HARD TO IT TO COME ABOUT THOSE

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:52.555
AND DEAL WITH THOSE H. I THINK

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.758
WE HAD- THE VERTICAL BUT LESS

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:57.927
SITUATION WITHOUT THE LARGE-

00:54:57.994 --> 00:54:59.496
LICENSEE WHO. CONDUCTING

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:02.499
ILLEGAL IN THEM UNLICENSED

00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:04.034
ACTIVITY BOTH AS A LICENSEE AS

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.169
WELL AS- ENGAGING WITH

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:08.371
UNLICENSED FOLKS SO I THINK

00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:09.406
WHEN I SET UP BUT WE THINK THIS

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:10.340
IS THE APPROPRIATE STAFFING

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:11.841
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:12.609
CONTINUE TO BUILD THOSE

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:15.545
RESOURCES- AND THEN ONCE WE DO

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:17.747
I THINK WE CAN BETTER ASSESS IF

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.716
WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:20.483
WE'RE FILLING THESE NEW

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.718
POSITIONS THAT WE RECEIVED LAST

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.687
FISCAL YEAR. AND AS YOU KNOW IT

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:24.688
TAKES A WHILE TO GET GET

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:26.956
OFFICERS CAN BACKGROUND PROCESS

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:28.258
YEAH AND THEN ALSO SEEING HOW

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:31.594
THE CONSOLIDATION IMPACTS THOSE

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.029
ARE ABILITY IS THERE AND WE

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:34.931
THINK THAT WILL GIVE US- SOME

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.433
GREATER EFFICIENCIES AND THE

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:39.135
ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:40.837
WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:42.038
AS WELL AS OUR STATE LAW

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.940
ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:45.742
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE WORK

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:49.479
AGAINST THE BLACK MARKET. AND

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:50.580
WE TALKED ABOUT LAST. HOW RENT

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:53.349
THE BLACK. FOR WILL LA. YOU CAN

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:53.983
LOOK DOWN FOR MUCH ANY STREET

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:54.718
IN FOR BLACK MARKET VIEW

00:55:54.784 --> 00:55:57.587
BROUGHT. SO DO YOU ARE YOU TELL

ME RIGHT NOW THAT THAT HAS

00:55:58.955 --> 00:55:59.823
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY THAT IT'S

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:02.859
GONE DOWN- MUSCLES BUSINESSES

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:06.996
STILL. IN OPERATION. I DON'T

00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:08.298
HAVE THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW TO

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:09.966
ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESSES BUT I

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:10.967
KNOW THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.635
DO INVESTIGATIONS. AND WE ARE

00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:13.737
CERTAINLY SENSITIVE TO THE

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:14.838
ISSUES WITH BABY LAST YEAR HIM

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:16.072
QUITE CLOSE ATTENTION TO THAT

00:56:16.139 --> 00:56:16.940
WHEN THEY'RE BROUGHT TO OUR

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:18.475
ATTENTION AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:19.909
CONTINUE TO DO THAT UNDER THE

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:21.845
NEW DEPARTMENT. AND TALKING TO

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:24.380
LAW ENFORCEMENT GOALS GOALS-

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:26.516
VAPING SHOPS. THE LIST OF ONES

A BLACK MARKET ONES. ARE STILL

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:30.120
OPEN AND ARE STILL THRIVING.

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:31.821
BECAUSE THE ENFORCEMENT IS NOT

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:33.623
THERE WITH THEM. SO I'M I'M

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.091
GONNA START MY QUESTIONING

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:36.526

OVER TO YOU BUT IT THAT THAT'S

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.296
A BIG ISSUE LIKE I SAID- IF IT

00:56:40.363 --> 00:56:41.765
WASN'T FOR COVERT RIGHT NOW WE

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:43.166
WOULD HEAR A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.734
DYING. IN THE BLACK MARKET.

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.936
MARKET VAPING AND IT'S

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:49.139
FRUSTRATING. THAT YOU KNOW WE

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:50.573
WE'VE BEEN OVER BACKWARDS FOR

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.474
THE INDUSTRY TO GET HIM UP WE

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:53.777
HELP THEM OT. AND NOW IT'S

YOU THAT IT IS REALLY. CLEAR

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.858
THAT THE- THE BIGGEST THREAT TO

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.759
THE LEGAL MARKET RIGHT NOW IS.

00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:18.294
IS THE THRIVING ILLICIT MARKET

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:21.664
AND THE ILLICIT MARKET- IS A

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:22.498
THREAT UNDERCOVER WAYS AND WHEN

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:25.101
WE HAVE. OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:28.104

THE ONLY ONES GET THE FOCUS AND

00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:37.747
I THINK THAT THAT'S UNFORTUNATE

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:39.782
BECAUSE IT. IT'S SENDING AN

00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:42.452
UNINTENDED MESSAGE WHICH IS-

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.921

COMPLIANCE AND- I KNOW THAT'S

00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:51.094
NOT THE INTENTION BUT THAT IS

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:51.995
THE CONSEQUENCE AND THAT IS

00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:53.630
WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND WE NEED

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:55.531

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.300
I'M HOPING THAT- YOUR

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:59.102

GOOD PLAYERS WHO ARE FALLING

OUT EVERY DAY. AND THEY'RE

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:10.980
GIVING UP BECAUSE OF THE

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.282
DIFFICULTY THAT THEY'RE HAVING

00:59:12.348 --> 00:59:13.850

COMPETITORS HAVE NO RULES AND

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.555
UNLESS THE ONLY THING THEY WILL

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:20.556
RECOGNIZE AS BEING SHUT DOWN

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:22.225
WHEN YOU SAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:24.227
ONLY ONE YOU HAVE HESITATION OF

ENFORCEMENT. AND IT DOESN'T

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:31.301
MEAN SEND PEOPLE TO PRISON IT

THEIR MONEY THAT'S WHAT WILL

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.039
SHUT THEM DOWN. AND THAT TAKES

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.206
A COORDINATED EFFORT IT TAKES A

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:39.542
LOT OF WORK BUT IT MUST BE A

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:40.410

BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF A

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:28.644

CAN TELL YOU IN A PORSCHE

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.136
CAPACITY THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM.

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.537
AND IT'S VERY VERY REAL IN MY

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:30.905
DISTRICT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT-

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:32.140
MANY OTHER DISTRICTS BUT

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:33.708
THERE'S A VERY REAL PROBLEM.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.310
AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE BETTER

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.579
STEWARDS AND LISELOTTE IN THE

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:43.251

THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION COST

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.697
ME BE HIGHER BUT THERE'S NO

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.132
HARD DATA TO SUPPORT THAT THIS

01:23:57.198 --> 01:24:00.101
TIME IT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE SO

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:01.269
WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL- IT'S

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.470
IMPORTANT PURCHASE A LOT OF THE

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:04.038

CONTINUE TO DRIVE THOSE

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:38.660
VEHICLES AROUND. AND DON'T

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:39.527
REGISTER THEM CORRECT. I THAT

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:42.430

LIKELY TO HAPPEN OKAY. I DON'T

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:54.142
I'M NOT SURE. IF THERE'S A-

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:56.077

BECAUSE IN THE REPORT IS THAT.

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:03.685
THE PEOPLE CAN STILL CONTINUE

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:07.121
TO DRIVE THEIR CARS AROUND. SO

RETIRED VEHICLES THAT DOESN'T

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:38.786
MAKE SENSE TO REPAIR THE

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.254
VEHICLE AND THAT'S AN OPTION

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:44.692

FOR EXAMPLE AT THIS POINT AS

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:57.624
YOU HEARD IT'S A BIT UNCLEAR

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:59.559
PRECISELY HOW THE GRANT WOULD

01:50:12.172 --> 01:50:14.174
PROS AND CONS OF EACH APPROACH

AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL- IT'S MORE

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:19.779
LIKELY THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD

01:50:19.846 --> 01:50:22.682
BE- UNIFORM AND ITS-

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:24.517

WHERE IS IF IT WAS-

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:27.821
ADMINISTERED CLOSER TODAY

01:50:27.887 --> 01:50:29.489
COMMUNITIES THAT'S TARGETED

01:50:29.556 --> 01:50:31.324
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE LOCAL

01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:32.692
PARTNERS WOULD HAVE MORE

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:35.295
INSIGHT INTO THE COMMUNITIES

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:35.895
THAT THE ARTIST BEING TARGETED

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:37.797
AT. PROBLEM THERE'S ALSO A LOT

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:39.432
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PRECISELY

01:50:39.499 --> 01:50:40.800
HOW THE FORMS WOULD BE OUT

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:43.670
ALLOCATED SO- CDC INDICATES

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:45.005
THAT WE'RE GOING TO TARGET

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:46.773
COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.208
CODE NINETEEN INCLUDING

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:49.709
HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.478
COMMUNITIES. BUT THERE'S A FEW

01:50:51.544 --> 01:50:53.113
THINGS WE DON'T KNOW SUCH AS

01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:54.581
WHAT OTHER CRITERIA WILL BE

01:50:54.647 --> 01:50:55.982
CONSIDERED OR HOW THESE

01:50:56.049 --> 01:51:02.322
CRITERIA. WILL BE WEIGHED

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:02.956
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. WELL

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:04.057
THERE'S ALSO ABOUT HOW MANY

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:05.058
WILL BE REACHED. THE OUR

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.526
UNDERSTAND THAT OUR COUNCIL

01:51:06.593 --> 01:51:08.728
HOPING WORK WITH FIVE RD. AND

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:10.930
OKAY EIGHT. AT POINT IT'S WILL

01:51:10.997 --> 01:51:12.532
UNCLEAR AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:14.267
WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE ARTWORK

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:16.169
THAT WOULD BE. SUPPORTED THIS

01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:17.604
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE

01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:18.872
LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:20.607
COMPARE THE STRATEGY TO OTHER

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:22.208
STRATEGIES THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:23.376
MIGHT CONSIDER SUCH AS

01:51:23.443 --> 01:51:25.779
ADVERTISING. IT'S ALSO A BIT

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:27.247
UNCLEAR HOW THE MATCHING

01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:29.115
REQUIREMENT WOULD WORK. BOB

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:31.317
IT'S UNCLEAR SO BASICALLY WHO

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:32.485
WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:51:32.552 --> 01:51:34.521
IDENTIFYING THE MATCHING FUNDS

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:35.321
AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:51:35.388 --> 01:51:36.856
LEGISLATURE TO GET CLARITY ON

01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:38.358
THIS BECAUSE THE MATCHING

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:39.225
REQUIREMENT COULD

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:41.728
UNNECESSARILY. LIMIT THE TYPE

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:43.630
AND NUMBER OF ARTISTS WHO ARE

01:51:43.696 --> 01:51:45.899
ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE GRANTS-

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:47.000
AT THIS POINT WE WOULD

01:51:47.067 --> 01:51:48.601
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:50.303
WITHHOLD ACTION ON THE PROPOSAL

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.871
UNTIL WE CAN GET. MORE

01:51:51.938 --> 01:51:53.540
INFORMATION TO ANSWER THESE

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.241
QUESTIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:51:55.308 --> 01:51:56.643
THE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO GET

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:58.078
INFORMATION THAT SUGGESTS THAT

01:51:58.144 --> 01:51:59.279
THE PROGRAM WOULD BE EFFECTIVE

01:51:59.345 --> 01:52:03.883
HOWEVER. WE WOULD RECOMMEND

01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:04.951
APPROVING IT. HOWEVER OBVIOUSLY

01:52:05.018 --> 01:52:06.719
IF THE BUTTON FOR IS NOT. OR

01:52:06.786 --> 01:52:07.520
THERE'S QUESTION ABOUT THE- OF

01:52:07.587 --> 01:52:09.255
THE PROGRAM ONCE THE

01:52:09.322 --> 01:52:10.690
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED WE

01:52:10.757 --> 01:52:12.092
RECOMMEND ABOUT WHAT. THE

01:52:12.158 --> 01:52:14.694
LEGISLATURE LOOK FOR OTHER

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:16.596
ALTERNATIVES. WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:17.797
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:19.399
HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:21.701

BUILDING BASED ON PRE MED AND

02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:13.484
EXTENDERS THAT DESIGN IS NOT

02:33:13.551 --> 02:33:15.185
DONE THAT BASED ON THE- RECENT

02:33:15.252 --> 02:33:16.020
OBVIOUSLY WHAT THE BUILDINGS

02:33:16.086 --> 02:33:17.922
GOING TO FUNCTION. WE LOOK LIKE

02:33:17.988 --> 02:33:19.223

DID MENTION THOUGH OF COURSE

02:33:43.681 --> 02:33:44.515
THAT WE PICKED UP UNDERSTAND

02:33:44.582 --> 02:33:46.350
BUILDING- IN PART BECAUSE WE

02:33:46.417 --> 02:33:48.419
ARE. SPLITTING UP A LITTLE BIT

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:51.188
BUTALSO TO. BE LEAST COST

02:33:51.255 --> 02:33:53.223
IMPACTFUL MOVE FOR THEM AND

THE TREE TO- THERE WAS ONE L.

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:19.617
OF A LETTER THAT YOU DIDN'T

02:34:19.683 --> 02:34:20.951
TOUCH ON WHICH WERE THE BUDGET

02:34:21.018 --> 02:34:23.053
CONSIDERATIONS AND- WHAT-

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:24.622
TREASURE MOD LAYS OUT UNDER

02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:27.191
LETTER WAS SENT ORIGINALLY- THE

02:34:27.257 --> 02:34:28.525
BUDGET FOR THIS BUILDING WAS

02:34:28.592 --> 02:34:30.194
NINETY MILLION THAT INCREASED

02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:32.029
43% TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:34.398
MILLION. ORIGINALLY WAS SEVEN

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:35.532
HUNDRED FIFTY PER SQUARE FOOT

02:34:35.599 --> 02:34:36.900
NOW IT'S OVER A THOUSAND

02:34:36.967 --> 02:34:38.035
DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT AND

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:39.336
WHAT SHE HIGHLIGHTS IS DURING

02:34:39.403 --> 02:34:40.804
THIS TIME GIVEN THE ECONOMIC

02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:43.073
IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. MANY

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:44.541
PEOPLE ARE FACING UNPRECEDENTED

02:34:44.608 --> 02:34:46.377
DISRUPTIONS TO THEIR LIVES

02:34:46.443 --> 02:34:47.745
INCLUDING STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE

02:34:47.811 --> 02:34:49.713
BEEN SUBJECT TO PAY CUTS EXCEPT

02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:51.849
TRUCK TO PROCEED WHICH SUCH A

02:34:51.915 --> 02:34:52.816
LARGE SCALE EXPENSIVE

02:34:52.883 --> 02:34:56.286
RNOVATION PROJECT- MAY CAUSE

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:57.321
INDIVIDUALS TO QUESTION OUR

02:34:57.388 --> 02:34:59.123
STATE'S PRIORITIES DURING THIS

02:34:59.189 --> 02:35:01.392
UNCERTAIN FISCAL TIME COULD YOU

02:35:01.458 --> 02:35:03.794
ADDRESS THAT- I HAVE TO ADMIT I

02:35:03.861 --> 02:35:05.763
READ THAT IT. JUMPED OUT AT ME-

02:35:05.829 --> 02:35:09.933
AND I'D. BE CURIOUS TO KNOW

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:10.501
WHAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS ON

02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:11.268
THAT. YEAH ABSOLUTELY- SO COME

02:35:11.335 --> 02:35:12.936
POINTS IN RESPONSE- AND ALL

02:35:13.003 --> 02:35:14.738
THIS BE COMMUNICATED TO THE

02:35:14.805 --> 02:35:16.607
TREASURES WHILE- PERSON

02:35:16.674 --> 02:35:18.709
FOREMOST- SHE IS RIGHT ABOUT

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:21.078
THE PERCENTAGE CLIMBS- OF THE

02:35:21.145 --> 02:35:22.246
PROJECT I CAN EXPLAIN THAT A

02:35:22.312 --> 02:35:24.715
SECOND- WE DID POINT OUT. THAT

02:35:24.782 --> 02:35:25.983
THERE'S A REASON WHY YOU DON'T

02:35:26.050 --> 02:35:28.719
USE. THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE AS THE

02:35:28.786 --> 02:35:31.422
COST BASIS- GENERALLY FOR

02:35:31.488 --> 02:35:32.189
RENOVATIONS NEW CONSTRUCTION

02:35:32.256 --> 02:35:34.258
USE GROSS- BECAUSE IT JUST

02:35:34.324 --> 02:35:35.959
LOOKS LIKE THAT YOUR FLIGHT THE

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:37.327
COST OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE SAID

02:35:37.394 --> 02:35:39.430
THAT- TO THE COSTS ARE ACTUALLY

02:35:39.496 --> 02:35:40.597
LOWER THAN STATED. ON A SQUARE

02:35:40.664 --> 02:35:42.066
FOOTAGE BASIS BUT THE COSTS

02:35:42.132 --> 02:35:43.634
HAVE INCREASED AND THE

02:35:43.701 --> 02:35:45.669
PERCENTAGES ARE ABOUT RIGHT-

02:35:45.736 --> 02:35:46.737
THERE A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR

02:35:46.804 --> 02:35:49.773
THAT- FIRST AND FOREMOST-

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:51.675
CONTEST CONDITIONS SO- THE

02:35:51.742 --> 02:35:54.378
PROJECTS IN IN THE LATE- ONE

02:35:54.445 --> 02:35:56.346
YEAR. HAVE GONE UP THE DIRECT

02:35:56.413 --> 02:35:58.816
COST OF GOING UP 5% PLUS- ON

02:35:58.882 --> 02:36:01.118
THE BASIS. INDIRECT COSTS THAT

02:36:01.185 --> 02:36:02.920
GO ALONG WITH IT- AND SO YOU

02:36:02.986 --> 02:36:04.688
END UP HAVING DESIGN FEES WHICH

02:36:04.755 --> 02:36:07.024
ARE PERCENTAGE- YOUR PRODUCT.

02:36:07.091 --> 02:36:08.192
TO CONTINUE TO SEE WHICH IS THE

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:14.098
PERCENTAGE. INSPECTION WHICH-

02:36:14.164 --> 02:36:15.599
SO THE DIRECT COSTS OF GOING SO

02:36:15.666 --> 02:36:18.969
HOW THOSE FEES. WITH OTHER-

02:36:19.036 --> 02:36:20.904
COUPLE OF A GENERAL. IN TERMS

02:36:20.971 --> 02:36:22.873
OF PRICE COSTS IN. EIGHT NINETY

02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:23.841
THE PROJECT FOR WAS FIRST PUT

02:36:23.907 --> 02:36:27.177
FORWARD- THEY WERE BASED ON OF-

02:36:27.244 --> 02:36:27.845
INFRASTRUCTURE STUDIES WERE EXT.

02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:31.081
THE TIME- WE ALSO USED LIBRARY

02:36:31.148 --> 02:36:33.717
COURTS AN- PROJECT WHICH IS

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:34.618
ACROSS THE STREET FROM PINE

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:37.287
RIVER AS A COST BASIS FOR TWO

02:36:37.354 --> 02:36:39.823
OF THEM- BACK. TO BE A MISTAKE

02:36:39.890 --> 02:36:41.625
HE- LIBRARY COURTS ANNEX

02:36:41.692 --> 02:36:43.026
ACTUALLY PROVED TO BE A PARTIAL

02:36:43.093 --> 02:36:44.428
RENOVATION WHICH WE DID NOT

02:36:44.495 --> 02:36:46.864
REALIZE- AND SO WHEN YOU ALIGN

02:36:46.930 --> 02:36:48.332
THE SCOPE. OF THE LIBRARY

02:36:48.398 --> 02:36:50.234
COURTS RENOVATION TO WHAT WE

02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:51.602
HAVE TO DO THESE BUILDINGS

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:53.504
BECAUSE ACTUALLY MATERIAL HE-

02:36:53.570 --> 02:36:54.872
MATCHED THE PROBLEM IS OF

02:36:54.938 --> 02:36:56.473
COURSE IS THAT WE JUST PICK THE

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:57.741
COR ANALOG BEGIN WITH.

02:36:57.808 --> 02:36:59.510
UNDERESTIMATED THE COSTS THE

02:36:59.576 --> 02:37:01.678
SECOND PLEASE- THAT WAS AS WE

02:37:01.745 --> 02:37:03.947
GOT THE FUNDING LEGISLATURE IN

02:37:04.014 --> 02:37:05.048
EIGHTEEN NINETY BEGIN TO DO.

02:37:05.115 --> 02:37:06.450
MORE UPDATED- BUILDING

02:37:06.517 --> 02:37:08.185
INVESTIGATIONS- WHAT WE

02:37:08.252 --> 02:37:09.620
GENERALLY FOUND WORK CONDITIONS

02:37:09.686 --> 02:37:12.256
THAT HAD- XCELERATED LEE GOTTEN

02:37:12.322 --> 02:37:14.324
WORSE- AND NEW BUILDING

02:37:14.391 --> 02:37:16.460
CONDITIONS THAT EXIST FOR. A

02:37:16.527 --> 02:37:18.529
REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE I THINK

02:37:18.595 --> 02:37:22.065
IS- THE- THE RESOURCES BUILDING

02:37:22.132 --> 02:37:25.035
SO WE KNEW THE BUILDING HAD A

02:37:25.102 --> 02:37:26.970
SEISMIC ISSUE WE HAD IT. FOR

02:37:27.037 --> 02:37:28.572
BUT DIGGING INTO SOME OF THE

02:37:28.639 --> 02:37:30.507
SPECIFICS AND THE EXTENT OF IT-

02:37:30.574 --> 02:37:32.509
WE FOUND WE HAVE TO. REMOVE THE

02:37:32.576 --> 02:37:34.478
ENTIRE EXTERIOR CLADDING OF THE

02:37:34.545 --> 02:37:37.114
BUILDING- AS WELL AS CHORE UP

02:37:37.181 --> 02:37:38.582
THE ENTIRE INTERIOR STRUCTURAL

02:37:38.649 --> 02:37:40.317
SYSTEM IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

02:37:40.384 --> 02:37:43.153
SEISMIC ISSUE- SOME OF THOSE IT

02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:50.427
WORSENING CONDITIONS. HAVE

02:37:50.494 --> 02:37:50.994
DRIVEN UP THE COSTS OF. IF I

02:37:51.061 --> 02:37:52.429
COULD I UNDERSTAND NOW WHY THE

02:37:52.496 --> 02:37:53.063
IS GOING UP MY REAL QUESTION IS

02:37:53.130 --> 02:37:53.730
NOW THE RIGHT TIME FOR US SPEND

02:37:53.797 --> 02:37:55.465
ON TWENTY MY- DOLLARS. ON THIS

02:37:55.532 --> 02:37:56.567
WEEK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT

02:37:56.633 --> 02:37:57.968
THIS IS THAT'S REALLY WHAT ARE.

02:37:58.035 --> 02:37:58.535
THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ARE

02:37:58.602 --> 02:38:01.638
GONNA BE ASKING US. AND I WOULD

02:38:01.705 --> 02:38:03.507
I WOULD MAKE THE- THAT THAT YES-

02:38:03.574 --> 02:38:05.843
THESE PROJECTS- COMBINED WILL

02:38:05.909 --> 02:38:08.111
ADD A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT INTO

02:38:08.178 --> 02:38:09.780
THE LOCAL ECONOMY- THE UNDER

02:38:09.847 --> 02:38:11.048
PROJECT A LOCAL CREATE

02:38:11.114 --> 02:38:12.816
SOMEWHERE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE

02:38:12.883 --> 02:38:13.917
HUNDRED JOBS PER YEAR DIRECTLY

02:51:40.857 --> 02:51:44.227
PRIVATE SECTOR- BOTH. YOU KNOW

02:51:44.293 --> 02:51:45.061
FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT-

02:51:45.128 --> 02:51:46.396
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN THE

02:51:46.462 --> 02:51:47.864
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 30% OF

02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:49.632
WHICH I'D NEVER DONE STATE.

02:51:49.699 --> 02:51:52.669
WORK BEFORE- SURVEYED STAFF

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:54.137
THERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF

02:51:54.203 --> 02:51:55.171
DELIVERING SERVICES TO THE

02:51:55.238 --> 02:51:56.873
PUBLIC AS WELL AS OUR A. I. O.

02:51:56.939 --> 02:51:58.675
IN CIO COMMUNITY IN THE

02:51:58.741 --> 02:51:59.308
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO

02:51:59.375 --> 02:52:01.244
UNDERSTAND. SOME OF THE PAIN

02:52:01.310 --> 02:52:03.079
POINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES. WE

02:52:03.146 --> 02:52:04.213
REPEATED A BUNCH OF THE CASE

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:06.249
HISTORY- BOTH ABOUT WHAT FOLKS

02:52:06.315 --> 02:52:08.184
HAVE DONE WELL IN OTHER PLACES.

02:52:08.251 --> 02:52:10.019
AS WELL AS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

02:52:10.086 --> 02:52:11.721
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:52:11.788 --> 02:52:13.589
AND THEN RAN INTO A CROSS US OF

02:52:13.656 --> 02:52:14.924
BUILDING OUT THE PLAN ITSELF

02:52:14.991 --> 02:52:16.392
INCLUDING GATHERING SOME

02:52:16.459 --> 02:52:18.161
FEEDBACK FROM. STAFF OF THIS

02:52:18.227 --> 02:52:22.365
COMMITTEE AS. WELL AS THE L. A.

02:52:22.432 --> 02:52:22.932
L. AS WE WERE FINALIZED. SO

02:52:22.999 --> 02:52:24.367
COUPLE THINGS THAT WE LEARN.

02:52:24.434 --> 02:52:25.735
FROM ONE OF THAT KOBE SHOWN

02:52:25.802 --> 02:52:27.203
THAT WE PAY PER. IN AND REALLY

02:52:27.270 --> 02:52:30.640
TAKE- DIRECTOR TELLING MYSELF

02:52:30.707 --> 02:52:36.179
FOR. SPONSORED MAXINE'S BUT

02:52:36.245 --> 02:52:38.014
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH WE

02:52:38.081 --> 02:52:39.182
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

02:52:39.248 --> 02:52:40.917
GETTING AHEAD OF PROBLEMS- THAT

02:52:40.983 --> 02:52:42.251
WE'RE SOLVING PROBLEMS TOGETHER

02:52:42.318 --> 02:52:43.152
WITH THE RIGHT FOLKS IN THE

02:52:43.219 --> 02:52:45.655
ROOM- AND MAKING SURE THAT

02:52:45.722 --> 02:52:46.255
WE'VE GOT. EASIER AND FASTER

02:52:46.322 --> 02:52:48.024
WAYS TO GET STARTED. AND SO

02:52:48.091 --> 02:52:50.093
WITH THAT IN MIND- WE PUT OUT

02:52:50.159 --> 02:52:51.961
THREE GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO

02:52:52.028 --> 02:52:52.495
GUIDE THE WAY THAT WE USE

02:52:52.562 --> 02:52:54.564
TECHNOLOGY IN THE STATE- WHICH

02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:55.798
ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE A

02:52:55.865 --> 02:52:56.933
TREMENDOUS SURPRISE THE FIRST

02:52:56.999 --> 02:52:58.701
IS. PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST SO WE

02:52:58.768 --> 02:52:59.535
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:52:59.602 --> 02:53:01.437
PUTTING BOTH THE RESIDENTS IN

02:53:01.504 --> 02:53:02.839
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS

02:53:02.905 --> 02:53:04.507
WELL AS THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON

02:53:04.574 --> 02:53:05.141
THE FRONT LINES OF DELIVERING

02:53:05.208 --> 02:53:06.476
SERVICES TO. THE PEOPLE OF

02:53:06.542 --> 02:53:08.344
CALIFORNIA FIRST AS WE ARE

02:53:08.411 --> 02:53:10.079
MAKING TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS.

02:53:10.146 --> 02:53:11.447
SECOND IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:12.148
THEY WERE MAKING CONTINUOUS

02:53:12.215 --> 02:53:13.549
TIMELY IMPROVEMENTS SO IT'S NOT

02:53:13.616 --> 02:53:14.383
ENOUGH THAT WE'RE JUST GETTING

02:53:14.450 --> 02:53:16.018
BETTER. WE NEED TO GET BTTER

02:53:16.085 --> 02:53:17.053
SO THAT WE ARE DELIVERING THE

02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:18.521
SERVICE THAT IS NEEDED AT THE

02:53:18.588 --> 02:53:20.523
TIME THAT I JUST NEEDED TO- AND

02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:21.724
THE THIRD IS WORKING TOGETHER

02:53:21.791 --> 02:53:22.825
IT'S WORKING ALONE AND SO WE'VE

02:53:22.892 --> 02:53:24.360
SEEN THIS A LOT IN THE CONTEXT

02:53:24.427 --> 02:53:26.129
OF THE PANDEMIC- EVEN OUTSIDE.

02:53:26.195 --> 02:53:27.697
AND DEMOCRATS TAXED WHERE WE

02:53:27.764 --> 02:53:29.132
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PUTTING

02:53:29.198 --> 02:53:29.866
THE RIGHT FOLKS AROUND THE

02:53:29.932 --> 02:53:30.800
TABLE TO SOLVE COMMON

02:53:30.867 --> 02:53:31.801
CHALLENGES THAT'S CRITICALLY

02:53:31.868 --> 02:53:33.569
IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE

02:53:33.636 --> 02:53:35.304
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAVE

02:53:35.371 --> 02:53:37.373
POLICY AND OPERATIONS. TOGETHER

02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:39.108
WITH TECHNOLOGY IN THE DATA AS

02:53:39.175 --> 02:53:41.210
WE ARE DECIDING. HOW TO BUILD

02:53:41.277 --> 02:53:42.411
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO

02:53:42.478 --> 02:53:44.480
SUPPORT A PARTICULAR SERVICE.

02:53:44.547 --> 02:53:46.382
AND THREE ARTICULATED FIVE

02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:48.785
FIVE. GOALS ON THAT WERE

02:53:48.851 --> 02:53:50.052
DRIVING TOWARDS MUSIC THESE

02:53:50.119 --> 02:53:51.721
ARE. TIMELESS GOALS. THE FIRST

02:53:51.788 --> 02:53:52.622
IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

02:53:52.688 --> 02:53:54.257
DELIVERING EASY TO USE FAST

02:53:54.323 --> 02:53:55.691
DEPENDABLE AND SECURE PUBLIC

02:53:55.758 --> 02:53:57.927
SERVICES. AND SO YOU KNOW IF

02:53:57.994 --> 02:53:58.895
YOU COULD TALK TO ME TWO YEARS

02:53:58.961 --> 02:54:00.229
AGO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC I MIGHT

02:54:00.296 --> 02:54:01.731
TO FOCUS MORE ON THE EASY TO

02:54:01.798 --> 02:54:04.400
USE AND FAST- AND I THINK.

02:54:04.467 --> 02:54:07.670
QUITE CLEARLY IN THE LAST. YEAR

02:54:07.737 --> 02:54:09.739
DEPENDABLE AND SECURE HAS BEEN-

02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:11.974
AN INCREASING FOCUS. AND YOU

02:54:12.041 --> 02:54:12.975
KNOW HONESTLY WE'VE DONE A LOT

02:54:13.042 --> 02:54:14.544
OF REACTION AND THAT'S CRITICAL

02:54:14.610 --> 02:54:15.378
IT'S CRITICAL THAT WHEN

02:54:15.444 --> 02:54:16.546
SOMETHING FAILS OR WHEN

02:54:16.612 --> 02:54:18.581
SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN WE GO

02:54:18.648 --> 02:54:19.849
AND WE FIX THINGS. BUT AS

02:54:19.916 --> 02:54:21.350
DIRECTOR TOM MENTIONED EARLIER

02:54:21.417 --> 02:54:22.785
WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:54:22.852 --> 02:54:24.187
WE ARE WE'RE GETTING AHEAD OF

02:54:24.253 --> 02:54:25.454
THAT MORE PREVENTING ISSUES

02:54:25.521 --> 02:54:27.056
BEFORE THEY BECOME FIRES THAT

02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:28.291
WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN REAL

02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:30.560
TIME. AND SO WITH THAT THAT'S

02:54:30.626 --> 02:54:31.761
YOUR VERY MUCH SEARCHING OUT

02:54:31.828 --> 02:54:37.934
THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. AROUND

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:38.568
TAKING PREVENTIVE ACTION AROUND

02:54:38.634 --> 02:54:39.135
THE BOOKS CRITICAL SERVICES

02:54:39.202 --> 02:54:41.237
THAT THE STATE PROVIDES. ON THE

02:54:41.304 --> 02:54:42.438
SECOND GOAL IS AROUND MAKING

02:54:42.505 --> 02:54:43.072
SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC ARE EQUITY

02:54:43.139 --> 02:54:44.640
INCLUDE. I'M IN THE I LIKE TO

02:54:44.707 --> 02:54:48.110
USE HERE- ACTUALLY IN THAT-

02:54:48.177 --> 02:54:50.713
KRISTIN GRIFFIN ACT US A QUOTE

02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:52.915
WE WERE WRITING TO THIS REPORT-

02:54:52.982 --> 02:54:54.517
WHERE SAID IF IT SOUNDS

02:54:54.584 --> 02:54:56.152
SOMETIMES LIKE WE ARE DESIGNING

02:54:56.219 --> 02:54:58.187
SERVICES FOR A YOU KNOW AN

02:54:58.254 --> 02:55:00.223
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS WHITE PERSON

02:55:00.289 --> 02:55:01.791
WITH A POSTGRADUATE DEGREE- AND

02:55:01.858 --> 02:55:03.159
THE REALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW

02:55:03.226 --> 02:55:04.393
GOVERNMENT HAS A CRITICAL ROLE

02:55:04.460 --> 02:55:06.329
TO PLAY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS

02:55:06.395 --> 02:55:07.797
AND SO WE NEED TO AND FOR THAT

02:55:07.864 --> 02:55:10.066
THINGS LIKE A READABILITY- ARE

02:55:10.132 --> 02:55:11.534
NOT A POSTGRADUATE LEVEL WHICH

02:55:11.601 --> 02:55:12.635
MANY OF OUR WEBSITES AND

02:55:12.702 --> 02:55:14.303
SERVICES ARE. AND WE NEED TO DO

02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:16.005
THE HARD WORK OF SIMPLIFYING

02:55:16.072 --> 02:55:17.506
AND DRIVE AND ACCESSIBILITY NOT

02:55:17.573 --> 02:55:19.208
JUST IN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE BUT

02:55:19.275 --> 02:55:22.645
IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL

02:55:22.712 --> 02:55:23.246
EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE.

02:55:23.312 --> 02:55:25.514
THE THIRD- BIG GO IS ROW MAKING.

02:55:25.581 --> 02:55:27.550
TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS USE AND

02:55:27.617 --> 02:55:28.951
SHARE AND REUSE ACROSS

02:55:29.018 --> 02:55:30.586
GOVERNMENT. AN EXAMPLE I LIKE

02:55:30.653 --> 02:55:32.188
TEACHERS HERE- IS AROUND

02:55:32.255 --> 02:55:34.156
DIGITAL IDENTIFICATION- TO

02:55:34.223 --> 02:55:35.758
RIGHT NOW. IDENTIFICATION IS A

02:55:35.825 --> 02:55:37.627
PROBLEM THAT WE SOLVE DOZENS OF

02:55:37.693 --> 02:55:39.028
TIMES ACROSS THE STATE OF

02:55:39.095 --> 02:55:40.363
CALIFORNIA. AND IF YOU THINK

02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:43.532
ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF A

02:55:43.599 --> 02:55:44.533
INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIAN TRYING

02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:45.902
TO. SOMETHING FROM THEIR

02:55:45.968 --> 02:55:47.270
GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

02:55:47.336 --> 02:55:48.971
DIFFERENT LOGGINS FOR DIFFERENT

02:55:49.038 --> 02:55:50.239
SERVICES SOMETIMES EVEN WITHIN

02:55:50.306 --> 02:55:52.708
THE SAME DEPARTMENTS. AND SO

02:55:52.775 --> 02:55:53.609
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY ABOUT

02:55:53.676 --> 02:55:54.644
SAYING OKA RATHER THAN

02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:56.712
FIGURING OUT THE YOU KNOW

02:55:56.779 --> 02:55:57.947
TRYING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IN

02:55:58.014 --> 02:55:59.181
A DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT OR

02:55:59.248 --> 02:56:00.983
PROGRAM BY PROGRAM BASIS ONE OF

02:56:01.050 --> 02:56:01.751
THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN

02:56:01.817 --> 02:56:03.152
ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THE SCALE OF

02:56:03.219 --> 02:56:03.920
THE STATE AND SOLVE THAT

02:56:03.986 --> 02:56:05.655
PROBLEM FEDERATED WAY. SO WE'RE

02:56:05.721 --> 02:56:07.490
NOT SAYING HEY THERE'S ONE FOR

02:56:07.556 --> 02:56:09.025
ONE SORT OF SOLUTION THAT FITS

02:56:09.091 --> 02:56:10.192
ALL CASES BUT WE'RE AT LEAST

02:56:10.259 --> 02:56:11.427
FEDERATING AND MAKING SURE THAT

02:56:11.494 --> 02:56:12.862
THESE THINGS WORK TOGETHER TO

02:56:12.929 --> 02:56:14.597
IMPROVE USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVE

02:56:14.664 --> 02:56:16.732
OUR USE. OF THE TAXPAYERS

02:56:16.799 --> 02:56:19.368
RESOURCES. THE FOURTH GOAL IS

02:56:19.435 --> 02:56:20.569
AROUND BUILDING DIGITAL

02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:21.570
GOVERNMENT MORE QUICKLY MORE

02:56:21.637 --> 02:56:23.372
EFFECTIVELY AND SERVICE THESE

02:56:23.439 --> 02:56:24.840
ARE THINGS LIKE WE PUT A LOT

02:56:24.907 --> 02:56:26.442
ABOUT WRITTEN REPLACE PROJECTS

02:56:26.509 --> 02:56:28.077
OVER THE YEARS. I'M ONE OF THE

02:56:28.144 --> 02:56:29.211
THINGS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:56:29.278 --> 02:56:30.179
THAT WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:31.514
ISN'T MODERNIZING LEGACY

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:33.282
INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT REPLACE

02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:35.451
SO THINKING ABOUT. SORT OF NEW

02:56:35.518 --> 02:56:36.953
NOVEL PATTERSON CASE HISTORIES

02:56:37.019 --> 02:56:38.187
ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE THINGS

02:56:38.254 --> 02:56:39.488
LIKE THE STRANGLER PATTERN TO

02:56:39.555 --> 02:56:41.424
BE ABLE TO SLOWLY TRANSITION

02:56:41.490 --> 02:56:43.225
AWAY. UP TO ENABLE MORE

02:56:43.292 --> 02:56:45.594
ITERATIVE PROGRESS. AND LAST

02:56:45.661 --> 02:56:47.363
BUT NOT LEAST- BUILDING

02:56:47.430 --> 02:56:48.531
CONFIDENT EMPOWERED MULTI

02:56:48.597 --> 02:56:50.433
DISCIPLINARY TEAMS AND SO WE

02:56:50.499 --> 02:56:51.033
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:56:56.138 --> 02:56:56.939
LEADERSHIP LEVEL SO THAT WE

THAT- THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS

02:58:33.302 --> 02:58:35.171
INCREDIBLY DECENTRALIZED MANY

02:58:35.237 --> 02:58:37.807
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE MAKING

02:58:37.873 --> 02:58:39.175
INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS. WHERE

02:58:39.241 --> 02:58:41.877
SITE AND IT APPEARS TO ME THAT

DEPARTMENT INVOLVED IN DECISION

02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:09.138
MAKING ON IT PROJECTS WHEN YOU

02:59:09.205 --> 02:59:11.841
LOOKED AND- I SEE FROM THE

02:59:11.907 --> 02:59:13.809
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE HAVE. AT

AFTER THE FACT. IN PART BECAUSE

02:59:38.067 --> 02:59:39.168
I'M CONCERNED YOUR DEPARTMENT

02:59:39.235 --> 02:59:41.804
ISN'T SITUATED TO AGAIN BE

02:59:41.871 --> 02:59:43.906
PROACTIVE AND TRY TO CENTRALIZE

02:59:43.973 --> 02:59:46.575
THE JUST NOT AS SOMEONE IF YOU

02:59:46.642 --> 02:59:48.844

TRACK RECORD IN THE STATE IS

02:59:57.753 --> 03:00:00.122
NOT SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW

03:00:00.189 --> 03:00:01.857
FRANKLY I MYSELF FOR PRODUCTS.

03:00:01.924 --> 03:00:03.325
BUT ONE THING THAT I WANT TO

03:00:03.392 --> 03:00:05.027
CLARIFY SPECIFIC ABOUT THE ROLE

03:00:05.094 --> 03:00:06.362

03:00:06.428 --> 03:00:09.098
TECHNOLOGY. IS NOT JUST LIKE

YOU DESCRIBE WE ARE IN MANY

03:00:10.432 --> 03:00:13.469
TIMES ARE- OPERATING ONE YOUR

03:00:13.536 --> 03:00:15.771
DOCTOR. IT IS BECAUSE THE FACT

03:00:15.838 --> 03:00:17.806
THAT ON THE DAY TO DAY BASIS.

03:00:17.873 --> 03:00:19.041
EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND

03:00:19.108 --> 03:00:20.609
THEY'RE HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS

03:00:20.676 --> 03:00:22.645
STATE ENTITIES EACH ONE OF THEM

03:00:22.711 --> 03:00:24.246
HAVE THEIR OWN I. T. SHOP IN

03:00:24.313 --> 03:00:26.148
EACH ONE OF THEM HAVE THEIR- I.

03:00:26.215 --> 03:00:29.652

03:00:29.718 --> 03:00:31.620
PROJECT INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

03:00:31.687 --> 03:00:33.422
WITH THE EXCEPTION THE NES

03:00:33.489 --> 03:00:34.590
THAT ARE OVER A CERTAIN

03:00:34.657 --> 03:00:36.492
THRESHOLD WHICH IS WHAT YOU SEE

03:00:36.559 --> 03:00:38.027
IN THE OVERALL IT PROJECT

03:00:38.093 --> 03:00:39.862
TRACKING LIST. THAT WENT IN

03:00:39.929 --> 03:00:41.030
ONLY WHEN DEPARTMENT OF

03:00:41.096 --> 03:00:42.965
TECHNOLOGY- SIDES OVER

03:00:43.032 --> 03:00:49.505
OVERSIGHT. RESPONSIBILITY.

03:00:49.572 --> 03:00:51.106
HAVING THAT. I THINK THE-

03:00:51.173 --> 03:00:52.775
DESCRIPTION ON THIS TECHNOLOGY.

03:00:52.841 --> 03:00:54.710
IT'S A VERY BALLOT ONE. AND WE

03:00:54.777 --> 03:00:56.879
KNOW IT'S- THE STATE NH.

03:00:56.946 --> 03:00:58.714
DECENTRALIZED MODEL IN MANY

03:00:58.781 --> 03:01:01.717
CASES. IT MIGHT BE- YOU KNOW

03:01:01.784 --> 03:01:03.586
WARRANTED THE SOME POINT NOT

03:01:03.652 --> 03:01:04.553
THINKING HEY THE DEPARTMENT

03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:05.721
HAVE A LOT OF FREEDOM TO DO

03:01:05.788 --> 03:01:07.690
CERTAIN THINGS. BUT ACTUALLY

03:01:07.756 --> 03:01:08.891
WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING THE

03:01:08.958 --> 03:01:11.293
PROBLEM. IN MORE THAN ONCE

03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:12.294
ESPECIALLY DEPARTMENT OF

03:01:12.361 --> 03:01:14.330
SIMILAR PROBLEMS. FOR CATCHING

03:01:14.396 --> 03:01:15.931
PROBLEM YOU KNOW IN IN A

03:01:15.998 --> 03:01:17.633
PROACTIVE MANNER RATHER THAN

03:01:17.700 --> 03:01:18.968
WAITING UNTIL SOMETHING BLOWS

03:01:19.034 --> 03:01:21.103
UP AND WE GET SENT IN AS THE AS

03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:22.805
THE OUR DOCTOR TO ADDRESS IT.

03:01:22.871 --> 03:01:24.573
IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE MODEL.

03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:27.243
SO INTO TO ADDRESS STOCK. THE

03:01:27.309 --> 03:01:31.747
BUDGET ADDRESS THAT WERE ASKING.

03:01:31.814 --> 03:01:32.915
RIGHT NOW THE- STABILITY. NOT

03:01:32.982 --> 03:01:34.750
QUITE STRUCTURE AND PRIDE. IT

03:01:34.817 --> 03:01:38.053
IS IN THE- TO CORRAL OUT OF A-

03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:39.521
APPROACH AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO

03:01:39.588 --> 03:01:41.824
SAY HEY LOOK LET'S NOT YOU KNOW

03:01:41.890 --> 03:01:43.492
CONTINUE TO BE IN THIS REACTIVE

03:01:43.559 --> 03:01:45.060
MODE YOU WE HAVE MORE

03:01:45.127 --> 03:01:48.931
VISIBILITY TO IT NOT ONLY- THAT

03:01:48.998 --> 03:01:50.766
WE CAN BE MORE PROACTIVE TO IT.

03:01:50.833 --> 03:01:52.067
BUT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE

03:01:52.134 --> 03:01:53.769
MORE VISIBILITY TO THE DATABASE

03:01:53.836 --> 03:01:55.471
EXPENDITURE IN THE DECISION

03:01:55.537 --> 03:01:57.039
MAKING IT MORE COMPETITIVE WITH

03:01:57.106 --> 03:01:59.408
THE DEPARTMENT WE CAN BE MORE

03:01:59.475 --> 03:02:01.143
INTO WHAT I CALL THE PREVENTIVE

03:02:01.210 --> 03:02:02.411
CARE AS OPPOSED TO EMERGENCY

03:02:02.478 --> 03:02:04.680
RESPONSE OF CARE INTRO THE HELP

03:02:04.747 --> 03:02:08.183
OF THE I. T. INVESTMENT AT THE

03:02:08.250 --> 03:02:08.984
PARTICULAR PROGRAM. AND THAT IS

03:02:09.051 --> 03:02:12.821
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY MUCH.

03:02:12.888 --> 03:02:14.390
YOU'RE NOT OPEN TO. AND

03:02:14.456 --> 03:02:15.624
INVOLVEMENT IN THE LEGISLATURE

03:02:15.691 --> 03:02:18.127
AS YOU SEE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND

03:02:18.193 --> 03:02:18.994
YOU HAVE THE OVERSIGHT ROLE YOU

03:02:19.061 --> 03:02:20.963
KNOW OVER EXECUTIVE BRANCH AS

03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:22.231
WELL AND I KNOW THIS IS

03:02:22.298 --> 03:02:23.499
SOMETHING THAT IS ON THE TOP OF

03:02:23.565 --> 03:02:25.334
MIND FOR YOU ALL AND WE'RE VERY

03:02:25.401 --> 03:02:26.935

CORRECT THIS CULTURE OF

03:02:32.074 --> 03:02:34.243
REACTION. TO PREVENTION. AND I

03:02:34.310 --> 03:02:34.710
DON'T WANNA MAKE CLEAR

03:02:34.777 --> 03:02:36.211
PARTICULARLY TO OUR COLLEAGUES

03:02:36.278 --> 03:02:37.479
ON THIS COMMITTEE- WHO HAVE

03:02:37.546 --> 03:02:39.381
HEARD. OVER THE YEARS RAIL

03:02:39.448 --> 03:02:41.617
AGAINST DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:43.252
HAVE MISMANAGING I THINK MISS

03:02:43.319 --> 03:02:44.753
HANDLE DIFFERENT I. T. BUDGETS.

03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:46.588

REQUEST I ACTUALLY THINK. THE

03:02:50.092 --> 03:02:51.593
STATE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF

03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:52.828
WE DID A BETTER JOB OF

03:02:52.895 --> 03:02:56.632
CENTRALIZING- DIED DIED. THE

03:02:56.699 --> 03:02:59.168
THOUGHT PROCESS THE STRATEGY

03:02:59.234 --> 03:03:00.736
BUDGET OVERSIGHT WITHIN YOUR

BROUGHT IN. WHEN SOMETHING HAS

03:03:08.644 --> 03:03:10.746
BLOWN UP. AND WE NEED TO GET

03:03:10.813 --> 03:03:13.349
YOUR EXPERTISE AND EARLIER- I

03:03:13.415 --> 03:03:15.384
WAS REALLY STRUCK IN THE VISION

03:03:15.451 --> 03:03:16.018
TWENTY TWENTY THREE REPORT I'LL

03:03:16.085 --> 03:03:18.253

IS. THIS IS. ALMOST A

03:03:36.472 --> 03:03:37.940
STEREOTYPE OF WHAT BARACK

03:03:38.006 --> 03:03:39.942
CHRISSY GONE WILD. AND FROM MY

03:03:40.008 --> 03:03:41.610
PERSPECTIVE IT DOESN'T MAKE

03:03:41.677 --> 03:03:43.846
SENSE I REALLY. AYE MAYBE MAYBE

03:03:43.912 --> 03:03:45.214

TWENTY TWENTY THREE REPORT I

03:03:49.017 --> 03:03:50.786
THOUGHT IT WAS. I THOUGHT YOU

03:03:55.691 --> 03:03:59.395
COMMITTEE AND I'VE SAID THIS

03:03:59.461 --> 03:03:59.995
BEFORE BUT FOR ME. EVERY TIME

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:01.897
WE GET YET ANOTHER MASSIVE I.

03:04:01.964 --> 03:04:03.899
T. PROJECT THAT IS YEARS BEHIND

03:04:03.966 --> 03:04:05.868
AND TENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF

03:04:05.934 --> 03:04:07.035
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OVER

03:04:07.102 --> 03:04:09.004

IT'S BEEN GROUND HOG DAY SO I

03:04:15.878 --> 03:04:17.579
JUST I GUESS I WANT TO ASK YOU.

03:04:17.646 --> 03:04:19.248
WHY IS IT THAT DEPARTMENTS

03:04:19.314 --> 03:04:20.816
DON'T SEEM TO BE LEARNING FROM

03:04:20.883 --> 03:04:22.785
EACH OTHER'S MISTAKES OR WHAT

03:04:22.851 --> 03:04:24.386
CAN WE DO BETTER TO SHARE BEST

03:04:24.453 --> 03:04:25.921

WE'RE FACING. AND I THINK

03:04:47.743 --> 03:04:48.877

DARNDEST AND BEST TO TRYING TO

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:01.056
MAKE THINGS WORK. BUT WHEN

03:05:01.123 --> 03:05:02.791
THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL

THEY'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY FIX

03:05:16.605 --> 03:05:18.407
IT THEMSELVES. AND THAT IS

03:05:18.474 --> 03:05:19.575

INFORMATION AND SERVICES

03:06:29.678 --> 03:06:31.580
ACROSS. OVER THREE HUNDRED

03:06:31.647 --> 03:06:33.448
WEBSITES. MANAGED BY MORE THAN

03:06:33.515 --> 03:06:34.149
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

03:06:34.216 --> 03:06:36.218

STATE WEBSITES NOPE CLEARLY.

03:06:43.325 --> 03:06:44.660
THIS IS A PROBLEM THIS IS AN

03:06:44.726 --> 03:06:46.228
INCREDIBLY INEFFICIENT FOR THE-

03:06:46.295 --> 03:06:48.130
SENATE OUR STATE. WE'RE SEEING

03:06:48.196 --> 03:06:49.398
THIS RIGHT NOW WITH THE

03:06:49.464 --> 03:06:51.133
BREAKDOWNS RIGHT EDT. MY

03:06:51.199 --> 03:06:52.568
QUESTION TO YOU IS THERE AS ARE

03:06:52.634 --> 03:06:54.236
THEIR STATUTORY REASONS THAT

03:06:54.303 --> 03:06:55.971
DEPARTMENTS AREN'T INTEGRATING

03:06:56.038 --> 03:06:58.240
ONLINE SERVICES. LIKE ID

03:06:58.307 --> 03:06:59.741
VERIFICATION INCOME

03:06:59.808 --> 03:07:01.743
VERIFICATION IS THERE MORE.

03:07:01.810 --> 03:07:02.878
THAT WE CAN DO TO PUSH BECAUSE

03:07:02.945 --> 03:07:04.580
THEY WERE UP TO ME. IF I COULD

03:07:04.646 --> 03:07:06.048
GET- YOU KNOW MAJORITY OF OUR

03:07:06.114 --> 03:07:06.882
COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY IN

03:07:06.949 --> 03:07:09.151
THE LEGISLATURE. AND AND THE

03:07:09.217 --> 03:07:11.253
GOVERNOR TO SIGN. IT SEEMS THAT

03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:13.021
WE GOTTA MOVE TOWARD A MORE

03:07:13.088 --> 03:07:14.990
INTEGRATED CENTRALIZED APPROACH

03:07:15.057 --> 03:07:16.325
BUT RIGHT NOW. THIS

03:07:16.391 --> 03:07:18.827
DECENTRALIZED APPROACH IS

03:07:18.894 --> 03:07:20.395
CAUSING ENORMOUS WREAKING

03:07:20.462 --> 03:07:21.463
ENORMOUS HAVOC ON THE DAY TO

03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:25.934
DAY LIVES OF OUR CITIZENS. I'M

03:07:26.001 --> 03:07:28.737
I HAVE JUST TO FREE JUMP IN A

03:07:28.804 --> 03:07:30.439
WELL I THINK YOU THE NAIL. YOU

03:07:30.505 --> 03:07:33.208
KNOW. YOUR OWN ON FACT THAT. WE

03:07:33.275 --> 03:07:35.277
MIGHT HAVE POLICY AUTHORITY WE

03:07:35.344 --> 03:07:36.812
MIGHT EVEN SAY HEY LET'S DO IT

03:07:36.878 --> 03:07:38.714
TOGETHER. BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW

03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:39.948
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THERE'S%

03:07:40.015 --> 03:07:42.551
ENOUGH LEFT SECRETARY FOR THE

03:07:42.618 --> 03:07:44.386
OR I CALL THE CHEAT. BEHIND

03:07:44.453 --> 03:07:48.523
THAT IN ORDER TO NOT. COURAGE

03:07:48.590 --> 03:07:49.925
BUT TO- RIGHT NOT THE WHAT

03:07:49.992 --> 03:07:51.193
MANDATE BUT REALLY REALLY

03:07:51.259 --> 03:07:53.061
ENFORCED THE ABILITY TO COME

03:07:53.128 --> 03:07:54.596
USE THE STANDARD PLATFORM SO

03:07:54.663 --> 03:07:56.298
NOT EVERYBODY INVESTING INTO

03:07:56.365 --> 03:07:57.432
THE SAME SOLUTION MULTIPLE

03:07:57.499 --> 03:07:59.334

DISTRICT- KNOWN AS EXCITED

03:20:44.766 --> 03:20:45.800

03:20:45.867 --> 03:20:47.668
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER ACROSS.

03:20:47.735 --> 03:20:48.569

SO HAVING AN EXPERT IN THIS

03:50:35.888 --> 03:50:38.191

THE FIRST TIME THAT I HEAR

03:51:04.050 --> 03:51:05.284

03:51:11.824 --> 03:51:13.759
TIMES AND I APPRECIATE IT. IT

03:51:13.826 --> 03:51:17.063
JUST SEEMS TO ME. I TAKE THAT

03:51:17.129 --> 03:51:19.131
THOSE POSITIONS VERY SERIOUSLY.

03:51:19.198 --> 03:51:21.367
AND IT SEEMS ONE INDIVIDUAL

03:51:21.434 --> 03:51:23.703
CHARGED. WITH OVERSEEING AN

03:51:23.769 --> 03:51:27.106
ENTIRE GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE-

03:51:27.173 --> 03:51:29.875
IS REALLY. IT CAN LOOK LIKE

03:51:29.942 --> 03:51:31.844
IT'S JUST A FIGURE PERSON AND

03:51:31.911 --> 03:51:32.845
NOT SOMEONE THAT'S ACTUALLY

03:51:32.912 --> 03:51:34.280
GOING TO BE DEDICATED TO DIVING

03:51:34.347 --> 03:51:35.881
INTO THE INEQUITIES ACROSS THE

03:51:35.948 --> 03:51:37.283
VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS

03:51:37.350 --> 03:51:39.585

CLICHE ABOUT THAT IS THE

03:51:47.893 --> 03:51:49.762
JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES

BEGINS WITH ONE SINGLE STAFF-

03:51:52.932 --> 03:51:53.799
ONE OF THE THINGS CRITICAL

03:51:53.866 --> 03:51:56.369
THINGS I. ARE MY OBSERVATION

03:51:56.435 --> 03:51:58.704
HAVING COME IN THERE TO LOOK AT

03:51:58.771 --> 03:52:01.907
