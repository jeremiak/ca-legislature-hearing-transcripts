THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SB THREE THREE TWO AS INTRODUCED WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED A GROSS DOMESTIC IN A QUESTION CENTER DOT DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS POLLS ON PAGE ELEVEN TWELVE COMMENT FIVE DENOUNCES- YOU KNOW THAT WAS MY NEXT LINE MISTER CHAIR ALL WELL. I'M SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF THAT AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU MR CHAIRMAN. IN MY TAM I AM AGREEING TO AMENDMENTS DISCUSSED ON PAGES ELEVEN AND TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS WOULD REMOVE THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL PERTAINING TO GROSS NEGLIGENCE PROTECTION. FOR DAMAGE CLAIMS. THANK YOU CENTER WHICH THAT WE WOULD APPLY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE PROTECTION FOR BURN BOSSES TO FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS. RESULTING FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF A PRESCRIBED FIRE ONLY. ENCOURAGING MORE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE THAN CURRENTLY OCCURS IN THE STATE REMAINS THE GOAL SB THREE THREE TWO. ASCRIBE FIRES TYPICALLY DONE OR SUPERVISOR SUPERVISED BY A BURN BOSS WHO IS WHO IS QUALIFIED TO PLAN ORGANIZE AND EXECUTE WHAT ARE KNOWN AS PRESCRIBED OR CONTROLLED BURNS PRESCRIBED FIRES THE CONTROLLED APPLICATION OF FIRE. TO THE LAND TO REDUCE WILDFIRE HAZARDS CLEAR DOWNED TREES CONTROL PLANT DISEASES IMPROVE RANGELAND AND WILDLIFE HABITATS PROVIDE CULTURAL VALUES IN RESTORED NATURAL ECO SYSTEMS. MY PRESCRIBER ANNIE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND COST EFFECTIVE TOOLS USED TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS INCLUDED PRESCRIBED FIRES A CENTRAL PIECE OF HIS TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND TWENTY TWO ONE BILLION DOLLAR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE BUDGET. WITH CALIFORNIA HAVING SUFFERED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF WILDFIRE LOSSES OVER THE LAST DECADE IT'S PARAMOUNT THAT WE EMPLOY EVERY EFFECTIVE TOOL TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY. INTENSITY AND SCALE OF FUTURE WILDFIRES. EXPERTS TELL US THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE TREATING A MINIMUM OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF WILDLAND WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE EACH YEAR. THE FACT IS. CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES TO TREAT A FRACTION OF THAT AMOUNT ANNUALLY WHILE OTHER STATES SUCH AS FLORIDA TREAT AS MANY AS TWO MILLION ACRES A YEAR. ONE MIGHT ASK WHY IS CALIFORNIA LAG. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS BUT HUGE FACTORS THAT BURN BOSSES OF PROPERTY OWNERS FACE SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL COSTS AND LIABILITY WE'RE CONDUCTING THIS WORK EVEN THOUGH IT BENEFITS SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONCERNS FOR PRACTITIONERS IS THAT THEY WILL BE BILLED OF CAL FIRE PROVIDE SUPPRESSION SUPPORT ON ONE OF THOSE BURNS. THE CONCERN OVER HIGH FIRE SUPPRESSION COST ENCOURAGED AS A PRACTITIONER IN LANDOWNER TO AVOID USING PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND THAT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO GETTING MORE LAND TREATED. THOUGH RARE IT SOMETIMES CONDITIONS CHANGE IN SUPPORT IS NEEDED BUT LANDOWNERS A BIRD BOSSES MAY CHOOSE NOT TO CALL FOR BACK UP UNTIL THE FIRE IS GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL. AND FRANKLY THAT COULD BE TOO LATE. AS SB THREE THREE TWO AS AMENDED WOULD SPECIFY THE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED BIRD BOXES. PERSONS THEY SUPERVISE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HIRE BURN BOSSES IN NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL BURNERS ARE SHIELDED FROM FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS. UNLESS THEY CONDUCT A BURN IN A HIGHLY OR IN A GROSSLY NEGLIGENT MANNER. EARNED BOSS WOULD STILL BE LIABLE FOR SUPPRESSION COSTS IF THEY ACTED IN A RECKLESS MANNER BUT IF THE BURKE BUT IF THE BURN BOSSES CONDUCTING WORK FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT USING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THEY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THESE RARE BUT- COSTLY SUPPRESSION EXPENSES. I BELIEVE THE AMENDED BILL AS A FAIR COMPROMISE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MR- CHAIR IN YOUR CONSULTANT FOR YOUR HELP IN REACHING THIS AGREEMENT AND I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE I VOTE ON THE PHONE TODAY IN SUPPORT OR MY- WITNESSES. LANIER QUINN DAVIDSON AREA FIRE ADVISOR IN UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. IN MICHAEL LARA DIRECTOR OF CLIMATE AND ENERGY POLICY PROGRAM. THE WOODS INSTITUTE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD- LEN YET ARE YOU AVAILABLE. FOR MISTER WARREN. YES I'M HERE THAT MR WAR. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER MARK PLEASE PROCEED HELLO. SORRY I THOUGHT LIKE IT WAS GOING FIRST AND YET LEN YET YOU CANNOT HEAR ME MICHAEL ALL RIGHT LET'S DO THIS WAY OKAY. WELL I MISS QUINN DAVIS GO AHEAD PLEASE. OKAY YOU CAN HEAR ME YES WE CAN. OKAY SORRY ABOUT THAT I'M GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY- MY NAME IS PLAYING IT COULD DAVIS AND I AM WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PRESCRIBED FIRE COUNCIL I'VE WORKED ON PRESCRIBED PAYER ISSUES FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND I'VE HELPED INSPIRE AND LEAD THE GROUNDSWELL OF INTEREST THE PENCIL THAT IN CALIFORNIA. IN RECENT YEARS AND THE TIME IS REALLY RIGHT FOR THE RIGHT KINDS OF CHANGE ON THIS ISSUE THE FIRE PRACTITIONERS I CAN TELL YOU THAT LIABILITY IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST BARRIERS COULD PRESCRIBE FIRE HAS INNUMERABLE PUBLIC BENEFIT CONFIRMS THE RELIABILITY KEEP IT FROM GETTING WORSE. AND WE'RE- LEAD CURRENT FEDERAL AGENCIES AND HEALTHCARE ARE SUPPORTED AND INDEMNIFIED IN THE RARE CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG FIRE EXPERT FROM THE PRIVATE CULTURAL AN NGO STRUCTURES FACE IMMENSE PERSONAL LIABILITY. FOR OUR WORK WHAT. ONLY THE MOST HIGH AND AMONG US FOR LEADING IS A- BECAUSE WE WERE EVERY UP SOME GOES WRONG. THIS IS NOT THE WAY FOR. TO A NEW MORE OF SOCIAL WORK. AS WE WERE OUT THE NEW STATE BUT- PROGRAM A ALLOCATE MORE. FARM FOR SUCH FIRE. WE NEED ADDRESS THIS LIEU WELL OF LIGHT CONCERNS. AND IT'S A- FORM THE BILL ADDRESS CIVIL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES. AND IT'S REVISED FORM IT TACKLE COST RECOVERY FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION. THESE ARE THE TWO MOST CRITICAL FACETS OF LIABILITY AND I WISH WE COULD ADDRESS BOTH I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE BILL IN ITS REVISED FORM WILL BE HUGELY IMPACTFUL. BUT STILL HAD SEVENTY FIVE SUPPORT LETTERS FROM AN IMPRESSIVELY BROAD BASE REINSURERS TRIBES ENVIRONMENTALISTS TIMBER COMPANIES UNIVERSITIES AND CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION. HOW OFTEN DO THOSE GROUPS RALLY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY CO. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO USE PRESCRIBED FIRE THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION. I THINK SENATOR DODD FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THAT AND FOR THE COMMITTEE- AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK. YOU PROFESSOR ALL RIGHT MR TOMORROW. IF YOU'RE. MY COMMENT THEY REFLECT MY OWN VIEWS AND NOT THOSE OF MY EMPLOYER A WILDFIRE FUND FOR YOUR QUICK FORTY. PROSCRIBES FIRE PROVIDES LARGE GROWING BENEFIT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE LIABILITY REGIME WE HAVE TREATED PRIMARILY AS AN ACTIVITY WITH SOLELY PRIVATE BENEFITS. THIS BILL TAKES A MODEST STEP TOWARDS CHANGING THAT BY ALLOWING FOR BIRDS THAT ARE PLANNED BY CERTIFIED BIRD BOXES. HIGHLY SKILLED PRACTITIONERS AND IT RECEIVES ALL REQUIRED PERMITS THE BENEFIT FROM CAL FIRE SUPPRESSION. UNLESS THEY'RE CONDUCTED IN A RECKLESS MANNER. IT IMPORT EMPHASIZED THE BILL CONTAINS A NUMBER OF GUARD RAILS TO PREVENT TO BROAD. OF THIS LIABILITY RELIEF. I WON'T BE ABLE GET SET UP BY TO OF BRUSH MY BACK CLEAN RELIEF I FLETCHER. ONLY BURNS PLAN BY. AND CONDUCT BY. PERSONNEL SEPTIC ALL THE PRINTABLE PERMITS REQUIRED CHALCOPYRITE IN THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THIS RELAXATION BUT THE SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY THAT OTHERWISE APPLY. HISTORY APPROACH BALANCE BETWEEN THIS IS I GOOD BEING PROVIDED BY PRESCRIBED FIRE PRACTITIONERS OFTEN FOR LITTLE PAY ON VOLUNTEER BASIS. AND A MODEST RISK TO THE PUBLIC BUDGET GOES BY CAL FIRE RESPONDED TO YOU AND LETTING IT SIT ON A PRESCRIBED FIRE. THAT RARE ON A RARE OCCASION THE STATE'S CONTAINMENT. ASSEMBLY BILL WOULD SOCIALIZE THE COST THE FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES CALLED TO THE SCENE OF A PRESCRIBED FIRE. MEET THE STRICT CRITERIA LAID OUT IN LANGUAGE ARE YOU TO SUPPORT IT AS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS CREATING A WORKFORCE THAT COULD PROVIDE GREATER SAFETY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. BUT IF THEY LIVE IN WILDFIRE COUNTRY BETTER DIRECTLY SUBJECT TO FIRE FOR ARE SUBJECT TO TERRIBLE SMOKE IMPACTED WILDFIRES CREATED SEVENTY MILLION SUFFERED OVER THE PAST YEAR.

NO ONE OF THE PHONE LINE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE CHAMBERS HE SAID WHAT COUNTS CONSIDER LITTERED WITH THEIR MICROPHONES UP CENTER BY CAL SKI. YEAH FOR I HAVE A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR WAR I'M REVIEWING THE STANFORD WOULD SET A- NEW STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THE WILDFIRE EPIDEMIC. IN CALIFORNIA AND- IT INDICATES THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING A BILLION DOLLARS. TO TREAT A MILLION ACRES A YEAR. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS. OF- REDUCE REDUCE FUEL- THIS WELL THIS. THIS BILL WILL TAKE CARE OF THE LIABILITY PROBLEM YOUTH DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE THE- I GUESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PEOPLE GET A BURNER TO BE MORE FUNDS COMING HI I'M AND I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE ONLY SPENDING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IF THAT'S GOOD IF IT IS COULD MAKE AN APPRECIABLE IMPACT ON THE NEW LANDSCAPE TREATMENT THAT- WHAT THE RISK PROTECTION THAT YOU'RE- HOPING TO EFFECTUATE BY THE BILL. WHO ARE YOU WELL WHAT I'D SAY. OUR SYSTEM CENTER IS THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO ON HOW WE MANAGE FORESTLANDS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE A CENTURY OF- YOU CALL IT THE BIRD MAINTENANCE YOU COULD CALL IT BAD DECISION MAKING OR DECISION MAKING REQUIRE REGRET NOW BUT- THIS BILL IS A SMALL PIECE OF A VERY COMPLEX PUZZLE. AND PART OF THAT PUZZLE IS GONNA INVOLVED WORKING WITH PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GET TO THAT MILLION FOR TARGET BUT I DO THINK THAT IN THE LONG RUN THAT KIND OF THE SCALE IS WHAT WE SHOULD AIM FOR IN ORDER TO FULLY TREAT AND REALLY DRAMATICALLY ALTER A SITUATION THAT IS BEING SUPER CHARGED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. SORRY THANK YOU. FIVE I SEE CENTER STERN'S HANDS UP ALSO BUT LET'S TURN TO SENATOR LAYER THAN CENTER STERN CENTER LAWYER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I WAS GOING TO SPEAK TO THE BILL BUT I THINK I WILL ALSO INCORPORATE OF THE CONCERN OF SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKIER IN MY COMMENTS BECAUSE- THE- THE THIRD CALLER WAS EXACTLY RIGHT. THE THERE'S- A HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION THAT IS BROUGHT UP AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND IS LED TO. WHAT NEEDS TO BE A MAJOR CHANGE IN WHAT WE DO TO PREVENT FIRE. THE STATE HAS BEEN DOING IT YEAR BY YEAR AND THE CURRENT GOAL. WAS TO DO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF PRESCRIBED FIRE IT UP- IN A YEAR. AND I THINK WHAT SENATOR DODD SAID AT SOME POINT IN THIS PROCESS. IS THE ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. ACRES WAS ABLE TO BE DONE BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE AT PLAY- IN THIS. AND I THINK SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI RAISES THE ISSUE THAT'S CORRECT. OUR WHICH IS THAT IT MAY WELL NOT BE ENOUGH AND IT MAY WELL HAVE TO OVERTIME BE HIGHER. AND THE REAL THING IS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING EVEN THOUGH RESOURCES NOW HAS A FIVE YEAR PLAN WE'VE BEEN DOING IT YEAR TO YEAR AND I'VE A BILL TO PUT TOGETHER A FIVE YEAR PLAN. BUT THAT'S AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THE WITNESSES CALLED IN NY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YET SAYS QUESTION WHICH WAS ON THE POLICY. OF OF FIRE PREVENTION BUT WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMITTEE. IS THE LIABILITY PIECE THAT I THINK THAT ORIGINALLY THERE WAS. CONCERN ABOUT THE LIABILITY SECTION AND I'M SURE ALL OF US WOULD BE CONCERNED. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IT AND FIRES WERE BURNING RIGHT AT OUR CONSTITUENTS WITH NOBODY HAVING ANY LIABILITY. AND I THINK THROUGH THE WORK OF THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF AND SENATOR DODD AND HIS STAFF WE HAVE A WORKABLE ALTERNATIVE THAT ALLOWS US TO MEET BOTH GOALS. DUE TO THE FIRE PREVENTION PART THAT EVERYBODY CALLED IN ABOUT TO SEE A SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE WAS CONCERNED IF THE REAL SUPPRESSOR IN THE NUMBER OF ACRES THAT WAS BEING DONE WAS THE LIABILITY ISSUE. AND IF IT'S NOT THE NOT SOMETHING ON THE POLICY LEVEL WE WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS SEPARATELY AND I'M SURE OVER TIME. THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WHAT WAS SUPPOSED IS TOTALLY WORKABLE BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD SOLUTION AND AT THE RIGHT TIME I'M GONNA BE READY TO MOVE THE BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND THE CHAIR. IN GETTING US TO THIS POINT. THANK YOU. CENTER LAYERED US STERN WITH YOUR HAND RAISED. INDEED IT WAS MISTER CHAIR ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD. THANK YOU- CONSIDERABLE- KNOW HOW ON OUR COMMITTEE HERE AT- EVIDENCED BY MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS- NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH AT THE AUTHOR INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP TIME AFTER TIME IN THIS ARENA- AND YOU'RE WORKING THROUGH THE PROBLEMS THIS BILL IS THAT PRESCRIBED FIRE IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE ALWAYS- BUT I THINK THE FRAMEWORK YOU PUT FOR TODAY. AS GOING TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT OF CLARIFICATION IF I COULD WITH THE AUTHOR MISTER CHAIR. SIR THE BILL DOESN'T MANDATE OR- IMPOSE PRESCRIBED FIRES IN ALL THE COLLEGES AROUND THE STATE CORRECT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE LIABILITY RELATED TO THE BURN BOSSES WHO ARE CERTIFIED. THROUGH THE PROCESS IS THAT RIGHT. EVERY EVERY JURISDICTION HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO TRY TO MANAGE FIRES IN THIS AREA THIS JUST HANDLES THE LIABILITY OF PUTTING OUT THOSE FIRES SHOULD ONE GET AWAY. SO I THINK EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE SHOULD BE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING IS WE TRUST IN OUR GOVERNMENT OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR IN CAL FIRE. TO BE THE DECIDERS ON WHERE THESE THINK WHERE THIS IS APPROPRIATE AND ALSO. TO BE THE BACKSTOPS BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SARAH CASKEY WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THAT THE WAY NOW THIS IS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD HAS BEEN SHIFTED. THE BACKSTOP OF THAT LIABILITY ENDS UP BEING ON. ON EITHER LOCAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THERE'S A SORT OF PUBLIC BACKSTOPS NOW AND I'M WILLING TO. INVEST THAT TRUST I GUESS WITH HIS VOTE IN OUR AGENCIES IN OUR FRAMEWORK AND THAT MAY REQUIRE AUGMENTATIONS OF FUNDING TO BOLSTER THAT BACKSTOP BUT I THINK THAT'S A WORTHY PUBLIC INVESTMENT. AND I GUESS THAT THAT WOULD BE. I JURISDICTIONAL YES WITH A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD BUT THAT STANDARD ITSELF WILL DICTATE- THE BROADER FUNDING LANDSCAPE GOING FORWARD I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE BREAKING THROUGH HERE SO INDUSIA ASK LEE HI THANKS FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU. OTHER MICROPHONES OTHER COMMENTS ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK. OF WILL BRING BACK THE CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR DODD YOUR PASSION YOUR- INTEREST YOUR FLEXIBILITY- ALSO SEE MYSELF WITH ALL THE OTHER KUDOS THAT HAVE BEEN- PROVIDER HOPE YOU RECALL MY COMMENTS SHOULD IN MY BILLS APPEAR IN YOUR COMMITTEE.

I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE AND I AM OFFERING AMENDMENTS TO SP THREE SIXTY THREE I THINK EVERYONE HAS RECEIVED THOSE MISTER CHAIR YOU HAVE RECEIVED% THEM AS WELL. SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY THREE FURTHERS CALIFORNIA'S GOAL OF PROVIDING EQUITABLE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL STUDENTS BY REQUIRING BOTH BOYS STATE AND GIRLS STATE PROGRAMS TO OFFER SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SIMILAR COSTS CURRICULUM. SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR ACCESS TO GO OFFICES OFFICIALS EMPHASIZE. EQUAL NUMBER OF. FOR TO PROTEST. AS THERE ARE FOR BOYS. ANY ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS NAMA PER SCHOOL SHALL APPLY TO BOTH PROGRAMS AND NON BINARY STUDENTS MAY APPLY EITHER PROGRAM. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THE AMERICAN LEGION AND THE AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SIMILAR ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS AS WELL AS NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON GENDER. CALIFORNIA BOYS STATE AND GIRLS STATE PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO IMPACT AND IMPORT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF GOVERNMENT AND CIVIC RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL AS PARTICIPATE IN ACTIVELY IN THE PRIVILEGES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DEMOCRACY. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HELD THAT ACCESS TO EDUCATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF ALL PERSONS REGARDLESS OF THEIR GENDER. SADLY YOUNG WOMEN PARTICIPATING CALIFORNIA GIRL STATE ARE NOT AFFORDED COMPATIBLE CIVICS EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AS YOUNG MEN IN CALIFORNIA BOYS STATE EVERY YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YEAR OF A PANDEMIC APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND YOUNG MEN PARTICIPATE IN BOISE STATE VISIT SACRAMENTO AND STATE CAPITOL DURING THE SUMMER MANY OF YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THESE VISITS. CALIFORNIA GIRLS STATE WITH THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES YOU'RE A CAP OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO PARTAKE IN SOME ASPECTS OF CIVIC EDUCATION. BUT ARE NOT AFFORDED THE SAME ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO THEIR GOVERNMENT AS BOYS MOST NOTABLY IN COMING TO SACRAMENTO AND VISITING THEIR STATE CAPITAL. ONE CANNOT TO DOT DENIED THE PROGRAM'S PRESENCE IN SACRAMENTO AFFORDS OPPORTUNITIES THAT STUDENTS MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE. OTHER ECONOMIC WORRIES ALSO EXIST SUCH AS APPLICATION FEES REGISTRATION FEES CAREER FAIRS AND THE LEARNING OF OUTDATED SONGS THAT FOCUS MORE ON THE APPEARANCE OF YOUNG GIRLS THAN ACTUAL CIVICS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE OFFERED THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND SAME TYPE OF EXPOSURE TO THE GOVERNMENT AS OUR YOUNG MEN. IN THE WORDS OF SALLY RIDE THE FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE YOU CANNOT BE WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE. SO IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED AND ARE ALSO ABLE TO VISIT THE HALLS OF POWER IN SACRAMENTO AND THE CAPITAL IF THE YOUNG MEN PARTICIPATING INVOICE STAKE IT TOO AS WELL. MEMBERS I LOOK FORWARD TO AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IN SUPPORT WITH ME HERE TODAY. IS JESSICA STENDER WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES AS WELL SHELBY ENGLE WHO IS A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT GIRLS STATE ALONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA- THIS STANDARD ARE YOU AVAILABLE.

SECRETASE YOU WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES- GOOD- GOOD PRESENT SB SIX FORTY NINE A BILL THAT ALIGNS TENANT PREFERENCES WITH INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT USE TAX CREDIT OR BOND FINANCING TO REDUCE DISPLACEMENT BY USING TENER PREFERENCES. COBA NINETEEN HAS FURTHER AMPLIFIED THE DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BY CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS REDUCED INCOMES AND RISING HOUSING COSTS. DISPLACEMENT BECAUSE LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY PEOPLE OF COLOR REAL TANGIBLE ISSUES INCLUDING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AN EDUCATIONAL DEFICIENCIES. DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES ALSO CALLED SYSTEMS ARE NEIGHBORS. RECENT STUDY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY SHOW THAT OVER HALF OF DISPOSABLE INCOME RESIDENTS HAD TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITIES ENTIRELY. LOCAL TENER PREFERENCES OR CRITICAL TO MANY CITIES HAVE USED TO HELP STABILIZE NEIGHBORHOODS AND PRIORITIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. HOWEVER LOCAL TENANT PREFERENCES CURRENTLY LACK THE STATEWIDE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO COFFIN AND WE USE THEM IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FUNDED WITH TAX CREDITS AND BOND FINANCING. SB SIX FORTY NINE CREATES A STATE POLICY THAT SUPPORTS. HOUSING FOR POPULATIONS AT HIGH RISK PRISON DISPLACEMENT THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN USE TENER PURPOSES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO PROTECT THOSE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THESE CHANGES WILL HELP US TARGET THE BENEFITS OF SCARCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LIMIT DISPLACEMENT IT-REDUCE THE MANY HARMS THAT RESULT FROM DISPLACEMENT. THE USE OF LOCAL TENET PURPOSES CAN ALSO HELP REDUCE OPPOSITION. TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ENHANCE PREDICTABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS LEGISLATION COMPLIMENTS STATE AND FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING LAW BY SUPPORTING LOCAL POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO FOSTER DIVERSITY AND HOUSING CHOICE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF REAL HERNANDEZ. FROM-SO MOST MAJOR IN THE SAN JOSE AREA YEAH CHRIS ALEXANDER FROM THE CITY OF SAN JOSE THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

HISTORICALLY OUR FAMILY SHOULD LIVE IN AREAS ASSEMBLY THAT HAVE BEEN READ LINE. BY THE BANKING AND REAL ESTATE INDUSTRIES. PASSWORD ONLY DONE TO IN THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WE WERE LEFT IN THE BALLPARK ROOM SOCIAL MUTUAL AID NETWORKS ALMOST OUR FAMILIES. AT ONE OF OUR FAMILIES ARE IN WITH RESTORING THROUGH THE ROOF WE ARE EXPERIENCING A KIND OF SUPPORT FAMILIES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE WORKED WITH THE CITY OF SEVERAL DAYS HOUSING DEPARTMENT. TO DEVELOP MANY STRATEGIES TO SALUTE THE DISPLACEMENT OF OUR FAMILY. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN ANTI DISPLACEMENT LOOK WHAT KIND OF PENSIONS POLICIES THAT WE HOPE WILL KEEP OUR FAMILIES AND SALAS NE. WE ARE ASKING THE STATE OF SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS BY ADOPTING SD SIX FORTY NINE. THAT WILL ALLOW INTERNET PREFERENCES WITH. THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE RETIREMENT SO WILL QUALIFY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. FOR TAX CREDITS AND BOND FINANCING. ONE OF OUR LEADERS IN THE SELECT SOME MUCH CHILDREN AND HAS MOVED THAN TEN TIMES AND LAST YEARS. YOU'RE TRYING TO STAY IN THE MAY THIRD DISTRICT IN SOME OF THE- CHEAPER CHILDREN THE HOME.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AS A WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SIX FORTY NINE LOCAL KIND OF PREFERENCE TO PREVENT DISPLACEMENT TAX. LOCAL KIND OF PREFERENCES HELP PRIORITIZE SCARCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOURCES TO HELP STABILISE HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. TO REDUCE THE DISPLACEMENT AND ITS CONCOMITANT IMPACTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE ADOPTED LOCAL HOUSING PREFERENCES HELP KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING UPROOTED FROM THEIR HOMES FAMILIES AND NETWORKS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA SB SIX FORTY NINE WILL PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN BOLSTERING THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR MOST. VULNERABLE RESIDENTS FROM DISPLACEMENT. MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING HELP IS. IN PART BY FEDERAL AND WILLING HOUSING TAX CREDITS. UNDER FEDERAL LAW AN ELIGIBLE PROJECT MUST GENERALLY BE DEDICATED TO A PUBLIC USE. BUT PREFERENCES ARE PERMITTED FOR AMONG OTHERS TENANTS WERE MEMBERS OF A SPECIFIED GROUP UNDER A STATE PROGRAM OR POLICY THAT SUPPORTS HOUSING FOR THE- GROUP. THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WHICH SUPPORTS THIS BILL RIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO MAKE COLLEGE DEFINING TO ALLOW FOR THE USE OF TENET PREFERENCES. IN FEDERAL TAX CREDIT AND BOND FUNDED PROJECTS TO SUPPORT THE USE OF STATE FUNDING IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS. INDEED THIS BILL CREATES. A POLICY SUPPORTING LOCAL TELECONFERENCES IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DISPLACEMENT RISK. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THE TEACHER HOUSING ACT TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT ALSO CREATED A STATE POLICY SUPPORTING THE USE OF FEDERAL AND STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. ON HOUSING FOR TEACHERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES ON LAND OWNED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. OF COURSE CITIES MUST BE COGNISANT OF THE HISTORICAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK. CRAFTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREFERENCE POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH- HOUSING LAWS. THE LADY OF A LOCAL RESIDENT YOU PREFERENCE THE CASE BY CASE DETERMINATION DEPENDS ON SUCH FACTORS OF TH COMPOSITION OF THE COMMUNITY.

THE CODIFIES REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS ON INSURANCE COMPANY GOVERNING BOARDS TO INCLUDE REQUIRING INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE GOVERNING BOARDS DIVERSITY POLICY STATEMENT OR MEASURABLE GOALS AND IT DEFINES THE TERM DIVERSE INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND THE CORN PROGRAM.

UNDER THE NEW SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS REPORTING THRESHOLD IN THE BILL THERE WOULD BE A MODEST INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPORT. HOWEVER WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THESE COMPANIES WITH- ANY SUPPORT. AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED AN ASSISTANT AND WE'LL BE DOING- COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING SESSION BY THE DEPARTMENT STAFF. ALTHOUGH MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES CURRENTLY SHARE THEIR GOVERNING BOARD GOALS AND POLICY STATEMENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT TODAY. SEEKING TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE THE COMPANY AND TO ASSIST THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT PROVIDED GOAL OUR STATEMENTS IN THE PAST. THE BILL PROPOSED LANGUAGE PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY REGARDING WHAT A DIVERSITY POLICY STATEMENT INTEL IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. THE BOARD DIVERSITY SURVEY AND RELATED DATA INCLUDING THE POLICY GOALS AND STATEMENTS ARE REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT CONFIDENTIALLY. AND THEN PUBLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT IN THE AGGREGATE SO AS NOT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY COMPANY OR BOARD MEMBER. COMMISSIONER LARA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE MAINTAIN AN UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION. I BELIEVE THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE EXPECT US TO USE EVERY POSSIBLE TOOL INCLUDING THE FULL SCOPE OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OF THE VERY PEOPLE THAT SIT AND DECISION MAKING THE- AND THAT ARE CONTRACTED WITH TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL GOODS AND SERVICES.
