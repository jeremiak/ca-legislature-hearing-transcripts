00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:50.474
ESTIMATES WE WERE ARE STILL WORK

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.142

SURE THE ESTIMATES ARE

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.545
REASONABLE REFER REFLECTION OF

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.380
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF FROM

00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:58.482
CONFORMITY WITH THE FOR THESE

00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:59.917
IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.084
CONFORMING TO THESE ITEMS.

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:02.819
ARE THE FINAL NUMBERS MAY BE

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:03.420
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT OF WHAT WE

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:04.321
SHOW HERE.

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:05.422
BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:07.157
HAVE SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO PAY

00:47:07.224 --> 00:47:08.725
FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:10.093
PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.562
BUDGET RESILIENCY.

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:12.296
FINALLY --

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:13.897
JUST ABOUT LANGUAGE AND WE

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:15.432

HAPPY TO HELP YOU QUICKLY IT WAS

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:33.283
BURKE.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.152
SO I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:37.187
ESTIMATED NEXT NET CHANGE IN

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:38.522
REVENUE IT STARTS AT ONE POINT

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:39.590
SEVEN BUT THAT IT GOES DOWN TO

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:40.991
ONE POINT FOUR I HAVE TWO

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:42.259
QUESTIONS WHY THE REDUCTION IN

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:44.127
THE SECOND QUESTION IS DOES THAT

00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:46.129
CONTINUE TO REDUCE --

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.497
THE REDUCTION IS GENERALLY

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:50.000
BECAUSE WHEN WE CAN FOR

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:52.102
CONFORMING.

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:54.504
AS A ONE ONE NINETEEN AND AND

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:56.506
BUT WORKING FOR ME AT THE END OF

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:57.241
EIGHTEEN NINETY SO NONE OF THE

00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:58.842
NONE OF THE TWO THOUSAND

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.310
NINETEEN REVENUE CAN SHOW OPEN

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:01.445

EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT'S ALL GONNA

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:02.679
SHOW FOR NINETEEN TWENTIES OF

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:04.715
CENTURY NINETY TWENTY EFFECTS OF

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:06.817
DOUBLING UP OKAY SO I'M NOT

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:07.417
SAYING THAT WOULD STAY

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:08.986
IDENTICALLY AT ONE POINT FOUR

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:09.553
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.787
CHANGE OVER TIME BUT WE

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.456
GENERALLY EXPECT THE NUMBER TO

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:15.392
BE AROUND ONE POINT FOUR LIVING.

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:17.628
COMING OUT [inaudible]

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:19.396

I'M GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.470
E. H. PROPOSED THE EIGHTIES AND

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.005

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.815
SO IF YOU WOULD TURN TO PAGE TWO

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:40.284
OF THE HEARING AGENDA.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.286
THERE IS A LINE GRAPH THAT YOU

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:43.720
KNOW SHOWS HOW MUCH PEOPLE WERE

00:48:43.787 --> 00:48:44.988

EIGHTY SI YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:50.427
EACH INCOME LEVEL.

00:48:50.494 --> 00:48:53.196
SO IF YOU SEE ARM WELL FIRST OF

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:55.732

DEPENDENT UNDER AGE.

00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:01.705
SIX IS GOING TO GET FIVE HUNDRED

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.040
DOLLARS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AT

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:04.341

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:05.242
INCOME.

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.210
IF YOUR INCOME IS IN THE RANGE

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:08.979
BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:10.147
DOLLARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:11.415
DOLLARS IT PHASES OUT TO AVOID A

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:15.585
CLIFF AT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS --

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:17.487
THIS THE MORE COMPLICATED PIECE

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:20.223
OF THE PROPOSED EXPANSION IF YOU

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.858
NOTICE --

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:24.027
THE PHASE OUT RANGE OF THE E. I.

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:25.329
T. C. OVER WHICH YOUR E. I. T.

00:49:25.395 --> 00:49:26.930
C. M..

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:29.266
ABOUT DECLINES AS THEIR INCOME

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:30.801
RISES NOTICE THERE'S A KINK IN

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:32.202
IT.

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:34.538
SO UNDER CURRENT LAW. FOR FILER

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:36.873
WITH TWO DEPENDENTS THAT KINK

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.076
COMES AT ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND

00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:40.444
DOLLARS OF INCOME.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.713
UNDER THIS PROPOSAL --

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.414
PEOPLE WHOSE INCOME IS YOU'RE

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:46.350
JUST BELOW THE KINK --

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:47.451
TO YOU KNOW IF A FAIR AMOUNT

00:49:47.517 --> 00:49:48.785
ABOVE IT WILL GET THE BIGGEST

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:49.986
BENEFITS.

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.321
BUT IF YOUR INCOME IF YOUR

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.989
CURRENT.

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.492
INCOME IS TOO FAR BELOW THE KINK

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.994
AMOUNT YOU DON'T GET A BENEFIT

00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:59.162
FROM THIS PROPOSAL UNLESS YOU

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:00.831
HAVE IT AT LEAST ONE DEPENDENT

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:02.632
UNDER THE AGE OF SIX NOW THIS

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.634
CRAFT SHOWS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:06.436
IF YOU HAVE TO DEPENDENCE.

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:07.871
IF YOU HAVE ONE DEPENDENT THAT

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:10.140
KING COMES IN ABOUT TEN THOUSAND

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:11.608
DOLLARS OF INCOME SO PEOPLE YEAH

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:13.877
WITH INCOME FROM ROUGHLY TEN

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:14.444
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A LITTLE

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:15.545
MORE WILL SEE THE BIGGEST

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:16.780
BENEFITS.

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.115
IF YOU HAVE NO DEPENDENTS THAT

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:20.016
KING COMES BETWEEN FIVE THOUSAND

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.551
AND SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:22.252
INCOME.

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:24.621
BUT THE AMOUNTS THAT YOU GET IF

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:26.490
YOU HAVE NO DEPENDENTS ARE VERY

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:27.958
SMALL TO BEGIN WITH AND SO THE

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:29.760
THE BENNETT THE INCREASE YOU

00:50:29.826 --> 00:50:32.028
WOULD GET FROM THIS EXPANSION IS

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:34.030
ALSO FAIRLY SMALL.

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:35.465
OKAY -- I

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.434
LIKE TO TURN TO THE CRITERIA

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:39.269
THAT OUR OFFICE USES TO EVALUATE

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:41.238
YEAH I SEE PURPLE YEAH A T. C.

00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:42.906
PROPOSALS.

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:44.207
FIRST OF ALL WE LOOK AT THE WE

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:45.375
THE EFFECT THAT WE THINK THE

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:46.877
PROPOSAL HAVE ON POVERTY IN THE

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:49.946
STATE. FOR ANY EIGHTY SEE

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:51.681
EXPANSION OF ANY GIVEN SIZE

00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:53.316
THERE'S A TRADE OFF BETWEEN HOW

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:55.085
MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN REACH AND

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.987
HOW MUCH HELP YOU CAN GET GIVE

00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:59.656
THE EACH A BENEFICIARY.

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:00.290
THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL TENDS

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:03.326
TO GO AS OPPOSED TO GOING DEEP

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:04.961
BECAUSE IT IT REACHES A LOT OF

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.963
PEOPLE WITH INCOME BELOW THE

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.632
POVERTY LEVEL OR NOT MUCH ABOVE

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:09.533
IT.

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:11.635
BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM MAKE A

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.870
HUGE AMOUNT --

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:17.240
AND IT ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:18.542
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LINE GRAPH

00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:19.843
AGAIN IT DOESN'T GIVE A WHOLE

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.279
LOT TO PEOPLE WHOSE INCOME.

00:51:22.345 --> 00:51:24.514
UP BACK UP IT DOESN'T GIVE A

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:26.650
WHOLE LOT TO THE THE ELIGIBLE

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.852
FILERS WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.387
IT GIVES MORE TO THE PEOPLE SORT

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:33.623
OF AT THE UPPER END OF THE

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:33.890
ELIGIBLE.

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.492
RANGE.

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:37.661
SEC THE SECOND THING WE LOOK AT

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:40.797
IS THE PROPOSALS AFFECT ON WORK

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:42.532
FORCE PARTICIPATION.

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.568
NOW THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:46.470
THE EITC.

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:48.472
HAS A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

00:51:48.538 --> 00:51:50.907
IN TERMS OF INDUCING PEOPLE TO

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.209
JOIN THE WORK FORCE.

00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:53.777
HOWEVER IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:55.979
HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE HOURS

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.981
WORKED OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.449
IN THE WORK FORCE.

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:01.418
AND SO THIS PROPOSAL WE EXPECT

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:03.286
WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE A MAJOR

00:52:03.353 --> 00:52:05.188
IMPACT ON OF PEOPLE'S WORK

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:06.523
PARTICIPATION.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.258
MOSTLY BECAUSE IT CONCENTRATES

00:52:08.325 --> 00:52:10.193
THE BENEFIT TOWARD THE TAIL END

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.628
OF THE ELIGIBLE INCOME RANGE FOR

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:13.597
THE EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S WORK

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:16.533
HOURS IS GENERALLY SMALLER.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.101
OKAY FINALLY OUR OUR ROUTE

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:19.836
REPORT THAT WE PUT OUT A FEW

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:21.004
DAYS AGO.

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.272
SUGGEST SOME POTENTIAL

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:23.940
ALTERNATIVES THAT THE

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:25.642
LEGISLATURE COULD PURSUE.

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:26.276
IF THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:29.045
TARGETING THE IN TOWARD --

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:31.014
RELIEVING DEEP POVERTY OR TOWARD

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:32.816
ENCOURAGING WORK WE ALSO

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:34.851
DISCUSSED SOME POSSIBILITIES FOR

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.119
PROVIDING THE CREDIT ON A

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:38.922
MONTHLY BASIS TO RECIPIENTS.

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:40.524
AND WE'D BE HAPPY.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:41.791
TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IF

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:45.829
YOU'RE INTERESTED.

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:47.464
THANK YOU MISS BURKE.

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:49.299
I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS --

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:50.734
ONE AND AND I THINK.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.002
ON THE WORK WE DO ON POVERTY

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:53.570
OBVIOUSLY AT THE HOPE IS THAT IT

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:55.338
COMES OUT ON A MONTHLY BASIS I

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:57.474
THINK OUR STE OUR STUDY HAS

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:59.009
SHOWN THAT THAT IS A BETTER

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:01.044
OPTION HOWEVER I AM CURIOUS.

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:03.246
ABOUT HOW MUCH WHEN YOU SAY THAT

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:04.714
THERE IS THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:07.017
ITC IS NOT ENCOURAGING

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:08.685
NECESSARILY THE GROWTH OF OUR IS

PRETTY YOU KNOW.

FOR PRE TAX EARNINGS THEY FIND

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.682
THAT THE IMPACT ON THE HOURS

00:54:45.749 --> 00:54:47.417
THAT PEOPLE WORK IS ACTUALLY NOT

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:47.984
THAT HIGH IN SO [inaudible]

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:51.588
THE ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:53.123
THAT IS SORT OF THE WORRIES THAT

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:54.724
PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE EITC

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.459
DISCOURAGING WORK IN THE PHASE

00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:59.562
OUT RANGE --

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:01.164
IT TURNS OUT NOT TO ACTUALLY BE

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:05.001
THAT BAD IN THOSE TERMS

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:05.301

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.644
WITH THE CHI RISING INCOME

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:15.879
INEQUALITY ESPECIALLY WITH THE

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:17.213
COST OF HOUSING.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.348
IN FACT I THINK WE SHOULD EXPAND

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:19.783
UTC TO INCLUDE --

DRESS THAT COMPLETELY --

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:40.290
I I THINK I THINK GENERAL THE

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:42.759
EITC WE'VE BEEN --

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.360
IT'S BEEN A SUBSET OF THE OF THE

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:45.895
FEDERAL PROGRAM.

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:48.364

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:50.500
AND ALLOWED THE HC AND FEDERAL

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:50.767
PROGRAM.

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.168
LAST YEAR WE WE DID MAKE A BREAK

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.770
FROM THE FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT WE

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:55.705

DEPENDENT SO WE HAVE WE HAVE

00:58:02.946 --> 00:58:04.447
MADE THAT THAT BREAK BUT I'D SAY

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.683
GENERALLY THE THE STARTING POINT

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:07.283
IS.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.785
YOU WERE WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.954
IT CONSISTS WITH FEDERAL PROGRAM

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:11.554
BECAUSE IT MAKES IT EASIER TO

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:12.522
ADMINISTER --

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.624
AND AND BUT I I I DON'T KNOW

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:15.792

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:19.128
GOOD ANSWERS TO WHAT SORT OF

00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:22.332

TO TO PROVIDING --

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:25.568
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:26.302
LOOKING INTO WHO TOOK.

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:27.403
GREAT IF WE COULD GET SOME

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.905
ANALYSIS ABOUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:29.973
MS WOODS SAID --

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:32.108
THAT THE IDEA THAT ONE CATEGORY

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:33.109
WOULD RECEIVE THIS IN ANOTHER

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:35.211
CATEGORY WOULDN'T DOESN'T FEEL

00:58:35.278 --> 00:58:36.512
FAIR DOESN'T FEEL EQUITABLE.

00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:38.081

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:45.355
THAT'S WELL I AND AND I THE

00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:46.823
OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.491
THERE IS A BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS

00:58:48.558 --> 00:58:49.392
SO WE CAN'T.

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:50.793
AND AND I THINK WE DO HAVE AN S.

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.598
WITH THE DOLLARS TO PROVIDE. TO

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:57.400

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:19.555
COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:21.457
WHAT IF TO BE HAS SAID AS FAR AS

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.393
WHAT TYPE OF ISSUES WOULD NEED

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:24.894
TO BE FIGURED OUT TO IMPLEMENT.

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:27.964
MONTHLY DISBURSEMENT --

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:28.631
HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE WHAT'S

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:30.600
A REALISTIC TIME FRAME FOR FOR

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:31.567
DOING THAT?

00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:33.269
YEAH WE WE ARE STILL EARLY IN

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:35.071
THE PROCESS OF OF DETERMINING

00:59:35.138 --> 00:59:37.073
HOW THAT HOW THAT WOULD WORK --

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.641
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PROBLEM

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:40.810
WITH WITH AN ADMINISTRATION

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:42.779
MONTHLY PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE.

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:43.546
IS THAT --

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:47.417
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH.

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:50.219
EITC HOUSEHOLD IS GOING TO EARN

00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:51.187
HER IS GOING TO HE'S GOING TO

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:53.890
EARN -- AND

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:54.891
YOU.

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.693
WON A SECOND JOB AT THE END OF

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:59.195
THE YEAR THAT BRINGS IN A COUPLE

00:59:59.262 --> 00:59:59.862
THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD CHANGE RE

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.831
H. C. DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE WE'VE

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:03.132
GOT -- YOU

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:05.401
KNOW THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL TAX

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.936
THE EIGHTY SI HAS MORE OF A IF

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.338
YOU KNOW IT IT INCREASES FOR ALL

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:09.572
THAT IT PLATEAUS AND THEN IT

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:10.640
DROPS OFF.

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:12.909
AND SO THERE LOOK. FOR THAT

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:15.345
PROGRAM IS A LITTLE MORE --

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.747
WILL YOU NOT SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:19.248
HAVING SMALL CHANGES IN INCOME

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.783
DROPPED DRAMATICALLY CHANGE HE

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.318
EIGHTY SO THAT SO THERE'S

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:23.586
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:24.387
SO I'LL JUST SAY THAT'S A

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.122
PROBLEM THAT WERE THAT WERE

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:26.622
TRYING TO SEE HOW WE CAN

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:27.623
OVERCOME THAT --

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.592
WAYS THAT WE CAN BECAUSE THAT IS

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:31.294
CERTAINLY SOME THE GOVERNOR HAS --

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:32.762
HAS HAS.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:34.397
SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.165
THAT THAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING AND

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:37.834
WE ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO DO THAT.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:41.104
BUT AT THIS POINT.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:44.507
HI I AM THAT SAID THERE IS TO

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:47.176
SEE HE CONCEPTUALLY A PROBLEM

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.012
WITH KNOWING BEFORE HAND HOW

01:00:49.078 --> 01:00:50.613
MUCH EARNED INCOME TAX READ.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.948
TEXTURES GOING TO EARN AND WE DO

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:53.750
KNOW THAT PEOPLE TEND TO MOVE IN

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.018
AND OUT OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:55.852
CREDIT --

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.820
FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY FROM YEAR TO

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:59.088
YEAR SO THEY DON'T AND IT

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:01.190
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE SAME

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.225
EXACT EXACT SAME PEOPLE.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:03.192
GETTING THE HC CHEERS SO YOU

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:04.627
CAN'T JUST RELY ON WHAT THEY GOT

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.462
LAST YEAR --

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.230
FOR WHAT THEY'LL GET TAX YEAR

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:08.931
OKAY --

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.133
THIRD TOPIC --

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.567
I WAS CONSIDERING THIS YOU'RE

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:12.969
MOVING THE BILL FOR AROUND THE

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:14.470
TOPIC OF AUTOMATIC FILING AND I

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.938
WANTED TO GET A SENSE.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:16.839
I KNOW IN THE EARLY TWO

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.574
THOUSANDS CALIFORNIA HAD A READY

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:20.076
RETURN PROGRAM.

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.677
AND WONDERING HAS THERE BEEN A

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.813
CONVERSATION ABOUT REVIVING THAT

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.518
MODEL FOR THE EIGHTIES SEE

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:31.320
ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS --

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:32.855
I'M THERE THERE ISN'T THERE'S

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:34.057
NOT BEEN A CONVERSATION AS YET.

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:35.158
CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:36.826
COULD LOOK INTO IF THIRTY

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.662
SOMETHING YEAR --

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:40.563
LOVE TO GETS MORE EDUCATION OKAY

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.364
YEP TO GET MORE INFORMATION

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.498
ABOUT THAT AND WE CAN COLLEAGUES

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:43.599
WHAT WHAT THAT REALLY ADDRESSES

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:44.534
THE FACT THAT.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.502
THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:47.937
DO NOT OWE TAXES YOU DON'T HAVE

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.305
A REASON A FILE BUT THUS THEY

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.540
DON'T GET THE REFUNDABLE CREDIT

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:52.442
SO THE IDEA IS HOW DO WE CAPTURE

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:53.843
THAT GROUP OF FOLKS --

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.244
LESSER QUESTIONS I HAVE --

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.680
AND I WOULD PROPOSES TO EITHER

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:59.849
NOW THE ADMINISTRATION OR TO THE

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.685
LA -- IS --

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:03.086
WE TALKED ABOUT --

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.121
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION TO

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.090
HOUSEHOLDS WITH.

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.825
KIDS I'M WONDERING HAS THERE

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.226
BEEN ANALYSIS OF HOW THIS CREDIT

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.861
WOULD AFFECT CHILDREN IN DEEP

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:12.695
POVERTY.

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.163
THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST AND

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.865
CHAIRWOMAN OF OUR PROTECT HIM

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:17.867
HE'S BEEN LEADING ON THAT AND I

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.102
THINK MANY OF US ARE INTERESTED

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:21.737
IN WHAT THAT IMPACT WOULD BE --

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:23.406
THE MULTIPLIER EFFECTS HOW WE

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:28.277
CAN JUSTIFY THIS --

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.146
I MEAN I I I I CAN'T I CAN'T

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:31.481
TELL YOU THAT I'VE DONE A OF AN

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:33.082
ANALYSIS OF THAT OTHER THAN THAT

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:34.350
IT WOULD IT CERTAINLY WOULD

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:37.186
PROVIDE --

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:37.820
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH WOULD

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:39.021
BE SIGNIFICANT HELP TO THOSE

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.556
HOUSEHOLDS DO WE KNOW FOR LA --

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:41.757
HAVE YOU DONE ANY ADDITIONAL

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.326
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF WHAT THAT

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:44.994
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:46.429
BUT WE HAVEN'T TRIED TO DO ANY

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.164
SORT OF MODEL LIKE HOW MIGHT

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:49.132
THAT IT.

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:50.867
THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE ECONOMY IN

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:53.035
OTHER WAYS OR HOW WOULD YOU KNOW.

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:54.804
WHAT AFFECT OTHER OUTCOMES FOR

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.772
THEM BUT WE HAVE SORT OF RUN

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:58.708
ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE IN

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:01.544
DEEP POVERTY READ BE AFFECTED BY --

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:02.945
THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOR

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:04.614
PROPOSAL AND BY SOME OF THE

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.682
ALTERNATIVES WE TALKED ABOUT.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:07.150
TO COULD YOU GET THAT

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:08.851
INFORMATION TO US.

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:11.354
I WOULD NEED MORE OF A SPECIFIC

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.490
A QUESTION LIKE --

01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:15.992
WHAT SPECIFICALLY YOU WANT US TO

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.193
ESTIMATE --

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.928
TRY TO LOOK INTO IF YOU SAID YOU

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.696
RAN SOME MODELS ON THE IMPACT OF

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:21.564
THIS --

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.766
ANOTHER FAMILIES AND THE POVERTY

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:24.667
YEAH WE DID --

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.869
IN OUR REPORT WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:29.705
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE --

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:31.707
WHO WOULD BE MOVED OUT OF

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:35.411
POVERTY OR OUT OF DEEP POVERTY --

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:36.812

ALTERNATIVES.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:42.318
OKAY.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.586
AND THE FINAL QUESTION HAS THERE

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.322
BEEN ANY ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:48.224
CARE GIVERS OF ADULTS COULD BE

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:50.126
ELIGIBLE IF WE EXTENDED THE

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:51.861
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CARE FOR

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.863

WHAT WE KNOW OF THE NUMBERS THAT

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:02.939
ARE COMING UP AND HOW

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.207
CHALLENGING THE SITUATION IS FOR

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:06.842
FAMILIES --

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.744
I BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT'S I

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:09.679
BELIEVE THAT SOME POINT I'VE

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:10.947
I'VE ASKED A QUESTION I BUT I

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:12.348
DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:13.649

SIMILAR CHOOSE QUESTION

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.428
SOMEWHERE IN ONE OF THE REPORTS

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:26.929
A FEELING I REMEMBER AS

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.998
STATEMENT ABOUT THAT THE WAY

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:31.067
THAT THE SYSTEM AS PROPOSED IS

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:32.935
DESIGNED IS THAT IT WILL BRING

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:34.237
SMALLER AMOUNT OF DOLLARS TO

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:36.405
MORE PEOPLE HOWEVER LIFT.

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:39.408

WAY --

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:50.553
HUNTER WAS ADDRESS L. ELLIE OKAY.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.088
WELL IT IS ONE YEAH SO SO THE

WAY THE THE THE ITC WAS

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:55.157
ORIGINALLY STRUCTURED IT WAS IT

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.993
WAS A FOCUSED ON ON THE LOWEST

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.262
INCOME TAXPAYERS THE INTERFACE

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.096

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.332
THE FEDERAL EITC PHASE OUT.

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:04.634
AS WE'VE BEEN --

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.235
INCREASING OVER THE LAST FEW

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:07.303
YEARS.

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.405
IT'S BEEN INCREASED --

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:10.773
WE'VE BEEN INCREASING IT.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.308
FOR UPPER INCOME.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.909
TAXPAYERS NOT HIGH INCOME BUT

SO -- BUT

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.284
WHAT WE'VE BEEN GIVING TO THOSE

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.918
HOUSEHOLDS IS FAIRLY MEAGER

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:23.919
AMOUNTS YOU KNOW AND SO WHAT

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:25.121

TO BUILD UP THAT THE H. C.

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:29.392
STRUCTURE SO THAT THERE CAN

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:30.359
THOSE.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:33.229
THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ARE GETTING A A

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.397
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FROM THE

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.498
ATC.

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:37.433
SO THAT WAS THE ADJUSTMENT IN

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.868
THE P. BECAUSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:39.635
TO DESCRIBE TO ME AT THIS

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:42.905
PROPOSAL IMPACT WOULD BE BROAD

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:43.773
NOT DEEP --

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.074
AND SO IS THAT THE REASONING FOR

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:46.042
SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN WHERE

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.311
THE PEAK WOULD BE ON THIS ON THE

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:49.945
GRAPH THAT YOU DIDN'T DO THIS

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.914
CRAP I THINK YOU DID THIS CRAFT.

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.250
THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT'S THE IT'S

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:57.753
ON YOUR AT CRAP THAT'S ON PAGE

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:02.358
TWO OF THE ASSEMBLY THE AGENDA

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:02.658
[inaudible]

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.193
OKAY.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:04.427
YES --

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:05.361
CAROLINE TO FROM LEGISLATIVE

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:06.529
ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT THE FIGURE

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.230
YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS FROM OUR

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:11.400
REPORT ON AND SPECIFICALLY IN

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:12.802
TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON DEEP.

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:13.602
FAMILIES MOVING FROM DEEP

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:15.638
POVERTY OR OUT OF POVERTY DEEP

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.740
POVERTY BEING 50% OF THE FEDERAL

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:18.808
POVERTY LEVEL.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.276
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL --

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.278
MOVES ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.846
FAMILIES OUT OF DEEP POVERTY

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.314
MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE LIKELY

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:26.615
FAMILIES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVING

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.250
THE EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.353
CREDIT BUT WE CAN DIG INTO THAT.

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:31.253
FOR YOU MORE --

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.123
TO TO GET A BETTER AND THEN THE

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.225
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MOVES FIFTY

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:37.893
THOUSAND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.462
SPECIFICALLY --

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:41.864
SO IT DOES HAVE A BIGGER PUSH OF

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:43.366
TWO FAMILIES FROM ONE SIDE OF

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:45.634
THE POVERTY THRESHOLD VERSES THE

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:46.936
DEEP POVERTY THRESHOLD.

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:48.771
AND DO WE HAVE ANY REASONING WHY

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.740
WE CHOSE.

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:53.275
TO MOVE THE PEOPLE WHO LEAVE THE

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:53.876
TWELVE THOUSAND I MEAN SO IT'S

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.144
LIKE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.246
THOUSAND RIGHT IN DEEP POVERTY

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:57.847
RIGHT NOW HOW DID WE CHOOSE TO

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:00.282
THE ONLY TWELVE THOUSAND OF

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:01.450
THOSE AFFECTED HIM FIFTY

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.853
THOUSAND OUT OF POVERTY.

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:07.757
AND I A I WOULD GO GO BACK --

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:08.324
TO WE HAVE LEARNED OBVIOUSLY

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:10.626
LIMITED BUDGETARY RESIDE GET

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.027
THAT AND AND SO.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.562
THE AGENCY THAT WOULD THAT WAS

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.898
ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED WAS FOCUS

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:17.500
ON THE VERY LOW INCOME YEAH.

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:19.268
WE'VE BEEN AND AND EACH OF THE

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.437
EXPANSION HAS BEEN TRYING.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.506
TO STRETCH IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE --

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:24.940
WHO ARE STILL IN IN DIFFICULT

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:27.042
FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.977
COULD USE IT IS HOPE AND AND SO

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:28.511
ARE?

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:31.347
EXPANSION FOCUSES ON ON REALLY

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:34.417
GIVING A MEANINGFUL HE IDC TO

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:37.953
THOSE FAMILIES PLUS THE THE

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.321
CREDIT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:41.457
CREDIT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:44.360
FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:46.796
IN THIS PETRIE-NORRIS.

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.297
BACK TO A QUESTION ON THE

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:51.834
ALEJO'S ANALYSIS SO I THINK YOU

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:52.902
SAID -- THAT.

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.270
YOU WOULD NOT ANTICIPATE FROM

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.005
THE FOR THE PROPOSAL AS

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.540
PRESENTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:58.607
THAT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:00.009
IMPACT ON WORK FORCE

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:01.477
PARTICIPATION.

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:03.279
AND CAN YOU BRIEFLY TOUCH ON

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:04.580
WAYS IN WHICH YOU THINK WE COULD

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:07.683
STRUCTURE IT DIFFERENTLY THAT

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.852
WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION YES --

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:12.788
THE ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL WE

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:15.124
DESCRIBE ON STARTING ON PAGE

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.892
NINE OF OUR REPORT.

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:17.993
IN THAT.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.929
AS SHOWN IN FIGURE SIX ON PAGE

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.997
TEN OF THE REPORT.

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:25.034
IT WOULD BASICALLY INVOLVE --

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.435
INCREASING THE PEAK ABOUT IT

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:29.505
WOULD KEEP THE EITC PERCENTAGE

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:31.207
THE SAME IT WOULD IT WOULD.

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.007
PEOPLE WOULD GET THOSE

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:33.909
PERCENTAGES OVER A SLIGHTLY

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:35.845
BIGGER RANGE OF INCOME AND SO

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:38.113
THE NET IMPACT IS IT SAFE FOR

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.715
SOMEBODY WHO IS --

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.650
SOUND ELEVEN THOUSAND OR TWELVE

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.052
THOUSAND DOLLARS OF PRE TAX

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.119
EARNINGS THEY WOULD GET A MUCH

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:45.721
BIGGER BOOST TO THEIR E. I. T.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:46.589
C..

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:48.424
THEN THEY WOULD UNDER CURRENT

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.092
LAW ARE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:50.793
PROPOSAL.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.062
AND WE TEND TO FOCUS ON A LIKE

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:54.530
THINGS LIKE ELEVEN THOUSAND

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:56.332
DOLLARS A YEAR TWELVE THOUSAND

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:56.966
DOLLARS A YEAR BECAUSE THAT'S

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.267
ABOUT WHERE YOU'D BE IF YOU'RE

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.736
WORKING ROUGHLY HALF TIME.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.304
AT THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THEM THE

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:03.639
MINIMUM WAGE WE ACTUALLY SORT OF

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.407
MISS IDENTIFIES BEING ELEVEN

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.976
DOLLARS AN HOUR IT'S ONLY ELEVEN

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:09.879
DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR PEOPLE WHO --

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.413
FOR EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE TWENTY

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.016
FIVE OR FEWER WORKERS --

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:15.484
IT'S IT'S TWELVE THOUSAND

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:16.685
DOLLARS IT'S PART IN TWELVE

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.120
DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR MOST PEOPLE

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.388
BUT IT THAT DOESN'T.

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:21.991
AFFECT NOW WITH OUR CONCLUSIONS

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.726
MUCH IN.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:24.460
YES YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHAT

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.394
YOU'RE THE SORT OF ALTERNATIVE

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.062
WOULD DO IT WITH PEOPLE IN THAT

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:29.832
INCOME RANGE.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.066
I WAS ALSO I WAS KIND OF

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:33.636
INTRIGUED BY YOUR POTENTIAL

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:36.005
PROPOSAL THAT THE EXPANDED CHILD

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:37.840
CARE TAX CREDIT COULD BE AN

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.208
ALTERNATIVE TO THE FIVE HUNDRED

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.175
DOLLAR CREDIT.

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:43.045
IS THAT SOMETHING.

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:43.679
THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKED AT

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:44.313
AS WELL.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.482
YEAH I'M I THINK I THINK THE THE

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:46.782
PROBLEM --

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.151
THE THE THE WEAKNESS WITHOUT

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:52.154
PROPOSAL IS THAT IT THEM THE

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.689
THERE THAT MONEY WOULD NOT GO TO

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.224
TAXPAYERS TO USE HER USING

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:56.926
INFORMAL CHILD CARE --

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.460
SO WOULD ONLY GO TO THOSE WHO GO

01:09:58.527 --> 01:09:59.361
THROUGH FORMAL AND SO WE THINK

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:02.197
THAT WOULD LEAVE OUT OF A LARGE

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:05.668
SWATH OF THE POPULATION. FOR THE

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:07.770
L. L. LIKE HERE MORE IN YOUR

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:10.172
VIEW OF THE CONFORMITY.

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.674
SURE BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.009
OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE --

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:16.512
WE HAD A HAND OUT THAT HAS A CAR

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:19.048
FOR YOU.

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:20.049
HOW WE --

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:21.317
SUGGEST CONSIDERING TAX

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.152
CONFORMITY PROVISIONS.

01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:24.486
THE GENERAL CLOSER CONFORMITY

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:26.121
BETWEEN THE STATE AND FEDERAL

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:27.523
TAX LAWS IS BENEFICIAL BECAUSE

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:28.824
IT MAKES TAX COMPLIANT SOMEWHAT

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.259
EASIER --

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.127
MORE OVER --

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:34.129
CLOSER CONFORMITY --

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.864
BENEFITS THE STATE AND FILERS

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:36.732
ALIKE --

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.000
BECAUSE THEY CAN RELY ON FEDERAL

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.835
REGULATIONS AND FEDERAL JUDICIAL

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.804
OPINIONS AND INTERPRETING TAX

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.705
LAWS.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:46.208
AND RESOLVING TAX DISPUTES --

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.376
THAT SAID YOU MAY WANT TO

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:49.144
CONSIDER THE MERITS OF EACH OF

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:51.080
THE CONFORMITY PROVISIONS --

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:53.816
FOR PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR.

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:55.150
INDIVIDUALLY --

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:56.318
LATER IN OUR HAND OUT AND ALSO

GOVERNOR'S CONFORMITY PROPOSAL.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.494
WE FIND THAT THE FIRST FIVE

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:06.962
ITEMS ON THE TABLE ARE GENERALLY

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.897
REASONABLE AND THAT ON THE

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:11.300
ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF CONFORMING.

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:13.969
ARE STRONGER THAN THOSE AGAINST

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.704
CONFORMING --

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.706
THESE ARE THE LIMITING NON

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:19.375
CORPORATE BUSINESS LOSSES

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:21.443
ELIMINATING THE KNOLL KERRY

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.978
BACKS IT'S NOT OPERATING LOSSES.

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:24.980
CHANGING THE LIKE KIND EXCHANGE

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.582
RULES -- TO

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:28.250
JUST ALLOW THAT PROVISION FOR

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:29.451
REAL PROPERTY.

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:32.955
EXCHANGES LIMITING DEDUCTION AND

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.957
INCREASING THE FLEXIBILITY FOR

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:36.592
SMALL BUSINESS ACCOUNTING RULES.

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.527
SO -- I

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:40.863
THINK THE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.131
DESCRIBE THOSE BUT IF YOU HAVE

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:44.566
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE WERE

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.301
HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT --

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:47.936
THE END OF THIS --

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.938
THE SIX ITEM ON THIS LIST IS THE

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:53.042
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS --

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:55.711
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:56.478
PROPOSAL --

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:59.682

OPPORTUNITIES OWNS PROGRAM.

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:06.288
THE THE FEDERAL INCENTIVE IS IS

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:08.824
HIS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND SO --

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:10.325
OUR MAIN CONCERN IS JUST THAT --

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:12.094
THERE'S INVESTORS BENEFITING

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.896
FROM THE PROPOSAL THE ADDITIONAL

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:14.863
STATE BENEFIT MIGHT BE A

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.331
WINDFALL TAX BENEFIT FOR THEM IF

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:17.299
THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE THAT

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:18.500
INVESTMENT ANYWAY --

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:20.269
HOWEVER WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.671
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DESCRIBING --

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:25.340
THE DETAILS OF THAT PROPOSAL

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.543
THAT AT THIS TIME --

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:29.044
THAT SAID THE GOVERNOR'S

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:29.745
INDICATED THEY'D LIKE THE

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:31.313
PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SOME

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.282
INCENTIVE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:34.817
INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN GREEN

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.819
TECHNOLOGY.

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:40.589
JOBS THE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:41.523
WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE'S

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.559
A VARIETY OF WAYS FOR THE STATE

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.060
TO ENCOURAGE SUCH INVESTMENTS.

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:47.863
AND IT'S NOT OBVIOUS TO US HOW --

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.598
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WOULD BE MORE

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:50.933
EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER APPROACHES

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.735
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.403
FOR TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT --

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.771
THE REMAINING ITEMS ON THE LIST

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:56.638
HAVE --

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.173
RELATIVELY SMALLER FISCAL

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.409
EFFECTS AND MANY OF THEM WERE

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.177
RECENTLY ADDED SO WE WE HAVEN'T

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:04.680
REALLY DONE ON AN IN DEPTH

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.682
ASSESSMENT OF THEM --

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:09.218
BUT FOR ALL THEY LOOK --

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:10.352
LIKE THEY WOULD MAKE MEANINGFUL

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.020
IMPROVEMENTS THE SIMPLICITY THE

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:14.323
STATE TAX CODE INNOCENTLY WORTHY

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:16.225
OF CONSIDERATION --

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:17.993
IN CONCLUSION WE WANT TO CAUTION

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.428
THAT THE FISCAL ESTIMATES

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:21.330
PRESENTED HERE ARE HIGHLY

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.297
UNCERTAIN.

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.433
LARGELY BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.067
THE FEDERAL ESTIMATES TO VOTE BY

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:28.670
THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.105
AND THEN ADJUSTED FOR FOR

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.007
CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION THERE'S

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.376
GOING TO BE TAX PAYER --

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.011
CHANGES IN TAXPAYER BEHAVIORS

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:36.745
THAT COULD --

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.013
LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.915
UNCERTAINTY ILLUSTRATING THIS

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:42.317
THE THE FISCAL ESTIMATES AND AND

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:43.519
OUR TABLE ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:46.021
THAN THOSE PRESENTED ON BUT THE

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.356
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:48.490
AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH --

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.425
SOME DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:52.528
HOW TAXPAYERS HOW THAT PROPOSALS

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:54.062
WILL BE -- I

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.097
I'VE I BELIEVE THAT JUST IT

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.565
DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.200
GO INTO THOSE AND KIND OF

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.067
ILLUSTRATES THAT IT'S HARD TO

01:13:59.134 --> 01:13:59.802
TARGET.

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:01.503
A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT --

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:02.805
ACCURATELY.

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:04.373
AND SO WE SUGGEST THAT YOU

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:06.475
CONSIDER THE ATC PROPOSAL

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.643
INDEPENDENTLY FROM WHETHER OR

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.444
NOT TO CONFORM TO ANY THE

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:10.512
FEDERAL TAX CHANGES.

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:22.357
OTHER OF THE MAJOR CHANGES MADE

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:23.725

COORDINATION WORK.

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:27.422
I KNOW THAT THE OPPORTUNITY THE

OPPORTUNITY SO WE WOULD BE

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.775

AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT SO

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:03.458
IT'S A BIG TICKET ITEM.

01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:04.927

DESCRIPTION ABOUT IT SO JUST

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.696
LOVE TO LEARN MORE I THINK

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:09.598
THERE'S A LOT OF LOT OF

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:09.898
QUESTIONS.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:10.999
THROUGHOUT THIS MAN AND WHAT

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.434
EXACTLY IS MEANT BY THIS IN AND

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:13.802
WE ARE WE'RE WORKING OUT WITH

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:15.037
THE OBVIOUSLY THE WHAT'S THE

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:16.338
DEFINITION OF LOCALES WHO WERE

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.773
WORKING ON THAT --

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.141
AS WELLS DEFINITION OF GREEN

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.609
TECHNOLOGY --

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:22.244
SO WE'RE WORKING ON THOSE THINGS

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:23.912
THEY HOPE TO HAVE SOME TEA SOON

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:26.081
COME BUT I THINK OF I THINK THE

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:27.683
MODEL WE MAY BE LOOKING AT WOULD

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.084
BE LOOKING FOR THE LOW INCOME

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:30.185
HOUSING.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.520
IS THAT IT WOULD --

01:16:31.586 --> 01:16:33.755
MATCH WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE LOW

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:35.057
INCOME HOUSING TAX WOULD HAVE

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.591
THE SAME SORT OF STRUCTURE IN

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.794
PLACE THEREFORE VERIFYING THAT

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:43.632
THE THAT THE MONEY IF IT IF IT'S

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:46.568
QUICK LOOKING FOR TO GIVEN IT'S

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:48.270
SUCH A HUGE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:49.838
ITS.

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:51.173
WITH VERY LITTLE INFORMATION AND

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:53.075
I DO KNOW THE GOVERNOR PLIGHT I

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:53.976
UNDERSTOOD THE GOVERNOR WAS

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:54.943
GOING TO PUT OUT A PROPOSAL

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.011
AROUND THE INTERSECTION OF THE

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:57.279
I. FDA'S WITH OPPORTUNITY SOUNDS

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:58.714
AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.182
SURE IF THIS IS IT.

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:01.650
YEAH I'D BE SOMETHING ELSE YEAH

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.251
I'M I'M I'M ACTUALLY NOT

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:04.886
FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE OKAY SO

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.121
IF WE COULD GET A BRIEFING ON

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:06.922
THAT THAT CERTAINLY.

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:08.256
AND AND JUST --

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:12.661
TO CLARIFY THAT REVENUE ESTIMATE.

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:13.295
IS -- IT HAS

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:14.730
NOT BEEN PROPERLY SCALED DOWN SO

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.465
PRESUMABLY THE REVENUES GOOD

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:17.899

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:20.102
CONFORMITY WITHOUT.

TECHNOLOGY THAT SORT OF THING.

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:30.379
SO THE REVENUE WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:31.480
LOWER THAN THIS.

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:33.181
ONCE WE PUT IN THOSE LIMITATIONS

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:34.716

OTHER IDEAS THAT YOU THOUGHT

BACK OF THE REPORT THE PROPOSAL

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:14.649

WAS MENTIONING EARLIER TO EXT

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:19.488

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:21.389
RANGE OF THE THE CREDIT SO THAT

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:22.757
YOU HAVE YEAH BASICALLY YOU GET

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:24.292
JUST GIVE A BIGGER CREDITS FOR A

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:26.128
LOT OF ENTER YOUR THAT WITH THE

01:19:26.194 --> 01:19:28.797
GRAPH WHICH IS MAKES IT EASY TO

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:29.464
UNDERSTAND HIS.

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.199
OR EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IS ON

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.068
PAGE.

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:33.668
TEN AND SO THAT REALLY KIND OF

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:34.636
IT.

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.271
SORT OF VISUALLY DESCRIBES WHAT

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:38.406
IT DOES --

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.308
FOR THAT'S FOR A HOUSEHOLD WITH

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:42.144
TWO DEPENDENTS FOR A HOUSEHOLD

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:43.979
WITH ONE DEPENDENT.

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:44.846
IT WOULD.

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:46.648
THE GRAPH ITSELF WOULD LOOK THE

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:47.716
SAME BUT IT WOULD BE SHE WOULD

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:49.885
BE SCALED DOWN SO IT WOULD

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.853
BECOME AT A LOWER.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.989
INCOME RANGE --

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:54.823
FOR THREE DEPENDENTS IT'S

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.291
ROUGHLY THE SAME AS WITH TWO

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:59.127
DEPENDENTS IS THERE A LOWER COST

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:01.229
OR HIGHER COST WE TRIED TO SET

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:02.564
THIS UP SO THE COST OF THAT

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.533
PROPOSAL WOULD BE SIMILAR TO

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:06.134
WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING.

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:07.836
NOW ONE THING OUR PROPOSAL DOES

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:09.604
NOT INCLUDE IS IT IT DOESN'T

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:11.606
HAVE THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.074
FOR P. FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH AT

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:15.810
LEAST ONE KID UNDER THE AGE OF

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:16.611
SIX SO BASICALLY WE TOOK THAT

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:17.546
WHOLE.

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:18.547
ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:22.551
DOLLARS IN SEE HOW FAR IT UP WE

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:23.385
COULD PUSH.

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:28.590
THE THE THE MAXIMUM EITC AMOUNT

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:31.493
AND SO IS IS IT AS IT TURNED OUT.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.961
WE THINK THAT YOU COULD INCREASE

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:36.097
THE AMOUNTS BY 42% FOR ALL TYPES

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.732
OF FILERS.

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:40.235
AND THAT WOULD A NO COST ROUGHLY

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:41.870
SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:43.538
IN AND SO THE AYE THE IDEA IS TO

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:44.906
TRY TO GET.

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:45.941
WELL TO AN INCOME LEVEL OF

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:49.978
ROUGHLY. TWENTY THOUSAND WHO

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:51.279
WHAT WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:52.013
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.349
OF VIEW IDC'S TRY TO GET THEM TO

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:55.784
A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF INCOME.

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.819
WELL IT THE WHOLE I GUESS THE IT

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:59.054
HAS THEIR DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.290
AT THE A. T. C. HAS AND SO.

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:04.593
THE THE OBJECTIVE OF A PROPOSAL

01:21:04.659 --> 01:21:06.861
LIKE THIS WOULD BE --

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:08.330
TO TRY TO DRAW MORE PEOPLE INTO

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:09.764
THE WORK FORCE AND TO PROVIDE

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:11.866
BIGGER BOOST FOR PEOPLE SORT OF

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:14.469
IN THE TEN TO TWENTY TWENTY

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.337
THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME RANGER

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:17.472
MAY BE SLIGHTLY LOWER IF THEY

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:20.775
ONLY HAVE ONE DEPENDENT.

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:21.643
AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT BOTH

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.411
PROPOSALS DUE THAT FORMS ARE

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:24.279
JUST -- THE

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:25.847
VOTE THEIR ALTERNATIVE THAT WE

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:27.415
DESCRIBE WOULD HAVE MORE OF AN

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:29.851
IMPACT ON THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:31.720
PROPOSAL WOULD YOU KNOW.

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.655
TARGET BENEFITS FOR FIRST OF ALL

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.090
THE PEOPLE WITH KIDS UNDER AGE

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:36.324
SIX WOULD EACH GET THAT FIVE

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:38.159
HUNDRED DOLLARS AND SECOND.

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:41.196
PEOPLE GENERALLY BETWEEN --

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:43.231
SAY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:44.065
DOLLARS OF INCOME WOULD

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:45.066
TYPICALLY SEE THE BIGGEST

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:47.869
INCREASES.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.371
IN AND WHY WHY WOULD --

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:50.205
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.640
WOULD DROP PEOPLE INTO THE

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:53.241
WORKFORCE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:55.677

IN PARTICULAR.

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.053
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.154
THAT WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE FOR

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.422
PEOPLE TO COME IN.

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.391
YEAH THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:10.659
THE I. T. C. --

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:12.861
