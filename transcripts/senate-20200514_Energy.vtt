THE REST OF. THE BILL IS

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.674
WRITTEN RATE NEUTRAL IT HAS NO

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.677
LANGUAGE- GIVEN ANY AUTHORITY

FOR- THESE PROGRAMS SO THERE

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:32.727
THERE HAS BEEN- A SURPLUS OF

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.630
FUNDS IN THIS PROGRAM FOR MANY

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:38.633

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:45.273

WE REALLY NEED THESE FUNDS TO

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.611
IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SO

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:52.213
WHEN THEY SPEAK OF THIS BILL

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.949
CAUSING PRESSURE. I DON'T KNOW

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:57.085
THAT- IT'S ANY MORE PRESSURE

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:59.654

IN THIS. HI A UNIVERSE FROM

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:06.261
THIS AREA- I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:07.996
THIS BILL INCREASES PRESSURE IT

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:09.597
IT'S SIMPLY ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.566
TO QUALIFY- BUT THERE IS NO

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:12.534
PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.369
ALLOWS FOR RATES INCREASE I

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:16.237
TOOK THIS ON- THE THIS BILL ON

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:18.840
WHAT THE- THE SOLE CONDITION

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:20.575
THAT IT WOULD NOT RESULT. IN A

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:23.044
RATE INCREASE BUT I DO SEE THE

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:25.079
NEED TO GET THIS MONEY INTO OUR

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:26.848
COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY NOW. WHEN

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:29.651
WE HAVE A ECONOMIC CRISIS

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.519
SITUATION OUR STATE AND SOME OF

HISTORY- GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:39.327
WORK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:41.195
IMPORTANT BUT ALSO TRANSFERRING

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.664
THAT WORK IN A SAVINGS REPAIRS

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:46.000
IS GOING TO BE. SO IN THIS

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:47.735
PROCESS. I WOULD TO TELL THE

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:49.904
OPPOSITE JIM THIS BILL IS NOT

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:51.205
INTENDED TO INCREASE RATES

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:53.308
THERE'S NO PROVISION IN IT THAT

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.742
WOULD INCREASE RATES. IF YOU

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:56.678
LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:26:56.744 --> 01:27:00.281

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.584
TO INCREASE RATES SHOULD THE

THE BILL SO- I DON'T THINK AND

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.962
I HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T RESULT.

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:15.797
IN AN INCREASE RATES EVEN IF
