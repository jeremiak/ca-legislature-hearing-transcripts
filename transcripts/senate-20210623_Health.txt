SIR OKAY WELL THANK YOU- PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR- AND SENATORS AGREE TO SEE% EVERYBODY'S UP AND WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR OTHER ENGAGEMENTS AND AS A- THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL AND- AS WE ALL KNOW- MISTER CHAIR- YOU'LL WILDFIRES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF LIFE HERE. IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW AS- OUR STATE BRACES FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER- A DEVASTATING FIRE SEASON NO RECENT WILDFIRES AS TO SIX HAVE BEEN STAGGERING- A RECENTLY PUBLISHED A WILDFIRE SMOKE STUDY FOUND THAT TINY PARTICLES RELEASED IN WILDFIRE SMOKE OR UP TO TEN TIMES. MORE HARMFUL TO HUMANS. ARTICLES RELEASE FROM OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS CAR EXHAUST FACTORIES OR- OUR PLANTS YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO REMEMBER THE WILDFIRE CONDITIONS FROM LAST YEAR AND FROM PRIOR YEARS WHEN SKIES WERE ORANGE THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH TXIC LEVELS OF SMOKE. AND CALIFORNIANS WELL WE WERE ADVISED TO STAY INDOORS TO AVOID OUTDOOR ACTIVITY. AND WHILE MANY OF US HAVE THE LUXURY TO SHELTER INDOORS OUR FARM AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS REMAIN OUTDOORS AND SMOKY FIELDS IN ORCHARDS. TO PICK CROPS THAT HELP FEED CALIFORNIA AND OUR COUNTRY. SO THIS LEGISLATION SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE SIX TO BUILD ON CAL OR OSHA'S STANDARDS FOR PROTECTING FARMING AGRICULTURAL WORKERS FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE AN UNHEALTHY AIR QUALITY CONDITIONS. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE HAVING THIS FIRST IN THE NATION EMERGENCY WILDFIRE SMOKE STANDARD. MANY FARMING AGRICULTURE WORKERS DIDN'T GET TO THE WORKPLACE PROTECTION THEY NEEDED LAST YEAR. YOU KNOW THE COMBINATION OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF WILDFIRES. THEY PUT AN ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE AVAILABILITY OF PPP AND MADE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCURE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF THE RECOMMENDED N. NINETY FIVE MASKS FOR. WORKERS AND FOR THE WORK FORCE. SO THIS LEGISLATION PROPOSES TO FIRST ENSURE THAT THE STATE STOCKPILE OF N. NINETY FIVE MASK WILL BE UTILIZING MADE AVAILABLE. TO OUR FARM NEGLIGENT WORKERS IT WOULD- INSURE THAT WE DIRECTED THE FORMATION IN AND OUT OF DEPLOYMENT OF CAL OSHA WILDFIRE RESPONSE STRIKE TEAMS DURING MAJOR UNHEALTHY AIR QUALITY EVENTS. AND FINALLY WOODCOCK TELLS YOU TO- TO WORK ON- THAT PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT WILDFIRE SMOKE SAFETY EDUCATION MATERIALS AND TRAINING FOR ALL PHARMACOLOGIC WORKERS YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF UNHEALTHY AIR QUALITY DAYS CONTINUE TO INCREASE ANNUALLY HERE IN OUR STATE- AND I SHOULD NOTE IN OUR FIRST IN THE NATION. AGRICULTURAL STATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T STAND FOR A FORMER AGRICULTURE WORKERS TO RESTORE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. EVERY TIME THEY GO INTO THE FIELDS TO HARVEST THE FOOD THAT WE ALL NEED TO RESPECT US WHEN I VOTE. AND MISTER CHAIR- WELL WE DO HAVE TO THAT. WILL BE. PROVIDES INTO.

FEDERAL RECORD RICHARD HERRING. AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH. WE LIVE IN A STATE. WHERE WE HAVE AN ESTIMATED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FARMWORKERS. ANYWHERE MAYBE MORE THAN HALF OF THESE ARE UNDOCUMENTED. IT IS A POPULATION THAT DURING THE CALL THE DEFENDER MADE WAS HEAVILY EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS. WHILE MAINTAINING OUR FOOD SUPPLY. THEY WERE NOT JUST A SENSUAL LABOR FORCE. THEY'RE ALMOST BECAME A SACRIFICIAL LABOR FORCE. TODAY WE LIVE IN THE HISTORICAL PERIOD WHERE WE ARE EXPERIENCING AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE. IN WILDFIRE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY CAUSING DAMAGES ON THE MAGNITUDE NOT. SEEN BEFORE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT HAS BEEN REFERRED FOR USE THAT YOU RETURN QUALITY. THE ONE CENTURY FIRE EVER WAS SEVEN POINT THREE FIVE PER YEAR. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALONE THEY HAD SIXTY NINE FIRES. THE FARM WORKERS FACE A SITUATION TODAY WHERE THE WILDFIRE SMOKE INHALATION IS INEVITABLE. WHEN THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE WORKING AND BEING EXPOSED. TO HEAVY SMOKE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PROTECTION. THIS IS BRINGING A GREATER NUMBER OF HEALTH RISKS FOR FARMERS THE CHEMICALS FOUND SMOKE GET THE POSITIVE IN THE SOIL AND BOLSTERING THE WATER. THE INSTALLATION OF MOKE MAY BRING ABOUT PULMONARY DISEASES CARDIOVASCULAR ILLNESSES AT AN EXACERBATIONS OF ASTHMA. BUT HE BELIEVES THE RISKS INCLUDE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT MIGHT BE CONTAINED IN THE EMISSION OF ASH AND SOIL PARTICLES IT'S DUST DURING AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES. MAYBE SEVENTY THREE OFFERS A SOLUTION TO THE CONDITIONS SUFFERED BY FARM DURING THESE WILDFIRES. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO PLEASE SUPPORT AB SEVENTY THREE SUBMITTED BY ASSEMBLYMAN ROBERT REQUEST WITHIN. FIVE VOTE. THANK YOU.

MILLER FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION WINE GRAPE GROWERS A MODERATOR PLEASE- BRING ON- MICHAEL MILLER- FOR HIS TESTIMONY AND- YOU HAVE- BECAUSE THE OTHERS THAT THE ENTRY HAD FOUR MINUTES YOU HAVE A MAXIMO FOUR MINUTES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOUR MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL MILLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF WINE GRAPE GROWERS AND THAT SUPPORT AND NOTE THAT THE BILL DOES HAVE NO OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE ALL. AGREE WITH WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO DO- WE'VE BEEN VERY SUPPORT OF ALL OF THE- INTEREST AND CONCERN AND A GOAL OF GETTING- AND NINETY FIVE MASK RESPIRATORS. FOR EMPLOYEES IN WILDFIRE SMOKE SITUATIONS- AND WE CAN CONTINUE THAT LAST YEAR WE HAD A BIG LESSON LEARNED WHEN THOSE MAPS WERE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO COLD. AND MISTY HAD TO READ THIS MASK FROM THE ESTATE STOCKPILE AND DISTRIBUTED THOSE TO THE COUNTER WHAT SORT OF- COMMISSIONS TO THE EMPLOYERS YOU GOT THEM THEY HAD TO REPLACE RIGHT AWAY AND THAT THAT WORK VERY WELL. ON THAT WE SUPPORT THE- THE AFTERNOON. I WANT TO GIVE A STAFF OR- PARAGRAPH ABOUT OTHER ARE NOT. THAT PART OF THE BOTTOM OF PAGE-BY. A VERY VERY ACTUALLY CARE. OUR CONCERNS THE DELL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M JUST ONE PARAGRAPH HIGHER PARAGRAPHS SIX OF THE BOTTOM OF EACH FIVE. THE SUPPORT AMENDED I THINK THAT PARAGRAPH HIGHLIGHTS THE- THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT THERE SIMPLY SHOULD YOU MEET A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT. ALL THIS THIS- REGULATIONS WORKS. THE CALIFORNIA OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS BOARD. APPROVED A REGULATION FROM OPERATIONAL PROTECTION. THE REGULATION REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO NOTIFY AMAZON EMPLOYEES WHEN THERE'S A WILDFIRE SMOKE SITUATION. AND TO PROVIDE THEM N. NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS VOLUNTEER YEARS TO PROTECT THEM FROM SMOKE EXPOSURE. THAT REGULATIONS IN EFFECT AS BEING FORCED BY CAL OSHA. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES BECAUSE IT IS WORKING- SO WE THE NUMBERS ARE SUGGESTING ARE TO KEEP IT CONSISTENT. WITH THAT REGULATION. AFTER DECADES. WHAT YOU MAY. A LITTLE WE- THE BOARDS DOWN THAT IS APPROVED AND THEN YOU HAVE A NEW LAW COMING IN BEHIND IT YOU TRY TO. YOU KNOW I'LL PROVIDE THE NEED TO COMPLY WITH THAT STANDARD THE BIG FADING AT VIRTUALLY OTHER REQUIREMENTS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THAT STANDARD SO. WHAT WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET AT IS LET'S MAKE IT CONSISTENT WITH THAT STANDARD. ABOUT HOW THE TRAINING WORKS A MASTER PROVIDED AND MAKE SURE THAT THE- THAT THE PROGRAM. WORKS WITH THE GOAL OF GETTING THE N. NINETY FIVE MASKS TO EMPLOYEES. IS THAT PROGRAM IS- GETS DOWN UNDER EXISTING LAW HOW ALL WORKPLACE STANDARDS ARE ADOPTED AND ENFORCED. AND THAT SHOULD CONTINUE AND SOME SORT OF MAKE SURE. THAT THAT THAT IS NOT IMPORTANTLY- I'M DONE BY THIS BILL AGAIN WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. YOU WORKING WITH COMMITTEES ARE STAFFED WITH THE OFFICE STAFF WILL HAPPEN THAT WILL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THESE CONCERTS. AND VERY APPRECIATIVE OF HIM TAKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND- WITH THE PICTURES OFF THE ABILITY WILL GET SUPPORT ON THE BILL BECAUSE WE DO VERY MUCH SUPPORT.

THANK YOU LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. IT'LL BE JUST A MOMENT FOR FIRST LINE THANK YOU. ONE ONE OH THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RICHARD RIVERA I'M WITH SOCIAL EQUITY LA AND- WE'D LIKE TO OPPOSE. THE BILL AND THAT CEMENTED THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH- NEXT LINE. THERE ARE NO OTHER LINES NOT POSITION PLEASE CONTINUE RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH LET'S BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CENTER GROVE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO HAVE A COME A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR. AND FIRST I APPLIED YOUR BILL I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE EXISTING M. P. B. E. THAT'S AVAILABLE IN A STOCKPILE. AND TO PROTECT OUR FARM WORKERS WHO BRING OUR FOOD TO THE TABLE AT THE CENTER VALLEY IS BLESSED TO. HAVE MANY FARM WORKERS AND MANY PEOPLE THAT- PRODUCE FOOD ACTUALLY OF BUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD SO- I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES ARE STOCKED IN SHARES IN THAT. AND- THAT BLESSING AS WELL. BUT WE ALL REMEMBER I GUESS- WHEN COLBERT STARTED THE BILLION DOLLAR MASS DEAL- THE NATION STATE TRYING TO FIGHT AND- OTHER YOU KNOW ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA THE GOVERNOR WAS ACTUALLY COMPETING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THAT'S WHY HE REFERENCED CALIFORNIA'S A NATION STATE. WITH THE AMOUNT OF THEM. B. E. THAT HE WOULD BE ACQUIRING FROM DIFFERENT NATIONS SPECIFICALLY I BELIEVE CHINA- BUT- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF WE HAVE TO STOCKPILE NOW AND T IS AN IN IT AVAILABLE TO US AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR WHEREVER IT'S AT. AND WE HAVE A RISE IN THE PANDEMIC AGAIN AND WE NEED THESE N. NINETY FIVE MASKS FOR FRONTLINE WORKERS LIKE NURSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT- HOSPITALS WHICH WE WERE STRUGGLING TO GET. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. DOES YOUR BILL TAKE IT DOWN TO ZERO AND DEPLETED TO NOTHING OR DO WE LEAVE SOME THERE JUST IN CASE WE HAVE A- A RISE IN THE PANDEMIC AGAIN WE NEED ACCESS TO THOSE TYPES OF. THAT TYPE OF PP- OR- DO YOU DOES YOUR BILL REFERENCE IT AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO READ THE WHOLE THING MEASURES QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP AS I READ THE ANALYSIS. YES SO I- APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS IN YOU KNOW ARE HAPPY TO- INSURE THAT. WE PROVIDE SOME FOLLOW UP BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AS THE BILL STIPULATES YOU KNOW. REQUIRING THE CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THESE THESE THESE EXISTING AGENCIES THAT HANDLE THE STOCKPILE- AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY HOPE THAT- YOU KNOW WE CAN WORK TO. ENSURE THAT WE CLARIFY THAT- THE DEPARTMENT FOOD NAG BE INVOLVED AS WELL- BUT BUT CERTAINLY IN THE BILL IT DOES- TATING THAT. THAT YOU KNOW RICKY- THE YELP REVIEW. REQUIRING A REPORT FROM. FROM- THE DEPARTMENT OF- OF- STATE PUBLIC HEALTH WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS BILL WITH REGARD TO THE AMOUNT OF P. P. IN. THE STOCKPILE. THE AMOUNT OF TV FROM THE STOCKPILE THAT HAS BEEN USED AND THE AMOUNT OF- ANTICIPATED FUTURE USAGE- AND YOU KNOW AND SO I WOULD- YOU KNOW- BE HAPPY TO. DO SOME FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW WE ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC CONCERN. MA'AM SENATOR. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID I REALLY LIKE THE BILL I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE STILL WORKING THAT NEED- YOU KNOW WHEN. YOU'RE IN A HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREA OR THE SMOKE GOES DOWN TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM THE NORTH. AND WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE PROTECTED I GUESS. MY CONCERN WHICH  RELATE TO YOU IS- IN THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC THAT TERM WE WERE ALL SCRAMBLING TO GET MASK AND- PP. F. FOR EVERYONE AND SO I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD. DEPLETE ZERO R. STOCKPILE. BUT YOUR FOLLOW UP- ON THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL AND I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT. MY SECOND. QUESTION THAT I HAVE FOR YOU. AND AN IS THAT ONCE WE- SEE IT'S- I DON'T KNOW FIFTY PER. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS BUT JUST SAY IT'S FIFTY PERCENT. WHEN WE REACH THAT AND THERE'S NO MORE THAN 50% AVAILABLE IN THE STOCKPILE OR WHATEVER NUMBER YOU DEAN. AND SUITABLE FOR THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T GO BELOW THAT IN THE STOCKPILE. AND IT STILL REQUIRED BY LAW. IF IT'S NOT IN YOUR BILL IF IT'S NOT- PROVIDED FOR BY DEPARTMENT OF IT AT C. P. H. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WHO PROVIDES THAT IS A TEAM PLAYER THAT WOULD PROVIDE IT AFTER THE STOCKPILE IS DEPLETED TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE POINT OR- HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE PROVIDED FOR THESE MASK AFTER THAT STOCKPILE. IS DEPLETED SURE SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT- STATE STANDARD OF YOU KNOW WILDFIRE SMOKE- STANDARD THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. JUST PART OF THE PANDEMIC. IT IS- THE EMPLOYER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO- INSURE THAT THEY ARE THAT. THEY ARE PROVIDING THIS BP IN PARTICULAR AND I FIVE MASTED PLAYERS AND AS YOU STATED IN. A SENATOR YOU KNOW THE ABILITY FOR THE INDUSTRY TO. PROCURE THESE MASKS WERE. IMPOSSIBLE AS THE- THE AMOUNT OF CHARGES THAT ARE STATED IN AN IN COUNTRY FACED. AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO KNOW I MEAN I KNOW OF THE FARMERS IN OUR AREA PROVIDE P. PT PP TO THEIR PLAYERS AND IT'S REQUIRED BY CAL OSHA. BUT WHEN IT'S NOT AVAILABLE AT ALL I MEAN THEY WERE SCRAMBLING TRYING TO PROVIDE PP SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE FOURTH THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD AND THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS MASSIVE STOCKPILE. AND THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU TO FOLLOW UP WITH ME AND I THINK EVERYBODY I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY BUT I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE ON EVERYBODY'S MIND IS THAT. THAT WE- NOT DEPLETE COMPLETELY THE STOCKPILE THAT WE HAVE JUST IN CASE WE COME INTO ANOTHER AND COOK IT SITUATION AND THEN IN THE NEXT YEAR TO YEAR SO IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THAT AVAILABLE- SO THAT WE'RE NOT FRANTICALLY. COMPLETING COMPETING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO- REPLENISH WHAT WE'VE USED. IN THIS BILL- SO THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME ASK YOU THOSE QUESTIONS. AND THEY HAVE A QUESTIONS BE SURE TO. RIGHT UNDER THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. SEEING NONE OF THE THIRTY FIRST OF ALL- THANK YOU SO MUCH SUMMER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THAT SAY ALRIGHT I'M I'M I PERHAPS GOING TO PARTIALLY ADDRESS HOPEFULLY THE QUESTIONS OF MY GOOD FRIEND FROM BAKER STILL DOESN'T GROW. UP BECAUSE AS THE AUTHOR WITH US OUR LABOR OF THE ORIGINAL STOCKPILE BUILD. IT DOWN HERE IS THAT THE STOCKPILE OBVIOUSLY IN A LARGE EVENT LIKE COVE IT EVEN IN TRYING NEVER GOT WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A STOCKPILE ENOUGH. TO AVOID THAT HOWEVER. FOR THE PURPOSES HOUSE ACTUALLY THE BUFFER IN TO BUY TIME RATES BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. IN AN IMMEDIATE CRUNCH OF COURSE THERE'S VERY LITTLE PP AVAILABLE SO PRICES GO SKY HIGH IT'S AN ACCESSIBLE YOU KNOW YOU'RE POTENTIALLY AT RISK FROM- PREDATORY SELLERS WHO EITHER DON'T CARRY THROUGH OUR- SUPPLY SUBSTANDARD PRODUCT. SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE STOCKPILES THE SHARES AT LEAST FOR A PERIOD OF TIME YOU DO HAVE ACCESS TO. HIGHER COURT YOU KNOW. TO THE DVD THAT IS. THAT WAS PURCHASED AT WHEN THINGS WORK TO ADDRESS SUCH A HIGH PRICE ND SO FORTH AND- SO I THAT'S HOW I VIEW THE STOCKPILE HAPPENING. IS THE OBVIOUSLY IN A LARGE PANDEMIC SITUATION IT WOULD BUY SOME TIME ALLOWS YOU TO RE ESTABLISH SUPPLIES CHAINS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF IT. I WOULD THINK THAT IN A WILDFIRE SITUATION WHERE. THERE MAY NOT BE A WORLDWIDE SHORTAGE OR EVEN A NATIONWIDE SHORTAGE OF PP WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE STATE WOULD. MAKE THE STOCKPILE OF SALEABLE- THE MAY MAKE AVAILABLE AT COST- RIGHT SO THAT'S A LOWER COST NOT EDDIE YOU KNOW A CRUNCH CLASS. BUT THEN ALSO OF COURSE AS SOON AS WE'RE ABLE TO. SECURE ADDITIONAL PP START PURCHASING IT IN MASS TO RE- RESTOCK THE STOCKPILES RIGHT. HOWEVER IF IT'S IN A CRUNCH SITUATION AT LEAST WE BOUGHT SOME TIME SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHASE DOWN AND HAVING TO IMMEDIATELY BITE BECAUSE OF THE IMMEDIATE NEED- PP THAT IS EITHER UNAVALABLE OR JUST SKY HIGH PRICES. RIGHT SO THAT I THINK IS THE PURPOSE OF THE STOCKPILE AND THAT CERTAINLY WOULD I THINK HELP EMPLOYERS BECAUSE IF THERE IS A LOCAL SORT OF SHORTAGE. THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO FIND IT AND THEN HAVING TO BUY IT WHATEVER PRICE I WAS WILLING TO SELL IT FOR INSTEAD THEY CAN RELY ON THE STOCK PILE INTO THE STOCK HOW CAN BE IS A LARGE PURCHASER. EVENTUALLY ABLE TO YOU KNOW- REBUILT YOU KNOW BASICALLY RESUME WHEN PRICES HAVE HAVE SETTLED OBVIOUSLY WITH A VERY LARGE OUTBREAK LIKE TELEVISION- THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CHALLENGE BUT- CERTAINLY I THINK. THAT WE WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT PEOPLE HAD EVEN HAD THE- BE. SUPPLY LINES AND JUST I'LL BE BUYS THE TO READ. SOME OF THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. AT THE TOP YES SENATOR GROWTH. YOUR CHAIR FOR ADDRESSING MY CONCERNS- I DID I SAW IT HERE FROM THE STATE LEVEL AS A LEGISLATOR AND AS A BUSINESS OWNER. I ALSO SAW IT- YOU KNOW JUST TRYING TO OBTAIN PAPER MASK RIGHT. AND YOU CAN GET IN FOR I DON'T KNOW FIFTY CENTS EACH AND TILL. COULD HAPPEN AND THEN THEY WERE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET YOU WERE PAYING FIVE DOLLARS A PIECE. SO IT WAS AND THAT WAS MY CONCERN IS IF WE DEPLETED THIS BUT I APPRECIATE THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT SOLUTION. TO A PROBLEM THAT WE DO HAVE SO THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU BUT I GUESS THAT ONE OTHER GUY I DID HAVE A BRIEF QUESTION FOR YOU- SOME THE NUMBER THAT THE- IT'S NOT REALLY OPPOSITION BUT THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED BY ALSO WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THIS ILL IS AFTER. A SIMILAR PASSES OUT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD GO TO LABOR WHERE I THINK THEY WOULD PROBABLY MORE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT CONCERN BUT- DID YOU WANT JUST ME BRIEFLY RESPOND TO. THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE GREAT GROWERS IN TERMS OF IS THERE ANY CONFLICT WITH THIS BILL WITH EXISTING OSHA GUIDELINES- REGARDING A P. T. E. R. NO IN I- REALLY APPRECIATE- THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED AND WE HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH- THE ASSOCIATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. AND WORK TO GET SOME COMPROMISE LANGUAGE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD- WE BE SUCCESSFUL THIS AFTERNOON. OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- OF WHICH THERE'S. NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE- REALLY. YOU KNOW- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON AND RESPECT THAT FOR FIVE OF THE SUBJECT OKAY. BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE ISIS MOVED UP OKAY THE MOTION THAT MOVE BY CENTER EKMAN THE MOTIONS TO PASS. TO THE COMMITTEE ON SENATE LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT COMMITTEE- CONSULTANT TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL PAN. HI CAN I MELINDA'S. MELINDA'S I EGGMAN. EGGMAN EIGEN SOLACE. GROVE HI GROVE I HER TADO LISA HI LEAVE A I. LI MON ROF FIVE ROTH IRA RUBIO RUBIO I WINNER WINNER I. THE BILLS CURRENTLY EIGHT ZERO HOLD THE LINE CALL RIGHT LET'S NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ONE I SEE SOME MEMBER AGRA CURRY HERE. OKAY LET'S GIVE A MOMENT TO. CLEAN UP THE PODIUM HERE. IT'S A MOBILE MOVING OUT ITEM NUMBER ONE EIGHTY FORTY FIVE BY SUMMER I WOULD HURRY WELCOME. ELLO WELCOME THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT AS AN AUTHOR'S AMENDMENT LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY ISSUE TWO ON PAGE. ELEVEN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DEALING WITH THE CALCULATION OF THC IN HEMP PRODUCTS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. FOR ITS WORK ON THIS MEASURE. MAYBE FORTY FIVE CREATES A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR INDUSTRIAL HEMP PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. IN FOODS BEVERAGES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. IT LIMITS HIM PRODUCTS TO CONTAIN NO MORE THAN THREE TENTHS OF A PERCENT OF THC. REQUIRES THAT HEMP PRODUCTS BE SUBJECT TO TESTING AND LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PRODUCTS. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE FEDERAL FARM BILL CLARIFIED THAT INDUSTRIAL HEMP AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. AND THE FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULES. THIS ACTION CLASSIFIED HIM BEING GREETED AS GENERALLY SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. AND OPEN THE DOORS FOR FARMERS TO CULTIVATE CULTIVATE INDUSTRIAL HEMP. CALIFORNIA LEGALIZED CANNABIS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NOTWITHSTANDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S POSITION THAT CANNABIS IS ILLEGAL. IRONICALLY WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS REMOVED BARRIERS TO THE LEGAL USE OF HEMP DERIVED PRODUCTS INCLUDING CBD. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT TAKEN A SIMILAR APPROACH. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ALLOWS THE MANUFACTURING AND SALE OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA PRODUCTS INCLUDING FOOD AND DRINKS YOU DON'T WANT HIM IS THE SOURCE OF CBD TO BE ADDED TO FOOD PRODUCTS IT IS PROHIBITED. MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PERCHING HIM DRIVE CBD PRODUCTS OF THEIR LOCAL NATURAL FOOD SHOPS FITNESS CENTERS AND EVEN HIGH END DEPARTMENT STORES FOR SOME TIME. THESE PRODUCTS ARE UNREGULATED IN FACT SENIORS HAVE PART A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE PEOPLE CHOOSING TO USE HEMP CBD BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO VISIT A MARIJUANA DISPENSARY. THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF CBD DERIVED FROM HEMP IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. SHOULD THE CHANGE SEES ME SHOULD THE STATE CHOOSE NOT TO CLARIFY THAT HEMP CBD PRODUCTS ARE ILLEGAL FOR SALE IN CONCEPTION. BUSINESSES AND THE TAX REVENUES ARE LOST. WE SIMPLY HAVE A WILD WILD WEST FOR CBD PRODUCTS NOW ONLINE AND IN STORES AND WITH ONLY SELLING ON REGULATED PRODUCTS. I DON'T WANT MY CONSTITUENTS BUYING UNTESTED UNREGULATED AND OUT OF STATE FOR FOREIGN PRODUCTS. ARE UNSAFE FOR FARMERS AND BUSINESSES LOSE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY A. B. FORTY FIVE WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ACCESS THE NON INTOXICATING ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT CONSUMERS WANT. FOR FARMERS TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN A FAST GROWING INDUSTRY. WITH ME TODAY ARE TO TESTIFY OR RANDOM MARTIN HERE IN THE GALLERY REPRESENTING U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE THAT EDDIE BERNACCHI VIA PHONE REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA HIM COUNSEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HIS ARM- AGARI- SO NOW MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES AND SUPPORT SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH- RAN MARTIN FROM THE U. S. I HAVE BROWN TABLE AT THE MICROPHONE AND THE GALLERY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TOTAL. FOUR EARNING IT GOES OFF THE OTHER PERSON'S TIME SO PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AGAIN RANDY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE VERY QUICKLY TO SUMMARIZE WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT NUMBER ONE IT'S GOING TO GIVE ACCESS TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PURCHASE. HIM CBD PRODUCTS- CURRENTLY CAN'T LEGALLY- IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BUY SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE SOME COMFORT WITH RELATIVE TO THE INGREDIENTS THAT THERE'S NOT CONTAMINATION THINGS I THAT. PROVIDES VERY CLEAR SO THE CONSUMER SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS TESTING- TO THE SAME LEVEL AS CANNABIS AND NUMBER THREE IS GOING TO JUMP START AN INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S GOING TO BE A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS. WITH THOUSANDS OF JOBS BEING CREATED. I WANT TO PICK THAT REAL QUICKLY TO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE VERY CLEAR NUMBER ONE THE OPPOSITION HAS SAID THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT INCLUDE CANNABIS LICENSEES. WE WANTED TO INCLUDE CANNABIS LICENSEES JUST AS MUCH AS THEY DO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT WE SHOULD BE- INCLUDING THAT INDUSTRY AS WELL AND THEY CAN'T INDUSTRY- WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE- BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE MORE TIME TO GET TERE. COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IF THE OPPOSITION WOULD ACTUALLY BE WORKING WITH US TO TRY AND GET THE ADMINISTRATION TO AGREE TO INCLUDE CANNABIS LICENSEES AND THEY CAN'T- CAN'T SEE BEAUTY SUPPLY CHAIN- THE OPPOSITION TALKS ABOUT NEEDING TESTING PARITY WITH CANNABIS. SO PAGE FIFTEEN LINE NINETEEN OF THE BILL SAYS TESTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTAMINANT LEVELS SHALL BE THE SAME AS THOSE FOR CAMPUS I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH MORE PARITY WE CAN GET IN THE BILL- THAN. TO SAY THAT IT HAS TO BE THE SAME AS CANNABIS. NUMBER THREE- THEY WANT TO SEE PROBLEM. ON NON MEDICAL CLAIMS THAT CANNABIS HAS TO FOLLOW. THAT IS IN THE BILL IS ALREADY REQUIRED UNDER THE SHERMAN. FOOD DRUG AND COSMETICS ACT. OF VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO WHAT'S IN THE CANNABIS LAW. SO WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM MAKING CLAIMS IT CAN'T B SUBSTANTIATED. THAT'S ALSO GOVERNED BY THE FDA THE FDA IS CLAMPING DOWN WHERE PEOPLE ARE MAKING. UNSUBSTANTIATED MEDICAL CLAIMS. I HOPE THOSE ANSWER THE KEY QUESTIONS FROM THE OPPOSITION- WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR VOTE ON THIS BILL THIS IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO SB TWO THIRTY FIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH NOW LET'S MOVE ON- MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE EDDIE BERNACCHI FROM THE CALIFORNIA HELP COUNSEL WHO'S GOING TO BE DIVIDED DECISIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AND YOU HAVE A MINUTE FIFTY FIVE SECONDS. COMPLAINTS OPEN THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY BERNACCHI MAP THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL- WHICH IS A COALITION. OF CALIFORNIA BASED HIM CULTIVATORS PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS- EIGHTY FORTY FIVE OF THE VITAL MEASURE TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED PROCESS OF THE INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE QUEUE IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WHICH PROHIBITED THE USE OF PEPE DERIVED CANNABINOIDS IN FOODS AND BEVERAGES- OUR INDUSTRY OUR EMERGENCY EMERGING INDUSTRY- THE- SAUCER IS CHILLING EFFECT ACROSS EVERY LEVEL PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF CULTIVATION WHICH LOST SIGNIFICANT OUTLET- FOR THE BIO MASS. AB FORTY FIVE RE AUTHORIZES THE USE OF HEMP IN FOOD AND BEVERAGES AND CANNED BEVERAGE PRODUCTS IN DOING SO CREATE A SIGNIFICANT PATH FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS. TO EXPAND IN IN THE INDUSTRY- IN ADDITION THE BILL CREATES A REGULATORY STRUCTURE PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS RELATED TO HEMP DERIVED PRODUCTS INCLUDING TESTING LABELING AND ENDURANCE TO THE- SHERMAN ACT. AND CURRENTGOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THE ENCOUNTER WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE ROBUST CONSUMER PROTECTION PROVISIONS IN THE BILL.

ONCE THE PRODUCT IT'S PACKAGED AND IT'S READY TO BE CONSUMED BY AN INDIVIDUAL. ROB PRODUCT AND IF YOU TEST IT IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A VERY DIFFERENT RESULT DAN WHEN YOU HAVE A FINAL FORM CONTAMINANTS METALS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH HERE ALSO THERE IS NO AGE THREE AGE LIMIT ON THIS PRODUCT READ PASSING THAT ON TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

THERE'S A WE ASKED FOR AND THEN AND OF TEACHING TWO ZERO ONE FIVE MILLIGRAM. WE HEARD THAT THERE'S NOT. COMING WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT- WE THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE LIMITED- THEN WE HAVE A I TOOK SOME TESTING PAIRED. THE OTHER. COMPONENT IS ALLOWING THE CANNABIS- MANUFACTURES CULTIVATORS MANUFACTURERS RETAILERS TO BE ABLE TO SELL THOSE PRODUCTS. RIGHT NOW. THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS ALREADY DECIMATED SO THIS BILL REALLY CATERS TO OUT OF STATE HELP. MANUFACTURERS PRODUCTS COMING FROM CHINA IN THE LIMITS JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU SENATOR IS- MY NAME IS DR LYNN SILVER I'M A PEDIATRICIAN CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT UCSF AND SENIOR ADVISER AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. A. B. FORTY FIVE IS AN HISTORIC ERROR FOR THE SIMPLEST OF REASONS. FOOD IS FOOD TO BE SAFE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND BABIES IT SHOULD NOT BE ADULTERATED. ADDING NEUROLOGICALLY ACTIVE CANNABINOIDS TO FOOD WITH KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS AND DRUG INTERACTIONS IS A VERY BAD IDEA. A. B. FORTY FIVE UNDERMINES THE OBLIGATION OF GOVERNMENT TO ASSURE A SAFE AND UNADULTERATED FOOD SUPPLY. THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF FDA REGULATION. HAS BEEN THAT APPROVED PHARMACEUTICALS CANNOT BE ADDED TO FOOD OR SOLD THE SUPPLEMENTS GET THIS BILL ALLOWS TO SUCH SUBSTANCES CBD AND THC. INTO FOOD SOLD AT THE CORNER STORE. CBD ITSELF CAN CAUSE SOMNOLENCE SEDATION DIARRHEA LIVER INJURY AND INTERACTS WITH MANY MEDICATIONS INCLUDING BLOOD THINNERS. TWO MINUTES IS INSUFFICIENT TO DESCRIBE ALL THE WAYS THE SPECIAL INTEREST pCURRENTLY SO POORLY DRAFTED THAT IT ALLOWS THE TEACH YOU PREVALENT OF EIGHTY FIVE CANNABIS EDIBLES AND CANNABIS AND BREWED BEER. EVEN WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN. THC EXPOSURE IS NOT FULLY RESOLVED. THE SURGEON GENERAL WARNS THAT EXPOSURE TO CANNABIS IN UTERO DURING CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE. INTERFERES WITH BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BUT WE DO NOT YET FULLY KNOW. WHAT CANNABINOIDS DRIVE THESE EFFECTS THAT HEMP DIFFERS MOSTLY IN THC. ARE THESE THE SNACKS YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO GRAB LUNCH BREAK. FOODS SHOULD NOT REQUIRE LABEL SAYING DON'T EAT UNLESS YOU ARE TWENTY ONE. HOPE IT IS AN EMERGENCY HEMP IS NOT. ITS REGULATION REQUIRES ANALYSIS NOT URGENCY THE BEST PATH IS TO AWAIT FDA REGULATION. OR ALTERNATIVELY TO AUTHORIZE C. PH TO PROPOSE A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. WITHIN TWO TO THREE YEARS BUT A. B. FORTY FIVE PM SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION AND IS MORE HARMFUL THAN HELPFUL- ALLOWING US TO MEDICAL CLAIMS THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED FURTHERMORE PLEASE INCLUDE TO CLOAK HEALTH REGULATION IN SECRECY IS DANGEROUS. MAYBE FORTY FIVE IS DANGEROUS PLEASE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND VOTE NO THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT- NOW MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- SAYING NO ONE ELSE AT THE GALLERY LET'S MOVE TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY. SEEN ON ROUTE TWENTY FORTY MODERATOR.

THIS BILL AS I SUPPORTED THE SIMILAR BILL AND SENATOR ALLEN. PRESENTED IN THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS YEAR AND- THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO TACKLE- ASI MENTIONED IT TO THE AUTHOR OF THE ONE THING. I REQUESTED- TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WITH PARTICULAR THE SMALL- CANNABIS MEDICAL CANNABIS EQUITY- BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR IN SAN FRANCISCO- WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST NETWORK OF THESE SMALL. CANNABIS BUSINESSES INCLUDING- MEDICAL CANNABIS AND WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD- ON THE EQUITY FRONT TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED. BY THE WAR ON DRUGS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND- AND- YOU KNOW BIT. USE CANNABIS CAUSES OF COLOR ARE ABLE TO- ARE ABLE TO SUCCEED. AND IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING WITH LEGALIZATION. OF CANNABIS AND SOME OF THE- FRANKLY PROBLEMSWITH THAT BALLOT MEASURE NOTHING'S PERFECT- THE SORT OF BIT LARGER BUSINESSES COME AND- AND CAN REALLY IMPACT THE SMALL COMMUNITY BUSINESSES. WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD TO TRY TO SHORE UP THESE BUSINESSES- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE AND I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR CONCERNS. THAT THE LARGE LARGE HEMP BUSINESSES COULD COME IN AND POTENTIALLY BIG FIGHT- THE SMALL LOCAL. CANNABIS BUSINESSES AND IT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT- FROZEN SALMON CISCO I KNOW IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE- AUTHOR HAS YOU KNOW INDICATED SHOULD CONTINUE THIS WHOLE- TALK WITH THEM AND TRY TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE. IN THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAINTAINING- THAT REALLY IMPORTANT BALANCE I'LL BE SUPPORTING BOTH TODAY AND I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. AND IF YOU HAVE ANY. COMMENTS ON THAT I WOULD. HAVE TO DO THE COMMENT I HAVE IS THAT ABSOLUTELY I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS. FROM OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERY BILLS PERFECT BUT I WOULD REALLY WANT TO MAKE IT PERFECT SO WE HAVE TO COME BACK AND DO THIS AGAIN. I THINK WE WORKED REALLY HARD WITH THE BOSS FIGHTS BUT I AGAIN I. REALLY WANT TO HONOR PARTICULAR SMALL. I'VE BEEN BECAUSE THEY THE ONES THAT UNDERSTOOD. TAKE IT WOULD TAKE THE HIT SO I TOTALLY. SO I PROMISE YOU WHEN YOU KNOW THEY WILL DO IT I WILL DEFINITELY MEET WITH THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU- CENTER LATER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE OFF IF THAT'S OKAY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS A LOT OF WHAT- THE OPPOSITION IS. BUT THEIR OPPOSITION IS IT CAN NOT FREEZING THAT'S RIGHT AT ALL. THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO REGULATE AN UNREGULATED PORTION OF THIS INDUSTRY YES THANK YOU AND SOME OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS WORRIED ABOUT IS ALREADY HAPPENING YES AND YOUR BILL IS. GOING AFTER THIS IN A SMALL WAY AND HOPEFULLY IN A BIGGER WAY SOON YES AND IT'S BEEN A CONSUMER PROTECTION AS YOU KNOW YOU CAN BUY THIS THIS PRODUCT MOST SO MANY PLACES IT'S JUST AMAZING. AND THERE'S NO IDEA WHAT'S BEEN IF IT'S BEEN TESTED IT'S NOT REGULATED THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE USING A PRODUCT THAT IS. GOOD AND THEN ON TO NOT TO GET SICK SO IT'S ALL ABOUT SAFETY CONSUMER PROTECTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT ANY OTHER- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SO YES SIR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- AND IT HERE AT THE DEBATE AND I'M SENSITIVE TO BOTH SIDES- I DO KNOW THE AUTHOR HOWEVER- HAS EXPRESSED WANTING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS- I HAD CONCERNS WHEN I HEAR ON A DOCTOR TALK ABOUT THE HELP. IT TO CHILDREN AND EXPOSURE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK I WOULD NEED TO TAKE DEEPER TO UNDERSTAND. ME I DID HERE RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT SAFETY AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING BUT I CANNOT HELP BUT- THINK THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND REALLY TALENT INTO SOME OF THAT OPPOSITION AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT SO HOPEFULLY. THAT WILL HAPPEN BUT I WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SO. ASSEMBLYWOMAN I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT- ONE OF THE STATEMENTS HERE IN THE ANALYSIS- G. R. S. WHICH IS THE GETTING IT RIGHT GROUP A PROJECT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE CAP OF POINT 3% THC MEANS THAT A TEN OUNCE BEVERAGE COULD CONTAIN AS MUCH AS EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLIGRAMS OF THC WHICH WOULD BE EIGHTY FIVE TIMES THE LEGALLY ALLOWED DOSE OF THC AND CANNABIS EDIBLE- WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT FOR ME PLEASE FOR CORPORATE RATE ONLY THAT'S TRUE ON MY ONLY TO MY EXPERT WITNESSES OF ABOVE MISTER MARTIN OR MR BERNACCHI K. G. MISTER MARTIN'S COMING UP TO THE MICROPHONE. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU ACCEPTED ALSO TRIED TO DRESS THAT IT RADIATION BUT- REMARKS PLEASE. WELL MISTER JERRY TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY- THE CHAIRMAN OBVIOUSLY IS CONCERNED. ON THAT ISSUE AS WELL AND WE WORKED WITH HE AND HIS STAFF OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. TO COME WITH UP WITH THAT AMENDMENT THAT BASICALLY LIMITS THE EXTRACT THAT GOES INTO THE PRODUCT NOT THE ENTIRE PRODUCT. TO THAT ZERO POINT 3% OF THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE CONCERN HAS BEEN EXPRESSED AS A ZERO POINT THREE WOULD APPLY TO. A TWELVE OUNCE BEVERAGE INSTEAD OF THE HALF AN OUNCE OR SO OF EXTRACTED MY GO TO THE PRODUCT. THIS WILL ONLY APPLY TO THE EXTRACT AND NOT TO THE ENTIRE PRODUCT. TO THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLIGRAMS WILL NEVER FORGET A PRODUCT. SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE I'M SURE ARE LISTENING TO THIS TESTIMONY IF YOU COULD BOIL THAT DOWN INTO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE. UNDERSTANDABLE FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO ISN'T YOU KNOW- A POLICY TYPE OF PERSON PUT IT IN LAYMAN'S TERMS FOR THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING PLEASE. I WILL TRY AS THE LETTER FROM PH II- HELPLINE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A BEVERAGE THAT WOULD HAVE TEN OUNCES OF PRODUCT AND THEN APPLYING THE ZERO POINT THREE AND THEIR CALCULATION WHAT WOULD YOU CALL EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIGRAMS OF THC. BY PUTTING A CAP ON IT AS THE CHAIR HAS REQUESTED WE ARE NOW BOILING DOWN THAT PRODUCT TO JUDGE THE EXTRACT THAT GOES INTO THE PRODUCT TO MAKE IT A HEMP CBD PRODUCTS. AT THAT POINT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT THAT GOES INTO THIS TEN OUNCE BEVERAGE. SO THE ZERO POINT THREE THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE CAPITAL T. H. C. ZERO POINT THREE. APPLIES TO THAT LITTLE BIT OF EXTRACT SO IT DOES NOT APPLY THERE'S NO THC AND THE REST OF THAT. TEN PLUS POUNDS OF- NINE PLUS THOUSANDS OF THE BEVERAGE. SO- IF IT WORKS AGAINST WHAT LITTLE BIT OF THC IS ALREADY AGAIN IN THE PRODUCT. I HOPE THAT WAS MORE CLEAR I'M NOT I'M NOT A SCIENTIST HEY. I WAS NOT THAT CLEAR NO NO THAT THAT THAT'S VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR. EXPLANATION- I. WELL YOU THAT AND LISTEN TO THE- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- THE CONCERNS. ON THE SIDE OF THE OPPOSITION THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WARRANTS- OPPOSITION FOR ME. AND I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT- THE- YOU KNOW THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY HAS- MAKING HAY OVER THE- DANGER THAT THIS MAY POSE TO MINORS. AND ALL THE WHILE THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS TARGETING MINORS- THE- MINERS AREN'T ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN CANNABIS PRODUCTS UNTIL YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE THE CAN'T-MISS INTEREST INDUSTRY IS IN FACT TARGETING MINORS AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'M THE MOM OF FIVE CHILDREN AND SO I SEE IT AND I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SO I DON'T. KNOW THAT IT'S GENUINE TO SUGGEST THAT THE- THE- THEY'RE SO DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HARM THAT THIS MAY CAUSE TWO CHILDREN- I DON'T. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED SO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK U. S. SENATOR'S OFFICE S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE I GOT ON THE FLOOR TODAY AND I THINK MY- FRIENDS FROM LONG BEACH FOR CALLING IN- I KNOW THAT THEY ARE A VERY VERY MUCH A DEEP INTO THIS THIS BILL AND THEY HAVE THEIR VERY STRONG OPINIONS AND I CERTAINLY SHARE A LOT OF THOSE CONCERNS BUT- MY- CONCERNS ARE ALSO WERE RAISED WITH. WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IMAGES FROM SAN FRANCISCO AS WELL AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THESE SMALLER- CANNABIS ENTITIES AND I HOPE SHE CONTINUES TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO DRESSING THE TESTING ISSUE THAT I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW- WHICH SEEMS TO BE THAT THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE- I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS OF YET BUT I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- BUT I WOULD LIKE IT I KNOW. GOOD FAITH EFFORTS SHOULD CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS AND HEAR THE CONCERNS A LOT OF WORK AND CLEAR BACK HOME THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS SEEING NONE- SUMMER I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL- I KNOW WE HAVE TO FIRST OF ALL IT KNOWLEDGE THAT THE VOTERS MADE CLEAR THAT- THEY WANTED- MARIJUANA LEGALIZED IN THE STATE- WHEN IT COMES TO HIM MORE PARTICULARLY UNFORTUNATE WE DON'T HAVE A- FOR REGULATION SO THE. THING IS YOU POINTED OUT- THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN FACT FOR THE PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW AS PETERSON I TOO AM CONCERNED ABOUT EXPOSURE OF CHILDREN- BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT- WITHOUT THIS BILL- THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN FACT THIS BILL PUTS LIMITS ON THAT- MAYBE NOT LIMITS THAT- SOME PEOPLE ARE ENTIRELY- THRILLED WITH BUT I'D ALSO SAY THAT SOME BILLS LIMITS ARE IN THE CONTEXT THE FACT THAT THE VOTERS LEGALIZED. WANT SO WE UNFORTUNATELY WE- WELL FORTUNATE UNFORTUNATELY BASICALLY THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO. BAN THIS ALL TOGETHER PERHAPS- AND- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE GOING AGAINST THE CENTURY THE OVERALL WILL OF THE VOTERS WHEN HE CAME TO THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA ITSELF. SO I THINK THIS IS IN A IN A SENSE IS ALSO AN EMERGENCY BILL- BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST SOME FORM OF REGULATORY. MECHANISM I'LL ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- CERTAINLY. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FDA BUT THE FDA HASN'T ACTED YET AND WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT AS A VACUUM. UNTIL THE FDA ACTS- BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK IN MY PERSPECTIVE TO CHILDREN BEING AFFECTED. I APPRECIATE YOU- WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ABOUT THE I GUESS THE DOSAGE OR EXPOSURE OF WHICH I JUST REMIND IS. IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL STANDARD AND ENSURES THAT NO ONE'S GONNA BE EXPOSED ANYMORE THAN THE FEDERAL STANDARD READIES IN PLACE. AND AND I ALSO APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS CONCERNED ABOUT- SO CERTAINLY I MEAN YOU KNOW. IT'S I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE MOVE FORWARD THIS LEGISLATION. AND WHAT THAT WHICH I LIKE CLOTHES. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS LIKE TAKE THOSE SERIOUSLY AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. LET'S FACE IT. YOU CAN GO TO ANY STORE RIGHT NOW. AND YOU CAN GET THIS PRODUCT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO LABELING ON IT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S ONLY SAFE. FOR SENIOR CITIZENS BUT A FATHER'S THE DECIDE TO USE THIS PRODUCT WHETHER IT'S A CREAM. FOR THOSE. OF THE BEVERAGE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DO SOME REGULATION REGULATION ON. SO WITHOUT MY CLOTHES. AND THEN ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK AND- I. BELIEVE I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE MOTION YET. LOCATED IN BY CENTER ADMIN THE MOTIONS PASSES AMENDED.

GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS AND- BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER I FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF- I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE SPECIFIED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- WHICH SHOULD REMOVE- HOPEFULLY THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WILL CONFIRM THAT THEY'RE REMOVING THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS THIS MEASURE. I'M PRESENTING EIGHTY TWO SEVEN NINE. TO HELP PROTECT NURSING HOME RESIDENTS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THIS MEASURE RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE SAMPLING. WITH SUPPORT FROM THE A. R. P. THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. THIS BILL WILL TEMPORARILY HALT NURSING HOME EVICTIONS AND INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS UNLESS MEDICAL MEDICALLY NECESSARY DURING THIS COVERT STATE OF EMERGENCY. SENIORS LIVING IN NURSING HOMES AS WE ALL KNOW HAVE BEEN AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE TO COME OF IT. IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ALMOST HALF OF ALL DEATHS. DUE TO COVE IT. ACCORDING TO A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE THAT IS REFERENCED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. NURSING HOMES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HAVE BEEN DUMPING THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND HOMELESS SHELTERS AND OTHER UNSAFE FACILITIES DURING THIS PANDEMIC. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIGHER PRIVATE INSURANCE OR MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. HERE IN CALIFORNIA ONE EXAMPLE IS ROCK PORT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHICH MANAGES THE STATE'S LARGEST CHAIN OF FOR PROFIT NURSING HOMES THEY HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY CITED FOR ILLEGAL EVICTIONS. IN LOS ANGELES MY JOIN AUTHOR ON THIS BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO. PRESENTS BOYLE HEIGHTS WHERE. THE COMPANY PACIFICA THE OWNER OF ANOTHER FOR PROFIT NURSING HOME CHAIN STARTED TRANSFERRING RESIDENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAGING PANDEMIC SO THAT THEY CAN CONVERT THE FACILITY INTO LUXURY APARTMENTS. I AM CONTINUING TO WORK. ON AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION. AGAIN I BELIEVE THAT THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I SHOULD BE REMOVING THEIR OPPOSITION. BUT I ASK YOU SENATORS AT THE PLEASE HELP PROTECT VULNERABLE SENIORS DURING THIS PANDEMIC FOR BEING EVICTED OR FOUR FROM SUFFERING TRANSFER TRAUMA. DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BECAUSE FINANCE- SUPPORTERS SAY THE MEASURE TODAY IS- MIKE DARK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. AND FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARNED FOR TINY. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH SUMMER REMEMBER SU CHI AND I LIED AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH MY COMMITTEE AND TAKING THE AMENDMENTS- THAT WE'VE OFFERED SO WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES TESTIFYING SUPPORT I BELIEVE THEY'RE BOTH ON THEY'LL BOTH BE- THROUGH OUR TELEPHONIC LINE SO MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ONLINE MIKE DARK FROM THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM AND WARM FAIR TINY- COMMITTEE MEMBER FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER- CAN PLEASE BRING THEM ON THE LINE AND AGAIN EACH OF YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH MIKE DARK.

A NONPROFIT ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THAT ADVOCATES FOR CALIFORNIANS AND LONG TERM CARE I'M HEARING STRONG SUPPORT FOR ABC. TWO SEVEN NINE. I ASK THAT EACH MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IF IN THE LAST YEAR YOU HAD TO LEAVE YOUR CAREER. YOUR HOME YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. TO LIVE IN A NURSING HOME. HE WOULD HAVE LIVED IN THE LAST YEAR IN NEAR COMPLETE ISOLATION. SEEING PEOPLE DIE ALL AROUND DURING THE PANDEMIC. UNDER CURRENT RULES YOU CAN BE TOLD THAT YOU WILL BE EVEN BIGGER. THIRTY DAYS. EVEN THOUGH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AREN'T EVEN ABLE TO CURSE IT'S A NEW FACILITY THAT MIGHT. BECAUSE OF ONGOING COVERT VISITATION RESTRICTIONS THAT THAT SOUNDS UNFAIR THAT'S BECAUSE IT. IS BROKEN. STATE AND MUNICIPAL THAT EARLY CAN. LOW MANY HELD. WE JUST FILE IT CAN EXTEND TOWARDS ON THE- YESTERDAY. BUT NONE OF THOSE RULES HAVE APPLIED TO THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG. ISOLATED ELDERLY ANDDISABLED PEOPLE LIVING. THERE EIGHTY TWO SEVEN MILLION WOULD REQUIRE THAT ONLY FINANCIALLY HEALTHY FACILITIES. CORPORATE EARLY RESTRICTED FROM UNDERTAKING CERTAIN INVOLUNTARY CONVICTIONS DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. UNLIKE OTHER LANDLORDS SUBJECT TO DEPICTION MORATORIUM HOWEVER UNDER EIGHTY TWO SEVEN NINE USABILITY CAN STILL BE REIMBURSED. UNDER PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAID AND MEDICARE FOR CONTINUING TO HOUSE RESIDENTS. WE URGE YOUR YES CLOSE TO THAT IMPORTANT BUT TEMPORARY. MEASURE TO HELP OUR SENIORS AND DISABLED PEOPLE MAINTAIN SAFE PLACES TO LIVE DURING. THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S NOW BRING ON. SOME WARNED TIME.

SET FOR FINAL DETERMINATION. IF THE PARAMEDICS LICENSES REVOKED IT IS A PROCESS THAT WILL LIKELY LOSE OUR LIVELIHOOD BECAUSE MOST APARTMENTS REQUIRE AN ACTIVE LICENSE AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT.

BEFORE WE SEE THE EXPLOSION OF TELEHEALTH WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO BE PART OF THE FUTURE. ALSO IT'S A GOOD BILL AND ASK FOR AN IPO. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN MAKE THE VETO MY ARTICLE ANOTHER BRIEF CALM BEFORE WE TAKE THE VOTE YEP THIS IS I THINK THE MAN IT'S REALLY ABOUT BEING SO WE DON'T HAVE FURTHER FRAGMENTATION OF CARE. SO AS NOT TO POINT THAT OUT- OKAY THE DATA TO MOVE BY SIR EDMUND THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST THE MAN REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS TO CONSULT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HICAN I. MELINDA'S SEGMENT BY SEGMENT I CAN SOLACE HI AND SO AS I GROW. FURTADO LEYVA. THE MON I. THE MON BY ROSS THANK GROWTH IRA RUBY. HI RUBY I WINNER. WINNER I. OKAY FOR THE CURRENT ROLE IS SEVEN ZERO- AND WILL CALL THE ROLL OPEN BEFORE YOU BEGIN WITH THE NEXT ONE ACTUALLY I HAVE TO RUN OFF THE COMMITTEE SO CENTER ADMIN DO YOU MIND TAKING OVER. SCHERING HERE OKAY. THE I'M VACCINATED I GET FROM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR WE WISH YOU LUCK IN THE COMMITTEE- SENATOR WIENER ARE YOU GOING TO BE FROM DOING THE NEXT BILL AS WELL YES I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I AM PRESENTING AV FIVE SEVENTY ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE SUMMER SANTIAGO- AND HEALTH CARE ACT- AND I'M- ON BEHALF OF THE SUMMER SANTIAGO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S. AMENDMENTS EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY WILL ALLOW ADULT CHILDREN TO ADD THEIR DEPENDENT PARENTS WERE STEPPARENTS TO HEALTH CARE PLANS- THE PARENT OR STEPPAENT MUST BE THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF A QUOTE QUALIFYING RELATIVE. MEANING THAT THEY RELY ON THEIR ADULT CHILDREN FOR MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT. OTHERS NO AGE REQUIREMENT- THE BILLS RECENTLY AMENDED AND NOW ONLY APPLIES TO THE INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE MARKET NOT EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS. THIS BILL WILL SAVE FAMILIES MONEY ON HEALTH CARE COSTS BY ALLOWING THEM TO COMBINE COSTS AND PROVIDES A GREAT OPTION FOR MIXED STATUS FAMILIES AS UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE AN ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE. UNDER COVERED CALIFORNIA- WITH ME TODAY ARE- ARE OUR MAIN WITNESSES MICHAEL MARTINEZ FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ON BY BEHALF OF COMMISSIONER ON A LOT OF- AND THEN- BRUCE BRUCE HINES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS HERE. FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR IF WE COULD PLEASE OPEN IT IS MR MARTINEZ IN THE CHAMBER. I'M ON THE PHONE SURE EDMONTON OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR IF YOU COULD OPEN A PHONE LINE FOR MISTER MARTINEZ R. FIRST PERSON. YES GOOD AFTERNOON SURE ADMIN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL MARTINEZ. SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CARLOTTA THE TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. HE IS VERY PROUD TO BE THE SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SEVENTY AND THEN WE REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FAMILY MEMBER SANTIAGO AND OF COURSE SENATOR WE KNOW FOR PRESENTING- THIS IMPORTANT HEALTH ACCESS MEASURE KNOWN AS THE PARENT. HEALTHCARE ACT. EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN EXPANDING COVERAGE OPTIONS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET TO WORKING FAMILIES. WORKING FAMILIES CAN CURRENTLY BUY SEPARATE POLICIES AND THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET FOR THEIR DEPENDENT PARENTS YET AT A SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE FAMILY BECAUSE EXISTING LAW FORCES THE FAMILY TO PAY SEPARATE OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND MEET SEPARATE DEDUCTIBLES POINT FOR THE WORKING FAMILY AND ANOTHER FOR THE DEFENDANT PARENT. THIS BILL EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY WOULD CHANGE THIS BY ALLOWING THE FAMILY. INCLUDING THE DEPENDENT PARENTS TO BE ON ONE SINGLE POLICY. COMBINING THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS AS WELL AS THEIR DEDUCTIBLE TO SAVE SOME MONEY. FIFTY FIVE SEVENTY FOCUSES ON THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED A MARKET OF LAST RESORT. FOR CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE. ALLOWING ADULT CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS TO THEIR FAMILY POLICY LOWERS THE FAMILY'S COSTS WITHOUT IMPACT TO THE RITUAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS WOULD HAVE BOUGHT AN INDIVIDUAL POLICY ANYWAY. NOW FOR MOST FAMILIES IF THE DEPENDENT PARENT QUALIFIES FOR MEDI CAL OR MEDICARE DOCUMENT PROGRAM WILL BE A BETTER DEAL FOR THE FAMILY. BUT FOR CONSUMERS WITHOUT ACCESS TO THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS FOR THEIR DEPENDENT PARENTS. WILL PROVIDE SOME AN END TO TOY. AS THEY DECIDE THE COVERAGE THAT BEST SUITS THE NEEDS FROM HER FAMILY. WHEN WE NEEDED SHARES CHILDREN OUR PARENTS WERE ALWAYS THERE FOR US. AS OUR PARENTS AGE A LOT OF US IN TURN HAVE BECOME THEIR CARETAKERS AND THIS IS GOING EVEN HARDER TO THE PANDEMIC AND RESULTING ECONOMIC CRISIS. IN CLOSING NOW THAT OUR PARENT TEACHER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CARE FOR THEM AS OUR PARENTS TOOK CARE OF US WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN. PART OF THAT CARE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO ADD THEM TO OUR SAME INDIVIDUAL HEALTH COVERAGE WITH EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY THIS CAN BE A RIP REALITY SO THAT THERE CAN BE. SO THAT WE CAN BE THERE FOR THEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ITEM THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MARTINEZ AND WE HAVE ALSO BRUCE HINES. A YOU SUFFER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARE ARE YOU PREFER OKAY HIS RETURN OKAY SO LET'S GO TO THE LEAD OPPOSITION- WHICH IS JET HAMPTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. A GOOD AFTERNOON CARE UNDER ADMIN AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE SETTING UP YOUR CALL CORNETT ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLAN. I REGRETTABLY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY NOW WE WOULD LIKE. TO THANK THE AUTHOR. MANY SOUTH WORKING WITH US ON THE FILM. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WHILE WE LEAVE THE BILL IS WELL INTENTIONED ANYMORE CAPRICORN THE GOLDMAN FAMILY COVERAGE THE EAGLES CURRENTLY WITHOUT COVERAGE. WE ARE CONCERNED EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY. THE ONLY INCREASE PREMIUMS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFIT YOU PROGRAM EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY ONE COULD PREMIUM. OPERA BETWEEN TWELVE TO FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS I AM ALSO INCREASE CARSHARING PAID BY INDIVIDUALS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. TAKEN TOGETHER WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL MANDATE ALSO MOVED HIS LEGS THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION BUT WE DO HAVE. A CONCERN THAT THE FILMING ONLY FURTHER INCREASE THE COST OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. PARTICULARLY FOR FAMILIES TO BUY COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF THE EXCHANGE. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT TE PROPOSAL YOU FROM. FORTY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED WITH RESPECT TO HOW THIS BILL WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. QUICKLY. IT WILL IMPACT. THE INTERACT WITH OTHER PUBLIC OPTIONS SUCH AS MEDICARE MEDICARE OR OTHER TYPE OF COVERAGE. WE BELIEVE THE DANCERS- THE ANSWER BECAUSE- A CRITICAL TO ENSURING THE CALIFORNIA RIGHT BEFORE ON THE GOAL DO YOU RECALL THE COURT WILL COME. ALL HELP. WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE EIGHTY FIVE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I STEPPED WALKED NOW OF LIFE. AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF ME WATCHING FROM BEHIND THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. I WOULD LIKE ECHO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW ADDITIONAL CONCERNS. WELL WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE TIME AND THE BELL IN THE PLOT THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA IS AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THE BILL MAY HAVE ON THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET ESPECIALLY THE OFF EXCHANGE MARKET YOU KNOW IT'S INCREDIBLY PRICE SENSITIVE. AS MY COLLEAGUE HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO IMPLEMENTATION WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THESE QUESTIONS BE ANSWERED BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD. AS WE WOULD NOT WANT TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE INDIVIDUALS COULD RECEIVE. SUBSIDIZED COVERAGE THROUGH THE EXCHANGE WOULD INADVERTENTLY JEOPARDIZE THEIR COVERAGE LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THEIR CONCERN WITH THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION TIME FRAME OF THE BILL AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS FILED THEIR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO RIGHT FILINGS FOR REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT. AND MAY. IMPACT CREATED BY THIS BILL WOULD CERTAINLY NEED TO BE INCLUDED YET DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE CELL PLANT MANAGERS AND NOT BE ABLE TO CONSIDER THIS AS A PART OF THEIR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO GREAT DEVELOPMENT. FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE BILL IMPLEMENTATION DATE EXTENDED AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN ORDER TO GET HEALTH PLANS INSURERS NECESSARY TIME TO DEVELOP THEIR ACTUARIAL METHODOLOGIES. FOR THESE REASONS REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH BOTH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS. OF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY THANK YOU.

ANYWAY CIVIL THE TROOPER ANALYSIS REGARDING INCREASED PREMIUM EXPENDITURES MOST LIKELY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE MARKET. FOR THIS COVERAGE- AND ALSO MORE PEOPLE PAYING- THE COLUMN ABOUT. CAUTIONARY BECAUSE WE ARE A COUPLE. WITH REGARD TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMENDMENT CARCHIDI NUMBER TAKEN TODAY- PROVIDES THAT ALL CHRISTIANS WHO WOULD BE QUALIFIED FOR MEDICARE WOULD BE INFORMED OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THE STATE'S COUNSELING SERVICE HI CAP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAKE IT CONFORM TO CHOICE REGARDING WHICH- OPTION WOULD BE BEST FOR THEM.

SUPPORTERS HOW HARD HE HAS WORKED TO REALLY- BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE AND TAKE EVERYONE'S CONCERNS- SERIOUSLY AND CLEARLY REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE DATA IN THE BILL ALREADY- I JUST WANNA ADDRESS TWO THINGS AND THAT'S JUST- AGAIN JUST GIVE THE OTHER DEPUTY TO SHARE. HIS THOUGHTS. ARE I THINK THERE WAS A COMMENT ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF INTENTIONALITY ADDED. AND THE PERHAPS THE ABILITY TO INTERPRET THAT DIFFERENTLY. IT MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY IT'S USED. BY OTHERS- IF HE CAN ADDRESS SUCH AS FOR CLARITY THANK YOU. SEVENTEEN THIRTY CENTER PUSHES YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR QUESTION- WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE BEST WAY TO DEFINE. WHETHER A CHEMICALS IN THERE I THINK THE POINT IS. TO IDENTIFY- P. FASTEN THOSE FOREVER CHEMICALS THAT THAT WERE REALLY INTENTIONALLY ADDED RATHER THAN. PERHAPS THERE ARE SOME ACCIDENTAL ADDITION OR- SOME SORT OF. ELEMENT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE- COMPANY AND WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE BEST WAY TO. SORT OF IDENTIFY THAT PARTICULAR- PRODUCT BUT AGAIN. WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS. WITH OPPOSITION ABOUT WHAT HE WHAT THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY. TO IDENTIFY THAT PARTICULAR ELEMENT AS- THANK YOU THAT DOES SOUND TO MY QUESTION ND I YOU KNOW THANK YOU I JUST I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE- AND DOES SECONDLY I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE I MEAN I'M HEARING FROM- THE OPPOSITION THE PROPONENTS. LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT IF I MAY ALSO ADDRESSES WITH THE OTHER GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY AGAIN JUST TO MAKE SURE ON. IT'S CLEAR I MEAN I JUST HEARD A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS- STRONGLY SUPPORTING YOUR BILL WHICH IS GREAT AND I ALSO HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT. THIS BILL OR- SOME OTHER PORTIONS OF THIS BILL MAY BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE STATE'S RECYCLING GOALS AND AGAIN JUST FOR CLARITY CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. THANK YOU. RICHARD I DON'T THINK THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING- AGAIN THE MADE IMPETUS FOR THE- HE FAST ESPECIALLY IN FOOD PACKAGING IS. QUITE OFTEN- TO SAY IN MY JURISDICTION I'M VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE ACTUALLY ALLOW FOOD PACKAGING INTO OUR COMPOST HOWEVER IF THE FOOD PACKAGING HAS P. FASTER SOME OF THESE OTHER- FOREVER CHEMICALS ACTUALLY POLLUTES THE COMPASS SO- AGAIN- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PARTICULAR CONFLICT WITH OUR STATES- RECYCLING LAWS BUT AGAIN THE ELEMENT WAS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THESE CHEMICALS DON'T IN PARTICULAR THE IMPACT THE COMPOSTING BUT ALSO DON'T HARM TO INDIVIDUALS FOR USING IT ON THE OTHER PIECE IS MANY COMPANIES. FOR TWO LARGE FAST FOOD COMPANIES THEY ALREADY PURCHASED- NON P. FAST FOOD PACKAGING IT'S QUITE RANDOM AT THE CLUB IT'S BASED ON LOCATION AND WHICH- WHICH- FOOD PACKAGING- PRODUCERS ACTUALLY PRODUCING IT BUT- WHAT WE WANT TO DO IT BY SENDING SENDING THIS VERY STRONG SIGNAL LEAST IN CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT ALL THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS ARE PURCHASING FOOD PACKAGING THAT NO. LONGER HAS THESE PICTURES CHEMICALS. WELL ONCE AGAIN JUST WANT THANK THE AUTHOR HE'S DONE A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE CONCERNS FOR DRESSING YOU KNOW THESE ARE JUST MINOR QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION.

OPPORTUNITIES THE APPEALS TO APPEARS TO BE NO VALID POLICY REASON TO PROHIBIT TRAINEES FROM BEING COMPENSATED FOR THE WORK THEY DO DURING CLINICAL TRAINING IN THE FIELD. IN FACT PROHIBITING ARNOLD ARE DISCOURAGED THE MORE DIVERSE GROUP OF STUDENTS FROM ENTERING THE HEALTH CARE FIELD BECAUSE- THEY ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITHOUT PAIN MAKING IT. PROHIBITIVE FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO. THIS BILL THIS COMPROMISE. OF SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE INTERNAL REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS LAST YEAR WHICH IS REQUIRED BY MY EIGHTY TWENTY ONE OF FIVE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. AT THE TIME AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO SERVE OUR POPULATION. THIS BILL WOULD HELP BRIDGE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN STUDENTS AND EMPLOYERS CAN ENCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS TO JOIN THE WORK FORCE. COMING IN TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MATT THE SHEIK REPRESENTING AND SHOW YOU AND HELEN ROTH DOWD AND REPRESENTING. THE JEWISH VOCATIONAL SERVICE. THANKS VERY. S. AND THEN THE MEMBER- BUT REGUS AND- THAT'S A MODERATE PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE MATT LUCE FROM S. A. U. CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL AND HELEN DALAM FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO JEWISH VOCATIONAL SERVICES BEGIN WITH METALLURGY. TWO MINUTES GOOD AFTERNOON JERRY MEMBERS MET WITH JAY ON BEHALF OF S. U. CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT OF P. TWELVE SEVENTY THREE. FIRST I LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IN CONTINUING TO CHAMPION EARNING. MORE WE SHALL GET PROFESSIONAL. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT- MY PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL TOOL TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S GROWING WORK FORCE SHORTAGE. BY INSURING REGARDLESS OF INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS- YOU CAN PURSUE THEIR DREAM OF BECOMING A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE EIGHTY TWENTY ONE OF FIVE COMMITTEE WHERE LABOR MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROVIDERS LICENSING BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT. OF RECREATION STANDARDS CAME TOGETHER TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO. TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO EARN AND LEARN PROGRAMMES. AT TWELVE SEVENTY THREE TAKES TWO KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT TO ADDRESSBARRIERS FOR. PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA THE FIRST IS TO ENSURE THAT THE GATEKEEPERS TO HEALTHCARE CAREERS A LICENSING BOARDS. ARE WORKING MORE COLLABORATIVELY COLLABORATIVELY WITH STATE ENTITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE WORKING ON DEVELOPING OUR MARCH STANDARDS. IN THESE PROFESSIONS. THE SECOND IS TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAM ACCREDITATION WHICH IS WHEN A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION CERTIFIED PROGRAM NEEDS THEIR- PRIVACY. ANDERS- THE ARE NOT PREPARED TO- EARNING MORE. HOW LIGHTING BOARD AND HOW DEFERRED PROGRAM THE CREDITORS TO ENSURE THE APPLICANTS HAD GONE TO A REPUTABLE SCHOOL. IN IN ADDITION TO TESTING FOR OTHER LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. EIGHTY TWELVE SEVENTY THREE SIMPLY STATES THAT WHEN A LICENSING BOARD LOOKS TO A PRIVATE ACCREDITING BODY WE MUST ENSURE THAT THOSE BODIES DO NOT PROHIBIT. PROGRAMS TO BE CLEAR THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT IN EIGHTY TWELVE SEVENTY THREE FOUR MANDATE THAT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR EMPLOYER PARTICIPATE IN OUR IN OUR PROGRAM. THIS IS SIMPLY A REVIEW OF EXISTING LICENSING LAWS TO ENSURE THAT THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ALIGNED WITH OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TOOL TWO MINUTES FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR EYES OUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO HELEN DALVIN. FROM SAN FRANCISCO JEWISH VOCATIONAL SERVICES. HI THIS IS REID OUT IN I WAS ALSO AS NETWORK A MAN OF THE ONE OH FIVE TASK FOR. IN CURRENTLY LISTED ON THE ON THE PAYMENT OF THE- TWO THAT DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND CURRENTLY SIT ON THE I. AKA HEALTH SUBCOMMITTEE. AND I WON'T REPEAT A LOT OF SWEAT THAT MATTER ALREADY SAD BUT JUST TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL- TO MEET US OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION. IS AN AB TWELVE THIRTY SIX NOW AT A TRAILER BILL WHICH ADDRESSES THE LACK OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTED BY HEALTH LEGISLATION SIR. BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT PRO IT WILL PROHIBIT A PRIVATE ACCREDITING AGENCIES FOR BANNING THE USE OF EARN AND LEARN. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT SINCE OVER 18% OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE HASN'T HEALTH RELATED LICENSURE. AND HEALTH IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AREAS IN THE ECONOMY. ONE OUT OF FOUR JOBS IS PROTECTED COULD BE RELATED TO HEALTHCARE. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PARTICULARLY STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE COME FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. GENERAL AND ON. THESE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE AS IT IS NOW AT THE THEY CAN'T. BE EMPLOYED AND- IN A PRO AND EDUCATION PROGRAM NOW INSTEAD THEY HAVE TO FOREGO INCOME FOR UP TO TWO YEARS AGO AND TO DEATH. WITH ONE EXCEPTION IS EVERYONE AT REALLY AN EXAMPLE OF THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING WHICH ALLOWS HER TO LEARN MODELS. OF THE INDEPENDENT ROLE AND- WITHOUT REDUCING THE QUALITY OF THEIR TRAINING OR THEIR EDUCATION. THEY CAN GAIN ARE IN LICENSE HERE IN THE ONE PROGRAM I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH. THIS I DON'T IAN'S HE WENT FROM FORTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR NINETY THREE THOUSAND A YEAR AN 85% OF THE LPN WORK FORCES ACTUALLY MINORITIES. SO THIS IS A HUGE WAY OF THEM GETTING INTO VERY MIDDLE CLASS ARE IN JOBS. LET ME GIVE YOU A CONTEST WHICH IS PRIVATE LICENSURE ENTITY FOR RADIOLOGY TECHNICIANS. THEIR LICENSE WHO ARE LICENSED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ACCORDING TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DATA OBTAINING AFTER OBTAINING A LEISURELY ELEGY TECHNICIAN DEGREE OR CERTIFICATION. YOU CAN EARN BETWEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS AFTER FIVE YEARS OLD AND PLEASE READ THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. SO WHEN I JUST IN CLOSING I WANT TO SAY IS I THINK THAT. CALIFORNIA LAW AUTO SUPERSEDE PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS WRAP UP AND NOT BLOCKED THE- PAST TWO AND DISPATCH WITH DANCING THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES SUPPORT OF EIGHTY TWELVE SEVENTY THREE- WILL BEGIN WITH PUBLIC GALLERY SCENE ON THE PUBLIC GALLERY MOVED TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY SCENE ON ROUTE TWENTY FORTY.

GIVE ME TWO MINUTE WARNING KEEP IN MIND YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE HALFWAY POINT. SO BEGIN WITH BLOODY WINTER. HELLO ON BEHALF OF THE JURORS HERE TM SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION OF CALIFORNIA BILL EIGHTY TWELVE SEVENTY THREE SPECIFICALLY. EARN AND LEARN CONCEPTS DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT IT WOULD POSE ON YOUR C. R. T. ACCREDITED PROGRAMS. HERE'S YOUR KEY CURRENTLY CREDIT OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN THE RADIOLOGICAL SCIENCES FORTY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE CALIFORNIA AND WE SERVE AS AN INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RECORD. FOR SIX OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WITHOUT THIS ACCREDITATION THESE PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS DUE TO STUDENTS BEING INELIGIBLE TO TAKE THE NATIONAL CERTIFICATION. CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARDS PROGRAMS CONDUCT AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT INTERNAL EMPLOYMENT AND EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY THE CALIFORNIA CHRISSY PROGRAM SEVEN STREET SOUND EDUCATIONAL QUALITY IS EVIDENT BY THE PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS DATA. THE DATA SUBMITTED BY THESE PROGRAMS FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN ARE REMARKABLE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I CAN PROVIDE THOSE STATISTICS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE CERTIFICATION EXAMINATION PASS RATE IS 86% HIGHER IN THE JOB PLACEMENT RATE VARIES FROM EIGHTY EIGHT TO A HUNDRED PERCENT. THIS DATA HOWEVER IS CRITICAL EVIDENCE THAT DEMONSTRATES THESE PROGRAMS ARE WELL ESTABLISHED AND PROVIDE COMPANY GRADUATE. WORK IN THE WORKPLACE IS ENTRY LEVEL TECHNOLOGY CLOSE IMAGE RESEARCH AND CONTRAINDICATED STATEMENT THAT GRADUATES ARE NOT PREPARED TO CORRECT ENTRY. LEVEL PRACTITIONERS. THE ORACLE DATA FROM BILLS. ELIXIR THE IMPORTANCE FORMALIZED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WE IMPLEMENTED STANDARDS FOR MEDICAL DOSIMETRY TWENTY FOUR TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT REQUESTED MEDICAL BILLS IN THE TREE CERTIFICATION BOARD. PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ON CAPTURING WAS MOST COMMON METHODOLOGY IN THE EDUCATION OF A MEDICAL IMAGERS HOWEVER DUE TO POOR PASTURAGE FOR CREDENTIALING EXAMINATIONS. THE MEDICAL DOSIMETRY CERTIFICATION OR REQUIRE ALL APPLICANTS TO GRADUATE SO BUT HERE'S THE R. T. CRAIG KROGER SINCE THIS REQUIREMENT WAS IMPLEMENTED. THE FIRST. ATTEMPT PASS THREE TO DOUBLE. SHARES THE PULSE PER HIT TO FROM WEARING HIS CLINICAL HOURS. GUARANTEE TO ARE NOT TAKING OFF BY THAT IN. TO PUT IT BACK. ADDITIONALLY SOME STUDENTS ARE NOT REGISTERED- LICENSES RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS. FORMALLY THEY CANNOT PERFORM ANY TASK IN APPROPRIATE SCOPE OF PRACTICE WITHIN THE PROFESSION OF THE RADIOLOGIC SCIENCES. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE NUMEROUS STATE REQUIRED GRADUATION CREATURES HERE KEEP CREDIT PROGRAM TO GAIN EMPLOYMENT PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WOULD HINDER GRADUATES WHO STATED CALIFORNIA SEEKING EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE STATE. IN CLOSING AS IDENTIFIEDIN THE DOCUMENTS BARRIERS IN RECOMMENDATIONS TO FACILITATE LEARNING AND EARNING TRAINING PROGRAMS. IT WAS NOTED THAT. SOME WORKERS WERE TO ENGAGE IN THE DISK WITH YOU CREDITOR. THE J. R. C. E. R. T. HOWEVER DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COMMUNICATION OR GET OUR CREDIT PROGRAMS OR THE- CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FAILED DUE TO LACK OF TRANSPARENCY DRIVEN INSTITUTE. THE BILL RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION IN THE ASSEMBLY THIS BILL FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE AND BENEFITS OF FORMAL TWELVE STRUCTURED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. FINISHERS OF QUALITY HERE AND TAKE THE LIBERTY FINDING RADIATION THE JERSEY ARE KEY IN THE CREDIT HELP CORN PROGRAMS URGE YOU TO CONSIDER EXEMPTING MEDICAL IMAGING RADIATION THERAPY AND MEDICAL DOSIMETRY PROFESSIONALS FROM THIS LEGISLATION.

ALL RIGHT WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CENTER RAS. THANK YOU MR CHAIR YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE- PUBLIC COMMENTS IN THE TESTIMONY I'M- BUT I'M CERTAINLY A SUPPORTER OF EARN AND LEARN PARTICULARLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD AND PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR STATE I AM SOMEWHAT CONCERNED THOUGH AS TO WHETHER WE REALLY HAVE A HANDLE ON THE- SCHOOLS. THE STUDENTS IN THE OCCUPATIONS THAT MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. BY THE CONTENT OF THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF THE FOLKS IN THE RADIOLOGY FEELS NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND THE LIKE. BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF A IF AN ACCREDITING BODY. DOES NOT PERMIT EARN AND LEARN IF THE ACCREDITING BODY PERHAPS IS THE ONLY ACCREDITING BODY IN THE NATION THAT ACCREDITS SCHOOLS AND THERE ARE AT LEAST A FEW OF THOSE IDEAS AS I RECALL PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS FOR EXAMPLE. AT LEAST AT ONE POINT IN TIME HAD ONE ACCREDITING BODY IN THE- IN THE COUNTRY. IN SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS DEPEND ON ACCREDITATION IN ORDER TO GRADUATE AND TO GET JOBS AND CERTAINLY WELL PERHAPS THEY MAY BE WORKING BE ABLE TO WORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SORT OF MOBILITY THAT THEY FULLY EXPECT TO HAVE. WHEN THEY PAY THE MONEY THAT SOME OF THEM PAY TO GO TO SOME OF THESE SCHOOLS AND OBTAIN. THE CREDENTIALS. SO I'M BOTH I JUST SAID I'M GOOD I'M CONCERNED SO I GUESS I HAVE HAVING MADE THAT COMMENT I HAVE A I HAVE A QUESTION. OF THE AUTHOR IF YOU WILL ACCEPT IT AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT ASKING IN ADVANCE. THESE THANK YOU MR SO IF- IF THE PARTICULAR ACCREDITING BODY DOES NOT PERMIT EARN AND LEARN. IF IT'S THE ONLY ACCREDITING BODY THAT ACCREDITS PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IF THE ACCREDITING BODY HAPPENS TO BE OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAWS THAT WE PASS HERE. WHAT'S THE SOLUTION AND WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF ON CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WELL THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT WITH- THE SPONSORS AS WELL OBVIOUSLY THAT THE OPPOSITION THAT CAME IN AS WE SPOKE. FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES- THAT CAME IN LATE JUST RECENTLY SEVEN REALLY BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES AND CONCERNS BUT DEFINITELY WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM I HAVE- REACHED OUT TO ME AS WELL SINCE I JUST SORT OF THEIR OPPOSITION. SO AS SOON AS I GET ARE IN WRITING BACK FROM THEM I LOOK AT DRESSING THEIR ISSUES OBVIOUSLY THIS COULD BE A COMPLICATION WITH SOME OF THESE AGENCIES BUT DEFINITELY I'M I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM TO SEE WHAT YOUR FOLKS IN A BETTER PLACE. I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IS- SOME OF THESE FOLKS BELIEVE THAT- THIS BILLMANDATES PAYMENTS TO STUDENTS WHICH IT DOES NOT IT SIMPLY EASES RESTRICTIONS THAT CURRENTLY. DO NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO EARN MONEY. FOR THE FREE WORK THEY'RE DOING. TWENTY FIVE MISTER JUST ANOTHER. OR TWO. PLEASE THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR LOOKING INTO THIS I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT WE CAN IMPACT. NECESSARILY IF THE ACCREDITING BODY IS LOCATED IN NORTH CAROLINA OR GEORGIA OR CHICAGO WHEN WE- SAY THE ACCREDITING BODIES MAY NOT. RESTRICT EARN AND LEARN I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO US AND THEN IF THAT'S THE BODY THAT ACCREDITS THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE- SCHOOL IF THE ACCREDITING BODY DECIDES NOT TO ACCREDIT THE SCHOOL. AND THE STUDENTS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN IT. DO WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE HAVING. KNOWN MY CURRENT ASSIGNMENT I DABBLE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THE VERS BOARDS AND BUREAUS THAT. FALL UNDER THAT DO WE KNOW HOW MANY OF THE BOARDS AND BUREAUS IN THE- PROGRAMS THAT ARE LICENSED BY THOSE BOARDS AND BUREAUS HOW MANY OF THEM. HAVE EARN AND LEARN- RESTRICTIONS AND HOW MANY. OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ACCREDITED BY. THE BODIES OR ENTITIES OR AGENCIES THAT PROHIBIT EARN AND LEARN. IF I MAY I KNOW- BACK IN- TWENTY SIXTEEN MY A. B. TWENTY ONE OH FIVE WITH SIX POINT THE ISSUE I BELIEVE ABOUT LEISURE FREE STILL ON HE COULD PROBABLY GOING TO BE MORE DETAIL ON THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE YES CAN REBUILD PLEASE BRING BACK MATT LUCE FROM S. YEAH YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON- JANITORS AND CHAIR TWO REGARDING THE TCA THAT PRIMARILY THE RESPIRATORY THERAPY- BOARD RESTRICTS AIRPORT- BUT I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- IN TERMS OF THE RAD TAX WHICH FALLS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WHEN WE WERE IN DISCUSSION WITH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE ACTION DO NOT REQUIRE PROGRAMS TO BE ACCREDITED BY ADAM G. R. CERTAIN CALIFORNIA SO IN TERMS OF- PROGRAM STILL BEING ABLE TO GRADUATE STUDENTS OR NOT THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO GRADUATE AND STUDENTS WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA PRACTICE WITHIN CALIFORNIA. THE REAL ISSUE AND BROUGHT THAT COMES WITH THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT NATIONAL CERTIFICATION WHICH- THAT CUTTING BODY COULD SIMPLY UPDATE THEIR STANDARDS- TO ALLOW EARNING MORE PROGRAMS. AND WOULD COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE BILL. WELL MR I. AM NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THAT DID YOU JUST SAY THAT PROGRAMS. FALL THAT FALL UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. DO NOT NEED TO BE ACCREDITED WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE NURSING PROGRAMS AND ACCREDITATION AND VOCATIONAL NURSING PROGRAMS AND ACCREDITATION. I HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT PROGRAM THAT COULD NOT RETAIN ITS ACCREDITATION BECAUSE THEPROGRAM OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE COULD NOT OFFER A MASTER'S DEGREE. SO I WANNA MAKE SURE. I'M CLEAR I WILL STOP MY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT MISTER CHAIR AFTER I GET A RESPONSE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TO MOVE IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT I HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT. ONE HEALTH CARE TRAINING PROGRAMS AT LEAST UNTIL I GET A HANDLE ON HOW MANY THERE ARE. AND WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE. WITH RESPECTED ACCREDITATION BUT I WOULD LIKE A RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION. SO- DECEMBER ACTUALLY- I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE WHEN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFF LOOKED AT THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK THE VERY QUESTION YOU RAISE IS ONE THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AS WELL- THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS PHRASED AND AGAIN OBVIOUSLY THE SPONSORS OR THE AUTHOR- SAM WRONG PLEASE TELL ME- BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT- IT FOR EXAMPLE IT SAYS THAT THE- DC AIRFARES BOARDS FROM PROHIBITS THEM FROM- PROHIBITING APPROVING ACCREDITING PRO PROGRAM. BUT IT'S THE DATE THE A AND C. P. H. AS WELL THAT THE USUALLY THE BOARD ITSELF IS LICENSING THE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT THE TRAINING PROGRAM SO IN SOME SENSE IS THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF GIVEN THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS PHRASED IN THE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD NOT DIRECTLY- THAT. THE CDPH CERTAINLY AS WE TALK ABOUT THE RADIATION- FOLKS- AS AT THAT DATE WERE TESTIFYING AS WELL AS- DCA. AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY- BE DIRECTLY- BECAUSE THE BLADECENTER'S ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT PROGRAM THAT- THERE ARE SOME LIMITS TO HOW MUCH THE- THAT IMPACTED ACTUALLY HAS ON THE BODY'S ACTUALLY CREDIT. CREDIT THE ACTUAL TRAINING PROGRAM ITSELF WHAT YES MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU ARE YOU MAY BE MORE OF AN EXTRANET AND I KNOW BUT I WILL MISS YOU IF I MAY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL THAT. MIGHT AT LEAST WITH SOME PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE PROGRAM THAT I HAVE TO REPORT TO HER IF YOU'RE NOT A GRADUATE FROM AN ACCREDITED SCHOOL. RIGHT YOUR MOBILITY TO THE EXTENT YOU WERE ABLE TO GET A LICENSE IS SEVERELY LIMITED. AND I THINK WE SHOULD AT LEAST BE AWARE OF THAT AND I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO CHECK ON THAT BEFORE THE BILL COMES UP ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SERRA OFFICER AGNES. YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH IT SO MY COMMENTS WITH SENATOR RAWSON JUSTICE UP ALSO SOMEBODY WHO. HOLDS A LICENSE THAT HAD TO HAVE. GRADUATE OF AN ACCREDITED SCHOOL OF MAKES ME SOMEWHAT NERVOUS ESPECIALLY SINCE SOME OF THE- OPPOSITION AND I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION WAS LATE ENOUGH OR- SOMETHING IS COMMITTED TO. CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS BUT- UP ALL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT. SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING INTO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL WHO ARE OFTEN SOME OF THE ONLY. PEOPLE WILL PROVIDE THIS KIND OF EDUCATION AND SOME OF OUR- AT. NINETY COMMITTEES WROTE. THANK YOU MR TEAR AND I DO APOLOGIZE BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN COMMITTEES I DO HAVE. A BASICALLY THE SAME COME A CONCERN THAT SENATOR ROTH HAS BEEN ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL- I THINK IT STANDS WITH RECRUITMENT IF SOME PROGRAMS ARE. ELIGIBLE TO- PAY FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO GO THROUGH THE CLINICAL PORTION OF THEIR STUDIES. I THINK. A LARGE PORTION OF THE POPULATION AND THE DOES RECRUITMENT TRAINING LIKE A CLLEGE IS IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS- YOU KNOW BIG. BIG SHOW COLLEGE FOR INSTANCE LIKE MANY OF THE COLLEGES THAT CALLED IN AS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. BECAUSE OF BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE% PROGRAM DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PAY PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH THIS RECRUITMENT PART OR THIS. TRAINING PROGRAM FOR THE CLINICAL PORTION. WHEN THEY'RE INTERNING AT THE HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEY DO- MY DAUGHTER IS A NURSE BUT THEY DID TESTING AND TRAINING AT THE SCHOOL AND THEN THEY DID CLINICAL PORTIONS OF THE HOSPITAL IF THEY CAN'T PAY FOR THEM TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. OR THE EMPLOYER OR THE BENEFITING PERSON DOESN'T- ORGANIZATION DOESN'T PAY FOR THEM. THEN THEY COULD GO TO A DIFFERENT PROGRAM AND BECAUSE THEY'RE FREE TO DO THAT AND IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW THEIR CHOICE TO GO TO A PROGRAM THAT PAID THEM TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE TRAINING- TO LEARN. IN SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE WAGE ALLIES I KNOW THE BILL- I GUESS I SHOULD ASK THE AUTHOR. THE BILL DOESN'T MANDATE PAYMENT- FOR CLINICALS RIGHT- INTERNS OKAY THERE'S NO MANDATE FOR PAYMENT AND I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT. IF YOU KNOW HOW STATE CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR THEIR INTERNS TO HAVE CLINICALS N. B. C. PLANT. OR MERCED CAN'T BUT ANOTHER COLLEGE CAN I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE ROAD IS GOING TO BE IN IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT SO- IDEA AND- I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL IN THAT CASE BUT I JUST THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTION IT. IT'S NOT MANDATED BUT I THINK IT LIES IN THE RECRUITING PIECE- FOR CLASSES TO CONTINUE AND IT AFFECTS. THE COLLEGE IS DIFFERENT IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD AND TO PAY FOR THE CLINICALS- IN THE INTERNSHIP PROCESS THANK YOU SIR FOR LETTING ME ASK QUESTIONS OF COURSE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- RUBIO. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND- I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT CLEARLY THIS ROBUST IMPORTANT DEBATE HAS CREATED SOME-QUESTIONS THAT- AND I UNDERSTAND THOUGH THE LATE OPPOSITION SOMETIMES REALLY DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS- WHEN IT COMES TO SLATE AND ALSO AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IT'S DIFFICULT TO. TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES AND AGAIN I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE OPTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AND REALLY GO DEEP AND ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE LEFT UNANSWERED AND I WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE QUESTIONS AND ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED BEFORE FOURTEEN KIA. THANK YOU A CERTAIN AMOUNT THANK YOU ANYTHING HERE YOU'RE SEEING A PATTERN HERE OF A KIND OF COMING IN FEELING REALLY CONFIDENT AND THEN SWING WE WAIT WAIT. WHAT'S HAPPENING- IN AS SOMEONE WHO DID HAVE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CALL AND- MY QUESTION IS. YOU CAN YOU JUST PLEASE CLARIFY IT WHERE THE FUNDING IS SUPPOSED TO COME FROM- IS IT THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IS THERE GOING TO BE- A PRIVATE PUBLIC OPPORTUNITY IS ALL OF THE ABOVE NOTHING SPECIFIED- AND I GUESS. I AM THINKING ALONG THE LINES THAT. IF THEIR FUNDING ISN'T THERE HOW DOES THAT IMPACT THE PROGRAM THE EXPERIENCE AND THE TRAINING- IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PAIN BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE- WHAT'S THE FALLOUT OF NOT HAVING SOME OF THIS- AND CERTAINLY THE ACCREDITATION PIECES HAS BEEN MENTIONED- IS ALSO. SOMETHING THAT'S ON MY MIND. IT DEFINITELY GET IT OVER WITH THE LATE OPPOSITION TO A LOT OF QUESTIONS CAME SO I REALLY CAN'T ANSWER A LOT OF THEM. HAVE DEFINITELY LOOK INTO IT AND- MAYBE DIFFERENT AMOUNT AGAIN WOULD YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO KIND OF HELP WITH SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION AND CONCERN FOR HAVING THAT. YOU HAVE TO GET BETTER OKAY THE CHAIR. YES PLEASE DO. YEP AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BETTER. I WOULD I WOULD JUST RESPOND BY SAYING THAT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR PAYMENT OR FUNDING TO HAPPEN IN THIS CASE THIS IS JUST REALLY ENSURING THAT IT THE PROGRAM. AND WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A- PROGRAM THAT YOU CAN DO SO I'M IN ASKING OUR STATE LICENSING STANDARDS TO ALIGN WITH THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT. I'M WAITING- IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT A BIG TO THE CREATION OF RUNNING PROGRAMS. NO REQUIREMENT ON FUNDING- DID NOT REQUIRING SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE. WAGES OR ANYONE TO PROVIDE REACHES FOR PAYMENT. SO I GUESS IF I IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT I GUESS I'M THINKING WELL WHAT WAS THE IDEA LIKE WHERE IS THIS GOING TO COME FROM IS IT POTENTIALLY FROM THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND SO. YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY I THINK THAT- THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF COMMENTS THAT ARE BROUGHT UP AND I ALSO ENCOURAGE. THE OPPOSITION TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND SOME OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BUT I'M NOT SURE WE'VE GOTTEN SOME OF THE ANSWERS ON EITHER SIDE- TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WILL REALLY LOOK LIKE ONCE IT'S BEING- IMPLEMENTED BY THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO BUT IT BUT IT'S BEEN A ROBUST AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SAYING NINE ACTUALLY I DO HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY- SOMEBODY ELSE ACTUALLY POSE THIS TO- TO- MATT LUCE BUT THIS YEAR I USE SO WE DO HAVE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WE HAVE OPPONENTS- WHO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THIS JOINT REVIEW COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION RADIATION RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGY J. OR SEARCH OUT THERE SHE TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION THEY DO HAVE AN ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENT. ACTUALLY FOR BIDS- STUDENTS RUNNING WAGES FOR CLINICAL HOURS OR- SO WOULDN'T BILL DOES IS LIKE I WANNA KNOW WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE SO WITH THIS BILL BASED ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS OF THE SPELLS A SPONSOR. FOR BID- PROGRAMS- DEREK CREDITED BASICALLY J. J. R. SIR ACCREDITED PROGRAMS FROM OPERATING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THAT I WOULD JUST RESPOND BY THIS IS ACTUALLY A REAL REQUIREMENT ON OUR LICENSING BOARDS WERE THE GATEKEEPERS FOR THESE PROGRAMS FOR THEM TO UPDATE THE STANDARDS AND USE ACCREDITING BODIES BACK ALLOW EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS. OKAY BUT IT DIDN'T QUITE ANSWER MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS THAT OKAY THE- THE BODY I THINK IT'S C. PH ACTUALLY ACCEPTS- WITH THIS IS INTENTION IS BILLED TO SAY BECAUSE THIS MAY BE I THINK IT MAY BE I'M NOT SURE FOR SURE AND MAYBE THE ONLY CREDITING BODY FOR- FOR. THESE RADIOLOGY THAT THESE TECHNICIANS RADIOLOGICAL TECHNICIANS WOULD FOR BID. C. P. H. FROM RECOGNIZING GRADUATES. OF PROGRAMS ARE ACCREDITED BY JERRY BY JAY ARE SERVED. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IT IT WOULD. BE J. R. SERV MAINTAIN. THEIR PROHIBITION AGAINST OUR OWN LEARN IF WOULD ASK THEM TO- IT WOULD NOT THEY WOULD NOT USE THAT CREDIT CARD. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CITY CALIFORNIA FOR RAT PACKS RECOGNIZES PROGRAMS- IN RECOGNIZES GRADUATES THAT- ARE ABLE TO GRADUATE COMPONENT EVEN IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THE G. R. CERTIFICATION SO WHEN TALKING TO. THAT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE THEY DO NOT HAVE A ON THE BILL BECAUSE HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT GRADUATE RIGHT TAX- THEY WOULD STILL RECOGNIZE AND BE ABLE TO GET THEIR LICENSE. THE WHOLE WITHIN OUR INTENTION IS THAT WE WOULD REMOVE BARRIERS EARNING MONEY PROGRAMS AND- IN. ORGANIZATIONS UPDATE THEIR STANDARDS RECOGNIZED THIS NEW MODEL. OKAY ALL RIGHT. NOW I'VE MET THAT WHEN I WAS TALKING TO THE STAFF THE NOW AT LEAST WE WERE DISCUSSING IT. AT THE LEAST THE LANGUAGE DIDN'T APPEAR THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN WITH THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED- BUT IT IS HELPFUL FOR ME TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE. IN RELATION TO DEVELOP I THINK YOU HEAR THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT WHAT WOULD RESULT I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE GOAL. OF TRYING TO NOT DISCOURAGE EARN AND LEARN- BUT- AND- BUT I THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT THE CONCERNS ARE BEING RAISED THAT- THERE'S ISSUES RELATED TO- YEAH. ACTUALLY THE PIPELINES AND STANDARDS FOR US. FOR VARIOUS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS I DO KNOW THAT SIR LEYVA HAS HER MICROPHONE UP SO- I WILL. MOVE IT TO HER BUT I DO HAVE SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS WELL SO THEIR LABOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WON THE ECHO LL THE COMMENTS MADE FROM YOURSELF AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'LL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL TODAY BUT I TOO WILL BE HOPING SOMEBODY TO ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED. AND IF IT GETS TO THE FLOOR THEY WILL BE ADDRESSED AND I CAN STILL SUPPORT THE BILL OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA- THE AND- THE OTHER QUESTION I DO HAVE- IN A BIG DOSE OF THE COMMITTEE SAYS OUR LAST BILL TO- FOR. SO I USE THIS ACTUALLY SAT ON THE BOARD AND ACCREDITATION BODY SO I SAT ON IT HEALTH CARE ACCREDITATION NO HEALTH EDUCATOR- PREDATION BODY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS FOR AN ACCREDITATION BODY FOR THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES THAT WE DON'T. GAUGE IN ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR- THAT THE STAN. ARE PURELY- EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I POSE TO J. CERT- SO WE HAVE THE CLG SORT OF TESTIFIED. YOU KNOW I HEARD THAT YOU SAID THE RATIONALE FOR BIDDING- STUDENTS BRAVING RAGES IN CLINICAL HOURS TWO INCH TO WAS TO QUOTE INSURE THEY'RE NOT USED TO REPLACE QUALIFIED STAFF. WHICH SOUNDS ANTI COMPETITIVE CAN YOU JUSTIFY WHY THAT REQUIREMENTS IN EXISTENCE I REALIZE THAT THAT'S A BIT SEPARATE FROM THE BILL. BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. WHAT WAS THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS WHY THAT REQUIREMENT IS AN EDUCATIONAL STANDARD AND IT'S NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE. THE STANDARD DATA YOU ARE PROVIDING IDEAS FROM EARNING WAGES FOR CLINICAL HOURS AND ASSIGNMENTS THAT PROHIBITION DOES NOT HOW DOES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE QUALITY PROGRAMS ARE ENSURING THAT- THE STUDENTS ARE MEETING STANDARD EXACT. REPEAT PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS NOT. HELLO HELLO YES SO I GUESS THAT'S- MISS- LET'S SEE WINTER PLEASE. HI SO THE STUDENTS ARE STUDENTS AND THEY'RE NOT CLINICALLY COMPETENT. ON MANY CORCORAN SUPERVISED YOU SURE THEY'RE NOT TAKING A DIG. HIGHS IN POSITIONS THAT COULD COMPROMISE THEN YOU. OKAY THEY CAN BE STUDENTS AND RECEIVE HEY BUT- I DON'T SEE HOW THAT HAS TO DO WITH NO THEY CANNOT I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT. WELL THEY THEY ONLY BECAUSE OF THE STANDARD YOU PUT IN PLACE NOT BECAUSE- THE ANOTHER IT'S A SUPERVISION STANDARD IS ABOUT EDUCATIONAL QUALITY. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE PAYING US TO DO WITH THAT. EDUCATIONAL QUALITY INSURERS THAT WE'RE DELIVERING IONIZING RADIATION THANKS FOR SHARING. QUALITY PATIENT CARE. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER- THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO ASK FOR THE QUESTION THAT- OKAY- ALL RIGHT WELL WITH THAT- I THINK THAT- SEMI RODRIGUEZ I THINK YOU HEAR THERE ARE SOME OPEN QUESTIONS- THAT- NEED TO BE WORKED ON- I THINK ARE YOU KNOW- WE CAN TRY TO WORK ON SOME OF THEM IS- IN THIS COMMITTEE- BUT I THINK THAT SOME OTHER ONES ARE ALSO OPEN. SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN TRY TO WORK THAT OUT- WITH THE KNOWLEDGE IS THE OPPOSITION BUT ALSO TO ENSURING THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING A ALTERNATE PROBLEM I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE PARTICULARLY FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS WHO- ALSO THAT WHO WHO MAY ALSO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO GO ESSENTIALLY WITHOUT PAY- OR HAVE TO COMPLETE MORE LOANS- IF ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE WHILE THERE IS WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING- AND- PROVIDING- YELP CLINICAL SERVICES UNDER SUPERVISION UNDER AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM SO I THINK THAT'S A WORTHY GOAL- BUT I ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME CONCERTS SERMONS ABOUT THE WAY THE BILLS FRAME TO CLARIFY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ESSENTIALLY DENYING PEOPLE ALSO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF CONFLICTS WITH ACCREDITATION- AS. WELL SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YOU THANK YOU WILL- YOUR VOICES MESSAGES BEEN. I WORK OTHER SPONSORED A LOT OF THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS ARE BROUGHT TODAY.
