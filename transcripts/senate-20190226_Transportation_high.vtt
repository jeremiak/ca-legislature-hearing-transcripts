00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:41.613
QUARTERS.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.915
WHEREAS LAST YEAR WAS A HUNDRED

00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:46.084
AND FIFTY ONE TO INCREASES ONE

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:46.618
IS.

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:49.121
A AN INCREASE IN IN THE THE

00:19:49.187 --> 00:19:50.889
NUMBER OF BEDS THAT ARE COMING

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:52.257
AND SO THE ADS CALTRANS IS

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:53.625
RAMPING UP THE NUMBER PROJECTS

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.460
THAT ARE GOING OUT --

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.229
WE'RE DOING MORE REVIEWS TO TO

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.363
GET THOSE PROJECTS GOING SO I

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.865
THINK IT REFLECTS THE INCREASED

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:01.366
WORKLOAD AS A RESULT OF SB.

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:02.834
ONE AND THEN ALSO INCREASES THE

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.469
REFLECTS AN INCREASE THAT AS A

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:06.905
RESULT OF A BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:07.873
WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR THAT

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.441
ALLOWED US TO EXPAND SOME

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:11.009
LOOKING INTO THE BITS AGO INTO

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:12.411
LOCAL AGENCIES SO WHAT WE'RE

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:14.880
DOING BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:17.449
AGENCY CONTRACTOR HE'S.

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:18.584
MOVING THE PAGE --

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.285
FIVE AND SIX JUST HERE I THOUGHT

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:21.753
I WOULD HIGHLIGHT TO AUDITS THAT

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.822
WERE RELEASED IN --

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:24.556
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT ARE

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:27.793
SPECIFIC TO SB ONE SO ONE IS --

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:29.227
THE WHAT WE CALL THE BASELINE

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:31.530
FOR SB ONE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES --

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:33.799
THIS IS AN AUDIT THAT THE STAFF

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.233
DID -- TO

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.535
REALLY INSURE THAT THERE WAS AN

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.704
ACCURATE BASELINE FOR MEASURING

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.404
SOME OF THESE THINGS GOING

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.706
FORWARD SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.641
MEASURING THE NUMBER BRIDGES

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:43.809
FIXED OR THE NUMBER OF OF

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.377
COLBERT'S REPAIRED AND

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:46.178

ESTABLISH AN APPROPRIATE

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:49.881
BASELINE SO THAT IN FIVE YEARS

00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:51.850
IF YOU'RE MEASURING THE OUTCOMES

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.018
CAN WE BE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.720
COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES AND

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:58.423
WE REALLY DID GET --

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.725
THOSE DOLLARS --

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:00.993
ONE CATEGORY THAT WAS NOT

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.527
COMPLETED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.463
IS UNDER WAY NOW IS A REVIEW OF

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:07.032
THE BASS LINE ON PAVEMENT AND SO --

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.934
ESTABLISHING THE APPROPRIATE

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.035
MEASUREMENT OF THE PAVEMENT

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.437
CONDITION TO COMPARE THAT TO THE

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:15.374
OUTCOMES OVER TIME.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.142
PAGE SIX TALKS ABOUT AN AUDIT WE

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.377
DID ON THE EFFICIENCY MEASURES

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:19.978
SO AS YOU ALL KNOW SB ONE

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:21.079

ONE PALACE COULD COMMENT ON THAT.

00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:19.650
I THINK THE TRANSPORTATION

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:20.985
COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.020

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.822
THE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.891
THAT CORRECT HONOR WE WE SERVICE

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:28.459
THE TARGET UNDER MILLION.

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.795

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:41.839
THAT IS THERE ARE OTHER THINGS

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:43.374
WE NEED TO DO --

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:43.974
WHAT?

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.142
CSO THE END AS YOU NOTED THAT

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.577
THE CALTRANS IS REQUIRED TO

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:47.812
SUBMIT IT TO THE COMMISSION THE

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.046
COMMISSION DOESN'T HAVE AN

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.682

FEEDBACK --

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:58.589
THERE WERE --

00:40:58.656 --> 00:40:59.490
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.258
CALTRANS IS DOING THERE THERE

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.259
ARE QUITE A FEW OTHER THINGS

00:41:02.326 --> 00:41:04.128
WHICH CALTRANS IS DOING IN AS A

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.696
JUST STARTED TO QUANTIFY THEY'VE

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:07.198

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:09.166
WHICH THEY HAVEN'T QUANTIFIED AS

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:10.568
WELL BUT HAVE STAND STILL BE

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:11.168
ABLE.

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:12.670
TO ARTICULATE AS EFFICIENCIES

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.605
AND WE HAVE ENCOURAGE THEM TO

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:17.107
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE --

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:19.009
INCLUDING SOME OF THE EFFORTS

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.377
WHICH MAY NOT HAVE IS --

00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:21.812
AS BIG OF A DOLLAR AMOUNT WITH

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:23.848
THEM BUT ARE IMPORTANT JUST IN

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:24.949
NEW YORK IF THERE IF YOU'RE ABLE

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:26.450
TO CUT DOWN THE PA THE

00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:27.985
PROCESSING OF SOME ME A PAPER

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:30.321
THAT THAT GETS SUBMITTED BY.

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:30.888
FROM FORTY FIVE DAYS TO TWO

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:33.691
WEEKS IT MAY NOT OUT A LOT BUT

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:34.625
IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT FISH AND

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:35.826
SEE -- THEIR

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.027
NUMBER OF A A THEIR THINGS THAT

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:38.028
I I THINK --

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:39.864
WE COULD DO JUST AS A STATE ONE

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:40.397
OF THE COMMISSION'S

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:41.632
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.033
LEGISLATURE --

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.901
IS --

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:46.770
FOCUSED ON AND RESEARCH AT THAT

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:48.239
SPARK SOME OF WHICH IS FUNDED BY

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:49.940
SB ONE AND SOME WHICH HAS OTHER

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:53.244
FUNDING AND THE IDEA OF CREATING

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.345
SOME KIND OF CLEARING HOUSE I

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:57.214
THINK THE COMMISSION WE WE COULD

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:58.115
PLAY A ROLE IN THAT.

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.717
BUT WHERE THAT WHERE THAT TYPE

00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:01.218
OF INFORMATION COULD BE SHARED

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:02.987
ON RESEARCH THAT'S DONE BY

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:04.488
UNIVERSITIES RESEARCH HAS COME

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:05.589
BY CALTRANS.

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:07.858
ED AND SHARED WITH THE PEOPLE AT

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:19.003
RESEARCH COME OUT THERE THEY'RE

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.970
BEGINNING TO FINISH.

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:22.006
SOME OF THOSE RESEARCH PROJECTS

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:23.941
THAT WE'RE INITIALLY FOUND WITH.

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.277

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.082
WITHIN WITHIN OUR TRANSIT IN

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:32.983
ZERO CAPITAL PROGRAM MANY OF THE

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.884
TYPES OF CAPITAL PROJECTS

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:35.085
AGENCIES ARE PURSUING HELP MAKE

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:36.954
THEIR SYSTEMS MORE EFFICIENT ON

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:38.489
SOME OF THOSE --

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:39.590
OPERATIONS SAVINGS ARE THEN

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.392
REINVESTED IN BETTER ERVICES

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:42.760
THE FURTHER GROW THE RIDERSHIP

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:43.360
AND REVENUES OF THE SYSTEM AND

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:44.862
SO THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE AREAS

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:45.963
THAT WE GIVE CREDIT TO AS

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.065
AGENCIES ARE ARE TRYING TO LOOK

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:49.233
FOR WAYS TO MAKE THEIR SYSTEMS

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.267
MORE EFFICIENT.

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:52.269
WE ALSO ENCOURAGE MUCH OF THE

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:54.838
INTEGRATION BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:56.273
CAP PLANNING TOGETHER ON HOW TO

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.207
MAKE --

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:59.376
TRANSIT AND RAIL COORDINATE WELL

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:00.744
IN REGIONS IN THAT THAT ALSO

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:04.014
COMES INTO THE AREA OF IMPROVING

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:04.615
THE EFFICIENCY OF THE OVERALL

00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:05.015
SYSTEM.

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:08.419
SORRY --

ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO COMMENT ONE

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:12.356
OF THE THINGS THAT AS I

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.124
MENTIONED REMARKS AS WE HAVE

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:14.858
STATE LAW.

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.794
CONTINUES OUR SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.628
TO THE END OF THE YEAR AT THE

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:18.729
END OF THE YEAR WE LOSE THAT AND

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:20.397
THENTHE ASSIGNMENT GOES AWAY

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.099
WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF ADDITIONAL

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.801
LAW.

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:27.171
OKAY THAT'S RELATED TO NEPA.

00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:28.839

THAT ONCE BEFORE WE EXTENDED OUT.

00:43:33.644 --> 00:43:34.712
SO I THINK THAT'S OF NO FOUR ON

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:38.115
THE LIST.

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:38.749

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.517
LOT OF THE SAVINGS THAT ARE

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:41.418
IDENTIFIED A REALLY RELATED TO

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:42.419
TIME.

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.555
AND AND NOT HAVING DELAYS AND SO

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:45.556
WHAT WE'VE --

00:43:45.622 --> 00:43:46.957
KIND OF PUSHED ON IN OUR

00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:48.692
DISCUSSIONS ON THE EFFICIENCIES

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:49.827
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SO FAR

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:52.963
IS WHERE OF FEES THAT SAID IN A

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.931
FIGHT AS AN EFFICIENT.

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.099
A MEASURE FOR THE TIME IS

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.567
SHORTENED THERE IS TO REALLY

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:57.968
LOOK AT THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:59.636
PROJECT AND IF YOU'RE LOSING

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:01.071
TIME SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:02.339
MAYBE ARE NOT ACHIEVING THE

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.907
GREATEST EFFICIENCY OVER ALL SO

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.209
I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:06.977
TO PUSH A LITTLE HARDER ON A

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.712
LOOKING AT THE END ENTIRE LENGTH

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:11.448
OF SOMETHING --

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:12.082
NOT JUST MAKING PARTICULAR PHASE

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:16.420
A SHORTER HE EXPEDITED.

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.255
I I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION --

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:21.325
MAYBE --

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:23.427
CHAD AND JIM PROBABLY WOULDN'T

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:25.462
KNOW THIS --

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:27.631
ONE ONE OF THE RESEARCH PROJECTS

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:30.067
IS BEING DONE BY UC AND SEE A

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:33.003
SHOE IS THE SERVER PAYMENT

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.238
MATERIALS ISSUE.

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:37.107
AND THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH ON

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:40.144
LONGER LASTING PAVEMENT IF YOU

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.912
WANT TO SET THAT WAY --

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:43.147
I KNOW CALTRANS HAS ITS OWN

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.348
RESEARCH --

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.483
THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THAT --

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.787
IF WE GET PAYMENT TO LAST LONGER.

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:52.790
OF THE WEAR AND TEAR OR IS

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:54.758
BETTER AND IT IS SOME

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:58.495
IMPROVEMENTS SURROUND ON THAT IS --

00:44:58.562 --> 00:44:59.830
AN EFFICIENCY.

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:01.532
OF CAN YOU GIVE US SOME

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:03.667
INFORMATION ON THAT ISSUE.

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:06.103
WHAT'S CALTRANS UP TO ON A SURE

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.372
CENTER WITH THE WHO HAS TO LAST

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.174
LONGER WE PUT IT DOWN THIS WAY

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.775
PUT IT SOMETIMES. ONE OF THINGS

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:14.044
I THINK WITH A DELEGATION OF THE

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.312
WORK TO THE DISTRICTS AND

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:17.281
DEFINING THAT WORK.

00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:19.183
THEY'RE STARTING TO LOOK AT

00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:20.417
THREE QUARTERS AND LOOK AT WHERE

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:22.653
IS THE BEST PLACE TO PUT A LONG

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:23.787
LASTING PAVEMENT.

00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:24.922
LONG LASTING PAYMENT IS MUCH

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:26.256
MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO WE HAVE TO

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:27.591
LOOK FROM A LIFE CYCLE COST

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:29.927
PERSPECTIVE MASS TO BE EVALUATED

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:32.129
ON INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS BUT WE

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:32.763

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.631
IN THE PROPUESTAS FOR THAT AND

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:35.332

THEY NEED TO BE A LONGER TERM

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:48.899
STRATEGY ABOUT.

00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:51.468
HOW WE'RE GOING TO ATTRACT AND

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:53.436
RETAIN THE BUDGET --

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:55.438
BECAUSE IT IT IS OF GREAT

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.040
CONCERN ESPECIALLY ON FOR

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:59.442

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.281
WE ARE BEYOND.

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:05.582
THE SCOPE WHEN IT COMES TO BEING

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:20.263
ONE AND THAT WAS THE TRANSIT

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.199
FUNDING PROVIDED WITHIN SB --

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:24.534
ONE CITY IS THE FIFTH LARGEST

BUS OPERATOR IN THE STATE A LOT

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:27.403
OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT WE

CARRIED FORTY EIGHT MILLION

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:30.139
PEOPLE LAST YEAR.

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:31.574
WE HAVE A LARGE BUS FLEET OF

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:32.508
FIVE HUNDRED BUSES IN A PARA

00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:33.810
TRANSIT FLEET OF TWO HUNDRED AND

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:35.144
FORTY EIGHT BUSES.

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:37.013
PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:37.981
WE HAD WENT IN FRONT OF OUR

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:38.848
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND TALKED

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:41.417

EIGHTY THOUSAND SERVICE HOURS.

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:46.356
THAT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED --

00:58:46.422 --> 00:58:48.424
REDUCING PARA TRANSIT SERVICE

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:50.126
FIXED ROUTE OPERATIONS SERVICE

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:51.794
AND LAYOFFS OF KEY EMPLOYEES --

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.162
IN IN OUR SERVICE AREA AS WE

00:58:53.229 --> 00:58:56.165
FRANKLY TO IT'S GOING.

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:58.268
SB ONE REALLY SAVED THE DAY THAT

00:58:58.334 --> 00:58:59.836
ALLOWED US NOT ONLY.

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.638
TO KEEP AT THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.439
IN PLACE BUT IT ALLOWED US TO

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:04.741
COMPLETELY REDO HOW WE THOUGHT

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:05.909
ABOUT TRANSIT SERVICE IN THE

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:07.443
COUNTY AND THAT WAS A MEDIA THAT

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.245
DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:11.047
AN APPROVAL PROCESS AT A LATER

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:11.614
DATE IT WAS IN THE EXISTING

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.750
PROGRAM IT ALLOWED US TO KEEP

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:15.885
THE SERVICE GO IN IT ALLOWED US

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.487
TO REPLACE AGING BOSSES AND MAKE

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.588
INVESTMENTS --

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:21.291
INTO OUR TRANSIT OPERATIONS --

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:21.624
BASIS -- AS

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:22.692
WELL.

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:24.027
IT ALLOWED US TO BUY ZERO

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:25.662
EMISSION BUS PURCHASES TO EXPAND

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.363
SERVICE ON MAIN STREET BETWEEN

ANAHEIM IN COSTA MESA WHICH IS A

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.066
KEY PART.

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:32.268
OF OUR COUNTY --

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.270
ININ ORANGE COUNTY.

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:35.939
THE TRANSIT FUNDING --

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:36.940
ONE ONE OF THE REASONS IT

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.541
PROVIDED SUCH IMMEDIATE BENEFIT

00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:40.009
IS THROUGH THE FOUR SITES OF THE

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.744
PROGRAM IT WAS FORMULA BASED

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:42.745
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT.

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:44.080
BUT IT ALSO IS PROVIDED THROUGH

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:44.948
AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT

00:59:45.014 --> 00:59:46.182
PROGRAMS THE STATE TRANSIT

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.383
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.585
IN IS ALLOWED FOR US TO GO VERY

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:51.120
CLEARLY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:52.622
THE FUNDING FOR FLEXIBILITY THE

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.057
REQUIREMENTS THE RESTRICTIONS IN

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:54.891
THE METRICS.

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.592
SO WE COULD PUT THE DOLLARS TO

00:59:56.659 --> 00:59:57.427
WORK RIGHT AWAY.

00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:59.262
CONCURRENT TO THAT IT ALSO

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:00.463
ALLOWED US TO MAKE PROGRESS ON

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.432
OUR CORE TRANSIT SERVICE AREA IS

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:03.633
PART OF OUR OVERALL A

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.368
COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS PLAN ON

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.569
THIS BUS.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:07.737
THREE SIXTY WE REALLOCATED

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.205
SERVICE WITHIN THE WITHIN THIS

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.807
WITHIN THE COURSE SERVICE AREA

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.041
SO INSTEAD OF CUTTING SERVICE

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.543
WERE ABLE TO ADD SERVICE AS A

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:14.844
RESULT OF SB.

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:15.812
ONE LOOKING FORWARD --

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:16.579
THE FUTURE SB ONE FUNDS WE

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:19.582
BELIEVE WILL FOR FLEXIBILITY IN

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:22.719
BOTH FOR CAPITAL AND OPERATING

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.187
EXPENSES AND THAT'S VERY

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:25.521
IMPORTANT AS A TRANSIT OPERATOR.

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:26.522
THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO EXPAND

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:28.391
POTENTIALLY EXPAND OUR TRANSIT

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.993
SERVICE IN HIGH DEMAND QUARTERS.

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:31.761
OF CORNERS AND SERVE NOT ONLY

OUR LONG COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.298
FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN OUR

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.200
REGIONAL PLANS IN SUPPORT.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:38.768
REDUCTIONS.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.069
IN CONCLUSION I COULD SPEND A

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:41.537
BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT ALL

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:42.505

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:20.937
PROTECTIONS --

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:21.971
TO ENSURE THE FUNDS CAN ONLY BE

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:23.606
USED FOR TRANSPORTATION AND NOT

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:25.174
FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE --

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.075
THESE ARE THE THREE CORE

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:27.643
ELEMENTS OF THE OVERALL PACKAGE

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:28.845
AND AS SOON AS SB ONE WENT INTO

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.613

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.247
CITIES ACROSS THE STATE STEPPED

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.616
UP TO THE CHALLENGE THEIR LIST

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:34.750
OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:36.152
FINDING WITH THE NEW REVENUE --

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:37.653
AND REPORTED WHERE EVERY SB ONE

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.722
DOLLAR WAS SPENT JUST THIS PAST

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:40.356
OCTOBER TO CLOSE OUT THE FISCAL

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.892
YEAR.

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:43.893
WHAT'S THE ONE WHICH CHAPTER IN

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.894
APRIL COLLECTION YOU REVENUE

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.362

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:47.997
NOVEMBER --

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:48.564
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH CITY

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.599
SEEING THEIR FIRST PAYMENT IN

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.400
EARLY --

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:51.934
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEREFORE

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:53.469
THERE'S JUST BEEN A BIT OVER A

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:55.071
YEAR OF THESE FUNDS --

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:56.572
QUITE LITERALLY HEADING CITY

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:57.273
STREETS --

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.708
BUT WORK IS BEING FORMED ACROSS

01:02:58.774 --> 01:02:59.775
THE STATE --

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:02.912
WITH HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:05.081
FORECASTED YEARS AHEAD.

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.949
AS FOR THE IMPACT OF SB ONE THE

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:07.917
LEAGUE KNOWS --

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:09.018
THROUGH OUR LOCAL SHE THROUGHOUT

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:09.519
THE NEEDS SSESSMENT --

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:10.520
WHICH IS BEEN CONDUCTED EVERY

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:11.854
OTHER YEAR --

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:14.123
FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS THAT THE

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.958
IMPACT OF SB ONE IS IMMENSE.

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.693
UP INTO OUR MOST RECENT REPORT

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.628
THE AT FUNDING NEEDS FOR LOCAL

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:19.562

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.130
CONSISTENTLY EXCEEDED OVER

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.632
SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:23.166
WOULD HAVE GROWN BY TWENTY

01:03:23.232 --> 01:03:24.333
BILLION.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.034
IN TEN YEARS ABSENT ANY NEW

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:27.003

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:29.472
ON A SCALE OF ZERO TO ONE

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:30.606
HUNDRED THE AVERAGE PAY MY

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.542
CONDITION WAS AT SIXTY FIVE

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:35.378
PROJECTED TO SLIDE DOWN TO FIFTY

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:35.945
FIVE TEN YEARS.

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.647
SCORE FIFTY FIVE IN THE

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.048
CLASSROOM IS AN F. --

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.683
WE ALSO KNEW THAT WITHOUT ANY

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:43.653
NEW FUNDING. 49% OF THE LOCAL

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.421
NETWORK WOULD HAVE MOVED INTO AN

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.223
ACT RISK CONDITION THAT MEANS

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.925
THE SCORE BELOW.

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.425
SEVENTY ON THE PAVEMENT

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.526

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:51.794
WITH MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THE

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:52.662
NETWORK MOVING INTO THE FIELD

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:55.031
CONDITION --

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.532
WHICH WHICH WE WOULD CATEGORY

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:57.967
CRIES AS AS RED --

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:59.202
WHEN YOU LOOK AT LOOK AT IT ON A

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:01.237
MAP?

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.105
WITH SB ONE THAT'S NO LONGER THE

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.974
CASE -- THE

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:05.875
I MET FUNDING THE FOR LOCAL SHE

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:07.843
THROWS HAS SHRUNK BY ABOUT

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:08.444
EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.246
THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:10.947
AND THE AVERAGE PAVEMENT

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:12.148
CONDITION WILL STABILIZE RIGHT

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.150
AROUND SCORE OF SIXTY FIVE FOR

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:16.452
THE NEXT TEN YEARS --

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:17.920
MOST IMPORTANTLY --

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:19.522
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE LOCAL

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:21.090
NETWORK WILL MOVE INTO A STATE

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.959
OF GOOD REPAIR --

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.594
OR SCORE BUT SEVENTIES AS CITIES

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.028
AND COUNTIES FOCUS ON A FIX IT%

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:27.597
FOR STRATEGY --

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.232
TO MAXIMIZE EVERY PENNY OUT OF

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:30.533
EVERY TRANSPORTATION DOLLAR THAT

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.167
THEY RECEIVE [inaudible]

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.502
HI.

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:34.704
I WANT TO BE CLEAR SB ONE IS A

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.372
GAME CHANGER AS WAS MENTIONED

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.139
EARLIER --

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.041
WITHOUT IT ARE TRANSPORTATION

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:39.675
NETWORKS WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.143
CRUMBLE --

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.612
THERE WAS NEVER AN EXPECTATION

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:43.779
THAT A FUNNY PACKAGE WOULD

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.681
ELIMINATE A NEARLY TWO HUNDRED

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:46.549
BILLION DOLLAR --

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.251
BACK LOG TO THE STATE AND LOCAL

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:49.185
SYSTEM --

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:50.319
BUT WE KNEW SIGNIFICANT

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:52.755
INVESTMENT WAS NEEDED TO SEND --

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:53.389
WHAT THE TAXPAYERS HAVE ALREADY

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.157
BUILT?

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.259
THEREFORE IT IS CRITICALLY

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:57.860
IMPORTANT.

01:04:57.927 --> 01:04:59.495
TO ALLOW SB WANT TO TO DO WHAT

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.963
IT WAS MEANT TO DO AND TO ALLOW

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.164
IT TO GET TO WORK --

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:03.699
AND FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO

01:05:03.766 --> 01:05:05.101
THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.036
WAS ACCOMPLISHED HERE --

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.971
INSTEAD OF ATTACHING STRINGS TO

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.106
THE FUNDING AS I KNOW --

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.274
YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME IDEAS

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.775
ABOUT THAT OUT THERE --

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:14.076
WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WAYS

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:15.945
TO STREAMLINED PROJECT DELIVERY --

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:17.179
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO REALLY

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:18.114
ENSURE CERTAINTY THAT THESE

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.582
FUNDS ARE GOING TO HIT.

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.417
THE COMMUNITIES.

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.885
LET'S FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:23.486
THERE ARE NO DELAYS TO THESE

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:24.654
FUNDS -- AND

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.122
EVERY COMMUNITIES A

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:27.990
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY CONDITION.

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.725
AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PERMITS --

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.193
THAT THEY WERE PROMISED BOTH

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.862
DURING THE PASSAGE OF SB --

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.230
ONE AND THE DEFEAT OF

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:36.032
PROPOSITION --

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:36.666
SIX SO WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.601

CITIES SAN LEANDRO --

01:05:58.187 --> 01:05:59.221

TRANSPORTATION DIRECTOR. FOR THE

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:08.964
CITY SAN LEANDRO --

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.533
THAT'S IN SENATE DISTRICT.

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:11.067
NINE AND I'VE BEEN IN THIS

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.268
BUSINESS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:12.968
NOW IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:14.937
TRANSPORTATION.

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.105
AND I CAN TELL YOU YOU KNOW

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:18.040
FIRST HAND HOW NECESSARY AND

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:19.842
REFRESHING IS TO FINALLY HAVE A

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.110
STEADY STREAM.

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:22.945
OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING TO

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.013
MAKE UP FOR THE DECADES OF

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.881
NEGLECT ON OUR LOCAL STREETS AND

01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:27.550
ROADS.

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:28.551
YOU KNOW --

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:30.453
RUNNY SAID T IS THIS THESE

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.088
FUNDS ARE GAME CHANGER --

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.023
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE END ALL

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.092
UNFORTUNATELY AND I I LIKE TO

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:38.194
MAKE THE EXAMPLE OF UP FOR LIKE

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.595
IT'S TOOL.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:40.896
YOU KNOW WE HAVE --

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:42.598
THE LOCAL FUNDING THAT NEEDS TO

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.766
BE IN PLACE.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.301
COUNTY FUNDING THAT NEED TO BE

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.069
IN PLACE THE STATE NEEDS TO DO

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:48.070
THEIR PART.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:49.472
AND EVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:52.208
NEEDS TO DO THEIR BOTH SYSTEMS

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:52.908
TO REALLY BE.

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:55.211
A PUT TOGETHER RIGHT NOW I THINK

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:56.679
WE GOT THREE LEGS OF THAT SCHOOL.

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:57.680
YOU'LL GOING IN THE RIGHT

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.749
DIRECTION SO AT LEAST WE CAN

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.317
BALANCE AND NOT --

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:04.253
YOU KNOW TIP OVER BUT WORK WE

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.689
WERE STILL WE'RE STILL SHORT.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:09.058
AND IT THE THE THE LAST TIME

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:10.693
THERE WAS A STATE INFUSION LOCAL

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.293
ROADS AND I CAN REMEMBER IT I

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.497
WAS. TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER AND I

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:16.599
PROBABLY UNLESS UNLESS GRAY HERE.

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:18.434
PUT BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.103
EIGHT AND AND A NINETY EIGHT

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.704
NINETY NINE AROUND THAT TIME

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:22.938
FRAME.

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.940
AND I WOULD I WAS MUCH YOUNGER

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:26.175
OBVIOUSLY I WAS EXCITED AND I

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.410
SAID WELL WE'RE GONNA MAKE A

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:28.310
DIFFERENCE BUT YOU KNOW BEING

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.012
YOUNG AND REALIZED IT WAS JUST

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.614
LIKE A ONE TIME INFUSION.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.749
AND ALTHOUGH WE PUMPED UP A

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:37.119
LITTLE BIT IS STILL STARTED --

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:39.054
TO TO SWIRL DOWN.

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.190
AND SO.

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:41.724
IT'S A IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.693
CHALLENGE --

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.495
AS IT WOULD SEAT FOR THE CITY

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:47.430
SAN LEANDRO THESE FUNDS ARE ARE

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:48.664
JUST NOW.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.399
STARTING TO TRICKLE IN BUT IT'S

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.201
AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORK

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.335
WERE ABLE TO CARRY OUT.

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:54.270
WILL TRY TO GIVE THE FEELING OF

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:55.104
THE MAGNITUDE OF OUR CHALLENGE

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:57.807
SAN LEANDRO THE CITY ABOUT

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:58.407
NINETY ONE THOUSAND SO YOU CAN

01:07:58.474 --> 01:07:59.275
GET THIS IN PERSPECTIVE.

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:01.510
THAT WAS INCORPORATED IN

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:02.478
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO SO YOU CAN

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:05.147
IMAGINE THAT SOME OF OUR ROADS.

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:06.882
OUR OUR OLD.

01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:08.417
AND ALTHOUGH I DO NOT BELIEVE

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:09.985
THAT WE NEGLECTED OUR ROADS I

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:11.554
THINK THAT OVER TIME WITH

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.255
STAGNANT REVENUES.

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:14.890
AND INFLATION OUR ABILITY TO

01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:17.092
MAINTAIN OUR ROADS SLOWLY

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.260
DETERIORATED ALONG WITH THE

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:20.930
ALONG WITH THE ROADS THEMSELVES

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:22.832
OVER OVER THIS TIME PERIOD --

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:23.899
WE SAW KIND OF A SMALL

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.801
RESURGENCE IN THE EIGHTIES AND

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.003
AROUND THE NINETIES WHEN ALAMEDA

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:29.638
COUNTY BECAME A SELF HELP --

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:30.873
A COUNTY.

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.274
IN THIS KIND OF PUSHED OFF OUR

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.377
OUR DOOMSDAY A LITTLE BIT LONGER --

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.545
BUT IT WAS STILL GOING TO BE

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.080
INEVITABLE BECAUSE THERE JUST

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.882
HADN'T BEEN ALL THE ADDITIONAL

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.817
GROWTH WE NEED IT --

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:43.252
WE RECENTLY --

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.788
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL DECIDED TO

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.256
INCREASE OUR SALES TAX.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:50.526
AND THEN AS PROFESSIONALS AND AS

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:52.595
WE REALLY KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:53.562
HAVE A A FIX IT FIRST AN AWESOME

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.898
PHILOSOPHY AND WHAT WE DID AND

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:56.665
SO.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.267
IN THE SUBSEQUENT --

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.970
COUNTY MEASURES AND SALES TAX

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:03.672
LOCAL AND THEN NOW EVEN WITH THE

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:06.075
SP ONE FUNDS WE REALLY TAKEN

01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:08.878
THIS TO TO HEART AND REALLY GONE

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:11.247
AFTER -- OUR

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.415
OUR LOCAL STREETS IN TRYING TO

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.917
REPAIR THEM --

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.519
AND SO --

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:19.321
JUST TO MAINTAIN OUR STREETS

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:21.524
CURRENTLY IN OUR IN OUR DISMAL

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.993
LEVEL OF OF A PCI.

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.327
FIFTY SIX WE NEED APPROXIMATELY

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.596
TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TEN

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:28.931
TO ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:31.166
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:33.435
SB ONE IN THE WHO THE MONEY --

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.938
BUT ABOUT 25% OF THAT THAT'S ONE

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.573
OF THOSE LEGS THAT WERE WERE

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.011
STANDING ON WE AS A CITY HAD --

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:43.746
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT OUR

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:45.047
PARTY IN.

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:47.216
AND THEN ALONG WITH THE THE

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.418
COUNTY FUNDS OF WE ARE ABLE TO

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:50.920
TO GARNER THOSE FUNDS TOGETHER

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:52.187
AND SO --

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:53.722
THESE LAST YEAR --

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:55.624
AND AND ALSO I THINK THE ONE

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.226
THING IS THE CERTAINTY.

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:59.862
OF THAT THE FUNDS COME IN THAT

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:01.497
WE'RE ABLE TO EVEN YOU KNOW TAKE

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:04.300
OUT THE RISK AND PUT EVEN MORE

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:06.168
OF OUR OWN GENERAL FUND MONEY.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:10.873
INTO THE POT TO TO GO OUT REPAIR

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.274
SO THIS YEAR --

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.843
WE BECAUSE OF A A LOT OF IT WAS

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:15.344

EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.088

DOLLARS.

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:30.659
AND SO.

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.728
ALL THAT MONEY COMING TOGETHER

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.263
AT THE RIGHT TIME MAKES A

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.131

CITY'S TRANSPORTATION FUNDING.

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:41.323
UNTIL AT WAS HARKEN BACK ABOUT

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:42.224
TWO YEARS AGO AT THIS TIME WE

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.293
ARE WORKING ON THE CITY BUDGET

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:46.161
FOR TRANSPORTATION --

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.796
IT WAS A REALLY GRIM TIME WHERE

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:49.932
OUR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING HAD

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.500
CONTINUE TO DECLINE --

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.302
WE HAD JUST NARROWLY MISSED

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:55.137
PASSING A SUPPLEMENTAL.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.106
TRANSPORTATION COUNTY WIDE SALES

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:59.675
TAX MEASURE AND AND SO WITH OUR

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:01.844
BUDGET WE HAD PLANT WE HAD A

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.345
BUDGET THE PLANNED ON DOING.

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:04.913
FOCUSING BASICALLY ON EMERGENCY

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.949
REPAIRS UNABLE TO DO A LOT OF

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:09.051
PROACTIVE MAINTENANCE AND WE

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:09.985
WERE LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE GONNA

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:12.521
TO FREEZE OUR MAINTENANCE STAFF

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:13.088
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO OVER THE

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:14.656
LONG TERM.

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.825
SO AM AND IN THE YEAR BEFORE SB

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:20.496
ONE PASSED WE FILLED TWENTY TWO

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.163
THOUSAND POTHOLES APPS SUCH AS

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.298
GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW WE HAD TO

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:24.767
DO SO MUCH EMERGENCY REPAIR.

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:25.901
SO IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE HIS

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:29.371
PAST A LOT HAS CHANGED --

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:31.907
LIKE MOST COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:35.177
IN AND PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE --

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.346
WHERE IT ABOUT SIXTY SIX WHICH

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:38.480
IS AROUND THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE?

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.682
BUT AND WE FOCUS ON PAVEMENT AND

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.351
RUBIO LIKE TO FOCUS THAT IT

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:43.886
REALLY DOES NOT ONLY AFFECT JUST

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:44.953
AUTOMOBILES.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.922
AUTO TRAVEL BUT ALSO OTHER FORMS

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:48.924
OF TRANSPORTATION SO OUR BUSES

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:50.259
ARE CYCLISTS.

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:51.994
NOW OUR SCOOTERS THAT WE HAVE IN

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.262
OUR CITIES --

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.329
AND IT ALSO IS A REALLY GREAT

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:56.565
OPPORTUNITY A BLANK SLATE TO

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.700
READ LOOK AT ALL THE PROBLEMS WE

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.102
HAVE WITH OUR STREETS --

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:02.104
AND A RECORD FOR THOSE AT THE

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.272
SAME TIME.

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:05.107
SO WHEN WE WHEN SB ONE PASSED

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.075
OUR FIRST PRIORITY WAS TO FOCUS

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:10.045
ON PAVEMENT REHABILITATION --

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:12.080
SO WE TOOK THE FORMULA FUNDS AND

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:14.082
THAT THE CITY RECEIVED.

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.517
IN ADDITION --

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:18.287
AS A SELF HELP COUNTY SACRAMENTO --

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:20.155
RECEIVED --

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:22.925
SOME FINDING THROUGH.

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:26.428
ARE SOME S. PRIMULA FINDING.

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:29.231
THROUGH THE LOCAL TING IN THE

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.366
LOCAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM --

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:33.335
AND THE REGION AGREED THAT WE

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.170
WOULD DIVIDE THAT UP.

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:37.306
OF PROPORTIONATELY FOR ALL OF

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:40.209
OUR MEMBERS AND ALSO TO FOCUS ON

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:42.377
A PAVEMENT REHABILITATION AND

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.112
BASICALLY STATE OF GOOD REPAIR --

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:46.081
WITH A TRANSIT SYSTEM.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.950
AND SO WE M..

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:50.385
TOOK THAT AND WE DECIDED WE WERE

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:51.954
GOING TO DO --

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.256
A SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT SO LAST

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.490
SPRING AND SUMMER WE WERE ABLE

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:57.059
TO CONTRACT OUT ABOUT TWELVE

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.927
MILLION DOLLARS IN PAVEMENT

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:01.263
REHABILITATION PROJECTS --

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.532

CONTRACTS FOR A COUPLE OF

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:15.677
REASONS --

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.346
FIRST OF ALL WE WANTED TO GET IT

WORK AROUND OUR LOCAL --

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:34.062
AND CONSTRUCTION AGENCIES --

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.764
CONSTRUCTION TEMP FIRMS AND WE

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:36.832
KNEW THAT CALTRANS WITH

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:38.000
INVESTING A LOT IN SOME OF THE

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:39.534
LARGER PROJECTS SO.

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:41.904
A LOT OF OUR LARGER THAN FIRMS

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:42.905
WOULD HAVE A LOT OF WORK WE

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:44.606
WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE WERE ABLE

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:45.807
TO START GROWING ARE.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.376
AT AND SUPPORTING SOME OF THE

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:49.611
INDUSTRY THAT CAN WORK ON THE

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:52.547
SMALLER AND MEDIUM SIZE PROJECTS --

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:53.315
SO JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.384
OF RANGE OF PROJECTS WE DID WITH

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.985
THIS FINDING THEM BECAUSE

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:57.653
SOMETIMES PAVEMENT

01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:58.820
REHABILITATION DOESN'T SOUND

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:01.023
THAT EXCITING BUT IT IS ACTUALLY

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:02.658
VERY MEANINGFUL.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.126
WE'RE ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT A

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.628
ROADWAY IN FRONT OF THEM GRANT

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:07.996
HIGH SCHOOL SO GRAND AVENUE --

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:09.564
IN ONE OF OUR SIR MAJOR URBAN

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.500
HIGH SCHOOLS AND THAT FORMERLY

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:13.635
HAD PCI OF THIRTY ANSWERABLE TO

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:15.037
RECONSTRUCT THAT.

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:16.471
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.273
THOUSANDS OF US THROUGH ITS

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.641
GRAVEL BASICALLY.

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:21.510
IT WAS A VERY VERY POOR

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:24.246
CONDITION YET THIRTIES SEC

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:26.048
THAT'S REAL OPPORTUNITY --

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:27.883
OBVIOUSLY WE HAD THOUSANDS OF OF

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.918
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THEM COMING

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.820
TO THAT EVERY DAY --

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.189
IN THE SOUTH AREA ON MACROS ME

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.457
MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT WAS

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.591
ONE OF THOSE RADWAYS THAT WE

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:37.659
ARE CONSTANTLY FILLING POTHOLES

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:40.395
WE'RE ABLE TO OVERLAY THAT'S

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:41.697
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO CONTINUE.

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.332
TO DO THE EMERGENCY REPAIRS AND

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:44.399
WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO BUILD IN SOME

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:46.668
BUFFERED BIKE LANES TO MAKE IT

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.971
SAFER FROM THE TRAVEL --

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:50.772
PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT --

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.674
IS PROBABLY MOST VISIBLE IS IN

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.543
OUR CENTRAL CITY WE HAVE ADOPTED

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.111
A PLAN TO BUILD.

01:16:56.178 --> 01:17:00.749
A SYSTEM FOR SAFER AND MORE AND

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:02.017
PROTECT LOW STRESS NETWORK FOR

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.552
BICYCLING PEDESTRIANS TO MAKE IT

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.087
EASIER TO MOVE AROUND.

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:06.788
SO WITH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:09.124
BEGIN THAT WITH OUR SB ONE FUNDS

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.593
DOING A PAYMENT MAINTENANCE AND

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.861
DEVELOPING A LOT OF OUR OUR

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:14.863
CLASS FOR PROTECTED BUFFERED

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:15.998
BIKE LANES SO.

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.332
OUR PARKING PROTECTED BY CLAIMS

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.201
WHICH YOU'LL SEE ON JAY STREET

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:21.203
INTENSE STREET WHERE THE BIKE

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:22.170
WEIGHS THE CYCLISTS ARE NOW

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:24.272
PROTECTED FROM MOVING TRAFFIC BY

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:25.574
THAT THE PARKING LANE.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.842
AND WE ALSO GOT ADDITIONAL GRANT

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:30.912
FUNDING TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM.

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:32.581
AND FINALLY AND WHAT WE NORMALLY

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:33.448
DON'T FOCUS A LOT OF ARE

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:34.149
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ON OUR

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:35.817
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:39.621
BECAUSE AND THE CARD THAT THE

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:40.756
OTHER.

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:42.024
ROADWAYS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER THE

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.392
ARTERIAL COLLECTORS HAVE HIGHER

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.726
TRAFFIC VOLUMES.

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:45.660
AS I SAID WE'RE VERY OLD CITY WE

01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:46.762
HAVE BEEN RETROFITTING A LOT OF

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.096
OUR OLDER NEIGHBORHOODS WITH

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:49.564
WATER ETERS WHICH REALLY AND

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.033
TORE UP THE PAVEMENT.

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:53.001
AND SO WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:56.438
GO AND AND REPAVE AFTER THE

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.240
WATER METER INSTALLATION. ONE OF

01:17:58.306 --> 01:17:58.874
THE BENEFITS OF DOING THAT AND

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.010
OUR OLDER NEIGHBOR BUILT MANY

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:03.145
MANY YEARS AGO SO THIS IS A

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:05.480
CHANCE TO INCORPORATE ALL THOSE

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:06.948
ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENT SO

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.483
THERE'S MOBILITY NOW ALL THE

SO -- THAT'S

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:17.526
WHAT WE DID THAT AND THAT'S KIND

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:19.494

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.108
WHAT THE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN?

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:22.310
SOME OF THE OTHER LONG RANGE OF

THE NEXT.

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:38.760
DECADE WHICH I FIND PROTECT

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:39.327
IMPORTANT SINCE I LIVE IN A

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.296
RURAL AREA.

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:43.331
THE USE THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:43.965
THERE.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:44.766
OF NEW DISHING DRIVERS WILL

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:46.468
SPEND LESS MONEY FIXING THEIR

IN ADDITIONAL SAVINGS OF SIXTY

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.248

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:02.584
BY OUR CONSULTANTS AS THEY

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.953
ANALYZE THIS AS CRASH INJURY

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:08.423
INFIDELITY WRITES A RATES WILL

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:10.392
DECLINE OVER THAT PERIOD --

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:11.826
I WAS GOING TO TALK BRIEFLY

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:13.395
ABOUT HOW WE KEY ESTIMATED THIS

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:14.195
I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER WITH

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:15.196
THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE ALL

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:15.897
LIVED THROUGH ECONOMIC.

01:22:15.964 --> 01:22:17.966
ANALYSES IN THE PAST BUT TO

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:19.834
CONCLUDE --

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:24.539
AS MENTIONED BEFORE. SIX THIRTY

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:26.708
TWO JOB YEARS OVER A DECADE.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:27.809

WERE EARNED THIRTY THREE BILLION

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:29.878
DURING THAT PERIOD.

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:34.182
TECH GROSS STATE PRODUCT WILL BE

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.551
BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR --

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.753
AND THE THE THAT I'VE MENTIONED

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.354
THE JOB.

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:41.323
RATINGS ONE LAST THING I WANT TO

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:44.526
KIND OF PERSONALIZED IS A TOUCH

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.961
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN USING OLD DATA --

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:48.096
I BY LOOK THROUGH AND SPOKE TO

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:49.998
SEVERAL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:52.867
THAT ARE PART PART OF OUR PART

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.336
OF OUR COALITION.

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:55.470
AND FIRST OFF --

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:57.038
THERE ARE PRESSURES ON THE

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:58.340
INDUSTRY THE CONSTRUCTION

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:01.042
INDUSTRY AND OUR LABOR ALLIES TO

SENATOR REQUIRE WAS INCLUDING TO

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.184
HOW DO WE FOCUS AT ON THE STATE.

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.052
THIS INFORMATION IS AREAS IS

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:12.721
PRETTY MUCH MORE GENERICALLY

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:13.822
BROADLY --

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:16.925
BROADCAST TO NOT FOCUS ON STATE

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.326
VERSUS PRIVATE SECTOR.

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:19.194
BUT THE EMPLOYMENT FOR

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.362
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IS IS

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.497
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:23.932
FASTER THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY.

01:23:23.998 --> 01:23:25.900
AND THAT'S THE BUREAU OF LABOR

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.502
STATISTICS AND THEY THINK.

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:29.237
HIM CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:30.972
OPERATORS FOR EXAMPLE.

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:34.075
THE RATE OF GROWTH WILL BE --

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:37.345
WELL OVER 12% BY.

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:38.580
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SIX SO IT'S

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:41.416
PRETTY HEALTHY INDUSTRY.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:43.451
MEDIUM ATTACK MAKIN FROM.

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:46.688
GOING TO COLLEGE AND GET THANK.

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:49.157
OTHER EVIDENCE OF OF HOW THIS IS

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:51.126
TRANSLATING IS OPERATING

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.227
ENGINEERS.

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:53.061

APPRENTICESHIPS CENTER.

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.432
THAT'S GROWING BY LEAPS AND

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:58.900
BOUNDS EACH YEAR.

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.935

WORKFORCE.

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:17.986
IS IN MOTION AND I THINK IT

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:19.654

OF DESTRUCTION I THINK YEAH.

01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:00.161
AT AVERAGE OF FIFTY FIVE IN

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:03.398
TERMS OF ROAD CONDITION

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:30.258
IS THERE ANY IDEAS OF DEALING

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:32.026

FROM --

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:53.615
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE LOOKED AT

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:54.516
WHAT THE YOUNG FUNDED --

01:25:54.582 --> 01:25:55.116
UNMET FUNDING NEEDS WOULD BE

01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:56.484
WILL BE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:57.085
WITH SB.

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:58.286
ONE AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

01:25:58.353 --> 01:25:59.988
IN MY TESTIMONY --

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:01.990
IT CONSISTENTLY EXCEED OVER

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:06.094
SEVENTY BILLION BUT THANKS SB --

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:06.728
ONE THAT ON ON MATH FUNDING NEED

01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:10.265
IS NOW.

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:11.900
ON METHADONE FUNDING NEED --

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:13.201
AND I THINK THE REAL TAKE AWAY

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:14.802
THERE IS THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:16.170
NETWORK WILL ACTUALLY MOVE INTO

01:26:16.237 --> 01:26:17.739
GOOD CONDITION.

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:18.540
BECAUSE OF THE FIX IT FOR

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.174
STRATEGY RIGHT AND SO YOU'RE

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:22.143
LOOKING AT KIND OF GETTING THE

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.112
BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK --

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:25.613

FOCUSING IN ON WHERE YOU CAN

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.219
MAXIMIZE THOSE DOLLARS AND I

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:32.654
THINK THAT THAT'S WHY WE SEE.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.189
A GOOD A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER A

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.224
PERCENTAGE OF THAT NETWORK

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:39.494
MOVING TO SET A GOOD REPAIR --

01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:40.128
BUT THE IMF FUNDING NEEDS WILL

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:41.429
STILL -- BE

01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:43.898
PRETTY LARGE AND I THINK --

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:45.767
MISTER COOK FROM SAN LEANDRO --

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.902
ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER THAT A

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.103
FEDERAL FUNDING HAS BEEN.

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:51.372
HAS CONSISTENTLY KIND OF SHRUNK

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:53.708
OVER THE YEARS IN TERMS OF HOW

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:57.679
CITIES AND COUNTIES BENEFIT FROM --

01:26:57.745 --> 01:26:58.112
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR

01:26:58.179 --> 01:27:00.949
TRANSPORTATION.

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:02.050
YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE

01:27:02.116 --> 01:27:03.518
THINGS I DID WANT TO MENTION --

01:27:03.585 --> 01:27:05.053
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.020
DONE WITH THE FUNDING IF I IF I

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:06.854
MAY.

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:10.124
UM IN ACCORDING TO THE CDC'S

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:12.894
REPORT --

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:13.528
FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN CITIES

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:14.562
AND COUNTIES --

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:16.130
WERE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THEIR

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:17.231
SB ONE SHARE --

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:18.600
THE SOME OF THE PROJECT LISTEN

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:21.102
THEREFORE BECAME ELIGIBLE --

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:22.437
BECAUSE THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.272
WAS ONLY A PARTIAL YEAR WORTH

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:25.306
WORTH OF FINDING --

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:26.741
SOME SORT OF THE ONE AND A HALF

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:28.142
BILLION THAT WE HEAR ABOUT THE

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:29.010
RIGHT GOING IT ANNUALLY TO

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.212
CITIES AND COUNTIES IS ABOUT

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:31.846
THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:32.413
THAT WENT OUT.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.148
IN THAT PARTIAL FISCAL YEAR THE

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:37.352
FOR THE VERY FIRST YEAR OF OF SB --

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:39.053
ONE OF THAT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.388
SIX MILLION A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:42.256
SIX MILLION WAS ACTUALLY SPENT --

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:43.558

BY CITIES AND COUNTIES --

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:47.595

THOU FIRST ROUND OF FIT AND IN

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:53.167
THAT FIRST FISCAL YEAR --

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:55.436
AND ANOTHER SEVENTY FOUR MILLION

PROJECTS AND SO I JUST WANT TO

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:01.709
THROW THAT OUT THERE SO THAT --

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:03.211
JUST TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THE

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:05.213
FACT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE MONEY

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:06.114
IS JUST BARELY STARTED TRICKLING

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.248
IN -- THERE

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:08.950
WAS SO MUCH WORK THAT NEEDED TO

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:09.717

MUCH MONEY GETS SPENT IN THIS.

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:23.031
FULL FISCAL YEARS WORTH OF FUNNY

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:23.865
BECAUSE IT'S ONE AND A HALF

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:25.533
MILLION VERSUS THREE HUNDRED

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.734

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.782
RISK AND I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.550
THAT RISK EVEN GOES UP IN HIGH

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:31.586
COST OF LIVING COASTAL AREAS --

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:32.520

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:51.986
REGISTRATIONS AND ALSO A ROAD

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.621
IMPROVEMENT FEE.

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:56.757
ASSESSED ON NINE ZERO EMISSION

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:58.559
VEHICLES.

01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:01.562
SO THE FIRST ARM OF THE TABLES --

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:02.430
THE THE GRAPHICS YOU'LL SEE.

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.464
IS JUST LOOKING AT THESE

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.633
DIFFERENT REVENUE SOURCES OUT

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:07.868
THROUGH TWENTY FORTY AND THE

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:10.304
COLORED BANDS REPRESENT THE FACT

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:11.005
THAT.

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:12.173
ANY PROJECTION IS A GAS AND SO

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:16.143
WE'VE TAKE SCENARIOS IN TERMS OF

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:17.812
POPULATION GROWTH --

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:20.614
INFLATION AND OTHER KEY FACTORS

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:22.416
SO YOU CAN SEE THIS SORT OF

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:24.785
CLOUD OF POSSIBILITIES DEPENDING

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:27.621
ON A A RANGE OF LIKELY FUTURES.

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:28.756
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:30.191
COLORED BANDS NOT JUST A LINE AT

01:35:30.257 --> 01:35:32.059
ANY RATE YOU WILL SEE THAT OUT

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:33.928
THROUGH TWENTY FOUR FORTY THE

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:36.764
GASOLINE TAX IS STILL BY FAR THE

01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:38.432
BIGGEST CHUNK OF MONEY.

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.868
ON AND IF YOU ADD EVERYTHING UP

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:42.670
BY TWENTY FORTY I BELIEVE IT'LL

01:35:42.736 --> 01:35:44.338
BE SOMETHING ROUGHLY AROUND

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:45.306
EIGHT NINE BILLION DOLLARS A

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:47.541
YEAR IF YOU COMBINE ALL OF THIS.

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:48.976
ON IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE BAR

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:50.511
GRAPH JUST BELOW THAT AGAIN

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.313
SHOWS YOU THAT THE RELATIVE

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:54.482
PROPORTION.

01:35:54.548 --> 01:35:56.717
OF NO IF IF EACH YEAR IS A 100%

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:57.952
OF THE MONEY THE STATE'S

01:35:58.018 --> 01:35:58.886
BRINGING IN FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:00.621
WHAT PROPORTION OF THAT.

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:02.756
IS COMING FROM SAY THE ROAD

01:36:02.823 --> 01:36:05.259
IMPROVEMENT FEE ON ZERO EMISSION

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:08.129
VEHICLES OR GASOLINE EXCISE TAX

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:09.663
IN AGAIN IS MAKES QUITE CLEAR

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:10.331
THAT.

01:36:10.397 --> 01:36:11.565
MANY PEOPLE HAVE TOLD US THE

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:13.367
GASOLINE TAXES ON ITS WAY OUR

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:15.836
ROAD AND IT'S NO LONGER WORKABLE.

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:18.005
AND I'M NOT HERE TO SAY WHETHER

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:19.540
WE SHOULD CHANGE IT OR NOT TODAY

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.142
BUT I WOULD JUST OINT OUT THAT

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.676
IT WILL STILL REYES QUITE A BIT

01:36:22.743 --> 01:36:23.577
OF REVENUE.

01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:25.613
INTO THE FUTURE EVEN IF WE

01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:29.717
DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING UNDER

01:36:29.783 --> 01:36:30.918
LIKELY SCENARIOS.

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:31.952
NOW THE NEXT THING IF YOU TURN

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:32.853
TO THE FOLLOWING PAGE THERE'S

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.255
THIS THIS FIGURE THAT SAYS DRAFT

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:36.257
ALL OVER IT BECAUSE THIS IS AN

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:38.459
ADDITIONAL PRODUCT THAT MY CO

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:39.793
AUTHORS AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.029
ON IN RESPONSE TO A VERY

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:45.166
SENSIBLE QUESTION I THOUGHT FROM --

01:36:45.232 --> 01:36:46.901
FRAN IN MEN CALIFORNIA

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:48.802
TRANSPORTATIONCOMMISSIONER WHO

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:52.773
ASKED WELL WHAT ABOUT IF WE HAVE

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.509
A MUCH FASTER PENETRATE.

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:57.778
ON HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE THE

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:59.947
PRODUCTIONS LOOKING OUT INTO THE

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:00.781
FUTURE.

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:03.851
SO WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE IS

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:05.819
WE'RE JUST ESTIMATING OVERALL

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:09.256
REVENUES WITH SORT OF IF EVEY

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:12.026
SALES JUST CONTINUED AT EXACTLY

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.661
THE RATE THEY'RE CURRENTLY GOING.

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:15.930
THAT'S OUR LOW EVEY SCENARIO AND

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.432
THEN OUR HIGH EVEY SCENARIO

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:21.769
LOOKS AT IF WE'D MET THE STATE'S

01:37:21.835 --> 01:37:23.470
CURRENT TARGETS --

01:37:23.537 --> 01:37:24.405
WHICH MEAN BY TWENTY FORTY WOULD

01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:28.142
HAVE ROUGHLY 25% OF OUR FLEET

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:29.510
WOULD BE ELECTRIC.

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:30.711
ON THIS OF THOSE OF THOSE TO

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:32.580
THOSE SORT OF BLUE AND THE

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:34.582
YELLOW LINES THE YELLOW CAN IS

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:37.318
THE THE LOW EVEY PENETRATIONS SO.

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:38.819
MORE OF OUR CARS ARE STILL

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:40.354
RUNNING ON GASOLINE WERE

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:42.723
COLLECTING THOSE GAS TAXES FROM

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.391
THEM AND DIESEL.

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:45.693
I'M TO ME STRIKING IS THAT

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:48.562
THERE'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT BIG A

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:49.863
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:50.998
LINES -- I

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:52.333
MEAN THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:53.801
ROUGHLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:55.336
HARDLY CHANGE THAT WILL SNEEZE

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:57.538
AT BUT I THINK SOMETIMES THERE'S

01:37:57.605 --> 01:38:02.743
AN A A CONCERN THAT.

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:04.178
WE KNOW IF WE WE IF WE DON'T GET

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:04.645
RID OF THE GAS TAX --

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:04.979
IF.

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:08.015
IF THE CHANGE IN.

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:10.117
A TRACE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.418
GREAT SUDDENLY WE'RE JUST HOW

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:12.086
THE FLEET THAT'S ENTIRELY

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:12.720
ELECTRIC IN THERE REALLY WON'T

01:38:12.786 --> 01:38:13.320
BE REVENUE COMING IN FROM THE

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:14.355
GASOLINE TAX.

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:16.023
AND ARE ARE THESE DRAFT

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:18.158
PROJECTIONS SO THAT NO THERE

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:19.760
WOULD STILL BE A QUITE A LOT OF

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:21.528
REVENUE COMING IN THROUGH GAS

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:22.896
AND DIESEL TAXES --

01:38:22.963 --> 01:38:24.465
ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY SOMEWHAT LESS

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:26.834
THAN IF IF WE HAD FEWER EASY'S

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:28.969
ON THE ROAD.

01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:30.304
SO THIS IS THE WORK THAT WE HAVE

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:33.040
DONE ON PROJECTIONS AND I'M

01:38:33.107 --> 01:38:35.142
HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS EITHER

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.278
HERE OR GO BACK AND DO SOME

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:38.779
ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP IF NEEDED.

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:40.214
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO TALK

01:38:40.281 --> 01:38:41.949
ABOUT S A PART TO THIS IS

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:44.752
PUBLIC OPINION ON GAS AND GAS

01:38:44.818 --> 01:38:46.153
TAXES IN MILEAGE FEES.

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:46.887
AND SO --

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:49.990
ANOTHER --

01:38:50.057 --> 01:38:51.625
WHICH I'VE DONE IN COLLABORATION

01:38:51.692 --> 01:38:54.361
WITH DR HILLARY NIXON IS NOW A

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:57.398
NINE YEAR ANNUAL SERIES OF POOLS

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:59.700
WHERE WE ASK US ADULTS SO IT'S

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:01.135
NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:02.303
THE COUNTRY.

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:03.604
WHETHER THEY WOULD SUPPORT

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:05.105
DIFFERENT VARIATIONS ON

01:39:05.172 --> 01:39:07.174
INCREASING THE FEDERAL GAS TAX

01:39:07.241 --> 01:39:08.409
RATE -- AND

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:09.810
WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:12.012
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT IT

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.213
A MILEAGE FEE.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.148
SO AGAIN THESE ARE RANDOM

01:39:14.214 --> 01:39:18.385
SURVEYS OF ADULTS IN THE US. TO

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:18.852
TWELVE HUNDRED OR MORE

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:21.055
RESPONDENTS EACH YEAR AND WE'VE

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.323
KEPT THE QUESTIONNAIRE IS

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:24.124
VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL FROM YEAR TO

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.859
YEAR SO THAT WE COULD

01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:27.394
EFFECTIVELY LOOK AT TRENDS.

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:29.563
AND SO IF YOU TURN TO THE LAST

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:32.566
GRAPHIC ON THE FINAL PAGE WHAT

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.335
WE HAVE HERE.

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:37.104
OUR PEOPLE'S SUPPORT FOR A

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:40.174
VARIETY OF OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.508
COULD INCREASE THE FEDERAL GAS

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:44.578
TAX IN ALL CASE IT WOULD BE. TEN

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.714
CENTS HIGHER SO THAT'S THE SAME

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.215
BUT AT THE BOTTOM WE HAVE OUR

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:50.284
BASE LINE WHICH IS WHERE WE JUST

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:52.920
TOLD PEOPLE. 2010% TEN CENT PER

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:53.854
GALLON INCREASE FOR

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:55.289
TRANSPORTATION.

01:39:55.356 --> 01:39:56.824
AND WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM ANY

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:58.892
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:00.327
IN ALL OF THE OTHERS IN THE LOSE

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:03.297
OF MOVING UP THE TABLE WE GAVE

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:05.733
VARIATIONS SO AT THE VERY TOP WE

01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:07.301
SAID WELL WHAT IF WE INCREASE

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:08.869
THE FEDERAL GAS TAX BY TEN CENT

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:09.837
PER GALLON.

01:40:09.903 --> 01:40:12.139
BUT WE DEDICATED THE MONEY TO

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:15.542
MAINTAINING ROADS AND HIGHWAYS.

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:18.178
ON AND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT WE

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:20.848
HAVE MUCH MUCH REALLY ALMOST

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:23.250
DOUBLE THE SUPPORT FOR THAT SAME

01:40:23.317 --> 01:40:24.818
TEN CENT PER GALLON INCREASE IN

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:26.019
THE GAS TAX.

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:27.454
IF THE MONEY WERE DEDICATED FOR

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:31.225
MAINTENANCE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:32.359
ONE OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM

01:40:32.426 --> 01:40:35.295
ME IF THIS PUBLIC POLLING IS.

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.430
BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC A RATHER

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:38.999
SENSIBLE THEY DON'T JUST ACROSS

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:40.367
THE BOARD REJECT.

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:42.369
ANY POSSIBLE TRANSPORTATION TAX

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:43.771
THEY THINK ABOUT IT --

01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:44.838
YOU KNOW IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S

01:40:44.905 --> 01:40:46.840
ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP ACHIEVE

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.842
PRIORITIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:49.743
ME -- AND I

01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:52.513
HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS OF COURSE --

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:54.481
AND SO THE THE SORT OF KEY THE

01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:56.283
MOST POPULAR VARIANTS OF THESE

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:58.018
GAS TAX INCREASES IT WE ASKED

01:40:58.085 --> 01:41:00.320
ABOUT WHERE THE MAINTENANCE --

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:03.056
ONE I JUST MENTIONED ALSO A TAX

01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:04.591
WITH REVENUE WOULD BE DEDICATED

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:07.561
FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ON AGAIN

01:41:07.628 --> 01:41:10.397
BASICALLY SUPERMAJORITY SUPPORT.

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:11.932
AND AND SOME OTHER VARIANTS IT

01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:15.536
LOOKED AT FOR EXAMPLE PROJECTS --

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:16.837
TO MONEY TO BE SPENT ON PROJECTS

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:18.439
THAT WOULD REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:20.441
EMISSIONS OR AIR POLLUTANTS ALSO

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:22.409
QUITE POPULAR WITH MAJORITY

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:23.510
SUPPORT.

01:41:23.577 --> 01:41:25.012
SO THAT'S AGAIN ONE OF MY KEY

01:41:25.078 --> 01:41:26.180
TAKE AWAYS IS THIS FACT THAT

01:41:26.246 --> 01:41:28.782
PEOPLE DON'T TREAT ALL TAXES THE

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:29.983
SAME THEY THINK ABOUT IT IN SOME

01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:32.386
THEY WILL SOME EVERYBODY HATES

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:33.387
MORE LESS THAN OTHERS.

01:41:33.454 --> 01:41:36.590
QUITE A MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:37.591
ACTUALLY COULD SUPPORT.

01:41:37.658 --> 01:41:38.459
THE LAST FINDING I'LL POINT OUT

01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:39.660
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SHOWING YOU

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:41.795
HERE IN THIS CASE IS THE RESULTS

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:42.996
FROM ASKING THESE IDENTICAL

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.832
SURVEY QUESTIONS OVER A NUMBER

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:46.600
OF YEARS.

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.569
AND THE THE SORT OF IT IN THE

01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:50.604
BOTTOM OF EACH SECTION THE THE

01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:52.806
WHITISH COLOR BAR THAT'S GOING

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.942
BACK TO TWENTY TEN AND THEN

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:56.009
SERVE AS YOU MARCH UP WE'RE

01:41:56.076 --> 01:41:57.344
GETTING CLOSER TO THE FUTURE.

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:59.446
AND IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY CASE

01:41:59.513 --> 01:42:00.581
FOR EVERYONE OF THESE TAX

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:02.883
VARIANTS SUPPORT HAS INCREASED

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.319
SINCE.

01:42:05.385 --> 01:42:07.087
TWENTY TEN AND YOU KNOW VERY

01:42:07.154 --> 01:42:10.224
ROUGHLY IT'S BEEN JUST INCREASE

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.291
WITH SOME HICK UPS HERE AND

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:13.060
THERE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE QUITE A

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:14.795
STEADY PATTERN ACROSS ALL OF THE

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.730
TAXES -- AND

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:19.132
WE WE DON'T HAVE OUR TWENTY

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:19.766
EIGHTEEN DATA SHOWING HERE BUT

01:42:19.833 --> 01:42:21.401
IT WAS WOULD HAVE TOO MUCH OF A

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.570
BOB UP BUMP UP BUT IT WAS THE

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:25.472
SAME GENERAL PATTERN NOW I CAN'T

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:27.007
TELL YOU OR HITTING A PEAK AND

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:28.408
THINGS WILL CHANGE --

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:30.477
NEXT YEAR BUT CERTAINLY OVER THE

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:32.045
LAST YEAR'S THERE SEEMS TO JUST

01:42:32.112 --> 01:42:33.313
BE THIS GRADUAL.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:34.715
MORE AND MORE OF THE POPULATION

01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:37.050
ACCEPTING THAT THEY WOULD VALUE

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:38.519
IMPROVING OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:41.488
SYSTEM EVEN IF THAT MEANS

01:42:41.555 --> 01:42:42.956
SPENDING MORE.

01:42:43.023 --> 01:42:44.725
SO THOSE REMARKS I HAD PREPARED

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:47.327
AND ANY QUESTIONS I'LL WAIT

01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:50.964
UNTIL OF THE NEXT BAKER AND WILL

01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:53.267
ASK US QUESTIONS OF THE PEOPLE

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.068
OF KOSOVO TURN OVER TO THE LAST

01:42:55.135 --> 01:42:56.803
SPEAKER FOR TODAY.

PART OF SB --

01:43:11.618 --> 01:43:13.787
ONE HAD A INCREASE IN --

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:14.922
OR INTRODUCTION OF A NEW ANNUAL

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:16.156
REGISTRATION FEE FOUR ZERO

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:17.958
EMISSION VEHICLES --

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:20.127
AND SO SB ONE PASSED --

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:21.895
UC DAVIS --

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:23.630
WITH STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:26.166
THIS PARTICULAR FEE AND POSSIBLE

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:27.734
OCT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:28.435
MECHANISMS --

01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:31.104
AND SO I WAS THE PRINCIPAL

01:43:31.171 --> 01:43:31.705
INVESTIGATOR FOR THE FOR THIS

01:43:31.772 --> 01:43:35.309
PROJECT WHICH STUDY WHICH WHICH

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:36.577
YOU HAVEN'T IN FRONT OF YOU AND

01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:38.912
PRE FOR VERSION OF THAT AS A AS

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:41.949
A POLICY BRIEF COM WHICH IS ALSO

01:43:42.015 --> 01:43:45.819
PROVIDED THANK YOU --

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:47.421
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE KEY

01:43:47.487 --> 01:43:48.589
ASPECTS --

01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:49.656
AND DRAWBACKS THAT THAT WE

01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:51.058
ACTUALLY FOUND WITH WITH THE

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:53.193
REGISTRATION FEE --

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.596
IS THAT --

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:57.831
WITH GASOLINE VEHICLE --

01:43:57.898 --> 01:43:59.266
THE THE WAY THAT YOU CONTRIBUTE

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:00.467
TO FUNDING ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:02.536
IS IS THROUGH THE GAS TAX AND SO

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.504
THE MORE THAT YOU DRIVE --

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:06.573
THE MORE THAT YOU PAY --

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.208
AND WITH THOSE THAT HAVE ANNUAL

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:09.476
REGISTRATION FEE THIS DEPARTS

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:10.611
FROM THE USER PAYS PRINCIPLE

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:12.279
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:14.181
DRIVE A THOUSAND MILES A YEAR OR

01:44:14.247 --> 01:44:15.882
TEN THOUSAND MILES A YEAR --

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:16.550
YOU'RE NOW PAYING THE SAME

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:17.951
AMOUNT --

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:19.686
AND SO FROM --

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:21.154
EQUITY STANDPOINT --

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:25.359
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THERE.

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:26.760
THE SECOND DRAWBACK --

01:44:26.827 --> 01:44:29.596
THAT THAT WE USE HAD IDENTIFIED --

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:30.297
WHICH WAS --

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:32.132
BROUGHT UP A BIT AND LOOK IN THE

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:34.735
LAST TESTIMONY WHAT CREATION FEE

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.003
ITSELF IS IS NOT ENTIRELY

01:44:36.069 --> 01:44:37.404
SUSTAINABLE SO THE AVERAGE

01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:39.840
VEHICLE IN CALIFORNIA PAYS ABOUT

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:41.808
A HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS A YEAR --

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:43.543
AND THE ANNUAL REGISTRATION FEE

01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:44.578
IS ABOUT HALF THAT SAYS YOU

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:46.213
TRANSITION MORE AND MORE TO

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:47.581
ELECTRIC VEHICLES YOU ARE SORT

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:49.082
OF DECREASING --

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:50.751
THE REVENUE BEING PROVIDED FOR

01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:52.085
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:53.420
AND AND WE DO HAVE SIMILAR

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:55.856
FINDINGS TO TO WHAT PROFESSOR I

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:57.791
ROLL WAS STATING BY TWENTY

01:44:57.858 --> 01:44:59.359
THIRTY IF WE ME CALIFORNIA'S --

01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:01.595
FIVE MILLION --

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:02.462
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE

01:45:02.529 --> 01:45:03.630
ROAD --

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:05.499
THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO ABOUT A

01:45:05.565 --> 01:45:06.833
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN IN

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.603
SHORTFALL IN REVENUE --

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.805
COMPARED TO WHAT IT WOULD BE

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:14.074
THAT THEY HAVE THERE BEEN

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:16.009
GASOLINE VEHICLES.

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:16.677
OUR IN TERMS OF THE ALTERNATIVE

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:18.311
MECHANISMS --

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:19.513
WE IDENTIFIED --

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:21.982
AND STUDIED TO IN PARTICULAR SO

01:45:22.049 --> 01:45:23.483
ONE IS A FUEL TAX THAT WOULD BE

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.218
SIMILAR IN OPERATION TO A

01:45:25.285 --> 01:45:27.387
GASOLINE TAX AND SO --

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:28.622
FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES YOU WOULD

01:45:28.689 --> 01:45:30.624
CHARGE A SPECIAL TAX FOR

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:32.325
LECTURES THE IN FOR HYDROGEN THE

01:45:32.392 --> 01:45:34.327
SPECIAL TAX REDUCTION --

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:36.229
UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW IT IN

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:38.131
TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION THIS CAN

01:45:38.198 --> 01:45:40.534
BE A VERY DIFFICULT TASK --

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.370
PARTICULARLY FOR ELECTRICITY --

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:43.970
WHEN WHEN YOU PLUG IN ELECTRIC

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:46.206
THE?

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:47.941
IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS A SPECIFIC

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:49.643
TAX FOR THE VEHICLE YOU HAVE TO

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:51.745
TRACK THE ELECTRICITY GOING IN --

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:53.680
AND AND YOU'RE MEASURING THAT

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:54.448
COMPARED TO YOU HAVING

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:55.849
ELECTRICITY GOING TO LIGHTS OR

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:57.250
OTHER APPLIANCES IS VERY

01:45:57.317 --> 01:45:58.285
DIFFICULT YOU NEED A SEPARATE

01:45:58.351 --> 01:45:59.519
METER AND AND THAT IS ALMOST A

01:45:59.586 --> 01:46:00.821
NON STARTER FOR PROGRAM LIKE

01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:02.022
THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE.

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:03.623
WAY TOO EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT A

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:05.459
SEPARATE METERING FOR FOR ALL

01:46:05.525 --> 01:46:07.294
VEHICLES --

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.628
THE OTHER --

01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:09.663
FEEDBACK IN THIS IN WHICH WE

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:11.698
EXAMINE WAS THAT ROAD USER

01:46:11.765 --> 01:46:13.633
CHARGE OR A OR OR MILEAGE FEE

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:14.501
WHICH IS WHERE YOU PAY BY THE

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:15.969
MILE AND AND THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:17.104
SOMETHING THAT --

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:18.872
CALIFORNIA AND AND CALTRANS HAS

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:20.173
BEEN INVESTIGATING --

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.242
PARTICULARLY THROUGH --

01:46:22.309 --> 01:46:24.311
SB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH WAS --

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:25.645
A PILOT FOR THAT FOR THE ROAD

01:46:25.712 --> 01:46:26.947
USER CHARGING AND HAS NOW

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:28.482
CONCLUDED --

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:31.084
IN IN WORKING WITH CALTRANS AND

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:32.652
AND THE CDC WE ACTUALLY

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:34.054
DISCOVERED A A SORT OF UNIQUE

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:35.622
OPPORTUNITY THROUGH ELECTRIC

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:38.191
VEHICLES FOR IMPLEMENTATION --

01:46:38.258 --> 01:46:39.793
OF OF A ROCK --

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.663
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL SORT OF

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:46.733
BENEFITS THAT COME FROM FOR

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.002
ELECTRIC VEHICLES --

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.637
SO FIRST THAT THE TECHNOLOGY

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:52.639
INTERMISSION VEHICLES IS IS A

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:55.475
LOT NEWER AND WE CAN LEVERAGE

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.043
SOME THE TELEMATICS SYSTEMS ON

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:59.813
BOARD THESE VEHICLES --

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.614
TO TO THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:01.782
MECHANISM --

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:02.816
OF A ROCK --

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:05.218
AND THAT WILL HELP SOLVE SOME OF

01:47:05.285 --> 01:47:06.820
THE ASSOCIATE COST

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.822
ADMINISTRATION --

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:10.357
FOR HARDWARE THAT THAT THAT ARE

01:47:10.423 --> 01:47:12.459
USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ROCKS

01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:13.860
AND USUALLY THEY USE THAT THESE

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:15.962
ON BOARD EXTERNAL DEVICES --

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:18.965
THAT PLUG INTO THE OBD.

01:47:19.032 --> 01:47:20.333
IN IN THE VEHICLE.

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.803
AND THAT CAN BE ENTIRELY AVOIDED --

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:24.538
SECONDLY IN IN A LOT OF THE

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:26.940
PROGRAMS FOR ROCKS THAT EXIST

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:29.276
TODAY MAINLY PILOT PROGRAMS YOU

01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:31.244
HAVE THIS ISSUE WHERE VEHICLES

01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:33.180
ARE VOLUNTEERING FOR THESE

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:35.582
PROGRAMS PARTICIPATING IN A ROCK --

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:37.150
WHERE THEY PAY BY THE MILE BUT

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:38.418
THEN ANY TIME THEY GET TO A GAS

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:39.452
STATION THEY'RE ALSO PAYING A

01:47:39.519 --> 01:47:41.288
GAS TAX WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO

01:47:41.354 --> 01:47:43.023
GET CREDITED BACK --

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:43.790
THE MONEY BECAUSE OF THE DOUBLE

01:47:43.857 --> 01:47:45.125
PAYMENT WITH THE ELECTRIC

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:49.129
VEHICLES --

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:51.531
YOU TO AVOID THIS ISSUE ENTIRELY

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:53.567
THIS IS THAT WITH WITH THE VISA

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:54.801
AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:56.803
BECAUSE THE VOLUMES ARE SO MUCH

01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:58.171
LOWER THAN THAT SORT OF GENERAL

01:47:58.238 --> 01:47:59.873
POPULATION OF VEHICLES THE

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.976
TRANSITION TOWARDS THESE --

01:48:03.043 --> 01:48:04.311
TOWARDS A ROCK SYSTEM FOR THIS

01:48:04.377 --> 01:48:05.979
PARTICULAR SUBSET OF VEHICLES

01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:08.148
WOULD BE MUCH SMALLER AND AND

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:11.351
EASIER TO IMPLEMENT.

01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:12.485
AND THEN LASTLY --

01:48:12.552 --> 01:48:13.320
IN IN TERMS OF SORT OF LONGER

01:48:13.386 --> 01:48:15.288
TERM GOALS --

01:48:15.355 --> 01:48:16.857
IF THERE IS A SYSTEM THAT IN

01:48:16.923 --> 01:48:18.892
THAT IS ABLE TO COUPLE THE

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:20.026
TELEMATICS --

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:22.662
AND AND IN AN INTEGRATED WAY --

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:24.331
THAT ACTUALLY ENABLES POTENTIAL

01:48:24.397 --> 01:48:26.199
FUTURE PRICING MECHANISMS AND SO

01:48:26.266 --> 01:48:27.033
IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.201
WE THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:30.036
CONGESTION PRICING --

01:48:30.103 --> 01:48:32.172
OCCUPANCY PRICING --

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:34.074
AND YOU KNOW IT IN EACH OF THE

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.242
SYSTEMS.

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:36.142
IMPLEMENTATION IS ALWAYS A

01:48:36.209 --> 01:48:37.611
CHALLENGE --

01:48:37.677 --> 01:48:39.145
AND HAVING EVERYTHING IN IN AN

01:48:39.212 --> 01:48:41.248
INNER INTEGRATED WAY MAY PROVE

01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:42.749
TO BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:44.050
ALLOWS FOR THESE --

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:45.752
PRICING MECHANISMS THAT HAPPEN

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.020
IN THE FUTURE --

01:48:47.087 --> 01:48:49.322
AND SO -- IN

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:52.092
SUMMARY IN THE REPORT AND WE

01:48:52.158 --> 01:48:53.760
PROVIDE SOME QUALITATIVE

01:48:53.827 --> 01:48:55.061
ANALYSIS ABOUT.

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:56.296
THE RELATIVE STRENGTH AND

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:58.965
BENEFITS OF THE OF THE DIFFERENT --

01:48:59.032 --> 01:49:00.133
PRICING MECHANISMS AS AN

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.468
ALTERNATIVE TO THE ANNUAL

01:49:01.534 --> 01:49:03.770
REGISTRATION FEE --

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:05.839
YEAH AND AND THAT CONCLUDES MY

01:49:05.906 --> 01:49:08.041
MY TESTIMONY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:10.510
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS --

01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:14.080
JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:18.685
ACADEMICS --

01:49:18.752 --> 01:49:22.522
WHEN WE DID WHEN WE DID SB --

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:26.459
ONE WE STARTED --

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:29.362
THE CONCEPT OF DOING THE

01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:30.897
RESEARCH TO AID.

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:32.565
THE DELIVERY OF SP ONE AND HOW

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:33.934
WE WERE.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.136
THE CUSTOMER DOING RESEARCH WAS

01:49:36.202 --> 01:49:39.506
MORE APPLYING IT TO CALIFORNIA.

01:49:39.572 --> 01:49:40.974
TO TO THE WISE CHOICES THAT WE

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:42.375
NEED TO MAKE IN THE FUTURE.

01:49:42.442 --> 01:49:44.444
AND HAVING SOME BACKGROUND ON

01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:46.579
OUR OUR BILL EVER ARE IN DE ON

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:49.316
OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS --

01:49:49.382 --> 01:49:50.483
JUST -- THIS

01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:52.319
IS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT YOU'RE

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:53.687
TELLING US RIGHT NOW SO WE DON'T

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:54.654
KNOW.

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:55.588
HOW DO WE DO THAT ON --

01:49:55.655 --> 01:49:57.357
WHAT WHAT KIND OF MEANS YOU

01:49:57.424 --> 01:49:58.558
THINK WE SHOULD DO?

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:05.131
ON A CONSISTENT ON GOING --

01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:06.633
IS THAT YOU GIVE US REPORTS AND

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.402
STUFF OF HOW HOW WOULD YOU LOOK

01:50:09.469 --> 01:50:13.773
AT COMMUNICATING WITH POLICY

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.709
MAKERS LIKE MYSELF AND AND MY MY

01:50:15.775 --> 01:50:16.676
COLLEAGUES.

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:18.945
IN THE FUTURE ON HOW TO MAKE THE

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:21.014
RIGHT CHOICES ON SOME OF THESE

01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:23.583
ISSUES HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:23.883
[inaudible]

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:27.954
YOUR YEAH --

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:28.888
SO.

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:30.857
SB ONE PROVIDES A A LARGE

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:32.826
PROPORTION OF FUNDING NOW FOR

01:50:32.892 --> 01:50:33.927
FOR SOME OF THIS RESEARCH AND I

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:35.028
THINK OPEN LINES OF

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:36.596
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICY

01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:39.499
MAKERS AND AND THE ROOF --

01:50:39.566 --> 01:50:41.267
IN TERMS OF RESEARCH NEEDS I

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:43.770
THINK IS IS CRITICAL FOR THE WAY

01:50:43.837 --> 01:50:45.772
THAT WE AS AS RESEARCHERS THAT

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.807
AT LEAST AT UC DAVIS AT OUR

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:48.975
INSTITUTE --

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:52.345
THE WAY THAT WE RECEIVE FUNDS IS --

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:56.750
WE WE HAVE THESE IN TURN --

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:59.486
AND THE THE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES

01:50:59.552 --> 01:51:00.520
ARE SERVE LEFT UP TO THE

01:51:00.587 --> 01:51:01.955
DISCRETION OF THE RESEARCHERS

01:51:02.022 --> 01:51:04.224
BUT BUT I THINK REALLY --

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:05.592
CRITICAL WOULD BE --

01:51:05.658 --> 01:51:06.726
YOU KNOW.

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:08.028
APPROACHES FROM --

01:51:08.094 --> 01:51:10.296
THE THE LEGISLATURE AND FROM

01:51:10.363 --> 01:51:12.966
FROM AGENCIES SUCH AS THE

01:51:13.033 --> 01:51:14.234
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION YOU

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:16.002
KNOW COMING TO US WITH SPECIFIC

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:17.837
RESEARCH NEEDS THAT COULD THEN

01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:18.405
BE.

01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:19.873
YOU KNOW TOPICS THAT THAT COULD

01:51:19.939 --> 01:51:22.976
BE USED AS AS PROPOSALS --

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:25.812
FOR FOR FUNDING I THINK WOULD BE --

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:27.814
VERY MUCH BENEFICIAL TO SORT OF

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:29.883
COORDINATES --

01:51:29.949 --> 01:51:34.654
THE NEEDS AND AND WHAT WE'RE

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:37.323
JUST TO ECHO WHAT DOCTOR DONE

01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:38.625
TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE

01:51:38.691 --> 01:51:40.927
CURRENTLY DOES COMMUNICATE WITH

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:42.295
THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:44.230
COMMISSION WITH CALTRANS ON WITH

01:51:44.297 --> 01:51:45.331
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND

01:51:45.398 --> 01:51:46.166
THAT'S BEEN.

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:48.068
REALLY HELPFUL IN HELPING US

01:51:48.134 --> 01:51:49.436
FIGURE OUT WHAT RESEARCH MIGHT

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:52.072
BE USEFUL SO I THINK MORE AND

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:53.673
CONTINUED SUPPORT LIKE THAT

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.608
WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE --

01:51:55.675 --> 01:51:57.143
AT THE SAME TIME I I THINK IT'S

01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.311
USEFUL TO LEAVE SOME OF THE

01:51:58.378 --> 01:51:59.879
MONEY MORE TO THE DISCRETION OF

01:51:59.946 --> 01:52:02.515
THE THE RESEARCHERS WHO MAY HAVE

01:52:02.582 --> 01:52:03.583
BRIGHT IDEAS THAT.

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:04.984
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN THIS

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:06.052
GIVE THEM A CHANCE FOR A TRAINED

01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:06.853
DEMONSTRATE THAT.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.688
AND THEN THE FINAL THING IS I

01:52:08.755 --> 01:52:09.522
WOULD SAY IN THIS IS IS SORT OF

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:11.458
GETS. TO THE WAY UNIVERSITIES

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:15.595
OPERATE FACULTY ARE OFTEN NOT.

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:17.363
GIVEN THE SORT OF THE FUNDING

01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:19.799
AND THIS THE MORAL SUPPORT TO GO

01:52:19.866 --> 01:52:21.367
OUT AND SHARE THEIR FINDINGS

01:52:21.434 --> 01:52:22.769
WITH THE PUBLIC DOES VERY

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:23.770
INSULAR WORLD OF PROFESSORS

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:25.338
TALKING TO PROFESSORS WHICH I

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:27.040
THINK IS UNHELPFUL --

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:29.576
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:30.610
STATE.

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:33.213
AS IT FUNDS UNIVERSITY RESEARCH

01:52:33.279 --> 01:52:36.049
WANTS TO VERY EXPLICITLY STATE

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:39.252
THAT IT IS AN EXPECTATION THAT

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:40.854
THE AUTHORS WILL SERVE

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:42.388
ENERGETICALLY.

01:52:42.455 --> 01:52:46.893
SPEAK AT PUBLIC SERVING EVENTS

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.628
WOULD I THINK BE HELPFUL YES YES

01:52:48.695 --> 01:52:50.497
WITH THIS AND COMMUNITY MEETINGS

01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:51.698
AND AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:53.399
THE I I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:54.601
THAT -- ANY

01:52:54.667 --> 01:52:56.469
NOTION THAT --

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:58.204
THAT NEW WITH THIS MONEY IS IS

01:52:58.271 --> 01:52:59.305
BEING USED FOR SORT OF NOW

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:00.373
PUBLIC GOOD AND AND

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.541
DISSEMINATING THE RESEARCH AND

01:53:01.608 --> 01:53:05.044
INTO THE PUBLIC I THINK WOULD BE.

01:53:05.111 --> 01:53:06.379
VERY VERY CRITICAL.

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:09.516
YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN I CAME

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:12.619
HERE THERE WAS NO REASON.

01:53:12.685 --> 01:53:14.287
SO WHEN WE PUT SB ONE TOGETHER

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:15.555
WE SAID WELL.

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:17.423
LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOME

01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:18.024
RESEARCH BECAUSE WE FOUND OUT

01:53:18.091 --> 01:53:20.360
THE AND YOU MIGHT KNOW THE

01:53:20.426 --> 01:53:21.895
STATE'S --

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:23.663
SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE MORE

01:53:23.730 --> 01:53:25.231
VIGOROUS ACADEMIC RESEARCH

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:26.299
FUNDED BY THE STATE

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:28.501
TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES I THINK.

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:30.603
TAXES IS THE FAMOUS ONE THEY

01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:31.704
HAVE.

01:53:31.771 --> 01:53:33.339
THE TEXAS TRANSPORTATION

01:53:33.406 --> 01:53:35.008
INSTITUTE RYDEN.

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:37.510
OHIO AND MICHIGAN SOME OF THE

01:53:37.577 --> 01:53:38.745
STATE SO BIG.

01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:40.880
I DON'T KNOW BUT WE'RE WE WERE

01:53:40.947 --> 01:53:42.182
WE HAD WE HAD CREATED THESE

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:43.783
INSTITUTES.

01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:46.486
BASICALLY BECAUSE THE CONGRESS

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:49.689
RIDE WITH A CONGRESSMAN MINETA.

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:51.724
IS THE IN IN THE BILL HE WROTE

01:53:51.791 --> 01:53:52.892
CREATED THESE.

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:54.694
NATIONAL ACADEMIC TRANSPORTATION

01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:56.529
INSTITUTE'S ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:57.530
AND I THINK CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

01:53:57.597 --> 01:54:00.333
WHAT SEVEN OF THEM.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.001
NUMBER KEEPS SAYING I DON'T KNOW

01:54:02.068 --> 01:54:03.803
THERE'S A NUMBER.

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:05.939
A YEAR TO YEAR TWO OF MY NO

01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:08.508
DAVIS AND THE NET INSTITUTES AS

01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:09.909
A STATE.

01:54:09.976 --> 01:54:12.679
WITHIN THEIR SERVICE I THINK --

01:54:12.745 --> 01:54:14.948
OF SEVERAL.

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:18.151
SEE ISSUE AND STE AND SEVERAL UC

01:54:18.218 --> 01:54:19.786
BERKELEY.

01:54:19.852 --> 01:54:22.722
UCLA AND SO FORTH RIVERSIDE I

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:26.125
BELIEVE --

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:31.197
IRVINE I BELIEVE YOU SEE A RUN.

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:32.565
FOR A SO SO --

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:33.766
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:35.201
DISCUSSION OF LIKE HOW WE CAN

01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:41.241
SUPPORT YOUR INSTITUTES ON

01:54:41.307 --> 01:54:43.643
ALLOCATION THAT'S GIVEN AND THEN.

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.245
AND THEN I AGREE WITH YOU THE

01:54:45.311 --> 01:54:47.747
CONNECTION IS VERY VITAL FOR US

01:54:47.814 --> 01:54:50.450
IS POLICYMAKERS --

01:54:50.516 --> 01:54:52.051
TO LOOK AT THE RESEARCH AND HAVE

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:53.152
IT PRESENTED.

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:54.754
BOTH BOOKED AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:55.555
BUT ALSO AT THE LOCAL

01:54:55.622 --> 01:54:56.556
GOVERNMENTS ALL THOSE LOCAL

01:54:56.623 --> 01:54:57.857
GOVERNMENT PEOPLE.

01:54:57.924 --> 01:55:00.026
COMING UP TO CITY COUNCILS THE

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:02.095
PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTORS THE

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:02.962
REGIONAL.

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:07.367
COVER AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES --

01:55:07.433 --> 01:55:09.369
THOUGH CALTRANS --

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:11.271
STAFF MEETINGS PRESENTING

01:55:11.337 --> 01:55:14.807
RESEARCH TO THE STAFF AT

01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:16.342
CALTRANS THE WITH THE PEOPLE

01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:17.043
THAT DO.

01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:19.646

01:55:19.712 --> 01:55:21.214
HELP THEM DO THEIR JOBS BETTER I

01:55:21.281 --> 01:55:23.950
THINK ALL THAT. FOR THE FOR THE

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:24.817
BUSINESS OF BUILDING OUR

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.252
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM I THINK

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:27.854
IT'S VITAL THAT WE HAVE THAT

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:29.656
RESEARCH.

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:32.125
SO I ALL OF THE WORKING WITH YOU

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:35.228

AND GET IDEAS FROM ANYBODY THAT

01:55:36.296 --> 01:55:37.130
WOULD LIKE TO COMMUNICATE WITH

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:09.696
VEHICLES.

01:56:09.762 --> 01:56:11.664
IT IS EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:15.101
CHEAP TO ADMINISTER RIGHT --

01:56:15.168 --> 01:56:18.705
AND FORWARD --

01:56:18.771 --> 01:56:20.506
I I I I WILL SAY FOR THE FOR THE

CALTRANS

01:56:27.947 --> 01:56:28.715
IS WORKING WITH THE WITH THE

ROAD USER CHARGE AND AND I

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:31.584

BE -- A

01:56:32.518 --> 01:56:34.153
PILOT HAPPENING IN THE NEAR

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.755
FUTURE THAT WILL THERE'S GONNA

01:56:35.822 --> 01:56:37.056
BE SEVERAL PILES BUT ONE OF THE

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:38.991
PILOTS IS TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY

01:56:39.058 --> 01:56:40.526
AT THIS IMPLEMENTATION FOR

01:56:40.593 --> 01:56:42.462
ELECTRIC VEHICLES --

01:56:42.528 --> 01:56:45.631
AND SO YEAH I THINK THAT'LL BE A

01:56:45.698 --> 01:56:47.667
PROMISE LIST KEEP WORKING ON

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:49.035
THAT THAT'LL BE THE WAY AND I

01:56:49.102 --> 01:56:49.936
KNOW.

01:56:50.002 --> 01:56:53.005
YOU'RE LOOKING AT DOING ACADEMIC

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:55.942
RESEARCH AT THE MINUTE IS --

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.243
TO TERMS OF REVENUES CAN YOU

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:58.878
KIND OF GO OVER WHAT OTHER KINDS

01:56:58.945 --> 01:56:59.679
OF THINGS YOU'RE DOING I'M SHORT

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:01.080
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING

01:57:01.147 --> 01:57:03.349
OUR NATIONAL ANNUAL SURVEY WE'RE

01:57:03.416 --> 01:57:05.418
GOING TO BE STARTING UP WELL.

01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:07.220
WE'RE DOING A CALIFORNIA FOCUSED

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:08.788
TRANSPORTATION SURVEY TO FIND

01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.189
OUT WHAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:57:10.256 --> 01:57:12.658
THINKS ABOUT VARIETY OF TOPICS

01:57:12.725 --> 01:57:14.694
AN ESSENTIALLY CAN DO THIS IS AN

01:57:14.761 --> 01:57:17.397
ANNUAL TREND AS WELL.

01:57:17.463 --> 01:57:18.898
ON ONE THING BECAUSE I'VE ALSO

01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:20.266
WORKED OVER THE YEARS THINKING

01:57:20.333 --> 01:57:22.769
ABOUT MILEAGE FEES IS I KNOW

01:57:22.835 --> 01:57:25.838
THAT MY ONE CONCERN IS THEY'RE

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:28.074
NOT SUPER POPULAR AND SO JUST

01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:29.175
HAVING.

01:57:29.242 --> 01:57:32.044
EVEY OWNERS PAY THEM ALMOST CAN

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:34.614
SEEM LIKE A PENALTY ON PEOPLE

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.516
WHO OWN ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHICH

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:38.217
IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO THE

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:39.385
STATE'S GOALS OF ENCOURAGING

01:57:39.452 --> 01:57:44.257
MORE PEOPLE --

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:44.757
AND SO THAT WILL JUST BE

01:57:44.824 --> 01:57:48.227
SOMETHING ALONG WITH THE MILEAGE

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:48.661
FEED.

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:51.764
IT OCCURS TO ME THAT WE HAVE YOU

01:57:51.831 --> 01:57:54.033
EVER MORE ESSENTIALLY CORPORATE

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:57.470
FLEETS OF VEHICLES AND DIFFERENT.

01:57:57.537 --> 01:58:00.106
GUISES WHETHER THAT'S UPS TRUCKS

01:58:00.173 --> 01:58:01.607
OR LIFT DRIVERS.

01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:03.709
AND COLLECTING SAY A MILEAGE FEE

01:58:03.776 --> 01:58:04.877
FROM ALL THESE VEHICLES WHICH

01:58:04.944 --> 01:58:07.547
ARE ALREADY BEING TRACKED

01:58:07.613 --> 01:58:09.148
THEY'RE ALL ARE READY YOU KNOW

01:58:09.215 --> 01:58:10.616
GPS IS TELLING US WHERE THEY GO

01:58:10.683 --> 01:58:11.684
AND WHEN.

01:58:11.751 --> 01:58:13.152
AND IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:15.388
MATTER OF THE STATE COLLECTING

01:58:15.455 --> 01:58:17.323
THOSE REVENUES YOU KNOW FROM A

01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:19.592
HANDFUL OF LARGE COMPANIES NOT

01:58:19.659 --> 01:58:21.127
HAVING TO DEAL WITH.

01:58:21.194 --> 01:58:23.729
A BILL TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN.

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:25.698
COULD BE A VERY ADMINISTRATIVE

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:26.599
FULLY.

01:58:26.666 --> 01:58:28.868
EASY WAY TO IMPLEMENT MILEAGE

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:30.670
FEES TO SORT OF START WITH THAT

01:58:30.736 --> 01:58:32.104
PORTION OF THE FLEET.

01:58:32.171 --> 01:58:33.272
AND ALSO I THINK FROM THE

01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:35.308
PUBLIC'S PERSPECTIVE I MEAN I

01:58:35.374 --> 01:58:36.542
PAY MY MY LISTS.

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:38.044
THE WHATEVER IT IS I DON'T THINK

01:58:38.110 --> 01:58:39.412
ABOUT WHAT PERCENTAGES TAXES AND

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:40.880
WHAT PERCENTAGE IS GOING TO THE

01:58:40.947 --> 01:58:42.448
DRIVER AND ALL OF THAT --

01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:45.284
AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST A WAY

01:58:45.351 --> 01:58:45.985
THAT.

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:47.987
YOU KNOW JUST GETS WORKED INTO

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:50.056
THE PRICE FOR THE NEWMAN MY UPS

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:51.657
PACKAGE COMES ARE I TAKE MY

01:58:51.724 --> 01:58:52.792
LISTER OVERRIDE.

01:58:52.859 --> 01:58:55.561
SO IT'S NOT I THINK MAYBE AS

01:58:55.628 --> 01:58:58.197
WORRY.

01:58:58.264 --> 01:59:00.299
TAX IS JUST PART OF WHAT I PAY I

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:01.734
PAY TWENTY DOLLARS A SIXTY

01:59:01.801 --> 01:59:03.169
DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IF. TO FILL

01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:04.704
UP MY TANK AND I DON'T WORRY

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:06.572
ABOUT BUDGETING FOR THE GAS TAX

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:09.242
OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST.

01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:11.110
IT'S INVISIBLE MORE LAST SO

01:59:11.177 --> 01:59:12.512
AGAIN I THINK THERE'S SOME.

01:59:12.578 --> 01:59:14.247
SORT OF POLITICAL AND AND PUBLIC

01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:15.982
ACCEPTABILITY REASONS WHY THESE

01:59:16.048 --> 01:59:17.483
MIGHT BE THESE FLEET VEHICLES

01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:20.253
MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY TO TO BEGIN

01:59:20.319 --> 01:59:21.554
IMPLEMENTING A MILEAGE.

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:22.922
NOW YOU YOU --

01:59:22.989 --> 01:59:24.557
JUST SO LAST QUESTION FOR A

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:26.692
JOURNALIST PUBLIC TO TESTIFY --

01:59:26.759 --> 01:59:27.960
YOU YOU --

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:34.066
HAD A LIKE A A PRIMER ON WHAT

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:35.568
KIND OF FACTORS.

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:37.670
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE

01:59:37.737 --> 01:59:38.871
CONSIDERING FUNDING

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:40.406
TRANSPORTATION.

01:59:40.473 --> 01:59:41.340
YOU KNOW LIKE MAINTENANCE

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:42.675
PROJECT IN YOU HAD IF YOU HAD

01:59:42.742 --> 01:59:44.277
LIKE A PRETTY GOOD.

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:46.145
PRIMER.

01:59:46.212 --> 01:59:46.779
I MEMBER LIKE I'M I'M THINKING

01:59:46.846 --> 01:59:49.448
LIKE. THREE FOUR YEARS AGO YOU

01:59:49.515 --> 01:59:51.117
PERCENT OF THIS TO ME YOU HAVE A

01:59:51.183 --> 01:59:52.952
GOT A COMMUNITY MEETING WE HAD

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:56.289
ON YOU WE HAD THE FIRST HEARINGS.

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:57.957
IN THE SENATE BEFORE WE START

01:59:58.024 --> 02:00:01.193
DEVELOPING I THINK THAT FRAME

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:02.662
WE'RE JUST LOOKING AHEAD.

02:00:02.728 --> 02:00:04.030
YOU HEARD THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:00:04.096 --> 02:00:06.933
PEOPLE SAYING THEY THEY FUNDED

02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:09.402
PART OF THEIR THIS DEFICIT BUT

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:10.336
NOT ALL OF IT SO THEY'RE NOW

02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:12.138
KIND OF WONDERING.

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:14.807
HOW DO WE CLOSE THAT GAP AND

02:00:14.874 --> 02:00:15.741
HEARD LIKE THE GENERAL FUND WE

02:00:15.808 --> 02:00:17.343
HEARD ALL THESE DIFFERENT --

02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:19.211
I THINK IT I THINK WOULD BE

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:21.113
HELPFUL IF YOU HAD.

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:23.282
THAT PRIMER APPLY TO LOCAL

02:00:23.349 --> 02:00:25.484
GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THEM.

02:00:25.551 --> 02:00:28.287
CONSIDER WAYS OF FUNDING.

02:00:28.354 --> 02:00:31.457
OF THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG THAT

02:00:31.524 --> 02:00:32.758
THEY STILL HAVE BECAUSE THEY

02:00:32.825 --> 02:00:34.126
OBVIOUSLY STILL.

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:34.827
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET A

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:36.228
REPORTER THINK FROM THE LEAGUE

02:00:36.295 --> 02:00:37.930
OF CITIES AND SEE SACK OF

02:00:37.997 --> 02:00:39.899
BROUGHT THE THE MAINTENANCE

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:41.601
BACKLOG HOW TO THE HELL WHAT

02:00:41.667 --> 02:00:43.436
WOULD BE THE RIGHT WAY TO DEAL

02:00:43.502 --> 02:00:44.437
WITH THAT AND HOWEVER THE

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:45.972
APPROACH THAT ISSUE.

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:46.405
I THINK --

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:48.307
PRIMER LIKE YOU GAVE ME FOUR

02:00:48.374 --> 02:00:50.076
YEARS AGO.

02:00:50.142 --> 02:00:54.313
ON FIGURING OUT WHAT KIND OF

02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:57.416
APPROACHES WE SHOULD TAKE ON THE

02:00:57.483 --> 02:01:00.152
STATE WIDE SP ONE YOU REALLY

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:01.687

CALIFORNIA.

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:18.137
SO -- I

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:18.771
DON'T KNOW IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:19.805

LEVEL GUIDE TO THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:01:28.247 --> 02:01:29.982
BUT I THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:31.250
PRETTY --

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:33.019
