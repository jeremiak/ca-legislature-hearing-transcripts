THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.120
TWENTY TWO AND WE BELIEVE THAT

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:23.088

PRODUCT OF US DO. REACH RAISING

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:52.351

CERTAINLY IN THE LATTER HALF OF

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:12.671
INCREASE IN BOTH FORMAL

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.640

AUG THIRTY FOR. OCTOBER FIRST.

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:33.792
THE THIS IS A- ONE TIME GENERAL

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.661
MONEY IN A REALLY SHORT WINDOW

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:36.795
SO THERE'S NOT REALLY AN

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:38.730
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HIRE VERY

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.332
YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:42.034

HIRE PEOPLE TO WORK ON THIS IN

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:48.540
THAT WINDOW. SO WHILE I- I THINK

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:49.574
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT IS AN

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:51.109
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN THE BEST

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:52.444
USE OF THESE FUNDS AND IT WILL

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:54.579
IT BE SUPER EFFECTIVE. GIVEN THE

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.014

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.350
DEADLINES THAT THE STATE DOESN'T

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.352
CONTROL WE THINK THAT THAT IS

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:01.353
OUR BEST. OPTION FOR

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.921
CALIFORNIA'S BORROWERS RIGHT

WINDOW. WE THINK THAT'S OUR BEST

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:22.507
OUR BEST BET. VERY GOOD THAT'S

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:23.542
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND IT IT

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:24.576
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE A LITTLE

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:26.378
BIT UNUSUAL IN THAT WE DON'T WE

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:27.813

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:29.881

CAREFUL ABOUT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:20.091
MAKE SENSE TO DUPLICATE EFFORTS.

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:21.493

JOURNEY ADVISORS AND CSG

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:53.370
ADVISORS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTE

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:55.205
DREAM TEAM FOR THIS WORK

TO WORK WITH. OKAY SO I KNOW

THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE

00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:07.684
GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION SO THIS

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:08.552
IS THE ONLY SLIDE THAT I WILL

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.887
SPEND TO QUOTE ADMIRING THE

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:12.956
PROBLEM NOW BUT I WANT TO CALL

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:17.961
OUT TWO THINGS IN. PARTICULAR

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:18.695
FIRST. YOU ARE STRUGGLING

00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:20.430
HOUSING. FALL ACROSS THE STATE.

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:21.932
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:23.733
THE STATE HOMEOWNER. ASSISTANCE

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.334
PROGRAM SERVE PEOPLE IN ALL

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:26.369
PARTS OF THE STATE INCLUDING IN

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:28.171
ITS HIGH COST AREAS. THE BAY

00:53:28.238 --> 00:53:29.839
AREA IN PARTICULAR IS SEEN IT'S

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:31.808
MEDIAN HOUSING PRICE RISE THREE

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:33.577
TIMES HIGHER. THAN SOME OTHER

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:35.779
AREAS OF THE STATE SINCE TWENTY

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:38.315
FIFTEEN. SAKIN IT IS DIFFICULT

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:39.916
TO PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP WITHOUT

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:42.018
HOMES FOR PEOPLE TO OWN. SO I

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:43.520
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THE

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:45.855
LEGISLATURE IS DOING TO WORK ON

00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:47.424
INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.125
. THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:50.026
HOMEOWNERSHIP ARE TRULY

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:53.196
STRIKING. AS SUCH WE CANNOT WAIT

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:55.098
UNTIL MORE HOUSING IS BUILT FOR

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.299
THESE COMMUNITIES TO BEGIN TO

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:58.668
BUILD THE GENERATIONAL WEALTH

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.470
THAT THEY WERE LOCKED OUT OF IN

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:03.239
DEEPLY DESERVE. SO IN ADDITION

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:04.908
FOR TO A PROGRAM THAT IS GOING

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:06.242
TO WORK IN ALL PARTS OF THE

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:08.211
STATE WE NEED A PROGRAM THAT IS

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:10.347
GOING TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:11.648
AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE FOR

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:12.616
HOMEOWNERS ESPECIALLY IN THE

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:14.250
STATE'S BLACK AND BROWN

00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:17.354
COMMUNITIES. ALRIGHT SO SINCE

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.055
THIS IS A BRIEF PRESENTATION AND

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.790
NOT A LONG SEMINAR THERE ARE A

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:22.626
VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:24.561
HELP ACHIEVE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND I

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:26.830
DON'T HAVE TIME TO REVIEW THEM

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:28.832
ALL IN DETAIL THIS MORNING. WHAT

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.834
I WANT TO CALL OUT HERE IS THAT

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.504
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:37.273
OTHER AGENCIES AT THE STATE AND

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.508
LOCAL LEVEL. RAFIC AND

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:39.776
THOROUGHLY DESERVING OF YOUR

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:41.478
SUPPORT AND WE WERE DELIGHTED TO

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:43.980
SEE ALLOCATIONS TO THOSE

00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:45.482
PROGRAMS MADE IN THE SENATE'S

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:47.250
BUG BUDGET PACKAGE AND WE

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:48.918
SUPPORT THEM ENTIRELY. THE

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:49.986
PROGRAM I'M GONNA BE TALKING

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:52.355
ABOUT TODAY THE CALIFORNIA DREAM

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:54.324
FOR ALL PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.259
COMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS WITH A

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.161
PARTICULAR APPROACH THAT IS

00:54:58.228 --> 00:55:00.130
SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO THE

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:02.098
HOMEOWNERSHIP CHALLENGES THAT WE

00:55:02.165 --> 00:55:04.034
ARE NOT ADDRESSING TO OUR

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.502
EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND IT IS

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:08.204
DESIGNED TO DO IT ON A SCALE

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:09.472
THEY WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:12.342
IMPACT ON RACIAL AND ECONOMIC

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.244
EQUITY IN THE STATE. THE MAIN

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.379
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THE

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:18.581
OTHER PROGRAMS IS THE DOWN

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:20.684
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE COMES OUT OF

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.986
REPAYING IT COMES OUT OF THE

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:25.288
APPRECIATION OF THE HOME. THIS

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:26.523
IS DIFFERENT FROM A FORGIVABLE

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:29.225
LOAN THAT IS PAID FOR ALMOST

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:31.361
ENTIRELY BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:32.829
AND HENCE DOESN'T RECYCLE MUCH

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:34.264
OF THE MONEY TO HELP NEW

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.267
HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:38.168
THE STATE DOESN'T MAKE MONEY ON

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:40.036
THIS PROGRAM THE MONEY THAT THE

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.538
STATE GETS BACK FROM SHARED

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:44.174
APPRECIATION GETS USED TO HELP

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.809
ADDITIONAL HOMEOWNERS AND THAT'S

00:55:45.875 --> 00:55:47.010
WHY THIS IS A REVOLVING

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:49.612
INVESTMENT FUND. INSTEAD OF A

00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:52.148
ONE TIME PROGRAM. ALSO DIFFERENT

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:53.883
FROM MORE CONVENTIONAL FIXED

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.719
INTEREST SECOND LOANS THAT ARE

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:57.620
PAID FOR BY THE HOMEOWNER.

00:55:57.687 --> 00:56:00.290
REFINANCING OR SALE. TO BE CLEAR

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:01.691
BOTH OF THESE OTHER TYPES OF

00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:03.326
PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:05.495
AND USEFUL BUT THEY DO NOT SOLVE

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:06.796
ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT THE

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:07.964
STATE HAS BEEN PROMOTED

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:11.568
HOMEOWNERSHIP. OKAY SO AS WE SET

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:15.271
OUT TO. WORK ON THIS PROJECT WE

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:17.674
REALLY WANTED TO HAVE A NUMBER

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:20.009
OF KEY GOALS IN MIND SO I'M

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:21.978
GONNA GO OVER THOSE GOALS AND

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:22.512
HOW THIS SPECIFIC PROGRAM

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:24.681
ADDRESS SYSTEM. FIRST WE REALLY

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:26.349
WANT TO PROVIDE A LARGE AMOUNT

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:27.450
OF DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE I

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:29.285
TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR RACIAL

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:31.721
AND ECONOMIC EQUITY. AND WHAT WE

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:33.356
WANT TO DO IS PROVIDE A

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.024
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:37.127
PRIEST SOMEWHAT SMALLER NUMBER

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:39.662
OF BORROWERS WE DON'T WANT TO

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:40.730
HAPPEN SPEND SO MUCH MONEY IN

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.665
THE MARKET THAT WE JUST INFLATE

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.167
THE MARKET GENERALLY. AND DON'T

00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:46.603
ACTUALLY HELP OUT WITH- THE

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:47.971
SPECIFIC POPULATIONS WE WANT TO

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:50.140
REACH WE WANT TO SUPPORT REAL

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:52.208
WEALTH ACCUMULATION TIED TO HELP

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:54.744
BRIDGE THOSE ECONOMIC AND-

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:57.547
EQUITY GAPS. WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:58.448
THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:00.917
ASSISTED OVER TIME THROUGH

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:02.418
RECYCLING THE MONEY. WHICH I

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:04.420
TALKED ABOUT AS A KEY DIFFERENCE

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:06.256
WITH A FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAMS.

00:57:06.322 --> 00:57:08.458
AND THEN WE WANT TO COMPLEMENT

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:09.659
THE EXISTING HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:11.394
PROGRAMS BY SERVING NEW TYPES OF

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:13.630
BORROWERS SO HOW DOES THIS

00:57:13.696 --> 00:57:16.299
PROGRAM DO NOT. IT REDUCES THE

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:18.468
INCOME REQUIRED TO PURCHASE THE

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.970
MEDIAN PRICED HOME BY OVER

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.605
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

00:57:22.672 --> 00:57:23.840
NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS NOW I

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:25.742
WANT TO MAKE THE POINT HERE NOT

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:26.976
ALL HOMEOWNERS AND ESPECIALLY

00:57:27.043 --> 00:57:30.313
NOT ALL. FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.348
FIRST GENERATION HOMEOWNERS ARE

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:33.683
GOING TO BE PURCHASING A MEDIAN

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:36.452
PRICED HOUSE IT'LL BE USING THIS

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:38.755
NUMBER FOR A MEDIAN PRICED HOUSE

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:39.522
BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE MORE

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:41.124
REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT SOME

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:43.126
BUYERS ARE GOING TO BE SEEING.

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:45.061
IN THE HIGHER COST AREAS THAT

00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:46.629
ARE LAST SERVED BY THE STATE'S

00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:49.999
EXISTING PROGRAMS. BUT IT LOWERS

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:53.002
THE DIE- THE INCOME NECESSARY

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:55.305
SUBSTANTIALLY WHICH IS THE GOAL

00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:57.707
OF THE PROGRAM. SECOND THE

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:59.075
CREATES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:01.911
OUR WEALTH OVER FORTY YEARS IT

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:03.980
WILL CREATE OVER A HUNDRED AND

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:05.415
THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:12.188
BORROWER WELL. WHICH IS MORE.

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:15.024
THAN FIVE INDEED EXPECTS INR. I

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:16.326
A NUMBER OF ON INCLUDE US AND

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.361
LIST IN PRO. AND NOW AGAIN I'VE

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:19.762
TALKED ABOUT THE RISK BIN. IT

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:21.164
WAS OVER HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:22.699
FAMILIES OVER THIS PERIOD OF

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:25.602
TIME WHICH IS. AS WELL

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:27.737
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THIS

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:29.239
SIMPLE LIST INTEREST PROGRAM

00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:31.107
BECAUSE OF THE GREATER RECYCLING

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.742
THROUGH THE APPRECIATION. IT

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.644
DOES ALL OF THIS AT A LOWER

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.179
TOTAL COST TO THE STATE AND WITH

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:37.947
GREATER DOWNSIDE PROTECTION FOR

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:40.416
THE BORROWERS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:42.652
OF HOW WE DESIGNED THE PROGRAM.

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:44.554
SO I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE.

00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:46.522
SLIDES TO GO THROUGH AND THEN

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:49.192
HAPPY TO ANSWER YOURQUESTIONS

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:51.227
SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:51.895
STATISTICS THAT I'VE BEEN

00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:53.596
MENTIONING- THIS YEAR

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:55.365
DEPRECIATION PROGRAM WILL

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:57.800
PROVIDE A 17% DOWN PAYMENT

00:58:57.867 --> 00:59:01.037
ASSISTANCE- WE ARE COMFORTABLE

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:03.606
WITH THESE BORROWERS. RECEIVING

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:05.074
OTHER DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:06.643
FROM OTHER PROGRAMS ARE FROM

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:09.946
FAMILIES WE DON'T REQUIRE ANY

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:13.516
DOWN PAYMENT FROM THE BORROWERS

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.184
. A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THIS A-

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.686
HAS INTO THAT DOT COM YEAH IT

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:18.888
ISN'T AS IMPORTANT. FOR THE

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.356
HOMEOWNERS THE WONDERFUL

00:59:20.423 --> 00:59:22.959
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORK DONE

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:25.161
BY CAN THAT. CALIFORNIA

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:26.696
COMMUNITY BUILDERS ARE RUN BY

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:28.798
ADAM REALNESS HASN'T REALLY

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:31.034
SHOWN THAT THE KEY IS MAKING

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.136
SURE THAT WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL

00:59:33.202 --> 00:59:35.305
AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR SUPPORT AND

00:59:35.371 --> 00:59:37.707
COUNSELING PRE AND POST PURCHASE

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:39.375
FOR THOSE BORROWERS THAT IS MUCH

00:59:39.442 --> 00:59:41.311
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE AMOUNT

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:43.780
OF KORAPUT SKIN THAT THEY HAVE

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:46.149
ANY GAME. CAUGHT ONE TRADE OFF

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:47.951
IS. SORT OF ALMOST. YOU KNOW

00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:50.219
COUNTER INTUITIVELY BECAUSE THE

00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:51.888
BORROWERS WILL NOT TAKE ON AS

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.556
MUCH OF THAT IN A SHARED

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:55.858
APPRECIATION PROGRAM GOD THEY

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:58.127
PAY OFF THAT DEBT MORE SLOWLY

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.530
AND IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER

01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:02.966
UNDER THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM.

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:05.301
FOR THEM TO REACH THE 80% LOAN

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.869
TO VALUE ACCESS AND IT DOESN'T

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.671
OR SOME OTHER PROGRAM SO WANT TO

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.473
BE CLEAR IT REALLY TAKES A

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.910
MOSAIC OF SOLUTIONS IN ORDER TO.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.545
ADDRESS ALL THE NEEDS OF THE

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:17.947
HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE OF

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.148
CALIFORNIA THIS IS ONE BIG TILE

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:23.953
IN THE MOSAIC BUT THESE OTHER

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.521
PROGRAMS REMAIN VITAL. SO LET ME

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:27.924
JUST DON KING WITH THAT CALL OF

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:29.425
SCENARIOS BECAUSE I REALLY WANT

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.027
TO HIGHLIGHT THE DOWNSIDE

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:34.897
PROTECTION- THAT EXISTS. IN FIVE

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:37.967
IN THESE PROGRAMS. AND JUST SO

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:40.203
YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:43.339
PURCHASING. WITH A SINGLE FAMILY

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:45.575
HOME- THE HOME BUYERS A SMALL

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:46.743
DOWN PAYMENT THEY CAN GET THAT

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.144
FROM OTHER PROGRAMS THE

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:50.380
CALIFORNIA DREAM PROGRAM PUTS IN

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:54.484
A CHUNK OF THAT TIME AND THEN

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:55.585
TIE ON TOP OF THE FIRST

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.353
MORTGAGE. ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.388
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:00:58.454 --> 01:00:59.956
CALL OUT HOW WE DESIGNED THIS

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.457
PROGRAM. IN THE DOWNSIDE

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:02.658
SCENARIO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.260
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SORT OF

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.028
THING BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER THE

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:06.829
GREAT RECESSION DAY REMEMBER HOW

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:08.731
PEOPLE ENDED UP UNDERWATER THE

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.533
WINNING DESIGN THIS PROGRAM THE

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.935
PROGRAM ITSELF TAKES MORE OF THE

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:16.072
HIT. IN A DEPRECIATION SCENARIO

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:18.408
AND THE HOMEOWNER EVEN UNDER

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.743
DEPRECIATION OVER TIME ENDS UP

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:21.911
BUILDING THEIR EQUITY IN THE

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:24.347
PROGRAM SO THAT IN ALL RIGHT

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:25.982
SCENARIO THAT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:27.717
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR BUT WE

01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:29.685
NEED TO DESIGN FOR IT. THE OTHER

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.487
SCENARIO IS WHAT WE CALL THE

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:32.789
EXPECTED SCENARIO IT ENVISIONS

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.724
ACTUALLY A SLIGHTLY LOWER LEVEL

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.659
OF HOME PRICE APPRECIATION THAN

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:38.227
WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA TO BE

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:40.363
CONSERVATIVE. BUT IN THAT

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.765
SCENARIO OBVIOUSLY- AND THAT

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.067
HOME BUYERS EQUITY GOES UP

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:46.569
SUBSTANTIALLY THE PROGRAM- IT

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:49.205
MAKES MONEY AND- AND THEN THE

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.007
FIRST MORTGAGE GET PAID OFF. AND

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:52.608
I JUST WANT TO SAY AGAIN THE

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:53.543
STATE DOES NOT MAKE MONEY ON

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:55.478
THIS PROGRAM THIS IS THAT MONEY

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.380
IS PLOUGHED BACK INTO THE

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:59.449
PROGRAM TO HELP OTHER HOME

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:03.986
BUYERS WHICH WE THINK IS A

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.455
REALLY CRITICAL FEATURES HERE-

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.423
AND- THAT. PRO TEAM I'M- FOLKS

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.460
IN A JOURNEY ADVISED CSGN. THE

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:11.727
DESIGN SHARED APPRECIATION

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.931
PROGRAMS ACROSS THE NATION AND

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:16.432
INCLUDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:18.401
THIS STATE. AND I JUST WANT TO

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:19.469
DRAW THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:22.738
SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND IN

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:24.407
WHAT WE'RE PRODUCING HERE WE'RE

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.342
NOT LOOKING TO PROVIDE THROUGH

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.044
THIS PROGRAM MADE THE SAME

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.780
STRONG RATE OF RETURN FOR EQUITY

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:33.149
INVESTORS IN THE PRIVATE MARKET

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:34.250
PROGRAMS ARE DOING. THEY ARE

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:36.586
FINE BUT WE PRODUCES

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.020
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE WEALTH FOR

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.922
THE HOMEOWNERS SUBSTANTIALLY

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:42.158
MORE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION THAN

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:42.758
SOME OF THOSE PRIVATE MARKET

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.561
OPTIONS. AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.930
THAT THIS IS A REALLY GOOD

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:49.599
COMPLEMENT TO THE EXISTING

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.534
PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. SO ME

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.336
JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING HOW

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.604
APPRECIATIVE WE ARE OF PRESIDENT

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.572
PRO TEM ATKINS FOR ADVANCING

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:59.175
THIS PROPOSAL TO TREASURE MOCKED

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:00.977
FOR OVERSEEING THE PROJECT. AND

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.979
WE HAVE A TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.414
HERE TO RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE

WORK. I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.539
PART THAT I LIKE THE MOST WELL

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:05.308
THERE'S TWO PIECES ONE IS THAT.

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:07.176
THE TRADITIONAL MODELS ARE A

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:10.646
GRANT. GRANT PROGRAM AND SO IT'S

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:13.716
FINITE ONCE YOU MEET HIM WHEN TO

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:18.621
USE THE GRANT FUNDS FOR DOWN.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.389
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE- IT BEAT A

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:22.758
YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH FINDING

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:23.960
IT IN ORDER FOR THAT PROGRAM TO

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.729
CONTINUE- WE DID THIS IN IN OUR

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.798
CITY FOR- A NUMBER OF YEARS AND

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.800
AT THAT TIME. A TEN THOUSAND

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:33.703
DOLLAR GRANT WOULD GET YOU INTO-

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:35.972
YOUR FIRST HOME- BY THE END OF

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:38.174
THE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE-

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:41.077
PRESSURE FROM SILICON VALLEY- WE

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.713
HAD TO INCREASE THE GRANTS TO

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:44.647
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT ONCE

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.449
YOU. ONCE YOU USED UP YOUR PART

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:49.552
OF MONEY THERE WAS IN THERE IT

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:52.622
WAS GONE. AND AND THE HOMEOWNERS

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.123
BENEFITTED I'M THOSE FAMILIES-

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:55.891
IT WAS IT WAS IT FUNDAMENTALLY

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.760
CHANGE THEIR LIVES BUT BUT

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.228
THERE'S A FINITE NUMBER THATYOU

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.864
CAN HELP IN THAT INSTANCE- THE

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.734
OTHER MODEL IS ONE THAT SAYS-

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.305
THAT. XBT YOU DON'T GET TO KEEP

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:12.408
HOME AND- THAT'S GOT ALL KINDS

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:13.909
OF PROBLEMS THE PRINCIPLE ONE IS

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.678
THAT. IT'S NOT REALLY YOUR HOME

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.079
YOU'RE JUST RENTING IT DURING

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:18.648
THE PERIOD OF TIME YOU'RE LIVING

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.316
IN IT AND SHOULD YOU NEED A

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:22.485
LARGER PAIR YOU CAN'T USE THE

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:23.986
EQUITY IN THE HOME IN ORDER TO

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:24.954
MAKE THAT LARGER PAIR. AND WE

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:25.688
SEEN THAT IMPOSED ON

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.657
FARMWORKERS- ALL OVER THE PLACE

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:30.293
AND IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR-

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:32.862
BUT IT KEEPS THE PROPERTY

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:36.232
AFFORDABLE- IN PERPETUITY WHICH

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:38.834
IS WHAT SOME GROUPS REALLY LIKE-

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:43.806
AND I PERSONALLY THINK IS- IS

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:45.775
DISCRIMINATORY QUITE FRANKLY IF

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:47.476
I'M GONNA PAY A MORTGAGE I WANT

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.645
TO KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:50.746
BENEFIT FROM THE- FROM THE

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:53.049
EQUITY. IN A MINUTE TAKE REAL

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.517
GOOD CARE OF IT SO THAT THAT

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:57.753
EQUITY IS UP AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.189
SO THIS THIS REALLY- PROVIDES AN

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:02.992
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUND TO

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:03.592
CONTINUE TO EXIST AND FOR THE

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.328
HOMEOWNER TO BE ABLE TO SHARE.

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:06.595
TO SHARE AND BENEFIT FROM THE

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:08.597
EQUITY AND I THINK THAT THIS IS

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:09.865
JUST BRILLIANT SO THE QUESTION

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:12.101
THAT I HAVE IN IN TERMS OF A

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:15.204
LONG TERM STRATEGY IS- WERE YOU

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:18.607
ABLE TO CALCULATE- ASSUMING SOME

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:22.178
SOME RISKS. IN THIS KIND OF A OF

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:25.614
A PROGRAM- HOW LONG OR- HOW. HOW

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.817
FAR OUT THAT THE MONEY IS LIKELY

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:30.419
TO. CONTINUE TO BE UTILIZED MAN

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:31.620
I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFICULT

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:33.389
QUESTION BECAUSE YOU GOT TO LOOK

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:34.857
AT THE CRYSTAL BALL AND IT'S

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:35.991
HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.460
HAPPEN IN HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:38.894
BUT- IF I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:42.298
PROJECTIONS ARE PROBABLY. BE ME

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:49.572
AND THEREFORE I WILL HAVE IT

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:50.806
OVER TO MAKE IT. PETER WHO HAS

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:53.175
THE SOME OF THE LONG TERM

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:54.910
PROJECTIONS OF THAT- HI ABILITY

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.912

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:07.256
ALSO IF YOU COULD IN THAT- IF

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.424
YOU COULD. LET US KNOW WHAT THE

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.926
OVERHEAD. IN TERMS OF THE

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.295
MANAGEMENT OF THE OF THE FUND

APPRECIATION WE'VE ALSO DONE AN

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.577
ANALYSIS SINCE SIX SIMPLE

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:29.945
INTEREST BUILDINGS FOCUSED ON

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:31.981
THE SHARED APPRECIATION PROBABLY

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:33.382
GETTING NEED TO READ IT TO US

ARE THE SMALLER ONES ARE YES AND

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:46.662
HIGH UP OKAY. OKAY FINE SO THE

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:47.830
FUNDS WILL MEET FIRSTHAND FOR

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.565
THE QUESTION ABOUT THE COST OF

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:51.634
THE PROGRAM SO. THIS WAS

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.936
DESIGNED AND MODELED IN THE TOWN

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:55.337
OF SPENCER MODELING FROM LAST

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.940
TWO MONTHS. COM FOUR INVESTMENT

01:07:58.007 --> 01:07:59.675
OF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FROM

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.610
THE STATE FOR TEN YEARS THINGS

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:04.513
FIXED AMOUNTS FROM. TO MAKE

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.749
LOANS TO MAKE THE ACTUAL SECOND

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.751
MORTGAGE LOANS THESE SHARED

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:11.020
APPRECIATION MONTHS. WE'VE ALSO

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:15.157
BUDGETED. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.159
DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR MINISTRY OF

01:08:17.226 --> 01:08:19.495
COST. ON BEYOND YOU KNOW YEAR

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.130
AFTER YEAR THE ON YOUR TENT BUT

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:22.631
STILL THE SAME HUNDRED MILLION

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.300
DOLLAR LEVEL TO MAKE CERTAIN

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:26.402
THAT WAS ADEQUATE. FOR THE HOME

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:27.703
PURCHASE COUNSELING AND

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.738
SERVICING AND OTHER COSTS SO

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:33.375
WE'VE BUILT THAT. FALL INTO INTO

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:36.679
THIS. IN THE- THE TOTAL TAXPAYER

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:39.114
FUNDING OVER THESE OVER THE MANY

01:08:39.181 --> 01:08:40.783
YEARS WOULD BE FOURTEEN BILLION

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.550
DOLLARS INCLUDING THE

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:43.752
ADMINISTRATION OUT FORTY YEARS.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.088
WHICH AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.923
TEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS.

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:50.593
COST SO THAT'S WHAT THE

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:52.194
COSTUMES. SO NOW THE QUESTION IS

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.230
WHAT IS THE STATE'S DOING BY

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:57.733
CREATING THIS DEDICATED

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.902
REVOLVING INVESTMENT FUND. ARMS

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:03.739
WITH OUT SO. IN THE BEGINNING

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:06.909
YEARS THE PRO. IT SERVES.

01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:08.677
SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED- BORROWERS

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:10.212
A YEAR A LITTLE UNDER A THOUSAND

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.881
SOCIAL DEPEND ON WHAT PRICES

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:15.184
PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY. BUT THAT'S

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:16.952
OUR ESTIMATE. HIM SO IT'S

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:19.121
STARTING BY SERVING SEVENTY

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:20.456
SEVEN HUNDRED BORROWERS YEAR

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:22.725
OVER TIME IS THE REPAYMENTS COME

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.994
BACK. THIS DEPENDS ON THE

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.429
APPRECIATION RATE. ARMS WERE

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.999
ABLE THEN TO TAKE THE MONEY AND

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:31.133
HELP SUBSEQUENT BUYERS IN ORDER

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.868
THIS FORTY YEAR PERIOD WE'RE

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.770
HELPING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.906
SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES. ARMS SO

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:39.141
IT CONTINUES ON IS A RECYCLING

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:44.647
PROGRAM. AND THE TOTAL PRICE. OF

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:46.081
THE HOME PURCHASED. WITH ARMED

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:48.150
WITH THIS MUCH IN THE STATE'S

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:50.052
MONEY IS THE KEY ARM BECAUSE

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:50.786
OTHERWISE PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.022
ABLE TO BUY THESE HOME TO THIRTY

01:09:53.088 --> 01:09:56.492
EIGHT GOING DOLLARS. WE PROVIDE

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:57.927
FOR SEVEN DOLLARS OF LAW FROM.

01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:59.328
SO STARTING WITH THE SAME

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:00.095
BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE WE'RE

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:03.032
RECYCLING IN APPRECIATION. AND

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:04.600
WE NOW LOOK THIS IS A VERY

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.769
IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH WAS

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:09.204
WHAT IS THE BORROWER SURE OF THE

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:12.174
HOME PLEASE SHE H. BECAUSE AFTER

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:14.243
ALL. THEY ARE PAYING SOMETHING

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.312
TO US IF WE PUT UP 17% OF THE

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:17.846
PURCHASE PRICE THE STATE PUTS

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:19.915
UP. THE STATE GETS 17%

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:22.518
APPRECIATION OF OUR OR GETS 83%

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:25.087
OF THE APPRECIATION. SO WHAT

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:27.456
HAPPENS OVERALL TO THE TOTAL

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:29.358
APPRECIATION ARE WE TAKING SO

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:30.859
MUCH FROM THE BORROWER THEY WERE

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:32.728
LIMITING THE TOTAL HOUSEHOLD

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:35.364
WEALTH IS CREATED. NO WE FOUND

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:37.466
WAS THAT OVER TIME WE'RE

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:39.702
CREATING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:41.170
THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:43.706
HOUSEHOLD WEALTH FOR BORROWERS

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:47.476

IS FOR YOU CORRECT AT THE END OF

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:51.480
THAT FOUR YEAR PERIOD THE STATE

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:54.516
HAS MONEY TO STILL DO IT WHEN

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:55.484
THOSE BORROWERS WHO ARE STILL

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:58.520
OUTSTANDING G. MAKING LOANS ON

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.556
THE STATE GETS BACK THIRTY FIVE

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:01.523
BILLION DOLLARS OVER TIME

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:04.526
THAT'LL HELP FUTURE BORROWERS SO

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:07.329
WE FOUND. THAT THE NET COST FROM

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:08.764
THE STATE FOR INVESTING WITH

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:12.568
BORROWERS IS ROUGHLY CREATING

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:14.637
TWENTY IS ROUGHLY CREAM TWENTY

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:15.638
TIMES THE AMOUNT OF HOUSEHOLD

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:17.873
WEALTH WITH THE STATE ITSELF IS

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.509
INVESTING WITH ITS OWN FUNDS

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.978
SHOWS THE VERY EFFICIENT PROGRAM

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:25.014
FOR HELPING BUILD HOUSEHOLD

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.917
WEALTH FOR LOTS OF BORUSAN.

01:11:28.984 --> 01:11:32.087
STATE IN THE KEY THING. MAYBE

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:33.255
THE MOST THINGS THAT SHE TO

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:35.491
CREATE. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.626
RATE OF BEING IS GONNA BE. IN

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.294
ANY YEAR AS- EVERYBODY SISTAN

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.030
TRUMP LAST YEAR'S WITH PRICES

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:43.666
GOING UP 40% BECAUSE OF

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:48.470
APPRECIATE. IS CAN MATCH THAT.

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:51.040
SO THE- IF PRICES CONTINUE TO

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.141
RISE FROM. THE STATE GETS MORE

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:54.643
MONEY TO HELP SUBSEQUENT BUYERS

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.178
OTHERWISE YOU HAVE A SITUATION

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:57.479
WHERE YOU'RE JUST GETTING BACK

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:59.481
THE MONEY YOU LANCE FOR SOME

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:01.817
SIMPLE INTEREST RATES. IF PRICES

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:03.352
HAVE RISEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.020
MONEY TO HELP THE NEXT FIRE SO

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:07.022

CONTINUE HELPING BUYERS WITHOUT

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.662
A ROADING. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:16.265
YOU CAN HELP. AT THE SAME TIME

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:18.734

OBLIGATION. TO PAY ANYTHING-

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:24.640
OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:28.210
PRINCIPLES SO WHICH INTENDED TO.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.512

DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE TO

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:37.352
SERVE BORROWERS IN A FAIR WAY.

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:39.321

STATE DOES IS- IN IN- IN SOME

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:13.689
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE VERY FEW OF

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.724
THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY ON THE HOME

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.160

IMPRESSIVE. THANK YOU SENATOR

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:31.273
KABIR ALSO I. ALSO THINK THAT

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:37.980
THIS IS. THE RIGHT TRACK- FOR

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:40.382
HOW WE WORK TO ADDRESS

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:41.483
HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE ENTRY INTO

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:45.320
THEM. THE 17% SEEMS TO BE STATIC

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:50.592
YES. I'M IN THE CENTER OF IT

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.795
SEVENTY BURKE 17% DOWN PAYMENT

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:57.366
ASSISTANCE. YES OKAY SO MY SORT

01:13:57.432 --> 01:14:01.603
OF- I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:03.372
PROGRAM IN RELATIONSHIP TO MY

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.107
DISTRICT WHICH IS INCREDIBLY

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:10.379
DIVERSE- AND ALSO IS A DISTRICT

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:12.714
THAT IS BEING CHALLENGED BY

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:14.783
XCELERATED GENTRIFICATION. AND

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:23.425
SO ANY THOUGHTS ON. HOW WE ALLOW

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:26.628
OR ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS ARE

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:32.134
ABLE TO. COMPETE FOR HOMES IN

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:34.069
THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY WANT

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:38.640
TO LIVE- I WOULD NOT WANT IN

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:41.009
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE TO BE

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.512
THAT FOLKS ARE PUSHED INTO

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.681
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:50.219
MEDIAN PRICE- YOU KNOW IS A

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:52.621
NUMBER THAT PEOPLE FEEL

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:56.825
COMFORTABLE. HAVING CERTAIN

01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:59.895
COMMUNITIES PURCHASE RIGHT AND

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.797
SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT FOR

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.599
AYE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YEAH

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.701
ABSOLUTELY LET ME LET ME SAY TWO

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:07.336
THINGS CORRECTLY FIRST- ACTUALLY

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:08.837
WE'RE DESIGNING I CAN'T YOUR

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:09.972
QUESTION CORRECTLY THE SECOND

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.874
TIME WE'RE DESIGNING IT SUCH

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:15.577
THAT YOU CAN. THE PROGRAM WITH A

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:16.845
LARGER PERCENTAGE OF DOWN

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:18.347
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD YOU

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:21.583
CHOOSE- WE RECOMMEND NO MORE

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.185
THAN THIRTY PERCENT- THE NUMBERS

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:25.687
HERE- WE'RE PROPOSING ARE 17%

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:27.322
AND I THINK ANOTHER KEY ISSUE

01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:29.992
HERE IS THAT- YOU KNOW SAY

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.627
LEGISLATORS GOING TO HAVE TO

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:32.794
DECIDE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.763
THEY WANT TO PROVIDE. IN THE

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:36.999
ENABLING LEGISLATION OBVIOUSLY

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:40.269
THE ADMINISTRATING AGENCIES ARE

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:42.671
YOU KNOW GOING TO MAKE. VARIOUS

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.973
DECISIONS IN THAT REGARD. BUT

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.575
PERHAPS I COULD TURN IT OVER

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:48.577
QUICKLY TO IT TO KATE COLLINS TO

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:52.748
TALK A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT. THE

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.616
RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION. AND

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:57.052
THANK YOU. SO I IN RESPONSE THE

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.621
DESCENDING WE'VE DEBATED DEEPLY-

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:00.956
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.824
RESTRICT PEOPLE EITHER TO BEING

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.027
IN THE PLACE. THAT YOU KNOW THEY

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:06.561
DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT TO TELL

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:08.897
PEOPLE WHERE THEY CAN BUY A HOME

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.565
SO THE REASON WE SET THINGS THE

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:12.534
WAY WE HAVE AS WE TRY TO.

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:15.170
ACCOMMODATE FOR A HIGH ENOUGH-

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:16.738
SHARE THAT PEOPLE COME BY IN

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:18.040
THEIR COMMUNITY THEY COULD

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:21.043
CHOOSE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE-

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:22.311
THAT WAS INTENTIONAL WE LOOK

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.046
REALLY CAREFULLY AT THAT.

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.847
THERE'S A HUGE VARIANCE IN BOTH

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:28.750
HOUSEHOLD INCOME AS WELL AS

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.185
MEDIAN HOUSE PRICE ACROSS THE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.321
STATE AND WE WANTED TO SAY EVERY

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:34.122
YOU'LL SEE AS MANY TRADITIONAL

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.557
DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:37.659
WILL OFFER. A NUMBER LIKE A

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.594
LIMIT FOR THE INCOME AND A LIMIT

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.129
FOR THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE AND

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:42.531
HERE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT AS

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.299
A SHARE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:48.136
FOR JUST BACK. WE ALSO WANT TO

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:49.471
NOTE THAT. AS YOU KNOW IT TO

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:50.472
MICHAEL'S POINT AS THE

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:52.708
ADMINISTRATOR THINKS THROUGH HOW

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:55.010
THAT HOW THIS PROGRAM IS

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:55.844
DISTRIBUTED THE FUNDS ARE

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:58.180
DISTRIBUTED. I HAVEN'T WE DO

01:16:58.246 --> 01:16:59.014
BELIEVE THERE WILL BE

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:00.816
RESERVATIONS FOR DIFFERENT

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:03.051
COMMUNITIES AND I THINK THAT THE

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.653
STATE HAS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.188
TO THINK ABOUT. HOW BEST TO

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:07.923
SERVE AND I CAN BE THERE CAN BE

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.624
IT CAN PLACE BASED ELEMENT TO

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.960
THAT THAT WE THINK- WELL WE'LL

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:13.428
TRY TO HELP WITH THAT WITH

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:15.897
JUSTICE YOU BRING UPGRADE. THANK

BIT. PROBABLY BETTER. AS MANY

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.651

HOUSING COUNSELORS. I SEE A VICE

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.061
MORTGAGE ORIGINATORS AND ONE OF

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.695

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:48.557
PERHAPS DON'T THINK THEY CAN

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:49.958
AFFORD HOMEOWNERSHIP THAT

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:51.927
PERHAPS HAVE TRIED. EXISTING

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:53.528
FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROBLEMS-

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:55.497
I PROGRAMS AND ARE ABLE TO

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.232
ACCESS THEM ALSO REALLY ENSURING

01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:58.900
THAT WE MAXIMIZE SUPPORT AND

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.602
RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:01.470
ORGANIZATIONS AND HOUSING

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:03.472
COUNSELORS- WE THINK WILL BE A

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:05.574
GREAT ANTIDOTE. TO BOTH SOME OF

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.175
THE INHERENT COMPLEXITY THAT'S

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.810
PROGRAM AND ALSO ENSURING THAT

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:10.345
THAT FAMILIES REALIZE THEY DON'T

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:11.980
HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:13.782
THEY CAN STAY WHERE THEY WANT TO

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:14.950
WE'VE BUILT AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:15.917
AS WE THINK REASONABLE

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:17.419
IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS PROGRAM. SO

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:18.653
THAT FOLKS CAN STAY WHERE THEY

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.555
ARE OUR GENTRIFIED OUT AREN'T

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:21.723
JUST PLACED OUT AND WE THINK THE

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:23.658
KEY TO THAT IS REALLY RESOURCING

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:24.359
AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITY

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:25.327
ORGANIZATIONS AND HOUSING

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:31.032
COUNSELORS. I SUPPORT THOSE

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:33.235
FAMILIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:34.636
FOR THAT- SO I DO THANK YOU FOR

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:37.272
SHARING BECAUSE I ALSO THINK

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:39.007
THAT EDUCATION IS KEY NOT JUST

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:40.375
ABOUT LETTING FOLKS KNOW THAT

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.877
THIS IS A POTENTIAL PROGRAM THAT

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.645
WILL EXIST BUT ALSO EDUCATING

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:44.546
FOLKS ABOUT THE PRICE

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:47.015
DIFFERENTIALS THAT ARE VERY REAL

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:50.919
ACROSS THE STATE- RELATED TO.

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:54.022
HOW EXPENSIVE HOMES CAN BE IN

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:56.625
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE- AND

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:59.561
SO I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:03.632
SURE THAT- YOU KNOW LIKE THERE

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:05.267
AREN'T PRICE THRESHOLDS BECAUSE

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:07.035
I COULD CONCEIVABLY HERE PEOPLE

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:08.937
SAY WOLVES MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:10.839
HAVE TO PURCHASE A LIKE I DON'T

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:13.208
WANT THIS TO GO TO A HOME THAT

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.075
COSTS ZERO ONE MILLION DOLLARS

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:15.744
WHY DO YOU NEED A ONE MILLION

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.012
DOLLAR HOUSE. WHEN THE REALITY

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:18.947
IS MAYBE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:21.883
THAT ARE STILL WORKING CLASS-

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:24.085
THAT'S JUST HOW MUCH IT COSTS

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:27.022
YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE MARKET-

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.823
OR YOU DON'T WANT A SITUATION

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.725
WHERE YOU KNOW CERTAIN ZIP CODES

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:34.095
ARE EXCLUDED- BECAUSE FOLKS

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.830
SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE TRYING

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:37.766
TO LIVE. IN COMMUNITY A THEY

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:41.102
SHOULD STAY IN COMMUNITY B. AND

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:42.337
I KNOW THIS IS ABOUT FIRST TIME

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.506
HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT THERE COULD

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:48.043
ALSO BE INSTANCES WHERE. THERE

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.445
IS A HOME THAT IS OWNED BY. A

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.080
FAMILY MEMBER THAT THEY WOULD

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:53.915
LIKE TO THEN SELL TO A NOTHER

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.550
FAMILY MEMBER BECAUSE THEY WANT

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:57.452
TO KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY OR SOME

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.054
SORT OF YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.722
YOU KNOW TRANSFER WITH PURCHASES

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:04.059
ETCETERA. AND IF THERE ARE

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:05.527
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THOSE TYPES

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:09.764
OF- PURCHASES TO BE. CONSIDERED

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:12.300
BECAUSE MAYBE A FAMILY IS REALLY

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:13.335
INTERESTED IN KEEPING THAT HOUSE

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:15.403
YOU KNOW. EIGHT IN THEIR NAME

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:16.938
BUT FOLKS ARE TRYING TO

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:19.274
NECESSARILY GIVE THE HOUSE AWAY

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:22.210
SO- DOES THAT DOES THAT MAKE

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:25.046
SENSE THAT UNDERSTANDS- AND WE

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:26.681
ACTUALLY RECOMMEND DESIGNING THE

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:30.085
PROGRAM WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY-

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.053

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:43.698
TREMENDOUS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

THING AND THIS WILL JUST BE MY

01:21:56.778 --> 01:22:00.415
FINAL IS THAT. YOU KNOW. I WOULD

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.784
HATE FOR US TO GET INTO A

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.719
SCENARIO WHERE WE SAY X. NUMBER

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:06.821
OF HOMES YOU KNOW IN NORTHERN

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:08.923

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.498
AGAIN. A LOT OF THIS IS

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:19.200
PREDICATED ON THE MARKET. AND

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:21.369
YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW EQUOL. IS

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:24.306
DIFFERENCE BASED ON JUST WHAT

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:27.842
THINGS COST AND SO YOU IF YOU

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:29.577
DID IT THAT WAY SO THAT EVERYONE

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:31.446
GOT YOU KNOW THE SAME AMOUNTS

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:33.748
RIGHT OF MONEY OF ACCESS. THEN

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:35.016
SOME COMMUNITIES WOULD BE

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.451
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:39.254
BECAUSE LESS WOULD GO TO THEM

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:40.789
JUST BECAUSE THE COST. ARE ARE

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:42.791

THESE DOLLARS. BECAUSE THIS IS A

01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:20.681
NEW ALLOCATION- WE DO ALSO

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:22.550
ANTICIPATE THAT AS ADDITIONAL

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:24.285
RESOURCES FLOW FROM THE FEDERAL

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:25.720
GOVERNMENT THIS ACTIVITY WILL

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:27.722
WILL ALSO NOW BECOME PART OF THE

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:29.524
LARGER DISASTER RECOVERY

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.893
RESPONSE EFFORTS. AND SO WE

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.661
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:35.429
SURE THAT WE'RE THINKING OF

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:38.266
MITIGATION ON SEVERAL LEVELS OF

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:41.102
PLANNING. AND SUSTAINABILITY.

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:43.771
INFRASTRUCTURE MULTI FAMILY

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:45.206
HOUSING AND SINGLE FAMILY

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:47.074

ACTIVITIES VERY SPECIFICALLY. TO

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:51.379
THOSE OTHER EFFORTS AND THEN

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:54.182
AGAIN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:55.449
WE CAN- FIGURE OUT HOW THAT THE

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:56.984
BEST WAY TO LEVERAGE. OTHER

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:59.320
RESOURCES SO THAT WAY WE CAN

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:01.856
MAKE SURE THAT WE MAXIMIZE-

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:04.258
THESE THESE DOLLARS AS THEY

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:05.326
CONTINUE TO FLOW TOWARD

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:07.495
COMMUNITIES. SO IF I UNDERSTAND

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:11.165
YOU CORRECTLY- THIS IS THIS IS-

01:31:11.232 --> 01:31:14.302
MITIGATION FOR PASSED-

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:17.738
DISASTERS. NUMBER ONE. AND

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:21.676
NUMBER TWO I GUESS- THE QUESTION

01:31:21.742 --> 01:31:23.744
I HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE. WELL

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:26.747
ACTUALLY THE QUESTION SHOULD BE-

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:28.816
ARE WE GONNA SEE UP A PLAN OR

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:31.519
OR- A PROPOSAL AT SOME POINT SO

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:33.955
WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE RESOURCES

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:36.057
WOULD GO OUT OR ARE WE JUST

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:38.759
SAYING. DO WHATEVER DO WHATEVER

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:40.761
I GUESS IS THE QUESTION THE

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:43.831
REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE-

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:46.267
THOSE FIRES TOOK OUT. HUGE

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:49.637
SYSTEMS WATER SYSTEMS ROADWAYS-

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:52.139
SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF IT'S IF

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:54.876
IT'S A REPLACEMENT ASSISTANCE

01:31:54.942 --> 01:32:01.983
BUT ALSO- D. THE ABILITY TO DO A

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:05.853
PROACTIVE- I KIND OF HARDENING

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.421
YES BECAUSE I MEAN THE LAST

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:09.123
THING WE WANT IS FOR A ROOF

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:12.093
REPEAT IN THOSE SAME AREAS AND-

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:15.062
SO UGH ARE WE GONNA SEE

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:15.796
SOMETHING DOWN THE ROAD

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.331
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SENATOR IT IS

01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:19.433
NOT SIMPLE REPLACEMENT REALLY IS

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.035
TRYING TO MAKE SURE AS WE BUILD

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:23.037
BACK WE ARE BUILDING BACK. WE

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.906
ARE HARD MEAN WE ARE BEING MORE

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:27.108
RESILIENT WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE-

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:29.343
THE DANGERS THAT EXIST AND SO

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:30.177
THAT WAY COMMUNITIES CAN

01:32:30.244 --> 01:32:33.381
FUNCTION WE DO AS A AS A PART OF

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:35.116
THESE FINES HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:36.550
WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN ACTION

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:38.386
PLANNING PROCESS WHERE WE ENGAGE

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:40.388
WITH COMMUNITIES WE WORK VERY

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:42.924
CLOSELY WITH THEM TO DETERMINE

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:44.959
AGAIN WHAT THESE THESE- BEST

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:46.928
USES OF MEDICATIONS ARE WE HAVE

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:49.363
TO SUBMIT THOSE PLANS BASED ON

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.899
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION TO THE US

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:53.801
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN

HAVE. TAKEN A LOT OF TIME AND

01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:47.194
BASICALLY WOULD HAVE- WRIST A

RETURN OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:51.165
BECAUSE- WE WERE COMPLYING WITH

YOU- IT MENTIONS THAT- THAT SOME

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:10.117
THAT THAT THERE'S A WAIVER OF

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.518
THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:38:11.585 --> 01:38:13.220

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.490
ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES. IS THAT

TWO IS HAVE YOU. WE BROUGHT THIS

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:24.632
ISSUE TO EACH CD BECAUSE- IT'S

01:38:24.698 --> 01:38:28.168
VERY SERIOUS- AND I'M NOT SURE

01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:30.771
THAT THE RESPONSE WE GOT BACK

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.740
WHICH WAS SATISFACTORY. YEAH

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:34.441
WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE I

01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:35.609
BELIEVE IT'S A PROJECT IN

01:38:35.676 --> 01:38:37.911
SALINAS OBERNOLTE HI- THAT

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:38.746
ACTUALLY WASN'T AT HOME KEEP

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:40.047
USUALLY WORKS BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.749
COMBINING THE USE OF FEDERAL

01:38:41.815 --> 01:38:43.484
VOUCHERS WHICH ARE MISTER BY

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:44.785
HOUSING AUTHORITY SO WE DON'T

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:46.820
HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE PIECES-

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:48.188
WE WERE WE ARE ABLE TO

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.490
STREAMLINE THE STATE CONTROLLED

01:38:49.556 --> 01:38:51.292
PIECES SO WHAT. WELL IT WAS NOT-

01:38:51.358 --> 01:38:53.427
IT WOULD LEAD TO A DELAY THERE

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:55.863
IS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH NEPA

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.031
ESSENTIALLY THE FEDERAL

01:38:57.097 --> 01:38:58.465
GOVERNMENT'S VERSION OF SEQUEL

01:38:58.532 --> 01:39:00.901
WE CAN'T OF COURSE- CONTROL OR A

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.770
FACTUALLY CHANGE THERE WE ARE

01:39:02.836 --> 01:39:03.671
TRYING TO WORK WITH OUR-

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:05.739

01:39:05.806 --> 01:39:07.675
YOU CD AFFIRMATION IN THIS

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:09.677
PROGRAM WHICH IS A DIFFERENT

01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:10.611
PROGRAM- DIFFERENT SORTS OF

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.179
FEDERAL FUNDS. THEY LOVE THE

01:39:12.246 --> 01:39:13.314
HOKEY PROGRAM SO WE HAVE

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:14.982
OBVIOUSLY REYES TO THEM SOME OF

01:39:15.049 --> 01:39:16.617
THE CHALLENGES WITH SOME OF

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:18.352
THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHAT

01:39:18.419 --> 01:39:20.688
WE ASK FOR IN TERMS OF- ON THE

01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:23.090
AT LEAST THE SIDE THAT WE

01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:25.125
CONTROL OUR OWN STATE-

01:39:25.192 --> 01:39:27.394
REGULATORY PROCESS. IS

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:29.096
GUIDELINES CREATE A LOT MORE

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:30.097
FLEXIBILITY TO SOMETIMES THE

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:31.432
FEDERAL RULES CHANGE IF THEN WE

01:39:31.498 --> 01:39:33.834
WERE IN TURN YOU HAVE TO GO BACK

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:34.435
THROUGH A NOTHER REGULATORY

01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:36.103
PROCESS ON OUR END WE WOULDN'T

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:38.005
BE WE WOULDN'T BE VERY NIMBLE IN

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:39.673
ORDER TO ADAPT TO THAT CHANGE

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.909
SO. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LAST

01:39:41.975 --> 01:39:43.544
COUPLE YEARS OF ENDEMIC WHEN OUR

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:44.578
DEPARTMENT RECEIVED QUITE A BIT

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.580
OF FUNDS- PULL THROUGH THE ESG

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.649
INCOMPATIBLE APOC GRANT PROGRAMS

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:50.050
HAD WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THOSE

01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:52.419
PROCESSES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:53.821
ABLE TO GET THOSE OUT TO

01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:54.655

CHANGES- GOVERNANCE INSIGHTS

01:39:58.058 --> 01:39:59.693
EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO ALLOW US TO

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.961
BYPASS THIS PROCESS EASIER BUT

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:02.162
NOW THAT WE'VE GOTTEN SOME

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:05.032
MOMENTUM WITH THE FACTS- IN THE

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:06.734
CREATION OF THIS PROGRAM THAT

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.368
ESSENTIALLY COMBINED SOME OF

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:09.970
THOSE USES WE DON'T WANT TO-

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:11.071
TAKE OUR FOOT OFF THE GAS. PEDAL

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:12.906
SO TO SPEAK SO THAT'S WHY THAT

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:15.776
WE SEE THAT REQUEST IT WILL FIX.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:18.379
OUR NEED TO ESSENTIALLY COMPLY

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:19.880
WITH FEDERAL RULES REGULATIONS

01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:21.482

PAY DOWN THE COST OF THE

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:09.763
PROJECT. AND THERE'S ONE PART OF

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:12.533
THE- THE- THE SYSTEM THAT

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:14.101

RECORD SHARE THAT. I THINK IT'S

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:56.276
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:41:56.343 --> 01:41:59.179
MINIMIZE THE COSTS. OF

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:01.348
REPACKAGING FEDERAL PROGRAM SO

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:02.716
THAT WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:05.018
WE'RE GETTING AS MUCH OF THOSE

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:06.920

AND THEN REGIONAL EVERYONE'S

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:12.759
LIKE TAKING A PIECE AND THEN

01:42:12.826 --> 01:42:14.628
THAT LESSENS. THE AMOUNT

01:42:14.695 --> 01:42:16.530
AVAILABLE AT THE END TO ACTUALLY

01:42:16.597 --> 01:42:18.131
DO THE WORK SO. THAT'S NOT

01:42:18.198 --> 01:42:20.267
NECESSARILY IN THE ANALYSIS BUT

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:24.304
I WANTED TO RAISE THAT- IN CASE

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:26.540
YOU HAVE A SENSE OF. THE COSTS

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:27.708
THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:30.677
THAT. OR JUST MAKING SURE THAT

01:42:30.744 --> 01:42:34.281

TAKE US ABOUT FIFTEEN POSITIONS

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:41.955

SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES THE SMALLER

01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:57.004
POPULATION COMMUNITIES THAT

DON'T RECEIVE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS

01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:00.507
FOR CLASS SO. THEIR CAPACITY IS

01:43:00.574 --> 01:43:02.643
LESS SO WE FIND THAT WE DO HAVE
