IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE YOU HERE TO PRESENT. THIS IS. THANKS. BARTALI SEVERE IN FIVE MINUTES THIS IS NUMBER SIXTEEN WHERE YOU GOT. ALFA A LONG WAYS AWAY FOR A LONG WAYS AWAY FROM ME. CENTER VALLEY THERE'S ANY COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO SEE BEFORE WE'RE JUST READY TO THIS THE START ON- ISSUE SIXTEEN THIS IS OUR TRADITIONAL TIME ONE OF THE FIRST HEARING OF THE- TWO YEAR SESSION. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU GUYS WE GOT A LOT OF FUN. NO CHALLENGES WITH FIRE AND- AND FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNED UP LAST YEAR AND SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING SOME MONEY TO. IN THE RIGHT PLACES TO CORRECT THOSE ISSUES OKAY WILL WE HAVE THE PARKS AND RECREATION- UP WE HAVE A BOATING. BOATING PROGRAMS TALK ABOUT RAISING OUR FEES FROM TWENTY DOLLARS TO SEVENTY DOLLARS MOTHER LONG TERM. CHANGES LET'S GO AHEAD. ACCORDING TO GERMAN MURDERS MINES WILL SHOP SMALL ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WITH STATE PARKS. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE FISCAL STABILITY FOR THE HARBORS WATER PRACTICAL AND FUN. AT SIX TO PROVIDE SHORT SERVICE SHORT TERM SUSTAINABILITY THIS FUND WHICH PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR BOATING RELATED PROGRAMS AT THE DIVISION OF BOATING AND WATERWAYS STATE PARK IN ITS- AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO FOR INVASIVE SPECIES AND RELATED EXPENDITURES- ASSOCIATE- THAT THEY COLLECTED BASIS SPECIES PREVENTION. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOUR FLEXIBLE A BALANCED APPROACH THAT REDUCES APPROPRIATIONS SUSPENSE CERTAIN TRANSFERS AND INCREASES THE VESSEL REGISTRATION FEE FROM TWENTY DOLLARS TO SEVENTY DOLLARS ON A BIANNUAL BASIS. THE REGISTRATION STARTED ON EVEN HERE WITH GROUPS FROM TEN TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. SO THE L. L. POINTS OUT THIS IS AN INTERN WITH ROACH INTENDED TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM SHORT TERM SOLVENCY THE FUND WHILE LONGER TERM SUSTAINABLE MEASURES ARE EXPLORED. THE SPECIFICALLY THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONSIDER MOVING TO A TIERED BUSTLE REGISTRATION FEE WILL BE BASED ON BUSTLING. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE EQUITABLE APPROACH FIFTY RAISING. DISCUSSIONS ALSO INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING SOME FEE COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITIES THE NBA TO DB W. REDUCE COST NOT A FLEXIBILITY TO BE STRUCTURING. EXPLORING FEES FOR NON MOTORIZED VESSELS EXPANDING THE QUALITIES HE REFUSED TO MORE BROADLY COVER COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH A. I. S. PROGRAM. BUT AGAIN THE V. PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A FEW REYES FROM TWENTY TO SEVENTY DOLLARS ON A BIANNUAL BASIS. SO A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND BEFORE WE JUMP INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS EXPENDITURES OF RESUME YOU PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN FUNDED AND SOME REVENUES FOR THE HARBORS WATER PROPER BOND FUND HAVE DECLINED. SPECIFICALLY R. S. PROGRAM WHICH TREATS WATER HYACINTH AND DOWNS THAT. EXPENDITURES HAVE GROWN IN THAT PROGRAM FROM SIX AND A HALF MILLION. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO FOUR POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THREE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. BUT IT ACTS INITIATIVE DAVIS DAHLE TRANSFERS AT AT THE COST OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THESE TRANSFERS FUND DEBT REPAYMENT AND PROGRAMS FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT FACILITIES ARE SO SHOULD WITH BOATING RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES- AS WITH ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS DB W. HAS- INCURRED AFFAIRS FAIR AMOUNT OF RISING PLAY COMPENSATION COSTS THE FUND HIGHER WAGES RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND HEALTH CARE COSTS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE WAS A CLARIFICATION TO THE WAY THE SCO TRANSFERS FUEL TAXES. WHICH RESULTED IN A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL REVENUE LOSSES SO SHE WOULD. VOTING FUEL TAXES TO HARVEST WATER PRACTICAL IMPACT. ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR PUBLIC BEACH RESTORATION FUNDRAISERS WERE INITIATED WHICH FUND FUTURE OCEAN AND PHYSICAL BARRIER PROTECTION FOR- ELIGIBLE MUNICIPALITIES. THIS PROPOSAL THE FARMERS MARKET AFTER FALLING FENESTRATION FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL THAT DEFICIT ON. AND WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO CONTINUE A CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS AGAIN WE SEEK A BALANCED APPROACH TO SOLVING THAT DEFICIT BY RAISING TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEES REDUCE APPROPRIATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY FORTY MILLION. AND SEEKING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL THUNDERBIRD TWO YEAR PERIOD. WOULD ALSO SUSPEND SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL PUBLICATION RESTORATION FUNDRAISERS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A PERFECT PRACTICAL MEASURE TO TAKE A SHORT TERM THAT PRIORITIZES KEEPING BUSTLE REGISTRATION FEES LOW MAINTAINING SERVICE LEVELS. AND LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND REQUESTED. SO SPECIFICALLY ON THE REDUCTIONS. WERE PROPOSING FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ELLERY- APPROPRIATION REDUCTION THAT PRIORITIZES OPERATIONS OF THE HIGHEST NEEDS. AND RECOGNIZES THE STORK LEVELS OF EXPENDITURE INTERSTATE OPERATIONS LOCAL SYSTEMS PROGRAMS. AND STATE OPERATIONS WERE LOOKING AT A TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND IT TWO MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN THE BUDGET YEAR FOR STATE OPERATIONS. THE CURRENT YEAR- THAT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION WILL BE BALANCED THE PROPORTIONAL DIVISION BUT IN WATER WATERBODIES PROGRAMS AS WELL. AS OTHER PROGRAMS FUNDED BY HARBOR'S WATERFRONT PEOPLE SPENT THE MAJORITY OF THE CURRENT YEAR REDUCTION WOULD BE BORNE BY. THE QUALICUM BASIS SPECIES PROGRAM. THIS IS IN LINE WITH PERCENT- IN THE REDUCTION AT ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS WILL TAKE BEGINNING THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IN BUDGET YEAR. WE WILL DO A ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION TO AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES PROGRAM. WELL THIS PRODUCTION IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIANS WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE MATERIAL IMPACT OF THIS REDUCTION WILL BE SMALL- THIS REDUCTION RECOGNIZES ORACLE SAVINGS IN THIS PROGRAM AND ALLOWS US TO PRIORITIZE TREATMENT AREAS WITHIN THE DELTA- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER. RESOURCES TO CONTINUE- TREATMENT LEVELS ACROSS THE DELTA. THE MOBILE SYSTEMS WERE LOOKING AT A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION. TO THREE PROGRAMS WITH THEM- THE DIVISION OF BOATING AND WATERWAYS. FIVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARINA PROGRAM. THE REASON WE LOOKED AT THIS PROGRAM AS IT'S BEEN UNDER PRESCRIBE FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE AN APPROPRIATION OF ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. YEAH IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE- DONE VERY MINIMAL ON THE LOAN WENT INSIDE- WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE HOW MUCH DEMAND FOR THIS PROGRAM EXISTS GOING FORWARD. I WOULD BE REALIZE THAT IT'S A VIBRANT SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR THE FUND- CONSIDERING WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU KNOW INTEREST RATE REPAYMENT AS ALL AND ALSO THE PRINCIPAL REPAID TO THE FACT- WE'RE LOOKING AT A FIVE. POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION TO OUR BOAT LAUNCH FACILITY GRANTS PROGRAM- THESE GRANTS MADE TO QUALIFYING PUBLICATIONS USED TO FIND FACILITIES SUCH AS BUT ONE TRANSPORTING FLOATS. UP PARKING AREAS RESTROOMS. AND LYFT FOR MOTORIZED AND NON MOTORIZED BOATS. IN THIS PRODUCTION REPRESENTS THE TRUE AVERAGE SPEND OF THIS PROGRAM OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE THINK WE CAN REDUCE THIS PROGRAM AND NOT SEE MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF GRANTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY PROVIDING FOR THIS PROGRAM- AND THEN FINALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REDUCTION TO. THE QUALITY ZERO MUSSEL INFESTATION GRANT PROGRAMS. WHICH PROVIDE SUPPORT WHICH PROVIDES PREVENTATIVE PLANS AND SUPPORT. FOR A CALIFORNIA'S RESERVOIRS AGAINST MUSSEL INFESTATION- AGAIN THIS THIS IS A TRUE UP WITH OUR- HISTORICAL CENTER LEVEL SO WE'RE REDUCING APPROPRIATIONS TO MATCH. ALL KNOW THAT THIS THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT IMPACT THE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATIONS AND OTHER MARINE PATROL PROGRAMS- WE'RE LOOKING AT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CAP THIS PROGRAM AT THE CURRENT AMOUNT. STEP TWO CURRENTLY REQUIRES THAT HALF OF THE REVENUE RECEIVED BY HER IS MORE PRACTICAL THAN BE SPENT ON THE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. SO ABSENT THE CHANGED THEIR ANY FEAR RACISM ROAD BY ADDITIONAL AMOUNT THAT HAS TO GO OUT FINANCIALLY PROGRAM. CONTINUING ON THE REDUCTION SIDE OF THE LEDGER- WE'RE LOOKING AT A SUSPENSION OF PUBLIC BEACH RESTORATION FUND FOR ANSWERS. THESE TRANSFERS WERE INITIATED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND FUN BEACH REPLENISHMENT GRAPHS AS WELL AS PHYSICAL BARRIERS SUCH AS SEAWALLS. ON AVERAGE WE TRANSFER ABOUT FORTY SEVEN MILLION TO THE BOAT BEACH RESTORATION FINANCIALLY. WE ARE PROPOSING SUSPENDING THIS TRANSFERENCE ON ALTERNATIVE FUNDS WHICH CAN BE A THAT IDENTIFIED. WELL WE THINK THERE'S A BIG SENSE IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE PERSON WATER PROPERTY BOND FUND IN OUR VIEW IT DOES NOT CONVERT DIRECT BENEFIT UPON VOTERS SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE PROPOSE FOR. A RETENTION. AND THEN FINALLY THE FEE INCREASE. WE'RE LOOKING AT- A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR PER YEAR OR FIFTY DOLLAR BI ANNUAL RENEWAL INCREASE FOR VESSEL REGISTRATION. THE CURRENT FEE ON A BIANNUAL BASIS IS TWENTY DOLLARS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE IT SEVENTY DOLLARS. ALL NOTE THAT THE LAST INCREASE WE HAVE FOR OUR VESSEL REGISTRATION FEE WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE ONLY INCREASED FROM TEN TO TWENTY ON A BIANNUAL BASIS. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S VESSEL REGISTRATION FEE IS THE LOWEST IN THE NATION. WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE WOULD BE SIX LOS IN THE NATION SO IT'S STILL AN EXTREMELY- AFFORDABLE FEE- THE DM B. IN ORDER TO DISAPPEAR THERE'S A THREE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLAR COST TO THE DMV FOR SYSTEM UPGRADES. WE EXPECT TO HAVE- THE SYSTEM UPGRADES IN PLACE TO BE RENEWALS BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WITH THAT I WILL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS. BEFORE WE HEAR TO. HEAR FROM THE L. A. O. WHO- GENERALLY AGREES WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S OF PACKAGE THEY DO DISAGREE ON THE BEACH RESTORATION PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE NEXUS THEY THINK THAT. BEACH GOERS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND HOMEOWNERS WOULD BE A BETTER SOURCE TO PAY FOR THAT THAT SOURCE OF THAT FEE RATHER THAN THE BOATERS AND- YOUR DEPARTMENT. SEEMS TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND PARKS WISE THAT. WE ACTUALLY DID AN ANALYSIS A FEW YEARS AGO FOR A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT THAT WAS PROVIDED TO ALEJO. WE DID FIND THAT THERE WAS A NEXUS ALBEIT NOT OF SUPER STRONG NEXUS BUT- THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN MARINA BOTH ACTIVITIES AND BE A GENERATION OF FANS IN THOSE ARENAS- MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT COME BACK EVERY PLACE TO STAND SO. THERE IS AN ENTIRE BECAUSE BY VOTERS- IN MARINAS OUT THE THIS PROGRAM SEEKS TO. MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS AND THEN REPLENISH THE SPEECHES SO THAT'S THAT'S THE NEXUS THAT WE DRAW THERE'S MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WHICH WE CAN. CERTAINLY SURE THAT MANY. MICEX WHAT YOU'RE WHAT THE- GOOD MORNING. EARLY MORNING MEMBERS NICE TO SEE YOU OUT- YES RETAILERS WITH THE L. A. O. SO OVERALL WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH HAS A LOT ABOUT IT THAT'S REASONABLE IT ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS YEAR AND LESS YOU WANT TO HAVE MAJOR PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS IT'S BALANCED IT HAS RAM REVENUE INCREASES AND EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS WE THINK RAISING FEES IS REASONABLE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN RAISED IN SO LONG AND THE EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS ARE PRETTY WELL TARGETED TO REALLY MINIMIZE PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS. I THINK THE MAIN ISSUE IS THAT IT'S NOT PERMANENT IT RELIES ON SHORT TERM GENERAL FUND AND- THEN THEY WILL. HAVE TO COME BACK BEFORE YOU IN A FEW YEARS LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL CHANGES PROBABLY INVOLVING ADDITIONAL FEE INCREASES SO THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVISIT FEES AGAIN IN JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS SO I THINK ONE OF OUR SUGGESTIONS TO YOU IS TO CONSIDER WHETHER YOU MIGHT WANT TO PURSUE A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION THIS YEAR SO OBVIOUSLY THE MOST PERMANENT SOLUTION WOULD BE TO REALLY ADOPT. A PACKAGE OF- GOING PERMANENT EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS AND FEE INCREASES THAT- WOULD BE SUSTAINABLE BUT IT IS COMPLICATED- AS MR SHOPS MEANT NOTED AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT RESTRUCTURING THE FEES AND WHO'S PAYING IF NON MOTORIZED BOTH PAIRS ME- BEGIN TO BE CHARGED AS WELL SO TO THE DEGREE THAT THAT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP THAT KIND OF SOPHISTICATED PACKAGE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ANOTHER OPTION YOU COULD CONSIDER IS ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT ALSO ADOPTING A PACKAGE OF TRIGGER- INCREASES AND POTENTIALLY EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS AS WELL. THAT WOULD TAKE A FACT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHEN THE IN MINISTRATION IS M. ESTIMATING THAT THE THEIR THEIR SOLUTION WOULD KIND OF RUN OUT AND THEN FIND WOULD EXPERIENCE A SHORTFALL AGAIN AND NOW WE TO HAVE KIND OF A BACKSTOP YOU WOULD KNOW THAT YOU HAD A PERMANENT SOLUTION IN PLACE. BUT IT WOULD ALSO GIVE SOME IN TIME FOR THE ADMIN. OF STATE CALLED TO WORK OVER THE COUPLE OF YEARS DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE PERMANENT SOLUTION- THAT MAYBE THEY COULD BRING BEFORE YOU AND- MADE MAYBE MORE SATISFACTORY TO ALL PARTIES AND THEN YOU COULD ADOPT THAT BUT AT LEAST YOU WOULD HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE. THAT YOU HAD A PERMANENT SOLUTION IN PLACE TO THE DEGREE- THAT THAT THAT OTHER TYPE OF SOLUTION WOULDN'T DEVELOP AND YOU WOULDN'T BE KIND OF BACK IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE YOU ARE NOW IN A FEW YEARS. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE OBSERVATION THAT. ALL BOATS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE IT WITH A CAR YEAH I GOT A BEAUTIFUL TWO THOUSAND THREE CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY. I DON'T PAY A FEE THAT A BRAND NEW TESLA WOULD PAY WHAT WHAT WHAT IS WRONG IN THE WORLD THE VOTING OF HAVING SOME SORT OF. ATTENTION TO THE VALUE OF THE OF THE BOAT. WHEN YOU WERE IF WE'RE GOING TO. GIVE DMB THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO CHANGE YOUR SYSTEM WHY WOULD WE NOT. REALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEM GET SOME MONEY OUT OF THAT. YEAH I AM SURE THE DEPARTMENT'S GOT MORE INFORMATION ON ON THIS IS A BET I THINK ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES AS MISTER CHAPMAN NOTED THAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING I THINK IS LOOKING AT THAT LENGTH OF THE BOAT. AS KIND OF A PROXY FOR THE VALUE- SO I THINK I THINK YOU DO HAVE OPTIONS TO LOOK AT MADAME MORE TIERED STRUCTURE BUT I'LL DEFER TO MISTER LAST MONTH. RIGHT SO WE ARE LOOKING AT A VESSEL. BEARD BASED- REGISTRATION SYSTEM. UNFORTUNATELY GETTING THE SYSTEM. OF THAT TYPE IN PLACE- ON THE SAME TIMELINE THAT THIS FUND IS GOING TO NEED ADDITIONAL REVENUES IT IS NOT FEASIBLE AT THIS TIME BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT. I'M LOOKING AT. PARKING TO DMB ABOUT THE SYSTEM CHANGES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR TìM BE USED SYSTEM IS- IN THE PROCESS OF BEING UPGRADED AND- AND RECONFIGURED SO WE'D LIKE TO FIT IN WITH THOSE TIME LINES ON. ON TV SYSTEM RE CONFIGURATIONS AND THEN HOPEFULLY SHOULD- FOR A FUTURE CHANGE THAT SYSTEM THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE- VESSELS OF A DIFFERENT WAY. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF STATE CINNAMON. MINNESOTA THEY BOAST THAT THEY HAVE TEN THOUSAND LAKES AND THEN YOU GOT. MASSACHUSETTS STEVE GODDARD S. AND RHODE ISLAND THEY HAVE BIG BUILDING- COMMUNITIES THERE MUST BE SOMETHING. OFF THE SHELF THAT WERE PEOPLE HAVE. HAVE LOOKED AT THIS. WE HAVE. QUESTIONS SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCH- YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE TIME CONSTRAINTS OF THE VERY QUICK- ON THE QUESTIONS- DO YOU WANT TO SAY THINK YOU. TO- MISFIT THAT WILL FOR HIS PRESENTATION HERE TODAY A COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE ON THE BOAT FEE INCREASES 2210050% INCREASE. IN FIRST IN MANY YEARS ONE I WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON INDEXING SO WE'RE NOT HERE HAVING TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE SUCH A LARGE POTENTIAL INCREASE. SECOND PIECES WHERE THE CHAIR WAS GOING NOW THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN BE LOOKING AT LONGER TRM BUT AT LOOKING AT WHAT THE CHAIR SAID IN A VERY JEALOUS IS TWO THOUSAND THREE CHRYSLER- BUT- BY TAKING A LOOK AT- VLF MODEL SO. THOSE WHO ARE RECREATIONAL BOATERS OUT FISHING IN A SMALL BOAT AREN'T PAYING NEARLY AS MUCH AS THOSE- SO. IF YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT BOTH THE 22% INCREASE POTENTIAL INDEXING. AND HOW FAR AWAY DO YOU THINK YOU REALLY ARE. RELATED TO IMPLEMENTING SOME TYPE OF. VLF MODEL FOR VOTE- SO ALTERED THE INDEXING PERSON I THINK THAT'S- A LAUDABLE APPROACH TO SOLVING THE ISSUE BUT I THINK. IT DOES LIMIT US IN THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS WE COULD COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH. IF GIVEN SOME TIME TO ENGAGE OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND REALLY GET THEIR FEEDBACK. ON WHAT SYSTEM WORKS BEST FOR THAT SO. IF WE END ACCESS MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ANOTHER INCREASE TO THE VESSEL REGISTRATION B. AS IS- IF WE CAN COME BACK WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS NOT. THE BEST APPROACH FOR A FEW REYES. IT WOULD GIVE US SOME TIME TO GET TO WORK WITH THE BOATING COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS. ON A VESSEL TIERED REGISTRATION SYSTEM WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM. WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR NON MOTORIZED BOATERS WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR CARDIGAN BASIS SPECIES COSTS. WE CAN HAVE THAT COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION AND THEN I THINK COME BACK WITH A MORE EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR THE LONG TERM- HOWEVER YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE'S A BENEFIT TO INDUCTION AS WELL I'M HAVING AN AUTOMATIC TRIGGER INSTEAD SHE TO DO THAT. BUT IT DOES ALLEVIATE A LOT OF THIS THE STRESS OF. HAVING TO POSE ADDITIONAL FEES- ON THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT- YOU KNOW. WHEN WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS THAT IS. IT'S A HIGH NUMBER WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I. THINK I MENTIONED WHAT I- WHAT I NOTED IN MY EARLIER TESTIMONY IS THAT. EARLY CALIFORNIA'S LOS NATION AT TEN DOLLARS. WE'RE GOING TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THAT'S GONNA BE THE SIX LOS IN THE NATION SO. THIRDLY WE OFFER A LOT OF PROGRAMS OR DIVISION OF LIVING WATER WAYS- AND THAT FEE IS STILL. EXTREMELY LOW- SO WE'VE GOT SOME GENERAL FUND IN THIS PACKAGE TO ALLEVIATE THE AMOUNT OF THE FEE INCREASE WE'RE LOOKING AT REDUCTIONS WERE BOUNCING. PRIORITY FOR US IS TO KEEP THAT BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE- HOWEVER. WITH ANY TIME YOU SAW IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCY IN A FUNDS YOU'VE YOU'VE ONLY GOT A LIMITED NUMBER ABOUT COMES WITH WITH THE MATH TO GET THERE SO- AND THEN IF YOU CAN I THINK THERE WAS A THIRD QUESTION BUT I'M- BUT I'M NOT RECALLING WHAT. WITHOUT WHAT'S I'M GOOD I KNOW THAT WERE LIMITED IN TIME BUT I APPRECIATE THAT MY LAST PIECE IS TWENTY SECONDS IS. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO BE A CHECK ON THE BOATING COMMUNITY AND ANYTIME WE SEE THESE LARGE- INCREASES AT THE CONSISTENCY IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH. WHEN IT COMES THE FEES BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE MISTRETTA IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. A CENTER TOLLEY. SO BUT. SO- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I GUESS HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE BOATS ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING THE EROSION AND WE'RE NOT JUST HAVING OTHER TYPES OF THE RELIGION THAT NOW WE'RE GONNA SETTLE. A BOAT OWNERS WITH. SO ON THE POLE BEACH RESTORATION FUND TRANSFERS. THIS PROPOSAL RECOMMENDS SUSPENDING MOST TRANSFERS- I THINK FOR SOME REASON HAS THAT BEEN POINTED OUT TO DATE WHICH IS. THAT NEXUS BETWEEN BEACH EROSION. AND BOATERS IS NOT AS STRONG WERE RELEVANT TO THE PROGRAMS THAT VOTERS WANT AS PUTTING THE NEW BOTH THE LAUNCH FACILITY- AT A RESERVOIR SO. WE'VE DONE THIS PROPOSAL WE REALLY LOOKED AT WATER WHAT ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE DELIVER THROUGH TV W. TO HELP THE STRONGEST CORRELATION WITH VOTERS IF WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE FEE. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE PROGRAMS BALLISTICALLY. AND RAISING FEES FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT THAT VOTERS REALLY BENEFIT FROM SO. WALL THERE'S A- THE NEXUS TO THE TO. GREENERY AND VOTING- I BELIEVE NOT VOTE RATE PLAN WITH INITIATED TO THE FOUR. IT WAS. ABOUT FINDING A PROGRAM WITHOUT NECESSARILY A FUNDING SOURCE PERSONAL WATERCRAFT WAS A FIND THAT COULD DO. BUT THOSE REVENUE TRANSFERS AND WAS DEEMED APPROPRIATE- BUT BUT IN THIS PROPOSAL WE DO ACTUALLY RECOMMEND SUSPENDING. THE TRANSFER STOOD UP FOR THOSE REASONS. OKAY WE'LL TAKE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE MATTER OPEN AND WE'RE GONNA COME BACK THE OTHER THING THAT THE STAFF WOULD LIKE IS ON THE INVASIVE SPECIES- PROGRAMS AND ALL THAT IF WE CAN GET SOME INFORMATION ON. THE CONTRIBUTION TO COMMERCIAL. LICENSE VOTERS MAKE THEM AND WE GET THIS IDEA THAT THAT FOREIGN BOATS ARE COMING IN- THEY'RE TALKING AND THEY'RE BRINGING AN INVASIVE SPECIES WHAT ARE THE FEES THAT THEY PAY SO THIS THE COMMITTEE HAS A BETTER. IDEA OF A- HOW TO. DIVIDE THAT UP. AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THE MATTER THIS IS SIXTEEN LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTEEN THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY. AND FIRE PROTECTION WILL BE EMPHASIZING THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY TODAY THESE ARE CAPITAL OUTLAY- AND- LET'S HEAR FROM. DIRECTOR PORTER GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING HER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF YOU- TODAY AGAIN MY NAME IS TOM PORTER I'M THE STATE FORESTER FOR. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- THE DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF. FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AND I JUST WANTED TO OPEN UP VERY QUICKLY KNOWING THAT THEY'RE SHORT ON TIME WE'RE SHORT ON TIME WITH JUST KIND OF THAT- OVERVIEW TWENTY TWENTY IT WAS A FIRE YEAR- LIKE NO OTHER FOR US AND WE TRULY HAVE BEEN SEEING AN INCREASE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. TIME AFTER TIME OF MORE AND MORE OF THESE TYPES OF A LARGE AND DAMAGING- SEASONS AND YEARS FOUR HUNDRED OR FOUR MILLION TWO HUNDRED FOUR MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES PLUS A BURNED. NINETY THREE HUNDRED STRUCTURES DESTROYED. AND THIRTY TWO INDIVIDUALS LOST THEIR LIVES. THREE OF THOSE- WERE A VERY MERGING SEA RESPONDENTS AND SIX OF THE TWENTY LARGEST FIRES IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WE'RE ALL BURNING- AT THE SAME TIME. WELL LAST SEASON DURING THE SIEGE THE AUGUST COMPLEX BEING A MILLION ACRES IN AND OF ITSELF. A AND COVERING- PARTS OF SIX DIFFERENT COUNTIES AT THE SAME TIME. AMAZING YEAR- AND AT TIMES WE HAD UPWARDS OF NINETEEN THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS ARE ON THE LINE OR ASSIGNS TO FIRES AT ALL AT ONCE. THIS IS TAKING A MAJOR TOLL ON OUR RESOURCES OF THE FIREFIGHTERS FOR SURE- BUT ALSO THE LANDS THAT WE PROTECT AND THE- THE FACILITIES AND OTHER OF FIREFIGHTING APPARATUS THAT WE USED TO FIGHT THESE FIRES. WELL FIRE IS A NATURAL PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WE NEED TO SEE MORE PRESCRIBED FIRE ON THE GROUND OF THESE FIRES ARE BEING MULTIPLIED EXPONENTIALLY BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE- EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WERE HAVING WHETHER IT'S HEAT DOMES AND DROUGHTS. OR ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS OF THINGS ARE NOT LIKE THEY WERE DECADES AGO AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR INVESTMENT AND MOVING FORWARD. AS THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH OF PROPOSING TO DO SO- JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE BUILDING ON- IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET- IT IS OF GOING TO FACILITATE MOVING FORWARD WITH A SOME OF THE BIGGER INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE FORM OF- BLACKHAWK STYLE A HELICOPTER REPLACEMENT OF OUR OUR- TRIED AND TRUE IF YOU EASE- WE HAVE TO THAT WORKS IN THE- FIRES LAST YEAR- AND WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS GETTING THE REST OF THOSE SHIPS- IN PLACE THIS YEAR AND MAX REPORTER I GOT IT. EVIDENTLY WE'RE NOT GETTING YOU ON THE SCREEN CAN YOU CLICK ON THE VIDEO ABSOLUTELY HIGHER WELL THERE ARE THERE I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT OKAY THAT'S EMIGRATE AND I ALSO FORGOT TO NOTE ON PAGE TWENTY ONE OF OUR STAFF REPORT WE TALK OF BOTH PAYS YOU GO IN BONDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN TIME COMES TO FUND THE PROJECTS NOT TO REJECT THAT'S A TYPO JUST SO NOBODY THINKS OF HER WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENTLY BUT GO AHEAD. THAT'S OUR STAFF REPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU AT THE END MUCH APOLOGIES BOARD FOR- MISSING THE CAMERA THERE- SO JUST JUST A FINISHING UP WITH THIS- SEE ONE THIRTIES ARE COMING BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF YEARS TO DEPLOY THEM- WE DID AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THE THIRTEEN NEW YEAR ROUND ENGINES LAST YEAR WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE IN PLACE- AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO BALANCE THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR. TODAY AND THE FUTURE WITH THIS- THE FIRST PIECE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR TODAY IS- RELATED TO CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AND ON AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO PASS THE- MY AGE TO AGE DEPUTY DIRECTOR TONY FABBRO. AND HE WILL COVER THOSE MORE SPACE THE- AND WILL OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. YEAH DEPUTY FOR YOU'VE ALL HEARD FROM THE L. REPORT OF SOME HAVE BEING GIVEN THE CAN. SOME IDEA OF PRIORITIES AND HOW THIS MOSAIC GOES TOGETHER WE'VE GOT SOME NEW PROJECTS WE GET SMALL PROJECTS BUT THE STORE THE QUICK WITH. THE DECISIONS THAT YOU GUYS MAY TRY TO GIVE US A LITTLE- IDEA OF WHY WE'RE CHOOSING THE REASON WHY THEY'RE GETTING A PRIORITY AND I WILL NOTE THAT CENTER STERN IS WITH US CENTER STERN. FIFTY DO YOU HAVE STAFF WITH YOU THAT YOU CAN IF YOU DO CAN YOU HAVE THEM IDENTIFY THEM OR CAN YOU IDENTIFY THEM FOR US. IT'S JUST ME. OKAY EXCELLENT THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD DEPUTY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- YEAH TWENTY FAVORITE W. DIRECTOR OF MANAGEMENT SERVICES. THE PROPOSAL TODAY THAT'S BEFORE YOU ENCOMPASSES TWENTY. CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY FIFTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- CALPERS INVENTORY OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FACILITIES INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR FIRE STATIONS TWELVE AIR ATTACK USES. TEN HELLO TAX BASES THIRTY NINE CONSERVATION CAMPS. THREE'S CONSERVATION'S CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS- FIRE CENTERS HUNDRED AND TWELVE COMMUNICATION FACILITIES SIXTEEN ADMINISTRATIVE HEADQUARTERS TWENTY ONE UNIT HEADQUARTERS EIGHT STATE FORESTS A NURSERY TO TRAINING CENTERS IN OVER A HUNDRED OTHER MISCELLANEOUS DISABILITIES THAT SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT- OF THESE FACILITIES 63% APPROXIMATELY 63% WERE CONSTRUCTED PRIOR TO NINETEEN SIXTY. WITH 80% CONSTRUCTED PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY IN THE AVERAGE AGE OF CALIFORNIA FACILITIES EXCEEDS FORTY EIGHT YEARS. THE PROJECT BEFORE YOU TODAY CONSIST OF A NUMBER OF FACILITY RELOCATIONS. PLACEMENTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS TO FIRE STATIONS CONSERVATION CAMP TELETECH BASES AIR ATTACK BASES IN UNIT HEADQUARTERS- THESE PROJECTS REFLECT THE TOP PRIORITIES OF THE OF CALPERS FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO BUILD A SOLID FINANCIAL PLAN TO ENSURE THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THESE PROJECTS THROUGH TO COMPLETION- IT REATIVE TO PRIORITIES PRIORITIZATION. OF THE DEPARTMENT. WE WORK WITH- MIGHT MY PROGRAMS WORK WITH THE- REGIONS WHERE THESE FACILITIES ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED. TO IDENTIFY WHAT WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE IN AS WE BUILD THE FIVE YEAR PLAN AND THAT'S A PLAN THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND UPDATING AS WE NEED TO AS WE NEED TO- BUT WORKING THROUGH- THAT THE BACKLOG OF PROJECTS THAT WE THAT WE HAVE. WE ESSENTIALLY USE FOR- CATEGORIES WERE PRIORITIZING PROJECTS- THE FIRST CATEGORY IS. CONTINUATION OF PROJECTS RELATED TO HIGHLY STRATEGIC EMERGENCY SERVICES INCLUDING- THE CONTINUATION OR COMPLETION OF PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED PROJECTS SUCH AS AIR TECH BASIS TELETECH BASES AN EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTERS. CATEGORY TWO FOCUSES ON LEASE TERMINATION WHERE PROJECTS I AM IN THAT CATEGORY INCLUDE ACQUISITION A RELOCATION OF EXISTING EMERGENCY RESPONSE FACILITIES WITH A HIGH RISK OF LEASE TERMINATION OR LOSS OF SERVICE TO THE STATE. OUR THIRD CATEGORY FOCUSES ON EMERGENCY SERVICES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE FACILITIES- IN THIS CATEGORY PROJECTS INCLUDE HIGHLY STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS NEW AIR ATTACK BASES TELETECH BASES OR EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTER PROJECTS. OR THE CONTINUATION- INDOOR COMPLETION OF PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED FIRE STATION PROJECTS IN AND AS WELL AS NEW FIRE STATION PROJECTS. AND THEN OUR FOURTH CATEGORY FOCUSES ON OPERATIONAL READINESS SO THE PROJECTS IN THIS CATEGORY INCLUDE ADMINISTRATIVE AND TRAINING FACILITIES. AUTOMOTIVE SHOPS AND OTHER- OTHER ACQUISITIONS ARE PROJECTS OF THAT NATURE SO- WE ARE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON ON TRYING TO- INSURE THAT OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE FACILITIES ARE. ABLE TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE SETTING FOR OUR OUR STAFF TO RESPOND AND WORKING EFFICIENTLY AND THAT AND THAT WAY SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ON OUR PRIORITY PRIORITIES- I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ON SPECIFIC PROJECTS AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. DELEO FROM. THE MISTER BROWN. YOUR COMMENTS YES GOOD MORNING MEDICARE MEMBERS BRIAN BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO YES WE AS ANY NOTED MISTER CHAIR WE DID RECOMMEND THAT YOU ENGAGE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS- OUR CONCERN IS NOT SO MUCH WITH ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS AND IN FACT WE THOUGHT THEY ALL EACH ONE OF THE SPECIFIC CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS ARE ONES THAT ARE REASONABLE GIVEN THE AGE OF THE FACILITIES MOST OF THEM ARE SIXTY OR MORE YEARS OLD- AND HAVE OTHER OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES- DIDN'T THE REASON FOR OUR- CON IT WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF THE- LONGER TERM COST- THE- THE OUT YOUR COST OF THESE PROJECTS WHILE THE- PROPOSAL- INCLUDED TOTAL FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT'S MOSTLY FOR PLANNING AN ACQUISITION AND OF COURSE- THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF EACH OF THESE PROJECTS IS THE MORE EXPENSIVE COMPONENT AND THOSE WILL BE IN OUT YEARS AND CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT TOTAL. COSTS FOR THESE PROJECTS IS GONNA BE OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MILLION. ON AT LEAST ON CURRENT ESTIMATES AND- NORMALLY WE WOULD THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO AND WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. MAINTAIN AND REPLACE OLDER FACILITIES BUT THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU FACE IS BOTH OUR OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT FINANCES ARE. PROJECTING OUT YOUR BUDGET DEFICITS IN THE GENERAL FUND AND SO WE THINK IT'S SIMPLY IMPORTANT THAT WITH- MAGNITUDE. OF MAGNITUDE OF IMPORTANT ENSURE THAT THE OUT YOUR COST FOR ONE TO STAY IN YOUR LONGER TERM GENERAL FUND PLAN. SEE MR FAVREAU I'M I KNOW THE PART OF THE- AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE DEMOLITION AND I KNOW THEY DID THE EVE YOU'VE GIVEN US ARE THREE CATEGORIES ON ON THIS STRATEGIC FIREFIGHTING BUT I WANT TO FLIP OVER TO THE FORESTRY SIDE ANY IDEA THAT THAT. WE'RE LOOKING TO GET MORE FORSTER'S UP ENOUGH UP IN THE AREA ARE ANY OF THESE FACILITIES POSSIBLE TO BE RETROFITTED OR PROVIDE SOME SORT OF SERVICES THAT THE THAT THE FORESTERS WOULD BE EITHER NOT FOR OUR EMERGENCY FACILITIES FOR YOU KNOW A HELIPAD AND ALL THAT THE KISS OTHER STRUCTURES BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED AT THE YOU'VE GOT SOME PROJECTS WHERE WE HAVE. THE FORMER INCARCERATED WE'RE GOING TO CONVERT IT TO A USE IN THE CCC'S GOT SOME OTHERS THERE'S JUST A MULTI USE FOR STATE. FOR THIS- THAT. THE I GUESS THE- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PORTION OF YOUR WORK. SO WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF THE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LIKE READ REPURPOSE SAYING A DISABILITY THAT WE WOULD CORRECTIVE LEAVE- YEAH I MEAN I BELIEVE WE COULD LOOK AT THOSE THOSE FACILITIES IF WE ARE LEAVING A- THAT- WHETHER THAT FACILITY MIGHT WORK- IT IT DOES DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS AS FAR AS WHAT LOCATION WHERE THE FACILITY IS IN RELATION TO. TO THE S. R. A. WHERE WE WOULD BE DOING THE WORK- THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF FACILITIES IN IN THIS- LOWS A WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT RELOCATION- IN IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THOSE FACILITIES ARE NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A- OF AN URBAN AREA- WHERE. FORTY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO THEY WEREN'T THEY WERE THEY WERE MORE REALLY- ADJACENT TO THE S. R. A. AND SO WERE. WERE OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED AND NOW WE ARE WE ARE FINDING THAT SOME OF THE STATIONS ARE NOW MORE IN AN URBAN AREA WHERE WHERE ACCESS IS MORE DIFFICULT AND- SO I GUESS MY ANSWER IS IT WOULD BE IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE SPECIFIC FACILITY BUT I THINK WE WOULD- WE WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT. AT- AND THAT IS A POSSIBILITY IF IT WERE A- WE CAN DO THAT. ALL RIGHT I'M WILL BE IN CONTACT CENTRE DOLLY. THANK YOU A RESERVE A COMMENT MAINLY I I'LL I GREW UP A MILE AND HALF FROM THE INTERMOUNTAIN CAMP WHICH IS ONE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO- REPURPOSE AND WE JUST DESPERATELY NEED. THESE PROJECTS TO GO FORWARD IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER IN MY MIND WE HAVE THE INITIAL TACK THAT WE NEED TO DO. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WITH THE OTHER STILL THE THIS SET UP RIGHT TO DO THAT YOU CAN. GET THERE QUICKER SO NUMBER ONE I THINK IS THIS TO PULL WE DO WE NEED TO DO IT CENTER Y. COSCO'S TALKING ABOUT ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BUT FIRST WE NEED TO GET BE ABLE TO GET RESPOND TO THESE LIGHTNING STRIKES IN MOSTLY JURIES. IT'S GONNA BE LIGHTNING THAT'S CAUSING THESE. FIRES AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT SO THE INITIAL ATTACK IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE AMOUNT FOR THE TAXPAYER DINNER THE DAY THE QUICKER YOU PUT OUT A FIRE ON WITH INITIAL TAX- THE MORE MONEY YOU CAN SAVE IN THE LONG RUN. IS WHEN WE HAVE THESE MEGA FIRES IT'S COSTING US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO THE THIS THIS IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO WHAT THE AMOUNT THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE THE TAXPAYER BY BEING ABLE TO GET ON THE INITIAL TAX SO FOR ME. THERE'S NO BRAINER I THINK THE QUICKER THE BETTER I THINK WE SHOULD FRONT LOAD THIS AND GET THESE PROJECTS COMPLETED. NOT NOT JUST TO GET TO THE PLANNING STAGE AND BUILD- I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE HELLA TAK IN BEAVER WERE I GET MY MAIL IT ONLY CAN FLY IN THE HELICOPTER CAN ONLY COME IN ONE WAY BECAUSE- IT'S TOO CLOSE TO SCHOOL SO IT ONLY HAS ONE PATH IN AND OUT WHEN YOU HAVE WIND PROBLEMS IT'S- IT ISSUE FOR THAT HELICOPTER TO GET IN AND OUT OF THERE. AND WE NEED THAT FOR REFUELING AND ABLE TO ATTACK THE STARS AND THE WIND USUALLY BLOWING WE HAVE EVENTS SO FOR ME I THINK WITH THE QUICKER THE BETTER AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND HOPEFULLY ANOTHER. PART OF THIS THE- HEARING. YEAH I WAS THINKING FOR K. IMPROVE- I DON'T SEE CENTER STERN STAND UP pREQUIRE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL BE IN CONTACT. WITH YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO. ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN TO GET A HOLD THAT MATTER OPEN- LET'S LOOK AT- DR WOODS AB THIRTY EIGHT DEFENSIBLE SPACE- N. O. CENTERS EASTERN I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY I MISSED IT I MISSED I CONNOR THE BUTTON OKAY. IT IS I JUST DIDN'T GET IT I DIDN'T GET A CLEAR ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. ABOUT OVERALL STRATEGY ACT I WASI WAS STILL LOOKING FOR THAT BASED ON THE ALEJO'S. ANALYSIS APPORTIONING. DOLLARS THINK ABOUT LONG TERM GOALS HERE I STILL HAVEN'T I STILL DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THAT. HOPING WE CAN MAYBE DRILL DOWN THERE COULD BE ENOUGH NEXT ITEM BUT- THE THOUGHT THAT WAS A RELEVANT QUESTION. YEAH DEFINITELY FAVREAU- THERE'S QUITE A FEW BRAND NEW- PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED HI- I GUESS PUT ON THE TAB OVER THE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN HERE VERSUS THE ONE SAID WE'RE THAT ARE CONTINUING PROJECTS AND THIS IS THE TIME TO BUILD THEM CAN YOU SHINE SOME LIGHT ON. THE PRIORITIES THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO THOSE- IT THIS IS PHASE AS I UNDERSTAND IT THESE PROJECTS WERE- ALL PROJECTS THAT WE HAD IN THE BUDGET. LAST YEAR- WE'RE NOT ABLE TO- TO GO FORWARD WITH BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL UNCERTAINTY LAST FISCAL YEAR- AS FAR AS SPECIFIC. PARTIES WITHIN THIS. GROUP OF PROJECTS IS THAT I GUESS I MEAN MAYBE IT'S BETTER FOR ISSUE TWENTY SECOND ACTUALLY RESERVED THIS DISCUSSION FOR THEN BUT JUST TO BE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW YOU'RE BALANCING PRIORITIES BETWEEN CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS SUPPRESSION RESOURCES PREVENTION RESOURCES YOU KNOW. THERE'S A LOT IN ONE. A LOT IN THIS ARENA RIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OVERALL JUST JUST A SENSE OF THAT THE SYSTEM MAYBE IT'S WITH FROM CHIEF PORTER BUT I JUST. I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF EMPHASIS HERE AND IT SORT OF. WHAT DO WE SEE FOR INSTANCE THE OVERALL LIABILITIES ON THE SUPPRESSION BUDGET LOOKING LIKE OVER TIME- IS THAT CAN INCREASE HOW SHORT OUR WEEK MEANS IT CENTER DOLLARS POINT. LIKE YOU WHAT EACH. ALL THOSE FOLKS WANT EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW AND IT'S STILL NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH WELL HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH. YOU KNOW JUST STARTING TO GIVE US A SENSE OF. WHAT THE OVERALL SORT OF SUPPRESSION LIABILITY IS AND ALSO. TO THAT POINT LIKE WHAT YOU THINK PREVENTION WILL SAVE US. ON THAT ON THAT END OF THINGS- BUT I CAN RESERVE THAT FOR TWENTY TWO THAT'S IT. MORE OF A STRATEGIC CONVERSATION. GO INTO YOUR SATURDAY PORTER. YES THEY THANK YOU- CHAIR WORK AS HE- SENATOR STIR LET ME JUST- BE VERY BRIEF- WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE- PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS YEAR. AS OF PARTLY OF BUDGET CONSTRAINED- KIND OF POINT OF VIEW. TARGETING THE RIGHT DOLLARS FOR THE RIGHT TYPE OF EFFORTS THAT WILL GET US- FURTHEST INTO THE FUTURE- TO HOPEFULLY BETTER TIMES- WITH BUDGETS AND I KNOW BILLION DOLLARS IS A HUGE BUDGET- AND THESE ITEMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW OR ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT SO. SO I CAN'T THANK THE GOVERNOR ENOUGH OF A WERE ALL OF YOU FOR CONSIDERING THESE INVESTMENTS. THEY ARE VERY MUCH STRATEGICALLY- KIND OF SPREAD IN ORDER TO BUILD ALL PARTS OF THE DEPARTMENT- AND THE NEEDS FOR FOREST AND WILDLAND MANAGEMENT- STRUCTURE HARDENING ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT LATER. ALL OF THEM ARE KIND OF PUT TOGETHER IN A IN A PUZZLE A SET OF PUZZLE PIECES CHU SH YEAH SHE HAD THE FULL PICTURE A AND I AM COMFORTABLE THAT WE ARE DOING. THAT WITH THIS- THIS BUDGET ASK. OKAY YEAH I THINK THE MORE WE'LL GET A HOLD THIS I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER WAYS THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THIS IS SAID LET'S JUST SAY WE FOUND. EIGHT OR TEN BILLION DOLLARS KICKING AROUND IN THE BUDGET AND WE SAID INSTEAD OF SPENDING FIFTY FIVE MILLION WE WANT TO SPEND THREE HUNDRED MILLION SO WHAT WOULD YOU COME BACK TO US AND YOUR PRIORITIES AND SAYING. IF WE GO TO GO TO CONSTRUCTION THIS IS WHAT WE WANT OR IF THIS IN SORT OF IN THAT VEIN IS WE'RE WE'RE IS THE BIGGEST NEED GIVEN THE NEW NORMTHAT WE HAVE BUT- WILL HOLD THE MATTER. THE DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE AND- I REALIZE THAT WE'RE ALL HERE SO. S. ROY FIVE ONE TO CALL THE ROLL AND LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WIECKOWSKI HERE MY CASKEY HERE DOLLY DOLLY HERE MCGUIRE YOUR REQUIRE HERE STERN. STERN HERE STERN HERE. HI WE HAVE A QUORUM IS BEEN ESTABLISHED SINCE THAT'S GREAT LET'S MOVE ON TO DEFENSIBLE SPACE LET'S MOVE ON TO- FUNDING A PROGRAM SO PEOPLE CAN SELL THEIR HOUSES IN THEIR IN THE WILL BE AND WHERE THE SOURCE OF THAT MONEY'S GONNA COME FROM- THAT. LET'S SIR I GUESS WE HAVE THE FIRE MARSHAL- MARSHALL RICHWINE A RICH ONE. THE MORNING YOU ACTUALLY HAVE- ASSISTANT STATE FIRE MARSHAL WENDY COLLINS- THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MICHAEL OF YOUR TIME I OPENING STATEMENTS WILL BE FREE- ALLOWING US TO GET TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE- WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE REQUEST OF A POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY SIX POSITIONS. STARTING IN TWENTY ONE FUNNY TEAR. APPLE BE NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OVER QUOTA SO SEATED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB THIRTY EIGHTH. AND THE SUBSEQUENT TRAINING AND STAFFING TWENTY ONE NEW FORESTRY TECHNICIAN POSITIONS. THOSE FOLKS WILL BE TASKED WITH EVALUATION AND CERTIFICATION OF STRUCTURE HEARTENING MEASURES AND THE PROPERTIES DEFENSIBLE SPACE COMPLIANCE TO THE BUYERS OF HOME HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SOME. AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL IT WAS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE PROGRAM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE D. SPACE PROGRAM. HE SPACES STOP WAS SEASONAL FORESTRY AIDS THIS PROGRAM IS STOCKED WITH PERMANENT FORESTRY TECHNICIANS. THE SERVICE SEVERAL SERVICE CLASSIFICATION REQUIRES A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF TRAINING AND IS THE ENTRY LEVEL POSITION LEADING TO PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FORESTRY ASSISTANT ONE AND TWO POSITIONS. THE SPACE PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON MEETING THE CAL FIRE GOAL OF COMPLETING THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. IT'S A BOLD FACE INSPECTIONS ANNUALLY. THIS PROGRAM AND THE TWENTY ONE FORESTRY TECHNICIANS WILL BE FOCUSED ON THE EVALUATION OF STRUCTURES AND ANY HOME HARDENING MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED. IN CERTIFYING THAT THAT INFORMATION AS PART OF THE HOME SALE IN HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES IN THE US ALL RIGHT. AGAIN THIS IS AN ENTRY LEVEL POSITION WITH UPWARD MOBILITY POTENTIAL SO IT SHOULD NOT BE ANTICIPATED THAT THE ADDITIONAL STOP WITH READ ONLY A ONE TIME ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. BUT THAT MOTIVATED STAFF WILL BE USING THIS AS AN ENTRY LEVEL POSITION AS A STEPPING STONE TO MEET THEIR CAREER GOALS AND HOPEFULLY SUPPORT DEPARTMENT AS FORESTRY ASSISTANCE. MAKING TURN OVER. REALITY THAT WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR. WITHOUT THE DECISION STAFFING AND EQUIPMENT REFER FOR THE TRAINING CENTER. AND DAVIS PUBLIC BUT MEANT TO SUPPORT THE INITIAL HIRES AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT IS NECESSARY TO BETWEEN TRAIN AND WHAT WE GET BUT WORK FOR- I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS WHICH- WE'LL GET TO THE- THE WHOLE NEW PROGRAMS WE HAVE. THIS ALLEY- POINTS OUT THAT. YOU'RE NOT AUTHORIZED TO SIT TO- LEVY A FEE FOR THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE IT TO THE HOMEOWNERS. ESPECIALLY I WILL NOTE THAT THIS IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE SELLING THEIR HOUSES I MEAN THERE'S AN ESCROW SOME BUYERS PUT DOWN SOME MONEY THEY'RE DOING THAT. WHY ARE YOU NOT ASKING US FOR AUTHORITY TO JUST YOU KNOW A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE TO SAY WHAT YOUR SERVICES THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING. THAT HOMEOWNERS COULD PAY FOR IT IN THE TWENTY HOMES THAT WERE SOLD IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. I'M I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECALL THAT THAT WE'VE TRIED A FEE BEFORE- AND WHAT REALLY ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS IT IT IT IT DAMAGED OUR OUR OUR REPUTATION AND OUR ABILITY TO WORK WITH WITH THE PEOPLE THESE HOMEOWNERS IN THESE WHAT WE AREAS IT'S JUST SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT REALLY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP SO THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO HEAR OUR MESSAGE ABOUT- BARGAINING AND PROTECTING- THE AREA. HELLO BUT THIS DON'T YOU THINK THIS IS REALLY A DIFFERENCE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE WILL IT'S ONE THING FOR ME TO GO ON TO YOUR PROPERTY DO AN INSPECTION SAY GET RID OF THIS TREE THIS TREE BY ABOUT THAT AND HERE'S YOU'LL BE A HUNDRED FIFTY BUCKS IT'S ANOTHER I'M SOMEONE I'M MOVING TO AUSTIN TEXAS WHEREVER PEOPLE GO ON THE WYOMING AND YOU SAY OKAY YOU WANT TO SELL THIS HOUSE THIS IS FOR THE NEW BUYER AND THIS IS WHAT THE FEE IS AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CASH PUT IT INTO THE ESCROW WHICH IS THIS IS THERE'S A TRANSACTION THAT'S HAPPENING. I DON'T WANT TO GET ARGUMENTATIVE BECAUSE I JUST I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM I'M. VERY INTERESTED IN THE ALLEY OWES. IDEA ON THIS THIS THIS. OF IT THIS THE PORSCHE OF PEOPLE SELLING THEIR HOUSES THIRD LEAVING. BELIAU WHO'S- THIS IS MR BROWN AGAIN. YES GOOD MORNING PRIME BROWN WITH L. A. L. AGAIN- SO FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET REQUEST WE THINK THAT- MOST OF THEREQUEST IS. A WARRANTED CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB THIRTY EIGHT SO I ANY ADDITIONAL FACTORS AND THE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAKE SENSE WE DID HAVE TWO TECHNICAL- RECOMMENDATIONS I JUST MEANT THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND. ALLUDED TO BY MS COLLINS- WHEN ONE OF THEM IS THAT- THERE'S ONGOING POSITION REQUESTED TO DO TRAINING OF NEW INSPECTORS AND ALSO PROCUREMENT OF THEIR VEHICLES. WE SUGGESTED THAT BE ONE TIME IN NATURE THAT DEFINITELY WILL BE A REPLACEMENT PROCESS- NOT NECESSARY OVER THE LONGER TERM BY THE BOOK OF THE WORKLOAD WILL BE KIND OF FRONT LOAD IT. IN IN THE SECOND TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT IS- THAT THERE'S A ONE TIME REQUEST FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PURCHASE A NEW FIRE ENGINE FOR USE AT THE SOUTHERN TRAINING FACILITY- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT PORTION OF THIS REQUESTED THAT'S NOT REALLY DIRECTLY RELATED AB THIRTY EIGHT IMPLEMENTATION- TO YOUR HERE. POINT MISTER CHAIR- YEAH WE DID RAISE THIS QUESTION CURRENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE DEPARTMENT OF NOT HAVE AUTHORITY TO CHARGE A FEE FOR- FOR THESE ACTIVITIES AND WE DID RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WORTH. THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION ENGAGING IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT YOU POINT OUT I THINK IN OUR VIEW THIS IS MORE OF A- DIRECT SERVICE IN IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM A HOMEOWNER PROPERTY OWNER UPON SALE. ON IN IN THE OTHER ADVANTAGE OF- CONCERNING THE CREATION OF A FEE OF FORTY FOR THIS ACTIVITY WOULD BE THAT ULTIMATELY THAT REVENUE THEN WOULD OFFSET THE NECESSITY FOR USING GENERAL FUND ON AN ONGOING BASIS. FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND IF I COULD WE JUST HAD ONE OTHER SNOW RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO ADOPT A REPORTING LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROGRAM ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND- THIS IS REALLY JUST THAT REFLECT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A BRAND NEW WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND SO. WE THOUGHT THEY TOOK A REASONABLE APPROACH TO ESTIMATING WHAT THE ONGOING WORKLOAD WOULD BE- BUT THERE'S A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY BY VIRTUE OF IT BEING MALE AND THE. THE REASON WE THINK THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN- TWO WEEKS. THAT COULD BE HIGHER THAN INTO. IN THE BUDGET REQUEST. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT HAVE TO DIVERT RESOURCES FROM OTHER. PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY MEET THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED- WORKLOAD AND SHOW- TO CAN WE HAVE SOME REPORTING ON ON WORKLOAD GOING FORWARD THAT COULD INFORM FUTURE. ADJUSTMENTS WE MIGHT NEED TO MAKE TO FUND THE PROGRAM APPROPRIATELY. FILLETING GAUGE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION MISTER BENSON MISS MORE AT FINANCE. YOUR RECOGNIZED MISTER BENSON. MORNING MR THANK YOU STEVEN BENSON APARTMENT FINANCES JUST VERY BRIEFLY AS FAR TO SAY LIKE WE COMPLETELY OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION- I THINK MILAN'S OF THE ADMINISTRATION PART OF THE REASON WHY WE DIDN'T WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY WE DIDN'T PROPOSE THE AUTHORITY FOR HE IS LOOKING OUT FOR ME IN A BIG BENEFIT PERSPECTIVE- THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A BENEFIT TO THE HOME SELLER AND HOMEBUYER. AND THIS TRANSACTIONS YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S NO ARGUMENT THERE I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LARGER PUBLIC BENEFIT TO THE MEANT TO BE SPENT THE WEEK IN CENTRALIZING MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO CREATE A MENTAL SPACE AND THE SAFETY THAT IT CREATES ROUND COMMUNITIES AND HOMES SO I THINK PART OF IT WAS THAT WAS OUR VIEW AND JENNIFER WAS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE GENERAL BENEFIT BUT AGAIN CERTAINLY UP IN THE CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S A GOOD ONE TO HAVE. A LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS RECOGNIZE SENATOR STERN- HAS HIS. HEAD UP AND THEN I'LL GO TO SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IT GOES BACK TO THE SAME THING THAT WE TRY TO GET ON THE MY FIRST QUESTION JUST IN TERMS F HOW THIS FITS INTO THE BROADER STRATEGY SO AND JUST AND JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE MY LAST POINT IT WAS NOT- THAT WE MAY BE OVERSHOOTING THE BUDGET HERE I DON'T WANT TO BE MISTAKEN IN THAT REGARD I. AGREE WITH CHIEF PORTER BILLION DOLLARS SOUNDS BIG- BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIRE LIABILITIES STATE IT'S ACTUALLY. IT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET- SO I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT WE MAY BE OVERSHOOTING IT I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW THE PUZZLE PIECES FIT TOGETHER AND IN FACT I THINK A PROPER NEEDS ASSESSMENT WOULD REVEAL THAT WE ARE UNDER SHOOTING THE BUDGET HERE. AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT ASSESSMENT REALLY DRIVES AND NOT JUST ABOUT AVOIDED ACREAGE BURNED BUT ABOUT STRUCTURAL DEFENSE AND TO THAT END NO MY QUESTION ON THIS ONE IS IT LOOKS IT LOOKS SORT OF ORIENTED ON COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION AND TRANSACTION BASED. ON THE DATA HERE SAYS THAT THAT SAY ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND HOME SOTHE NECESSARY. TERRITORY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT- BUT BETTER SEVEN OR THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE THERE BUT- THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY. LIVE IN THE WILL WE THIS ISN'T MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SELL THEIR- HOMES AND LEAVE THE WILL EAT AT IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S THE TARGET HERE. WHAT WE NEED TO ALSO PICK THEM TO GO BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL ROUTE- AND THAT IS TO PROTECT THE WILDLAND FROM THE HOME HAS AN EXISTING NATIONS. SO BANTER ABOUT BE A BENEFIT FOR THE ENTIRE THING- KEEPING DURING THOSE INSPECTIONS MAKING SURE THAT THE NEW HOMEOWNER OR THAT THE OLD HOMEOWNER- HAS HAS APPROPRIATELY FOR THE TECH TO THAT- FACILITY. FROM CREATING A FIRE HAZARD- THE- WHICH- GOES BACK TO SENATOR DOLLIES COMMENTS ABOUT MAKING YOU KNOW THOSE INITIAL ATTACKS AND THIS WOULD BE EFFECTIVELY AN INITIAL ATTACK BEFORE THE FIRE- WHICH PROVIDES A BENEFIT FOR THE INTENTION I UNDERSTAND TRYING TO GET. MY SPIDER VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION. WHO'S THE TARGET AUDIENCE HERE IS THE BACK TRANSACTIONS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE THE COMMUNITY NOT EXISTING STRUCTURES OF PEOPLE ARE STATE CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY SO HOW MANY HOW MANY HOW HOW MANY TRANSACTIONS YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET TO WITH THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AB THIRTY EIGHT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE COMPLIANT SAYS ALL OF THEM. ALL OF THEM IN THE I'M SORRY. IN THE HIGH AND VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ONCE. SHAPE SO YOU. THE GOAL IS TO COVER EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION IN THOSE AREAS. IN THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR WITH THIS MONEY. YES. IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE BASING THAT OFF THANK SAID THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR SO IN THEORY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES. OKAY UNDERSTOOD SO YES. MY QUESTIONS ABOUT JUST WHAT WHAT ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE. I DON'T NEED TO BE I DON'T NEED TO BE CONVINCED OF THE EFFICACY OF. DOING DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS OF MOVE LEGISLATION ON THIS AT THE LEGISLATION VETOED WE'VE HAD LEGISLATION NOT FUNDED. YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR SO THANK YOU ACTUALLY FOR FINALLY FINDING SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE IT'S TAKEN US. THREE YEARS TO GET HERE SINCE AB THIRTY EIGHT PASS AND IT KEEPS FALLING OFF THE TABLE WHAT WE FIND EVERYTHING ELSE SO. DEFINITELY DON'T NEED TO BE CONVINCED THE EFFICACY I JUST WORRY WERE COMPLETELY UNDER SHOOTING IT WE WERE JUST TALKING AT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. OUR TIME AT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE'RE QUIBBLING OVER ARE WE GOING TO COVER ENOUGH TRANSACTIONS. WHAT ABOUT THE ALMOST MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA BE LEFT BEHIND BY THIS. HOUR THOSE HOMES GOING TO BE INSPECTED AND WHAT WE DO WITH. ALL THE INSURANCE FALL OUT THEY WERE ABOUT TO FACE IN THIS COMMUNITY SO. IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT THE TECHNICAL ABOUT FOR UPCOMING DISCUSSIONS BUT- IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE. WE'RE ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IS EVERYONE LIVING IN THIS RISK WHO IS STAYING. NOT TRANSACTING IN LEAVING. AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MAKE THOSE COMMUNITIES HART- THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO ADDRESS THAT SO MAYBE IN THAT ISSUE TWENTY WE- WRESTLE. A LITTLE BIT WITH THE LINKAGE BETWEEN. THIS RETRO THE SORT OF TRY. SPACE AND THEN EVERYBODY ELSE SO. THANK YOU ALL ON DAILY NOTED WE WILL- CONTINUE WITH THIS CONVERSATION CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCHER- IN. THANK YOU SYSTEM FOR MARSHALL AND I THINK IT'S IN THE STERN FOR THE COMMENTS AS WELL LOOK I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS FOR ME ALL SEASON COMMENTS IN JUST. SOME QUICK A QUICK QUESTION. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS YEAR AFTER YEAR. IT'S UNDERWHELMING AND WE NEED A MODERN A PERMANENT FUNDING SOURCE FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN HOME HARDENING IN WHY WE ARE HERE. ALMOST THIRTY SIX MONTHS LATER TO THE DAY WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED- AB THIRTY EIGHT. AND IT'S NOT BEEN FUNDED. AND CONTINUES TO STRIP THE FUNDING- JUST MY MIND IS BLOWN. AT IN THE TO BE HONEST THE AB THIRTY EIGHT HAD FUNDING ATTACHED. IT WAS STRIPPED OUT. SO ON THE S. R. AMFI I AM 110% AGAINST THE S. R. AMFI WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS HERE ABOUT ON FAIRLY. TAXING RURAL RESIDENTS WHEN THEY DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE THE SERVICES CAL FIRE BUT WHERE THE- CHAIR WAS SAYING IS THAT IF THIS IS- A FEE ATTACHED TO A HOME WHO NEEDS THE SERVICE TO BE ABLE TO SELL AND THAT'S JUST BE CANDID AT THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE FOR CALIFORNIANS IS THEIR HOME. SO THIS IS A POTENTIAL EQUITABLE APPROACH. NOT JUST BASED ON AND A GEOGRAPHY OF WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL LIVES WHICH I THINK OF CHOOSING MORE EQUITY SO I A LOT OF COMMENTS HERE AND I WOULD JUST SAY I WOULD HOPE MISTER CHAIR. THAT WE COULD HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION ON THIS AND CANDIDLY I JUST DON'T THINK THE ERLY ACTION THAT IS BEING PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET IS AT ALL ADEQUATE. FOR WHERE WE NEED TO GO FOR FIRE PREVENTION AS WELL AS FIRE THE DISCUSSION IN THE WEEKS TO COME. WE'LL GET TO THAT AN ITEM. TWENTY I DO HAVE CENTER DOLLARS. TO LOOK THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE ABOUT THE S. R. A. T. THAT DID NOT REALLY GO TO ANYBODY IN ONE OF THE GENERAL FUND WAS SPENT ON ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN S. R. AREA. AND FOR MY DISTRICT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HISTORY I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE ANSWER TODAY BUT LIKE SOME FOLLOW UP ON I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY- HOMES BURKE AT WAR. IN SRH CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WE ARE TALK ABOUT AND WE WE'VE BEEN BEGGING FOR. SOMEBODY IN THE DEPARTMENT. WHETHER IT'S- A LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WHETHER IT'S A- CAL FIRE SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT INSPECT AND HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEED TO MAKE THEIR- PROPERTY SAFE WHETHER YOU'RE SELLING OR NOT. THERE WERE ONLY TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE ARE SELLING HOMES HERE WHAT ABOUT THE- PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME I NEVER WANT TO LEAVE THEIR- SO. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME NEXUS TO EVERYBODY THAT LIVES IN S. RA SOME RESOURCE OR SOME ABILITY BE ABLE TO ACCESS SOMEBODY COME OUT AND TELL THEM HOW TO KEEP THEIR HOME SAFE. AND THAT'S A GOOD SEGUE FOR OUR NEXT ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN THANK YOU EVERYBODY WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE STAFF TO GET BACK TO YOU ONE. OF THE THINGS THAT WE TOUCHED ON AN ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN WE'RE GOING TO HOLD. ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE HAND CREWS AND THE CCC AND THE- FOUR. FORESTRY DEPARTMENT- THE STATE DIRECTOR PORTER I THINK A- YEAR ON. ANIMAL HAVE- DIRECTOR SZETO FROM CCC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN AND- I AM JUST GOING TO STAND ON THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE PREVIOUSLY AS AN OPENER. AND PASSED TO- DEPUTY DIRECTOR- TYLER WHO WILL TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE CRUISE AND- AND THEN I WILL ALSO- DEFER TO. A DIRECTOR SAIDO- IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC. ISSUES RELATED TO US THE CDC. THE BILL DIRECTOR TYLER THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR WHERE CASCADING GOOD MORNING FELLOW SENATORS ON THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOE TYLER AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FIRE PROTECTION. I IN THIS PROPOSAL CAUGHT FIRE IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS REQUESTING A HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX. THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND AND GENERAL FUND PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS- AND AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN POSITIONS ON GOING TO HAVE THIRTY ADDITIONAL HAND CREWS. TO PROVIDE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT HAZARDOUS FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT WORK AND WILDLAND FIRE SUPPRESSION. THIS PROPOSAL WILL STAFF SIXTEEN FIREFIGHTER HAND CREWS AT SEVEN OF THE DE. CONSERVATION CAMP FACILITIES STAFF EACH YEAR ROUND SEE SEE SEE HAND CREWS FOR CCC FACILITIES. STAFF SIX ADDITIONAL I SEE SEE SEE WHO'S OFFICIALS EXISTING FACILITIES DURING. THE FIRE SEASON. AS A FEBRUARY SEVEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. CALIFORNIA HAVE THREE HUNDRED WILDLAND FIRES BURNING THE SAME TIME FRAME IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. CALIFORNIA SO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN WILDLAND FIRES FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN ACRES. THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE RIGHT NOW IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIRES FOR SEVENTY ONE ACRES. RELATED TO THE ACT PROPOSAL HOW FIRE IS SEEN A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FIRE CREWS AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE EMERGENCIES. THIS DECREASE IS A RESULT IN A FEWER NUMBER CREWS AVAILABLE TO PERFORM CRITICAL FUEL REDUCTION WORK. AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT HELP ENFORCE HEALTH. HOW FAR HISTORICALLY HAD A DESIGNED CAPACITY OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHT. FIVE ONE ARE FIGHTING HAND CREWS INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO FIRE CREWS THROUGH COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TWELVE HAND ROOSTER PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HAND CREWS OF IT'S A JOINT EFFORT WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES AS PART OF A TRAINING PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY TRAINING CENTER. OVER THE LAST DECADE THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CAMP PROGRAM IS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF FIREFIGHTERS AVAILABLE TO FULLY STAFF ITS FAR TREES. WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE OPERATION OF FEWER HANG INCREASE THE SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS AND PLAY AS A DISPUTE REDUCTION PROJECTS. IN RECOGNITION OF THE TREND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET REFLECTED A CONSOLIDATION OF INMATE FIREFIGHTERS AND THE POPULATION OF A CAMP FACILITIES- BY CDC ARE. TODAY ACCOUNT- CURRENTLY HAS AN APPROVED DESIGN CAPACITY OF A HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT HAND CREWS. OUT WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO OF THEM COMING FROM CDC ARE WELL FROM CCC AND FOR RELATED TO THE VENTURA TRAINING CENTER PROGRAM. OUT OF THIRTY CONSERVATION CAMPS FOR FIRE CENTERS IN ONE TRAINING CENTER. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A CO WRITTEN BY REMEMBER WE'RE ONLY ABLE STAFF TODAY A TOTAL OF FIFTY THREE OF THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT FULLY TRAINED AND QUALIFIED. ARE FIGHTING HAND CREWS AS OF JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH R. WHICH WAS OUR LAST CAN'T COUNT. ANOTHER TWENTY ENTRIES ARE AVAILABLE IN THEIR LOCAL AREAS BUT THEY HAVE TO FEW CREW MEMBERS. ARE TO BE TYPED AS A FULLY TRAINED AND QUALIFIED HANGRY BY STATE NATIONAL. STANDARDS BUT THEY ARE AVAILABLE LOCALLY. FIRE CREWS. ARE WANT THE MOST VERSATILE SPECIAL RIES. CALIFORNIA AFTER FIRE SUPPRESSION WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AVIATION ASSETS AND WE APPRECIATE THE- SUPPORT BY THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION. BUT THESE HANGERS ARE ALSO A VERY SPECIALIZED AND VERSATILE RESOURCE THE CLEAR VEGETATION AWAY FROM. THE ONCOMING FIRE THEY WORK IN THE HEAD OF THE FIRE THERE OFTEN REMOTE TEAM WORK IN REMOTE AREAS. INACCESSIBLE TERRAIN WHICH BULLDOZERS AND OTHER APPARATUS CANNOT WORK AND- IN WITHOUT AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF PANTRIES FIRES. WILL LIKELY GROW LARGER RESULTING IN INCREASED DAMAGE TO WATERSHED WILDLIFE FISHERIES AND AIR QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE NOT RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE FIRE CREWS ENGAGE AND THAT FUEL REDUCTION VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. PRESCRIBED FIRES AND FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS WE RECENTLY REVIEWED- CALIFORNIA CREW UTILIZATION AT SEVEN OF EIGHTY CONSOLIDATED CONSERVATION CAMPS THE SHOW ON AVERAGE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND NINETEEN. OF THE CALIFORNIA CREWS IN THOSE SEVEN FACILITY SPENT 25% MORE TIME. RELATED CONSERVATION WORK. BEING SPENT ON FIRE SCIENCE NOW TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WAS A DEVASTATING YEAR AND WE KNOW THAT- THAT'S REASON- I HOPE GOES IN ON AN ANOMALY I FEAR THAT IT'S NOT BUT THE REASON WE TOOK THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO NINETEEN AVERAGE. GOVERNOR ALSO UTILIZES CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO AUGMENT FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIRE SEASON THE ADMINISTRATION ARGUMENT AND THE EMERGENCY FUND. TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL SEIZE ALL OF CCC CREWS AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT FIREFIGHTERS. TO ACTORS FIRE CREW MEMBERS AS PART OF A SURGE CAPACITY RELATED TO KOBE AND A DECLINING POPULATIONS. AGAIN CALIFORNIA HERE'S REQUESTING TO STAFF A SIXTEEN FIREFIGHTER CREWS WILL BE OPERATED ON THE SEVEN CONSERVATION CAMPS THAT WERE RECENTLY TO POPULATED. THOSE INCLUDE DEVIL'S GARDEN- CHAMBERLAIN CREEK. HIGH ROCK CAN'T VALLEY VIEW. BASELINE PILOT ROCK IN RAINBOW. IS FAR BETTER CREWS WILL BE STAFFED TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FOR NINE MONTHS A YEAR FROM BETWEEN MARCH FIFTEENTH. AND DECEMBER FIFTEENTH OF EACH YEAR. THE CREWS WILL BE STAFF WITH A FIRE CAPTAIN FIRE AFTER ENGINE IN A MIN OF THREE C. FIRE WEDNESDAY LEAD TO PERFORM REDUCTION WORK FIRE PREVENTION WORK. WHEN THEY'RE NOT ASSIGNED TO EMERGENCY INCIDENTS. THIS MODEL WILL PROVIDE ACTUALLY THIRTY ONE ADDITIONAL CREW DAYS OR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS A EAR WITH NINE MONTHS. OF FIREFIGHTER CREWS THAT ARE TRADITIONAL HAND THROUGH MODEL. DUE TO- WEEKENDS VISITATION AND OTHERWISE THAT PROVIDE AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE DAYS. A YEAR OF WORK- FIREFIGHTERS DO RIGHT NOW WORKING OUT AT WORK A SEVENTY TWO HOUR SHIFT- AND WITH SEVEN DAY WEEK COVERAGE CAL FIRE. CAN UTILIZE OFF DUTY PERSONNEL THE BACKFILL BEHIND TRUE ONCE IT'S COMMITTED. TO AN EMERGENCY INCIDENT THAT'S WHAT WE TYPICALLY CALL AT A STAFFING PATTERN. THE SURGE TRUE CAN BE UTILIZED FOR COVERAGE BEHIND THE FIRE CREW COMMITTED TO AN EMERGENCY INCIDENT. OR FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE THE NEW FIRES STAFFING OF SIXTEEN FIREFIGHTER CREWS STATEWIDE WILL PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WITH THE ABILITY POTENTIALLY TO SURGE TO THIRTY TWO FIRE CREWS JUST OUT OF THE SIXTEENS. I HAVEN'T FOLKS ON BOTH ENDS OF THE WEEK AND TIMES OF CRITICAL FIRE NEED. IN ADDITION THE FIREFIGHTER CREWS WILL BE STAFFED. TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AS IT RELATES TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS CALIFORNIANS C. C. C. HAS. A TWELVE YEAR ROUND BURKE THREE STAFF STATEWIDE THROUGH OURSTRONG RELATIONSHIP THAT'S EVER BUILDING. A CAMPFIRE IN THE CCC- REQUESTING THE STAFF. THE TRANSITION SIX EXISTING REIMBURSEMENT CCC CREWS AND A TYPE ONE WELL WE TRAINED AND QUALIFIED FIRE CREWS WHICH CRUISE IN TAHOE TWO AND A STOCKTON DELTA- AND- TWO IN THE UKIAH WILLITS AREA. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSAL ADDS TO EXPANSION CREWS TO THE LOS PINOS FACILITY- IN THE RIVERSIDE AREA. THE REQUEST INCLUDES AN ASSET OF ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN YEAR ONE AND TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION STARTING YEAR TWO FROM THE COLLEGE DUBLIN REIMBURSEMENT COUNT. REFLECTED THE SIX EXISTING REIMBURSEMENT CRUCIAL TRANSITION. TO BE FULLY FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND. THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING TO STAFF SIX CCC CREWS SEASONALLY DIS TO BOLSTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY. DURING THE PEAK FIRE SEASON ACTIVITIES ALSO PERFORM VEGETATION MANAGEMENT HAZARDOUS FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT ASSIGNED TO EMERGENCIES. FINALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE POSITIONS AND EQUIPMENT CONTAINED WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL ARE REALLY A COMBINATION OF REALLOCATED POSITIONS EQUIPMENT FROM THE EIGHT TO DE POPULATE CONSERVATION CAMPS AROUND THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL NEW POSITIONS TO MEET THE OPERATIONAL NEEDS FOR THE FOR THE HAND CRUZ. AGAIN ARE STRONG WORKING RELATIONSHIP FORM BETWEEN CALPERS CCC AND CDCR TO PROVIDE HAND CREWS TO CONDUCT FIRE SUPPRESSION FUEL REDUCTION OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT RELATED WORK RELATED WORK. I HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING IN CONTINUES TO GROW. SENATORS WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO PRESENT THIS PROPOSAL TODAY WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BUT I LIKE TO- DEFERRED TO DIRECTOR SIDE- IF HE HAS ANY COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE. DIRECTOR GOT PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND- I THANK YOU- A DEPUTY. DEPUTY CHIEF TYLER NO OF ALL THAT- DEPUTY CHIEF TYLER- DESCRIBED IS COMPLETELY BECAUSE WE GOT OFF. A LONG STANDING- OR WELL COORDINATED WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH CAL FIRE WE LOOK FORWARD TO. IMPLEMENTING THIS PROPOSAL- IN THE COMING MONTHS. X. LET'S HEAR FROM THE OUR WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- I'M GONNA HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THE MIX BETWEEN THAT CAL FIRE SIDE IN THE CCC BUT LET'S HEAR FROM THE ALEJO- MISTER. BROWN YES A GOOD MORNING AGAIN BRAND BROWN WITH L. A. L. SO OVERALL- WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRE CREW PROPOSAL WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT IN CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL- IS G. TYLER NOTED THERE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE- IN MAY CONSERVATION CAMP UP POPULATION. IT DROPPED BY OVER A THOUSAND ROUGHLY A THOUSAND EVEN BEFORE KOBE ED CHAU- AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF- SEVENTEEN CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN AND NOT GET OVER THE YEAR AND THE FIRE CREWS THAT SERVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR OVERALL FIRE RESPONDED WELL AS- HAS FUELED MITIGATION WORK- IF. BUT EVEN THOSE AMERICAN MIND WE DID HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- THE FIRST IS IT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO THINK ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IN LIGHT OF THE ONGOING GENERAL FUND. CONDITION THIS IS A NOTABLE ON GOING. GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- THEY HAD GOING. ON ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND AS I NOTED EARLIER OUR OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROJECT OUT YOUR GENERAL FUND SHORTFALL SO YOU'LL JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU DO APPROVED. THIS PROPOSAL OR OR- OR OF EVEN A PART OF IT THAT THAT IS THAT ONGOING GENERAL FUND PRIORITY- THE SECOND COMMENT IS- WE THINK THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY VALUE IN EXPLORING THIS OPTION A MINUTE THE CREATING THE NEW HAND CRUISING CALIFORNIA LITTLE BIT OF A NEW ACTIVITY THAT HAD MAKING THE FROM AN ONGOING HAND CREWS- WITH FIREFIGHTER ONES. THAT CREATE THE IS THE- WORK OPTION AGAIN BUT WE KNOW DID THE EXPENSIVE WAY TO CREATE CREWS RELATIVE TO OTHER THAT WE USE IN THE PAST WHETHER THAT UTILIZING. THE CONSERVATION CORPS- THE PROLIA TRAINING CENTER THAT YOU KILEY MENTIONED ADVENTURE- WE'VE ALSO CONTRACTED WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD. AND SO WE THINK IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE USING THE SPRING PROCESS TO EXPLORE WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHER WAYS. TO EXPAND THE HAN CREW- CAPACITY. FOR THE STATE WHETHER THAT'S EXPANDING ON SOME OF THESE OTHER OPTIONS THAT WE'VE USED IN THE PAST- OR WHETHER LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL OPTION FOR EXAMPLE WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- LASTLY THIS IS REALLY MORE OF A MINOR TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT- WHEN I MAKE SURE THAT CAN BE THE WHERE THERE IS A SMALL VERY SMALL PART OF. THIS PROPOSAL ABOUT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR CALIFORNIA TO WORK WITH CAL HR. UNDERTAKE A STUDY TO DETERMINE IF THERE SHOULD BE A NEW CLASSIFICATION CREATED FOR THE CALIFORNIA- HAND CREWS SO RATHER THAN USING FIREFIGHTER ONES IN THE FUTURE. WOULD THERE BE A NEW CLASSIFICATION THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO YOU GIVEN THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES WORKING ON THE HAN CREW RELATIVE TO. HOW YOU NORMALLY USE FIREFIGHTER ONES- WE THINK UNDERTAKEN THAT KIND OF EVALUATION MAKE. SENSE IF YOU PROCEED WITH THIS. THE PROPOSAL FROM THE MID- WE JUST HAVE KIND OF TECHNICAL. ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT- AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE FOR THAT WORKLOAD IS WE'RE STILL AWAITING SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- WE- ARE UNDERSTANDING THAT TYPICALLY THIS WOULD BE WORKLOAD. THAT CALLIE TARGET UNDERTAKE WITH EXISTING RESOURCES SO THAT'S SOMETHING. YOU MAY WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT OR WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH COMEDIANS WE LEARN MORE. YEAH THAT WAS GOOD POINT WE WANT WE WANT TO GET TO THAT I GUESS I'D LIKE TO START OFF. WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO THEIR PRISON POPULATIONS BEEN RELOCATED A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN COUNTY. A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE. HAVE WORKED EIGHT SEASONS IN THE FIRE CREW THEY DIDN'T JUST. DROP OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH HAVE WE DONE ANY EFFORT HAS THERE BEEN ANY EFFORT THIS TO REAL THOSE PEOPLE AND TO CREATE THE- HAN CREW. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE RIGHT THAT WE CAN WORK NINE NINE MONTHS SO THAT'S SORT OF THE- THE FIRST. BIT THEN THE SECOND IS HAVE WE CONTACTED COUNTIES WE CONTACTED THE COUNTIES AND THAT ARE NOW HOLDING PEOPLE FOR TWO THREE YEARS. AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK WITH THAT COUNTY. JAILER BUT HOW HAVE E EXHAUSTED DEAD OF GETTING THAT POPULATION IN. MY THIRD TRYING TO OF PEOPLE A- COLLEGE STUDENTS YOU KNOW IN. A NINE MONTH. PER GIG WITH THE WITH WITH THE CCC'S WITH THE FIRE SERVICE MAYBE SOMETHING THAT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO DO THAT ONE AT TAT. YEAH THERE WE READ ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND THERE'S A THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT NINE. NINE MONTHS AND THE FIRE CREW TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO BE. A PART OF THAT SO I GUESS. BECAUSE. THE DEPUTY. TYLER E. INDICATED THAT THERE WERE TWENTY EIGHT HAND CREWS THAT ARE. NOT COMPLETELY A CERTIFIED BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OUT AND THEY'RE NOT THERE HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN MAKE THOSE FALL FOR THAT. POST CODE BUT WE CAN GET THERE THE NUMBERS UP BUT HOW ABOUT IT'S A CHEAPER AND IT YOU KNOW IT'S A HEN CORRODED IT MAY BE MORE EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE AND GIVE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SENATOR REID CASKEY HAS SPECIFICALLY TO- THE TWENTY EIGHT HAND CREWS ARE NOT FULLY STAFFED TWENTY SEVEN OF THE TWENTY EIGHT HAND CREWS. ARE STAFFED BY ADULT MALE INMATES- SO- IT IS REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON THE- PIPELINE- ELIGIBLE ADULT MALE INMATES FIREFIGHTERS TO BE ABLE TO BOLSTER THOSE CREWS OUR ONLY OTHER OPTION IS TO BEGIN FURTHER CONSOLIDATION OF THOSE CREWS. TO BRING THEM UP ABOVE A MINIMUM STANDARD OF TWELVE MEMBERS ON THAT GROUP. TO MAKE IT YPE ONE TRUE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM FULLY FUNCTIONAL. BUT AT THIS POINT HAVING ONLY FIFTY THREE FIVE ONE TREES ACROSS THE STATE WERE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THE TWENTY EIGHT KEEP THE LOCAL FOR LOCAL RESPONSE SO THE OPTIONS YOU MIX THEM WITH. OTHER TYPES OF THREE MEMBERS IS NOT AN OPTION IN- THE INSTITUTIONAL. CORRECTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AS IT RELATES TO OTHER POORLY PROGRAM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT- THE VENTURA TRAINING CENTER IS- A PROGRAMS DESIGNED. TO ALLOW THE FOR LEASE- COMPETITIVE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENTRY LEVEL JOBS AND FIRE SERVICE AND CERTAINLY- THEY HAVE BEEN COMPETITIVE AND THOUGH I DO NOT HAVE STATS IN FRONT OF ME- THEY HAVE APPLIED FOR SOME HAVE APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED SEASONAL FOR BETTER JOBS WITH CAL FIRE WHICH IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM- TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THAT PROGRAM WERE. CONTINUING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR- PARTNERS. IN THAT ARENA BUT I. HAVE NOT DEVELOPED THAT FURTHER. SPECIFICALLY IT COULD ABOUT TO. HIST SEA FAR WAS A- SHORT SEASON AND EVEN MYSELF IN THE EARLY NINETIES OF- BEING ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL DURING THE WINTER AND FIGHT FIRE DURING THE SUMMER- TO GAIN MY EDUCATION THAT WERE ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA NOW WE'RE THE FIRE SEASON ISN'T THAT TYPICAL- JUNE TO OCTOBER- BUT RATHER WE'RE WE'RE GOING INTO DECEMBER MUCH OF WHERE THE COLLEGE STUDENTS. I WILL NEED TO RETURN TO SCHOOL IN THEIR BY DOWN STAFF WHOSE- BUT CERTAINLY- IT HAS BEEN A STRONG PART OF OUR SEASON. OKAY I JUST I KNOW THAT THE PAROLE. FOUR DON'T TALK TO THE PROBATION PEOPLE BECAUSE ONCE THAN A FELONY ONE TENDS TO MISTER METER AND WE SORT OF MERGE THEM TOGETHER AND I'M NOT EXPECTING KALIFORNIA CCC'S TO FIGURE OUT THAT BUT IT'S A IT'S AN ARTTHERE THERE IS THE POPULATION IS STILL HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THEREAFTER IT'S NOT CONVENIENTLY SITTING AT ONE PENAL INSTITUTION AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THESE PEOPLE HAVE DONE A SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA. EVERYBODY WANTS TO GIVE PEOPLE A SECOND CHANCE IN THIS JUST SOMEHOW IF I WERE GONNA SPEND MONEY WITH HR WITH FIND OUT WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE I WOULD IMAGINE THE BEEN ON THESE CRUISE FOR SEVEN YEARS AND NOW THEY'VE BEEN RELEASED AND THEY'RE STILL A VALUABLE ASSET TO US. WHO WHO TO CENTER MCGUIRE HERE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SO MUCH RICHER UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE TALKING PERSONNEL ALL FOCUS TO COMMENT. ON ISSUE NINETEEN. IN AND WANT TO SAY FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU- TO CHIEF PORTER IN THE ENTIRE CALFIRE TEAM FOR PAINTING THIS ALONG WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. LOOK AT ALL THIS WEEK SOME QUICK COMMENTS IN AND LOOK FOR A RESPONSE FROM COUNT FOR. THAT SINCE GOVERNOR'S MISTAKEN OFFICE- IN THE NINETIES TEN YEAR. HIS FOCUS ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE HE'S SHOWN UP AND BEEN ACTIVE IN ENGAGING THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HIT BY WILDFIRE. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE STATE IS FACING UNPARALLELED CHALLENGES RELATED TO WILDFIRES IN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. HAVE THEIR LIVELIHOODS AT RISK. AND WHILE CALIFORNIA IS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR FIRE FIGHTING FORCES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE WORLD. THEY'RE UNDERSTAFFED. AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE UNDERSTAFFED. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL. THAT'S IN FRONT OF US NEEDS ENHANCEMENT. AND HE FUNDING FOR PERSONNEL. HAND CREWS IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CREWS IN FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS ALONG WITH TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO GET FOLKS INTO AT THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND FIRE SERVICE I ALSO BELIEVE IN ALL- FOCUS THIS IN A BIT. THAT WE NEED A MODERN DAY PERMANENT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN BY THE WAY CHAIR WHITE HOUSE SKI HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS ON HOW WE INVEST MORE IN PREVENTIVE. HERE'S MY CONCERN. INMATE CREWS. THERE'S APPROXIMATELY. FOURTEEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN HUNDRED TWENTY REMAINING DOWN BY FIFTEEN HUNDRED FROM JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. WE'RE DOWN FORTY TWO HUNDRED INMATES ACCORDING TO CDC. WHO WERE ON ENEMY CREW FROM OVER A DECADE AGO. THIS YEAR AKAU FIGHTER THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN POSITIONS SIXTEEN SEASON CAUGHT FIRE CREWS SIX SEASONAL CCC CREWS IN EIGHT YEAR ROUND CCC CREWS. IT'S NOT ADEQUATE IN WHY WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT JUST EIGHT YEAR ROUND CCC CREWS WHEN THESE CREWS CAN DO A LOT OF THE WORK FOR MUCH LESS THAN THE PRICE I I'M NOT QUITE SURE I'D LIKE TO GET INTO THE FIREFIGHTING PEACE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE ASK FOR THIRTY ONE CAL FIRE FIRE ENGINES. ADMINISTRATION ONLY WANTED TO DO THIRTEEN AND BRING ON HUNDRED THIRTY ONE FULL TIME POSITIONS. THOSE THIRTY ONE FIRE ENGINES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WOULD HAVE ADVANCED BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED THREE EARNED FIFTY FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS. LAST YEAR TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS THAT WERE BROUGHT ON. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO BE A LOOK IT OVER FOR OUR EXITING OVER FIVE HUNDRED WHY THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE. AT THAT WERE PROPOSED AT FOR LAST YEAR BUT WE LOOKING AT YOUR TO YOUR FUNDING ISN'T BEING BROUGHT FORWARD THIS YEAR I'M NOT QUITE SURE BECAUSE THE REASON FOR THE OVER FIVE HUNDRED FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS ARE BEING. ASKED FOR LAST YEAR WAS REDUCED FATIGUE BUT TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR OVERTIME AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT POINT. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS WE SAY THAT WE'RE RELYING NATIONAL GUARD. DAHLE NATIONAL GUARD COMES IN AFTER ALL HELL'S BROKEN LOOSE IN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN BURNED DOWN. AND I GOTTA TELL YOU I SEEN THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. I'M TIRED. AND I'D LIKE TO BE A TO SEE A BUDGET THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MODERN DAY AND BE ABLE TO COMBAT BOTH THE FIRE PREVENTION AS WELL AS A FIRE PRESENT THAT RESPONSE IT IS NEEDED FUTURE I WENT ON A LITTLE LONG I APOLOGIZE- BUT THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS ON WHY I BELIEVE WE NEED ENHANCE BUDGET THIS YEAR. FOR PREVENTION RESPONSE VERY QUICKLY CENTER DOLLY I JUST WANT TO ADD TO COMMONSENSE AND REQUIRE. LOOK WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON PUTTING FIRES OUT THAT ARE. A THREAT. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT LOOK WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GET OUT OF THE CYCLE. INTEL WE DO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND DO IT AGGRESSIVELY AND THAT MEET IN MY MIND ITS CONTRACTORS. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE THE WORKFORCE. WITH STATE EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO GET DONE OUT THERE. AND ON TOP OF THAT WE NEED TO BE PARTNERING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE A LARGE PORTION OF THE LANDS IN CALIFORNIA OUR- ARE. OWNED BY THEM AND THEY IN THERE'S A THERE'S A HUGE NEXUS BETWEEN WILDLAND FIRE FORCED AND GIVEN IT OR A SORRY SO IT'S GOTTA BE A OF A JOINT VENTURE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO MAKE THIS WORK. WELL WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN- WE DO HAVE SIXTEEN AGENCIES OR DEPARTMENTS OR- ENTITIES THERE NOW ON ITEM NUMBER TWENTY WE COULD INVITE THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAKE IT SEVENTEEN GROUPS BUT WE'LL JUST. KEEP IT AT THE SIXTEEN THAT WE HAVE- THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THIS IS THE TWENTY MILLION. ACRES THAT ARE. IN THE THREAT OF FORCE FIRE AND WE HAVE A PROPOSAL TO TAKE CARE FOR PORTION OF THOSE SO. WHO IS GOING TO START OFF WORD. LET'S HAVE A RESOURCE AGENCY OF MISS MORSE BURMESTER ON. THE SYSTEM CASH SECRETARY. IN THE MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US TODAY GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR LEADERSHIP ON WORKING ON THIS WILDFIRE CRISIS WHEN ASKED WE AGREED THAT PREVENTION IS CRITICAL TO BEING ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE. OUR WELFARE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IS A MULTI GENERATIONAL CRISIS IN THE MAKING AND WE HAVE LESS THAN A GENERATION TO SOLVE INTEREST YEARS TO BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE AND GUESTS TO STATE OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE IN CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A LARGE PROPOSAL SHE WILL GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A FOUNDATION IN- WE'RE WE STAND RIGHT NOW AS A STATE IN THE FIRE CRISIS. YOU TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR WHICH WE ARE DECIDING WHAT TO FIND HOW TO FIND IT AND MOVE FORWARD TO ACHIEVE HIGHER RESILIENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN REALLY DIVING IN ON THE ISSUES WITH IN THIS BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO BE ABLE TO RAMP UP AND SCALE UP OUR AFFECTED NETWORKS- ON A WILD. RESILIENCE SO I HAVE- SOME SLIDES AND I'M GONNA pLIKE I CAN'T SO I WILL JUST- TALK THROUGH AT LEAST AT CHALLENGES SO THIS LAST YEAR IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FIVE OF THE SIX LARGEST FIRES IN THE STATE BURNING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND- AND- WE HAD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DISPLACED WE HAD TOXIC SMOKE- ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOR WEEKS IMPACTING. PEOPLE'S HEALTH. AND THIS IS A- INCREASE FROM WE'VE SEEN IN PREVIOUS. HE QUICKLY SEGMENT IN TWENTY. PREDICTED THAT WE WOULD SEE 18% 77% INCREASE IN CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE- BY THE END OFTHE CENTURY 77% INCREASE IN ANNUAL ACRES BURNED. THIS LAST YEAR WE HAD FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES BURNED IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN. THOUSAND ACRES BURN THAT'S A 15100% INCREASE IN ONE FIRE SEASON ALONE AT FOUR FOLD INCREASE OVER OUR ANNUAL AVERAGE OUT BEFORE THIS YEAR. AND SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THE PREDICTIONS OF THE CRIME AB PLANET REDUCTIONS THAT WE ANTICIPATED AT THE END OF THE CENTURY OUR RIGHTS EIGHTY YEARS EARLY. WHICH MEANS OUR ACTION HAS TO BE FAST. SWIFT AND STRATEGIC. WE KNOW THAT CAL. HAS HAD TYPICALLY H. ED IN MOST OF CALIFORNIA IS A FIRE ADAPTED A COLICKY TRIBES MANAGED AB CHOIR THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR MILLENNIA. I'M COLONIZATION SUPPRESS THOSE PRACTICES GOLD RUSH ERA CLEAR CUTTING REMOVED ABOUT 97% OF THE OLD GROWTH ARE FORCED HER BACK OVERLY DENSE. THE POLITICS OF THE EARLY TURN OF THE CENTURY FORCED THE CONSERVATION MOVEMENT TO PRESENT THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE AT THE FIRE SUPPRESSION ENTITY. SETTING UP TO REMOVE THE NATURAL OF FIRE ON CALIFORNIA'S ECOLOGY AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT NOW WE HAVE OUR NATURAL FIRE RETURN INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE OFF. SO BAD NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND STOP FIRED AFTER THE COLLEGES WHICH LIKE TO SEE FIRE EVERY FIFTEEN. TO TWENTY YEARS ARE GETTING FIRES- EVERY HUNDRED YEARS CREATING INCREDIBLY HIGH SEVERITY BURN DEVASTATING ECOSYSTEMS AND WILDLIFE. I'M CENTER CAP OR A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHAPARRAL ECOSYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE PREFERS THE FIRE EVERY SIXTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED YEARS NURSING EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS WHAT THIS IS LEADING TO ITS VEGETATION TYPE CONVERSION. WE ARE LOSING OUR CHAPARRAL ECOSYSTEMS TO INVASIVE GRASSES WE'RE LOSING CONNOR FOR FORCED YOU CHAPARRAL AND SO WE ARE SEEING A SHIFT. THIS IS NOT ONLY A LOSS OF HABITAT AND BIODIVERSITY IT'S CAUSING CASCADING CLIMATE IMPACTS- WE ARE LOSING OUR WATERSHED. WE ARE SEEING CATASTROPHIC MUDSLIDES OFTEN THESE FIRES AND WHAT'S pTHESE FIRES ARE PART OF CASCADING CLIMATE EVENTS THEMSELVES. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A ONE THOUSAND YEAR DROUGHTS FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY FIFTEEN IN CALIFORNIA THAT STRESS THESE OVERLY DENSE FOREST AND EDUCATION WRIT LARGE. LEADING TO INTENSE OF TREE MORTALITY HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION TREES DIED DROUGHT- THE STATE DURING THIS EPISODE OF TREE MORTALITY THOSE TREES HAD BEEN STANDING. THERE NOW ON THE GROUNDS AND THEY ARE CREATING THE FUEL LOAD- FOR US ROUTE THE STATE. AND SO THESE FIRE THAT HAPPENED WE FIRE PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT INTO% ABOUT THREE INCH DIAMETER WERE. TRAINING IF YOU'LL DRIVEN FIRE INDUSTRY OR TELL AREA. HERE NOW HAVE THIRTY DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; WOULD. THESE&lt;/c&gt; FIRES WHICH IS. HI WHAT PRINT THROUGHOUT THE FLIGHT CLOSING WHY EVENTS FROM THE SPY LED TO CREEK FOR. CREATED A YOU CLOUD THAT WOULD. I WASN'T INTO THE APPS. WHICH COLOR ON. PUTTING HURRICANE WIND. OUT IN EVERY DIRECTION ON THAT FIRE RATHER THAN JUST HAVING ONE WIND DRIVEN FRONT AND A WHITE IT CREATES A REALLY DYNAMIC AND DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE FIRES. QUESTION IS HOW DO WE ARRESTED THESE CASCADING CLIMATE EVENTS- FROM THE TOXIC SMOKE THAT'S COMING OUT OF THIS PROBLEM AND WE- NEED MUDSLIDES FROM HEAT DAMAGE TO OUR WATERSHED THE DAMAGED OR HABITAT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. THE DEVASTATION TO OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. AND THERE ARE REALLY THREE FRANK Q. ADDRESSING WILDFIRE RESILIENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND OFTEN I HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THESE I STAND ALONE BUT HE REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN EVERY COMMUNITY. ALL THREE OF THESE FRONTS SIMULTANEOUSLY AT DIFFERENT RATIOS FOR DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. THREE FIRE RESILIENT FRONT- EVEN THEM AS CAN CIRCLES THEY ARE ON THE INNERMOST CIRCLE IT WOULD BE HARD HOMES AND COMMUNITIES THIS IS THE WORST. YOU HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND RETROFITS ON YOUR HOME SO THAT HOMES AND COMMUNITIES CAN SURVIVE THE NEXT AREA WOULD BE THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE THIS IS WHERE WE PUT STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS AROUND IN COMMUNITIES. TO BE ABLE TO R. RANCHO WIRE AND CREATE A STATE ROUTE. FOR THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES AND SO THE STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS ARE CRUCIAL TO BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN STOP BY YOUR FROM COMING INTO A COMMUNITY AND THAT COMMUNITIES CAN ESCAPE- IF A FIRE IS COMING THROUGH. AND THE LAST AREA IT'S REALLY THE ENTIRE WILD PLANTS ENSURING THAT OUR ECOLOGIES ARE RESTORED TO THEIR NATURAL GAIL AND LEVELS OF BUYER THAT'S NEEDED SO THIS IS RESTORING FORESTED WATERSHEDS MEANING OUT- UNDERGROWTH UNDERGROWTH DOING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT- IT CHAPARRAL ECOSYSTEM. WHERE RESTORING CHAPARRAL FROM NATIVE GRASSES BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE FIRE RESILIENT THAN THE NATIVE GRASSES AND THEY NEED MASON GRASSES EXCUSE ME AND SO AN INSURING THAT WE HAD A HEALTHY LANDSCAPES THAT ARE HAVING THEIR WARM FIRE INTENSITY AND THEIR NORMAL FIRE. RETURN INTERVALS WILL REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF THE FIRES THAT WE ARE SEEING YOUR TEACHER YOUR BRAKES WILL ALLOW FIREFIGHTERS TO TAKE A STAND AND COMMUNITIES TO ESCAPE AND HARDEN HOMES WILL ALLOW COMMUNITIES TO SURVIVE IN THE WORST. CASE THAT A FIRE COMES THROUGH. THERE ARE ALSO WE COURT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE ARE LOOKING IN OF THE FROM. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE AT BESTING IN A WAVE EXTRA. AND IT SOME OF THE BAY AREA THAT HAVE BEEN IN. OUR CAPACITY TO SCALE UP BY A RESILIENT IN THE STATE. CORE PRINCIPLES AND THREE BARRIERS THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE CORE PRINCIPLES ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE REGIONAL APPROACH BECAUSE THERE REALLY ARE SOME FIRE RESILIENCE ARE GONNA REQUIRE DIFFERENT RATIOS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. BASED ON THE TOPOGRAPHY THE DENSITY OF HOMES THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING ECOLOGY AND SO WE'RE REALLY ZEROING IN ON ENSURING THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE BEING DRIVEN AND DESIGNED. BY WHAT COMMUNITIES NEED AND THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE REGIONAL DESIGN PROGRAMS AND THAT ARE GRANT CAN ACTUALLY COME INTO YOU AND DELIVER. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES A COLLECTIVE VISION THAT IS BASED ON LOCAL SCIENCE. THE OTHER PRINCIPAL WAS REALLY ENSURING THAT WE ARE BASING THIS ON ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND SCIENCE SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT. TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE HAVING- A AT THE END THAT WE ARE. UNDER AND ADAPTING THE RE. OF THE SHIPS AND CLIMATE CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW INTERESTING REQUIRE. A PREDICTIVE MODELS YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE STANDING DEAD TREES- ON THE GROUNDS AND UPDATE THOSE YOUR MODELS BUT THAT REQUIRES RESEARCH DATA ANALYTICS AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND SO THAT'S THOROUGHLY INCORPORATED. INTO THIS FUNDING AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT THE STEPS WE ARE TAKING ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE SECONDARY AN UNFORESEEN NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AND THAT WE ARE TAKING STEPS THAT ARE BUILDING UP TOWARDS FIRE RESILIENT OR THE NEXT GENERATIONS TO COME. RATHER THAN JUST THE IMMEDIATE FIRE SEASON. IN ADDITION TO BEING PRICE OR WHAT BE CLEAR AT LEAST ALL HAVE REALLY TO- AND- RESULTS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S LASTING AS WELL. WE WERE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON AND INVESTING IN. AREAS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SCALE UP MORE QUICKLY AREAS THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEN- GAS SHORTAGES THAT WE CAN PUT AN INFUSION OF RESOURCES. TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A STRONGER FOUNDATION OR SCALING UP OUR IMPACT SO THE FIRST ONE IS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE BEEN SEEING PEOPLE. COMPETING FOR THE SAME WORKERS ON THE GROUND FOR THESE PROJECTS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ACROSS THE SECTOR. THAT WE HAVE A WELL TRAINED AND FUNDED WORKFORCE READY TO DO THIS WORK AND GET OUT ON THE GROUND- ANOTHER AREA IS SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE BEEN SEEING EVEN HIRING CONTRACTORS WERE SEEING A LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. IN THIS SECTOR SO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE BUSINESSES THAT CAN STEP IN AND- AND GET. ON THE GROUND IN MORE TRADITIONAL VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS. ALSO SMALL BUSINESSES STARTING UP AROUND THE QUESTION OF WHAT DO YOU DO WITH WHAT HE BY A MASKED COMING OUT OF THE SPENDING AND FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS. INSURE THAT WE HAVE TOOLS TO TURN THAT INTO. GASIFICATION BIO DIESEL REPLACEMENT THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN INNOVATION I CAN ACTUALLY SEE BUSINESSES START UP AROUND THE SECTOR. AND THEN THE LAST AREA IS REALLY LOOKING AT PERMIT AND REGULATORY EFFICIENCIES. MOST OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE ARE DOING- IN THIS SECTOR REALLY HAVE DOUBLE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS ON TOP OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY RETURNS. THAT THEY GIVE US AND SO MOST OF THIS IS REALLY POSITIVE. FOR OUR ECOLOGY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SO THEREFORE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE DNE. THAT WISELY BUT THAT WE ARE REALLY NOT CREATING BUREAUCRATIC LOADS ON THAT SO WE'VE ALSO INVESTED IN. HEALING UP REGULATORY EFFICIENCIES SO THAT WE CAN GET PEOPLE WORKING ON THE GROUND TO RESTORE. OUR ENVIRONMENT FASTER. THE WHAT DO FOR A FEW MINUTES- WHAT WHAT'S ACTUALLY N BY AND WHERE WE- OUT OF THIS STRATEGIC FOR. OF INVESTING IN COMMUNITY HARD ST FUEL BREAKS AND ALLOW. AND THOSE. FOUNDATION AREAS I MEANT AS WELL. SO THIS BILLION DOLLAR FRAMEWORK HAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN EARLY ACTION FUNDING AND THESE GOES TOWARDS PROGRAMS THAT ARE READY TO LAUNCH NOW. AND WE'LL BY ASKING EXTRA SEASON FIRE PROTECTION SO MOST OF THESE PROJECTS TAKING HERE SOME TEACHING OKAY IF WE START IN THE SPRING. RATHER THAN IN THE FALL- AS A NORMAL BUDGET CYCLE WOULD. BY FIRE PROTECTION. IN IN THE FOLLOWING SPRING WHICH MEANS WE BUY EXTRA SEASON OF FIRE PROTECTION OUT OF THOSE DOLLARS. WANTED SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE GOING TOWARDS ACTIVITIES THAT NEED TO START NOW- AND THAT WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE STRATEGIC BARRIERS AS WELL- THE REMAINING BUDGET IS IN. BUDGET YEAR AND WE'VE ANTICIPATED PUTTING ON WE ARE REQUESTING A LONGER SPENDING WINDOW ON THOSE. THAT PROJECTS CAN REALLY GO START TO FINISH WITH THOSE DOLLARS- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE OR SEEN PROJECTS- GET FUNDED IN PHASES OFTEN MEETINGS THREE YEARS BETWEEN GRANT. TO BE ABLE TO GET THE NEXT PHASE OF THE PROJECT DONE WHICH MEANS WE END UP WITH THE PATCHWORK ASPIRES MILLIONS ON THE LANDSCAPE WHICH CAME INTO PLAY THIS FIRE SEASON. YOU KNOW SHE FIRE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A PROJECT- PUNDITS SCARED ABOUT IT CONSERVANCY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT HAD AS ONE HAD BEEN COMPLETED THE ASHY FIREBURNED AN ECOLOGICAL HEALTHY LEVEL THE STREETS ARE STANDING THE HOMES REMAINS- BUT THE AREAS THAT WORK BASED HUMAN BREAKING- WAS A CATASTROPHIC FIRE HOMES WERE LOST AND ECOLOGY. ALSO I'M DEVASTATED IN THOSE AREAS AND SO WERE REALLY ONCE YOU. PUT THESE INVESTMENTS INTO A LONGER SPENDING WINDOW TO BE ABLE TO START AND FINISH PROJECTS COMPLETELY- SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT DEEPER REQUIRE RESILIENCE. SO IT WHEN MONDAY- A FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION THAT'LL SCALE RESEARCH AREA AND WE HAVE FUNDING ACROSS STREET REMEMBER LANDSCAPE WIDELY URBAN IN AND COMMUNITY HIGH. SO YES INCLUDE ONE ACROSS OWNERSHIP BECAUSE OUR ARE NOT AND JURISTIC BOUNDS AND SO I STRESS NEED TO IN THAT LAND IS INCLUDED WE THIS YEAR SIGNED A SHARED STOREKEEPER GREEN MET WITH THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE WHO OWNS 57% OF CALIFORNIANS FORCED IN WILD LANDS AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO TREAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR- AND TO SCALE UP TO THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE HAVE ALSO MATCH THAT COMMITMENT TREATING FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR THIS IS A NUMBER THAT COMES FROM THE POOREST CARBON PLAN OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THIS BUDGET WILL ENABLE US TO BE ABLE TO REACH THAT COLLECTIVE TARGET- OR TO REACH THE STATE. I HUNDRED MILLION FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT. BY- TO TWENTY SO IT ALLOWS US RESET TO YEARS OR- AND- WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS- INVESTMENTS ACROSS LAND OWNERSHIP TYPES OF STATE ON LANDS TRIBAL FUNDING AND SMALL FAMILY LANDOWNERS AND PRIVATE LANDS. SO THE STATE OWNED LANDS THAT THE STATE OWNED ABOUT THREE MILLION ACRES WHICH IS ABOUT 3% OF. OUR LAND OWNERSHIP IN THE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET FOR STATE PARKS TO BE ABLE TO RAMP UP FROM TREATING. TWO THOUSAND ACRES HERE TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES YEAR WE HAVE A FORTY FIVE MINUTE THAT MILLION DOLLARS IDENTIFIED FOR DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. SO THEY CAN SCALE UP TO TREAT ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR THE PARTS IN QUESTION WILDLIFE BY THE WAY THIS YEAR LOST ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND ACRES. IN THE FIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THE STATE ROOMS ARE SET ASIDE BECAUSE THEY ARE RARE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOME CRITICAL HABITAT AND SO WE WANT TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY INVESTING IN A FIRE RESILIENCE ON STATE OWNED LANDS SO THAT THESE PLANTS CAN'T INDOOR AND WE ARE ALSO SETTING A HIGH STANDARD. I'M IN THE STATE ONLY CATEGORY WERE ALSO INVESTING TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS- PROPOSING TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TAHOE CONSERVANCY. THEY OWN SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED PLOTS AROUND THE TAHOE COMMUNITY AND SOME ANTI IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY AVE RESOURCES TO FULLY TREAT- THAT LANDHOLDING TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE SAFETY AND- RESILIENCE AROUND LAKE TAHOE. AND THE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE LANDS COMMISSION THOSE PLANS HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE BUT- THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ACTIVELY MANAGED AND SO THIS ALLOWS THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO BUILD A PROGRAM. THAT WILL START ACTIVELY MANAGING- OUR STATE LANDS. WE ALSO ENSURE WE'RE GIVE FUND TO TRY SOME HAVE. BEEN FUNDING AND- THROUGH- THE COR. ARE GRANT AND- WE- BUT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FEEDBACK FROM OUR TRAVEL PARTNERS AND THAT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THAT- AND THEN THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE IN TERMS OF- SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY WE HAD OUR TRAVEL PARTNERS AND SO. WE'VE IDENTIFIED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS FAIRLY FLEXIBLE BUT WE ARE ALLOWING TRIBES TO TELL US. HOW TO BE ABLE TO INVEST THESE DOLLARS IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR EQUITABLE AND JUST AND GIVES THEM TO. RESOURCES ASSEMBLY MANAGE THEIR LAN WITHOUT A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FROM THE STATE. WE ALSO ARE INCORPORATING FUNDING INCREASING FUNDING FOR SMALL FAMILY LANDOWNERS THIS IS ABOUT CALIFORNIA. AND MOST OF THESE LANDOWNERS ARE LAND RICH BUT CASH POOR AND SO WE'VE INCLUDED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FORCED TO PROVE THAT PROGRAM. WHICH GIVES GRANTS TO SMALL FAMILY LANDOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO ACTIVELY MANAGE THEIR LANDS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF THIS PROGRAM IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT MANY FAMILY LANDOWNERS. OFTEN SELL THEIR LAND BECAUSE THEY CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT SO GIVEN THE RESOURCES TO CREATE FIRE RESILIENCE AND ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE ON THIS LANDSCAPE. ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO. HELP PREVENT FAMILY LANDOWNERS FROM SELLING THEIR LAND AND HOW THEY GET CONVERTED AWAY FROM FOREST ECOLOGY. WE'RE ALSO INVEST IN- INDUSTRIAL LANDOWNER SIDE FOR THE FOREST LEGACY PROGRAM PROVIDES- FUNDING FOR LARGER LANDOWNERS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO COMMIT TO CREATE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS TO PREVENT THEIR LAND FROM GETTING CONVERTED- AND SO THIS ALLOWS US TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SUSTAINING AND RETAIN RETAINING LARGER SWATCH OF- ECOSYSTEMS IN THE STATE- AND THEN WE ALSO ARE CONTINUING ARE FORCED HEALTH GRANTS A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOREST HEALTH GRANTS- WHICH CAN THEN BE DETERMINED BY REGIONS AND COMMUNITIES APPLY FOR THOSE GRANTS AND THEY GET ON THE LANDSCAPE. AND THEN WE ARE STARTING TO SHIFT TOWARDS THIS REGIONAL- FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT REGIONS ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND THAT WE ARE THAT GIVING BLOCK GRANTS TO THE REGIONS TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE CONCENTRATIONS ARE- WHAT WE CALL THEIR PROJECT TYPE PLANS WHAT WE CALL QUOTE UNQUOTE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS- AND SO ONE OF THE FIRST REGION'S WERE ROLLING OUT WE IS THIS YOUR NEVADA CONSERVANCY THIS YEAR NOT THAT REPRESENTS- EIGHT EIGHT IT. IS HOME 260% OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER COMES FROM THIS YEAR NEVADA- AND IT IS 74% OF THIS YEAR NEVADA IS A HIGH FIRE RISK ZONE A QUARTER OF THIS YEAR ABOUT A BIRD LAST YEAR ON THE CINEMATIC CONSERVANCY HAS IDENTIFIED OVER HUNDRED SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THEY'VE DESIGNED A REGIONAL STRATEGY AND A REGIONAL PLAN THAT HAS INCORPORATED REGIONAL PARTNERS AND SO IDENTIFYING SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR NEVADA CONSERVANCY YOU START THOSE PROGRAMS. AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A LARGER COLLECTIVE IMPACT THAT WILL HELP US NOT ONLY PREVENT CATASTROPHIC FIRES BUT MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT FROM HAVING THOSE WATERSHEDS LOST- AND SO THIS IS REALLY. A CRUCIAL FUNDING AS WELL. WE'RE ALSO GOING- ST SHE FUEL BREAKS AND WE- URBAN INTERFACE- PRO. THIS INCLUDE OUR CALVET- CRUISE CAL- IS ANTICIPATED INCREASE. THEIR THEIR AND NOW OF GILBERT SAID THEY THEM LIKE. YOU ARE- FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY A YEAR DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT AND SO THIS ALLOWS THEM TO SCALE UP AND GET SOME CREWS TO DO THE JOB. THIS ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR PROXMIRE PREVENTION GRANT. AND EASY- THESE GRANTS CAN BE USED BURKE- FUEL BREAKS AND HARDENING IT'S REALLY UP TO COMMUNITIES YOU DECIDE HOW THEY USE THEM- BUT BY. WE'RE ALSO INCREASING THE WORKFORCE TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE BOTH. THESE VEGETATION THINNING PROJECTS- AND- TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A POINT AND TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR FORCED TO WORK SO WE'RE INCLUDING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FORESTRY CORP- FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA- HAND CREWS AND TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK. I AM A REALLY FOCUSED ON COMMUNITY HARDENING AND HOME HARDENING AND WE SEE HOME HARDENING- BUT WE HAVE. AN ESTIMATED TWO MILLION HOMES ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SAFE COUNCILS IN HIGH FIRE RISK ZONES THAT ARE IN NEED OF HOMES HARDENING RETROFITS AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE. TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND FIRES AND ACHIEVE THAT- HOME HARDENING LEVEL WE'VE TAKEN SOME STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE FIRE MARSHAL CHANGED. HE WOULD BE UPDATED BEAT THAT CALIFORNIA FIRE CODES YOU INCORPORATE HOME HARDENING STANDARDS AND WE SIGNED THAT AND PARADISE FOR EXAMPLE HOMES BUILT WOULD BE HIGHER UP HIGHER STANDARDS THAT ANY CLICK ON CORPORATE HOME GARDENING. A 60% PERCENT SURVIVAL RATE IN THE CAMPFIRE VERSUS THE 10% SURVIVAL RATE OF HOMES BUILT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WITHOUT THOSE STANDARDS. SO WE'RE SEEING SOME INCREASE IN SURVIVABILITY AT WITH THESE NEWER HOMES BUTIT'S REALLY. IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE RHETORIC THAT I'M HARD WE CAN H. THROUGH AND OUTREACH TO. THAT CAN AFFORD TO MAKE THESE CHANGES WE'VE INCREASED BY FOR THE- SPACE INSPECT AS YOU JUST GOT. AND WE'RE ALSO FUND FOR- OR DO YOU SEE FIVE ADVISOR WHO ARE CHRIS PARTNER. OR DOING THAT EDUCATION OUTREACH TO COME. AND WE'RE AT WE'RE LAUNCHING A PILOT PROGRAM TO BE ABLE HELP HOMEOWNERS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MAKE THESE RICHARD. RECHECK SO THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE WHICH WILL HELP US LEVERAGE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM FEMA MITIGATION GRANTS THIS WOULD BE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PILOT PROJECT TO BE ABLE TO TRULY LAUNCH- HOME HARDENING EFFORTS AND FEDERAL COMMITMENTS UNDER EIGHTY THIRTY EIGHT. SO OUR GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE WE ARE SO AS YOU CAN SEE THIS BUDGET WE ARE STEALING. AREAS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ALREADY WORKING IN ACTIVELY AND PROACTIVELY AND WE ARE LAUNCHING A PILOT FOR HOME HARDENING WHICH IS A CRUCIAL PART OF THIS- REQUIRE RESILIENCE STRATEGY- AND IT NEEDS TO START AND SO THIS IS REALLY SCALING IT UP. IN THE RIGHT WAY AND CREATING A FOUNDATION. TO SCALE FURTHER. NOW I'M- BY- COUNTY AREAS- I MET- OUR REGION SITE BASED MANAGEMENT REMOVING BARRIERS- TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESSES. AND AND PERMITTING REFORM SO THE REGIONAL PART IS REALLY CRUCIAL FOR EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS IS THE AREA THAT ALLOWS US TO TAKE. THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS ACROSS OUR FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET. AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE STRATEGICALLY MEETING THE GOALS OF THE REGION. SO THIS INCLUDES EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE REGIONAL POOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS REGION'S JUNE BRING MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE. IT PROVIDES DOLLARS FOR REGIONAL PLANNING AND PROJECT PREPARATION. AND- AND- I WINDS OF READY REGION TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT THE DOOR WE HAVE THIS BE IN. IMPACT PROGRAM ALREADY FUNDED ACTIVITIES AND REGIONAL STRATEGIES- NORTH COAST REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR EXAMPLE IT'S FUNDING AND- AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR REGIONAL ACTIVITIES BURKE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY AND DOWN IN SAN DIEGO AS WELL AND- AND IN THIS YEAR AND ABOUT AS WELL. AND SO THIS EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR NOT ONLY ALLOW US TO BUILD ON THE COLLABORATIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES- AND PLANNING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED BUT EXPERIENCE YOU FIVE NEW- SPECIFIC REGIONS INCLUDING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAKE COUNTY. WHERE YOU'RE SACRAMENTO REGION NAPA COUNTY AND SHASTA COUNTY SO THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE THEM AND ALL OF THE FIRE- PRONE REGIONS OF THE STATE COVERED BY EAST REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM OUR GRANTEES AND- AND A CONCERN WE'VE BEEN GETTING FROM REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE DOLLARS TO PLANT THAT ARE GRANT DOLLARS TEND TO GO TOWARDS AREAS. THAT AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE GRANT WRITING CAPACITY RATHER THAN THE LARGEST- FIRED NEEDS AND SO WHAT THIS IS DOING IS GIVING THEM THE TOOLS TO DESIGN A COHESIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES. AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO THEN GET PROJECTS- PIPELINE AND SHOVEL READY TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT THE DOOR- AND I'LL JUST MAKE A FEW MORE MINUTES TO GO TO THE RIGHT AND THEN I'M GOING TO BE DELIGHTED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. SO WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT THAT WAS ONE OF OUR CORE COMMITMENTS WITH THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE I'M A CORE PRINCIPLE TO OUR ENTIRE STRATEGY IS THAT WE ARE ADAPTING AND ADJUSTING TO. THE REALITIES OF SCIENCE ON THE GROUND AND CONSTANTLY STUDYING AND TRACKING- BE PRACTICES THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD AND THE STANDARDS THAT WE'RE SETTING SO IN THIS ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT IS GOING TO BE REALLY. CRUCIAL TO ACHIEVING- THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT THIRTY THIRTY. THAT MORNING SHE THAT NOT ONLY WE H. FIRE SAFETY BUT I DO SO. WE ARE DOING IT IN A WAY AND HE HAVE. THAT IS IMPROVING. AND THAT IS IN. THAT WERE. OF CALIFORNIA'S ECOLOGY AND LANDSCAPE. FOR EXAMPLE I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THIS IN ACTION- HE AG CAL FIRE PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY TO DO A STRATEGIC FUEL BREAK. UP IN COLFAX AND THIS IS A HUGE PUBLIC SAFETY TOOL. BUT THE DESIGN IN A WAY THAT BE- THAT BEING A PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT CAME ON AFTER NEEDED DEFENDING. OUT WITH HELPING CHIU GERMINATE NATIVE PLANTS INCLUDING MORNING GLORY AND MILKWEED AND SO NOW I. HAVE MONARCH BUTTERFLIES IN NEED OF BIRDS WHICH BURNING TO AN AREA THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN IN BEFORE- BECAUSE HE- ASKED FOR TEACHING FOR BREAKS WERE DESIGNED IN A WAY. THAT WAS MORE TO THE ECOLOGY THERE WERE INCLUDING FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS I'M IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST OR SPATIAL DATA ANALYTICS. SO THAT WE CAN GET ABOUT THAT WOULD GIVE US ABOUT. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF LIDAR AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS WILL CO INVEST WITH US IN THIS THIS ALLOW US TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL DOLLARS- THIS ADDED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES WOULD ALLOW US TO FILL IN THE GAPS. FOR MOST OF THE FIRE PRONE AREAS IN THE STATE. AND WE WOULD LEVERAGE OUR FEATHER FEDERAL PARTNERS TO BE ABLE TO HELP US COVER NON FIRE. PRONE AREAS AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR PREDICTIVE MODELS AND ARE PLANNING MODELS HAVE THE BEST STATE ON THE GROUNDS. WE ARE MATCHING THEIR WIN- GROUND DATA AS WELL AND- AND FUNDING FOR RESEARCH SO THAT WE ARE ENSURING THAT WE ARE DOING THE BEST TECHNIQUES ON REFORESTATION. THAT WE ARE ADAPTING TO YOUR CHAPARRAL ECOSYSTEMS CORRECTLY THAT ARE- THAT THAT WE ARE REALLY HAVING. A LONG RANGE VIEW ON THIS. FINALLY WE WANT TO SURE THAT WE ARE IN BARRIERS- WE BEEN HAVE A HARD FOR- AND COMPETING. A WORK. SO THE INCLUDES GRANT THAT OUR MILLION. IN GRANTS FOR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS THESE ARE PER. THAT WE HAVE CHIP DRAW FOR SELF PROGRAMS. AND HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE SO THESE ARE PROGRAMS LIKE HE CALIFORNIA. AND DON'T SEE I JUST KNOW THE AKRON CHIPS PROGRAM- THINK THAT IT WAS JUST SPELL. SO- THE PROGRAM AND- COUNTY AND- AND THEY ARE NOW FUNCTIONING THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN- SIERRA COUNTIES AND- AND LOCAL TRIBES EIGHT TRIBES ARE NOW INCORPORATED AND IT HELPS TRAIN THE TRIBES. IN THE BASIC VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND PRESCRIBED FIRE AND NAY THEN ARE HIRED AS THE WORK FORCE CREW OR THOSE COUNTIES. WE SAW IT PERCENT DECREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT ON THE RECTORY OF THE HONDA LEYTE TRIBE IN ALPINE COUNTY. FROM THIS PROGRAM ALONE SO THESE PROGRAMS REALLY HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT WE ALSO FUNDED PROGRAMS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THIS WORKFORCE TRAINING FUNDING WILL FOCUS ON ACTIVITIES LIKE THE CHIPS PROGRAM. COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CHURNING OUT A WORK FORCE. THAT IS CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THESE NEEDS. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN SEEN A SHORTAGE SMALL BUSINESS ARE. THE AREAS IT IS TO. A WITH MASK TO KEEP TO COME THIS WORK IT IS HOT WE ARE HAVING TO SHIP- OTHERWISE LARGER DIAMETER WOULD THAT COULD BE PUT INTO BUILDING SO TREES ARE GETTING LANDFILLED OR BURNED. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT STOMMEL CAPACITY AND WE ARE OPEN PILE BURNING- MILLIONS OF TONS OF SLASH PILES BECAUSE THERE IS NOT- THERE ARE NOT THAT GREAT. I RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TO TAKE THOSE. NON MARKETABLE PRODUCTS AND TURN IT INTO- HIGHER INTO BETTER PRODUCTS SUCH AS- DIESEL GAS REPLACEMENTS OR BUILDING MATERIAL AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION IN THE SECTOR. AND A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE ONE OF THE BARRIERS HAS BEEN ATTRACTING PEOPLE TO THE CALIFORNIA MARKET AND ANOTHER VERY ACTOR HAS BEEN GETTING PEOPLE ACCESS TO. CAPITAL LOWERS CAPITAL I'M PEOPLE. TO CREATE. HE WANTS IN THE FORESTRY SECTOR QUITE. OF TENSION 4% WILL INTORATES ON THE LOANS SO THE CLIMATE WAS ONE THAT WERE PROPOSED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. YOU ARE LARGE THIS WHAT S. WHAT INTEREST LENDING- AND ZERO INTO LENDING BE ABLE TO CREATE- CAPITAL AND SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE FORESTRY SECTOR SO EVERYTHING FROM WHAT INNOVATION- AND WOODY BIOMASS INNOVATION TO MORE TRADITIONAL MARKETS. TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW US TO SCALE UP STRATEGICALLY THIS IS ALSO PROPOSING THREE MILLION DOLLARS- OR- PR AND OR- THAT GO BASED TO BE ABLE TO DO YOU WORK TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO ATTRACT. LARGER BUSINESSES LIKE CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER INDUSTRY- CHIU CALIFORNIA AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER IS- COMPRESSED. SMALLER DIAMETER WOULD THAT ADD THAT REPLACED A STEEL AND CONCRETE IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION ON CALIFORNIA JUST UPDATED OUR BUILDING CODES TO ALLOW UP TO EIGHTEEN STORIES. IN CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER. BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA THEY CALL THEM PLACE SCRAPERS SO- WE NOW HAVE THAT HE AT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT THESE BUSINESS SAYS. SO HAVING SOMEONE FULL TIME AND GO BASS FOCUSED ON BRINGING LARGER SCALE BUSINESSES Q. CALIFORNIA TO HELP UTILIZED THE PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF THE FOREST AND VEGETATION THINNING PROJECTS. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THAT THOSE PROJECT THOSE. ARE PROJECTS DON'T JUST END UP ON AS SMOKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. SO THE LAST AREA AND. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. AND WITH ME AS WE GOTTEN THROUGH THIS REALLY LOOKING- PERMITTING REFORM AS WELL. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT DO TO BE A TO SCALE THESE AND- ONLY THE PROJECTS IN YEARS OF IN. REVIEW YOUR OVER. AND SO WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING STREAMLINING OVERSIGHT AND CAL. THIS YEAR WE LAUNCHED THE CAL B. T. WERE IS TWENTY MILLION- THREE INQUIRE REVIEW ON HIGH FIRE RISK NOT. AREAS IN THE STATE SO THAT MOST OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE FUNDING- WOULD BE TO GET THEIR SEQUEL AND NOW IS THIS ROUTE THE QALBI TP PROCESS. WHAT THIS DOES IS IT TAKES EQUAL TIMELINE FROM. YEARS TO A COUPLE MONTHS AND- AND WE ARE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE COLLABORATION FROM OUR OTHER PARTNERS WHO ARE ALSO HAVE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. IN THE LANDSCAPE SECTOR INCLUDING WATER BOARDS AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE INCORPORATED. THERE STANDARDS INTO THE CAL BTP. ANYONE DOING A PROJECT UNDER THE COUNTY D. P. HAS THE MITIGATION TOOLS TO AVOID THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT COULD TRIGGER HE- DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE- PERMITS. THAT NO SPECIES TAKE A TAX PEOPLE THROUGH HOW TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CALIFORNIA WATER BOARD HAS BEEN REALLY INNOVATIVE IN PARTNERING WITH US. THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED A STATEWIDE WATER PERMIT TO COMPLEMENT THE BTP AND ARE UTILIZING THE BTP ASK- THE ENTRY POINT FOR THAT PERMIT. AND WE ARE ARE PROVIDING TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET FOR THE WATER WORKS TO BE ABLE TO STACK. SO THAT THAT PERMIT IS FREE AND SO ESSENTIALLY THE COUNTY T. P. WILL BE NOW A ONE STOP PERMITTING SHOT- FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDERGOING THESE ACTIVITIES AND IT'S REALLY A GOOD MODEL. CUTTING RETAIN AND EFFICIENCY AND THEN FINALLY ON. THIS PERMITTING EFFICIENCY POINT EIGHT WE ARE- INC. ADD TO MY DOLLAR FOR THE BOY FORCE. TO BE TO HELP ROLE OUT THE- PROJECTS BUT AND NOW. OF COUNTY TPP. BE ONE THE CALDERON THIS. THIS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT- RECEIVED LOT OF TIME ON THIS TIME. IT IS A THOUSAND PAGE DOT THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE GRANT YOU ARE. SO THIS DIRE IS IT ALLOWS HUGE YOU PROJECTS. IN OUR ON A FORTY YEAR SO DIFFERENT PROJECTS MANY OF WILL BE- THESE GRANTEES ARE FUN- THROUGHOUT THREE JUST A PROPOSAL. AND IT WILL ALLOW US TO THEN HAVE A PROJECTS. ANALYSIS TEMPLATE- IN IN ANY OF THESE. HE GOES ON OR BUY OR VEGETATION TYPES SO THAT WHEN IN THE NEXT RANDY COMES ALONG OUR TO DO A PROJECT THEY WILL KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO HANDLE A CALIFORNIA CHAPARRAL ECOSYSTEM- THAT NEED MEDICATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED IN THE V. T. P. O. R. ANY PRE IDENTIFIED FOR THEM. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS IDENTIFY WHAT SPECIES ARE ON THE GROUND AND- AND THEY'LL HAVE A MUCH SIMPLER. FORMAT TO USE SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE TAKE A REALLY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH HERE YOU ARE LISTENING YOU ARE PARTNERS ON THE GROUND LISTENING TO COMMUNITIES AND REGIONS. AND ADJUSTING OUR PROGRAM AND OUR FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT NOT ONLY A SIGNIFICANT SCALE OUT IN OUR PIECE OF FIRE RESILIENCE. BUT ALSO ADDRESSING THESE UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT COULD BE POTENTIAL HURDLES AND SLOW DOWN PROGRESS AS WE SCALE OUT. SO WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND YOUR LEADERSHIP. IN THIS EFFORT AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS DON'T GO ANYWHERE LET'S HEAR FROM THE ALEJO FIRST AND THEN WE'LL. GO TO THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. HELLO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BRIAN BROWN AGAIN WITHOUT A. L. I TO MAKE THAT ARE OFF DID PUBLISHED REPORTS INTEREST. TO THE WELL RESILIENCE PACKAGE OTHER AVAILABLE OUR WEB. AS WELL AS BELIEVE THEY'RE LAY ON THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE. I'M GONNA SPEAK MOSTLY TO THE FIRST DOCUMENT WHICH IS KIND OF OUR OVER ARCHING COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE BUT THE SECOND DOCUMENT HOPEFULLY WILL BE HELPFUL TO THE COMMITTEE AS WELL WHICH HAS. A MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON EACH OF THE TWO DOZEN OR SO PROGRAMS THAT ARE PART OF THE RESILIENCE PACKAGE- AND LET ME ALSO PREFACE MY REMARKS BY SAYINGTHAT- THESE ARE OUR OFFICES INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE- WITH THE XCELERATED TIMELINES- FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS AND THEN JUST. THE SCALE OF THIS PROPOSAL WE'VE HAD- SOME GOOD INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN THE MINISTRATION- BUT SURELY THERE ARE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT I THINK WE'VE ASKED THAT- AND I'M SURE THEY'RE GONNA BE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE- THAT YOU'LL WANT ANSWERS TO AND SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- IN THE COMMITTEE OF COURSE- TO. EXIST PROPOSAL PROGRESSION. THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. SO WITHOUT A FEW. KEY HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS FOR YOU FIRST OF ALL. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS PACKAGE- HAS A LOT. OF AMERICANS THAT THE FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND MITIGATION. IT WE THINK IT'S VERY MERITED- THAT GIVEN NOT ONLY THE SEVEREST OF BUYERS LAST YEAR THE LAST THREE OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE BEEN AMONG THE WORST IN. RECORDED HISTORY IN THE LAST TWO DECADES HAVE BEEN A- SOME OF THE WORST DECADE FOR- FIRE DAMAGE. IN RECORDED HISTORY IN THE STATE SO WE THINK THIS ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON PREVENTION MITIGATION MAKES SENSE BUILT ON. THE EFFORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN SB NINE ALIGN. EVERYTHING ALSO HAVING. A VARIED MIX OF STRATEGIES MAKES A LOT OF SENSE- YOU HEARD MISS MORRIS TALK ABOUT THE WIDER RANGE OF. RISKS INVOLVED AND SO WE THINK HAVING A- HAVING THESE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT ARE TARGETED SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENT RISKS- MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. THAT SAID IT WOULD CERTAINLY THIS PACKAGE IS NOT THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD STRUCTURE OF. RESILIENCE PACKAGE AND SO WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. AS YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. ONE IS THAT NOTING THAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE PACKAGE WILL BE FUNDED FROM GENERAL FUND. AND IT'S ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SPENDING. FIVE NOW YOU HEARD ME MENTION EARLIER SOME CONCERNS AT OUR OFFICE IN FINANCIAL PROJECTED MULTI YEAR BUDGET DEFICIT FOR THE GENERAL FUND IN THE FUTURE SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSING A ONE TIME SPENDING. GIVEN WITHOUT YOUR FISCAL CONCERNS. BUT OF COURSE THIS IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE WILDFIRE PROBLEM IS NOT A ONE TIME PROBLEM IN THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. IS SO LARGE IS IT NOT CAN BE ADDRESSED. BY THIS PACKAGE ALONE. INTO THAT SIMPLY TO SUGGEST THAT THE COMMITTEE. IN THE LEGISLATURE WE THINK WE'LL WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK ABOUT WHAT A LONGER TERM STRATEGY IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF THIS MAY BE THE FIRST STEP OR SOME. SOME PACKAGE- APPROVE THIS YEAR COULD BE A FIRST STEP BUT- WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT WHAT BEYOND THIS BOTH PROGRAMMATIC LEE. AS WELL AS HOW IT WOULD BE FUNDED- THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE- ACTION. SO ABOUT ONE. OF THE FOR. PROPOSED IN THIS PACKAGE WOULD IS PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR- WE HAVE KIND OF A MIXED REACTION TO THIS SO. IN GENERAL OFFICE A LITTLE BIT WARY ABOUT A FUNNY EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS- WITHOUT STRONG JUSTIFICATION FROM THE MINISTRATION OF PARTLY. BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE THE FULL. BUDGET SPRING BUDGET CYCLE TO DELIBERATE ON EACH OF THE PROPOSALS I MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING EMPLOYED BY A PROPOSAL HOW WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. IF IT GRANT PROGRAMS WHAT CRITERIA WOULD BE USED HOW DOLLARS BE ALLOCATED ACROSS THE STATE IN IN. IN PARTICULAR THIS MANY. PROGRAMS THAT THERE'S ALL THERE THERE'S A LOT TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND AND SO- BUT THE OTHER ISSUE TOO IS TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU APPROPRIATE THOSE FINES. EARLY THAT TAKES THEM OFF THE TABLE. AS YOU'RE DELIBERATING ON YOUR FULL TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PLAN. AND WE KNOW THERE A LOT OF PRESSURES ON. ON ON THE ON THE GENERAL FUND IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE BUDGET AS WELL. THAT SAID WE DO THINK THERE A COUPLE AREAS WHERE EARLY ACTION. COULD REALLY BE WARRANTED ONE IS WITH RESPECT TO THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSED FROM G. G. R. AFTER. IN THE CURRENT YEAR- IN AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO APPROVE A- CURRENT YEAR. AUGMENTATION TO THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN BUT WE WOULD KNOW THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. ADDED TO THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ALREADY APPROVED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET. WOULD BRING TOTAL FUNDING FOR FORESTRY AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION. WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE- DIRECTION IN SB NINE OH ONE SO WE THINK THERE'S- IF THAT OULD BE REASONABLE. THE OTHER THING TOO THAT MS MORE TALK ABOUT WAS THAT- SOME OF THAT EARLY ACTION. COULD ALLOW PROJECTS TO BE IN PLACE IN ADVANCE OF ANOTHER FIRE SEASON WHETHER THAT. IN SOME CASES THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIRE SEASON OR IN SOME CASES THE IT REALLY. TRYING TO GET PROJECT TEMPLATE EVEN BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO FIRE SEASON. EVERYTHING IN EITHER CASE THAT COULD REALLY BE WORN DID BUY THAT ACTUALLY. OF PUBLIC SAFETY- PROTECT FOR. WHERE THEY HAVE CONSIDER WE WOULD SIMPLY NOTE THAT- FOR ANY OF THOSE CASES- WE'D- SUGGEST THAT THE- COMMITTEE HAVE THE INVESTIGATION PROVIDE DETAILED TIMELINES AND- IMPLEMENTATION PLANS DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT WOULD. IN FACT BE THE CASE. BUT MY NEXT COMMENT IS- IN THINKING ABOUT THE- PACKAGE OF PROGRAMS- CERTAINLY AS I MENTIONED THIS IS A WORTHWHILE PACKAGE TO LOOK AT BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER AND WE DON'T HAVE ESTERLY AND ALTERNATIVE- PROPOSAL TO PUT IN FRONT OF YOU BUT WE DO THINK USING THE SPRING PROCESS TO IDENTIFY OTHER OPTION BOTH PROGRAMMATIC AND FUNDING- IT IS MERITED SO FOR EXAMPLE THE- PACKAGE RELIES MOSTLY ON EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVELY BUT PRIMARILY EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS AND SO MAYBE WORTH USING THE SPRING PROCESS TO GET INPUT FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE. A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES FOR LAND USE PLANNING FOR LOCAL TO SPACE AND FOR LOCAL HAS FUEL REDUCTION PER GETTING INPUT FROM ALL THE STAKE TO SEE WHAT OTHER IDEAS ARE MIGHT BE- THAT YOU COULD EITHER- AUGMENT DE PLAN OR- FIND IN PLACE OF SOME OF THE- I AM IN WE THINK- IT INTO THINK ABOUT A LONGER TERM ON AS A WITH THE GENERAL BEING TIME IN NATURE WE THINK IS IT WORTH ENGAGING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON WHAT ARE SOME. LONGER TERM FINDING. POSSIBILITY TO FIND OUT SOME YOUR PRIOR ACTIVE. ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND SO I JUST AS EXAMPLES- THE OPERATION HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP ALREADY TODAY IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS- I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN PLACE WITH GIGI R. F. THAT IS SOMETHING THOUGH IF THEY HISTORICALLY WAS USED TO FIND PREVENTION AND MITIGATION. pOFFICE HAS RECOMMENDED IT IS THE- IS HAVING WATER AGENCIES BY FINDING WAYS TO GET THEM- TO INVEST MORE IN FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS IN PRIORITY WATERSHEDS SO- SO. THERE'S A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES BUT THERE MAY BE A BROADER ARRAY OF. ADDITIONAL ONGOING STRATEGIES. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO INVESTIGATE. SO OFTEN WAY- AS I SAID YOU COULD CONSIDER THIS PACKAGE YOU CAN CONSIDER MODIFYING THE PACKAGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS- IN IN IN THE IN THE PROBABLY KNOW RIGHT MIX OF PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN OFFER YOU I THINK IDEALLY. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE RESEARCH LITERATURE AND TELL YOU WELL HERE THE DIFFERENT MIX OF PROGRAMS AND HERE'S THE- COST EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH ONE- AND WHILE WE'RE THERE CERTAINLY IS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THAT MANY OF THE STRATEGIES ARE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING WILDFIRE RISK- WHETHER THAT- FOR SPENDING ACTIVITY DEFENSIBLE SPACE HOME HARDENING- FUEL BREAKS ALL THOSE. I THINK THERE IS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE WHEN IMPLEMENTED WELL AND- THE RIGHT PLACES- IT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL TO TELL YOU WHAT WHICH ONE OF THOSE BY EACH YEAR A DOLLAR SPENT ON ONE. BUYS YOU MORE PUBLIC SAFETY OR OTHER BENEFITS THAT YOU MIGHT CARE ABOUT RELIGION TO OTHERS. I'M KIND OF COMPLICATING THIS TOO IS THAT THERE ARE A FEW SEVERAL THESE PROGRAMS WERE I THINK WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE MINISTRATION ON. THE JACKET IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND ARE PROJECTED OUTCOMES FROM THE PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE THAT FOR SOME OF THE FOR OVER SOME OF THE PROGRAM BUT NOT OTHERS. AND SO. IN COMBINATION I IS THE- WE THINK YOU'RE GOING TO- HAVE TO- THEY HAVE TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO BALANCE WHAT YOU THINK IS THE RIGHT MIX OF PROGRAM BASED ON YOUR PRIORITIES AND SO THAT MAY FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT OTHER FACTORS LIKE HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE DIFFERENT BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH ONE SET OF PROGRAM FIRST AND ANOTHER SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN BUT THE- SOMEWHAT MORE THAN HALF THE MONEY. PROPOSED TOWARDS- FORCED HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND LANDSCAPE- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT PER SE BUT- BY COMPARISON BUT THE MUCH SMALLER EMPHASIS ON COMMUNITY HARD MINUTES SO YOU'LL WANT TO THINK ABOUT EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT SETS OF ACTIVITIES COMES WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF BENEFITS AND SO YOU'LL WANT. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR- PRIORITIES ARE. ASHLEY WHATEVER PILOT PACKAGE YOU DO ADOPTED ANY. WE SUGGESTED THE IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE REPORTING MEASURES AND THIS IS PARTLY TO. HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR DELIVERING- WHATEVER OUTCOMES IT IS SAYS IT'LL BE ABLE TO DELIVER IT WITH THE FUNDING AND JUST GIVEN THE- MAGNITUDE OF FUNDING REQUESTED WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT EVEN PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT AND THAT IS IF WE HAVE GOOD REPORTING METRICS IN PLACE THAT CAN HELP INFORM FUTURE DECISION MAKING. BOTH HOW TO- HOW TO PRIORITIZE FUTURE- PROGRAMS HOW TO HOW TO TARGET DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN LEARN. EVEN MORE ABOUT WHERE WE CAN BE WHERE PROJECTS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE- IN ALSO HELP. INFORM FUTURE- BUDGET DECISIONS YOU MIGHT. YOU MIGHT HAVE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT I'M LIKE I DO WANT TO FOLLOW ON THE L. A. O.'S. A COMMENT ABOUT THE- LOCALS- THE- WORK I KNOW AND I'M PART OF ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHERE THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK THEY MONITOR THEY MANAGE SOME OF THE- THE STATE PARK STATE. THEY'RE THEY'RE NEEDING FUNDS TO DO FEEL MANAGEMENT. GET THE PERMIT FROM THE AIRPORT BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE WILL GET WITH DEAL WITH HOPEFULLY TO STREAMLINED BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHERE WE ARE WITH ALL THESE LOCAL PARTNERS THAT MAY BE LOOKING. FOR SEVEN CASH FOR THEIR PROJECTS THAT ARE READY I KNOW. I'M NOT TO I KNOW THAT THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE IN ALPINE COUNTY IN A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN SIERRA COUNTY WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THEIR TRIBE TO GET THEIR PROJECTS THAT I'M FAMILIAR THANKS TO A TECH LETTING US KNOW BUT THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER. REGIONAL PARKS OR COUNTY PARKS AT A ROUTE THAT I. TEND TO OUR LAN- FAR FIRE LAND WHAT IT WHETHER THEY- WHAT DO THEY NEED. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SENATOR AND- AND WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING DOLLARS DOWN TWO REGIONS ARE. A REGIONAL FORCE TO FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO BRING ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING. LOCAL PARKS AND LOCAL LANDOWNERS TO THE TABLE WE PARTNER EXTENSIVELY WAVES THE LANDSCAPE STEWARDSHIP NETWORK WHICH REPRESENTS MOST OF THESE- LOCAL PARKS. TO HELP US- AND HAVE INCORPORATED FEEDBACK FROM THEM ABOUT. OUR PROJECT- AND PROGRAM DESIGN ON THIS TO BE ABLE TO HELP- LEFT UP LOCAL LANDOWNERS- AND LOCAL LAND MANAGERS I'M IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY. AND SO- SO THIS BUDGET INCLUDES- FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN. REGIONAL AND I'VE% FORCED HEALTH GRANTS WHICH YOU KNOW IT WAS FORCED TO SORT OF THE GENERIC TERM WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. BUDGET IT REALLY CAN INCORPORATE GRASSLANDS AND RANGELANDS AND ROLAND OAK WOODLANDS AND PINE FORESTS AND CHAPARRAL. AND IT DOES IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED ACROSS BECAUSE OWNS. SO SO ABSOLUTELY WE'RE- PARTNERING WITH LOCAL PARTNERS AND- AND THEY ARE PART OF THESE COLLABORATIONS. AND ONE OF THE GOALS OF ENSURING THAT WE HAVE- REGIONAL PLANNING DOLLARS IS THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY STRATEGIES FOR EACH OF THESE LANDOWNERS. THAT YOU HAVE A STRATEGY ACROSS AN ENTIRE WATERSHED. YOU BRING ALL THE LANDOWNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE. TO HELP DESIGN- AND THAT- AND VISION FOR THE REGION. WHITE I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERY MEMBER OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE BUT SINCE WE PUT REGIONAL PLANNING DOLLARS IN THE LAST THREE BUDGETS AND NOW. THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMING FORWARD TO PROGRAM IT WARMS ALL OUR HEARTS TO SEE THAT MONEY IN THERE. WE'LL LOOK. AT THAT THAT PHILOSOPHICALLY. YOU GOT ONE TIME PRO PRIVATE. ARE PROGRAM HERE AT THE L. A. OF HIS TALK ABOUT A LONG TERM. AND WE'RE COMBINING GENERAL FUND MONIES WHAT. GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY SOMEONE THE THINGS WE'VE THE BELLY OF THIS POINT OUT IS THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY. ARE CONTINUING. FIVE A SOURCES OF FUNDS THAT WE CAN DO THAT CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND IN REDUCING THE CARBON IN OUR ENVIRONMENT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS EACH YEAR WE SEE WE SCRUB THEM. SO SOME OF THOSE. PROGRAMS WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEM WE KNOW WE'RE ADVOCATE SIR WE'VE GOT DATA ON IT THAT WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM. PROBLEM OF TAKING THIS BILLION DOLLARS ANDUSING ALL GENERAL FUNDS TO DO THAT. AND ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK SO YOU HAVE THIS IN FUSION OF MONEY THAT GOES IN THERE TO ADDRESS. THE FOREST LANDSCAPES BUT THEN IN THE OUT YEARS WITH THE FUNDS THAT WE HEAR FROM CAP AND TRADETHEN WE CONTINUE IT'S NOT ONE AND DONE WE CONTINUE TO FUND THAT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT PHILOSOPHY. WE DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE HAD SAID BERMAN FINANCE. YOU WORRY STEVEN BENSON DEPARTMENT OF. ONE IS THAT IT. THIS ORDER AT EIGHT SO I THINK. OF OUR PROPOSAL DOES STRIKE TRENDS SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT CAN HIGHLIGHT THAT WHILE THE G. G. R. WELL THE GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS ARE BEING PROVIDED IN A ONE TIME BASIS THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDED NO WAY THAT IT MAKES THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS WHICH IS KIND OF A TYPICAL BUDGET WINDOW THAT WE INVEST IN AND ALLOWS FOR THESE PROJECTS TO KIND OF- TO START AND IT ALWAYS TO COMPLETION PROVIDE THEIR- BENEFITS THAT WAY. AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF ME LIKE ALL BUDGETS BUT IT'S A BALANCING ACT OF TRYING TO TAKE WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES TO INVEST. AND THE NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS PARTICULAR. GOVERNOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S AVAILABLE IS. LARGELY ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INTO OUR OUR PERSPECTIVE ON IT WAS IF WE- INVEST THIS IN ONE HUNDRED OFTEN WE HAVE NOW BUT PROVIDED IN THE WAY THAT IT HAS AN AMOUNT AND AVAILABILITY. THAT LETS THESE PROJECTS YOU TAKE PLACE OVER FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO IT STILL GIVES US. THE SAME KIND OF BENEFITS IS IF WE DID SMALLER INVESTMENTS- EACH YEAR BUT THE THING AND THEN I ALSO JUST WANNA. FINANCING SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT THAT. THE G. WHAT PART OF THE PUZZLE IS MAKING THE- SB NINE OH ONE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REDUCTION FUND. INVESTMENT FOR THE NATIONAL FIVE YEARS THAT'S KIND OF AN ONGOING COMPONENT AS WELL. AND I THINK WELL NOT PART OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE JUST TALKED ABOUT CAN THE THAT CALIFORNIA AND CCC CREW- PROPOSAL WHICH IS REALLY PART OF. THE ADMINISTRATION'S OVERALL STRATEGY AND I THINK FITS IN THIS CALL WILDLIFE. MANAGEMENT WILDLIFE RESILIENCY. POLICY AREA BECAUSE YOU KNOW AND THAT'S ALSO AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS I THINK THAT REALLY WHEN. YOU WHEN YOU STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE VERY. HOLES TOGETHER THERE'S A SIGN OF TRYING BALANCE. BOTH ONGOING AND ONE TIME TO KIND OF HIT ON ALL OF THOSE AND MORE FOR. WAYS THAT IS MORRIS TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL ISSUE. MISTER BENSON WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT ADDRESSES. I KNOW YOU WERE THERE DURING OUR CONVERSATIONS- THE OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. CREATED THE FOR THE DAY A COMMITMENT TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE S. B. NINE OH ONE DECIDED TO DO A FOR FIVE YEARS SO WE'RE- WE'RE- WE'RE PART OF THE ARCHITECTURE THAT SAID THAT THIS IS WHAT. THIS IS OUR- OUR GOALS BECAUSE- THE- POINT AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS JUST IS SAID IF WE GET THIS INFUSION. WE HAVE LOTS OF PROGRAMS TO REDUCE CARBON. THIS IS WHAT THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUND THIS IS THE FIRE PORTION IS A PORTION OF IT. AND WE REALIZE THAT WE'VE GOT A LONG TERM COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE TO DO SO. I JUST RESET. I GOT A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUR FROM OUR VICE CHAIR. CENTER DOLLY FIRST AND SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO DO- FOR I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT. SO I'VE BEEN HERE EIGHT YEARS. AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT FIRE BEFORE WE HAD THE GIANT FIRES. AND I'M ALSO SOMEBODY WHO LIVES IN THE FOREST AND I OWN FOR CIVILIANS AND I ALSO SEE MY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE- THE ONLY TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEN AND I WANNA TALK ABOUT LONG TERM HOW WE REALLY SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THERE'S- PIECES OF IT IN. IN JESSICA OR MISS MORRIS'S- THE PRESENTATION THAT I REALLY LIKE BUT YOUR- FIRST OF ALL NUMBER ONE. WE HAVE THE REASON YOU DON'T SEE PRIVATE INVESTMENT WHICH IS WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED. SO WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE TO TAKE ALL THESE PRODUCTS TO THERE'S VALUE IN SOME OF THE INS IN MOST OF THE STUFF THERE IS SOME VALUE. BUT IT DEPENDS ON. HOW FAR YOU ARE FROM. THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MAKE IT WORK. SO WE NEED TO PLACE INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THE AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE A LONG TERM COMMITMENT. PRIVATE MONEY WILL COME IN AND PRIVATE BUSINESS PEOPLE WILL COME IN. AND BUILD FACILITIES. WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPLY US WITH CROSS LAMINATED. WOOD PELLETS ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT THEY CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT. THE REASON YOU DON'T GET RETURNS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A LONG TERM SUPPLY. YOU HAVE SHORT TERM SUPPLY YOU HAVE WE'RE GONNA DO THIS PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WE WE'RE GONNA CHECK THIS STUFF OUT. AND WE VOTE ON THE GROUND NOW BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HOLD THREE HUNDRED MILES TO FACILITY DOESN'T WORK DOESN'T PAY COSTA. THE COST IS A- WE NEED TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I KEEP GOING BACK TO THIS INTEL WE- GET STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTS. REAL ONES THAT ALLOW US TO DO TWENTY YEARS SO SOMEBODY WILL COME AND INVEST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A PLAN. SO THEY CAN READ SO THEY CAN PAY OFF THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE OF A LONG TERM SUPPLY. I FOR THE LIFE OF ME I SIT ON EQ. I SAID I SAID ON- WHAT PART OF MY LIFE IN THIS IN THE AND I HEAR I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY BILLS I'VE HEARD WERE OUR GONNA SAVE. I MEAN WITH A SENATOR WIENER JUST HAD A BARE SPOT BERANI WE KILLED MORE WILDLIFE IN FOUR MILLION ACRES OF WILDFIRES YOU WILL EVER DO HUNTING OR- FISHING OR WHATEVER AND WE WE'VE GROWN MORE HABITAT. IN THIS STATE. THAT IS DESTROYING THE WATER SAYS THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE URBAN AREAS NEED TO DRINK AND WE NEED FOR FARMS SO IT'S EMOTIONAL. IT'S FRUSTRATING. IN OUR I'M I'M NOT BEATING ANYBODY UP HERE BUT I'M WE ARE WE ARE DOING IT THE WRONG WAY INTEL WE- LOOK AT LONG TERM. IF A STRUCTURE IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE SPINNING OUR WHEELS WE'RE GONNA SPEND MONEY AND WE I AGREE WITH MIKE. MY COLLEAGUE WAS REQUIRED THAT WE NEED TO ATTACK THE FIRE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE VEGETATION. OF BTP VEGETATION ARMOR STANDS FOR- VEGETATION TREATMENT PLANT. WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE NEED BILL GIVES OF A STRUCTURE HERE AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LONG TERM PLAN IF WE DON'T DO THAT. I DON'T CARE. I GOT FOUR MORE YEARS AND I TELL YOU IN FORMER YEARS WILL BE SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING WILL BE. WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A DOWNTURN IN THE BUDGET WE DID BLESSED. IN EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD MONEY TO SPEND. SO I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH I KNOW MISS MORRIS AND I PERSONALLY KNOW HER I KNOW SHE'S VERY WICKED SMART IN THIS AREA I MEAN WE NEED TO SIT DOWN AS A AS A AS BIPARTISAN GROUP AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE GO TO WASHINGTON AND WE GET THOSE GUYS BACK THERE TO PARTNER WITH US ON OUR ON OUR HABITAT OR WITH A WALL IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING TO WATCH THIS WHOLE THING HAPPENED SO. WE NEED TO TALK TO BUSINESS PEOPLE NOT NOT GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CREATE JOBS A CURATE GOVERNMENT JOBS NOT PRIVATE ISSUE JOBS WHICH WE NEED AND THEN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE A PROJECT HERE AND THEN ONE THREE MILES AWAY AND EXPECT SOMEBODY BILL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SOMEWHERE. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SO I JUST WANT TO VENT BECAUSE I'M SO FRUSTRATED. AND IT'S NOT A LACK OF MONEY THERE'S TWENTY MINUTES IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS IT'S PART OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YES STREAMLINING PERMITTING PROCESSES. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT AIR QUALITY WE DID SB NINE ONE AND I EXTENDED THAT WE EXTENDED US TOGETHER. THE CONTRACTS ON BUY MISMAS AND ENVIRONMENT GROUPS ARE SCREAMING OUT UNTIL YOU WE MADE IT MORE CARBON IN THE LAST YEAR THAN WILL EVER. ADMIT IN IN IN IN A BIOMASS PLANT SO IT'S LIKE COMMONSENSE I'M A FARMER. I PLOW IN. MY LAN BEFORE HER PLANET BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU DON'T GET A RETURN ON IT THIS NO DIFFERENT THAN HERE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THINGS. IN A COMMON SENSE APPROACH. AND THEN. PUT IT TO WORK ON THE GROUND I OFTEN. FEEL LIKE I'M JUST. BEYOND FRUSTRATED AND I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT AND I WANT TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA FOR A WATERSHED INNER. CRITTERS AND EVERY EVERYTHING TO WORK LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO WE HAVE A HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION THAT'S BECAUSE OF FROM ANY OF CLIMATE CHANGE. TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING. THE ONE THING WE CAN CONTROL. THERE'S ONE THING WE CAN'T CONTROL OXYGEN WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A FIRE AND SPARK BUT WE CAN CONTROL THE FUEL. THAT'S THE ONE THING WE CAN DO. WE NEED TO DO THAT. SORRY CHOIR MEMBERS THANK. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER JENNER QUESTIONER YES ABSOLUTELY JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MISS MORSE AND TICKET CRAWFORD FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THE TWENTY MILLION- FOR THE- PARTICIPATION WITH TRIBES AT THIS IS BEEN A TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IN THE MAKING VERY GRATEFUL THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ENGAGING ON THAT. ISSUE ON I HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD MY UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE MR CHANG AND MR EDWARDS ON THE LINE. HI THIS IS AJ. DON'T MISS CHANG I APOLOGIZE. I DO MATCHING IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU MORNING IT'S GOOD TO ZERO SORRY THAT WE CAN'T BE THERE WITH YOU I'M WITH YOU- IT TOO MUCH OF TWENTY TWENTY IS BLIGHTED TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THERE WE GO- HE- IS SOME QUICK QUESTIONS. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE. THE PRESCRIBED BURNING APPROVAL PROCESS. IN RIGHT NOW- THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS BASED OFF OF INDIVIDUAL AIR DISTRICTS IN THEIR BOARDS. IN APPROVAL THOSE PERMITS BOTH WITH THEIR LOCAL STAFF AS WELL AS THE BOARD'S- IN SO I HAVE SOME VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- THREE QUICK ONES. HOW MANY DAYS THIS WINTER HAS A CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD CERTIFIED THAT IT'S BAD AT THE IT IS SAFE TO BURN ACROSS THIS YEAR AS- AND- AND- COASTAL RANGE. DO YOU HAVE THAT OF TOP YOUR HEAD SO I PROBABLY GONNA TAKE A ESTIMATE ON THIS PLEASE BUT I'M GENERALLY FROM ABOUT NOVEMBER TO JULY. ABOUT 97% OF THE DAYS OUR BIRTHDAYS. SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF DAYS ARE CONSIDERED FOR DAYS AND THEN IT JUST I THINK- SENATOR YOU KNOW THIS BUT JUST YOU KNOW FOR KIND OF THAT EDUCATION OF OTHERS. HAVE A TWO PHASE PROCESS- CARD DOES BURN CALLS IF THEY WE HAVE A TEAM OF METEOROLOGISTS THAT ARE AT. THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING THEY WORK TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND THEY MAKE A BIRD CALLS EVERY DAY AND THEN AS YOU NOTED THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS SO LOCAL AND AGENCIES THAT HAVE SORT OF MORE. ON THE GROUND INFORMATION THEY'RE CLOSER TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THEIR LOCAL AREAS ARE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY. AUTHORIZED THE BIRDS. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT NOT. THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ACRES HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH PRESCRIBED BURNS IN THE LAST YEAR IN OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. SO AND THERE'S THIS IS DATA SAID THAT AND SOME OF IT IS REPORTED INTO A SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS CALLED PEEPERS WHICH I'M NOT EVEN GONNA TRY TO REMEMBER WHAT THE ACRONYM STANDS FOR. SO AND LET ME SEE IF I ACTUALLY. I OF COURSE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AT THE TOUCH THE TIP OF MY- AND- I THINK THEY MAY HAVE IT. BUT. THAT WE HAVE THAT DISTRICTS CAN USE AND LAND MANAGERS CAN USE TO KIND OF START THE BURN APPLICATION PROCESS THAT WAS KIND OF A WAY TO STANDARDIZE THAT PROCESS- THE FUNDING THAT IS IN THIS- BUDGET REQUEST ACTUALLY WILL HELP US CONTINUE A PROGRAM WHERE WE DO TRAINING AND OUTREACH. TO LAND MANAGERS AIR DISTRICTS- TO TRAIN THEM ON KIND OF YOU KNOW WORKING TOGETHER AND FOR USING PEEPERS AS A WAY TO KIND OF. AND STANDARDIZE THAT PROCESS GOING FORWARD I'M NOT ALL PRESCRIBED BURNS ARE REPORTED INTO THE PEEPERS DISCUSSION AND WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING AT. WHAT'S REPORTED INTO OUR SYSTEM WHAT'S REPORTED IN. AND THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEING REPORTED WHERE AND TRY TO TRACK THAT. SO I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH BETTER I FIRE WE HAVE REPORTED TO OUR SYSTEM YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT THIS FARE OUT WE'D LIKE TO GET A FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT END. I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT TOO IS- AND ALL THIS INTO RIGHT HERE MISTER CHAIR AND AGAIN MISS CHANG THANK YOU FOR YOUR. COMMENTS AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. ALL GIVE MY OWN IT. THERE IS A PATCH WERE OF POLISH. IN BED WITH EACH YEAR JUST- AND THEY'RE JUST BOARD HOW THE APPROVAL. FOR OUT REGARDING FIRST FIRE. IF WE KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE OUR GREAT TOOLS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT CAN STREAMLINE THE PROCESS TO ENSURE FOLKS ON THE GROUND- I CAN MOVE FORWARD. AND I HAVE GREAT CONCERN. THAT IF WE DO NOT HAVE A STREAMLINED STATEWIDE PROCESS WE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO PRESCRIBED BURNING. AND WE HAVE A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE LIABILITY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE A LONGER TERM DISCUSSION BUT LET'S CONTROL WHAT WE CAN AND THAT'S THE STATE WIDE THE POTENTIAL STATEWIDE POLICY. INCONSISTENCY WITHIN THEIR DISTRICTS AND I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE CONVERSATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. VERY GOOD- CENTER STERN. IF QUESTIONS. YEAH THANKS MISTER- I HAD ONE I I'D. ONE POINT THOUGH HAD FORGET TO MAKE MAKE YOUR ISSUE NINE JUST FOR THE- DID WANT TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF TO IN A HAN CREWS. PHASING THEM ON A WE YEAR IS POSTED YOUR PARENTS I DID WANT TO NOTE MY AT. MY INCLINATION TO SPEED UP THE HAND CREATING GRATION IN AND ALSO ANOTHER ISSUE AROUND- OUR WORKERS SAFETY WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT. THAT BELONGS IN THIS DISCUSSION- WE DIDN'T REALLY GET INTO IT BUT L. A. TIMES EVEN YESTERDAY- TALKED ABOUT. THE TOXIC- THE TOXIC EMISSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN. IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF OUR CREWS IN I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY MONEY IN. ANY OF THIS ANY OF THESE POTS FOR RESPIRATORS- FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS- SO JUST WANT TO FLAG THOSE TWO. FOLKS WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BUT DO WE HAVE ANY MONEY FOR RESPIRATORS FOR CRUISE AND SPEEDING UP HAMPERS BUT ON THIS SPECIFIC RESILIENCE. EXPENDITURE PLAN I WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM THE DEPUTY SECRETARY- HOW DO YOU DO. RESULT AS A AT AS A- AS AN ADMIN RIGHT NOW. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SENATOR AND- YOU REALLY I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT PROBABLY I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT IT ACROSS WHAT DOES. HOW DO WE CREATE A SUSTAINABLE LIFE WITH FIRE- IN THE LANDSCAPE FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS. AND SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMING AND IS UPON US- WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR FIRE ECOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA IS OUT OF BALANCE. AND SO RESILIENCE IS REALLY GETTING US ONTO A SUSTAINABLE FOOTING AND SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IT'S ABOUT HOW DO YOU YOU KNOW THE LONG TERM VISION. FOR WHERE WE WANT TO END UP WITH- WITH OUR FIRED. RESILIENCE IN CALIFORNIA IS REALLY THAT WHEN YOU GET. THE WAVES AND LIGHT STRIKES AND THEY HIT THE LANDSCAPE PLEASE DON'T SPIRAL IN. CASTRO FIRES THAT- AND THAT WE HAVE PLANNED FOR WORST CASE SCENARIOS- OF THOSE REALLY HEAVY WIND DRIVEN- FIRES AND- AND HAVE TOOLS IN PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO PREVENT TECHNICIANS ON THOSE RED FLAG WARNING DAY GUEST THAT WE HAVE. IN PLACE- SAFETY. SO THAT WHEN A CATASTROPHIC FIRE DE COME THROUGH- THAT BECAUSE- IS SURVIVING AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW IF ANY TIME A FIRE COMES THROUGH COMMUNITY EVEN THE HOMES THAT ARE STANDING ARE STILL. SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGED WITH SMOKE AND- AND OTHER CHALLENGES SO RECOVERY IS ROUGH ONCE OF FIRES- YOU KNOW AT YOUR DOORSTEP BUT- BUT WE'RE TO GET TO A POINT. WE ARE PREHEATING THAT- THAT SENSE OF YOUR LONG TERM VISION OF WHERE CALIFORNIANS CAN LIVE WITHIN THE ECOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES THAT WE HAD AND THE NEW ECOLOGICAL NORMS THAT ARE GOING. TO BE UPON US WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. YEAH I GUESS I'M FROM FROM QUALITY BURST THAT MAY SENSE I JUST TRY TO GET THIS. IF YOU ALL OF TIME- TRYING TO QUANTIFY THAT ORDER AS A SOME OF METRICS YOU TO AVOID- HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO. RESILIENCE I. WHICH IS A BRIDGE TO FOR INSTANCE THE ARE DRIVING- ALLOW OF THE VILLAGE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT ACREAGE ALONE DEFINES RESILIENCE IF WE SUDDENLY TREAT A MILLION ACRES- IT IS THE STATE'S SAFER DEPENDS DEPENDS WHICH ONES- SO JUST. IT IT IT SAID IT MAY BE A LONGER TERM QUESTION OF THE L. A. O. IS ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BUT- TRYING TO GET SOMEWAY TO QUANTIFY. OUR RESILIENCE STRATEGY AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE OURSELVES ALONG THOSE METRICS TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING. YEAR ON YEAR- FOR INSTANCE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION BUDGET HERE AS YOU AS THE DEPUTY FIRE MARSHAL JUST POINTED OUT DOESN'T COVER ANY EXISTING HOMES EXCEPT FOR PEOPLE ARE SELLING. THAT'S THE ENTIRE BUDGET FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD HERE IS FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR. YOU SAID THERE'S TWO MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SEN SO WE'RE ABOUT. FEEL LIKE THAT IF YOU'D LIKE YOU KNOW OKAY SO WORK. HOW MANY BILLION SHORT JUST ON THAT FIRST CONCENTRIC CIRCLE YOU MENTION OF PARDONING ALONE I JUST I NEED IS I NEED WE NEED SOME METRICS TO BE THE RIGHT SIZE OUR STRATEGY HERE I'M JUST. TRYING TO GET THAT SET SO WE CAN EVALUATE OURSELVES. ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL- FOUNDATION AND I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE SENSE OF HOW OUR LAND USE HOW ARE PLANNING IS- ADAPTING AND MODERNIZING- AS OUR TECHNOLOGY AND DATA ANALYTICS ARE MODERNIZING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THESE. MORE WHAT A RESILIENT LANDSCAPES- AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES LOOK LIKE BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE A FACTOR OF ALL THREE OF THOSE COMBINATIONS THAT ONCE THOSE HEALTHIER LANDSCAPES. YOUR BRAKES TO REST A FIRE ESCAPE AND- AND SURVIVOR HARDENED INFRASTRUCTURE IN COMMUNITIES. AND SO- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TARGETS THAT MEASURE OUR WORKFORCE HONEST I HAVE BEEN LAID OUT SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT TARGET A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR TREATED IS BASED ON. THE FORCE CARBON PLANT WHICH IDENTIFIED ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION ACRES NOW THAT ARE IN NEED OF TREATMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE'VE GOTTEN OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO COMMIT. TO REACHING THAT LEVEL BUT A SENATOR DOLLY POINTED OUT- THEY'RE NOT THERE YET- THEY'VE BEEN INVESTING ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND HAZARDOUS FUEL REDUCTION. AND- WHEREAS THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL HAS ABOUT- SIX HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION THAT CAN BE ACROSS YOU KNOW IN THOSE- THOSE. SECTORS FOR HAZARDOUS YOU'LL BY COMPARISON AND SO- IT JUST IT'S REALLY CRUCIAL THAT WE ARE HITTING OUR TARGETS THAT EARLY OUT IN THE FOREST CARBON PLANNED- AS I MENTIONED TWO MILLION HOMES IN NEED A RETROFIT THAT NUMBER COMES FROM HE CALIFORNIA FIRE STATE COUNCILS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A HOME YOU'RE LOOKING AT UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO DO YOU. RETROFIT SO THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TOOLS LIKE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO BE ABLE TO HELP HOMEOWNERS THAT CAN AFFORD IT TO MAKE THOSE DIFFERENCES AND THEN MY VOICE COMMUNITIES. HERE BE ABLE TO- TO HELP SUPPORT MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND SO THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DO YOU KNOW LIKE ANY OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE'RE FACING WHETHER ITS DROUGHT- OR EXTREME HEAT. THERE'S A LOT OF EDUCATION THAT CAN ALSO REALLY HELP CALIFORNIANS- MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS AROUND THEIR HOME AND CAN. THAT CREATE THAT LED- RECENTLY- BUT- BUT WHEN OF THE THINGS WE DO YOU DO. ADDED THAT YOU HEALTH- THERE THAT CAN FIRE HOW OF THE FRAT PROGRAM. WHICH IS THEIR ANALYSTS UNIT THE- LOOK. I AT AT WHERE WE HAVE. LANDSCAPE AND PRIOR COME. I DON'T WHERE THE HIGH VIRUS ZONES ARE RIGHT NOW DEVELOP. A PRODUCT THAT IS TO BE HELP US. REALLY RAN. WHO RICH. ME ACROSS THE ENTIRE WATER. SO THAT LOOKS NOT JUST AT- FIRE RISK CAN SAFETY IT ALSO INTO- OTHER DAYS ANALYTICS AROUND CARDS. IN WATER HEALTH. AND- AND PART OF OUR JOB PLANNING YOUR SUPPORT SERVICE- IS TO BE TO I. WHO'S DOING WHAT WHERE. I'M ON A MAP SO THEN WHEN LAYER THAT OVER THESE- THESE AND TOOLS. THAT HELP SHE- WHERE THEY ARE- THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS WHETHER RISK IN. HABITAT WORK- THEN IT HELPS DESIGN. THESE PROJECTS BETTER BE ABLE TO REACH HIM EVERY. IMPACT BECAUSE WE'RE TO AVOID OUR WHAT JOKING KALRA ACTS OF. WHERE ARE GRANT KIND OF GO ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE HUMILITY. AND SO WE'RE TO HAVE A CALL. COOKIE SAID APPROACH THAT CAN BE CAN I. FEEL THE IMPACT- AND THE STATE IMPAIR OF. I'M SORRY I'M SORRY YOU OFF I JUST I KNOW WE WILL ABOUT FEW MORE MINUTES LEFT AND I JUST WANNA GET TO A BY. WHAT I'M HERE FROM USED A VERY STRATEGY. BUT WAIT THERE'S NO. METRICS THIS STRATEGY MENTIONED. THE CARBON IS AND HOW. SO YOU THE FORCE CAR PLAN YOU DON'T YEAH HAVE A PLAN TO HARDEN IT TO ME HOMES AND WHEN I HEARD IS. WE'RE LEAVE. WORKING INTO TO FIVE TO HOME ON DEFENSE SPACE. I DIDN'T HEAR A NUMBER FOR MANY FOLKS WE THINK WE'RE HARDEN- FROM THE SMALL- OF MONEY IN HERE I THINK TWENTY FIVE. MAY MAYBE TRYING TO LEVERAGE- BUT HOW MANY HOMES YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO. A FROM THIS PLAN- I APPRECIATE THE WORK FORCE NUMBERS THAT THAT THAT'S USEFUL BUT- I GUESS I'M I'M- YOU KNOW. SHE WE- TO GET TO RESILIENCE DO YOU KNOW HOW FAR. IT DO WE HAVE A DELIVERY DOLLAR ESTIMATE FOR HOW FAR BEHIND WE ARE TO GET TO RESILIENCE. SO LIKE I SAID IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO RETROFIT ALL OF THOSE TWO MILLION HOMES THAT'S TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ALONE ON THAT FRONT. RIGHT IT'S THE LANDSCAPE TO AND IT'S YEAH BYE SO. ALL IN WHAT ARE WE SHORT YOU GUYS HAVE A SENSE. I MEAN YOU'RE LOOKING AT. RIGHT IS SO IT JUST IT I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS STRATEGICALLY I MEAN THEY EXPIRE CRISIS DOESN'T FIT NEATLY INTO A BUDGET CYCLE. AND BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK STRATEGICALLY SO THAT THESE INVESTMENTS ACTUALLY START DELIVERING ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY I MEAN WE SAW STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS. THIS LAST YEAR IN THE FACE OF FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNING WITH OUR FIRE CREWS COMPLETELY STRETCHED OUT TO THE MAX AND TO BE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH THESE FIRES- WE FASTER HE FEEL GREAT STATE. YOU KNOW WHOLE TOWNS IN THE FACE OF REALLY INTENSIVE- FIRES WE SAW THEM SERVICE ESCAPE ROUTES WE SAW A HARDENED- YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES WHERE HOMES HAD BEEN HARD WORK ACTIVELY REALLY MAKE THOSE IMPACTS. IN THE END IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE DOLLARS RATE WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THAT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY. WHERE AND THEY'RE GOING TO HELP THE INSURANCE COMPANIES INCORPORATE SPEED- HARDENING STANDARDS INTO INSURANCE RISK MODELS BECAUSE AS INSURANCE COMPANIES START. ACTUALLY QUANTIFYING THE RISK REDUCTION THAT THESE ACTIVITIES ARE K. ARE ARE IMPACTING THAT WILL HELP CREATE FURTHER INCENTIVE SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PARTNERSHIPS. THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP REACH THESE GOALS THAT AREN'T JUST DIRECT STATE DOLLARS ON THE GROUNDS ENGINE OKAY I'LL I'LL YIELD. BACK TO THE CHAIR JUST- IN LIGHT OF THE T. WERE THERE. TRILLIONS AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING. JESTER A BILL- I JUST I'M I'M I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED THE SHORT. IN WHO LEFT YOUR IT'S LIKE WERE FOR OVER PIE THAT. YOU'LL LIKE A ZERO GAME BUT- I MEAN I JUST WANT TO NOTE FOR THE RECORD AND WILL BE WELL I'M SEEING GAUGING THIS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE EARLY ACTION ITEMS- IN THE BUDGET. GOING FORWARD AND THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE- BUT- EVEN THE HISTORIC TREND HERE EVEN ON THE FORCED HEALTH PROGRAM AND ON THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM WHICH I APPRECIATE SEEING IN HERE- AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL FORCING FIRE CAPACITY BUT- THE LARGE. LARGE MAJORITY THAT MONEY HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY A CARBON METRIC. THAT TENDS TO FAVOR PROJECTS WHERE THEIR BIG TREE STANDING- THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROJECTS HAVE NOT GONE TO. THE SORT OF MORE INTIMATE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS- THAT DIE YOU KNOW ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA. INTEREST BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE IN LOS ANGELES YOU ADD UP ALL THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HOW THEY FARED EVEN JUST WITHIN THIS THOSE TWO PROGRAMS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEWHERE AROUND AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. SO YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE AND THAT DISPARITY- IT MAY IT MAY HAVE A GOOD CARBON METRIC ON IT. IMEDI YOU MAY BE AVOIDED A LOT OF KARMA YOU HAVEN'T SAVED ENOUGH HOME SO WE WERE REALLY AYE I'M HOPING WE CAN GET. SOME MORE QUANTIFICATION- TO OUR STRATEGY HERE AND REALLY PUSH FORWARD HOMES AND PROPERTY SAVING AND LYFT SAVES AS THE CENTRAL DRIVING METRIC HERE- AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA ONLY TO LIVE TOGETHER SO PREACHY THE INNOVATION AND YOU GUYS HAVE DONE IN. YOUR YOU KNOW THAT THE NEW PRO GRAMMY LAID OUT HERE IS ENCOURAGING BUT- WE'RE NOT KEEP GOING TO THANK YOU ALL MISTER BENSON. I WANTED DIDN'T THAT I I'M THEM TO ON AND THE JUST OF FUNDS TO SETTING- WE HAVE BEEN SO GREAT FOR. SOUTHERN CAL. WE GET ABOUT OUR FUNDING IS BAY ON PARTY LANDSCAPES AND POP- WELL AS- THOSE REALLY FACTORY. ABOUT THIRTY ONE PER OF OUR CALL HAS GONE SEND. THROUGH THOSE HEALTH PROGRAM- AT ABOUT FORTY FOUR. TO NORTHERN REGIONS IN- AND THAT WHERE PREVENTION. IF YOU HAD HEALTHCARE FIBER YOUR UNDER TO YOU ON THOSE. BECAUSE THAT'S- WILL WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE GET YOU UPDATED- WE HAVE A AND FOUR FOUR PROP AT AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN AWARDED TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION- AND IT ALSO IS REALLY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN THIS REGIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING. IS BECAUSE- OUR GRANTS REALLY ARE FAVORING AREAS THAT ARE WRITING GRANTS. AND AND SO ABOUT 33% OF OUR GREAT REQUESTS ARE COMING FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND 31% OF OUR GRANT AWARDS. ARE GOING THERE AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE PART OF THE REASON WE ARE INVESTING IN REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS TO BE ABLE TO HELP INCREASE THAT GRANT WRITING CAPACITY BECAUSE THIS. REGION IS CRUCIAL THAT- THAT DESIGNING FIRE RESILIENCE IS REALLY- A PRIORITY AND SO I HOPE YOU SEE THIS BUDGET AS ANY EVENTS- AND I ALSO WANT CORRECT THE RECORD ON THE TRILLION WE CAN GET YOU SOME ACTUAL NUMBERS ON- IN TERMS OF BY WE CAN PRINT SOME. IN TERMS OF- HARDENING I. AS HE THAT FIFTY MILLION EIGHT OF. WILDLAND THE NEED TO BE ADJUSTED WHAT THAT PRICE TAG IS AND I WANTED JUST- ONE LAST POINT ON THAT IS WELL WHICH IS THIS STRATEGIC. FRAMEWORK DOES CREATE A- FOR FED PARTNERS TO CO IN WITH US- THAT THAT THAT HOME HARDENING TYLER WE- A VERY CALM. THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THOSE BE A MITIGATION DOLLARS AND ARE DESIGNING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PILOT. SHOULD BE ABLE TO- LUNCH THAT AND WE ARE.

MIKE FROM YEAH PLEASE MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION I'M A TAKE US ALL THE WAY BACK O THE VERY FIRST ITEM WE TALKED ABOUT VOTING- I'M A LITTLE FRUSTRATED ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT WITH. THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEEN PLACED ON THE TABLE AND WANT TO ADDRESS THAT CLEARLY WANNA LET THE DEPARTMENT KNOW WE APPRECIATE. THE PROPOSAL WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT FEEDING CREASES ON VOTERS PROBABLY NEED TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. BUT WE'VE KNOWN THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW. WE HAVE STAKEHOLDERS AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM OTHER LOBBYIST LATER. HAVE ENGAGE WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR A COUPLE YEARS BUT NOT GOTTEN THE ANSWERS THAT WE WANTED ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE FUND EXPENDITURES OF THE FUND REVENUES COMING IN. WE SENT A LETTER IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY LAST YEAR ASKING FOR ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ILLUMINATED IN THE STAFF REPORT. WE GOT A RECEIPT.

RELATIVE TO THE INVESTMENTS AND BEACH EROSION AND AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES- SHOULD NOT REST SOLELY ON THE BACKS OF THE VOTER FUNDED AT THEIR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND SHOULD TRY TO FUND THEM. THE LOAN PROGRAM HAS BEEN A STAPLE OF DEPARTMENT A BODY WATER WAYS FOR NUMBER OF YEARS THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT HASN'T BEEN USED MUCH BECAUSE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN AT NEAR ZERO. SO THE STATE HASN'T MADE ANY KIND OF CHANGES TO ITS PROGRAM TO ACCOMMODATE THAT THE PRESSURES AND THE COMPETITION FROM THE PRIVATE MARKET PLACE IT'S NOT THAT THE PROGRAM IS INVALUABLE IT'S JUST THE RIGHT NOW IT'S AND WEIRD CIRCUMSTANCES. THE BIGGEST THING THOUGH IS THIS TWENTY NINETEEN SHIFT TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE FUND YEAH WHERE IS THAT MONEY GOING AND WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE OVERALL AMOUNT SO A TALK ABOUT IT BUT IT'S NOT OUR PREFERRED SOLUTION AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS ADDRESSED AS WELL AGAIN I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DIVISION.

GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M WINSTON BUMPUS PRESIDENT OF RECREATIONAL BOATERS OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE ESTIMATED TWO MILLION VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS PROPOSED ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM BOATERS WHO MOST ARE MAKING. UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND 95% OF ALL REGISTERED BOATS WE BELIEVE OUR UNDER TWENTY TWENTY SIX FEET. OR UNDER OR SMALLER WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THE ACTIVITIESTHAT PEOPLE COULD DO DURING THE PANDEMIC VOTING WAS ONE OF THE SAFE OUT OUR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES- THAT THEY COULD DO- AND THEREFORE IT WAS A RECORD YEAR FOR BOTH SALES AND REGISTRATION FEES. THE BOTTOM LINE WE DON'T SUPPORT THE PROPOSED INCREASE TO THE VOTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS REGISTRATION FEES- BUT WE ALSO RESPECT YOUR WITH US BUT MEASURE BEFORE SHE THIS LETTER- FROM THE W. LAST NIGHT IN RESPONSE TO A LETTER WE- SENT TO THEM ON MAY TWENTIETH. IT PROVIDED SOME VERY INTERESTING INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST TIME INCLUDED INFORMATION THAT THE STATE GETS A HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN BOATING FUEL TAX FEES. AND ONLY FIFTEEN MILLION GOES TO D. B. W. OTHERS OF THAT GOES TO THE GENERAL FUND- AND STATE PARKS. AND THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY OF THE COUNTY PROPERTY TAXES PAID BY VOTERS WHICH IS MUCH LARGER NUMBER.

AND OTHER- MEETINGS AND REGARDING ALL THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE THING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S FORTY THOUSAND- INHABITANTS IN THE CONDITIONS IN THE FOREST I WILL ONE OF THINGS IS BEING OUR FIRST ROUND BOUT ISN'T ACTUALLY GETTING A LONG TERM PLAN TO ACTUALLY GET HELP THE POOREST OF LARGER OLDER TREES. OF ALL THIS EMERGENCY STUFF IS A VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO SO WITHOUT REALLY REBUILDING THE FOREST THERE WERE LIKE- SO MUCH- BECAUSE AFTER ALL WHO ARE TRULY AS LAUREN ACT. CRAZY IN THE SITUATION WE'RE IN NOW AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE- A REAL. DEDICATION DIRECTION CHANGES TO BE MORE. THAN JUST EMERGENCY NECKS I HAVE A COMMENT FROM LINE THIRTEEN THREE ZERO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO FIRST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING MY NAME IS BOB SHERMAN I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FOREST FOUNDATION. AN ORGANIZATION THAT DELIVERS MEANINGFUL CONSERVATION IMPACT BY EMPOWERING FAMILY FOREST OWNERS TO TAKE ACTION ON THEIR LAND. FF WORKS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILY FOREST OWNERS. AND THESE LANDS THAT COMPRISE A THIRD OF HIGH RISK POOREST AREAS IN THE STATE MAKING TREATMENT EVERYONE'S PLANS. A PRIORITY IN WILDFIRE RISK MITIGATION. OF THE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN ALSO STATES. WE INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE OF COURSE MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE STATE CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THEIR SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SMALL PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THE NUMBER OF INCREASED INVESTMENT IN WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCY THAT AFFECT ON OUR PARTNERS ARE PROUD TO STAND BEHIND. SHORT AND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS LIKE THE POOREST HEALTH PROGRAM AND SPEAKER IN ADDITION THE WORKFORCE TRAINING MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER PRIORITIES WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURING FAMILY FOREST OWNERS CAN CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING WILDFIRE CREDIT THAT. PROVIDING CONSISTENT FUNDING TO PROGRAMS LIKE SEE IF IT IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR ITS PRODUCTION ON FAMILY POOREST ACRES. BUT HAS BEEN DEBATED MANY TIMES THIS MORNING BROUGHT INVESTMENT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA FORESTS WILL BE PROTECTED FROM THE INCREASING THREAT CLIMATE CHANGE. FOR THESE REASONS THE AMERICAN FOREST FOUNDATION SUPPORTS THE BILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR INCREASED INVESTMENT. IN SMALL IN CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN.

SURGICALLY ON THE PUBLIC BEACH RESTORATION- THIS- THIS- PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNDED BY BOTH A DOLLARS FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMBALANCE OF THE H. W. R. S. AND- I HAVE SOME SERIOUS DIFFICULTY. IN UNDERSTANDING WHY VOTERS ARE BEING ASKED TO BEAR TWO HUNDRED AND 50% C. INCREASE TO CORRECT THE IMBALANCE- ON THE AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES PROGRAM. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT- DERIVE BENEFIT FROM MATH PROGRAM- BOATING DOLLARS HAVE BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS- TO FUND IT. AND VOTERS NOW. HAVE AGREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY NEED TO BEAR A 210050% SEE INCREASED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. AND KWAGGA AND ZEBRA MUSSEL INFESTATION. THERE IS ALREADY A SEPARATE FEE SURCHARGE IMPOSED ON VOTERS WHO LAUNCH THEIR BOATS IN FRESH WATER TO THAT SUPPOSED TO FUND THIS PROGRAM.
