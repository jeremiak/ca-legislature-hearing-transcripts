AB THREE NINETY TWO IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARD CHANGING LAW ENFORCEMENT BEHAVIOR TOWARD PEOPLE OF COLOR. AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM CAN RAISE. QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDERS THERE ARE SOME THAT BELIEVE THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR. AND THEN OTHERS THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. WHAT IS CLEAR HOWEVER AT THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL CONVERSATION ABOUT PROTECTING THE LIVES OF CIVILIANS? AND OFFICERS ALIKE. IS SIMPLY TOO IMPORTANT TO LET IT FAIL. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS COMMERCE CONVERSATION IS DEEPLY PERSONAL AND EMOTIONALLY CHARGED FOR INDIVIDUALS ON ALL SIDES OF DISCUSSION. I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER. TO ENSURE ALL VOICES ARE HEARD. AND RESPECTED AND RESPECTED THIS MORNING. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE WE HAVE COME TO A PERIOD IN TIME WHERE PEOPLE YELL AND FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THEY HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. AND TO DATE THAT MUST STOP. WE CANNOT MAKE PROGRESS BY SHUTTING PEOPLE OUT WE CAN ONLY GROW AND MOVE FORWARD BY WORKING TOGETHER FOR BETTER. AND SAFER SOLUTIONS FOR ALL. WHAT GOOD IS A POLICY CHANGE WITHOUT THE BUY IN OF THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT? WHAT GOOD ARE REVISED TRAINING STANDARDS WITHOUT TRUE COMMUNION ENGAGEMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT? TODAY IS THE FIRST STEP IN A LONG PROCESS -- WANTED I BELIEVE WE WILL ALL BENEFIT FROM AS WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH THAT [inaudible] DOCTOR WEBER. YOU MAY PRESENT THAT'S WELL PUT IT UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE -- I WANT TO BEGIN BY FIRST THANKING THE CHEER FOR HIS SUPPORT AND ONGOING HELP AND IN FASHIONING THIS BILL AND ORGANIZING TODAY'S MEETING -- I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS BECAUSE I THINK I'VE MET WITH EACH ONE OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY -- ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR GOALS ARE BUT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH WITH AB. THREE NINE TWO I'M HERE TO PRESENT YOU AB THREE NINE TO THE CALIFORNIA ACT TO SAVE LIVES. THIS BILL SEEKS TO CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL STANDARD WHEN POLICE CAN USE DEADLY FORCE TO MATCH BEST PRACTICES ALREADY IN PLACE AT SOME DEPARTMENTS. AND THAT WE KNOW WORK TO KEEP BOTH OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC SAFE. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OFFICERS KILLED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. MOST OF THOSE WERE UNARMED. OF THE FIFTEEN POLICE DEPARTMENTS WITH THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA RATES OF POLICE KILLINGS IN IN THE NATION. FIVE OF THEM ARE IN CALIFORNIA. BAKERSFIELD STOCKTON LONG BEACH SANTA ANA AND SAN BERNADINO. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN POLICE IN KERN COUNTY KILLED MORE PEOPLE PER CAPITA. THAN ANY OF THE U. S. COUNTY. CURRENT LAW RESULTS. IN OFFICES KILLINGS OF BILLION FAR MORE OFTEN THAN UNNECESSARY LEAVING MANY FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC LESS SAFE. THESE TRAGEDIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. STUDIES SHOW PLEASE KILL ON ARM YOUNG BLACK MEN AND MORE THAN TWENTY TIMES THE RATE THE KILL YOUNG WHITE MAN. THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLY CREATED A RIFT BETWEEN POLICE AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO THE DETRIMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. THE POWER OF POLICE OFFICERS TO USE DEADLY FORCE IS PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY WE CONFER ON ANY PUBLIC OFFICIAL. AND MUST BE GUIDED BY THE GOAL OF SAFEGUARDING HUMAN LIFE. POLICE OFFICER SHOULD NEVER TAKE A HUMAN LIFE WHEN THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW SANCTIONS POLICE USE OF DEADLY FORCE EVEN WHEN OFFICERS DO NOT FACE AN IMMINENT THREAT TO THEIR LIFE. OR OR BODILY SECURITY AND EVEN OFFICES HAVE REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO SAFELY ADDRESS A SITUATION WITHOUT TAKING ANYONE'S LIFE. CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING LAW GOVERNING WHAT A HOMICIDE BY AN OFFICER IS JUSTIFIED WAS WRITTEN IN. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THIS CODE BEING THE SINGLE OLDEST UNAMENDED USED BEFORE STATUTES IN THE COUNTRY. NOT ONLY FAILS TO INCLUDE BEST PRACTICES BUT AUTHORIZES DEADLY FORCE THAT VIOLATES THE US CONSTITUTION. PENAL CODE EIGHT THIRTY FIVE A WHICH REGULATES POLICE USE OF FORCE WAS ENACTED IN SEVENTEEN FIFTIES IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND IS THE SECOND OLDEST A MINUTE USE OF FORCE STATUE IN THE COUNTRY. AB THREE NINE TWO IS ABOUT PREVENTING UNNECESSARY DEATHS BY CLARIFYING LAW ENFORCEMENT OBLIGATIONS WHEN MAKING THE DECISION TO USE DEADLY FORCE. THIS BILL LIMITS THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE BY POLICE OFFICER TO THOSE SITUATION WHERE IT IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT IMMINENT AND SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH. TO THE OFFICER OR ANOTHER PERSON. THE BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE OFFICE ISSUES DE ESCALATION TACTICS WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THE BILL IS SQUARELY IN LINE WITH BEST PRACTICES STANDARDS RECOGNIZED BY ACADEMICS AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND IS MODELED AFTER POLICIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE AT SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. THESE DENNIS A KNOWN TO REDUCE SERIOUS USE OF TWO TO REDUCE SERIOUS YOU SUPPORT WITHOUT HAVING ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OFFICER SAFETY OR PUBLIC SAFETY. AS A RESULT OF IT THIS BILL ALL AGENCIES WILL REQUIRE TO UPDATE THE POLICIES TO UNDERSTAND THESE BEST PRACTICES AND TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS ARE TRAINED TO THE STANDARDS. SOME POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE THEY THEY NEED TO HOLD THEMSELVES TO A HIGHER STANDARD UP TO UPDATING THE USE OF FORCE POLICIES TO ADOPT BEST PRACTICES. LIKE REQUIRING THE ESCALATION WHEN FEASIBLE USING FORCE THAT IS PROPORTIONAL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OBJECTIVES AND GROUNDING THE PROP POLICIES IN THE SAME CITY OF HUMAN LIFE. A THREE YEAR STUDY OF SEATTLE USE OF FORCE POLICY WHICH INCLUDES KEY ELEMENTS OF AB THREE NINE TO SHOW THAT IT RESULTED IN OFFICES USING LESS FORCE WITH NO NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OFFICER SAFETY OR PUBLIC SAFETY. SINCE SAN FRANCISCO IMPLEMENTED A SIMILAR POLICY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEIR USES OF FORCE HAS ALSO BROUGHT GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY. BOTH OF THESE POLICIES LIKE THE OTHER POLICIES ADOPTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT CONTAIN THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL WERE DEVELOPED UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE OBAMACARE A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IN ADDITION THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RECOMMENDED CHANGES TO SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT'S USE OF FORCE TRACKS CLOSELY WITH AB. THREE NINE TWO FOR EXAMPLE THE AG RECOMMENDED THAT SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT QUOTE REQUIRE THAT OFFICES EXHAUST ALL REASONABLY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES BEFORE USING DEADLY FORCE. MUCH LIKE WHAT IS REQUIRED UNDER AB. THREE NINE TWO IT IS OBVIOUS TO SO MANY PEOPLE THAT OUR CURRENT STANDARD FOR USING FORCE AND SPECIFICALLY DEADLY FORCE. DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE OR PROTECT PEOPLE'S FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. AB THREE NINE TWO IS A NECESSARY STEP TO AFFIRM THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND PROTECTING HUMAN LIFE. BY NEARLY A CENTURY FOR NEARLY A CENTURY AND A HALF CALIFORNIANS HAVE WITNESSED THE JUSTIFICATION OF PLEASE HOMICIDES DUE TO A STANDARD THAT ALLOWS THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. EVEN IF THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES. FAR TOO MANY DAYS HAVE GONE BY WITH FAR TOO MANY DEATHS BECAUSE OF THE INACTION OF THOSE WHO HAVE THE POWER TO ENACT CHANGE. THE NEED FOR REFORM IS CLEAR AND LONG OVERDUE. AND IT'S TIME TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE SAME TO YOU OF HUMAN LIFE IS POLICING HIGHEST PRIORITY IT IS TIME FOR US TO ENACT A STATE POLICY THAT WILL SAVE LIVES. HERE TO TESTIFY OF ON THIS BILL AFTER MY CO AUTHOR SPEAKS WILL BE THE RETIRED DEPUTY CHIEF OF IRVINE POLICE CHIEF JEFF NOBLE. THE CLICK SKI OUR HAMILTON WHO WAS A COUSIN OF DANTE OF VAPOR. OF THE RETIRED TO IT LAPD OF CHIEF. AND THEIR LIVES MEDINA WHO IS THE MOTHER OF CHRISTIAN -- ESCOVEDO WHO WAS KILLED IN BY LAPD AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN MISTER CARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I PROBABLY COULD PRESENT EIGHTY THREE NINETY WITH DOCTOR WEBER AS YOU MENTIONED WITH UPDATE OUR HUNDRED YEAR OLD LAW. RELATED DEADLY FORCE. AND FOCUS ON MAKING SURE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE FOR THE TIME FOR CHANGE IS NOW. THE REALITY IS THAT 99% OF THE TIME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DO NOT CROSS THE LINE WITH UNNECESSARY DEADLY FORCE. BUT WHEN THE 1% HAPPENS THERE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CURRENT STANDARD IS OUTDATED DOESN'T PROTECT AGAINST UNNECESSARY LOSS OF LIFE AND DOES NOT HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT DE ESCALATE INCIDENTS. THESE TRAGEDIES ARE HAPPENING HAPPENING FAR TOO OFTEN. WE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE TRAGIC DEATH OF STUFF ON CLARK IN MY HOME TOWN HERE. TEN MILES DOWN THE ROAD. WHEN A YOUNG MAN WHO SHOT AND KILLED BY SACRAMENTO POLICE OFFICERS WHO MISTER MISTOOK HIS CELLPHONE FOR A GUN? HOWEVER THE FATAL SHOOTING TEN MILES DOWN THE ROAD OF MICHAEL MCINTYRE AND HIGHWAY FIFTY SHOWS THE NEED FOR CHANGE. AFTER THE SHOOTING OUR FORMER POLICE CHIEF RICK BRAZIL WHO IS A SACRAMENTO INSPECTOR GENERAL CONCLUDED THAT THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS FIRED AT MCINTYRE WERE EXCESSIVE. UNNECESSARY AND PUT THE COMMUNITY AT RISK AND ARE ADEQUATE RESOURCES ON THE GROUND I SLAIN CONTAIN MCINTYRE WITHOUT FIRING ADDITIONAL SHOTS. BRAZIL CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE OPTIONS TO AVOID DEADLY FORCE. OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY CHOSE NOT TO FILE CHARGES SHE SAID SHE DID IT BY THE BOOK. THIS SHOWS NEED TO RE EVALUATE THE BOOK. DOWN LA IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AN LA POLICE OFFICER SHOT AND KILLED AN UNARMED HOMELESS MAN BRANDON GLENN. GLENN WAS ON HIS STOMACH PUSHING HIMSELF UP AN OFFICER STEP BACK AND SHOT HIM TWICE IN THE BACK KILLING HIM. AFTER THE SHOOTING THE LA POLICE DEPARTMENT FILED THERE IN THAT STARTED INVESTIGATION AND THE POLICE CHIEF MISTER BACK IN A RARE INSTANCE SAID THAT THE OFFICER. NEEDS TO BE PROSECUTED HE SAID IN RARE OCCASIONS WHERE SHOOTING IS NOT JUSTIFIED NOT LEGAL THE OFFICER SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. THE LA DISTRICT ATTORNEY JACKIE LACEY DECIDE NOT TO FILE CHARGES SAID THERE WAS NOT A REASONABLE DOUBT EVEN THOUGH AND THE OFFICER ACTED WITHIN THE LAW. AND I GUESS THIS LEADS TO THE QUESTION IF THE POLICE CHIEF BUT LET'S NATION'S SECOND LARGEST CITY SHOWS THAT AN OFFICER ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY BROKE THE LAW SHOULD BE FIRED AND PROSECUTED DA SAYS NOPE IT'S ALL GOOD WE SHOULD RE EVALUATE THE CURRENT SYSTEM. EVEN THOUGH THERE WEREN'T FILES CHARGED IN THE GLENN CASES CITY OF LA PAID FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO THE FAMILY. THAT'S ONE THING WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IN YOUR CITY MISTER CHAIR IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE CITY OF LA HAD TO BORROW ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM WALL STREET TO PAY OUT. WRONGFUL DEATH SETTLEMENTS THESE ARE MONIES THAT COULD GO TO OTHER USES IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO RIGHT NOW IS NEGOTIATING A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR. WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT IN THE CLERK. IN THE CLERK INCIDENT AGAIN MONEY THAT COULD GO TO OTHER PURPOSES. LASTLY THAT THE OPPOSITION STATES AT THIS BILL WOULD UNDERMINE POLICING AND OFFICERS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB WHEN WHEN I DO THEIR JOB. BUT AS DOCTOR WEB STATED THIS JUST ISN'T TRUE THE POLICY IS BASED UPON BEST PRACTICES IN THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE STANDARDS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE IN MAJOR WEST COAST CITIES SEATTLE AND SAN FRANCISCO. THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE SEEN FEWER OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS COMMUNITIES ARE SAFER WE BROUGHT BACK PUBLIC TRUST. IN CONCLUSION CHANGE IS HARD. BUT WE KNOW THERE'S A BETTER WAY WITH US TODAY IS THAT BETTER WAY RESPECTFULLY ASK THE RIGHT. THANK YOU. SO THE FOUR WITNESSES. YOU HAVE A TEN MINUTE. ALTOGETHER HI YOU BREAK IT UP IT'S UP TO YOU -- IF I STOP YOU IS NOT. BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW ANY. MALICE TOWARDS YOU OR ANYTHING OR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE OF WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS FAIR AS WE CAN TO BOTH SIDES. AND JUST QUICKLY. PEOPLE UP HERE TO THIS WE CAN SEE YOU AND WE INFILL. THAT'S THIS IS A GOOD THING. AND YOU'VE BEEN VERY GOOD SO WHOEVER WANTS TO BEGIN FIRST. GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MR SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEFF NOBLE AND IS A FORMER DEPUTY CHIEF OF POLICE I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE NINETY TWO I SPENT TWENTY NINE YEARS AS A POLICE OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA RETIRING AS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF POLICE OF THE IRVINE POLICE DEPARTMENT. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I HAVE SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS IN USE OF FORCE CASES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. INCLUDING CASES THAT INVOLVE THE DEATHS OF TO MERE RICIN PHILANDER CASTEEL. BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE I AM CONFIDENT THAT AB THREE NINETY TWO IS A REASONABLE STEP TOWARD REDUCING SHOOTINGS BY POLICE OFFICERS IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY AND BEGINNING THE PROCESS. OF REBUILDING TRUST BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE MEANT TO SERVE. AB THREE NINETY TWO CHANGES THE LAWS GOVERNING POLICE USE OF FORCE IN CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OFFICERS CAN'T USE DEADLY FORCE IF A REASONABLE OFFICER WOULD THINK THAT THERE ARE CURRENT LIVES AVAILABLE. THAT'S NOT FAR FROM THE STANDARDS QUIRK SUPPLY NOW BUT BY REQUIRING ALTERNATIVES ONLY WHEN REASONABLE. THE BILL REQUIRES OFFICERS TO USE LESS LETHAL WEAPONS AND PRACTICE DE ESCALATION IN THOSE EIGHT SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S SAFE TO DO SO. IN DOING THAT THE BILL IS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT ON EXISTING LAW. THE PROPOSED CHANGE IS WRONG LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS OUT IN OPPOSITION. AND IN THIS REGARD FOR THE VERY REAL NEED FOR CHANGE. BY ARGUING THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED DANGER FOR OFFICERS. I BELIEVE THEY ARE WRONG. I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT OFFICERS HAVE A TOUGH JOB. A JOB THAT REQUIRES MAKING INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT DECISIONS OFTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITHOUT TRYING TO REVIEW A MANUAL OR CONSULT THE SUPERVISOR. EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES. UNDER THE BILL OFFICERS ACTIONS ARE EVALUATED THROUGH THE LENS OF AN OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE POLICE OFFICER BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. KNOWN TO THE OFFICER AT THE TIME. THIS SAME APPROACH TO EVALUATING POLICE USE OF FORCE AS COURTS IN DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY USE UNDER THE GROUND STANDARD. NO REASON LOSS OR THINKS IN OFFICER CONFRONTING AN ACTIVE SHOOTER HAS TO START NEGOTIATING A TRY TASER FURS. WHEN OFFICERS CONFRONTED WITH pIMMEDIATE LIFE THREATENING DANGER THE NECESSITY STANDARD WILL STILL ALLOW OFFICERS TO USE DEADLY FORCE TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE OR TO PROTECT OTHERS? IN THE END AB THREE NINETY TWO STANDS FOR SIMPLE RULE. POLICE SHOULD USE DEADLY FORCE WHEN IT IS SAFE AND REASONABLE TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION IN SOME OTHER WAY. THIS IS NOT A RADICAL CHANGE. INDY AB THREE NINETY TWO PROVIDES A STANDARD IS CONSISTENT WITH MUCH OF CURRENT LAW AND POLICY THAT MOST OF THE PUBLIC AGREES WITH AND MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ASSUME IS ALREADY IN PLACE. BY WRITING THE STANDARDS INTO LAW EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO INSURERS THE DEPARTMENT'S STATEWIDE WILL CHANGE THEIR POLICIES AND TRAIN TO CONFORM TO STAY LONG. AND BY SETTING STATEWIDE STANDARDS AB THREE NINETY TWO INSURERS OFFICERS CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY USE DEADLY FORCE UNNECESSARILY. TO ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINE CIVIL LIABILITY OR CRIMINAL CHARGES. AB THREE NINETY ONE COURAGE OFFICERS TO YOU SOUND TACTICS AND DISCOURAGE THEM FROM GETTING INTO AVOIDABLE FIGHTS. BOTH CHANGES WILL MAKE OFFICERS CHANGE OFFICER SAFER THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT AB [inaudible] THREE NINETY TWO NEXT. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS YEAR HAMILTON. AND I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE MY FAMILY HAS GONE TO SOMETHING NO FAMILY SHOULD EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH. I'M HERE TODAY TO ACTUALLY TO PASS AB THREE NINETY TWO OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ON APRIL FIFTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MY COUSIN DIED IN A SEA OF POLICE BULLETS IN A WALMART PARKING LOT IN BARSTOW. FOR OFFICES FAR THIRTY SHOTS AT BEYOND SAY. THAT THE CAR HE WAS DRIVING AND TASED HIM AND LEAVING HIM TO CHOKE ON HIS OWN BLOOD. ONE OF THE OFFICERS WHO SHOT YA SE WAS PREVIOUSLY CHARGED WITH A HATE CRIME. AND RACIAL SLURS AN ATTACK ON A MAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN SO WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT OUR POLICING CALIFORNIAN AMERICA. THAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE ARE NOT SAFE FROM STATE SANCTIONED VIOLENCE EVERY YEAR COUNTLESS FAMILIES LIKE MINE Là SUFFER FROM THE PAIN OF LOSING SOMEONE AS AMAZING AND KIND OF THE ON TODAY. BEYONCE HERE BUT SHE LIKE WE CALL HIM AFFECTIONATELY WAS A FAMILY MAN WHO WOULD GIVE HIS LAST TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS OKAY. HE WAS SELFLESS ANY LOVE JUST THREE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS MORNING ANYTHING IN A ROW AND THEY LOVED HIM. BUT SHE SMILE WAS CONTAGIOUS HE WAS ALWAYS SMILING AND YOU KNOW WE LOVE SINGING AS RB SONGS AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS. HE LOVES PLAYING WITH HIS FAMILY FRIENDS BASKETBALL FOOTBALL JUST LIKE ANY OTHER. TWENTY SIX ZERO EVERY MEMORY I HAVE THEM IS FUN. THERE WAS NEVER A DULL MOMENT WITH BUT SHE HE WAS TAKEN FROM US BECAUSE THE POLICE IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE ALLOWED TO SHOOT PEOPLE EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE ALTERNATIVES TO DEADLY FORCE. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO PASS AB THREE NINETY TWO I WANT TO FEEL PROTECTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT A FOR MY LIFE BECAUSE THEY MY MISTAKE MY FALL FOR A GUN. OR MAY SHOULDN'T TO A VEHICLE THAT I MEAN BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF MY SKIN. WE CAN SAVE LIVES BY MAKING SURE POLICE ARE TRYING TO USE THE ESCALATION TACTICS BEFORE JUST SHOOTING TAKING SOMEONE'S LIFE. POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PRESERVE LIFE THEY NEED TO START EMPATHIZING WITH THE PEOPLE. OFFICER SHOULD ALSO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY UNJUSTLY KILL SOMEBODY JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BEFORE THE ONTO WAS KILLED I WASN'T INTERESTED IN POLITICS OR ACTIVISM. I KNOW THAT POLICING BARS TO WERE RACES AND THAT THEY HARASS PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE ENTREE WAS MURDER THAT I REALIZED THAT MY VOICE HAD TO BE KNOWN. AND REMEMBER IN MEMORY OF THE ON TO ASK THAT YOU PLEASE PASS AB THREE NINE TO HELP US HONOR HIM AND THE COUNTLESS PEOPLE. A CALLOUS OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE KILLED BY POLICE BY TAKING. THIS IMPORTANT STEP TO MAKE SURE FEWER FAMILIES HAVE TO ENDURE THIS PAIN THANK YOU THANK YOU FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ELIZABETH MEDRANO ESCOVEDO AND MY SON CHRISTIAN ANTHONY WAS KILLED BY LAPD OFFICER AND ORDERED CALCUTTA PUBLIC BACK DIVISION ON JANUARY FOURTEENTH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN MY SON CHRISTIAN WAS A POLITE RESPECTFUL COMPASSIONATE CARING YOUNG MAN. I LAST SAW HIM FOR DINNER THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS KILLED BEFORE HE LEFT HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND SAID GOOD NIGHT AND HE LOVED ME. LITTLE DID I KNOW I WOULD NEVER HEAR THOSE WORDS EVER AGAIN. ON THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JANUARY FOURTEENTH AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO GET A RIDE HE AND A FRIEND DECIDED TO WALK HOME BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET TO IS BAD THEY WALKED HIMSELF THE MONEY TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD OF MONTICELLO HIGH IT'S A LOS ANGELES. WHICH IS. WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF HOURS LONG. THEY GOT TO THE CORNER BILLION AND I'M AT THIS A WERE EXHAUSTED HE LAID TO REST IN THE DRIVEWAY BEHIND FOR PARKED VEHICLES OF THAT DRIVEWAY AND ENDED UP FALLING ASLEEP. A CALL WAS MADE TO LAPD HOLLENBECK DIVISION OF TWO MEN SLEEPING BEHIND A VEHICLE. THE DISPATCHER PUT UP THE CALL EIGHTY W. ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON SUSPECTS AT NO TIME WERE THEY COMMITTED A CRIME THEY WERE SLEEPING. THEY WERE JUST LAME AND RESTING ON THE PAVEMENT IN A DRIVEWAY. AUTHORED AGONIST PARTNER RESPONDED TO THE CALL ALTHOUGH OFFICER ATTACK AMID CLAIMS TO HAVE WORKED WITH THE SAME PARTNER ENORMOUS OCCASION AND HAVE THE DISCUSS TACTICS DEPLOYMENT DE ESCALATION PURPOSES IN THE PAST WITH THE SAME PARTNER. THEY FAILED TO FOLLOW POLICIES IN REGARDS TO ANY OF THE ABOVE. MENTIONED TACTICS. IF THEY ALSO THOUGHT THAT MY SLEEPING SON WAS A THREAD WHY DID HE USE A TASER CALL FOR BACK UP OR TAKE COVER BEHIND THE FOUR VEHICLES THAT WERE PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY. HE DIDN'T EVEN IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS A POLICE OFFICER NOR GIVE VERBAL COMMANDS THEN AFTER HE KILLED MY SON HE TRY TO JUSTIFY IT POLICE KNOW THE MAGIC WORDS I FEAR FOR MY LIFE. JUST BY SAYING THAT THEY FEAR. JUST BY SAYING THAT THEY WERE IN FEAR THEY GET AWAY WITH KILLING PEOPLE MY SON'S LIFE WAS CUT SHORT. WHEN ALSO TACKLE CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN IMPAIR FOR HIS SAFETY AND SHOT AND KILLED MY SON CHRISTIAN? HE DID NOT CALL FOR BACK UP BECAUSE HE STATED IT WAS A BUSY NIGHT AND CLOSE TO THE IN THE SHIP HE STATED HE DID NOT CALL FOR AIR SHOULD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD RESPOND AT THE TIME OF DAY. HE DID NOT TAKE COVER BEHIND THE FOR PARKED VEHICLES HE CLAIMED THAT HE WAS IN FEAR FOR HIS SAFETY GET FAILED TO USE HIS RESOURCES. HE COULD HAVE USED A TASER CALLED FOR BACKUP USE RUBBER BULLETS OR LESS LETHAL WEAPON THIS BILL IS BASICALLY EVERYTHING THAT THEY DIDN'T DO AND CHRISTIANS CASE HAD THIS BEEN. BILL BEEN LONG CHRISTIAN WOULD STILL BE ALIVE POLICE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS IF THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY USE OTHER MEANS THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO USE IT. THIS BILL CAN SAVE MOTHERS FROM GRIEVING THE LOSS OF THEIR CHILDREN. WHICH IS WHAT I'M EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. REGGIE TO PASS ASSEMBLY BILL THREE NINETY TWO AND MAKE IT LONG IT WOULD SAVE COUNTLESS LIVES. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES. MY NAME IS CHERYL DORSEY I'M RETIRED LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT SERGEANT AS A RETIRED VETERAN SERGEANT LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT HAVING SPENT TWENTY YEARS IN PATROL. MY LIVED EXPERIENCES FORM THE BASIS UP SUPPORTING LEGISLATION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES EVIDENCE OF UNNECESSARY USE OF DEADLY FORCE IN THE RELUCTANCE BY SOME OFFICERS TO DE ESCALATE CONTENTIOUS. ENCOUNTERS EXIST JUST BECAUSE AN ALLEGED SUSPECT ATTEMPTS TO EVADE ARREST BY JUMPING FENCES AND HIDING IN A BACKYARD HE SHOULD NOT BE EXECUTED ONE COUNT. WHEN CORNERED STEFAN CLARK WAS CHASED INTO A CONTAINED AREA OFFICERS WERE AIDED BY THE ELIMINATION OF AN AIR UNIT? RATHER THAN SEE COVER AND CONCEALMENT AND ESTABLISH A PERIMETER THE OFFICER FIRED TWENTY ROUNDS IS DEFINED THEY WERE CONSUMED BY CONTAGIOUS GUNFIRE THEIR OWN THE OFFICERS CLAIMED THEY THOUGHT. STEFAN HAD SHOT THEM HE HADN'T THE OFFICERS CLAIMED THEY THOUGHT STEPAN HAD A GUN HE DIDN'T BECAUSE GREAT DIFFERENCES GIVEN TO AN OFFICER'S VERSION OF THE DANCE. THE PROSECUTORS PROSECUTORS CITED WITH THE OFFICERS EVEN THOUGH NEITHER PAUSED IN THE MIDST OF THOSE TWENTY ROUNDS TO REASSESS WHETHER OR NOT A THREAT EXISTED WHILE OFFICERS WERE CALLED TO MAKE SPLIT SECOND LIVE PERSON DEATH DECISIONS OFFICERS ARE ALSO EXPECTED. TO RELY ON THEIR TRAINING AND COMMONSENSE POOR TACTICS LEAD TO UNNECESSARY SHOOTINGS OFFICERS ARE TRAINED IN I'D TARGET IDENTIFICATION AT HER PRACTICE SHOOT DON'T SHOOT SCENARIOS AND SHOULD KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SHOOTING AND WHY. ABSENT IMMEDIATE DEFENSE OF LIFE OR SOME OTHER EXIGENCY ARKHAM STANCE DE ESCALATION SHOULD ALWAYS BE A CONSIDERATION FOR THOSE WHO SAY THAT HAVING OFFICERS GO THROUGH A MENTAL CHECKLIST PRIOR. TO FIRING THEIR WEAPONS WOULD ENDANGER THEIR LIVES I SAY THEY ARE BEING INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST FOR THOSE WHO SAY THAT AB THREE NINETY TWO WILL NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE POTENTIAL RECRUITS. I SAY THAT NOT EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO BE THE POLICE SHOULD BE THE POLICE. BEING A POLICE OFFICER REQUIRES GOOD JUDGMENT MENTAL READINESS IN THE ABILITY TO ACT IN CONCERT WITH ONCE TRAINING MUCH LIKE A SURGEON A PILOT OR SHELF. PSYCHOLOGICAL RE EVALUATIONS POLICE OFFICER LACKS THE SLACK THE SKILL SET OR TO PERMIT TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY DISTRESSFUL HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES WHICH IS INHERENT TO POLICE WORK THIS IS NOT THE JOB FOR YOU POLICE CHIEFS IN UNION TO MINIMIZE TO MITIGATE BAD BEHAVIOR. DO A DISSERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY AB THREE NINETY TWO WILL NOT PREVENT A POLICE OFFICER FOR SHOOTING SOMEONE WITHOUT JUST CAUSE BUT IT MAY GIVE AN OFFICER POTS AND FOR THAT REASON I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. SO NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION AND DOCTOR WEBER MISTER. MR MCCARTY WE MAYBE OR THE STOCK TO WORK -- MAYBE CALL YOU BACK FOR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE SO. SO. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SUGGESTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO STAND. PLEASE LOOK BEHIND YOU COULD OR SOMETHING BUT IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAND UP. THAT YOU MAY BE BLOCKING HIM FROM SEEING. THE THE WITNESSES SO I WOULD. URGING NOT TO STAND BECAUSE YOU YOU YOU NEVER KNOW. A WITNESS HERE MAY CONVINCE SOMEBODY TO MAKE ANY OPPOSITION. THAT CAN'T SEE YOUR CAME HERE FROM THE WITNESSES AND SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE SO SOME COURTESY THE PEOPLE BEHIND YOU SO THEY CAN ALSO SEE -- AND HERE WHAT'S GOING ON WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SHANE LEVINE AND I REPRESENT THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE CALIFORNIA LODGE. I WANT TO BEGIN MY FIRST ACKNOWLEDGING THE PAIN IN A MOTION THIS ISSUE HAS COST BEING IN AN US VERSUS THEM SITUATION IS NOT IDEAL FOR ANY OF US. LOSS OF LIFE NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THIS DEBATE YOU ARE ON IS PAINFUL AND LIFE ALTERING. ONE FORSMAN IS OFTEN THRUST IN THE LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONS NOT BY CHOICE BUT BY OATH. UNFORTUNATELY AB THREE NINETY TWO WOULD CREATE AN UNTENABLE SITUATION FOR OUR OFFICERS WHEN CONFRONTING THE SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE. AB THREE NINETY TWO SETS OUT TO CREATE A NECESSARY STANDARD BEFORE AN OFFICER CAN USE DEADLY FORCE AS DEFINED NECESSARY MEANS THERE WAS NO REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE. TO DEADLY FORCE THE PROBLEM IS THE STANDARD WOULD BE APPLIED IN HINDSIGHT WHEN JUDGING AN OFFICER'S ACTIONS IN THOSE SPLIT SECOND. DECISION MAKING PROCESS AB THREE NINETY TWO IS NOT A NECESSARY STANDARD AB THREE NINETY TWO IS AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD. OFFICERS ARE OFTEN FORCED TO MAKE SPLIT SECOND JUDGMENTS IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE TENSE UNCERTAIN AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING. AB THREE NINETY TWO WOULD REQUIRE SUPER HUMAN DECISION MAKING THAT IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE. STATISTICALLY MOST POLICE SHOOTINGS USUALLY ARISE OUT OF OFFICERS RESPONDING TO UNEVENTFUL SITUATIONS AS HANDLING BURGLARIES ARE DISTURBANCES. INCIDENTS FROM START TO FINISH ARE VERY TIME COMPRESSED WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OCCURRING UNDER THREE SECONDS. OFFICERS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES IN TWO TO THREE SECONDS WHEN CONFRONTING A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW NOT ONLY WILL IT NOT CHANGE OUTCOMES IN IN DANGER LAW ENFORCEMENT. EXPERTS HAVE SAID IT WILL LEAD TO LESS PROACTIVE POLICING FURTHER EXACERBATE RECRUITING AND RETENTION ISSUES AND LEAD TO LESS QUALIFIED TRAINEES AT THE ACADEMY. OFFICERS WILL NOT WANT TO DO THIS JOB KNOWING THAT WHEN THEY GET CALLED INTO A SITUATION TO HAVE TO MAKE A LIFE OR DEATH DECISION. THEY WILL BE PROSECUTED CIVIL ACTION TAKEN AGAINST HER DEPARTMENT AND THEIR ENTIRE CAREER SAVAGE BY THE PRESS THEY WILL SIMPLY WALK AWAY. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER TODAY. AND I WOULD ASK DOCTOR WEBER RESPECTFULLY TO COMMIT TO WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND TRY TO REACH A COMPROMISE. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. AND CAN YOU HAVE TO WITNESSES YOU HAVE. TEN MINUTES. ONCE I FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK THIS AGAIN. MY NAME IS JULIE ROBERTSON AND I'M A DEPUTY SHERIFF FOR THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MY PARTNER MARK SAUCE YOU. AND I WERE DISPATCHED TO A CUSTOMER DISTURBANCE AT A LOCAL AUTO STORE. WHERE STORE CLERK AND I WERE SHOT MARK WAS SHOT AND KILLED? THERE IS NO INDICATION PRIOR TO OUR ARRIVAL AND DURING OUR BRIEF CONTACT FOR THE SUBJECT INVOLVED THAT HE WAS ARMED. WITHIN TEN SECONDS OF ARRIVING AT THE STORE THE SUBJECT BEGAN SHOOTING AT US. MARK REACTED BY ATTEMPTING TO FIND COVER. AS HE WAS FINDING COVER THE GUNMEN CONTINUED TO FIRE AT MARK WHILE CHASING HIM RESULTING IN MARK'S ALMOST IMMEDIATE DEATH. AFTER MARK HAD FALLEN THE GUNMAN TURNED TOWARD ME AND BEGAN FIRING. A VOLLEY OF GUNFIRE BETWEEN ME AND THE GUNMEN FOLLOWED. HE LEFT THE STORE AND FLANK ME FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE ENTRANCE DOOR. HE PROCEEDED TO SHOOT ME AGAIN TO FINISH WHAT HE STARTED. AT ONE POINT DURING THE FIREFIGHT THE GUNMEN BEGAN SHOOTING WITH ONLY IS BACK EXPOSED TO BE. I RECALL THAT MOMENT THINKING THAT IF I WERE TO SHOOT HIM IN THE BACK. I WOULD BE THE NEXT OFFICER IN THE NEWS BEING SCRUTINIZED FOR MY ACTIONS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE JUST MURDERED MY PARTNER SHOT ONE STORE CLERKS AND ALSO SHOT ME. I WAS FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE AND FIGHTING TO PROTECT COMPLETE STRANGERS AS I CHOSE TO STAND BETWEEN THE GUNMAN EMPLOYEES AND PATRONS. THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO SECOND GUESS MY ACTIONS IN THAT MOMENT IS FRIGHTENING. I STILL HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO RETURN A PATROL AND MARKS HONOR. BUT THIS BILL MAKES ME WONDER SACRIFICING EVERYTHING IS WORTH IT. BY THE SOUNDS OF IT THE ONLY OPTIONS GIVEN TO ME IF HANDED A SIMILAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES ARE TO DIE. BE CRIMINALLY CHARGED FOR LIVE WITH THE BLOOD OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN MY HANDS. ON THAT DAY MY WORST NIGHTMARE BECAME REALITY I LEFT FACING THE FEAR FALLING ASLEEP EACH NIGHT ONLY TO RELIVE THE ENDLESS LOOP OF MY FRIEND MARK'S MURDER. FEELINGS OF HELPLESSNESS LONELINESS AND DESPAIR CONSTANTLY FLOOD MY THOUGHTS. KNOWING I WOULD MORE THAN LIKELY DIE THAT DAY MY ONLY CONCERN WAS TO DIE ALONGSIDE MARK. I SHIELDED HIM WITH MY BODY IS MY LAST ATTEMPT TO PROTECT HIM. I KNOW HOW TO LIVE WITH MARKS BLOOD ON MY HANDS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. MY ACTIONS THAT THEY WERE PURELY REACTIONARY AND MY SURVIVAL INSTINCTS KICKED IN. TIME WAS ON MY SIDE AND I WAS NOT AFFORDED THE LUXURY OF BEING ABLE TO WEIGH MY OPTIONS BEFORE REACTING. HAD THIS BILL BEEN AFFECT I WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RETREAT TO AVOID BEING KILLED OR IMPRISONED. INSTEAD OF RETREATING I STOOD MY GROUND AND FOUGHT TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF THOSE STILL INSIDE THE STORE. MY ONLY INTENTION IS TO PROTECT AND SAVE LIVES HOW IS IT THAT I WOULD BE QUESTIONS AND JUDGED BY THE ONES WHO LIVE SO DISTANT FROM THE DANGERS WE INHERENTLY FACE EACH DAY. MARK SACRIFICE EVERYTHING I'M WILLING TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING BUT THIS BILL WOULD TIE OUR HANDS BEHIND OUR BACKS. HOW MY ABLE TO PROTECT AND SERVE THE COMMUNITY KNOWING THAT I WOULD BE CRIMINALIZED IN DEMONIZED FOR MYSELF THE SECTIONS? TO MARK I'M SORRY FAILED TO PROTECT YOU. IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY BRING HOME SAFELY TO YOUR FAMILY IT WAS AN HONOR TO HAVE SERVED ALONGSIDE YOU AND I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER PARTNER. I'M ONLY HERE TODAY BECAUSE YOU SACRIFICE EVERYTHING I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU BROTHER. THANK YOU SH. RESPECT PLEASE [inaudible] YES MA'AM. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KATHLEEN MISTAKENLY STORM I'M A UNION SIDE LAWYER REPRESENTING THE RIGHTS OF PEACE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS A MOTHER AND A LAWYER I'M CONCERNED WITH THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE PRESERVATION OF ALL HUMAN LIFE. THE PROTECTION OF PEACE OFFICER SAFETY AND EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. IT IS NO SMALL TASK TO BALANCE THESE DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND THERE WERE THE OF STATEWIDE DISCUSSION. HOWEVER AB THREE NINETY TO HIS PROPOSED CHANGES DO NOT EIGHT AND STRIKING THAT BALANCE. RATHER THEY CRIMINALIZE POLICE USE OF FORCE. AND INCENTIVIZE DISENGAGEMENT THROUGH CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. THIS TIPS THE BALANCE I NECESSARILY JEOPARDIZING PUBLIC SAFETY. THE PROPOSED CHANGES ARE PREDICATED ON THE FALSE NARRATIVE THE CURRENT LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS. RIGHT OFFICERS TO USE DEADLY FORCE. UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE DEADLY FORCE IS NOT NECESSARY. IN REALITY THE COURTS HAVE LONG HELD THAT OFFICERS ME ONLY USE NECESSARY FORCE. THE ISSUE THEN TURNS ON HOW NECESSARY IS DEFINED. AB THREE NINETY TWO SIX TO REDEFINE NECESSARY. SUCH THAT THERE IS NO REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. IF TRUSTS THE ANALYSIS FROM OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE STANDARD. TO AN AFTER THE FACT SUBJECTIVE STANDARD WITH THE BENEFIT OF TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT. THE NECESSARY STANDARDS A HARDENED CRUX OF THIS BILL I'M GOING TO DRESS THOSE CONCERNS FIRST. AS I SAID NECESSARY HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE STANDARD. IN A PINE AND OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE STANDARD THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ENGRAM VERSUS CONOR HELD. THE REASONABLENESS OF A PARTICULAR USE OF FORCE MUST BE JUDGED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A REASONABLE OFFICER ON THE SCENE. AND IT'S CALCULUS MUST EMBODY AN ALLOWANCE FOR THE FACT THAT POLICE OFFICERS ARE OFTEN FORCED. TO MAKE SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FORCE NECESSARY IN A PARTICULAR SITUATION. THE PURPOSE OF AB THREE NINETY TWO IS A RADICALLY ALTER THE STANDARD BY WHICH THE COURT WILL DETERMINE NECESSITY. MY OVERRIDING THE SUPREME COURT'S OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE STANDARD. THE NEW SUBJECTIVE STANDARD FOR DETERMINIST SB WOULD BE CREATED AND OFFICERS WOULD BE DENIED SELF DEFENSE RIGHTS. IF IN RETROSPECT ANY OTHER LESSER COURSE OF ACTION WAS A POSSIBILITY. THIS CREATES AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD AND REPRESENTS THE EPITOME OF SECOND GUESSING. NECESSITY WOULD BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS WITH THE BENEFIT OF TRANQUILITY TIME IN HINDSIGHT. THE REAL WORLD SITUATIONS WHERE DEADLY FORCE IS WERE IS USED REQUIRE OFFICERS TO MAKE SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS. WITHOUT THE LUXURIES OF TIME TRANQUILITY AND HINDSIGHT. OUR NINTH CIRCUIT HAS ALREADY YOU HELD EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWOS DEFINITION OF NECESSARY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. RECOGNIZING THE REQUIRING OFFICERS TO DETERMINE THE LEAST INTRUSIVE TACTICS. WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO EXERCISE SUPER HUMAN JUDGMENT. WHEN LIVES HANG IN THE BALANCE OFFICERS MUST ACT WITHIN THAT RANGE OF CONDUCT BUT AS OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE? THIS BILL STANDARD FOR EVALUATING THE REASONABLENESS OF DEADLY FORCE PROVIDES NO DEFERENCE TO RESERVE OFFICERS OFTEN SPLIT SECOND EVALUATION OF WEATHER LESSER FORCE. IS AS SAFE OR AS EFFECTIVE. NECESSITY BE REDEFINED INTO SUBJECTIVE INQUIRY INTO WHETHER THE OFFICER FAILED TO EMPLOY A HYPOTHETICAL ALTERNATIVE. THIS HINDSIGHT ANALYSIS HAS BEEN EXPRESSLY REJECTED BY THE COURTS. ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE. THIS BILL PROPOSES AN INFERIOR RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. VIOLATING EQUAL PROTECTIONS GUARANTEES OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO EFFECTIVELY STRIPS OFFICERS THEIR RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE IF THEY COULD HAVE USED ANY REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE INCLUDING RETREATING. THE SANCTITY OF LIFE PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO EVERYONE SUSPECTS VICTIMS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. BUT THE NO REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE CENTER IS NOT POSSIBLE. IF FORCED IT FORCES THE ANALYSIS OF DEADLY FORCE FROM OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. TO AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL HINDSIGHT ANALYSIS. INVITING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO RESTORALAX FOR STRANGERS TO BE SECOND GUESSED AND PROSECUTED. IF ANY HIRED EXPERT CAN CONJURE AN ALTERNATIVE. THEY'RE ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN FACE AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES NOW BEING ASKED TO EXERCISE DEEPER HUMAN JUDGMENT. PLEASE VOTE NOW THANK YOU Q.. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOW OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT WOULD ALLOW FOR US IS NOW. AND THERE WERE GET COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC ME TOO FROM PUBLIC SO. BACK AT CAMP. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER FOR BRINGING THIS DISCUSSION TO ASK THANK YOU TO BOTH SIDES. FOR PRESENTING YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM EVERYBODY IS THE VALUE OF THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON EACH OF US TO LOOK AT THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE OUT ON THE STREETS EVERY DAY. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE CASES THAT WERE DISCUSSED. IS THAT THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO FAR IN ONE DIRECTION SUCH THAT WE AREN'T PROTECTING. AND HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO ARE TAKING LIFE FROM OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE TEXT OF THIS LANGUAGE SWINGS THE PENDULUM TOO FAR IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. BECAUSE THE SANCTITY OF THE LIFE OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT. WE ASK THEM EVERY DAY TO GO OUT AND PROTECT US AND SERVICE THEY TAKE OATHS TO DO JUST THAT. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL THAT WE PASSED THROUGH THIS BODY. DRAWS THE CORRECT BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO CONCERNS. AS I READ THE BILL -- I DON'T KNOW THAT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE OPPOSITION IS SAID ABOUT IT BUT I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN SECTIONS ONE NINETY SIX AND EIGHT THIRTY FIVE AND HOW THAT WOULD BE CONSTRUED BY COURT. I'VE CONCERNS ABOUT SECTION A FOR AND WHETHER THAT GOES TOO FAR IN THE WRONG DIRECTION -- BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION IS TO CONTINUE BECAUSE CLEARLY THE BALANCES OFF RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE LOSING LIVES UNNECESSARILY AND PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT DOCTOR ABROAD LIKE TO ASK YOU -- I'D LIKE TO ENSURE YOU'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION MOVING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THIS BILL HITS THE FLOOR WE DO HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY AWARE -- I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE NEW HERE BUT PROBABLY WHERE THE WE SPENT THE LAST YEAR WORKING ON REACHING OF SOME TYPE OF COMPROMISE AND WE WILL COMMITTED TO DOING THAT NOT ONLY ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT I MEAN WE'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE -- THE END OF LAST SESSION WHICH WAS IN SEPTEMBER -- DILIGENTLY AND DID NOT IMMEDIATELY INTRODUCED THE BILL BECAUSE WE WERE WORKING AND HELPING TO BRING A COMPROMISE SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT -- AND AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE HOPE THAT THERE'S ALSO SIMILAR COMMITMENT ON BOTH SIDES WE KNOW THERE HAS TO BE A COMING TOGETHER OF TWO SITES AND WATER -- TO ROBERT SOME CONCLUSIONS THAT'S NECESSARY -- SO WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO HAVING A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. AND THAT DOES PROVIDE A BALANCE THIS IS NOT A A BILL IF YOU LOOK AT IT CAREFULLY AS YOU LISTEN TO THE OFFICERS AND THOSE WHO ARE. SPEAKING OUT IN SUPPORT OF IT IT'S NOT A BILL DESIGNED TO MAKE ANYBODY'S UNSAFE. IT'S DESIGNED TO MAKE ALL OF US SAFE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT IN OTHER AREAS AS INDICATED THAT IT DOES DO THAT. UNTIL WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TRY TO REACH SOME COMPROMISE BEFORE THIS GOES TO THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. AND THEN AS YOU KNOW I HAVE SPENT MANY. HOURS READING. AND DISCUSSING THIS WITH ALSO HAS -- I THINK THE VOTE ON THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM. THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE LOSS OF LIVES. IN THEIR OWN LIFE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AND I KNOW WE'RE ALL COMMITTED. INCLUDING YOU DOCTOR EVER TO MAKING SURE THAT LIVES ARE PROTECTED SO -- I THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMITMENT AND YOU KNOW I AND VOTING TODAY TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION BOARD I LOOK FOR TO SING A BILL THAT IS. A LITTLE BIT CLEARER TO ME ON THE FLOOR AND THAT -- STRIKES THAT NECESSARY NESS PROTECTS HUMAN LIFE ON ALL SIDES AND DOES WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE QUIRK SHOW ON NOT NEARLY. I'VE BEEN HERE SIX YEARS ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND I VERY MUCH AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN ALL OF HER COMMENTS -- AND I THINK THEY WERE VERY WELL PUT SO I WILL NOT REPEAT THEM THAT I HAVE THE SAME RESERVATIONS I WILL. VOTE -- TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD FOR NEGOTIATION ON THE FLOOR BUT I CANNOT VOTE FOR DENTS CURRENT FORM. THANK YOU I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WHEN I'VE MY COMMENTS WAS THAT SHE WAS NEW AND HAD NO REFERENCE TO EXPERIENCE BY WAS THE FACT THAT SHE WAS NOT HERE WHEN WE WERE BRINGING THE BILL FOR WHAT LAST YEAR. AND THAT THE WORK THAT PUT WENT INTO IT FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR AS WELL AS OUR COMMITMENT AT THE END OF LAST SESSION TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SO THAT WAS MY ONLY COMMENT WAS WAS THAT. AIMED AT THE FACT THAT OF THOSE WHO WERE HERE KNEW HOW MUCH WORK WE DID THERE SEVERAL OF YOU WERE NEW BUT KNOW HOW MUCH WORK WE DEAL WITH. NINE THREE ONE AND AND WE CONTINUED AND MADE A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE A CONVERSATION AT THE END OF LAST SESSION. MISS WICKS AND MS COMATOSE. THANKS THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK -- THE AUTHORS DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOURTH AND CONTINUING. THE CONVERSATION OVER THE YEAR PLUS YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- AND FOR THE WITNESSES WHO -- HAVE TESTIFIED TODAY ON BOTH SIDES -- I ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND IF I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE. FOLKS WHO ARE. DOING THE BEST IN THE SITUATION THAT THEY'RE IN AND THEY ARE OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND HUSBANDS AND WIVES THEY'RE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFECTIVE PLACINGS BUILT ON TRUST. AND IN FAR TOO MANY COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY BLACK BLACK AND BROWN COMMITTEES THAT TRUSSES BEEN LOST. AND I I BELIEVE WHAT THIS CONVERSATION IS RAISING IS. A CONVERSATION AROUND SOME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS. SOME UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT BROWN AND BLACK FOLKS BROWN AND BLACK MEN. ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY KILLED AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. STEP AN IMPORTANT BILL -- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK -- DEPUTY CHIEF NOBLE. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEAR IS. LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TRAINING BUT WE DON'T NEED ENFORCEABLE STANDARDS THE ENFORCEABLE STANDARDS OF NECESSARY FORCE IN AB. THREE NINETY TWO CAN YOU TALK DIRECTLY ABOUT WHY YOU THINK THAT CHANGE IN USE OF FORCE POLICY THAT LANGUAGE. IS CRITICAL FOR THIS BILL. I'M SORRY I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT POLICE OFFICERS NEED TRAINING IN THE MORE TRAINING GIVE OUR POLICE OFFICERS THE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION CONCLUSION OF THE THAT IS. THE REASON WHY THERE NEEDS TO BE A BILL LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSEQUENCES AND ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THAT VERY VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OFFICERS WHO ABANDON THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES WHO STAND IN FRONT OF A CAR INSTEAD AND USE DEADLY FORCE RATHER THAN TAKING A STEP TO THE SIDE. WHO CREATE DANGER -- DUE TO RECKLESS TACTICS THIS IS NOT ABOUT SITUATIONS WHERE AN OFFICER IS CONFRONTED WITH A SPLIT SECOND DECISION. IN THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE TRULY CONFRONTED WITH A SPLIT SECOND DECISION DEFERENCE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE DECISION MAKING OF THE OFFICER. BUT MANY SITUATIONS THE VAST MAJORITY TO SITUATIONS I WOULD ARGUE EVOLVED OVER TIME WHAT TACTICS AND DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES MAY BE USED. TO TO ATTEMPT TO LOWER. THE THE THE RUB IS AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT EVEN WITH DE ESCALATION THAT'S NOT A FAIL SAFE. AND IF AN OFFICER STILL NEEDS TO USE FORCE IMMEDIATELY NEEDS TO USE FORCE. THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY USE FORCE AND WE SHOULD HAVE ROAD OFFICERS LIKE THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO SPOKE TO THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE WHO IS ABSOLUTELY WHO WROTE. WHO WHO ANSWERED THE CALL TO SERVE AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY -- AND SUFFERED THIS INCREDIBLE TRAGEDY THIS IS WHAT WE WANT WE WANT YOUNG HEROES LIKE THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS UP UP TESTIFYING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS OFFICERS WHO ABANDON THEIR TRAINING WHO ABANDON THEIR COMMON SENSE IN BAND THEIR THEIR DECISION MAKING AND IT RESULTS IN IN THE LOSS OF LIFE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT LOOK THAT CONTEXT ON THE OTHER THING THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT IS YOU KNOW ASKING THAT. AND THE IDEA OF SORT OF REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED. WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM FROM OPPOSITION THAT OFFICERS WOULD HAVE TO MAKE -- DECISIONS AND SPLIT SECOND -- AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR ABILITY TO KIND OF RUN THROUGH A CHECKLIST OF OPTIONS BEFORE USING FORCE THERE BY PUTTING THEMSELVES IN DANGER. CAN YOU SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THAT. WHY ABSOLUTELY AGREE WE DON'T GIVE OFFICERS A CHECKLIST AYE AYE I TALK ABOUT THEM IN MY STATEMENT IS THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE OFFICERS THEY CAN'T MAKE A PHONE CALL THEY CAN'T REFER TO A MANUAL THEY CAN'T CALL SUPERVISOR? THEY HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND THAT'S WHERE THEIR TRAINING -- COMES INTO PLAY IS NOT JUST CLASSROOM TRAINING BUT IS SIMULATION TRAINING -- THESE DISCUSSIONS IS PRACTICED -- I DON'T EXPECT PERFECT DECISIONS I EXPECT DECISIONS TO FALL WITHIN A REASONABLE RANGE BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IS THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO IN THAT INDIVIDUAL OFFICER AT THE MOMENT THAT THEY USE THE FORCE. NOT IT WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE OFFICER KNEW NOT WHAT WE LOOK WE MAY LEARN LATER ON AND WITH TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT IS NOT. A PASS FOR ALL DECISIONS THAT POLICE OFFICERS MAKE WE ABSOLUTELY REVIEW POLICE OFFICER JUST IS MAKING WE REVIEW IT WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINE TRAINING WE REVIEW IN THE CIVIL COURSE ALL THE TIME -- SO POLICE DECISION MAKING IS REVIEWED IT SHOULD BE REVIEW OF ALL -- AND THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT WITHOUT LOOKING AT IN HINDSIGHT AND SO IN YOUR OPINION THIS BILL WILL NOT PUT OFFICERS IN HARM'S WAY. NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO THANK YOU. IT'S DOCTOR WEBER IT'S MY COMMITTEE. TALK TO WEBER. NO I WAS JUST WONDERING I DON'T KNOW IF THE OTHER OFFICER SHE ASKED HIM TO THE QUESTIONS AND SHE HAD ANYTHING TO ADD TO IT BUT WE CAN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU SO WHAT I KNOW IS THAT MAKING SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS OR INHERENT TO POLICE WORK -- IF SINCE WE'RE COMMON EVERYONE WOULD HAVE IT AND I SAID IN MY STATEMENT THAT NOT EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO BE THE POLICE SOULD BE AND SO CERTAINLY WE WANT TO HIRE OFFICERS. PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO CAN MAKE THOSE SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANYTHING EXTRA FOR AN OFFICER IN A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION MUCH LIKE WHAT IT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO DO IF I COMMIT A TRAFFIC STOP. I'VE GOT TO DECIDE REALLY QUICK WHERE I WANT TO STOP YOU WHEN I'M GOING TO ACTIVATE MY LIGHTS WHEN I'M GOING TO CONTACT. MY ARE TO YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND LET THEM KNOW WHERE WE ARE HOW I'M GOING TO POSITION MY VEHICLE SO THAT I'M SAFE AS I APPROACH YOU IN YOU IF I HAVE YOU GET OUT ALL OF THESE THINGS I HAVE TO DO. FAIRLY QUICKLY MUCH LIKE THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT OFFICERS ARE USING DEADLY FORCE AS A FIRST RESORT WHEN THEYCAN'T CATCH SOMEONE WHEN SOMEONE IS FAILING TO COMPLY. AS OPPOSED TO A LAST RESORT WHICH IS WHAT OFFICERS ARE TAUGHT TO DO AFTER YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND NONE OF THAT HAS WORKED IN YOU CAN GET TO THAT. IN A MATTER OF SECONDS BUT YOU'RE ONLY TO USE DEADLY FORCE AFTER YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'VE BEEN TRAINED TAUGHT AND NO TO DO. AND THEN THERE NEED TO BE SOME REASONABLENESS WITH REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS THAT ARE FIRED BECAUSE ON THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT WE ARE TAUGHT. FIRED TWO ROUNDS IN RAPID SUCCESSION RE ASSESS THE THREAT BEFORE YOU FIRE IN THE CASE OF STEFAN CLARK EIGHTEEN MORE. THAN HELPFUL THANK YOU AND NEXT MUST COME LIKE A DOVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND THANK YOU. DOCTOR WEBER. FOR BRINGING THIS -- VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO THE TABLE REPEATEDLY -- YOU KNOW AS I SEE IT THIS. BILL KIND OF RE STATES WHAT THE STANDARD SHOULD BE RIGHT AND I ACTUALLY WISH WE COULD BE IN A PLACE WHERE WE COULD BE REPEALING. THIS KIND. OF BELL RATHER THAN TALKING ABOUT GETTING IT PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. BUT WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET. AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE NOT THERE YET IS BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO SEE. AND READ ABOUT SO MANY KILLINGS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING BLACKS BROWN PEOPLE THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND THOSE WHO ARE POOR. AND THE TRAUMA THAT COMES FROM SEEING THAT REPEATEDLY. MAKES PEOPLE BEGIN TO QUESTION THEIR OWN SAFETY. AND THEIR OWN RIGHT TO LIFE. AND WHEN THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN YOU ARE FORCED TO YOU SHOULD BE FORCED TO HAVE. THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS. I I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT -- THAT TAXED AM THAT I HOPE ALL SIDES -- CAN ANSWER BUT I DO ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT -- WE NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE SHOULDN'T WANT TO BE CRIMINALIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I WOULD ACTUALLY ADD THAT -- OUR CIVIL SOCIETY IS ACTUALLY PREDICATED. ON HAVING LAW AND ORDER AND HAVING POLICE OFFICERS THAT WE CAN TRUST THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE INCARCERATED I THINK WHEN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN. YOU ACTUALLY BEGIN TO DISINTEGRATE THE FABRIC OF OUR CIVIL SOCIETY. SO TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW IN TWENTY NINETEEN SUGGESTS WE ARE AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE. ABOUT HOW OUR SOCIETY IS OPERATING. I'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF YOU ALL TALK ABOUT CRIMINALIZING USE OF FORCE AND SO I JUST NEEDED SOME CLARIFICATION ON MY END ARE THERE ACTUAL ACTUAL PENALTIES PRESCRIBED. IN THIS BILL IF AN OFFICER USES DEADLY FORCE I DIDN'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT AN OFFICER BEING CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR OR AN OFFICER BEING CHARGED WITH A FELONY. SO MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING BUT ARE THERE ARE PENALTIES THAT WOULD BE PRESCRIBED. THANK YOU OUT OF THE RING WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA THERE NOTE -- NEW PENALTIES -- ADDED NO NEW CRIMES TO FIND -- BY THIS BILL THIS BILL MODIFIES -- THE SECTION OF THE PENAL CODE ONE NINETY SIX WHICH PROVIDES THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE OF JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE. BY A PEACE OFFICER -- AND MAKES CLEAR THAT PEACEOFFICERS HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM THE SAME JUSTIFICATION OF SELF DEFENSE AVAILABLE TO ANY PERSON IN CALIFORNIA -- WHEN THEY'RE UNDER AN IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR ACTING TO DEFEND ANOTHER PERSON? AGAINST AN IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY AND IN ADDITION GIVES PEACE OFFICERS -- AN ADDITIONAL DEFENSE -- IF UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ACT TO DATE KILL AN INDIVIDUAL -- WHO IS FLEEING -- WHERE THEY HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON -- HAS COMMITTED A VIOLENT FELONY AND WOULD POSE A THREAT OF DEATH. OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO OTHERS -- IF NOT IMMEDIATELY APPREHENDED EVEN IF THEY DON'T POSE AN IMMINENT THREAT AT THE MOMENT. AND SO THE REALITY IS THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS DID OCCUR IT THE YOUNGEST WOULD STILL BE ON THE DA'S OFFICE TO ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE IN CHARGE. RIGHT AND WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A VERY STRONG COHESIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN D. A.'S AND LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT SO. I AM VERY I'M BEGGING IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION MAYBE I KNOW BUT PLEASE SHARE YES. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT IT IS STILL UP TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY ON TO INVESTIGATE TO MAKE FACTUAL DETERMINATIONS AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. ON BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND TO MAKE A DECISION AND THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS DISCRETION ABOUT WHETHER TO CHARGE OR NOT. AND THEN -- IN FACT IN THE SECTION THAT TALKS ABOUT THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES -- I READ THAT. OR MAYBE IT'S MY INTERPRETATION THAT IT STILL IS GIVING -- IT BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THE BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO OUR PROCEED BY THE OFFICER AT THAT TIME SO I READ THAT IS STILL GIVING QUITE A BIT OF DISCRETION VISIONS. AND SO AM I MISINTERPRETING SOMETHING BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD FROM YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT IT WILL LIMIT. OF POLICE OFFICERS ABILITY TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOB WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO SO -- AND I THINK ALL FOLKS AT THE DíAS. AT THE TABLE SHOULD FEEL FREE TO SHARE. BUT DOES IT STILL GIVES. POLICE OFFICERS THE DISCRETION TO DO THEIR WORK AND MAKE THOSE KINDS OF QUICK JUDGMENT. UP I CAN I CAN START SAY BRIEFLY I BELIEVE ABSOLUTELY SO AND IN PARTICULAR. THE DEFINITION OF TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IS EXPLICIT THAT IT MEANS ALL FACTS. ARE KNOWN TO THE PEACE OFFICER AT THE TIME SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT JUDGING IN HINDSIGHT THIS IS NOT ABOUT JUDGING AN OFFICER BASED ON FACTS. THAT ARE UNCOVERED IN THE INVESTIGATION LATER IF AN OFFICER RESPONSE TO SOMEBODY -- POINTING A GUN AT THEM AND WILL IT IS LATER DISCOVERED THAT THAT GUN IS UNLOADED OR IS A REPLICA. THOUGH THE FACT THAT IT IS UNLOADED OUR REPLICA THAT WAS NOT KNOWN TO THE OFFICER AT THE TIME IS NOT PART OF THE CALCULUS OF JUDGING WHETHER THE THE USE OF FORCE -- WAS REASONABLE IT IS BASED ON THE FACTS KNOWN TO THE OFFICER AT THE TIME AND IN FACT NOT ONLY IS IT EXPLICIT IN A LANGUAGE BUT ALSO IN THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS IN EIGHT THIRTY FIVE A SUBSECTION A IT IS CLEAR -- THAT -- IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BILL DOES NOT INTEND TO SUBJECT OFFICERS TO JUDGE OFFICERS ACTION IN HINDSIGHT. I'M FIRST I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO YOUR INITIAL QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL MANDATES A PARTICULAR CHARGE AND I DISAGREE -- WITH THE GENTLEMAN STATEMENTS. THE BILL HAS PROPOSED. TAKES AWAY THE DEFENSE OF JUST WHILE HOMICIDE FROM AN OFFICER IF THEIR TACTICAL CONNECTING DECISION MAKING UP TO THE USE OF FORCE. IS DETERMINED TO OF BAD CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT I THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS IN THAT CASE OFFICER WILL ONLY HAVE DEFENSE WHAT WILL BE EXCUSE ME WILL NOT HAVE THAT -- FROM A DEFENSE FOR JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE AND WILL FACE A MANSLAUGHTER PROSECUTION. THIS IS BEEN EXPRESSLY REPUDIATED. BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES VERSES MENDEZ -- IT IS BEEN VERY CLEARLY ARTICULATED BY THE HIGHEST COURT IN THIS COUNTRY INDEPENDENT ACCESS -- VIOLATIONS OF THE FOURTH A MEMBER SEE THE INDEPENDENT VIOLATIONS THE FOURTH AMENDMENT NEED TO BE REVIEWED SEPARATELY IN DISTINCT FROM ANY USE OF FORCE AND JUST BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE COMMITTED A SEPARATE FOURTH MY MY VIOLATION. IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING A JUSTIFIABLE USE OF FORCE YOU CANNOT LOSE YOUR DEFENSE OF SELF DEFENSE BECAUSE OF THAT INITIAL VIOLATION OF SOMEBODY'S FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS -- IN REGARDS TO YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TO TABI OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD MOVE THE MOVE THE ANALYSIS FROM -- OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE STANDARDS TO A SUBJECTIVE I AGAIN I DISAGREE -- THAT THIS IS STILL LOOKING AT IT FROM OFFICERS PERSPECTIVE AT THAT TIME IT VERY CLEARLY IS ASKING. FOR A HOST OF EXPERTS TO COME UP OUT OF THE WOODWORK AND TRY TO CONJURE UP ANY ALTERNATIVE. OTHER THAN THE DEADLY USE OF FORCE IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS TO LOOK AT TIME DISTANCE COVER TACTICAL REPOSITIONING. WHICH IS NOTHING SHORT OF RETREATING BUT BY ANOTHER WORD AND IT'S ASKED TO BE REVIEWED FROM THE COMFORTS OF A BUILDING LIKE THIS FROM A NICE CHAIR SITTING AT A TABLE REVIEWING A VIDEO SLOWING IT DOWN LOOKING FRAME BY FRAME. NOT BY SOMEBODY -- NOT NOT BY THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEBODY LIKE JULIE ROBERTS SAYING WHO'S IN THE FIGHT OF HER LIFE WATCHING HER PARTNER BE MURDERED TRYING TO DEFEND [inaudible] DEFEND -- BY INNOCENT CIVILIAN BY STANDARDS AND SO YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THE ANALYSIS AT THE OBJECTIVE REASONABLE OFFICERS PERSPECTIVE AT THE TIME TAKING INTO WHAT THE OFFICER. KNOWS AND ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT THEY'RE IN A RAPIDLY EVOLVING SITUATION NOT LOOKING AT THIS LATER TO SEE -- WELL SHOOT THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT THAT WAS JUST A NERF GUN OR NOT A REAL GUN OR THEY SHOULD OF YOU KNOW. GOING BACK TO THEIR CAR AND RETREATED IT'S IT'S UNREASONABLE AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND IN FACT IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT. CASE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR SCOTT BEHIND RIGHT THE COURT EXPRESSLY REJECTED THIS HINDSIGHT SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS. AND SAID THAT TO REQUIRE OFFICERS TO LEE USE THE LEAST INTRUSIVE MEANS AND THE LEAST INTRUSIVE MEANS ONLY. REQUIRE SUPER HUMAN JUDGMENT AND IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS. KAMLAGER-DOVE -- I'D LIKE TO RESPOND AS HAVING BEEN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN PATROL FOR TWENTY YEARS BOTH AS AN OFFICER AND A SUPERVISOR. AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I FEEL NO RESTRAINT ABOUT MY SAFETY IN TERMS OF HOW I RESPOND TO SUSPECTS WHO OFTEN RAN FOR ME. AS A FEMALE OFFICER WHO AWARD HAPPY ABOUT THE SERVICE THAT I WAS PROVIDING AT THAT TIME AND DURING MY TWENTY YEARS -- I WORKED SOUTH BUREAU CRASH COMMUNITY RESOURCES AGAINST GANGS. I WAS INVOLVED IN DEALING WITH VIOLENT CRIMINALS ON A DAILY BASIS I SHOT NO ONE I HAD SUSPECTS RUN FROM ME FIGHT ME CURSE ME I SHOT NO. ONE AND SO AS A POLICE OFFICER YOU'RE REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON YOUR TRAINING AND SOMETIMES YOUR TRAINING MEANS BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GAIN COMPLIANCE SOMETIME THAT TRAINING MEANS. I'VE GOT TO CHASE YOU AND RALPH SO WITH YOU TO GET YOU WENT TO CONTROL BUT WHAT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO DO IS IF YOU ARE PROFANE IF YOU ARE NOT COMPLYING IS PUNISH YOU. BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SHOOT YOU BECAUSE I CAN'T CATCH YOU I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SHOP TO CHOKE YOU TO DEATH BECAUSE YOU WON'T TURN AROUND AND SO AS A POLICE OFFICER I CAN TELL YOU FOR TWENTY YEARS. I DID THAT JOB AND I DID IT FACING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE AND I FELT NO CONSTRAINT IN TERMS OF HOW I COMPORTED MYSELF. DAY TO DAY I DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT I DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK ANYBODY I DIDN'T CALL THE LAN LINE AND ASK MY WATCH COMMANDER I RELIED ON MY TRAINING. AND I DID WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO EXPECTED TO DO REQUIRED TO DO AND I'M NOT SUPERHUMAN YOU SEE ME I'M JUST A GIRL. WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OUTBURSTS. PLEASE. I WANTED TO RESPOND NEARLY TO THE QUESTION OF THE ON CONSTITUTIONALITY AND JUST SAY THAT THAT IS. PLAINLY NOT THE CASE ON THE IDEA THAT THIS BILL IS IN ANY WAY UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT IS. TRUE THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS SET A LOWER STANDARD FOR POLICE USE OF DEADLY FORCE WHEN IT IS ADDRESSING WHETHER THAT USE OF FORCE VIOLATE INDIVIDUALS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THAN THIS BILL WOULD SET FORTH BUT NOTHING -- IN THAT OPINION IN ANY OF THEIR JURISPRUDENCE SUGGEST THAT OFFICERS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO KILL PEOPLE AND NOTHING -- PREVENTS THIS BODY FROM SETTING CALIFORNIA LAW -- TO BE A HIGHER STANDARD -- FOR THE USE OF POLICE DEADLY FORCE THAN THE U. S. CONSTITUTION ONE THAT IS IN LINE WITH BEST PRACTICES -- AGENCIES -- AND PROGRESSIVE AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY I'M AND I ALSO JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY SAY. THE BILL EXPRESSLY -- THE THE THE WITNESS -- POINTED OUT. TO WE TALKED ABOUT THE OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE OFFICER STANDARD WHICH THIS BILL EXPRESSLY INCORPORATES IT DEFINES NECESSARY. AS GIVEN THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AN OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE OFFICER WOULD IN THE SITUATION WOULD CONCLUDE THAT THERE WAS NO REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE. THESE ALL THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS BILL APPROACH IS EVALUATING USE OF FORCE IS THE SAME REASONABLE OFFICER -- APPROACH THAT. CURRENT LAW USES IT JUST SETS THE STANDARD HIRED TO UNNECESSARY STANDARD RATHER THAN A VAGUE. WAS THE USE OF FORCE REASONABLE STANDARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO -- I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR RESPONDING TO MY QUESTIONS -- BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SINCE WE STARTED SESSION. I GUESS I COULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT EVER SINCE I MARRIED A BLACK MAN WHO HAD. WHO HAS BLACK CHILDREN -- I STILL BELIEVE THAT IT IS UP TO THE DA TO MAKE THESE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE AND IF AN OFFICER COULD WOULD BE PROSECUTED. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT REGARDLESS OF THESE SITUATIONS AFTER INCIDENTS. OF ANY KIND HAPPEN THAT OFFICERS WOULD BE HAVING DEBRIEFING SESSIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST HOW TO INCORPORATE BETTER BACK BEST PRACTICES INTO THEIR TRAINING. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IF NOTHING ELSE MISTER CHAIR -- THIS BILL IS ASKING US TO TAKE A PAUSE. ON HOW WE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. THE PUBLIC. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THE PUBLIC SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WE SHOULD BE WELCOMING THEM. AND WANTING THEM IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN OUR HOMES AND ON OUR STREETS. IF YOU MAY JUST INDULGE ME MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. I WANT TO LET YOU ALL KNOW. THAT. I'M GONNA SHARE INCIDENT. THAT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND MY POSITION ON THIS BILL. I WAS OUT DOING ERRANDS. I WAS VERY CLOSE TO HOME. MY HUSBAND CALLED ME AND SAID THE ALARM WENT OFF AT THE HOUSE ARE YOU CLOSE CAN YOU GO. I SAID YES I HAPPEN TO BE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER [inaudible] I PART I THE DOOR WAS CRACKED A LITTLE BIT AYE NGUYEN IN. I WENT IN THE HOME THERE WERE FOUR POLICE OFFICERS IN THERE WAITING FOR ME. ALL HOLDING THEIR HOLSTERS LOOKING VERY COMMON PATIENT. THREE MEN AND A WOMAN. THEY SAID WE GOT A CALL. THE BACK DOOR WAS OPEN IT WAS WINDY THE SANTA ANA WINDS. THE DOOR WAS CRACKED OPEN SO THEY CAME IN THEY CHECKED THE PERIMETER OF THE HOUSE AND THEN THEY WENT INSIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING WAS GOING ON BECAUSE THE ALARM HAD GONE OFF. I PUT DOWN MY GROCERIES. I STOOD THERE AND I LISTEN TO THEM SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH ME VERY CALMLY THEY WERE VERY RESPECTFUL. AND I NOTICED. THAT I STARTED SHAKING. I STARTED CRYING. IN MY OWN HOME. AND I REALIZED. THAT I WAS CRYING BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID. I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS. I THOUGHT MAYBE WILL I GET SHOT IN MY OWN HOME BECAUSE I DO SOMETHING. THAT MAKES THEM CONCERNED OR FEARFUL. I THOUGHT OH MY GOD WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF MY SIX FOOT THREE VERY DARK BLACK HUSBAND UNEXPECTEDLY COMES HOME TO CHECK ON ME AND THE HOUSE WELL THEY THINK HE IS AN INTRUDER. COMING AFTER ME WILL THEY SHOOT MY HUSBAND. IN MY OWN HOME QUESTIONING MY AUTHORITY [inaudible] MY PRIVACY [inaudible] MY SAFETY. I WILL ARGUE. THAT I AM A RELATIVELY YOUNG BLACK WOMAN. WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PRIVILEGE LESS THAN MANY MANY OTHERS. AND I WAS AFRAID. THAT REVEALED MY OWN TRAUMA ABOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING ABOUT THESE KINDS OF KILLINGS THAT WE SEE AND WE READ ABOUT. AND IF I AM TRAUMATIZED IN MY OWN MIDDLE CLASS HOME. THEN WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE PAIN AND THE FEAR AND THE TRAUMA. THAT COMMUNITIES BLACK BROWN ASIAN POOR MENTALLY ILL AND L. G. B. T. FACE EVERY DAY. AND WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO WORK WITH COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO SAY HOW DO WE PROTECT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HOW DO WE PROTECT COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WE CAN ALL BENEFIT FROM THE LAWS IN THE DEMOCRACY THAT WE A SPOUSE. SO IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I WILL BE URGING URGING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COME TO CONSENSUS BECAUSE THIS. ALL. MUCH MORE THAN IT SHOULD. AND AS A STEP MOTHER. I'M A YOUNG BLACK BOYS IN A BLACK GIRL. AND A HUSBAND WHO MY LOVE. ON MY ANNIVERSARY OF MY WEDDING. I DON'T WANT ANY OF US TO LIVE IN FEAR. NOT YOU NOT YOUR TEAM. AND NOT THESE COMMUNITIES RIGHT HERE. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. MR LACKEY OR MISTER DHEA THANK YOU [inaudible] I I WANNA BEGIN BY SAYING THAT -- CLEARLY WHAT. EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY IS A LOT OF DISTRUST [inaudible] THERE'S A A GREAT DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE. ON HOW WE BUILD THAT TRUST. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT. I DON'T DENY THE BAD SHOOTINGS OF HAPPENED. AND I TRULY APOLOGIZE FOR ANY POLICE MISS CONDUCTOR INJUSTICE BECAUSE IT HAS HAPPENED. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT. I THINK SOME THINGS ARE MISSED. AND I FEEL LIKE. WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. DISCUSSION THAT I HAVE ENGAGED IN MY ENTIRE ELECTED EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING THAT'S GOING ON HERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF MISPLACED PERSPECTIVE. AND WHAT I WANT TO TRY. TO HELP. THOSE WHO DISTRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TO TRY TO JUST UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE. THAT SIDE OF THE DISCUSSION. YOU KNOW ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO SWEAR THAT WE'RE WE'RE REQUIRED WHEN I SAY WE ARE NO LONGER A MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT I WAS FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. SO I I DO BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND THAT PERSPECTIVE. AND I JUST WANT TO CLEARLY TRY TO BRING SOME BALANCE TO THIS DISCUSSION. BECAUSE I KNOW THE EMOTION OF DISTRESS IS HUGELY POWERFUL. AND I'M NOT TRYING TO DISCOUNT THAT. I TRIED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. THIS ONE PART OF THIS BILL. I CAN NEVER SUPPORT. IT'S NOT NEGOTIABLE AND THAT IS THE TERM REASONABLE. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO SWEAR WILLINGNESS TO DIE. IN PRESERVING PEACE. ARE THREATENED BY THIS VERY VERY TERM. IMAGINE HOW THE PROPOSAL OF GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT WOULD BE RECEIVED. THAT'S HOW DRAMATIC THIS POLICY SHIFT HAVE. AND I'M TELLING YOU WHY I MEAN EVEN. I'M NOT. SUGGESTING THAT TAKE PLACE AT ALL. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT'S THE DRAMATIC IMPACT. CHANGING THE WORD REASONABLE. IN THE ABILITY TO PROTECT ONESELF WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEIR LIFE IS THREATENED. THAT'S A SUPREME COURT TESTED STANDARD EVERYONE. AND I THINK A LOT OF THE AND JUSTICE THAT HAS HAPPENED. HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE RULING. OF A JURY. AND A TRIAL. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A PERFECT STANDARD. BUT I COULD TELL YOU. WITH OUT ANY HESITATION. AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SHARE A VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE MYSELF. AND I SEE THERE'S GROANS IN RESPONSE TO THAT BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S AND DESERVES TO BE MENTIONED. I HAVE A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. WHO SERVED ALSO IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETIRED? DURING THE COURSE OF HIS. SERVICE. HE WAS INVOLVED IN A DEADLY SHOOTING. TO WHERE HE HAD TO TAKE THE LIFE OF A PERSON WHO WAS ATTACKING HIM. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT INCIDENT CHANGED HIS LIFE. AND NOT FOR THE GOOD. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS JUSTIFIABLE. THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO TAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE [inaudible] CAUSED HIM [inaudible] TO ADAPT. TO THAT CHALLENGE IN A WAY THAT WAS HURTFUL. AND IT LED TO AN ADDICTION. THE LEAD TO A A FAMILY INTERVENTION. AND THE FAMILY INTERVENTION TRIED TO REACH OUT AND SUPPORT THIS FRIEND OF MINE. LIFE. AND THAT SOMEONE IS FORGOTTEN IN THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT. WHEN PEACE OFFICERS ARE PLACED IN A POSITION? TO WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE. THEY HAVE TO USE DEADLY FORCE. NO ONE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT POSITION. AND I WOULD JUST ASK THE IF WE NEED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS LET'S MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS BUT LET'S ANYTHING THAT. CHANGES THE WORD REASONABLE. IN THE ABILITY. TO DEFEND ONESELF IS UNREASONABLE. AND I WOULD ASK THE JUST NOT BE THE MEASURE THAT WE USED TO BUILD BACK TRUST BECAUSE IT WILL DO. MORE DAMAGE AND VERY VERY. SAD CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE OFFICERS WILL HESITATE. THAT HESITATION. WILL CAUSE A LOT WILL RESULT IN LOSS OF LIFE AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER [inaudible] DIAZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SERMON AYE AYE -- I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN -- MENTION -- TODAY. THIS ISSUE IS -- EXTREMELY TOUGH A VERY A VERY PASSIONATE EMOTIONS ON BOTH SIDE I WANT TO SAY THAT -- I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR DR WEBBER -- FOR BRINGING THIS ITEM FOR BECAUSE SHE DOES HAVE THE COURAGE. TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS RIGHT -- I MY BIGGEST CONCERN. WITH THIS BILL [inaudible] IS. THE ABILITY TO SECOND GUESS OUR FRONTLINE OFFICERS [inaudible] AND CAUSE THEM TO HESITATE. OR SLOW DOWN EVEN FOR A SECOND OR TWO WHILE THEY ARE IN THE FIELD. SOMETIME TAKING FIRES AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS. AN ACCEPTABLE MEDIUM. ANYWHERE BETWEEN. WHAT IT IS THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE VERSES WHAT -- OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY -- IS. ADVOCATING AGAINST. I HOPE THERE IS -- AND AND IF THERE IS THAT I WON REFER BACK. TO WHAT MY OF MY COLLEAGUES -- MISTER QUIRK AND MISTER AND MRS -- BAR CAN WAS VOTE. MENTIONING EARLIER. IS THAT IT GIVE. A WE TRULY HAVE. SOME RESERVATION ABOUT THIS BILL TODAY. THIS IS THE COMMITTEE THIS THE POLICY COMMITTEE WHERE. WE SHOULD WORK THIS OUT. BECAUSE IF WE LET THIS BILL. GET OFF THE FLOOR HOW DO YOU NEGOTIATE WITH [inaudible] EIGHTY MEMBERS -- THE EIGHT OF US. HALF THE POWER WITHIN THIS BODY. TO SEE IF WE CAN COME. TO AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION TO BOTH SIDES IF THERE IS -- ONE TO TO BE HAPPY. BUT IF WE COME HERE AND AND WE SAY THAT. WE WE UNDERSTAND ISSUES. WE WILL MOVE THIS BILL FOR FOR FURTHER. NEGOTIATIONS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS. THE RIGHT APPROACH. AND AND AND FOR THAT TODAY IS GERMAN -- I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. AND I STRONGLY URGE -- MY COLLEAGUES DOES THAT STILL HAVE SOME RESERVATION ABOUT THIS BILL. TO KEEP IT HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO THE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY WORK ON IT. WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR? THE THE FLOODGATES IT'S IT'S IT'S OPEN [inaudible] AND THANK YOU MISTER. YET TO COME -- I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING LOOK THAT THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE SO I WE DIFFERENT OPINIONS BECAUSE NONE OF OUR BILLS ARE PERFECT IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE. I MEAN WE'VE OFTEN SAT BEFORE CHAIRS WITH OFTEN SAT BEFORE -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN AND DISCUSS THE FACT THAT OUR BILLS WILL CHANGE AND IN FACT. YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING. PROPOSAL THAT I'M MOVING FORWARD. TOTALLY DIFFERENT COMMITTEE RIGHT NO MY STE WHY NO MY BILLS NOT COOKED BUT IT'S GOT NINE MONTHS TO GO IN IF I CAN'T GET IT DONE AND AND NINE MONTHS THEN WILL SPILL OVER TO A TWO YEAR SESSION. THAT'S THE NORM -- AND SO I I WE WERE DIFFERENT IN IN THAT SORT OF OPINION IN. BUT I WANT TO SAY FIRST TO TO BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AND THE AUTHOR. THAT I I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A SHORT TIME ABOUT FIVE YEARS. AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF HEATED DEBATES THIS IS ONE OF THE HEATED DEBATES I SEEM WERE BOTH SIDES OF CONDUCTED THEMSELVES. IN THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WAY. AND THE CONVERSATIONS ON BOTH SIDES OF BEEN LOUD BUT IN A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. POLICY ORIENTED WAY I NEVER HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT THERE NEED THAT THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I'VE HEARD I'VE HEARD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE -- AM PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE AUTHOR ONCE AND I AGREE THERE NEEDS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO DO POLICING DRIVER LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU -- ON HOW. TO DIFFERENT SIDES CAN SEE THE SAME LANGUAGE. AND TWO DIFFERENT SIDES SEE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT OUTCOME. AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING. BUT I DON'T THINK. BECAUSE THAT SITUATION EXISTED THE BILL NEEDS TO BE HELD. IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE IN AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT IT SENDS OUT. IS THAT THIS IS NOT A SEARS ENOUGH ISSUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND I DO HAVE TRUST IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE. TO ASK MEMBERS TO HELP ME TO GET MY COMMITTEE OUT. OF MY BILLS OUT OF COMMITTEE AND I UP I HAVE SOME FAITH IN THE SYSTEM -- THAT'LL BE A IS THAT THEY'LL BE A CONVERSATION. NO NO ONE HERE WANTS TO SEE AN OFFICER PART. I'M PRETTY CERTAIN ABOUT THAT -- BUT NO ONE HERE ALSO WANTS TO SE. ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO WHO IS INNOCENT. OR GUILTY HURT EITHER. I MEAN LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND I TRUST AND AND I TRUST IN THIS WEBER MY INTEREST IN THIS WEBER THAT SHE'S TAKEN A LOOK AT THIS -- AND THEY TAKE A LOOK AT THE END OF THE LANGUAGE AND ENSURING THAT THAT WE THAT WE DO. THAT THAT IT REFLECTS. WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO NOT TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE THAT AND THEIR ABILITY TO COME IN? AND TALK IN AND AND PROPOSE LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS LIVE LEGITIMATE ISSUES. NOT WANTING TO CHANGE IS ONE THING. AND WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE RIGHT WE HAVE TO NUDGE FOLKS TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT. WELL -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO UP HERE THAT'S WHAT LEGISLATION DOES -- BUT WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANNA THANK YOU LOOK I HAVE A DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVE ON ON HOW I VIEW LAW ENFORCEMENT BASED ON THINGS THAT HAPPENED -- IN MY LIFE AND MOST RECENTLY -- WHAT WE'VE HEARD SITUATIONS OF PEOPLE BEING SCARED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT I I'VE ALSO BEEN A SITUATION WERE RECENTLY I'VE SHARED WITH MOST PEOPLE HERE PRIVATELY IT'S A FIRST TIME ALL SHARE PUBLICLY -- I'D LIKE TO ATTEND THE BREAK INS IN MY HOUSE. OF THE FIRST WHEN I WAS THERE -- AND FORTUNATELY THE PERSON DIDN'T. MANAGE TO GET IN AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAME IN THEY WERE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE RESPONSE TIME WAS A QUICK ENOUGH AND THE PERSON WAS NOT A SERIOUS THREAT BUT THEY THEY GOT TO THE DOOR AND THEY WERE STARTING TO DO WHAT THEY GOTTA DO AND I'M UPSTAIRS. WITH MY KIDS BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT GOES ON YOUR MIND. I NOT BEEN THERE. HAD HAD BEEN TWO HOURS LATER MORE SLEEP [inaudible] EVERYTHING. THAT YOU WOULD FOR YOUR LIFE. FLASH BEFORE MY EYES IN THAT MOMENT. THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO BREAK IN -- WAS A GOOD VIEW WEEKS AGO. AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE KNOW WITH THOSE ONE PERSON OR TWO PEOPLE AND AND AND IT WAS TERRIFYING. AND AND OBVIOUSLY I FLY UP HERE FOR WORK THAT'S NOT A SECRET. FOR ANYBODY THINK THAT'S A SECRET WHILE -- BUT I OFTEN THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THAT HAPPENED AND YEAH I WAS ON THE PHONE [inaudible] AND RAISING MY VOICE ASKING THEM TO GET THERE SOONER AND QUICKER. IN FIVE MINUTES. IT'S NOT LIKE AN ETERNITY. AS I'M WAITING SIDE OF MY HOUSE AND MY WIFE IS UPSTAIRS LOCK IN THE LOW OR PUTTING AS MUCH THINGS SHE CANNOT FOR THE DOOR. NOW IT WASN'T AS BAD. AS AS I AM MAKING IT THE SOUND ONCE WE HAD ALL THE FACTS. BUT WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FAX. ANYONE HERE WOULD BE TERRIFIED. DID NOT KNOW WHAT THOSE ONE PERSON OR TWO PEOPLE OUTSIDE -- AND FORTUNATELY FORTUNATELY NOTHING HAPPENED I RAN OUTSIDE WITH THE BATON THE REST OF IT I WILL. I WILL CHAIR BECAUSE I I WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT RULE WALKED OUTSIDE WITH ABOUT NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING ON IT TO BE CONFRONTED -- ALSO BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT THAT WAS THEIR JOB. AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT TWO TWO DIFFERENT -- COMMANDS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I WAS AT BUT I WAS A LITTLE BIT WORRIED AND IDEA WASN'T THINKING RATIONALLY THE TIME -- SO MY PERSPECTIVE ON APPROACHING THIS -- IS UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION -- FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT'S HARD WORK. AND THE SITUATIONS THEY OFTEN PUT THEMSELVES IN -- TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. AND AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT EVEN HAVING SAID THAT I I I STILL THINK. IT'S NECESSARY TO BOOK THIS BILL OUT. EVIL DOES BILL OUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY I AM INTERPRETING THIS. BUT IT MEANS THAT THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THE MOVE. FOR AND ALL OF US HAVE BEEN THERE THE WAR WILL HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND WE'LL HAVE TO HAMMER OUT ANY ANY ANY [inaudible] POLICY DISCUSSIONS. THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN IN LANGUAGE AND THIS IS WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS DOES -- TO ALL ONE THANK THE AUTHOR AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR COMING. HAVE IN THIS -- IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. AND I'M FAITHFUL IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT IS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY -- GOOD LEGISLATION IS BUILT. AND IT ACHIEVES THE GOALS -- THERE ARE SET FORTH -- HERE TODAY. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK ON THIS. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE CHARACTERIZE THIS. IN A WAY THAT THAT. IN A WAY THAT THAT THAT MAKES SENSE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SANTIAGO AND UP. AND YOU KNOW I I PROBABLY WANT TO ALSO. MAYBE TRY -- TO RESET. THE PRIORITIES OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IN THE BIG PICTURE. AND I KIND OF CAME TO ME AS I SAT LISTENED. TO BOTH SIDES THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT. COMMITTEE HEARINGS YOU GET TO HEAR BOTH SIDES AND IF YOU REALLY LISTEN. YOU CAN REALLY HEAR SOMETHING AS MANY OF YOU KNOW -- I DO A LOT OF WORK WITH TRONG WHERE'S TRUMP ON CARE. ASUS WHETHER IT'S WHAT I CALL POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER THE COMMON THAT PEOPLE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE. AND AS I LISTEN TO THIS. THE SHERIFF'S -- JULIE ROBINSON THIS THIS HERO ABOUT DEFENDING HERSELF AND HER PUBLISHER PARTNER. I REALIZED HOW MUCH TRAUMA SHE'S EXPERIENCE. AND THEN WHEN IT. I LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUE TO MY LEFT. AND HE TALKED ABOUT. SOMEONE DID HE WORK WITH OR IF YOU KNEW VERY WELL. THAT -- WAS INVOLVED IN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING. THAT TRAUMATIZED HIM. TO THE POINT WHERE HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE. AND THEN I HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUE TO MY RIGHT. THE END WHO -- KIND OF BROKE DOWN. AND ABOUT JUST HAVING LAW ENFORCEMENT IN HER HOME. AND WORRIED ABOUT HER FAMILY. ESPECIALLY IS NOW AFTER AMERICAN MALE ALL RIGHT I CAN EMPATHIZE WITH HER. AND I KNOW WHAT THAT FEELINGS LIKE. AND SO ON BOTH SIDES ESPECIALLY YOUNG MEN TO TESTIFY TODAY -- WE'RE ALL TRYING TO TOUCH AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IS RISEN TO THIS LEVEL. BUT I HOPE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS AND WE HAVE TO GET THIS RESOLVED. BECAUSE WE ARE ALL TRAUMATIZED. WHEN AN OFFICER? IS KILLED BY A CRIMINAL. THEY ARE TRAUMATIZED THE WHOLE. SECTOR THEY'RE TRAUMATIZED. AND IT HAS AN EFFECT ON HIM THAT I THINK SOMETIMES. LAW ENFORCEMENT. JUST LIKE AN AFTER MERRICK IN LIKE IN COMMITTEE WOULD ALWAYS SEEK MENTAL HEALTH. IN FACT IT IS PROBABLY. FROWNED UPON. ON BOTH OUR COMMUNITIES. I WILL NEED. NO PART OF THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENS? AFTER THAT HAPPENS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. TO BOTH SIDES WHEN I AM HAVING THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO HEAL THAT COULD THAT IS PROBABLY WHAT KEEPS THAT'S ST GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO RESET. THE CONVERSATION AS I BELIEVE IT I HOPE AS WE MOVED OUT. OF THIS COMMITTEE TO WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. ON TO RESOLVE THIS -- I'M LOOKING AT PAGE. THREE SEE WHERE SAYS NEITHER THIS SECTION OR SECTION ONE NINETY SEVEN PROVIDE A PEACE OFFICER WITH THE DEFENSE TO MANSLAUGHTER IN VIOLATION OF SECTION. ONE NINETY TWO IF THAT PERSON WAS KILLED DUE TO THE CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT CONDUCT OF THE OFFICER INCLUDING SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE VICTIM IS A PERSON. OTHER THAN THE PERSON THAT THE OFFICER WAS SEEKING TO ARREST RETAIN CUSTODY OR DEFENDING GUESTS OR IT DIDN'T ASSESS CITY. FOR THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE WAS CREATED BY THE PEACE OFFICERS CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE. I DON'T THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT MEANS. IT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. DOES A CRIMINAL ACT. BECAUSE THEY HAD TO MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION. THAT WE CAN'T JUDGE A CRIMINAL ACT. BUT I'M HEARING. CONVERSATIONS BOTH WAYS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER IF YOU NEED TO BE SOME CLARIFYING LANGUAGE. TO ENSURE THAT THAT 1% OF THE NINE OF THE CLOUDED [inaudible] WITH. WHAT THE 1% DOES DâN LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO DO THAT TO MOVE THE SPORT -- SO THAT WE HAVE THINGS IN PLACE [inaudible] SO THAT [inaudible] WE DO. CREATE. BETTER OFFICERS I DON'T BELIEVE WE NEED TO GO TO THE LOWEST DENOMINATOR. I BELIEVE WE CAN SET STANDARDS POLICIES PROCEDURES AND TRAINING. SO THAT WE GET THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST. AND THE ONES THAT CAN BE LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT EVER I DON'T BELIEVE EVERYBODY CAN BE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TRAINING THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A WHOLE SYSTEM. TO WEED THEM OUT. AND IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HAVING A HIGHER STANDARD A HIGHER STANDARD. OF POSSIBLE TRAINING IN A FOR FUTURE BECAUSE WE'VE NOW. 239-2 HAVE NOW SET A HIGHER STANDARD THEN LET'S [inaudible] DO THAT. LOOK I WANT TO BE A POLICE OFFICER. BUT I DON'T HAVE TWENTY TWENTY VISION. AND ALSO I'M OLD THEY DON'T HAVE A EIGHT HAVE ALL THAT I STUFF YOU ZHAI'S CORRECTED. TO GET TO TWENTY TWENTY SO I DIDN'T MAKE IT. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU AT I WAS IN AND REASONABLE STANDARD. BUT NOW THAT I'M OLDER. YEAH I DO WANT TO HAVE AN OFFICER WITH TWENTY TWENTY VISION. TO BE ABLE TO SEE. WHAT'S GOING ON TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS WITH ALL OF THEIR FACILITIES AT 1100% CAPABILITIES. AND SO -- MY IT'S NOT A QUESTION BUT IT IS A A FIRM REQUEST IF NOT AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE -- ALMOST A DEMAND FROM BOTH SIDES THAT YOU. GET PAST THE TRAUMA. IF YOU NEED ME TO GET YOU SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU HAVE SOME TALKING SESSIONS OR A DIVORCE ATTORNEY OR SOMEBODY TO GET YOU TOGETHER. GET RID OF ALL THE THE PAIN. AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN STOP. FUTURE PAIN. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I SEE NOT ONLY HERE BUT I'VE ALSO SEE LAW ENFORCEMENT ALSO SEE IN THIS AUDIENCE. THERE'S A LOT OF PAIN. THAT. AS LEGISLATORS. YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS SAY WE CAN'T LEGISLATE PAIN AWAY YOU CAN'T LEGISLATE RACISM CAN'T. BUT WE CAN WE CAN PUT IN PLACE -- LAWS THAT HELP US MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. AND I HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES THAT. YOU WANT TO GET THERE. IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW. AND I'M HOPING THAT. AS IT MOVES OUT HERE WE CAN GET THERE. AND SO. WITH THAT IF YOU'RE AREN'T ANY MORE QUESTIONS. I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES FOR YOUR FOR YEARS YOUR TESTIMONY. I WANT. TO THANK THE AUDIENCE FOR LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY. AND I WANNA THANK YOU AND WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN HAVING PEOPLE COME IN STATE THEIR NAME -- WHETHER FOR WHATEVER NOW IT WILL WHERE THEY STAND ON THE ISSUE. AND WHAT ORGANIZATION I BELONG. TO AND TO MIKE'S ON EACH SIDE THERE WILL BE THE DEAL THE WITNESSES ARE DISMISSED AND WE WILL BEGIN OUR PROCESS. OF ME TO USE. NAME ORGANIZATION. I'M SORRY I TAKE THAT BACK WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE WELL WHO ARE IN SUPPORT FIRST AND THEN WE'LL DO OPPOSITION. SO AND SUPPORT FIRST AND THEN OPPOSITION TO SAME. WAY WE DID THE THE OTHER SIDE.

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. YOU MAKE CLOSE. YES MY AS MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL AS I BEGAN ONE OF THE THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL. AND AND THE FACT THAT ALL OF YOU GAVE ME TIME TO MEET WITH YOU AND TO DISCUSS THE ELEMENTS OF THE BILL I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO -- I THANK THOSE WHO CAME TODAY I MEAN AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FROM THE AUDIENCE THAT -- PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. MANY OF THE WORKING CLASS INDIVIDUALS TAKING OFF FROM WORK TO COME TO HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND. THEIR PAIN AND THEIR CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF THEM FOR COMING. IT WAS NOT EASY FOR ME TO ACCEPT THIS BILL AS A BILL FOR ME TO SPONSOR YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT -- IS THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO INTO THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER NOT YOU GOING TO DO A BILL. THAT'S BROUGHT TO YOU BY A COULD A COALITION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BRING CHANGE. I'VE HAD MANY THOUGHTS ABOUT NOT DOING THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFICULT BILL AND IT IS TAKING ITS TOLL CLEARLY ON MY STAFF. ON ON ME AND ON MY FAMILY. OF WHEN YOU'RE VILIFIED AND YOU TALKED ABOUT IN THE IN THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON. AND SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRY TO BRING CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW THAT AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO SPONSOR THESE BILLS AND TRY TO EXPLAIN TO OTHERS HOW YOU FEEL. I'M OFTEN REMINDED OF THE MOVIE A TIME TO KILL. WHEN AT THE VERY END THE LAWYER GAVE ITS SCENARIO OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG GIRL AND HE SAID CLOSE YOUR EYES AND IMAGINE SHE WAS WHITE? AND THAT'S KIND OF THE WAY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP FOLKS UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY. FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS NOW AND STILL FIND YOURSELF. ONCE AGAIN UNFAIRLY TREATED OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF BIAS. BUT CLEARLY OF DISCOVERING THAT THE NUMBERS THAT TALK ABOUT THE DEATH OF UNARMED AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO MALES IS TRULY OUT OF PROPORTION. TO THEIR POSITION IN THE SOCIETY IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS. AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PASSPORT FOR CHANGE. THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY WE HOPE PUT ANY OFFICER AT HARM THAT IS NOT THE INTENT. IS TO ONCE AGAIN ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUES WE FACE IN THIS NATION FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. OF HOW WE TREAT OTHERS WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE US. AND HOW THEY FEEL SOMETIMES BEING UNFAIRLY TREATED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT MY COMMUNITY DOES NOT FEEL ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED BY LAW FOR BLOOD WORK IN THE IN THE READING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT WHEN THEY CALL THE POLICE OFFICERS THEY ARE AFRAID MUCH MORE FOOD NOT ONLY WHAT IS OUTSIDE THAT THEY'RE FIGHTING BUT WHAT THEY'VE MADE EXPERIENCE ONCE A PERSON'S ARRIVE. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT MY COMMUNITY OFTEN ON REPRESENTED ADEQUATELY IF YOU CAN BE FROM THE SUPPORT OF POLICE DEPARTMENT. IN OTHER WORDS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO CALL THEIR POLICE AND KNOW THAT WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY GOING TO GET GOOD SERVICE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. AND THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. THIS BILL I HOPE STRIKES A BALANCE CLEARLY THERE WERE THOSE WHO WANTED THINGS FAR MORE EXTREME. IT IS NOT DESIGNED IN ANY WAY TO VICTIMIZE ANYONE. BUT IT IS DESIGNED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF POLICING IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE WE ARRIVE AT A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE TO PUT IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS ARE TREATED WITH RESPECT. AND THAT WE RESPECT LIFE. THAT WE RESPECT LIFE AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. I HAVE NEVER MET PEOPLE MORE PAINFULLY HURT THAN THOSE WHO IN THIS AUDIENCE. IT IS MADE ME KEENLY AWARE OF JUST HOW DEEP AND HOW HARD THE PAIN IS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE THIS BEEN FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE. NOT JUST THE LOSS OF AN INDIVIDUAL BUT THE METHOD IN WHICH IT THEY'VE BEEN LOST. AND I THINK YOU CAN STILL FEEL THE PAIN THAT'S THEIR FROM FIVE AND SIX AND TEN AND TWELVE YEARS OF MOTHERS AND NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND COUSINS WHO LOST INDIVIDUALS. WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY GOT THE FOR YOUR SHEER OF WHAT TOOK PLACE? THIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO ONCE AGAIN TO HEAD PAMPER OUR POLICE OFFICERS FROM DOING THEIR JOBS. WE NEED THEM TO DO THEIR JOB. BUT IT IS TO SET A STANDARD IN A BAR FOR PRACTICE AND TRAINING THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ARRIVALS AT A CONCLUSION BUT WE WILL HAVE FEW INDIVIDUALS HARMED AND NOT MORE. IT IS NOT OUR INTENT TO SPEND OUR TIME TALKING ABOUT PROSECUTING OFFICERS BUT HOW DO WE PREVENT THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE SEE EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA. I SPEAK TO YOU AS A MEMBER OF THIS ASSEMBLY IN MOST OF YOU KNOW ME I DON'T DO THINGS OUT OF MALICIOUSNESS I ON'T DO IT OUT OF VINDICTIVENESS I NEVER HAVE. NOT ONLY AT THIS ASSEMBLY BUT THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE AS AN EDUCATOR FOR FORTY SOMEBODY IS A SAN DIEGO STATE. BUT I'VE STUDIED THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. AND I KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT AN OPENING IN PRESENTING THIS BILL BASICALLY OPEN SOME LOANS THAT MOST OF US DON'T WANT TO HAVE OPEN ANYMORE. AND YET WE SEE THE PRODUCT OF IT EVERY DAY WHEN WE SEE THE UNFORTUNATE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN OUR STATE. SO WE CAN NO LONGER SHOULD SIGN UP LONGER HIDE BEHIND THE LESSONS ALONG WHAT NO LONGER HIDE BEHIND THE SCHEELS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US. WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE ISSUE THAT IS THE YEAR AND THE ISSUE WAS FAIRLY CLEAR IN CALIFORNIA. AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO MALES ARE BEING SHOT MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. WHAT ON ARMED? AND THEY'RE A LOT OF INCIDENTS THAT GO INTO IT. AND WE DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY MAKE OFFICES IN CAPABLE OF OF DEALING WITH THE COMMUNITIES BUT WE WANT TO ARM THEM WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF TRAINING. WE WANT TO ARM THEM WITH THE KIND OF STANDARDS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY THAT MAKES OUR BUT OFFICERS STRONGER AND BETTER AND MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAFER. THIS BILL IS APPLIED IN OTHER STATES HAS NOT DONE WITH SO MANY PEOPLE THINK IT WILL DO WHICH IS TO LIVE POLICE OFFICERS UP AND PROSECUTE ALL OF THEM. WHAT IT IS DONE IN SEATTLE AND WHAT IT IS DOING IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS MADE THOSE COMMUNITIES SAFER? HAVE MADE A OFFICER SAFER AND HAVE MADE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER WE ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US. AS WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OFFICERS WHO WANT TO WORK ON BEHALF OF CHANGE BUT IT IS CLEAR THE CHANGE HAS TO COME TO CALIFORNIA. AND AB THREE NINE TWO IS THE FIRST STEP IN THAT CHANGE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] AND THEN.

ON THE OTHER BOTH. THE SECOND. IS THE CHAIR FOR HIS START WITH A. B. SIXTEEN HUNDRED SIXTEEN HUNDRED YEAH. OKAY THAT IS OUT OF THE MOTIONS ON SIXTEEN HUNDRED YES YES. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE OPTION WAS ON THIS BILL FOR YOU TODAY THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THREE CHANGES. TO EXISTING PITCHES MOTION PROCEDURES TO ENSURE GREATER ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS AND THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL FOR PERSONS CHARGED WITH CRIMES. PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE PUBLIC STATUS AS PEOPLE TO TWENTY ONE AND ENSURE THAT EVIDENCE IS BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY MISCONDUCT IS BROUGHT TO LIGHT WHEN IT IS RELEVANT TO A DEFENDANT'S CASE. TYPICALLY IN AN EFFORT TO BRING PITCHES MOTION TIMELINES TO A LINE OF THE REGULAR COULD NOT DISCOVER THE NOTICE TIMELINES. MAYBE SIXTEEN HUNDRED A MAN EVIDENCE CODE THE EVIDENCE FOR DELYLAH TIME PREDICTIONS COVERING MOTIONS TO PUT. WITH THE NOTICE PERIOD FOR DISCOVERY MOTIONS -- CASES. AS A FORMER DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER OF EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND THE CHALLENGE. OF OF PURSUING -- TIME NOT WAIVE JURY TRIALS USUALLY BECAUSE OF MY CLIENT COULD NOT BE ALLOWED. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS CRITICAL TO QUICKLY FILE AND FOLLOW UP ON THE RESULTS WITH PICTURES MOTION. GIVEN THE EXPO THE EXPERIMENT A TIME TO REST. THE FORMER LEASE PURCHASE INFORMATION AT THE TIME CONSTRAINTS ABOUT DEFENSE COUNSEL AND THE PROSECUTOR. OF OFF OFTEN RENDERED THE WITNESSES THE WITNESSES REVEALED AS A RESULT OF THE PICTURES -- BUT UNDER THE MALLS ARE DONE USABLE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO FOLLOW UP ON THE LIST. OF POTENTIAL WITNESSES. DEEMED THE INFORMATION NOT READY -- BEFORE THE JURY TRIAL PROCESS. THIS PLACE BOTH DEFENDANTS -- AND PROSECUTORS AS WELL AS OUR USUAL PROCESS IN GENERAL ON FOR A POSITION WITH THE RIGHT TO SPEAK TRIAL. IS BOUNCE AGAINST THAT HAVE BEEN IS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. THE BILL ALSO MAKES AN ALIGNMENT CORRECTION TO THE CHANGES MADE IN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE FROM LAST YEAR BY ENSURING THAT COURTS MAY NOT ISSUE A PROTECTIVE ORDER. THE MANY THE USE OF RECORDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT THIS LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE PROTECT ORDER IF THE PUBLIC RECORDS RETAIN PROPERLY AND WITH IN ACCORDANCE TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. LASTLY TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY BUT ALSO REPEAL RESTRICTIONS EXEMPTING SUPERVISING OFFICERS FROM THE DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS OF THE PRIOR MISCONDUCT WHEN IT WHEN IT IS PERTINENT TO A DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. THIS PROVISIONS ESSENTIAL TO SHOWING A PATTERN OR PRACTICE ON THE PART OF SUPERVISORS WHO COVER UP OR FEEL TO REPORT MISCONDUCT OTHER SUPPORT. BUT ALSO OF FOR THE SAME PROTECTIONS ALONG FOR SOME BY SUBJECTING THE PITCHES MOTION FOR SUPERVISING OFFICER RECORDS. THE SAME JUDICIAL SCRUTINY ALREADY REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW. IT WILL BE LIMITED TO WHAT IS RELEVANT TO THE CASE AS DETERMINED BY THE JUDGE. BY MAKING THESE MODEST CHANGES CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE PITCHES PROCEDURES LESS BURDENSOME AND TIME CONSUMING BY INCREASING FAIRNESS. IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE AND MAKE NOTE OF THE TICKET NUMBER WITNESSES TEST AS WELL. BY MORNING TOTAL YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SUSAN LEFT FIND THE ASSISTANT PUBLIC DEFENDER OF NEVADA COUNTY UP NORTH WHERE I SUPERVISE THE MISDEMEANOR DIVISION -- I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. AND I'M HERE WITH KATHLEEN FROM THE ACLU WE'VE DIVIDED UP THE WORK AND I'M A SHORT MY COMMENTS TO ABOUT HALF OF WHAT THEY WERE BUT I'LL BE AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THE POINT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH A BEAST THAT AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED SEEKS TO FIX AND THAT IS THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR FILING PITCHES MOTIONS IT SIMPLY TAKES TOO LONG. IT DOESN'T EXCESSIVELY LONG NOTICE REQUIREMENT OF SIXTEEN DAYS WHEN NEARLY ALL THE OTHER MOTIONS THAT AYE FILING CRIMINAL COURT REQUIRE JUST TEN DAYS NOTICE. A DIFFERENCE OF SIXTIES MIGHT NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH TO YOU BUT TO SOMEBODY WHO'S SITTING IN JAIL ON A MISDEMEANOR CASE. THAT'S A CRITICAL AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT'S BECAUSE A PERSON WHO'S CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR ALSO HAS A STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. SO BY REDUCING THE NOTICE PERIOD FOR HEARINGS ON PITCHES MOTIONS FROM SIXTEEN DAYS DOWN TO TEN DAYS. IT WILL MAKE IT MORE IN LINE WITH ALL THE OTHER CRIMINAL MOTIONS IT WAS STREAMLINED THE PROCESS AND ALLOW MORE MISDEMEANOR DEFENDANT TO ACTUALLY FILE THESE MOTIONS WITHOUT WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL. THIS CHANGE IN THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT WILL PROVIDE THOSE IN CUSTODY MISTER MINUTES WITH A MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PITCHES PROCEDURE. AND THAT WILL RESULT IN MORE TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS AND WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO AFTER ALL -- WE ALL WANT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE PROPER TOOLS ARE ALREADY THERE BUT IF THEY COME TO USE THEIR NOT ACCESSIBLE THEY'RE NOT HELPING PEOPLE. SO I'LL LEAVE MY COMMENTS THERE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'LL BE AVAILABLE AND AGAIN I ROOM I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M KATHLEEN GOOD AROUND THE FROM THE ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN OUR LITIGATION DEFENDING SB. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PRIOR TO THAT I WAS A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR ABOUT A DECADE WHERE I ARGUED WROTE MANY PITCHES MOTIONS. I TOO WOULD URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE TWO OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT AB. SIXTEEN HUNDRED SEEKS TO FIX IS BY REPEALING EVIDENCE CODE. TEN FORTY SEVEN THIS -- THE BILL WOULD. ENABLE CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS TO OBTAIN CRITICAL PRIOR MISCONDUCT INFORMATION FOR SUPERVISORS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NOT MET THE DEFENDANT DIRECTLY WERE INVOLVED IN WRONGDOING. AT SUCH A SIGNING OFF ON THE SUBORDINATES FALSE ARREST. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A FAIR TRIAL IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- MANY OF US COULD HAVE USED IN MISDEMEANOR JURY TRIALS THAT WE HAVE ARGUED TO SHOW A PATTERN OF WRONGDOING. SUPERVISORS WHO SIGN OFF ON OTHERS OFFICERS FALSE REPORTS SHOULD NOT BE EXEMPT FROM HAVING THEIR MISCONDUCT DISCLOSED. AND THE FINAL THING AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOES IS IT CLARIFIES THAT WHEN THE INFORMATION ABOUT POLICE MISCONDUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. THE COURT CANNOT LIMIT ITS DISCLOSURE THROUGH A PROTECTIVE ORDER. THIS MAY SEEM LIKE A COMMONSENSE SIMPLE CLARIFICATION. BUT IT LET ME ASSURE YOU IS SIMPLE CLARIFICATIONS ARE WELCOMING NECESSARY IN CROWDED CRIMINAL COURT ROOMS AND THIS INFORMATION IN THIS BILL WILL BE HELPFUL TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING D. A.'S PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND JUDGES. I REMAIN AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I TO LITERATURE I VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN. SUPPORT.

WHICH RELY HEAVILY ON QUESTIONABLE AN ABUSE OF TACT TACTICS THE CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AND IN CONTRADICTION OF FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SUCH NOT ONLY LEVERAGING COMPELS STATE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENFORCE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW. IT IS ALSO WORK TO UTILIZE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES IN THE SEPARATE. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS BEGUN TO RELY HEAVILY ON THE USE OF PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS TO ENFORCE. FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW WHICH INCLUDES THE UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS TO TAKE INTO CUSTODY DETAIN ARREST IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE SECURED THE RIGHT TO RELEASE FROM CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS. THIS IS IN DIRECT CONTRAVENTION OF ESTABLISHED FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AS WELL AS WELL ESTABLISHED LEGAL PRECEDENT.
