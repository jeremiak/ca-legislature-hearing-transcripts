AFTERNOON EVERYONE. I AM ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MULLIN SPEAKER PRO TEM OF THE ASSEMBLY AND PROUD TO REPRESENT THE TWENTY SECOND. ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU. TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATIONAL HEARING. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR JOINING US TODAY I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE DR BILL QUIRK FROM THE EAST BAY. HOW FOR JOINING US OUT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS LIFE I BELIEVE WILL BE TRICKLING IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED SINCE THIS IS THE BUSY SEASON? HA IN THE LEGISLATURE SO WE HOPE TO HAVE A FEW MORE MEMBERS -- BUT WE ARE WILL HAVE THIS IS WELL ON ASSEMBLY TV I WANT TO THANK -- INJURIES AND GOLLY MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AS WELL AS LAURA FITZGERALD OF MY STAFF FOR HELPING ME -- COORDINATE AND ORGANIZE THE HEARING TODAY I AM HONORED TO CHAIR THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY OUR OVER ARCHING GOAL WITH THIS COMMITTEE IS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS UP TO DATE. AND WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. THE SELECT COMMITTEE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY FOCUSES ON THREE KEY ASPECTS OF THE BIOTECH ECOSYSTEM IN OUR STATE. OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. IMPORTANT LEGAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES IMPACTING THE INDUSTRY. AND HOW THIS INDUSTRY IS SUPPORTING AND SUPPORTED BY OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. TODAY'S HEARING IS VERY APPROPRIATE THAT IN PROVIDING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. ALSO KNOWN AS SERVE. AS WELL AS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE WORKED WITH OR OBSERVED SARM -- IN THE TIME SINCE ITS INCEPTION FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PRESENTERS THAT WE PLAN HERE FROM TODAY AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE AGENDA. COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE PRESENTERS AFTR EACH AGENDA ITEM WE WILL ALSO I GIVE A CHANCE FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ARE AT THE AT TOWARD THE END OF OUR HEARING IN OUR GOAL IS TO WRAP UP BY THREE PM -- IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. SO A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND CALIFORNIA STEM CELL AGENCY WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WHEN 59% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION. SEVENTY ONE THE CALIFORNIA STEM CELL RESEARCH AND CURES INITIATIVE. THAT INITIATIVE AUTHORIZED THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH CREATED THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. THE MEASURE IN DOUBTS ARE WITH THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN BHADRAK ANY TO FIND CALIFORNIA STEM CELL LABORATORIES IN A TRACK WORLD CLASS RESEARCHERS. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE HELL TWO INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP SEVENTY ONE IN MARCH AND OCTOBER. OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THE FIRST FOCUSED ON OVERSIGHT WHILE THE LATTER FOCUSED ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THERE WAS ALSO A REPORT BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHICH MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGES IN SERVICE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND ITS ACTIVITIES SEVERAL OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE CODIFIED WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB TEN SIXTY FOUR BY SENATOR ALL QUIST. IN. TWENTY TEN SIR BEGAN ISSUING GRANTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FIND NEW PROJECTS UNTIL SOMETIME IN. TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN WE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT AS THE HEARING -- PROCEEDS AS THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING OF THE LEGISLATURE ON CERN IN SEVERAL YEARS IT WOULD BE INFORMATIVE TO HEAR FROM TODAY'S PRESENTERS ABOUT WHAT SERVE HAS ACHIEVED ITS MISSION AND WEST PLANS ARE. FOR THE FUTURE AND BEFORE WE OPEN UP OUR INITIAL PANEL I'D LIKE TO SEE IF MY COLLEAGUE DR QUIRK -- HAS ANY INITIAL COMMENTS BOB THANK YOU A SHARE MULLIN. FOR HAVING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO LEARNING A LOT TODAY THANK YOU. EXCELLENT THANK YOUR DOCTOR QUIRK SO WITH THAT LET'S GET TO OUR FIRST PANEL WERE JOINED BY DOCTOR MARIA MALIGN C. E. O. OF SARM. SENATOR OUR TOUR AS A FAMILIAR FACE IN THIS BUILDING WHO IS THE VICE CHAIR OF TERMS GOVERNING BOARD AS WELL AS JOHN REED OF THE ROMAN READ FOUNDATION FOR SPINAL CORD. RESEARCH WELCOME AND THANK YOU ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S AN HONOR TO TO BE HERE DOCTOR QUIRK IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN AS WELL THANK YOU MRS AYE GOLLY FOR YOUR HELP IN PUTTING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TOGETHER. OF OUR BOARD IS COMPOSED OF OUR CHAIR DOCTOR JONATHAN THOMAS WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. AND TWENTY EIGHT BOARD MEMBERS A TEN OF WHOM ARE PATIENT ADVOCATES FOR VARIOUS DISEASES I BEING ONE OF THEM IS A COLON CANCER. SURVIVOR REPRESENTING CANCER AS EFFICACY ON THE ON THE BOARD. OF THERE'S YOU'VE BEEN INDICATED THE INITIATIVE WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR BY 59% OF THE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ISSUED A ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT IN. TWENTY TWELVE THAT FOUND THAT THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION INSERM GRANTS THAT HAD BEEN COMMITTED AS OF JULY OF TWENTY TWELVE AND THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION AND PRIVATE GENERATED MATCHING FARMS. FROM DONORS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS A ALLOWED US TO CREATE THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT FTA EASE AND CALIFORNIA OR ABOUT. FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO JOBS PER YEAR OVER THIS NINE YEAR PERIOD. AS A RESULT. OF OUR EFFORTS IN THESE FUNDS AND THESE AND THESE ARE MATCHING FUNDS WE'VE PAID THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION IN TAX REVENUES [inaudible] AND EIGHTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TAX REVENUES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACTIVITIES. AS WE KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS WHICH ARE MY FAVORITE AND THEY ARE. TO THE BRIDGES PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR INTERNSHIPS FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND WE HAVE HAD ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINE OF THE STUDENTS COME THROUGH THAT PROGRAM MANY OF WHOM ARE DIVERSE. MANY OF WHOM COULD NOT AFFORD TO STAY IN SCHOOL BUT FOR THE MINIMAL STIPEND THAT WE HAD PROVIDED THEM. AND ALSO TO WORK IN STEM CELL LABS FOR THE SUMMER. THAT WE OFFER THEM THAT'S STIPEND ALSO OFFER THEM AN OPPORTUNITY AND MANY OF THEM HAVE MOVED ON TO OTHER ACADEMIC ENDEAVORS AS A RESULT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE. AND HE'S LAPS AND THEN WE ALSO STARTED IT WHICH I HELPED START THE SPARK PROGRAM. WHICH WAS HERE TOO PINPOINTING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITHIN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ALSO PAY THEM A VERY SMALL INTERNSHIP AND SO FAR FIVE HUNDRED FORTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE AND YOU WOULD BE INSPIRED IN THRALL TO HEAR THESE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. TALK LIKE PHD CANDIDATES IN PRESENTING THEIR WORK THEY DID OVER THE SUMMER AS WE JUST HEARD A FEW WEEKS AGO OR LAST WEEK RATHER UC DAVIS. THESE ARE OUR FUTURE STEM CELLS SCIENTISTS WHICH WE HAVE TO NURTURE AND WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. A WE ALSO AND SENT YOU A VIDEO THAT EACH MEMBER WILL RECEIVE OF TWO OF OUR SPINAL CORD INJURY PATIENTS IN WHAT'S CALLED THE SCARIEST BIO THERAPEUTICS CLINICAL TRIALS. JACOB VIA FROM DANVILLE AND CHRIS BOATSWAIN FOR BAKERSFIELD. I YOU WILL DEFINITELY INSPIRED TO KNOW THAT JAKE IS NOW CAL POLLY. ASSEMBLY SO BISPO STUDY BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND DID RELEASE FOR ME ON HIS WHEELCHAIR. WHICH HE COULD NEVER DO THAT RIGHT AFTER THE INJURY AND CHRIS WAS THE FIRST PATIENT TREATED WITH TEN MILLION CELLS STEM CELLS. AND HAS EXPERIENCED THE MOST IMPROVEMENT VIDEO HE COULD NOW LIFT WEIGHTS AND HE COULD NOW BE MUCH MORE MOBILE THAN HE WAS ESPECIALLY AFTER THE AFTER THE ACCIDENT. AND SO I THINK IT'S IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE WHERE WERE MOVING THAT'S WHY OUR CEO IS IS HERE TODAY DOCTOR MARIA MILAN. IS A PHYSICIAN SCIENTIST WHO HAS DEVOTED HER LIFE TO DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR CHILDREN ADULTS WITH DEBILITATING LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS. SHE RECEIVED HER UNDERGRADUATE TO DO THAT ARE UP MEDICAL DOCTORAL RESEARCH AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL IN BOSTON. AND AFTERS A TRANSPLANT SURGERY FELLOWSHIP AT STANFORD SHE BEGAN HER ACADEMIC CAREER WITH THE BUSY VERY BUSY PEDIATRIC AND ADULT A TRANSPLANT SURGERY. PRACTICE IT WITHIN FIVE YEARS SHE WAS A OF A APPOINTED AS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF THE PEDIATRIC ORGAN TRANSPLANT PROGRAM. CHOOSE PUBLISHED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE AREA AND THEN WENT ON TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH ONE OF THE EARLIEST STEM CELL ORGANIZATIONS WHICH WAS THE FIRST STEM CELLS INK. TO ENTER INTO AN FDA REGULATED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH THE STEM CELL TREATMENT. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWELVE SHE REALLY LED THE EFFORT TO CREATE WHAT WE CALL THE ALPHA. CLINICS NETWORKS WHICH ARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS NOW SUPPORTING OVER FIFTY SIX CLINICAL TRIALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN JULY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE ON THE BOARD APPOINTED HER IS ARE. PRESIDENT CEO AND FORMALLY APPOINTED HER IN SEPTEMBER. TWENTY SEVENTEEN DR MILA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR TORRANCE FOR YOUR KIND INTRODUCTION MISTER SPEAKER. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY DOCTOR QUIRK -- IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY AND AN HONOR TO PRESENT AN UPDATE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. AT CERTAINLY NEVER FORET THAT WE WERE THIS AGENCY WAS FORMED BY THE BY THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION. PROPOSITION SEVENTY ONE BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IN OUR MISSION REMAINS TO ACCELERATE STEM CELL AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE TO PATIENTS WITH UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE TODAY IT SOMETIMES? QUITE AMAZING TO THINK THAT THE HUMAN STEM CELL WAS FIRST ISOLATED ONLY TWENTY YEARS AGO IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THIS OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW FIELD. BECAUSE THE STEM CELL HAD THE UNLIMITED CAPACITY TO PROLIFERATE AND TO GIVE RISE TO EVERY CELL IN THE BODY. THIS REALLY CAPTURED THE HUMAN IMAGINATION AND PROMINENT SCIENTISTS IN THE FIELD PROPOSED THAT THIS COULD ELUCIDATE. MECHANISMS AND HELP US SOLVE THE TOUGHEST MEDICAL DISEASES THAT THAT ARM ARE ARE DEVASTATING OUR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. AT THAT TIME IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND THERE ARE VERY FEW STEM CELL SCIENTISTS ARE VERY FEW. WHO COULD AFFORD TO PURSUE THIS LINE OF RESEARCH BECAUSE THERE'S SO IT JUST WAS NOT NOT ENOUGH FUNDING FOR THIS AND IT WAS SUCH A NEW FIELD? BECAUSE OF THE VISION OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA PATIENT ADVOCATES RESEARCHERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE WAS FORMED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AS YOU SAID BY THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION. SEVENTY ONE AND SINCE THEN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE LEADER IN THE FIELD AND REMAINS AT THE HELM AT THE FOREFRONT. OF WHAT'S NOW CONSIDERED OF MEDICAL REVOLUTION CALLED REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. WITH OUR TEAM OF HIGHLY TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS. STERN HAS DEVELOPED A WAY TO PARTNER WITH THE BEST ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY PROJECTS TO FAST TRACK THEM TO GET INTO THERAPEUTICS BY GOING THROUGH THE STAGES OF ARE BEING TESTED IN CLINICAL TRIALS. WITH OUR TIMELY AND EFFICIENT FUNDING PROCESS EXPERT REVIEWERS. ADVISORY RESOURCES CRITICAL STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE AN IN HOUSE EXPERTISE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE HIGHEST QUALITY PROGRAMS AND ACCELERATE THE PROGRESSION. TO TESTING A POTENTIAL CURATIVE TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF INDICATIONS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO TREATMENTS OR CURES. TO DATE CERTAIN HAS FOUND THAT OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PROJECTS THAT OVER IT SEVENTY INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IS THE LARGEST SINGLE FUNDER IN THE WORLD OF CLINICAL RESEARCH FOR STEM CELL AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE LAUNCHED A BOLD FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN. A PLAN WAS CREATED SO THAT WE COULD DELIBERATELY AND STRATEGICALLY CUT THE TIME AND HALF THAT IT WOULD TAKE. TO GET THE RESEARCH TO GO THROUGH THE STAGES TO GET INTO THE CLINICS IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S MEANT TO GO TO THE CLINICS. AND WE ALSO STRATEGICALLY CREATED A WAY TO BRING IN THE HIGHEST. ATTENTION ALL PROJECTS AND TO BUILD A WORLD CLASS PORTFOLIO OF CLINICAL PROJECTS THAT WE HAD MORE SHOTS ON GOAL TO SOLVE THESE DEBILITATING -- DISEASES AND CONDITIONS FOR WHICH THERE IS NO TREATMENT OR CURE. TODAY SIR ARM HAS FUNDED FORTY NINE FDA REGULATED CLINICAL TRIALS AND IS FUNDED THE TREATMENT OF OVER NINE HUNDRED PATIENTS IN THESE CLINICAL TRIALS. FOR A BROAD RANGE OF INDICATIONS INCLUDING FATAL PEDIATRIC ORPHAN DISEASES STROKE. THE GUARDS DISEASE ALS SPINAL CORD INJURY AS YOU HEARD ABOUT HEART DISEASE. CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANT ADVANCED CANCERS [inaudible] DIABETES. BLINDING EYE DISEASE. SICKLE CELL DISEASE JUST TO NAME A FEW. IN THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS I JUST LIKE THE HIGHLIGHT. THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT SERMONS PARTNERED. THESE INNOVATIVE HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD PROP PROGRAMS THAT. SERRANO WAS UNIQUELY DESIGNED TO ACCELERATE AND TO PARTNER WITH IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS TO GETTING TO PATIENTS. THE FIRST EXAMPLE WE HAVE -- YOU OUT ME LATER ON A REPRESENTATIVE -- FOR A PATIENT WHO IS ENROLLED IN THIS TRIAL. AND ONE OF THE TRIALS WHERE FUNDING. TRIALS AND THREE DIFFERENT FORMS OF A GENETIC DISEASE CALLED SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY. WHERE BABIES ARE BORN WITHOUT FUNCTIONAL IMMUNE SYSTEM SO THE COMMON COLD COULD RESULT IN FATAL COMPLICATIONS? THE PROGRAMS WHERE FUNDING ARE USING THE BABY'S OWN STEM CELLS. JEAN ENGINEERING THEM SO THEY CAN CORRECT THE GENE DEFECT THAT LEADS TO THE IMMUNE DEFICIENCY. GIVING THEM BACK TO THE PATIENTS WHERE THE STEM CELLS BECAUSE OF THE REMARKABLE QUALITY HOME TO THE BONE MARROW WHICH IS THEIR USUAL HOME. AND GIVE RISE TO TO THE ARM FUNCTIONAL IMMUNE CELLS AND THE BABY IS ESSENTIALLY CAN HOW THESE REPLAYED IT THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE BECAUSE THE STEM CELLS HAVE THE ABILITY. TO CONTINUE TO PERSIST AND GIVE RISE TO NEW SELF. AS THE BABY GROWS. YOU WILL HEAR FROM BABY RONNIE'S FAMILY. WHO IS AND BABY RONNIE WHAT WAS ENROLLED IN A TRIAL AT UCSF -- FOR EXPLAINED SKIT. AND IN OUR COVER OF OUR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ANNUAL AND BABY RONNIE'S ON OUR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ANNUAL REPORT WHICH YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- IN OUR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ANNUAL REPORT WE HAD A PICTURE OF OF EP WHO IS NOW FIVE YEARS OUT FROM. HER TRANSPLANT WITH THE THE SIMILAR APPROACH FOR HER FORM OF SKID CALLED ABA SKID SHE'S CURED SHE HAS A FULLY FUNCTIONAL IMMUNE SYSTEM. SHE IT GOES TO SCHOOL AND HIS DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY MEDICATIONS WHATSOEVER SOVIET HER PARENTS ARE -- VERY VERY -- VISIBLE ON THE CAN YOU. AREA OF HOW IT HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES NOW SHE THE MOTHER HER MOTHER DOESN'T HAVE TO HOLD THEIR BREATH ANY TIME EVEY TOUCHES SOMETHING OR THEY CAN GO OUT IN PUBLIC WITHOUT FEELING LIKE -- OF BEING USING A PUBLIC RESTROOM MAY LEAD TO HERS HER DAUGHTER'S DEMISE. THIS PROJECT IS IN ITS PIVOTAL PHASE MEANING THAT ONCE THIS TRIAL IS COMPLETE THE DATA WILL BE EVALUATED BY THE FDA. AND DETERMINE WHETHER IT WILL GO OUT FOR MARKETING APPROVAL AND BE MADE MORE AVAILABLE -- TO ALL PATIENTS OUTSIDE OF A CLINICAL TRIAL. SO THE ENCOURAGING RESULTS WITH SKIT. PROVIDES A PROOF OF PRINCIPLE FOR THIS INCREDIBLE PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE FIELD. CURATIVE ONE TIME TREATMENT. USING THE PATIENT'S OWN STEM CELLS. THIS GIVES US TRUE HOPE. FOR THE OTHER ESTIMATED TEN THOUSAND HUMAN DISEASES THAT ARE DUE TO SINGLE GENE MUTATIONS FOR WHICH SUCH AN APPROACH COULD ALSO BE USED. TO CORRECT THEM. AND THE SECOND EXAMPLE I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A DIFFERENT THERAPEUTIC APPROACH WHICH COMBINES. SURGICAL ADVANCES WITH. STEM CELLS GENE THERAPY. WE FIND A DOCTOR TO BE MACKENZIE AT UCSF SHE'S A PEDIATRIC SURGEON AND A RESEARCHER. WHO'S A DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE TREAT BABIES WHO HAVE ALFA THALASSEMIA WHICH IS A FATAL BLOOD CONDITION. OFTEN THESE BABIES DON'T MAKE IT TO FULL TERM THEY'RE LOST IN EURO AND I A MISCARRIAGE. SHE TREATS THE SPEED OF SAYS WHILE STILL ON THE MOTHER'S WOMB WITH. MATERNAL STEM CELL TRANSPLANT THE BABIES BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL HAVE THE MUSE SYSTEM TO ACCEPT THE MOTHER STEM CELLS. CAN ACCEPT THE STEM CELLS AND GIVE RISE TO NORMAL BLOOD CELLS. THE IDEA IS TO BRING THE BABIES TO FULL TERM. AND THE ULTIMATE. GOAL IS TO HAVE THEM BE FULLY CURED BUT SHOULD THEY REQUIRE TRANSPLANT AFTER BIRTH NOW THEY'RE TOLERANCE TO THE MOTHER SO WHEN THEY GET THE TRANSPLANT IF THEY NEEDED EVERY DOES AFTER TRANSPLANT. THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE CELLS. THIS STORY ALONG WITH THE PICTURE OF A VERY PINK AND CUTE THREE WE CALLED WHO WAS THE FIRST PATIENT ENROLLED IN THIS TRIAL WAS FEATURED. AND ON IN THE MAY TWENTY FIFTH ISSUE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES. AND WHAT THAT CHILD IS STILL ON GOING BUT IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING. MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD -- THE EXCITEMENT AROUND IMMUNOTHERAPY AND CARTY THERAPIES. AND AS YOU KNOW TWO OF THE FIRST IN KIND. ON PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA JUSTICE PAST YEAR FOR THE TREATMENT OF LEUKEMIA AND LYMPHOMA. WHILE ALL THIS WAS IN DEVELOPMENT STURM SCIENTISTS HAD ALREADY BEEN WORKING ON A WAY TO OUR CREATE STEM CELL ARE IMMUNE CELLS. USING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO HAVE A DURABLE AFFECT A LOT AGAINST THE TOUGHEST SOLID CANCERS SUCH OF THE BRAIN CANCER. GLIOBLASTOMA. AND CERTAIN LUNG CANCERS. THE PROGRAM AT CITY OF HOPE AT CITY OF HOPE. HIS TARGETING GLIOBLASTOMA A DATE DEADLY BRAIN CANCER AND IT'S IT'S IT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL JOURNAL OF MEDICINE FOR IT. SOME REMARKABLE RESULTS AN INITIAL PATIENTS. THIS PROJECT IS THOSE ALSO NOTABLE BECAUSE IT'S OUR SOURCE OF THE FIRST ROYALTY CHECK DUE TO A PARTNERSHIP OF THIS PROGRAM WITH A COMMERCIAL ENTITY. THAT WAS TO BAN THAT WHENCE I HAVE -- AWARDED TO THE STATE IN DECEMBER. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PROJECT THAT WE HAVE IS SPECTACULAR AND AND JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED SCIENCE FICTION. BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A SAMPLING FOR SOME OF THE DAY ON TYPES OF PROGRAMS WE HAVE. WE HAVE OTHER TYPES OF SELF THERAPY AND JEAN PROGRAMS ARE AGAINST. THE MOST TOUGH INDICATION DISEASE STROKE AND NEUROLOGIC DISEASE AS SO WHERE ARE WE TODAY WE'RE QUITE ENCOURAGED THAT THERE THERE'S SO MUCH. PROGRESS BEING MADE IN THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL MORE TO DO. I'M NOT ONLY WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES BUT IN THE NEXT WAVE OF INNOVATION [inaudible] SO. JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND DOCTOR SHINYA YAMANAKA WHO'S ONE OF THAT STORM FUNDED -- SCIENTISTS AT THE GLADSTONE INSTITUTE AT UCSF HAD RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FOR HIS DISCOVERY THAT ADULT STEM CELLS. OUR OWN SKIN CELLS OR BLOOD DRAWS CELLS OBTAINED FROM BLOOD DRAWS CAN BE REPROGRAMMED. BY RESETTING THE JEANS TO BECOME STEM CELL LIKE. SO THAT THOSE CELLS THAT YOU REPROGRAM FROM CELLS COMING FROM AS A SKIN BIOPSY. CAN DOWN POTENTIALLY GIVE YOU AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF THESE PLURIPOTENCY MEANING CAN BE TURNED INTO OTHER CELLS SO THIS. PROSPECT OF HAVING READILY AVAILABLE CELLS THAT CAN BE USED FOR SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY AT TECHNOLOGIES I JUST DESCRIBED. AS WELL AS FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AS A QUITE. EXCITING ITS STILL IN ITS EARLY FANS WE STILL DON'T HAVE A TRIAL IN THE U. S. FOR I PSC ARM DERIVED CELLS THERAPEUTICS. DOCTOR YAMANAKA AS WELL AS OTHER SCIENTISTS ARE CONTINUING TO DO THE WORK TO OPTIMIZE CONDITIONS TO THESE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE USED SAFELY IN PATIENTS. IT IS A TANGIBLE AND UNFOUNDED HOPE THAT THESE POOR UPON STEM CELLS COULD GIVE RISE TO THE NEXT WAVE OF THERAPIES. AND IN FACT IN JAPAN ON THERE ARE READY EARLY TRIALS LOOKING AT I PSC THAT CAN BE TURNED INTO NERVE CELLS THAT EXPRESSED DOPAMINE WHICH IS MISSING AND PARKINSON'S. AS AN APPROACH TO PARKINSON'S DISEASE. THIS TECHNIQUE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THE AYE PSE TECHNOLOGY AWARD HIGHER THE TYPE OF EARLY INVESTMENT. EXPERTISE IN TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AND SPECIALIZED SYSTEMS BUT SERMONS PUT INTO PLACE. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE WITH JUST TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] HOUSE TERMS. PROCESSES AND VALUE PROPOSITION HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AND BY OTHERS OUTSIDE OF SPERM IN INDUSTRY. IN THE PAST INDUSTRY IN TRADITIONAL INVESTORS HAVE BEEN AND ARE NOT VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT COMING IN EARLY SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SCIENCE WAS. TO TWO YOUNG -- THERE WERE TOO MANY UNKNOWNS AND IT WAS A FINANCIAL RISK. SO SIR ARM PLAYED THE ROLE OF QUOTE UNQUOTE DE RISKING MEANING WE FOUND THE BEST SCIENCE -- FUNDED THE INVESTIGATORS TO PURSUE IT SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO A STAGE WHERE THEY CAN TEST IT AND A PROOF OF CONCEPT. USING THIS MODEL. WERE VERY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THIS HAS. ATTRACTED INDUSTRY INVESTORS AND PARTNERSHIPS COMMERCIALIZATION PARTNERSHIPS FOR PROGRAMS AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THIS. A PROJECT THAT WE US SUPPORTED AT STANFORD IN ITS EARLY DAYS WHILE STILL ON THE BENCH. WAS BASED ON A CONCEPT THAT THEIR CANCER STEM CELLS SO KIND OF THE EVIL TWIN OF THE OTHER STEM CELLS. AND WE FUNDED THIS WHEN THE CONCEPT WAS STILL DEBATED IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. TODAY IT'S NO LONGER DEBATED IT'S ACCEPTED THAT THERE ARE CANCERS STEM CELLS THAT THEY ARE CRITICAL TO TARGET IF YOU'RE GONNA TRULY YOUR THESE CANCERS. AND ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT WAS THAT LICENSE THIS TECHNOLOGY HAD JUST GONE PUBLIC RECENTLY AFTER RAISING A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCING. SO IT MADE IT ALL THE WAY FROM THE BENCH TO THE BEDSIDE TO A COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIP. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF HOUSE ARMED DOLLARS HAVE BEEN LEVERAGED TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. JUST A BED OVER HALF OF THE HALF WAY MARK THIS YEAR ALONE. WE'VE RECORDED OVER FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENTS INTO OUR PROGRAMS. BRINGING OUR GRAND TOTAL TO OVER ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND INDUSTRY INVESTMENT INTO SOME FUNDED PROGRAMS. IN FACT FOR THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS INSTRUMENT WARRANTS. THIS HAS BEEN LEVERAGED TO BRING IN AN APPROXIMATE TWO POINTS MATCHING TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN MATCHING FUNDS. AND INVESTMENTS. FROM OTHER SOURCES. AND THE LAST -- TO KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE ARE CRAFTING ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BRINGING THESE EFFORTS TO A GLOBAL STAGE. WE HAVE FORMED PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE AND NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH JUST RECENTLY WE SIGNED. A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. BECAUSE AND I H. RECOGNIZES THAT'S TERMS EXPERTISE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM. ARGUE NEATLY DESIGNED TO BRING SCIENCE ALL THE WAY THROUGH DEVELOPMENT SOMETHING THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET TO ESPECIALLY IN THIS YOUNG FIELD. SO THEY'VE PARTNERED WITH US IN THEIR FIVE YEAR CURE SICKLE CELL INITIATIVE WHERE THEY WILL RELY ON OUR EXPERTISE AND OUR FUNDING MECHANISMS IN ORDER TO HELP BRING THE BEST SCIENCE FORD. PROCURED TO CURE SICKLE CELL. THE FDA THAT HAS WHO HAVE LAUNCHED -- THE REGENERATIVE MEDICINE ADVANCED THERAPY DESIGNATION FOR ACCELERATING -- DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TYPE OF THERAPIES HAD GRANTED A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH NUMBER OF THESE DESIGNATIONS OF THESE ACCELERATE PATHWAY TO STORM FUNDED PROGRAMS. IN FACT OF THE FIRST THREE PROGRAMS THAT THE PROGRAM JUST STARTED LAST YEAR. OF THE FIRST THREE PROGRAMS TO HAVE A MORE SARM -- OF THE FIRST FIFTEEN OR SO FOUR OF THEM WERE SOME PROGRAMS. SO THAT'S IN THE ENTIRE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. OKAY AT PROMINENT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES. LEADERS FROM OTHER. ORGANIZATIONS TO COME UP TO SARM. AND ARTICULATED THEIR NEED FOR A CERTAIN TO SUCCEED THEY PERHAPS STATED YOUR SUCCESS IS OUR SUCCESS OF THIS FIELD IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. THEY ARE RELYING ON US TO MAINTAIN A LEADERSHIP POSITION AND TO MAINTAIN A ROBUST ACTIVITIES. YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE ALPHA CLINICS NETWORK -- THAT WE'VE THAT WAS FORMED PASSED LIKE THREE YEARS AGO THEY FUNDING WE HAVE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING FIFTY SIX CLINICAL TRIALS BUT MORE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THESE ARE AMBASSADORS INTO HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE BROUGHT INTO MEDICAL PRACTICE. AND THEY AND AND AND INTO THE INSTITUTIONS IN A SAFE MANNER -- AND WITH AID LEARNING AND SOURCES. IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ALL THESE PROGRAMS REPRESENT NOVEL MANUFACTURING BY A MANUFACTURING UP CAPACITY THAT IS BEING BUILT IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT SPUN OUT OF OUR PROGRAMS BUILT TO MANUFACTURING PROGRAMS APPEAR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN CONCLUSION SIR CALIFORNIA'S THE BIRTH PLACE OF BY ATTACK. BIOTECH BEING AN INDUSTRY THAT USES THE NATURAL BIOLOGY OF MICROORGANISMS TO PRODUCE THERAPIES. CALIFORNIA IT'S NOW THE LEAD IN THE NEW FIELD OF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. I FEEL THAT HARNESSES THE NATURAL BIOLOGY OF THE HUMAN CELL TO PRODUCE THERAPIES. THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ARM UNTREATABLE AND INCURABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU DOCTOR A LOT FOR THE OVERVIEW AND YOU MENTIONED BIRTH PLACE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY MY HOMETOWN SAW SEVEN CISCO IS THE BIRTH. I WAS ON THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOR THIS AND IT ANYTIME ANY OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE MENTIONED THAT WE MENTIONED ITSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WHAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WE HAVE BEEN JOINED BY A COUPLE OF MY ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER TODD GLORIA. AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARIE WALDRON THANK YOU BOTH. FOR BEING HERE THEY HAIL FROM THE SAN DIEGO REGION -- THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE -- THANK YOU DOCTOR MALIGNED LET'S TURN -- TO DAWN READ WITH THE ROMAN READ FOUNDATION FOR SPINAL CORD RESEARCH AND THEN WE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK OUR PANEL SOME QUESTIONS IF WE MAY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. I'M THE FATHER OF PARALYZE YOUNG MAN FROM AND READ AND THE AUTHOR OF TWO BOOKS ON THE CALIFORNIA STEM CELL PROGRAM. IF YOU HAVE A CHRONIC DISEASE OR PROVIDE CARE FOR SOMEONE WHO DOES. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE TO BE TOLD THE CONDITION IS INCURABLE THERE IS NO HOPE. BUT BOB PLAYING INSPIRED AND LED THE CITIZENS INITIATIVE PROPOSITION SEVENTY ONE TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE DID HAVE HOPE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. STEM CELL RESEARCH MIGHT ALLEVIATE OR CURE MANY CHRONIC ILLS AFFLICTING OUR LOVED ONES. TODAY THANKS THE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION VOTERS WHO AUTHORIZED THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE OR SIR. WE HAVE SOMETHING BETTER THAN HOPE. WE HAVE RESULTS ACCOMPLISHMENTS PEOPLE MADE WELL AND A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO FIGHT CHRONIC DISEASE. HOW DOES IT WORK SCIENTISTS APPLY FOR GRANTS ABORTED EXPERTS FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE EVALUATES PROPOSALS? IN HOW SCIENTISTS GIVE THEIR OPINIONS AND INDEPENDENT CITIZENS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THE BOARD. WITH THE HELP OF THE PUBLIC MAKES THE FINAL DECISION. KAREN DISEASE IS NOT FAST NOTHING IS GUARANTEED THERE WILL BE SETBACKS. BUT THE CERTAIN WAY IS LIKE A FARMER PLANTING SEEDS. RESULTS DO NOT COME OVERNIGHT. BUT THE PROP PREPARATIONS ARE DONE PROPERLY CURES. LIKE CROPS CAN BECOME ALMOST INEVITABLE. IT IS HAPPENING NOW. THERAPIES ARE DANCING. PATIENTS ARE BENEFITING KNOWLEDGE IS BEING SHARED OVER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED MEDICAL DISCOVERIES HAVE BEEN PEER REVIEWED AND PUBLISHED IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS. PIECES OF THE PUZZLE OF CARE. CHILDREN'S LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED THIRTY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE MUNCHKINS WHO CAN NOW RUN AROUND OUTSIDE. BEGIN THE SUNSHINE CURED ACTUALLY CURED OF THE BUBBLE BABY SYNDROME BEFORE THEY HAD NO IMMUNE SYSTEM NOW THEY DO. A YOUNG MAN CHRIS POISON FORMALLY COMPLETELY PARALYZED IS NOW LIFTING WEIGHTS. HE RECEIVED A STEM CELL THERAPY ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY THE ROMAN REED SPINAL CORD INJURY RESEARCH ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND ADVANCED BY SIR. CHRIS POISSON RECOVERED THE USE OF HIS ARMS AND HANDS THINK WHAT THAT MEANS TO PARALYZE PERSON. RENDON WHITTAKER HAD GRANULOMATOSIS DISEASE A VICIOUS CONDITION WHICH EATS AWAY THE LUNGS AND LIVER. HIS EARLY YEARS INVOLVED LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF TRIPS TO THE HOSPITAL. HIS CHANCES OF SURVIVING TO ADULTHOOD WHICH WHEN HE HAD THE DEATH SENTENCE. BUT TODAY THANKS TO THERAPIES DEVELOPED WITH ALBUS ARM BRENDAN WOULD OCCUR LIVES. WANTING TO PAY BACKS TERM FOR HIS LIFE. HE DECIDED TO BECOME A DOCTOR NOW HE WILL HAVE ENOUGH YEARS FOR THAT CAREER. SAM IS PART OF MY FAVORITE MEDICAL RESEARCH STORY IN TORONTO CANADA THREE SCIENTISTS ENTERED A BIG ROOM FULL OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND BEDS. WITH THEIR FAMILIES AROUND THEM THE CHILDREN WHEN CALMNESS UNRESPONSIVE DYING. BUT THE SCIENTIST HAD A NEW SUBSTANCE TO TRY MAY FROM THE PANCREAS IS OF DOGS. WITH THE PARENTS PERMISSION THEY START AT ONE END OF THE ROOM INJECTING THE COMATOSE PATIENTS. WHEN THEY REACHED THE FAR END THE CHILDREN WHO GOT THE SHOT FIRST WERE SITTING UP AND TALKING TO THEIR ASTONISHED PARENTS? IT WAS INSULIN AND SAVE THEIR LIVES. BUT EVEN SO ALTHOUGH SHOTS THIS WITH A TEMPORARY FIX NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA DEVELOPED ARTIFICIAL INSULIN AND TODAY SERMON IS BUILDING ON THAT LEGACY. DEVELOP SOMETHING LIKE AN ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS TO BE PERMANENTLY IMPLANTED IN THE BODY WEARABLE CONVERT STEM CELLS AND INSULIN. AS FOR BERMAN MY SON CURE IS NOT COME YET. HE REMAINS PARALYZED WITH A CHRONIC INJURY AND I AM HIS CAREGIVER. AT SEVENTY THREE MY HEALTH IS GOOD. BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIM WHEN I DIE. I ACHE FOR HIM TO BE WELL TO DO ALL THE THINGS ABLE BODIED FOLK TAKE FOR GRANTED. NO ONE SHOULD SUFFER WHEN HE GOES TO EVERY DAY. AND CALIFORNIA'S THREE MILLION CITIZENS WITH A DISABILITY. MAYBE IN YEARS TO COME WASHINGTON WILL BECOME MORE RESPONSIVE TO MEDICAL NEEDS OF ALL OUR PEOPLE. INCLUDING THE 50% OF OUR POPULATION LIVING WITH AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC DISEASE LIKE HEART DISEASE CANCER STROKE OR DIABETES. BUT HOPE IS NOT ENOUGH WE CANNOT SIT IDLY BY AND JUST WAIT. WE NEED SOMETHING PROVEN PRACTICAL AND HERE RIGHT NOW SERVE. THE GLORY OF THE STATE PRIDE OF OUR NATION A FRIEND WHILE THE WORLD. PLEASE DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO SUPPORT PROTECT AND RENEW THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR JANET MEDICINE THANK YOU. JENNIFER IF I MAY USE ON THAT ON THAT POINT MR GLORIA'S DISTRICT. A VICE SITE COMPANIES LOCATED AND IT'S ALL FOUND WORKING IN THIS VERY TREATMENT A CURE FOR DIABETES. WE SPENT OVER FORTY BILLION AND STATE ALONE A DIABETIC CARE SO WE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT IT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS. A POSSIBILITY WHAT I'D NOW LIKE TO HAVE YOU ASKED THE POPE WASH THE FATHER OF OF RONNIE TO END OUR PRESENTATION IF YOU CAN DO THAT. ARE THEY HERE. HOPE. THESE ARE THE PARENTS OF LOOK FOR THEIR FUTURE TO THE FRONT PAGE OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT. THANK YOU MISREAD AND GIVE GIVE OUR BEST TO YOUR SON AS WELL. HERE THEY COME [inaudible] THESE [inaudible] BENEFIBER SELF [inaudible] YES YEAH HI MY NAME IS SOUTH OF WASHINGTON [inaudible] AND HE'S [inaudible] AT IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT -- HI MY NAME IS BUT WASHED AND HE'S MY SON -- DO ENOUGH TO SHIP. NOW WE GOT HIM RONNIE -- AND YES HE'S MY WIFE PLACENTA -- YEAH HE HE WAS GONE -- IN MARCY FALL SOME MERCY HOSPITAL FOLLOWED SOME -- ON NOW MY TWO NINE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND IT WAS A GREAT DAY EVERYTHING WAS GOING VERY GOOD. AND FORTUNATELY WE HAVE A NEWBORN SCREENING IN CALIFORNIA WHICH YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY AFTER LIKE FIVE DAYS OFF THAT SCREENING HE WAS DEPICTED AS GOOD -- SIVA COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE WORD WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM. WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE GO LATE THEN? NOTHING GOOD WAS COMING OUT OF IT -- YOU KNOW HOW WE WE SAW. AND WIKIPEDIA THAT IT'S SAFE BUBBLE BOY A DISEASE AND I REMEMBER WATCHING ONE OF THE IN EPISODE OF SEINFELD HAVING ABOUT WILL BLAME IT SO I WAS REALLY WHAT IT WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS GOING ON AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE SHAKEN UP -- THAT IS WHEN -- YOU KNOW LIKE GUM -- WE CAME INTO. I'M AS WE GOT A CALL FROM MOM UCSF FROM ONE OF THE DOCTORS DOCTOR JENNIFER BUG THAT YOU KNOW WE COULD. YOU HAVE TO BRING HIM OVER HERE BECAUSE ANY KIND OF INFECTION COULD KILL HIM -- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TOO MANY WEEKS. EVEN NOT MANY LIKE MAYBE SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS TO SURVIVE BECAUSE HE HAS ANTIBODIES FROM HIS MOTHER AS OF NOW. BUT AS AS HE GROWS UP BUT AS HE AS THE DAYS PASS IS ON IF YOU GET ANY KIND OF INFECTION IT WOULD BE HARD TO SURVIVE. SO -- IT WAS IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING IT WAS LIKE -- YOU KNOW BY JUST QUITE WITH IT ALL SHAKEN UP AND MY MOM WAS HERE FROM INDIA. SHE WAS ALSO SHAKEN UP AND DOWN WE EVENTUALLY WE LANDED UP TO UCSF AND WE FOUND. YOU KNOW THAT NOT MANY TREATMENTS DAD HOW WE'VE BEEN OFFERED BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT FROM ME TO HIM. NOW IT WAS THE FIRST AUDITION BUT THEN -- BLESSING IN DISGUISE HE WAS. FOUND AS ACTS LINK TO SKATE WITH FOR THE TESTING. AND THAT IS WHEN WE CAME TO KNOW THAT -- SADDAM IS [inaudible] TRY [inaudible] SKID AND AND AND LOOKS LIKE THAT IS THAT IS REALLY SUCCESSFUL EVERYTHING IS GOING FINE AND AND ALSO WE WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF STARCH ON THE GENE THERAPY AND WE FOUND THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THERE WOULD BE THE FIX ON THE YOU KNOW DNA AND THAT COULD COME OUT OF FOR ANI WILL FIX THE THING BECAUSE OF WHICH HE'S DE SALES AND HIS BE SO THAT ARE GROWING UP. SO WE WERE REALLY THINKING YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHICH CAN GO FROM ME TO HIM GOOD PRO PROBABLY BECAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN HIM BUT SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN FIX AND HAM AND WHEN IT'S GIVEN BACK TO HIM PROBABLY THAT WOULDN'T THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY KIND OF PROBLEMS OUT. OF IT. SO THAT WAS A POSITIVE ATTITUDE THAT WE ALSO HAD AND PLUS WE'RE TALKING TO ALL THE DOCTORS OVER THERE. AND ALSO WE HEARD ABOUT THE GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE SITUATION WITH THE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT WHICH WAS REALLY. TIGHTENING AND WE'VE AT HITTING LOT OF INFECTIONS HAPPENING AFTER THAT. SO GENE THERAPY WAS REALLY. THE WAY TO GO AND THANK YOU TO YOU KNOW SORRY MAN THANK YOU -- TO EVERYONE WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ARTS THE UMP CLINICAL TRIALS TOWARDS THE OF FINDING THE SOLUTION TO THIS. I YOU KNOW DEADLY DISEASE -- WE WE DID THE GENE THERAPY ON JUNE EIGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND AND THAT WAS THAT WAS REALLY A BLESSING DAY FOR US WE STARTED WE CAN PLACE THE CELLS TO GROW UP. AND BY BY SEPTEMBER FIFTH. HE HAD FUNCTIONAL. MORE THAN 5% OF THE CELLS IN HIS BODY. AND BY SEPTEMBER TALKING WEAVER SAID THAT YOU KNOW BY UCS OF THAT YOU CAN NOW LET CAN GO OUT. PLAY AROUND ENJOYED THE BOY THEN YOU KNOW SEE AROUND SO SEPTEMBER THIRTEEN WE GOT DISCHARGED FROM UCSF AND HE HAS BEEN HE HAS BEEN DOING GREAT HE'S VERY ACTIVE CHILD. HE IS BE CELLS OF ALSO COME UP NOW -- LIKE LAST MONTH. AND DEBBIE CELLS ARE GROWING VERY FAST SO WE ARE PLANNING TO A STOP THE THAT THAT IS THAT IS ANTIBODIES THAT WE GIVE HIM EVERY MONTH -- BECAUSE HIS BECAUSE OF THAT OUR DEBT IT'S CALLED IVY ID. AND DOCTORS UP RUNNING TO STOP THAT AS WELL SO HE'S DIESEL THAT FULLY FUNCTIONAL USE DIESEL HAVE COMPLETELY GROWN UP LIKE A NOT MUCH I HE IS PLAYING AROUND HIS GOING AROUND HE HAS BEEN TO CROWDS HE HAS BEEN TO ALL THE MALLS. USING FANTASTICALLY WELL USING VERY GOOD. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU TO SHOW HIM WHO HAS. YOU KNOW WHO HAS BEEN AYE AYE AYE WAS THAT AND I'M IN ONE OF THE MEETINGS IN OAKLAND AND I SAW. THAT ALL THAT LEGAL TRIES WITH SON HAS BEEN. FUNDING AND I'M I'M REALLY BLESSED AND WE ARE REALLY BLESSED TO IN A ACCORDING TO ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AND YOUR BE YOUR BABY BOY IS A BEAUTIFUL COVER. ON THE ON THE SERB ANNUAL REPORTS A THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AND WE WE WISH YOU. ALL THE BEST TO GET IT RIGHT. SO WE DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS PERHAPS FOR THE FOR THE A PANEL AND I'D WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES SINCE DOCTOR PARK SHOWED A FIRST WILL GIVE DOCTOR QUIRK THE FIRST QUESTION SHOW FOR A DOCTOR MILIND PRETTY PREENCHER LESSENING THE LAN MILAN. FARM. BR QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE CURRENT FEDERAL POLICY ON STEM CELL RESEARCH. I KNOW THAT INITIALLY -- THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SAID ONLY CERTAIN CELL LINES HAD ALREADY BEEN PRODUCED COULD BE YEARS [inaudible] VAN. ALTHOUGH I THINK IT WAS AN EFFORT ON THAT ON THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO OPEN IT UP SOME OF THE THINGS THEY DID. LIKE -- HAVING -- A CLEAR JUST -- DISCLOSURE TO THE PEOPLE WHO DONATED THEIR CELLS SOME OF THOSE LINES FAN COULDN'T BE USED IT CETERA SO WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE STATE OF WHAT OTHER. IS THE FEDERAL RESEARCH ARE [inaudible] HAVE ARTIFICIAL. OF RESTRAINTS SUCH AS WE TALKED ABOUT IS IT BEING A FUNDED OUT WHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION SO -- SOME OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED -- BUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS EVEN WITH THAT THE NIH FOR INSTANCE IS STILL NOT FUNDING GENERALLY SOME OF THAT THE EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH. A STURM IS FINDING EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH BUT ALSO. DISCOVERIES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL HI MATIC GENE MODIFIED -- HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL THAT WE SPOKE UP -- SO WHERE MORE DIVERSE AND THE TYPES OF STEM CELL -- RESEARCH THAT WERE. SUPPORTING IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS BEING SUPPORTED NATIONALLY. THEN IN RONNIE'S CASE YOU ALSO RE USING GENETIC ENGINEERING. ARM. WERE USING VIRUSES TO OKC USING IRISES IT WOULD HAVE ATLANTIC VIRAL -- FACT THAT THERE WAS A VIRAL SO IT'S A VIRAL THAT BECOMES. INCAPACITATED IN TERMS OF ITSELF BEING INFECTIOUS BUT IT JUST SERVES AS A VEHICLE TO DELIVER THE JEAN -- BUT I DON'T USES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT WE HAVE SOME UP PROGRAMS WITHIN WITH AND THAT NEXT GENERATION JEAN EDITING CALLED CRISPER RIGHT WE'VE ALL HEARD OF FOR VARIOUS INDICATIONS AS WELL -- SO. THERE'S QUITE IT'S JUST MOVING AT LIGHTNING SPEED IN TERMS OF THE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE SPECIFICITY BY WHICH GENES CAN BE EDITED AND THAT -- BUT THERE IS SOME QUITE A BIT OF ACTIVITY AROUND OF GETTING THE BEST FACTORS MAKING THIS SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S PRACTICAL THAT CAN BE CREATED INTO A PRODUCT THAT. IS NOT SO CUMBERSOME THAT IT'S NOT PRACTICALLY ABLE TO GET OUT THE PATIENTS SO THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KIND OF THE UNDERLYING ACTIVITIES BEHIND THE SCIENTIFIC AS WELL AS THE CLINICAL TRIAL. ARE ALL OF THOSE COMPONENTS ACTIONS ON FLORA. STEM CELLS. OTHER RESEARCH OF THAT TYPE. I'M GENE THERAPY RESEARCH WELL GENE THERAPY BUT JUST THE U. SUPPLIER PLOWDEN STEM CELLS OPPOSED EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS. NOT NOT CURRENT IN TERMS OF THE INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS NUMBER NO OF RESTRICTIONS ON THAT IS JUST THE SCIENCE THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO MATURE. AND WHAT I HAD MENTIONED KINDA BRIEFLY -- WHAT UNIQUELY THIS STORM DOES PURSES WHAT THAT OTHER AGENCIES THAT SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH FROM? WHAT IT'S REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE BECAUSE THERE MAY BE? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TYPE OF RESEARCH HAS BEEN FUND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEING FUNDED? BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO THE SCIENTISTS BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY HAVE THE SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WE GET THIS SO IT DEVELOPED INTO SOMETHING WE GET TOUGH IN A CLINICAL TRIAL NOTED THAT. THAT. THAT KIND OF PHASE CALLED THE TRANSLATIONAL PHASE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE NIH ARM IS DON'T REALLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY IN THIS. IN THIS ARENA COUNTY THAT'S TERM HAD THAT BIG WE BECAME SPECIALIST SENATE AND THE THE REASON THAT THEY ARE PARTNERING WITH US FOR THE CURE SICKLE CELL INITIATIVE AND WERE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP. BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT WE JUST HAD IT WAS BUILT BY DESIGN FOR THESE TYPE OF TREATMENTS TO GET THEM OUT TO THE PATIENTS. SO -- I THINK THAT IT WOULD REGARDLESS OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE WHAT WE HAVE IS A VERY RELIABLE SYSTEM. AND VERY DE LA DEEP EXPERT INTERNALLY AS WELL AS WITH OUR SCIENTIFIC REVIEWERS AND ADVISERS -- REGULATORY ADVISORS DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS TO HELP US WITH ALL THESE PROGRAMS OKAY WE'VE CONVINCED ME YOU HAVE A UNIQUE SPOT IN THE I RESEARCH ENVELOPMENT AREA THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU DUCT WORK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I'M JUST ALWAYS SO ENERGIZED WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE NEW INNOVATIONS OF SYSTEM CREDIBLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD LEARNED IN THE PAST -- WHEN I DID IT SEVERAL TOURS UMP OF DIFFERENT -- COMPANIES ADDED. TO SOME OF THESE NEW. YOU KNOW IT EITHER GENE THERAPY OR A MINHA THERAPY -- WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES OF DIAGNOSES ARE A LOT OF TIMES WITH RARE DISEASE SOMETIMES IT COULD TAKE IN UP TO EIGHT YEARS BEFORE PEOPLE FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE PHYSICIAN IS NOT. NO MAY NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE OR YOU KNOW PATIENTS AND MEDICARE ALL YOU KNOW THERE IN THE CLINIC ARE HOW DID THEY GET TO SOMEONE WHO CAN FINALLY DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE -- YOU KNOW MOVED ALL TALKED ABOUT IN DOING THAT EARLY SCREENING. WHEN A BABY IS BORN WHICH IS GREAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS AVAILABLE AND I DON'T KNOW IF EVERY? NEWBORN HAS AN OPPORTUNITY AND YOU KNOW HOW HOW MANY OF THESE GENES CAN WE GET THAT EARLY DIAGNOSIS FOR AN EARLY SCREENING. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT USE YOU KNOW FAR AS A GOAL. I THINK IF YOU BRING UP A AND AND AND AND A VERY IMPORTANT -- CONSIDERATION AND AT IT AS A PEDIATRIC ORGAN TRANSPLANT SURGEON. UP THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATED -- THAT ABILITY TO PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND AND IN THESE BABIES EVEN BEFORE THEY'RE BORN. BUT IN SOME CASES AS YOU SAY IT'S NOT RECOGNIZE TO LATER AND THEN THERE IS ED THAN THAN THAT WORK UP OCCURS. I THINK THAT THERE IS -- AND GREG ENDS WHOSE AT STANFORD IS A IS A AS A GENETICIST AND THE METABOLIC EXPERT WAS ONE OF THEM THE KEY PLAYERS IN TERMS OF HELPING BRING FORWARD SOME OF THE THAT. THE SCREENING SOUTH IT WAS FOR FUN ARE MINE. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS AND ADVANCEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IS THIS. A IDEA OF THE REASON WE'RE ABLE TO DO GENE THERAPY IS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN GENOME -- BETTER NOW. WE UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN GENOME BETTER NOW BECAUSE IT WAS A DELIBERATE. INITIATIVE IN THE NINETIES. TO MAP THE HUMAN GENOME. THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE GENES. AND CELLS IN THE BODY IS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE DISCOVERY THAT LED TO THE NOBEL PRIZE THAT WAS. DON ON MOUSE EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS THAT THE FIRST TIME IT WAS NOTED THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY MANIPULATE THE GENES AND COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT EFFECT. THE MOST NOBEL PRIZE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OR SO. ALL EVERY EVERY SINGLE DISCOVERY ALL THESE ADVANCEMENTS ARE BUILDING ON EACH OTHER SO. IN TERMS OF GENETIC SCREENING IN TERMS OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON SARM FOR INSTANCE HAD FUNDED THAT OJ A GENOMICS PROGRAM TOGETHER. AND SPECIFIC INDEPTH LOOK AT JUST TO THEM VERY VERY VERY -- FINE DETAILS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE CELLS AND DISEASE STATES AS WELL AS AN AND HEALTHY STATE. WE CREATED AND AND I SEM INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL BANK WITH TWO THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND LINES THAT CAN BE USED. TO ELUCIDATE DISEASES SUCH AS AUTISM JUST REALLY REALLY -- INDEPTH ANALYSIS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS WITH BIG DATA AND AND MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING TO THERE'S STILL MORE TO DO. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS THAT IT'S NOT STEM SELLER SELF THERAPY IN ISOLATION. IT'S KNOWING THE BIOLOGY AND INTEGRATING IT WITH ALL THE OTHER ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE AND SO. FOR INSTANCE AND ONE OF THE CHILD I MENTIONED AND THAT AND THE CHILD AT THE CITY OF HOPE WITH GLIOBLASTOMA. NOT ONLY IS THIS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY OF AN ENGINEERED IMMUNE CELLS THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS THESE CANCER CELLS -- BEING DEVELOPED BUT AS THAT PARALLEL STUDIES IN COMPUTATION AT PREDICTIONS AND GENOMICS PROFILES OF WHAT THE CANCER'S GOING THROUGH SO IF SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN IF IT RECURS OR SOMETHING ELSE. NOW THERE'S MORE INFORMATION TO GUIDE -- IMPROVEMENTS TO THE TECHNOLOGY SO. KIND OF A LONG WINDED ANSWER BUT I THINK IT IT IT'S IT'S IT THAT SPEAK TO YOUR RIGHT COMES FROM A VERY BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. DEALING WITH MAKING SURE POLICY IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALLOWING US TO GET THAT MAKING SURE THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE SO CAN BE USEFUL MY REFUND FORTY MILLION TO THAT. GENOMICS INSTITUTE WHICH IS. STANFORD WHICH IS THAT IT GROWS AND LISTENING SAN DIEGO. WHILE SOLICITS INSULT INSTITUTE THE EARLIER YOU CAN DIAGNOSIS THAT EARLIER IN THE BETTER YOU KNOW THE YOUNGER THE PATIENTS THEM THE BETTER. YOU ABSOLUTELY OUTCOME -- DISMAY AND JUST REALLY BRIEFLY MY LAST QUESTION WITH AS FAR AS BARRIERS I MEAN WILL. YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS BARRIERS TO GETTING. THE INNOVATIONS TO THE BEDSIDE COST. ACCESS HOME YOU KNOW INVESTMENT. MONEY YOU KNOW OPEN WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS ARE SEEING YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE HELP THOSE OF STATE LEGISLATURE. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT OF THOSE THINGS NOW THAT. WE HAVE INNOVATIONS WERE CONTINUING TO GROW AND LEARN. IN HOW CAN WE GET THAT TO THE PATIENT. AND I KNOW ACCESS TO THE BIGGEST TO YEAH I KNOW IT'S A NO BECAUSE NO I I I THINK IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT QUESTION BECAUSE THAT IS OUR NEW CHALLENGE IN ADDITION TO THE SCIENTIFIC. FRONTIER AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE POLICY AND AND ACCESS ISSUES THAT ARE GONNA BE. AT IT AND I CAN'T GO HAND IN HAND WITH ALL OF THIS IN FACT WE ARE ENABLING OUR INVESTIGATORS WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE CLINICAL TRIALS NOW. TO START GETTING ACCESS TO HELP TOOLS SORTS ARE DEVELOPING THEIR TECHNOLOGIES THERE THEY ARE BETTER AWARE OF ALL THE THINGS WEATHER'S REGARDING THEIR MANUFACTURING WHAT THE REGARDING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET OUT THERE TO THE PATIENTS. ALL THOSE FINE DETAILS SO THAT THEY DESIGN DESIGN THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS COULD THAT I CAN ACTUALLY WILL REACH THE PATIENTS IN THE AND IT DOESN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR YOU CAN GET A TO THE PATIENTS. HOW DO YOU -- I MEAN BECAUSE THE PROBLEM OF LUCK I SUPPOSE SIT ON HEALTH COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS COMES UP TO HOW TO PROVIDERS EVEN KNOW THAT THESE TREATMENTS EXIST HOW WITH THE EDUCATED. YOU KNOW IN CONTINUING EDUCATION BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE TRY TO ADD SOMETHING TO CONTINUING EDUCATION THE MEDICAL BOARD AS AN ISSUE WITH. YOU KNOW DOING IT AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A MOM WHO DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH IN AN INNER CITY. YOU KNOW HOW IT IN A MEDICAL CLINIC HOW ARE THEY EVER GOING TO KNOW THAT THIS EXISTS FOR THEIR CHILD THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION THAT. THAT YOU SHARE UP IT NUMBER ONE THE INITIATIVE. CALLS THAT IF ANYONE NEEDS A TREATMENT THAT IS DEVELOPED BY PUBLIC FUNDS. AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO IT IF THEY'RE LIVING CALIFORNIA AND RESIDENT CALIFORNIA. SECONDLY MY OTHER HAT IS AYE SIR PRO BONO IS ONE OF FIVE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF COVER CALIFORNIA WHICH OVERSEES THE A CA IN THE STATE. SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN CONVERSATIONS IN SEPTEMBER WITH OUR GUYS ON THE COVER CALIFORNIA SIDE WHO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTY PAYERS TO LET THEM KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WHAT TREATMENTS MAY BE COMING DOWN THE ROAD. AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT MANY OF THESE TREATMENTS MAY BE EXPENSIVE BUT FIRST. BUT IN THE LONG RUN THEY'RE GONNA END UP SAVING MONEY AS PROVIDERS COULD YOU NOT COULD BE SPENDING FORTY BILLION FOR EXAMPLE FOR DIABETES OR OR ANOTHER DISEASE. AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO BEGIN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. BECAUSE ONE SEES CLINICAL TRIALS ARE DONE ONE SEES TREATMENTS ARE APPROVED THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE READY TO GO OUT INTO THE INTO THE FORCE OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE ARE AWARE. OF WHAT TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE NUMBER ONE AND ACCESSIBILITY WHICH IS THAT AS YOU START STATE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. SMASHED GLORIA PICKING AS CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU THE PANEL SENATOR GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE THANK. MISS VAUGHN THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND MISTER PREEMPTED OF TESTS SPROUTS A CRACKLING YEAH I'M THANK YOU FOR YOUR STORY AYE ISM. YEAH I I'M NOT A HEALTH EXPERT I'M A SCIENTIST IN A BLUEBOOK GUY NOT SCANTRON GUY -- AND SO -- YOU'RE THE PERSONAL STORY IS JUST SO VALUABLE SO I KNOW WHATEVER TIME YOU TAKE WITH MORE CLEAR ACTUAL LIFE FOR JUST LOOKING AT YOUR YOU BOY. OF ITS CASE STREAMING HELPFUL FOR SOME OF US OF THIS ON A PROBE HASN'T YOU KNOW HAS. SOME WEIGHT OR SOME ABILITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE STAFF OF FREE TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL TYPE OF THE PERSONAL IS POLITICAL AS WITH BATES OFTEN LIKE TO SAY AND SO THIS THIS STOCK IS ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY HELPFUL BUT YOUR STORY IS IS INVALUABLE TO MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS MEANS FOR PEOPLE SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME SHUT THINKING HERE IN ARIZONA. ON THIS BEFORE ACTUALLY SUPER HELPFUL WELL I WOULD JUST SAY I WISH WE COULD LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE THE EIGHT I KNEW IN THE LEGISLATURE BAG AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON JUST LOOK AT CRISSY LOOK AT THIS -- BECAUSE I'M NOT A PART HEALTH LET ME ASK WILL BE ABOUT THE FINANCIALS AND I TOOK NO -- MS MONT OF YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THAT RETURN ON INVESTMENT YOU START TO SEE A ROYALTY PAYMENT WAS THAT THE WAY YOU PHRASED IT SO WE HAVE THE FIRST ROYALTY CHECK TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WAS THIS YOU KNOW IT WAS US THIS INITIAL SMALL AMOUNT ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND FROM FOUGHT BUT IT JUST. WHAT IT THE SIGNIFICANCE IS THAT IT'S THE MODEL THAT WORKS RIGHT THERE'S NO OTHER FUNDING AGENCY THAT HAS THAT BUILT THEN WHAT THERE'S A REPORT THAT WHERE THERE'S A RETURN ON THAT ON THE AWARD -- THERE ARE MORE PAYMENTS REGARDING THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT BUT ALL ARE PROJECTS -- HAVE ROYALTY -- PROVISIONS ATTACHED TO THE GRANT OKAY AND IF THEY GET AND THEN THERE IS A LOAN CONVERSION OPTION FOR THAT AND WHICH CASE THERE IS A LOAN WITH INTEREST THE GETS PAID BACK. AND THEN THAT THAT COMES BACK INTO. HE ALSO STATED BANG YOU MISSED MY INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY I'M SURE WELCH HAS WHAT YOU THINK MY OFFICE SO. WASN'T I MISSED IT DIDN'T GET IN REAL LIFE. THE OTHER IMPACT WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THIS AGENCY HAS CREATED FORTY TWO HUNDRED JOBS. IN CALIFORNIA AND TWO HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION TO THE STATE. A GENERAL FUND IT TAX REVENUE AND ANOTHER FORTY TWO POINT EIGHTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH I KNOW THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN GET HIM. AND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION. TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THE AGENCY AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY IS GENERATING REVENUE AND CREATING JOBS. BY LEVERAGING THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION IN GRANTS THAT WE'VE ISSUED ALREADY. WITH ALMOST ONE POINT SIX BILLION AND PRIVATE DONATIONS THAT WE'VE LEVERAGED AS AS WE HAVE STOOD POINT SEVEN TO POINT TWO POINT SEVEN RIGHT. THAT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT. SO YOU GOT YOUR FIRST ROYALTY CHECK YES NOW IS THAT. AND WHAT WHAT IS WHAT OF ROYALTIES ARE. WHAT ROLE THEY PLAY IN THE FINANCIAL? FUTURE OF THIS ORGANIZATION OF THIS OF THIS A ADDITION. I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT WE WON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR ROLE IN THIS PARTICULAR. YEAH FROM THE PROP SEVENTY ONE IN THE CURRENT AGENCY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT PURPOSE NAM. SO. I THINK THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE UP OF THIS ON A SESSION IT WAS MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE AS A FINITE. FUNDING BASED ON THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR ALLEN AND WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF OUR SUCCESS AND FUNDING THESE. CLINICAL TRIALS WE EXPECT THAT OUR RESEARCH FUNDING BUDGET WILL BE EXPENDED BY TO THE OTHER -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE STILL HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS THAT CAN MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN CONTINUE BEYOND THAT REGARDLESS OF YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS BEYOND THAT -- FOR THE PERIOD FOR THE DURATION OF THE WARRANTS ARE CLINICAL WHAT'S ABOUT FOUR YEARS -- SO THE ROYALTY PER. GOES BACK TO THE STATE IT DOESN'T COME BACK DECIRME -- THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES WHERE. SOME FUNDS COME BACK TO STORM HIDING GO INTO DETAIL BUT PART OF OUR KIND OF OUR PROCESS WHICH HAS BEEN -- OF REALLY EFFICIENT WAY OF MAKING SURE THE MONEY GOES TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO IS THAT WE HAVE MILESTONE BASED PAYMENTS. SO THAT WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP OUR GRANTEES ACHIEVE THE MILESTONES BECAUSE THAT MEANS THEY'RE DOING WELL IN THE PROJECT BUT IF FOR SOME REASON IT JUST CAN'T WORK OUT THE SOMETIMES THINGS DON'T WORK OUT. ITS BUILT IN THAT THAT MONEY COMES BACK IN TO THE RESEARCH FUND SO THAT IT CAN BE DEPLOYED TO OTHER PROGRAMS. OR EVEN TO THAT SAME PROGRAM SHOULD THAT FIX IT YOU KNOW GET WHATEVER'S -- THE HOLD UP FIX NOT COME BACK AGAIN WITH ANOTHER APPLICATION SO THAT'S YOU KNOW I JUST. IT KIND OF HOW WE BE CYCLE NOT RECYCLE BUT USE FUNDS MORE RESPONSIBLY BUT SO FROM READING THE REPORT CORRECTLY YOU HAVE THREE AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION LEFT. THAT YOU CAN ALLOCATE. THAT WAS THAT BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO PASSED AWAY TODAY. TODAY WE WERE PROBABLY ACCOUNTABLE OR EXACTS A PROXY BALLPARK ABOUT TO TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OVER TWO TWENTY OR SOUND. AND SO THEN WE I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OR MAYBE CLUMSILY GETTING TO ON THE WHICH IS -- RESILIENCE YOUR SYSTEM BILLET RIGHT OR ON GOING RIGHT THE WORK IS NOT DONE THEIR MORE YOU KNOW DISEASE'S SNEAKERS AND AND KIDS THAT NEED HELP RIGHT SO WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THAT LONG TERM FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE ORGANIZATION. TARA'S TO TAKE THAT. AS A STATE AGENCY WE CANNOT GET INVOLVED IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS BUT THAT DOESN'T PREVENT BOB KLEIN WHO WROTE THE INITIAL IT INITIATIVE. WHO FOUNDED AMERICANS FOR CURES AND THEY ARE PROCEEDING? OUGHT TO CONSIDER PUTTING ON THE BALLOT IN TWENTY TWENTY A NEW INITIATIVE -- AFTER THEY COLLECT THE SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY ISN'T THE ONLY OPTION. AT THIS POINT YES. I AM A BE INTERESTING CAN THAT CONVERSATION I GET HOW THAT'S PROBABLY OF EFFECTIVE AND GETS TO THE CAT SCALE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ARM AND I AT THE WEALTHY THAT IS ME ONLY GOVERNMENT AND HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT I ALL OF US LIKE ANYTHING -- HOWEVER I RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TO FUND INNOVATION OF THIS NINETY TWO WITH THE SCIENCE THE EXPENSES THAT COME WITH IT ALSO KNOW AND I APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE BOXES ON THIS REPORT THAT LAYS OUT FOR FOLKS LIKE US TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH. AND YOU KIND OF GOT THIS A MINUTE AGO SENATOR ABOUT THAT -- ABILITY -- TO SO I MEAN ALL THIS IS IN THERE BUT IT'S JUST THE STORY IS AND I KNOW IT'S ALL IT'S ILLUSTRATIVE OF MANY OTHERS ARMS WE WANT TO KEEP THAT GOING IN AND CONTINUED FRANKLY OUR BRAND OF BEING INNOVATORS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT -- SO ANYWAY. FANTASTIC STUFF PLEASE KEEP IT UP AND LET US KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO TO BE HELPFUL WITHIN THE LEGAL BY THE WHAT YOU COULD SAY INSIDE THIS BUILDING THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. THEY WAS GLORIA -- WHILE WE STILL HAVE YOU AT THE TABLE WE WE LEARNED HOW MUCH BOND FUNDING IS LAUGHS -- WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT TWENTY TWENTY BALLOT APPARENTLY PRIVATE EFFORT ANY SIZE OF BOND THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ARE YOU. IT IS MISTER KLEIN LOOKING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE BILLION IS LOOKING NEIGHBORHOOD. FIVE FIVE BILLION YES. AND HAVE OTHER STATES FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD IN THIS REGARD ME TALK ABOUT THE AND I AGE FUNDING THE FEDERAL PICTURE. OF OTHER STATES THAT CHASING A THIS INDUSTRY -- OR IS CALIFORNIA'S STILL VERY MUCH AN AL LIAR. MANY STATES HAVE ATTEMPTED -- AND THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE STILL IN EXISTENCE BUT THE BUDGETS ARE AND KNOW WHERE. YOU KNOW AND THAT'S THAT IS YOU KNOW THE MAJOR LIMITATION -- AND ANOTHER THING THAT HAS HELD UP SOME OF THESE EFFORTS ARE THERE IT OFTEN -- SHORT TERM ALLOCATIONS AND ONE OF THE AT THE ADVANTAGE IS THAT THE SERVER MODEL HAS ALLOWED US IS IT'S ALLOW US TO DEPLOY THE FUNDING WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THERE IS A SCIENCE BASED OPPORTUNITY. RATHER THAN HAVING AN ARTIFICIAL YOU KNOW KIND OF LIMITATION. THAT'S BUDGETARY OR TIME BASED AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALSO THE NIH RECOGNIZES A HUGE ADVANTAGE. NAM FOR INSTANCE THAT BILLET. EIGHT TO GET THE MILESTONE BASED PAYMENTS AT THEIR NOT MET BACK IN AND REDEPLOY IT. OFTEN AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY DO BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES BACK AND IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GO TO ANY YOU KNOW IN ANY PREDICTABLE WAY BACK TO THEIR PROGRAMS AND I'LL JUST GO BACK. INTO THE MORE GENERAL FUND SO -- THERE BEEN A MARYLAND IS STILL HAS A SMALL EFFORT THERE LIKE I THINK OF TWO OR THREE FTA EASE NEW JERSEY HAD ATTEMPTED I DON'T THINK IT WAS RE UP THIS YEAR NEW YORK -- I THINK THEY LOST THEIR FUNDING IT'S JUST HAD A REAL PROBLEM ACCESS TO ALL THE BOARD MEMBERS WERE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. BUT IT THAT THERE ARE ATTEMPTS BUT BUT THE AND SOME OF THEM ARE MAKING AT DELAWARE STARTING TO TIP. RAZOR VISIBILITY IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING -- BUT STORM IS KIND OF UNIQUE IF THE ONLY ONE IT'S ONLY ONE OUT THERE IN THE IN THE WORLD ACTUALLY. AND FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO ACCELERATE THE HEARING JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THE RESULT ARTICLE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE ABOUT ON REGULATED STEM CELLS CLINICS AN ISSUE THAT I'M SURE YOU. HAVE BEEN AWARE OF IT WAS NEW HOT TO ME WHEN I READ THAT ARTICLE I GUESS THESE STEM CELL UNREGULATED STEM CELL CLINICS ARE PROLIFERATING. GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY CONCERNS FROM -- YOU BOTH ABOUT. BUT REGULATED CLINICS IS A SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT THERE'S CERTAINLY A FEDERAL COMPONENT HERE RIGHT BUT DOING CALIFORNIA NEED TO BE I AM WELL LAST ACTING ON THIS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND AND S. B. FIVE TWELVE WHICH WAS SIGNED BY. GOVERNOR BROWN YET LAST YEAR THIS YEAR. RATHER LAST YEAR TOOK EFFECT JANUARY ONE BY SENATOR HERNANDEZ WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN SENATE -- HEALTH COMMITTEE. AND IT SAYS THAT TO EVERY HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER WHO IS NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA MUST NOW GIVE A NOTICE. TO ANY POTENTIAL PATIENT THAT THEY ARE NOT. REGULATED BY THE FDA NOR APPROVED AND REGULATIONS WILL PROVIDE IN FINES TO THAT ORGANIZATION AND A RECORD SHALL BEGIN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN FROM THEM BORDER MEDICAL QUALITY ASSURANCE OF THE REPORTS NOT READY YET. TO FIND OUT HOW MANY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED A AGAINST CERTAIN PRACTITIONERS THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE A STANDSTILL TERRORISTS. WHERE PEOPLE ADVERTISE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WHETHER IT'S THE CARIBBEAN WHETHER IT'S MEXICO WHETHER IT'S ASIA WE HAVE THE TREATMENT FOR YOU AND WE CAN HEAL YOU? THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR US BECAUSE YOU CAN'T RESTRICT A U. S. CITIZENS RIGHT TO TRAVEL THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE HEALED. AND SO ALL WE CAN DO IS WARN PEOPLE AHEAD OF TIME. THAT NO THERE THERE ISN'T A A CURE FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO FIND A CURE FOR THAT WE KNOW OF AND SOLD THEM THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY SOME OF THE STEM CELL. CLINICS AND AND TOURIST AMERICANS MAY NOT BE ACCURATE AND WOULD BE BASICALLY TAKING YOUR MONEY VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE EARLY CANCER DAYS IN MEXICO. WHERE YOU KNOW GOD NOTS FROM NECTARINES WORTH CONSIDER TO BE? CURES FOR CANCER WE KNOW THEY WEREN'T BUT YET A LOT OF PEOPLE BOUGHT INTO IT. MORE TO COME ON THAT ISSUE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU SIR FOR BEING HERE. THINK OKAY WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION TO OUR NEXT PANEL -- PARTNER PERSPECTIVE. DOCTOR JAY AND NO ALTERNATE THE DIRECTOR OF THE UC DAVIS OF STEM CELL PROGRAM. AND INSTITUTE. FOR REGENERATIVE SHEARERS. WE WOULD LIKE TO OUT WELCOME DOCTOR NOVA. TO THE PANEL. THEY BELIEVE WE HAVE A PLATE IS SO FEW SLIDES. ARE THEY STILL CALLED SLIDES AND NOT SURE YEAH AT THAT ABOUT HER THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SO -- HONORED TO BE HERE AND HAVE A CHANCE TO AT PRESENT TO YOU. I WANTED TO JUST SHOW YOU A FEW SLIDES ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO US HERE IN SACRAMENTO UM TO HAVE SERMON TO HAVE THIS FUNDING AND TO BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD LEADER IN STEM CELL RESEARCH [inaudible] SO REALLY. THE FIELD OF MEDICINE IS CHANGING WE FEEL IT EVERY DAY AT THE HOSPITAL -- GENE THERAPIES GENE EDITING IMMUNOTHERAPY GIVING CANCER PATIENTS IT A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE AND REALLY SPECIALIZED AND FACILITIES ARE NEEDED FOR THESE LIVING MEDICINES IS NOT JUST PILLS IN A BOTTLER. OF VIOLENCE YOU KNOW ED VACCINE IT'S LIVING MEDICINES AND SO YOU NEED THESE REALLY. VERY SPECIALIZED FACILITIES IN TEAMS AND TO DO THAT AND THANKS TO SERVE HIM. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THAT HERE IN SACRAMENTO MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN AROUND THE STATE'S ABLE TO BUILD AND SUCH TEAMS AND TO DELIVER IT. TO BEGIN TO DELIVER THESE AT A LIVING MEDICINE SO WE'VE A VERY. HONORED TO HAVE THE TEAM TRAINING THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- AND EVERYTHING FROM RESEARCH THROUGH THE CLINICAL TRIALS FUNDED BY SIR. SO THIS IS WHAT OUR PROGRAM LOOK LIKE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE A I CAME BACK HOME HERE TO SACRAMENTO FRED AFTER SADDAM HAD SHASTA AND WAS IT A WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. AND WAS CURSED TO COME BACK AND NOW AND I JUST OVER A DECADE LATER HERE'S OUR PROGRAM. SO WE HAVE -- ARE INTER INTER UC DAVIS AND THEN ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AROUND THE STATE AND BEYOND AND OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS AND THANKS THANKS TO CERTAIN FOR THAT. OUR BUILDING STARTED OUT AS AN ALL PART OF THE STATE FAIR. THE HISTORIC BUILDING THE WHEN I FIRST CAME BACK IT LOOKED LIKE THIS IN THE OLD WAREHOUSES AND NOW IT'S HIGH TECH. MANUFACTURING FOR STEM CELL THERAPIES TO SEND TO THE FACE SINCE. THE IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW ABOUT CERTAIN IS THAT THEY FUND EVERYTHING THROUGH THE BASIC RESEARCH THE DISCOVERY OF THESE NOVEL TRIALS. THROUGH THE PRE CLINICAL RESEARCH INTO THE CLINICAL TRIALS. NIH REALLY DOESN'T FUND THIS PART IT'S KIND OF BORING TO THEM. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH YOU HAVE WDM. HYPOTHESIS BASED GRANT AND THEN YOU CAN GET THESE EARLY PHASES AND THEN THEY WILL FUND SOME -- CLINICAL TRIALS BUT THIS THE OFTEN CALLED THE VALLEY OF DEATH IT'S LARGELY LOST WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDING AND STERN HAS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THESE REALLY PROMISING THERAPIES THROUGH FROM. BASIC RESEARCH ALL THE WAY TO NEED THEM AS YOU WITH THAT BABY RONNIE EARLIER. WANTED TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE TO MAKE THESE INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS SO THIS IS BASIC RESEARCH. AT ITS FINEST YOU START WITH A LITTLE PINCHING SKIN FIBROBLASTS FROM THE PATIENT. WE ADD FACTORS MAKE THEM INTO THESE INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS THAT FOR ALL OF THEM. INTENTS AND PURPOSES REALLY ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS CAN THEN DO CHARACTERIZATION SEQUENCING -- DIFFERENTIATE THEM SAY INTO NEURONS STUDY DISEASE IN A DISH FROM THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT YOU HAVE THE GENETICS FROM THAT INDIVIDUAL PATIENT. AND THEN WE CAN USE SOMETHING CALLED CRISPER TO ADD JEAN EDIT INCORRECT HUMAN NEURONS TRANSPLANT THEM VERSES AT CONTROLS AND AVATAR MICE THEY I WATCH WHAT THEY DO IN THE BRAIN. THESE NEURONS FROM THE AND IS PROPONENTS DON'T STEM CELLS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER -- THEY SIGNAL IF THEY HAVE A DEFECT SUCH AS FROM A AT A CHILD WITH A NEURO DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WEEKEND TESTED DIFFERENT DRUGS IN THE DISH AND SEE HOW WE CAN CORRECT THOSE AS SIGNALING DEFICITS -- WE HAD THE FIRST -- GROUP THAT MADE VASCULARIZED BRAIN ORGAN NO AIDS AND SO THE HUMAN NEURONS CAN SELF ASSEMBLE INTO THESE MANY BRAINS IN ADDITION WHICH IS VERY COOL. WE USE THAT. TO STUDY DIFFERENT UNDER A DEGENERATIVE DISEASES SUCH AS HUNTINGTON'S AND WROTE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS AS WELL. WE'RE VERY LUCKY HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO HAVE A GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE FACILITY THIS WHERE WE ACTUALLY DO THE CELL AND JEAN MANUFACTURING FOR THE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT HOW THE U. S. FDA APPROVALS. THIS IS. IN CONTRAST TO THOSE FOR PROFIT CLINICS THEY DON'T HAVE FTA APPROVALS -- WE NEED THAT HAVE TO DO THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGER. LARGEST ACADEMIC GMP FACILITIES IN THE USA WE HAVE SIX INDIVIDUAL SWEETS. WE WORK WITH MANY ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS -- ACADEMIC THROUGH -- GRANTS THAT WE HAVE TOGETHER THROUGH SERUM AND INDUSTRY IS A FEE FOR SERVICE SWISS IS GOOD IN AKRON AMHERST DATA IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT THEY'RE CALLED GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE AS OPPOSED TO BAD MANUFACTURE. ACT. AND ARE ARE A DIRECTOR OF PROFESSOR GERHARD CAN GIVE YOU A WHOLE LECTURE ON WHY THE BAD PRACTICES LED TO THE THESE A GMP IF IF IF IT IS. I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO THAT IN INTEREST INTO. SO THIS OUR PROGRAM RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR A STENCIL REGENERATE MEDICINE TRIALS ON GOING OVER TWENTY IN THE PIPELINE. THOSE WITH THE GREEN ARROW HAVE FDA APPROVED CLINICAL TRIAL. AND THE RED ARROWS ARE THOSE THAT WERE WAITING TO START -- SPEAKING TO THE FDA AT SOME AT SOME LEVEL PRE PRE AYE INDEED INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION OR FURTHER. WE WERE LUCKY I I SAID THAT CERTAIN FUNDS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PIPELINE CITIES OF THE BASIC RESEARCH TRANSLATIONAL IS IN THE AT MEISSEN ANIMAL MODELS. AND THEY FUND ALSO THESE CLINICAL TRIALS WHICH ARE SO SO IMPORTANT SO WE WERE. VERY FORTUNATE TO RECENTLY JOINED THE ALPHA CLINIC NETWORK THESE ARE PROVIDING RELIABLE CLINICAL TRIALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALSO AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT THE PUBLIC WE GET CALLS EVERY SINGLE DAY FROM PEOPLE WONDERING ABOUT TRIALS WONDERING WHERE YOU CAN THEY GO FOR SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TRIALS. AND OUR TEAM WILL GUIDE THEM TO THE PROPER CLINICAL TRIAL THROUGH THE CERTAIN NETWORKS LIST. AND SO VERY -- GLAD TO BE ABLE -- TO GET THAT HERE IS THE GROUP OF THE TOP TIER OF MEDICAL CENTERS WHERE THE WHERE THE ALPHA CLINICS ARE. AND REALLY SPECIALIZING IN THIS OF THESE TYPES OF STEM CELL THERAPIES THE FIRST ONE WAS -- THE HOPE TRIAL THAT WE DID IT IN OUR ALPHA CLINIC WHEN IT OPENED IN THEM SACRAMENTO. THE HOPE TRIAL FOR OF BOYS THEY ADDITION MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND WE'VE NOW -- TREATED SEVERAL OF THOSE PATIENTS AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS ON GOING IN OUR CENTER AND THE HEALTH CLINICS ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS AN OUTPATIENT CLINIC TO COME IN. AND ACTUALLY GET YOUR STEM CELERY GENERAL MEDICINE. AND SO IT'S IT'S REALLY THAT THE NEXT WAVE OF THERAPY. IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A AT THIRTY THREE COUNTY CATCHMENT REGION AND SO THESE PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO COME A INTO A CLINIC CAN BE TREATED IF. THE TRIAL WAS APPROVED SO FINALLY THIS IS REALLY A NEW ERA OF LIVING MEDICINE -- SELLING GENE THERAPIES FOR DISEASES AND INJURIES THAT REALLY DON'T HAVE GOOD. HERE IS NOW AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO TRAINING THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OF THE FUTURE WORKING WITH -- THE IT STUDENTS OF AT ALL LEVELS WHO ARE LEARNING THESE TECHNIQUES AND SYSTEM REALLY THRILLED TO BE BACK AT UC DAVIS BACK HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND THAT'S WHEN I WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT THAT. YOU WERE MENTIONING THAT YOU WERE DRAWN BACK TO YOU CALIFORNIA BE BECOME LARGELY BECAUSE OF PROP. SEVENTY ONE HA HOW UNIQUE IS YOUR STORY OR DO YOU SEE A WHOLE SERVE TALENT BASE. THAT HAS BEEN DRAWN HERE OR IS GROWING UP HERE. ARE A ORGANICALLY -- I MEAN HOW HOW HOW UNIQUE IS YOUR STORY. MY STORY IS NOT THAT UNIQUE -- WE IS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A A BIG BRAIN DRAIN FOR REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE IN THIS FIELD AND IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA DO STEM CELLS THAT THIS THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD COME. SO REALLY -- AT A HUGE DRAW IT THANKS TO SIR. SO AND THEN THE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE VALLEY OF DEATH AND HOW CRUCIAL THAT BOND FUNDING HAS BEEN IN THAT PARTICULAR A PIECE OF THE PROCESS DO YOU. I ANTICIPATE GOING FORWARD IF IF. FUNDING SOURCE WERE TO BE FOUND RAP -- RENEWED IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO FILL THAT NEED OR IS THE PROCESS KIND OF MOVING SO QUICKLY THAT OF BEYOND THAT THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE NEED GOING FORWARD OR IS THAT DO YOU SEE THIS BOND FUNDING CONTINUING TO SERVE A PURPOSE I GUESS THAT SERVICE HUGE PURPOSE -- IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM. GOING IN TO KEEP THE THE FUNDED NETWORK OF CLINICAL TRIALS GOING AND THE PIPELINE LEADING INTO THOSE CLINICAL TRIALS I THINK -- THE WORLD IS LOOKING TO US TO DEVELOP THESE THERAPIES. AND ESPECIALLY FOR CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE THIS TERM AS SCIENTIST AT A CERTAIN TO GET THEM IF CERTAIN ENDS. THE SO. WE WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO COMPETING FOR THE YOU KNOW THE NIH FUNDING AND ONLY IN A 528% OF THE GRANTS THAT YOU PUT AN END TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH WILL GET FUNDED. AND REALLY. THINGS LIKE SCALING UP FROM A FEW FLASKS TO IF YOU LEADERS OF PRODUCT THAT'S NOT OF INTEREST TO THE TO THE STUDY SECTIONS THAT REVIEW THE GRANTS FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH PLAN. CERTAIN HAS BEEN FUNDING THINGS LIKE THAT -- TECH TRANSFER OF THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY AND REALLY HUGE FOR SOONER BECAUSE I GET DANIEL IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET GRANTS TO FUND LIKE IT CLICK OF PHASE ONE MAYBE FACE TO CLINICAL TRIAL BUT TO GO. FORWARD INTERFACE THREE AND THEN TO GET IT ULTIMATELY APPROVED FOR REIMBURSEMENT BY INSURANCE THAT TAKES INDUSTRY PARTNERS AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE IT'S HAPPENING IS HEARING CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU DOCTRINAL TO JUST WANNA SEE OF MY COLLEGE WHO WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC LEVINE FROM. MARIN COUNTY -- TO SOLICIT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR DOCTOR KNOWLTON SEEING NINE HEARING NONE. THANKS VERY MUCH DOCTOR MONEY SHE HAD A VERY MUCH SO MOVING TO OUR FINAL [inaudible] PRESENTER. WE'LL BE HEARING FROM DAVE JOHNSON WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STEM CELL REPORT WHICH IS THE ONLY NON GOVERNMENTAL WEBSITE DEVOTED SOLELY. TO CALIFORNIA STEM CELL AGENCY. MISTER JOHNSON HAS FILED THE AGENCY SINCE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND FIVE AS PUBLISHED MORE THAN FORTY SIX HUNDRED ITEMS IN THE STEM CELL REPORT. THE SITE PROVIDES NEWS AND COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC POLICY BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ISSUES. CONCERNING SIR ARM AND JOHNSON WE WELCOME YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE. AND ON THE AND HEAR YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS I THINK THE AGENCY IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION HERE IS -- DOCTRINAL TO MENTIONED ABOVE TO YOU HOPE LUCKY UC DAVIS WAS. IN FACT THE LOCK IS AND FAR FROM. THE SPENT THE OF THE HEAD PEOPLE AT THE BOARD MEETINGS AT THE ALL INVOLVED IN THE SERMON ON A AGENCY. REGULATE AND THEY WATCHED WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE GOING WHAT WAS POSSIBLE AND THEY WENT OUT AND GOT IT. BUT IT UC DAVIS IS A GOOD OF SOME OF THE INTENTIONS BEHIND. THE HOME OF PROPOSITION SEVENTY ONE IS TO BUILD UP THE STENCIL COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA -- PUT UP I WAS IN MAZATLAN MEXICO THE FALL TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE PROPOSITION SEVENTY ONE BEING PASSED. I READ A HEN A HEADLINE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT SAID. THERE WAS A NEW GOLD RUSH COMING TO CALIFORNIA. AND WAS ONE INVOLVING STEM CELLS INSTEAD OF NUGGETS. HOLY ARGONAUTS I SAID TO MYSELF USING THE TERM OF COURSE IT REFERS TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RUSHED THE CALIFORNIA GOLDFIELDS IN. EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE I WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. WITH HIS NEW STEM CELL GOLD RUSH. TODAY NEARLY FOURTEEN YEARS LATER. I STILL WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. AS HE AGENCIES FORMERLY KNOWN. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT CERTAIN FACTS ARE CLEAR. THE AGENCY IS UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND AMONG STATES THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THERE'S A FOR STATE AGENCY TO FUND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALL OF IT PARK. AND ONE POINTED IT ITS HISTORY IS SAFE TO SAY AS OTHERS HAVE REMARKED THAT THE AGENCY IS IS WHAT WAS. THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF FUNDING IN THE WORLD FOR HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH. THE AGENCY ALSO OPERATES WITH FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AUTONOMY THAT IS RARE IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. COURTESY OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE. BUT THAT MEASURE ALSO PROVED TO BE BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE. THE AGENCY'S FINANCIAL AUTONOMY IS ALLOWED TO PROVIDE A REASONABLY STEADY STREAM OF CASH OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. SOMETHING IS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN THE LONG TERM RESEARCH. BUT IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIDELY AVAILABLE TREATMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME. THE BALLOT MAJOR CARRIED THE AGENCIES THAT. FOR NO MORE MONEY AFTER THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS GONE. CASH FOR NEW AWARDS AS HASN'T HARASSMENT PREVENTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO RUN OUT. AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR ALL THE AGENCY COULD SLOW DOWN THE PACE OF ITS AWARDS AND STRETCH AND A LITTLE BIT LONGER. THERE IS AN EFFORT UNDER WAY NOW TO PRIVATELY RAISE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN. OF THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY OVER IT'S LIFE THE AGENCY HAS HAVE A NATIONAL AND SOMEWHAT MORE MODESTLY GLOBAL IMPACT. BOTH AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING. AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION BUT ALSO IN STAYING THE COURSE ON HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH ONE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS BACKING AWAY. BEYOND THAT THE STENCIL AGENCY IS THE ONLY STATE DEPARTMENT WHOSE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PRODUCE A MARKETABLE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. IN THIS CASE SECURE OR TREATMENT FOR AFFLICTIONS NOW NEARLY UNTREATABLE -- FINALLY AND ALL BUT CERTAIN BUT CERTAIN IS THE ONLY STATE AGENCIES BUT TAKES BACK MONEY WHEN THE PROJECT WILL HEADS UP ON THE ROCKS. BY THE END OF LAST MONTH THAT FIGURE TOTALED IN RECENT YEARS MORE THAN THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO BIG CATEGORIES OF AWARDS. THAT SORT OF OF CASH RECOVERY IS NOT A PRACTICE OF OCCURS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. CONCERNED THE MONEY GOES BACK INTO THE POT. FOR MORE RESEARCH AIMED AT TREATING ALL THESE HORRIBLE AFFLICTIONS. HOWEVER THE AGENCY HAS HIT SOME SHOALS FROM TIME TO TIME. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE AGENCY'S GOVERNING BOARD COMMISSION OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR STUDY OF ITS EFFORTS BY THE PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE. TWO YEARS LATER THE IOM WHICH IS SORT OF PROVISION FOR INSTANT MEDICINE REPORTED DISCERNMENT HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT FLAWS. THE IOM STUDY SAID THAT THE AGENCY HAD ACHIEVED QUOTE MANY NOTABLE RESULTS. BUT IT ALSO RECOMMENDED SWEEPING CHANGES TO REMOVE CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROBLEMS CLEAN UP A TROUBLING DO EXECUTIVE ARRANGEMENT. AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE GOVERNING BOARD. THE REPORT SAID QUOTE FAR TOO MANY BOARD MEMBERS REPRESENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT RECEIVE SOME FUNDING OR BENEFIT FROM THAT FUND. THESE COMPETING PERSONAL OR PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS COMPROMISE A PERCEIVED INDEPENDENCE OF THE ICE YOU'LL SEE WHICH IS A CERTAIN GOVERNING BOARD. AND INTRODUCED POTENTIAL BIAS IN TWO BOARDS DECISION MAKING. AND THREATEN TO UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD. BECOME THE CONFLICT ISSUES ARE BUILT IN TO THE BALLOT PROPOSITION. BUT GARY POTENTIAL RECIPIENT INSTITUTION SEATS ON THE TWENTY NINE MEMBER BOARD. AND INDEED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE LAST TIME I CALCULATED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE BOARD. AND AWARDS ROUGHLY 90% OF THE GIVEN OUT PLACER HAS GONE TO INSTITUTION. WITH TIES TO MEMBERS OF THE BOARD. ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER THE OTHER WHEN PRESENTED ITS REPORT. THE SERVER BOARD APPROVED A NEW POLICY BUT CURRENTLY BARGE THIRTEEN OF ITS TWENTY NINE MEMBERS FROM VOTING ON ANY GRANTS WHATSOEVER. TO HELP DEAL WITH THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER STUDIES ABOUT THE AGENCIES OF PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TWO THOUSAND AND TEN LAW. YOU KNOW IN THAT THE IN THAT THOUGH ON NEW LAW THE LEGISLATURE MODIFIED THE INITIATIVE. WITH A SUPER DEGREE WHICH REQUIRES A SUPER MAJORITY VOTE TO REQUIRE TRIENNIAL PERFORMANCE AUDITS WOULD BE PAID FOR BY THE AGENCY ITSELF. THE REQUIREMENT OVER EXCLUDES SITE QUOTE SCIENTIFIC PERFORMANCE FROM THE AUDIT. THE FIRST AUDIT RESULTS CAME IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND CONTAINED TWENTY SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE MOST RECENT PERFORMANCE AUDITS CAME LAST SPRING. THE AUDIT FIRM MOSS ADAMS RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AREAS OF PRIVATE FUND RAISING RETENTION OF STAFF AND BETTER UTILIZATION OF BOARD MEMBERS. THE BOARD WAS TOLD THAT THE AGENCY HAD QUOTE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. AND THAT THE AUDITORS USUALLY SEAT LOTS OF GOOD THINGS. IN RECENT YEARS THE AGE OF HE HAS BEEN ON A SELF IMPROVEMENT REGIME THE EFFORT BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WAS DUBBED CERTAIN TWO POINT. OH BUT TERM WAS ORIGINALLY COINED BY WHO STEM CELL RESEARCHER HERE AT UC DAVIS. THE NEW DIRECTION AND EMPHASIS WAS DESCRIBED BY THE AGENCY AS RADICAL HUSSEIN DID IMPROVING SPEED EFFICIENCY OF ELEVATION. AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE LARGELY SUCCEEDED. AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IT TOOK ALMOST TWO YEARS FOR GOOD IDEA TO GO FROM APPLICATION TO THE FINAL FUNDING STATE. THE GOAL WAS TO SHORTEN THAT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS DELAYS IN FUNDING OR A PARTICULAR CONCERN TO BUSINESSES. AND OFTEN FOR CASUAL REASONS BUT THEY ALSO MEAN DELAYS AND ACTUALLY CAN THE HOPE OF A CURE OR TREATMENT. INTO THE MARKETPLACE. THIS WEEK WE AGENCY SAID THE CASH DELIVERY FIGURE NOW STANDS AT LESS THAN NINETY DAYS FOR CLINICAL AWARD. AND ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS FOR TRANSLATION TOWARDS. AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE AGENCY WAS PARTICIPATING IN ONLINE CLINICAL TRIALS. A LOT OF STAGE BEFORE TREATMENT IS CERTIFIED FOR WIDESPREAD USE TODAY THE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN. FORTY NINE IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ABOUT FIFTY PATIENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THOSE TRIALS TODAY THE FIGURES MORE THAN. EIGHT HUNDRED ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF SIR POINT CERN TWO POINT OH MARKED A DEPARTURE FROM WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED AN ACADEMIC PASS FAIL APPROACH. TO PUT FINAL EXAM FOR APPLICATION FROM INSTRUCTORS. INSTEAD. SERVICE ENGAGEMENT MORE PARTNER ORIENTED APPROACH THAT CAN BE FOUND IN SOME BUSINESSES. INSTEAD OF FLATLY FEELING THE APPLICATION IS NOT QUITE READY FOR PRIMETIME THE IDEA IS TO TO COACH THE APPLICANTS ALONG. TO HELP BRING THEM UP TO THE APPROVAL LEVEL TODAY THE AGENCY CAN COUNT THIRTY APPLICATIONS BUT ONE APPROVAL THROUGH THAT PROCESS. THAT'S WHAT IT'S RESEARCH BUT COULD HAVE SLIPPED AWAY. IN THE MORE DISTANT PAST. SAM IS NOW MUCH MORE ENGAGE WITH INDUSTRY THAN VARIANTS EARLIER YEARS WHEN IT DREW BETTER CHRISTIAN CRITICISM FROM SOME BUSINESS EXECUTIVES. ENGAGEMENT WITH BIOTECH FIRMS IS CRITICAL BRINGING TREATMENTS TO THE PUBLIC. TERMS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING AND SELLING PRODUCTS THAT IS A MATTER LEFT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. ONE REASON FOR CLOSER BUSINESS CONNECTIONS INVOLVES OF MATURATION OF THE WORK IN THE FIELD. WHICH IS BROUGHT RESEARCHER AND A CLOSER TO REALITY BUT IS ALSO BLEW UP TO DIFFERENT FOCUS WITHIN THE AGENCY AS TOP MANAGEMENT HAS CHANGED. ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT AREAS INVOLVING STEM CELL RESEARCH UNLIKELY TREATMENT PESAR COST. IT IS RARE TO HEAR RESEARCHERS ARE COMPANIES TALK ABOUT -- FORTHRIGHTLY IN PUBLIC ABOUT SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THE COST OF DRUGS AND TREATMENT OF OUR HIGH VISIBILITY MATTERS FOR YOU FOLKS HERE IN WASHINGTON AND FOR PATIENTS. ESTIMATES OF OVER YOU SOME OF THE ESTIMATES FOR STEM CELL TREATMENTS AND CURRENTLY RUN UP TO THE AT LEAST NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THE LEGISLATURE MOVED TO HELP ASSURE AFFORDABILITY BE REQUIRED BY RECORDING GRANTEES TO SUBMIT AFFORDABLE ACCESS PLANS WITH A COPY DOT BUT THE AGENCY COULD WAIVE THAT REQUIREMENT. HOW THAT WILL ULTIMATELY PLAYOFF ON AN ACTUAL PRODUCTS? WHEN WE COME INTO THE MARKETPLACE IS YET TO BE DETERMINED? THEY'RE ALSO SOME POLICY QUESTIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE STEM CELL PROGRAM IN THE NEW USE OF THE PALACE INITIATIVE. ONE IS ABOUT IS THE BALLOT INITIATIVE THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH SUCH AS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND CREATE NEW STATE PROGRAMS. DOES THE STATE HAVE HIGHER HEALTH PRIORITIES SUCH AS PRE NATAL CARE THAN SUPPLYING RESEARCHERS WITH CASH THAT COULD WELL SECURE FROM OTHER SOURCES. THIS GOES TO THE SCREENING QUESTION THAT GOES. ON ASSEMBLY WOMAN NOT WALDRON MATCH. SHOULD WE PAY FOR THAT INSTEAD OF SOMETHING FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD. IS BORROWING MONEY TO FINANCE RESEARCH THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT. THE INTERESTS AND EXPENSE RAISES% LIKE TOTAL COST OF A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR RESEARCH AWARD TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. SHOULD EXECUTIVES OF POTENTIAL RECIPIENT INSTITUTIONS SERVE ON THE BOARD TOWARDS THEIR EMPLOYERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. JUST A SHORT LIST BUT THESE ARE MATTERS THAT WILL COME UP AND REPEATEDLY ESPECIALLY AS A NEW INITIATIVE IS OFFERED. RETURNING TO THE EARLIER LIST OF CLEAR FACTS ABOUT CERTAIN ANOTHER FACT IS THAT LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED AS WE'VE SEEN SO DRAMATICALLY HERE THIS MORNING. AND INSERM REGULARLY -- OF HAS FORUMS FOR THESE SORTS OF APPEARANCES BUT YET THOSE ARE ALL CLINICAL TRIALS AND NOT. ACTUALLY THE TREATMENT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE. LITTLE DOUBT EXISTS THAT THE AGENCY HAS ADVANCED THE STEM CELL FIELD IN THIS BUILDING PORTS A CRITICAL MASS IN CALIFORNIA. THE BURGEONING RESEARCH PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS HAS HAD NOW HAS TAKEN IN THE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN CERTAIN FUND. IT VIRTUALLY DIDN'T EXIST IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR ANOTHER IS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ALFA CLINIC PROGRAM. JIM NOT ONLY INVOLVES THE UC DAVIS BUT UC SAN FRANCISCO YOU SEE IT ALL IN. UC IRVINE. AND THE CITY OF HOPE ON THE LOS ANGELES AREA ALL OF OUR PARTLY OPEN NETWORK. NONE THE LESS CERTAIN HAS NOT YET DEVELOPED AYE BUT HER BACK. STEM CELL TREATMENT BUT IS READY FOR WIDESPREAD USE. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE VOTER EXPECTATIONS AND AT THE END TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE AGENCY HAS SOMETHING OF A DEADLINE BECAUSE OF THEM NOVEMBER OF BECAUSE LITTLE. AND THE END OF THE FUNDING. AND THEIR BACKERS ARE HOPING FOR ANOTHER BALLOT INITIATIVE IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THAT WOULD OPEN ADDITIONAL FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE INTO THE PROGRAM. AND DEVELOPMENT OF A STEM CELL THERAPY THERE ARE THREE THOUGH IT COULD BE A COUPLE OF GREAT ADDRESS AND MANAGE SHOULDN'T BE AN ELECTION. THERE ARE THREE CLINICAL TRIALS AT THE SERMONS OF BACKING THE VERNE FACE. THREE AND THE OF SOME OF THOSE COULD BLOW OF A RESULT WITH A HEAT. THERAPY. BUT AS FOR NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE STENCIL GOLD RUSH OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT'S GOING TO MEASURE UP TO THE GOLD RUSH OF EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND THAT. REMAINS TO BE SEEN. WELL WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY AND AND YOUR EXPERTISE AND HAVING FOLLOWED THE SO CLOSELY FOR FOR MANY YEARS NOW SO YOU MENTION THE GOVERNMENT'S CHALLENGES -- THAT HAVE BEEN CITED IN THE PAST YOU RACIST SERIES OF QUESTIONS OFFER FOR ALL OF US TO CONSIDER SHOULD -- SHOULD A BOND AN ADDITIONAL BOND PASS AND ANOTHER FUNDING STREAM BE IDENTIFIED -- THAT'S SORT OF OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY THE IMMEDIATE -- CHALLENGE FOR CONTINUING -- MUCH OF THIS WORK. GOING FORWARD ASSUMING THAT WERE TO HAPPEN AND THAT'S A BIG ASSUMPTION BUT ASSUMING THAT WERE TO HAPPEN -- WHAT DO YOU FORESEE WOULD BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THAT HAVING A HIGHER. HAVING THESE INVESTMENTS COME TO FRUITION. OF FOR FOR PATIENTS AND ACTUALLY OF AFFECTING PEOPLE'S LIVES IN A POSITIVE WAY. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD IT WAS PRETTY MUCH OF YOU KNOWS BOTH THE BUSINESS AND AND THE SCIENCE QUESTION -- YOU GOT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME PUSH BACK OF COSTS ARE GOING TO BE AYE VIDEO AND THE ADMITTEDLY A LOSE COSTS ARE IT'S AN EARLY STAGE IN CAN BRING COST FOUND. IN THE ARE ALSO ONE TIME TREATMENTS ó YOU KNOW HEPATITIS C. CONTROVERSIES WHERE YOU HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF TREATMENT THAT IS SO. INSECURE OR HAS SOME ISSUES BECAUSE SO CLOSE. OF PROBLEMS WITH THE FOOD HE A PATIENT CENTERED. IT MINISTER THAT CAN GET RE INFECTED AND LOTS OF HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS [inaudible] NOT AFFECT. SO THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER IT WILL THAT BUT THE THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF THE REIMBURSEMENT SH. IT'S IN THE ETSY EUPHEMISM FOR HOW DO WE MAKE A PROFIT ON THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU MAKE A PROFIT THESE THINGS ARE GOING. TO BE DEVELOPED AND THERE IS WORK THAT SERVICE DOING CONCERNING REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES ARE TALKING TO INDUSTRY AND THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS. HELLO AND HOW THAT OF OTHERS SOLD DIDN'T GO OVER TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. SO THAT IT CAN BE REIMBURSED AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED IS IS A BIG QUESTION YET TO BE RESOLVED. A LOT OF THE STUFF THE GENE THERAPIES. STEM CELL THERAPIES ARE VERY VERY [inaudible] OF AND BUT IT'S IT'S THESE GOOD MANUFACTURING FACILITIES POWERFUL LIMITED CAPACITY THEY CAN'T TURN OUT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF TREATMENTS OF OF AND AND BRINGING THAT INTO A REAL MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS ANOTHER MATTER [inaudible] THAT QUIRK [inaudible] ARMED WITH SERVICE SOME EXTENT IF THIS IS GOING TO GO ON THE BALLOT. QUESTION THE IS. NOT ONE THAT WE WILL NECESSARILY ADDRESS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE THINK ABOUT IN A GENERAL CONTEXT YOU SAID YOU KNOW IS THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH THE ONE THAT WE WANT. TO S. SPEND OUR TIME ON A SHOULD WE INSTEAD BE LOOKING AT GENE THERAPY THROUGH CRISPER AND FINDING THAT. OR FINDING -- RESEARCH AND GLOBAL WARMING. WHICH IS THE ONE THING I THINK BESIDES NUCLEAR WAR THE COULD DESTROY CIVILIZATION. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PRIORITIES FURTHER. WHEN YOU HAVE A BOND COSTS GOING FOR YEARS THE COST OF THE FIRST BOND? WE WERE PAIN WHEN WE WERE CUTTING SCHOOLS CUTTING. ARE A TO Z. -- DISABLED IT CETERA. AND IF THERE'S A NEW FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BOND IT'LL BE MONEY COMING OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND PEOPLE. OFTEN DON'T PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. AND THINK REALIZE IT COMES OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET DOES. AND WILL WE HAVE OUR NEXT RECESSION WHICH WE PROBABLY WELL WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE. WITH PAIN FOR BOTH THOSE BONDS IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT I DON'T KNOW THAT. THROUGH THE ELECTORAL PROCESS YOU REALLY GOING TO GET THAT -- TRICKED THE THOUGHTS OF THE VOTERS TRADING OFF WELL SHOULD BE THIS SHOULD IT BE THAT. SHOULD BE RESEARCH INTO LA -- HOW TO PREVENT GLOBAL WAR MEAN IN DEVELOPING OF TECHNOLOGIES THERE BECAUSE I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE IS A VALLEY OF DEATH? FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO CREATE BIOFUELS [inaudible] AT CETERA SO IT REALLY IS A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES AND I HOPE THE VOTERS A LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU. AND THE QUESTIONS. SEEING HEARING NONE THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WE ARE UP ACTUALLY PASSED OUR THREE PM -- TIME -- I WANT TO SAVE LIMITS BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A LIMIT BECAUSE WE DO YOU WANT TO OFFER PUBLIC COMMENT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO COME FORWARD AND ADDRESS. THE SELECT COMMITTEE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY [inaudible] ANY TAKERS MAYBE NOT. SO SEEING NO ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS ALL OF OUR PANELISTS MY COLLEAGUES. FOR A SPENDING SOMETIME WITH US TODAY -- THIS WILL CONCLUDE THE SELECT COMMITTEE ABOUT TECHNOLOGIES HEARING ON THE SERMON AND MORE TO COME ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH WE ARE ADJOURNED
