A BROAD COALITION WE WERE VERY

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:21.205
CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL'S

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:23.274

BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AND THE

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.715
PRESS THAT COALITION I THINK

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:31.616
IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:32.917
THAT ARE A BIT RATHER

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.185
DEMONSTRATIVE FACT THAT THE

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:36.988
TEXT OF THE BILL. JEFF HAD HUGE

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:39.857
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES- I'D LIKE

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:41.025
TO THANK THE OFFICE OFFICE FOR

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.593
LINKING GATE AND PROP THAT AT

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.762
AS WE STATED PREVIOUSLY BUT WE

00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:45.697
BELIEVE THIS BILL STILL

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:47.799
CONTAINS ALL THE TECHNICAL

00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:52.904
ISSUES AND SO WE REMAIN.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.638
OPPOSED TO BE CLEAR. WE NOT

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.406
YEARS DOWN PAY THE TO COOK

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:55.940
NINETEEN WE'RE NOT OF. TO

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:57.342
PROVIDE NOTICE. TO EMPLOYEES

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:59.911
THE EVENT EXPOSURE IF THAT WAS

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:01.346
ALL THE BILL DID THEN DID WE DO

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:03.715
HAVE A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION-

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:05.383
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.451
THAT THE TEXTUAL ISSUES THAT

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:08.219
REMAIN IN THE- BILL TO THE DAY.

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:09.687
AND NEED TO BE FIXED SO THAT

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:12.657
IT'S WORKABLE- FIRST THE BILL

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:15.693
IS VAGUE STILL AT THE DESPITE

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.462
THE MULTIPLE ROUNDS EVENT. AT

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:19.831
UKHRUL MUST RECEIVE NOTICE AND

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:23.034
WHAT NOTED THEY MUST. YOUR

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:23.968
SEATS. AN EXAMPLE THE BILL I

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:27.739
PROVIDE FOR THREE SET OF DOC HE-

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:30.174
TO AVOID- I NOTICED THE CLOSURE

00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:32.877
A SET OF LABOR DOCUMENT AND

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:34.545
THEN ALSO THAT A CLEANING PAUL.

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.114
I THINK THIS IS AN ERROR BUT

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.215
PRESENT THE BILL ACTUALLY THE

00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:38.850
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS FOR WHO

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:40.418
GETS EACH OF THOSE DOCUMENTS.

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:41.219
AND SOME OF THE DIFFERENT

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:42.253
DEFINITIONS ARE COMPLETELY

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.188
UNDEFINED SO ONE OF THE THAT

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:46.124
THE DOCUMENT GOES TO ANYONE WHO

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.959
WAS EXPOSED. BUT THE BILL

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:50.461
DOESN'T DEFINE WHO WAS EXPOSED

00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:51.763
ANOTHER THAT GOES TO THE GROUP

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:53.030
ON THE WORK THAT AT THE TIME

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:54.599
WHICH MAKES SENSE. THE THIRD

00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:55.767
THAT WILL BE SENT OUT A

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.635
COMPANYWIDE WITHIN TWENTY

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:58.836
WITHIN ONE BUSINESS DAY

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:00.738
WHATEVER THAT MAY EXPOSURE I

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:01.539
GET I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:03.441
OFFICE INTENT. BUT I THINK THAT

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:05.743
WILL CLEAR TEXTUAL ERRORS THAT

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.744
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:11.682

I DIDN'T FLAG THE ISSUE THAT WE

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:22.460
BREAK THE LAW. A SECOND ISSUE

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:24.395
IS THAT THE BILL HAS A LONG

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:25.263

IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AND I

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.800
WASN'T ACTUALLY. REALLY SURE

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:43.767
THAT THIS WAS GOING DIRECTLY AT

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:45.336
FOSTER FARMS WHICH IS ONE OF

00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:48.005
THE BEST. AND LARGEST EMPLOYERS

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:49.640
M. IN MY DISTRICT ND IT'S

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:50.908
ACTUALLY VERY SAD THAT THIS

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:52.776
OUTBREAK HAS HAPPENED TO THEM.

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.645
BUT THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT HAS

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.847
DONE. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.782
THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO AND

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:01.151
HAS FAR EXCEEDED WHAT THE STATE

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:02.319
HAS MANDATED. SO I WOULD JUST

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:06.156
ARGUE. THAT THIS IS A FAILURE.

00:42:06.223 --> 00:42:09.994
OF MERCED COUNTY PAHO AND THEIR

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.929
INABILITY TO GET THE RESOURCES

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.998
THAT ARE BUSINESSES NEED TO DO

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:15.766
THE TESTING THAT IS REQUIRED

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:16.867
FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE THIS

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:18.335
LARGE AND I DON'T KNOW THE

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:19.904
EXACT NUMBER AND I WAS TRYING

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:20.771
TO GET THOSE NUMBERS BEFORE I

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:21.839
SPOKE WITH A JUST MOVED A

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.040
LITTLE BIT QUICKER ON HOW MANY

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:25.676
TESTS THAT THEY HAD DONE. PRIOR

00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:27.111
TO THIS OUTBREAK AND SO IT IS

00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:28.879
FRUSTRATING THERE'S A LITTLE

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:29.847
BIT IRRITATING BECAUSE I

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:31.148
UNDERSTAND THE NEED AND NONE OF

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.083
US WANT OUTBREAKS ESPECIALLY IN

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.718
LARGE BUSINESSES BECAUSE THESE

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.387
ARE GENERATIONAL JOBS WE HAVE

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:37.521
MULTIPLE GENERATIONS OF THE

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.089
SAME FAMILY WORKING AT THIS

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:40.724
PARTICULAR TIME FAMILY OWNED

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:41.558
BUSINESS AND THEY'RE

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:44.328
INCREDIBLY- WELL PAID AND IT'S

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:45.462
WHY THEY KEEP COMING BACK TO

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:48.399
WORK THERE AND SO IT IS VERY

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:48.933
VERY UNFORTUNATE BUT I AM

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:50.067
ACTUALLY. KIND OF FOLLOWING

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:52.703
THIS LAST FEW WEEKS AND HOUSES

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:56.206
DEVELOPED. WE ARE THE STATE AND

00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:58.208
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL EXPRESSLY

00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.043
WITH THE MANDATE SO WE'RE

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:01.011
PUTTING ON OUR BUSINESSES LAST

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:02.012
WEEK WE HAVE AN OUTBREAK IN THE

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.847
SENATE RIGHT BUT IT WAS A LIAR

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:06.050
OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES ARE

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:08.085
QUARANTINED IN THEIR APARTMENTS

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:09.820
RIGHT NOW I ROOM WITH ONE. I

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:10.921
TRY TO GET TESTED. AND I WAS

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:14.425
TOLD I DIDN'T HAVE TO. OKAY SO

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:16.393
THIS IS A HUGE FRUSTRATION THAT

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.928
WE HAVE BECAUSE THERE'S NO

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.064
CONSISTENCY AT THE STATE AND

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.865
LOCAL LEVELS WE HAVE NO. WE

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:23.467
JUST NO CONSISTENCY SO IT IS

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:24.668
INCREDIBLY FRESH AND WE HOLD

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:25.803
OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO A

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:27.972
STANDARD. BUT WE DON'T REALLY

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:31.041
TAKE IT TO HEART AND SO I WOULD

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:31.675
JUST WANT TO PUT OUT THERE THAT

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:34.912
I AM. I'M UPSET THAT THIS

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:36.213
HAPPENED TO ONE OF THE BEST

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.948
BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE. IN THE

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:39.550
CENTRAL VALLEY AND CERTAINLY.

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.051

WORKS BEFORE UNFORTUNATELY WHAT

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:50.828

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.500
YOUR DISTRICT BUT THIS IS WHAT

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:57.601
WE NOW THERE WERE STATE

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.203
REGULATORS THERE IN JUNE THEY

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:00.604
GAVE THEM- SPECIFIC

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:01.572
INSTRUCTIONS ON THINGS THAT

00:44:01.638 --> 00:44:02.406
COULDBE DONE THOSE WERE

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:05.442
IGNORED. EIGHT PEOPLE ARE DEAD

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:08.512
DEAD. BECAUSE OF THAT. I I'M

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:10.381
SORRY. IT'S NOT AN

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:12.349
INCONVENIENCE WHEN THE PEOPLE

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.784
WHO ARE DYING OUR FROM OUR

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.586
COMMUNITY TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.154
WHETHER IT'S A PROCESSING

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:18.756
FACILITY OR WHETHER IT'S A

00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:20.758
FAMILY FARM OR WHETHER IT'S A

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:22.626
LARGE INDUSTRIAL FARM WE ARE

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:24.595
LOSING OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:26.130
BECAUSE RULES ARE NOT FOLLOWED.

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:28.132
THEY WERE TOLD TO SHUT DOWN BY

00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:29.533
COUNTY HEALTH AND THEY DID NOT

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.502
DO SO FOR TWO DAYS BECAUSE THEY

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:32.936
NEEDED TO GET THE HARVEST OUT

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:34.338
WOULD HARVEST IS MORE IMPORTANT

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:35.939
THAN THE LIVES OF WORKERS THAT

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:37.975
WE DON'T SEE OR HEAR. SOMETHING

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.410
IS WRONG THIS WAS NOT ABOUT

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.778
FOSTER FARMS BUT THIS IS ABOUT

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.679
EVERY EMPLOYER WHO IS TAKING

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:43.680
THE RISK ON BEHALF OF THEIR

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.416
EMPLOYEES AS THEY KNOW THERE'S

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:47.284
A BREAKOUT. AND THEY REFUSED TO

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:48.519
TELL OTHER WORKERS THAT THERE'S

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:49.987
AN OUTBREAK IN THEIR FACILITY

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.622
BEING KNOW IT EXISTS THEY

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:52.956
REFUSE TO TELL THEM. THEY DO

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:54.024
NOT TELL THEM THE RIGHTS WERE

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.459
WORKING WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:56.493
EVEN REALIZE THEY HAVE THE

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.128
RIGHT TO STAY HOME. WHO ARE

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.396
BATTLING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:01.298
ACCESS ANY KIND OF HELP OUTSIDE

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:02.966
OF THE FACILITY BECAUSE MANY

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:05.069
TIMES UNDOCUMENTED. THAT IS THE

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:07.671
TRUTH IT IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:08.639
TRUTH BUT IT HAS

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:09.706
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.208
LATINO COCKETT THE LATINO

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:12.042

00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:14.812
PRIORITY BILL. AND I GET IT.

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.713
IT'S DISCOURAGING BECAUSE

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.981
TESTING SHOULD BE BETTER IN THE

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:20.150
STATE SHOULD HAVE. A BETTER

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:21.318
HANDED THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:22.453
THAT AS WELL BUT THE

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:25.923
pTO ONE TELL OTHER EMPLOYEES

00:45:25.989 --> 00:45:27.191
WHEN THERE'S AN OUTBREAK TO

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:28.592
TELL THEM OF THE RIGHT TO BE

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:29.460
ABLE TO STAY HOME IF THEY'RE

00:45:29.526 --> 00:45:30.694
SICK. TELL THEM OF THE RIGHTS

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.296
OF THE OF THE THEIR ABILITY TO

00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:20.077
TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY. AND IT

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:21.211
WILL NOT HURT YOU THANK YOU THE

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.813

MAKE SURE LIKE MY FRUSTRATION

00:46:27.184 --> 00:46:29.853

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.188
RIGHT BUT WE DON'T HOLD

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:33.157
OURSELVES. ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL.

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.591
LIKE WEEK WE THROW ALL THIS OUT

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:36.260
THERE WE THROW THE PLAN WE DO

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:37.895
ALL THESE THINGS. BUT WE ARE

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:38.595
NOT GIVING OUR BUSINESS TO BE

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.697
THE RESOURCES. TO DO THEIR JOBS

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.399

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:45.494
THE BILL DOES THE FILM THAT

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.163

TAKE A BREAK WHEN THEY WANT. OF

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:51.867
COURSE ANY MILLERITES BREAK

01:07:51.934 --> 01:08:01.143
