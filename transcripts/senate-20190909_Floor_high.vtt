COMING FROM THE COUNTY WHERE

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.442
WE'RE STILL KIND OF THE WILD

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:07.244
WEST OF POLITICS IN RIVERSIDE

STATUS QUO. THAT'S GONNA BE

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.242
VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE INCOME

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:39.610
AND ESPECIALLY A SUPERVISOR HAS

00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:46.150

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:56.427
HAVE A CHANCE BECAUSE THEY

00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:57.628
CLAIM THAT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

00:44:57.694 --> 00:44:59.930
RAISE ENOUGH MONEY BUT THROUGH

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:00.497
A STRONG GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:03.567
AND YES. SOME DONORS AND WANTED

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:05.102
TO SEE A HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:06.837
AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY I RECEIVED

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:08.205
SOME LARGER CONTRIBUTIONS

00:45:08.272 --> 00:45:10.374

INCOME AND SUPERVISOR HAD. I

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.211

GROUND WALKING TWENTY THOUSAND

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.049

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:21.351
AFFECT ON MY ABILITY TO PREVAIL

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:24.321
IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND SO. I

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.756
ALSO AGREE THAT THIS IS NOTHING

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:27.357
MORE THAN AN IN COMBAT

00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:30.094
PROTECTIVE MEASURE LET THE

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.395
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DECIDE FOR

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:33.630
THEMSELVES. WHAT THEY SHOULD DO

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:35.365
WITH REGARD TO ANY CAMPAIGN

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:36.633

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:46.777
HOW THEY HAVE TO RUN THEIR

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.145
MUNICIPALITIES IT'S VERY

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:50.414
OFFENSIVE AND FOR THOSE REASONS

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.149
I URGE A NO VOTE IN SB FIVE.

CERTAINLY REPARATIONS WE THINK

01:53:25.932 --> 01:53:28.434
ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS. ASSET

RACED WE TALK ABOUT THE ASSETS.

01:53:35.542 --> 01:53:37.076
DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE THAT'S

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:39.979
A CUMULATIVE THE FACT OF NOT

ONLY SLAVERY BUT OF COURSE OF

01:53:41.614 --> 01:53:43.683
JIM CROW IN OTHER A SEGREGATION

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:47.453
WHERE. AFTER AMERICANS WERE NOT

THAT THAT IS FAR THE

01:53:53.426 --> 01:53:54.794
FUNDAMENTAL INJUSTICE OF WHAT

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:56.930
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND SO I

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:58.097
THINK THIS RESOLUTION CERTAINLY

01:53:58.164 --> 01:54:00.733
IS A STEP FORWARD. A CERTAINLY

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:03.303
IS SOMEONE WHOSE OUT. OF THE

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:04.671

COUNTRY IS PART OF IT. THE

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:14.847
NATURE OF OUR COUNTRY GREW AND

01:54:14.914 --> 01:54:16.349
WE NEED TO FACE THAT AND THIS

01:54:16.416 --> 01:54:17.483

01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:31.464
I COME THROUGH IT IN A

01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:32.565
DIFFERENT LIGHT BECAUSE THE

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:35.468
FACT THAT. I SERVED. WITH THE

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:36.669

WE'RE STATION ORIGINALLY IN

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:39.472
FORT BRAGG NORTH CAROLINA. SO

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:40.807
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THIS GUY

01:54:40.873 --> 01:54:42.041
FROM CALIFORNIA WAS IN NORTH

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:44.544
CAROLINA BECAUSE THE AFRICAN

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:45.144

01:54:56.055 --> 01:54:59.525

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:03.896
AIRBORNE WITH THE BRAVES.

01:55:03.963 --> 01:55:07.333

01:55:14.974 --> 01:55:17.210
WITH THEM SIDE BY SIDE SO I AM

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:19.345
PROUD TO CALL THEM BROTHERS AND

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:21.281

AND- DISCUSS THE MERITS OF.

02:34:57.655 --> 02:35:00.724
MEDICINE AND DRUGS. LET ME JUST

02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:05.295
SAY A FEW THINGS. WHEN WE WERE

02:35:05.362 --> 02:35:06.263
CONSIDERING SB TWO SEVENTY

02:35:06.330 --> 02:35:10.467
SEVEN. IT WAS AT THE TIME I HAD

02:35:10.534 --> 02:35:14.972
MY FIRST GRAND CHILD. AND IT

02:35:15.039 --> 02:35:20.344
WAS DETERMINED. THAT. MY

02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:20.844
GRANDDAUGHTERS ONE YEAR

02:35:20.911 --> 02:35:24.548
BIRTHDAY. THAT SHE WAS AUTISTIC

02:35:24.615 --> 02:35:30.654
WE DIDN'T KNOW. TO WHAT EXTENT.

02:35:30.721 --> 02:35:34.291
IT HAPPENED. AT ABOUT THE SAME

02:35:34.358 --> 02:35:36.794
TIME THAT SHE RECEIVE THE MMR

02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:41.131
VACCINE. COINCIDENTALLY THE

02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:43.067
SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM CHAU AT

02:35:43.133 --> 02:35:44.768
APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME.

02:35:44.835 --> 02:35:48.739
AND I HAD A. A CHALLENGE WITH

02:35:48.806 --> 02:35:53.610
MY OWN CHILDREN. WHEN SB TWO

02:35:53.677 --> 02:35:54.712
SEVENTY SEVEN CAME ON AND I WAS

02:35:54.778 --> 02:35:57.014
A CO AUTHOR OF TWO SEVENTY

02:35:57.081 --> 02:35:57.581
SEVEN BECAUSE I'M NOT ONLY

02:35:57.648 --> 02:36:00.217
LEARNED ABOUT IMMUNIZATIONS

02:36:00.284 --> 02:36:00.818
I'VE TAUGHT ABOUT THEM AT THE

02:36:00.884 --> 02:36:04.822
UNIVERSITY LEVEL. BUT IT

02:36:04.888 --> 02:36:05.322
CREATED SOME SIGNIFICANT

02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:09.526
FRICTION. BETWEEN MY CHILDREN.

02:36:09.593 --> 02:36:13.697
AND MYSELF. AND LET ME SAY THIS

02:36:13.764 --> 02:36:17.000
THEY DON'T THEY CALL. MEDIC

02:36:17.067 --> 02:36:18.402
GIVING MEDICAL SERVICES A

02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:21.305
PRACTICE AND THE REASON WHY

02:36:21.371 --> 02:36:21.905
THEY CALL IT AT A PRACTICE IS

02:36:21.972 --> 02:36:24.074
BECAUSE IT'S NOT PERFECT. WE DO

02:36:24.141 --> 02:36:26.777
THE BEST THAT WE CAN. TO HEAL

02:36:26.844 --> 02:36:29.179
PEOPLE AND PREVENT THEM OF

02:36:29.246 --> 02:36:31.315
DISEASES THAT ARE MINOR AND

02:36:31.381 --> 02:36:33.317
DISEASES THAT ARE VERY SERIOUS.

02:36:33.383 --> 02:36:37.187
BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DO NOW. WE

02:36:37.254 --> 02:36:39.857
KNOW THAT A HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM.

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:43.627
IS NOT FULLY MATURE UNTIL A

02:36:43.694 --> 02:36:45.562
CHILD IS TWELVE TO FOURTEEN

02:36:45.629 --> 02:36:48.799
YEARS OLD AND WHILE I BELIEVE

02:36:48.866 --> 02:36:49.366
IN THIS IS ONLY ME SPEAKING

02:36:49.433 --> 02:36:51.235
WITH NO SCIENTIFIC BACK UP. AS

02:36:51.301 --> 02:36:55.506
I LOOK AND SEE THE INCIDENCE OF.

02:36:55.572 --> 02:36:56.039
AUTISM IN THE STATE IN THE

02:36:56.106 --> 02:37:01.111
COUNTRY. IS THAT. WITH THE

02:37:01.178 --> 02:37:01.712
IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULES THAT WE

02:37:01.779 --> 02:37:05.749
SEE. I THINK THAT THE SCHEDULE

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:06.483
THAT WE GIVE THESE

02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:08.919
IMMUNIZATIONS AND MAY BE TOO

02:37:08.986 --> 02:37:11.622
ONEROUS SERVE YOU WELL MAYBE

02:37:11.688 --> 02:37:12.923
TOO OVERWHELMING FOR A CHILD'S

02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:15.025
IMMUNE SYSTEM. THE BECAUSE

02:37:15.092 --> 02:37:17.161
WHAT'S CALLED AN AUTO IMMUNE

02:37:17.227 --> 02:37:19.863
REACTION NOW WHAT IS AN AUTO

02:37:19.930 --> 02:37:21.999
IMMUNE DISEASE MANY OF YOU HAVE

02:37:22.065 --> 02:37:24.334
HEARD OF THINGS LIKE LUPUS AND

02:37:24.401 --> 02:37:26.670
ALL SORT OF COLITIS AND GRAVES

02:37:26.737 --> 02:37:30.674
DISEASE FIBROMYALGIA.

02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:33.110
VASCULITIS RHEUMATOID FEVER.

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:34.711
WE'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT THE

02:37:34.778 --> 02:37:36.747
IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HOW IT WORKS

02:37:36.814 --> 02:37:37.915
AND A LOT OF THESE TV

02:37:37.981 --> 02:37:39.416
COMMERCIALS THAT YOU SEE ABOUT

02:37:39.483 --> 02:37:41.351
DRUGS THAT TREAT THINGS LIKE

02:37:41.418 --> 02:37:43.620
ALL SORT OF CORRUPT COLITIS AND

02:37:43.687 --> 02:37:45.556
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS OR DRUGS

02:37:45.622 --> 02:37:47.758
TO TRY TO TEMPER OUR OWN IMMUNE

02:37:47.825 --> 02:37:50.494
SYSTEM FROM ATTACKING. NORMAL

02:37:50.561 --> 02:37:52.963
CELLS AND TISSUES. WITHIN THE

02:37:53.030 --> 02:38:02.940
HUMAN BODY. SO. WE HAVE. THE

02:38:03.006 --> 02:38:03.574
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND

02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:05.342
THEY MONITOR. DRUGS ALONG WITH

02:38:05.409 --> 02:38:08.045
THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION

02:38:08.111 --> 02:38:12.382
AND THEY. THEY PRINT ADVERSE

02:38:12.449 --> 02:38:14.751
REACTIONS THAT HAPPEN WHEN SOME

02:38:14.818 --> 02:38:18.589
POPULATIONS ARE IMMUNIZED. BUT

02:38:18.655 --> 02:38:19.623
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT

02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:21.291
EVERY ADVERSE REACTION IS

02:38:21.358 --> 02:38:23.827
PRINTED IN THE CDC GUIDELINES.

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:25.729
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT

02:38:25.796 --> 02:38:26.263
THE PATIENT AND PHYSICIAN

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:29.566
RELATIONSHIP. BECOMES SOMETHING

02:38:29.633 --> 02:38:32.870
THAT IS IMPORTANT. AND

02:38:32.936 --> 02:38:34.905
SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY.

02:38:34.972 --> 02:38:41.545
SHOULD BE RESPECTED. SO. HERE

02:38:41.612 --> 02:38:47.618
WE ARE TODAY. AND WE ALWAYS

02:38:47.684 --> 02:38:48.919
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

02:38:48.986 --> 02:38:50.787
CITIZENS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:38:50.854 --> 02:38:51.288
EXPRESS THEMSELVES IT'S

02:38:51.355 --> 02:38:56.226
DEMOCRACY. BUT AS WE HAVE SEEN

02:38:56.293 --> 02:38:57.728
SB SEVEN ONE FOUR COME TO THE

02:38:57.794 --> 02:39:01.732
FOREFRONT. I THINK IT'S GOING

02:39:01.798 --> 02:39:03.600
TO BE A MOCKERY OF DEMOCRACY.

02:39:03.667 --> 02:39:07.204
IF WE ALLOW THIS BILL. TO NOT

02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:10.274
HAVE THE ONE PUBLIC HEARING.

02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:13.543
CONTENT OF SB SEVEN ONE FOUR IS

02:39:13.610 --> 02:39:16.980
A MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE

02:39:17.047 --> 02:39:17.481
LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE

02:39:17.547 --> 02:39:22.586
PREVIOUSLY. AN ACTOR. MEMBERS

02:39:22.653 --> 02:39:25.589
LET'S GO ALL THE WAY BACK. ALL

02:39:25.656 --> 02:39:28.158
THE WAY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND

02:39:28.225 --> 02:39:29.893
FIFTEEN WHEN SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:30.460
WAS DEBATED IN THIS

02:39:30.527 --> 02:39:32.095
LEGISLATURE. I KNOW BECAUSE I

02:39:32.162 --> 02:39:37.134
WAS A PROPONENT. ONE OF THE

02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:37.634
REASONS I SUPPORT OF THE

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:40.070
MEASURE WAS BECAUSE MY- GOOD

02:39:40.137 --> 02:39:43.407
CALLING FROM SACRAMENTO.

02:39:43.473 --> 02:39:45.876
PROMISE THAT WITH ITS PASSAGE

02:39:45.943 --> 02:39:46.443
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE

02:39:46.510 --> 02:39:50.514
ALLOWED IN HONOR. BUT DON'T

02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:55.185
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. TAKE THE

02:39:55.252 --> 02:39:56.853
SENATORS WORDS ON APRIL

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:59.656
FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN.

02:39:59.723 --> 02:40:01.024
MY FRIEND THE SENATOR FROM SAN

02:40:01.091 --> 02:40:03.393
FRANISCO RELEASED A FACT

02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:05.162
VERSUS MATH PRESS RELEASE IN

02:40:05.228 --> 02:40:07.097
WHICH HE SAYS THAT IT IS FALSE.

02:40:07.164 --> 02:40:11.101
I QUOTE SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN

02:40:11.168 --> 02:40:13.003
WOULD PREVENT CHILDREN WHO NEED

02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:16.273
THEM FROM RECEIVING EXEMPTIONS.

02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:17.474
HE THEN FOLLOWED UP BY SAYING

02:40:17.541 --> 02:40:20.177
SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN LEAVES TO

02:40:20.243 --> 02:40:22.546
THE DISCRETION OF DOCTORS. WHEN

02:40:22.612 --> 02:40:24.848
A CHILD REQUIRES A MEDICAL

02:40:24.915 --> 02:40:25.482
EXEMPTION FROM REQUIRED VACCINE

02:40:25.549 --> 02:40:28.852
VACCINATIONS. CALIFORNIANS WERE

02:40:28.919 --> 02:40:31.655
TOLD AT THE TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

02:40:31.722 --> 02:40:35.692
THE EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE ALLOW.

02:40:35.759 --> 02:40:38.628
THE SENATOR AND THE LEGISLATURE.

ILLUSTRIOUS GOVERNOR SAW THE

02:40:50.007 --> 02:40:52.309
FLAWS IN SB TWO SEVENTY SIX AND-

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:59.016

US TO HEAR TODAY RIGHT NOW

02:41:07.457 --> 02:41:10.494
VOTING ON THIS BILL. THAT'S THE

02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:12.162
EQUIVALENT OF PASSING

02:41:12.229 --> 02:41:14.431
LEGISLATION IN THE DARK OF

02:41:14.498 --> 02:41:16.900

TO BE GOT AN AMENDED. WHICH I

02:41:45.262 --> 02:41:45.896

02:41:45.962 --> 02:41:48.365
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AT LEAST IT

02:41:48.432 --> 02:41:50.767
WOULD BE A PUBLIC HEARING SO

02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:02.032
BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH THE

02:44:02.098 --> 02:44:03.300

BUSINESS IT'S ON DEMOCRATIC AND

02:44:09.339 --> 02:44:12.175
EVEN WORSE I WOULD SAY IT'S A

02:44:12.242 --> 02:44:14.644
MOCKERY OF DEMOCRACY. YOU KNOW

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:32.395
THE FLOOR AND GIVING HIM AN

02:44:32.462 --> 02:44:32.963
HONEST AND EARNEST CHANCE TO

02:44:33.029 --> 02:44:35.232
PASS HIS BILL. BUT I HAVE TO BE

02:44:35.298 --> 02:44:39.002
VERY HONEST WITH YOU. THERE WAS

02:44:39.069 --> 02:44:40.804
A COUPLE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT

02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:44.207

INJURED CHILDREN. AND WHEN I

02:44:48.912 --> 02:44:52.282

02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:54.551
VACCINATIONS CAM DUE TO PEOPLE.

02:44:54.618 --> 02:44:59.389
YOU HAVE TO WONDER. THESE

02:44:59.456 --> 02:45:02.826
PEOPLE HAVE VERY GOOD POINTS TO

02:45:02.892 --> 02:45:05.161
BE CONCERNED IF THEIR CHILDREN

02:45:05.228 --> 02:45:06.830
AFTER CHILD HAD AN ANAPHYLACTIC

02:45:06.896 --> 02:45:08.665
REACTION HAD PERMANENT BRAIN

02:45:08.732 --> 02:45:11.334
DAMAGE TO IMMUNIZATION. WOULD

02:45:11.401 --> 02:45:12.769
YOU WANT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN TO

02:45:12.836 --> 02:45:14.904
BE IMMUNIZED IF IT'S A FAMILY

02:45:14.971 --> 02:45:16.673
HISTORY OF AN ADVERSE REACTION

02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:18.108
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW COULD

02:45:18.174 --> 02:45:19.276
HAPPEN TO A SECONDCHILD IN

02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:21.611
THAT SAME FAMILY. I BECAME VERY

02:45:21.678 --> 02:45:24.014
EMPATHETIC WHEN I SAW NOT ONE

02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:27.817

SEVERELY INJURED KIDS NOW. I

02:45:32.355 --> 02:45:34.357
BELIEVE THAT THESE INJURIES.

02:45:34.424 --> 02:45:37.227
ARE RARE BUT THEY HAPPEN IN

02:45:37.294 --> 02:45:37.827

BE CONCERNED. ABOUT THE HEALTH

02:45:40.964 --> 02:45:43.700

OF WANTING THEIR CHILDREN TO BE

02:48:15.518 --> 02:48:17.887
HEALTHY WHY WOULD ANY PARENT

OF DIALYSIS CENTERS CENTERS TO.

03:32:28.202 --> 03:32:30.070
COVER THE COSTS AND YES I KNOW

03:32:30.137 --> 03:32:30.871
IT'S A BAD WORD AROUND HERE

03:32:30.938 --> 03:32:33.307
MAKE A PROFIT. THEN YOU'RE JUST

03:32:33.373 --> 03:32:34.441
NOT GOING TO SEE THE GROWTH OF

03:32:34.508 --> 03:32:36.009
DIALYSIS ANDERSON IN THE IN THE

03:32:36.076 --> 03:32:36.944
HOUSE CITY CALIFORNIA

03:32:37.010 --> 03:32:39.780
ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL AREAS

03:32:39.847 --> 03:32:40.380
WHERE. FRANKLY I HAVE A LOT OF

03:32:40.447 --> 03:32:44.885
POVERTY. AND. WE'VE ALL SEEN

03:32:44.952 --> 03:32:47.788
WITH OUR CHILDHOOD OBESITY

03:32:47.855 --> 03:32:48.388
PROBLEM OUR GROWTH IN TYPE ONE

03:32:48.455 --> 03:32:51.892
DIABETES. A ONE OF A NUMBER ONE

03:32:51.959 --> 03:32:54.595
CAUSES OF KIDNEY FAILURE OR

03:32:54.661 --> 03:32:56.096
KIDNEY IS THAT ARE BEGINNING TO

03:32:56.163 --> 03:32:58.899
FAIL IS TYPE TWO DIABETES SO

03:32:58.966 --> 03:32:59.967
WE'RE SEEING A GROWTH IN THE

03:33:00.033 --> 03:33:01.802
NEED AND YET WE WANT TO PUT A

03:33:01.869 --> 03:33:04.004
CAP ON THE GROWTH OF DIALYSIS

03:33:04.071 --> 03:33:05.405
CENTERS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

03:33:05.472 --> 03:33:07.307
ALLOWING THEM TO RECOUP. THEIR

03:33:07.374 --> 03:33:08.976
COSTS AND MY FRIENDS IF THEY

03:33:09.042 --> 03:33:10.844

03:33:10.911 --> 03:33:11.945
THE NOT ALLOWED TO RECOUP THEIR

03:33:12.012 --> 03:33:14.515
COSTS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BUILD

03:33:14.581 --> 03:33:17.718
THE CENTERS AND I'M CONCERNED

03:33:17.784 --> 03:33:18.352
THAT THAT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE

03:33:18.418 --> 03:33:20.787
ACCESSIBILITY. OF NEW DIALYSIS

03:33:20.854 --> 03:33:21.388
PATIENTS THAT NEED A PLACE TO

03:33:21.455 --> 03:33:24.691
GO. WHERE THEY HAVE TO

03:33:24.758 --> 03:33:27.394
SOMETIMES GO FOUR TIMES A WEEK

03:33:27.461 --> 03:33:29.429
YEAH AND SIT FOR HOURS ON END.

03:33:29.496 --> 03:33:31.899
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER.

03:33:31.965 --> 03:33:33.600
WITNESSED A DIALYSIS PATIENT

03:33:33.667 --> 03:33:35.135
AFTER THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE

03:33:35.202 --> 03:33:37.271

03:33:37.337 --> 03:33:37.838
EXHAUSTED TAKE SOME HOURS TO

03:33:37.905 --> 03:33:46.113

03:33:46.180 --> 03:33:48.815
SO MY FRIENDS BY SUPPORTING AB

CALIFORNIA. WE SEE A LOT OF

03:34:11.572 --> 03:34:13.740

03:35:02.522 --> 03:35:04.758
INSTRUCTIVE PARTICULARLY TO ONE

03:35:04.825 --> 03:35:06.393

HUNDRED LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS

03:35:27.414 --> 03:35:27.881

03:35:27.948 --> 03:35:33.120
SERVED. 68% OF THESE PATIENTS

03:35:33.186 --> 03:35:35.088

THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

03:35:42.729 --> 03:35:44.264

03:35:44.331 --> 03:35:46.066
POPULATIONS THAT THOSE OF US

03:35:46.133 --> 03:35:48.068

THEIR HEALTHCARE. IF THERE IS

03:35:56.410 --> 03:35:59.379
NOT AN SENATE. AND COMPANIES

03:35:59.446 --> 03:36:04.451

MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I'M

A MEMBER OF HEALTH COMMITTEE

03:37:13.954 --> 03:37:16.223
AND WE HAD A LONG FASTENING

03:37:16.289 --> 03:37:18.592
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL AND

03:37:18.658 --> 03:37:19.226
LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THE BILL

03:37:19.292 --> 03:37:21.895
THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IT. IS A

03:37:21.962 --> 03:37:24.030
COMPROMISE. I WOULD LOTS OF

03:37:24.097 --> 03:37:26.299
ENGAGEMENT FROM LEADERSHIP WITH

03:37:26.366 --> 03:37:27.901
THE COMMON GOAL OF PROTECTING

03:37:27.968 --> 03:37:31.772
PATIENTS. I THINK THE MILLIONS

03:37:31.838 --> 03:37:33.373
THAT EITHER THE AMERICAN KIDNEY

03:37:33.440 --> 03:37:35.809
FINE OR WHOEVER SPENT ON BUYING

03:37:35.876 --> 03:37:38.412
COMMERCIAL TIME ON FOR THOSE

03:37:38.478 --> 03:37:40.914
COMMERCIALS WITH OFF IN THE

03:37:40.981 --> 03:37:41.415
LAST MONTH WERE HORRIBLY

03:37:41.481 --> 03:37:44.651
MISLEADING. AND I AM SADDENED

03:37:44.718 --> 03:37:46.586
OF PEOPLE BOUGHT THE RHETORIC.

03:37:46.653 --> 03:37:47.187
ON THE BILL OF GOODS THEY WERE

03:37:47.254 --> 03:37:51.425
SOLD. I FELT THAT I CONTINUE TO

03:37:51.491 --> 03:37:53.627
FOLLOW MY COLLEAGUE ON THIS

03:37:53.693 --> 03:37:55.996
FLOOR WHO YOU KNOW CONTINUES TO

03:37:56.062 --> 03:37:57.631
CLAIM THAT WE ARE BOUGHT AND

03:37:57.697 --> 03:37:59.132
SOLD BY AN ENTITY AND I HAVE TO

03:37:59.199 --> 03:38:00.667
SAY ONCE AGAIN PARTICULARLY

03:38:00.734 --> 03:38:02.836
AFTER THE RESOLUTION TALK ABOUT

03:38:02.903 --> 03:38:03.470
SIXTY NINETEEN THAT I'M NOT FOR

03:38:03.537 --> 03:38:08.642
SALE. AND I HAVE TO GET MY CUP

03:38:08.708 --> 03:38:09.176
FOR SADDAM TO FOLLOW THAT

03:38:09.242 --> 03:38:12.379
ANYMORE. THE AMERICAN KIDNEY

03:38:12.446 --> 03:38:14.181
FUNDS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION

03:38:14.247 --> 03:38:15.749
WHICH STRUCK ME AS A NON PROFIT

03:38:15.816 --> 03:38:19.019
EXECUTIVE. PRIOR TO BECOMING

03:38:19.085 --> 03:38:21.455
ELECTED I WAS STRUCK AT THE

03:38:21.521 --> 03:38:23.423
PERCENTAGE OF THIS NONPROFIT

03:38:23.490 --> 03:38:27.027
FUNDING THAT COMES FROM. TO

03:38:27.093 --> 03:38:31.598
DONORS. IN NONPROFIT ACCOUNTING

03:38:31.665 --> 03:38:33.834
IRS RULES ARE VERY PARTICULAR

03:38:33.900 --> 03:38:35.335
ABOUT THE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR

03:38:35.402 --> 03:38:37.037
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND YOU

03:38:37.103 --> 03:38:38.839
CAN'T HAVE ALL YOUR CA FUNDING

03:38:38.905 --> 03:38:40.740
COMING FROM A SINGLE SOURCE

03:38:40.807 --> 03:38:43.143
BECAUSE THE IN INFERENCE IS

03:38:43.210 --> 03:38:45.679
THAT THAT IS SIMPLY A WAY IN

03:38:45.745 --> 03:38:47.447
WHICH THE- THE PRIVATE

03:38:47.514 --> 03:38:49.449
ORGANIZATION IS GETTING A TAX

03:38:49.516 --> 03:38:51.618
WRITE OFF. ON BY HAVING THE

03:38:51.685 --> 03:38:52.919
NONPROFIT QUOTE UNQUOTE THAT

03:38:52.986 --> 03:38:54.654
THEY HAVE COMPLETE ON

03:38:54.721 --> 03:38:55.989
JURISDICTION OVER AND SO THAT

03:38:56.056 --> 03:38:58.191
WAS AN ISSUE THAT WE BROUGHT UP

03:38:58.258 --> 03:38:59.426
REPEATEDLY DURING THE COMMITTEE

03:38:59.493 --> 03:39:02.929
IT WAS A CONCERN. SEPARATE FROM

03:39:02.996 --> 03:39:04.030
WHAT THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN

03:39:04.097 --> 03:39:05.732
CLAIM THEY WERE DOING IT WAS

03:39:05.799 --> 03:39:09.436
REALLY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE

03:39:09.503 --> 03:39:09.970
A TRUE INDEPENDENT NOT FOR

03:39:10.036 --> 03:39:13.907
PROFIT ORGANIZATION. NOT BEING

03:39:13.974 --> 03:39:15.108
STEERED CALL STEERAGE NONPROFIT

03:39:15.175 --> 03:39:17.010
ACCOUNTING. LOOK IT UP. ARMED

03:39:17.077 --> 03:39:18.812
WITH 82% OF THEIR FUNDS COMING

03:39:18.879 --> 03:39:20.947
FROM THE LARGEST I OFFICE

03:39:21.014 --> 03:39:23.116
COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT

03:39:23.183 --> 03:39:24.150
WAS A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF

03:39:24.217 --> 03:39:24.751
REALLY DETERMINE WHETHER THEY

03:39:24.818 --> 03:39:26.686
WERE INDEPENDENT. NUMBER TWO

03:39:26.753 --> 03:39:30.824
BALANCE BILLING. IS AN ISSUE

03:39:30.891 --> 03:39:31.424
THAT WE HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST

03:39:31.491 --> 03:39:33.860
ON THE REGULAR. IT'S NOT ABOUT

03:39:33.927 --> 03:39:35.629
NOT ALLOWING A PRIVATE ENTITIES

03:39:35.695 --> 03:39:38.798
TO EARN PROFIT. IT'S WHO

03:39:38.865 --> 03:39:39.332
THEY'RE GOING TO EARN THE

03:39:39.399 --> 03:39:41.401
PROFIT ON THE BACKS OF AND

03:39:41.468 --> 03:39:43.503
MAKING SURE THAT THESE

03:39:43.570 --> 03:39:46.506
VULNERABLE PATIENTS. WHO DO

03:39:46.573 --> 03:39:49.776
RELY ON THEIR ABILITY TO DIAL

03:39:49.843 --> 03:39:51.945
SITES FREQUENTLY BUT IT'S NOT

03:39:52.012 --> 03:39:54.981
BALANCED ON THEIR BACK. THE

03:39:55.048 --> 03:39:56.349
AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND AS I

03:39:56.416 --> 03:39:58.285
RECALL DIDN'T OPERATE DIALYSIS

03:39:58.351 --> 03:39:59.853
CLINICS INDEPENDENTLY SO IT'S

03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:01.821
NOT ABOUT THE LIMITATION OF

03:40:01.888 --> 03:40:02.956
CLINICS THAT ANOTHER

03:40:03.023 --> 03:40:05.559
MISSTATEMENT. IT'S ABOUT

03:40:05.625 --> 03:40:07.460
BALANCE BILLING AND WHO COVERS

03:40:07.527 --> 03:40:09.195
THE COST TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND

03:40:09.262 --> 03:40:10.430
WHAT THEIR INSURANCE ALREADY

03:40:10.497 --> 03:40:12.666
COVERS. AND SO HEALTH INSURANCE

03:40:12.732 --> 03:40:13.833
COMPANIES AS A RESULT OF THIS

03:40:13.900 --> 03:40:16.536
BILL WILL BE REQUIRED TO COVER

03:40:16.603 --> 03:40:18.471
PATIENTS WHOSE PREMIUMS HAVE

03:40:18.538 --> 03:40:20.307
HISTORICALLY BEEN PID BY THE

NOT LOSE. A MINUTE. OF THEIR

03:40:36.323 --> 03:40:38.692
OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE DIALYSIS

03:40:38.758 --> 03:40:41.461
SERVICES. BECAUSE HEALTH

03:40:41.528 --> 03:40:43.797
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

03:40:43.863 --> 03:40:48.368
REQUIRED TO COVER THAT EXPENSE.

03:40:48.435 --> 03:40:50.070
YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO

03:40:50.136 --> 03:40:51.504

TIMES PER MONTH. THAT INCLUDED

03:41:07.921 --> 03:41:11.858
DIALYSIS PATIENTS. AND SO IN

03:41:11.925 --> 03:41:13.860
OUR INABILITY TO GET A BUDGET

03:41:13.927 --> 03:41:16.596
THROUGH BOTH HOUSES WE

03:41:16.663 --> 03:41:18.431
COMPROMISE THE LIVES OF

03:41:18.498 --> 03:41:20.400
DIALYSIS PATIENTS IN A VERY

03:41:20.467 --> 03:41:22.268
DIRECT WAY THOSE WHO RECEIVE

03:41:22.335 --> 03:41:24.904
MEDICARE HOW QUICKLY WE FORGET

03:41:24.971 --> 03:41:27.707
THIS BILL IS AN IMPROVEMENT OF

03:41:27.774 --> 03:41:30.443
STATUS QUO. IT ELIMINATES

03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:31.911
BALANCE BILLING WHICH IS A BAD

03:41:31.978 --> 03:41:34.447
THING FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR FOR

03:41:34.514 --> 03:41:36.883
PATIENTS AND AGAIN IT WILL

03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:37.951
REQUIRE THE HEALTH INSURANCE

03:41:38.018 --> 03:41:39.886
COMPANIES PROVIDE THE COVERAGE

03:41:39.953 --> 03:41:42.589
FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS I'LL

03:41:42.656 --> 03:41:43.623

WE'RE TOLD THAT THE MINUTES

03:41:55.435 --> 03:41:57.037
WERE MADE BETTER IN IT WOULD

03:41:57.103 --> 03:41:58.805
PROTECT THE THIRTY SEVEN

03:41:58.872 --> 03:41:59.706
HUNDRED PATIENTS THAT WE HAVE

03:41:59.773 --> 03:42:02.142
MOSTLY FOR MINORITY MAJORITY

03:42:02.208 --> 03:42:04.044
DISTRICTS AND THE POOR THEY

03:42:04.110 --> 03:42:05.478
CAN'T AFFORD SOME OF THE

03:42:05.545 --> 03:42:06.379
BENEFITS THAT COME WITH

03:42:06.446 --> 03:42:08.448
DIALYSIS TREATMENT AT IT

03:42:08.515 --> 03:42:10.150
DOESN'T DO THAT IT ACTUALLY

03:42:10.216 --> 03:42:12.052
COME LOOSE THE SITUATION EVEN

03:42:12.118 --> 03:42:15.722
MORE. AND YOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR

03:42:15.789 --> 03:42:17.457
MY COLLEAGUES SAY THAT NO ONE'S

03:42:17.524 --> 03:42:19.392
GONNA LOSE THEIR BENEFITS AND

03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:20.960
THE AMERICAN CAN DEFEND IS

03:42:21.027 --> 03:42:22.095
GOING TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA.

03:42:22.162 --> 03:42:24.264
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE IF YOU

03:42:24.330 --> 03:42:25.899
OPERATE ANY NONPROFIT OR A

03:42:25.965 --> 03:42:28.068
BUSINESS. AND JUST A SMALL

03:42:28.134 --> 03:42:29.602
PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ASSETS ARE

03:42:29.669 --> 03:42:31.204
IN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA IS

03:42:31.271 --> 03:42:32.338
CREATING SOMETHING THAT COULD

03:42:32.405 --> 03:42:34.574
CAUSE YOU. TO LOSE YOUR ENTIRE

03:42:34.641 --> 03:42:36.376
NATIONAL STATUS AS AN

TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND CUT IT

03:42:39.479 --> 03:42:41.881
LOOSE AND SO THAT'S EXACTLY

03:42:41.948 --> 03:42:43.049
WHAT THE AMERICAN CAN DEFEND IS

03:42:43.116 --> 03:42:46.252
GOING TO DO. YES INSURANCE

03:42:46.319 --> 03:42:47.187
COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO COVER

03:42:47.253 --> 03:42:49.789
THIS AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE THAT

03:42:49.856 --> 03:42:52.125
ARE WAITING ON DIALYSIS. THAT

03:42:52.192 --> 03:42:53.159

SURVIVE THE THREE TO SIX MONTHS

03:42:56.496 --> 03:42:59.199
PROCESS TO GET. THEIR INSURANCE

03:42:59.265 --> 03:43:01.034
TO APPROVE IT AND THINGS WILL

03:43:01.101 --> 03:43:03.136
GO SMOOTHLY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE

03:43:03.203 --> 03:43:04.838
IS THAT VOTING FOR THIS BILL

03:43:04.904 --> 03:43:07.273
WILL STOP. THE AMERICAN KIDNEY

03:43:07.340 --> 03:43:08.374
FUND FROM OPERATING IN THE

03:43:08.441 --> 03:43:12.178
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S

03:43:12.245 --> 03:43:13.780
NOT A THREAT IT'S JUST LOOKING

03:43:13.847 --> 03:43:14.247
AT IT FROM A BUSINESS

03:43:14.314 --> 03:43:16.516
PERSPECTIVE AND SAYING YOU KNOW

03:43:16.583 --> 03:43:17.884
WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR THE

03:43:17.951 --> 03:43:19.385
OTHER FORTY NINE STATES AND THE

03:43:19.452 --> 03:43:20.887
PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. AND IF

03:43:20.954 --> 03:43:22.322
THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE A

03:43:22.388 --> 03:43:23.389
PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA THEN WE

03:43:23.456 --> 03:43:26.159
WILL JUST STEM. CUT LOOSE AND I

03:43:26.226 --> 03:43:27.594
HAVE REALLY GREAT CONCERNS

03:43:27.660 --> 03:43:29.129
BECAUSE THERE ARE THIRTY SEVEN

03:43:29.195 --> 03:43:30.196
HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT NEED THIS

03:43:30.263 --> 03:43:33.133
SERVICE IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE.

03:43:33.199 --> 03:43:33.666
IF YOU HAVE NOT VISITED A

03:43:33.733 --> 03:43:35.268
DIALYSIS CENTER IN YOUR

03:43:35.335 --> 03:43:36.936
DISTRICT I WOULD ASK YOU TO DO

03:43:37.003 --> 03:43:39.339
THAT. WHEN I WAS ASKED TO GO I

03:43:39.405 --> 03:43:40.473
REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO GO

03:43:40.540 --> 03:43:42.041
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE.

03:43:42.108 --> 03:43:43.443
WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA SEE

03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:44.644
AND WHEN I WENT INTO THE

03:43:44.711 --> 03:43:46.045
DIALYSIS CENTER IT WASN'T

03:43:46.112 --> 03:43:47.680
ANYTHING LIKE I THOUGHT. THEY

03:43:47.747 --> 03:43:49.149
WERE YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY WERE

03:43:49.215 --> 03:43:52.018
TEENAGERS THERE WERE MADE IT

03:43:52.085 --> 03:43:53.953
MIDDLE AGED INDIVIDUALS THERE

03:43:54.020 --> 03:43:55.188
WERE MOMS THERE WERE MORE

03:43:55.255 --> 03:43:57.824
VETERANS. THEY WERE JUST PEOPLE

03:43:57.891 --> 03:43:59.092
TRYING TO STAY ALIVE IN WHEN

03:43:59.159 --> 03:44:01.027
THEY EAT SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO

03:44:01.094 --> 03:44:02.529
GO IN TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK

03:44:02.595 --> 03:44:04.330
FOR SEVERAL HOURS A DAY. AND

03:44:04.397 --> 03:44:05.965
THE STAFF IS REALLY FRIENDLY

03:44:06.032 --> 03:44:08.468
AND I JUST THINK THAT THAT TIME

03:44:08.535 --> 03:44:09.803
ATTACKING THIS PARTICULAR

03:44:09.869 --> 03:44:11.471
INDUSTRY. CAUSES THE

03:44:11.538 --> 03:44:14.007
DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO OUR-

03:44:14.073 --> 03:44:19.579
CONSTITUENTS. AND I REALLY DO

03:44:19.646 --> 03:44:20.213
BELIEVE WHAT THE AMERICAN CAN

03:44:20.280 --> 03:44:21.147
DEFEND SAYS. THAT THEY WILL CUT

03:44:21.214 --> 03:44:21.748
THEIR LOSSES IN CALIFORNIA AND

03:44:21.815 --> 03:44:23.817
WE WILL HAVE. AN INTERRUPTION

03:44:23.883 --> 03:44:25.418
OF SERVICE AND POSSIBLY NOT

03:44:25.485 --> 03:44:27.187
HAVE SERVICE. FOR INDIVIDUALS

03:44:27.253 --> 03:44:29.055
WHO ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF

03:44:29.122 --> 03:44:30.523
THIS SERVICE. AND I THINK WE

03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:31.391
NEED TO THINK ABOUT OUR

03:44:31.457 --> 03:44:33.726
CONSTITUENTS. I'M SURE ONE OF

03:44:33.793 --> 03:44:35.328
THOSE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED

03:44:35.395 --> 03:44:36.296
PEOPLE LIVES IN MY DISTRICT.

03:44:36.362 --> 03:44:37.330
AND THE REST OF THEM ROOM

03:44:37.397 --> 03:44:39.799
SOMEONE LIVING YOUR DISTRICT

03:44:39.866 --> 03:44:40.400
AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU

03:44:40.466 --> 03:44:42.068
VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. IS THERE

03:44:42.135 --> 03:44:42.602
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR

03:44:42.669 --> 03:44:47.173
DEBATE. SEEING NONE SENATOR

03:44:47.240 --> 03:44:49.642
LEYVA YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK

03:44:49.709 --> 03:44:51.578
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU

03:44:51.644 --> 03:44:53.813
FOR THE ROBUST A CONVERSATION

03:44:53.880 --> 03:44:56.716
AND DEBATE IF SOME OF IT IS NOT

03:44:56.783 --> 03:45:00.920
ACCURATE. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE

03:45:00.987 --> 03:45:02.422
OUT WHERE I WANT TO START WITH

03:45:02.488 --> 03:45:03.990
ALL OF THE INACCURACIES I THINK

03:45:04.057 --> 03:45:05.725
THE FIRST THING THAT I WANT TO

03:45:05.792 --> 03:45:07.260
START WITH IS TO THE SENATOR IN

03:45:07.327 --> 03:45:09.796
TEMECULA WONDERING WHY HE'S SO

03:45:09.863 --> 03:45:11.264
AFRAID OF UNIONS AND SO AFRAID

03:45:11.331 --> 03:45:13.967
OF LABOR. AND FOR MYSELF AS

03:45:14.033 --> 03:45:15.001
SOMEONE WHO SPENT THIRTY YEARS

03:45:15.068 --> 03:45:17.136
AS EITHER A UNION MEMBER AS

03:45:17.203 --> 03:45:18.738
SOMEONE WHO RAN MY OWN LOCAL

03:45:18.805 --> 03:45:21.040
UNION WHO IS THE PRESENT THE

03:45:21.107 --> 03:45:23.343
CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION.

03:45:23.409 --> 03:45:25.044
LABOR DOESN'T SUPPORT ME I AM

03:45:25.111 --> 03:45:27.180
LABOR SO I TAKE OFFENSE WHEN

03:45:27.247 --> 03:45:28.948
YOU SAY THAT LABOR OWNS ANY OF

03:45:29.015 --> 03:45:32.452
US I AM LABOR. OUR I DON'T SEE

03:45:32.518 --> 03:45:34.053
HOW PATIENTS ARE PUT IN IN

03:45:34.120 --> 03:45:36.823
HARM'S WAY IN THIS BILL NO ONE

03:45:36.890 --> 03:45:38.758
IS GOING TO LOSE COVERAGE BUT

03:45:38.825 --> 03:45:40.059
THAT'S A FEAR TALK TALKING

03:45:40.126 --> 03:45:41.427
POINT RIGHT WE WANT TO SCARE

THE PAGE AND START TO MAKE OUR

04:24:41.632 --> 04:24:43.634
LAWS BETTER TO PREVENT THESE

04:24:43.701 --> 04:24:44.168
KINDS OF TRAGEDIES IN THE

04:24:44.235 --> 04:24:49.106
FUTURE. WE'VE WE'VE SEEN

04:24:49.173 --> 04:24:50.641
IMPASSES REACHED WHEN PEOPLE

04:25:21.639 --> 04:25:22.640

NOTICING HEARING. SO NOW THAT A

04:25:37.655 --> 04:25:42.359
DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS RIGHTS.

04:25:42.426 --> 04:25:42.860
BUT CERTAINLY WITH MORE

04:25:42.926 --> 04:25:43.427
JUDICIAL DISCRETION THAT WE

04:25:43.494 --> 04:25:45.496
HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE HOPE THIS

04:25:45.562 --> 04:25:47.531
BILL WILL ALLEVIATE A BURDEN ON

04:25:47.598 --> 04:25:48.999
COURTS AS WELL IN THE LAWN

04:25:49.066 --> 04:25:50.167
FORCING THE BUREAUCRACY BUT

04:25:50.234 --> 04:25:51.835
ALSO ON FAMILIES WHO HAVE TO

04:25:51.902 --> 04:25:54.338
FACE. AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.

04:25:54.405 --> 04:25:54.938
HEALTHY BRING SOME COMFORT TO

04:25:55.005 --> 04:25:57.941
THE VICTIMS. THIS BILL ALSO

04:25:58.008 --> 04:25:58.776
MAKES THREE OTHER IMPORTANT

04:25:58.842 --> 04:26:01.045
CLARIFYING CHANGES TO MAKE GUN

04:26:01.111 --> 04:26:01.612
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS

04:26:01.679 --> 04:26:03.547
MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE.

04:26:03.614 --> 04:26:05.249
BY ALLOWING AGENCIES TO FILE IN

04:26:05.316 --> 04:26:06.450

04:26:15.092 --> 04:26:18.329
EMERGENCY CONTACTS. WE CAN

04:26:18.395 --> 04:26:20.164
NEVER SAY THAT ONE LAW WOULD

04:26:20.230 --> 04:26:20.698
HAVE STOPPED A PARTICULAR

04:26:20.764 --> 04:26:22.866
SHOOTING. I THINK SOMETIMES IT

04:26:22.933 --> 04:26:26.236
IS BEYOND US. BUT IT IS OUR

04:26:26.303 --> 04:26:28.072
DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING WE HAVE

04:26:28.138 --> 04:26:30.841
THE POWER TO DO UNDER OUR LAW.

04:26:30.908 --> 04:26:32.776
SOME COMFORT. TO THE VICTIMS

04:26:32.843 --> 04:26:36.280
AND SOME SAFETY. THOSE MILLION

04:26:36.347 --> 04:26:37.081
THE SCHOOL KIDS AROUND THIS

04:26:37.147 --> 04:26:39.083
COUNTRY WHO FEAR IT SOOTING

04:26:39.149 --> 04:26:41.118
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND

04:26:41.185 --> 04:26:42.686
YET. THE RISK OF THAT HAPPENING.

04:26:42.753 --> 04:26:46.156
IS SO MINUTE. BUT IT DOMINATES

04:26:46.223 --> 04:26:49.059
OUR PUBLIC PSYCHE RIGHT NOW. WE

04:26:49.126 --> 04:26:50.728
HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES HERE TO

04:26:50.794 --> 04:26:52.162
TURN THE PAGE ON THIS GUN

04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:53.764
VIOLENCE DEBATE WE HOPE WITH

04:26:53.831 --> 04:26:55.866
THE BI PARTISAN MOVE WE MADE

04:26:55.933 --> 04:26:57.368
WITH AB TWELVE WE CAN START TO

04:26:57.434 --> 04:26:59.236
TURN THAT PAGE AND BEGIN TO

04:27:00.604 --> 04:27:03.474
ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU CENTER

STERN DISCUSSION AND DEBATE

04:27:04.108 --> 04:27:07.378
SENATOR NIELSEN. NOT A

04:27:07.444 --> 04:27:09.179
PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN THE SENATE

04:27:09.246 --> 04:27:11.648
WHERE THIS IS STAND ALONE BILL.

04:27:11.715 --> 04:27:13.384
I WOULD FIND SAMARITAN. BUT IT

04:27:13.450 --> 04:27:17.454
IS NOT. IN FACT IRONICALLY IT

04:27:17.521 --> 04:27:19.857
FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE CORE

04:27:19.923 --> 04:27:21.959
ELEMENTS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

04:27:22.025 --> 04:27:22.593
REFORM THAT WE'RE IN THE THROES

04:27:22.659 --> 04:27:26.330
OF NOW. INCLUDING DIMINISHING

04:27:26.397 --> 04:27:27.831
THE CONSEQUENCES FOR ONE WHO

04:27:27.898 --> 04:27:29.700
USES. A GUN IN THE COMMISSION

04:27:29.767 --> 04:27:33.570
OF A CRIME. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

04:27:33.637 --> 04:27:34.104
TO BE IN TWO ENHANCEMENTS

04:27:34.171 --> 04:27:38.675
ANYMORE. AND GETTING PEOPLE OUT

04:27:38.742 --> 04:27:40.110
OF PRISON EARLIER IS THE GOAL.

04:27:40.177 --> 04:27:44.381
NOT LATER. NOT ATER BECAUSE OF

04:27:44.448 --> 04:27:46.517
ENHANCEMENTS LIKE USE A GUN GO

04:27:46.583 --> 04:27:48.085
TO PRISON THAT THE PEOPLE OF

04:27:48.152 --> 04:27:48.652
CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR A LONG

04:27:48.719 --> 04:27:52.523

RESTRAINING ORDER. TWO FIVE

04:28:00.130 --> 04:28:04.902
YEARS. WELL WOULD THAT HELP IN

04:28:04.968 --> 04:28:06.370
SOME WAY I WOULD ASSUME IT

04:28:06.437 --> 04:28:08.839
WOULD BUT AGAIN I'M ARGUING IN

04:28:08.906 --> 04:28:11.175
THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THE

04:28:11.241 --> 04:28:11.775
OTHER. ATTEMPTS THAT HAVE BEEN

04:28:11.842 --> 04:28:17.514
MADE. TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE.

04:28:17.581 --> 04:28:19.383
CHICAGO FOR EXAMPLE MURDER

04:28:19.450 --> 04:28:22.586

04:28:22.653 --> 04:28:26.657
GUN LAWS IN AMERICA. IN EVERY

04:28:26.723 --> 04:28:28.125
DAY WERE COMING UP WITH NEW

04:28:28.192 --> 04:28:30.461
IDEAS TO DIMINISH THE

04:28:30.527 --> 04:28:30.928
CONSEQUENCES FOR CRIME

04:28:30.994 --> 04:28:36.166
INCLUDING. WITH GUNS. AS I

04:28:36.233 --> 04:28:39.603
NOTED A LITTLE BIT AGO. IT

04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:42.973
HASN'T EVEN BEEN A PRIORITY. IN

04:28:43.040 --> 04:28:44.508
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE

04:28:44.575 --> 04:28:46.844
GUNS AWAY FROM THOSE WHO WERE

04:28:46.910 --> 04:28:50.481
PROHIBITED FROM HAVING GUNS. A

04:28:50.547 --> 04:28:52.683
BACKLOG WAS OVER TWENTY

04:28:52.749 --> 04:28:55.152
THOUSAND GUNS NOW NOT GUTS.

04:28:55.219 --> 04:28:57.354
THAT WOULD BE INDIVIDUALS WHO

04:28:57.421 --> 04:28:59.122
WERE PROHIBITED FROM HAVING

04:28:59.189 --> 04:29:01.358
GUNS IN ALMOST EVERY ONE OF

04:29:01.425 --> 04:29:01.959

04:29:02.025 --> 04:29:06.063
GUN. YOU EXTRAPOLATE THE NUMBER

04:29:06.129 --> 04:29:07.331

04:29:07.397 --> 04:29:09.466
CONFISCATED THAT BY LAW SHOULD

04:29:09.533 --> 04:29:10.100
HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME AGO YEARS

04:29:10.167 --> 04:29:15.606
AGO. SO THIS MAY BE FEEL GOOD.

04:29:15.672 --> 04:29:18.308
BUT DON'T BE DECEIVED. TAKEN IN

04:29:18.375 --> 04:29:20.911

A LITTLE BIT. THE KIND OF

04:46:32.542 --> 04:46:34.911
THERE'S BEEN A HUGE GROWTH. OF

04:46:34.977 --> 04:46:39.515
THOSE FAMILY SAYING NO. PUBLIC

04:46:39.582 --> 04:46:40.149

NOW WE DON'T TO DO TESTING

04:46:52.862 --> 04:46:54.363
ANYMORE BECAUSE PUBLIC

04:46:54.430 --> 04:46:56.098

04:46:56.165 --> 04:46:59.135
CONTINUED BOTTOM RATINGS WE

04:46:59.201 --> 04:47:02.338
WERE RECEIVING. BUT IT

04:47:02.405 --> 04:47:04.974
CERTAINLY WAS SOMETHING THAT

04:47:05.041 --> 04:47:05.608
PARENTS HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THAT

04:47:05.675 --> 04:47:07.209
THEIR CHILDREN DID BETTER. IN

04:47:07.276 --> 04:47:11.914
OTHER SETTINGS. AND WHAT THESE

04:47:11.981 --> 04:47:13.482
MINI SERIES OF BILLS OVER THE

04:47:13.549 --> 04:47:17.453

04:47:17.520 --> 04:47:20.156
AS THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY DOES

04:47:20.222 --> 04:47:21.991
IMPOSE ON CHARTER SCHOOLS THE

04:47:22.058 --> 04:47:24.193
VERY SAME FACT DOORS THAT HAVE

04:47:24.260 --> 04:47:25.828
MADE OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION

04:47:25.895 --> 04:47:29.165

04:47:29.231 --> 04:47:31.000
OUR HIGHEST STANDARD AND HOPE

04:47:31.067 --> 04:47:32.735

04:47:32.802 --> 04:47:37.473

04:47:40.109 --> 04:47:43.145
TRANSPARENCY. IS ACTUALLY MORE

04:47:43.212 --> 04:47:46.182
OF A COVER. FOR THE FAILURES OF

04:47:46.248 --> 04:47:49.619
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THAT IT IS A

04:47:49.685 --> 04:47:52.088
NEED TO BE IMPOSED ON CHARTER

04:47:52.154 --> 04:47:54.290

HAD RAISE SOME VERY IMPORTANT

04:48:04.500 --> 04:48:07.370
AND SERIOUS POINTS. I THINK THE

04:48:07.436 --> 04:48:08.638
FACT THAT WE NEED CHARTER

04:48:08.704 --> 04:48:11.073
SCHOOLS BELIES THE FACT THAT

04:48:11.140 --> 04:48:13.409
MANY OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

04:48:13.476 --> 04:48:14.910
HAVE NOT BEEN PERFORMING UP TO

04:48:14.977 --> 04:48:17.146
PAR AND I COME FROM AN AND A

04:48:17.213 --> 04:48:18.848
FAMILY OF EDUCATORS AND I

04:48:18.914 --> 04:48:21.484
MYSELF WAS AN EDUCATOR IN MY

04:48:21.550 --> 04:48:23.019

04:48:23.085 --> 04:48:28.658

04:48:35.665 --> 04:48:38.634
PROPERLY REPRESENTING THE FAX.

04:48:38.701 --> 04:48:39.902
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU

04:48:39.969 --> 04:48:41.671
THAT I'VE VOTE AT THE LOCAL

CHARTER SCHOOLS BE HELD

04:48:45.307 --> 04:48:47.977
ACCOUNTABLE BY THE BROWN ACT. I

04:48:48.044 --> 04:48:49.211
DON'T BELIEVE THAT A PUBLIC

04:48:49.278 --> 04:48:50.346
INSTITUTION SHOULD CONDUCT

04:48:50.413 --> 04:48:52.314
ITSELF IN PRIVATE IN THAT

04:48:52.381 --> 04:48:53.582
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS SHOULD BE

04:48:53.649 --> 04:48:55.785
HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PARENTS

04:48:55.851 --> 04:48:57.953
AND THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND

04:48:58.020 --> 04:49:00.523
I EXPRESS THAT. I WANT TO MAKE

04:49:00.589 --> 04:49:01.724
CERTAIN THAT ARE CHARTER

04:49:01.791 --> 04:49:03.926
SCHOOLS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY

04:49:03.993 --> 04:49:05.895
THE BROWN ACT. AND THERE'S A

04:49:05.961 --> 04:49:08.064
NUMBER OF OTHER INSTANCES LIKE

04:49:08.130 --> 04:49:08.831
THAT WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE

04:49:08.898 --> 04:49:10.566
CERTAIN THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS

04:49:10.633 --> 04:49:12.835
ARE BROUGHT UP TO PAR IN TERMS

04:49:12.902 --> 04:49:15.271
OF TRANSPARENCY IN MANDATORY

04:49:15.337 --> 04:49:16.138
DISCLOSURES. THAT WE HOLD TO

04:49:16.205 --> 04:49:18.174
OTHER INSTITUTIONS. BUT THE

04:49:18.240 --> 04:49:19.575
REASON WHY CHARTER SCHOOLS

04:49:19.642 --> 04:49:22.311
EXIST IS BECAUSE MANY OF OUR

04:49:22.378 --> 04:49:24.413
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC AGE

04:49:24.480 --> 04:49:27.416
INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT PERFORMING

04:49:27.483 --> 04:49:27.983
PROPERLY IN THIS IS A SAFETY

04:49:28.050 --> 04:49:30.653
GAP. THIS IS A SAFETY VALVE

04:49:30.720 --> 04:49:31.954
THAT HELPS OUR COMMUNITY I

04:49:32.021 --> 04:49:34.523
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A WAY THAT

04:49:34.590 --> 04:49:36.425
WE CAN SELF CORRECT NOT ONLY

04:49:36.492 --> 04:49:37.359
THROUGH CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH A

04:49:37.426 --> 04:49:40.196
LEARN THE LESSONS LEARNED. FROM

04:49:40.262 --> 04:49:41.430
THEIR EXPERIENCE INTO THE

04:49:41.497 --> 04:49:43.899
PUBLIC SETTING. SO THE IDEA

04:49:43.966 --> 04:49:44.934
THAT THIS IS ABOUT

04:49:45.000 --> 04:49:46.635
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS IS ABOUT

04:49:46.702 --> 04:49:48.738
MAKING CERTAIN THAT PARENTS ARE

04:49:48.804 --> 04:49:51.073
PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCESS.

04:49:51.140 --> 04:49:52.208
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU

04:49:52.274 --> 04:49:53.776
THAT IN MY BACKYARD I WAS A

04:49:53.843 --> 04:49:55.678
PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT

04:49:55.745 --> 04:49:57.279
WANT TO CREATE A CHARTER SCHOOL

04:49:57.346 --> 04:49:58.914
THAT EVEN PROMOTED THE IDEA OF

04:49:58.981 --> 04:50:00.549
MAKING CERTAIN THAT UNION.

04:50:00.616 --> 04:50:03.419
FACULTY UNITES FACULTY WERE

04:50:03.486 --> 04:50:06.021
PART OF THIS NEW CHARTER ENTITY.

04:50:06.088 --> 04:50:08.424
THIS GOES FAR BEYOND THAT. I

04:50:08.491 --> 04:50:10.126
DON'T CARE HOW YOU GHOST

04:50:10.192 --> 04:50:11.994
THROUGH WITH BENIGN LANGUAGE.

04:50:12.061 --> 04:50:14.830
THIS IS A DID THIS IS A DESIRE

04:50:14.897 --> 04:50:15.998
BY FOLKS WHO OPPOSE CHARTER

04:50:16.065 --> 04:50:18.367
SCHOOLS. TO ME TO BRING IT DOWN

04:50:18.434 --> 04:50:21.070
PERFORMANCE WITH INTRUSIVE AND

04:50:21.137 --> 04:50:23.639
OVERLY BURDENSOME REGULATIONS.

04:50:23.706 --> 04:50:25.207
TO CREATE A PLAYING FIELD THAT

04:50:25.274 --> 04:50:26.475
IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE

04:50:26.542 --> 04:50:27.376
BUREAUCRACY THAT WE SEE IN

04:50:27.443 --> 04:50:28.577
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS I THINK

04:50:28.644 --> 04:50:30.112
THAT'S- THAT'S A TRAVESTY IN MY

04:50:30.179 --> 04:50:31.914
OPINION. I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY

04:50:31.981 --> 04:50:33.582
CALL IS COLLEAGUES TO SEE THIS

04:50:33.649 --> 04:50:35.818
AS IT IS. A MEASURE TO BRING

04:50:35.885 --> 04:50:38.587
BACK BRING DOWN CHARTER SCHOOLS

04:50:38.654 --> 04:50:40.723
TO A POINT WHERE THERE IS NO.

04:50:40.790 --> 04:50:43.893
DISPARITY IN PERFORMANCE

04:50:43.959 --> 04:50:44.527
OUTCOMES AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE

04:50:44.593 --> 04:50:47.897
PAST. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS

04:50:59.375 --> 04:51:00.976
EARLY DAYS OF OUR LEGISLATIVE

04:51:01.043 --> 04:51:02.711
YEAR WITH. A COMPROMISE WAS

04:51:02.778 --> 04:51:04.480
FORGED BETWEEN THE PUBLIC

COULD CUT AND THE WAR AND TRY

04:51:14.456 --> 04:51:15.357
TO COME TOGETHER AND TOGETHER

04:51:15.424 --> 04:51:17.960
WE DID PASS LEGISLATION. TO PUT

04:51:18.027 --> 04:51:18.828
THOSE REQUIREMENTS ON PUBLIC

04:51:18.894 --> 04:51:20.696
CHARTER SCHOOLS IN WHEN. WE HAD

04:51:20.763 --> 04:51:21.997
THE DEBATE ON THIS FLOOR I

04:51:22.064 --> 04:51:23.866
TALKED ABOUT I HOPE THAT THIS

04:51:23.933 --> 04:51:24.567
WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

04:51:24.633 --> 04:51:25.267
FIND PLACES WE CAN COME

04:51:25.334 --> 04:51:27.570
TOGETHER. AND NOT CONTINUE THIS

04:51:27.636 --> 04:51:29.638
PERPETUAL WAR BETWEEN THESE

04:51:29.705 --> 04:51:31.340
DIFFERENT INTEREST GROUPS AND

04:51:31.407 --> 04:51:33.709

04:51:33.776 --> 04:51:37.346
BEFORE US. AND WHAT STRIKES ME

04:51:37.413 --> 04:51:37.847
MORE THAN ANYTHING ABOUT

04:51:37.913 --> 04:51:39.882
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS IS THAT.

04:51:39.949 --> 04:51:43.552
IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WE HAVE

04:51:43.619 --> 04:51:45.354
OVER SEVEN HUNDRED PUBLIC

BURDEN ON PUBLIC CHARTER

THE FLOOR OF THIS LEGISLATURE

04:53:34.196 --> 04:53:36.031

04:53:38.834 --> 04:53:41.003
WITH GOOD INTENTIONS BUT GOES

04:53:41.070 --> 04:53:42.104
AGAINST EVERYTHING WE TRIED TO

04:53:42.171 --> 04:53:44.106
ESTABLISH IN THE PUBLIC CHARTER

04:53:44.173 --> 04:53:45.908

THEY WANT TO GIVE THERE'S CHILD

04:54:10.933 --> 04:54:12.935
THAT ONE CHANCE TO BE

04:54:13.002 --> 04:54:14.636
SUCCESSFUL IN THIS WORLD A GOOD

04:54:14.703 --> 04:54:16.171
EDUCATION. AND IT'S NOT

04:54:16.238 --> 04:54:18.173
HAPPENING TODAY AND SO THEY

MORATORIUM ON CHARTER SCHOOLS

05:15:49.497 --> 05:15:51.432
NO IT IS NOT WIDE TO MEDIA

05:15:51.499 --> 05:15:53.634
COVERAGE ON THE ISSUE SAYS THAT

05:15:53.701 --> 05:15:55.670
THERE HAS BEEN A TRUCE BETWEEN

05:15:55.736 --> 05:15:58.272

05:16:30.004 --> 05:16:31.739
MENTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE

SENATE THAT WE HAVE THE FIFTH

05:16:32.406 --> 05:16:36.744
LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE WORLD.

05:16:36.811 --> 05:16:37.345
AND ONE THING THAT. WE NEED TO

05:16:37.411 --> 05:16:40.915
DO IF WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN.

05:16:40.981 --> 05:16:45.753
OUR SUCCESS AS A. DEMOCRACY IN

05:16:45.820 --> 05:16:46.654
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

05:16:46.721 --> 05:16:49.223
THRIVE AS A STATE IS HAVING A

05:16:49.290 --> 05:16:53.527
WELL EDUCATED WORK FORCE. I WAS

05:16:53.594 --> 05:16:54.829
VERY PLEASED WITH THE SENATOR

05:16:54.895 --> 05:16:58.165
FROM MERENDA. WHO BROUGHT

05:16:58.232 --> 05:16:59.900
FORWARD A SUBJECT THAT IS

05:16:59.967 --> 05:17:03.104
RARELY TALK ABOUT ON THIS FLOOR.

05:17:03.170 --> 05:17:03.704
AND THAT IS OUR FEELING PUBLIC

05:17:03.771 --> 05:17:07.675
SCHOOL SYSTEM. IN RESPONSE TO

05:17:07.742 --> 05:17:08.209
OUR FAILING PUBLIC SCHOOL

05:17:08.275 --> 05:17:10.911
SYSTEM. WE HAVE HAD A CHARTER

05:17:10.978 --> 05:17:15.149
SCHOOL. MOMENTOUS THIS

05:17:15.216 --> 05:17:18.319
EXPANSION ASPECT HATED I CAN

05:17:18.386 --> 05:17:21.655
TELL YOU IN THE TWENTY SENATE

05:17:21.722 --> 05:17:22.223
DISTRICT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

05:17:22.289 --> 05:17:24.725
CHARTER SCHOOLS WHERE THERE IS.

05:17:24.792 --> 05:17:27.628
FOUR DIGIT. WAITING LISTS FOR

05:17:27.695 --> 05:17:30.664
KIDS TO GET INTO THESE SCHOOLS.

05:17:30.731 --> 05:17:32.500
BECAUSE THEY ARE PERFORM THEIR

05:17:32.566 --> 05:17:37.238
PUBLIC SCHOOL COUNTERPARTS. BY

05:17:37.304 --> 05:17:39.874
A LARGE MAGNITUDE A LOT OF

05:17:39.940 --> 05:17:42.543
THOSE KIDS ARE GRADUATING FROM

05:17:42.610 --> 05:17:45.379
HIGH SCHOOL AND GOING TO FIRST

05:17:45.446 --> 05:17:47.248
CLASS UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES

05:17:47.314 --> 05:17:51.352

05:17:51.419 --> 05:17:52.953
KNOW I'VE MENTIONED ON MORE

05:17:53.020 --> 05:17:53.587

OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED ON A CALL

05:17:58.526 --> 05:18:00.761
OF THE LABOR CAUCUS. I THINK

05:18:00.828 --> 05:18:01.796
IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THE

05:18:01.862 --> 05:18:03.464
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE LABOR

05:18:03.531 --> 05:18:03.964
CAUCUS IS ONE WHO CALLED

05:18:04.031 --> 05:18:06.434
HERSELF LABOR HERSELF. AND I

05:18:06.500 --> 05:18:08.169
THINK IT'S VERY FORTUNATE WHEN

05:18:08.235 --> 05:18:11.138
WE ALLOW. UNIONS TO DICTATE.

05:18:11.205 --> 05:18:12.706
HOW WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUR

05:18:12.773 --> 05:18:13.240
SCHOOL SYSTEMS HERE IN THE

05:18:13.307 --> 05:18:15.342
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE

05:18:15.409 --> 05:18:16.644
CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

05:18:16.710 --> 05:18:18.546
HAS IMMENSE POWER. AND THEY

05:18:18.612 --> 05:18:20.414
LIKE TO EXERT THAT POWER. IN

05:18:20.481 --> 05:18:22.416
ITS WELL OBSERVED ON THE FLOOR

05:18:22.483 --> 05:18:25.753
OF THE SENATE HERE TODAY. AND

05:18:25.820 --> 05:18:26.587
THE U. INFLUENCE OF UNIONS

05:18:28.856 --> 05:18:31.192

05:18:31.258 --> 05:18:33.093
WEEKS OF THE SESSION TO THE

05:18:33.160 --> 05:18:35.296
DETRIMENT. OF SO MANY PEOPLE.

05:18:35.362 --> 05:18:39.099
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF

05:18:39.166 --> 05:18:39.600
WE REALLY CARE ABOUT THE

05:18:39.667 --> 05:18:41.969
QUALITY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE

05:18:42.036 --> 05:18:43.637
SHOULD LEARN SOMETHING BY THE

05:18:43.704 --> 05:18:44.238
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND LEARN WHAT

05:18:44.305 --> 05:18:47.074
THEY'RE DOING RIGHT. AND FIGURE

05:18:47.141 --> 05:18:47.675
OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG IN

05:18:47.741 --> 05:18:50.578
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. MAYBE

05:18:50.644 --> 05:18:52.413
TOO MUCH GERRYMANDERING. BY

05:18:52.480 --> 05:18:53.881
UNIONS LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST

05:18:53.948 --> 05:18:54.582
INTEREST OF TEACHERS AND

05:18:54.648 --> 05:18:57.151
ENSURING THAT THERE'S TENURE

05:18:57.218 --> 05:18:57.785
FOR TEACHERS THAT DON'T DESERVE

05:18:57.852 --> 05:18:58.319
TO BE TEACHING BECAUSE OUR

05:18:58.385 --> 05:19:00.221
LOUSY TEACHERS. NOT TO MENTION

05:19:00.287 --> 05:19:01.355
THE 90% OF TEACHERS THAT ARE

05:19:01.422 --> 05:19:02.990
OUT THERE THEY'RE GREAT THEY'RE

05:19:03.057 --> 05:19:03.824
REALLY WANT TO DO THE JOB MANY

05:19:03.891 --> 05:19:04.992
OF WHOM ARE REPUBLICANS AND

05:19:05.059 --> 05:19:06.660
REALLY. WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE

05:19:06.727 --> 05:19:07.261
OPPORTUNITY TO BE

05:19:07.328 --> 05:19:09.930
UNCONSTRAINED. AND THEY HAVE

05:19:09.997 --> 05:19:10.965
THE ABILITY TO USE OUR TALENTS

05:19:11.031 --> 05:19:14.168
TO TEACH OUR STUDENTS. THE WAY

05:19:14.235 --> 05:19:14.768
I RECEIVED A PUBLIC EDUCATION

05:19:14.835 --> 05:19:16.937
WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL.

05:19:17.004 --> 05:19:18.739
THIS AGAIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

05:19:18.806 --> 05:19:19.607
IS NOTHING MORE THAN ATTACK ON

05:19:19.673 --> 05:19:22.409
CHARTER SCHOOLS. A MAJORITY

05:19:22.476 --> 05:19:22.943
WHICH HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS

05:19:23.010 --> 05:19:23.444
SUCCESS IN THE STATE OF

05:19:23.511 --> 05:19:27.348
CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE REASONS I

05:19:27.414 --> 05:19:28.949

USUALLY READ THE BILLS BUT HERE

05:19:50.838 --> 05:19:51.372
I DON'T NEED TO GO ANY FURTHER

05:19:51.438 --> 05:19:55.042
THAN THE ANALYSIS. CERTAINLY

05:19:55.109 --> 05:19:55.643
VALIDATES THE THINGS I SAID A

05:19:55.709 --> 05:19:58.646
FEW MINUTES AGO. END OF THE

05:19:58.712 --> 05:20:03.717
DIVERT DAYS OF CHARTER SCHOOLSARE ADVOCATES THERE FOR OR FOR.

05:20:03.784 --> 05:20:05.452
WHO SAY THEY BUY INTO THIS. I

05:20:05.519 --> 05:20:08.188
WOULD OFFER SOME ADVICE.

05:20:08.255 --> 05:20:08.822
THEY'LL COME AROUND AND TALK TO

05:20:08.889 --> 05:20:13.961
ME. ELECTED USE HYPOCRITES. IT

05:20:14.028 --> 05:20:18.365
DON'T COMPLAIN. AND ONE OF THE

05:20:18.432 --> 05:20:20.000
ACTIONS AROUND HERE IS STILL A

05:20:20.067 --> 05:20:23.404
MAN AND A BAD DEAL. I CAN

05:20:23.470 --> 05:20:25.739
ENVISION MEETINGS WITH SOME OF

05:20:25.806 --> 05:20:27.508
THESE INDIVIDUALS MORE THEY

05:20:27.575 --> 05:20:30.144
NEGOTIATED TO AMEND THE BILL.

05:20:30.210 --> 05:20:30.711
SO WHAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE

05:20:30.778 --> 05:20:34.415
AMENDMENTS. THE RENEWALS IT

05:20:34.481 --> 05:20:36.150
WOULD BE ALTERED FROM FIVE.

05:20:36.216 --> 05:20:42.122
YEARS TO SEVEN. NOW THAT MEANS.

05:20:42.189 --> 05:20:43.223
FIVE IT DOESN'T MEAN FIVE TO

05:20:43.290 --> 05:20:45.392
SEVEN. THAT IS NOT HOW IT'S

05:20:45.459 --> 05:20:49.830
GONNA WORK OUT. HERE'S ONE THAT

05:20:49.897 --> 05:20:51.198
THEY SHOULD BE HUGELY

05:20:51.265 --> 05:20:51.799
EMBARRASSED IF THEY'VE MADE A

05:20:51.865 --> 05:20:55.936
DEAL. ELIMINATES ACADEMIC

05:20:56.003 --> 05:20:56.770
IMPROVEMENT AS THE MOST

05:20:56.837 --> 05:20:58.706
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN

05:20:58.772 --> 05:21:02.876
REVIEWING A CHARTER SCHOOL.

05:21:02.943 --> 05:21:03.477
THAT IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT

05:21:03.544 --> 05:21:07.247
CONSIDERATION. IF THAT IS NOT

05:21:07.314 --> 05:21:07.815
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHAT IN

05:21:07.881 --> 05:21:13.954
THE WORLD IS. IT ALLOWS THE. OR

05:21:14.021 --> 05:21:14.521
PROHIBITS THE APPROVAL OF A

05:21:14.588 --> 05:21:16.590
PETITION. FOR A NEW NON

TWENTY TWO TO TWO THOUSAND

05:21:29.169 --> 05:21:29.637
TWENTY TWO END QUOTE MOST

05:21:29.703 --> 05:21:32.006
CIRCUMSTANCE. SO NOW WE'RE

05:21:32.072 --> 05:21:35.009
GONNA PUT A CAP THE STOCK.

05:21:35.075 --> 05:21:37.911
BASED ON WHAT EVIDENCE NOW THAT

05:21:37.978 --> 05:21:38.946
MAY HAVE COME UP IN COMMITTEE I

05:21:39.013 --> 05:21:40.948
WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEONE. IN THE

05:21:41.015 --> 05:21:41.548
EDUCATION COMMITTEE HAD ASKED

05:21:41.615 --> 05:21:43.984
THE QUESTION. WHAT DOES THIS DO

05:21:44.051 --> 05:21:47.354
WHAT DOES IT ACCOMPLISH. I'D

05:21:47.421 --> 05:21:49.156
LIKE TO KNOW. THAT I LIKE SOME

05:21:49.223 --> 05:21:50.858
OF THOSE CHARTER FOLKS WHO

05:21:50.924 --> 05:21:51.425
BOUGHT INTO THIS DEAL COMING

05:21:51.492 --> 05:21:54.495
EXPLAINED TO ME. WHAT THIS DOES.

05:21:54.561 --> 05:22:00.601
NO. THIS IS ANOTHER SLIPPERY

05:22:00.668 --> 05:22:01.201
SLOPE NOW THIS IS JUMPING OVER

05:22:01.268 --> 05:22:04.638
THE CLIFF. I CLOSE WITH

05:22:04.705 --> 05:22:07.441

TWO MILLION. IN REVENUE THAT

05:22:49.383 --> 05:22:49.883

PROPORTION OF ANY LARGE SCHOOL

DISTRICT IN THE STATE. A

05:23:06.633 --> 05:23:08.402
SIMILAR FINANCIAL IMPACT WAS

LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT WEST

05:23:12.039 --> 05:23:15.242
CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED. BOTH OF

05:23:15.309 --> 05:23:17.745
THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET A

05:23:17.811 --> 05:23:19.880
VERY SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR

05:23:19.947 --> 05:23:21.815
OUR AREA DOES OF THE LOCAL

05:23:21.882 --> 05:23:23.383
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA BECAUSE

05:23:23.450 --> 05:23:25.786
OF OUR HIGH PERCENT OF CHILDREN

05:23:25.853 --> 05:23:27.888
ON FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH

05:23:27.955 --> 05:23:29.690
CHILDREN WITH ENGLISH AS A

05:23:29.757 --> 05:23:31.058
SECOND LANGUAGE AND A VARIETY

05:23:31.125 --> 05:23:34.061
OF OTHER CRITERIA THAT MAKES

05:23:34.128 --> 05:23:34.595
ONE ELIGIBLE FOR THE LOCAL

05:23:34.661 --> 05:23:37.264
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. NOW

05:23:37.331 --> 05:23:41.835
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. BOTH

05:23:41.902 --> 05:23:44.471
OAKLAND UNIFIED IN WEST CONTRA

05:23:44.538 --> 05:23:46.106
COSTA HAVE BEEN STRUCTURING

05:23:46.173 --> 05:23:48.408
STRUGGLING SIGNAL. WITH THE

05:23:48.475 --> 05:23:52.846
GREAT FINANCIAL BURDEN. NOW

05:23:52.913 --> 05:23:56.283
THEIR COSTS ARE HIGHER WHY.

05:23:56.350 --> 05:23:59.186
BECAUSE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR

05:23:59.253 --> 05:24:00.988
NON CHARTER SCHOOLS AND I

05:24:01.054 --> 05:24:02.489
REALIZE OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

05:24:02.556 --> 05:24:04.091
ALSO PUBLIC BUT ARE NON CHARTER

05:24:04.158 --> 05:24:06.894
SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

05:24:06.960 --> 05:24:08.762
HAVE CREDENTIALED TEACHERS WERE

05:24:08.829 --> 05:24:12.699
ES. MY SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND

05:24:12.766 --> 05:24:15.836
UNIFIED IN WEST CONTRA COSTA

05:24:15.903 --> 05:24:16.403
THEY MUST HAVE CREDENTIALED

05:24:16.470 --> 05:24:20.240
TEACHERS SO. THAT MAY BE ONE OF

05:24:20.307 --> 05:24:23.010
THE REASONS WHY. I'VE YET TO

05:24:23.076 --> 05:24:27.114
FIND A STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATES

05:24:27.181 --> 05:24:29.817
THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE A

05:24:29.883 --> 05:24:32.586
DOCUMENTED BETTER EDUCATION

05:24:32.653 --> 05:24:35.556
THAN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

05:24:35.622 --> 05:24:38.025
I THINK THIS BILL IS NECESSARY

05:24:38.091 --> 05:24:40.761
I'M GLAD THERE WAS NEGOTIATIONS

05:24:40.828 --> 05:24:43.897
THAT CAME TO A PLACE WHERE MORE

05:24:43.964 --> 05:24:44.431
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO GET IN

05:24:44.498 --> 05:24:47.634
SUPPORT. BUT I THINK THAT OUR

05:24:47.701 --> 05:24:50.304
CHILDREN DESERVE TO HAVE

05:24:50.370 --> 05:24:54.007
CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AND- OUR

05:24:54.074 --> 05:24:55.976
TWO SCHOOLS SYSTEMS THAT ARE

05:24:56.043 --> 05:24:58.345
SUPPORTED BY OUR PUBLIC FUNDS

05:24:58.412 --> 05:25:00.647
DESERTED ME HVE TO MEET THE

05:25:00.714 --> 05:25:02.749
SAME STANDARDS AND WITH THAT I

05:25:17.464 --> 05:25:17.931
FRAMEWORK THAT I THINK IS

05:25:17.998 --> 05:25:20.601

CHARTER PRO UNION OR ANTI UNION.

05:25:35.549 --> 05:25:37.551

FINANCIAL BURDEN. IT'S JUST

05:29:50.337 --> 05:29:52.005
SIMPLE TO SAY JUST LIKE I SAID

05:29:52.072 --> 05:29:53.740
WITH WALMART TARGET WALMART CAN

05:29:53.807 --> 05:29:55.308
SAY TARGET NO YOU'RE GONNA

05:29:55.375 --> 05:29:56.776
AFFECT MY FINANCES SO THEREFORE

05:29:56.843 --> 05:29:58.145
YOU CAN'T COME IN. THE PUBLIC

05:29:58.211 --> 05:29:59.246
SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE SCHOOL

05:29:59.312 --> 05:30:00.780
DISTRICT AND SAY YOU'RE GONNA

05:30:00.847 --> 05:30:03.049
AFFECT MY FINANCES SO THEY'RE

05:30:03.116 --> 05:30:03.617
FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN BE

05:30:03.683 --> 05:30:06.753
RENEWED. I JUST ASK YOU TO VOTE

05:30:06.820 --> 05:30:10.357
NO AND THINK ABOUT THE STUDENTS

05:30:10.423 --> 05:30:15.662
THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL.

05:30:15.729 --> 05:30:19.699
SENATOR ALLEN. WELL IT'S TRUE

05:30:19.766 --> 05:30:20.700
THAT IS A SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN

05:30:20.767 --> 05:30:21.434
MAKE A DECISION BASED ON

05:30:21.501 --> 05:30:24.404
FINANCES TO SOME EXTENT BUT YET

05:30:24.471 --> 05:30:25.238
REMEMBER THAT'S WHY THE

05:30:25.305 --> 05:30:26.273
APPROVED AND KEPT THE APPEAL

05:30:26.339 --> 05:30:27.574
RIGHT NOW IS ONE OF THE ISSUES

05:30:27.641 --> 05:30:29.776
I KNOW THAT WAS IT WAS A REAL

05:30:29.843 --> 05:30:32.045
PROBLEM FOR THE C. CSA WHEN THE

05:30:32.112 --> 05:30:32.946
BILL WAS OVER ON THE ASSEMBLY

05:30:33.013 --> 05:30:35.182
SIDE BUT THE FACT IS IF THERE

05:30:35.248 --> 05:30:36.283
IS AN OVERLY POLITICIZED

05:30:36.349 --> 05:30:38.084
DECISION MADE AT THE SCHOOL

05:30:38.151 --> 05:30:39.252
BOARD LEVEL THEY CAN BE

05:30:39.319 --> 05:30:43.023
APPEALED. TO THE COUNTY AND THE

05:30:43.089 --> 05:30:43.957
COUNTY WOULD HAS ABSOLUTE DO

05:30:44.024 --> 05:30:45.492
NOVO REVIEW WHICH MEANS THAT

05:30:45.559 --> 05:30:47.727
THEY CAN LOOK AT THE AT THE

05:30:47.794 --> 05:30:49.863
APPLICATION WITHOUT REGARD FOR

05:30:49.930 --> 05:30:52.332
ANY FINDING MADE BY THE LOCAL

05:30:52.399 --> 05:30:54.267
SCHOOL BOARD AND THEN BY THE

05:30:54.334 --> 05:30:55.569
WAY IF THERE'S ANY ABUSE OF

05:30:55.635 --> 05:30:58.238
DISCRETION IN EITHER OF THE

05:30:58.305 --> 05:30:59.739
LOCAL OR THE COUNTY LEVELS

05:30:59.806 --> 05:31:01.575
THERE'S ALSO APPEAL RIGHTS AT

05:31:01.641 --> 05:31:02.943
THE STATE LEVEL SO THOSE ARE

05:31:03.009 --> 05:31:05.111
ALL AND REALLY IMPORTANT I

05:31:05.178 --> 05:31:06.613
THINK YOU WOULD YOU CREATE

05:31:06.680 --> 05:31:08.281
THESE BOARDS OF DIFFERENT

05:31:08.348 --> 05:31:10.584
EDUCATION POLICYMAKERS. AND WE

05:31:10.650 --> 05:31:13.887
TRUST THEM WITH THE DISCRETION

05:31:13.954 --> 05:31:15.589
TO MAKE DECISIONS A THINKER IN

05:31:15.655 --> 05:31:16.756
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

05:31:16.823 --> 05:31:17.791
STUDENTS IN THAT THEIR

05:31:17.857 --> 05:31:20.126
COMMUNITY SO I HAVE TO SAY I'M

05:31:20.193 --> 05:31:21.661
I THINK THIS IS A STORE

05:31:21.728 --> 05:31:22.729
COMPROMISE THIS IS A BATTLE

05:31:22.796 --> 05:31:24.264
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS

05:31:24.331 --> 05:31:25.465
AND YEARS ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN

05:31:25.532 --> 05:31:27.601
AROUND HERE KNOWS THAT THAT WAS

05:31:27.667 --> 05:31:28.401
ABOUT IT WAS NOT GOING TO GO

05:31:28.468 --> 05:31:30.637
AWAY UNTIL THERE WAS SOME FORM

05:31:30.704 --> 05:31:32.138
OF A DEAL STRUCK AND I ACTUALLY

05:31:32.205 --> 05:31:37.711
THINK THAT THEY STRUCK. THE

05:31:37.777 --> 05:31:38.345
RIGHT BALANCE AND I WILL SAY TO

05:31:38.411 --> 05:31:44.284
MY FRIENDS WERE CONCERNED.

05:31:44.351 --> 05:31:45.051
CHARTER SCHOOLS FIGHT IT THIS

05:31:45.118 --> 05:31:46.086
THIS THIS DEAL DOES A FIRM THAT

05:31:46.152 --> 05:31:47.254
IF YOU ARE. AN EXISTING HIGH

05:31:47.320 --> 05:31:48.822
QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOL THAT IS

05:31:48.888 --> 05:31:49.456
YOU KNOW THAT IS PLAYING BY THE

05:31:49.522 --> 05:31:51.992
RULES YOU ARE HERE TO STAY.

05:31:52.058 --> 05:31:52.626
THAT WAS UP FOR QUESTION BEFORE

05:31:52.692 --> 05:31:53.927
IT ALSO SAYS THAT IT FOR

05:31:53.994 --> 05:31:55.962
EXISTING AND NEW CHARTER

05:31:56.029 --> 05:31:56.563
SCHOOLS A LIKE A DIFFERENCE OF

05:31:56.630 --> 05:31:57.197
CHARTERS ACTUALLY HAVE A REALLY

05:31:57.264 --> 05:31:58.798
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. IN

05:31:58.865 --> 05:32:02.936
CLOSING ARGUMENT GAPS SO I

05:32:03.003 --> 05:32:04.537
THINK DID YOU. DO DID YOU CAN

05:32:04.604 --> 05:32:05.705
NOW THERE'S A BIG DEAL AND

05:32:05.772 --> 05:32:06.973
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN

05:32:07.040 --> 05:32:08.475
THERE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN

05:32:08.541 --> 05:32:11.544
PARSE APART. BUT I THINK WE'VE

05:32:11.611 --> 05:32:13.013
BEEN ABLE TO THREAD A VERY

05:32:13.079 --> 05:32:14.514
DIFFICULT DEAL HERE WITH THE

05:32:14.581 --> 05:32:15.982
STEEL AND I COMMEND THE FOLKS.

05:32:16.049 --> 05:32:16.750
WHO WERE INVOLVED IN IN

05:32:16.816 --> 05:32:19.552
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;RAFTING THIS. I THINK WE'VE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

05:32:19.619 --> 05:32:21.054
WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE STRUCK

05:32:21.121 --> 05:32:22.756
A BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING

05:32:22.822 --> 05:32:24.824
IMPORTANT AMOUNT OF DISCRETION

05:32:24.891 --> 05:32:26.026
TO THE FOLKS THAT WE ENTRUST.

05:32:26.092 --> 05:32:27.627
WITH RUNNING OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM

05:32:27.694 --> 05:32:29.095
BOTH OF THE LOCAL AND COUNTY

05:32:29.162 --> 05:32:30.664
LEVELS WERE ALSO CUT COUNTING

05:32:30.730 --> 05:32:32.198
FOR THE FACT. THAT SOMETIMES

05:32:32.265 --> 05:32:33.099
DECISIONS TO GET OVERLY

05:32:33.166 --> 05:32:34.834
POLITICIZED AND I'M AND IN

05:32:34.901 --> 05:32:37.070
ALLOWING AS A RESULT FOR AND

05:32:37.137 --> 05:32:41.708
PRESERVING. THOSE APPEAL

05:32:41.775 --> 05:32:42.309
RIGHTS. AND WITH THAT I'LL BE

05:32:42.375 --> 05:32:47.514
VOTING AYE. SENATOR BURGESS.

05:32:47.580 --> 05:32:49.449
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THIS

05:32:49.516 --> 05:32:50.417
IS A HOT BUTTON TOPIC IN MY

05:32:50.483 --> 05:32:55.789
HOUSEHOLD. MY MOTHER WAS A LONG

05:32:55.855 --> 05:32:59.426
TERM FACULTY MEMBER IN PUBLIC

05:32:59.492 --> 05:33:02.329
IN AT A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. AND

05:33:02.395 --> 05:33:03.663
I REMEMBER CHATTING WITH HER

05:33:03.730 --> 05:33:06.933
ABOUT THE MERITS OF CHARTER

05:33:07.000 --> 05:33:07.467
SCHOOLS VERSUS TRADITIONAL

05:33:07.534 --> 05:33:11.671
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND. SHE

05:33:11.738 --> 05:33:12.305
BROUGHT UP SOME VERY IMPRESSIVE

05:33:12.372 --> 05:33:16.543
POINTS. AND I DID MY BEST TO

05:33:16.609 --> 05:33:18.411
BRING OUT WHAT I BILL LAW WHAT

05:33:18.478 --> 05:33:19.045
WHAT I BELIEVED WERE IMPRESSIVE

05:33:19.112 --> 05:33:21.348
POINTS AS WELL. AND THEN I

05:33:21.414 --> 05:33:26.753
CAN'T CAME UPON THIS ISSUE OF.

05:33:26.820 --> 05:33:30.957
WHAT IF THE ROLES WERE REVERSED.

05:33:31.024 --> 05:33:32.592
WHAT IF PUBLIC SCHOOLS

05:33:32.659 --> 05:33:35.462
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

05:33:35.528 --> 05:33:35.895
NEEDED TO GO THROUGH

05:33:35.962 --> 05:33:39.933
AUTHORIZATION. THE WAY. THAT WE

05:33:39.999 --> 05:33:42.869
IMPOSED UPON CHARTER SCHOOLS.

05:33:42.936 --> 05:33:46.373
WELL SHOULD INDIVIDUALS WOULD

05:33:46.439 --> 05:33:50.276
CERTAINLY OBJECT TO THAT. AND

05:33:50.343 --> 05:33:50.877
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAD A FIVE

05:33:50.944 --> 05:33:53.413
YEAR PROVE UP PERIOD. IF WE HAD

05:33:53.480 --> 05:33:55.682
A FIVE YEAR PROVE UP PERIOD FOR

05:33:55.749 --> 05:33:58.685
THAT INSTITUTION TO DEMONSTRATE

05:33:58.752 --> 05:34:01.287
ITS ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE. BUT

05:34:01.354 --> 05:34:02.655
WAIT LET'S MAKE IT TWO TO

05:34:02.722 --> 05:34:05.091
SEVEN. HOW WOULD A PUBLIC

05:34:05.158 --> 05:34:07.394
INSTITUTION TO RESPOND TO THAT.

05:34:07.460 --> 05:34:10.296
PROBABLY NOT FAVORABLY HOW

05:34:10.363 --> 05:34:12.632
ABOUT A PUBLIC INSTITUTION THAT

05:34:12.699 --> 05:34:14.467
WOULD BE FORCED TO CLOSE IF IT

05:34:14.534 --> 05:34:16.503
WAS NOT PERFORMING ADEQUATELY

05:34:16.569 --> 05:34:18.705
WITH THAT HAPPENED IN FRESNO

05:34:18.772 --> 05:34:21.341
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY

05:34:21.408 --> 05:34:21.941
NECK OF THE WOODS WHICH IS ONE

05:34:22.008 --> 05:34:23.576
THE LARGEST IN THE STATE OF

05:34:23.643 --> 05:34:24.210
CALIFORNIA. IN THE ANSWER WOULD

05:34:24.277 --> 05:34:25.612
BE NO. THEY WOULD NOT CLOSE

05:34:25.678 --> 05:34:33.753
DOWN. SO THIS IDEA THAT.

05:34:33.820 --> 05:34:35.855
THERE'S A LEVEL PLAYING FEAR

05:34:35.922 --> 05:34:38.091
FIELD BY SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT

05:34:38.158 --> 05:34:39.559
HAVE COMMENTED EARLIER AND ONE

05:34:39.626 --> 05:34:41.895
OF THEM FROM MORE MY ONE OF MY

05:34:41.961 --> 05:34:42.595
FRIENDS FROM SOUTHERN

05:34:42.662 --> 05:34:45.899
CALIFORNIA IS THAT IF YOU WERE

05:34:45.965 --> 05:34:46.533
HIGH PERFORMING YOU ARE HERE TO

05:34:46.599 --> 05:34:48.601
STAY. WOMAN TO THROW THAT RIGHT

05:34:48.668 --> 05:34:51.938
BACK. IF YOU'RE A PUBLIC

05:34:52.005 --> 05:34:53.373
INSTITUTION IN YOUR HIGH

05:34:53.440 --> 05:34:56.843
PERFORMING YOU ARE HERE TO STAY.

05:34:56.910 --> 05:34:58.378
A CHARTER SCHOOL WOULD NOT BE

05:34:58.445 --> 05:35:01.014
NEEDED IF THE SCHOOLS WERE HIGH

05:35:01.080 --> 05:35:03.716
PERFORMING IN HERE TO STAY BUT

05:35:03.783 --> 05:35:04.284
THAT'S JUST ME THAT THAT IS

05:35:04.350 --> 05:35:07.620
JUST NOT THE CASE. AND SO I

05:35:07.687 --> 05:35:08.988
KNOW THAT THIS IS THE SECOND

05:35:09.055 --> 05:35:10.657
TIME OR MORE THAN WE'VE TALKED

05:35:10.723 --> 05:35:12.959
ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND WHAT

05:35:13.026 --> 05:35:15.695
IT MEANS FOR FUTURE. BUT I HAVE

05:35:15.762 --> 05:35:17.330
TWO LITTLE BOYS WERE EIGHT AND

05:35:17.397 --> 05:35:19.732
SIX IN THIS IS KITCHEN. OUR

05:35:19.799 --> 05:35:21.835
DINING TABLE DISCUSSION THAT I

05:35:21.901 --> 05:35:24.270
HAVE WITH MY WIFE ALL THE TIME.

05:35:24.337 --> 05:35:26.072
SHE DOESN'T NECESSARILY CARE

05:35:26.139 --> 05:35:28.274
NOR DO Y. NOR DO MY CHILDREN

05:35:28.341 --> 05:35:31.211
ABOUT FACULTY TENURE. THEY

05:35:31.277 --> 05:35:33.947
DON'T NECESSARILY CARE ABOUT

05:35:34.013 --> 05:35:34.714
THESE OTHER TERMS AND

05:35:34.781 --> 05:35:36.182
CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT WE

05:35:36.249 --> 05:35:39.486
CARE ABOUT. ALL OF THE

05:35:39.552 --> 05:35:40.587
EDUCATION THAT WILL ALLOW THEM

05:35:40.653 --> 05:35:42.989
UPWARD MOBILITY IN A LFESTYLE

05:35:43.056 --> 05:35:46.593
THAT WE'VE TAKEN FOR GRANTED

05:35:46.659 --> 05:35:49.796
HILL. WE ARE NOT BETTER OFF

05:35:49.863 --> 05:35:50.396
THAN OUR PARENTS IS CERTAINLY

05:35:50.463 --> 05:35:50.897
NOT BETTER OFF THAN OUR

05:35:50.964 --> 05:35:54.334
GRANDPARENTS. BUT I LOSE

05:35:54.400 --> 05:35:56.469
PATIENCE WITH THIS IDEA THAT.

05:35:56.536 --> 05:35:58.438
THAT THIS IS LEVELING THE

05:35:58.505 --> 05:36:00.507
PLAYING FIELD. THIS ISN'T

05:36:00.573 --> 05:36:03.109
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD.

05:36:03.176 --> 05:36:05.745
THIS IS FORCIBLY GETTING ONE

05:36:05.812 --> 05:36:09.782
PARTY TO CRY UNCLE. SO WHEN WE

05:36:09.849 --> 05:36:11.551
CALL THIS A COMPROMISE PIECE OF

05:36:11.618 --> 05:36:13.953
LEGISLATION IT MEANS ONE PARTY

05:36:14.020 --> 05:36:15.021
SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE

05:36:15.088 --> 05:36:17.557
POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GO UP

05:36:17.624 --> 05:36:19.392
AGAINST OTHERS AND THEY ARE

05:36:19.459 --> 05:36:22.161
CRYING UNCLE IN WILL RESORT TO

05:36:22.228 --> 05:36:22.629
COMPROMISE TO STATE IN

05:36:22.695 --> 05:36:25.865
EXISTENCE. AND I KNOW THAT WE

05:36:25.932 --> 05:36:27.233
MAY HAVE PHILOSOPHICAL

05:36:27.300 --> 05:36:28.535
DIFFERENT DISAGREEMENTS ON ON

05:36:28.601 --> 05:36:30.970
THIS ISSUE. BUT IF I GO BACK IN

05:36:31.037 --> 05:36:33.273
FLIP THE FLIP THE TABLE ON THIS

05:36:33.339 --> 05:36:35.408
IN OPPOSED TO SAME REQUIREMENTS

05:36:35.475 --> 05:36:36.809
ON TRADITIONAL PUBLIC

05:36:36.876 --> 05:36:38.211
INSTITUTIONS THAT WE HAVE ON

05:36:38.278 --> 05:36:40.480
CHARTER SCHOOLS. THIS WOULD NOT

05:36:40.547 --> 05:36:42.916
EXIST AS A DEBATE TODAY. IT

05:36:42.982 --> 05:36:44.984
WOULD NOT AT ALL AND I WOULD

05:36:45.051 --> 05:36:47.487
ASK MY COLLEAGUES. IF THIS IS

05:36:47.554 --> 05:36:48.621
TRULY ABOUT EDUCATING OUR

05:36:48.688 --> 05:36:52.492
CHILDREN. THEN LET THE MERITS

05:36:52.559 --> 05:36:55.395
OF THIS INDUSTRY SIX FEET. OR

05:36:55.461 --> 05:36:59.599
FAIL ON ON ITS OWN WEIGHT. THAT

05:36:59.666 --> 05:37:01.067
IS THE BEAUTY OF CHARTER

05:37:01.134 --> 05:37:02.135
SCHOOLS THE RIGHTS OR FEEL ON

05:37:02.201 --> 05:37:04.470
THEIR OWN MERITS BUT WE DON'T

05:37:04.537 --> 05:37:05.138
WANT TO GIVE THOSE

05:37:05.204 --> 05:37:07.273
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE

05:37:07.340 --> 05:37:09.676
INSTITUTIONS TO RISE IN THAT IS

05:37:09.742 --> 05:37:10.777
WHERE I HAVE PROBLEMS AS A

05:37:10.843 --> 05:37:14.113
FATHER. AS A PARENT AS A

05:37:14.180 --> 05:37:17.250
HUSBAND IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. I

05:40:38.518 --> 05:40:40.486
THE NUMBERS WERE SO YOU TAKE

05:40:40.553 --> 05:40:43.189
ASSETS LESS LIABILITIES EQUALS

05:40:43.256 --> 05:40:44.423
THE NET ASSETS ARE OWNERS

05:40:44.490 --> 05:40:46.559

05:40:50.696 --> 05:40:52.832
THAT NET ASSET IN YOUR REDUCE

05:40:52.899 --> 05:41:02.141
IT BY A MONEY. I'M OUT THAT

05:41:02.208 --> 05:41:04.343
THAT IS YOURS THAT SHOWS THAT

05:41:04.410 --> 05:41:04.911
YOU HAVE SOME NETWORK SOME

05:41:04.977 --> 05:41:09.715
pNUMBERS ARE STAGGERING WHEN WE

05:41:09.782 --> 05:41:11.017
ADDED ALL NINE HUNDRED AND

05:41:11.083 --> 05:41:15.021
FORTY. THE NUMBER FOR THE NET

05:41:15.087 --> 05:41:18.191
UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT. WAS

05:41:18.257 --> 05:41:23.062
FIFTY POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS.

05:41:23.129 --> 05:41:24.964
WE DID IT AGAIN THIS YEAR ADD

05:41:25.031 --> 05:41:27.567
IT ALL UP FOR THE- SCHOOL

05:41:27.633 --> 05:41:28.434
DISTRICTS ALL NINE HUNDRED AND

05:41:28.501 --> 05:41:32.538
FORTY. AND THE NUMBER WAS

05:41:32.605 --> 05:41:33.873
SEVENTY POINT EIGHT BILLION IT

UNRESTRICTED. ASSETS OF ZERO OR

05:41:45.051 --> 05:41:49.522
HIGHER JUST 10% SO I THINK WE

05:41:49.589 --> 05:41:50.756
NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ON

05:41:50.823 --> 05:41:52.425

DIFFERENT CONCLUSION SO FAR.

05:42:16.716 --> 05:42:18.818
