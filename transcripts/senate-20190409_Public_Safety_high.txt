WE DO NOT OF A QUORUM YET SO WE WILL NOT CALL THE ROLL YET -- IN ON LET ME ANNOUNCE IF YOU I'M CHANGES ON THE AGENDA -- THERE ARE TWO BILLS THAT ARE COLD THERE ARE. TWO BILLS PULLED FROM TODAY'S AGENDA SO WE WILL NOT BE HEARING THEM AND THOSE ARE SB -- SIX NINETY FOUR MR STONE -- RATHER SENATORS KNOWN. AND SB -- FIVE CAN SENATOR JONES AND ADDITIONALLY. SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE BY SENATOR DORADO IS NOW ADDED TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR SO WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR SB. TWO THIRTY NINE SB. TWO FIFTY SEVEN SB TWO FIFTY NINE SB THREE NINETY NINE SB FOUR SEVENTY ONE AND DEATH. SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE ALL RIGHT SO WITH THAT -- WE WILL START WITH THE FIRST BILL PRESENTATION SENATOR BATES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR IN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL ONE FORTY ONE IT ENSURES THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BY REQUIRING THAT ALL INMATES CONVICTED OF A SEXUALLY VIOLENT OFFENSE. BE ADMINISTERED A RISK ASSESSMENT BEFORE RELEASE I AM HAPPY ARE CERTAINLY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO CREATE THE BEST POSSIBLE POLICY. AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TODAY IN A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THE HARD WORK OF STAFF THAT WORKED WITH MINE. TO BRING US HERE TODAY. CURRENTLY BEFORE THEY ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON INMATES SENTENCED TO A DETERMINATE TERM FOR A SEXUALLY VIOLENT OFFENSE ARE EVALUATED. FOR POTENTIAL MENTAL DISORDERS WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE ARE ACCEPTING FROM THE COMMITTEE SB ONE FORTY ONE WILL ENSURE THAT ARE SIMILAR EVALUATION IS A MINISTER TO INMATES WITH. INDETERMINATE OR LIFE SENTENCES FOR SEXUALLY VIOLENT CRIMES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE. THIS WILL GUARANTEE THAT INMATES WHO HAVE A PRIOR SEXUALLY VIOLENT OFFENSE ARE ASSESSED DURING THE PAROLE BOARD HERING PROCESS FOR THEIR POTENTIAL RISK TO RE OFFEND. THIS DOES NOT CREATE A NEW DUPLICATIVE PROCESS OUTSIDE OF AN INMATE'S PAROLE BOARD HEARING. BUT INTO REYES A NECESSARY SAFEGUARD INTO THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK. THE CASE IS THAT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY ARE NOT LARGE NUMBER. BUT THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS SEXUAL OFFENDERS IN OUR PRISONS AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MENTALLY STABLE. BEFORE THEY'RE RELEASED INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE THE BILL SPONSORED BY THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND JOINING ME FROM HER OFFICE THIS MORNING.

SOME OF THE MOST VIOLENT OFFENDERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN STATE PRISON THEY CAN BE ASSESSED FOR A RISK ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY FOR SEX OFFENDERS AND WITH THE LEGISLATION WOULD DO. IS IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PAROLE BOARD TO CONSIDER THE RESULTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE. VALIDATED RISK ASSESSMENT FOR SEX OFFENDERS AND WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED -- WHEN THE BOARD DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT THOSE TYPE THE FENDERS SHOULD BE GRANTED PAROLE? AND WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR BATES FOR FOR CARRYING THE BILL AND HER STAFF AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE I WOULD HAVE REGARDING SB.

AND MISTER MOORE LIKE DOESN'T HAVE A BILL. YES THE OFFICE IS ON HIS WAY OKAY THEN WE WILL HOLD OFF -- TO OKAY THAT'S GOOD. RIGHT. SO WE ARE WAITING SOME AUTHORS THERE ARE GOING TO PROCEED THIS IS THE BETTER. IN MY WITNESSES ARE ON THEIR WAY THEY SHOULD BE HERE THIS IS ITEM FIFTEEN SB. FIVE FORTY FIVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HELL SB. FIVE FORTY FIVE WILL REQUIRE A STATEWIDE PILOT PROGRAM FOR FIRST TIME DO YOU WHY OFFENDERS TO INSTALL AN IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE. THE COMMITTEE AND A FULL SENATE UNANIMOUSLY. APPROVED AN IDENTICAL BILL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SB. TEN FORTY SIX ONCE EVERY TWO MINUTES A PERSON IS INJURED IN A DRUNK DRIVING CRASH IN THE UNITED STATES. ONCE EVERY HOUR SOMEONE DIES FROM A DRUNK DRIVER. IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR OVER ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE FROM DRUNK DRIVERS. AND MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND ARE INJURED. SB FIVE FORTY FIVE TAKE SWIFT ACTION. TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM DRUNK DRIVERS. OVER HALF OF DIY OFFENDERS DRIVE ILLEGALLY AFTER THEIR ARREST OR DID NOT COMPLETE TREATMENT PROGRAMS. IN REPEAT DO YOU WHY OFFENDERS KEEP RE OFFENDING THE ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT ONE THIRD OF ANNUAL DO YOU AYE CONVICTIONS. A REPORT RELEASED BY MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING FOUND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX IGNITION INTERLOCK STOPPED A DRUNK DRIVER NEARLY TWO POINT SIX NINE MILLION TIMES NATIONALLY. THIRTY THREE STATES HAVE ALREADY ENACTED THIS THIRTY THREE STATES HAVE ALREADY ENACTED LAWS MANDATING AYE ID'S FOR FIRST TIME OFFENDERS. I HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DRUNK DRIVING DEATHS. NEW MEXICO'S INTERLOCK LAW WAS IMPLEMENTED. DRUNK DRIVING FATALITIES ARE DOWN BY 38%. IN ARIZONA IN LOUISIANA. DRUNK DRIVING DEATHS HAVE DECREASED BY FORTY THREE AND 35% RESPECTIVELY AS A RESULT OF THIS LAW. IN OREGON DO YOU AYE DEATHS ARE DOWN 42% 42% IN OREGON IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL NINETY ONE WITH NEARLY UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THE BILL CREATED A FOR COUNTY PILOT PROGRAM IN THE COUNTIES OF LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO ALAMEDA AND TO LAURIE REQUIRING AYE ID'S FOR ALL DO YOU WHY OFFENDERS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE SENATE BILL TEN FORTY SIX WAS INTRODUCED TO EXPAND THE PILOT PROGRAM AYE ID'S REQUIREMENT FOR ALL THE U. I. OFFENDERS STATEWIDE. THOUGH IT HAD RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE. AN AMENDMENT TO SB TEN FORTY SIX AT THE LAST MINUTE. MAID ID'S FOR FIRST OFFENDERS OPTIONAL INSTEAD OF MANDATORY. WHICH IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL PILOT PROJECT. THE RESULT IS THAT THE STATE WIDE PILOT PROGRAM NOW DIFFERS FROM THE LOCAL PILOT IT WAS MEANT TO EXTEND. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE PASSING ALL OFFENDER AYE ID LAW CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL PILOT PROGRAM. SO WE CAN APPROPRIATELY ASSESS THE STATEWIDE IMPACT. SOME WILL SAY DO YOU AYE PENALTIES ARE TOO EXCESSIVE. THROUGHOUT MY CAREER HAVE I HAVE WORKED TO REDUCE TRAFFIC PENALTIES AND BRING FAIRNESS TOWARD JUSTICE SYSTEM I ALSO LOOK FORWARD IN SUPPORTING SB ONE FORTY FOUR THIS YEAR. TO FURTHER REDUCE CRIMINAL FINES. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND SAID STAKEHOLDERS TO REDUCE EXISTING PENALTIES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DO YOU EYES. SB FIVE FORTY FIVE DOES NOT INCREASE ANY EXISTING PENALTIES FOR DO YOU AYE OFFENSES. MY INTENT IS NOT TO EXCESSIVELY PENALIZED IN FACT I WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO EVERYDAY LIFE MORE QUICKLY AND DO SO SAFELY. THE BILL OFFERS EXTENSIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OPTION THE SYSTEMS OPTIONS TO ENSURE ID'S ARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL OFFENDERS. THERE IS EVEN AN EARLY CREDIT OPTION IN THE BILL. WE'RE IF AN OFFENDER INSTALLS AND ID EARLY THEIR SIX MONTH CLOCK STARTS OFFENDERS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DMV OR THE COURTS. THEY CAN PROACTIVELY INSTALL THE ID START THEIR SIX MONTH CLOCK AND GET ON WITH THEIR LIFE. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONTINUE THEIR LIVES AND NOT BE FORCED INTO SUSPENDED LICENSES OR LIMITED DRIVING PRIVILEGES. IT WILL ALSO ENSURE ALL DO YOU WHY OFFENDERS DO NOT DRIVE DRUNK. SB FIVE FORTY FIVE IS AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH THAT WILL KEEP OUR ROADS SAFE. BUT DON'T JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD SUPPORTS MY LEGISLATION STATING MISSION INTERLOCK DEVICES ARE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM. AMONG D. W. I. OFFENDERS SOMETIMES BY AS MUCH AS 62275%. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION HAS COLON STATES TO IMPLEMENT MANDATORY I ID LAWS FOR FIRST TIME OFFENDERS STATING THAT. THAT ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING DECREASES BY AN AVERAGE OF 6367%. THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE OF HIGHWAY SAFETY FOUND THAT STATES THAT IMPLEMENTED LAWS LIKE SB FIVE FORTY FIVE SO DRUNK DRIVING DEATHS DECREASED. BY 16% BOTTOM LINE COLLEAGUES ID'S PREVENT DRUNK DRIVING AND SAVE LIVES. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN HERE JUST -- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IN THE MERRY I WILL LET YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND AND THAT'S RIGHT. QUALITY SENATOR -- BUT WE JUST ESTABLISHED A CORNER WOULD LIKE TO CALL THE ROLL BEFORE YOU START YOUR TESTIMONY OKAY THANK YOU MATTER. SKINNER -- HERE SKINNER HERE MORE LOCK. WELL OUT HERE BRADFORD. FOR HERE JACKSON HERE JACKSON HERE MITCHELL MORALE WIENER. NOW YOU CAN CONTINUE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN SKINNER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MERRY CLASS BACH ON THE LIVERMORE RESIDENT AND THE NURSE AT JOHN MUIR MEDICAL CENTER AND WALNUT CREEK COUNTY CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY NINE PLUS YEARS. I'M A FORMER NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER OF MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE MATTHEW CLASS BALK MANDATORY IGNITION INTERLOCK THE U. I. OFFENDER ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SB. FIVE FOUR FIVE FIVE FORTY FIVE I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS WAS A LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE ALL FIRST TIME DO YOU WHY OFFENDERS TO INSTALL AN IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE. THE LEGISLATION IS VERY PERSONAL. MY SON IS MATTHEW CLASS BACH. HE IS GONE BECAUSE A CONVICTED DRUNK DRIVER. CHOSE TO DRINK AND DRIVE. THIS TIME ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE MEANT TO KEEP HIM OFF THE HIGHWAYS. IN ADDITION INTERLOCKED Là LIKE SB FIVE FORTY FIVE WOULD HAVE SAVED MY SON'S LIFE. EVERY DRUNK DRIVING DEATH IN CALIFORNIA IN ANYWHERE IS PREVENTABLE. THE FACT COMPOUNDS THE GRIEF MY FAMILY AND I LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES. MATT'S DEATH WAS A 100% PREVENTABLE. MATTHEW WAS A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD MIDSHIPMAN AT THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY. WE WERE SO PROUD TO SEE HIM PURSUE HIS LIFELONG DREAM OF BECOMING A PILOT. HE CONSISTENTLY MADE THE DEAN'S LIST. HE WAS THE FIRST SERGEANT OF HIS COMPANY AND HIS SECOND CLASS YEAR AND HE WAS ENGAGED FOR ONE WEEK. HE WAS KILLED BEFORE REALIZING HIS DREAM. YOU DON'T FORGET THE NIGHT THAT CHANGES YOUR LIFE FOREVER. I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY THE NIGHT OF JULY TWENTY NINTH. TWO THOUSAND ONE MATT WAS WOMAN SUMMER BREAK. A DRUNK DRIVER RAN A STOP SIGN. SLAMMING INTO THE CAR THAT MATT MY HUSBAND TOM AND I WERE IN. THE IMPACT FORCE US OVER A THREE FOOT CONCRETE CONCRETE AREA BARRIER. WHERE WE WERE HIT BY AN ONCOMING PICKUP TRUCKS? TRAPPED IN THE CAR AN INJURED MYSELF. I TRIED TO GET TO MY SON TO START CPR. BUT I COULD NOT. AS A NURSE AT A TRAUMA CENTER. FOR TWENTY NINE PLUS YEARS I HAVE NEVER FELT SO HELPLESS. WHEN I HEARD AN EMT SAY THIS ONE HAS NO PULSE I KNEW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MATT? I SHARE MY STORY TODAY NOT FOR PITY. BUT TO MOTIVATE LAWMAKERS TO MAKE THIS STOP. MATT WHO WAS PREPARED TO RISK HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD DIED RIGHT HERE ON CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY. IT IS MATT IT IS EN MASSE HONORED THAT I HAVE WALKED THE HALLS OF THIS CAPITAL FOR TWELVE YEARS TO SAVE OTHER FAMILIES. FROM THE EXPERIENCING THE GRIEF THAT MY FAMILY HAS EXPERIENCE. IN HIS OWN WAY. MATT IS SERVING OUR COUNTRY JUST NOT LIKE HERE WE PLANNED. WE KNOW THAT LICENSE SUSPENSION ALONE IS NOT EFFECTIVE. WE CAN'T JUST TAKE AWAY DRIVING PRIVILEGES AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. WE KNOW THAT UP 275% OF OFFENDERS CONTINUE TO DRIVE ON SUSPENDED LICENSES. AND BY THE WAY. MOST OF THOSE DRIVERS ARE DRIVING WITHOUT INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE INSURANCE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A LICENSE. IN ADDITION INTERLOCK USERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE INSURANCE. IGNITION INTERLOCK STOP THE REVOLVING DOOR OF REPEAT DRUNK DRIVING. A STUDY CONDUCTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA DMV FOUND THAT IGNITION INTERLOCK ARE 74% MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE U. I. OFFENSES THAN LICENSE SUSPENSION ALONE. SB FIVE FORTY FIVE MATTHEWS LAW WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL DRUNK DRIVERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE SOBRE TO USE SICKNESS IGNITION AND LOCKS IT GIVES DRUNK DRIVERS THE OPPORTUNITY GET BACK TO THEIR DAILY LIFE. TO GO BACK TO WORK TO PICK UP THEIR CHILDREN TO ATTEND DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS TO ATTEND TREATMENT. AS LONG AS THEY FIRST PROVIDE A SOBRE BREATH. AS A NURSE AT A BAY AREA TRUCK MAGNET HOSPITALS I UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE LIVES. IT IS NO DIFFERENT HERE. WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT THE ACCURACY OF TODAY'S IGNITION INTERLOCK TECHNO KNOWLEDGE HE HAS ADVANCED TREMENDOUSLY? OVER THE PAST DECADE AID VIRTUALLY ELIMINATING THE CHANCE OF CERTAIN FOODS AND CERTAIN DRINKS ARE TO BACK HOLE WILL TRIGGER A FOST POT FALSE POSITIVE. IN CALIFORNIA EVERY ADDITION INTERLOCK MANUFACTURERS REQUIRED TO USE FUEL CELL SENSORS WHEN DETECTING ALCOHOL LOW LEVELS IN IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES SIMPLY PUT. THE FUEL CELL UNLIKE THE OLD SEMI CONDUCTOR SENSOR ONLY READS ALCOHOL. IT IS THE SAME TECHNOLOGY USED BY BREATHALYZER BUT THAT THE CHP AND ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TIMES AND FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS EACH YEAR. THE RELIABILITY OF THE LIFESAVING POTENTIAL OF IGNITION INTERLOCK IS THE REASON WIDESPREAD USE OF IT INTERLOCKS IS RIMAC RECOMMENDED BY EVERY HIGHWAY SAFETY ORGANIZATION. AS WELL AS THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND VARIOUS TRAFFIC TRAFFIC SAFETY GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY I ASK YOU TO PLEASE VOTE YES ON MATTHEWS LAW. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR TO PASS A COMMONSENSE LAW THAT WILL STOP THE HORRIFIC 100% PREVENTABLE TRAZ STRATEGIES BECAUSE BY DRUNK DRIVING THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE HAVE A SECOND WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN SKINNER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEO AUTONOMOUS SAFETY ADVOCATE FOR THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD. THE NTSB IS AN INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCY CHARGED BY CONGRESS TO INVESTIGATE TRAFFIC CRASHES DETERMINE THE PROBABLE CAUSES AN ISSUE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE SAFETY. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB. FIVE FOUR FIVE MATTHEW CLASS BACK MANDATORY IGNITION INTERLOCK FOR DIY OFFENDER ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG IMPAIRMENT IS ON THE N. T. S. B.'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY MOST WANTED LIST OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE NTSB RELEASED A STUDY REACHING ZERO ACTIONS TO ELIMINATE ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING. WE RECOMMENDED A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF NINETEEN TARGETED INTERVENTIONS. NTSB TOOK A BOLD FRESH LOOK AT THIS ISSUE IN AN EFFORT TO HIM AND IMPAIR DRIVING. THE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED REQUIRING A MANDATORY USE OF IGNITION INTERLOCK FOR ALL OFFENDERS CONVICTED OF IMPAIRED DRIVING. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FIRST TIME OFFENDERS COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF D. W. I. CONVICTIONS. BUT BY THE TIME THEY'RE CONVICTED THE SO FOR SO CALLED FIRST OFFENDERS HAVE DRIVE IN HAVE DRIVEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL EIGHTY TIMES. INTERVENTION HAS TO START EARLY ON THE FIRST CONVICTION. THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUFFOLK SUBSEQUENT OFFENSES REDUCE CRASHES AND SAVE LIVES. IGNITION INTERLOCK FOR ALL OFFENDERS PROVIDE A SWIFT AND CERTAIN PUNISHMENT FOR CONVICTED IMPAIRED DRIVERS. ONCE INSTALLED IGNITION INTERLOCK STOOD HER IMPAIRED DRIVERS FROM GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL AND ENDANGERING THEMSELVES AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD. RESEARCH OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES HAS FOUND THAT IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES ARE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM AMONG DO YOU AYE AND DWI OFFENDERS SOMETIMES BY AS MUCH AS 62275%. ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE. IF ALL DRIVERS WITH AT LEAST ONE ALCOHOL AND DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVING CONVICTION WITHIN THE LAST THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THEIR CRASH HAD USED A ZERO B. AC IGNITION INTERLOCK. APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DEATHS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IN ONE YEAR. MOST AMERICANS THINK THAT WE HAVE SOLVED THE DRUNK DRIVING PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY THE FACT IS WE HAVE NOT. TO THE CONTRACT COULD TO THE CONTRARY APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND OR ONE THIRD OF ALL HIGHWAY DEATHS INVOLVE IMPAIR DRIVING. AND THAT NUMBER HAS REMAINED STUBBORNLY CONSTANT FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND LOST LIVES IN PREVENTABLE CRASHES. BASED ON THE LACK OF PROGRESS REDUCING ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. IT IS CLEAR THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PUT AN END TO THESE PREVENTABLE TRAGEDIES. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT IGNITION IGNITION INTERLOCK TECHNOLOGY CAN AND SHOULD BE EMBRACED IN THIS BATTLE AT EVERY LEVEL AND THIS IS WHY NTSB SUPPORTS SB. FIVE FOUR FIVE THERE IS NO ARGUMENT THAT ADDRESSING THIS LEADING KILLER ON AMERICANS ROADS AMERICA'S ROADS REQUIRES A BOLD MULTI FACETED APPROACH THAT INCLUDES PREVENTING PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED IMPAIRED DRIVERS. FROM STARTING AND OPERATING pCONSUMED A MEASURABLE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL. ALLOWING A SECOND CHANCE COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. THE NTSB URGES CALIFORNIA TO STRENGTHEN ITS ADMISSION INTERLOCK Là. THOUSANDS OF LIVES WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR ACTION I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND WHILE THOSE WITNESSES COME TO MIKE I'M GOING TO HAND THE GAVEL TO MY VOICE. AND A LACK I HAVE TO DEPART THE COMMITTEE FOR A LITTLE BIT FIVE THE HEARING WILL CONTINUE THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS RAINY PERRY ON BEHALF OF PORAC AND WE SUPPORT PEOPLE GETTING THEIR LIVES BACK EARLY THANK YOU. JOHNSON CLAIMED TO HAVE THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO ALSO IN SUPPORT. AMY BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM AT THE TABLE. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN RESIGNATION HERNANDEZ SOME HALF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION COMPLUTENSE ATTORNEYS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE ALSO WORKING PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICE WE ARE OPPOSED. TO THE BILL. A FEW THINGS BACKGROUND -- CENTER HILL AND I HAVE BEEN IN THIS POSITION BEFORE I THINK FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO WE HAVE -- BEEN DISCUSSING THE WIFE OUR PUBLIC POLICY HOW TO HANDLE IT IN PARTICULAR ANALOG DEVICES SO THERE'S BEEN AN ONGOING DISCUSSION AND DEBATE -- CERTAINLY WE'RE DEALING WITH SOME VERY SERIOUS ISSUES -- SOME VERY SERIOUS TRAGEDIES -- THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY -- REGRETFUL. THAT BEING SAID WHAT WE HAVE -- NEGOTIATING DISCUSSED OVER THE YEARS -- WAS SENT TO THE PILOT PROJECT -- AND ONE PIECE OF THE PILOT PROJECT WAS IN FACT A STUDY. A AND AS THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS POINTS OUT. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT PROJECT THE THE MANDATORY USE OF IRAQ OF ICE ON FIRST OFFENSES DID NOT HAVE A STATISTICAL IMPACT. ON INCREASE OR DECREASE OF REPEAT AND D. Y. FENCES IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY OR BELIEVE MY MY BEEN REFERENCING CRASHES SO. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY KEY IN FACT WE HAD I DO REMEMBER HAVING TESTIMONY IN COMMITTEE WHEN WE WERE WAITING FOR THE REPORT HOW WE PUSH BACK A BILL WAITING FOR THE REPORT -- BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE -- WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS GOING TO BE IN THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT A MANDATORY A LOCK IN A FIRST OFFENSE -- DID NOT HAVE THE IF THE DESIRED EFFECT AS I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND THE OTHER THING AND I'M GLAD -- THE PROPONENTS MENTION OREGON. ONE THING THAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING OVER THESE YEARS AND SOMETIMES I GET CRITICIZED FOR AND I TAKE THE CRITICISM. BUT DO YOU EYES AND ALCOHOLISM. REQUIRES A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH IS PROPONENTS INDICATED. IN CALIFORNIA CLOSE 250% OF ARRESTS FOR THE WISE OR NOT THE DRIVERS WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR SO IS A FULL. YOU KNOW FULL SPECTRUM APPROACH WE WANT TO REDUCE DEVICE WE NEED MORE FUNDING FOR ALCOHOL PROGRAMS IN THESE COMMUNITIES CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CULTURALLY RELEVANT -- THE TALK ABOUT OREGON ORGANS CITIZENS ARE VERY INTERESTING THEY ALSO HAVE A DO YOU AYE DIVERSION PROGRAM. IN OREGON WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS ALSO AN IDEA THAT I KNOW SENATOR HILL. AND I HAVE IT'S COME UP DURING OUR DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES AND PRIOR BILLS. SO THEY'RE TAKING A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH I'M ALL. FOR LET'S LOOK AT THE REAL PROBLEM LET'S LOOK AT TRYING TO REDUCE ALCOHOLISM REDUCE ALCOHOL RELATED INCIDENTS WERE ALL FOR THAT. MANDATORY ANALOG DEVICES ACCORDING TO THE THE STUDY DIDN'T WORK HERE. WE SHOULD MOVE FOR THE OTHER THING ABOUT THE STATEWIDE PILOT -- THAT WAS TESTED OUT THAT AMEND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT THAT AMENDMENT HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY WERE YEARS OF DEBATE ON-WHETHER OR NOT A MANDATORY. INTERLOCK DEVICE SHOULD BE USED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WHAT WE FOUND IN STUDIES IS THAT WHEN IT IS AN OPTION. WHEN IS INCENTIVIZE TO INSTALL INTERLOCK DEVICE IT IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE? THEN IF IT'S IF IT'S MADE MANDATORY THE LAST THING I'LL MENTION THIS WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FOR ATTORNEYS IN FROM THEIR CLIENTS. THAT DESPITE THE WELL THE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS OF CENTER HILL ON THE PRIOR BILLS AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE INTERLOCK DEVICES ARE AFFORDABLE AND THERE'S A SLIDING SCALE. THE REALITY IS IN STATISTICS BEAR IT OUT AND STUDY BEARS IT OUT. THAT COMPLIANCE IS RELATIVELY LOW BECAUSE DRIVERS CANNOT AFFORD IT. AND COMPANIES ARE STILL NOT PROVIDING A WAY TO PAY FOR IT MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AND EVEN. EVEN LOOKING AT PAYMENT PLANS WE END UP WITH DRIVERS WHO MAY NOT OWE MONEY TO THE COURT OR WILL THEY STILL OWE MONEY THE CORPORATE ALSO -- MONEY TO THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES TO INSTALL THE INTERLOCK DEVICES SO THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL AND CENTER HILLS ARE SENSITIVE TO THAT HAS WE HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT BUT THEN THIS BILL IN THE FOR THE PRIOR BILL SO. IT'S NOT THIS BILL IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT APPEARS ON ON THE SURFACE YES WE WANT TO REDUCE THE Y. OFFENSES ABSOLUTELY WE WANT TO REDUCED U. I. TRAGEDIES ABSOLUTELY BUT WE'VE HAD THIS DEBATE FOR NUMBER OF YEARS. WE SETTLED ON A CERTAIN APPROACH AND AGREED ON A CERTAIN APPROACH. AND THIS CHANGES THAT APPROACH -- THAT IS AND IT IS CONTRARY TO WHAT THE STUDY SHOWS THAT WE COMMISSION HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR THOSE REASONS REPOSE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. YOU MISTER HERNANDEZ MISS CALLED. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION MISTER AND THEN THIS IS THE PRETTY MUCH TOUCHED ALL THE POINTS THAT I WOULD -- TOUCH ON AND HAS MUCH MORE THE HISTORY THEN I DO PERSONALLY HOWEVER -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT. I TO IN MY ORGANIZATION WE ARE DEEPLY SADDENED BY THE DEATH AND THE INJURIES THAT PEOPLE SUFFER. DUE TO DRUNK DRIVING. AND I AGREE WITH THE SPEAKER FROMTHE NTSB THAT INTERVENTION MUST START EARLY. EARLY IS NOT AFTER SOMEONE HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF A G. A D. Y. EARLY AS LONG BEFORE THAT WE NEED THE MONEY TO GO TO EDUCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. FOR TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO FCUS NOT ON HAVING SOMEONE PUT IN A VERY EXPENSIVE INTO THEIR CAR A LOT OF THE OUR CLIENTS AS PUBLIC DEFENDERS DON'T EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN CAR. THEY'RE DRIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR. SO THIS REQUIREMENT OF THE INTERLOCK UP WILL NOT MAKE A CHANGE FOR THEM SECONDLY. DRUNK DRIVING OFFENSES THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN FINES AND FEES AND AND INSURANCE IF YOU GO GET IT AND ALL THESE THINGS -- AND A LAWYER IF YOU CAN AFFORD A LAWYER BUT MOST CANNOT MOST COME TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. THOSE CLIENTS OF MINE HAVE TO DO-COMMUNITY SERVICE TO PAY FOR THEIR PHONE LINES THEY UP SOMETIMES GET CREDIT FOR MANY MANY DAYS IN JAIL THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN. INCARCERATED BUT THEY GET THAT CREDIT AGAINST THEIR PHONE LINES SO EVEN IF THEY'RE ONLY REQUIRED TO PAY 10%. OF THE COST OF THE INTERLOCK DEVICE. THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT JUST LIKE A MISTER LANDER SAID THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE REFERRAL TO MANY OF THE STUDIES -- DUE RESPECT TO THE SPEAKERS AND TO THE SENATOR MANY OF THESE STUDIES REFERRED TO DON'T JUST LOOK AT FIRST TIME DO YOU -- LIKE SO YOU CANNOT RELY ON THOSE STATISTICS. TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT FIRST TIME DO YOU WHY. I'VE. BEEN IN CRIMINAL DEFENSE FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS I HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF FIRST TIME. DRUNK DRIVERS AND I HAVE NOT. VERY OFTEN SEEN THEM COME BACK THE FIRST TIME DRUNK DRIVERS I OFTEN FEEL LIKE. ALMOST ANYBODY COULD GET. THEIR FIRST TIME DRUNK DRIVERS DRIVING OFFENSE -- AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT TO SAY BUT I HAD THIS IS WHAT I'VE SEEN WITH MY FRIENDS. MY OWN FAMILY -- AND MY CLIENTS. IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT GO ON TO THEIR SECOND THAT REALLY NEED THE HELP AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEED. THE TREATMENT THE EDUCATION AND THE ANALOG DEVICES NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT -- OFTEN I AM AN ALLIANCE WITH THE COURTS DECISIONS WHEN THEY'RE EXERCISING THEIR DISCRETION -- BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TAKE THAT DISCRETION AWAY FROM THE COURTS. IF ANYTHING THEY ARE VERY VERY SERIOUS ABOUT. DO YOU AYE CASES AND IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS DEVICE IS APPROPRIATE FOR FIRST TIME DRUNK DRIVING. OFFENDERS THEY WILL IMPOSE THIS CONDITION AND I ASK YOU NOT TO TAKE THAT DISCRETION AWAY FROM THE COURT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS CALDWELL ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES SENATOR JACKSON'S. THANK YOU. AND FIRST I WANT TO EXTEND MY CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES WHO ARE HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST. LOVED ONES TO DRUNK DRIVING. OF I I CAN I I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO KNOW BUT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. AND CERTAINLY -- WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO EDUCATE AND PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING SO UNNECESSARY AND YET SO DEVASTATING SO. ARE THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH I'M COMING SO I'M -- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE N. T. AS A PERSON AS WELL AS THE THE DEFENSE SIDE OF THIS IF. IF I COULD -- OF A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY IS IN CHARGE OF DRUNK DRIVING IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE. DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EVEN MEDICATIONS. OF THAT FOR PEOPLE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS CANNABIS -- GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE IN THE MARKET TODAY I CAN'T KEEP TRACK BUT IS. IS YOUR RESEARCH YOUR STUDIES INDICATE THAT THESE ARE EQUALLY AS MUCH PROBLEM AND THAT THIS DEVICE WILL. AFFECT THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER INTOXICANTS OUT WILL BE PRECLUDED FROM DRIVING A CAR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. I'M THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AROUND DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVING IS NOT ACCURATE BECAUSE THE REPORTING IS INCONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE. HOWEVER WE DO KNOW ANECDOTALLY THAT IT IS ON THE RISE -- BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE HARD NUMBERS TO SAY THAT THIS IS EQUAL TO ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING WE DO HAVE THE HARD NUMBERS FOR ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING. AND THAT IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN OF FATALITIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR ANY AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL IN THE SYSTEM. IN ANY AMOUNT MEANING YOU COULD HAVE A POINT NO ONE YET POINTA ONE ALL THE WAY UP ONE THOUSAND HREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN FATALITIES IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE IT APPOINT A ONE THESE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING IMPAIRED. ALTHOUGH -- EXCUSE ME IMPAIRMENT BEGINS AT THE FIRST RANK. IT BEGINS WELL I I KNOW THAT I I STARTED MY CAREER AS A PROSECUTOR AND AT WHEN THE BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL -- ACTUALLY HAD JUST COME DOWN FROM A POINT. ONE FIVE TWO POINT ONE ALL IN OUR POINT. OH EIGHT SO YOU SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE. ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ALCOHOL THE NUMBER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN IS A HIGH NUMBER BUT OUR OUR LAW NOW SAYS THAT THAT YOU'RE IMPAIRED AND APPOINT A WAITER BUFF. FEDERAL LAW ON NTSB HAS A RECOMMENDATION TO LOWER THE B. AC TO POINT OH FIVE OR LOWER. SO THAT THAT IN AND OF ITSELF MIGHT HAVE THE IMPACT YOUR SEEKING HERE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DEATHS BY. BILL WHO ARE IMPAIRED AS A RESULT OF ALCOHOL. IT WOULD HAVE A BROAD DETERRENT TO BRING DOWN THE OF FATALITIES IF YOU'RE TO LOWER THE BE A C. CORRECT -- BUT THEY'RE STILL WILL BE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO DRIVE IMPAIRED AND THAT IS FOR THE IGNITION INTERLOCK WOULD COME INTO PLAY IN TERMS OF DETERRING THEM FROM GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL AFTER THEY'VE CONSUMED ALCOHOL. ACCEPTED PHASES POINTED OUT MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE CARS TO THE DRIVING FRIENDS CARS. I'M WONDERING IS ARE SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE. WHERE WE COULD IDENTIFY THEM NOT BY? THE YOU KNOW THAT DEVICE BUT THE OF THUMB PRINT THEY'RE GONNA BE DRIVING SOMEBODY ELSE'S CAR IS OR IS THERE SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT MIGHT HAVE A BETTER. AFFECTED DETERRING PEOPLE GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL WITH A IN ANY LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT THERE IS TECHNOLOGY THAT IS. BEING DEVELOPED FOR SPECIFICALLY ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING IF THE DRIVER [inaudible] DRIVER THIS. D. A. D. S. S. -- AND I CAN'T I SORRY CAN'T RECALL -- YES DADS IN IT WASN'T NAME BY MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING IT WAS NAMED BY THE AUTOMOBILE ALLIANCE AND ITS DEFECTIVE -- DAD'S EFFECTIVE ALCOHOL DETECTION SAFETY SYSTEM AND IT IS USES SKIN SPECTROSCOPY LOOKS MUCH LIKE WE USE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR PULSE OX READING. AND I WAS ACTUALLY AT AND NET SO WHEN THEY UNVEILED THE CONCEPT CAR AND IT WAS IT HAD COME OVER WITH FROM SWEDEN. IT USES -- TERROR ONE PROVIDERS TO IT'S IT'S MUCH. MORE. SENSITIVE THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY EVEN IN THE THE SOBRIETY FIELD TEST THANK YOU VERY SO PERHAPS NOT JUST IDENTIFYING ONE FORM OF TECHNOLOGY. BUT IN AS THE BILL PROCEEDS PERHAPS EXPANDING ITS FOR THAT WE USE THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WOULD SEEM TO ME. TO TO AND ALSO SO THAT WE CAN INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE DRIVING THEIR OWN CARS A BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THAT'S A CONCERN -- AND IN FACT MIGHT EVEN INTENTIONALLY. FIND SOMEBODY ELSE'S CAR TO DRIVE AND AND AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THAT BEING SAID ALSO -- IN YOUR RESEARCH -- THE ARGUMENT THAT AS MADE THE ODD PEOPLE WHO TEND TO OF HAD JUST ONE DRUNK DRIVING -- YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE CAUGHT A COME TO JESUS MOMENT WHEN THEY STOP -- THEY REALIZE THEY SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING WHAT ARE THE STATISTICS ON THAT. I'M SORRY CAN CAN USE -- IS. WE HAVE ALCOHOLICS TO DRIVE. AND I THINK THEY'RE THE BIGGEST RISK THAT WE HAVE ON THE ROAD I THINK WE ALL AGREE. AND THE FACT THAT IT THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ADDRESSING ALCOHOLISM IN ADVANCE SO THAT. WE DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN AT THE END OF THE ROAD IF YOU WILL YEAH WHEN THEY'RE BONTA BUSTED FOR DRUNK DRIVING. CATCH THEM SO WE DO WITH ALCOHOLISM UP FRONT BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A SINGULAR ARREST FOR DRUNK DRIVING BECAUSE THEY THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES SOCIAL DRINKERS AND THEY'VE HAD MORE ALCOHOL. THE THAN A POINT OH EIGHT BLOOD ALCOHOL WOULD ALLOW AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THOSE PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE TO RECIDIVIST OR TO REPEAT AND I'M WONDERING WHAT THE STATISTICS ARE A IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE BASED UPON THE RESEARCH DONE BY YOUR ORGANIZATION I DON'T HAVE STATISTICS ON THAT RIGHT NOW BUT I CAN GET THAT TO YOU. THE PERHAPS A THROUGH THE THROUGH THE CHAIR IF THEY'RE STILL DOES SOMEBODY HAVE THOSE STATISTICS. MISTER HERNANDEZ THANK YOU MISTER -- IF I RECALL AND THIS IS BASED ON THE DMV STUDIES AND AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST CAUTION THAT I'M DOING OFF OF MEMORY THAT I LOOK AT THE STATISTICS FAIRLY OFTEN. BY RECALL I BELIEVE IT IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND 3% THE RE OFFEND IN THE FIRST YEAR. AND THEN I THINK IT GOES SOMEWHERE INTO CLOSE 212% AGAIN IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OFF ON THIS OVER I BELIEVE A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD. SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR PERIOD I COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OFF ON THAT BUT IT IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE IT MIGHT EVEN BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER ON THAT FIRST YEAR BUT I'M I'M. THAT'S THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE OF FIRST TIME OFFENDERS CRACKED. SO THAT THEY FIRST THE FIRST TIME CONVENTIONAL DERRICK I'VE HEARD OF THIS SENATOR JACKSON HAVE BEEN THAT IF YOU. BY THE TIME YOU GET THAT FIRST DO YOU I KNOW YOU PROBABLY DRIVEN ANYTIME ANYTIME I UNDERSTAND WRONG. BUT THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN CAUGHT NOW YOU'RE CAUGHT IN IMUS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE. HAVE THAT MOMENT WHEN THEY BEEN CAUGHT -- IN LESS THEY ARE ALCOHOICS THEY ARE LIKELY TO REASSESS THEIR BEHAVIOR AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO RE OFFEND I'M JUST A IS THAT TRUE OR FALSE. FALSE I BELIEVE THE MAN THAT KILLED MY SON HAD -- FIVE PREVIOUS -- SUSPENSIONS AND HE WAS DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE AT NIGHT AT POINT OH NINE SIX BUT MY IN POINT IS THAT THAT HE HAD HAD PROBABLY SEVERAL OTHER. DO YOU Y. ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS SO I I WAS A CONVICTED OKAY BECAUSE THE THE OUR LEGAL SYSTEM HE WAS A YOUNG MAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. AND THEY FELT THAT HE NEEDED HELP AND HE DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GETTING THAT HELP. AND WHEN I STE FIRST STARTED COMING UP HERE TWELVE YEARS IT WAS SENATOR BOB HUFF THAT TOLD ME AS DRACONIAN TO DO THIS AND I SAID IT'S DRACONIAN TO ALLOW FOR PEOPLE DAY. I UNDERSTAND I I'M JUST AND I I APPRECIATE WOULD YOU SAY I JUST WANT TO TRY TO GET THAT ANSWER BECAUSE I I I SUPPORT I SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE I JUST WANT TO GET. TO TO THE WHETHER OR NOT WHEN SOMEONE HAS BEEN CONVICTED. OF A OR MAYBE JUST POPPED ONCE OR TWICE FOR DRUNK DRIVING IF THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT ALCOHOLIC CLEARLY THIS YOUNG MAN HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM. BUT IF THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE WHO DON'T. REALIZE THAT THEY ARE IMPAIRED YOU KNOW WE CALL PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO BE DRUNK PEOPLE DON'T THINK THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE DRUNK. JUST IMPAIRED AND THAT'S AN EDUCATION PROCESS THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD DO BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ARRESTED WHO ARE ONLY QUOTE UNQUOTE IMPAIRED. WHAT IT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE WITH ONE ONE CONFRONTATION WITH THE LAW? ONE DRUNK DRIVING CONVICTION ARE LIKELY TO REPEAT. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I'M JUST I JUST WANT TO GET THAT ANSWER. IF WE COULD -- BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE TWO OR MORE YOU KNOW YOU THE THESE ARE PEOPLE BASICALLY ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL -- OR MAKE PROP MAKE GOOD DECISIONS I THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT HERE'S PEOPLE OF HAD A ONE DRUNK DRIVING. MANY OF THEM WILL MAKE GOOD DECISIONS I UNDERSTAND AND MANY OF THEM WON'T BUT I'M WONDERING WHAT PERCENTAGES ACT THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THAT THAT INFORMATION. SENATOR JACKSON'S. AND MISTER HERNANDEZ HAVE YOU FOUND IT ON YOUR IPHONE YET -- YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE IN FACT I WAS REMINDED OF ONE OF THE STATISTICS WE HAVE IS IT. IS IT ONE THIRD RE OFFEND. ONE THIRD YES OKAY. BUT WHAT IS SET THROUGH IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] YES. THE RATES ARE LOW. ALRIGHT WELL IF. WE ARE NOT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. FOR SO T. THE TWENTY FIVE OR 30% STILL A BIG NUMBER THAT THAT GOES TO YOUR CONCERNS. ARE WELL I AM ARE THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION IS -- I'M CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE NOT DEVELOPED -- AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING IMPAIRED BECAUSE OF THE USE OF RUGS -- SO SOMEONE MIGHT BE TAKING MEDICATION OF ONE DRINK THE BLOOD ALCOHOL COME OUT A POINT -- THREE BUT THEY ARE IMPAIRED AND IF WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO SAVE LIVES WHICH I THINK IS THE GOAL FOR ALL OF US IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF IMPAIRMENT IS. SUBSTANCE RELATED AND I'M WONDERING IS THERE ANYTHING GOING ON NOW WITH THE NTSB I MEAN WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO JUDGE MARIJUANA FOR FORTY YEARS. SO AND NOW MARIJUANA IS LEGAL LICENSE -- HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIGURE OUT OF PEOPLE ARE IMPAIRED DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OF CANNABIS ANOTHER NOW LEGAL DRUGS YEAH WE -- NTSB DOES HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A WAY. TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT UNTIL WE HAVE THAT WE REALLY. CAN'T DO MUCH IN TERMS OF ARRESTS OR ANYTHING I MEAN WE HAVE THE WE ALSO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERTS -- SO THAT -- THEY HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF TRAINING TO DETECT AND DETERMINE IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS IMPAIRED BY DRUGS ANY TYPE OF DRUG. AND WE HAVE -- RECOMMENDATIONS TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THOSE ARRESTS FOR DRUG IMPAIRMENT BUT IN TERMS OF HAVING US LIKE A BIRD BUT BE A C. FOR DRUG IMPAIRMENT THAT IS WE ARE UNABLE TO DO THAT AT THIS POINT. IN YOUR ROOM IF I COULD LINE ABOUT ACTION TO ME WE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM FORTY YEARS WE DID AND AND AS YOU KNOW IT AND YOU WITH YOUR HELP LAST YEAR. THERE IS WORK BEING DONE WITH I THINK IS UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO OR SANDY AT UC SAN DIEGO WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL THEY'RE NOW CONDUCTING THE STUDIES. AND THIS THE THE RESULTS OF THAT SHOULD BE BACK BY THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR IN FACT WE'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE AMENDED SOME LEGISLATION TO TRY AND INCLUDE. WHEN THEY DETERMINE WHAT THAT LEVEL OF IMPAIR WHAT THAT LEVEL IS THAT CREATES THAT IMPAIRMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THEN WE CAN? WE CAN TRY TO PREVENT THAT SO SUPPORT THIS AYE IF I MAY JUST CLOSE BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER -- ALTERNATIVE METHODS BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ALSO MOVE WITH THE ARE WITH THE PERSON -- AND ALSO CONSIDER THAT IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TRY TO GET THESE PEOPLE OFF THE ROAD WE'VE GOT TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST DRIVING IMPAIRED AS RESULT ALCOHOL. TO SENATOR JACKSON IF I MAY ADD TO THAT AS A TRAUMA -- ARE IN NURSING THE TRAUMA CENTER WE DO TRAUMA CAM PANELS ON OUR CRASHES THAT COME IN. THERE ARE TWENTY DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT WE TEST. FOR AND IT'S NEGATIVE POSITIVE NEGATIVE POSITIVE UNTIL YOU GET TO ALCOHOL AND THERE'S A LEVEL THERE IS NO -- MEANT LEVEL FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT WE HAVE SO WE HAVE TO HAVE PER SE LAWS THERE I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE ANY WAY. THAT WE COULD GET AN IMPAIRMENT LEVEL ON EACH DIFFERENT THE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT WE HAVE. SO PER SE LAWS MAY BE WHAT WE NEED AND I DO KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY IS BEING DEVELOPED -- TO BY SOME OF THE COMPANIES TO MEASURE THE LEVEL OF DRUG THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR LONG ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES. SENATOR BRADLEY YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE. BUT AS YOU AND I DISCUSSED I HAVE SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DMV REPORT THEY SAID IT WAS. THEY WOULDN'T EXTEND THE PILOT PROGRAM AND THEY FOUND IT TO BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. THOSE -- STATEMENTS BY THE DMV THAT STATED THAT AND ALSO REMOVING THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION I TALKED TO SOME OUR FRIENDS AND YOU AND I HAD OUR DISCUSSION WHERE JUDGES AND THEY STATED PREFERRED THE DISCRETION OF DECIDING INDIVIDUALLY VERSUS A MANDATORY. REQUIREMENT FOR THE TECHNICIAN Là. BUT WE HAVE THIRTY TWO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE GONE THIS DIRECTION AND THEY HAVE IT MANDATORY FOR ALL OFFENSES SO IF IF THEY FOUND. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IF THEY THERE WAS A BETTER WAY THEY WOULD HAVE A DEVELOPMENT AT THE TIME BUT I DON'T THE THE WORDING. THE DMV REPORTS ALSO SHOWED A STRAW INCLUDING A STRONG AND RELIABLE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN AYE ID'S FOR FIRST TIME OFFENDERS AND REDUCE DO YOU WHY. I'M QUOTING THAT. SO I THINK THAT SOMEONE IN. IS NOT CONCLUSIVE THAT IT DID NOT HELP AS WE CAN SEE IT DID SHOW STRONG RELIABLE ASSOCIATION WITH THE REDUCTION. AND HOW WOULD THAT NUMBER IS WHETHER IT'S TEN FIFTEEN A HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE IF IT'S 10% OF THOSE THOUSAND THE WORKING. LIVE THAT SIGNIFICANT IN CALIFORNIA AND IN ANOTHER LEVEL THAT WAS RAISED IN TERMS OF THEY ALSO MADE IT MADE COMMENTS IN THE ACCIDENTS WERE NOT RUDE OR IN THOSE COUNTIES WITH THE PILOT PROGRAM THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF ACCIDENTS IN THOSE IN THOSE PILOTS WELL. IT DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AT ALL THE MILES DRIVEN AND HIS CERTAINLY IF IN THOSE COUNTIES IT. A LOT MORE MILES DRIVEN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAN SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTIES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE IN THOSE MILES MORE YOU DRIVE THE MORE ACTION SURE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN. SO THE I I DON'T SEE THAT THE THE STUDY THE PILOT WAS IT SHOULD CERTAINLY SHOWED LAST YEAR. ANOTHER. AND CONCLUSIVE ENOUGH FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE SEVEN ZERO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS SEVEN ZERO ON THE FLORIDA VOTE THIRTY NINE ZERO WITH THE WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY -- WRITTEN AND THE WAY IT IS TODAY THAT AMENDMENT CAME AT THE END AND STILL WITHOUT. A CLEAR IDENTIFICATION OF THAT SO I DON'T KNOW IF. THE STUDY IS NOT. THE STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY THE DMV IS NOT CONCLUSIVE IN DETERMINING THAT THERE'S IT AND IT DOES SHOW THAT IT DID REDUCE RECIDIVISM. THAT THAT TO ME IS THE KEY AND FOLLOWING A LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINA BARBER -- AS RELATES TO FIRST TIME OFFENDERS -- SHE USED THE TERM. A COME TO JESUS MOMENT I THINK IT'S OF SOBERING MOMENT. FOR THE FRIENDS THAT I'VE HAD THAT HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. FOR THE FIRST TIME DIEM BE. THEY DON'T OUR A DR IMPAIRED ANYMORE A WHAT IT WAS A SOBERING AWAKING EXPERIENCE FOR THEM. AND NOW WHAT TNC MOST OF THEM THAT SAY HEY NOW THEY'RE GOING ON IN THERE AND HAVE A DRINK THEY DON'T DRIVING. THEY TAKE. KERR SERVICES SO THAT TO GROWING -- NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO NO I'M GONNA GO OUT I'M ABSENT COCKTAIL NO MATTER HOW MANY I'M GONNA TAKE KERR SURE SO -- I I JUST. IF THE SHIP WITH AN ATTITUDE AND AND I AND I AND I KNOW WHAT PERSON FROM THE FOLKS WELL I TALKED TO THE TO I DON'T DRIVE ANYMORE. IF I HAVE A DRINK. THE BUT THIS THIS THERE ISN'T JUST QUOTED CHAU 30% A THIRD A THIRD [inaudible] DO. THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE THE TWO THIRDS OF TO HE'S JUST GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT AND IF THAT THURSDAY DOES. THAT'S A PROBLEM. AND IF THEY DO NOT PUT ANA IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE AFTER THEY'RE CONVICTED. THEY HAVE A YEAR OF LICENSE SUSPENSION WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE -- THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET A RESTRICTED LICENSE. SO THAT THAT ARTIST OF IN THERE THAT'S THAT'S THE OTHER PENALTY THAT THEY WILL HAVE RATHER THAN THAT. AND I KNOW YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST AND AS WE SPOKE YESTERDAY BECAUSE OF THE SLIDING PAY SCHEDULE AND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT -- WAS WAS MENTIONED -- RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S DOING WHAT THEY COMMITTED TO DOING OUR PART OF THE AGREEMENT IS THEN WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT AND THERE IS ENFORCEMENT -- ASPECTS TO THE BILL BUT THE COST COULD BE NO MORE THAN -- SEVEN DOLLARS A YEAR AND INSTALLATION COULD BE NO MORE THAN TEN TWELVE DOLLARS FOR THE PRICE I MEAN SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH AND TWELVE DOLLARS FOR INSTALLATION -- SO THIS GLIDING SCALE DOES ACCOMMODATE THAT FOR THOSE THAT -- THE CAMPUS THAT SECOND DO YOU EYES A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH AND WE'RE THESE COMPANIES AND INSTALLERS JUST ONE COMPANY OR MULTIPLE GUN MOTOR. COMPANY TO THE SERVICE IN DIFFERENT [inaudible] AT A ARE LISTED ON THE DMV WEBSITE. AND THEN IT'S APPROVED. RATE THEM MISTER HERNANDEZ I BELIEVE YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR SENATOR JACKSON'S. EVERYTHING MISTER CHAIR -- SO I PULLED UP THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN DO YOU AYE STATISTICS FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES -- AND IT SHOWS THAT AS I INDICATED ON DURING THE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR. OF ISSUE AYE OFFENSE -- THE RECIDIVISM RATE IS BETWEEN FOUR AND 5% -- FOR THAT'S THE ROUTE REPEAT AND THEN AFTER ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO IS UP TO ABOUT 15% NOW THIS COVERS THE PERIOD. OF OFFENDERS FOR TWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SO THAT WAS BEFORE SOME OF STRONGER DO YOU I LAWS WERE IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE INDICATORS OF THAT THE RECIDIVISM. RATE IS ACTUALLY DECREASING SUBSTANTIALLY. IN CALIFORNIA SO -- ANYWAY I POINT YOU TO THAT REPORTS TO HONOR PAGES BUT IF YOU LOOK AT I BELIEVE PAGE -- FIFTY FIFTY FIVE SOME AROUND THERE IT HAS OF STATISTICS TAKE A LOOK AT IT -- BUT THAT'S WHAT IT IS FOR THE FIRST FOUR YEARS ABOUT 5% 425% THE FIRST YEAR. AND THEN IT GOES UP TO ABOUT 15% OF ABOUT FOUR YEAR FORTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD -- CELLS ALSO BEFORE THE RAPID EXPANSION OF UBER AND LEFT FLASHES ABSOLUTELY AND ALSO BEFORE SOME OF THE STRONGER DO I LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN Q. INCLUDING THE PILOT PRO. PROGRAM SO OTHERS. PIC RESURGENT RESTRICT THIS SENATOR WINNER DID YOU HAVE. YES NO QUESTION. I THANK YOU A SURVEYS CHAIR ON A MAP AND SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL AND I THINK I HAD ASKED TO BE A CO AUTHOR SO WELCOME ON AT SOME POINT. AND OF THOSE BEING AMENDED -- AND I AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS ACTUALLY IN THE G. OKAY MAYBE FOR OF NEVER TALKED ABOUT IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD -- IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX ALL DATE MYSELF -- A OP MY AUNTS MY FATHER'S ONLY -- A SIBLING WAS ARE KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER -- IN NEW JERSEY. AND IT WAS -- I WAS VERY YOUNG AT THE TIME BUT I STILL -- WILL NEVER FORGET AT HER. FUNERAL MY GRANDMOTHER. YOU'RE JUST BREAKING DOWN COLLAPSING AT THE GRAVE SITE -- FOR THE LOSS OF HER -- OLD HER OLDEST -- AND IT -- IMPACTED OUR FAMILY PERMANENTLY -- AND THE TRAGEDY WAS ESPECIALLY ON TOP OF THAT HORRIFIC TRAGEDY THE EXTRA TRAGEDY. WAS A BACKGROUND THE LAWS. ON ARE PRETTY EYES WERE JUST A PATHETIC AND THE THE GUY WHO DID THIS TO MY TO MY AUNT'S IN MY FAMILY TO MY UNCLE TO MY COUSINS MY FATHER TO MY GRANDMOTHER -- TO ME TO MY SISTER TO ALL OF US -- GOD BASICALLY A SLAP ON THE WRIST AND HI AND SO WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN SAN AND THE LAWS ARE A LOT TOUGHER NOW AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY I'M SURE HAVE. HAD A I KNOW IT'S HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM -- THE RIDE SCHERING -- CLEARLY ISA HELP IN GIVING PEOPLE OPTIONS -- BUT IT'S NOT EVERYTHING AND IF WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TOOL -- THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WE KNOW HAS. HAS GOTTEN INTO A CAR. AND AND ENGAGE IN DRUNK DRIVING SAYS IS NOT TRYING TO BE PRODUCTIVE ABOUT WHAT A RANDOM PERSON WILL DO THIS IS ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAS ALREADY ENGAGE AND DO YOU LIVE -- I'M PROBABLY IF IF THE PERSON HAS ALREADY BEEN ARRESTED. THEN I'M GONNA GAS THAT PERSON WAS PINE UP THE ONLY TIME THE PERSON HAS GOTTEN INTO A CAR DRUNK. SO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO PRESENTS A RISK FACTOR AND WE CAN TAKE AN ACTION. THAT IS NOT. YOU KNOW PUTTING SOMEONE IN JAIL THEM THERE MAY BE A SEPARATE THING BUT SO SOME THAT'S NOT BEING PUNITIVE. BUT IS BEING PROPHYLACTIC AND ALLOWING THE PERSON TO DRIVE THERE WERE NOT GOING TO JUST TAKE AWAY YOUR YOU COULD JUST TAKE AWAY THE LICENSE SO YOU CAN NEVER DRIVE AGAIN AND IMPACTS SOMEONE SCHOOL OR OR WORK OR MORE SO WE'RE GONNA LET YOU DRIVE. WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU GOING TO HAVE THAT PRIVILEGE. BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS ONE THING -- I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY -- AND AND I I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULDN'T DO THAT SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WIENER. I WOULD LOVE TO BE SENATOR SKINNER HEARD I THE MEDIA LET ME LET ME TAKE THIS BEVERAGE. SORRY CENTER WIENER MY APOLOGIES -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- I HAVE A FEW. WERE QUICK WHEN CENTER HILL -- THE FIRST IS THE COST IT'S BEEN MENTIONED A FEW TIMES. WHAT IS A COST TO PUT IT? BY AIDID FOR INSTALLATION IS SEVENTY FIVE FOR OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS THE COST PER MONTH IS -- ABOUT -- I THINK IT'S THREE DOLLARS A DAY COULD BE SO TO COULD BE ABOUT FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY DOLLARS PER PER MONTH. FOR THE SIX MONTHS AND THEN THAT WOULD THAT COST IS ON A SLIDING SCALE IF YOU ARE FROM CAN FROM 1100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL UP. THE COST IS 10% IF YOU'RE A 100% THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL UP COST ALL THE WAY UP TO THE FULL RETAIL AND THAT IS ALL FUNDED BY THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE OF THE PRODUCT AT THE 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. A TO A LOCAL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR A YOU'D PAY 90% OF THE COST BUT JUST SEVENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO INSTALL THE LOWEST INCOME PERSON IS. A STARK YOU I'M I'VE BEEN LAYS A FAIR. AND LETTING EVERYBODY JUST TALKED BUT I THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. THINGS GO THROUGH THE CHAIR SOLD. THANK YOU -- YOU MENTIONED SIX MONTHS. YES THAT'S THE REQUIREMENT IN THE SIX MONTHS CAN START. THE MINUTE YOU GET ARRESTED BECAUSE YOUR LICENSE IS TAKEN AWAY FROM UNISYS BENDED LICENSE SO IF YOU HAVE A SUSPENDED LICENSE. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE THAT INSTALLED ON YOUR VEHICLE AND YOU CAN START THAT SIX MONTH CLOCK RIGHT THEN. AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO WHAT YOU COULD MITCHELL WOULD HAVE TO HAVE IT FOR SIX MONTHS WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT FOR SIX MONTHS AND IT'S TAKEN IT'S AN ESSAY ON IT. OVER WITH A SECONDOFFENSE WOULD BE ONE YEAR THEN WHAT IF YOU OWN MULTIPLE CARS. WITHIN YOU DON'T USE THE CAR THAT HAS THE ID. THEN. AND THEN YOU'RE THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE CAUGHT DRIVING. UNDER THE INFLUENCE WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES YOUR BREAKING THE LAW. THE LOSS SAID YOU HAVE TO DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH MY ID THAT SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MERRY OF THE LAW SAYS YOU HAVE TO DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH AN ID. AND IF YOU DON'T BURKE BROUGH BREAKING THE LAW IT WHAT IS THE PENALTY WHILE THE PENALTY THE JUDGE THAT RISK IS REVIEWING YOUR CASE IN THAT HANDLES YOUR YOUR YOUR CERTAIN CASE THAT'S WHY THEY ALSO GET A READING WHEN YOU DRIVE. EVERY TIME YOU START THAT VEHICLE BY BLOWING INTO IT THAT IS RECORDED IN ITS RECALIBRATED EVERY MONTH TO SEE EXACTLY HOW YOUR WHAT YOUR BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN OKAY OKAY. FOR THEY WOULD CATCH YOU THE MEMBERSHIP YES OKAY HOWEVER IT IS BUT IT IS A IT DOES RECORD THAT. AND IT'S REVIEW AND WE'RE HAVING MAYBE ON THE FUTURE SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGIES SO IF YOU WERE TO GET INTO A CAR THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE WOULD YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE AN I ID. I DO NOT DRIVE A SO I WOULD NOT THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ID OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DO I HAVE A A MOTION US SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- CEDAR HILLS DID YOUR LAST POINT CONFUSE ME A BIT -- SO THE SIX MONTH CLOCK STARTS. THE POINT AT WHICH YOUR LICENSE IS SUSPENDED. KIND OF WHAT'S THE VALUE OF THE POINT IS. A AN ADDITIONAL KIND OF CHECK ON YOUR BEHAVIOR WHY WOULD YOU HAVE THE CLOCK STARTS TICKING WHEN I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO DRIVE MY CAR WELL YOU THE CLOCK STARTS BECAUSE YOU'RE. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DRIVE IF YOU HAVE AN ID INSTALLED YOU CAN THEN DRIVE YOUR VEHICLES FOR YOUR LICENSE IS NOT SUSPENDED. YOU GET A SIX MONTH PERIOD WHERE YOU CAN IN THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WITH MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE U. EYES THEY LOSE THEIR LICENSE BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO GO TO WORK FOR I STILL HAVE TO TAKE THEIR KIDS.

THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. DO I HAVE A MOTION. CENTER MORALE MAKES A MOTION -- MADAM SECRETARY WHEN WE TAKE A ROLL. MOTION IS THE PASTOR PROBES SKINNER. WARLOCK HI MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD. JACKSON MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORALE. I WIENER. WIENER AYE. IT WAS THE VOTE IS. OKAY THE POLICE FORCE ZERO AND WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SENATORS. HILL THANK YOU MA'AM -- CENTER WITH. NIELSEN HAS BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING. OKAY. OKAY HE LEFT -- THIS. TWO WEEKS WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO PRESENT AT THIS POINT. SENATOR NIELSEN YOU HAVE THE FLOOR [inaudible] WELCOME. THIS WOULD BE. FOR SB [inaudible] FOUR TWO NINE FORTY NINE THE LAUNDRY OKAY MEMBERS. THIS ALLOWS. LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE BIG [inaudible] CONTACTING. I. N. S.. IN ORDER [inaudible] TO THAT DEFY. AND WHEN AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF DO YOU HI. NOW THIS IS A VERY SPECIFIC AND NARAL [inaudible] OPPORTUNITY. IT IS CONSISTENT. WITH SENATE BILL. FORTY TWO THAT WAS CARRIED. BY OUR FORMER PRO TEM AND THAT. LEGISLATION LIMITED. THE ABILITY. THE ONE FORTUNATE TO CONTACT I AN S.. IN MANY INSTANCES NOW WHY WOULD WE WANT TO BE. AN EXCEPTION IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE [inaudible] IT. CAME JUST COMES TO MIND THAT. AS THIS LONG HEARING PROCEEDED HERE JUST BEFORE [inaudible] HOUSE SERIOUS. DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE CAN BE. IN A DECEMBER. A YEAR AGO [inaudible] OFFICER SAYING. LOST HIS LIFE. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT. FOR HIS ARREST. RELATED TO THE I. D. Y. CHARGE. HE HAD A PRIOR D. Y.. AND IN COLLUDED HAVE PHYSICAL INJURY. TO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL. I CAN'T ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT THIS. WOULD HAVE SAVED. OFFICE THINGS LIVE. BUT THE POINT IS THAT COULD HAVE. WITH THE OUTSTANDING WARRANT. HE COULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO PROSECUTION [inaudible] INDOOR DEPORTATION. SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'RE SINGLING ANYTHING OUT AND AND THE AUTHOR OF THAT LEGISLATION. IN FACT SAID IN THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. IF THERE WERE ACTIVE WARRANTS ON THIS INDIVIDUAL. ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WERE NOT STOP BY SB FIFTY FOUR FROM REPORTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TWO I AN S. [inaudible] WHEN CONDITIONS? AS THOSE EXIST. AND THE GOVERNOR WHO SIGNED THAT LEGISLATION [inaudible] ALSO FIND. THE POLICE TO THE SHERIFF. COULD HAVE TOLD IMMIGRATION. SERVICE ABOUT THIS INDIVIDUAL. THAT HE AD BEEN ARRESTED AND ACTUALLY CONVICTED TWICE OF THE WHY. AND THERE WAS A WARRANT. FOR HIS ARREST. SO I WILL ARGUE THAT THIS IS TOTALLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT LEGISLATION. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE. THE STATUTORY TOOL. FOR ONE FORTUNATE. TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS. THE COULD BE A DANGER. SIMPLY PUT THAT'S THE BILL. AND I DID NOT BRING ANY WITNESSES I JUST SUBMIT THE BILL FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] AND IN HOPES THAT JILL. HAVING BEEN REPORTED. THAT HE HAS THESE CONDITIONS THAT IS LIFE. THESE CONVICTIONS [inaudible] AND REMAINS [inaudible] THE DANGER. THAT'S I SUBMIT THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON -- WHY YOU DID NOT BRING WITNESSES LET ME SEE IF THERE IS ANYONE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL? RIGHT SEEING NONE LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE -- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I AND GRAHAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SB FIFTY FOUR WAS ENACTED BECAUSE ENTANGLEMENT OF LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY DOLLARS AND WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION UNDERMINED THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SAFETY AND WELL BEING. CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS PAID A HIGH PRICE WHEN WE PARTICIPATED IN ISIS CONTROVERSIAL ON FAILED SECURED COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. ACROSS THE STATE SIXTY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY AND HAD LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DETAINING AND TRANSFER IN PEOPLE TO ICE. SB FIFTY SB THIS BILL UNDERMINES THE BALANCE STRUCK BY SB FIFTY FOUR WHICH EXEMPTED FOR PROTECTIONS CERTAIN QUALIFYING CONVICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLEFELONY DO YOU EYES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS LIST OF EXEMPTIONS. BUT THIS BILL ADDS AND MISDEMEANOR DERIVE FENCES TO THE LIST OF EXEMPTIONS AND PLACES BOTH TYPES OF DIY IS OUTSIDE THE TIME RESTRICTIONS OF CURRENT LAW. AS SUCH THIS BILL AUTHORIZES COOPERATION BASED ON DECADES OLD CONVICTIONS WHICH DO NOT REFLECT A PERSON'S REHABILITATION OR CHANGE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS DOES NOT ALIGN WITH CALIFORNIA'S COMMONSENSE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS. IT ALSO INJECTS UNNECESSARY CONFUSION INTO A HIGHLY TECHNICAL AREA OF LAW. THE TERM USED IN THE BILL COOPERATION IS BROAD FAKE AN UNDEFINED MESSAGE COULD RESULT IN COOPERATION. BEYOND WHAT IS AUTHORIZED BY CURRENT LAW. IT ALSO TIES COOPERATION TO A PERSON UNLAWFUL PRESENCE IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS A HIGHLY COMPLEX AREA OF LAW. AND OFFICERS RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW ARE BARRED FROM ENQUIRING ABOUT A PERSON'S IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS WAS PUT INTO LAW BECAUSE BEFORE THIS TOOK PLACE. RACIAL PROFILING AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENTS AND HARASSMENT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WARRIOR CONDUCTED AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE'S PERCEIVED IMMIGRATION STATUS FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BECAUSE RESPONSE WHICH ARE THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS IN STRONG OPPOSITION. CAN YOU TAKE A WITH PEOPLE CALIFORNIANS STRONG OPPOSITION. UNDER A RIVER WITH A CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN STRONG OPPOSITION. PLEASE THE TRUTH ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG OPPOSITION. EDDIE CARMONA WHERE PEOPLE CALIFORNIANS ARE CRIMINAL ACT IN STRONG OPPOSITION. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSESIN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEING NINE LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY ISCUSSION ON THE PART OF ANY -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M. CENTER NIELSEN I THINK THAT -- HAS ALREADY BEEN -- BROUGHT OUT IS THAT SB. FIFTY FOUR ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INTERACT WITH THEIR IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES RELATED TO FELONY DE WEISS -- SO THIS BILL. IS. THIS BILL PRIMARILY -- ONE COULD SAY AMENDS SB FIFTY FOUR OR AT LEAST -- INTERFERES WITH WHAT WAS APPROVED IN SB. FIFTY FOUR AND AS THIS AS A PERSON THAT SUPPORTED THAT BILL WHICH IS NOW LAW -- I M.. NOT COMFORTABLE RECOMMENDING A FIVE VOTE ON YOUR BILL. BECAUSE I FEEL THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT WE SB. FIFTY FOUR IS BY ITS NATURE LIMITED DUE TO CERTAIN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES THAT THE STATE CANNOT INTERFERE WITH AND PRIMARILY WHAT THE STATE DID IN. IN THE APPROVING SB FIFTY FOUR IS BSICALLY. ENCOURAGE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO NOT VOLUNTARILY COOPERATE. WITH IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES AND MINOR OFFENSES SO -- I A I'M NOT SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TO INITIATIVE. ON IN IF THERE IS ANY OTHER COMMENT OR QUESTION CENTER TOMORROW. RIGHT SO WE HAVE. A MOTION SENATOR JACKSON YEAH CHEST CHESTER AN OBSERVATION HERE -- I SURE THE THE SURE IS CONCERNED. BUT WE HAVE A GRAHAM NOW THAT IS ACTUALLY. WITHOUT ANY LEADERSHIP THAT IS CHAOTIC AND RUNNING AMOK DHS IS WITHOUT A SECRETARY DEPUTY DIRECTOR ICE DIRECTOR OF FEMA DIRECTOR SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR INSPECTOR GENERAL DIRECTOR. I MEAN HOW IN THE WORLD CAN WE EVER EXPECT TO HAVE ANY KIND OF COHESIVENESS -- IN THIS THE HOW WE DEAL. WITH OF PEOPLE WHO ARGUABLY ARE HERE ILLEGALLY WHEN THERE'S NO ONE AT THE HELM. AND INTEREST ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDS ME. THE CHAOS THAT THAT EXISTS NOW IN THIS PROGRAM FEDERALLY AND IN ANY OTHER ND FOR THAT REASON ALONE YOUR RESPECTIVE OF WHERE WE ARE -- I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS THERE IS NO THERE THERE THERE'S NO LEADERSHIP IT IS CHAOS IT'S LIKE A BANANA REPUBLIC WHEN IT COMES TO THESE SSUES SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT A DRUNK DRIVING BUT UNTIL WE HAVE SOME. GROWN UPS IN THE ROOM -- I CERTAINLY COULD IMAGINE SUPPORTING THIS KIND OF AN EFFORT. AND THE JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH THE JUST ASTONISHING THAT THERE'S NO LEADERSHIP ANYWHERE IN THIS ISSUE -- ONE MOMENT SIR. ANYONE ELSE. SENATOR NIELSEN WELL I WOULD JUST WAY IN PERSON MET AGAIN I BELIEVE THAT YOU COULD DO THIS AS YOUR CLOTHES SINCE I DON'T SEE EITHER OF THOSE TO DO THAT. THE I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SB. FIFTY FOUR AS STATED. BY THE AUTHOR. AND IT IS AND THE FIRM'S ANOTHER. TO AND PUTS THE SPOTLIGHT. ON THIS PARTICULAR. TYPE OF AND IT DIDN'T INDIVIDUALS WITH THIS TYPE OF HISTORY [inaudible] AND IT WAS FAR AS MANY YEARS AGO. SO THAT MEANS THAT. YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WHATEVER. AND YOUR HONOR ON TEN YEARS PASS. DOES NINE DOESN'T OBVIATE. THAT BEHAVIOR. AND IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN YOU DIDN'T COMMIT. FUTURE CRIMES WE DID NOT GOT. APPREHENDED. AND THIS IS ABOUT COOPERATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPREHENDING. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THAT'S ON THE RECORD. AND THAT DOES INDICATE INDICATE FUTURE DANGERS. I WOULD ASK. BUT I WILL. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN SO I WILL ASK FOR THE ROLL CALL THAT ALSO NOTE -- WE'RE NOT HEARING YOUR OTHER TWO BILLS BECAUSE THEY'RE ON CONSENT. OKAY SO THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE FORMAL HEARING ON FAT AND HAPPY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR OTHER TWO BILLS ON CONSENT TODAY -- AND LET'S DO A ROLL CALL.

SEVEN SIXTEEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES IN HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SEVEN SIXTEEN WHICH WILL TAKE A CORRECTIVE STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT INCARCERATED YOUTH. WHO ALREADY HOLD A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA HAVE ACCESS TO A COLLEGE EDUCATION OR CAREER VOCATIONAL TRAINING? A QUALITY EDUCATION HAS THE POWER TO RE DIRECT THE LIVES OF ANY YOUNG PERSON ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO'VE BEEN TOUCHED BY THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. EDUCATION VOCATIONAL TRAINING DEVELOPED OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS LEAVES THE PRODUCTIVE CAREER PATHS WHICH IN TURN REDUCES RECIDIVISM AND FUTURE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE JUVENILE FACILITIES PROVIDE POST SECONDARY PROGRAMS FOR THESE USED AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS BILL. STATUTES ONLY REQUIRES THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND DIVISION OF JUVENILE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE A FULL HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM TO YOUTH AND KATHY WHO HAVE NOT COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR C. WITH PROVIDE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN CUSTODY. STATE REGULATIONS DO REQUIRE COUNTY PROBATION TO ENSURE THAT ALL YOU THEIR FACILITIES ARE TREATED EQUALLY WITH REGARD TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ADDITIONALLY THE USE BILL OF RIGHTS STATES THAT YOUTH IN DJ AT THE STILL OF THESE HAVE THE RIGHT. TO RECEIVE A QUALITY EDUCATION. THE YOU BILL OF RIGHTS DOES NOT PLACE AN AGE OF GRADE LEVEL LIMITATION ON THESE RIGHTS WE ARE AWARE OF THE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AND ARE HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH INVESTED PARTIES. TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS RAISED -- IN THE ANALYSIS VERY BRIEFLY THEY TALK ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE THE BILL SAYS A FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES WE GET THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE MY GOAL IS FOR THIS BILL. TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OFFERING -- AT A RATE OF OF ACADEMIC OR JOB READINESS CLASSES THAT GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE KENNEDY PROVIDES WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET TO SOME LANGUAGE THAT WE THINK WILL. MEET THE GOAL OF THE BILL BUT ALSO BE REALISTIC. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THE TOOLS THESE YOUNG PEOPLE NEED IN ORDER TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL AND CAN TRULY MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY UPON THEIR RELEASE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DANIELLE KASEY SO COMPOSTED AT THE COLLEGE OF SAN MATTEO.

WHEN I WAS AT THE BOYS RANCH I RECEIVED MY GED I WAS? SIXTEEN EARLY AFTER I TURNED SEVENTEEN I WAS FINISHING UP MY SENTENCE IN THE JUVENILE HALL. MOST OF MY DAYS DURING THOSE SEVEN TO EIGHT MONTHS WERE SPENT NOT LOOKING FOR TOO MUCH. I FEEL LIKE THAT TIME COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT CONTINUING MY EDUCATION AND PREPARING ME -- TO MOVE FORWARD WITH MY LIFE WHEN I GOT OUT. INSTEAD I GOT OUT A LITTLE BEFORE MY EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY -- AND I WAS UNPREPARED FOR THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AND NOT READY FOR THE TRANSITION BACK TO THE COMMUNITY.

ABOUT THE SEVEN TO EIGHT MONTHS THAT HE SPENT IN CUSTODY WITH NOTHING TO DO ACADEMICALLY WITH THE COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL G. ET. HIS EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE. THERE'S A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH IN CUSTODY IN JUVENILE FACILITIES WHO HAVE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS OR EQUIVALENCY. AB TWENTY THREE OH SIX WHICH BECAME LAW ON TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALLOWS YOUTH WITH JUVENILE JUSTICE EXPERIENCE. TO COMPLETE THEIR DIPLOMA WHEN THEY MEET THE STATE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.

THE PERCENTAGE IS AS HIGH AS 50% OR MORE IN THE STATE RUN FACILITIES WE HEAR ANECDOTALLY THAT IS 10215% IN SOME COUNTY FACILITIES BUT I RECENTLY VISITED. ONE WHERE FIVE OF THE EIGHTEEN YOUTH IN CUSTODY HAD THEIR DIPLOMAS AND NO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR THEM. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE OR ARE DEVELOPING. POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH IN CUSTODY. THESE MODEL PROGRAMS ARE FOUNDED ON CLOSE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN PROBATION. AND OR THE DJJ AND THE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OFFERING THE AND THEY OFFER ONSITE AND ONLINE CLASSES AND THEY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THIS SAFELY USING TECHNOLOGY. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO RE ENVISION THEMSELVES AND THEIR FUTURES.

AND THIS IS ITEM -- TWELVE SB. FOUR THREE THREE I AM. PROUD OF HIM. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I HAVE A COUPLE OF WITNESSES GETTING SITUATED HERE BUT I WILL BEGIN -- I'M HERE TODAY 2% SENATE BILL FOUR THREE THREE WHICH WILL ESTABLISH A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM FOR THREE TO FIVE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. TO CREATE OFFICES OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT IN DIVERSION. THESE OFFICES WILL BE MODELED IN PART AFTER LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S NEWLY CREATED OFFICE OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSION. AND ALLOW PARTICIPATING COUNTIES TO EXPLORE PUBLIC HEALTH CENTERED APPROACHES TO YOUTH JUSTICE ISSUES. WHEN YOU THINK CALIFORNIA ARRESTED FOR LOW LEVEL OFFENSES IN FORCE INTO INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? THEY'RE OFTEN INFLICTED WITH FURTHER HARM IN AN INCREASED RISK OF RECIDIVISM. JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY CHILDREN OF COLOR. FOSTER CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHO IDENTIFY AS LGBT Q. AND ARE OFTEN IN OFTEN COME FROM BACKGROUNDS WHERE THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO ABUSE ABANDONMENT NEGLECT TRAUMA AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THAT INFLUENCE THEIR BEHAVIOR. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT PREPARED OR DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES IN RESEARCH RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. THAT A RIMINOLOGICAL APPROACH TO DEALING WITH JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH TYPICALLY DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES. THAT DRIVE A YOUNG PERSON TO OFFEND. SB FOUR THREE THREE WILL ALLOW MORE NO MORE THAN FIVE INTERESTED PILOT COUNTIES TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THESE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. THROUGH TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY RELEVANT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE AGE APPROPRIATE AND THAT EMPHASIZE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. THE PILOT OFFICES OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT VERSION WILL ACT AS THE CENTRAL POINT OF COORDINATION FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COUNTY AGENCIES AND WILL WORK TO BLAND EXISTING COUNTY HEALTH SERVICES. AND COMMUNITY BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS TO BETTER ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ON JUSTICE INVOLVED USE. MEMBERS THIS MEASURE IS A VOLUNTARY AND TIME LIMITED PILOT PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW A HANDFUL OF COUNTIES TO EXPLORE NEW PATHWAYS IN ADDRESSING YOUTH JUSTICE ISSUES THROUGH A PUBLIC HEALTH LANDS. ACID YOU JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING OUR JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH. WITH COUNSELING AND SERVICES INSTEAD OF HAND CUFFS IN JAIL CELLS. IN -- CHEN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND MADAM CHAIR WITH YOUR PERMISSION WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I HAVE TWO IN ONE ON STAND BY CERTAINLY. PROCEED WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK. MY NAME IS AMY COHEN I AM HUNGRY TRAIN CHILD PSYCHIATRIST WITH THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRY. TREATING FAMILIES IN CHILDREN IN HIGHLY STRESSED INFORMATICS CIRCUMSTANCES. THE CHILDREN I TREAT MOST OFTEN PRESENT WITH PROBLEMS OF BEHAVIOR BEHAVIOR SOMETIMES DANGEROUS TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. I'VE ALSO SERVED AS LEAD PSYCHIATRIST ALAMEDA COUNTY JUVENILE HALL WHERE I CREATED A CONSULTATION SERVICE FOR SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES. COLLABORATED WITH PROBATION COLLEAGUES AND WORK DALY AND DIRECTLY WITH HUNDREDS OF INCARCERATED CHILDREN. I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO PASS SB. FOUR THIRTY THREE TO ESTABLISH ROBUST DIVERSION PROGRAMMING FOR HIGH RISK CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING THEM OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. PROGRAMMING WHICH WILL UTILIZE THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP AND RESOURCES. THE MERE ENTRY OF USE INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM INTO A CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM OF CONTAINMENT AND CONTROL. HAS BEEN SHOWN BY COUNTLESS STUDIES TO PRODUCE ITS OWN ADVERSE AND TRAUMATIZING AFFECTS. CHILDREN WHO ARE INCARCERATED OFTEN DETERIORATE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND MAYBE LESS AMENABLE TO SUBSEQUENT EFFORTS AT REHABILITATION. ENTRY OF CHILDREN INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY REDUCES THEIR CHANCES IN LIFE. CHILDREN WHO ENTER THE JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN THERE. INDEED CHILD INCARCERATION IS THE SINGLE GREATEST RISK FACTOR FOR ADULT INCARCERATION. EFFECTIVE DIVERSION IS A COMPLEX CHALLENGE AND I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PLACE THE ADMINISTRATION OF DIVERSION SERVICES AND THE HANDS OF THOSE WHOSE EXPERTISE QUALIFIES THEM TO TACKLE THIS COMPLEXITY. WE SHOULD BE PROFESSIONALS ALREADY TASKED WITH THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF CHILDREN THOSE FROM THOSE AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. THESE ARE THE PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN SHAPE PROGRAMMING AROUND THE UNDERSTANDING THE CHILDREN AT RISK HAVE OFTEN HAD NO ACCESS TO THE EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL. PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FAMILY SUPPORTS AVAILABLE TO MORE AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES. AND THAT THIS PAUCITY OF SERVICES OFTEN SETS THEM UP FOR FAILURE PROFESSIONALS WHO BRING TRAINING FOCUS AND EXPERTISE TO A SPECIALIZED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO CONNECT TO RESTORE AND INSPIRE KIDS. HOW TO TURN AROUND THOSE HEADING DOWN A BAD PATH? I SIT BEFORE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. IT IS MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION BOLSTERED BY SCHOLARLY DATA THAT NOT ONLY THE HEALTH OF OUR YOUTH BUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IS BEST SERVED BY COMMITMENT TO A THOUGHTFUL AND ROBUST DIVERSION PROGRAM OVERSEEN BY THOSE WHOSE EXPERTISE IS IN PROMOTING THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANNA JOHNSON AND I WAS A SCHOOL TEACHER FOR FOUR YEARS IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA AT IRVINE PROMISE ACADEMY IN THE FRUITVALE. WAS A TITLE ONE PUBLIC SCHOOL WE DO NOT HAVE A LIBRARIAN WE DID NOT HAVE A COUNSELOR OR ACADEMIC OR A THERAPEUTIC COUNSELOR WE DO NOT HAVE A SCHOOL NURSE WE DID NOT HAVE -- ANY SORT OF SUPPORTS OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM WAS CUT AND WE RELIED HEAVILY ON COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES TO SUPPORT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE EXPERIENCING CUTS TO THE LOCAL LIBRARY AND OTHER THINGS. AND THAT WAS -- THAT WAS A WHILE AGO BEFORE I BEGAN WORKING AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW BUT WHAT MY COLLEAGUES COULD DO WHEN THEY NEEDED HELP WITH THESE BEHAVIOR WAS RELY ONLY ON A DEAN OF STUDENTS. OR SOME PUNITIVE APPROACH WHICH DIDN'T REALLY ADDRESS WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE HUNGER THE CHILD WAS EXPERIENCING WITH THE IT THE EXPERIENCE OF VIOLENCE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE OF EXPERIENCE ON THE WALK TO SCHOOL. IT ACTUALLY WAS JUST NOT A SAFE PLACE AND WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAKE IT SAFE -- BUT THAT WAS JUST ON A LOCAL LEVEL BY THE TIME WE GOT EVERYTHING IN PLACE THAT WE NEEDED AT THAT SCHOOL WE FINALLY HAD EVERY CHILD WALK THE STAGE FOR GRADUATION. BUT IT TOOK THREE YEARS TO SET THAT UP -- WE'RE ASKING FOR A SAME APPROACH ON THE COMMUNITY LEVEL WHERE WE KNOW COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER SERVED AN UNDER FUNDED AND UNDER RESOURCE. AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS CHILD DEVELOPMENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT DOES A CHILD NEED TO SUCCEED AND BE HEALTHY AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS TO SET UP THAT PLAN. AND TO USE LOCAL RESOURCES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY INSUFFICIENTLY SPENT ON CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THE COME UP TO THE MIKE.

GOOD MORNING MICHELLE GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO IT WE BELIEVE IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT THESE CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE SERVED. WE HAVE A SUPPORT IN CONCEPT POSITION WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AUTHORS OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PILOTS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND BASED ON THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE SET FORTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY -- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND GIVE THEM A CHECK ONE OF THE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D DANIEL SANCHEZ WITH THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TODAY IN IN OPPOSITION I DO WANT TO THANK. SENATOR MONNING -- AND AND HIS STAFF IMMENSELY -- FOR MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS ON THIS BILL AND SO -- WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO TALK AND SO I JUST WANT TO EXTEND OUR APPRECIATION -- WE HAVE SHARED WITH THE AUTHOR AND AND THE SPONSOR -- CERTAINLY OUR AGREEMENT ON KIND OF A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT I THINK MANY OF THE THINGS THAT -- WERE RAISED HERE BY THE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS WE ARE VERY VERY MUCH AN AGREEMENT AND AND PROBATION IS VERY MUCH COMMITTED -- TO FACTORS SUCH AS POVERTY TRAUMA -- ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES HUNGER THESE ARE ALL VERY VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES -- THAT CERTAINLY IF ADDRESSED EARLY CAN LIMIT THEM FROM COMING INTO CONTACT WITH OUR JUSTICE THE AREA IN WHICH WE DISAGREE ON IS AND AND WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS IS REALLY THE APPROACH THAT THIS BILL TAKES -- IN COMBINING EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSION UNDER A NEW COUNTY ENTITY. TO PROVIDE FOR THESE DIVERSION SERVICES -- PROBATION OVER MANY MANY DECADES HAS INVESTED AND BUILD LINKAGES AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES -- WE'VE WORKED -- EXTENSIVELY WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TOWARD THIS END AND SO WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DATA TO SHOW THE PRECIPITOUS DECLINE ON THAT WE'VE HAD IN JUVENILE -- ARREST RATES DETENTION RATES AND ALSO DIVERSION FROM THE FRONT INTO THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED -- TO OUR PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AND DETERMINE TO BE EVIDENCE BASED AND SO ARE CONCERNED WITH MOVING AWAY FROM THIS WOULD BE THAT WE'RE GONNA. BE STEP AWAY FROM OUTCOMES -- AN INTRODUCTORY THAT WE KNOW IS WORKING -- I THINK PART OF THE CONCERN FOR US IS HAVING -- AGAIN KIND OF DUAL ENTITIES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL DOING BOTH DOING DIVERSION WORK -- AND THIS NEW ENTITY SET UP IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY -- INCORPORATE PROBATION I THINK WE EQUATE THIS TO A SIMILAR CONSTRUCT IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO STATE AGENCIES THAT WOULD BOTH HAVE THE SAME MISSION A RESPONSIBILITIES AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NOT ANY. LOTS OF EFFICIENCIES -- A DECLINE IN DELIVERY OF SERVICES ARE THINGS THAT WOULD IMPACT THE YOUTH -- THAT THAT POTENTIALLY NOW WOULD WOULD KIND OF COME UNDER THESE THESE TWO ENTITIES -- I THINK ONE OF THE STATED GOALS OF THE BILL IS TO MINIMIZE CONTACT WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WE BELIEVE IN A AN IMPORTANT WAY TO DO THIS WERE TO HAPPEN TO HAVE THIS BILL FOCUS ON TE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT SO. BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN ARRESTED BEFORE THEY'RE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM FOCUS ON AGAIN ALL OF THE ASPECTS THAT A FOR SUCCESSFUL THERE KEEP THEM FROM EVEN COMING. NEAR OR INTO. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM I THINK EEN AS A PILOT AGAIN BECAUSE OF KIND OF THESE DUPLICATIVE PARALLEL -- COUNTY ENTITIES WERE CONCERNED AGAIN -- THAT THERE'S POSSIBILITIES OF KIND OF THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS BEHAVIOR -- FOR YOUTH IN THE WAY THAT I THINK WE ALL WANT TO SEE -- SO AGAIN FOR US I THINK A BILL THAT FOCUSES ON THE FRONT END YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT -- WOULD MEET THE GOALS AND ULTIMATELY WOULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF OF SERVING IN KIND OF A DIVERSION CAPACITY WITHOUT IT CREATING -- A DUPLICATION OF COUNTY EFFORTS FOR NOW HAVING TO ENTITIES BOTH WORKING ON DIVERSION AND INSTEAD CONTINUE TO ALLOW PROBATION TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY -- COUNTY AGENCIES TO BEST DELIVER SERVICES AND HAVE THIS FOCUS ON THE VERY FRONT END OF THE SYSTEM -- SO WITH THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED AND AND AGAIN LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CENTER MORE LACK MANAGER -- THE SANCHEZ -- YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU ALREADY GOT METRICS THAT ARE SHOWING YOUR VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL SO I'M JUST CURIOUS CENTER MINING. WHAT MORE CAN WE DO THAT THIRTY BEING DONE? WITH THE KERN. WELL IT'S A FAIR QUESTION AND I ALSO WANNA OFFER MONEY. RESPECT FOR THE WORKER PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING CERTAINLY IN MY DISTRICT THERE'S BEEN SOME WONDERFULLY INNOVATIVE EFFORTS -- TO LOOK AT THE DIVERSION SIDE THAT SAID WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT WITH THESE PILOT PROGRAMS. IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH THROUGH A PUBLIC HEALTH GATEWAY WHERE THE CHILD IS NOT STIGMATIZED BY BEING PART OF A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- THAT DOES INVOLVE OFTEN BARS AND DETENTION FACILITIES EVEN WHERE THERE IS COLLABORATION WE ALSO BELIEVE I BELIEVE STRONGLY THIS WOULD NOT PRECLUDE IN THESE PILOTS COLLABORATION WITH THE PROBATION OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS IN FACT I THINK IT'S SUCCESS. WOULD BE ROOTED IN BUILDING THOSE PILLARS OF COLLABORATION WE THINK WE CAN LEARN SOME BEST PRACTICES FROM THE PUBLIC A HELP. PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH -- IN AS THE PROBATION -- DIVISIONS HAVE SAID GETTING TO THE FRONT END OF WHAT'S LANDING CHILDREN IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM -- IS EXACTLYWHAT THESE PILOTS CAN DO LOOKING AT SUPPORT SERVICES FOR FAMILIES EARLY IDENTIFICATION -- WHERE THERE'S PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS WITH PROBATION DEPARTMENT -- AND HOPEFULLY BEFORE THERE'S CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT -- WE THINK LOS ANGELES IS MAKING GOOD HEADWAY. LOS ANGELES COULD ALSO BE A BENEFICIARY. AS POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE PILOTS WERE WE WE LEARN FROM THEM AND DEVELOPING THE OTHERS. SO THIS WILL BE A GRANT PROGRAM IT WILL AND IT WILL BE TAKEN UP IN APPROPRIATIONS -- WHICH OF COURSE THIS IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE IT WOULD REQUIRE BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR IMPLEMENTATION THERE WERE WHAT KIND NUMBERS WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT A DEPARTMENT RIGHT A WHOLE NEW. ACTUALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT BUT YOUR SING WITH EXISTING COUNTY SERVICES -- WE'RE SEEKING TEN MILLION DOLLARS WE THINK THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PILOT. THREE TO FIVE COUNTIES VOLUNTARY IT'LL BE THE COUNTIES THAT STEP UP IN WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. FUNDING. THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU -- THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE I'M [inaudible] I I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I WOULD NOTE THAT. IS WE HAVE AN INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCE NOW WHERE -- THE NUMBER OF JUVENILES IN OUR COUNTY FCILITIES IS AN OUT ALL TIME LOW AND HAS BEEN GOING DOWN FOR TWENTY YEARS TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE COUNTIES IN ONLY A FIVE PEOPLE. IN THERE TOO LITTLE FACILITIES WHERE AS WE HAVE MADE WE THE STATE MADE HUGE INVESTMENTS. IN FUNDING THE COUNTIES TO EXPAND THESE FACILITIES WHICH ARE NOW COMPLETELY UNDER UTILIZED. AND AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WELL. OF HUGE. THE LARGE PORTION OF THAT DROP IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT. CRIME RATES AMONGST JUVENILES IS DOWN. THE OTHER PORTION IS BECAUSE WE DO DO DIVERSION PROGRAMS BUT INTERESTINGLY. WE HAVE AND WE I DON'T HAVE EXACT NUMBERS YET BUT I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR DATA. THERE ARE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE IN FOR MISDEMEANORS THAN I THINK MOST OF US WOULD BE PLEASED WITH. AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHY. AND IT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE% ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE THE PRESENCE OF DIVERSION PROGRAMS ARE NOT THERE COULD BE OTHER FACTORS. BUT CERTAINLY AS HE'S CRIME RATES GO DOWN I THINK WE I DON'T THINK WE REALLY ENVISIONED THESE FACILITIES PRIMARILY FOR MISDEMEANOR. AND I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE STATE. JUVENILE FACILITIES WHICH ARE. POPULATION IS DOWN ALSO ARE FOR CLEARLY SERIOUS SERIOUS OFFENDERS -- BUT REALLY LOW LEVEL YOU KNOW WE WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE -- HANDLING THEM IN WAYS OTHER THAN HOLDING THEM. SO -- WHETHER THIS BILL HELPS US TO GET AT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE MISDEMEANOR LOW LEVEL MISDEMEANORS IN OUR COUNTY FACILITIES -- I WOULD HOPE SO -- SO AS I INDICATED I AM SUPPORTIVE BUT I ALSO AM IN TERMS MY HAT AS BEING THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR. LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT WHAT THE STATE IS GIVING TO COUNTIES IN RELATIONSHIP TO JUVENILES BECAUSE OF HOW FEW JUVENILES ARE NOW IN COUNTY FACILITIES. AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS BEING SPENT PER JUVENILE IS VERY VERY HIGH IN SANTA CLEAR THE RECENT NUMBERS WERE. FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND ABOUT -- FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN SOMEWHERE UP WERE OVER FIVE HUNDRED K. PER JUVENILE -- ANYWAY SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BUT CERTAINLY THE OBJECTIVE. OF INTERVENTIONS WITH JUVENILES SO THAT. WE CAN PREVENT THEM FROM. WHICH IS THE WE CAN. PUT THEM ON A GOOD PATH IS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND THIS IS A PILOT SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. CENTER MORE LACK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- COMING FROM COUNTY LAND. AND APPRECIATING WHAT PROBATION DEPARTMENTS DO AND LOOKING AT THE DATA AND SEEING HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY HAVE BEEN. I'M I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS AND REMINDING OF OF ADDING MORE COST -- AND IT OUT I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO PROBATION DEPARTMENTS FOR SOME INCREDIBLE DATA THAT THAT WE HAVE A AND BECAUSE COUNTIES TEND TO HAVE DEPARTMENTS THAT OPERATE IN SILOS. IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE SOME MORE CROSS TRAINING IF I COULD USE SOME KIND OF TERM. WHERE WE WORK TOGETHER BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS HELP IT CETERA -- IN MAYBE IT FIRST START WITH DEVELOPING A PROGRAM AND DO SOME. CROSS POLLINATION FIRST BEFORE WE SET UP OF A PILOT PROGRAM ZABI OPPOSE TODAY. BUT I'LL BE WATCH UNDERSTAND OF THROUGH THERE IF I COULD JUST RESPOND TO THAT I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN BUT I THINK. THE STATISTIC SHARED BY THE CHAIR POINT. TO NOT ONLY SUCCESS OF PROBATION AND JUVENILE JUSTICE SERVICES TO A POINT BUT ALSO THE THE HIGH COST OF THAT PATH OF FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PER INCARCERATED USE. IF IF FOR A FRACTION OF THAT WERE INVESTED IN SUCCESSFUL ON PUBLIC HEALTH SOCIAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMS A FEW YEARS AGO I WORKED WITH. THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL COMMA HARRIS ANA LOOKING AT USE WHO WERE FOUND TO BE TRUANT IN PROSECUTIONS OF PARENTS FOR TRUANT USE. IN GETTING THEM OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WHERE THERE'S CHRONIC TRUANCY THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON LET'S TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND I THINK THIS BUILDS ON THAT SAME PHILOSOPHY. AND I THINK A BROADER PHILOSOPHY IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM OF SEEING. MANY OF THE STARTERS IS BEING SOCIAL MEDICAL ISSUES NOT CRIME PER SE NOT CRIMINAL INDIVIDUALS SO -- I THINK. THIS DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE BUILDING SILENCE I THINK THE PILOTS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM WILL BE THOSE THAT INTEGRATE EXISTING SERVICES. DRAWN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LINK FAMILIES TO BEHAVIOR HEALTH WHERE APPROPRIATE -- MAYBE IT'S AS SIMPLE AS PRIMARY CARE MAYBE THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THE VISION OF THESE PILOTS IS THEY DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING. THAT PROBATION THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND SCHOOLS CAN LEARN FROM SO THAT'S THAT'S THE INITIATIVE HERE WE THINK IN THE LONG RUN COST SAVING. IN MAYBE SO I SIT THERE SENATOR MITCHELL HAS IT AND THEN -- UNLESS THERE'S OTHER DISCUSSION AFTER YOU ANSWER SENATOR MITCHELL'S IF THERE IS AN ANSWER YOU CAN CLOSE GO AHEAD CENTER MITCHELL AND THAT I THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN CANCELED THANK YOU. QUICK QUESTION SENATOR MINING IS THIS -- WORKING IN CONCERT. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ON BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH REGARD TO MOVING. ON DJJ INTO -- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY YOU SEE THESE. WELL IN CONCERT YES IN FACT -- WE ARE LOOKING -- AT MOVING THIS TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THE CURRENT BILL DRAFTED.

RIGHT TO THE MOTION BEFORE US IS TO PASSED RULES SENATOR MORNING DO YOU WANT. TO CLOSE. I JUST THINK THE COMMITTEE. FOR INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK OUR WITNESSES LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PROBATION AND OTHER. STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR COUNTY SO I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION LET'S TO ROLL CALL. SKINNER BY SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. ROCK NO BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL. MITCHELL I'M AROUND. WIENER I MEAN OR I SORRY WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN -- BUT IT LOOKS GOOD. BUT WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN AND WILL NOW GO TO ITEMS SIXTEEN SB FIVE EIGHTY MISTER WELL IT'S KIND. BREITBART WHILE SENATOR WORKS ON THE WAY LET'S DO MOTION ON SENATOR BATES BILL. YES YES I KNOW HE'S COMING TO THE TABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT WE WANTED TO DO A MOTION ON BATES BILL THAT WE KNEW WE DIDN'T HAVE A QUORUM IN THE ROOM ALSO. ALRIGHT SO LET'S -- IT'S DO PASS AS AMENDED. I'M SENATOR BATES SO WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL ON THAT. THE PAST AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER ALL RIGHT SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD. I FOR AYE JACKSON MITCHELL. THE BATES AS AMENDED. MITCHELL AYE MORRELL WIENER. WIENER HIGH. GREAT SO WILL HOLD THAT OPEN ALSO AND WE WILL NOW HAVE SENATOR WHAT PRESENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB FIVE EIGHTY THE ANIMAL CRUELTY AND VIOLENCE INTERVENTION ACTS. THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL HELP DIFFERENT PREVENT SOME OF THE MOST HORRIFIC AND TRAGIC ACCIDENT ACTS OF CRUELTY AND VIOLENCE. THERE IS A PROVEN LINK BETWEEN ANIMAL ABUSE AND AND LATER VIOLENCE TOWARDS PEOPLE. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. THOSE WHO ABUSE ANIMALS GOING TO COMMIT MUCH MORE SERIOUS ACTS OF AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE LATER IN LIFE. 90% OF ALL MASS MURDERS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN 50% OF A CONVICTEDRAPIST ALL STARTED% WITH ANIMAL ABUSE. SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE INTERVENE EARLY AND PREVENT ANIMAL ABUSE OFFENDERS FROM PROGRESSING TOO MUCH WORSE AND MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES. THE SB FIVE EIGHTY WILL REQUIRE THE MOST SERIOUS ANIMAL ABUSE OFFENDERS TO UNDERGO A MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION. AND TO UNDERGO ANY NECESSARY COUNSELING OR TREATMENT AT THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE. THIS BILL ALSO PERMITS JUDGES TO SIGN A NUMBER OF APPROVED HUMANE EDUCATION COURSES FOR OFFENDERS GRANTED PROBATION FOR LESS SERIOUS OFFENSE. TO LESSEN THE LACK LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE. SB FIVE EIGHTY MAINTAINS JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO SIGN THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENTS COUNSELING OR EDUCATION AS NECESSARY -- INTO ANIMAL ABUSE OFFENDERS PREVENT FUTURE CRUELTY AND VIOLENCE TO BOTH ANIMALS AND PEOPLE. I AM AWARE THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND WE'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING LETTER -- LATER AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS IN THAT THE EVALUATION WILL ONLY BE USED FOR THIS SPECIFIC -- PURPOSE. ALSO WE'RE WORKING TO IDENTIFY THE MOST APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY TO CERTIFY THE EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING TO WHICH IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE BODY. TO TO MANAGE THIS WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE LYNSEY LARISA WITH THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. CERTAINLY GO AHEAD YOU CENTER WILK -- GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON AND COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ONE TWO HOURS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND. AND ARE MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF SUPPORTERS AT SENATE BILL. FIVE EIGHTY THE ANIMAL CRUELTY AND VIOLENCE INTERVENTION ACT EMPOWERS COURTS OF KEY TOOL TO HELP REHABILITATE CONVICTED AND ABUSERS IN ORDER TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND TO ACTUALLY PREVENT FUTURE VIOLENCE TOWARD ANIMALS AND PEOPLE BEFORE IT HAPPENS. AS SENATOR WEALTH MENTIONED OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS STUDIES SHOWING THIS LINK BETWEEN ANIMAL VIOLENCE AND VIOLENCE HUMANS. I'M IN FACT MOST WOMEN ENTERING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS REPORT THAT THEIR VIEWS ARE ALSO KILLED OR HARMED OR THREATENED TO KILL HER FAMILY PAT. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS LINK EXISTS THIRTY TWO STATES CURRENTLY HAVE LEGISLATION THE OTHER PERMITS -- REQUIRES SOME LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING AS PERFORATION UNDER SENTENCING IN CASE OF ANIMAL ABUSE INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE THAT SB FIVE EIGHTY IS IMPORTANT EXCEPT FOR CALIFORNIA IN COMBAT IN THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE ALSO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY REHABILITATIVE AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. TO HELP OFFENDERS FROM RE OFFENDING. SB FIVE EIGHTY DOES TWO IMPORTANT THINGS INSURERS OFFENDERS OF ANIMAL CRUELTY CRIMES THAT HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. RECEIVE THE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION AND GIVE JUDGES AN APPROPRIATE TOOL LARGEST SIDE WHICH EVALUATION WHICH COUNSELING IF ANY IS THE APPROPRIATE COUNSELING. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH UNDER FIVE NINE SEVEN H.. AND THIS MAY BE OVER INCLUSIVE AND MAY INCLUDE OFFENDERS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING WE ALSO ARE NOT SURE AT THIS POINT WHERE THOSE OFFENDERS ARE GOING. OR IF THAT COUNTS IS APPROPRIATE. WITH FIVE EIGHTY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE OFFENDER. AND YOU LOOK AND A CLINICIAN CAN MAKE A KEY RECOMMENDATION ABOUT THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE TYPE OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION. SB FIVE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE JUDGES WITHIN A VALUATION REPORT. THE JUDGE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION WITH THE INPUT OF A PROFESSIONAL AS TO WHAT TYPE OF COUNSELING IF ANY MAKES SENSE FOR A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. RESEARCH IN THE FIELD HAS SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS WITH THAT TYPE OF COUNSELING KNOWN AS MORAL WRECK RECONNAISSANCE. THERAPY MRT WHICH HAS A SEEKS TO DECREASE RECIDIVISM AMONG BOTH JUVENILE AND ADULT CRIMINAL OFFENDERS BY INCREASING MORAL REASONING THROUGH VARIATION OF THE WELL KNOWN. CBT COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY APPROACH. WELL THIS IS RELATIVELY NEW FIELD OF STUDY THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE THAT THIS TYPE OF THERAPY DOES REDUCE RECIDIVISM. I MARTINEZ UP AS ONE TYPE OF TREATMENT AVAILABLE BUT ANIMAL ABUSE CAN BE CONNECTED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. AND THERE'S A WIDE MEN -- ARRAY OF PROFESSIONALS THAT CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. WITH THE RANGE OF UNDERLYING ISSUES MANIFESTING IN THE CRIME OF ANIMAL ABUSE IT'S LOGICAL FOR THE REHABILITATION OF THE OFFENDER AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC THAT A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL IS INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS WITH THE COURT -- THIS BILL ALSO WILL GIVE JUDGES COMMUNICATION COURSES AS CENTER WEALTH MENTIONED. TO THE BROADER SPECTRUM OF ANIMAL CRUELTY CRIMES WELL SOME OFFENDERS MIGHT HAVE UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SOME OFFENDERS CAN BE BETTER READABILITY IT THROUGH HUMANE EDUCATION. THIS IS THE CASE WHEN THERE ARE THINGS LIKE NEGLECT WHERE SOMEBODY JUST MIGHT NOT KNOW. WHAT THEY'VE DONE WRONG AND WITHOUT THIS EDUCATION THEY'RE LIKELY TO RE OFFEND THESE COURSES WILL ENCOURAGE EMPATHY AND PROMOTE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED FOR COMPASSION RESPECT FOR ANIMALS. AND AGAIN THIS IS A COMPLETELY AT THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION WE DID TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS LAST YEAR AND MAJOR THIS BILL A LOT OF THE JUDGES HAVE MORE DISCRETION IN BOTH OF THESE TREATMENTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE IN EITHER THE THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE WITHDRAWING OUR OPPOSITION GIVEN THEM OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR [inaudible] GREAT. I'M IN CENTER WORK ON A NOTE THAT TIME. YOU ARE -- GOOD TO BE PERSISTENT. AND BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WE DO KNOW THAT. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CRUEL TO ANIMALS AS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT ARE AND TEN TO THEN OUTSIDE DISPLAY OTHER -- BEHAVIORS THAT -- CAN BE CRIMINAL IN NATURE -- WE'VE HAD BILLS -- YOU HAVE BROUGHT US BILLS BEFORE THAT WERE MUCH BROADER AND HARDER FOR EXAMPLE FOR ME IS THAT YOUR TO SUPPORT. BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE NARROWING THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS BILL I THINK YOU'VE HIT. ON A GOOD BALANCE. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING.

MITCHELL AYE MOREAU WIENER. WIENER AYE. ALRIGHT WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN BECAUSE WE'RE MISSING SOME MEMBERS BUT IT'S LOOKING GOOD. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE WITHOUT ANOTHER AUTHOR HERE SENATOR WIENER DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD. ON SB RIGHT [inaudible] NUMBER [inaudible] YEAH OKAY. THE CARD WITHOUT. YEAH AND OUR STAFF WILL. DON'T WORRY WE WILL MAKE SURE TO HEAR FROM YOUR WITNESSES IF YOU WANT TO START [inaudible] RIGHT GREAT. OKAY I THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- HIS [inaudible] BIGGEST -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CEREMONY THANK YOU ARE YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING. WITH US ON THIS BILL -- COLLEAGUES -- SB -- ONE FORTY FIVE WILL FINALLY PUT AND AND TO CALIFORNIA'S HIGHLY -- DISCRIMINATORY -- AND ANTI LGBT -- TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC SEX ACTS BY OUR SECOND STATES SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY -- BY ENSURING THAT ALL FORMS OF INTERCOURSE ARE TREATED THE SAME UNDER THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. AS OPPOSED TO THE WAY IT IS NOW WHERE AS WERE -- VAGINAL -- PENILE INTERCOURSE IS TREATED MUCH LESS HARSHLY THAN OTHER FORMS OF INTERCOURSE IT'S IRRATIONAL -- IT HAS ABSOLUTELY THERE'S NO WAY OF REALLY EXPLAINING IT -- AND IT RESULTS IN INCREDIBLY BIZARRE -- AND UNFAIR AND DISCRIMINATORY OUR RESULTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW. IF -- AND ADULTS HAS -- CONSENSUAL. VAGINAL INTERCOURSE WITH A MINOR AGE FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN THIS IS NOT BROUGHT TIME ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AND ABOUT IT THOUGH IT IS NO MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLDER. THAN THE MINOR AGE -- FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN THE OFFENSE IS NOT A REGISTER ROLL OFFENSE. THE COURT HAS THE DISCRETION TO DECIDE BASED ON THE FACTS OF THE CASE WHETHER TO PUT SOMEONE ON THE REGISTRY. BUT THE COURT IS NOT REQUIRED TO DO SO. THAT IS CURRENT LAW IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE OTHER HAND. IF TE SAME EXACT SITUATION OCCURS AN ADULT HAS SEX WITH A FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD AND IS NO MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLDER. BUT IF THE INTERCOURSE INSTEAD OF BEING VAGINAL IS SOMETHING ELSE A ORAL OR ANAL SEX. I'VE BEEN THE COURT IS MANDATED TO PLACE THE OFFENDER. ON THE REGISTRY. NO MATTER WHAT. THESE THE REASON THAT THIS DISTINCTION EXISTS OF COURSE IS THAT WHEN THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY WAS CREATED IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES -- ALL FORMS OF ENTERS INTERCOURSE OTHER THAN VAGINAL INTERCOURSE WERE ILLEGAL -- WALLED IN ALL THOSE OTHER FORMS OF INTERCOURSE WERE LEGALIZED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE REGISTRY WAS NEVER CHANGE -- SO AS A RESULT -- WE SEE VERY. PROBLEMATIC RESULTS FIRST OF ALL THIS INTENSELY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST LGBT YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE BY AND LARGE WHEN LGBT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HAVING SEX -- THEY CANNOT HAVE PENILE VAGINAL SEX. AND SO WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE IT'S AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BOY. HAS VAGINAL SEX WITH A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLFRIEND IT'S A CRIME. BUT HE IS NOT A CORE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PUT HIM ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. BY CONTRAST IF AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BOY HAS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOYFRIEND. THE COURT MUST PUT HIM ON THE REGISTRY AND POTENTIALLY RUIN HIS LIFE. OF THESE LAWS ARE A RELIC OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMOPHOBIC PAST. BUT IT'S NOT JUST LGBT PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED. IF YOU ARE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BOY. HAVING SEX BATTLE SUCKS WITH YOUR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLFRIEND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO IN THE REGISTRY. IF SHE PERFORMED ORAL SEX ON HIM. HE'S REQUIRED THE COR HAS NO DISCRETION MUST PUT HIM ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. SO IN ADDITION TO DISCRIMINATING AGAINST LGBT PEOPLE THIS CREATES THIS BIZARRE IRRATIONAL -- JUST AWFUL DISTINCTION THAT HAD SERVES NO PUBLIC POLICY PURPOSE. THIS LAW WILL SIMPLY. GET RID OF THAT DISTINCTION TO TREAT ALL FORMS OF INTERCOURSE IN THIS. AGE BRACKET THE SAME WAY THAT WE HAVE LONG TREATED. VAGINAL INTERCOURSE PERIOD WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEW STRUCTURE. WORKS AS TREATING ALL FORMS OF INTERCOURSE ON A NOTE THAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE HAWKS ARE CASE ORRECTLY STRUCK DOWN THIS DISTINCTION AS AN EQUAL PROTECTION VIOLATION. FOR REASONS I WILL NEVER UNDERSTANDS AND TWENTY FIFTEEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED THAT DECISION. AND DECIDED THAT IT WAS OKAY TO DISCRIMINATE HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT COURT WAS DEAD WRONG AND IT'S THIS LEGISLATURE'S JOB TO CORRECT THAT -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- WE HAVE A BROAD COALITION SUPPORTING THIS BILL. INCLUDING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CAL CASA WHICH ADVOCATES FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. A AND A BROAD COALITION OF LGBT ORGANIZATIONS WITH ME TODAY TESTIFIED. NOW IS A BROADLY MCCARTY FROM THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ARE DOING AS WELL BY DOWN PHYLLIS SADO. ON TAMMY MARTIN FROM QUALITY CALIFORNIA OUR SPONSORS ARE THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND QUALITY CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. GREAT SO WE'LL HAVE TO WITNESSES TALKED WITH THE YOU KNOW. TAKE A LITTLE TIME IN THE OTHERS JUST. ADD ON THE GO AHEAD WHICHEVER IF YOU WANT TO START. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRPERSON COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- I'VE SPOKEN -- TO MANY OF YOU BEFORE -- ON MY TIERED SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION BILL WHICH SENATOR -- WIENER WAS THE AUTHOR OF I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT IS RATHER SURPRISING THAT I'M HERE SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT. THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE WENT IN A TIME MACHINE AND PULLED SOMETHING OUT THAT I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE STILL EXIST ON THE BOOKS OF OUR PENAL CODE -- I GIVE A LOT OF SPEECHES ABOUT THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION LAWS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WERE WRITTEN IN. NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN AND THEY WERE RETROACTIVE. TO NINETEEN FORTY FOUR I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY HAD A TIME CAPSULE IN HIGH SCHOOL IN THE FORTIES AND PUT THIS LAW IN IT AND WE JUST OPENED IT. SHOCKED THAT IT ACTUALLY EVER WAS ON THE BOOKS -- I AM A TWENTY FOUR YEAR VETERAN OF THE LA DA'S OFFICE. I AM A CURSE SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR. I ACT AS OUR EXPERT ON SEX OFFENDER RECIDIVISM SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND MULTI DISSIMILAR MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I CAN TELL YOU FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT. THAT. WE HAVE TO DO OUR JOBS WITH SOME EFFICACY [inaudible] AND WHEN I HAVE A CASE COME IN. THAT FALLS UNDER THESE CODE SECTIONS AND I HAVE NON PREDATORY BEHAVIOR AND I VOLUNTARY SEX ACTS BETWEEN. TWO YOUNG PEOPLE [inaudible] THE I'M NOT GOING CHARGE. THESE OFFENSES [inaudible] BECAUSE THE COURT GOT IT RIGHT. IN HARSHER. THEY GOT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME THEN THEY GOT IT RIGHT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN COURT RULING AFTER COURT RULING. THAT IN FORCING REGISTRATION ON THESE OFFENSES IS FLAT OUT OF VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION. NOW THE JOHNSON CASE RELIED ON AN IRRATIONAL TECHNICALITY HAVING TO DO WITH EQUAL PROTECTION REVIEW. IN OVERTURNING HARSHER HIGHER. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE SPIRIT OF THAT RULING. THAT MAKES ANY SENSE. IT OVERTURNED IS SAYING WE CAN FIND A DISTINGUISHABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE ACTS AND PENILE VAGINAL INTERCOURSE AND THAT IS. THAT ONE CAN RESULT IN PREGNANCY. AND THE OTHERS CANNOT. SEEMS RATHER COUNTERINTUITIVE DOESN'T IT. YOU CAN IMPOSE WHAT IS ACTUALLY UNDER THE CODE SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. ON STAT RAPE. AND IT'S NOT REGISTRABLE BUT OFFENSES THAT CANNOT RESULT IN THAT. RECEIVE WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A HARSHER PENALTY. THE DAY IN FACT -- REGISTRABLE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK. AT THE ACTUAL PURPOSE OF THE REGISTRY REMEMBER IT'S NOT THE PUNISHMENT FOR THE CRIME. IT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAS TO DO WITH CRIME SOLVING AND KEEPING TRACK OF PREDATORS. WHEN YOU REQUIRE SOMEBODY TO REGISTER FOR AN OFFENSE THAT IS NOT PREDATORY THAT THE PERSON HAS LITTLE TO NO RISK OF RE OFFENSE? YOU START A CHAIN REACTION. NUMBER ONE THAT STARTS WITH THE PROSECUTION OF THE CASE. TRIALS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY BECAUSE SOMEONE IS NOT GOING TO PLEAD TO THESE OFFENSES. GIVEN THE REGISTRATION IF SOMEONE IS CONVICTED. YOU HAVE SOMEONE GOING IN AND IT TAKES THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO REGISTER SOMEONE FOR ONE OF THESE OFFENSES. AS IT TAKES TO REGISTER A SERIAL RAPIST OR SERIAL CHILD MOLESTER. THAT MEANS A POLICE OFFICER IN EVERY CITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS SITTING SPENDING THEIR TIME. REGISTERING ONE OF THESE NO RISK OFFENDERS RATHER THAN FOLLOWING AROUND A NEWLY RELEASED SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR. OR DOING COMPLIANCE CHECKS WHICH THEY SHOULD BE DOING FOR OTHER HIGH RISK REGISTRANT IT IS BEEN pENFORCEMENT RESOURCES ON SEX OFFENDERS. IS DEVOTED. TWO REGISTRANT JUST THE PAPERWORK. FOR NO RISK TO LOW RISK OFFENDERS. IT ISN'T SIMPLY A MATTER OF FAIRNESS. IT'S A MATTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY. I WILL CLOSE WITH ONE EXAMPLE WHILE I WORKED IN A CHILDREN'S ASSAULT CLINIC CALLED STEWART HOUSE OUT OF THE RAPE TREATMENT CENTER SANTA MONICA. ONE OF THE LAST CASES I HANDLED. WAS THAT OF A PARENT CALLING THE POLICE. BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER WHO WAS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL ON THE BASKETBALL TEAM. WAS IN A CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP. WITH A FELLOW HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. AND THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT SHE WAS. EIGHTEEN THE MOTHER WAS DEVOUTLY RELIGIOUS. AND SHE FELT THAT BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER WAS IN A SAME SEX RELATIONSHIP. IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FAULT OF THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD. THEREFORE SHE CALLED THE POLICE. AND THAT CASE WAS INVESTIGATED. AND THAT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BAN HAS. POLICE DOCUMENTS POLICE REPORTS RECORDING THIS ALLEGED CRIME. THE MOTHER THEN CALLED THE UC SCHOOL. WHERE THE GIRL HAD GOTTEN A FULL SCHOLARSHIP? AND BECAUSE THE GIRL HAD USED ARE YOU SEE E. MAIL THAT SHE RECEIVED FOR HER NEXT INCOMING FRESHMAN YEAR. IN SENDING AN INNOCUOUS EMAIL TO THE DAUGHTER. MANAGED TO GET THE SCHOLARSHIP RESCINDED. DO YOU SEE SCHOOL. SO THE DAUGHTER [inaudible] AND AND THE DAUGHTER. IT WAS THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WAS ACTUALLY THE PERSON WHO ASKED THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD OUT ON THEIR FIRST DATE. THEY WERE IN A LOVING COMBINED RELATIONSHIP. AND IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF THIS MOTHER'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. AND THE FACT THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD PREVENT HER DAUGHTER FROM BEING GAY. BY TAKING OUT HER REVENGE ON THIS EXEMPLARY EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD. THAT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS LIFE WAS ALREADY RAW AND I COULDN'T STOP THE SCHOLARSHIP FROM BEING RECENT IT I COULDN'T STOP HER FROM GETTING IN TROUBLE AT SCHOOL AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT EXPELLING HER. THE ONE THING I WAS ABLE TO STOP. WAS THAT SHE WAS NOT PROSECUTED SO SHE DIDN'T BECOME A SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. AND IF I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP THAT. THE REST OF HER LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TAMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA WHICH FOR TWENTY YEARS HAS LED THE EAGLE IN THE STATE'S FIGHT FOR FULL LGBT Q. EQUALITY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR OF SB. ONE FORTY FIVE WHICH WILL ADDRESS ONE HIGHLY DISCRIMINATORY WAY THAT OUR STATE'S LAWS STREET LGBT Q. YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY CRIMINALIZED EVEN FOR A CONSENSUAL ACTIVITY? A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NATIONAL STUDY OF FORTY THOUSAND STATUTORY RAPE RECORDS FOUND THE INCIDENTS INVOLVING SAME SEX SEXUAL ACTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO RESULT IN A REST. AND MORE SO WHEN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP. THOSE RESULTS LED THE STUDY'S AUTHORS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ARRESTS WERE DRIVEN BY INVALID FACTORS SUCH AS PARENTS' DISCOMFORT WITH THE MERE THOUGHT OF THEIR CHILD BEING IN A SAME SEX RELATIONSHIP. WHEN YOUNG LGBT Q. PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN CERTAIN TYPES OF VOLUNTARY INTERCOURSE ENTER THE COURTS IN THIS CONTEXT? JUDGES UNDER CURRENT LAW ARE NOT GRANTED THE SAME DISCRETION TO DETERMINE. BASED ON THE FACTS OF THE CASE WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER. LAWS THAT UNJUSTIFIED WE TREAT CERTAIN TYPES OF INTERCOURSE AS MORE EGREGIOUS. THAN OTHERS OFTEN KNOWN AS SODOMY LAWS HAVE BEN ENACTED AND INVALIDATED THROUGHOUT OUR NATION'S HISTORY. THEY PRIMARILY TARGET PRIVATE INVOLUNTARY ACTS BETWEEN PEOPLE OF THE SAME GENDER AND ARE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO PREVENT NON POCREATIVE SEX AND SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE. SIMILARLY THE OUTDATED LAWS THAT SB ONE FORTY FIVE THAT SEEKS TO AMEND HAVE A DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT ON YOUNG LGBT Q. COUPLES. THEY ALSO HOWEVER PUT ALL YOUNG COUPLES WHO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF VOLUNTARY INTERCOURSE AT RISK OF IRRATIONALLY BEING PLACED ON THE REGISTRY. THIS BILL SIMPLY ALIGNS REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIED VOLUNTARY ACTS WITH OTHER EXISTING REQUIREMENTS. REGISTRATION FOR YOUNG LGBTQ PEOPLE WHO POSE NO RISK TO THEIR COMMUNITY. ONLY COMPOUNDS THE SOCIETAL BARRIERS THAT TO HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT THE LGBTQ PEOPLE ALREADY FACE. SB ONE FORTY FIVE IS A SENSIBLE AND NECESSARY BILL. WE THANK SENATOR WINNER FOR ADVANCING THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU CAN COME TO THE MIKE.

SEEING NONE WE CAN NOW HAVE OUR DISCUSSION. LIKE TO KNOW ALL RIGHT SO I I DO HAVE SOME COMMENTS [inaudible] I'M. SIR WIENER I WANNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COURAGE TO HAVE. BROUGHT THE BILL I THINK IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO NOW. THAT FIRST CORRECTED ARE SIX REGISTRY -- CALIFORNIA AND IN. SO OFTEN WE AS A STATE ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT WE OVER CORRECT. ANDWE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR ONE SIZE FITS ALL SIX REGISTRY RULES. WE REALLY PUT A TERRIBLE BURDEN ON NOT ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT ON PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. AND NO ONE HERE WANTS TO HAVE. SEXUAL PREDATORS VIOLENT SEXUAL OFFENDERS. ARE YOU KNOW OTHER CATEGORIES OF TO BE -- TO HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER KIDS OR WE WANT TO HAVE. THEM ON RIDGE STREET WE WANT TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT BE ABLE TO MONITOR THAT REGISTRY -- AND AS OUR WITNESS FROM LA COUNTY REFERENCE YOU WANT. TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REALLY -- WHEN WE SAY MONITOR MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOLKS ARE IN THE PLACE WHERE BECAUSE PART OF THE REGISTRY IS THAT YOU MUST INDICATE WHERE YOU LIVE AND ALL THOSE THINGS -- BY OUR RIDICULOUS ONE SIZE FITS ALL RULES AND BY NOW THIS DISCRIMINATORY AND I'M SURE THEY'RE STILL MORE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED. WE HAD SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE ARE NO LONGER IT WASN'T IT WAS NO LONGER REALLY USEFUL FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY POINT OF VIEW. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE SO I WANT TO REALLY THANK YOU. AND THEN THIS CORRECTION. IS ALSO ESSENTIAL BECAUSE WE HAVE SITUATION NOW WHILE THIS CORRECTION DOESN'T. IMPACT THIS PER SE. IF YOU'RE MANDATORY REPORTER WHICH TEACHERS ARE. AND YOU YOU CAN HAVE A LOT TO STUDENTS IN YOUR SENIOR CLASS THAT ARE. EIGHTEEN AND YOU CAN HAVE STUDENTS IN YOUR CLASSES THAT ARE IN SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS ONCE EIGHTEEN ONCE NOT. IN YOUR THEN IN THIS GRAY AREA IT'S IT BECAUSE TECHNICALLY UNDER THE LAW. IF A PERSON IS UNDER EIGHTEEN THEY ARE NOT CONSENSUAL. SO. AND NOW CLEARLY THIS DOESN'T REMOVE. THE ONUS ON A MANDATORY REPORTER BUT IT CERTAINLY. LIMIT THAT PROSECUTION ON THE SAME SEX -- INDIVIDUALS -- OR EVEN FOR THAT MATTER ON HETEROSEXUAL AND COUPLES BECAUSE OF THE BIZARRE DISTINCTION. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE CLINTON -- WHATEVER WILL LEAVE THAT ALONE LEWINSKI SIT CIRCUMSTANCE BUT SO WE HAVE THESE BIZARRE DISTINCTIONS WHICH REALLY GREW OUT OF A PREJUDICE AND HAVE NO. NO BEARING NOW SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS. I WOULD -- SAY THAT WE ALSO PROBABLY NEED TO CORRECT. IN THE FIRST BILL WHERE WE CREATED THE TEARS WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO BE. RE TIERED AUTOMATIC VERSUS THE INDIVIDUAL HAVING TO PETITION FOR IT SO MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT THAT IN THE FUTURE BUT TODAY WE ARE JUST DEALING WITH. CHANGING THIS DISCRIMINATORY TORY PRACTICE TOWARDS THE DEFINITION OF INTERCOURSE. AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT. AND YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND I KNOW TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE DID THE THE TEAR REGISTRY BECAUSE THESE KIDS THAT THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WHO HAS SEX WITH -- THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD -- AND HAS TO THEN GO ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY -- WERE AND THAT THAT WOULD BE A LIFETIME REGISTRY -- AND AND NOW -- ONCE THAT BUILD WE DID TWO YEARS AGO GOES INTO EFFECT ON IN A COUPLE YEARS -- TOO LONG BUT BETTER LATE THAN NEVER I'LL STILL BE A TEN YEAR REGISTRY. AND WHAT THIS BILL -- THIS BILL IS ABOUT A FEW THINGS IT'S ABOUT GETTING RID OF A HIGHLY IRRATIONAL -- DISTINCTION AND ON SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY -- DISTINCTION THAT AFFECTS REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THAT CAN REALLY RUIN PEOPLE'S LIVES -- BUT IS ALSO PART OF A BROADER EFFORT THEY WERE ENGAGING IN -- TO TRY TO KEEP OUR LGBT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SAFE AND THE SOCIETY TELLS LGBT YOUNG PEOPLE IN SO MANY WAYS WAYS WHETHER TEENAGERS OF CHILDREN. DECIDED TELLS AND THAT THEIR LIFE HAS NO VALUE -- THAT THEY ARE -- THAT THEY SHOULD JUST GO AWAY AND THAT'S WHY WE SEE THE OBSCENE SUICIDE RATES AMONG LGBT YOUTH. OBSCENE RATES OF BULLYING AND THEN WE SEE CRIMINALIZATION OF LGBT YOUNG PEOPLE AND AND WE WE GOT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT WE GOT TO KEEP THESE KIDS. SAVE WE HAVE TO CONVEY TO THEM IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT THEIR LIVES HAVE VALUE AND THAT WE WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY AND HEALTHY MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS FILL. DON'T HAVE A MOTION -- MOVIE OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION. OF WE WILL DO THE ROLL CALL RIGHT NOW BUT OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE TO BE HOLDING IT OPEN. I SINCE WE ARE MISSING SOME MEMBERS BUT LET'S DO THE ROLL CALL. OKAY AS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD JACKSON MITCHELL MORALE [inaudible] WIENER. WIENER AYE TO THE BILL WILL BE HELD OPEN. THANKS VERY MUCH -- ALL OF THE WITNESSES NOT ONLY DOES VIEW STATE THE TABLE BT EVERYONE ELSE WHO CAME AND SPOKE. AND WILL NOW GO TO YOUR NEXT BILL SENATOR WIENER. WHICH IS UP BY TEN OF FOUR AND IT'S SB TWO THREE THREE THANK YOU FOR SURE. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- AND I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US AND FOR AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. ON THE BILL -- COLLEAGUES ARE SENATE BILL -- TWO THIRTY THREE IS A OF ITS OF I SHOULD VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE KEEPING A SEX WORKERS -- SAFE AND HEALTHY -- IT DOES SO IN TWO WAYS -- FIRST OF ALL SB TWO THIRTY THREE INSURERS THAT SEX WORKERS I FEEL SAFE COMING FORWARD TO REPORT. VIOLENT CRIMES -- WITHOUT THE FEAR THAT THEY THEMSELVES WILL BE ARRESTED FOR SEX WORK OR DRUG POSSESSION -- CRYING OUT RIGHT NOW -- MANY SEX WORKERS DO NOT COME FORWARD TO REPORT VIOLENT CRIMES. OUT OF FEAR THAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE WILL BE ARRESTED WE KNOW THAT OUR SEX WORKERS ARE AT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE RISK OF BEING VICTIMIZED -- IN TERMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES WHETHER IT'S RAPE OR ASSAULT OR KIDNAPPING ROBBERY. AND PARTICULARLY WITH THE RECENT CHANGES IN FEDERAL LAW. MORE A MORE SEX WORKERS -- ARE BEING FORCED TO ENGAGE IN SEX WORK ON THE STREETS EVEN IF THEY WOULD PREFER TO DO SO -- IN A SAFER ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS ONLINE THEY NOW OFTEN HAVE NO CHOICE. BUT TO OUR WORK ON THE STREET -- AND HAVE THAT INCREASED RISK OF VIOLENCE -- AND THE LAST THING WE SHOULD DO IS -- TELL THEM THAT IF YOU COME FORWARD AND REPORT. A ROBBERY ARRAY PUTS OUT READ THAT YOU MAY BE ARRESTED US OF THE BILL WILL PROHIBIT OF THE ARREST OF SEX WORKERS FOR SEX WORKER -- SIX WORK RELATED OFFENSES OR DRUG POSSESSION OFFENSES IF THEY ARE COMING FORWARD TO REPORT -- SPECIFIED SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES. ON IT -- ISN'T SERIOUS ABOUT CRIMES. IN ADDITION -- WE HAVE A AND A RELATED PROBLEM MORE WE WANT. SEC FOR OCCURS TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN SEXUAL HEALTH. A AND TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST HIV AND OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS BECAUSE SEX WORKERS ARE AT INCREASED RISK. OF INFECTIONS. AND CURRENTLY A SEX WORKER -- CAN BE ARRESTED AND AS PART OF THE PROBABLE CAUSE -- THE POLICE CAN SITE THAT THE SET BUT THE PERSON IS CARRYING MULTIPLE CONDOMS -- SO WE'RE SENDING A SIGNAL THAT IF YOU CARRY CONDOMS WITH YOU TO PROTECT YOURSELVES. YOU OF THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU AS PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST YOU -- WERE IN COURT AS EVIDENCE OF SEX WORK -- AND AGAIN WE WANT SEX WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES PROTECT THEIR SEXUAL HEALTH. A AND WE SHOULD NOT BE SENDING A SIGNAL BY CARRIER CONDOM RECURRING A FEW CONDOMS WE'LL GET YOU ARRESTED SO THE BILL -- PROVIDE SIDE -- POSSESSION OF CONDOMS IS NOT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT PROBABLE CAUSE AND COULD NOT BE INTRODUCED IN COURT -- AS EVIDENCE OF SEX WORK -- SO -- THAT IS A BILL -- COLLEAGUES -- IT'S LONG OVERDUE -- I WENT ALSO I RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLYMEMBER LAURA FRIEDMAN WHO -- CARRIED A BILL LAST. GREAT WITNESSES YOU MAY PROCEED. ON A REAL SENATORS. MY NAME IS PEARL CALLAHAN. IDENTIFY AS A SURVIVOR OF SEX TRAFFICKING. AS WELL AS SOMEONE WHO IS ENGAGED IN SURVIVAL SEX. AND HAS WORKED AS A CONSENSUAL SEX WORK. I WASRAISED IN THE INNER CITY OF SACRAMENTO AN AREA CALLED OAK PARK. MY FATHER WAS A SHARECROPPER FROM TEXAS AND HE RELOCATED HERE FOR A BETTER LIFE. MY MOTHER LEFT WHEN I WAS YOUNG. AND HE BY HIMSELF REYES NINE OF US. BY WORKING THREE MINIMUM WAGE JOBS. I SHARED A TWIN BED WITH TWO OF MY SISTERS IN EACH MONTH WHICH STRUGGLE TO HALF OF WE ALWAYS HAD MORE MONTH AT THE END OF THE MONEY. WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD? I DID SOMETHING THAT I SAID I WOULD NEVER DO I GOT PREGNANT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO AND I KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO WAY. THAT MY FATHER COULD EVEN SUPPORT ONE MORE PERSON. SO I HAD TO FIND A WAY TO SUPPORT MY SON. WELFARE WAS NOT AN OPTION. MY FATHER TAUGHT ME. THAT WE HAD TO WORK FOR EVERYTHING WE GOT. SO THAT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY. BECAUSE OF MY AGE IN MY SITUATION HAD VERY LIMITED RESOURCES TO DRAW FROM AND SO. I ENTERED THE SEX TRADE. ONCE IN THE TRADE. I BECAME A TARGET FOR PREDATORS. TO BE EXACT [inaudible] SILENT. WAS A MECHANISM. SO THAT I COULDN'T REACH OUT AND REPORT ANYTHING. DOES IN NO TIME I WAS CAUGHT THEY CALL IT BEING CAUGHT. AND I BECAME A TRACKING THE TRAFFICKING VICTIM. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A GRAPHICALLY. VIOLENT INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO ME. WHEN I WAS TRYING TO ESCAPE MY CAMP? OR TODAY THEY CALL THEM TRAFFICKERS. AND WHY I FEEL SO STRONGLY IN PASSING BILL. SB. TWO THIRTY THREE I JUST GOTTEN AWAY FROM MY PANTS. AND MOVED INTO A WITH A SMALL HOUSE IN A REALLY NICE NEIGHBORHOOD THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT. I MEAN I WAS LIKE SO HAPPY I WAS OVER THE MOON AND I WAS WITH MY FRIEND. THAT ALSO ESCAPED [inaudible] I'M SORRY. LIFE IS REALLY GOOD. MY BROTHER AND HIS GIRLFRIEND CAME OVER TO VISIT AND TO CELEBRATE OUR NEW MOVE AND AS BEING IN THE NEW HOUSE AND EVERYTHING. AND MY TWO FRIENDS PATENT BILL THEY WERE ALSO THERE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HELPED US TO ESCAPE. AND SO WHILE WE WERE THERE BEING HAPPY AND JUST TALKING AND CELEBRATING. THERE WAS POUNDING AT THE DOOR. SO MY FRIEND AND I GOT UP. WENT TO THE LIVING THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT IT WAS AND IT WAS FRANKIE SHE WAS ANOTHER GIRL THAT WAS WITH JOHNNY WE DO HER. SHE WAS SOBBING AT THE DOOR SHE WAS CRYING AND SAYING THAT JOHNNY IT GOING CRAZY THAT HE HAD BEATEN HER AND SHE NEEDED SOME HELP. WE CRACKED THE DOOR OPEN AND AS SOON AS WE CRACKED THAT DOOR. HE KICKED IT AT IT WAS KICKED IN. I REMEMBER SEEING A GUN COMING THROUGH THE DOOR. THAT I WAS BEHIND THE DOOR WHAT'S IT KICK THAT IN ME AND MY FOR AT THEN I SAW AN ARM ATTACHED TO THAT GOING TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS JOHNNY. MY FRIEND AND I RAN OUT THAT DOOR. WE RAN ACROSS THE STREET AND WE CROUCHED BEHIND A CAR. MY BROTHER HIS GIRLFRIEND HAD ALSO RUN OUT LATE WE SOLVE THEM RIGHT NOW. WHEN WE READ WE WERE ACROSS BEHIND THAT CAR WE THAT'S WHEN WE HEARD THE GUNFIRE? IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS FOR EVER I KNOW WAS JUST A FEW SHOTS BUT IT SOUNDED IT JUST SEEMED LIKE IT WENT OFF FOR EVER. IT WAS SO EERILY QUIET. WHEN WE CAME FROM BEHIND THAT CAR WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT? IF WE SHOULD GET OUT OR NOT BECAUSE WHAT IF HE'S THERE WHAT IF YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR US. SO WE STOOD WEEK CROUCH BEHIND THAT CAR FOR QUITE AWHILE AND WE GOTTA. AND WE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE. WE FINALLY WORKED UP THE NERVE TO GO BACK INTO THE HOUSE. WE WALKED SLOWLY. TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE TOWARDS THE BACK DOOR. IT WAS A SIGHT I WILL NEVER FORGET. BLOOD WAS SPRAYED ALL OVER THE LAUNDRY ROOM DOOR. FLOOR AND WALLS. SMEARED ON THE DOOR NEAR THE LATCH WHERE THEY WERE SITES OF STRUGGLE TRYING TO GET OUT THE DOOR BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAFETY LATCH ON IT WAS PAINTED IN DEEP RED. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEBODY HAD BEEN KILLED THERE BUT WE COULDN'T FIND A FRIEND. PATENT BILL WHERE WHERE THE WE SLOWLY MOVED OUT THAT BACK DOOR AND WE COULD HEAR SIRENS. WE NEVER CALL. WE DISTURB THEIR PEACE. THIS BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE BACKYARD AND FOR A MOMENT WE WERE JUST LIKE. INCREDULOUS LIKE WHERE ARE THEY WHERE IS EVERYBODY. WE LOOKED OVER THE NEIGHBOR'S FENCE WAS JUST WILL SMALL THREE FOOT WHITE PICKET FENCE. AND MY FRIEND BILL WAS LAYING ON HIS. BACK AND HE'D BEEN SHOT. PAT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. AND IT SEEMS LIKE WITHIN MOMENTS WE HAD POLICE ALL OVER OUR HOUSE WE HAD PARAMEDICS THAT WITH A HELICOPTER HOVERING ABOVE WITH THE SEARCHLIGHT. AND THE REST REALLY WAS A BLUR. THE POLICE THEY QUESTIONED US. BUT WE COULDN'T TELL THEM IT WAS JOHN. WE KNEW THAT BECAUSE HE KNEW WHERE TO FIND US. IF WE TALKED. HE WOULD KILL US. IT WASN'T LIKE THE POLICE EVEN REALLY TOOK A SERIOUS. WE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GET ARRESTED OURSELVES SO WE WEREN'T WE WERE TOO AFRAID WE WERE GOING TO SAY ANYTHING. OUR SILENCE OUR SILENCE WAS ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL. PARTS OF THAT EXPERIENCE NOT BEING ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING. BUT THAT WAS THE ONE THING THAT KEPT ME AND MY FRIEND ALIVE. AND WE WANTED TO BE FREE. MY PAST EXPERIENCE WITH THE POLICE WAS CLEAR. I WOULD GET ARRESTED. I WOULD GET IN TROUBLE IF I REPORTED ME. AND I JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE I WANTED IT TO BE OVER. PATTON BILL THEY WERE SHOT THAT INCIDENT. BILL WAS SHOT IT WAS THANK GOD IT WAS JUST THE CLEAN THROUGH AND THROUGH. BACK THROUGH THE CHEST AND PAT HE WAS SHOT IN HIS HEAD THROUGH HIS HEAD. BOTH MEN THEY LIVED AND SURVIVE. BUT OUR SILENCE THE SILENCE. TO LIVE THROUGH THAT AND NOT KNOW. AND TO KNOW THAT THERE IS NO HEALTH. ON THE OTHER END NO HELP AT ALL NO HELP.

AS A AS A MEMBER OF SOFT SWAP SACRAMENTO I DO OUTREACH AND SO NOTHING IS CHANGED. I UNDERSTAND THE UNATTENDED UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF OUR SILENCING BUT I JUST WANT THIS BILL PASSED SO THAT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL OUT THERE THAT DON'T HAVE A VOICE. HAVE SOMEBODY TO SPEAK FOR THEM THANK [inaudible] THANK. THANK YOU PRO. SITUACIóN PRITCHETT ALL THE EFFORTS OF SEX OFFENDERS -- TO GET THIS BILL AND MANY LIKE IT PASSED HONORABLE COMMITTEE. IN TWENTY TWELVE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH ISSUED AN GROUNDBREAKING REPORT ON THE USE OF CONDOMS AS EVIDENCE AFTER CONDUCTING INTENSIVE RESEARCH IN SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON DC. THE REPORT INCLUDED A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SURVEY THAT FOUND THAT 60% OF LGBTQ YOUTH SEX WORKERS FEARED CARRYING CONDOMS BECAUSE THEY COULD LEAD TO TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE. IT ALSO INCLUDED A TWENTY TWELVE STUDY THAT FOUND THE JUST OVER HALF THE SEX WORKERS SURVEYED HAD GONE WITHOUT CONDOMS DUE TO FEAR OF ARREST. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY THREE OF THE FOUR CITIES INVOLVED HAVE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF CONDOMS A SEVENTH. THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH REPORT AND MANY LIKE IT PROVIDE AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS OF A POLICY THAT ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF CONDOMS AS EVIDENCE. IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IF CONDOMS CAN GET YOU ARRESTED YOU'RE GAMBLING WITH YOUR FREEDOM EVERY TIME YOU CHOOSE TO USE THEM. THIS VERY CLEARLY DISCOURAGES SEX WORKERS FROM CARRYING CONDOMS GRACING GREATLY INCREASING THE RISK FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND UNWANTED PREGNANCIES AND IS DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH MANY OF OUR STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE OF AIDS FOR INSTANCE PROVIDES CONDOM TO SEX WORKERS AS AN AT RISK FOCUS OF ITS CONDOM DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. THE SPELL OF A CONTRADICTION WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROVIDING CONDOMS TO A POPULATION OF SEX WORKERS AND THEN HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT ARRESTING THOSE SEX WORKERS FOR THE POSSESSION OF WHAT MAY BE THOSE VERY SAME CONDOMS. SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE IN WITHOUT A COMPELLING PUBLIC AND INTEREST IN HAVING SEX WORKERS FEEL FREE TO CARRY CONDOMS ONE WOULD IMAGINE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE SPIRIT OF THIS PROVISION. HAVE AN EQUALLY EARLY SIMILARLY COMPELLING NEED FOR THE USE OF CONDOMS IS EVIDENT. WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD SUCH A NEED ARTICULATED. IN FACT IT APPEARS THAT THE OPPOSITION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT FAILED TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS APPLY. INSTEAD IT FOCUSES ON THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS OF EVIDENCE AND PROBABLE CAUSE ARE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION AND IN THE WORDS OF THE CDA. START A A NOT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THEY KNOW AS WE DO AND AS THIS COMMITTEE DOES THAT LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT IN EVIDENTIARY MATTERS IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE WHEN A STRONG PUBLIC INTEREST IS AT PLAY. AND THEY KNOW AS WE ALL DO THAT MATTERS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARE CONSIDERED A VERY COMPELLING PUBLIC INTEREST. AND FINALLY AS THE CDA RECOGNIZES IN THEIR LETTER OF OPPOSITION THE POLICY ISSUE HERE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAS LED TO THIS BILL BEING ENDORSED BY THE SAN FRANCISCO'S DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE POLICE DEPARTMENT CITY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AGAIN WHAT THIS BILL ASKS FOR THE COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. WE THANK SENATOR WINNER FOR HIS WORK WITH SAINT JAMES INFIRMARY ON THIS BILL AND FOR CONTINUING TO PURSUE SEX WORKER CENTER SOLUTIONS TO MATTERS THAT HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY BEEN ADDRESSED WITHOUT THEIR INPUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

IN SPIRIT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS. SEEING NINE THERE I THINK THAT WAS THEOPPOSITION REGISTERED BUT IS THERE ANYONE ELSE READ -- OPPOSITION. THE FIFTY TO OPEN UP. ONE THE OTHER [inaudible] ONE THEIR FINAL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY BUT MORNING. MEMBERS TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE IT'S RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO COUNTIES HAVING THEIR OWN POLICIES BECAUSE POLICIES CONTENT TO THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL CASES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER AN ITEM. IS EVIDENCE SHOULD BE MADE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE COURTS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS BECAUSE EACH CASE IS UNIQUE. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT ALL EVIDENCE IN A CRIMINAL CASE IS ADMISSIBLE EXCEPT BY TWO THIRDS VOTES OF THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH DEMONSTRATES A CONSTITUTIONAL PREFERENCE FOR ADMISSIBILITY -- ALSO PROVIDES IMMUNITY FOR DRUG CRIMES PROSTITUTION AND COMMITTING A LEWD ACT IN PUBLIC TO ANYONE REPORTING SPECIFIED CRIMES WITHOUT ANY CORROBORATION. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY AND OPPOSITION -- TO SENATE BILL TWO THREE THREE ON WE BELIEVE THAT WHILE THIS BILL PURPORTEDLY ATTEMPTS TO HELP ON CRIME VICTIMS IT CREATES A SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE. TO DRUG OFFENDERS AND DOES ENGAGING IN PROSTITUTION TO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE VICTIMS OF A VIOLENT CRIME TO AVOID ARREST. PERHAPS MORE PROBLEMATIC IN THIS BILL IS THE INAPPROPRIATE CHEFS. ON THAT A GRAYSON NATURE VARIOUS PHASES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THIS BILL PROHIBITS PEACE OFFICERS. FROM ENFORCEABLE ENFORCING THE LAW AND MAKING AN ARREST SPACE ON THE CLAIM OF A CRIMINAL SUSPECT EVEN IN THE FACE OF EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ALREADY ACCOMMODATES PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE SB TWO THIRTY THREE SIX TO PROTECT AS SOME A SENATOR WIENER MENTIONED -- US ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN BILLS FROM LAST YEAR. EVIDENCE OF VICTIMHOOD CAN BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF CHARGING DECISIONS ARGUED IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND OFFERED AS A FACTOR IN MITIGATION. PEACE OFFICERS MUST BE ALLOWED TO ACT BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM. I SHOULD NOT BE PROHIBITED FROM ENFORCING THE LAW SIMPLY BASED ON THE CLAIM OF A PERSON WHO COULD HAVE A STRONG INCENTIVE TO BE LESS THAN. TRUTHFUL. ADDITIONALLY PROHIBITING THE POSSESSION OF A CONDO FROM PROVIDING A BASIS FOR PROBABLE CAUSE DETERMINATIONS OR BEING ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE TAKES INFORMATION AWAY FROM PEACE OFFICERS. PROSECUTORS JUDGES AND JURIES WHEN ALL THOSE ENTITIES HAVE RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITIES TO ASSASSIN ADDRESS SITUATIONS WITH A TO TALLY OF CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AND IN MIND. ON FOR THOSE REASONS WE SPEC FULLY ASK FOR YOU KNOW VOTE THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT -- COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] I'M. CENTER WINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- A WITH RESPECT TO THE OPPOSITION I WHAT YOU KNOW I I I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW THESE THINGS ACTUALLY PLAY OUT. OF WHAT WILL WE SEE FOR MANY YEARS IS SEX WORKERS DON'T WANT TO COME FORWARD -- AND AND REPORT CRIMES -- AND WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THAT WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THEM. TO A CARRY CONDOMS AND PROTECT THEMSELVES. AND THE BILL SIGNING STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE IN PARTICULAR WITH CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS -- THAT WE WORKED ON WHAT THE COMMITTEE -- VERY CLEAR THIS IS AND NARROWLY FOCUSED -- BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. WE HAVE A MOTION. RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION -- WE DEFINITELY WANT SEX WORKERS TO FEEL-- YOU'LL NOT ONLY CONFIDENT BUT WE ONE HALF CRIMES AGAINST SEX WORKERS REPORTED. AND I THINK THAT THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE DA'S I'M SURE YOU'LL BE AND WORK DISCUSSION TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY. TO ADDRESS OR NOT BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS. IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION AND APPRECIATE YOUR WITNESSES TESTIMONY NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. SO DO A ROLL CALL. MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE FLOOR SKINNER. HI SKINNER HI MORE LOCK. WELL LOOK NO BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL MORALE. NO AROUND NOW WIENER AYE WIENER AYE. RIGHT SO WE WILL KEEP THE BILL ON HOLD BECAUSE WE ARE MISSING MEMBERS AND APPRECIATE AND NOW WE WILL. HEAR FROM -- SENATOR SKINNER ON ITEM ONE SB FORD THANK YOU I MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBER. WHO -- SB. FORTY TWO IS A CONTINUATION OF A BILL THAT I INTRODUCED AT THE END OF SESSION LAST YEAR. WHICH I KNEW WE WERE GOING TO MOVE ON JUST BECAUSE IT WAS THE END OF SESSION BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE BRINGING IT BACK BEFORE US TODAY. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE -- IN OUR COUNTY IF IS FACILITIES OBVIOUSLY MA'AM MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE BEING HELD NOW IN OUR COUNTY FACILITIES DUE TO REALIGNMENT -- AND ARE COUNTY FACILITIES RELEASE PEOPLE ARE BSED ON THE TIME OF THE DAY PROCESS THAT RELEASE. SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT WE HAVE HAD [inaudible] TRAGICALLY PREVENTABLE DEATHS -- IN MY OWN DISTRICT A YOUNG WOMAN JESSICA ST LOUIS WAS RELEASED FROM SANTA RITA JAIL AT ONE TWENTY FIVE IN THE MORNING. SHE WAS GIVEN A PART TICKET. PART IS THE TRANSIT -- THE LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT IN THE AREA IS NOT FAR FROM SAN REDUCE JAIL I HAVE MYSELF WALKED IT FROM SATA RITA TO PART. FOR PARTIES NOT OPEN IN BEGIN OPERATING TWO HOURS AFTER THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS RELEASED. THE AREA BETWEEN THE SANTA RITA JAIL AND SUPPORT STATION IS BY AND LARGE ISOLATED. AND THERE'S NOTHING AROUND INTO YOU GET RIGHT TO THE BART STATION WHERE THERE IS THEN SOME RESIDENCES BUT BETWEEN. SANTA RITA JAIL AND THAT NOTHING. AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE ARE PREDATORY PEOPLE THAT. HANG OUT NEAR JAILS HUMAN TRAFFICKERS IN OTHERS BECAUSE THEY'RE HOPING THAT WHEN A PERSON'S RELEASED THEIR VULNERABLE THAT THEY MIGHT. MAYBE THEY CAN -- ENGAGING IN THEIR TRADER WHO KNOWS WHAT. BUT IN THIS INSTANCE. YES GOOD SAINT LOUIS WAS FOUNDED. RIGHT NEAR THE BART STATION. AND WHAT EIGHT BEING RELEASED WITH ONLY A BART TICKET. RIGHT NOW UNDER THE LAW YOU DON'T LET'S SAY YOU ARE -- WHEN YOU ARE -- PUT INTO THE FACILITY LET'S SAY YOU'RE IN POSSESSION OF A CELL PHONE SOME OTHER THINGS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT. TO HAVE THAT CELL PHONE -- CHARGED SO WHEN YOU'RE THEN RELEASED THE THAT CELLPHONE MAY BE DEAD. AND YOU MAY HAVE NO ABILITY TO CHARGE IT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT. TO ALLOW YOU TO MAKE A PHONE CALL TO ARRANGE -- FOR SOME -- TRANSPORT HOME THERE'S YOU HAVE NO MONEY -- IN MOST CASES AND SO BASICALLY WERE CREATING AN EXTREME VULNERABILITY SO THE PURPOSE OF MY BILL IS TO END LATE NIGHT RELEASES AND TO ENSURE THE COUNTY JAILS OFFER BASIC SERVICES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET HOME SAFE. FREE PHONE CALLS ACCESS TO CELL PHONE CHARGERS TRANSPORTATION COUNTY SUPPORT SERVICES WERE SAFE PLACE TO WAIT UNTIL IT IS NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS -- SO I WOULD LIKE MY WITNESSES -- TO TO NOW -- SPEAK WE HAVE -- CREATE GOMEZ FROM THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FREEDOM CENTER YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER IS THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. AND THOMAS TURNER WHO IS THE FATHER OF JESSICA ST LOUIS THE YOUNG WOMAN I DESCRIBED. IT'S JUST A CANNELLA NORTH YEOMAN'S FREEDOM CENTER. ON THE SECOND WE SWITCH STAFF ON SO I'M JUST GOING ON AND THE DECORATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FREEDOM CENTER. AND I AM HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE GETTING HOME -- SAFETY ACT SENATE BILL. SB. FORTY TWO AND IT I JUST WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHO THIS IS THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY IMPACT ARM I AM ALSO PART OF THE STORAGE FRIEDMAN COALITION I'M A FORMALLY INCARCERATED PERSON. AND A GROUP OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED ON WOMEN AND GIRLS FROM THE STATE -- WHO ARE FIRMLY INCARCERATED -- IN SPECIFICALLY AS AS A WOMAN -- BEING RELEASED IN IN THE MIDDLEOF THE NIGHT WITH NO SUPPORT WITH NO ACCESS TO A PHONE -- WHEN WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT THE TRAGIC DEATH OF JESSICA ST LOUIS AND WERE ON BUILDING IN COMMUNITY WE ACTUALLY GOT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CALLS AND MESSAGES FROM WOMEN ACROSS THE STATE? WHO HAD BEEN PHYSICALLY AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED UPON RELEASE COULD BEEN RELEASD -- IN JUST. PAPER AT SUITS -- WHO DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO CALLS ON AND? ALSO FOR AMEND THIS DOESN'T JUST IMPACT WOMAN ON ALSO YOU SEEN -- MOTHERS -- ELDERLY MOTHERS WHO ARE GOING TO PICK UP THEIR SONS DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME THEY'RE GETTING OUT HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE BACKSEAT. FOR HOURS BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO WHILE THEY'RE WAITING FOR THAT FOR THEIR CHILD TO BE RELEASED IN THE CHILDREN OF SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY. AND SO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS ARE LIKE CENTER CENTERS SKINNER SAID ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION ACCESS TO ADEQUATE -- SUPPORT CONNECTION TO SUPPORT SERVICES -- PHONE CALLS YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE YOUR CELL PHONE CHARGE I KNOW I KNOW. ABSOLUTELY NOBODY'S PHONE NUMBER BY HEART -- EXCEPT FOR MY OFFICE BECAUSE I WASN'T CHANGES IN TWENTY SIX YEARS. ON AND SO AND AND THESE THIS SIMPLE I'M SOLUTION ACROSS THE STATE COULD SAVE. SOME LIVES AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES FROM. SAFER SO WE'RE IN -- IN SUPPORT OF OF THIS BILL IN IT AND THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO SAY IS -- YOU KNOW WE HAD STORIES OF WOMEN WHO WERE TRAILED BY TAXI DRIVERS AND DRIVERS WHO WERE WAITING OUTSIDE OF SANTA RITA JAIL AND OTHER JAILS ACROSS THE STATE THING I WILL GIVE YOU A RIDE FOR SEXUAL FAVORS. AND SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE COMMUNITY SAFETY AND AS A FORMALLY INCARCERATED WOMEN I KNOW THAT -- THOSE CRITICAL CONNECTIONS IMMEDIATELY UPON RELEASE ARE SUPER IMPORTANT FOR MY OWN REENTRY AND TO HELP CREATE SAFER COMMUNITIES MISTER TURNER. GOOD MORNING GOD COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHAIR PERSON -- I COME THE DATES IN SUPPORT OF SB. FORTY TWO IF I MAY BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH YOU PHí PERSPECTIVE. I COME ALSO.

O THAT EACH ABOUT CHILDREN CAN REACH US. BUT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN. SHE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE A PHONE CALL. SHE WAS GIVEN [inaudible] A TICKET. THAT WAS REALLY USELESS. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WAS A RUNNING. SHE WAS AXED TO EXIT THE FACILITY. AND TO A VERY UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT. I FEEL THAT TODAY THE SAME WAY THAT THE CORONR CALLED ME. TO TELL ME THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS THERE. I FEEL LIKE THE SAME PHONE CALL COULD BEING GIVEN TO HER. TO TELL ME THAT SHE WAS A LIFE. AS SHE WAS RELEASED. I ONLY LIVE TWENTY MINUTES FROM SELL RETAIL.

ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NORMAN NELSON RESIDENT OF YOU'LL COUNTY IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM AT THE TABLE. PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JESSICA. GOOD MORNING -- I'M CHAIR AND SENATORS LUCIA MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB -- FORTY TWO FIRST I'LL LET ME SAY MY DEEPEST SYMPATHY. FOR THIS GENTLEMAN AND HIS LOSS I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THAT MUST BE LIKE -- BUT WE MUST IMPOSE BASED ON THE COSTLY AND BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS ON COUNTY JAILS RELATIVE TO IN MAKE REALLY SAYS. SOME OF WHICH WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AND EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE WITH WHICH TO COMPLY. WELL COUNTY JAILS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE OF INMATES WHILE IN PHYSICAL CUSTODY THE REACH AND RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC ENTITIES CAN ONLY EXTEND SO FAR -- SHERIFF'S ALREADY YOU OFFER A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM TO IN MAKES. A THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO STAY IN CUSTODY. STUDIO FACILITY FOR UP TO SIXTEEN ADDITIONAL HOURS OR UNTIL NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS WHICHEVER IS SHORTER. IN ORDER TO OFFER INMATES THE ABILITY TO BE DISCHARGED TO A TREATMENT CENTER -- DURING DAYTIME HOURS. HOWEVER SB FORTY TWO WILL REQUIRE THE SHERIFF TO ALLOW THE PERSON TO STAY IN JAIL OR OFFER A SAFE PLACE TO STAY IF THE INMATE DECLINES RELEASE DURING EVENING AND EARLY MORNING HOURS. SUCH A MANDATE CREATES SPACE AND COST CHALLENGES WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS A SAFE SPACE IN JAIL WOULD BE WE WOULD HAVE TO KEEP AWAY FROM OTHER INMATES. FURTHER IF THE PERSON DOES NOT FEEL SAFE ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE FACILITY BUT DECLINES THE OPTION TO STAY. SB. FORTY TWO REQUIRES THE SHERIFF TO PROVIDE FREE TRANSPORTATION TO LOCATION OF THE PERSON'S CHOOSING WITHIN THE COUNTY OR WITHIN A HUNDRED MILE RADIUS WHICHEVER IS FURTHER. FOR GEOGRAPHICALLY LARGE COUNTIES SMALL OVERALL COUNTIES WITH STAFFING LIMITATIONS AND COUNTIES THAT RELEASE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INMATES ON A DAILY BASIS. THIS UNFUNDED MANDATE WOULD CRIPPLED THE PROVISION OF OTHER SERVICES AND TURN PEACE OFFICERS AND SHERIFFS STAFFING TO DRIVERS WHO SPEND THEIR DAYS TRAVERSING THE COUNTY AT THE WHIM OF RECENTLY RELEASED INMATES. SEVERAL OF THE BILL'S MANDATES ALSO CREATE MASSIVE LIABILITY FOR COUNT COUNTY GOVERNMENTS. BY REQUIRING TRANSPORTATION TO ON THE LOCATION OF THE INMATES CHOOSING PUBLIC STAFF COULD BE FORCED TO UNWITTINGLY. DR AN AT RISK IN MAY TO THE DRUG DEALERS LOCATION FOR EXAMPLE. PROVIDING A RELEASED IN MADE THREE DAY SUPPLY OF ANY NECESSARY MEDICATION CREATES RISK TO THE RELEASED PERSON AND OTHERS. SINCE THERE IS NO LIMITATION ON THE TYPE OF MEDICATION THAT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE PERSON. AND NO ABILITY TO SUPERVISE APPROPRIATE. LEADERS RELEASE INMATES. SB FORTY TWO IS ALSO INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT WHILE THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS BE MOLDED NOTION THAT LATE NIGHT RELEASES SUBJECT WOMEN. TO PREDATORS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH COUNTY JAIL NOT JAIL NIGHT RELEASE PRACTICES I WAS JUST MENTIONED. THE BILL REQUIRES THIS SHERIFF TO MAKE THE RELEASE SANDERS RELEASE PROCESSES AND RELEASE SCHEDULES OF A COUNTY JAIL AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND POST THEM ONLINE. WELL WE UNDERSTAND A DESIRE TO KEEP PERSONS RECENTLY. RELEASED FROM CUSTODY STE. SAFE THIS BILL IMPOSES A SERIES OF EXPENSIVE UNWORKABLE MANDATES AND FOR THESE REASONS WE I REQUEST YOU NOBLE AND THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE'LL START WITH SENATOR MITCHELL AND SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR -- WHEN IT'S THE PERFECT TIME I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL? QUESTION OF THE OPPOSITION I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR COMMENT ABOUT AN EXPECTATION THAT -- SHERIFF'S WOULD BECOME DRIVERS WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT CURRENTLY TO TRANSPORT INMATES TO A COURT FOR COURT PROCEEDINGS. THAT'S CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL UNIT -- THAT THAT ENGAGES IN THAT IN THAT TRANSPORT. YES CENTER SOME OUTSIDE SOME SHARE DEPARTMENTS TO YES. BUT NOT ALL NOT ALL THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL UNIT HAD A TRANSPORT INMATES TO COURT WELL THEY STILL HAVE SHERIFF DEPUTIES TO TAKE CARE BYE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A SPECIAL AND LARGER COUNTIES HAVE GOT IT SHOWS. OKAY THAT. SOLD THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT SHERIFF'S TRANSPORT IN MY CORRECT OKAY -- SECONDLY -- I HEARD ALL THE OPPOSITION AND WHILE MOST OF IT DEALT WITH WITH -- FISCAL CONCERNS I APPRECIATE THIS IS NOT A FISCAL COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER IF EITHER IN CONCERT WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. IF THERE'S ANYTHING THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION HAS COME UP WITH ARE GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO ABOUT A MORE APPROPRIATE WAY IN WHICH TO RELEASE IT MIGHT -- OR WE ARE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO DISCUSS -- THAT WITH THAT AUTHORS OFFICE AND CONTINUE TO CONVERSATIONS WITHIN OUR ASSOCIATION BUT ABSENT THE BILL GIVEN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AND JUST THE ISSUES WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE. YOU ALL HAVE NOT PRO ACTIVELY COME UP WITH IDEAS ARE POLICIES OF SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW YOU CAN KEEP. FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. SAFE UPON THEIR RELEASE WELL EACH COUNTY HAS THEIR OWN PRACTICES SO AS AN ASSOCIATION. ON IN ANY CONSIDERATION GIVEN I APPRECIATE THE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED ANY AS I LISTEN TO YOU I THOUGHT LOW GFR SHARE FROM OUR TRY TO AVOID THOSE COSTS AND GIVEN. THE LEVEL THE THE THE THAT LEVERAGES THE WHAT'S THE WORD I WHAT THE POWER THE AUTHORITY A SHERIFF MAY HAVE -- WOULD YOU HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AROUND COSTS IF THE SHERIFF USED HIS OR HER DISCRETION AND RELEASE THE ONE TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HOURS EARLY. THERE REALLY STATE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THE EXTRA COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CARRYING THEM OVER YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE OR TO THE NEXT DAY. AND THAT BEEN CONSIDERED AT ALL NOW THAT AGAIN THAT WOULD BE UP TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SHERIFF AND RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE THEIR THEY HAVE DISCRETION. AND THE VOLUNTARILY CAN DO DO THAT SO WE DON'T SEE WHY YOU WOULD NEED TO BE AND MANDATE. AND AGAIN I MANDATE IS NOT JUST THIS BILL MANDATING IS ALL THE OTHER LEGISLATION THAT MANDATES. THAT THEY ALL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED TOGETHER AS FAR AS BUDGET IS CONCERNED I'M CLEAR AND I THINK THAT THIS THE STATE. OFTEN YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE TO MANDATE BUT IN INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE COUNTIES WHO HAVE FALLEN SHORT. WHERE PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN VICTIMIZED I'M ASSUMING THOSE A COUNTIES WHO DON'T HAVE THE VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WHERE THE THIS THE SHERIFF CHOOSES TO USE HIS OR HER DISCRETION? IN TERMS OF TIME WE NEVER LEAVE THAT'S WHAT FORCES US AS THE STATE INTO THE MANDATE BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF CONSISTENCY AND CLEARLY -- LACK OF SAFETY I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSES -- AND AGAIN AT THE PERFECT TIME OF LIKE -- TO MOVE THE BILL PLEASE THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR BRADFORD. I THINK YOU AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE SENATOR OUT SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR IT THANKS TO COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT'S LONG OVERDUE. AND I'M FRANKLY INSULTED AT THE RESPONSE THAT THE CALIFORNIA DA HOUSE IN REGARDS. TO THE FISCAL COST BUT WHAT IS THE FISCAL COST OF A LIFE. AND I SIT HERE TODAY REPRESENTING A FAMILY WHO LOST THEIR DAUGHTER PATRICIA RICHARDSON THAT YOU SHOULD BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH. SHE WAS A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO WAS RELEASED AFTER ONE AM. FROM THE SHERIFF'S CUSTODY IN MALIBU ALONG TO MASCO CANYON. ONE THE MOST DARK. DESOLATE WORLD YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE IN LA COUNTY. AFTER ONE AM. FORD FAMILY NOT TO FIND HER FOR YOU DEAR AFTER THE FACT. IN BITS AND PIECES BECAUSE SHE'D BEEN RAVAGED BY ANIMALS COYOTES. AND HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY LETTING ANYONE GO AFTER ONE AM REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE WHETHER TO AND URBAN AREA OR RURAL AREA. AND TO SIT HERE AND SAY IT'S ABOUT FISCAL COST IT COSTS YOU NOTHING TAKE CAPTOR THERE FOR ANOTHER EIGHT HOURS AND TELLS THE DAYLIGHT. IT COSTS YOU NOTHING TOLD OUR AFFORD HER PHONE CALL TO HER FAMILY JUST LIKE MISTER TURNER WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE. AT AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO PICK HER UP A YOUNG LADY WHO WAS RE ARRESTED ONLY FOR ODD BEHAVIOR AT A RESTAURANT SHE HAD COMMITTED NO CRIME. AND SHE LOST HER LIFE SO TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT FISCAL. CONSTRAINT ON THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. I SAY SHAME ON THE SHARES ANYONE ELSE. WE HAVE A MOTION. I WOULD LIKE TO TO THE SECOND AT LEAST A PORTION OF THAT I DON'T KNOW MY COUNTY STILL DOESN'T. BUT THEY OF ONE OF MY COUNTIES WOULD LET PEOPLE OUT TWELVE THIRTY ONE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT THEIR JAIL IS IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE. AND I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULD DO THEIR WHAT DO THEY THINK THOSE PEOPLE GOING TO HITCH A RIDE OR THERE'S A BUS OR I MEAN. THIS IS THE KIND OF ATTITUDE I THINK THAT MAKES PEOPLE REALLY QUESTION THE GOOD FAITH OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT SOMETIME SO I THINK IT REALLY BEHOOVES. LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEMONSTRATE. THAT IT ALSO HAS A LEVEL OF COMPASSION AND HUMANITY THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS TO SERVE. AND WHEN THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENS I'M HOPING THAT WE HAVE STOPPED THAT PRACTICE IN. IN ONE OF MY COUNTIES. EACH TEACHER FROM THE EXIST AND IT REALLY DOES IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT PEOPLE END UP HIT BY CARS FOR EXAMPLE MY COMMUNITY ON THE ONE ã ONE FREEWAY THAT'S THE ONLY AVENUE THEY HAVE TO EVEN TRY TO CATCH A RIDE SOMEWHERE. WHERE TO BE WALKING ALONG THE FREEWAY BECAUSE IT'S LET? ME IN. THESE ARE JUST THESE ARE JUST. COMPASSIONATE THINGS THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY TO DO THEM BUT IT'S AN ATTITUDE IN AND AND AND OUTLOOK THAT I THINK. NEEDS TO BE. RIVER RE EVALUATED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AS YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE WORKING WITH US AND NOT -- DEFYING THOSE LEVELS OF HUMANITY THAT I THINK WE ALL ARE ENTITLED TO EXPECT. CENTERS CAN OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER BRAZIER. I THINK WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IS THAT. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. IS TO PREVENT AVOIDABLE DEATHS. WE DO NOT NEED. MISTER TURNER SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO COME HERE. ON IN THE FAMILY OF THE YOUNG WOMAN THAT SENATOR BRADFORD REFERENCED SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH WHAT THEY DEALT WITH. CERTAINLY THE SPONSORS AN IRA AWARE THAT. WE WILL HAVE TO BE DOING SOME NEGOTIATIONS ON THE CONTENT OF THE BILL DO COSTS. AND SO THEIR POT PARTS THAT MAY. BE MODIFIED. BUT AT MINIMUM. BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO FREE CALLS AT MINIMUM BEING ABLE TO KNOW THAT YOUR CELL PONE IS CHARGED. AT MINIMUM VARIOUS THINGS THAT ARE IN HERE. I MAKING SURE THAT ALL COUNTIES WOULD OFFER THE ABILITY TO STAY TILL. I'M DAYLIGHT HOURS WHILE OUR SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION REP MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW MANY COUNTIES DO. IT IS NOT REQUIRED SO THAT IS ELECTIVE AND I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES THAT DON'T. SO -- WE OBVIOUSLY WILL BE HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE BILL TO APPROACH -- BUT I DO NOT WANT A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE ANYONE LIKE MISTER TURNER HAS TO BE. COME TO SACRAMENTO AND TESTIFY UNTIL SUCH AS THIS. SO WE WANT TO FIX OUR PRACTICE IN WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR MITCHELL'S MADAM SECRETARY RIDGE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. QUESTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. SKINNER AYE MOORLACH AYE MOORLACH AYE BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORALE [inaudible] WIENER. PASSES FIVE ZERO AND WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN. THAT TAKES US TO OUR FINAL BILL. SENATOR SKINNER WE HAVE SB THREE NINETY FOUR THANK YOU I'VE MISSED RIDE SHARING MEMBERS. SO SB THREE NINETY FOUR WILL ALLOW. WITH THIS AGREEMENT SO REQUIRES THE AGREEMENT BY THE JUDGE THE DA AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. IT WOULD ALLOW. FOR A DIVERSION. PROGRAM FOR A PRIMARY CARE GIVER WHO IS CHARGED WITH THE KIDS A CRIME -- AND AGAIN AS I INDICATED THIS WOULD REQUIRE AGREEMENT BY THE JUDGE THE DA AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. NOW THE POINT WHY SAID THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER WHILE WE ARE. CONCERNED OF COURSE ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE. OF A PARENT OR A CUSTODIAL INDIVIDUAL OF CHILDREN THIS COULD BE SOMEONE WHO IS THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER TO AN ELDERLY RELATIVE OR TO A DISABLED PERSON. AND THE POINT BEING IS THAT. WE CREATE GREAT COSTS TO THE STATE. WHEN WE HOLD PEOPLE WHO ARE OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO THEN HAVE NO ONE TO CARE FOR THEM? BUT EDITION WAVE WE TAKE CHILDREN THERE ARE VERY SEVERE CONSEQUENCES TO CHILDREN TO HAVE INCARCERATED PARENTS. ONLY 15% OF CHILDREN WITH INCARCERATED FATHER EVER EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE. ONLY 2% OF CHILDREN WITH INCARCERATED MOTHER EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE THAT'S COMPARED ALSO CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED PARENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO THEMSELVES BECOME INCARCERATED SO WE WANT TO BREAK THAT CYCLE IF IT IS POSSIBLE CLEARLY. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE A DANGER. TO OUR THE SOCIETY NEED TO BE INCARCERATED AND WE WERE IN WE WOULD NOT SEE SUCH AN AGREEMENT BY A JUDGE JUDY A AND P. D.. THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED BY THIS BILL IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT CERTAINLY IF WE CAN ALLOW FOR DIVERSION IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. SO WITH THAT I WILL ALLOW MY WITNESSES TO SPEAK. I HAVE -- ASHLEY CARTER. ASHLEY FOR QUALITY AND ASHLEY CARTER WHO IS FORMALLY INCARCERATED FOR DAUGHTER ASIA. WHO -- AS I MENTIONED IS THE DAUGHTER OF ASHLEY AND THEN -- THOSE ARE MY WITNESSES. HI MY NAME IS ASIA AND MY FAMILY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT MY FAMILY AND I AM PROUD TO BE A CARD TO THOMAS AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHO WOULD SAY THE SAME THING BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY WHO IS WHO YOU COULD TURN TO IN A CRISIS? WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD AND MY MOTHER WENT TO PRISON HAVING YOUR MOTHER TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SOMATIC REGARDLESS BUT IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU'RE ONLY? THREE GROWING UP I WOULD TRY TO RELATE TO OTHER KIDS BUT WHEN KIDS WE'LL FIND OUT MY PARENTS RAMPAGE AND I WILL GET BELIEVE AT EVERY SCHOOL I WENT. TO I AM VERY TRUSTING IN GENTLE IN PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. SO I WOULD SHARE MY STORY WITH MY SO CALLED FRIENDS AND THEY WOULD SAY THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEN THEY WOULD TURN AROUND IN THE MIDDLE CLASS AND SAY THAT'S WHY YOUR DAD IN PRISON. BECAUSE THEY KNEW WOULD HURT ME I WAS ONLY IN SECOND GRADE AT THE TIME. I WOULD GET SO EXCITED WHEN MY NANA WOULD TAKE ME TO GO SEE MY MOTHER WHEN I GOT THERE TO VISIT HER I WOULD RUN INTO HER ARMS AND SHE WOULD CALL ME SO TIGHT I COULDN'T. I ALMOST COULDN'T BE. THEN WE WOULD SIT DOWN AND TALK IN PLACE FLAPJACK CRAZY A SINGLE FISH. WE WOULD TAKE OUR PICTURES AND TALK SOME MORE BEFORE IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE. NO MATTER HOW LONG THE VISITS LASTED IT WAS NEVER ENOUGH TIME. THERE ISN'T EVER ENOUGH TIME IN THE WORLD WITH YOUR MOTHER I SUPPOSE SHE NOT ONLY A FEW HOURS EVERY THREE MONTHS IF THAT. AFTER VISITING THERE'S A FEELING THAT COMES OVER YOU WHEN YOU'RE WALKING THROUGH OUT THE GATE. LEAVING THE PRISON WALKING TO THE CAR AND WHEN YOU REALIZE IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO AND YOUR PARENT IS COMING WITH YOU IT'S LIKE POURING SALT IN AN OPEN WOUND. WHEN MY MOM WAS GONE EVERYDAY THINGS THAT I WOULD NORMALLY DO WITH HER? INSTEAD I HAD TO DO IT BY MYSELF OR WITH MY NANA IN THAT WOULD HURT. BECAUSE CHILDREN NEED THEIR MOTHER AND IT'S BEEN THIS WAY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN CHANGE THAT. I BELIEVE THAT IF MY MOM HAD AN OF WENT TO PRISON A LOT OF THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT. MAYBE SHE WAS THERE TO TELL ME I WAS PRETTY EVERY DAY LIKE I SEE HER DOING WITH MY LITTLE SISTER NOW. I WOULD HAVE BETTER SELF ESTEEM I WOULD THINK THAT I'M GOOD ENOUGH I WOULD THINK THAT I'M GOOD ENOUGH IN THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE MYSELF NO MATTER WHO'S AROUND INSTEAD OF HAVING TO HIDE MY TOOTH. IN MY TRUE FEELINGS IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED. OUR RELATIONSHIP AND OUR BOND WOULD BE STRONGER YOU WOULD KNOW SO MUCH MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER AND WE WILL GET ALONG MORE. I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE NIGHTMARES OF GOING TO PRISON MYSELF. MY MOM DIDN'T KNOW ME WHEN SHE CAME HOME AND I DIDN'T KNOW HER AND WE'RE STILL LEARNING THINGS ABOUT EACH OTHER EVERY DAY. WE BOTH KIND OF ROMANTICIZED A REUNIFICATION THAT'LL BE EASIER AND CLEANER BUT THAT'S THE THING ABOUT REUNIFICATION IT'S MESSY SENATE AND HARD BUT IT'S WORTH IT. NO MATTER WHAT WE NEED ARE MOM. YOUR MOM TO BE THERE WHEN YOU FALL OFF YOUR BIKE WHICH GRAY PUNY OR IF YOU'RE GETTING BULLIED AT SCHOOL. YOUR MOM IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE BUT IF YOU TAKE THAT AWAY YOU OF NOTHING THE PERSON BEING CONVICTED AND GOING TO PRISON ISRAEL ISN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS TO SUFFER. FROM DEALING WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND IF THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE THEM THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR FRIENDS AND ESPECIALLY THEIR CHILDREN I HOPE THAT THIS BILL PASSES SELECT CHANGE SO MANY LIVES AND KEEP OTHER KIDS FROM EXPERIENCING THE SAME KIND OF PAIN THANK YOU [inaudible] RICHARD. HELLO MY NAME IS ASHLEY CARTER -- I'M FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMAN. VERY NEAR AND DEAR. YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AS I CAN GET THROUGH A TEST. I DON'T THINK THAT I AM UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT WHEN MY DAUGHTER ASIA WAS BORN. I HELD HER IN MY ARMS LOOKED HER IN HER EYES. AND FOR HER THAT I WOULD PROTECT HER WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING. I PROMISED HER THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO BE OF IT UP. BECAUSE MAMA WOULD TAKE CARE OF HER AND NEVER LEAVE HER SIDE. AND I LIED. WHEN ANGEL WAS EIGHT MONTHS OLD HER FATHER AND I WERE INDICTED ON DRUG CHARGES? I WAS FACING TEN YEARS I HAD NO PRIOR CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND I HAD NEVER BEEN MORE SCARED IN MY LIFE. THE THOUGHT OF ME HAVING TO LEAVE MY DAUGHTER TERRIFIED ME. WHAT PARENT EVER DREAMS OF NEVER BEING ABLE TO HOLD THEIR CHILD AGAIN? MAKE THEM PANCAKES IN THE MORNING. I TEACH THEM HOW TO TIE THEIR SHOES -- OR EVEN SCOLD THEM FOR NOT CLEANING THE ROOM LIKE YOU'VE ASKED THEM TO DO A HUNDRED TIMES THAT DAY. THOSE WERE THE SCENARIOS THAT WOULD PLAY OUT OF MY HEAD ON A DAILY BASIS. I WOULD WATCH HER GROW TRYING MY HARDESTTO TAKE AS MANY MENTAL SNAPSHOTS AS I POSSIBLY COULD KNOWING THAT ONE DAY. ALL I WOULD HAVE OF MY DAUGHTER WOULD BE THOSE MEMORIES. I SPENT THE SUBSEQUENT THREE YEARS FIGHTING FOR NOT ONLY MY LIFE BEFORE MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE AS WELL. I WAS DETERMINED TO SHOW THE COURTS THAT I KNEW I HAD MESSED UP AND I WAS NOT ONLY WILLING. BUT I WAS ABLE AND DETERMINED TO DO THE RIGHT THING. TO SOMEHOW PROVE THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD MADE THESE BAD CHOICES I WAS NOT A BAD PERSON. MY LIFE UP UNTIL I BECAME A MOTHER HAD BEEN FILLED WITH CHAOS. POVERTY UNCERTAINTY POOR CHOICES AND ABUSE PERMEATED MY DAILY EXISTENCE. I HAD NO CLUE WHO I WAS OUTSIDE OF THOSE DYNAMICS. I WAS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF. BUT FROM ANY SENSE OF FAMILY PURPOSE AND COMMUNITY. THERE WAS A MUCH IN LIFE THAT I CARED ABOUT BECAUSE MY LIFE EXPERIENCE UP UNTIL THAT POINT HAD TAUGHT ME THAT NOT MUCH IN LIFE CARED ABOUT ME. BUT THAT'S NOT WHO I WAS ANYMORE. I WORK TWO JOBS TO PROVIDE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND MY MOTHER WAS DISABLED AND LIVING WITH US AT THE TIME. I QUICKLY BECAME A RECOGNIZED EMPLOYEE AND BEGAN MOVING UP THE RANKS WITHIN THE COMPANY FROM MY WORKED. I THOUGHT THEIR OPINION ATTENDED REGULARLY I ENROLLED IN COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL. AN INDUSTRY THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT BUT NEVER HAD ENOUGH FAITH IN MYSELF TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH. NOT NOT ONLY DID I EXCEL PROFESSIONALLY AND ACADEMICALLY BUT ALSO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ELECTRONIC MONITORING DRUG TESTING AND COMPLIED WITH EVERY OTHER PRE TRIAL STIPULATION WITH NOT ONE SINGLE VIOLATION IN THREE YEARS. I COMPILED LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT I WORKED WITH PETITIONING THE COURTS TO ALLOW ME TO REMAIN AT HOME TO CARE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND MOTHER. POLICE OFFICERS EVEN SHOWED UP TO MY HEARINGS IN SUPPORT. IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE. ALTHOUGH I HAD COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE COURTS IT WAS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. I WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T LET ME GET AWAY. I HAD TO PAY FOR WHAT I HAD DONE. THE REALITY OF THE MATTER IS I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT ENDED UP PAYING WITH THAT SENTENCE. UPON GOING TO PRISON MY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER BECAME EASY TARGETS FOR HOME INVASION. MY MOTHER WAS TIED UP AND BEATEN FRONT OF MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS BEING RESTRAINED WITH THE GUN TO HER HEAD. THIS BECAME WORD THIS BECAUSE WORD ON THE STREETS WAS THAT I HAD WENT TO PRISON FOR SELLING DRUGS. SO THERE HAVE TO BE STASHES OF MONEY IN THE HOUSE. AFTER THE HOME INVASION MY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WERE NO LONGER ABLE TO STAY IN THAT HOME. MY MOTHER WHO WAS NOW DEALING WITH THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ISSUES STEMMING FROM THE ATTACK WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A LOCAL SHELTER WITH MY DAUGHTER. HERE AT THE SHELTER MY DAUGHTER WAS AGAIN VICTIMIZED BY ANOTHER RESIDENT OF THE FACILITY. HERE I WAS THE MOTHER WHO LOOKED INTO HER BABY SITES. AND SWORE TO PROTECT HER. WITH NO NO WHERE TO BE FOUND DURING MOST VULNERABLE MOMENT. I HAD LET THE MONSTERS GET. AB. AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO ABOUT IT. I WAS POWERLESS. I SHARE THESE STORIES WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE BOTH OF THE WICKS THAT I CARRY WITH ME EVERY DAY. THE PAIN AND THE GUILT OF HOW DIFFERENT HER LIFE COULD HAVE BEEN. IF I COULD HAVE JUST BEEN THERE FOR HER. THE DESTRUCTION AND HURT THE SEPARATION DUE TO INCARCERATION CAUSES CANNOT EVER ADEQUATELY BE DESCRIBED WITH WORDS. THIS PAIN IS ONE THAT I CAN ONLY COMPARE TO DEATH BECAUSE ON SO MANY LEVELS EVERYONE INVOLVED SUFFERS SO MUCH LOSS. ANY REPROBATE DAMAGE. WHEN I WAS RELEASED I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE HARDEST PART OF OUR SEPARATION WOULD LAY BEFORE US? I NO LONGER KNEW WHO MY CHILD WHAT. WE WERE STRANGERS. IMAGINE NOT KNOWING YOUR CHILD'S TEACHERS NAME WHAT THEIR FAVORITE COLOR IS OR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS NOT KNOWING HOW TO MAKE A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH THE WAY THEY LIKE. THE ATTACHMENT WAS A BY PRODUCT OF INCARCERATION BECAUSE I KNEW NO OTHER WAY TO GET TROUGH THE PAIN OF NOT THE SCENE. HOLDING OR WATCHING MY DAUGHTER GROW UP ON A DAY BY DAY BASIS THAN TO DETACH MYSELF FROM HER. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE STILL DEAL WITH TO THIS DAY. THE EFFECTS OF MY INCARCERATION ON OUR FAMILY ARE STILL REELING SIX YEARS POST RELEASE. AND IF I'M BEING TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU I'M NOT SURE WHEN THEY WILL EVER GO AWAY. A BILL FOR JUST THREE NINETY FOUR WOULD WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE VERY OPPORTUNITY SAID I WAS TRYING SO DESPERATELY. TO PROVE TO THE COURTS I WAS WORTHY OF I WASN'T ASKING TO GET OFF SCOT FREE. I WAS JUST ASKING FOR A CHANCE TO PROVE THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF MORE. THAT I WAS WORTHY OF MORE. AND THAT SHE WAS WORTHY OF MORE. A LIFE WITH A LITTLE LESS RAUMA. AND THE MOTHER KEPT WITH HER DAUGHTER. WE CAN CONTINUE TO LET THE TRADITION OF YESTERDAY. THEY TAKE THE FATE OF OUR FUTURE -- WE CAN CHALLENGE OURSELVES ELEVATOR POLICIES AND STRATEGIES SENATE AROUND TRUE RESTORATION AND REHABILITATION.

ALTHOUGH THIS BILL GIVES PROSECUTORS DISCRETION TO CREATE A FORMAL DIVERSION PROGRAM. THE JUDGE CAN OVERRIDE THE PROSECUTORS TERMINATION AND INDIVIDUAL CASES. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT CERTAIN MISDEMEANORS SUCH AS CONTACTING A MINOR WITH THE INTENT TO COMMIT SEXUAL SOLD WILL BE SUBJECT TO DIVERSION UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE SPONSOR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. IF YOU MISS MATTHEWS ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WELL THE DALE. OF THE MOTION TO WAIVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. SENATOR JACKSON. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TEST. IT'S REALLY VERY COMPELLING. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HUMAN BEINGS HERE AND TO THE DA'S ASSOCIATION. I KNOW THAT THE BILL PROVIDES A LOT OF DISCRETION THE DA'S IN AT THE FRONT AND I THE I I APPRECIATE THERE MIGHT BE SOME ADDITIONAL BILLS THAT YOU'LL TAKE A GET. THE DISH ALL CRIMES THAT THAT MIGHT THE YOU KNOW NEED TO BE TWEAKED BUT I JUST THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE PROSECUTION SHOULD BE EXCITED ABOUT FIFTY MORE. POWER IF YOU WILL BUT IT'S A POWER TO TRY. TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN ADDRESSING THE FACT THE PEOPLE DO MAKE BAD CHOICES BUT THEY AREN'T NECESSARILY BAD PEOPLE. AND WE ARE I I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COME IN AND WORK HOLISTICALLY WITH PEOPLE AND SO. I KNOW WE HAVE A MOTION AND I JUST WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR SHARING YOUR STORY WITH US.

IF THEY CAN -- GIVE AN ESTIMATE ON OUR OUR FOSTER CARE NUMBERS. AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTIONS THAT OCCUR AS A RESULT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM FROM THIS FAMILY WHO WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL STORIES TODAY. AS WE FIXATE ON THE COST OF SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALWAYS OOK AT THE THE LONGER TERM. PERHAPS ON AN UNINTENTIONAL YET VERY WILL COST TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN FAMILIES ARE RIPPED APART AS A RESULT OF BAD CHOICES A LONG TERM INCARCERATION.

WHEN I PERCENT OF THE BILL IT WAS RATHER -- CLINICAL AND DISPASSIONATE BECAUSE I GAVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES. AROUND WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CHILD OF INCARCERATED HERE WOULD TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT I THINK THERE'S WE HEARD FROM OUR TESTIMONY. THAT WOULD BE THE LEAST OF THE INCARCERATED. OF THE CHILD'S WORRIES OF THE INCARCERATED PARENTS. AND HI I CAN IN ANY WAY. COMMUNICATE WHAT WAS COMMUNICATED BY THE WITNESSES I THINK IT CLEARLY STANDS FOR ITSELF AND I MYSELF AM VERY EMOTIONAL AS RESULT OF HEARING IT BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR SO MANY REASONS. AND I ACTUALLY AM VERY PROUD OF THE SPONSORS FOR CONSTRUCTING IN A WAY THAT DID YOU KNOW I PROBABLY AFTER HEARING SUCH TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE GIVEN LESS DISCRETION TO SOME OF THE AGENCIES BUT I DO. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IF PUBLIC SAFETY IS OUR CONCERN SO -- I THINK IT WAS WELL CONSTRUCTED AND I ASKED FOR EUROPE. Q.
