MOVING ON THE PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR SENATOR JACKSON JACKSON FOR AN INTRODUCTION. AT FROM THE IMPORTANT TO THE MUNDANE. BUT NOT AT ALL. IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE. TO INTRODUCE THE HONORABLE OR LIKE KEEN THE NEWLY APPOINTED CONSUL GENERAL OF IRELAND IN LOS ANGELES. NOW SAN FRANCISCO OTHER THAN HAVING OCCASIONALLY A DECENT FOOTBALL TEAM. AND A FORMERLY GREAT BASKETBALL TEAM BUT THAT'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION SAN FRANCISCO HAS HOSTED AN IRISH CONSULATE GENERAL SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY THREE. AND LAST SEPTEMBER CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO WELCOME A SECOND IRISH CONSULATE. ITS LOCATION IN LOS ANGELES IS FITTING AS IRELAND IS THE SEVENTH LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTOR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THE CONSULATE WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS ON THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES LOCATED THERE. PRIOR TO HER APPOINTMENT AS THE FIRST COUNCIL GENERAL IN LA MS KEANE WORK IN IRELAND'S UNITED NATIONS OFFICE IN GENEVA AND AS PART OF THEIR PERMANENT REPRESENTATION. TO THE EUROPEAN UNION IN BRUSSELS. HER EXTENSIVE RESUME INCLUDES WORK ON A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES AMONG THEM HUMAN RIGHTS IN SOUTH AFRICA THE PEACE PROCESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND BREXIT. IRELAND'S DIPLOMATS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO PARAMOUNT TO THE ORGANIZATION OF A VERY SUCCESSFUL SENATE DELEGATION TO OUR ISLAND THAT I WAS HONORED TO LEAD THIS PAST NOVEMBER. THEIR EFFORTS HELPED ENSURE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT IRELAND'S DATA PROTECTION EFFORTS WORK ON BREXIT. THEIR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND THE CONSULTATION OF GOVERNMENT MODEL WHICH THEY USE I WAS PARTICULARLY INSPIRED. NOT JUST BY THE GREAT IRISH WHISKEY THAT'S PARENTHETICAL IT'S NOT IN MY NOTES AND THE BEST BEER AND GUINNESS STOUT STUFF IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY- WHICH THE IRISH APPRECIATE TIED WOULD SAY IN GREAT MEASURE BUT I WAS PARTICULARLY INSPIRED BY THE THEIR IMPLEMENTATION OF KEY SOCIAL CHANGES. THAT PROMOTED INCLUSIVITY REFERENDUM. WITH REMARKABLE MARGINS THEY LEGALIZE SAME SEX MARRIAGE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND LIBERALIZED REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TRULY THE TIES WE HAVE WITH OUR IRISH FRIENDS ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION- FROM THE FOUNDATION F THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP OR FORM THE FOUNDATION OF THIS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP. NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THE FACT THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS CLAIM IRISH DESCENT AND I MIGHT ADD ON SAINT PATRICK'S DAY IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TEN TIMES THAT AMOUNT. BUT IT IS A ROBUST A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP THAT INCLUDES 15% OF U. S. IMPORTS TO IRELAND COME FROM CALIFORNIA. SO THE VALUE OF OUR PARTNERSHIP IN RELATIONSHIP HERE. IS SIGNIFICANT AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOW A NEW CONSULAR OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES I THINK WE'LL CERTAINLY AT LEAST DOUBLE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE THAT WARM AND WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP. AND NOTICE WE HAVE A WOMAN IN THAT POSITION AND OF COURSE SO IT'S DOUBLY.
