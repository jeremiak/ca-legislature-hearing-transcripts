OF COURSE WE HAD A ROBUST -- HEARING SCHEDULE THIS YEAR ON ON HIGHER AT ISSUES AND ONE OF THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS BUDGET PROPOSALS FROM JANUARY AND FOR MAY AND AND WITH THAT WE SEE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN. GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR OUR UC AND CSU SYSTEM AS WELL AS FINANCIAL AID -- NOT A PERFECT BUDGETS BUT SOMETHING WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF ESPECIALLY FOR IT FOR YOU SEE IN CSU WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER WE'RE ABLE TO FOCUS ON ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY AND CERTAINLY CERTAINLY A QUALITY FOR EXISTING STUDENTS AND WE THINK THIS IS. WHAT WE HEARD FROM OUR ANALYST? THE SECOND LARGEST INCREASE IN IN THE ROD DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S ONE YEAR RIGHT AFTER THE DURING THE DOT COM ERA WE HAD A LARGER -- DOLLAR AMOUNT INCREASE SO WE THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW NOT AS MUCH AS A SYSTEMS ASK FOR BUT ENOUGH TO REALLY FOCUS ON INVESTING IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION -- SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS FOCUSING ON FINANCIAL AID IN THE MAKE SURE THAT COLLEGE IS MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE NOT JUST THE TUITION COSTS WHICH WILL GET. TO IN A BIT SO CERTAINLY -- PLEASED ABOUT THE PACKAGE WE HAVE HERE TODAY -- SO WITH THAT BEFORE WE GET TO THE MAJOR ITEMS WE'RE GOING TO DO A VOTE ONLY. ON SOME OF THESE ITEMS THAT WERE IN THE GOVERNOR'S -- NAY REVISED. AND APRIL FINANCE LETTERS SO THOSE WOULD BE ISSUES THE VOTE ONLY SECTION ISSUES ONE THROUGH. TWENTY SEVEN LOOKING FOR A MOTION ON THAT PACKAGE. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND. THE END -- UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE SOME. OF THE REPUBLICANS MAY WANT TO CALL SOME OUT YOU'RE NOT VOTING ON THAT ACCURATE. THIS IS A PIECE OF THE UC STUFF SO THIS IS THE VOTE ONLY ITEMS. THESE ARE ISSUES ONE THROUGH.

OR WE CAN DO IS WE CAN DO LOOKING VOTE ON IT. AND THEN AFTERWARDS YOU CAN COMMENT AND CLARIFY. WHICH ONES YOU WANT TO BE ADJUSTED FOR WE CAN DO THAT OKAY. SO WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND ON THE VOTE ONLY ITEMS. ISSUES ONE THROUGH TWENTY SEVEN THIS IS -- FOR PR STATE LIBRARY -- WILL TO YOU SEE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW CSU ESTIMATE COMMISSION. NOW PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MCCARTY HI. BRO [inaudible] GALLAGHER [inaudible] I WAS [inaudible] MEDINA [inaudible] MURATSUCHI [inaudible] O'DONNELL. OKAY NOW WE HAVE THE UC PACKAGE AND AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE PLEASED THAT WHERE -- PROVIDING SOME SIGNIFICANT ON GOING FUNDING FOR THE UC AS PROPOSED BY -- THE GOVERNOR AND AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG THIS IS ON PAGE. THIRTEEN THIRTEEN SO OUR PROPOSAL IS -- WE APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- AB TWO HUNDRED FORTY THREE AND A HALF MILLION FOR USE THE ON GOING AND THAT ACTUALLY AT TWO MILLION MORE -- ONE OF THINGS WE DO IS -- WE REJECT THE PROPOSAL FOCUSING ON ACADEMIC QUALITY WILL ACT IN THE CALL IS IMPORTANT. WE WEREN'T CONVINCED OF THE PROPOSAL NORTH THAT THAT THE ACTUAL NEED WE COMPARED TO OTHER -- PRIORITIES -- FOR YOU SEE WHICH WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT SUCH AS ENROLLMENT GROWTH THE ISSUE THAT WE HERE AT HOME MOST ABOUT IS HOW ARE CONSTITUENTS AND GET INTO THE GREAT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA RE DIRECT -- THAT MONEY TO ENROLL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MORE UNDERGRADUATES. AND ONE THOUSAND MORE A GRADUATE STUDENT SO. THAT CERTAINLY WILL HELP OUR OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE. MORE AND MORE ELIGIBLE AND READY TO GO TO THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA -- WE ALSO -- ARE PROVIDING ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NINETY FIVE MILLION AND ONE TIME THIS IS SOMEWHAT DISCRETIONARY MONEY FOR THE UC I KNOW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HOPE THIS WAS ON GOING BUT YOU KNOW ALL WE HAVE IN THIS. THE ARCHITECTURE THE BUDGET IS ONE TIME RESOURCES SO YOU KNOW THAT I THINK WILL CERTAINLY HELP YOU SEE DEAL WITH THEIR ISSUES AND SO THE OVERALL -- BUDGET FOR THE UC ONE TIME IS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ARE ON A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. ISSUES IN SEISMIC WE KNOW THAT SAID A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AT ALL OF THE THE NINE YOU SEE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES PLUS THE TENTH OF UC SAN FRANCISCO -- ONE THING WE ARE ADDING THIS YEAR IS WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH SOME CAMPUSES AND SOME -- PHILANTHROPY ACROSS THE STATE TO PROVIDE A NEW EFFORT FOR SEISMIC TO ALLOW. MORE MONEY TO GO TO CAMPUS IS ON A MATCHING BASIS SO IF INDIVIDUALS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL CAN PROVIDE MONEY FOR THIS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WILL. ALLOW US TO STRETCH THE SCARCE DOLLARS AGAIN OUR BIGGEST -- BANG FOR THE BUCK TO DEAL WITH OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND AND SEISMIC NEEDS AND THEN LASTLY. WE'RE GOING -- TO CAN FORM WITH THE SENATE ACTION RELATED -- TO CALIFORNIAN ROMANS AND NON RESIDENTS ENROLLMENTS -- THROUGHOUT THE EAST UC SYSTEM'S BEEN UP CERTAINLY A HOT ISSUE. WITHIN THE STATE CAPITOL ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND CONVERSELY MORE SOMETIMES WE GET MORE AND MORE ACCESS FOR NON CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND SO. WE'RE COMMITTING COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU SEE TO ENSURE THIS -- REDUCTION DOESN'T FINANCIALLY HARM THE CAMPUSES SO THIS IS. A A MULTI YEAR PLAN -- PREDICATED ON OF COURSE MONEY IN EACH BUDGET YEAR BUT WITH THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING TO BEGAN HAVING A TENYEAR REDUCTION IN NON. RESIDENT ENROLLMENT STARTING NEXT YEAR. SO WITH THAT THAT'S A A SUMMARY OF THE UC PACKAGE AND WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS FROM MISTER -- MEDINA THE MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER GALLAGHER. SO ON ON THE FLOOR YESTERDAY -- AS UCLA CELEBRATED ITS ONE HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY -- ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF UCLA BEING IN EXISTENCE WE HEARD FROM MANY MEMBERS. OF HOW PROUD THEY ARE OF UCLA AND THE GREAT WORK THE GREAT UNIVERSITY THAT UCLA IS. AND NOT BEING AT UCLA GRAD MYSELF. I I I THINK THE SAME CAN BE SAID. FOR ALL THE UC CAMPUSES I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYONE IS ANY -- YOU KNOW I THINK THEY'RE ALL EQUAL AND AND EXCELLENCE ALL OF THEM ALL TEN UC CAMPUSES SO AS WE HEARD THAT. ON THE FLOOR YESTERDAY -- WE HEARD AN OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT. OF FROM MEMBERS ON ON HOW IMPORTANT YOU SEE IS TO CALIFORNIA AND HOW PROUD. WE ARE OF OUR UC SYSTEM. SO I AM HAPPY THAT WE HAVE THE NINETY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME AS THE CHAIR SAID. AND LOOK FORWARD TO IT BECOMING ON GOING IN THE YEARS TO COME AND I WILL BE -- ADVOCATING FOR THAT IN IN IN THE YEAR NEXT YEAR AS WELL SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION -- ON GOING. THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YES SIR MR MY TEACHING THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JOIN THE THE CHAIR OF A THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND AND BEING PROUD OF OUR UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AND I YOU KNOW. BELIEVE THAT -- THAT -- OUR UNIVERSITIES -- ARE ARE CAN'T UC CAMPUSES ARE AMONG THE THE BEST -- CONSISTENTLY RANK AMONG THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY -- IN A WITH MULTIPLE CAMPUSES ARE ON THOSE LISTS OF THE BEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY AND AND WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE MAINTAIN THAT. I I WOULD LIKE [inaudible] TO RESPECTFULLY -- PUT A DIFFERENT SPIN AND THEN THE THAN THE SUB COMMITTEE CHAIR IN IN IN IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT -- FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ARM YOU KNOW WE ARE PROVIDING A RECORD AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OUR GENERAL FUND BUDGET IS AT A RECORD HIGH. AND BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PROPORTION OF OUR GENERAL FUND -- THAT IS GOING TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- IT NOT ONLY IS IT NOT WHAT -- IT HAS BEEN BEFORE OUR LAST TWO RECESSIONS BUT AS WE DISCUSSED AT OUR LAST -- BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING -- ARE. THE STE STATE CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CORE FUNDS HAS DROPPED FROM ABOUT 70%. TO NOW ABOUT 40%. THEN AND WHAT I'M CONCERNED IS THAT YOUR NUMBER. ONE THE IT. I NOW THAT. AS A CHERRY -- TALKED ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BUDGET IS IS IS ALL COMING TOGETHER. YOU KNOW. WITH WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE OF OF OUR OVERALL BUDGET IN COMING TOGETHER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ASK WAS. RELATIVELY MODEST THEY WERE ASKING -- FOR NOT ONLY THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT AN ADDITIONAL -- INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS -- AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OVERALL -- BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR OF TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN -- A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS I I FIND IT. YOU KNOW DISAPPOINTED THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COME UP WITH THAT ADDITIONAL -- HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS -- I I JUST THINK IT'S JUST A REMINDER TO ALL OF US THAT. THAT AS WE'RE WE'RE GOING FORWARD -- ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL -- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN SOMETIME IN THE NEXT. THREE TO FIVE YEARS -- IF WE'RE LUCKY -- IF NOT SOONER -- YOU WHERE WHERE WHERE AND AS WERE TAKING ON NEW -- GENERAL FUND OBLIGATIONS -- THROUGH SOME OF THE NEW PRIORITIES THAT -- THIS GOVERNOR AND AND ARE LEGISLATURE IS IS LOOKING AT WE'RE SETTING OURSELVES UP AT IT ONCE AGAIN FOR ANOTHER ECONOMIC DOWNTURN -- WERE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION IS YOU KNOW BIG BECAUSE PUBLIC IRISH EDUCATION IS NOT. PROTECTED IN THE FUN THROUGH -- MECHANISM LIKE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT THAT WE'RE SETTING OURSELVES UP FOR YOU -- YET ANOTHER DISPROPORTIONATE -- IMPACT ON PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION THE FACT THAT WE COULD NOT RESTORE MORE -- DURING THESE GOOD BUDGET YEARS -- AS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME -- SO. I WILL BE SUPPORTING TODAY'S BUDGET RELUCTANTLY -- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK -- DOWN THE LINE IN TERMS OF HOW TO HOW HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE -- YOU KNOW WALKING THE TALK WHEN WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FULLY FUNDING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NOT FULLY FUNDED THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE HAVE WERE FAR FROM. WHERE WE USED TO BE WHERE WE SHOULD BE -- AND AND SO MISTER CHAIR I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO A TO CONTINUE -- TOWARD THIS EFFORT. THANK YOU. YEAH MR GALLAGHER YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS OVER UC'S BUDGET -- IN THE IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS THIS YEAR AND I AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT THE THAT WE AGREE ON AND I THINK THAT. IN THIS IN THIS PACKAGE WE'VE -- WE'VE BROUGHT TOGETHER A LOT OF THINGS THAT I THINK WE WANT TO HELP -- ONE HELP STEER INDIRECT. OF THE FUTURE OF OF YOU SEE -- IN IN A WAY THAT THAT I THINK. MOST OF US AGREE IS MORE RESPONSIBLE -- YOU KNOW WHERE I WHERE I DIVERT A LITTLE BIT AND I'LL I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT -- IS LOOK I'M A VERY PROUD UC GRADUATE MYSELF -- AND I'M PROUD OF THAT UNIVERSITY IN BECAUSE I'M PROUD OF THAT SYSTEM -- I CANNOT CAN ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE TO RUN THE WAY THAT IT IS. I CANNOT ALLOW THE STATUS QUO. OF HOW THAT UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS BEING OPERATED TO CONTINUE. AND SO FOR ONE I'M GOING TO DIVERGE FROM CONTINUING THIS THIS GAME OF APPROVING ENROLLMENT NUMBERS ONLY GET NO DATA -- JUST BASICALLY RIGHT IN A BLANK CHECK ON ENROLLMENT NUMBERS -- IN THE UC SYSTEM. WITHOUT BEING PROVIDED ANY ANY REAL HARD DATA AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY INTEND TO ENROLL IN A GIVEN YEAR. AND WHEN WE STILL DON'T REALLY HAVE STRONG ASSURANCES THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET. THE AMOUNT OF IN STATE STUDENTS. ENROLLED IN OUR UC SYSTEM WHICH WAS THE GOAL OF THE MASTER PLAN -- BUT THE OTHER GOAL THE MASTER PLAN WAS NOT TO MAKE YOU SEE. THE BIG ENROLLMENT -- THAT UNIVERSITY AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT MONEY IS BETTER SPENT. ON OUR CSU SYSTEM WHOSE ACTUALLY BEING RESPONSIVE TO US IN THIS OF FAT IN THIS AFFECT. WHOSE ACTUALLY ENSURING THAT WE ARE GIVING OPPORTUNITIES. TO STUDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. MUCH BETTER THAN THE UC SYSTEM IS RIGHT NOW -- SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING -- THESE MEASURES THE CONTINUOUS DOWN THAT PATH OF JUST KIND OF OPENING UP THE THE ENROLLMENT -- FUNDING FOR THE UC I THINK. ON THE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING I BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD STEP WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS EVENTUALLY DO IS NOT DO THIS PIECEMEAL AND SORT OF PARTNER WITH. COUNTY -- K. THROUGH TWELVE ANOTHER HIGHER ED PROGRAMS. TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH -- PROGRAM -- SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AT SOME POINT -- I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING SOME GOOD THINGS IN TERMS OF CAL GRANTS -- THE OTHER. ISSUE THAT I WANTED. TO POINT OUT IS AYE AYE. I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT WERE REJECTING THE THE FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES -- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US GET SOME MORE DETAIL ON TO WHAT THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION. THAT WE'RE GONNA RE DIRECT IS GOING INTO -- IN A HOLE FOR THAT'LL GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR THEIR FRESH FLESHED OUT AS WE MOVE. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS -- BUT I THINK PUTTING IT ALL INTO A ROOM AND IS IS IS NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT -- FIX CERTAINLY WERE WE ARE DOING SOME THINGS TO TO ADDRESS FACILITIES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT TO ME IS A VERY BIG ISSUE THAT YOU SEE RIGHT NOW. IS ENSURING THAT YOU HAVE THE FACILITIES. LONG TERM. THAT ARE MAINTAINED AND THAT WE HAVE IN THAT WE HAVE SERVICES FOR THE STUDENTS. THAT INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH THAT INCLUDES HEALTH -- AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT EVEN DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND YOU SEE RIGHT NOW. AND YET WE'RE SAYING HEY GO AND YOU KNOW LET'S READ A BLANK CHECK TO ENROLL MORE STUDENTS -- THERE'S SOME GOOD THINGS IN HERE THE SEISMIC RETROFIT MONEY SEISMIC RETROFIT MONEY I THINK IS IS VITAL FOR MANY OF THE UC CAMPUSES. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND OTHER FACILITIES ARE GOING TO BE. IN GOOD SHAPE LONG TERM -- SO I THINK THAT'S POSITIVE -- THEN YOU KNOW I DO LIKE THE LANGUAGE ENSURING THAT WE GET TO REDUCE NON RESIDENT ROMA 210% -- BUT CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW. I KNOW WE NEED TO SEE SOME RESPONSIVENESS OF THE UC SYSTEM BETTER RESPONSIVENESS AND I THINK. WE HAVE SEEN SO I THINK WE'RE DOING MANY THINGS THAT WE ALL AGREE. NEED TO BE DONE TO TO MOVE THE YOU SEE IN A BETTER DIRECTION -- I THINK I THINK WHAT WE ALSO DID HERE IS WE REJECTED THIS YOU KNOW THIS OUT RIGHT. HEY PLEASE JUST PAY FOR ALL OF OUR SALARY INCREASES -- WITH BASICALLY NO DISCRETION WHATSOEVER -- WE REJECTED THAT PROPOSAL I THINK IN ESSENCE BY NOT PROVIDING THAT FULL LAST AMOUNT -- FOR ME SEE -- AND WE PUT AND WE'RE PUTTING THE MONEY INTO PLACES WHERE WE KNOW IT IS NEEDED FACILITIES -- EXCEPT HER SO. WITH THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW I'M IN A SUPPORT MANY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WITH A FEW THAT I WILL BE. VOTING NO ON THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CLEAR ENOUGH. THANK YOU -- DO BEFORE WE TAKE THAT THE VOTE HERE JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT A FEW THAT WERE TOUCHED UPON THE AND REALLY HIGHLIGHT -- TOO MUCH. IS WE HEARD. NOT JUST THE OVERALL IN ROMAN AND QUALITY ISSUES BUT SO MUCH NOW WITH STUDENTS THAT THE THE BASIC NEEDS. DEALING WITH -- RAPPER HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING OF TWO FIVE FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP OTHER GOING TO SCHOOL STUDENT HUNGER -- MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THINK THAT WE'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS AND A SMART WAY HERE. AND WITH THAT I KNOW THAT YOU SAID MR DOLLAR TO BE HAVING SOME COORDINATION WITH OTHER PROGRAMS AND ONE THING THAT WE DID HERE WHICH I THINK IS VERY POSITIVE AS WE TOOK SOME MONEY OFF THE TOP. OF THE PROP SIXTY THREE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM RECOGNIZING THAT COLLEGE MENTAL HEALTH STOOD MENTAL HEALTH IS THE KEY SUCCESS. FOR COLLEGE SUCCESS AND SO WE HAVE THAT NOT JUST FOR YOU SEE BUT FOR CSU. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SO. THE FEAR FOR TAKE A VOTE THIS IS IN A A PERFECT YOU SEE BUDGET FOR THE ADVOCATES BUT I WILL SAY. IS BETTER THAN THE SENATE VERSION AS BETTER IN THE GOVERNOR'S VERSION SO WE ARE LEADING THE WAY IN INVESTING IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO. REMEMBER THAT. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED TODAY -- DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES -- CHILD CARE HEALTH CARE ADVOCATES ARE SOMETIMES GETTING THE BIG GOOSE EGG ON THEIR REQUEST IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. SO FOR THOSE WHO WHO WHO SAY THAT WE COULD BE DOING MORE THAT'S TRUE BUT I THINK WE NEED. TO KEEP IN PERSPECTIVE AND YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GO NOW SO VOTERS WHAT THEY WANT TO PAY FOR EDUCATION TO THEY WANT TO BE. FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION AND FOR PEOPLE FUNDING THEY WANT TO HAVE OUR OUR HIGHER ED SYSTEM. THAT'S THAT'S LAGGING BEHIND US ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY AND SO YOU KNOW ABSENT SHUTTING DOWN ALL TEN STATE PRISONS ARE SHUTTING DOWN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND AND CLOSING ALL CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS IN. DIFFERING THOSE FUNDS OVER HERE -- I DON'T SEE THOSE PROPOSALS BEFORE US TODAY SO WE HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS AND SO -- THAT'S A WERE -- VOTING ON THIS AFTERNOON OR THIS MORNING. AND WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION IS SECONDS AND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] TAKES. OKAY SEC -- DID YOU WANT TO BEFORE WE CALL THE ROLL.
