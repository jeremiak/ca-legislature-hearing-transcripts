TO HELPED AND SAID THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE A LOT GOING ON TODAY SO I'LL MAKE MY OPENING STATEMENTS REALLY. VERY BRIEF- I QUICKLY WANT TO JUST TAKE KNOWLEDGE AND SAY THANK YOU TO MY PARENTS AND FIVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO. ARE WATCHING FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TODAY- AND EXTEND A VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO MY HUSBAND AND OUR AMAZING TWO CHILDREN WHO ARE SITTING NEXT TO ME TODAY. AND IT IS THEIR UNWAVERING SUPPORT THAT HAS ALLOWED ME TO DEDICATE SO MUCH OF MY ENERGY TO SERVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I AM SO DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE TO MY FAMILY SUPPORT. I'M SO WITH THAT I JUST I WANT TO OPEN BY AND MAKING A QUICK STATEMENT IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.I'M AS YOU ALL KNOW ONLY TOO WELL CALIFORNIA IS AT A CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL CROSSROADS. THIS YEAR ALONE WILDFIRES DROUGHT AND EXTREME HEAT. ARE ALL LOUDLY SINGLE SIGNALING THAT OUR CLIMATE IS NOT ONLY CHANGING BUT HAS CHANGED. AND WE CAN NO LONGER DELAY OR MITIGATION EFFORTS AND WE NEED TO QUICKLY BECOME A MORE RESILIENT CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LONG LED THE NATION IN PROGRESSIVE RECYCLING WASTE LOTS AND WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. AND A CONVERSATION JUST THIS MORNING WITH A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. WE TALKED ABOUT A LANDFILL THAT WAS DUE TO REACH CAPACITY AND CLOSE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE. BUT NOW IS NOWHERE NEAR THAT FULL CAPACITY AND THAT IS INCREDIBLE PROGRESS HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO. MUCH MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IN THIS COUNTRY NEAR 4% OF THE FOOD PRODUCED NOT EATEN. BUT RATHER ENDS UP IN OUR LANDFILLS. TURNING INTO METHANE EIGHTY FOUR TIMES MORE POTENT. THAN CARBON. ORGANIC WASTE INCLUDING FOOD ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY HALF OF WHAT WE DISPOSE OF HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR MOST RECENT NUMBERS SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA THREW AWAY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION TONS OF ORGANIC WASTE. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. 12% OF OUR RESTRAINT WAS PLASTICS THAT'S OVER FOUR MILLION TIMES IN A SINGLE YEAR. WE ARE DIVERTING AND RECYCLING NEED TO DO BETTER AND MUCH MUCH BETTER. I BELIEVE IS A STATE WE ARE WELL POISED TO NOT ONLY DO BETTER REDUCE OUR WASTE AND LESSEN OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT TO TURN OUR WASTE INTO A RESOURCE AND USE IT TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC STRONGER FUTURE PROOFING OUR ECONOMY AND OUR EXCITEMENT AND LEAVING HEALTHIER STRONGER STATE TO THE NEXT GENERATION. OUR CHILDREN. HOW CYCLE HAS A CRITICAL CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY BY LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A TRUE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND EVENTUALLY AND ZERO WASTE ECONOMY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY WORKING WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE. TO ATTRACT NEW INNOVATIVE COMPANIES NEW JOBS AND NEW INDUSTRIES THAT SHARE OUR VISION OF AND NEVER ENDING LIFE CYCLE FOR OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS. I BELIEVE MY LIFE AND CAREER EXPERIENCE HAS PREPARED ME AND LED ME TO THIS MOMENT TO HELP CALIFORNIA DO JUST THAT I GREW UP UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE VALUE OF OUR RESOURCES. MY FAMILY FATHER'S FAMILY ARRIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK AND MY MOTHER'S FAMILY GREW UP ON A MIDWESTERN FARM. ALL LIVED AND WORKED THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE WORLD WARS AND TAUGHT US. TO NEVER WASTE ANYTHING WE GREW UP GROWING OUR OWN FOOD COMPOSTING RECYCLING ALL FROM AN EARLY AGE AND BEING ONE OF SIX CHILDREN CAN BE DOWNS WERE OUR VERSION OF NEW CLOTHES. AND I STILL LOOK FORWARD TO MY OLDER SISTER SANDY DISCOUNTS WHEN NAY COME ABOUT. AND WHAT IT IS NEARLY MY TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN PUBLIC SERVICE WITH BEST LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR THAT I BELIEVE HIS POSITION ME TO TAKE ON THIS CHALLENGE AND WORK WITH YOU. TO BUILD A TRUE CIRCULAR ECONOMY THAT WILL LEAD OUR STATE. OUR NATION AND OUR PLANET. WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND I AM WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MEDEVACED HERE GIVEN THAT I KNOW YOU WERE GONNA HAVE TO STEP WAIT A MINUTE DO WOULD YOU LIKE TO START ON THIS ONE AND THEN WE'LL GO TO SENATOR LAYERED IF THAT'S- OKAY. ABSOLUTELY ESPECIALLY WITH THE FOR A YOUNG LADY WHO I KNOW WELL FOR ENOUGH. A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS THE- CONSULTANT ON THAT YOU GET COMMITTEE RIDE COMMISSION WAGNER SO. GREAT TO SEE YOU- I OF. I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PILOT PROGRAM SNOWING UP OF RECYCLING PROGRAM REALLY HIT. YOU KNOW THE WALLS- COUPLE YEARS AGO- WITH THE- YOU KNOW CHINESE NOT ACCEPTING OUR- ARE. RECYCLED MATERIAL ETCETERA ETCETERA AND THEN A- COUPLE BILLS PASSED ACTUALLY WAS SB FOUR FIFTY EIGHT AND A B. FIFTY FOUR WHICH I DID SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH FOR PILOT PROGRAMS AND THERE'S A REPORT YOU I BELIEVE IN JANUARY ARE COMING UP. BUT CAN YOU GIVE US ANY OF THE LITTLE PEEKABOO NOW ON HOW THOSE HAVE WORKED IN TERMS OF INCENTIVIZING OUR- RECYCLING. EFFORTS AGAIN- AS WE RECEIVED SO MANY COMPLAINTS FROM CONSTITUENTS AND YOU KNOW. THAT THERE WASN'T ANY PLACE AND THEY WERE STILL SAVING ALL OF THEIR- RECYCLABLE MATERIAL SO HOW'S THAT WORKING AND NOW IT DOESN'T. GIVE A **** ANY RAY OF HOPE. WELL I'LL- YOU PRINT SENATOR SO I'M FIRST INFORM I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PILOT PROJECTS AND I BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SUPPORTED SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR US TO- AND EXECUTES MEDICINAL PILOT PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE AND I THINK THIS IS A REAL. OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA AND CAL RECYCLED TO LOOK AT AND- TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER INNOVATIVE WAYS WHERE WE CAN BREAK THE LOGJAM ON AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AROUND. BOTTLING HAND AND BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING IN CALIFORNIA I WILL SAY THAT. I WOULD PROJECTS THAT HAD AND THEN OPERATIONS OUR OUR AND WE'RE A LITTLE SLOW AND THE PANDEMIC SLOWED EVERYTHING DOWN AND SAY OH I THINK WE NOW HAVE ALL SIGNS. THAT ARE FULLY FUNDED AND WORKING ON THEIR LUNCHES BUT THEY ALL ARE TESTING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES- AND DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO SEE I HAD AND WHAT THEY COME UP WITH BUT IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER. UNTIL WE SEE THE OUTCOMES THE PANDEMIC REALLY AND AS YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAVING THEIR BOTTLES AND CANS. AND IT REALLY AND INHIBITED STARTING ANYTHING NEW AT BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THOSE FIVE JURISDICTIONS. TO YOU- LAUNCH THEIR PILOT PROJECTS AND THEN WORKING WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS. I'M IN SOME OF OUR UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED PARTS OF THE STATE LIKE UP IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY I'M SOME AREAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY Q. LOOKED TO THOSE JURISDICTIONS AND SIGNED EXCITING OPPORTUNITY AND HAVE COME TO US AND SAID IF YOU GET ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION WE WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE SO WE ARE IN THE EARLY CONVERSATIONS. WITH SOME OTHER JURISDICTIONS ABOUT HI EXCITING NEW IDEAS AND TO IN INCREASE OUR. AND OUR BOTTLE AND CAN RECYCLING. GOOD NEWS THERE WILL BE YOU ARE THINK AND- AWAITING ON FROM THE DAY YOU MAY MORE TO IS WHAT I'M HEARING ARE TO HAVE A REAL ACCURATE COUNT IS WHETHER WE- YOU KNOW WE FELL TO A LITTLE BELOW 70% AND WE STARTED OUT- IN THE EIGHTY PERCENT. THAT WAS REALLY AN EXCITING THING I REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS. REQUIRED WAS AB WITH OF AB EIGHTY NINE I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER BUT AND I WE HAD JUST STARTED OUR CITY AND- THERE WAS GRUMBLING ABOUT IT. BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE KIDS AT SCHOOL OUR CHILDREN WERE WERE BEING EDUCATED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BRING THAT HOME IT GAROFALO VERY INVOLVED TOO SO. GOOD PROGRAM ARE ONE OTHER QUICK QUESTION. THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS HAS REALLY AREN'T I THINK. I DAHLE THE MOLE THE MARKET OR THE IN THE INTEREST OF BUSINESSES WANTING TO INCREASE RECYCLING- MARKETING CALIFORNIA ARE YOU TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE MIGHT. RE OFFEND TO VICE- OUR BUSINESSES WASN'T HE I'M TRYING TO MEMBER THAN THE NAME OF THE BUSINESS THAT WAS REALLY AT THE HEADWATERS AND THEY QUIT DOING BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE CAR OFF TÃI IT WAS. ACTUALLY ON MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO TO DO WITH. THE RECYCLING ALL PROGRAMS FAN ARE WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY RECEIVING IN TERMS OF REMUNERATION SO IF YOU CAN DIE SHARE SOME THOUGHT SHE MIGHT. BE LOOKING OUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE WHOLE. ISSUE WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SENATOR I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK IS EXACTLY THE CONVERSATION THAT I WANT TO HAVE WITH ALL OF YOU AND LEGISLATURE. I'M AROUND AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SUPPORTED IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND ON THE ON GOING CONVERSATION THIS YEAR AROUND HOW DO WE BUILD THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA. WE AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED SPENDING SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. AND MEANT SPECIFICALLY TO FILL THE GAPS AND REALLY MAKE CALIFORNIA A COMPETITIVE PLACE FOR RECYCLING AND REMANUFACTURING. AND ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT IS AND AS I ASKED YOU GOT VERY EXCITED ABOUT IS A VERY SMALL PROPOSAL THAT WE HAD. THAT WOULD HELP WITH FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENT AND BUSINESS PLANS FOR INNOVATIVE BUSINESSES IN RECYCLING. AND REMANUFACTURING AND AS YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND- IN THE PAST. OFTENTIMES THE BIGGEST HURDLE INTO STARTING A BUSINESS IS GETTING THAT INITIAL SUPPORT AND SO. WE HAVE I'M SPENT THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE I CAME ON BOARD REALLY TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE GAPS IN THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT CALIFORNIA CAN STEP IN AND CREATE INCENTIVES. AND SUPPORT FOR OUR BUSINESSES THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES WE'D LIKE TO SEE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS AND- WITH THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE. AND I THINK IT'S A VERY VERY EXCITING AREA WHERE THERE IS MARKED IMPROVEMENT. TO BE MADE BUT MARKED IMPROVEMENT THAT WE CAN MAKE. THAT'S GREAT NEWS AND CERTAIN YOU'LL BE. LEGISLATORS AND SOME OF THOSE PLANS WITHOUT I THINK THE PARTNERSHIP THAT'S GOING FORWARD THAT WE'VE SEEN AND ON THE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE. ON SOME OF THE ISSUES SOME OF THEM CONTENTIOUS BUT OTHER STUFF. HAVE FROM THE REAL INNOVATIVE THINKING ON ON HOW TO MAKE IT A PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE- I ASKED WE HAD OUR WE DIDN'T HAVE THE RECENT MEETING THAT. I'M TRYING TO THINK THAT WAS JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO PRETTY CLOSE. EVERYTHING IS BLURRED WITH PROVISION WE HAD SOME GREAT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT SO IT'S A- SUPER TO SEE THAT ON THE TOP OF YOUR LIST OF THE- GOALS TO ACHIEVE IN THIS FIRST YEAR SO. OUR CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION AND- YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SO MUCH APPRECIATED AND IF I DON'T SEE YOU HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON WITH THE- THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR CENTER LAYERED YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'M GONNA PICK UP WHERE. SENATOR BATES LEFT OFF AND THANK YOU FOR I WILL ASK MYSELF TO SAY IT WAS MY LANDFILLS YOU WERE REFERRING TO. US OUT OF OUR DISCUSSION BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE WHEN I WENT ON THE CITY COUNCIL ALMOST EIGHT EIGHTY FORTY YEARS AGO IT SEEMS LIKE EIGHTY ALMOST FORTY YEARS AGO THE CITY MANAGER SAYS. IF YOU STAY HERE LONG ENOUGH WE HAVE TWENTY YEARS LIFE ON OUR LANDFILL YOU WILL BE HERE FOR THE CLOSURE ACTIVITIES IN THE CITING THE NEXT LANDFILLS AND NOW FORTY YEARS LATER THE LANDFILL THAT HAD TWENTY YEARS LIFE ON IT HAS THIRTY THREE YEARS LIFE ON IT AND THE REASON. THAT IT'S GONE THAT WAY AND HAS EXPANDED LARGEST PROGRAM YOU ARE ADMINISTERING BUT THEN IT RAISES QUESTIONS AND ONE OF THEM WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. IS THE BILL THAT THAT SENATOR BATES REFERRED TO THAT WAS PASSED IN IT IN THE LATE. DROWNED OUT. TRYING DOWNTURN THIS OFF. IT HAPPENED DOT ORG OUR CAUCUS RETREAT AND IT WAS JERRY BROWN AND EVERYBODY WAS SITTING AROUND ME IN A PLACE THAT'S OKAY HE CALLED THE REST OF US AFTER YOU DIDN'T HEAR. EXACTLY. AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT ABOUT OF EACH. AND SO THE THING ABOUT IT IS THE TIP FEE THAT WAS IN THAT INITIAL BILL FUNDED DIVERSION RATE THE- TO CHANGE SO DRAMATICALLY AND SUCCESS ARE COMES WITH LOSING YOUR FUNDING SOURCE THE MORE YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL THE LAST FUNDING YOU CASH BECAUSE IT CAME FROM THE TIP FEE TO FUND SO NOW THAT YOU'RE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL YOU DON'T HAVE- OF. THAT TO DO OUR PART HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH OUT OVER TIME. AND IF YOU WANT TO DIPLOMATICALLY SAY THE LEGISLATURE COULD HELP US I'M. HOW YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH THEM. YEAH YOU READ MY MIND SENATOR LARRY AS A GOOD FORMER LEGISLATIVE STAFFER I KNOW TO NEVER STEP INTO THE WORLD OF APPROPRIATIONS SPREAD OUT I HAVE WITH OUT FULL BACK UP OF MY- OF THE LEGISLATURE AND BUT I THINK YOU KNOW AS WE DISCUSSED THIS MORNING THIS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE THAT. AND YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO WORK OUR CYCLE AND ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES ASSIGNED TO BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY WASTE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AS PROGRAMS THAT HELP. BUILD AND MAINTAIN COMPOSTING FACILITIES RECYCLING FACILITIES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS EFFORTS THOSE ARE I'M PRIMARILY FUNDED AND RUN THE AND THAT THE TIPSY SIGNED BINDING AND SO I THINK THAT IT IS SOMETHING IN THERE UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW THAT FUND IS VERY HEALTHY THIS WAS A VERY HIGH DISPOSAL YEAR AS- WE HONOR- AND KEVIN WOULD BRING. AND BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT AND HOPEFULLY AT AND I THINK AND AUSPICIOUSLY WILL DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE COMING YEARS AND WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO FIND THAT ANY EFFORTS THAT ARE HELPING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND HELPING OUR COMMUNITIES I'M AND- WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INTENSELY DECREASING AT. THE EIGHT NOW THEY WERE DISPOSING UP. AND THEN I I'VE APPRECIATE AND IT'S THAT WILL WORK ON THAT. ANOTHER THING WE TALKED ABOUT AND I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR BECAUSE I WAS ON THE WAY SUPPORT FOR A YEAR AND WHEN I WAS ON THE WHITE BOARD WITH OUR PLASTIC RECYCLING. WE WERE REALLY GOOD AT TAKING THE PLASTIC INTO THE RECYCLING AND WE HAD MANUFACTURERS THAT WANTED TO USE THE PALLETS AND REUSE IT. BUT WE DID NOT HAVE THE PEOPLE IN BETWEEN TO MANUFACTURE THE RECYCLING TO THE BALANCE. AND THEN IN THE CIRCULAR PART OF IT WE WERE MISSING THE MIDDLE PART. ARM IS THAT STILL A PROBLEM AND IF THAT'S STILL A PROBLEM HOW DO YOU SUGGEST WE ADDRESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR LARRY THAT IS DISTINCTLY THE PROBLEM THAT AND I CAME ON BOARD. AND TO ADDRESS UNFORTUNATELY EVERY TEN YEARS WE HAVE NOT FOUND THE MAGIC BULLET THAT WILL. WILL ADDRESS THAT SITUATION I'M SO EITHER IN MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE. I AND AS A COMMITTEE CONSULTANT I COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE GAPS THAT EXISTED IN OUR SYSTEM BUT I COULDN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WERE AND STILL COMING ON BOARD AS DIRECTOR SIX MONTHS AGO MY TOP ONE OF MY TOP GOALS. AND AS MANY ONE OF MY DOUBLES WAS IDENTIFIED THE SPECIFIC APPS. AND AS AND YOU ALL KNOW IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE WERE SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THOSE WERE VERY MUCH MEANT. TO START TO ADDRESS TO LAY THE FOUNDATION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE GAPS. IN RECYCLING AND CREATING THIS THE TRUE CIRCULARITY AND- AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS AND HE BURKE HOLDING. I'M IN CALIFORNIA WE CREATE A LOT OF CYBER. THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD GET RECYCLED AND WE ALSO HAVE AND SOME REMANUFACTURING HERE AS RECYCLED FIBER THAT HAPPENS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING IS ACTUALLY RECYCLING FIBER AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOST OUT ON SEVERAL COMPANIES. AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE FEEDSTOCK WAS HERE. AND THEN ENDED UP GOING TO OTHER STATES AND THAT JUST MADE MORE BUSINESS SENSE FOR THEM SO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO BUILD PROGRAMS THAT DRAW THOSE COMPANIES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE RECYCLING THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO RECYCLE. AND PROVIDING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS UNITIES I'M THE JOBS IN COMMUNITIES THE WAY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM BUILT AND BUILDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND REALLY. LAID THE GROUNDWORK AND DEFINITION OF WHAT A TRUE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS WHICH IS NOT JUST RECYCLING. RECYCLING IN A WAY THAT THEN SETS THE COMMUTER AND THE- AND THEN. WE TALK A LITTLE BIT TODAY WHAT'S STATUS OF TIRE RECYCLING AT THIS. I DIDN'T GET THAT NUMBER SENATORS THANK YOU FOR ASKING. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE HE ASKED ME FOR HOW MUCH WE RECYCLE AND I DIDN'T HAVE T OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WHICH I WAS A LITTLE EMBARRASSED ABOUT BECAUSE I LITERALLY HAD READ OUR AND DRAFT HIGHER PLANNED. TWO DAYS AGO. I'M THAT I'M TOLD. IS AND- GENERATING FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN. JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TONS. OF TIRES- WE ARE DIVERTING ABOUT EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. I'M FROM LANDFILLS IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT WAS DOWN FROM 92% WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE. AND YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF RECYCLING. AND WE'RE RECYCLING ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. AND I WILL STATE THAT THE SILVER LINING. WELL FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY I'D LIKE TO BE DOING A LOT BETTER. AND TIRES HOWEVER AS YOU KNOW ARE VERY CHALLENGING MATERIAL. I'M AND BY BETTER I WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY HELPFUL AND- IS NOT PERPETUATING AT PRACTICES THAT AREN'T GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT I WILL SEE THE SILVER LINING IS THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS SPENT INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL. AND IN DIVERTING FROM LANDFILLS. AND CUTTING WAY BACK AND- THEY ILLEGAL DISPOSAL OF TIRES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IN THE CREATION OF THIS PROGRAM. WAS CUTTING WAY BACK ON THAT AND NUMBER OF. FIRES I'M FROM STOCKPILED TYRES. AND WE HAVE NOT YET. AND WHEN SHE SAYS BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN A FIRE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE TRACY FIRE. I'M SINCE THE INS AND COMMENCEMENT OF THIS PROGRAM. AND SO I'LL TAKE THAT AS A HUGE SUCCESS BUT UCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. NUMBER AND- WHAT WENT HERE WE TALK ABOUT TIRES AND WE'RE RECYCLING AND ONE SILO AND- WE HAVE ELECTRONICS THAT WE RECYCLE. IN A SILO. OR HAVE EXTENDED PRODUCER OF PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY SILO. HOW DO WE MOVE TO EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD IT JUST NOT IN SILOS. OR OR LET'S JUST SAY BROADER. THAT RATHER THAN A CAR THE HOW DO WE DEAL WITH WHOLE ISSUE EXTEND PRODUCER. THANKS SUCH INCREDIBLY. MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION FOR ME AND I THINK THAT IS WHY WE REALLY WANT TO START THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW DO WE BUILD A CIRCULARECONOMY A TRUE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE IT TO A PLACE WHERE MANUFACTURERS ARE DESIGNING. ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS OR THEIR NEXT LIFE AND THAT WE ARE NOT DOING AS I LIKE TO REFER AT THE LACK OF MORAL AND TRYING TO RECYCLE THINGS THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR DISPOSAL. I'M WE AS YOU KNOW HAS FOUR OR FIVE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU JUST DEFINE IT PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP U. P. R. PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE MAKING INCREDIBLE PROGRESS WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING. AS A STATE IS WORKING WITH THOSE MANUFACTURERS IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE AND REALLY DEMANDING THAT THEIR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED. FOR THEIR NEXT LIFE AND THE LIFE AFTER THAT. AN ARM GOING TO TAKE THAT AS AN OPEN INVITATION TO WORK TOGETHER ON THAT SO THAT'S GREAT. IN THE WEEKS. AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION. IS ON ORGANICS WHICH IS BEEN CENTRAL TO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN DOING THERE'S A BILL THAT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED. I KNOW I'M DOING A BILL TO WORK WITH THE CITIES TO NOT RELAXED REQUIREMENTS BUT THEY HAD A ROUGH YEAR COULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR THIS YEAR. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT A PHENOMENAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THIS BUDGET THAT IS HEADED THE GOVERNOR'S WHY. ARE IF YOU HAVE THAT MONEY AND YOU DON'T RELAX REQUIREMENTS WHERE DOES THAT PUT US IN A SORT OF GETTING TO THE DEADLINE AND MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS. WELL I THINK WE'VE LAID SOME REALLY GOOD GROUNDWORK IN THE LAST YEAR AND AS WELL YOUR LAST WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO REALLY HAVE THE TOOLS. MOVING FORWARD SO I'M CYCLE ADOPTED OR I REGULATIONS AND FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND OVER THE LAST YEAR WE HAD AND- BUILDING TOOLS LIKE MODEL ORDINANCES EDUCATIONAL TOOLS PROCUREMENT TOOLS. TO REALLY HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CECILY TAPE THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS. I WE ARE ALSO CONDUCTED HUNDREDS AS AN INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS AS WELL AS AND AS WEBINARS AND- AT LARGER MEETINGS BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS TO REALLY FACILITATE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM ON WHAT THEY NEED TO CUT OR COMPLIANCE AND I THINK THAT MANY THAT THE- LEGISLATURE SPENT PORRIDGE. THAT AND IS A POTENTIAL INFUSION IN HELPING THEM BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FOR THE APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING AND NOT WASTE THERE IT'S A VERY EXCITING TIME I THINK IT REALLY WELL ONCE AND COMPLIANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SERRA. AND WE REALLY SEE OUR ROLE AS HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COME INTO COMPLIANCE AS YOU KNOW THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS A STATE WIDE REQUIREMENT OF 75% TO BRITISCHEN OF ORGANIC WASTE. AND BITE AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND UNFORTUNATELY AND WHILE WE ARE DISPOSING OF MORE THAN OUR BASELINE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT I THINK THE INFUSION OF DOLLARS AND THE TOOLS THAT CAL RECYCLE HAS BUILT AND- IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO VERY QUICKLY. AS MAKE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS RIGHT THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT TO AN END THANK YOU MADAM. CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME. OF THE TIME TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS ARE REALLY. I AS WE- SENATE GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM MISS WAGNER I APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY FOR YESTERDAY MY MEETING JUST BEFORE YOURS WENT- EXTRA LONG AND ALTHOUGH I DID TRY TO GET OUT OF IT I WAS NOT ABLE TO SO I APOLOGIZE- FOR THAT. IT'S DEFINITELY A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU BEFORE ME I JUST APPRECIATE ALL THE TIME THAT YOU WERE VERY HELPFUL AND ALWAYS RESPONSIVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH AND EXCITED THAT YOU'RE TAKING ON THIS ROLE. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AT CURBSIDE RICART CYCLING AND MERSE AND I APOLOGIZE AGAIN FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO SKETCH YESTERDAY. BUT I KNOW THAT THE REGULATORY PROCESS OF THE MANDATES THAT FELL ON PRIVATE BUSINESS INDUSTRY AND RECYCLERS. CREATED A BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN A ROBUST RECYCLING PROGRAM THAT- AS- ADDRESSES CURBSIDE PICKUP AND- TAKING THE NUMBERS TO SEPARATE AND RECYCLE. AND SO I KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF BILLS GOING THROUGH THE BUILDING- AND I KNOW EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN REPRESENTATION OF THEIR OWN DISTRICT AND I RESPECT THAT. BUT I DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THAT SO WAS CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT CURBSIDE PICKUP AND IMMERSE. STOP ME IF I'M GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SENATOR AT MAKE SURE I'M I'M I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY IN TERMS OF. WHERE I'M AT DEPARTMENT AND MY PERSONAL AND AS THE DIRECTOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CURBSIDE PICKUP AND MERCS I THINK. WE HAVE AS YOU STATED INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN AND INFRASTRUCTURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT HAS DISABILITY DISORIENTATED EXCUSE ME PICK UP AND ITS COLLECTION I HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIALLY RECYCLABLE MATERIALS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE HERE WITHOUT INVESTMENT THAT IS SOMETHING BACK CALIFORNIANS EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS WHAT THE BLUE BANUS KNOWS HOW TO USE THE BLUE BAND. I'M THAT BEING SAID I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO OUR SYSTEM AND BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT IS LANDING IN THE LUMEN IS NOT ULTIMATELY ENDING UP BEING RECYCLED. STILL I THINK THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY HERE WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE HAULERS AND RECYCLERS AND ARMORS. TO WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM BUT IT ISN'T IT IS AN INCREDIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE STARTED IN. THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND WAS GROUNDBREAKING WHEN CALIFORNIA STARTED. BUILDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK AND AS OUR MATERIALS HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED AND CONTAMINATION IT'S BECOME. A REAL ISSUE AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO FIX IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT OPPORTUNITY- I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL. ALWAYS BE OPEN TO ALL SIDES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK OUT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN DEALING WITH THIS- AND I CAN SEND YOU A LIST AS WELL AS- IS AND CONVENIENCE AND THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE- WE LEARNED A LOT IN THE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW WE LEARNED ACT. AND PEOPLE WHOSE JOBS WERE NOT DEEMED ESSENTIAL HAD PROBLEMS PROVIDING FOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR. FOUR AMOUNT OF FOOD SO THAT PEOPLE COULD BE WE GET ELIMINATE FOOD INSECURITY PER SE. AND THEN WE LEARNED WITH THE FOOD BANKS THAT EVEN IN BAKERSFIELD IF YOU HAD TO FOOD BANKS IN THE CITY OF BAKERSFIELD. A SINGLE MOM WITH THE STROLLER AND- YOU KNOW TAKING TWO KIDS OR AN ELDERLY WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN OR AT INDIVIDUAL THAT. WAS NOT AT VERY AMBULATORY HOW TO MAKE IT EVEN IN A MILE OR TWO MILES FROM THEIR HOME IN MUCH LESS LOAD UP A FIFTY POUND BOX OF FOOD AND BRING IT BACK. SO I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS REGARDING- BILLS GOING THROUGH THE BUILDING ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER. AND WHAT ABOUT THE SINGLE MOM THAT WOULD NORMALLY THROW THEIR BOTTLES OUT ON THE CURB- OR IN THE BLUE VAN. BE PICKED UP BY A CURBSIDE RECYCLING THAT COMES DOWN EITHER TWICE OR ONCE A WEEK IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD- THE ELDERLY PERSONS NEIGHBORHOOD OR- ANYBODY. I MEAN I MEAN I FEEL LIKE I COULD PROBABLY TAKE IT BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER BUT I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE HUGE INCONVENIENCE TO LOOK AT. YOU KNOW OUR SODA BOTTLES BEER CANS WHATEVER THEY ARE AND TAKEN BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER. AM I JUST ASSUME LEAVING OUT ON THE CURB AND HAVE SOMEBODY PICK THEM UP I'M ALL ABOUT CONVENIENCE. SO MOVING FORWARD I'D LIKE YOU TO YOU KNOW CONSIDER THOSE THINGS CONSIDER THE FACT THAT. THE SINGLE MOM MAY NOT HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO TAKE IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE ROOM THE MANUFACTURER. AND THE- ELDERLY PERSON THAT'S NON AMBULATORY MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO AND MAY I HAVE A CAR- IN THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED IN THE PANDEMIC WERE. YOU KNOW THE FOOD BANKS FOR FABULOUS AND THEY SERVED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE THROGH. BUT THE LAST MILE WAS ALSO NEEDED TO DELIVER THAT- FOOD INTO. THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW MAYBE COULDN'T MAKE IT TO THE FOOD BANKS. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK AT MOVING FORWARD SPECIFICALLY. I DON'T SEE JUST FOR THE CONVENIENCE ISSUE BUT IT'S CONVENIENCE IN MANY WAYS- I NOTICED THAT WHEN- THEY STUTTERED WITH THE TRASH CANS SPECIFICALLY INTO A PLACE AND OIL DEL. WE HAD IS LIKE A TRAILER PARK IN. AND THEY HAVE ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT TRASH BINS BUT PEOPLE WOULD JUST THROW THEIR GARBAGE ALL OVER IN IN THEIR RESPIRE HILLS OF STUFF THAT HAD TO BE PICKED UP. AS A MATTER OF FACT WE REALIZE WHAT WAS GOING ON HE WORKED WITH THE LOCAL AND- GOVERNMENT THERE HE PROVIDED US- YOU KNOW- BACKHOES AND LOADERS TO PICK UP THIS. GARBAGE THAT HAD BEEN COLLECTED FOR MANY MANY AND YOU KNOW MONTHS. AND BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE. AND I ASKED HIM. END THIS IS WHAT GAVE ME A REALITY CHECK IGHT SO I ASKED HIM WHEN I WNT TO GO HELP AND WE BROUGHT IN SINCE DEFINITELY. YOU KNOW PREPARED MEALS AND- YOU KNOW TRY TO TAKE HER THIS VERY POOR AREA OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND I SAID YOU KNOW WHY WOULD YOU LET STUFF PILE UP LIKE THAT IN THE GUIDE COMPLETELY ASLEEP RIGHT NOW RYAN SAID. WOULD YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH IT. IT DOESN'T IN THE BLUE CANDLES FOR THE GREEN CAN. AND I DON'T HAVE A CAR TO TAKE IT TO THEM. AND THAT MADE PERFECT SENSE TO ME. SO AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH ALL THESE THINGS I THINK THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- THAT HAS BEEN. PUT FORWARD AND I'M NOT DEFENDING ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. I MEAN THERE'S JUST A BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF- OF INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT IS A BIT PUT AT THE CREASE A CONVENIENCE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WHETHER YOU. NEED THAT CONVENIENCE OR JUST DESIRE. THAT CONVENIENCE. AND I THINK MOVING FORWARD IT WOULD. BE HUGE IF YOU WOULD AT LEAST CONSIDER THAT. RAMIFICATION IF CERTAIN CHANGES ARE MADE TO THIS PROGRAM. AND THOSE CONVENIENCES WOULD DISAPPEAR FOR. YOU KNOW PEOPLE I GUESS THAT ENJOY THE CONVENIENCE. AND AND IT WOULD ALSO DISAPPEAR FOR PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED THAT CONVENIENCE- IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE THAT PILOT IN THEIR YARD. AS SO I'D LIKE YOUR COMMITMENT IF YOU WOULD AT LEAST LOOK AT THAT. SENATOR AND AS ALWAYS HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND WORK WITH YOU AS WE MAKE. ANY NUMBER OF REFORM SAID THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT AND DEFINITELY WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AND RECYCLING REFORM OVERALL. AND I THINK YOU MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT PEOPLE ONLY RECYCLE AND SO FAR AS THEY ARE. ABLE AND WILLING AND IS BEING ANSWER- THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT AND LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU I DO APPRECIATE THAT. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS IF THAT'S OKAY AND MAYBE NOT AND ALL OF THE ONES THAT I HAVE HERE. AND SO HOW AT THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY MY DISTRICT HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT FINDING ENOUGH RECYCLED PLASTIC- FOR THE- THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS AND THAT ARE NEEDED. I WHAT'S THE STATE DOING TO ENCOURAGE RECYCLERS OF PLASTICS TO MEET THE- UPCOMING MINIMUM CONTENT DEADLINES. AND THIS IS A NEAT A STICKY WICKET SQL SENATOR DRIVE BECAUSE AND THAT'S THURMOND FORMS ARE USING THE SAME PLASTICS THAT INSTEAD OF PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES AND BEVERAGE CONTAINER BOTTLES ARE USING AND NOW THERE IS A DEMAND FOR ACTUALLY A PLASTIC THAT WAS IN MUCH LESSER DEMAND- AND AS IN PAST YEARS. AND SO I THINK IT IN IN IN AS I SAID WAS A STICKY WICKET BECAUSE IT REALLY GETS YOU ON THAT QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE RECYCLE AND HOW WEEKS ALEXIS MATERIALS AND WHETHER OR NOT WE MAKES LESS THAN THEY ARE ULTIMATELY RECYCLABLE AND- AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR CURRENT WEBSITE SYSTEM. I'M RESULT IN A LOT OF THOSE PLASTICS NOT AND NOT ABLE TO BE RECYCLED AND SO YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WITH THIS PLAN IS THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH ARMOR AND THE REST OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GET THOSE PROSPECTS BACK IN A WAY THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT THAT'S RECYCLABLE. AND THEY STERN FORMS I WE GET THEM TO THE PLACE AND THERE WERE I'M SOME OF OUR LARGER PRODUCERS AS WELL AS OUR SMALLER PRODUCERS THAT USE A SERVER FARMS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THOSE PRODUCTS RECYCLED THEMSELVES AND SO. IT IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH OUR PARTNERS IN AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND SPEND RECYCLING INDUSTRY AND WORKS TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE AT AGAIN THAT THAT NEVER ENDING LIFE OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT. AND WE NEED TO GET THERE WITH THAT WITH THE CLAM SHELLS AND SOME OF THESE OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN A WAY THAT WE CAN INCREASE THE. THE AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT WE HAVE. WHY I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MENTION SINCE I'M AT THE-% HERE. I'M SO I HAVE ONE MORE AND LET'S SEE WHERE THAT ONE GOES AND- SO ACT CARRY CYCLE- I JUST CURIOUS OF WHAT WHAT'S YOUR PLANS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO NEED A PLAN MOVING FORWARD AND IT'S GOING TO IT. AT A BE INTERESTED IN IT AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE IT DEVELOPED OR WHAT YOUR THOUGHT PROCESSES BUT YOU CAN AT LEAST GIVE ME AN IDEA WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH IT. THE INTO LIFE PER SE OF- PEAVEY PANELS AND BATTERIES FOR YOU KNOW ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND ENERGY STORAGE- I KNOW IN IN BORON IN MY DISTRICT THERE AT PRODUCING LITHIUM FOR LITHIUM BATTERY SO WE HAVE A LONGER STORES HELP MEET RENEWABLE GOALS. AND WE ALSO HAVE AGAIN I KNOW THIS COMMITTEES PRIOR TO HEARING ABOUT IT EVERYBODY IS LARGE SCALE SOLAR AND NOT JUST ROOF TOP SOLAR BUT LARGE SCALE SOLAR AND- SO AS I MEAN I THINK THE PLANT IT'S GOING IN NOW IS FIVE TIMES THE SIZE OF DISNEYLAND. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE NEED TO BUT WHERE DO THESE THINGS GO AFTER THEIR LIFE IS AND EXHAUSTED HEARING WE'VE USED IT FOR. RENEWABLE ENERGY I. MEAN WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THAT. SENATE AND IS. SEXY QUESTION WE ARE PART OF AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE ON BOTH BATTERIES AND TV PANELS BECAUSE THAT IS A HUGE QUESTIONS WE KNOW. THESE AREN'T SIMPLY PIECES OF PLASTIC THESE ARE VERY COMPLICATED. AND MATERIALS WITH INTEGRATED AND METALS CENTER AND I'M THAT HAVE HOPEFULLY ADDITIONAL LIFE TO GIVE AND BUT IF THEY'RE RECYCLING PROCESS WILL BE. VERY VERY COMPLICATED AND IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU BRING UP THIS EXAMPLE BECAUSE- I HAVE MY VERY FIRST THOUGHTS AROUND A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. HE MET BECAUSE I'M SENATOR MONEY AUTHORED A BILL ON THIS SUBJECT MANY YEARS AGO. I'M SPECIFICALLY SAYING WE'RE PUTTING ALL THESE TV PANELS OUT IN THE WORLD WHAT ARE WE GOING TO. DO WITH THAT HE SAID THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION SENATOR WE SHOULD BE DSIGNING OUR PRODUCTS. DO YOU HAVE A SECOND LIFE TEN AND NEVER ENDING LIKE WE SHOULD BE DESIGNING IT WHICH I UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR PRODUCTS ARE GOING AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE. AND WHAT THEIR NEXT LIFE LOOKS LIKE. I'M AS WE ARE DESIGNING ON NOT AT THE BACK AND WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND SERVE. THIS IS A HUGE QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS MANY OF OUR PREMIUM CHANNELS ARE COMING TO THE END OF THEIR LIFE. I'M THEIR FIRST LIFE. AND THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY ON- ON THIS BIG HUGE QUESTIONS SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE SPENT MANY. OKAY TO COME UP WITH AN ANSWER BUT I THINK THE LITHIUM I BATTERY IS THE NEXT. THE NEXT VERSION OF THAT AND SO WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH ARE. MANUFACTURERS ON LOOKING AT THIS AND BEFORE THEY BUT THOSE BATTERIES OUTLINES CARS NOW ON THE ROAD. AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO. I THINK YOU AND SOME OF THIS IS MY FEAR SO MY FEAR IS THAT. AS WE GO FORWARD FOR GREEN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY. AND AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT REALLY AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT OR JUST ABOUT. AND INNOVATION IS HAPPENING SPECIFICALLY IN MY DISTRICT LITHIUM BATTERIES I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN MINING IN BORON FOR. DECADES RIGHT AND THE AND NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT USING THE BY PRODUCT WITH HIM UNTIL THIS CAME UP AND NOW THEY'VE- INVESTED YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN A RESEARCH FACILITY THAT PROVIDES LITHIUM BATTERIES TO ALLOW YOU GUYS TO DO STORAGE AND- YOU KNOW CREATE. AND MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. EV BUT THERE'S NOT A PATH TO WHERE THESE BATTERIES GOING TO GO- THE SAME WITH THE SOLAR PANELS- MY FURIOUS AND- THAT FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT. ARE WARRANTED BECAUSE OF OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON CURRENTLY IN THE STATE WITH THEM. MY DISTRICT PRODUCING THIS POWER IS THAT. IT JUST LIKE THIS BILL WILL GO BACK TO THE PRODUCER RIGHT BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER WELL- I DON'T THINK THAT'S A LITTLE FAIR I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT. I MEAN IS THERE A PUT IT DO YOU THINK THAT IT WOULD JUST BE PUSHED BACK TOOK ARMS AND SAY IT IS GONNA BE PUSHED BACK TO KERN COUNTY IN OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF IT. AND WITH NO HAVE YOU KNOW. NO PLAN FROM THE STATE. OTHER THAN TO MANDATE IS TO TAKE CARE OF IT. WELL SENATOR I EIGHT EIGHT AND I'M NOT GOING TO SEE YOU- FORECAST WHAT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF HOW THE STATE IS GOING TO HANDLE THIS. BUT LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST DECADE WE'VE LOOKED AT THESE COMPLICATED ISSUES IN THIS COMPLICATED MATERIALS AND HAD BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE MANUFACTURERS AS I'M A LECTURE CRITICAL BATTERIES AND AS SOME OF THE YOU KNOW THAT LARGE BANERJEE BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE MANUFACTURERS. AND ASKED THEM THIS QUESTION ASK THEM AS THEY WERE DESIGNING THEIR PRODUCTS HOW THEY INTEND TO REALLY EITHER EXTEND THE LIFE OR DEAL WITH. WITH THE END OF LIFE AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY MUCH AT THE TABLE AND PART OF THAT CONVERSATION SO. MY GRANT HIM IS THAT HE THAT I THAT NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE AT THE END OF LIFE AND RASPING WE HAVE A HAS. A STACK OF CRTS I ALWAYS USE THIS YEAR TO USE AS MY EXAMPLE SO THAT THE TELEVISIONS THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO. WHERE TO SEND THEM I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND- YOU KNOW I THINK WE LEARNED OUR LESSONS FROM. FROM THE E. WASTE THAT SITUATION AND WE LEARNED OUR LESSON FROM THE EXCITED SITUATION AS A STATE WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD IN MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE WORKING REALLY HARD. TO NOT END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE WE WHERE WE HAVE HAVE. A LITERAL STOCKPILE OF WASTE AND ACTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING ALL MY QUESTIONS AGAIN I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MEETING YESTERDAY. I LOOKS FORWARD AND TO YOU ASSUMING THIS POSITION AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO AND WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE ON THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY. BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTION THAT KERN IS GOING ON RENEWABLES THANK YOU MA'AM. YOU AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR AND I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE WHAT A CRAZY SCHEDULE YOU ALL HAD THE SPEAKS OF THANK YOU. FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR TIMES. THANK YOU. KERR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WAGNER IT IS VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME YESTERDAY OR MONDAY I CAN'T EVEN I NEVER REMEMBER THE DAYS- TO TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR ROLE AND CAL RECYCLED. YOU KNOW I'M JUST GONNA SAY- RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK YOU ARE IMMENSELY. QUALIFIED FOR THIS JOB- YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE IS VERY DEEP ON THE ISSUES- THAT FALL UNDER CAL RECYCLE. AND AS YOU HAVE- SHARED IN YOUR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS ASKED BY MINUTE MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE DIESS. CALORIE CYCLE DOES A LOT- IT IS A COMBINATION OF SORT OF THE FUNCTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION. OF PRACTICES AND POLICIES- I THINK THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP PROTECT. AND HEAL THE EARTH AND ENCOURAGE GREATER PARTICIPATION FROM CALIFORNIANS IN THAT. AND THEN IT'S EDUCATION- TO YOUR PARTNERS- CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS BEING INDIVIDUALS BEING CITIES OTHER JURISDICTIONS. ABOUT WHAT YOU GET FOR WHAT YOU DO AND THE WHAT YOU DO IS THE RECYCLING OF THE COMPOSTING- BY THE REUSING AND HOPEFULLY WHAT YOU GET- IS CLEANER LAND CLEANER AIR CLEANER WATER. ETCETERA BOTH OF THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE WORK INVOLVES CUSTOMER SERVICE- AND HOW YOU'RE RESPONDING TO THE CUSTOMER'S I'M IN SO I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS- UP IN OUR DISCUSSION ON MONDAY SO IT WOULD BE GREAT. JUST TO KIND OF- SHARE SOME OF THOSE RESPONSES AGAIN. THERE WAS AN ARTICLE WHICH I SHARED WITH YOU- FROM THE SERIOUS CAREER REALLY ABOUT- A VERY SMALL CITY I'M TRYING TO WORK THROUGH I THINK THE CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTATION WITHIN AN ORGANICS PROGRAM- AND PROBABLY LOOKING TO CAL RECYCLE AS A PARTNER- AND- ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE IN SOME OF THE FOLKS YOU KNOW FELT KIND OF UNDERMINED. BY THE DEPARTMENT AND FIGURED AND SEEMED IT SEEMED AS IF THE DEPARTMENT WAS WORKING AGAINST THEM RATHER THAN TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM- AND MANY OF THESE POLICIES I'M SURE CAN BE OVERWHELMING ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL CITIES OR CITIES THAT DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY AREAMPLY RESOURCE- TO. ADDRESS YOU KNOW RECYCLING MARKETS NEW PROGRAMS LIKE CETERA. AND THEN OF COURSE I SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW- THAT EVEN MY OFFICES HAD WITH GETTING SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM- CAL RECYCLE SO JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO YOUR PLAN- AS ITS NEW LEADER- ON HOW YOU LEAD A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO CUSTOMER SERVICE- BECAUSE AS YOU HAVE SHARED IN. WITH ME LISTENING TO YOU- IT'S THIS IS VERY EXTENSIVE WORK ARM IN THERE A LOT OF PARTICULARS- AND FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON IN PROBABLY ONCE AGAIN FOR THE SMALL CITY- THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE SUCCESSFUL DATA TO REPORT OUT. WE SENATOR I SO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ON MONDAY AND SOMETHING THAT I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO AND AGAIN COMING FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND AS AS AS AS A STAFFER I REALLY DO LOOK AND AT AND HOW WE SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS TRULY THROUGH THE LEGISLATUREAND THROUGH CONSTITUENTS AND THAT IS OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL OR OTHERWISE AND INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUENTS AND HOW DO WE SERVE. AND THROUGH EDUCATION AND SERVICES SO THAT WE ARE ALL SUCCESSFUL AND SERRA AND IT IT HAS AND YOU KNOW YOU IN DALLAS HOUSING I DID CHECK INTO THE SITUATION INCINERATES JUST TO LET YOU KNOW AND IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE MISCOMMUNICATION OF WHERE OUR STAFF WAS TRYING. TO BE EXTRA COMMUNICATIVE. IT'S AND UP IN A MISSED ME. I'M THAT SENSE BEEN REMEDY THANK. AND BUT IT REALLY AS YOU POINTED OUT IS SOMETHING THAT OUR DEPARTMENT REALLY CAN CAN WORK ON IT THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO WORK ON IS OUR COMMUNICATION TOOLS HOW WE MEET WITH THE LEGISLATURE HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH AT WITH OUR- CONSTITUENTS AND OUR OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND- AND I HAVE A TOP NOTCH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR WHO IS. WORKING ON AN EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW WHO IS WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS ON HOW WE COMMUNICATE AND- IS REALLY BECOMING MORE AND OUR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE OR OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS. IS BECOMING MORE INTEGRAL TO WORKING WITH OUR OUR EACH OF OUR PROGRAMS AND ON HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- EIGHT YEAR. HI I CAN HAVE ALL OF THE KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORLD AND ABOUT HOW TO DO SOMETHING BUT IF I CAN'T COMMUNICATE AND I'M NOT GOING TO SUCCESSFULLY. GET HI YEAH- ANYBODY THERE SO I'M IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE WORKING ON AND INTERNALLY EXTERNALLY AND AS THIS DEPARTMENT. CONTINUES TO GROW AND EVOLVE AND THE KIND OF REALLY AND A LARGER SIZED APARTMENT IT IS A GROWING PAIN THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING AND- AGAIN I LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR AND FOR THE FOLLOW UP- YOU TALKED IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENTS ABOUT- THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND I THINK YOU REFERENCED IT IN SOME OF THE RESPONSES YOU GAVE TO-SOME QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP IN. WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT ESPECIALLY IN RELATIONSHIP TO DISTRICTS LIKE MINE URBAN OUT POOR- AND DIVERSE- YOU KNOW WE- AND I'M SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SOUTHERN PART OF MY DISTRICT. I LIKE TO SAY WE DO A LOT OF RECYCLING YOU KNOW POOR FOLKS WERE IN THE RECYCLING GAME LONG BEFORE IT WAS- YOU KNOW TRENDY- AND YOU ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT YOURSELF WITH- THEIR RECENT THE RE USE OF TEXTILES. SO WE ARE YOU KNOW COLLECTING CANS WE ARE RECYCLING- BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS AROUND. GREEN INVESTMENT IN GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. THOSE DOLLARS AND THOSE COMMITMENTS GO TO OTHER PLACES AND MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OPEN SPACE SEARCHING FOR LAND I DON'T KNOW WHY MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE FOLKS DON'T WANT TO. PUT THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT IN AN URBAN CENTER. BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO CREATE BUY IN FROM PEOPLE WHEN YOU OVERLOOK THEM- WHEN YOU'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS AROUND INVESTMENT. AND SO. SINCE WE DO HAVE SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY SINCE WE ALSO DO HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT IT SEEMS LIKE IT MAKES SENSE TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CONVERGE- OF THOSE TWO ISSUES. AT AND CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO AB SUSPEND SUSTAINABLE. BUT ALSO BE- YOU KNOW ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS SO. YEAH I'D- LIKE TO GET YOU KNOW A I'D LOVE TO GET A COMMITMENT FROM YOU TO COMMON TORE MY DISTRICT WITH ME- I HAVE SO MANY IDEAS ABOUT ORGANICS AND COMPOSTING INSIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES YOU AND I TALKED A LOT ABOUT. SORT OF TEXTILES AND HOW WE CAN PLAY IN A DEEPER RLE IN THAT YOU KNOW I'M ACTUALLY A FAN OF- STOPPING ALL PRODUCTION FOR A MINUTE SO THAT WE CAN CURB OUR WASTE IN OUR CONSUMPTION. I KNOW THAT'S KIND OF HEAVY FOR SOME. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO GET A COMMITMENT FOR ME TO COME TO THE DISTRICT AND ALSO WOULD LOVE TO GET SOME KIND OF COMMITMENT FROM SOMEONE ABOUT. YOU KNOW REMINDING FOLKS ABOUT SOUTH LA AND PLACES ACROSS THE STATE LIKE SOUTH LA THAT DESERVE YOU KNOW- THIS KIND OF. INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE THERE THE JOBS ARE THERE THE WILL IS THERE. BUT NO ONE ACTUALLY SEEMS TO CONSIDER THEM. AND A CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS AS IS AS MUCH ABOUT. FROM A TANAMI. YOU KNOW IN THE CREATION OF CAREERS AND JOBS- AND EMANCIPATION FROM CERTAIN SYSTEMS AND LESS ABOUT CHARITY- AND IT ALSO MOVES US FORWARD WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAL AND PROTECT MOTHER EARTH SO CAN YOU LITTLE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW MAYBE THERE CAN BE A SHIFT- IN- PERCEPTION ABOUT PLACES LIKE SOUTH LA AND OUR ROLE IN THIS- CIRCULAR ECONOMY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION CENTER AND FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD LOVE TO COME IN FOR YOUR DISTRICT I THINK THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC AND- AND WOULD LIKE TO BRING A TEAM OF PEOPLE DOWN TO SORRY YOUR DISTRICT AND BECAUSE YOU ARE HITTING ON A POINT THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART- I SPENT A LOT OF TIME. WELL AND WORKING AND FOR THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE OUT WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU KNOW WITH HI ON I'M- THE ECCENTRICITY- AND VERNON. AND SPENDING A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THAT FACILITY AND WHAT IT. HAS DONE TO THAT COMMUNITY AND THAT. SORT OF THE DICHOTOMY OF ITS HISTORY RIGHT BECAUSE IT PROVIDED. A CAREER PATH AND SOME REALLY GOOD JOBS TO PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME- SALUTING THEIR ERROR AND THEY'RE WATER AND- AND REALLY- DOES READING THAT COMMUNITY AND SO. I'M I SPENT ON MANAGEMENT FOR THE LAST DECADE THINKING ABOUT WILL. BE INVESTING IN COMPANIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T DO THAT. THAT BRING THE GOOD JOBS. AND BRING CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND LONGEVITY. AND DO IT IN A WAY- THAT REALLY ADDS FUELS THAT COMMUNITY AND ISN'T THAT WHERE WHEN YOU. HAVE STATE PROGRAMS AND INVEST IN BUSINESS ISN'T THAT THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN. AND ADDS THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS INNOCENT MASON CITY. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY VERY SPECIFICALLY TO HAVE THAT. CONVERSATION WHO ARE THE COMPANIES WHO WANT TO INVEST. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THE JOBS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THOSE CAREER PASSED. ON AND THAT ARE GOING TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT AND CREATE NEW PUBLIC HOUSE RESTS. SO THIS IS VERY SPECIFICALLY AGAIN. WHY I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY THIS IS SOMETHING VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO THE GOVERNOR'S ART THIS IS SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT. AND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AS BUILDING THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND WHY WE'RE DOING IT AND THIS IS- VERY PURPOSEFULLY WHY WE'RE DOING IT HOW DO WE INVEST. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT. ARE ECONOMICALLY UNDERSERVED AND BUILD SOMETHING. AND WHAT I THINK WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU THAT- AND THE ARE THANK YOU VERY EXCITED THIS I CAN TELL BUT I THINK THAT'S WHY IT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE. QUALIFIED FOR THIS POSITION. IT IS NOT RELATED TO CURRENT CYCLE BUT I'LL JUST SURE THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE PAPER EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT TALKED ABOUT WIND TURBINES- AND IT'S A GREAT CAREER OPPORTUNITY FOR ROCK CLIMBERS. FOLKS THAT DON'T REALLY HAVE YOU KNOW COLLEGE DEGREES- BUT THIS SKILL- HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY USEFUL FOR THEM GOING UP AND MAKING REPAIRS AND MAKING SIX FIGURE SALARIES AND BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES. NOW NONE OF THAT IS HAPPENING IN SOUTH LA- AND I THINK AS WE BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS TO USE AND CONSERVE- AND REUSE ENERGY AS WE TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAYS TO REUSE AND RECYCLE. THE MATERIALS THAT WE HAVE- IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN EMPLOY. FOLKS IN WHO WE CAN EMPLOY IN THE SKILLS THE DIFFERENT KIND OF SKILLS THAT THEY MAY HAVE. ON THAT WILL PROVE ADVANTAGEOUS TO US MAKING THE KINDS OF GOALS- THAT I THINK ARE PRESCRIBED UNDER- YOUR MANDATE WITH CAL RECYCLE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGREE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN SENIOR DISTRICT. THANK YOU SENATOR COM LAGER- WELL I HINK AGAIN ALWAYS GO IN LAST- THE QUESTION TO ASK I APPRECIATE SENATOR LARGE QUESTIONS ABOUT- CERTAINLY TIRES AT THE BORDER AND- I REMEMBER HIM VISITING WHEN.

AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO STEP ON- MY PROGRAMS THAT TOES IN ASKING THIS QUESTION BUT WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS- BOTH OF YOUR THOUGHTS- ON DECERTIFICATION- AND- HOW. POST IF THIS IS TO PASS- HOW POSTS RELATIONSHIP- TO MAKING SURE THAT- IT IS IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY- THAT IS TRUE TO THE INTENT AND THE REASON WHY I ASK- IS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW MUCH W. R. CHAIR OF THE HOST- AND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MAYBE NOT EVERYONE ON THE COMMISSION HAS THE SAME THOUGHTS. AROUND THE CERTIFICATION- AND WHAT IT pSTATE AND SHERIFF BRIAN AS SOMEONE WHO IS AN ACTING SHERIFF- WHO HAS TALKED ABOUT QUESTIONS AROUND STANDARDIZATION OF THIS- BUT ALSO SOMEONE WHO WOULD IS ON. WHO IS NOW ON POST- YOU KNOW THESE KINDS OF PERSPECTIVES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY WILL THEY WILL EFFORT THEY WILL GREEN FOR FOLKS.

FOR I WOULD LOVE IF- CHAIR DUDLEY COULD GO FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU- WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FAMILY YES THAT IS VERY MUCH MY PASSION. AND MY- FIRST HUSBAND IS LATINO AND AMERICAN INDIANS AND I HAVE A DARK SKIN CHILD AND MY SECOND HUSBAND WAS ANGLO AND SO I HAVE A WHITISH SKIN CHILD. AND I'VE LEARNED A WHOLE LOT FROM LISTENING TO BOTH OF THEM- BECAUSE I'M THEY TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT TREATMENT THEY'VE RECEIVED AND I HAVE EVERY REASON TO TRUST THAT IN EVERY REASON TO FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. IN TERMS OF NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT HEALTHCARE EDUCATION EVERY OTHER COMPONENT THAT MAKES YOUNG MEN GROW UP TO BE WHO THEY ARE NOT WOMEN. IN TERMS OF THE CERTIFICATION IT'S ME LEGISLATION THAT INTERESTS ME THE MOST RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN WE SAW MISSOURI REALLY MISSPELLED LIKE I ALSO SORRY AND WITH MY APOLOGIES. SENATOR COM LAGER NEEDS TO GO VOTE AND BUDGET HI THIS IS OUR DILEMMA TODAY THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION SO I'M GOING TO PUT A PAUSE ON IT AND WE WILL COME BACK AS SENATOR PLEASE GO VOTE- I YEAH I DID THIS IS THIS IS THE MOST UNLIKELY MEETING WE HAVE NOT HAD THIS YET OCCUR THIS YEAR. BUT IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO PIVOT AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE BOTH- IT YOU WILL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY I'M SURE YOU ARE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE ART OF PIVOTING. SO I'M I'M GONNA PIVOT TO OUR VICE CHAIR AND ASK IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS OR MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND THEN- I'M SURE WE WILL COME BACK TO SENATOR COM LONGER AND YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO START OVER. MISTER LIKE. WE NOTE BUT OKAY. PHOTO MY THE GOOD SENATOR LA WITH TALKING ABOUT THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS AND IT'S PROBABLY ON ALL OF OUR MINDS AND FOOD IS LIKE A PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS YOU WELL KNOW GOING- GOING THROUGH OUR OUR PROCESS HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE- AS WE SPEAK SEVEN FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY TO BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE BOTH OF YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE CAREERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HAVE CERTAINLY- DONE DONE THE JOB HI AT EVERY LEVEL THAT SHE'D BEEN PERFORMING OUT IN ITS GREAT TALK. TO SEE I ASKED WE LIKE TO SAY WOMEN WHO ARE IN THOSE VERY VERY HIGH POSITIONS WITHIN THE FIXED REALLY IMPORTANT PROFESSION CAN TO SHARE OF BRAWN I AM SURE THAT YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH BOB THE SHERIFF OF ORANGE COUNTY OUR FOUNDER HUTCHINSON WHO SERVED IN LOS ANGELES AND SEEM TO HAVE A SIMILAR CAREER TO YOUR STYLE WITH RETIRING AND THEN COMING BACK TO BE THE SHARE FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND I WAS VERY EXCITED TO. BE ONE OF THE BOTH THAT PUT IN THE PLACE AND OF COURSE SHE'S PASSED ON AND THAT WAS A MOMENT OF GREAT SADNESS BUT AGAIN ON ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE SEEN FOR MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OUT THROUGH YOUR CAREER I THINK ARE SO WELL PLACED THAT AS WE ENTER THIS NEW- I GUESS I'D SAY THAT THIS NEW- NOT A RENO THAT CERTAINLY THE NEW WAY THAT WE VIEW LAW ENFORCEMENT AND. ITS RELATIONSHIP TO OUR COMMUNITY. FORTUNE SO I LIKE TO ASK AND A OF YOU. IN YOUR INTERVIEW- PER ISSUE OVER. TO QUESTIONS FROM OUR RULE STAFF. THAT YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS IN IT FROM. THE MANNER IN WHICH IS GOING TO BE LOGGED. IN IMPLEMENTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE. CERTAINLY SOME STANDARDS. THAT FOLLOW SO JUST SHARE WITH ME SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT AS WE GET CLOSER TO THAT BECOMING PERHAPS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY- ANDAL STANDARDS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION AND I THINK BOTH OF YOU MENTIONED. ARE PROCESS ITSELF BECAUSE PROCESS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF. HAVING SOMETHING WORK CORRECTLY FAIRLY AND CONSISTENTLY AS WE INTERVIEW. THOSE WHO MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION- ENOUGH ANYWHERE AWFUL ON KIND OF AN OPEN ENDED QUESTION THAT. ARE YOU COULD START OFF FIRST OF CHAIR DEADLY IF YOU WILL AND THEN I'LL GO. TO OUR SHARE OF PRIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU FOR APPRECIATING OUR SERVICE AND I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR- IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THAT'S YET TO BE DETERMINED AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE RATHER SPECIFIC BECAUSE- SURE RON HAS RESPONSIBILITY. FOR HER DEPARTMENT IN HER JURISDICTION. THE FORTY CERTIFICATION AS YOU WALMART POST HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY IN THE DECERTIFICATION BECAUSE THAT WASN'T THE CERTIFICATION HOST ROLES VERY SPECIFIC AND VERY CLEAR TRAINING. FOLLOW UP TRAINING INFORMATION IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT. AND THEN BEYOND THAT IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL SHARE THE INDIVIDUAL THINGS CHEAP TO TURN AROUND A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. CONTACT DURING THE DAY IF THEY GET FIRED IF THEY IF WHAT HAPPENS THE NEW DESTINATION. SO WE SUDDENLY ASKING POSED TO DO SOMETHING IT HASN'T DONE BEFORE BUT I PERSONALLY FEEL IS WELL EQUIPPED TO DO IT ALL WILL BE WELL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH ONCE WE GET THE RESOURCE. WE'RE ASKING POST YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOMEONE. AND THIS SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE DETERMINED BY HOW THE LAW ITSELF WOULD BE GREAT. IS IT GOING TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS AN INVESTIGATION THAT WAS DONE BY THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY COULD IT BE SOMETHING DONE BY SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO BE DONE BY POSTED THE VERY FIRST QUESTION. WHO'S GOING TO DO THAT INITIAL INVESTIGATION I KNOW THE LAW HAS GONE THROUGH SOME TRANSITIONS I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IT SHOULD BE RATHER SPECIFIC AS TO THAT. AND THEN WHAT DOES POST DO WITH THAT INFORMATION ASSUMING THEY DID NOT CONDUCT IT. HOW MUCH OF THAT TO THE BEGINNING YEAH HOW MANY REVIEWS THEY DO WHAT'S OF TURNING FACTOR WHAT'S THE STANDARD GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT IT'S GOING TO BE PREPONDERANCE IS IT GOING TO BE. THIS PERSON HE WAS SUSTAINED THEREFORE THAT'S A NOT SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HIT MANY MEETINGS OF PROFESSIONALS THROUGHOUT OUR CAREERS IN ORDER TO ADD OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES TOGETHER TO DISCUSS WHAT SYSTEM LOOK LIKE. AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR TO DETERMINE SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE ROLE IS GOING TO BE CLOSE. BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THE IMPORTANCE SINCE I STARTED TO SAY I THINK THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT ALL OF YOUR BASIC- BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN DETERMINING WHAT IS A PROBLEM LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. AND I THINK FOR ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS- WHY NO WATCH CHAU BEEN COMMITTED MURDER. IT WAS A DEGRADATION THE OF THE UNITS. AND IT'S HAD RIPPLE EFFECT IN TERMS MORALE TRIPS EVERY ENTRANCE OF RETAIL. ONE FOUR SEVEN I'M CLOSE TO WOULD BE POUD TO HAVE DE SER PROCESS- MANY FEEL WEIRD DOWN TO THE BAD APPLES CERTAINLY NEED SYSTEMIC EDUCATION BUT THERE ARE SOME BAD APPLES AND I VERY MUCH WANT TO SEE THOSE BAD APPLES GET OUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NOT BE ABLE TO FIND A JOB IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. ANYWHERE ELSE. THANK YOU. ENTERPRISE THANK YOU SENATOR BATES THANK YOU FOR NOT LOOKING AT SURPRISED SHE AND I ONLY OVERLAPPED- BECAUSE THE NETWORK NEEDS SO CRYING AND IT SETS A GREAT EXAMPLE I WOULD LOVE TO LIVE ACTIVE YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING FOR I THINK IT'S A GREAT LOSS IT'S NOT HALF. IN. THE MARKET FOR. CHECK OUT ONTO A- THEY SAY AND I AGREE ACCURATE THAT SHE SAID THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE PROCESS. AND PART OF THAT PROCESS IS DOES THE- SO WHEN I AM LOOKING TO TERMINATE A DEPUTY. WE DO THE INVESTIGATION OR ITS- ACTUALLY THE TERMINATION I WILL HIRE AN OUTSIDE FIRM BECAUSE I'M VERY SMALL TO KEEP MILLION PT WHICH IS TEN THOUSAND SPARK. HERE JUST. IF I WERE FULLY STAFFED TWENTY SETS ONE INCLUDING SO WE ARE TOO SMALL TO DO TO BE INVESTIGATIONS OURSELVES BECAUSE WE'RE TOO CLOSE TO IT. SO I'LL HIRE AN OUTSIDE FIRM TO DO IT. SO DOES THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE INVESTIGATION THE STATE AND I DECIDE TO TERMINATE. SOMEONE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE CERTIFIED THAT. IS POSTER REINVESTIGATION THEIR SECOND. LIKE AN ARBITRATION OF A LOCAL EIGHT WE NEED VERIFICATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE STANDARDS IS STILL. WHAT NEED TO DECIDE. NOT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT FIRED FOR MONEY YOU MIGHT NOT GET YOU FIRED FROM ANOTHER. WHAT QUESTIONS THAT ARE UNANSWERED WILL BE CLEAR. MAKE SURE THAT WORKS BUT I THIS KNOW THAT STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION THAT BY CONCEPT IF YOU START HOW IS ONE VERY STATE DOESN'T HAVE SIR PROCESS AND WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE THAT IN A COMMUNITY EIGHT. SEE THAT WE ARE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WE'RE DOING SO AT THE BUZZWORD WAITRESS. SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND SEE IF YOUR CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE IT'S BEEN ABOUT YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND SEE IF YOU'RE DOCTORS LAST AND THAT AND THAT SEEMS. REALLY UNFAIR. SO DO SUPPORT. DECERTIFICATION I JUST S. TERRIBLY EXACTLY ONCE WE GOT RIGHT WANT TO BE FOR. SHE DOES ONE PERSON OFFICERS. AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. QUESTION IS SOMETHING IF DOING YOUR JOB. THIS IS NICK FAIR. YOU CAN IT- GOING HEAD OF YOU IT'S JUST THE NATURAL PROGRESSION IF YOU'RE UNDER DOING YOUR TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY THE BEST YOUR TAX THE OFFICE TO YOU WERE ARE VERY SLIM. IT'S A GOING TO BE OUT AND MAKE. THOSE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD BE A LONG. I THINK ONE OF THE- CONCERNS CAME UP IN DISCUSS NOW WINDED WAS BE PRESENT ON THE FLOOR AND PERHAPS IN THE FACE COMMITTEE OF WHICH I'M NOT A MEMBER WITHOUT WHATEVER BODY IS CREATED ACTUALLY YOU KNOW REVIEW THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION. THAT THEY BELIEVE THE TELEPHONE YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ESPECIALLY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER A RANK AND FILE OFFICER WOULD ALSO BE A MEMBER OF THE BODY AND FELT THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT PERSPECTIVE OBVIOUSLY YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE THAT WITHIN YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION. THAT SPECIFICALLY TO YOU SHARE BROAD WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT AND SEE IF BOB THAT SEEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ENOUGH MUCH OF THOSE WHO. HAVE A GREAT TIME. YOUR LACK OF CALM AND CREDIBILITY. CREDIBILITY OF A PARTICULAR AGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THAT THAT MIGHT BE A BIASED VIEW THAT IT SEEMS WE'RE SEEKING BALAFON EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO HAVE. I DON'T FIND APPEARING HERE ASPECT TO BE OBJECTIONABLE I. OUR PEERS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HARD ON EACH OTHER. IN CASES WHERE I NEEDED OUT DISCIPLINE AND THE STAFF HAS COME BACK IT SHOULD BE MORE- YEAH AND THEY DON'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS THE CASES AND SHOOT WHY NOT DECISIONS THAT I MAKE- BUT- HERE YOU ASPECT I KNOW TAT THE UP WALKING. THEY HAVE VERY GRAPHIC AT LEAST RESOURCE REPORTS WE HAVE. LINE LEVEL OFFICERS ON THE POST YOU SHOULD BETTER RECENT BECAUSE EVERYONE'S OUT THERE IF YOU NEED A JOB. NO I DON'T WELL ACTUALLY DEAL BECAUSE I WERE INFORMED MAKE TRAFFIC STOPS IN THE SMALL COUNTY BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY GO OUT AND ANSWER CALLS AND DO THE JOB RIGHT ANSWER YOU. KNOW THE MAKE DECISIONS. SO IT SHOULD BE SOME WHO HAS IT. A WORKING LEVEL CURRENT UNDERSTAND OF WHAT THE I DON'T FIND THAT IT'S- WELL THANK YOU FOR YOU RESPONSE FROM I INTEND TO SPUR BOTH OF YOU ARE STRONG. I THINK YOU READ FONG QUALIFY SIGNIFICAN FOR ALL OF THIS YEAR AND GOING TO BE A WANTED TWO WE GET THROUGH I THINK OF THE CURRENT TRAVEL LACK OF TRUST OF WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS SO FAR I HAVE A NUMBER OF FAMILY MEMBERS OVER THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO I KNOW- THE STRESSES THAT PUTS ON THE FAMILY I KNOW HOW FOR A MOMENT- OF EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS DATE WEEKS AND THEN FIGHT IT TENDS TO CHANGE- THE WAY THEY LOOK AT THINGS AND THEY HAVE TO THEY NEED THOSE SOBRE EITHER SIDE TO GET BACK. WITH A BETTER PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE COMING BACK TO YOUR FAMILY SO YOU'RE ALWAYS IN THE SIEGE MENTALITY I THINK IS WHAT. WOULD HAPPEN SINCE SO- PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SOLVE VERY IMPORTANT DENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SHOULD ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE AND I KNOW ALL OF THIS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AS YOU'RE LOOKING OUT. CREATING THE PROCESS AND- IMPACTING SOMEBODY'S LIFETIME CAREER WHERE THEY MAKE SOME SERIOUS HORRIBLE MISTAKES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHO KNOWS WHY AND I THINK THE WHY OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT YEAH AS WE GO FORWARD TO DETERMINING WHO'S FAT- TO CONTINUE TO SERVE. ARE NOT BE TO CERTAIN THE CERTIFIED BUT BUT MAYBE GIVEN THAT SECOND CHANCE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE WITH BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED THE WITHOUT- I WILL- AGAIN GIVE YOU HIGH FIVES BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU ARE TO THE GOVERNOR FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT- YOU SEEM SO VERY WELL QUALIFIED AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU AT THE. APPROPRIATE MOMENT THANK YOU. HE SAID. THANK YOU ARE MAN OF HERE- I WILL JUST SAY. THEY GAVE. PRETTY GREAT ANSWERS ON THE- THESE. HOWEVER IT WAS- MINIMIZED TEARS. MAJOR QUESTION. SO I THEY MAY HAVE TO REPEAT SOME OF THAT- BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT HEADS UP. AND AGAIN WITH MY APOLOGIES TO THE COMMISSIONERS BUT- MY GO TO- SENATOR GROW FIRST AND WE'LL SEE WHAT SHE HAS TO ADD AND- GO FROM THERE. THANKS THANK YOU I'M M. MATTER PRO TEMP. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR THE APPOINTMENT APPOINTMENT OF THEM. TO VERY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. I HAVE TO SAY THAT- SHERIFF BRIAN- MY SHIRTS ARE DONNY YOUNGBLOOD IN MIKE BOUDREAU. AT AND MEET MY DISTRICT AND- I SENT THEM A TEXT AND SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK. AND THEY SAID YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL AND DAT- YOU ARE VERY FAIR AND BALANCED AND YOU WERE VERY GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO AND THEY SUPPORT YOU. AND. AND ONE EVEN SAID SHE LOVES ME. AT YOU CAN GUESS WHICH ONE THAT IS AT. I'M PRETTY SURE I'M- OKAY GREAT ARE THERE AND THAT'S THAT'S HIGH PRAISE FROM BOTH OF THEM IT'S POLITICALLY WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE SO THAT'S THAT. YOU KNOW THEY MADE THAT COMMENT AS WELL POLITICALLY I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE BUT AT YOU ARE AN OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL SO- THAT SPOKE VOLUMES- FROM BOTH OF THE GENTLEMEN THAT BENNETT THAT REPRESENT- MY COMMUNITIES. SO BOTH OF YOU I MEAN BEING ASSIGNED TO THE POST AT. I GUESS A POST THE TRAINING PROGRAM- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE QUESTIONS ON- AND I HOPE I DON'T DUPLICATE ANY QUESTIONS I APOLOGIZE I'VE WE'VE BEEN BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH AND I KNOW THE SENATE PRO TEM GABY THE REASON WE RAN OUT OF THAT THE COMMITTEE HEARING. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AT ABOUT- SHOULD PEACE OFFICERS BE LICENSED BY THE STATE IN A T. AND IF SO DO YOU THINK THAT- POST IS THE RIGHT ENTITY TO PROVIDE THAT LICENSE. AND I CAN DIRECT THAT TO ON A GERMAN DEADLY FIRST- TREMENDOUSLY AND THEN AM SURE PRIME. I THINK YOU'RE A NEAT MA'AM. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I'D LIKE TO ADD MY POSSUM OR SPEED SHARE BROWN AS WELL. RIGHT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY LICENSED BY THE STATE COULD YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS OR A LICENSING PROCESS THAT COULD. GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM. AND IF SO I GUESS MY KEEP MY CURIOUS QUESTION IS THAT. I KNOW YOU'D BE BOUND BY THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WITH BOTH OF YOUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU BOTH HAVE. DO YOU THINK THAT. THE POST ORGANISER THE POST FACILITY OR ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE THE LICENSING. AGENCY AND THE DECERTIFICATION AGENCY. OR SHOULD IT RESIDE IN A- DIFFERENT AGENCY I GUESS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU CHIP- POST COULD HANDLE THIS SHOULD HAMPERS OR AGENCY. I THINK IT SHOULD NOT BE A LOCAL ISSUE I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A STATEWIDE ISSUE I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT I BELIEVE IT HOST THEIR VERY HIGH LEVELS OF EXPECTATION FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ON. AND I THINK THAT SERVING AS A COMMISSIONER I HOPE TO BE REINSTATED THAT IT WOULD BE THE THING I'M MST PASSIONATE ABOUT AND THAT'S MAKING SURE THAT THE PROCESS THERE IS DUE PROCESS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANOTHER AGENCY IN THE STATE THAT WOULD BE BETTER EQUIPPED. THANK YOU MA'AM SHERIFF. I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT- SHOULD BE BECAUSE POSTED THE CERTIFYING AGENCY THEY ISSUE THE BASIC AND ALL THE OTHER CERTIFICATE INTERMEDIATE ADVANCED AND THEY TRACK LL OF THAT INFORMATION IS THAT RIGHT IS THAT WHERE THAT KNOWLEDGE SLICE THOSE STOPS BE AGENCIES TO HANDLE DECERTIFICATION AND IT IT DOES NEED TO BE A STATE AGENCY. AT ONE LOCATION AT THAT LEVEL IT SHOULD NOT BE A LOCAL AGENCY DECERTIFY. THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE LOCAL LEVEL TO TERMINATE RECOMMEND FOR DECERTIFICATION BUT IT NEEDS TO REST WITH THAT WOULD POST A POST I BELIEVE WILDLIFE FIVE ANNIE ALVAREZ YOU CAN BE EASY MARKETS GREAT STAFF IT WILL CREATE AN EXTRA LAYER OF WORKLOAD FOR SURE ESPECIALLY. AT. THE BEGINNING THIS IS SORTED OUT. DETERMINED WHAT ALL THE TO HAPPEN THERE ARE A LOT OF MANY. BURKE SET BACK POST ITS BEST BUT YOU CAN JUST. THERE'S NO OTHER THAT REALLY USE RIGHT NOW MAYBE ENTRAINED GENERAL BUT THAT WOULDN'T REALLY BE EITHER. YEAH CURFEW. IT SEEING IF THEY HAVE ONE COURSE NOT WHO WERE AND I'M THAT WE BE AN AWKWARD POSITION THEM TO BE IN THAT THAT CHARTER CREATING A NEW STATE. HE WAS A LOT YOUR- IT'S PAST EQUIPPED FOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR THAT I DO AN AND EXCUSE ME INNER ON THIS A IT DOES PAY HAVE- RIGHT AND FILE AN OFFICER ASSIST WITH. SO NO POST THAT OVERSIGHT- EIGHT IN FOUR STANDARD IN TRAINING THEY HAVE TO RETIRE. FORCE BEFORE FOR THEM BURKE THANK YOU THEY REALLY ARE IT YOU CANNOT DO OUTDONE ASK IT'S- BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS. SWORN NEVER AT FORCE NETWORK. THANK YOU RIGHT WE THINK YOU SHERIFF AT AGE DRUG DEADLY D. YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A CAR ONE DAY. YOU'RE A MUTE MAN. WE HAVE A SO IS MADE UP OF THE COMMITTEE BUT WE ARE HAVE A THAT GIVES THAT WORKS IN THE FIELD THAT GIVES US FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE FIELD SO THEY REPORT TO THE COMMISSION AND THAT'S JUST A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMISSION- IN TERMS OF WHETHER ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SWARMED GUNS BADGES ALSO WORK AT PROS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SOMEBODY CAN TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE THEIR JOBS AND COME TO PROTEST DURING THE TIME THAT THEY'RE CLOSED I DON'T NEED A WHOLE POST POSITIONS. ARE AT LEAST I HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE THINGS I SUSPECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN I APOLOGIZE IF EITHER DUPLICATE QUESTIONS BUT THEY ARE A HOT SUBJECT MATTERS. AT YOU KNOW WE'RE LIKE DEALING WITH THE STANDARD OF USE OF FORCE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S GUIDELINES WERE ADOPTED EARLIER THIS YEAR AT CAN YOU EITHER ONE TELL ME WHAT- IF BRUCE IS DOING WHAT KIND OUT REACH OR IF THEY ARE DOING OUTREACH TO LOCAL AGENCIES- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GUIDELINES ARE ENCOURAGED OR IS THERE A PROCESS. IN PLACE I'LL START THE DIRECTOR. THANK YOU- CERTAINLY POSES DOING OUTREACH THEY'RE VERY LOTS OF ATHLETES- THEY DID SOMETHING QUITE EXTRAORDINARY EARLY ON. WHEN THE BILL HAD NOT YET PASSED- THEY ASKED ME AND I ASKED TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S LETTER PARKS THE STATE. TO JOIN ME IN DISCUSSING IF THE LEGISLATION PASSED WHAT WOULD IT BE. SO WE GOT TOGETHER VERY EARLY WE MADE A VIDEO THE VIDEO IS STILL AVAILABLE SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE READY TO GO. YOU BEGIN TO TELL PEOPLE THIS IS AREN'T CRASHING ABOUT WHAT THE CHANGE IN THE LAW WOULD BE TWO YEARS. SINCE THEN THEY'VE CREATED CLASSES. PROPERTIES VIDEOS OUT. AND THERE'S BEEN- TREMENDOUS AND ON THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN WELL. AND I THINK THE SHURIKEN SPEAK TO THIS BETTER THERE WAS LOTS OF ANXIETY AROUND THE PASSING THIS LAW AND HOW WOULD THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ABILITY. TO DO THEIR JOB- SO THEREFORE THE INTEREST IS THERE I KNOW LONG BEFORE GOES WAS INVOLVED THIS DISTRICT ATTORNEY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES LOOK WITH RESPECT IF THIS PASSES ARE YOU GOING TO CHANGE. THE WAY YOU EXAMINE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS USE OF FORCE. AND SO EARLY ON WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A TOPIC THAT REQUIRED A LOT OF OUTREACH AND I THINK BECAUSE IT'S- BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT. AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT EFFORT. BUT IT. THAT YES CLOSE THE- EVERY THAT THEIR SCHOOL TO DO HIM MORE. IT IS THIS AGREEMENT THEY OUT TRAINING WILL LEAD STATE THAT THE TRAINING VIDEO THEY'VE INSURED THE BASIC ECONOMY CORPORATION IT CHANGES.

I KNOW YOU'RE ALSO A PROSECUTOR SO YEAH. THANK YOU SENATOR I HAVE TO MAKE THE TOUGH DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO FILE HOMICIDE CASES AT ALL OUR WEATHER TEAM SPORTS YEAH HEY HOW WAS THAT CASE WOULDN'T SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE CASE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED DURING RIGHT NOW GETTING TO THIRTY TWO YEARS IS EVALUATING CASE.

WHAT I HAVE TO LOOK AT IS THE WALK IN THE STANDS THE STANDARDS CHANGED WITH THE NEW- USE OF FORCE LOCK AND IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING I WOULD CONSIDER WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO FILE ON THE SITE CHARGES AGAINST. WHICH POPS. OKAY WANT TO GIVE ME HOPE- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE DISCUSSED OUR IN OUR- CONVERSATION WITH ONE ANOTHER IS TRAINING AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS ASKING FOR OPPOSED TO DO MORE TRAINING- AND THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR BOTH OF YOU AND I GUESS I'LL LET- SHERROD BROWN GO FIRST. I THINK SOMETIMES IN THIS IS MY PERSONAL BELIEF THAT TRAINING CAN BECOME UBIQUITOUS WITH KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS TRAINING TOO MUCH AND NOT GETTING TO THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE- AND ARE THERE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN BE ENGAGING POST. AND HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT OFFICERS GET. THE GUIDELINES AND THE SUPPORT- AND GUIDANCE THAT THEY NEED- TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK IN A WAY THAT KEEPS THEM AND THOSE THAT THEY ARE PROTECTING SAFE. SHERIFF. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THERE IS A LOT OF MANDATED TRAINING THAT SEEMS TO BE THE FIX IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WELL THEY WERE TREATED FOR LESS RESPECT WHAT STRAIGHT MAKE SURE THEY MAKE SURE THEY KNOW AND IT'S TRUE THEY SHOULD KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT THERE'S A SATURATION POINT WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW SIR I'M. YEAH AT. I WAS SPEAKING WITH A LITTLE DEEPER YESTERDAY. RESEARCHING AND SORT OF BRAINSTORMING GET OUT OF THE TRAINING MORE EFFECT AND HOW DO YOU. AT WHETHER TRADING IN WORKING HOW DO WE KNOW WORKING AT THERE YEAH IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE AT. ONE OF THE CONCEPTS EACH JUST THAT BASIC BASIC POST AND THAT IT IS ADDED AND MAYBE TWO. OF FOLLOW. UP WORKS FOR ALL THE LOS. AFTER YOU HAD BASIC YOU HAVE A YEAR TO WORK THE FIELDS GO BACK IT YOU OR LONG. SHE TRAINING IT HOW HOW. WHAT TO WHAT YOU DO. HOW MUCH DID YOU FROM WHAT WHAT WAS THE FEEL DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY FEEL. AND WHAT YOU IN THE ACADEMY. SO I. THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY IDEA TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO GO BACK THROUGH. AND SEE CONTRASTING COMPARED TO WHAT YOU WERE TAUGHT TO WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET. AND HOW MUCH DID IT HOW. MUCH OF IT TOOK AND HOW MUCH OF IT. SENIOR OUT. YEAH IT. THE TRAINING AND I THINK A LOT AT IT NOW THAT WE ALL BODY WORKING IN MIND IF I WEREN'T HERE THE AT MAYBE TO GIVE I DISAGGREGATED STUDY A VIDEO THIS HE MUCH. YOUR TRAINING IS THAT USED TO FEEL YOU KNOW HOW WELL HOW THE TACTICS YOU SEE INCIDENTS OF RAPES BIAS TO SEE IF THERE WHERE. I THINK HER YEAH FOR IT LATER IN THE SEASON WHERE THINGS ARE BEING HANDLED WELL. WE HEAR ABOUT THE THAT GO BECAUSE THEY WERE. BUT ALSO EVERY. ONE PERSON OFFICERS ARE DOING THEIR AND THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT HERE ABOUT IT BECAUSE DOING THEIR JOB. RIGHT BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED BE. THAT WOULD BE ALSO SOMETHING THAT TRICK THAT. WE CAN LOOK AT AND SAY WHAT EVERY DAY. THEY'RE DOING GOOD THANKS. SO IT. IT WOULD BE A GOOD. TO GO AND LOOK. WHAT WE'RE EVERY DAY IN OUR MAKE IT RIGHT. AND FINALLY TO. AT THAT. THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER DEADLY CHAIR. UP IT'S A GREAT IDEA SHARE I AM I TOOK ON I THINK ADULT VIDEOS FANTASTIC. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WHETHER AT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER CAN SPIT BACK THE INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE GIVEN IN THE CLASS I'M INTERESTED DO THEY ACTUALLY LIVE WHEN THEIR APPS FIELD THAT'S WE KNOW THE TRAINING WAS SUCCESSFUL AND I LOVE THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT THOSE VIDEOS THE SAME WHEN IT DIDN'T WORK AND WHEN IT DID WORK AND FOCUSING ON G. LET'S LOOK AT THE NOW LET'S DO A DEEPER DIVE AND SEE WE'RE TRAINING THE CURRENT IN THE AREA WHERE THEY WORK WELL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. IN ONE JURISDICTION. IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ANOTHER. WE ALL OF US WHETHER WE'RE TRAVEL LAYERS OR LEGISLATORS I ASSUME. SOMETHING BECOMES RELEVANT WHEN WE HAVE TO BEFORE. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S DISCUSSING YOUR BILL OR IF YOU NEED WHEN I USED TO BE A TRY WE'RE GOING TO TRIAL. I HAD NO INTEREST IN ARTS AND UNTIL I HAVE PROSECUTED ARSON MURDER CRIME AND THEN I WANT TO BE AN ARSON EXPERTS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE. WHO DID NOT STAND ARE SET. SO MANY THINGS WE TEACH IN THE ACADEMY AREN'T RELEVANT UNTIL THEY'RE RELEVANT. SO ANOTHER PART TO THIS IS I WOULD NOT ONLY ONE TO TWO YEAR FOLLOW UP. TO YOUR QUESTION. THAT TALKED ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES AND SPECIFICALLY SAY. TELL US YOU TOOK A CLASS IN THE US. TELL US WHEN YOU APPLY THIS IN THIS SITUATION AND WHAT HAPPENED. I LOVE ALL THAT MUCH BECAUSE HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE ON ALL THAT. I'M TAKING NOTES NOW BE TALKING TO DIRECTOR OPERATES. I LOVE WITH FOLKS GET HOMEWORK. I AM. DO YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO- GATHER HONEST FEEDBACK ON THE IMPACT THAT THE TRAININGS HAVE ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE OF A DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE. YOU KNOW ON THE CULTURE WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT RIGHT THE CHALLENGES WITH RECRUITMENT WITH RETENTION. YOU KNOW HAVING SOME SORT OF HONEST ASSESSMENT OF THE DEFICIENCIES WHICH SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY COME FROM LEGISLATURE LET'S JUST SAY THE LEGISLATURE- ARE YOU GUYS ABLE TO. GET THAT INFORMATION WOULD THAT ALSO BE SOMETHING HELPFUL TO YOU TO HAVE. YEAH IT'S A FUN FOR YOUR TWO YEAR POLICE OFFICER YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA GET A MORE HONEST ANSWER THING YOU'RE- CRANKY TWENTY FIVE YEAR- CRESSKILL COP DOESN'T. YEAH I'VE BEEN THERE DONE THAT KIND OF THING BUT FROM YOUR YOUNGER OFFICERS- THEY CERTAINLY INVOLVED FROM WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND IF YOU ESTABLISHED THAT DIALOGUE IS. THE ABILITY TO GO BACK AND FORTH. I THINK YOU CAN GET I THINK I COULD WALK TO BE MY DAD RIGHT NOW THEY'LL GIVE YOU AN HONEST ANSWER TO ANYTHING. WE'RE A SMALL AGENCY AND WORK FIRST NAME BASIS. I LOST MY FIRST NAME WHEN I GOT LUCKY SURE BUT- WE DO HAVE THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION. AB YEAH. I DON'T KNOW THEY WOULD NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF. ASSURING THAT THEY CAN SPEAK OPENLY. THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO GET PUNISHED IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT MY BOSS BOB I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT LAST NIGHT I'M CERTAIN THAT THERE'S NO REPERCUSSIONS OR SAYING. YEAH IT WOULD NEED TO BE SOME SORT OF ASSURANCE. THAT THEY CAN'T SPEAK LIKE AND OTHER. YOU'RE I'M I GUESS ASK THIS OF- CHAIR DOUBLE. HOW YOU AND WE TO A BIT ABOUT THIS EARLIER TODAY HOW HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHEN THE TRAINING ISN'T WORKING- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT. DOES THAT CRITERIA LOOK LIKE OR WHAT ARE THE DETERMINANTS. WHAT WHAT WOULD BE WHAT AGAIN GOING BACK TO THEIR ACTIONS IF WE ANALYZE AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING AND WE SEE HERE READING ABOUT SOME VERY BAD DECISIONS BEING MADE WE GO BACK TO THE TRAINING AND STATE WHAT LET'S TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR OFFICER WHAT TRAINING TO BE HAPPY AND THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THE TRAINING WASN'T THIS PARTICULAR OFFICER. WHO DIDN'T GET IT WHAT WAS THAT THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING I LOVE THE IDEA OF LOOKING VIDEOS BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT VIDEO SO WE COULD GATHER TWENTY BIT MANY OF THE STOCKS ARE ABOUT SHRINK. SHOOTINGS ARE NOW ON VIDEO WE CAN GATHER THAT STATE WHERE THE OUTLINES YEAR WITH THE PROBLEMS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE COMES TOWARD YOU WITH A KNIFE SO WHEN THEY COME TOWARD YOU WITH THE CAR- WHAT'S THE DISTANCE AND ALL OF THAT IS OCCURRING. AND THROUGH LOOKING AT VIDEOS AND THROUGH ANALYZING SITUATIONS AND IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED TO SHARE WELL I THINK THE IDEA OF HOW YOU GET ON THE STREET THAT. AND I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT TO SOME EXTENT WITH THE- QUESTIONNAIRES IS ALSO QUESTIONS WELL WRITTEN AND I THINK THEY CAN BE WELL WRITTEN BY PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SO I CAN OFTEN READ ONE OF THESE CAPS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW DEFENDANTS IN TERMS BINOCULARS VERY USED IN SATURDAY AND THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO CHANGE. THEIR BELIEFS IN THAT PERSON'S ANSWER SO LET'S USE OUR SCIENTISTS. NOT PSYCHOLOGISTS TO GET THAT TO. YEAH I AND I WAS JUST SPEAKING. TO USER FOR. I THINKING ABOUT- ALL OF THE- RIGHT THAT YOU ARE ARE IN- REQUIRED TO DO ARE ENCOURAGED TO DO. I DON'T KNOW SURE FRONT IF YOU WANTED TO ADD. THE CARD- DO EITHER OF YOU THINK AND I'LL LET YOU SURE FRONT GO FIRST THAT WE'RE DOING ENOUGH AS IT RELATES TO- THE MENTAL HEALTH. OF OFFICERS- THAT WE- HIRE AND HAVE THAT IS BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER ISSUE- FOR GENERAL DISCUSSION BUT ALSO AS IT RELATES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL HAVE TO REVEAL ITSELF AND- TRAININGS WHICH OF COURSE I JUST TOLD YOU I'M LEERY OF- TO SOME EXTENT BUT- ARE. ARE YOU SEEING THAT IS SORT OF THE NEXT. HURDLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO OVERCOME. I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR OFFICE DIRECT. RIGHT SO THAT IS A BIG CONCERN BECAUSE- SUICIDE IS. MUCH HIGHER MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAN ANY OTHER FASHION AND OF COURSE WE HAVE ACCESS THAT MEANS A LOT MORE THAN OTHERS DO SO IT IS A STRESSFUL JOB AND IT IS ALSO. A MACHO JOB WE DON'T WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. ANY SORT OF THIS SEVEN TO SAY THAT YOU NEED HELP IS THERE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. SO IT'S HARD TO ASK FOR HELP WITH YOUR- SO HOW DO YOU SEE ALL- AND OVER IN THE SURE THAT. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. YOU JUST HAVE TO SEND THEM. TO HELP EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVEN'T ASKED FOR IT SO WE NOT MUCH HAPPENS YOU'RE GONNA COUNTY IT'S VERY SMALL. YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF CRIMES BUT WHEN SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN IT'S SUPER TRAUMATIC IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT HUNDRED FACSIMILE HE INDICATED IT DOESN'T BOTHER LEVINE I DON'T THINK HE'S MAKING OR SEEN THAT OR- NOT. THAT MEANT EVERYTHING THAT'S RIGHT SOMEONE. TO COUNSELING- AND WE USE OUR PURPOSE AND CAN'T BREAKING UP BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT RESOURCE HERE AND SAID GO. TALK DON'T TALK. ABOUT IT YOU NEED TO GO AND HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO TALK WITH SOMEBODY AND SEE IF IT'S REALLY BOTHERING YOU OR IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE OKAY. SO MENTAL HEALTH IS SUPER IMPORTANT FOR LONG PART BEFORE STANDING AND- TIED INTO THAT IS PHYSICAL HEALTH PHYSICAL FITNESS. YOUR MARKET YOU ARE PHYSICALLY THE MARKET YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXACTLY- INTO ALLOW TIME FOR PEOPLE SHE- AS SHE DOES. IT'S A SUPER. STRESSFUL PHYSICAL SOMETIMES WE NEED TO SURE THAT WE AT BASICALLY IN THE MOST. FOR IT TO FIRST. AMONG OUR PEERS. IS FALLING ON. EMOTIONALLY IF THERE'S- TO GET AID. HI INCIDENT THEY WITNESS YEAH AREN'T WITH THE WELL. YEAH THE RESOURCES. IN WE HAVE. COUNSELORS HE'S JUST HANK OR OF SIGN UP ALL. WORST CASE SCENARIO YOU REALLY THINK SUMMER THE HARD STUFF TO TAKE THEIR WEAPONS AWAY THEM UNTIL THEY HAVE SEEN AND- IT'S THAT THERE GOT YOUR- WE NEED TO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PRESERVE THEIR MENTAL. BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT MEANT FIT AND THERE ARE STREET. THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR JOB THEY'RE GOING TO SERVICE THE COMMUNITY AND THAT COULD CAUSE FURTHER CLARK. AND I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING SOMEBODY OUT OF STATE BUT THEY'RE NOT EMOTIONALLY OR ACTUALLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT. MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS I'LL ASK THIS ONE OF- COMMISSIONER DEADLY. AND YOU AS YOU KNOW I'M FROM LOS ANGELES AND WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES AND IN OUR DISTRICT- SO GIVEN THE PROLIFERATION OVER THE DECADE OF CRIMINAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GANGS- AND I'M THINKING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY OUT THE LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT- WE'RE WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION- WHAT. IN POSTS SELECTION CRITERIA IS DESIGNED TO WEED OUT PEOPLE WHO ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS KIND OF GANG MENTALITY. I WANT TO MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR QUESTION IT'S HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS YOU MIGHT BE BRINGING ON. AREN'T SUSCEPTIBLE TO BECOMING GANG MEMBERS THEMSELVES WORK WORK WELL SOMETIMES IT'S THEM BECOMING SOMETIMES ARE ALSO PART OF SOME CLICK BEFORE HAND- AND IT'S JUST SORT OF- MAYBE INSTITUTIONALIZED OR FOMENTED- EVEN MORE DEEPLY WITH THEM COMING INTO A PARTICULAR DIVISION OR DEPARTMENT- BUT REGARDLESS I THINK WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY. OF ANALYZING THE CULTURE IN THESE PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT A BREEDING GROUND FOR THIS AND OR THAT WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THAT YOU KNOW MARKERS IN THE PARTICULAR DIVISION OR DEPARTMENT- THAT ARE. LEADING SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY AND BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ULTIMATELY- THOSE THINGS EIGHT ELEVATE DISTRUST. DE ESCALATE FEAR. C. RESULT AND LAWSUITS MISCONDUCT- INTEGRATOR AROSE IN OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY. YEAH OKAY STAND NOW- I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON SCREENING SCREENING WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON A MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION THAT'S DONE FOR ALL POSSIBLE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THEN I THINK TO BUTTRESS ON YOUR LAST QUESTION. I THINK WE NEED. ONCE I'M HIRING I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CHECK UPS THROUGHOUT PEOPLE'S CAREER I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING PRE HAB BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A TRAUMA BASED PROFESSION SO WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN DRAMA I'M GOING TO RESPOND IN A CERTAIN WAY AND ONE OF THOSE WAYS COULD BE TO BECOME VIOLENT THEMSELVES AND TO TAKE A LOT OF BULLYING. OF PERSONALITY THEMSELVES COULD BE THERE BEFORE THEY GET IN OR THEY COULD DEVELOP IT SO BY DOING THE MENTAL HEALTH CHECKUPS BY DOING THE PRE HAPPY PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO- MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ALONG THE WAY- I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THAT- I WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU ASKED SHERIFF. OKAY AS- MENTAL HEALTH AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME- TWO YEARS AGO I PUT ON A CONFERENCE IN SANTA BARBARA ABOUT JUST THAT. I'M BECAUSE- MY SON IS A FIREFIGHTER HOUSTON HE WAS HAD POST TRAUMATIC INJURIES RESULT SAVING. OKAY YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER FIREFIGHTERS SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND THE KINDS OF THINGS HE SAW THAT NIGHT WILL STICK WITH HIM FOREVER. AS A RESULT OF THAT HE JOINED THE PEER SUPPORT ANY ALSO GOT A COMFORT DOG THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WHEN THE FIREFIGHTERS BEEN TO OUR- RIFIC EVENT. HE GOES THERE WITH HIS PEER SUPPORT JACKET HIS JOB TO HELP THEM COME ALONG. NO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE FIRST RESPONDER BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY IF WE HAVE TRAUMATIZED FIRST RESPONDERS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE WELL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THAT KIND OF TRAUMA. THEY GONNA HAVE TO FACE THE VERY NEXT DAY. WELL TRUE THAT'S TRUE. I'M I. JERRY BROWN YEAH THIS CAME UP IN OUR- DISCUSSION AND IT WAS A QUESTIONS FLASHPOINT OF CONVERSATION- WHICH I HOPE OUR- WAY WILL KIND OF INFORM THE WORK THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO ON POST IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL. BUT YOU DID ADAM MENTIONED THAT YOUR FIFTH DAY ON THE JOB YOUR UNIT RESPONDED TO THE RODNEY KING INCIDENT- WHICH IN MY MIND SEEM TO BE THE GENESIS OF SORT OF YOU KNOW PUBLIC RECORDINGS AND SHARING- HOW OFFICERS INTERACT WITH SUBDUE WOULD DE ESCALATE- THE FOLKS THAT THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH AND THEN FAST FORWARD. YOU KNOW WE JUST BEEN TWO YEAR DEALING WITH- DEREK CHAU VAN AND GEORGE FLOYD. AND THERE'S SO MUCH IRONY- IN THAT BECAUSE SOME FOLKS WOULD ARGUE THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY. MADE HUGE CHANGES- AND HOW OFFICERS. RESPOND TO CERTAIN FOLKS INTO CERTAIN SITUATIONS I JUST WANTED TO KNOW YOUR SORT OF PERSPECTIVE ON THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN URBAN BEEN AND RURAL. YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY ELEVATED- IN RANK THROUGHOUT THE YEARS- AND- I MEAN. IS THERE HOPE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE- IN THE FACT THAT CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE BECAUSE FOR SOME IT WOULD SEEM NOT AT ALL FOR OTHERS IT WOULD SEEM IMPERCEPTIBLE. BUT THAT CERTAINLY CANNOT BE THE NARRATIVE. RIGHT SO CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT NATIONWIDE CHANGES THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HOW WE APPROACH THINGS AND CERTAINLY THE RODNEY KING INCIDENT WAS A SEMINAL MOMENT AND IT CHANGED LAW ENFORCEMENT CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY LOS EXPERTS FROM THE WEST COAST. WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND IT TAKES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL THEY CATCH UP AND WHAT HAPPENS SHE DIRECTLY. WITH ORDER AND THEIR SHARED. HORRIBLE. I'M SURE GIVE ALL IT SAID IT AND I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO. OKAY YOU SAID WHAT HAPPENED THERE WAS RIGHT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO SUPPORTS THAT. BUT IT HAPPENED SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN SO WE DO NEED A NATIONWIDE CHAIN I THINK THERE'S MORE NATIONAL EFFORTS- STANDARDIZATION ON THIS THE CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER IN THERE IS EVEN A RODNEY KING THAT THEY WERE HEALTHY AFTER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THEY WERE CONVICTED OF EXCESSIVE FORCE YOU OUT OF THE FOR WORK- IN THERE IS HOPE IN THE FACT THAT THERE SHOULD WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER WHICH NEVER USED TO HAPPEN. IN A LOT OF FIRST USE. OF FORCE CASE. SO IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO THE FIRST PLACE BUT IT DOES HAPPEN YOU SHOULD BE THE CAMP FOR. AND THAT. THERE THERE IS. BUT SCHIFF- SO YES TO ANSWER. THE QUESTION THAT WAS MY FIFTH DAY ON THE JOB I WAS RUNNING IN AND IT DID CHANGE. MY CAREER SO I DON'T KNOW A MICROTURBINE ABOUT. WHAT I STILL BE HERE WOULD BE HERE RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW. SOMETIMES I LOOK AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR AND SAY HOW DID YOU GET HERE- I NEVER EXPECTED. TO BE IN EXACTLY WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. IF THAT MAKES SENSE. IT DOES. IT AT EACH TAUGHT ME A LOT IT TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT EMPATHY IT TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT AS I WORK INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR SIX YEARS BUT I STARTED MY CAREER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE S. NUMBER BEING INTERVIEWED BY. SO I'VE LEARNED. A LOT OF IS A LEADER HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE HOW TO TREAT A COMMUNITY HAS SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT HOLDING ANYTHING BACK BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT YOU ALL BACK TO THE COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY THE SITUATION LIKE THAT IT WILL COME TO LIGHT ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FOR PROFIT SHARING WE NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT WE NEED SURE EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN SHARE AND AS SOON AS WE CAN HERE AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF. THE BODY WORN CAMERAS IN THE HURDY ANALYSIS WHAT WAS UNEXPECTED WITH THE RODNEY KING INCIDENT BECAUSE NOBODY WAS EXPECTING THAT THAT WAS DONE I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY ELSE DOWN YEAH IS THAT STANDARD WE KNOW THAT EVERYTHING WE DO ALL DAY EVERY DAY IT'S RECORDING AND IF YOU HAVE PASSED YOUR JOB TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY. AND TO BE MINDFUL THAT EVERYTHING YOU DO AND SAY WELL IF RECORDED SOMEBODY WILL SEE IT AND YOU SHOULD DO YOUR JOB RIGHT YOU SHOULD DO YOUR JOB RIGHT ANYWAY. WHAT BUT YOU ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE- INTERNET. PEOPLE ARE ONCE AND THAT'S CHANGED EVERYTHING WITH RUNNING PEOPLE ARE WHAT AND THEY SHOULD BE WATCH WE SHOULD BE WATCHING A LOT WHAT WE GIVE IS VERY PUBLIC YOUR SAFETY AND THEY SHOULD BE WHAT WE GET WE SHOULD BE. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I CAN. AGREE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING US ALL THE TIME TO- I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL BOTH FOR YOUR- WILLINGNESS AND DESIRE TO DO THAT JOB SHERIFF AND TO CONTINUE TO DO THE JOB. SHARE DEADLY AND- JUST WANNA LEAVE YOU WITH THE FACT THAT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS- FOR POST AND FOR THIS WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TRUST. AND HOW WE FIND WAYS TO BUILD IT. AND SUSTAIN IT- IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK. OUT WE CAN. ELEVATE IN THIS KIND OF WORK SO I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT- IN BOTH OF YOUR PROFESSIONS- TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE WITH POST THANK YOU.
