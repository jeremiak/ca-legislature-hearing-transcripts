WE RECEIVED ON THIS BILL THEY

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.771
ARE PURELY ADVISORY BODY. AS AN

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.139
EXAMPLE OF THE BENEFICIAL ROLE

SIGNS TO LOOK OUT FOR AND MORE.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:55.728
UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA LAW

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.830
CURRENTLY LIMITS THESE TEAMS TO

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.517
WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT IF WE ARE

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.352
ALLOWED TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.319
COVERAGE HERE SO THAT WE LISTEN

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.155

STATE PROPERTY IT'S AGAINST OUR

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:23.788
VALUES. AND WE KNOW THAT. HAVING

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:26.190
MORE GUNS MEANS THAT MORE PEOPLE

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:28.025
GET SHOT. THAT'S LIKE THAT

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:30.027
EMPIRICALLY PROVEN OVER AND OVER

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.996
AGAIN THE WHOLE NOTION THAT THE

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:35.065
ONLY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD PEOPLE

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:35.933
ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.035
AROUND GOING ON CRIME SPREES

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.603
TRAGEDY THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE

NATURE SO MANY SHOOTINGS HAPPEN

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:53.050
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT NOT

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.018
BECAUSE SOMEONE WENT OUT

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.886
INTENDING ORIGINALLY TO KILL

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:58.022
SOMEONE THE MORE GUNS WE HAVE

00:40:58.088 --> 00:41:00.758
THE MORE PEOPLE. GET SHOT AND

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:02.259
SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU

00:41:02.326 --> 00:41:03.394
SAW SHOOTINGS IN CALIFORNIA

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.396
DESPITE YOUR STRONG LAWS AREBUT

FACT THEY'RE MORE SHOOTINGS THAT

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:12.503
HAPPENED NEAR THE MATA GET THE

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.072
NEVADA BORDER BECAUSE IN THE

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.608
BOTTOM THERE ARE LOOSER. LAWS O

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:21.278
HAVING LESS ACCESS TO GUNS-

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:24.248
MEANS FEWER PEOPLE- GOT SHOT AND

FEWER PEOPLE- DIED- AND SO I

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:30.120

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.109
THOSE OF US WHO WATCHED IN

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:02.445

CONSEQUENCES. ONE COULD IMAGINE

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:11.354
SOME VERY SEVERE CONSEQUENCES.

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:14.457
FROM THAT DAY. THAT COULD HAVE

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:20.764
INCLUDED- WELL FIRST OFF THE-

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.666

PRESIDENT IN HIS ROLE TO CERTIFY

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:42.719
THE ELECTION- AND IT COULD'VE

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:45.388
COST POTENTIALLY A LACK OF

00:53:45.455 --> 00:53:46.523
CERTIFICATION OF A LEGITIMATE

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:51.361
ELECTION. SO UP ND EVERY ASPECT

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:54.397
OF WHAT WE THREE KAMAR CHRISSY

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:56.800
IS A MESSY BUSINESS JUST BECAUSE

00:53:56.866 --> 00:53:59.269
IT'S THE NATURE OF IT IS SUCH

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:04.307
THAT- WE ALLOW. VOTERS TO CHOOSE

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:06.176

DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION AS LONG

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:15.952
AS THEY ARE. ACTING WITHIN THEIR

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:17.320
- DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:19.489
THEN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:20.890
MOVE IN DIRECTIONS THAT YOU KNOW

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:23.326
SOME OF US DON'T AGREE WITH. BUT

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:25.762
IN THIS CASE. IN ANY

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:26.663
INTERPRETATION OF THE

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.098
CONSTITUTION THAT WAS A

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:30.033

CONSEQUENCES COULD BE COULD HAVE

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.075
BEEN SO SEVERE AND COULD STILL

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:41.778
IMPACT NOT ONLY THE STATE. THE

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:44.881
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. BUT IF HE

ALL OF US AS INDIVIDUALS. THAT I

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:49.486
THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:50.987
US TO ASK THE STATE OF

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:53.923

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT A PROPER

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:58.361

MANY MILLIONS OF. OF VOTES IN

ALREADY- GET SCREWED OVER BY

00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:33.783
HAVING TWO UNITED STATES

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.885
SENATORS THE SAME AS- NORTH

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.120
DAKOTA AND RHODE ISLAND NO

DISRESPECT TO THOSE STATES BUT

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:39.556
WE ARE DRAMATICALLY

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:42.425
UNDERREPRESENTED. IN THE U. S.

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:43.359
SENATE AND ALSO IN THE ELECTORAL

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:46.296
COLLEGE- BUT THE LEAST. THEY CAN

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:48.765
DO IS COUNT OUR VOTES FOR

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.099
PRESIDENT AND- DIS

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:51.568
INSURRECTIONIST WE'RE TRYING TO

COLLAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR-

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:03.446
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I MOVED

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:07.283
THE BILL- IS BECAUSE I DO THINK

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.185
THAT CALIFORNIA IS A BELLWETHER

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:11.287
STATE AND HOPEFULLY IF THIS IS

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:14.157
PASSED- IT WILL ENCOURAGE OTHER

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:16.392
STATES. TO LOOK AT LEGISLATION

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:18.695
VERY SIMILAR TO THIS- THE

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:22.265
INSURRECTION ONJANUARY SIXTH-

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:23.633
NEEDS TO BE THOROUGHLY

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.302
INVESTIGATED NOT ONLY WERE

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:28.238
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS PUT AT RISK

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:30.340
AND THE VICE PRESIDENT. BUT

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:34.244
ALSO. TEAMS OF STAFF AND IN. WHO

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.779
GO TO THOSE BUILDINGS EVERY DAY

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:39.215
TO DO THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE AND

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:41.584
HOPEFULLY THIS INVESTIGATION

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:44.354
WILL ALLOW US TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.022
TO PROPERLY TRAIN AND SUPPORT

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:50.360
THOSE. STAFF WHO COME IN EVERY

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:53.496
DAY TO PROVIDE CRITICAL

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:55.932
CONSTITUENT SERVICES TO THE

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.033
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.202
AMERICANS AND CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:01.838
ARE DESERVING OF A GOVERNMENT

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:04.274
THAT WORKS FOR THEM. WHEN THE

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.542
OTHER REALITY IS THAT JANUARY

00:59:06.609 --> 00:59:11.147
SIXTH TRIGGERED AN AVALANCHE OF

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:15.451
VOLATILITY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:17.553
THAT NOW HINGES ON THE

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.055
IRRATIONAL AND I THINK WE NEED

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:23.092
AN INVESTIGATION TO ALLOW US TO

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:25.895
COME BACK TO SOME SHARED TRUTHS

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:28.564
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ALLOW US TO

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:31.301
MEND A VERY FRAGILE AND YET

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.902
INTERNATIONALLY CRITICAL

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:36.306
DEMOCRACY SO THAT IS WHY I WILL

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:37.774
BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY.

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:59.662
FIVE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES

FIRE IF NOT EVERYONE OF THOSE

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:31.661
INDIVIDUALS WERE PROSECUTED BUT

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.863
IN THE FACT MAJORITY MORE WHITE
